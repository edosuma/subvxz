00:02.903 --> 00:06.874
Dean, what was that about?
All those shots after the shifter was dead.

00:07.074 --> 00:08.834
Sure it wasn't
something to do with the mark?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.989
- None of that.
- Look, I gotta be honest...

00:11.178 --> 00:12.919
I was a little anxious,
I wanted to make sure it was done right.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.490
- Why am I even explaining this to you'?
- Dean, I...

00:17.017 --> 00:18.257
How did you do it?

00:18.485 --> 00:20.021
Magic.
- We're here for the witch.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.325
- Rowena.
- Always nice to be recognized.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.696
- We got her.
- Time for the coup de grace.

00:28.896 --> 00:32.207
Something the matter, my dear?
Mother.

00:33.166 --> 00:36.204
My name is Jimmy Novak.
I'm from Pontiac, Illinois.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.383
I have a family, Amelia and Claire.

00:38.605 --> 00:42.519
Bless this food
and ourselves to thy loving service. Amen.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.854
- Hi, Daddy.
- You're possessing some poor bastard?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.754
Castiel, you promised me my family
would be okay.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.691
What of the humans
whose lives we sacrifice?

00:51.885 --> 00:54.695
Maybe it's time to put them first.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.599
Get your hands off me, perv.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.996
I'll sue your ass.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.335
- What was it this time?
Shoplifting.

01:36.563 --> 01:39.169
The guy ain't looking to press charges,
but I figured you'd want her back.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.812
That's 48 hours in isolation.

01:41.001 --> 01:44.107
Oh, scary.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.163
Who is this girl?

02:08.362 --> 02:10.364
One of our frequent flyers.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.106
Claire Novak.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.552
Novak, you got a visitor.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.825
- Really?
- Your father's here to see you.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.633
- Daddy.
- I am not your father.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.798
Hello, Claire.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.068
It's been a long time.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.321
Can we have a moment?

03:02.416 --> 03:04.054
I'll be outside.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.366
I'm not your father.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.867
Right.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.334
"I'm not your father."

03:17.531 --> 03:20.535
Those were the first words
you ever said to me. Remember?

03:22.436 --> 03:24.109
I remember everything.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.078
So do I, Castiel.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.779
My dad...

03:31.011 --> 03:33.082
...is he still in there?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.055
No.

03:37.451 --> 03:43.800
The human soul can only occupy a body while
it retains a certain structural integrity...

03:44.024 --> 03:48.803
...and this vessel was ripped apart
on a subatomic level by an archangel.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.276
- Well, then how are you...?
- I was reassembled.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.245
Your father is in heaven.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.643
Well, ya? for him.

03:58.872 --> 04:03.116
Anyway, good talk.
You can get the hell out of my life now.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.451
- Claire.
- What?

04:06.213 --> 04:07.624
Huh?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.454
What?

04:09.716 --> 04:12.492
You took everything from me.
What do you want now?

04:12.719 --> 04:14.289
Nothing. I just...

04:17.891 --> 04:20.098
I came here to help you.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.463
Why?

04:24.498 --> 04:26.444
Because I've hurt you so much.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.344
Where is your mother?

04:36.443 --> 04:39.185
About a few months after you...

04:39.412 --> 04:40.982
...she took off.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.958
Dropped me off at my grandma's
and went to go find herself.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.494
I guess she's still looking.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.840
And... And you're in child prison?

04:57.197 --> 04:58.835
It's a group home.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.842
After my gran died, I didn't have anyone...

05:02.035 --> 05:05.710
...so I bounced around different
foster families, places like this.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.941
Living the dream, you know?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.454
Look, Claire, I'm sorry...

05:13.647 --> 05:17.026
...and I can never replace
what I took from you.

05:17.217 --> 05:20.130
But if there is anything you need.
Anything at all.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.835
Get me out of here.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.968
How?

05:31.565 --> 05:33.567
Do you own a tie?

05:36.403 --> 05:38.349
Stop it.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.086
There.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.316
Now you look like a dad.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.256
No, no.

05:54.921 --> 05:57.595
So, Mr. Novak...

05:57.824 --> 06:00.703
...I understand you want custody
of your daughter.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.937
Yes. That's, uh... That's, ahem...

06:05.232 --> 06:06.540
That's right.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.769
Why?

06:09.336 --> 06:10.440
Excuse me?

06:10.670 --> 06:12.411
It's a simple question.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.517
You vanish for years.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.220
No contact, not even a Christmas card.

06:17.410 --> 06:18.582
Why come back now?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.920
I didn't, uh...

06:24.251 --> 06:26.561
- I was traveling.
- For work.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.903
Work. Yes.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.429
Long trip.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.804
And what is it that you do exactly?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.407
I, um...

06:45.105 --> 06:47.779
I fight certain deadly threats to humanity.

06:49.809 --> 06:52.289
- He's an exterminator.
- I'm an exterminator.

06:52.879 --> 06:53.914
Uh-huh.

06:57.317 --> 07:00.230
You know, I think I might have bedbugs.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.991
- Any tips?
- Of course.

07:03.223 --> 07:07.000
You should sleep tight
and not let them bite.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.935
I'll try that.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.273
It doesn't matter.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.512
He's my dad...

07:16.736 --> 07:19.148
...and he wants to sign me out, so I'm out.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.080
That's the law, Sandy.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.985
Claire, wait for me in the hallway.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.924
- You can't...
- Now.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.032
I don't do well with liars.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.933
- But...
- Save it.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.432
I'm denying your application for custody.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.645
I'm not trying to be the bad guy here.
I'm not.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.679
But until Claire turns 18,
she is my responsibility.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.816
I know you're trying to do
what you think is best.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.879
I know you wanna be her friend.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.849
- I do.
- And that's our problem, Mr. Novak.

08:01.047 --> 08:04.460
Claire's troubled. The last few
years have not been easy for her.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.825
And she doesn't need a friend.
She needs a father.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.137
Easy now.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.645
What are you laughing at?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.542
Hey, hang on.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.881
You gotta see this, it's a classic.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.489
- I'm glad you're feeling better.
- Better than ever.

08:35.081 --> 08:38.528
Oh, hello, beautiful.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.857
Oh, yeah. Mm.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.734
You want some alone time with that thing?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.664
Mm. No, wait.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.068
- You sure?
- Yeah, yep. Watch this.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.190
Oh, don't be impa...

09:12.585 --> 09:16.089
No. Stop. Stop!

09:30.136 --> 09:32.207
It's you. What's going on?

09:33.206 --> 09:34.651
Getting you out of here.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.152
Is he...?

09:43.383 --> 09:45.260
Sleeping-

10:00.834 --> 10:02.677
Sit.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.653
Stay.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.291
Good dog.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.290
Wait.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.529
My son.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.464
I need to talk to him.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.540
It's been weeks.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.612
Tell him I'm sorry.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.540
Tell him...

10:52.685 --> 10:53.720
Yeah?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.392
Nothing.

10:56.623 --> 11:00.332
It's just... You could eat a vegetable.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.062
Ketchup's a vegetable.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.970
You've changed.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.740
The Castiel I met...

11:10.470 --> 11:11.972
...he was crappy.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.742
Like, super stuck-up and a dick...

11:13.973 --> 11:17.079
...and you just wanted to punch him
in his stupid angel face.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.312
I don't think I was that bad.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.582
You totally were.

11:22.982 --> 11:24.427
And now, you're just...

11:24.651 --> 11:27.154
I don't know. Nicer.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.833
And kind of a doof, no offense.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.165
Yes, well, um...

11:36.362 --> 11:39.366
...before, I was very self-assured.

11:39.566 --> 11:43.104
I was convinced
I was on this righteous path.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.247
Now I realize there's no righteous path.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.079
It's just people
trying to do their best in a world...

11:49.242 --> 11:51.415
...where it's far too easy
to do your worst.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.351
Wow. Deep.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.289
Yeah, for a doof.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.396
Thank you.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.901
So where do we go next?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.536
Look...

12:09.729 --> 12:12.471
...I appreciate the meal...

12:12.632 --> 12:15.579
...and, you know, the felony,
but you don't need to babysit me.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.715
- I can take care of myself.
- What do you mean?

12:19.272 --> 12:21.047
I mean, you felt guilty...

12:21.241 --> 12:22.652
...so you busted me out.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.481
So thanks, but we're good.

12:25.712 --> 12:26.782
Even step hen.

12:27.547 --> 12:31.791
No, we committed a crime
and you might need me again.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.965
So I think we should stick together.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.898
Okay.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.136
You wanna get some stuff for the road, huh?

12:45.331 --> 12:46.776
I have to pee.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.573
Okay.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.416
- Sorry.
- My bad.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.270
It's for a teenage girl.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.702
She's urinating.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.389
My wallet's gone.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.730
Hey, hey, hey-

13:44.957 --> 13:47.665
Hey, can you help-l? Damn.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.068
Help. Please.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.576
- Claire.
- Oh, thank you.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.182
- Go, go, go.
- Wait.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.374
Hey. Claire.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.995
This is why you called us?
This is your emergency?

14:19.926 --> 14:21.701
- Yes.
- No.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.339
Cass...

14:23.496 --> 14:25.100
An emergency is a dead body, okay?

14:25.331 --> 14:26.708
Or a wigged out angel...

14:26.899 --> 14:28.879
...or the Apocalypse, take three.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.705
Some chick bolting on you
is not an emergency. That's...

14:32.905 --> 14:36.352
- That's every Friday night for Sam.
- Dude.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.045
- Well...
- This isn't just "some chick."

14:39.245 --> 14:41.350
I'm responsible for her.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.426
Since when?
You met her once, how many years ago?

14:44.951 --> 14:48.398
Look, Cass, even if we do find Claire,
then what?

14:48.755 --> 14:52.931
She rolled you and then she ran, okay? It's
clear that she doesn't wanna play house.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.434
I understand.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.437
But I need to know that Claire is safe.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.109
And I need your help.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.971
All right.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.647
- Why don't we ask around at the group home?
- You know what?

15:08.875 --> 15:11.913
We're gonna stick here
in case she circles back. You go ahead.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.148
Thank you.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.991
Is ketchup a vegetable?

15:24.624 --> 15:25.659
Hell, yes.

15:27.326 --> 15:30.136
All right, so spill.
What's with the family reunion?

15:31.264 --> 15:32.299
I don't know.

15:32.498 --> 15:35.104
Just been thinking about people.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.004
I've...

15:38.838 --> 15:41.444
I've helped some but I've hurt some.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.353
So you're having a mid-life crisis.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.852
Well, I'm extremely old.
I think I'm entitled.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.194
Cass, listen to me.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.191
Some stuff you just gotta let go.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.994
Okay? The people you letdown...

16:00.193 --> 16:02.195
...the ones you can't save...

16:02.428 --> 16:04.806
...you gotta forget about them
for your own good.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.035
- That what you do?
- That's the opposite of what I do.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.442
But I ain't exactly a role model.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.483
That's not true.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.051
Yeah.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.054
How are you, Dean?

16:24.383 --> 16:25.885
Fine.

16:27.453 --> 16:28.557
I'm great.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.565
No, you're not.

16:35.061 --> 16:38.372
Yeah, well, I lost the black eyes,
so that's a plus.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.233
But I still have this.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.013
Is the Mark of Cain still affecting you?

16:46.572 --> 16:48.574
Dean?

16:49.408 --> 16:50.751
Dean?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.554
Cass, I need you to promise me something.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.224
Of course.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.758
If I do go dark side,
you gotta take me out.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.726
What do you mean?

17:07.693 --> 17:11.607
Knife me, smite me,
throw me into the freaking sun, whatever.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.441
And don't let Sam get in the way,
because he'll try.

17:18.003 --> 17:20.040
I can't go down that road again, man.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.121
I can't be that thing again.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.224
That won't work.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.555
I didn't ask you, Braveheart.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.760
Freedom.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.941
So, what are we in for?

17:49.402 --> 17:52.576
Small talk, darling. Just passing the time.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.078
I'm here because I shouldn't be here.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.322
Is that a riddle?

18:01.814 --> 18:05.057
Crowley only allows certain demons
to come Earth-side.

18:05.251 --> 18:08.664
I wasn't on the list,
so I had to get myself smuggled up.

18:09.121 --> 18:11.431
- And what did that cost?
- A favor.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.332
- Big?
- Bloody.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.573
Now, I figure the king lets me stew
for a while...

18:19.765 --> 18:23.679
...then he starts asking
how I Houdini'd hell.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.783
And he ain't gonna ask nice.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.347
What about you?

18:29.675 --> 18:31.018
What's your sin?

18:33.679 --> 18:36.125
I was a horrible mother.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.818
She was a horrible mother.

18:39.118 --> 18:43.863
I mean, did I tell you the time
that she almost traded me for three pigs?

18:44.090 --> 18:47.833
Three!
I was an attractive child, I could juggle.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.870
I was worth five pigs at least.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.367
My ma used to burn me with cigarettes.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.839
Nobody cares, Gerald.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.339
Don't get me started about the name.

19:00.539 --> 19:01.813
Fergus.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.545
Sounds like a venereal disease,
and not the fun kind.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.190
Look, boss...

19:10.383 --> 19:12.556
...if you hate this batty so much...

19:12.718 --> 19:14.527
...why not end her?

19:16.555 --> 19:18.125
I have my reasons.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.233
Oh, I killed my old lady...

19:22.695 --> 19:24.197
...because of the cigarettes.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.402
I have no problem doing yours.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.719
Claire's a good kid, detective.
She's smart...

19:35.908 --> 19:38.650
...and underneath it all,
she has a big heart.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.525
You know, there used to be a boy here,
Dustin Tate.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.356
He was older,
but Claire really took him under her wing.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.692
Is he around?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.162
He works at the Wiener Hut.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.765
We tried to place Claire,
but she always ran away.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.430
Sometimes for a couple of days,
one time for six months.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.244
Wow, where did she hide out?

20:01.867 --> 20:02.937
Wish I knew.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.082
Hey, Claire.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.780
Hey.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.594
- Is, uh, Randy here?
- Oh, look who's back.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.929
It's been, what, three days?

20:22.121 --> 20:24.101
I know, I got busted.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.066
But I come bearing gifts.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.807
There's like 200 bucks in there.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.804
James Novak.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.313
Any relation?

20:39.572 --> 20:42.246
No. He's just a guy.

20:44.577 --> 20:49.287
Well, I appreciate the elbow grease,
but, uh, we're still short.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.252
How much?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.754
Too much.

20:55.654 --> 20:58.635
- When's Salinger coming to collect?
- Tonight.

20:59.725 --> 21:02.604
It's my fault,
I shouldn't have borrowed so much money.

21:02.928 --> 21:08.469
But the holidays are coming
and I like to spoil my kids.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.182
- Maybe he'll give us more time.
- He's a loan shark.

21:13.339 --> 21:15.148
They're not so big on second chances.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.680
I kind of thought
you were gonna steal enough...

21:20.846 --> 21:23.690
...to pay down the debt
like we talked about, but...

21:24.850 --> 21:25.954
I tried.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.529
Not hard enough.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.538
Come on.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.334
One last family meal.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.873
There's gotta be something we could do.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.711
What?

21:49.175 --> 21:51.280
It's nothing. It's crazy.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.388
I'd do it if I was still under 18.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.555
Tell me.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.703
Dustin Tate?

22:09.361 --> 22:11.864
- No, man.
- Oh, really?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.401
Yes, you are.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.347
And you're gonna tell me
where Claire Novak is.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.716
Now.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.554
I'd do what he says.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.599
Quick in, quick out.

22:41.393 --> 22:42.736
Watch out for the cameras.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.532
Be careful.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.939
Wait until you're alone,
then you hit that register jockey hard.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.102
You put the fear of God in him, understand?

22:50.536 --> 22:52.072
Good.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.612
And you come back to me, you hear?

22:57.610 --> 23:01.114
You and Dustin, you're
the only family I got.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.428
Excuse us.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.567
- Claire, wait.
- Screw you.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.266
Hey, Miley Cyrus, settle.

23:53.499 --> 23:54.739
Eat me, Hasselhoff.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.242
Claire, hold on a second. Look.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.939
- My name...
- Sam. And you're Dean.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.510
We've met, remember?

24:05.678 --> 24:09.854
Claire, you were going to rob
that convenience store?

24:10.015 --> 24:11.688
So?

24:11.917 --> 24:13.453
"So?"

24:13.686 --> 24:16.257
So it's...

24:16.455 --> 24:17.525
it's wrong.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.261
You wanna talk to me about wrong?

24:20.592 --> 24:23.436
You killed my dad.
Is that wrong enough for you?

24:25.164 --> 24:27.440
- No, I didn't.
- Really?

24:27.766 --> 24:29.871
Because without you, he'd still be here.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.173
And my mom would still be around.

24:32.604 --> 24:35.448
- Claire, I...
- Don't.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.485
That won't hurt me.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.228
- Fine.
- Whoa, hey. Come on.

24:45.384 --> 24:49.389
- Hold on a second.
- Why? Like you don't have it coming?

24:50.556 --> 24:53.628
You stood there
while this monster took my dad.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.816
I used to pray to you, Castiel.

25:06.338 --> 25:10.252
Every night.
I would beg you to bring him home safe.

25:12.411 --> 25:13.583
I know.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.418
You know.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.429
My father was a good man.

25:22.654 --> 25:26.101
What messed up world does he have to die
and you get to live?

25:27.226 --> 25:29.729
- I'm sorry.
- No.

25:29.995 --> 25:32.737
You feel guilty. There's a difference.

25:33.932 --> 25:38.108
So what? Now you run back to Randy,
the guy you steal for?

25:40.105 --> 25:42.278
- How do you know about that?
- Dustin.

25:43.675 --> 25:44.745
Claire...

25:45.444 --> 25:47.446
...that man is using you.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.121
He was there for me...

25:50.282 --> 25:52.888
...when things got bad,
and they got real damn bad.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.394
He was there when no one else was.

25:57.456 --> 25:59.458
He's my family.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.800
And you're just...

26:04.530 --> 26:06.066
You can go to hell.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.063
Boss will see you now.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.933
Mother.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.166
- Fergus.
- Crowley.

26:42.501 --> 26:44.105
Fergus.

26:50.409 --> 26:51.820
So you haven't changed.

26:54.012 --> 26:56.322
But you certainly have.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.586
King of hell, bravo.

26:58.817 --> 27:01.764
- I always knew you were meant for big things.
- Really?

27:01.954 --> 27:07.199
As I remember, you said I would die
in a gutter, covered in my own sick.

27:08.026 --> 27:10.768
I was motivating you to do better.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.374
Aim higher.

27:12.531 --> 27:15.478
And clearly, it worked.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.214
How did you die?

27:22.374 --> 27:24.547
The point is...

27:24.710 --> 27:26.383
...you hated me.

27:26.645 --> 27:27.988
Oh, please.

27:28.213 --> 27:31.285
You said you'd be back in a flash,
and then you disappeared.

27:31.483 --> 27:35.954
- I was 8 years old, 8! I didn't even have a father.
- Oh, now you're being dramatic.

27:36.155 --> 27:40.797
Of course, you had a father. You were just
conceived during a winter solstice orgy...

27:40.993 --> 27:44.236
...and it's not like I was taking names.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.139
What do you want me to say?

27:48.367 --> 27:51.075
I had a disagreement with the locals...

27:51.236 --> 27:54.149
...and when they set their hounds on me,
I had to leave...

27:54.373 --> 27:57.081
And never come back for hundreds of years?

27:57.976 --> 28:00.422
Well, I'm here now.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.087
We have a second chance.

28:04.249 --> 28:07.093
We can be a real family again, Fergus.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.429
Crowley.

28:10.656 --> 28:11.999
And I have a family.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.095
Who, the demons?

28:15.260 --> 28:19.402
Any one of them would stab you in the back,
if they thought they could get away with it.

28:19.765 --> 28:24.339
- And you wouldn't.
- No, because we're family, we're blood.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.277
You can trust me.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.612
And I can help you.

28:31.610 --> 28:34.853
I understand you're angry.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.026
I understand that you...

28:38.217 --> 28:40.219
...hate me.

28:40.686 --> 28:43.462
And if you want to keep me locked away...

28:43.689 --> 28:45.965
...then so be it.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.136
But know...

28:48.293 --> 28:51.365
...that I'll always be your mother...

28:52.431 --> 28:54.638
...and I'll always love you.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.491
Give me a shot of...

29:11.383 --> 29:12.828
Three whiskeys.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.665
Cass.

29:16.822 --> 29:19.234
Don't beat yourself up, man. Claire was...

29:19.458 --> 29:20.732
Right.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.632
She was right.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.774
Who am I to tell her how to live her life?

29:24.997 --> 29:28.342
Well, somebody needs to. it's not like
we're talking about Mother Teresa.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.673
The girl just about knocked over
a Gas 'n Sip. She's got issues.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.405
Because of me.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.118
Well, you are wearing
her old man's meat suit.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.411
Probably didn't help.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.187
I thought I could make it up to her.

29:44.516 --> 29:45.859
I don't think you can.

29:46.685 --> 29:50.861
I mean, Jimmy was her father
and to some people that's...

29:51.423 --> 29:53.425
That's everything, you know?

29:54.026 --> 29:55.096
No.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.035
I don't. I never knew my father.

29:57.863 --> 30:00.036
He was distant, to say the least.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.613
What about you? Did you love your father?

30:10.208 --> 30:11.710
With everything I had.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.019
Yeah.

30:14.212 --> 30:17.216
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't always easy,
but yeah.

30:18.383 --> 30:22.957
I mean, look, John Winchester
is not gonna win any Number 1 Dad awards...

30:23.155 --> 30:25.066
...but he was there when we needed him.

30:25.724 --> 30:29.069
Hey, tell him about that time in New York.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.636
Oh, yeah.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.669
Yeah. Okay, so, uh...

30:35.901 --> 30:38.245
We were working this haunting
in Long Island...

30:38.470 --> 30:42.646
...and me and Sam beg the old man
to let us go to the city for once.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.412
He had this thing about New York.
Too big, loud, dirty.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.683
- Yeah, and he hated the Yankees.
- Big time, yeah.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.258
But somehow we convinced him
to let us go...

30:51.416 --> 30:54.329
...so we all go, we all,
you know, see all the sights...

30:54.553 --> 30:57.432
...and ride the subway,
eat too much pizza, the whole nine.

30:57.589 --> 31:01.765
By about midnight, Sam and Dad
are zonked and I figure, screw it.

31:01.993 --> 31:03.438
I'm going to CBGB.

31:04.596 --> 31:05.939
- CBGB is...
- I know.

31:07.265 --> 31:10.337
That's where the Ramones
and Blondie got their start.

31:11.837 --> 31:16.013
Right. Well, anyways,
he was way underage at the time.

31:16.208 --> 31:21.521
Yeah, so I get there, I
sneak in, and it is nuts.

31:21.713 --> 31:25.456
I mean, people are drinking and they're
smoking, they're snorting whatever.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.688
There's a SOD-pound guy on stage
with a mohawk, just screaming...

31:28.887 --> 31:31.595
...and my mind is blown,
I don't even know what to do.

31:31.790 --> 31:36.102
Then this girl walks up and she's, "Hey, why
don'! you come over and sit down with us?"

31:36.294 --> 31:38.638
- All right.
- They get him drunk for the first time.

31:38.797 --> 31:43.871
But not fun drunk. I'm not quite sure whats
in that stuff, but the room starts to spin.

31:44.102 --> 31:48.050
And I feel like I'm gonna puke forever.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.047
Right about that time...

31:50.609 --> 31:52.316
...I hear him.

31:52.878 --> 31:54.118
"Dean Winchester."

31:56.715 --> 31:58.991
My old man.
I don't know how, but he found me.

32:00.652 --> 32:04.725
And now I'm really freaking out, because he's
just standing there, not saying anything.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.336
Everybody else is freaking out too.
Nobody's even looking him in the eye.

32:08.493 --> 32:13.067
Finally, one guy with a safety pin through his
nose and a "kill everything" tattoo looks up.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.336
And he says, "Sorry, sir."

32:17.502 --> 32:20.449
Yeah. "Sorry, sir." God.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.416
John “Freaking" Winchester.

32:31.850 --> 32:32.851
He saved you.

32:34.152 --> 32:36.029
Yeah, and you know what he got for that?

32:36.188 --> 32:38.759
Me whining about how much
he embarrassed me.

32:39.524 --> 32:41.197
Me telling him that I hated him.

32:42.694 --> 32:46.540
But he turned around,
looked at me and said, "Son...

32:46.865 --> 32:49.368
...you don't like me, that's fine.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.171
It's not my job to be liked."

32:51.369 --> 32:54.213
"It's my job to raise you right."

32:58.310 --> 32:59.983
And he did.

33:06.451 --> 33:09.057
Do you think Claire is in trouble?

33:09.888 --> 33:12.459
She's hanging out with a guy named Randy.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.836
She's in trouble.

33:21.066 --> 33:22.977
Randy?

33:24.069 --> 33:25.070
Hey.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.478
- Evening, little lady.
- Honey?

33:31.576 --> 33:32.919
You have something for me?

33:40.919 --> 33:42.364
No!

33:45.257 --> 33:48.500
Guns blazing, huh? That was your plan?

33:50.028 --> 33:54.101
Trust me, this pile of
crap, he ain't worth it.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.613
Put her in the other room.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.620
She's got fight, I like that.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.789
I married the last girl
that spit in my face.

34:18.889 --> 34:22.132
Last few months,
you've lost a bundle on the ponies.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.474
How much you owe me now?

34:26.898 --> 34:28.138
Five thousand.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.774
So how about I give you a break...

34:32.804 --> 34:35.375
...and you give me the girl?

34:38.643 --> 34:40.589
That's a joke, right?

34:40.812 --> 34:42.291
Claire's like family to me.

34:42.813 --> 34:45.158
Please, I know the con, all right?

34:45.382 --> 34:48.795
You find some kid with daddy issues,
then you get her to steal for you.

34:48.987 --> 34:50.489
Cut the proud papa act.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.157
I'll make you a good deal.

34:59.497 --> 35:03.001
Like I said, Claire is family.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.010
So it better be a damn good deal.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.801
Stop.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.441
I know who's been smuggling souls up
from hell.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.107
Really?

35:40.305 --> 35:41.784
Pray do tell.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.484
- Him.
- What?

35:47.445 --> 35:49.982
It's true, Mister... My Lord.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.684
Gerald, he... We made a deal.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.395
- She's lying.
- Why? Why would she lie?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.406
That's enough of that, Gerald.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.735
I'll kill you, bitch.

36:09.034 --> 36:10.911
That's enough, Gerald.

36:11.069 --> 36:12.844
Come on.

36:13.238 --> 36:15.184
Come on.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.685
I said, that's enough, Gerald.

36:24.215 --> 36:25.353
Thank you.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.065
Coming?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.542
Rowena.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.511
You said that if I lied,
you'd get me out of here.

36:50.341 --> 36:54.585
Oh, and I will, darling.
I'll be back in a flash.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.405
Hi.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.420
It's Claire, right?

37:50.635 --> 37:53.013
You really are a pretty one, you know that?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.515
- Come here!
- Aah!

38:06.251 --> 38:09.164
- Don't.
- Back it up.

38:10.588 --> 38:11.931
Where's the girl?

38:25.603 --> 38:27.048
Claire.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.047
Claire. Claire.

38:44.722 --> 38:45.894
Randy?

38:48.126 --> 38:49.161
Get her out of here.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.971
Go. Go.

38:52.797 --> 38:53.867
Go.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.310
Hey, back up. Back up!

38:58.570 --> 39:00.015
Don't be as dumb as you look.

39:00.738 --> 39:01.910
Hey!

39:18.990 --> 39:21.903
You guys don't wanna do this.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.713
Are you okay?

39:42.580 --> 39:44.184
Yeah.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.630
Dean.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.262
Dean. Hey.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.404
Tell me you had to do this.

40:32.497 --> 40:35.239
- I didn't... I didn't mean to.
- No.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.175
Tell me it was them or you.
