WEBVTT

00:06.927 --> 00:07.928
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:07.928 --> 00:09.050
( groaning )

00:12.133 --> 00:14.185
HE'S BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
IT'S VIKRAM.

00:14.185 --> 00:15.186
I'M SORRY, BUT HE'S DEAD.

00:15.186 --> 00:16.187
A CAR CRASH?

00:16.187 --> 00:17.308
SOMEONE MOVED HIS BODY,

00:17.308 --> 00:18.519
PUT IT IN THAT CAR--

00:18.519 --> 00:20.141
I MEAN, IS SOMEONE
TRYING TO PROTECT US?

00:20.141 --> 00:21.642
I THINK YOU SHOULD
ASK HER TO HOMECOMING.

00:21.642 --> 00:22.853
WHO, ANDIE?

00:22.853 --> 00:24.445
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST
NIGHTS OF MY LIFE.

00:24.445 --> 00:25.986
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE
OF THE GREATEST NIGHTS
OF MY LIFE TOO.

00:25.986 --> 00:28.149
YOUR FATHER HAD
A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

00:28.149 --> 00:29.360
FOR $10 MILLION.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.652
HE SET UP A TRUST
IN DANIEL'S NAME.

00:31.652 --> 00:33.074
YOUR FATHER
LEFT THE MONEY TO YOU.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.535
I KNOW WHO MOVED
THE BODY.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.576
IT WAS MY MOM.

00:35.576 --> 00:37.998
WE COULD GO SKIP STONES
ON THE HUDSON.

00:37.998 --> 00:39.710
LIVE A LITTLE.

00:40.961 --> 00:43.294
BEFORE JO,
I HAD ANOTHER BABY.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.126
VIKRAM FOUND A FAMILY
TO ADOPT.

00:45.126 --> 00:47.007
- WHERE IS THIS CHILD?
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:47.007 --> 00:48.169
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE MORE
TORTURED THAN EVER.

00:48.169 --> 00:49.170
I'M FINE, LACEY.

00:49.170 --> 00:50.511
YOU NEED TO TELL SOMEONE.

00:50.511 --> 00:51.592
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DO.

00:51.592 --> 00:54.385
YOU KNOW.
YOU KNOW I KILLED DAD.

00:57.308 --> 00:59.520
YOU TOOK THE BLAME
FOR HIM.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.982
FOR TARA'S MURDER.

01:01.982 --> 01:04.565
ALL THOSE YEARS.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.687
WHEN I HEARD
HE WAS ALIVE,

01:06.687 --> 01:08.109
I JUST-- I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO HIM.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.281
CONFRONT HIM...

01:10.281 --> 01:12.153
BUT WHAT HE
PUT ME THROUGH--

01:12.153 --> 01:14.575
YOU HAD HIM COME
TO THAT CHURCH.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.827
AND THEN HE ATTACKED JO.

01:18.409 --> 01:20.791
SOMEBODY-- SOMEBODY
MUST HAVE MOVED THE BODY.

01:20.791 --> 01:22.042
STAGED THAT CAR CRASH

01:22.042 --> 01:23.584
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.296
AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS
SOMEBODY TRYING TO PROTECT US,

01:25.296 --> 01:26.507
BUT IF IT'S NOT YOU,

01:26.507 --> 01:28.008
MOM, THEN SOMEBODY KNOWS.

01:28.008 --> 01:30.050
KYLE CLOSED THE CASE.

01:30.050 --> 01:31.302
HE CONCLUDED
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

01:31.302 --> 01:32.923
AND YOU AND JO
ARE IN THE CLEAR.

01:32.923 --> 01:34.555
AND THAT PERSON,
THEY HAVEN'T COME FORWARD.

01:34.555 --> 01:36.016
THEY HAVEN'T ASKED
FOR ANYTHING.

01:36.016 --> 01:38.018
THAT'S WHAT MADE US THINK
THAT IT MIGHT BE YOU.

01:38.018 --> 01:39.180
MAYBE WITH JACK'S HELP.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.772
JACK...

01:41.772 --> 01:43.394
OH, MY GOD.

01:43.394 --> 01:44.935
WHY WOULD HE
DO THAT FOR ME?

01:44.935 --> 01:47.358
HE WOULD DO IT FOR ME.

01:48.899 --> 01:51.111
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN,
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT MYSELF.

01:55.075 --> 01:58.409
I-- I KILLED HIM, MOM.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.740
I KILLED--

01:59.740 --> 02:01.792
STOP IT!

02:01.792 --> 02:04.875
HE WENT AFTER YOU.
AFTER JO.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.917
AND HE SENT YOU TO JUVIE.

02:06.917 --> 02:09.750
I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD,
AND YOU SHOULD BE TOO.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.922
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
A NIGHTMARE, AND I JUST--

02:11.922 --> 02:13.714
I JUST CAN'T WAKE UP.

02:13.714 --> 02:14.885
WELL, IT ENDS NOW.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.927
JACK DID US A HUGE FAVOR.

02:16.927 --> 02:18.889
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE
IT'S JACK?

02:18.889 --> 02:22.022
TRUST ME. I'M SURE.

02:22.022 --> 02:24.475
I WILL DEAL WITH IT.

02:24.475 --> 02:26.267
THIS NIGHTMARE'S
FINALLY OVER.

02:26.267 --> 02:27.898
AND YOU'RE FREE.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.485
( chuckling )

02:35.776 --> 02:37.538
YOU SKIP A MEAN STONE,
MASTERSON.

02:37.538 --> 02:39.950
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT
SINCE I WAS LITTLE.

02:39.950 --> 02:41.622
STILL GOT IT.

02:41.622 --> 02:42.993
( chuckles )

02:42.993 --> 02:46.166
SO... WHAT OTHER SKILLS
HAVE YOU BEEN KEEPING SECRET?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.958
WAIT, DON'T TELL ME.

02:47.958 --> 02:50.090
YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY

02:50.090 --> 02:52.553
TO BECOMING A BRILLIANT
TRAPEZE ARTIST,

02:52.553 --> 02:54.094
BUT LIFE GOT IN THE WAY.

02:54.094 --> 02:56.096
( laughs )
UH...

02:56.096 --> 02:59.680
NO, UM, I REALLY DON'T
LIKE HEIGHTS, ACTUALLY.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.472
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

03:01.472 --> 03:03.474
COME ON.
I WANT TO KNOW.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.226
I DON'T KNOW.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.519
THERE'S-- THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING TOO EXOTIC HERE.

03:08.519 --> 03:10.401
IT'S JUST JO.

03:10.401 --> 03:12.022
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

03:12.022 --> 03:13.944
NIGHT, JUST JO.

03:15.906 --> 03:16.907
( chuckles )

03:22.953 --> 03:25.326
( slight rattle )

03:25.326 --> 03:26.957
HEY.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.879
WHAT'S WRONG?

03:28.879 --> 03:33.003
JO, I TOLD MY MOM WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE RAVINE.

03:33.003 --> 03:34.635
YOU DID WHAT?

03:34.635 --> 03:36.297
I WAS POSITIVE
THAT IT WAS HER

03:36.297 --> 03:38.048
THAT MOVED THE BODY,
BUT IT'S NOT.

03:38.048 --> 03:39.640
WAIT, DANNY...

03:39.640 --> 03:40.931
IT'S OKAY.

03:40.931 --> 03:42.263
SHE'S ON OUR SIDE.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.975
AND-- AND SHE'S SURE
IT'S JACK.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.727
SHE THINKS
THAT HE HELPED US

03:46.727 --> 03:48.228
BECAUSE HE
HAS FEELINGS FOR HER.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.022
SO... SO HE WON'T SAY
ANYTHING, RIGHT?

03:52.022 --> 03:53.904
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

03:55.946 --> 03:59.320
LOOK, I--
I BELIEVE MY MOM.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.282
( sighs )
I THINK IT'S OVER.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.864
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOPE SO.

04:03.864 --> 04:06.076
YEAH, ME TOO.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.292
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN THINKING.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.713
UH...

04:16.046 --> 04:18.299
THIS SECRET,
THIS WHOLE THING

04:18.299 --> 04:22.052
HAS REALLY JUST...
TAKEN OVER MY LIFE.

04:22.052 --> 04:24.645
AND IF IT'S OVER,

04:24.645 --> 04:27.558
I-- I REALLY WANT
TO GET BACK ON TRACK.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.149
RIGHT. I AGREE.

04:29.149 --> 04:30.891
WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MOVE ON.

04:30.891 --> 04:32.893
YEAH.

04:35.736 --> 04:38.068
UM...

04:38.068 --> 04:39.450
WHAT IS IT?

04:39.450 --> 04:42.493
I THINK I JUST...

04:42.493 --> 04:45.285
NEED TO FIGURE SOME STUFF
OUT ON MY OWN.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.077
FIGURE OUT
WHO I AM WITH--

04:47.077 --> 04:50.040
WITHOUT...

04:53.043 --> 04:54.294
ME?

05:04.094 --> 05:06.927
( theme music playing )

05:13.313 --> 05:15.896
DID YOU TALK TO JO?

05:15.896 --> 05:17.898
UH, YES.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.533
SHE SEEMED VERY HAPPY
ABOUT IT.

05:22.533 --> 05:24.905
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

05:24.905 --> 05:28.038
THE LAST THING
WE NEED IS HER RUNNING
TO HER MOM AND DAD.

05:28.038 --> 05:30.581
SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.833
I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.915
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.459
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT JACK?

05:41.051 --> 05:44.224
FIND A WAY TO BRING IT UP
WITHOUT BRINGING IT UP.

05:44.224 --> 05:47.227
I'M ASSUMING HE HAD
A REASON FOR NOT TELLING.

05:47.227 --> 05:51.181
PROBABLY TO KEEP US
BLAMELESS IF ANYONE FOUND OUT.

05:54.815 --> 05:58.068
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON
SETTLING BACK INTO SCHOOL.

05:58.068 --> 05:59.860
- AND LACEY--
- LACEY?

05:59.860 --> 06:02.403
( scoffs )

06:02.403 --> 06:05.536
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO--
LIE TO HER FACE?

06:05.536 --> 06:07.197
WELL, IT'S NOT LYING.

06:07.197 --> 06:08.749
IT'S WITHHOLDING THE TRUTH.

06:08.749 --> 06:11.251
JUST LIKE JACK'S DOING.

06:11.251 --> 06:14.084
AND IT'S FOR HER OWN GOOD.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.052
I JUST WANT TO START
ON A NEW TRACK.

06:22.052 --> 06:25.676
GOOD, GOOD. LET'S START
BUILDING THAT TRACK.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.849
OH, WELL-- YOU'RE SMART.

06:28.849 --> 06:30.270
YOU'VE GOT EXCELLENT GRADES.

06:30.270 --> 06:33.103
BUT THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SHOW
FOR MY HIGH-SCHOOL CAREER.

06:33.103 --> 06:36.106
YOU SHOULD CERTAINLY
BE PROUD OF YOUR GPA.

06:36.106 --> 06:39.109
BUT COLLEGES ARE LOOKING
FOR SELF-STARTERS.

06:39.109 --> 06:40.781
WELL, I'M HERE.

06:40.781 --> 06:42.402
ISN'T THAT A START?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.946
YES, IT IS.
GOOD POINT. BRAVO, JO.

06:45.946 --> 06:47.988
WELL, I COULD JOIN A CLUB.

06:47.988 --> 06:50.080
MY FRIEND RICO
WAS IN THE MATHLETES.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.082
OR I COULD TRY THEATER AGAIN.

06:52.082 --> 06:54.455
I DID A-- I DID A SOBRIETY
AWARENESS SKIT ONCE WHEN I WAS--

06:54.455 --> 06:56.587
AH, TO BE BLUNT,

06:56.587 --> 06:59.880
IT'S TOO LITTLE TOO LATE,
I'M AFRAID.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.132
IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE A LAST-MINUTE JOINER.

07:02.132 --> 07:05.095
SEE, COLLEGES--
THEY WANT TO SEE PASSION.

07:05.095 --> 07:07.508
THEY WANT LEADERS.

07:07.508 --> 07:08.679
LEADERS.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.351
YES, EXACTLY.

07:11.351 --> 07:15.976
YOU ARE HIDING YOUR LIGHT
UNDER A BUSHEL, JO.

07:15.976 --> 07:19.860
YOU-- YOU HAVE
TO LET IT SHINE.

07:21.772 --> 07:24.234
STARTING NOW.

07:24.234 --> 07:25.566
NEXT!

07:25.566 --> 07:27.908
LIZZY, COME ON IN.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.833
SO I COMPLETED COMMUNITY
SERVICE THIS WEEKEND.

07:32.833 --> 07:35.996
AND I ORGANIZED A PEP ASSEMBLY
THE DAY AFTER REGIONALS.

07:35.996 --> 07:38.378
I LIKE TOTALLY
SHED MY BUSHEL.

07:41.041 --> 07:42.883
DUDES, IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE PLATFORM.

07:42.883 --> 07:44.545
AND MINE'S PIZZA.

07:44.545 --> 07:45.926
YOU LOVE IT.
I LOVE IT.

07:45.926 --> 07:48.509
SO LET'S DO IT.
STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.512
THAT GUY
IS A TOTAL JOKE.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.764
RIGHT? THIS SCHOOL
HAS LIKE LEGIT ISSUES.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.766
AND PIZZA MAKES ME
BREAK OUT.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.775
HELLO?

08:06.817 --> 08:08.569
JACK?

08:10.280 --> 08:11.572
CAN I HELP YOU?

08:11.572 --> 08:12.913
UH...

08:12.913 --> 08:15.956
I WAS, UH,
JUST LOOKING FOR JACK.

08:15.956 --> 08:18.378
I DIDN'T REALIZE HE HAD...

08:18.378 --> 08:19.710
UM, WELL, COMPANY.

08:19.710 --> 08:23.043
YOU'RE WAY HOTTER THAN
HIS USUAL CUSTOMERS.

08:23.043 --> 08:25.215
WHITNEY?

08:25.215 --> 08:26.967
HI, KAREN.

08:26.967 --> 08:29.630
WOW, YOU'VE--
YOU'VE GROWN.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.932
YEAH. MIRACLE OF BOOBS.

08:31.932 --> 08:34.805
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

08:34.805 --> 08:36.637
KAREN. HI.

08:36.637 --> 08:37.638
HI.

08:37.638 --> 08:39.600
( both stammer )

08:39.600 --> 08:42.983
SO, DAD, IS KAREN
GOING TO BE MY NEW MOM?

08:42.983 --> 08:45.405
WHITNEY-- PLEASE, BABE.

08:45.405 --> 08:46.947
SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING OVER.

08:46.947 --> 08:48.528
NO, I'M SORRY.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.150
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD
YOUR DAUGHTER VISITING YOU.

08:50.150 --> 08:51.742
( chuckles )

08:51.742 --> 08:53.654
YEAH, IT WAS A SURPRISE
TO ME TOO.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.079
WOW, STUDENT BODY
PRESIDENT.

08:59.079 --> 09:00.711
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN BABY STEPS, DO YOU?

09:00.711 --> 09:02.042
( sighs )

09:02.042 --> 09:05.085
WAIT, AREN'T
THE ELECTION SPEECHES LIKE...

09:05.085 --> 09:06.466
TOMORROW?

09:06.466 --> 09:09.169
YEAH, BUT THERE'S NO RULE
AGAINST SIGNING UP LATE.

09:09.169 --> 09:12.593
I JUST-- I JUST REALLY WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.094
- BUT...
- YEAH, I THINK THAT--

09:14.094 --> 09:15.265
YOU THINK
IT'S TOO MUCH, RIGHT?

09:15.265 --> 09:16.977
YEAH, I MEAN, WHO WOULD
EVEN VOTE FOR ME?

09:16.977 --> 09:18.098
JO, STOP.

09:18.098 --> 09:19.890
I THINK IT'S AWESOME.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.852
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.895
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

09:24.895 --> 09:27.027
STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT.
ALL RIGHT.

09:27.027 --> 09:28.819
I KNOW.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

09:28.819 --> 09:30.951
WHAT? WAIT,
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

09:30.951 --> 09:32.613
THAT I'M RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT?

09:32.613 --> 09:34.284
DUH, HER POSTERS
ARE ALL OVER SCHOOL.

09:34.284 --> 09:35.956
HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER
IS KILLING IT.

09:35.956 --> 09:37.197
THIS GUY.

09:37.197 --> 09:38.248
( both laugh )

09:38.248 --> 09:40.120
OH. YEAH, I GUESS
I JUST...

09:40.120 --> 09:41.792
HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING
ATTENTION.

09:41.792 --> 09:43.463
JO'S ACTUALLY
RUNNING TOO.

09:43.463 --> 09:44.584
( laughs )

09:44.584 --> 09:47.087
THAT'S FUNNY.

09:48.258 --> 09:49.800
WHAT?

09:49.800 --> 09:52.052
YEAH, I JUST...
I KIND OF JUST SIGNED UP.

09:52.052 --> 09:54.885
I JUST WANTED
TO PARTICIPATE, YOU KNOW.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.017
BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT YOU WERE-- BECAUSE--

09:57.017 --> 09:59.389
- I WOULDN'T HAVE--
- ( stammers) NO.

09:59.389 --> 10:03.063
JO, THAT'S... THE SPIRIT
OF DEMOCRACY, RIGHT?

10:03.063 --> 10:04.935
YOU'D BE SO GOOD.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.817
MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.

10:06.817 --> 10:08.228
OKAY.

10:08.228 --> 10:09.730
GREAT.

10:09.730 --> 10:11.361
OKAY.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.904
WE SHOULD GO PLAN
CAMPAIGN STRATEGY.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.736
- ALL RIGHT.
- FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS--

10:15.736 --> 10:17.077
DO WE GET YOU

10:17.077 --> 10:18.288
A SNAPPY PANTSUIT?

10:18.288 --> 10:19.870
OBVIOUSLY.

10:28.458 --> 10:29.880
SO, UM...

10:29.880 --> 10:34.214
I AM TOTALLY SCREWED
FOR THIS HISTORY TEST.

10:34.214 --> 10:36.677
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND YOU ALL DAY

10:36.677 --> 10:39.099
- FOR A STUDY SESSION, BUT--
- I'VE BEEN AVOIDING YOU?

10:39.099 --> 10:41.471
SO I WASN'T JUST
IMAGINING THAT, HUH?

10:41.471 --> 10:43.063
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU

10:43.063 --> 10:45.435
UNTIL YOU START BEING
HONEST WITH ME.

10:45.435 --> 10:47.938
I KNOW SOMETHING HAPPENED.
I KNOW I'M NOT WRONG
ABOUT THIS.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.980
HEY-- OKAY, OKAY.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.531
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN.

10:51.531 --> 10:53.323
UM...

10:53.323 --> 10:55.035
I SAW MY DAD.

10:55.035 --> 10:56.616
WHAT? WHEN?

10:56.616 --> 10:58.909
THE NIGHT
THAT I RAN AWAY.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.832
I SAW HIM, AND
I TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM
TO TURN HIMSELF IN.

11:01.832 --> 11:03.203
AND THEN WE FOUGHT, AND--

11:03.203 --> 11:05.956
HE GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.088
YEAH, I JUST--
I JUST WISH THINGS

11:08.088 --> 11:09.249
HAD TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY.

11:09.249 --> 11:11.591
BECAUSE IF YOU
HAD TURNED HIM IN,

11:11.591 --> 11:13.253
MAYBE HE'D STILL BE ALIVE?

11:15.005 --> 11:16.596
YEAH, MAYBE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

11:16.596 --> 11:18.098
DANNY, NO, YOU CAN'T
THINK LIKE THAT.

11:18.098 --> 11:19.509
YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

11:19.509 --> 11:22.062
I JUST-- I MESSED UP.
I ALWAYS MESS EVERYTHING UP.

11:22.062 --> 11:24.434
AND I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

11:24.434 --> 11:28.358
DANNY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
ALONE IN THIS, OKAY?

11:30.020 --> 11:32.482
DOES, UM--
DOES JO KNOW?

11:32.482 --> 11:37.197
NO. NO, AND I DON'T
WANT HER TO, OKAY?

11:37.197 --> 11:40.200
I'M JUST TIRED
OF BURDENING PEOPLE
WITH MY PROBLEMS.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.413
DANNY, WHAT?
IT'S NOT A BURDEN.

11:43.413 --> 11:46.126
( sighs )
GOD, I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

11:47.918 --> 11:50.330
I'M SO HAPPY YOU FINALLY
TOLD ME THE TRUTH.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.102
I WANT TO STAY HERE.

12:02.102 --> 12:03.553
YOU GOT KICKED OUT
OF BOARDING SCHOOL AGAIN.

12:03.553 --> 12:04.895
DAD, PLEASE!

12:04.895 --> 12:07.107
I KNOW I MESSED UP.
I'M SORRY.

12:07.107 --> 12:08.478
I WANT TO STAY HERE.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.230
YOUR MOTHER
HAS CUSTODY, WHITNEY.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.612
YOU CAN STAY HERE UNTIL
SHE GETS BACK FROM EUROPE.

12:12.612 --> 12:14.194
THEN BACK TO THE CITY.

12:14.194 --> 12:15.986
I ONLY HAVE THE OUTFIT
I CAME HERE IN.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.567
AND IT'S TOTALLY GROSS
BY NOW.

12:17.567 --> 12:19.449
I WILL TAKE YOU SHOPPING
TO THE FASHION FARM
TOMORROW.

12:19.449 --> 12:22.492
FARM? ARE YOU S--
YOU CAN'T.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.415
KAREN, HELP.

12:25.415 --> 12:27.367
I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF ANYTHING.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.369
FASHION FARM.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.372
WELL, MY SON LOVES
TO REMIND ME

12:32.372 --> 12:34.294
THAT I HAVE MORE CLOTHES
THAN ONE WOMAN

12:34.294 --> 12:35.966
COULD POSSIBLY EVER WEAR,
SO...

12:35.966 --> 12:37.757
KAREN. YES.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.970
OKAY?

12:39.970 --> 12:41.511
THANK YOU.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.513
PLEASE, IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.766
YOU PROBABLY
CAME BY FOR A REASON.

12:51.691 --> 12:54.815
UH... IT CAN WAIT.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.606
COFFEE'S BREWING, SO...

12:56.606 --> 12:58.608
WE'LL TALK LATER.

12:59.699 --> 13:01.401
IF "TALK"
IS A CODE WORD,

13:01.401 --> 13:03.243
IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD ONE.

13:03.243 --> 13:05.826
AND I DON'T DO HOME BREW.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.577
( sighs )

13:16.296 --> 13:20.300
KYLE, I JUST REALLY
FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THIS.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.133
YOU HAD YEARS TO TALK,

13:23.133 --> 13:25.515
BUT INSTEAD YOU JUST PRETENDED
IT NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.

13:25.515 --> 13:28.308
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT CHILD EVERY DAY.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.980
HOW SHE GREW UP,
WHAT SHE BECAME.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.391
BUT YOU NEVER TALKED
TO ME ABOUT IT.

13:31.391 --> 13:32.983
YOU JUST KEPT IT
TO YOURSELF.

13:32.983 --> 13:35.145
I KNOW.
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG.

13:35.145 --> 13:37.147
I JUST--

13:37.147 --> 13:38.698
WHAT, TESS?
JUST SAY IT.

13:38.698 --> 13:41.281
I WANTED YOU TO HAVE
THE PERFECT FAMILY.

13:41.281 --> 13:42.322
PERFECT?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.284
THAT IS THE LAST
THING WE ARE.

13:44.284 --> 13:46.706
YEAH, SO I HAVE A LOT OF
IDEAS ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN SPEECH.

13:46.706 --> 13:49.709
I THINK WE CAN
REALLY LAY OUT--

13:49.709 --> 13:52.502
HEY, HONEY.

13:52.502 --> 13:53.914
HI, I'M JO'S MOM.

13:53.914 --> 13:57.127
HI. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
MRS. MASTERSON,

13:57.127 --> 13:59.129
MR. MASTERSON.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.631
CHIEF. SIR.

14:01.631 --> 14:03.513
UH, I-- I'M CHARLIE.

14:03.513 --> 14:04.925
NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.770
YOU'RE WELCOME TO
STAY FOR DINNER,
CHARLIE.

14:10.770 --> 14:13.353
OH, THANK YOU,
BUT I ACTUALLY
HAVE TO WORK LATER.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.774
OH, OKAY.

14:16.396 --> 14:17.978
COME ON.
LET'S GO UP TO MY ROOM.

14:22.983 --> 14:26.366
WHAT IS SHE THINKING?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.038
JO'S NEVER BEEN INTERESTED
IN STUDENT GOVERNMENT

14:28.038 --> 14:29.789
OR ACTIVITIES IN GENERAL.

14:29.789 --> 14:31.331
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE
THIS IS COMING FROM.

14:31.331 --> 14:34.124
SHE HAS A RIGHT
TO RUN, RICO.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.126
IT'S JUST...

14:36.126 --> 14:38.708
I'M NOT SURE IF
I STILL SHOULD.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.300
ANDIE, YOU'RE THE SMARTEST,

14:40.300 --> 14:43.713
NICEST, MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY
CONSCIOUS GIRL I'VE EVER MET.

14:43.713 --> 14:47.557
AND YOU'RE TOTALLY HOT.
I MEAN, YOU COULD WIN ON
INTELLECT ALONE--

14:47.557 --> 14:49.389
EVEN IF YOU HAD LIKE
A PAPER BAG OVER YOUR HEAD.

14:49.389 --> 14:53.143
THAT MAY BE THE ONLY WAY
I GET THROUGH THIS SPEECH.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.316
I'M SO NERVOUS ABOUT IT.

14:56.316 --> 14:59.729
HEY, MAYBE YOU COULD
WRITE SOME JOKES FOR ME?

14:59.729 --> 15:01.231
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.193
WELL, I HAVE BEEN
TOLD THAT BEFORE.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.234
THANKS, RICO.

15:06.236 --> 15:07.407
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.492
SO, STUDLY,
ANOTHER GIRL?

15:12.492 --> 15:14.704
THE GIRL.
MY GIRLFRIEND, ANDIE.

15:14.704 --> 15:18.128
SHE THINKS I'M REALLY FUNNY,
SO SHE WANTS ME TO WRITE
HER SPEECH FOR HER.

15:18.128 --> 15:20.130
SO KEEP THE JAVA FLOWING.

15:20.130 --> 15:21.501
FRESHEN UP HILLARY'S TOO?

15:21.501 --> 15:23.133
OH, HER NAME'S--

15:23.133 --> 15:25.925
OH. ( laughs )
THAT'S GOOD.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.098
USE IT.
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

15:28.098 --> 15:29.599
OKAY.

15:32.312 --> 15:35.145
I CAN'T JUST RUN
ON ANTI-PIZZA.

15:35.145 --> 15:37.477
I MEAN,
I ACTUALLY LIKE PIZZA.

15:37.477 --> 15:39.319
WHO DOESN'T LIKE PIZZA?

15:39.319 --> 15:41.321
THE GUY MIGHT BE
A GENIUS.

15:41.321 --> 15:42.983
NO, NO.
I HAVE CHEM WITH THAT DUDE.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.565
TRUST ME,
HE'S NOT A GENIUS.

15:45.565 --> 15:46.736
LET'S JUST WORK ON
THE SPEECH.

15:46.736 --> 15:48.328
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS,
RIGHT?

15:48.328 --> 15:50.120
OKAY.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.701
I MEAN, NO ONE REALLY
DECIDES WHO TO VOTE FOR

15:51.701 --> 15:53.123
UNTIL THE ASSEMBLY ANYWAY.

15:54.204 --> 15:57.577
WELL, THEN GOOD THING
THAT YOU ARE SMART,

15:57.577 --> 16:00.290
EXTREMELY LIKEABLE,

16:00.290 --> 16:03.043
AND YOU HAVE
A KILLER SMILE.

16:03.043 --> 16:04.504
( chuckles )

16:04.504 --> 16:06.136
( both chuckle )

16:06.136 --> 16:07.297
OKAY.

16:07.297 --> 16:10.010
SORRY, COMPLIMENTS
MAKE ME REALLY WEIRD.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.302
UM...

16:12.302 --> 16:16.306
LET'S JUST FINISH THIS
BEFORE YOU HAVE TO
START YOUR SHIFT, OKAY?

16:16.306 --> 16:17.767
YEAH.

16:17.767 --> 16:20.980
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY NICE
OF YOUR MOM TO INVITE ME
TO STAY.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.312
SORRY THAT I HAVE TO
GO TO WORK.

16:22.312 --> 16:25.315
AND MISS OUT ON
A SUPER AWKWARD DINNER?

16:25.315 --> 16:27.407
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
FIGHTING.

16:27.407 --> 16:29.159
I MEAN, I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

16:29.159 --> 16:30.490
I'M TIRED OF EVEN
THINKING ABOUT IT.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.283
LET'S JUST--

16:33.283 --> 16:34.874
CAN WE JUST WORK
ON THE CAMPAIGN?

16:34.874 --> 16:36.706
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
KHALEESI.

16:37.787 --> 16:39.459
'KAY.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.507
WORKING HARD, CHAMP?

16:49.469 --> 16:50.930
ARE YOU SURPRISED
TO SEE ME?

16:52.222 --> 16:54.304
( chuckles )
YOU MUST BE,

16:54.304 --> 16:56.136
CONSIDERING YOU KILLED ME.

17:02.142 --> 17:04.194
NOT QUITE SO EASY TO GET
RID OF ME THOUGH, IS IT?

17:04.194 --> 17:05.405
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:05.405 --> 17:06.986
IT'S MY HOUSE, DANNY.

17:09.149 --> 17:11.321
I SEE YOU'RE PRETENDING
THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE,

17:11.321 --> 17:13.413
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

17:13.413 --> 17:16.326
YOU'LL NEVER BE FINE.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.708
YOU CAN MAKE IT
EASIER THOUGH.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.660
YOU HAVE A TICKET OUT.

17:20.660 --> 17:25.755
$10 MILLION.

17:27.167 --> 17:29.719
YOU SEE, I KNOW...

17:29.719 --> 17:31.721
FROM EXPERIENCE

17:31.721 --> 17:34.134
THAT MONEY CAN

17:34.134 --> 17:36.556
BUY HAPPINESS.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.139
BETTER YET,

17:39.139 --> 17:41.811
IT CAN HELP TO KEEP
THE DEMONS AT BAY.

17:41.811 --> 17:42.812
BOO.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.144
( gasps )

17:53.493 --> 17:55.495
THIS IS SO SCHOOL
SPIRIT-Y OF YOU.

17:55.495 --> 17:57.577
YOU GONNA JOIN
THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD NEXT?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.909
RAH-RAH.
JUST VOTE FOR ME, OKAY?

17:59.909 --> 18:01.501
WHY ARE YOU HERE
SO EARLY ANYWAY?

18:01.501 --> 18:05.915
UM, WELL, I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE STUDYING FOR
A HUGE HISTORY TEST,

18:05.915 --> 18:07.917
BUT I CAN'T--
CAN'T FOCUS.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.629
I KEEP
THINKING ABOUT...

18:11.511 --> 18:12.922
WHAT?

18:12.922 --> 18:14.514
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM,

18:14.514 --> 18:17.517
AND I FEEL LIKE HE'S
BEING WAY TOO HARD ON
HIMSELF.

18:17.517 --> 18:18.848
DANNY?

18:20.930 --> 18:23.723
JO... ( sighs )

18:25.935 --> 18:27.527
HE TOLD ME THAT
HE SAW HIS DAD

18:27.527 --> 18:28.528
BEFORE HE DIED.

18:28.528 --> 18:31.531
AND THEY GOT
INTO SOME FIGHT.

18:31.531 --> 18:34.364
ANYWAY, HE THINKS
THAT HE'S TO BLAME FOR--

18:34.364 --> 18:36.536
FOR HIS DAD GETTING
IN THAT CAR ACCIDENT.

18:38.077 --> 18:39.118
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.661
YEAH.

18:41.661 --> 18:44.664
UM, JO, I THINK THAT
THERE'S A LOT MORE

18:44.664 --> 18:46.506
THAT HE'S NOT TELLING ME.

18:46.506 --> 18:49.839
YEAH, WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
THE SAME OLD DANNY TO ME.

18:51.751 --> 18:54.254
I'M SORRY, I JUST--
I CAN'T.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.717
I HAVE TOO MUCH
ON MY PLATE.

18:57.717 --> 18:59.719
I HAVE TO GO.

19:05.525 --> 19:07.527
KAREN,
YOU'RE SAVING MY LIFE.

19:07.527 --> 19:09.108
MY DAD'S NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING,

19:09.108 --> 19:11.030
EXCEPT MAYBE
MALLS AND SHOPPING.

19:11.030 --> 19:13.573
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER YOU
SPENT A LOT OF TIME HERE

19:13.573 --> 19:14.864
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER
WITH YOUR DAD.

19:14.864 --> 19:17.487
MOST SUMMERS.
I LOVED IT.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.659
GETTING TO HANG OUT
WITH HIM ON HIS BOATS.

19:19.659 --> 19:23.663
HE JUST MADE ME FEEL
SO SAFE, YOU KNOW?

19:23.663 --> 19:24.834
YEAH.

19:24.834 --> 19:28.087
HE'S THAT KIND OF GUY,
ISN'T HE?

19:32.502 --> 19:34.504
WHICH IS WHY...

19:34.504 --> 19:37.507
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD
SAY ANYTHING TO HIM.

19:37.507 --> 19:39.679
ABOUT WHAT?

19:41.931 --> 19:44.514
MY MOM'S BOYFRIEND...

19:44.514 --> 19:47.937
KIND OF, UM,

19:47.937 --> 19:51.150
CAME ON TO ME
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

19:51.150 --> 19:52.942
WHAT?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.234
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:55.525 --> 19:58.908
HE JUST SAYS THINGS.

19:58.908 --> 20:02.322
WALKS RIGHT INTO MY BEDROOM
WITHOUT KNOCKING.

20:02.322 --> 20:03.583
DID ANYTHING HAPPEN?

20:03.583 --> 20:05.124
NO.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

20:05.124 --> 20:06.536
YOU NEED TO TELL
YOUR FATHER THIS.

20:06.536 --> 20:07.917
I DON'T KNOW.

20:07.917 --> 20:10.039
I MEAN, I'VE ALREADY
CAUSED ENOUGH TROUBLE.

20:10.039 --> 20:11.501
WHITNEY, LISTEN TO ME.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.334
WE NEED TO TELL
YOUR DAD RIGHT NOW.

20:14.334 --> 20:16.336
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
I KNOW HE WILL.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.260
( school bell rings )
Coach Wasserman: PENCILS DOWN.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.601
BRING 'EM UP.

20:21.601 --> 20:23.603
( students muttering )

20:30.940 --> 20:33.483
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO ASK FOR
AN EXTENSION OR SOMETHING?

20:33.483 --> 20:36.356
IT'S TOO LATE.

20:36.356 --> 20:37.697
ON THE PLUS SIDE,

20:37.697 --> 20:39.359
I'M FLUNKING THIS
CLASS ALREADY,

20:39.359 --> 20:40.780
SO NO HARM DONE, RIGHT?

20:40.780 --> 20:42.161
STICK AROUND, DESAI.

20:42.161 --> 20:43.493
OKAY.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.825
UM, I'LL JUST--
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER.

20:45.825 --> 20:47.577
HOW ABOUT WE GO
TO DINNER TONIGHT?

20:47.577 --> 20:48.748
CLEAR OUR HEADS.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.169
OKAY.

20:50.169 --> 20:52.752
UM, YEAH.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.836
Jack: HOW COULD YOU
NOT BELIEVE IT?

20:56.836 --> 20:58.508
WHEN MY DAUGHTER
TELLS ME SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

20:58.508 --> 20:59.929
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I LISTEN.

20:59.929 --> 21:01.931
( crying )

21:01.931 --> 21:04.594
HEY, BRING AN ENTIRE
LAW FIRM DOWN ON ME
FOR ALL I CARE.

21:04.594 --> 21:06.556
WHITNEY STAYS HERE,
AND THAT'S FINAL.

21:08.728 --> 21:11.521
AND IF THAT MAN SO MUCH AS
EVER LOOKS AT MY DAUGHTER AGAIN,

21:11.521 --> 21:13.483
SO HELP ME, I'LL PUT
A BULLET IN HIS HEAD.

21:13.483 --> 21:14.854
( phone beeps )

21:14.854 --> 21:15.945
WHITNEY, COME HERE.

21:15.945 --> 21:17.527
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

21:17.527 --> 21:18.948
THANK YOU, DADDY.

21:18.948 --> 21:20.950
I LOVE YOU.

21:20.950 --> 21:22.161
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

21:22.161 --> 21:23.493
YOU BARELY FILLED
ANYTHING OUT.

21:23.493 --> 21:24.904
YEAH.

21:24.904 --> 21:27.327
I'VE JUST BEEN GOING
THROUGH A LOT RECENTLY.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.998
YOU KNOW I HAVE TO
FLUNK YOU, RIGHT?

21:28.998 --> 21:31.461
WHY CAN'T I JUST DO LIKE
A MAKE-UP TEST OR SOMETHING?

21:31.461 --> 21:32.712
IT DOESN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

21:32.712 --> 21:35.505
UM...

21:35.505 --> 21:38.338
I RECENTLY-- I RECENTLY
CAME INTO A LOT OF MONEY.

21:38.338 --> 21:41.341
LIKE A TRUST FUND
KIND OF THING.

21:41.341 --> 21:44.594
YEAH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR DAD.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.516
HE LOVED SOCCER.

21:46.516 --> 21:48.187
I THINK HE WOULD HAVE
WANTED ME TO USE

21:48.187 --> 21:50.520
SOME OF THAT MONEY ON
NEW EQUIPMENT,

21:50.520 --> 21:54.354
AND NEW UNIFORMS.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.356
I COULD MAKE
A NICE DONATION

21:56.356 --> 21:58.358
IN HIS HONOR.

21:58.358 --> 22:01.280
WHAT DO YOU SAY, COACH?

22:02.362 --> 22:04.243
DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

22:04.243 --> 22:08.327
I'M SAYING THAT MAYBE
YOU SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT THIS TEST.

22:12.502 --> 22:15.084
ALL RIGHT, DESAI.

22:17.507 --> 22:19.839
IF YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT YOUR FATHER
WOULD HAVE WANTED.

22:33.733 --> 22:35.314
I HAVE ONE OF
THE HIGHEST GPAS

22:35.314 --> 22:38.357
IN MY CLASS,
AND I AM...

22:38.357 --> 22:40.690
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH WITH IT.

22:40.690 --> 22:43.443
WHY ARE YOU STILL RUNNING
WHEN YOU KNOW HOW HARD
ANDIE'S WORKED?

22:43.443 --> 22:45.324
SHE SAID IT WAS OKAY.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.366
OF COURSE SHE DID.
BECAUSE SHE'S NICE.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.699
WHAT IS THIS
EVEN ABOUT?

22:49.699 --> 22:51.701
( stammers )

22:51.701 --> 22:53.703
I JUST WANT TO
DO SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW?

22:53.703 --> 22:57.126
SOMETHING OTHER THAN
GETTING GOOD GRADES

22:57.126 --> 22:59.499
AND SITTING ON THE SIDELINES,
AND DEALING WITH--

22:59.499 --> 23:01.421
BUT STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT
IS ANDIE'S DREAM.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.963
I JUST NEED TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME,
OKAY, RICO?

23:03.963 --> 23:05.214
NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

23:05.214 --> 23:06.766
ANDIE'S NOT
DOING IT FOR HER.

23:06.766 --> 23:08.558
ANDIE'S DOING IT
BECAUSE SHE CARES
ABOUT THE OTHER STUDENTS

23:08.558 --> 23:09.719
AND MAKING THEIR
LIVES BETTER.

23:09.719 --> 23:11.811
GIVING BACK.
THAT'S WHAT ANDIE DOES.

23:11.811 --> 23:13.813
WHY CAN'T I DO THAT TOO?

23:13.813 --> 23:15.394
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.395
YOU'RE JUST DOING IT
FOR YOU.

23:24.484 --> 23:27.286
HERE AT GREEN GROVE,
THIS ISN'T A "HALLWAY,"

23:27.286 --> 23:29.118
IT'S A CORRIDOR
OF LEARNING.

23:29.118 --> 23:30.910
YEAH, THAT'S
VERY SCHOLASTIC.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.873
HOW YOU DOING, JACK?

23:33.873 --> 23:34.954
DANNY.

23:34.954 --> 23:36.536
OH, YOU REMEMBER WHITNEY,
RIGHT?

23:36.536 --> 23:37.587
MY LITTLE GIRL.

23:37.587 --> 23:39.128
GOD, I BARELY
RECOGNIZED YOU

23:39.128 --> 23:40.630
WITHOUT THE PIGTAILS.

23:40.630 --> 23:42.462
OH, LITTLE DANNY DESAI.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.043
ARE YOU STILL
AFRAID OF SPIDERS?

23:44.043 --> 23:46.045
- ONLY THE BIG ONES.
- LOOK AT YOU.

23:46.045 --> 23:47.467
ALREADY MAKING FRIENDS.

23:47.467 --> 23:50.309
HEY, UM,
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

23:50.309 --> 23:53.392
LACEY, I WANTED TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO WHITNEY.

23:53.392 --> 23:56.686
SHE'S A BRIGHT,
PROMISING NEW STUDENT.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.558
SO DO YOU MIND
SHOWING HER AROUND?

23:58.558 --> 24:01.731
UM...

24:01.731 --> 24:02.772
SURE.

24:02.772 --> 24:05.364
YOU ARE SO HELPFUL.

24:05.364 --> 24:06.986
UH, MR. TAYLOR,
JUST FOLLOW ME.

24:06.986 --> 24:08.828
WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE
PAPERWORK TO DO.

24:08.828 --> 24:10.199
ABSOLUTELY.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.491
DANNY, KEEP AN EYE
ON MY LITTLE GIRL.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.122
SEE YOU AFTER SCHOOL.

24:13.122 --> 24:14.624
BYE, JACK.

24:14.624 --> 24:15.665
YEAH.

24:15.665 --> 24:17.076
( chuckles )

24:17.076 --> 24:18.337
YOU CALL YOUR DAD
"JACK"?

24:18.337 --> 24:19.919
ONLY IN PUBLIC.

24:19.919 --> 24:21.671
LEAD ON,
MY STUDENT GUIDE.

24:24.293 --> 24:26.345
SEE YOU, DANNY.

24:26.345 --> 24:28.257
Rico: OKAY, JUST FOLLOW
THE SCRIPT. YOU'RE GONNA
DO GREAT, ALL RIGHT?

24:28.257 --> 24:30.720
I EVEN PUT IN A SPACE
FOR LAUGHTER.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.723
IT'S A COMEDY THING.
YOU'LL SEE.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.304
"PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER."

24:35.304 --> 24:36.726
AM I SWEATING?

24:36.726 --> 24:38.147
I DON'T KNOW.

24:38.147 --> 24:39.649
MY MOUTH'S REALLY DRY.

24:39.649 --> 24:41.811
LOOK, JUST IMAGINE
EVERYONE IN THEIR UNDERWEAR.

24:41.811 --> 24:44.483
THAT'S WHAT
THE PROS DO.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.406
OKAY, DON'T DO THAT.
THAT COULD BE HORRIFYING.

24:47.406 --> 24:50.159
DON'T DO THAT.
STICK TO THE SCRIPT.

24:50.159 --> 24:52.111
HEY, JO.

24:52.111 --> 24:54.283
I JUST WANTED TO
WISH YOU LUCK.

24:54.283 --> 24:55.915
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

24:55.915 --> 24:57.496
THANKS. YOU TOO.

25:00.289 --> 25:02.001
I'M GONNA RUN TO
THE LADIES'.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.293
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO BE CONVERSING WITH
THE ENEMY.

25:07.717 --> 25:09.929
HEY.

25:09.929 --> 25:11.681
LISTEN.

25:11.681 --> 25:15.224
I REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE
BEING PUT IN THE POSITION
OF LYING TO LACEY,

25:15.224 --> 25:16.395
OR LYING ON TOP OF
ANOTHER LIE,

25:16.395 --> 25:18.307
OR WHATEVER IT IS
WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

25:18.307 --> 25:20.269
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
I WANTED SPACE FROM YOU.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.731
I'M SORRY.

25:21.731 --> 25:23.522
I WAS IN A CORNER, OKAY?
I HAD TO TELL HER SOMETHING.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.144
OKAY, WHATEVER.

25:25.144 --> 25:26.315
JUST...

25:26.315 --> 25:28.147
NEXT TIME JUST
LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.

25:28.147 --> 25:29.148
JO!

25:31.320 --> 25:33.412
I AM NOT A FLIP-FLOPPER.

25:33.412 --> 25:35.284
MY PLATFORM HAS
ALWAYS BEEN PIZZA,

25:35.284 --> 25:37.326
- Student: YEAH!
- CONTINUES TO BE PIZZA,

25:37.326 --> 25:39.038
AND WILL FOREVER
BE PIZZA.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.621
BECAUSE PIZZA IS AWESOME!

25:41.621 --> 25:43.332
( cheering )

25:51.721 --> 25:54.303
( Rico applauds )

25:59.599 --> 26:03.312
( sighs )
HI.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.736
I'M ANDIE DANG,

26:06.736 --> 26:10.149
AND I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

26:10.149 --> 26:13.402
"DANG, IS THIS ASSEMBLY
ALMOST OVER?"

26:17.657 --> 26:20.539
I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
BECAUSE I HAVE

26:20.539 --> 26:23.002
SO MANY IDEAS TO
IMPROVE GREEN GROVE.

26:23.002 --> 26:25.414
DID YOU KNOW WE CAN
CUT ELECTRICITY COSTS
IN HALF

26:25.414 --> 26:28.047
BY USING ENERGY
EFFICIENT LIGHT BULBS?

26:31.300 --> 26:33.342
NOW THERE'S
A BRIGHT IDEA.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.344
( yawns )

26:37.516 --> 26:39.348
( chuckles nervously )

26:42.021 --> 26:43.562
AND WE CAN DECREASE
SCHOOL WASTE

26:43.562 --> 26:46.726
WITH A FEW TARGETED
RECYCLING PROGRAMS.

26:46.726 --> 26:48.317
EAT LESS,

26:48.317 --> 26:49.729
GO LESS,

26:49.729 --> 26:52.071
FLUSH LESS.

26:52.071 --> 26:54.033
( students muttering )

26:54.033 --> 26:55.114
( whispers )
"FLUSH," I'M TALKING ABOUT POOP.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.326
OKAY, SO... YEAH.

26:57.326 --> 27:00.039
SO ANYWAY,
IN CONCLUSION...

27:02.702 --> 27:05.004
OH MY GOD, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T SAY THAT.

27:05.004 --> 27:06.706
- I CAN'T.
- SAY IT.

27:06.706 --> 27:09.008
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T SAY THAT.

27:09.008 --> 27:12.301
( scattered applause )

27:21.390 --> 27:23.142
( sighs )

27:23.142 --> 27:25.144
HI.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.565
I'M JO MASTERSON,

27:26.565 --> 27:29.148
BUT MOST OF YOU
PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW THAT,

27:29.148 --> 27:33.823
'CAUSE I'VE DEFINITELY
EMBARRASSED MYSELF UP
ON THIS STAGE BEFORE.

27:33.823 --> 27:35.404
( audience chuckles )

27:35.404 --> 27:38.487
SO...

27:47.957 --> 27:50.169
SO I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
ANDIE JUST WENT THROUGH.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.501
AND I ALSO KNOW

27:52.501 --> 27:55.294
THAT SHE DIDN'T GET TO
SAY WHAT SHE REALLY FEELS,

27:55.294 --> 27:58.137
WHICH IS THAT...

27:58.137 --> 28:00.139
SHE HAS A LOT OF
REALLY GREAT IDEAS

28:00.139 --> 28:01.931
ON HOW TO ACTUALLY
IMPROVE OUR SCHOOL.

28:01.931 --> 28:05.474
AND NOT BECAUSE IT'LL
LOOK GOOD

28:05.474 --> 28:08.307
ON HER COLLEGE
APPLICATION, OR...

28:08.307 --> 28:11.570
IT'S BECAUSE SHE
GENUINELY CARES.

28:11.570 --> 28:13.402
SO I'M NOT
THE RIGHT PERSON

28:13.402 --> 28:15.154
TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT.

28:15.154 --> 28:16.235
SHE IS.

28:17.406 --> 28:19.238
SO VOTE FOR ANDIE.

28:19.238 --> 28:22.241
( applause )

28:35.134 --> 28:37.426
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED,
BUT I BOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE
RESTAURANT.

28:37.426 --> 28:39.718
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
BEST BOYFRIEND EVER?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.140
( chuckles )

28:41.140 --> 28:43.102
I ALSO GOT FLOWERS.

28:43.102 --> 28:44.513
YEAH,
THEY'RE REALLY GREAT.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.516
WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:47.516 --> 28:50.309
WASSERMAN POSTED
GRADES FROM THE TEST.

28:50.309 --> 28:52.311
UH, CHECK YOURS.

28:52.311 --> 28:55.314
THE EXACT THING
I WANTED TO GET
OUR MINDS OFF.

28:55.314 --> 28:58.617
WAITER, WE'D LIKE TO ORDER
THE BELUGA CAVIAR

28:58.617 --> 29:01.320
AND THE BLUE POINT
OYSTERS PLEASE.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.282
RIGHT AWAY.

29:03.282 --> 29:06.285
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
IF I'M GONNA LIKE
EITHER OF THOSE THINGS,

29:06.285 --> 29:07.536
BUT THEY SOUND
RICH AND FANCY--

29:07.536 --> 29:09.708
A "B."
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.750
THAT TEST
WAS A BEAST.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.751
WHAT'D YOU GET?

29:15.674 --> 29:17.676
I SAW YOU TALKING
TO MR. WASSERMAN.

29:20.379 --> 29:23.142
BUT IF YOU FAILED,
I'M SURE WE COULD
CONVINCE HIM

29:23.142 --> 29:24.513
TO LET YOU TAKE
A MAKE-UP TEST
OR SOMETHING.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.305
I DIDN'T FAIL.

29:26.305 --> 29:29.979
- ( chuckles )
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

29:29.979 --> 29:32.691
YOU GOT AN "A"?

29:32.691 --> 29:34.984
I STUDIED FOR A WEEK
AND ONLY GOT A "B."

29:34.984 --> 29:36.445
WELL, I GUESS AMERICAN
HISTORY'S MY BITCH.

29:36.445 --> 29:39.318
COME ON, GIVE ME
MY PHONE BACK.

29:39.318 --> 29:42.321
LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT SCHOOL, OKAY?

29:42.321 --> 29:44.323
LET'S JUST HAVE
A NICE NIGHT.

29:44.323 --> 29:46.705
YEAH, OKAY. IT'S JUST
THIS IS ALL SO EXTRAVAGANT.

29:46.705 --> 29:49.498
I JUST--
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

29:49.498 --> 29:51.831
HERE YOU ARE.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.372
THANKS, BOSS.

29:58.717 --> 30:01.260
YOU SURE MADE
THAT GUY'S NIGHT.

30:05.925 --> 30:07.306
MMM.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.807
REALLY GOOD.
YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE.

30:17.937 --> 30:19.358
YOU COLD?

30:21.780 --> 30:23.993
I LOVE THIS VIEW.

30:23.993 --> 30:25.865
OH, HEY.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.036
I ALMOST FORGOT.

30:33.162 --> 30:34.163
( gasps )

30:39.338 --> 30:40.419
( chuckles )

30:48.767 --> 30:50.309
YOU BRIBED HIM,
DIDN'T YOU?

30:52.771 --> 30:54.683
TO GET AN "A"
ON THE TEST.

30:54.683 --> 30:55.935
( chuckles )

30:55.935 --> 30:57.606
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY
CALL THAT A BRIBE--

30:57.606 --> 30:59.108
I WOULD.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.530
AND NOW YOU'RE BRIBING ME
TO STOP ASKING YOU QUESTIONS.

31:01.530 --> 31:04.033
HERE. TAKE IT.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.985
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
WORKING.

31:08.747 --> 31:10.079
I THINK YOU'RE LYING

31:10.079 --> 31:11.750
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE WOODS WITH YOUR FATHER.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.752
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

31:13.752 --> 31:16.455
HOW MUCH, DANNY?

31:16.455 --> 31:18.757
HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST
FOR YOU TO TELL ME THE TRUTH?

31:18.757 --> 31:20.089
STOP!

31:20.089 --> 31:21.340
YOU JUST WON'T
LET THIS GO,

31:21.340 --> 31:22.381
WILL YOU, LACEY?

31:29.008 --> 31:30.930
IT WOULD JUST BE
SO MUCH EASIER

31:30.930 --> 31:32.471
IF YOU WOULD JUST
ACCEPT THAT.

31:32.471 --> 31:33.933
WELL, I CAN'T.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.354
I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT.

31:37.606 --> 31:40.149
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG?

31:40.149 --> 31:41.280
'CAUSE I CAN'T!

31:41.280 --> 31:42.861
WHY ARE YOU
BEING LIKE THIS?

31:42.861 --> 31:44.863
BECAUSE I KILLED HIM.

31:46.485 --> 31:48.027
I KILLED MY DAD.

32:07.046 --> 32:08.347
WHEN LACEY TOLD ME
ABOUT THE ELECTION

32:08.347 --> 32:09.969
AFTER PARTY
AT JOHNNY CAKES,

32:09.969 --> 32:12.511
I WAS THINKING MORE HOT
GAY CLUB WITH BOTTLE SERVICE.

32:12.511 --> 32:14.974
BOLD SPEECH EARLIER.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.935
I GUESS IT WORKED OUT
WELL FOR YOUR FRIEND.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.147
JO, RIGHT?

32:18.147 --> 32:20.059
YES.

32:20.059 --> 32:21.060
WHITNEY.

32:22.361 --> 32:23.942
OH, I REMEMBER YOU.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.115
YOUR DAD WORKED FOR
DANNY'S DAD, RIGHT?

32:26.115 --> 32:27.776
MM-HMM.

32:27.776 --> 32:30.619
YOU AND DANNY WERE
INSEPARABLE BACK IN THE DAY.

32:30.619 --> 32:32.331
YEAH.

32:32.331 --> 32:35.074
YEAH, IT WAS JUST
ME AND DANNY.

32:35.074 --> 32:37.336
YOU COMING?

32:37.336 --> 32:38.497
I'M GONNA HEAD OUT.

32:38.497 --> 32:40.079
OKAY.
SEE YOU AROUND, JO.

32:45.924 --> 32:47.926
YOU KILLED HIM?

32:49.348 --> 32:51.090
WELL THEN, SOMEONE
STAGED A CAR CRASH.

32:51.090 --> 32:52.761
- THIS IS SO--
- I KNOW, TRUST ME.

32:52.761 --> 32:54.853
- I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY--
- IT SOUNDS INSANE.

32:54.853 --> 32:56.855
I MEAN, IF IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE,
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST--

32:56.855 --> 32:59.938
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO SAY ANYTHING.

33:03.362 --> 33:04.603
BECAUSE OF JO.

33:07.316 --> 33:08.317
JO?

33:08.317 --> 33:10.199
HE WAS TRYING
TO KILL HER, OKAY?

33:10.199 --> 33:12.781
- SHE WAS THERE?
- AND I--

33:12.781 --> 33:15.914
YOU WERE DEFENDING JO?

33:15.914 --> 33:19.328
SO YOU AND JO HAVE BEEN
COVERING FOR EACH OTHER
THIS WHOLE TIME,

33:19.328 --> 33:22.331
AND KEEPING THIS
HUGE SECRET.

33:22.331 --> 33:24.753
AND WITH ME...

33:24.753 --> 33:25.924
( sighs )

33:25.924 --> 33:27.336
YOU JUST LIED.

33:27.336 --> 33:29.508
UNDERSTAND, I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, OKAY?

33:29.508 --> 33:30.929
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

33:30.929 --> 33:32.931
IT'S ALWAYS
THE SAME STORY.

33:32.931 --> 33:33.932
I'M SICK OF IT.

33:33.932 --> 33:35.684
I KNOW IT'S A LOT.
BUT YOU JUST--

33:35.684 --> 33:37.936
A LOT?!

33:37.936 --> 33:39.808
NO. THIS IS TOO MUCH.

33:39.808 --> 33:42.101
THIS ENTIRE TIME
I'VE BEEN DEFENDING YOU,

33:42.101 --> 33:44.853
I'VE BEEN BELIEVING YOU
FOR WHAT?

33:44.853 --> 33:46.024
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU TRUST ME, RIGHT?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.816
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

33:47.816 --> 33:49.778
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.570
BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN
TELL ME ABOUT THE BIGGEST
MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE?

33:53.362 --> 33:54.533
YOU DON'T EVEN
SEE IT, DO YOU?

33:54.533 --> 33:55.824
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

33:55.824 --> 33:57.286
YOU AND JO!

34:00.329 --> 34:04.002
IT'S NOT JUST THE SECRETS
THAT YOU GUYS SHARE.

34:04.002 --> 34:05.334
( sighs )

34:05.334 --> 34:07.926
IT'S BEEN JO ALL ALONG.

34:07.926 --> 34:09.338
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN JO.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.091
NO.

34:25.774 --> 34:26.945
( sighs )

34:26.945 --> 34:29.108
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.109
ME TOO.

34:32.361 --> 34:34.153
I SAID A LOT OF THINGS.

34:34.153 --> 34:34.953
WE BOTH DID.

34:48.627 --> 34:51.049
IS IT EVER
GONNA GET BETTER?

34:52.921 --> 34:54.803
CAN'T SAY.

34:56.345 --> 34:59.598
BUT I DO KNOW YOU NEED
TO FIND THAT CHILD.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.350
( stammers )

35:01.350 --> 35:02.771
I DON'T KNOW.

35:02.771 --> 35:04.102
YES, YOU DO.

35:04.102 --> 35:07.776
YOU GOTTA STOP BURYING IT,
HIDING FROM IT.

35:07.776 --> 35:11.780
MAYBE FINDING THAT CHILD
WILL HELP US FIND OUR WAY BACK.

35:13.782 --> 35:15.073
YOU WANT TO FIND
OUR WAY BACK?

35:20.909 --> 35:22.911
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

35:22.911 --> 35:24.333
I CAN HELP.

35:26.745 --> 35:29.087
WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER.

35:39.348 --> 35:41.350
- HEY.
- HEY.

35:42.931 --> 35:45.934
I, UM...

35:45.934 --> 35:47.936
I SAW YOU LEAVING
JOHNNY CAKES.

35:47.936 --> 35:51.270
YOU LOOKED
PRETTY SAD.

35:52.941 --> 35:54.943
I WAS JUST
PISSED AT MYSELF.

35:54.943 --> 35:56.535
I SHOULD HAVE
PREPPED YOU BETTER.

35:56.535 --> 35:58.116
YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED
TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR YOU,

35:58.116 --> 35:59.908
NOT FOR THE OPPOSITION.

36:00.949 --> 36:02.331
IT'S NOT THAT.

36:02.331 --> 36:03.332
I JUST...

36:05.744 --> 36:08.837
I JUST WENT ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING WRONG.

36:08.837 --> 36:10.999
I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED A CHANGE?

36:10.999 --> 36:14.002
YEAH.

36:14.002 --> 36:16.845
IN MYSELF THOUGH.

36:16.845 --> 36:18.347
I JUST...

36:18.347 --> 36:20.759
( sighs )

36:20.759 --> 36:22.681
I WANTED TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL THE STUFF

36:22.681 --> 36:23.682
THAT'S GOING ON
IN MY LIFE,

36:23.682 --> 36:26.765
SO I THOUGHT IF
I BURIED MYSELF

36:26.765 --> 36:30.899
IN THIS CAMPAIGN
AND IN THE JOB, THEN--

36:30.899 --> 36:32.481
I WAS JUST
RUNNING AWAY.

36:32.481 --> 36:34.273
RUNNING AWAY FROM DANNY.

36:34.273 --> 36:36.945
KIND OF, YEAH.

36:36.945 --> 36:42.371
HE'S JUST BEEN THIS HUGE
PART OF MY LIFE FOR SO LONG.

36:42.371 --> 36:43.912
I MEAN...

36:43.912 --> 36:46.034
EVEN WHEN HE
WENT TO JUVIE.

36:46.034 --> 36:48.457
MAYBE ESPECIALLY THEN.

36:48.457 --> 36:49.458
I DON'T KNOW.

36:50.919 --> 36:53.001
JO, I NEED TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

36:54.333 --> 36:55.334
OKAY.

36:58.337 --> 36:59.928
WHEN I--

36:59.928 --> 37:02.931
WHEN I CAME
TO GREEN GROVE,

37:02.931 --> 37:05.434
I WAS COMING
FROM JUVIE.

37:05.434 --> 37:06.935
JUVIE?

37:06.935 --> 37:09.348
YEAH, I'M NOT
A MURDERER OR ANYTHING--

37:09.348 --> 37:10.479
DID YOU KNOW DANNY?

37:10.479 --> 37:12.941
YEAH.

37:15.354 --> 37:18.277
AND I MAY KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN YOU DO.

37:18.277 --> 37:21.029
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:23.952 --> 37:25.994
HE MIGHT NOT BE
WHO YOU THINK HE IS.

37:31.039 --> 37:32.631
CHARLIE, YOU NEED TO
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

37:32.631 --> 37:35.213
HE WAS ANGRY, JO.

37:35.213 --> 37:36.875
I MEAN,
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,

37:36.875 --> 37:39.217
HE WAS COMING
OUT OF THIS HAZE

37:39.217 --> 37:42.050
OF JUST ALWAYS DOING
EVERYTHING THAT HIS
FATHER TOLD HIM TO.

37:42.050 --> 37:44.222
AND THEN HE REALIZED
THAT HE'D BEEN MANIPULATED

37:44.222 --> 37:45.384
AND LIED TO.

37:45.384 --> 37:47.976
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT...

37:47.976 --> 37:49.558
YEAH.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.521
YEAH, THAT HE TOOK THE FALL
FOR HIS DAD KILLING HIS AUNT.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.353
WHICH IS JUST--

37:54.353 --> 37:57.275
I WOULD HAVE FELT
THE SAME WAY AS DANNY.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.237
YOU MEAN, THAT HE FELT
ANGRY WITH HIS DAD

37:59.237 --> 38:02.491
AND JUST WANTED TO KNOW
WHY HE DID IT?

38:04.072 --> 38:07.035
YEAH.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.116
HE--

38:08.116 --> 38:09.618
HE WAS KIND OF
OBSESSED ABOUT IT THOUGH.

38:09.618 --> 38:12.040
I MEAN...

38:12.040 --> 38:13.211
ONE NIGHT, HE--

38:13.211 --> 38:16.214
HE SWORE TO ME THAT
ONCE HE GOT OUT

38:16.214 --> 38:19.378
HE WOULD FIND HIS DAD
AND KILL HIM.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.301
HE TALKED ABOUT--
ABOUT KILLING HIM?

38:23.301 --> 38:24.883
I WAS RELIEVED

38:24.883 --> 38:27.476
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT
THE CAR ACCIDENT.

38:27.476 --> 38:29.638
MAYBE...

38:29.638 --> 38:33.692
DANNY DIDN'T GET
THE REVENGE HE WANTED,

38:33.692 --> 38:35.233
OR WHATEVER,

38:35.233 --> 38:38.236
BUT...

38:38.236 --> 38:40.819
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T
BECOME A KILLER.

38:53.582 --> 38:55.624
HEY, MY STUDENT GUIDE.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.836
- OH.
- ARE YOU OKAY?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.047
YEAH, I'M FINE.

38:59.047 --> 39:01.460
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

39:01.460 --> 39:03.221
I'VE SEEN THAT
LOOK BEFORE.

39:03.221 --> 39:05.464
IT'S USUALLY IN THE MIRROR
AFTER A BREAKUP.

39:07.636 --> 39:09.347
DANNY, I'M GUESSING?

39:09.347 --> 39:12.230
GOD, HOW MESSED UP IS IT
THAT I STILL CARE ABOUT HIM?

39:14.433 --> 39:18.026
A TOTALLY HUMAN
KIND OF MESSED UP.

39:20.238 --> 39:21.400
JEEZ.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.657
- JACK.
- HEY.

39:28.657 --> 39:30.789
I'M GLAD YOU CAME BY.

39:34.493 --> 39:36.625
I REALIZED THAT
WE NEVER GOT TO TALK

39:36.625 --> 39:39.047
IN ALL THE WHIRLWIND.

39:39.047 --> 39:42.050
MY DAUGHTER HAS A LOT OF
THE SAME TRAITS AS A TORNADO.

39:42.050 --> 39:43.422
- SHE'S WONDERFUL.
- MM-HMM.

39:43.422 --> 39:46.384
AND WATCHING THE TWO OF YOU
THESE LAST COUPLE DAYS--

39:46.384 --> 39:48.637
YOU'VE REALIZED I'M
THE WORST PARENT EVER?

39:48.637 --> 39:52.060
NO. THE EXACT OPPOSITE,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

39:52.060 --> 39:55.063
YOU'RE COMPASSIONATE,

39:55.063 --> 39:57.896
AND STRONG, AND...

39:57.896 --> 40:01.109
I THINK YOU WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO PROTECT
THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE.

40:01.109 --> 40:05.694
THE WAY YOU PROTECTED
ME AND DANNY.

40:05.694 --> 40:07.365
AND I DIDN'T EVEN ASK.

40:07.365 --> 40:09.237
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK,
KAREN.

40:09.237 --> 40:12.621
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR DANNY.

40:12.621 --> 40:14.663
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY MUCH
IN LOVE WITH HIS MOTHER.

40:31.049 --> 40:33.512
I TOLD LACEY THE TRUTH
ABOUT MY DAD.

40:33.512 --> 40:35.263
ALL OF IT.

40:35.263 --> 40:36.725
WE BROKE UP.

40:36.725 --> 40:39.978
THAT'S TOO BAD.

40:39.978 --> 40:41.229
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP
COMING HERE, DANNY.

40:41.229 --> 40:42.561
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU
CAME HERE TO TELL ME--

40:42.561 --> 40:44.903
NOT JUST THAT.

40:44.903 --> 40:46.364
SHE SAID
SOME THINGS ABOUT--

40:46.364 --> 40:48.276
ABOUT YOU AND ME.

40:50.278 --> 40:52.120
WHAT?

40:52.120 --> 40:54.452
WHAT'D SHE SAY?
THAT WE'RE LIARS,

40:54.452 --> 40:56.034
THAT WE'RE CRIMINALS?

40:56.034 --> 40:57.626
NO.

40:57.626 --> 41:01.209
SHE SAID THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING--

41:01.209 --> 41:03.752
THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING BETWEEN US.

41:03.752 --> 41:07.005
DON'T...

41:07.005 --> 41:08.216
DO THIS TO ME,
DANNY.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.758
HAVEN'T YOU
LIED TO ME ENOUGH?

41:09.758 --> 41:11.640
NO, YOU'RE THE ONE PERSON
I HAVEN'T LIED TO.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.301
YOU'RE LYING!

41:13.301 --> 41:16.014
WHEN YOU WERE IN JUVIE,
DID YOU TALK ABOUT
KILLING YOUR DAD?

41:16.014 --> 41:17.395
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

41:17.395 --> 41:19.598
FROM CHARLIE.
WHO WAS IN JUVIE WITH YOU.

41:19.598 --> 41:22.060
- HE TOLD YOU THAT--
WAIT WAIT WAIT.
- YOU KILLED HIM,

41:22.060 --> 41:23.311
AND YOU LET ME THINK
THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

41:23.311 --> 41:25.313
NO, YOU WERE THERE.
YOU WERE THERE. I DIDN'T--

41:25.313 --> 41:28.567
YOU MANIPULATED ME,
AND I COVERED FOR YOU, DANNY.

41:28.567 --> 41:31.660
NO WONDER YOU ARE SO WORRIED
ABOUT BECOMING YOUR DAD.

41:31.660 --> 41:33.241
YOU ARE JUST LIKE HIM!

42:07.065 --> 42:08.907
( engine revs )

42:08.907 --> 42:11.029
( tires squeal )

42:33.221 --> 42:35.053
Vikram:
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME, SON.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.055
GO AWAY.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.306
Vikram: FOREVER!

42:38.306 --> 42:40.058
NO!
