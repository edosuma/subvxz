00:08.583 --> 00:11.250
Lana!

00:11.333 --> 00:12.792
You're supposed
to be helping.

00:12.875 --> 00:16.000
Sorry, Mir, I
forgot
I, uh, left it on
there.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.041
Here. Pass Lit'l Smokies.

00:18.125 --> 00:19.834
Are you sure
this barf is
edible?

00:19.917 --> 00:23.333
Make sure the Jell-O salads
aren't wilting.

00:23.417 --> 00:25.834
As I was saying,
when Violet told me

00:25.917 --> 00:28.417
she had the solution
to my kitchen woes

00:28.500 --> 00:29.750
I thought she'd
found a way to get

00:29.834 --> 00:31.583
my husband home
on time for dinner.

00:31.667 --> 00:34.917
Products are good,
but they're not that good.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.250
These are Kosher, right?

00:36.333 --> 00:39.375
What's unique
is the little burp.

00:39.458 --> 00:42.041
It's the signature sound.
The sound of freshness.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.792
I use this one, the Freeze-It
to store dozens of meals.

00:44.875 --> 00:48.125
She isn't kiddin', ladies. I'll
bet she hasn't cooked in a week.

00:48.208 --> 00:51.542
Honestly, I had no idea
my life could change so
quickly.

00:56.834 --> 00:58.291
But everything's
in the catalog.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.834
Phone me
if you have any questions.

01:43.583 --> 01:45.458
Well, it had to be one of you.

01:45.542 --> 01:47.125
It just didn't
get up and walk away.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.667
What's missing now?

01:48.750 --> 01:51.000
His cinnamon roll.

01:51.083 --> 01:53.041
Don't look at me.
I don't eat breakfast.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.875
- You ate my coffee cake.
- Two years ago.

01:55.959 --> 01:57.417
(Lilly)
'Least someone's eating it.'

01:57.500 --> 02:00.333
Gotta be food in there
older than our cold jobs.

02:00.417 --> 02:02.000
Someone ought
to clean this thing
up.

02:02.083 --> 02:03.583
There's a sponge
right over there.

02:03.667 --> 02:06.834
I ain't the one leaving
things here to rot.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.500
What?

02:10.792 --> 02:12.875
Lana was just telling
me about her sister.

02:12.959 --> 02:14.583
Miriam Forrester.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.834
Killed August '64.

02:17.917 --> 02:20.750
Car hit her on the street by
her
house, threw her into a ditch.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.542
(Lana)
'It was two days
before anyone found her.'

02:22.625 --> 02:24.250
'I was a teenager
at the time.'

02:24.333 --> 02:27.917
Thought my sister was just
a repressed '60s housewife..

02:28.000 --> 02:29.083
But?

02:29.166 --> 02:30.750
Her husband Harold
just passed away.

02:30.834 --> 02:33.208
And his family found some
of her stuff in his garage.

02:33.291 --> 02:36.291
Knickknacks,
junk mail...and this.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.542
Tupperware box?

02:37.625 --> 02:40.041
That was her big thing.
Drove old Harry crazy.

02:40.125 --> 02:43.291
Real man-of-the-times, didn't
want the little wife working.

02:43.375 --> 02:46.083
The thing is,
it's not Tupperware.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.291
That her luggage?

02:47.375 --> 02:50.375
I think someone
was returning it to her.

02:50.458 --> 02:53.166
But, I found this inside.

02:55.834 --> 02:57.917
"I will hunt you
down
where you live."

02:58.000 --> 03:00.750
Box was sent from..

03:00.834 --> 03:02.000
...Hazelton, Mississippi.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.583
Two days before
my sister's body was found.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.000
August '64
was Freedom Summer.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.250
And Hazelton, Mississippi
was where all hell

03:09.333 --> 03:11.792
was breaking loose.
Black and white warfare.

03:11.875 --> 03:12.917
Ain't exactly the place

03:13.000 --> 03:15.125
a suburban housewife
goes for vacation.

03:15.208 --> 03:17.500
Was your sister
involved in some activism?

03:17.583 --> 03:19.625
As far as I knew, she never
left the Philly city limits.

03:19.709 --> 03:22.250
- Didn't even know how to
drive.
- What about her friends?

03:22.333 --> 03:24.333
(Lana)
'Only one friend
I remember, Violet.'

03:24.417 --> 03:26.458
But they just
sold Tupperware together.

03:26.542 --> 03:27.667
Got a last name?

03:27.750 --> 03:30.792
Violet Gold? Golding?

03:30.875 --> 03:32.333
I guess I always
had a certain view

03:32.417 --> 03:34.792
of who my sister was.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.792
Now, I'm not so sure.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.417
Mississippi, huh?

03:38.500 --> 03:40.375
(Lana)
'Please..'

03:40.458 --> 03:42.834
...tell me
you'll look into this.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.208
(Scotty)
'Miriam Forrester'

04:23.291 --> 04:25.917
struck from behind
by an unidentified vehicle

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
on Lincoln Drive.
Found August 8, 1964.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.917
Hmm...she was only
22 years old.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.959
Multiple fractures,
abrasions..

04:36.041 --> 04:38.208
...it's all consistent
with an auto-ped.

04:39.291 --> 04:40.834
'Oh, look at this.'

04:40.917 --> 04:43.000
Puncture wound,
base of the skull.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.291
I've seen severed limbs,
crushed ribs, nothin' like
that.

04:46.375 --> 04:49.917
Body's found in an overgrown
ditch by the road.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.375
Minus one glove.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.375
Burrs in her hair, clothes.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.417
Hmm, might have a better idea

04:55.500 --> 04:57.917
what caused that wound
if decomp hadn't already set
in.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.041
Detectives confirmed
the husband was in Boston

05:00.125 --> 05:01.417
for business
when it happened.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
Failed to mention
his wife's trip to
Mississippi.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.166
Maybe he didn't know.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.542
Well, that all we got?

05:06.625 --> 05:10.041
A trip to Mississippi
during Freedom Summer?

05:10.125 --> 05:13.041
Her overnight bag
was shipped in a Tupperware
box.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.625
'Maybe that's what
brought her down there.'

05:14.709 --> 05:16.542
Yeah, kid sister says
that was her thing.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.667
So, what the heck
do Tupperware

05:18.750 --> 05:21.959
and civil rights
have in common?

05:22.041 --> 05:24.875
Vera's hunting down
Tupperware ladies from
'64.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.041
Now, tell him
to be careful.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.542
Those ladies can
sell snow to Eskimos.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.625
He's putting together
a list of top sellers

05:30.709 --> 05:32.458
from Mount Airy who
might've known
Miriam.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.834
Violet Golding's
name came up, a couple
others.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.750
Take Jeffries,
have a talk with this Violet.

05:36.834 --> 05:37.959
What about
the threat letter?

05:38.041 --> 05:39.583
QD's checking
it out and
Latents

05:39.667 --> 05:42.250
is taking a look
at her overnight
bag.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.625
Oh, and, uh...you're
missing an earring.

05:46.750 --> 05:50.583
Oh, must've...fallen off
on my way to work.

05:54.875 --> 05:55.834
Hey, gorgeous.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.250
- You look good.
- Thanks.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.041
- Uh, you too.
- Yeah.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.375
So I've been thinking..

06:03.458 --> 06:05.667
...you know what
you and me need to do?

06:06.667 --> 06:09.250
- What?
- Go on a date.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.500
I mean,
a real date.

06:12.583 --> 06:15.041
- Okay.
- You like bowling?

06:15.125 --> 06:17.542
[laughs
]
Sure.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.166
Bowling's good.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.709
Saturday night?

06:20.792 --> 06:22.834
Maybe do a little
Italian after?

06:22.917 --> 06:24.875
It'll be good.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.041
Everything okay?

06:27.125 --> 06:28.792
Yeah, yeah, I..

06:28.875 --> 06:30.834
...I just
lost
an
earring.

06:30.917 --> 06:32.417
Oh.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.417
- Where?
- You know where.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.750
Uh, so check
for me, will you?

06:38.834 --> 06:41.291
Check your pocket.

06:42.291 --> 06:43.625
Saturday night.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.417
(Will)
'Violet Golding?'

06:53.500 --> 06:56.500
Detectives
Jeffries, Rush.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.583
You were one of Tupperware's
top sellers back in '64?

06:59.667 --> 07:01.750
Yes. But I don't
sell it anymore.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.041
Wondering if you remember
Miriam Forrester?

07:04.125 --> 07:06.375
I understand the two
of you were friends.

07:06.458 --> 07:09.917
Wow. Haven't heard
that name in a long time.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.834
Your Tupperware parties
ever take you to
Mississippi?

07:12.917 --> 07:14.834
[chuckles]
Lord, no.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.792
You have any idea
what that kind of humidity

07:16.875 --> 07:18.709
does to your hair?

07:18.792 --> 07:22.000
Place was the epicenter
of civil rights action.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.500
Know if Miriam
got involved?

07:23.583 --> 07:26.000
What makes you think Miriam
was ever in Mississippi?

07:26.083 --> 07:28.709
Well, this was found
in her overnight bag.

07:28.792 --> 07:31.917
It was sent
from Hazelton,
Mississippi.

07:33.208 --> 07:35.917
(Will)
'This mean something to you?'

07:38.500 --> 07:41.583
The Tupperware gals
were all about..

07:41.667 --> 07:44.959
...getting a new sofa
or some fancy kitchen
appliance.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.000
But Miriam?

07:46.083 --> 07:47.375
Her thoughts ran
deeper than that.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.291
Lana make it home
alright?

07:56.375 --> 08:00.000
Cute as a button,
that little thing.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.625
Miriam?

08:09.083 --> 08:10.375
I know it's not polite
conversation

08:10.458 --> 08:13.667
but...have you seen
what's going on down there?

08:17.458 --> 08:19.291
It's awful.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.417
Are you alright, Miriam?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.959
Don't stop..

08:30.041 --> 08:31.000
Harold's never home.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.000
Even when he is,
we barely talk.

08:34.667 --> 08:37.291
I'm grateful to you for
showing
me Tupperware, I really am.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.458
It's just sometimes..

08:39.542 --> 08:41.250
What, dear?

08:41.333 --> 08:42.792
Do you ever wonder
if this is all there is?

08:49.792 --> 08:53.291
She was what you would call
a sensitive soul.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.041
Well, Miriam
didn't know how to
drive

08:55.125 --> 08:56.709
and if she went
to Mississippi

08:56.792 --> 08:58.667
she would have needed
someone to take her.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.166
Well, if she did,
it wasn't with me.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.250
I'm sorry.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.959
My open house
starts in five minutes.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.208
(Scotty)
'Hey, look who's back.'

09:16.291 --> 09:19.458
(Kat)
'Hmm, fit some shopping
into your busy day.'

09:19.542 --> 09:21.417
Taking
the Tupperware research

09:21.500 --> 09:22.542
pretty serious, Nick.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.375
You wanted names.

09:24.458 --> 09:25.959
I got you names.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.792
Didn't come cheap,
did it?

09:27.875 --> 09:29.959
Another Tupperware lady
waiting for you.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.667
(Kat)
'Name's Debra Nelson.'

09:33.709 --> 09:35.000
No way.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.125
(Nick)
'You take her.'

09:36.208 --> 09:38.291
I'm done
with these
sharks.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.083
(Kat)
'Been talking to some people
in Tupperware, Debra.'

09:45.166 --> 09:47.166
You made the list
of high sellers in '64.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.583
<i>very</i>
popular back then.

09:49.667 --> 09:50.750
- It still is today.
- Right.

09:50.834 --> 09:52.291
See, then
we looked you up.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.667
Got a string of...arrests
in the '60s and '70s.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.000
Disorderly conduct,
civil disobedience--

09:58.083 --> 09:59.667
I'm proud
of that
record

09:59.750 --> 10:01.583
protesting
for our civil
rights.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.458
And for that,
I thank you.

10:03.542 --> 10:06.041
But in between
protesting

10:06.125 --> 10:08.375
you're selling
Tupperware.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.834
What am I missing here?

10:10.917 --> 10:13.208
Tupperware
was just a cover.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.625
Cover for what, exactly?

10:17.542 --> 10:19.166
Wednesday's Women.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.583
(Debra)
'Housewives who
went to Mississippi.'

10:21.667 --> 10:23.083
Traveled on Tuesday

10:23.166 --> 10:25.917
arrived on Wednesday,
back by the weekend.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.458
Black and white women?
Together?

10:28.542 --> 10:31.041
We brought supplies
for the Freedom Schools.

10:31.125 --> 10:32.583
Tried to help educate
black children

10:32.667 --> 10:36.000
who were being ignored
by the powers-that-be.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.625
You know anyone
in Mississippi who
might've

10:38.709 --> 10:41.000
given this threat
letter to Miriam?

10:41.959 --> 10:43.375
I stayed in Philly.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.834
Made arrangements for the
girls
who were traveling.

10:45.917 --> 10:47.875
Must've been dangerous
work for them.

10:47.959 --> 10:51.959
It was my job to make them
aware of just how dangerous.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.291
<i>["Beautiful Tomorrow"</i>
by

10:53.375 --> 10:54.709
When in public

10:54.792 --> 10:55.959
you have to wear
your white
gloves.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.166
We've got to
look the part

10:57.250 --> 10:59.542
like genteel
Southern

10:59.625 --> 11:01.917

11:13.959 --> 11:15.667

any state below
the Mason-Dixon.

11:17.667 --> 11:18.750
'That's right, Ella.'

the locations

11:20.709 --> 11:22.083
of the Freedom Schools
with anyone.

11:22.166 --> 11:24.583
- Not even each other.
- Why?

11:24.667 --> 11:26.709
Because the KKK
is burning them down.

11:26.792 --> 11:27.917
The schools?

have gone missing

11:29.250 --> 11:31.250
from a town near
where we're going.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.667
College students.
Two white, one black.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.500
Next group leaves
first Tuesday in August.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.667
Whoever wants
to be in it..

11:39.750 --> 11:40.750
..come get your gloves.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.291
Violet Golding was there?

12:12.375 --> 12:15.125
She's the one who introduced
Miriam to the group.

12:15.208 --> 12:16.458
You still have that guestbook?

12:16.542 --> 12:17.667
Sure, I could find it.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.792
So, Violet
not only knew Miriam

12:19.875 --> 12:22.542
went to Mississippi,
she went with her.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.834
Violet, Miriam

12:24.917 --> 12:27.041
Ella, and Belinda.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.792
They all went together.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.709
(Scotty)
'Violet lied.
Went to Mississippi, too.'

12:40.792 --> 12:42.500
On her way in now.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.917
Can't wait to
hear her
excuse.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.000
Mint.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.166
They were out
of vanilla bean.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.792
Oh...thanks.

12:52.041 --> 12:52.959
Oh.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.500
Sorry, man.

12:54.583 --> 12:55.667
You want mine?

12:55.750 --> 12:57.792
It's a triple mocha thing.

12:57.875 --> 12:58.834
Come with a spoon?

12:58.917 --> 13:02.041
[laughs]
That's a good one.

13:03.333 --> 13:04.583
Oh.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.500
Boss, hunting me down.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.542
Catch you later.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.125
Hm.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.875
Found the other women
who traveled

13:16.959 --> 13:18.792
with Miriam and Violet, boss.

13:18.875 --> 13:22.166
Ella Turner died three
years
ago of heart disease.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.500
Belinda Hutchins
relocated to
Hazelton

13:24.583 --> 13:25.709
a month after
Miriam's
death.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.250
Town must have made
quite an impression.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.709
Debra found her files.

13:28.792 --> 13:29.917
Said Miriam's host

13:30.000 --> 13:31.625
was a Kitty Doyle.

13:31.709 --> 13:32.834
Old Hazelton family.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.208
You up for a trip
to Mississippi?

13:36.291 --> 13:38.000
Haven't been
since
high school.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.792
I have relatives
in Jackson.

13:39.875 --> 13:42.709
- Went every summer growing up.
- Well, take someone with you.

13:42.792 --> 13:44.375
Lil and Scotty
went on the last
trip.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.417
- Right now.
- No, that's your stuff.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.542
Look at all
the beautiful..

13:47.625 --> 13:48.959
That leaves.

13:49.041 --> 13:52.709
I don't care. I ain't
buying no damn Tupperware.

13:55.291 --> 13:57.417
Lady's choice.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.583
Is, uh..

14:09.667 --> 14:11.750
...that
your signature?

14:11.834 --> 14:14.500
- Looks like it.
- Hmm.

14:14.583 --> 14:18.000
Got it from a meeting
for Wednesday's Women.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.458
Ever hear of it?

14:19.542 --> 14:22.250
We're gonna ask you
again, Violet.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.542
You ever been
to Mississippi?

14:28.625 --> 14:31.208
Tried like hell
to forget all of it.

14:31.291 --> 14:34.000
Wednesday's Women...Hazelton.

14:34.834 --> 14:37.625
Who gave Miriam..

14:37.709 --> 14:38.917
...this letter?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.041
We all had
different
hosts

14:41.125 --> 14:42.625
different
assignments.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.792
I never saw that letter.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.709
Tell us what happened
down there.

14:47.792 --> 14:50.041
We were all so hopeful.

14:50.125 --> 14:53.041
We really thought we
could make a
difference.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.583
We should have turned around
when we had the chance.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.792
(Miriam)
'Violet, I'm trying
to concentrate.'

15:04.875 --> 15:07.166
You're doing swell
for your first time.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.291
You just got to give
<i>gas.</i>

15:09.375 --> 15:11.917
At this rate, we won't make it
to Mississippi till Christmas.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.792
Oh, I think she
can do better than that.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.000
How about you, Ella?

15:21.083 --> 15:23.834
Didn't even
realize
we were moving.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.500
I know how you feel
about this car, Violet.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.917
You talk more about your pride
and joy than you do Alfred.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.333
Well, my husband isn't as
pretty
as my Studebaker, now is he?

15:31.417 --> 15:32.500
(all)
Ooh!

15:32.583 --> 15:33.917
(Violet)
'Oh, come on, Miriam.'

15:34.000 --> 15:36.625
This ain't Harold's
old Buick. Floor it.

15:44.583 --> 15:46.166
Car!

15:52.917 --> 15:54.250
It's okay now.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.917
Wow, look at us.
We're flying.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.834
(man over the radio)
'We interrupt this program
for breaking news.'

16:13.917 --> 16:15.375
'The missing
civil rights workers'

16:15.458 --> 16:17.750
'Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman,
were found dead today.'

16:17.834 --> 16:19.166
'President Lin..'

16:23.875 --> 16:25.959
They killed them.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.083
We can't turn back
now.
We gotta keep going.

16:32.166 --> 16:34.917
Miriam...you
don't
have to do this.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.667
Yes, I do.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.959
This isn't just
about me anymore.

16:44.375 --> 16:46.083
It's about..

16:46.166 --> 16:47.959
...Alfred making
you go to his
church

16:48.041 --> 16:50.917
instead of where you
were brought up to go.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.375
It's about you and Craig
losing your jobs at the
factory.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.166
About your parents
thinking the only reason

16:55.250 --> 16:56.667
why you got
a college education

16:56.750 --> 16:58.792
'was to marry
a better man.'

17:00.709 --> 17:02.750
About all of us.

17:03.709 --> 17:06.083
And our friendship.

17:06.166 --> 17:09.250
And the world telling us
that we can't be friends.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.625
Alright, then.

17:25.709 --> 17:28.041
Let's get this car on the road.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.750
When was the last time
you saw her?

17:40.834 --> 17:42.875
The drive back.

17:42.959 --> 17:45.125
Seventeen hours of silence.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.291
Where'd you drop her off?

17:46.375 --> 17:48.083
Near her house,
Friday night.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.458
- Without her luggage?
- I didn't notice.

17:50.542 --> 17:53.834
We were all pretty upset
by what we had seen down there.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.917
We were told
to keep a low profile.

17:59.041 --> 18:01.458
But that wasn't
who Miriam was anymore.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.917
Three hours on a plane,
and another two in this tin
can.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.917
Ah, try 17 hours
in an old beater

18:18.000 --> 18:20.667
with leather
seats
and no AC.

18:20.750 --> 18:24.500
That's some cruel
and unusual family vacation.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.041
Yeah, dad always
made us stop

18:26.125 --> 18:28.542
at this catfish
joint,
Aunt Margie's.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.667
Said it was the
best
in the state.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.875
Is it far from here?

18:34.875 --> 18:38.000
(male #1)
'Wednesday's Women, you say?'

18:38.083 --> 18:39.375
'Be honest, that
type of thing'

18:39.458 --> 18:42.208
'could have gotten her
in trouble back then.'

18:42.291 --> 18:44.166
If someone had
found out.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.667
I always thought
it was strange

18:45.750 --> 18:48.917
her coming all the way to
Mississippi to sell
Tupperware.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.375
Why did you let her
stay with you?

18:50.458 --> 18:53.792
Church said a nice lady
from up North needed a bed.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.834
I thought it was
the Christian thing to do.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.166
(Kat)
'You were the one who sent'

18:57.250 --> 18:59.041
Miriam's overnight case
back to her?

18:59.125 --> 19:01.959
Yes, I used
the same box

19:02.041 --> 19:03.875
that I bought
the Tupperware in.

19:03.959 --> 19:07.083
Uh, you were home on leave
right then, weren't you?

19:07.166 --> 19:09.208
My sister's
hospitality extends

19:09.291 --> 19:11.834
to more than
just strangers.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.709
Why didn't she
take her bag with
her?

19:13.792 --> 19:17.709
(Kitty)
'I don't know. She was here
on a Thursday night'

19:17.792 --> 19:19.667
and then, in the morning
she was gone.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.959
(Kitty)
'Didn't even say
goodbye or anything.'

19:22.041 --> 19:24.917
I...thought it was rude
at the time, but..

19:25.000 --> 19:27.500
Puts things into focus.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.750
Things such as?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.709
That time we were in town.

19:30.792 --> 19:33.291
Ms. Miriam saw
that pretty black lady.

19:33.375 --> 19:34.625
You knew something
was amiss.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.250
You need anything
from a store

19:44.333 --> 19:46.000
Jim can always
bring you into town.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.291
Oh. Appreciate
your kindness, Jim.

19:48.375 --> 19:49.667
Yeah, wouldn't
want you
thinking

19:49.750 --> 19:52.041
we're all a bunch
of hicks down
here.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.750
I got to admit,
I still think you talk
funny.

19:54.834 --> 19:55.834
(Miriam)
'Oh, yeah?'

19:55.917 --> 19:57.250
Well, you talk funny, too.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.500
What are you gonna do once
Jim's Army leave's over?

20:02.583 --> 20:04.417
I mean, I only just
learned
how to drive myself.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.458
Don't know.

20:05.542 --> 20:07.333
Now, when exactly
that gonna be, Jim?

20:07.417 --> 20:09.083
Ha ha, ain't you funny?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.959
All he wants to do is

20:11.041 --> 20:13.667
waste time with his friends.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.375
To be young again.

20:15.458 --> 20:16.834
'There they are now.'

20:16.917 --> 20:19.667
Jonathan, you tell
your mama thanks

20:19.750 --> 20:22.458
for that ambrosia
now, you hear?

20:23.625 --> 20:26.417
Watch what you're
doing there, gal.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.291
- You two know each other?
- No, ma'am.

20:30.375 --> 20:32.792
What she means is we...we
saw each other yesterday.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.333
She was inquiring if I was
in need of a maid service.

20:35.417 --> 20:38.458
And she told me
she was just visiting

20:38.542 --> 20:39.792
but maybe the lady
of the house--

20:39.875 --> 20:42.083
I certainly don't need
a clumsy maid.

20:42.166 --> 20:43.625
(Kitty)
'Thank you.'

20:48.166 --> 20:50.792
This the woman Miriam saw?

20:50.875 --> 20:51.750
Why, yes.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.834
Dear, yes,
that's her.

20:53.917 --> 20:57.250
"Clumsy maid" graduated
top of her class from Penn.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.875
Explains why she
was so mad at the time.

21:01.959 --> 21:03.250
I guess.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.667
(Jim)
'Those were
dark days for us all'

21:05.750 --> 21:07.250
but things
are different now.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.291
There's a new South--

21:08.375 --> 21:10.000
KKK was driving
activists

21:10.083 --> 21:11.417
to the county line
forcing them

21:11.500 --> 21:13.166
out of town back then.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.834
'Anyone you
can think of'

21:14.917 --> 21:17.166
'had a problem with
Miriam being here?'

21:17.250 --> 21:18.166
No.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.583
She was a charmer.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.291
Certainly made
me see Yankees

21:21.375 --> 21:23.500
in a different light.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.375
Know who might
have given her
this?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.166
Goodness, no.

21:30.250 --> 21:33.583
But if she was sneaking
around in that group

21:33.667 --> 21:36.875
like you say,
ain't no telling.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.625
- Don't throw it like a
girl.
- Now, watch it, buddy.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.709
And Rush steps
up to the line.

21:49.792 --> 21:52.208
It's all hanging
in the balance here, folks.

21:52.291 --> 21:54.375
Everything riding
on this shot.

21:54.458 --> 21:58.500
Will she or won't she
get to keep the shoes?

22:09.041 --> 22:12.542
- I am kicking your butt!
- I'm a bowling shark, lady.

22:12.625 --> 22:13.750
Alright?
I'm just priming you
up.

22:13.834 --> 22:14.875
Don't be such
a sore sport.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Ain't over
till it's
over.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.834
The boss?

22:23.917 --> 22:25.166
Yeah?

22:27.041 --> 22:29.917
'When? What?'

22:33.041 --> 22:35.291
It's happening.

22:36.375 --> 22:38.166
Kept trying to stall it.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.458
Tell 'em that they
should
take somebody else.

22:43.709 --> 22:45.375
But it's you.

22:45.458 --> 22:46.709
Yeah.

22:49.417 --> 22:50.625
Wow. When?

22:50.709 --> 22:53.417
I think they
ship out later
tonight.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.709
So what does this mean?

22:55.792 --> 22:58.542
You gonna roll into town
under cover of darkness

22:58.625 --> 23:00.458
'and drop me
secret letters'

23:00.542 --> 23:02.625
if I promise not
to blow your cover?

23:03.959 --> 23:07.375
I should have told you
before you took advantage of
me.

23:08.959 --> 23:10.875
Uh, don't look so guilty.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.125
'It's alright.'

23:13.208 --> 23:15.875
- It really is.
- Ain't guilt I'm feeling.

23:19.375 --> 23:21.458
You're gonna miss me.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.625
Tell you what.
Night's still
young.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.834
Want to pick up
a bottle of wine

23:38.917 --> 23:41.667
hit this place I know?

23:41.750 --> 23:43.500
Wine's good.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.583
But how about
we skip dinner?

23:49.208 --> 23:51.500
Let's get out of here.

23:58.417 --> 24:00.625
(Scotty)
'Spent the whole morning
comparing Miriam's'

24:00.709 --> 24:03.000
puncture wound
with other
auto-peds.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.291
Still don't make sense.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.041
Cars were tanks back then.

24:06.125 --> 24:09.000
Could've been something
on the hood?

24:09.083 --> 24:11.875
Hood ornament?

24:11.959 --> 24:14.000
Nah, car's too low.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.625
Report's back
from Questioned Documents.

24:15.709 --> 24:18.667
ESDA machine got an impression
off Miriam's letter.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.250
'So what'd they
give you?'

24:20.333 --> 24:21.875
Name Cordell.

24:21.959 --> 24:25.750
Anonymous letter isn't
so anonymous after all.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.041
Belinda Hutchins?

24:35.583 --> 24:37.125
Yes? I'm Belinda Hutchins.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.542
Detectives
Jeffries,
Miller.

24:38.625 --> 24:39.875
Philadelphia
Police Department.

24:39.959 --> 24:42.375
This place used
to be a Freedom School?

24:42.458 --> 24:44.542
The last one standing.
How can I help you?

24:44.625 --> 24:46.458
We're investigating
the possible murder

24:46.542 --> 24:47.917
of Miriam Forrester.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.959
Understand you took
a trip with her

24:50.041 --> 24:51.792
down here summer of '64.

24:51.875 --> 24:52.792
That's right.

24:52.875 --> 24:55.333
You ever see
this letter?

24:59.959 --> 25:01.542
Did someone
give this to Miriam?

25:01.625 --> 25:04.583
Name Cordell mean
anything to you?

25:09.834 --> 25:12.583
I knew
angry,

25:12.667 --> 25:13.583
You knew the guy?

25:13.667 --> 25:14.792
Most of the white residents

25:14.875 --> 25:17.417
saw us as invaders.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.291
Threatening
their way of
life.

25:20.375 --> 25:23.083
But they weren't the only
ones
who didn't want us around.

25:27.041 --> 25:28.250
You pick a poem, Lavan?

25:32.959 --> 25:34.333
"Mother to Son?"

25:35.834 --> 25:38.667
'"Life for me ain't been
no crystal stair.'

25:38.750 --> 25:41.417
"It's had tacks in it,
and splinters

25:41.500 --> 25:42.959
"And boards torn up.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.792
"And places with
no carpet on the
floor.

25:45.875 --> 25:47.709
"Bare.

25:47.792 --> 25:52.291
But all the time
I've been a-climbing
on."

25:52.375 --> 25:54.417
I like that one.

25:58.625 --> 26:02.041
Penny, it's your turn.
You choose the next poem.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.041
What's the matter?

26:03.125 --> 26:04.041
One of the
girls
said she's

26:04.125 --> 26:06.166
writing
a poem for me.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.834
Said it'd be done next week.

26:08.917 --> 26:10.417
I didn't have
the heart to tell
her

26:10.500 --> 26:12.917
I'll be long gone by then.

26:14.709 --> 26:15.875
Belinda, you're doing
what you can.

26:15.959 --> 26:18.625
But they
still need so
much.

26:18.709 --> 26:20.458
We're here
together at least.

26:20.542 --> 26:21.667
So, we'll double
our efforts and we'll

26:21.750 --> 26:24.000
make the most
of the time that we have.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.083
(male #2)
'Feel real proud
of yourself, don't you?'

26:28.166 --> 26:29.500
Excuse me?

26:29.583 --> 26:32.166
I've tried to go along with
you do-gooders comin' down..

26:32.250 --> 26:33.166
...but not anymore.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.792
Not with schools
being burned.

26:34.875 --> 26:36.834
- That's not because of us.
- Isn't it?

26:36.917 --> 26:39.208
White volunteers
like you come pass out pencils

26:39.291 --> 26:40.500
and all the sudden
the Klan somehow knows

26:40.583 --> 26:41.917
the locations
of our schools.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.166
We're here because we want
to help the Freedom
Schools.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.750
You willing
to die for it?

26:46.834 --> 26:48.500
'We'd all be better off..'

26:48.583 --> 26:50.333
...if you'd
go back home..

26:50.417 --> 26:53.333
...and never come back.

26:56.709 --> 26:58.583
Two other schools
he started were burned

26:58.667 --> 27:00.542
to the ground by the Klan.

27:00.625 --> 27:02.166
You know
where to find him?

27:02.250 --> 27:05.333
He teaches law
at the university.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.792
(Kat)
'Recognize her, Professor?'

27:11.875 --> 27:13.792
One of the volunteers
who came down

27:13.875 --> 27:15.959
the summer of '64, isn't she?

27:16.041 --> 27:17.375
(Will)
'Miriam Forrester.'

27:17.458 --> 27:19.375
Part of Wednesday's Women.

27:19.458 --> 27:21.458
Weren't exactly a fan
of the group, were you?

27:21.542 --> 27:22.750
What's it matter now?

27:22.834 --> 27:24.709
(Kat)
'Miriam was run down in
Philly.'

27:24.792 --> 27:27.208
Two days after
leaving Hazelton.

27:27.291 --> 27:29.208
You think I had
something to do with
it?

27:29.291 --> 27:31.000
She was the reason
your Freedom Schools

27:31.083 --> 27:32.500
got bombed, right?

27:32.583 --> 27:33.959
(Will)
'That's what you said
the day you two'

27:34.041 --> 27:35.667
had the shout-down.

27:35.750 --> 27:39.208
We know how upset
you were,
Professor.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.792
What happened
to your
brother.

27:40.875 --> 27:43.375
(Will)
'Kind of anger
you must have been feeling?'

27:43.458 --> 27:46.083
Schools burning down
only made it worse.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.375
No one gave a damn
about the black
folk

27:47.458 --> 27:49.250
being killed
that summer.

27:49.333 --> 27:52.375
(Kat)
'Only cared about finding
those two white college
boys.'

27:52.458 --> 27:55.500
- What were their names?
- Goodman and Schwerner.

27:57.125 --> 27:58.417
Right.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.709
Goodman and Schwerner.

28:00.792 --> 28:02.959
Thing was, while the FBI's
trawling the bogs

28:03.041 --> 28:06.750
for those white boys,
they find seven other black
men

28:06.834 --> 28:09.542
'murdered and tossed
in the swamps like trash.'

28:09.625 --> 28:12.417
They were relieved
every time it was a black
man.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.834
Not one of the white
boys
being found dead.

28:18.166 --> 28:19.834
Just another critter.

28:19.917 --> 28:23.291
Except one of those
"critters"
was your brother, Keith.

28:23.375 --> 28:24.750
(Will)
'Got your DMV records.'

28:24.834 --> 28:28.834
Inherited your brother's old
station wagon after he died.

28:28.917 --> 28:31.000
What makes you think
I cared enough

28:31.083 --> 28:33.125
to follow
that woman up North?

28:33.208 --> 28:35.458
Your own words.

28:35.542 --> 28:37.959
"I will hunt you down
where you live."

28:38.041 --> 28:41.000
(Will)
'Your name was
on that letter, Cordell.'

28:41.083 --> 28:43.291
That's right.

28:43.375 --> 28:45.834
I gave her this letter.

28:45.917 --> 28:47.375
But I didn't write it.

29:02.083 --> 29:04.041
I know you think this
is just a lark for me.

29:04.125 --> 29:05.250
That I'll
compromise
the work being--

29:05.333 --> 29:07.417
Surprised
you're still here.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.542
I'm here because
the people up North

29:08.625 --> 29:09.625
don't understand
what's going--.

29:09.709 --> 29:10.750
'Cause it don't
matter to them.

29:10.834 --> 29:12.417
It matters to me.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.166
And to the people
of Philadelphia.

29:14.250 --> 29:17.041
- To the whole country.
- Then show 'em this!

29:23.750 --> 29:25.125
Someone gave this to you?

29:25.208 --> 29:28.417
Get them every day
practically.
Paper my walls with 'em.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.750
People need to hear about this.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.917
You think
it'll change anything?

29:33.083 --> 29:34.709
It changed me.

29:38.542 --> 29:40.625
Come on!
Alright, come on!

29:40.709 --> 29:41.792
'Hurry up.
Come on.'

29:41.875 --> 29:43.375
Let's go,
hurry up.

29:43.458 --> 29:44.500
Come on.

29:44.583 --> 29:45.792
You okay?

29:52.250 --> 29:55.750
Building was nothing
but ashes after that.

29:55.834 --> 29:57.125
Any idea who did it?

29:57.208 --> 29:59.542
Freedom Summer?

29:59.625 --> 30:01.166
Klan membership
in Hazelton went

30:01.250 --> 30:04.208
from a few hundred
to eight thousand.

30:04.291 --> 30:06.500
Too many to finger.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.625
Probably some with badges.

30:09.709 --> 30:12.458
Anyone see Miriam coming
or going to the school?

30:12.542 --> 30:15.625
Maybe the same person
who threw that bomb.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.959
I thought she
might've kept her word.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.917
Tried to tell
the world what was

30:22.000 --> 30:23.792
really going on here.

30:23.875 --> 30:26.000
The thing is..

30:26.083 --> 30:28.041
...she never got the chance.

30:32.792 --> 30:34.792
The things
are everywhere.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.125
Oh, these burrs made
a real mess of my
hair

30:37.208 --> 30:38.417
when I was a kid.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.917
Red clay
all over my
clothes

30:40.000 --> 30:41.041
mud between my toes.

30:41.125 --> 30:44.333
Sounds like
a tomboy heaven.

30:44.417 --> 30:46.583
Think they'll ever find
out
who killed Cordell's
brother?

30:46.667 --> 30:48.875
I think they'd rather
forget it ever happened.

30:48.959 --> 30:51.917
Along with segregation,
Jim Crow.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.667
Mm, stuff
Veronica
will read about

30:53.750 --> 30:55.250
in her history books.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.709
I just thank God
she's growing up
now.

30:59.834 --> 31:02.709
There were burrs
in Miriam's clothes,
right?

31:02.792 --> 31:05.125
and

31:05.208 --> 31:07.250
What if she
picked them up here?

31:07.333 --> 31:09.917
- In Hazelton?
- Just like I did.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.125
But why would a lady
like Miriam drive
home

31:12.208 --> 31:15.250
17 hours
with burrs in her
hair?

31:18.208 --> 31:20.709
Miriam's injuries
just weren't sitting right.

31:20.792 --> 31:23.667
I'm looking for anything,
so I pull the DMV records

31:23.750 --> 31:25.500
for Violet's '56 Studebaker.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.458
The car she
drove
to Mississippi?

31:27.542 --> 31:30.667
Turns out she junks it
at Meyer's Salvage

31:30.750 --> 31:32.959
September '64,
a few weeks after her trip.

31:33.041 --> 31:34.792
Scrapped her
"pride and
joy"?

31:34.875 --> 31:36.166
She's trying
to hide something.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.667
(Nick)
'Miller was right.'

31:37.750 --> 31:39.125
The burr found
on Miriam's body

31:39.208 --> 31:41.041
was a Dixie tick trefoil.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.792
Only found in Mississippi
and four surrounding states.

31:43.875 --> 31:46.291
So how does a body with
evidence from
Mississippi

31:46.375 --> 31:48.291
end up in Philly?

31:48.375 --> 31:51.041
Philly was the dump site.
She was already dead.

31:51.125 --> 31:52.333
Violet got rid
of her car

31:52.417 --> 31:55.291
'cause it was used
to transport a body.

31:55.375 --> 31:58.333
And all this time
they've been covering it
up.

32:11.834 --> 32:15.333
Whatever happened
to that Studebaker, Violet?

32:17.291 --> 32:19.208
I don't recall.

32:19.291 --> 32:21.792
(Lilly)
'Your "pride and joy."'

32:21.875 --> 32:24.375
That's what Miriam called it.

32:24.458 --> 32:25.917
'Sure you can't
remember?'

32:26.000 --> 32:28.500
It was time
for a
Cadillac.

32:28.583 --> 32:30.500
Let me refresh
your memory.

32:31.667 --> 32:33.792
Your precious Studebaker
was in a scrap heap

32:33.875 --> 32:35.125
two weeks
after your trip.

32:35.208 --> 32:37.166
There's red clay
under Miriam's nails

32:37.250 --> 32:40.291
burrs in her hair that
only come from Mississippi.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.709
Now, what happened?

32:46.125 --> 32:48.083
We didn't kill her.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.542
But you brought Miriam's
body back to Philly.

32:50.625 --> 32:53.333
We didn't know
what else to
do.

32:56.291 --> 32:57.750
We didn't even..

32:57.834 --> 33:00.709
...know anything was wrong..

33:01.875 --> 33:04.542
...until we got the call.

33:04.625 --> 33:06.250
What call?

33:06.333 --> 33:08.125
A man called Violet

33:08.208 --> 33:09.709
at her host's house

33:09.792 --> 33:13.417
and said he knew
who we were

33:13.500 --> 33:15.875
and why we
were there.

33:15.959 --> 33:18.667
Said we'd best
come get Miriam.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.875
Get our black
asses
out of Hazelton

33:20.959 --> 33:24.125
before the same
thing
happened to us.

33:26.792 --> 33:29.625
(Lilly)
'Come to get Miriam where?'

33:29.709 --> 33:31.208
Tell me
what happened, Violet.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.875
You don't have
to keep this anymore.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.583
At the swamp.

33:51.542 --> 33:53.083
Miriam?

34:00.667 --> 34:02.792
We were babies.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.834
Scared out of our minds.

34:05.917 --> 34:07.667
You didn't
go for help?

34:07.750 --> 34:10.750
I was naive enough
to think we could.

34:15.458 --> 34:18.291
- We got to get help.
- Call the cops.

34:18.375 --> 34:21.333
For all we know,
it's the cops who did this.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.000
<i>now!</i>

34:38.000 --> 34:40.792
(Violet)
'The tire tracks ran off..'

34:40.875 --> 34:43.166
'...into the swamp.'

34:47.542 --> 34:49.250
A hood ornament..

34:49.333 --> 34:51.917
... from the car
that hit Miriam?

34:53.333 --> 34:56.250
I kept her
glove
all this time.

34:58.542 --> 35:01.792
Hasn't been a day
in 40 years that..

35:03.291 --> 35:06.500
...I haven't gone
through it all in my
mind

35:06.583 --> 35:09.333
wondered how it could
have been different.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.166
No car
couldn't have caused

35:17.250 --> 35:19.542
that wound
on Miriam's skull.

35:19.625 --> 35:21.333
Hood ornament
would have been too low.

35:21.417 --> 35:22.750
But a truck could.

35:22.834 --> 35:25.041
Only a couple of 'em
had fancy ornaments.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.208
That a GMC Deluxe?

35:26.291 --> 35:28.208
Yeah, and guess
who reported one stolen

35:28.291 --> 35:31.208
in Hazelton,
summer of '64.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.709
(Jim)
'Why are we here?'

35:35.792 --> 35:38.792
You remember the truck you
reported missing in '64, Jim?

35:38.875 --> 35:40.834
We're gonna do you a solid,
help you find it.

35:40.917 --> 35:42.458
(Kat)
'We got an idea
of where to look.'

35:42.542 --> 35:44.208
(Will)
'Hidden at the bottom
of the swamp.'

35:44.291 --> 35:46.458
But you've always
known where it
was.

35:46.542 --> 35:48.291
Now, wa-wait a second.

35:49.500 --> 35:52.041
Summer of '64,
every Tom, Dick, and Harry

35:52.125 --> 35:54.375
joined the Ku Klux Klan,
took up arms.

35:54.458 --> 35:57.000
- You wanted to be one of 'em.
- No, You're wrong about that.

35:57.083 --> 36:00.375
My family believed in
equal protection for
everybody.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.166
- Always had.
- Your family, yes.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.583
But you weren't
like your family.

36:04.667 --> 36:06.041
You weren't home
on leave.

36:06.125 --> 36:07.875
You lied
to your sister.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.458
You were thrown out of the Army
for dishonorable conduct.

36:10.542 --> 36:11.792
Um, kicked out
of high school.

36:11.875 --> 36:13.417
Couldn't keep a
job
at the sawmill.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
KKK was the only club
that would have you.

36:15.583 --> 36:18.583
I made good over the years,
I did a lot of good things.

36:18.667 --> 36:20.417
Don't change the past.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.542
Hiding behind white sheets,
burning crosses..

36:23.625 --> 36:25.333
...Molotov cocktails.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.417
The New South, right, Jim?

36:27.500 --> 36:29.625
'Miriam disappeared
same night as your pickup.'

36:29.709 --> 36:31.750
(Kat)
'You find out
what she was really up to'

36:31.834 --> 36:33.917
'try to run her
out of town?'

36:34.000 --> 36:36.834
(Will)
'We're gonna pull your truck
out of the swamp, Jim.'

36:36.917 --> 36:40.834
Talk now or the evidence is
going to do the talking for
you.

36:44.417 --> 36:47.000
I never meant
that lady harm.

36:47.083 --> 36:49.834
What went wrong, Jim?

36:49.917 --> 36:51.458
I thought she was..

36:51.542 --> 36:53.625
...a silly housewife.

36:53.709 --> 36:56.333
Learned the hard way
she was a lot more than that.

37:11.375 --> 37:14.792
Saw you buy those pencils
at the five-and-dime
yesterday.

37:15.875 --> 37:17.667
You ain't down here
to sell Tupperware.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.417
Are you, Miss Miriam?

37:20.500 --> 37:22.583
I don't see the reason
for us to be out here,
Jim.

37:22.667 --> 37:23.917
I heard
some fool firebombed

37:24.000 --> 37:25.875
another one
of them colored schools.

37:25.959 --> 37:27.792
Shame, ain't it?

37:28.917 --> 37:31.625
Funny thing is
I could have sworn I saw you

37:31.709 --> 37:33.125
on that same road..

37:33.208 --> 37:34.875
...with a critter.

37:34.959 --> 37:36.792
I want you
to take me home now.

37:36.875 --> 37:39.959
Hey,
critter-lover.
Where you going?

37:40.041 --> 37:42.083
Hey, boys, y'all are just
in time. Miss Miriam was

37:42.166 --> 37:44.125
just about to tell me
about that colored school.

37:44.208 --> 37:45.333
I don't know what
you're talking
about.

37:45.417 --> 37:47.417
I hear there's
only one left.

37:48.917 --> 37:50.583
(Jim)
'Now, tell us
where it's at.'

37:50.667 --> 37:51.834
Real reason
you're in Mississippi

37:51.917 --> 37:53.375
and we can all
just go home.

37:53.458 --> 37:54.875
Your sister told you
why I'm here.

37:54.959 --> 37:55.875
It's to sell Tupperware.

37:55.959 --> 37:58.667
That's bull,
and you know it.

37:58.750 --> 38:01.458
The women of Hazelton haven't
had the pleasure of
experiencing

38:01.542 --> 38:03.250
this revolutionary
new product.

38:03.333 --> 38:05.166
(Miriam)
'W-When you close the lid,
it makes a little burp.'

38:05.250 --> 38:07.667
It's the signature sound,
the sound of freshness.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.125
This is a damn joke.

38:09.208 --> 38:11.041
I-I used to spend hours
in the kitchen, but now--

38:11.125 --> 38:12.750
Shut your mouth about
the damn Tupperware!

38:12.834 --> 38:14.750
I saw the way you looked
at that darky in town.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.291
You knew her.

38:16.375 --> 38:19.333
You ain't
no Tupperware lady.

38:19.417 --> 38:20.583
I can tell you
anything you wanna know

38:20.667 --> 38:22.375
about the product
because I use it myself.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.959
Hey, where you going?

38:29.125 --> 38:31.125
Is you some
kind of
idiot?

38:31.208 --> 38:33.750
This lady
don't
know squat.

38:33.834 --> 38:35.917
Tell him.
Would you tell
him?

38:37.125 --> 38:39.083
Before they leave?

38:41.208 --> 38:42.709
Where do you think
you're going?

38:42.792 --> 38:44.125
Don't touch me.

38:44.208 --> 38:46.333
You're pathetic.

39:16.834 --> 39:19.750
(Lilly)
'I don't understand,
Violet.'

39:19.834 --> 39:22.083
Your friend was dead.

39:22.166 --> 39:24.542
Now, why didn't you
go to the police?

39:24.625 --> 39:26.083
Report what happened?

39:26.166 --> 39:27.417
We did.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.333
We didn't stop
till
we got to
Philly.

39:29.417 --> 39:32.250
We thought
it'd be safe
here.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.959
The North, right?

39:39.875 --> 39:43.834
(Violet)
My name's Violet Golding.

39:43.917 --> 39:46.250
We need to talk
to someone.

39:46.333 --> 39:48.000
- You with them?
- Excuse me?

39:48.083 --> 39:49.458
I'm sorry,
I-I know how
strange

39:49.542 --> 39:51.250
this must seem,
but if you'll just
listen to--

39:51.333 --> 39:53.333
Hang on a sec.

39:53.417 --> 39:54.792
Now, are these women
bothering you?

39:54.875 --> 39:58.333
You're shaking
like a leaf. Look, sit down.

39:59.291 --> 40:01.417
You two, come with me.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.250
(Violet)
'But we have
to do something.'

40:04.333 --> 40:05.375
Oh, I'll take care of it.

40:05.458 --> 40:07.375
- Don't you worry.
- Stop.

40:07.458 --> 40:08.709
Please.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.625
We have to tell you
what happened.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.125
Two coloreds and a Jew
walking into a police station

40:15.208 --> 40:18.125
at 3:00 AM.
Now, this is gonna be good.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.500
Please...Violet.

40:21.583 --> 40:23.583
Come on.
Let's just go.

40:25.250 --> 40:26.917
(Belinda)
'Come on. Come on.'

40:28.500 --> 40:30.417
Let's just get
out of here.
