WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.923
[June] Previously
on The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.089 --> 00:05.970
I encourage you
to give Fred a proper funeral.

00:06.722 --> 00:08.809
I got them to say yes.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.187
How?

00:10.312 --> 00:11.481
By not being a woman.

00:12.149 --> 00:13.569
Don't you look lovely, dear.

00:13.694 --> 00:16.032
Aunt Lydia, do you think
if the Putnams choose Esther,

00:16.157 --> 00:18.663
that maybe I can visit her?

00:18.955 --> 00:20.499
I don't want to get posted.

00:20.917 --> 00:24.006
Get your Commander to like you,
you'll get pregnant faster.

00:24.340 --> 00:26.177
[Commander Putnam] I want to get
to know you a little better.

00:27.012 --> 00:28.348
You care for a chocolate?

00:28.431 --> 00:30.728
I need your help.
It's about getting Hannah.

00:31.271 --> 00:32.439
Again with this?

00:32.732 --> 00:35.530
She needs to be
with me and her father.

00:35.613 --> 00:38.493
[Lawrence] Does she?
She has a lovely home.

00:38.619 --> 00:39.705
[June] That is not her home!

00:39.830 --> 00:40.873
I love you.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.169
[Mark] Wouldn't you like
to see your daughter in-person

00:43.295 --> 00:44.715
rather than asking about her?

00:44.965 --> 00:45.883
That's a pipe dream.

00:46.510 --> 00:48.096
If you play your part
for a while,

00:48.221 --> 00:49.473
we could help each other.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.852
[Esther]
You don't care about me.

00:51.144 --> 00:52.187
You used me.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.356
[coughing]

00:53.440 --> 00:54.901
-Somebody, help!
-[retching]

00:55.027 --> 00:57.114
No! Oh, God! Janine!

00:57.949 --> 00:59.368
You sent her a finger.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.707
How is that gonna help
our family?

01:01.832 --> 01:04.003
That is not gonna
get Hannah back.

01:04.378 --> 01:06.174
[June] I wanted her to know
it was me.

01:14.148 --> 01:17.154
[melancholic music playing]

01:56.315 --> 01:57.317
You okay?

01:58.403 --> 01:59.823
What was she wearing?

02:02.035 --> 02:04.875
Uh, I... I... I don't remember.

02:08.006 --> 02:09.008
[Moira] I saw it.

02:10.302 --> 02:12.599
I was just on hold
with the refugee help line.

02:12.891 --> 02:14.936
Never got through, they're
probably getting swamped.

02:16.105 --> 02:17.357
What was that color?

02:17.901 --> 02:18.903
[Moira] Who the fuck knows?

02:19.236 --> 02:21.282
And what the fuck
was Mark doing with Serena?

02:21.700 --> 02:23.537
She probably made a deal
with the Americans.

02:23.662 --> 02:25.081
[Moira] Oh, fucked!

02:26.417 --> 02:27.629
What was she wearing?

02:29.089 --> 02:30.676
What the fuck was that color?

02:30.801 --> 02:32.095
I don't know. Her dress.
I've never seen

02:32.221 --> 02:35.853
that color before. It was like
a plum color. Purple.

02:36.145 --> 02:38.066
Yeah, purple.
What... what does purple mean?

02:38.191 --> 02:39.736
-I don't know.
-[Moira] I don't know.

02:39.861 --> 02:40.905
It's not pink, though.

02:41.865 --> 02:43.159
She's not a little girl anymore.

02:52.637 --> 02:53.681
Fuck.

02:56.394 --> 02:58.106
[breathing unsteadily]

02:58.732 --> 02:59.818
Nick was there.

03:00.695 --> 03:02.239
I can talk to him.
I need to talk to him.

03:02.364 --> 03:05.370
No, we can't get in contact with
him without Tuello's office.

03:08.544 --> 03:09.963
There's a group at the border.

03:11.382 --> 03:12.384
Women.

03:13.052 --> 03:14.764
Not like official but, um...

03:16.183 --> 03:17.185
I heard they've been
having some luck

03:17.311 --> 03:19.189
getting messages
to people inside.

03:23.866 --> 03:24.784
What?

03:30.128 --> 03:31.464
When the fuck were you going
to tell me about--

03:31.590 --> 03:32.925
I wasn't gonna tell you that,

03:33.552 --> 03:35.514
because I think
they're basically suicidal.

03:35.848 --> 03:38.019
They're a bunch
of fucking traumatized refugees,

03:38.144 --> 03:40.273
and they're the last people
you need to be around right now.

03:40.357 --> 03:41.943
Well, you don't get
to decide that.

03:48.081 --> 03:49.249
Fine. I'll ask them to meet.

03:51.128 --> 03:52.005
For Hannah.

03:54.636 --> 03:56.263
Just me and you, though.
No men allowed.

04:15.761 --> 04:18.182
[traffic passing]

04:49.119 --> 04:51.875
Lily? I'm Moira.

04:53.670 --> 04:54.881
June Osborn.

04:55.841 --> 04:57.177
I thought you'd be taller.

04:58.387 --> 05:00.350
[chuckles softly]
I get that a lot.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.649
[Lily] So, you need me
to send a message?

05:04.609 --> 05:07.197
If you can. To a Commander.

05:09.368 --> 05:10.370
Okay.

05:11.748 --> 05:12.750
Boston?

05:12.875 --> 05:13.877
Yeah.

05:14.921 --> 05:16.132
He a big Jezebel's guy?

05:20.766 --> 05:22.018
No. He's, um...

05:23.605 --> 05:24.607
No.

05:24.983 --> 05:26.235
[Lily] That's too bad.

05:26.570 --> 05:28.782
We have a couple girls
at the one in Boston.

05:30.368 --> 05:31.538
That's not the only way.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.046
I got to expand our network
a bit before the Eyes busted me.

05:39.052 --> 05:41.140
I'm one of the women you traded
for Waterford.

05:48.614 --> 05:49.866
Sorry I didn't do it sooner.

05:53.247 --> 05:54.751
I don't know how you managed it.

05:56.003 --> 05:56.922
Getting us out.

05:58.049 --> 05:59.217
And all those kids.

06:01.305 --> 06:02.307
I was lucky.

06:04.394 --> 06:05.438
Women always say that

06:05.564 --> 06:07.317
when they've done
something extraordinary.

06:14.498 --> 06:15.501
Follow me.

06:33.745 --> 06:34.914
[Mark] Whose crest is this?

06:36.292 --> 06:37.753
[Serena] The Brodericks, D.C.

06:39.006 --> 06:42.345
Commander Christopher Broderick?
Quite a get.

06:42.888 --> 06:44.851
It was kind of him
to take the time.

06:45.686 --> 06:48.775
Well, you put on
a big show yesterday.

06:48.859 --> 06:50.863
No surprise
leadership is grateful.

06:52.282 --> 06:53.367
Very grateful.

06:54.662 --> 06:57.501
It's a relief that Fred
is finally being shown

06:57.626 --> 06:59.463
the respect that he is due.

07:00.632 --> 07:03.220
I hope I haven't gotten you
into too much trouble

07:03.345 --> 07:04.389
at the home office.

07:04.766 --> 07:07.646
I'm sure they can't be pleased
with you for all of this.

07:07.980 --> 07:09.399
You were given dispensation

07:09.525 --> 07:11.487
to bury your husband
in his home country.

07:11.613 --> 07:13.157
The manner in which
you go about that

07:13.282 --> 07:15.746
is none of our concern,
officially.

07:16.246 --> 07:18.292
You're just here
to offer protection.

07:20.923 --> 07:24.680
Our way of apologizing for
the unfortunate miscommunication

07:24.806 --> 07:27.895
regarding Commander Waterford's
transfer into custody.

07:30.066 --> 07:33.657
And you couldn't possibly
be gathering information

07:33.782 --> 07:36.203
to take back to the Americans
or the Canadians.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.167
Not at all.

07:41.046 --> 07:42.925
Well, even so,
you shouldn't stay too long.

07:44.052 --> 07:46.098
The hotel Marthas
will be reporting back.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.941
Are you worried
about your reputation?

07:56.870 --> 07:59.166
Just wouldn't want anybody
to get the wrong idea.

08:02.338 --> 08:03.340
Right.

08:06.556 --> 08:07.766
I'll leave you to it, then.

08:09.311 --> 08:12.902
I'll be back to escort you
to Commander Lawrence's.

08:22.253 --> 08:25.259
[dramatic music playing]

09:10.224 --> 09:13.480
Can't be too careful.
It's so close to No Man's Land.

09:14.274 --> 09:16.361
[woman] Hey. Here, come on.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.871
This is Moira and June Osborn.

09:21.664 --> 09:22.833
They were both in Boston.

09:23.877 --> 09:25.171
June did Angels' Flight.

09:45.378 --> 09:47.841
Come on,
we'll message my contact.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.388
We can get past
Gilead's cell tower surveillance

09:50.514 --> 09:52.601
with sat phones,
but it's a slow process.

09:52.851 --> 09:54.814
Gonna take a while to get down
the chain to your guy.

09:59.155 --> 10:02.161
[static buzzing over radio]

10:06.629 --> 10:07.673
[Moira] What is this?

10:09.426 --> 10:11.096
[Lily] Everyone we've been able
to get out.

10:11.597 --> 10:13.560
Or a lot of them, anyway.

10:18.068 --> 10:19.237
This is incredible.

10:22.368 --> 10:23.580
[Lily] Don't be too impressed.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.253
Here's who we've lost
over the years.

10:39.194 --> 10:40.196
I'm sorry.

10:40.947 --> 10:41.949
I am too.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.582
But everyone working with Mayday
knows the stakes.

10:53.848 --> 10:54.892
Mayday?

10:55.769 --> 10:56.813
Mayday.

10:57.648 --> 10:58.775
Mayday's in Canada?

11:00.695 --> 11:01.739
Mayday's everywhere.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.369
Wait, how have you
not been caught?

11:05.622 --> 11:08.586
There's no, you know,
flag or anything.

11:09.003 --> 11:11.551
It's outposts. Small, like this.

11:12.218 --> 11:14.515
Families, sometimes.
Just people.

11:15.182 --> 11:16.936
People who are trying
to do some good.

11:17.270 --> 11:18.690
[Moira] And they're all along
the border?

11:19.315 --> 11:20.359
[Lily] No idea.

11:20.694 --> 11:22.029
It's safer that way
for everyone.

11:23.448 --> 11:25.452
Most of my circle
are still inside.

11:26.288 --> 11:27.373
I was a Martha.

11:28.208 --> 11:30.254
We got our information out
through this place.

11:30.755 --> 11:32.008
Mayday sent back weapons,

11:32.133 --> 11:34.972
explosives,
stuff to make some trouble.

11:35.974 --> 11:38.437
And if you were caught
and totally fucked,

11:39.523 --> 11:41.443
they were the ones who would
at least try to get you out.

11:43.405 --> 11:44.658
This was my Mayday.

11:51.004 --> 11:52.256
We thought we made it up.

11:56.641 --> 11:57.934
We thought it wasn't real.

11:59.938 --> 12:01.776
We thought we made it up
'cause we had to.

12:04.364 --> 12:07.036
Well, then,
you were Mayday too.

12:11.796 --> 12:14.467
Anyway, like I said,
it'll be a bit of a wait

12:14.593 --> 12:15.804
to get word to your Commander.

12:20.312 --> 12:21.398
[laughing]

12:22.776 --> 12:27.284
Mrs. Waterford. Mr. Tuello.
The dynamic duo.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.707
Commander Lawrence,
blessed evening.

12:29.915 --> 12:33.296
Ah, it is now.
Uh, your friends await.

12:33.422 --> 12:34.842
The guest of honor.

12:37.263 --> 12:42.273
We have a strict
"no spies allowed" policy.

12:43.108 --> 12:44.068
No hard feelings.

12:44.444 --> 12:46.281
No. None... none at all.

12:46.406 --> 12:49.830
But perhaps you'll find a time
to join me for a chat later.

12:49.955 --> 12:51.458
I think we have a lot
to talk about.

12:51.751 --> 12:53.211
[laughing]

12:54.172 --> 12:55.174
All right.

13:06.154 --> 13:07.364
Serena.

13:08.743 --> 13:10.496
My deepest condolences.

13:10.663 --> 13:12.082
Thank you, Commander Mackenzie.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.212
I believe you know my wife?

13:14.755 --> 13:15.757
[Serena] Yes, a little.

13:16.132 --> 13:17.511
It's lovely to see you again.

13:17.636 --> 13:20.057
I'm so sorry
it's under these circumstances.

13:20.182 --> 13:23.523
It's a balm to have given him
the send-off that he deserves.

13:23.648 --> 13:24.983
[Commander Mackenzie]
Well, blessed be.

13:26.027 --> 13:27.739
Of course, we would have
preferred to have given

13:27.864 --> 13:29.743
a fair trial, as well,

13:29.868 --> 13:31.831
as Commander Lawrence
attempted to arrange.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.713
It's terribly unfortunate

13:35.839 --> 13:38.385
that Ms. Osborn was able
to intercede.

13:41.934 --> 13:43.103
You... you know?

13:43.604 --> 13:45.190
She couldn't have done it alone.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.781
And from our understanding,
she had quite a bit of help.

13:49.950 --> 13:52.789
The Americans, strange.

13:52.914 --> 13:54.960
You'd expect
their diminished status

13:55.085 --> 13:57.047
would restrain
their odd affection

13:57.172 --> 14:01.472
for political assassinations.
But, tradition, I suppose.

14:04.437 --> 14:07.276
-[Commander Mackenzie] Rose!
-[laughs] Mrs. Mackenzie!

14:07.401 --> 14:08.529
[Mrs. Mackenzie] It's so good
to see you.

14:08.654 --> 14:10.324
-[Rose] It's been too long.
-We would hate to miss a chance

14:10.449 --> 14:13.539
to see Rosie or a chance to get
to meet her new husband.

14:14.791 --> 14:15.877
[Nick] Thanks for including me.

14:18.674 --> 14:21.471
I believe you already know
the Commander, Serena?

14:21.597 --> 14:23.559
Yes, Nick's an old friend.

14:24.519 --> 14:26.523
I haven't had the chance
to meet Mrs. Blaine.

14:26.649 --> 14:28.653
Rose, please, Mrs. Waterford.

14:28.778 --> 14:30.865
My husband speaks of you
with the greatest respect.

14:30.990 --> 14:32.326
[Serena] Does he? [chuckles]

14:33.203 --> 14:35.667
Well, tell me, how did you two
find each other?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.754
We met a few months ago.

14:38.088 --> 14:40.008
Nick was in D.C. on business.

14:40.425 --> 14:43.975
It was love at third mutually
attended gala. [chuckles]

14:44.100 --> 14:45.687
I've always enjoyed talking
to Rose.

14:46.187 --> 14:47.732
What a lovely thing to say.

14:49.068 --> 14:50.655
[Serena] And how lucky
that you two were able

14:50.780 --> 14:53.536
to stumble upon
such a wonderful match.

14:54.453 --> 14:55.915
I've been blessed.

14:57.334 --> 14:58.504
For the baby.

14:59.046 --> 15:00.340
Congratulations.

15:01.927 --> 15:03.346
[Rose] It's just
a little sweater.

15:03.597 --> 15:04.933
I hope you don't mind
a few lumps.

15:05.058 --> 15:06.645
I'm still terrible at knitting.

15:06.770 --> 15:08.023
Oh, you should see
the first one.

15:08.231 --> 15:10.570
-No one should have to see that.
-[chuckles]

15:11.279 --> 15:12.741
Well, thank you for the effort.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.880
Ah, dinner. Shall we?

15:24.556 --> 15:27.562
[eerie ambient music playing]

15:34.534 --> 15:37.832
[machines beeping]

16:25.845 --> 16:28.976
[sobs, shouts]

16:37.326 --> 16:39.831
[sobbing softly]

16:48.599 --> 16:49.726
I...

16:51.062 --> 16:57.032
[breathing heavily]

17:01.290 --> 17:04.338
[sobbing]

17:33.396 --> 17:34.983
Dear God!

17:35.483 --> 17:38.991
[sobbing]

17:42.039 --> 17:45.086
Sh... she does not deserve this.

17:46.464 --> 17:49.345
You know she does not
deserve this!

17:50.138 --> 17:54.188
I... I know you...
I know you're unhappy with

17:55.650 --> 17:59.239
my behavior sometimes.
I... I've lost my temper.

17:59.323 --> 18:03.791
I... I've made ch... choices.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.713
I... I... I...
I've made choices.

18:07.297 --> 18:09.009
Oh, I... I... I was trying

18:09.134 --> 18:14.269
to k... k... k... keep
my... my... my girls safe.

18:16.733 --> 18:18.444
Surely you understand that.

18:19.405 --> 18:21.910
Please do not
p... p... punish her.

18:22.411 --> 18:24.582
Please do not punish her
to teach me a lesson.

18:24.707 --> 18:27.462
I... I... I...
I will turn things around!

18:27.880 --> 18:30.343
I can turn things around!
I will.

18:30.553 --> 18:33.976
I... I... I will
do things differently.

18:36.313 --> 18:37.734
I will do things differently.

18:39.319 --> 18:42.702
I promise you. I promise you.

18:48.379 --> 18:49.465
Please.

18:56.479 --> 18:59.359
I was reading some briefings
this morning,

18:59.485 --> 19:02.867
very, very positive feedback
on the funeral broadcast.

19:02.992 --> 19:05.873
Mm. An impressive
initial showing. Mm.

19:06.625 --> 19:09.506
We should consider
trial ballooning

19:09.631 --> 19:12.803
a new export strategy
to Europe maybe--

19:12.929 --> 19:15.976
We will discuss it all
in the Council meeting tomorrow.

19:16.268 --> 19:19.609
Joseph, you're boring the ladies
with shop talk.

19:19.734 --> 19:21.863
[all chuckle]

19:21.988 --> 19:24.117
I apologize.
If it's any consolation, ladies,

19:24.243 --> 19:26.247
-I bore myself.
-[all chuckle]

19:26.372 --> 19:28.376
After you remarry
you'll have someone

19:28.502 --> 19:31.215
to steer dinner table
conversation again.

19:31.340 --> 19:32.885
Men aren't adept at the art.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.603
I have, uh, no plans to remarry.

19:38.814 --> 19:39.816
[Commander Mackenzie]
We'll discuss

19:39.941 --> 19:40.985
that later, as well.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.824
A single man has no place
in leadership.

19:50.796 --> 19:53.760
It was such a pleasure
to see Agnes yesterday.

19:54.386 --> 19:56.265
I'm so very grateful,

19:56.390 --> 19:59.021
appreciative for your family
coming all this way.

19:59.522 --> 20:00.774
[Commander Mackenzie]
To pay our respects.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.697
And quite honestly,
to speak to you

20:03.822 --> 20:05.993
about our mutual adversary.

20:07.412 --> 20:09.584
We had hoped when Ms. Osborn
was in Toronto,

20:09.709 --> 20:11.504
things would finally
settle down, but--

20:11.630 --> 20:13.508
Oh, she's never going to stop.

20:14.259 --> 20:16.388
No. It doesn't seem she will.

20:17.934 --> 20:19.687
And she was able to get to Fred,

20:19.812 --> 20:23.194
I am afraid, that with the help
of the Americans,

20:23.319 --> 20:25.950
she might be able to extend
her reach to our family.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.999
I've come to regret
my former interventions

20:30.124 --> 20:31.168
on her behalf.

20:34.759 --> 20:37.472
We would never want Agnes
to find out something horrible

20:37.598 --> 20:38.767
had happened
to her birth mother.

20:39.936 --> 20:41.480
To traumatize her like that.

20:42.817 --> 20:43.902
It's one
of God's great mysteries

20:44.027 --> 20:47.117
how our sweet angel came
from that devil of a woman.

20:49.246 --> 20:52.586
[Commander Mackenzie] Yes, well,
we led with sentiment,

20:52.712 --> 20:54.632
in all the mercy
that we've shown her.

20:55.425 --> 20:56.928
[sighs]

20:57.053 --> 20:58.849
But Agnes is strong,

20:59.767 --> 21:02.523
and she will be able
to understand, when she has to.

21:06.155 --> 21:07.867
June Osborn is a cancer.

21:08.910 --> 21:10.204
We have to cut her out.

21:19.306 --> 21:21.477
[people chattering]

21:24.274 --> 21:25.318
[Sam] Thanks for helping out.

21:26.445 --> 21:27.615
[June] Of course.

21:29.911 --> 21:30.996
[Sam] That's nice work.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.294
So, what else do you guys
sew in here

21:34.419 --> 21:35.631
besides maps and stuff?

21:37.050 --> 21:38.344
[Sam] I dunno, depends.

21:38.637 --> 21:41.601
Yours is gonna get
some powdered arsenic.

21:41.893 --> 21:44.565
We're hoping to kill
a D.C. Commander next week.

21:45.776 --> 21:49.784
Arsenic is a, uh,
terrible way to go.

21:54.334 --> 21:55.336
Good.

22:00.806 --> 22:02.893
-[man] Don't fucking shoot!
-[woman] Drop the fucking gun!

22:03.018 --> 22:04.146
[man] Do not shoot!

22:06.191 --> 22:08.028
[woman] Don't fucking move!
Drop the fucking gun!

22:08.154 --> 22:09.406
-[man] Please!
-[woman] Drop your weapon!

22:09.532 --> 22:12.370
You drop your fucking weapon!
I'm a friend! I'm a friend!

22:12.495 --> 22:13.497
Where's Mike?

22:13.623 --> 22:15.586
He couldn't come. He sent me.
He told me the code.

22:15.711 --> 22:16.796
All right, if you know the code,

22:16.921 --> 22:18.633
"There were crimson roses
on the bench. "

22:19.635 --> 22:20.804
Just give me a second to think.

22:20.971 --> 22:22.766
[Lily] "There were crimson roses
on the bench!"

22:22.892 --> 22:24.729
[girl] Jonah! "They looked like
splashes of blood."

22:24.854 --> 22:26.733
It's, "They looked like
splashes of blood."

22:26.858 --> 22:27.860
[Lily] Rachel!

22:28.402 --> 22:30.323
Please don't hurt him.
He's my friend.

22:30.448 --> 22:32.285
[Lily] Okay, okay.
You're safe now.

22:34.832 --> 22:35.834
[exhales in relief]

22:36.669 --> 22:38.965
[Rachel] Thank you,
for everything.

22:39.424 --> 22:40.426
[man] Go in grace.

22:41.971 --> 22:44.977
Hey. We're so glad
that you're here. It's okay.

22:45.729 --> 22:47.733
[woman] Rachel, your family's
been looking for you.

22:47.858 --> 22:49.695
Okay. And thanks.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.242
Hey.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.751
You're going back in?

22:57.670 --> 22:58.672
[man] Yeah.

23:00.132 --> 23:02.011
Before I'm missed.
I've got a wife and a kid.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.436
Can't leave them behind.

23:29.399 --> 23:30.819
Hey, just give me
a second, okay?

23:30.944 --> 23:32.030
Okay. Be careful.

23:42.383 --> 23:43.427
[Mark] Commander Blaine.

23:44.638 --> 23:47.018
Hey. Listen, I'd, uh,

23:48.730 --> 23:50.567
I'd like to be the one
to tell June about her.

23:52.028 --> 23:53.030
Rose.

23:56.078 --> 23:57.748
-Sure.
-Okay.

23:59.502 --> 24:00.879
[Mark] Have you given
any more thought

24:00.962 --> 24:02.800
to our, uh, conversation?

24:05.806 --> 24:08.520
Yeah. No.
I... I can't do that right now.

24:11.399 --> 24:12.736
Good evening, Commander.

24:13.237 --> 24:14.782
Do you two have a lot
to talk about?

24:15.032 --> 24:16.034
No, sir.

24:17.871 --> 24:19.415
You know, it's disrespectful
to leave your wife

24:19.542 --> 24:20.836
standing out in the cold.

24:22.380 --> 24:23.465
Could you excuse us?

24:25.010 --> 24:26.054
Of course.

24:30.062 --> 24:31.983
Rose's father is an old friend.

24:32.985 --> 24:35.489
I certainly hope
that High Commander Wharton's

24:35.615 --> 24:37.619
position had nothing to do
with her appeal

24:37.744 --> 24:40.040
for a young Commander
rising through the ranks.

24:42.128 --> 24:43.172
'Course not.

24:44.299 --> 24:45.844
[Commander Mackenzie]
I'm keeping my eye on you.

24:46.219 --> 24:47.388
Make sure you treat her right.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.602
[Nick] Yes, sir.

24:51.313 --> 24:52.315
[clears throat]

24:53.818 --> 24:55.947
[exhales] Fuck.

24:58.786 --> 25:00.707
Eleanor was quite the presence.

25:02.210 --> 25:05.132
The house must feel
very empty without her.

25:07.971 --> 25:09.015
It does.

25:11.854 --> 25:13.106
I always liked her.

25:16.029 --> 25:19.912
Can't say she felt the same,
sorry to say.

25:20.204 --> 25:21.289
[chuckles]

25:22.208 --> 25:24.838
Well, women have never
been particularly fond of me.

25:24.964 --> 25:27.719
I... I can't imagine why.

25:36.027 --> 25:37.990
Fred should never
have done that to you.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.210
No, he shouldn't have.

25:45.129 --> 25:47.509
[Lawrence] He was a weak man,

25:48.886 --> 25:53.478
overcompensated
for... toxic masculinity.

25:55.190 --> 25:59.575
My students loved
that term, before.

26:01.620 --> 26:05.879
I'm beginning to wonder
if it isn't... a blessing

26:06.004 --> 26:08.425
that he won't be around
to raise our child.

26:11.599 --> 26:14.730
I loved Fred, but a boy
needs a strong father

26:14.855 --> 26:16.274
to guide him in this life.

26:17.652 --> 26:19.656
My husband made
so many mistakes.

26:23.873 --> 26:26.587
Um, I'm sure you'll have
better luck next time.

26:32.348 --> 26:33.518
Mackenzie's right.

26:35.980 --> 26:39.153
An unmarried man in Gilead
has limited influence.

26:44.998 --> 26:48.171
Marrying for power, Serena,

26:48.296 --> 26:51.386
doesn't... doesn't always
work out well.

26:54.100 --> 26:55.310
Depends on the marriage.

27:01.364 --> 27:02.366
Oh!

27:05.122 --> 27:07.627
He's become very active
after meals.

27:07.752 --> 27:10.466
[chuckles]

27:11.050 --> 27:12.052
Oh.

27:18.858 --> 27:21.906
We're going
to protect you, Serena.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.116
You and your child.

27:26.916 --> 27:28.376
Ooh, ooh. [chuckles]

27:31.592 --> 27:33.094
Praise be. [chuckles]

27:40.359 --> 27:41.862
[footsteps approaching]

27:54.721 --> 27:55.765
[clears throat]

27:56.432 --> 27:58.813
[Aunt Lydia] Oh, Mrs. Putnam.

27:59.690 --> 28:01.317
God bless you for coming.

28:01.902 --> 28:03.948
I wasn't given much of a choice,
was I?

28:05.200 --> 28:07.329
Ah. Nevertheless, I...

28:08.583 --> 28:11.462
I seem to recall it made
such a difference having Janine

28:11.589 --> 28:15.429
at the hospital
when dear Angela was suffering.

28:17.767 --> 28:18.769
I suppose.

28:20.272 --> 28:21.482
[Aunt Lydia] The doctors aren't,
uh...

28:23.361 --> 28:24.363
too optimistic.

28:27.621 --> 28:30.668
I'm sorry, Lydia.
She was a blessing.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.924
Is a blessing! She'll recover.

28:34.801 --> 28:35.845
Of course.

28:40.563 --> 28:43.778
Do you want to say hi?
You wanna say hi?

28:45.782 --> 28:49.413
[melancholic music playing]

28:53.506 --> 28:54.841
Say hi.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.752
I'll make sure
that Angela grows up to know

29:12.877 --> 29:14.631
where she got
her beautiful smile.

29:19.014 --> 29:20.768
And her sweet nature.

29:23.566 --> 29:24.568
Yeah.

29:26.989 --> 29:28.283
[Naomi] You won't be forgotten.

29:28.408 --> 29:30.412
[clears throat, sniffles]

29:37.927 --> 29:41.142
Well, I'd say thanks
for a lovely evening,

29:41.267 --> 29:43.313
but I can't say I'd mean it.

29:43.438 --> 29:45.777
[chuckles] I'm sorry about that.
I thought that they would

29:45.902 --> 29:47.697
at least have put you
somewhere inside.

29:47.822 --> 29:49.576
[chuckles] Ah, yes.

29:49.701 --> 29:53.124
I... I had hoped to catch up
to Commander Lawrence,

29:53.249 --> 29:55.253
but it's to be expected.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.842
Men in power
can't resist showing everyone

29:57.967 --> 29:59.846
just how much power they have.

30:01.683 --> 30:03.646
It's been interesting,
being here.

30:04.523 --> 30:07.570
I spent so many years
studying this country.

30:08.906 --> 30:10.408
Is it different
than you expected?

30:11.870 --> 30:13.958
Not particularly. No. [chuckles]

30:15.085 --> 30:17.715
Surface-level beauty
doing its best to paper over

30:17.841 --> 30:20.262
a stunning amount of hypocrisy.

30:23.561 --> 30:26.315
It's a shame that you can't see
all that we've done right here.

30:32.411 --> 30:33.413
Good night, Serena.

30:33.539 --> 30:35.835
Actually, um, there is something

30:35.960 --> 30:38.131
that I would like to discuss
with you, if you have a minute?

30:52.660 --> 30:54.956
Something that can't wait
until we get home tomorrow?

30:57.419 --> 30:58.589
I am home.

31:01.637 --> 31:02.639
What?

31:04.224 --> 31:05.686
My place is here.

31:08.107 --> 31:11.447
There are so many things
that I want to accomplish.

31:12.199 --> 31:13.702
I want to stay here.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.376
You're finally a free woman.

31:17.501 --> 31:20.508
Are you sure you want to...
throw that away?

31:28.691 --> 31:30.402
I want to thank you
for everything

31:30.528 --> 31:31.738
that you've done for me.

31:38.585 --> 31:39.587
It was my job.

31:40.798 --> 31:41.842
Still.

32:07.894 --> 32:12.862
Serena, staying here
would be a mistake.

32:17.997 --> 32:19.458
I'm sorry you feel that way.

32:21.087 --> 32:24.426
You must realize it's not safe
for women in this place.

32:25.846 --> 32:27.558
Especially unmarried women.

32:27.767 --> 32:30.689
I don't believe that will
be my situation for much longer.

32:32.777 --> 32:34.363
What, you've made plans
to remarry?

32:34.488 --> 32:38.162
Uh, no. I'm...
I'm still in mourning.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.043
[knocking on door]

32:42.922 --> 32:44.091
Come in!

32:47.557 --> 32:48.976
Good evening, Mrs. Waterford.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.688
Your presence
is requested tomorrow

32:50.813 --> 32:52.775
at the Council, eleven o'clock.

32:53.276 --> 32:54.696
May I confirm your attendance?

32:54.821 --> 32:55.990
Of course.

32:56.533 --> 32:58.244
Did Commander Lawrence
call the meeting?

32:58.829 --> 32:59.956
[messenger] I'm not sure, ma'am.

33:00.081 --> 33:01.793
The order just came down
from the Council.

33:03.797 --> 33:04.799
Thank you.

33:15.905 --> 33:16.948
Goodbye, Serena.

33:20.079 --> 33:21.081
Stay safe.

33:27.302 --> 33:28.304
[door closes]

33:31.101 --> 33:32.312
[rain pattering]

33:33.982 --> 33:34.984
[Lily] June.

33:37.782 --> 33:39.577
[June] Yeah. Thank you.

33:47.802 --> 33:48.804
Nick?

33:51.267 --> 33:53.897
-[Nick] June. Hi.
-[sighs]

33:57.487 --> 33:58.699
Hi.

34:00.326 --> 34:01.663
It's so good to hear your voice.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.293
[Nick] You too.

34:07.048 --> 34:09.386
Hannah's safe. I didn't get
to talk to her, but she's okay.

34:10.054 --> 34:11.140
[exhales]

34:13.520 --> 34:14.689
Is she with Serena?

34:16.651 --> 34:19.323
Uh, no. Not since the funeral.

34:20.909 --> 34:23.707
The purple color Hannah
was wearing.

34:23.832 --> 34:24.834
What does it mean?

34:27.213 --> 34:28.257
[Nick] It means she's ready.

34:30.888 --> 34:31.931
Ready for what?

34:33.142 --> 34:34.227
New school.

34:35.271 --> 34:38.779
High Commanders' daughters
training for future wives.

34:39.947 --> 34:40.949
[exhales sharply]

34:43.538 --> 34:44.540
Wives?

34:46.795 --> 34:48.047
[Nick] They're just preparing
them now.

34:48.130 --> 34:49.967
There's no further plans,
as far as I know.

34:51.930 --> 34:54.560
But she'll be all right.
She's tough, like you.

34:54.685 --> 35:00.321
And the Mackenzies,
they really love her.

35:03.077 --> 35:05.708
They love her so much
they're sending a 12-year-old

35:05.833 --> 35:06.918
to a Wife School?

35:09.674 --> 35:10.884
I'm sorry I can't do more.

35:12.387 --> 35:13.890
[June] Um, maybe you c...

35:15.686 --> 35:17.732
I know it's a lot to ask,
but maybe you could transfer

35:17.857 --> 35:21.321
to her district.
You can watch out for her.

35:22.449 --> 35:24.161
-Please?
-[Nick] I wish I could.

35:24.286 --> 35:25.371
But there's...

35:26.624 --> 35:28.169
[exhales]

35:31.175 --> 35:32.427
I have obligations now.

35:34.097 --> 35:35.183
New obligations.

35:38.189 --> 35:39.357
I have a wife.

35:42.447 --> 35:43.950
You know how things are here.

35:46.623 --> 35:47.875
Yeah.

35:52.342 --> 35:53.344
Who is she?

35:54.639 --> 35:55.933
Her name is Rose.

35:58.229 --> 35:59.356
I told her about you.

36:04.032 --> 36:06.119
Would I like her? [chuckles]

36:06.495 --> 36:09.125
Yeah. Yeah, you actually would.

36:13.342 --> 36:14.386
How's Nichole?

36:14.637 --> 36:17.141
[June] Beautiful.
She's so smart.

36:18.728 --> 36:20.983
She loves the little doll
that you gave her.

36:24.615 --> 36:26.661
[Nick] Listen, June.
You gotta be safe.

36:27.245 --> 36:28.623
Mackenzie, he's powerful.

36:30.544 --> 36:33.299
You gotta keep yourself safe.
Keep Nichole safe. Promise me.

36:36.054 --> 36:37.223
I promise, I will.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.524
We won't be able to talk again
for a while. I'm sorry.

36:44.905 --> 36:46.283
No, I'm just...

36:48.162 --> 36:49.289
I mean...

36:51.836 --> 36:52.880
I understand.

37:00.896 --> 37:02.190
Hey, Nick.

37:06.824 --> 37:08.202
Try and be happy, okay?

37:29.870 --> 37:33.545
[breathing unsteadily]

38:02.895 --> 38:04.022
[Aunt Lydia] Where did
they take her?

38:04.523 --> 38:05.692
[doctor speaks indistinctly]

38:10.869 --> 38:12.371
[doctor] She woke up
a few hours ago.

38:13.081 --> 38:14.627
She's made some improvements.

38:15.796 --> 38:17.549
Fresh air will do her good.

38:27.820 --> 38:31.201
[breathing gently]

38:44.854 --> 38:48.611
-[door closing]
-[footsteps approaching]

38:48.862 --> 38:50.364
[Lawrence sighs]

38:50.489 --> 38:51.617
[Serena] Good morning.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.584
Were you the one
who called the meeting?

38:57.504 --> 38:59.132
[Lawrence] Uh, no. No.

39:00.259 --> 39:03.432
[Serena] Oh. Is, um,
something the matter?

39:04.392 --> 39:05.604
[sighs]

39:06.271 --> 39:07.315
No.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.945
You seem different.

39:12.491 --> 39:18.504
Serena, do you have some kind
of expectation of me?

39:22.512 --> 39:23.848
No, of course not.

39:26.646 --> 39:27.814
[door opening]

39:35.872 --> 39:37.083
I'm sorry, Serena.

40:12.863 --> 40:15.075
[Commander Mackenzie]
Serena, blessed day.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.375
Blessed day, High Commanders.

40:20.545 --> 40:22.048
[Commander Mackenzie]
We have given your future

40:22.173 --> 40:24.135
a great deal of consideration.

40:28.936 --> 40:30.147
It's good news.

40:32.151 --> 40:34.990
It's an exciting opportunity,
to be useful.

40:39.373 --> 40:41.545
We'd like you
to lend your expertise

40:41.670 --> 40:45.344
as we expand the influence
of our great nation.

40:46.471 --> 40:50.396
You'll be acting
as a global ambassador of sorts.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.736
Unofficially, of course.

40:55.405 --> 40:56.659
But we thought
it would be a positive

40:56.784 --> 40:59.832
to have such a capable,
impressive woman

41:00.332 --> 41:02.461
speaking on our behalf.

41:06.469 --> 41:08.766
So you won't be making a place
for me here.

41:09.935 --> 41:14.068
I... We want you in Toronto.

41:15.028 --> 41:17.576
To best represent
our sacred republic.

41:21.667 --> 41:26.217
You're an unusual woman, Serena,

41:26.342 --> 41:29.307
and we don't have

41:29.432 --> 41:34.108
the... proper infrastructure

41:34.233 --> 41:38.366
for unusual women
to live within our borders.

41:46.382 --> 41:47.886
I'll require a staff.

41:50.057 --> 41:51.100
Certainly.

41:52.228 --> 41:53.689
And a substantial budget.

41:54.273 --> 41:55.317
[Commander Mackenzie] Mm.

41:55.985 --> 41:57.614
And protection from those

41:58.824 --> 42:02.164
who would hurt me and my baby.

42:04.085 --> 42:05.087
Absolutely.

42:05.964 --> 42:08.636
Don't worry.
Leadership is very invested

42:08.761 --> 42:10.222
in making this a success.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.111
Thank you.

42:30.513 --> 42:35.314
[airplane engines powering up]

42:35.439 --> 42:37.777
[airplane engines whirring]

42:48.924 --> 42:50.344
They had us hold the plane.

42:52.348 --> 42:53.475
Change of heart?

43:10.217 --> 43:12.346
We're just right back
where we started.

43:20.195 --> 43:23.828
How am I supposed to keep
my baby girl safe from here?

43:26.750 --> 43:28.420
How am I supposed to do that?

43:31.593 --> 43:32.929
She's one-quarter Holly...

43:35.016 --> 43:36.394
and she's one-half you.

43:39.233 --> 43:40.485
She's gonna be okay.

43:41.697 --> 43:42.991
She's not gonna be a wife.

43:44.828 --> 43:46.372
That is not fucking happening.

43:50.715 --> 43:54.639
I'm gonna go, um...
I'm gonna go get our stuff.

43:54.765 --> 43:56.643
We should get back.
She is going to be okay.

43:57.352 --> 43:58.647
'Kay. Thanks.

44:10.253 --> 44:11.548
June?

44:12.174 --> 44:14.011
The Americans
are escorting Serena Waterford

44:14.136 --> 44:15.222
back into Toronto.

44:16.683 --> 44:20.566
[sniffling]

44:23.154 --> 44:24.741
She's coming back?

44:26.202 --> 44:27.371
[Lily] Private airport.

44:41.942 --> 44:43.361
[Mark] They'll walk you back
to the car.

44:45.031 --> 44:46.952
Back to the Detention Center
for now.

45:00.813 --> 45:01.815
[sighs]

45:41.687 --> 45:43.649
Looks like you have some fans,
Mrs. Waterford.

45:44.483 --> 45:45.903
Servants of God.

45:48.282 --> 45:50.203
We're all here
to spread His word.

46:07.655 --> 46:09.033
What's going on?

46:09.283 --> 46:11.454
[driver] I don't know.
They're not moving.

46:20.305 --> 46:21.307
[gasps]

46:23.186 --> 46:26.400
Never touch my daughter again.

46:27.862 --> 46:28.906
Drive the car.

46:29.114 --> 46:31.953
Never touch my daughter again.

46:32.204 --> 46:34.291
Drive the car! Back it up now!
