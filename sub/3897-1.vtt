02:38.224 --> 02:39.858
<i>Hello.</i>

02:39.860 --> 02:41.527
This is Thomas Lang.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.462
<i>Hi. Are you...
Are you in Rome?</i>

02:43.464 --> 02:45.230
- Yes.
<i>- Oh, great.</i>

02:45.665 --> 02:47.266
<i>We should meet.</i>

02:47.268 --> 02:49.001
Okay. Where?

02:49.003 --> 02:51.303
<i>Um, we could meet
at Cafe Rosati.</i>

02:51.305 --> 02:52.985
<i>- It's near your hotel.</i>
- Uh-huh.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.340
<i>I'll be carrying
a copy of your book.</i>

03:00.446 --> 03:01.847
Good likeness?

03:02.815 --> 03:03.882
Not bad.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.084
- I'm Thomas.
- Hi. Simone.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.486
<i>Good to meet you.</i>

03:10.190 --> 03:12.090
- Have you lived here long?
- Fifteen years.

03:12.992 --> 03:15.627
<i>Grazie.</i> This is home now.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.863
It's not enough money for
foreign press bureaus, so...

03:17.865 --> 03:23.068
I cover, um,
Italy for <i> Newsweek,</i>
<i>Daily Beast,</i> CNN, BBC.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.103
- You must be good.
- I do okay.

03:25.738 --> 03:26.939
You've got family here?

03:26.941 --> 03:29.007
Yeah. Two young boys.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.542
And a husband.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.379
I was sent your book.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.981
Thought I was going to hate it.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.116
True crime isn't really
my thing.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.085
I was flying to New York
on the red-eye,

03:40.087 --> 03:42.554
couldn't sleep, so I read
your book instead.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.122
Take that as a compliment.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.857
Like it says on the cover,

03:45.859 --> 03:47.019
"Every parent's nightmare."

03:48.061 --> 03:49.962
- You have children?
- Daughter.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.231
I'm separated from her mother.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.533
I know.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.635
How old's your daughter?

03:57.637 --> 04:00.205
- She's nine.
- And what's her name?

04:00.207 --> 04:02.174
Bea. We call her Bea.

04:03.109 --> 04:04.776
Short for Beatrice.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.311
She was conceived in Italy.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.193
Her mom was acting
in a film here.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.349
It's a nice name.

04:10.917 --> 04:11.984
Yes.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.153
So, tomorrow's the end
of the appeal.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.189
Yes, round two begins.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.457
We'll need to leave
really early.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.858
Can you be at my apartment
by 7:00?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.360
Sure.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.195
But one piece of advice.

04:23.197 --> 04:25.864
If you're going to make
the film, make it a fiction.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.600
You can't tell the truth,
unless you make it a fiction.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.770
There are so many things
I couldn't put in my book
even though they were true.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.838
Okay.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.392
<i>In September, 2007,</i>

04:53.394 --> 04:56.828
<i>two young women arrived at
the university town of Siena.</i>

04:56.830 --> 04:58.497
<i>They were looking forward
with excitement</i>

04:58.499 --> 05:00.579
<i>to spending a year as
a student in Italy.</i>

05:01.367 --> 05:03.235
<i>Elizabeth Pryce and
Jessica Fuller,</i>

05:03.237 --> 05:05.070
<i>both rented rooms in this house,</i>

05:05.072 --> 05:07.606
<i>on the edge
of the medieval town.</i>

05:07.608 --> 05:10.275
<i>Two months later,
Elizabeth was dead,</i>

05:10.277 --> 05:12.644
<i>and Jessica had been accused
of her murder,</i>

05:12.646 --> 05:14.846
<i>along with her boyfriend,
Carlo Elias.</i>

05:16.015 --> 05:18.183
<i>The case made headlines
around the world,</i>

05:18.185 --> 05:19.685
<i>and the focus of attention</i>

05:19.687 --> 05:22.454
<i>was the character of
Jessica Fuller.</i>

05:22.456 --> 05:24.022
<i>Was she the cunning manipulator</i>

05:24.024 --> 05:25.691
<i>described by the prosecution?</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:31.163
<i>The quirky student
described by her mother...</i>

05:31.165 --> 05:33.365
She's smart. She's artistic.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.067
She's imaginative.

05:35.069 --> 05:39.604
<i>...or "Jessica Rabbit,"</i>
<i>as described</i>
<i>by the British media.</i>

05:39.606 --> 05:41.740
<i>A sexy, drug-taking
student killer.</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:47.112
<i>On Halloween, Jessica
was working in Bar Rumba,</i>

05:47.114 --> 05:49.014
<i>while Elizabeth partied
late into the night</i>

05:49.016 --> 05:50.248
<i>with some English friends.</i>

05:52.018 --> 05:54.519
<i>Elizabeth spent the next day
recovering.</i>

05:54.521 --> 05:58.123
<i>The last time she was
seen alive was 8:45 p.m.</i>

06:00.326 --> 06:03.695
<i>No one knows exactly
what happened after that.</i>

06:03.697 --> 06:05.597
<i>The only thing known for certain</i>

06:05.599 --> 06:08.467
<i>is Elizabeth died a brutal
and horrible death.</i>

06:11.971 --> 06:13.405
<i>One year later,</i>

06:13.407 --> 06:16.141
<i>the families
of Elizabeth and Jessica</i>

06:16.143 --> 06:19.044
<i>- were in court
to hear the verdict.</i>

06:33.526 --> 06:35.927
<i>Hello.</i>

06:36.863 --> 06:39.297
<i>Who's there?</i>
Is Bea there?

06:39.299 --> 06:41.466
- This is Thomas.
<i>- Who is it?</i>

06:41.468 --> 06:44.002
- Thomas, we...
- No. Bea is out with her mum.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.671
Okay. Then I'll try again
tomorrow.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.353
- Okay, bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.544
You must know this road well.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.579
Yeah, every week for a year.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.382
Up to Siena on Thursday
and back on Saturday.

06:57.384 --> 07:00.819
Crazy Italian legal system
totally fucked up our lives.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.821
You were covering
this story from the beginning?

07:02.823 --> 07:04.256
Yeah. Pretty much.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.858
I was due to go to Modena
to test drive a Maserati,

07:06.860 --> 07:09.094
when ANSA,
the Italian wire service,

07:09.096 --> 07:11.897
said that an English student
had been murdered in Siena.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.166
<i>Well, I decided to
go take a look.</i>

07:14.168 --> 07:15.834
<i>I knew an Italian
journalist based there</i>

07:15.836 --> 07:18.703
<i>for</i> Corriere Della Sera,
<i>Roberto Feluci.</i>

07:21.541 --> 07:23.141
<i>Look, it's Maria Argento,</i>

07:23.810 --> 07:25.610
<i>head of the local homicide.</i>

07:25.612 --> 07:28.346
That's Polizia,
not Carabinieri?

07:28.348 --> 07:31.349
I know.
Carabinieri are furious.

07:31.351 --> 07:34.986
We're getting bits and pieces
of information, but we do know
that the victim's name

07:34.988 --> 07:36.555
is Elizabeth Pryce.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.460
She was found dead
in the bedroom

07:41.462 --> 07:44.062
<i>of her house that you can see
just behind me down there.</i>

07:55.141 --> 07:57.943
Worst part is, I bumped
into them later that day.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.411
I'm tired.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.583
Hi. Excuse me, I'm
a journalist from <i> Newsweek.</i>

08:04.585 --> 08:06.184
You were Elizabeth's roommate,
right?

08:06.186 --> 08:07.586
That's right.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.155
- Oh, it must be terrible.
- It's really shocking.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.858
I'm too scared to go back
in the house.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.292
I think I put in my notes, uh,

08:14.294 --> 08:16.394
"She's a dud.
He looks boring."

08:16.396 --> 08:18.363
I could've had a scoop.

08:18.365 --> 08:22.200
A world exclusive,
instead I left Siena to go
test drive the Maserati.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.202
- The one that got away.
- Exactly.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.837
I was still in Modena
when I heard that

08:25.839 --> 08:28.640
an American woman,
an Italian man and
a Congolese man

08:28.642 --> 08:31.576
<i>So, I turned around,
went straight back.</i>

08:32.311 --> 08:33.745
Hi, can I talk to you?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.480
Have you spoken
to your daughter?

08:35.482 --> 08:39.551
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>none of us knew</i>
<i>the names of the arrested.</i>

08:39.553 --> 08:40.652
Hey there.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.187
Okay,
listen up, everybody.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.223
In the, uh, Elizabeth Pryce
memorial sweepstake,

08:45.225 --> 08:46.625
the runners and riders are

08:46.627 --> 08:49.561
Jessica Fuller, Carlo Elias,

08:49.563 --> 08:51.963
- and, uh, Cedric Bapupa.
How do you know
this stuff?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.198
Sometimes you got to
leave the cafe, mate.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.266
- Even in the rain.
- Okay. Got it.

08:54.268 --> 08:57.235
Jessica Fuller, 21,
from Baltimore.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.539
Carlo Elias, 25.
Likes knives.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.941
- It's like a public confession.
- Yeah, or a suicide note.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.142
Who's Cedric Bapupa?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.545
He runs the bar where
Jessica works. Bar Rumba.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.179
I get scuppered
even in my own town.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.548
Yes, you do.
You get scuppered.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.083
Well, I see your meat-cleaver,
I raise you a gun.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.752
And a YouTube link.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.186
She's pretty.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.922
<i>You put this on YouTube,
you motherfucker,</i>

09:16.924 --> 09:19.124
<i>I'm going to kill you, okay?</i>

09:19.126 --> 09:20.358
<i>Now, they were unlucky.</i>

09:20.360 --> 09:22.060
The families tried to
erase the Internet info,

09:22.062 --> 09:23.361
but it was too late.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.897
All their dirty laundry
was hung out to dry.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.946
Thomas just wanted to meet,
and um,

09:40.948 --> 09:42.708
get your take on what happened.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.817
Of course.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.919
I'm asked many times.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.322
- When did you hear
about the killing?
- A phone call.

09:50.324 --> 09:51.990
<i>There wasn't much information.</i>

09:51.992 --> 09:53.391
<i>Just the address of the house.</i>

09:57.663 --> 10:00.165
<i>The burglary was false.</i>

10:00.167 --> 10:03.234
<i>Glass on top
of the disturbed clothing,</i>

10:03.236 --> 10:04.502
<i>wrong way around.</i>

10:05.471 --> 10:08.206
Most importantly, the body.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.075
<i>It was covered by a duvet.</i>

10:11.043 --> 10:13.278
At that moment,
I could feel it.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.080
Only a woman

10:15.082 --> 10:17.782
would cover a body
when it is already dead.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.651
The following day,
I asked Jessica

10:19.653 --> 10:21.620
to show me around the apartment.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.822
She was very calm.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.056
Very collected.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.591
When we came to the kitchen,

10:26.593 --> 10:28.460
I asked her
to look in the drawer

10:28.462 --> 10:31.363
and tell me if there were
any knives missing.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.833
She became hysterical.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.801
That is when we started to tap

10:36.803 --> 10:38.603
the phones of Jessica and Carlo.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.244
<i>We knew Carlo was lying.</i>

10:46.246 --> 10:49.948
He switched off his
phone at 8:45 that night.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.683
So had Jessica.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.986
They turned their phones on at
6:00 the next morning.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.921
He had no phone call
from his father.

11:04.797 --> 11:06.564
We checked his computer.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.466
He hadn't even surfed the net.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.236
They hadn't thought
through their alibis.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.615
Carlo and I went
back to his apartment.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.350
We watched a DVD together.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.819
<i>Amelie.</i>

11:27.821 --> 11:29.387
And then we had dinner.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.356
Together?
- Yes.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.559
Then we made love.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.499
You got a message on
your phone from Cedric Bapupa.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.135
You replied...

11:44.137 --> 11:46.004
- Did you see him?
- No.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.239
Why did you say
<i>"Ci vediamo pui tardi"?</i>

11:48.241 --> 11:49.874
I was just being friendly.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.377
If they were guilty,

11:52.379 --> 11:54.379
wouldn't they have worked out
what to say?

11:54.381 --> 11:57.515
People do not behave
rationally in cases like this.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.384
So she panicked
and accused Bapupa?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.319
Exactly.

12:01.321 --> 12:05.156
I met Cedric and took him back
to our house

12:05.158 --> 12:07.325
because he liked Elizabeth

12:07.327 --> 12:09.894
and wanted to start
something with her.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.397
Cedric and her
were in Lizzie's bedroom

12:12.399 --> 12:14.666
while I must've stayed
in the kitchen.

12:14.668 --> 12:17.502
At a certain point,
I heard Lizzie screaming.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.339
I was frightened of him.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.975
I got scared and put my hands
over my ears.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.879
I can't remember anything else.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.796
And why would she accuse
someone who's innocent?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.064
Who knows?

12:46.066 --> 12:49.267
Maybe she knew a black guy
had been involved somehow,

12:49.269 --> 12:50.769
thought, uh,

12:50.771 --> 12:52.771
accusing a different black man

12:53.606 --> 12:54.939
might confuse us.

13:51.263 --> 13:53.398
- Hey, darling.
- Joey.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.001
Joe, this is, um, Thomas.

13:57.003 --> 14:01.172
- Currently head of...
- Uh, this week the <i> Daily Mail</i> and Sky.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.807
- Oh, so, are you the film guy?
- Right.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.909
Who's gonna play me?
I bet everyone asks you that.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.644
- No, you're the first.
- Oh, great. Well, hey...

14:06.646 --> 14:09.047
- I'm thinking Colin Farrell.
- He's Irish.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.516
- Yeah. He's also really
good-looking, sensitive.
- This is perfect.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.585
Change the accent
and keep the face.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.153
- I'll bear him in mind.
- Sure.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.156
Listen. I love your wife's
TV show, by the way.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.358
She's not my wife.
She's my ex-partner.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.660
Yeah. It must have been very
difficult when you separated.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.229
Especially because
she moved in with her

14:24.231 --> 14:25.396
onscreen husband.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.098
Now, would you be interested
in talking about that?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.200
We could put across
your point of view, you know.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.635
The difficulty of having
your private life

14:30.637 --> 14:32.737
- picked over by
the gossip industry
- No. I wouldn't.

14:33.305 --> 14:34.405
It's worth a try.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.474
- Uh, are going to eat later?
- Sure.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.042
- Usual place? Uh-huh
- Yes.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.011
Sorry.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.546
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.787
Hey. Hi, Bea.
<i>Hey!</i>

14:50.656 --> 14:52.490
- How are you?
<i>- Good.</i>

14:53.092 --> 14:54.158
<i>Where are you?</i>

14:54.593 --> 14:55.660
In Italy.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.129
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

14:58.597 --> 14:59.931
Uh, London home?

15:00.633 --> 15:03.134
<i>No. Your home. Here home.</i>

15:03.136 --> 15:05.403
Um, soon.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.572
- In a few weeks.
<i>- Okay.</i>

15:08.040 --> 15:09.340
I Miss you!

15:10.042 --> 15:12.911
Missing you, too.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.546
What you're up to?
<i>Bea, come on,</i>
<i>we're going to be late.</i>

15:15.548 --> 15:17.215
<i>Okay, coming!</i>

15:17.217 --> 15:18.683
<i>Well, I got to go, Daddy.</i>

15:18.685 --> 15:20.485
Okay.
I call you tomorrow, okay?

15:21.754 --> 15:22.887
Bea?

15:23.289 --> 15:24.355
Bea?

15:29.028 --> 15:30.895
- Hey.
- Hi, Sarah.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.664
- How are you?
- Good.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.265
- This is Sarah.
- Red or white?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.000
She's a producer
for the US networks.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.336
She has a special fondness
for Siena.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.639
Not. I spent so much
time here, my marriage
went down the pan.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.409
Just another casualty
of war reporting.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.811
- It's not really a war though.
- No, it kind of feels
like it though.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.513
There's all this competitive
flag-waving.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.114
It's like they're innocent
or they're guilty,

15:50.116 --> 15:51.349
and you can't be neutral.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.417
What do you think?

15:52.419 --> 15:53.685
I work for the networks.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.520
We pay for Jessica's
family to be here.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.122
So, they have spent
an absolute fortune

15:58.124 --> 16:00.224
on the flights, hotels,
lawyers,

16:00.226 --> 16:02.393
and we get exclusive
interviews in return.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.729
So she's innocent?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.998
Of course she is innocent.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.700
No, look, they have the guy
banged up.

16:08.702 --> 16:09.867
- Joseph, okay?
- Wrong guy.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.869
He had a criminal record.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.271
He had threatened
somebody with a knife.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.373
Right. So why did they
accuse Cedric Bapupa?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.641
Uh, why did they
switch the phone off?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.242
Why did she say she was
there and heard screams?

16:18.244 --> 16:19.544
And why sign a confession?

16:19.546 --> 16:21.412
And, uh, the blond hair
that they found on the body.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.480
Which they lost.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.915
When the police showed up
at the house,

16:23.917 --> 16:25.583
she and Carlo had
a mop and bucket.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.319
They'd been out at 7:00
in the morning buying bleach.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.487
What were they cleaning up?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.609
Why was she doing yoga
in the police waiting room?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.894
Listen. The police
and the prosecutors,

16:36.896 --> 16:39.964
they condemned the wrong
people in the wrong order.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.933
- And the press all
piled in after.
- That's what we do.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.102
At the end of the day,
she said she was there,

16:44.104 --> 16:46.637
in the house, on the night.
Guilty!

16:46.639 --> 16:48.373
- Game Over.
- Exactly.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.775
Why would they do it?
What's the motive?

16:50.777 --> 16:53.244
- You need a reason.
- Right. It's not a film.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.680
Okay? It's not
a Miss Marple mystery.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.216
Why does no one ever want to
make a story about Carlo?

16:59.819 --> 17:01.686
No. No.
Carlo is the quiet one.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.588
What will happen tomorrow
with the appeal?

17:03.590 --> 17:06.590
Yeah, we'll get our pictures,
and then we'll go.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.126
This is just
a really good excuse

17:08.127 --> 17:09.761
to catch up on all the gossip.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.430
How's your husband?

17:12.432 --> 17:14.464
- The last I heard...
- Is he still chasing
small boys in Morocco, or...

17:14.467 --> 17:16.334
Fucking your wife, actually.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.703
Someone has to.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.648
Good evening.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.308
- Well.
- Well.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.524
I guess it's goodnight.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.691
Guess so.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.366
You okay?
You need a pass.

18:23.569 --> 18:24.635
Thank you.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.118
Wow, she changed her style.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.586
They're not going to
make the same mistake twice,

18:41.588 --> 18:42.687
are they?

18:44.022 --> 18:45.623
How're you feeling today,
Jessica?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.392
I'm going to call that demure.

18:58.837 --> 19:01.105
Simone, how did Jessica
strike you today?

19:01.107 --> 19:03.441
Her hair was darker
than it was the last
time we saw her.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.043
She was wearing a very
demure skirt.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.813
She seemed older,
more composed.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.581
Her Italian had
improved a lot.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.283
And what can we expect
next from the case?

19:12.285 --> 19:13.651
The case has been adjourned,

19:13.653 --> 19:16.654
but the appellate process
could take many months.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.131
Hey.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.566
Coffee.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.035
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.470
So, does it all make sense?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.305
Not yet. Too many angles.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.275
Jessica is innocent.
That is your story.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.609
Uh, this is Francesco.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.944
He's Joseph's lawyer.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.146
This is Thomas. He's making
a film about Jessica.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.714
Not about Jessica,
about the case.

19:43.716 --> 19:47.351
Hmm. You should make Joseph
your protagonist.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.220
His is the best story of all,

19:49.222 --> 19:51.022
and it tells you a lot
about Italy.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.223
Well, about the world.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.858
Go on.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.027
The police knew there was
someone else in the flat.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.763
Someone had a shit in
the toilet, and left it there.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.765
So they arrested Cedric Bapupa.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.302
Then he got lucky.
He got a cast-iron alibi.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.171
So the police start checking
their database.

20:07.173 --> 20:10.274
They found that the shit
belonged to Joseph Derma.

20:10.276 --> 20:13.978
A young guy who had been
adopted by a family in Siena.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.179
He was definitely involved?

20:15.181 --> 20:16.380
He was definitely
in the apartment,

20:16.382 --> 20:18.182
uh, we don't dispute that.

20:18.850 --> 20:19.917
A couple of days later,

20:19.919 --> 20:21.953
Joseph went to Munich.
He left Siena.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.422
The police got a friend
to contact him on Skype.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.008
So you see?
Jessica had nothing
to do with it.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.676
It was perfect for the police.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.678
They just swapped one
black man for another.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.714
Oh, come on,
you know he's guilty.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.148
There's no point playing
the race card.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.117
Joseph went
for a separate trial.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.185
I believe what he said.

20:54.187 --> 20:57.121
And he was the only one
who seemed genuinely sad

20:57.123 --> 20:58.256
by Elizabeth's death.

23:35.614 --> 23:38.048
Thomas, lovely, lovely,
lovely to meet you finally.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.084
- Hey. Adam. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.319
- Hi. How are you doing?
- Hi.

23:42.321 --> 23:45.189
So, we are all
very excited about this.

23:45.191 --> 23:48.292
We're absolutely thrilled
that you're on board.

23:48.294 --> 23:50.227
Well done, Steve, for dragging
him back from Hollywood.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.529
- Pleasure.
- This will be the first time

23:51.531 --> 23:53.264
that you guys have
worked together...

23:53.266 --> 23:55.466
Uh, since, uh, the last time.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.002
So, um,
what happened with your

23:58.004 --> 24:00.237
CIA in Central America project?

24:00.239 --> 24:01.639
First I got the stars
and no money,

24:01.641 --> 24:03.174
and then I got the money,
but lost the stars.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.376
Ah, such a shame.
I loved that script.

24:06.344 --> 24:08.612
Thomas, tell us, how was...
How was Italy?

24:08.614 --> 24:11.182
- Interesting.
- This is a great, great story.

24:11.184 --> 24:14.218
- It's gonna be wonderful.
- Siena is beautiful.
It's an amazing city.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.454
Should almost be
a character in the film.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.688
We have a clash of cultures,

24:17.690 --> 24:19.356
American, Italian, British...

24:19.358 --> 24:22.126
And two great parts
for young women.
Do you have any thoughts?

24:22.128 --> 24:24.495
Fortunately,
we are now blessed
with a whole

24:24.497 --> 24:26.363
ream of fantastic
young actresses.

24:26.365 --> 24:27.465
Carey Mulligan would be good.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.667
Yeah. She's very beautiful
in her acting...

24:29.669 --> 24:31.368
Well. I think I have to
work out the story

24:31.370 --> 24:32.736
before we start casting.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.772
- Yeah.
- Yep.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.508
Have you worked out what
your angle is going to be?

24:37.510 --> 24:41.545
I was thinking maybe
Simone herself. A journalist.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.427
Might be the right way
into the story.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.182
What's she like?

24:45.184 --> 24:47.952
Interesting. Intelligent.
Attractive.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.154
- How old is she?
- Mid-30s.

24:50.156 --> 24:53.424
I think that a whole world
of foreign correspondence
could be rich for us.

24:53.426 --> 24:54.492
Sort of an exile.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.194
- Naomi Watts?
- Chloe Sevigny maybe?

24:57.196 --> 24:58.462
Or Tina Fey?

24:58.464 --> 25:00.431
I love Tina Fey. She's...

25:00.433 --> 25:03.534
They just need a sense
of how you see the story.

25:04.469 --> 25:06.370
Sure. Okay.

25:06.372 --> 25:09.406
You going to work
on the script here or in LA?

25:09.408 --> 25:10.608
- Here in Italy.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.477
Not in LA. Can't concentrate.

25:13.479 --> 25:16.580
Everybody knows Katherine,
or knows someone
who knows Katherine

25:16.582 --> 25:18.616
from some fucking party
or other.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.519
And there's
all that shit with Timothy,
custody issues and...

25:23.389 --> 25:25.055
I hate this fucking prick.

25:26.157 --> 25:28.225
Did you really threaten
to kill him?

25:28.227 --> 25:31.495
It makes me sick to think
of Bea growing up with
him in that house.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.597
Another drink?

25:35.066 --> 25:36.834
- Can I get two more, please?
- Same again?

25:36.836 --> 25:38.196
Yeah, that'd be great,
thanks, man.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.603
Of course.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.708
I was thinking of flying back
to Italy for Halloween.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.443
Shoot some documentary stuff.

25:46.445 --> 25:47.678
Won't cost that much.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.381
Yeah, it's a good idea.
Go for it.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.657
Is it in focus?

25:59.659 --> 26:01.058
No, it's not in focus.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.497
Pan with her.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.273
Okay if we film you?

26:17.108 --> 26:19.310
Uh, yeah, sure.

26:19.312 --> 26:21.278
We should go back to
Piazza del Campo now.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.546
It'll be busier there.

26:22.548 --> 26:24.582
Well, you know what we need.
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

26:24.584 --> 26:25.649
- Okay.
- Yep.

26:25.651 --> 26:26.717
I got it. Here.

26:37.929 --> 26:38.996
Happy Halloween!

26:38.998 --> 26:41.031
- Can I get a drink?
- Yeah, of course.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.601
It's what I'm here for.

26:43.603 --> 26:46.070
We have a special
on zombies tonight.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.371
- Try one.
- Good, good.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.505
Where you from?

26:48.507 --> 26:49.807
Uh, I'm from London, actually.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.108
- Oh, really?
- Wandsworth.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.876
- Oh, wow. Know it.
- Really?

26:52.878 --> 26:55.613
- Yeah, I lived in London
for six years.
- Oh, no way!

26:55.615 --> 26:57.314
So, what are you filming?

26:57.316 --> 26:59.083
Did you hear about
the Jessica Fuller case?

26:59.085 --> 27:00.618
Yeah, 'course.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.952
Is it another documentary?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.387
- Film.
- Are you the director?

27:03.389 --> 27:05.189
- Yes, I am.
- No way.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.791
- Do you live in Siena?
- Uh, I've been here
about six months.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.326
It's lovely.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.295
Do you need any actresses,
by any chance?

27:11.297 --> 27:14.131
Um, no. Not yet. But a guide.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.899
I want to see the real Siena.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.801
Do you work here every night?

27:17.803 --> 27:20.237
Most nights, not always.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.640
I can give you my number,
if that helps?

27:23.208 --> 27:24.508
Yeah. Sure.

27:24.510 --> 27:25.576
Cool.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.183
Call me if you need me.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.786
Sure. What's your name?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.755
- Uh, I'm Melanie.
- Thomas.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.390
Nice to meet you, Thomas.

27:44.763 --> 27:46.363
- How are you?
- Good.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.165
Hey. How'd it go?

27:48.167 --> 27:50.868
Wasn't quite the Sodom
and Gomorrah your book
made it out to be.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.202
Oh, it's still early.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.304
You got to give the town
a chance.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.506
Did you get to the red zone?

27:55.508 --> 27:57.107
Uh-huh. The crew were only
booked until midnight.

27:57.109 --> 27:59.710
That doesn't go on
until 1:00 a.m.. So...

27:59.712 --> 28:01.612
Let's go anyway.

28:01.614 --> 28:03.374
I want to see Siena
at its worst.

28:10.955 --> 28:12.056
It's left here.

28:19.664 --> 28:20.898
Simone.

28:26.504 --> 28:27.871
What's the matter?

28:27.873 --> 28:30.941
Are you scared to see me
after what you wrote?

28:30.943 --> 28:32.242
- This is Thomas.
- Hello.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.510
I know who he is.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.412
You want to be careful
with this one.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.581
She seems so nice
when you meet her.

28:37.583 --> 28:41.118
Then, when she writes,
she turns into a real bitch.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.721
- Come and have a drink.
- We're on our way
to the red zone.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.355
Come on,
that's for shitty students.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.091
You're not students, are you?

28:47.093 --> 28:48.492
Not for a long time.

28:50.128 --> 28:53.230
In a murder, the dead body
tells you a lot.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.933
I saw Elizabeth's body,
in the morgue.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.568
How?

28:57.570 --> 28:58.836
I visit the morgue often.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.205
I have a cousin.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.440
It's important to look
death in the face

29:03.442 --> 29:05.709
if you want to understand life.

29:05.711 --> 29:08.479
That's why there are
so many murder stories.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.414
Every news program is
full of killings,

29:10.416 --> 29:12.015
so many films.

29:12.017 --> 29:14.151
Death is the end of
everyone's story.

29:15.453 --> 29:17.121
The only thing we share,

29:17.123 --> 29:19.003
now we no longer
believe in God.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.862
And so we have become
obsessed with killings.

29:25.997 --> 29:29.066
Real killings,
fictional killings...

29:29.068 --> 29:31.135
But from the safety
of our homes,

29:32.036 --> 29:33.270
where the only issue is,

29:34.172 --> 29:35.439
"Who done it?"

29:36.341 --> 29:38.408
Not what it means.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.511
When we see it on TV
and not in the flesh.

29:40.513 --> 29:42.780
In the flesh,
when a friend dies,

29:42.782 --> 29:44.915
we don't even want
to see the body.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.351
So what did the body tell you?

29:48.153 --> 29:49.953
That Jessica didn't do it.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.555
So why is she on trial?

29:52.457 --> 29:54.358
Police here are the worst.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.993
Corrupt, incompetent.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.715
Everyone is corrupt here, but...

29:58.429 --> 29:59.863
She didn't kill her.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.232
I know her. We have talked.

30:03.067 --> 30:04.401
She is intelligent.

30:05.904 --> 30:07.871
Not like most of
the students here.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.973
The students I teach are idiots.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.342
Not Jessica.
She has true understanding.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.212
So you think it was
one of the others?

30:15.214 --> 30:18.282
Carlo had a collection
of knives, okay?

30:18.284 --> 30:20.324
Elizabeth was killed
with more than one knife.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.153
But the police never found them.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.555
Because they are fools.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.191
I know where they are.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.560
So why don't you just give
them to the police, Edoardo?

30:30.795 --> 30:32.963
They will try to frame me.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.165
And they have already
arrested me before.

30:36.301 --> 30:38.168
They broke my finger.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.204
I would be an easy target,
like Cedric.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.172
- A scapegoat.
- Come on.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.708
No one likes me because
I write the truth.

30:44.710 --> 30:47.678
I tell the world
how stupid they are.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.560
Have you already
talked to Cedric?

30:51.082 --> 30:52.616
- No.
- Why?

30:53.585 --> 30:54.751
Are you hiding people from him,

30:54.753 --> 30:57.221
or don't you know
as much as you pretend?

30:57.223 --> 30:59.423
Cedric Bapupa is
a friend of mine.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.191
If you want to meet him,
I can set it up.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.993
Yeah, for a price.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.928
Always a price for everything.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.030
Do you think
you are the only one
allowed to make

31:07.032 --> 31:08.398
money from this story?

31:08.933 --> 31:10.000
Hmm?

31:10.002 --> 31:12.369
You're not a guy whose
life was ruined by it.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.606
Quite a character.

31:15.608 --> 31:17.074
Hmm, yeah.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.676
His blog had stuff on it
that nobody else knew.

31:19.678 --> 31:22.045
We all had to read it
every day to keep up to speed.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.615
He has the time
and he knows everybody,

31:24.617 --> 31:26.049
and he also has money.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.818
He rents out rooms
all over the city.

31:27.820 --> 31:29.152
Really cheap.

31:29.154 --> 31:30.487
Almost squats.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.223
And they say he deals
drugs on the side.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.158
- Handy man to know.
- -Yeah.

31:36.327 --> 31:38.762
Sometimes I think he might
actually be the killer.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.831
When we were
covering the trials,
somebody decided

31:40.833 --> 31:42.933
that Joe and I were
having an affair,

31:42.935 --> 31:45.969
and they put it
on the Internet.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.971
It was just an easy way
of attacking somebody who

31:47.973 --> 31:49.439
wasn't on Jessica's side,

31:50.275 --> 31:51.708
but I think it was Edoardo.

31:53.478 --> 31:57.814
It wasn't true,
but I had to tell my husband.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.549
Mmm.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.185
We're separated now.

32:20.805 --> 32:24.074
<i>"The man</i>
<i>who lies asleep</i>
<i>will never waken fame,</i>

32:24.076 --> 32:26.743
<i>"and his desire and
all his life drift past him</i>

32:26.745 --> 32:30.681
<i>"like a dream, and the traces
of his memory fade from time</i>

32:30.683 --> 32:33.684
<i>"like smoke in air
or ripples on a stream."</i>

32:37.422 --> 32:38.522
Hi.

32:38.524 --> 32:39.690
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:39.692 --> 32:41.224
This seat taken?

32:44.729 --> 32:47.664
- Pretty view.
- Yeah.

32:49.233 --> 32:54.271
What's this?
Oh, bit of light reading.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.107
Calls itself a comedy,
but not that many laughs.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.675
Are you in heaven or hell?

32:58.677 --> 32:59.910
Inferno.

33:02.013 --> 33:03.613
I have to go back to Rome.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.315
I have the kids this weekend.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.717
Lucky you.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.289
Okay, have a good one.

33:19.964 --> 33:21.565
- Bye.
- Bye.

34:20.525 --> 34:21.757
Hey. It's me, Thomas.

34:21.760 --> 34:22.926
<i>Hey, Thomas!</i>

34:22.928 --> 34:24.261
I'm in your bar,
but you're not here.

34:24.263 --> 34:27.097
<i>I'm at a party.
Not much of a party, but...</i>

34:27.099 --> 34:28.231
<i>Do you wanna come?</i>

34:28.233 --> 34:29.966
I thought it wasn't any good.

34:29.967 --> 34:33.003
<i>It's your typical
student party, so...</i>

34:33.005 --> 34:34.804
- Then I have to come.
<i>- Okay, great!</i>

34:34.806 --> 34:36.039
For research.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.107
<i>Good.</i>

34:41.012 --> 34:42.579
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:48.485 --> 34:50.120
Mr. Director.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.989
- You can call me Thomas.
- 'Course.

34:53.992 --> 34:55.672
So, this is
your comeback film.

34:57.027 --> 34:59.796
Hope so. How do you know?

34:59.798 --> 35:01.398
I looked you up on
<i>Siena's Burning.</i>

35:01.400 --> 35:03.533
- Do you know the blog?
- Yeah.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.902
Don't believe
everything you read.

35:05.904 --> 35:08.038
'Course.
Only the good things.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.108
Here it is. Come on.

35:27.425 --> 35:29.392
- This is Thomas.
- Hi.

35:32.763 --> 35:34.464
Thomas, everyone.
Everyone, Thomas.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.699
Hey.

35:39.904 --> 35:41.471
- Do you have a lighter?
- Yeah.

36:36.561 --> 36:37.661
Hey.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.964
What are you doing here?

36:42.266 --> 36:45.135
- Come with me.
- I'm tired.

36:45.137 --> 36:47.170
Come.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.906
How can you make a movie
about the murder if you

36:49.908 --> 36:53.109
haven't even seen where
the killing happened?

36:53.111 --> 36:55.845
- Listen, it's late.
- No time like the present.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.647
Strike while the iron's hot.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.016
Don't you know your
English sayings?

37:20.638 --> 37:22.505
This is the window they entered.

37:25.843 --> 37:28.144
Don't throw stones if
you live in glass houses.

37:41.859 --> 37:44.261
Come on, it's empty!

37:44.263 --> 37:47.931
If you were here that night,
you could have saved her.

37:49.233 --> 37:51.101
That's what everyone dreams.

37:54.839 --> 37:56.539
This is Elizabeth's room.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.410
She was found by the wardrobe.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.180
Look what they didn't find.

38:13.157 --> 38:16.192
This is the knife
that killed her.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.828
But the police never even
looked under the wardrobe.

38:20.231 --> 38:24.868
They didn't even look
under the fucking wardrobe.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.959
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.062
I'm sorry.

38:52.064 --> 38:53.697
That's my after work one.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.598
I always go better
with the dob.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.367
- Let me take you home.
- It's all right.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.329
Come on, it's like
a maze out there.

39:01.672 --> 39:02.939
What are you studying here?

39:02.941 --> 39:05.342
Italian literature,
culture and cinema.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.544
- Oh.
- It's very serious.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.879
It's a whole four hours
every morning.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.315
I mean, it's...
It's an excuse, to be honest.

39:12.317 --> 39:15.418
An excuse to be here
and have fun for a year.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.120
It's a pretty good one.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.422
- Aren't you having fun?
- Yeah.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.925
- I always have fun.
- Even at work?

39:23.094 --> 39:24.227
Yeah.

39:24.229 --> 39:27.230
I mean, come on,
I do make a mean mojito.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.532
Do you?

39:29.534 --> 39:32.402
Put a bit too much rum in,
and watch everyone get drunk.

39:33.337 --> 39:34.904
It's good for tips, too.

39:38.075 --> 39:39.776
Here we are.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.845
Delivered back to your
hotel safe and sound,

39:41.847 --> 39:43.146
as I promised.

39:43.615 --> 39:47.317
- All right, <i> auf Wiedersehen.</i>
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

40:03.768 --> 40:06.569
<i>You may follow me,
and I will guide you,</i>

40:06.571 --> 40:08.738
<i>and lead you from here.</i>

40:08.740 --> 40:10.907
<i>But if you want to see
the blessed,</i>

40:10.909 --> 40:13.243
<i>then a spirit worthier
than I must lead you.</i>

40:26.390 --> 40:29.826
"Abandon hope,
all ye who enter here."

40:38.502 --> 40:39.769
How's Bea?

40:39.771 --> 40:41.104
She's good.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.540
And Katherine, I saw she
was nominated for an Emmy.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.308
Very impressive.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.911
Must be hard, seeing her
face everywhere...

40:47.913 --> 40:49.753
Can we talk about
something else?

40:51.450 --> 40:52.916
You guys were so
good together...

40:52.918 --> 40:54.751
Please, come on.

41:00.991 --> 41:03.426
How come we're not talking
about <i> The Face of an Angel?</i>

41:03.428 --> 41:06.729
How's it going?

41:06.731 --> 41:09.132
Everyone is asking
me about the script.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.433
Have you worked
out who did it?

41:10.435 --> 41:12.001
- It's not a whodunit.
- Just teasing.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.970
Carlo and Jessica
and Joseph did it.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.305
That's why they're in prison.

41:15.307 --> 41:16.606
For now.

41:16.608 --> 41:17.941
There's so many angles.

41:17.943 --> 41:20.310
How to organize it in
a meaningful way...

41:20.312 --> 41:22.712
It's important that it's
a story based on truth.

41:22.714 --> 41:23.847
Mmm-hmm.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.982
But I wanna do something
that transcends them,

41:25.984 --> 41:28.451
which is not just a
simple reconstruction.

41:28.453 --> 41:30.620
Thank you.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.922
Carry on.

41:32.924 --> 41:36.025
I was trying to see if it's
possible to use the shape of

41:37.228 --> 41:39.529
Dante's Divine Comedy
as the shape of the film.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.799
After all,
it's a three-act structure.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.734
Hell, purgatory, heaven.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.069
Happy ending.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.303
It's perfect, really.

41:48.272 --> 41:49.806
Are you being serious?

41:49.808 --> 41:52.108
Dante was in love with
a beautiful Beatrice,

41:52.110 --> 41:53.510
and then she died.

41:53.512 --> 41:56.045
Heartbroken,
he goes in search of her,

41:56.047 --> 41:59.382
but he also goes in search of
a meaning to life and death.

41:59.384 --> 42:01.017
Listen, Caroline's
commissioned you to make

42:01.019 --> 42:03.019
a true crime thriller.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.654
Are you really saying
you're trying to write

42:04.656 --> 42:06.155
a medieval morality tale?

42:06.157 --> 42:07.423
No, no, no.
It would be modern.

42:07.425 --> 42:08.658
And it would deal
with the case.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.260
It would just follow
the shape of the poem,

42:10.262 --> 42:12.595
because the story,
the real story, is too hard.

42:12.597 --> 42:14.097
It's too brutal.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.533
The poem is really a dream,
a nightmare.

42:16.535 --> 42:19.802
Dante is a man in the middle
of his life who lost his way.

42:19.804 --> 42:21.638
Strayed off the narrow path,
and finds himself

42:21.640 --> 42:24.274
back in a deep, black forest.

42:24.276 --> 42:26.109
You know, lots of the stuff
in the poem's

42:26.111 --> 42:28.311
actually classic
horror movie stuff.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.848
The return of the repressed.

42:34.318 --> 42:36.719
They want to make a film
about two teenagers

42:36.721 --> 42:38.855
- and a murder
that can't be solved.
- I know.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.356
And now you want to
give them a script about

42:40.358 --> 42:42.759
a middle-aged man
who's lost his way.

42:44.328 --> 42:45.488
How much have you written?

42:46.497 --> 42:47.564
Not much.

42:47.566 --> 42:50.934
Good, then you haven't
wasted too much time.

42:50.936 --> 42:55.204
Thomas, you're
too young to have
a mid-life crisis.

42:55.206 --> 42:57.307
It's been four years.

42:57.309 --> 42:58.641
They really want this film.

42:58.643 --> 43:00.743
Give them
something they can make.

43:02.646 --> 43:03.913
Please.

43:04.315 --> 43:05.481
Yeah.

43:30.674 --> 43:33.209
<i>Exterior, Tuscan countryside.</i>

43:33.644 --> 43:34.777
<i>Day.</i>

43:35.512 --> 43:37.714
<i>Jessica is sitting on a train.</i>

43:37.716 --> 43:40.750
<i>She's outgoing,
confident, attractive.</i>

43:40.752 --> 43:43.052
<i>Elizabeth makes
the same journey.</i>

43:43.921 --> 43:45.655
<i>Jessica arrives first.</i>

43:45.657 --> 43:48.024
<i>Elizabeth, a few days later.</i>

43:48.026 --> 43:50.793
<i>She's quieter,
calm, thoughtful.</i>

43:55.966 --> 43:58.201
<i>They both find a room
in a house on the edge</i>

43:58.203 --> 44:00.103
<i>of the medieval town.</i>

44:00.105 --> 44:02.138
<i>They're both full of hope
and excitement</i>

44:02.140 --> 44:03.573
<i>for the year ahead.</i>

44:14.918 --> 44:16.386
How's the script going?

44:17.988 --> 44:19.288
Not.

44:21.191 --> 44:23.126
Missing your daughter?

44:28.866 --> 44:31.634
Well, I'm seeing her now,
but I'll be back
in a moment, sir.

44:31.636 --> 44:33.469
Okay. Okay, Bobby.

44:33.471 --> 44:34.737
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

44:34.739 --> 44:35.838
- Hey.
- Hi.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.040
I thought you might like this.

44:37.042 --> 44:38.508
It's one of my articles.

44:38.510 --> 44:39.809
Thank you.

44:41.378 --> 44:43.312
Strange, when I think of
<i>A Face of an Angel,</i>

44:43.314 --> 44:44.814
I always think of Elizabeth.

44:44.816 --> 44:45.948
But you all mean Jessica.

44:45.950 --> 44:47.483
Yeah, we all use
that line for Jessica.

44:47.485 --> 44:48.685
Jessica is like a film star,

44:48.687 --> 44:49.852
blank canvas.

44:49.854 --> 44:52.422
Somewhere we project
our fantasies onto.

44:52.424 --> 44:53.723
She's the story.

44:53.725 --> 44:55.324
Yeah, guilty or not,
that's all anyone
wants to read.

44:55.326 --> 44:57.360
It's sad that Elizabeth
just disappeared.

44:57.362 --> 44:59.429
Oh, look at that, he's got
Jessica's diaries there.

44:59.431 --> 45:01.297
There's some flawless
journalism right there.

45:01.299 --> 45:02.865
Joe's very proud of his scoop.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.600
You know the police
played a dirty trick on

45:04.602 --> 45:05.835
her when she was in jail?

45:05.837 --> 45:09.072
They told her that she had
tested positive for HIV,

45:09.074 --> 45:11.741
so she had to write
a list of everyone

45:11.743 --> 45:12.809
she had ever slept with.

45:12.811 --> 45:13.876
It's in there.

45:13.878 --> 45:15.311
How much did you pay for it?

45:15.313 --> 45:17.246
These diaries, they're not
even that big a deal.

45:17.248 --> 45:19.348
Okay, it's one
of the things that I used

45:19.350 --> 45:20.983
to articulate a story about her.

45:20.985 --> 45:23.286
So, for example,
she says that she wants to

45:23.288 --> 45:24.654
- visit a sex shop.
- Oh, please.

45:24.656 --> 45:26.589
Uh, she writes a letter
to her boyfriend saying

45:26.591 --> 45:28.224
she wants to watch
a porn film and then

45:28.226 --> 45:30.293
practice with him.
She emailed her friends.

45:30.295 --> 45:32.695
She had sex with
this random guy that she

45:32.697 --> 45:34.497
- met on a train in Italy...
- So?

45:34.499 --> 45:36.165
She had a vibrator in
the bathroom she shared

45:36.167 --> 45:38.434
with Elizabeth.
It became part of the trial.

45:38.436 --> 45:40.903
- Exactly.
- It was only this big.

45:40.905 --> 45:42.672
I remember the famous
kiss outside the house.

45:42.674 --> 45:44.006
That kiss put them in prison.

45:44.008 --> 45:45.875
Oh, she went underwear
shopping the night

45:45.877 --> 45:46.943
after the murder.

45:46.945 --> 45:48.044
None of that makes
her a killer.

45:48.046 --> 45:49.178
Well, people love it.

45:49.180 --> 45:51.547
I mean, sex and murder sells.

45:51.549 --> 45:53.382
Is that everything
you're interested in?

45:53.384 --> 45:54.717
Yeah, because it's
how I make a living.

45:54.719 --> 45:55.985
And you know what,
guess what,
it's how you make

45:55.987 --> 45:57.120
a living now too.

45:57.122 --> 45:59.021
She wrote a fantasy
story about rape.

45:59.023 --> 46:00.757
I'm writing a script
about a murder.

46:00.759 --> 46:02.058
Does that make me a murderer?

46:02.060 --> 46:03.893
No, her character
was part of the trial.

46:03.895 --> 46:05.895
That's what the jury
was asked to judge.

46:05.897 --> 46:07.563
So if she would have
been a better actor,

46:07.565 --> 46:09.298
if she had behaved
well and cried,

46:09.300 --> 46:10.466
she would have been
found innocent?

46:10.468 --> 46:11.667
- Sure.
- Probably.

46:11.669 --> 46:13.569
Now she's dressing
all prim and proper,

46:13.571 --> 46:15.204
- and is likely to get off.
- 'Course.

46:15.206 --> 46:16.372
- Yeah.
- Right.

46:16.374 --> 46:17.940
So if that's all true,
don't you worry a little bit

46:17.942 --> 46:19.542
that all the stuff
you make up

46:19.544 --> 46:20.676
could make a fair
trial harder?

46:20.678 --> 46:21.978
All right, so listen, mate,
we don't actually

46:21.980 --> 46:23.246
- make stuff up, okay?
- Okay.

46:23.248 --> 46:24.680
You write what sells.
Sex sells.

46:24.682 --> 46:26.949
You steal her diaries
and make her look
like a nymphomaniac.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.050
Yeah, because
that's what she wrote.

46:28.052 --> 46:29.152
Oh, come on.

46:29.154 --> 46:31.187
You can make anyone
look bad if you want to.

46:31.189 --> 46:33.422
I daresay even you would
look like a shit

46:33.424 --> 46:34.824
if people would go through
your private life.

46:34.826 --> 46:36.526
All right, well, listen,
I'm a tabloid journalist.

46:36.528 --> 46:38.027
Everyone thinks
I'm a shit anyway.

46:38.029 --> 46:40.396
You fucking said it.

46:40.398 --> 46:42.265
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

46:42.267 --> 46:43.666
Well, he still has
my diary then.

46:43.668 --> 46:44.901
Bravo, Joe.

46:44.903 --> 46:47.770
- He didn't want my paper.
- Well, he's got taste.

47:01.518 --> 47:03.085
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

47:04.254 --> 47:07.056
<i>I want to get married
and have children.</i>

47:08.158 --> 47:10.118
<i>I want to create
something good.</i>

47:11.461 --> 47:13.229
<i>I want to get old.</i>

47:13.630 --> 47:15.598
<i>I want my time.</i>

47:15.600 --> 47:17.266
<i>I want my life.</i>

47:18.869 --> 47:21.671
<i>I don't know where
I could have got HIV from.</i>

47:32.049 --> 47:33.149
Hey.

47:33.151 --> 47:35.117
Hi, stranger,
long time, no see.

47:36.253 --> 47:40.056
- I was back in London.
- Nice. What can I get you?

47:40.058 --> 47:41.791
- Whiskey and coke.
- Cool.

47:43.727 --> 47:46.295
I was wondering,
could you do me a favor?

47:46.297 --> 47:47.463
Of course.

47:47.465 --> 47:49.799
Do you know where
I could buy some stuff?

47:49.801 --> 47:51.133
What, weed?

47:51.135 --> 47:53.302
Yeah, but...
But some other stuff too.

47:53.304 --> 47:55.838
Remember what
happened last time.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.975
- Thanks, I do.
- Is that what you want?

47:58.977 --> 48:01.611
- I'm not a dealer.
- I know.

48:01.613 --> 48:03.880
I just thought you might
be able to help a friend.

48:05.315 --> 48:06.649
That's better.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.051
Give me your phone.

48:13.690 --> 48:16.058
That's the number.
Be careful.

48:16.526 --> 48:17.593
Promise.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.132
Hi, it's me, Thomas.

48:23.134 --> 48:24.333
Are you here?

48:24.335 --> 48:25.835
<i>I'm here, where are you?</i>

48:25.837 --> 48:26.969
I'm here.

48:26.971 --> 48:28.471
Okay, I see you.

48:30.007 --> 48:32.141
So, you're a friend of Melanie?

48:32.143 --> 48:33.209
Yeah.

48:55.599 --> 48:57.767
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:57.769 --> 48:59.802
- You wanna come in?
- Sure.

48:59.804 --> 49:02.305
- Want a drink?
- Um, no, I'm good.

49:03.407 --> 49:05.875
- Uh, I have something for you.
- What is it?

49:05.877 --> 49:07.476
It's the scene of crime video.

49:07.478 --> 49:09.111
The appeal's gonna be all
about the forensics,

49:09.113 --> 49:10.713
so you really need to see
that if you wanna know

49:10.715 --> 49:12.114
what's going on.

49:12.116 --> 49:15.751
- Joe was upset about earlier.
- Good.

49:15.753 --> 49:17.353
You know, he's good
at what he does.

49:17.355 --> 49:19.722
He gets ahold of stuff
no one else does and finds

49:19.724 --> 49:20.990
a way to tell a story.

49:20.992 --> 49:24.226
He's not as bad as he
likes to pretend to be.

49:24.228 --> 49:25.895
Are you sleeping with him?

49:27.865 --> 49:31.067
- Not tonight.
- Do you still sleep with him?

49:31.069 --> 49:32.301
Are you jealous?

50:00.931 --> 50:02.465
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:03.668 --> 50:05.901
Sorry, New York wants
me to change the article.

50:05.903 --> 50:07.436
They need it in two hours.

50:07.438 --> 50:09.138
Another fashion report?

50:09.140 --> 50:10.773
Jesus, lighten up.

50:11.541 --> 50:13.309
Does it never bother you?

50:13.311 --> 50:14.477
All this shit
you have to write?

50:14.479 --> 50:16.379
I'm not writing
a fashion report.

50:16.381 --> 50:18.347
I'm writing about a murder.
Somebody was killed.

50:18.349 --> 50:19.782
You trivialize it.

50:19.784 --> 50:21.550
People want to hear
about this story.

50:21.552 --> 50:24.320
It's not up to us to
decide what people should
and shouldn't know.

50:24.322 --> 50:25.721
We just write what happened,
and then they

50:25.723 --> 50:27.656
decide whether they
want to read it or not.

50:27.658 --> 50:30.359
- That's not true.
- Well, would it be better if
we didn't cover trials at all?

50:30.361 --> 50:32.194
People had no idea
what went on in court?

50:32.196 --> 50:35.297
People had no idea
what went on during
a police investigation?

50:35.299 --> 50:36.899
That's what happens
in a police state.

50:36.901 --> 50:38.434
Then tell the truth,
don't make up the sexist...

50:38.436 --> 50:40.269
I do tell the truth,
you asshole.

50:41.405 --> 50:43.472
God, come back, Joe.

50:43.474 --> 50:46.008
At least he doesn't
lecture me after we've fucked.

50:47.344 --> 50:49.678
You know what,
you should watch this,

50:49.680 --> 50:51.614
before you get high
and mighty with everybody.

50:51.616 --> 50:53.482
That's the sad
and bitter truth.

52:45.695 --> 52:48.297
You are nurturing,
playful and easy-going.

52:48.299 --> 52:50.332
You often put others' needs
before your own,

52:50.334 --> 52:51.934
or your decisions are guided
by your feelings.

52:51.936 --> 52:54.170
- At heart, you're pragmatic
and self-possessed.
- Oh, I love it.

52:54.172 --> 52:55.838
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.306
Thomas, how's the appeal going?

52:57.308 --> 52:59.441
Yeah, quite right.

52:59.443 --> 53:01.043
No, no, no, no, no.
It's the right thing to do.

53:01.045 --> 53:03.045
I'll shut up.
Give him a minute.
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

53:03.047 --> 53:04.113
Slow.

53:04.115 --> 53:05.875
Do you think
they're gonna win?

53:06.316 --> 53:07.917
No idea.

53:07.919 --> 53:09.585
Must be difficult
not knowing the ending.

53:09.587 --> 53:12.121
I don't think it matters
for our film.

53:12.123 --> 53:14.590
I imagine that
the courts or the police
will find the truth.

53:14.592 --> 53:16.625
My idea is that it's
impossible to know.

53:16.627 --> 53:18.427
The trial is like an
episode of <i> X Factor.</i>

53:18.429 --> 53:19.895
If they like your face,
you win.

53:19.897 --> 53:21.931
- Oh, God.
- The system in
Italy's different,

53:21.933 --> 53:23.966
which makes it easier
to see it's arbitrary.

53:23.968 --> 53:26.502
But in this case the evidence
is so contradictory,

53:26.504 --> 53:28.270
we'll never know what happened.

53:28.272 --> 53:29.638
If they killed her,
it doesn't make sense.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.640
If they didn't kill her,
it doesn't make sense either.

53:31.642 --> 53:34.476
So it boils down to,
do we want to see these people

53:34.478 --> 53:36.679
going to prison for 20 years?

53:38.481 --> 53:40.082
But in the film,
we're gonna have to decide,

53:40.084 --> 53:41.350
did they do it,
how did they do it,

53:41.352 --> 53:42.918
or how else are
we gonna tell the story?

53:42.920 --> 53:45.688
I don't think
that's the story.

53:45.690 --> 53:50.059
The story is that there
is no such thing as
real truth or justice.

53:50.061 --> 53:51.560
It's just a popularity contest.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.229
Well, that's not a film.

53:53.231 --> 53:54.730
I think it can be.

53:57.300 --> 53:58.901
Well, you're gonna have
to show the two girls,

53:58.903 --> 54:00.569
who they are,
their relationship.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.404
I mean,
what happened that night,
why did it happen?

54:02.406 --> 54:04.240
All of that would be fake.

54:04.242 --> 54:06.942
It would be just my version of
what might have happened.

54:06.944 --> 54:09.612
It's more honest to say
I don't know what happened.

54:09.614 --> 54:13.882
It's like a detective story
in a world without God.

54:13.884 --> 54:15.484
Or a puzzle without a solution.

54:15.486 --> 54:18.053
Hmm. Would two people want to
do puzzles without solutions?

54:18.055 --> 54:19.421
Why not?

54:20.624 --> 54:23.459
It's more truthful than
all these easy answers.

54:25.128 --> 54:26.362
Well, it sounds
incredibly ambitious,

54:26.364 --> 54:27.630
which is what we wanted.

54:27.632 --> 54:31.033
If you want any help looking
at pages, the opening or...

54:31.035 --> 54:32.234
I'm happy to help.

54:32.236 --> 54:33.636
Thanks.

54:33.638 --> 54:34.837
Great editor.

54:34.839 --> 54:36.372
- Seriously, no, honestly.
- Thanks very much.

54:36.374 --> 54:39.541
Top, top 25 under 25.

54:39.543 --> 54:40.643
What time is it?

54:40.645 --> 54:43.746
<i>It is four-something.</i>

54:43.748 --> 54:45.281
<i>What time is it there?</i>

54:45.283 --> 54:46.915
It's late, after midnight.

54:46.917 --> 54:49.251
<i>Oh, wow, that's pretty late.</i>

54:50.654 --> 54:52.087
<i>You must be really tired, huh?</i>

54:53.223 --> 54:54.290
I can't sleep.

54:56.092 --> 54:57.526
<i>Are you okay, Daddy?</i>

54:59.229 --> 55:00.629
Listen,

55:03.300 --> 55:04.780
I gotta call you tomorrow, okay?

55:05.068 --> 55:06.869
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

55:07.237 --> 55:08.604
Bye.

55:32.195 --> 55:35.731
<i>No sadness is</i>
<i>greater than in misery to</i>
<i>rehearse memories of joy.</i>

55:47.678 --> 55:49.411
- Welcome back, Mr. Lang.
- Thank you.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.747
<i>How long are
you staying for?</i>

55:51.749 --> 55:52.815
<i>Not sure.</i>

56:06.196 --> 56:08.130
No, it's nice.
It's definitely nice.

56:10.534 --> 56:13.135
Um, I've gotta go.
See you later.

56:13.137 --> 56:14.577
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

56:15.171 --> 56:16.611
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:17.674 --> 56:19.375
Strange, seeing you
in the daylight.

56:19.377 --> 56:21.276
Why, do I look different?

56:21.278 --> 56:23.679
- Even more beautiful.
- Thank you.

56:23.681 --> 56:25.521
I like a bit of
old-fashioned courtesy.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.020
Hey, Edoardo.

56:32.288 --> 56:33.622
Hi.

56:35.759 --> 56:37.659
My friend Thomas is
looking for a place to stay.

56:37.661 --> 56:40.596
I told him I knew
someone who could help.

56:40.598 --> 56:41.830
Sit down.

56:47.804 --> 56:49.684
I'm too old for
a student accommodation.

56:50.206 --> 56:51.373
Well, I have lots of places,

56:51.375 --> 56:52.875
and the best addresses.

56:52.877 --> 56:54.176
Really?

56:54.178 --> 56:56.218
Did Simone tell you
something different?

56:56.880 --> 56:58.781
Be careful with her.

56:58.783 --> 57:01.703
If you believe everything
she says, you will
never know the truth.

57:03.586 --> 57:05.087
Do you read my blog?

57:05.855 --> 57:07.222
No.

57:07.224 --> 57:10.859
You should.
I say some very kind
things about you.

57:11.761 --> 57:14.263
- Didn't I, Melanie?
- Yeah.

57:14.265 --> 57:16.432
- Do you wanna drink?
- No, thank you.

57:20.703 --> 57:22.771
This was my uncle's house.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.239
He was a doctor.

57:32.348 --> 57:34.308
This is a perfect
place for writing.

57:34.951 --> 57:36.185
Full of atmosphere.

57:37.520 --> 57:38.787
I'll take it.

57:39.722 --> 57:40.956
How much?

57:40.958 --> 57:43.058
Money, we will talk later.

57:43.060 --> 57:45.961
First, I want you
to read my script.

57:45.963 --> 57:50.466
I have been watching
your old movies,
and I like the naivete.

57:52.268 --> 57:55.637
I'm having a small
gathering of friends tonight.

57:55.639 --> 57:57.406
I'll come to
collect you, okay?

58:27.904 --> 58:33.175
<i>"Then I saw a serpent</i>
<i>with six feet dart forth</i>
<i>in front of a man.</i>

58:33.177 --> 58:36.478
<i>"With middle feet,</i>
<i>it bound him</i>
<i>'round the paunch,</i>

58:36.480 --> 58:39.715
<i>- "and, with the forward ones,
his arms it seized.</i>

58:46.189 --> 58:48.423
<i>"Already the two heads
had one become.</i>

59:58.061 --> 59:59.161
Come on, we are late.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:02.397
You know the way is hard.

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.600
No one gets anywhere
by lying in bed.

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.868
You have to work.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.670
Work even when
you don't know why.

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:11.039
Where are we going?

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.841
Where the thieves are.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.209
Oi.

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:18.280
Thomas Lang.

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:40.702
Yeah?
<i>Hey, Thomas.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:42.337
I'm in... I'm in my flat.

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:53.382
Hi.

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:54.850
Hey.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:56.118
You good?

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.319
Yeah.

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:01.623
Where are we going?

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.065
- To see Edoardo.
- Oh.

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:09.331
I really think you should be
making a love story.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.733
All the best movies
are love stories.

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:15.570
<i>Romeo and Juliet.
Casablanca. Annie Hall.</i>

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:16.838
<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.609
- Ciao.
- Hi.

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.314
Hello, Thomas.

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:27.416
Hey.

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:29.151
What's the matter?

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.988
Why you always seem so scared?

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.990
What is it you're scared of?

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:37.392
Maybe having to
make another movie.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.895
In case it's another failure.
Come on.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.098
Ignore him, it's all right.

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:51.606
Don't worry, I know
the people who live here.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:53.909
- I own the house.
- I'll wait here.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.610
See you in a minute.

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:06.855
The reason my
script is good is that
I know what happened.

01:02:06.857 --> 01:02:11.059
Art has to provide
the answer to the
questions that life asks.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:14.262
I know you don't agree
with me, but you are wrong.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:16.598
There is the truth,
and there is the rest.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:18.967
The killing happened here.

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:21.503
I was watching there.

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:23.872
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:24.940
What happened?

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:30.412
Joseph was in
love with Elizabeth.
He wanted her.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.534
But she didn't want him.

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:35.317
So he killed her.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.819
Like <i> Othello.</i>

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.024
Like this.

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:53.468
Sorry it's so noisy.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.303
Come with me.

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:56.772
See you in a bit.

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:58.039
See you.

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:09.351
I have decided,
you can read my script.

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:12.354
But you can't
take it away with you.

01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:15.023
I don't trust anybody
with my story.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:16.925
You have one hour, that's all.

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:31.199
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.901
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.171
You look terrible.

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:37.305
Do I?

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:44.412
Where did you go last night?

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:46.214
I was getting worried about you.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.083
Edoardo freaked me out.

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:52.988
It's so dark in here.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.859
No wonder you're depressed.

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.032
That's better.

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.967
I have something that
might cheer you up.

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:08.703
You're gonna like it.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.406
<i>La Vita Nuova.</i>

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:13.808
Thank you.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:16.645
Dante describes how he falls
in love with Beatrice.

01:05:16.647 --> 01:05:18.613
And then how she dies.

01:05:18.615 --> 01:05:20.715
For a moment,
he toys with the idea
of loving someone else,

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:23.885
but he'll never love
anyone like Beatrice.

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.821
It's so romantic.

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:30.358
All those circles of hell
in The Divine Comedy,
it's boring.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.727
Everyone getting
punished for no reason?

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:34.162
That is a book of love.

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.667
Hopefully that will
make you happy.

01:05:38.669 --> 01:05:40.602
I'm late for class.
I've gotta go.
Are you gonna be okay?

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:42.237
- Mmm-hmm.
- Promise?

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:43.838
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.128
I just want you to be happy.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.179
I'll see you later.

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:53.081
Bye.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.454
<i>"It was exactly
the ninth hour of the day</i>

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.456
<i>"when she gave me
her sweet greeting.</i>

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.693
<i>"I was filled with such
joy that I had to withdraw</i>

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:42.230

<i>"where I stood in fear

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.232
- I need your help.
- With the film?

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:40.321
With Edoardo.

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:41.956
Maybe you should
steer clear of him.

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:44.325
Maybe you were right.
Maybe he was
involved in the killing.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:45.827
- Okay, stop.
- No, listen, listen, listen.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:47.362
I think he was there.
He took me to the house.

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:48.596
He's got knives.
He saw the killing.

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:50.131
He talks a bunch of shit,
he's messing with your head.

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:51.399
No, I got to steal the knives.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:52.467
- I need you to help.
- No.

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:55.603
I need you to get them
to Rome, to a lab,
test them for DNA.

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:56.971
- No.
- I'll bring them to
you in the morning.

01:07:56.973 --> 01:07:58.339
Let go of me.

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.613
Hello, Thomas.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.549
This is Thomas.
He's a director.

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:11.453
I'm sorry I couldn't finish
your script last time.

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:12.520
Yeah, why? You disappeared.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:13.822
I felt sick.

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:15.523
Can I finish it?

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:19.928
Okay.
You'll get another chance.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:22.363
But then you must tell me
that you want to make it.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.809
One hour, okay?

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.077
Damn.

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:15.183
Shit.

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:35.957
Did you come to
my flat last night?

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:37.025
Yeah, but you weren't there.

01:11:37.027 --> 01:11:38.747
Did you take the knives
from my bed?

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:41.496
No. What... What knives?

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:43.197
Thomas, Thomas!

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:45.099
Thomas!

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:54.642
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:57.145
I wanted to know
if you read my script.

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:58.546
I didn't read your
fucking script.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:00.214
- Then you'll never
know what happened.
- Get out of here.

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:02.050
Get out of here!

01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:04.085
Have you been
looking for this, hmm?

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:06.321
Did you think you had
stumbled on the truth?

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.523
You're an idiot.

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:12.026
These are film props.
I photographed
them for my blog.

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:14.729
And you should read it.
You wouldn't be so ignorant.

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.615
- Where are the knives?
- Huh? What knife?

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:36.484
Where are the real knives?

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:41.522
Hey, hands off!

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:09.717
You really have come off
the rails, haven't you?

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.757
They're letting you go.
Let's get out of here.

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.863
You're lucky. Edoardo's
not gonna press charges.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:23.825
Says you need a doctor,
not a prison cell.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.336
Looks like you hit him
pretty hard.

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:30.905
Good.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.409
I'm going back
to Rome tomorrow.

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:37.178
Stefano, Elizabeth's
boyfriend's willing to talk.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.513
It's his first interview.

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.334
You should come with me.

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:41.849
Yep.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.851
I have to get back to work.

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:46.287
Get some rest
or something, okay?

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.769
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:22.049
<i>Have you written</i>
<i>anything yet?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:23.985
Really?

01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:25.620
Been thinking of
taking your advice.

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:27.588
Making the film fictional.

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:30.057
Setting it in Florence
as a tribute to Dante.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:32.026
Florence was the earthly
paradise he lost.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:35.830
Must be nice to have
had an earthly paradise,
even if you lose it.

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:38.566
Right?

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:45.873
I don't wanna make
a film about fear
or death or killing.

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:49.516
I want to make
a film about love.

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:58.853
<i>Yes?</i>

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:08.996
I lived in the flat
below the girls.

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:12.400
I met Elizabeth at the
beginning of the term.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:16.604
She came down in our flat
sometimes with Ana.

01:16:16.606 --> 01:16:20.007
We would hang out together,
smoke a little weed.

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:23.077
Mmm. In court, it was
made very simple.

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:27.982
That, um, Jessica was the
bad girl and Elizabeth
was the good girl.

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:29.684
She was just normal.

01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:32.253
She liked parties.
She liked having fun.

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.922
She like making love.

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:37.725
She was beautiful.

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:41.729
I didn't know her
for very long,
but I still think of her.

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.365
I will always think of her.

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:06.687
Ah, shit, I'm late.

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:08.322
I'm gonna have to pick up
the kids on the way, okay?

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:09.523
Sure.

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:22.203
Hey, you guys,
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:24.472
- Again?
- The traffic was really bad.

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:27.408
- Andrew, Will. This is Thomas.
- Hey.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:29.310
- How was your day? Good?
- Good.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:31.178
Yeah? What did you do?

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.180
Nothing much.

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:43.958
- Your taxi's here.
- Thanks for looking after me.

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:46.360
No problem.

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:47.828
Bye.

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.532
You talk to Katherine recently?

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:52.600
No.

01:17:52.602 --> 01:17:55.436
You should.
Bea is yours and hers.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:57.705
That's how it is.

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:00.047
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:02.343
Take care.

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.988
<i>Exterior. Siena. Night.</i>

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:15.790
<i>The sounds of students partying</i>

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:18.392
<i>drifts up from
the streets below.</i>

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:21.429
<i>Elizabeth hangs out with
her boyfriend, Stefano.</i>

01:18:21.431 --> 01:18:24.632
<i>Sometimes Jessica
and Carlo are there.</i>

01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:27.968
<i>They smoke weed, drink beers,
go to parties.</i>

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:29.670
<i>They're typical students.</i>

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.875
<i>Elizabeth loves art,
music, literature.</i>

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:39.580
<i>She visits the cathedral,
the galleries, the libraries.</i>

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:43.484
<i>Siena is everything
she hoped it would be.</i>

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:44.885
<i>She's happy.</i>

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.321
<i>Looking forward
to the year ahead.</i>

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.640
Back into the
belly of the beast.

01:19:06.642 --> 01:19:08.482
Yeah, let's try
and avoid that.

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:11.746
I booked you
a room in the hotel.

01:19:11.748 --> 01:19:14.014
- Keep you in the real world.
- Thanks.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.387
Heads up, verdict's at 8:00.

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:23.390
- Hey.
- -Okay.

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:46.340
We are thankful that Jessica's
nightmare is finally over,

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:49.210
and we'd like to
thank the court

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.946
for searching for the truth,

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:55.082
<i>and for overturning
this conviction.</i>

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:23.077
Justice has been done.

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:25.579
They are right
to release Jessica.

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:29.750
Uh, one young life had
been already tragically taken.

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.052
Why take another two?

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.621
Based on what?

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:37.024
Assumption by the police
and the self-interest
of the press.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:40.394
- Thank you.
- -Okay.

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:54.174
Our daughter Elizabeth
has been completely forgotten.

01:21:54.176 --> 01:21:56.944
It's... It's very hard to
find any forgiveness.

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:00.748
We know that four years
is a long time, but, um...

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:05.219
Yeah, it's still very raw.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.530
Hey.

01:22:16.532 --> 01:22:18.132
<i>- Hi, Dad.</i>
- Hi.

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.367
How are you?

01:22:20.369 --> 01:22:21.635
<i>Good.</i>

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:23.437
<i>How are you?</i>

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:24.538
I'm good.

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:27.441
<i>Is the case over?</i>

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:29.443
Yeah, it is.

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.913
<i>What happened?</i>

01:22:32.915 --> 01:22:34.581
They say they were innocent.

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:36.350
<i>That's good.</i>

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.786
I suppose so.

01:22:38.788 --> 01:22:41.989
<i>So, does that mean you're
gonna be coming home soon?</i>

01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:43.424
I hope so.

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:45.826
Is your mom there?

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.062
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:50.130
Can I talk to her?

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.933
<i>I'll see.</i>

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.502
<i>Mom?</i>

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:03.077
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Hey.

01:23:03.079 --> 01:23:04.845
- Hi.
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:07.114
I... I thought it would
be good if we talked.

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:09.483
Try to talk.

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:11.085
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:23:14.924 --> 01:23:18.492
<i>Let's, um... Let's do it
when you get back here,</i>

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:21.295
<i>because, uh, I hate
speaking like this.</i>

01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:23.664
Okay. Yep.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:25.933
<i>Good.</i>

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:29.269
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye, bye-bye.

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.739
See...

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:59.767
<i>Interior, church.
London. Day.</i>

01:23:59.769 --> 01:24:02.036
<i>Elizabeth's father reads
the funeral oration.</i>

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.540
<i>It is taken from</i>
<i>Dante's</i> La Vita Nuova.

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:11.245
<i>The power of my sighs
fills me with anguish.</i>

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.948
Many times, while
contemplating death,

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:20.721
it drains the color from
my face, and I begin to
tremble from the pain.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.193
In weeping,
I call out to Elizabeth,

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:29.930
"Can you really be dead?"

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:32.299
And just calling to her
restores my soul.

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:37.871
If anyone heard me,
they, too, would grieve.

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:40.207
And what my life has been like
since she left this earth,

01:24:40.209 --> 01:24:42.209
there is no one that can tell.

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:48.148
Elizabeth has ascended
into high heaven.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:54.955
<i>Into a place where
angels live in peace.</i>

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.863
- Have a good trip.
- Yeah, we will. I'm driving.

01:25:02.865 --> 01:25:04.998
Oh, okay.

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:07.868
Hey.

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:09.503
Hey.

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:10.871
It's all over.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:13.407
No, there's bound
to be another appeal.

01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:15.809
This one's gonna run and run.
Thank God.

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:19.813
Meanwhile, back to Rome,
and politicians with
dirty hands. You?

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:23.517
Going to Ravenna.
Sort of pilgrimage.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:25.953
Okay.

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.056
Well, have fun.

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:34.761
All right, I'm leaving.

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:39.933
Oh, you're very
welcome to carry my bag.

01:25:39.935 --> 01:25:41.101
- Bye. Bye, baby.
- See ya.

01:25:41.103 --> 01:25:43.437
- You be careful.
- Yes, I will be very careful.

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:47.441
Hello.

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:48.642
Hi.

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:51.278
Just getting the car.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.880
Cool.

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:57.151
Look at
those mountains.
Beautiful.

01:25:57.153 --> 01:25:59.073
I imagine you as a skier.
Do you go skiing?

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:00.721
Yeah, I do.

01:26:00.723 --> 01:26:02.823
- I'm a snowboarder.
- Of course.

01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:04.424
Why of course?
What does that mean?

01:26:04.426 --> 01:26:05.692
You look like a snowboarder.

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:07.027
I look like a snowboarder?

01:26:07.029 --> 01:26:08.662
Yeah.
Young, hip and cool.

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.197
Really?

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.608
Yeah. Jovanotti.

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:23.477
- Do you know Jovanotti?
- No.

01:26:23.479 --> 01:26:25.812
Do you not?

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.749
What a dump.

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:04.751
No wonder Dante was
homesick for Tuscany.

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:08.755
It's so flat.

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:13.460
- Did you actually read it?
- Yeah.

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:18.565
"O you who on the road
of love pass by,

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:21.802
"attend and see if any grief
there be as heavy as mine."

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:25.372
There are two different endings.

01:27:25.374 --> 01:27:27.474
The original version,
he ends up with a new wife.

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:31.912
But later, he re-wrote it
to stay true to Beatrice.

01:27:31.914 --> 01:27:33.680
I prefer that ending.

01:27:33.682 --> 01:27:35.315
'Cause you're a teenager.

01:27:35.317 --> 01:27:37.651
I'm not a teenager,
I'm an adult.

01:27:37.653 --> 01:27:38.952
Twenty-one.

01:27:38.954 --> 01:27:40.687
But you behave like a child.

01:27:58.006 --> 01:28:00.641
It's incredible.
Dante's body is in there.

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:02.476
So how old is it?

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:04.678
Seven hundred years.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:09.483
Enough Dante. Enough death.
Let's go.

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.521
- You want some?
- No, it's okay.

01:28:14.523 --> 01:28:17.891
Come on, you have to try it.
It's so good, please.

01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:28.001
It's funny, I used to go to
Dorset when I was younger.

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:30.537
My mom and dad,
they always took us to a beach

01:28:30.539 --> 01:28:32.839
and made us walk for hours.

01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:35.542
I never wanted to go 'cause
it was so freezing and windy.

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:40.113
They said it was good for us.

01:28:40.115 --> 01:28:43.417
Now I love it, but then,
I just wanted to stay home.

01:28:43.419 --> 01:28:45.285
Do you see them much?

01:28:45.287 --> 01:28:48.522
Yeah, when I go back to
London. They're crazy.

01:28:48.524 --> 01:28:50.824
They drove each other mad,
so they're separated now.

01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:53.327
- It's definitely better.
- Hmm.

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:56.296
- What about yours?
- Still together.

01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:58.098
Amazing.

01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.580
- Yep.
- How long for?

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:03.503
- Almost 50 years.
- No way.

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.005
Yeah.

01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:06.106
One second, wait here.

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:10.610
Ciao.

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.731
- It's a present.
- No way.

01:29:30.733 --> 01:29:32.866
Why? Come on.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:34.634
Are you scared?

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:40.774
Come on.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:46.780
Are you sure?

01:29:46.782 --> 01:29:48.315
What do you mean, am I sure?

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.118
Oh...

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.788
Don't be scared.

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:56.757
It's so warm.

01:29:56.759 --> 01:29:58.558
- Is it?
- It's like, oh, my God.

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.311
- Come on!
- Swim!

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:08.668
Swim like a dolphin!

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:14.374
Fuck you!

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:16.610
You swim, you prick.

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:49.976
Hi, Steve.

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:52.279
Well, hello, I've been
calling you for days.

01:30:52.281 --> 01:30:54.815
- I'm in Italy.
<i>- Still?</i>

01:30:54.817 --> 01:30:57.250
Yeah. Flying home tomorrow.

01:30:57.252 --> 01:30:59.386
<i>Well, that's good,
'cause, um, we need to meet.</i>

01:30:59.388 --> 01:31:01.588
Not London. LA.

01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:05.892
Okay, uh,
listen, mate, we've...
We've moved on.

01:31:05.894 --> 01:31:07.627
<i>Caroline insisted.
They want to make the film</i>

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:10.797
<i>before it's too late</i>
<i>and the heat's gone out</i>
<i>of the story, I'm sorry.</i>

01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:12.966
But listen, when you get
back to London, let's, uh,

01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:14.701
let's talk about
this face to face.

01:31:14.703 --> 01:31:17.003
I won't be back for a while.

01:31:17.005 --> 01:31:18.638
<i>But look, I am really sorry.</i>

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:23.310
Don't need to be sorry.
Good luck with it.

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:24.778
<i>Thanks, mate.</i>

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.879
Bye.

01:31:25.881 --> 01:31:27.714
<i>Cheers, we'll speak soon.</i>

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:38.692
Hi.

01:31:39.795 --> 01:31:41.161
How much is a single room?

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:42.496
150 euros.

01:31:42.498 --> 01:31:43.964
And how much for a double?

01:31:43.966 --> 01:31:45.899
The same.
You pay for the room.

01:31:45.901 --> 01:31:47.661
It's fine. We'll just
get one room.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.570
It's all right, I trust you.

01:31:50.572 --> 01:31:52.706
Can I take your
credit card, please?

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.410
Okay,
check how many
cards you've got.

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.080
That's fine.

01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:05.131
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:08.788
Wait a sec. Uh...

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:11.892
On there. On there. On there.

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:15.295
Oh, my God.

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:16.563
Hold on.

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:19.466
- No! Ugh!
- Yes!

01:32:19.468 --> 01:32:21.034
Spit!

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:26.907
What the fuck?
I mean, it was...

01:32:30.611 --> 01:32:32.145
Ah, stop it.

01:32:32.147 --> 01:32:34.147
- Spit!
- Ugh.

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:38.385
One, two, three.

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:49.029
- Spit.
- Spit.

01:32:49.031 --> 01:32:51.298
Yeah but I did
this one, it's mine.

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.166
- No?
- Why did I choose this one?

01:32:53.168 --> 01:32:54.968
They're basically equal then.

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:08.008
"Beatrice looked at me
and her eyes were full

01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:13.947
"of sparks, of love, of such
divinity that, vanquished,

01:34:13.949 --> 01:34:17.283
"my virtue ran away
and I was as if lost.

01:34:17.285 --> 01:34:19.352
"My eyes lowered."

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.631
What do you miss about home?

01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:34.634
I miss my family, a lot.

01:34:34.636 --> 01:34:38.738
But, apart from that, um,

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:43.009
bad weather,
and fish and chips,

01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:46.479
and pie and mash,
and the tube,

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:52.018
and I don't know what else.

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:58.358
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.428
<i>The power of my sighs
fills me with anguish.</i>

01:35:02.697 --> 01:35:04.931
And weeping,
I call out to Elizabeth,

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:08.435
"Can you really be dead?"

01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:12.005
<i>And just calling to her
restores my soul.</i>

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:18.044
If anyone heard me,
they, too, would grieve.

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:23.083
And what my life has been like
since she left this earth,

01:35:23.085 --> 01:35:24.718
there is no one that can tell.

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:31.091
Elizabeth has ascended
into high heaven.

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:37.997
Into a place where
angels live in peace.
