01:19.580 --> 01:20.912
Help!

01:22.124 --> 01:23.911
Someone help!

01:25.085 --> 01:26.075
Help!

02:48.960 --> 02:50.997
<i>Paging Dr Jones.</i>

02:51.046 --> 02:53.413
<i>- Paging Dr Jones.</i>
- Lee.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.707
Lee, you know I can only help you

02:55.759 --> 02:58.092
if you're willing to take a step
towards me, Lee.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.297
I thought that we had an understanding.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.215
Was I wrong?

03:05.435 --> 03:09.179
People need my help for
all sorts of reasons.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.393
Some have broken hearts...

03:12.567 --> 03:14.854
...others have broken heads.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.771
Then there's those too young
to know better...

03:19.866 --> 03:22.779
...those running away from their past...

03:23.954 --> 03:26.446
...and those who are just lost.

03:26.498 --> 03:30.208
Until you can tell me which one you are,
we're done.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.044
We'll review things again
in six months' time.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.627
Craig, if you could please
take Lee to the ward.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.836
Certainly, Dr Jones.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.044
Morning, Fred.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.712
Be back with you in a minute.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.757
You can put some clothes back on, Rosie.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.095
Morning, Lee.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.031
Er... This is a crime scene.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.791
I live right there.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.549
Oi, where you heading?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.223
That way.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.558
Where you goin'?

05:17.609 --> 05:18.895
Don't know.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.979
Need a ride?

05:24.866 --> 05:26.152
No thanks.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.033
It's gonna rain.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.621
There's a lotta weird people around here,
ya know?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.498
Yeah, I bet.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.661
This is a lonely road.
You'll wait ages for another lift.

05:48.932 --> 05:53.267
Excuse me, how much longer will this take?
I... I have other patients to attend to.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.303
It takes as long as it takes, Dr Jones.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.474
Bearing in mind that you run one of
the most secure facilities in the country,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.813
how could one of your most
dangerous inmates escape?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.775
They're not inmates, they're...
they're, they're patients.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.860
They need treatment, they're ill.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.525
Lee Hunting, born October 31st 1985.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.116
Quiet child, never really bonded with
other children.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.495
While a teenager... Excuse me!

06:13.540 --> 06:16.123
Quiet child, never really bonded
with other children,

06:16.167 --> 06:19.501
something about throwing darts
at their backs in the playground.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.710
While a teenager, developed
a bit of a thing for knives,

06:22.757 --> 06:24.248
self-harming for practice

06:24.301 --> 06:28.341
before turning the blades on four family
members on Christmas Day 2002.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.847
I guess the Queen's speech brings out
the worst in all of us, ma'am.

06:33.935 --> 06:37.804
Just shy of the 18th birthday,
treated as a minor,

06:37.856 --> 06:40.473
and kept in the cushy confines
of an establishment such as yours.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.983
- All right, that's enough.
- Instead of rotting in a class A prison

06:43.028 --> 06:45.065
- along with all other murderous nutters.
- Excuse me,

06:45.113 --> 06:48.356
but we try to help our patients live out
normal lives as much as they can.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.195
We try not to dwell too much on the past,

06:50.243 --> 06:54.078
and we certainly don't like to call
our patients murderous nutters.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.159
Call them what you wish, Dr Jones.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.541
This dangerous individual is now free on
my patch because of you,

06:59.586 --> 07:02.624
so excuse me if I'm being a little
curt with you today,

07:02.672 --> 07:06.461
but I've got nutters to catch,
people to protect,

07:06.509 --> 07:10.093
and in my experience, time is everything,
so stop cocking me around

07:10.138 --> 07:12.050
- and let me do my fucking job.
- You have no idea...

07:12.098 --> 07:14.806
what you're getting yourself into.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.103
Henry, you can give us
another chance, right?

07:23.151 --> 07:26.770
I will promise you that the company
will make it worth your while.

07:26.821 --> 07:30.861
Look, Tim, you're a nice guy, mate,
but I've had enough.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.026
You and me, we do a deal on prices,

07:33.078 --> 07:36.116
but then that cock boss of yours, Derrick,
moves the goalpost

07:36.164 --> 07:37.826
every time an invoice shows up.

07:37.874 --> 07:42.164
When I complain, he either sends me
an unsigned cheque

07:42.212 --> 07:45.205
or one with the wrong fucking year on it,
so I can't even cash it.

07:47.008 --> 07:51.548
Right, okay, well look, Henry,
I am very sorry about that.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.132
It's not your fault, Tim.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.140
To be honest, we all feel a bit sorry
for you around here.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.803
Workin' for an arsehole like that
can't be easy, but...

08:00.897 --> 08:02.809
...I've gotta protect my business.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.315
Quite right, Henry, quite right.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.606
Okay, but listen, what if I...?

08:08.655 --> 08:12.569
Your delivery guys only deliver
in this area on a Wednesday.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.568
I play golf on a Wednesday.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.246
- Could someone else not be here to...?
- No.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.573
Toddle off.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.318
Why have we stopped?

08:49.362 --> 08:53.732
Regulations. Can only drive for so long
without takin' a break, it's the law.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.452
Thanks for the ride.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.158
You got a name?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.408
Zoe.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.543
Pretty.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.711
I should really get going.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.216
What's the rush?

09:13.344 --> 09:14.460
- No!
- Oh yeah.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.878
No, stop!

09:15.930 --> 09:17.717
Stop!

09:17.766 --> 09:19.098
Help!

09:52.383 --> 09:54.045
Hello, Dexter.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.474
I was surprised you wanted to see me, Max.

10:02.894 --> 10:05.102
Of course I wanted to see ya.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.765
I just always assumed that you probably
blamed me for what happened with Molly.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.268
You know, there's...

10:13.696 --> 10:16.029
There's not a day goes by
when I don't think about Molly.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.947
She was my daughter.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.408
My only daughter.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.708
You were like a son.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.211
Losin' her like that was, no...

10:31.256 --> 10:32.246
tears me apart.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.382
Me too.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.463
But you have to move on, don't you?

10:37.512 --> 10:39.674
That's the way she woulda wanted.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.217
One million pounds.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.680
What?

10:45.728 --> 10:50.644
In two days' time, a jeep will be passing
through here on its way to the airport.

10:50.692 --> 10:54.185
Onboard is six million pounds.

10:54.237 --> 10:58.322
Our European cousins, they're movin'
some assets offshore.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.403
At least that's what they think.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.613
I want you to steal it.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.321
How'd you even know about it?

11:05.373 --> 11:08.241
And our money ain't
what it used to be, Dex,

11:08.293 --> 11:12.253
but you can still do a lot
with a million pounds.

11:14.299 --> 11:17.542
You can move away from
all these bad memories.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.678
Go somewhere warm, buy yourself a bar,

11:20.722 --> 11:23.089
spend the rest of your days
drinkin' the profits.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.096
You just got to do one last job.

11:27.645 --> 11:28.726
Who gets the rest?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.262
Me.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.898
Oh, and the tip, of course.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.018
My own crew?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.441
You can take Al and that lunatic Topic.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.531
The other side want two
of their people on.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.038
Just in case, ya know?

11:48.082 --> 11:49.914
Guys I've never worked with?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.624
Not exactly.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.774
How'd it go with, er...?

12:15.818 --> 12:17.104
- Probation?
- Mm.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.779
Twenty minutes of playbook
before cuttin' me a benefits slip,

12:20.823 --> 12:23.691
tellin' me to keep out of trouble
and away from bad influences.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.860
You come to the wrong place then, mate.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.905
Oh, Jesus Christ!

12:29.958 --> 12:31.574
Not quite.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.673
Dex.

12:50.144 --> 12:54.229
So... how was Her Majesty's pleasure?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.061
Was she as good for you as she was for me?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.732
You remember Al.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.442
Hm...

13:02.490 --> 13:04.903
Done some time with you, no?

13:06.244 --> 13:09.783
Gotta say, Max really knows
how to pick the best of the bunch.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.159
So, Dex, you up to this, yeah?

13:15.211 --> 13:17.669
Hey, we'll get the job done.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.914
Who are you?

13:19.966 --> 13:22.049
- This is, er...
- Duffy.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.300
Duffy.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.677
Where's Topic, Duffy?

13:25.722 --> 13:27.304
He's in the car.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.011
Don't worry about nuttin',
finish up your drink.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.599
They say if you're gonna drink
with the devil,

13:34.647 --> 13:37.105
sup from a very short spoon.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.352
I'm done. Let's get on with it.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.323
It's long spoon. Let's go.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.925
Oh, dear God, okay, well let's just go
through this again then one more time.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.427
Oh, how many fuckin' times?

14:07.472 --> 14:10.340
As many times as it takes, Topic.
I don't like to take chances.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.849
It's like the education rooms
in the clink.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.102
Some know-it-all givin' it all that.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.558
Fuck's sake!

14:17.607 --> 14:18.688
Do you wanna go back?

14:18.733 --> 14:20.770
I hear you're missed in the showers.

14:20.818 --> 14:21.808
I don't.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.863
So we just keep goin' through this
until we get it right, yeah?

14:25.907 --> 14:26.943
I'm just sayin'...

14:26.991 --> 14:29.950
We've been through it
a million times already.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.735
We know what we have to do, yeah?

14:31.788 --> 14:34.826
Really? All right. What's that?

14:39.629 --> 14:42.167
Look, why don't we just
keep this simple?

14:42.215 --> 14:45.333
The security van with the money
approaches from the southeast.

14:45.385 --> 14:51.052
While you, Dexter, you run interference,
and Al here pretends he's directing Topic.

14:51.099 --> 14:54.683
Then, you knock out the driver and
his mate,

14:54.727 --> 14:57.344
while I make sure he doesn't think about
reversin' out of there.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.515
Boys give up the keys, eat the dirt.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.775
We lift the coins, get the fuck out,

15:03.820 --> 15:07.985
come back here, divvy it up, and split.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.864
Always about the money, eh?

15:10.952 --> 15:13.160
You make it sound so simple, Fordy.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.742
It is so simple, Dex.

15:15.790 --> 15:19.830
Not unless you're feelin' a bit rusty.
Wanna call Max, find someone else?

15:21.003 --> 15:25.964
Otherwise, you do your job, we do ours.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.846
24 hours.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.520
Okay, that's enough, people.

15:40.565 --> 15:43.228
Mouths shut and ears open.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.275
We are 18 hours in.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.984
And so far, we have no sightings,
no leads,

15:50.032 --> 15:54.948
and the time is rapidly approaching
before something fucking big happens.

15:54.996 --> 16:00.367
Let me remind you that Lee Hunting
is a cold, callous, pathological killer.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.331
Forget what the white-coat do-gooders say.

16:03.379 --> 16:08.044
We're dealing with a homicidal psychopath
who kills without remorse or reason.

16:08.092 --> 16:12.553
Any form of sexual contact has
historically triggered a violent response.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.635
After what some thought had become
a deep and friendly relationship,

16:15.683 --> 16:19.142
one inmate got a little fresh with Lee
and got their throat cut.

16:19.187 --> 16:23.056
We have a long list of assaulted
prison guards, police officers,

16:23.107 --> 16:26.771
and it's only a matter of time
before Hunting kills.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.946
I know you're tired, people,
but caffeine up.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.363
Nobody is going home till we find
the trail of breadcrumbs.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.330
- What a bitch!
- Telling me!

18:02.039 --> 18:04.201
I can't believe it.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.038
I saw Mrs Jenner in here only yesterday.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.998
Her cleaning lady found her.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.753
She's very upset.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.882
I'm not surprised.
I know it's worrying, but what can we do?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.963
Well, what are the police gonna do
about it?

18:16.012 --> 18:17.924
I'm sure the police are doing
all they can.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.464
But this is the third one in a month.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.634
It's all right for you,
but I live on my own.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.393
We have our very own serial killer.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.395
Now, we don't know that.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.932
They found the woman
tied up and mutilated.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.567
Doesn't sound like the <i>Kama Sutra</i>
goin' wrong to me.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.728
Nor me.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.192
Who said she was mutilated?

18:37.241 --> 18:40.234
Her cleaner did.
She said there was blood everywhere.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.203
It must be an outsider.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.326
What must?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.785
The killer must be.

18:46.834 --> 18:47.870
Why?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.831
Because we all know each other
around here.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.667
It has to be someone new.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.299
Elliott, I've told you before

18:59.347 --> 19:02.215
not to throw the papers onto
the driveway or gardens.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.474
This isn't some American suburb.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.511
Take them up to the front door and
post them through the letterbox

19:07.563 --> 19:09.429
or find another job.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.650
- Nigel.
- Yes.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.986
Wonder if you can help me.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.794
Yeah, yes, I'm on my way there now.
Yeah.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.258
But, Derrick, sorry, um,
what's the guy's name again?

19:42.306 --> 19:45.674
Don't fuck this up, Tim, all right?
We need this contract.

19:45.726 --> 19:49.219
No contract, you don't get paid, ever,
comprende?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.638
Comprende, comprende,
I will not fuck up.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.432
I promise, Derrick, I swear for...

19:53.484 --> 19:55.646
<i>Derrick?</i>

19:55.695 --> 19:57.027
Derrick?

19:58.114 --> 20:00.857
Oh, Suse, how about a nosh-off
before lunch, hm?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.942
Fuck off, Derrick.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.581
Each time, the killer forces entry
via the back door

20:09.625 --> 20:13.414
before making his way through the kitchen
into the rest of the house.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.042
He enters the victim's bedroom
while they sleep,

20:17.091 --> 20:18.457
injects them with a sedative

20:18.509 --> 20:22.719
before butchering them methodically
with some sort of large knife.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.470
Victims are always alone,

20:24.515 --> 20:29.431
implying highly selective identification
of the victims and surveillance.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.936
Oh shit!

20:45.786 --> 20:48.403
Listen, do you think we should
get the press involved now?

20:48.456 --> 20:50.823
Like I don't have enough fucking problems.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.242
DS Binon, a word?

20:53.294 --> 20:55.536
Yeah, you can have two - fuck off!

20:55.588 --> 20:57.671
I just need to talk
to Officer Jackson.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.206
Elliott?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.215
It's all right, this is my nephew.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.671
You okay?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.133
Yeah, there's a man in our village.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.922
I think he's the serial killer.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.090
Right.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.223
He's the local gardener.
I think he killed that woman.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.313
I don't have time for this
right now, okay?

21:15.357 --> 21:16.393
But he's really scary.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.775
Yeah, so's my boss,
but I can't arrest her, can I?

21:18.819 --> 21:20.060
Now, bugger off.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.450
Fuck Derrick!

21:37.797 --> 21:39.413
Yeah fuckin' right. Yeah.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.049
Perfect, of course.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.223
Thanks for stoppin', man.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.184
Been there, right, for ever.
Thought no one was gonna stop.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.524
Right.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.104
Sorry, where is it you're going?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.394
Insane, mate.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.529
- Where?
- Any place but here, yeah?

22:06.700 --> 22:07.941
My name's Lewis, yeah.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.529
Sorry... Tim.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.656
Oh, er, Lewis...

22:13.707 --> 22:16.415
It's just because it's a...

22:16.460 --> 22:19.203
- Uh, it's a company car.
- Company car, thank you.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.541
Sorry.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.921
Thank you.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.509
Fuck it.

22:27.596 --> 22:31.215
So Tim, what do you do,
for a livin', I mean?

22:31.267 --> 22:33.475
I'm a rep for a beer company.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.680
Really?

22:34.728 --> 22:36.094
Yeah, why?

22:36.146 --> 22:37.762
Don't look like the salesman type to me.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.977
I'll take that as a compliment.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.689
Still, it must be great,
all that free booze, eh?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.399
No, I don't drink, so...

22:45.447 --> 22:47.939
You're fucking joking me.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.028
Why?

22:49.076 --> 22:51.113
What's the point havin' a job
selling booze, right,

22:51.161 --> 22:53.995
if you can't take advantage
of the perks, hm?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.746
Yeah, I suppose.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.204
- You hungry?
- Um, but I don't know anywhere

22:58.252 --> 22:59.493
around here that we could, er...

22:59.545 --> 23:02.162
Sure ya do, Timmy.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.071
Hello.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.236
Hi.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.868
Oh no, please don't hurt me!

24:18.916 --> 24:20.748
I've got a wife and kids.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.250
Yeah, of course you do.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.580
Give me your wallet.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.207
PIN number.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.423
And your fucking car keys.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.929
Here, here, here.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.429
Now then, Mr Michael Simpson...

24:41.480 --> 24:43.813
if you breathe a word of this
to the police,

24:43.857 --> 24:47.100
I'm gonna tell your wife and kids
your dirty little secret.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.729
All right, Mickey?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.709
So, let me get this straight.

25:46.754 --> 25:52.500
This Derrick here, this bloodsucking
wanker of a boss, right,

25:52.551 --> 25:54.338
who doesn't give a shit about his staff,

25:54.386 --> 25:56.343
undermines you, right,

25:56.388 --> 26:00.473
makes your work like a twat
night and day, yeah,

26:00.517 --> 26:04.602
and then, right, threatens you with
the sack because he's fucked up?

26:09.860 --> 26:11.442
That's about it.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.275
Pathetic, isn't it?

26:15.324 --> 26:17.190
That's one word for it.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.235
You need to stand up
for yourself, mate, yeah?

26:28.921 --> 26:31.004
This is how you deal with pricks, Tim.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.647
We going in then or what?

26:51.485 --> 26:53.477
Come on, Timmy.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.864
Nice fuckin' work, Dex.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.869
You're not outta the woods yet.

27:03.914 --> 27:07.032
AI's right, let's not get
ahead of ourselves, yeah?

27:09.378 --> 27:10.494
Duffy!

27:10.546 --> 27:11.753
What?

27:11.797 --> 27:13.504
What the fuck was that all about earlier?

27:13.549 --> 27:16.917
No witnesses. One person knows
and everyone knows.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.928
Who the fuck was she
gonna tell, her priest?

27:19.972 --> 27:21.634
No loose ends, Dexter.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.808
Al...

27:28.856 --> 27:30.097
No!

27:32.317 --> 27:35.560
What the fuck is goin' on, Fordy?

27:36.780 --> 27:40.615
Don't be so naive.
I just want the money.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.531
Afraid I can't do that for you, mate.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.136
Do you want a drink?

28:49.811 --> 28:51.177
My name's Sharice.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.768
- Oh.
- What's yours?

29:01.240 --> 29:02.822
Are you on your own?

29:04.868 --> 29:06.655
Sorry?

29:10.457 --> 29:11.914
Are you on your own?

29:17.130 --> 29:19.668
No, no, sorry, um... I'm, I'm just er...

29:19.716 --> 29:21.503
My, my, my, my friend...

29:21.551 --> 29:23.759
Er... I came with Lewis.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.841
He's my friend, he's coming back.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.386
Oh God! My name's Julie.

29:33.438 --> 29:37.057
Don't mind if sit down, do you?
I've been standing all night.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.477
- You want a drink, Judy?
- It's Julie.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.197
Oh, yours, all right.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.832
So what do you do, Julie?

29:56.628 --> 29:59.245
I'm a dancer.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.376
Julie...

30:01.425 --> 30:05.135
Julie, do you fancy a fuck?

30:05.178 --> 30:09.092
Mm. Ah, ah, ooh.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.178
Sure!

30:12.227 --> 30:14.719
I'll just pop to the ladies'.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.609
What do you reckon then, eh, Timmy?

30:27.117 --> 30:28.107
Really?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.617
Oh yes, Timmy.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.825
Well, yeah but... It's just, um...

30:34.207 --> 30:37.075
There's just one problem, isn't there?
That there's, um...

30:37.127 --> 30:40.916
There's only one of her
and there's two of us.

30:40.964 --> 30:45.425
You fucking plum!
We're both gonna fuck her.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.836
- You serious?
- Fucking deadly serious, matey.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.426
Come on, it'll be fun.
What's wrong with you?

30:52.517 --> 30:54.600
- Okay.
- Good lad.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.978
Can I go second?

30:59.691 --> 31:03.435
Al, talk to me fella, come on.

31:03.487 --> 31:04.898
Just leave me here.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.562
You get out.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.732
Shut up you, you fool, ain't leavin' ya.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.527
- We've been driving for hours.
- Minutes, mate.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.366
I just need to find somewhere
to get you patched up.

31:15.749 --> 31:19.038
What, what are you gonna do
with your, your money, Al?

31:20.587 --> 31:22.795
Al, Al.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.293
Fuck!

31:29.763 --> 31:30.799
Fuck.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.477
Yes, oh fuckin' yes, come on now.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.017
Who's the best, eh?

31:44.069 --> 31:46.231
- Who's the fucking daddy?
<i>- Keep the noise down!</i>

31:46.279 --> 31:48.942
- Come on! Oh yeah, that's right!
- Lewis...

31:48.990 --> 31:50.697
- Fuckin' come on!
- Lewis.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.903
- Oh yes!
- Lewis.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.614
- That's right!
- Lewis!

31:53.662 --> 31:54.869
What is it, mate?

31:54.913 --> 31:57.451
Sorry, it's just that
the neighbours next door,

31:57.499 --> 31:59.035
they're complainin' about the noise.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.497
The fuckin' neighbours?
Don't worry about them.

32:01.545 --> 32:04.413
Oh, do you, do you wanna go now, mate?

32:04.464 --> 32:06.877
No, I'm, no thank you.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.336
Suit yourself.

32:08.385 --> 32:12.379
Fuckin' come on, come up here,
that's right, yes!

32:12.431 --> 32:15.720
Take it, take it up the wrong 'un,
oh God!

32:15.767 --> 32:17.975
Come on now, girl, come on!

32:18.019 --> 32:21.228
That's right, oh come on! God, oh!

32:24.192 --> 32:26.024
What's happened now?

32:26.069 --> 32:27.435
Nothing.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.150
Well, don't give me that.
You've got a face like a smacked ass.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.279
And?

32:34.661 --> 32:37.495
- You argue with Adele again?
- Don't wanna talk about it, okay?

32:37.539 --> 32:38.825
Fine.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.750
So, how was college?

32:47.799 --> 32:48.960
Usual, crap.

32:49.009 --> 32:52.343
Thomas, you could try to sound interested
in something,

32:52.387 --> 32:53.969
instead of being angry all the time.

32:54.014 --> 32:58.884
Let's just think about that for a second,
shall we? Why am I angry?

32:58.935 --> 33:02.099
Mum and Dad are dead,
we're about to be evicted,

33:02.147 --> 33:03.809
and if I'm lucky, in a few months,

33:03.857 --> 33:06.349
I'll leave college, work on
someone else's farm

33:06.401 --> 33:09.360
while they change ours into some sort
of housing estate.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.940
It's not all about you.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.857
Who's that? It's so late.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.492
Hang on, I'll just use my X-ray vision
to see through the door.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.653
Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.

33:22.626 --> 33:25.039
All I'm saying is nothing good
ever happens.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.794
In fact, nothing interesting
ever happens to us.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.796
Sorry to trouble you,
but we need some help.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.469
Fuck.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.510
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

33:41.561 --> 33:44.804
- Oh shit!
- Is he dead?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.314
Not yet, darling.

33:48.610 --> 33:50.317
How you doing, kiddo?

33:50.362 --> 33:53.105
Musta been one hell of a party, eh?

33:57.661 --> 33:58.651
So what do you want?

34:02.999 --> 34:04.740
What's your name?

34:04.793 --> 34:08.081
Martine. He's my brother Thomas.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.996
Martine...

34:13.217 --> 34:16.177
We've had... bit of an accident.

34:16.221 --> 34:20.340
We just need somewhere to lay low for
the night and get him stitched up.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.257
Why didn't you go to a hospital?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.677
Well, you see, Thomas,
it's a gunshot wound,

34:24.728 --> 34:26.311
and hospitals have got a funny habit

34:26.356 --> 34:29.268
of calling the police when a patient
rocks up with a gunshot wound.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.021
- Where are your parents?
- Dead.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.655
Anybody else here?

34:38.076 --> 34:40.318
- No one.
- Girlfriend?

34:40.370 --> 34:42.407
Aunts, uncles?

34:42.455 --> 34:44.447
Boyfriend?

34:44.498 --> 34:46.239
No, we live alone.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.409
As I say, we're in a bit of a pickle.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.952
We're not here to hurt you.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.088
I just wanna get him
patched up and lay low.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.715
You help us out, we'll be gone
first thing in the morning,

34:54.759 --> 34:55.795
no harm done, I promise.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.460
No harm done?

34:58.930 --> 35:01.513
You just showed up at our door
wavin' your gun around.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.847
We've got a half dead man
on our dining room table.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.770
You could be anyone.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.814
What's your point?

35:10.859 --> 35:13.397
I don't want you in our house,

35:13.445 --> 35:16.358
I don't want you near my brother,
and I certainly don't want you near me.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.068
Point taken.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.574
We'll be gone in the mornin'.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.030
What do you want us to do?

35:23.913 --> 35:25.279
Can you drive?

35:25.332 --> 35:28.040
- Well, I don't have my licence.
- You're not driving anywhere.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.746
Don't worry about what she's saying.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.286
Are you capable of driving my car
from where it is

35:32.339 --> 35:33.921
to out of sight round the back?

35:35.342 --> 35:36.503
Yeah.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.759
Will you do that for me, please?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.051
Okay.

35:44.517 --> 35:48.557
Martine, I'm gonna need you to get me
some needle, thread, tweezers,

35:48.605 --> 35:51.689
and the sharpest knife
you can find, and...

35:51.733 --> 35:54.817
some of your finest
sanitary towels, please.

35:54.861 --> 35:56.397
Now.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.332
You are joking.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.618
No.

36:53.670 --> 36:57.334
You really gonna take a bullet out of his
shoulder with a craft knife and tweezers?

36:57.382 --> 36:58.714
Yeah.

36:58.758 --> 37:02.672
And you're gonna stitch him up
with fishing wire and a tampon?

37:02.721 --> 37:04.087
Tampon?

37:04.139 --> 37:05.721
- Yeah.
- Cool.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.007
Agh, fuckin' hell!

37:08.059 --> 37:10.597
I'm just cleanin' it, mate,
I'm just cleanin' it.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.311
- Drink some of this.
- You sure about this?

37:19.988 --> 37:22.526
Not really mate, but what the fuck else
we gonna do?

37:29.289 --> 37:32.782
- Woo, you ready?
- Yeah.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.826
- Let's fuckin' do it.
- Wait.

37:34.878 --> 37:37.291
Wait, have you done this before?

37:37.338 --> 37:38.874
No.

37:38.923 --> 37:42.257
Well, then, give it to me.
I've got training.

37:42.302 --> 37:43.463
- Really?
- Yes.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.503
Well, what sort of training you got?

37:45.555 --> 37:47.512
You like a doctor, a nurse or something,
what?

37:47.557 --> 37:48.673
Vet.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.307
Sorry, did you say vet?

37:50.351 --> 37:52.092
- Yes.
- Right.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.513
You did something like this before?

37:57.358 --> 37:58.474
Similar.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.353
On horses.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.146
Horses?

38:28.723 --> 38:30.259
Got it.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.359
Thanks for that.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.769
Thanks a lot.

38:45.406 --> 38:48.149
I, er, I need a phone.

38:48.201 --> 38:50.989
But I can't find one.
I've been lookin' everywhere.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.370
We don't have a phone, it got cut off.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.030
Right.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.450
Where's the nearest phone box then?

38:59.587 --> 39:01.795
About a mile and a half down the road.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.252
You got a car?

39:10.431 --> 39:13.299
My mum's old Jeep is
parked around the back.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.392
Good, okay, good.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.020
We leave in five minutes.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.977
Do I have a choice?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.687
No, no you don't.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.904
Farmhouse?

39:27.949 --> 39:30.111
- Anybody hurt?
- Yeah he's hurt pretty bad.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.194
<i>Will he make it?</i>

39:33.246 --> 39:36.785
Yeah, he's tough as old boots.
He's gonna make it, but...

39:36.833 --> 39:38.825
We can't hang around here.
We need an out.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.460
Turn your phone on at 7.00am
for 10 minutes.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.873
I'll text you details.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.133
Oh, and Dexter, don't trust anyone.

39:49.304 --> 39:52.047
Yeah, I hear you.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.240
So word from the boss.

40:12.285 --> 40:15.744
You find Dex and his bum boy Al...

40:15.788 --> 40:17.871
you keep his share of the money.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.874
How much?

40:20.919 --> 40:24.879
Don't know, the bastards bumped us
before we got a chance to count it.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.382
But about six million
supposedly in the van.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.177
Al was injured.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.931
Now, if I was injured, I'd hole up
somewhere unexpected for the night,

40:35.975 --> 40:39.184
get myself sorted then I'd push on
in the morning.

40:40.313 --> 40:44.478
Got a couple of shots in the fuel tank,
so they wouldn't have got far.

40:46.319 --> 40:48.185
It's a pretty isolated area.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.401
Just do the rounds.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.784
So what's your story?

41:07.006 --> 41:08.417
Why do you wanna know?

41:11.094 --> 41:14.713
Well, you've taken my brother and I
hostage in our own home.

41:14.764 --> 41:17.427
I think we deserve some kind
of explanation.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.805
Yeah, fair enough.

41:22.730 --> 41:27.270
Um, I guess what you really need to know
is that Al and I pulled a job today.

41:28.611 --> 41:32.150
Our associates were greedy
and they tried to kill us.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.238
Didn't work, but Al did get shot

41:36.285 --> 41:39.619
and that is how we came to be
at your house tonight.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.372
And I'm truly sorry about that.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.982
Nice watch.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.269
Thanks, my girlfriend...

42:11.320 --> 42:14.688
Sorry, my ex-girlfriend gave it to me.

42:14.741 --> 42:16.448
That was nice of her.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.778
Shame though.

42:17.827 --> 42:19.443
What is?

42:19.495 --> 42:21.452
Girl like that bought me a watch,

42:21.497 --> 42:24.285
I'd be pretty pissed off
if she then dumped me.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.790
As it happens, I dumped her.

42:25.835 --> 42:27.451
Why?

42:27.503 --> 42:29.290
I don't wanna talk about it.

42:29.338 --> 42:31.421
She, er, stole money off ya?

42:32.717 --> 42:33.707
No.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.468
She fucked your best friend?

42:38.389 --> 42:40.130
- Did you fuck her best friend?
- No!

42:40.183 --> 42:41.390
Well, what then?

42:42.560 --> 42:45.473
If you must know, she wasn't a virgin.

42:46.981 --> 42:49.564
And that makes a difference to you?

42:49.609 --> 42:51.896
Yes, it does.

42:51.944 --> 42:56.689
Let me, er... explain a little theory
of mine to ya.

42:59.410 --> 43:02.448
Suppose all you'd ever eaten
was McDonald's,

43:02.497 --> 43:04.955
you were very happy with your McDonald's,

43:04.999 --> 43:08.413
until one day you walk past a Burger King.

43:08.461 --> 43:10.578
Now these Burger Kings look great,

43:10.630 --> 43:12.872
but you stay loyal to your McDonald's,

43:12.924 --> 43:17.339
so you walk away and try to forget
these other burgers.

43:17.386 --> 43:21.551
But sooner or later curiosity
gets the better of ya.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.591
Curiosity killed the cat.

43:23.643 --> 43:25.600
But you see what I'm getting at.

43:25.645 --> 43:28.308
Burgers are a metaphor for dicks, right?

43:28.356 --> 43:30.393
Something like that, yeah.

43:31.901 --> 43:35.520
- Adele's a vegetarian.
- Then you're screwed.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.733
Your friend Al, is he dangerous?

43:38.908 --> 43:41.116
I mean, is Thomas gonna be okay there?

43:41.160 --> 43:42.822
Al wouldn't hurt a fly.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.280
A gangster that wouldn't hurt a fly?

43:46.332 --> 43:49.700
Seriously, Al never really hurt anybody.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.744
Except for his stepdad that time.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.709
Don't move a fucking muscle.

43:55.883 --> 43:59.217
Oz, long time no see.

43:59.262 --> 44:00.969
Just come out the Scrubs.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.470
Workin' for Fordy, eh?

44:02.515 --> 44:04.051
Time bein'.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.762
Where's the fuckin' money?

44:05.810 --> 44:06.971
Beats me.

44:07.019 --> 44:11.138
Dex left me with the kid and his sister,
took the money and ran.

44:11.190 --> 44:13.056
Don't talk shit.

44:13.109 --> 44:14.850
You two is tight as a duck's ass.

44:14.902 --> 44:17.565
And if I didn't know you better,
I coulda swear you two were queer.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.730
Now, where is he?

44:19.782 --> 44:21.819
What happened to his stepdad?

44:21.868 --> 44:25.452
This guy had been beating and bullying Al
and his mum for years.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.954
One time, Al comes home...

44:27.999 --> 44:31.083
Now, Al loves his mum, loves his mum,

44:31.127 --> 44:33.414
so he decides to try and intervene.

44:33.462 --> 44:36.045
But he can't handle this guy,
he's just a kid right?

44:36.090 --> 44:37.831
So...

44:37.884 --> 44:39.796
Al hit him with a candlestick.

44:39.844 --> 44:40.880
28 times.

44:42.054 --> 44:43.795
28 times?

44:43.848 --> 44:47.558
Look, as long as Thomas
doesn't try to fuck AI's mum,

44:47.602 --> 44:49.093
I think he's gonna be all right.

44:49.145 --> 44:51.933
I'll ask you again, and if I don't start
gettin' the correct answers,

44:51.981 --> 44:54.564
I'm gonna shoot the kid,
starting with his feet.

44:54.609 --> 44:57.317
Okay, hey, it's got nothing to do with me.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.602
I don't give a shit.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.064
I just want the fucking money.
Now, where is it?

45:02.116 --> 45:03.982
I told you, Dex has it.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.242
One...

45:06.621 --> 45:08.533
- Two...
- Come on, Oz.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.665
Ah, fuck.

45:18.883 --> 45:22.092
You always was a loser, Al.
Say goodnight.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.563
- Aw, sh...!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

45:38.611 --> 45:41.479
Ah, jeez, that's it, it's all right.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.158
Fuck, ah, God damn it!

45:50.206 --> 45:51.413
In here?

45:51.457 --> 45:52.573
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.833
Oh, oh fuck, my shoulder.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.286
Okay, easy does it.

46:05.388 --> 46:07.630
What? What's happened?

46:10.059 --> 46:12.722
I need to show you something.
It's in the fridge.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.602
That's a freezer, Al, what is it?

46:14.647 --> 46:16.809
Oh fuck, Jesus!

46:20.778 --> 46:22.360
What the fuck is this?

46:22.405 --> 46:24.738
- It's Oz.
- Yes, I can see it's Oz.

46:24.782 --> 46:27.069
What is he doin' in the freezer, Al?

46:27.118 --> 46:29.075
- Fordy sent him.
- Fuck!

46:29.120 --> 46:31.828
Why's he got sunglasses on?

46:33.082 --> 46:34.744
Cos he was starin' at me.

46:36.377 --> 46:37.868
Right.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.331
Goodbye, Oz.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.672
Are you okay?

46:45.219 --> 46:47.006
It's strange I...

46:47.054 --> 46:49.296
I don't feel any remorse.

46:52.101 --> 46:53.683
Maybe it'll come later.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.389
Do you, do you think they'll hurt us?

47:00.693 --> 47:02.855
No, not intentionally.

47:05.448 --> 47:07.906
I do think we could be in trouble.

47:07.950 --> 47:11.534
Whoever's after those guys
doesn't care who stands in their way.

47:13.622 --> 47:17.332
Well, it's not like we were
staying here long anyway.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.928
Max says he's gonna sort us out,

47:29.972 --> 47:32.885
get us on a flight to the Canaries.

47:38.272 --> 47:40.389
Goes from an airfield not far from here.

47:43.778 --> 47:45.360
When?

47:45.404 --> 47:46.736
First thing tomorrow.

47:49.158 --> 47:50.399
Hey.

47:51.535 --> 47:53.197
How's your arm?

47:53.245 --> 47:54.827
I'll hold.

47:54.872 --> 47:56.829
That bastard hit me.

47:59.377 --> 48:01.243
Well, you did kill him, to be fair.

48:05.174 --> 48:07.382
What are we gonna do about those two?

48:10.805 --> 48:12.592
Slight change of plan.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.347
Here's what's gonna happen.

48:17.186 --> 48:19.803
We're gonna get rid of that body
and then we're gonna go.

48:19.855 --> 48:22.222
Anybody comes through here
looking for us,

48:22.274 --> 48:25.767
Fordy, the guy who's been chasin'
us, the cops, anyone,

48:25.820 --> 48:28.278
you never saw us, you never heard of us,

48:28.322 --> 48:30.359
you never met us, understood?

48:32.076 --> 48:34.443
Okay, now do me a favour,
go get me a torch.

48:35.621 --> 48:36.611
Please.

48:43.212 --> 48:46.330
We're not cleaning that mess up
in the next room either.

48:49.176 --> 48:50.462
We'll do it.

48:51.971 --> 48:52.961
Thanks.

49:29.175 --> 49:32.168
Get up.

49:32.219 --> 49:34.506
Let's get the fuck out of here,
come on, let's go.

49:52.531 --> 49:54.238
- Martine.
- Women!

50:11.217 --> 50:12.799
Oh shit!

50:17.973 --> 50:19.054
No, wait.

50:58.847 --> 51:02.511
This Fordy guy, how dangerous is he?

51:02.560 --> 51:05.052
He's pretty fuckin' dangerous.

51:05.104 --> 51:07.187
How long's it been just you and Thomas?

51:10.693 --> 51:12.434
About a year since they died.

51:14.822 --> 51:16.563
Did they pass at the same time?

51:16.615 --> 51:19.028
Drink driver, just like that.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.363
Fuck, I am sorry.

51:22.830 --> 51:25.288
My dad was in loads of debt.

51:26.500 --> 51:30.460
Deep, deep debt, and we knew
nothing about it, so...

51:58.616 --> 51:59.857
Hey!

52:01.285 --> 52:03.493
Are you... Are you off now?

52:03.537 --> 52:06.496
Gotta get back before
the old man gets home.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.247
Long-distance truck driver.

52:09.877 --> 52:12.244
Must run, bye!

52:12.296 --> 52:13.787
Bye.

52:18.093 --> 52:19.254
Here he is.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.260
Julie gone, I see.

52:22.348 --> 52:24.886
She had us up all night, didn't she?
Dirty little cow!

52:24.933 --> 52:27.175
Yeah, I... I heard.

52:27.227 --> 52:28.684
It was good, wasn't it?

52:30.731 --> 52:32.097
Coffee?

52:32.149 --> 52:34.357
Yes, stick it over there for a minute.

52:34.401 --> 52:35.892
Okay.

52:37.404 --> 52:38.815
All right.

52:40.866 --> 52:42.607
Where the fuck are you going?

52:42.660 --> 52:45.027
You know, I'm gettin' ready to go to work.

52:45.079 --> 52:47.696
You're not fucking going to work.
Let me buy you a decent breakfast.

52:47.748 --> 52:50.456
I can't, Lewis, I'm gonna get fired.

52:51.752 --> 52:53.493
Timmy?

52:53.545 --> 52:54.581
Timmy, Timmy!

52:55.673 --> 52:57.289
Come on, my treat.

52:57.341 --> 52:58.673
Just stay there, good.

52:58.717 --> 53:00.879
I need five more minutes.

53:04.223 --> 53:06.340
- Okay.
- Good lad.

53:46.014 --> 53:48.848
So you have a problem with breastfeeding?

53:48.892 --> 53:52.385
No, I have a problem with breastfeeding
in a public place.

53:52.396 --> 53:54.888
- What's the difference?
- There's a massive difference.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.647
Okay, enlighten me.

53:56.692 --> 53:59.776
Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem
with any woman gettin' her tits out.

53:59.820 --> 54:01.027
Well, most women.

54:01.071 --> 54:04.405
But if the puppies are coming out
to feed a baby,

54:04.450 --> 54:06.237
that's a different story.

54:06.285 --> 54:08.151
Breastfeeding a baby, it's... it's...

54:08.203 --> 54:12.868
It's the most beautiful and the most
wonderful thing in the world, it's...

54:12.916 --> 54:15.329
Well, so is taking a shit, but I think
a few people might object

54:15.377 --> 54:17.039
if I decided to drop the kids off
at the pool

54:17.087 --> 54:18.828
in the middle of the diner,
don't you think?

54:18.881 --> 54:20.463
Yeah.

54:20.507 --> 54:24.296
However, if a woman started
breastfeeding in here,

54:24.344 --> 54:26.301
I doubt anyone would have the balls to say
to her,

54:26.346 --> 54:28.838
"Excuse me love, but would you not do that
while I'm eating?"

54:28.891 --> 54:30.348
So what you're saying is...

54:31.560 --> 54:35.270
What you're saying is that you don't mind
a woman getting her tits out

54:35.314 --> 54:36.896
just whenever and wherever,

54:36.940 --> 54:39.353
but you do mind if she does it
to feed her child.

54:39.401 --> 54:41.108
Pretty much.

54:41.153 --> 54:43.486
All right, well I wouldn't
look behind you then.

54:48.702 --> 54:52.742
Two English breakfasts.
You must be hungry.

54:52.790 --> 54:55.578
Well, a man's gotta keep his strength up.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.471
Um, you didn't tell me what you did.

55:10.516 --> 55:14.726
Well, it's the age-old clichÃ©.
If I tell you, I'll have to kill you.

55:14.770 --> 55:17.558
I'm more interested in your boss, anyway.
What was his name again?

55:17.606 --> 55:19.393
- Derrick?
- Yeah, why?

55:19.441 --> 55:23.776
Well, it seems to me...
like he needs to be taught a lesson.

55:23.821 --> 55:26.859
Hm, wouldn't mind teachin' him a lesson.

55:26.907 --> 55:28.648
Wouldn't mind killin' him sometimes.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.737
That's a good idea.

55:30.786 --> 55:32.197
What do you mean?

55:32.246 --> 55:34.033
Well, you know where he lives, don't you?

55:35.249 --> 55:36.956
Tim, I'll be waitin' for him.

55:39.962 --> 55:41.578
You're not serious.

55:41.630 --> 55:43.292
Hell yes.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.047
Well, we're...

55:45.092 --> 55:47.334
We're not gonna do anything
to my boss, all right?

55:47.386 --> 55:50.049
Tim, you asked what I did for a living.
This is what I do.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.423
What do you mean this is what you do?

55:55.519 --> 55:57.135
You kill people?

55:58.480 --> 56:02.599
Like a... a hit man?

56:02.651 --> 56:05.189
Guy's a fucking arsehole.

56:05.237 --> 56:09.732
I know he is, but people are nasty
to other people all the time.

56:09.783 --> 56:11.945
You don't, you can't just go
and kill them.

56:11.994 --> 56:15.487
Even his girlfriend tells him to do one.
Nobody is gonna miss him.

56:15.539 --> 56:18.498
I'm sorry, can you excuse me a second?
I'm just gonna...

56:18.542 --> 56:20.875
- Er, where you goin'?
- Just to the men's room.

56:20.919 --> 56:22.581
Well, you won't be needin' those, will ya?

56:51.742 --> 56:53.324
You all right?

56:54.745 --> 56:55.952
Yeah, I'm fine.

56:57.372 --> 57:00.080
You sure? Bloke almost killed you.

57:01.543 --> 57:02.829
I'm fine.

57:05.714 --> 57:07.455
Get you a coffee or summat?

57:14.348 --> 57:15.429
So what's your name?

57:16.850 --> 57:18.136
What's yours?

57:18.185 --> 57:19.676
Sean.

57:22.522 --> 57:24.479
You have Lee tattooed on your arm.

57:28.820 --> 57:29.810
That's right.

57:32.991 --> 57:34.527
Is Lee your partner or something?

57:35.619 --> 57:36.826
Do I look gay?

57:38.664 --> 57:40.121
No.

57:40.165 --> 57:42.657
You just never know these days.

57:42.709 --> 57:44.951
Lee was my twin brother.

57:45.003 --> 57:46.210
Was?

57:48.507 --> 57:50.464
He died at birth.

57:53.387 --> 57:54.468
Oh.

57:55.514 --> 57:56.675
I'm sorry.

57:56.723 --> 57:57.804
Me too.

57:59.559 --> 58:01.721
It's not like I knew him
or anything though, is it?

58:01.770 --> 58:03.511
Well, still sad though.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.724
So what about you?

58:07.776 --> 58:09.062
What about me?

58:09.111 --> 58:11.148
Do you have a sad story to tell?

58:14.700 --> 58:16.407
I guess you could call it that.

58:19.746 --> 58:20.736
Well?

58:24.751 --> 58:25.992
It's a long story.

58:28.422 --> 58:29.583
I've got time.

58:33.093 --> 58:35.005
Do you want breakfast?

58:35.053 --> 58:36.385
Why?

58:36.430 --> 58:37.671
Because you might be hungry.

58:38.932 --> 58:40.548
You're not making this very easy, are you?

58:41.935 --> 58:43.016
Yeah.

59:02.789 --> 59:04.530
What do you want, Elliott?

59:04.583 --> 59:05.915
How's your new job?

59:05.959 --> 59:07.450
Fine, thanks.

59:07.502 --> 59:09.664
You've just started with
the police, right?

59:09.713 --> 59:10.920
Yeah.

59:10.964 --> 59:15.755
And they'd be able to find the last known
addresses of a vehicle's owner, right?

59:15.802 --> 59:17.885
Yeah, where's this going?

59:17.929 --> 59:19.545
I need to find the address,

59:19.598 --> 59:21.760
the last known address of a person.

59:21.808 --> 59:23.424
Yeah, I can't do that.

59:23.477 --> 59:25.764
You know I wouldn't ask
unless it was important.

59:25.812 --> 59:26.893
Please?

59:28.857 --> 59:30.644
This better be life or death.

59:35.906 --> 59:38.364
I've been locked up most of my life.

59:38.408 --> 59:40.240
What'd you do in there?

59:40.285 --> 59:43.323
Computers, creative writin'.

59:43.371 --> 59:45.237
What'd you write about?

59:45.290 --> 59:47.282
They asked us to write about our day.

59:47.334 --> 59:48.575
Can you imagine?

59:48.627 --> 59:50.243
Locked up for 23 hours of it,

59:50.295 --> 59:53.254
doesn't exactly make for
very interesting reading.

59:55.300 --> 59:56.791
So you never had a proper job?

59:56.843 --> 59:58.675
I've tried courses.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.757
Bricklayin', woodwork.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:03.014
Only problem is you put a load of thieves
and druggies

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:05.971
in a room with expensive tools and
things have a habit of goin' missin'.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:09.186
Not that you'd know about that.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.352
Where are we going?

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:14.938
Let's have some fun.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:32.334
Susie, Susie, thank God.
It's, it's Tim.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:33.415
<i>Is Derrick there?</i>

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:34.954
No, he's not in at the moment,

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:38.670
but he did leave a message for you
saying he wants the company car back.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:40.755
What, what's wrong?

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.888
Well, you can't keep the car
if you don't work for the company.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:47.016
What, so... So he, he's firing me?!

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.801
You called this morning and quit, Tim,

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:51.141
and rather rudely too,
if you don't mind me saying.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:54.682
Susie, I haven't phoned anybody today.

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:57.943
Well, it was your phone and
it sounded very much like you.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:02.948
Oh, my God.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.154
Goodbye, Tim.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:07.946
Oh, my God, Susie, um,
I got, I'll talk to you later.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.338
He asked me into the toilet.

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:23.629
Said he... wanted me
to help him with something.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.264
And he hit me, head-butted me.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:33.521
He held a knife to my throat.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:38.769
I pleaded with him, I said,
"Please, don't kill me."

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:44.149
That was the last thing
I remember before, um...

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:45.783
I was knocked out.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:54.542
I woke up and my wallet, my phone,

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:57.579
my wedding ring, my car, all gone.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.626
I feel so stupid.

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:07.175
Okay.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:12.510
And you're positive that this is the man
that attacked you?

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:15.475
Oh yeah, no mistaking, that's him.

01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:18.641
We're gonna need your car registration
and your bank details.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:22.812
- Have you cancelled your cards yet?
- No, no, not yet.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.321
Good.

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:30.653
Do you believe why he was in the toilet?

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:32.822
No more than I believe
in Father Christmas.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:34.911
Run the cards and see
if he's used them anywhere.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.576
- Sir.
- What?

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:37.960
Ma'am.

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:42.624
- We've got a sighting of Hunting.
- Where?

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.508
At a diner on the A666.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.214
Press time.

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:26.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.092
- You okay?
- Fine.

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:33.049
- Did you get the information?
- Yeah.

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:37.141
Look, shouldn't you be out
playing football or chasing girls?

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:41.023
I've never even watched a football match
on TV, let alone played one.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.768
And all the best girls are taken.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.988
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:53.323
Look, I could get fired for this.

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:56.789
So, who is it that you think is
the serial killer?

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.369
The local gardener.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.330
It's a bit of an obvious choice though.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:01.960
What I want you to do

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:05.544
is to read out the locations the truck was
registered at, okay?

01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:09.255
Fire away.

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.387
August 2007, Birmingham.

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:13.798
Hang on, bingo, the Solihull Strangler.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.842
Solihull, just outside Birmingham.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:18.011
Three women murdered by strangulation.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.434
Yeah, the name kind gave away
the method, Elliott.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.644
Next.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.729
Brighton, 2009.

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:30.030
Got two murders in Hove
that year, February, two kids.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.816
What month do you have?

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.530
February.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.445
Next?

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:39.662
Swansea, 2009 to 2012.

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:45.622
Six men all disappeared overnight
in a three-year period,

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:48.791
and they were found dead
in a local marina.

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:50.334
Coincidence?

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.971
Look, just because some crackpot website
has linked these deaths to serial killers

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.096
doesn't give you any proof

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.508
that this gardener is the serial killer
from around here.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.553
We got three separate serial killers
around the country,

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:03.643
and a man linked to those areas
at the time of the murders.

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:05.307
Now, we have a serial killer in our town

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.603
who started just around the same time
the gardener turned up.

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:10.738
I don't know, Elliott.

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:13.024
If you're so convinced,
why don't you talk to your uncle?

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.066
I already did.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:17.452
I've gotta get back.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:19.989
If it turns out that it is the gardener...

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:21.907
and he kills again and we did nothing,

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.826
how you gonna feel then?

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:29.923
Look...

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:32.130
I'm not your babysitter any more.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.886
Just try and stay outta trouble, okay?

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.672
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:17.304
Get out, get out!

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:22.684
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.516
Al, Al.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.566
Dex.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.347
Okay, give me that.

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:11.184
I'm so... sorry I got you two
involved in all this shit.

01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:13.398
I'm sorry about Al.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.614
There's a main road over there...

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:17.990
on the other side of that field.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:21.027
Get to it, hitch a ride.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:23.407
Here's a big bag of money.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.913
That'll sort you out.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:29.413
What are you gonna do?

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.749
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:39.086
Thank you.

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:40.595
Look after each other.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:06.864
You fucker!

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.825
Fuck!

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.144
Don't move!

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:20.854
Fordy, it's your time to die.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.611
It's your time.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.121
Look at me, you look at me.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.791
Sh, sh.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:39.415
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.174
It's just your time.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.687
This is where they usually leave.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.230
- Who?
- Guys.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:06.070
- What guys?
- Guys that I've been on a date with.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:08.907
What's the deal with all these questions?

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.947
I mean, who wants to go out with
a prostitute?

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.206
Are you telling me
because you want me to leave?

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:16.494
No, I'm telling you because I want to be
honest with you.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.037
Because I don't wanna leave.

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:21.457
Though I might, if you don't cheer up.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:29.090
I know I've been a bitch,
but this is important.

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:31.850
I must have parked down here somewhere.

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:47.246
So.

01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:52.759
Here we are.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.107
Let's run a bath.

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:22.747
Yeah.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.749
Simpson's card has just been used
to book a hotel room.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.036
I'll be right there.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.899
Tim, welcome to the party!

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:55.356
What did you do?

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:56.524
What do you mean?

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.032
Well, he just needed
a little bit of a drink.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.867
Tim!

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:05.328
Tim, I didn't do anything!

01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:08.414
Come back here, you horrible little man!

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:03.215
Hope I'm not too late to join the party.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:04.929
Where's Al?

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.513
He didn't make it.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.187
And Fordy?

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.814
Yeah, he didn't make it either.

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:13.691
Oh well!

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:15.477
One less thing to worry about.

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.192
Money safe?

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.530
Good.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.872
- Let's get you on the plane then.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:31.035
Hands out, slowly, slowly.

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:37.624
I'm not a fuckin' idiot, Max.
I know you set me up.

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:39.212
The only thing I don't understand

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.129
is why you didn't kill me
when you had the chance.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.889
I don't shit on my own doorstep.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.722
Nothing to do with getting your sweaty
hands on that money then?

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:50.515
Nah, I'm givin' that all back.

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:53.147
Less a finder's fee, of course.

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:58.191
You never did stop blamin' me
for Molly's death, did you?

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:00.905
No.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.073
Neither did I.

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:13.702
You do what you gotta do, Max.

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:30.351
I told you not to trust anyone.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:48.839
Fuck you, Dexter.

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.789
Is this what you were thinking of?

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.879
Okay, Hunting, put the fucking weapon
down or this all ends here!

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:04.539
Drop it, Lee! Come on.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:16.101
<i>And so it ends.</i>

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:20.389
<i>The biggest manhunt, or should I say
womanhunt, in Curiosity history</i>

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:24.936
<i>comes to a bloody conclusion here tonight
with the apprehension of Lee Hunting,</i>

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.900
<i>the alleged Christmas Day killer.</i>

01:20:27.948 --> 01:20:32.488
<i>Lee Hunting, whose recent escape
from St Andrew's Mental Institute</i>

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:35.028
<i>that sparked the entire police
investigation</i>

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.992
<i>was apprehended here this evening.</i>

01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:38.282
<i>She is taken off now.</i>

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:42.328
<i>The diminutive figure is led off
by the CID to be questioned</i>

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:48.376
<i>in conjunction with the identification
of an as-yet unnamed male body.</i>

01:20:58.103 --> 01:20:59.514
Well, you got her.

01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:02.180
Yeah.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:06.818
You be okay?

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.189
Yeah, I think I am.

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:14.446
So what now?

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:18.704
Drink.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.545
How did you find me?

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:18.181
You're so pathetic.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:22.264
All right, this is how I would have
done it, I think.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:24.895
Your home number was on your mobile,
the code gave me the area,

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.148
and the phone book, well, that gave me
your address.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.149
And I already had the keys to get in,
didn't I?

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:32.028
What happened to Derrick?

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:34.940
Why do you care?
You don't work for him any more.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:38.531
Yeah, why did you do that?
Why did you quit my job for me?

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:42.198
Because you don't like working for him.
The guy is an arsehole.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:44.286
You can do so much better.

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:46.535
Did you kill him?

01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:48.704
Maybe.

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:55.294
Look, I can't do anything alone, yeah?
I need you to help me.

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:56.426
Why me?

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:57.838
Because, Tim...

01:22:58.932 --> 01:23:01.094
...I am you.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:02.509
You are me.

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:05.891
I don't know what that means.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.805
Come on, think about it.

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:09.941
Think about it. When did I first turn up?

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:14.195
Well, I picked you, I gave you a lift.
This is bullshit!

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:16.572
I do the things you wanna do, Tim.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:21.573
Guess what, you ain't got the balls
to do 'em, have you?

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:24.660
Hey, Bruce Wayne,
he's got Batman, hasn't he?

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:28.167
Peter Parker, he's got Spider-Man,
and you Tim, you, you've got me.

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:31.125
Think!

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:32.789
The guy outside the club.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.458
This is how you deal with pricks, Tim.

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:42.386
The girl at the club.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:46.018
Who's the fuckin' man?

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:48.438
Breakfast at the diner...

01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:50.269
Quittin' your job.

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:51.899
He needs teaching a lesson.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:54.652
In fact, I wouldn't mind
killin' him sometimes.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.233
That's not a bad idea.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:59.399
Dealing with Derrick.

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.740
What the fuck are you doing here?
I told you to get your fuck...

01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:07.828
What have you done, Tim?

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.742
What have you fucking done?

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:14.748
Agh, no, agh!

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:19.002
No! No, no, no!

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:51.496
Okay, Nigel.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:15.733
It took me a while to nail you,

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.439
but I got you in the end.

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:19.855
Go, Frank!

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:28.613
Right.

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:32.916
Where shall I begin, hm?

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:40.917
Just a little anaesthetic.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:22.543
So, where did all this begin?

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:30.051
Back in the day, I used to work
for various gangs

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:32.014
or firms, as we like to call them.

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:39.442
Information extraction,
torture, interrogation.

01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:45.774
I could get blood out of a stone, me.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.905
Psycho Stubbs, I was known as.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:54.157
But like all good things,
they had to come to an end.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:56.326
I was sent down.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:57.914
I got ten years.

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:07.128
While I was away,
they sent in people like you.

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:11.599
Child murderers, shit like that.

01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:14.803
They got their own cell.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.722
Special dispensation.

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.142
Change of identity when they let 'em out.

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:24.566
While the rest of us where slumming it.

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:34.865
And then one day, close to my parole...

01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:38.667
...I gets a little message in my ear.

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:45.300
"Track 'em down and make 'em disappear."

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:50.429
So I look at the headlines
in the newspapers for a clue.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:54.433
Searched the internet.

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.470
See where I had to go.

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:07.563
How did I find you?

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:13.323
I only had to shake your hand.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.372
That was enough for me.

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:22.791
Don't worry.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:26.799
I'll make you disappear
before the police find you.

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:29.506
I think it's simpler that way,
don't you think?

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:39.057
It's not nice...

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:44.191
having people do things to you
that you don't want them to do.

01:28:44.236 --> 01:28:45.898
Is it?

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:50.322
But you should've thought about that

01:28:50.367 --> 01:28:54.407
before you started killing
all those lovely ladies.

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:21.144
Come on.

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.022
There, you hungry, fella?

01:29:24.067 --> 01:29:25.603
You hungry, eh?

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:27.063
Hey.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.698
Looks like we're in for a long night,
Frank.

01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:50.197
- No!
- Hello, Timothy.

01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:52.537
No, no, no, no!

01:33:52.585 --> 01:33:53.917
No!
