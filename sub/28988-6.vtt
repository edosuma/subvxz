WEBVTT

00:09.270 --> 00:11.402
- You really sold your soul.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.056
- I believe in a lot
of the same things you do.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.666
I'm just a lot smarter
about trying to get them done.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.233
- It looks like I'm standing
in the same place you are

00:16.277 --> 00:17.756
by staying true to myself.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.757
- Well, the next time you want
to be true to yourself,

00:18.801 --> 00:20.324
don't take me down with you.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.065
- Can they just throw us out
like this?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.675
It was supposed to be 90 days.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.808
Act of God.
- This wasn't God.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.375
- I want to see progress
on North Park this week,

00:27.418 --> 00:28.376
or I'm out.

00:28.419 --> 00:29.377
- You were right.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.813
I am seeing someone.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.467
I'm in a relationship.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.077
- Stephanie Novak has MS.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.470
I had to tell her.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.688
She can't work five feet
from you

00:36.732 --> 00:38.255
and not know what's going on.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.735
- My ex-husband had ALS.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.824
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.087
- Maybe it's because I'm here.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.871
- Keep your distance from her
for a while.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.091
Wake up! You're not
keeping an eye on her.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.180
She's keeping an eye on you.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.790
- A man died.
It was my fault.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.531
- Imagine
I'm this man's father.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.185
What would you say to me?

00:55.229 --> 00:56.708
- I'd say Tommy Diehl
didn't deserve to die.

01:05.587 --> 01:06.892
- Don't bother looking in there

01:06.936 --> 01:08.764
unless you want
leftover Chinese

01:08.807 --> 01:10.200
and, uh--oh,
half a grapefruit.

01:12.594 --> 01:13.856
- There's an open bottle
of white.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.466
- Oh, yes, please.

01:17.294 --> 01:20.558
- You know, after all
that room service,

01:20.602 --> 01:23.561
I was kind of looking forward
to a home-cooked meal.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.346
- Start looking forward
to takeout.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.480
- Hey, whatever happened
to the Jessica Pearson

01:29.524 --> 01:31.221
who used to cook me
beef bourguignon?

01:31.265 --> 01:32.744
- Did I do that?

01:32.788 --> 01:36.226
- Yes, you did.
- Oh, yeah.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.749
I was wooing you.

01:37.793 --> 01:41.144
- Oh, you were wooing me, huh?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.233
Welcome home.

01:43.277 --> 01:44.669
Do you have to leave
right away?

01:44.713 --> 01:46.541
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.

01:46.584 --> 01:49.892
I'm hoping to stay a day
or two, but, uh, we'll see.

01:49.935 --> 01:53.200
- Is everything all right?
Is it the trial?

01:53.243 --> 01:54.766
- Was that him back there?

01:54.810 --> 01:56.420
Nick D'Amato.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.726
- Oh.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.598
- I mean, you two
seemed pretty familiar.

02:00.642 --> 02:04.776
- I was talking to him
about Quentin's illness

02:04.820 --> 02:06.865
and I got choked up.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.259
- Quentin's illness?
- Yeah.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.609
- J, you barely open up
to me about that.

02:11.653 --> 02:15.265
- The mayor's wife has MS.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.485
I just found out about it.
That's why it came up.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.182
- I'm going straight to hell,
aren't I?

02:19.226 --> 02:21.445
Oh, I appreciate the jealousy.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.186
- Oh?

02:23.230 --> 02:25.449
You're gonna turn this
into a good thing?

02:25.493 --> 02:27.843
- When I only have you
for a day or two?

02:30.367 --> 02:32.717
Yeah, damn right I am.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.994
- Come on, boys.
You're gonna be late.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.214
And I know Sister Mary
doesn't want you to be late.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.694
- Oh, my gosh.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.306
Okay, what's for lunch?
- Peanut butter and jelly!

02:56.350 --> 02:59.222
- How'd you know?
Yes, peanut butter and jelly.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.268
- He knows because
we have it every day.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.704
- Yeah!

03:02.747 --> 03:04.271
- ♪ Peanut butter jelly time

03:04.314 --> 03:05.837
all:
♪ Peanut butter jelly time

03:05.881 --> 03:07.578
♪ Peanut butter jelly,
peanut butter jelly ♪

03:07.622 --> 03:09.232
♪ Peanut butter jelly

03:09.276 --> 03:10.842
- ♪ Where you at?
Where you at? ♪

03:10.886 --> 03:13.367
- ♪ Now there you go,

03:13.410 --> 03:14.933
How do you know
the Buckwheat Boyz?

03:14.977 --> 03:17.980
- The who?
- From Mario Kart!

03:18.023 --> 03:19.895
- Who?
- From Mario Kart.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.026
- I don't know what that is.
Let's go.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.941
Hey, slow down, babe.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.295
- Mom, look! A transformer.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.688
Can we go closer?
- No, baby.

03:30.732 --> 03:31.863
We got to get
to that bus stop,

03:31.907 --> 03:33.517
or you're gonna be late.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.563
- All right.

03:35.606 --> 03:37.913
- Come on, baby.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.655
- Whee!
- Let's go.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.876
- Hi, you've reached
the cell phone of Keri Allen.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.878
Please leave the date
and time of your call

03:46.922 --> 03:48.532
and don't forget
your phone number.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.709
- Hey.
- What's up?

03:51.753 --> 03:53.537
- I didn't know you were here.
I thought you left.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.322
- I'm here.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.280
- I was hoping maybe you could
help me with my shot.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.500
- Yeah, of course.
You still nervous?

03:59.543 --> 04:02.285
- Oh, I just hate
looking at it.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.030
- Thanks.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.473
Sexy.

04:16.517 --> 04:17.953
- Stop it.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.521
Ready?

04:28.050 --> 04:30.444
I wish I could go to the
conference with you next week.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.402
- Wait, you're not going?

04:32.446 --> 04:33.751
Steph.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.927
- You will be fine.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.408
- You're my biggest asset.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.757
How am I supposed to talk
to Garcetti

04:39.801 --> 04:41.411
about a homeless initiative
without you there?

04:43.152 --> 04:44.675
- You're smarter than I am.

04:44.719 --> 04:47.939
- Oh, yeah, well,
you're smart enough.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.941
- Isn't that what Obama said
about Hillary?

04:51.639 --> 04:52.901
He said,
"You're likable enough."

04:52.944 --> 04:54.468
- What?

04:54.511 --> 04:56.600
- He said she was
likable enough.

04:56.644 --> 04:57.601
- Right.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.648
Well, he got past it.

05:00.691 --> 05:03.825
- Yeah. He did.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.891
- Shit.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.676
Jessica, hi! I'm on my way.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.634
Um, I can be there
in less than, um--

05:30.678 --> 05:32.070
- Yoli, relax.
- No, no, no.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.638
I can Uber if you need me
to, um, book it.

05:34.682 --> 05:35.944
- No, don't book it.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.772
I'm taking the morning off.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.251
- Oh, okay.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.123
Is everything okay?

05:41.166 --> 05:44.082
- Uh, yeah. That's, uh--that's
what I was gonna ask you.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.606
- No, ev--everything's fine.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.521
I-I will need
that updated list

05:47.564 --> 05:49.087
of possible aldermans
we talked about.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.088
Would you stop that?

05:50.132 --> 05:51.568
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.178
That's the first thing
I'm gonna do.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.571
And, um, what should I tell
the mayor if he asks?

05:54.615 --> 05:55.703
'Cause you know he's gonna ask.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.836
- Tell him I'm out of pocket.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.665
- Out of pocket.
Listen to you with the jargon.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.667
-  Yoli.
- Uh, yeah?

06:03.711 --> 06:06.583
- I'm hanging up now.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.630
- Okay. Um, have--have fun.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.022
Uh, I've got to go.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.111
Um...
- Oh.

06:13.155 --> 06:15.462
You know how much I love you,
bebita.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.638
- Sí,Mami.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.031
Okay, Mami, I got to go.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.859
- I'm so proud of you.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.906
- Ma, I know. I know.
You tell me every day.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.255
Okay? I got to go.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.083
- Okay.
- Bye, Papi.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.954
- Adios, mi cielo.
- Te amo.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.608
- Te amo.
- Okay.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.219
Thanks, Ma.

06:34.263 --> 06:37.048
Okay, bye!

06:45.143 --> 06:47.058
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

06:47.102 --> 06:48.886
- Uh, I'm Angela.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.628
Jessica's cousin.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.021
- Right.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.805
Is she expecting you?

06:54.849 --> 06:57.808
- Uh, actually, I was just
in the neighborhood and...

06:57.852 --> 07:00.071
- Angela. Hi.
- Hey.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.986
Sorry just to drop by
like this.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.641
- Uh, no, no. I'm glad you did.
Come on in.

07:04.685 --> 07:05.990
Did you meet Jeff?

07:06.034 --> 07:07.775
- We just met.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.211
- Is something wrong?

07:09.254 --> 07:11.343
- Um, actually,
I'm not too sure.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.910
When I left with the boys
this morning,

07:12.954 --> 07:15.173
there was one of those
demolition cranes outside.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.175
- They're not supposed to start
work for another two months.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.003
- Yeah, sometimes these
shady-ass developers

07:19.047 --> 07:21.789
start tearing buildings down
before everyone's even out.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.268
- Let me look into it.
- Thanks.

07:23.312 --> 07:24.574
And you know I wouldn't
barge in like this.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.054
It's just, Mark has some asthma

07:26.097 --> 07:27.229
and I don't want him inhaling
all that dust

07:27.272 --> 07:28.622
if they're gonna start up.

07:28.665 --> 07:29.623
- I'll look into it
first thing.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.711
- Thanks.
- Yes.

07:31.929 --> 07:34.628
- Ooh, yes.
Uh, nice meeting you.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.368
- Yeah.

07:36.412 --> 07:38.762
- Good for you.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.198
Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

07:42.287 --> 07:44.768
- 4-8-7. No, it's an A.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.204
Okay, all right. Bye.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.643
I'm a little busy.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.383
- You don't have 60 seconds?
- Uh, no.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.037
Between the lease
for Lincoln Yards

07:53.081 --> 07:54.604
and the massive
corporate welfare

07:54.648 --> 07:55.866
that you promised Ickaris,

07:55.910 --> 07:57.564
which the city can't afford,
not really.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.870
- I'm sorry.
- About the tax break?

07:59.914 --> 08:02.177
- For snapping at you
when you asked about Steph.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.744
You were being kind.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.659
I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.399
- Wow, I haven't seen
a mea culpa like that

08:07.443 --> 08:09.053
since you pretended to care
about the parking meter mess.

08:09.097 --> 08:11.360
- I mean it, Keri.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.753
I'm trying.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.711
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

08:14.755 --> 08:16.234
- Why? Uh, I'm fine.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.932
I mean, if it bothers you
that I bring her up,

08:17.975 --> 08:19.716
it makes you feel guilty,
then I won't bring her up.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.413
- My guilt's over you.
- Me?

08:21.457 --> 08:23.807
- I don't want you sitting
around with this on your mind.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.244
I don't want you putting
your life on hold.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.639
- I'm not putting my life
on hold.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.775
- Are you talking about men?

08:36.820 --> 08:39.606
- Do you really want to have
this conversation right now?

08:50.051 --> 08:51.922
- Have my coffee?

08:51.966 --> 08:53.402
- So much for being
out of pocket.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.012
- Sorry to get
your hopes up.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.362
- I work in City Hall.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.799
I'm used to people
flip-flopping.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.150
- Were you able
to find anything?

09:02.193 --> 09:03.281
- After getting
the total runaround

09:03.325 --> 09:04.761
from that witch in Buildings,

09:04.805 --> 09:06.110
I remembered my friend Isaiah
from CHA

09:06.154 --> 09:07.938
had access to everything
you needed.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.114
And it looks like that
rico como mierda

09:10.158 --> 09:12.464
got an emergency permit
to start phased demolition.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.423
He also got a waiver
for the asbestos abatement.

09:14.466 --> 09:15.859
- In other words?

09:15.903 --> 09:16.991
- Well, he starts on Monday.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.122
He doesn't care who he poisons.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.254
- Son of a bitch.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.082
- If you don't mind me asking,

09:21.125 --> 09:23.171
why is North Park
so important to you?

09:23.214 --> 09:25.739
I thought the mayor was
supporting redevelopment there.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.131
I'm sorry.

09:27.175 --> 09:30.961
- No. I have relatives
who live there...

09:31.005 --> 09:33.181
who soon won't have
a place to live.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.922
- On the South Side?
- Mm-hmm.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.011
- Wait, I don't understand.
I thought you were, like--

09:37.054 --> 09:39.187
- La rica como mierda?

09:39.230 --> 09:41.145
- No, no, no. No.
That's not what I wanted to--

09:41.189 --> 09:42.669
that's not what
I was gonna say.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.714
- You didn't have to.
And I am.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.066
But it, uh...

09:49.110 --> 09:51.155
it seems they'd rather
live on the street

09:51.199 --> 09:53.201
than to accept my help.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.377
- Mm, I get it.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.161
My parents are proud like that.

09:57.205 --> 10:00.034
- Well, your parents aren't
about to lose their home.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.340
- Excuse me.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.828
- Did you get Sean's present?
- I love it.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.264
It's right here on the desk.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.875
Hey, you see that, buddy?

10:18.008 --> 10:20.837
Uh, Grandpa's got to make
a real building now.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.186
- All right, we miss you, Dad.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.318
- Yeah, I miss you too,
baby girl.

10:23.361 --> 10:24.493
Got to go.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.191
- Tell me, Pat.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.019
Exactly how much did you slip
that woman in Buildings

10:29.063 --> 10:30.325
to make this happen?

10:30.368 --> 10:31.848
- There's gambling
in Casablanca?

10:31.892 --> 10:33.284
I'm shocked.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.373
- Don't get cute with me.
We had a goddamn deal.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.158
You promised my family 90 days.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.463
- And I was gonna
honor that deal,

10:38.507 --> 10:40.030
but I didn't have a choice.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.553
- You know, based
on that phone call,

10:41.597 --> 10:44.469
there's a human being
in there somewhere.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.036
So what happened?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.037
That little devil
on your shoulder

10:47.081 --> 10:48.386
tell you not to do it?

10:48.430 --> 10:50.214
- No, Albert Chan
told me not to.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.563
- Who the hell is Albert Chan?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.043
- He's a 30-year-old
billionaire

10:53.087 --> 10:55.045
who's buying up
half of Chicago.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.568
Get used to hearing his name.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.092
- He called in his loan,
didn't he?

10:58.135 --> 10:59.746
- It's business, Jessica.

10:59.789 --> 11:00.964
- No, if it was business,

11:01.008 --> 11:02.531
you'd get the money
somewhere else.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.576
- Banks have all tightened
their belts since '06.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.187
- Yeah, for regular people.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.884
But rich people
can always get more money.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.364
It's why they're rich.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.974
- Look, we can go around
and round on this,

11:11.018 --> 11:12.236
but it's not gonna make
a difference.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.238
I had no choice.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.762
- I'll tell that
to my cousin and her boys

11:15.805 --> 11:17.372
who are about to breathe in
all that asbestos.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.113
- Look, don't make me out
to be the monster here.

11:19.156 --> 11:21.115
Chan is.

11:21.158 --> 11:24.379
With or without him,
this day was gonna come anyway.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.120
It's time to move on.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.557
- I couldn't agree more.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.570
- If you're here about
the alderman vacancy,

11:41.613 --> 11:43.093
I'll have a list for you
in a week or two.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.399
- Well, I'm glad to hear

11:44.442 --> 11:46.314
you're not relying on me
for everything.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.577
- I did get here without you,
if you didn't know.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.579
- I'd like to help
keep you here.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.931
- What's on your mind,
Ms. Pearson?

11:54.975 --> 11:57.281
- You need to find an
alternative source of financing

11:57.325 --> 11:58.543
for your reelection.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.328
- There is
no alternative source.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.895
You of all people know that.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.200
- Well, if that's the case,

12:03.244 --> 12:04.593
then you're in a world
of trouble.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.856
'Cause your sugar daddy
is tapped out.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.380
- What the hell
are you talking about?

12:09.424 --> 12:11.861
- McGann's not just deep
in the hole on North Park

12:11.905 --> 12:14.472
but on half a dozen
other projects around town.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.300
None of the banks here
will loan to him.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.302
He's had to go overseas.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.348
- Pat doesn't borrow
from out of the country.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.958
- He's not just borrowing.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.482
He's begging, fetching,
and rolling over.

12:24.526 --> 12:25.962
- Jesus Christ.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.268
- Now, the way I see it,

12:27.311 --> 12:29.052
what's bad for McGann
is good for you.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.488
- How do you figure that?

12:30.532 --> 12:32.316
- This is your chance
to hit the reset button.

12:32.360 --> 12:36.059
If you secure campaign
financing from other sources,

12:36.103 --> 12:38.061
you can finally
buy your freedom.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.368
- It's not that simple.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.152
I wouldn't be here without him.

12:42.196 --> 12:45.373
- What's the point of being
here if he controls you?

12:45.416 --> 12:47.984
I see how it eats away
at you every day.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.378
It's time to be
your own man.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.555
Take away his money
and you take away his power.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.471
Unless, of course,
this is about something else.

12:56.514 --> 12:59.517
Is there something else,
Mr. Mayor?

13:05.741 --> 13:07.874
- I put the donors in groups

13:07.917 --> 13:09.701
based on which issues
are most important to them.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.791
- This list is as long
as my arm, Derrick.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.010
- I'll shorten it up for you.
Allan Steiner.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.751
He's your whale.
You want to target him first.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.970
- Tell me why.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.798
- He's a rich,
liberal pied piper.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.495
Kind of a godfather of ideas
to the others.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.844
Get him,
and the rest will follow.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.846
- One-stop shop. I like it.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.413
- I'll get you a list
of his pet projects

13:25.456 --> 13:26.849
and special interests
before you meet with him.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.024
- Make sure it's shorter
than that one, please.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.721
- Damn.
You try to be thorough.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.114
- Hmm.
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

13:31.158 --> 13:32.986
but Angela Cook
has left three messages.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.075
- Thank you.
- Um, also, should I make

13:35.118 --> 13:36.859
a lunch reservation
for you today?

13:36.903 --> 13:38.687
- Yes, make it
a reservation for two.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.994
Any suggestions where
I should take Mr. Steiner?

13:41.037 --> 13:43.648
- Well, he lives off Lake Shore
and Burton. Try Gibson's.

13:43.692 --> 13:46.434
I don't need to get the phone
number for you, do I?

13:46.477 --> 13:48.828
- No, you don't.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.960
Is 2:30 okay?
- Perfect.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.882
I'm not having any of that.
- Any of what?

13:59.926 --> 14:01.449
- Don't give me that bullshit.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.450
I know the two of you
had a dustup

14:02.493 --> 14:03.625
on the Ickaris tour.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.018
- I'm telling you,
it was nothing.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.758
- And I'm telling you
that whatever it is

14:06.802 --> 14:10.023
between the two of you
needs to end right now.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.025
- Okay.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.424
- I hope you're not here to
bust my balls about North Park.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.905
- North Park's in the past.
- I'll toast to that, my boy.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.515
- I hear Carlos Salazar
is thinking about

14:24.559 --> 14:26.430
throwing his hat in the ring.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.606
- You're not seriously worried
about some community organizer

14:28.650 --> 14:30.826
running against you, are you?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.828
- I'm worried about our funds.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.049
You got something
you want to tell me?

14:36.092 --> 14:37.964
- Shit, you're letting
that Pearson woman

14:38.007 --> 14:39.530
get in your head again,
aren't you?

14:39.574 --> 14:40.662
- You didn't answer
my question, Pat.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.925
- About what? Money?

14:42.969 --> 14:45.145
I've never been more flush.
You want to see my books?

14:45.188 --> 14:46.711
- Why would I?

14:46.755 --> 14:47.887
I'm sure the cash
you're getting from China

14:47.930 --> 14:49.540
is all under the table

14:49.584 --> 14:50.846
and the rest of your money
is hidden in the Caymans.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.761
- Well, you used to think
I was smart.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.154
- I used to think
a lot of things

14:54.197 --> 14:55.938
when you controlled
the purse strings.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.202
- You really want
to go it alone?

14:59.246 --> 15:00.943
- I don't see
as I have a choice.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.815
- This is exactly what I was
warning you about, Bobby.

15:03.859 --> 15:04.991
She's playing you.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.080
- Yeah, one of you is.
That I know.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.777
- Yeah? Well, who do
you trust more,

15:08.820 --> 15:10.779
someone whose house
you ran around as a kid

15:10.822 --> 15:13.956
or some woman
who blackmailed you into a job?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.566
Look, you're looking
to cut somebody loose,

15:15.610 --> 15:18.221
do yourself a favor:
make it her.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.658
You're being played.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.804
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

15:35.847 --> 15:36.979
I-I was just knocking.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.807
- Yeah, so were you able
to find out

15:38.850 --> 15:40.113
why the trucks are there?

15:40.156 --> 15:42.115
- The developer got
an emergency permit.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.117
He starts phased demolition
on Monday.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.511
-  So all that talk
about 90 days is bullshit.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.991
- It was not bullshit
on my end.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.820
I had an agreement,
but they found a loophole,

15:51.863 --> 15:53.126
and there's no way
to stop it.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.910
- Come on, Jessica.
You work for the mayor.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.216
- That doesn't give me
the power to--

15:56.259 --> 15:57.957
- You could if you wanted to.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.873
- It's over, Angela.

16:01.917 --> 16:04.224
- I'm sorry.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.008
- So that's it.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.836
- At this point,

16:07.879 --> 16:10.795
it would be like putting
Band-Aids on a dying patient.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.799
- Wow.
- I know that sound harsh,

16:14.843 --> 16:17.106
and I'm--I'm sorry.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.847
- No.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.023
It's okay.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.330
Uh, thanks for looking
into that for me.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.636
- You know
you can stay with me

16:25.680 --> 16:27.551
until you get on your feet.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.684
-  Yeah, right,
like that's ever gonna happen.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.252
- Oh, Angela. No, I--
- Mm-mm.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.694
- Hey.

16:42.088 --> 16:46.614
I'm sorry that I iced you out
like that back there.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.704
- Mm-hmm, it's clear you think
I'm radioactive. I get it.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.880
- I'm sorry.

16:51.923 --> 16:54.926
We work in the same place,
bound to work together.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.320
That's all I wanted to say.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.670
- Uh, Jessica told you
to do this, didn't she?

16:59.714 --> 17:02.934
- Uh-uh. Nope. Not true.
This is me.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.850
- 'Cause I'm not gonna accept
an apology if it's tainted.

17:07.330 --> 17:10.377
- Yes, she did.
Straight up ordered me.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.770
- Well, I have to say that the
fact that she told you to do it

17:12.814 --> 17:14.685
does take away
from the gesture.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.732
- You don't make anything easy,
do you?

17:19.908 --> 17:23.346
- I'm sorry.
I don't know why I do that.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.394
- Doesn't matter.
We're good.

17:27.437 --> 17:28.830
- I think I go on the attack

17:28.873 --> 17:32.660
because I-I want
to beat people to it.

17:32.703 --> 17:37.273
- You mean the way you did
when I tried to save your job?

17:37.317 --> 17:39.971
- That was you trying
to save my job?

17:40.015 --> 17:42.148
You could've just said you were
trying to save my job

17:42.191 --> 17:43.975
or not fire me at all.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.368
- I will see you later.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.726
- Mr. Steiner,

17:55.770 --> 17:57.946
thank you so much for meeting
me on such short notice.

17:57.989 --> 18:01.297
- Well, it just so happens
I had a cancellation today,

18:01.341 --> 18:04.257
and my secretary said
I'd been offered a free lunch

18:04.300 --> 18:05.736
with a beautiful lady.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.912
- I like how this
is starting already.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.262
- Well, don't get any ideas.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.829
- I'll do my best to keep it
purely professional.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.658
Thank you.
I'll have what he's having.

18:14.702 --> 18:18.053
- So I hear you work
for our esteemed mayor.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.359
- He's doing
some great things,

18:19.402 --> 18:21.056
and I wanted to be
a part of it.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.232
In fact, I'd like to continue
to be a part of it

18:23.276 --> 18:24.929
for another four years.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.409
- Ah, I should've guessed.

18:26.453 --> 18:29.151
You're looking to add
to his war chest.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.979
- You and the mayor stand
for a lot of the same things.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.285
There's no reason you're not

18:32.328 --> 18:34.156
one of his biggest supporters
already.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.766
- Oh, you don't have
to sell me.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.116
I've been a big fan.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.030
- Oh, that's good to hear.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.816
- First time I saw Bobby, it
was when he was giving a speech

18:41.859 --> 18:43.774
up at Northwestern.
- Thank you.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.341
- That's my alma mater.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.474
Here was this brash
young alderman

18:47.517 --> 18:51.173
talking about race
and inequality in Chicago.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.044
He stood there and spoke
for over an hour.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.699
- Hmm.
- Completely riveting.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.875
If he'd been a racehorse,
I would've bet it all.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.008
- I sense a "but" coming.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.489
- I know you're new to Chicago,
Ms. Pearson,

19:02.532 --> 19:05.883
but even you must know
who's really calling the shots.

19:05.927 --> 19:09.322
- If you're talking about
Pat McGann, he went in early.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.411
He's bound to have influence.

19:11.454 --> 19:14.022
- This goes way beyond that,
and you know it.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.980
Your man is compromised.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.766
I cannot be a part of that.

19:18.809 --> 19:21.072
- Can I be blunt?

19:21.116 --> 19:23.118
- As long as you're
picking up the check.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.207
- I'm not in the dark
about who Pat McGann is,

19:25.251 --> 19:26.904
and neither is the mayor.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.776
That's why we're looking
to be done with him.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.169
- It's a little late for that.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.475
Once he got into bed
with that butcher,

19:32.519 --> 19:34.173
he showed his true colors.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.305
- Butcher?

19:36.349 --> 19:39.134
That's a very strong word,
don't you think?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.180
- You really are new
to this town, aren't you?

19:41.223 --> 19:43.007
Sorry to waste your time.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.724
- You must be Nick.
- And you are?

20:03.767 --> 20:05.116
- Jeff Malone.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.596
Jessica and I live together.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.207
- Well, how'd you know
who I was?

20:08.250 --> 20:11.166
- Oh, Jessica described you
to a T, man.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.428
Good-looking Chicago cop

20:12.472 --> 20:14.256
with a striking resemblance
to the mayor.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.171
- I'll take good-looking.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.523
She's on the fifth floor,
in case you don't know.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.612
- Oh, I'm actually headed
up there right now.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.703
Hey, listen, um...

20:28.662 --> 20:31.360
Just so you know,

20:31.404 --> 20:36.191
Jessica, you know,
she tells me everything.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.454
Sometimes I wish
she wouldn't, but...

20:40.326 --> 20:42.589
Thanks for looking out for her
when I'm not around.

20:44.591 --> 20:47.289
Even so, if you ever feel
the need to call me...

20:48.725 --> 20:50.292
I used to be with Justice,

20:50.336 --> 20:51.511
but now I'm with McDermott.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.516
- Will do.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.300
- Thanks, buddy.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.749
- How sure are you about
McGann's money problems?

21:12.793 --> 21:15.230
- Very sure. Why?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.319
- 'Cause I saw him today
and he denied it.

21:17.363 --> 21:20.104
What'd you expect him to do,

21:20.148 --> 21:22.411
say that he was cutting back
on his cleaning woman?

21:22.455 --> 21:24.065
- He says it's a story
you cooked up

21:24.108 --> 21:25.632
to create a rift
between us.

21:25.675 --> 21:27.634
- Well, then I guess it comes
down to, who do you believe,

21:27.677 --> 21:28.765
him or me?

21:28.809 --> 21:30.332
- That's exactly what he said.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.768
- Then pick a side,

21:31.812 --> 21:33.204
because you've got
a reelection to finance

21:33.248 --> 21:34.467
and the clock is ticking.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.512
- You better be right.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.081
- Good.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.213
Now we can get to work.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.606
Derrick sent me a list
of top donors.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.173
- Screw the list.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.349
None of those people
give a shit about me.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.482
What we need is someone
who wants to stick it to McGann

21:49.525 --> 21:51.048
as much as I do.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.355
- The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.791
- Exactly.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.358
- Do you have someone in mind?

21:56.402 --> 21:59.187
- I have the perfect person
in mind.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.626
- Can I help you?

22:03.670 --> 22:05.715
- God, I hope so.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.326
I'm looking
for Jessica Pearson.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.675
- Oh, she's in with the mayor.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.851
You're Jeff! Yoli.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.201
I'm the one--we--
we spoke on the phone.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.724
Yeah.
- Oh, right. Right.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.378
It's so nice to meet you.
- It's so nice to meet you.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.511
Wow, you're just like how
I imagined you.

22:18.554 --> 22:21.209
Very Morris Chestnut.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.429
- Thanks...I think.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.692
- Hey. Did you meet the mayor?

22:25.735 --> 22:27.389
- Oh, he nodded
in my direction.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.391
- Oh, he must like you.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.262
Jeff, I'm sorry about today.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.786
- Hey, I get it.
You're working.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.265
I just stopped by to see
if we could grab a quick dinner

22:34.309 --> 22:35.702
before I head to O'Hare.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.312
- You're leaving tonight?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.705
- I'm on the red-eye
back to Miami.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.489
- Jeff, I didn't mean
to be here all day.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.404
Just one thing led
to another and...

22:42.448 --> 22:44.145
- Jess, I'm not upset.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.494
But I do have
to get back to work,

22:45.538 --> 22:47.409
and you of all people
should understand that.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.845
- Dinner it is.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.412
- I made a reservation
for the two of you

22:50.456 --> 22:51.718
at Riccardo at 9:00.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.110
That should give you
at least two hours

22:53.154 --> 22:54.111
to get to O'Hare
and check in,

22:54.155 --> 22:55.330
which shouldn't be a problem

22:55.374 --> 22:56.549
'cause I already
checked you in.

22:56.592 --> 22:57.767
So you can go
right to the gate.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.421
Um, uh, sorry.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.771
Just carry on.

23:01.815 --> 23:04.687
- Oh, I really like this one,
Jess.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.210
She's a keeper.

23:06.254 --> 23:08.430
- Yes.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.432
Yes, she is.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.434
- I'll get my coat.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.270
- ♪ People try to talk to me

23:22.313 --> 23:24.707
♪ I tell them
that their talk is cheap ♪

23:24.751 --> 23:27.318
♪ I don't want to hear you

23:27.362 --> 23:28.929
- I know I don't have
the right.

23:28.972 --> 23:31.497
- No, you don't.
- I said I know.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.282
But you drop that on me
and get in my head

23:34.325 --> 23:36.937
and expect me
not to react?

23:36.980 --> 23:39.722
- You asked.
- I didn't ask.

23:39.766 --> 23:42.333
You did it to mess with me,
and you succeeded.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.295
- Oh, Jesus.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.210
Bobby, the mayor
being stuck in an elevator

23:49.253 --> 23:50.603
is gonna get some attention.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.431
- Well, then we better
get unstuck.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.783
What do you want?
You want details?

23:56.826 --> 23:58.524
You want to know his name?
- For starters.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.874
- Okay, his name is Luke.
He's sexy. He's 35.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.615
We, uh--we met here,
actually.

24:02.658 --> 24:03.877
He was the photographer
that took my picture

24:03.920 --> 24:05.574
for the website,
and then we went out

24:05.618 --> 24:07.750
and we met for a whiskey
at this place on Lincoln,

24:07.794 --> 24:09.796
and then we slept
together twice.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.539
Sounds like a great guy.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.497
Why aren't you dating him?

24:17.368 --> 24:19.501
- Because there's something
wrong with me

24:19.545 --> 24:22.635
and I told him
that I'm in a relationship.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.767
How fucked up is that?

24:25.812 --> 24:28.641
- We are in a relationship.

24:35.952 --> 24:38.520
- I need you, Keri.

24:45.005 --> 24:47.268
- Just start this thing.

25:04.024 --> 25:07.331
- The best part
of the whole trial

25:07.375 --> 25:08.768
is the Cuban sandwich place
right down the street

25:08.811 --> 25:11.466
from the courthouse.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.772
You think you're gonna
make it down there?

25:12.815 --> 25:14.556
This thing could
drag on for a while.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.775
- Hmm.

25:20.736 --> 25:22.869
- What's going on, Jess?

25:22.912 --> 25:25.524
- Nothing.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.700
No, we're having
a lovely dinner.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.702
- Yes, but I just asked you

25:29.745 --> 25:31.573
when you might come down
to Miami.

25:31.617 --> 25:32.922
Did you even hear me?

25:32.966 --> 25:36.273
- Oh, Jeff.
I have so much to do here.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.755
- Hey.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.801
You tried, Jess.

25:41.844 --> 25:45.326
They can't expect
anything more than that.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.070
- I sold them out.
- What?

25:50.113 --> 25:51.767
You did your best.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.682
That's all you've been doing
since you got here.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.597
- I sold them out.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.600
You're the one who said it.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.820
- I was angry and I didn't
want you taking that job

26:00.863 --> 26:02.473
with the mayor.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.998
But you have to start taking
your own advice here.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.608
Let it go. Move on.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.392
- They're family.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.394
I should've done more
to help them.

26:10.438 --> 26:14.050
- They've been your family
for, like, 15 minutes.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.617
- What's that supposed
to mean?

26:15.661 --> 26:17.619
- It means they're strangers.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.448
You don't know them.
They don't know you.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.623
And you're trying to make up

26:21.667 --> 26:22.755
for something
that your father did,

26:22.798 --> 26:24.539
and that's not
your responsibility.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.324
You want family?

26:27.368 --> 26:28.761
Your family is sitting
right here in front of you

26:28.804 --> 26:30.937
and you can't see it.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.939
- I know you're my family.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.506
- Do you?

26:35.550 --> 26:39.772
- If you're my family,
then they're your family too.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.817
And if you can't accept that,

26:41.861 --> 26:43.427
then we have a bigger problem

26:43.471 --> 26:45.995
than whether I can get
to Miami or not.

26:46.039 --> 26:49.956
- ♪ I been fighting fires
too long ♪

26:49.999 --> 26:51.653
♪ And I won't go down
in flames ♪

26:58.529 --> 27:00.488
- Jeff, what are you
doing here?

27:00.531 --> 27:02.751
- You're a nurse, aren't you?

27:02.795 --> 27:05.145
- I'm gonna be. Why?

27:05.188 --> 27:09.236
- Well, in my day, nurses were
supposed to be compassionate.

27:10.977 --> 27:12.979
- You got something
you want to say to me?

27:13.022 --> 27:16.069
- The woman I care about
has turned her life upside down

27:16.112 --> 27:17.461
to get to know you,

27:17.505 --> 27:19.812
and you don't seem
to care one goddamn bit.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.248
- Hold up, wait.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.032
Me and my family are about
to be out on the street

27:23.076 --> 27:24.947
and she got a new job out of
the deal but she's the victim?

27:24.991 --> 27:26.079
- Nah, I didn't say
she was a victim.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.428
I asked you why you don't care.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.256
- I didn't ask her
to come to Chicago, Jeff.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.823
- You also don't ask people
to walk through the doors

27:30.866 --> 27:33.042
of your hospital either,
but once they do,

27:33.086 --> 27:36.437
I know you try to understand
how they're feeling.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.873
I also know you don't ask them

27:37.917 --> 27:40.354
how much money
they make either.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.748
- Look, I don't know
what you want from me, okay?

27:42.791 --> 27:44.314
If Jessica sent you over here
to smooth things over--

27:44.358 --> 27:46.012
- Oh, believe me, Angela.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.231
I'm the last person that
she would send over here.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.886
I told her you were all
a bunch of strangers.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.845
- Okay, well,
if that is the case,

27:52.888 --> 27:55.064
what are you doing here?

27:55.108 --> 27:58.589
- I'm here because
her heart is breaking

27:58.633 --> 28:03.464
and I just can't stand
to see her in pain.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.989
And it's starting to affect us,

28:07.033 --> 28:10.514
and, well,
that just pisses me off.

28:11.951 --> 28:15.084
- Okay, so this
is really about you.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.217
- Goddamn,
you two must be related.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.262
- We are. Deal with it.

28:19.306 --> 28:23.005
- Well, if you are,
then let her in, Angela.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.791
Look, I know you're going
through hell

28:25.834 --> 28:29.795
and she hasn't been able to fix
everything, but she's trying.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.187
She wants you in her life,

28:31.231 --> 28:33.015
and something tells me
that you do too,

28:33.059 --> 28:36.540
but you got to give
a little something here.

28:40.849 --> 28:42.895
Any chance of getting
arroz con frijoles?

28:42.938 --> 28:45.375
I've been craving it all day.

28:45.419 --> 28:48.117
I'm gonna help.
I promise.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.859
Mira.What's wrong?

28:55.864 --> 28:57.257
- She didn't come home.

28:58.911 --> 29:02.001
- Oh, um, she has the
Burnhams' house on Tuesdays.

29:02.044 --> 29:04.481
So the buses from Lake Forest
are always late.

29:05.395 --> 29:08.311
- She left there at 3:00.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.531
She called me
when she was leaving.

29:16.189 --> 29:18.844
- Papi, what's going on?

29:19.627 --> 29:23.370
- Your mother had
her check-in with ICE today.

29:25.546 --> 29:27.113
- Oh, my God.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.031
I forgot.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.164
- I need to go down there.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.166
- No, you can't go down there

29:37.210 --> 29:39.212
because they're--
they're gonna take you too.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.171
Okay?

29:42.215 --> 29:44.391
Hey.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.569
- It's gonna be okay, Papi.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.398
- Okay, mi cielo.

30:01.147 --> 30:04.498
- Ah, Mr. Mayor.

30:04.541 --> 30:05.978
- Tom.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.936
- This is my adviser,
Jessica Pearson.

30:07.980 --> 30:10.504
- Ah, adviser.
Well, what are you,

30:10.547 --> 30:12.419
the, uh, the good cop
or the bad cop?

30:12.462 --> 30:14.464
- I'm the one who cuts
through the bullshit.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.466
- Oh, I like that.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.208
Bob should have brought you on
a long time ago.

30:19.252 --> 30:20.470
Please, sit.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.648
- Well, let me be the one

30:24.692 --> 30:26.346
to cut through
the bullshit now.

30:26.389 --> 30:30.002
- You want to renegotiate
the lease on Lincoln Yards.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.525
- Why would I do that?

30:31.568 --> 30:34.049
- Oh, you're about to win
the Ickaris sweepstakes,

30:34.093 --> 30:36.573
and I own the land,

30:36.617 --> 30:39.315
and you want to hand over the
project to one of your cronies.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.491
- The only part of that
I want to change

30:41.535 --> 30:43.493
is what you call cronies.

30:43.537 --> 30:46.279
- The mayor is looking
for a new primary donor

30:46.322 --> 30:49.021
to fund his reelection.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.761
- I know you're no fan, Tom.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.763
- And you know
goddamn well why.

30:52.807 --> 30:55.331
- That's why I'm trying
to get out from under him.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.593
- You have to admire
a politician

30:56.637 --> 30:58.421
who admits to being a puppet.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.249
- I was young.
I made a mistake.

31:00.293 --> 31:03.252
- The man calls himself
a developer.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.601
He's a thug.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.690
- Like I said, I was young.

31:06.734 --> 31:09.519
- Tommy Diehl
was a friend of mine.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.087
- I know that.
Listen to me.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.350
The only thing Pat McGann
wants more than his name

31:14.394 --> 31:17.571
on the tallest building
in Chicago is to be you.

31:17.614 --> 31:20.443
You want to make him obsolete,
this is your chance.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.141
- Hmm.

31:22.184 --> 31:25.579
- Mr. Mayor, we don't want
to keep Allan Steiner waiting.

31:25.622 --> 31:28.451
I mean, clearly,
Mr. Lauder isn't interested.

31:28.495 --> 31:31.672
- All right, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

31:34.675 --> 31:37.243
Okay, I'm not gonna write you
a blank check.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.114
But I'm willing to talk.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.698
- Who's Tommy Diehl?

32:00.179 --> 32:02.137
- He's ancient history.

32:02.181 --> 32:05.140
- Didn't seem like ancient
history to that man back there.

32:05.184 --> 32:06.794
- He was a Teamster boss
back in the day.

32:06.837 --> 32:09.231
- What happened to him?

32:09.275 --> 32:10.754
- Disappeared.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.626
Body was never found.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.542
There are rumors McGann
had something to do with it.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.196
- Rumors?

32:17.239 --> 32:20.068
- If you're asking me
do I think McGann killed him,

32:20.112 --> 32:22.505
no, I don't think so.

32:22.549 --> 32:25.247
If I did, I never would have
gotten involved with him.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.207
- Well, you just let Lauder
believe that he did it.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.557
- Well, to get us out
from under it?

32:30.600 --> 32:32.689
I would have let him think
McGann started World War II

32:32.733 --> 32:36.258
and invented cancer.

32:36.302 --> 32:37.738
That's great to hear.

32:37.781 --> 32:40.175
- I'm glad you approve.

32:40.219 --> 32:43.352
- If you're willing to pin
a murder on McGann,

32:43.396 --> 32:45.528
then you really
must be done with him.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.793
- Okay, Nick, all clear.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.160
- Hope you didn't make
any plans.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.813
It's gonna be a long night.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.511
- Just tell me where you want
to order takeout.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.165
- Yeah, well,
we'll get to that.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.993
First things first.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.865
This is everything we need
to know on Thomas Lauder

33:17.908 --> 33:21.347
and his list of demands if
he's going to back the mayor.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.784
You'd like him.
He's principled.

33:27.135 --> 33:28.528
Everything okay?

33:28.571 --> 33:31.792
- Yeah, yeah. Uh, principled.
List of demands.

33:31.835 --> 33:34.186
- Okay. First we have to see
what's feasible.

33:34.229 --> 33:35.752
He's asked for the moon.

33:35.796 --> 33:37.406
Let's see what we have
in the way of stars.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.365
Um, linkage fees...
- Mm-hmm.

33:39.408 --> 33:41.889
- Expedited permits,
variances--

33:41.932 --> 33:44.544
um, huh, you like how
I've picked up the jargon?

33:48.287 --> 33:50.071
- Do you need to get that?

33:50.115 --> 33:52.943
- No, no, no. I'm okay.
- Good.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.815
Now, I need you
to run me through a list

33:54.858 --> 33:56.295
of department heads and the
best way to sweet-talk them

33:56.338 --> 33:58.079
into doing us a favor.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.953
- You know I don't like it when
you edit without telling me.

34:02.997 --> 34:04.172
- I'm taking out
the word "promise."

34:04.216 --> 34:05.913
You use it too much.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.349
- Well, it hard not to use
the P word when you're talking

34:07.393 --> 34:09.003
about the promise Ickaris made
to put us top five.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.788
- When we seal the deal,
we can use the P word.

34:11.832 --> 34:12.920
- Okay, and what are you doing

34:12.963 --> 34:14.530
to seal
the aforementioned deal?

34:14.574 --> 34:17.403
- I have had a back channel
with the CEO for weeks.

34:17.446 --> 34:19.100
Good enough for you?

34:19.144 --> 34:21.972
- Barack, give me
and your boss a minute.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.027
- That's not all right.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.208
What do you want?

34:40.252 --> 34:41.470
- Yeah, I remember once,

34:41.514 --> 34:43.037
this shit bag
told your old man

34:43.081 --> 34:44.908
that his guys were about
to get laid off

34:44.952 --> 34:46.127
from one of my jobs.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.476
He told them
that he heard the city

34:47.520 --> 34:51.089
was gonna shut me down
for code violations.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.396
Says to Pete, says, "Hey,
your guys come over to me,

34:54.440 --> 34:56.268
I'll give them overtime."

34:56.311 --> 34:59.619
He even offered your pops a
little extra as a service fee.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.403
- I don't have time
to go down memory lane, Pat.

35:01.447 --> 35:04.319
- Your dad didn't even call me
to see if it was true.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.234
He just told
the son of a bitch

35:06.278 --> 35:08.149
to get the hell off
the property

35:08.193 --> 35:10.543
before he ordered his men to
beat the shit out of him, yeah.

35:10.586 --> 35:13.981
That was Pete Novak.

35:14.024 --> 35:15.939
- Is there a point
to this story?

35:15.983 --> 35:19.204
- Yeah, the point is, there's
a thing called blind loyalty.

35:19.247 --> 35:22.294
- If I remember,
that was his downfall.

35:22.337 --> 35:23.643
- Who do you think you are

35:23.686 --> 35:26.211
going to Thomas Lauder
for financing?

35:26.254 --> 35:27.516
- It's business, Pat.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.040
- That silver spoon
piece of shit.

35:30.084 --> 35:33.000
You think he'd let you in his
club if you weren't mayor?

35:33.043 --> 35:34.610
- I told you

35:34.654 --> 35:37.222
if you can't pull your weight,
I'd have to go elsewhere.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.919
- Pull my weight?

35:40.181 --> 35:42.009
I own you.

35:44.577 --> 35:47.145
- You don't own shit.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.450
- What'd you say to me?

35:48.494 --> 35:50.365
- You don't own your buildings.

35:50.409 --> 35:53.020
You don't own the land
they're on.

35:53.063 --> 35:56.154
And most importantly,
you don't own me.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.938
- You forgetting
a little something?

36:00.070 --> 36:03.465
- I'm sick and tired of you
holding that over my head.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.511
You want to drop that bomb
and blow yourself up too?

36:05.554 --> 36:07.034
Be my guest.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.470
But for now,

36:08.514 --> 36:10.472
get the fuck out
of my office.

36:10.516 --> 36:11.995
I've got a city to run.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.181
- Hi, it's Yoli Castillo again.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.356
I'm so sorry I missed
your call.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.314
Please call me back.
Thanks.

36:36.411 --> 36:40.110
Aztec Dave's on Madison today,
if you want to grab a bite.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.244
- I'm not hungry.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.593
- You okay?

36:44.637 --> 36:46.291
Didn't get fired again,
did you?

36:49.294 --> 36:50.295
That was a joke.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.386
What's up?

36:54.429 --> 36:56.562
- Oh, uh, it's nothing.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.391
- Look, I don't know you,

36:59.434 --> 37:01.697
but I know you.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.613
I can tell something's
bothering you.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.403
- I'm DACA.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.231
You know that, right?

37:13.274 --> 37:15.407
- No, but so?

37:15.450 --> 37:17.452
- My parents, though...

37:17.496 --> 37:20.586
- Oh, shit. I mean, if you're
worried about something

37:20.629 --> 37:23.197
coming back around
on the mayor, it's...

37:23.241 --> 37:26.026
- No. My mom was picked up
by ICE last night.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.202
- What?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.595
- I mean, she wasn't really
picked up.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.379
She was on a bus
a few years ago

37:31.423 --> 37:33.642
when they did a routine sweep,

37:33.686 --> 37:36.123
and ever since,
she has to check in.

37:36.166 --> 37:39.300
Uh, usually it's fine,
but, uh, last night...

37:41.346 --> 37:43.173
They're not letting her go.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.133
- Shit.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.135
Did you tell Jessica?

37:48.178 --> 37:50.268
- No, no. I--

37:50.311 --> 37:51.356
I can't be a problem to her.

37:51.399 --> 37:53.575
- Yoli, this is your mom.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.317
- No. Please.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.710
Don't say anything.

37:58.841 --> 38:03.106
- I won't. I won't.
It's okay.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.065
- Hey.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.328
It's gonna be okay.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.334
- Your turn.

38:13.378 --> 38:16.206
- Are you kidding me?

38:16.250 --> 38:18.078
- You know
it's a game of luck, right?

38:18.121 --> 38:20.167
- Says the man
who always loses.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.740
- Shh, shh, shh.
Peace, peace.

38:27.783 --> 38:30.351
Shh. Shh.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.333
I have to get going.
- I know.

38:58.901 --> 39:03.558
- I would like nothing more
than to wake up with you.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.781
-  Well...

39:11.566 --> 39:14.308
Not really possible,
is it?

39:17.137 --> 39:18.573
Why not?

39:19.835 --> 39:24.144
- Because of this crazy
puritanical society we live in.

39:24.187 --> 39:27.321
Everybody cares
where the mayor sleeps.

39:29.410 --> 39:32.413
- Well, in L.A., they don't.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.416
- We don't live in L.A.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.245
- I have a mayors conference
there next month.

39:38.288 --> 39:39.551
Come with me.

39:42.292 --> 39:44.294
- Bobby.
- I'm serious.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.297
- People--
- We need time together.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.256
- People will wonder
why I'm there.

39:49.299 --> 39:50.736
- People here?

39:50.779 --> 39:54.217
- Here, there.
It won't look right.

39:54.261 --> 39:57.569
- You're the city attorney.
You're not some secretary.

39:57.612 --> 40:00.354
There's plenty for you to do.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.312
Come with me.

40:09.711 --> 40:12.410
Yes.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.502
- Ah, you know what?
You're right.

40:17.545 --> 40:18.764
It's a terrible idea.

40:18.807 --> 40:19.765
I think people probably
will judge us.

40:19.808 --> 40:21.593
- Oh, you!

40:37.435 --> 40:39.306
- Hi!

40:39.349 --> 40:42.570
- Uh, Jessica,
everything okay?

40:42.614 --> 40:44.616
We--we didn't scare you,
did we?

40:44.659 --> 40:46.661
- Jeff gave me his key.

40:46.705 --> 40:49.969
- Oh, he did, did he?

40:50.012 --> 40:51.449
Hmm.

40:52.885 --> 40:54.495
- Hey, little man!

40:54.539 --> 40:55.627
Did you ask Cousin Jessica

40:55.670 --> 40:56.802
if it's okay to go in there?

40:56.845 --> 40:58.412
- No.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.676
- You know what?

41:01.720 --> 41:03.548
I'm in the mood
for some ice cream.

41:05.550 --> 41:06.986
Yeah, but hey!

41:07.029 --> 41:08.727
Your mother said you
didn't like ice cream.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.468
- I do like ice cream!
- You do?

41:10.511 --> 41:11.947
- Hey, don't be eating
too much.

41:11.991 --> 41:14.907
- Do you like coffee ice cream?
- Yes!

41:14.950 --> 41:17.518
- No, no.
Do you like cookies and cream?

41:17.562 --> 41:19.302
- Yeah, yeah,
cookies and cream!

41:19.346 --> 41:21.348
- Cookies and cream.
Cookies and cream.

41:21.391 --> 41:23.611
Oh! Oh!

41:24.482 --> 41:26.571
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:26.614 --> 41:27.876
- Boys asleep?

41:29.617 --> 41:31.619
It's almost 10:00 p.m.

41:31.663 --> 41:33.578
Of course they're asleep.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.536
- Lost track of time.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.538
How are you feeling?
Did you give yourself the shot?

41:37.582 --> 41:38.887
- Not yet.

41:38.931 --> 41:40.454
- Do you want me to do it?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.369
- Where were you tonight?

41:43.892 --> 41:45.807
- Kiwanis Club.

41:45.851 --> 41:48.984
- Because I called Nick, and he
didn't know where you were.

41:49.028 --> 41:51.726
- Nick's been driving for
the Pearson woman most days.

41:53.772 --> 41:55.600
You can call Dave Boltansky
over there,

41:55.643 --> 41:56.862
you don't believe me.

41:56.905 --> 41:59.865
- I was just wondering.

41:59.908 --> 42:00.996
- Hmm.

42:02.824 --> 42:04.652
- All right, well,
I'm gonna go up.

42:07.046 --> 42:10.310
Pat McGann
dropped this off for you.

42:10.353 --> 42:11.964
- He was here?

42:12.007 --> 42:13.705
When?

42:13.748 --> 42:15.489
- I don't know.
He said you were expecting him.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.659
- Aaron. Aaron!

42:55.964 --> 42:57.444
- Oy.
