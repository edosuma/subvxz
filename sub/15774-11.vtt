00:06.000 --> 00:08.868
We could probably find
free parking on the street.

00:08.903 --> 00:11.304
- Porky. You've got to learn
to treat yourself right.

00:11.338 --> 00:14.502
Enjoy the finer things in life.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.845
All right...

00:21.880 --> 00:23.110
Pay-yule.

00:23.145 --> 00:24.377
It's "Paul".

00:24.411 --> 00:25.311
Paul.

00:25.346 --> 00:27.612
I am guessing
you've never driven a vehicle

00:27.646 --> 00:29.014
Quite like this one.

00:29.048 --> 00:32.316
- No, sir, I haven't.
Are those the... Keys?

00:32.350 --> 00:35.451
- First of all, I could do
without the attitude.

00:35.485 --> 00:39.023
Second of all,
these are obviously pliers.

00:39.057 --> 00:42.395
Because the ignition key
is obviously broken off

00:42.430 --> 00:44.130
In the ignition itself,

00:44.164 --> 00:46.932
Obviously due to a fit I had

00:46.966 --> 00:50.126
Regarding a personal matter.

00:55.421 --> 00:57.690
And don't get any ideas!

00:57.725 --> 00:59.593
I locked the glove compartment.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.929
Hey, sometimes you've got
to treat people wrong

01:02.964 --> 01:06.365
To treat yourself right. Tcch.

The Looney Tunes Show, Season 2, Episode 11
"We're In Big Truffle"

01:29.200 --> 01:31.367
I'll have the truffle risotto.

01:31.402 --> 01:33.902
- Everything's
kind of expensive.

01:33.937 --> 01:36.138
Porky, we'll split the bill.

01:36.172 --> 01:37.839
Aww.

01:37.873 --> 01:40.542
He'll have what I'm having.

01:40.576 --> 01:44.313
Porky, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:44.347 --> 01:47.050
You have to learn
to pamper yourself.

01:47.084 --> 01:50.120
Valet parking, nice meals,

01:50.154 --> 01:53.157
French manicures.

01:53.191 --> 01:56.661
These are the things
that give you a sense of worth.

01:56.696 --> 01:59.630
- What about hard work?
Friendship?

01:59.665 --> 02:01.098
Ha ha ha ha ha!

02:01.132 --> 02:03.400
Good one.

02:03.801 --> 02:06.770
what's that?

02:06.804 --> 02:09.573
Truffle. It's a delicacy.

02:09.608 --> 02:12.010
Mmm.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.678
Mmm. Ohh.

02:13.712 --> 02:15.179
It's like eating gold!

02:15.214 --> 02:18.817
Mmm. Truffle, where
have you been all my life?

02:18.851 --> 02:21.820
Oh, it is delicious.

02:21.854 --> 02:25.591
To treating yourself right.

02:28.028 --> 02:29.728
- What's up, neighbor?
- Hey, Bugs.

02:29.763 --> 02:33.299
I was wondering if Gossamer
could stay with you this weekend?

02:33.333 --> 02:34.934
Sure. Where you going?

02:34.968 --> 02:35.935
The fifth dimension.

02:35.969 --> 02:38.371
- Oh. Uh, is that
where you're from?

02:38.406 --> 02:40.006
- What?! Honey,
I'm from Chicago.

02:40.041 --> 02:43.643
The fifth dimension is where
they're holding the witches convention.

02:43.678 --> 02:46.513
They teach you all the new
spells and broom tricks.

02:46.548 --> 02:49.083
- Sounds great.
We'll take good care of him.

02:49.117 --> 02:52.286
- "we"? Oh.
I forgot about Daffy.

02:52.321 --> 02:54.522
Any chance you can baby-sit
at my house?

02:54.556 --> 02:58.159
- Ooh. I've never stayed
at a haunted house before.

02:58.194 --> 03:00.528
- It's not haunted!
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

03:00.562 --> 03:03.298
You make a lot of assumptions.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.335
Mmm.

03:10.106 --> 03:13.142
$500?!

03:13.176 --> 03:15.811
For risotto?!
- For the truffle.

03:15.845 --> 03:17.446
It should have been for free!

03:17.480 --> 03:19.414
The menu said "MP".

03:19.448 --> 03:22.917
Yes. "MP". Market price.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.419
Which, in this case,

03:24.454 --> 03:26.488
Is $250 a plate.

03:26.522 --> 03:28.023
Market price?

03:28.057 --> 03:30.292
MP stands for my pleasure!

03:30.326 --> 03:31.994
Like, here, take it.

03:32.028 --> 03:33.796
It's my pleasure.

03:33.830 --> 03:35.598
What are we going to do?

03:35.632 --> 03:38.467
Pay the bill. Here.

03:39.236 --> 03:40.670
This is $5.00.

03:40.704 --> 03:42.538
You said we'd split it.

03:42.572 --> 03:44.073
Right. We're splitting it.

03:44.108 --> 03:46.542
Me, $5.00, you rest of dollars.

03:46.577 --> 03:48.611
Splitting means 50/50!

03:48.645 --> 03:51.381
- Oh! And "MP"
means market price?

03:51.415 --> 03:54.984
What planet are we on?

03:58.056 --> 04:01.092
I'll get the valet.

04:01.126 --> 04:03.194
Hmmph!

04:03.228 --> 04:04.829
Bye-bye, baby.

04:04.863 --> 04:07.698
- now you do
what Mr. Bunny tells you.

04:07.733 --> 04:09.367
I'll be home Sunday night.

04:09.401 --> 04:11.002
You take good care of my son.

04:11.036 --> 04:13.204
We'll be great. Don't worry.

04:13.239 --> 04:15.474
You're gonna...?

04:15.675 --> 04:18.476
- You can't see past
the witchiness, can you?

04:18.511 --> 04:20.545
I'm taking my minivan.

04:20.579 --> 04:22.247
Unbelievable.

04:22.281 --> 04:26.385
What does he think I'm going
to do with all this luggage?

04:28.000 --> 04:34.074

04:40.867 --> 04:43.669
Ughh. Hey, speedy?

04:43.703 --> 04:45.204
You got any truffles back there?

04:45.238 --> 04:48.041
- Truffles? Who are you,
little Lord Fauntleroy?

04:48.075 --> 04:49.776
Do you know
how much truffles cost?

04:49.811 --> 04:52.815
The big ones
go for like $350,000.

04:52.849 --> 04:55.218
$350,000?

04:55.252 --> 04:57.320
Where would someone
get a truffle?

04:57.355 --> 04:59.422
- They grow on the ground,
near oak trees.

04:59.456 --> 05:01.224
But they're nearly
impossible to find.

05:01.258 --> 05:02.659
Needs pigs to sniff them out.

05:02.693 --> 05:05.161
Pigs, huh?

05:08.766 --> 05:09.866
Where are we going?

05:09.900 --> 05:14.705
- It's a surprise.
All right, start sniffing.

05:14.739 --> 05:16.140
Where are we?

05:16.174 --> 05:18.976
- Randall mcclintock
national park.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.544
What are we doing here?

05:20.578 --> 05:22.813
- Truffle hunting.
You're going to sniff 'em out,

05:22.847 --> 05:26.350
I'm going to dig 'em up,
and we're going to be rich.

05:26.385 --> 05:27.651
Sniff 'em out?!

05:27.686 --> 05:30.187
Daffy, I am not
that kind of a pig.

05:30.221 --> 05:32.156
I was born in the suburbs!

05:32.190 --> 05:34.292
I wear a blazer.

05:34.326 --> 05:35.927
Will you please just try?

05:35.961 --> 05:37.929
It's getting late!

05:42.034 --> 05:45.303
Ehh.

05:50.243 --> 05:54.245
- Ugh, your pig ancestors are
rolling over in their graves.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.715
Come on, Porky!
Sniff like you mean it!

06:00.053 --> 06:01.253
There you go.

06:01.288 --> 06:02.821
Find that truffle, piggy.

06:09.229 --> 06:11.864
Ok, Gossamer.

06:11.898 --> 06:12.999
Time for bed.

06:13.033 --> 06:16.335
who could that be?

06:16.370 --> 06:19.004
Hey, bun bun.

06:19.039 --> 06:20.206
Lola! I told you,

06:20.240 --> 06:23.409
I can't do anything this
weekend. I'm baby-sitting.

06:23.444 --> 06:24.877
- I know.
I thought I could help.

06:24.912 --> 06:27.847
- Well, that's very nice,
but I think I've got it covered.

06:27.881 --> 06:31.417
- Mr. Bunny, I think there's
a monster under my bed.

06:31.452 --> 06:34.754
- Are you kidding?
The monster's on the stairs!

06:34.789 --> 06:36.222
where?!

06:36.257 --> 06:37.657
- Let me handle this.
I put myself

06:37.691 --> 06:40.727
Through medical school
baby-sitting.

06:40.761 --> 06:44.097
Hey, Gossamer, how about
I read you a bedtime story?

06:44.131 --> 06:45.365
Yeah!

06:45.399 --> 06:48.101
Tchh.

06:48.135 --> 06:50.603
Dig, pig, dig!

06:50.638 --> 06:52.305
Dig, pig, dig!

06:52.339 --> 06:54.040
Dig, pig, dig!

06:54.075 --> 06:55.742
That is not helping.

06:55.776 --> 06:57.443
Why aren't you digging?

06:57.478 --> 06:59.011
My manicure.

06:59.046 --> 07:01.614
That's it. I'm done.

07:01.648 --> 07:04.082
Let's go home.

07:04.117 --> 07:06.819
Where's the car?

07:06.853 --> 07:08.487
Hmm.

07:08.521 --> 07:10.155
Hmm. Huh.

07:10.190 --> 07:11.924
- You don't know
where the car is?

07:11.959 --> 07:14.494
- Well, you don't know
where the car is!

07:14.528 --> 07:16.830
- That's because
you blindfolded me!

07:16.864 --> 07:18.498
- Well, I thought if you knew
where we were going,

07:18.533 --> 07:21.602
You wouldn't have come!
- I wouldn't have!

07:21.636 --> 07:23.404
You just proved my point!

07:23.438 --> 07:25.272
Ughh. Forget it.

07:25.306 --> 07:27.908
I'll find my own way home.

07:30.645 --> 07:32.046
Huh.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.880
What is it?

07:33.915 --> 07:35.749
I don't know.

07:35.783 --> 07:39.586
It's a... Giant truffle!

07:39.620 --> 07:41.187
Porky! You did it!

07:41.222 --> 07:43.256
We're rich, we're rich.

07:47.295 --> 07:49.763
We're rich!

07:49.797 --> 07:51.031
Um, Daffy?

07:51.065 --> 07:54.434
We're still lost, you know.

07:54.469 --> 07:58.505
Lost and... Rich!

07:58.539 --> 07:59.706
Oww!

08:13.354 --> 08:14.487
Bugs!

08:14.521 --> 08:16.522
What?! Is everything ok?

08:16.557 --> 08:19.292
- Everything's fine.
Nothing to worry about.

08:19.327 --> 08:21.360
Totally no big deal.

08:21.395 --> 08:24.497
But... Gossamer kind of, um,

08:24.532 --> 08:27.967
he turned into a frog.

08:32.559 --> 08:35.561
- What do you mean,
Gossamer turned into a frog?!

08:35.595 --> 08:36.595
What's this?

08:36.630 --> 08:38.364
- Well, I thought it was
a book of bedtime stories,

08:38.398 --> 08:41.366
But now I'm pretty sure
it's a book of spells.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.437
Wait! Before you go in there,
you should know one more thing.

08:44.471 --> 08:47.607
I think I might have also
turned Gossamer's alarm clock

08:47.641 --> 08:50.310
Into a great, big, ferocious
grizzly bear.

09:02.990 --> 09:05.524
Gossamer!

09:05.559 --> 09:07.493
You poor thing.
- Well...

09:07.527 --> 09:10.096
Looks like you got this covered.

09:10.130 --> 09:12.498
So, you know, I should probably

09:12.532 --> 09:15.567
Head on home.

09:17.237 --> 09:18.771
- I mean, uh, to get
a terrarium.

09:18.805 --> 09:21.440
To put Gossamer in
until we can figure out

09:21.474 --> 09:23.942
Which one of these spells
will turn him back...

09:23.976 --> 09:24.976
Is what I was saying.

09:25.010 --> 09:27.178
Oh, you thought
I was going to leave you.

09:35.587 --> 09:38.589
- I bet this baby
weighs three pounds.

09:38.624 --> 09:41.259
We're probably looking
at a half a million dollars!

09:41.293 --> 09:43.228
What are you going to do
with your ten percent?

09:43.262 --> 09:45.564
- Daffy?
We've been through this.

09:45.598 --> 09:47.900
If you say "split",
it means half.

09:47.934 --> 09:51.871
- Fine! So what are you
going to do with your "half"?

09:51.905 --> 09:53.139
I don't know.

09:53.173 --> 09:55.809
I've always been someone
who saves their money for a rainy day.

09:55.843 --> 09:59.547
- Come on. This is your chance
to treat yourself right.

09:59.581 --> 10:01.081
I guess I could buy a shirt.

10:01.116 --> 10:03.717
I mean, I never felt like
I needed a shirt.

10:03.752 --> 10:06.120
Considering I already had
a jacket and tie,

10:06.154 --> 10:07.588
It seems so extravagant.

10:07.623 --> 10:10.992
- That's why
you don't wear a shirt?!

10:11.027 --> 10:12.494
Because you're cheap?

10:12.528 --> 10:14.930
- Well, why don't you
wear clothes?

10:14.964 --> 10:17.432
Because I love my body.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.136
Check out my pecs, Porky.
Check 'em. Look at 'em.

10:21.171 --> 10:22.571
- Shh!
- What?!

10:22.606 --> 10:24.239
Shh, shh.

10:24.274 --> 10:25.007
What?!

10:25.041 --> 10:26.375
I think I hear something.

10:26.409 --> 10:28.977
- What do you think it is?
- A bear?

10:29.011 --> 10:31.613
- Porky! There hasn't been
a bear in these woods

10:31.648 --> 10:34.549
For a thousand years!

10:41.723 --> 10:43.691
Quick, fly us out of here!

10:43.725 --> 10:45.425
What?! I can't fly!

10:45.460 --> 10:46.627
But you're a duck!

10:46.661 --> 10:48.461
I'm not that kind of duck.

10:50.998 --> 10:54.433
- I always knew
I'd die this way!

10:56.870 --> 10:58.170
hi, yes.

10:58.204 --> 10:59.838
I called 9-1-1 last night,

10:59.873 --> 11:02.974
But I think the dispatcher
thought I was crazy.

11:03.009 --> 11:04.075
Oh, ok.

11:04.110 --> 11:06.879
Uh, well, I was baby-sitting
this monster, see,

11:06.913 --> 11:09.314
And my girlfriend accidentally
turned his alarm clock

11:09.348 --> 11:12.651
Into a grizzly bear,
and he escaped and ran away.

11:12.685 --> 11:14.953
hello?

11:16.690 --> 11:19.091
- I think I found
the spell I did last night.

11:19.126 --> 11:20.526
You think or you know?

11:20.560 --> 11:23.528
- I know. I mean,
I think I know.

11:23.563 --> 11:27.398
Well, that's great. But we need
the spell that reverses the spell.

11:27.433 --> 11:29.868
- It's this one.
It's definitely this one.

11:29.902 --> 11:32.203
I think. No, I mean, I know.

11:32.238 --> 11:36.241
I mean,
I think... I know.

11:36.275 --> 11:38.176
Just read it.

11:46.718 --> 11:49.487
What?

11:49.522 --> 11:51.523
Uh, nothing.

11:55.194 --> 11:58.396
Psst. I think the bear's gone.

11:58.430 --> 11:59.964
You ok?

11:59.999 --> 12:02.233
I'm fine.

12:02.268 --> 12:04.436
Is the truffle ok?

12:05.371 --> 12:07.538
I mean, are you ok?

12:07.573 --> 12:09.774
We've been walking for hours.

12:09.809 --> 12:11.576
Does any of this look familiar?

12:11.610 --> 12:15.179
- It all looks familiar.
Everything looks the same!

12:15.213 --> 12:16.547
I'm starving.

12:16.581 --> 12:19.483
I'm going to eat
into my half of the truffle.

12:19.517 --> 12:22.053
- Are you crazy?
That's like eating money.

12:22.087 --> 12:24.072
This is our future.

12:24.073 --> 12:26.057
No one's going to give us
a half a million dollars

12:26.091 --> 12:28.626
For a truffle
with a giant bite out of it!

12:28.661 --> 12:31.463
If you're hungry,
eat some berries.

12:31.497 --> 12:33.165
But what if they're poisonous?

12:33.199 --> 12:35.367
Then I'll know not to eat 'em.

12:46.345 --> 12:48.312
We have to jump!

12:48.346 --> 12:49.547
But I can't swim!

12:49.581 --> 12:52.416
- You can't fly,
you can't swim!

12:52.450 --> 12:55.619
Are you even a duck at all?!

12:55.654 --> 12:56.954
I'm not sure.

12:56.989 --> 13:00.825
This comes off very easily.

13:16.077 --> 13:18.846
- Porky!
- I'm here!

13:18.880 --> 13:20.581
I lost the truffle!

13:20.615 --> 13:23.551
There it is.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.887
I've got it! Ahh!

13:25.921 --> 13:27.422
I don't got it!

13:27.456 --> 13:30.258
I see it.

13:32.695 --> 13:34.729
Whoa!

13:37.900 --> 13:39.701
I got it!

13:39.736 --> 13:42.904
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
I love you, Porky pig!

13:42.939 --> 13:45.740
- Lola, none of these spells
are working.

13:45.775 --> 13:47.876
What?

13:47.910 --> 13:50.712
- Nothing. Maybe
we should call the witch.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.081
- Oh, no.
She entrusted me with Gossamer.

13:53.116 --> 13:56.151
We got to fix this on our own.
Let's not panic.

13:57.787 --> 13:59.788
Gossamer!

14:03.258 --> 14:04.892
We're saved!

14:04.926 --> 14:07.061
Aahh!

14:07.095 --> 14:10.365
Help! Whoa!

14:10.399 --> 14:11.566
Porky!

14:11.600 --> 14:13.268
Hold on.

14:13.302 --> 14:16.504
I can't!

14:17.173 --> 14:18.640
Let go of the truffle!

14:18.674 --> 14:19.941
Are you sure?

14:19.975 --> 14:21.676
I'm not going to say it twice!

14:21.711 --> 14:24.245
I can't believe
I said it once.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.514
Ok!

14:31.921 --> 14:34.889
You saved my life.

14:34.924 --> 14:36.491
It was MP.

14:36.525 --> 14:38.260
My pleasure.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.595
Turns out, treating others right

14:40.630 --> 14:43.732
Feels better than
treating yourself right.

14:43.766 --> 14:45.734
I just worry that this feeling

14:45.768 --> 14:49.137
Won't last as long
as a half million dollars.

14:49.171 --> 14:50.272
Here.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.741
I got a truffle to catch.

14:52.775 --> 14:56.578
Yeoowww!

15:01.784 --> 15:03.485
This is speedy.

15:03.519 --> 15:04.652
Speedy, listen to me.

15:04.687 --> 15:06.087
Gossamer went inside
your mouse hole.

15:06.122 --> 15:07.522
You've got to come home
and get him out.

15:07.557 --> 15:11.059
- Wait a second. How could
Gossamer get in there? He's giant!

15:11.094 --> 15:12.628
Lola turned him into a frog.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.998
- Ok. Something I don't
appreciate is practical jokes.

15:16.033 --> 15:17.534
The kind of people
that like pulling pranks

15:17.568 --> 15:19.336
Has something seriously
wrong with them.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.739
I'm at work!
Get help, man.

15:22.773 --> 15:25.742
- No, no, no, no!
He hung up.

15:25.776 --> 15:28.144
Now what are we going to do?

15:28.178 --> 15:30.546
Hmm.

15:32.916 --> 15:36.051
you don't
believe me, do you?

15:36.086 --> 15:38.720
Oh, no, we believe you.

15:38.755 --> 15:43.158
- So, um, Gossamer's
in here, you say?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.995
What is it? What's wrong?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.163
Just, um, give us a moment.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.566
We'll fix everything.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.568
Oh, where do we begin?!

15:54.603 --> 15:56.737
Well, for starters,

15:56.772 --> 15:59.039
Why is all the furniture
crammed against the walls?

15:59.074 --> 16:00.708
There's no flow,
there's no balance.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.977
One never places two large pieces
of furniture side by side!

16:04.012 --> 16:06.313
- And, if you're going
to have an area rug,

16:06.347 --> 16:07.781
It needs to be anchored
by something.

16:07.815 --> 16:10.184
It's just floating
in the middle of the room!

16:10.218 --> 16:14.354
- Let's stop talking
and start decorating!

16:16.491 --> 16:18.559
- We did it.
- Where's Gossamer?

16:18.593 --> 16:21.328
- Who is Gossamer?
- The frog!

16:21.362 --> 16:23.563
- Oh. There wasn't
a frog in there.

16:23.598 --> 16:25.932
But the back door was open.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.801
Back door?!

16:29.404 --> 16:30.704
He could be anywhere!

16:34.976 --> 16:38.279
Oh, boy. That's our neighbor.

17:06.374 --> 17:08.407
Oh, boy.

17:08.443 --> 17:10.944
How's the convention?

17:10.979 --> 17:12.212
Dull as usual.

17:12.247 --> 17:14.080
I'm calling
to check on Gossamer.

17:14.115 --> 17:15.449
He giving you any trouble?

17:15.483 --> 17:16.951
no... Not really.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.856
- I may have accidentally
turned Gossamer into a frog

17:21.890 --> 17:23.891
And have no idea
of how to turn him back,

17:23.925 --> 17:26.926
But guess who just saved him
from getting eaten

17:26.962 --> 17:29.798
By a tasmanian devil? Ahh!

17:29.832 --> 17:30.899
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

17:30.933 --> 17:32.768
Where's the spell book?

17:39.242 --> 17:40.543
Wait a second.

17:40.577 --> 17:42.411
The alarm clock was the frog?

17:42.446 --> 17:45.014
We should have been
chasing the bear!

17:45.049 --> 17:47.984
What are you so mad about?
You're back to normal.

17:48.019 --> 17:49.252
What?

17:49.287 --> 17:51.621
Oh, uh, nothing.

17:54.892 --> 17:57.928
My truffle!

18:01.333 --> 18:04.535
This ends now.

18:07.940 --> 18:09.707
Mother!

18:09.741 --> 18:11.008
You're not understanding me.

18:11.043 --> 18:13.244
It's not just a bear,
it's a little boy!

18:13.278 --> 18:15.446
Well, actually,
he's a big orange monster,

18:15.480 --> 18:17.481
But he's a boy
that looks like a monster

18:17.516 --> 18:19.783
That's trapped in a bear's body.

18:19.817 --> 18:22.219
I'll just hang up on myself.

18:22.253 --> 18:23.353
Daffy's in trouble!

18:23.388 --> 18:26.723
- I don't have time to worry
about Daffy right now.

18:26.758 --> 18:27.691
Just listen!

18:27.725 --> 18:30.026
Daffy blindfolded me
and took me into the woods

18:30.060 --> 18:32.095
Because he thought
since I was a pig,

18:32.129 --> 18:33.563
I would be able
to find him a truffle.

18:33.597 --> 18:35.731
But then he got lost
and a bear chased us

18:35.765 --> 18:37.432
And I almost
went over a waterfall!

18:37.467 --> 18:38.801
But Daffy saved me--
- Porky.

18:38.835 --> 18:41.403
- But then
he jumped over the waterfall!

18:41.437 --> 18:43.638
- Oh, man,
I wanted to do it.

18:43.673 --> 18:45.207
Did you say a bear?

18:45.241 --> 18:46.641
Yes. There hasn't been

18:46.675 --> 18:49.077
A bear in those woods
for a thousand years!

18:49.111 --> 18:52.813
- That's because that bear
is Gossamer!

18:52.848 --> 18:56.116
Gossamer?

19:00.955 --> 19:02.456
You killed him?!

19:02.490 --> 19:04.925
What, this?

19:04.959 --> 19:06.426
No, this is synthetic.

19:06.461 --> 19:08.863
I bought it at the park
gift shop on the way out.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.765
Here. I got you a keychain.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.268
Daffy, where's the bear?

19:15.303 --> 19:18.272
- Oh, uh,
he's on the front porch.

19:18.306 --> 19:21.175
I bet he's an escaped
circus bear or something.

19:21.210 --> 19:22.377
He's completely harmless.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.312
He's the one who led me
out of the woods.

19:24.346 --> 19:26.214
I'm thinking about keeping him.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.617
Making him
my personal assistant.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.356
Gossamer!

19:33.390 --> 19:35.658
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine!

19:35.693 --> 19:37.294
I mean, I was scared at first,

19:37.328 --> 19:39.863
But then I found
Mr. Pig and Mr. Duck,

19:39.897 --> 19:41.064
And I knew I was safe.

19:41.098 --> 19:45.269
- Well, it's getting late.
Why don't we get you home.

19:45.303 --> 19:48.939
- If you want, I can
read you a bedtime story.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.244
Mmm, mmm.

19:54.278 --> 19:57.480
- It is so good to be back
in civilization.

19:57.514 --> 19:59.682
Hey, speedy.

19:59.716 --> 20:01.951
How about some more
cinnamon breadsticks?

20:01.985 --> 20:03.419
How can you afford all this?

20:03.453 --> 20:05.554
- Oh, oh, oh.
We can afford it.

20:05.588 --> 20:06.621
What are you talking about?

20:06.656 --> 20:09.123
- How much do you think
this baby's worth?

20:09.158 --> 20:11.192
- I don't know,
it's pretty big.

20:11.227 --> 20:12.760
A dime, maybe?

20:12.795 --> 20:16.397
- A dime?!
For a truffle this size?

20:16.431 --> 20:18.032
That's not a truffle!

20:18.066 --> 20:20.234
That's an old, dirty potato!

20:20.269 --> 20:21.436
You thought it was a truffle?

20:21.470 --> 20:24.806
They only got those
in Italy and France, man.

20:36.852 --> 20:39.421
There goes my self worth.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.990
You still have me.

20:42.592 --> 20:44.660
You feel like taking a trip

20:44.694 --> 20:46.662
To Italy or France?

20:46.696 --> 20:49.064
It would be MP.

20:49.098 --> 20:51.433
- That means you're paying,
you know.

20:51.468 --> 20:53.903
I know.

20:59.343 --> 21:02.713
What the...?

21:04.315 --> 21:07.818
Am I on some kind
of reality show?

21:07.852 --> 21:10.987
Hello?
