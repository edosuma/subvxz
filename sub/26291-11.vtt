WEBVTT

00:03.568 --> 00:04.526
It's great. I wish you...

00:06.484 --> 00:07.529
MAN:
Pay attention.

00:07.572 --> 00:09.226
These people owe their lives

00:09.270 --> 00:10.619
or deaths to you.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.882
Just so I'm clear,
are you killing me,

00:12.925 --> 00:13.883
or are you breaking me out?

00:13.926 --> 00:15.363
What is Apollyon?

00:15.406 --> 00:16.581
A private intelligence firm.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.627
All former intelligence
and special forces.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.107
Now, please, let's go.No.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.195
You have something
that they want.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.892
Proof they exist.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.807
Scan the bar code,
files download.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.506
No!

00:30.682 --> 00:31.770
Dad.

00:31.814 --> 00:34.382
As I am now,
so soon you'll be.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.644
Prepare for death,

00:35.687 --> 00:36.775
and follow me.

01:07.371 --> 01:10.331
PRIDE:
Cassius, hold on, okay?

01:10.374 --> 01:12.115
Dad!

01:20.906 --> 01:23.344
Hey. Why...?

01:23.387 --> 01:25.694
What more do you want from me?

01:25.737 --> 01:27.217
Excuse me?

01:29.219 --> 01:30.220
Sorry.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.064
Dwayne.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.240
You okay, Loretta?

01:50.284 --> 01:51.589
Tired.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.766
But no worse for wear.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.421
Due in no small part
to you and...

01:59.162 --> 02:00.642
...Cassius.
I'm so sorry.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.687
Yeah.

02:02.731 --> 02:05.516
I'll spare you my
two cents on coping.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.866
Thank you.

02:07.910 --> 02:11.218
But it's worse
to grieve alone.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.220
Tell you what.

02:13.263 --> 02:15.265
You promise to take it easy
and get some rest,

02:15.309 --> 02:18.312
soon as I'm ready to talk,
we'll do it over a glass

02:18.355 --> 02:20.314
of Eagle Rare at the Trutone.

02:20.357 --> 02:22.229
Make it a 20-year
Pappy Van Winkle

02:22.272 --> 02:24.187
and you got a deal.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.327
Tell me you
got something.Nothing that's worth a lick.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.285
Apollyon is extremely good
at covering their tracks.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.983
Whoever was giving Pride orders
could be doing it from anywhere.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.202
Maybe the snipers
we arrested

02:39.246 --> 02:40.725
can lead us in the
right direction.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.815
CIA big-footed us out of
asking many questions for now.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.034
We still have the dead suspects;

02:45.077 --> 02:46.209
maybe we can get something
off of them.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.384
Don't hold your breath.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.212
So far, the mobile biometrics

02:49.256 --> 02:51.562
have only come back
with more scrubbed aliases.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.782
And their weapons?Manufactured
without serial numbers

02:53.825 --> 02:55.087
and untraceable.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.741
So, we have no leads,
no evidence,

02:56.785 --> 02:59.701
and absolutely no idea
who we're searching for?

02:59.744 --> 03:02.182
Well, when you put it that way,
it makes you want to give up.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.053
Who's giving up,
Gregorio?

03:05.359 --> 03:06.751
Hey, King.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.666
About Cassius...

03:08.710 --> 03:10.146
It's okay, Christopher.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.974
No, it's not.
Please.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.584
Let me speak.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.978
What they did to you

03:16.021 --> 03:18.459
and Miss Loretta
and Cassius,

03:18.502 --> 03:21.331
it's like they did it to
each and every one of us.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.854
And whoever it
is that's behind

03:22.898 --> 03:24.465
the voice that's
still out there,

03:24.508 --> 03:26.293
we're gonna take 'em down.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.642
Together.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.821
What have we learned?

03:32.864 --> 03:34.301
We know we need
to move fast

03:34.344 --> 03:35.824
before Apollyon
gets to ground.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.739
They're not going anywhere.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.437
Not as long as we have

03:40.481 --> 03:42.309
the one thing
that they want the most.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.180
What's that?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.660
Amelia's got a dossier on them.

03:45.703 --> 03:48.663
A bar code tattooed
on her stomach.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.448
I like that bitch so much more
now that she's dead.

03:51.492 --> 03:52.841
Whatever's on that file,

03:52.884 --> 03:55.278
Apollyon's afraid
of it getting out there.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.237
Could lead us right
to their doorstep.HANNAH: Sebastian.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.065
You and Lasalle escort
Amelia's body to the morgue.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.241
Have REACT back you up
just in case.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.764
Do not let her out of your sight

04:02.807 --> 04:04.853
till you decode
that tattoo.I'll keep looking

04:04.896 --> 04:06.202
for fingerprints.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.421
I'm suddenly
feeling lucky.

04:07.464 --> 04:10.815
We got this, King, we're
gonna make it right.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.130

04:39.888 --> 04:42.499
What the hell, Dwayne? I've
been locked up here for hours.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.284
For your own protection.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.415
Protection from what?

04:45.459 --> 04:47.461
You need to tell me
what's going on.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.855
You hurt?
No.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.117
Well, who's blood is that?

04:52.161 --> 04:53.945
Cassius.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.425
He's dead.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.867
That son of a bitch had it
made in the shade with WITSEC.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.566
All he had to do was
keep his head down.

05:07.219 --> 05:09.047
How'd he screw up this time?

05:09.091 --> 05:11.223
He didn't.Well, then, how...?

05:11.267 --> 05:13.878
Someone came after me,
used Cassius as leverage.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.576
I did everything I could...

05:15.619 --> 05:18.100
Yeah, everything
but keep him alive.Jimmy,

05:18.143 --> 05:19.275
I didn't see this coming.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.668
See,

05:20.711 --> 05:23.061
the messed up thing, though,
is, I did.

05:23.105 --> 05:26.935
: Being around you is
more dangerous than drugs.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.112
Wow.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.593
I don't know
what to say.Ain't nothing tosay.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.467
Just some hard truth.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.601
Jimmy?

05:40.644 --> 05:42.733
The people responsible
are still out there.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.256
'Till we catch 'em,
safest place

05:44.300 --> 05:46.781
for you to be is
right here at NCIS.

05:46.824 --> 05:50.175
Now, all due respect,
I'm not so sure about that.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.536
Eight rounds to the body.

06:02.579 --> 06:06.017
Pride had
to neutralize the threat.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.671
I don't blame him.Hell, me neither, but

06:07.715 --> 06:10.152
I kind of wish he focused a
little less on center mass.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.719
This tattoo's so
damaged, I don't know

06:11.762 --> 06:13.721
if I'm gonna be able to
retrieve any of the data.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.984
Sorry I'm late, boys.

06:16.027 --> 06:19.466
Doc Wade,
what are you doing here?

06:19.509 --> 06:20.902
Same thing you
are, Christopher,

06:20.945 --> 06:22.338
I'm working on the case.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.340
Well, we heard
you were taking a break.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.690
It's a misunderstanding,
I'm sure.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.432
Slide over so I can
take a look.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.347
Yeah.

06:32.870 --> 06:36.004
Appears to be severe trauma
to the epidermis.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.484
Might be decipherable ink

06:37.527 --> 06:39.224
deeper in the dermis layer.Mm.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.836
Excuse me, Doctor.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.490
Where would you like this one?

06:43.533 --> 06:45.013
This one has a name.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.580
He's Cassius Pride.

06:46.623 --> 06:49.321
And you should make him
more comfortable over there.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.977
I-I... I got you, bud.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.464
I can't imagine
losing my dad.

07:01.508 --> 07:04.032
Better live forever.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.470
Chris, I'm sorry.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.431
Well, dying's a part of life,
Sebastian.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.476
Not like this, it isn't.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.174
There's nothing we
can do about Cassius

07:16.218 --> 07:17.872
except finding justice for him.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.613
That's the next best step.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.571
And what if we can't
find Apollyon?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.704
That's not an option.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.410
Are they here?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.890
Yes, sir.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.326
Daddy.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.849
Hi.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.071
Oh, Dwayne.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.551
PRIDE:
Figured you and Laurel

07:44.594 --> 07:47.031
would be more comfortable
in the apartment.

07:49.033 --> 07:52.123
And I stocked the refrigerator.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.822
And the marshals will be right
outside if you need anything.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.301
And I put some towels

07:56.345 --> 07:58.434
and extra...
We'll be fine.

08:01.306 --> 08:04.135
Rita, I... I know I've put
you through hell lately.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.748
Hey, I knew exactly what I was
signing up for, Dwayne.

08:07.791 --> 08:12.404
But you never wish that things
were a bit more... predictable?

08:12.448 --> 08:14.537
Well, predictable is boring.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.192
And boring is one thing
you are not.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.806
Go talk to her.
I'll get settled.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.334
This nightmare is
almost over, sweetie.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.467
You don't have to worry.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.513
I'm not worried, Dad.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.472
I'm sad.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.779
About Cassius?

08:38.822 --> 08:40.955
Of course.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.959
Did you know that he painted?

08:45.002 --> 08:47.352
Landscapes mostly.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.919
He wasn't very good at it.

08:48.963 --> 08:52.314
All the trees ended up looking
like green marshmallows,

08:52.357 --> 08:53.620
but he loved it.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.796
Points for trying.

08:55.839 --> 08:59.582
He taught other inmates
how to read, too.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.150
He grew vegetables
in the prison garden.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.500
He always had a green thumb.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.154
Yeah.

09:06.197 --> 09:10.071
Did you know his favorite
shortstop was Ernie Banks?

09:10.114 --> 09:12.682
That one I did know.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.032
Met him once when
he was a teenager.

09:15.076 --> 09:18.558
And Cassius couldn't stop
smiling for a month.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.256
I had no idea
he told you all that.

09:21.299 --> 09:24.825
'Cause we never really
talked about him.

09:24.868 --> 09:28.263
Well...

09:28.306 --> 09:30.744
we need to
change that.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.142
I'm really gonna miss him.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.188
Yeah. I know, baby.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.798
Dwayne?

09:41.842 --> 09:43.234
Work's calling.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.584
I'll call 'em back.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.107
LAUREL:
No, Daddy,

09:46.150 --> 09:48.413
it could be important.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.636
LASALLE:
King, we caught

09:53.680 --> 09:55.551
our first break.Yeah, the surface

09:55.595 --> 09:57.988
of Amelia's tattoo was
compromised in the shooting.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.773
GREGORIO:
But Wade found decipherable

09:59.816 --> 10:01.775
ink patterns in the
subcutaneous layer.Yeah.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.168
We didn't have enough detail
to salvage everything.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.561
But I was able to retrieve

10:05.605 --> 10:06.954
a small chunk
of the embedded data.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.001
Surveillance photos?Mm-hmm. Time and date from 2010.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.656
All taken in the Simón Bolívar
Airport in Caracas.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.484
And featuring
the same four people.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.051
HANNAH:
We're guessing
they're all past

10:17.094 --> 10:18.313
or present Apollyon operatives.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.489
May even be the voice himself.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.099
All we got to do is ID them.GREGORIO:
Easier said

10:22.143 --> 10:23.623
than done. We all know
how good Apollyon is

10:23.666 --> 10:27.061
at burying their employees'
real identities.

10:27.104 --> 10:29.237
Can you isolate the man
on the far left?

10:32.327 --> 10:35.069
Imagine him
with short hair,

10:35.112 --> 10:36.897
no beard.

10:36.940 --> 10:40.161
Who do you see?

10:40.204 --> 10:42.772
Well, hell.

10:42.816 --> 10:43.817
What, you know him?

10:43.860 --> 10:45.993
We all do.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.702
Walker.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.619
What took you so long?

11:14.543 --> 11:17.851
Always nice
to see old friends.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.854
You're gonna tell us everything
you know about Apollyon.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.030
Skip the foreplay, go right
to the good stuff, huh?

11:23.073 --> 11:26.860
Now, what if I was to tell you
that I have no idea

11:26.903 --> 11:28.165
what you guys are talking about?

11:28.209 --> 11:29.384
You'd be lying.

11:31.429 --> 11:32.735
Where'd you get those?

11:32.779 --> 11:34.041
Amelia Parsons.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.912
She always was impulsive.
How is she, anyway?

11:35.956 --> 11:37.871
She's dead.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.611
Limited shelf life in our
line of work, I'm afraid,

11:39.655 --> 11:40.830
especially when you
piss off the boss.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.745
Who is the boss?I don't know.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.616
Never met him in person.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.706
How'd you communicate?Secure voice lines.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.926
Compensation delivered
electronically.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.059
Untraceable and everything
on a need-to-know basis.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.017
Just one man
doling out assignments

11:54.061 --> 11:55.453
from behind a magic curtain.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.978
What kind of assignments?

11:58.021 --> 12:01.285
Intel grabs, HVT assassinations,
you know the drill,

12:01.329 --> 12:02.809
or maybe you don't

12:02.852 --> 12:05.159
because you're here
talking to me.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.117
You're never getting
out of prison, Walker,

12:07.161 --> 12:09.641
but if you help us
find your boss,

12:09.685 --> 12:11.556
we'll help you
negotiate privileges.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.862
Privileges?
Mm-hmm.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.472
You gonna give me, uh,
some extra yard time?

12:14.516 --> 12:16.518
Double serving
at chow?

12:16.561 --> 12:21.001
You guys don't get it.
You're chasing a ghost.

12:21.044 --> 12:24.700
Somebody's gonna lead us to him,
maybe one of them.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.485
I want names.

12:27.529 --> 12:30.750
Well, I only know aliases
and their countries,

12:30.793 --> 12:31.968
but I'm telling you

12:32.012 --> 12:33.970
you're wasting
your time.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.189
How's that?

12:35.232 --> 12:38.975
Apollyon's outer ring
has been breached.

12:39.019 --> 12:42.326
Boss's only play is to go
into a scorched earth protocol.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.328
He's gonna be tying up
loose ends.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.765
You're saying he's going
after his own people?

12:45.808 --> 12:47.984
Yeah, if he hasn't already.

12:48.028 --> 12:51.509
Give us the aliases.

12:51.553 --> 12:55.252
Will do, just as soon you get

12:55.296 --> 12:58.168
this handsome loose end
into protective custody.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.042
Quid pro quo, Agent Pride.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.092
It's too quiet around here.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.398
I don't like it.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.616
Ms. Rita.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.183
It's independent study time.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.490
Yeah, we're trying to find three

13:15.533 --> 13:18.101
very elusive needles
in a global haystack.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.712
And all we have to go on are
some, uh, make-believe names.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.192
Anything I can do?

13:22.236 --> 13:24.020
PRIDE: You can tell me how you
convinced the marshals

13:24.064 --> 13:26.414
to let you out of my apartment.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.111
Sir, uh, I can explain.

13:28.155 --> 13:31.114
Relax, Dwayne. Deputy Bannon
is keeping me safe and sound,

13:31.158 --> 13:32.681
and I didn't give him a choice.

13:32.724 --> 13:37.120
He also carried a very large
takeout order from Emeril's.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.948
Oh, you got that
barbecue shrimp?

13:38.992 --> 13:41.646
Three orders and extra biscuits.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.126
I totally get why
you love that woman.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.911
RITA:
Dwayne.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.651
Help in the kitchen.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.393
I got it.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.270
Dinner was
a very sweet gesture.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.750
Well, someone has to feed you.

13:58.794 --> 14:02.580
Sure that's the only reason
you're here? 'Cause I'm fine.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.321
I'm glad, Dwayne.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.890
How's Laurel?

14:07.934 --> 14:10.023
Stressed out, but I convinced
her to take a nap.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.241
And don't worry,

14:11.285 --> 14:12.895
the other marshal
is keeping an eye.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.375
She's not the only one
with stress.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.594
Seems like everyone around here
is walking on eggshells,

14:16.638 --> 14:17.813
waiting for me

14:17.857 --> 14:19.249
to fall apart or explode,

14:19.293 --> 14:22.252
but that's,
that's not what I feel.

14:22.296 --> 14:25.081
Well, what do you feel?

14:25.125 --> 14:28.215
Nothing.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.782
Cassius was a bad man
and a worse father.

14:30.826 --> 14:33.829
And that's the best
I can say about him.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.787
I suffered enough
when he was alive.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.398
His death should be a relief.

14:37.441 --> 14:40.227
Well, it should be,
but he saved your life.

14:40.270 --> 14:43.143
For that, I should forgive
a lifetime of bad behavior?

14:43.186 --> 14:45.580
No, he doesn't deserve it.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.104
He's gone, Dwayne. It doesn't
matter what he deserves anymore.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.279
Yeah, well,

14:49.323 --> 14:51.673
I would just like to move on.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.285
Sorry to interrupt.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.939
Just got a call from the morgue.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.680
Jimmy showed up,

14:58.723 --> 15:00.769
there's a problem.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.466
Yeah.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.338
Hello.MAN: Mr. Pride...

15:04.381 --> 15:07.558
Spasibo, Vasily. Sorry, just hang on.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.734
My contact in Moscow
says the operative Walker

15:09.778 --> 15:11.562
identified as Idris

15:11.606 --> 15:13.521
was found floating

15:13.564 --> 15:15.915
in the Moskva River
this morning. Throat cut.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.481
Apollyon?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.570
Yeah, well, they got to
the one called Elisha, too.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.616
Mossad just found
her body in an apartment

15:21.659 --> 15:23.139
outside of Tel Aviv.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.401
That leaves
only Matias.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.707
GREGORIO: Walker said
he's a Colombian expat,

15:25.750 --> 15:28.318
but the NID claims to have
no knowledge of him.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.146
Matias knows there's
a target on his back,

15:30.190 --> 15:31.887
he could be anywhere
in the world.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.541
So where do we start?

15:33.584 --> 15:35.238
Texas. Facial recognition.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.327
I got a recent hit
on a Highway Patrol mug shot.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.199
GREGORIO:
They collared him for a DUI

15:39.242 --> 15:41.462
under the name Carl Chambers.

15:41.505 --> 15:44.291
Address is in an unincorporated
area of Marion County.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.857
Well, that's not
the middle of nowhere,

15:45.901 --> 15:47.033
but you can see it from there.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.773
If we can track him there,
so can Apollyon.

15:48.817 --> 15:52.255
I'll make a call, see if we can
piggyback a flight to Texas.

15:52.299 --> 15:53.996
I'll call DPS,
have them set up

15:54.040 --> 15:55.955
support and surveillance
while we're in the air.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.000
What about Jimmy?I can go to the morgue.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.654
No. I need the three of you

15:59.697 --> 16:00.742
to deep-dive Matias.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.526
We need leverage
to get him talking.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.272
I'll handle Jimmy.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.360
You sure?

16:10.404 --> 16:12.710
Yeah.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.451
Hannah, you and Chris,
you got to be careful.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.888
Apollyon's capable of anything.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.194
JIMMY:
I'm not going anywhere.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.109
I got a right to be here
and to see my father.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.198
Dwayne, tell this idiot
who I am.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.852
Whoa, Jimmy,
what's going on?

16:23.895 --> 16:26.724
I just... I need to see Pop.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.163
And this steaming pile
won't let me

16:30.206 --> 16:31.991
without some BS piece of paper.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.210
Proof of kinship
is a standard requirement.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.995
But if he doesn't
calm down now...

16:36.038 --> 16:37.866
All right,
it's okay, Hank.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.563
I'll take it
from here.

16:39.607 --> 16:40.608
Sorry for the confusion.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.267
Come on.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.249
Mrs. Applebaum's
third grade class.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.946
Assignment was to bring in
our birth certificates

17:14.990 --> 17:17.645
for a special project.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.997
I was the only kid
with a blank space for a dad.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.609
Doctor's appointments,

17:25.653 --> 17:28.656
winning touchdowns,

17:28.699 --> 17:30.614
high school graduation,

17:30.658 --> 17:33.574
my first arrest.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.622
Pop missed it all.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.190
Wish I could tell you my
formative years were different.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.801
Yeah, but at least people knew
who your old man was.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.456
Was bona fide,

17:46.500 --> 17:50.025
not some dirty little
backroom secret.

17:52.027 --> 17:55.030
Here I am, a grown-ass man,

17:55.074 --> 17:57.337
I'm still the bastard.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.078
Not to me.

18:01.558 --> 18:05.214
Look, Jimmy, I can't
change the past,

18:05.258 --> 18:08.174
but even if I could,

18:08.217 --> 18:12.961
I wouldn't.

18:13.004 --> 18:16.356
He made a lot
of mistakes,

18:16.399 --> 18:19.924
but giving me
a brother...

18:19.968 --> 18:21.578
was the one thing
he got right.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.149
We may not have
the same last name,

18:27.193 --> 18:28.803
but we got
the same blood.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.112
We're brothers.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.898
Don't need some piece of
paper to make it official.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.421
It just is.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.946
You promise?

18:41.990 --> 18:44.166
Promise.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.572
Special Agent Khoury,
Special Agent Lasalle,

18:58.615 --> 19:00.182
welcome to Texas.What's our sitrep?

19:00.226 --> 19:01.575
SWAT team has eyes
on the target

19:01.618 --> 19:02.880
and is holding
the ranch perimeter.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.055
Any sign of Apollyon?

19:04.099 --> 19:05.535
No, sir.
We're still
in the game.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.710
I got a federal arrest warrant

19:06.754 --> 19:08.538
for Matias on suspicion
of espionage,

19:08.582 --> 19:10.061
but we still expect resistance.

19:10.105 --> 19:13.413
Our team in New Orleans
has intel that our suspect

19:13.456 --> 19:15.066
is a trained assassin

19:15.110 --> 19:16.198
and extremely
dangerous.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.591
It is mission critical

19:17.634 --> 19:19.070
that Matias is taken
into custody unharmed.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.116
Walk in the park.

19:43.834 --> 19:44.922
LASALLE:
Federal agents!

19:44.966 --> 19:46.576
Don't move!Hands up, Matias!

19:48.143 --> 19:52.060
Uh, my name is Carl Chambers.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.540
Yeah, it's also
Lawrence Boden,

19:53.583 --> 19:56.064
Paulo Grimes,
Javier Zapata.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.239
They're all aliases you used

19:57.283 --> 19:58.936
while working as
an Apollyon hit man.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.374
Y-Y-You got it all wrong, ma'am.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.246
I-I'm just a mechanic
from Lubbock.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.465
Hands on your head.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.907
Like I said,

20:12.950 --> 20:13.995
walk in the park.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.173
LASALLE:
We've got a sniper.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.174
Come on.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.045
Everybody take cover.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.269
HANNAH:
Is she okay?

20:27.313 --> 20:28.749
LASALLE:
She's got a pulse.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.664
Somebody really
hates mechanics.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.105
I see him.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.153
Sniper's on the north side
of the stable.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.199
RANGER :
Copy. We're on the move.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.639
I can give you Apollyon.
I can take you to the boss.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.641
Just get me
the hell out of here.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.210
Take cover!

20:55.254 --> 20:56.733
RANGER 2:
Drop it and show us your hands!

21:00.346 --> 21:04.045
Sniper is down.
Target is neutralized.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.396
Matias.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.226
Matias.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.101
He's dead.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.203
Thanks.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.118
I just got
off the phone with DPS.

21:34.162 --> 21:37.383
Lieutenant Brown lost a lot of
blood, but she'll pull through.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.254
What about the sniper?

21:39.298 --> 21:41.648
Another scrubbed identity.
Another dead end.Damn it.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.780
I'm sorry, Pride.
Matias was our last chance

21:43.824 --> 21:46.261
at flushing out
the Apollyon boss.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.263
Yeah, well, the outcome
would have been the same

21:48.307 --> 21:49.960
even if I was there.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.919
What's our next move?

21:54.487 --> 21:57.446
Don't know if we have one.

21:57.490 --> 22:01.450
All we can do is wait and hope
that they make a mistake.

22:01.494 --> 22:05.019
Since when do you
throw in the towel?

22:06.673 --> 22:09.458
I'm certainly open
to suggestions.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.591
Okay, um...

22:11.634 --> 22:13.593
I didn't want to have to do
this, but considering

22:13.636 --> 22:17.336
the circumstances, I think
I know someone who can help.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.641
RYAN:
Military might,

22:18.685 --> 22:22.471
financial prowess,
political clout--

22:22.515 --> 22:26.345
these are all critical measures
of a nation.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.172
Balancing these factors
amongst sovereign states

22:28.216 --> 22:29.783
is the key to preventing
any one entity

22:29.826 --> 22:31.393
from becoming too powerful.

22:31.437 --> 22:35.354
So how do we maintain
this delicate equilibrium?

22:35.397 --> 22:37.791
With a little help
from our friends.

22:37.834 --> 22:41.011
Combined infrastructure,
shared intelligence,

22:41.055 --> 22:45.276
and a common goal
to prevent any one entity

22:45.320 --> 22:47.278
from becoming a giant
international pain in the ass.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.848
All right, folks.
That is all for today.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.589
Uh, remember, thesis proposals

22:53.633 --> 22:55.548
due next Friday.
No exceptions.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.685
Hannah.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.731
Hi.

23:04.774 --> 23:07.386
Uh, SAC Dwayne Pride,

23:07.429 --> 23:09.126
please meet
Professor Ryan Porter...

23:09.170 --> 23:11.564
Hey....my ex-husband.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.087
Separated, actually.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.393
Hannah's never

23:14.436 --> 23:15.437
been big on details.

23:17.657 --> 23:18.788
How long you been in town?

23:18.832 --> 23:20.094
September.

23:20.137 --> 23:23.880
Four months,
and you don't say a word?

23:23.924 --> 23:25.316
What the hell, Hannah?

23:25.360 --> 23:26.927
Look, I know that we have
a lot to talk about,

23:26.970 --> 23:28.581
but it's gonna have to wait.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.974
We need your help.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.586
Special Agent Pride needs it.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.546
What can I do for you?PRIDE:
Hannah said

23:37.590 --> 23:38.982
you're well connected
at the NSA.

23:39.026 --> 23:42.638
You consulted on SIGINT,
COMSEC projects?

23:42.682 --> 23:44.901
Only as it relates
to foreign policy.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.903
I'm an academic, not a spy.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.731
Have you ever heard of Apollyon?

23:48.775 --> 23:50.167
Heard of it, sure.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.039
Boogeyman
of the intel community.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.476
Seen proof it really exists? No.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.304
Well, we can show you
at least a dozen body bags

23:56.347 --> 23:58.262
filled with proof.

23:58.306 --> 24:01.091
They're extremely dangerous,
and we're running out of leads.

24:01.135 --> 24:04.530
Well, if it's real,
Apollyon's survived this long

24:04.573 --> 24:06.488
by hiding in the shadows.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.750
We're hoping you can
introduce us to someone

24:07.794 --> 24:10.187
whose job it is
to see in the dark.

24:10.231 --> 24:11.537
You must have
your own connections.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.060
Mired in red tape
and bureaucracy.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.366
We need a faster,
more direct route.

24:15.410 --> 24:18.674
Got a friend at Fort Meade,
owes me a favor.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.241
Senior intel analyst.

24:20.284 --> 24:24.158
I'll, uh, see what I can do.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.508
Your ex, huh?

24:26.552 --> 24:29.293
Kind of buried the lede.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.339
It's a bit of a sore topic.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.822
My last long-term
post was overseas.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.259
Ryan and my daughter
Naomi were with me,

24:38.302 --> 24:41.828
until a radical group made
an attempt on my life,

24:41.871 --> 24:44.265
nearly killed them
in the process.

24:44.308 --> 24:47.007
You moved them to New Orleans
to keep 'em safe.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.139
Yeah, it was just supposed
to be for a few weeks, but...

24:49.183 --> 24:51.141
you know, until we
neutralized the threat,

24:51.185 --> 24:52.534
but that took longer
than I thought.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.101
Weeks turned
into months,

24:54.144 --> 24:57.844
and I haven't seen them
in a year and a half.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.977
That's why you accepted
the transfer. To reconnect.

25:01.021 --> 25:04.198
Seemed like a good idea
at the time, but...

25:04.241 --> 25:07.767
I haven't been able
to bring myself to see 'em yet.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.551
Why not?

25:09.595 --> 25:12.293
I honestly have no idea.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.295
You're in luck, Agent Pride.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.862
My friend will talk to you.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.646
Details will be sent
through your SCIF.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.169
Thank you.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.215
Thank you,
we appreciate it.

25:21.258 --> 25:23.260
I'll wait outside.Okay, yeah.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.180
I know I've got a lot
of explaining to do.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.486
But you got to go.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.183
Yeah.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.403
Save your explanations
for Naomi.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.448
Your daughter misses you.

26:00.994 --> 26:04.345
My apologizes for all the cloak
and dagger, Agent Pride. S.O.P.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.781
Understood.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.610
I appreciate your assistance,
Ms. Cooper.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.873
Ryan Porter's a trusted
colleague, but final approval

26:10.917 --> 26:13.397
came from
the NSA director himself.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.791
Seems you have big fans
in high places.

26:15.835 --> 26:19.099
Now, if you'll please follow me.
It's only a short walk.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.677
And remember, everything
you're about to see

26:31.720 --> 26:33.243
and hear is classified.

26:35.985 --> 26:39.510
This outpost employs
40 full-time analysts

26:39.554 --> 26:43.079
who scrutinize and disseminate
a never-ending 24/7 stream

26:43.123 --> 26:46.300
of signal intelligence gathered
domestically and abroad.

26:46.343 --> 26:47.518
Big Brother really
is watching.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.085
This unit's focus
is the tracking

26:49.129 --> 26:50.913
of private intelligence firms.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.350
Sanctioned ones
like Aegis and Black Cube,

26:53.394 --> 26:55.439
as well as
more subversive operators.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.224
Like Apollyon.The primary subject

26:57.267 --> 26:58.921
of analyst Philip Sinclair,

26:58.965 --> 27:00.662
since they first surfaced
eight years ago.

27:00.706 --> 27:03.665
Apollyon, the Destroyer,

27:03.709 --> 27:07.626
appears in the Book of
Revelation as a spiritual being

27:07.669 --> 27:10.237
from the
bottomless abyss.The Angel of Death.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.935
Or the Devil himself.The organization
you're chasing applies

27:12.979 --> 27:14.067
their own brand
of disruption.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.721
They do much more
than gather intel.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.244
They actively exploit it.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.637
Murder, rigged elections,

27:18.680 --> 27:19.899
manipulation
of financial markets.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.249
Yeah, on whose behalf?

27:22.292 --> 27:23.946
The highest bidder, of course.

27:23.990 --> 27:27.210
Dictators, third world regimes,
and global conglomerates.

27:27.254 --> 27:30.605
And the whole operation
is controlled by one person?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.563
So far as we know, yes,
but after years

27:32.607 --> 27:36.306
of intercepted communications
and human intel, we still...

27:37.699 --> 27:39.875
...we don't have
any idea who that is.

27:39.919 --> 27:42.486
Then how do we find him?

27:42.530 --> 27:45.489
Operational strategy's
a-above my pay grade.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.361
Thank you, Philip.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.799
Director has authorized us
to share

27:50.843 --> 27:52.496
everything we have
on Apollyon.

27:52.540 --> 27:56.196
He welcomes any assistance
you and your team can offer.

27:56.239 --> 27:59.721
So we got
over 3,000 NSA intercepts,

27:59.765 --> 28:01.331
all with Apollyon mentions.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.725
They suggest at least
two dozen covert operations.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.335
Yeah, the problem is that
all the details are obfuscated

28:05.379 --> 28:08.991
by, uh, code names,
numerical aliases, cryptonyms.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.079
It's like trying to solve
a jigsaw puzzle

28:10.123 --> 28:11.994
with half the pieces missing.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.518
There's got to be something
in all these files we can use.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.259
I've been running association
algorithms. Might be able

28:16.303 --> 28:17.608
to find the common link
hidden in the data.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.610
Yeah, I don't know.
It seems too easy.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.612
That's the only move
I've come up with so far.

28:21.656 --> 28:25.355
Oh, hold up.
Got something.

28:25.399 --> 28:29.055
Looks like a recurring reference
to someone code-named Eagle?

28:29.098 --> 28:31.187
Only person involved in every
single Apollyon mission.

28:31.231 --> 28:32.711
Yeah, including
the forced coercion

28:32.754 --> 28:34.887
of an NCIS special agent
in charge.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.758
This intercept
is three days old.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.542
Yeah, it's marked with
an origin tag on its hip.

28:38.586 --> 28:39.979
I'm already tracing 'em.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.895
Signal's coming from
St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.766
Home of the U.S.
Penitentiary Slidell.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.550
I'll call Pride.

28:46.594 --> 28:49.379
PRIDE:
You're the boss.

28:49.423 --> 28:52.121
You've been calling
the shots all along.

28:52.165 --> 28:55.168
That's funny. It's also false.

28:55.211 --> 28:56.996
Evidence doesn't lie.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.258
But Apollyon does.

28:58.301 --> 28:59.607
My intel is reliable.

28:59.650 --> 29:01.435
Open your eyes, Pride.

29:01.478 --> 29:03.829
: The only thing
that Uncle Sam knows

29:03.872 --> 29:05.744
is what Apollyon wants it to.

29:05.787 --> 29:09.225
Misinformation, misdirection
to keep you and everyone else

29:09.269 --> 29:11.184
looking in all the wrong places.

29:11.227 --> 29:12.663
You could be doing
the same thing.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.274
No, it's not
in my best interest.

29:14.317 --> 29:15.666
Why is that?Well, I'm assuming

29:15.710 --> 29:17.146
that I am the only one

29:17.190 --> 29:18.844
from those photos
who's still breathing.

29:18.887 --> 29:21.934
Right?
So my former employer

29:21.977 --> 29:23.674
is gonna do everything he can

29:23.718 --> 29:26.590
to make sure that that is
a temporary condition.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.288
He can't get to you in here.

29:28.331 --> 29:31.334
Like he couldn't get to Amelia
or any of the others?

29:31.378 --> 29:34.294
You see, the only way
that I survive this

29:34.337 --> 29:36.339
is if the boss doesn't.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.820
What are you selling, Walker?

29:38.864 --> 29:41.214
The Holy Grail.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.432
Names,

29:42.476 --> 29:44.391
dates, places.

29:44.434 --> 29:47.437
Everything that you need
to take them down.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.831
You said you didn't know
anything.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.181
Well, I say a lot of things.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.357
See, Amelia wasn't
the only one

29:54.401 --> 29:56.577
with an insurance policy.

29:56.620 --> 29:59.449
Only, mine is up here.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.538
MAN: Attention, all blocks,
lockdown, lockdown.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.586
Inmates, return to your cells.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.153
What's happening?

30:07.196 --> 30:08.328
GUARD: Prisoner uprising
in Cell Block C.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.025
They killed a C.O.,

30:10.069 --> 30:11.592
and they're starting fires
everywhere.

30:11.635 --> 30:13.115
Where are you taking Walker?

30:13.159 --> 30:15.335
Isolation unit, and you'll
need to evacuate, sir.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.945
WALKER:
It's him, it's him, Pride.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.512
Apollyon's here for me.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.340
I'm coming with you.

30:35.355 --> 30:36.660
Walker!

30:36.704 --> 30:37.836
Walker!

30:54.940 --> 30:56.550
King, you all right?

30:56.593 --> 30:58.726
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Any word on Walker?

30:58.769 --> 30:59.901
He's still missing,
along with

30:59.945 --> 31:01.511
six other prisoners
and two COs.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.600
Still fighting the fire
but already found

31:03.644 --> 31:05.341
four bodies
burned beyond recognition.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.778
I tried to get Wade's office
to prioritize identification,

31:07.822 --> 31:09.606
but matching dental records
takes time.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.217
I think Walker was
telling the truth.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.696
Why, Sebastian?Well, because other
than the coordinates

31:12.740 --> 31:14.437
that led us to the prison,
nothing else makes sense.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.744
But you said the
Apollyon communications

31:16.787 --> 31:18.615
was protected by complex codes.

31:18.659 --> 31:21.053
Exactly, so why did it take us
only hours to decipher

31:21.096 --> 31:23.055
what NSA cryptologists
couldn't in years?

31:23.098 --> 31:25.231
You're saying intel
was manipulated to frame Walker?

31:25.274 --> 31:27.233
Yeah, and I'm sure of it.Well, how could someone

31:27.276 --> 31:29.409
plant false information
in a secure NSA file?

31:29.452 --> 31:31.106
There's only one way.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.761
Apollyon had someone
planted at the NSA,

31:33.804 --> 31:35.284
an inside man.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.678
Or woman.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.553
Hannah, driveway.

31:49.255 --> 31:52.171
NCIS! Hands on the
steering wheel, Cooper!

32:04.444 --> 32:06.925
Lasalle, I need your keys.

32:06.968 --> 32:09.014
Where you going?It's an emergency.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.277
Wait for backup to clear
the house. I'll explain later.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.206
Mommy!

32:32.951 --> 32:34.082
Naomi.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.997
Go to your room.But, Dad...

32:36.041 --> 32:40.132
Go, please. Thank you.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.134
This is not how
we are doing this.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.224
Ryan, you need to listen to me.You should've called first.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.966
Your friend Nancy
is dead.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.968
It's Apollyon.

32:50.011 --> 32:53.754
And, uh, because I sent
Pride to her, they could

32:53.797 --> 32:55.974
come after me next.I'm sorry.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.845
I-I shouldn't have gotten you
involved, and I'm sorry.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.064
I can't believe
this is happening

32:59.107 --> 33:01.631
again.I have no excuses.

33:01.675 --> 33:04.069
We don't have any time.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.853
There is nothing
more important to me

33:05.896 --> 33:07.115
than protecting you and Naomi.

33:07.159 --> 33:08.334
Oh, protecting?
Yes.

33:08.377 --> 33:09.596
Or abandoning?Ryan, please!

33:09.639 --> 33:11.685
Stop fighting!

33:17.212 --> 33:20.172
Let me take you
someplace safe. Okay?

33:20.215 --> 33:22.870
And then we can sit down
and we can talk.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.438
Okay.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.917
Thank you.Come on.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.203
Gregorio.

33:51.246 --> 33:52.900
Nancy Cooper was shot
in the head.

33:52.943 --> 33:54.728
The scene was staged
as a suicide.

33:54.771 --> 33:57.644
Framed and murdered by Apollyon.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.211
NSA's initiated
an emergency threat protocol.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.429
Which means they'll decommission

34:00.473 --> 34:01.865
any facility

34:01.909 --> 34:04.216
and secure personnel
that may have been compromised.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.739
It seems there's
only one analyst

34:05.782 --> 34:07.132
unaccounted for.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.395
Philip Sinclair.How'd you know?

34:09.438 --> 34:12.267
Sometimes the best place to hide
is in plain sight.

34:16.271 --> 34:20.406
Apollyon's never been caught
because it's run by the man

34:20.449 --> 34:23.452
whose job it is to catch 'em.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.802
This Sinclair is the boss?

34:28.327 --> 34:30.111
Yeah.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.940
And I think he wants me
to come get him.

34:44.299 --> 34:47.085
Welcome to Shangri-La,
Agent Pride.

34:47.128 --> 34:50.305
I see you found the gift
I left behind.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.926
Hands where I can see 'em.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.928
Take it easy.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.759
Weapons aren't really my thing.

35:12.501 --> 35:16.375
Cognac, on the other hand...

35:16.418 --> 35:17.637
You mind?

35:21.206 --> 35:24.948
I paid a million
for this bottle.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.565
I have to admit, I was nervous

35:32.608 --> 35:36.525
to meet you in person,
thought I might be disappointed.

35:37.918 --> 35:39.702
You lived up to expectations.

35:39.746 --> 35:40.877
You put me through hell.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.705
Ah, wasn't personal, really.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.577
Kidnap and murder
is always personal.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.536
If you had delivered
Amelia like I asked,

35:47.580 --> 35:49.016
your father would
still be alive.

35:49.059 --> 35:51.192
You would've killed
us regardless.

35:51.236 --> 35:54.108
That's what makes you feel
powerful, in control.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.329
Thanks to your
concerted efforts,

35:57.372 --> 35:59.940
every despot, corrupt CEO,
and miscreant politico

35:59.983 --> 36:02.725
from here to Kiev
will know my name.

36:02.769 --> 36:06.076
The target on my head
will be worth a fortune.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.515
All the monsters you made
will turn on their creator.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.734
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

36:11.778 --> 36:15.564
The countdown clock on my life
is already ticking.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.392
We all get what we deserve.

36:17.436 --> 36:20.221
I may be reprehensible
to someone like you,

36:20.265 --> 36:24.094
but remember,
the Angel of Death is not evil.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.401
She has a job to do.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.925
An unpleasant one, yes,

36:28.969 --> 36:32.407
but necessary. Like me.

36:32.451 --> 36:35.802
You're delusional.Maybe.

36:35.845 --> 36:39.806
But someone will take my place.
And chances are...

36:39.849 --> 36:43.853
they'll be far less civilized
than I am.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.555
Good luck with that.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.083
No.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.609
You don't get to take
the easy way out.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.916
"As I am now,

37:02.959 --> 37:05.571
"so you must be,

37:05.614 --> 37:10.358
prepare for death
and follow me."

37:47.874 --> 37:49.832
I'll be back.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.841
What the hell
you doing back here?

37:58.885 --> 38:01.191
I'm not even sure I
should be here, man.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.410
Come on, bro.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.456
Excuse us.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.198
Hey, look who I found.

the funeral arrangements, Rita.

38:41.406 --> 38:44.278
You made it special. It never
could have happened without you.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.888
Well, happy I could
help, Dwayne.

38:45.932 --> 38:48.543

39:58.265 --> 40:01.486
The visions... they're gone.

40:01.529 --> 40:05.533
Whatever they were,
they're not there anymore.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.621
And that's good, no?

40:06.665 --> 40:08.318
I don't know.

40:08.362 --> 40:12.322
I wanted them to end.
But now they have and...

What's that mean?

40:24.509 --> 40:26.511
It means let's drink.

40:49.142 --> 40:50.970
That was some party.

40:51.013 --> 40:53.059
Yeah.

40:53.102 --> 40:56.497
Most interesting funeral
that I have ever been to.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.499
Ah, New Orleans tradition.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.501
We know how to do it right.

41:00.545 --> 41:04.157
How's your daughter? And Ryan?

Ryan, um, that's...

He's a different story, but...

41:16.865 --> 41:20.565
At least we're talking.
That's a start.

41:20.608 --> 41:22.654
I was so petrified

41:22.697 --> 41:25.352
that Naomi
wouldn't forgive me...

41:27.354 --> 41:30.009
...I almost didn't
give her the chance.

41:30.052 --> 41:33.795
Children are very generous
at extending grace.

41:35.884 --> 41:38.887
We could all learn a lot
from them.

41:38.931 --> 41:40.933
That's my intention.

I need a few weeks.
