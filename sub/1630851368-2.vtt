Keep your head up.

58:30.708 --> 58:33.709
<i> This is shocking</i>
<i> and unfortunate.</i>

58:33.777 --> 58:37.179
But I didn't come here
to get close to anybody.

58:37.248 --> 58:40.449
I came here for money.
I came here to play for me.

58:40.518 --> 58:43.318
- And that's how you
execute a plan.

58:43.387 --> 58:46.388
- Ed and Emy getting it done.

58:46.457 --> 58:52.194
[all cheering]
- Yes, sir!

58:52.263 --> 58:53.595
- Great job.
- Thank you, Teej.

58:53.664 --> 58:56.331
- Thank you, Mr. TJ.
- Mr. TJ.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.867
- You're welcome, Ms. Emy.

58:58.936 --> 59:03.005
Now, you have
a decision to make.

59:03.073 --> 59:06.575
Do you want to stay together
as partners?

59:06.644 --> 59:09.077
Or do you want
to infiltrate and steal

59:09.146 --> 59:11.213
any other agent up there,

59:11.282 --> 59:13.282
except for the Agency,
of course.

59:13.350 --> 59:15.484
- You know, me and Emy,

59:15.553 --> 59:19.555
we've been
the Dream Team so far.

59:19.623 --> 59:21.623
But I think to go
a little further in this game,

59:21.692 --> 59:23.926
the both of us
are going to choose

59:23.994 --> 59:26.194
to steal another partner.

59:26.263 --> 59:28.730
- All right.

59:28.799 --> 59:30.832
Ed, let's start with you.

59:30.901 --> 59:34.069
Which agent you want to steal?

59:34.138 --> 59:36.805
- Well, um...

59:36.874 --> 59:40.342
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

59:40.411 --> 59:41.610
Tori.

59:41.679 --> 59:44.546
[oohs and cheers]

59:44.615 --> 59:48.116
- All right.
So Tori, come on down.

59:48.185 --> 59:50.052
- Thank you, man.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.486
- All right, Tori!

59:51.555 --> 59:54.256
- Now, Emy.
- Devin!

59:54.325 --> 59:56.558
[cheering and laughter]

59:56.627 --> 59:59.094
- All right, Devin,
come on down.

59:59.163 --> 1:00:01.697
- I'm the best challenger.
Picked over CT.

1:00:01.765 --> 1:00:03.832
Picked over Kyle.
Picked over Corey.

1:00:03.901 --> 1:00:06.068
<i> Eat my shorts.</i>
<i> I'm the best.</i>

1:00:06.136 --> 1:00:08.036
<i> Me and Emy.</i>
<i> Dream Team.</i>

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:10.806
Let's [bleep] go.

1:00:10.874 --> 1:00:14.710
- All right.
So Corey L., Michele,

1:00:14.778 --> 1:00:17.512
both of you had
your partners stolen.

1:00:17.581 --> 1:00:20.282
So now you are partners.
Come on down.

1:00:20.351 --> 1:00:24.519
- Michele and I definitely have
a target on our back.

1:00:24.588 --> 1:00:26.521
<i> We're a rookie-rookie team,</i>

1:00:26.590 --> 1:00:30.559
but we're also a rookie-rookie
team who's won an elimination.

1:00:30.628 --> 1:00:32.027
<i> They know we're a threat.</i>

1:00:32.096 --> 1:00:34.796
<i> And if we don't win</i>
<i> the next mission,</i>

1:00:34.865 --> 1:00:36.798
that we're gonna be back
in the Lair,

1:00:36.867 --> 1:00:40.168
so I'm hoping
that we can get number one.

1:00:40.237 --> 1:00:41.803
- All right, agents.

1:00:41.872 --> 1:00:46.441
What an unpredictable season
this is turning out to be, huh?

1:00:46.510 --> 1:00:49.277
Anything can happen on
"The Challenge."

1:00:49.346 --> 1:00:51.313
I'll see you soon.
Get out of here.

1:00:51.382 --> 1:00:52.514
[cheering]

1:00:52.583 --> 1:00:54.449
<i> - There's a lot</i>
<i> of rookies left.</i>

1:00:54.518 --> 1:00:56.385
<i> This vet alliance</i>
<i> is gonna go far,</i>

1:00:56.453 --> 1:00:59.388
but I don't know for how long
because these vets are snaky.

1:00:59.456 --> 1:01:01.790
- Well done, Emy!

1:01:01.859 --> 1:01:04.593
- What I learned from this week
is that it doesn't matter

1:01:04.662 --> 1:01:08.163
how strong a player you are.

1:01:08.232 --> 1:01:11.400
Your social game
needs to be top notch.

1:01:11.468 --> 1:01:13.902
- [bleep] crushing, baby!
Whoo!

1:01:13.971 --> 1:01:16.438
- Because that could be
the difference

1:01:16.507 --> 1:01:20.976
between you staying in the game
and you going home.

1:01:21.045 --> 1:01:24.146
- It was the harder thing ever.
You can't imagine.

1:01:28.052 --> 1:01:29.484
- Big T, I don't trust her.

1:01:29.553 --> 1:01:32.154
<i> - I feel as if the vets see me</i>
<i> as a rat.</i>

1:01:32.222 --> 1:01:35.223
<i> - Today's challenge is called</i>
<i> Team Cave Recon.</i>

1:01:35.292 --> 1:01:37.325
- Oh, my God, it's so high,
so I'm terrified.

1:01:37.394 --> 1:01:39.061
<i> - Who the hell would want</i>
<i> to do this willingly?</i>

1:01:39.129 --> 1:01:41.697
<i> This cave is so dangerous.</i>

1:01:41.765 --> 1:01:43.799
<i> - All I see is this blood.</i>

1:01:43.867 --> 1:01:46.401
<i> - This is scary.</i>
