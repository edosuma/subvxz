00:01.369 --> 00:04.636
Russia may be one
of the areas on this planet

00:04.739 --> 00:06.538
that has been ladened with

00:06.640 --> 00:08.674
incredible amounts of UFO activity

00:08.776 --> 00:10.743
since the beginning of time.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.112
These flying machines

00:13.214 --> 00:15.781
were seen all over the Soviet Union.

00:15.883 --> 00:19.685
The Soviets knew something about UFOs.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.420
They had secrets.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.289
The Soviets have in their possession

00:24.392 --> 00:28.227
no less than the remains of five
crashed and recovered UFOs.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.763
There is undeniable evidence

00:30.865 --> 00:34.333
that Russia is sitting
on a virtual treasure trove

00:34.435 --> 00:37.202
of information that proves

00:37.304 --> 00:39.972
that extraterrestrials visited
Earth in our distant past.

00:40.074 --> 00:43.542
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:43.644 --> 00:47.479
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:47.581 --> 00:50.282
and other visitors from the stars.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.718
What if it were true?

00:52.820 --> 00:55.587
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:55.689 --> 00:58.657
really help to shape our history?

00:58.759 --> 01:00.659
And if so...

01:00.761 --> 01:02.227
might the ultimate proof

01:02.329 --> 01:06.932
be found in Russia's secret files?

# Ancient Aliens 11x12 #
Russia's Secret Files
Original Air Date on August 12, 2016

01:35.629 --> 01:38.597
Moscow, Russia.

01:38.699 --> 01:42.935
December 25, 1991.

01:43.037 --> 01:47.706
At 7:00 p.m., Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev

01:47.808 --> 01:50.342
makes a nationally televised address

01:50.444 --> 01:53.112
to announce his resignation.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.746
I hereby discontinue

01:54.849 --> 01:58.884
my activities at the post
of President of the USSR.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.120
Moments later,

02:01.222 --> 02:03.856
the Soviet flag is lowered
from the Kremlin

02:03.958 --> 02:06.792
for the final time.

02:06.894 --> 02:10.529
One of the world's two superpowers...

02:10.631 --> 02:11.930
has fallen.

02:15.736 --> 02:19.238
From 1922 to 1991,

02:19.340 --> 02:21.807
Russia was under the restrictive regime

02:21.909 --> 02:25.144
of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics,

02:25.246 --> 02:27.679
which ruled over much of northern Asia

02:27.781 --> 02:29.515
and Eastern Europe.

02:31.085 --> 02:34.153
The Soviet government was known
for its brutality,

02:34.255 --> 02:38.023
oppression and culture
of absolute secrecy.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.532
It was very much a case

02:46.634 --> 02:48.567
of everything that happens

02:48.669 --> 02:51.003
within government
stays within government,

02:51.105 --> 02:52.704
and the consequences were lethal.

02:57.678 --> 03:02.347
This was a closed,
highly secretive society

03:02.449 --> 03:04.483
that kept secrets, not just, of course,

03:04.585 --> 03:06.785
from us in the West,

03:06.887 --> 03:08.720
but from its own people.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.823
One of the challenges of defending

03:11.926 --> 03:14.726
this vast landmass
in Russia is that, uh,

03:14.828 --> 03:18.030
its borders are very insecure,
at all points.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.233
So in order to conquer space,

03:21.335 --> 03:24.703
it has an obsession
with national security.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.706
Secrecy has become imbedded
within the political culture;

03:27.808 --> 03:30.709
and also, many people
in Russia agree with the idea

03:30.811 --> 03:33.345
that most things
should be kept a secret.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.382
When the Soviet Union was dissolved,

03:37.484 --> 03:42.354
so too was its main security
agency-- the KGB.

03:42.456 --> 03:46.391
The top-secret KGB files
were suddenly vulnerable,

03:46.493 --> 03:48.927
with many in the hands of former agents,

03:49.029 --> 03:51.697
ready to sell them
to the highest bidders.

03:51.799 --> 03:56.368
Thousands more were smuggled out
by Vasiliy Mitrokhin,

03:56.470 --> 04:00.505
who worked in the KGB's
foreign intelligence archive

04:00.608 --> 04:04.509
from 1972 to 1984.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.478
The documents that have been leaked

04:06.580 --> 04:10.649
include KGB information on
secret Russian weapons caches,

04:10.751 --> 04:12.317
Russian spies,

04:12.419 --> 04:15.020
and even UFO reports.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.421
The Soviet Union

04:16.523 --> 04:19.791
had a large number of UFO encounters.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.294
Western researchers
had really no knowledge

04:22.396 --> 04:24.997
of what was going on
behind the Iron Curtain.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.967
We now know that there were thousands

04:29.069 --> 04:31.903
and thousands of Soviet UFO cases

04:32.006 --> 04:33.338
that were taking place during that time.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.874
A number of records did indeed come out.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.342
And we now have access to them.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.045
Could the definitive evidence

04:40.147 --> 04:42.347
of extraterrestrial contact

04:42.449 --> 04:45.417
lie hidden within the secret KGB files

04:45.519 --> 04:47.786
that are just now coming to light?

04:47.888 --> 04:51.990
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

04:52.092 --> 04:54.760
and suggest recent findings reveal

04:54.862 --> 04:59.298
the Soviets were not only
covering up modern UFO reports,

04:59.400 --> 05:02.601
but also proof that aliens visited Earth

05:02.703 --> 05:05.504
in the distant past.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.474
Leningrad, Russia.

05:09.576 --> 05:13.412
December 1, 1934.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.380
Sergei Kirov,

05:15.482 --> 05:17.082
a Communist party leader

05:17.184 --> 05:21.787
and rival to fellow party leader
Joseph Stalin, is murdered.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.591
The assassination marks the beginning

05:26.694 --> 05:30.562
of the darkest period in the
history of the Soviet Union:

05:30.664 --> 05:33.865
The Great Purges.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.868
With Kirov gone,

05:36.970 --> 05:38.704
Stalin's power grew,

05:38.806 --> 05:41.840
and he unleashed a widespread campaign

05:41.942 --> 05:44.042
of ruthless political persecution

05:44.144 --> 05:45.977
meant to weed out dissenters...

05:47.981 --> 05:51.416
and consolidate his absolute authority.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.222
Among the millions who were arrested

05:57.324 --> 05:59.958
and interrogated during this period

06:00.060 --> 06:01.727
was respected Russian scientist

06:01.829 --> 06:05.230
and philosopher Dr. Genrikh Ludvig.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.267
An incredible human being.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.104
This was a person
who could speak 20 ancient

06:12.206 --> 06:14.072
and modern languages.

06:14.174 --> 06:17.376
He had incredible
encyclopedic knowledge.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.946
Dr. Ludvig was accused

06:21.048 --> 06:23.115
of being a spy for the Vatican

06:23.217 --> 06:25.150
and spent decades

06:25.252 --> 06:29.488
in one of Stalin's
brutal Gulag labor camps.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.023
But in 2011,

06:32.126 --> 06:34.626
38 years after his death,

06:34.728 --> 06:38.497
an article in the Russian
newspaper Sovershenno Sekretno,

06:38.599 --> 06:40.232
or Top Secret,

06:40.334 --> 06:44.236
revealed the true purpose of
Ludvig's work at the Vatican,

06:44.338 --> 06:49.207
and possibly also for his arrest.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.177
The reason he was accused
of being a spy for the Vatican

06:52.279 --> 06:54.012
is because in 1920s,

06:54.114 --> 06:56.915
as a young student of architecture,

06:57.017 --> 06:59.985
he visited the Vatican,

07:00.087 --> 07:03.622
where he was given access
to the secret library.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.691
In that library, he found manuscripts

07:06.794 --> 07:10.729
that describe extraterrestrial
civilizations and more.

07:12.733 --> 07:16.201
Dr. Genrikh Ludvig discovered
a number of manuscripts

07:16.303 --> 07:17.836
suggesting that there had been

07:17.938 --> 07:21.173
historic extraterrestrial contact

07:21.275 --> 07:26.645
with ancient civilizations in Egypt,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.146
Israel

07:28.248 --> 07:30.949
and Mesopotamia.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.985
These manuscripts that talked,
for example,

07:34.087 --> 07:35.654
about the pyramids

07:35.756 --> 07:39.257
and described them as energy machines.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.830
When he went back to the Soviet Union,

07:44.932 --> 07:46.965
they treated him very poorly,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.900
when, in fact, he was perhaps

07:49.002 --> 07:52.938
the greatest
of all the early researchers

07:53.040 --> 07:56.942
into the whole concept of ancient aliens

07:57.044 --> 07:58.176
coming to our planet.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.816
Might Dr. Ludvig have really discovered

08:04.918 --> 08:07.085
ancient manuscripts within the Vatican

08:07.187 --> 08:09.087
that describe extraterrestrials

08:09.189 --> 08:11.122
visiting Earth?

08:11.225 --> 08:13.058
Did the Russian government

08:13.160 --> 08:15.694
accuse him of espionage in an attempt

08:15.796 --> 08:18.630
to suppress his controversial findings?

08:20.033 --> 08:23.134
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

08:23.237 --> 08:26.938
and claim Ludwig was not
the only one silenced

08:27.040 --> 08:29.875
by the Soviet government
for his research.

08:32.712 --> 08:36.581
When Vladimir Lenin
seized power in 1917,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.517
he established the first state

08:38.619 --> 08:41.052
to seek the elimination of religion.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.688
The Communist regime

08:43.789 --> 08:46.725
also actively suppressed a philosophy

08:46.827 --> 08:49.094
that had become widespread
throughout Russia

08:49.196 --> 08:51.830
in the early 20th century:

08:51.932 --> 08:53.698
Cosmism.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.036
There is a Russian tradition,

08:58.138 --> 09:01.740
beginning in the late 1800s
called "Cosmism".

09:01.842 --> 09:05.243
The cosmists began with a philosopher,

09:05.345 --> 09:07.612
a guy named Nikolai Fyodorov,

09:07.714 --> 09:09.447
in the 1870s and 1880s,

09:09.550 --> 09:12.217
who inspired the father
of Soviet rocketry,

09:12.319 --> 09:13.885
who actually designed the rockets

09:13.987 --> 09:15.687
that put the first man into space.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.089
They believed that human civilization

09:18.191 --> 09:19.958
actually had origins

09:20.060 --> 09:22.627
in outer space

09:22.729 --> 09:25.630
and that it was our destiny,
as human beings,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.198
to move back into space;

09:27.301 --> 09:30.268
we would go back into
the "cradle of civilization."

09:30.370 --> 09:34.139
And after Joseph Stalin died,
many of those individuals

09:34.241 --> 09:35.774
that were exploring the idea

09:35.876 --> 09:38.910
of ancient paleo-contacts with aliens,

09:39.012 --> 09:42.247
uh, were allowed to voice
their opinions publicly.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.684
In 1961,

09:45.786 --> 09:49.688
Russian physicist
and mathematician Matest Agrest

09:49.790 --> 09:51.756
published a controversial paper

09:51.858 --> 09:54.426
proposing that extraterrestrials

09:54.528 --> 09:58.029
had visited
Earth's ancient civilizations.

09:58.131 --> 10:01.600
Similar theories were also offered

10:01.702 --> 10:03.702
by author Alexander Kasantsev

10:03.804 --> 10:06.605
and astronomer Iosif Shklovskii.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.208
But while these researchers
did not suffer

10:10.310 --> 10:13.645
the same persecution
as those that came before them,

10:13.747 --> 10:16.314
they claimed that the Soviet government

10:16.416 --> 10:19.217
worked to suppress their theories.

10:20.354 --> 10:21.920
The idea

10:22.022 --> 10:23.755
that there were Soviet astronomers

10:23.857 --> 10:26.558
who were seriously studying

10:26.660 --> 10:28.593
these topics and ideas

10:28.695 --> 10:30.295
leads me to think

10:30.397 --> 10:32.631
that we're the one's
who are on to something.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.102
And we are now able
to access information

10:37.204 --> 10:39.738
that for so many years,
has remained censored.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.310
Is it possible

10:45.412 --> 10:48.480
that the truth about
extraterrestrial contact

10:48.582 --> 10:50.782
was hidden behind the Iron Curtain

10:50.884 --> 10:53.818
of the former Soviet Union?

10:55.088 --> 10:57.589
Perhaps further clues can be found

10:57.691 --> 11:01.526
by examining a mysterious site
that may hold proof

11:01.628 --> 11:05.463
of an ancient
extraterrestrial visitation.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.135
Coming up...

11:10.237 --> 11:11.703
Arkaim has been described

11:11.805 --> 11:14.239
as Russia's Stonehenge.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.042
Someone, possibly extraterrestrials,

11:17.144 --> 11:20.945
identified this
as a site of special energy.

11:26.461 --> 11:27.961
Russia.

11:29.698 --> 11:31.364
Spanning a staggering

11:31.466 --> 11:34.034
6.6 million square miles,

11:34.136 --> 11:37.003
it is the largest country on Earth.

11:37.973 --> 11:40.140
Its massive territory

11:40.242 --> 11:43.510
is also the most geographically diverse,

11:43.612 --> 11:47.981
consisting of some of the most
extreme terrain on the planet,

11:48.083 --> 11:51.718
including dense forests,

11:51.820 --> 11:54.754
frozen tundra,

11:54.856 --> 11:57.023
remote mountains,

11:57.125 --> 12:00.327
and barren deserts.

12:01.496 --> 12:03.763
Despite its physical size,

12:03.865 --> 12:05.799
as much as 50% of Russia

12:05.901 --> 12:07.067
remains uninhabited

12:07.169 --> 12:11.204
and largely unexplored by mankind.

12:14.810 --> 12:18.478
Russia is almost twice the size
of the United States.

12:19.815 --> 12:22.015
Just to compare, the United States

12:22.117 --> 12:25.251
expands over four time zones,

12:25.354 --> 12:28.888
while Russia expands
over eleven time zones.

12:28.991 --> 12:30.857
The size of Russia,

12:30.959 --> 12:33.627
its harsh climate,

12:33.729 --> 12:35.362
especially
in the northern parts of Russia,

12:35.464 --> 12:38.498
makes it very difficult to explore.

12:42.838 --> 12:45.705
One of Russia's most mysterious areas

12:45.807 --> 12:48.475
is a valley just north of Kazakhstan,

12:48.577 --> 12:50.844
where in 1987,

12:50.946 --> 12:53.947
archaeologists from
the University of Chelyabinsk

12:54.049 --> 12:57.083
discovered the remains
of an ancient settlement,

12:57.185 --> 12:58.985
which they were able to date back

12:59.087 --> 13:03.556
to between the 17th and 20th
centuries B.C.

13:03.659 --> 13:07.627
Much of the original structures
of this megalithic site,

13:07.729 --> 13:10.797
known as Arkaim, no longer exist,

13:10.899 --> 13:14.401
but scientists have mapped out
its original design,

13:14.503 --> 13:17.937
which includes massive circular walls

13:18.040 --> 13:20.540
similar to Stonehenge.

13:22.711 --> 13:25.679
So, Arkaim has been described
as Russia's Stonehenge.

13:25.781 --> 13:27.147
Now, this is quite intriguing

13:27.249 --> 13:30.550
because its a very similar
latitude to Stonehenge.

13:30.652 --> 13:33.753
It's been suggested that
it could've been put there

13:33.855 --> 13:36.222
for astronomical and surveying purposes.

13:38.293 --> 13:40.627
It seems that Arkaim, at some point,

13:40.729 --> 13:42.762
was some type of an observatory,

13:42.864 --> 13:45.098
which I think is incredibly fascinating,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.767
because it means that worldwide,

13:47.869 --> 13:50.770
our ancestors witnessed other things

13:50.872 --> 13:53.506
that would explain this long-held

13:53.608 --> 13:56.843
fascination with the stars.

13:56.945 --> 13:58.778
The way the city was built,

13:58.880 --> 14:00.814
it was a circular structure.

14:00.916 --> 14:04.350
It had a very interesting
central square.

14:04.453 --> 14:07.587
Basically, it was an interior circle

14:07.689 --> 14:10.724
surrounded by a circle, which to many,

14:10.826 --> 14:13.460
means the Mandala principle
of the Buddhism...

14:15.764 --> 14:17.564
...or a depiction of the universe

14:17.666 --> 14:20.633
in a very miniaturized way.

14:26.274 --> 14:28.908
Incredibly, archaeologists have found

14:29.010 --> 14:33.079
that Arkaim was built with
features aligned to measure

14:33.181 --> 14:35.648
as many as 18 astronomical events,

14:35.751 --> 14:39.085
such as the solstices and equinoxes.

14:39.187 --> 14:41.721
And discovered among the ruins

14:41.823 --> 14:43.923
was an ancient statue of a man

14:44.025 --> 14:45.692
looking up to the sky.

14:48.163 --> 14:49.596
Adding to the mystery

14:49.698 --> 14:52.932
are reports of strange anomalies
in the region,

14:53.034 --> 14:55.235
that continue to this day,

14:55.337 --> 14:58.938
which include magnetic inconsistencies,

14:59.040 --> 15:02.175
strange lights,

15:02.277 --> 15:04.477
and curious fog formations.

15:10.786 --> 15:13.119
When you consider the strange lights,

15:13.221 --> 15:16.189
the weird fog, the magnetic anomalies,

15:16.291 --> 15:18.391
the unusual hallucinations,

15:18.493 --> 15:20.326
and things that have happened
to people there,

15:20.428 --> 15:23.229
it appears that this
is some sort of energy node

15:23.331 --> 15:25.231
or vortex point on the Earth...

15:27.235 --> 15:29.936
...that was actually utilized
by extraterrestrials

15:30.038 --> 15:32.405
when this was constructed.

15:32.507 --> 15:36.242
If you actually look
at the shape of Arkaim,

15:36.344 --> 15:39.612
it could have been the platform
for a spacecraft,

15:39.714 --> 15:41.748
like a rocket, to launch off from.

15:47.556 --> 15:50.356
Could Arkaim really have been the site

15:50.458 --> 15:52.692
of an extraterrestrial visitation

15:52.794 --> 15:54.894
thousands of years ago?

15:54.996 --> 15:58.431
And might this be why
the structures found here

15:58.533 --> 16:02.101
were built with such precise
astronomical alignments?

16:03.538 --> 16:06.973
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

16:07.075 --> 16:10.810
and suggest physical evidence
of such a visitation

16:10.912 --> 16:14.047
might exist
in the nearby Ural Mountains.

16:18.687 --> 16:22.155
Ural Mountains are very old mountains

16:22.257 --> 16:24.257
stretching from, uh,

16:24.359 --> 16:27.260
the Russian north to the Russian south.

16:30.332 --> 16:33.333
It, kind of, splitting Russia
into two parts,

16:33.435 --> 16:35.201
Europe and Asia.

16:35.303 --> 16:39.072
Indeed, people living
in the Ural Mountains,

16:39.174 --> 16:43.209
witness some strange phenomena
in the air and on the ground.

16:43.311 --> 16:47.046
Dozens of visitors to the Ural Mountains

16:47.148 --> 16:49.849
have reported strange sightings
of fireballs

16:49.951 --> 16:52.151
and cigar-shaped crafts.

16:52.254 --> 16:53.786
But even stranger,

16:53.889 --> 16:57.056
is what has been found
in the earth here.

16:57.158 --> 17:01.294
In 1991, geologists led an expedition

17:01.396 --> 17:06.199
into the mineral-rich Urals in
hopes of locating gold deposits.

17:06.300 --> 17:10.169
While excavating sites
near the Kozhim, Narada,

17:10.271 --> 17:12.271
and Balbanyu rivers,

17:12.374 --> 17:15.174
just 600 miles north of Arkaim,

17:15.277 --> 17:18.778
the scientists discovered
something unexpected.

17:20.181 --> 17:21.948
At depths of over 30 feet,

17:22.050 --> 17:27.453
they unearthed a scattering
of tiny metal coils and springs.

17:30.959 --> 17:34.060
That soil wasn't touched
for hundreds of thousands

17:34.162 --> 17:35.361
or more years.

17:36.831 --> 17:38.765
The area where it was found,

17:38.867 --> 17:41.935
was probably tens of kilometers around.

17:42.037 --> 17:45.872
It's as if something exploded
thousands of years ago

17:48.076 --> 17:50.476
and the fragments were lying
all over the place.

17:54.516 --> 17:55.882
The metal fragments,

17:55.984 --> 17:58.785
some as small as 1/10,000 of an inch,

17:58.887 --> 18:01.721
were sent to the Russian
Academy of Sciences

18:01.823 --> 18:04.757
in St. Petersburg for analysis.

18:04.859 --> 18:08.494
Their shape resembled
manufactured technology,

18:08.596 --> 18:11.831
rather than
naturally occurring minerals.

18:11.933 --> 18:15.802
The smallest pieces were found
to be tungsten,

18:15.904 --> 18:18.938
a metal used in spacecrafts
and missiles,

18:19.040 --> 18:22.542
due to its ability
to withstand high temperatures.

18:26.114 --> 18:28.114
They are these metal spirals

18:28.216 --> 18:31.484
that consist of copper,
but also tungsten,

18:31.586 --> 18:33.152
and Molybdenum,

18:33.254 --> 18:36.422
which are both very rare metals.

18:36.524 --> 18:39.092
We're looking at nanotechnology.

18:39.194 --> 18:42.095
When you look down
at them in a microscope,

18:42.197 --> 18:44.330
they're extremely regular
in their structure.

18:44.432 --> 18:46.699
They're very nice coils.

18:46.801 --> 18:49.969
The only way we could make them,
even now,

18:50.071 --> 18:52.839
is with machine-guided technology.

18:52.941 --> 18:55.408
You could not do this by hand.

18:55.510 --> 18:59.312
What we're seeing here is proof

18:59.414 --> 19:01.848
that someone had advanced technology

19:01.950 --> 19:04.617
sufficient to build
the type of circuitry

19:04.719 --> 19:08.187
that we normally only see
in semiconductors,

19:08.289 --> 19:10.223
computer chips,

19:10.325 --> 19:12.625
high technology equipment,

19:12.727 --> 19:16.229
using metals
that are not commonly known.

19:16.331 --> 19:19.532
So these spirals are clear evidence

19:19.634 --> 19:23.302
that someone had
a very advanced civilization

19:23.405 --> 19:26.639
right here on Earth near Arkaim.

19:30.578 --> 19:32.311
Might extraterrestrials

19:32.414 --> 19:35.648
have visited the Ural Mountains
in the distant past?

19:35.750 --> 19:38.451
And if so,
did they leave behind evidence

19:38.553 --> 19:41.421
of advanced technology?

19:41.523 --> 19:43.656
Could they have helped to build

19:43.758 --> 19:46.459
the prehistoric observatory of Arkaim,

19:46.561 --> 19:49.896
as ancient astronaut theorists contend?

19:49.998 --> 19:52.999
Perhaps further clues can be found

19:53.101 --> 19:56.202
by examining much more recent accounts

19:56.304 --> 19:58.805
of otherworldly visitations.

20:04.345 --> 20:08.047
He had collected hundreds of UFO cases.

20:08.149 --> 20:11.651
The Soviet Union would
not give it public credence.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.920
But we now have very good
information that

20:14.022 --> 20:15.021
it was reality.

20:22.530 --> 20:23.495
Moscow.

20:23.598 --> 20:26.999
May 17, 1967.

20:29.303 --> 20:31.236
In a secure government building,

20:31.339 --> 20:34.873
a meeting is held
of scientists dedicated

20:34.976 --> 20:37.142
to collecting comprehensive research

20:37.244 --> 20:40.579
on reports of unidentified flying craft.

20:42.350 --> 20:46.552
It is the first official
Soviet UFO Study Group,

20:46.654 --> 20:50.389
and six months later, on November 10,

20:50.491 --> 20:51.957
the government gives its approval

20:52.059 --> 20:54.960
for the group's deputy,
astronomer Felix Ziegel,

20:55.062 --> 20:56.595
to present its findings

20:56.697 --> 20:58.731
on Soviet Central Television.

21:00.334 --> 21:02.601
Felix Ziegel asked the public

21:02.703 --> 21:05.904
to contact them with sightings.

21:06.007 --> 21:08.040
Now this was
an extraordinary development.

21:09.543 --> 21:12.678
Previously, little if anything,
had been made public

21:12.780 --> 21:15.614
about official interest in this.

21:15.716 --> 21:19.118
And here you have somebody
going on television

21:19.220 --> 21:20.819
talking about it quite openly

21:20.921 --> 21:23.288
and inviting people
to send in their sightings.

21:23.391 --> 21:25.124
Well, needless to say,

21:25.226 --> 21:29.028
there were a lot of sightings
that were then reported,

21:29.130 --> 21:30.963
but the project itself

21:31.065 --> 21:35.934
soon was dogged
by controversy and dissent.

21:37.471 --> 21:40.005
Shortly after the television broadcast,

21:40.107 --> 21:43.175
the government forced the group
to be disbanded,

21:43.277 --> 21:47.279
fearful that it might lead
to reports surfacing

21:47.381 --> 21:51.216
of top secret Soviet military tests.

21:51.318 --> 21:55.788
But Ziegel still managed to
collect a huge amount of data,

21:55.890 --> 21:59.958
including reports from Russian pilots.

22:00.061 --> 22:02.695
He was able
to publish some of his findings

22:02.797 --> 22:08.267
in a 1968 anthology
titled Inhabited Cosmos.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.969
I met Felix Ziegel in Moscow.

22:11.072 --> 22:14.640
He had collected hundreds of UFO cases.

22:14.742 --> 22:17.643
He said that these flying objects

22:17.745 --> 22:20.412
were seen all over the Soviet Union.

22:20.514 --> 22:24.850
Some of them were small,
others large and spherical.

22:24.952 --> 22:28.153
Their technology
must be extraterrestrial,

22:28.255 --> 22:31.290
because they reach an incredible speed

22:31.392 --> 22:34.827
that no human would survive.

22:34.929 --> 22:37.596
While publicly the Soviet government

22:37.698 --> 22:40.766
denounced the research of Felix Ziegel,

22:40.868 --> 22:44.303
they did not stop him
from continuing his work,

22:44.405 --> 22:47.306
and even reviewed his findings.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.541
But why?

22:52.880 --> 22:56.348
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that the government

22:56.450 --> 22:59.785
may have been aware that there
really was an alien presence

22:59.887 --> 23:02.087
in their skies.

23:02.189 --> 23:05.791
And they used Ziegel
and other UFO researchers

23:05.893 --> 23:10.763
as a way to secretly monitor
this activity.

23:10.865 --> 23:12.531
A number of records have surfaced

23:12.633 --> 23:15.334
from the Soviet Air Force and the KGB,

23:15.436 --> 23:18.604
showing that particularly
in the '50s, '60s, and '70s,

23:18.706 --> 23:22.174
they took the UFO subject
very, very seriously.

23:24.478 --> 23:25.744
Soviet scientists

23:25.846 --> 23:28.647
had to come up with incredible ways

23:28.749 --> 23:30.883
with which to share their knowledge

23:30.985 --> 23:33.685
with their colleagues
in the Western World.

23:33.788 --> 23:38.690
So, they essentially
hid their messages in code,

23:38.793 --> 23:42.594
in letters, in different types
of correspondence.

23:42.696 --> 23:45.364
Why would anyone risk going to jail

23:45.466 --> 23:48.700
by encoding messages
to people and scientists

23:48.803 --> 23:50.202
outside the Iron Curtain,

23:50.304 --> 23:51.770
if you weren't compelled enough

23:51.872 --> 23:54.873
that what you're writing about
is the truth?

23:57.344 --> 24:00.746
Throughout the 1960s
and most of the '70s,

24:00.848 --> 24:05.818
the Soviet government's interest
in UFOs remained unofficial.

24:05.920 --> 24:10.255
But that changed
after September 20, 1977,

24:10.357 --> 24:13.258
when numerous residents of Petrozavodsk

24:13.360 --> 24:17.196
reported seeing a glowing object
floating in the sky above

24:17.298 --> 24:19.097
for over 5 minutes,

24:19.200 --> 24:21.934
showering the city with rays of light.

24:22.036 --> 24:24.736
A copy remains of a lost photograph

24:24.839 --> 24:26.705
that was taken of the object,

24:26.807 --> 24:29.575
and astonishingly,

24:29.677 --> 24:31.543
similar UFOs were reported

24:31.645 --> 24:35.414
all across Russia and Eastern Europe

24:35.516 --> 24:38.250
within a four-hour window.

24:39.553 --> 24:42.221
On the heels of this mass sighting,

24:42.323 --> 24:43.989
the Soviet Union established

24:44.091 --> 24:48.260
the Russian Academy of Sciences'
UFO commission.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.462
In 1984,

24:50.564 --> 24:53.732
they appointed
Major-General Pavel Popovich,

24:53.834 --> 24:56.535
the eighth man ever to reach space,

24:56.637 --> 24:59.271
to head up this research team.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.306
Pavel Popovich brought forth

25:01.408 --> 25:03.775
a lot of the UFO information himself

25:03.878 --> 25:07.679
and he was able to obtain
the KGB UFO files--

25:07.781 --> 25:10.148
124 pages-- in 1992.

25:10.251 --> 25:12.551
He said that he knew of the existence

25:12.653 --> 25:14.419
of three underwater bases,

25:14.521 --> 25:17.990
where the extraterrestrials
exist and operate.

25:18.092 --> 25:21.326
This is a man whom we should listen to.

25:22.830 --> 25:25.330
He had two UFO sightings himself,

25:25.432 --> 25:27.933
a very significant one in 1978,

25:28.035 --> 25:32.537
when he was flying back from the
United States to, uh, to Russia.

25:35.342 --> 25:38.877
Out his window,
he saw an absolutely enormous--

25:38.979 --> 25:41.513
football field size, or larger--

25:41.615 --> 25:43.382
triangular craft,

25:43.484 --> 25:45.384
that was moving at a really good clip.

25:45.486 --> 25:46.885
I mean, easily overtook,

25:46.987 --> 25:49.054
uh... the commercial airliner
that he was in.

25:49.156 --> 25:52.624
He wasn't the only one on his
plane to see this, by the way.

25:52.726 --> 25:54.459
He talked to a lot of the other people,

25:54.561 --> 25:56.828
many of whom where academicians,
coming back from a conference,

25:56.931 --> 25:59.331
many of whom saw this.

26:01.902 --> 26:04.703
Did Major-General Pavel Popovich

26:04.805 --> 26:09.341
really witness firsthand
an extraterrestrial spacecraft?

26:10.778 --> 26:12.744
And might he also have found evidence

26:12.846 --> 26:14.980
in secret KGB files

26:15.082 --> 26:18.383
of underwater alien bases?

26:18.485 --> 26:21.453
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

26:21.555 --> 26:25.357
and suggest even more profound
evidence can be found

26:25.459 --> 26:28.627
in a small mountain town
in eastern Russia:

26:28.729 --> 26:30.429
the remains

26:30.531 --> 26:33.365
of a crashed UFO.

26:36.070 --> 26:37.736
What people there saw

26:37.838 --> 26:41.073
was this low flying, very slow object.

26:41.175 --> 26:43.041
It dropped, almost like a stone.

26:44.511 --> 26:46.611
It wasn't made on planet Earth.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.437
One of the most decorated test pilots

26:55.539 --> 26:56.905
in Russian history

26:57.007 --> 26:59.708
is a woman named Marina Popovich,

26:59.810 --> 27:02.945
the wife of astronaut Pavel Popovich.

27:04.848 --> 27:07.916
Marina set over 100 records
during her career

27:08.018 --> 27:10.018
in the Soviet Air Force,

27:10.120 --> 27:12.387
which includes being the first woman

27:12.489 --> 27:15.591
to break the sound barrier.

27:17.962 --> 27:19.595
Like her husband,

27:19.697 --> 27:23.732
she, too, reported
on extraterrestrial encounters.

27:25.202 --> 27:28.470
In 2003, Marina published a book

27:28.572 --> 27:33.542
disclosing her firsthand
experiences with UFOs.

27:33.644 --> 27:35.811
In it, she also referenced

27:35.913 --> 27:38.347
thousands of similar UFO sightings

27:38.449 --> 27:39.915
by other Soviet military

27:40.017 --> 27:41.650
and civilian pilots.

27:44.154 --> 27:47.055
She told their stories
at speaking engagements

27:47.157 --> 27:48.490
all over the world.

27:48.592 --> 27:50.926
Like the story of a fighter pilot

27:51.028 --> 27:53.362
who was asked to fire upon
an unidentified,

27:53.464 --> 27:55.797
disc-shaped craft.

28:12.650 --> 28:15.951
Marina Popovich is one of the
most famous aviators in history.

28:16.053 --> 28:18.320
She was in a good position
to know what she knew.

28:18.422 --> 28:20.689
She was a very well connected
individual.

28:22.593 --> 28:25.327
She talked about something like
3,000 UFO cases

28:25.429 --> 28:26.828
that had occurred in the Soviet Union

28:26.930 --> 28:28.230
over the years which,

28:28.332 --> 28:30.132
considering the fact that
we knew next to nothing

28:30.234 --> 28:32.668
about the history
of Soviet UFOs before that,

28:32.770 --> 28:34.503
was very significant.

28:34.605 --> 28:38.040
There is particular interest
in sightings from pilots.

28:38.142 --> 28:42.644
Pilots are able, for example,
to judge distances,

28:42.746 --> 28:47.449
speeds, heights, in a way that
maybe the average person can't.

28:47.551 --> 28:50.152
And Marina Popovich
has made a particular effort

28:50.254 --> 28:53.989
to collate all these pilot stories.

28:55.893 --> 28:57.459
What's particularly notable

28:57.561 --> 29:01.063
about Marina Popovich's comments
on the UFO subject

29:01.165 --> 29:04.266
is that she stated that
sources have informed her

29:04.368 --> 29:06.868
that the Soviets have
in their possession

29:06.970 --> 29:10.706
no less than the remains of five
crashed and recovered UFOs.

29:13.277 --> 29:16.211
Did both Marina and Pavel Popovich,

29:16.313 --> 29:20.048
along with scores of other
respected Soviet pilots,

29:20.150 --> 29:22.984
really encounter alien crafts?

29:23.087 --> 29:25.020
And if so,

29:25.122 --> 29:27.055
might there be even more sightings

29:27.157 --> 29:29.024
recorded by the Russian authorities

29:29.126 --> 29:32.761
that have not yet been disclosed
to the public?

29:37.034 --> 29:38.600
Dalnegorsk, Russia.

29:38.702 --> 29:42.637
January 29, 1986.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.706
Just before 8:00 p.m.,

29:44.808 --> 29:47.909
in this small mining town
in eastern Russia,

29:48.011 --> 29:51.613
hundreds of people
see a red, glowing, sphere

29:51.715 --> 29:55.884
moving slowly through the sky
above a nearby mountain.

29:55.986 --> 29:57.753
It appeared to slow down,

29:57.855 --> 30:00.956
before crashing into the hillside.

30:03.827 --> 30:07.095
Many reported seeing
a fiery blaze from the site

30:07.197 --> 30:10.298
for as much as an hour
after it went down.

30:12.369 --> 30:16.204
The sphere flies
into the Izvestkovaya Mountains

30:16.306 --> 30:17.205
and burns up.

30:17.307 --> 30:19.674
There is an explosion...

30:19.777 --> 30:21.576
and people want
to find out what happened,

30:21.678 --> 30:24.312
because I've read eyewitness
accounts-- incredible.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.984
Because of the huge
number of eyewitnesses,

30:29.086 --> 30:32.988
the crash became known
as the Russian Roswell.

30:33.090 --> 30:35.724
And like at Roswell,

30:35.826 --> 30:38.293
physical evidence
was recovered from the site,

30:38.395 --> 30:41.563
proving that a crash of some kind did,

30:41.665 --> 30:43.365
in fact, occur.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.568
Some local people and researchers

30:46.670 --> 30:48.303
managed to get to the site.

30:48.405 --> 30:52.674
They find very interesting
artifacts, remains.

30:54.711 --> 30:56.278
While officials

30:56.380 --> 30:58.980
dismissed the event
as a possible meteor crash,

30:59.082 --> 31:05.020
microscopic analysis of the
debris yielded unusual results.

31:05.122 --> 31:10.525
The samples contained a complex
system of woven metallic fibers;

31:10.627 --> 31:13.495
and the atomic structure
of the metal itself

31:13.597 --> 31:17.833
appeared to change when exposed to heat.

31:20.237 --> 31:22.370
When they melted the metal

31:22.472 --> 31:24.272
and put it to a spectrum analysis,

31:24.374 --> 31:27.175
the gold and silver
and other metals were gone.

31:28.812 --> 31:31.580
And instead, there was titanium

31:31.682 --> 31:33.748
and molybdenum there.

31:33.851 --> 31:37.619
And so, you have here,
some kind of metals,

31:37.721 --> 31:41.189
which apparently
are mutating into other metals.

31:41.291 --> 31:43.825
Which was very, very unusual.

31:45.395 --> 31:48.163
I think it's part of
some kind of machinery,

31:48.265 --> 31:50.432
nanotechnology machinery,

31:50.534 --> 31:53.034
but it wasn't made on planet Earth.

31:53.136 --> 31:54.703
It was later studied

31:54.805 --> 31:57.239
by a number of Soviet
scientific institutions

31:57.341 --> 32:00.542
and some of them said that
technology like this

32:00.644 --> 32:03.278
does not exist, uh, on Earth today.

32:03.380 --> 32:07.048
Subsequent to the Dalnegorsk crash,

32:07.150 --> 32:08.984
there have been a number of sightings

32:09.086 --> 32:10.652
in exactly the same area.

32:10.754 --> 32:13.922
Some people have even seen an object

32:14.024 --> 32:17.425
apparently land on the hillside

32:17.527 --> 32:19.527
where the first crash took place.

32:21.331 --> 32:24.099
Might the object
that crashed at Dalnegorsk,

32:24.201 --> 32:26.835
and was witnessed by hundreds of people,

32:26.937 --> 32:29.938
really have been an alien craft?

32:31.441 --> 32:33.942
Could the physical evidence left behind

32:34.044 --> 32:36.044
provide undeniable proof

32:36.146 --> 32:39.915
that otherworldly beings
are visiting planet Earth,

32:40.017 --> 32:44.586
and have been for thousands of years?

32:44.688 --> 32:48.790
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

32:48.892 --> 32:52.327
and believe that Russians have
had contact with aliens,

32:52.429 --> 32:54.362
not just here on Earth,

32:54.464 --> 32:58.233
but even in space.

33:02.973 --> 33:06.775
They describe
seeing seven angelic beings

33:06.877 --> 33:08.643
traveling alongside their spacecraft.

33:08.745 --> 33:12.013
Whatever it was they were witnessing,

33:12.115 --> 33:13.014
it was real.

33:13.116 --> 33:13.982
It was out there.

33:21.217 --> 33:23.384
Salyut 7 space station.

33:23.486 --> 33:27.454
July 12, 1984.

33:27.556 --> 33:31.358
Cosmonauts Oleg Atkov,

33:31.460 --> 33:33.360
Leonid Kizim,

33:33.462 --> 33:35.663
and Vladimir Solovyov,

33:35.765 --> 33:41.468
enter the 156th day
of their 237-day stay

33:41.570 --> 33:44.471
aboard Russia's scientific
research space station.

33:46.208 --> 33:50.511
To date, everything has gone
according to plan.

33:50.613 --> 33:52.246
But on this day,

33:52.348 --> 33:56.317
all three crewmembers
witness an extraordinary event.

33:59.088 --> 34:04.325
In 1984, Soviet cosmonauts
on board Salyut 7

34:04.427 --> 34:08.262
saw a strange orange glow

34:08.364 --> 34:11.165
around the spacecraft.

34:11.266 --> 34:16.370
And they saw what they thought,
at first, was maybe a gas leak.

34:16.472 --> 34:20.306
But it seemed that
the whole station was surrounded

34:20.409 --> 34:23.043
by this orange cloud.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.578
And as they looked at it,

34:24.679 --> 34:28.949
the cloud coalesced into a shape.

34:32.321 --> 34:36.991
Suddenly, they are all
blinded by this orange light.

34:38.260 --> 34:39.592
When they regain their vision,

34:39.695 --> 34:42.295
they look out the portals
of the spacecraft

34:42.398 --> 34:46.166
and they're astonished by what they see.

34:46.268 --> 34:50.437
They describe seeing
seven angelic beings

34:50.539 --> 34:53.306
that are traveling
alongside their spacecraft,

34:53.409 --> 34:55.876
and did so for ten minutes.

34:59.849 --> 35:03.117
The men described
huge, winged creatures,

35:03.219 --> 35:05.419
as much as 80 feet tall,

35:05.521 --> 35:08.722
that appeared to have glowing halos.

35:08.824 --> 35:14.194
Officials dismissed the incident
as a group hallucination

35:14.296 --> 35:16.764
resulting from oxygen deprivation

35:16.866 --> 35:19.533
and pressure fluctuations.

35:19.635 --> 35:21.769
Later that summer,

35:21.871 --> 35:25.506
three more cosmonauts
joined the Salyut 7 crew.

35:25.608 --> 35:31.045
All six of them, once again,
saw these winged beings.

35:31.147 --> 35:32.746
But how could all of these cosmonauts

35:32.848 --> 35:35.549
share one hallucination?

35:39.755 --> 35:43.090
It seems to me that
this was not hallucination,

35:43.192 --> 35:45.826
that whatever it was
they were witnessing,

35:45.928 --> 35:47.561
it was real. It was out there.

35:48.631 --> 35:50.464
Now, angels?

35:50.566 --> 35:51.799
Aliens?

35:51.901 --> 35:53.500
I don't know, but, uh,

35:53.602 --> 35:56.670
when one looks at the recurrence

35:56.772 --> 36:00.474
of winged figures in human history,

36:00.576 --> 36:04.511
in terms of religion,
in terms of culture, mythology.

36:04.613 --> 36:07.748
Are we looking at something real?

36:07.850 --> 36:10.417
Are these angels that we see

36:10.519 --> 36:13.220
actually extraterrestrial entities?

36:17.226 --> 36:18.692
Might the winged figures

36:18.794 --> 36:20.794
seen by the Salyut 7 crew,

36:20.896 --> 36:24.765
really have been extraterrestrials?

36:24.867 --> 36:27.935
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

36:28.037 --> 36:30.304
and suggest that similar sightings

36:30.406 --> 36:34.641
were secretly reported
by many Russian cosmonauts.

36:34.743 --> 36:38.011
Soviet cosmonauts
had a really interesting

36:38.114 --> 36:41.482
and challenging dilemma
when it came to truth telling.

36:41.584 --> 36:44.451
Because at the same time that
they were the public face

36:44.553 --> 36:46.487
of the Soviet space program,

36:46.589 --> 36:49.556
there was the always hidden goal
of the Soviet space program,

36:49.658 --> 36:51.024
which was to prove

36:51.127 --> 36:53.794
intercontinental ballistic
missile capability.

36:53.896 --> 36:57.131
So the cosmonauts were
publically to disguise

36:57.233 --> 36:59.399
those parts of the mission
that were secret

36:59.502 --> 37:01.468
and involved in national security,

37:01.570 --> 37:03.370
making it all that much more interesting

37:03.472 --> 37:06.340
when we try to assess what
they saw, when they talk about

37:06.442 --> 37:09.643
anomalous things that they
supposedly encountered in space.

37:09.745 --> 37:12.579
You have to understand
that many cosmonauts,

37:12.681 --> 37:16.750
even if they witnessed
something strange in space,

37:16.852 --> 37:22.923
were, um, highly reluctant
to openly talk about it,

37:23.025 --> 37:27.628
because of the concern
of being decommissioned

37:27.730 --> 37:29.763
for the reason of insanity.

37:29.865 --> 37:34.401
Indeed, some of the Soviet
and the Russian cosmonauts

37:34.503 --> 37:39.173
did have very strange experience
in space.

37:41.110 --> 37:42.676
Could strange encounters

37:42.778 --> 37:47.447
reported by Russian cosmonauts,
as well as military pilots,

37:47.550 --> 37:51.852
be connected to the artifacts
discovered in the Ural Mountains

37:51.954 --> 37:54.655
and the Dalnegorsk crash site?

37:54.757 --> 37:59.493
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe the answer can be found

37:59.595 --> 38:02.763
by examining not just
what the Russian cosmonauts

38:02.865 --> 38:04.298
have seen in space...

38:06.068 --> 38:07.568
but what they've heard.

38:15.369 --> 38:17.102
Ever since Yuri Gagarin

38:17.205 --> 38:20.506
became the first man
to reach space in 1961,

38:20.608 --> 38:22.975
cosmonauts,

38:23.077 --> 38:25.845
along with other astronauts
from around the world,

38:25.947 --> 38:31.150
have had visions and experiences
in space that defy explanation.

38:31.252 --> 38:34.320
Perhaps the most curious
among these incidents

38:34.422 --> 38:37.790
is what has become known
as the "space whisper."

38:39.260 --> 38:41.493
There's an anonymous cosmonaut,

38:41.596 --> 38:44.029
I think he's simply known
as Cosmonaut X,

38:44.131 --> 38:47.800
who allegedly talked about
an experience that he

38:47.902 --> 38:50.836
and another cosmonaut had
while they were in orbit.

38:50.938 --> 38:54.473
What this anonymous cosmonaut said,

38:54.575 --> 38:58.611
he heard, something speaking
to him inside his mind.

39:02.216 --> 39:06.452
Both apparently
heard this same whispering

39:06.554 --> 39:11.523
inside their heads,
a kind of telepathic message.

39:11.626 --> 39:14.360
This cosmic whisper

39:14.462 --> 39:17.963
said that they were his ancestors

39:18.065 --> 39:20.099
from the very distant past.

39:20.201 --> 39:25.004
They told him things about
his own family in the Urals

39:25.106 --> 39:27.806
that no one would have known.

39:27.909 --> 39:32.444
And they also told him that
they should go back to Earth.

39:32.546 --> 39:38.517
That Russia was not ready for
what they were attempting to do.

39:38.619 --> 39:41.954
And, in a sense, go back home and,

39:42.056 --> 39:43.822
you know, prepare yourself.

39:43.925 --> 39:46.458
There were more than one cosmonaut.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.360
Some of them knew not to report it

39:48.462 --> 39:50.696
because this would
eliminate their presence

39:50.798 --> 39:52.197
in the space program.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.466
But they talked among each other
when they could

39:54.568 --> 39:56.635
and they found out
that it was more than one person

39:56.737 --> 40:00.739
and in different spaceships,
that had been subjected to this.

40:00.841 --> 40:04.310
How could so many Russian cosmonauts

40:04.412 --> 40:06.845
have heard the same mysterious whisper

40:06.948 --> 40:09.048
while traveling through space?

40:09.150 --> 40:15.020
And just what was this celestial
voice trying to communicate?

40:15.122 --> 40:19.858
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe it is another example

40:19.961 --> 40:21.860
of extraterrestrial activity

40:21.963 --> 40:26.565
that is only now being disclosed.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.968
With all of the
massive secrecy in Russia

40:29.070 --> 40:31.537
and all of the things
we're just learning,

40:31.639 --> 40:34.673
it would seem to only be
the tip of the iceberg

40:34.775 --> 40:38.544
of the many visitations
of extraterrestrials

40:38.646 --> 40:41.580
that have been occurring
all over the world.

40:43.284 --> 40:45.150
There is a great wealth of information

40:45.252 --> 40:46.919
in the former Soviet Union.

40:47.021 --> 40:49.922
And when people in the west
find out more and more

40:50.024 --> 40:56.261
about events and observations
over Russia, they become amazed.

40:57.631 --> 40:59.098
If we were to get access

40:59.200 --> 41:01.667
to some of the Russian files
on extraterrestrials,

41:01.769 --> 41:06.071
it could answer some of
the questions that we have,

41:06.173 --> 41:08.474
because what if some of those stories

41:08.576 --> 41:12.211
corroborate the ones
that we're familiar with?

41:12.313 --> 41:15.314
Because then,
it could only mean one thing:

41:15.416 --> 41:18.717
we've all been visited
by the same visitors.

41:22.089 --> 41:23.455
Does the ultimate proof

41:23.557 --> 41:25.958
that extraterrestrials
have visited Earth

41:26.060 --> 41:28.560
exist within Russia?

41:28.662 --> 41:32.798
Could such information
have been purposely covered up?

41:32.900 --> 41:35.034
And if so,

41:35.136 --> 41:37.102
might the most compelling evidence

41:37.204 --> 41:40.339
still be under lock and key?

41:40.441 --> 41:44.610
Perhaps as more of Russia's
secret files are revealed,

41:44.712 --> 41:48.480
we will discover that hidden
within these vast archives,

41:48.582 --> 41:53.452
lies the truth about our alien origins.

41:54.305 --> 42:00.483
