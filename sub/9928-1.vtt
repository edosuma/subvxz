WEBVTT

00:30.760 --> 00:33.733
And you thought that was
just an old dead log lyin' there.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.644
I'll tell you, these gators are mean.
They're real.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.569
By the way, folks, you can get your own
genuine Florida baby alligator

00:38.640 --> 00:41.630
and other Sentinel souvenirs
at the concession stand in the lobby.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.938
Okay, you can get yourself
a genuine alligator

00:44.000 --> 00:45.136
at the stand back there.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.736
Those thick bodies are big, man.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.248
They could do without the fake blood.
It's real, Mama.

00:52.940 --> 00:54.078
All right, folks.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.689
Hit him! Get him!

00:57.760 --> 01:00.225
Why don't he shoot it?
If they could turn in on its back,

01:00.280 --> 01:01.293
it'll fall asleep.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.328
Stay calm, now.
We got everything under control.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.832
Don't worry about it.
We'll get him outta there.

01:07.900 --> 01:08.993
It's okay, folks.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.706
Well, now, we promised you
gator wrasslin', folks,

01:16.780 --> 01:18.437
and sometimes gators win.

01:18.500 --> 01:22.345
A big hand for Bobby Brazel, everybody.
Bobby Brazel.

01:22.420 --> 01:24.735
Attaboy, Bobby.
He'll be back on his feet next week, folks.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.100
Honey, they're vicious animals.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.921
Did you see what it did
to that man today?

01:34.920 --> 01:37.658
Oh, come on, honey.
It's starting to rain.

01:39.420 --> 01:40.660
What about when he grows up?

01:40.720 --> 01:41.961
I'll give it to a zoo.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.732
Pick yourself a cute one, honey.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.931
Go ahead.
They won't hurt you.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.540
They're tender little babies.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.543
Come on.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.135
There you go.
Wow.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.579
I'll call him Ramon.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.876
Isn't he cute?

01:56.940 --> 01:58.781
But come on.
Let's go, honey.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.722
Here's your house.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.059
Why don't you go in and go to bed now.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.530
'Cause I have to go to bed, too.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.897
When you get up, I'll be going to school,

02:14.960 --> 02:18.426
and you'll be taking
your alligator bus to school.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.200
And you'll be goin' to school here, and...

02:22.280 --> 02:24.743
there's all sorts of stuff that you'll like there.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.336
There's fish and crickets and insects.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.938
You'll love living here, Ramon.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.574
It's so fun.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.083
Oh, it's time to go to bed.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.851
<i>The city of Chicago
remains in chaos this morning.</i>

02:37.920 --> 02:40.136
<i>Hundreds of rioters disrupted the 1968...</i>
Where's Marisa?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.570
<i>Democratic convention...</i>
She's not home.

02:41.580 --> 02:43.472
<i>...clashing with Mayor Daley's
police force late last night.</i>

02:43.500 --> 02:44.428
Marisa!

02:44.500 --> 02:45.492
<i>Hundreds were injured...</i>
She is not home yet.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.897
Damn! Marisa!

02:46.960 --> 02:48.092
Oh, my God!

02:48.160 --> 02:49.226
Marisa!

02:49.300 --> 02:50.530
She's not home!

02:50.600 --> 02:52.434
Well, where the hell is she, then?

02:52.500 --> 02:55.440
She's at school, at the science fair.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.853
Now, what are you gonna do with it?
I'm gonna get rid of it!

02:57.880 --> 03:00.675
There's alligator turds
behind the clothes hamper!

03:00.740 --> 03:02.408
And what are you gonna tell Marisa?

03:02.480 --> 03:04.074
We'll tell her we found it dead

03:04.140 --> 03:05.640
like we did with the hamsters!

03:06.720 --> 03:07.811
No. Bill.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.151
We'll give him a burial at sea.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.584
All right, guys, sorry.

04:23.420 --> 04:25.363
I think we got him.

04:25.420 --> 04:26.625
What do you say there, kid?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.690
I know just what you're going through.

04:30.260 --> 04:31.965
What are you lookin' at?

04:32.040 --> 04:34.871
The patch on the back,
thinning on the front.

04:34.940 --> 04:35.839
You know what I mean?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.136
Same thing.
Same thing.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.234
You know?

04:38.300 --> 04:39.710
Yeah.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.610
Okay. what is it?
$15.90

04:42.920 --> 04:43.973
Had another one.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.427
They swiped him
out in front of a grocery store.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.476
I must've been in there
two minutes, and bingo.

04:47.540 --> 04:50.386
Yeah, that sure goes on
a lot around this neighborhood.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.083
Did you call the cops?

04:52.160 --> 04:53.352
I am the cops.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.460
Name was Snaps.
The one that got grabbed.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.328
I know just how you feel.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.130
They're kinda cute.
You...

05:03.200 --> 05:04.931
You kinda get attached to them, don't you?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.165
Yeah, you sure do.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.042
Oh, duty calls.
Well... Thank you.

05:13.900 --> 05:16.404
You got any advice on him?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.882
Keep your shoes off the floor
for a couple of months.

05:18.940 --> 05:20.418
He's teething.
Thanks.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.386
All right, kid.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.794
How do you suppose it got this way?

05:35.860 --> 05:37.301
Looks like it was chewed off.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.429
Yeah. It's a working man's hand.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.564
We'll get some scrapings
of these calluses.

05:44.180 --> 05:45.337
Anything else?

05:45.400 --> 05:47.345
Yeah. They found a Lhasa Apso

05:47.400 --> 05:49.210
floating in the same sludge tank.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.681
What is that, some kind of pooch?

05:50.740 --> 05:52.308
Yeah, some kind of dog.

05:52.380 --> 05:55.047
They got a line on who it might be.

05:56.860 --> 05:58.949
Yo! Homicide in here?

05:59.020 --> 06:00.151
Yeah, it's me.

06:00.220 --> 06:04.287
Chief wants you outside.
He's got a lady that owns a dog.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.298
I'll be right there.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.664
We got a big toe in the morgue once.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.999
Nothin' else. Just a big toe.
Yeah?

06:11.060 --> 06:12.298
Never found the rest of him.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.033
But we figured out who it was.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.870
Had a funeral and everything.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.506
Must've been a pretty small casket.
I checked it out.

06:21.580 --> 06:25.984
There's only three of that breed
registered in the whole state.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.146
Now, a lady called in
and reported it lost two months ago.

06:29.220 --> 06:30.712
What kind of shape's it in now?

06:30.780 --> 06:32.815
The body hasn't decomposed a bit,

06:32.880 --> 06:36.453
but all the internal organs
had been cut out clean as a whistle.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.292
Larynx cords cut, too.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.559
It looks so much like Taffy.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.066
You know...
Mrs. Lewis?

06:42.140 --> 06:44.399
Uh, this is Detective Madison.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.470
Hi.

06:45.500 --> 06:49.407
It looks exactly like Taffy,
but it's way too big.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.672
You know, she has the same markings,
the same color.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.042
Everything.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.979
This fit her two months ago
when I lost her.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.776
This sweater fit this dog?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.226
Come on.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.535
Get in there.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.306
See if you can make some friends.

07:37.380 --> 07:40.553
Come on, Tucker.
Here we go.

07:40.620 --> 07:44.062
I'm gonna need a lot more of those
for this experiment.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.563
How about some cats?

07:45.620 --> 07:47.895
I got plenty of cats.

07:47.960 --> 07:48.967
Puppies.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.002
I also got a parrot I'd like to get rid of.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.562
Puppies.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.200
And we're through with those.
You can dump 'em.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.300
Right.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.643
Oh, my God.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.721
Hey, you know,
a cop came by my store this morning.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.222
Almost wet my pants.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.916
I'm scared, you know.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.187
I'm really scared.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.623
Maybe I ought to...

08:18.700 --> 08:20.529
Maybe I ought to lay low for a while, huh?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.534
Gutchel, I need a lot more animals.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.695
The old man's breathin' down
my neck for results.

08:24.760 --> 08:25.862
Now, get cracking.

08:25.940 --> 08:26.938
Right.

08:28.040 --> 08:28.972
Puppies.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.406
Puppies.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.518
Callan?

08:41.320 --> 08:42.320
Yeah.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.770
They tell me you're a friend
of Edward Norton's?

08:45.820 --> 08:47.258
That's right.
So what?

08:47.320 --> 08:48.686
Well, his timecard for last Friday

08:48.720 --> 08:50.457
said that he punched out at 3:00,

08:50.520 --> 08:53.294
but his wallet and street clothes
are still in his locker.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.301
Yeah, well, I punched out for him.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.495
He's okay, isn't he?

08:57.560 --> 08:59.401
Where was the last place you saw him?

09:00.940 --> 09:02.567
Well, it must've been Friday.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.610
We were openin' up
a section of the old system

09:04.680 --> 09:06.372
down by the drug works there.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.697
You mangy little...

10:06.760 --> 10:09.172
Oh, don't you give me any trouble, now.

10:18.940 --> 10:20.816
Bastard.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.463
God.

11:21.540 --> 11:22.844
Not that bunch.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.849
Well...

11:26.340 --> 11:28.445
Not exactly the Nile...

11:28.520 --> 11:31.183
I gotta get you little suckers movin'!

11:34.660 --> 11:35.660
Come on!

11:39.860 --> 11:42.060
Don't want ya...

12:02.220 --> 12:04.246
You know, if this keeps up,

12:04.320 --> 12:06.848
I'm gonna open a spare parts shop.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.860
This isn't the guy the arm came from.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.054
How can you tell?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.063
This guy cut his nails square.
Yeah?

12:12.120 --> 12:13.496
The other one rounded 'em off.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.431
What was he wearin' on his feet?
Wearin' boots?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.993
No, he's wearin'
alligator wing tips with lifts in 'em.

12:19.060 --> 12:20.698
Not your regulation sewer gear.

12:20.760 --> 12:21.967
Well, we got one here.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.633
And... you know,

12:23.700 --> 12:26.337
forensic came up with something
very interesting in his sock.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.437
What?
Kitty litter.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.914
The guy must've been a cat fanatic.

12:38.260 --> 12:40.725
Yes, we do quite a bit of <i>in vivo</i> research.

12:40.780 --> 12:43.557
You ever do business
with a pet store owner named Gutchel?

12:45.560 --> 12:47.862
All of our subjects are either bred here,

12:47.920 --> 12:49.560
or we purchase them from the city pound.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.001
What happens when you run out
of test animals?

12:52.060 --> 12:55.063
We have to suspend research.
That does happen.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.133
You're a hormone guy, right?
Yes.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.941
Just hypothetically,
is it possible for a mature dog

13:02.000 --> 13:05.279
to double its size
in, say, a two-month period?

13:06.480 --> 13:08.316
No, not at the present time.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.184
Look, detective, I'd like to be
more help to you, but...

13:12.260 --> 13:14.522
like I said, when we're done
with the subjects,

13:14.580 --> 13:16.925
they're taken back to the pound
for cremation.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.397
It's all very carefully regulated
by the Humane Society.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.263
Is it possible for one of these dogs

13:22.320 --> 13:25.462
to get loose and wind up
in the sewer system?

13:25.540 --> 13:26.903
No.

13:28.540 --> 13:29.541
No way.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.745
Very quiet.

13:38.820 --> 13:39.750
Pardon?

13:39.820 --> 13:42.083
I say, your test animals are very quiet.

13:42.140 --> 13:46.454
Oh, yes. Well, we cut the larynx
when they first come in.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.050
It, uh... helps keep the noise level down.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.254
That it does.

13:55.020 --> 13:57.298
Stop tap-dancing around it, son.

13:59.340 --> 14:02.136
You just got caught
with your pants down, that's all.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.972
Well, we're very close
to that synthetic hormone, sir,

14:05.040 --> 14:06.421
and I thought that we should go ahead...

14:06.440 --> 14:09.437
Yes. What do the police really have on you?

14:09.520 --> 14:11.275
Well, Gutchel was paid
out of the slush fund,

14:11.320 --> 14:13.308
so there's no way
he can be tied to the company.

14:13.380 --> 14:16.411
I've disposed of any animals
that could be traceable.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.116
It's just this guy Madison that was here.
Yes, yes, yes.

14:19.180 --> 14:23.787
I'll put in the fix.
Pardon?

14:23.860 --> 14:25.207
It's not the police
we have to worry about.

14:25.220 --> 14:28.564
No, it's those damn yellow journalists
that's the trouble.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.693
They're out to ruin our public image.

14:30.760 --> 14:31.769
Yes, sir.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.465
Yes. Now, you get on back
to your chemistry set,

14:34.540 --> 14:36.633
and I'll take care of everything.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.734
We'll put in the fix.
Don't worry about a thing.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.743
Go on. Go on.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.836
Thank you, sir.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.882
Yes. And don't talk to any reporters.

14:45.220 --> 14:46.650
Yes, sir.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.430
I don't know why I'm supposed to talk to 'em.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.853
Because it's your case.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.152
You gotta face the music.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.953
Jesus, don't you own a razor?

14:54.020 --> 14:55.288
I was in a hurry this morning.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.990
In a hurry? For Christ sakes,
you were a half-hour late!

14:59.060 --> 15:00.759
I hate reporters.
They're assholes.

15:00.820 --> 15:03.199
You just watch your language in there!

15:03.260 --> 15:06.204
Edward Norton worked for
the Sanitation Department for 25 years.

15:06.260 --> 15:08.103
Have you identified the other victim?

15:08.160 --> 15:09.413
And what do you know about him?

15:09.480 --> 15:11.033
Luke Gutchel, he operated a pet store.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.340
And Gutchel. Doesn't he have
a criminal record?

15:13.400 --> 15:14.344
No comment.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.280
Detective, is there any evidence
to link the two murders?

15:17.340 --> 15:18.460
Well, we don't know that it was a murder.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.628
Second of all, that would be evidence.

15:19.640 --> 15:20.962
I wouldn't be able to comment on it.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.430
Is there anything you can comment on?

15:22.440 --> 15:23.682
Next question.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.747
What exactly did
you find in the sewer system?

15:25.820 --> 15:26.654
Say it again, please?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.204
How could the bodies have
found their way into the sewer system?

15:29.220 --> 15:32.857
In this city, we use a combination
sewage and drainage system.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.477
Therefore, the bodies could've found
their way into the system at any point.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.799
Can you give us
a cause of death in each case?

15:37.860 --> 15:39.098
The bodies were dismembered.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.649
We're waiting on the coroner's report.

15:40.660 --> 15:42.732
Can you tell us at least if they were similar?

15:42.800 --> 15:44.139
The bodies were dismembered.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.734
Are you withholding information?
No comment.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.246
Do you think there might be
a Jack-the-Ripper type killer

15:49.320 --> 15:50.373
operating in the city?

15:50.440 --> 15:52.974
It's a little too early to speculate
on that kind of...

15:53.040 --> 15:55.486
What do you think the motive
might've been in these slayings?

15:58.280 --> 16:00.290
Raise newspaper circulation.
Look, I can't do this.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.488
As you can see,

16:03.560 --> 16:06.224
we have very little
information at the moment.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.697
Now if you'll excuse us,

16:07.760 --> 16:10.030
Detective Madison and I have work to do.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.196
Officer Madison, aren't you the same
David Madison who lost his partner

16:13.260 --> 16:16.639
in the Hotel Baldwin incident in St. Louis?

16:16.700 --> 16:18.006
Yeah.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.137
I believe in that case, your partner
was stabbed to death, wasn't he?

16:23.240 --> 16:24.180
He was shot.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.807
That's right. I'm sorry.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.782
We will keep you posted.

16:30.860 --> 16:31.880
Thank you.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.939
You ought to let me
break that stolen pet angle.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.163
Give 'em somethin' to chew on.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.433
You look terrible, David.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.913
When you're representing the department,
you should take the time...

16:44.940 --> 16:46.281
Look, Chief, I had a tough night last night.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.083
I had one of those bad dreams.
Didn't give me much sleep.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.684
I didn't shave this morning,
so gimme a break.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.109
David, you can't let that Baldwin Hotel
thing throw you.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.477
Now, that was five years ago,
and nobody blames you.

16:56.540 --> 16:59.176
Yeah. Tell that to the newspapers.
Thanks.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.288
I need somebody
to check out a sewer with me.

17:12.359 --> 17:13.797
Champsky?

17:13.859 --> 17:16.164
I got a court appearance today.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.471
Meyer? Spinola?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.063
We're gonna mark that hill today.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.972
Don't think the Chief would pull us.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.943
Sloan, what are you doin?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.535
Paperwork.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.944
What is it, my breath?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.073
Shoot fingers or somethin'.
I need somebody.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.084
I'll go.

17:37.380 --> 17:38.879
You're it.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.187
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need
some boots or something.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.728
I just shined my shoes,
and I don't wanna get 'em wet.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.525
You bet.
You bet.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.656
You hit some methane pockets,

17:47.720 --> 17:48.859
these will help you.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.162
Righto.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.534
Who cuts your hair, Madison?

17:54.540 --> 17:56.667
I do... mostly. Why?

17:56.740 --> 17:58.437
You oughta see a hair stylist.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.410
You let your hair grow down

18:00.480 --> 18:02.071
and whip it across...

18:02.140 --> 18:03.910
nobody will be able to see it.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.280
Sir?

18:12.360 --> 18:13.289
Yeah?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.883
I killed a man in the sewer.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.360
Madison.

18:18.420 --> 18:19.430
You wish.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.988
Well, look, you give us a second,

18:21.060 --> 18:22.577
I'll take you down to Sergeant Reynolds.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.761
He'll take your confession.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.497
No, sir. I didn't come to confess.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.368
I came to...

18:27.440 --> 18:29.270
kill the rest of you.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.009
I see.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.942
How do you intend to do that?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.242
I'm wired to explode.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.340
You two.

18:38.420 --> 18:39.417
Don't move.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.182
Your time is running out.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.348
Now, I cut him up with my matte knife.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.517
I'm a picture framer.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.288
Why would you do it, son?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.828
They told me to.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.227
Who told you?

18:52.300 --> 18:53.457
Them.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.159
On the radio.

18:55.220 --> 18:58.135
Madison...he's bluffing.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.670
Take him to the left.

18:59.740 --> 19:00.932
Cool it, Kelly.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.839
Don't move!
I'll kill us all!

19:03.900 --> 19:05.604
They told me to.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.441
"On the radio, oh"

19:08.500 --> 19:09.572
"On the radio."

19:11.080 --> 19:13.278
Kid, take your finger
away from that button, please.

19:13.340 --> 19:14.614
Kelly!
They told me to.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.131
The voices. Don't you see?
Hey, buddy.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.089
The voices.
Buddy, you wanna know the truth?

19:18.160 --> 19:19.715
I used to be a left-hander.

19:19.780 --> 19:20.911
They made me a right-hander.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.257
I wanted to be a priest.
They made me into a cop.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.058
You wanna blow the joint up,
I don't care what you do.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.208
I stopped wantin' to be a cop

19:27.220 --> 19:28.563
about last week. I have...

19:29.640 --> 19:31.068
Don't even blink.

19:31.140 --> 19:33.127
Okay, what do I...
Don't do anything yet.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.749
Look on the side.
It's not on this side.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.285
There's gotta be a little button.
It's gotta be right near the counter.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.469
Got 11 seconds more.
Okay.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.501
All right.
Nine seconds more.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.219
Pull it.
I got it, I got it, I got it.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.893
Now, don't anybody move.
Hold him real tight.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.612
I got him.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.205
All right, let's see what we got here.

19:51.020 --> 19:52.285
It's a radio.

19:54.180 --> 19:56.457
Next time, try Lawrence Welk.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.725
Hey, Sloane with all the paperwork,
come here and book this guy.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.368
Okay.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.808
Did you see the look
on that guy's face?

20:11.880 --> 20:14.038
I want to know why
you thought he was bluffin'.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.342
Well, you can't live forever, huh?

20:16.420 --> 20:18.713
Ain't gonna last long
in the cops with that attitude.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.052
We'll see.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.518
Oh, boy.

20:25.060 --> 20:27.150
Look at this place!

20:40.400 --> 20:42.839
Heard you used to work in St. Louis.

20:44.100 --> 20:47.078
Yeah.
Why'd you leave?

20:50.440 --> 20:52.713
I'm sure you must've heard the story.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.887
All I heard was...

20:55.940 --> 20:59.048
kind of unhealthy to work with you.

21:02.760 --> 21:03.921
Then why'd you volunteer?

21:06.260 --> 21:08.859
I don't go for that locker room crap.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.731
Besides, I can take care of myself.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.292
Know what I mean?

21:17.440 --> 21:18.704
Well...

21:19.940 --> 21:21.845
I can't find him.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.210
I'm not surprised.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.408
These maps aren't complete.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.713
Some of these tunnels date back to 1890.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.810
They lose track.
Here you go.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.788
As long as we get home before supper.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.451
Oh, my back!

21:56.640 --> 21:58.843
Methane.
Use your mask.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.078
Don't light any matches.

22:04.380 --> 22:06.755
Saw a methane explosion in St. Louis once.

22:06.820 --> 22:08.292
Blew a hole in the street.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.157
Goddamn bus fell through.

22:10.220 --> 22:13.322
Well. At least we could
find our way outta here.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.351
Where are we?

22:34.520 --> 22:37.249
According to this...Cleveland.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.703
I knew a guy like you in St. Louis.

22:59.780 --> 23:01.473
Wild Billy, used to call him.

23:01.540 --> 23:03.571
He'd just kick a door in
and see what happened.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.377
We're down by the ballpark one time.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.474
You know St. Louis?

23:08.820 --> 23:09.820
Kelly?

23:12.460 --> 23:13.947
Kelly?

25:00.120 --> 25:02.599
You could've been shot, you asshole.

25:02.660 --> 25:05.033
I thought I was dealin' with
quick-draw Madison.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.263
Damn.

25:06.340 --> 25:08.272
What do you think?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.365
I think someones been here recently.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.434
Yeah. I think we ought
to come back here with a crew

25:13.500 --> 25:15.173
and really look this joint over.

25:28.680 --> 25:32.459
You know, Madison,
I don't mind tellin' you.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.795
I'm gettin' a little tired of this soup.

25:42.460 --> 25:44.601
Son of a bitch.

25:44.680 --> 25:46.473
Wait a minute.
I got it.

25:46.540 --> 25:49.139
Here you go.
Unroll it one more.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.545
That's it.
That's it.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.484
All right. Looks like...

25:54.540 --> 25:55.997
we just keep goin' down in this direction,

25:56.020 --> 25:57.581
we ought to hit some kind of an outlet.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.214
Get you home for dinner.

26:02.220 --> 26:03.717
I'm not hungry anymore.

26:38.920 --> 26:39.930
Come on.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.942
Keep movin'.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.568
Open it.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.044
It's stuck.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.843
Push!

27:00.840 --> 27:02.114
All the way up!
I am up.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.723
No!

27:07.780 --> 27:08.884
Oh, Lord!

27:08.960 --> 27:10.484
No!

27:15.400 --> 27:17.163
No!

27:18.960 --> 27:19.994
Kelly?

27:27.180 --> 27:28.178
Kelly!

27:42.380 --> 27:45.329
No! No.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.457
Oh, there you are.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.228
How'd I get here?

27:50.300 --> 27:52.929
Well, you just popped out
of a manhole at Campbell Street

27:53.000 --> 27:55.996
and started yelling "alligator".

27:56.060 --> 27:58.338
Holy Jesus.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.174
Kelly.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.838
Kelly.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.130
Hey. Hey, hey.
You are not to get...

28:23.200 --> 28:24.498
David...
Leave me alone.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.946
What happened to Kelly?
Did you find him?

28:25.960 --> 28:28.268
Nothing. And not a sign
of you know what, either.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.364
Now look, stay a couple of days.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.442
Just take it easy.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.586
What the hell are you talking about?

28:32.600 --> 28:33.872
We gotta get back down there.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.435
You need some rest, David.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.639
Are you nuts?

28:36.720 --> 28:38.307
You think I'm going to lay in this bed

28:38.380 --> 28:41.216
while a kid I sent down in the sewer
is...unaccounted for?

28:41.280 --> 28:42.686
Look, Dr. Leigh has got to see him.

28:42.740 --> 28:44.312
Who's this Dr. Leigh?

28:44.380 --> 28:46.152
He's a psychiatrist.

28:46.220 --> 28:47.535
He just wants to give you some tests.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.924
I'll give you some tests.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.756
You're going to give yourself a headache.

28:50.820 --> 28:52.606
What the hell's the matter with you guys?
Hi.

28:52.620 --> 28:54.461
How you feeling?

28:54.520 --> 28:56.932
What happened,
you lose your paper route?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.798
What's the matter with you?

28:58.860 --> 29:00.314
Hey, I'm just trying to write a story.

29:00.340 --> 29:03.068
Well, invent something.
You know how to do that.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.871
I hear you lost another partner.

29:05.940 --> 29:07.707
We got no comment on that.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.077
You know, that's getting
to be a habit with you.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.193
I pulled out the files
on the Baldwin Hotel shooting.

29:12.220 --> 29:14.583
Hey, Kemp...lay off.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.779
I'll lay off.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.666
You tell me what happened
in the sewer yesterday.

29:18.680 --> 29:19.748
No comment.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.189
Chief...

29:21.260 --> 29:22.988
I'm not asking you.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.688
I'm asking Officer Madison.

29:24.760 --> 29:28.164
And that's exactly what
We're going to find out, isn't it, Chief?

29:28.220 --> 29:29.393
Right.

29:32.100 --> 29:35.072
The largest one ever recorded
was around 15 feet,

29:35.140 --> 29:38.166
but in a sewer it's not possible.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.870
Even in a zoo they don't grow full size.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.775
He was bigger than that.

29:41.840 --> 29:42.846
Excuse me.

29:42.880 --> 29:43.881
He was huge.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.816
Tell me something, miss.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.217
Are these your snakes?

29:49.280 --> 29:51.778
No, they belong to the university.

29:51.860 --> 29:54.324
I have a couple of non-poisonous
species at home, though.

29:54.380 --> 29:55.859
It was bigger than 15 feet.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.328
An alligator half that size
would starve in a week.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.762
There's no sunlight.

30:00.820 --> 30:03.357
There are toxic fluids and gases.

30:03.420 --> 30:06.870
Not to mention the question
of how it got there in the first place.

30:06.940 --> 30:09.065
You're looking at the one who saw it,

30:09.140 --> 30:10.232
and it was big.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.375
You said it was dark.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.968
Now, perhaps you're mistaken.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.742
Okay.

30:17.820 --> 30:19.340
Thanks very much for you help.

30:19.420 --> 30:20.509
Can I borrow this book?

30:20.580 --> 30:22.314
You can have it.

30:23.860 --> 30:25.379
Excuse me.

30:25.460 --> 30:29.893
Dr. Kendall, could there be
another animal down there

30:29.960 --> 30:33.522
that could possibly be this size?

30:33.600 --> 30:37.056
Nothing I know of.
I'm sorry.

30:37.140 --> 30:39.035
Thank you very much.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.401
I thought she'd be some kind of help.

30:42.460 --> 30:44.373
She's the leading authority.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.069
Now, it was worth a try.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.634
She's a kid.
She lives with snakes.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.043
What the hell you talking about?

30:49.100 --> 30:50.512
I didn't say she was normal.

30:50.580 --> 30:54.040
I said she had the word on alligators.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.983
Look, why don't you give it up, Dave?

30:56.040 --> 30:57.214
It's one of your nightmares.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.313
Nightmare your ass.
There's something down there.

30:59.380 --> 31:02.484
Now, it'll take a lot of guys,
but we'll flush him out.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.155
The only thing you're going to take
is a leave of absence.

31:06.220 --> 31:08.859
Here. Read it and weep.

31:08.920 --> 31:12.528
Our friend Kemp, he's got the hots for you.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.765
"City Detective Loses Partner Again."

31:14.840 --> 31:17.569
"Mysterious circumstances
surround the abrupt disappearance

31:17.640 --> 31:19.940
"in a city sewer
of Police Patrolman Jim Kelly,

31:20.000 --> 31:23.640
"partner of Detective David Madison,

31:23.720 --> 31:26.047
"No such mystery

"of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police

31:27.680 --> 31:31.348

31:31.420 --> 31:35.222
"Witnesses report that
Detective Madison's inaction

"enabled the three to excape,

"In the more recent disappearance..."

31:47.800 --> 31:49.432
Hey, guys.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.610
Nice.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.562
"...the more recent disappearance,

32:12.620 --> 32:15.929
"city officials have been
unwilling to make any comment.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.094
This reporter, for one, is not satisfied."

32:19.160 --> 32:20.569
What kind of dreams?

32:20.640 --> 32:23.368
He was out on meds
most of the time that he was here.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.601
What are meds?

32:24.680 --> 32:25.676
Medication.

32:25.740 --> 32:27.143
He kept coming up with some garbage

32:27.200 --> 32:30.146
about alligators in the sewers.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.648
Alligators? In the sewers?

32:32.720 --> 32:33.945
Yeah.

32:45.900 --> 32:48.866
Nice. Wonderful place.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.006
Jesus Christ.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.931
No!

34:37.000 --> 34:39.442
No! No!

35:06.600 --> 35:08.435
Marisa Kendall?

35:13.500 --> 35:14.910
Hello.

35:14.980 --> 35:17.140
No, I was awake.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.581
Wait a minute.
Slow down.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.845
Kemp?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.648
No.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.053
Yeah, I'll be right there.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.785
Here's his camera.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.384
It got caught in a grate by tank five.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.326
Sure.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.829
And no sign of Kemp?

35:33.900 --> 35:37.061
The sanitation people,
they won't go in any further.

35:37.140 --> 35:39.467
The rumor is starting to spread.

35:39.540 --> 35:41.562
Figures.
Get 'em while they're hot.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.129
Got anything good, Sparks?

35:44.440 --> 35:46.967
You won't believe it.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.602
It's a rat.
No, no.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.909
Not that. Not that.
Here, look.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.021
Holy shit!

35:59.080 --> 36:01.285
What do you think, Chief?
You believe me now?

36:01.360 --> 36:03.589
We'll get the snake lady to take a look.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.629
Who?
The herpetologist.

36:05.700 --> 36:09.359
Imagine, clicking away with your camera
while that's coming at you.

36:09.420 --> 36:12.095
Well, he'll make the front page anyway.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.180
That's all he really wanted.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.399
Thomas Kemp, the popular columnist

36:15.460 --> 36:19.000
for The National Probe magazine
is missing and presumed dead.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.670
His camera, the only clue
to his disappearance,

36:21.740 --> 36:23.407
was fished out of a filtration tank

36:23.480 --> 36:25.540
at the city sewage works late last night.

36:25.620 --> 36:28.380
The film inside the camera
was salvaged.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.977
...what appeared to be
an abnormally large alligator

36:31.060 --> 36:33.182
or similar reptile who is now believed

36:33.260 --> 36:35.623
to be responsible
for at least four deaths.

36:35.680 --> 36:37.593
But as mayor,
I tell you that no effort

36:37.660 --> 36:40.460
and no expense will be spared by this...

36:40.520 --> 36:44.228
Professor, herpetologist, author,
and probably the leading authority

36:44.300 --> 36:46.736
here in the Midwest
on reptile and amphibian life,

36:46.800 --> 36:49.068
as well as a native of our own city.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.870
Dr. Kendall, what animal is it?

36:51.940 --> 36:54.468
It's an alligator.
Couldn't it be a...

36:54.540 --> 36:56.089
There's no question.
It's definitely an alligator.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.239
I see.

36:57.320 --> 36:58.680
How large do you think it is

36:58.740 --> 36:59.993
from the photographs you've seen?

37:00.020 --> 37:01.382
If it's been living in the sewer,

37:01.440 --> 37:02.851
it couldn't be very large.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.150
Even under ideal circumstances,
in a zoo for example,

37:05.220 --> 37:08.386
they don't grow nearly as large
as they would in their natural habitat.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.324
This makes it 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

37:19.240 --> 37:20.966
13,14...

37:24.600 --> 37:26.941
Where are you?

38:03.800 --> 38:06.044
Come on! How many?

38:06.120 --> 38:09.917
Come on with me.
Move it!

38:09.980 --> 38:11.818
Move it!

38:25.340 --> 38:26.360
Unit, come in.

38:26.440 --> 38:27.461
That you, Beau?

38:27.540 --> 38:28.562
Yeah. Who's this?

38:28.640 --> 38:29.833
This is Frank.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.465
Oh, you in position?
Yeah.

38:31.540 --> 38:34.010
Unit, come in.
Who's this?

38:34.080 --> 38:38.344
We've got teams moving in
from every possible entry point

38:38.420 --> 38:42.546
pushing through, converging
in these three main channels

38:42.620 --> 38:44.781
such that there is only
one possible exit,

38:44.860 --> 38:45.879
and that is here.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.617
What if he doesn't run?
Don't worry.

38:47.680 --> 38:48.818
It will.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.861
Oh, Dr. Kendall.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.488
If you don't corner it, you'll be fine.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.895
Detective Madison.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.227
Who invited her?

38:56.300 --> 38:58.345
David, we don't know
how this thing is going to react.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.927
Maybe she can help us.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.733
All units are in position now.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.330
Thank you.
Patch me in, please.

39:05.780 --> 39:07.334
This is Madison.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.242
Yo, this is Rudy.
We're all ready.

39:09.300 --> 39:14.751
Look, I didn't believe you,
and... I'm sorry.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.185
Don't lose any sleep over it.
We're all ready in here.

39:17.240 --> 39:18.687
All right, guys, this is Madison.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.121
Commence operation.

39:20.180 --> 39:21.501
Command Center, this is Unit One.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.525
We're pushing off.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.425
Unit Two pushing off.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.226
This is Unit Three pushing off.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.426
Madison, this is Harry.
I'm still waiting for Clark.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.331
I can't raise him on my radio.
Will you try him for me?

40:03.400 --> 40:06.529
...ends about a quarter-mile
downstream of the waterfall.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.970
Come in, Madison.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.303
I'm still waiting for Clark.
I can't raise him.

40:11.380 --> 40:12.501
Call him for me, will you?

40:12.580 --> 40:14.976
Madison? Madison!

40:43.660 --> 40:45.141
I don't know what's happened,

40:45.200 --> 40:47.109
but I passed the same spot three times now.

40:47.180 --> 40:50.306
Charlie 6, you're just going to
have to back up about 200 yards,

40:50.380 --> 40:52.474
make a southwest
and then a southerly turn.

40:52.540 --> 40:54.415
This is Clark...

40:54.480 --> 40:56.350
You know, I had one once when I was little.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.820
An alligator.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.914
My father found it dead one day, though,

41:00.980 --> 41:02.959
so I didn't get to keep it very long.

41:03.020 --> 41:04.119
His name was Ramon.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.760
Actually, they're not very good pets.

41:09.820 --> 41:11.267
Snakes are a lot better.

41:11.340 --> 41:12.996
You're a weird kid, you know that?

41:13.060 --> 41:14.697
I'm not a kid.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.172
Anybody younger than me is a kid.

41:18.980 --> 41:22.104
I'm really sorry about your friend.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.147
Must have been a terrible thing to see.

41:49.060 --> 41:52.167
Madison, Charlie 3 just called in from here.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.963
They'll be flushing him out
in five minutes.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.605
Yeah, if he's still in there.
Where is he going to go?

41:56.680 --> 41:58.773
Where did he come from,
that's what I'd like to know.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.840
Oh, Mayor, this is David Madison.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.182
He's heading up the operation.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.121
Hunker down, guys.
Here she comes.

42:06.180 --> 42:08.090
Ready positions, let's go!

42:09.120 --> 42:10.787
Into positions!

42:48.560 --> 42:50.329
Hold your fire!

42:51.940 --> 42:54.530
Hold your fire!

43:08.320 --> 43:09.581
David.

43:09.640 --> 43:10.847
We'd better go figure out

43:10.920 --> 43:12.566
what we're gonna hand
the press on this one.

43:12.580 --> 43:13.800
They missed it, Chief.
I don't know how, but...

43:13.820 --> 43:15.189
it's still in there.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.386
Come on, David.
Let's get the hell outta here.

43:22.700 --> 43:24.210
Chief Clark, can you
tell us what happened...

43:24.220 --> 43:25.724
Nothing!
Nothing to say.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.327
Press conference in the morning.

43:56.220 --> 44:01.364
Come on!
Come on, will ya?

44:01.440 --> 44:02.598
Let's go! Come on!

44:07.240 --> 44:08.404
Batter up!

44:36.740 --> 44:38.230
That's the one on the TV!

44:48.920 --> 44:50.887
Let's get out of here!
Come on! Let's go!

45:34.200 --> 45:36.564
Please help me!
Please help me!

45:50.680 --> 45:52.649
Help! Help!

45:54.480 --> 45:56.544
Mom!

45:59.520 --> 46:00.683
Mom! Mom!

46:00.760 --> 46:01.986
It's the alligator!

46:02.060 --> 46:03.470
It's the alligator!
It's the alligator!

46:03.480 --> 46:05.271
Later! I'm on the phone!
But it's the alligator!

46:05.300 --> 46:07.058
I said later!

46:07.120 --> 46:10.430
I'm sorry, Connie.
The kids are outside playing "Alligator,"

46:10.500 --> 46:12.662
and Joey's drivin' me batty.

46:12.740 --> 46:14.135
Yeah, where was I?
Oh, yeah...

46:14.200 --> 46:16.149
Joey, come back here!
Now he's got my bread knife!

46:16.160 --> 46:18.004
Joey! He's drivin' me crazy!

46:46.560 --> 46:49.164
Will you put that goddamn map away?

46:49.240 --> 46:52.606
Look, I gave you 78 men!
You've got the National Guard!

46:52.680 --> 46:54.803
And he's still loose in my city!

46:54.880 --> 46:56.277
Look at the hole he made!

46:56.340 --> 46:58.177
He'll go for water.
What?

46:58.240 --> 47:00.193
He'll go for water.
He's expended a lot of energy.

47:00.220 --> 47:02.082
He'll look for a place with water to rest.

47:02.140 --> 47:03.483
That's wonderful!

47:03.540 --> 47:05.522
We got rivers!
We got canals!

47:05.580 --> 47:07.113
And we got that lake over there!

47:12.160 --> 47:15.154
The safety of the public is my job!

47:15.220 --> 47:18.326
Well, you've got no job
unless I get reelected.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.547
Now, look. This could generate
a lot of good publicity.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.766
And I can't have your people
fumble the ball for us.

47:22.840 --> 47:23.966
And that's all.

47:24.040 --> 47:25.872
Give this lady an idea of how big he was.

47:25.940 --> 47:27.570
Just a guess.

47:27.640 --> 47:29.805
Was it as big as he is?

47:29.880 --> 47:32.474
You know an El Dorado?
The car. You're kidding.

47:32.540 --> 47:34.574
No, a refrigerator.
Of course a car!

47:34.640 --> 47:38.314
Wait a minute.
You're saying it was as big as a car?

47:38.380 --> 47:40.879
Yeah. Of course, you've gotta add the tail.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.687
Of course.

47:51.700 --> 47:53.567
Look at the size of this thing.

47:57.840 --> 47:59.468
This is amazing.

47:59.540 --> 48:01.272
I mean, according to this,

48:01.340 --> 48:02.972
it should be 30 to 40 feet long.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.411
But it is an alligator.

48:06.340 --> 48:07.544
David!

48:09.120 --> 48:10.780
This is Colonel Brock...

48:13.480 --> 48:15.390
Hey, what the hell is that?

48:15.460 --> 48:17.154
We're setting off charges

48:17.220 --> 48:18.427
to see if we can bring him up.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.294
It's a wild animal, not a submarine.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.829
I've flown in Colonel Brock

48:25.900 --> 48:28.303
to take charge of the operation.
Take charge?

48:28.360 --> 48:30.772
Yeah, well, he's hunted
big game animals all over the world.

48:32.280 --> 48:33.937
It's a new ballgame, Dave.

48:36.140 --> 48:37.738
What the hell do you expect me to do?

48:37.800 --> 48:39.941
You just stay out from under my feet.

48:45.480 --> 48:49.220
Start right now, guys.
Now, look, Madison...

48:49.280 --> 48:52.091
You know, it's not his fault
the alligator got loose.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.062
Who is this...pretty girl?

48:55.200 --> 48:57.792
Oh, Colonel Brock.
This is Dr. Kendall.

48:57.860 --> 49:01.429
She's the...
Oh, yes. The lizard lady.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.871
Well, now you can
go back to your books.

49:03.940 --> 49:06.273
You'd better take
all the help you can get.

49:06.340 --> 49:08.021
You know, I've seen
what this animal can do.

49:08.040 --> 49:10.673
Well, if I couldn't get
myself killed chasing it,

49:10.740 --> 49:12.078
what fun would it be?

49:14.420 --> 49:16.181
Get your Alexander souvenir here.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.619
Hey, how 'bout that?
Alexander souvenirs.

49:18.680 --> 49:20.088
Alexander souvenirs.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.920
How about you, bud?
An Alexander for ya?

49:21.980 --> 49:23.112
Take one home to the kiddie.

49:27.820 --> 49:29.230
Come and get your alligators.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.357
How 'bout you, pal?

49:30.420 --> 49:32.129
Won't take a bite out of your pocket...

49:32.200 --> 49:33.669
Hey! Aren't you gonna get one, pal?

49:33.740 --> 49:35.227
Hey, see him shake!
See him wiggle!

49:35.300 --> 49:36.738
Take him home!
Make ya giggle!

49:36.800 --> 49:38.968
Get 'em! Alligators!
Get 'em, pal! Get 'em, pal!

49:39.040 --> 49:40.441
Hey, sport.
Wanna see somethin?

49:42.600 --> 49:43.943
He's yours for twenty.

49:46.140 --> 49:47.844
Great pet for the kids.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.716
Feed him whatever's left on the table,
throw some water on him, huh?

49:50.780 --> 49:52.721
Couple of sausages...
Ross. Daley.

49:52.780 --> 49:54.313
Yeah, what's up?

49:54.380 --> 49:56.382
Bust this guy.
C'mon. What for?

49:56.460 --> 49:57.688
For being a creep.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.921
Possession of an endangered
species, anything you like.

49:59.960 --> 50:02.693
This is an attack on
the free enterprise system!

50:02.760 --> 50:03.790
Communist!

50:07.200 --> 50:09.695
Hi. Are we live on this thing?
I believe so.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.400
Oh, nice. You're very pretty.
But, uh...

50:11.480 --> 50:13.500
We're here to talk about alligators.

50:13.580 --> 50:16.910
Well, look.
Alligators respond to sound.

50:16.980 --> 50:19.175
They talk to each other.

50:19.240 --> 50:21.149
Call each other.

50:21.220 --> 50:22.515
Listen.

50:27.620 --> 50:29.091
What's that?

50:29.160 --> 50:30.854
That's the distress call

50:30.920 --> 50:32.705
of a young gator that's still with its mother.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.061
Do they have a love call?

50:35.120 --> 50:39.159
Your alligator is a very romantic creature.

50:39.240 --> 50:41.534
It gets the itch, come spring...

50:41.600 --> 50:43.732
and it'll give off a sound something like this...

50:50.780 --> 50:53.215
And that will attract another alligator?

50:53.280 --> 50:55.274
Well, I'm hoping so.

50:55.340 --> 50:56.649
I'm counting on it.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.119
I work, too, you know.

50:58.180 --> 50:59.849
I mean, I'm way behind on the class work.

50:59.920 --> 51:01.634
I still have two experiments
I have to get done...

51:01.660 --> 51:03.990
My dear young woman,
it is still out there.

51:04.060 --> 51:05.688
They'll find it.

51:05.760 --> 51:07.340
And your great white hunter will shoot it.

51:07.360 --> 51:08.661
And that'll be the end of it.

51:08.720 --> 51:10.892
And you're not even
curious how it got to be that size.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.902
I'll be there at the autopsy.

51:12.960 --> 51:15.665
Look. There's a couple
of things I'm trying to put together.

51:15.740 --> 51:18.799
You're the only I know
who can tell me whether the pieces fit.

51:18.880 --> 51:20.399
If the thing works out,

51:20.480 --> 51:22.104
I'll buy you an iguana or something.

51:22.180 --> 51:23.259
One of them little pretty...

51:25.520 --> 51:26.539
That'd be great.

51:27.980 --> 51:31.545
It's a section from the pituitary
of your Lhasa Apso.

51:31.620 --> 51:34.715
The dark blue globules
indicate that it's been bombarded

51:34.780 --> 51:36.782
with some sort of hormone derivative.

51:36.860 --> 51:38.225
What'll that do?

51:38.300 --> 51:41.321
Well, in some cases,
it'll make little dogs into big dogs.

51:41.400 --> 51:43.457
I'll put my money on somatropin,

51:43.520 --> 51:45.878
but if they've been throwing test animals
down the sewer for years,

51:45.900 --> 51:49.360
there's no telling what combination
our friend's been exposed to.

51:49.440 --> 51:52.602
Maybe he'll die of cancer.

52:43.720 --> 52:45.957
Jesus!

52:46.020 --> 52:47.929
He's a big one!
What is it?

52:48.000 --> 52:50.262
Alligator spoor!
Don't step in it!

52:51.960 --> 52:54.596
The latest sighting was in
the Marquette Hill section of the city,

52:54.660 --> 52:57.003
Where the animal is believed
to be still at large.

52:57.060 --> 52:59.803
Residents are warned to stay off the streets,

52:59.880 --> 53:03.039
and are asked to report any new sightings
of the alligator immediately.

53:29.060 --> 53:31.233
And you worked with progesterone as well?

53:31.300 --> 53:32.832
Sure. We tested 'em all.

53:32.900 --> 53:34.206
What kind of a cow is this?

53:34.280 --> 53:36.108
It's a calf.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.044
Big for a calf.

53:38.100 --> 53:40.048
Detective, the world has
a food shortage problem.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.016
We're trying to do something about that.

53:42.080 --> 53:44.076
Yes, I understand you manufactured

53:44.140 --> 53:46.247
a synthetic form of testosterone.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.348
Yes, we had some success with that.

53:48.420 --> 53:49.687
Why didn't you market it?

53:49.760 --> 53:51.454
Several contraindications.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.239
Main one being that it
tended to hyper-excite

53:53.260 --> 53:54.890
the organism's metabolic rate.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.263
What's that, in plain English?

53:57.320 --> 53:59.802
It gave them an insatiable appetite.

54:01.360 --> 54:03.498
Look. Detective.
I've got a lot of work to do.

54:03.560 --> 54:06.269
You got any more questions?
Yeah.

54:06.340 --> 54:09.039
What would Slade Pharmaceutical
pay for a hot Lhasa Apso?

54:13.380 --> 54:16.375
Mayor. Slade here.

54:16.440 --> 54:19.513
We got a little problem here at the lab
that you could be some help with.

54:20.660 --> 54:22.386
Chief!

54:22.460 --> 54:24.427
Chief.

54:24.480 --> 54:25.893
I got the goods on the alligator.

54:25.960 --> 54:28.157
David...
The big guy over at Slade's,

54:28.220 --> 54:29.755
our dear mayor's buddy,

54:29.820 --> 54:31.926
is up to his eyeballs in it.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.061
I'll need your shield, David.

54:34.140 --> 54:35.798
You're off the force.

54:35.860 --> 54:37.965
What are you talkin' about?

54:38.040 --> 54:40.009
You pushed too far.

54:40.080 --> 54:43.568
You didn't really expect me
to work under that guy Brock, did ya?

54:43.640 --> 54:45.410
It's out of my hands.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.917
You're kidding...
Homicide?

54:55.720 --> 54:57.488
Not anymore.

55:59.660 --> 56:00.656
I got canned.

56:00.680 --> 56:03.181
Apparently, we stepped on
all the wrong toes.

56:03.260 --> 56:04.283
Well, can they do that?

56:04.360 --> 56:05.953
Sure, they can do that.
It's their town.

56:06.020 --> 56:07.587
They can do anything they want.

56:07.660 --> 56:09.256
Well, how do you feel?

56:09.320 --> 56:11.332
I was always worried they
were gonna can me anyway.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.893
Now that it happened,
I feel wonderful.

56:13.960 --> 56:15.164
And what are you gonna do?

56:17.300 --> 56:19.502
Go out there.
I'm gonna find that alligator, and...

56:20.900 --> 56:22.400
I'm gonna kick his ass.

56:24.240 --> 56:25.612
When do we start?

56:26.220 --> 56:27.945
You ever have any boyfriends?

56:28.020 --> 56:31.180
There was Stuart, who was
president of the science club.

56:31.240 --> 56:32.619
Taught himself calculus?

56:32.680 --> 56:34.520
In the ninth grade.

56:34.580 --> 56:36.616
And then, of course, there was Chester.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.888
He was into reptiles, like I was.

56:38.960 --> 56:40.054
Sounds cozy.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.597
Oh, it was all right.

56:41.660 --> 56:43.996
Till he started dissecting me.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.101
Yeah, here we are.

56:48.160 --> 56:49.570
This place?

56:49.640 --> 56:51.038
Right-o.

56:51.100 --> 56:52.699
Jesus, I haven't been in this place

56:52.780 --> 56:54.420
since I first started with the department.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.877
Look at all that.

56:55.940 --> 56:58.505
This is where we're gonna
split up and take a look.

56:58.580 --> 57:00.776
What the hell are we looking for?

57:00.840 --> 57:03.512
Anything that looks
like it doesn't belong here.

57:03.580 --> 57:06.180
Evidence of alligator nesting.

57:06.260 --> 57:08.781
That would be,
like, shoes, handbags, luggage.

57:08.860 --> 57:09.916
Right.

57:19.260 --> 57:22.397
Found a shopping cart up here.

57:48.820 --> 57:50.026
You all right?

57:50.100 --> 57:51.498
Yeah, I'm fine.

57:51.560 --> 57:52.933
It's just a dog.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.333
Jesus.

57:54.400 --> 57:58.340
I'd venture to say there are other animals
stashed around here, too.

57:58.400 --> 58:01.605
I think this is home base.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.703
And you think he'll try to come back here?

58:03.780 --> 58:05.475
If it can get back into the system,

58:05.540 --> 58:06.708
I think it will sure try.

58:06.780 --> 58:08.842
Well, that settles it for me.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.216
I'm taking my vacation
till this thing's over with.

58:11.280 --> 58:15.018
At least in Florida, they keep 'em
in the swamps where they belong.

58:15.080 --> 58:18.390
Mr. Slade, I'd have to go
to the City Council for a reward.

58:18.460 --> 58:19.723
Now, now, let's stop fussing.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.128
I'll put up the money.
I'll put up the money.

58:22.200 --> 58:23.375
Listen, the wedding is tomorrow.

58:23.400 --> 58:26.766
I want you to pick up all this silver,
all the tables,

58:26.840 --> 58:28.929
put 'em back the way it should be later.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.597
That's very generous of you, Mr. Slade.

58:30.660 --> 58:33.972
Mayor, listen,
we have got four products...

58:34.040 --> 58:35.340
Four products...

58:35.400 --> 58:38.744
Pending with the Food and Drug
Administration right now... four products.

58:38.820 --> 58:41.340
And that's a lot of politics involved.

58:41.420 --> 58:43.977
I see. And if they traced it back
to the company...

58:44.040 --> 58:45.782
If they traced it back here to us?

58:45.860 --> 58:48.085
Yeah.
You'd be out of a job for one thing.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.853
Arthur.

58:50.920 --> 58:54.727
Mayor Ledeux-
My future son-in-law, Arthur Hill.

58:54.800 --> 58:56.890
Oh, how do you do?
Nice to meet you.

58:56.960 --> 58:58.627
Arthur is my number 1 boy.

58:59.700 --> 59:03.365
My number 1 boy, yes, sir.

59:04.900 --> 59:05.908
Dinner time.

59:06.980 --> 59:08.534
Aw, yes, kiddo, yes.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.476
Can I get rid of this jacket somewhere?

59:10.540 --> 59:11.673
Sure.
Drop it right there.

59:11.740 --> 59:12.806
This is Snaps.

59:12.880 --> 59:13.974
How do you do?

59:14.040 --> 59:15.461
Marisa. Okay, kiddo, are you hungry?

59:15.480 --> 59:17.112
Can I use your phone?

59:17.180 --> 59:18.346
Yeah. Right here.

59:18.420 --> 59:19.854
Thank you.

59:19.920 --> 59:21.618
What do you think, kid?
You hungry?

59:21.680 --> 59:24.182
Little bit of corned beef hash?

59:24.260 --> 59:26.387
Hello.
Hello, Mom?

59:26.460 --> 59:27.861
I'm going to be late tonight.

59:27.920 --> 59:31.230
Here you go.
That's it.

59:31.300 --> 59:32.495
Tonight's a school night.

59:32.560 --> 59:35.003
Now, what about your homework?
Mom, I'm the teacher.

59:35.060 --> 59:37.005
I made this nice meatloaf for you.

59:37.060 --> 59:38.301
It's so good.

59:38.360 --> 59:39.774
Listen, I ironed your white blouse.

59:39.800 --> 59:42.403
I can't find that little purple skirt
that goes with it.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.070
Now, what did I do with that?

59:44.140 --> 59:46.980
It's such a shame.
I live with my mother.

59:47.040 --> 59:48.642
If you would have come home on time,

59:48.720 --> 59:50.447
you would have had the best dinner...

59:53.460 --> 59:55.788
All right, you cowboy freak!

59:55.860 --> 59:58.725
We're gonna make you walk this plank!

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.422
Yeah, you landlubber!

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.987
For stealing all our gold!

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:07.059
May the sharks eat you up
into little tiny pieces!

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.604
You haven't got any guts!

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.333
I got plenty of guts!

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.965
Get up there right now!

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.401
All right, now walk the plank!

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.810
Donald!

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.180
No!

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.692
Mom! Mom!

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.697
Mom! Donald!

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.905
Feel better?

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.974
Much.

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.772
You know, when I first met you,

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.939
I thought you were one
of those real tight-asses.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.950
You did? Well, you were wrong,
weren't you?

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.543
When I first met you,
I thought you were someone

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.264
whose apartment would look just like this.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.347
Well, you're quite right.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.984
One of these days, I'm going to shovel it out.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.257
However, Marisa,

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.198
lookit,
we're gonna go to dinner now, right?

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.359
Right.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.027
All the while,
I'm gonna be wondering

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.037
Whether or not you're
going to come back

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.538
and spend the night with me.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.305
That's not exactly an answer.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.973
See, if I have to eat food
and I'm worried about yes or no,

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.108
it sort of hyper-excites my metabolic rate.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.258
Can I take this as a definitive yes?

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.294
Yes.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.329
We're so down, so-

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.002
You guys know the neighborhood.

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:51.063
Every expedition needs its bearers,

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.334
its native guides.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.875
What's in it for us?

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:57.106
$10 a day, apiece.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.738
All right!

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.414
I get 20.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.548
The local chieftain.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.751
I was looking at a guest book,

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.005
checking the license plate numbers.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.541
This guy comes up behind me,
sticks this thing in the back of my neck,

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.261
says he's going to blow my brains out.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.462
Took my gun, gave it
to somebody else who was hiding.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:24.802
Made me lay on the desk face-down.

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.071
I heard yelling upstairs and shots.

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.374
The guy behind me ran.
I couldn't move.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.710
It was like my legs were gone.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.443
When I finally turned around,

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.041
Jerry was coming down the stairs.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.883
He was dying.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.650
They had a gun on you.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.386
He had a roll of pennies
he took out of the cash box.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:48.419
The only gun they had was mine,
the one they shot Jerry with.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.329
How could you know?

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.369
I froze.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.804
There's a heavy penalty in this life for fear.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.074
You can't blame yourself for surviving.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.049
What are you doing?

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.413
Lookit, I'm fighting male pattern baldness.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.081
I'm a little sensitive on the subject.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.887
I hope you don't mention it again.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.722
This is it.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.433
They call it Booger Alley.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.733
They said they heard heavy breathing.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.137
Where's it lead to?

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.107
Lets out by the railroad track.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.871
Get my rifle.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.210
We better go in and look around.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.016
Who is we?

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.285
The bearers follow the hunter into the lair.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.690
They back him up.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.251
Is that right?

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.058
Not in this jungle, mister.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.723
We'll see you on the other side.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.699
No backbone?

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.360
Must be the environment.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.494
Hey, man...

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.933
Oh, what the fuck.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.840
Y'all wait for me here, man.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:54.948
Jesus!

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.177
Got him?

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.059
Come on. Let's split.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.913
Studied history and psychology,

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.044
and when I got done,
I decided I was gonna be a cop.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.680
What I always wanted to be,
and I became a cop.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.848
Thank you.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.518
You know what Freud says about that...

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:38.855
What's he say?

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:43.331
He said the police want to punish society
for their own illicit desires.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.294
This guy never did the kamikaze shift
in East St. Louis.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.463
No. Probably not.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.335
Speaking of illicit desires...

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.339
Yeah?

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.534
Hi, Madison.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.941
Hey, Purdy, Ashe, how you doing?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.913
Thought you guys would be out
beating the bushes for Jungle Jim.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.347
They just scraped him up
over at Marquette Hills.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.317
What?
Brock?

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:05.286
Wasn't much of him left.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.719
We're pulling a double shift

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.690
looking for that damned animal.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.317
Tough break about the job, Madison.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.419
Yeah.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.123
Jesus.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.165
It was his own fault.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.532
I understand how you must feel.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.370
Don't understand me so quick.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.841
You mind?

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.571
No.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.926
Here.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.660
Your mom will be waiting.

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.602
Yeah.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.216
Rowans!

01:08:21.859 --> 01:08:23.331
Kelly!

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.475
No!

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.814
No!

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.647
Kelly!

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.959
Kelly.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:17.817
She'll be down in a minute.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.447
Marisa just hates to get
out of bed in the morning.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.388
Some days I used to go up there.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.925
She was sleeping so peaceful,

01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:25.858
I just didn't want to wake her up.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.227
She'd get so mad at me because
she didn't want to go to school.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.662
Then I'd make her some cookies,

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.325
and we'd watch Days of Our Lives

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:33.959
till Bill, my husband, came home,

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.435
and then we would...

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.962
I've been looking all over for that rosary!

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.531
There it is.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.305
God rest his soul.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.745
You know what he used to say to me?

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.408
Sleeping too much
leads to an early grave.

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:51.975
Worked just the opposite
for him, though.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.387
God rest his soul.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.449
Do you know I have an evil eye?

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.461
Bet you can't tell which one it is.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.362
Is it this one?

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.023
Or is it this one?

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.902
Did you like that?

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.337
What's your name?

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.807
Madeline.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.810
Can I give you a cup of coffee?

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:16.936
No, I got some.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.845
You really make yourself
at home, don't you?

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.007
Good morning, David.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.607
Baby.
Hi.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.118
Hi.

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.381
I came to apologize.

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.013
What for?

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.150
You name it, I apologize for it.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.719
Don't forget tonight's
a school night, Marisa.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.322
You want to see my rock collection?

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:45.797
Yeah, well, what do you need me for?

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.739
What does anybody need anybody for?

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.573
You're the country's leading herpetologist.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.545
You have a wonderful mind,
a doctorate degree,

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.639
and beautiful tits.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.911
I find this all fairly confusing.

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.395
There's nothing to be confused about.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.512
I know I'm a pain in the ass sometimes,

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.453
but anything worth having
is gonna be trouble...

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.083
That is, unless you want to go
live with the turtles.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.127
Are you going to come with me?

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.457
Well, we'll see.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.554
Well, we'll see.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:12.362
The sightings indicate
he's been moving east.

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.061
If he continues in that direction,

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:15.728
he's going to hit the canal.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.237
If we wait downstream,

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.933
he's going to come right to us.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.737
Then what happens?

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.039
Well, I could bring my mother.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.943
She could talk him to death.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.005
No, I don't want to talk to Madison!

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.550
Things are crazy enough as they are!

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.553
Look, just let me know
when the state troopers are ready!

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.022
Damn it!

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.924
He's not hiding in the bushes!

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.495
I see we've got a lock in the canal here

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.998
about a mile above the river.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.399
That's maybe 2 miles
from where we are right now.

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.960
Right. But if the lock's closed,

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.404
he's going to leave the river.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.873
What's he going to do when he gets out?

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:56.240
I guess that depends on what's in his way.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.812
Holy shit.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.751
That's him, off to port.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.970
Where'd he go?

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.839
There he is!

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.374
Get me the hell out of here!

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.940
Get me out!

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.637
Help me!

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.737
Pull me up!

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.483
How far down the canal?

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.153
...up to the river.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.197
Okay. Now, get me whatever's available,

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:59.132
and get it up to Shady Point,
by the Slade mansion!

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.429
We'll work it from there.

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.128
Nothing!

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.070
Listen, did you see which way he went?

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.005
He walked out down there about 200 yards.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.667
Which side?
This side.

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:09.676
Let's go.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:10.939
You've been here before?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.072
You bet.
Headed straight for Slade mansion.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.659
When I was a kid a long time ago,

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.931
I used to go in our back 40 there,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.405
and I'd cut down
one of those green hickories.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.601
Hickory?

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.404
Well, I would soak it in water

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.346
two, three weeks, four weeks at a time.

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:49.782
Now you go out,
and then you build yourself

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.945
a great big, deep pit of charcoal like that.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.112
Charcoal?

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.785
And then you picked up your hickories,

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.556
you know, put your hickory,
a little seal, right on top...

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.063
No too much of it,
or you'll drown out your fire.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.896
And then that aroma,
that aroma starts...

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.995
Beautiful.
The meat, it just permeated...

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.767
That's really living.

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.110
Oh, my God!

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.916
Mr. Slade...

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.307
Follow me!
Let's get the Volvo!

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.995
No! Open the door!

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.834
Let me in!

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.850
Open the door, for God's sake!

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.721
Mr. Slade!

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.964
Blaine, get the hell out of here!

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.399
Get going, you fool!

01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.814
Get the hell...

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.649
Get out of here!

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.147
You've got to let us in.

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.685
Could I see your invitations?

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.914
The alligator's coming.
You've got to let us in.

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:41.785
Alligator?

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:43.848
I got a magician
and a three-piece orchestra...

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.483
Open it.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.221
Hurry up.

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.092
I'll call the cops.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.688
Great. Call them.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.282
Where is it?

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.783
David!

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.343
Jesus Christ.

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.390
Where is it? Where is it?

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.562
Storm drain.

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.038
You're right.
He's headed back to the sewer.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.043
Then we know exactly where to find him.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.851
David! Hey, David!

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.444
I need your help!

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.113
David!

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.259
Let's say I give myself
two minutes on the timer.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.194
Let the chief know where I'm coming up.

01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:57.629
Make sure that manhole is clear.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.893
Got it.

01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:57.452
Come on!

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.196
I'm coming.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.389
Damn!

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.152
Shit.

01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.127
Hey, open up!

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.036
Hey! Hey!

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.744
Open up!

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.578
Move your car!

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.641
Lady, you've got to move your car!

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.639
The garbage truck...
Then back it up! Move it!

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.954
Hey!

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.550
Move that truck now!

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.924
Back it up...

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.206
Move your car.
There's somebody underneath.

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:23.162
What are you talking...

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:24.493
Hey, you asshole!

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.295
You're insane!
Get over!

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.949
You'll live. You'll live.

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.186
Any sign of him?

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:27.819
Only pieces.

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.761
Yeah, you believe me now.
No dream.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:33.198
When did I ever doubt you?

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:36.863
I think I'm gonna
lock you up with her mother.

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.303
How about that?

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.307
Her mother?

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.434
Think your mother would go
for something like that?

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.568
Yeah, she might.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.445
She goes for that
increasingly high forehead look.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.107
I think it runs in the family.

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.208
Yeah.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.349
We got him.

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.050
We sure did.
