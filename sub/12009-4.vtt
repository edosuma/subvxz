WEBVTT

00:03.235 --> 00:05.075
At least while we're eating.
Aghh...

00:05.115 --> 00:07.115
Arghh!

00:07.235 --> 00:09.715
Urhh! OK, right, I'm done now.

00:09.755 --> 00:12.155
It's all good.
Is it? Is it all good?

00:12.195 --> 00:15.395
You've contaminated another spoon.
Onto the fire? Mm-hm.

00:16.195 --> 00:18.515
You should get someone
to take a look at that.

00:18.555 --> 00:20.635
Cheers. Will you have a look at it?
No, not me.

00:20.675 --> 00:22.595
I don't know what I'm talking about,
do I?

00:22.635 --> 00:25.355
Of course you do. You've got
a penis, don't you? Of sorts.

00:25.395 --> 00:26.915
It's probably bedbugs.

00:26.955 --> 00:29.075
No way am I going eye to eye
with that thing.

00:29.115 --> 00:31.435
You don't mind, do you, Grum?
Knock yourself out.

00:31.475 --> 00:33.075
Can we please wait?
Oh, blimey!

00:33.115 --> 00:34.915
Really?
A bit, yeah.

00:34.955 --> 00:37.155
What does it look like?
Like a stick of rhubarb.

00:37.195 --> 00:40.355
Oh, that's fine.
Stabbed repeatedly with a fork.

00:40.395 --> 00:42.035
That's less promising.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.155
Also, there's, like, a kink in it.

00:44.195 --> 00:47.075
Oh, no. The kink's all mine.
Helps you get round corners.

00:47.115 --> 00:49.115
Reach parts others can't reach.

00:49.155 --> 00:51.875
Unfortunately, those are the parts
with herpes. Shut up!

00:51.915 --> 00:56.395
This isn't herpes. It's just
a few bedbugs having a nibble
on the old rhubarb. That's all.

00:56.435 --> 00:58.435
It's really fine.

00:58.755 --> 01:00.475
Aaaahhh!

01:00.515 --> 01:03.035
Grrrrr!
Stop it!

01:04.474 --> 01:06.475
We're running out of cutlery.

01:07.035 --> 01:08.835
Yes.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.955
Nice and warm in here, though, innit?

01:11.798 --> 01:28.870

01:29.435 --> 01:30.995
16...

01:31.035 --> 01:33.395
17, 18, 19...

01:33.435 --> 01:35.915
I can see 19 from here.
Thanks for the update.

01:35.955 --> 01:38.715
I'll let you know if owt changes.
How's that?

01:38.755 --> 01:41.795
A bit tight. It's for your own good.
You can't be trusted with hands.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.995
But people will think
I've been in an accident.

01:44.035 --> 01:46.795
You have. A horrific sex accident.
It's bedbugs.

01:46.835 --> 01:49.995
And 20.

01:50.035 --> 01:52.395
No, Grumio,
get that furry fuck out of here.

01:52.435 --> 01:54.315
Hello, pussy puss puss.

01:54.355 --> 01:56.315
Where are all these cats
coming from?

01:56.355 --> 02:00.115
According to t'landlord,
the Emperor's got them in
to get rid of all the mice.

02:00.155 --> 02:02.955
Good thinking. Not really.
We're now infested with cats.

02:02.995 --> 02:06.715
They'll have to get in some dogs.
Just work his way up the food chain?

02:06.755 --> 02:08.595
What eats dogs?
Greek people.

02:08.634 --> 02:10.315
That's very offensive, Grumio.

02:10.354 --> 02:12.355
That's a brilliant idea.

02:17.355 --> 02:20.515
You're copying a cat now, are you?
You're literally a copycat.

02:20.555 --> 02:23.675
Damn straight, this cat's a genius.
No, he's not. He's a prick.

02:23.715 --> 02:26.115
Cats think they're so cool.

02:26.155 --> 02:29.595
Get over yourself, mate.
You're a cat. You can't even read.

02:29.635 --> 02:31.635
Ahhh!

02:37.555 --> 02:40.355
Mess with me again, buddy,
you're going down.

02:40.395 --> 02:42.755
Do you hear me? All the way down.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.475
Morning.
Hello.

02:44.515 --> 02:47.715
Close the door before this dirt bag
and his dirty mates all flood in.

02:47.755 --> 02:49.755
Right. That's good advice.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.715
Cynthia, I've found Felix.

02:52.755 --> 02:55.955
Felix? Oh, Felix.

02:55.995 --> 02:57.675
Oh, thank God. Where was he?

02:57.715 --> 03:00.835
Next door. Marcus was just
dropping him off, weren't you?

03:00.875 --> 03:03.435
Yeah. Sorry,
I didn't realise Felix was your pet.

03:03.475 --> 03:06.515
I thought he was one of
the mangy strays from the courtyard.

03:06.555 --> 03:09.915
Well, he is from the courtyard.
And a lot of them are lovely too.

03:09.955 --> 03:12.315
Lovely, lovely cats.
He's clearly the nicest one.

03:12.355 --> 03:15.795
He was the only one we could catch.
Right, because he's the tamest?

03:15.835 --> 03:18.035
Because he was asleep.
Yeah, well, lucky him.

03:18.075 --> 03:20.395
He's landed on his feet.
Cats always do.

03:20.435 --> 03:22.995
Thanks for finding him.
My pleasure. My pleasure. Bye.

03:23.035 --> 03:25.035
Bye, Felix.

03:33.635 --> 03:36.795
Why does it have to be a cat?
I'm really not a cat person.

03:36.835 --> 03:40.395
I'm not really a dog person either.
What kind of person are you?

03:40.435 --> 03:42.475
I guess I'm a plant person.

03:42.515 --> 03:44.395
Anything quiet and still
I'm fine with.

03:44.435 --> 03:47.835
You'd better start
being a cat person,
because you cosy up to Felix,

03:47.875 --> 03:50.955
and Cynthia WILL cosy up to you
big time.

03:50.995 --> 03:54.795
Hi, guys. You will never guess
what I did last night.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.035
Stayed at home crying
and wanking again.

03:57.075 --> 04:00.515
No, that's not it. I met my long lost
Uncle Adrian for the first time.

04:00.555 --> 04:03.635
Lost. Why lost? Where was he?
Was he lost or just hiding from you?

04:03.675 --> 04:07.675
No. I didn't know he existed. Long
lost, as in absent family member.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.635
How long was he?
What was long about him?

04:09.675 --> 04:11.595
Was it his member?
No. What?

04:11.635 --> 04:13.315
Did he take out his long member?

04:13.355 --> 04:15.075
My uncle does not have
a long member.

04:15.115 --> 04:16.995
Oh, shame.

04:17.035 --> 04:18.875
Still, it's how he uses it.

04:18.915 --> 04:22.155
Fill me up, please, water boy.
Yes, water man.

04:23.475 --> 04:25.195
A bit behind today, are we,
Shredder?

04:25.235 --> 04:27.515
Yeah, sorry.
I shut my hands in a door.

04:27.555 --> 04:29.595
A door?

04:29.635 --> 04:34.035
Doors. I shut my hands in doors.

04:34.075 --> 04:36.195
A quick word in my office.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.955
OK. Yeah, sure. Office.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:48.395 --> 04:51.075
What's going on down there?

04:51.115 --> 04:55.115
Down where? It's obvious you're
sporting those makeshift mittens

04:55.155 --> 04:57.835
to stop you gouging
chunks out of yourself.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.595
How do you know these things?

04:59.635 --> 05:01.755
Been there, done that,
bound the hands.

05:01.795 --> 05:03.555
I'm pretty sure it's bedbugs.

05:03.595 --> 05:07.995
And where on your person
have these bedbugs bitten?

05:08.035 --> 05:11.395
Well, they've concentrated
their attacks on my...

05:12.355 --> 05:15.835
penis.
Why would they have done that?

05:15.875 --> 05:18.195
Well, largest surface area.

05:19.955 --> 05:22.035
I think it might be
the other type of bedbugs.

05:22.075 --> 05:26.275
The type you get not from the bed
itself, but from what you do in it.

05:26.315 --> 05:28.195
Right.

05:28.235 --> 05:31.315
Come on, Shredder, spill the beans.

05:31.355 --> 05:35.275
Well, I guess it has been hurting
when I spill the beans.

05:35.315 --> 05:37.355
Thank you.

05:37.395 --> 05:40.195
I'm gonna give you
the name of an excellent clinic

05:40.235 --> 05:44.635
and a cream that will help you.
Thank you.

05:46.155 --> 05:48.675
Herp Ease? That's a great name.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.315
It's a great cream.
The itch should soon disappear,

05:51.355 --> 05:53.755
though you might be left
with some discolouration

05:53.795 --> 05:55.835
which, in my opinion,
only adds character.

05:55.875 --> 05:57.755
Thank you. Thank you very much.

05:57.795 --> 06:00.595
Should I tell them that you sent me?
Absolutely not.

06:23.275 --> 06:26.475
Salve, Grumio.
All right, Landlord.

06:26.515 --> 06:28.635
Feeling lucky, are you?
I suppose I am, yeah.

06:28.675 --> 06:31.675
I just found a bit of chicken in
my teeth I didn't know were there.

06:31.715 --> 06:33.875
In that case,
you want to get one of these...

06:33.915 --> 06:36.395
Ride that luck
like a big old unicorn.

06:36.435 --> 06:38.235
What are they?
Lottery ticket.

06:38.275 --> 06:41.435
Caesar's raising funds
to ship in a load of dogs.

06:41.475 --> 06:43.555
We thought that might be next.
You want one?

06:43.595 --> 06:45.835
How much is it?
A single denarius.

06:45.875 --> 06:49.075
What's the prize? A million.
Imagine what you could do with that.

06:49.115 --> 06:51.315
Bloody hell,
I'd be a millionaire, wouldn't I?

06:51.355 --> 06:53.955
Yes, until you spent any of it
and then you wouldn't.

06:53.995 --> 06:55.795
So, I just wouldn't spend any of it.

06:55.835 --> 06:57.515
There's a plan.

06:57.555 --> 07:00.595
Right, the draw's tomorrow. Be lucky.

07:07.115 --> 07:09.715
Will you come in with me?
What for?

07:09.755 --> 07:11.555
In case the doctor
tries to finger me.

07:11.595 --> 07:13.275
Why would he do that?

07:13.315 --> 07:15.155
That's what they do,
these old quacks.

07:15.195 --> 07:17.155
They get you in there,
check you over...

07:17.195 --> 07:19.035
And they finger the shit
out of you.

07:19.075 --> 07:22.115
Even if you've just got a cold?
Even if you've just got a sniffle.

07:22.155 --> 07:24.355
Stylax Rufus...

07:24.395 --> 07:26.315
Yur...
Eurisces.

07:26.355 --> 07:28.995
Yes. That's me.

07:29.035 --> 07:31.475
So, shall I...?
I think I'll be all right.

07:31.515 --> 07:33.995
What if she tries to finger you?
I'll cope.

07:37.235 --> 07:42.395
And have you had intercourse
with anyone who's recently returned
from Gaul or Germania?

07:44.275 --> 07:45.955
So, yes, basically.

07:45.995 --> 07:47.275
Yes.

07:47.315 --> 07:49.515
Have you ever engaged in
sadism or masochism?

07:49.555 --> 07:51.555
No.

07:52.155 --> 07:55.395
It's much better, if you're honest.
Yes, then.

07:56.115 --> 07:58.075
OK.
I'm just gonna have a little look.

07:58.115 --> 08:00.715
Hey, aren't you going to buy me
dinner first?

08:00.755 --> 08:02.875
I tend to eat before my shift.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.915
That's very wise.

08:04.955 --> 08:07.075
Oh, it's a bad rash, isn't it?

08:07.115 --> 08:08.875
Yeah, it's quite...

08:08.915 --> 08:11.595
In fact, it's just a little bit
to the left on the...

08:11.635 --> 08:13.395
Yeah, that's it, yeah.

08:13.435 --> 08:15.715
OK, and how does it feel
when I do this?

08:15.755 --> 08:18.075
Yeah.

08:18.115 --> 08:20.395
That's fantastic.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.755
The awkward bit is out of the way.
We've already got to third base.

08:31.795 --> 08:34.395
Does that counts as third base?
Of course it does.

08:34.434 --> 08:37.554
In that case, she gets to third base
with several men every day.

08:37.595 --> 08:40.275
I think it was different.
She was laughing at me.

08:40.315 --> 08:43.115
Is that a good thing? At what
I was saying, not at my goolie.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.875
Sorry, your goolie?
Yeah.

08:45.915 --> 08:48.835
You can't have one goolie. It's just
your goolies. No, no, no, no.

08:48.875 --> 08:51.595
The whole thing is your goolies -
all three of them.

08:51.635 --> 08:55.155
But it you're talking about
one in particular, you say goolie.

08:55.755 --> 08:58.275
So when should I see her again?
Four or five years.

08:58.315 --> 09:01.635
That's too long. You can't just pop
in like it's your local cafe.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.275
Yeah, but I need to get back
in that little room with her.

09:04.315 --> 09:08.195
Shall I get Felix
the horrific dead pigeon
or the terrifying stuffed rat?

09:08.235 --> 09:11.195
Get both.
And pay ten denarii for carcasses?

09:11.235 --> 09:13.315
It's all about Cynthia, right?

09:13.355 --> 09:15.715
You get in with her pussy
and you'll get into her.

09:15.755 --> 09:19.035
OK, stop there. That's one of
the worst things you've ever said.

09:19.075 --> 09:21.075
I know. I've been working on it.

09:23.435 --> 09:25.435
These.

09:27.315 --> 09:29.395
It's a pigeon and a rat.

09:29.435 --> 09:32.275
Oh, they're... lovely.

09:32.315 --> 09:34.595
I should say... for Felix.

09:34.635 --> 09:37.675
Oh, right. Passing
a pet store, could not resist.

09:37.715 --> 09:40.275
They're a bit grisly.
Yes, but they have bells in,

09:40.315 --> 09:42.435
so they're also fun.

09:42.475 --> 09:44.315
Well, I'm sure Felix will love them.

09:44.355 --> 09:47.515
Yeah. I was thinking you and me
could take him for a walk.

09:47.555 --> 09:50.555
Cats don't go for walks.
We could carry him, then.

09:50.595 --> 09:52.595
And he's round at your place.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.635
Is he?
Yeah, he loves it there.

09:54.675 --> 09:56.355
And we love having him, obviously.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.715
Although you probably want him back
now, don't you?

09:58.755 --> 10:00.755
Oh, no rush. You guys bond.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.277
It's going brilliantly.

10:06.323 --> 10:09.003
Maybe I could put a cat flap in
between the two flats.

10:09.043 --> 10:12.623
That's a good idea. One man's cat
flap is another man's glory hole.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.575
Oh, what's he doing now?

10:14.615 --> 10:17.375
Erm... Oh,
I think he's coughing up a fur ball.

10:17.415 --> 10:19.135
Go on, buddy, you can do it.

10:19.175 --> 10:21.575
If I win the lottery,
I might buy a pet.

10:21.615 --> 10:24.055
Not like that, though. A big 'un.

10:24.095 --> 10:27.335
Like a bloody great horse.
What are you gonna do with a horse?

10:27.375 --> 10:29.815
Sit on it.
What? Like a big hairy chair?

10:29.855 --> 10:31.975
Yeah,
and you're not having a go on it.

10:32.015 --> 10:33.695
You bought the ticket
with my money.

10:33.735 --> 10:37.895
So? So I own it. I also own you
and all your possessions,
including your imaginary horse.

10:37.935 --> 10:40.735
Get your hands off my horse.
Doesn't matter anyway

10:40.775 --> 10:43.415
because there's as much chance
of you winning the lottery

10:43.455 --> 10:46.455
as there is of Felix getting on
two feet, admitting he's a prick

10:46.495 --> 10:48.895
and offering to put a good word in
with Cynthia for me.

10:48.935 --> 10:51.895
There's more chance of winning
the lottery. Only marginally.

10:51.935 --> 10:54.055
Because he's a cat.
Yeah, because he's a cat.

10:54.095 --> 10:56.095
But also because he's dead.

10:57.855 --> 11:00.495
Brrrrr!
Frog.

11:06.384 --> 11:07.944
He choked on something.

11:07.961 --> 11:11.041
What did he choke on?
The fur ball, I think.

11:11.081 --> 11:13.641
I mean, if it's any consolation,
I think he died happy.

11:13.681 --> 11:16.761
I don't think you can choke happily.
Well, serenely, then.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.681
Show me how he choked serenely.
Why?

11:19.721 --> 11:21.721
Because
I want to see it for myself.

11:22.401 --> 11:23.921
Er...

11:23.961 --> 11:25.961
He was a bit...

11:27.121 --> 11:30.361
That sort of thing.

11:30.401 --> 11:32.121
Did you like Felix?

11:32.161 --> 11:34.641
What? Yeah, of course I liked...
I liked him loads.

11:34.681 --> 11:37.041
So why did you threaten
to throw him off the balcony?

11:37.081 --> 11:39.081
That wasn't serious.

11:39.121 --> 11:41.881
'Mess with me again, buddy,
and you're going down.'

11:41.921 --> 11:43.961
Buddy? I called him buddy.
We were buddies.

11:44.001 --> 11:46.881
And did he mess with you again?
Is that what happened? No. No.

11:46.921 --> 11:48.961
Or did you give him herpes?
I'm sorry. What?

11:49.001 --> 11:52.281
We found this note in the bag
with the toys. Herp Ease.

11:52.321 --> 11:54.201
That's not mine. That's for Stylax.

11:54.241 --> 11:57.081
I told you it couldn't be his.
Erm... why couldn't it be mine?

11:57.121 --> 12:01.201
I could have herpes. I don't.
Just... I'm sexually active.

12:01.241 --> 12:04.001
With cats?
No, humans. Women. Human women.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.681
So did Stylax touch Felix?

12:05.721 --> 12:07.641
No.
Well, they shared a scratching post.

12:07.681 --> 12:10.361
Because all I know is that
Felix's last moments were spent

12:10.401 --> 12:12.881
with one man who threatened
to throw him off a balcony

12:12.921 --> 12:15.281
and another man riddled with herpes.

12:19.241 --> 12:20.921
You're burying the toys, are you?

12:20.961 --> 12:24.441
Yes, with their owner.
I kept the receipt, so we could...

12:24.481 --> 12:26.681
No, do bury them.

12:26.721 --> 12:28.721
It's what he would have wanted.

12:30.921 --> 12:33.841
She thinks I gave him herpes?
Or that I chucked it off a balcony.

12:33.881 --> 12:37.321
Mine's worse.
Yours involves chucking it,
mine involves fucking it.

12:37.361 --> 12:40.361
No, she's not accusing you of
actually fucking the cat to death.

12:40.401 --> 12:42.961
OK, good.
She just knows that you have herpes

12:43.001 --> 12:47.841
and you shared a scratching post.
So at the very worst, she thinks
you indirectly fucked it to death.

12:47.881 --> 12:49.801
Can you even give a cat herpes?

12:49.841 --> 12:52.121
I don't know.
Ask that nurse of yours.

12:52.161 --> 12:54.161
Don't talk about my nurse.

13:00.641 --> 13:03.201
What's wrong with you?
I don't want to talk about it.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.121
OK, cool.
Uncle Adrian died.

13:05.161 --> 13:07.801
What, the long one?
He just had a heart attack and died.

13:07.841 --> 13:10.441
God, that's terrible.
I know. I'm devastated.

13:10.481 --> 13:14.921
Although you did only just
find out he existed.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.361
So it's not that bad, is it?
Not that bad?

13:18.401 --> 13:22.201
No. I mean, the total number of
Uncle Adrians in your life

13:22.241 --> 13:25.081
is kind of the same as it was
a couple of days ago.

13:25.121 --> 13:27.521
There was a brief spike
and then it evened out.

13:27.561 --> 13:29.801
I've lost an uncle.
But he was already lost.

13:29.841 --> 13:33.081
So, you found him
and then you lost him again.

13:33.121 --> 13:35.161
Anyway, I've got something
to cheer you up.

13:35.201 --> 13:37.281
Go on.
Stylax has herpes.

13:37.321 --> 13:40.921
Ha! Yeah, that's pretty good.
Thanks for telling me.

13:40.961 --> 13:43.961
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I might not have it any more.

13:44.001 --> 13:47.281
For Jove's sake, I'm on
an emotional rollercoaster here.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.681
Hey, I just want to...

13:57.721 --> 13:59.761
Knock, please.
Yeah, sorry.

13:59.801 --> 14:01.401
Don't just barge in.
Sorry.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.601
I just wanted to say
you were spot on.

14:03.641 --> 14:06.561
It wasn't bedbugs.
It was genital herpes.

14:06.601 --> 14:09.441
The Herp Ease cream you recommended
worked a treat.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.481
You really know your stuff.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.921
I think you're in the wrong room.

14:19.961 --> 14:22.481
Is this not the office nurse?
Er, no.

14:22.521 --> 14:24.241
Do we have an office nurse?
No.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.401
Right.
You see, I've confused this room

14:27.441 --> 14:30.641
with where the nurse's room
might be if we had one.

14:31.721 --> 14:33.561
We've all done it.

14:33.601 --> 14:35.761
Can I get anybody some water
or a sandwich?

14:35.801 --> 14:37.801
Just go.
Cool.

14:52.681 --> 14:54.801
Hi. How is she?

14:54.841 --> 14:56.801
Bearing up.
Good. Good.

14:56.841 --> 14:58.521
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

14:58.561 --> 15:00.801
Not for killing Felix,
because I did not do that,

15:00.841 --> 15:03.441
but just for her tragic loss.

15:03.481 --> 15:06.881
Right. I'll pass that on.
And if there's anything I can do,

15:06.921 --> 15:08.601
please... let me know.

15:08.641 --> 15:12.001
Well, you can take out the rubbish.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.121
Yeah, more for her than... I could
take her for a drink or something.

15:15.161 --> 15:17.761
I don't think so.
Yeah, too soon.

15:17.801 --> 15:21.321
Yeah. And because you're
a snide, two-faced creepy liar.

15:21.361 --> 15:24.081
Right. Did she say that
or is that more your opinion?

15:24.121 --> 15:26.921
It's a combination.
Anything I can do to redeem myself?

15:26.961 --> 15:28.841
Taking this would be a...
Yes. Fine.

15:28.881 --> 15:30.961
Will you tell her I did this?
Probably not.

15:31.001 --> 15:33.001
Of course not.

15:35.161 --> 15:37.121
Nine women in one night?

15:37.161 --> 15:38.881
Yeah, approx.

15:38.921 --> 15:42.481
I mean, after I left here, I sort
of went on a bit of a sex rampage.

15:42.521 --> 15:45.121
A rampage, in a criminal sense?

15:45.161 --> 15:48.361
Oh, no, a consensual rampage.
You know, so it was all fine.

15:48.401 --> 15:50.201
Not from a sexual health
point of view.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.361
No sure. Sexual health-wise,
it's a fiasco.

15:54.281 --> 15:56.081
So you'll see me again, right?

15:56.441 --> 15:58.761
OK. Come through.

16:12.921 --> 16:15.201
Salve, Grumio.
All right, Landlord.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.481
Oh, you didn't win, then?
What makes you say that?

16:17.521 --> 16:19.881
Well, your clothes, your posture,
your face.

16:19.921 --> 16:22.201
It's not the look of
a classic lottery winner.

16:22.241 --> 16:23.961
I didn't know they'd done it yet.

16:24.001 --> 16:26.001
Yeah, the winning number is 3461.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.881
Check your ticket.
Yeah, I will do.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.641
How did you get on?
Me? I don't play the lottery, mate.

16:30.681 --> 16:32.521
I'm not an idiot.

16:32.561 --> 16:35.641
Let me know if you want one
for next week. Yeah, will do.

16:38.401 --> 16:41.481
One of them was a witch?
Yeah, she was horrible.

16:41.521 --> 16:43.641
So why did you have sex with her,
then?

16:43.681 --> 16:46.361
I know, right?
But anyway, enough about me.

16:46.921 --> 16:49.001
Let's talk about you, for a change.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.041
Are you single?
Yes, I am.

16:54.161 --> 16:57.721
You might feel some discomfort now as
I enter this swab into your goolie.

16:57.761 --> 17:00.121
I say goolie.
Sorry?

17:00.161 --> 17:02.161
I also say goolie.
Great.

17:02.561 --> 17:04.361
Do you want to go out with me
sometime?

17:04.401 --> 17:07.441
Because we both say goolie?
No, because we've got chemistry.

17:07.481 --> 17:09.560
Look, you seem like fun
and everything...

17:09.601 --> 17:11.401
Yeah? But you're also a...
Go on.

17:11.441 --> 17:13.521
Morally bankrupt sex addict.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.641
Ah. Mm. But I am fun.

17:15.681 --> 17:17.681
I'm sorry. It's a no.

17:19.001 --> 17:22.121
I made it all up,
all this sex rampage and that.

17:22.161 --> 17:24.800
I'm really not as naughty
as you think I am.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.481
I made it all up,
just so I could see you again.

17:27.521 --> 17:30.201
So, was that rash
you first came in with made up?

17:30.241 --> 17:31.641
Oh, no. That was real.

17:31.681 --> 17:34.361
And the hordes of one-night stands
you've had all...

17:34.401 --> 17:37.841
No, no, no. Don't count them.
Just give me a chance.

17:37.881 --> 17:42.921
There's honestly nothing you can say
right now to make me think
you're good boyfriend material.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.441
OK.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.401
Well, in that case,

17:47.441 --> 17:50.241
do you think it's possible
that I gave herpes

17:50.281 --> 17:52.561
to a cat?

18:04.721 --> 18:07.841
Then she said, 'I never ever
want to see you here again.'

18:07.881 --> 18:09.521
Harsh. Then what happened?

18:09.561 --> 18:12.201
Well, I put my penis away and left.
What else could I do?

18:13.561 --> 18:15.601
Grumio, mate,
can you clear all this up?

18:15.641 --> 18:17.441
Once I've found my lottery ticket.

18:17.481 --> 18:21.001
It was humiliating. I would have run
home if it wasn't for the chafing.

18:21.041 --> 18:22.881
I thought the herpes had gone.
So did I.

18:22.921 --> 18:24.761
But it's itching round the back now.

18:24.801 --> 18:27.121
Could it have migrated?
I don't know. Maybe.

18:27.161 --> 18:29.201
Would you take a look?
Not in a million years.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.921
G-man?
Not right now.

18:30.961 --> 18:33.041
Have you found it?
No, but I know where it is.

18:33.081 --> 18:35.241
Where is it?
Inside the cat.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.721
Serious?
It weren't coughing on a fur ball.

18:37.761 --> 18:40.161
It were my ticket.
What makes you think that?

18:40.201 --> 18:42.681
1) It were a very greedy cat.
2) It ain't in here.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.441
You can't fault his logic.

18:44.481 --> 18:46.921
How dark is it outside?
It's dark enough, I reckon.

18:46.961 --> 18:50.041
No, wait. What if Cynthia sees us?
I want my horse.

18:50.081 --> 18:54.081
Grumio, mate, tell me this.
What are the chances of the ticket
being inside the cat?

18:54.121 --> 18:56.161
50-50.
Hm.

18:56.201 --> 18:59.521
And if it is, what are the chances
that this is the winning ticket?

18:59.561 --> 19:01.961
50-50.
Well, it clearly isn't.

19:02.001 --> 19:05.681
Course it is. In what way is
you winning the lottery 50-50?

19:05.721 --> 19:07.721
Either I will win it or I won't.

19:11.601 --> 19:13.521
Are you sure it was here?
I think so.

19:13.561 --> 19:17.281
I'd have paid more attention if I'd
known we'd be digging him up again.

19:17.321 --> 19:19.521
Are we really using a spoon?
It's fine.

19:19.561 --> 19:21.561
It's one of my scratching spoons.

19:22.321 --> 19:24.721
What the hell was that?

19:24.761 --> 19:26.081
Oh, that'll be the toys.

19:26.121 --> 19:28.121
I'm taking them back.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.601
I've got him.
Hooray. Nice one.

19:32.481 --> 19:35.161
Salve, boys.
All right, Landlord.

19:35.201 --> 19:38.321
Having fun? My lottery ticket's
in Cynthia's cat.

19:38.361 --> 19:40.361
I want half.
Half the cat?

19:40.401 --> 19:42.481
Half the winnings.
You can have a quarter.

19:42.521 --> 19:45.081
Half, or I tell the girls.
All right, done.

19:45.121 --> 19:47.481
How are we gonna cut it open?
With the spoon.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.761
Scoop him out like a melon?
I'll do the honours.

19:49.801 --> 19:53.001
Why have you got that?
For this sort of thing. Shove over.

19:53.721 --> 19:56.841
It could have got lodged in the
throat. I'll try the stomach first.

20:03.961 --> 20:06.081
Oh, it won't be in either, actually.
Why not?

20:06.121 --> 20:08.121
Cos I've just found it in my pocket.

20:08.161 --> 20:10.081
Should've probably checked there
first.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.041
Probably, yeah.
Did we win?

20:12.081 --> 20:14.081
What's the winning number?
3461.

20:14.121 --> 20:16.121
What does that say?

20:16.161 --> 20:18.401
Two... No, then.
No, we didn't.

20:18.441 --> 20:20.121
Well, get him back in there.

20:20.161 --> 20:22.841
That'll be five denarii
reburial charge. Of course.

20:22.881 --> 20:25.681
And make sure you scrub your hands.
Don't want to catch worms.

20:25.721 --> 20:27.401
Mangy mog.

20:29.121 --> 20:32.041
Oh, that'll explain the itchy anus.

20:40.601 --> 20:43.281
I'm afraid
that's extremely infected. Mm-hm.

20:43.321 --> 20:48.041
But I can give you some cream for
the itch and recommend some food to
flush the worm out of your bowels.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.201
Cool.

20:49.241 --> 20:52.001
So what time do you get off work?
