01:02.101 --> 01:04.436
It's important you understand.

01:05.187 --> 01:07.564
It's not you, it's me.

01:08.816 --> 01:11.902
What we have is so special.

01:14.113 --> 01:16.740
I love you more than I can say,

01:17.324 --> 01:20.060
but I'm sorry, truly,

01:20.160 --> 01:22.913
because... I fucked up.

01:24.581 --> 01:25.608
Look...

01:25.708 --> 01:30.045
I owe you an explanation, but honestly,
I don't know where to begin.

01:34.383 --> 01:36.176
Well...

01:36.301 --> 01:39.430
maybe there, at the beginning.

01:39.722 --> 01:43.726
<i>You see, I grew up above a great party.</i>

02:00.117 --> 02:02.353
- Gordon!
- Mommy?

02:02.453 --> 02:05.147
- She's in the kitchen.
- What are you doing?

02:05.247 --> 02:08.459
I'm waiting for your mother to bring out
the hors d'oeuvres. Now bugger off.

02:10.836 --> 02:14.173
<i>After school, I used to love
to listen to my father lecture.</i>

02:14.298 --> 02:18.135
Now the faculty would have me
teach you it was Wordsworth,

02:18.260 --> 02:19.828
Keats, and Coleridge,

02:19.928 --> 02:24.850
who in writing about love,
defined the Romantic age.

02:25.809 --> 02:29.438
And they've told me to ignore Byron.

02:30.022 --> 02:33.484
Mad, bad, and dangerous to know was
how one of his many lovers described him.

02:33.609 --> 02:36.236
He was controversial.

02:36.653 --> 02:40.140
Now did you know,
this esteemed establishment told Byron

02:40.240 --> 02:42.851
that he wasn't allowed to bring
his beloved dogs to college?

02:42.951 --> 02:46.663
So he said screw the rules. He went out
and he bought himself a bear.

02:47.539 --> 02:52.211
Brought it to class on a chained leash.
He tied up to that very pipe just there.

02:52.920 --> 02:57.866
So you see, it was Byron who defined
the Romantic age, which wasn't about love.

02:57.966 --> 03:01.161
It was about going your own way,

03:01.261 --> 03:03.705
defying authority
and following your heart,

03:03.805 --> 03:06.308
sticking it to the man,
and as many women as possible.

03:06.433 --> 03:09.520
Now that... that is Romantic.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.147
And if the faculty
don't like me saying so,

03:12.272 --> 03:15.050
well, they can take this job
and they can shove it.

03:15.150 --> 03:19.321
Because like Mr. Bob Dylan, I ain't gonna
work on Maggie's farm no more.

03:20.531 --> 03:24.893
<i>Dad hated authority,
and everyone loved him for it.</i>

03:24.993 --> 03:29.498
<i>All I wanted was to be just like him.</i>

03:33.669 --> 03:35.921
Forget the critics.

03:36.046 --> 03:38.407
Let them have their opinions.

03:38.507 --> 03:42.552
Let them publish their books and brag
about them at tedious faculty parties,

03:42.678 --> 03:47.599
and let university librarians
file those books away.

03:47.933 --> 03:50.769
The faculty has called this class

03:50.894 --> 03:55.440
"The Romantics and Literary Theory."

03:56.441 --> 04:00.262
I want you all to forget
the second half of this sentence.

04:00.362 --> 04:04.283
There's nothing theoretical
about the romantics.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.730
"Where true love burns,

04:09.830 --> 04:14.668
"desire is love's pure passion.

04:15.419 --> 04:18.296
"It is the reflex

04:18.422 --> 04:21.048
"of our earthly frame...

04:21.882 --> 04:24.886
"that takes its meaning
from the nobler part

04:25.012 --> 04:27.681
and but translates...

04:28.098 --> 04:30.892
the language of the heart."

04:33.937 --> 04:36.815
Wakey, wakey, Professor Haig.

04:38.191 --> 04:41.720
Oh, shit. It's Saturday, isn't it?

04:41.820 --> 04:44.640
No, don't look like that.
Are you sure about this?

04:44.740 --> 04:46.767
I mean, I make a terrible
first impression.

04:46.867 --> 04:50.646
Will you relax, Richard?
My dad is gonna love you.

04:50.746 --> 04:53.607
- Really?
- Yeah, you'll have lots to talk about.

04:53.707 --> 04:57.878
Yeah? Corporate hard-nosed raider
meets libidinous lit professor.

04:58.003 --> 05:00.238
- It's a match made in heaven.
- I just want my dad

05:00.338 --> 05:03.367
to meet the wonderful man
I've been dating for the last six months.

05:03.467 --> 05:05.886
- Six months?
- Broke your record, didn't I?

05:06.386 --> 05:09.498
- Crazy.
- "Love is begun by time,

05:09.598 --> 05:14.019
and time qualifies the spark
and fire of it all."

05:14.644 --> 05:17.939
Relax, you're still very sparky, darling.
Really sparky, I mean...

05:18.064 --> 05:22.319
Well, my liege, I must hie me
to Heathrow, thou to London,

05:22.444 --> 05:25.806
- chimes of 6:00 sharp.
- Sure, of course.

05:25.906 --> 05:28.825
- Sharp.
- Sharp. 6:00. Chimes.

05:55.477 --> 05:57.103
Sal.

05:57.229 --> 06:00.398
Sal, I've got to go. Why?

06:00.524 --> 06:05.070
Because we've been talking for so long
I've lost track of time, space, and myself.

06:06.696 --> 06:09.783
<i>Hello? Hello? Olivia?</i>

06:10.075 --> 06:12.352
- Not to worry, madame.
- I'll call maintenance.

06:12.452 --> 06:15.038
- We'll fish it out later.
- <i>Are you there? Can you hear me?</i>

06:15.163 --> 06:17.874
- Please don't.
- <i>Hello?</i>

06:18.500 --> 06:20.293
<i>Olivia?</i>

06:39.646 --> 06:41.298
<i>AÃºpa!</i>

06:41.398 --> 06:45.318
There you go. They fishing
your phone out of the drain?

06:47.946 --> 06:49.264
No.

06:49.364 --> 06:54.202
I told them not to.
I am cutting myself off from the world.

06:54.494 --> 06:57.330
Footloose, fancy-free.

06:59.082 --> 07:03.111
Won't that be lonely?
An island unto yourself?

07:03.211 --> 07:05.238
- No.
- Madame?

07:05.338 --> 07:08.033
- Can I have a glass of red wine, please?
- Yes, madame.

07:08.133 --> 07:13.847
No. I would populate the island
with all new people.

07:14.889 --> 07:17.334
People that I actually like.

07:17.434 --> 07:19.477
Yes, but then things change.

07:19.602 --> 07:21.671
The people you thought you'd like...

07:21.771 --> 07:24.274
turn out to be as bad
as the people you left behind.

07:24.566 --> 07:28.486
Soon you're moving to another island,
and so it goes on, ad infinitum.

07:29.195 --> 07:33.116
You know my solution?
Get along with everyone.

07:33.783 --> 07:35.660
Really?

07:36.077 --> 07:40.832
Then why are you here alone
in a hotel bar on a Saturday night?

07:41.041 --> 07:43.877
Well, I certainly
wouldn't keep you waiting.

07:44.961 --> 07:49.157
Exactly. Because you never know
what kind of...

07:49.257 --> 07:52.635
handsome stranger
I might start talking to.

07:56.973 --> 08:00.627
"I do desire we become
better strangers."

08:00.727 --> 08:03.213
Pulling out the Shakespeare.

08:03.313 --> 08:05.382
Is that line successful
for you normally?

08:05.482 --> 08:08.259
I had my moments with it, you know?

08:08.359 --> 08:09.944
<i>Comme ci, comme ca.</i>

08:10.070 --> 08:12.906
Excuse me, sir. Ma'am.

08:15.617 --> 08:19.287
Thank you. You're so kind.

08:19.788 --> 08:22.123
There you go. Back on the grid.

08:22.749 --> 08:24.901
Why is that the most helpful people

08:25.001 --> 08:27.904
are always around
when you do not want any help?

08:28.004 --> 08:31.508
Give him a minute.
He'll be back with a shoemaker.

08:33.426 --> 08:37.679
On the other hand, it's nice to be
looked after every now and then.

08:37.806 --> 08:40.917
The other day I found myself
opening a door for a man.

08:41.017 --> 08:43.227
What happened to chivalry?

08:43.977 --> 08:47.257
- You know why guys open doors for women?
- No.

08:47.357 --> 08:49.592
So we can check out your asses
as you walk by.

08:49.692 --> 08:52.804
Well, you're just full of all these
amazing insights, aren't you?

08:52.904 --> 08:56.991
I can tell within one minute
of meeting someone...

08:58.576 --> 09:00.286
if I want to be with them.

09:01.329 --> 09:03.414
How about me?

09:03.540 --> 09:05.250
Do you want to be with me?

09:06.876 --> 09:08.545
Yes.

09:09.712 --> 09:11.965
For one more minute.

09:13.550 --> 09:15.218
Okay.

09:16.845 --> 09:19.347
You've got a minute.

09:20.056 --> 09:22.600
What are you going to do with it?

09:26.813 --> 09:30.049
Olivia? Oh, my God! Hi!

09:30.149 --> 09:32.402
What are you doing here?

09:34.028 --> 09:37.474
I was in Dublin in the book festival,

09:37.574 --> 09:39.809
and Dad called me and told me
that you were coming,

09:39.909 --> 09:43.746
that he was meeting you here, and that
I should come and surprise you. Surprise!

09:43.871 --> 09:46.608
- He flaked on us, didn't he?
- Yes.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.210
So how did you two make
the connection? Hi!

09:51.254 --> 09:53.214
You're the famous Olivia?

09:54.632 --> 09:59.721
My beautiful sister Olivia.
Olivia, my gorgeous Englishman...

09:59.846 --> 10:03.182
- ...Richard Haig. Thank you.
- You look great.

10:05.602 --> 10:08.963
So me, my dad, and my mom are staying
at this hotel that we always stay at,

10:09.063 --> 10:13.676
and my dad keeps running off saying he has
meetings, or appointments, or whatever.

10:13.776 --> 10:17.447
And finally my mom gets fed up,
and she decides to tail him one day

10:17.739 --> 10:20.033
to one of his "meetings".

10:20.283 --> 10:22.994
Ends up following him
to the other end of the beach

10:23.119 --> 10:26.873
where Livvy is staying with her mom.

10:27.415 --> 10:30.276
And all hell breaks loose.

10:30.376 --> 10:32.737
Our dad is leading a double life,

10:32.837 --> 10:37.008
- like raising two families at the same time.
- What a naughty boy.

10:37.133 --> 10:39.802
Right? Crazy.

10:42.930 --> 10:44.682
Anyway...

10:45.183 --> 10:49.879
I take Kate to the beach, I'm sitting there
and I'm trying to process everything.

10:49.979 --> 10:53.633
What my father did, my poor mom,

10:53.733 --> 10:56.302
and the fact that I have
this little lovely sister.

10:56.402 --> 10:59.055
For me, I mean, I was stoked.
I always wanted a big sister.

10:59.155 --> 11:04.911
And I decide the only way we can protect
each other from this craziness

11:05.203 --> 11:09.732
is if Kate and I make
a pact, no secrets.

11:09.832 --> 11:11.985
Absolute honesty.

11:12.085 --> 11:15.863
From this day forward,
we would tell each other everything.

11:15.963 --> 11:18.324
No matter what, always.

11:18.424 --> 11:22.303
And we have.
And we're, like, best friends.

11:22.428 --> 11:24.180
So, Livvy...

11:25.223 --> 11:26.849
how is your Alan?

11:29.060 --> 11:30.770
What?

11:31.479 --> 11:33.147
Please. Tell us about Alan.

11:35.066 --> 11:37.110
He's great.

11:37.527 --> 11:41.889
Livvy's Alan is the Alan Sloan.
You know, the romance writer?

11:41.989 --> 11:44.517
And Livvy edits his books,
and they're totally in love.

11:44.617 --> 11:47.603
Madly and totally in love
with a romance writer.

11:47.703 --> 11:50.414
- That sounds fascinating.
- Well,

11:50.540 --> 11:55.027
no more than the Romantics professor's
passion for his students, surely.

11:55.127 --> 11:57.296
- Livvy, be nice.
- Yes, Kate.

11:57.421 --> 11:59.449
Would either of you like
a little taste of my steak?

11:59.549 --> 12:02.218
- No thanks.
- It's very tender.

12:05.972 --> 12:08.975
- You're unbelievable, aren't you?
- I'm sorry?

12:09.100 --> 12:12.378
Of course. On the verge
of graduating, going home.

12:12.478 --> 12:14.255
She's the perfect catch
for you, isn't she?

12:14.355 --> 12:16.632
- Hey.
- I get it. I get it.

12:16.732 --> 12:20.303
He's hot, and funny, and smart,

12:20.403 --> 12:23.072
and he's got the suave accent.

12:23.197 --> 12:27.685
But all I see is a lothario
with an eternally wandering eye

12:27.785 --> 12:30.354
who simply charmed
the pants off you, literally.

12:30.454 --> 12:35.568
- Livvy, what are you doing?
- Kate, I know this feels like love,

12:35.668 --> 12:39.489
but no, no, no, no.
This is not love. This is a fling.

12:39.589 --> 12:41.949
How do you know?
What are you even saying?

12:42.049 --> 12:46.454
Obviously, you're looking
for a father figure, but in our case

12:46.554 --> 12:52.310
it means a self-centered, cheating
womanizer who's not to be trusted.

12:52.435 --> 12:54.837
And you're just so young,
you can't see it.

12:54.937 --> 12:56.964
How young were you
when you ran off with Anwar.

12:57.064 --> 12:59.567
- We thought I was pregnant!
- Well, I am.

13:00.484 --> 13:02.470
- What?
- What?

13:02.570 --> 13:06.741
- I wanted to tell you earlier, but...
- Pregnant? With a baby?

13:08.034 --> 13:09.452
Yeah.

13:09.577 --> 13:13.064
I wanted to tell you another way,
but this is like so weird, I just...

13:13.164 --> 13:16.792
No, this is the perfect way.
This is really the perfect way, I think.

13:18.252 --> 13:21.739
You know what? This is great.
Really great.

13:21.839 --> 13:26.177
- Well, that was so heartfelt.
- Livvy. Livvy.

13:26.302 --> 13:28.512
Thank you so much for supper.

13:28.638 --> 13:31.415
Remind me never to do this again.

13:31.515 --> 13:33.934
I'm just going to go outside
and get some fresh air.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.503
- What do you mean?
- Excuse me. Air.

13:35.603 --> 13:37.396
- Yeah, run.
- What?

13:37.813 --> 13:39.465
- Richard?
- Yeah?

13:39.565 --> 13:41.233
- Richard? Look.
- Yeah, I'm here.

13:41.359 --> 13:45.930
I know I just dropped a bomb on you
back there, so right here, right now,

13:46.030 --> 13:48.616
- I'm giving you the out.
- I just want some air, that's all.

13:48.741 --> 13:53.162
You just need some time to think.
It's fine. I get it.

13:54.580 --> 13:58.109
So I'm moving to LA.

13:58.209 --> 14:00.961
I got a really cool job
at a venture capital firm.

14:01.379 --> 14:04.031
- You're full of surprises today.
- You'll love LA.

14:04.131 --> 14:07.702
It'll be like Cambridge-ish,
but with a lot of palm trees,

14:07.802 --> 14:11.347
and, like, chicks with tans and stuff.

14:13.849 --> 14:16.977
- Oh, honey, you're all clammy.
- I just need some air. That's all, really.

14:17.103 --> 14:18.671
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

14:18.771 --> 14:21.690
I'll be back in there. Go ahead. You go.

14:22.316 --> 14:24.110
- Richard.
- Yeah?

14:24.485 --> 14:29.156
- You're going to be a great father.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

14:38.124 --> 14:40.668
Did you have a good dinner then, sir?

14:58.060 --> 15:01.647
All right, where the buggering hell
have you been? I said 6:00.

15:01.772 --> 15:06.652
Sorry about that, Dad. Didn't realize
your grumbling ran on such a tight schedule.

15:07.528 --> 15:10.447
Bloody miserable out there, as usual.

15:15.744 --> 15:17.146
Don't touch that.

15:17.246 --> 15:19.540
Good God, Dad. I'm not five years old.

15:19.665 --> 15:22.626
- Hi, Richard, dear.
- Hello, Joan.

15:22.751 --> 15:27.548
- How is everything?
- Oh, just terrific. Thanks for asking.

15:27.673 --> 15:30.968
You still boffing
that Yank totty, are you?

15:31.343 --> 15:33.929
Yes, she's a great girl.

15:34.054 --> 15:37.124
Bright, beautiful, ambitious.

15:37.224 --> 15:41.604
You mean a horrible little upstart
determined to go places.

15:41.729 --> 15:45.508
So, tell me, when are you going
to start going places?

15:45.608 --> 15:47.318
- Good God. Please.
- Oh, come on. Jesus.

15:47.443 --> 15:49.303
Come on, when I was your age,

15:49.403 --> 15:52.389
I mean, I'd been the head
of the department for seven years.

15:52.489 --> 15:55.643
Yeah, and it made you
so happy, didn't it, Dad?

15:55.743 --> 15:57.703
All right, what's the grievance today?

15:57.828 --> 16:01.707
Split infinitives, too many used?
Too many women with jobs?

16:01.832 --> 16:05.711
It's his waterworks. He's got
to go back into hospital next week.

16:05.836 --> 16:08.797
Stop talking about my cock, woman.

16:14.219 --> 16:16.680
Tell me something, Dad.

16:20.768 --> 16:22.836
Why did you and Mom get married?

16:22.936 --> 16:26.465
What kind of an inane question is that
for a Thursday evening?

16:26.565 --> 16:29.151
For a man who revels
in reckless promiscuity,

16:29.318 --> 16:31.945
your four marriages
do beg some questions.

16:33.781 --> 16:36.934
Your mother fed me regularly.

16:37.034 --> 16:40.396
She pleasured me
half decently now and then.

16:40.496 --> 16:44.875
- What more could a man want?
- Oh, I don't know, friendship?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.921
Someone to see the world with,
have a laugh with?

16:49.171 --> 16:51.507
Maybe even start a family with.

16:52.549 --> 16:55.411
Good God, man.

16:55.511 --> 16:58.972
You've fallen for that little slice
of American pie.

16:59.098 --> 17:00.791
- Dad...
- Now you listen to me.

17:00.891 --> 17:05.561
This might be the most important
bit of advice that I ever give you.

17:06.480 --> 17:11.510
American women may be fun and Victoria's
Secret when you first bed them,

17:11.609 --> 17:15.263
but as soon as they get their claws
into you, they stop fucking

17:15.364 --> 17:20.602
and start eating, and the only ass
you're going to get is a fat one.

17:20.702 --> 17:21.854
Why did open my mouth?

17:21.954 --> 17:27.667
American women invariably become
spouters of self-help platitudes,

17:27.792 --> 17:32.673
they're addicted to designer labels,
dieting, and frozen yogurt.

17:32.798 --> 17:37.244
Overall, thoroughly nasty,
selfish, vain creatures

17:37.344 --> 17:40.722
that don't fuck!

17:41.807 --> 17:45.060
Thank you for your fatherly advice.

17:45.352 --> 17:47.396
Good night, Joan.

17:49.231 --> 17:53.318
Bugger off then! See if I care.

18:00.367 --> 18:02.870
Kate! Kate!

18:02.995 --> 18:05.998
Screw Cambridge. I'm in.

18:06.123 --> 18:07.691
- Really?
- Really.

18:07.791 --> 18:10.335
- Really?
- Yes, come on!

18:12.838 --> 18:16.383
<i>Up and away we set off</i>

18:16.842 --> 18:20.429
<i>Secretly scared we'd get lost</i>

18:21.013 --> 18:25.042
<i>Up in the clouds over the town</i>

18:25.142 --> 18:27.853
<i>Beyond the wall</i>

18:29.146 --> 18:33.133
<i>Some of us knew we might fall</i>

18:33.233 --> 18:37.029
<i>Under the weight of it all</i>

18:37.237 --> 18:41.283
<i>And though we'd been warned
of the oncoming storms</i>

18:41.408 --> 18:44.620
<i>Still we stood tall</i>

18:45.621 --> 18:49.416
<i>So from the moonlight</i>

18:49.625 --> 18:53.754
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

18:53.921 --> 18:57.591
<i>This will be our time</i>

18:57.841 --> 19:01.970
<i>Free-falling nosedive</i>

19:08.977 --> 19:11.313
Look into the world, Jakey.

19:12.022 --> 19:14.650
It's a beautiful world.

19:16.401 --> 19:19.196
Do you need the booby now?
Do you want the booby?

19:19.321 --> 19:23.200
Yes. There's a boy after my own heart.

19:26.536 --> 19:30.274
<i>The whole world in our sights</i>

19:30.374 --> 19:34.461
<i>Like a miniature paradise...</i>

19:39.883 --> 19:43.537
Okay, family, here we go.

19:43.637 --> 19:48.000
Here you are, Jakey. Welcome home.
A modest little house...

19:48.100 --> 19:50.477
which your granddad bought
your mom out of guilt.

19:50.602 --> 19:52.754
- Don't fall in the pool.
- I won't.

19:52.854 --> 19:55.023
You probably will never meet anyway.

19:55.148 --> 19:57.234
He has a very bad habit
of never showing up.

19:57.359 --> 19:58.568
Hey.

20:00.112 --> 20:01.863
All right.

20:07.035 --> 20:09.730
Oh, I'm going to call Livvy.
Can you take the baby?

20:09.830 --> 20:11.790
- Sure.
- Okay.

20:11.915 --> 20:13.417
Okay.

20:45.532 --> 20:48.785
I know it's easier to read the critics
and the CliffNotes,

20:49.870 --> 20:51.913
but forget about them.

20:52.038 --> 20:56.084
Read the poems. Put the time in.

20:56.501 --> 21:02.132
After all, "Nothing will come
of nothing."

21:03.550 --> 21:05.594
What was that from?

21:10.182 --> 21:11.725
Anyone?

21:12.726 --> 21:15.545
- Hey. There you go.
- I'm having trouble getting on the Wi-Fi.

21:15.645 --> 21:16.938
What's the password again?

21:18.565 --> 21:20.984
I think they're all on Prozac.

21:21.109 --> 21:23.653
Did you hear from the university yet?

21:24.863 --> 21:28.450
- No. They went with the other guy.
- I told you to kiss ass more.

21:28.575 --> 21:31.995
- Angela, please.
- I'm sure something will open up soon at ULA.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.356
Yeah, well, one can
only hope, can't one?

21:34.456 --> 21:37.692
In the meantime, I'm glad that
you're still slumming it here with us.

21:37.792 --> 21:40.320
You city college lot
don't pull any punches do you?

21:40.420 --> 21:43.089
- We will go 16 rounds with anyone.
- Bring it on.

21:58.063 --> 21:59.856
Asshole.

22:00.774 --> 22:02.233
Asshole.

22:02.359 --> 22:05.320
Never let me hear you
say that word, Jake.

22:05.820 --> 22:09.766
The word is "ahh's-hole" not "aah's-hole."
Can you say "ahh's-hole?"

22:09.866 --> 22:13.244
- Asshole.
- Yes, elongate the A.

22:14.037 --> 22:15.330
There we go.

22:15.789 --> 22:18.166
I'll get them. I'll get them.

22:20.502 --> 22:23.672
- Mama!
- No, mama is at work.

22:25.090 --> 22:27.926
- She'll be back later.
- Mama.

22:32.555 --> 22:36.017
No, that's Hummer. Hummer.

22:36.434 --> 22:38.186
Well done. Hummer.

22:38.311 --> 22:39.629
- Pull over.
- What?

22:39.729 --> 22:42.983
- Pull over! Listen to this voicemail.
- I can't pull over.

22:45.527 --> 22:46.928
<i>I thought he was saying "mama,"</i>

22:47.028 --> 22:50.990
<i>and then I realized he was pointing
at one of those absurdly oversized tanks</i>

22:51.116 --> 22:55.245
<i>driven no doubt by some idiot
with an absurdly undersized penis.</i>

22:55.370 --> 22:57.622
- This is not an oversized car.
- <i>All right.</i>

22:58.123 --> 22:59.666
He knows.

23:07.132 --> 23:10.243
- Hey there, sexy. Where are you?
- I'm in New York.

23:10.343 --> 23:12.245
Honey, do I look chunky?

23:12.345 --> 23:14.472
Didn't mean to call you sexy.
Wrong person.

23:15.890 --> 23:18.435
No, I look good.

23:19.018 --> 23:20.562
<i>Very funny. Is Kate there?</i>

23:20.687 --> 23:23.715
She's not back yet, still banking.
Busy counting things.

23:23.815 --> 23:26.443
Well, tell her to call me
right, right away,

23:26.568 --> 23:28.862
because I have something
really big to tell her.

23:28.987 --> 23:32.223
No secrets in the family. Pray tell.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.351
<i>I can't believe
that I'm about to tell you...</i>

23:34.451 --> 23:38.647
Richard, I don't know
why this is so hard for me.

23:38.747 --> 23:41.733
I've been trying
to tell you now for weeks.

23:41.833 --> 23:45.587
- Alan's asked me to marry him.
- I'm in love with somebody else.

23:46.629 --> 23:48.281
You're what?

23:48.381 --> 23:52.035
We're getting married! Don't act
so surprised that somebody asked me.

23:52.135 --> 23:54.220
- Are you on the phone?
- Who is it?

23:54.345 --> 23:56.973
- Who are you talking to?
- Answer the question. Who is it?

23:57.098 --> 24:00.226
- I just did!
- Who's on the phone?

24:01.186 --> 24:02.587
- Hello?
- Kate! Kate!

24:02.687 --> 24:06.316
- I have to call you back.
- What? Hello?

24:07.025 --> 24:11.971
I was just, I mean... I was
really young, okay? Really young.

24:12.071 --> 24:15.767
Not that you're not, of course.
But I really thought that I loved you,

24:15.867 --> 24:18.311
but clearly I was working
through daddy issues.

24:18.411 --> 24:23.900
And then I got pregnant, and you
were just trying to do the right thing.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.780
And you've been a really good father, but
let's face it, you never really loved me.

24:28.880 --> 24:32.408
- But Brian does.
- Brian? Brian?

24:32.508 --> 24:34.494
That little idiot from the office?

24:34.594 --> 24:39.207
He likes to talk to me about start-ups
and acquisitions and exit strategies.

24:39.307 --> 24:41.876
I mean, all the stuff that you think
is so boring about me.

24:41.976 --> 24:43.837
It is boring. God.

24:43.937 --> 24:48.149
Why do you have to be so
goddamn English? Talk to me!

24:48.441 --> 24:53.221
You can leave me,
but I am not leaving that boy.

24:53.321 --> 24:55.031
Brian.

24:55.698 --> 24:57.450
Richard,

24:57.575 --> 24:59.953
why can't you just talk to me?

25:11.005 --> 25:13.783
Now, I know two years in the pool house

25:13.883 --> 25:16.744
makes me look a little a nut,
but I'll say two things.

25:16.844 --> 25:19.914
First, your mom and Brian
hated me being there,

25:20.014 --> 25:22.475
which was the most wonderful
incentive to stay.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.227
And secondly...

25:25.895 --> 25:28.314
I wanted to be close to you.

25:28.982 --> 25:31.109
Good morning.

25:32.443 --> 25:35.405
I think you're going
to want to see this.

25:35.571 --> 25:39.200
- Oh, let me see it.
- Is the big bad professor awake yet?

25:39.325 --> 25:43.354
<i>Jake to Dad. Breaker, breaker.
You got your ears on?</i>

25:43.454 --> 25:44.998
- Okay.
- <i>Are you awake?</i>

25:45.123 --> 25:49.627
- It's Jakey. Just a second.
- <i>Get up! Are you having a sleepover?</i>

25:50.628 --> 25:53.448
Hi, Jakey! Good morning.

25:53.548 --> 25:56.075
- Where are you?
- <i>Can I come and play?</i>

25:56.175 --> 25:57.844
Just a second, Jakey.

25:57.969 --> 26:00.246
- Hey.
- Hi!

26:00.346 --> 26:03.558
Would you mind just skedaddling for now?
It's my son.

26:03.683 --> 26:06.894
Your son? I love kids! I babysit!

26:07.020 --> 26:09.339
- Sorry about this. The perils of parenthood.
- It's okay.

26:09.439 --> 26:11.149
- Come and see me during the week.
- When?

26:11.274 --> 26:14.068
- Make it a surprise.
- Oh, I love surprises! Okay, I will.

26:14.193 --> 26:16.429
Okay, good-bye.

26:16.529 --> 26:18.973
- Who was that?
- Oh, just a friend of mine.

26:19.073 --> 26:22.076
Very busy lady. She had to leave.
There you go.

26:23.202 --> 26:24.954
Aren't these uncomfortable?

26:25.079 --> 26:28.416
That's why girls love it when you
take them off. Let's get some pancakes.

26:28.541 --> 26:30.168
Dad, get on with it.

26:30.752 --> 26:33.463
So there we were.

26:34.714 --> 26:36.466
And then...

26:36.758 --> 26:38.409
last week...

26:38.509 --> 26:40.953
everything went pear-shaped.

26:41.053 --> 26:43.431
I have the papers you asked for.

26:44.849 --> 26:48.978
- Will that be all, professor?
- For now, yes, thanks.

26:51.898 --> 26:53.608
Great.

26:54.358 --> 26:56.110
Excuse me.

26:57.278 --> 26:59.347
Newest member of the TA
of the month club?

26:59.447 --> 27:01.641
How dare you insinuate such a thing?

27:01.741 --> 27:05.244
- You have a visitor. Be nice.
- Send them in.

27:06.204 --> 27:07.622
Thank you.

27:11.417 --> 27:14.821
- Professor Pickard, what a delight!
- How's your father these days?

27:14.921 --> 27:18.424
- Loving life. He is happy as a clam.
- That's good to hear.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.844
Well, I received your application
for the position at the University.

27:21.969 --> 27:25.765
I was in the area, so I thought I would
just pop by and invite you to a soirÃ©e

27:25.890 --> 27:27.708
- I'm giving tomorrow.
- Splendid.

27:27.808 --> 27:29.685
The faculty will be there, of course.

27:29.810 --> 27:33.397
I thought it might be a good idea if you do
come by and just sort of butter them up.

27:33.523 --> 27:36.692
Not me, by the way.
I consider myself lavishly buttered.

27:36.817 --> 27:38.428
Oh, well, that's good to know.

27:38.528 --> 27:41.405
- So we'll see you there.
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.

27:42.907 --> 27:45.226
"Dustin Kalarney"
just sold its 5 millionth copy.

27:45.326 --> 27:47.662
- You're unbelievable.
- What?

27:47.787 --> 27:52.525
Here I am, splayed out like an open-faced
sandwich so we can have a baby,

27:52.625 --> 27:55.544
- and all you care about...
- Mr. Sloan.

27:56.003 --> 27:58.364
Would you mind signing a copy
of your book for me?

27:58.464 --> 28:02.451
- Of course. Did you like it?
- Are you kidding? It was great.

28:02.551 --> 28:05.763
Really? Is that Desiree two Es or one E?

28:07.390 --> 28:09.308
What the hell was that for?

28:09.433 --> 28:12.520
Oops, it slipped.
Can I have my phone back, please?

28:14.105 --> 28:16.465
There you go, you can do it.
Just concentrate.

28:16.565 --> 28:20.611
- Nice big swing. That's it.
- Dad, I suck.

28:20.736 --> 28:23.723
No, you don't, you don't.
You look great, just eye on the ball.

28:23.823 --> 28:27.560
Who's here! Jakey, what up, dawg?
Yo, give me some love.

28:27.660 --> 28:29.228
Blow it up. Blow it up.

28:29.328 --> 28:31.439
- Jellyfish sting!
- Jellyfish sting!

28:31.539 --> 28:33.958
Lots of love. We were just
playing a little ball here.

28:34.083 --> 28:36.377
- Right. Sorry, sorry.
- That's all right. Okay.

28:37.295 --> 28:40.031
What are you doing? You're a righty.
You got to switch your hands around.

28:40.131 --> 28:43.759
- Come around there. Bat up!
- Eye on the ball. Hit it to Dad!

28:44.510 --> 28:47.705
Sorry, Dad! Are you okay? Are you okay?

28:47.805 --> 28:51.642
I'm okay, son. I'm all right.
Just... occupational hazard.

28:51.767 --> 28:55.271
- That looks pretty bad.
- No, this. It's okay.

28:55.396 --> 28:57.231
Jakey!

28:57.481 --> 28:58.774
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:58.899 --> 29:02.553
- Did you remember Atlanta?
- Yeah. No? Atlanta?

29:02.653 --> 29:05.322
- Brian and I, four days, conference.
- Got it.

29:05.448 --> 29:08.325
- We leave the day after tomorrow.
- Good. Sounds good. I'll be there.

29:08.451 --> 29:10.036
- No, you'll be here.
- I'll be here.

29:10.161 --> 29:12.063
- Yeah. Here's Jakey's schedule.
- Great.

29:12.163 --> 29:14.482
I left a copy in your room
and another one on the fridge.

29:14.582 --> 29:17.026
- All right. That's good.
- So, yeah.

29:17.126 --> 29:19.086
I'm on it. Jawohl!

29:20.296 --> 29:22.048
Okay.

29:23.174 --> 29:25.326
No, I understand,

29:25.426 --> 29:29.889
but I strongly believe that three slaves
is enough. It's enough. Come on.

29:39.190 --> 29:41.066
You!

29:45.988 --> 29:47.823
Dr. Collins!

29:51.952 --> 29:53.245
Son of a bitch!

29:57.917 --> 29:59.835
Yeah!

30:00.753 --> 30:02.546
Jesus.

30:04.089 --> 30:05.841
Come in.

30:06.258 --> 30:09.053
- Shouldn't you be at work?
- Yeah, covering the Asian markets.

30:09.637 --> 30:12.456
Oh, hey, by the way, I can get you
in on a pretty sweet no-load.

30:12.556 --> 30:15.835
These guys are killing it right now. I can
get you 15%, 18%. Just say the word.

30:15.935 --> 30:18.187
The word is no.
What is it you want? I'm busy.

30:18.312 --> 30:20.815
This letter came for you. It's about
your green card. I'm sorry.

30:20.940 --> 30:23.467
- I opened it before I saw who...
- Just read it, Brian, thank you.

30:23.567 --> 30:26.554
- I mean, you've opened it. Just read it.
- All right. "This is your final warning.

30:26.654 --> 30:29.306
If you and your spouse fail to attend
your interview next week,

30:29.406 --> 30:32.368
deportation proceedings
will be initiated."

30:35.538 --> 30:39.041
Blimey, mate. Looks like you could be
in a spot of bother with the Bobbies.

30:40.543 --> 30:43.737
Keep working on the accent, Brian.
Close the door on the way out.

30:43.837 --> 30:46.173
- Cheerio.
- Shut up.

30:46.298 --> 30:49.885
I love the dentist.
I'm not drooling, am I?

30:50.719 --> 30:52.763
Hello, Mr. Haig.

30:52.888 --> 30:55.516
You can't drink alcohol
when taking this medication.

30:55.641 --> 30:56.642
- Really?
- Yes.

30:56.767 --> 30:57.710
- No?
- No.

30:57.810 --> 31:00.212
Absolutely not. Wouldn't dream of it.
Thank you so much.

31:00.312 --> 31:01.714
- No alcohol.
- Good.

31:01.814 --> 31:03.632
- We'll see you soon.
- Can't wait.

31:03.732 --> 31:05.901
Look forward to it. Thank you so much.

31:06.026 --> 31:07.636
- No alcohol.
- No alcohol.

31:07.736 --> 31:09.655
- I mean it.
- I mean it, too.

31:16.370 --> 31:19.315
Okay, let's go this way.
Any time you feel like it,

31:19.415 --> 31:22.918
- jump in and lavish me with praise.
- Copy that.

31:23.043 --> 31:25.921
- So glad you could make it!
- Oh, thank you!

31:26.046 --> 31:27.506
- Here you are.
- Thanks. Wonderful.

31:27.715 --> 31:32.369
Please, help yourself to refreshments.
My wife made her famous cheese balls.

31:32.469 --> 31:35.247
Please be sure to try one
and compliment her accordingly.

31:35.347 --> 31:37.224
Will do.

31:38.851 --> 31:42.855
There are some very, very important
people here. I'd like you to meet them.

31:42.980 --> 31:46.050
And they are your kind
of people, Richard.

31:46.150 --> 31:48.152
Come this way.

31:51.030 --> 31:54.642
My dear colleagues,
this is Richard Haig.

31:54.742 --> 31:57.186
This is Professor Vale, Bates, Berg,

31:57.286 --> 31:58.996
- Ang and Professor Jones.
- Hello.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.461
Can we do that again?
I forgot your names already.

32:06.712 --> 32:10.240
It is a damn shame we didn't hire you,
what was it, three years ago?

32:10.340 --> 32:14.178
Three years, two months, 17 days.
But who's counting?

32:14.636 --> 32:16.538
- You know, I met your father once.
- Oh, yeah?

32:16.638 --> 32:20.334
He delivered a fascinating lecture,
a retort to Terry Hearst,

32:20.434 --> 32:23.729
a hermeneutical reading
of Milton's "Paradise Lost."

32:23.854 --> 32:26.565
- Wish I'd been there for that one.
- Where are you from in England?

32:26.690 --> 32:29.568
- And are you a Rich or a Dick?
- I'm a Richard.

32:29.693 --> 32:32.654
- Your father took a structural stance...
- You know, the missus and I,

32:32.780 --> 32:35.032
we love it over there,
we go every summer.

32:35.157 --> 32:38.327
- You do? Great.
- Cheers again, matey.

32:38.452 --> 32:41.563
Richard, I want to let you know
that these fervent minds here

32:41.663 --> 32:44.583
have taken great care looking over
your application material.

32:44.708 --> 32:47.586
Never trust an Englishman
who doesn't drink, Richie boy.

32:47.711 --> 32:49.989
- Syllabus...
- ...epistemological level.

32:50.089 --> 32:51.256
Academics. Yup, yup, yup.

32:51.381 --> 32:55.244
- I do have one small question for you.
- This one's the biggest yapper of them all.

32:55.344 --> 32:59.181
How are the Romantics relevant
to today's students?

33:03.352 --> 33:04.962
You want me to answer this question now?

33:05.062 --> 33:09.258
I'm sure we'd all enjoy hearing
just a taste of one of your lectures.

33:09.358 --> 33:11.777
- A taste.
- A mere amuse-bouche is all.

33:12.277 --> 33:15.614
Why not the whole meal? Why don't you
come down and see me in action?

33:15.739 --> 33:18.267
- I happen to be free on Thursday.
- Christ, what about that?

33:18.367 --> 33:20.869
I see you've already met my wife.

33:24.456 --> 33:28.527
I'm just going to go outside for a moment
here, and just jump in front of a bus.

33:28.627 --> 33:30.779
Where are you going?
You didn't even say goodbye!

33:30.879 --> 33:32.798
That's true.

33:33.757 --> 33:35.551
Bye!

33:35.926 --> 33:38.053
I wonder if he was flirting with me.

33:38.679 --> 33:40.597
Oh, my God.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.937
Oh, shit.

33:49.565 --> 33:51.567
Oh, bollocks.

34:12.295 --> 34:13.405
Shit.

34:13.505 --> 34:17.050
Good evening, Officer. Oh, boy.
Have I been drinking?

34:18.427 --> 34:21.013
I drink every night. How about you?

34:21.722 --> 34:24.308
Can't we all just get along?

34:36.695 --> 34:38.405
Thanks.

34:41.699 --> 34:44.143
Thanks again for bailing me out.

34:44.244 --> 34:47.539
- And for the silent treatment.
- Don't talk to me.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.547
I still can't believe it.

34:56.672 --> 34:59.259
- Can't believe what?
- I wasn't talking to you.

34:59.384 --> 35:03.830
And I wasn't talking to you,
my darling little fornicating ex-wife.

35:03.930 --> 35:05.999
- Shut up, Richard.
- Alan dumped me.

35:06.099 --> 35:10.020
What a small world.
My wife did exactly the same thing.

35:10.145 --> 35:12.314
She used to adore me.

35:12.939 --> 35:15.150
Where, oh, where did the love go?

35:15.275 --> 35:17.444
She turned 30 and wised up.

35:17.736 --> 35:21.056
So, what's going on?
Why are you here, Olivia?

35:21.156 --> 35:23.684
- Thank you so much for helping out.
- It's the least I can do.

35:23.784 --> 35:26.186
- Helping out? Helping out with what?
- I needed to know

35:26.286 --> 35:30.023
that Jake was going to be looked after,
fed, and driven by a responsible person

35:30.123 --> 35:32.876
- with a valid driver's license.
- Fine. Why her?

35:33.001 --> 35:36.171
Livvy offered to come
at a very difficult time for her

35:36.296 --> 35:39.324
to bail us out of the mess
that you put us in.

35:39.424 --> 35:41.009
You know what?

35:41.134 --> 35:45.706
- I've had enough of this.
- You know, you say "I" a lot.

35:45.806 --> 35:50.627
Really? Well, I know that Jake
loves having you around.

35:50.727 --> 35:53.880
But I'm getting phone calls
from your immigration attorney

35:53.980 --> 35:56.466
because you don't ever bother
to call him back.

35:56.566 --> 36:00.762
I can't be in your life anymore.
I'm enabling your degenerate behavior.

36:00.862 --> 36:03.907
And what is the point
of all this right now?

36:04.032 --> 36:07.619
Richard, if you want me to pretend
like we're happily married

36:07.744 --> 36:11.706
so you can stay in this country,
you better get it together.

36:25.554 --> 36:27.706
- Yeah?
- <i>Gotcha.</i>

36:27.806 --> 36:30.625
- <i>I woke you up, didn't I?</i>
- Dad, is that you?

36:30.725 --> 36:34.880
You know, there are no time zones
in China. Did you know that?

36:34.980 --> 36:37.774
<i>The whole bloody country
is on Peking time,</i>

36:37.899 --> 36:40.569
<i>and that's the way it should be.</i>

36:40.694 --> 36:44.306
- We should all be on Peking time.
- <i>Don't be a dumb prat.</i>

36:44.406 --> 36:47.726
The whole world
should be on London time.

36:47.826 --> 36:50.370
Okay. What do you want, Dad?

36:52.914 --> 36:55.400
- How's the little turd?
- Don't call him that.

36:55.500 --> 36:59.070
Come on,
you're far too bloody sensitive.

36:59.170 --> 37:02.115
<i>All right, great to hear from you, Dad.</i>

37:02.215 --> 37:05.302
Why don't you go badger Joan? Okay?

37:05.427 --> 37:06.995
<i>She's not here.</i>

37:07.095 --> 37:11.141
Shit. Okay. I've got to go. Goodbye.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.285
Richard Haig?

37:31.328 --> 37:32.412
Thank you.

37:40.795 --> 37:43.131
So, your interview is Monday.

37:43.256 --> 37:46.301
This is the fourth quarter now, two minute
warning, you got no timeouts left.

37:46.426 --> 37:47.869
What the hell are you talking about?

37:47.969 --> 37:52.932
If your ex-wife won't show up to your
interview, it's going to be Hail Mary time.

37:53.058 --> 37:54.726
Okay?

37:55.977 --> 37:59.397
- So, did you get a full-time job?
- Doing my best.

37:59.522 --> 38:01.967
Have you recently joined
any terrorist organizations?

38:02.067 --> 38:05.487
Applied all over. Fingers crossed.

38:08.365 --> 38:10.617
Have you ever been arrested?

38:13.286 --> 38:16.289
- DUI.
- When? How many years ago?

38:16.414 --> 38:19.859
Friday? I mean, they can't kick me
out of the country for that, can they?

38:19.959 --> 38:22.921
- Jakey's a US citizen.
- You see the people in my waiting room?

38:23.046 --> 38:25.824
The kid born here, the parents, illegal.

38:25.924 --> 38:28.551
They're deporting the parents!

38:28.843 --> 38:31.930
Oh, yeah, it's game seven,
win or go home time.

38:32.555 --> 38:36.226
All right, well, if you join
a recovery program now...

38:36.559 --> 38:37.877
What, recovery?

38:37.977 --> 38:41.256
You do the 10 mandated sessions
the court's going to give you for the DUI.

38:41.356 --> 38:44.092
- 10? That's going to take me weeks!
- Hell week, baby. Two-a-days.

38:44.192 --> 38:46.678
You get your ex-wife to your interview
and you get a great job.

38:46.778 --> 38:49.989
You do all that, and you get
the ring, baby, okay?

38:50.573 --> 38:52.951
Yes, of course.

39:12.512 --> 39:14.973
<i>Hijos de puta.</i>

39:39.873 --> 39:41.916
Everything all right?

39:44.878 --> 39:46.963
Yeah. Why?

39:47.088 --> 39:49.282
Want to borrow my car?

39:49.382 --> 39:52.135
Okay, if you're not using it.

40:06.149 --> 40:09.068
That's good, that's good,
that's good. It's okay!

40:16.242 --> 40:18.561
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

40:18.661 --> 40:21.164
Did Kate tell you about
the one-way system at pick up?

40:22.999 --> 40:25.585
No, I didn't think so. It's okay.

40:26.294 --> 40:30.214
- All right, toots. Step on it.
- Oh, boy.

40:31.257 --> 40:35.912
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
Car, car! Jesus.

40:36.012 --> 40:38.581
Where the hell did you learn
how to drive?

40:38.681 --> 40:40.391
Mexico.

40:40.975 --> 40:44.479
Oh, can you please get that?
Where is my phone? Where's my phone?

40:44.604 --> 40:47.815
- I'm waiting for a very important call.
- Here you go. Sorry, it's down here.

40:49.651 --> 40:50.652
Hello?

40:50.777 --> 40:54.097
<i>Olivia? I have Tim Prince
from Creative Management Lit for you.</i>

40:54.197 --> 40:56.824
- Okay.
- Can't he dial the phone by himself?

40:56.949 --> 40:58.810
- <i>Hey, babes!</i>
- Hi!

40:58.910 --> 41:03.665
- <i>Listen, so sorry about Alan. Awful!</i>
- Thanks, Tim. Thank you.

41:03.790 --> 41:06.568
<i>I caught my ex-wife in downward dog
with my tantra teacher</i>

41:06.668 --> 41:09.337
<i>coming out of her central eye.
You feel so...</i>

41:09.462 --> 41:11.864
- Angry.
- Who the hell is this guy?

41:11.964 --> 41:13.366
<i>Okay, listen, babes,</i>

41:13.466 --> 41:16.803
<i>if anyone can go from editor to author,
it's you, and I mean that.</i>

41:16.928 --> 41:19.831
<i>And I got your sample chapter.
Give me a day or two to look it over.</i>

41:19.931 --> 41:22.166
- Of course.
- <i>I'll be gentle. I promise.</i>

41:22.266 --> 41:25.478
- Who says I like it gentle?
- <i>That's my girl. Okay, got to jump.</i>

41:25.603 --> 41:28.106
- <i>Bye, babes.</i>
- Bye!

41:29.649 --> 41:33.486
- Fascinating exchange.
- How can men move on so quickly?

41:33.611 --> 41:36.014
- What?
- It's like a switch for you, isn't it?

41:36.114 --> 41:38.099
You flip it off,
then you turn to the next one.

41:38.199 --> 41:41.394
You flip that one on, and when you
get tired of that, you just flip another.

41:41.494 --> 41:45.331
Like a pilot on a cockpit.
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

41:45.456 --> 41:47.817
What the hell are you talking about?

41:47.917 --> 41:50.361
Wishful thinking, Richard.
I wish I was like...

41:50.461 --> 41:53.781
Eyes on the road, eyes on the road!
Do not enter! Wrong way! Wrong way!

41:53.881 --> 41:56.843
- Oh, relax. Relax.
- I am, I am very relaxed.

41:56.968 --> 41:59.303
You're like an old lady!

42:00.012 --> 42:04.042
You men, you'd rather just go out there

42:04.142 --> 42:07.837
and have sex than work things out.

42:07.937 --> 42:09.647
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

42:09.772 --> 42:14.694
But your horniness is nothing
but a big mask for you to hide behind.

42:14.819 --> 42:18.156
- Now, what's wrong with a big mask?
- Let me ask you something.

42:18.281 --> 42:22.518
How can you teach the Romantics
when you can't even have a real feeling?

42:22.618 --> 42:24.395
Is irritation a real feeling?

42:24.495 --> 42:28.316
I mean, listening to you flirt on the phone
with some guy who's calling you babes,

42:28.416 --> 42:31.002
- oohing and ahhing. No...
- Please. I wasn't oohing and ahhing.

42:31.127 --> 42:35.590
I like it gentle. Good Lord, anyone
would think you were having an orgasm.

42:35.715 --> 42:38.076
I do not sound like that when I...

42:38.176 --> 42:43.097
Anyway, you should hear some of the stupid
noises you guys make when you're...

42:43.598 --> 42:47.643
You can't even say the word, can you?
Come on. What do we sound like?

42:48.144 --> 42:50.563
For example, you have the bear.

42:57.028 --> 42:58.054
I can see your tonsils.

42:58.154 --> 43:00.306
- Then you have the sports commentators.
- Oh, yeah?

43:00.406 --> 43:05.494
<i>Baja la pelota, recibe con el pecho,
mete mano en el Ã¡rea chica. Gol!</i>

43:06.621 --> 43:10.750
- What kind of men have you been with?
- And then there's the quiet ones.

43:15.171 --> 43:16.464
- Are you finished?
- No.

43:16.589 --> 43:19.951
- Of course not.
- And the worst one is the Tourette's one.

43:20.051 --> 43:22.595
- What?
- You know, "Shit, fuck.

43:22.720 --> 43:26.515
I love you, fuck me, oh,
motherfucker bitch, I love you.

43:26.641 --> 43:29.418
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me."

43:29.518 --> 43:31.646
Hey, that sounds like you, Dad.

43:33.439 --> 43:35.566
I heard him once on the walkie-talkie.

43:35.691 --> 43:38.177
Mr. Haig, do you have a minute?

43:38.277 --> 43:42.390
Of course I do.
Come on, toots. This way.

43:42.490 --> 43:46.310
This morning, Jake said
he had a question about the rules.

43:46.410 --> 43:50.481
He asked if he was allowed to use
the special alphabet.

43:50.581 --> 43:52.900
- Oh, boy.
- I didn't know what that was.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.338
So he asked if he was allowed
to say the "A" word.

43:57.630 --> 44:00.992
Then he asked,
"Can I say bugger, crap, dummy?"

44:01.092 --> 44:03.953
And when he got to F, he said,
"Am I allowed to say 'frick,'

44:04.053 --> 44:06.430
because I know I'm not allowed
to say 'fuck.'"

44:07.431 --> 44:10.434
It was at that point that I sent him
to the principal's office.

44:15.272 --> 44:19.151
- And what did you say for G?
- Goddamn.

44:19.276 --> 44:20.736
Mr. Haig,

44:20.861 --> 44:26.033
how is Jake adjusting to your new...
living situation?

44:27.410 --> 44:31.355
No, no, this is not what it looks like,
or what it sounds like. No, no, no.

44:31.455 --> 44:34.984
- We don't need to have an explanation.
- I think there's been a misunderstanding.

44:35.084 --> 44:37.837
- I would never...
- You've said enough.

44:44.135 --> 44:46.287
Oh, wonderful.

44:46.387 --> 44:49.098
I'll walk to the curb. Mind your hands.

44:49.223 --> 44:52.335
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

44:52.435 --> 44:55.938
I'm just going to get
some delicious Potatoes Latinos.

44:57.022 --> 45:00.025
Yeah, and maybe a manicure.

45:00.317 --> 45:02.345
Or a bikini wax.

45:02.445 --> 45:05.156
Bye. I'll see you later. You take care.

45:05.281 --> 45:08.075
- Whatever.
- Bye.

45:11.662 --> 45:15.775
We have two new members today.
We have Cindy and Richard.

45:15.875 --> 45:17.376
So, Cindy, do you want to...

45:20.212 --> 45:22.423
Hi, I'm Cindy.

45:22.715 --> 45:25.426
And I'm an alcoholic.

45:28.095 --> 45:31.056
Thank you, Cindy. Richard?

45:31.307 --> 45:36.562
Hi, I am Richard,
and I'm not an alcoholic.

45:36.687 --> 45:41.342
I'm English, a country with...
a few thousand years of history,

45:41.442 --> 45:44.386
and part of that history
is the communal practice

45:44.486 --> 45:46.555
of having a drink in the pub.

45:46.655 --> 45:50.976
Now, I know it's not your fault
a few sad, sorry pilgrims arrived here

45:51.076 --> 45:55.898
and infected your country with the message
of puritanical masochism.

45:55.998 --> 46:00.711
But it is your fault you've all taken it
on board quite so earnestly.

46:00.836 --> 46:04.798
So... you chaps go ahead.

46:05.132 --> 46:07.118
Knock yourselves out.

46:07.218 --> 46:10.596
But just know this. The first thing
I intend to do when this hour is up:

46:10.971 --> 46:13.933
is hit that bar across the street
and have a nice cold one.

46:14.767 --> 46:17.645
- Good luck with that.
- Thank you, Chad.

46:25.819 --> 46:28.447
How are the Romantics relevant to you?

46:29.031 --> 46:32.101
You know, the only reason I'm taking
this class is so I can get my GPA up

46:32.201 --> 46:35.788
so I can play baseball
at Arizona State, so...

46:37.498 --> 46:39.275
How about you, Stacy?

46:39.375 --> 46:41.710
How are the Romantics relevant to you?

46:42.294 --> 46:43.712
They're not.

46:49.259 --> 46:51.303
You have been such a wonderful audience.

46:51.428 --> 46:53.122
I can't wait to see you all next week,

46:53.222 --> 46:57.126
when I shall be lecturing naked,
wearing a sombrero.

46:57.226 --> 46:59.603
It'll be so wonderful.

47:02.481 --> 47:04.274
Fuck me.

47:06.402 --> 47:08.028
Olivia?

47:08.153 --> 47:11.390
- Hey, babes! There you are!
- Oh, Tim! Hi!

47:11.490 --> 47:13.575
How are you, beautiful?

47:15.869 --> 47:17.579
Okay.

47:18.288 --> 47:20.416
About this.

47:20.999 --> 47:22.584
This rocks.

47:22.710 --> 47:25.045
- Really?
- It is smart, it is funny.

47:25.254 --> 47:27.156
- Oh, I love Jenna.
- Jane.

47:27.256 --> 47:30.868
You might want to change that. Sex sells.
Jane makes me think of nun in a wimple.

47:30.968 --> 47:32.386
God, but you are so talented.

47:32.553 --> 47:35.347
You're so beautiful, too.
And trust me, that helps, babe.

47:35.472 --> 47:38.334
I'm gonna take you to the stars.
I am gonna take you to the stars.

47:38.434 --> 47:41.603
All I ask is that these shoulders
be the ones you stand upon.

47:41.729 --> 47:43.105
Watch the silk, though?

47:48.277 --> 47:49.011
Hello?

47:49.111 --> 47:51.805
Richard, listen. They've assigned
your case for investigation.

47:51.905 --> 47:53.641
Really? What does that mean?

47:53.741 --> 47:56.018
You're under surveillance
by an undercover federal agent.

47:56.118 --> 47:57.770
- <i>Jesus! Fuck!</i>
- Yes.

47:57.870 --> 47:59.288
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

48:00.748 --> 48:03.859
Shit. He's here tonight.
He just flashed his badge.

48:03.959 --> 48:05.486
Don't fumble the ball, now!

48:05.586 --> 48:08.756
<i>All that matters is that you exhibit
good moral character, okay?</i>

48:08.881 --> 48:11.175
Okay, everybody, grab a seat.

48:11.300 --> 48:15.137
Okay, so, Chad, I believe
you wanted to start us off?

48:15.554 --> 48:18.415
I'm Chad, and I am 13 days sober.

48:18.515 --> 48:21.894
- Yeah! Way to go, Chad!
- All right, Chad!

48:22.436 --> 48:26.882
All right, so why don't you tell us
how that feels?

48:26.982 --> 48:29.843
Well, you know,
it started by not going...

48:29.943 --> 48:33.780
Wendy? Excuse me, Wendy,
just a moment there, please.

48:33.906 --> 48:35.699
Sorry, everyone. Can I say something?

48:35.824 --> 48:38.702
Sorry, Chad, I didn't mean to interrupt
your moment of glory there.

48:39.620 --> 48:41.205
My name is Richard,

48:41.330 --> 48:46.251
and I'd like to amend my earlier comments
about the drinking habits of the English.

48:46.752 --> 48:50.572
I mean, just because the entire country
hits the pub after work doesn't mean

48:50.672 --> 48:53.909
we can't all be alcoholics,
because we are.

48:54.009 --> 48:57.763
We are inebriates, national disgrace.

48:57.888 --> 49:01.416
What else? I'm married, very happily so.

49:01.516 --> 49:04.294
Oh, and I have a son.
A beautiful little son called Jakey.

49:04.394 --> 49:09.566
Born here, in this country, a country which
I love and has such meaning to my heart.

49:09.691 --> 49:11.318
So, Richard...

49:11.735 --> 49:14.179
with all of that to lose,

49:14.279 --> 49:19.201
why would you get drunk
and then get behind the wheel of a car?

49:23.205 --> 49:27.793
Yep. Well, there you have it.
I'm an alcoholic.

49:28.335 --> 49:31.004
I'm Richard, alcoholic.

49:37.719 --> 49:42.683
Yeah? Jakey? Jake, no, no, no.
No, Jakey, just tell him...

49:42.808 --> 49:44.418
Just tell him...

49:44.518 --> 49:46.603
Tell him just to calm down.

49:46.728 --> 49:49.189
Okay, no more cellphones.

49:50.899 --> 49:53.010
I'm here, I'm here. It's okay.

49:53.110 --> 49:57.030
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry. Don't worry.

49:57.155 --> 50:02.703
I know. I know. Come on, Jakey, calm down.
Calm down. Just breathe. There you go.

50:03.412 --> 50:06.106
Breathe, breathe, relax.

50:06.206 --> 50:09.443
- Use your words.
- I... I had a bad dream.

50:09.543 --> 50:11.153
- Okay.
- Then I woke up...

50:11.253 --> 50:14.923
and Mommy wasn't here,
and you were gone and...

50:15.549 --> 50:18.093
I'm really sorry. Okay.

50:18.552 --> 50:21.079
Hey, you know what we're gonna do?

50:21.179 --> 50:24.683
We're gonna blow
that bad dream away, okay?

50:34.985 --> 50:37.237
Here, let me catch it.

50:43.118 --> 50:47.080
Okay. Give us a hug.
All right, where's Teddy?

50:48.123 --> 50:49.916
There he is!

50:53.044 --> 50:56.256
All right, let's go to sleep.
Come on, say good night.

50:56.381 --> 50:57.424
Good night.

51:09.436 --> 51:13.799
There you go, my little warrior poet.
Go to sleep.

51:13.899 --> 51:19.738
Dad, you and Mom are never going
to live together, are you?

51:21.031 --> 51:23.784
No, I'm sorry.

51:23.909 --> 51:27.062
But if you're ever upset about anything,

51:27.162 --> 51:31.775
anything at all, you go talk
to your mum or talk to me.

51:31.875 --> 51:34.211
Or Brian?

51:34.753 --> 51:37.589
Only if I'm stuck down a mine
and your mom's in a coma.

51:44.888 --> 51:47.916
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

51:48.016 --> 51:49.459
I...

51:49.559 --> 51:52.921
- I was completely useless.
- No, It's okay.

51:53.021 --> 51:55.757
I can't even take care
of my little sister's child.

51:55.857 --> 51:58.818
I mean, how hard can that be, right?

51:58.944 --> 52:03.114
Have you ever felt like everybody else
has gotten their shit together but you?

52:03.240 --> 52:07.436
I mean, my little sister has.
Even you have.

52:07.536 --> 52:10.455
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

52:10.580 --> 52:14.042
Look, it's just a lot different
when it's your own kid.

52:14.918 --> 52:18.296
Well, I wouldn't know about that either.

52:18.505 --> 52:20.840
Listen, I made some soup.

52:20.966 --> 52:25.095
- Would you like some? It's horrible.
- Sure. I love horrible soup.

52:31.309 --> 52:34.254
It's horrible. I can't even make a soup.

52:34.354 --> 52:35.730
Oh, boy.

52:37.899 --> 52:42.095
- You know, you're a really good father.
- Yeah. Sure I am.

52:42.195 --> 52:45.907
Richard, I'm giving you a compliment.
Just say thank you.

52:46.366 --> 52:47.867
Thank you, Olivia.

52:49.911 --> 52:52.455
I like it when you say my name.

52:53.498 --> 52:55.500
It's funny.

52:55.792 --> 52:59.963
Most women adore me to begin with,
and then end up hating me.

53:01.006 --> 53:04.676
You, on the other hand, hated me right off
the bat, but now I think you despise me.

53:04.801 --> 53:08.413
No, I despised you at the beginning.

53:08.513 --> 53:13.518
Now, I just loathe you
a little sometimes.

53:16.730 --> 53:18.523
Well.

53:42.589 --> 53:45.800
<i>I've been staying inside</i>

53:46.426 --> 53:49.637
<i>Watching from the outside</i>

53:50.138 --> 53:53.641
<i>My God, it's been a long time</i>

53:54.017 --> 53:56.603
<i>For sure</i>

53:57.687 --> 54:01.149
<i>I've been reaching for my west side</i>

54:01.524 --> 54:05.069
<i>'Cause it used to be my best side</i>

54:05.195 --> 54:08.364
<i>Now it's a part of me I can't find</i>

54:09.699 --> 54:11.326
<i>Anymore</i>

54:13.578 --> 54:15.997
<i>I wanna fly...</i>

54:17.832 --> 54:22.462
I packed your toothbrush, your pajamas,

54:22.587 --> 54:24.130
and...

54:24.589 --> 54:27.033
Hey, guys, what's happening?

54:27.133 --> 54:28.743
- Where you going?
- My sleepover!

54:28.843 --> 54:31.329
Oh, yeah! The sleepover,
of course. All right.

54:31.429 --> 54:35.333
Well, give me a kiss and have
a good night. There you go, soldier.

54:35.433 --> 54:37.085
- Cool!
- Have fun, Jakey!

54:37.185 --> 54:39.713
- Let's go.
- Good night.

54:39.813 --> 54:42.106
Enjoy your night off.

55:19.227 --> 55:20.895
Hello?

55:23.398 --> 55:27.235
Oh, there he is! What's up, Rich?

55:27.694 --> 55:29.529
Hi, Richard!

55:31.781 --> 55:34.033
Yeah, great, well done.

55:34.242 --> 55:37.829
Leaving now. Yeah, good.
Sorry about that.

55:40.665 --> 55:41.833
Yeah.

55:43.418 --> 55:45.503
He's a little weird.

55:46.963 --> 55:50.158
- Bye!
- Hey, I'll be back for more?

55:50.258 --> 55:52.343
Bye, babes!

55:53.136 --> 55:54.971
Had to leave early, did he?

55:55.763 --> 55:59.209
Well, he did stay
until he got the job done.

55:59.309 --> 56:02.770
- That was good of him.
- Yeah, he's gonna come back tomorrow

56:02.895 --> 56:05.548
and bring a friend
so we can all do it together.

56:05.648 --> 56:08.109
- The more the merrier.
- For Christ's sake.

56:08.234 --> 56:11.529
We were working,
and then he went surfing, you idiot.

56:11.654 --> 56:15.241
Now where is that bottle of wine?
I could use a drink.

56:17.410 --> 56:19.454
Come on up.

56:29.464 --> 56:30.715
There you go.

56:32.133 --> 56:35.887
- Apology accepted.
- Oh, good.

56:36.137 --> 56:39.390
- To friends.
- To friends.

56:44.854 --> 56:47.215
A bit old for homework, aren't you?

56:47.315 --> 56:52.070
Well, it's never too late to perfect
new ways of boring one's students.

56:54.238 --> 56:58.434
So... must be very excited
to have Tim all over you.

56:58.534 --> 57:01.370
So to speak. About your book.

57:02.830 --> 57:04.582
Well...

57:05.374 --> 57:08.294
tonight he tore me to pieces.

57:08.586 --> 57:10.655
It's hard to be judged by others.

57:10.755 --> 57:14.867
It's very difficult...
to stay true to your own voice

57:14.967 --> 57:18.513
when everybody else
wants you to do something else.

57:20.098 --> 57:22.016
It made me think of Alan.

57:22.517 --> 57:25.712
All the notes that I gave him
through the years.

57:25.812 --> 57:28.147
It must have tortured him.

57:28.272 --> 57:30.566
So it's not all bad, then.

57:32.235 --> 57:35.888
I'll be honest, I always thought
he was an arrogant little shit

57:35.988 --> 57:38.699
whose books were vapid and hackneyed.

57:39.867 --> 57:42.954
And all I could ever think about
when I skim-read them...

57:44.622 --> 57:47.458
- was you.
- Me?

57:48.000 --> 57:49.377
You.

57:50.127 --> 57:51.696
Yes.

57:51.796 --> 57:53.130
And what could have been worse?

57:53.256 --> 57:58.302
Being married to him
or editing his schmaltzy drivel?

58:00.388 --> 58:03.099
They both sucked.

58:05.142 --> 58:07.603
Do you know who he's screwing?

58:08.145 --> 58:10.882
My gynecologist.

58:10.982 --> 58:13.509
My gynecologist!

58:13.609 --> 58:15.052
I mean,

58:15.152 --> 58:18.764
I actually thought that he was coming
to our appointments because he cared,

58:18.864 --> 58:21.075
but no, he wanted to see the doctor.

58:21.200 --> 58:23.869
Maybe you're better off without him.

58:23.995 --> 58:26.038
Think about it.

58:26.163 --> 58:30.543
You're smart, you're funny,
you're beautiful, terrible driver, but...

58:31.252 --> 58:34.338
I'm sure you'll find someone
to overlook that.

58:34.714 --> 58:36.782
You're just saying that.

58:36.882 --> 58:40.595
Well, you are smart, you are funny,

58:40.720 --> 58:43.723
and you are very, very beautiful.

59:39.487 --> 59:41.472
- What the hell happened to my car?
- Oh, shit.

59:41.572 --> 59:45.534
Oh, my nuts! They said they
weren't coming back until tonight!

59:45.659 --> 59:49.455
- It's a good thing it's a military vehicle.
- Oh, my God!

59:49.997 --> 59:53.918
Okay, okay. To the house. To the house.

59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.509
- <i>Buenos dÃ­as, Pedro.</i>
- <i>Buenos dÃ­as, seÃ±ora.</i>

01:00:05.304 --> 01:00:07.248
Get the keys, sweetie.

01:00:07.348 --> 01:00:10.768
Oh, you know what,
I think I left my phone in the car.

01:00:22.279 --> 01:00:24.306
- Hi!
- You're naked.

01:00:24.406 --> 01:00:27.868
If you're wondering where Jake is,
he's at a sleepover with Josh.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.288
- Why are you naked?
- Richard's sleeping in his house.

01:00:31.413 --> 01:00:34.416
- I'm just gonna go and swim.
- Unbelievable.

01:00:37.628 --> 01:00:39.964
Hey, how's the lecture coming?

01:00:40.089 --> 01:00:43.217
I've passed kidney stones
with greater ease.

01:00:43.968 --> 01:00:48.597
Well, don't overthink it.
Just be honest, pithy, simple.

01:00:49.098 --> 01:00:53.978
You know something? I think you're the first
woman I've ever really been friends with.

01:00:54.103 --> 01:00:56.756
Well, that's a little sad, Richard,
but very touching.

01:00:56.856 --> 01:01:00.276
What brought about this sudden
onset of sincerity?

01:01:02.903 --> 01:01:05.765
I slept with someone,

01:01:05.865 --> 01:01:07.491
and...

01:01:08.075 --> 01:01:10.411
it actually meant something.

01:01:10.619 --> 01:01:13.147
Well, that's great. Who?

01:01:13.247 --> 01:01:14.957
Olivia.

01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:20.404
Are you kidding? Richard, why don't you go
down to your Green Card appointment,

01:01:20.504 --> 01:01:23.365
take out your samurai sword,
and disembowel yourself?

01:01:23.465 --> 01:01:26.660
What is wrong with you?
Are you trying to get deported?

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.080
- I mean, Kate is going to kill you!
- Kate's not going to know about it, is she?

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.349
I mean, I'm not going to tell her,
and Olivia's not going to tell her.

01:01:32.474 --> 01:01:37.187
They are sisters, Richard,
close sisters, and close sisters talk.

01:01:41.275 --> 01:01:43.319
You better move.

01:01:53.537 --> 01:01:56.165
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:02:03.631 --> 01:02:04.798
- Kate, hi.
- Hey!

01:02:04.923 --> 01:02:08.052
- How's everything? Good?
- Olivia told me everything.

01:02:08.218 --> 01:02:10.287
Oh, she did?

01:02:10.387 --> 01:02:13.265
I think it's awesome
that she started writing.

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:17.686
And she said you were really nice
to her when I was away.

01:02:17.811 --> 01:02:20.147
Oh, wonderful.

01:02:20.648 --> 01:02:24.343
You know... I know I've been
kind of a bitch to you lately.

01:02:24.443 --> 01:02:25.444
Oh, that's okay.

01:02:25.569 --> 01:02:30.032
Threatening not to come to your green card
meeting was totally out of line. I'm sorry.

01:02:30.157 --> 01:02:33.202
Yeah, live and let live,
forgive and forget, all of that.

01:02:33.327 --> 01:02:35.729
- We're cool?
- We are so cool.

01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:38.357
Okay. Do you want
to get me some lemonade?

01:02:38.457 --> 01:02:39.692
- Good idea.
- Thanks.

01:02:39.792 --> 01:02:42.461
Okay. Great.

01:02:52.221 --> 01:02:54.223
You smoke?

01:02:58.977 --> 01:03:02.815
- I can't stop thinking about last night.
- Nor can I.

01:03:04.608 --> 01:03:06.635
- We have to tell her.
- No, no, no.

01:03:06.735 --> 01:03:08.946
- This is not good timing. Olivia, Olivia.
- Dad?

01:03:09.071 --> 01:03:11.265
That's gone to your head. Get back
in the bush. Get behind the bush.

01:03:11.365 --> 01:03:14.518
There's a funny old man here
that wants to see you.

01:03:14.618 --> 01:03:16.286
What?

01:03:17.246 --> 01:03:19.023
Dad, what are you doing here?

01:03:19.123 --> 01:03:23.418
Why in buggering hell
have you been ignoring my calls?

01:03:24.044 --> 01:03:27.698
Oh, hello, this must be the Yank totty!

01:03:27.798 --> 01:03:30.175
Kate, my father.

01:03:30.801 --> 01:03:32.953
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Haig!

01:03:33.053 --> 01:03:36.165
It's so nice to meet you!

01:03:36.265 --> 01:03:39.585
- Sorry, I'm soaking wet.
- I need a shower anyway.

01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:42.880
Oh, and who is this other vision
of loveliness?

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:46.550
I'm Olivia. I'm Kate's sister.

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:48.986
Blimey. Bookends.

01:03:49.403 --> 01:03:51.989
Well, come inside,
I'll make you up a room.

01:03:52.114 --> 01:03:54.658
No, no, no, it's okay. Dad, come with me.
Come to the guesthouse.

01:03:54.783 --> 01:03:58.036
- We've got plenty of rooms.
- No, that's okay. Dad, come with me.

01:03:58.162 --> 01:04:00.564
- Are you sure?
- You're staying with me. I promise you.

01:04:00.664 --> 01:04:02.791
- Nice to meet you!
- You too!

01:04:02.916 --> 01:04:07.713
- Why exactly are you here?
- I'm visiting you and the little turd...

01:04:07.838 --> 01:04:13.660
- Fella. What's it bloody look like?
- Well, I don't really know. I mean...

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.330
Jake, meet your grandfather.

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:18.582
Yeah. I'm your granddad.

01:04:18.682 --> 01:04:21.627
I've got something for you
that I brought all the way from England.

01:04:21.727 --> 01:04:27.466
Would you like to see it?
Now that is a model of "HMS Defiance."

01:04:27.566 --> 01:04:29.902
God, Dad. You never let me
used to touch that.

01:04:30.027 --> 01:04:32.321
- What?
- Okay, I'll be right back.

01:04:32.446 --> 01:04:34.848
Hey! Wait a minute, where are you going?

01:04:34.948 --> 01:04:38.101
You can't bear to be in the same room
with me for two minutes, is that it?

01:04:38.201 --> 01:04:41.121
- No, that's not it, Dad, not at all!
- Can I keep it?

01:04:41.413 --> 01:04:44.458
Of course you can bloody keep it.
It's yours!

01:04:44.583 --> 01:04:48.587
But don't put it in the bath,
because it'll sink.

01:04:51.632 --> 01:04:53.926
- Hey, cool!
- Where should we put it? Here?

01:04:54.051 --> 01:04:56.595
- On the top!
- Yes, on the top!

01:04:58.513 --> 01:05:00.582
Hello, my lovelies.

01:05:00.682 --> 01:05:04.603
All I'm asking is, can you wait
till Monday morning at 11:00?

01:05:05.479 --> 01:05:07.189
Why?

01:05:07.314 --> 01:05:09.608
My green card interview.

01:05:10.984 --> 01:05:12.803
After that...

01:05:12.903 --> 01:05:14.905
you can...

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:17.824
tell her what you like, okay?

01:05:36.093 --> 01:05:37.761
Dad...

01:05:38.345 --> 01:05:41.348
- I need to go pee.
- Come on, then.

01:05:41.723 --> 01:05:44.835
Hey, where the bloody hell
are you two going? Come on, hey!

01:05:44.935 --> 01:05:49.089
- We're going to go for a pee, Dad.
- Come on, whip it out. Come on!

01:05:49.189 --> 01:05:52.634
- Dad, you can't pee off the pier.
- Jake, who are you going to listen to?

01:05:52.734 --> 01:05:57.347
Your dad, who, for some buggering reason
has turned into a boring old fart,

01:05:57.447 --> 01:06:00.826
or your grandfather,
who's lived a rich and full life

01:06:00.951 --> 01:06:03.578
and doesn't take shite from anybody?

01:06:05.622 --> 01:06:08.108
You! Sorry, Dad.

01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:12.362
There you go, come on up here.
There you go. Up you go.

01:06:12.462 --> 01:06:16.700
Come on, you too.
If you're still my son, that is.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.263
All right, on three. One, two, three.

01:06:21.388 --> 01:06:24.391
Yeah! That's it.

01:06:29.396 --> 01:06:33.567
Well, somebody had
their vitamins this morning.

01:06:35.652 --> 01:06:38.347
You know, there are coconuts over there!

01:06:38.447 --> 01:06:40.657
Great isn't it? There you go.

01:06:41.741 --> 01:06:45.645
Beautiful. Oh, dear.
All right, all right, all right.

01:06:45.745 --> 01:06:49.708
That's good stuff.
Put on some tunes, guys?

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:54.838
Oh, look at this. This is paradise, man.
You've ended up in paradise!

01:06:54.963 --> 01:06:58.300
You know, they must be freezing
their bollocks off in England.

01:07:01.219 --> 01:07:03.638
Why are you really here?

01:07:10.562 --> 01:07:14.858
Joan left me. Silly cow.

01:07:15.525 --> 01:07:19.613
Well, I'm sorry. Truly.

01:07:20.447 --> 01:07:25.185
Well, that makes me feel so much better.

01:07:25.285 --> 01:07:30.315
I mean, God almighty, thank you
for those profound words of sympathy.

01:07:30.415 --> 01:07:33.401
Well, it's a lot more than you
ever said when Kate left me.

01:07:33.501 --> 01:07:35.420
Well, I warned you about her!

01:07:35.545 --> 01:07:38.131
She was a rampant little Yankee trollop.

01:07:39.633 --> 01:07:42.577
You know what, Dad?
Of course Joan left you.

01:07:42.677 --> 01:07:46.623
You're a misanthropic, misogynistic asshole
who doesn't give a fuck about anybody,

01:07:46.723 --> 01:07:51.127
least of all the poor saps who you got
to marry you in the first place.

01:07:51.227 --> 01:07:54.606
Is that it? Is that all you've got?

01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:59.069
And you did it all in the name
of some misguided credo called fun.

01:07:59.194 --> 01:08:01.304
Which you brainwashed me
with in the first place.

01:08:01.404 --> 01:08:03.990
Guys, dig this song!

01:08:04.282 --> 01:08:05.367
Bugger off.

01:08:08.745 --> 01:08:11.189
That's it then, is it, boy wonder?

01:08:11.289 --> 01:08:15.068
So you finally got it
off your chest, have you?

01:08:15.168 --> 01:08:17.337
You know what, Dad?

01:08:17.837 --> 01:08:20.631
Why don't you just bugger off for once?

01:08:20.756 --> 01:08:22.300
For once...

01:08:22.425 --> 01:08:25.845
why don't you be the one to bugger off?

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:58.545
Brian, go back to my wife.

01:08:58.877 --> 01:09:00.613
Go on.

01:09:00.714 --> 01:09:04.283
Go on, just... just go back.

01:09:04.384 --> 01:09:06.411
Thank you for that wonderful sharing.

01:09:06.511 --> 01:09:10.807
Seriously, this has been
absolutely a marvelous session.

01:09:10.932 --> 01:09:14.310
I've learned so much.
Give yourselves a big hand. Everybody.

01:09:14.435 --> 01:09:17.020
Wendy, I was wondering
if you could sign my form

01:09:17.147 --> 01:09:19.732
to show that I've done the 10 sessions?

01:09:21.234 --> 01:09:23.778
I'm sorry, Richard, I can't.

01:09:25.363 --> 01:09:30.033
Why? I mean, I came,
I did the whole "I'm an alcoholic..."

01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:33.621
But it's not about
just saying the words.

01:09:33.746 --> 01:09:36.791
You have to actually mean them.

01:09:42.881 --> 01:09:45.425
Great seeing you. Thanks so much.

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:50.180
Cindy, right?

01:09:50.305 --> 01:09:53.725
I just spent the last week listening
to that drivel so some witless little ninny

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.836
won't sign a piece of paper
to say I'm an okay kind of guy.

01:09:56.936 --> 01:10:00.356
Absolute bollocks. Sorry, excuse me.

01:10:01.274 --> 01:10:03.510
Hey, you want to get a drink?
Actually, maybe not.

01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:06.237
I've got a grueling lecture in an hour.

01:10:06.362 --> 01:10:09.199
How about a joint?
Just kidding, bad joke.

01:10:09.324 --> 01:10:13.536
I didn't want my son to find it.
I don't touch the stuff. It's my dad's.

01:10:13.912 --> 01:10:15.788
Likes to puff.

01:10:16.456 --> 01:10:19.876
- Good luck with your lecture.
- Thank you.

01:10:27.967 --> 01:10:31.121
I want you all to imagine
you're at Cambridge University.

01:10:31.221 --> 01:10:33.556
The year is 1807.

01:10:33.681 --> 01:10:35.917
You walk across the quad
of Trinity College.

01:10:36.017 --> 01:10:40.380
Into the lecture hall, you find
your fellow classmate, Lord Byron,

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.193
who, in defiance
of college rules about dogs,

01:10:45.318 --> 01:10:48.446
has brought a bear to class instead.

01:11:03.086 --> 01:11:05.296
You know what?

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.757
Forget about that.

01:11:07.882 --> 01:11:11.636
Why are the Romantics relevant today?

01:11:14.973 --> 01:11:16.724
Honestly...

01:11:16.849 --> 01:11:18.518
they're not.

01:11:19.978 --> 01:11:21.880
Stacy got it right.

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:26.134
And Dwight, he can't stop thinking
about home runs and fastballs

01:11:26.234 --> 01:11:28.945
when he reads Byron and Coleridge.

01:11:32.824 --> 01:11:34.492
Because...

01:11:35.284 --> 01:11:37.370
we're teaching words.

01:11:38.496 --> 01:11:40.123
Words.

01:11:40.915 --> 01:11:43.459
But we're not teaching meaning.

01:11:45.044 --> 01:11:47.130
I got it all wrong.

01:11:47.547 --> 01:11:52.009
I can tell you about Byron and his bear,
Wordsworth falling in love with his cousin,

01:11:52.135 --> 01:11:55.455
Coleridge falling in love with cocaine.

01:11:55.555 --> 01:11:58.433
I can tell you what's behind
the words from them,

01:11:59.058 --> 01:12:02.478
but I can't tell you what's behind
those words for you.

01:12:03.354 --> 01:12:06.899
Because this class is about you

01:12:07.024 --> 01:12:09.610
learning to find your own meaning.

01:12:10.945 --> 01:12:13.030
Your own voices.

01:12:15.241 --> 01:12:19.103
Go read the poems.
But know this, that at this moment,

01:12:19.203 --> 01:12:24.233
you are the Romantics,
you are the relevant ones.

01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:28.780
Let Byron, Coleridge, Wordsworth
inspire you to do your thing,

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.631
to go your own way.

01:12:30.757 --> 01:12:33.676
Stacy, quit texting.
Call him, right now.

01:12:34.135 --> 01:12:38.164
Dwight, go play ball.
Ignore anyone who says no, you can't.

01:12:38.264 --> 01:12:42.810
Follow your hearts. Do good things,
be bold, and, above all else...

01:12:44.103 --> 01:12:45.980
stick it to the man.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:52.136
Well, Dad, I totally fucked up
my audition lecture.

01:12:52.236 --> 01:12:56.474
I stuck it to them all right.
I stuck it to myself in the process, too.

01:12:56.574 --> 01:13:01.062
Hey, listen, you silly old sod,
you just bolted before I could apologize.

01:13:01.162 --> 01:13:04.190
Why are you so thin-skinned these days?

01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:07.001
All right, call me back.

01:13:21.933 --> 01:13:24.961
$4,000 should cover it.

01:13:25.061 --> 01:13:26.212
What?

01:13:26.312 --> 01:13:30.608
Your Mustang, Richard, it's got Sienna Red
paint there all over the back fender.

01:13:30.733 --> 01:13:32.635
Unmistakable.

01:13:32.735 --> 01:13:36.514
1954 MG TFs do not come cheap,
my friend.

01:13:36.614 --> 01:13:38.991
Absolutely not. Can I give you a check?

01:13:39.116 --> 01:13:41.118
I would prefer cash.

01:13:44.622 --> 01:13:47.358
Wanted to be the first
to congratulate you.

01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:50.570
Welcome to the English department,
University of Los Angeles.

01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:52.697
Yes!

01:13:52.797 --> 01:13:55.658
Oh, good. Oh, thank you, boss.

01:13:55.758 --> 01:13:57.927
I guess we'll do the other side as well.

01:13:58.052 --> 01:14:00.454
- Let's go have a pint.
- A pint of what? Oil?

01:14:00.554 --> 01:14:04.642
A pint of what... Witty.
I'll always laugh at your jokes.

01:14:13.067 --> 01:14:16.345
I got the job. ULA!
Knocked it out of the ballpark.

01:14:16.445 --> 01:14:19.265
- Congratulations!
- Home run! Fantastic!

01:14:19.365 --> 01:14:22.894
And I feel fantastic about you
and what we did, making love.

01:14:22.994 --> 01:14:24.562
No, listen please. Hear me out.

01:14:24.662 --> 01:14:27.023
Kate and I have been separated
for two years.

01:14:27.123 --> 01:14:30.067
Why should we feel bad?
We're grownups, you know.

01:14:30.167 --> 01:14:34.196
And if Kate doesn't like it, she can
bloody well just go... Hey, you. Brian.

01:14:34.296 --> 01:14:37.591
Okay, okay, in the vault.

01:14:39.677 --> 01:14:41.762
Oh, Kate.

01:14:43.889 --> 01:14:45.558
Olivia.

01:14:46.559 --> 01:14:48.436
My best friend.

01:14:49.395 --> 01:14:52.023
Total trust.

01:14:52.148 --> 01:14:54.191
No secrets!

01:14:54.567 --> 01:14:58.529
- We were going to...
- You know what? If you want him, take him.

01:14:58.946 --> 01:15:00.322
But get out of my house.

01:15:01.574 --> 01:15:04.618
Well, now, maybe... okay.

01:15:38.986 --> 01:15:40.654
Thank you.

01:15:41.197 --> 01:15:43.866
Ernesto. Sorry I'm late.

01:15:44.366 --> 01:15:47.912
- Where's your wife?
- Not coming. Sends her regards.

01:15:49.288 --> 01:15:51.691
Okay, strike one, she's not here.

01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:55.361
Strike two, you failed
the recovery program.

01:15:55.461 --> 01:15:58.030
We may be 0-2, but we're going
to swing for the fences

01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:00.466
on the University of Los Angeles.

01:16:00.591 --> 01:16:01.509
Morning, officer Lewis.

01:16:01.634 --> 01:16:04.678
Why has it taken nearly three years
to schedule this interview?

01:16:04.803 --> 01:16:08.140
Well, my client never received
all the notifications from ICE.

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:12.211
Is this your handwriting, Mr. Haig?

01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:16.090
Some of it is.
Some of it's also my son's.

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:18.426
Working on his cursive.

01:16:18.526 --> 01:16:20.277
Can you explain this?

01:16:20.653 --> 01:16:24.390
Yes, well, that's not my fault.
Painkillers, dental surgery.

01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:27.935
My client's done 10 sessions of a recovery
program to show his good character.

01:16:28.035 --> 01:16:31.580
Where's the letter of completion?
In the mail, with "bew-locks" written on it?

01:16:32.289 --> 01:16:34.984
It's "bollocks," actually.

01:16:35.084 --> 01:16:37.127
Officer Armstrong!

01:16:42.508 --> 01:16:47.596
Please describe how Mr. Haig
tried to offer you marijuana.

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:53.352
The other night, as I was leaving
the recovery center,

01:16:53.477 --> 01:16:56.563
Mr. Haig asked me
if I wanted some marijuana.

01:16:58.190 --> 01:17:03.470
Under California law, the possession
of marijuana is a felony.

01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:05.322
That's true.

01:17:05.447 --> 01:17:07.658
What is it you say, Mr. Haig? Cheerios?

01:17:09.618 --> 01:17:12.646
There you have it, the whole sorry saga.

01:17:12.746 --> 01:17:17.501
Ernesto did do one thing
to justify his exorbitant fee.

01:17:18.752 --> 01:17:21.213
He got me this one hour with you.

01:17:22.089 --> 01:17:25.034
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Jake.

01:17:25.134 --> 01:17:27.469
- Time's up.
- Jake, please.

01:17:34.601 --> 01:17:36.937
I love you. Do you hear me?
I am so sorry.

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:22.608
"That is no country for old men.

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:28.363
The young in one another's arms,

01:18:28.947 --> 01:18:30.808
birds in the trees,

01:18:30.908 --> 01:18:34.745
those dying generations...
at their song."

01:18:35.621 --> 01:18:37.564
So, what's Yeats saying here?

01:18:37.664 --> 01:18:42.277
He's a 60-year-old man looking
at young people screwing and living,

01:18:42.377 --> 01:18:45.422
blissfully unthinking
about their own mortality.

01:18:45.839 --> 01:18:48.258
Yeats knows he's just an aged man,

01:18:49.176 --> 01:18:51.787
but his dreams...

01:18:51.887 --> 01:18:53.847
are of Byzantium.

01:19:00.979 --> 01:19:02.689
- Hello?
- <i>This is Memorial General.</i>

01:19:02.815 --> 01:19:05.484
<i>We need to talk to you
about your father.</i>

01:19:40.852 --> 01:19:44.231
What the buggering hell
are you doing here?

01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:47.025
You hate hospitals.

01:19:47.234 --> 01:19:49.219
You're right.

01:19:49.319 --> 01:19:52.097
I hate bloody hospitals.

01:19:52.197 --> 01:19:55.117
But I love the nurses.

01:20:01.039 --> 01:20:03.333
How's my little Jake?

01:20:06.587 --> 01:20:08.880
He's all right, Dad.

01:20:10.382 --> 01:20:12.426
You know, I...

01:20:13.802 --> 01:20:17.097
I don't think I could have done
what you did.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.353
You stuck with that boy
through all the muck and bullets.

01:20:26.106 --> 01:20:29.067
You're a better man than I, Gunga Din.

01:20:34.364 --> 01:20:36.783
I don't know about that, Dad.

01:20:37.743 --> 01:20:41.705
You still shagging the...
Yank totty's sister, are we?

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:44.041
No, I blew that one.

01:20:46.418 --> 01:20:49.529
Threw away a pearl beyond price.

01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:53.342
Totty and Totty's sister.

01:20:53.467 --> 01:20:57.012
None of us are talking.
It's all a big mess.

01:21:04.561 --> 01:21:09.232
Marvelous bloody place,
though, isn't it? Californ-i-a?

01:21:10.776 --> 01:21:15.781
Sunshine, beaches, and girls. Yeah.

01:21:17.157 --> 01:21:19.242
Marijuana.

01:21:19.367 --> 01:21:22.954
God, how the buggering hell
did I miss out on all that for so long?

01:21:23.538 --> 01:21:25.457
You came.

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:28.251
You saw it once.

01:21:31.088 --> 01:21:34.174
It all goes so fast.

01:21:36.051 --> 01:21:39.304
These buggers here,
they don't think I've got long.

01:21:42.265 --> 01:21:43.892
Well...

01:21:44.184 --> 01:21:46.353
it's all a load of bollocks, really.

01:21:46.937 --> 01:21:48.647
What is?

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:54.027
You know, there's nothing honorable
in misery, Richard.

01:21:55.028 --> 01:21:57.723
Carpe diem.

01:21:57.823 --> 01:22:01.368
Boff and be merry.

01:22:01.868 --> 01:22:05.731
Now, listen. You listen to me carefully.

01:22:05.831 --> 01:22:11.419
This might be the most important
bit of advice I'll ever give you.

01:22:16.299 --> 01:22:18.552
For God's sake, man...

01:22:18.677 --> 01:22:21.346
go and get your bloody girl.

01:22:21.805 --> 01:22:23.682
Go on.

01:22:24.391 --> 01:22:26.434
Bugger off.

01:22:38.655 --> 01:22:40.657
Hey, Richard.

01:22:43.034 --> 01:22:45.328
You remember my epitaph.

01:22:47.163 --> 01:22:49.124
Of course I do, Dad.

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.711
Of course I do.

01:23:54.481 --> 01:23:57.942
Byzantium is the place he longs for.

01:23:58.276 --> 01:24:00.595
He needs to make this journey.

01:24:00.695 --> 01:24:04.224
I'm going to sort this all out.
I promise you. Okay, Jake?

01:24:04.324 --> 01:24:05.784
<i>How?</i>

01:24:08.161 --> 01:24:10.330
I'll Skype you tomorrow, okay?

01:24:18.546 --> 01:24:20.090
Is she talking to Olivia yet?

01:24:20.215 --> 01:24:23.426
<i>Olivia's book launches here next week.
Kate isn't even going.</i>

01:24:24.302 --> 01:24:27.764
- <i>She's icing everyone out, even me.</i>
- All right.

01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:29.624
See ya, Brian.

01:24:29.724 --> 01:24:32.585
Yeats knows that unless
he makes this journey,

01:24:32.685 --> 01:24:36.940
unless he defies logic and authority,

01:24:37.148 --> 01:24:41.986
unless his soul claps hands
and sings out loud...

01:24:44.864 --> 01:24:47.242
he is nothing more...

01:24:47.951 --> 01:24:51.329
than a tattered coat upon a stick.

01:25:19.524 --> 01:25:21.943
You old bugger.

01:25:25.154 --> 01:25:28.032
There is a country for old men.

01:25:30.702 --> 01:25:32.871
If not now, when?

01:25:34.122 --> 01:25:39.294
Ernesto, Richard Haig. <i>CÃ³mo estÃ¡?</i>

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.144
<i>Adios! Adios, amigos.</i>

01:26:48.905 --> 01:26:51.449
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Hi, Jakey.</i>

01:26:51.574 --> 01:26:53.701
<i>Go to the door and tell me what you see.</i>

01:26:53.826 --> 01:26:55.578
Okay.

01:27:03.252 --> 01:27:07.423
Oh, look at you, boy! Oh, look at you.

01:27:07.548 --> 01:27:09.300
Richie!

01:27:12.011 --> 01:27:15.598
Thank God you're here, dude.
Thank God. Thank God.

01:27:15.723 --> 01:27:19.018
- You can let go now, Brian. That's okay.
- Okay. All right. Okay.

01:27:20.019 --> 01:27:22.397
Can you believe it, Mom?
He's really here.

01:27:22.688 --> 01:27:26.192
- Hi, Kate.
- Hey, how did you get here?

01:27:26.317 --> 01:27:29.220
I just came across the border.
It's an old trick of mine.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:33.141
- What if you get caught?
- I won't. I'll be gone before they know it.

01:27:33.241 --> 01:27:37.937
Remember my lawyer, Ernesto? He's going
to sort this whole mess out, okay?

01:27:38.037 --> 01:27:39.647
- Yay!
- Don't you worry.

01:27:39.747 --> 01:27:41.816
It's only going to cost me a fortune.

01:27:41.916 --> 01:27:45.278
And look, Kate,
we can't keep going like this.

01:27:45.378 --> 01:27:49.924
I mean, Jake, he needs his mom
and dad to be adults, right?

01:27:50.424 --> 01:27:52.093
Yeah.

01:27:53.344 --> 01:27:56.706
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry we hurt you.

01:27:56.806 --> 01:28:00.935
Olivia wanted to tell you,
and it was my fault she didn't.

01:28:01.435 --> 01:28:05.298
But you're sisters. Come on.
Cut her some slack.

01:28:05.398 --> 01:28:07.900
Life is so short, Kate.

01:28:08.609 --> 01:28:11.779
Like my dad used to say, carpe diem.

01:28:11.904 --> 01:28:14.532
Let's boff and be merry?

01:28:16.826 --> 01:28:19.353
- Okay.
- Great.

01:28:19.453 --> 01:28:22.748
Great. And... one last thing.

01:28:23.166 --> 01:28:26.586
- Can I take a shower, please?
- He really stinks.

01:28:27.962 --> 01:28:33.159
Thank you, everybody, for coming.
I would like to thank my agent,

01:28:33.259 --> 01:28:34.827
Tim Prince.

01:28:34.927 --> 01:28:37.914
I would also like to thank my...

01:28:38.014 --> 01:28:41.125
ex brother-in-law, Richard.

01:28:41.225 --> 01:28:44.670
He was the inspiration
for the burnt-out,

01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:49.066
recovering-alcoholic cop
who saves the day.

01:28:49.525 --> 01:28:52.236
Although he doesn't know it,
so let's not tell him.

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:58.159
And, lastly, I would like to thank
somebody very special to me

01:28:58.284 --> 01:29:01.020
who couldn't be here today,

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.041
which is nobody's fault but mine.

01:29:32.526 --> 01:29:34.904
All right. Here we are.

01:29:48.125 --> 01:29:49.794
Hey.

01:29:53.881 --> 01:29:57.118
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

01:29:57.218 --> 01:29:59.203
I'm sorry, too.

01:29:59.303 --> 01:30:01.764
Let's never fight again, okay?

01:30:02.848 --> 01:30:04.684
Come here.

01:30:13.484 --> 01:30:16.862
- Let's go back inside.
- Just give me a minute, all right?

01:30:16.987 --> 01:30:18.656
Okay.

01:30:28.833 --> 01:30:30.584
Hi.

01:30:31.919 --> 01:30:35.965
- You came.
- I came. Piece of cake.

01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:42.138
I came because I love you.

01:30:43.556 --> 01:30:45.975
I came because I need you.

01:30:47.351 --> 01:30:49.603
I need my son.

01:30:49.728 --> 01:30:51.981
I need my family.

01:30:52.106 --> 01:30:54.150
That's why I came.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:59.680
- You want to hear something crazy?
- What?

01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:01.323
I knew you'd come.

01:31:01.449 --> 01:31:04.660
- It's irrational.
- It's romantic.

01:31:05.369 --> 01:31:07.396
You and I...

01:31:07.496 --> 01:31:11.542
we've only had moments.
Now we have time.

01:31:35.858 --> 01:31:40.738
I spent my whole life
in opposition to this man.

01:31:41.947 --> 01:31:44.825
Honestly, he never did
a bloody thing for me,

01:31:45.743 --> 01:31:47.870
except this.

01:31:49.455 --> 01:31:52.374
Asking me to scatter his ashes here.

01:31:55.294 --> 01:31:57.671
And it saved my life,

01:31:59.173 --> 01:32:02.509
because it brought me back to the people
I love most in this world.

01:32:09.516 --> 01:32:13.020
- Even you, Brian.
- You're the man, Richard.

01:32:13.395 --> 01:32:17.341
There comes a time, and there's always
a time, and I guess this is the time.

01:32:17.441 --> 01:32:21.487
So, Jakey, shall we set grandpa free?

01:32:30.204 --> 01:32:32.247
Okay, Dad.

01:32:32.873 --> 01:32:35.167
Enjoy paradise.

01:32:42.758 --> 01:32:45.536
So how long are you staying?

01:32:45.636 --> 01:32:48.289
Okay, Jakey, listen to me here.

01:32:48.389 --> 01:32:50.641
I have to sort out a few things first.

01:32:52.393 --> 01:32:54.211
But...

01:32:54.311 --> 01:32:57.940
maybe marrying your aunt might help.

01:33:00.150 --> 01:33:03.696
- What?
- Well, I am down on one knee.

01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:09.993
Then get up and kiss me again.

01:33:28.554 --> 01:33:31.932
<i>Up and away we set off</i>

01:33:32.558 --> 01:33:36.270
<i>Secretly scared we'd get lost</i>

01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:40.799
<i>Up in the clouds, over the town</i>

01:33:40.899 --> 01:33:44.111
<i>Beyond the wall</i>

01:33:44.903 --> 01:33:48.490
<i>Some of us knew we might fall</i>

01:33:49.074 --> 01:33:52.619
<i>Under the weight of it all</i>

01:33:52.995 --> 01:33:57.107
<i>And though we'd been warned
of the oncoming storms</i>

01:33:57.207 --> 01:34:00.169
<i>Still we stood tall</i>

01:34:01.295 --> 01:34:05.174
<i>Soar from the moonlight</i>

01:34:05.299 --> 01:34:09.386
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

01:34:09.511 --> 01:34:13.348
<i>This will be our time</i>

01:34:13.474 --> 01:34:17.711
<i>To free-fall and nose-dive</i>

01:34:17.811 --> 01:34:21.690
<i>Out of the black night</i>

01:34:21.815 --> 01:34:25.594
<i>Into the bright light</i>

01:34:25.694 --> 01:34:29.615
<i>With the whole world in our sight</i>

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:34.119
<i>Like a miniature paradise</i>

01:34:36.246 --> 01:34:38.290
<i>Yeah</i>

01:34:50.344 --> 01:34:53.847
<i>My shadow is cast on the ground</i>

01:34:54.473 --> 01:34:58.310
<i>I'm flying too fast to look down</i>

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.671
<i>At the rooftops and trees</i>

01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:05.692
<i>And my family waving at me</i>

01:35:06.902 --> 01:35:10.848
<i>Soar from the moonlight</i>

01:35:10.948 --> 01:35:15.118
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

01:35:15.244 --> 01:35:19.106
<i>This will be our time</i>

01:35:19.206 --> 01:35:23.293
<i>To free-fall and nose-dive</i>

01:35:23.418 --> 01:35:27.447
<i>Out of the black night</i>

01:35:27.547 --> 01:35:31.159
<i>Into the bright light</i>

01:35:31.259 --> 01:35:35.222
<i>With the whole world in our sight</i>

01:35:35.347 --> 01:35:39.351
<i>Like a miniature paradise</i>

01:36:16.013 --> 01:36:20.559
<i>I go crazy sometimes</i>

01:36:20.976 --> 01:36:24.187
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

01:36:25.814 --> 01:36:28.675
<i>Yeah, I swear I'm fine</i>

01:36:28.775 --> 01:36:33.613
<i>That I'm all right
but I'm barely breathing</i>

01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:39.035
<i>Thought I could find my way back home</i>

01:36:39.536 --> 01:36:42.998
<i>But I get lost alone</i>

01:36:43.623 --> 01:36:45.834
<i>But when I'm with you</i>

01:36:45.959 --> 01:36:48.111
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>

01:36:48.211 --> 01:36:52.716
<i>And when I'm with you
I swear I can breathe</i>

01:36:52.841 --> 01:36:54.743
<i>And when I'm with you</i>

01:36:54.843 --> 01:36:59.973
<i>I know who I am and who I want to be</i>

01:37:06.104 --> 01:37:09.900
<i>I'm not trying to be dramatic, no</i>

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.029
<i>Most times I'm pretty normal</i>

01:37:16.031 --> 01:37:20.243
<i>Oh, let's be clear and honest here</i>

01:37:20.368 --> 01:37:24.247
<i>And do away with anything formal</i>

01:37:25.165 --> 01:37:29.444
<i>I can fake it on my own</i>

01:37:29.544 --> 01:37:33.465
<i>But I am lost alone</i>

01:37:33.798 --> 01:37:35.951
<i>'Cause when I'm with you</i>

01:37:36.051 --> 01:37:38.245
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>

01:37:38.345 --> 01:37:42.791
<i>And when I'm with you
I swear I can breathe</i>

01:37:42.891 --> 01:37:44.835
<i>And when I'm with you</i>

01:37:44.935 --> 01:37:50.065
<i>I know who I am and who I want to be</i>

01:37:56.279 --> 01:37:59.115
<i>Who I want to be</i>

01:38:08.291 --> 01:38:12.671
<i>But I am wide-eyed</i>

01:38:13.046 --> 01:38:15.757
<i>With a pension for running</i>

01:38:15.882 --> 01:38:18.677
<i>But how many times does it take</i>

01:38:18.802 --> 01:38:21.329
<i>Till I find that I'm lost</i>

01:38:21.429 --> 01:38:24.516
<i>When I'm alone</i>

01:38:24.641 --> 01:38:28.336
<i>And that's not where I belong</i>

01:38:28.436 --> 01:38:30.647
<i>'Cause when I'm with you</i>

01:38:30.772 --> 01:38:33.175
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>

01:38:33.275 --> 01:38:37.596
<i>When I'm with you I can finally breathe</i>

01:38:37.696 --> 01:38:39.890
<i>When I'm with you</i>

01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:42.267
<i>I swear to God</i>

01:38:42.367 --> 01:38:47.289
<i>I swear to God I'm who I wanna be</i>

01:38:48.331 --> 01:38:50.567
<i>I'm who I</i>

01:38:50.667 --> 01:38:53.962
<i>I'm who I wanna be</i>

01:38:59.801 --> 01:39:03.096
<i>I'm who I wanna be</i>

01:39:06.599 --> 01:39:08.710
<i>I'm who I</i>

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:12.480
<i>I'm who I wanna be</i>
