WEBVTT

00:09.313 --> 00:12.664
Mitch: Really don't know
where to go from here.

00:12.708 --> 00:15.798
Maybe before I move forward,

00:15.841 --> 00:17.713
I got to understand
how I got here.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.852
Franco: They were headed to
the airport, boarding a plane.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.768
Mitch: So, where's Rinaldo?
He's in Cuba?

00:29.812 --> 00:33.163
They flew to, you know,
parts unknown, offshore.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.513
You should see the footage--

00:35.557 --> 00:38.603
hookers, bottle service,
you name it.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.910
He could be a dangerous man.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.520
Mike:
About our money here,

00:42.564 --> 00:44.131
the people that I deal with,
they're a bunch of mugs.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.958
These guys want
their money back.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.351
They feel they're getting
bamboozled all over the place,

00:47.395 --> 00:49.136
right, and they don't
like doing that.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.268
- Uh, no problem.
- Mike: It's not a problem?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.096
- It's not a problem
to me, my friend.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.837
So, why don't you tell me how
we're gonna get our money back?

00:54.880 --> 00:57.144
At Harvard, we learn about
how to be a bull-shitter,

00:57.187 --> 00:58.406
how to Harvard-bullshit.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.147
You know, it's like a course.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.584
So, let's hope your "trust me"
is a guaranteed "trust me"

01:02.627 --> 01:04.281
'cause I've heard it
a million times before.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.283
Okay, don't trust me,
but I'm not going anywhere.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.024
- Mike: Thank you.
- Mitch: Okay.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.504
Mike: I'm going to take you
as a man of your word.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.375
Franco: Who's funding
this guy's fantasy life?

01:11.419 --> 01:12.985
Did you give him any money?

01:13.029 --> 01:15.423
Rinaldo wants to do his project,
wherever that is.

01:15.466 --> 01:19.296
I'm running through the books as
we're investing in his project.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.125
I'm getting out of the country

01:22.169 --> 01:24.171
and I have some time

01:24.214 --> 01:26.869
to get to know his
beautiful wife, Julianne.

01:26.912 --> 01:30.525
Well, here I was thinking
I was in control.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.532
As you know,
it's a crumbling house of cards.

01:37.575 --> 01:40.317
I think our time is done here.

01:40.361 --> 01:43.668
Just be calm.
Pretend everything's all right.

01:43.712 --> 01:46.628
If, um-- if they start
seizing the equipment,

01:46.671 --> 01:50.762
just tell 'em we don't own it.
It's leased. They can't have it.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.156
So, we better,
like, move quickly.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.724
And I see the backstairs,
so let's move quickly.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.074
You should go,
and I'll talk to Doreen.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.554
I'll make sure
she gets out of here.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.164
Doreen? Doreen?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.426
[knocking]

02:02.470 --> 02:03.819
[whispering] You got to go.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.342
They're coming for us.
You got to go.

02:05.386 --> 02:06.909
Yeah, yeah. We got to go.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.824
I would go immediately
down the staircase.

02:08.866 --> 02:12.393
I'll bring my car around and
I'll see you in the alleyway.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.265
Put the equipment in my car
and we'll keep moving.

02:15.309 --> 02:18.964
Okay. Don't look back.
We're good.

02:22.490 --> 02:25.014
Could you help me
take the sign off, actually?

02:25.057 --> 02:27.277
We don't have time.
I got to go. I got to go, guys.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.584
Well, I thought
I was in control.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.194
I thought I was the king.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.849
I thought I was
running a studio;

02:33.892 --> 02:36.765
hiring, firing, making
decisions, getting money,

02:36.808 --> 02:39.159
handing money out.

02:42.597 --> 02:52.607
â™ª

03:20.156 --> 03:22.463
So, guys,
slight little wrinkle.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.421
Some funds didn't
come in as I'd like

03:24.465 --> 03:25.901
and our lease was up,

03:25.944 --> 03:27.468
and they were taking
some of our stuff.

03:27.511 --> 03:30.993
So, I thought we'd, um,
be on the move a little bit.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.866
We're gonna, you know, try to
pull together this season

03:34.910 --> 03:37.826
in sort of a really--
how would I put it?

03:37.869 --> 03:40.655
Low-cost,
but very cost-effective way.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.353
You know, we have
some really great actors that,

03:43.397 --> 03:45.137
you know, I've e-mailed out,

03:45.181 --> 03:46.965
and hopefully
will be joining us.

03:47.009 --> 03:50.795
And I think back and probably
my closest relationship

03:50.839 --> 03:53.407
throughout this whole project
was with Franco.

03:55.060 --> 03:58.107
So, I have an idea.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.501
I'm going to call Franco.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.113
I liked him,
I didn't like him.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.636
We're friends,
we're not friends.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.986
He relied up on me,
I relied upon him.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.771
We're not in our old studio,

04:09.814 --> 04:11.338
but we're moving into
another studio.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.209
But we thought we'd really
go guerrilla filmmaking,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.951
out on the street,
doing stuff together.

04:15.994 --> 04:18.475
So, you know-- Franco?

04:18.519 --> 04:21.696
And I was just
his little bitch. Wow.

04:21.738 --> 04:23.872
I think one of the best ideas is
we're just gonna, like, wing it.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.613
And we have a few ideas.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.789
We're just going to, like,
stop people on the street.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.225
And these are
really great characters.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.879
These are, like,
the bedrock of society,

04:30.922 --> 04:32.315
hardworking entrepreneurs.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.839
Man: Security is coming.
We just saw security.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.667
Security is coming,

04:36.711 --> 04:38.887
so I think we're gonna have to
move on to another location.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.759
But thank you. We're moving
and we're having a good time.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.488
[playing mellow Latin music]

05:18.318 --> 05:22.322
I hope I will make you proud
and--

05:29.938 --> 05:34.812
It's hard.
We all miss you, and

05:34.856 --> 05:37.815
I just on keep hearing
that you are a nice--

05:37.859 --> 05:39.426
you are a nice guy.

05:39.469 --> 05:43.168
And I know you are a nice guy,

05:43.212 --> 05:45.736
and we just want you
with us

05:45.780 --> 05:49.131
and we miss you a lot.

05:49.174 --> 05:52.177
I love you.
Come back soon.

06:19.596 --> 06:23.252
From here,
where does this show go now?

06:23.295 --> 06:26.995
I mean, it's been-- it's been
some years and some work.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.998
A lot of years, a lot of money,
and admittedly,

06:30.041 --> 06:34.089
we're very low on money
and we're not stopping.

06:34.132 --> 06:37.266
We're going to figure this out,
beg, borrow or steal.

06:37.309 --> 06:40.704
And we may have
to leave the country, um...

06:40.748 --> 06:43.751
to escape predators,
and what better place to go--

06:43.794 --> 06:45.405
Predators or creditors?

06:45.448 --> 06:48.233
Predators and creditors.
Good reference there.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.845
There's a place
that I love to go to

06:50.888 --> 06:53.021
where it'd be tough
to extradite us,

06:53.064 --> 06:56.111
for one, would be Cuba.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.374
So, I mean, you've heard of
great shows like Narcos.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.071
- Yeah.
- We're inspired by that.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.160
And we have our own
Narcos-type guy.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.032
We have a guy, Don Punta.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.861
It's going to be his story.
That's one of our stories,

07:06.904 --> 07:09.037
the rise and fall of Don Punta.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.605
So, that's our show, but also,

07:11.648 --> 07:14.129
we have a reality
outside the show.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.174
And this Don Punta,
who has some of our money,

07:16.218 --> 07:17.828
is filming down there.

07:17.872 --> 07:20.483
We believe he may have
taken the $20 million.

07:20.527 --> 07:23.747
So, we have a mystery within
a mystery, within a mystery.

07:23.791 --> 07:27.142
We're gonna be dealing with one
of our guys who's filming,

07:27.185 --> 07:29.361
the least one you suspect,
the stupidest,

07:29.405 --> 07:31.233
the most ridiculous,

07:31.276 --> 07:34.976
the worst dressed,
and he may be the guy.

07:35.019 --> 07:38.153
Well, regardless,
when you come back from Cuba,

07:38.196 --> 07:40.068
if you come back alive,
let's get down--

07:40.111 --> 07:41.939
sit down and you
tell me about it again.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.593
- I'd love to do that.
- All right.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.731
Goran: You have guys like
these other characters,

07:50.774 --> 07:54.082
Mild Ricky and Lars
and all these guys,

07:54.125 --> 07:55.953
and what happened to them all?

07:55.997 --> 07:57.520
I am going in
a different direction.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.871
I was always, you know,
the quiet, prudish,

08:00.915 --> 08:04.484
no-drinking, no-cocaine
type of guy. No hookers.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.224
But I think I'm evolving.

08:06.268 --> 08:09.880
We have the booze and the drugs
and the cocaine and the opioids.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.752
Why the fuck not?

08:11.795 --> 08:14.668
I like to make
a total decadent scene.

08:14.711 --> 08:17.322
You know, making love
with these beautiful hookers

08:17.366 --> 08:19.542
or snorting coke
off of Rinaldo's ass.

08:19.586 --> 08:20.761
That'd be fabulous.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.502
[coughing]

08:22.545 --> 08:24.765
You know what?
Maybe you're brilliant.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.941
- Mitch: I know I'm brilliant.
- Maybe.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.943
So, I'm in this,
you're in this,

08:28.986 --> 08:30.988
Rinaldo's in this.
That's three.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.600
And there's a guy, Malik,
who's Cuban, my understanding.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.732
- Goran: Let's begin...
- Yes.

08:35.775 --> 08:38.605
...with a Pepto-Bismol.
Is there one around here?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.215
Mitch: You're going to be
a star as an actor,

08:40.258 --> 08:41.607
being a director,
being a character.

08:41.650 --> 08:42.957
Goran:
Just need a minute.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.915
Mitch:
We're going to be the new Cuba.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.930
We're coming to the end,

08:59.974 --> 09:03.281
coming to
the end of this journey.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.300
Mitch:
It's really just me.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.825
I have no more friends.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.435
Rick is not to be seen.

09:26.478 --> 09:30.091
I just have Miko.
And I don't know, though.

09:30.134 --> 09:34.399
Miko is a great dog.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.619
And I may not be around.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.882
I may not be around to see Miko.

09:38.926 --> 09:43.191
And Miko deserves
someone better:

09:43.234 --> 09:46.542
someone who, you know,
he could look up to,

09:46.586 --> 09:48.588
who could inspire him.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.880
It may be
the end of my journey,

10:19.923 --> 10:21.577
and you're not even two yet.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.057
Who's going to look after you?

10:23.100 --> 10:27.104
Who's going to be there
on your second birthday?

10:28.628 --> 10:29.803
I do have an idea.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.849
I think you'll like my choice.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.986
â™ª Ice weighs heavy
on my wings tonight â™ª

10:39.029 --> 10:43.686
Miko, you've been
a great dog and a good friend,

10:43.730 --> 10:47.734
my only friend.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.084
â™ª And if I could leave

10:50.127 --> 10:53.522
â™ª On a summer breeze

10:53.565 --> 10:58.527
â™ª I would surely leave
this place â™ª

10:58.570 --> 11:02.009
â™ª I would
surely leave this place â™ª

11:05.273 --> 11:08.276
I'll miss you, guy.
I'll miss you, boy.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.849
â™ª All the autumn days
have come and gone â™ª

11:19.896 --> 11:22.899
â™ª Shadows lengthen on the wall

11:24.335 --> 11:26.555
â™ª And a mate with I

11:26.598 --> 11:30.559
â™ª To the sun would fly

11:30.602 --> 11:32.866
â™ª Can no longer hear my call

11:32.909 --> 11:36.913
[engine roaring]

11:58.369 --> 12:08.379
â™ª

12:14.516 --> 12:18.041
These directors coming down
and all this bullshit, man?

12:18.085 --> 12:19.913
I have another thing for them.

12:19.956 --> 12:22.959
[crunching]

12:28.965 --> 12:32.360
This Mitch guy,
I should keep my eye on him.

12:32.403 --> 12:35.755
I have certain doubts.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.366
[no audio]

12:43.023 --> 12:45.286
I like to eat alone now,
but at home,

12:45.329 --> 12:48.463
some nice chick
waiting for us, man.

13:04.348 --> 13:08.962
Hey, chiquita,
can I have a toothpick?

13:09.005 --> 13:11.791
No. Toothpick?

14:17.378 --> 14:19.510
Rinaldo:
I love the chicas here, man.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.774
All the chicks.
The whole environment.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.820
Mmm...

14:30.695 --> 14:32.436
Mitch: Where is this guy?

14:35.875 --> 14:39.052
We just came from the airport.
I got the director. I got Malik.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.315
Like, we're supposed to
have a meeting. We're all ready.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.969
I got it, I got it.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.971
Look.
Everything is taken care of.

14:45.014 --> 14:48.844
Listen. The Spanish way, okay,

14:48.888 --> 14:52.195
is fun and work, fun and work.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.937
You know what I mean?
Now is fun time.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.939
Work time later.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.462
Mitch: All right.
We're going to come down.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.725
Rinaldo: These are
my friends here, man,

15:00.769 --> 15:02.336
and you, actually--
you can come and join me here.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.033
This is so unprofessional.

15:04.077 --> 15:07.167
I was telling
what a great visionary you were,

15:07.210 --> 15:09.256
that you're amazing.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.953
Just come over. Have fun.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.781
We're going to have
a little party later

15:12.824 --> 15:15.305
where there'll be dancing
and all that stuff, whatever.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.960
I guess we're not going to go
through a production meeting.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.876
We're not going to talk about
the script or anything tonight.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.705
Of course, man. We can
always go into the details

15:23.748 --> 15:25.750
later on in my office, right?

15:25.794 --> 15:29.363
You know what?
Like, he may have a point.

15:29.406 --> 15:33.062
Also, it's in the budget.
It's in the budget.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.586
We might as well, you know,
listen to him.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.154
We might as well,
like, shift gears.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.287
Are you convincing me
or yourself?

15:40.330 --> 15:42.245
I'm trying to convince myself.
Am I convincing you?

15:42.289 --> 15:43.725
I don't know. Come on, come on.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.118
I'm just going to go
do some work here.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.902
You're not going to join us?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.338
- I'm not going to join you.
- It's a little downtime.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.600
- That's fine with me.
- Thank you.

15:49.644 --> 15:50.993
You guys do what you got to do.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.777
- Okay.
- All right?

15:52.821 --> 15:54.388
- All right. You can go back.
Malik, are you with me, man?

15:54.431 --> 15:55.998
- Malik: Yeah.
- Mitch: Okay, Malik's with me.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.696
Good. I like that.
You come to an agreement, right?

15:58.740 --> 16:00.176
As you know, Rinaldo,

16:00.220 --> 16:03.440
Don Punta, this is Malik.
He's our host.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.225
He speaks Spanish, but also,

16:05.268 --> 16:07.618
I think he has a great career
as an actor

16:07.662 --> 16:09.707
or as a director.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.100
And I think it's worthwhile,

16:11.144 --> 16:13.189
since we have
these lovely actresses,

16:13.233 --> 16:15.191
that we're going to sort of
show them how--

16:15.235 --> 16:16.540
the auditioning process.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.020
Take advantage of that.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.456
I like that idea.
That's fine with me, man.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.415
You know,
we test the actresses out

16:21.458 --> 16:23.373
to see whether they can
cut the mustard, if you will.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.289
I'm Don Punta, man.
This is my town here. Okay?

16:26.333 --> 16:28.683
I'm taking care
of all of you guys.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.250
- Are you rolling, guys?
- Cameraman: Yep.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.903
Man: All right now.
And action.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.910
[girls cheering]

16:38.954 --> 16:43.045
Rinaldo: All right. All right!
Woo-woo-woo!

16:43.089 --> 16:46.048
[cheering, laughing]

16:46.092 --> 16:47.702
Woman:
It's cold?

16:47.745 --> 16:49.486
Mitch: Do you mind
if I, like, hug or something?

16:49.530 --> 16:52.011
Rinaldo:
Yeah. Give her a kiss.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.883
- Okay, can I kiss you?
- [speaking Spanish]

16:54.926 --> 16:56.145
Okay.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.713
Rinaldo:
Yeah! Let's go.

16:58.756 --> 16:59.975
- Rinaldo: Okay.
- Mitch: Okay?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.672
Rinaldo:
Where's the music now?

17:01.716 --> 17:04.414
Hey. Now, the music?

17:04.458 --> 17:07.983
Hey, Malik, are you my host?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.463
- Mitch: Okay, okay.
- Rinaldo: Come on, man.

17:09.506 --> 17:14.424
Put the music on.

17:14.468 --> 17:19.038
[man singing in Spanish]

17:35.141 --> 17:45.107
â™ª

18:31.022 --> 18:41.032
â™ª

18:43.252 --> 18:48.214
â™ª Ave Maria...

18:57.048 --> 19:01.966
â™ª Gratia plena...

19:03.794 --> 19:05.622
So, how do you
like it here, girls?

19:05.666 --> 19:09.496
You okay?
You like my villa?

19:09.539 --> 19:11.672
You like it?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.891
Let's have a drink, man.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.937
Hey, where's my bitch there?

19:15.980 --> 19:19.810
Come here, Malik.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.725
Who do you think you are?

19:21.769 --> 19:23.336
I don't work for you.
I work for Mitch.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.728
Rinaldo: No, no, no.
You listen to me now. Okay?

19:24.772 --> 19:26.643
I have these
two beautiful girls here.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.515
You're not going
to ruin this, okay?

19:28.558 --> 19:33.172
So, get me some drinks for them.
You want a drink, right? Okay.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.521
I can't drink alone,
anyway, so...

19:34.564 --> 19:35.957
Listen, guys...

19:36.000 --> 19:37.698
Rinaldo:
You're ruining my project here.

19:37.741 --> 19:38.960
You got these broads all
over you. You rented the villa.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.744
I understand that.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.486
We've got some really big
structural problems with this.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.097
I know you... you believe
you're Don Punta...

19:46.141 --> 19:47.229
Of course.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.362
...in real life.

19:49.405 --> 19:52.539
But listen, man.
I need some backstory here, bro,

19:52.582 --> 19:54.410
'cause I'm not fucking sold
on this.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.630
Rinaldo:
I'm putting the money here.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.415
This project have to go on.
I'm relying on you, all right?

19:59.459 --> 20:02.026
Let's rename this Don Punta.

20:02.070 --> 20:05.247
Forget the Punta Brothers 'cause
no one wants to be your brother.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.337
You know? So, are we going to
change the title at least?

20:08.381 --> 20:09.469
Can we agree on that?

20:09.512 --> 20:11.035
â™ª I like it like that

20:11.079 --> 20:13.560
You know that song?
I love it, man.

20:13.603 --> 20:16.563
Listen. I'm going to
teach you something, okay?

20:16.606 --> 20:19.522
These are little step-by-step.

20:19.566 --> 20:22.873
I'm going to give a break
to these beautiful girls.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.527
They're going to freshen up
for me.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.095
Look at this toe.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.967
See? Gentle, nice.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.275
Look at the other one.
Look at this. See?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.799
One day, you're going to
get there, like me, man.

20:35.843 --> 20:39.020
Look at that.

20:39.063 --> 20:42.241
Just get the-- you know,
the tap, a bubble bath.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.766
In the meantime,
you can go ahead, okay?

20:55.166 --> 20:58.082
Malik:
Don Punta, here's Mitch.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.345
Rinaldo!

20:59.388 --> 21:00.607
Rinaldo:
Hey, Mitch.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.391
How are you, man?

21:02.435 --> 21:04.437
Rinaldo, my friend...

21:04.480 --> 21:05.916
Yeah? Speak up, man.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.222
Speak up?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.006
Yeah. What's your concern?

21:09.050 --> 21:12.401
My concern.
Remember I gave you $250,000?

21:12.445 --> 21:14.185
You came to me, to my office.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.013
You said you're an actor

21:16.057 --> 21:19.887
and you had a dream to do
a film called Punta Brothers.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.454
- Right.
- And...

21:21.497 --> 21:22.716
Yeah, and?

21:22.759 --> 21:24.500
It seems to be in trouble.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.197
What's going on?
Tell me what happened to--

21:26.241 --> 21:28.374
Trouble? See, that word
"trouble," I don't like it, man.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.899
"Trouble,"
it's out of my vocabulary.

21:31.942 --> 21:35.294
Malik come fresh. This guy...

21:35.337 --> 21:36.991
Mitch:
Malik come fresh?

21:37.034 --> 21:40.081
Malik is, uh-- he's my host.
He has no acting ability.

21:40.124 --> 21:43.911
Hey, I already talked to him.
He's taking care of it.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.216
What are you doing? Like...

21:45.260 --> 21:46.827
You fucked my wife.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.219
What does that have
to do with anything?

21:48.263 --> 21:49.699
Hey, you know what?

21:49.743 --> 21:51.310
- You owe me.
- Why do I owe you?

21:51.353 --> 21:53.355
Remember, you came to me, idiot.

21:53.399 --> 21:56.576
You came to me, said,
"I need you to help out my wife.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.360
She has a problem
with the immigration."

21:58.404 --> 22:00.536
I said I'll help her out,
and in order to help her out,

22:00.580 --> 22:02.233
she had to become my fake wife.

22:02.277 --> 22:05.062
I just experienced
a come-to-Jesus moment.

22:05.106 --> 22:08.718
So, what are you blaming me for?
I loved her.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.372
You didn't love her.
I wanted her,

22:10.416 --> 22:12.809
and she ended up sleeping
with everybody else.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.289
You owe me, man!

22:14.333 --> 22:15.377
No. You owe me, man.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.770
You owe me.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.990
Mitch:
I want to take down Rinaldo

22:20.034 --> 22:22.602
and I want to walk off
into the sunset.

22:46.626 --> 22:49.455
Rinaldo, you look
a little hung over there, man.

22:49.498 --> 22:52.022
Oh, yeah. You know, things.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.373
Uh, I gave him $250,000.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.332
He promised me a screenplay.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.551
It was called
the Punta Brothers.

22:58.594 --> 22:59.987
You're not well?

23:00.030 --> 23:01.597
If you're not well,
we'll get you a doctor.

23:01.641 --> 23:04.078
I have no idea what's going on.
I mean, what happened?

23:04.121 --> 23:06.385
It's a stomach flu? Is it
intestinal flu? What's going on?

23:06.428 --> 23:07.777
Rinaldo:
Your man's still alive,

23:07.821 --> 23:09.213
so that's what matters, right?

23:09.257 --> 23:12.434
Rinaldo, we have
a large investment in you.

23:12.478 --> 23:15.263
Maybe there's a novel
out of this.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.569
Maybe if it's a great
screenplay,

23:16.612 --> 23:17.961
we could novelize it.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.050
They don't have
cocaine here in Cuba, man.

23:20.094 --> 23:21.704
It's not a big thing here.

23:21.748 --> 23:24.054
A screenplay leads to a novel,
maybe leads to a play.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.447
Maybe do a Broadway play.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.362
There's all kinds
of possibilities.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.581
Or maybe a TV series.

23:28.624 --> 23:31.105
Goran, Rinaldo? Let's sit down.

23:31.148 --> 23:33.063
Goran:
He's got some kind of script

23:33.107 --> 23:35.239
that I have to shoot.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.328
He's never written
anything before,

23:37.372 --> 23:41.855
so that's really
a confidence-builder.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.900
He's a great director,
but he used to be an actor.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.162
Now, he's a director.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.686
So he'll be both
a director and an actor.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.339
It's like a combo.

23:48.383 --> 23:49.732
Mitch: So, Goran should be
an interesting guy.

23:49.776 --> 23:51.168
I've heard
some wonderful things about him.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.388
He was a big star
in the '70s and '80s,

23:53.432 --> 23:55.129
an action figure.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.697
- So, the guy is good, eh?
- Mitch: He's really good.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.134
Played with a lot of
the major players in Hollywood,

24:00.177 --> 24:03.572
and now, he's transformed
himself into a director.

24:03.616 --> 24:06.488
Let me look at this guy, man.
He's kind of...

24:06.532 --> 24:09.970
The eye is
the window to the souls.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.885
Goran: With this production,
it's always the same thing.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.756
I get there. It's a nightmare.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.846
Yeah. I can see
some potential in this guy.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.195
I like him.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.458
Goran: You know, no one listens.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.025
That's not how you direct, man.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.071
Gracias, seÃ±ora.

24:25.420 --> 24:28.162
Nice box. Hey.

24:28.205 --> 24:30.033
Okay, amigos.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.905
We going to celebrate
the new chapter

24:31.948 --> 24:33.167
in the Punta Brothers.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.690
- Salud.
- Salud.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.387
- Goran: Salud, guys.
- Salud. Salud.

24:36.431 --> 24:39.086
They think I'm stupid,
but I know what I'm doing here.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.094
Rinaldo: I'm still in
a hangover type of thing.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.836
You know,
that wasn't really me.

24:49.879 --> 24:52.360
I'm serious about this project.

24:52.403 --> 24:53.579
Mitch: Rinaldo has a passion
for what he's doing,

24:53.622 --> 24:54.928
but if it doesn't work out,

24:54.971 --> 24:56.843
then maybe
I'll do my own screenplay.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.975
Maybe I'll
take over the acting,

24:59.019 --> 25:00.716
because I really love
the acting.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.153
Goran: It's going to take me
hours to get to location.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.415
I don't know where they are,

25:04.459 --> 25:07.549
and I'm in no hurry,
like I told you.

25:07.593 --> 25:11.118
And I'm dreading it, frankly.
These people are out of control.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.424
The last couple of times

25:13.468 --> 25:16.993
I tried to direct
with these people,

25:17.037 --> 25:18.560
it was a nightmare.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.954
I almost changed profession.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.914
You know, this is
always a mystery to me.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.148
Mitch: I went by
the villa, and no one's there.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.411
Can't get in.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.935
So, I thought I'd just go to
a local cafeteria,

25:45.979 --> 25:48.416
N + A Cafeteria
around the corner,

25:48.459 --> 25:51.854
just to get in
Cuban sort of culture.

25:51.898 --> 25:54.117
And again, it's a great
opportunity to write,

25:54.161 --> 25:56.119
and I'm excited.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.558
Goran: You know, these
guys are a little better

25:59.601 --> 26:00.776
than the last batch.

26:00.820 --> 26:04.432
Rinaldo, he's a natural.

26:04.475 --> 26:07.478
If I had a restaurant,
he'd be working in my kitchen.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.178
Rinaldo:
Don Punta is my idea, man.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.007
If nobody agree with that,
fuck it.

26:14.050 --> 26:17.967
If they don't like the script,
I rip the whole thing.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.491
I use it for toilet paper.
So what?

26:20.535 --> 26:22.972
Fuck.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.977
Mitch:
This reminds me of Hemingway,

26:28.021 --> 26:29.283
his classic book
I read in high school,

26:29.326 --> 26:30.763
Old Man and the Sea.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.417
No jokes here, guys.
I still feel young.

26:33.461 --> 26:36.116
Wow.

26:49.912 --> 26:53.089
Goran: If you look at
the sequence of events,

26:53.133 --> 26:56.832
I show up
for a production meeting,

26:56.876 --> 26:58.181
and this guy's got

26:58.225 --> 27:00.793
women all over the place,
dancing.

27:00.836 --> 27:05.014
And I'm fully expecting
maybe a staff meeting.

27:05.058 --> 27:07.669
Instead, I've got these
beautiful women dancing around.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.890
I mean,
it was really bizarre.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.327
You know, I was assured
maybe this time it'll work.

27:13.370 --> 27:14.720
It'll be more professional.

27:16.112 --> 27:18.419
Mitch? He's something else, too.

27:18.462 --> 27:22.553
I mean, he's supposed
to be, like, an executive.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.686
He was very serious,
but soon as he saw the girls,

27:24.730 --> 27:27.036
he totally abandoned me.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.779
He's originally
a hotshot lawyer,

27:30.823 --> 27:32.825
and he's right in there
in the thick of things,

27:32.868 --> 27:34.391
dancing like--

27:34.435 --> 27:36.611
He's a pretty good dancer,
actually.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.091
It's unbelievable.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.745
I've never seen anything
like it, but you know,

27:39.788 --> 27:42.443
now, I can say I've
seen everything in production.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.622
I'm going to say, yeah,
that guy Don Punta,

27:47.666 --> 27:50.843
he's a real loose cannon,
this guy.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.366
You know, he's out of control.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.107
You don't know what
he's going to do next.

27:54.150 --> 27:57.588
This guy's swallowing cocaine,
just completely oblivious

27:57.632 --> 28:01.027
to what we're supposed
to be doing, you know?

28:01.070 --> 28:04.987
And I even went so far as
to block the script

28:05.031 --> 28:07.511
while they were partying.
I went through it.

28:07.555 --> 28:11.341
I came up with new ideas,
and it was all for nothing.

28:13.082 --> 28:16.869
I came on to this production
thinking that, uh,

28:16.912 --> 28:19.175
maybe I was going to do
something unique.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.568
It was a reality show.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.788
I guess that's the nature

28:22.831 --> 28:24.659
of this specific production,
anyway.

28:25.660 --> 28:26.922
Thinking about production,

28:26.966 --> 28:31.361
I can sort of compare it

28:31.405 --> 28:35.539
to Orson Welles's last project.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.063
You know, that psychedelic
thing he did,

28:37.106 --> 28:38.368
The Other Side of the Wind.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.153
That's what it reminds me of.

28:40.196 --> 28:44.287
Same type of chaos

28:44.331 --> 28:47.247
and smorgasbord
of actors and characters.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.989
You know, I mean, you get
an idea of what it was like

28:50.032 --> 28:51.991
being in that production.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.558
But you got to
give this guy credit.

28:54.602 --> 28:57.779
This is some interesting stuff,
interesting characters.

29:02.044 --> 29:05.613
Nothing can surprise me
after this.

29:16.885 --> 29:19.453
These Mickey Mouse actor,

29:19.496 --> 29:22.717
let's see who they are,
who they really are.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.284
How are you this morning?

29:24.327 --> 29:25.589
Well, we're having
a little controversy here.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.243
Long night?

29:27.287 --> 29:29.550
You're a little late
for this meeting, aren't you?

29:29.593 --> 29:32.466
I have an idea why you're late.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.860
Yeah? Well, I was working on
the script all night.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.122
Really? A script?

29:36.165 --> 29:37.993
No shit.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.865
You're going to really like
this. I think you guys--

29:39.908 --> 29:42.345
Rinaldo: Well, I know exactly
what you were doing last night,

29:42.389 --> 29:45.653
down here and everything.

29:45.696 --> 29:48.308
Maricon told me.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.962
- I'm the maricon who told him.
- Goran: Are you the maricon?

29:50.005 --> 29:51.659
I hate that name.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.617
I'd rather have Meyer, frankly.
But whatever. Go ahead.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.184
Meyer? Like Meyer Lansky?

29:55.228 --> 29:56.838
Mitch: Meyer Lansky.
I think that's very Spanish.

29:56.882 --> 30:00.624
You know, Mitch told me
how loyal you are to me, man.

30:00.668 --> 30:03.149
You were sleeping with my girl.

30:03.192 --> 30:07.196
So the two girls that were here,
they weren't with you?

30:07.240 --> 30:09.720
Oh, you're pretending not
to know anything about it, eh?

30:09.764 --> 30:12.985
Listen, uh, Don Punta,

30:13.028 --> 30:14.377
I'm really trying my hardest

30:14.421 --> 30:16.031
to stay on board
this production.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.512
I mean, first of all,
the script is horrifying.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.296
Rinaldo: If you only knew
what happened in Miami,

30:20.340 --> 30:22.733
you wouldn't be acting
like these guys, you know?

30:22.777 --> 30:24.300
I got rid of
a couple guys there,

30:24.344 --> 30:26.389
Just like this, all right?
[snapping fingers]

30:26.433 --> 30:29.740
So please, stay with me.
Be loyal to me.

30:29.784 --> 30:32.482
You treat me good,
I treat you better.

30:32.526 --> 30:36.399
I'm going to hire you the
best bitches here for you, man.

30:36.443 --> 30:39.663
You can choose.
And the maricon for you, okay?

30:39.707 --> 30:41.230
Not okay. It's all right.

30:41.274 --> 30:44.494
Rinaldo: So you all going
to be happy, all right?

30:44.538 --> 30:46.540
Is that okay? Clear? All good?

30:46.583 --> 30:47.846
- Okay.
- I like that.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.863
I actually ran into him
at the Nacional.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.865
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.170
He's at the Nacional?

31:08.214 --> 31:09.432
Well, he was telling me
the place

31:09.476 --> 31:10.999
was a fucking piece-of-shit hole

31:11.043 --> 31:12.696
and he wanted to
get the hell out.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.220
That sounds like Rick.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.613
- It does sound like Rick.
- Wow.

31:16.657 --> 31:20.966
Well, this is my shirt.
This is great.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.272
Okay.
This is a Croatian shirt,

31:23.316 --> 31:24.926
my favourite Croatian shirt.
Okay.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.450
I'm going to try to find him.
He's at this Nacional.

31:27.494 --> 31:32.020
And wouldn't it be wonderful
that I reunite with Rick

31:32.064 --> 31:35.241
and the two of us
will ride off into the sunset

31:35.284 --> 31:39.723
underneath this
great tunnel here in Cuba?

31:56.740 --> 32:01.006
[man singing in Spanish]

32:06.663 --> 32:10.929
The next thing you know,
he's doing all this blow and...

32:15.324 --> 32:17.326
[inhaling]

32:20.373 --> 32:22.375
Oh, fuck.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.815
[inhaling]

32:27.858 --> 32:30.687
Oh, man. [groaning]

32:30.731 --> 32:33.212
I just wanted to,
you know, call you outside.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.083
I want you to keep an eye
on those guys, all right?

32:35.127 --> 32:36.780
I will. I will.
Let's see how they do.

32:36.824 --> 32:39.827
Let's see how this
progresses in preproduction.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.394
- Ah.
- Here you go, buddy.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.396
You read my mind, man.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.354
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Jeez, man.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.008
- It's painful to watch.
- Thank you, man.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.792
I'm starting to sweat
watching you.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.142
A lot of residue here, man.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.708
A lot of shit
is still sticking there.

32:51.752 --> 32:54.581
You know what I mean, eh?

32:54.624 --> 32:56.713
Probably is getting back
in my-- all the way here.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.541
[sniffing]

32:58.585 --> 33:00.413
Can you see any shit here?
No. Really? No?

33:00.456 --> 33:01.675
Goran: There's a little bit
of shit there, yeah.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.764
Really? No. That's maybe...

33:03.807 --> 33:06.375
[blowing nose]

33:06.419 --> 33:10.292
Never seen that, ever,
in any production.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.033
So, I mean, it's the first.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.817
A lot of things
are a first here.

33:13.861 --> 33:17.865
That's nothing, man. I've got
unlimited, you know, supply.

33:17.908 --> 33:20.955
So, you know,
we're all good here.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.045
By the way, Goran,
you have to loosen up, man.

33:24.089 --> 33:27.309
I never see you dance, you know,
participate in the fun here.

33:27.353 --> 33:29.007
I want you to be part
of that fun, too.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.747
You can be too serious.

33:30.791 --> 33:35.100
Hey. Balance, man. Balance.
Fun is part of the business.

33:35.143 --> 33:38.059
And at the end,
I'm going to treat you, man.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.669
I'm going to treat you well,
all right?

33:39.713 --> 33:40.975
Goran: I'd like to see
how we get to that point.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.498
- Okay.
- Goran: But I appreciate it.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.152
- Beautiful, man.
- Goran: Thanks, brother.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.414
I'm counting on you, all right?

33:45.458 --> 33:46.676
- Yeah.
- Rinaldo: I really are.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.156
- Okay.
- Rinaldo: Bye.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.203
[inhaling]

33:53.466 --> 33:57.470
[man singing in Spanish]

34:24.149 --> 34:26.107
Mitch:
This is really strange.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.388
Rick? It can't be Rick. No.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.920
Rick? No. No.
Why aren't you answering me?

34:56.964 --> 34:58.966
Rick. It's not Rick.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.702
[flamenco guitar playing]

35:39.746 --> 35:49.756
â™ª

37:01.044 --> 37:11.054
â™ª

37:51.878 --> 37:55.229
Goran: Don Punta, we haven't
even started shooting.

37:55.273 --> 38:00.147
I mean, you're really mocking
that stuff up pretty much.

38:01.888 --> 38:04.238
- You okay?
- I'm perfectly fine.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.761
- Okay.
- Trust me.

38:05.805 --> 38:07.720
Where are these guys, man?

38:07.763 --> 38:09.374
Supposed to be here
for this meeting.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.419
Guys? Hey.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.989
There you are.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.599
Goran:
We thought of this logically.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.732
Like, if we looked at it--

38:19.775 --> 38:21.342
Rinaldo:
Hold on. Hold on.

38:21.386 --> 38:22.822
One thing at a time, all right?

38:22.865 --> 38:25.346
Would you like some stuff
right here?

38:25.390 --> 38:27.087
No, no, no. No, thank you.

38:27.130 --> 38:30.525
So, you-- Should I--
Do you want me to continue here?

38:30.569 --> 38:31.787
Go on, man.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.399
Goran:
All right.

38:34.442 --> 38:36.226
So, I figure
this exterior scene here,

38:36.270 --> 38:37.706
this is my main concern.

38:37.750 --> 38:41.101
Rinaldo: Where is
my fucking cigar, man?

38:45.366 --> 38:47.890
See? No cut it. But it's fine.

38:47.934 --> 38:49.631
We can survive.

38:49.675 --> 38:52.112
Goran: Okay. So, look.

38:52.155 --> 38:53.853
- Yeah. You were saying?
- Yeah.

38:53.896 --> 38:55.333
Rinaldo:
But wait a minute.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.335
I need a blast, man.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.034
[exhaling]

39:01.077 --> 39:04.690
Goran: So, we do
have five exteriors here,

39:04.733 --> 39:06.431
and I don't know if, uh...

39:07.693 --> 39:08.911
[coughing]

39:08.955 --> 39:10.957
...if, uh... Ugh.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.090
Rinaldo:
This is so good, man.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.657
- This is magic.
- Yeah.

39:15.701 --> 39:18.051
You should get
some of this shit, man.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.661
Yeah. I just got some
on my pants. Listen.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.315
Rinaldo:
This is like a blessing, man.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.882
Goran:
We got a clear three-act--

39:22.925 --> 39:24.274
Give me the script.
Give me the script. Come on.

39:24.318 --> 39:25.841
- Give me that shit.
- Are you--

39:25.885 --> 39:27.539
Rinaldo:
Come on. Come on. Come on.

39:27.582 --> 39:30.019
Goran:
There you go. There's your--

39:30.063 --> 39:31.891
Rinaldo:
Fuck. This--

39:31.934 --> 39:34.372
- Goran: Rinaldo!
- This is garbage, man.

39:34.415 --> 39:38.071
It's no good anymore.
Your funny shit is garbage.

39:38.114 --> 39:41.944
It all change.
Change of course, plan.

39:41.988 --> 39:44.991
Everything is--
You know, start from scratch.

39:45.034 --> 39:48.690
[inhaling]

39:49.996 --> 39:51.954
Oh, fuck, man.

39:51.998 --> 39:56.524
My friend, maybe you'd better
go easy on the, uh, cocaine.

39:56.568 --> 39:57.786
There's something--
You're bleeding.

39:57.830 --> 39:58.961
What are you talking about, man?

39:59.005 --> 40:00.136
Goran:
You got blood all over.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.268
What are you talking about?

40:01.311 --> 40:02.704
Take a look, man. You got blood.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.533
Whoa.

40:05.577 --> 40:09.668
Rinaldo: Now, let me just
do some more shit here, man.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.974
I really like the shit.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.716
[inhaling]

40:17.502 --> 40:21.114
- Fuck, man.
- Goran: Hey.

40:21.157 --> 40:23.377
Okay, guys. I think it's time

40:23.421 --> 40:25.597
for me to go and
take a dump, man.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.207
And then I come back.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.817
Where are you going?

40:28.861 --> 40:31.472
- Rinaldo: To take a dump, man.
- Oh.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.126
Rinaldo: You want to come
and clean my ass later on?

40:33.169 --> 40:34.432
I call you, all right?

40:47.880 --> 40:57.890
â™ª

41:06.072 --> 41:16.082
â™ª

41:54.642 --> 42:04.652
â™ª

43:10.675 --> 43:12.851
Rinaldo:
I have to call you, guy.

43:12.894 --> 43:15.114
It's going down, man.

43:17.856 --> 43:19.161
Hey, Doug.

43:19.205 --> 43:22.512
Doug, listen.
Yeah, yeah, it's me.

43:22.556 --> 43:26.691
And this character
called Rinaldo,

43:26.734 --> 43:28.997
who I thought was one of us
and was honest and everything,

43:29.041 --> 43:31.434
he screwed me.

43:31.478 --> 43:34.394
Everything is over, man.
It's over.

43:34.437 --> 43:37.876
What do I mean?
[laughing]

43:37.919 --> 43:39.573
It's over, man.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.575
No, no, no.
Don't put me in that.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.708
Like, now, I'm accused
of, like, taking all the money.

43:43.751 --> 43:46.841
Rinaldo:
Final day is here.

43:46.885 --> 43:49.365
So you should return the money.

43:49.409 --> 43:52.673
Do everything that is,
you know, good.

43:52.717 --> 43:54.849
So, we have to talk about this,

43:54.893 --> 43:57.112
because I spoke
to you about a week ago.

43:57.156 --> 43:59.375
Rinaldo:
I'm cleaning my conscience,

43:59.419 --> 44:00.768
and take care of it.

44:00.812 --> 44:02.727
Do the right thing,
at least for once.

44:02.770 --> 44:05.730
Okay? That's all I can say now.

44:05.773 --> 44:09.516
And I trusted him,
and he stabbed me in the back.

44:09.559 --> 44:11.823
And everybody thought
that he was such a nice guy,

44:11.866 --> 44:13.215
but I guess right now,

44:13.259 --> 44:15.565
we know that
he's not such a nice guy.

44:15.609 --> 44:20.092
So you won't hear from me
anymore, okay?

44:20.135 --> 44:23.138
Blanquita is better for me...
[laughing]

44:23.182 --> 44:25.140
...if you know what I mean,
right?

44:25.184 --> 44:28.404
I'll be seeing you
somewhere up there, man.

44:28.448 --> 44:32.234
You have your days counted
as well, so face it, man.

44:32.278 --> 44:34.846
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

44:34.889 --> 44:37.805
Hasta la vista, bitch.

44:37.849 --> 44:39.851
Fuck you.

44:39.894 --> 44:43.942
Hey? He hung up.

44:43.985 --> 44:46.205
You know? What the fuck?

44:46.248 --> 44:48.250
Fuck, man.

44:50.644 --> 44:52.211
[gasping]

44:53.865 --> 44:57.172
And there was a lot of death
in this show.

44:57.216 --> 44:59.914
I'm lucky that I'm still
sitting here, that I'm not dead.

44:59.958 --> 45:02.395
Goran, Goran!

45:02.438 --> 45:05.572
Hey, Mitch.
Where are you guys?

45:05.615 --> 45:09.228
Mitch... Man, man.

45:09.271 --> 45:12.231
Anybody around?
Where is everybody, man?

45:12.274 --> 45:14.407
Where is everybody? Fuck.

45:14.450 --> 45:16.583
My final message
to you, Rinaldo?

45:16.626 --> 45:19.325
We've got a fix
on your cellphone,

45:19.368 --> 45:21.370
so I know where you are.

45:21.414 --> 45:24.634
I know that compound
where you are.

45:24.678 --> 45:26.419
Because I'm coming,

45:26.462 --> 45:29.161
and it's going to be like
George Bush and shock and awe.

45:29.204 --> 45:30.684
We're coming down.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.252
We're going to get you,
and there's no escape.

45:33.295 --> 45:38.257
Where is the fucking
everybody, man?

45:38.300 --> 45:40.868
Where is everybody?

45:40.912 --> 45:43.349
And I don't care if you're Don,
Rinaldo, Punta, or Escobar.

45:43.392 --> 45:45.525
All four of you,
we're going to get you.

45:45.568 --> 45:48.571
[moaning]

45:48.615 --> 45:51.009
Not even a fucking bitch
around, man.

46:09.810 --> 46:19.777
â™ª

46:27.088 --> 46:37.098
â™ª

47:39.944 --> 47:49.910
â™ª

48:28.296 --> 48:30.298
[coughing]

48:34.999 --> 48:37.088
Fuck, man.

48:37.131 --> 48:38.872
Fuck, man!

48:38.916 --> 48:41.048
[shouting incoherently]

48:41.092 --> 48:43.572
â™ª So fine and so gentle

48:46.010 --> 48:49.578
â™ª I came around

48:49.622 --> 48:53.147
â™ª And now I see

48:53.191 --> 48:55.758
â™ª Your face

48:55.802 --> 48:58.936
â™ª So sentimentally

49:02.678 --> 49:04.071
What, are you guys filming this?
What the--

49:04.115 --> 49:06.160
Hey, dude. You okay?

49:08.684 --> 49:10.164
What are you guys doing?
Let's go.

49:10.208 --> 49:12.210
Call 911.

49:12.253 --> 49:15.126
Jesus Christ, man.
Get the fucking ambulance.

49:15.169 --> 49:17.911
What are you guys doing?

49:17.955 --> 49:21.262
â™ª Angels call your name

49:21.306 --> 49:24.787
â™ª They do sing to me

49:26.615 --> 49:28.748
He's done, man. He's gone.

49:28.791 --> 49:30.924
Give him mouth-to-mouth, Mitch.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.360
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious, man.

49:32.404 --> 49:33.666
Why you think I called you?

49:40.803 --> 49:43.502
Mitch: There's no pulse.
This was not supposed to happen.

49:43.545 --> 49:46.287
Goran: No. He must have took
just one big hit and went down.

49:46.331 --> 49:47.636
Mitch: We have to
make funeral arrangements.

49:47.680 --> 49:51.423
We have to call
his relatives or--

49:51.466 --> 49:54.165
You better get that coke off
your nose before the cops come.

49:54.208 --> 49:55.688
- I appreciate it.
- Get cleaned up.

49:55.731 --> 49:57.342
Well, I was trying
to help him out.

49:57.385 --> 49:59.518
Let's get Malik. Stand vigil
by the body, will you?

49:59.561 --> 50:00.780
Where is he?

50:00.823 --> 50:03.043
We need someone
to stand vigil here.

50:03.087 --> 50:07.569
Oh, I...I kind of...

50:07.613 --> 50:09.310
You know, I've been
through a lot with Rinaldo.

50:09.354 --> 50:11.399
I knew him
when he was just a doorman

50:11.443 --> 50:16.361
and then an aspiring filmmaker
and aspiring drug lord.

50:16.404 --> 50:18.972
And now, he's gone,

50:19.016 --> 50:21.714
and I think he'll be missed.

50:21.757 --> 50:24.369
But he'll be remembered.

50:24.412 --> 50:27.111
I'm not sure exactly for what,
but he will be remembered.

50:27.154 --> 50:29.243
â™ª To me and now

50:32.246 --> 50:35.206
â™ª I feel so thankfully

50:35.249 --> 50:37.686
â™ª That you have been
so good to me â™ª

50:37.730 --> 50:39.210
Mitch: I don't drink,
and I don't smoke.

50:39.253 --> 50:43.170
But I'm, you know,
shaking a little bit here. Okay.

50:43.214 --> 50:45.085
Well, guess what?
You're going to fucking drink,

50:45.129 --> 50:46.913
and you're going to smoke.

50:46.956 --> 50:49.046
Okay? You're at my table,
and you can't just sit there...

50:49.089 --> 50:50.786
- This is your table?
- ...like a dick, looking at me.

50:50.830 --> 50:52.614
Okay. But Wally--

50:52.658 --> 50:55.313
You got to drink some poison.
I don't want to drink this shit,

50:55.356 --> 50:56.618
but for you, it's okay.

50:56.662 --> 50:58.229
Okay.

50:58.272 --> 51:00.709
- L'chaim, my friend.
- Wally: Salud, boys.

51:00.753 --> 51:01.971
Mitch:
Oh, this is horrible.

51:02.015 --> 51:03.843
It is poison. Okay.

51:03.886 --> 51:06.019
- I don't smoke.
- Neither do I.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.760
- Okay.
- But it's this production.

51:07.803 --> 51:09.240
Okay. Here goes.

51:09.283 --> 51:11.590
You got to put it
in your mouth to light it.

51:11.633 --> 51:13.635
You can't fucking
just put the cigarette out.

51:18.205 --> 51:19.859
Hey, it's not bad.

51:19.902 --> 51:21.252
First time for everything.

51:21.295 --> 51:22.557
Mitch: There's a first time
for everything.

51:37.442 --> 51:40.184
Mitch: Malik,
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

51:40.227 --> 51:41.794
You know,
I was hoping you'd be an actor

51:41.837 --> 51:44.101
and, you know,
a major star in this project.

51:44.144 --> 51:47.147
But you know, it was out of
my control. I'm sorry.

51:47.191 --> 51:50.933
Okay. It just sucks that
it has to go down like this.

51:50.977 --> 51:52.805
I don't know
if he was really aware

51:52.848 --> 51:54.633
of his function in this film.

51:54.676 --> 51:56.504
He was the host.

51:56.548 --> 51:59.159
I don't know what that means.

51:59.203 --> 52:02.119
I'm sorry you didn't
get to meet Rick.

52:02.162 --> 52:04.295
Unfortunately.
His story is very inspiring.

52:04.338 --> 52:05.731
Mitch:
It is.

52:05.774 --> 52:06.993
I heard he's the type of guy

52:07.036 --> 52:08.821
that'll give you
the shirt off his back.

52:08.864 --> 52:12.868
Oh. Well, actually,
he actually did.

52:21.877 --> 52:23.444
Okay. Let me now address

52:23.488 --> 52:24.837
what's happened
the last three or four days.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.795
I was at this villa,

52:26.839 --> 52:28.493
and a lot of strange
things were happening.

52:28.536 --> 52:29.842
And I'm now, again,
piecing together.

52:29.885 --> 52:32.149
I mean, it's all coming at me,

52:32.192 --> 52:34.673
so stick with me.

52:42.333 --> 52:44.900
So, you thought
this Rick didn't exist.

52:44.944 --> 52:46.206
Goran:
Well, you know what?

52:46.250 --> 52:47.642
When I see it, I'll believe it.

52:47.686 --> 52:49.383
I mean, it's like I said.

52:49.427 --> 52:52.125
It's unlike anything
I've ever worked on.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.344
Mitch: Well, he is--
What's the expression?

52:53.387 --> 52:54.432
I'm not sure, but to paraphrase,

52:54.475 --> 52:56.782
he's, like, inscrutable.

52:56.825 --> 53:00.220
He's a riddle wrapped in a
mystery wrapped in a conundrum.

53:00.264 --> 53:01.961
Well, look.

53:02.004 --> 53:03.832
I mean, bottom line is,
we've been had.

53:03.876 --> 53:05.660
He's been pulling
the strings all along,

53:05.704 --> 53:08.228
and this is what
I find fascinating.

53:08.272 --> 53:09.751
You're telling me it was him

53:09.795 --> 53:11.449
who pulled the strings
for us to get here?

53:11.492 --> 53:13.712
It was.

53:13.755 --> 53:15.453
Goran: We're here in Cuba.
It wasn't you who--

53:15.496 --> 53:16.715
It wasn't me. No.

53:16.758 --> 53:18.804
He even pulled one over you.

53:18.847 --> 53:20.936
I'm sure he's pulled
more than one over me,

53:20.980 --> 53:22.242
but I believe in him,

53:22.286 --> 53:24.723
because he is a guy
with a vision.

53:24.766 --> 53:26.246
He's passionate,

53:26.290 --> 53:28.857
and whatever
he puts his mind to happens.

53:28.901 --> 53:30.946
And this is happening.

53:30.990 --> 53:34.123
What is it?
Rinaldo and Mitch--

53:34.167 --> 53:36.604
- Okay.
- Producer: Yeah.

53:36.648 --> 53:38.258
- One or two seconds.
- Goran: Yeah, you got it.

53:38.302 --> 53:40.260
Mitch: Yeah.
Okay. Let's go.

53:40.304 --> 53:41.783
Goran: I don't even believe
he's here, if he exists, man.

53:41.827 --> 53:43.220
He does exist. Okay.

53:43.263 --> 53:44.264
You guys are getting on my
nerves, man.

53:44.308 --> 53:45.483
What's up with this?

53:45.526 --> 53:46.919
He was supposed to
get us a permit.

53:46.962 --> 53:48.050
You know,
this is a very popular hotel.

53:48.094 --> 53:49.269
You bring me out
all the way here

53:49.313 --> 53:50.531
and you tell me
we're about to meet him.

53:50.575 --> 53:52.011
and they kick us out of there.

53:52.054 --> 53:53.882
Why? Because
there's some cameras with us?

53:53.926 --> 53:55.406
Let's get us a mojito. I'm sorry
to waste your time, my friend.

53:55.449 --> 53:57.321
- Let's get a mojito, man.
- Okay.

53:57.364 --> 53:59.061
This is getting
slightly painful.

53:59.105 --> 54:00.454
- Mitch: All right.
- Goran: Let's go.

54:07.461 --> 54:10.334
Mitch:
And wouldn't it be wonderful

54:10.377 --> 54:15.252
if I reunite with Rick
here in Cuba,

54:15.295 --> 54:18.646
and the two of us will
ride off into the sunset

54:18.690 --> 54:22.607
underneath this great tunnel?

54:44.368 --> 54:45.847
Goran:
Let me ask you something.

54:45.891 --> 54:47.327
Mitch:
Go ahead.

54:47.371 --> 54:50.287
Goran: This individual Rick,
that we're...

54:50.330 --> 54:53.855
- Yes.
- ...about to meet...

54:53.899 --> 54:55.292
What do you want to know
about him?

54:55.335 --> 54:57.859
Well, what I want to know is--

54:57.903 --> 54:59.165
I heard that he's difficult.

54:59.208 --> 55:01.210
Mitch:
Well, I disagree.

55:01.254 --> 55:02.647
I've known him for many years.

55:02.690 --> 55:07.173
He's a warm, compassionate guy,
really smart.

55:07.216 --> 55:09.349
He gets stuff done.

55:09.393 --> 55:11.438
Whatever it takes, he gets it
done.

55:11.482 --> 55:16.095
And he just has
done it his own way.

55:16.138 --> 55:17.488
He just breaks all the rules.

55:17.531 --> 55:18.793
He's like an entrepreneur,
in a sense.

55:18.837 --> 55:19.881
Very entrepreneur.
Like, forget--

55:19.925 --> 55:21.361
Goran:
Revolutionary.

55:21.405 --> 55:22.971
Mitch: Revolutionary.
I mean, you know--

55:23.015 --> 55:24.582
Goran:
I'm excited to meet this guy.

55:24.625 --> 55:28.368
I'm sure he's been watching us,
keeping tabs.

55:28.412 --> 55:32.198
I always sensed his presence,
but I didn't think it was here.

55:32.241 --> 55:34.635
But Wally confirmed he was here.

55:34.679 --> 55:36.768
This, in fact, is
a perfect time to meet him,

55:36.811 --> 55:39.727
because he operates best
in chaos.

55:39.771 --> 55:41.250
- And there is chaos.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

55:41.294 --> 55:42.469
Obviously,
our lead actor is gone, right?

55:42.513 --> 55:44.079
You know what?
That makes sense.

55:44.123 --> 55:45.342
That seems like the type of
personality that he is.

55:45.385 --> 55:47.082
He loves chaos.

55:47.126 --> 55:48.867
Yeah. Well, you're about to
bring it full force here.

55:48.910 --> 55:50.216
Mitch:
We're going to bring it on.

55:50.259 --> 55:51.783
Goran:
I've never been on a production

55:51.826 --> 55:53.785
where the guy
intentionally killed himself.

55:56.744 --> 55:58.355
Yeah. I'm Rick.

55:58.398 --> 55:59.747
Goran:
Hey, man. Nice to meet you.

55:59.791 --> 56:01.619
I thought he was bullshitting.
Yeah.

56:01.662 --> 56:03.490
- It is Rick.
- Okay.

56:03.534 --> 56:05.536
Where do you want to go, there,
Hemingway? Look at this guy.

56:05.579 --> 56:06.928
[horn honking]

56:06.972 --> 56:09.844
Wow. All right.

56:09.888 --> 56:13.674
Let's follow him, man.
Where's he going?

56:13.718 --> 56:15.197
- That's Rick. Out of nowhere.
- What a coinci--

56:15.241 --> 56:16.808
This guy is tailing us,
I'll tell you.

56:16.851 --> 56:18.331
He came out of nowhere.
What did I say?

56:18.375 --> 56:20.377
Wow.

56:22.030 --> 56:23.423
Wow.

56:23.467 --> 56:26.513
Goran:
I didn't know he had a beard.

56:35.740 --> 56:36.958
Rick, come over here.
Come over here.

56:37.002 --> 56:38.786
What? What, Mitch?

56:38.830 --> 56:41.441
I called you over. Man, I got
some bad news. I got some bad--

56:41.485 --> 56:42.703
- Hold on.
- What? Mitch, relax.

56:42.747 --> 56:43.965
- I can't relax.
- Mitch. Mitch.

56:44.009 --> 56:45.227
Rinaldo. Rinaldo.

56:45.271 --> 56:46.620
I don't want to
hear about Rinaldo.

56:46.664 --> 56:48.317
- We're going home tomorrow.
- No, no--

56:48.361 --> 56:49.667
- Mitch, we're done.
- No, no.

56:49.710 --> 56:52.844
So, while all this
is coming down,

56:52.887 --> 56:55.368
I went to the one person
I thought I could trust.

56:55.412 --> 56:56.935
Are you sitting down?
You're standing up.

56:56.978 --> 56:58.545
Take it easy.

56:58.589 --> 57:00.460
- He's dead.
- He's not dead, Mitch.

57:00.504 --> 57:02.027
- He is dead.
- Mitch.

57:02.070 --> 57:03.289
- He is dead.
- Mitch--

57:03.332 --> 57:04.595
- We saw him die.
- Calm down.

57:04.638 --> 57:05.683
- He's dead.
- He died. You saw him.

57:05.726 --> 57:07.119
- No, Mitch.
- He died.

57:07.162 --> 57:08.381
- He's gone.
- They were all fake deaths

57:08.425 --> 57:09.991
- in the show.
- Goran: No.

57:10.035 --> 57:11.428
I know there were fake deaths,
and this was supposed--

57:11.471 --> 57:12.690
We were supposed to
film him drinking and--

57:12.733 --> 57:13.778
- Goran: Yeah.
- Rick: No.

57:13.821 --> 57:15.083
--snorting coke and everything.

57:15.127 --> 57:17.085
He's gone, sir. He's gone.

57:17.129 --> 57:18.826
- This is Goran, our director.
- Goran?

57:18.870 --> 57:20.349
- You've never met him.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

57:20.393 --> 57:21.394
- Goran, Rick.
- I heard a lot about you.

57:21.438 --> 57:22.961
Rick, Goran. I'm sorry.

57:23.004 --> 57:25.267
It's too bad we met
under these circumstances.

57:25.311 --> 57:27.487
I have to conclude-- I mean,
now, it's coming together.

57:27.531 --> 57:29.924
And still, there's a lot of,
you know, moving pieces,

57:29.968 --> 57:32.840
but he's an evil genius,
this guy.

57:32.884 --> 57:35.103
He's got no pulse.
They pulled him out of there.

57:35.147 --> 57:37.454
- I tried to give him CPR.
- Yeah, that actor is out.

57:37.497 --> 57:38.890
Seriously.
I tried to give him CPR.

57:38.933 --> 57:40.326
Rick:
No, no, you didn't, Mitch.

57:40.369 --> 57:41.806
He blew his brains out
with that cocaine.

57:41.849 --> 57:43.155
This guy went ballistic.

57:43.198 --> 57:46.506
Mitch,
I don't know if Goran knows.

57:46.550 --> 57:48.595
The show's not real.

57:48.639 --> 57:50.684
He's not dead.

57:50.728 --> 57:54.209
I arranged the ambulance.
I arranged the fake cocaine.

57:54.253 --> 57:55.863
- Come on, man.
- It's flour.

57:55.907 --> 57:58.649
- Don't tell me that.
- Okay? I arranged everything.

57:58.692 --> 57:59.911
[Goran laughing]

57:59.954 --> 58:02.087
This is all off-script.

58:02.130 --> 58:03.349
He's not dead, Mitch.

58:03.392 --> 58:04.829
- Don't tell me that.
- Mitch.

58:04.872 --> 58:08.789
I now realize, I guess,
I was played.

58:08.833 --> 58:12.706
I was a mark.
These were all actors.

58:12.750 --> 58:13.968
- I gave him CPR.
- Mitch.

58:14.012 --> 58:15.230
I'm sure
he didn't have a pulse.

58:15.274 --> 58:16.710
- Mitch--
- He had no pulse.

58:16.754 --> 58:17.755
- No, no, no.
- How did you stop his pulse?

58:17.798 --> 58:19.147
We lowered his blood rate.

58:19.191 --> 58:20.758
Tell me
you're telling me the truth.

58:20.801 --> 58:22.586
- I'm telling you the truth.
- He checked his pulse.

58:22.629 --> 58:24.239
- No.
- I wasn't by myself.

58:24.283 --> 58:25.502
- Mitch, he's alive and well.
- He checked his pulse.

58:25.545 --> 58:26.981
I didn't check it properly.

58:27.025 --> 58:29.897
He's an actor.
He's an actor. You're an actor.

58:29.941 --> 58:31.246
He was an actor.

58:31.290 --> 58:33.118
No, he is an actor.
You're an actor.

58:33.161 --> 58:35.990
- He's dead.
- He's not dead.

58:36.034 --> 58:38.602
It turns out they were actors.

58:38.645 --> 58:42.431
They weren't playing actors.
They weren't playing themselves.

58:42.475 --> 58:46.131
They weren't playing, you know,
the doorman or the concierge.

58:46.174 --> 58:50.483
They were actors,
and I was completely deceived.

58:50.527 --> 58:52.050
[laughing]

58:52.093 --> 58:53.965
- This is part of the show?
- Yes.

58:54.008 --> 58:56.663
Well, congratulations.
[laughing]

58:56.707 --> 58:58.491
Mitch, it's not real.

58:58.535 --> 59:02.016
And I'm still trying to piece
together my role in this,

59:02.060 --> 59:03.365
Rinaldo's role in this.

59:03.409 --> 59:05.106
I'm questioning Doug's role
in this.

59:05.150 --> 59:06.630
It is very confusing.

59:06.673 --> 59:08.153
- Rick: Yes, Mitch.
- Hey, wake up, man.

59:08.196 --> 59:09.589
Don't be in shock still.
It's okay.

59:09.633 --> 59:10.895
- Rick: Mitch.
- I believe him.

59:10.938 --> 59:12.418
Rick:
How was Rinaldo's acting?

59:12.461 --> 59:13.898
Can we use this guy again?

59:13.941 --> 59:17.249
It seems chaotic,
but I think Rick does have

59:17.292 --> 59:20.600
some sort of method
to his madness.

59:20.644 --> 59:23.298
I think he was really rocked,
Rick.

59:23.342 --> 59:24.691
Rick:
But it's okay.

59:24.735 --> 59:25.953
He thought, really,
this guy passed.

59:25.997 --> 59:27.607
Rick:
Mitch, you're my friend.

59:27.651 --> 59:29.435
This is the cost
of doing business.

59:29.478 --> 59:31.045
Jesus Christ, do I need a drink.

59:31.089 --> 59:34.005
In retrospect, I should
have seen these red flags.

59:40.011 --> 59:41.926
Mitch.

59:41.969 --> 59:46.800
Man, if that ain't
the ultimate mind-fuck...

59:46.844 --> 59:49.890
- I still can't process.
- I'm sor--

59:49.934 --> 59:52.850
Like, I'm still, like,
speechless,

59:52.893 --> 59:54.852
which, you know,
is tough for me.

59:54.895 --> 59:59.073
He was misdirecting us.
He was deflecting us.

59:59.117 --> 01:00:00.335
He was, like,
putting up fake people,

01:00:00.379 --> 01:00:02.294
fake, you know, villains.

01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:03.687
Don't be so negative, man.

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.124
I know you thought
you lost Rinaldo,

01:00:06.167 --> 01:00:08.387
but that's not the case, is it?

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.824
That's not the case.

01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:12.652
- Mitch: I guess it's not.
- We sh--

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:15.481
[laughing]
Hey! This guy's everywhere.

01:00:15.524 --> 01:00:19.398
Mitch, you sure you
don't need-- [laughing]

01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:21.530
You going to be all right or
what, man? Doesn't look like--

01:00:21.574 --> 01:00:23.010
I'm not going to be.

01:00:23.054 --> 01:00:26.231
Well, here.
Cheers to Rinaldo being alive.

01:00:26.274 --> 01:00:28.799
- Yes.
- Okay?

01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:31.540
You know, this has been
really a draining experience.

01:00:31.584 --> 01:00:33.717
It's taken a lot out of me
emotionally, physically,

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.675
mentally, financially.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:39.331
I got nothing. I got nothing.

01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:43.465
But I'm still standing.

01:00:43.509 --> 01:00:45.946
Actually, still sitting, but
standing, if you want to get--

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:48.688
I guess I should have expected
the unexpected.

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:51.299
Well, I guess you should have,
and you should have prepared me.

01:00:51.343 --> 01:00:53.040
I mean, I'm in shock, man.

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:54.563
Well, how could I prepare
you for something--

01:00:54.607 --> 01:00:56.174
I've been through--

01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:57.741
The adrenalin, watching
this guy drop in front of me.

01:00:57.784 --> 01:00:59.003
I mean, I heard him
screaming and stuff.

01:00:59.046 --> 01:01:00.352
That was--

01:01:00.395 --> 01:01:02.615
You know, him
being taken out of there

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:06.706
as a cardiac arrest
or a dead body, whatever,

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.709
we thought he was a goner,
Don Punta.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:12.712
And then Rick springs it on us
that no, it's part of the--

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.496
His game plan.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.935
And that, in and of itself,

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:19.893
is what, you know,
rings parallels

01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:22.069
with Orson Welles's
last production,

01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:23.854
The Other Side of the Wind.

01:01:23.897 --> 01:01:25.856
- You know what?
- I don't know.

01:01:25.899 --> 01:01:27.684
You know what? Listen.

01:01:27.727 --> 01:01:30.338
It's okay, man. Roll with the
punches. Roll with the punches.

01:01:30.382 --> 01:01:31.905
I'm just...

01:01:31.949 --> 01:01:33.080
Don't worry, man.
Let's roll with the punches.

01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:34.473
- Okay.
- Let's see.

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:35.474
- Okay. I appreciate that.
- Come with me.

01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:36.736
Let's take a little walk.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.042
Mitch:
And you know what?

01:01:38.085 --> 01:01:40.218
We still have
some great footage.

01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:44.265
I think we could turn this into
a documentary about a film

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:46.050
being made of a documentary
being made of a film,

01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:49.096
sort of like the Orson Welles
The Other Side of the Wind

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.011
but, you know, on steroids.

01:01:51.055 --> 01:01:53.797
- I'll see you in Toronto.
- Goran: All right. [laughing]

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.842
Look where he is.
He's here again.

01:01:55.886 --> 01:01:58.889
This guy's unbelievable.
Say hi, Mitch.

01:01:58.932 --> 01:02:00.760
I have nothing
to say to him, actually.

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:02.153
- All right.
- Nothing to say to him.

01:02:02.196 --> 01:02:03.589
Rick:
Mitch, you're not talking to me?

01:02:03.632 --> 01:02:05.199
I'm not talking to you.

01:02:05.243 --> 01:02:07.636
Goran: I wonder if
that was even cocaine

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.377
this guy was doing
in front of me.

01:02:09.421 --> 01:02:11.945
All I can say is...

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:13.904
That guy's a hell of
an actor, I'll tell you.

01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:15.644
I didn't think
he was that good an actor.

01:02:15.688 --> 01:02:17.298
- I've never seen anyone...
- That was amazing.

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:20.040
...act like they're dead.
Completely convinced me.

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:23.783
Well, maybe it's restoring
my faith in acting.

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:26.046
And you know,
I thought I knew it all,

01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:28.179
saw it all.

01:02:28.222 --> 01:02:31.573
Maybe there's another film
or show left in me, so--

01:02:31.617 --> 01:02:33.488
Oh, you know what, my friend?

01:02:33.532 --> 01:02:36.100
Give me a little time. I think
I could, like, pick myself up.

01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:37.623
Yeah, you can. Sure you can.

01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:39.843
Mitch:
You know, I could fight it.

01:02:39.886 --> 01:02:41.496
- Goran: Absolutely.
- Mitch: I'm down but not out.

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.107
Goran: That's how I see
you, my friend: a fighter.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:44.369
I'm down but not out.

01:02:44.412 --> 01:02:45.805
Don't let this throw you.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.807
I'm sure he's thrown you
curveballs before.

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:51.724
[coughing]

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.987
Bad throat, though.
But I'm not dead.

01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:56.685
I think I could come back.
I love film.

01:02:56.729 --> 01:02:59.123
It's never over for me.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.473
He always used to say, Rick,
"It's over. We're done.

01:03:01.516 --> 01:03:03.127
This is the last scene.
We're done."

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:05.694
I say I don't want it to be
over. I love filmmaking.

01:03:05.738 --> 01:03:08.393
I love acting.
I love producing, you know.

01:03:08.436 --> 01:03:09.960
And I can't see it over.

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:12.919
I mean, you know,
I'm back for a little loop here

01:03:12.963 --> 01:03:17.010
with this Rinaldo thing.

01:03:17.054 --> 01:03:18.838
Anyway, let's go back
to the villa.

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:20.448
Here's the villa.
Let's see what goes down now.

01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:22.363
Let's see what's here.

01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:25.279
Goran:
You got to be shitting me.

01:03:25.323 --> 01:03:28.543
Oh, my God.
You son of a bitch.

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:32.591
You made us think you were...
You going to let us in?

01:03:32.634 --> 01:03:35.159
That OD stunt?

01:03:35.202 --> 01:03:37.204
[chuckling]

01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:39.163
You know, hey,
let me in on it, guys.

01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:42.035
You know what you
put this guy through?

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:44.211
- That's unbelievable.
- Rinaldo, you were dead.

01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:45.865
You were dead.
I felt your pulse.

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.388
Rinaldo: Maybe it was an
overdose or something.

01:03:47.432 --> 01:03:49.129
There was no pulse.
You had no pulse.

01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:51.131
How did you do that? That's
the best acting I've ever seen.

01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:52.829
We thought you died.

01:03:52.872 --> 01:03:54.874
I was, like, giving you
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.397
- Yeah, man. He really cared.
- And I care about you.

01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:57.659
- Rinaldo: Thank you.
- I'm devastated.

01:03:57.703 --> 01:03:59.183
Shut the fuck up! I don't care.

01:03:59.226 --> 01:04:00.488
- Stay there. Stay there.
- See, right there.

01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:02.099
- I'm going. I'm gone.
- Okay.

01:04:02.142 --> 01:04:03.535
- You had a project with me.
- You made up your mind.

01:04:03.578 --> 01:04:05.189
- You fuck yourself!
- It's your own choice.

01:04:05.232 --> 01:04:06.886
Enough of this.
I'm tired. I'm done!

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.888
It's your own choice, man, okay?

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:10.324
It's your choice. Remember.

01:04:10.368 --> 01:04:12.849
This guy, man,
he was broken down.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:15.068
Now, are you with him, or no?
Are you in the same boat?

01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:16.417
No, no. Let me in, buddy.

01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:18.637
Come on. Come on before--

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.117
He's a hell of a guy, man.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.509
He's such a nice guy.
I don't know why...

01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:22.902
Before he comes in.

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.164
...you destroyed him
as an actor there.

01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:26.123
But hey, you're alive, man.

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:27.907
Let me feel you.

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:30.823
There you are, eh?
Come on back, bro.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.434
Come on in here, guys.
Get in here.

01:04:33.478 --> 01:04:35.175
Give the guy a hug. Come on.

01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:38.265
That's it. There you go.

01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:09.601
[laughing]
See, Goran? He's real.

01:05:09.644 --> 01:05:11.908
I'm not delusional.

01:05:11.951 --> 01:05:14.519
[laughing] You're wrong.

01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:16.695
You all thought I was crazy.

01:05:16.738 --> 01:05:18.001
You thought
I was crazy. I'm not crazy.

01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:19.741
I'm not crazy.

01:05:19.785 --> 01:05:22.440
Goran, he's at the Nacional.

01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:24.746
I saw him. I saw him.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.531
I talked to him.

01:05:26.574 --> 01:05:29.534
He's real. I touched him.
I talked to him.

01:05:29.577 --> 01:05:31.840
I got it!

01:05:31.884 --> 01:05:33.494
Oh, my God. I got it. I got it.

01:05:33.538 --> 01:05:35.453
Hey, Goran. Goran, I got it.

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:37.411
I got it. The tunnel.

01:05:37.455 --> 01:05:40.632
Driving off into
the sunset. It's brilliant.

01:05:40.675 --> 01:05:43.852
It's amazing. It came to me.
It was like a dream.

01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:46.507
What is it, my friend? What is
it? What is it? What is it?

01:05:46.551 --> 01:05:47.813
- He's here.
- Oh, okay. He's here, is he?

01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:49.119
He's here. Rick's here in Cuba.

01:05:49.162 --> 01:05:50.903
Okay. He's here in Cuba.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.165
There is no Rick.
Just be honest.

01:05:52.209 --> 01:05:53.601
I was told
at the boutique hotel.

01:05:53.645 --> 01:05:54.602
- Be honest with me, Mitch.
- We were there.

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:55.603
We were there.

01:05:55.647 --> 01:05:56.909
He had a room there.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.389
We were supposed to
meet with him.

01:05:58.432 --> 01:06:00.434
I was told initially
he went to the Nacional.

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:03.176
I went to the Nacional. Couldn't
find him. Went to Riviera.

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.004
- Yeah, I know. I was with you.
- And then--

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:07.398
They kicked us out of there
because someone had a camera.

01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:08.877
- And then--
- Then we went

01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:10.270
to the boutique hotel.
We couldn't even--

01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:11.924
- But he was there.
- He was there, was he?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.882
He was there. He was there.
He had a room there.

01:06:13.926 --> 01:06:15.493
- We were going to--
- Didn't you tell me

01:06:15.536 --> 01:06:18.931
that you saw his ghost
walking around Old Havana?

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.325
Do you remember telling me that?

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:24.284
How much more of this bullshit
do you want me to buy?

01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:26.199
And not only that.
What kind of production is this?

01:06:26.243 --> 01:06:27.809
You got no permits.

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:29.681
We get kicked out of
every place we've been at.

01:06:29.724 --> 01:06:31.291
- Precisely.
- I'm up to here with this.

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:33.467
That's how Rick works.
We never use permits.

01:06:33.511 --> 01:06:35.078
- We don't use permits.
- What Rick?

01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:36.601
- It's guerrilla filmmaking.
- There is no Rick.

01:06:36.644 --> 01:06:37.906
- There is Rick.
- No, there's--

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:39.430
He directed me.
He told me to do this.

01:06:39.473 --> 01:06:41.693
I've been on this production
a couple of times,

01:06:41.736 --> 01:06:43.260
and I've never met this Rick.

01:06:43.303 --> 01:06:45.044
Don't you get it?

01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:47.829
I'm the wing man. Rick is alive.

01:06:47.873 --> 01:06:49.701
He's real, but he didn't want
to be the wing man.

01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.312
I'm the wing man.
I morphed into the wing man.

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:53.792
I morphed into Rick.

01:06:53.835 --> 01:06:56.142
You understand now?
You really understand?

01:06:56.186 --> 01:06:57.491
Can I ask you a question?

01:06:57.535 --> 01:06:58.927
You can ask me
anything you want.

01:06:58.971 --> 01:07:00.799
Don't take this
in any wrong way,

01:07:00.842 --> 01:07:04.063
but... have you ever had,
you know, therapy before?

01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:07.240
Rick is alive,
but I've become Rick.

01:07:07.284 --> 01:07:11.636
Does that make any sense?

01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:14.595
Goran:
Good luck, pal.

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:16.597
Where you going? Goran, Goran.

01:07:16.641 --> 01:07:20.862
Goran, it was a hero's
journey, man. I'm the hero.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:23.039
Goran: The world
doesn't need another hero.

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:24.736
I hope you can live
with yourself.

01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:26.868
You don't treat people
like that.

01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:28.566
You know, we put our souls out
for your production,

01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:30.307
and this is how you do it?

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:33.136
Dude, I don't think I ever
want to see you again.

01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:34.833
And one more thing.

01:07:34.876 --> 01:07:37.053
You morphing into Rick,
whether he's real or not,

01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:39.925
it just implies
where you're going to end up.

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:42.101
You're going to
be all alone, all right?

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:44.103
Think that through.

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:45.931
And if that hurts,
I'm glad it does,

01:07:45.974 --> 01:07:47.367
because you can't imagine
how I feel,

01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:51.067
some of the others
on your production feel.

01:08:13.045 --> 01:08:16.004
Mitch:
You smell the rain?

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:19.006
There's a storm coming.

01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:20.705
Wow.

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:23.099
What a great way to go.

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:41.421
Rick: You know,
there's three types of people

01:08:41.465 --> 01:08:43.118
in this world:
people that make things happen,

01:08:43.162 --> 01:08:44.424
people that watch things happen,

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:46.209
and people
that wonder what happened.

01:08:46.252 --> 01:08:49.167
And really, that moment--

01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:51.475
Really, you have defining
moments in your life,

01:08:51.518 --> 01:08:53.955
and that was really one of them.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.416
Rick:
You know, he loved the rain.

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:21.374
And he's in the water,

01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:24.377
and he's always having
this dream that he's drowning.

01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:28.163
Because in the dream is--
he doesn't have enough time.

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:31.036
You know, he might have
had a day or two to live.

01:09:31.078 --> 01:09:34.082
Because he had
something to say, so...

01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:45.180
But he gave me
the greatest gift back.

01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:17.300
Rick: You know,
then he died shortly after,

01:10:17.343 --> 01:10:19.040
but he was a good man.

01:10:19.084 --> 01:10:21.260
I mean, beautiful man,
beautiful man.

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:31.314
â™ª

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:49.593
â™ª

01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:54.179
â™ª

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:27.386
â™ª
