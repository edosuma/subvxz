- Yay! Called it!
- Whoo-hoo! That's good news!

09:13.970 --> 09:16.462
But, uh, Mrs. Smith,
could you come with me?

09:18.141 --> 09:20.428
Hi, honey,
so, here's the thing --

09:20.518 --> 09:22.134
These guys --
They want to completely

09:22.228 --> 09:24.890
remove my penis and use it
as an alien's heart.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.063
And we just need you
to sign off on it.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.640
- What?!
- Uh-Oh.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.853
Maybe we got a problem here
after all, guys. Yikes.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.688
His penis will be replaced
with a sophisticated prosthetic.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.115
Now, there's a wide range
of options to choose from.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.818
They're all
in this catalogue.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.074
I don't care about prosthetics.
This is insane.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.996
What do you people
think you're doing?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.994
I understand your feelings,
Mrs. Smith.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.325
Oh, I don't think you do.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.330
I bring my husband in
for emergency treatment.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.003
He's gone an hour.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.627
And now you want his penis,
and you hand me some... catalog.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.674
It's -- It's --
It's -- It's -- I mean...

09:54.761 --> 09:56.672
Sheesh. Well, there you go.
Sorry.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.925
I know it's hard
to understand,

09:59.015 --> 10:01.803
but on Earth,
love comes first.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.930
There are those that believe,
Mr. Smith,

10:04.020 --> 10:06.762
that Shrimply Pibbles represents
love between all life.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.813
His fate will determine

10:08.900 --> 10:11.642
the fate of hundreds of billions
of sentient life-forms.

10:11.736 --> 10:15.024
Whoa! Whoa.
So, billions of life-forms?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.822
Hundreds of billions.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.775
I mean, Jerry,
y-you didn't explain

10:19.869 --> 10:22.531
the full gravity
of the situation.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.363
Uh, well, Beth,
I don't think your decision

10:24.457 --> 10:26.198
should be based
on politics.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.203
Who could argue
with a wife's decision

10:28.294 --> 10:30.205
to keep her lover intact?

10:30.296 --> 10:32.879
Well, I don't think that's
fair at all, Jerry. At all.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.879
In fact, the whole paradigm
has sexist overtones.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.960
Beth, can we talk
about this privately?

10:38.054 --> 10:39.965
You know, I think
the bottom line is, Jerry,

10:40.056 --> 10:43.139
if you want to keep your penis,
you should say, out loud,

10:43.226 --> 10:45.137
"I prefer to keep
my penis."

10:45.228 --> 10:47.970
But, Beth, what kind of man
would say something like that

10:48.064 --> 10:50.305
if the universe needed
his penis?!

10:50.567 --> 10:52.308
Well, Jerry,
what kind of wife would I be

10:52.569 --> 10:55.482
if I did anything
to stand in your way?

10:59.826 --> 11:02.158
<i>Hey, listen,
is your mouth tiny and small?</i>

11:02.245 --> 11:03.861
<i>Then why don't you come
to Lil' Bits...</i>

11:03.955 --> 11:05.241
<i>Lil' Bits!</i>

11:05.331 --> 11:06.992
...where the food is tiny.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.744
It looks like regular food,
but really tiny.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.325
You can put it in your mouth
and eat it.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.793
Nothing gets stuck
in your lips.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.712
It's just tiny and tiny
and fits right --

11:13.798 --> 11:15.709
- Fits right in.
- <i>Lil' Bits!</i>

11:15.800 --> 11:19.714
We got tiny lasagne,
tiny pizza, tiny pie.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.013
Mmm!
Little, tiny fried eggs.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.557
Oh, shit.
We got tiny people.

11:25.643 --> 11:26.678

11:26.769 --> 11:28.134
You hungry?
Come on down.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.351
Eat some fucking shit,
you fucking stupid bitch.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.065
Just kidding.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.189
You've got some time to kill
before the procedure,

11:36.279 --> 11:38.691

you'd like to, uh,

11:38.781 --> 11:40.237

one last time.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.690

11:45.079 --> 11:46.569
Here's some porn.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.825
And there's
an alien towel.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.452
I actually got that
on another planet.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.032
So it is an alien towel

11:51.127 --> 11:52.959
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.220

12:04.307 --> 12:05.217
Hmm.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.181
Uh, yeah,
just masturbating!

12:10.271 --> 12:11.978
I forgot to mention,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.397

records open on my desktop,

12:14.651 --> 12:16.938
and I trust you to confine
your activities...

12:17.028 --> 12:19.235

- Absolutely!

12:19.322 --> 12:20.778
Good luck.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.866
My God!

12:24.953 --> 12:27.786

15:17.333 --> 15:19.324

about Shrimply Pibbles.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.001
Word of Jerry Smith

17:35.096 --> 17:37.007
trying to weasel out
of his penis donation

17:37.098 --> 17:39.214
has spread across the galaxy.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.675
Beings everywhere
have come together

17:41.936 --> 17:45.099
to offer what little they have
to help save Shrimply's life.

17:45.189 --> 17:49.148
Enough to pay for a brand-new,
state-of-the-art synthetic heart

17:49.235 --> 17:52.694
that will be even better
than Mr. Smith's pathetic penis.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.234
Wait! That was an option
the whole time?!

17:55.324 --> 17:56.735
You guys suck!

17:56.993 --> 17:59.701
Yeah. We suck.
Are you still here?

17:59.954 --> 18:01.444
Okay, Jerry.
Let's head home.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.496
I can't leave now.
Everyone hates me.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.665
Unfortunately,
there's no surgical procedure

18:05.751 --> 18:08.368
that can fix that.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.829
Or is there?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.756
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.592
- Nano-Doctor.
- Nano-Doctor.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.261
- Nano-Scalpel.
- Nano-Scalpel.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.712
Okay. We're ready.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.305
Not so fast!

18:21.392 --> 18:23.349
Mr. Smith? What are you doing?
Are you insane?!

18:23.436 --> 18:24.642
I'm a good person,

18:24.729 --> 18:27.517
and I demand
that you cut off my penis

18:27.607 --> 18:30.019
and put it
in that man's chest.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.224
That's not how it works!

18:31.319 --> 18:33.060
Well, you're gonna
make it work.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.367
I'm Octopus Man!

18:41.454 --> 18:44.742
I'm Octopus Man!

18:44.832 --> 18:49.497
I'm a marine biologist
who was bitten by an octopus.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.292
And now I'm --
I help people.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.294
I save people.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.127
I'm a troublesome
octopus person.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.462
Uh-Oh. I gotta save
some trouble

19:01.557 --> 19:05.016
'cause here comes
a trouble mite.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.763
Gross!

19:07.021 --> 19:10.184
Does all interdimensional TV
have to rely on juvenile violence?

19:10.274 --> 19:11.981
Well, Summer, maybe people that
create things aren't

19:12.068 --> 19:14.685
concerned with your delicate
sensibilities, you know?

19:14.779 --> 19:16.520
Maybe the species
that communicate with each other

19:16.614 --> 19:18.321
through the filter
of your comfort

19:18.407 --> 19:20.318
are less evolved than
the ones that just communicate!

19:20.409 --> 19:22.150
Maybe your problems
are your own to deal with,

19:22.244 --> 19:23.826
and maybe the public giving
a shit about your feelings

19:24.080 --> 19:25.320
is a one-way ticket
to extinction!

19:25.414 --> 19:26.779
Geez, Morty.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.203
I take it Cathrine Hefflefinger
hasn't texted you back yet.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.783
I don't want to talk
about it.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.539
- Okay, guys, let's go home.
- Where's Dad?

19:32.630 --> 19:34.621
<i>Breaking news--
Shrimply Pibbles is being</i>

19:34.715 --> 19:37.127
<i>held hostage by the human
known as Jerry Smith.</i>

19:37.218 --> 19:38.925
<i>Remove my penis!</i>

19:39.011 --> 19:40.922
- Holy crap!
- It's cool. It's fine.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.924
It's gotta be from
an alternate reality, right?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.677
- Are you sure?
- I don't know.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.305
Do it! Do it!
Remove my penis!

19:48.396 --> 19:49.932
Sir, put the gun down

19:50.022 --> 19:51.683
and step away
from Mr. Pibbles!

19:51.774 --> 19:53.515
- Jerry!
- Dad, what are you doing?!

19:53.609 --> 19:55.691
I'm a good person.
I'm a good person.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.689
Where did he get a gun?
Who gave him a gun?

19:57.780 --> 20:00.192
That's not a gun.
That's the XP-20 XS.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.489
Ah!

20:06.789 --> 20:07.950
Oh, my god.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.781
I'm a good person.

20:16.507 --> 20:17.747
No!

20:17.842 --> 20:20.960
Nooooo!

20:27.184 --> 20:28.470
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

20:28.561 --> 20:30.393
<i>This is
my butthole ice cream parlor.</i>

20:30.479 --> 20:32.891
<i>I got all kinds of ice cream --
peanut butter and jelly...</i>

20:33.149 --> 20:34.435
<i>...vanilla...</i>

20:34.525 --> 20:35.765
<i>...chocolate...</i>

20:35.860 --> 20:37.521
<i>...and every flavor</i>

20:37.611 --> 20:38.851
<i>served out of a butthole...</i>

20:38.946 --> 20:40.732
<i>just like you're back home.</i>

20:40.823 --> 20:41.813
- Dad!
- Dad!

20:41.907 --> 20:43.989
What happened?
Where am I?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.566
Was it all a dream?

20:45.661 --> 20:47.447
No, you were shot
like 50 times.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.996
57. Thankfully,
you're in a super-sophisticated

20:50.082 --> 20:51.572
alien hospital,

20:51.667 --> 20:53.704
so it was basically like
getting a splinter removed.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.876
All -- All I wanted
was for everyone to like me.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.620
Jerry, remember that time
you left a comment

20:57.715 --> 20:59.581
underneath that YouTube video
and someone replied

20:59.675 --> 21:01.632
and called you a dumb-ass,
so you replied and told them,

21:01.719 --> 21:03.710
"it takes one to know one,"
and you stayed up all night

21:03.804 --> 21:05.420
hitting "refresh"
on your browser

21:05.514 --> 21:07.130
waiting for them to reply
and then you fell asleep crying?

21:07.224 --> 21:09.010
I remember it differently.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.559
This is like that.
You can't make people like you.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.852
You just have to wait
for hating you to bore them.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.054
You know, you're right.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.560
I shouldn't be motivated

21:16.650 --> 21:18.436
by other people's
opinions of me.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.733
All right, guys,
let's go home.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.106
If it's all the same
to you, Rick,

21:21.197 --> 21:22.653
I'd like to go
to the zoo...

21:22.740 --> 21:24.322
- With my family.
- What?!

21:24.408 --> 21:26.149
- What are you talking about?!
- Why would we do that?!

21:26.243 --> 21:27.483
- It's a stupid idea!
- What's the matter with you!?

21:27.578 --> 21:29.160
Don't be a piece of shit,
Jerry!

21:29.246 --> 21:30.486
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We'll go home.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.696
What the hell
is he talking about?!

21:31.791 --> 21:34.658
♪♪

22:10.788 --> 22:12.654
- Aah!
- I'm the Eyehole Man!

22:12.748 --> 22:14.489
What is going on? Aah!

22:14.583 --> 22:16.950
<i>Give me my Eyeholes!
I'm Eyehole Man!</i>

22:17.044 --> 22:18.626
That part of the cupboard
is mine, Jerry!

22:18.712 --> 22:20.202
Why do you
even have those?!

22:20.297 --> 22:21.537
<i>- Give me my Eyeholes!
- Help me, please!</i>

22:21.632 --> 22:23.088
<i>Get up on out of here

22:24.718 --> 22:26.083
Did you get any of that?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.169
It's-a good-a show!
