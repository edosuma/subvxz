WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:05.040
This programme contains strong
language.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.840
SHE LAUGHS

00:11.840 --> 00:15.800
'Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys.'

00:15.800 --> 00:18.560
# She's Mrs Brown

00:18.560 --> 00:21.400
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.400 --> 00:24.680
# Our Mrs Brown. #

00:40.480 --> 00:41.960
Oh it's good to be home!

00:41.960 --> 00:44.880
My God, Mrs Brown,
it was only one night!

00:44.880 --> 00:46.160
Is our house that bad?

00:46.160 --> 00:47.520
Course not, Maria, no.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.960
And it was lovely to wake up
to the triplets this morning,

00:49.960 --> 00:51.160
but I love me own bed.

00:51.160 --> 00:54.120
Well, Mark wanted to surprise you
with the finished kitchen.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.240
So believe me, it'll be worth it!

00:56.240 --> 00:58.360
Are you ready, Mark, love?

00:58.360 --> 01:00.120
Nearly, just a second.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.480
Oh, I'm not great at surprises.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.600
I know. Remember when you found out
you were pregnant on Dermot?

01:06.640 --> 01:08.520
Winnie! Sorry.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.000
Excuse me, Mammy? Was I a mistake?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.040
Huge!

01:16.040 --> 01:17.080
Not to me.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.400
After having three boys,

01:18.400 --> 01:20.560
you must have been thrilled
when I came along?

01:24.640 --> 01:25.680
Yeah, thrilled.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.960
Well, it's done.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.160
There's tea on the table
for everyone.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.240
Mammy, step in for your first
cup of tea in your new kitchen.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.240
I'd like to toast Mammy
on her new kitchen.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.680
ALL: Cheers!

01:48.680 --> 01:51.560
And I want to apologise to Mammy
that the new table is not here yet.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.680
Is it, Buster?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.360
It'll be here on Monday.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.440
I don't want a new table.
I'm keeping that one.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.120
But Mammy, you've had that years.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.280
Yes I have, and my mother
had it before me.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.040
Everything important in my life
has happened around that table.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.960
I was sitting at that table
when your father proposed to me.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.880
Mark, the first time I changed
your nappy was on that table.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.400
Dermot, when you went to prison,
I sat at that table and I cried.

02:19.400 --> 02:23.000
And Cathy, I can't count the amount
of times I sat around that table

02:23.000 --> 02:26.440
talking with you, after yet another
one of your boyfriends fucked off.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.480
All my memories are
embedded in this table.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.920
And most of yez
were conceived on it!

02:38.560 --> 02:39.680
Which end?

02:41.200 --> 02:42.800
Shut up, Dermot!

02:42.800 --> 02:45.600
Well, I agree, Mammy.
You keep the table.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.680
Yeah.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.840
My God, a new kitchen and
just in time for my wedding.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.920
ALL: Woo hoo!

02:53.920 --> 02:56.760
And it'll be a brilliant wedding,
with Maria organising the day.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.600
What? Maria?

02:58.600 --> 03:01.480
That's right. It's one of our
wedding presents to you and Dino.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.800
The other's a toaster.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.400
Shut up, Buster!

03:05.400 --> 03:07.080
But I already have one.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.320
OK. I'll change the toaster
for a sandwich maker.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.200
No, I mean I already have
a wedding organizer.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.520
Who?

03:15.520 --> 03:17.680
The staff at Wash & Blow
arranged La La Doggy,

03:17.680 --> 03:19.400
the fella off that telly programme,

03:19.400 --> 03:21.960
'Don't Tell The Big Fat Gypsy Bride
About The First Dance'.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.760
La La Doggy! He is great.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.480
But I'm sure you'll be much better,
Maria, I mean, you are family.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.160
No, no, it's fine.
I just wanted to help, that's all.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.800
I do have some good ideas, though.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.360
Do you think would he mind me
suggesting them, Rory?

03:37.360 --> 03:40.880
Er, no. I'm sure
he'll be fine with that.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.400
Fine.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.240
Who's this?

03:50.240 --> 03:53.520
Ah, um, this is La La Doggy.
The wedding arranger.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.560
And you are?

03:54.560 --> 03:56.080
Mother of the brid...

03:59.480 --> 04:00.680
His mother.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.960
Hello. I see we have
some work to do, then.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.400
I beg your pardon?

04:08.400 --> 04:10.960
Mrs Brown, I expected you
to be more elegant.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.760
And I expected you to be
yellow with a curly antenna,

04:13.760 --> 04:15.200
so we're both disappointed.

04:17.960 --> 04:20.280
La La's just going
through some ideas.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.920
Colours and the theme and that.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.200
Theme, let me think...

04:23.200 --> 04:25.720
Two people getting married,
till death do us part...

04:25.720 --> 04:28.520
I have an idea, here's the theme -
it's a fuckin' wedding!

04:31.760 --> 04:32.840
What are you staring at?

04:32.840 --> 04:35.960
I was wondering what we'd
put you in. Lilac maybe?

04:35.960 --> 04:38.560
I'd like you looking
a little more feminine.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.320
He has a fuckin' point, really.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.960
Listen, you, you're not Gok Wan.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.920
You're not even Gok Two!

04:54.720 --> 04:55.960
I dress myself.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.120
La La, would you like a cup of tea?

04:59.120 --> 05:00.320
Yes, please.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.560
I'll get it, Rory. In a takeaway cup.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.600
Hello.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.720
La La, this is my sister, Cathy.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.200
Hello. Hello, La La. I'm a fan.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.720
I love your fashion ideas.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.840
Really?

05:15.200 --> 05:17.120
And this is her boyfriend, Mick.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.720
Hello!

05:20.640 --> 05:22.880
Hello. I'll see you to the door.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.200
He just looked me up and down.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.240
Me too!

05:28.240 --> 05:29.720
Me too!

05:31.720 --> 05:33.480
Well, I can understand that.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.160
What? But me?

05:37.400 --> 05:38.800
Do you want a cup of tea, Cathy?

05:38.800 --> 05:41.000
Yes, please. Here.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.200
Mammy, is there a guest list
for the wedding reception?

05:44.200 --> 05:47.760
I don't know, I...Rory,
how does this work with guests?

05:47.760 --> 05:50.120
I mean, do we invite
your uncles and your aunties?

05:50.120 --> 05:52.560
I suppose you can invite
whoever you like.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.920
As long as they're OK with it
being a gay wedding.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.640
None of your uncles and aunties, so.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.200
I was wondering if I could
invite Mick's parents?

06:01.200 --> 06:03.680
What? Oh, it's just that
they're up in Dublin that weekend

06:03.680 --> 06:06.120
and what with the wedding,
I'll only see them for one day,

06:06.120 --> 06:08.360
but if they can come along
to the wedding...?

06:08.360 --> 06:09.720
I've no problem with that.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.840
Just as long as they know
it's a gay wedding.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.320
Oh, they're fine,
they're broad-minded.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.960
Actually they're very,
very broad-minded.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.160
I wouldn't like the first time
I meet them to be a family event.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.200
Could I not meet them
before the wedding?

06:22.200 --> 06:24.200
Well, they arrive up
on Thursday night.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.480
But you're on duty.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.200
Well, invite them over here.
I'll look after them.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.840
It'll give me a chance to meet them.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.800
Maybe not, they're a bit odd.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.960
Odd? Like what?

06:33.960 --> 06:36.880
To be honest with you, I wouldn't be
surprised if they were swingers.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.920
What age are they?

06:41.920 --> 06:45.120
For God's sake, Rory,
it doesn't matter what age they are.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.600
Everybody likes a bit
of swing now and then!

06:53.560 --> 06:54.800
There ya go, pet.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.360
Thanks.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.920
Where ya up to now, love?

06:57.920 --> 06:59.600
Louis Armstrong.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.280
Louis Armstrong is
coming to the wedding?

07:02.280 --> 07:05.520
No, I'm on a different list now.
Jazz singers.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.800
Mick the Dick's parents
are coming for a visit

07:07.800 --> 07:10.080
and Mick was saying
that they're swingers.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.800
I'm trying to come up with
a bit of background music.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.520
You know, jazz stuff.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.240
Ah, right.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.760
Paddy Cole.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.040
Paddy Cole. Very good, Winnie.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.000
What's that?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.240
Oh, I'm knitting Sharon
a shawl for the wedding.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.600
"The Virgin Wrap"?

07:31.600 --> 07:34.040
Yeah, I thought I'd keep her,
you know, right.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.200
Winnie, it's not called Virgin Wrap
because she might be...

07:38.200 --> 07:41.960
It's called Virgin Wrap because
you knit it with virgin wool.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.520
Oh, right...

07:46.120 --> 07:48.640
Where will I get virgin wool?

07:48.640 --> 07:50.120
Off an ugly sheep.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.960
Right.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.000
Winnie, I swear to God!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.280
Sometimes you're so feckin' naive!

08:02.760 --> 08:04.440
Now, back to the swingers...

08:06.240 --> 08:07.560
Hello, ladies!

08:07.560 --> 08:09.440
What do you want, Buster?

08:09.440 --> 08:10.640
Rory's looking to buy a car

08:10.640 --> 08:12.880
and I think I've found
the one he'd like for sale.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.120
And does the owner know
he's selling it yet?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.800
Very good.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.280
I just want to get him
something reliable.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.520
Not going to happen, son.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.280
If it has tyres or testicles,
you'd have trouble with it.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.120
Do you know Rory's coming down
to Foley's after work?

08:27.120 --> 08:28.720
Let me think...

08:28.720 --> 08:30.800
He said something about
staying in tonight

08:30.800 --> 08:32.600
and putting a patch
on his marigolds.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.000
Did he? No!

08:35.000 --> 08:37.680
I don't know is the answer, Buster.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.080
Rory spends more time with
La La Doggy these days

08:42.080 --> 08:43.720
than he does with his own mother.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.040
Mick, will you stop worrying
about your parents?

08:47.040 --> 08:48.880
Mammy'll just take it in her stride.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.040
Do you think so?

08:50.040 --> 08:52.040
Yes, she'll handle whatever pops up.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.320
You know what I mean.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.320
You're right.
I'm sure with six children,

08:59.320 --> 09:02.760
there's very little that could
shock your mother. Exactly.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.840
Like what?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.680
What?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.720
Well, what might pop up
that might shock Mammy?

09:09.720 --> 09:12.640
Oh, no, no, I don't mean
anything specific. It's just...

09:12.640 --> 09:15.840
my father's liable to go in there
with no inhibitions, you know.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.080
Mammy'll be fine.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.120
Mind you, if he goes too far,

09:20.120 --> 09:23.600
he's liable to end up with his
inhibitions cut off and in a bag!

09:26.720 --> 09:28.400
What's the name of that count?

09:31.480 --> 09:32.880
Count Basie!

09:32.880 --> 09:33.960
Count Basie.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.680
THEY LAUGH UPROARIOUSLY

09:47.360 --> 09:50.840
I'd wish you'd have let me
cook something for you.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.080
Oh, not at all. We ate at the hotel.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.600
We're just fine, aren't we, Poochie?

09:55.600 --> 09:58.960
Yes, we are, my little cheerleader.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.760
Go, Poochie! Go, Poochie!
I LOVE YOU!

10:07.680 --> 10:10.200
SHE FORCES A LAUGH

10:10.200 --> 10:11.480
That's nice.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.200
Well, it's lovely
to meet you at last.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.280
I was a bit of a swinger
meself back in the day.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.200
Back in the day! Stop that now.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.720
I bet you could swing along
with the best of us even now.

10:25.720 --> 10:26.840
Well, no, I...

10:26.840 --> 10:28.040
Well, yeah...

10:29.840 --> 10:31.560
Oh, it's been so long.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.360
And I bet you'd like
to see more of us.

10:33.360 --> 10:37.080
Well, we'll see how the romance
goes with Cathy and Mick.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.320
Ah, the young love birds.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.360
Yes.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.280
Well, just so's you know,

10:43.280 --> 10:44.880
you won't be disappointed.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.600
I have a huge penis.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.840
Actually, so have I.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.760
I'll get more drinks.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.560
What a pair of fruitcakes!

11:35.800 --> 11:37.240
How's it going, Agnes?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.880
Winnie, they're odd.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.400
She's like a feckin' teenager!

11:40.400 --> 11:41.600
And he...

11:41.600 --> 11:42.800
Yeah?

11:45.200 --> 11:46.920
He says he has a huge cock!

12:05.280 --> 12:06.760
Get out, do it again!

12:11.480 --> 12:12.960
Pair of fuckin' oddballs!

12:15.840 --> 12:17.400
How's it going, Agnes?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.240
Oh Winnie, they're odd.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.720
She thinks she's a teenager and he...

12:21.720 --> 12:22.760
Yeah?

12:25.080 --> 12:26.880
He says he has a huge penis!

12:28.760 --> 12:30.480
Agnes, they all say that, love.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.000
Not when they're a guest in
somebody's sitting room, they don't!

12:36.520 --> 12:39.800
I suppose. Is there anything
you need, love? No.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.680
I'm going to give them some wine and
I'm going to put on a bit of jazz.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.200
That might calm them down.
I'll see ya, love.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.200
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

12:52.200 --> 12:54.600
Ah, jazz! Very nice!

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
Now you're talking.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.280
Now, how about a bit of fun?

13:29.160 --> 13:30.360
There ya go, pet.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.640
Oh, Winnie...

13:34.880 --> 13:36.200
..his willy!

13:38.600 --> 13:41.640
It was like one of the candles
in St Jarlath's Church!

13:43.680 --> 13:45.880
That had been burning
all through Easter week!

13:47.520 --> 13:50.040
Well, Mammy,
Mick did try to warn ya.

13:50.040 --> 13:53.680
And his wife. Not a stitch on her!

13:53.680 --> 13:56.960
Just stood there with her
titties hanging down.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.800
One each side of her belly button!

14:00.960 --> 14:02.840
They were swingers, Mammy!

14:02.840 --> 14:04.280
They certainly were!

14:05.800 --> 14:07.520
Every time she feckin' moved!

14:09.240 --> 14:11.640
What she needed was a good bra.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.680
For God's sake.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.600
So, what do you think, Rory?

14:19.600 --> 14:22.400
I love the colour.
It's a nice car, isn't it, Dino?

14:22.400 --> 14:25.560
Aye, but it seems
really hard to stop it.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.360
Awww, that's just, er,
a bit of air in the brake line.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.720
New brakes, you see.
You just need to pump it!

14:31.720 --> 14:33.680
It'll be gone in a day or two.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.640
Rory, will you keep them calm
in here?

14:36.640 --> 14:40.360
Your mammy's after having
a close encounter of the willy kind!

14:43.080 --> 14:44.480
Are you OK, Mammy?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.200
I'm fine, love.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.840
I'm sure that willy winked at me!

14:52.440 --> 14:55.960
Right, well, here's your car keys.
Good luck with your new car.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.400
See yas!

14:57.400 --> 14:59.040
Did you get a new car, Rory?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.360
Yes, I did!

15:00.360 --> 15:01.400
WE did.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.160
Oh, sorry, Dino. WE did.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.520
It's lovely.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.840
C'mon, I'll give you a spin in it.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.320
Look who I bumped into!
Hello, Mrs Brown.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.600
Hello, Father Damien. Trevor,
get Father Damien a cup of tea.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.840
Ah, no, thanks.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.480
Father Damien, I'm glad
you called around.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.000
I wanted to make some arrangement
to have Rory's marriage

15:21.000 --> 15:23.280
blessed in the church.
Would Saturday be a good day?

15:23.280 --> 15:25.080
Mrs Brown, Rory and Dino

15:25.080 --> 15:28.400
will never be married
in the eyes of the church.

15:28.400 --> 15:31.840
I know that. I'm just looking
for a blessing of some sort.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.280
Perhaps you could explain it better,
Trevor?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.920
Ah, no,
I believe this one is all yours.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.480
Look, the church
won't bless something

15:40.480 --> 15:43.680
it not only doesn't recognise,
but is against.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.080
Exactly what is it against?

15:45.080 --> 15:46.840
The church's position on marriage

15:46.840 --> 15:49.600
is that it can only exist
between a man and a woman.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.920
I know that, but what's
the church's position on love?

15:52.920 --> 15:54.560
Sorry?

15:54.560 --> 15:57.400
Er, well...

15:57.400 --> 16:00.560
Well, there are
many different types of love.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.240
I mean, like love for one's family

16:02.240 --> 16:06.160
is completely different to love
for one's... Let's say pet.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.360
Really? And what's the difference?

16:08.360 --> 16:11.440
Sorry? Explain the difference
between those two loves.

16:11.440 --> 16:14.800
Well, well... It's like...
Look, Father,

16:14.800 --> 16:17.480
I know Rory and Dino
would need the Pope's permission

16:17.480 --> 16:18.720
to get married in the church,

16:18.720 --> 16:21.200
but they don't need anybody's
permission to fall in love.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.840
And as for the ceremony,
I don't give a shite

16:23.840 --> 16:26.320
if they jump over a brush!

16:26.320 --> 16:28.640
But you show me
in any Bible anywhere

16:28.640 --> 16:31.560
where Jesus Christ
refused to sanctify love.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.760
Would you like me
to show you out, Father?

16:37.760 --> 16:39.840
Yes, I think so.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.600
La La should be here any minute now.

16:46.600 --> 16:47.960
DOORBELL RINGS

16:47.960 --> 16:50.000
I'll get it.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.760
Now, Mammy,
you just let La La get on with it.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.960
Don't interfere.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.240
Excuse me, I speak my mind!
I'm not going to sit here

16:57.240 --> 17:00.320
with me mouth shut if this gobshite
is taking rubbish!

17:02.240 --> 17:05.760
Mammy, tonight is about
Rory and Dino's wedding.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.200
Sorry, you're right.
Hello, Tinky-Winky!

17:10.720 --> 17:12.160
It's La La.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.320
Of course it is.

17:13.320 --> 17:16.120
A far more sensible name.

17:16.120 --> 17:18.040
So, what's the big wedding idea?

17:18.040 --> 17:20.080
An underwater wedding.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.880
Brilliant!

17:22.880 --> 17:23.960
Wow.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.920
He's off his fuckin' trolley!

17:27.480 --> 17:29.960
Me hat'll get ruined!

17:29.960 --> 17:32.200
No, no, we all wear wetsuits
and oxygen tanks.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.520
That'll be a marvellous
wedding album.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.320
"Who's that with the snorkel?"

17:36.320 --> 17:38.720
"Fucked if I know,
they all look the same to me!"

17:41.080 --> 17:43.040
Rory, you can't even swim!

17:43.040 --> 17:46.840
That's right.
What's the chances of drowning?

17:46.840 --> 17:49.320
100%, I'd say.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.440
I'd like to suggest
something more traditional.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
I've actually drawn pictures.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.040
We don't want to see pictures!

17:58.040 --> 18:01.120
If my wife wants to show pictures,
she shows pictures!

18:01.120 --> 18:02.560
Thanks, love.

18:04.480 --> 18:07.040
The theme is pure love.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.200
The happy couple are in white suits

18:09.200 --> 18:12.920
and you walk down the aisle to
the song Nights In White Satin.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.280
Ah, now, Maria, now you're talking!

18:16.280 --> 18:18.440
Boring!

18:18.440 --> 18:21.680
It's a gay wedding,
it has to make a statement.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.560
Why? What?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.560
Why does it have to be a gay wedding?

18:25.560 --> 18:27.320
Why does it have to
make a statement?

18:27.320 --> 18:29.720
Why can't it just be
that Rory and Dino are in love

18:29.720 --> 18:31.840
and they want to commit
themselves with that love

18:31.840 --> 18:33.800
together for the rest
of their lives?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.200
We don't need a circus,

18:35.200 --> 18:37.520
we don't need wetsuits
and feckin' oxygen tanks!

18:37.520 --> 18:39.080
My idea's much better!

18:39.080 --> 18:41.480
It's an underwater wedding!
That's silly!

18:41.480 --> 18:43.280
Shut up, the two of yas!

18:43.280 --> 18:45.280
Now look, there's only two people
driving this

18:45.280 --> 18:47.080
and that's Rory and Dino.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.160
It's up to them to choose
the wedding that THEY want.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.840
So, boys, what's it going to be?

18:54.360 --> 18:56.240
Oh, Dino, what do you think?

18:56.240 --> 18:58.640
I don't know, what do you think?

18:58.640 --> 19:00.320
Oh, I don't know, what do you think?

19:00.320 --> 19:02.000
Oh, I don't know!

19:02.000 --> 19:04.520
For Christ's sake!
One of yas decide.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.200
We're missing Strictly Come Dancing!

19:06.200 --> 19:07.880
ALL: Strictly!

19:07.880 --> 19:10.520
Where's the remote control?
You bastards!

19:10.520 --> 19:13.520
The whole lot of you!

19:13.520 --> 19:15.120
Rory! Rory, love!

19:19.600 --> 19:21.720
Well, I think we all know
who's to blame for that!

19:21.720 --> 19:23.320
We certainly do.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.800
Yes, we do.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.000
Grandad, ya bastard.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.800
Why did you rush them?

19:36.960 --> 19:38.840
Hiya, Winnie.
How are ya, love?

19:38.840 --> 19:42.000
Cup of tea, love? Oh, I'd love one!
Cheers.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.560
Where's the milk?

19:43.560 --> 19:44.840
In the fridge.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.840
Where's the fridge?

19:46.840 --> 19:48.800
I'm fucked if I know!

19:48.800 --> 19:52.760
I know a fridge door when I see one,
and I don't see one in this kitchen.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.280
Jesus, a new kitchen
and they forget the fridge!

19:55.280 --> 19:57.200
MICROWAVE PINGS

19:57.200 --> 20:00.480
Oh, you're just in time.
I baked a cake in the microwave.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.280
I've never baked in a microwave.

20:02.280 --> 20:06.000
Me neither! They give you
a recipe book and all with it.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.600
Just a small slice for me, Agnes.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.360
What the hell is that?

20:37.360 --> 20:39.280
You need a bigger cake tin.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.720
No, no, it wasn't like that
when it went in.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.600
That oven's shite!

20:44.600 --> 20:47.600
Well, you can tell her.
No, you tell her. No!

20:47.600 --> 20:50.120
Well, somebody's going to have
to tell her.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.200
No way!
It should be a family member.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.920
You married into this family.
You're a Brown now.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.480
I want a divorce!

21:00.120 --> 21:02.600
Come on, Dermot!
You're her favourite.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.320
She's less likely to kill you.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.160
OK, but I'm telling her
through the hatch.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.520
That way I can make a run for it.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.960
Hiya, Mammy.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.400
Hello, son.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.120
You're just in time.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.520
Come in, I have cake.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.080
Er, no, you're fine.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.240
I'll stay here.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.880
I spoke to Rory.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.600
Oh, good -
he was very upset last night.

21:26.600 --> 21:30.120
Me too!
Nicky in the dance-off on Strictly!

21:30.120 --> 21:33.040
No! About the wedding.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.480
Oh.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.600
You tell him to get home here
as soon as he can.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.120
We'll make it work. Won't we, son?

21:38.120 --> 21:39.480
The thing is, Mammy...

21:40.760 --> 21:43.920
Open that door!
You know how quick she can move!

21:47.040 --> 21:51.000
The thing is, Rory and Dino
got married this morning.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.960
Just the two of them, on their own.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.800
Did you hear me, Mammy?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.360
Where the hell has she gone?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.400
Jesus!

22:03.400 --> 22:05.760
Rory did what? Why? When?

22:05.760 --> 22:07.360
Married. This morning.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.400
Without his mother? Yes!
Just like that? Just like that.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.760
Rory, you're here! Thank God!

22:13.760 --> 22:15.280
Out of the way, Cathy, move!

22:17.760 --> 22:19.960
Come back here, you bastard!

22:19.960 --> 22:21.560
Maria, is this true?

22:22.680 --> 22:24.680
First I heard of it!

22:25.760 --> 22:27.400
Let me go and check with Dermot.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.960
Freeze!

22:33.240 --> 22:36.000
It's true, Mammy. I'm so sorry.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.320
Well, there's only one thing
to be said, isn't there?

22:41.920 --> 22:43.520
Thank fuck!

22:46.320 --> 22:49.160
What? Good man, Rory!

22:49.160 --> 22:50.600
What is it, Agnes?

22:50.600 --> 22:52.480
Rory and Dino, they've eloped.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.760
Ah, feck it! And after me
buying new flippers!

22:59.320 --> 23:01.000
They might take them back.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.960
Mammy, you don't mind about
there not being a big wedding?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.440
Mind?

23:07.440 --> 23:11.800
I don't want to see my Rory
as a tit in white satin.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.240
Or drowning in a tankful
of seahorses.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.760
I want to see my Rory as my Rory.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.600
So do I.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.040
Good, well,
you get in touch with him then.

23:22.040 --> 23:25.520
Tell him to get home.
Him and Dino, his husband,

23:25.520 --> 23:28.000
to get back here
as quick as they can.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.280
We'll throw a surprise party
for them!

23:30.280 --> 23:31.800
That's a great idea!

23:31.800 --> 23:32.960
Cup of tea, love?

23:32.960 --> 23:34.240
I have it, Mammy.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.800
Where did you get that milk?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.760
In the fridge!

23:40.760 --> 23:43.160
They hid the fuckin' fridge!

23:48.280 --> 23:49.840
What the hell is that?

23:49.840 --> 23:52.400
It's a cake I baked
in the microwave.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.320
It's no good, Cathy.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.240
Well, did you follow
every bit of the recipe?

23:57.240 --> 24:00.520
Every bit. Three eggs,
cup of milk,

24:00.520 --> 24:02.640
45 ounces of flour.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.160
"Four to five ounces of flour."

24:09.960 --> 24:13.160
I can't believe we're getting three
series out of that fuckin' joke!

24:20.840 --> 24:23.000
Right, that's 50 balloons there.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.720
Just pull that string
and they'll all come down together.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.760
Right, that'll be your job.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.360
We all come out of hiding
in the kitchen and shout "Surprise",

24:30.360 --> 24:32.200
you pull the string.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.360
Pull the string...OK.
You'd better hide behind that chair.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.600
Winnie, I don't know
if I've ever been more excited!

24:38.600 --> 24:42.440
Remember that coach trip when you
whipped off your knickers? Winnie!

24:44.440 --> 24:47.480
I'm just making a comment,
not a fuckin' comparison!

24:47.480 --> 24:49.240
DOORBELL RINGS

24:49.240 --> 24:50.320
I'll get it.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.880
That's them, everybody!
Into the kitchen!

24:52.880 --> 24:54.400
Quick, quick!

25:01.880 --> 25:03.440
Surprise!

25:05.800 --> 25:07.840
Buster, for feck's sake!

25:09.200 --> 25:10.960
Does that look like
a gay couple to you?

25:16.360 --> 25:18.680
Gather up those balloons
and put them back in.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.280
Look, everyone,
Rory wouldn't ring the doorbell.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.480
And I told him to honk his horn
when he's coming up the road.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.840
So don't be panicking.
We'll have plenty of time to hide.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.640
Father Damien,
what are you doing here?

25:29.640 --> 25:32.120
Like the rest of you, I came to
celebrate the happy couple.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.120
I thought you didn't accept
gay marriage?

25:34.120 --> 25:37.000
No, Mrs Brown.
I said the church was against it.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.360
I'm happy to celebrate love
in whatever shape it comes.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.880
HORN HONKS
That's them. Places!

25:47.760 --> 25:50.040
I think I'm going to wet meself
with excitement!

25:50.040 --> 25:51.680
Mammy... What?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.560
You deserve this moment.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.920
Thanks, love. Here we go!

26:46.120 --> 26:48.000
Mammy, I'm so sorry!

26:51.080 --> 26:53.640
Mammy, say something!

26:56.240 --> 26:58.600
I didn't like
this fuckin' kitchen anyway!
