WEBVTT

03:08.705 --> 03:10.161
Can't mess with me,

03:10.274 --> 03:11.841
got the world
by the balls, baby.

03:13.923 --> 03:16.545
Going for the full ride.

03:16.658 --> 03:19.114
Can't get over myself.

03:19.227 --> 03:21.979
14 years old, born in 1997.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.197
Here's my school I.D.

03:24.310 --> 03:26.132
I'm a junior in high school.

03:26.245 --> 03:28.768
I skipped the 9th grade,
skipped the 10th grade.

03:28.881 --> 03:31.337
Man, I'm gonna graduate at 16.

03:31.450 --> 03:33.505
Marry you right now,
come on, girl.

03:33.618 --> 03:35.808
Don't be scared.

03:35.921 --> 03:37.977
I'm gonna be educated.

03:38.090 --> 03:39.624
Come on, girl.

04:03.548 --> 04:05.181
Gonna rain.

04:09.853 --> 04:11.287
Gonna rain.

06:53.862 --> 06:56.684
Why did you wanna come here?

06:56.797 --> 06:58.987
I don't know,
it's a good place.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.289
Did you wanna take me here

07:01.402 --> 07:03.291
because it looks Frenchy
and cool-looking?

07:03.404 --> 07:05.460
No, I mean...

07:05.573 --> 07:07.295
Have you ever eaten here?

07:07.408 --> 07:09.230
Yeah...
When?

07:09.343 --> 07:10.798
Liar.

07:10.911 --> 07:12.433
You picked it out
because you thought

07:12.546 --> 07:13.968
that I would think you
were cool,

07:14.081 --> 07:16.070
which you're not,
you need to face it.

07:16.183 --> 07:17.973
You're very, very
un-cool, Louie.

07:18.086 --> 07:19.475
And you're very boring.

07:19.588 --> 07:20.709
Yeah, well,
you're not exactly--

07:20.822 --> 07:22.611
Yes, I am exactly.

07:22.724 --> 07:24.514
Come on, you think I'm awesome.

07:24.627 --> 07:26.449
I think you're okay,
it's just the way it is.

07:26.562 --> 07:28.652
We need to admit that
or just walk away.

07:28.765 --> 07:30.654
Okay.

07:30.767 --> 07:32.590
I wish the food would come.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.392
Why?
'Cause I'm starving.

07:34.505 --> 07:36.194
Really, you're starving?

07:36.307 --> 07:37.995
You can't just be hungry
for a second?

07:38.108 --> 07:39.430
Is your life gonna end?

07:39.543 --> 07:41.899
Do you have to constantly shove
bread in your hole?

07:42.012 --> 07:43.412
I don't have to.

07:52.122 --> 07:54.578
Ugh, my God.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.613
That guy who just walked in.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.150
Which one?

07:59.263 --> 08:01.685
The one over there
with the face.

08:01.798 --> 08:02.966
Yeah?

08:05.269 --> 08:07.292
Yeah, I think I did
something with him.

08:07.405 --> 08:08.693
You did something?

08:08.806 --> 08:11.229
What, you robbed a bank?

08:11.342 --> 08:13.198
No, I <i>did</i> something.

08:13.311 --> 08:14.600
Oh.

08:14.713 --> 08:16.702
Ten years ago, I don't know.

08:16.815 --> 08:18.336
My God.

08:18.449 --> 08:20.572
He didn't get old.

08:20.685 --> 08:22.207
So you slept with him.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.509
I don't know I don't remember.

08:24.622 --> 08:26.311
But you said you <i>did</i> something.

08:26.424 --> 08:28.814
Yeah, but I don't know if <i>this</i>

08:28.927 --> 08:30.983
is my mouth, my pussy, or...

08:31.096 --> 08:32.616
Or?

08:32.736 --> 08:33.894
Yeah, "or."

08:34.014 --> 08:35.755
I used to do that.

08:35.868 --> 08:37.591
You used to?
Yeah.

08:37.704 --> 08:39.326
Quite a bit.

08:39.439 --> 08:41.429
But now...

08:41.542 --> 08:45.167
Now, I mean, it's not like
I officially retired.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.504
It's not like they hung
my jersey from the rafters,

08:48.617 --> 08:52.208
but, definitely no one's been
in there for awhile.

08:52.321 --> 08:54.076
It just kinda tapered off.
It tapered off?

08:54.189 --> 08:55.444
Yeah.

08:55.557 --> 08:57.747
The constant flow of penises
into your asshole

08:57.860 --> 08:59.548
just-- just tapered off.

08:59.661 --> 09:02.618
Yeah, just died out.

09:02.731 --> 09:04.653
Must've been global warming
or something.

09:04.766 --> 09:06.455
Long term.

09:06.568 --> 09:07.723
Thank you.

09:07.836 --> 09:08.903
Thank you.

09:14.810 --> 09:16.865
Oh, my God.

09:16.978 --> 09:18.600
Th That's really go.

09:18.713 --> 09:20.047
Oh, my Jesus.

09:22.051 --> 09:23.373
Mmm.

09:23.486 --> 09:26.643
Kick a Jesus in the face,
this is delicious.

09:26.756 --> 09:28.211
I told you this
is a great place.

09:28.324 --> 09:30.047
Shut up, you didn't know.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.216
This is the best thing
I've ever tasted.

09:32.329 --> 09:34.920
I'm gonna eat this and then
go home and kill myself.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.788
I can't wait to eat
the shit that I take

09:36.901 --> 09:38.469
from eating this food.

09:44.193 --> 09:46.711
Oh, my God, that's the funniest
thing you ever said.

09:55.388 --> 09:58.277
Seriously, that's the first time
you've ever made me laugh.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.480
Louie, you're the unfunniest
comedian in the world.

10:01.593 --> 10:04.293
That's the first thing
you ever said that was funny.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.588
Look how pleased she is
with herself.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.156
Oh, she is so pleased.
No.

10:11.269 --> 10:12.658
Good for you.
Okay.

10:12.771 --> 10:14.708
Good for her.
Uh-huh.

10:18.741 --> 10:20.530
Just shut up.

10:20.643 --> 10:23.499
Last week, I took Serge
to Disney World.

10:23.612 --> 10:25.098
He was too scared
to go on any rides.

10:25.211 --> 10:26.686
It was such a bummer.

10:26.806 --> 10:29.602
I was so excited, I love rides.

10:29.715 --> 10:31.404
But he cried like
a little bitch every time

10:31.517 --> 10:33.240
I tried to get him
to go on one.

10:33.353 --> 10:35.008
Ah, poor little guy.

10:35.121 --> 10:36.309
What, poor?

10:36.422 --> 10:38.645
He's ten, he can't be
afraid of shit like that.

10:38.758 --> 10:40.447
If he's scared, he's scared.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.716
No, not.
What no not?

10:42.829 --> 10:44.584
I have to toughen him up.

10:44.697 --> 10:47.454
He can't go through life
being afraid of everything.

10:47.567 --> 10:49.722
Yeah, but it's normal to be
afraid of a ride.

10:49.835 --> 10:52.058
It's not like there's a lot
of challenges in life where

10:52.171 --> 10:54.661
you're gonna be thrown around
'til you puke.

10:54.774 --> 10:56.328
So it's--
you're building a skill

10:56.441 --> 10:58.665
he gets to use only
at Disney World.

10:58.778 --> 11:01.200
I get it, 'cause I hate rides.

11:01.313 --> 11:02.869
You get scared?

11:02.982 --> 11:05.772
Yeah, I went on
a Ferris wheel one time,

11:05.885 --> 11:08.107
and I screamed like
a little girl

11:08.220 --> 11:10.087
who just saw
a spider in her vagina.

11:14.659 --> 11:16.581
Oh, man.

11:16.694 --> 11:19.951
Oh, Jesus, you're on a roll.

11:20.064 --> 11:21.197
Whoa.

11:31.675 --> 11:33.297
No.

11:33.410 --> 11:35.533
Pamela...
What?

11:35.646 --> 11:36.901
Pamela...

11:37.014 --> 11:38.770
Oh, come on.

11:38.883 --> 11:40.739
Can't we just share a laugh?

11:40.852 --> 11:43.841
Why you gotta take it
to the level all the time?

11:43.954 --> 11:45.054
Look at your face.

11:47.391 --> 11:48.847
Look, we both know...

11:48.960 --> 11:50.449
Don't... don't, please.

11:50.562 --> 11:52.051
I just have this feeling--
Don't, no--

11:52.164 --> 11:54.086
--these feelings.
I don't want to see your bummed-out face

11:54.199 --> 11:55.654
at the end of this road.

11:55.767 --> 11:57.623
Just please
stop the car, Louie.

11:57.736 --> 11:59.125
Why?

11:59.238 --> 12:02.762
Because... I value your
friendship.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.264
And you're about to end it.

12:04.377 --> 12:05.732
Why are you saying that?

12:05.845 --> 12:07.601
Because...

12:07.714 --> 12:09.670
you keep pressing me, man.

12:09.783 --> 12:12.072
And I can't go that way.

12:12.185 --> 12:13.707
You're gonna get so bummed out
and you're gonna wanna stop

12:13.820 --> 12:15.943
hanging out with me.

12:16.056 --> 12:18.478
You're worried I'm not gonna
wanna hang out with you?

12:18.591 --> 12:20.112
Dude.

12:20.225 --> 12:22.147
Look, I know you don't
feel the same way about me.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.850
I get-- I know that,
I'm not stupid.

12:24.963 --> 12:27.986
I don't-- it's fine.

12:28.099 --> 12:30.455
I'm actually fine
with the way things are,

12:30.568 --> 12:33.159
that I'm in a constant state
of agitation.

12:33.272 --> 12:35.494
It's actually better
than any real requited

12:35.607 --> 12:37.563
love/sex thing I ever had.

12:37.676 --> 12:39.566
Okay, now you're depressing me.

12:39.679 --> 12:43.137
I'm-- no, I'm saying that I--
I wanna be your friend.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.306
And it's okay with me
that there's nothing else.

12:45.419 --> 12:46.486
But can I just--

12:49.424 --> 12:53.014
Can I just tell you one time
the way I feel about you?

12:53.127 --> 12:55.183
You wanna tell me?

12:55.296 --> 12:58.519
Yes, and I'll be your friend,
and I won't press you

12:58.632 --> 13:00.454
to be anything else, I promise,

13:00.567 --> 13:02.990
if you just let me
get it out one time.

13:03.103 --> 13:04.637
You wanna tell me?

13:06.540 --> 13:08.141
Yes... please.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.540
Go ahead.

13:18.553 --> 13:21.444
Pamela, I'm in love with you.

13:21.557 --> 13:24.447
Uh.
Yeah, it's that bad.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.716
You're so beautiful to me.

13:26.829 --> 13:28.430
Oh, okay, ew.
Just shut up!

13:30.766 --> 13:33.856
Let me tell you, let me.

13:33.969 --> 13:37.893
Every time I look at your face
or even remember it,

13:38.006 --> 13:40.495
it wrecks me.

13:40.608 --> 13:44.198
And the way you are with me,
and you're just fun,

13:44.311 --> 13:46.801
and you're--
you shit all over me

13:46.914 --> 13:48.915
and you make fun of me
and you're real.

13:52.252 --> 13:56.710
I don't have enough time in any
day to think about you enough.

13:56.823 --> 13:58.613
I feel like I'm gonna live
a thousand years

13:58.726 --> 14:00.247
'cause that's how
long it's gonna take me

14:00.360 --> 14:02.483
to have one thought about you,

14:02.596 --> 14:05.353
which is that I'm
crazy about you, Pamela.

14:05.466 --> 14:08.155
I don't wanna be
with anybody else.

14:08.268 --> 14:09.523
Louie...

14:09.636 --> 14:11.391
I don't.

14:11.504 --> 14:13.627
I really don't.

14:15.908 --> 14:19.965
I don't think about women
anymore, I think about you.

14:20.078 --> 14:23.469
I had a dream the other night
that you and I were on a train.

14:23.582 --> 14:27.172
We were on this train and you
were holding my hand.

14:27.285 --> 14:28.707
That's the whole dream.

14:28.820 --> 14:30.643
You were holding my hand.

14:30.756 --> 14:33.412
And I felt you holding my hand.

14:33.525 --> 14:36.816
I woke up and I couldn't
believe it wasn't real.

14:36.929 --> 14:39.353
I'm sick in love with you, Pam.

14:39.466 --> 14:41.855
It's like a condition.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.236
It's like polio.

14:46.307 --> 14:48.764
I feel like I'm gonna die
if I can't be with you.

14:48.877 --> 14:50.399
And I can't be with you.

14:50.512 --> 14:52.801
So I'm gonna die.

14:52.914 --> 14:55.271
And I don't care.

14:55.384 --> 14:59.274
'Cause I was brought into
existence to know you,

14:59.387 --> 15:01.944
and that's enough.

15:02.057 --> 15:04.780
The idea that you would
want me back,

15:04.893 --> 15:06.294
it's like greedy.

15:09.732 --> 15:13.156
I'm doing a bad job at this.

15:13.269 --> 15:14.302
No, you're not.

15:16.439 --> 15:18.195
I'm not?

15:18.308 --> 15:20.631
No.

15:20.744 --> 15:22.333
It's a good job.

15:22.446 --> 15:25.169
It's a... jewel.

15:25.282 --> 15:26.371
Good job.

15:26.484 --> 15:29.074
Is there any planet,

15:29.187 --> 15:31.677
any part of the world that you'd
feel any of the same--

15:31.790 --> 15:34.579
is there even a shard

15:34.692 --> 15:38.649
of a fraction of the feelings
that you have?

15:38.762 --> 15:40.385
Oh, no.

15:40.498 --> 15:42.386
I'm..
No...

15:42.499 --> 15:44.889
Yeah, no.

15:45.002 --> 15:47.036
Just not--
Yeah, no.

15:49.372 --> 15:52.562
But that was gorgeous.

15:52.675 --> 15:54.531
That made me feel really good.

15:54.644 --> 15:56.133
Good, good.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.102
All right.

15:58.215 --> 15:59.870
That was really...

15:59.983 --> 16:01.472
Nothing coming back
the other direction?

16:01.585 --> 16:04.309
Not even-- no, not no,
just nothing.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.244
No, sorry.

16:06.357 --> 16:08.246
But nice, good.

16:08.359 --> 16:09.814
Okay.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.782
Yeah.

16:11.895 --> 16:13.684
Okay.

16:13.797 --> 16:17.655
So, let's just keep
walking around...

16:17.768 --> 16:20.191
very awkwardly then.

16:20.304 --> 16:22.693
Great, let's continue.

16:22.806 --> 16:25.463
I need to go food shopping.

16:25.576 --> 16:28.366
Wanna help me?
Yes, anything.

16:28.479 --> 16:29.934
Oh, be careful.

16:30.047 --> 16:31.180
Okay.

16:40.683 --> 16:42.205
Sorry, it's really messy.

16:42.318 --> 16:43.340
All right.

16:43.453 --> 16:45.142
Just-- that's perfect.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.343
Thanks.

16:46.456 --> 16:48.931
Where's Serge?
Huh?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.399
Where is Serge?

16:50.519 --> 16:53.396
Oh, he, uh-- he has
a sleepover after soccer.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.697
You want something to drink?

17:00.810 --> 17:02.198
You wanna take a bath?

17:02.311 --> 17:03.600
You hungry?

17:03.713 --> 17:05.301
I'm kinda tired.

17:05.414 --> 17:07.670
Oh, okay.

17:07.783 --> 17:08.871
Well, we could just--

17:08.984 --> 17:11.585
I think I'm just gonna--
just go home.

17:13.144 --> 17:14.521
Okay.

17:19.695 --> 17:21.002
All right.

17:21.122 --> 17:22.615
I'll see ya later.

17:22.735 --> 17:24.092
Oh, oh... yes.

17:24.380 --> 17:27.811
I will see you...
later.

17:30.232 --> 17:31.919
All right, that was...

18:14.645 --> 18:15.720
Yeah?

18:15.939 --> 18:17.694
Hey.
Hey.

18:17.807 --> 18:21.497
Did you just ask me
if I wanted to take a bath?

18:21.610 --> 18:23.198
Yeah.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.700
Did you mean with you?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.876
Yep.

18:30.451 --> 18:32.674
You wanted to take a bath
with me?

18:32.787 --> 18:34.421
It was an impulse, so...

18:37.258 --> 18:40.515
You seriously wanted
to take a bath with me?

18:40.628 --> 18:42.317
Yeah, for a second,

18:42.430 --> 18:44.086
and not anymore
and never again,

18:44.199 --> 18:46.321
and eww, and goodbye.

18:46.434 --> 18:48.223
And Jesus,
did you just blow that,

18:48.336 --> 18:49.603
and goodbye.

19:22.388 --> 19:24.125
And 43-year-old couples
are funny

19:24.238 --> 19:26.694
because they act
like old couples.

19:26.807 --> 19:28.663
They act like your
grandparents.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.576
Because they're already
building those skills.

19:33.013 --> 19:34.435
You know that way your
grandparents are

19:34.548 --> 19:35.769
with each other?

19:35.882 --> 19:37.353
They didn't start that at 80.

19:38.197 --> 19:40.027
They started it
as soon as they figured out

19:40.147 --> 19:41.301
they're not getting out.

19:42.955 --> 19:45.277
I was with my friends,
this couple,

19:45.390 --> 19:48.013
and the guy,
he just goes for long walks.

19:48.126 --> 19:51.049
For hours, he just walks.

19:51.162 --> 19:52.917
And she doesn't get it.

19:53.030 --> 19:55.687
She's like,
"He just walks, it's weird.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.669
He just goes for, I don't know,
likes his long walks."

20:00.906 --> 20:02.662
Of course he does,

20:02.775 --> 20:04.743
he's running out the clock on
the rest of his life.

20:10.717 --> 20:12.940
He's trying to stay as far
as possible from the person

20:13.053 --> 20:15.943
he's gonna spend the rest
of his life with.

20:16.056 --> 20:17.577
And that's like
your grandparents,

20:17.690 --> 20:19.480
what your grandmother talks
about your grandfather.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.982
"Ah, he just stands
in the backyard for hours.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.662
He's crazy."

20:27.633 --> 20:30.489
That's 'cause he hates you
a lot!

20:30.602 --> 20:33.158
He hates you a lot.

20:33.271 --> 20:35.773
He hates you more than
he loves you, Grandma.

20:38.644 --> 20:42.902
And that's why every time your
mouth opens, he goes, "Ugh,"

20:43.015 --> 20:44.971
and then he just stands
out there looking

20:45.084 --> 20:46.485
at where the grass
meets the pavement.

20:54.162 --> 20:56.818
"Yeah?

20:56.931 --> 20:58.198
Comin'."
