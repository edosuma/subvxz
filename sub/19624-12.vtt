WEBVTT

00:03.261 --> 00:05.686
Tonight, everything is at stake!

00:05.687 --> 00:08.991
I worked hard and will not give up.

00:09.754 --> 00:13.045
For battles, no errors will be admitted,

00:13.080 --> 00:15.910
because there is only one Rob!

00:15.945 --> 00:19.220
I am eagerly waiting for a singer for my team.

00:20.380 --> 00:24.405
Helping Teams for biggest night so far,

00:25.185 --> 00:28.161
You gave an Oscar e Grammy, John Legend!

00:28.705 --> 00:31.970
One of the presenters of the Academy of Country Music Awards,

00:32.005 --> 00:34.292
star and labors of charts, Luke Bryan!

00:34.627 --> 00:38.607
Artist, producer and King Snapchat, DJ Khaled!

00:39.014 --> 00:42.181
E a estrela global, Cline Dion.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.800
- How old are you?  - 23.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.283
I want you to have 40.

00:46.456 --> 00:48.342
- I will not retreat.  - It's all right.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.412
I know this music and play for you.

00:56.413 --> 00:57.713
Too!

00:57.714 --> 01:00.802
Mentors will do what they need to prepare their artists.

01:08.138 --> 01:09.523
And it all...

01:09.524 --> 01:12.470
- Damn it!  This was too much!  - I went mad with it!

01:12.875 --> 01:14.175
Or nothing!

01:14.176 --> 01:15.851
It was a tough battle.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.352
After the last battle,

01:19.387 --> 01:23.319
stay tuned for a preview of Knockouts!

01:24.468 --> 01:27.061
Where artists show what they can do

01:27.096 --> 01:28.954
pras to go live stages!

01:29.131 --> 01:32.196
You are a new species we've never seen here.

01:32.403 --> 01:35.886
Final battles start now!

01:36.257 --> 01:39.886
I get excited when people leave.

01:39.921 --> 01:42.781
- I understand, I feel it too.  - You feel?!

01:42.782 --> 01:44.482
- Yes. - I hope you steal one of mine.

01:44.483 --> 01:46.035
- He used all his thefts?  - Yes.

01:46.036 --> 01:47.656
Thanks God!  She's out of the game.

01:47.657 --> 01:50.181
I'm comfortable with my team.

01:50.216 --> 01:51.521
They are so ...

01:51.556 --> 01:54.315
I do not know just are a cool group of people.

01:54.993 --> 01:57.107
Blake can help because they do not care about your team.

01:57.108 --> 01:59.668
Just to one of them, which is what will win.

02:01.167 --> 02:03.718
While mentors settle pros end battles,

02:03.719 --> 02:06.788
let's see Alicia and her counselor, DJ Khaled.

02:06.823 --> 02:09.425
You pass an energy that

02:09.460 --> 02:11.067
it takes hard work

02:11.068 --> 02:12.708
to do whatever it takes

02:12.743 --> 02:14.228
to reach the next level.

02:14.263 --> 02:16.120
- That's what we're talking about.  - Yes.

02:16.155 --> 02:18.769
Let us know the last battle Alicia Team.

02:18.909 --> 02:22.079
Lauryn Judd, 17 anos, de Draper City, Utah,

02:22.114 --> 02:26.376
contra, Lilli Passero, 26 anos, de Studio City, California.

02:27.450 --> 02:30.732
- Ai is Lilli and Lauryn.  - Hello, how are you?

02:30.733 --> 02:32.597
- This is DJ Khaled.  - Hi, how are you?

02:32.962 --> 02:36.034
DJ Khaled was nominated for several awards.

02:36.035 --> 02:40.446
He sang with various artists, Jay-Z, Drake, John Legend.

02:40.481 --> 02:42.234
He is awesome.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.235
How are you?

02:44.270 --> 02:45.643
- Great.  - Excited.

02:45.678 --> 02:47.146
How is school?

02:47.474 --> 02:49.223
I'm in high school.

02:49.258 --> 02:54.004
Spent part of the time in choir and drama lessons.

02:55.093 --> 02:57.635
I've been singing since I started talking.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.752
My parents give me a lot of support.

02:59.787 --> 03:01.247
If any turn chair,

03:01.248 --> 03:04.009
It will be like a validation that their support was worth it.

03:12.848 --> 03:15.890
You were singing "girls just wanna have fun"

03:15.925 --> 03:19.846
and two fun girls turned to you.

03:19.881 --> 03:21.843
Hey, three fun girls.

03:21.878 --> 03:23.968
It has a very cool style.

03:23.969 --> 03:25.302
It is something that is not taught.

03:25.337 --> 03:29.751
It has a lot in there and I would love to help you flourish.

03:29.786 --> 03:32.415
You are special and I hope we can work together.

03:32.450 --> 03:34.730
I choose Alicia.

03:34.765 --> 03:37.555
Girls they wanna have fun

03:37.590 --> 03:40.063
Lauryn is super young

03:40.064 --> 03:43.481
We have many things we can do and bring out.

03:43.995 --> 03:46.598
I grew up in a very musical environment.

03:46.633 --> 03:49.477
I am an actress and singer, but to pay the bills,

03:49.512 --> 03:51.980
I work as a waitress in a restaurant in LA.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:03.491 --> 04:04.888
This is so surreal,

04:04.923 --> 04:06.475
because I've been a waitress.

04:06.476 --> 04:08.756
- Was?  - I remember, as we sat

04:08.757 --> 04:11.458
and you said, "the last time, the waitress was very rude.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.315
I do not want to go back there. "

04:13.350 --> 04:20.291
If you choose me as your mentor

04:20.452 --> 04:21.908
I choose to Alicia.

04:21.942 --> 04:24.063
I'm excited about the Lilli.

04:24.285 --> 04:28.779
It has something of the 50s, 60, who is my world.

04:29.635 --> 04:31.824
I love Lilli and Lauryn together

04:31.859 --> 04:33.903
because they have unique styles.

04:33.938 --> 04:37.362
I loved the way it interpreted his songs in auditions.

04:37.397 --> 04:39.072
Was very good.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.890
I chose this song Brenda Holloway

04:40.891 --> 04:43.681
- with an  underground vibe  .  - Yes!

04:43.716 --> 04:45.170
The 1st time I heard this song,

04:45.171 --> 04:48.837
I put on my album "Unplugged" for MTV.

04:49.284 --> 04:50.868
How do I know this song,

04:50.869 --> 04:52.508
I will play for you today.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.751
I'll be your pianist.

04:56.621 --> 04:59.784
Alicia Keys will be our particular pianist.

04:59.819 --> 05:01.129
Madness!

05:08.380 --> 05:10.680
There is a well-known song

05:10.681 --> 05:11.981
but when we hear

05:11.982 --> 05:14.080
it is as if we knew all along.

05:14.081 --> 05:17.400
It is emotional and painful at the same time.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.980
Lilli's voice is stronger.

05:20.981 --> 05:22.380
He is more experienced

05:22.381 --> 05:25.030
in order to want to try new things.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.080
Lauryn has only 17 years

05:30.081 --> 05:32.280
and his voice is a little thinner.

05:33.580 --> 05:37.850
She has a little more originality in style.

05:38.970 --> 05:40.610
I love your tone in this song.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.360
- Thanks!  - It's so soft.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.230
Liked it.  It was chilling.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.780
And even with Alicia on the piano ...

05:47.781 --> 05:49.230
- It's pretty crazy.  - Insane.

05:49.231 --> 05:50.531
A little advice

05:50.532 --> 05:52.800
would you go decreasing the vocal gradually.

05:52.801 --> 05:54.101
It's just an idea.

05:59.780 --> 06:01.250
I'm too hear them.

06:01.251 --> 06:04.230
It's kind of tricky when ...

06:07.980 --> 06:10.980
Think not breathe between space.

06:10.981 --> 06:12.580
I will try this.

06:12.581 --> 06:17.950
The song mixes many spaces and rhythm,

06:17.951 --> 06:21.460
then you need to breathe at the right time.

06:21.461 --> 06:23.180
That's it.

06:23.181 --> 06:25.080
This is the power!

06:25.081 --> 06:26.780
It is our word of today: energy.

06:26.781 --> 06:28.081
Energy.

06:28.082 --> 06:30.160
Tomorrow I will see them with the band?

06:30.161 --> 06:32.400
I have some innovative ideas pros arrangements

06:32.401 --> 06:34.744
- And Khaled too.  - A breaks here and there.

06:34.745 --> 06:36.050
Cool ideas.

06:36.051 --> 06:38.105
- Can not wait.  - T super excited.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.580
In the next test, DJ Khaled and Alicia

06:40.581 --> 06:42.380
They work their ideas with the band.

06:42.381 --> 06:45.090
Musically, I hear several strings.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.982
Perhaps in the end ...

06:47.983 --> 06:49.410
- you'll be beautiful.  - Right.

06:49.411 --> 06:52.080
We can put down that part?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.030
It will fund and rocks!

06:57.680 --> 06:59.780
Liked it.  I'm happy with the breaks.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.580
Beautiful.

07:09.581 --> 07:11.793
I'm a little nervous to face Lauryn.

07:11.794 --> 07:14.510
She sings effortlessly.

07:14.511 --> 07:18.230
But I too identify with the song.

07:18.731 --> 07:22.680
I broke up with my boyfriend, who was my first love.

07:22.681 --> 07:26.580
It's powerful singing such a real letter to you.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.180
Lilli, I will ask you to choose

07:33.181 --> 07:34.580
something here ...

07:34.581 --> 07:35.881
I choose the first.

07:35.882 --> 07:37.280
Also like the first.

07:37.281 --> 07:39.330
And maybe in the end, Lauryn,

07:39.331 --> 07:41.648
You make the first "Every little bit hurts"

07:41.649 --> 07:44.580
and Lilli, you make the next "Every little bit hurts".

07:44.581 --> 07:46.003
And both make harmony.

07:46.004 --> 07:47.680
The two together?  Right.

07:50.530 --> 07:53.280
The audience needs to believe in the song.

07:54.580 --> 07:58.730
I saw it in the eyes of Lilli, when she sang ...

08:00.080 --> 08:02.530
But Lauryn was amazing too.

08:02.531 --> 08:04.670
It will be a difficult decision to Alicia.

08:05.730 --> 08:07.030
It was beautiful.

08:07.031 --> 08:09.180
- like the end of the division.  - Me too.

08:09.181 --> 08:12.580
The song is so calm and passionate.

08:12.581 --> 08:14.980
- I'm kind of ... - If you moved?

08:14.981 --> 08:16.760
Yes, now I'm thrilled.

08:16.761 --> 08:18.480
That's nice.  It is the goal.

08:18.481 --> 08:20.430
Perfect girls.  Is very good.

08:20.431 --> 08:23.300
The songs of the 60s have so much meaning,

08:23.301 --> 08:25.080
and they have assimilated it.

08:25.081 --> 08:27.100
I'm super proud.

08:27.101 --> 08:29.880
Glad you do not have to decide today.

08:29.881 --> 08:31.181
To follow...

08:32.580 --> 08:34.100
The last night of battles

08:34.101 --> 08:35.580
barbarizar go.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.380
Both brought new things.

08:37.381 --> 08:38.681
They impressed me.

08:38.682 --> 08:41.289
- I love your vibrato.  - I was inspired in you.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.720
So I enjoyed it so much.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.180
Look at him.

08:45.181 --> 08:47.930
- And then ... - I was shocked.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.030
We have a theft!

08:55.580 --> 08:58.580
Legendas: Breeh ~ Clarice ~ Erika ~ Gerson

08:58.581 --> 09:01.581
Subtitles: Luana Marcia ~ ~ ~ Neuber Veka

09:01.582 --> 09:04.582
Revision: Clarice ~ Luana

09:04.760 --> 09:07.460
We're back with the last night of battles.

09:07.461 --> 09:09.760
Are you excited.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.210
Best audience!

09:15.610 --> 09:17.040
It is the night of the battle.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.360
Lilli Passero and Lauryn Judd follow to the stage.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.860
Despite being young,

09:21.861 --> 09:24.440
I have devoted much time and effort for music.

09:24.441 --> 09:26.127
I'm not ready to go home.

09:26.128 --> 09:29.660
Entering the stage, the team Alicia, Lauryn Judd!

09:32.060 --> 09:35.160
Contra Lilli Passero!

09:35.161 --> 09:36.461
If you do not win the battle,

09:36.462 --> 09:38.260
back to work in the restaurant

09:38.261 --> 09:39.810
and sign up for auditions.

09:40.910 --> 09:43.760
Alicia sang and rocked with esa music,

09:43.761 --> 09:46.960
and I want to prove I can live up to.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.810
The battle begins now.

10:02.660 --> 10:07.734
Every little bit hurts

10:07.769 --> 10:11.252
Every little bit hurts

10:11.311 --> 10:13.860
Every night I cry Every night I sigh

10:13.861 --> 10:18.010
Every night I wonder why You treat me cold

10:18.011 --> 10:22.460
Yet you won't let me go

10:22.461 --> 10:25.660
Every little hurt counts

10:27.260 --> 10:30.660
Every little hurt counts

10:30.661 --> 10:32.358
You say you're comin' home

10:32.359 --> 10:34.650
Yet you never phone Leave me all alone

10:34.651 --> 10:37.660
My love is strong for you

10:37.661 --> 10:41.990
I'd do wrong for you

10:41.991 --> 10:45.690
I can't take this loneliness

10:45.848 --> 10:51.269
You've given me, yeah

10:51.861 --> 10:54.493
I can't go on

10:54.528 --> 10:59.467
Givin' my life away

11:00.560 --> 11:02.930
Come back to me

11:02.931 --> 11:05.560

11:05.561 --> 11:08.660
I can give you all the things

11:08.661 --> 11:13.060

11:13.061 --> 11:14.361
Good!

11:21.761 --> 11:25.220

11:26.460 --> 11:29.710
Every little bit hurts

11:29.711 --> 11:31.360
To you I'm a toy

11:31.361 --> 11:32.670
And you're the boy

11:32.671 --> 11:33.980
Who has to say

11:33.981 --> 11:36.760
When I should play

11:36.761 --> 11:40.060
- Yet you hurt me - Desert me

11:40.061 --> 11:42.340
Come back to me

11:42.341 --> 11:45.060

11:45.061 --> 11:48.030
I can give you all the things

11:52.261 --> 11:53.760
OK, that's it!

11:53.761 --> 11:56.800

These are Lauryn and Lilli

12:24.461 --> 12:27.560
battle in the Team Alicia, folks.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.360
Gwen Stefani, what do you think?

12:30.361 --> 12:33.260
Lauryn, you have a unique sound, and I love it.

12:33.261 --> 12:34.950
- Excellent job.  - Thanks.

12:34.951 --> 12:36.660
And Lilli, you hypnotize.

12:36.661 --> 12:38.360
You went...

12:39.260 --> 12:40.970
No one messes with you.

12:40.971 --> 12:44.660
Have to say, Lilli, that with this force,

12:44.661 --> 12:46.210
to me you were the winner.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.110
Thank you, mentor.  Adam?

12:49.111 --> 12:51.800
For me, this is 100% a matter of experience.

12:51.801 --> 12:53.660
Lauryn, you only have 17 years ...

12:53.661 --> 12:57.560
It's insane how you equal in skill and presence.

12:57.561 --> 13:00.760
I love the two, each time by a ...

13:00.761 --> 13:02.760
The only difference was the experience,

13:02.761 --> 13:07.160
and in this respect, Lilli, you have enough.

13:07.161 --> 13:11.060
So, Alicia, one can not choose Lilli.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.800
But both were excellent.

13:12.801 --> 13:14.360
- Thanks.  - Thank you, Adam.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.760
- Hi, Blake.  - Hello.

13:16.761 --> 13:19.060
What Lauryn did was great,

13:19.061 --> 13:21.360
because his voice is super different,

13:21.361 --> 13:23.110
and do all those little sounds

13:23.111 --> 13:25.060
and things perfectly.

13:25.061 --> 13:26.760
Also, you did your job

13:26.761 --> 13:29.060
and adapted to the song.

13:29.061 --> 13:32.260
I still think Lilli sings absurdly.

13:32.261 --> 13:35.560
Oh my!  Your voice is amazing.

13:35.561 --> 13:38.660
Everyone is thinking, "she's a star."

13:38.661 --> 13:39.961
Thanks.

13:39.962 --> 13:41.780
That's what I think, if it helps you.

13:41.781 --> 13:44.730
- OK thank you.  - Thanks, Blake and mentors.

13:44.731 --> 13:46.031
What did you think, Alicia?

13:46.032 --> 13:47.915
Girls, you are so lacradoras.

13:47.916 --> 13:50.395
I love you both,

13:50.396 --> 13:55.300
because both know exactly who they are.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.760
- Thanks.  - And both brought news!

13:57.761 --> 13:59.760
I was impressed.

14:00.061 --> 14:02.660
- How was it?  - The people make memes me ...

14:04.160 --> 14:05.700
They like me as a meme.

14:05.701 --> 14:09.432
Well, you have come a long,

14:09.467 --> 14:13.760
improving themselves individually.

14:13.761 --> 14:16.060
And it shows an artistic flair.

14:16.061 --> 14:18.160
And the time has come.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.960
Thank you, Alicia.  The decision will be difficult.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.365
Who won the battle?

14:27.880 --> 14:30.810
The winner of the battle ...

14:34.460 --> 14:35.760
Lilli is.

14:35.761 --> 14:37.760
Lilli, congratulations!

14:37.761 --> 14:39.560
You advance to the knockouts,

14:39.561 --> 14:41.460
representando Alicia Keys!

14:42.660 --> 14:44.840
I'm excited to go for knockouts.

14:44.841 --> 14:47.105
The more I get, the more I enjoy it.

14:47.106 --> 14:49.370
And the more I learn, the better I will become.

14:49.371 --> 14:52.360
I really want to show Alicia all I have to give.

14:52.661 --> 14:54.980
Lauryn, I would say something to your mentor?

14:54.981 --> 14:58.560
Thank you for choosing me for your team

14:58.561 --> 15:00.730
and for taking me under your wing.

15:00.731 --> 15:03.860
- I am grateful for the opportunity.  - Thank you, Lauryn.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.960
Many thanks to Lauryn Judd, ladies and gentlemen.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.960
- You are very good!  - Thanks.

15:12.071 --> 15:13.470
You are the only one.

15:13.471 --> 15:15.257
Lauryn and Lilli were fantastic.

15:15.258 --> 15:16.714
I was very proud of them.

15:16.715 --> 15:20.351
Lauryn super remained individual and detached.

15:20.352 --> 15:23.998
Lilli showed strength and aggression

15:23.999 --> 15:25.581
which was very exciting.

15:25.582 --> 15:27.525
So I chose to Lilli.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.621
Listen to me.

15:29.622 --> 15:32.093
- Lilli can win.  - I liked.

15:32.094 --> 15:34.199
Just observe.  That girl can win.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.424
- While Lilli advances ...  - What's up, guys?

15:36.425 --> 15:39.471
Adam is preparing its final double for the battle.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.989
This is more real than it seems.

15:40.990 --> 15:43.331
I know you will be nervous, but who knows ...

15:43.332 --> 15:45.186
You have to do it in front of audiences.

15:45.187 --> 15:48.466
It's a great victory.  They have fun and they will love them.

15:48.467 --> 15:49.839
That's it man.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.783
We're back with the battle.

15:57.986 --> 16:00.566
Now we know the last duo Adam ...

16:00.567 --> 16:01.873
- Ready?  - Yes.

16:01.874 --> 16:03.483
Here we go, back to work.

16:04.567 --> 16:08.232
Jesse Larson, 34 anos, de Minneapolis, Minnesota,

16:08.233 --> 16:12.691
contra Taylor Alexander, 25 anos, de Nashvile, Tennessee.

16:12.692 --> 16:14.150
In the 1st year of high school,

16:14.153 --> 16:15.588
I joined with some friends,

16:15.589 --> 16:16.902
and we started a band  punk ,

16:16.903 --> 16:19.814
but finally we started playing music  country  together.

16:26.233 --> 16:28.611
I realized it was a song of Cher.

16:28.646 --> 16:30.485
You are so strange and amazing.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.906
And I think that's really cool, and deserves to be awarded,

16:32.941 --> 16:35.029
- and you're on my team.  - Thank you very much.

16:35.030 --> 16:38.191
I made my first guitar at age 16 with my father.

16:38.192 --> 16:42.200
Make that guitar was one of the things that inspired me to play.

16:42.566 --> 16:45.272
I had great opportunities to work for Prince,

16:45.307 --> 16:46.994
guitar for Judith Hill.

16:46.995 --> 16:48.295
All I did before that,

16:48.296 --> 16:50.192
It was a preparation for this moment.

17:00.858 --> 17:02.775
The way you sing and play,

17:02.778 --> 17:04.608
It is one of the coolest things I've ever heard.

17:04.611 --> 17:06.358
I knew that Cee Lo Green is here.

17:06.361 --> 17:08.567
When you win and it's a chair, it will be like,

17:08.569 --> 17:11.566
no one will have to hear me again.

17:11.744 --> 17:14.926
Jesse and Taylor, like these guys, they are weird,

17:14.928 --> 17:18.513
and there is only one place for them in this battle.

17:18.515 --> 17:19.973
I want to introduce the guest,

17:19.973 --> 17:22.445
- Mr. John Legend.  - Dude, it's a pleasure to meet you.

17:22.446 --> 17:24.356
- surprise.  Surprise.  - I know.

17:24.357 --> 17:29.266
Of course, Adam is great, and John Legend as well.

17:29.267 --> 17:34.196
John Legend is a great inspiration for me

17:34.197 --> 17:35.826
in music and singing.

17:35.827 --> 17:38.355
I was impressed the most, I think, you know.

17:38.356 --> 17:41.190
I like this double because it makes no sense.

17:41.191 --> 17:43.452
- But I think it can work.  - Certainly.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.830
I think you also harmonize very well.

17:51.163 --> 17:53.051
Eu dei a Jesse e Taylor, "Shameless",

17:53.086 --> 17:55.620
which is a version of Garth Brooks from the Billy Joel song,

17:55.621 --> 17:58.584
in which I think is a good way to join these two,

17:58.585 --> 18:01.227
Jesse can dive in the aspects of Billy Joel

18:01.228 --> 18:04.307
and Taylor can dive in the aspects of Garth Brooks.

18:05.451 --> 18:08.346
The song we're singing, it's one of my favorites.

18:08.347 --> 18:10.384
I remember listening to her as a child.

18:10.385 --> 18:12.474
My parents played the disc Garth Brooks direct.

18:12.515 --> 18:13.815
I have everything he's ever done,

18:13.816 --> 18:16.711
I'm excited to sing one of his songs.

18:16.712 --> 18:19.555
His accent is everything there.

18:20.178 --> 18:24.130
But it seems that it makes you cut

18:24.131 --> 18:26.211
the end of a few words.

18:26.212 --> 18:27.540
It's all right.  Nice.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.006
Would like you to pull more air before,

18:30.007 --> 18:32.193
then we can hear the note longer.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.625
- Of course.  - Use the.  Do not hide.

18:34.626 --> 18:35.993
- Is ready?  - Yes.

18:35.994 --> 18:38.264
I had never heard the song until yesterday.

18:38.265 --> 18:40.187
So it's cool.  Well, all right.

18:41.727 --> 18:43.874
I was a little nervous and scared,

18:43.875 --> 18:47.330
I think this song was made for people like Taylor.

18:48.984 --> 18:52.299
It will be a big challenge for me.

18:53.218 --> 18:54.543
I liked their vibrato.

18:54.544 --> 18:56.220
Thanks man.  I learned with you.

18:57.319 --> 18:59.818
- I will not lie.  - So really I enjoyed it.

19:00.043 --> 19:02.990
I love the weird and wonderful nature of this duet.

19:03.749 --> 19:06.178
Why I love this program because it is wild.

19:06.523 --> 19:08.474
Jesse, you can sing anything,

19:08.475 --> 19:10.081
but do not take it too well.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.074
Learn the melody and turn away from it ...

19:12.075 --> 19:13.951
once you know the main base.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.659
I do not want to compete with each other,

19:15.660 --> 19:17.155
why Jesse, you are powerful.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.242
For you, this will be something big.

19:19.243 --> 19:22.912
Just do the best you can, and it will speak for itself.

19:22.913 --> 19:25.079
And it will be a very big if at the last moment,

19:25.080 --> 19:28.351
you have the coordination and harmonies together.

19:28.352 --> 19:29.982
- It will be really cool.  - Yeah, man.

19:29.983 --> 19:32.991
For tomorrow, I want to see how they came up with a plan,

19:32.992 --> 19:35.996
knowing the notes will do and raze.

19:44.962 --> 19:46.810
- That's right!  - All right!

19:46.811 --> 19:50.246
Taylor, I think you had trouble in the second pass.

19:50.247 --> 19:51.678
It was a little below the tone.

19:51.679 --> 19:54.427
I'm just on top of my reach.

19:54.428 --> 19:58.012
I know how it is, because this is the top of my power too, so ...

19:58.247 --> 20:01.194
Let alone to do when in harmony.

20:01.195 --> 20:03.775
And his grave, sounds great.

20:03.776 --> 20:06.432
There was a point there, then work in this area.

20:06.433 --> 20:09.260
A typical below the top, that's where you should sing!

20:09.495 --> 20:12.122
Jesse, at first, seems to be very close

20:12.123 --> 20:13.463
microphone and is stuffy.

20:13.464 --> 20:15.931
You have to move away not to disrupt the pronunciation.

20:15.932 --> 20:17.646
I think we should use the instruments.

20:17.647 --> 20:19.172
Because for me, it creates a sound

20:19.173 --> 20:22.594
a little less stoic, perhaps a  vibe  more youthful.

20:22.595 --> 20:25.236
So grab your guns and let's smashing!

20:26.631 --> 20:29.158
Taylor has a voice  country  very sincere,

20:29.159 --> 20:30.615
and I love that about him.

20:30.616 --> 20:32.261
Jesse is a very powerful singer,

20:32.262 --> 20:34.464
and I think this will be a great advantage.

20:34.465 --> 20:37.608
You never know what will happen in these things.

20:37.609 --> 20:39.911
- That!  - Yes.

20:39.912 --> 20:41.650
- came to life.  - Yes.

20:41.651 --> 20:44.151
@GrupoSubVoice

20:44.152 --> 20:46.660
GrupoSubVoice.wordpress.com fb.com/GrupoSubVoice

20:50.255 --> 20:52.184
We're back with the battles.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.733
It is very difficult to pay the bills just playing music,

20:56.734 --> 20:59.520
and often I have to get odd jobs,

20:59.521 --> 21:01.546
so this is a lifetime opportunity.

21:01.547 --> 21:03.082
I need to win this battle.

21:03.083 --> 21:06.859
Taylor Alexander ...

21:08.797 --> 21:11.140
contra Jesse Larson!

21:11.141 --> 21:13.068
I struggled a lot to get here,

21:13.069 --> 21:15.951
and I had the opportunity to work

21:15.952 --> 21:18.039
as very talented people,

21:18.040 --> 21:20.031
I'm not ready to give up yet.

21:21.369 --> 21:24.209
The battle begins now.

21:32.924 --> 21:35.601
Well I'm shameless

21:35.860 --> 21:38.825
When it comes to lovin' you

21:38.860 --> 21:41.554
I'll do anything you want me to

21:42.082 --> 21:45.115
I'll do anything at all

21:45.985 --> 21:48.180
And I'm standin'

21:49.091 --> 21:52.043
In another world to see

21:52.078 --> 21:55.107
Oh, baby, that's what's left of me

21:55.142 --> 21:58.267
I don't have very far to fall

21:59.160 --> 22:01.204
You know now I'm not a man

22:01.239 --> 22:02.704
That's ever been

22:02.739 --> 22:06.086
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in

22:06.193 --> 22:07.906
I don't break easy

22:07.941 --> 22:09.593
I have my pride

22:09.628 --> 22:12.681
But if you need to be satisfied

22:12.682 --> 22:15.016
Well, I'm shameless

22:15.318 --> 22:18.289
Well, honey, I don't have a prayer

22:18.360 --> 22:20.966
Every time I see you standin' there

22:21.401 --> 22:25.526
Well, I go down upon my knees

22:25.735 --> 22:27.822
And I'm changin'

22:28.485 --> 22:31.406
Swore I'd never compromise

22:31.441 --> 22:34.688
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise

22:34.723 --> 22:37.930
I'll do anything you please

22:38.738 --> 22:40.533
You know it should be easy

22:40.534 --> 22:42.494
For a man who's strong

22:42.529 --> 22:45.901
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong

22:45.902 --> 22:48.846
I've never lost anything I've ever missed

22:48.968 --> 22:54.329
But I've never been in love like this

22:54.364 --> 22:56.811
God, it's out of my hands

22:56.846 --> 22:59.202
Well, I'm shameless

22:59.758 --> 23:02.588
I don't have the power now

23:02.901 --> 23:05.147
And I don't need it anyhow

23:05.860 --> 23:09.283
So I got to let it go

23:09.699 --> 23:11.949
Well, I'm shameless

23:12.672 --> 23:16.095
As shameless as a man can be

23:16.105 --> 23:18.819
Can make a total fool of me

23:18.943 --> 23:23.193
I just wanted you to know

23:23.228 --> 23:32.305
Well, I'm shameless

23:32.443 --> 23:35.551
I'm down on my knees

23:36.318 --> 23:45.137
I'm shameless

23:45.318 --> 23:49.241
Well, I just wanted you to know

23:49.276 --> 23:52.168
Well, I'm shameless

23:54.276 --> 23:56.835
Applause for Jesse e Taylor!

24:04.610 --> 24:07.672
- Blake, you have the floor.  - Great presentation of both.

24:08.151 --> 24:10.085
I think Taylor probably had

24:10.186 --> 24:11.817
more work with the music.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.619
But, man, you showed it came.

24:13.951 --> 24:16.206
Jesse, it gave you chance

24:16.241 --> 24:19.007
of having to exceed expectations.

24:19.026 --> 24:21.251
Because if it will raise the level,

24:21.252 --> 24:22.952
then you have to take a step forward.

24:22.953 --> 24:25.562
That's what I noticed in the battle.  So it was that good.

24:25.563 --> 24:27.805
But I have to keep my  cowboy  here.

24:27.806 --> 24:30.020
I am impressed with how much Taylor shone.

24:30.021 --> 24:31.591
Thanks, Blake.  Alicia?

24:32.985 --> 24:35.110
Taylor, there were times you stood

24:35.111 --> 24:37.070
and I liked that, you went deep.

24:37.105 --> 24:40.420
And Jesse, I think your voice has a unique timbre.

24:40.455 --> 24:42.210
It creates its own world.

24:42.245 --> 24:45.081
So I'm anxious to see who the Adam choose.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.210
Thank you, mentor.  Gwen Stefani?

24:49.211 --> 24:50.913
Beautiful way to not choose anyone.

24:51.244 --> 24:53.347
Smartass!  He looked sneak.

24:53.739 --> 24:55.634
Both of you have personality.

24:55.693 --> 24:57.340
It is very clear who you are.

24:57.443 --> 25:00.323
What I love about you is that your look is unforgettable.

25:00.485 --> 25:03.188
You seem a perfect  cowboy .

25:04.819 --> 25:07.268
Jesse, clearly you are super talented

25:07.303 --> 25:09.127
and you can do everything with your voice.

25:09.162 --> 25:11.512
If you wanted to, could shake the structures.

25:11.547 --> 25:13.597
I loved had a dynamic in his voice.

25:13.632 --> 25:16.054
So you: "By the way ..."

25:16.904 --> 25:19.313
"This. I also know how to make guitar solo!"

25:19.314 --> 25:20.700
That's what I'm talking about.

25:21.071 --> 25:23.439
I would go with Jesse, more for their spirit

25:23.474 --> 25:25.488
- it was fun to watch.  - Thank you.

25:25.523 --> 25:26.896
Thank you, Gwen.

25:26.931 --> 25:28.830
Adam, the final decision is yours, of course.

25:28.904 --> 25:30.204
They both turned 1 chair,

25:30.239 --> 25:31.857
and I am immensely proud that

25:31.860 --> 25:33.615
because I believe I saw something in you

25:33.616 --> 25:35.958
that no one else saw, and do not want it to end.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.792
Taylor, you impressed me today.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.867
And I remember you trying to compete a bit with Jesse.

25:40.868 --> 25:43.816
I said, "No, do not do it, do it your way.

25:43.831 --> 25:46.485
You did just that, it was an amazing job.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.499
Jesse, you are really talented,

25:48.534 --> 25:51.285
and through music that flows from you effortlessly.

25:51.541 --> 25:53.454
People who are doing well in this program,

25:53.455 --> 25:56.742
They are those who share their joy

25:56.777 --> 25:58.626
in making music with the world.

25:58.627 --> 25:59.980
That's what you did.

25:59.982 --> 26:01.775
I am very proud of you, thank you.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.497
- Thanks dude.  - Thank you.

26:05.250 --> 26:06.989
That was beautiful, Adam.

26:07.247 --> 26:09.134
Adam, who is the winner of the battle?

26:16.755 --> 26:18.088
The winner...

26:21.122 --> 26:23.600
The winner of this battle ...

26:26.249 --> 26:28.391
- is Jesse.  - Jesse, congratulations.

26:28.392 --> 26:29.820
You advance to the knockouts.

26:30.387 --> 26:32.762
I'm super happy to follow in Adam Team.

26:33.118 --> 26:35.969
I'm opening the mind to other genres, styles.

26:36.004 --> 26:37.662
It's a dream come true.

26:38.549 --> 26:40.691
Taylor, like to say something to your mentor?

26:41.187 --> 26:43.427
Thank you very much.  I learned a lot with you.

26:43.428 --> 26:45.701
- I appreciate the opportunity.  - Wonder.

26:45.702 --> 26:47.011
I'm glad for it.

26:47.012 --> 26:49.996
Ladies and gentlemen, applause for Taylor Alexander!

26:50.031 --> 26:52.154
- You did an amazing job.  - Thank you.

26:52.189 --> 26:54.272
You did everything he needed to do, man.

26:54.307 --> 26:55.900
You are a better singer now.

26:55.935 --> 26:57.596
Taylor really did their homework,

26:57.631 --> 26:59.258
but I think Jesse is one of

26:59.283 --> 27:02.231
most interesting singers, dynamic and unique program.

27:02.266 --> 27:05.393
He came and destroyed everything.  Beware Jesse.

27:05.394 --> 27:07.395
It can be one of the strongest singers.

27:07.396 --> 27:09.155
- Jesse?  Certainly.  - Yes.

27:09.190 --> 27:11.564
Why I do not believe when I did not turn him.

27:11.599 --> 27:13.463
This guy is just like the Sundance.

27:13.498 --> 27:15.379
Yes, it's the same.  - Watch it.

27:15.414 --> 27:17.461
- He is very good.  - It will surprise!

27:21.809 --> 27:25.626
You can purchase today's music on iTunes ...

27:27.616 --> 27:29.757
Or hear them in the Apple Music.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.049
To follow...

27:32.050 --> 27:33.661
Look at him.  Turn around.

27:33.696 --> 27:35.171
Come to me now.

27:40.266 --> 27:41.671
I was like, "Damn."

27:41.706 --> 27:43.802
Almost finished with Gwen for you.

27:43.837 --> 27:47.511
It was very elegant, but with a touch obscene.

27:47.512 --> 27:49.563
Much that you say is so strange.

27:49.689 --> 27:52.190
Group Sub Voice features ...

27:52.191 --> 27:56.200
Butchers making the best rolls!

27:56.514 --> 27:58.409
Welcome back to the battle.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.894
Now we know the final battle Team Gwen.

28:02.799 --> 28:06.037
Brandon Royal, 31 anos, de Orlando, Florida,

28:06.072 --> 28:09.850
contra, Davina Leone, 23 anos, de Miami, Florida.

28:11.053 --> 28:12.949
My God!  Is Cline Dion!

28:12.984 --> 28:16.396
Hi!  My God!  When I saw Cline Dion,

28:16.431 --> 28:19.592
I immediately thought, "This is not real."  Where's my alarm clock?

28:19.627 --> 28:21.611
- Let's talk in French!  - Yes Yes.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.778
- How are you doing?  - Good and you?

28:23.813 --> 28:25.932
that too.  I'm glad to meet you.

28:25.967 --> 28:27.434
- Me too.  - I am delighted.

28:27.615 --> 28:29.299
I am delighted too.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.826
My family is French, and when I was younger,

28:31.827 --> 28:33.548
I was the American girl at school,

28:33.583 --> 28:35.201
but at home, we spoke French.

28:35.236 --> 28:37.062
It was like a double life.

28:37.453 --> 28:39.533
I started posting videos on YouTube.

28:39.568 --> 28:41.851
Have 37 thousand subscribers,

28:42.058 --> 28:44.237
with 5 million hits on my channel,

28:44.422 --> 28:47.501
but The Voice is a great opportunity.

28:52.045 --> 28:55.330
You are great and has lots of personality.

28:55.332 --> 28:57.960
- Thank you!  - Welcome to the Team Gwen!

28:59.344 --> 29:01.795
I grew up in the US Virgin Islands, and so

29:01.800 --> 29:05.915
I try to incorporate Calypso, Soca and Reggae music I do.

29:05.919 --> 29:09.836
But I am firefighter for nearly two years, to pay the bills.

29:18.798 --> 29:21.524
I started this musical style called  Ska .

29:21.527 --> 29:26.265
With time, I worked with Dr. Dre, Eve and even hip hop,

29:26.280 --> 29:28.849
and feel different styles present in you.

29:28.963 --> 29:31.319
Brandon, I want to help raise your hose.

29:32.327 --> 29:34.667
Enough!  Who do you choose?

29:34.686 --> 29:36.802
I choose ... Gwen!

29:38.139 --> 29:40.771
Essa msica, "In the Night", do The Weeknd,

29:40.780 --> 29:44.975
is good for you, Brandon, do something repeated.

29:44.979 --> 29:46.502
- Yeah. - It's more modern,

29:46.505 --> 29:49.300
that people can see you do, as for you,

29:49.303 --> 29:51.657
Davina, is the pop world you want to be part of.

29:51.866 --> 29:54.517
So I think it fits for you two.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.654
Davina is great!  Great singer, great talent.

30:04.281 --> 30:08.055
I was suffering from some acute, and she had the advantage.

30:13.342 --> 30:15.784
Oh my God!

30:16.070 --> 30:19.427
- I'm tearing up now.  - This song, to a guy ...

30:19.574 --> 30:24.687
It's too high!  You did well, but I feel you choking.

30:25.161 --> 30:27.569
Your vocal cords are vibrating too.

30:28.181 --> 30:31.637
Make a move, swallow saliva and move on.

30:31.772 --> 30:34.215
- Just free your energy.  - Thank you, Queen.

30:34.219 --> 30:37.070
And it is not only the voice.  We have to work

30:37.074 --> 30:40.466
- facial and body expression ... - Yes.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.072
- Make your way.  - It's ok.

30:42.076 --> 30:44.937
And Davina, you have something that I love in her voice and no one

30:44.941 --> 30:47.578
can learn, is the style in his voice,

30:47.582 --> 30:50.952
I think a lot like mine.

30:50.955 --> 30:54.014
When you come after him, you have to open a little more,

30:54.017 --> 30:55.353
something like...

30:57.562 --> 31:00.217
- You know, smooth.  - Very soft.

31:00.597 --> 31:03.427
- Even slow, it has attitude.  - Got it.

31:05.281 --> 31:08.232
Is he going to make that note, I'm saying it will!

31:09.121 --> 31:14.371
Today was fun, but when you have to be serious, have to be.

31:14.374 --> 31:16.951
I think tomorrow will be very different.

31:28.667 --> 31:31.455
- We come to another level!  - Look, Davina ...

31:31.474 --> 31:34.647
Yesterday, my suggestion was to give maneirada,

31:34.913 --> 31:37.985
and you did it very well.  It was fantastic.

31:38.175 --> 31:39.874
- Thanks.  - You have to have one more

31:39.879 --> 31:42.252
a little confidence.  I see you starting well,

31:42.259 --> 31:45.272
but then you end up shaking the base, unsure.

31:45.479 --> 31:46.895
- It can not!  - It's ok.

31:46.962 --> 31:48.983
You are telling a story, you know?

31:52.232 --> 31:54.772
It facial expression should be made.

31:54.773 --> 31:56.073
Do it!

31:56.074 --> 31:58.339
Show what you mean.

31:58.340 --> 31:59.972
- How old is?  - I'm 23.

31:59.973 --> 32:01.424
Okay, now you have 40.

32:03.473 --> 32:06.388
She is very young and is embarrassed to go after him.

32:06.389 --> 32:08.753
So it is contained and I said,

32:08.754 --> 32:11.523
"Do not do the little girl, because this is not the kind of song

32:11.524 --> 32:13.434
you should be ashamed. "

32:13.435 --> 32:14.735
I would like ...

32:18.993 --> 32:21.667
Let the letter dominate your body a little more.

32:21.668 --> 32:23.546
I will not bow your head for you.

32:23.547 --> 32:25.566
- It's all right.  - It's a little personal.

32:25.567 --> 32:28.281
I was like, "I have to record what she says,

32:28.282 --> 32:29.582
because it's so valuable. "

32:30.446 --> 32:32.228
Look at it and turn.

32:32.229 --> 32:33.529
You come to me now.

32:33.530 --> 32:35.829
You come to me.

32:37.657 --> 32:39.645
Scroll to the bottom.

32:39.646 --> 32:43.716
I was like, "wow, this is Cline Dion,

32:43.717 --> 32:45.349
and she's touching me. "

32:46.435 --> 32:50.146
Never again will wash this sweater and this blouse.

32:50.147 --> 32:51.764
Holy crap, man!

32:53.839 --> 32:56.341
Davina made great progress,

32:56.342 --> 32:58.735
but Brandon has strong instinct.

32:58.736 --> 33:02.241
What will decide who is convince me

33:02.242 --> 33:04.533
- that is their song.  - Amazing.

33:06.591 --> 33:08.149
It is the night of the battle.

33:08.150 --> 33:10.844
Brandon and Davina arrive on stage.

33:11.887 --> 33:15.805
It is a proud moment to see you after so much work.

33:15.806 --> 33:18.329
Keep their personalities and not think too much.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.481
That's what people look for someone with personality.

33:21.482 --> 33:24.126
- Someone has to be stolen.  - Right.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.427
Today is the day.

33:31.348 --> 33:33.373
We're back with the battles.

33:33.374 --> 33:35.569
They are good, love this battle.

33:35.570 --> 33:37.715
- You still have Stealing?  - Yes.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.848
- it is the last, right?  - Yes.

33:43.024 --> 33:45.194
- That legal!  - Brandon Royal

33:45.195 --> 33:47.945
contra Davina Leone.

33:49.297 --> 33:51.370
This battle begins now.

33:58.456 --> 34:00.774
All alone she was living

34:01.261 --> 34:04.941
In a world without an end or beginning

34:05.652 --> 34:09.413
Babygirl was living life for the feeling

34:09.414 --> 34:13.980
I don't mind, I don't mind

34:15.500 --> 34:18.054
And all the wrongs she committed

34:18.054 --> 34:22.322
She was numb and she was so co-dependent

34:22.915 --> 34:26.672
She was young and all she had was the city

34:26.913 --> 34:31.422
But I don't mind, I don't mind

34:31.456 --> 34:33.926
I know

34:33.983 --> 34:38.217
That she's capable of anything

34:38.217 --> 34:40.149
It's riveting

34:40.184 --> 34:42.154
But when

34:42.340 --> 34:49.839
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

34:49.873 --> 34:54.061
In the night she hears him calling

34:54.201 --> 35:00.991
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain

35:01.026 --> 35:04.303
She'll never walk away

35:04.304 --> 35:07.514
I don't think you understand

35:08.972 --> 35:12.114
He sang a song when he did it

35:12.149 --> 35:15.878
He was cold and he was so unforgiving

35:16.120 --> 35:20.207
Now she dances to the song on the minute

35:20.854 --> 35:22.931
- All the time - All the time

35:22.932 --> 35:25.100
All the time

35:25.101 --> 35:27.679
But when

35:27.714 --> 35:34.992
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

35:35.027 --> 35:39.090
In the night she hears him calling

35:39.293 --> 35:45.293
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain

35:45.818 --> 35:49.285
She'll never walk away

35:49.286 --> 35:52.023
I don't think you understand

35:52.024 --> 35:56.131
In the night when she comes crawling

35:56.504 --> 36:02.440
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face

36:03.063 --> 36:08.206
She'll never walk away

36:08.618 --> 36:12.215
I don't think you understand

36:13.380 --> 36:15.326
Applause for Brandon e Davina,

36:15.327 --> 36:17.178
battle in the Team Gwen.

36:20.104 --> 36:23.096
Good work from you.  Adam, you get.

36:23.097 --> 36:26.153
Brandon, you are amazing.

36:26.154 --> 36:27.587
You are very good.

36:27.588 --> 36:29.615
Davina, I was like, "damn!"

36:29.616 --> 36:32.825
You're part of it as anyone else.

36:32.826 --> 36:35.319
Was very good.  We had a good chemistry.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.333
I loved that feeling.  Like "wow!"

36:38.334 --> 36:40.774
There were many good parts in the presentation.

36:40.775 --> 36:42.075
Is very difficult.

36:42.076 --> 36:43.376
Thank you, Adam.  Blake?

36:43.492 --> 36:46.217
They gave 110% of himself.

36:46.218 --> 36:49.386
For me, Davina came out of nowhere!

36:49.387 --> 36:50.687
You just turned 1 chair,

36:50.688 --> 36:54.678
but with this presentation I would have turned the 4!

36:54.679 --> 36:58.767
Brandon, you had one of my favorite auditions.

36:58.768 --> 37:00.960
Almost finished with Gwen for you.

37:01.927 --> 37:03.473
We both turned to you,

37:03.474 --> 37:07.370
and I thought "this guy is amazing!"

37:07.371 --> 37:09.166
Now, I feel it even more.

37:09.167 --> 37:12.728
His voice comes to life in this highest record,

37:12.729 --> 37:14.029
is awesome, man.

37:14.030 --> 37:17.656
I could go up there to hug him and kiss him now!

37:18.805 --> 37:21.154
I would pick Brandon, I am a fan!

37:21.155 --> 37:23.395
They had so many strange things about what you said!

37:23.396 --> 37:25.832
I want his albums and I hugs.

37:25.833 --> 37:27.603
I get it, but it was the way they spoke.

37:27.604 --> 37:29.805
I'll get a hug to the end of the season.

37:30.979 --> 37:33.063
Thanks, Blake.  Alicia?

37:33.064 --> 37:35.062
I loved the music chosen!

37:35.063 --> 37:37.933
I felt his energy in Davina,

37:37.934 --> 37:41.626
type battleing with the homies and staring.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.910
Feel it in you, you know.

37:44.475 --> 37:48.457
Brandon, her vocal control is spectacular.

37:48.458 --> 37:50.909
I loved the way you perform well.

37:50.910 --> 37:54.731
Very elegant, but with a touch obscene.

37:54.732 --> 37:56.290
 "elegantesceno".

37:56.761 --> 37:59.277
- Obscene and elegant.  - That's it.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.929
Why no one complains when you say something strange?

38:02.881 --> 38:04.532
Why  sexy  coming from a woman.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.884
- Obscene and elegant?  - you have to be in place by.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.185
I just want a hug.

38:09.132 --> 38:11.659
Gwen, the decision is yours.  But before comment.

38:11.844 --> 38:15.517
It's so amazing to follow the development in the program.

38:15.768 --> 38:18.479
Davina, what impresses me most about you

38:18.480 --> 38:19.991
is your courage.

38:19.992 --> 38:22.490
Cline was choreographing, like ...

38:22.491 --> 38:25.193
Pointing finger and tals.

38:25.194 --> 38:29.827
And today I saw it on stage, you absorbed the advice.

38:29.828 --> 38:31.441
I was impressed with it.

38:32.123 --> 38:36.260
Brandon, it was nice to get you out of that business Stevie Wonder,

38:36.261 --> 38:39.519
and put it in the pop, which might make a record.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.399
And sing a refrain so acute, so easily,

38:43.400 --> 38:47.452
but also almost crying with emotion.

38:47.453 --> 38:50.610
I'm proud.  He worked the stage, natural.

38:50.611 --> 38:52.593
Gwen, who won this battle?

38:52.594 --> 38:54.795
I loved to know them.

38:55.698 --> 38:58.602
Both are very talented, hard to decide.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.375
So the winner of this battle ...

39:04.771 --> 39:06.331
It's Brandon.

39:07.922 --> 39:11.820
Brandon Royal ranks for knockouts, congratulations!

39:13.822 --> 39:16.032
Brandon does not need to work,

39:16.033 --> 39:18.921
excited to see what songs he can sing.

39:18.922 --> 39:21.616
And happy to keep him away from Blake,

39:21.617 --> 39:24.871
for he is such a fan that it's ...

39:24.872 --> 39:26.172
Weird.

39:26.173 --> 39:27.509
Congratulations.  Come here!

39:27.729 --> 39:29.029
I really can?

39:29.227 --> 39:30.617
Go Go.

39:37.002 --> 39:40.558
What a crazy experience, an island guy like me

39:40.559 --> 39:43.429
going for knockouts, that madness!

39:43.763 --> 39:46.270
Mentors, Davina can be Stolen.

39:46.271 --> 39:48.636
Davina, something to tell your mentor?

39:48.637 --> 39:51.115
Thanks for the advice ...

39:51.116 --> 39:53.133
Blah blah blah.

39:53.134 --> 39:55.963
We have a theft!

39:57.599 --> 40:02.563
Adam Levine comes along and steals Davina Team Gwen!

40:02.564 --> 40:03.864
You're amazing, girl.

40:03.865 --> 40:05.671
You were so wonderful.

40:06.817 --> 40:11.525
A youtuber sensao de Miami continua no The Voice.

40:11.526 --> 40:14.839
The fact that you go home does not make sense to me.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.655
I was like "No, she will not."  And I pressed the button.

40:17.656 --> 40:21.783
Davina, congratulations and see us knockouts with Adam!

40:21.784 --> 40:23.709
Davina has a strong presence,

40:23.710 --> 40:26.238
her voice and her ease on stage

40:26.239 --> 40:27.539
They made me Steal it.

40:27.540 --> 40:28.895
It was all on time.

40:28.896 --> 40:31.105
- I leave proud!  - That's it!

40:32.080 --> 40:33.493
I am very grateful!

40:33.494 --> 40:36.504
I gave everything and struggled so much!

40:36.505 --> 40:38.091
I knew it was not the end!

40:38.092 --> 40:40.192
I have a lot to offer, much more!

40:40.745 --> 40:42.544
I love her style.

40:42.545 --> 40:44.705
That was amazing, thank you!

40:44.706 --> 40:46.311
Well done, man.

40:46.312 --> 40:48.468
Only to have several subscribers on  youtube ,

40:48.469 --> 40:51.562
to me when you can hit

40:51.563 --> 40:53.463
only putting their music  online ,

40:53.464 --> 40:54.764
this is relevant!

40:54.765 --> 40:56.065
Next week...

40:56.172 --> 40:58.770
Mentors send their teams to the ...

40:59.288 --> 41:00.791
Knockouts!

41:01.668 --> 41:04.883
It is the most competitive and crucial stage here!

41:04.884 --> 41:06.885
The artists choose the songs you can

41:06.886 --> 41:09.512
guarantee them the Classifiers.

41:09.513 --> 41:11.073
"When We Were Young" da Adele.

41:11.418 --> 41:13.147
You never take it easy.

41:13.339 --> 41:14.707
For the 1st time this season,

41:14.708 --> 41:18.268
artists have personal essays only with the mentor.

41:18.269 --> 41:20.122
I would like to do ...

41:24.990 --> 41:27.830
You have the chance to touch people with your feeling.

41:27.831 --> 41:30.909
You do not have to do too much, if it loses connection.

41:30.910 --> 41:33.028
And mentors increase pressure.

41:33.029 --> 41:34.380
That among the next victim!

41:34.381 --> 41:36.730
You will watch the opponent to the test.

41:37.046 --> 41:39.431
It will not be easy to pass this stage.

41:39.604 --> 41:41.693
Artists need to face the challenge.

41:41.694 --> 41:44.481
Do not let me down!

41:51.820 --> 41:54.663
Thank you God for letting me witness this!

41:54.664 --> 41:56.731
This was a presentation level Grammy.

41:58.294 --> 42:00.662
We have a theft!

42:01.289 --> 42:02.589
Galera, get ready,

42:02.590 --> 42:05.241
the fight for live programs begins next week!
