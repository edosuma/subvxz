00:00.284 --> 00:01.808
<i>Cynthia, this is Andrea,
a client.</i>

00:01.886 --> 00:03.786
<i>Andrea, this is Cynthia,
a friend of mine.</i>

00:03.854 --> 00:07.381
You didn't tell Rick that you had
proposed and Miss Farrell had accepted?

00:08.526 --> 00:11.154
Where's Andrea? You're
not staying here at all.

00:11.295 --> 00:13.855
I have to stay here
and you know why.

00:14.064 --> 00:16.862
<i>Believe us, it is not
a matter for the police.</i>

00:19.236 --> 00:21.534
Really want to stay
in the guest house?

00:21.605 --> 00:24.472
<i>Well, I'm not that worried
about the closet space.</i>

00:24.842 --> 00:28.005
<i>No, we got to get out of here!
Give me my keys.</i>

01:34.710 --> 01:36.507
<i>Yeah, I know
what you like, baby.</i>

01:36.611 --> 01:38.806
You like this?

01:38.880 --> 01:40.905
<i>Mmm-hmm.
Well, you're gonna love this.</i>

01:40.982 --> 01:42.313
I know I am.

01:42.384 --> 01:45.114
<i>How about this, right here?</i>

01:45.187 --> 01:47.883
<i>Ow! Hey, that really hurts. Take it easy.</i>

01:48.056 --> 01:50.081
Shut up and sit still.
Never mind.

01:50.158 --> 01:52.626
<i>Hey, I said cut it out.</i>

01:52.694 --> 01:54.662
<i>Be quiet,
I know you like it rough.</i>

02:00.836 --> 02:03.327
What the hell's
the matter with you?

02:06.675 --> 02:08.472
What's going on here?

02:08.977 --> 02:11.343
<i>You shouldn't have done that.
Oh, no!</i>

02:11.413 --> 02:12.778
<i>What's the matter with you, man?</i>

02:12.848 --> 02:13.872
<i>Cut it!</i>

02:13.949 --> 02:15.940
He's crazy!
Make him stop!

02:17.119 --> 02:18.711
I'm gonna slice you open!

02:18.787 --> 02:19.776
<i>Cut it!</i>

02:19.855 --> 02:21.550
<i>Hey, Claude, Andrea,
get back here!</i>

02:32.934 --> 02:35.562
<i>Is that it?
Afraid so, Mr. Nathan.</i>

02:38.774 --> 02:40.036
Find her.

02:40.375 --> 02:41.364
<i>Forget it, Danny.</i>

02:41.443 --> 02:43.673
She probably didn't stop running
till she got to the airport.

02:43.745 --> 02:45.042
She could be anywhere by now.

02:45.113 --> 02:47.343
I said find her.

02:52.621 --> 02:54.384
You've got 24 hours.

02:57.692 --> 02:59.717
<i>When you only have one day,</i>

03:00.262 --> 03:02.025
you don't want to
lose a second of it.

03:02.097 --> 03:04.691
You have to commit yourself

03:05.300 --> 03:07.393
to using every hour
to the best advantage.

03:07.469 --> 03:09.801
Even when
you're not exactly sure

03:09.871 --> 03:12.499
what it is
you're trying to accomplish.

03:13.141 --> 03:15.268
<i>Because without commitment,</i>

03:16.611 --> 03:19.102
<i>you can't get
the most out of a day,</i>

03:19.381 --> 03:22.043
or your job or a relationship.

03:24.286 --> 03:28.245
It's better to dive in and
make a totally wrong choice

03:28.323 --> 03:31.190
than not to make
any choice at all.

03:33.395 --> 03:35.625
You've gotta go for it.
Commit.

03:36.565 --> 03:39.159
Five!
Five films in one weekend.

03:39.534 --> 03:40.626
That's not that many.

03:40.702 --> 03:43.193
<i>No, it isn't, if you've
got nothing better to do.</i>

03:43.271 --> 03:45.000
What does that mean?

03:45.073 --> 03:47.473
These rentals are on me.

03:47.909 --> 03:50.434
They are? Why? I just
needed your membership card.

03:50.512 --> 03:52.241
I didn't expect you
to pick up the tab.

03:52.314 --> 03:56.011
<i>Well, I didn't expect you to spend
the whole weekend watching old movies.</i>

03:56.084 --> 03:59.281
But that's your business
and these are my treat.

03:59.354 --> 04:02.414
<i>Okay, you got Jaws, Lust
Weekend, Man-Crazy Madge...</i>

04:02.491 --> 04:04.516
<i>Thanks, T. C.,
that's a nice thing to do.</i>

04:04.593 --> 04:06.493
<i>And All the World's a Bed
and Airport. Anything else?</i>

04:06.561 --> 04:07.721
<i>No, that's everything.
Thanks again, T.C.</i>

04:07.796 --> 04:10.526
<i>Whoa! Hold it! Hold it!
Lust Weekend?</i>

04:11.032 --> 04:12.226
It's not what you think.

04:12.300 --> 04:13.927
<i>No, it's better than you think.</i>

04:14.002 --> 04:15.094
Give me my card.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.762
<i>Oh, but, T. C.,
you can't back out on me now.</i>

04:16.838 --> 04:18.930
This is the only place in town
I can get these titles.

04:19.007 --> 04:21.305
<i>The question is,
why would you even want them?</i>

04:21.375 --> 04:24.311
<i>Three X-rated movies? Sandwiched
in between Airport and Jaws?</i>

04:24.379 --> 04:26.973
I can explain later.
Am I ready to go?

04:27.048 --> 04:29.141
<i>If you're not ready to go
with these, you never will be.</i>

04:29.217 --> 04:30.650
Wait a minute.
Give me my card.

04:30.719 --> 04:32.016
I don't want these out
in my name.

04:32.087 --> 04:34.749
<i>No, T. C., I promised I'd pick
them up for someone. I need them.</i>

04:34.823 --> 04:39.851
Are you trying to tell me that the girl
you're marrying gets off on this kinda stuff?

04:40.195 --> 04:42.595
Marrying?
I'm not getting married.

04:42.664 --> 04:43.722
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

04:43.798 --> 04:47.325
<i>That mysterious friend that
Higgins says you're expecting today,</i>

04:47.402 --> 04:49.870
<i>the friend that you want
me to fly around the island,</i>

04:49.938 --> 04:51.496
<i>is just a friend, right?</i>

04:51.573 --> 04:53.473
<i>Exactly, just a friend.</i>

04:53.808 --> 04:58.006
<i>Thomas, Orville told us
the rest of the story.</i>

04:58.313 --> 04:59.473
<i>Hey, congratulations.</i>

04:59.548 --> 05:01.106
Orville didn't understand.

05:01.249 --> 05:03.274
<i>Oh, yes he did.
We all do.</i>

05:04.185 --> 05:07.120
But that's your secret
until you say the word.

05:07.188 --> 05:09.554
The word is "misunderstanding.
" And I'm not getting married.

05:09.624 --> 05:12.525
And I need these
and I've gotta go. Bye.

05:13.328 --> 05:15.023
Yeah. Hurry and change.

05:15.096 --> 05:18.429
Higgins says the future
Mrs. Magnum is due at noon.

05:21.303 --> 05:24.466
I'm sorry.
I was the last person off.

05:25.307 --> 05:27.434
There are no more
passengers on board.

05:27.509 --> 05:30.000
Maybe she took a later flight? Maybe.

05:30.545 --> 05:32.672
Sorry.
Thanks.

05:34.549 --> 05:37.848
<i>We're sorry. All mainland
circuits are busy at the moment.</i>

05:37.919 --> 05:39.887
<i>Please try
your call again later.</i>

05:39.955 --> 05:42.549
<i>We're sorry. All Mainland
circuits are busy...</i>

05:49.030 --> 05:51.965
I'm sorry. I just can't give
out that sort of information.

05:52.033 --> 05:54.763
<i>Well, then could you at least tell
me if she canceled her reservation,</i>

05:54.836 --> 05:56.064
took another flight?
No.

05:56.137 --> 05:58.765
Airline policy.
I really am sorry.

05:59.107 --> 06:00.199
Next.

06:04.512 --> 06:07.743
<i>We're sorry. The number you have
dialed is temporarily out of order.</i>

06:07.816 --> 06:10.011
<i>Would you please
try your call later?</i>

06:10.085 --> 06:11.245
<i>We're sorry.</i>

06:14.356 --> 06:15.414
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

06:15.490 --> 06:17.583
I presumed that you knew about
the problem with the telephones.

06:17.659 --> 06:20.025
<i>No, I didn't know! And
please don't say you're sorry.</i>

06:20.095 --> 06:21.790
Just tell me how long
the phones have been out.

06:21.863 --> 06:22.852
Since early this morning.

06:22.931 --> 06:24.899
Someone crashed into a pole
out on the highway.

06:24.966 --> 06:27.560
<i>However, I've been informed the
service will resume within the hour.</i>

06:27.636 --> 06:29.126
<i>Well, what about
the last six hours?</i>

06:29.237 --> 06:31.262
What if somebody's been trying
to call me here?

06:31.339 --> 06:34.502
<i>If you're referring
to your guest, she's arrived.</i>

06:34.576 --> 06:36.635
She's arrived? Here?

06:36.711 --> 06:38.906
Yes. I found her standing
outside the gate with her suitcase

06:38.980 --> 06:40.004
when I returned from shopping.

06:40.081 --> 06:41.070
<i>Higgins...
I must say,</i>

06:41.149 --> 06:43.549
I found her choice of
traveling attire somewhat odd.

06:43.618 --> 06:44.607
Higgins.

06:44.686 --> 06:46.210
<i>Like you, she was vague
about her identity,</i>

06:46.287 --> 06:48.721
simply explaining that
she was a friend.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.257
Where is she?

06:50.392 --> 06:51.882
In your living room.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.428
<i>I told her a room had been
prepared for her in the main house,</i>

06:54.496 --> 06:57.693
but she insisted on
waiting for you in the guest

07:01.069 --> 07:02.297
house.

07:03.872 --> 07:05.464
<i>Take this.</i>

07:05.640 --> 07:07.164
<i>Yeah. Ooh!</i>

07:07.242 --> 07:09.540
Andrea?
What are you doing here?

07:09.778 --> 07:12.747
I'm sorry. But we have to
look at these films right now.

07:12.814 --> 07:15.112
<i>No, we don't! We'll look at
them tomorrow, as planned.</i>

07:15.183 --> 07:17.981
<i>Thomas, Danny's goons broke
into my place this morning.</i>

07:20.455 --> 07:21.615
It's working.

07:21.690 --> 07:22.714
Hello?

07:22.791 --> 07:24.759
I barely managed to escape
through the back door.

07:24.826 --> 07:25.815
<i>Hello.</i>

07:25.894 --> 07:28.590
<i>We're sorry that your telephone
service has been interrupted</i>

07:28.663 --> 07:29.857
<i>but Oahu Pacific is...</i>

07:29.931 --> 07:31.762
<i>That's why I had no choice
but to come here,</i>

07:31.833 --> 07:33.391
and why I have to stay
for a couple of days.

07:33.468 --> 07:37.165
What? No! You can't stay
here. I'm expecting a guest.

07:37.772 --> 07:39.763
Yes. I know. Your fiancée.

07:40.108 --> 07:41.803
"Congratulations to
the happy couple."

07:41.876 --> 07:43.969
"Your secret's safe. Rick."

07:44.145 --> 07:46.340
<i>Thomas, I'm sorry, but please.</i>

07:46.681 --> 07:47.773
I'll stay out of your way.

07:47.849 --> 07:50.647
No! And she's not my fiancée.
She's just a friend.

07:50.719 --> 07:52.653
<i>But she's a good friend,
so just leave.</i>

07:52.721 --> 07:54.279
Tomorrow we'll start
looking for proof

07:54.355 --> 07:56.653
that girls get hurt
in Danny's films...

07:56.725 --> 07:59.819
But they don't just get hurt.
They get murdered.

08:00.795 --> 08:02.820
What? Snuff films?

08:03.164 --> 08:05.325
You're telling me
people actually make those?

08:05.400 --> 08:09.393
Danny. And that's exactly what he
had planned for me on the beach.

08:10.138 --> 08:12.800
I don't see people getting
killed in this film.

08:12.907 --> 08:16.604
<i>No, not yet. The girl always
dies at the end of the picture.</i>

08:16.978 --> 08:19.538
And Danny knows
that I know all about it.

08:19.614 --> 08:21.309
And he must have found out
that I hired you.

08:21.382 --> 08:23.179
<i>You like it?</i>

08:23.251 --> 08:24.684
<i>The films,
you didn't tell anybody</i>

08:24.753 --> 08:26.243
<i>why you were renting them,
did you?</i>

08:26.321 --> 08:27.310
<i>No, I didn't!</i>

08:27.388 --> 08:30.516
And why didn't you tell me about
them before you asked me to get them?

08:30.592 --> 08:32.116
Does it matter now?

08:32.193 --> 08:34.753
Danny is trying to kill me
to shut me up.

08:34.828 --> 08:37.525
So would you please
just watch the films with me

08:37.599 --> 08:41.034
<i>until I can find something I
recognize, some tie-in to him?</i>

08:42.337 --> 08:43.395
No! Don't! Cut it out!

08:43.471 --> 08:45.666
<i>Magnum.
That's nice.</i>

08:45.740 --> 08:49.198
<i>What in Heaven's name
is going on? More, more!</i>

08:50.879 --> 08:52.540
<i>Hit you. Yeah.</i>

08:52.614 --> 08:53.945
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

08:56.084 --> 08:57.244
<i>Hello.
Hello?</i>

08:57.318 --> 08:59.650
<i>Thank you for calling Pacific
International Airlines.</i>

08:59.721 --> 09:02.212
<i>We're sorry, but all of our
agents are busy at the moment...</i>

09:02.757 --> 09:04.156
<i>Magnum,
I'm sorry to interrupt...</i>

09:04.225 --> 09:06.750
<i>No, you're not sorry!
Nobody's sorry but me.</i>

09:06.828 --> 09:08.056
And I'm just sorry
that I blew it.

09:08.129 --> 09:09.391
I should have stayed
at the airport.

09:09.464 --> 09:11.125
Perhaps.
But it doesn't matter now.

09:11.199 --> 09:14.635
I came to tell you that yet
another friend has arrived.

09:16.437 --> 09:17.461
Hi.

09:19.574 --> 09:22.270
I was a little late
so I took a cab.

09:22.811 --> 09:23.971
Sorry.

09:29.099 --> 09:33.763
I always feel cheated when I fly to the
east coast. Because you lose five hours.

09:33.837 --> 09:37.773
<i>Oh, I know, I know, you
gain them when you fly back.</i>

09:38.441 --> 09:40.341
But somehow
that's not fair because

09:40.410 --> 09:44.005
I never seem to make use
of the hours that I gain.

09:44.080 --> 09:48.676
But I always feel that I would've
made use of the hours that I lost.

09:49.786 --> 09:52.118
<i>So, maybe that's the right idea.</i>

09:54.357 --> 09:58.589
Use the hours you know
you're gonna get in advance.

09:58.662 --> 10:00.562
<i>I mean, if you know
you're gonna get two hours</i>

10:00.630 --> 10:02.393
and you've got a useful purpose

10:02.465 --> 10:06.094
<i>in using three hours
before you leave, use them.</i>

10:06.603 --> 10:10.061
<i>And then you've only lost
one hour on the clock, right?</i>

10:10.574 --> 10:12.872
That should work mathematically.

10:14.411 --> 10:19.314
But why would one very
important 24-hour period

10:20.450 --> 10:24.511
still become
a 21-hour period?

10:25.989 --> 10:28.082
Which brings us back to
the question of commitment.

10:28.158 --> 10:30.626
<i>I mean, if you really wanted to
be over here in the first place,</i>

10:30.694 --> 10:32.457
<i>if you really wanted to,</i>

10:32.529 --> 10:37.262
why not just jump on a plane and
come over and get two extra hours?

10:38.101 --> 10:40.763
<i>I don't know,
maybe I'm being presumptuous.</i>

10:41.037 --> 10:44.234
<i>Yeah, but a free roundtrip
ticket to anywhere they fly?</i>

10:44.307 --> 10:46.241
<i>I mean, just for taking
a three-hour bump?</i>

10:46.309 --> 10:47.435
But I wouldn't have done it

10:47.510 --> 10:49.774
if I'd known I wasn't going
to be able to reach you.

10:49.846 --> 10:51.438
No. That's okay.

10:54.818 --> 10:56.718
Great to see you again.

10:57.153 --> 10:59.383
<i>Yeah. You, too. Thanks.</i>

11:01.057 --> 11:02.217
May I inquire

11:02.292 --> 11:05.420
as to which young lady will
be staying in the main house

11:05.495 --> 11:08.692
and which will be staying
elsewhere?

11:09.299 --> 11:12.166
No one is staying elsewhere.

11:12.569 --> 11:14.969
<i>Well, I'll be staying here,
right?</i>

11:15.038 --> 11:16.972
Here? Here?

11:19.542 --> 11:21.271
In the guest house?

11:22.445 --> 11:24.538
<i>Well, I guess... Yeah,
you could if you wanted to.</i>

11:24.614 --> 11:26.912
<i>Oh, you didn't plan for me to...</i>

11:27.751 --> 11:29.981
Wait. You must be his...

11:30.153 --> 11:31.347
Friend.

11:32.622 --> 11:35.022
Cynthia... Higgins...
Cynthia...

11:38.995 --> 11:42.726
Cynthia is the friend that I
mentioned. Andrea is the client.

11:42.966 --> 11:44.627
<i>Cynthia, this is Andrea,
a client.</i>

11:44.701 --> 11:47.499
<i>Andrea, this is Cynthia,
a friend of mine.</i>

11:47.604 --> 11:49.037
Hi. Hi.

11:49.739 --> 11:52.867
<i>Look, I don't mind staying in the
other house, so long as Thomas is...</i>

11:52.942 --> 11:55.035
You're not staying here at all!

11:55.111 --> 11:56.135
And you know that.

11:56.212 --> 11:58.942
But I have to stay here
and you know why.

12:01.284 --> 12:04.378
Will anyone be using the room
in the main house?

12:12.162 --> 12:14.528
<i>You know, you can stay
wherever you want.</i>

12:14.597 --> 12:18.556
I just thought you'd need an empty
closet to hang your things up.

12:19.669 --> 12:21.466
There's only one bedroom
in your place?

12:21.538 --> 12:23.130
<i>Oh, that's no problem.</i>

12:23.206 --> 12:24.503
I mean...

12:27.043 --> 12:28.840
<i>I mean,
I could stay on the sofa.</i>

12:28.912 --> 12:30.709
<i>Well, there is a sofa</i>

12:32.215 --> 12:33.648
and I can empty out
one of the closets.

12:33.717 --> 12:35.742
<i>No, don't be silly.
Really.</i>

12:36.286 --> 12:39.915
<i>Look, we're just a few yards
from each other. So it's fine.</i>

12:41.057 --> 12:43.548
Okay. So that's what
you want to do?

12:45.795 --> 12:47.786
That's what you planned
for me to do.

12:47.864 --> 12:50.697
I want you to stay
where you feel comfortable.

12:50.767 --> 12:51.859
Okay.

12:54.104 --> 12:55.662
Let me start in the main house.

12:55.739 --> 12:57.866
And then I can always move.

12:59.042 --> 13:00.236
Great.

13:03.213 --> 13:06.376
Do you have to be somewhere?
It's okay if you do.

13:07.217 --> 13:10.653
I have to deal with Andrea.
And she is my client.

13:11.121 --> 13:12.918
Did I say she wasn't?

13:16.459 --> 13:18.791
<i>Look, I knew
that you'd have clients,</i>

13:18.862 --> 13:21.592
and be busy and
we'd have to squeeze in time.

13:21.664 --> 13:23.598
<i>No, no, no squeezing.</i>

13:24.234 --> 13:27.328
<i>I mean, I'm completely clear,
except for Andrea.</i>

13:27.404 --> 13:29.929
<i>And I'm sorry about her, but
I shouldn't be gone too long.</i>

13:30.006 --> 13:31.371
Don't say you're sorry.

13:31.441 --> 13:33.739
Why?
Do I sound like a recording?

13:33.810 --> 13:35.334
What?
Nothing.

13:36.679 --> 13:38.874
<i>Look, I'm the one who's sorry.</i>

13:40.450 --> 13:44.409
For not getting out on Friday
because of that stupid continuance.

13:44.587 --> 13:46.521
<i>And then to make things worse,</i>

13:46.589 --> 13:49.422
I took that stupid bump.

13:49.492 --> 13:51.187
And we're on a clock and

13:51.261 --> 13:52.523
I screwed up all your plans.

13:52.595 --> 13:54.062
<i>No! No, no, no.
We're not on a clock.</i>

13:54.130 --> 13:58.658
And the only plans are to relax

13:58.902 --> 14:01.370
<i>and just take it easy, okay?</i>

14:03.773 --> 14:04.865
Okay.

14:15.051 --> 14:16.916
Is it okay?
Yes.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.749
<i>Oh, oh, great. Okay.
Okay.</i>

14:18.922 --> 14:20.787
<i>Well, then, why don't you dress?</i>

14:20.857 --> 14:24.452
And you can put your dress on
while I'm gone.

14:24.527 --> 14:26.051
And then we can

14:27.664 --> 14:29.325
talk to Higgins...

14:30.533 --> 14:32.194
Listen. I don't know what I'm saying.

14:32.268 --> 14:34.395
Can I ask you something?
What?

14:34.471 --> 14:35.563
Look.

14:36.306 --> 14:40.072
Is he the reason that you don't
think I should stay at your place?

14:40.143 --> 14:42.407
Are you afraid that we might
embarrass him or something?

14:42.479 --> 14:45.846
<i>What? Higgins? No, I've had
lots of overnight guests.</i>

14:46.516 --> 14:48.450
That's... Ooh!
That's not what I meant.

14:48.518 --> 14:50.452
<i>Listen, it's none of my... I
mean, I've had guests. Yeah. I...</i>

14:50.520 --> 14:53.182
<i>Thomas,
it's none of my business.</i>

14:56.960 --> 14:58.860
Go take care of Andrea.

15:00.330 --> 15:03.527
<i>What, is she in some kind
of trouble or something?</i>

15:03.600 --> 15:05.727
It's not that big a problem.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.937
Handle it in a couple of hours.

15:12.008 --> 15:14.101
Take all the time you need.

15:19.549 --> 15:22.245
I'm just glad
you're not abandoning her.

15:27.724 --> 15:29.749
<i>I don't believe
you're just abandoning me.</i>

15:29.826 --> 15:32.260
I'm not.
Did you look at the films?

15:32.795 --> 15:33.887
Yeah.

15:34.330 --> 15:37.993
<i>The violence could be fake, and the
murders were cut out of those prints.</i>

15:38.067 --> 15:41.161
Nothing I recognized either.
No tie-in to Danny.

15:41.437 --> 15:43.132
But you're still certain
there were killings in them

15:43.206 --> 15:44.696
and Danny produced them?

15:44.774 --> 15:47.538
Positive. He talked about
the titles all the time.

15:47.610 --> 15:50.443
And I'm positive that his
guys were gunning for me.

15:50.513 --> 15:53.846
<i>But it's my problem, so just
pull over and let me out.</i>

15:53.917 --> 15:55.646
I know that's what you wanna do.

15:55.718 --> 15:57.310
Not necessarily.

15:59.355 --> 16:02.518
<i>Are you serious? The police
can't help, not without proof.</i>

16:02.592 --> 16:05.652
They can give you protection
and check out Danny.

16:05.728 --> 16:07.355
<i>Yeah, and then
they'll dump me, too.</i>

16:07.430 --> 16:09.193
I'm not dumping you.

16:11.301 --> 16:12.632
Where are you going?

16:12.702 --> 16:15.535
<i>The airport, if I can make it in one piece.</i>

16:16.739 --> 16:18.036
Andrea...

16:18.107 --> 16:21.474
<i>Thomas, I don't blame you
for telling me to get lost.</i>

16:21.544 --> 16:24.035
I've caused you
nothing but trouble.

16:26.516 --> 16:28.484
<i>Good-bye, and good luck
with your marriage.</i>

16:28.551 --> 16:29.643
I'm not getting married.

16:29.719 --> 16:31.380
And don't you think
you're being overly dramatic?

16:31.454 --> 16:32.785
<i>Well, that's your opinion.</i>

16:32.855 --> 16:34.982
Nobody's trying to kill you.

16:41.731 --> 16:43.096
I'm sorry.

16:43.266 --> 16:45.598
No apology is necessary.

16:45.702 --> 16:48.034
Really? I thought
you'd be upset.

16:48.104 --> 16:50.504
<i>If you have reason to believe
that the girl's life is in danger,</i>

16:50.573 --> 16:52.370
I'm most happy to oblige.

16:52.442 --> 16:54.672
A second room will be prepared.

16:54.944 --> 16:56.138
Join me?

16:57.847 --> 16:59.041
Please.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.549
<i>Well, yeah, thanks, Higgins.</i>

17:04.220 --> 17:08.816
<i>Magnum, I must admit that I presumed
you to be an unspeakable cad.</i>

17:08.891 --> 17:10.290
I apologize.

17:10.926 --> 17:13.919
<i>I should have known,
that under the circumstances,</i>

17:13.997 --> 17:16.590
Miss Nicholson
could only be a client.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.560
<i>Well, she'll probably
only be here till tomorrow.</i>

17:23.606 --> 17:27.666
<i>See, I plan to
somehow find some time</i>

17:28.377 --> 17:30.608
to look at and see if Andrea

17:31.047 --> 17:32.742
missed anything in the films.

17:33.950 --> 17:36.783
It doesn't seem fair that
you have to work all weekend.

17:38.755 --> 17:40.120
It doesn't?

17:42.759 --> 17:46.354
<i>Magnum, I approve most heartily.</i>

17:46.896 --> 17:48.830
Miss Farrell is charming.

17:48.898 --> 17:50.957
You're to be congratulated
on your betrothal.

17:51.034 --> 17:52.626
<i>Oh, no, I'm not.</i>

17:52.735 --> 17:54.225
<i>No, he's not.</i>

17:58.841 --> 18:00.069
Cynthia.

18:02.812 --> 18:06.077
There's been
a big misunderstanding.

18:06.249 --> 18:08.581
Misunderstanding?
I don't understand.

18:08.651 --> 18:11.119
<i>You didn't tell Rick
that you had proposed,</i>

18:11.187 --> 18:12.518
and Miss Farrell had accepted?

18:12.588 --> 18:13.919
<i>Well, yes.</i>

18:14.524 --> 18:19.291
<i>I did over a couple of beers, but I also
told him that Cynthia changed her mind.</i>

18:19.462 --> 18:22.863
<i>No, wait a minute, I didn't
exactly change my mind.</i>

18:23.533 --> 18:26.798
<i>No, but you did want the
engagement to remain totally secret,</i>

18:26.869 --> 18:29.167
and your wish will be respected.

18:32.041 --> 18:33.406
Please.

18:33.476 --> 18:35.910
<i>If you say there's been
a misunderstanding, so be it.</i>

18:35.978 --> 18:38.606
I'll call the club
and explain to Rick.

18:48.991 --> 18:51.186
The champagne
was compliments of Higgins.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.787
<i>Yeah. And the dinner, the
dinner was compliments... Here.</i>

18:54.931 --> 18:56.626
Of Rick and me.

18:56.799 --> 18:58.391
Congratulations.

18:58.835 --> 19:02.931
<i>Guys, Higgins was supposed
to explain things.</i>

19:03.005 --> 19:05.667
He did. That's why I put
you two in the office.

19:05.742 --> 19:08.302
<i>You know, it's private
and it's secretive and...</i>

19:08.377 --> 19:10.868
<i>Well, I guess
I better get back out front.</i>

19:10.947 --> 19:13.541
<i>You know,
it's Saturday night madness.</i>

19:16.419 --> 19:18.387
<i>Oh, yeah, I guess
I better leave you two alone.</i>

19:18.454 --> 19:19.887
Enjoy the night.

19:19.956 --> 19:21.287
<i>Oh, and once again...</i>

19:21.357 --> 19:23.154
Congratulations.

19:30.433 --> 19:33.027
I'll straighten this out.
I promise.

19:33.102 --> 19:34.592
<i>Oh, forget it.</i>

19:35.872 --> 19:39.433
<i>I mean, how can I be upset
at my first engagement dinner?</i>

19:47.216 --> 19:49.548
To the rest of your visit.
Right.

20:02.231 --> 20:06.395
<i>Oh, have you left time to get
me to the airport tomorrow?</i>

20:07.069 --> 20:08.900
It seemed like
an awfully long cab ride

20:08.971 --> 20:11.496
and I have to be there
an hour ahead.

20:12.008 --> 20:14.306
<i>Cynthia, I won't
let you miss your plane.</i>

20:14.377 --> 20:15.571
<i>No, no.</i>

20:17.046 --> 20:19.037
<i>Normally, it wouldn't matter,</i>

20:19.115 --> 20:22.676
but I have to be in court
at 10:00 on Monday.

20:23.486 --> 20:24.646
Right.

20:28.424 --> 20:31.018
This was really a dumb idea.
It wasn't dumb.

20:31.093 --> 20:32.924
<i>No, coming over
in the middle of a trial.</i>

20:32.995 --> 20:35.429
<i>No, it wasn't dumb,
not after we made plans.</i>

20:35.498 --> 20:37.728
You had to come over sometime.

20:38.601 --> 20:40.432
You ready for dinner?

20:41.704 --> 20:42.864
Right.

20:46.576 --> 20:48.441
<i>So, tomorrow...
Mmm-hmm?</i>

20:48.644 --> 20:52.205
T.C. Is going to take us
for a helicopter ride.

20:52.281 --> 20:53.270
Uh-huh.

20:53.349 --> 20:55.749
I've planned
for some scuba diving.

20:55.818 --> 20:58.412
<i>And I'd like to start off by,</i>

20:58.988 --> 21:02.515
<i>I mean, if you'd like to, by watching
the sunrise. They're pretty special.</i>

21:02.592 --> 21:04.116
<i>Oh, sounds great.</i>

21:04.193 --> 21:05.683
So we'll make it an early night.

21:05.761 --> 21:08.992
<i>And I'll set my alarm
for, what? 5:30, 6:00?</i>

21:10.266 --> 21:11.665
Early night?

21:12.501 --> 21:14.765
<i>No, not early early.</i>

21:15.471 --> 21:17.029
<i>Whatever.
No, forget it.</i>

21:17.106 --> 21:19.370
<i>No, come on, if you're tired...
I don't need to sleep at all.</i>

21:19.442 --> 21:21.842
I can sleep when I get back
to LA. Would you just relax?

21:21.911 --> 21:23.845
I'd like to enjoy this.

21:23.913 --> 21:25.505
<i>But, you're not.</i>

21:29.118 --> 21:30.517
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

21:31.687 --> 21:33.780
You're sorry you came over?

21:34.290 --> 21:35.882
Only if you are.

21:37.260 --> 21:41.356
<i>I mean, I get the feeling that
you don't know what to do with me.</i>

21:42.164 --> 21:44.155
<i>That's not true, I made plans.</i>

21:44.233 --> 21:45.393
Plans?

21:47.370 --> 21:48.962
Let's be honest.

21:51.274 --> 21:54.004
<i>I don't know
what to do with you, either.</i>

21:55.111 --> 21:56.305
Because

21:58.281 --> 22:00.681
you don't wanna seem
presumptuous?

22:00.816 --> 22:04.115
Is that what the problem is?
Are we being that dumb?

22:04.921 --> 22:06.684
It has been a while.

22:07.023 --> 22:08.149
Yeah.

22:08.891 --> 22:12.327
Would you hate me if I told
you that I took that bump

22:13.229 --> 22:16.926
because I was putting it off?

22:17.900 --> 22:21.233
I don't... Scared.
Is that the right word?

22:22.605 --> 22:24.800
I didn't know what to expect.

22:25.675 --> 22:27.267
<i>Well, me either.</i>

22:27.877 --> 22:30.710
And I didn't wanna expect anything. And I...

22:32.682 --> 22:36.641
I didn't want you to think
that I was expecting something.

22:38.821 --> 22:42.951
<i>And I didn't expect all the unexpected
things that happened, either.</i>

22:43.326 --> 22:45.419
<i>Let's start over, okay?</i>

22:46.929 --> 22:48.521
I just got here.

22:50.933 --> 22:52.025
Good.

23:38.581 --> 23:40.242
It's getting late.

23:40.583 --> 23:43.381
Maybe we should
move to another location.

23:45.888 --> 23:48.823
Did you really wanna stay
in the guest house?

23:50.026 --> 23:53.223
<i>Well, I'm not that worried
about the closet space.</i>

23:55.698 --> 23:57.723
Mr. Magnum.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.025
<i>Mr. Magnum,
could I...</i>

24:00.503 --> 24:03.336
<i>Mr. Magnum, I need to talk to you
for... Alone for just a minute.</i>

24:03.406 --> 24:05.135
Yeah. Right.

24:06.008 --> 24:09.000
I'll be right back.
We will finish this dance.

24:09.478 --> 24:11.537
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Magnum,
but there's a lady outside</i>

24:11.614 --> 24:13.172
and she really needs to see you. A lady?

24:13.249 --> 24:15.183
Who is it?
I'm kind of busy right now.

24:15.251 --> 24:18.414
<i>Mr. Magnum, please,
there's trouble with the car.</i>

24:18.988 --> 24:20.182
Sorry.

24:21.424 --> 24:23.551
<i>Cynthia, I'll be right back.</i>

24:25.795 --> 24:27.786
Have you seen Mr. Wright?

24:35.171 --> 24:36.195
Thomas!
Andrea!

24:36.272 --> 24:37.739
Please hurry!
What are you doing here?

24:37.807 --> 24:40.332
There's no damage to the car. I just
knew that would get you out here.

24:40.409 --> 24:42.809
We have to go.
Go? Go where?

24:43.079 --> 24:45.604
Danny found out I was staying
at the estate. I had to run.

24:45.681 --> 24:47.478
<i>Oh, now come on,
just calm down, will you?</i>

24:47.550 --> 24:50.849
How can I calm down when they
could be watching right now?

24:50.920 --> 24:52.251
<i>Thomas, please.</i>

24:52.321 --> 24:55.950
<i>I'll go to the cops, I'll do anything
you say, please, just help me!</i>

24:56.025 --> 24:58.255
<i>No, no, don't do this again.</i>

24:59.428 --> 25:01.259
I'm sorry. It's okay.

25:13.042 --> 25:15.010
<i>Just calm down, let's go inside.</i>

25:15.077 --> 25:18.274
Danny will not hurt you.
No! We gotta get out of here!

25:18.347 --> 25:20.975
<i>He's not gonna do anything!
Yes, he is!</i>

25:21.217 --> 25:22.479
Andrea...

25:23.586 --> 25:25.178
Give me my keys!

25:51.347 --> 25:53.110
<i>Officer, I can explain.</i>

25:53.182 --> 25:54.444
I'm a private investigator.

25:54.517 --> 25:58.681
My client here was a little worried
about her personal safety and so...

26:00.322 --> 26:02.187
Andrea! Officer.

26:08.961 --> 26:10.453
<i>When I was ten,</i>

26:12.500 --> 26:18.097
I was beaten to a pulp by a big
12-year-old named Bobby Harris.

26:18.973 --> 26:22.170
<i>Linda Alton had asked me
for half my sandwich,</i>

26:22.243 --> 26:26.236
<i>hoping that it might upset
Bobby, and it definitely did.</i>

26:29.050 --> 26:31.314
<i>Nine years later,
they got married.</i>

26:31.386 --> 26:33.820
And I took some consolation
in the fact

26:33.888 --> 26:38.120
that one of my teeth and half of my
sandwich hadn't been lost in vain.

26:38.393 --> 26:41.226
<i>Still, I have always wished</i>

26:41.996 --> 26:44.521
that Linda could have found...

26:46.601 --> 26:47.932
Thank you.

26:48.036 --> 26:50.334
Linda could have found
some other way

26:50.405 --> 26:52.839
of getting Bobby
to commit himself.

26:56.511 --> 26:59.674
Which brings us back
to the big word "commitment."

27:00.448 --> 27:02.313
Kids just don't know
how to handle it.

27:02.383 --> 27:05.079
Some adults
don't know how to handle it.

27:05.820 --> 27:09.278
<i>I have even known of
relationships that broke up,</i>

27:09.490 --> 27:11.958
<i>not because
they weren't working,</i>

27:13.928 --> 27:15.793
but because they were.

27:16.030 --> 27:19.227
<i>I know that doesn't make
any sense, but it happens.</i>

27:19.867 --> 27:21.425
There must be
a simple explanation.

27:21.502 --> 27:23.993
<i>Yeah, Thomas is bound to have
some good reason for taking off.</i>

27:24.072 --> 27:25.437
<i>Yeah,
but it's after four o'clock.</i>

27:25.506 --> 27:27.030
I still think
we should call the police.

27:27.108 --> 27:29.099
<i>Trust us. Don't worry.
Come on, you know Thomas.</i>

27:29.177 --> 27:31.611
<i>No, I don't.
I mean, not that well.</i>

27:33.881 --> 27:35.212
You don't?

27:35.350 --> 27:36.408
But you two are getting...

27:36.484 --> 27:37.849
<i>No, T. C.,
we are not getting married.</i>

27:37.919 --> 27:41.218
<i>Okay, okay, let's not get
into that again, unless...</i>

27:41.956 --> 27:44.823
Did one of you break this
off? Is that what happened?

27:44.892 --> 27:46.792
What do you mean
"Is that what happened?"

27:46.861 --> 27:50.262
<i>Look, we know Thomas. And whatever
he's up to, he's got a good reason.</i>

27:50.331 --> 27:51.730
Right?
Right.

27:51.866 --> 27:54.596
<i>I mean, it'll make good
sense when they get back.</i>

27:54.669 --> 27:56.534
They?
Thomas and the Ferrari.

27:56.604 --> 28:00.005
<i>And if either is damaged, the two
of you will be held accountable.</i>

28:00.074 --> 28:01.063
Higgins.

28:01.142 --> 28:02.507
I called him. I was worried.

28:02.577 --> 28:04.442
Indeed. Magnum has been
missing for over four hours

28:04.512 --> 28:06.776
and you haven't even
bothered to notify the police?

28:06.848 --> 28:09.646
<i>Well, he's disappeared a lot
of times, for a lot longer.</i>

28:09.717 --> 28:10.979
Not under these circumstances.

28:11.052 --> 28:12.383
What could possibly
have taken him

28:12.453 --> 28:13.784
from Miss Farrell's side
this evening?

28:13.855 --> 28:15.948
<i>Don't ask, Higgins.
Just believe us.</i>

28:16.023 --> 28:18.423
It is not a matter
for the police.

28:21.662 --> 28:22.822
Quite.

28:24.599 --> 28:26.533
<i>Miss Farrell, perhaps you
should return to the estate?</i>

28:26.601 --> 28:28.967
Wait a minute.
Another woman?

28:29.404 --> 28:31.338
Thomas left here
with somebody else?

28:31.406 --> 28:33.033
<i>Oh, no, we didn't say that.</i>

28:33.107 --> 28:34.904
<i>No, you didn't have to.</i>

28:34.976 --> 28:37.604
Was she redheaded? Great legs? Yeah.

28:37.678 --> 28:39.145
<i>You know them?
I mean, her?</i>

28:39.213 --> 28:40.942
<i>Oh, Miss Nicholson.</i>

28:41.816 --> 28:43.681
There must have been a break
in the case.

28:43.751 --> 28:44.911
She's a client?

28:44.986 --> 28:49.616
Yes. Something to do with the
producer of gentlemen's cinema.

28:50.124 --> 28:52.922
Gentlemen's...
Oh! You mean porno films.

28:54.028 --> 28:56.690
That's it!
That'll explain everything.

28:56.764 --> 28:58.459
See? That explains everything.

28:58.533 --> 29:00.524
Except where Thomas is.

29:00.635 --> 29:01.863
He could still be in trouble.

29:01.936 --> 29:03.301
I doubt it.

29:04.105 --> 29:05.231
<i>Miss Farrell, I'm sorry,</i>

29:05.306 --> 29:08.639
but Magnum has a tendency to become
obsessed with his investigations.

29:08.776 --> 29:11.677
Sometimes to the point
of being thoughtless.

29:11.813 --> 29:13.906
You're worrying needlessly.

29:15.316 --> 29:17.409
At least about his welfare.

29:18.553 --> 29:20.783
<i>Magnum, you're in big trouble.</i>

29:21.756 --> 29:24.088
I have a friend
on Makali Street.

29:27.061 --> 29:29.393
3824 is a barber shop.

29:31.466 --> 29:32.865
Barber shop?

29:34.135 --> 29:35.898
I gave you
the address of my barber.

29:35.970 --> 29:38.268
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm confused.

29:50.451 --> 29:52.282
1441 Mahali.

29:55.022 --> 29:57.286
Do you have a friend
who lives on Mahali?

29:57.358 --> 29:59.383
I have friends everywhere.

30:00.094 --> 30:04.428
<i>And I don't need to leave to check
it out, if that's what you're hoping.</i>

30:09.837 --> 30:12.397
<i>Hey, come on, what is that?
The number of your tailor?</i>

30:12.473 --> 30:14.600
<i>If you do know where she is,
you're crazy for not telling him.</i>

30:14.675 --> 30:17.200
Yeah. You don't know
Danny or Andrea.

30:17.378 --> 30:18.777
She's just not worth it.

30:18.846 --> 30:21.406
What's gonna happen to her
if you find her?

30:21.482 --> 30:23.780
<i>Whatever happens to her,
she's got it coming.</i>

30:23.851 --> 30:24.875
<i>Hey, come on,</i>

30:24.952 --> 30:26.476
you really think
you're gonna change things?

30:26.554 --> 30:29.717
You just don't understand the
mess that Andrea got you into.

30:29.790 --> 30:32.816
You better forget it before
Danny really hurts you.

30:32.894 --> 30:35.021
Can I have a glass of water?

30:47.375 --> 30:50.538
<i>We're trying to give you
some good advice, Magnum.</i>

30:51.345 --> 30:52.676
All right.

30:54.782 --> 30:57.478
Tell him I'll give him
the real address.

33:11.519 --> 33:12.679
Hello!

33:20.127 --> 33:21.321
Hello!

33:56.897 --> 33:58.524
You did what with a chair?

33:58.599 --> 34:00.191
<i>Never mind.
Are Rick and T.C. There?</i>

34:00.267 --> 34:01.495
No. They're out
looking for you.

34:01.569 --> 34:03.662
<i>Magnum, where in
heaven's name are you?</i>

34:03.738 --> 34:05.535
<i>We've been most concerned.</i>

34:05.606 --> 34:07.437
<i>I'm fine.
Look, can you find them</i>

34:07.508 --> 34:10.409
and ask them to keep Cynthia
entertained till I get home?

34:10.543 --> 34:11.806
<i>Keep her...
No, Higgins.</i>

34:11.879 --> 34:13.277
<i>Please now, it's important.</i>

34:13.347 --> 34:16.315
<i>They know what to do,
the helicopter rides, diving.</i>

34:16.382 --> 34:18.010
<i>Thomas, are you all right?</i>

34:18.085 --> 34:19.313
Cynthia.

34:20.321 --> 34:23.380
<i>Well, I had a little problem,
but I'm okay now.</i>

34:23.456 --> 34:25.583
Could you take a later flight?

34:25.659 --> 34:27.422
Just by a few hours?

34:27.561 --> 34:29.529
<i>What? Wait, no.</i>

34:29.597 --> 34:31.996
Would you mind telling me
where you are and...

34:32.065 --> 34:34.762
I'll explain everything
when I get back.

34:35.536 --> 34:38.004
But I really wanna see you
before you leave.

34:38.339 --> 34:40.830
<i>Well, I guess
I owe you three hours.</i>

34:41.742 --> 34:44.438
There's a flight
that leaves at...

34:44.512 --> 34:47.242
4:00. You'll have to
leave the estate at 2:00.

34:47.313 --> 34:49.009
<i>I can get back by 1:00,
somehow.</i>

34:49.083 --> 34:50.208
<i>I don't have any money but...</i>

34:50.284 --> 34:52.411
Do you need a lift?
Where are you?

34:52.485 --> 34:54.545
<i>No, Higgins'll know
I don't have the Ferrari.</i>

34:54.621 --> 34:56.748
He doesn't have the Ferrari?

34:57.224 --> 34:59.089
<i>I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell.</i>

34:59.160 --> 35:01.993
<i>I'll call the police,
they'll find me. Bye.</i>

35:13.207 --> 35:14.868
<i>Hi, you live here?</i>

35:18.913 --> 35:21.541
<i>No! Look, I just need to...
Will you call the police?</i>

35:21.615 --> 35:23.173
Better believe I'll call them.

37:59.173 --> 38:00.401
Cynthia!

38:13.302 --> 38:15.600
Did you ever commit to something

38:15.805 --> 38:18.399
you knew you really
weren't committed to?

38:18.474 --> 38:21.136
<i>Well, take my last game at Navy.</i>

38:21.210 --> 38:22.802
<i>We were playing Michigan,</i>

38:22.878 --> 38:25.779
and we all knew
there'd be pro scouts there.

38:25.948 --> 38:27.711
Not that that mattered
much to the Navy guys.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.216
<i>'Cause we were already drafted,</i>

38:29.285 --> 38:31.253
in a manner of speaking.

38:32.288 --> 38:35.314
<i>And I guess I really knew that
they wouldn't be scouting me,</i>

38:35.391 --> 38:37.291
even if I was available.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.652
But that's the point.

38:38.728 --> 38:41.526
<i>See, I was having
one of those great days.</i>

38:41.864 --> 38:44.492
<i>Over 200 yards passing,
two touchdowns.</i>

38:44.567 --> 38:47.559
Maybe...
Maybe my best game ever.

38:48.771 --> 38:50.568
<i>And I started thinking,</i>

38:50.639 --> 38:52.766
why shouldn't
they be interested in me?

38:52.842 --> 38:54.104
<i>You know, for the future?</i>

38:54.176 --> 38:55.803
That's what happened
to Staubach.

38:55.878 --> 38:58.779
<i>Well, that was stupid,
because I wasn't Staubach.</i>

39:00.116 --> 39:04.280
<i>I mean, there comes a time when
you know how good you really are,</i>

39:04.353 --> 39:06.218
and I wasn't Staubach.

39:07.923 --> 39:12.622
<i>So, time's running out,
it's fourth down,</i>

39:12.895 --> 39:14.157
we're trailing by three points

39:14.230 --> 39:17.393
<i>and my wide receiver is
wide open in the end zone,</i>

39:17.500 --> 39:20.492
and I missed him by 20 yards.

39:22.705 --> 39:26.436
<i>Now I hadn't
missed anybody all day,</i>

39:27.343 --> 39:30.278
so I don't know how I
missed him by that much.

39:32.515 --> 39:34.415
But I think I know why.

39:35.017 --> 39:37.611
What if I'd had the best day
a quarterback could ever have

39:37.686 --> 39:39.654
and nobody talked to me?

39:42.224 --> 39:44.749
That says something
about commitment.

39:46.629 --> 39:48.358
The police have a warrant
for your arrest.

39:48.431 --> 39:50.558
<i>Breaking and entering,
vandalism and aggravated assault.</i>

39:50.633 --> 39:53.227
Agra... I didn't assault
the guy! He assaulted me!

39:53.302 --> 39:54.326
You may tell it to the police.

39:54.403 --> 39:55.734
I had no choice
but to inform them

39:55.805 --> 39:59.002
that you had returned on a
cycle. Where is the Ferrari?

39:59.074 --> 40:01.304
<i>No, I'm still waiting.
So am I.</i>

40:02.578 --> 40:04.136
<i>Look,
as soon as I find Andrea...</i>

40:04.213 --> 40:05.237
It shouldn't be difficult.

40:05.314 --> 40:08.147
She called and said that it was urgent
that you reach her at this number.

40:08.217 --> 40:09.377
She sounded most upset.

40:09.452 --> 40:11.477
What does Miss Nicholson
have to do with the Ferrari?

40:11.554 --> 40:14.079
<i>Hello?
Cynthia.</i>

40:14.523 --> 40:16.081
Please don't leave.

40:17.326 --> 40:20.591
I have to leave. I was just about
to board when I got your page.

40:20.663 --> 40:24.326
Could you maybe take
the late flight out at 9:30?

40:24.633 --> 40:26.897
<i>I know you'd have
to fly overnight,</i>

40:26.969 --> 40:28.937
but it would really mean
a lot to me.

40:29.371 --> 40:32.807
<i>Thomas, look, I still have briefs to go over,</i>

40:32.875 --> 40:36.311
and I have to get a little
sleep before court tomorrow.

40:37.079 --> 40:38.706
<i>Well, yeah, I understand.</i>

40:38.781 --> 40:40.248
<i>Miss Farrell, good news.</i>

40:40.316 --> 40:43.444
We had a cancellation.
You're on the 9:30 flight.

40:43.519 --> 40:45.043
<i>Cynthia, are you there?</i>

40:45.120 --> 40:46.212
Yeah.

40:47.656 --> 40:51.092
<i>Well, I guess I'll have to
say good-bye over the phone.</i>

40:53.929 --> 40:55.157
Cynthia?

40:56.198 --> 40:57.790
Okay.

40:57.867 --> 41:01.598
<i>Let me see if I can get
a seat on the 9:30, okay?</i>

41:02.104 --> 41:03.765
Great!
I'll be there at 7:00.

41:03.839 --> 41:04.999
7:00?

41:05.441 --> 41:06.908
Maybe sooner. Thanks. Bye.

41:07.142 --> 41:09.474
<i>Magnum, I sympathize with your
desire to see Miss Farrell,</i>

41:09.545 --> 41:12.309
but you mustn't leave until you're
certain that Miss Nicholson is safe.

41:12.381 --> 41:14.008
What does she have to do
with the Ferrari?

41:14.083 --> 41:15.277
I am working on the problem!

41:15.351 --> 41:17.285
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

41:18.888 --> 41:19.946
<i>Who is this?</i>

41:20.956 --> 41:22.685
Andrea's in big trouble.

41:22.758 --> 41:25.318
<i>The guy who's trying to kill
her just answered the phone,</i>

41:25.394 --> 41:27.692
on the number that she gave you.

41:29.265 --> 41:30.892
I gotta get over there.
Over where?

41:30.966 --> 41:32.433
I don't know.

41:32.568 --> 41:36.197
<i>But, see, Carol gave me this
backwards telephone directory.</i>

41:36.739 --> 41:38.934
And if I can just...

41:40.643 --> 41:43.510
<i>2-1-7, 2-1... Yeah.</i>

41:44.013 --> 41:45.776
41...

41:46.115 --> 41:48.640
Silver Beach Road? He couldn't
live on this side of the island.

41:48.717 --> 41:49.706
I gotta take the jeep.

41:49.785 --> 41:51.650
What about the Ferrari?

41:51.720 --> 41:53.210
It's not here.

42:50.379 --> 42:53.177
<i>Hold it, Danny!
Oh, no, Thomas! Don't shoot!</i>

42:53.248 --> 42:54.840
<i>Drop it, Magnum.</i>

42:57.319 --> 42:59.549
<i>Hey, drop it. Really. Really.
Really. It's not necessary.</i>

42:59.622 --> 43:00.953
I was gonna
bring the car back later

43:01.023 --> 43:02.490
<i>and explain everything, Thomas.</i>

43:02.591 --> 43:04.218
Didn't you get my message?

43:04.293 --> 43:05.521
Everything's okay now.

43:05.594 --> 43:07.221
Danny and I patched things up.

43:07.296 --> 43:09.890
<i>She's right.
I'm really sorry, Magnum.</i>

43:09.965 --> 43:13.093
But Andrea just shouldn't get other
people messed up in our problems.

43:13.168 --> 43:14.362
<i>It is kinda cute though,
isn't it?</i>

43:14.436 --> 43:17.269
<i>I mean, this lady will do
anything just to get my attention.</i>

43:17.339 --> 43:20.035
<i>I tried to tell you, Magnum.
They've been doing this for years.</i>

43:20.109 --> 43:21.906
I didn't mean
for him to hurt you.

43:21.977 --> 43:23.410
<i>If I'd known
your fiancée were coming in,</i>

43:23.479 --> 43:25.276
I never would've hired you
in the first place.

43:25.347 --> 43:28.339
<i>That's nonsense. I mean, she'll
do anything when she's crazy.</i>

43:28.417 --> 43:29.577
<i>I must confess, though,</i>

43:29.652 --> 43:31.552
I didn't believe that
you could've bought her story

43:31.620 --> 43:32.644
about me doing snuff films.

43:32.721 --> 43:35.087
<i>I mean, nobody does
snuff films anymore.</i>

43:35.157 --> 43:37.022
<i>I'm sorry
about your face, though.</i>

43:37.092 --> 43:39.686
Truth is that
we owe you an awful lot.

43:39.862 --> 43:42.592
<i>So, maybe this will make
up for your troubles.</i>

43:42.665 --> 43:44.758
Danny and I
are on the ground now.

43:44.833 --> 43:48.291
This won't happen again. I
hope that's some consolation.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.507
There you go.

43:59.782 --> 44:00.806
I'm sorry.

44:00.883 --> 44:02.908
We really do have to ask
everyone to board now.

44:02.985 --> 44:04.213
Cynthia!

44:07.690 --> 44:09.214
You look awful.

44:09.958 --> 44:12.051
Yeah. At least I made it.

44:17.433 --> 44:18.923
I really should leave.
No.

44:19.001 --> 44:20.025
I mean you really have to.

44:20.102 --> 44:21.535
<i>Well, I have to.
No, I'm okay.</i>

44:21.603 --> 44:24.037
I shouldn't leave...
We'll try again.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.601
Do you wanna come to LA?
Now?

44:26.842 --> 44:28.867
No. I mean after I'm through with the trial.

44:28.944 --> 44:30.912
<i>I'm sorry, we have to go now. Yeah, I know.</i>

44:30.979 --> 44:32.879
<i>Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, I guess so.</i>

44:32.948 --> 44:35.178
You don't wanna come back here?

44:35.951 --> 44:37.646
They're closing the gate.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.654
<i>Listen, I had a real great time.</i>

44:39.722 --> 44:41.212
Time? No you didn't.
Don't say you did.

44:41.290 --> 44:42.348
No! Really! Come on.

44:42.424 --> 44:43.857
It wasn't all bad.

44:43.926 --> 44:45.416
Really?
Really.

44:47.162 --> 44:49.221
LA?
Or here?

44:58.874 --> 45:01.069
It was great to see you again.

45:01.376 --> 45:03.503
<i>And it was great to see her.</i>

45:04.179 --> 45:05.840
What I saw of her.

45:07.182 --> 45:09.412
We had a nice couple of hours.

45:12.788 --> 45:14.813
We were really making contact.

45:14.890 --> 45:18.587
<i>Well, I mean, we weren't and
then we were, then we couldn't.</i>

45:18.827 --> 45:20.158
So I guess

45:21.497 --> 45:24.762
<i>the other 22 hours, 19,
whatever, they don't matter.</i>

45:25.167 --> 45:29.501
I just have to think about
those couple of hours at the club

45:30.706 --> 45:33.470
and see if they committed us
to anything.

45:35.110 --> 45:36.975
I guess I'll find out.

45:39.381 --> 45:41.679
<i>You know,
in a funny kind of way,</i>

45:41.750 --> 45:43.445
I almost envy Danny and Andrea.

45:43.519 --> 45:45.851
At least they know
what they want.

45:45.921 --> 45:49.118
Even if sometimes they
don't know they want it.

45:51.026 --> 45:52.391
I gotta go.

45:54.363 --> 45:57.526
I'm still wanted on
an aggravated assault charge.
