WEBVTT

00:36.411 --> 00:37.788
Big boy,
this is little boy.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.044
How'd things go
down at the chicken coop?

00:40.791 --> 00:42.464
Weigh station inspector needs to learn

00:42.584 --> 00:44.211
some adult words and a bit of hygiene,

00:44.294 --> 00:46.092
but he waved us through.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.798
The cargo is secure.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.846
Looks like a clean shot from here.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.932
Roger that. Little girl
will take point on your front door.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.518
See you at
the drop stop, Mack. I'm clear.

01:13.699 --> 01:14.746
Son of a bitch.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.127
You see that?

01:21.206 --> 01:23.425
Little girl is down.
Escort Two is down.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.632
I know, Sherlock! What the hell hit us?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.516
We need to go to alt two, alt two.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.265
Nothing over
our shoulder. Back door is clear.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.142
Protect the cargo at all costs.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.611
S.H.I.E.L.D. region C.T.,
this is Agent Mack.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.530
We are under attack
from an unseen I-don't-know-what.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.738
Agent Mack,
advise nature of threat. Over.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.827
What in the holy name of...

01:58.702 --> 02:00.704
S.H.I.E.L.D. region C.T...

02:01.747 --> 02:03.374
Oh, hell, I can't explain.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.047
Oh, no!

02:10.047 --> 02:11.549
Agent Mack, come in.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.434
Are you there, Agent Mack?

02:47.209 --> 02:48.256
Are we there yet?

03:01.765 --> 03:02.812
You know you're late.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.444
I'm tired. From the morning's workout.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.655
I thought I was joining
S.H.I.E.L.D., not 24-Hour Fitness.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.943
It's called relative strength
training. Starting with the basics.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.616
And next time, you do 15 pushups
for every minute you're late.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.495
Fine, Mister Fun-Machine.
Better than pull-ups.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.286
I don't ever wanna do
another pull-up again.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.998
You find yourself hanging off the edge
of a building 20 stories up,

03:26.123 --> 03:27.170
you're gonna wanna do at least one.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.261
Stand here. Jab, cross. Like this.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.597
Ten minutes.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.475
You know the hardest
part about boxing?

03:36.925 --> 03:37.972
Getting punched in the face?

03:38.468 --> 03:39.765
Keeping your hands up.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.309
Why do I even have to do this?

03:41.430 --> 03:43.524
I'm sure Fitz-Simmons'
supervising officer

03:43.640 --> 03:46.439
didn't make them do this muscle stuff.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.981
You said you wanted
to be a field agent like Coulson.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.200
Well, if you'd like to switch disciplines...

03:53.608 --> 03:55.235
Hey, Simmons, what did your S.O.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.987
give you guys for morning drills?

03:57.320 --> 03:58.537
Oh, atomistic attribute drills.

03:59.197 --> 04:02.041
Yeah, we'd name
the mechanical, chemical, thermal...

04:02.159 --> 04:03.331
Electrical properties of materials...

04:03.452 --> 04:05.705
Okay, okay, they made your point.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.171
There will come a moment
when you have to commit to this, or bail.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.129
Every field agent
has a defining moment. Ask Coulson.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.514
When you have to make the hard call.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.599
To either dedicate yourself to this,

04:18.716 --> 04:20.685
or to curl up in a ball and run.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.639
How can you run
if you're curled up in a ball?

04:24.055 --> 04:28.185
It's my job as your S.O.
to make sure you don't die before then.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.690
Come on.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.030
So what was yours, Agent Ward?

04:32.314 --> 04:33.361
Ten minutes.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.866
Your defining moment.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.321
Come on, tell me. I wanna know.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.791
I could get Coulson
to give you some of that truth serum.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.369
You could spill
your little heart out to me again.

04:46.036 --> 04:51.167
You mean my Level 1 overshare that
miraculously got you to cooperate?

04:52.542 --> 04:54.044
I hate to tell you this, rookie,

04:54.211 --> 04:55.713
but we don't have a truth serum.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.010
Changing course.
Briefing in three.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.012
Ah. Looks like we're on the move.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.521
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 with new orders,

05:04.638 --> 05:06.732
set for Colorado airfield, north.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.694
A few minutes ago
a S.H.I.E.L.D. transport was attacked

05:11.770 --> 05:13.943
while carrying
a priority red protected asset,

05:14.064 --> 05:15.691
off Route 76 near Sterling.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.367
Priority red?

05:17.692 --> 05:19.035
The asset was Canadian physicist

05:19.110 --> 05:21.454
Dr. Franklin Hall, known for his work...

05:21.530 --> 05:23.077
- Oh, no, not Frank.
-Doctor Hall?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.701
He was our chemical kinetics
advisor our second year.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.879
Yeah, he's so enthusiastic
about science, we just adored him.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.251
We can rescue him, can't we?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.915
He's one of ours. We're gonna try.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.083
And the attackers?

05:33.208 --> 05:34.425
Invisible.

05:35.043 --> 05:38.468
Wait, invisible?  Cool.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.593
But terrible.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.763
Doctor Hall was an asset?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.355
One of
a few select scientists

05:47.430 --> 05:49.057
S.H.I.E.L.D. has been protecting.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.767
People our enemies
would love to get their hands on.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.236
We keep them hidden,
keep them on the move.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.606
Which is why Fitz and I
were so lucky to have him.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.777
We don't have him anymore.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.571
And what does priority red mean?

05:58.650 --> 06:00.197
It means security should've been...

06:01.903 --> 06:03.120
heavy.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.413
It was pretty damn scary.
And I don't spook easily, boss.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.794
Nothing in the air? From above?

06:09.995 --> 06:11.588
And nothing over our shoulder.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.633
But what's scary is, they knew our route.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.627
They were waiting for us.

06:16.835 --> 06:17.961
Are you saying they were working

06:18.086 --> 06:19.178
with somebody inside S.H.I.E.L.D.?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.137
Sorry to say, it had to be.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.969
Fitz, what am I seeing here?

06:26.469 --> 06:31.316
Well, I'm not wearing
the full-spectrum goggles I designed,

06:32.517 --> 06:33.609
so,  no clue.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.359
Let me have a look.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.116
No, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!
Don't move. Wait a second.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.450
What the hell?

06:44.863 --> 06:49.869
I think the eiectro-static
field scanner activated some... thing.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.670
Okay. Can we deactivate it? Now?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.676
- You have to increase the density!
-I tried, Fitz!

07:00.378 --> 07:01.925
Fitz!

07:03.173 --> 07:04.345
Whoa!

07:12.349 --> 07:14.522
That did all this.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.192
What is that?

07:22.025 --> 07:23.993
Something big.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.960
Either someone
cracked our comm system,

07:36.039 --> 07:38.883
or Doctor Hall's movements leaked
from inside S.H.I.E.L.D.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.510
You really think we have a mole?

07:40.669 --> 07:43.092
I think you should go through the
communication logs. Rule it out.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.716
We'll work the tractor tread
that we found on the scene.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.555
I can do that. Instead of pull-ups.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.053
I can upload
the image of the tread pattern

07:49.177 --> 07:50.474
and check to see if there's any...

07:50.553 --> 07:51.725
Already done.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.849
Matched it to a 2010 model.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.276
Found a list of purchasers
within 500-mile radius,

07:56.518 --> 07:58.520
narrowed down to
those with priors, financial troubles,

07:58.603 --> 07:59.900
or a propensity for risk-taking.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.610
Three suspects.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.028
Who may have sold their construction

08:03.108 --> 08:05.452
equipment to the kidnappers. We'll ask.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.740
Hey. So, Ward said a funny thing.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.622
He said that you guys
don't have a truth serum.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.791
Did he? Ward said that?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.213
- Yeah.
-interesting.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.758
Yeah. Hey, wait, but... I...

08:19.874 --> 08:21.376
Hey.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.591
Do you want me to bench press this?

08:24.713 --> 08:25.760
Read it.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.848
Every communication out of HQ since

08:27.966 --> 08:29.934
they decided to transfer Doctor Hall.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.938
Hang in there, Doc.
It's gonna be a while.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.698
Excuse me.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.902
The hell are you?

08:47.277 --> 08:48.870
A concerned citizen,

08:48.945 --> 08:52.700
who happens to be a member of a
giant bureaucratic organization

08:52.782 --> 08:53.874
that's tracking your every move.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.702
I haven't done anything wrong.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.877
Of course not.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.044
But you sold your excavator
to some people who did.

09:00.123 --> 09:03.878
And you're hiding out here until things
cool down because you know it.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.046
I just wanna know who paid you.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.721
They paid me enough
not to answer any questions like that.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.440
Feels like the Old West.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.568
They gave me money
for my equipment, that's all.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.645
I never saw a face
and I never heard a name.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.649
And how did you receive this
money? They write you a check?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.748
Paid you in gold?

09:36.868 --> 09:38.495
Now it really feels like the Old West.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.504
It looks like this because it's a dore bar.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.178
It means it was made
at the mine rather than in a refinery.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.927
It's only about 92% pure.
The cowboy got cheated a bit.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.013
Can you determine the mine
based on the impurities?

09:52.342 --> 09:54.344
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've done that already.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.273
It's from the Dacey Mine in Tanzania.

09:58.681 --> 09:59.978
- Hmm.
-Which is owned by...

10:00.350 --> 10:01.522
Quinn Worldwide.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.857
I'm sure you studied the CEO in your
chemical engineering classes,

10:05.980 --> 10:09.109
or saw him on
the cover of Forbes. Ian Quinn.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.619
We can't just pluck
it from the ground like a potato.

10:15.698 --> 10:20.044
It needs to be extracted from the
ore and enriched. I know.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.542
You know, tell him this investment

10:21.663 --> 10:23.040
paid for that ridiculous yacht of his,

10:23.123 --> 10:26.548
and that he'll thank me
at the shareholders' meeting.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.807
Why is he tied up?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.175
Quinn.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.686
Does he look like a threat?

10:39.180 --> 10:40.352
I'm sorry about these guys.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.569
Welcome to Malta, Frank.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.947
You know, it's one thing to steal

10:52.068 --> 10:53.661
my ideas, Ian, but stealing me?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.326
First of all, I never stole your ideas.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.329
We've always agreed
information should be free.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.332
It's amazing how much money you
made off free information.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.413
And secondly, think of this
as a rescue mission, Frank.

11:03.538 --> 11:06.007
In fact, in a moment
I think you'll be thanking me.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.592
My staff intercepted a communication

11:08.710 --> 11:10.508
about the movement of a certain asset,

11:10.587 --> 11:13.716
and then when I deduced
that asset was you,

11:14.090 --> 11:16.092
I couldn't pass up on the opportunity.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.096
It's a little out of my comfort zone, sure.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.265
Malta.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.441
You're not stupid.
S.H.I.E.L.D. can't come after you here.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.355
Not just S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.112
I am now
a naturalized citizen of this fair country.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.368
Stunning beaches, beautiful tax laws,

11:33.443 --> 11:36.117
and a deep-seated hatred
of outside forces telling them what to do.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.956
Sounds like your dating profile.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.618
Right.
I moved my entire operation down here.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.544
Bought the old prime minister's estate.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.963
It's not really my style,

11:45.079 --> 11:47.548
but they had this huge
underground facility, so I figured, hey.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.627
Always been a stubborn bastard.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.299
And now you've finally found a place

11:52.420 --> 11:53.922
where the watchdogs can't touch you.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.053
Not without breaking international law.

11:58.384 --> 12:02.184
Ah! But more importantly,
old friend, they can't touch you.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.488
Recognize the design?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.401
We were barely old enough to drink

12:15.526 --> 12:16.618
when you sketched the blueprint.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.197
That's just a miniature prototype.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.619
A theoretical machine
powered by a theoretical substance.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.504
Frank, you were right.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.379
You found it?

12:30.667 --> 12:31.668
Gravitonium.

12:31.834 --> 12:32.960
It's an extremely rare,

12:33.044 --> 12:34.341
high-atomic numbered element...

12:34.504 --> 12:35.847
...that powers the device.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.592
So extremely rare
that most people didn't believe it existed,

12:38.675 --> 12:40.928
much less the theory
that an isolated positive charge...

12:41.010 --> 12:42.978
Yeah, would turn the flow
from isotropic...

12:43.054 --> 12:44.897
Guys? High school dropout here.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.857
How does the device work again?

12:47.350 --> 12:50.980
Well, gravitonium
distorts gravity fields within itself,

12:51.062 --> 12:53.656
causing an undulating,
amorphous shape.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.156
Which causes these, um,
wiggly bits here.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.618
But when an electric current is applied,

13:00.697 --> 13:04.076
the gravitonium solidifies.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.292
And those gravity fields erupt,

13:08.371 --> 13:10.874
randomly changing
the rules of gravity around it.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.380
Well, so, now you can
imagine what would happen to a big rig

13:13.543 --> 13:16.012
at 100 kilometers per hour.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.839
Or you... Well, you could just remember,

13:17.922 --> 13:19.299
'cause we saw it already, didn't we?

13:19.382 --> 13:20.725
Yeah, and guess which genius

13:20.842 --> 13:23.937
published every theory about
gravitonium, and possible applications?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.054
Years ago.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.897
- Doctor Franklin Hall.
- Correct.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.434
And Dr. Hall attended
the University of Cambridge

13:29.559 --> 13:31.232
at the same time as Ian Quinn.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.521
Coulson may be off on this.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.448
Quinn is a notoriously good guy.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.909
His charity endowment's
something like $8 billion.

13:38.026 --> 13:41.451
Yes. With money made from
leeching the Earth of its resources.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.414
Looks like he's dug up another.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.623
Twenty years, 12 mines, six continents.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.088
But, yes, I finally found it.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.916
And now,
we get to play with it.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.262
Do you remember,
in all our talks on Orchard Street,

13:58.379 --> 14:01.974
the part where it's very, very dangerous?

14:02.592 --> 14:03.935
Everything powerful is dangerous.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.601
But I'm not gonna
convince you with more talk.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.776
Talk of 50% shares,
talk of Nobel Prizes. No, not you.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.107
You will just have to see it.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.071
I built the full-size generator,

14:23.321 --> 14:27.076
but I need you to
tell me how to control the gravity fields.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.878
You can complete your life's work.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.127
I plan to do this
with or without you, but I know you.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.176
I know you'd want it done right.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.306
Now's the moment when you thank me.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.680
The man's a prisoner,
and it's up to us to get him out.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.345
We've checked the specs.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.016
There's no way into Quinn's compound

14:48.137 --> 14:49.684
without a large S.H.I.E.L.D. strike force.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.058
Or a man inside.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.643
He's got neodymium laser
fencing surrounding the property.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.437
They'll never
allow a strike force into Malta.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.238
Plus, this weekend Quinn Worldwide's

14:57.355 --> 14:59.073
got its annual shareholders' gathering.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.401
We'd risk global outrage. But...

15:01.484 --> 15:02.656
if we go in alone...

15:02.819 --> 15:04.366
S.H.I.E.L.D. can disavow us,
claim ignorance.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.782
Without a man inside,
it's impossible.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.992
Unless you're immune
to pulse laser emissions.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.785
If we had a monkey we could get in.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.211
Oh, Fitz!

15:12.328 --> 15:14.456
If we had a small monkey,
he could slip through the sensors

15:14.539 --> 15:15.916
and disable the fence's power source

15:16.040 --> 15:17.462
with his adorable little hands.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.714
I could go in.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.462
Drop me in the hills outside of Valletta.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.923
I'll spend a few weeks
establishing a cover, gathering intel...

15:23.005 --> 15:24.131
Hall doesn't have a few weeks.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.967
And to restate, any agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.723
caught on Maltese soil
can be shot to death with bullets.

15:27.844 --> 15:28.845
- Yeah.
-Legally.

15:28.970 --> 15:31.064
Not me. I could go in.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.557
Skye, this is serious.

15:32.682 --> 15:33.854
Wait.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.352
What are you saying?

15:36.477 --> 15:37.774
Well, I'm not an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.,

15:37.854 --> 15:40.073
so I can go in
without breaking all these stupid rules.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.357
International laws.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.530
This isn't something
the Rising Tide can hack, Skye.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.287
Did you hear the deadly lasers
part? Without a brave monkey...

15:46.362 --> 15:48.205
You said you could go in
with a man inside.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.453
And you wanna be that man?

15:50.199 --> 15:52.702
Fitz-Simmons love the guy,
and he needs help.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.704
They could be torturing him. Or worse,

15:54.829 --> 15:56.376
making him do strength training.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.379
But you don't have the background,

15:58.499 --> 16:01.048
or clearance,
or experience with any of this.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.469
I know.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.214
But I've got an invitation.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.057
Well, technically it's an e-vite.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.989
I understand your concern,
but we don't have a lot of options.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.486
Hey, I'm impressed.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.568
She just
wrangled an invitation on her phone

16:25.693 --> 16:28.492
using insider
back channel voodoo. In minutes.

16:28.571 --> 16:32.496
But sending her in with no
training, you're taking a huge risk.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.952
I know Director Fury felt he owed you

16:34.076 --> 16:35.498
after you sacrificed yourself...

16:35.578 --> 16:36.921
And my card collection.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.591
He gave you some autonomy.
But Skye on a covert op?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.543
Are you worried
about her safety or her loyalty?

16:42.752 --> 16:45.722
Both. The Rising Tide
is the reason she got an invite.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.340
Who knows
how many protocols she violated.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.767
That's her job. Ignore protocol,

16:49.884 --> 16:52.228
find connections and back
doors that nobody else can see.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.689
Something else is bothering you.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.942
She's holding back, sir.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.188
She says she wants to be an
agent, but she won't commit.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.114
She doesn't listen, makes jokes.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.449
Were you hard on her?

17:05.525 --> 17:07.948
Sure. I tried playing nice, too.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.616
I need a new strategy.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.040
Try no strategy.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.619
Stop thinking like
an operative, start thinking like a person.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.420
Maybe Skye will let that person help her.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.039
Help her what?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.625
Help her think like an operative.

17:24.042 --> 17:27.137
Now, again, slowly, what's first?

17:30.299 --> 17:31.300
And then?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.143
Then things are moving too quickly.

17:33.261 --> 17:36.231
I'm a proper Southern girl.
You'll make me untidy.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.650
Twist the thumb, palm the barrel.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.983
Ow.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.654
You're gonna die and leave us hanging
out to dry, you know that?

17:43.729 --> 17:45.072
You're going in
with no self-defense skills...

17:45.147 --> 17:46.239
I have a few tricks up my sleeve.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.985
You need muscle memory,
fundamentals,

17:49.068 --> 17:50.069
the tools to turn yourself...

17:50.152 --> 17:51.449
Into a whole bag of tools?

17:52.154 --> 17:53.280
How did you learn computer science

17:53.406 --> 17:54.498
without committing yourself to it?

17:54.782 --> 17:55.829
C.S. comes naturally to me.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.831
I'm sorry
I'm not naturally whatever you are.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.250
You think this came naturally?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.917
I had a brother
who beat the crap out of me.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.627
Me and my little brother.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.422
For nothing.
For eating a piece of his birthday cake.

18:09.505 --> 18:14.102
I had to learn to protect us, the way I
am trying to protect you.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.311
That was my moment.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.479
You asked.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.273
Sorry. Didn't mean to push.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.865
But I did manage to take this.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.452
Getting the gun is one thing.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.159
Pulling the trigger, that is another.

18:39.368 --> 18:43.464
Now, again, slowly. What's first?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.213
Skye will walk in the front door.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.136
The only external access point to
Quinn's underground facility

18:49.211 --> 18:50.713
is from a beach cove.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.058
A two-man extraction team
could slip in there, but it's not easy.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.472
Fitz-Simmons.

18:55.676 --> 19:00.307
The perimeter is surrounded by
a 20-foot-high neodymium laser grid.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.515
Touch it and you're toast.

19:01.724 --> 19:02.816
Dead toast.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.061
The only way to disable the grid is to

19:05.227 --> 19:07.195
crack the system and trigger a reboot.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.319
This would give the team
three seconds to cross.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.151
Of course, Quinn's too smart to allow

19:11.275 --> 19:12.743
any wireless access on his property.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.154
That's where I come in.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.659
Yes. Working compact.
Holds up under X-ray.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.997
Desert Rose, to match your
complexion. But, oh, what's this?

19:20.660 --> 19:21.832
A readout, okay?

19:21.911 --> 19:24.414
It turns green
if you're in close enough proximity

19:24.538 --> 19:26.586
to a computer to gain wireless access.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.668
And when it does,
you just drop this nearby and walk out.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.924
We'll do the rest. Easy as pie.

19:31.045 --> 19:33.764
Or it will be,
if you stick to the plan.

19:34.340 --> 19:38.265
Got it. Plan. Green. Drop. Walk. Pie.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.519
I don't wanna question your orders, sir.

19:42.765 --> 19:43.937
Good.

19:44.392 --> 19:48.022
But I've already seen far more
combat than I bargained for.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.027
This two-man extraction team?

19:50.106 --> 19:52.700
That's exactly
the kind of action I was hoping to avoid.

19:52.775 --> 19:53.901
That's why you're not on it.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.697
Specialist work is different
from field work, believe me.

19:57.780 --> 19:58.872
When was the last time you...

19:58.948 --> 20:00.871
Hall's one of ours and he's in trouble.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.123
I need two men
to get him out. Ward makes one.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.050
So that's why I'm going in.

20:10.126 --> 20:13.130
You forget,
I saw plenty of action with the Avengers.

20:15.798 --> 20:16.890
And you died.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.060
All right, team. Suit up.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.290
Thank you.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.836
Hors d'oeuvre, madame?

20:54.503 --> 20:55.595
Who are you?

20:56.839 --> 20:59.638
Apologies for his manners. He
knows very little English.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.267
Oh. That's... Whatever. Skye.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.353
Qasim Zaghlul.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.103
Big fan. You built half of
Dubai, including the Arabian Blade.

21:10.519 --> 21:14.649
I love that building.
It's super sci-fi. Where's your wife?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.032
Wife's name's Nadrah.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.155
Nadrah.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.323
Twin sons.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.778
She's staying at home with the boys?

21:19.862 --> 21:20.909
You know Nadrah?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.490
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.126
The pleasure is mine.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.296
I could get used to
this, people. It's like Siri, if it worked.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.376
Skipper to Bravo, I got eyes on Top Dog.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.211
The Eagle is landing on it.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.634
What are you doing?

21:37.713 --> 21:41.388
Sorry. I don't know.
I see Quinn. I'm gonna go talk to him.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.684
I mean, that,
and its effect on the Industrial Average.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.227
- That was good.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.900
Yeah, right? Ian Quinn.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.149
I'm your last-minute party crasher. Skye.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.151
Oh.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.323
Wow.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.401
Great to meet you.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.532
This is Skye,
a member of the Rising Tide.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.363
They're a group of hackers

22:02.488 --> 22:04.411
that have gotten
some pretty big secrets out to the public.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.584
I prefer "hacktivist".
I'm glad you've heard of our site.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.499
I read it. We think very much alike.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.579
More freedom of information,

22:10.704 --> 22:12.172
the less government
infringing on everyone's rights.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.340
I'm a fan.

22:13.415 --> 22:16.669
That explains the invite.
This is a tough party to get into.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.013
Not as hard to get into
as the encrypted back channel

22:19.088 --> 22:22.513
you contacted us through
to request the invite.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.934
That's sort of where I live.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.437
You gotta show me
how you did that. I mean, if you sign on.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.356
Sign what now?

22:30.432 --> 22:33.185
I've been known to
turn a few black hats into white hats.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.612
Not just for vulnerability analysis,

22:34.728 --> 22:36.071
but for very creative thinking.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.774
Are you offering me a job?

22:39.108 --> 22:40.860
Well, I didn't
invite you here for your pretty face.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.617
I didn't know you had a pretty face.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.575
Yes, I wanna hire you,
before someone else snatches you up.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.079
That seemed to go well.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.212
- Yeah. It did.

22:54.039 --> 22:57.885
Many of you shareholders
have been with us for years,

22:58.294 --> 22:59.386
and I see a few new names here.

22:59.753 --> 23:03.474
But I wanna thank you all for traveling so
far to this beautiful country.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.310
And, well, for slumming it
at Shaba Tal-Banar.

23:08.971 --> 23:13.568
This country, where we are allowed
to pursue progress and profit

23:14.560 --> 23:16.403
without the stranglehold of regulations

23:16.520 --> 23:18.318
that are now choking our world.

23:19.481 --> 23:24.487
The United States Government,
the E.U., the D.R.T.C., S.H.I.E.L.D.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.580
These are just a few
of the institutions that are guilty

23:26.655 --> 23:29.829
of halting the development
of new technology

23:29.950 --> 23:32.669
for anyone except themselves.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.919
We dare defy them with a new idea,

23:35.998 --> 23:39.002
they steal in
and sweep it out from under us.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.795
But not today.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.921
You are all aware

23:42.004 --> 23:43.005
of what Quinn Worldwide has been

23:43.088 --> 23:44.135
able to do with basic minerals,

23:44.381 --> 23:46.850
let alone uranium or plutonium,

23:47.259 --> 23:49.637
despite these unjust restrictions

23:49.720 --> 23:52.690
that weigh the scales
in the other guys' favor.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.985
Well, today
I'm announcing something new.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.030
An element that could
balance those scales.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.485
And I mean that quite literally.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.444
Imagine if you could control gravity.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.781
If instead of
drilling for oil, it rose up to greet you.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.451
Imagine if you could move
a supertanker's worth of cargo

24:11.533 --> 24:12.955
with a swipe of your hand.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.125
Well, we will do this and more.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.504
This could've been
a traumatic experience for Dr. Hall.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.298
He may not be the same
when we find him, Ward.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.594
I'll talk him down.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.923
We don't want
your personality to set him on edge.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.008
Great time for humor, sir.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.718
My people skills
are the least of our problems

24:28.801 --> 24:30.223
if Skye can't get us in.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.653
It's locked, but there's no lock.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.781
Check for a keypad.

24:45.776 --> 24:48.074
Nothing. Wait, you can hack a keypad?

24:48.237 --> 24:49.659
No, not over the phone.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.407
Is there a reception desk?

24:53.158 --> 24:54.250
Okay, yeah.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.921
Well, now what do I do?

24:58.831 --> 25:00.083
What are you trying to do?

25:02.584 --> 25:06.930
Just looking for a pen,
here we go.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.681
Got to write down all those good
ideas, you know what I mean?

25:10.759 --> 25:11.806
Of course you know what I mean.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.183
You probably have, like,
10 pens for all your ideas.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.432
What are you really doing?

25:19.893 --> 25:21.736
All right. I'm busted.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.736
I was trying to
get a glimpse behind your office door,

25:24.815 --> 25:25.907
see how things really operate.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.701
I invite you here as a guest,

25:27.776 --> 25:30.871
and you treat me
like another corrupt institution,

25:30.946 --> 25:32.948
looking for trade secrets to leak online.

25:33.574 --> 25:34.826
- Security...
-No, no, no, wait.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.338
It's just, with all these la-di-da
people, you have to be so guarded.

25:39.413 --> 25:40.881
So careful.

25:42.249 --> 25:46.629
What you say, what secrets you reveal.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.300
And I was hoping that you and I

25:52.926 --> 25:54.143
could be honest with one another.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.065
If you know what I mean.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.653
My office had
less space, more wheels.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.660
Wow. A view of the ocean and the pool.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.158
Not a bad place to do business.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.495
Got the dispatch
leaking Hall's location. User's an alias.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.579
Oh! Can you trace the D.H.C.P. server...

26:20.662 --> 26:23.506
Trace is running,
but it'll take time. Our girl?

26:23.582 --> 26:24.583
I thought she was done for,

26:24.666 --> 26:26.259
but she's just
sweet-talked her way into Quinn's office.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.632
How'd she manage that?

26:27.836 --> 26:30.009
She probably
just used her, um...

26:33.801 --> 26:34.802
...boobs.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.933
Ugh! That's the only...

26:38.222 --> 26:41.066
Oh, my gosh, the signal's dead. Fitz!

26:41.350 --> 26:44.945
I didn't. She must have... Oh, Lord.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.192
Much better.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.194
I haven't felt that someone's-
watching-my-every-move feeling

26:52.277 --> 26:54.120
since I failed my driver's test.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.699
Do you wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

26:56.782 --> 26:58.204
S.H.I.E.L.D. got to you?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.667
They picked me up in L.A.,

26:59.952 --> 27:03.297
I helped them in
a crisis, and now they wanna recruit me.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.547
Of course they did.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.715
So I played along.

27:05.999 --> 27:10.220
Talk about inside info.
I have a bunk on their plane.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.634
I've been gathering intel, biding my
time until I could become useful.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.222
I thought this qualified.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.396
Why would they trust you
with a covert operation like this?

27:19.680 --> 27:22.559
Something about S.H.I.E.L.D. not
breaking international laws.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.018
They had no other options.

27:24.893 --> 27:28.898
Whereas I like to keep mine open.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.332
Next patrol any minute now.

27:43.579 --> 27:47.083
Skye's offline.
Repeat, we've lost audio and vitals.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.589
Abort is not an option,
but if she's compromised...

27:49.710 --> 27:51.257
She's still our only way in
to get to Dr. Hall.

27:51.545 --> 27:52.762
And we're their only way out.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.594
The beach is all clear.
Let's move up the ridge.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.394
You're saying they wanted to rope me in

27:59.511 --> 28:01.013
because I pose a genuine threat?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.898
Yes. And fit their profile.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.438
- Profile?
-Sure.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.527
You're a criminal,
you have a warrant somewhere.

28:07.603 --> 28:08.604
Probably.

28:08.729 --> 28:09.855
Specialized skill set.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.191
I try to stay humble, but fail.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.033
No family.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.790
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit a nerve.

28:19.907 --> 28:23.036
But that is what
these people do. S.H.I.E.L.D.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.960
They prey on fear,
and loneliness, and desperation,

28:27.080 --> 28:30.960
and they offer a home
to those who have no one else to turn to.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.093
But I can offer you something better.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.905
Damn! A little rusty, I guess.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.986
Guys, clock's ticking. Where's Skye?

28:57.110 --> 29:00.284
You stay with us, there's no
secrets, no lies and no agenda.

29:00.614 --> 29:03.333
You're free to do what you do

29:03.450 --> 29:05.418
without Big Brother watching over you.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.458
But first

29:08.830 --> 29:10.707
you have to tell me exactly what agenda

29:10.832 --> 29:12.755
S.H.I.E.L.D. sent you in here with.

29:13.835 --> 29:18.511
Well, they wanted me
to do whatever it takes to get in here.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.354
Get in here and...

29:28.767 --> 29:29.814
Bat my eyes.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.821
Get you talking.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.691
- We're in!
-She's done it!

29:35.816 --> 29:36.863
Fitz, you're up.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.365
Oh, mother of all things.
Move, move, move!

29:42.531 --> 29:44.625
We have a man
down. Hostiles on the east ridge.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.376
We need a reset here, Fitz.

29:52.708 --> 29:53.709
Fitz!

29:53.834 --> 29:56.132
Saying his name repeatedly does
not increase productivity.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.303
Okay, go.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.631
Or maybe it does.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.971
System rebooting in two, one...

30:02.175 --> 30:03.222
NOW!

30:11.893 --> 30:13.486
I'll look for Dr. Hall down in the lab.

30:13.562 --> 30:14.688
I'll get Skye.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.033
No, you can't be the only angle.

30:18.317 --> 30:22.038
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s thorough enough to know
about me and my exploits.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.365
It takes more
than a pretty face to disarm me.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.579
Sir, we have a security breach.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.169
Oh, the timing on that was perfect.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.763
Dr. Hall? Agent Coulson.
We have an exit strategy.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.094
S.H.I.E.L.D.?

30:45.177 --> 30:46.303
Yes, sir. Let's get you out of here.

30:46.386 --> 30:50.141
I'm sorry, Mr. Coulson.
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

30:51.641 --> 30:52.688
I'll be honest.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.772
Our strategy did not
take into consideration you saying that.

31:01.485 --> 31:02.782
Oh, no.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.704
Look, I don't know
what Quinn is promising you, but...

31:04.780 --> 31:05.872
- An opportunity.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.121
We can't let Quinn
have control of this. It's too dangerous.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.964
We can't let anyone
have control of this. That's why I'm here.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.635
To bury it at
the bottom of the ocean. With him.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.099
Coulson. The leak came from...

31:25.175 --> 31:26.973
Dr. Hall. Yeah, I'm getting that.

31:27.427 --> 31:31.557
All the petitions, embargoes in the
world couldn't stop Ian.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.108
He grows more powerful every day.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.936
And then I get word he's found this.

31:41.066 --> 31:44.570
I'm sorry, Mr. Coulson.
I had to make a choice.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.200
Something tells me
that wasn't the off button.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.171
Guys, we need to talk.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.754
Lost you for a minute.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.305
We're aware of the problem, sir.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.890
Hall wanted Quinn to kidnap him?

32:05.006 --> 32:06.098
Yeah, why would he do that?

32:06.174 --> 32:07.221
What is wrong with him?

32:07.426 --> 32:09.269
Quinn built a gravity generator.

32:09.386 --> 32:11.263
Like the one we found but bigger.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.065
Hall knew Quinn would
need him to control its raw power.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.484
But Hall just wanted to unleash it.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.732
The one we found was 2.5 centimeters

32:17.853 --> 32:20.072
in diameter. It stopped a semi.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.691
How big are we talking?

32:21.773 --> 32:24.777
Twelve feet. It'll definitely take
down the entire compound.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.778
- It'll sink the place.
-No, it'll do more than that.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.489
Work a solution.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.666
I'll disconnect the power
before things get...

32:31.950 --> 32:33.372
crazy.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.628
They can't help you.

32:42.586 --> 32:47.308
Soon it'll reach
an exponential acceleration state.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.928
I'm sorry.

32:54.514 --> 32:57.358
My team's here. Good people.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.402
Sworn to protect all mankind?

33:00.353 --> 33:02.731
That's what I'm doing, I promise.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.780
Making things right.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.002
Don't you get it?

33:20.207 --> 33:21.959
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s against
everything you stand for.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.592
They're Big Brother.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.179
Maybe. But they're the nice big brother

33:26.254 --> 33:27.927
who stands up
for his helpless little brother

33:28.048 --> 33:29.550
who was getting beat up because

33:29.674 --> 33:31.221
he ate a piece of cake that he wasn't...

33:32.719 --> 33:35.017
You know... You kidnapped a person!

33:35.096 --> 33:36.097
I set him free!

33:36.848 --> 33:37.895
I saved him!

33:39.559 --> 33:40.731
And I could've saved you.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.902
This place is massive.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.736
Where am I heading?

33:45.899 --> 33:47.025
Southwest corner.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.281
Ward, tell me
you've got things covered on the ground.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.245
I can't do a damn thing from out here.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.785
I'm working on it.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.457
Tell me what they're doing!

34:00.580 --> 34:02.082
Tell me what they're doing.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.878
You have to talk.
You have no other way out of this.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.847
You're expendable to S.H.I.E.L.D.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.637
They sent you in here with nothing...

34:14.135 --> 34:15.306
They taught me a few things.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.397
The kid's got balls.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.312
Thanks. But, yuck.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.770
But do you have what it takes
to pull the trigger?

34:25.813 --> 34:26.815
Nope.

34:32.821 --> 34:33.913
Get her.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.087
Hall. We have to evacuate.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.763
Get the chopper. Now!

34:58.930 --> 35:03.276
All I had to do to get access to Quinn's
lab was drop little clues,

35:03.852 --> 35:05.695
create a puzzle for him to solve.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.152
Quinn likes to feel smart.

35:08.356 --> 35:11.200
So you leaked your location.
Why not try reasoning with him?

35:11.276 --> 35:13.119
You can't reason with an addict.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.538
And he's addicted
to exploiting opportunities.

35:16.197 --> 35:20.043
But he never gives
a thought to the friends, ecosystems,

35:20.160 --> 35:22.709
future generations
left ruined in his wake.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.833
Like Agents Fitz and Simmons?
Your former students?

35:26.791 --> 35:28.384
I've got them in my ear right now,

35:28.501 --> 35:30.048
telling me you're not a bad guy.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.387
We could've worked with you on this.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.725
S.H.I.E.L.D.? S.H.I.E.L.D.
is just as guilty of the same thing!

35:40.388 --> 35:43.392
Experimentation
without thought of consequence!

35:44.392 --> 35:48.647
Your search for an unlimited power
source brought an alien invasion.

35:49.648 --> 35:50.740
Fair point.

35:52.484 --> 35:56.409
This element is far too powerful for you,

35:56.529 --> 35:58.702
for him, for anyone.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.502
But I don't have
to tell you that. You're feeling it now.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.060
Come here.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.892
No, no, please, please.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.292
Are you hurt?

36:47.122 --> 36:49.466
Just follow my orders.
I'll get us out of here.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.141
I see the future,
Mr. Coulson, and it's a catastrophe.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.652
I just see a lot of people in trouble.

37:11.771 --> 37:15.617
Nothing. Fitz-Simmons'?
I tried to cut the power. It's still going.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.657
- You need to find a catalyst.
-Find some sort of catalyst.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.072
Something to
create a chemical reaction in the core.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.749
It's not too late to do the right
thing. Help me find a catalyst...

37:22.824 --> 37:24.826
lam doing the right thing.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.669
A completely selfless act.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.589
I know that history
never celebrates what didn't happen.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.837
They'll call this a tragedy.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.844
They won't understand
the good I did here.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.009
Killing innocent people?

37:38.298 --> 37:39.675
Saving millions.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.849
We have to live
with the choices we make.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.807
But sometimes
we have to die with them, too.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.768
I understand.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.108
You made a hard call.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.982
Yes.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.609
Now I have to make mine.

38:36.856 --> 38:37.903
Say it back to me.

38:38.024 --> 38:41.244
Deepest level of the Fridge.
Unmarked vault. No access granted.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.988
And no recorded entry.

38:43.071 --> 38:45.415
I don't want it listed,
I don't want it flagged for The Slingshot.

38:46.407 --> 38:50.253
Anyone finds out, you're
responsible. And suffering. Understood?

38:50.537 --> 38:51.584
Yes, sir.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.920
It's what Hall would've wanted.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.049
I used to have this down.

38:59.712 --> 39:02.431
Should be just muscle memory.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.009
You're making a habit of it, sir.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.184
Trying.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.103
I guess I'm a little rusty.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.273
Of these close calls, I mean.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.350
I don't enjoy running back end.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.437
You want off the plane? Go ahead.

39:18.940 --> 39:19.941
I want in.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.446
Reporting for combat, next time it's up.

39:25.572 --> 39:28.951
You're committed to the cause,
or just watching my back?

39:30.118 --> 39:31.415
Same thing.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.713
And you are a little rusty.

39:54.976 --> 39:58.731
You and your brothers.
Where'd you grow up'?

39:59.898 --> 40:01.821
Massachusetts. Mostly.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.159
A house?

40:04.903 --> 40:05.950
You didn't?

40:09.741 --> 40:11.288
One house.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.086
The Brodys.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.842
I was nine.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.846
They sent me
back to Saint Agnes after a month.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.306
Said I wasn't a good fit.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.638
Foster parents.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.349
Your first?

40:35.350 --> 40:36.693
My third.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.483
I had heard it before but...

40:42.190 --> 40:43.783
this one was different.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.119
'Cause you wanted them to like you.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.457
Bad.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.707
I called her "mom" once.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.294
Tried it out.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.223
Guess it wasn't a good fit.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.556
Hoping for something and losing it

41:14.681 --> 41:17.525
hurts more than
never hoping for anything.

41:20.895 --> 41:21.942
We won't turn our back.

41:22.063 --> 41:23.280
Doesn't matter.

41:24.232 --> 41:28.362
I made my choice. And I want this. Bad.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.584
And I know there's a truth serum.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.204
Whatever you say, rookie.
