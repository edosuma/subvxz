02:36.667 --> 02:38.082
In the final years
of the Ming dynasty,

02:38.083 --> 02:40.495
disorder was rife and
the eunuchs held great power.

02:41.250 --> 02:45.573
Crane of eastern depot
was the wickest of them all.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.957
Meanwhile, the Bruneian empire,
a diplomatic ally,

02:49.500 --> 02:52.788
gifted a black furred
beast to the emperor.

02:53.917 --> 02:58.832
However, crane took possession of the
monster with sinister intentions in mind.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.365
Silence!

03:37.042 --> 03:38.373
Chain his majesty's beast.

03:56.625 --> 03:57.740
It hurts...

04:17.833 --> 04:18.833
Ocean.

04:30.958 --> 04:33.290
This toy is ferocious by nature.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.871
It'll become a killer
with a little training.

04:40.625 --> 04:42.456
It needs to fear you

04:42.917 --> 04:44.828
so that it'll obey you.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.536
As the animal tamer
of the imperial spy,

06:07.750 --> 06:09.786
I've seen beasts of all kinds.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.995
But this little monster
is adorable by nature.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.992
My conscience won't let me
turn it into a weapon.

06:24.167 --> 06:26.704
Get my monster back!

06:27.542 --> 06:29.407
And bring ocean back, too!

06:31.833 --> 06:34.495
Whoever gets the black monster alive

06:34.625 --> 06:36.707
shall receive 30,000
taels of silver!

06:49.750 --> 06:54.289
This sent the martial world
into a hunting frenzy.

06:56.708 --> 07:00.405
"Look to the heavens.
The higher it is,"

07:00.875 --> 07:03.416
"the smaller the people seem."

07:03.417 --> 07:05.041
"The learned priest"

07:05.042 --> 07:08.955
"for fame and power,
we restrain ourselves in borders."

07:09.167 --> 07:10.791
"We've lost too much and
gained too little."

07:10.792 --> 07:11.872
"The Seductive Swordswoman"

07:13.417 --> 07:16.916
"it's easy to speak
of love and loyalty."

07:16.917 --> 07:17.874
"The Woody monk"

07:17.875 --> 07:20.912
"it's important to have actions
to back up those words."

07:21.833 --> 07:24.874
"Goodness and villainy are hard to
foresee in both human and beasts."

07:24.875 --> 07:25.957
"The flirtatious nun"

07:25.958 --> 07:29.280
"a split second is all it takes
for evil to overcome."

07:30.125 --> 07:31.082
"Just have a drink"

07:31.083 --> 07:31.999
"lord of the beggars"

07:32.000 --> 07:33.115
"and enjoy life."

07:36.000 --> 07:38.992
We've been fighting endlessly
over this monster.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.116
Why don't we talk it out?

07:41.292 --> 07:43.453
You said the same thing yesterday,

07:43.875 --> 07:44.707
then you stabbed me in the back!

07:44.708 --> 07:47.950
We agreed to split up into turfs,

07:48.167 --> 07:49.373
then you stepped into mine!

07:49.542 --> 07:51.248
That's enough. Why hurt each other?

07:51.375 --> 07:52.874
You're the one that
killed my deputy,

07:52.875 --> 07:55.537
now you want to be a pacifist,
you old spinster?

07:56.208 --> 07:58.164
What? I'm still young.

07:58.292 --> 08:01.489
Besides, he deserved to
die for being a lecher!

08:01.625 --> 08:03.331
If lechers deserve to die,

08:03.500 --> 08:06.832
then what about you and the monk?

08:06.833 --> 08:09.324
How dare you steal the nun from
me, Baldie!

08:09.958 --> 08:12.040
I'd always known that you're a slut!

08:12.208 --> 08:14.449
You said yesterday that
you're in love with me.

08:14.708 --> 08:15.708
So what?!

08:16.000 --> 08:18.499
You want a beggar? Don't
you have any taste?

08:18.500 --> 08:21.287
What about you?! I thought
you loved only me.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.831
What's with you and pinky?

08:25.375 --> 08:26.416
Outta my way, all of you!

08:26.417 --> 08:27.416
You jackasses!

08:27.417 --> 08:29.582
Stay back or I'll unleash hell!
I'll stab yal!

08:29.583 --> 08:31.783
You're going to be in a
world of pain. I'll stab ya!

08:39.500 --> 08:42.332
Stop chasing me, damn you!

08:44.625 --> 08:45.625
Stay back!

08:54.500 --> 08:56.624
Boss, why aren't we in the fight?

08:56.625 --> 08:57.990
They're fighting for real, man.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.832
What are you eating?
A bun.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.833
Where's mine?

09:04.417 --> 09:05.577
I forgot to save one for you.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.375
Forget it, then.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.243
You prick!

09:14.542 --> 09:17.784
This is dangerous.
Why don't we just leave?

09:18.167 --> 09:20.123
We're the south Sichuan bandits.

09:20.292 --> 09:21.332
If we just up and leave...

09:22.625 --> 09:23.625
It'll be embarrassing.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.787
It is if everyone sees us leave.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.116
It won't be if we leave quietly.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.583
You're right.

09:33.042 --> 09:34.498
Why are you still after me?!

09:34.792 --> 09:35.622
Help!

09:35.792 --> 09:38.829
Why are you chasing me?! Help!

09:57.792 --> 09:58.792
I'm getting dizzy!

10:05.583 --> 10:07.499
We're all dead if we don't back off.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.457
Then back off.
Forget this. Let go of my foot.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.858
Why can't you all back down first?!

10:13.375 --> 10:15.416
Look, we'll all back down
on the count of three.

10:15.417 --> 10:16.122
Fine.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.032
One, two, three.

10:23.458 --> 10:24.948
You despicable jerks...

10:36.250 --> 10:37.786
Boss, he has a bun!

10:37.958 --> 10:38.958
Where?

10:41.583 --> 10:42.663
This is mine for sure.

10:43.167 --> 10:45.328
Don't steal from the dead.
Give that back.

10:45.958 --> 10:47.289
I want to eat it.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.081
You're still alive?!

10:49.292 --> 10:50.623
I didn't say that.

10:53.667 --> 10:54.707
What the hell was that?!

10:54.708 --> 10:56.824
He jinxed himself to death, boss.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.911
Sorry, man,
you can have the bun back.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.916
Have it on the road
to the afterlife.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.282
Bless you.

11:03.083 --> 11:06.041
Sorry, man, I'll leave you half.

11:06.042 --> 11:07.998
Put that down.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.869
Saucy!

11:56.167 --> 11:56.916
It's a monster!

11:56.917 --> 11:58.457
I'm sure I'm better
looking than that.

11:58.458 --> 11:59.938
It's like a lion
with its mouth open.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.624
Beware of thieves in the night!

12:08.625 --> 12:09.660
Stop hollering.

12:09.917 --> 12:12.454
I hear the flying thief
showed up here last month.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.749
The killer of all the
watchmen is at large.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.706
Aren't you scared?

12:17.417 --> 12:18.332
Of what?

12:18.333 --> 12:20.039
We're watchmen upholding justice.

12:21.042 --> 12:22.874
Lightning doesn't strike
in the same place twice, right?

12:22.875 --> 12:23.875
True.

12:26.583 --> 12:27.583
Was that lightning?

12:28.542 --> 12:29.542
Maybe.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.277
Did you hear that noise behind us?

12:31.792 --> 12:32.792
Should we keep hollering?

12:33.042 --> 12:34.041
No way. Just keep moving.

12:34.042 --> 12:34.791
Move along quietly.

12:34.792 --> 12:37.499
I see nothing in the dead of night.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.615
Then why are you hollering?

12:46.708 --> 12:49.074
This family is supposed to
be wealthy. What's all this?

12:49.208 --> 12:50.243
I like this.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.490
This is nice.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.082
This is huge!
What do you need that for?

12:55.083 --> 12:56.323
I want this!

12:57.333 --> 12:58.038
Who is it?

12:58.333 --> 12:58.992
Someone from your destiny.

12:59.125 --> 13:00.332
What destiny?

13:00.333 --> 13:01.332
Who do you think you are?

13:01.333 --> 13:02.573
You trying to Rob the robbers?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.035
Catch up, Bella.

13:14.292 --> 13:16.658
I'm afraid of heights, blade.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.664
I should stick to the ground.

13:21.292 --> 13:23.374
You managed to keep up with me.
Not bad.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.291
You screwed up our payday.

13:26.292 --> 13:29.082
What kind of pay do you expect
from a place like this?

13:29.083 --> 13:31.916
I have a real heist for you,
if you two are interested.

13:32.750 --> 13:33.865
What kind of heist?

13:34.042 --> 13:35.624
Don't listen to her, blade.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.162
30,000 taels of silver.
How's that sound?

13:40.542 --> 13:41.542
Sounds great.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.031
See you tomorrow at Huatian
courier station after sundown.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.493
These are the code words.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.912
See you there. My name is blade.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.490
That's Bella, a fellow disciple.

13:50.875 --> 13:53.116
We lead the Sichuan-Shaanxi
chapter of the Guiyi army.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.332
Wait, miss, what's your name?

13:57.333 --> 13:58.573
Frigid.

13:58.875 --> 13:59.910
Frigid?

14:00.958 --> 14:03.082
There's definitely
something fishy about her.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.749
Look at that white get-up,
pretending to be pure.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.332
Aren't you afraid
that she's a swindler?

14:07.333 --> 14:10.951
The army is in danger.
We have to take the risk.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.666
Shut your traps, you damn mutts!

14:13.667 --> 14:15.874
You lookin' for a beating?!

14:16.208 --> 14:17.618
I'll smash you with my stinkpot!

14:21.625 --> 14:24.207
The smoky place up
ahead is Zhu village.

14:24.875 --> 14:29.039
A wild fire wiped it
out a few days ago.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.039
The smoke still
hasn't dissipated yet.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.583
We can ward off natural disasters,
but not man-made ones.

14:34.875 --> 14:39.494
You know what to do if
you see a troublemaker.

14:39.750 --> 14:40.874
Execution on the spot.

14:40.875 --> 14:41.455
My lord,

14:41.583 --> 14:44.871
the monster hunters
we recruited have been wiped out.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.490
Why are you laughing, my lord?

14:49.167 --> 14:53.160
These so-called martial artists
fight day and night.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.286
They're a potential
danger to the throne.

14:55.667 --> 14:59.455
I used this so-called monster
hunt to lure them out

14:59.833 --> 15:03.332
and let them slaughter
one another over money.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.039
I didn't even have to lift a finger.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.495
Now do you know why I'm laughing?

15:08.917 --> 15:10.124
That's brilliant, my lord!

15:10.125 --> 15:11.831
Brilliant, indeed, my lord!

15:12.167 --> 15:13.577
My lord has such a perceptive mind.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.374
My lord's powers are almost godly.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.375
My lord...

15:16.958 --> 15:18.619
That's enough flattery from you.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.991
Though it feels good
to be flattered...

15:23.500 --> 15:25.616
Constable Wang from west
Sichuan has a message.

15:25.917 --> 15:27.657
He says that he's captured ocean.

15:27.792 --> 15:30.704
They'll spend a night at Huatian
on the way to Jianzhou.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.912
How far away is Huatian from here?

15:34.083 --> 15:36.950
About 25 kilometers, my lord.

15:37.167 --> 15:41.160
But the mountainous path is
quite rugged. I suggest...

15:42.292 --> 15:45.580
I don't want to risk anything.
We're going to Huatian now.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yes, my lord!

15:47.208 --> 15:49.665
We're off!

16:05.375 --> 16:07.036
Boss, I'm hungry again.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.375
Hey!

16:08.542 --> 16:10.624
You've eaten everything.
I'm the starving one here!

16:10.625 --> 16:13.822
I'm hungry coz I've eaten.
You don't starve if you don't eat.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.916
You haven't eaten a
thing, and you're fine.

16:15.917 --> 16:16.917
You're ridiculous.

16:17.125 --> 16:19.124
Why don't we beg for some food?

16:19.125 --> 16:22.457
We're proper martial artists.
You expect me to beg for food?

16:22.458 --> 16:23.823
Are you shameless or what?

16:24.333 --> 16:26.197
Wait... Here, take this.

16:26.458 --> 16:27.332
Keep your filthy hands off me.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.653
Don't fight.
I've got nothing.

16:29.167 --> 16:31.249
I'm a civilized man.
Don't provoke me.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.082
Your fleas are hopping over.
Here, have some.

16:34.417 --> 16:35.791
I'll beat the next
person that touches me!

16:35.792 --> 16:37.032
Go over there.
Don't fight.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.125
What's wrong?!

16:39.250 --> 16:42.208
Please give me some food.
I'm starving!

16:43.000 --> 16:44.082
Don't bite!
Give it to him!

16:44.083 --> 16:45.582
Let me see if I have more.
Hurry, Bella.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.790
This is my last piece of bread.
Take it.

16:47.917 --> 16:48.624
Let's go.
I'm all out.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.411
Thank you, sir. Thank you, miss.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.541
You really will do
anything for food, boss.

16:53.542 --> 16:55.582
Shut up!
I had to beg because of you.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.993
Can you smell that, boss?

16:59.292 --> 17:00.291
What's wrong? Is it poisoned?

17:00.292 --> 17:01.292
There's meat.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.573
I don't see any.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.198
That guy has meat on him.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.082
They definitely have meat.

17:08.083 --> 17:11.371
Just a crummy piece of bread?
That's insulting, boss.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.330
It's so windy here.

17:33.833 --> 17:34.833
Watch out for traps.

17:57.417 --> 17:58.874
Women are better at talking. Go on.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.160
Me again?

18:00.625 --> 18:01.956
Who are you?!

18:02.667 --> 18:05.204
It's just an old man.

18:08.583 --> 18:11.120
Who knows when the
lovers will reunite.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.199
In this very moment...

18:15.458 --> 18:16.914
Sorrow is what I feel.

18:17.875 --> 18:18.875
Brother.

18:19.042 --> 18:20.042
Old man.

18:23.792 --> 18:26.249
Jeez, I feel sorrow
looking at you two.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.992
It's just a secret code.
You don't have to be so into it.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.041
Don't move. This is a robbery!

18:31.042 --> 18:33.033
Give me the meat from your pack!

18:33.583 --> 18:34.368
Don't move!

18:34.583 --> 18:35.832
Aren't you the guy that bit me?

18:35.833 --> 18:37.243
That was me. So what?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.454
How dare you give me bread
when you have meat?!

18:42.125 --> 18:44.124
Guys, unless you have
pressing matters,

18:44.125 --> 18:47.162
I suggest you leave before
you get in trouble.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.828
You little pissant...

18:50.042 --> 18:51.042
1...
Boss.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.250
Boss!

18:56.958 --> 18:57.958
Fine.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.867
I'll show you what
getting in trouble is.

19:04.333 --> 19:05.333
Go, saucy!

19:05.625 --> 19:06.660
Go, old man!

19:13.167 --> 19:15.203
Mr. mount, this is blade,

19:15.333 --> 19:17.133
the leader of the
Sichuan-Shaanxi Guiyi army.

19:17.292 --> 19:19.041
Behind him is his fellow
warrior, Bella.

19:19.042 --> 19:22.910
This is Mr. mount,
known for his lethal triple moves.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.499
Who are these two weirdos?

19:25.500 --> 19:27.666
I'm dash, leader of the
south Sichuan bandits.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.249
I'm second-in-command.
Don't mess with me!

19:29.250 --> 19:30.291
Cut the crap.

19:30.292 --> 19:33.041
We should eliminate
these thieves once and for all!

19:33.042 --> 19:34.042
Stop!

19:35.375 --> 19:36.490
They should join us.

19:36.833 --> 19:37.953
The more people, the better.

19:50.417 --> 19:53.457
Soon, constable Wang and his men

19:53.458 --> 19:56.871
will pass by this place.
That's when we'll ambush them

19:57.292 --> 20:00.204
and steal the 30,000 taels
of silver. Any comment?

20:00.333 --> 20:01.707
You're gorgeous.
Boss,

20:01.708 --> 20:03.999
isn't stealing imperial silver
punishable by death?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.457
We can't lose our heads!

20:06.458 --> 20:09.120
If you back out now, you die anyway.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.081
Looks like we're in, boss.
Miss frigid,

20:12.917 --> 20:14.327
I'm not being petty,

20:14.708 --> 20:17.165
but we're here to raise money
for the Guiyi army.

20:17.292 --> 20:20.034
The fewer silver we get,
the less help the army gets.

20:20.458 --> 20:23.624
This silver can make
or break the army.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.367
How do I know
you're really giving it to the army?

20:26.542 --> 20:27.907
Why, you...
He's right.

20:28.042 --> 20:31.159
Anyone would come up
with some grand tale for the silver.

20:31.625 --> 20:34.499
I won't let you insult
the great leader of our army!

20:34.500 --> 20:36.536
Don't force my hand. And you!

20:36.750 --> 20:39.492
Insult each other all you want.
I just want 30% of the loot.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.411
If that old man can take 30%,

20:41.625 --> 20:43.374
then each of us
deserves at least 10%!

20:43.375 --> 20:45.866
Already splitting the loot
before we know how to steal it.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.243
What's wrong with that?

20:47.750 --> 20:50.082
You're all talk. Tell us how
you plan to steal the silver!

20:51.042 --> 20:52.498
Get the meat, Bella.

20:55.833 --> 20:58.415
I told you she has meat
in that pack, boss.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.825
The meat is spiked.
You feel like getting drugged?

21:02.208 --> 21:03.999
We should probably leave that
to someone who needs sleep.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.541
I think you could use some sleep.
Try it.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.453
We can't just take
the silver by force.

21:08.792 --> 21:12.239
As long as we can get this meat
into the soldiers' mouths,

21:12.500 --> 21:15.041
then the silver is as good as ours.

21:15.042 --> 21:16.957
A heist plan straight
from water margins.

21:16.958 --> 21:17.958
Slut!

21:18.125 --> 21:19.535
Aren't I clever, Bella?

21:19.917 --> 21:22.659
But how can you be sure that
they'll eat the meat?

21:23.458 --> 21:26.245
If there are many of them,
how do we split it?

21:26.458 --> 21:28.449
What if there are
vegetarians among them?

21:28.625 --> 21:31.749
What if they're not hungry?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.741
How dare you question blade?!

21:34.167 --> 21:35.457
He did it.

21:35.458 --> 21:36.994
This one.
Over there.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.207
She did it.

21:38.208 --> 21:38.832
He did it.

21:38.833 --> 21:39.833
She did it.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.240
He did it.
This one.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.493
I'm out of breath.

22:24.583 --> 22:29.499
I'm the great monk's reincarnation.
Just passing through.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.791
Passing through? More like falling!

22:31.792 --> 22:32.832
Get him, saucy!

22:32.833 --> 22:33.833
Wait!

22:34.083 --> 22:35.249
No, look...

22:35.250 --> 22:36.457
It's an imperial decree
plaque, frigid.

22:36.458 --> 22:37.458
No, I mean...

22:37.917 --> 22:39.917
I picked it...
A member of the imperial police.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.374
You're a lap dog for eastern depot!

22:41.375 --> 22:42.490
No, I just picked it up.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.582
They seem like formidable foes.

22:47.042 --> 22:48.922
I don't stand a chance
against them in a fight.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.331
She's so gorgeous.

22:51.917 --> 22:53.532
She must be the leader.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.370
These two are about the same age
and move together.

22:59.958 --> 23:01.619
They must be from the same clan.

23:03.875 --> 23:06.412
With an abacus in his
hand, he must be greedy.

23:07.292 --> 23:09.658
I can get rid of him if
I offer him some perks.

23:11.583 --> 23:14.120
Worn out clothes and sinister faces.

23:15.167 --> 23:17.328
These hoodlums aren't worth my time.

23:19.875 --> 23:21.991
No one's touching
that piece of meat.

23:23.167 --> 23:24.202
It must be spiked.

23:24.708 --> 23:27.290
This ragtag gang must
be up to something.

23:28.667 --> 23:30.532
What is it?

23:31.042 --> 23:33.283
What are they up to?

23:33.708 --> 23:35.994
If I'm not mistaken,
you guys are planning to pull off...

23:36.792 --> 23:38.828
That heist from water margins?

23:39.250 --> 23:39.957
How did you know that?

23:39.958 --> 23:40.749
Just a guess.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.590
Looks like you're too
smart for your own good.

23:45.167 --> 23:47.082
Look, I'll tell you the truth.

23:47.083 --> 23:50.041
I'm in charge of hygiene
at an official's residence nearby.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.748
Simply put, I'm a janitor.

23:51.875 --> 23:54.457
Three months ago, I picked
up that plaque on the street.

23:54.708 --> 23:56.582
How do you pick up an
imperial police plaque?!

23:56.583 --> 23:58.183
You'll just have to
take my word for it.

23:58.417 --> 23:59.374
Besides,

23:59.375 --> 24:01.366
I fell from the sky.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.616
Maybe the gods sent
me here to help you.

24:03.750 --> 24:04.791
How can you help us?

24:04.792 --> 24:06.532
I know this area better than anyone.

24:08.792 --> 24:09.792
Tell us what you got.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Here we go.

24:11.500 --> 24:15.243
Huatian was a rest stop
between Hanzhong and Jianzhou.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.163
There's no one within 15 kilometers
in any direction.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.749
Soldiers get exhausted
transporting goods on this road,

24:20.750 --> 24:22.541
so they always stop
here for a break.

24:22.542 --> 24:25.416
That's why this is the perfect spot
for an ambush.

24:25.417 --> 24:27.874
However, the station's been
out of commission for a while.

24:27.875 --> 24:31.572
6 people with weapons hanging out
at an abandoned shack,

24:32.458 --> 24:34.540
even a blind man can tell
you're up to no good.

24:35.083 --> 24:38.280
So your plan isn't going to work.

24:38.958 --> 24:41.124
How do we put them at ease then?

24:41.125 --> 24:44.868
It's easy. Clean the place up
and turn it into an inn.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.706
Hold a grand re-opening.

24:47.833 --> 24:48.832
Do we have enough time?

24:48.833 --> 24:50.448
That's what we need
to make good use of.

24:51.292 --> 24:53.374
Time!

24:53.375 --> 24:55.366
Ready... action!

24:56.500 --> 25:00.368
The soldiers must be
rushing to move their cargo.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.080
I'll place a Boulder
on a narrow part of the path.

25:05.292 --> 25:09.331
When the soldiers see
it blocking their way,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.615
they'll have no choice but to stop.

25:15.042 --> 25:16.248
I couldn't find a horse.

25:17.292 --> 25:20.910
The soldiers will do everything
they can to clear the path.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.832
You need a diet, boss.

25:26.833 --> 25:27.833
Shut up!

25:30.583 --> 25:31.416
Meanwhile,

25:31.417 --> 25:33.624
we'll work together to spruce up
the inn. Don't look, it's filthy!

25:33.625 --> 25:37.038
Make it pretty and inviting
to our esteemed guests.

25:37.208 --> 25:38.493
There's no hair there.

25:38.833 --> 25:42.405
Meanwhile, once the soldiers
get the Boulder out of the way.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.124
Go away, Boulder. Hurry.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.458
That's right.

25:47.875 --> 25:51.666
The imperial soldiers
will kick the doors down

25:51.667 --> 25:54.283
and see our polished,
flawless establishment.

25:54.458 --> 25:56.999
At their hungriest,

25:57.000 --> 25:58.661
thirstiest hour,

25:58.833 --> 26:00.124
we'll serve them the meat.

26:00.125 --> 26:01.125
Come here, fatty.

26:01.292 --> 26:02.332
I thought I'm the Boulder.

26:03.167 --> 26:04.282
Now you're the leader.

26:04.417 --> 26:06.157
This is the meat.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.403
Hold your breath and take a bite.

26:10.542 --> 26:14.457
Bro, how can you just leave
me like this? Cover yourself.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.949
The drug kicks in,
the soldiers faint,

26:17.333 --> 26:18.743
mission accomplished.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.615
You're quite clever.

26:22.042 --> 26:23.916
What's your name?

26:23.917 --> 26:26.875
Are you interested in me, miss?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.456
He's out of line!

26:28.833 --> 26:29.541
What do you care?

26:29.542 --> 26:31.783
My name is cypress.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.125
I need some sleep.

26:38.042 --> 26:40.033
I don't trust people
who are too clever.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.749
Especially those of dubious origins.

26:41.750 --> 26:45.663
He's already told us his plan.
No need to keep him around.

26:45.833 --> 26:48.575
Hide him somewhere
so he doesn't create trouble for us.

26:49.667 --> 26:50.541
We need a rope for that first.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.416
Let me use that cloth

26:52.417 --> 26:53.416
around your waist.
Don't touch me!

26:53.417 --> 26:54.499
Stop moving.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.874
I just need to loosen it.
Don't touch me!

26:55.875 --> 26:56.749
Let him borrow it, man.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.791
Lift the legs.
Bella,

26:57.792 --> 26:58.792
get the clean-up started.

27:02.750 --> 27:03.785
Stop!

27:08.708 --> 27:09.708
Here they come!

27:14.083 --> 27:15.083
Let me do it!

27:20.458 --> 27:22.995
Dumping a Boulder in the
middle of the road.

27:23.333 --> 27:24.573
That's just plain rude.

27:32.042 --> 27:33.042
Good work!

27:46.083 --> 27:47.083
My goodness...

27:49.708 --> 27:51.619
How powerful!

27:51.958 --> 27:53.289
We're up, saucy. Go!

27:58.917 --> 27:59.917
Who are you?

28:05.333 --> 28:08.700
Bro, our family
heirloom's been smashed!

28:09.083 --> 28:09.832
That's right.

28:09.833 --> 28:11.166
It's totally smashed!
My illness will never be cured!

28:11.167 --> 28:13.954
You're dying at such a
young age, little bro!

28:16.000 --> 28:17.285
You can have it back.

28:17.958 --> 28:20.040
Now get out of the way!

28:21.417 --> 28:23.954
Father! Mother!

28:24.500 --> 28:26.082
You've been blown away by the wind!
These idiots

28:26.083 --> 28:27.698
are clearly swindlers.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.407
Mother! Father!

28:30.625 --> 28:31.874
Help!

28:31.875 --> 28:33.581
There's another one of them?!

28:33.833 --> 28:35.698
It was a tiger!

28:35.958 --> 28:38.244
Who are you, ma'am? Please leave.

28:38.375 --> 28:41.037
Your father's been eaten by a tiger!

28:43.958 --> 28:45.207
Papa!

28:45.208 --> 28:46.208
Pipe down!

28:46.583 --> 28:49.249
Didn't you say these were
your parents' ashes?

28:49.250 --> 28:52.447
Now your father's
been eaten by a tiger?

28:54.250 --> 28:56.081
I'm their stepmother!

28:56.875 --> 28:57.990
Mother!

28:58.458 --> 29:00.995
I already got a new man, you fools.

29:02.083 --> 29:05.249
You've been wronged, father!

29:05.250 --> 29:08.742
The minute you're gone,
she's already replacing you!

29:12.292 --> 29:17.241
Don't take this road!
There really is a tiger up ahead!

29:17.833 --> 29:18.541
I think we failed.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.783
I like fighting tigers!

29:23.333 --> 29:26.075
Wash, wash, wash.
Brush, brush, brush.

29:26.208 --> 29:27.994
Stupid, dumb blade.

29:28.125 --> 29:30.207
Running off instead of helping me...

29:30.208 --> 29:31.374
I'm confused.

29:31.375 --> 29:36.082
Why would the army be
out here cleaning an old shack?

29:36.083 --> 29:37.619
That stupid frigid
must be a swindler.

29:37.792 --> 29:40.033
Some Vixen pretending to be pure.

29:40.167 --> 29:41.623
That damn fox!

29:42.000 --> 29:43.615
I'm right here, Missy.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.741
I'm not afraid of you, ugly Vixen.

29:48.125 --> 29:49.490
So noisy...

29:57.042 --> 30:00.041
Welcome!

30:00.042 --> 30:02.541
After 9 months of
extensive renovation,

30:02.542 --> 30:04.407
we're finally re-opening
our doors today.

30:04.625 --> 30:08.243
And you're our very first
customer, sir.

30:09.125 --> 30:11.207
Tea cultivated at
the top of Mengshan.

30:11.417 --> 30:14.909
Don't worry, we use 100%
genuine ingredients.

30:18.625 --> 30:20.707
To ensure a good time
for all our guests,

30:20.708 --> 30:23.575
all our staff have gone
through vigorous training.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.157
This way, sir.

30:28.542 --> 30:30.703
This is the renowned
chef mount from capital.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.119
He looks familiar...

30:34.875 --> 30:37.332
Impossible! This way, please.

30:43.625 --> 30:44.625
Good evening sir!

30:44.833 --> 30:46.082
Is the water of
suitable temperature?

30:46.083 --> 30:48.041
What the hell is this?

30:48.042 --> 30:49.582
Japanese-style milk foot bath.

30:49.583 --> 30:51.619
A spot of health care, sir.

30:53.750 --> 30:55.082
A spot of health care?

30:55.083 --> 30:56.289
That's right, a teeny spot.

31:00.958 --> 31:04.666
We're here to please
all your senses.

31:04.667 --> 31:07.534
You don't want to miss this!

31:23.250 --> 31:27.949
You know exactly what I like, kid.

31:28.125 --> 31:32.073
I like my women feral
with a bit of meat.

31:34.917 --> 31:36.828
You're looking slutty there, boss.

31:37.083 --> 31:39.369
What do you know
about belly dancing?!

31:47.167 --> 31:49.579
Sir, please try our
signature braised meat.

31:50.042 --> 31:50.916
Wait.

31:50.917 --> 31:53.582
Ask them to come down. I can pay.

31:53.583 --> 31:55.244
Sure. You beasts...

31:56.458 --> 31:59.416
Girls, come down for
a drink with our guest.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.749
Go on, saucy. Get down here
and drink with our guest!

32:01.750 --> 32:03.490
Come on down, babies.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.728
It stinks in here!
Is that underwear?!

32:07.167 --> 32:09.829
Holy crap, look at those pigs.

32:14.458 --> 32:15.707
Come on, baby.

32:15.708 --> 32:17.118
Take it easy.
Come here.

32:25.833 --> 32:27.243
Have some meat, sir.

32:29.417 --> 32:30.497
Wait.

32:31.792 --> 32:37.537
I want you girls to feed
me with your mouths.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.660
Eat up!

32:40.333 --> 32:41.333
Eat it.

32:45.208 --> 32:46.539
Idiots.

32:53.208 --> 32:55.790
Fine. You want mouth-to-mouth?

32:56.708 --> 32:57.708
Here we go.

32:58.708 --> 33:00.323
Saucy, your facial hair is showing.

33:00.875 --> 33:01.875
Wait.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.448
You're a special one.
You even have facial hair.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.157
Where the hell's my weapon?!

33:19.042 --> 33:20.998
They screwed up.
And it ain't my fault.

33:23.458 --> 33:24.458
Whoops.

33:24.958 --> 33:27.574
You clowns think you can swindle me?

33:28.250 --> 33:30.582
We were just hoping
to borrow something of yours.

33:32.750 --> 33:35.207
Sure, but you have
to get permission...

33:36.167 --> 33:37.167
From him!

33:40.750 --> 33:41.750
You're talking to...

33:45.583 --> 33:48.120
You're talking to
the white-browed...

33:49.208 --> 33:50.288
White-browed...

33:53.125 --> 33:53.957
Look, lady...

33:53.958 --> 33:56.620
I know you want to fight,
but let me finish my name...

33:58.375 --> 33:59.785
Stop being rude!

34:09.458 --> 34:10.458
Catch!

34:13.083 --> 34:14.493
It's on fire!

34:15.917 --> 34:16.917
Bella.

34:18.875 --> 34:19.915
Who turned the lights out?

34:22.792 --> 34:24.157
They're so damn rude!

34:24.708 --> 34:25.708
Get them!

34:26.958 --> 34:28.158
He's so obsessed with manners.

34:28.958 --> 34:30.118
Here comes my abacus!

34:35.250 --> 34:36.614
You've stomped my foot, saucy!

34:37.500 --> 34:38.500
Take this!

34:39.958 --> 34:40.623
Gotcha!

34:40.625 --> 34:42.581
Please spare me!

34:42.875 --> 34:43.875
Go to hell!

34:46.833 --> 34:49.916
Take this.

34:49.917 --> 34:51.123
I'll nail you bastards!

34:51.417 --> 34:52.417
See ya!

34:54.167 --> 34:55.828
I can't stay here.

34:58.708 --> 34:59.708
See my blade!

35:04.875 --> 35:05.875
Don't move!

35:07.833 --> 35:08.833
Run away!

35:10.500 --> 35:11.580
Time to go!

35:23.917 --> 35:25.032
No sense in chasing him.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.033
The silver's right here, saucy!

35:28.417 --> 35:29.497
I'm not chasing him.

35:31.542 --> 35:33.703
It's so heavy. We're rich!

35:35.667 --> 35:36.907
Open the chest.

35:37.167 --> 35:38.532
The silver's definitely in here.

35:47.458 --> 35:51.030
It's coming!

35:52.583 --> 35:53.666
The fight's already over, man.

35:53.667 --> 35:54.907
When did he get out?

35:55.417 --> 35:56.417
It's coming!

35:56.708 --> 35:58.699
Who's coming?
Get down and play dead!

36:01.500 --> 36:02.332
What the hell?

36:02.333 --> 36:03.333
Hide!

36:03.458 --> 36:05.374
I'm talking to you!

36:05.375 --> 36:07.036
Hide!
What is this idiot doing?

36:20.667 --> 36:21.667
What's going on here?

36:23.417 --> 36:24.623
That sounds familiar.

36:30.958 --> 36:32.078
What the hell is this thing?

36:36.333 --> 36:37.197
What in the world is this?

36:37.333 --> 36:38.853
It can't possibly
be that thing again.

36:45.250 --> 36:46.250
What the hell is that?!

36:48.583 --> 36:51.074
The clouds are coming in!

36:52.833 --> 36:53.833
Holy smokes!

37:20.417 --> 37:21.417
Stop it. That hurts.

37:25.958 --> 37:27.038
It's so cute.

37:29.333 --> 37:30.333
Wait! Come back!

37:30.542 --> 37:31.332
Careful, Bella.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.869
Look at this thing, blade.

37:35.708 --> 37:36.948
Such a cute puppy.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.500
I think it's a monkey.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.081
It's obviously a dog.

37:41.667 --> 37:42.667
Where did it come from?

37:43.542 --> 37:44.702
Are you a boy or a girl?

37:50.833 --> 37:51.913
You like this?

38:02.542 --> 38:03.873
Is this what you like?

38:22.542 --> 38:24.498
Save me, blade!
Bella, are you okay?

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Asshole!

38:37.250 --> 38:38.250
Don't scream.

38:57.875 --> 38:59.615
What did you do to it?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.706
It's hotter than me when it's big.

39:28.833 --> 39:29.833
Back off!

39:39.667 --> 39:40.957
Stay away from me!

39:40.958 --> 39:43.449
Stop, or I'll fight back!

39:43.792 --> 39:45.953
Why are you searching me?!
You're too rough!

39:49.917 --> 39:51.416
What the hell are you doing?

39:51.417 --> 39:53.207
I don't know you.

39:53.208 --> 39:55.249
Look, you damn furry thing,

39:55.250 --> 39:57.166
my allergies are going crazy,
I'm itchy all over

39:57.167 --> 39:58.832
and you won't even answer me!

39:58.833 --> 40:00.414
Step back, or I'll jump!

40:18.833 --> 40:19.833
Hold that breath...

40:21.500 --> 40:22.500
Hold that breath...

40:23.792 --> 40:24.957
Don't be afraid, frigid.

40:24.958 --> 40:25.958
I'll protect you!

40:35.333 --> 40:36.082
Blade!

40:36.083 --> 40:37.707
Put away your sword!

40:37.708 --> 40:40.166
It gets agitated when it
sees a weapon. Put it away!

40:40.167 --> 40:41.498
Hurry! Put it away!

40:41.667 --> 40:43.373
Put it away!

40:47.375 --> 40:49.666
Don't eat me. I'm so bony and thin.

40:49.667 --> 40:52.500
My meat looks smooth,
but it tastes terrible.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.490
Same with Bella.
Neither of us is tasty.

40:55.250 --> 40:56.541
Neither of us is tasty.

40:56.542 --> 41:00.160
There's a fat one over there.
Eat him.

41:00.792 --> 41:01.952
You little weasel!

41:05.542 --> 41:07.783
Good thing I'm trained
in circus tricks.

41:11.625 --> 41:12.740
He's gonna do what?!

41:16.292 --> 41:17.702
That's a huge mouth.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.374
You can do it, boss!
Just a little harder.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.740
Put your back into it!

41:22.792 --> 41:23.792
Put your back into it!

41:38.917 --> 41:40.282
Wait...

41:46.375 --> 41:47.990
I can't believe that
fits in his mouth.

41:50.792 --> 41:52.657
I'm not hungry!

41:53.292 --> 41:55.829
Wait, don't move. Stay there.

41:59.667 --> 42:00.667
Crap!

42:01.792 --> 42:02.792
What's going on?

42:03.542 --> 42:04.542
Stay back,

42:04.833 --> 42:06.494
or you're gonna get it.

42:12.292 --> 42:13.292
This isn't mine!

42:22.792 --> 42:23.872
Go!

42:30.208 --> 42:31.208
Go over there!

42:31.833 --> 42:33.073
I'm sorry!

43:23.542 --> 43:24.542
Lucky!

43:33.458 --> 43:35.119
Ocean hit me...

44:09.125 --> 44:10.125
Go.

44:14.083 --> 44:15.083
Go on!

44:27.083 --> 44:28.083
Get out!

44:34.917 --> 44:36.908
Ocean...

44:51.292 --> 44:52.292
Who burnt you?

44:56.583 --> 44:57.583
Lucky!

45:00.583 --> 45:01.993
Lucky.

45:09.833 --> 45:10.833
Ocean...

45:15.625 --> 45:16.625
Frigid.

45:16.958 --> 45:18.949
I've finally found you, ocean.

45:24.667 --> 45:26.783
The fish and the
goose are long gone.

45:28.042 --> 45:30.203
I've always known that
separation is painful.

45:31.792 --> 45:33.748
Even a short reunion
with my beloved...

45:34.708 --> 45:37.575
Is worth giving up
my time in the world.

45:38.125 --> 45:43.449
"People fight for
the vanity of glory."

45:43.583 --> 45:48.031
"Like water,
life moves in uncertain ways."

45:49.167 --> 45:54.036
"To find the love of a lifetime,."

45:55.250 --> 45:59.118
"I'm not afraid of
treacherous paths."

45:59.958 --> 46:05.157
"Knowing that the
blade is heartless"

46:05.458 --> 46:08.999
"makes this heart feel uneasy."

46:09.000 --> 46:11.041
"We leave our grudges aside."

46:11.042 --> 46:15.411
"Our reunions may be short-lived,"

46:15.542 --> 46:16.957
"but this love in our hearts"

46:16.958 --> 46:20.701
"will live on forever."

46:21.875 --> 46:25.207
"The road ahead of
us may stretch on."

46:25.208 --> 46:26.948
"It may stretch on..."

46:27.292 --> 46:31.535
"I'm not afraid of
the blizzards ahead."

46:33.083 --> 46:34.457
"There's always tenderness..."

46:34.458 --> 46:35.698
"All that's left in life..."

46:36.208 --> 46:38.574
Frigid, I'm using my power
to get you out of here.

46:38.708 --> 46:41.124
"I think back on our
joys and sorrows."

46:41.125 --> 46:43.707
"This love we share."

46:43.708 --> 46:48.782
"I move forward with a
proud smile at the sky,"

46:49.125 --> 46:53.164
"despite all the
vicissitudes of the past."

46:54.542 --> 46:59.416
"I will no longer talk
about the fleeting past.”

46:59.417 --> 47:00.666
"The love in our hearts"

47:00.667 --> 47:04.785
"can still live forever."

47:05.542 --> 47:11.333
"I will no longer talk
about the fleeting past.”

47:12.000 --> 47:16.289
"This love can still
live on forever."

47:31.083 --> 47:32.082
Am I dreaming?

47:32.083 --> 47:34.699
We'll never part again, ocean.

47:35.167 --> 47:36.247
Blade.
Frigid.

47:41.083 --> 47:43.244
You're not fully recovered yet.

47:43.417 --> 47:45.166
Who's this handicapped man?

47:45.167 --> 47:48.832
I knew this woman was up to no good.

47:48.833 --> 47:52.332
They're rekindled old flames.

47:52.333 --> 47:54.124
This makes me sick.

47:54.125 --> 47:54.957
Sick!

47:54.958 --> 47:57.745
I'm sorry.
There was no silver all along.

47:59.750 --> 48:00.750
No silver?

48:01.583 --> 48:04.624
I can stand losing a girl,
but not losing money!

48:04.625 --> 48:05.416
No way!

48:05.417 --> 48:07.374
We've put our necks
on the line by killing soldiers

48:07.375 --> 48:09.206
so you can reunite
with your boyfriend?!

48:10.042 --> 48:11.657
You still have me, blade.

48:12.125 --> 48:15.242
12 acupuncture points
sealed by silver needles.

48:15.542 --> 48:18.124
If you push them all out at once,

48:18.667 --> 48:20.749
your body's inner balance
will fall into chaos.

48:20.958 --> 48:23.870
Must be a real master.

48:25.667 --> 48:28.707
Look, the rogue imperial policeman!

48:28.708 --> 48:29.708
Ocean!

48:30.750 --> 48:32.365
Reward is 30,000 taels of silver!

48:32.542 --> 48:33.957
You've got the wrong man.

48:33.958 --> 48:35.957
They look equally ugly!

48:35.958 --> 48:37.619
This is definitely him.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.957
His clothes are a bit...

48:38.958 --> 48:39.957
A bit dirty.

48:39.958 --> 48:41.249
The hairstyle's wrong, too.

48:41.250 --> 48:42.911
That's right.
It's the hair.

48:43.042 --> 48:44.332
Sir, if you don't mind...

48:44.333 --> 48:45.832
If you're not him...
Miss frigid, come here.

48:45.833 --> 48:48.870
Then sit down and
let us examine you.

48:51.875 --> 48:53.081
Is it like this?

48:53.208 --> 48:54.323
Well?

48:55.208 --> 48:56.291
He looks nothing like that.
Really?

48:56.292 --> 48:57.657
What are you doing?

48:58.042 --> 49:00.082
No way. Let me do it.
Is it wrong?

49:00.083 --> 49:01.874
I think it's right.
That's more like it.

49:01.875 --> 49:03.160
Let me do it.

49:03.417 --> 49:05.157
That's your spit, man.
Check this out.

49:05.667 --> 49:07.658
Here we go.

49:07.792 --> 49:09.166
See?
Not really.

49:09.167 --> 49:10.541
Why don't we just do
it at the same time?

49:10.542 --> 49:11.577
It looks about the same.

49:12.875 --> 49:13.707
Finally!

49:13.708 --> 49:16.207
A humdrum hairstyle.
Just like that on the poster.

49:16.208 --> 49:17.948
He's really worth
30,000 taels of silver.

49:18.458 --> 49:21.040
I pegged you wrong.
You're on our side after all.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.331
What's happening?
That hurt!

49:25.708 --> 49:26.749
That almost blew me away!

49:26.750 --> 49:27.956
Are you all right, frigid?

49:29.833 --> 49:30.833
Get up.

49:31.458 --> 49:32.624
Hey, old man, - go away.

49:32.625 --> 49:34.124
I thought you said he's hurt.
Why did you help her up

49:34.125 --> 49:35.416
instead of me?!
I meant that

49:35.417 --> 49:36.782
his powers were erratic.

49:39.750 --> 49:41.035
Who's on your side?!

49:42.292 --> 49:43.582
I didn't say a thing.
Mercy, sir!

49:43.583 --> 49:45.249
If you touch him, you damn bum,

49:45.250 --> 49:46.615
I'll kill you!

49:52.333 --> 49:54.449
I saved you because I love you.

49:54.833 --> 49:57.040
Did you save me
because you love me...

49:57.417 --> 49:58.998
Or because of the price on my head?

50:08.958 --> 50:10.164
Again?

50:10.833 --> 50:12.457
Stop it.

50:12.458 --> 50:14.082
We get it already.

50:14.083 --> 50:15.666
I can't stand this. Just stop.

50:15.667 --> 50:17.407
Let her dance. It's nice.

50:19.750 --> 50:21.490
You're an official's daughter.

50:21.625 --> 50:22.865
But since you met me,

50:24.333 --> 50:25.333
you've suffered too much.

50:26.958 --> 50:29.449
If turning me in will get you
30,000 taels of silver...

50:31.250 --> 50:33.332
Then do it. I won't resent you.

50:34.292 --> 50:35.292
Ocean.

50:37.083 --> 50:38.323
You're all I care about.

50:43.042 --> 50:47.624
Do you think ocean's injuries
will affect his fertility?

50:47.625 --> 50:48.625
Possibly.

50:50.292 --> 50:51.498
I'm just kidding.

50:51.667 --> 50:53.749
Lucky was chasing you.
Did you burn it?

50:53.875 --> 50:55.595
It's all a misunderstanding, man.
Listen...

50:56.750 --> 50:57.416
Ocean.

50:57.417 --> 50:58.457
You...

50:58.458 --> 51:00.124
He's down again.
Just chill for a bit.

51:00.125 --> 51:02.374
What does lucky have to do with you?

51:02.375 --> 51:03.956
Who the hell are you? Speak!

51:04.125 --> 51:06.041
You don't need to
point a sword at me.

51:06.042 --> 51:07.722
Wait, I have to figure
out where to start.

51:15.083 --> 51:17.165
"I'm cypress and I'm the man"

51:17.292 --> 51:19.328
"who's well known across the land."

51:24.000 --> 51:26.124
"One fine day,
I got the inspiration"

51:26.125 --> 51:28.286
"to serve the public
and help the nation."

51:28.458 --> 51:32.781
"I aced it at the examination,"

51:32.917 --> 51:37.240
"with no problem
winning altercations."

51:37.375 --> 51:41.618
"I topped my class,
becoming an elite."

51:41.833 --> 51:46.076
"And I was soon given
the prison beat."

51:46.250 --> 51:50.448
"One stormy night, someone
stormed the prison."

51:50.667 --> 51:52.874
"They killed my friends and
left my heart broken."

51:52.875 --> 51:55.041
"Disillusioned,
I left my dreams behind."

51:55.042 --> 51:59.331
"I reached Zhu village
which settled my mind."

51:59.542 --> 52:01.707
"The village was
haunted by a monster,"

52:01.708 --> 52:04.041
"and the villagers'
prayers went unanswered."

52:04.042 --> 52:08.240
"I'm too kind not to
save them from trouble,"

52:08.458 --> 52:10.749
"cypress will ne'er, ne'er, ne'er"

52:10.750 --> 52:12.581
"burst their bubble."

52:12.917 --> 52:15.041
"I thought things through
and had a master plan."

52:15.042 --> 52:17.249
"A fire would make the
monster leave its den."

52:17.375 --> 52:19.499
"Badly injured,
the monster ran and ran."

52:19.500 --> 52:21.749
"I saved the day and
saved their clan!"

52:21.750 --> 52:22.785
We defeated the monster!

52:36.292 --> 52:40.749
"The villagers then
called me a hero."

52:40.750 --> 52:45.207
"I would strive to
reduce crime to zero."

52:45.208 --> 52:46.948
"All the way to zero."

52:47.375 --> 52:50.412
That was a pretty great
story, right?

52:51.000 --> 52:54.242
Did the story make you guys
fall in love with me?

52:56.625 --> 52:58.624
You know the rest of the story.

52:58.625 --> 52:59.910
Any questions?

53:00.500 --> 53:03.742
The monster... is it the one
on the wanted posters?

53:04.417 --> 53:05.417
Let me see it.

53:06.958 --> 53:09.540
Another 30,000 taels of
silver for the monster.

53:10.583 --> 53:11.583
I have an idea.

53:12.583 --> 53:16.121
Why don't we team up to catch it?
Make this worth our time.

53:16.417 --> 53:19.955
We can make a total of 60,000 taels!

53:20.542 --> 53:21.542
That's right.

53:25.750 --> 53:27.706
But I can't beat him. Can you?

53:29.375 --> 53:31.582
If we aren't powerful
enough to capture this bounty,

53:31.583 --> 53:34.495
what makes you think
we can get the one out there?

53:34.708 --> 53:39.998
Listen, we've been chasing
this monster for weeks...

53:40.208 --> 53:42.048
I thought we had just
started yesterday, boss.

53:43.500 --> 53:46.041
But because of a
small momentary error,

53:46.042 --> 53:48.954
the monster managed
to escape our grip.

53:49.083 --> 53:51.119
We weren't even close to it, boss.

53:53.292 --> 53:56.659
Anyway,
since we're such selfless folks,

53:56.917 --> 53:58.877
we've decided to
share the reward with all of you.

53:59.417 --> 54:01.207
But, boss, we couldn't catch it
in the first place.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.124
Can you shut up?

54:03.125 --> 54:06.957
If I help you catch the monster,
can I get a cut?

54:06.958 --> 54:07.958
You wish.

54:08.333 --> 54:11.780
Well said! Welcome to the team.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.749
Boss, if they join
us, then we'll have...

54:14.750 --> 54:18.197
One... two... three...

54:19.667 --> 54:20.624
A lot of people!

54:20.625 --> 54:22.957
Besides, with the south
Sichuan bandits around,

54:22.958 --> 54:25.449
there's no way the monster
can hurt any of you.

54:26.833 --> 54:29.996
Do you think we'll be
able to catch it, blade?

54:30.375 --> 54:32.661
It's pretty scary
when it transforms.

54:37.542 --> 54:40.791
I wasn't confident, but...

54:40.792 --> 54:42.832
We've got a bait right here.

54:42.833 --> 54:45.449
Feed the spiked meat to the bait,

54:45.708 --> 54:49.249
then have the monster eat the bait.

54:49.250 --> 54:50.706
It'll hurt, right, bait?

54:51.375 --> 54:52.832
Then the monster

54:52.833 --> 54:54.744
will be in our hands.
Good idea.

54:56.375 --> 54:57.615
You bastards.

54:58.083 --> 54:59.499
You people still
call yourself human?

54:59.500 --> 55:01.791
I don't think I can do it, either.

55:01.792 --> 55:03.082
It's just too cruel.

55:03.083 --> 55:06.916
Great men make sacrifices.
He's a slapdog.

55:06.917 --> 55:08.082
I left a long time ago!

55:08.083 --> 55:10.707
If we treat him with such cruelty,

55:10.708 --> 55:12.499
how does that make
us better than him?

55:12.500 --> 55:13.999
She's right, you'll be no different!

55:14.000 --> 55:17.166
If his death keeps our army going,

55:17.167 --> 55:18.748
I won't hesitate a bit.

55:21.583 --> 55:23.995
You people... you...

55:26.167 --> 55:27.167
The monster!

55:27.542 --> 55:29.407
Where?

55:29.625 --> 55:30.666
Hey, stop right there!

55:30.667 --> 55:32.123
Blade, get back here!

55:33.167 --> 55:36.409
Now I see that a human life
is worth nothing to you.

55:36.875 --> 55:38.082
And that the end will
justify any means.

55:38.083 --> 55:39.416
I'm worth nothing to you, either.

55:39.417 --> 55:41.817
That's right. The silver is
all you care about, isn't it?

55:43.375 --> 55:44.457
Bella!

55:44.458 --> 55:45.458
What's she mad about?

55:45.750 --> 55:46.750
Bella!

55:48.083 --> 55:49.198
Lucky!

55:50.958 --> 55:52.073
Lucky!

55:52.583 --> 55:55.450
You need to hide. People
are coming for you.

56:14.292 --> 56:15.873
Jeez, this is scary.

56:23.208 --> 56:25.415
Ahh, I ain't afraid of you!

56:42.208 --> 56:43.208
Lucky.

56:43.667 --> 56:44.667
Lucky.

56:45.375 --> 56:47.457
Who gave you such a
tacky name anyway?

56:48.833 --> 56:51.449
Lucky, are you crying?

56:53.125 --> 56:54.410
Who's there?

56:56.167 --> 56:57.167
Lucky...

56:57.917 --> 56:58.917
What's wrong?

56:59.583 --> 57:00.583
What's wrong?

57:01.792 --> 57:02.656
You're hurt.

57:02.792 --> 57:03.792
Are you hurt?

57:04.750 --> 57:05.865
You're hurt, right?

57:07.917 --> 57:08.997
Are you in pain?

57:10.500 --> 57:11.706
How about some medicine?

57:14.708 --> 57:15.708
Bells.

57:21.083 --> 57:22.083
Here's some medicine.

57:31.333 --> 57:32.333
Sit down right now!

57:33.250 --> 57:34.291
Sit!

57:34.292 --> 57:35.577
Down, right now!

57:36.375 --> 57:37.410
Be good.

57:37.833 --> 57:39.915
You know,
if I don't put medicine on that,

57:40.042 --> 57:42.749
it'll never heal.
And it'll get worse.

57:43.542 --> 57:45.658
Then you'll die. Is that clear?

57:45.875 --> 57:48.116
I'll be sad if you die, okay?

57:48.458 --> 57:49.538
Do you want me to be sad?

57:49.833 --> 57:52.540
Things will get really
bad if I'm sad. Sit!

57:53.792 --> 57:55.077
Get over here!

57:55.417 --> 57:57.749
Be good. Don't get big and scare me.

58:00.125 --> 58:02.286
If you scare me, I'll die.

58:05.833 --> 58:07.994
This is all I have
left, so don't waste it.

58:09.542 --> 58:11.707
Stop moving!

58:11.708 --> 58:13.073
Or the medicine will come off.

58:15.208 --> 58:16.744
Feeling better, lucky?

58:20.500 --> 58:21.990
You're so cute when you laugh.

58:27.833 --> 58:29.289
Such an adorable little thing.

58:31.250 --> 58:33.707
Slow down,
or the medicine will come off.

58:47.917 --> 58:48.576
Lucky,

58:48.833 --> 58:50.915
is this where you live?

58:51.500 --> 58:52.865
It's roomy.

59:02.583 --> 59:05.700
Practitioners can stretch
their tendons and exercise.

59:07.833 --> 59:09.118
Have the freedom...

59:09.625 --> 59:11.145
To contract and
release your meridians

59:11.958 --> 59:13.448
and change your shape as you wish.

59:15.792 --> 59:18.204
Is this how you learned
to change in size?

59:24.292 --> 59:25.782
Is this your father?

59:29.667 --> 59:30.667
He only has one arm...

59:31.542 --> 59:32.657
It's Yang!

59:33.250 --> 59:34.332
Yang the one-armed warrior!

59:34.333 --> 59:35.573
I love him!

59:35.958 --> 59:38.040
It would be great if I
can get an autograph!

59:38.792 --> 59:40.077
I'm drooling already...

59:40.708 --> 59:42.039
But I don't really mean that.

59:42.375 --> 59:43.410
Don't come for me.

59:43.750 --> 59:45.240
I'm a coward, really.

59:48.625 --> 59:49.740
Let's never meet again.

01:00:34.042 --> 01:00:37.207
Can't believe those idiots
want to use me as bait.

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:40.530
Ocean, you're almost fully
recovered. Don't get worked up.

01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:46.492
Do you still remember me, sir?

01:00:47.042 --> 01:00:49.909
I was a Minion back
at eastern depot.

01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:05.958
What are you two doing?

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.909
Oh, I get it.

01:01:08.208 --> 01:01:10.791
You want to touch her,
but she won't let you.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:11.624
You won't take no for an answer,

01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:13.581
and that's why you're
pushing back and forth.

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:18.787
So you can't move.
Let's see what's in your pack.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:20.750
Do it if you want to die.

01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:24.833
Don't get mad.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:28.245
You'll regret it if
you destroy your body.

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:31.125
Look at this meat.

01:01:35.833 --> 01:01:37.448
I should feed a
slice to each of you.

01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:41.114
Once you pass out,
I'll take you back to eastern depot

01:01:41.333 --> 01:01:42.374
and all will be forgiven.

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:45.993
And you can die
as star-crossed lovers. How's that?

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:48.708
Open your mouth, girl.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.289
Why is it so hard to feed you?

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.543
See what you can do
when I feed you both together.

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:17.243
It's kind of salty.

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:23.993
What is this place?

01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:26.789
These are all graves!

01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:28.158
There's a slice of bread here.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.039
Boss, do you think cypress
will get eaten by the monster?

01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:43.291
He will.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.692
Then let's get outta here.
Sure.

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:46.125
Cowards.

01:02:47.167 --> 01:02:48.407
Have you seen Bella?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.207
You scared me!
Bella's been eaten by the monster.

01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:53.536
Did you see it with your own eyes?
I didn't.

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:56.665
Did you?
Nope.

01:02:57.708 --> 01:03:00.541
It's just a cemetery.
Why are they so freaked out?

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:11.208
Bella, where are you? Bella...

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:18.582
My lord!

01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:20.995
Constable Wang?
Where are your manners?

01:03:21.375 --> 01:03:23.536
Aren't you supposed to be
guarding the fugitive?

01:03:23.792 --> 01:03:24.792
My lord...

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:28.166
We were ambushed by
rebels at Huatian courier station.

01:03:28.167 --> 01:03:32.456
The leader was far too powerful.

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:36.492
I was prepared to die,
but I managed to escape.

01:03:36.625 --> 01:03:38.991
I didn't think I would be
so lucky to run into you, my lord.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.374
I subdued ocean with silver needles.
He's paralyzed.

01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:44.208
Let's go to Huatian
and destroy them!

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:49.542
Wang...

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:54.447
You've been my spy and
vessel for some time, right?

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:02.578
Spy for five years,
and vessel for another five.

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:05.615
Fifteen years altogether, my lord.

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:10.785
How dirty...

01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:16.280
Any family members at home?

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:18.490
Quite a few, my lord.

01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:22.032
Good...

01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:26.957
They'll be busy during
the grave sweeping festival.

01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:27.958
That's right.

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:39.291
Get us to Huatian station now!

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.327
We're off!

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:01.744
Oh, no, frigid and the
others are in danger.

01:05:02.958 --> 01:05:04.243
Find a place to hide, lucky.

01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:20.124
Oh, crap!

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:21.582
We have to run!

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:22.582
What's going on?

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:23.791
The eastern depot is here.
I wanted to

01:05:23.792 --> 01:05:25.791
use this idiot to bait the monster
and then this happens.

01:05:25.792 --> 01:05:27.082
Should we fight them head on?

01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:28.323
With what?

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.749
They're killers from eastern depot!

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.081
I have an idea.

01:05:32.792 --> 01:05:33.499
Run.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.457
Saucy!

01:05:34.458 --> 01:05:36.832
If you don't run now,
it'll be too late.

01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:37.618
I admire your chivalry!

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:38.750
Respect!

01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:40.407
What's wrong with you people?

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:42.743
You got to wait for us. Let's go!

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:44.490
What's frigid going to do?

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.166
When we master our martial arts,

01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:47.707
we'll avenge her. Come on.

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:48.708
No!

01:05:50.958 --> 01:05:53.874
I'm sorry I offended you, frigid,

01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:55.582
and I'm sorry that
blade harassed you.

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:58.120
Please don't hold a grudge.
We're sorry.

01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:00.790
Our kung fu skills are limited,
so we can't be of help.

01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:06.666
Don't worry. You're a good girl.

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:08.783
I won't resent you.
Take blade and go.

01:06:09.667 --> 01:06:10.667
Let's go!

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:16.160
Frigid.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:19.117
I'm the one eastern depot wants.
Get to safety with them.

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:21.790
You still don't get it, ocean.

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:22.989
What is it?

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:27.118
I've been following you,
with plenty of chances to save you.

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:29.957
But why do you think
I chose to rescue you here?

01:06:30.542 --> 01:06:33.454
Because there's no one within
15 kilometers in any direction.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:36.992
When you're backed into a corner,
you might as well be dead.

01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:41.322
My whole family died
at the hands of eastern depot.

01:06:41.833 --> 01:06:44.245
I survived because
you saved me in time.

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:45.708
Kill him!

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:51.072
I've been feeling uneasy
because I haven't gotten revenge.

01:06:53.917 --> 01:06:56.533
I was planning to fight eastern
depot to the death anyway.

01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:01.208
Come here and sit.

01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:03.125
Sit down.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.035
I'll face death with you.

01:07:12.542 --> 01:07:14.832
I was touched by your love,

01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:17.416
so I decided to die with you here.

01:07:17.417 --> 01:07:20.250
Right. A true hero doesn't run
at the first sign of trouble.

01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:24.280
The south Sichaun bandits are
all about loyalty!

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:27.040
No way we can abandon
the old and weak here.

01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:29.082
Just stop lying!

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:31.620
Spare the flowery excuses already.

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:32.792
The truth is...

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:35.873
We're stuck here!
We're screwed.

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:38.707
We've been surrounded!

01:07:59.792 --> 01:08:01.392
That's the commander
of eastern depot...

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.500
Crane.

01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:13.916
My god, I'm hungry.

01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:16.533
We're so dead.

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:41.957
Crane,

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.490
how dare you?

01:09:43.667 --> 01:09:46.041
How dare you raise
your voice in here?

01:09:46.042 --> 01:09:48.124
Don't you know that
our lord likes silence?

01:09:48.332 --> 01:09:49.332
Kneel...

01:09:51.707 --> 01:09:53.618
since you know who I am...

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:55.032
For whom do you work for?

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:56.748
Ci-qing palace.

01:09:59.875 --> 01:10:01.206
Ci qing palace?

01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:04.875
Why would the crown
prince send you here?

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:08.749
Since when does his highness

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:10.536
report to eastern depot?

01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:12.292
Of course not.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.490
I've simply come

01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:16.407
to retrieve an escaped beast

01:10:16.958 --> 01:10:18.619
and a fugitive named ocean.

01:10:20.625 --> 01:10:24.288
You used the imperial police's tamer
to tame those beasts

01:10:24.542 --> 01:10:25.957
with the intention of
assassinating his highness.

01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:29.030
To cover your tracks,
you slaughtered countless others.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:31.662
That's punishable by death
to you and your family.

01:10:32.625 --> 01:10:34.490
How can you pin false
accusations on me?

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:35.990
You need proof.

01:10:36.125 --> 01:10:37.490
The proof is inside this building.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.160
Hand me the evidence!

01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:40.458
Yes, ma'am!

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:54.917
Ocean.

01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:57.244
You think you can get away,

01:10:57.667 --> 01:11:00.500
but his highness has been
watching you for a long time.

01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.283
Now I have both the animal and
the fugitive in my hands.

01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:12.245
What do you think of my evidence?

01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:17.824
I swear it was a mistake.

01:11:18.292 --> 01:11:22.457
Please think of the decades
I've served the court

01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:23.823
and spare my life.

01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:30.953
Get me the execution cloth!

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.706
His highness is in a merciful mood.

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:50.411
Considering that you served
his majesty for so many years,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.207
I'll make sure you have
a fully intact corpse.

01:12:20.292 --> 01:12:22.248
Oh no! Can't see me!

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:24.375
Lucky...

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.286
Since his majesty's beast is here,

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.241
that means the content of this bag

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:43.866
is definitely fake.

01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:50.994
Who hit me?

01:12:51.542 --> 01:12:52.542
He did.

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:57.333
Good job!

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.541
The little show you just did

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.328
was quite a performance.

01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:04.539
If I'm not mistaken,

01:13:05.042 --> 01:13:08.614
you're frigid,
daughter of a traitor.

01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:12.790
The loving glance that
ocean just gave you

01:13:14.042 --> 01:13:15.248
sold you out, I'm afraid.

01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:46.743
I've had enough!

01:13:46.917 --> 01:13:48.791
I told you this plan
isn't going to work.

01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:49.792
Shut your mouth!

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:50.784
Idiots!

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
All of you are idiots!

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:53.416
I told you already!

01:13:53.417 --> 01:13:55.541
Stop playing tricks
or going against the emperor.

01:13:55.542 --> 01:13:56.666
But you guys didn't listen.

01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:57.791
Now you all look like fools.

01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:58.874
What are you so afraid of, blade?

01:13:58.875 --> 01:14:00.374
We can die and take
that dog with us.

01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:01.455
You can die all you want,

01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:02.874
but did you think about what I want?

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:04.866
Being stuck here with
you is already torture.

01:14:05.125 --> 01:14:06.707
You! To save that lump of coal,

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:10.280
you duped Bella and I
to this godforsaken place.

01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:13.625
Then that old man popped up,
then came these two bandits.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.457
Then this imbecile
fell out of the sky.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.865
Fine, I kept playing along.

01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:20.923
Then you tell me that the
money never existed?

01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:22.499
You put us through all this

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.786
just to save your boyfriend!

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:28.199
You coward.
You're saving your own ass

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:29.957
by pinning everything on her.

01:14:29.958 --> 01:14:31.198
Who are you to lecture me?

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:34.124
An imperial police turned fugitive.

01:14:34.125 --> 01:14:35.831
Was it for national security?

01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:37.789
No, it was for this woman!

01:14:38.667 --> 01:14:41.332
Ocean the great warrior...
Do you deserve to be called one?

01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:42.573
Sorry about this.

01:14:42.917 --> 01:14:43.874
Calm down, blade.

01:14:43.875 --> 01:14:44.955
Stay away from me!

01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:46.410
I'm not your buddy!

01:14:46.542 --> 01:14:49.291
I'm risking my life,
and you're playing with a monster.

01:14:49.292 --> 01:14:50.791
Then you call me ruthless?!

01:14:50.792 --> 01:14:52.157
You're going too far.

01:14:53.042 --> 01:14:54.042
I'm going too far?

01:14:55.167 --> 01:14:56.847
Who here isn't doing
worse things than me?

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.999
You!

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.041
You risked our lives for
your stupid revenge.

01:15:01.042 --> 01:15:02.157
That's downright evil.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:05.749
You!

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:08.916
Greedy old man with
the guts to demand 30% of the cut.

01:15:08.917 --> 01:15:11.954
After we're killed, they should
slice you three more times.

01:15:13.333 --> 01:15:14.823
And you two bums...

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.124
Trying to kill us for a piece
of meat, like some wild dog.

01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:18.124
Who are you calling a wild dog?

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.661
I'll give you a bite right now!

01:15:20.125 --> 01:15:21.125
What are you looking at?

01:15:21.542 --> 01:15:23.078
You're the cruelest of them all.

01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:25.416
Burning up a mountain
and sacrificing lives

01:15:25.417 --> 01:15:27.207
just to draw a monster to you?

01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:28.928
You're a curse to anyone
who runs into you!

01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:30.911
La la la, blah blah blah.

01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:34.083
Good job.

01:15:34.958 --> 01:15:35.958
Good job.

01:15:36.458 --> 01:15:37.743
That must feel good.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.788
Honest, righteous young men like you

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.240
are in short supply these days.

01:15:44.083 --> 01:15:46.324
What's your name, boy?

01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:52.660
My surname is Zhen, named blade.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.833
Formerly the Sichuan-Shaanxi
rebel forces,

01:15:55.958 --> 01:15:57.414
but now your humble servant.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.456
If you don't mind...

01:16:13.583 --> 01:16:15.164
I'd like to call you...

01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:17.583
My godfather.

01:16:19.458 --> 01:16:20.948
Come here.
Godfather.

01:16:26.417 --> 01:16:28.829
Good boy. I'll give you a hug later.

01:16:34.583 --> 01:16:36.791
I've never seen anyone
more shameless than me.

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:38.041
You're a despicable man!

01:16:38.042 --> 01:16:39.498
What a coward!

01:16:40.292 --> 01:16:41.953
I pegged you wrong, blade.

01:16:42.417 --> 01:16:43.999
I should be saying that!

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Blade.

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.456
That man is ruthless.

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:48.661
It won't do you any
good to work for him.

01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:52.416
Won't do me any good to
stick with you, either.

01:16:52.417 --> 01:16:53.782
Look at everything you've done.

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:56.290
You're all just looking
out for yourselves.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.490
I just want to live.

01:16:59.125 --> 01:17:00.410
Is that so wrong?

01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:06.457
Blade.

01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:07.573
You loathsome scoundrel.

01:17:08.083 --> 01:17:09.163
You deserve to die.

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:12.750
Crane,

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.823
we'll settle our score later.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.206
Save me, godfather!

01:17:20.667 --> 01:17:21.782
I'll help you, ocean.

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:23.413
So will well.

01:17:24.083 --> 01:17:26.166
I'm going to kill you
in the name of the Guiyi army!

01:17:26.167 --> 01:17:27.623
This jerk has to die today!

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.956
Don't worry, my child.

01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:35.166
How can I let any harm come to you?

01:17:36.167 --> 01:17:39.534
I still need someone
to speak the truth to my face.

01:17:44.917 --> 01:17:45.917
My lord.

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.533
That stings.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.623
I got you.

01:17:53.792 --> 01:17:54.582
Great warrior ocean...

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:56.164
That was a bull's eye, right?

01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:58.790
Damn it, it hurts like hell.

01:17:58.917 --> 01:18:00.077
Right in his Achilles' heel.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.500
Serves you right!

01:18:04.042 --> 01:18:05.374
Crane's weak spot

01:18:05.375 --> 01:18:06.624
is the central meridian on his back.

01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:08.041
So our plan B

01:18:08.042 --> 01:18:09.249
is to force him to use his power

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.124
while one of us stabs him
in his Achilles' heel.

01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:12.911
That's our only chance of survival.

01:18:13.958 --> 01:18:14.958
Sounds good.

01:18:24.417 --> 01:18:26.078
What are you trying to say?

01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:28.164
Pretend to betray us

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:30.073
and get his trust.

01:18:30.292 --> 01:18:32.658
Go around his back and
stab his Achilles' heel.

01:18:35.333 --> 01:18:36.582
You must be kidding.

01:18:36.583 --> 01:18:38.166
How do I go around to his back

01:18:38.167 --> 01:18:39.624
then stab him with a dagger?

01:18:39.625 --> 01:18:42.367
You're unleashing some
serious traitor vibes.

01:18:42.625 --> 01:18:44.457
You're the best man for the job.

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:45.416
Do I look like a traitor?

01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:46.417
You do.

01:18:47.458 --> 01:18:48.249
You really do.

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.161
Stay out of this, you brat!

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.331
Sounds right. You can do it, kid.

01:18:52.542 --> 01:18:55.332
My lord.
Kill them all, right now!

01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:56.333
Yes, my lord!

01:18:57.458 --> 01:18:58.458
My fellow heroes,

01:18:58.708 --> 01:19:01.370
leave this to the
south Sichuan bandits.

01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:04.579
That's right. You're
about to see our moves.

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:05.580
Saucy!

01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:07.494
The bandits combination fists!

01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:12.707
Combination fists?

01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:14.164
I'll make your eyelids close first!

01:19:18.625 --> 01:19:20.786
Come on, we haven't merged yet.

01:19:26.583 --> 01:19:27.624
Ocean,

01:19:27.625 --> 01:19:30.367
I'll take care of this one.

01:19:30.542 --> 01:19:31.657
Careful, sir.

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:55.829
How can you use a gun?
That's cheating!

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.991
You want to take me on?
You shameless thug!

01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:00.869
I want that gun, blade!

01:20:01.375 --> 01:20:02.457
It's so awesome!

01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:04.039
It's right there. Go get it.

01:20:08.583 --> 01:20:11.165
Who else wants to get shot?

01:20:34.292 --> 01:20:37.284
This is great! Ocean's powers
are back to normal.

01:20:39.917 --> 01:20:41.291
Spare me, ocean!

01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:42.332
We were just following orders.

01:20:42.333 --> 01:20:43.874
Our consciences are killing us.
We can't sleep.

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:45.124
We can't even eat.
That old fart,

01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:46.749
forced us to do bad
things every day.

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:48.957
He's the killer.
We are innocent. Spare us!

01:20:48.958 --> 01:20:50.457
Long live the Guiyi army!

01:20:50.458 --> 01:20:51.874
I'm with you guys now!
I'm in, too!

01:20:51.875 --> 01:20:53.041
I'm with you guys now!

01:20:53.042 --> 01:20:54.402
You like hearing the truth, right?

01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:55.875
Did you hear that?

01:21:04.958 --> 01:21:07.040
This is eye-opening.

01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:10.666
I've never heard so
many truths in my life.

01:21:10.667 --> 01:21:11.747
My lord!

01:21:22.292 --> 01:21:23.874
I have a truth to reveal, too.

01:21:23.875 --> 01:21:25.291
I actually serve the eastern depot.

01:21:25.292 --> 01:21:26.953
I'm secretly serving you now.

01:21:27.125 --> 01:21:28.125
Go away!

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:30.073
Did I not speak clearly enough?

01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:31.782
You were loud and clear.

01:21:32.292 --> 01:21:33.292
The problem is...

01:21:33.708 --> 01:21:35.369
I don't trust anyone now.

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:36.625
Crane.

01:21:36.833 --> 01:21:38.869
Didn't I get you in
your Achilles' heel?

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.833
I've been practicing
the Jiuyang virgin fist for years.

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:44.161
I don't have any Achilles' heel.

01:21:45.125 --> 01:21:46.740
I'm invincible.

01:21:49.917 --> 01:21:51.999
I told you this
wasn't going to work!

01:21:58.833 --> 01:22:01.495
So you're the slut that
stole ocean from me.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.041
How dare you?

01:22:03.042 --> 01:22:04.782
What you have is nothing

01:22:05.417 --> 01:22:07.749
compared to the 20 years
I've had with ocean.

01:22:08.292 --> 01:22:09.332
Let her go!

01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:10.333
Ocean.

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.500
Is she prettier...

01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:13.208
Or am I prettier?

01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:15.949
Please don't look at me
with those queer eyes.

01:22:16.792 --> 01:22:19.283
Such an emotional man.

01:22:19.708 --> 01:22:21.118
Fight me instead.

01:22:21.417 --> 01:22:24.375
You really want to fight me? Fine.

01:22:24.917 --> 01:22:28.865
I want her to watch you
slowly die by my hand.

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:08.458
Ocean...

01:23:28.167 --> 01:23:29.457
Ocean!
Ocean! Are you alright?

01:23:29.458 --> 01:23:30.374
Ocean!
Frigid.

01:23:30.375 --> 01:23:31.541
Don't die, ocean.
Frigid.

01:23:31.542 --> 01:23:33.157
If you die, then it's all over.

01:23:33.333 --> 01:23:34.416
Are you all right?

01:23:34.417 --> 01:23:36.123
You're the only real
fighter we have.

01:23:36.292 --> 01:23:37.892
I can't believe he
perfected his powers.

01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:39.573
Now he is invincible.

01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:40.697
The only thing in this world

01:23:40.875 --> 01:23:41.875
that can defeat him

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:45.075
is the extinct one-armed palm.

01:23:47.417 --> 01:23:48.657
The one-armed palm?

01:23:49.542 --> 01:23:50.542
I know it.

01:23:51.042 --> 01:23:51.707
I know it!

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:53.582
How? I taught you
everything you know.

01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:54.583
I really do know it!

01:23:54.833 --> 01:23:55.666
Seriously?

01:23:55.667 --> 01:23:56.499
Positive!

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.380
Then give it a try.
Does she really know it?

01:24:26.042 --> 01:24:27.042
We're screwed.

01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:39.999
Hang in there!
Will this really work?

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.536
We've got a fighting chance.
Help her!

01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:44.369
Concentrate! Don't lose focus!

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:51.909
Should I run or should I help them?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.116
Of course I should help
them, you idiot!

01:25:42.417 --> 01:25:43.832
Lucky! No!

01:25:43.833 --> 01:25:46.950
A little thing like you
is going to defeat me?

01:25:51.042 --> 01:25:52.623
Stay away, lucky!

01:25:52.833 --> 01:25:54.039
Run, lucky!

01:25:54.792 --> 01:25:55.907
You'll die.

01:25:57.167 --> 01:25:58.953
Run away!

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:19.042
Amazing!

01:26:19.958 --> 01:26:22.415
You think I'll be intimidated
because you turned big?

01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:30.708
That looks painful.

01:26:30.875 --> 01:26:32.081
Good thing that's not me.

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:34.250
Do it!

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.457
I'm not afraid of your crappy power.

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:37.493
Get his face again!

01:26:51.375 --> 01:26:52.375
That's awesome.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.658
He must at least be
paralyzed by now.

01:26:58.625 --> 01:27:00.411
You think this is victory for you?

01:27:00.792 --> 01:27:02.032
You troublemakers.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.865
All of you are going to die

01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:06.411
right here with me.

01:27:08.792 --> 01:27:09.541
What's this?

01:27:09.542 --> 01:27:10.702
Scratching stick?

01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:14.742
Is this one of those
signal cannons from Persia?

01:27:15.042 --> 01:27:17.442
Fire it into the air, and the
brigade will fire at us, right?

01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:19.240
Why do you have it?!

01:27:19.375 --> 01:27:20.660
Let me refresh your memory.

01:27:20.875 --> 01:27:22.624
When I told you just now that
I work for eastern depot,

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:24.581
that's when I stole it from you.

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:35.623
So what if you have it?

01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:38.160
Do you even know how to use it?

01:27:38.292 --> 01:27:41.364
You must think I'm an idiot.
It's easy. Just press like this...

01:27:57.042 --> 01:27:58.124
You can have this.
Idiot.

01:27:58.125 --> 01:28:00.325
Don't give it to me!
I don't know how to use it, either!

01:28:09.167 --> 01:28:10.498
Hide!
Oh my god!

01:28:11.917 --> 01:28:13.373
Bella.
Where do we hide, boss?!

01:28:26.333 --> 01:28:27.333
Hide!

01:28:29.625 --> 01:28:30.625
Lucky!

01:28:31.833 --> 01:28:33.118
Ocean...

01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:41.787
Don't go out there! You'll die!

01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:45.458
Lucky!

01:28:57.375 --> 01:28:58.581
Run!

01:29:38.875 --> 01:29:39.582
You first, kid.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:42.957
You first, sir.
You first, kid.

01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:45.199
You can have the last bun, boss.

01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:48.838
You get hungry easily, saucy.
You should eat it.

01:29:49.167 --> 01:29:50.249
I don't need it.

01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:51.080
I've got another bun here.

01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:52.770
Didn't you say this
was the last one?!

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.206
Don't worry, Bella,
I'll protect you.

01:29:56.333 --> 01:29:57.957
In all the years I've known you,

01:29:57.958 --> 01:29:59.539
growing up together...

01:29:59.667 --> 01:30:02.454
This is the first time
you've acted like a man.

01:30:08.208 --> 01:30:10.199
You first, sir.
You first, kid.

01:30:10.375 --> 01:30:12.124
You first, sir.
Fine, then you can die first.

01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:13.990
Get in here or you'll die!

01:30:25.125 --> 01:30:26.240
Assholes!

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.241
Buddha palm!

01:31:49.833 --> 01:31:50.833
Lucky!

01:31:51.667 --> 01:31:52.247
Lucky!

01:31:52.625 --> 01:31:53.785
You can't possibly be dead.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Lucky!

01:31:55.458 --> 01:31:56.458
Lucky!

01:31:57.083 --> 01:31:58.083
Lucky!

01:31:58.958 --> 01:31:59.958
Lucky!

01:32:00.417 --> 01:32:01.417
Lucky!

01:32:01.958 --> 01:32:02.958
Lucky!

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:04.750
Luck...

01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:06.250
Lucky!

01:32:07.375 --> 01:32:08.916
Get up!

01:32:08.917 --> 01:32:11.158
I still have to
complete my training.

01:32:12.542 --> 01:32:13.542
Lucky!

01:32:28.708 --> 01:32:31.207
Damn it, you made me cry.

01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:34.405
Can't believe it's laughing.

01:32:47.917 --> 01:32:49.999
This is unbelievable.

01:32:54.083 --> 01:32:56.950
That's harsh.
Save me, ocean!

01:32:57.458 --> 01:32:58.698
Get him!

01:32:59.542 --> 01:33:00.542
I'm sorry!
Good job!

01:33:00.667 --> 01:33:02.249
You reap what you sow!

01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:03.285
Thank you, frigid.

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.332
Stop following me! Why
are you still on my ass?

01:33:11.333 --> 01:33:12.707
What did I do to you, man?

01:33:12.708 --> 01:33:14.124
We're not the same kind.

01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:15.541
I've got no love for you.

01:33:15.542 --> 01:33:17.203
Just get away from me.

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:18.625
Save me, ocean!

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:20.125
Master ocean!

01:33:20.667 --> 01:33:22.248
Why won't he leave me alone?!

01:33:24.542 --> 01:33:25.622
It's because of this.

01:33:27.375 --> 01:33:29.036
I just picked this up in the woods.

01:33:46.167 --> 01:33:47.487
It's a dangerous world out there.

01:33:47.708 --> 01:33:49.073
If it's treacherous even for us,

01:33:50.167 --> 01:33:51.327
imagine how it'll be for you.

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.500
Am I right?

01:33:55.708 --> 01:33:56.788
Go back to the woods.

01:33:58.042 --> 01:34:00.533
I hope this bracelet
will bring you luck.

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:08.618
Ocean...

01:34:18.875 --> 01:34:19.875
Don't cry.

01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:21.708
Go on.

01:35:00.542 --> 01:35:01.542
Don't be sad.

01:35:04.667 --> 01:35:07.409
Will we ever see it again, blade?

01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:10.245
Of course we will,
the clever thing will find us.

01:35:34.875 --> 01:35:36.240
Thank you, all of you.

01:35:36.708 --> 01:35:37.791
I know we've been a burden

01:35:37.792 --> 01:35:39.416
and dragged you all into trouble.

01:35:39.417 --> 01:35:40.417
We're really sorry.

01:35:43.292 --> 01:35:44.782
Actually, I should thank all of you.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.865
I didn't even believe in myself,

01:35:47.083 --> 01:35:48.374
but all of you believed in me

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:50.124
and gave me the important job
of playing traitor.

01:35:50.125 --> 01:35:53.947
Blade, I feel like my love
for you just went up a notch.

01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:58.330
After this ordeal,

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.331
I feel like we've
come closer together.

01:36:00.833 --> 01:36:02.323
I hope we can all be friends.

01:36:05.083 --> 01:36:07.950
Look, everyone,
I'm usually a lone wolf.

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:10.081
And it gets pretty lonely.

01:36:11.625 --> 01:36:13.291
Where are you guys off to?

01:36:13.292 --> 01:36:15.624
Would you all mind
if I tagged along?

01:36:15.875 --> 01:36:16.916
Join us.

01:36:16.917 --> 01:36:17.916
Boss,

01:36:17.917 --> 01:36:20.541
I feel like we've finally
done something meaningful.

01:36:20.542 --> 01:36:21.577
I'm overflowing with joy.

01:36:21.875 --> 01:36:23.374
Ocean, I'm sticking
with you from now on.

01:36:23.375 --> 01:36:24.375
Sounds good!

01:36:24.625 --> 01:36:25.832
You two are still young.

01:36:25.833 --> 01:36:29.621
I've haven't done a decent
thing in my old age.

01:36:30.042 --> 01:36:31.042
I feel like...

01:36:33.458 --> 01:36:34.948
I've matured.

01:36:35.167 --> 01:36:36.577
But I think you've gotten younger.

01:36:37.167 --> 01:36:38.532
I have a confession to make.

01:36:38.667 --> 01:36:40.623
There's an eastern
depot vault nearby.

01:36:40.875 --> 01:36:42.207
It's completely unguarded,

01:36:42.208 --> 01:36:43.249
and there are a lot of gold inside.

01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:44.250
I'm not joking.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.582
You can all grab as
much as you like.

01:36:46.583 --> 01:36:47.791
Call it a token of appreciation
from the two of us.

01:36:47.792 --> 01:36:48.792
In that case...

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.956
Bella and I have a
small errand to run.

01:36:51.708 --> 01:36:52.914
We'll take our leave.

01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:54.541
We'll be right back.

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:55.624
We're not coming right back.

01:36:55.625 --> 01:36:57.957
Maybe I'm better
off alone after all.

01:36:58.292 --> 01:37:01.082
I'm starving, saucy.
Let's get something to eat.

01:37:01.083 --> 01:37:03.124
Don't be a glutton.
Then again, everyone's got to eat.

01:37:03.125 --> 01:37:04.831
I'm starving, too.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.367
How did you find time
to put on so much make-up?

01:37:12.833 --> 01:37:14.915
It's so nice that you
should keep it on.

01:37:17.625 --> 01:37:18.705
Let's go!

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:20.238
Let's go!
What are you doing?

01:37:21.417 --> 01:37:23.032
You want a bun? I've got some.

01:37:23.417 --> 01:37:24.666
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.
Buns?

01:37:24.667 --> 01:37:26.203
I was just kidding.
Where is it?

01:37:26.333 --> 01:37:27.493
Where did you get the bun?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.786
I'm getting angry now.

01:38:02.167 --> 01:38:03.623
I don't want to do this anymore.

01:38:08.958 --> 01:38:11.244
Fine, I'll fetch! I wanna go home...

01:38:29.083 --> 01:38:31.745
Fetching is so much hard work...

01:38:32.305 --> 01:38:38.636
