01:14.281 --> 01:15.483
<i>Intruders detected.</i>

01:21.222 --> 01:23.960
[Laura's voice echoes]

01:23.960 --> 01:29.697
Okay, you need to help me
pick up this twat's scribblings
so that we can skedaddle.

01:29.697 --> 01:31.935
Rita, I realize
that you're having

01:31.935 --> 01:34.569
some kind of a dis-associative
episode right now,

01:34.569 --> 01:39.208
but would you please
re-associate and...
and fucking help me?

01:39.941 --> 01:41.911
Bendy, please!

01:41.911 --> 01:43.546
[woman over PA system]
<i>Would the death squad
report to cell block D?</i>

01:43.546 --> 01:45.448
<i>Death squad to cell block D.</i>

01:45.448 --> 01:46.916
[whispers]
Death squad.

01:46.916 --> 01:48.217
- [PA system] <i>Thank you.</i>
- [Rita] Maybe we should.

01:48.217 --> 01:49.685
Yeah, maybe.

01:49.685 --> 01:50.786
But, how do we...

01:52.153 --> 01:55.524
Oh, I've got it. I've got it.

01:55.524 --> 01:57.493
[electronic voice]
<i>Intruders detected.</i>

01:57.493 --> 02:00.096

<i>- Intruders detected.</i>

02:00.096 --> 02:04.500
<i>Intruders detected.</i>

02:04.500 --> 02:08.004
[Rita] Can't you
move any faster?
We're completely exposed here.

02:08.004 --> 02:11.240
[Laura] I'm a suitcase!

02:11.240 --> 02:14.577
- [Laura] Bloody ball sacks!
We've got company.
- [Rita] Is it the death squad?

02:14.577 --> 02:17.413
- [Laura shushes]
- [Rita] Shit! Shit! Shit!

02:18.612 --> 02:20.349
[squad member]
Colonel Samsonite.

02:20.349 --> 02:24.253
[electronic voice]
Intruders detected.
Intruders detected.

[Laura laughing]

02:28.956 --> 02:30.759
[electronic voice]
<i>Intruders detected.</i>

02:39.300 --> 02:42.838
So, how's that plan
coming along, Clifford?

02:42.838 --> 02:44.540
[Cliff] Got 'em right
where I want 'em.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.342
[Vic] What are you guys
even doing here?

02:46.342 --> 02:48.411
How about a thanks
for coming to help your
captured asses?

02:48.411 --> 02:51.014
[Cliff] Technically,
we only came to get
Jane's longevity back.

02:51.014 --> 02:53.416
But we probably would've tried
to help you. If there was time.

02:53.416 --> 02:55.218
[Vic] Right, sorry.
Thanks for the help.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.819
When did you plan
on starting, by the way?

02:56.819 --> 02:59.388
With the helping. Just wanna
make sure I don't miss it.

03:03.891 --> 03:05.661
[Derick] Look,
we're all stuck in here now.

03:05.661 --> 03:07.296
Maybe instead
of picking at each other,

03:07.296 --> 03:09.632
we can try to be
more solution oriented.

03:09.632 --> 03:11.634
Find a way
how to get outta here.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.904
Who's got ideas?

03:14.904 --> 03:18.307
You telling us how to do
superhero shit?

03:18.307 --> 03:20.376
You fucking Boy Scout.
[chuckles]

03:20.376 --> 03:24.380
- Don't fuck with our process.
- Yeah. [laughs]

03:26.882 --> 03:28.251
Welcome to my world.

03:35.622 --> 03:40.663
Ay, but let me know when you
guys want a problem solved.
'Cause I have an idea.

03:43.231 --> 03:45.668
[scoffing] What the fuck
is that?

03:45.668 --> 03:46.602
A rock.

03:49.237 --> 03:50.706
[rumbling]

03:54.141 --> 03:58.781
- Oh yeah! Rock beats scissors,
motherfuckers! [laughs]
- Nice!

03:59.647 --> 04:01.884
Not bad, for a normie.

04:01.884 --> 04:04.620
Told ya I had 'em
right where i wanted 'em.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.621
[grunts]

04:08.456 --> 04:10.293
Let's go get my
stolen longevity.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.427
What about Larry?

04:11.927 --> 04:13.162
Oh, right.

04:13.162 --> 04:14.363
Ay, we got him.

04:15.096 --> 04:16.232
[Cliff] Sweet.

04:16.232 --> 04:17.633
Smell you fools later.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.608
[Laura] Oh, my God.
My insides feel so weird.

04:25.608 --> 04:28.877
Like my liver's where
my lungs should be.

04:28.877 --> 04:33.616
Did you move anything around
when you were inside me?

04:38.719 --> 04:40.423
We said we don't know
that he's dead.

04:42.290 --> 04:43.692
We don't know that he's not.

04:45.492 --> 04:46.930
You know, when you kill a fly,

04:46.930 --> 04:48.464
what do you see?

04:48.464 --> 04:51.634
Bit of blood, some white goo.

04:51.634 --> 04:57.806
Maybe a broken leg or two
mixed in with some crumpled
wings that may never fly again.

05:01.141 --> 05:04.447
Point is, is that if he, you
know, he really had killed him,

05:04.447 --> 05:07.583
then there'd be, you know,
he'd have left something
disgusting behind.

05:08.315 --> 05:09.618
Like blood.

05:09.618 --> 05:12.488
Feces, droplets of urine
sort of thing.

05:13.621 --> 05:15.491
You mean, like this?

05:17.124 --> 05:18.094
[mouthing] Fuck.

05:18.860 --> 05:19.795
Um...

05:21.328 --> 05:24.400
You know what?
We should just focus
on something else.

05:24.400 --> 05:29.705
Like this mountain of papers
we brought back.

05:29.705 --> 05:35.945
Maybe there's something in here
that will tell us about this,
you know, Immortus fellow.

05:35.945 --> 05:39.015
Um, we may have more immediate
fish to fillet.

05:42.015 --> 05:46.289
[Reads note] Gone to Orqwith
for J's longevity.

05:46.289 --> 05:50.526
And rescue Larry
if there's time.

05:50.526 --> 05:52.929
That's it.
Larry's longevity, gone.

05:52.929 --> 05:54.397
Well, we don't know
that for sure.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.565
It's Larry.
Trust me, it's gone.

05:57.031 --> 05:58.267
[sighs]

05:58.267 --> 06:00.569
Cliff's officially the last
longevital man standing.

06:00.569 --> 06:05.241
Uh-uh. And he's just marched
his metal tuchus into
the lion's den.

06:05.241 --> 06:07.710
We have to go after them.

06:07.710 --> 06:09.946
- Does this note tell us how
they got there?
- No.

06:09.946 --> 06:13.116
It's a stupid note.
This is a stupid note.

06:14.782 --> 06:16.986
Okay. Well, fine.
Back to plan A.

06:16.986 --> 06:22.291
We'll go through Wally's papers
and, uh, see if there's...
there's a map or something.

06:22.291 --> 06:26.529
Some kind of map that would
give us, um, you know...

06:26.529 --> 06:27.863
Best of luck to you.

06:27.863 --> 06:30.266
Um, okay, where...
where are you going?

06:30.266 --> 06:33.736
Upstairs. To quietly expire.

06:33.736 --> 06:36.072
Right. Well, you go
enjoy your nap.

06:36.072 --> 06:39.842
Whilst I look
at this shite art.
I mean, what the fuck?

06:41.975 --> 06:44.613
[Cliff] Okay, I get we're
looking for your longevity.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.516
But what the fuck does your
longevity even look like?

06:47.516 --> 06:48.817
[Jane] Fuck if I know.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.454
[Cliff] What
do you remember?

06:54.890 --> 06:56.025
Purple.

06:56.025 --> 06:58.527
Purple, wha... That's it?
That's all you remember?

06:58.527 --> 07:01.197
I was a fucking baby!

07:07.068 --> 07:10.173
- [Cliff] Oh, shit.
- [Jane] And there it is.

07:11.972 --> 07:14.143
How the fuck are we
gonna get past these

07:14.143 --> 07:16.079
beauty school dropouts?

07:16.079 --> 07:20.749
Also, how do they dress
themselves. Or pee?

07:26.988 --> 07:27.856
What?

07:34.162 --> 07:37.133
Hey! Edward Scissorfucks!

07:37.133 --> 07:39.168
Listen up, fuckos!

07:39.168 --> 07:41.104
Back away from the lava lamp.

07:41.104 --> 07:44.873
Or I'll fuck the tinman's
longevity into kingdom come.

07:44.873 --> 07:47.610
- Tinman, really?
- Shut up, R2-dipshit.

07:47.610 --> 07:49.878
That's my girl.

07:49.878 --> 07:51.475
[Wally]
No need for that, friend.

07:52.313 --> 07:53.516
[Cliff] What the fuck?

07:53.516 --> 07:54.918
You again?

07:54.918 --> 07:57.153
I have something to offer you,
Mr. Steele.

07:58.619 --> 08:00.823
A world of possibilities.

08:00.823 --> 08:02.591
[Cliff] Fuck's that supposed
to mean?

08:02.591 --> 08:05.828
It doesn't fucking matter
because we're not
fucking interested.

08:05.828 --> 08:08.331
- Yeah.
- So you can go fuck yourself
into oblivion.

08:08.331 --> 08:09.732
Fuck yeah!

08:09.732 --> 08:12.201
Is that true, Cliff?

08:12.201 --> 08:16.405
Are you not interested
in seeing the limitless potentialities

08:16.405 --> 08:18.307
that Immortus has to offer you?

08:18.307 --> 08:21.144
- Mm.
- A future, Cliff.

08:21.144 --> 08:26.282
Which, from what I understand,
you don't have much of
at the moment.

08:26.282 --> 08:28.851
[Cliff] Um...

08:28.851 --> 08:32.655
Fucking A right, he's not
interested. Tell 'em, Cliff.

08:32.655 --> 08:36.492
- Err...
- Cliff!

08:36.492 --> 08:41.864
I mean, we could, just,
you know, just listen
to the guy, right?

08:41.864 --> 08:45.334
[Jane] What? What the fuck
are you talking about?

08:45.334 --> 08:48.737
[Cliff sighs] Go on.

09:06.721 --> 09:08.157
Hey, is that something?

09:10.524 --> 09:13.762
[Vic] I know that blue glow.
That's Larry and Keeg.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.232
[Deric] So how do we
get around those guys?

09:17.764 --> 09:20.403
[Vic] Man, I fucking hate
those guys.

09:20.403 --> 09:21.770
Can you drop some
more boulders?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.539
[Derick] Nah, there's
too many of 'em.

09:23.539 --> 09:24.873
You wanna get to your boys,

09:25.941 --> 09:27.243
we're gonna have to fight.

09:37.784 --> 09:39.888
My arm cannon?
Why'd you draw that?

09:39.888 --> 09:42.825
Are you kidding me?
'Cause it's fucking dope.

09:54.035 --> 09:55.271
Damn...

09:58.472 --> 10:01.677
Here, you take it.

10:01.677 --> 10:06.882
Thanks, but... I was
thinking it might look
pretty badass on you.

10:08.216 --> 10:09.085
Really?

10:10.051 --> 10:10.920
Yeah.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.230
- [cannon whooshes]
- Oh my... [laughs]

10:22.831 --> 10:24.300
Yo, this does feel nice.

10:26.334 --> 10:30.173
So what about you?
What's your weapon of choice?

10:35.376 --> 10:38.814
- [knock at door]
- Go away!

10:46.053 --> 10:49.358
Does go away mean something
different in Scotland?

10:49.358 --> 10:51.760
Yes, it means stop being
a silly old sausage

10:51.760 --> 10:55.798
and help me build
an interdimensional portal
to Orqwith.

10:56.798 --> 10:58.601
I beg your pardon?

10:58.601 --> 11:01.604
I found the schematics

11:01.604 --> 11:03.973
in creepy Walt Disney's
doodlings.

11:03.973 --> 11:08.311
I also found the parts we need,
and a few we don't,
if you know what I mean.

11:08.311 --> 11:10.513
Now all I need is Y-O-U.

11:10.513 --> 11:12.081
Which spells you.

11:12.081 --> 11:14.517
It's always best to have
a second set of eyes

11:14.517 --> 11:18.521
when you're attempting
to rip a hole into space time,

11:18.521 --> 11:20.889
that's what I always say.

11:20.889 --> 11:26.762
The thing is,
as it turns out, I'm lousy
at this superhero business.

11:26.762 --> 11:33.469
And I'm far too busy feeling
unmoored and useless
to build a portal today.

11:33.469 --> 11:36.906
Oh, now, come on, Bendy.
That's not how I see it.

11:36.906 --> 11:40.543
You know, we would've never
gotten into the Ant Farm
if it wasn't for you.

11:40.543 --> 11:46.082
Where I proceeded to erase
out of existence our best bet
at finding information

11:46.082 --> 11:50.286
on Immortus and recapturing
our longevity.

11:50.286 --> 11:56.192
True. And we found
a schematic, which will
get us to the place

11:56.192 --> 12:01.097
where Immortus is being raised,
so we can find actual Immortus.

12:01.097 --> 12:05.334
So let's get
a-building, sister.

12:09.169 --> 12:13.009
Whoa, there we go!
And she's back.
Elasti is back.

12:13.009 --> 12:17.246
How could you let me go
to the Ant Farm with you?

12:18.913 --> 12:21.584
You insisted, remember?

12:21.584 --> 12:25.521
But you're the leader.
You should've exercised
better leadership.

12:25.521 --> 12:26.956
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:27.989 --> 12:30.159
Have you any idea
how upset I was

12:30.159 --> 12:33.162
when Wally was smooshed
out of existence?

12:33.162 --> 12:37.466
You know, I was gonna rescue
him from the miserable life
that I sentenced him to.

12:37.466 --> 12:43.072
Are you telling me I've ruined
your chance to redeem yourself

12:43.072 --> 12:46.770
with the person you ordered
to kill my lover?

12:48.776 --> 12:52.348
Whoa there, Nelly.

12:52.348 --> 12:55.884
Let's just press that cancel
and continue button, shall we?

12:55.884 --> 12:58.821
Because, you know what?
You and I were good.

12:58.821 --> 13:02.158
We were on the path
to goodness.

13:02.158 --> 13:08.297
Remember?
Little girls, holding hands?
Sweet as sugar pie?

13:08.297 --> 13:14.537
Let's not let one little
smooshy hiccup
take us two steps back.

13:14.537 --> 13:18.574
What do you say?
You know, we could just take
a deep, cleansing breath

13:18.574 --> 13:20.709
and just, you know,
release the tension.

13:20.709 --> 13:25.414
I'm not feeling very in
control of my emotions
right now,

13:25.414 --> 13:29.252
so you might not want to be
in the same room as me.

13:29.252 --> 13:35.391
In fact, I'm feeling
a bit bloaty,
if you know what I mean.

13:35.391 --> 13:36.325
Okay.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.931
- Do you want me to shut...
- [yells] Shut the door!

13:41.931 --> 13:43.066
[door closes]

13:52.607 --> 13:55.778
[Wally] I was miserable
at the Ant Farm.

13:55.778 --> 13:59.882
Imprisoned and forced
to create monstrous weapons.

13:59.882 --> 14:04.187
That's when Niles Caulder
introduced me
to the Immortus project.

14:04.187 --> 14:07.056
Of course, Niles was involved
in this shitshow.

14:07.056 --> 14:09.158
Fucking Niles.

14:09.158 --> 14:16.665
He said there was a piece
of an ancient, immortal being
somewhere in the world.

14:16.665 --> 14:20.236
He wanted me
to create a creature
that could sniff it out.

14:20.236 --> 14:23.172
Like one of those
corpse-sniffing dogs?

14:23.172 --> 14:26.475
Yes, exactly. Very good, Cliff.

14:27.709 --> 14:29.412
What?

14:29.412 --> 14:30.980
At first, I refused.

14:30.980 --> 14:35.051
But then, he told me
about the girl
with powers like mine.

14:36.785 --> 14:37.786
He needed a piece

14:37.786 --> 14:41.290
of this being to protect her.

14:41.290 --> 14:44.560
It was a chance for me
to finally do something good.

14:47.662 --> 14:50.033
[Donkey braying]

14:50.033 --> 14:52.568
What the fuck?

14:52.568 --> 14:56.639
Months after,
Niles returned to tell me

14:56.639 --> 14:58.174
Peanut Butter was successful.

14:58.174 --> 15:01.444
- The fuck's Peanut Butter?
- The donkey, dipshit.

15:01.444 --> 15:04.347
- Oh.
- [Wally] Niles showed me
the piece

15:04.347 --> 15:08.851
of this immortal being.
The Lord Immortus.

15:08.851 --> 15:11.154
- That's when I saw it.
- What?

15:12.587 --> 15:14.457
Everything.

15:14.457 --> 15:18.962
- Everything?
- Immortus can create
new possibilities

15:19.928 --> 15:21.397
for everyone.

15:21.397 --> 15:24.833
All that's left now,
is you, Cliff.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.931
I want you to see for yourself

15:27.635 --> 15:28.972
what I saw.

15:30.571 --> 15:32.108
The possibilities.

15:33.674 --> 15:38.447
I don't know what to say,
except fuck that, and fuck you.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.355
Booyeah.

15:47.656 --> 15:48.524
You ready?

15:49.057 --> 15:50.259
Hell yeah.

15:50.759 --> 15:51.995
[chuckles]

15:54.328 --> 15:55.198
Oh.

15:56.964 --> 15:58.334
Who wants a taste?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.770
Eat shit, you motherf...

16:01.770 --> 16:03.706
Whoa!

16:04.939 --> 16:06.642
I'm all good, man.
[coughs]

16:06.642 --> 16:08.044
Get 'em, Vic.

16:11.980 --> 16:15.051
[clanking]

16:15.051 --> 16:19.388
[grunting]

16:32.733 --> 16:36.672
- You okay, D?
- [groans] I think
I broke my ass.

16:37.805 --> 16:39.575
Not as easy as it looks, huh?

16:39.575 --> 16:41.777
Nope. Ugh.
Not like that at all.

16:43.077 --> 16:46.010
- Here, take it.
- No.

16:46.010 --> 16:49.418
What? What do you mean, no?
Bro, they're coming.
Just take it.

16:49.418 --> 16:50.386
I said no!

16:54.122 --> 16:56.692
Is that Niles' longevity
necklace?

16:56.692 --> 16:59.462
It is. I got it from
a fellow acolyte.

17:00.094 --> 17:01.864
Touch it.

17:01.864 --> 17:03.432
And see your possibilities.

17:06.434 --> 17:08.871
Whatever.
Touch the stupid thing.

17:08.871 --> 17:13.037
So George RR Windbag can
shut the fart up and we can
get the fuck out of here.

17:13.037 --> 17:17.213
Really? 'Cause a minute ago,
you told him to fuck
himself sideways.

17:17.213 --> 17:20.816
Do you wanna touch
this weirdo's shriveled up
dick charm or not?

17:22.718 --> 17:23.752
- Okay.
- Cool.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.595
The fuck?

17:36.831 --> 17:38.301
[grunting]

17:46.942 --> 17:48.444
I got your back, D.

17:48.444 --> 17:50.379
Put your weight on your
back leg to absorb the kick.

17:50.379 --> 17:51.814
Use the top of
the notch to aim.

17:51.814 --> 17:52.815
Fire!

17:54.949 --> 17:55.818
Nice!

17:59.721 --> 18:02.086
[both grunting]

18:09.831 --> 18:10.699
Damn it!

18:12.000 --> 18:14.203
[both panting]

18:17.834 --> 18:18.774
Let's go get Larry.

18:21.276 --> 18:24.647
[muttering indistinctly]

18:24.647 --> 18:25.648
Fucking hell.

18:27.549 --> 18:28.417
Ah!

18:29.183 --> 18:30.786
Wow, she lives,

18:31.786 --> 18:33.156
she moves.

18:35.023 --> 18:36.692
Feeling better?

18:36.692 --> 18:37.626
[groans softly]

18:45.266 --> 18:48.104
- How about now?
- [sighs]

18:48.104 --> 18:50.773
Okay, sulking
begets more sulking.

18:50.773 --> 18:53.176
So it's time you got
back on the proverbial.

18:53.176 --> 18:55.078
I'm not sulking.

18:55.078 --> 19:00.449
Just reached a realization,
which I'm embracing wholeheartedly.

19:01.715 --> 19:04.148
Everything I touch
turns to shit.

19:04.148 --> 19:05.354
Not literally.

19:05.354 --> 19:07.256
That would be disgusting.

19:07.256 --> 19:11.760
But it... In some ways,
it would be better

19:11.760 --> 19:14.530
than how I actually
turn things to shit.

19:14.530 --> 19:19.435
Hmm, okay, well, you know Rita,
my personal track record
isn't that much better.

19:19.435 --> 19:23.872
I have failed at most
things I've tried.

19:23.872 --> 19:27.476
Revenge against Niles.
Joining the Brotherhood
of Evil.

19:27.476 --> 19:32.415
Being a good friend
to the only people
I've ever really cared about.

19:32.415 --> 19:38.487
But the thing is, in life you
are either trying to head up
or trying to head down.

19:38.487 --> 19:42.926
And sometimes just trying
has got to be good enough.

19:42.926 --> 19:45.929
Now our friends are in trouble,
and I would rather fail

19:45.929 --> 19:52.135
at trying to save them
than succeed at doing nothing.

19:52.135 --> 19:56.973
When we were trapped
in my movie and you
didn't try to save me,

19:56.973 --> 19:59.775
was that you trying
to head up or trying
to head down?

20:04.412 --> 20:07.783
I wanted to help,
but I couldn't.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.521
I couldn't figure out how.

20:14.054 --> 20:18.327
So, I had a few drinks to get
the creative juices flowing

20:18.327 --> 20:25.001
and instead, I came up
with creative ideas
on how to continue drinking.

20:26.034 --> 20:26.970
But, um...

20:28.336 --> 20:29.705
[clicks tongue]

20:29.705 --> 20:33.376
You're right to remind me
of that failure, too.

20:45.086 --> 20:47.023
[sighs]

20:47.023 --> 20:48.357
[clears throat]

20:50.658 --> 20:52.728
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:55.262 --> 21:01.404
And sometimes I think that
the universe is conspiring
to keep us enemies.

21:02.669 --> 21:04.673
I was thinking maybe
we shouldn't let it.

21:11.613 --> 21:13.316
Fuck the universe.

21:14.882 --> 21:18.054
- [glasses clinking]
- [chuckles]

21:18.054 --> 21:20.789
I don't know what the fuck
this is, but I'm glad
you came with me.

21:20.789 --> 21:22.926
I didn't want
to come here, dipshit.

21:22.926 --> 21:25.694
I was trying to gank
the longevity necklace.

21:25.694 --> 21:27.030
Why?

21:27.030 --> 21:28.998
For longevity, asshole!

21:28.998 --> 21:30.599
Isn't that why we're here?

21:30.599 --> 21:33.002
- What about Larry?
- Him, too.

21:34.970 --> 21:35.804
What the fuck?

21:35.804 --> 21:38.341
Paper goods,
the worst aisle.

21:38.341 --> 21:41.177
This is my
world of possibilities.

21:41.177 --> 21:42.478
Forget all this.

21:42.478 --> 21:44.580
We need to get
the hell out of here.

21:44.580 --> 21:45.581
Yep.

21:46.881 --> 21:47.750
Dad!

21:48.249 --> 21:49.252
Clara?

21:49.252 --> 21:50.819
Is Rory with you?

21:50.819 --> 21:53.722
- What?
- Dad, where the hell is Rory?

21:53.722 --> 21:56.320
- Uh, oh...
- Cliff, this isn't real.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.127
Uh, he's not with you?

21:58.127 --> 22:00.263
Does it look like he's with me?

22:00.263 --> 22:02.298
You were supposed
to be watching him.

22:02.298 --> 22:07.036
- Cliff.
- Rory! Rory, honey!

22:07.036 --> 22:08.204
What is this?

22:08.204 --> 22:09.605
This is bullshit,
is what it is.

22:09.605 --> 22:13.609
- But... but...
- But... but, this is a lie.

22:13.609 --> 22:15.111
Okay? Don't get sucked in.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.313
Yeah.

22:17.313 --> 22:19.882
Dad, help me.

22:19.882 --> 22:22.418
- Cliff. Don't--
- Coming, sweetheart!

22:23.050 --> 22:23.920
Fuck!

22:25.720 --> 22:29.892
[Derek] That was so dope!
Why would you ever wanna
give this hero gig up?

22:29.892 --> 22:31.327
[chuckles]

22:31.327 --> 22:33.930
Hey, you know,
Calvin and Marcus
could have seen us.

22:33.930 --> 22:35.359
Uh-huh.

22:35.359 --> 22:38.501
Man, bro. You still don't know
what this means to people.

22:38.501 --> 22:40.836
You're right. I don't.

22:40.836 --> 22:43.739
Back home, you were
bigger than Superman.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.041
Great.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.342
Yo, what's up, man?

22:46.342 --> 22:47.710
Doesn't this mean
anything to you?

22:47.710 --> 22:49.178
Yo, man, I'm so sick
and tired of hearing

22:49.178 --> 22:50.980
what being Cyborg means
to you and everyone else.

22:50.980 --> 22:52.982
Do you want to know
what my tech meant to me?

22:52.982 --> 22:56.953
It meant waking up
from the darkest,
emptiest sleep I ever had,

22:56.953 --> 23:00.523
to a body that
I didn't even recognize
and a face that wasn't mine.

23:01.690 --> 23:03.759
Yo, I lost everything.

23:03.759 --> 23:08.731
My mom, football, girls,
and my friends.

23:08.731 --> 23:11.134
That's such bullshit.

23:11.134 --> 23:12.568
You never lost us. You left us.

23:12.568 --> 23:14.703
You really don't think
I wanted to see you guys?

23:15.369 --> 23:16.605
That I needed you?

23:17.572 --> 23:19.075
Shit, you was my family.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.045
I couldn't even look
myself in the face.

23:22.045 --> 23:24.547
So how could I have
possibly faced y'all?

23:30.385 --> 23:31.587
I didn't know.

23:34.355 --> 23:35.591
I'm sorry.

23:41.057 --> 23:42.098
Come on, man.

24:02.551 --> 24:03.686
[Vic] Hey,

24:06.020 --> 24:08.491
Vic and... friend.

24:09.024 --> 24:09.993
Derick.

24:09.993 --> 24:11.694
What... What are you
guys doing here?

24:13.427 --> 24:16.832
C'mon, I know
you wanna say it.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.003
Really?

24:20.003 --> 24:22.972
Bro, this is a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

24:29.910 --> 24:31.714
Come with us
if you want to live.

24:35.684 --> 24:36.920
I don't think so.

24:42.356 --> 24:45.962
Well, that... that looks
fucking terrifying,
is how it looks.

24:45.962 --> 24:47.796
[Rita laughs]

24:47.796 --> 24:50.466
It looks like the door
to a nightmare.

24:50.466 --> 24:54.637
It does, it does, and we're
going to go through it,
like fucking morons.

24:54.637 --> 24:56.839
Like fucking morons!

24:56.839 --> 25:00.243
Not morons, like superheroes.

25:00.243 --> 25:02.506
[both laughing]

25:02.506 --> 25:04.180
I've actually got
something to tell you.

25:04.180 --> 25:06.916
- Oh, God, that sounds serious.
- Mm-hmm.

25:07.748 --> 25:09.385
It is... It is quite serious.

25:09.385 --> 25:11.454
By the way, um, I...

25:11.454 --> 25:16.392
you know when you would
treat me particularly poorly,
which was quite often...

25:16.392 --> 25:21.564
- Mm.
- I would do a secret naughty
thing with your toothbrush.

25:21.564 --> 25:24.200
I don't need to know.
[chuckles]

25:24.200 --> 25:28.204
I would transform
myself into a wee beaver

25:28.204 --> 25:32.641
with big beaver teeth,
big nasty beaver teeth,

25:32.641 --> 25:36.279
and I would shove it
right up my wee...

25:36.279 --> 25:40.049
I would shove it... Shove it!
Right up my wee beaver-beaver.

25:40.049 --> 25:40.984
[both laugh]

25:43.284 --> 25:44.687
[claps] I see.

25:44.687 --> 25:46.222
[softly] I'm so sorry.

25:46.222 --> 25:48.891
Well, I suppose, um...
[clears throat]

25:48.891 --> 25:51.494
I have something
to confess to you as well.

25:51.494 --> 25:54.097
Hmm. Is it?
Is it about a toothbrush?

25:54.097 --> 25:55.198
[laughs]

25:56.897 --> 26:00.769
Wally isn't the first person
that I've killed.

26:00.769 --> 26:04.941
Killed The Brain too.
Murdered, to be more accurate.

26:04.941 --> 26:07.843
And I don't feel
remotely bad about it.

26:07.843 --> 26:10.213
I'm not feeling entirely
bad about Wally either.

26:10.213 --> 26:14.650
And yes, I did
watch him kill Malcolm,

26:14.650 --> 26:22.225
but one would think
that a normal person would have
more than a pang of guilt, hmm?

26:22.225 --> 26:25.161
Well but, who's to say
you're not normal?

26:25.161 --> 26:26.495
Hey, who's to say?

26:26.495 --> 26:28.764
I... [chuckles nervously]
also...

26:30.398 --> 26:31.400
[clears throat]

26:31.400 --> 26:33.402
killed a sleazeball producer.

26:33.402 --> 26:39.842
[clears throat] Again,
accidentally, and again,
without much remorse.

26:39.842 --> 26:44.013
Apparently, a superhero
doesn't make a habit

26:44.013 --> 26:47.783
of killing people,
accidentally or otherwise.

26:47.783 --> 26:50.353
So, it just
all might have been

26:50.353 --> 26:53.990
a fool's errand
for me to try to become one.
[chuckles]

26:53.990 --> 26:58.962
Oh, all of this, why I keep
rambling on is just to say,

26:58.962 --> 27:01.364
I am in no particular position

27:01.364 --> 27:04.934
to have judged you so harshly
after all this time

27:04.934 --> 27:10.206
when I am basically
as bad as you. [chuckles]

27:10.206 --> 27:13.709
As bad as me?
Well, I think
you might be worse.

27:13.709 --> 27:17.046
'Cause you are
a fucking serial killer.

27:17.712 --> 27:18.915
For fuck's sake.

27:21.382 --> 27:23.052
[both laughing]

27:27.088 --> 27:28.457
Yes.

27:28.457 --> 27:29.725
Yes, you are.

27:29.725 --> 27:31.760
You're a fucking serial killer.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.657
I mean... [mimics stabbing]
you know.

27:33.657 --> 27:34.797
[Rita laughs]

27:36.464 --> 27:40.636
What... What is left to do
on this nightmare door?

27:40.636 --> 27:45.208
We dab wacky Wally's green ink.

27:45.208 --> 27:46.642
Oh.

27:46.642 --> 27:51.114
A little dab here
and a little dab there.
[chuckles]

27:55.316 --> 27:58.254
- [Laura sighs]
- There could be anything

27:58.254 --> 28:01.890
on the other side
of this horrific door.

28:03.490 --> 28:05.728
Our friends
are on the other side of it.

28:06.661 --> 28:08.164
[imperceptible]

28:13.168 --> 28:14.770
Okay, after you,
Ms. Wuornos.

28:14.770 --> 28:16.572
[chuckles]

28:16.572 --> 28:18.975
- No, after you.
- After you.

28:18.975 --> 28:20.443
- After you.
- After you.

28:26.848 --> 28:28.084
[Rita] Wait.

28:34.516 --> 28:36.259
Rory, come here, buddy.

28:36.259 --> 28:38.995
- Rory? Rory!
- Cliff, stop!

28:38.995 --> 28:42.031
This isn't real.
None of this is fucking real!

28:42.031 --> 28:44.367
That's not your daughter.
We're not in Trader Blow's,

28:44.367 --> 28:46.335
and you already know
where Rory is.

28:46.335 --> 28:47.870
I know it's not real.

28:47.870 --> 28:50.406
But, it's my possibility,
and I wanna know
what the fuck it is.

28:50.406 --> 28:52.241
God damn it!

28:52.241 --> 28:54.177
If you're going
to be a fucking idiot,
well, can you at least

28:54.177 --> 28:56.212
swing by the home goods aisle
and get a knife or something?

28:56.212 --> 28:58.214
We're going to need it
when we get back to Dorkwith.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.183
[man] That's fucking heavy.

29:00.183 --> 29:01.217
Grab that.

29:03.284 --> 29:04.253

He's all grown up.

29:27.743 --> 29:32.515
What the fuck, Rory?
Are you trying to destroy me?
Because it's working.

29:32.515 --> 29:38.421
- He's fucking perfect.
- Cliff, stop right-fucking-now!

29:38.421 --> 29:40.289
He's only like this
when you're around, Dad.

29:40.289 --> 29:43.960
You've undermined
my parenting at every turn.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.529
And now my child
doesn't respect me.

29:46.529 --> 29:49.999
When has a fantasy sequence
ever worked out for us?

29:51.466 --> 29:52.468
Pop-pop!

30:07.549 --> 30:09.352
Rory! Rory!

30:10.584 --> 30:12.288
What happened? Where'd he go?

30:12.288 --> 30:13.856
He's right where you left him.

30:13.856 --> 30:15.424
He's waiting for you.

30:15.424 --> 30:17.493
And you can enjoy
the formative years

30:17.493 --> 30:20.396
of his life with sound
body and mind.

30:20.396 --> 30:23.299
But it's a possibility
only Immortus can provide.

30:30.538 --> 30:31.440
- [grunts]
- Argh.

30:34.274 --> 30:36.379
What are you doing?
Let's get the fuck out of here.

30:38.012 --> 30:40.583
[Jane] What? No!

30:41.416 --> 30:42.351
Cliff.

30:45.887 --> 30:48.257
You stupid metal asshole!

30:49.691 --> 30:51.194
Don't do this! Don't--

30:52.160 --> 30:53.762
Don't hurt her.

30:53.762 --> 30:57.934
Cliff, you know what this means
for the rest of us, right?

30:57.934 --> 31:00.169
We're your family too, Cliff.

31:01.563 --> 31:03.206
You fucking moron!

31:05.474 --> 31:06.409
Please!

31:07.141 --> 31:08.377
Rory needs you.

31:09.376 --> 31:10.379
I need you.

[ground shaking]

31:20.955 --> 31:22.491
Guys,

31:22.491 --> 31:23.659
something's happening.

31:23.659 --> 31:25.028
Safe travels, fellas.

31:25.028 --> 31:26.629
Larry, stop screwing around.

31:26.629 --> 31:28.697
I'm not screwing around.

31:28.697 --> 31:33.036
Look, you need to understand
that what Keeg saw
in the future was not good.

31:33.036 --> 31:37.040
So not good that
he'd rather stay here
in this phony hellhole,

31:37.040 --> 31:39.408
if there's a chance
we can avoid it.

31:39.408 --> 31:43.679
And I cannot and will not
let another child of mine down.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.883
I'd rather die
than do that again.

31:47.883 --> 31:52.055
Okay, look, this is important
to Keeg and you're trying to be
a good dad. I get it.

31:52.055 --> 31:55.391
But something really
not good is going to happen
right here, right now.

31:55.391 --> 31:59.095
You're willing to risk
your life for Keeg's wish,
and that's fine.

31:59.095 --> 32:01.264
But are you willing
to risk his life too?

32:02.197 --> 32:04.833
[sighs] Hey, pal.

32:04.833 --> 32:07.270
- Come on, let's go!

Get up!

32:08.933 --> 32:10.839
We can break free.
We can still do this.

Please don't let
this be the end!

32:12.875 --> 32:14.010
[chanting continues]

32:21.882 --> 32:24.949
I know I'm putting my faith
in a whole lot of nothing.

32:24.949 --> 32:27.952
But, I'm doing this
for you, Rory.

32:29.958 --> 32:31.294

33:43.900 --> 33:45.568
The time is upon us.

33:46.568 --> 33:48.404
Immortus is nigh!

Hello! Is anybody home?

34:12.056 --> 34:14.530

34:14.530 --> 34:16.765
Oh, wow!

It's like a disco in here.

Ooh, hey, there's Cliffy!
Let's go rescue him.

34:22.805 --> 34:25.574
Ooh yes, let's go get Cliffy.

34:25.574 --> 34:29.946
- We are your Rescue Rangers.
- It's time to go, right?

34:29.946 --> 34:33.416
It's too late.
You can't stop it.

34:33.416 --> 34:35.952
Stop that shit. Stop that shit.

Father, you don't
have to do this.

35:11.154 --> 35:12.321
How can this be?

35:12.321 --> 35:14.090
I never brought you to life.

35:14.090 --> 35:16.859
No. You just drew me
into an endless war
with my father.

35:16.859 --> 35:18.122
She gave me life.

35:18.926 --> 35:21.197
Jane.

35:21.197 --> 35:23.566
- Are you all right?
- What the hell are you
doing here?

Are you Wally Sage?

You're the girl.

Niles' girl.

It's all come full circle.
