00:12.186 --> 00:16.494
[clears throat]
That hit the spot.Oh, my God.

00:16.538 --> 00:17.756
Listen,
we're definitely gonna need

00:17.800 --> 00:19.932
to start our ranch boot camp
back up. ASAP.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.370
Agreed. That was...
that was dense.Man.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.154
Oh, come on,
Green Juice. Calm down.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.460
You have all day

00:25.503 --> 00:27.418
to work that off
now that you're unemployed.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.725
TREY:
Oh, yeah. When are we gonna
start seeing the billboards

00:29.768 --> 00:31.640
for Liam Walker, Esquire?Yeah.

00:31.683 --> 00:35.296
If I do private practice,
I'm gonna need new clientele.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.385
Hey, are you gonna
get that new place

00:37.428 --> 00:39.169
now that your lease is up?Yes.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.606
A lot of memories
tied to that one, so...

00:41.650 --> 00:44.653
Hey, why don't you two
move in together?

00:44.696 --> 00:45.915
Seriously.
Think about it. You know,

00:45.958 --> 00:47.525
a change of scenery,
do you both good.

00:47.569 --> 00:48.874
You split the rent.
Then you guys

00:48.918 --> 00:50.485
wouldn't have to be so alone.LIAM:Well,

00:50.528 --> 00:53.183
I think that we are comfortable
in our alone-ness.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.837
What about you, Cordell?
A-Are you comfortable?

00:54.880 --> 00:57.970
Oh, I'm not alone.
I-I live in a crowded house

00:58.014 --> 01:00.364
with teenagers. I'm never alone.

01:00.408 --> 01:03.411
Alone is different than
being lonely, Cordi.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.717
I'm just saying, we're
not the ones texting

01:05.761 --> 01:06.892
every second of our downtime.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.720
TREY:
Right. Or driving across town

01:08.764 --> 01:10.809
just 'cause you don't
like eating by yourself.All right.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.290
Fair. Yes, sure,

01:13.334 --> 01:16.728
working alone
h-has been different.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.730
You know? No one

01:18.774 --> 01:20.210
to cover your blind spots.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.733
N-No one to share with.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.866
It's-it's quiet.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.911
Lonely?Lonely? Ah. Jinx.

01:25.955 --> 01:29.393
All right. Well,
since Ihave to go to work,

01:29.437 --> 01:30.742
I'm-a head out.

01:30.786 --> 01:33.832
Uh, sorry to ruin your date,
but it's on the house.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.921
See you later.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.967
That man really needs to get...

01:38.010 --> 01:39.882
a partner.I know.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.623
[sighs]

01:41.666 --> 01:43.668
[truck door closes,
engine starts]

01:46.671 --> 01:48.325
So, you nervous
about your brother?

01:48.369 --> 01:51.023
Or is there something else
going on?

01:51.067 --> 01:52.634
Man, you're sharp.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.897
I was looking at,
uh, land surveys

01:54.940 --> 01:57.726
on our property.Is this
about the Davidsons?

01:57.769 --> 02:00.381
Listen,
between three generations

02:00.424 --> 02:03.427
of Walkers, you...
you tend to overhear a lot.

02:03.471 --> 02:06.430
Yeah. Well,
the records that I need are

02:06.474 --> 02:09.041
at the county assessor's office.And let me guess.
You don't want

02:09.085 --> 02:11.783
to bump into any
former coworkers at the courts.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.350
You're getting sharper
by the minute.
Well,

02:13.394 --> 02:17.528
I'm free today,
so what do you need?

02:17.572 --> 02:18.834
You know, maybe my brother's
not the only one

02:18.877 --> 02:20.052
who needs a partner.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.369
[grunts softly]

02:32.413 --> 02:33.979
You waiting for an invite?

02:34.023 --> 02:35.546
Huh?

02:35.590 --> 02:37.983
No, I just, uh--
something in my shoe.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.028
I'm guessing you want to know

02:39.071 --> 02:40.334
how the new Ranger search
is going.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.987
Yeah, sure.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.338
It's gonna take
some time, man.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.862
Trooper Jackson's
a solid candidate. Fleming.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.560
Uh, Officer Carver. Monroe.

02:49.604 --> 02:53.085
It's about a dozen good ones.
I just got to be careful.

02:53.129 --> 02:55.305
Uh, careful that they
share your same approach

02:55.349 --> 02:56.915
to law enforcement.
I get that.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.527
Well, and someone who's...
you know.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.485
Someone
who's a good match for you.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.661
Yeah, of course.

03:03.705 --> 03:04.706
In the meantime...

03:05.794 --> 03:08.100
Right.While I'm looking
for a real Ranger,

03:08.144 --> 03:09.798
I need you to find a fake one.

03:09.841 --> 03:12.409
Sorry?Got multiple reports
from APD

03:12.453 --> 03:13.758
in the last 24 hours

03:13.802 --> 03:16.021
about somebody posing
as Texas Ranger Miles Vyas.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.328
Miles Vyas?

03:18.372 --> 03:20.461
The Ranger in Dallas
reported missing

03:20.504 --> 03:22.071
about six months
ago, presumed dead?

03:22.114 --> 03:24.378
So, there's no ID
from the footage,

03:24.421 --> 03:25.683
but this is
definitely his MO.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.512
He flashes a badge,
claims civil forfeiture

03:28.556 --> 03:29.905
and then jacks people's cars

03:29.948 --> 03:32.342
in the name
of some made-up investigation.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.953
Oh, it looks like a-a Bentley.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.346
All right.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.695
Well, we got to find him

03:37.739 --> 03:38.957
before he does
something worse.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.698
Yougot to find him.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.700
You're flying solo on this one.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.660
Okay. All right. Well, I'll-I'll
shake down the local chop shops.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.662
Might, uh, might get a lead

03:47.705 --> 03:49.707
on a buyer in the market
for high-end stolen cars.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.927
There you go. Maybe you
don't need a partner after all.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.450
Well, I...

03:53.494 --> 03:54.495
I'm joking.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.539
Hmm.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.714
I'm looking.Well,

03:56.758 --> 03:58.586
if anyone can find me

03:58.629 --> 04:00.979
the right new partner,
it's my old partner.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.460
I got you, buddy.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.201
I know you do.
[clears throat]

04:06.507 --> 04:08.987
Bye.Yep.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.729
All right. What are
the plans later?

04:11.773 --> 04:14.079
Yeah, anyone hear
about any parties?STELLA: Oh,

04:14.123 --> 04:15.646
I heard Robin's throwing one.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.822
Straightjackets
is playing the Majestic.COLTON: Oh,

04:17.866 --> 04:20.651
I didn't even know they
were touring. [chuckles]FAYE: And...

04:20.695 --> 04:22.000
they're sold out.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.569
Well, uh, I can
probably get us tickets.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.919
What are you? Are you,
like, the opening act

04:27.963 --> 04:29.138
or something?

04:29.181 --> 04:30.400
Need you to write
more songs first.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.749
But, no, my uncle,

04:31.793 --> 04:32.794
he's a silent investor.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.056
He can get us in.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.449
What do you think?COLTON:
Uh,

04:35.492 --> 04:37.929
fifth wheel?
Yeah, no, I'll-I'll pass.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.409
Colton, come on.

04:39.453 --> 04:40.584
Straightjackets is

04:40.628 --> 04:41.803
one of your favorite bands.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.761
Yeah, you know me so well.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.763
All right, fine.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.635
Now, where do you
guys want to meet?

04:49.898 --> 04:51.639
[chuckles]:
Oh, thanks.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.032
[indistinct chatter]

04:54.076 --> 04:55.730
Oh.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.036
Hey, Charlie, Bonham's
a little short-staffed

04:58.080 --> 04:59.516
at the ranch,
so if any of your boys

04:59.560 --> 05:00.996
need work, send them our way.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.867
You got it, Abby.All right. Thank you.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.087
Oh!

05:05.130 --> 05:07.959
Oh! My. Oh. [chuckles][chuckles] Gale.

05:08.003 --> 05:10.614
Well, lucky for us, no one
was holding a cauldron of chili.

05:10.658 --> 05:13.878
[chuckles] That's-that's funny.
Haven't seen you since. Yeah.

05:14.966 --> 05:17.491
This is the best market
in town, isn't it?Oh, yeah.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.841
Um, I was hoping the
spice selection would be

05:19.884 --> 05:22.452
a little more varied.
I need it for the Barn Burner.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.193
At The Side Step?Yeah.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.804
Colton stopped by.
He said the chili was lacking.

05:26.848 --> 05:29.154
Got to, you know, maintain
the family recipe.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.461
[chuckles]
Right.Yeah.

05:31.505 --> 05:35.160
You know, uh,
Colton has been by the house,

05:35.204 --> 05:36.901
and he and August

05:36.945 --> 05:38.468
were working on their music.Yeah.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.601
He's such a sweet kid.Aw.

05:40.644 --> 05:43.473
Thank you. Thank you.And talented.
You know, I taught them

05:43.517 --> 05:45.693
that song
that Marv used to sing.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.045
I'm sorry.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.176
I shouldn't have said that.You know,

05:51.220 --> 05:53.091
you always overstepped.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.659
You always thought
you were better than me.

05:55.703 --> 05:58.053
Than us.
Talking about my dead husband.

05:58.096 --> 06:00.795
Acting like your family had
nothing to do with it. I hope...

06:00.838 --> 06:02.884
It's... it's fine.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.842
I'm sorry.I appreciate you welcoming

06:04.886 --> 06:07.105
Colton into your home. I do.

Doing great.It's a nice car.

You the buyer?

07:24.356 --> 07:26.010
No, I'm not. Stop talking.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.185
Do what I say

07:27.229 --> 07:28.622
and pop the trunk.Listen,

07:28.665 --> 07:31.755
you're making a big mistake.
I'm a Texas Ranger.

07:31.799 --> 07:32.930
Or maybe you're not a Ranger.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.584
Because you just stepped

07:34.628 --> 07:36.194
out of a stolen car,

07:36.238 --> 07:38.588
and that is not a good look
for you.I see how this looks,

07:38.632 --> 07:40.024
but I can explain, okay?

07:40.068 --> 07:42.113
My truck
is right around the corner.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.593
Down the dark alley over there?

07:43.637 --> 07:44.942
Can't wait to go see.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.945
Right after you do what I say
and pop the trunk.

07:54.648 --> 07:55.953
All right.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.695
Now, you listen to me.
I'm gonna say this once.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.871
You are making a mis...

08:00.915 --> 08:02.786
[electricity zapping][grunting]

08:07.312 --> 08:09.184
Get in there.

08:12.056 --> 08:15.016
I have some questions for you.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.019
â™ª

08:26.680 --> 08:28.159
Are you boosting wheels

08:28.203 --> 08:30.205
for the jackers
from Panhandle Plains?

08:32.207 --> 08:34.775
What are you talking about?

08:34.818 --> 08:37.778
Where'd you get the uniform,
huh? You take it off him?You need to listen to me!

08:37.821 --> 08:39.301
Hey, backseat driver,

08:39.344 --> 08:41.825
I'll listen when you
start giving me answers.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.958
Are you part of the grand theft
auto ring in Lubbock?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.089
I don't know
who the hell you're after,

08:45.133 --> 08:46.351
but I promise it ain't me!

08:50.051 --> 08:53.228
Suspension's a bit stiff on a
car this fancy, don't you think?

08:53.271 --> 08:54.838
But if you keep
dodging my questions,

08:54.882 --> 08:56.840
I promise it gets worse.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.320
There is a Texas Ranger
in your trunk!

08:58.363 --> 09:00.757
Do you have any idea
what's gonna happen to you?

09:05.066 --> 09:07.372

Got it.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.377
What's your point?My point is,

09:55.420 --> 09:56.813
my division captain
is Larry James,

09:56.857 --> 09:57.945
who you need to call

09:57.988 --> 10:01.078
right now
before this gets any worse.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.518
[exhales]

10:08.564 --> 10:10.435
Uh, this is, uh, Ranger Perez.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.002
Ranger Perez.Currently on a leave of absence

10:12.046 --> 10:13.482
from
the Dallas Rangers Division.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.875
I'm calling for Captain James,
please.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.093
JAMES:
You got him.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.487
I am calling
in regards to a Ranger

10:18.530 --> 10:21.272
under your command,
a Cordell Walker.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.187
Yes. May I ask what case
he is currently assigned?

10:23.231 --> 10:25.189
JAMES:
He's working a 37.11. Why?

10:25.233 --> 10:27.583
And is he the type
who would

10:27.627 --> 10:30.455
blindly pull a car's e-brake

10:30.499 --> 10:32.501
from inside the trunk,
knowing

10:32.544 --> 10:35.330
it would send it
into an uncontrolled skid?

10:35.373 --> 10:37.071
JAMES: Yep. That sounds
like Ranger Walker.

10:37.114 --> 10:40.465
You don't say.
I appreciate your time, sir.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.467
"Appreciate your time."

10:48.691 --> 10:52.608
Well, I think I made
a little mistake, Ranger Walker.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.655
Agreed, Ranger Perez.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.569
Call me Cassie.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.186
Hey, uh, excuse me.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.057
Can I get the assessment records

11:07.101 --> 11:09.146
for 2105 Broken Trace Road?CLERK:
Yeah.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.408
That your property?

11:10.452 --> 11:11.627
Uh, no.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.715
Uh, not exactly.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.154
Contractor, huh? I can
always spot a contractor.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.547
Y'all always got

11:18.590 --> 11:20.680
those big biceps.[laughs]

11:21.768 --> 11:24.205
What's the address again, sugar?Uh,

11:24.248 --> 11:25.467
yeah. Right here.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.512
Appreciate that.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.081
It feels
like I've turned a new leaf.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.519
You know, my whole outlook is...
It's more positive.

11:34.563 --> 11:37.479
Which, you know, it wasn't...

11:37.522 --> 11:39.220
Oh. Hey, Gale.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.048
I'm so sorry,
we're not open yet.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.093
Oh, don't mind me.
Just, uh, chili spices.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.574
Yeah. Okay.I'll meet you
in the kitchen in a sec.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.141
I mean,

11:47.184 --> 11:49.012
I still...
I still think about Hoyt.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.014
Of course I do.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.407
You know, I think
about how he died.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.279
But I'm not responsible.
And I'm not gonna let

11:55.323 --> 11:57.020
my past define my future.

11:57.064 --> 12:00.154
I can't anymore.
It's time to move on.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.199
I'm gonna take
a little break.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.293
You know, if you shared your
secret family recipe with me,

12:09.337 --> 12:11.382
you wouldn't have to shop
for chili spices every week.

12:11.426 --> 12:12.601
Well, wouldn't be much

12:12.644 --> 12:14.168
of a secret family recipe then,
would it?

12:14.211 --> 12:16.518
[chuckles]Uh, my system is down.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.172
Is it okay if I pay cash?

12:18.215 --> 12:21.001
My husband
always used to pay cash.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.698
You know, I couldn't help

12:22.742 --> 12:24.395
but, uh, overhear
what you said in there.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.006
I'm sorry.

12:26.049 --> 12:28.660
Oh. Don't apologize.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.707
No, I just... I'm sorry
for what you've been through.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.013
I know a thing or two

12:33.056 --> 12:34.188
about loss.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.539
I heard about your husband.

12:37.582 --> 12:40.411
Yeah, well, I lost a hell
of a lot more than just Marv.

12:40.455 --> 12:44.241
Sounds like you found
more peace in a year

12:44.285 --> 12:46.504
than I have in 20.

12:46.548 --> 12:50.770
Well, you're more than welcome
to join us if you ever want.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.424
Maybe another time.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.037
Thank you.Thank you.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.255
Oh.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.781
I, uh...

13:01.824 --> 13:04.609
I took a hard look at my past.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.439
That's how I found peace.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.486
That's good advice.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.403
WALKER:
You know,

13:15.446 --> 13:17.318
you could've saved us both
some trouble

13:17.361 --> 13:19.581
if you led with,
"Hi there. I'm Ranger Perez.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.584
And you are?"Well, technically,
I'm on a leave of absence.

13:22.627 --> 13:23.846
A leave of absence, yeah?
Well, you're using

13:23.890 --> 13:26.153
your time off really well.
Tasing a Ranger

13:26.196 --> 13:27.589
and shoving him into a trunk?Oh!

13:27.632 --> 13:28.808
Please, I nudged you.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.244
You... [groans]And I tased you because

13:30.287 --> 13:32.072
you're dressed like our perp.I'm not dressed

13:32.115 --> 13:34.465
like our perp.
Our perp is dressed like me.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.076
And he's not "our" perp.[siren wailing]

13:36.119 --> 13:38.556
He's myperp. Mine.
You don't wear a badge.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.255
You were dressed like a Ranger
lurking by a car

13:41.298 --> 13:43.561
that was stolen by someone
impersonating a Ranger.

13:43.605 --> 13:46.477
Anyone would have come
to the same conclusion I did.It ever

13:46.521 --> 13:47.565
occur to you that
your little stunt back there

13:47.609 --> 13:48.610
probably scared away
our suspect?

13:48.653 --> 13:49.741
You said "our suspect."

13:49.785 --> 13:51.091
I said...[car door opens]

13:51.134 --> 13:52.744
You are unbelievable.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.312
On the ground now.
Hands where I can see them.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.966
Thank you, Officer.
I-I got this.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.099
I'm talking to you, too, buddy.
I've located the stolen vehicle

13:59.142 --> 14:01.623
and the 37.11.No, no, no, no.
I-I'm not the imposter.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.798
I'm a Texas Ranger.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.626
Cordell Walker.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.715
This guy thinks he's the Ranger
who's always in the news.

14:06.758 --> 14:07.803
CASSIE:
Told you anyone would have come

14:07.847 --> 14:09.152
to the same conclusion.

14:11.546 --> 14:15.115
Yep. Sure. Uh, let's just, uh...

14:15.158 --> 14:16.246
Let's get this over with.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.255
I have serious doubts
her Taser is even legal.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.214
I think she jailbroke it
to add extra juice

14:27.257 --> 14:29.259
to take out
a guy like me.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.652
[James laughs]

14:30.695 --> 14:33.394
I'm s... She apologized

14:33.437 --> 14:34.569
for the tasing several times.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.136
Mm-hmm.Okay, what about...

14:36.179 --> 14:37.746
what about the-the hitting
the potholes thing?

14:37.789 --> 14:39.704
She didn't apologize for that.Okay, I don't control potholes.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.316
JAMES:
Okay, enough. Okay,
listen, mistakes were made.

14:42.359 --> 14:43.404
She said sorry.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.319
Frankly, anybody in her shoes

14:45.362 --> 14:46.581
would've reached
the same conclusion.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.366
Okay. Cassandra Perez.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.281
You were the youngest cadet

14:51.325 --> 14:54.284
at DPS academy,
graduated top of your class.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.851
First female Ranger
in Dallas

14:55.895 --> 14:57.331
under Captain Cole.CASSIE:Yeah.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.594
He only hired me after
you changed the landscape

14:59.637 --> 15:01.683
after you hired Ranger Ramirez.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.163
JAMES:
Hmm.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.513
But Cole
never really had my back.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.428
So, is that why you took

15:07.471 --> 15:09.169
an indefinite leave of absence
after only

15:09.212 --> 15:10.648
four months on the job?

15:10.692 --> 15:11.519
How is any of this relevant?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.216
Walker...

15:13.260 --> 15:14.652
I, uh, I took a leave

15:14.696 --> 15:17.525
after my partner was abducted
in the line of duty

15:17.568 --> 15:22.747
and my captain designated
Miles "presumed dead."

15:22.791 --> 15:24.706
Okay, I can understand
needing some time off

15:24.749 --> 15:26.186
after losing a partner,
but you've been on leave

15:26.229 --> 15:27.404
for almost
six months now.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.668
Why not return to the force?

15:30.712 --> 15:32.192
Because Miles is still alive.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.717
I don't have the evidence--
I know that-- but...

15:35.760 --> 15:37.545
too much just doesn't add up.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.938
There's more to the story.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.901
Is there any chance you'd want
to help us out on this case?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.251
What? Cap-Captain,
she's not even a Ranger...

15:48.295 --> 15:49.774
I-I don't need help.
I don't need herhelp.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.428
JAMES:
Walker, she's got insight
that we don't.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.909
She's motivated; this guy
is impersonating her partner

15:53.953 --> 15:55.476
and he's still out there.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.913
So I'm asking you to catch him
together, all right?

15:57.957 --> 16:01.003
Captain, I understand
why he needs my help.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.918
That much is clear.Oh, is it clear?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.398
Is it?

16:04.441 --> 16:06.400
Because you,
you've been lone-wolfing it

16:06.443 --> 16:07.836
for, what, six months,

16:07.879 --> 16:09.316
and the closest you've come
to finding Ranger Vyas

16:09.359 --> 16:10.665
is today's screwup?

16:10.708 --> 16:13.581
You're right.
But this case is personal.

16:13.624 --> 16:17.019
So even if it's only temporary,
I can't work with someone

16:17.063 --> 16:18.847
who doesn't bring something
to the table themselves.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.414
WALKER:
I'm a Texas Ranger.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.677
That's what I bring
to the table.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.418
[chuckles]:
Okay, tough guy, but what else?

16:24.461 --> 16:26.681
What makes you a good
partner on this?

16:29.379 --> 16:31.512
I don't need to explain
myself to you.

16:31.555 --> 16:34.689
I don't work with people
I can't trust.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.823
It was a pleasure
meeting you, Captain.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.740
[door opens]

16:42.784 --> 16:44.873
[door closes]

16:48.485 --> 16:49.834
Dude, I can't believe
Todd left us high and dry.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.533
No, we're never
getting in.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.361
Todd's not answering.
I'm worried.

16:54.404 --> 16:55.536
No, don't be.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.146
He probably just
wanted the credit

16:57.190 --> 16:58.974
for getting us tickets and had
no way to actually deliver.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.628
No, that's not Todd.
He wouldn't just...

17:00.671 --> 17:01.803
Stella, yes, he would.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.674
Same way he hogs credit
for our band.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.850
You know that song
at The Side Step?

17:05.894 --> 17:07.330
No, he-he didn't...

17:07.374 --> 17:09.376
Okay, he-he didn't even

17:09.419 --> 17:10.986
get the lyrics
when he read 'em.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.466
AUGUST:
Hey, yo, I-I-I, uh,

17:12.509 --> 17:13.945
I think I just saw
the Straightjackets'

17:13.989 --> 17:15.469
keyboard player over there.
Want to go check it out?

17:15.512 --> 17:17.471
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.Let's do it.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.821
[rock music playing in distance]

17:19.864 --> 17:22.041
I didn't actually see
Kevin VanSchlinker.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.999
I just, um...

17:24.043 --> 17:25.653
I feel like you were
gonna tell my sister

17:25.696 --> 17:27.046
that that song was about her.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.395
Oh, no, I-I wasn't...

17:28.438 --> 17:29.831
She's still not over
Trevor Strand, all right?

17:29.874 --> 17:31.354
Todd's the first guy
after him.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.488
And-and I like Todd,
it's just...

17:34.531 --> 17:35.750
he's kind of a fling.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.534
So she'll be
sick of him

17:37.578 --> 17:38.666
in, like, a week.Okay,

17:38.709 --> 17:40.102
thank-thanks
for the heads-up?Yeah.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.625
Yeah, you know,
I'd hate for you to be

17:41.669 --> 17:42.931
the guy my sister doesn't
want around, all right?

17:42.974 --> 17:45.325
Because starting this band's
been fun.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.762
And so is hanging out, so, uh...

17:49.024 --> 17:51.070
Just let the Todd fling
run its course, yeah.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.637
I'm gonna go check on Todd.Yeah, I-I'm-- I'll drive you.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.558
Thanks.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.778
I'll make sure the techs, uh,
check it for fingerprints

18:03.821 --> 18:05.475
and do a sweep.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.390
I always wanted a car like that.
Kelly said it was impractical.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.696
Not enough trunk space.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.741
Based on your research,

18:10.785 --> 18:12.656
what do you think?Very funny.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.702
Well, off to Paititi
it goes, huh?

18:14.745 --> 18:17.052
Yeah, by the way,
what is that?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.359
The warehouse where DPS keeps
all their asset forfeitures.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.578
Yes, I-I know that,
but, uh, "Paititi."

18:21.622 --> 18:23.406
Wh-What is that, that word?
Where does it come from?

18:23.450 --> 18:25.104
Lost city of gold. Paititi.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.844
Paititi? Paititi.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.107
I don't know.
Huh.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.978
I bet Cassie would
know that one.
[scoffs]

18:30.021 --> 18:32.894
Look, she's not gonna stop
looking for her partner.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.723
You guys are gonna be
on the same path anyway.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.681
Wait, h-hold up, Cap.

18:37.725 --> 18:38.900
You're trying to Parent Trapme.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.816
That's a clear violation
of rule number 42.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.818
Need I remind you,
we made those rules

18:43.861 --> 18:45.646
because we used to fight
all the time

18:45.689 --> 18:46.908
in the beginning.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.518
But we also pushed
each other in the direction

18:48.562 --> 18:50.390
that we needed to be pushed.I'm just saying,

18:50.433 --> 18:52.435
I don't think she has
what it takes.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.437
Well, she's got
what it takes to locate

18:54.481 --> 18:55.786
a stolen vehicle
without department resources.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.397
She's also got
what it takes

18:57.440 --> 18:59.747
to force a moose like you

18:59.790 --> 19:01.836
into the trunk of a car.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.577
Unarmed, mind you.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.753
Uh, she had a Taser.
Please.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.755
She tased me. She...

19:07.798 --> 19:09.670
Okay, all right, all right.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.019
All right, here you go.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.848
Even if I-I agreed
to the partnership--

19:13.891 --> 19:15.197
which is a big "if"--

19:15.241 --> 19:17.982
she didn't show
any indication whatsoever

19:18.026 --> 19:19.767
that she wanted
to partner with me.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.160
What about all those questions
she was asking you?

19:21.203 --> 19:22.596
You don't think
she was trying to get an idea

19:22.639 --> 19:23.771
of what it might be like
to work with you?

19:23.814 --> 19:25.860
Look, if you think
there's a chance--

19:25.903 --> 19:28.602
because I do--
you got to meet her halfway.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.952
You can't just wait for her
to come knocking on your door,

19:30.995 --> 19:32.562
asking to work with you.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.521
[knocking on door]

19:36.697 --> 19:38.133
Can I help you?CASSIE:
Good day, ma'am.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.135
I'm here about
the ranch hand position.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.180
Oh.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.925
CASSIE:
Wow, that's one hell
of a spread.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.449
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't give
you the full tour, but, um,

19:49.492 --> 19:52.234
you came in
kind of late, so... Oh.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.409
Liam.Yeah.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.803
I didn't realize
you were home.

19:55.846 --> 19:56.978
Yeah, Mama, I thought I'd cook

19:57.021 --> 19:58.545
dinner for you
since Dad's out of town.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.460
Sorry, I'm-I'm
being rude.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.113
I'm Liam.Cassandra.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.028
And I know who you are.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.073
I voted for you for D.A.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.162
It's a shame
you didn't win.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.686
That new D.A.?

20:11.601 --> 20:13.560
Uh, well, I have some pots
on the stove right now,

20:13.603 --> 20:15.214
but it was very
nice to meet you.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.477
And I hope to see you around.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.608
Likewise.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.656
Hey, you have another son.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.048
Didn't I hear that?Cordell.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.136
Huh.
Yes.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.138
He's a Texas Ranger.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.531
CASSIE:
A Ranger?

20:28.575 --> 20:30.054
He never considered ranching?

20:30.098 --> 20:31.969
Well, not for very long.
He took a leave from the Rangers

20:32.013 --> 20:34.624
once to focus on family,
this place, but...

20:34.668 --> 20:37.018
What did his partner think
when he left?

20:37.061 --> 20:38.933
His partner?

20:41.240 --> 20:45.026
Well, um, she was
pretty much family

20:45.069 --> 20:46.201
at that point.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.768
She understood.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.987
She had Cordell's back,
he had hers.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.946
And I think it's what
gave her the strength

20:51.989 --> 20:53.817
to put down the
badge herself.

20:53.861 --> 20:56.080
But she will always have
a place at our table.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.520
Are there any
other questions?

21:00.563 --> 21:03.087
Uh, I'm sorry.
Am I being too nosy?

21:03.131 --> 21:05.699
For a ranch hand?
Well, I'd say so.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.135
But you are no ranch hand.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.312
You don't know the difference
between a muck fork

21:10.356 --> 21:11.966
and a pitchfork,

21:12.009 --> 21:15.665
and the only thing you seem
really interested in is Cordell,

21:15.709 --> 21:17.319
who's itching for a new partner.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.799
May I hazard a guess?

21:18.842 --> 21:20.627
Ranger candidate?

21:20.670 --> 21:25.240
Well, I see where your son gets
his perceptive qualities.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.720
[laughs softly]

21:26.763 --> 21:30.898
I mean... the woman
has a screw loose.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.117
I have serious doubts
she'd have the wherewithal

21:33.161 --> 21:36.338
to muck a stable,
let alone be-be my partner.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.035
GERI:
Well, you're not gonna want
to hear this, Walker.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.341
"Walker"?

21:39.385 --> 21:41.996
What, I'm not gonna want
to hear what, Broussard?

21:42.039 --> 21:45.565
Okay. Uh, I'm surprised
that you don't relate.

21:45.608 --> 21:49.177
It sounds like
she only did what she did

21:49.220 --> 21:50.700
because she thought
that you were responsible

21:50.744 --> 21:52.267
for her partner's
disappearance.

21:52.311 --> 21:56.227
I mean, isn't that the same
thing that you did to Stan

21:56.271 --> 21:58.317
when you found out that
he was responsible for Emily?

21:58.360 --> 22:01.276
No, I-I didn't...
I didn't put him in the trunk.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.104
No, you didn't put him
in the trunk, but you did

22:03.147 --> 22:05.149
hold him at gunpoint
in the passenger seat.

22:05.193 --> 22:08.936
Look, I am on your side.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.764
â™ª

22:10.807 --> 22:12.809
but just because
your last partnership

22:12.853 --> 22:14.245
didn't work out doesn't mean

22:14.289 --> 22:16.683
that this one is gonna end
the same way.

22:16.726 --> 22:19.163
Okay? Give her a chance.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.646
Come on.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.169
How do you always know
what to say?

22:26.214 --> 22:27.650
'Cause I'm great.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.130
[scoffs]

22:33.177 --> 22:34.614
Wait here. I'll be right back.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.050
Okay.

22:47.670 --> 22:48.845
Stel?

22:50.020 --> 22:52.022
Oh, c-crap.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.372
I-I lost track of time.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.330
And you can't even
pick up your phone?

22:55.374 --> 22:56.766
I left it at Mike's.
I'm so sorry.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.856
Do you want to come in?

23:08.343 --> 23:09.823
My little brother's got

23:09.866 --> 23:11.651
a big test.

23:11.694 --> 23:12.869
My mom had to work late,

23:12.913 --> 23:14.305
and there's no one here
to help him study.

23:14.349 --> 23:17.178
If he doesn't pass,
then he'll be held back.

23:17.221 --> 23:20.921
I can't let him end up being
a failed fifth-year like me.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.924
What if I helped?

23:23.967 --> 23:25.447
Like, at The Side Step,

23:25.491 --> 23:27.536
how we came up with
those mnemonic devices.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.320
Oh, I don't want
to ruin your night.

23:29.364 --> 23:31.235
You're not. It's the opposite.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.107
I want to be with you.

23:40.375 --> 23:43.857
So, Todd pulled through,
big-time.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.859
Oh, these tickets are sick.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.948
[laughs]Let me know how it is.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.213
Wait, what?
You're-you're staying?

23:52.256 --> 23:54.607
He needs my help.
It's-it's kind of serious.

23:54.650 --> 23:57.392
I'll see you
tomorrow, okay?

23:57.436 --> 23:59.438
Yeah, sure. Okay. Yeah.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.227
All right, see you around.

24:06.270 --> 24:07.533
You have selective memory,
'cause the way I remember it...

24:07.576 --> 24:09.273
No, I don't. I... I know
exactly what happened.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.623
No, you were in the flatbed
of the truck...Are you kidding me?

24:10.666 --> 24:12.102
...with the guy who was...You sat on his EpiPen.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.321
You do remember!
He was, like,

24:13.364 --> 24:14.322
writing haikus
about coffee or something?

24:14.365 --> 24:15.541
LIAM:
Hey, Geri, Cordi.

24:15.584 --> 24:16.977
Hi.
Hey.Hey, you don't check your texts?

24:17.020 --> 24:18.152
I...

24:18.195 --> 24:19.893
[stammers]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.243
Look at this. Already a place
setting for the guest of honor.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.463
How'd you know?GERI: Oh, look at that.
Hey, did you hear about

24:24.506 --> 24:25.942
your brother's electric
day at the office?

24:25.986 --> 24:27.074
Okay, uh...
[clears throat]

24:27.117 --> 24:29.032
As a matter of fact, I did.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.034
H-How did you hear?
Did-did James tell you?

24:34.124 --> 24:35.169
I did.

24:39.652 --> 24:42.219
Cassie.
GERI:Oh...

24:42.263 --> 24:43.656
You must be Geri.Yes. Yes, hi.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.440
Abby was just telling me

24:45.484 --> 24:46.485
all about you.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.618
Cassie, hey, you, uh,

24:49.662 --> 24:51.011
you mind if we,

24:51.054 --> 24:52.316
if we, if we talked?

24:52.360 --> 24:53.535
Just-just the two of us.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.102
Alone, that way?

24:55.145 --> 24:57.321
Okay.Okay.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.587
So nice to meet you.Nice to meet you.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.981
"Nice to meet you."[softly]:
Give her a chance. Go.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.114
Hmm.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.289
What are you doing here?

25:08.332 --> 25:10.683
Well, I heard you
needed a ranch hand.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.642
Seriously? R-Ranch hand? Y-You
told my mom you're a ranch hand

25:13.686 --> 25:16.602
t-to what, to Trojan Horse
your way inside my home?

25:16.645 --> 25:17.690
Well, you said I was
a bad Ranger.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.518
I didn't say you...

25:23.696 --> 25:26.481
Wait a second.
[laughs softly]

25:26.525 --> 25:27.656
Are you here
because you actually do

25:27.700 --> 25:29.049
want to be my partner?

25:29.092 --> 25:30.180
[scoffs]
No.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.181
[phone vibrating]Why?

25:31.225 --> 25:32.618
Do you want to be mine?[scoffs]

25:34.271 --> 25:35.795
It's DPS.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.971
Techs found the tracking beacon
inside the stolen Bentley.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.494
But why would the perp
put a tracker

25:39.538 --> 25:40.582
inside a car he'd stolen?

25:40.626 --> 25:41.975
You know, it never
sat right with me

25:42.018 --> 25:43.498
that he left the car out
in the open like that,

25:43.542 --> 25:45.282
engine running, keys inside.

25:45.326 --> 25:49.199
Yeah, it's almost like he wanted
us to find it and repossess it.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.679
Trojan Horse.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.333
Do you think

25:52.376 --> 25:53.987
our perp might have stolen
the car just to...

25:54.030 --> 25:55.989
Just to put the beacon inside.

25:56.032 --> 25:57.643
So he could follow
it to the asset

25:57.686 --> 25:59.035
forfeiture warehouse.Asset forfeiture warehouse.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.646
Paititi.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.648
Like, the lost city of gold?

26:02.691 --> 26:06.695
Yeah.Wow, apt analogy.
I didn't think you knew...

26:06.739 --> 26:08.654
Okay, d-don't be surprised,
all right? I-I'm well-read.

26:08.697 --> 26:12.614
Well, our perp is probably
already on his way there, so...

26:12.658 --> 26:15.704
Yeah, we should go. Um...

26:15.748 --> 26:18.707
Hey, uh, did you want
to ride shotgun

26:18.751 --> 26:21.144
or are you partial to the trunk?

26:27.890 --> 26:31.633
Will you come back?
I mean, like another night?

26:31.677 --> 26:34.331
To help with finals or just
to watch WrestleMania?

26:34.375 --> 26:36.377
Yeah, that'd be fun.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.553
Hey, you've got this test.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.468
You know the material.

26:40.511 --> 26:41.643
How about this?

26:41.687 --> 26:44.472
You ace your test,
we go to WrestleMania.

26:44.515 --> 26:45.778
Deal.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.257
[chuckles]All right.

26:47.301 --> 26:48.607
Hey, be back in a few, big man.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.521
â™ª And you want a miracle

26:50.565 --> 26:52.523
â™ª I'll build a spaceship...

26:52.567 --> 26:54.700
Sorry I didn't text earlier.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.527
I hope no one gets
mad that I flaked.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.312
Stop apologizing.

26:58.355 --> 27:01.750
You had a good reason.
Being a good brother.

27:03.796 --> 27:08.496
You know, I've never
seen you like this before.

27:08.539 --> 27:12.195
Your house,
with your brother, all of it.

27:14.197 --> 27:18.201
Well... now that you have,

27:18.245 --> 27:20.551
â™ª You can just be yourself...

27:20.595 --> 27:23.946
I hope you don't see me
any different than before.

27:25.252 --> 27:28.385
â™ª Close your eyes...

27:29.735 --> 27:32.346
It's too late for that.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.918
â™ª It's all in your mind

27:38.961 --> 27:41.703
â™ª All of the time

27:43.313 --> 27:45.968
â™ª Let it go.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.669
â™ª

27:57.414 --> 27:59.373
CASSIE:
Geez, look at this stuff.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.723
It's a treasure trove
of asset forfeiture.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.770
RVs, nice cars, motorcycles.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.557
The state makes billions
confiscating

28:09.600 --> 28:11.428
all this and reselling it.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.430
Guy's probably already
loaded up by now.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.394
Uh, safe to say, our imposter
may go dark after this.

28:20.437 --> 28:21.961
Well, assuming
he's still in here.
Yeah.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.745
[buzzing]Hey.

â™ª I got to speak,
and you want to listen up â™ª

29:30.029 --> 29:33.293
â™ª There is no time
to feast your eyes â™ª

29:33.336 --> 29:35.904
â™ª You want it all,

[tires screeching]

29:42.519 --> 29:44.652
â™ª What is your weapon of choice?
There is no weapon â™ª

â™ª To free us all

â™ª What is your weapon of choice?
What's your weapon of choice? â™ª

29:50.614 --> 29:52.965
Walker!G-Go. Don't let him get away.

29:53.008 --> 29:54.662
Go!

29:54.705 --> 29:56.316
â™ª I won't waste it

29:56.359 --> 29:58.971
â™ª I won't waste my love
on a nation â™ª

29:59.014 --> 30:00.320
â™ª I won't waste it...

30:00.363 --> 30:02.757
Hand me the bag.
No sudden moves.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.672
The bag! Slowly.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.369
â™ª On a nation

30:12.462 --> 30:15.030
â™ª Everyone's got their own

30:15.074 --> 30:18.860
â™ª Every pawn will pay

â™ª I'll see you through

What's your weapon of choice? â™ª

â™ª There is no weapon

â™ª What is your weapon of choice?
What's your weapon of choice? â™ª

30:35.572 --> 30:36.704
Where is he?

30:36.747 --> 30:37.618
Wh-Who?

30:37.661 --> 30:38.662
Miles Vyas.

30:38.706 --> 30:39.707
What did you do to him?

30:39.750 --> 30:40.708
SUSPECT:
Nothing!

30:40.751 --> 30:42.579
[screaming]

30:42.623 --> 30:44.451
Don't lie to me.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.018
SUSPECT:
The newspapers!

30:46.061 --> 30:47.671
They all said
he was dead. I-I...

30:47.715 --> 30:49.369
I just saw an opportunity.

Cass, Cass, Cass, don't!

30:51.458 --> 30:53.068
Don't. Don't do something
you're gonna regret, Cass.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.896
Cassie!

30:54.940 --> 30:56.506
Listen to me.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.073
Cass.

30:59.161 --> 31:00.815
This isn't what Miles
would've wanted.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.817
â™ª On a nation,
I won't waste it â™ª

31:02.861 --> 31:05.515

31:21.009 --> 31:22.968
WALKER:
You know, um,

31:23.011 --> 31:25.579
it may have helped
our cause a little bit

31:25.622 --> 31:27.668
if you could carry
a sidearm again.

31:27.711 --> 31:30.149
I-I don't carry.

31:30.192 --> 31:33.456
Wh-What do you mean,
you don't, you don't carry?

31:33.500 --> 31:36.895
Six months ago, with Miles,

31:36.938 --> 31:40.768
on our last case,
we got separated.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.684
I was...

31:43.727 --> 31:45.729
jumped.

31:45.773 --> 31:48.036
And they took my weapon.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.430
Later that night,
they found

31:50.473 --> 31:52.780
two bullet casings
where Miles was last seen.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.782
No blood trail,

31:54.825 --> 31:58.568
but the thought that he might
have died at the hand of...

31:58.612 --> 32:01.571
Yeah.Yeah, it haunts me.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.704
I imagine.

32:05.706 --> 32:09.144
Hence, uh, the Taser.

32:09.188 --> 32:10.972
[chuckles]

32:12.495 --> 32:14.149
I'm not crazy.I know.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.630
No... y-you are

32:16.673 --> 32:18.588
crazy enough

32:18.632 --> 32:20.199
[chuckles]:
to hold your own.[laughs]

32:20.242 --> 32:21.983
Hey.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.029
I know what that's like.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.597
Chasing ghosts.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.209
I also know

32:30.252 --> 32:32.951
that it's best
to not do that alone.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.942
[exhales]

33:07.986 --> 33:09.074
[knocks on door]

33:09.117 --> 33:10.118
Hey.
Hey.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.859
Thanks for
coming down.

33:11.902 --> 33:13.730
You can come on in.

33:13.774 --> 33:16.124
Look, I know you weren't
officially part of the arrest,

33:16.168 --> 33:19.954
but, um, it's safe to say
you helped out,

33:19.998 --> 33:21.260
a lot more than you know.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.653
So, who was this guy?

33:23.697 --> 33:25.264
[sighs]
His name's Matt Daniels.

33:25.307 --> 33:29.964
He's just a, a drifter
passing through Dallas

33:30.008 --> 33:31.270
right around the same
time Miles disappeared.

33:31.313 --> 33:33.533
But his confession
measures up.

33:33.576 --> 33:36.057
There's no ties to the grand
theft auto crew. I'm sorry.

33:38.668 --> 33:41.628
Yeah. It is what it is.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.893
[laughs]
So why do you look like a dude

33:45.936 --> 33:47.677
who's about to tell me
something else?

33:47.721 --> 33:48.678
[chuckles]

33:48.722 --> 33:50.289
Well...

33:54.945 --> 33:58.253
Well, lookee there.
That for me?

34:00.212 --> 34:01.778
[chuckles]It's up to you.

34:04.259 --> 34:06.827
We both know you're not
gonna stop looking for Miles.

34:06.870 --> 34:07.958
I can't.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.135
I know. So, let us help you.

34:10.178 --> 34:12.093
[exhales]

34:12.137 --> 34:13.747
If you choose to wear
the badge again,

34:13.790 --> 34:14.835
you'll be under
my command.

34:14.878 --> 34:17.185
I know that we
basically just met,

34:17.229 --> 34:20.754
but your intuition, the way
you color outside the lines...

34:20.797 --> 34:22.669
I didn't know what
I was looking for

34:22.712 --> 34:26.281
in a new Ranger
until I saw it in you.

34:26.325 --> 34:29.023
You remind me...
[laughs]

34:29.067 --> 34:31.678
You remind me of my old partner.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.027
That a compliment?

34:33.071 --> 34:37.118
Listen, he's the best Ranger
that I got.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.120
And I see that potential in you.

34:39.164 --> 34:42.863
I do. If you have
the right partner.

34:42.906 --> 34:44.908
I can't make any promises,

34:44.952 --> 34:49.130
other than I will have
your back, and so will he,

34:49.174 --> 34:51.001
all the way.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.918
So, how long did you know
we were right for...?The Taser.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.312
It was the Taser.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.631
[footsteps approaching]

35:11.674 --> 35:13.067
WALKER:
Hey. Cassie.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.113
How'd it go in there?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.031
[chuckles]

35:21.075 --> 35:22.903
You know, I think

35:22.946 --> 35:24.687
mine's shinier than yours.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.820
Worn and weathered
means experience.
Ah.

35:26.863 --> 35:29.692
That what we are?
Like Yoda and Luke?

35:29.736 --> 35:34.001
Uh, I was thinking more,
you know, Crockett and Tubbs.

35:34.044 --> 35:35.916
Or, uh, Hawks Shadow?

35:35.959 --> 35:37.744
The-- Hawks Shadow?
Wh-What's Hawks Shadow?

35:37.787 --> 35:39.659
TV show? Early '90s?

35:39.702 --> 35:42.749
A martial arts master and some
guy dressed in a hawk costume?

35:42.792 --> 35:44.838
Yeah, come on. Hawks Shadow.

35:44.881 --> 35:47.971
Caw!Oh-- Don't-don't...
do that. Hawk--

35:48.015 --> 35:49.277
That-that show
never existed.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.366
Oh, yeah, I can't believe
we're partners.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.368
We'll figure out
our partner name as we go.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.849
Along with everything else.

35:55.892 --> 35:58.199
Mm. Sounds good.Sounds good.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.940
All right.

35:59.983 --> 36:02.769
See you tomorrow, partner.[chuckles]

36:02.812 --> 36:06.207
Hey, uh, last
time I saw Miles,

36:06.251 --> 36:09.906
we got into an argument
over something stupid.

36:09.950 --> 36:12.909
Yeah, you talk to
people all the time,

36:12.953 --> 36:16.348
but you really never know
when it'll be the last time.

36:16.391 --> 36:19.916
Y-You never know if you're gonna
get the chance to tell them

36:19.960 --> 36:21.918
what they really mean to you.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.226
So, did you want
to tell me something?

36:25.270 --> 36:26.923
No, you and Geri, dummy.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.230
I saw you together
last night.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.710
Don't act like you
weren't about to send her

36:30.753 --> 36:32.320
some adorable little
text just now.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.149
Okay. I-It's...
[clears throat]

36:35.193 --> 36:36.324
MAN:
Afternoon, Rangers.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.369
MAN 2:
Afternoon.

36:37.412 --> 36:38.718
It's complicated.

36:38.761 --> 36:41.851
And waiting
will do what exactly?

36:41.895 --> 36:44.724
It's always
complicated.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.421
It shouldn't make sense.

36:46.465 --> 36:49.424
But if there's
something there...

36:49.468 --> 36:52.253
deep end. Jump.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.256
Deep end.

36:56.518 --> 37:01.088
Cass, I don't know
what you wanted to tell Miles,

37:01.131 --> 37:03.351
that night, but...

37:03.395 --> 37:05.092
you can tell me anything.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.441
Anytime, always.

37:06.485 --> 37:09.314
Yeah, brutal honesty,
no secrets.

37:09.357 --> 37:10.489
No secrets.Deal.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.969
Deal.

37:13.013 --> 37:17.060
You know, we'll call that
rule number 43.

37:17.104 --> 37:19.280
Hmm.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.413
Wait, what are the other 42?

37:22.849 --> 37:24.807
[both chuckle]

37:24.851 --> 37:26.287
[truck door closes,
engine starts]

37:29.943 --> 37:31.945
[knocking on door]

37:35.209 --> 37:36.515
Gale.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.778
I-Is everything all right?

37:38.821 --> 37:40.301
No.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.434
Do you want to come in?

37:42.477 --> 37:44.305
Abby, it takes a lot
for me to come here.

37:44.349 --> 37:48.178
Well, it takes a lot for me to
invite you in, but here we are.

37:50.006 --> 37:53.053
I've been thinking a lot
about the past.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.402
About Marv.

37:57.057 --> 37:59.102
It's a topic we have avoided
for way too long.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.278
If this is about
the other day...

38:00.321 --> 38:01.322
Look, there's still
a lot I don't know

38:01.366 --> 38:04.020
about that night.

38:04.064 --> 38:09.243
But the one thing I do know is,
Marv came to see you.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.378
What'd you talk about?

38:15.336 --> 38:16.468
Let's talk.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.531
TREY:
All right.

38:36.575 --> 38:38.272
I'm all about boots
on the ground,

38:38.316 --> 38:40.492
but what are we looking
for here, Liam?

38:40.535 --> 38:42.102
The border.

38:42.145 --> 38:45.018
The real border between
our land and the Davidsons'.

38:49.109 --> 38:52.286
The boundary is in question,
to say the least.

38:52.330 --> 38:56.203
My dad's original map shows
that the property line...

38:57.422 --> 39:00.120
...ends way out there.

39:00.163 --> 39:02.035
But the county map

39:02.078 --> 39:06.082
shows that the property line
ends right where we're standing.

39:06.126 --> 39:07.388
Wait, so...

39:07.432 --> 39:09.172
this line,
right through the Walker ranch?

39:09.216 --> 39:10.391
Right here.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.437
So, which one's
the right one?

39:12.480 --> 39:15.396
I don't know yet. I mean,
that's what's in question.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.572
But someone could look at this
and come to the conclusion...

39:19.574 --> 39:21.402
...we might be living
on their land.

39:22.925 --> 39:24.144
[sighs]

39:54.130 --> 39:55.523
[engine shuts off]

40:07.230 --> 40:09.581
[knocking]

40:21.375 --> 40:22.463
Cordi.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.117
Hey.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.553
Hi.
Hi.

40:25.597 --> 40:28.208
Hi.
Uh...

40:28.251 --> 40:30.515
Hmm.

40:33.518 --> 40:38.523
Okay? Uh, there-there's
something here with-with you.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.089
Or-- and me, too.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.309
Or us. This.

40:42.352 --> 40:43.963
Wh-Whatever this is.

40:44.006 --> 40:45.312
You know, and-and--

40:45.355 --> 40:46.487
I've been thinking, you know,

40:46.531 --> 40:49.011
I've been thinking
about, like...

40:49.055 --> 40:52.145
all we've been through,
and, um, I...Hey.

40:52.188 --> 40:55.017
â™ª If I lose my sight

40:56.454 --> 40:59.457
â™ª And I fall for you...

40:59.500 --> 41:01.328
[sighs]

41:01.371 --> 41:04.200
I-I kept...

41:04.244 --> 41:08.509
thinking about... you.

41:08.553 --> 41:12.165
And how you stuck around.

41:12.208 --> 41:13.688
Uh, and...Yeah.

41:13.732 --> 41:18.214
...um, how that...
how that made me feel.

41:19.259 --> 41:20.608
Um...

41:20.652 --> 41:23.437
Well...

41:23.481 --> 41:27.354
How, how, how do you feel?

41:28.616 --> 41:30.531
I feel, um...

41:30.575 --> 41:33.665
â™ª And I'll fall for you...

41:33.708 --> 41:35.493
I feel tired.

41:35.536 --> 41:38.496
Tired of-of-of waiting.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.628
Um, I'm wondering...

â™ª When the waters rise

41:43.588 --> 41:46.373
â™ª And I'll run to you

â™ª If the bombs ignite

41:50.595 --> 41:54.207

41:57.819 --> 42:02.171
â™ª And I'll be all for you
if you lose the fight. â™ª
