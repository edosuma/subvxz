09:46.550 --> 09:48.710
What do you think?

09:48.710 --> 09:50.150
I don't think so.

09:50.150 --> 09:52.280
You're wasting your time.

09:52.280 --> 09:55.490
Nobody can untie one of my
special figure-eight rolling

09:55.490 --> 09:57.710
hitched double overhand
two and 1/2 looped knots.

PETER: Hey, Mr. Tod, up here!

10:01.010 --> 10:05.120
You're too late to save your
little friend, Peter Rabbit.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.220
You're right, she is little.

10:07.220 --> 10:09.900
Hardly going to make
much of a meal, is she?

10:09.900 --> 10:10.610
Uh, uh.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.800
Yes, I'm just a snack compared
to our friend Roly, over there.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.490
Hey, luckily Roly Poly
wasn't caught in your trap.

10:18.490 --> 10:20.180
Look at the size of him.

10:20.180 --> 10:23.880
He'd make a fine breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.470
With enough leftover
for sandwiches!

10:27.470 --> 10:32.900
Hmm, he doesn't look like
he can run away very fast.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.960
It's dinner time, Roly Poly.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.840
Err, err, gotcha.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.790
Ooh.

10:38.790 --> 10:39.750
Uh.

10:39.750 --> 10:45.250
Under, over, round, and got it!

10:45.250 --> 10:46.100
[THUMP]

10:46.100 --> 10:47.430
We-- we did it!

10:47.430 --> 10:48.400
We did it!

10:48.400 --> 10:51.330
Ho-ho, yeah, wee, yo-wee!

10:51.330 --> 10:52.310
Ha, ha, ha.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.290
Phew, that was close.

10:54.290 --> 10:55.560
Sorry, we took so long.

[GROWLING]

10:58.150 --> 10:59.160
Whoop!

10:59.160 --> 11:00.870
I'm still hungry?

11:00.870 --> 11:04.500
All right, all right, quiet
down, we're going home.

11:04.500 --> 11:09.460
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.490
Pfu, blu, uh.

11:12.490 --> 11:14.160
Rats!

11:14.160 --> 11:16.660
Outfoxed by rabbits.

11:16.660 --> 11:17.630
[THUMP]

11:17.630 --> 11:19.070
Err.

11:19.070 --> 11:20.630
Ooh.

11:20.630 --> 11:24.180
I should have stayed in bed.

11:24.180 --> 11:27.310
We won't be fooled by
a pile of radishes again.

11:27.310 --> 11:28.840
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

11:28.840 --> 11:29.540
Huh?

11:29.540 --> 11:31.280
Radishes?

11:31.280 --> 11:34.060
Huh, hmm, I'm not that hungry.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.560
