WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:03.363
Previously on "Salem"...

00:03.400 --> 00:05.288
ANGRY ANNE: Don't be a fool.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.968
You'll die out here.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.139
Soon, Little Master, soon.

00:09.170 --> 00:11.968
Then all that remains
IS to open the door

00:12.010 --> 00:14.729
and let your spirit return
to this body.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.839
MERCY:
Everything has a price, Isaac.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.700
In this case,
your life for hers.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.244
You will return the child
to Gloriana.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.019
You will restore her mind.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.982
You will return the child,
and you will restore her mind!

00:28.020 --> 00:29.521
-I cannot!
-Yes, you must!

00:29.560 --> 00:31.027
What's done is done!

00:31.060 --> 00:34.552
Calm yourself.
We may need him yet.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.749
And what of Cotton?

00:35.800 --> 00:37.597
(whooshing)

00:39.900 --> 00:41.595
Let me out!

00:42.910 --> 00:44.059
(indistinct shouting)

00:44.110 --> 00:46.328
WOMAN: Isaac!

00:46.380 --> 00:48.905
MAN: Isaac! Isaac!

00:48.940 --> 00:50.100
Our mother calls.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.072
It is time we really listen.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.610
COUNTESS MARBURG: Mary Sibley.

00:53.650 --> 00:54.947
Bring me the rest of her blood.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.412
(gasps)

01:00.460 --> 01:03.020
Now it begins.

01:03.060 --> 01:06.029
SENTINEL: The instrument
is filled with Red Mercury.

01:06.060 --> 01:08.620
When the hammer strikes,
all will blow.

01:08.660 --> 01:10.025
That means we have
a quarter of an hour

01:10.070 --> 01:11.765
for you to help me
stop this thing.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.769
Now, why on earth
would I want to do that?

01:14.800 --> 01:17.564
You would damn generations
to hell on earth

01:17.610 --> 01:19.931
because of your own
bitter heart?!

01:21.480 --> 01:23.277
(wheezing)

01:23.310 --> 01:25.403
I'm home.

01:30.020 --> 01:32.318
(wheezing)

01:32.360 --> 01:35.454
Well done, little Marburg.

01:35.490 --> 01:38.220
Your late mother
would be proud of you.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.820
Now, summon your husband.

01:40.860 --> 01:44.318
The hour is nearly here,
and with it,

01:44.370 --> 01:46.998
the moment of his glory.

01:48.170 --> 01:50.365
And mine.

01:53.110 --> 01:56.898
It's no good trying to
escape me, Mother.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.510
Even Hell will not hide you now.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.745
(door slams)

02:01.780 --> 02:04.283
In a few minutes
it will be midnight.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.950
It will be the dawn of
Black Sunday, of a new world,

02:08.990 --> 02:12.949
and most importantly,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.150
our wedding day.

02:17.830 --> 02:21.038
I guess they're right.

02:21.070 --> 02:23.538
A leopard can't
change its spots.

02:23.570 --> 02:27.506
No need to
when they look so dashing.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.701
So why come at all?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.310
Why risk your neck
and dirty your hands

02:32.350 --> 02:34.477
when the bomb
can take care of me?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.715
Excellent questions, Captain.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.047
Well, first of all,

02:38.090 --> 02:40.217
for the sheer pleasure
of killing you myself.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.627
Secondly, bring back
a little souvenir of your corpse

02:43.660 --> 02:46.128
to your Mary
for the pain she's caused me.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.025
My Mary?

02:48.060 --> 02:49.869
Yes.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.733
Yes, I admit that I failed to
dislodge you from her heart.

02:52.770 --> 02:55.796
Of course, she's made of
sterner stuff than you.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.364
I'd almost enw you,

02:57.410 --> 03:00.470
but there's no point
in enwing a dead man.

03:00.510 --> 03:01.875
(grunts)

03:08.620 --> 03:10.485
Thank you.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.308
A little external pain distracts
from the internal ache.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.558
And still, nothing will ever
taste as sweet to me as she did.

03:18.590 --> 03:21.559
Do you remember
what her nectar tastes like?

03:21.600 --> 03:24.194
I shall never forget.

03:24.230 --> 03:25.766
(grunts)

03:28.640 --> 03:30.005
No, these are my favorite,

03:30.040 --> 03:32.577
so I don't want to stain them.

03:32.610 --> 03:35.238
Besides, I want
to feel the life

03:35.280 --> 03:37.908
leaving your body
as I kill you.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.544
You have soft hands
for a job like that.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.070
Yes.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.781
My fingers strummed her

03:43.820 --> 03:46.254
in ways your crude calluses
could never.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.278
Did you enjoy watching us,
Captain?

03:52.730 --> 03:54.721
That's right.
We really were there.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.524
I hope you had enough time
to pick up a few tips

03:57.570 --> 03:59.731
about how to
really please a woman.

04:00.570 --> 04:01.969
(screams)

04:08.680 --> 04:10.102
Ouch.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.105
(sighs)

04:11.150 --> 04:13.038
I could do this forever.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.640
But time flies,
even on battered wings.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.942
(screams)

04:16.990 --> 04:18.912
Besides,
we have only a few minutes

04:18.950 --> 04:20.656
until the Red Mercury blows

04:20.690 --> 04:22.920
and destroys Salem
and all life within her.

04:38.010 --> 04:40.035
("Cupid Carries A Gun" plays)

04:45.650 --> 04:48.414
* Pound me the witch drums

04:48.450 --> 04:49.986
* Witch drums

04:50.020 --> 04:52.614
* Pound me the witch drums

04:53.890 --> 04:56.450
* Pound me the witch drums

04:56.490 --> 04:57.855
* The witch drums

04:57.890 --> 05:00.427
* Better pray for hell

05:00.460 --> 05:05.727
* Not hallelujah

05:24.050 --> 05:26.985
(indistinct shouting)

05:27.020 --> 05:28.908
(women screaming)

05:34.030 --> 05:37.295
They're shouting my name!

05:37.330 --> 05:41.994
They will tear me apart.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.634
A fitting end
for a man of the people --

05:44.670 --> 05:47.400
each shall have
a piece of you.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.237
Oh, shut up!

05:49.280 --> 05:51.669
I could kill you
in an instant.

05:51.710 --> 05:54.372
They'll burn you out,

05:54.420 --> 05:56.888
and all of Knockers Hole
with you.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.184
I ain't interested in seeing
Knockers Hole

05:59.220 --> 06:01.051
burned to the ground.

06:01.090 --> 06:02.853
Those men outside --

06:02.890 --> 06:04.881
pretty sure
they'll listen to me.

06:04.930 --> 06:09.048
All you need to do is free me
so I can speak to them.

06:12.070 --> 06:15.164
(groans)

06:15.200 --> 06:19.068
(voice breaking)
I am so close --

06:19.110 --> 06:23.444
so close to being rid
of you,

06:23.480 --> 06:27.109
to claiming a life
for myself.

06:27.150 --> 06:31.382
And you would just come in

06:31.420 --> 06:34.912
and you ruin everything!

06:34.960 --> 06:37.929
My love, please,

06:37.960 --> 06:40.599
let us live
to fight another day.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.629
Oh.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.297
Call me that again.

06:46.330 --> 06:48.389
What? My love?

06:48.440 --> 06:49.759
Yes.

06:49.810 --> 06:54.235
I will call you
my love every day,

06:54.280 --> 06:58.148
until the day I die.

06:58.180 --> 07:02.344
But I would rather
it were not today.

07:08.490 --> 07:09.582
(crying)

07:09.630 --> 07:10.983
Let him go.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.024
(clank)

07:23.810 --> 07:26.472
My love.

07:26.510 --> 07:29.308
My love.

07:29.340 --> 07:33.618
People of Knockers Hole!

07:33.650 --> 07:35.140
Fnends!

07:35.180 --> 07:36.647
Neighbors!

07:36.690 --> 07:38.681
Please, they've set me free!

07:38.720 --> 07:41.689
We've won!
There's no need for this!

07:44.030 --> 07:46.498
ANNE:
I know, dear Cotton. I know.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.861
Terrible.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.368
Awful.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.029
Evil incarnate.

07:56.070 --> 07:58.959
You've opened my eyes,
dear husband.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.807
I was the perfect wife,

08:00.840 --> 08:04.207
and yet you still preferred
the company of a whore.

08:04.250 --> 08:09.176
Well, the pain you caused me
set me free

08:09.220 --> 08:13.156
from all my slavish craving
for the world's approval.

08:13.190 --> 08:15.511
Anne...

08:15.560 --> 08:17.323
whatever your hatred
for me,

08:17.360 --> 08:21.126
do not let that be hatred
for all the people of Salem.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.323
In minutes,
they will all die.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.668
But there might yet
still be time.

08:26.700 --> 08:30.466
Please, please let me out of
here before it is too late.

08:30.510 --> 08:35.630
Oh, you may yet
save Salem, dear Cotton.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.671
You and I both know

08:37.710 --> 08:41.009
what a dissolute weakling
you really are.

08:41.050 --> 08:42.642
But when I release you,

08:42.690 --> 08:44.317
you will have
the chance to be

08:44.350 --> 08:48.389
that great man
everybody believes you to be.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.693
(panﬁng)

08:53.730 --> 08:56.358
(panﬁng)

09:01.200 --> 09:03.907
It's perfectly safe now,
Mr. Dinley.

09:05.410 --> 09:09.335
First I must choose which detail
she will find most piquant.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.975
So I may sip from the pain
in her eyes when she sees it.

09:14.650 --> 09:17.118
What do you think, Dinley?

09:17.150 --> 09:19.015
What would move her most?

09:19.050 --> 09:22.258
The eyes that she gazed into?

09:22.290 --> 09:27.023
The heart that beats for her?

09:27.060 --> 09:29.961
Or those callused hands
that she prefers to mine?

09:32.230 --> 09:35.393
(gasps)

09:35.440 --> 09:38.432
**

10:10.470 --> 10:12.938
I believe...

10:12.980 --> 10:14.402
I believe neither of us

10:14.440 --> 10:17.648
ever loved anybody but her
our whole lives.

10:20.020 --> 10:24.081
In my jealousy,
I plotted her destruction.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.352
Now, it is my only regret.

10:28.390 --> 10:32.121
I just couldn't bear
to live without her.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.698
But now I don't have to.

10:35.730 --> 10:38.324
So listen --

10:38.370 --> 10:43.137
She is in unspeakable danger.

10:43.170 --> 10:46.731
For once, prove yourself worthy
of her love.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.008
Save her.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.644
(gasps)

10:58.190 --> 11:00.249
How do we stop this?

11:01.660 --> 11:03.582
How do we stop this?!

11:11.870 --> 11:13.360
(ticking)

11:13.400 --> 11:15.288
No, you can't run --

11:15.340 --> 11:17.035
You can't run far enough
to get away from this.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.538
All right,
do you have any suggestions?

11:19.570 --> 11:21.834
Prayer.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.774
**

11:35.720 --> 11:39.087
I've been waiting
for this moment since we met.

11:39.130 --> 11:43.089
I hoped you might be the one,
the great soul I need.

11:43.130 --> 11:47.430
I am no great soul.

11:47.470 --> 11:50.405
I am just another
miserable sinner.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.601
I beg you,

11:52.640 --> 11:54.835
by the glory you once knew,

11:54.880 --> 11:56.575
by the Heaven
you once dwelled in,

11:56.610 --> 11:59.408
do not use the innocent people
of Salem as pawns

11:59.450 --> 12:01.441
in a chess game
against your father.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.188
Oh, good Mather.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.585
With every word,

12:05.620 --> 12:08.282
you prove you're indeed
everything I hoped.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.959
Any minute now,
midnight will strike.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.595
We will see a tremendous flash,

12:13.630 --> 12:16.895
feel the earth itself
pitch and roll beneath our feet,

12:16.930 --> 12:21.390
and hear the screams of_
thousands as they are vaporized.

12:24.740 --> 12:27.573
For generations,
you and your family

12:27.610 --> 12:30.443
have claimed responsibility
for the good souls of Salem.

12:30.480 --> 12:35.611
And in a moment, all that hard
work will be obliterated --

12:35.650 --> 12:37.641
not merely on your watch,

12:37.690 --> 12:40.113
but by your choice.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.310
How is any of this
my choice?

12:42.360 --> 12:45.727
I would stop all of it
at any cost!

12:45.760 --> 12:47.819
Excellent.

12:47.860 --> 12:51.159
Because you -- and you alone --
have that power.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.169
You may indeed stop
all of this

12:54.200 --> 12:56.259
with but one word.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.375
The word "yes."

13:02.640 --> 13:04.505
Yes.

13:06.050 --> 13:07.574
(ticking)

13:07.620 --> 13:09.576
DINLEY: Five minutes, Captain.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.747
I hope you know
what you're doing.

13:11.790 --> 13:16.113
Maybe if
I jam the striker somehow.

13:18.060 --> 13:21.689
Every soul has its price.
What's yours, Mather?

13:21.730 --> 13:24.619
What would you
sell your soul for?

13:24.670 --> 13:26.399
I want nothing from you.

13:31.670 --> 13:33.171
What are you asking of me?

13:34.580 --> 13:37.208
The willing sacrifice
of one great soul

13:37.250 --> 13:39.047
is far more powerful
than the slaughter

13:39.080 --> 13:41.844
of so many thousand
head of human cattle.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.646
So I set their lives
against yours.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.954
Are you asking me
to kill myself?

13:47.990 --> 13:51.050
It's not your life I want
but your soul --

13:51.090 --> 13:54.491
sinless and of free will
that you must enter.

13:54.530 --> 13:55.929
Enter?

14:00.600 --> 14:02.568
Don't worry.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.329
It won't hurt.

14:04.370 --> 14:07.203
Not at first.

14:12.110 --> 14:14.544
Consign yourself
to an eternity in Hell,

14:14.580 --> 14:17.447
and save every soul in Salem.

14:22.690 --> 14:25.523
IfI enter Hell,

14:25.560 --> 14:27.824
you will spare the world
your depredation?

14:27.860 --> 14:31.261
Oh, no, Husband,
let's not be greedy.

14:31.300 --> 14:35.566
Nothing can stop the plan
my Dark Lord has in this world.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.831
But he_would save
every life In Salem.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.668
Even the life
of your true love.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.246
What's her name?

14:43.280 --> 14:45.578
Harmonia? Desdemona?

14:45.610 --> 14:48.272
Gloriana.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.845
Don't you want to
spare that pitiful whore

14:50.890 --> 14:52.778
an agonizing death?

14:52.820 --> 14:55.812
**

15:00.330 --> 15:03.959
My father told me that there
was no time in Hell --

15:04.000 --> 15:07.094
no past, no future,

15:07.140 --> 15:13.534
only all of time
in an eternal present.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.378
And that I was already there --

15:16.410 --> 15:18.674
burning beside him.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.379
I have tormented myself
ever since,

15:24.420 --> 15:26.547
wondering what crime
I could possibly commit

15:26.590 --> 15:31.152
that would so consign myself
to Hell.

15:31.190 --> 15:35.752
I am relieved.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.918
It was no crime,

15:39.970 --> 15:43.235
but a choice.

15:43.270 --> 15:47.036
I will choose to be in Hell,
so that others may not.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.745
Goodbye, Mary.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.112
Goodbye, Cotton.

15:57.150 --> 16:00.859
And I'm sorry
for everything I did.

16:00.890 --> 16:03.029
If it weren't for me,
then none of us would be here

16:03.060 --> 16:04.425
and none of this
would have happened.

16:04.460 --> 16:05.358
Shh, Shh.

16:05.390 --> 16:09.690
I'm sorry too,

16:09.730 --> 16:11.994
for all the harsh words
I used.

16:12.030 --> 16:14.260
YouTe
sorry?l

16:14.300 --> 16:16.165
To her?!

16:16.200 --> 16:18.339
Aren't you sorry
for all you did,

16:18.370 --> 16:21.203
for all you failed to do
for me?!

16:23.580 --> 16:26.276
Indeed.

16:26.310 --> 16:30.610
I am sorry.

16:30.650 --> 16:35.053
I am truly, deeply sorry...

16:39.430 --> 16:41.921
...that I ever laid eyes
on you.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.869
That's all right, Cotton.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.666
You have thousands
and thousands of years

16:52.710 --> 16:55.838
to wish you had
honored our marriage

16:55.880 --> 16:58.747
and treated me better.

17:02.950 --> 17:04.542
I prefer this.

17:14.860 --> 17:17.192
(screaming)

17:20.070 --> 17:23.403
(indistinct shouting)

17:25.870 --> 17:29.909
(screaming)

17:42.420 --> 17:44.149
JOHN: (gasps)

17:47.600 --> 17:49.727
(screaming continues)

19:05.010 --> 19:07.672
JOHN SIBLEY:
(breathing heavily)

19:22.660 --> 19:24.457
Now, surely you did not imagine

19:24.490 --> 19:27.721
I would ask you
to marry a mere boy?

19:35.170 --> 19:39.163
Look what
a great sacrifice may bring.

19:39.210 --> 19:40.677
I would have enjoyed

19:40.710 --> 19:43.645
all that came with
the destruction of Salem.

19:43.680 --> 19:48.708
And I shall indeed still set the
entire world on fire with war.

19:48.750 --> 19:53.210
But only a sacrifice
of a truly great soul,

19:53.260 --> 19:56.309
a soul like Cotton Mather,

19:56.360 --> 20:00.057
could quicken
my own life force.

20:00.090 --> 20:05.096
And now the earth shall tremble
that I am in my full glory.

20:05.130 --> 20:09.533
Every move was expertly played,
if I do say so myself.

20:09.570 --> 20:12.437
Every piece moved
to its proper position.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.574
You refused the boy I was.

20:14.610 --> 20:17.170
What say you
to the man I've become?

20:17.210 --> 20:20.247
Boy or man,
it makes no difference.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.941
We cannot marry.

20:21.980 --> 20:24.414
Did not my Father
get His Mary

20:24.450 --> 20:27.510
with the very child
He would become?

20:27.560 --> 20:32.588
I shall simply
reverse the order of things.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.120
It is unnatural.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.856
You are my flesh.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.221
I gave birth to you.

20:39.270 --> 20:42.865
You and I
shall both be gods.

20:42.900 --> 20:47.769
And we shall birth
a race of gods and monsters.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.469
I've already birthed
one monster who would be god.

20:52.510 --> 20:54.273
That is quite enough for me.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.642
(laughs)

20:57.690 --> 21:00.318
Mary, Mary, Mary.

21:02.120 --> 21:07.080
You have already violated
every dicta of God and man

21:07.130 --> 21:08.995
10 times over.

21:09.030 --> 21:14.593
You have wonderfully overthrown
every shackle of convention.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.301
Don't stop now.

21:18.340 --> 21:22.731
Say yes
to a whole new world

21:22.780 --> 21:25.146
of freedom

21:25.180 --> 21:27.740
and feeling.

21:27.780 --> 21:32.581
What could hold you back
from becoming my bride,

21:32.620 --> 21:35.851
and the real
Queen of the Night?

21:35.890 --> 21:37.949
Revulsion.

21:37.990 --> 21:42.927
The thought of touching you
disgusts me.

21:42.960 --> 21:46.589
Is it revulsion
that makes your heart beat

21:46.630 --> 21:50.532
faster and faster
as I approach,

21:50.570 --> 21:52.936
or is it desire?

21:52.970 --> 21:56.269
Does my person
not please you?

21:56.310 --> 21:57.846
(laughs)

21:57.880 --> 21:59.438
I can see that it does.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.674
No.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.813
Come here!

22:19.500 --> 22:21.968
You shall serve
as maid of honor.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.128
Bring her to the altar --

22:25.170 --> 22:27.479
that is, to my bed.

22:27.510 --> 22:29.899
(breathes shakily)

22:37.020 --> 22:39.238
I could kill you.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.554
(laughs)

22:41.590 --> 22:43.012
No, you couldn't.

22:43.060 --> 22:44.379
Because you are
no longer a witch.

22:44.430 --> 22:47.593
You are a mere woman,
and a sick one at that.

22:47.630 --> 22:50.497
Poor, pathetic little girl.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.191
Not even woman enough

22:52.230 --> 22:54.869
to hold the interest
of a novice like Mather.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.561
He left you for a mere whore.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.103
And now, just because
you can't have what you want,

22:59.140 --> 23:01.677
the whole world should burn?

23:01.710 --> 23:04.838
You are trying to
provoke me into killing you,

23:04.880 --> 23:06.848
to spare you what is coming.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.108
I have nothing.

23:08.150 --> 23:10.618
Even John is lost to me.

23:10.650 --> 23:14.051
Spare me having to
consort with that thing.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.025
I can help you.

23:19.060 --> 23:24.896
I can make it so that you don't
have to wed or bed John Sibley,

23:24.930 --> 23:28.559
nor even suffer a single moment
of his touch.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.832
(indistinct shouting)

24:07.270 --> 24:09.670
MAN: Lead on!

24:09.710 --> 24:12.770
Follow!

24:14.780 --> 24:17.487
(panﬁng)

24:19.790 --> 24:21.758
Am I dying?

24:21.790 --> 24:23.587
No.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.359
You're not dying.

24:25.390 --> 24:27.028
Just rest,

24:27.060 --> 24:28.789
and when you next
open your eyes,

24:28.830 --> 24:32.027
you will be utterly safe
from his touch.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.994
You will feel like...

24:35.040 --> 24:38.339
well, like a new woman.

24:48.380 --> 24:51.019
(indistinct shouting)

24:51.050 --> 24:54.952
No!

24:54.990 --> 24:59.120
You're destroying
your own homes!

24:59.160 --> 25:01.549
DORCAS: Isaac!

25:01.600 --> 25:03.522
Dorcas!

25:04.330 --> 25:06.423
Isaac!

25:11.170 --> 25:12.660
MAN: Stop!

25:16.340 --> 25:17.898
I'm so sorry.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.804
This is all my fault.
-No, it ain't.

25:19.850 --> 25:23.069
You were just doing what
you always do -- saving me.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.884
But I'm gonna get you home,
and then we'll just stay there.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.081
No arguments. You hear me?

25:28.120 --> 25:29.656
(screams)

25:29.690 --> 25:31.248
(screams)

25:31.290 --> 25:34.293
**

26:14.270 --> 26:16.329
Mary.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.936
Mary, I'm here.

26:21.980 --> 26:26.041
Is it really you this time?

26:26.080 --> 26:29.447
Yes.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.311
It's me.

26:31.350 --> 26:34.456
What have they done to you?

26:34.490 --> 26:37.152
You came back.

26:37.190 --> 26:39.124
You came back for me.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.965
I had to.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.992
I couldn't stay away.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.099
But tell me --

26:50.140 --> 26:53.234
What have they done to you?

26:53.270 --> 26:55.773
I don't know.

26:55.810 --> 27:00.747
I thought it was the death of
the Essex now killing me.

27:00.780 --> 27:03.908
But I think Anne
and the Countess --

27:03.950 --> 27:05.815
They've done something
to me.

27:05.850 --> 27:08.785
I'm here now.

27:08.820 --> 27:12.426
It will be all right.

27:12.460 --> 27:15.156
I thought you were done
with me.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.294
I'll never be done
WIth you.

27:18.330 --> 27:22.767
Neven

27:22.800 --> 27:25.837
I just couldn't bear

27:25.870 --> 27:29.533
to see you with him.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.916
I love you so much
it hurts.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.780
You love me.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.709
You love me.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.684
Since the beginning.
Never anyone but you.

27:48.530 --> 27:51.124
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

27:51.170 --> 27:54.958
They've done something
to me.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.661
They won't let me go.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.008
You can make it.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.565
Just keep talking.

28:00.610 --> 28:03.704
I'm so cold.

28:15.190 --> 28:17.351
Stay awake.

28:17.390 --> 28:20.382
Stay alive for me.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.998
I'll get us out of here.

28:25.030 --> 28:28.193
Tell me again.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.367
It helps me.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.631
I love you.

28:42.150 --> 28:43.242
(growls)

28:43.280 --> 28:44.486
(screams)

28:49.490 --> 28:50.752
(gasps)

28:50.790 --> 28:52.678
COUNTESS MARBURG:
Thank you, Captain,

28:52.730 --> 28:55.449
but I can walk from here.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.853
(grunts)

28:56.900 --> 28:58.322
Hm.

29:14.450 --> 29:16.611
Hello, Mother.

29:16.650 --> 29:19.585
You're looking
exceptionally well.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.884
Your brother?

29:21.920 --> 29:24.627
I'm afraid
he didn't make it.

29:24.660 --> 29:26.719
Pity.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.991
But then again,
he was always the weak one.

29:30.030 --> 29:33.329
And it's all for
such a good cause.

29:33.370 --> 29:36.362
**

29:44.980 --> 29:47.676
Congratulations.

29:47.710 --> 29:51.817
Oh, thank you,
my daughter.

29:51.850 --> 29:56.059
And you shall have everything
in return.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.721
Mother.

30:20.050 --> 30:24.043
You look even more beautiful
than I imagined.

30:24.090 --> 30:29.778
1--

30:29.820 --> 30:31.720
I'm afraid.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.549
But you are here.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.897
I don't want to be.

30:38.930 --> 30:40.818
I tried my best to fight it.

30:40.870 --> 30:42.861
But I just can't.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.709
When you kissed me,

30:44.740 --> 30:47.664
all my world dissolved.

30:47.710 --> 30:50.372
Hurry, Mother.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.241
I've waited too long
for this.

30:52.280 --> 30:56.842
Oh, as have I, my son.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.609
As have I.

31:13.300 --> 31:16.189
**

31:48.440 --> 31:50.863
You.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.128
What did you do to Mary?

31:52.170 --> 31:54.274
Oh, that wasn't Mary.

31:54.310 --> 31:56.073
That was
the Countess Marburg.

31:56.110 --> 31:58.908
But if you stay calm,

31:58.950 --> 32:02.579
I will reunite you
with the real Mary.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.781
(both breathing heavily)

32:15.600 --> 32:17.898
Listen. They are baying
for our blood!

32:17.930 --> 32:19.795
MERCY:
My magic will protect us.

32:19.830 --> 32:21.297
When things have calmed down,

32:21.340 --> 32:23.934
I will get us both
safely out of here, I promise.

32:23.970 --> 32:28.532
ANNE: There is no safety in
Salem except that which I grant.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.849
If we're so safe,

32:31.880 --> 32:33.609
how the hell
did she get in here?

32:33.650 --> 32:36.949
Leave the talking
to those with something to say.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.311
Please!

32:38.350 --> 32:40.489
Leave him be! Leave him be!

32:40.520 --> 32:42.351
Please!

32:42.390 --> 32:43.516
He's had enough!

32:43.560 --> 32:45.152
He's had enough!

32:45.190 --> 32:46.487
You're killing him!

32:46.530 --> 32:48.953
Stop!

32:49.000 --> 32:51.992
**

33:08.480 --> 33:10.175
With a snap of my fingers,

33:10.220 --> 33:12.711
they'll be restored to
the orgy of self-destruction

33:12.750 --> 33:14.058
they're intent on.

33:14.090 --> 33:15.557
You too?

33:15.590 --> 33:17.353
A witch?

33:17.390 --> 33:19.984
And I intend
to be the last witch.

33:20.030 --> 33:21.952
TITUBA: Anne Hale.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.699
I warned Mary Sibley
about you long ago.

33:26.730 --> 33:31.633
I told her to drown you
like a kitten in a well.

33:31.670 --> 33:35.572
Well, lucky for you
she didn't.

33:35.610 --> 33:37.737
Because I bring good news.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.145
(thinking)
Oh, that wasn't Mary.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.841
And I intend to be
the last witch.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.643
And give up my kingdom
on Earth?

33:42.680 --> 33:44.682
Like it or not,
a widow you should be.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.914
I will reunite you.

33:45.950 --> 33:47.588
What the hell
is going on here?

33:47.620 --> 33:50.214
Mary is downstairs,
imprisoned.

33:50.260 --> 33:53.320
You must take her away,
as far and as fast as you can.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.918
Do not look back.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.827
Why would you help her?

33:57.860 --> 34:03.537
This is not for her.

34:03.570 --> 34:07.028
Did you know
I was in love with you

34:07.070 --> 34:10.278
all of my girlhood?

34:10.310 --> 34:13.768
And you saved my life once.

34:13.810 --> 34:17.041
So I will spare yours.

34:19.990 --> 34:22.458
Once.

34:22.490 --> 34:26.779
But if either of you ever dare
set foot in Salem again,

34:26.830 --> 34:30.027
you will wish I had killed you
tonight instead.

34:30.060 --> 34:34.759
And there is one thing
I want in return.

34:36.570 --> 34:41.371
That lovely angel-killing knife
you made.

34:41.410 --> 34:43.503
(both panting)

34:54.820 --> 35:01.589
I am done trying to help
these ungrateful wretches.

35:01.630 --> 35:08.559
I accept my natural power,
my rightful place,

35:08.600 --> 35:10.659
as should you.

35:10.700 --> 35:15.399
Isaac, you would make
a far better leader for Salem

35:15.440 --> 35:19.900
than Hathorne,
that disgusting old goat.

35:19.950 --> 35:23.579
I seen
what power does to people.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.781
Corrupted Hathorne.

35:25.820 --> 35:28.414
Damn nearly got me too.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.180
I can only imagine what
your power is gonna do to you.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.652
Take it from me,

35:33.690 --> 35:37.023
a fool knows a foolish path,

35:37.060 --> 35:39.961
and you are set upon one.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.797
Let it go!

35:41.840 --> 35:45.037
And give up my kingdom
on Earth?

35:45.070 --> 35:47.129
No.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.209
But I'd share it with you.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.275
Thank you,

35:55.320 --> 35:58.244
but I want no part of it.

36:00.490 --> 36:02.981
Oh.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.454
Too bad.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.663
(indistinct shouting)

36:11.700 --> 36:15.067
It was you who once told me
that a woman's greatest power

36:15.100 --> 36:18.638
comes as a widow.

36:18.670 --> 36:21.776
And that you yourself are
in the process of becoming one.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.317
I won't deny it.
Yes, it is true.

36:28.350 --> 36:30.147
That was my plan.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.818
But plans change.

36:31.850 --> 36:34.148
And I changed.

36:34.190 --> 36:35.987
Because of you.

36:36.020 --> 36:37.885
You believe in me.

36:41.700 --> 36:46.319
The only thing I want is
to love and be loved.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.065
(scoffs)

36:48.100 --> 36:53.367
Why do the best lack the courage
of their convictions?

36:53.410 --> 36:55.833
The last thing I want

36:55.880 --> 36:57.370
is to be a widow.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.606
Like it or not,

37:00.650 --> 37:03.346
a widow you shall be.

37:03.380 --> 37:04.916
(gasping)

37:07.050 --> 37:08.517
No! Stop it!

37:08.560 --> 37:10.448
Stop it! Stop it!

37:10.490 --> 37:12.048
Stop it!

37:12.090 --> 37:14.888
No!

37:16.630 --> 37:20.191
I've watched you
since you were a scabby girl,

37:20.230 --> 37:23.688
being walked through
this village like a dog.

37:23.740 --> 37:26.868
And even at your lowest,
you had something.

37:26.910 --> 37:30.698
You had a fierce ambition,

37:30.740 --> 37:33.300
a thirst for power.

37:33.350 --> 37:35.318
Where has that gone?

37:35.350 --> 37:37.648
Just let him go.
Please, just let him go.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.045
You can be
the Queen of the Night.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.944
You can have it all.

37:40.990 --> 37:42.651
I only want to be with him.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.112
I just want to be with him.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.151
That is very touching.

37:46.190 --> 37:48.522
Let it be so.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.669
Be with your love.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.622
(gasping)

38:15.320 --> 38:17.413
ANNE: (thinking)
My natural power.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.087
Because I bring good news.
That's too bad.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.018
The Dark Lord
will fulfill his promises?

38:21.060 --> 38:25.360
Of course,
as he always does.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.528
Yes. I will go far away.

38:28.570 --> 38:31.801
Yes.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.707
But that may not be enough.

38:34.740 --> 38:38.346
You see, there
can only be one narrative

38:38.380 --> 38:40.041
of the witch panic
in Salem.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.174
And I must control
that story.

38:43.220 --> 38:45.279
No one will ever hear
from me.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.514
No.

38:46.550 --> 38:49.155
But like every
great enterprise,

38:49.190 --> 38:52.023
I need a little insurance.

38:52.060 --> 38:54.949
That's the thing
about being a Seer,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.888
is you can't change
what you see.

38:56.930 --> 38:59.797
It's tragic, really.

38:59.830 --> 39:02.890
Because you are right.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.408
The world to come
will be founded

39:05.440 --> 39:10.434
on the blood, sweat, and bones
of people like you.

39:40.310 --> 39:43.074
(screams)

39:44.810 --> 39:46.641
(both scream)

39:52.290 --> 39:59.423
Why, after all you've done
to secure my victory?

39:59.460 --> 40:02.918
Power.

40:02.960 --> 40:07.863
I've discovered mine.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.731
But don't worry.

40:09.770 --> 40:13.035
I'll bring you back.

40:13.070 --> 40:17.200
But I will be
your immortal bride, not Mary.

40:17.240 --> 40:20.539
I already carry the child
you will make your new home.

40:20.580 --> 40:25.483
And mine was an immaculate
conception, as It should be.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.159
Yes.

40:33.190 --> 40:36.728
I can taste your destiny.

40:36.760 --> 40:41.163
How did I not see it?

40:41.200 --> 40:43.464
You are indeed the one.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.661
You will bring me back.

40:45.710 --> 40:49.578
And who knows,

40:49.610 --> 40:53.239
maybe this time,

40:53.280 --> 40:55.976
with you,

40:56.020 --> 40:59.046
I shall have
a happy childhood.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.381
MARY: John!

41:10.860 --> 41:13.192
John!

41:13.230 --> 41:16.233
**

41:21.810 --> 41:23.903
(gasps)

41:34.920 --> 41:37.650
(gasps)

41:39.030 --> 41:41.999
Get away.

41:42.030 --> 41:43.452
No.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.821
No. No.

41:45.870 --> 41:48.395
I waited eternities for you.

41:48.430 --> 41:52.230
Waded through centuries of blood
and for what?

41:52.270 --> 41:56.070
To lose you now?

41:56.110 --> 42:01.912
With eons of evil and ecstasy
spread before us

42:01.950 --> 42:04.077
and oceans of blood
to bathe in

42:04.120 --> 42:07.248
and a world at our feet
for the taking.

42:10.460 --> 42:12.781
What have you done?

42:15.360 --> 42:20.161
You stupid, stupid child.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.668
I should have drowned you
in my womb

42:22.700 --> 42:26.136
or strangled you
on my breast or --

42:31.880 --> 42:34.246
Forgive me.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.441
I was in shock.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.244
Now I understand.

42:39.290 --> 42:43.511
I always knew
you were my special one.

42:43.560 --> 42:46.051
Whilst it is indeed

42:46.090 --> 42:50.026
a bitter thing to have
victory snatched from me,

42:50.060 --> 42:52.722
I am proud of you.

42:52.770 --> 42:57.059
You are a true Marburg.

42:57.100 --> 43:00.263
I will happily accept
my new role,

43:07.080 --> 43:09.344
Thank you, Mother.

43:10.680 --> 43:15.310
But I've already learned
everything I need to from you.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.578
(both scream)

43:23.300 --> 43:25.495
What was it you told me?

43:25.530 --> 43:29.261
We all murder our parents.

43:29.300 --> 43:32.303
**

43:44.620 --> 43:46.679
(whooshing)

43:46.720 --> 43:48.950
(whooshing continues)

44:08.170 --> 44:10.331
Mary.

44:10.380 --> 44:13.372
**

44:26.890 --> 44:29.529
How did we
come to be here?

44:29.560 --> 44:32.120
How is this possible?
-I don't know.

44:32.170 --> 44:35.662
I don't know.

44:35.700 --> 44:38.396
But I know
Anne Hale is responsible.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.364
I don't know whether
to kill her or kiss her.

44:43.610 --> 44:47.273
Well, she's not here
right now, so...

44:58.360 --> 45:02.558
Do you remember what
I told you all those years ago?

45:02.600 --> 45:04.989
That vow I made?

45:05.030 --> 45:07.590
You said
you'd come back for me.

45:09.900 --> 45:12.562
I told you.

45:12.610 --> 45:14.874
You said
you'd be back in a year.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.201
I see your point.

45:20.250 --> 45:23.845
Some things
are worth waiting for.

45:23.880 --> 45:26.883
**

45:57.420 --> 45:59.581
(quiet murmuring)

46:05.130 --> 46:07.553
You all know me.

46:07.590 --> 46:12.892
As you knew my father
and know my husband.

46:12.930 --> 46:17.435
And I know what they would say
if they were here.

46:17.470 --> 46:20.405
These terrible pains we feel

46:20.440 --> 46:26.242
are but the birth pangs
of our brave new world.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.669
I shall know something about
birth pangs myself

46:28.710 --> 46:30.075
before too long.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.269
(congregation chuckles)

46:31.320 --> 46:33.447
And I shall endure them.

46:33.490 --> 46:38.450
By knowing that
every contraction of agony

46:38.490 --> 46:40.924
bring me one step closer

46:40.960 --> 46:44.964
to seeing my Hope
appear before my eyes.

46:47.630 --> 46:50.463
Just as each
of our terrible trials

46:50.500 --> 46:54.937
brings us one step closer
to our new Salem.

46:54.980 --> 46:58.871
And I tell you now
with total certainty --

46:58.910 --> 47:01.447
we will not only survive all,

47:01.480 --> 47:03.812
we will prosper and grow

47:03.850 --> 47:07.149
until Salem is the richest city
in this nation,

47:07.190 --> 47:10.648
with an influence
that spans the globe.

47:10.690 --> 47:14.057
But I am not just here

47:14.090 --> 47:17.196
to remind us of
the glories to come.

47:19.530 --> 47:21.828
But to warn you all

47:21.870 --> 47:26.432
of what I now know
to be the awful truth.

47:27.940 --> 47:33.708
We have been ruled by witches
all along.

47:33.750 --> 47:36.548
And not, as we thought,
from the outside,

47:36.580 --> 47:39.310
but in the very worst way --

47:39.350 --> 47:42.854
from within.

47:42.890 --> 47:47.179
Witches ruled Salem
from the very top.

47:47.230 --> 47:49.892
Names like Sibley and Marburg

47:49.930 --> 47:53.593
turned out to be masks
for the most notorious witches.

47:53.630 --> 47:55.598
Witches who very nearly
succeeded

47:55.640 --> 47:58.905
in turning Salem
into Hell on earth

47:58.940 --> 48:01.500
and handing
our entire new country

48:01.540 --> 48:04.509
over to the Devil himself.

48:04.540 --> 48:06.770
But I promise you,
I promise you now,

48:06.810 --> 48:08.675
we will do whatever is necessary

48:08.710 --> 48:13.044
to cleanse our town of every
last of Satan's whores

48:13.090 --> 48:19.029
_ and make_ sure that Sa_lem
IS never again ruled by wrtches.

48:19.060 --> 48:21.119
(cheers and applause)

48:42.750 --> 48:48.848
(screaming, cackling, crying)

48:54.430 --> 48:58.526
(thunder crashes)

49:11.610 --> 49:17.549
(people screaming)

49:35.570 --> 49:39.131
(screaming continues)
