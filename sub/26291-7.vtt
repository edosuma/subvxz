Straight line.

That's my thing.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.349
Is that a thing?How about a gallon of
water and some sleep?

00:45.393 --> 00:46.698
Wait, sleep?

Yeah, it's just, it's more
complicated than that.

01:39.577 --> 01:42.189
Yeah, I don't know how long
I'm gonna be in D.C.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.147
Yeah, when I can, I will.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.062
Look, it's just too early
for this fight, okay?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.064
I'm at work. I got to go.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.544
Hey, everything okay?

01:49.587 --> 01:51.807
Apparently not.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.417
Oh. I'd say it was

01:53.461 --> 01:55.376
a good morning, but 7:00 a.m.'s

01:55.419 --> 01:58.030
too early to deal
with this kind of tragedy.Yeah, we

01:58.074 --> 02:00.163
would have been on the scene
sooner, but the bomb squad

02:00.207 --> 02:02.383
needed more time to do
a full sweep of the area.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.949
I'm grateful for that,
considering the condition

02:03.993 --> 02:05.342
of our two victims.Yeah.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.344
Uh, driver was a Paul Franka,

02:07.388 --> 02:09.303
and the bystander was
Seaman Kyle Jones.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.434
WADE:
I haven't ascertained

02:10.478 --> 02:13.350
who's who yet.Shrapnel cause of death?

02:13.394 --> 02:15.309
Shrapnel may have caused
the condition of the bodies,

02:15.352 --> 02:16.527
but they were so close,

02:16.571 --> 02:18.181
the shockwave likely
liquefied their insides.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.183
Instantly killing
them, yes.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.445
What do we know
about the devices?

02:21.489 --> 02:22.968
Well, I'm about to try to get

02:23.012 --> 02:24.187
a chemical signature,
but considering

02:24.231 --> 02:25.362
the blast radius...

02:25.406 --> 02:26.320
GREGORIO:
Probably high explosives.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.191
TNT. Maybe RDX.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.193
HANNAH:
Yeah, I'm seeing, uh,

02:30.237 --> 02:32.500
scrap metal, bolts, nails.

02:32.543 --> 02:33.805
Was a homemade device?

02:33.849 --> 02:35.590
Courtesy of your local
hardware shop, yeah.

02:35.633 --> 02:38.723
But we did manage to find this.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.030
Remote detonator?

02:41.073 --> 02:42.901
Actually, it's a timer.So it was supposed
to go off

02:42.945 --> 02:44.425
in the French Quarter
at 2:00 in the morning?

02:44.468 --> 02:46.122
No, the bomb squad says
that the blasting cap

02:46.166 --> 02:48.559
jammed and malfunctioned
when the cars crashed.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.170
The timer failed.

02:50.213 --> 02:53.695
It suggests our sailor died
by accident.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.176
So, then, where was the bomb
supposed to go off?

02:56.219 --> 02:59.048
And was Paul Franka the
target or the suspect?

03:01.093 --> 03:03.705
Paul Franka was
a graduate student in sociology

03:03.748 --> 03:05.533
at Baronne University.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.535
Worked nights at the library
and coached intramural soccer.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.711
Personal life?According to his parents,

03:09.754 --> 03:11.321
he was well liked,
had lots of friends.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.497
Even hosted game night
at his place on Mondays.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.020
Doesn't fit the profile

03:15.064 --> 03:16.674
of a bombing suspect.He did break up

03:16.718 --> 03:18.633
with his girlfriend
here recently, but...

03:18.676 --> 03:20.896
that's about as much drama
as he ever had.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.419
Till this morning, of course.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.116
HANNAH:
Well, if the Southeast SAC

03:24.160 --> 03:25.814
is here, I'm guessing D.C.'s

03:25.857 --> 03:28.469
treating this as terrorism?Not yet. But a
massive explosion

03:28.512 --> 03:31.080
in the French Quarter did pique
their interest, and mine.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.734
Any chatter that
might give us a hint

03:32.777 --> 03:35.650
as to where this bomb
was supposed to go off?FBI and ATF

03:35.693 --> 03:37.608
are coordinating an intel sweep,

03:37.652 --> 03:39.567
focusing on Paul Franka

03:39.610 --> 03:41.351
to begin with.
Well, Franka's
been out of town

03:41.395 --> 03:43.440
the past few days
visiting family.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.268
Device could have been planted
without his knowledge.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.574
Nice "welcome home" present.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.271
PATTON: Personally, I
prefer a handshake.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.405
You know, I scoured
Franka's social media.

03:51.448 --> 03:54.538
Turns out he's not
as squeaky clean as he looks.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.279
He's a member
of something called the S.A.O.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.933
Students Against Oppression.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.370
It's a protest group
out of the university.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.198
PATTON: That's right. They
sneak into government events

04:02.242 --> 04:04.156
and corporate gatherings,
and they stage

04:04.200 --> 04:06.768
elaborate demonstrations
to disrupt and create chaos.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.291
More nuanced
than that.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.641
S.A.O. tries to
shine a light on...

04:10.685 --> 04:13.731
government overreach,
corporate hypocrisy.

04:13.775 --> 04:14.993
Hmm. You know them?

04:15.037 --> 04:16.734
Bernadine Caldwell,

04:16.778 --> 04:18.432
the professor who founded
the group, is an old friend.

04:18.475 --> 04:19.433
Social justice is

04:19.476 --> 04:20.825
her bread and butter.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.087
Doesn't seem
like social justice.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.393
Seems like mayhem.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.829
I don't endorse
their methods,

04:24.873 --> 04:26.614
but they're not violent.HANNAH:
Well, maybe not,

04:26.657 --> 04:28.877
but one of their members
blew up this morning.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.879
It might be worth
asking the group about.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.620
Mind if I talk to 'em?

04:32.663 --> 04:33.969
Bernadine...

04:34.012 --> 04:37.059
she can get a little cagey
around cops.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.627
Always knew the feds would try

04:39.670 --> 04:40.889
to find an excuse
to take us down.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.412
OTHERS:
Yeah.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.109
I'm not trying to
take anyone down.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.416
Found out
we were demonstrating

04:46.460 --> 04:47.548
at the pharmaceutical conference

04:47.591 --> 04:48.679
in town today, right?

04:48.723 --> 04:51.508
Bought and paid for,

04:51.552 --> 04:52.770
thanks to corporate America.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.032
Yeah!

04:54.076 --> 04:55.033
PRIDE:
O-Okay,

04:55.077 --> 04:56.687
o-okay, settle down.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.298
You want to help me out here?

04:58.341 --> 04:59.995
I spent my career teaching
the First Amendment, Dwayne.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.431
I love to see it in action.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.174
I'm not here about
your protest.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.698
I'm here about Paul Franka.WOMAN:
Picking away at us

05:07.742 --> 05:09.178
one by one?

05:09.221 --> 05:11.485
We won't help you harass him.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.617
Well, you don't need to.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.880
'Cause he died this morning.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.229
WOMAN:
What?

05:19.536 --> 05:21.321
The explosion?

05:21.364 --> 05:22.452
Yeah.

05:22.496 --> 05:23.888
Okay, Dwayne,

05:23.932 --> 05:26.891
no matter what is said
about S.A.O.,

05:26.935 --> 05:30.895
we are rational, not radical.

05:30.939 --> 05:34.029
No one here would have the
slightest interest in violence.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.424
No one here?

05:38.816 --> 05:40.905
Bernadine,
this isn't

05:40.949 --> 05:42.777
about protecting
the First Amendment.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.432
Two people are dead,

05:45.475 --> 05:46.607
including your student.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.961
Yasmin Hendricks.

05:53.962 --> 05:56.356
Member of your group?

05:56.399 --> 05:58.401
MAN:
Formermember.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.058
WOMAN:
And...

06:03.101 --> 06:04.625
Paul's ex-girlfriend.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.630
All right, so,
what happened?

06:09.673 --> 06:11.806
Yasmin's philosophy

06:11.849 --> 06:13.285
didn't match ours.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.331
Group voted her out.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.072
Her philosophy being...?There it is.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.378
Muslim woman,

06:18.421 --> 06:20.554
so clearly she's radicalized?

06:20.597 --> 06:23.644
Look, this is the first
I'm hearing anything

06:23.687 --> 06:24.949
about Yasmin.
I'm not jumping

06:24.993 --> 06:26.473
to conclusions.Of course

06:26.516 --> 06:27.735
you're not, Dwayne,
but understand

06:27.778 --> 06:29.824
this is sensitive.Sure.

06:29.867 --> 06:33.044
But I still need to know
everything you do about Yasmin.

06:33.088 --> 06:36.352
Starting with where she lives.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.875
SEBASTIAN:
If we hadn't already searched

06:37.919 --> 06:39.616
Yasmin's apartment, I'd guess
that she lived in her car.

06:39.660 --> 06:40.922
You remember
college life.

06:40.965 --> 06:43.751
Maintenance was
a low priority.

06:43.794 --> 06:44.839
Not for me--

06:44.882 --> 06:46.971
I was going through
an OCD phase.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.105
I was going through
a moreOCD phase.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.716
There's nothing in this car.
Check the trunk.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.110
Hey, what do you know about
Hannah's personal life?

06:55.153 --> 06:57.547
About as much as I know
about Yasmin's-- nothing.

06:57.591 --> 06:58.940
Overheard
a phone call.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.072
I think she's got an ex;
pretty sure he lives here.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.248
Okay, cool.Whoever she was talking to,
she lied

07:03.292 --> 07:04.989
about living in New Orleans.You know what I think?

07:05.033 --> 07:06.077
Hmm?Why don't we save

07:06.121 --> 07:07.644
the profiling for Yasmin,

07:07.688 --> 07:09.603
and we just give
our boss her space.

07:09.646 --> 07:12.388
That's no fun.Okay, fine.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.650
Help me with the spare.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.478
Okay.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.306
Look at this.
We got... we got wire,

07:17.349 --> 07:18.307
crimping tools...

07:18.350 --> 07:19.700
Empty cell phone boxes.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.615
Okay, I'm gonna run a chem test. Fiveempty

07:21.658 --> 07:23.181
cell phone boxes
and plenty of wire.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.879
Yeah, and this trunk
is giving off

07:24.922 --> 07:26.184
the same signature as the bomb.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.230
Means there could be
more devices.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.188
YASMIN:
Four more, to be exact.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.755
Federal agents.
Get on the ground.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.802
I don't think so.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.891
Get down now.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.197
Seriously.
Shoot me or arrest me.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.373
I'm not ruining this outfit.

07:55.866 --> 07:58.478
We got the possibility
of four explosive devices

07:58.521 --> 07:59.740
in New Orleans, and
they could go off

07:59.783 --> 08:01.959
at any time.Yeah, chemical signature
confirms

08:02.003 --> 08:04.527
TNT, probably enough
to kill dozens, maybe more.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.617
And only one person can tell us
where the devices are

08:07.661 --> 08:09.750
and when they'll go off.Yasmin Hendricks.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.403
SEBASTIAN:
She had the bomb-making
materials in her car,

08:11.447 --> 08:12.404
but it was almost like she was

08:12.448 --> 08:14.406
expecting us
when we grabbed her.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.626
Two people are already dead,
including her ex-boyfriend.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.410
I'm doing
a background search now.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.412
Have a detailed report
within the hour.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.762
We don't have
time to wait.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.546
NOPD, ATF, and FBI

08:23.590 --> 08:25.592
have bomb squads combing
the city, but...

08:25.635 --> 08:27.550
every second that passes
could mean catastrophe.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.813
I've got what's left
of the first device
in my office.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.380
I'll see if I can't get
any more evidence.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.556
We got to get Yasmin
to talk, and fast.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.166
Obviously, you've got
the most experience

08:35.210 --> 08:36.428
with interrogation, Hannah,

08:36.472 --> 08:38.169
so whatever you need.I need to find

08:38.213 --> 08:39.954
pressure points
and press them hard.
I need information

08:39.997 --> 08:41.608
as quickly as it comes in.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.653
Okay, well, we're
way ahead of you there.

08:43.697 --> 08:46.395
We will watch from
observation and feed you

08:46.438 --> 08:48.440
what we can, when we can.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.704
This girl's ice cold.
It's not gonna be
an easy interview.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.314
They all start hard,
but I break 'em all

08:52.357 --> 08:53.489
the same way.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.708
What way is that?

08:54.751 --> 08:56.579
Let them do the work.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.760
Hey there. I'm Hannah.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.936
Sorry to keep you waiting.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.591
You all right?

09:08.635 --> 09:10.724
Want to take
those heels off?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.378
Hurts my feet
just looking at 'em.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.424
I need to know the time.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.687
Time to answer
some questions, hmm?

09:17.731 --> 09:20.560
First your name, date of birth,
city you were born in.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.562
Yasmin Hendricks.
February 10, 1999.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.737
Dover, Delaware.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.174
Why don't I take
those cuffs off, huh?

09:26.217 --> 09:28.219
You're not going anywhere.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.312
Why don't you tell me

09:34.356 --> 09:37.925
in as much detail
as you can...

09:37.968 --> 09:40.710
about your dream house?

09:40.754 --> 09:42.973
My...?Dream house, yeah.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.932
Everyone's got one.

09:44.975 --> 09:48.022
I'm not sure we have
time for the "get to
know you" questions.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.328
She's establishing
a baseline.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.330
Wants to see the difference
between answering

09:52.374 --> 09:55.116
a question about facts
and make-believe.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.118
Like a human lie detector test.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.685
YASMIN:
Craftsman style.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.339
But with bigger rooms.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.646
Filled with
sun and books.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.475
Far away from other people.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.259
Even people like Paul Franka?

10:08.303 --> 10:10.479
I know you two broke up,
but you must have

10:10.522 --> 10:12.916
some feelings about his death.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.050
He broke up with me in his car
while he was getting gas.

10:16.093 --> 10:17.921
Which I paid for.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.923
The world's better off.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.186
Is that why I'm here?

10:22.230 --> 10:23.797
To mourn him?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.625
Yasmin, you know
why you're here.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.802
You're connected to the bomb
that killed Paul and a sailor.

10:28.845 --> 10:33.676
And you as much as admitted that
there's four more just like it.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.983
Maybe it hasn't
kicked in yet...

10:39.029 --> 10:41.771
...the reality
of killing someone?

10:41.815 --> 10:44.731
You tell me.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.994
You work for a government
that colonizes other cultures

10:47.037 --> 10:49.692
using bombs,
bullets, and blood.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.042
HANNAH:
I don't see it that way.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.479
YASMIN: Proud of the blood
on your hands?

10:54.523 --> 10:58.701
People in the service see
themselves as sheepdogs.

10:58.745 --> 11:03.314
Friendly, peaceful, loyal.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.929
That is, until someone
threatens our flock.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.714
Then we go
to whatever means necessary

11:11.758 --> 11:13.542
to neutralize that threat.

11:13.585 --> 11:17.589
So you're a dog?

11:21.724 --> 11:24.118
Paul Franka used to be
one of your flock.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.731
This morning

11:28.775 --> 11:30.777
his body was
ripped apart.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.043
How does that make
you feel, Yasmin?

11:38.436 --> 11:41.788
It's in my blood to put
my beliefs to the test.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.791
My father was a freedom fighter
and a martyr.

11:44.834 --> 11:48.838
He gave up everything, even me,

11:48.882 --> 11:51.188
to carry on
the struggle.

11:51.232 --> 11:54.365
You see yourself as a pet?

11:54.409 --> 11:57.760
Well, my father was
a lion of God.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.025
You want some tea?

12:03.810 --> 12:06.334
I'm gonna make you some tea.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.038
That was impressive.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.475
Thanks, but I am flying
by the seat of my pants.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.129
Usually, I have a full workup

12:19.173 --> 12:21.784
before I run an approach on
a subject. We got nothing.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.917
Yeah, but you got her
talking. Why did you leave
when she was on a roll?

12:23.960 --> 12:26.049
She straightened her
clothes when I asked
her about her father.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.311
It's a tell.Yeah.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.486
Just like
the clothes themselves.

12:28.530 --> 12:29.879
Mm-hmm.Her suit costs more

12:29.923 --> 12:31.751
than her car.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.796
She came in armor, like she knew

12:33.840 --> 12:35.929
she was gonna be arrested.
She's putting on a show.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.758
Until I have a full background,
I can't play the game.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.760
I bluff, I lose, she shuts down.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.849
Well, lucky for you,
Lasalle put together

12:42.892 --> 12:45.547
Yasmin's family history.
I might have a lead, too.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.767
Got partial prints on
the pieces of the bomb
that survived the explosion.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.681
I've got them in a tent
with vaporizing glue right now.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.901
May have Yasmin dead to rights.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.121
Well, it doesn't stop the other
devices from going off.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.384
We need as much leverage on her
as we can get.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.214
I'm gonna go back,
speak to Bernadine one-on-one.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.476
Maybe she can help.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.870
GREGORIO:
I thought my parents

13:03.913 --> 13:05.872
screwed me up.
This girl is next level.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.396
What kind of father would
radicalize his own daughter?

13:08.439 --> 13:10.920
I'm not sure
that he did.

13:16.665 --> 13:19.450
I thought there would be tea.

13:19.494 --> 13:20.974
Yeah, it's steeping.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.933
You really should
show me more respect.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.848
Humiliation leads
to escalation.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.850
Where did you read that?

13:27.894 --> 13:30.287
My father taught it to me.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.420
My father taught me what to do
when I was happy and I knew it.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.423
Why'd Dad leave you?

13:35.466 --> 13:38.992
He was a martyr and a hero.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.037
He had to make sacrifices.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.865
But you were the most important
thing in his life.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.388
His only child.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.826
We will finally know peace

13:46.869 --> 13:50.046
when we are no longer
a collection of states

13:50.090 --> 13:52.832
but one world all united
under the rules of Allah.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.400
Ashadu an la ilaha illa
illa-ilah,

13:56.444 --> 13:59.012
wa ashadu anna muhammadan
rasul ullah.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.014
The Shahada.
Hmm.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.319
You're Muslim.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.060
But your father is not.

14:04.104 --> 14:08.412
He's Unitarian. He's not
a martyr for the cause at all.

14:08.456 --> 14:11.067
He's a chemist
in suburban Cleveland.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.852
Anything you learned
about Islam

14:12.895 --> 14:15.289
you learned from your mother
or the Internet,

14:15.332 --> 14:17.595
'cause Dad left
before you were two.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.597
Mom owns a retail store
in West Texas,

14:19.641 --> 14:21.730
and considering that she's
eating-- what is that--

14:21.773 --> 14:24.602
pork ribs and rocking a
bedazzled shirt without a hijab,

14:24.646 --> 14:29.085
I'm guessing that she didn't
teach you about Qutb.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.913
Well, then.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.916
I guess you know everything
there is to know about me.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.746
Now will you tell me the time?

14:37.789 --> 14:39.226
There's enough time
to stop all of this.

14:39.269 --> 14:42.098
Where are the devices, hmm?
How long do we have?

14:42.142 --> 14:46.015
Who knows for sure?

14:46.059 --> 14:49.018
Could be two hours,
could be two minutes.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.847
I understand.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.240
You want to invent
a better father

14:53.283 --> 14:54.589
than the one
that gave you up.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.243
It is really hard
when a parent

14:56.286 --> 14:59.028
withholds love. It's even harder
when they both do.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.682
They sent you
to boarding school

15:00.725 --> 15:02.553
in New Hampshire
when you were 12 years old.

15:02.597 --> 15:03.946
Our house burned down.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.905
Mom moved in with relatives,

15:05.948 --> 15:07.689
and there wasn't much room.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.691
Yeah, but New Hampshire's
really far from West Texas.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.562
I'm guessing there were
closer schools.

15:11.606 --> 15:14.304
I could take care of myself.Oh, I don't
doubt it, Yasmin,

15:14.348 --> 15:16.045
but let's be real:
rejection is a trigger for you.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.091
It's not ideals.
You don't give a crap

15:18.134 --> 15:20.963
about the struggle.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.269
You want acceptance.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.142
I don't need anyone.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.666
I'm guessing you didn't
find your people

15:28.710 --> 15:30.451
at boarding school, huh?

15:30.494 --> 15:33.367
It's hard to be alone.
I get it.

15:33.410 --> 15:38.024
Then you went to college...
and found the S.A.O.

15:40.635 --> 15:43.943
And then there was
Professor Caldwell.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.124
Let's talk about her.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.126
BERNADINE:
Kids come to college

15:53.169 --> 15:55.084
to figure out who they are.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.130
A lot think I'm the key
to their reinvention.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.609
That was Yasmin?

15:58.653 --> 16:01.699
One of the many who
think I have the answers.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.005
She joined S.A.O.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.225
But we didn't have
too much contact.

16:07.053 --> 16:11.013
Bernadine, when we worked
relief after Katrina,

16:11.057 --> 16:13.015
we spent a lot of time together.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.277
Hard times, Dwayne.

16:14.321 --> 16:17.889
Got to know each other
pretty well.

16:17.933 --> 16:21.284
You only ever reach for that
inhaler when you're stressed.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.071
One of my students is dead.

16:25.114 --> 16:28.900
Probably killed by another of my
students, so yeah, I'm stressed.

16:28.944 --> 16:31.425
A lot more people could die.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.080
Unless you're honest with me.

16:34.123 --> 16:38.084
I could tell Yasmin was wounded.

16:38.127 --> 16:43.480
There was a darkness in her
that I recognized,

16:43.524 --> 16:45.743
and I thought I could help her.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.702
YASMIN: She pretended
like she knew me.

16:47.745 --> 16:52.054
So kind, so interested.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.883
She cooked me dinner
at her house.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.277
Gave me books to read.

16:57.320 --> 17:02.021
Said she wanted to be my mentor.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.155
I believed her.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.070
BERNADINE:
I brought her into the group.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.072
Thought working for
a brighter future

17:10.116 --> 17:11.508
would lighten her darkness.

17:11.552 --> 17:12.857
Give her purpose.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.381
Well, I was wrong.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.078
She didn't want to be
a part of something?

17:16.122 --> 17:18.602
Oh, she wanted to
possess it completely.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.214
I'm gonna need you
to be explicit.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.780
We're a protest
group, all right?

17:22.824 --> 17:25.044
We shine a light on the
injustice of the system.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.046
She had a different agenda.
A more aggressive agenda.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.525
She wanted to burn
the system down.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.310
She said that to you?Yeah, she said it.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.007
She wrote it.
I saved her e-mails.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.617
I need to see those.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.184
Yeah.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.186
HANNAH:
It must have felt amazing,

17:37.230 --> 17:38.666
to be alone all your life

17:38.709 --> 17:40.798
and then suddenly be a part
of something bigger.

17:40.842 --> 17:46.065
I was always destined
to be something bigger.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.328
Bernadine just helped me
see what it was.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.112
Yeah, she gave you a cause.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.375
A system of beliefs,
a social group.

17:52.419 --> 17:55.422
Then she suddenly took it away.

17:55.465 --> 17:58.164
Just like that. No more group.

17:58.207 --> 18:01.341
No more boyfriend,
no more Bernadine.

18:02.385 --> 18:05.214
I couldn't say.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.217
Someone finally looked at you,

18:08.261 --> 18:12.482
really saw you,
and hated what you were.

18:12.526 --> 18:17.139
Bernadine couldn't handle
what I am.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.359
She thought
that she could use me.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.143
They all did.Use you how?

18:21.187 --> 18:22.971
In what way?

18:23.014 --> 18:25.191
Did it have something to do
with the explosive devices?

18:28.281 --> 18:30.370
I could really use that tea.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.027
My associate's bringing it
right now.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.901
How's it going in there?

18:39.944 --> 18:42.686
Hannah's established a rapport,
but Yasmin keeps shutting down.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.340
You're making tea?

18:44.384 --> 18:45.950
Yeah, it's what Hannah wants.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.300
Not quite following
her strategy yet.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.953
The time pressure's
hurting the process.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.390
SEBASTIAN:
I got something.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.261
Hit on the fingerprint
from the bomb shrapnel.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.176
Who does it belong to,
Sebastian?

18:54.220 --> 18:56.439
A fugitive wanted for a bombing
in Seattle 20 years ago.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.311
Some protest over the W.T.O.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.182
Yasmin was an infant then.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.662
I remember reading
about this.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.012
Suspect was a member of
a radical environmental group.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.101
Yeah, well, the pipe bomb
she set killed two people,

19:06.145 --> 19:07.407
wounded six others.FBI's been after her

19:07.450 --> 19:09.496
for years,
but then she just disappeared,

19:09.539 --> 19:11.193
never heard from her again.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.195
Until today.
You get a positive I.D.?

19:13.239 --> 19:14.370
Uh, no other hits
off the fingerprints,

19:14.414 --> 19:16.285
but I was able
to clarify the photo.

19:18.896 --> 19:21.029
That's Bernadine Caldwell.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.639
I'll alert King now.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.206
BERNADINE:
I don't understand.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.252
I had a whole file
of Yasmin's e-mails.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.818
They got to be here somewhere.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.256
I'm usually very organized.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.083
Maybe I archived them.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.607
I'm sorry, Dwayne.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.264
Take your time.

19:42.268 --> 19:45.053
Maybe, while you're at it,

19:45.096 --> 19:48.317
we can have a more candid
conversation about your past.

19:48.361 --> 19:52.147
BERNADINE:
I really am very sorry, Dwayne.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.018
But I'm gonna need you
to get on your knees.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.816
Bernadine,

20:08.859 --> 20:11.079
what are you doing?I mean it, Dwayne.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.907
Get on your knees
or I will hurt you.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.778
Like the two people in Seattle?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.258
That was an accident.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.520
I was trying to destroy
a chemical truck.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.174
I didn't know
the drivers were there.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.784
What about the bomb
this morning?

20:20.828 --> 20:24.179
Two more dead.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.442
We found your fingerprint
on the device.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.923
That's impossible.
Okay.

20:28.966 --> 20:31.447
Let's talk about it.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.449
First, you need
to lower the gun.

20:33.493 --> 20:37.148
You're not listening, Dwayne.
I'm leaving.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.760
And you are
staying here

20:39.803 --> 20:43.503
one way or another.

20:43.546 --> 20:46.114
You're not gonna
shoot me, Bernadine.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.682
Today is not my day to die.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.466
I made a mistake.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.903
I was a kid,
and I deserve some grace.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.905
Maybe you can have it

20:54.949 --> 20:56.690
by helping me find

20:56.733 --> 20:58.387
the four other bombs
in the city.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.042
By saving lives.

21:01.085 --> 21:04.175
I don't know anything.You know Yasmin.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.525
I need your help.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.617
Give me the gun.

21:10.660 --> 21:14.838
Give me the gun now.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.145
We can work this out.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.240
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.937
I am so sorry.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.244
SEBASTIAN:
It's 12:05.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.333
It's been over ten hours
since the first bomb went off.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.292
We could already
be out of time.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.119
Pride is bringing
Bernadine back.

21:35.163 --> 21:37.165
She claims she had nothing
to do with the bomb.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.385
Her history and evidence
says different.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.169
Maybe she and Yasmin
were working together.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.257
Well, so who's the
mastermind here?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.389
The former radical
or her protégé?

21:43.432 --> 21:44.868
We're no closer to an answer.

21:44.912 --> 21:47.610
We don't even know where
the other four bombs might be.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.699
Only way to figure that out
is to get one of 'em to talk.

21:49.743 --> 21:51.048
Yeah, classic
prisoner's dilemma.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.528
First one to talk gets the deal.

21:52.572 --> 21:55.401
Need to motivate Yasmin.Yeah. Get her off her game.

21:55.444 --> 21:58.926
Mm-hmm, and out of her armor.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.406
Turn off the plasma

22:00.449 --> 22:02.059
and everything
with a clock on it.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.758
When Pride gets here,
keep 'em here.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.368
LASALLE:
What are you thinking?

22:06.412 --> 22:09.197
Gonna stage a meet-cute.

22:12.374 --> 22:15.551
What the hell?

22:26.345 --> 22:28.042
Come on!

22:28.085 --> 22:30.958
Do you know how expensive
this outfit was?

22:31.001 --> 22:34.440
This is great. I'll go get her.Wait.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.355
Hey!Give her a minute.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.747
Hey! Let me out!

22:44.014 --> 22:46.800
Hey, let me...

22:46.843 --> 22:48.192
Hey!

22:48.236 --> 22:50.325
Let me out.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.677
Oh, my God, I am so, so sorry.
You are soaked.

22:54.721 --> 22:58.246
Is this some kind of trick?

22:58.289 --> 23:01.945
No, it's a complete malfunction
of the sprinkler system.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.470
This was the only
room affected.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.385
Come on, let-let's get
you some dry clothes.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.387
Come on.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.519
I have some sweats
by my desk.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.393
Yasmin?

23:16.046 --> 23:17.874
What happened to you?

23:17.918 --> 23:20.137
Why are you here?

23:20.181 --> 23:21.356
You two shouldn't be talking.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.836
Bernadine...
I'll take her up

23:22.879 --> 23:24.707
to the conference room
for the rest of her statement.

23:28.015 --> 23:29.451
These'll fit you
just fine.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.105
You can change

23:31.148 --> 23:33.412
in the bathroom.

23:34.543 --> 23:35.936
Think this'll work?

23:35.979 --> 23:37.981
No idea. We just can't
sit around here waiting.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.548
FBI tip line's been
ringing off the hook

23:39.592 --> 23:41.115
with suspicious packages
all over town.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.770
Well, let's go follow up
on some tips. You want in?

23:43.813 --> 23:45.685
No, I'm gonna stay
and watch the interrogations.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.295
One of them spills,
I'll let you know.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.645
Oh, God.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.171
Better now?

23:55.869 --> 23:57.653
I will be when
you tell me the time.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.916
Oh, we're not playing
that game anymore, Yasmin.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.222
Countdown's on you.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.702
Bernadine's already talking.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.486
You can't trust
anything she says.

24:04.530 --> 24:07.141
We may not have a choice,
since you won't speak.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.273
She can spin any tale she wants.

24:09.317 --> 24:11.667
She's gonna put the blame on me
when it all falls on her.

24:11.711 --> 24:14.365
Meaning what? She's responsible
for the explosives?

24:14.409 --> 24:15.410
For killing Paul?

24:15.454 --> 24:19.588
She using you,
Yasmin?

24:19.632 --> 24:22.330
Did she convince you
to be her accomplice?

24:22.373 --> 24:23.853
If that's true,

24:23.897 --> 24:26.421
why are you protecting her?

24:26.465 --> 24:29.076
She's gonna walk out of here
and you're gonna go to prison.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.687
Now who's
playing games?

24:31.731 --> 24:34.473
Yasmin, this is
your reality now.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.477
What are you gonna do?

24:38.520 --> 24:40.653
I'm not involved here.
I didn't set any bombs.

24:40.696 --> 24:43.090
I tried to distance
myself from Yasmin.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.309
We got your fingerprint on
the device. How'd that happen?

24:45.353 --> 24:47.529
She found something
that she knew I touched

24:47.573 --> 24:49.357
and she managed
to transfer the print.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.793
Really?

24:50.837 --> 24:52.621
She's capable of a lot worse.
You do not know her.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.275
That's right. We don't.

24:54.318 --> 24:55.537
Dwayne, I spent my entire life

24:55.581 --> 24:57.452
trying to make up
for what I did.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.193
Teaching my students
that you can protest

24:59.236 --> 25:01.238
what is wrong with the world
peacefully.

25:01.282 --> 25:02.805
Well, that loses
a bit of its impact

25:02.849 --> 25:04.415
coming from a killer on the run.

25:04.459 --> 25:05.634
It's the truth.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.201
Dwayne, you know me.
You know my passion.

25:07.244 --> 25:09.464
Now you know why.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.465
Guilt.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.553
Yeah.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.643
Wh-When I realized

25:14.687 --> 25:17.254
that Yasmin wanted to hurt
people, I tried to stop her.

25:17.298 --> 25:19.605
How'd you know
she wanted to hurt people?

25:19.648 --> 25:22.303
Paul discovered that-that
she was researching

25:22.346 --> 25:24.653
how to build bombs,
where to buy the components.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.569
I confronted her. She said that
it was for our next protest.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.485
At the pharmaceutical conference

25:30.529 --> 25:32.095
happening today?
Yeah.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.793
And you didn't call the police.

25:33.836 --> 25:36.360
I sat down with her,
away from school.

25:36.404 --> 25:37.797
I-I took her to the zoo,

25:37.840 --> 25:38.885
which was someplace public.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.974
I told her she was out of S.A.O.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.977
and I tried to explain to her
that violence was not the answer

25:44.020 --> 25:45.108
and we couldn't be affiliated.

25:45.152 --> 25:46.806
And how did she react?

25:46.849 --> 25:49.635
In a rage. She said that
she was gonna go forward

25:49.678 --> 25:51.506
with that plan
no matter what I did.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.509
And you still
didn't call anyone?
No.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.294
I didn't want the police
to investigate

25:57.338 --> 25:58.600
and look into my past.

26:02.952 --> 26:05.085
I don't think she has anything
to do with this.
No.

26:05.128 --> 26:07.000
But the pharma conference
is clearly a target here.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.741
Conference is happening
all over the city.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.481
Could be any number
of the locations.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.005
I'll coordinate
with FBI and ATF.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.573
You tell Hannah about
the scene at the zoo.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.530
Could help her
with Yasmin.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.141
All right.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.928
Listen to what
I'm about to tell you.

26:21.971 --> 26:24.757
Bernadine brought Yasmin
to the zoo.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.586
So, Yasmin, looks like time

26:27.629 --> 26:29.370
is running out.
Bernadine's telling us

26:29.413 --> 26:31.590
quite the story about the zoo.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.548
It's a lie.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.028
So she basically
broke up with you.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.899
She humiliated you.
She cut you off.

26:36.943 --> 26:40.947
Just like your mom cut you off.
You know what's so strange?

26:40.990 --> 26:42.775
We've had agents

26:42.818 --> 26:46.126
trying to call your mom all day,
but she won't answer.

26:46.169 --> 26:49.129
She wants nothing
to do with you.

26:49.172 --> 26:50.913
Feeling's mutual.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.002
What did you do

26:53.046 --> 26:56.440
to earn that kind

26:56.484 --> 26:59.139
of apathy from your mom?

26:59.182 --> 27:02.533
What possible explanation
could you have

27:02.577 --> 27:04.361
for walking out
on your child?

27:04.405 --> 27:07.538
You know, I have a daughter.

27:07.582 --> 27:11.064
She means the world to me.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.979
I don't see her
that often, but...

27:14.894 --> 27:17.244
...I have my reasons.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.507
But your mom,
though--

27:19.550 --> 27:22.466
maybe if you were too dangerous

27:22.510 --> 27:24.512
to handle.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.514
House burned down
when you were 12.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.037
It was deemed
an accident.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.560
There was an investigation.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.519
It was focused mostly on you.

27:33.521 --> 27:36.567
They were as inept as you.

27:36.611 --> 27:37.438
Couldn't prove
anything.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.135
Why?

27:39.179 --> 27:43.618
Why would-- why would someone
burn their own house down?

27:44.793 --> 27:47.796
Maybe because you
were being ignored?

27:48.971 --> 27:51.408
You're a psychologist now?

27:51.452 --> 27:54.455
She hurt you.
You wanted to hurt her back.

27:55.499 --> 27:56.675
This is ridiculous.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.198
And then there's Paul.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.590
He broke up with you

27:59.634 --> 28:02.289
in his car.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.856
I get it now.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.684
I understand.

28:06.510 --> 28:09.252
You understand nothing.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.602
She set me up...Hold that thought.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.174
Yasmin burns down her house

28:18.218 --> 28:19.915
because Mom
wouldn't pay attention.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.525
Paul breaks up
with her in the car.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.745
It explodes
this morning.We got a pattern.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.487
She chooses targets that are
emotionally important to her.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.315
We need to get the bomb squad
to the zoo now.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.800
Everybody,
federal agents!

28:34.843 --> 28:37.280
We need everyone to clear
this area. Let's go.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.760
Tammy says Bernadine
cut ties with Yasmin

28:38.804 --> 28:40.327
somewhere around
the demonstration area.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.807
Something's in there.

28:41.850 --> 28:42.808
What is it?I think someone...

28:42.851 --> 28:43.983
Hey, hey, guys.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.506
I'm just gonna...Guys, hi. Uh, I need you

28:45.549 --> 28:47.029
to move right now, okay?

28:47.073 --> 28:49.423
Okay? Thanks.

28:49.466 --> 28:50.859
Sebastian.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.469
WOMAN: There you go.
Keep moving.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.778
Careful.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.221
This is twice as big
as the one this morning.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.875
We got eyes on the device.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.398
Demonstration seating area.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.313
MAN: Copy that.All right, Sebastian.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.533
Let's roll. Let bomb
squad do their thing.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.927
I'd love to do that,
but there's-there's a...

29:14.970 --> 29:16.667
small hitch in that plan.

29:16.711 --> 29:17.712
What's the hitch?

29:17.756 --> 29:20.454
I may have accidentally

29:20.497 --> 29:22.891
set off a fail-safe
when I lifted up the lid.

29:22.935 --> 29:26.155
Uh, if I move now...

29:26.199 --> 29:27.940
kaboom.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.085
Chris, you notice
how we're pretty much

29:43.129 --> 29:45.087
the only ones here?Yep.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.436
It's 'cause everyone else is

29:46.480 --> 29:47.524
safely outside
of the blast radius.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.352
Uh-huh.

29:49.396 --> 29:52.007
I'm kind of thinking
that you should join them.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.314
Nah. Nah, I kind
of like it here.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.751
Shade is, uh, real nice.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.581
Look, I'm not going
anywhere, Sebastian.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.365
All right?
So, uh,

30:02.409 --> 30:04.106
do what you got to do.

30:04.150 --> 30:06.892
Try not to blow us up.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.329
Um, I found the, uh--

30:09.372 --> 30:11.374
the lead and the blast cap.
There's some, uh,

30:11.418 --> 30:13.420
uh, wire cutters in my bag.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.513
Sure you know what you're doing?

30:19.556 --> 30:21.167
Sure you want to know
the answer?

30:23.517 --> 30:24.866
I'm gonna cut this wire.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.477
Then get to it, Sebastian.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.622
It got real quiet,
so either I defused it

30:41.665 --> 30:42.841
or we're dead.

30:44.364 --> 30:47.715
You defused it.
Good job.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.630
We got something else, too.
Here, look at this.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.458
A way to establish
a timeline.

30:51.501 --> 30:52.938
TAMMY:
The original timer

30:52.981 --> 30:55.505
on the device at the zoo
was set to go off at 3:00 p.m.

30:55.549 --> 30:57.072
So we have less
than two hours to find

30:57.116 --> 30:58.247
those other other three bombs.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.641
Each one capable of
killing hundreds.

31:00.684 --> 31:01.772
We know Yasmin picks
targets that are

31:01.816 --> 31:03.078
emotionally important to her.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.428
Paul's car, the zoo.Yeah, pharma conference.

31:05.472 --> 31:08.910
Though the bomb squad is
still searching for a device.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.608
Where else I don't know.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.176
It took me hours to get anything
out of her at all.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.699
I don't know if we have time
to dig deeper.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.919
What do we do to shake her up?
More sprinklers?

31:17.963 --> 31:21.009
We make her face her rejection.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.449
I've given up on the tea,
but maybe a sandwich?

31:26.493 --> 31:28.712
I'm starving.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.586
What do you want?

31:33.630 --> 31:35.676
To apologize.

31:35.719 --> 31:38.505
You've been through a lot.

31:38.548 --> 31:41.116
I wasn't there for you
the way I should have been.

31:43.249 --> 31:45.642
Happen to know the time?

31:45.686 --> 31:48.384
There's still time
to turn this around.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.908
I know what
you're going through.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.474
I've been through it, too.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.650
I have made the same mistakes,

31:53.694 --> 31:56.305
and the price is too much.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.829
You're right.

31:58.873 --> 32:01.397
You did make mistakes.

32:01.441 --> 32:03.660
Being a coward.

32:03.704 --> 32:07.229
Running all those years ago.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.623
That was a mistake.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.842
What?Giving up on me

32:11.886 --> 32:14.410
when I'm the only one
who understood

32:14.454 --> 32:17.283
what you really wanted,
tried to give it to you.What I wanted?

32:17.326 --> 32:19.502
You want to play them.

32:19.546 --> 32:20.895
Pretend like you're not the
one pulling the strings.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.636
Yasmin, you're lying.

32:22.679 --> 32:25.552
You're the one who loaded
these ideas in my head

32:25.595 --> 32:27.467
like a gun. You're the
one who manipulated me.No.

32:27.510 --> 32:28.947
I... This is all made up.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.645
Your fingerprint's not the only
thing that connects you.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.299
Your credit card was used

32:33.342 --> 32:34.865
for all the components.

32:34.909 --> 32:37.912
You signed for the TNT.
You're tied to this forever.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.436
Why are you doing this
to me, Yasmin?

32:40.480 --> 32:42.525
I am trying to help you.

32:42.569 --> 32:43.962
There's a bomb

32:44.005 --> 32:46.573
so close,
we'll feel it in our teeth.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.184
:
I need your help.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.752
Shutting this down right now.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.590
Yasmin, get away from her.Bernadine.

33:03.633 --> 33:06.462
Looks like someone messed
with her inhaler.

33:06.506 --> 33:07.637
This is Special
Agent Hannah Khoury.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.595
We need an ambulance now.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.470
The inhaler was spiked,
that seems clear.

33:14.514 --> 33:17.169
And whatever was in
it closed her throat.

33:17.212 --> 33:20.041
No way you could have
saved her, Dwayne.Could have kept her

33:20.085 --> 33:22.696
from being alone
in that room with Yasmin.HANNAH: Yeah, but she still

33:22.739 --> 33:24.045
would have used the
inhaler at some point.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.525
She wanted Bernadine dead.

33:25.568 --> 33:26.961
She-- there's no way
she could have known

33:27.005 --> 33:28.484
that it would be here.

33:28.528 --> 33:31.313
No, that was just a bonus.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.968
She set Bernadine up
to be an accomplice.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.101
She may have cut Yasmin out
of the S.A.O.

33:36.144 --> 33:37.711
and out of her life,
but they would have been married

33:37.754 --> 33:39.060
to these bombings forever.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.453
This is a regular
Bonnie and Clyde.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.150
She's controlling the narrative

33:42.194 --> 33:44.152
every step of the way.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.675
I thought... I thought
I could understand her.

33:45.719 --> 33:48.200
I thought I could play her,
but...

33:48.243 --> 33:50.767
she's stringing us along.If it wasn't

33:50.811 --> 33:53.466
for your work, there'd still be
a bomb at the zoo.Yeah,

33:53.509 --> 33:55.903
but that doesn't help us with
the three remaining devices.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.645
It's like you said, Hannah.

33:58.688 --> 34:01.430
She's controlling
the narrative.

34:01.474 --> 34:03.867
She has been
since the beginning.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.305
It's time we take it back.

34:08.698 --> 34:11.440
You look upset.

34:11.484 --> 34:13.181
Guessing Bernadine
didn't make it.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.922
It's too bad because...You killed her.

34:14.965 --> 34:18.186
Plain and simple.
I'm done playing nice with you.

34:18.230 --> 34:20.710
So you've demonstrated.

34:20.754 --> 34:23.452
And I thought
we were becoming so close.

34:23.496 --> 34:27.282
I was trying to help you fix the
mess you've made of your life,

34:27.326 --> 34:29.284
but it is done now.

34:29.328 --> 34:31.808
Life is over.

34:31.852 --> 34:33.723
There she is.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.334
The real person
you've been hiding

34:35.377 --> 34:37.292
under all those sweet promises.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.120
No one knows the real me

34:39.164 --> 34:40.904
or the things
that I did before this

34:40.948 --> 34:42.776
to people way harder than you.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.517
I'm gonna give you
a full demonstration

34:44.560 --> 34:46.127
of what I'm capable of.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.694
Let's get to it, then.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.565
Tell me where the devices are,

34:49.609 --> 34:51.654
or I'm gonna make you
suffer in ways you never...

35:10.804 --> 35:13.415
I told you you could
feel it in your teeth.

35:13.459 --> 35:16.331
Oh, God. The pharma conference.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.333
There's a seminar
across the street.

35:19.813 --> 35:21.771
S.A.O. wanted to stage a sit-in.

35:21.815 --> 35:24.557
Might have gotten
local coverage, but now?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.167
National news.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.777
I should have known.

35:27.821 --> 35:29.039
Well, some sheepdog you are.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.738
I...

35:31.781 --> 35:34.393
What

35:34.436 --> 35:36.525
Come on. This is the good part.

35:36.569 --> 35:38.701
I answer all your questions now.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.835
What's the point?I've been waiting

35:41.878 --> 35:43.619
so patiently.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.187
Let me tell my story.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.842
I only have one question. Why?

35:48.885 --> 35:50.670
Gonna have to be more specific.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.759
I know why you killed Paul
in his car.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.717
I know why you set
the bomb at the zoo

35:54.761 --> 35:57.372
and at the pharma conference.
But the other two?

35:57.416 --> 35:59.809
The provost office
was responsible

35:59.853 --> 36:02.334
for hiring a fugitive
like Bernadine.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.336
No due diligence.

36:04.379 --> 36:07.121
And the last one?

36:07.165 --> 36:10.124
I can't fit it
into the pattern.Because it doesn't fit.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.867
I chose the art museum,
a random tourist attraction,

36:13.910 --> 36:16.348
in case anyone figured out
my pattern.

36:18.350 --> 36:20.352
Thank you, Yasmin.

36:21.831 --> 36:25.661
You... you've been very helpful.

36:25.705 --> 36:28.708
What are you talking about?

36:28.751 --> 36:30.623
You got that, Pride?Yep.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.973
Bomb squad's already on their
way to the last locations.

36:33.016 --> 36:35.845
It's after 3:00 p.m.,
you're too late.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.674
It's 2:15. We got time.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.807
But the explosion.

36:40.850 --> 36:44.419
Yeah, smoke and mirrors.

36:52.035 --> 36:53.863
We found the bomb across the
street a half an hour ago,

36:53.907 --> 36:56.083
so we set off our own
controlled explosion.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.825
SEBASTIAN: The smoke machine's
from our Halloween decorations.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.479
The texts were just something we
came up with in the other room.

37:00.522 --> 37:02.089
PATTON:
And you can download
whatever kind

37:02.132 --> 37:03.656
of sound effect you want
off the Internet.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.267
Speakers are mine, though.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.925
You are a troubled
young lady,

37:11.968 --> 37:14.101
and I'm truly sorry for you.

37:16.451 --> 37:19.454
Told you I'd show you
what I'm capable of.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.642
The two remaining

37:33.686 --> 37:36.341
explosive devices have been
defused and disposed of.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.779
You did good work.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.824
We all did.

37:41.868 --> 37:43.783
Headquarters wants
to present you

37:43.826 --> 37:45.698
with an official commendation.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.830
Have you make
a public statement.

37:47.874 --> 37:51.269
I would just as soon keep my
involvement in this case quiet.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.487
I-I don't need any press.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.707
I had a feeling.
I'll let 'em know.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.317
Thank you.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.666
But you should come
to the Trutone.

37:58.885 --> 38:01.148
Team drinks for free tonight.Oh, wow.

38:01.191 --> 38:02.410
Team always drinks for free.

38:02.454 --> 38:05.108
Yeah, but this time
you all deserve it.

38:05.152 --> 38:07.241
Christopher and Sebastian
are already there.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.808
Oh, maybe I'll see you there.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.810
Okay.

38:10.853 --> 38:13.639
GREGORIO:
If it's paperwork

38:13.682 --> 38:16.250
that's keeping you
from the bar, just...No.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.034
I'm not feeling
that social tonight.

38:18.078 --> 38:19.906
I get it.

38:22.691 --> 38:25.346
If you have a question,
you can ask it.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.569
You told Yasmin
you have a daughter.

38:32.571 --> 38:35.965
Told her a lot of things.Yeah.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.925
But you weren't lying, were you?

38:38.968 --> 38:41.057
Her name's Naomi.

38:41.101 --> 38:44.496
:
She's, um... she's ten.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.760
She here in New Orleans?Yeah.

38:47.803 --> 38:50.284
She's with my ex.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.068
Is that who you were talking
to this morning on the phone?

38:52.112 --> 38:53.505
Wow, you shouldn't expect
to keep any secrets

38:53.548 --> 38:55.289
in a room full
of expert investigators.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.379
No.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.208
Why'd you lie to him,
tell him you were in D.C.?

39:01.251 --> 39:04.342
I... I just haven't had
the courage

39:04.385 --> 39:07.867
to face either of them just yet.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.651
Yeah.

39:09.695 --> 39:12.306
But that is a story
for another day.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.439
Okay.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.876
Well, I'm gonna go to the bar.
You should come.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.921
Oh, maybe.
Maybe I'll see you there.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.489
All right.Okay. Have fun.

39:21.533 --> 39:24.013
Bye.
