00:11.908 --> 00:13.518
Everyone ready for the barbeque?

00:13.828 --> 00:15.178
How's everything coming,

00:15.388 --> 00:15.868
Pops?

00:16.027 --> 00:18.588
I've been making pies all morning!

00:20.068 --> 00:20.808
Skips?

00:20.888 --> 00:22.188
I made Chilli.

00:22.528 --> 00:24.388
Well I have a little surprise.

00:24.638 --> 00:27.198
I was getting excited for the annual barbecue

00:27.198 --> 00:29.678
so in addition for putting on this shirt

00:29.738 --> 00:32.118
I splurged on some Super Extra

00:32.118 --> 00:34.418
Premium Grade A Hot Dogs.

00:34.418 --> 00:37.948
Oh, it's been a while since I had a grilled meat link.

00:38.248 --> 00:39.568
So where'd you get them?

00:39.838 --> 00:40.968
I got them online.

00:40.968 --> 00:42.398
I spared no expense,

00:42.528 --> 00:44.708
I even payed extra for overnight shipping.

00:44.708 --> 00:45.648
Where are they?

00:45.648 --> 00:47.868
Let's throw those babies on the grill.

00:47.868 --> 00:48.998
I gave them to Rigby.

00:50.278 --> 00:53.228
Oh, are Mordecai and Rigby grilling already?

00:53.398 --> 00:54.018
No, no.

00:54.018 --> 00:55.678
I just told them to bring them outside.

00:55.928 --> 00:57.568
I definitely told them NOT

00:57.568 --> 00:58.848
to grill the hot dogs.

00:58.998 --> 01:01.308
Are you sure Benson said
we could grill the hot dogs?

01:01.468 --> 01:03.918
Benson totally said we could grill the hot dogs.

01:03.948 --> 01:05.318
Sweet!

01:05.447 --> 01:07.698
Let's get grilling.

01:07.708 --> 01:09.348
Chillin' and Grillin'!

01:11.828 --> 01:13.918
Benson spared no expense!

01:14.128 --> 01:15.358
Real ingredients?

01:15.528 --> 01:17.678
Dude, these are like luxury hot dogs.

01:21.238 --> 01:22.548
Dude, this thing won't light.

01:23.058 --> 01:24.608
I know how to get that baby going.

01:25.438 --> 01:26.408
Out of my way.

01:29.328 --> 01:30.008
Okay, dude,

01:30.008 --> 01:31.018
I think that's good.

01:31.288 --> 01:31.878
What?

01:34.368 --> 01:35.418
I got it!

01:54.938 --> 01:56.368
Aw, man.

01:56.858 --> 01:59.608
I guess that's why Benson told me NOT to grill.

01:59.608 --> 02:00.388
WHAT?!

02:01.688 --> 02:03.068
I said I was sorry.

02:03.068 --> 02:03.988
Come on, man.

02:04.038 --> 02:04.578
No!

02:04.678 --> 02:06.288
No more "Come on, man"s!

02:06.388 --> 02:08.717
Benson's gonna totally blame me
and it's all your fault!

02:08.828 --> 02:10.717
I'm sick of you always getting me into trouble!

02:10.747 --> 02:12.558
I just wanted to grill time with my bro.

02:12.658 --> 02:13.808
Chillin' and Grillin'.

02:16.068 --> 02:16.498
No.

02:16.598 --> 02:17.158
No, don't.

02:17.158 --> 02:18.468
It's too late.

02:18.468 --> 02:19.718
Come on, dude. Don't!

02:19.718 --> 02:21.288
It's already in motion.

02:21.288 --> 02:22.968
Well, put it out of motion!

02:24.048 --> 02:25.818
You pissed me off.

02:27.008 --> 02:27.838
Dude, no.

02:27.838 --> 02:29.038
Look at me!

02:29.668 --> 02:30.488
Look at me!

02:32.258 --> 02:34.288
If I fix it, will you stop being mad at me?

02:35.018 --> 02:35.708
Maybe.

02:35.708 --> 02:37.048
Fine, I'll fix it.

02:37.148 --> 02:40.398
I'll just go get some more hot dogs
from the meat locker down in the basement.

02:40.398 --> 02:42.398
Benson will never know, ok?

02:43.028 --> 02:43.718
Fine.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.458
You'd better fix it, though.

02:49.368 --> 02:51.368
I hate going down in the meat locker.

02:51.368 --> 02:53.598
Don't worry, it'll be super quick, man!

02:56.748 --> 02:58.278
I'll get the hot dogs, you hold the door.

02:58.408 --> 02:59.248
Fine.

02:59.428 --> 03:00.118
Meat.

03:00.298 --> 03:01.018
Meat.

03:01.088 --> 03:01.778
Meat.

03:01.868 --> 03:02.498
Meat.

03:02.788 --> 03:03.318
Hurry up,

03:03.378 --> 03:04.908
dude! It's freezing.

03:05.418 --> 03:06.408
I can't find them.

03:06.998 --> 03:08.358
I knew you couldn't fix it!

03:08.378 --> 03:08.898
Wait!

03:08.978 --> 03:10.968
I think they're on top, but I can't reach.

03:11.038 --> 03:12.088
I'll grab 'em.

03:12.228 --> 03:13.318
Come hold the door.

03:15.858 --> 03:16.988
I don't see them.

03:17.258 --> 03:18.318
Did you check over there?

03:18.318 --> 03:19.048
Yeah I already...

03:19.048 --> 03:20.258
DUDE WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

03:20.258 --> 03:20.948
THE DOOR!

03:20.978 --> 03:21.718
Oh my gosh!

03:21.718 --> 03:23.988
I tottally propped the door with some bags of ice!

03:24.148 --> 03:24.638
Check it.

03:30.488 --> 03:30.818
Wait!

03:30.818 --> 03:32.508
Wait! I can fix it, there's a safety latch.

03:33.938 --> 03:35.398
Dude, don't force it!

03:38.018 --> 03:39.938
Benson! Skips!

03:39.938 --> 03:41.938
Help!

03:42.098 --> 03:43.438
Help!

03:43.558 --> 03:46.758
Go!

03:53.078 --> 03:54.538
You did it to me again, man!

03:54.748 --> 03:56.538
Don’t worry! I’ll get us out of this!

04:02.438 --> 04:03.618
Just give it up, dude.

04:03.778 --> 04:05.238
I knew you couldn’t fix it.

04:06.848 --> 04:08.528
Dude, I fix stuff all the time!

04:08.528 --> 04:09.638
No, you don’t!

04:09.638 --> 04:10.738
What do you mean?!

04:10.818 --> 04:11.418
The car,

04:11.418 --> 04:12.058
the shoes,

04:12.058 --> 04:12.658
the party,

04:12.658 --> 04:13.578
that other party!

04:13.578 --> 04:14.718
Stop right there!

04:14.718 --> 04:16.317
You know Muscle Man pushed me!

04:16.317 --> 04:17.947
Muscle Man wasn’t even there!

04:18.128 --> 04:19.387
Fine, I’ll fix it!

04:19.387 --> 04:20.938
You mean, like when you fixed the grill?

04:20.947 --> 04:22.908
Or when you fixed the hot dogs by burning them!

04:22.958 --> 04:24.478
Or... Oh, no,
wait, I know!

04:24.568 --> 04:26.258
You mean, like you brought us down here

04:26.258 --> 04:28.318
locked us in the freezer to find more hot dogs?

04:28.828 --> 04:30.108
but, surprise surprise..

04:30.108 --> 04:31.738
there are no hot dogs!

04:31.758 --> 04:32.168
But I can..

04:32.168 --> 04:32.628
No!

04:32.628 --> 04:33.548
Don’t even say it!

04:33.778 --> 04:36.858
Just shut up so I can find a way out
of here before you freeze to death.

04:41.228 --> 04:42.068
Mordecai,

04:42.068 --> 04:43.348
I found the thermostat!

04:43.348 --> 04:45.038
I can totally fix it!

04:45.218 --> 04:45.988
Oh, no!

04:47.058 --> 04:48.858
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DRUMSTICK?!

04:55.028 --> 04:55.638
Mordecai,

04:55.638 --> 04:56.298
I’m sorry!

04:56.328 --> 04:57.418
Let me try and fix it!

04:58.298 --> 04:59.808
I’m sick of you saying that!

04:59.978 --> 05:01.948
You can’t fix this, okay?

05:02.288 --> 05:04.008
All you do is mess things up

05:04.008 --> 05:06.008
and ruin people’s lives!

05:06.558 --> 05:07.408
Sorry..

05:07.488 --> 05:08.708
I just wanted to help..

05:08.818 --> 05:12.288
Stop pretending like you do
anything but get me in trouble!

05:12.488 --> 05:14.338
You can’t fix anything!

05:14.418 --> 05:15.368
And now..

05:15.898 --> 05:17.868
I’m gonna die because of you!

05:19.168 --> 05:19.958
No!

05:21.348 --> 05:22.728
Dude don’t be mad at me!

05:22.748 --> 05:24.828
Mordecai, Don't die mad at me!

05:24.828 --> 05:25.318
Too..

05:25.948 --> 05:26.568
late..

05:27.868 --> 05:28.478
Mordecai?

05:28.688 --> 05:29.298
Mordecai?

05:29.538 --> 05:30.018
Oh no,

05:30.168 --> 05:30.768
oh no.

05:30.918 --> 05:31.988
I can fix this!

05:32.088 --> 05:33.328
I can fix this!

05:35.518 --> 05:36.908
Don’t worry, Mordecai!

05:37.078 --> 05:38.438
I’m gonna take care of us.

05:38.488 --> 05:39.358
You’ll see.

05:52.028 --> 05:53.028
How am I doing?

05:53.608 --> 05:54.178
Mordecai?

05:54.498 --> 05:55.348
Am I doing all right?

05:56.678 --> 05:58.548
“Yeah, Rigby, you’re doing good!”

06:15.298 --> 06:16.358
Hot dogs!

06:16.708 --> 06:18.358
I’ve been looking all over for you!

06:18.778 --> 06:20.358
Please, frozen stranger!

06:20.358 --> 06:21.498
Can you free us?

06:22.028 --> 06:23.208
Yeah, I can free you.

06:23.418 --> 06:25.058
But you gonna have to do something for me.

06:25.308 --> 06:26.288
Here’s what you gotta do..

06:31.628 --> 06:33.118
Hey, Mordecai!

06:33.268 --> 06:34.538
Margaret!

06:34.858 --> 06:36.618
You look stunning!

06:38.988 --> 06:39.918
Spin with me!

06:41.988 --> 06:43.378
Oh, Mordecai!

06:43.428 --> 06:45.038
Oh, Margaret!

06:46.218 --> 06:47.438
Mordecai!

06:47.438 --> 06:49.538
I’M GONNA FIX IT!

06:52.818 --> 06:53.578
Rigby?

06:55.568 --> 06:56.298
you’re awake!

06:56.298 --> 06:57.728
Mordecai.

06:57.728 --> 06:59.028
I told you I can fix it!

06:59.258 --> 07:00.048
While you were dead,

07:00.098 --> 07:01.528
I found those talking hot dogs

07:01.528 --> 07:02.538
and they gonna help us.

07:02.538 --> 07:03.048
What?

07:03.178 --> 07:04.478
They said they know the way out!

07:04.548 --> 07:05.468
It’s true.

07:05.608 --> 07:07.728
We can guide you out of the meat locker.

07:07.908 --> 07:10.978
But only if you will agree to take us to a barbecue

07:10.978 --> 07:12.978
where we can be eaten!

07:13.048 --> 07:13.668
What?!

07:13.818 --> 07:15.668
You WANT to be eaten?

07:15.838 --> 07:16.958
Yes!

07:17.058 --> 07:19.928
It is our destiny to be eaten!

07:19.988 --> 07:20.518
Dude.

07:20.598 --> 07:21.548
This is weird.

07:21.718 --> 07:23.848
Benson’s gonna know these
are not hot dogs he bought.

07:23.918 --> 07:24.688
Look at them!

07:24.948 --> 07:26.968
No! He won’t know! Just trust me!

07:27.038 --> 07:28.508
I promise, it’ll work out!

07:28.598 --> 07:30.188
Do we have a deal?

07:32.548 --> 07:34.128
It’s a deal!

07:42.028 --> 07:43.348
Dude, this is the way out!

07:47.328 --> 07:48.248
Dude, they are not here yet!

07:48.248 --> 07:49.398
We still have time!

07:58.078 --> 08:00.718
Man, I can’t wait for those hot dogs!

08:00.808 --> 08:01.918
Here they come.

08:02.038 --> 08:03.508
This'd better work.

08:03.558 --> 08:05.348
It’ll work! Just relax!

08:08.338 --> 08:10.798
Hey, Benson, I’ve got the hot dogs right here.

08:10.798 --> 08:12.988
I didn’t grill ‘em, just like you said.

08:13.098 --> 08:16.118
Oh, boy, this is gonna be the best barbecue ever!

08:16.368 --> 08:16.978
NOW!

08:17.058 --> 08:17.898
What the..

08:17.898 --> 08:19.418
What the heck are those..

08:27.548 --> 08:29.118
This wasn’t a part of a deal!

08:32.568 --> 08:33.207
Wait!

08:35.168 --> 08:36.738
You fell for our trap!

08:36.868 --> 08:37.918
Brilliantly!

08:38.068 --> 08:39.918
We don’t want to be eaten!

08:40.028 --> 08:41.628
We want to eat..

08:41.698 --> 08:42.648
YOU!

08:42.977 --> 08:44.408
But what about the prophecy?

08:44.488 --> 08:46.818
There is no prophecy!

08:47.038 --> 08:48.968
This is simply revenge!

08:49.038 --> 08:52.348
For all our fallen brother and sister hot dogs

08:52.488 --> 08:55.818
massacred by the hand of your barbecue!

08:56.178 --> 08:57.428
And now..

08:57.428 --> 08:59.538
You’ll join your friends

08:59.608 --> 09:02.348
are awaiting a similar fate!

09:03.798 --> 09:05.208
Help, Rigby!

09:05.208 --> 09:06.648
Bad show.

09:06.648 --> 09:08.358
Help!

09:08.518 --> 09:09.158
No!

09:09.208 --> 09:10.458
What are you doing to them?

09:10.638 --> 09:13.168
Marinating them, of course!

09:13.238 --> 09:14.708
Bag the last one!

09:30.968 --> 09:31.838
Stand back, man!

09:31.868 --> 09:32.688
Stand back!

09:41.228 --> 09:43.108
This stuff’s delicious!

10:09.328 --> 10:10.778
What the heck was that?

10:10.778 --> 10:11.658
What did you do?!

10:12.708 --> 10:13.848
Yeah, Rigby.

10:13.848 --> 10:15.488
What did you do?

10:20.198 --> 10:21.138
Don’t look at me!

10:21.168 --> 10:25.288
Benson’s the one who went and bought
the crazy Super Premium Psycho Hot Dogs!

10:26.678 --> 10:27.598
He’s right!

10:27.688 --> 10:29.928
I indeed remember now.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.168
Yeah, he’s right!

10:31.898 --> 10:34.478
This wouldn't've happened if you'd
just bought regular hot dogs!

10:34.478 --> 10:35.608
That’s for sure!

10:35.608 --> 10:36.708
That is true!

10:36.708 --> 10:37.258
No, but..

10:37.258 --> 10:38.488
I don’t know what happened..

10:38.568 --> 10:40.978
Well, I guess the barbecue is ruined now

10:40.978 --> 10:42.298
thanks to Benson!

10:42.298 --> 10:43.228
What?!
No!

10:43.378 --> 10:44.918
No, I can fix it!

10:44.988 --> 10:46.828
Quick! Go and buy some hot dogs from the

10:46.828 --> 10:48.828
store and make sure they’re regular.

10:49.648 --> 10:50.598
I’m sorry, guys!

10:50.618 --> 10:51.648
Minor setback.

10:51.648 --> 10:54.378
I hope the overnight shipping was worth it!

10:54.868 --> 10:55.508
Dude,

10:55.508 --> 10:56.858
that was awesome!

10:56.908 --> 10:58.428
I told you I’d fix it!

10:58.498 --> 11:00.428
I knew that you would.
