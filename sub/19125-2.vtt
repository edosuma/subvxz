00:01.564 --> 00:04.365
<i>McKenzie: Previously on
Face Off All-Stars...</i>

00:04.401 --> 00:05.333
- Whoa.
- What?

00:06.770 --> 00:10.004
Everything you think you know
about Face Off,

00:10.040 --> 00:11.940
you can just
throw out the window.

00:11.975 --> 00:13.675
Oh, shit.

00:13.710 --> 00:16.077
We won't be eliminating a team
every week.

00:16.113 --> 00:17.779
McKenzie legitimately scares me.

00:17.814 --> 00:20.482
<i>McKenzie: Using green screen
technology for the first time,</i>

00:20.517 --> 00:21.749
<i>Keaghlan and Melissa
earned immunity</i>

00:21.785 --> 00:23.485
<i>for the next
Spotlight Challenge,</i>

00:23.520 --> 00:25.787
<i>but Ben and Evan and Stella
and Jasmine fell to the bottom</i>

00:25.822 --> 00:28.957
<i>and are in danger going into
this week's elimination.</i>

00:28.992 --> 00:31.259
We need to make a comeback.

00:31.294 --> 00:32.527
<i>McKenzie:
Tonight, the competition</i>

00:32.561 --> 00:33.761
<i>takes a devilish twist.</i>

00:33.797 --> 00:37.232
You will be applying both
makeups to one model.

00:38.335 --> 00:39.534
This is not working.

00:39.569 --> 00:40.869
<i>This is gonna look like a mask.</i>

00:40.904 --> 00:42.604
We're totally screwed.

00:42.639 --> 00:44.172
<i>McKenzie: Find out what happens
next.</i>

00:44.207 --> 00:46.941
This is Face Off All-Stars.

01:29.753 --> 01:31.352
It's the morning
of our next challenge

01:31.388 --> 01:33.521
and we come up to this church.

01:33.557 --> 01:34.756
This is pretty sweet.

01:34.791 --> 01:37.458
<i>Since this is our first
elimination challenge,</i>

01:37.494 --> 01:38.560
we don't want to hold back.

01:41.665 --> 01:42.764
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my God.</i>

01:42.799 --> 01:44.699
<i>- This is beautiful.
- This is gorgeous.</i>

01:44.734 --> 01:46.668
<i>We're all walking down the aisle</i>

01:46.703 --> 01:48.169
<i>and we see McKenzie
standing there,</i>

01:48.205 --> 01:50.738
and I'm secretly hoping
that Niko set the whole thing up

01:50.774 --> 01:52.307
<i>and he was gonna
have McKenzie marry us</i>

01:52.342 --> 01:53.841
<i>'cause, you know,
she's ordained,</i>

01:53.877 --> 01:55.109
but missed opportunity.

01:55.145 --> 01:56.044
Just saying.

01:57.347 --> 01:59.514
- Hey, guys.
all: - Hi.

01:59.549 --> 02:02.784
Welcome to the beautiful
Westminster Presbyterian Church

02:02.819 --> 02:03.751
in Pasadena.

02:03.787 --> 02:06.387
You know, they say
that religious architecture

02:06.423 --> 02:09.357
is designed to make you stop
and reflect,

02:09.392 --> 02:11.859
so I brought you here today
because your next

02:11.895 --> 02:15.997
Spotlight Challenge will require
you to look deep inside.

02:16.032 --> 02:19.434
Now, we all have both good
and evil traits inside of us,

02:19.469 --> 02:21.836
and we've seen them in movies
and television shows

02:21.871 --> 02:25.073
as the angel and devil
sitting on opposing shoulders

02:25.108 --> 02:27.141
trying to influence
your behavior,

02:27.177 --> 02:31.479
so in this Spotlight Challenge,
each team will be creating

02:31.514 --> 02:35.016
two makeups...
an angel and a devil character.

02:35.051 --> 02:36.017
Sweet.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.921
I'm a theology nerd
and I have tons of ideas,

02:39.956 --> 02:41.022
so I'm stoked.

02:41.057 --> 02:43.324
But of course there's more.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.261
First, you'll need to use
one of your own good traits

02:46.296 --> 02:50.064
and one of your bad traits to
inspire your angels and devils.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.332
- All right.
- Wow.

02:51.368 --> 02:53.701
Second, we're going
to ask you to do something

02:53.737 --> 02:56.704
that has never been done
before on the show.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.673
Oh.

02:58.708 --> 03:01.576
Because everyone has both
an angel and a devil inside,

03:01.611 --> 03:04.979
you will be applying
both makeups to one model.

03:05.015 --> 03:06.848
- Oh, cool.
- Sweet.

03:06.883 --> 03:07.782
Cool.

03:07.817 --> 03:10.585
I have never created
a two-in-one makeup,

03:10.620 --> 03:13.454
<i>so finding a way to marry
the two of those,</i>

03:13.490 --> 03:14.989
it's gonna be really
challenging.

03:15.025 --> 03:18.326
It's up to you to decide
how you are going to incorporate

03:18.361 --> 03:21.529
both characters
into one creation,

03:21.564 --> 03:24.799
but the judges will need
to see both clearly reflected

03:24.834 --> 03:26.167
in your final creations.

03:26.202 --> 03:29.937
Go ahead and select your traits
and get started on your designs.

03:29.973 --> 03:31.539
- Good luck, guys.
all: - Thank you.

03:31.574 --> 03:32.173
Bye.

03:37.847 --> 03:39.714
I think we're both very
focused on each...

03:39.749 --> 03:41.382
on, like, ourselves.

03:41.418 --> 03:42.583
Okay, so selfishness.

03:42.619 --> 03:44.552
For our good traits
and bad traits, we agreed

03:44.587 --> 03:46.454
that we're both
a little bit selfish,

03:46.489 --> 03:49.724
but we're also very giving
emotionally a lot to people.

03:49.759 --> 03:52.026
The demon would come out
when you see that it's just

03:52.062 --> 03:53.795
a skin that it's wearing,

03:53.830 --> 03:56.597
and the back of it
is this demon with horns.

03:56.633 --> 03:59.133
The devil is actually
this parasite who is living

03:59.169 --> 04:02.403
<i>inside of the angel, so we're
gonna try and have a good,</i>

04:02.439 --> 04:04.672
strong contrast
to the open hands

04:04.708 --> 04:08.242
<i>by creating these laced hands
on the back with a spine.</i>

04:08.278 --> 04:09.277
That's a good idea.

04:14.684 --> 04:19.087
I was thinking about the angel
representing, like, kindness

04:19.122 --> 04:20.654
and giving.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.423
That's... that's definitely
my trait too.

04:22.459 --> 04:25.193
We decide our angel
is going to be

04:25.228 --> 04:28.963
unconditionally selfless
to the devil character,

04:28.998 --> 04:31.866
<i>who is taking advantage
of that kindness,</i>

04:31.901 --> 04:34.335
<i>and the devil's eating
the angel.</i>

04:34.371 --> 04:36.471
What if we sculpted another...
kind of like a back

04:36.506 --> 04:39.240
with his devil wings on it?

04:39.275 --> 04:40.575
We're going too big.

04:40.610 --> 04:42.176
No, no, let's slow down.
Let's pump the brakes.

04:42.212 --> 04:44.011
Ben and I don't want to be
on the bottom again,

04:44.047 --> 04:46.748
<i>so this is an awesome
opportunity to redeem ourselves</i>

04:46.783 --> 04:48.983
by creating a really unique,
cool makeup.

04:52.889 --> 04:55.823
Demons have horns
because it's a broken halo.

04:55.859 --> 04:56.924
Mm-hmm.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.060
So I like the idea
that our guy has something

04:59.095 --> 05:02.263
that could be seen as horns, but
they're just starting to break.

05:02.298 --> 05:04.999
Keaghlan and I want our angel
to represent structure and order

05:05.034 --> 05:06.534
an also selflessness

05:06.569 --> 05:10.405
<i>being consumed by this evil,
self-critical devil.</i>

05:10.440 --> 05:14.642
We're going to fabricate
and sculpt parts of a bodysuit

05:14.677 --> 05:17.645
that'll be this demon
consuming our angel.

05:21.684 --> 05:24.051
The bad trait is...

05:24.087 --> 05:25.453
it can be anything.

05:25.488 --> 05:28.823
Jasmine and I are trying
to see which traits will work,

05:28.858 --> 05:31.259
<i>and we're looking at each other
like, "Uh...</i>

05:31.294 --> 05:32.493
I don't know, you tell me."

05:32.529 --> 05:34.028
Maybe those psychic vampires

05:34.063 --> 05:35.563
that suck the life
out of people.

05:35.598 --> 05:38.833
I was thinking that we could
put the devil on the chest.

05:38.868 --> 05:41.836
The head and the heart
are at odds with each other.

05:41.871 --> 05:43.471
We're bouncing ideas
off each other,

05:43.506 --> 05:47.141
and it's hard to emulate
two characters on one body,

05:47.177 --> 05:50.044
<i>and that's what's making
this so difficult.</i>

05:50.079 --> 05:52.980
So at this point,
Stella and I have no concept,

05:53.016 --> 05:55.883
and I know that if you have
no concept,

05:55.919 --> 05:56.984
you're gone.

06:10.700 --> 06:11.899
What are your traits?

06:11.935 --> 06:14.469
Me and Logan like to take care
of people we love,

06:14.504 --> 06:16.504
so protection, guardian.

06:16.539 --> 06:18.940
Logan doesn't really have any
bad traits, so I'm doing mine,

06:18.975 --> 06:20.308
which is lust.

06:20.343 --> 06:21.509
Oh!

06:23.112 --> 06:25.580
<i>I'm trying to come at it
from a very abstract,</i>

06:25.615 --> 06:28.115
non-traditional way,
and I'm really,

06:28.151 --> 06:29.951
really worried about
going too literal with it.

06:29.986 --> 06:32.286
<i>So we decided
to go for a guardian angel</i>

06:32.322 --> 06:35.590
<i>who is being seduced
by a very beautiful devil</i>

06:35.625 --> 06:36.991
<i>caressing him to the dark side.</i>

06:37.026 --> 06:38.860
I'm gonna start throwing
some clay on here.

06:38.895 --> 06:39.727
By all means.

06:46.436 --> 06:48.135
- Happy birthday, Tyler Green.
- Thanks!

06:48.171 --> 06:49.070
Happy birthday!

06:50.206 --> 06:51.172
What are your traits?

06:51.207 --> 06:52.640
- Creativity...
- Okay.

06:52.675 --> 06:54.242
And our bad trait
is self-doubt.

06:54.277 --> 06:55.510
Ah.

06:55.545 --> 06:58.012
And they're constantly warring
with one another.

06:58.047 --> 07:00.414
<i>We're creating
an angel character</i>

07:00.450 --> 07:04.252
who is chiseling armor
out of this stone

07:04.287 --> 07:06.954
<i>that is literally
weighing her down.</i>

07:06.990 --> 07:08.723
How much do you plan
on changing the face?

07:08.758 --> 07:09.957
I'm gonna subtly change it.

07:09.993 --> 07:12.426
I want to make it more
beautiful, more renaissance.

07:12.462 --> 07:13.327
Yeah, okay.

07:19.636 --> 07:22.436
Ours is loyalty and jealousy.

07:22.472 --> 07:23.437
Oh.

07:23.473 --> 07:24.672
Interesting.

07:24.707 --> 07:26.474
The plot thickens.

07:26.509 --> 07:27.975
Dun, dun, dun!

07:28.011 --> 07:30.211
We wanted to incorporate a lot
of our relationship

07:30.246 --> 07:33.447
<i>into our makeup, and since
we're getting prepared</i>

07:33.483 --> 07:35.516
for the next step
in our relationship,

07:35.552 --> 07:38.519
<i>we're gonna make the angel
character into a bride.</i>

07:38.555 --> 07:41.355
This you actually
have to sculpt a breast,

07:41.391 --> 07:43.958
and you would only be able
to see a hint of this.

07:43.993 --> 07:45.426
We're counting on
the bridal aspect

07:45.461 --> 07:47.461
to help the sell
the loyalty factor,

07:47.497 --> 07:49.997
<i>and the jealousy is rotting her
from the inside out,</i>

07:50.033 --> 07:52.099
so you can see her transforming
into this devil.

07:52.135 --> 07:54.435
It can be, like, pretty simple.

07:54.470 --> 07:55.736
Not too much texture

07:55.772 --> 07:57.605
because you're putting on
the texture after, right?

07:57.640 --> 07:58.472
Yeah.

08:07.083 --> 08:13.020
What's tricky is this whole
angel and devil on one person.

08:13.056 --> 08:14.355
Yes, I know.

08:14.390 --> 08:16.190
We're still wasting time
trying to figure out

08:16.225 --> 08:17.558
<i>what it is we're even gonna do.</i>

08:17.594 --> 08:19.393
You want to go with fear?

08:19.429 --> 08:20.795
Yeah, I like that.
I like...

08:20.830 --> 08:22.930
Imposter.

08:22.966 --> 08:24.198
Courage.

08:24.233 --> 08:26.000
I'm like, "Okay,
we'll go with this one idea

08:26.035 --> 08:29.804
<i>where we portray the devil
as this goat-like character,</i>

08:29.839 --> 08:32.472
<i>and the angel
is busting through."</i>

08:33.610 --> 08:34.842
<i>It's not the best idea,</i>

08:34.876 --> 08:36.876
<i>but we're gonna run
with the concept</i>

08:36.913 --> 08:38.412
and see how it all works out.

08:46.089 --> 08:48.389
Our angel has compassion,

08:48.424 --> 08:52.093
<i>and she is taken over
by our devil, guilt,</i>

08:52.128 --> 08:55.029
who is eroding her away.

08:55.064 --> 08:56.364
I just took the window
of the church

08:56.399 --> 08:57.365
and just flipped it upside down.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.332
That's dope.

08:58.368 --> 08:59.367
I think that'll create the shape

08:59.402 --> 09:00.401
to go along with what you have.

09:00.436 --> 09:01.669
Yeah, that's dope.

09:01.704 --> 09:03.270
We see a lot of the architecture
in the church that we want

09:03.306 --> 09:05.673
<i>to incorporate for the angel,
so Tyler and I feel that</i>

09:05.708 --> 09:10.711
<i>creating a statue would justify
the architecture in the piece</i>

09:10.747 --> 09:14.215
because living creatures don't
have filigree all over them.

09:18.421 --> 09:21.255
Well, what do you think about
the direction I'm going?

09:21.290 --> 09:22.823
Are you worried about it?

09:22.859 --> 09:25.359
Just making sure
we're not going too big.

09:25.395 --> 09:27.895
<i>Having been on the bottom
in the first challenge</i>

09:27.930 --> 09:30.297
<i>definitely makes you
second guess yourself.</i>

09:30.333 --> 09:31.832
It's all self-doubt now.

09:31.868 --> 09:33.100
That's one of our weaknesses.

09:33.136 --> 09:36.170
<i>The cowl is starting
to look like a devil hoodie,</i>

09:36.205 --> 09:38.973
and I'm pretty sure
that's not gonna play well.

09:39.008 --> 09:41.275
Yeah, dude, it's gonna
look like a fucking mask.

09:41.310 --> 09:44.011
I just don't think there's
enough angel in that.

09:44.047 --> 09:45.379
I agree.

09:45.415 --> 09:48.449
It's so important that we have
a great makeup on stage,

09:48.484 --> 09:51.285
and this isn't gonna work out,

09:51.320 --> 09:55.956
so I start ripping off all
of this devil hoodie nonsense.

09:55.992 --> 09:58.592
<i>This is, like,
going from a hundred to zero,</i>

09:58.628 --> 10:01.929
<i>and now I need to immediately
start building a new one</i>

10:01.964 --> 10:04.432
'cause otherwise
we're totally screwed.

10:11.197 --> 10:12.129
Gonna get rid of this.

10:12.165 --> 10:13.431
I don't need this.

10:13.466 --> 10:17.034
This devil cowl is becoming
way too large,

10:17.070 --> 10:20.071
<i>so I just start ripping off
all of the clay</i>

10:20.106 --> 10:23.174
and start blocking out
the head of the devil.

10:23.209 --> 10:24.909
I'm gonna build it out
back here.

10:24.944 --> 10:26.677
Okay.

10:26.713 --> 10:30.281
<i>Evan and I want to go back
to what we originally planned.</i>

10:30.316 --> 10:33.651
Just clean, simple makeups,
and so our new concept

10:33.686 --> 10:35.886
<i>is that the devil
will essentially be</i>

10:35.922 --> 10:38.723
<i>wrapping his arms around her
and absorbing her,</i>

10:38.758 --> 10:40.925
so we want to have,
like, a stretch of the skin

10:40.960 --> 10:42.593
into the devil's face.

10:49.235 --> 10:50.367
Hi, everybody.

10:50.403 --> 10:52.870
All: Hi.

10:52.905 --> 10:54.305
So tell me
what you're gonna be doing.

10:54.340 --> 10:57.408
<i>We decided to go more subtle
with our appliances.</i>

10:57.443 --> 10:59.710
We're gonna do a beauty makeup
on this side

10:59.746 --> 11:00.911
and then this side's gonna be...

11:00.947 --> 11:02.880
- Dark and decayed.
- Dark and emaciated.

11:02.915 --> 11:03.881
A lot of black.

11:03.916 --> 11:05.382
Careful with the black.

11:05.418 --> 11:08.419
You're doing all this wonderful
little wrinkles here,

11:08.454 --> 11:11.188
and you don't want to bring
so much dark color into it

11:11.224 --> 11:12.156
you're gonna lose them.

11:12.191 --> 11:13.390
Both: Okay.

11:13.426 --> 11:15.292
The demon is actually
gonna be facing the same way

11:15.328 --> 11:17.294
as the angel,
like he's wearing the face.

11:17.330 --> 11:20.097
<i>And there's gonna be a set
of broken-off wings.</i>

11:20.133 --> 11:22.767
- You're probably 80% devil...
- Okay.

11:22.802 --> 11:25.536
And this is all you have
to go with your angel, so...

11:25.571 --> 11:27.972
Do you think instead of making
them the devil's wings,

11:28.007 --> 11:30.407
we should make them
the angel's wings?

11:30.443 --> 11:34.044
Or make one really broken
and make one that's a little bit

11:34.080 --> 11:35.146
more angel-like.

11:35.181 --> 11:37.114
That's a great suggestion,
actually.

11:37.150 --> 11:38.449
So we have a guardian angel

11:38.484 --> 11:41.118
<i>and inside he has this devil
of lust.</i>

11:41.154 --> 11:42.987
This face here,
is that a face cast?

11:43.022 --> 11:45.422
I got a clay press
of the model I liked best

11:45.458 --> 11:46.390
and pressed it in there.

11:46.425 --> 11:47.424
Very nice.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.993
As long as it's clay.

11:49.028 --> 11:50.728
She shouldn't be peacefully
at rest.

11:50.763 --> 11:52.630
Give her a little bit
of an expression.

11:52.665 --> 11:53.764
Okay.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.134
So we are kind of going
in this devil realm.

11:57.170 --> 11:58.702
Now, how are you bringing in
the angel?

11:58.738 --> 12:00.604
With an open heart.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.672
Okay.

12:01.707 --> 12:06.210
You're looking like
you are 90% devil.

12:06.245 --> 12:08.512
What if he had wings?

12:08.548 --> 12:10.281
- And we kind of...
- I think that'd be confusing.

12:10.316 --> 12:12.016
Because then
you're talking about

12:12.051 --> 12:13.317
here's a devil with wings on it.

12:13.352 --> 12:14.518
Okay.

12:14.554 --> 12:16.287
Well, good-bye and good luck
to everybody.

12:16.322 --> 12:17.254
- Bye.
- Thank you.

12:17.290 --> 12:18.255
- Thanks.
- Bye.

12:23.129 --> 12:24.528
You want me to help you
build that up?

12:24.564 --> 12:25.896
Uh, yeah.

12:25.932 --> 12:28.999
I finished sculpting the cowl
and Tyler finishes the back,

12:29.035 --> 12:31.302
<i>so now we're gonna
start molding.</i>

12:32.605 --> 12:34.071
Getting ready
to blow out my candles.

12:34.106 --> 12:35.272
I know, right?

12:35.308 --> 12:38.075
<i>The whole idea is to patina
this entire model,</i>

12:38.110 --> 12:40.177
<i>and it's so important
to have the time</i>

12:40.213 --> 12:41.378
<i>to pre-paint everything,</i>

12:41.414 --> 12:43.881
so we need to get these pieces
finished today.

12:49.822 --> 12:52.623
Bring the muscle
down to the shoulders.

12:53.826 --> 12:54.725
You know what I'm saying?

12:54.760 --> 12:55.860
- No.
- No?

12:55.895 --> 13:00.764
This is just not working,
so we go outside

13:00.800 --> 13:02.466
<i>to figure this out.</i>

13:02.501 --> 13:04.201
I don't think our idea is bad.

13:04.237 --> 13:05.836
But it's not reading "angel."

13:05.872 --> 13:06.871
We just got to do more.

13:06.906 --> 13:07.872
Girl, you being stubborn.

13:07.907 --> 13:09.473
<i>We keep just going
back and forth.</i>

13:09.508 --> 13:11.542
I'm like, "You're so stubborn."

13:11.577 --> 13:13.477
<i>Clearly, it's a trait
we both have,</i>

13:13.512 --> 13:15.312
<i>so we're gonna do a bull</i>

13:15.348 --> 13:18.315
'cause bullheadedness
represents stubbornness.

13:18.351 --> 13:19.650
So we could have the bull horns.

13:19.685 --> 13:20.851
Mm-hmm.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.753
And then we do, like,
some sort of filigree design

13:22.788 --> 13:25.089
that indicates
openness of the heart.

13:25.124 --> 13:26.924
<i>This angel that's stuck
inside of him</i>

13:26.959 --> 13:28.726
is pushing out some wings,

13:28.761 --> 13:32.396
<i>so he has wing nubs that are
going to be emanating light.</i>

13:32.431 --> 13:34.565
<i>Hopefully we're going
to make it work.</i>

13:43.809 --> 13:45.542
That's time, everyone!

13:45.578 --> 13:47.211
- Good job.
- Good job, you.

13:47.246 --> 13:49.380
Join me!
Come on, guys!

13:49.415 --> 13:51.048
Tyler, come over here!

13:51.083 --> 13:52.983
Come hang out.

13:53.019 --> 13:54.885
- It's our little living room.
- This is so nice.

13:54.921 --> 13:55.819
What?

13:58.157 --> 14:00.324
<i>All of a sudden,
cupcakes come my way,</i>

14:00.359 --> 14:01.959
and I'm just like,
"Oh, my gosh."

14:03.462 --> 14:04.962
<i>It's totally amazing
that I'm able to spend</i>

14:04.997 --> 14:06.563
<i>my birthday here on Face Off.</i>

14:06.599 --> 14:08.832
Well, we knew that you were,
like, sad that you couldn't

14:08.868 --> 14:10.000
be with your real family today.

14:10.036 --> 14:11.135
That's awesome.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.202
So you're with
your Face Off family.

14:12.238 --> 14:13.337
That's right!
Face Off family.

14:13.372 --> 14:14.538
Yeah.

14:23.616 --> 14:24.615
- Whoo.
- Whoo!

14:24.650 --> 14:25.582
Yeah, go team!

14:27.019 --> 14:29.119
Hey, friend, how you doing?

14:29.155 --> 14:31.588
The first thing that I need to
get done is finish the sculpture

14:31.624 --> 14:35.559
<i>of the face piece while Melissa
finishes detailing the torso.</i>

14:35.594 --> 14:37.962
Because our face sculpt
is so in-organic

14:37.997 --> 14:40.197
<i>and it's really all about
symmetry, we want to make sure</i>

14:40.232 --> 14:42.433
<i>that I spend
as much time as necessary</i>

14:42.468 --> 14:46.070
so that it really feels
like a statue character.

14:46.105 --> 14:47.671
We can always fabricate that.

14:47.707 --> 14:49.673
I will not have spent
all that time on that.

14:50.643 --> 14:51.809
No.

14:51.844 --> 14:53.344
The devil came out of me.

14:53.379 --> 14:55.913
I think it's a risk spending
most of my time on the halo,

14:55.948 --> 14:59.316
<i>but I think it could pay off
in a really good way.</i>

15:06.392 --> 15:08.192
Look at that.
It's cool.

15:08.227 --> 15:09.760
Ben's arm is looking amazing.

15:09.795 --> 15:12.963
<i>The face is looking awesome,
so we're just really happy</i>

15:12.999 --> 15:15.232
that we get to actually
show our sculpting skills

15:15.267 --> 15:16.834
as opposed to
the first challenge.

15:16.869 --> 15:18.736
The devil has a horn
and the angel has a halo.

15:18.771 --> 15:20.871
We're a little bit worried
that it's too on the nose,

15:20.906 --> 15:22.306
but you know what?

15:22.341 --> 15:25.309
<i>It's angel and devil and
to represent it metaphorically</i>

15:25.344 --> 15:28.245
seems wrong, so I think we're
doing the right thing.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.681
I'm not gonna feel bad about
being eliminated on this

15:30.716 --> 15:32.182
because it's awesome.

15:36.389 --> 15:38.022
Fingers, fingers, fingers.

15:38.057 --> 15:40.424
It's really important
for our character that we convey

15:40.459 --> 15:43.994
selfishness through the fingers
lacing on the back section,

15:44.030 --> 15:47.731
<i>so Gage and I make
a press mold out of silicone</i>

15:47.767 --> 15:50.300
because sculpting those fingers
is gonna take a while.

15:51.504 --> 15:53.537
<i>Now I can use
some of the wet clay</i>

15:53.572 --> 15:56.840
<i>to push into the mold
and make myself fingers</i>

15:56.876 --> 15:58.175
that I could put into the back.

15:58.210 --> 15:59.276
Do you think it reads as spine?

15:59.311 --> 16:00.210
- That's my biggest issue.
- Totally.

16:00.246 --> 16:01.311
Yeah.
Really?

16:01.347 --> 16:02.446
Absolutely.

16:05.484 --> 16:07.384
You gonna be ready to mold
anytime soon, Adam,

16:07.420 --> 16:08.385
do you think?

16:08.421 --> 16:09.620
I think so.

16:09.655 --> 16:11.422
I get the devil face to a point
where I can mold it,

16:11.457 --> 16:14.124
<i>but there's a lot of details
and a lot of nuances</i>

16:14.160 --> 16:16.226
in the sculpture,
and I'm really worried

16:16.262 --> 16:18.462
about having enough time
to paint it on application day.

16:18.497 --> 16:19.463
What's on your mind, dude?

16:19.498 --> 16:20.497
Nothing.
It's just me.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.032
It's my internal
artist struggle.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.934
If you don't have time
to paint it and make it pop,

16:23.969 --> 16:26.103
it really doesn't matter how
much effort you put into it,

16:26.138 --> 16:28.072
<i>but at this point we have
to execute what we have</i>

16:28.107 --> 16:29.673
and hopefully do it well.

16:36.015 --> 16:37.881
Yesterday,
we wasted so much time

16:37.917 --> 16:40.250
<i>trying to figure out how
to portray these traits</i>

16:40.286 --> 16:42.986
<i>that we have to scramble
to get everything done.</i>

16:43.022 --> 16:46.657
Now we're going to open
a really crap-ily made mold

16:46.692 --> 16:49.793
for our wing nubs
that has been rushed

16:49.829 --> 16:51.628
<i>'cause we have very little time.</i>

16:51.664 --> 16:52.930
Ooh, it's so squishy.

16:52.965 --> 16:55.199
Ooh, it did not set.
Fuck.

16:55.234 --> 16:58.001
Even though it's hard
on the outside,

16:58.037 --> 16:59.970
<i>it's still soft on the inside.</i>

17:00.005 --> 17:01.171
We might have to re-mold it.

17:01.207 --> 17:02.906
<i>I've just completely
ruined the mold</i>

17:02.942 --> 17:04.775
and I have to sculpt it
all over again.

17:04.810 --> 17:06.242
I'm not gonna take it apart.

17:06.278 --> 17:08.912
<i>All ready we're set back,
so I don't know</i>

17:08.948 --> 17:11.013
<i>how we're going to come back
from this.</i>

17:11.050 --> 17:14.184
I'm about to give up because
I have no fight left in me.

17:18.584 --> 17:20.718
Ooh, it did not set.
Fuck.

17:20.752 --> 17:22.819
<i>I tried to open my mold
too early</i>

17:22.855 --> 17:25.222
and it's all mushy
on the inside,

17:25.257 --> 17:27.624
<i>so I completely ruined
the sculpt and the mold.</i>

17:27.660 --> 17:29.126
That's really
what just happened.

17:29.161 --> 17:30.861
I'm gonna have to re-mold it.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.062
Let's just take it back inside.

17:32.098 --> 17:33.564
It's not gonna happen.

17:33.599 --> 17:38.235
And now I have to sculpt these
little nubs all over again.

17:38.270 --> 17:39.436
<i>I'm going to be molding</i>

17:39.472 --> 17:41.939
<i>and running pieces
on application day.</i>

17:41.974 --> 17:44.174
That really sucks.

17:44.210 --> 17:45.709
Gonna re-sculpt these.

17:57.256 --> 17:58.655
When you get in here,
it might look cool, like,

17:58.691 --> 17:59.857
when you start curving it.

17:59.892 --> 18:02.025
Okay, then I'll just...
I'll put this down

18:02.061 --> 18:03.861
and then I'll start
putting more here.

18:03.896 --> 18:06.163
Cat told me I should cover
the whole thing in feathers

18:06.198 --> 18:09.299
I'll put a little bit more here
and see how I am on time and...

18:09.335 --> 18:10.334
and keep going.

18:10.369 --> 18:11.402
Okay.

18:11.437 --> 18:12.870
I got almost, like,
ten-feet long wings.

18:12.905 --> 18:15.973
<i>I'm getting a little worried
if I should be spending</i>

18:16.008 --> 18:18.776
that much time on these wings,
but I really trust

18:18.811 --> 18:20.711
whatever Cat wants to do
for this makeup.

18:20.746 --> 18:22.346
Wings are gonna
look awesome, baby.

18:22.381 --> 18:23.347
You're crazy, Cat.

18:29.188 --> 18:30.387
<i>While George is molding,</i>

18:30.423 --> 18:32.122
<i>I'm gonna start fabricating
the headpiece.</i>

18:32.158 --> 18:33.557
<i>I grab some L200...</i>

18:34.860 --> 18:37.428
Cut different circles.

18:37.463 --> 18:39.129
I'm gonna use hot give
to give the illusion

18:39.165 --> 18:40.864
that it's those little
lead strips

18:40.900 --> 18:43.767
between the glass panes
and paint vacuform plastic

18:43.803 --> 18:46.336
<i>so it looks like an actual
stained glass window.</i>

18:46.372 --> 18:49.506
I really want this headpiece
to bring a lot of attention

18:49.542 --> 18:52.342
to the face,
so I essentially want her face

18:52.378 --> 18:54.044
<i>to be at the center
of creativity.</i>

19:00.453 --> 19:01.985
When this is on her,
like, completely,

19:02.021 --> 19:03.487
then we can drip
everything out of it.

19:03.522 --> 19:04.455
Yeah.

19:04.490 --> 19:05.989
<i>We're feeling pretty good.</i>

19:06.025 --> 19:09.560
<i>We got all of our pieces done,
and we're just focusing on</i>

19:09.595 --> 19:13.997
pre-painting because this paint
job requires a lot of layers.

19:14.033 --> 19:17.367
The back piece already
looks like a bronze sculpture.

19:17.403 --> 19:18.969
That's cool.
I like that a lot.

19:26.912 --> 19:28.278
All right, guys, that's time!

19:28.314 --> 19:29.947
- Dude.
- Good job.

19:29.982 --> 19:31.048
Team Merewolf.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.683
Yeah!

19:44.697 --> 19:45.696
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

19:46.765 --> 19:47.564
Whoo!

19:50.236 --> 19:51.902
- That does look pretty good.
- Yeah.

19:51.937 --> 19:53.570
Ooh, the foam's nice...
the edges.

19:53.606 --> 19:54.771
Yeah.

19:54.807 --> 19:57.307
We can make it work
with the makeup.

19:57.343 --> 19:59.576
Everything looks great,
so we just really got to get

19:59.612 --> 20:01.712
<i>these little wing nubs
molded right away.</i>

20:01.747 --> 20:05.282
Jasmine takes them to mold
in silicone and then I start

20:05.317 --> 20:07.117
patching and seaming that cowl.

20:07.152 --> 20:09.419
Once the silicon modes
have cured all the way,

20:09.455 --> 20:13.123
I pop out the clay and then
I pour poly foam into them.

20:13.158 --> 20:15.692
<i>There's a lot to do,
but hopefully...</i>

20:15.728 --> 20:18.595
fingers crossed...
this thing works out.

20:22.868 --> 20:24.101
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

20:24.136 --> 20:25.235
Hello, hello.

20:25.271 --> 20:26.336
- How's it going, man?
- Great, man.

20:28.974 --> 20:31.008
I don't know.
This does feel kind of floppy.

20:31.043 --> 20:33.410
The halo has a wire
to keep it stable,

20:33.445 --> 20:35.512
<i>but it's a lot heavier
than I thought,</i>

20:35.548 --> 20:37.347
so this is not gonna work.

20:37.383 --> 20:38.982
But if you need me
to fabricate something quick,

20:39.018 --> 20:40.050
I can do that too.

20:40.085 --> 20:42.219
So Melissa goes
back into the mold room

20:42.254 --> 20:43.887
and starts to fabricate a halo

20:43.923 --> 20:45.689
<i>while I apply the face base.</i>

20:45.724 --> 20:48.191
<i>I'm a perfectionist,
and immunity or not,</i>

20:48.227 --> 20:50.394
I want a good makeup
out on that reveal stage.

20:50.429 --> 20:51.895
Our halo didn't work.

20:51.931 --> 20:52.796
Oh.

20:59.638 --> 21:01.505
Wow, that does line up
freaking amazing.

21:02.708 --> 21:04.908
<i>We get the devil face
and the arms glued on</i>

21:04.944 --> 21:07.444
<i>and it actually fits
almost perfectly.</i>

21:07.479 --> 21:10.314
All the proportions work out
very nicely

21:10.349 --> 21:11.882
and the edges look great.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.050
I'm so stoked.

21:13.085 --> 21:14.418
<i>Evan and I are really
happy about the way</i>

21:14.453 --> 21:15.953
this makeup is coming together.

21:15.988 --> 21:17.621
Oh, it's so cool.

21:24.563 --> 21:25.896
There you go.

21:25.931 --> 21:27.197
I think that'll really hold now.

21:27.232 --> 21:28.198
We get the pieces down.

21:28.233 --> 21:29.466
Things look nice.

21:29.501 --> 21:32.235
The profile looks cool,
so now it's time to paint.

21:32.271 --> 21:35.706
The only problem is I can't
really paint the devil

21:35.741 --> 21:37.908
until the angel's painted
because it involves

21:37.943 --> 21:39.710
<i>a lot of spattering
and over-spraying,</i>

21:39.745 --> 21:42.946
<i>so the longer it takes
to paint the angel,</i>

21:42.982 --> 21:44.414
the longer it takes
to get to the devil,

21:44.450 --> 21:47.985
<i>and that really is
the centerpiece of the makeup.</i>

21:53.125 --> 21:56.360
Hey, Rach, tell me
what you think of this.

21:56.395 --> 21:59.363
The finger section
on our back piece

21:59.398 --> 22:02.566
is pretty messed up,
so I take the finger blenders

22:02.601 --> 22:07.070
<i>that I made the first day
and use those over the back.</i>

22:07.106 --> 22:10.507
<i>We are not happy about
doing this on application day,</i>

22:10.542 --> 22:11.908
but it's all we have,

22:11.944 --> 22:13.844
and we just got to keep
moving forward.

22:13.879 --> 22:15.912
Oh, it's so much better.

22:19.652 --> 22:20.851
<i>What do you think
about this, Cat?</i>

22:20.886 --> 22:21.785
<i>You like that?</i>

22:21.820 --> 22:23.587
<i>Beautiful.
Yeah, beautiful.</i>

22:23.622 --> 22:26.957
While Niko starts going in
with all these grays and blacks,

22:26.992 --> 22:29.660
<i>I'm gonna do classical bridal
makeup on the other side.</i>

22:29.695 --> 22:32.329
I'd like the finish
with all the modeling.

22:32.364 --> 22:34.531
<i>We really don't want
the makeup to look like</i>

22:34.566 --> 22:36.533
it's just split exactly,
perfectly down the middle,

22:36.568 --> 22:38.535
<i>so Niko's making sure
to bring some color</i>

22:38.570 --> 22:40.570
<i>over on the beautiful angel
side,</i>

22:40.606 --> 22:43.273
so we have this nice
zigzag line going down.

22:43.308 --> 22:44.808
I think it's looking great.

22:46.412 --> 22:47.544
15 minutes!

22:54.987 --> 22:56.720
All right, everybody,
that's time!

22:59.291 --> 23:01.892
<i>Right now it looks like
a face stuck on.</i>

23:01.927 --> 23:05.162
I'm worried that our concept
might be difficult to justify

23:05.197 --> 23:06.797
<i>exactly what is going on.</i>

23:06.832 --> 23:08.432
<i>It's both abstract and literal,</i>

23:08.467 --> 23:11.234
<i>and if the judges
think that's confusing,</i>

23:11.270 --> 23:12.135
it could be a problem.

23:19.946 --> 23:21.045
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

23:23.416 --> 23:24.782
Contacts.
Just one side.

23:24.817 --> 23:26.851
We still have a lot to do
in Last Looks.

23:26.886 --> 23:28.986
<i>I want to finish
all the detail that we have</i>

23:29.021 --> 23:31.522
so we can really sell
that devil character.

23:34.961 --> 23:36.260
<i>I'm working on the back.</i>

23:36.295 --> 23:40.598
Rachael has based him out
in a vibrant red and purple,

23:40.633 --> 23:43.667
but I think it's a little bit
too vibrant, so I tone it down.

23:43.703 --> 23:45.069
We have to darken it up.

23:45.104 --> 23:45.936
And it's looking great.

23:49.242 --> 23:50.241
- You okay?
- Yeah.

23:50.276 --> 23:51.509
<i>We have a lot of painting to do,</i>

23:51.544 --> 23:52.943
but there's still
some costume elements

23:52.979 --> 23:55.346
that also need to be completed,
including applying the cape,

23:55.381 --> 23:58.282
<i>attaching feathers to the back,
finishing his loincloth,</i>

23:58.317 --> 23:59.984
<i>and making sure
the wig looks good.</i>

24:00.019 --> 24:00.851
Ten minutes!

24:10.463 --> 24:12.263
That's time, everybody!

24:12.298 --> 24:14.031
Don't leave me hanging.

24:14.066 --> 24:15.432
I'm so excited.

24:15.468 --> 24:18.702
Time is up, and I know
Stella and I are in trouble.

24:18.738 --> 24:20.371
I don't see a devil.

24:20.406 --> 24:21.772
I don't see an angel.

24:21.807 --> 24:23.407
<i>I'm not happy.</i>

24:33.452 --> 24:36.620
Welcome to the Face Off
reveal stage.

24:36.656 --> 24:39.290
Say hello
to our incredible judges...

24:39.325 --> 24:42.126
owner of Alchemy Studios,
Glenn Hetrick.

24:42.161 --> 24:43.127
Good evening.

24:43.162 --> 24:44.461
All: Hi.

24:44.497 --> 24:47.531
Oscar and Emmy-award winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

24:47.567 --> 24:49.466
- Hi, guys.
all: - Hi, Ve.

24:49.502 --> 24:52.102
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

24:52.138 --> 24:53.070
Hello.

24:53.105 --> 24:54.305
All: Hi, Neville.

24:54.340 --> 24:56.473
All right, guys,
let's just get right to it.

24:56.509 --> 24:59.443
For your Spotlight Challenge,
we asked you to create

24:59.478 --> 25:01.478
both an angel and a devil makeup

25:01.514 --> 25:04.848
inspired by two
of your own personality traits,

25:04.884 --> 25:07.084
and in an added twist,

25:07.119 --> 25:11.622
we asked that you apply
both makeups to one model.

25:11.657 --> 25:14.792
All right, let's take a look
at your creations.

25:35.214 --> 25:37.681
<i>We're really nervous,
but I can't believe</i>

25:37.717 --> 25:38.882
<i>that we pulled it together.</i>

25:38.918 --> 25:40.217
Maybe we will be safe.

25:40.253 --> 25:41.185
I don't know.

25:58.204 --> 26:00.571
<i>It reads from every direction.</i>

26:00.606 --> 26:03.007
We're really happy with it
and it looks really cool.

26:18.524 --> 26:19.490
<i>She looks awesome.</i>

26:19.525 --> 26:21.458
<i>From design to execution,</i>

26:21.494 --> 26:23.193
Cig and I are so happy
with this.

26:42.181 --> 26:44.214
<i>It's exactly
what Tyler and I wanted.</i>

26:44.250 --> 26:46.216
It is a makeup
that we're both proud of.

27:04.737 --> 27:06.670
<i>The paint job is almost
where I want it.</i>

27:06.706 --> 27:08.605
<i>Hopefully it will be clear
to the judges</i>

27:08.641 --> 27:11.141
that we've done a good job
of executing the positive

27:11.177 --> 27:12.042
and negative traits.

27:29.962 --> 27:32.329
<i>It is very different
than the rest of the makeups,</i>

27:32.365 --> 27:33.764
hopefully in a good way.

27:51.317 --> 27:54.184
<i>Rachael and I are both really
unsure about this makeup.</i>

27:54.220 --> 27:55.686
<i>There's more devil here
than angel,</i>

27:55.721 --> 27:57.554
and I'm not sure whether
we're gonna be in top,

27:57.590 --> 27:58.422
bottom, or safe.

28:16.375 --> 28:17.808
<i>She has a great silhouette.</i>

28:17.843 --> 28:19.209
<i>The wings are huge.</i>

28:19.245 --> 28:21.345
<i>They take almost half the stage.</i>

28:21.380 --> 28:22.813
I think it just looks awesome.

28:26.619 --> 28:28.752
Okay, judges,
why don't you take a closer look

28:28.788 --> 28:29.987
at tonight's makeups.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.127
I really wish they
would've been more mindful

28:37.163 --> 28:38.996
of his anatomy.

28:39.031 --> 28:41.098
The forms don't integrate
to his body at all.

28:41.133 --> 28:44.735
It doesn't make sense
for the angel/demon thing.

28:44.770 --> 28:46.437
And the horns resemble slugs.

28:46.472 --> 28:48.305
I don't get that at all.

28:50.443 --> 28:51.442
Oh, this is cool.

28:51.477 --> 28:53.143
There's a whole demon face here.

28:53.179 --> 28:55.045
I didn't even see it
until we got up close.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.346
One thing about it though.

28:56.382 --> 28:59.116
This little detail coming off
the side, it looks like

28:59.151 --> 29:02.486
cathedral stained glass,
but it feels Native American

29:02.521 --> 29:04.421
with the wings sticking
off the side of the circle.

29:06.258 --> 29:08.325
This is so beautiful.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.860
The color is fantastic.

29:09.895 --> 29:10.994
Yeah.

29:11.030 --> 29:13.564
The shapes coming
off of the head thrill me.

29:15.334 --> 29:16.400
I don't know, man.

29:16.435 --> 29:17.668
It doesn't make sense to me.

29:17.703 --> 29:20.037
The angle of this
is so jammed on.

29:20.072 --> 29:22.072
There had to be a better way
to position that

29:22.107 --> 29:24.074
to get it to flow into his form.

29:25.744 --> 29:29.379
I do love
this back piece though.

29:29.415 --> 29:31.849
I think that is quite fabulous.

29:31.884 --> 29:34.284
I think that this paint
is not good.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.920
I think it got way too muddy,
which is unfortunate.

29:38.757 --> 29:40.224
Even better close up.

29:40.259 --> 29:44.261
The level of detail
on this facial makeup alone

29:44.296 --> 29:46.129
is enough to make me love it.

29:46.165 --> 29:48.765
And it's a really beautiful
beauty makeup as well.

29:54.306 --> 29:56.907
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

29:56.942 --> 29:59.409
so let's find out
what they thought.

29:59.445 --> 30:01.645
Emily and Tyler.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.047
Logan and Adam.

30:04.083 --> 30:06.183
Ben and Evan.

30:06.218 --> 30:08.285
Cat and Niko.

30:08.320 --> 30:11.622
Stella and Jasmine.

30:11.657 --> 30:13.423
You are the best and the worst,

30:13.459 --> 30:15.392
and the judges would like
to speak with you

30:15.427 --> 30:17.227
before making their decisions.

30:17.263 --> 30:19.496
That means the rest of you can
head back to the makeup room.

30:19.532 --> 30:21.846
Thanks, you guys.
Good luck, everybody.

30:23.012 --> 30:24.483
Good luck.

30:28.507 --> 30:31.174
Ben and Evan, please step up.

30:31.210 --> 30:33.944
<i>Evan and I were in
bottom looks last challenge,</i>

30:33.979 --> 30:36.647
<i>and I know
if we're in the bottom again,</i>

30:36.682 --> 30:39.616
we're gonna be sent home.

30:44.337 --> 30:45.903
Ben and Evan, please step up.

30:53.613 --> 30:54.545
Hi, guys.

30:54.581 --> 30:55.947
Tell me about the concept

30:55.982 --> 30:58.549
and how you tried to represent
your traits in this makeup.

30:58.585 --> 31:02.487
Our angel represents
unconditional peace and giving,

31:02.522 --> 31:05.657
and our devil represents
taking advantage of kindness

31:05.692 --> 31:07.492
and mistaking it for weakness.

31:07.527 --> 31:10.762
I think it's artistically
beautiful.

31:10.797 --> 31:14.065
You hearken back to
the golden age of makeup effects

31:14.100 --> 31:16.000
with the way
that you handled the devil.

31:16.036 --> 31:18.870
I love the stretchy face,
and the horn is quite brilliant,

31:18.905 --> 31:20.405
the angle, the size.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.439
Nice sculpting in there, guys.

31:21.474 --> 31:22.740
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks so much.

31:22.776 --> 31:24.642
I think your angel
is quite exquisite.

31:24.678 --> 31:26.644
You've got this beautiful,
luminescent face,

31:26.680 --> 31:28.746
and then she turns sideways
and you've got this

31:28.782 --> 31:30.381
hideous creature coming out.

31:30.417 --> 31:32.116
Everything is so
well thought out.

31:32.152 --> 31:33.851
- You did a great job.
- Thank you.

31:33.887 --> 31:35.853
There's so much
that you've addressed,

31:35.889 --> 31:37.522
and you didn't make it overt,

31:37.557 --> 31:40.491
which is in stark contrast
to last week.

31:41.728 --> 31:43.328
Ben and Evan,
thank you very much.

31:43.363 --> 31:44.362
If you'd please step back.

31:44.397 --> 31:45.730
Thanks.

31:45.765 --> 31:46.597
Thank you.

31:51.404 --> 31:53.271
Logan and Adam,
please come forward.

32:00.180 --> 32:01.946
- Good evening.
both: - Hi.

32:01.981 --> 32:03.014
Tell us about your concept.

32:03.049 --> 32:05.516
Our angel/devil makeup
is an archangel

32:05.552 --> 32:08.720
who is giving into his primal,
lustful urges.

32:08.755 --> 32:11.723
He feels less of an angel
and severs his own wings off.

32:11.758 --> 32:14.225
So this is the devil creature
coming out?

32:14.260 --> 32:16.294
- This is the devil, yes.
- Climbing up.

32:16.329 --> 32:17.428
Okay.

32:17.464 --> 32:19.931
This is really not
a very successful makeup.

32:21.201 --> 32:23.568
All of his coloring
is very muddy.

32:23.603 --> 32:25.837
This skin on his body
is a yellowish gray

32:25.872 --> 32:28.005
and his face is almost
completely gray.

32:28.041 --> 32:30.141
I'm sorry, I just...
I just don't get this makeup.

32:31.978 --> 32:33.177
You guys can really sculpt.

32:33.213 --> 32:36.481
You have interesting ideas,
but it feels ridiculous

32:36.516 --> 32:37.982
in the head, the hair,

32:38.017 --> 32:39.984
and you should've seen that
yourselves.

32:41.554 --> 32:42.754
It doesn't really work

32:42.789 --> 32:45.423
to have that hand coming
out of the side of his chest.

32:45.458 --> 32:48.126
I like the concept
of the succubus,

32:48.161 --> 32:50.962
it's just the way that you
fit it onto his body

32:50.997 --> 32:51.963
that's so troublesome.

32:53.533 --> 32:54.732
Logan and Adam,

32:54.768 --> 32:56.134
if you'd please head back.

32:56.169 --> 32:57.034
Thanks.

33:02.909 --> 33:04.308
Let's talk to Emily and Tyler.

33:10.517 --> 33:12.183
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.

33:12.218 --> 33:13.351
Tell us about your concept.

33:13.386 --> 33:15.453
Our devil trait is guilt

33:15.488 --> 33:18.589
and our angel trait
is compassion.

33:18.625 --> 33:20.925
Guilt can eat away at you
and corrode you,

33:20.960 --> 33:23.561
and we wanted to translate that
into the design.

33:23.596 --> 33:28.699
This is an exquisite visage.

33:28.735 --> 33:33.037
The precision and the accuracy
of the erosion and the tarnish

33:33.072 --> 33:34.672
feels so authentic.

33:34.707 --> 33:36.207
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

33:36.242 --> 33:38.476
The shapes on top of the head,

33:38.511 --> 33:41.879
absolutely beautiful,
and they feel taken from

33:41.915 --> 33:45.983
religious architecture
without being too literal.

33:46.019 --> 33:47.285
Super impressive work, guys.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.453
Both: Thank you.

33:48.488 --> 33:51.956
This makeup is so gorgeous
and so beautifully done.

33:51.991 --> 33:55.426
The sculpture on her back that
you've placed that wing into,

33:55.462 --> 33:56.761
you handled that so well.

33:56.796 --> 33:58.162
Thank you very much.

33:58.198 --> 33:59.263
Emily and Tyler,

33:59.299 --> 34:00.298
you can step back.

34:00.333 --> 34:01.199
Thank you.

34:07.407 --> 34:09.540
Stella and Jasmine,
please step up.

34:13.480 --> 34:16.214
Go over your conceptualization
process for me, if you will.

34:16.248 --> 34:18.014
We both agreed on stubbornness

34:18.051 --> 34:20.384
and we both agreed on
an open heart.

34:20.420 --> 34:23.821
The angel is within him
and battling with his head

34:23.857 --> 34:25.690
and saying, "I want to escape."

34:25.725 --> 34:28.059
I feel like you haven't managed

34:28.094 --> 34:29.627
to complete your own concept.

34:31.797 --> 34:34.331
Sculptures are soft and round

34:34.367 --> 34:36.067
and the forms are meandering,

34:36.101 --> 34:37.735
and that confuses me.

34:37.770 --> 34:41.339
This doesn't feel angelic
nor devilish, really.

34:41.373 --> 34:42.773
It's sort of a creature.

34:44.444 --> 34:47.545
I feel like the chest
is not an organic piece at all.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.114
It's nothing that says that
that is his heart.

34:50.149 --> 34:52.216
It's just an appliqué
stuck on there.

34:52.252 --> 34:54.385
Also, the paint job
is very muddy.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.755
It's just all over the place
and very disconnected.

34:57.790 --> 35:00.658
One thing I really do like
about this is your palette,

35:00.693 --> 35:04.896
but it's not enough
to elevate this in any way.

35:04.931 --> 35:06.664
Thank you.

35:06.699 --> 35:10.167
Stella and Jasmine,
you can head back.

35:17.210 --> 35:18.910
Cat and Niko,
please come forward.

35:28.087 --> 35:29.086
Hi, Cat and Niko.

35:29.122 --> 35:30.221
Both: Hi.

35:30.256 --> 35:32.189
Can you please tell us
how you used your traits

35:32.225 --> 35:33.558
in conjunction with your makeup?

35:33.593 --> 35:35.493
So the traits
that we decided to choose

35:35.528 --> 35:38.095
are loyalty
to represent our angel

35:38.131 --> 35:40.331
and jealousy
to represent our devil.

35:40.366 --> 35:41.599
She's overcome with jealousy

35:41.634 --> 35:43.067
and it's turning her
into this devil

35:43.102 --> 35:44.101
from the inside out.

35:44.137 --> 35:45.403
It's just rotting her away.

35:45.438 --> 35:46.771
I think it's awesome.

35:46.806 --> 35:47.605
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

35:47.640 --> 35:48.673
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:48.708 --> 35:50.508
Your wings are, like,
stupendous,

35:50.543 --> 35:53.444
and this is probably
the most beautiful beauty makeup

35:53.479 --> 35:54.712
we've had on this show.

35:54.747 --> 35:55.947
Very nice job, you guys.

35:55.982 --> 35:57.448
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

35:57.483 --> 36:03.220
Big, profoundly strong
in regard to its silhouette,

36:03.256 --> 36:06.290
and defying the laws of physics.

36:06.326 --> 36:07.391
I'm referring to your hair.

36:10.063 --> 36:11.896
How the hell do you do it, man?

36:14.334 --> 36:15.600
You can say, "All right,

36:15.635 --> 36:17.868
I'm gonna do this
incredibly large silhouette,"

36:17.904 --> 36:20.605
and that could so easily
not have worked,

36:20.640 --> 36:22.840
so congratulations
on pulling it off.

36:22.875 --> 36:24.141
Both: Thank you so much.

36:24.177 --> 36:25.977
Cat and Niko, please step back.

36:26.012 --> 36:27.478
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

36:27.513 --> 36:28.379
Thank you.

36:32.285 --> 36:34.085
Okay, if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

36:34.120 --> 36:35.720
while the judges deliberate.

36:35.755 --> 36:36.654
All: Thank you.

36:36.689 --> 36:37.588
Thank you so much.

36:41.027 --> 36:42.493
All right, judges,
why don't we talk about

36:42.528 --> 36:44.862
the looks that
you liked the most this week.

36:44.897 --> 36:46.998
Let's start with Ben and Evan.

36:47.033 --> 36:48.432
<i>They really did such a great job</i>

36:48.468 --> 36:50.001
<i>this week compared to last week.</i>

36:50.036 --> 36:51.469
<i>This is really a cool makeup.</i>

36:51.504 --> 36:54.305
The flow of the horn
from the tip

36:54.340 --> 36:57.541
<i>all the way down the body
was really quite beautiful.</i>

36:57.577 --> 37:00.111
Love the devil face,
and I especially love it

37:00.146 --> 37:03.381
when she brings her arm over
and you have the framing

37:03.416 --> 37:06.584
<i>of that face and the way it
comes off of the good side.</i>

37:06.619 --> 37:09.353
All right, let's move on
to Emily and Tyler.

37:09.389 --> 37:11.856
<i>It was lacking
in the recognition</i>

37:11.891 --> 37:13.357
<i>of the angel and devil.</i>

37:13.393 --> 37:16.427
<i>That being said,
the makeup was so gorgeous.</i>

37:16.462 --> 37:21.399
The way they managed to convey
the erosion was so good.

37:21.434 --> 37:24.235
<i>And that fallen wing
and the S shapes to it,</i>

37:24.270 --> 37:26.904
<i>I thought that it was
integrated into Nayeli's form</i>

37:26.939 --> 37:28.406
<i>perfectly.</i>

37:28.441 --> 37:31.275
All right, let's move on
to Cat and Niko.

37:31.310 --> 37:33.277
<i>Well, they did a great job
this week too,</i>

37:33.312 --> 37:34.812
<i>and you saw the character traits</i>

37:34.847 --> 37:36.480
<i>that they were trying
to portray.</i>

37:36.516 --> 37:39.984
The short hand version of
their wings still conveyed

37:40.019 --> 37:43.020
<i>an anatomically-correct-looking
wing.</i>

37:43.056 --> 37:45.056
That is very difficult
to pull off.

37:45.091 --> 37:46.524
The amount of detail

37:46.559 --> 37:50.327
<i>and accuracy that went into
the veining, beautifully done.</i>

37:50.663 --> 37:53.063
All right, judges,
let's move on to the makeups

37:53.099 --> 37:54.798
that weren't so successful.

37:54.834 --> 37:57.801
Let's talk about
Stella and Jasmine.

37:57.837 --> 38:01.138
<i>No matter what, you've got
to make it beautiful,</i>

38:01.173 --> 38:03.640
<i>and they've not done that
for the past two weeks.</i>

38:03.676 --> 38:06.610
The fact that
they had two lighting features

38:06.645 --> 38:10.614
that were completely buried
is such a poor use of time.

38:10.649 --> 38:12.583
In terms of the angelic side,

38:12.618 --> 38:15.419
<i>it was just odd,
asymmetrical filigree</i>

38:15.454 --> 38:16.520
<i>with a heart in the middle.</i>

38:16.555 --> 38:18.288
His horns look like slugs.

38:18.324 --> 38:20.758
<i>There was nothing masculine
or frightening</i>

38:20.793 --> 38:21.658
<i>or devilish about it.</i>

38:21.694 --> 38:24.528
And finally, Adam and Logan.

38:24.563 --> 38:28.165
<i>Last week, the top
of the thing was amazing.</i>

38:28.200 --> 38:30.067
But the concepts
aren't clicking.

38:30.102 --> 38:32.436
<i>The choice of putting
that wig on that character</i>

38:32.471 --> 38:33.570
<i>was frightening.</i>

38:33.606 --> 38:35.305
That whole makeup
was disproportionate.

38:35.341 --> 38:36.707
<i>The head looked like
it was just a block</i>

38:36.742 --> 38:39.710
<i>that was placed inside of a box
and stuck on the chest.</i>

38:39.745 --> 38:41.645
<i>The hands were too big
for the head.</i>

38:41.680 --> 38:42.946
I don't know what they were
going for there.

38:42.982 --> 38:45.115
All right, then, judges,
have you made up your minds?

38:46.385 --> 38:47.418
- We have.
- Yeah.

38:47.453 --> 38:50.020
Excellent.
Let's bring them back out.

38:53.059 --> 38:54.958
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top teams.

38:54.994 --> 38:58.162
Ben and Evan, you did some
beautiful sculpting.

38:58.197 --> 39:00.864
We loved the flow of the makeup
from the horn

39:00.900 --> 39:02.032
down into the body.

39:02.068 --> 39:03.767
Great comeback this week.

39:03.803 --> 39:07.171
Cat and Niko, there was some
exquisite paint work

39:07.206 --> 39:08.472
on your character,

39:08.507 --> 39:12.242
and those wings were just
unbelievably well constructed

39:12.278 --> 39:13.577
and realized.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.979
Okay, so who is
our winning team?

39:16.015 --> 39:17.214
Our winning team tonight is...

39:25.834 --> 39:27.901
All right, Glenn,
so who is our winning team?

39:27.936 --> 39:29.402
Our winning team tonight is...

39:34.109 --> 39:36.442
Cat and Niko.

39:39.414 --> 39:41.781
This makeup best captured
the spirit of this challenge

39:41.817 --> 39:44.417
and you guys made some
really smart decisions,

39:44.452 --> 39:46.853
how you portrayed
your personality traits

39:46.888 --> 39:48.254
within the character.

39:48.290 --> 39:49.956
- Thank you so much.
- Thank... thank you so much.

39:49.991 --> 39:50.857
We really appreciate it.

39:50.892 --> 39:51.925
- Yeah, we win.
- Yay.

39:51.960 --> 39:52.926
It's awesome.

39:52.961 --> 39:54.227
<i>I want to cry I'm so excited,</i>

39:54.262 --> 39:57.597
<i>especially since it had
so much of us in the makeup.</i>

39:57.632 --> 39:58.698
- It was all you.
- Good job, baby.

39:58.733 --> 40:00.133
- No, good job, you.
- It was your wings.

40:00.168 --> 40:01.467
No, you were...
you did a good job.

40:01.503 --> 40:03.303
Cat and Niko, congratulations.

40:03.338 --> 40:07.574
You, Ben and Evan,
Emily and Tyler are all safe

40:07.609 --> 40:09.108
and can head back
to the makeup room.

40:09.144 --> 40:10.043
All: Thank you.

40:16.285 --> 40:17.951
All right, guys,
that means the rest of you

40:17.986 --> 40:20.654
are on the bottom, and two of
you will be going home tonight.

40:23.659 --> 40:24.524
Please step forward.

40:34.870 --> 40:37.037
All right, Glenn, tell us about
the bottom teams.

40:37.072 --> 40:39.706
Logan and Adam,
while the sculpting

40:39.741 --> 40:42.542
definitely showed off
how talented both of you are,

40:42.578 --> 40:45.912
the makeup felt disconnected
in terms of design.

40:45.948 --> 40:47.581
Stella, Jasmine,

40:47.616 --> 40:49.616
there were some beautiful
elements to your makeup,

40:49.651 --> 40:52.686
but the fact that you were
struggling conceptually

40:52.721 --> 40:54.054
was really apparent.

40:54.089 --> 40:55.855
So which team
is going home tonight?

40:55.891 --> 40:57.257
The team
going home tonight is...

41:02.264 --> 41:03.496
Stella and Jasmine.

41:04.833 --> 41:07.133
Between the confused character
that you presented

41:07.169 --> 41:09.135
and the fact that it was
the second week on the bottom,

41:09.171 --> 41:10.136
it was really hard for us

41:10.172 --> 41:11.805
to justify
sending anyone else home.

41:13.408 --> 41:17.777
Stella and Jasmine, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

41:17.813 --> 41:19.746
That means Adam and Logan,
you are safe this week

41:19.781 --> 41:21.247
and can head back
to the makeup room.

41:21.283 --> 41:22.282
Thank you.

41:22.317 --> 41:23.149
Thank you.

41:29.057 --> 41:30.423
Come here, you.

41:30.459 --> 41:32.792
Judges, anything you'd like to
say to Stella and Jasmine?

41:32.828 --> 41:34.127
I would, please.

41:34.162 --> 41:37.163
There's plenty of positive
that we've experienced

41:37.199 --> 41:39.933
and seen you do, so make sure
that that's what you take away

41:39.968 --> 41:43.603
and continue doing
what you're so good at.

41:43.639 --> 41:44.604
We'll miss you.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.739
Thank you so much.

41:45.774 --> 41:48.008
Stella and Jasmine,
it's been so great

41:48.043 --> 41:49.342
having you with us again.

41:49.378 --> 41:51.144
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

41:51.179 --> 41:52.212
and pack up your kits.

41:54.683 --> 41:55.849
We're the first to go home.

41:55.884 --> 41:57.183
I know, and it's a little
embarrassing.

41:57.219 --> 41:58.318
Well, we're an all-star.

41:58.353 --> 41:59.319
That's true.

42:01.790 --> 42:02.989
Stella and Jasmine.

42:03.025 --> 42:04.557
All: Oh.

42:04.593 --> 42:05.992
Sorry, guys.

42:06.028 --> 42:09.362
I'd love to stay longer,
but it feels so good

42:09.398 --> 42:11.464
to have competed
with these guys.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.500
I'm just so honored to be here.

42:13.535 --> 42:14.501
It's getting dusty.

42:16.805 --> 42:19.239
I'll never be less hard
on myself.

42:19.274 --> 42:21.207
<i>I'm still gonna be
a makeup artist.</i>

42:21.243 --> 42:22.275
<i>That's my life.</i>

42:24.012 --> 42:26.212
<i>I think we did a lot
of really beautiful work,</i>

42:26.248 --> 42:28.181
and I'm so proud.

42:32.487 --> 42:33.920
Love you.

42:33.955 --> 42:34.954
Mean it.
