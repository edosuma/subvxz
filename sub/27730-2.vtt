WEBVTT

00:08.312 --> 00:10.358
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:10.401 --> 00:11.707
Captain Christopher Pike

00:11.750 --> 00:13.404
requests permission
to come aboard.

00:13.448 --> 00:14.927
I'm here at Starfleet's order to
take command of the Discovery.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.538
Over the past 24 hours,

00:16.581 --> 00:18.061
Federation sensors
picked up

00:18.105 --> 00:19.541
seven red bursts spread out

00:19.584 --> 00:21.195
across more than
30,000 light-years.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.066
And right now this little dot

00:23.110 --> 00:25.677
is the only one willing to
tell us where it is. Hit it.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.550
Pike toDiscovery.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.117
Get us out of here.Wait!

00:31.944 --> 00:34.077
TILLY: I need a sample
of that asteroid.

00:35.426 --> 00:36.949
we'll be able to interact
with dark matter, sir.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.429
The asteroid has been shedding
rocks all over the place.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.779
We still have time
to reach one of them.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.825
It's in the bay.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.783
SARU: What's your status?The shuttle bay
needs a little TLC,

00:44.827 --> 00:46.568
but all is well, Commander.

00:46.611 --> 00:47.830
I saw you die.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.832
I watched Tyler kill you.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.921
I held your body in my arms.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.228
I believe in you,
Paul. I love you.

00:54.271 --> 00:55.751
I'd like to go
to Enterprise,sir.

00:55.794 --> 00:56.795
I'm sorry, Burnham,

00:56.839 --> 00:58.362
but Spock's not there.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.930
A few months ago
I felt something shift in him.

01:00.973 --> 01:03.280
It's as if he'd run into
a question he couldn't answer.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.239
He asked me for time,
and I gave it to him.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.242
Spock.

01:15.205 --> 01:19.253
SPOCK: As a child, I had what
my mother called "nightmares."

01:19.296 --> 01:22.256
She taught me to control
my fear by drawing them,

01:22.299 --> 01:24.475
rendering fear powerless.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.564
The nightmares have returned.

01:26.608 --> 01:29.698
The same vision,
again and again.

01:29.741 --> 01:33.136
I now understand its meaning
and where it must lead me.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.573
I have encoded it
within this audio file

01:35.617 --> 01:37.575
in the event of my death.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.839
This may be my last entry
aboard the Enterprise.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.977
Spock has had this tablet
since he was a boy.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.153
I took it from his quarters.

01:50.197 --> 01:53.591
He drew these signals two months
before they appeared to us.

01:53.635 --> 01:56.420
Computer, show me Starfleet's
rendering of the seven signals.

01:57.595 --> 02:00.337
Rotate 90 degrees
counterclockwise.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.947
It's damn near identical.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.080
There any more sketches
like this one?No.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.387
Sir, my brother

02:06.430 --> 02:08.301
sounds deeply troubled.

02:08.345 --> 02:11.305
I know he's on leave, but
we need to contact him,

02:11.348 --> 02:13.481
find out what he knows
about these signals.

02:13.524 --> 02:16.701
I know where Spock is, Burnham.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.140
Have a seat.

02:25.884 --> 02:28.322
Your brother...

02:28.365 --> 02:31.368
is in the psychiatric unit
on Starbase 5.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.633
Since about a week
after he took leave.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.158
Committed to the facility
at his own request.

02:38.201 --> 02:41.900
Why weren't my parents or I told

02:41.944 --> 02:43.902
about this request?

02:43.946 --> 02:47.210
It's Starfleet protocol
to reach out to the families...

02:47.254 --> 02:48.907
Unless the patient
doesn't want that,

02:48.951 --> 02:50.518
and Spock said no.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.389
Emphatically.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.696
With that said,

02:54.739 --> 02:57.220
his association
with these signals

02:57.264 --> 02:59.918
outweighs his desire
for absolute privacy.

02:59.962 --> 03:04.053
You could extend an olive branch
to your brother,

03:04.096 --> 03:06.490
but he'll need to decide
whether or not to take it.

03:06.534 --> 03:09.754
He won't.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.756
At least not from me.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.019
The way I left things
with my brother...

03:14.063 --> 03:18.459
We haven't spoken in years.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.375
Family dynamics
can be complicated.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.247
My father was a
science teacher,

03:24.291 --> 03:26.945
and when he wasn't doing that,
he taught comparative religion.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.296
It was a confusing
household, and...

03:29.339 --> 03:30.775
We didn't agree on a lot.

03:30.819 --> 03:35.389
Look, I've shared with
you everything I know.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.129
Trust you can do the same
with me.

03:37.173 --> 03:40.481
If there's ever anything
you feel you ought to tell me...

03:45.660 --> 03:48.576
Sir, when we were
on that asteroid...

03:54.451 --> 03:55.974
I...

03:58.020 --> 04:00.675
I never properly thanked you

04:00.718 --> 04:03.417
for coming back to get me.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.462
You're welcome.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.117
SARU: Captain Pike
to the bridge immediately.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.120
Captain on
the bridge.

04:11.163 --> 04:13.296
Ah, Captain. Another signal
has just appeared.

04:14.819 --> 04:17.605
BURNHAM: The transmission
is too faint to determine

04:17.648 --> 04:19.128
the exact coordinates.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.695
TILLY: Excuse me, Commander
Burnham. I was using

04:20.738 --> 04:22.087
your station to run
calibration modeling programs.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.741
Let me just close some
of this stuff out.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.614
Ensign Tilly had a notion

04:26.657 --> 04:27.963
to pinpoint the signals.

04:28.006 --> 04:28.964
I gave her permission to try it.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.270
Excellent.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.923
I'm modulating Discovery's
deflector dish.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.099
The idea is that we'll create
gravimetric distortion

04:34.143 --> 04:35.362
that will act like sonar.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.885
That's a good plan,

04:36.928 --> 04:38.278
but the signal's too
far away to register.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.802
If we were closer,

04:40.845 --> 04:43.065
we might be able to detect
gravitational redshift

04:43.108 --> 04:45.154
and use that to calculate
its exact position.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.112
I suggest we go to
warp momentarily,

04:47.156 --> 04:49.811
then target it with long-range
sensors as soon as we drop out.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.335
Detmer, take us to maximum warp
for five seconds.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.510
Aye, sir.

04:58.602 --> 04:59.603
Signal coordinates received.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.823
And it's in the Beta Quadrant,

05:01.866 --> 05:04.434
51,450 light-years away.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.610
PIKE: At top speed,
that would take us

05:06.654 --> 05:08.569
150 years to get that far.

05:08.612 --> 05:09.918
My unborn children's children

05:09.961 --> 05:11.354
would be lucky
to get there. Ideas?

05:11.398 --> 05:12.660
The spore drive.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.052
But until a nonhuman interface

05:14.096 --> 05:15.880
is found,
Starfleet has decommissioned it.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.752
Or its navigator, really.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.362
BURNHAM: In order to guide us
through the mycelial network,

05:19.406 --> 05:22.713
Commander Stamets injected
himself with Tardigrade DNA,

05:22.757 --> 05:25.063
a violation of Starfleet's ban

05:25.107 --> 05:26.369
on genetic manipulation.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.501
They were willing
to overlook this

05:27.544 --> 05:28.850
during the war, however.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.373
A Tardigrade?

05:30.417 --> 05:32.375
I suppose you had to be there.Getting to the bottom

05:32.419 --> 05:35.117
of these signals is of utmost
importance to the Federation.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.249
They let you use the drive
to fight the Klingons.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.860
They'll give us
dispensation now.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.253
How long before
it can be operational?

05:41.297 --> 05:43.734
Once I begin prepping
Commander Stamets, 20 minutes.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.693
Get to it.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.259
TILLY: Bet you're glad
you stayed on board, right?

05:47.303 --> 05:48.609
Hmm?

05:48.652 --> 05:50.524
Being back in the saddle.
You and me.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.396
Doing our thang.
I thought the jump

05:53.440 --> 05:56.921
to Qo'noS would be the last time
in a long time.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.102
What's wrong?

06:05.147 --> 06:07.932
I saw Hugh in the network.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.761
What? You mean, after he...
after he died?

06:10.805 --> 06:13.895
Yes. When I was
trapped there,

06:13.938 --> 06:15.897
he comforted me.

06:15.940 --> 06:19.422
He pushed me to escape
when I was ready to give up.

06:19.466 --> 06:23.034
He helped pilot Discoveryout
of the Terran universe, Tilly.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.035
He saved us all.

06:24.079 --> 06:27.952
I...I-I know how this sounds.

06:27.996 --> 06:32.174
At first, I told myself it was
a fabrication of my own mind

06:32.217 --> 06:35.003
culled from my memories
by the mycelia,

06:35.046 --> 06:38.702
but since then,
I'm not so sure.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.704
I didn't see him

06:40.748 --> 06:42.358
the last time I jumped,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.012
but knowing it's
a possibility...

06:44.055 --> 06:46.493
I would think that possibility
would make you happy.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.625
Astromycology has taught me

06:48.669 --> 06:51.541
that nothing is ever truly gone.

06:51.585 --> 06:54.501
Fungi are the
universe's recyclers.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.678
This is how termination
begets creation.

06:57.721 --> 07:00.158
It's why life is eternal.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.987
And my place is on this
side of that cycle.

07:03.031 --> 07:06.121
If I return to the network
and see him again...

07:06.164 --> 07:07.514
PIKE :
We good to go, Mr. Stamets?

07:14.521 --> 07:17.611
MALE : All personnel,
prepare for black alert.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.090
This is not a drill.

07:19.134 --> 07:21.136
Repeat, this is not a drill.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.444
Spore drive is on line.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.578
STAMETS:
Spore drive is ready, Captain.

07:28.622 --> 07:29.840
SARU:
Questions or concerns

07:29.884 --> 07:31.625
before we depart, Captain?

07:31.668 --> 07:33.627
If you're telling
me that this ship

07:33.670 --> 07:36.020
can skip across the universe
on a highway made of mushrooms,

07:36.064 --> 07:37.500
I kind of have
to go on faith.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.982
Be bold.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.113
Be brave.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.072
Be courageous. Black alert.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.642
MALE:
All personnel, black alert.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.170
Let's jump.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.799
You never forget
your first, sir.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.063
Ah.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.940
Commander Stamets...

08:25.983 --> 08:28.377
Not now, Tilly.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.293
There's no sign of the signal.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.599
Are we where
we're supposed to be?

08:32.642 --> 08:33.861
Affirmative.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.385
Report.Class-M planet.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.778
No power signatures
or starships

08:37.821 --> 08:39.082
in the area.

08:39.126 --> 08:40.607
No one scanning us
from the surface.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.479
Wait, I detect
human life signs.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.658
No humans have settled this
far out in the Beta Quadrant.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.008
Captain, I'm picking
up a transmission

08:51.052 --> 08:52.836
from the surface.Send it through, Bryce.

08:54.882 --> 08:58.407
MAN: We're under attack!
We're holed up inside.

08:58.450 --> 09:01.715
A few hundred souls:
men, women and children.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.934
Red alert.
Ready photon torpedoes.

09:03.978 --> 09:06.154
Are you sure there's
nobody else out there?We're alone, Captain.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.112
Pinpoint the distress call.
Show me where it's coming from.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.553
Enhance.

09:21.125 --> 09:24.564
They do not seem to be in any
sort of distress, Captain.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.914
Can you trace any
warp signatures

09:26.957 --> 09:28.568
or starships near the planet?

09:29.743 --> 09:32.223
Not a single one.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.444
I can, however, confirm that,

09:35.487 --> 09:37.751
based on audiophonic
degradation,

09:37.794 --> 09:42.190
the transmission has been
broadcasting on a loop for...

09:42.233 --> 09:44.366
200 years.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.716
That's before warp
was even invented.

09:48.326 --> 09:50.981
Somebody want to tell me
how they got here?

11:29.253 --> 11:32.039
The arrival of those people
on the planet directly coincides

11:32.082 --> 11:34.041
with World War III on Earth--

11:34.084 --> 11:36.217
a nuclear cataclysm that
left 600 million dead

11:36.260 --> 11:38.610
and governments destroyed.

11:38.654 --> 11:41.222
The broadcast frequency
from the surface is obsolete,

11:41.265 --> 11:42.571
too weak for interstellar
communication.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.268
It's all coming
from this structure here.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.661
It's a church, Burnham.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.576
Yes, sir.

11:47.619 --> 11:48.882
PIKE:
They're speaking

11:48.925 --> 11:50.579
Federation Standard.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.320
They had to have a starship
to get out this far.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.583
Hell, the only way we got here
was by using a spore drive.

11:54.626 --> 11:57.847
Yet with the roughly
11,000 people,

11:57.891 --> 12:00.067
spread over ten settlements
across the planet,

12:00.110 --> 12:01.851
there is no ship
or power signature to speak of.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.287
They don't even use electricity.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.072
Since their society

12:05.115 --> 12:07.248
is pre-warp, we have to assume
General Order 1 applies.

12:08.597 --> 12:09.903
Why did that

12:09.946 --> 12:12.819
second signal want us
to come here?

12:12.862 --> 12:15.343
As science officer,
I would advise restraint

12:15.386 --> 12:18.433
in ascribing motivation
to what are now simply

12:18.476 --> 12:20.783
unidentifiable energy bursts.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.655
"There are more things in heaven
and earth, Horatio..."

12:23.699 --> 12:25.701
I know my Shakespeare, Captain.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.486
Are you suggesting that
some kind of divine intervention

12:28.530 --> 12:30.271
put those people
on the planet?

12:30.314 --> 12:32.664
I assume you're familiar
with Clarke's Third Law?Yes.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.405
In the 20th century,
Arthur C. Clarke said that

12:34.449 --> 12:37.104
"Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable

12:37.147 --> 12:38.975
from magic."The law was debated

12:39.019 --> 12:40.803
by scientists
and theologians alike,

12:40.847 --> 12:42.370
and later reinterpreted to say:

12:42.413 --> 12:44.198
"Any sufficiently advanced

12:44.241 --> 12:49.116
extraterrestrial intelligence is
indistinguishable from God."

12:49.159 --> 12:51.205
I have no idea

12:51.248 --> 12:53.163
how or why they're here,

12:53.207 --> 12:56.079
but I highly doubt
it's by accident.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.647
Certainly a bold
interpretation, sir.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.823
What else do we know
about the planet?

13:00.867 --> 13:03.304
It is surprisingly Earth-like.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.306
However,

13:05.349 --> 13:07.264
the interweaving orbital rings

13:07.308 --> 13:10.224
are comprised of
radioactive debris.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.443
Quite unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

13:12.487 --> 13:15.272
Figuring out how these people
got there may shed some light

13:15.316 --> 13:17.100
on the nature
of the signals themselves.

13:17.144 --> 13:19.494
Who's best suited to come
with us to the surface, Burnham?

13:20.625 --> 13:22.932
Lieutenant Owosekun.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.979
She grew up in a Luddite
collective on Earth.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.590
She'll know how to embed,
per General Order 1.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.635
Brief her and let's move.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.072
COMPUTER:
Your personal shielding
is phase-locked

13:32.115 --> 13:33.856
with the gravity simulator.

13:33.900 --> 13:37.120
Any change in this gravimetric
stability will result in...

13:37.164 --> 13:38.513
Boom.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.558
Confirmed.

13:46.347 --> 13:49.785
As theorized, there are
periodic concentrations of

13:49.829 --> 13:51.308
metreon particles.

13:51.352 --> 13:54.877
Yeah. Here looks promising.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.836
Okeydokey.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.320
Activating laser core sampler

14:03.364 --> 14:06.846
and corresponding
internal artificial grav.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.587
And according
to my calculations,

14:09.631 --> 14:11.067
one cubic centimeter of

14:11.111 --> 14:12.895
metreon-charged asteroid
weighs in

14:12.939 --> 14:15.202
at a portly
one point five metric tons.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.474
Metreon fluctuation detected.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.302
Adjust grav sim.

14:28.345 --> 14:29.651
Project termination advised.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.000
Not yet.

14:31.044 --> 14:33.046
Metreon-charged dark matter
is our only lead

14:33.089 --> 14:34.656
in finding
a new spore-drive interface,

14:34.699 --> 14:36.266
and Commander Stamets
needs this.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.579
Got it.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.147
Secure sample.

14:58.071 --> 15:01.291
Hello, gorgeous.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.688
COMPUTER:
Alert. Energy discharge

15:06.731 --> 15:10.387
of unknown origin detected
in main shuttle bay. Engineer...

15:29.972 --> 15:31.974
No life signs inside.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.585
Set phasers to stun.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.936
Keep 'em handy
but out of sight.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.954
Have either of you ever been
in a church?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.346
OWOSEKUN:
No. My family are

15:56.390 --> 15:58.087
non-believers.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.263
I'm familiar with the
texts of Earth's religions.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.700
All right.
Let's find out

16:02.744 --> 16:05.312
who these people are and why
they're calling for help.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.753
This glass is two centuries old.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.496
It represents
not just Christianity, but

16:15.539 --> 16:20.196
Judaism, Islam, Hinduism,
Buddhism,

16:20.240 --> 16:23.112
Shinto and Wicca.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.636
The distress call is
coming from beneath us.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.943
I'll look for
the basement.

16:36.517 --> 16:39.999
"For those
who live the old way burn.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.522
"Those who

16:41.565 --> 16:45.134
sin against us shall be cut down
by our gods."

16:45.178 --> 16:47.658
That's light and welcoming.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.009
"When those who believe
in our signs come to thee,

16:50.052 --> 16:52.620
say, 'Peace be upon you.'"

16:53.882 --> 16:56.319
Anthropologically speaking,

16:56.363 --> 16:58.843
it appears that
they cobbled together a religion

16:58.887 --> 17:00.932
based on the primary faiths
of Earth.

17:00.976 --> 17:04.675
This book is some sort
of new scripture.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.026
It might be their historical
record. I'll scan the text.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.161
Or we could look
at the pictures.

17:12.204 --> 17:15.598
That was the original purpose
for a window like this.

17:15.643 --> 17:18.819
To teach the gospel
to those who couldn't read.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.615
Why aren't you in the fields?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.054
We're not from here.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.447
Uh, my name is Christopher.

17:37.491 --> 17:40.450
This is Michael and Joanne.

17:40.494 --> 17:43.366
Is this your first time
in New Eden?Yes.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.672
We're from the north.

17:44.715 --> 17:47.153
The All-Mother

17:47.196 --> 17:50.286
will want to see you.

17:50.330 --> 17:54.464
PEOPLE:
We welcome our new friends
from the northern territory

17:54.508 --> 17:57.815
and pledge gratitude
to our Creators

17:57.859 --> 18:00.731
for their love and deliverance
to New Eden

18:00.775 --> 18:03.778
on our planet Terralysium.

18:05.693 --> 18:09.044
Tonight, on the harvest moon,
we remember

18:09.088 --> 18:12.091
that over 200 years ago,
in 2053,

18:12.134 --> 18:16.921
the First Saved, soldiers
and civilians among them,

18:16.965 --> 18:19.402
took cover in the white church

18:19.446 --> 18:22.536
from the devastation
of World War III.

18:22.579 --> 18:27.193
Jets overhead
dropped nuclear bombs.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.760
Our ancestors knew
death was coming,

18:29.804 --> 18:32.633
but just before
the explosions,

18:32.676 --> 18:35.549
an angel appeared to them,

18:35.592 --> 18:38.160
surrounded by pillars

18:38.204 --> 18:41.120
of fire,
and delivered our church

18:41.163 --> 18:43.557
and those taking shelter in it

18:43.600 --> 18:45.646
here to Terralysium.

18:45.689 --> 18:50.433
They awoke here
and founded New Eden.

18:50.477 --> 18:54.133
But who should they
thank for this salvation?

18:54.176 --> 18:56.135
Which God?

18:56.178 --> 18:57.919
There were so many
faiths among them,

18:57.962 --> 19:00.313
how would they solve
such a quandary?

19:00.356 --> 19:02.532
By combining all religions
into one.

19:04.491 --> 19:07.276
Say my religion is science.

19:07.320 --> 19:11.019
Has anyone used it
to find an alternate answer

19:11.062 --> 19:12.673
to how our ancestors got here?

19:12.716 --> 19:15.850
How, without the proper
technology?

19:15.893 --> 19:17.765
All we've got are
decaying relics

19:17.808 --> 19:19.332
that came with
the First Saved.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.334
WOMAN: For years,
Jacob and Rose

19:21.377 --> 19:24.511
have tried to get
the church lights back on.

19:24.554 --> 19:28.210
Since the battery units died,
and the windows went dark,

19:28.254 --> 19:31.344
pilgrimages to our shrine
have dwindled.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.608
Still, there must be
some rational theories

19:34.651 --> 19:36.523
about how the church
was transported here.

19:36.566 --> 19:41.223
A camera attached
to a soldier's helmet exists

19:41.267 --> 19:42.790
from that time, but

19:42.833 --> 19:44.574
it's broken.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.185
WOMAN: We have no
need for proof.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.056
We are guided by

19:48.099 --> 19:50.841
the existence of something
greater than ourselves--

19:50.885 --> 19:52.887
our faith.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.411
It's getting late.

19:55.455 --> 19:56.934
We're setting out
early tomorrow.

19:56.978 --> 20:01.896
Would you mind if we take
shelter in your church?

20:01.939 --> 20:05.029
Of course not.Thank you for the fellowship.

20:06.553 --> 20:09.599
Peace be with you.And also with you.

20:13.864 --> 20:17.172
WOMAN:
Tilly?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.305
Tilly, wake up.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.307
What? Where am I?

20:21.350 --> 20:22.786
Don't worry.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.266
They're helping you.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.181
I was there when
you got hurt.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.227
It was so scary.
I thought I lost you.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.186
Oh, you shouldn't
do that. Oh, no.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.798
Help!
What's going on?

20:34.842 --> 20:36.887
SARU: Ensign
Tilly, dissecting

20:36.931 --> 20:40.239
a highly unstable interstellar
asteroid by yourself?

20:40.282 --> 20:42.328
This lapse in judgment
put your shipmates at risk

20:42.371 --> 20:43.720
and nearly got you killed.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.244
Will you corroborate
that, Dr. Pollard?

20:45.287 --> 20:47.246
He's correct.
Almost dead. You.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.465
But you're gonna be okay.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.293
Sorry, sir. I was trying
to help Commander Stamets.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.382
I do not see how one
leads to the other.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.906
I took an asteroid sample
in the hopes

20:55.950 --> 20:58.126
that I could design
a coherent resonator

20:58.169 --> 20:59.867
to work with the spores instead.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.303
Essentially building

21:01.347 --> 21:02.957
a dark-matter
navigational interface

21:03.000 --> 21:05.307
so that Commander Stamets
will no longer have

21:05.351 --> 21:07.657
to interface with
the spore drive?

21:11.574 --> 21:15.274
Before we can care for others,
we must care for ourselves.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.276
Has this jeopardized
my placement

21:17.319 --> 21:19.016
in the Command Training Program?

21:19.060 --> 21:22.237
It has not, as long as
it is not an indicator

21:22.281 --> 21:24.108
of more reckless behavior.

21:24.152 --> 21:29.113
You are the youngest candidate
ever accepted into the CTP.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.420
Being the only
Kelpien in Starfleet,

21:31.464 --> 21:35.685
I know how it feels to
want to prove your worth.

21:35.729 --> 21:39.036
I was so determined to be
a good example of my race,

21:39.080 --> 21:41.430
I learned 90 different
Federation languages.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.606
Fluently?

21:43.650 --> 21:46.740
My point is,

21:46.783 --> 21:49.873
I put an inordinate
amount of responsibility

21:49.917 --> 21:53.790
on these slender shoulders,
often to my detriment.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.966
I expect you

21:56.010 --> 21:58.578
to take better care.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.146
You are important.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.802
RHYS:
Mr. Saru

22:05.846 --> 22:07.238
to the bridge immediately.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.414
Report.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.241
Sensors detecting
a massive spike

22:10.285 --> 22:12.461
of ionizing radiation
in the upper atmosphere.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.985
There's been a disruption
in the gravitational stability

22:15.029 --> 22:16.900
of the planet's outermost ring.

22:16.944 --> 22:19.250
This could relate
to the signals.

22:19.294 --> 22:21.470
Radioactive particles
from the ring are on the way

22:21.514 --> 22:23.385
to the planet's surface.Levels?

22:23.429 --> 22:25.169
Bad.Bad?

22:25.213 --> 22:26.867
Really bad. In 64 minutes,

22:26.910 --> 22:29.522
the radiation will reach
the upper atmosphere, causing...

22:29.565 --> 22:32.394
an extinction level event.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.702
Um...

22:35.745 --> 22:37.007
tell transporters

22:37.051 --> 22:38.052
to stand by.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.836
Bryce, please contact
the captain.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.490
Not possible, sir.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.536
The radiation's interfering
with our communication.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.929
We won't be able
to transport either.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.061
Shall I send a shuttle
to get them, sir?

22:47.104 --> 22:49.672
No. The shuttle's
ionized carbon exhaust

22:49.716 --> 22:52.501
will create a runaway
positive feedback loop

22:52.545 --> 22:54.547
that will accelerate
the particles' arrival.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.288
I heard there was a problem.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.595
Happy to have you,
as always, Mr. Stamets,

22:59.639 --> 23:00.770
especially now.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.598
It's highly unlikely

23:02.642 --> 23:05.949
that they can see the outer ring
from the planet's surface.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.430
They'll never know
what's coming until it hits.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.389
Time?
62 minutes

23:10.432 --> 23:12.782
before nuclear winter
becomes irreversible.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.698
SARU:
If we were

23:15.742 --> 23:17.439
brought here,

23:17.483 --> 23:20.007
perhaps this is why.

23:21.661 --> 23:23.010
We are responsible

23:23.053 --> 23:24.315
not only to our landing party

23:24.359 --> 23:28.276
but to every living being
on that planet.

23:28.319 --> 23:31.410
Discoverywill not allow
a catastrophe on her watch.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.281
Clock is ticking.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.065
Let us get to work.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.030
PIKE: Clearly, that distress
beacon has been broadcasting

23:43.073 --> 23:44.684
without these people
even knowing it.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.294
We'll turn it off so
no one else disturbs this place

23:46.337 --> 23:47.861
and then beam out.

23:47.904 --> 23:51.473
OWOSEKUN: I isolated
the distress beacon signal.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.127
It's coming from down here.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.085
PIKE: Let's hope
that helmet camera's here, too.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.179
I'm sorry, sir.

24:02.223 --> 24:04.660
You can't be suggesting
that we leave them here.

24:04.704 --> 24:07.446
Find that
beacon, please,

24:07.489 --> 24:08.882
Owosekun.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.144
Before we
transported down,

24:10.187 --> 24:12.146
you said you had a hunch

24:12.189 --> 24:14.583
the signal we were following was
leading us to a rescue mission.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.411
No one needs rescuing, Burnham.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.978
This place

24:18.021 --> 24:19.501
really is a new Eden.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.938
Amesha and the others
are kin to us.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.985
They deserve to be reintegrated
into modern society.

24:25.028 --> 24:26.987
By their own account,
they left Earth in 2053.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.772
They did not use a starship.
That makes them pre-warp,

24:29.816 --> 24:32.558
subject to General Order 1.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.951
We cannot interfere
with their natural development.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.301
But they believe Earth and
the human race were destroyed.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.912
They're wrong.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.480
Worse, the faith
they cling to is a lie.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.785
Can you prove that?

24:42.829 --> 24:45.309
What I will prove

24:45.353 --> 24:47.964
is that none of this happened
because of some miracle.

24:48.008 --> 24:49.009
OWOSEKUN:
Got it!

24:49.052 --> 24:50.967
The battery's dead,

24:51.011 --> 24:52.186
but...

24:52.229 --> 24:54.493
This is strange.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.799
Someone jury-rigged it
to continue transmitting

24:56.843 --> 24:57.974
the distress call.

24:58.018 --> 25:01.021
JACOB:
And you answered.

25:01.064 --> 25:04.981
There were scientists
among the First Saved, too.

25:05.025 --> 25:08.028
My family. For generations,
we tended to that beacon.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.117
No one else knew it was
here, and you found it

25:10.160 --> 25:11.553
with that incredible device.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.600
My ancestors were right,
weren't they?

25:14.643 --> 25:17.559
The Earth
wasn't destroyed.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.734
Mankind evolved.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.214
Jacob...

25:20.257 --> 25:22.999
...this-this device,
this has-- it's always been

25:23.043 --> 25:25.480
in my family.
It's for navigation.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.526
Since the other day,

25:27.569 --> 25:30.920
when the red burst appeared in
the sky, I knew you were coming.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.531
That was the light
from your ship, right?

25:32.574 --> 25:35.098
Your hands,
your skin,

25:35.142 --> 25:37.013
unravaged by the labor
we do here.

25:37.057 --> 25:39.146
You're not from
Terralysium.

25:39.189 --> 25:42.236
I can see the truth
in your eyes.

25:42.279 --> 25:43.846
Jacob, listen to me.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.892
You are mistaken.No, I'm not.

25:45.935 --> 25:49.286
I have been waiting for
this day for a long time.

25:49.330 --> 25:52.594
For our true salvation.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.640
PIKE:
Let's go.

25:54.683 --> 25:55.815
We're sorry for trespassing.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.817
No, wait, wait, no.
Don't go. Wait.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.254
Wait! Stop!

26:14.747 --> 26:16.923
Ah. It's locked.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.489
If it's just a slide bolt,

26:18.533 --> 26:19.621
I can use a magnet
to get us out.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.409
Our utility bags are gone.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.629
Jacob must have taken
all of our tech.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.718
To prove his case
to the others, no doubt.

26:29.762 --> 26:32.112
Ah-ha. Got it.

26:41.295 --> 26:44.080
Yep. I can feel it...

26:50.696 --> 26:54.656
God or no God, we are still
bound by General Order 1.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.790
You will not break cover
under any circumstances.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.443
Do you both understand?

26:59.487 --> 27:00.793
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

27:07.800 --> 27:11.020
If "X" doesn't work, try "Y."

27:11.064 --> 27:13.544
If "Y" doesn't work, try "Z."

27:13.588 --> 27:17.070
If "Z" doesn't work,
try drowning your ineptitude

27:17.113 --> 27:18.767
in a Risan mai tai.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.464
Where the hell is Burnham?

27:20.508 --> 27:22.945
I need her to, like, be here
and "yes and..." me.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.860
Can I help you with something?

27:24.904 --> 27:26.906
Yes. Yes, thank you.

27:26.949 --> 27:29.299
I'm-I'm supposed to be
on bed rest,

27:29.343 --> 27:31.954
but that is practically an
affront to my very existence,

27:31.998 --> 27:33.564
'cause the ship's on high alert,

27:33.608 --> 27:35.654
the captain, Burnham, Owo,

27:35.697 --> 27:37.873
not to mention an entire planet,
might be nuked,

27:37.917 --> 27:39.092
and that is not happening.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.659
Why are you looking
at me like that?

27:40.702 --> 27:42.878
You're May, right?
Am I talking too fast?

27:42.922 --> 27:44.967
I'm problem solving.
I've had espressos.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.795
In sickbay?Yeah.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.231
Lives are at stake.

27:48.275 --> 27:49.668
It's always better to ask

27:49.711 --> 27:51.582
for forgiveness than permission.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.584
Exactly. I've been trying
to figure out a way

27:53.628 --> 27:55.935
to stop the downflow
of radioactive debris,

27:55.978 --> 27:57.893
and then it occurred to me
if we could target the source

27:57.937 --> 27:59.416
of the debris...

27:59.460 --> 28:00.722
The ring itself.Yes.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.463
Thank you. We could--
We could pull the debris

28:02.506 --> 28:03.725
away from the planet.

28:03.769 --> 28:04.987
And then, we're alive.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.423
And alive is optimal.

28:06.467 --> 28:09.949
I've been running models
using a tractor beam, but...

28:09.992 --> 28:11.167
Discoverywouldn't
be able to generate

28:11.211 --> 28:12.691
graviton beams powerful enough

28:12.734 --> 28:14.867
to change the course
of the debris field.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.259
You read my mind.

28:16.303 --> 28:17.783
Your mind is so much fun.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.480
If only there were

28:19.523 --> 28:21.700
something on this ship
that could generate

28:21.743 --> 28:23.789
a massive gravitational field.

28:26.182 --> 28:29.490
The asteroid. Dark matter.
In the shuttlebay.

28:29.533 --> 28:30.883
It's-it's-it's...

28:30.926 --> 28:32.841
A little, tiny piece of it
destroyed an entire table.

28:32.885 --> 28:35.496
It was awesome.
You're a genius.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.193
No, you're a genius.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.724
AIRIAM: The ring's radioactive
wave will hit the planet

28:45.767 --> 28:47.769
in four minutes, 32 seconds.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.032
What if we throw all
auxiliary power to phasers?

28:50.076 --> 28:51.555
Destroy the radioactive debris

28:51.599 --> 28:52.992
before it reaches
the lower atmosphere.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.645
That would only give it
a greater concentration.

28:54.689 --> 28:55.995
I got it!

28:56.038 --> 28:57.213
I got it, I got it.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.824
Ensign Tilly, how many times
in a single day

28:58.867 --> 29:00.434
must we have this conversation?

29:00.477 --> 29:02.349
No, no, please, please, sir,
just-just hear me out, okay?

29:02.392 --> 29:05.352
The dark-matter asteroid,
all right, it's massive.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.441
And the more mass an object has,

29:07.484 --> 29:09.443
the greater its
gravitational pull, right?

29:09.486 --> 29:11.358
You-you know this.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.490
Can I just, um, scooch in there?
Thank you. Yeah.

29:13.534 --> 29:17.973
So, if we launch the dark-matter
asteroid from the shuttlebay

29:18.017 --> 29:19.627
on just the right trajectory,

29:19.670 --> 29:22.456
its gravity will pull
the radioactive debris

29:22.499 --> 29:26.025
away from the planet like a,
uh, invisible magnet.

29:27.156 --> 29:28.418
See?

29:30.856 --> 29:32.335
DETMER: For the asteroid
to exit at the correct angle,

29:32.379 --> 29:34.033
I would have to execute
a sustained circular drift.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.512
A donut.

29:35.556 --> 29:38.733
You would be doing
a donut in a starship.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.691
That's true.

29:40.735 --> 29:41.692
Is this possible?

29:41.736 --> 29:43.694
Yes. Except no.

29:43.738 --> 29:46.219
We'd have to launch the asteroid
from within the center

29:46.262 --> 29:48.221
of the ring's debris field.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.179
There is no way I can
pilot us from in there.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.224
I can.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.227
We could jump.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.490
You have exactly

29:56.533 --> 29:58.318
two minutes, 11 seconds
before the wave

29:58.361 --> 30:00.189
of radioactive debris crosses
the point of no return.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.063
Run, Mr. Stamets.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.065
Tell Engineering to ready
the spore drive.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.899
JACOB: The visitors are from
the first Earth.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.030
They brought amazing things:

30:15.074 --> 30:17.076
communication devices,

30:17.119 --> 30:18.077
scientific-data collectors.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.383
Look inside. You'll believe.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.559
PIKE: What happened to
"Thou shalt not steal"?

30:22.603 --> 30:24.866
I just want her
to see the truth.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.520
PIKE: The truth is that
he attacked us.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.522
He violated everything
that the Faith holds dear.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.350
You give us back what you took,

30:30.393 --> 30:31.873
and we'll leave.JACOB:
Listen to me.

30:31.917 --> 30:35.181
They came on a starship.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.052
They can take us back home.

30:37.096 --> 30:40.447
We can experience
the real Earth.

30:40.490 --> 30:42.579
This is your home.

30:42.623 --> 30:46.627
You are living by the corrupt
way of the old Earth, Jacob.

30:49.499 --> 30:51.153
You're the scientist.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.287
Tell her I'm right.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.463
Look.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.946
Captain! No!

31:00.989 --> 31:02.599
No!

31:09.128 --> 31:11.608
He's dying.

31:11.652 --> 31:15.786
Save him. With your technology,
I know you can.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.049
We-we need to get him
to the church

31:17.092 --> 31:18.485
and pray for another
deliverance.

31:18.528 --> 31:19.660
Yes, okay.

31:23.403 --> 31:25.231
STAMETS :
Bridge, we are ready to jump.

31:25.274 --> 31:26.885
And are you ready, Lieutenant?

31:26.928 --> 31:29.888
Had my pilot's license
since 12, sir.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.019
Black alert.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.894
Airiam... now.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.302
SARU:
Detmer!

31:53.346 --> 31:54.825
Initiating donut maneuver, sir.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.516
It's working, sir.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.823
Let us get our
landing party. Now.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.788
Wait, wait, no. Let me in!

32:44.832 --> 32:47.008
Jacob, no. Jacob!

32:56.496 --> 32:59.020
The gods have answered
our prayer.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.371
The angel returned
to save them.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.286
Transport confirms
all are on board.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.636
The asteroid successfully
diverted all the debris

33:06.680 --> 33:08.203
from the planet's atmosphere.

33:08.247 --> 33:09.422
Yes!

33:20.172 --> 33:21.912
Perhaps you should

33:21.956 --> 33:24.828
disobey my direct orders
more often, Ensign.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.048
No, I think your orders
are probably really good.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.919
I need to pass out now.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.051
Do you need assistance?

33:30.095 --> 33:31.313
No, I'm good. I'm just...

33:31.357 --> 33:32.532
straight to bed.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.633
Way to go, Stilly.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.635
Stilly?

33:48.678 --> 33:51.464
Wait, are you...?

34:06.479 --> 34:08.350
Welcome back, Captain.

34:08.393 --> 34:11.049
You made it. But your ribs,

34:11.092 --> 34:13.268
they're gonna feel
like the xylophone

34:13.312 --> 34:14.704
in a Klingon marching band.

34:14.748 --> 34:17.315
Consider yourself
lucky to be alive.

34:19.927 --> 34:24.583
COMPUTER: Musk Junior High
School, Class of 2247.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.585
Signatures page.

34:26.629 --> 34:30.155
Name: May something.

34:30.197 --> 34:32.025
Stilly, what the heck?

34:32.070 --> 34:33.418
You're moving again?

34:33.462 --> 34:35.768
It's only been six months.

34:35.812 --> 34:39.077
You're the nicest person I've
ever met at this awful school.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.860
I'll miss our lunches.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.384
They were like
little earthquakes.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.299
"Bounce, bounce, bounce."

34:44.342 --> 34:47.781
Please, stay in touch.
Love, May Ahearn.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.043
Ahearn.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.263
Knew it.

34:51.306 --> 34:54.744
Computer, locate quarters
for "Ahearn, May."

34:54.788 --> 34:58.574
COMPUTER: Ship's manifest
has no such name.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.272
Computer,
search Federation database

35:00.315 --> 35:02.622
for the whereabouts
of "Ahearn, May,"

35:02.665 --> 35:05.407
originally from San Francisco,
California, Earth.

35:05.451 --> 35:09.846
COMPUTER: Working.
"Ahearn, May Theresa."

35:09.890 --> 35:13.023
Born April 30, 2236.

35:13.067 --> 35:17.550
Deceased June 9, 2252.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.731
Come.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.866
You wanted to see me?

35:29.910 --> 35:32.739
Yes. And don't make me laugh.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.480
Fortunately for you,
I was raised on Vulcan.

35:34.523 --> 35:35.916
We don't do funny.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.180
Maybe I should just shut up.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.883
I wanted to thank you

35:46.927 --> 35:48.711
for following orders
and maintaining our cover

35:48.755 --> 35:50.887
despite your captain's
impairment.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.889
And by impairment,

35:52.933 --> 35:55.718
I-I mean having a phaser
go off in my chest.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.765
Well, sir,
I learned the hard way

35:58.808 --> 36:00.854
what not following orders
can lead to.

36:00.897 --> 36:03.552
In fact,

36:03.596 --> 36:06.381
you asked earlier if there was
anything I ought to tell you.

36:06.425 --> 36:09.210
There is, and I didn't.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.081
The angelic being

36:11.125 --> 36:15.347
they worship on Terralysium,
it appeared to me,

36:15.390 --> 36:17.218
on the asteroid.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.828
Why didn't you say anything?

36:18.872 --> 36:21.309
I was injured.
I thought I was hallucinating.

36:21.353 --> 36:24.530
That can't be a coincidence.

36:24.573 --> 36:27.446
Two signals,
two angel sightings.

36:27.489 --> 36:30.188
With all due respect, sir,
the word "angel"

36:30.231 --> 36:32.233
does carry with it
certain implications.

36:32.277 --> 36:35.932
I saw a form.

36:35.976 --> 36:41.764
It hovered above me,
and it was...

36:41.808 --> 36:44.376
to be completely honest,
quite beautiful.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.726
But beyond that,

36:46.769 --> 36:48.989
I wouldn't ascribe to it
divine properties.

36:49.032 --> 36:53.254
Those people in New Eden do.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.909
And they would find
your experience

36:55.952 --> 36:57.693
to be quite a revelation.

36:57.737 --> 37:01.175
Is that how you see it, sir?
As a revelation?

37:02.394 --> 37:05.310
At the very least,

37:05.353 --> 37:10.750
this new information
creates more context.

37:10.793 --> 37:15.624
And the context
can alter our perspective.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.282
Well, what about Jacob?

37:21.326 --> 37:24.285
Isn't he entitled
to a little context?

37:24.329 --> 37:27.984
He knows in his heart
who and what we are.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.986
And we chose to lie to him.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.554
We have the power
to help him solve a mystery

37:32.598 --> 37:35.818
that's plagued his family
for 200 years.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.080
We could alter
hisperspective.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.431
Look, I feel for the guy, too.

37:39.474 --> 37:45.263
But even angels are no excuse
for violating General Order 1.

37:45.306 --> 37:48.309
Yeah, well, I have a better
excuse: his helmet camera.

37:48.353 --> 37:51.747
Jacob said it recorded
whatever was in that church

37:51.791 --> 37:53.314
the day they
were taken.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.925
And as I see it, sir,
the urgency of our mission

37:55.969 --> 37:58.276
directly contradicts
Starfleet's first rule.

37:58.319 --> 38:01.191
To serve one goal,
the other has to be sacrificed.

38:01.235 --> 38:05.631
But that's a choice
only a captain can make.

38:17.077 --> 38:20.298
PIKE:
I lied.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.691
To protect the others
from the truth.

38:22.735 --> 38:27.043
The truth is...
you were right about us.

38:27.087 --> 38:30.220
I-I know what it's like
to live with doubt,

38:30.264 --> 38:32.875
and I guess I-I didn't
want that for you.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.704
How'd you get here?

38:35.748 --> 38:37.315
Beam of light?

38:37.358 --> 38:38.707
Yes, actually.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.796
It's called a transporter.

38:40.840 --> 38:44.974
It converts a-a person or an
object into an energy pattern,

38:45.018 --> 38:47.063
then "beams" it to a target,

38:47.107 --> 38:50.066
where it's eventually
reconverted back into matter.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.678
Do you have a ship?

38:54.941 --> 38:59.772
Do you, uh, fly among the stars?

38:59.815 --> 39:02.775
Yeah.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.912
And...

39:09.956 --> 39:11.653
Earth?Well, we're-we're part

39:11.697 --> 39:14.613
of a galactic federation now,

39:14.656 --> 39:17.920
dedicated to peace, exploration
and protecting places

39:17.964 --> 39:19.618
such as your planet.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.924
Jacob,

39:21.968 --> 39:24.013
we cannot intervene.

39:24.057 --> 39:25.928
Your society
has to evolve

39:25.972 --> 39:27.930
in its own way.

39:30.237 --> 39:33.109
My entire family spent

39:33.153 --> 39:37.070
their whole lives
hoping to get a confirmation

39:37.113 --> 39:40.421
that what we believed was true.

39:41.683 --> 39:44.207
And you...

39:44.251 --> 39:48.429
gave me that answer.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.170
Something none of
them ever got.

39:50.213 --> 39:54.392
And that is enough for me.

40:04.967 --> 40:07.622
Thank you.
Because of you,

40:07.666 --> 40:10.799
we're not lost anymore.

40:14.934 --> 40:18.677
How about this power cell,

40:18.720 --> 40:21.680
with a very long lifespan,
in exchange

40:21.723 --> 40:26.336
for a soldier's broken camera
circa 2053?

40:43.223 --> 40:45.181
I hope we meet again, Jacob.

40:45.225 --> 40:46.705
I know we will.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.621
You might want to stand back.

40:53.276 --> 40:56.454
Pike to Discovery,
one to transport.

41:09.858 --> 41:11.381
Okay...

42:05.174 --> 42:06.785
MAN :
We're under attack!

42:06.828 --> 42:10.179
Holed up inside. A few hundred
souls: men, women and children.

42:10.223 --> 42:12.834
Wait...

42:12.878 --> 42:14.270
Something's happening...

42:15.924 --> 42:18.971
Take cover! Protect the young!

42:19.014 --> 42:20.625
Oh! Blinding light!

42:20.668 --> 42:22.714
Oh, my gosh!
