 He's the one who keeps         
 leaving the fucking gate open

             Jacob,             

16:14.306 --> 16:16.040
      who're these people?      

16:19.411 --> 16:20.745
           - Family.

          (snickering)

     aren't your family.        

16:26.386 --> 16:27.618
         This ain't us.         

16:28.454 --> 16:30.455
    It's never gonna be us.     

16:43.836 --> 16:46.504

17:00.319 --> 17:03.421
       Let me tell you          
       something, Jacob.        

17:03.423 --> 17:05.757
      We are all you got.       

17:05.759 --> 17:08.593
       We are all you're        
       ever gonna get.          

17:11.829 --> 17:14.332
  Do you understand me, Jacob?  

17:14.334 --> 17:16.434
And the sooner you realize this,

17:16.435 --> 17:19.503
 the sooner you get it through  
 your thick, fucking skull      

17:19.506 --> 17:21.739
      that these people         
      are not your family.      

17:21.741 --> 17:23.141
   Do you understand, Jacob?!   

17:23.143 --> 17:24.075
      Do you fucking get--      

17:24.077 --> 17:25.309
             - Hey!             

17:25.310 --> 17:27.377
      - You're not right        
      in the head, Jacob.       

17:27.380 --> 17:28.880
  Do you under-fucking-stand?   

17:28.882 --> 17:29.781
             - Hey!             

17:34.620 --> 17:36.554
         I got an idea.         

17:36.556 --> 17:38.956
  Why don't we go out tonight?  

17:41.360 --> 17:43.528
        I've got a plan.        

17:43.530 --> 17:45.029
        - I don't know.         

17:45.031 --> 17:46.164
           - Fuck it.           

17:46.166 --> 17:48.733
 I gotta get out of here and... 

17:49.868 --> 17:53.438
    we can even see if          
    Michael's still got it.     

18:10.556 --> 18:11.622
          - All right.          

18:13.092 --> 18:14.725
          Let's do it.          

18:14.727 --> 18:16.294
       Get the car ready.       

18:24.136 --> 18:26.370
   You gonna watch the house?   

18:28.307 --> 18:29.440
         - Yeah, sure.          

18:33.946 --> 18:34.846

      twice, you get them.      

22:18.036 --> 22:19.470

22:19.472 --> 22:20.438

26:46.906 --> 26:47.838
 and we're not with the girls,  

26:47.840 --> 26:49.974
  I want you to watch Michael.  

26:49.976 --> 26:51.709
    I don't know what's         
    going through his head,     

26:51.711 --> 26:54.645
       but I don't think        
       we can trust him.        

26:54.647 --> 26:56.080
          I'm serious.          

26:56.082 --> 26:58.916
We need to keep him on a leash.

    shit I'm talking about.

          - So angry.           

27:17.803 --> 27:20.838
  - When we get back, get       
  Jacob to clean up the body.   

27:20.840 --> 27:22.940
      That'll teach him         
      some responsibility.      

27:22.942 --> 27:24.241
        - I heard that.         

27:25.410 --> 27:26.310

        (reel clicking)         

30:51.983 --> 30:55.886
    - Everyone knows of the     
    one and only Bunnyman.      

30:57.322 --> 30:59.523
  - Who the fuck is Bunnyman?   

30:59.525 --> 31:02.125
      - It's fucking            
      Michael, all right?       

31:02.127 --> 31:04.361
 I'm calling him Bunnyman now.  

31:04.363 --> 31:06.196
  If you can shut the fuck up,  

31:06.198 --> 31:08.498
  I'm gonna finish my speech.   

31:13.071 --> 31:15.372
Why we gotta do a speech anyway?

31:15.374 --> 31:17.608
   - Because you've got to      
   practice before the haunt.   

31:17.610 --> 31:19.576
    I don't want you            
    socially-fucking-awkward    

31:19.578 --> 31:21.712
   in front of these people.    

31:22.881 --> 31:24.715
       Who the fuck is          
       Bunnyman, anyway?        

31:24.717 --> 31:29.453
    - I don't know. I don't     
    fucking care, all right?    

31:29.455 --> 31:31.521
    But what I do know is...    

31:35.226 --> 31:36.894
            (crying)            

31:36.896 --> 31:38.595
       even the deaf kids       
       in Guadalajara           

31:38.597 --> 31:40.764
have heard the rumors about him.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.633
           (laughing)           

31:42.635 --> 31:44.768
            (crying)            

31:46.838 --> 31:48.906
    He's come back home now.    

31:52.677 --> 31:57.014
 He's been traveling all around 
 the world for months on end.   

31:57.016 --> 31:59.516
 Picking up all the bad habits  

32:00.618 --> 32:03.854
     from all the criminals     
     around the world.          

32:04.956 --> 32:08.392
     Nobody knows how many      
     people he's killed.        

32:08.394 --> 32:10.627
   Nobody, and I mean nobody,   

32:11.429 --> 32:13.764
  is brave enough to ask him.   

32:19.170 --> 32:21.471
           (laughing)           

32:23.641 --> 32:26.910
       - How many people        
       have you killed?         

32:26.912 --> 32:29.713
        (chilling music)        

32:38.990 --> 32:39.890
             - Hey!             

32:41.225 --> 32:44.061
 Cover your eyes and your ears  

32:44.063 --> 32:47.364
      because, yes, yes,        
      the rumors are true.      

32:49.100 --> 32:52.869
      What you're about to      
      see can't be unseen.      

32:52.871 --> 32:55.605

33:11.155 --> 33:12.956
     Ladies and gentlemen,      

33:14.859 --> 33:18.261
     I present to you, the      
     birth of Bunnyman.         

33:21.733 --> 33:24.701
       (foreboding music)       

33:48.092 --> 33:49.426
        - Hey, Michael.         

33:51.729 --> 33:54.398
You look like a chicken nugget. 

33:55.400 --> 33:57.734
           (laughing)           

34:02.840 --> 34:04.174
        - Yeah, he does.        

34:06.711 --> 34:08.078
            He does.            

34:08.080 --> 34:10.414
           (laughing)           

34:23.194 --> 34:25.161
    Just like extra crispy.     

34:25.164 --> 34:26.630
       That shit's nasty.       

34:26.632 --> 34:29.933
     His skin's all             
     flaking off and shit.      

34:29.935 --> 34:32.235
           (laughing)           

34:33.304 --> 34:35.072
   Oh, Michael's getting mad.   

34:35.074 --> 34:38.208
    - [John] What're you        
    gonna do, motherfucker?     

34:38.210 --> 34:41.210
       (foreboding music)       

34:42.547 --> 34:44.880
           (laughing)           

34:48.886 --> 34:49.985
        - What happened?        

34:49.987 --> 34:51.288
        What did we do?         

34:52.190 --> 34:53.590
      - You know Michael.       

34:53.592 --> 34:55.158
      He just needs to          
      blow off some steam.      

34:55.159 --> 34:56.393
         He'll be back.         

35:13.911 --> 35:16.646
        (ominous music)         

35:20.118 --> 35:22.252
            (crying)            

35:49.680 --> 35:50.747
          - All right.          

35:51.816 --> 35:54.017
     You have two options.      

35:54.019 --> 35:55.919
     Option A and option B.     

35:57.088 --> 35:57.988
           Option A.            

36:00.858 --> 36:01.858
        You drink this.         

36:01.860 --> 36:02.859
          Water or...           

36:07.231 --> 36:09.599
   let those spiders crawl--    

36:09.601 --> 36:11.067
             - No!              

36:11.069 --> 36:13.203
            (crying)            

36:16.841 --> 36:19.509
    - So what's it gonna be?    

36:19.511 --> 36:20.410
             Water?             

36:23.614 --> 36:24.614
          Or spiders?           

36:28.352 --> 36:31.354
      Didn't I tell you         
      to make a decision?       

36:31.356 --> 36:32.255
              Huh?              

36:34.725 --> 36:36.626
     If you don't pick one,     

36:37.762 --> 36:40.030
    I will make you do both.    

36:40.032 --> 36:42.199
            (crying)            

36:47.471 --> 36:48.371

36:53.077 --> 36:53.977
            Spiders?            

36:58.115 --> 36:59.015
            - Water.            

37:01.419 --> 37:02.385
          - You sure?           

37:06.324 --> 37:08.491

        (intense music)         

37:32.516 --> 37:34.918

           - Oh god.            

38:27.773 --> 38:29.406
      - You're so pretty.       

38:33.444 --> 38:35.945
      For you, sweetheart.      

38:35.947 --> 38:37.714

            (crying)

      - Or let the spiders      

38:50.295 --> 38:51.461
         crawl on you.          

38:57.935 --> 38:59.269
           - Spiders.           

38:59.271 --> 39:00.337
          - All right.          

39:03.641 --> 39:06.376

         I don't know.          

41:40.131 --> 41:42.131
    I don't think it's smart    
    to just randomly show up    

41:42.133 --> 41:44.601
 and go through people's stuff. 

41:44.603 --> 41:45.902
      - Look, we're lost.       

41:45.904 --> 41:46.870

       around in circles,

  we're gonna run out of gas.

  Besides, maybe there's        
  somebody here that can help.  

41:52.444 --> 41:55.812
     - [Woman] Well, I          
     think it's a bad idea.     

41:55.814 --> 41:58.147
  - I think it's a great idea.  

41:58.149 --> 42:00.283

42:12.330 --> 42:13.463
         - I hope not.          

42:18.769 --> 42:21.204
      - Rachel, stop            
      touching everything.      

42:21.206 --> 42:23.206
      You're gonna break

45:45.243 --> 45:46.709
     - You have to help us.     

45:46.711 --> 45:48.344
    There's someone in there    

45:48.346 --> 45:49.512
         and this guy.          

45:50.314 --> 45:52.248
Her friend was in the elevator. 

45:52.250 --> 45:53.382
          - Calm down.          

45:53.384 --> 45:54.617
        What's going on?        

45:54.619 --> 45:56.619

      trying to kills us.       

45:56.621 --> 45:57.587
          - Yeah, me.

     Jacob, not right now.

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:43.972
        and leave town?         

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.776

      what we're gonna do.      

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.381
   We're gonna pack up as       
   much shit as we can carry    

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:54.716
 and get the fuck out of town.  

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:56.184
  That's what we're gonna do.   

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:58.386
    I don't need to tell you    
    it takes at least a week    

01:05:58.388 --> 01:05:59.888
     to pack up the trucks,     

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.656
   which means we're gonna      
   lose thousands of dollars    

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:03.458
         of equipment.          

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.027
We had a good thing going, here.

01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:07.128
 I, for one, am fucking pissed  

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.196
        because we gotta        
        leave because of        

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:10.498
  that retarded motherfucker.   

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:12.701
            And you.            

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:14.703
      We should have never      
      let you come back.        

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:16.137
 You jeopardized all our lives  

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:17.639
and cost us thousands of dollars

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:21.209
     just because of your       
     fucking anger issues.      

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.216
       What're you gonna        
       do, motherfucker?        

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:30.585
 - Hey John, relax, all right?  

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:32.187
 How much time do we have left? 

01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:35.023
       - I'd say we got         
       about 20 minutes.        

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:38.226
      Then it's every           
      man for themselves.       

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:40.095
      - What do you mean?       

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:41.830
     - Do I have to fucking     
     spell it out for you?      

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:43.198
    We go our separate ways.    

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.233
  That's it, pure and simple.   

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:47.869
      But first, I want         
      this motherfucker to      
      be held accountable       

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:49.270
        for what he did.        

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:51.740
    - Take Michael outside.     

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:52.907
             - But?             

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:54.275
          - Take him!           

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:55.844
     Sorry, but you've          
     gotta leave your home      

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:57.212
 and find a new place to live.  

01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:59.581
      Don't worry, you'll       
      figure it out.            

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:03.618
  But right now, I really need  
  you to take Michael outside.  

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.486
             Jacob!             

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:07.856
     Take Michael outside.      

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:18.833
       - This ain't over.       

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:21.503
This ain't over by a long shot. 

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:25.040
       You better watch         
       your fucking back.       

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:29.477
  Next time we come, you        
  better be fucking prepared.   

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.513
        (intense music)         

01:07:31.515 --> 01:07:32.547
      - Jacob, get              
      Michael out of here.      

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:33.648
  Come on! Police are coming.   

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:34.783
       Hurry the fuck up!       

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:36.918
   Come on! Get out of here!    

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.489
        (intense music)         

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:54.636
- This is the most dysfunctional
god damn family I know.         

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.041
       - What's the plan?       

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.879
   - We have to kill Michael.   

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.983
     We need to kill            
     Michael, here and now.     

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:11.686
    Hopefully the cops will     
    pin this shit on him        

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.254
   and take some heat off us.   

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:14.089
         - Yeah, but--          

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:16.091
      - It's the only way.      

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:18.893
      He fucked up and put      
      us all in jeopardy.       

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:21.029
      Now we'll be lucky        
      if we're not running      

01:08:21.031 --> 01:08:23.031
       for the rest of          
       our god damn lives       

01:08:23.033 --> 01:08:25.533
 because of this motherfucker.  

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:28.837
           It's over.

         (somber music)         

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:43.111

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.113
  You can't stay here no more.  

01:09:46.116 --> 01:09:47.348

        You promise me?         

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.382
      Goodbye, my friend.

            - Jacob!            

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:27.488
 Jacob, where's Michael going?  

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.298
     Where's Michael going?     

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:41.836
        - I don't know.         

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:44.539
          - Bullshit!

   - Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!    

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.852
  Jacob didn't deserve to die.  

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:33.788

  He'll go into the mountains.  

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.567
