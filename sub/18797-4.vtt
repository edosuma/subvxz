00:01.160 --> 00:04.390
David did use prostitutes,
on a fairly industrial level.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.870
I'd had sex with him. For money.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.790
I was cleared of any involvement in my
husband's disappearance 26 years ago.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.550
You are beginning to scare me.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.910
I just want to know when I
can visit him. He's my dad.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.110
"Nightlife supremo David Walker
and party donor Colin Osborne."

00:20.160 --> 00:23.590
I'm not sure of our position,
discussing Colin's departure.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.390
- How much?
- Five thousand.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.310
If you threaten my family's future again,

00:27.360 --> 00:29.390
I will hurt you very badly.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.790
This travel card was found
in an office desk of his.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.750
When was that time Marion broke in?

00:34.800 --> 00:37.310
You're not my friend, Zoe.
You're just another patient

00:37.360 --> 00:40.030
I'll forget as soon as you've gone.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.710
But Elise says you told
her it was about a murder.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.390
What did you tell them?

00:45.440 --> 00:49.070
So we have one IRA activist, Sinead Quinn,

00:49.120 --> 00:52.350
the murder of a Tory party fund-raiser,

00:52.400 --> 00:55.340
and linking them, we have Marion Kelsey.

- Hi.
- Hi.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.230
- I thought you'd be asleep.
- Flo had a nightmare.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.270
Oh, no. Is she all right now?

02:06.320 --> 02:10.150
Fine, yeah. I think she's
just feeling a bit unsettled.

02:10.199 --> 02:13.750
Yeah. Sorry about that. The brief
came in just as I was leaving --

02:13.800 --> 02:16.800
Your clerk said you weren't in the office.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.240
Well, I went to the Oaks to
have some supper while I worked.

02:33.680 --> 02:38.190
What was it like, Col?
The City in the '80s?

02:38.240 --> 02:41.240
Was it really as brutal as everyone says?

02:43.400 --> 02:45.190
Why don't you just ask me outright, Simon?

02:45.240 --> 02:48.510
Did it screw me up so much I
could have killed someone?

02:48.560 --> 02:50.560
Did it?

02:51.320 --> 02:53.760
No, it didn't.

02:59.840 --> 03:03.340
I know I've messed up
here, hugely. But please...

03:03.680 --> 03:08.320
.. please, can I never have
to answer that question again?

03:42.440 --> 03:45.520
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.000
I went for a drive.

04:01.480 --> 04:07.550
To... think how I could explain
to you what happened to me.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.760
What happened to you? Someone
did this to you, did they?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.830
You had nothing to do with the decision?

04:13.880 --> 04:16.820
Of course I had something to do with it.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.990
What I wanted to explain was...

04:21.040 --> 04:26.590
.. at that point in my life I
believed -- wrongly, obviously --

04:26.640 --> 04:29.510
that I had no other choice.

04:29.560 --> 04:34.150
Since when does becoming a prostitute...

04:37.080 --> 04:38.910
What has to have gone wrong

04:38.960 --> 04:43.120
for that to be the best option
available? You weren't a kid, Sara.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.480
This was 1989. You were 21.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.430
And I, I know you lost your parents,

04:52.480 --> 04:54.750
and I know school hadn't
worked out for you,

04:54.800 --> 04:57.800
and I know life had been tough, but this?

04:59.040 --> 05:02.230
So please, please explain to
me what happened in your life

05:02.280 --> 05:06.760
that made having sex with men
for money your only option?

05:12.200 --> 05:13.840
I don't know.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.920
I just...

05:24.360 --> 05:26.480
.. I'd lost my way.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.790
This man, the one that died?

05:30.840 --> 05:33.270
I was abroad when he died. It wasn't me.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.830
- Where?
- It was when I was in Italy.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.910
You've heard me talk about Italy
a million times. It was then.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.590
And you can prove that, can
you, with specific dates?

05:41.640 --> 05:46.430
- To you, or the police?
- The police.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.680
I don't know. I think so.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.430
I think I have photos,
but I'd need to check.

05:51.480 --> 05:56.510
But if I can't, Hass, I
swear on our children's lives

05:56.560 --> 05:59.800
whatever happened to him, it wasn't me.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.670
- I'll sleep in the spare room.
- Please, Hassan --

06:04.720 --> 06:06.910
We never speak to anyone
else about this, Sara.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.390
It never leaves our house.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.000
Please. Ever.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.920
You've... You've broken my heart, my love.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.940
You've broken my heart.

06:56.360 --> 07:01.870
Thank you for coming with me.
It helped, having you there.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.630
You know, my kids aren't
much younger than you,

07:05.680 --> 07:09.380
and, um, their dad... he
died when they were little.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.000
And I know it's different
because you've only just learnt,

07:13.280 --> 07:17.150
but if you ever wanted
to, um, compare notes,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.520
you know, over a beer,

07:20.120 --> 07:22.660
I think they'd be very happy to.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.790
You... You know there's, um,
something, not... right with me.

07:28.840 --> 07:33.070
You... With my, ah... wiring.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.190
So what I'm saying is, um,

07:35.240 --> 07:38.270
that I, I'd like a beer.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.750
But I never really get asked,

07:41.800 --> 07:45.470
so, um, I might be shit at it.

07:45.520 --> 07:49.230
Luckily they're both very good at beer.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.430
So I'm sure they could show you the ropes.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.070
Shall I text you some dates?

07:54.120 --> 07:58.110
- Yeah, I'd, I'd like that.
- OK.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.760
Thanks again.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.990
- Hope you feel better.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.750
- Bye, Mum.
- Bye.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.120
- Yousef?
- I'm late.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.950
.. and we haven't been able to
locate any details of your movements

08:32.000 --> 08:36.190
between your last contact with David
and when you reported him missing.

08:36.240 --> 08:40.190
Is it possible that you could
just jot something down for us?

08:40.240 --> 08:44.430
You want me to remember what I was
doing for 48 hours 27 years ago?

08:44.480 --> 08:50.040
Tragically, I'm sure those few
days are engrained in your memory.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.470
Yeah. I'll do my best.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.430
Thank you, Tessa.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.020
- 'Speak to you soon.'
- Yeah.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.550
OK. So what about Colin?

09:03.600 --> 09:06.910
I presume a place like
the Maudsley is secure?

09:06.960 --> 09:09.950
Well, it'll have secure
units, but it's not a prison,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.870
so I imagine if you wanted
to get out, you could.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.590
To kill a man?

09:17.280 --> 09:19.030
Fran's talking to the hospital today,

09:19.080 --> 09:21.950
checking up on what records they have.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.910
- And any joy with Sinead Quinn?
- Not yet.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.270
We know she was released from Holloway

09:29.320 --> 09:31.230
- under the Good Friday
agreement. - Yeah.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.620
But that's about it so far.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.200
OK.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.990
Marion? Zoe was supposed to
be here for an 11:30 chemo.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.190
Oh. Do you want me to call her parents?

09:46.240 --> 09:48.780
No, it's all right. I'll do it.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.950
Mr Osborne left us in late 1990,
following an incident here

09:59.000 --> 10:02.110
on the evening of March 16, 1990.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.030
An allegation was made
by a temp, Maria Gonzalez,

10:06.080 --> 10:08.830
that at some point during
a bonus celebration party,

10:08.880 --> 10:13.470
a serious sexual assault was
perpetrated by Mr Osborne on her

10:13.520 --> 10:16.830
in an office lavatory cubicle.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.390
What, sexual assault?

10:19.440 --> 10:21.510
She said he raped her.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.910
Sorry -- we've done a full sweep
of Mr Osborne's criminal history,

10:27.960 --> 10:30.790
and there's no record
of any rape allegation.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.580
Well, no, there -- there wouldn't be.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.540
Um... it was handled internally.

10:38.600 --> 10:42.700
For various reasons, it was
never reported to the police.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.360
- Sorry!
- Are you dumb, bruv?

10:56.620 --> 10:59.100
Yousef! What's up?

11:13.300 --> 11:14.810
You're not under arrest.

11:14.860 --> 11:18.490
You're free to end this
interview whenever you like.

11:18.540 --> 11:21.740
I'm just going to ask, Sara, what
sort of services you offered.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.410
Just normal.

11:24.460 --> 11:27.930
- Just straight sex?
- Yeah.

11:27.980 --> 11:31.080
Which is what your
friend Samira Khan said.

11:32.140 --> 11:34.530
However, we do now know

11:34.580 --> 11:40.570
that, ah, David Walker's sexual
tastes were not that normal.

11:40.620 --> 11:44.900
He both liked to hurt
and be hurt by women.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.690
University College Hospital,

11:48.740 --> 11:52.090
less than 100 yards from
your old Kings Cross flat.

11:52.140 --> 11:56.170
do you remember attending UCH A&E

11:56.220 --> 11:59.250
on 16 February 1990?

11:59.300 --> 12:03.090
The same day, in fact,
that you sent your address

12:03.140 --> 12:05.540
to David Walker's pager?

12:06.540 --> 12:08.690
No.

12:08.740 --> 12:10.770
The hospital records

12:10.820 --> 12:14.330
show that you presented with
a suspected dislocated jaw.

12:14.380 --> 12:19.850
You don't recall sustaining
this rather serious injury?

12:21.450 --> 12:22.450
Not really.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.250
It was an occupational hazard.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.610
Well, indeed.

12:27.660 --> 12:31.620
We were wondering if it was David
Walker that inflicted this injury.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.290
- I don't remember him.
- And next time he turned up,

12:35.340 --> 12:37.010
- he got even more
violent with you -- - No.

12:37.060 --> 12:40.730
- -- and in self-defence...
- No. I don't remember this man.

12:40.780 --> 12:43.980
When he was murdered,
I was living in Italy.

12:44.060 --> 12:49.250
So you say you left the UK in March, Sara,

12:49.300 --> 12:52.500
- and went to Europe for nine months.
- I don't "say" it. I did.

12:54.180 --> 12:57.970
- Where did you stay?
- Hostels, pensions. I moved around.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.010
- Was that on your own?
- Yeah.

13:00.060 --> 13:03.540
- Did you work?
- Yeah. In bars and clubs.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.530
- So you have no payslips, or...
- It was cash in hand.

13:07.580 --> 13:10.170
Did you make any friends
who could vouch for you?

13:10.220 --> 13:14.130
I made friends, yeah. The
sort you do on holiday.

13:14.180 --> 13:18.050
But none I could remember 30 years later.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.700
Mm.

13:22.980 --> 13:24.810
We just need some proof, Sara,

13:24.860 --> 13:26.570
- that you --
- You've already said.

13:26.620 --> 13:30.850
Check passport records,
or however you do it.

13:30.900 --> 13:35.090
We're in the process of doing
that. But it's not that easy.

13:35.140 --> 13:38.300
So anything else you can give
us will be enormously helpful.

13:42.580 --> 13:44.980
OK. Thank you for your time.

13:49.820 --> 13:51.690
Sorry -- one thing.

13:53.380 --> 13:57.650
Just upping sticks like that and
heading off abroad for nine months --

13:57.700 --> 14:00.240
it's quite a big deal, isn't it?

14:01.500 --> 14:03.370
Anything in particular prompt that move?

14:03.420 --> 14:07.420
It wasn't any one thing, if
that's what you're implying.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.410
It was my life.

14:10.460 --> 14:13.860
I knew if I'd stayed any
longer, I would have died.

14:14.860 --> 14:16.860
And I wanted to live.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.700
We'll be in touch.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.090
Her parents thought she was here.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.930
So when I called, they looked
in her room and found her diary.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.330
Were you drinking with her two nights ago?

14:44.380 --> 14:47.850
Absolutely not. I mean,
I -- I was in the pub,

14:47.900 --> 14:49.530
but I went there on my own.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.450
But you told her to
leave? She was under age,

14:51.500 --> 14:53.610
- and it was completely inappropriate?
- Yes, I did.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.730
Then can you explain
why it says in her diary

14:55.780 --> 14:58.720
that you bought her a Malibu and orange?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.810
- I bought her one drink.
- Oh.

15:01.860 --> 15:05.760
I let her sit with me for two
minutes, and then I left.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.210
OK.

15:07.260 --> 15:09.290
Well, I need to speak to my line manager.

15:09.340 --> 15:10.930
- I think you need to go home.
- What?

15:10.980 --> 15:14.170
How can you not get, you completely
overstepped the boundaries?

15:14.220 --> 15:16.250
- Nicola, please --
- She's a 17-year-old kid,

15:16.300 --> 15:18.050
with a very weakened immune system.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.890
You're meant to be caring for
her, not getting her drunk.

15:20.940 --> 15:24.260
- Your judgement's gone.
- I'm so sorry. I, I...

15:26.860 --> 15:28.530
I'm not in a good place at home.

15:28.580 --> 15:31.210
A few things in my personal
life that's going wrong.

15:31.260 --> 15:34.530
- Can I please speak to the parents?
- No, you're going nowhere near them.

15:34.580 --> 15:36.730
They're on their way here,
and they're not happy.

15:36.780 --> 15:40.410
- Go home, Marion.
- Did she say anything in her diary

15:40.460 --> 15:43.700
- about where she was going?
- No, and she's not answering her phone.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.100
No one has any idea where she is.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.250
And it was a woman who
made the allegation?

16:03.300 --> 16:05.090
'Yes. Why?'

16:05.140 --> 16:07.480
Because Colin Osborne's gay.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.650
Right...

16:10.700 --> 16:13.370
Well, I'm going to try and track her down,

16:13.420 --> 16:16.330
and I've got the name of the
lawyer from Klein Egerton

16:16.380 --> 16:20.180
who handled it at the time.
I think he's still alive.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.700
- We'll speak to you later.
- 'OK, guv.'

16:25.220 --> 16:27.970
Maybe it was this that
prompted his breakdown.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.520
The timing seems a bit
coincidental, doesn't it?

16:32.860 --> 16:35.490
Though how it connects to David Walker...

16:35.540 --> 16:40.420
- If it even does.
- If it even does. Yeah.

16:51.860 --> 16:56.020
You took your time.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.819
Whatever it is, bro, it can't be that bad.

17:05.740 --> 17:09.940
- Mate, I'm telling you.
- Yeah. Except you ain't.

17:12.980 --> 17:15.050
You've got to swear, Mus,
you never tell anyone.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.450
Not Ollie, not Piot -- no one.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.980
I promise, man. It's cool.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.220
'This is Zoe. Leave a voicemail.'

17:51.780 --> 17:55.330
- 'Marion? You OK?'
- I'm in trouble, Tony.

17:55.380 --> 17:58.490
- Where are you?
- 'Borough Market.'

17:58.540 --> 18:01.260
Stay there. I'm coming now.

18:32.620 --> 18:35.580
We need more.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.570
We need to buy furniture and stuff.

18:39.620 --> 18:43.100
- We haven't enough.
- I told your boyfriend, no more.

18:49.180 --> 18:51.130
- I'll tell about the car.
- Go ahead, tell.

18:51.180 --> 18:54.780
You're not getting another
fucking cent out of me.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.490
- 'Boss?'
- Jake.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.610
I just had a phone call

19:46.660 --> 19:50.090
off the woman that researched the
society photos of David Walker.

19:50.140 --> 19:53.810
Right. The woman from the local
conservative party office?

19:53.860 --> 19:56.330
Yeah. Name of Mandy Halcross.

19:56.380 --> 19:59.770
It turns out she's worked there for
years in one capacity or another,

19:59.820 --> 20:03.650
but her very first job there was in 1989.

20:03.700 --> 20:08.170
Her mum ran the canteen, and she
helped out in the summer holidays.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.970
'Right.'

20:10.020 --> 20:15.420
So she was 12 years old
in the summer of '89.

20:17.260 --> 20:20.450
'She'd never told anyone this before,

20:20.500 --> 20:22.570
because she's always felt too ashamed,

20:22.620 --> 20:27.250
but she just told me that during
that five-week holiday period,

20:27.300 --> 20:29.370
on two separate occasions,

20:29.420 --> 20:32.220
David Walker sexually assaulted her.'

20:36.460 --> 20:39.460
- 'Boss, are you there?'
- Yeah, I'm here.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.850
How credible did you feel she was?

20:41.900 --> 20:45.890
Well, there were no witnesses,
there'll be no forensic,

20:45.940 --> 20:48.410
the suspect's dead,

20:48.460 --> 20:51.540
so all I've got to go on here is instinct.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.540
'I believed her.'

20:54.900 --> 20:58.170
'It's nearly 30 years since
this happened to her.'

20:58.220 --> 21:00.690
I'm the first person she's ever told,

21:00.740 --> 21:02.010
and...

21:03.380 --> 21:05.330
.. it still ripped her apart when she did.

21:05.380 --> 21:08.890
'There are no newspapers involved.
There's no conspiracy website.'

21:08.940 --> 21:12.860
'She has absolutely nothing to
gain by telling me what she did.'

21:14.500 --> 21:18.100
So yeah, I believed her, 100%.

21:21.620 --> 21:23.650
Get everyone together for a full briefing.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.700
- We'll be back in half-an-hour.
- 'Guv.'

21:34.320 --> 21:38.150
I don't know the man they're asking
about! I'd never have hurt anyone!

21:38.200 --> 21:41.070
I mean, I know you know that, but...

21:41.120 --> 21:43.270
the thing is, the police
found out other stuff

21:43.320 --> 21:45.750
about some people I... hung
about with in the '80s,

21:45.800 --> 21:48.510
- that I shouldn't have.
- What people?

21:48.560 --> 21:50.590
I, I lived in a flat,

21:50.640 --> 21:53.550
I shared a flat, I shared a...

21:53.600 --> 21:55.350
I shared a bed, with a woman...

21:55.400 --> 21:59.040
.. called Sinead Quinn, who...

22:00.120 --> 22:01.960
She was a...

22:02.560 --> 22:05.560
- .. a Republican.
- What do you mean, a republican?

22:06.680 --> 22:10.350
An Irish Republican. IRA.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.790
- No!
- I was fucked up, Tony. I --

22:12.840 --> 22:15.190
- When was this?
- It was in the late '80s.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.310
This -- this is Enniskillen!

22:17.360 --> 22:19.910
This is the Baltic Exchange!
How long were you with her?

22:19.960 --> 22:21.550
- Not more than a year.
- A YEAR?

22:21.600 --> 22:23.830
- I never met -- I never saw any --
- You slept with someone

22:23.880 --> 22:25.950
- who thinks blowing up kids is --
- But like I said,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.230
- I was messed up, Tony.
- Oh, we know you were messed up.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.640
We've known for years. What no one
has the remotest idea of is why!

22:34.800 --> 22:37.040
Jesus Christ.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.390
How two sisters, with exactly
the same upbringing --

22:40.440 --> 22:42.990
I was wondering how long it'd be
till you brought my sister in.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.630
- I'm not bringing her in --
- If she's so marvellous, Tony,

22:45.680 --> 22:49.120
why didn't you just marry her?
You always wanted to fuck her!

22:50.480 --> 22:54.790
- Do you know, I have no
idea who you are. - Really?

22:54.840 --> 22:57.430
Oh, that's it? Walk away? Off you go!

22:57.480 --> 22:59.480
Bye!

23:00.840 --> 23:02.630
You know what, Marion?

23:02.680 --> 23:06.380
I'm beginning to think you
could have done anything!

23:07.320 --> 23:08.910
If he abused a kid,

23:08.960 --> 23:11.430
I don't give a toss what
happened to him in the past.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.710
In fact, if he was abused as a
kid, it makes it almost worse.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.760
He'd know. He'd know how appalling it was.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.760
Except he would have been a very
messed-up human being himself.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.720
- Obviously.
- Yeah. Sorry, I don't buy that.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.760
What do you mean, you don't buy that?

23:31.200 --> 23:33.190
It's just a fact.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.780
It's not my opinion, it's a f...

23:37.200 --> 23:40.140
Oh, for God's sake. Come on, move, move!

23:51.560 --> 23:54.510
- Yus! What's up?
- Oh my days, Jamal.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.910
- You'll never guess what.
- What?

23:56.960 --> 24:00.360
- Well, he told me not
to say anything. - What?

24:09.320 --> 24:12.620
Seriously, what do you
mean, you don't buy it?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.750
Do you really want to get into this?

24:14.800 --> 24:18.790
A person who's been sexually abused
as a child would be very damaged.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.630
Yes, and? It doesn't give them a
right to abuse other kids, does it?

24:21.680 --> 24:23.630
No, of course it doesn't. Bloody right.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.790
I'm not trying to justify it.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.630
- I mean trying to understand.
- Understanding paedophiles. Nice.

24:28.680 --> 24:32.070
No, no. Hang on, hang on.
When a kid who's been abused

24:32.120 --> 24:34.430
goes off the rails and
does something awful,

24:34.480 --> 24:36.470
we don't just dismiss
them as monsters, do we?

24:36.520 --> 24:39.670
- No, because they're children.
- Right. Right.

24:39.720 --> 24:43.750
So when does that kid suddenly
stop deserving some understanding?

24:43.800 --> 24:47.350
Was it on their 10th birthday?
Or their 12th? Their 14th?

24:47.400 --> 24:49.670
- How about when they're an adult?
- Ah -- no.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.110
That's when we let them
take proper responsibility,

24:52.160 --> 24:54.070
punish them and protect society from them.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.870
Why the hell does it also mean
we stop trying to understand them?

24:56.920 --> 24:59.590
So maybe they don't do it again.

24:59.640 --> 25:03.190
Because most abuse victims
don't go and abuse others.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.190
The ones that do choose to,

25:05.240 --> 25:07.550
and that is definitely
beyond my understanding.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.720
Are we done?

25:16.920 --> 25:21.030
So as of today, we are splitting
the investigation into two strands.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.310
The first will follow our
existing line of enquiry,

25:23.360 --> 25:26.550
that one of our persons of
interest murdered David Walker

25:26.600 --> 25:29.110
because of some connection
around the time of his death.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.830
Sara Mahmoud's as a prostitute.

25:30.880 --> 25:34.830
We're looking at a possible
IRA motive with Marion Kelsey.

25:34.880 --> 25:38.350
His wife remains of interest,
for obvious reasons.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.990
And then Colin Osborne,
the only person so far

25:41.040 --> 25:44.550
that we've conclusively proved
actually met David Walker.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.270
Murray, I want you to focus
all your attention now

25:47.320 --> 25:50.150
on finding the Klein Egerton
temp, Maria Gonzalez,

25:50.200 --> 25:52.990
and Fran, we really need
to speak to Sinead Quinn.

25:53.040 --> 25:57.070
Any news yet on Colin and
Sara's alibis for May 8?

25:57.120 --> 26:00.510
- We're still waiting on both.
- OK, so keep on that.

26:00.560 --> 26:05.480
And then, we move into
very different territory.

26:06.920 --> 26:09.430
We already know David
Walker had a lot of secrets.

26:09.480 --> 26:13.630
And now it seems we've just found another.

26:13.680 --> 26:16.790
So myself, Jake and DI Khan

26:16.840 --> 26:18.670
are starting a second line of enquiry,

26:18.720 --> 26:21.430
to investigate if David
Walker was murdered

26:21.480 --> 26:24.830
not because he was going to
expose what happened to him,

26:24.880 --> 26:27.590
30 years before his death,

26:27.640 --> 26:29.630
and not because of any of these reasons,

26:29.680 --> 26:31.950
but maybe as retribution

26:32.000 --> 26:34.870
for sexual abuse he committed himself.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.790
Now, two of these at least,

26:38.840 --> 26:41.550
Colin Osborne and Sara Mahmoud,

26:41.600 --> 26:43.590
have dysfunction in their lives

26:43.640 --> 26:46.870
very consistent with childhood trauma.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.630
All of them seem to have had some
sort of connection with David Walker

26:50.680 --> 26:53.080
in the months before he died.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.790
I think we have to
consider the possibility

26:56.840 --> 27:02.030
that one, and maybe all of them,

27:02.080 --> 27:04.590
were victims of David Walker as children,

27:04.640 --> 27:07.390
and then, years later, took their revenge.

27:07.440 --> 27:11.790
So I want to interrogate every single
aspect of David Walker's adult life,

27:11.840 --> 27:14.880
from when he left school to when he died.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.750
OK?

27:18.800 --> 27:21.560
- [Yes, ma'am.]
- Thank you.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.780
I assume we're going to
speak to the wife first?

27:34.320 --> 27:37.240
Why don't I do her?

27:38.760 --> 27:41.280
Start chasing down his past.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.310
Right... but obviously
she can't read anything,

28:38.360 --> 28:41.100
because you've got a password on it?

28:41.360 --> 28:43.030
Oh, Jesus, Col.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.420
I kept meaning to. I just --

28:46.320 --> 28:48.990
I forgot. I'm sorry.

28:49.040 --> 28:53.750
Right. Well, what is on there, then,
that we need to be worried about?

28:53.800 --> 28:59.710
Um, you texted me after I told you
about the police interviewing me.

28:59.760 --> 29:05.030
- Oh, you are joking!
Jesus, Colin! - No!

29:05.080 --> 29:07.230
OK. Look.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.470
She's a smack addict.

29:09.520 --> 29:13.710
Chances are, ten minutes after she
nicked it, she sold it for 20 quid.

29:13.760 --> 29:17.060
Chances are, we will be fine.

29:17.110 --> 29:19.030
- Daddy!...
- OK?

29:19.080 --> 29:23.200
I think it's all going to
be absolutely fine. Coming!

29:27.800 --> 29:30.470
- How?
- I'm not sure.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.230
I guess he must have heard us last night.

29:32.280 --> 29:34.430
You know, told someone, who told someone.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.350
I think the school might know as well.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.140
So we'll have to tell the other two.

29:55.880 --> 30:00.710
My colleague, DI Khan, is
speaking to Mrs Halcross again now.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.870
But from the conversation
we've already had with her,

30:03.920 --> 30:05.910
we're fairly confident

30:05.960 --> 30:09.200
that we're talking about the
indecent assault of a child under 13.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.550
If this is true, I promise you,

30:15.600 --> 30:19.000
I knew nothing, absolutely
nothing about it.

30:20.880 --> 30:25.070
Which is why I know you'll want
to help us as much as you can.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.870
You don't need to use that,

30:26.920 --> 30:29.350
that voice we use to make
them think we're their friend.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.270
I'll tell you what I know
because I'm a decent person,

30:32.320 --> 30:34.860
not because I think you like me.

30:37.440 --> 30:42.160
When we first met, you mentioned
that David did some voluntary work.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.500
What sort of stuff exactly?

30:51.120 --> 30:53.990
He worked at our local hospital,

30:54.040 --> 30:57.120
and at a nearby reform school.

31:04.360 --> 31:07.680
He did stuff for a local
children's charity.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.940
I'm going to need an exact list, please.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.190
Names of the institutions, and dates.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.510
And the... the timeline I asked for,

31:20.560 --> 31:24.150
detailing your movements in
the days before his death.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.070
Jason, Jason -- no!

31:27.580 --> 31:31.410
- No, he was in tears afterwards.
- 'Ah. Good.'

31:31.460 --> 31:34.020
He was incredibly apologetic.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.810
I just think he's got enough
crap to deal with right now.

31:38.860 --> 31:42.370
- 'Assaulting a police officer...'
- It wasn't an assault.

31:42.420 --> 31:44.770
- It's a serious offence, guv.
- 'No, it was an accident.'

31:44.820 --> 31:46.970
'He was... highly emotional.'

31:47.020 --> 31:49.730
'I don't care whether it
was an accident or not!'

31:49.780 --> 31:51.370
Then fine.

31:51.420 --> 31:55.170
Let's just hope he doesn't go on
to do something more serious, eh?

31:55.220 --> 32:00.170
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- 'Night.'

32:00.220 --> 32:01.940
Grub's up.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.900
What is it?

32:18.780 --> 32:21.610
You're drying up. What is it you want?

32:21.660 --> 32:24.530
Just thought it might make you smile.

32:24.580 --> 32:26.290
Cos you haven't, in a while.

32:26.340 --> 32:29.540
- That's rubbish. I smile loads.
- Do you?

32:31.060 --> 32:33.610
Well, I would, if you two
didn't spend half your lives

32:33.660 --> 32:35.450
trying to drive me round the bloody bend.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.220
We don't do it deliberately.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.480
I'm sorry, Gem. It's just...

32:45.220 --> 32:48.170
I've worked hard, and I'm tired.

32:48.220 --> 32:50.210
Do you want us to stay
at Mum's this weekend,

32:50.260 --> 32:53.340
- give you some time off?
- No.

32:53.980 --> 32:55.900
Not at all.

33:07.500 --> 33:11.300
We thought we'd tell you the truth
before you heard it anywhere else.

33:11.660 --> 33:14.730
I'll speak to the school tomorrow,
and let them know what's happened.

33:14.780 --> 33:17.770
What are my friends gonna say?

33:17.820 --> 33:20.850
It might be an idea for you
to take a few days off,

33:20.900 --> 33:23.250
till things blow over.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.210
You know the way I feel with it, Ali?

33:25.260 --> 33:28.450
I just see that woman
as a different person.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.530
Sara Alazi was not your mum.

33:31.580 --> 33:35.610
Sara Mahmoud is who she is.

33:35.660 --> 33:38.690
Your lovely mum, my lovely wife.

33:38.740 --> 33:41.410
- They'll rip the piss out of me!
- Ali, there's no need to swear.

33:41.460 --> 33:44.860
- It's disgusting! Disgusting!
- Sweetheart, please. I'm sorry.

33:45.460 --> 33:47.730
- Get off me!
- Ali, stop it.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.820
Get off me!

34:04.140 --> 34:06.930
- What the hell have you done?
- Don't blame me. - You told everyone!

34:06.980 --> 34:09.130
She's the one who did
it in the first place!

34:09.179 --> 34:11.370
- She? Who the hell's SHE?
- Leave me alone!

34:11.420 --> 34:14.780
- That's your mother!
- Ahmed! Shush! Calm down.

34:18.580 --> 34:20.580
So where is he now?

34:21.780 --> 34:23.690
Egham. They moved there from Winchester.

34:23.739 --> 34:27.610
- But you've not been there?
- Not yet.

34:27.659 --> 34:29.810
So you are planning to go?

34:29.860 --> 34:31.580
Yes.

34:33.699 --> 34:36.699
And what are you planning on
saying when you go to Egham?

34:37.380 --> 34:41.820
With his wife there, who probably
never knew anything about it either?

34:42.780 --> 34:46.409
I'll wait, till he goes
outside on his own.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.860
Right. What, and follow him?

34:51.060 --> 34:52.929
OK.

34:52.980 --> 34:55.250
And then what, Shoestring?

34:56.100 --> 34:59.620
- I'll introduce myself.
- Mm. Mm.

35:00.980 --> 35:02.890
So talk me through that.

35:02.940 --> 35:08.410
"Hi, I'm Martin. You had sex
with my wife 20 years ago --

35:08.460 --> 35:12.050
I just wondered if we could chat."

35:12.100 --> 35:16.490
That is probably borderline
illegal, what you're doing, anyway,

35:16.540 --> 35:19.650
and I can't imagine for one second
it's going to make you feel better.

35:19.700 --> 35:25.770
I mean, he's rich, and
hilarious, and supersmart.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.730
Does that make you feel better?

35:27.780 --> 35:33.450
Or he's a horrible runty
little goblin with halitosis.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
Does that?

35:37.420 --> 35:40.490
Or he's ordinary. Like you. Like me.

35:42.820 --> 35:44.610
Don't make a joke of
it, please, with Adam.

35:44.660 --> 35:47.170
- What do you mean, a joke?
- You do that sometimes.

35:47.220 --> 35:48.890
You find everything funny.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.940
I absolutely do not.

35:53.780 --> 35:56.060
- Hey, guys. - Hi. - Hi.

36:00.820 --> 36:04.780
- What happened to your face?
- Oh, it's a, it's a work thing.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.770
Granddad, have you been beating Mum again?

36:10.820 --> 36:14.570
Not yet, but give it a few days.
She's a cheeky little sod.

36:14.620 --> 36:19.970
Right. Beer. And you can
make an old man very happy

36:20.020 --> 36:22.820
by telling him about your girlfriend.

36:29.380 --> 36:32.050
I have to put my child first, Tess.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.660
I know you'll understand that.

36:42.540 --> 36:45.450
He'd never hurt Becca. He loves her.

36:45.500 --> 36:48.930
I'm not really talking
about physical violence.

36:48.980 --> 36:51.620
No... No, no, Paul.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.940
She's 15.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.330
How can you even begin to...

36:58.380 --> 37:02.370
You clearly had no idea what
sort of person your husband was.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.420
Why should it be any different with Jason?

37:07.820 --> 37:11.340
- Cos I'm his mother.
- And he's his father's son.

37:13.580 --> 37:15.930
I'm sorry. I really am.

37:15.980 --> 37:19.500
But Becca's my only concern right now.

37:21.460 --> 37:23.460
I'll call you.

37:25.540 --> 37:28.420
I'll be staying at my sister's for now.

37:28.740 --> 37:32.020
I just need a little time to
work out what's best for us all.

37:34.660 --> 37:36.780
I do love you.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.700
Sara?

38:13.620 --> 38:15.460
Sara!

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
Sara, are you there?

38:22.820 --> 38:24.770
Can you hear me, Sara?

38:24.820 --> 38:26.410
I just want you to know,

38:26.460 --> 38:29.370
we're all here for you
if you want to talk.

38:29.420 --> 38:31.980
Any of you.

38:45.460 --> 38:49.450
Well, yes. There were some rumours,

38:49.500 --> 38:54.570
about how Mr Walker was with
some of the kids on the ward.

38:54.620 --> 38:57.820
Personally, I never saw
anything, of course.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.740
Of course.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.580
Yeah. Quinn.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.090
Yeah, that's right.

39:06.140 --> 39:09.850
She was released as part of
the Good Friday agreement.

39:09.900 --> 39:14.940
We are looking for any kind
of address after December '99.

39:16.140 --> 39:18.010
We'll be grateful.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.930
It was a kids' charity, and
Walker was a volunteer.

39:25.980 --> 39:28.770
Well, we did have suspicions about him,

39:28.820 --> 39:31.570
but obviously I didn't
know anything for sure,

39:31.620 --> 39:34.180
or I would have reported it.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.860
Obviously.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.930
How was your mum?

39:56.980 --> 39:59.530
Irritating.

39:59.580 --> 40:02.450
- Any word from Zoe?
- Yeah. She's texted her parents.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.490
She's fine, but, um,

40:04.540 --> 40:06.890
well, she's two days now
without any care, so...

40:06.940 --> 40:08.610
What about us?

40:10.580 --> 40:14.170
I don't know. That's up to you,
I suppose. If you can forgive me.

40:14.220 --> 40:17.700
No, Maz. It isn't up to me.

40:18.660 --> 40:21.250
Because ever since I've known you,

40:21.300 --> 40:24.580
there's been this great
big wall around you.

40:25.020 --> 40:28.720
It's always stopped me
getting past a certain point.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.930
And the simple fact is,

40:30.980 --> 40:33.940
that if you want us to survive...

40:35.820 --> 40:38.290
.. you've got to take it down.

40:48.380 --> 40:53.450
- Mr Osborne. Mr Osborne?
Mr Osborne! - Sorry?

40:53.500 --> 40:55.210
Your daughter's school called.

40:55.260 --> 40:58.770
You were meant to pick her up an hour ago.

40:58.820 --> 41:03.940
Oh! Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

41:18.580 --> 41:20.860
Hey, you!

41:21.500 --> 41:24.690
I'm so, so sorry!

41:40.300 --> 41:42.490
Yes, I was at that reform school.

41:42.540 --> 41:45.690
Yes, we all knew what David Walker was.

41:45.740 --> 41:50.010
But we were kids who'd broken the law.

41:50.060 --> 41:53.930
Who was ever going to
believe a word we said?

41:53.980 --> 41:57.210
The truth is, a lot of
them didn't mind anyway,

41:57.260 --> 42:04.140
cos if they got friendly with
him, did want he wanted...

42:06.340 --> 42:09.620
.. they'd get invited to the gatherings.

42:10.700 --> 42:12.460
The gatherings?

42:29.660 --> 42:31.530
Sinead Quinn?

42:31.580 --> 42:33.330
You're a hard woman to find.

42:33.380 --> 42:38.210
DC Fran Lingley. I wonder if you
spare me five minutes of your time?

42:38.260 --> 42:40.330
- He just got his days mixed up.
- What I would say is,

42:40.380 --> 42:42.210
if you felt a family session could help...

42:42.260 --> 42:45.050
.. to talk about time management...

42:45.100 --> 42:46.930
Yeah, absolutely. Great idea.

42:46.980 --> 42:49.090
Do you need to get that?

42:49.140 --> 42:52.090
Yeah, sorry. That's probably him
on his way back home with Flora.

42:52.140 --> 42:54.650
'No problem. I'll get you get
off, and tell him not to worry.'

42:54.700 --> 42:56.890
- 'We've all been there.'
- Great. Thank you, Janet.

42:56.940 --> 43:00.210
- Speak tomorrow.
- 'OK, great. Bye.'

43:00.260 --> 43:03.170
- Hello?
- 'Is that Simon?'

43:03.220 --> 43:06.220
- Who's that?
- It's Tyler. How are you doing?

43:08.300 --> 43:11.410
- What do you want?
- Straight to the point. I like that.

43:11.460 --> 43:14.370
And since you ask, what
we want is 20 grand,

43:14.420 --> 43:16.010
or we'll tell social services

43:16.060 --> 43:19.100
about your husband being interviewed
in connection with a murder.

43:21.420 --> 43:24.130
Our witness, Ellen Harriet Price,

43:24.180 --> 43:27.530
told us that a number of
these... gatherings took place

43:27.580 --> 43:30.650
between 1981 and 1983.

43:30.700 --> 43:32.770
They were held at a house in Brentford,

43:32.820 --> 43:37.610
and Walker was a regular, as
were a number of other men,

43:37.660 --> 43:39.490
from various walks of life.

43:39.540 --> 43:44.050
But most importantly, they were
also regularly attended by children

43:44.100 --> 43:47.610
from local care homes, local
Borstals and the streets.

43:47.660 --> 43:52.170
Now, these vulnerable kids were
plied with drink, and offered drugs,

43:52.220 --> 43:55.900
and then, on a number of
occasions, sexually assaulted.

43:57.140 --> 44:00.490
Now, I think we need to
consider the possibility

44:00.540 --> 44:03.890
that one of these people
was taken to this house,

44:03.940 --> 44:05.970
assaulted by Walker,

44:06.020 --> 44:08.850
and then, eight or nine years later,

44:08.900 --> 44:11.450
they've come across him again
and decided to take revenge.

44:11.500 --> 44:15.380
The question is, which?

44:18.580 --> 44:21.290
The IRA wouldn't have touched
her with a shitty stick.

44:21.340 --> 44:24.210
- Right. - She was a
messed-up, middle-class kid

44:24.260 --> 44:26.650
wanting to piss off Mummy and Daddy.

44:26.700 --> 44:30.770
In fact, her commitment to the cause
was pretty accurately demonstrated

44:30.820 --> 44:34.220
when the police knocked on her
door about me a few years later.

44:36.980 --> 44:40.580
Did you ever see her with this man?

44:45.980 --> 44:47.810
No.

44:47.860 --> 44:50.570
But she showed me a photo of him once.

44:50.620 --> 44:53.010
Really?

44:53.060 --> 44:55.490
- This man? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

44:55.540 --> 44:57.130
In what context?

44:57.180 --> 45:00.130
She said he worked for the Tories,
had connections with Thatcher.

45:00.180 --> 45:02.490
She thought he was a potential target.

45:02.540 --> 45:04.890
Target?

45:04.940 --> 45:08.570
We weren't interested. Too small-time.

45:08.620 --> 45:13.170
But aye, she wanted us to kill him.
