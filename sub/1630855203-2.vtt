WEBVTT

00:56.680 --> 00:59.880
Morning.
Morning.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.360
Ah, I had really weird dreams
about Mum last night...

01:07.440 --> 01:08.560
..in this bed.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.200
She was in here, but with a horse.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.360
And the horse was...
reading a newspaper.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.320
Do you think she...

01:23.240 --> 01:24.759
..did it...

01:24.760 --> 01:27.199
in here... with him?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.679
"Did it"?
Well, what would you say?

01:29.680 --> 01:33.519
"Made love."
Ugh, no, God, no.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.560
Well, you asked.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.840
It's just...

01:38.440 --> 01:40.040
..well, what about Dad?

01:41.120 --> 01:44.080
I just need to get this part
of the tender over for ten.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.359
I thought we'd won something.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.640
Turns out we've missed a whole bit
of due diligence.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.119
CAT MEOWS
Can you hear something?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.359
I'm gonna find a cafe,
the reception here's useless.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.039
It'd be easier
to send a carrier pigeon.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.680
Do you want some breakfast?
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.399
Must be nice
just having to sort yourself out.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.919
Why, what are you doing
that's so pressing?

02:11.920 --> 02:14.439
No, no, I just, I mean in general.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.319
I know what you mean.
CAT MEOWS

02:16.320 --> 02:17.840
Can you hear that?

02:19.040 --> 02:20.399
CAT MEOWS
Yeah, it's a cat.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.799
Yeah, but I think it's coming from
in here.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.120
CAT MEOWS

02:25.760 --> 02:28.519
I'll get the bags from the B&B
and bring them back here, shall I?

02:28.520 --> 02:30.319
No point in paying for somewhere.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.440
Yeah, good idea.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.759
Hey, hello.
SMACKS LIPS

02:35.760 --> 02:37.840
I don't think you live here,
do you?

02:39.520 --> 02:41.760
Oh... Oh.
CAT MEOWS

02:44.400 --> 02:46.039
Oh, what have you done?
That looks sore.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.800
That's a Manx cat,
they don't have tails.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.479
She didn't like cats.
Well, it may not be her cat.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.800
Well, that's her bloody cat bowl,
though, innit?

02:56.880 --> 02:58.440
CAT MEOWS

03:05.080 --> 03:07.879
FUNERAL DIRECTOR: Any thoughts
on who you'd like

03:07.880 --> 03:09.280
to conduct the service?

03:11.880 --> 03:14.239
Oh, she wasn't religious, really.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.960
Weddings and christenings.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.000
OK, well,
I'm sure we can help with that.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.519
Any songs or readings
that were her favourite?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.560
We stopped listening to music.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.079
Well... I did.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.520
She always had her earphones on,
listening to...

03:36.880 --> 03:38.240
..podcasts and whatnot.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.080
Well, if anything comes to you,
just let me know.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.480
I should have asked these things.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.680
It's very common for these
conversations to not take place.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.880
It's not something
everyone likes talking about.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.120
Yeah, but you never really
know someone, do you?

04:05.160 --> 04:07.759
I mean, you know the stuff
they choose to show you,

04:07.760 --> 04:09.759
and the stuff you choose
to listen to.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.000
But all the rest of it...

04:14.720 --> 04:16.960
..they can just carry it around
in their head.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.600
How are you, Mum?
BECCA: 'I'm OK. How are you?'

04:23.600 --> 04:25.119
Yeah, good.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.639
So, do you know
why Gran was there yet?

04:27.640 --> 04:28.720
I think she just...

04:29.880 --> 04:31.760
..fancied a little trip for herself.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.759
How's your dad?

04:34.760 --> 04:37.999
Yeah, he's good.
He worked the washer.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.360
'Medal's in the post (!)

04:40.960 --> 04:44.599
'How's Mol? I tried calling her,
but she's not picking up.'

04:44.600 --> 04:45.839
Oh, she's fine.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.760
'You need to stop worrying.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.639
'Are you OK, Mum?'

04:50.640 --> 04:52.400
Yes, I'm fine.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.319
'Listen, I've got to go. I'm gonna
be late for work, but...

04:56.320 --> 04:57.360
'love you.'

04:58.400 --> 04:59.520
I love you, darling.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.519
Yes, Nick.
I've got that on the third line.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.799
Hiya.
Hi.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.239
Um, listen, Nick,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.199
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm interrupting.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.240
No, it's fine.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.520
I've never milked an oat.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.439
Milked many cows?

05:25.440 --> 05:29.200
Yes, actually, I have.
I was raised on a farm.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.319
Where was the farm?

05:32.320 --> 05:34.199
Fischer, Texas.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.240
Not a lot of traffic through there.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.360
Kind of like here.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.399
What brought you here, then?

05:41.400 --> 05:43.119
A man.
Oh, really?

05:43.120 --> 05:46.519
No, I liked England
and I like Ireland.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.840
And I thought, "Well, this is like
somewhere in between."

05:49.840 --> 05:51.320
And is it?
Not at all.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.200
No, it's, uh...

05:56.360 --> 05:57.759
..it's its own place, you know.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.359
It's unique.
Unique good?

06:00.360 --> 06:04.319
Most of the time. Small.
I like that.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.760
Look, your business is never
gonna be your own for very long.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.320
We know about Pete.
Oh, you do?

06:16.760 --> 06:19.200
Was it a full-on affair?

06:20.520 --> 06:23.079
Well, they weren't exactly
Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara,

06:23.080 --> 06:25.080
but they were sweet on each other.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.080
So, what's he like? Pete?

06:31.120 --> 06:33.080
Uh, verbose.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.000
A hugger.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.599
He's a bit of a prig.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.639
SHE SPLUTTERS
Hey, I said prig!

06:41.640 --> 06:44.279
THEY LAUGH

06:44.280 --> 06:47.639
No, he's fine. He's fine.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.479
He's just... He must have done
something fancy

06:50.480 --> 06:51.759
before he retired.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.959
You know, he's the kind of guy

06:52.960 --> 06:55.319
that no-one ever told him
his shit stinks.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.360
Right?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.159
Yep.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.519
Recognise that type.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.840
Oh, oh, God bless him.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.399
Rebecca.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.520
I know you were having an affair
with my mum.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.600
Oh.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.399
"Oh"? Is that all you've got to say?

07:43.400 --> 07:48.360
No, I've got a lot to say, actually,
if you'll let me.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.320
Let me make you some tea at least.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.040
Come in, please.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.760
So, who was she? My mum.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.839
Like, really?

08:04.840 --> 08:09.919
Oh, she was charming, thoughtful,
funny as hell.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.479
Mum?
Oh, that doesn't ring a bell?

08:12.480 --> 08:15.799
No! Well, "funny"
wouldn't be the first word

08:15.800 --> 08:17.159
that would leap to mind.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.520
What would be the first word?

08:20.080 --> 08:22.479
"Normal."
Oh, Lord!

08:22.480 --> 08:26.120
God save us from the tyranny
of normality.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.279
What's your sister think
about all of this?

08:29.280 --> 08:31.400
Oh, she's horrified.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.559
Had my mother pegged
as a living saint.

08:34.560 --> 08:35.600
Oh.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.719
It isn't easy being a sister.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.800
I say that from experience.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.719
The world expects you
to have this great deep bond

08:45.720 --> 08:49.319
and my sister was a pain in the ass,
God rest her soul.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.159
I'm sorry.
No, no, it wasn't her fault.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.599
My mother babied me,
and she was a bitch about it.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.679
Hm.

08:54.680 --> 08:58.999
Well, that's about $10,000 worth of
psychotherapy right there, isn't it?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.159
Well, my mum definitely believed in
horses for courses.

09:02.160 --> 09:05.200
And you got the steeple chase.
Yeah.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.680
She treat you girls differently?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.480
You could say.
Hm.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.119
Well... what would you need
to know about your mother

09:18.120 --> 09:19.600
that might help you, Ros?

09:23.760 --> 09:24.800
I don't know.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.960
She wanted you to know.

09:39.720 --> 09:44.680
She wanted to show you the island,
the life that she'd chosen.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.760
It's nice she thought
she had a choice.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.400
She didn't think to tell my dad,
though.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.360
My dad knew?

09:56.600 --> 09:57.680
No, he didn't.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.839
My dad loved my mum.
I don't doubt that he did.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.000
You loved her better, did you?
No...

10:06.800 --> 10:10.000
..I just loved her, that's all.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.560
So... what did you do together?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.559
What did you talk about?

10:25.560 --> 10:29.039
We had a...
a shared love of history...

10:29.040 --> 10:31.360
of music... literature.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.400
What literature?

10:34.960 --> 10:37.560
Emily Bronte, Wuthering Heights.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.839
Edna O'Brien.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.280
Maeve Binchy? Jackie Collins?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.359
This is...
So, what was her plan, long term?

10:47.360 --> 10:49.999
She was just gonna busk it
and wait for my dad to die?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.040
Or she just saw it as a...

10:53.720 --> 10:55.599
..dirty secret?

10:55.600 --> 10:57.879
No... No.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.120
It really wasn't like that.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.719
She wanted to make the move here
permanently.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.799
No, she didn't.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.519
Becca, please,
what I'm saying is the truth.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.479
And you must hear me
because this is important.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.239
She was happy here... really happy.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.319
She told me that
if anything were to happen to her...

11:15.320 --> 11:17.479
she wanted to remain here.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.520
No.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.520
She's coming home.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.999
I don't even know who you are,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.759
you're just some bloke
who found her dead.

11:26.760 --> 11:27.919
You don't know her.

11:27.920 --> 11:31.440
Becca, please... I know her.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.279
She went to Flixton High School
for girls.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.319
Her first job was at
Metropolitan-Vickers near Ringway,

11:41.320 --> 11:43.319
in the accounts department.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.719
She wanted to write,

11:45.720 --> 11:48.119
but she thought that writing
wasn't for people like her,

11:48.120 --> 11:52.240
so she wrote in secret,
and she wrote beautifully.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.999
I would love you to see
some of her writing.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.519
No.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.679
Becca. Becca, please.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.640
You must understand that
I cared very deeply for your mother.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.640
DOOR SLAMS

12:19.400 --> 12:20.880
Your bag's in the kitchen.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.480
I went to see Pete.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.359
And?

12:28.360 --> 12:30.600
She was happy here, apparently.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.959
And, um, you're gonna like this (!)

12:33.960 --> 12:36.960
It was her wish
to stay on the island.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.040
And she can stay here
for all I care.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.239
You don't mean that.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.320
PHONE BUZZES

12:52.760 --> 12:53.920
Hello?

13:04.480 --> 13:06.640
We've had the results
from the postmortem.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.639
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

13:09.640 --> 13:12.560
but your mother had consumed
a lethal amount of morphine.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.400
What?

13:17.680 --> 13:18.920
How could that have happened?

13:22.880 --> 13:24.520
Are you saying our mother...

13:26.800 --> 13:28.919
..took her own life?

13:28.920 --> 13:31.760
I'm sorry,
but it does look that way.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.359
Morphine? What...?

13:39.360 --> 13:42.479
How was it taken? When was it taken?

13:42.480 --> 13:44.919
The coroner will deliver all this
in her findings

13:44.920 --> 13:46.799
once all the information
has been gathered.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.919
Well, you need to get it gathered.
What else is there?

13:48.920 --> 13:50.279
That's what they're trying to do.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.199
Was she taking it for pain relief,
have you at least established that?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.719
We're still awaiting
her medical records from the UK.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.999
Are they coming on horseback?
I'll call the doctor's.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.439
Who gave it to her?

13:59.440 --> 14:00.959
Oh, she just took it herself,
did she?

14:00.960 --> 14:03.159
Dead woman OD'd on morphine,
case closed. Is that it?

14:03.160 --> 14:05.079
Why am I the one
asking all the questions?

14:05.080 --> 14:08.399
We are doing everything we can.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.880
Can you tell
if she took it on purpose?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.639
I mean,
how can you even know for certain?

14:13.640 --> 14:17.279
The amount in her stomach suggests
that it was taken in one go

14:17.280 --> 14:19.000
with the purpose of ending her life.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.159
The toxicology reports
we're awaiting on,

14:22.160 --> 14:25.759
hair strand testing, will show us if
there was a history of use or abuse,

14:25.760 --> 14:27.519
although there were no signs
of any illness

14:27.520 --> 14:29.639
that would support the need
for morphine use.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.799
Uh, and when will you get
these reports?

14:31.800 --> 14:35.199
Er, in the next day or two.
And what if someone gave it to her?

14:35.200 --> 14:37.359
We've followed up
all lines of inquiry

14:37.360 --> 14:39.999
and we have no reason to believe
that anyone else was involved.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.800
And you're not interested
in where she got the morphine from?

14:48.600 --> 14:52.039
Ms Ward, we are following all leads.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.079
When we have a clearer picture
we'll be able to say

14:54.080 --> 14:56.039
if there's cause
for a criminal investigation.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.919
At the moment, it's...
Right. Yeah, thank you.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.400
..a matter for the coroner.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.720
Was she taking morphine
cos there was something wrong?

15:23.240 --> 15:26.160
Was it too much for her, being here?
Lying?

15:28.240 --> 15:29.280
Becca?

15:31.080 --> 15:33.920
What do you think?
I don't know.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.360
Well, you don't have to know,
but you must have an opinion.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.680

I found some things out about Mum.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.880

16:11.960 --> 16:13.519
She was having an affair.

16:13.520 --> 16:17.239
'An affair?
Oh, Mary, you dark horse.'

16:17.240 --> 16:19.080
No, not dark horse.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.279

I'm all ears, go on.'

No, it's fine. I'm gonna go.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.120
This lot can go to a charity shop.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.680

Nope.

Better?
Mm.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.000
How's life on the island going?

20:09.760 --> 20:10.880
Well...

20:13.720 --> 20:15.719
..me mother was living a double life

20:15.720 --> 20:18.919
and, it would seem, killed herself.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.799
And my sister's abdicated
all responsibility.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.640
So just dandy.
Oh.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.320
Sorry. That's a lot.
Mm.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.720
My mother... of all people.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.200
Topped herself.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.680
Were you close?

20:45.240 --> 20:46.360
Not massively.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.919
I mean, we pretended we were,
cos that's what you do...

20:49.920 --> 20:52.119
Mm.
..but we weren't.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.960
I was the same. My mum was tricky...

20:57.800 --> 21:00.119
..but it still hit me
like a ton of bricks when she died,

21:00.120 --> 21:01.600

something, like... an overdose.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.720
Yeah, I had a... police officer
come round, say t'same thing.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.999
What, you knew?
'Well...

23:39.000 --> 23:41.520

daft claims. Load of nonsense.'

in her stomach.'

23:57.000 --> 23:58.280
We're working on it.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.079
Dad, could you maybe go round
to Jim's?

24:01.080 --> 24:02.440

24:04.360 --> 24:06.039

24:06.040 --> 24:07.920
Yeah, I don't really like you
being on your own.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.680

So I'd better get used to it.

Well, we haven't...

24:43.440 --> 24:45.719
haven't all got time
to go swanning round the island

No.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.999
I just wanna talk to them,
tell them about Mum.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.999
See if there's anything they know.
I don't wanna talk to those people.

..Mum... took an overdose
of morphine.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.960

No.

ROSALINE: Do you know why?

25:38.040 --> 25:39.160
Pete?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.119
Rosaline would like to know

25:42.120 --> 25:45.000
if there's any reason why her mother
would've taken her own life.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.880
Your mother was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.080

26:04.760 --> 26:08.920
Erm, you need to tell me everything.
This is everything.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.839
Why would she take her own life?

26:12.840 --> 26:16.320

YOU talked to her all the time.

with Alzheimer's?

26:29.080 --> 26:30.840
PETE SIGHS
A year ago.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.520
She started forgetting things.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.840
Oh, you must have realised that
when you talked to her.

26:40.040 --> 26:43.640
Yes, but, well,
she's always been forgetful.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.959
She said she wanted to put the worry
out of her mind

26:46.960 --> 26:49.120
and get on with her life.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.360
So, she got tested...

26:52.680 --> 26:55.119
..and the results
were not what she wanted.

26:55.120 --> 27:00.399
I told her when the time came,
I'd look after her.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.279
So she said nothing
to either of you

27:02.280 --> 27:05.399
about not wanting to be here
any more?

27:05.400 --> 27:06.600
Nothing.

But if she was here
and she was your friend,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.759
and she was your lover,
she must have said something.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.279
There must have been some clue.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.079
I mean,
when was the last time you saw her?

27:19.080 --> 27:20.840
What did you do? What did she say?

27:21.880 --> 27:25.960
Five days ago, we had a picnic.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.520
Went out for a drive. We...

27:32.920 --> 27:35.320
We had a perfect day.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.680

32:16.600 --> 32:17.840
BARMAN: All right.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.519
I spoke to Dad.
Without me?

32:25.520 --> 32:27.560
I just felt he needed telling.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.879
Anyway, he didn't need telling.
He already knew.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.600
About the morphine?

32:35.400 --> 32:40.160
Or the adoption? Or the Alzheimer's?
Or the affair?

32:41.640 --> 32:42.880
BARMAN: There you go.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.559
You've had affairs with married men,
haven't you?

32:56.560 --> 32:58.039
Thank you. Yes, I have.

32:58.040 --> 33:02.400
Well, tell me, does it add to the...
of it all?

33:03.720 --> 33:06.359
No.
Well, it must do.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.719
It's not like that.
Well, what is it like, then, mm?

33:08.720 --> 33:10.719
Tell me.
No. Why not?

33:10.720 --> 33:13.120
Because it'll make me
feel like shit.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.680
HOST: One, two. You getting that?

33:23.080 --> 33:24.640
SHE SIGHS

33:32.640 --> 33:35.320
Hi.
Hi.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.040
What's your name?
SHE CHUCKLES

33:40.160 --> 33:42.680
Becca.
Becca.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.159
HOST: Right, who's next?
MAN: Do I go?

33:46.160 --> 33:47.999
Oh, no, no, no. Not you lot.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.399
You're hogging it.
Give someone else a chance.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.879
Becca.
Oh, no.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.119
HOST: Come on.
Yeah.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.919
BECCA LAUGHS
Come on. Come on.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.720
OLLIE LAUGHS

33:59.800 --> 34:01.319
Ooh.

34:01.320 --> 34:06.079
SONG: 'It's Oh So Quiet'

34:06.080 --> 34:11.560
BECCA: # Shh
It's oh so quiet

34:15.840 --> 34:18.599
# It's oh so still... #

34:18.600 --> 34:22.799
Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit!

34:22.800 --> 34:25.239
# All alone... #

34:25.240 --> 34:26.559
ROSALINE: Oh, for God's sake!

34:26.560 --> 34:27.639
TOILET FLUSHES

34:27.640 --> 34:31.919
# And so peaceful until

34:31.920 --> 34:36.079
# You fall in love
Zing, boom

34:36.080 --> 34:39.719
# The sky up above
Zing, boom

34:39.720 --> 34:43.479
# Is caving in
Wow, bam

34:43.480 --> 34:46.399
# You've never
Been so nuts about a guy

34:46.400 --> 34:48.479
# You wanna laugh
You wanna cry

34:48.480 --> 34:50.879
# You cross your heart
And hope to die

34:50.880 --> 34:52.079
# Till it's over... #

34:52.080 --> 34:53.959
That's enough, Becca, let's go.
No.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.119
You can have a drink at home.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.839
I'm staying. Shh.
No, you're not, come on.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.599
Shh! Are you the only one
who's allowed to have any fun?

34:59.600 --> 35:01.479
Is this fun?
Yes, actually.

35:01.480 --> 35:02.919
If you don't wanna be here, go home.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.159
I'm not leaving you here.
Well, I'm not coming with you.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.919
So either join in,
sit there with a face...

35:06.920 --> 35:09.319
You know what, just go home.
And what about Jim?

35:09.320 --> 35:11.559
I only sat on his knee.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.879
What's up?
Is he not married enough for you?

35:13.880 --> 35:16.599
You're a dick. Do what you like.

35:16.600 --> 35:20.839
# You blow a fuse
Zing, boom

35:20.840 --> 35:24.639
# The devil cuts loose
Zing, boom

35:24.640 --> 35:28.039
# So what's the use
Wow, bam

35:28.040 --> 35:30.520
# Of falling in love? #

35:36.040 --> 35:37.120
Agh!

35:38.920 --> 35:40.559
Jim, it's Rosaline.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.959
I'm sorry for calling so late,
but I'm worried about Becca.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.919
She's...

35:44.920 --> 35:47.000
Anyway, call me back when you can.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.000
SHE SIGHS

35:58.400 --> 36:00.879
Mm. Bums up.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.040
SHE LAUGHS

36:03.880 --> 36:05.360
Oh!

36:13.400 --> 36:14.680
Oh!

36:15.880 --> 36:18.679
BOTH LAUGH

36:18.680 --> 36:20.080
Oh, my God!

36:32.240 --> 36:33.440
Hey.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.720
Just can't go back to that house.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.720
Come in.

36:59.920 --> 37:04.159
Oh, hi. It's Rosaline Ward.
Erm, just calling to see

37:04.160 --> 37:07.440
if there'd been any results back
from my biopsy.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.240
Yeah. Yes, of course.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.240
Thank you.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.160
HE CLEARS THROAT

37:23.440 --> 37:26.720
Morning.
Morning.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.400
Thank you so much for...
Oh, no bother.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.120
I wonder how your sister's head is
this morning.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.360
Better go and check on her.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.919
Coffee?

37:45.920 --> 37:48.320
Yeah, great.
OK.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.200
PHONE BUZZES

37:59.480 --> 38:02.160
SHE SIGHS
Oh.

38:04.560 --> 38:08.480
Urgh. Jesus.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.880
SHE GRUNTS

38:31.480 --> 38:33.280
Oh, shit.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.039
JIM: 'Becca, Rosaline called me.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.040
'What the hell are you playing at?
Call me.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.319
'Becca. Where are you?
It's three in the morning.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.920
'I need you to call me.'

38:54.000 --> 38:55.759
Pfft.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.759
What about your dad?

38:57.760 --> 39:01.199
Yeah, he was OK.
Pipe and slippers man.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.120
Worked in finance here,
and I followed him into it.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.559
Wait, you worked in finance?
Can't you tell?

39:08.560 --> 39:10.919
I was a big hitter, me.
SHE LAUGHS

39:10.920 --> 39:12.080
HE CHUCKLES

39:14.520 --> 39:17.959
Do you have brothers and sisters?
Yeah, brother lives in Kirk Michael.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.879
We're close.
So, what about you and your sister?

39:20.880 --> 39:22.040
Oh!

39:23.760 --> 39:27.119
My therapist says we were forged
in the same fire.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.359
SHE SNORTS

39:28.360 --> 39:30.959
That's just therapy speak
for "grew up in the same house."

39:30.960 --> 39:32.159
You can live in the same house

39:32.160 --> 39:34.920
but have wildly different
experiences, can't you?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.319
ROSALINE SIGHS
Sorry.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.000
I didn't mean to upset you.

39:53.800 --> 39:54.960
I had cancer.

39:59.840 --> 40:04.120
Once when I was a teenager,
and then again about ten years ago.

40:08.520 --> 40:12.199
So, yeah,
we had wildly different experiences.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.320
I'm so sorry.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.440
It's OK.

40:17.800 --> 40:21.440
It's me mum. I mean...

40:24.640 --> 40:26.639
Oh, God,
this sounds so self-indulgent,

40:26.640 --> 40:30.680
but I know what it's like
to be poorly, you know?

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
You think life might get taken away
in a moment.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.400
How could she do what she did?

40:46.720 --> 40:48.519
I mean, so what?
She had Alzheimer's.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.360
Why did she get to just give up?
I didn't.

40:55.840 --> 40:57.880
And it's bloody hard to keep going.

41:11.440 --> 41:12.600
BECCA SIGHS

41:17.320 --> 41:20.519
How dare you interfere
in my marriage.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.280
What did you say to him?
I was worried about you.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.879
What were you playing at?
You look like shit.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.319
Don't judge me.

41:28.320 --> 41:32.799
Oh, it's OK for you
to judge me all of the time!

41:32.800 --> 41:34.999
We're not doing this.
We need to talk about Mum. No, no.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.919
When do I judge you?

41:36.920 --> 41:39.239
Asking me what it's like
to have affairs with married men.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.039
Pretending
it's just an innocent question,

41:41.040 --> 41:42.319
when it's all judgement.

41:42.320 --> 41:46.159
That isn't judgement, Rosaline.
That's called having an opinion.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.679
So you're allowed to have
a firm, out-loud opinion about that,

41:48.680 --> 41:51.319
but I couldn't mention your sham
of a marriage, for example.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.479
What does that mean?

41:52.480 --> 41:54.839
"Oh, look at us.
We had life sewn up at 18,

41:54.840 --> 41:56.759
"and we're gonna let you all
know about it."

41:56.760 --> 42:00.879
How have I got life sewn up?
I do everything in this family.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.279
Don't give me that!
What do you do?

42:02.280 --> 42:04.039
You just swan in
for high days and holidays.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.759
Don't give me that.
You love being needed.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.999
You always have.
It isn't being needed.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.999
It's called being an adult.
ROSALINE SCOFFS

42:10.000 --> 42:13.559
YELLS:
You're not an adult! You're 18.

42:13.560 --> 42:16.159
You're stuck in 1995,
when you got with Jim.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.639
You don't even put petrol
in your own car, for God's sake.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.839
"To the moon. To the moon." (!)

42:20.840 --> 42:23.040
Don't talk to me
about being an adult.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.039
I've got two teenage kids.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.959
Oh, there it is, the trump card.
You've got kids!

42:28.960 --> 42:31.839
Congratulations
on utilising your womb.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.559
You know, anyone would think
I had an easy life.

42:34.560 --> 42:35.839
Look, I never said that.

42:35.840 --> 42:39.999
You just think that I swanned off,
that my life was a bed of roses.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.439
You had everything.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.399
Everything was about you
when I was younger.

42:44.400 --> 42:47.159
No! I was sick. That's a given.

42:47.160 --> 42:49.879
But everything
was about you and Mum,

42:49.880 --> 42:51.439
your relationship.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.399
You used to whisper behind my back.

42:53.400 --> 42:56.599
No, she used to whisper to me
behind your back,

42:56.600 --> 42:59.479
because she didn't want
to upset you.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.079
I was 14!

43:01.080 --> 43:04.479
You loved it, being her favourite!
How was I her favourite?!

43:04.480 --> 43:06.399
You took
that bloody coffee bean necklace...

43:06.400 --> 43:08.519
Oh, my God!
..because you feel entitled to it.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.039
Have it. I don't want it. What,
you're throwing that in my face?

43:11.040 --> 43:12.599
And the minute
an affair's mentioned,

43:12.600 --> 43:13.959
you throw that in MY face.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.559
Because you think that I'm like Mum,
and I'm not. You are.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.759
Well, you might be right there,
cos this conversation

43:18.760 --> 43:20.280
is making me want
to kill myself!

43:27.320 --> 43:28.440
ROSALINE SCOFFS

43:32.920 --> 43:34.760
You know what?
You're gonna hear this.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.120
I wasn't her favourite. You were.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.999
Your life wasn't derailed,
but mine was,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.399
because you got to leave home at 18

43:44.400 --> 43:47.040
when she had
a full-on nervous breakdown.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.439
She didn't get out of bed
for months.

43:50.440 --> 43:53.159
Do you know how hard it is
to section someone?

43:53.160 --> 43:55.719
Mm? It's hard.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.439
Because she's not quite
a danger to herself,

43:58.440 --> 44:00.560
but she's pretty edgy all the same.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.039
I didn't know.
No, I know you didn't,

44:04.040 --> 44:05.559
because I wasn't allowed
to tell you,

44:05.560 --> 44:09.119
because you'd just got better
and you'd just gone to university,

44:09.120 --> 44:11.000
so I had to look after her.

44:12.520 --> 44:16.240
But what about Dad?
What about Dad?

44:18.680 --> 44:21.479
Did his best, but he...

44:21.480 --> 44:23.079
he had to go to work
and pay the mortgage.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.639
So I dropped out of college.

44:25.640 --> 44:28.279
No. You dropped out of college
to be with Jim.

44:28.280 --> 44:33.079
No. I got with Jim
BECAUSE I left college.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.479
No, no. You loved Jim.
Yes.

44:35.480 --> 44:38.279
But I could have loved
someone else.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.880
I could have loved SOMEWHERE else.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.160
I didn't know about any of this.

44:54.520 --> 44:55.760
Well, now you do.

45:03.680 --> 45:04.880
How bad was Mum?

45:11.840 --> 45:14.040
She was bad enough
to do something stupid.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.200
But she didn't...

45:18.120 --> 45:20.560
..because I was there,
and I could stop her.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.200
But I couldn't this time,
and now she's...
