11:28.084 --> 11:31.959
Obviously...they wrote
the date down wrong.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.167
Not gonna fly, mom.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.417
Not this time.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.000
Okay. Fine.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.042
Let's go.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.042
Where are we going?

11:56.375 --> 12:00.083
Your father...was a drug addict.

12:00.083 --> 12:04.125
A very dedicated,
very resourceful addict.

12:04.125 --> 12:07.625
And he spent a lot of time
in this neighborhood.

12:07.625 --> 12:08.917
Here?

12:10.458 --> 12:11.917
My dad.

12:13.291 --> 12:14.834
You were barely three

12:14.834 --> 12:16.500
and I'd leave you with him

12:16.500 --> 12:19.125
so that, uh..

12:19.125 --> 12:20.834
...I could go to work.

12:20.834 --> 12:24.417
And we didn't have money
for day care or babysitter.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.458
It was summer.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.625
Hottest day of the year.

12:28.625 --> 12:30.458
And I came home from work

12:30.458 --> 12:31.917
and you two were gone.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.667
No note, just empty apartment.

12:36.708 --> 12:39.084
I was worried, but I waited.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.500
'A half hour passed'

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
and...I couldn't
stand it anymore

12:43.500 --> 12:45.084
so I went out searching.

12:46.291 --> 12:48.084
And I came to this place.

12:49.041 --> 12:51.000
What made you look here?

12:52.542 --> 12:54.750
Experience.

12:54.750 --> 12:57.250
This woman, this junkie

12:57.250 --> 12:59.375
pointed me to that building.

12:59.375 --> 13:01.750
I ran inside and I heard you.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.959
I heard you calling out
somewhere above me.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.708
You were
wandering around all alone

13:08.708 --> 13:12.750
with needles and glass and..

13:12.750 --> 13:14.333
...God knows what else

13:14.333 --> 13:15.959
while your father..

13:18.542 --> 13:20.750
...was getting high
down the hall.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.209
'I grabbed you up..'

13:24.000 --> 13:26.417
...and I found Rex
and I shook him.

13:26.417 --> 13:31.000
And I told him,
"This will be the last time

13:31.000 --> 13:34.125
you will ever see us again."

13:35.834 --> 13:38.500
And his eyes were glassy,
so I don't know

13:38.500 --> 13:39.792
I don't know if he understood.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.792
but he did not
come home that night.

13:41.792 --> 13:44.000
'And he didn't come home
the next night.'

13:46.125 --> 13:49.291
And you started asking
where he was.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.125
And...I said he was gone.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.834
But you being you
just had to know where.

14:01.750 --> 14:05.167
So I said, I said heaven.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.834
You could have come clean.

14:10.625 --> 14:14.209
You...shouldn't really say that

14:14.209 --> 14:16.208
until you have been
in my position.

14:19.834 --> 14:21.834
It's a lot harder
than it sounds.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.291
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

14:33.084 --> 14:34.000
No.

14:39.209 --> 14:40.667
I'm sorry.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.042
(male #2)
'After each film screens,
you will be asked'

14:47.042 --> 14:49.291
to make a brief statement,
I mean brief, people.

14:49.291 --> 14:52.000
This is not your Oscar
acceptance speech.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.792
'You will tell us how your film'

14:53.792 --> 14:56.000
'represents your vision
as a filmmaker'

14:56.000 --> 14:58.917
and why we should
support that vision

14:58.917 --> 15:01.417
by accepting you
into Lancer's film program.

15:01.417 --> 15:04.250
After that, the admissions
committee will confer

15:04.250 --> 15:06.750
and our decisions will be made
by the end of the week.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.208
Any questions? Alright.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.542
I'll see you all tomorrow night.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.167
Break a leg.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.333
Hey.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.208
I'm, I'm Dan.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.458
Antigone.

15:21.458 --> 15:23.125
That wasn't so bad, right?

15:23.125 --> 15:24.417
What do you mean?

15:24.417 --> 15:25.875
I thought I was going
to leave this meeting

15:25.875 --> 15:27.458
more nervous than ever but..

15:27.458 --> 15:30.708
...after he went over
the judging criteria again

15:30.708 --> 15:32.208
I'm feeling pretty good.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.625
Lucky you.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.125
I mean, I can't seem
to get last year's

15:35.125 --> 15:36.875
applicant films out of my head.

15:36.875 --> 15:39.125
You know, they were so profound.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.500
And it just made me realize,
when the judges say

15:41.500 --> 15:43.667
they care about quote,
unquote "Story"

15:43.667 --> 15:44.708
what they're really
talking about

15:44.708 --> 15:46.167
is deep thematic resonance.

15:46.167 --> 15:48.875
And the film itself
to manifest as art.

15:48.875 --> 15:50.375
Thematic resonance, huh?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.667
I feel that my film
already has all that stuff

15:52.667 --> 15:55.041
but you never know.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.084
You mind telling us
what it's about?

15:57.084 --> 15:59.542
Well, I mean,
without getting too into it

15:59.542 --> 16:01.291
it's a meditation on identity.

16:01.291 --> 16:04.041
Identity, cool.
Selfdom versus conformity.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.041
I can totally see that working.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.917
I have to admit though,
I decided to just let go

16:08.917 --> 16:11.000
and enjoy doing
something I love.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.917
I'm a huge Dogme 95 fan.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.542
Lars Von Trier,
Thomas Vinterberg.

16:14.542 --> 16:16.000
No props, no artificial lighting

16:16.000 --> 16:17.417
no superficial action
like murders.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.959
Really forces you to focus
on the traditional values

16:19.959 --> 16:22.125
of story, acting and theme.

16:22.125 --> 16:25.042
So what's your film about, Dan?

16:25.042 --> 16:29.750
Um...you know, I don't want
to ruin the surprise.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.375
Come on, we told you ours.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.208
Uh, it's..

16:34.208 --> 16:37.417
It's got zombies, okay?

16:37.417 --> 16:41.542
Oh. So, it's like a genre film.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.750
Are the zombies metaphorical?

16:44.750 --> 16:46.000
Yes.

16:47.166 --> 16:50.167
Zombies are a primal fear,
you know.

16:50.167 --> 16:52.000
They're programmed to destroy.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.834
You can't reason with 'em,
you can't trick 'em.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.959
All you can do
is shoot 'em in the head

16:56.959 --> 16:59.209
and keep deleting 'em
one at a time.

16:59.209 --> 17:00.417
Like spam.

17:02.583 --> 17:06.541
Guys, we live in a world
that is impossibly complex.

17:06.541 --> 17:09.208
I mean, there's no way in heck
you can see the big picture.

17:09.208 --> 17:12.416
So all we can do is react
to what's right in front of us.

17:12.416 --> 17:15.416
'Now, a war against zombies
isn't winnable'

17:15.416 --> 17:17.250
but it is manageable.

17:18.834 --> 17:22.708
And isn't that just like
life in modern America?

17:22.708 --> 17:25.791
So...they're actual zombies?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.792
I really can't wait
to work with you guys.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.417
Especially you, um, I'm gonna go

17:30.417 --> 17:33.042
finish editing
my credit sequence.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.041
[bell dings]

17:41.417 --> 17:43.875
This won top film last year?

17:44.875 --> 17:47.166
[opera music]

17:51.083 --> 17:53.042
[humming]

17:56.917 --> 17:58.250
[imitates gun firing]

18:01.167 --> 18:02.750
[music continues]

18:02.750 --> 18:04.083
[sighs]

18:07.458 --> 18:08.458
What?

18:10.417 --> 18:11.708
[laughs]

18:11.708 --> 18:15.083
I  don't get this!

18:15.083 --> 18:17.084
[sobbing]

18:21.208 --> 18:22.542
[music stops]

18:24.375 --> 18:26.291
[intense music]

18:27.583 --> 18:30.000
- Boo!
- Ooh.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.041
Are you finished yet?

18:31.041 --> 18:34.166
Can I get a private screening?

18:34.166 --> 18:35.667
How about we grab some lunch?

18:35.667 --> 18:37.041
I am starving.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.000
Lunch? It's still morning.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.917
Oh, yeah, so it is,
sorry, I've, uh..

18:42.917 --> 18:45.000
'...been up all night editing.'

18:45.000 --> 18:47.250
Um, what do you say we rustle

18:47.250 --> 18:49.166
ourselves up
some coffee instead?

18:49.166 --> 18:51.375
Are you trying to avoid
showing me your movie?

18:54.167 --> 18:57.083
I'm not going to show it
to you, Savannah.

18:57.083 --> 19:00.083
I'm not going to show it
to anybody...actually.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.125
What are you talking about?

19:02.125 --> 19:04.959
I've decided
not to submit my film.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up.

19:07.792 --> 19:09.208
What happened?

19:09.208 --> 19:11.083
You were so confident
on set the other day.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.542
Nothing happened. It just..

19:13.542 --> 19:14.917
I met the other applicants

19:14.917 --> 19:18.125
and...I watched
the artsy-fartsy films

19:18.125 --> 19:20.708
of the students
that got in last year and..

19:20.708 --> 19:23.542
Look, if these film puritans
are never gonna get me

19:23.542 --> 19:26.209
then there's no way in hell
I'm going to give them

19:26.209 --> 19:28.333
the satisfaction of rejecting
my application.

19:32.209 --> 19:34.333
I get that you're scared, okay?

19:34.333 --> 19:36.333
But school gives
the opportunity to learn

19:36.333 --> 19:38.209
without the pressure
of the real world.

19:38.209 --> 19:40.667
Savannah, I'm not scared,
it's just, I've decided

19:40.667 --> 19:43.959
I can still make movies
without film school.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.209
I mean,
plenty of directors never

19:45.209 --> 19:47.542
even set foot in a classroom.

19:47.542 --> 19:49.959
- So that's that.
- That's that.

19:54.084 --> 19:55.750
You're making a huge mistake.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.750
I'm going to get some coffee.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.250
You sure you don't want to come?

20:00.250 --> 20:01.959
Okay.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.125
[sighs]

20:06.708 --> 20:09.625
[instrumental music]

20:30.500 --> 20:31.500
[beeping]

20:36.875 --> 20:38.083
[knock on door]

20:46.875 --> 20:48.875
Hey.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.417
Hey. Thanks for coming.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.417
What are you doing
hanging out at Wanda's?

20:55.417 --> 20:58.291
Uh, Wanda went to work,
so I thought

20:58.291 --> 21:00.333
I'd get a little
peace and quiet, hmph.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.291
Hmm.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.458
So, you finished your film?

21:06.458 --> 21:10.500
Oh, yeah.
It's finished. It's done.

21:13.041 --> 21:15.333
Congrats, Dan Patch.

21:17.167 --> 21:19.458
Well..

21:19.458 --> 21:21.708
[sighing]

21:23.500 --> 21:25.333
Mm, Marti?

21:26.917 --> 21:28.917
It's okay. I'm okay.

21:28.917 --> 21:30.542
Alright.

21:30.542 --> 21:31.708
Out with it.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.209
[sighs]

21:33.542 --> 21:34.917
Mmm.

21:34.917 --> 21:36.792
[chuckles]
Um.

21:38.125 --> 21:40.375
I warn you, it's, it's heavy.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.750
Who do you think
you're talking to, huh?

21:42.750 --> 21:44.750
Look at that.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.834
Come on.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.708
Over the years..

21:51.708 --> 21:53.166
...when Wanda wouldn't
really talk about Rex

21:53.166 --> 21:55.542
I...I came up with
all these ideas

21:55.542 --> 21:57.959
about who I thought
he might be, you know?

21:57.959 --> 21:59.750
Oh, yeah. What was it?

21:59.750 --> 22:02.750
One day he was a rock star
and...the next

22:02.750 --> 22:05.583
the coolest high school
music teacher ever.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.834
Yeah.

22:07.834 --> 22:11.542
But no matter what I imagined
he did for a living

22:11.542 --> 22:14.166
I'd...think most

22:14.166 --> 22:17.166
of the simple moments.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.000
Mm-hmm.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.792
Like riding in a car with him.

22:21.792 --> 22:23.000
Or going to a concert.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.458
[chuckles]

22:25.458 --> 22:28.209
We could talk.
We understood each other.

22:29.458 --> 22:32.583
My dad thought
the world of me.

22:34.209 --> 22:37.084
Why wouldn't he?

22:37.084 --> 22:39.250
'You know, if he were alive..'

22:39.250 --> 22:41.959
...I bet you
he'd tell you exactly that.

22:41.959 --> 22:43.167
[chuckles]

22:43.167 --> 22:45.166
Yeah.

22:45.166 --> 22:49.041
See, Rex didn't die
when my mom said he did.

22:49.041 --> 22:50.667
What?

22:52.125 --> 22:53.667
Nope.

22:53.667 --> 22:55.583
He just never came around
because he cared more

22:55.583 --> 22:58.208
about getting high
than he did about me.

22:58.208 --> 23:01.041
Wait, what are you,
what are you talking about?

23:01.041 --> 23:03.208
Wanda finally leveled with me.

23:04.500 --> 23:08.000
Rex wasn't just rough
around the edges.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.041
He was a serious addict.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.500
Wanda left him..

23:18.250 --> 23:20.291
...to protect us.

23:20.291 --> 23:22.959
To-to protect me.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.834
Told you it's heavy.

23:27.834 --> 23:29.458
[sighing]

23:29.458 --> 23:30.667
Whoa.

23:31.625 --> 23:33.875
Man, I am really sorry, M.

23:35.625 --> 23:39.458
I guess, a-at least
now you know the truth.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.125
And the truth doesn't change

23:41.125 --> 23:43.333
a single thing
about who you are.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.041
Yeah, but when I thought
he was dead, there was nothing

23:45.041 --> 23:47.959
I could do to change things.

23:49.750 --> 23:52.500
But knowing the truth..

23:57.125 --> 23:59.209
[sobbing]
...I keep thinking there's..

23:59.209 --> 24:01.500
Maybe there's
something wrong with me.

24:04.708 --> 24:07.084
You know what,
I wasn't enough to stay clean

24:07.084 --> 24:08.708
for or come back for?

24:10.041 --> 24:14.792
Hey, look, Rex's mistakes
are his mistakes, okay?

24:14.792 --> 24:15.667
[sobs]
Yeah.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.458
It's got nothing
to do with you.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.583
Yeah, but that's the problem.

24:21.917 --> 24:23.708
'What is?'

24:29.125 --> 24:30.834
[crying]
He was my dad, I..

24:38.167 --> 24:40.542
I wish it was about me.

24:41.917 --> 24:43.708
[sighing]

24:45.750 --> 24:48.208
I-I wish I was enough for him.

24:52.834 --> 24:54.125
'Hey.'

24:54.125 --> 24:56.333
[sobbing]

24:58.083 --> 24:59.166
[door opens]

24:59.166 --> 25:01.542
Hey, I got your text.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.084
What's up?

25:03.084 --> 25:05.750
Oh, hey, can you, can you..

25:14.166 --> 25:18.166
Is there any way you can get
that cheating story killed?

25:18.166 --> 25:20.250
How'd you even know about that?

25:20.250 --> 25:21.583
Well, Betsy told me.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.000
Now, look, if that thing goes

25:23.000 --> 25:25.458
she plans to hand over
the names of every athlete

25:25.458 --> 25:27.209
that's ever gotten
a paper from her.

25:27.209 --> 25:30.375
Oh, boo-hoo.

25:30.375 --> 25:32.417
This is the first thing
I've been excited about pursuing

25:32.417 --> 25:34.834
since I got to Lancer.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.042
'This could turn into
a career down the line.'

25:37.042 --> 25:39.500
I'm sorry,
but I am not giving it up.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.875
And not for a bunch
of lousy cheats.

25:42.875 --> 25:47.000
Uh, and since when
are you and Betsy friends?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.667
[scoffs]

25:50.000 --> 25:51.166
We're not.

25:51.166 --> 25:52.917
I'm..

25:56.917 --> 25:58.417
I'm a client.

25:59.667 --> 26:00.625
What?

26:00.625 --> 26:04.417
I got a paper from her,
freshman year.

26:05.834 --> 26:09.834
I don't believe it.
You have an insane GPA.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.291
Why would you
even need to cheat?

26:11.291 --> 26:13.417
It's complicated, okay?

26:14.041 --> 26:15.458
Now, can you do it?

26:15.458 --> 26:18.084
Can you...kill the story?

26:18.084 --> 26:21.208
I can't believe
you're making this my problem.

26:21.208 --> 26:24.167
Look, I know, okay? I'm sorry.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.291
Please.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.042
You know what, I'm sorry.

26:34.042 --> 26:37.667
You should have thought
of the consequences beforehand.

26:40.250 --> 26:44.667
I told Betsy talking to you
would be a waste of time. Psst.

26:51.917 --> 26:53.375
[sighing]

26:55.708 --> 26:57.083
Ahem.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.667
[cellphone ringing]

27:01.250 --> 27:03.125
Alice, hey.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.542
Kelsey, hi.

27:04.542 --> 27:07.917
So, my ex-boyfriend
is a bit of a jackass

27:07.917 --> 27:10.708
and he got himself mixed up
in the whole cheating thing.

27:10.708 --> 27:14.084
So, can we just kill the story?

27:14.084 --> 27:15.125
Excuse me?

27:15.125 --> 27:16.542
Make it go away?

27:16.542 --> 27:18.583
[laughing]

27:18.583 --> 27:22.333
'Oh, Alice, you are awesome.'

27:22.333 --> 27:24.000
Right.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.333
[chuckling]
Just kidding.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.333
Thanks anyway.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.042
Ugh!

27:32.917 --> 27:34.375
[knock on door]

27:35.166 --> 27:36.625
(Wanda)
'Marti?'

27:38.333 --> 27:40.167
Marti.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.834
[sighing]

27:47.834 --> 27:51.041
- Uh.
- Mom, what's this?

27:51.041 --> 27:53.625
This was your father's guitar.

27:53.625 --> 27:56.375
If he knew how much
you loved to play

27:56.375 --> 28:00.042
I know he would have
wanted you to have it.

28:00.042 --> 28:02.333
[sighs]

28:02.333 --> 28:04.084
You kept it all these years.

28:04.084 --> 28:06.667
I had it tucked away
in the garage.

28:08.125 --> 28:11.166
You know, there's some things
you, uh, just can't let go of

28:11.166 --> 28:14.417
when it comes
to the people you've loved.

28:14.417 --> 28:17.583
With your father,
it was his music.

28:17.583 --> 28:19.000
[chuckles]

28:28.083 --> 28:32.208
- 'Another song.'
- Oh, that's not just any song.

28:32.208 --> 28:36.875
I have had that put away
in a very special place.

28:38.042 --> 28:41.041
Rex wrote that the day
you were born.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.917
'I've never seen him so happy.'

28:45.042 --> 28:48.417
He thought
the world of you, Marti.

28:50.417 --> 28:51.625
[whispers]
He did?

28:53.917 --> 28:56.041
You'll see when you play it.

28:56.041 --> 28:57.667
'Yeah.'

29:02.834 --> 29:05.041
Mom, he might still be alive.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.084
At the very least..

29:10.417 --> 29:14.083
...he's alive...
through his music.

29:16.125 --> 29:19.084
He loved you
in the ways he could.

29:20.041 --> 29:21.125
[sighs]

29:23.250 --> 29:26.458
[instrumental music]

29:30.167 --> 29:32.125
Hmm. Thank you.

29:41.167 --> 29:42.291
Hey, sexy.

29:42.291 --> 29:44.125
You're coming with me.

29:44.125 --> 29:47.250
- Where we going?
- Movie date. Come on.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.000
(Savannah)
'Come on.'

29:52.917 --> 29:56.041
This is seriously out of bounds.
You had no right to do this.

29:56.041 --> 29:58.125
Okay, well, when a flyer
gets mental, you sometimes

29:58.125 --> 30:00.500
have to give them a little push
to get them out of the nest.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.750
I'm not a flyer,
nor am I a baby bird.

30:03.750 --> 30:06.959
I've spent my whole life
being judged, okay?

30:06.959 --> 30:09.208
I'm...I'm too religious.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.542
I'm not religious enough.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.417
My skirt's too short,
I'm a prude.

30:12.417 --> 30:14.625
I'm a clueless cheerleader.

30:14.625 --> 30:16.333
If I change the way I live
to avoid people's

30:16.333 --> 30:18.750
dumb opinions..

30:18.750 --> 30:20.959
...I'd be seriously missing out.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.167
Yeah.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.417
You have to do
what makes you happy.

30:32.417 --> 30:34.166
[crowd cheering]

30:35.792 --> 30:39.583
That's for your movie.
They're screening it right now.

30:39.583 --> 30:40.875
- It is?
- Yes.

30:40.875 --> 30:42.792
Please come watch with me,
come on!

30:42.792 --> 30:44.458
It sounds like laughter.

30:44.458 --> 30:46.375

Don't look so scared, everyone!

31:42.084 --> 31:43.667
We're not going down
without a fight!

31:43.667 --> 31:45.333
But how?
How are we gonna fight back?

31:45.333 --> 31:50.125
- We're completely defenseless!
- That's not entirely true.

31:55.625 --> 31:58.458

36:23.959 --> 36:25.667
...would you please tell us

36:25.667 --> 36:27.250
how this vision of yours

36:27.250 --> 36:30.166
contributes to film
as an art form?

36:33.042 --> 36:36.042
Oh. Um..

36:38.583 --> 36:40.625
Mr. Patch?

36:42.333 --> 36:44.875
You didn't make your film
for anyone but you.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.084
Defend it.

36:48.291 --> 36:49.500
Okay.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.084
Well, uh..

36:56.000 --> 36:58.625
I guess it's pretty simple.

36:59.834 --> 37:02.084
I love old horror movies.

37:02.084 --> 37:05.417
I look at filmmakers
like...Val Lewton'

37:05.417 --> 37:08.000
John Carpenter, George Romero.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
I mean, these guys were artists.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.625
You know,
"Night of the Living Dead"

37:12.625 --> 37:15.042
has been preserved
in the National Film Registry

37:15.042 --> 37:18.834
for being culturally
and aesthetically significant.

37:18.834 --> 37:20.708
'I mean, all the great
classic horror films'

37:20.708 --> 37:22.875
'from directors like these,
and I'm not talking'

37:22.875 --> 37:27.667
about the, the torture porn
that's so popular today.

37:27.667 --> 37:30.000
You know, these films..

37:30.000 --> 37:32.667
...they commented
on real issues.

37:32.667 --> 37:36.000
Uh, "Dawn of the Dead" was
a satire of consumer culture.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
The Original "Hills Have Eyes"

37:38.000 --> 37:40.750
was a critique
of the Vietnam War.

37:40.750 --> 37:43.708
'Films like these
can entertain people'

37:43.708 --> 37:47.041

something important.

37:49.084 --> 37:52.458
That...to me..

37:52.458 --> 37:54.667
...is art.

37:54.667 --> 37:57.083
I guess
to answer your question..

37:57.083 --> 38:01.084
...my film's about
overcoming fear.

38:01.084 --> 38:02.083
Something I learned a lot about

38:02.083 --> 38:04.250
