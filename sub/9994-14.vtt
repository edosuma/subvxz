04:33.400 --> 04:36.099
Yeah, I-I'd rather not talk
about how I know

04:36.100 --> 04:40.700
that a plane is going to crash
ten days before it happens.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.199
I'm sorry,
I don't have a location.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.300
I just know that they're
headed towards Las Vegas.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.399
I was just hoping that
we could do something,

04:47.400 --> 04:49.700
reach out to the people who
are going to be on this plane,

04:49.700 --> 04:51.400
stop them
from taking this trip.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.100
The man flying the plane
is named Ken.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.900
I'm sorry, that's
all I have: Ken.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.500
He's middle-aged.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.599
Uh, he's a white man,
he's medium build.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.799
Oh, and there's
a passenger.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.200
Uh, a woman: Amy.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.199
She's younger.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.000
Mid-30s, I'm guessing.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.099
Well, I did call the FAA.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.700
They suggested I call you.

05:16.700 --> 05:20.200
Yes, I realize what the Department
of Homeland Security does.

05:21.300 --> 05:21.600
(mouthing)

05:23.300 --> 05:25.399
Yes, I'm an American citizen.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.500
Hang up.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.399
Yes, that's my phone number.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.900
Hang up.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.300
Yes, that's my address.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.700
Allison, put down the phone.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.200
Hey, I'm not going to tell you
if that's my Social or not.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.600
Department of
Homeland Security?Are you insane?

05:38.600 --> 05:39.900
What would you have me do?

05:39.900 --> 05:42.500
Your boss is going to be here
to pick you up in 20 minutes.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.300
I got up half an hour early
to get the girls to school.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.499
How about you take a break
from getting us put on

05:47.500 --> 05:50.300
the national watch
list and get washed and dressed?

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
ALLISON:
 <i>And then you get</i> to the part of the
conversation where they go,

05:53.500 --> 05:55.200
"And how do you know this?"

05:55.200 --> 05:58.400
And they either say it like they're talking
to Chicken Little or...

05:59.400 --> 06:01.300
(groaning):
Osama bin Allison.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.000
(chuckles)

06:02.900 --> 06:04.000
The 28th?

06:04.700 --> 06:07.300
Heading towards
Las Vegas? Okay.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.700
What do you mean, "Okay"?

06:09.900 --> 06:12.299
Well, I was thinking you could
sit with a sketch artist,

06:12.300 --> 06:14.600
develop a likeness of the
people you saw in the plane.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.700
We could distribute the
sketches around the country--

06:16.700 --> 06:19.200
regional airports, aircraft
maintenance facilities--

06:19.200 --> 06:22.400
say they were "people of
interest" in an investigation.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.999
There's no guarantee anyone
will actually recognize them,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.100
but at least
it's something.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.000
Thank you.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.300
(sighing):
I.D.'s out.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.800
Prison gate's up ahead.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.699
ALLISON:
 <i>So what is it we're doing here?</i>

06:32.700 --> 06:34.300
I thought you'd
never ask.

06:34.900 --> 06:38.900
Supposedly, your friend Sonny
Troyer wants to confess to yet another murder.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.299
Sonny Troy is
not my friend.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.900
I've never even
met the man.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.099
Nonetheless, you and I
know it was the information

06:44.100 --> 06:46.700
you gave us that led to
his capture and conviction.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.399
It just seemed prudent
to have you here.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.200
Is there a problem?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.199
I guess not.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.300
You know, I was only able
to tell you what I did

06:54.400 --> 06:55.400
because, for some reason,

06:55.400 --> 06:59.400
Mr. Troyer and I began having the same dreams--

06:59.700 --> 07:01.100
dreams about women--

07:01.100 --> 07:04.100
alone, isolated,
in some kind of trouble.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.600
Women he would then attack
and kill.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.199
He threatened me,
he threatened my family.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
It wasn't pleasant.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.400
It's not something
that I'm anxious to repeat.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.400
Allison, the man is
serving three life terms.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.399
There's no reason to believe
he can do you any harm

07:16.400 --> 07:19.199
from behind bars, but
if you're uncomfortable,

07:19.200 --> 07:20.900
I can certainly
handle this myself.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.200
(lock buzzes)

07:29.000 --> 07:29.900
Sonny Troyer.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.600
Mr. Troyer, perhaps you
remember me from your trial.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.100
I'm Manuel Devalos,
the city District Attorney.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.200
You asked for
this meeting.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.200
(inhales)

07:48.200 --> 07:49.100
(laughs quietly)

07:49.600 --> 07:51.200
Sorry, forgive me.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.700
"To sleep,
perchance to dream."

07:53.700 --> 07:55.600
I wouldn't want
to miss anything.

07:55.700 --> 07:59.000
I'm sure you've
had plenty of time to dream in the past
nine months or so.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.300
Suspect you'll
have plenty of time in the months and
years to come.

08:02.700 --> 08:03.600
(laughing):
I hope so.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.300
I'm sorry;
I didn't catch your name.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.500
Allison.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.600
Sorry?

08:09.900 --> 08:12.000
(exhales)

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Allison.
Would that be Dubois?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.300
We finally meet.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.899
And how are <i>your</i> dreams,
Allison Dubois?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.600
That's none of
your business.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.400
I'm sorry you feel that way.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.600
I don't get too many visitors,

08:27.600 --> 08:30.100
much less ones with whom
I have so much in common.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.000
Does he know
our little secret?

08:36.500 --> 08:37.700
I still see them--

08:38.299 --> 08:41.500
all those helpless women,
in over their heads,

08:41.700 --> 08:45.500
hoping someone will find them
and rescue them.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.500
That musbe very...
frustrating for you.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.800
I can dream.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.200
(clears throat)

08:53.200 --> 08:55.300
Will your attorney be joining us?

08:55.500 --> 08:57.800
??

08:57.800 --> 09:00.299
After I was given my third
consecutive life sentence,

09:00.300 --> 09:01.900
it all seemed
rather pointless.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.100
Then let's get
on with it.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.399
You have something
to confess and we don't have
a lot of time.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.199
You sound nervous,
Mr. District Attorney.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.800
I can hear it
in your voice.

09:09.900 --> 09:12.199
Born in Arizona,
but when you're anxious,

09:12.200 --> 09:14.500
a little bit of your parents'
native Jalisco kicks in.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.799
Hard consonants, switching
your "I"s and "E"s.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.400
I remember noticing that
during your cross-examination.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.700
You're wasting my time.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.400
Debra Waldman.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.200
Ah...

09:31.300 --> 09:32.800
You remember Debra Waldman.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.400
Been missing... ah...
three years now, right?

09:37.900 --> 09:42.500
Spent her last night on Earth at a border bar a lot
of Mesa Uni students visit for the cheap booze.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.100
She was pretty drunk
when her friends ditched her.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.000
By the time she
wandered into the desert

09:48.100 --> 09:50.699
lost and confused,
filled with fear,

09:50.700 --> 09:52.700
I was already having
dreams about her.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.000
When she passed out,

09:55.400 --> 09:58.100
I was already two-thirds
of the way there.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.400
Okay.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.900
Where's her body?

10:02.700 --> 10:04.600
Raised in Oklahoma?

10:05.100 --> 10:07.700
I've never heard
your voice in person before,

10:07.700 --> 10:10.600
but there it is,diphthongization
of short vowels and all.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.300
Mr. Troyer...

10:13.800 --> 10:16.800
The state of Texas has filed
papers for my extradition.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.999
Seems they found the remains
of a young woman

10:19.000 --> 10:20.599
in a grain silo
outside Aberdeen.

10:20.600 --> 10:24.600
Something about my DNA
being present in several of the pockets
between her teeth and gums.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.699
Those forensic scientists,

10:27.700 --> 10:29.599
those Crime Scene Investigators,

10:29.600 --> 10:31.600
they all have
such lurid imaginations.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.300
??

10:33.300 --> 10:33.400
(slams chains on table)

10:33.700 --> 10:36.399
Nonetheless,
the state of Texas seems

10:36.400 --> 10:39.600
to actually enjoy executing
fellows like me.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I would prefer to stay here,
in comfortable Arizona,

10:44.100 --> 10:47.200
serve my three life sentences,
and dream.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.700
If you file papers
to block their extradition,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.499
I will provide you
with precise directions

10:56.500 --> 10:59.600
to the location of
Ms. Waldman's remains.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.600
It was nice to finally
make your acquaintance.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.400
Deputy Mayor Lynn
DiNovi, please.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.400
Saure, I'll hold.

11:16.700 --> 11:17.799
Something
bothering you?

11:17.800 --> 11:18.700
It's weird.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.500
When Sonny Troyer was active,
when he was killing,

11:21.900 --> 11:24.000
I dreamt the same
dreams he had.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.599
I never dreamt
of Debbie Waldman.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.599
Of course, that was before
I worked in your office,

11:27.600 --> 11:30.000
before I took
everything that I felt,everything I dreamt
so seriously.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.200
Are you suggesting
he's lying?

11:32.300 --> 11:33.299
To be honest with you,

11:33.300 --> 11:35.899
the bell that's going off
loudest in my head

11:35.900 --> 11:37.799
has to do with the plane crash
ten days from...

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
Lynn. Manuel.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.500
Hold onto your hat.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.199
Sonny Troyer, the serial killer,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.599
just confessed to
the killing of Debra Waldman,

11:45.600 --> 11:48.000
the co-ed who's been
missing since 2004.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.799
No, he won't tell us
where the body is

11:50.800 --> 11:53.399
until we get Texas to waive his
extradition on another matter,

11:53.400 --> 11:54.700
which is why I'm calling.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.200
I need you to tell the mayor
to call the governor.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.500
I need the governor
to get on the phone??

12:07.900 --> 12:09.000
(chuckles):
Hey.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.400
If it isn't our favorite
candidate for city council.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.000
To what do I
owe this honor?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.100
It's done.

12:15.100 --> 12:15.899
Excuse me?

12:15.900 --> 12:18.700
Late last night, the
Governor called the Mayor.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.700
Texas is gonna waive their
rights to Sonny Troyer,

12:21.700 --> 12:22.800
at least for
the moment.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.499
At least long enough
for you to see

12:24.500 --> 12:26.200
if there really is a body
where he says there is.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.700
So let me ask you...
Whew!

12:33.700 --> 12:36.500
how sure are you that what this guy's
telling you is the truth?

12:36.600 --> 12:38.200
Are you pretty confident
about this body?

12:38.200 --> 12:39.499
What's he gain
by lying?

12:39.500 --> 12:41.800
If he tells us where to go
and there's no body there,

12:41.800 --> 12:43.400
he's still in prison for
the rest of his life,

12:43.400 --> 12:45.500
and Texas is still free
to take him and fry him.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.100
The mayor might want to leak
something to the press

12:49.700 --> 12:53.100
about an ongoing investigation
into the disappearance of a young college co-ed,

12:53.300 --> 12:55.300
an investigation
spearheaded by His Honor.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.300
You. Me.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.499
Well, that wouldn't
be a bad thing

12:59.500 --> 13:03.200
for someone running for,
say, city council, would it?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.800
Not a bad thing for
a district attorney either.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.000
(knocking on door)

13:09.000 --> 13:09.900
DEVALOS:
 <i>Yeah?</i>

13:11.300 --> 13:11.899
Hey.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.000
I got a fistful of messages
here from you.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.500
Are you stalking me?
I've been trying
to get in to see you all day.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.700
It's the 27th.
Okay.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.799
Tomorrow's the day that small
plane is supposed to go down.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.399
I was wondering if you got
any calls from anyone,

13:22.400 --> 13:24.500
off our sketches--
any persons of interest.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.400
Not a one.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.200
Well, maybe that's good news.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.400
Maybe it's gonna happen
on the 28th of another month.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.900
Maybe we can still stop it.

13:34.700 --> 13:35.900
Maybe.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.000
I, uh...

13:42.100 --> 13:43.000
Sorry.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.100
JOE:
 <i>It's been over a week, Allison.</i>

13:48.100 --> 13:49.499
You done
everything you can.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.399
Well, that's the thing.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.500
I really haven't been
able to do anything, really.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.500
Well, maybe you're
not supposed to.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.200
What is that
supposed to mean?

14:00.200 --> 14:00.900
Well, I don't know.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.500
I don't subscribe to the
Psychic Friends Network.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.399
But if the modus operandi
you have to buy into

14:06.400 --> 14:08.800
is that there's actually
a plan for all this,

14:09.500 --> 14:12.100
then perhaps this once
you're not part of it.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.499
Perhaps this
particular message,

14:15.500 --> 14:19.500
this particular dream, ended
up in your inbox by mistake.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.600
What are you saying, these
people are supposed to die?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.100
Maybe that's the
plan for them.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.300
Maybe they're
horrible people.

14:29.200 --> 14:29.899
No.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.500
I don't believe that.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.300
(siren blaring)

14:45.900 --> 14:48.000
(fire roaring)

14:48.100 --> 14:50.700
MAN (over P.A.):
All prisoners, step away from the plane!

14:53.700 --> 14:56.700
All prisoners,
step away from the plane!

15:02.400 --> 15:04.000
All prisoners in the yard

15:04.300 --> 15:06.700
will immediately
return to the block.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.800
All prisoners in the yard
will immediately...

15:10.200 --> 15:12.300
Oh, my God.He knows about the plane.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.099
(chuckles):
Hey, early bird.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.299
It's not even 7:00.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.300
Don't you carry
your cell phone?
It's in my office.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.399
I called your house.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.899
Yeah, I've been here
since quarter to 6:00

15:24.900 --> 15:27.699
working in the law library,
putting together the thing for the judge tomorrow.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.700
I know why
Sonny Troyer confessed to killing
Debbie Waldman.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.099
He dreamt about the
same plane crash I did.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.100
Not this again, Allison.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.799
I've already done everything
I possibly can.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.000
It is going to happen.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.100
That plane is gonna crash
into the Arizona State Prison.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.100
This morning, today, 8:19.

15:43.100 --> 15:46.800
Sonny Troyer is gonna
make it his business to be out on the prison
yard when it does.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.899
Think about it:
He dreamt the dream,

15:48.900 --> 15:50.899
he recognized
the location,

15:50.900 --> 15:52.900
he realized that if
he was sent to Texas,

15:52.900 --> 15:54.499
he would miss his
chance at escape,

15:54.500 --> 15:56.599
so he came up with the
whole confession thing.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.900
Has he told you the
location of the body yet?

15:59.100 --> 16:01.499
Today. I'm scheduled to go out
to the prison this afternoon.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.500
He's not even gonna be
there this afternoon.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.400
Please.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.899
We have to call
the prison.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.400
We have to find
the warden.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.099
What do I tell him?

16:08.100 --> 16:12.100
Anything. Anything
that'll keep Sonny Troyer off of that
prison yard till after 8:19.

16:12.500 --> 16:16.500
(line ringing over speakerphone)

16:17.100 --> 16:17.999
ECKLER:
This is Warden Eckler.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.999
Warden Eckler-- I'm
sorry to disturb you at such an early
hour, sir.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.499
This is District Attorney
Manuel Devalos over in Phoenix.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.800
I have you on speakerphone.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.199
Morning, Mr. District Attorney.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.299
Just getting into my office.
How can I...?

16:28.300 --> 16:31.800
Sir, some investigators working
under me have just come into

16:31.800 --> 16:34.100
some highly credible information
about a possible

16:34.100 --> 16:36.799
large-scale escape attempt
at your prison.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.799
Are you serious?

16:37.800 --> 16:38.899
I most certainly am.

16:38.900 --> 16:42.900
To the best of our knowledge,
the plan is set to happen just after
8:00 this morning.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.700
I'm not at liberty to
discuss the particulars,

16:45.700 --> 16:48.999
but it is crucial that you clear
the prison yard immediately

16:49.000 --> 16:51.300
and initiate
an immediate lockdown.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.299
And specifically,
most specifically,

16:53.300 --> 16:56.499
that you isolate
prisoner number 16309,

16:56.500 --> 16:58.000
Sonny Troyer.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.900
A pretty tall order, counselor.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.500
It's already quarter past 7:00
on my watch.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.300
But I think we can
make this happen.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.398
(laughs)

17:06.400 --> 17:07.700
Much appreciated, sir.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.099
Yeah, well, you owe me
a steak dinner next time I'm over your way.

17:11.099 --> 17:13.999
(jet engines roaring)

17:14.000 --> 17:15.800
What the hell?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.400
Hang on a second.

17:18.700 --> 17:22.200
(engines roaring louder)

17:22.200 --> 17:25.000
(explosion,
then alarm sounding)

17:25.000 --> 17:26.400
(dial tone)

17:26.400 --> 17:27.599
Come on...

17:27.700 --> 17:28.900
(speed dialing beeps)

17:28.900 --> 17:32.100
(musical tone)

17:32.100 --> 17:35.100
FEMALE VOICE:
You have reached a number that has been disconnected...
No, wait-- it's only 7:20.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.999
Please check the number
and try your call again.

17:38.000 --> 17:38.800
(musical tone)

17:42.100 --> 17:44.300
TV ANCHORMAN:
And the hunt continues tonight for Sonny Troyer,

17:44.300 --> 17:48.199
the notorious serial killer who escaped from
Arizona State Prison today

17:48.200 --> 17:52.200
after a freakish
private jet crash that killed two.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.200
A statewide manhunt
is currently underway,

17:54.300 --> 17:57.200
with federal marshals
coordinating their efforts

17:57.200 --> 17:59.600
with local authorities,
setting up roadblocks

17:59.700 --> 18:01.199
and monitoring
all airports and...

18:01.200 --> 18:02.200
(TV turns off)

18:02.300 --> 18:05.000
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.299
That was the FAA.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.199
The pilot was
a Ken Androsky,

18:10.200 --> 18:12.899
and his passenger was
his girlfriend Amy Chandler.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.199
They took off from
a private airstrip
in El Paso;

18:15.200 --> 18:16.600
they didn't file a flight plan.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.500
El Paso, Texas--an hour ahead of us.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.900
There's no way
you could have known.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.599
He knew.
Sonny Troyer knew.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.999
He heard it in their accents.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.500
(knocking)

18:25.700 --> 18:28.300
Hey, I just went through Sonny
Troyer's cell with the dogs.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.300
No luck at all.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.700
Apparently, he doused everything
with rubbing alcohol--

18:31.800 --> 18:33.700
his clothes, the linens,
even his mattress.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.899
Even switched clothes with
one of the other inmates

18:35.900 --> 18:37.500
before he went out to
the yard this morning.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.300
This isn't what you'd
call a spontaneous trip.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.600
You want to see
something else?

18:43.900 --> 18:46.300
DEVALOS:
 <i>Scientific Foundations</i>
 <i>of ESP,</i>

18:46.300 --> 18:48.500
 <i>Psychic Phenomena</i>
 <i>in the Real World,</i>

18:48.800 --> 18:52.100
 <i>The Uses and Control</i>
 <i>of Paranormal Activity.</i>

18:52.300 --> 18:54.600
Looks like he's getting ready
for a test of some kind.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.200
Getting ready
for something.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.299
Why couldn't he just hang out

18:57.300 --> 18:59.300
in the weight room
with all the other lifers?

19:01.300 --> 19:01.800
ALLISON:
 <i>You know what?</i>

19:01.900 --> 19:05.500
This marshal on TV, he was
talking about prison breaks

19:05.500 --> 19:09.000
and how they
usually have everyone rounded up
in six hours.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.000
Now where is he hiding?

19:10.100 --> 19:12.900
He's one man, on foot,
wearing an orange jumpsuit.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.300
How hard can that be to find?

19:14.900 --> 19:15.400
(yawns):
I don't know.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.000
But if he
caught a break,

19:17.100 --> 19:19.399
he could be halfway
to Mexico by now.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.399
No.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.200
He's somewhere asleep.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.600
Excuse me?

19:25.500 --> 19:26.300
Think about it.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.100
He's just spent
nine frustrating months

19:29.100 --> 19:32.400
waiting for an opportunity
to do what he does best:

19:32.600 --> 19:34.500
to prey on women in peril.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.900
And to what do we
owe this optimism?

19:38.600 --> 19:42.600
??that they pulled
out of his cell.

19:42.900 --> 19:45.100
This is not a man
waiting to retire.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.600
So they close
off the border,

19:48.900 --> 19:51.200
make it impossible
for him to leave.

19:51.500 --> 19:55.300
No-- he's gonna do
what he's built to do,and he's gonna do it
right here in Phoenix...

19:56.200 --> 19:57.899
soon as he can
get some sleep;

19:57.900 --> 19:59.900
soon as he can
close his eyes.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.700
Closing eyes.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.900
Getting rest.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.600
Oh, my goodness.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.900
I think this fellow
may be onto something.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.300
(sighs)

20:11.600 --> 20:12.700
Hey...

20:13.700 --> 20:15.300
That's not funny.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.500
I'm still talking.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.100
(groans)

20:19.400 --> 20:20.400
Hey.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.999
Fine, play dead.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.800
You won't be
playing for long.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.400
(sighs)

20:28.400 --> 20:29.300
(bell dings)

20:47.800 --> 20:49.600
(elevator clanks)

20:51.800 --> 20:53.600
Oh, geez.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.500
Lord...

21:02.100 --> 21:03.300
Please.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.100
Hello...?!

21:19.300 --> 21:21.400
Hello!

21:23.100 --> 21:25.500
Can anyone hear me?!

21:27.200 --> 21:28.900
Help!

21:29.900 --> 21:30.999
Help...!

21:31.000 --> 21:31.800
(gasps)

21:36.500 --> 21:38.000
(groaning):
Allison.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.599
There's a woman--
she's trapped in an elevator,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.300
She's calling for help.
What?

21:44.300 --> 21:45.299
(sighs)
It's those dreams.

21:45.300 --> 21:48.999
The same one that Sonny Troyer's
having, I'm having them again.I have to call Scanlon.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.100
No. Honey...

21:50.400 --> 21:52.900
Even if he's having the same
dreams, which you don't know,

21:53.100 --> 21:54.800
he's a wanted man.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.200
His face is on
every newscast;

21:57.300 --> 21:58.900
every cop in town
is looking for him.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.400
I mean, do you really
think that he's gonna

22:01.400 --> 22:05.200
stick his neck out to kill
this woman in an elevator?

22:05.200 --> 22:06.700
Do you want to take
that chance?

22:06.700 --> 22:09.000
I have to get her out
of there.
But out of where?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.700
Do you know, do you know
where the elevator is 

22:11.700 --> 22:13.900
or the building's
address?

22:20.400 --> 22:21.299
(cat meowing)

22:21.300 --> 22:24.600
WOMAN:
Quincy. Quincy.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.900
Get down here, Quincy.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.500
Quincy!

22:52.800 --> 22:54.400
(grunting)

22:54.400 --> 22:56.500
(screaming)

23:06.900 --> 23:08.700
Hello!

23:11.300 --> 23:13.800
Is anyone there?!

23:16.500 --> 23:18.500
Hello!

23:21.000 --> 23:22.299
Is anyone there?!

23:22.300 --> 23:24.100
(gasping)

23:26.800 --> 23:29.000
There's a girl somewhere.

23:29.700 --> 23:33.600
Her-- she was trying
to get her cat out of the tree.
She just fell.

23:34.900 --> 23:36.100
Okay.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.400
All right. Were there...

23:38.900 --> 23:40.500
Were there any, uh,

23:40.500 --> 23:42.600
like, landmarks
or buildings?

23:42.900 --> 23:44.200
It was the woods.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.400
It was dark.
There were trees.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.599
So it's like a state
park or something?

23:48.600 --> 23:52.500
I don't know.
I just know her damn cat's name is Quincy.
That's all I know.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.900
Hmm. Okay.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.400
Well, wait-- now,
that's good, right?

23:56.500 --> 23:59.900
Because that means that
that's all that he
knows, too, right?

24:03.100 --> 24:04.200
(moans)

24:08.900 --> 24:10.700
(ring tone playing)

24:15.500 --> 24:16.300
Hello?

24:16.600 --> 24:19.899
TROYER:
God... I'm guessing you having as much trouble
sleeping as I am.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.700
One dream after the other.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.200
I guess when it rains
it pours, huh?

24:24.900 --> 24:26.200
How did you get this number?

24:26.500 --> 24:30.000
First that poor woman
in the elevator. Then that girl
with the kitty cat.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.600
Did you find her
as attractive as I did?

24:32.700 --> 24:35.100
She was kind of fetching,
wasn't she?

24:35.100 --> 24:37.200
Now there's a word you don't
hear too much anymore--
It's him.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.199
"Fetching."
Call Scanlon.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.500
Anyway, none of that is why I really called.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.500
I really called to talk
about our situation.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.300
What are you talking about?

24:47.600 --> 24:48.799
"Our situation"?

24:48.800 --> 24:51.700
Well, I mean... we're kind of at a standoff here,
don't you think?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.200
I have a dream.
You have a dream.

24:53.200 --> 24:57.200
It's gonna make it
really hard for me to do the things that I have to do.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.999
Not to mention cops everywhere,
my mug shot on the TV.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I had to pay a homeless guy $25 bucks to buy me
this cell phone.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.400
I just don't think
we can go on this way.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.599
Hey, did you have the dream
about that blonde mom

25:09.600 --> 25:10.900
boo-hooing to her husband

25:11.000 --> 25:13.200
because she just couldn't
figure out her dreams?

25:13.200 --> 25:16.300
Did you have that one, too,
or was that just me?

25:16.800 --> 25:20.700
I don't know where
the elevator lady is...or the cat girl.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.500
But that blonde mom?

25:22.600 --> 25:24.300
I've been to her house.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.900
I don't know what else
to suggest.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.800
He does know where you live.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.799
I mean, uh...
I could move you and your family
to a hotel, but...

25:38.800 --> 25:41.000
that presents all sorts
of other problems.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.500
I really do think
the best solution is just to hunker down
right here.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.000
We'll keep a be a visible police
presence outside your home.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.199
Wait a second.
I got work.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.900
The girls have school.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Work? How're you
gonna go to work?

25:52.200 --> 25:53.900
I can barely keep
my eyes open.

25:54.900 --> 25:57.400
It's 5:40 in the morning,
we've been up since 2:00.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.699
How are you going
to go to work?

25:58.700 --> 26:00.499
I don't really have
a choice, Allison.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.999
I don't think work is a problem.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.800
With all due respect,
you're not really our killer's type.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.600
But the girls,

26:07.100 --> 26:09.600
Allison--
I would just feel better

26:09.600 --> 26:11.100
if they were all in one place.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.600
(elevator bell dings)

26:23.100 --> 26:24.100
Good morning.

26:25.700 --> 26:26.900
I beg to differ.

26:28.300 --> 26:29.999
I got a call at
4:00 this morning

26:30.000 --> 26:31.900
from a reporter on
the <i>Arizona Observer.</i>

26:32.300 --> 26:34.399
This reporter claims you
actually phoned officials

26:34.400 --> 26:38.400
at Arizona State Prison to warn
them about that jet crash 90 seconds <i>before</i> it happened.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Before the plane crashed?

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
That, uh... doesn't
make any sense.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.600
I don't know-- a plane
falls from the sky,

26:48.900 --> 26:51.100
I'm sure there's an enormous
amount of panic, confusion...

26:51.200 --> 26:54.099
Why was your office circulating sketches
of "persons of interest"

26:54.100 --> 26:57.600
to airports and aircraft
maintenance facilities a week
before the crash--

26:57.600 --> 26:59.600
sketches that look
exactly like the victims?

27:00.900 --> 27:01.599
I'm sorry.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.299
I can't help but think
that someone is confusing

27:04.300 --> 27:07.000
two separate investigations.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.299
If we coincidentally
sent out sketches

27:09.300 --> 27:11.699
that happened to look like
the two victims of the crash...

27:11.700 --> 27:14.500
Manuel... based on
our conversation,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.800
my boss, your boss,
the mayor...

27:18.100 --> 27:19.400
called our governor.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.299
Our governor called Texas.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.400
Now reporters are calling me.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.400
I <i>will</i> need answers.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.600
Do you have any idea
the blame storm that's
going to rain down on all of us 

27:29.600 --> 27:32.399
if
there's reason to believe we knew, but
didn't do everything we could

27:32.400 --> 27:34.100
to prevent the escape
of a serial killer?

27:34.100 --> 27:38.100
Once we've captured
Mr. Troyer, and we will,once he's brought to justice,

27:38.500 --> 27:42.400
I'm sure all these questions will be answered
to everyone's satisfaction.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.600
I hope you're right.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.900
(phone ringing)

27:54.200 --> 27:57.900
Oh... Ariel?Honey, can you,
uh, get the phone and mute the TV?

28:01.800 --> 28:03.700
(TV mutes)

28:03.700 --> 28:06.300
Thanks. Hello?

28:06.500 --> 28:07.700
SCANLON:
Get any sleep yet?

28:08.200 --> 28:09.500
You're joking, right?

28:09.800 --> 28:13.000
Do you think any of the cops outside would like
to do a little babysitting?

28:13.100 --> 28:16.100
Yeah, I don't think
our boy Troyer got all that much rest either.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.599
I'm here waiting
for the coroner to come help clean up the mess
he made last night.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.400
What?!

28:22.700 --> 28:24.900
Was it a nurse in an elevator?

28:24.900 --> 28:26.600
Or was it a girl in the woods?

28:27.300 --> 28:29.000
A woman in a Dumpster.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.799
Seems like she got in a fight
with her boyfriend

28:30.800 --> 28:32.600
while they were driving
to Flagstaff.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.199
He left her to calm down
at a rest stop here on the Intestate.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.100
He says that was around
4:00 in the morning.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.599
Ring a bell?
No, how could it?

28:39.600 --> 28:41.200
I've been awake
since Troyer called.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.800
And he knew I would be.

28:43.800 --> 28:44.900
Excuse me?

28:45.300 --> 28:47.000
Damn, he's smart.

28:47.300 --> 28:49.100
He wasn't really threatening me.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.600
He was frightening me.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.900
He wanted to be sure
that I would stay awake,

28:53.900 --> 28:56.300
to be sure that I couldn't
dream his dreams.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.800
WOMAN:
 <i>Hey roomie, it's me.</i>

28:59.300 --> 29:01.600
Waiting for some stuff
to print out. What are you doing?

29:02.700 --> 29:04.499
I know. It's all over the news.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.100
I wish they'd just catch
the son of a bitch already.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.000
You're damn right, it's scary.

29:10.300 --> 29:14.300
Look, just pour yourself one of your Bloody Marys
and get to bed.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.600
You'll forget
he's even out there.

29:17.900 --> 29:19.100
No vodka?!

29:20.200 --> 29:22.399
Tell you what:
I'll call the liquor store

29:22.400 --> 29:25.000
and have them deliver,
but by the time I get home,

29:25.300 --> 29:27.600
you better have one
mixed for me, too.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.300
(laughing)

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Night.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.199
(auto-dial beeping)

29:36.200 --> 29:37.800
Hello, Christopher's Liquors?

29:38.100 --> 29:39.700
Yeah, order for delivery.

29:40.100 --> 29:43.300
Claire Williams,
1701 Pike's Way.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.600
(door closing)

30:20.100 --> 30:21.900
(clattering in distance)

30:37.400 --> 30:39.100
Detective Lee Scanlon please.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.100
There's Sleeping Beauty.
Hey, Mom,

30:44.100 --> 30:45.799
I ordered pizza.
What time is it?

30:45.800 --> 30:48.799
Um, it's a little after 7:00.
Have you looked out the window?

30:48.800 --> 30:50.399
There's, like, a brigade
of cops out there.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.399
Our neighbor's yelling
at them 'cause there's
nowhere to park.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.300
Wait... Lee?

30:54.500 --> 30:57.000
Hey, I had another dream.
There's a woman.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.600
Her name is Claire Williams.

30:58.700 --> 31:02.000
She's stuck on the roof of the Phoenix East
buding downtown.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.900
She locked herself out
and she feels trapped and vulnerable.

31:04.900 --> 31:06.300
Phoenix East. Got it.

31:14.700 --> 31:16.100
(helicopter whirring)

31:17.500 --> 31:19.900
OFFICER (P.A.):
Claire Williams!
Claire Williams!

31:19.900 --> 31:22.100
This is the Phoenix
Metro Police.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.799
Move away from the dr.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.700
Move away from the door.
(crashing)

31:25.700 --> 31:27.900
(screams)

31:32.700 --> 31:35.399
Okay, look-- I know we're not
supposed to smoke on the roof.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.500
I know we're not supposed
to smoke on the roof.

31:37.900 --> 31:38.900
Don't shoot me.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.400
Don't shoot me

31:41.900 --> 31:42.899
SCANLON:
 <i>Her name's Claire Williams.</i>

31:42.900 --> 31:45.599
She's a statistical
analyst in data

31:45.600 --> 31:47.600
reconfiguration--
whatever the hell that is.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.700
CLAIRE:
Detective Scanlon?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.600
Yes, Ms. Williams?
Hi.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.300
I just wanted
to thank you.

31:52.700 --> 31:56.500
And... well, would
it be possible for me to get a ride home?

31:56.800 --> 31:58.900
My roommate's not
answering the phone.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.599
I can't figure it.
I know she's home.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.600
I just talked to
her an hour ago.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.000
Yeah, I'll have
an officer run you home.
What's your address?

32:06.100 --> 32:11.000
1701 Pike's Way.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.500
How did you know that?
Your roommate...

32:13.600 --> 32:15.900
She was alone and she was
afraid, wasn't she?

32:25.000 --> 32:25.800
OFFICER:
Clear!

32:27.100 --> 32:28.100
OFFICER 2:
Detective!

32:43.900 --> 32:45.100
We're bored.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.200
Yeah.
We want to go out.

32:47.200 --> 32:51.200
Yeah.
We're sick of being stuck
in the house.
Yeah.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.500
ALLISON:
 <i>e, we have a problem.</i>

32:53.600 --> 32:55.500
I'm looking at
a potential mutiny here.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.800
It's Saturday and the girls
are going stir-crazy.

32:57.800 --> 33:01.100
Joe wants to take them up to his sister in Flagstaff
for the weekend.

33:01.100 --> 33:02.300
I think it's a good idea.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.300
Flagstaff, huh?

33:04.500 --> 33:06.000
I'll stay here
on Dream Patrol.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.499
The house is surrounded
by police;

33:07.500 --> 33:09.200
I feel completely safe.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.500
The girls are just
at the end of their rope.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.600
Okay. I'll have one of my guys
follow them up there.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.500
I'll give the Flagstaff PD
a shout,make sure
they're on alert as well.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.600
I'll call you like a
hured, 150 times a day.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.300
You call me
as much as you like.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.000
Okay.

33:26.700 --> 33:27.500
You got it?

33:28.200 --> 33:29.599
(dog barking in distance)

33:29.600 --> 33:31.300
Bridge, honey?

33:31.600 --> 33:33.600
Daddy wants to go!

33:33.600 --> 33:35.700
BRIDGETTE:
I'm looking
for something!

33:36.000 --> 33:38.300
She's looking for her
baseball bat and batting helmet

33:38.400 --> 33:40.399
in case she has to beat up
the serial killer guy.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.200
Honey, you don't
need that!

33:42.400 --> 33:43.700
BRIDGETTE:
Yes, I do!

33:44.100 --> 33:46.100
Hurry up and
catch this guy, Mom,

33:46.100 --> 33:47.900
so we can
come back home.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.300
I'll try.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.100
(smooching)

33:54.300 --> 33:55.800
Bridgette!

34:00.700 --> 34:03.700
(indistinct police radio
communication in distance)

34:25.199 --> 34:27.100
(yawning)

34:27.199 --> 34:29.199
TV REPORTER:
...hospital for
sick children.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.800
Tracy Hooper was given
the liver

34:30.800 --> 34:32.300
of a nine-year-old
accident victim,

34:32.300 --> 34:34.000
in a four-hour operation.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.699
Hooper is in critical
but stable condition,

34:36.800 --> 34:38.500
normal after
such an operation.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.100
Her condition will be
monitored for 72 hours

34:41.100 --> 34:43.300
to see if there's any sign
of organ rejection.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.699
Shoot me and
I'll never forgive you.

34:45.699 --> 34:49.400
(sighs)

34:49.400 --> 34:50.500
Are you crazy?

34:51.900 --> 34:53.500
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

34:53.900 --> 34:54.998
How did you get
in here?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.100
You left me a key.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.499
 Remember?
The night you broke it off?

34:58.500 --> 35:01.800
Left me sitting in
that restaurant...
I don't want to talk about this.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.199
Not tonight. Not now.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.899
I said things,
you said things, but this is not the time.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.700
There's a maniac out there,
killing women,

35:07.800 --> 35:08.999
making an ass out of me.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.300
You wanna spend the night,
that's fine.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.000
But I have no interest
in talking.

35:12.600 --> 35:13.999
Put your ego back in your pants.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.700
I have no interest in staying.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.999
I'm here to get some
questions answered.
I just said...

35:18.000 --> 35:20.899
Not about us, about why a woman
who works part-time

35:20.900 --> 35:24.400
for the District Attorney's
Office is being given 24-hour police protection.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.100
I'm talking about
Allison Dubois.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.100
Okay.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.200
That's your answer?

35:34.400 --> 35:35.400
"Okay?"

35:37.300 --> 35:38.899
Are you aware of that the
message Sonny Troyer wrote

35:38.900 --> 35:41.399
in blood last night:
"Wrong Roommate Allison"?

35:41.400 --> 35:42.300
Yeah.

35:42.900 --> 35:43.700
I was there.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.100
What's the connection between
this woman and Sonny Troyer?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.200
I am not at liberty
to discuss this with you.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.700
Let me paint a
picture for you.

35:50.700 --> 35:53.100
There's a journalist that
calls me four times a day.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.000
She thinks the District
Attorney's Office

35:55.100 --> 35:58.500
somew knew that Sonny
Troyer was going to escape from that penitentiary
ahead of time.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.699
I'm starting to
believe her.

35:59.700 --> 36:00.699
And you can bet

36:00.700 --> 36:02.300
I'm not the only
one she's calling.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.600
This thing is getting ready to
blow up in everybody's face.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.500
The DA, me, you.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.300
Lynn, listen to me.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.500
Leave... this... be.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.400
We're going
to catch this guy.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.900
It'll make all
the questions go away.It always does.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.800
No. Lee...

36:17.700 --> 36:19.100
Tell me what's going on.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.800
Let me help you.

36:22.700 --> 36:23.900
I would tell you...

36:25.400 --> 36:27.200
...but the truth is
you'd never believe it.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.700
Hell, there are days
I don't even believe it.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.200
(engine revving)

36:32.300 --> 36:34.100
(tires squealing)

36:39.000 --> 36:41.200
(tires squealing)

36:55.200 --> 36:57.000
(sighs)

37:02.400 --> 37:03.700
(keypad beeping)

37:06.300 --> 37:08.000
Joe, it's me.

37:08.000 --> 37:08.800
Hi.

37:08.800 --> 37:09.800
Is something wrong?

37:10.000 --> 37:10.799
It's the middle of the night.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.999
I'm watching out the window;

37:12.000 --> 37:13.900
it looks like all the
police cars are leaving.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.300
There's only one left...

37:15.900 --> 37:17.000
and now he's gone.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.399
Hang up. Call Scanlon.Maybe it's good news.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.600
Maybe they caught the guy.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.200
(line ringing)

37:28.500 --> 37:29.000
(gasping):
Lee.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.200
Yeah. Who am I talking to?

37:30.200 --> 37:32.000
Lee! It's me. It's Allison.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.399
They took all the police away.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.500
What is going on?
I'm here all by myself.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.399
Damn it--
she promised me she wouldn't do anything until the morning.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.200
What are you talking about?

37:40.400 --> 37:41.299
That Deputy Mayor.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.599
She was asking a lot
of questions.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.000
I wouldn't tell her
what she wanted to know.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.599
She was threatening
to pull the plug on everything

37:45.600 --> 37:47.900
but I thought for sure she was
gonna give me till the morning.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.400
I'll be right there.I'm coming right over.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.500
yeah Hey.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.300
There's, uh, been a mix up.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.700
They took the police cars away,

37:59.700 --> 38:01.699
but it's okay 'cause
Scanlon's coming over.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.200
He's going to be here
in 20 minutes.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.500
All right, I'm waking the kids,
we're coming home.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.499
No, don't do that.

38:06.500 --> 38:09.500
Honestly. You're hours away.He'll be here in a few minutes.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.700
I don't care.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.100
No, please don't.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.599
Please, I don't...I'm upset and frightened enough.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.200
That'll just make me feel worse.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.100
Joe? Joe?

38:33.100 --> 38:33.899
Lee!

38:33.900 --> 38:36.100
My power went down.
My phones are out.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.200
Damn it.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.400
Allison, calm down.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.500
Calm down.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.399
There's a pretty strong wind
off the desert.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.900
It may have just...
I'm scared.

38:46.200 --> 38:46.999
I know.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.799
I'm still maybe ten,
12 minutes away.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.000
Just hang tight.

38:50.200 --> 38:53.300
Double-check your windows
and doors and by the time you're done,
I'll be there.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.000
I had a dream.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.099
(screams)

38:58.100 --> 38:59.300
And you were in it.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.800
(pounding on door)
Electric company!Heard you might be
having a problem!

39:09.800 --> 39:11.299
Allison, be a dear
and open the door.

39:11.300 --> 39:12.800
We don't want to
disturb the neighbors.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.200
Lee! He's here!

39:18.400 --> 39:20.400
Allison, I'm still
ten minutes away.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.600
Ten minutes!

39:21.600 --> 39:23.900
You were ten minutes away
ten minutes ago!

39:24.100 --> 39:25.400
I'm doing 90.

39:26.900 --> 39:27.700
(screams)

39:30.200 --> 39:32.100
He's trying to smash his way in!

39:33.000 --> 39:33.799
Lee?

39:33.800 --> 39:35.100
Are you there?

39:35.900 --> 39:37.800
(pounding on glass)

39:39.300 --> 39:40.300
Lee?

39:49.200 --> 39:52.100
(gunfire)

39:53.900 --> 39:54.600
(sighs)
You okay?

39:54.900 --> 39:56.400
Oh...

39:59.400 --> 40:00.700
(distant siren wailing)

40:00.700 --> 40:01.600
SCANLON:
I'm sorry.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.200
We're sorry.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.800
That whole thing hinged
on you not knowing.

40:07.800 --> 40:11.000
You had to be alone; feel
vulnerable, terrified.

40:13.800 --> 40:14.700
I get it.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.099
DINOVI:
The police never
really left.

40:17.100 --> 40:19.000
You were really never
in any danger.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.600
So, I bet you're full
of questions.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.800
Nothing that can't wait.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.099
I'm going to go home.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.500
Let you two talk.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.200
Go ahead,
go say good-bye to her.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.100
Hey...

40:47.900 --> 40:48.600
Thank you.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.400
I don't think I would have
gotten to this on my own.

40:53.500 --> 40:54.400
You're welcome.

40:58.600 --> 40:59.700
So how about my key?

41:01.600 --> 41:02.800
You want it back?

41:03.100 --> 41:04.200
Nah. It's okay.

41:04.900 --> 41:05.900
I'll change the lock.

41:06.800 --> 41:07.800
No, you won't.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.200
If you ever pull anything
like that again...

41:22.500 --> 41:23.499
Are you kidding?

41:23.500 --> 41:25.800
This is my new technique
for solving murder sprees.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.699
Scare the wits out
of Allison Dubois

41:27.700 --> 41:29.600
and then, uh, bring
in the firing squad.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.099
Can't argue
with success.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.600
How dead is he?

41:34.100 --> 41:35.300
Real dead.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.200
Very dead.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.600
You should sleep
just fine.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.400
Just because he's dead?

41:41.100 --> 41:44.600
No, it doesn't work
that way.
