00:32.902 --> 00:35.426
Hey! Hey, Rob.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.775
Rob McCann?

00:36.819 --> 00:38.516
Yes?

00:50.789 --> 00:52.095
Victim's Robert McCann.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.967
He took one
to the heart at 1034.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.249
Pretty specific time of death.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.883
Yeah.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.842
Two citizens heard shots fired
and called 911.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.602
We don't usually get called
to the party for a shooting.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.541
This isn't just a shooting.

01:03.585 --> 01:06.501
It's way bigger than that.

01:06.544 --> 01:10.809
Black victim and...

01:10.853 --> 01:12.115
"vermin."

01:14.248 --> 01:17.468
Written in the guy's blood.

01:17.512 --> 01:20.036
We're thinking maybe
we have a hate crime here.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.840
Yeah, you were right to call
and loop us in.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.170
Any witnesses?

01:23.213 --> 01:25.563
We're canvassing,
but none so far.

01:25.607 --> 01:27.522
What about physical evidence?

01:27.565 --> 01:29.915
It's early days, but we found
a dark blue fiber

01:29.959 --> 01:32.179
transferred
from the killer's shirt.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.972
That pin.

01:43.015 --> 01:46.193
Units gave these to
embedded journalists in Iraq.

01:46.236 --> 01:49.152
He was a reporter.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.203
That could explain "vermin."

01:56.246 --> 01:58.814
Puts a new spin on this,
doesn't it?

01:58.857 --> 02:03.775
Yeah, it does.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.477
Maggie?

02:09.520 --> 02:12.828
- Hey, Paul.
- It's been a while.

02:12.871 --> 02:17.267
- Since Jason's...
- Yeah.

02:18.312 --> 02:21.663
My husband used to write
freelance pieces for Paul.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.404
Special Agent Zidan.

02:23.447 --> 02:27.321
So Rob McCann.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.975
We're all in a state of shock.
It's such a terrible tragedy.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.629
How well did you know him?

02:31.673 --> 02:34.066
Well, I worked with Rob
every day for seven years.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.001
I watched him grow
into one of our star reporters.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.722
You know if he had any enemies?

02:37.766 --> 02:39.550
Well, that's an understatement.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.553
He wrote exposés for us.
Mostly about public corruption.

02:42.597 --> 02:46.253
He upset a great many people.
Powerful people.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.255
- What about threats?
- We all get 'em.

02:48.298 --> 02:49.647
It's part of the job these days.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.562
You know, angry calls.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.086
Reader comments, but some
of Rob's were truly vile.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.567
Any of them more
than just words?

02:56.611 --> 02:59.091
As a matter of fact, yes.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.181
Two days ago, a man tried
to force his way in here,

03:01.224 --> 03:04.009
demanding to talk to Rob.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.404
Rob McCann. Shot dead.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.754
Possibly because
he was a journalist.

03:09.798 --> 03:12.322
These are troubled times
for the Fourth Estate, folks.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.237
Exhibit A.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.892
This guy who crashed "Ledger"
offices to confront McCann.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.763
He bolted before security
could grab him,

03:18.807 --> 03:22.202
but he is described as tall.
40, salt-and-pepper beard.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.247
See if McCann's coworkers
know who he is,

03:24.291 --> 03:26.356
and have your team start
looking into McCann's articles.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.208
Who'd he call out?
Whose toes did he step on?

03:28.251 --> 03:31.254
I want names, people.
JT, where are we on the wife?

03:31.298 --> 03:34.083
Linda McCannshe was at
a medical conference in L.A.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.519
Flight lands at JFK
in two hours.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.086
- Jubal?
- Yeah?

03:37.129 --> 03:38.542
I was checking posts
on the "Ledger" website.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.394
I think I found something.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.936
- Besides vitriol?
- I don't know what's wrong

03:41.960 --> 03:45.660
with these people...
especially this guy.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.662
Crusader86 here.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.838
He posted 30 comments
on Rob McCann's articles

03:49.881 --> 03:51.318
in the last two months,

03:51.361 --> 03:54.146
and here is what
he posted yesterday.

03:54.190 --> 03:57.280
"McCann is vermin,
and he deserves to die."

03:57.324 --> 03:58.997
He used that same word
in two other posts.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.588
Can you get me his name?

04:00.631 --> 04:02.720
I'm assuming
it's not crusader86.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.418
It looks like the account
is tied

04:04.461 --> 04:07.551
to an email registered
to an Edgar Santos.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.249
Edgar Santos.

04:09.292 --> 04:12.513
That sounds familiar,
becausewhere is it? Yes.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.863
Santos was a building inspector
who took bribes to look

04:14.906 --> 04:16.733
the other way
on code violations.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.259
Two months ago
McCann wrote that story.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.436
Now Santos is facing
major prison time.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.742
He certainly
matches the description

04:24.786 --> 04:26.831
Tall, 40, salt-and-pepper beard.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.311
How about that?

04:32.620 --> 04:35.753
Hi, I'm here with FBI
Special Agent Maggie Bell.

04:35.797 --> 04:38.408
She's radiant with lustrous hair

04:38.452 --> 04:42.760
and brown eyes that gleam
with sensual promise.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.632
She's clad in a low-cut blouse
which,

04:44.675 --> 04:46.155
in this reporter's view,

04:46.198 --> 04:47.809
is not quite low cut enough.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.339
Boy. Hot and cut.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.428
- What are you watching?
- Nothing.

04:59.647 --> 05:02.519
- Let's go.
- What? We have a lead?

05:02.563 --> 05:04.826
Better yet. We have a suspect.

05:08.220 --> 05:12.050
Edgar Santos? We need to talk.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.705
- What about?
- We want to talk to you about

05:14.749 --> 05:16.577
where you were last night.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.057
Hey, hey, I didn't give you
permission to do...

05:19.101 --> 05:21.799
I don't need your permission.
Check this out.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.954
The address for
the New York "Ledger"

05:26.978 --> 05:28.240
and Rob McCann's apartment.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.938
And he got a ticket,

05:29.981 --> 05:31.916
at 1000 last night,
two blocks from Central Park.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.334
You know what? I'm not going
anywhere with you people.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.771
It's voluntary questioning,
and I can say no.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.468
Not anymore.
You're under arrest.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.390
That look familiar?

05:47.434 --> 05:49.827
Some comments I posted. So what?

05:49.871 --> 05:53.178
- Calling Rob McCann vermin.
- Hey. Freedom of speech.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.528
Not when you threaten his life.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.356
What about my life?

05:56.399 --> 05:58.662
Look what he did to me
with that article of his.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.795
I lost my job, my wife,

06:00.838 --> 06:03.493
my reputation, my freedom.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.061
I lost everything,
because of him.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.584
Yeah.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.325
Did he make you
take those bribes too?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.371
It's not like
I was the only one.

06:11.414 --> 06:14.417
Right. This is all his fault

06:14.461 --> 06:17.420
which is why you drove down
to the New York Ledger.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.335
Give him a piece
of your mind, right?

06:19.379 --> 06:22.338
But when that didn't work,

06:22.382 --> 06:23.948
you took it to the next level.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.733
Not sure what you mean.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.562
Rob McCann was
murdered last night.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.088
He's dead?

06:33.131 --> 06:34.481
You have his home address.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.396
You were stalking him.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.851
- No. I mean I wouldn't say...
- And then you caught up

06:37.875 --> 06:39.157
with him in the park,
and you shot him.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.618
What? No. No, it wasn't me.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.577
I swear to you
I did not kill him.

06:43.620 --> 06:46.014
He was a great reporter.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.146
Happily married.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.670
He had his whole life
ahead of him,

06:49.713 --> 06:53.587
and then just like that...

06:53.630 --> 06:56.677
snatched away.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.983
What has she told you
about Jason?

07:00.681 --> 07:03.161
That he was a reporter
who died in a car crash.

07:03.205 --> 07:06.338
That's why this case strikes
such a chord in her.

07:06.382 --> 07:09.429
Why she identifies so strongly
with the victim.

07:09.472 --> 07:12.344
It won't affect her
objectivity as an investigator.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.757
Well, I trust you'll keep me
in the loop,

07:13.781 --> 07:16.566
if you see that changing.

07:21.658 --> 07:25.227
This puts you in the area
when Rob McCann died,

07:25.270 --> 07:26.750
so explain that.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.491
Okay.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.494
I saw McCann catch a cab,
and I followed him,

07:31.538 --> 07:33.540
but I ran a red light
trying to keep up.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.759
That's how I got the ticket.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.631
After that, I drove around
looking for him.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.565
I was about to give up when
I saw him walk into the park.

07:39.589 --> 07:40.958
And you walked
in right after him.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.331
No.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.028
I drove around
to Central Park West

07:44.072 --> 07:46.074
and waited for him
to come out the other side.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.772
I just wanted to talk to him,
all right?

07:48.816 --> 07:50.731
- But he never showed.
- Okay.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.273
Then give me a witness
that saw you sitting

07:52.297 --> 07:53.864
in your car,
in Central Park West.

07:53.908 --> 07:57.520
I can't. There was no witness.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.740
First degree murder.
Lying in wait.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.220
Do you have any idea
what's about to happen to you?

08:02.264 --> 08:03.483
Wait. Wait.

08:03.526 --> 08:06.355
- There was somebody.
- Who?

08:06.398 --> 08:09.532
A jogger.
He came out of the park,

08:09.576 --> 08:12.448
off the path
that I figured McCann was on.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.060
- When was that?
- A little after 1030 maybe.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.473
- What did he look like?
- Like a jogger.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.673
I don't know.
He was wearing a hoodie.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.327
What color?

08:22.371 --> 08:24.416
Dark blue.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.638
There's your jogger.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.466
No CCTV footage,
but I did manage

08:30.510 --> 08:32.337
to find a restaurant
with security cameras

08:32.381 --> 08:34.905
pointed towards the right
stretch of Central Park West.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.429
The blue fiber came back
as a cotton-poly blend

08:37.472 --> 08:40.389
which is consistent with
the sweatshirt he's wearing,

08:40.432 --> 08:44.087
and there's Santos,
from 1025 to 1042.

08:44.131 --> 08:45.960
He never left his car.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.396
Which alibis him out.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.137
I'm starting to wonder.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.400
I mean you would expect
a murder like this

08:51.443 --> 08:53.228
to be more rage-filled.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.510
You know, with signs
of a beating

08:54.534 --> 08:56.318
or gunshot wounds to the face.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.885
We have none of that.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.756
Maybe the killer
saw Santos' post

08:59.800 --> 09:02.367
and left that message
to throw us off?

09:02.411 --> 09:03.934
I was thinking the same thing.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.893
In fact, aspects of this
remind me of a case

09:05.936 --> 09:07.547
I was consulting on last year.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.287
What case?

09:09.331 --> 09:11.855
The death of a Michigan state
senator, in Lansing.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.857
I read that.
A mugging gone wrong?

09:13.901 --> 09:15.816
Well, those were
the official findings,

09:15.859 --> 09:18.470
but this guy had
some really shady dealings,

09:18.514 --> 09:21.952
and I always thought that
the murder was more planned.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.800
Do you think we're dealing
with the same killer?

09:23.824 --> 09:25.390
I don't know,
but the senator died

09:25.434 --> 09:27.218
from a single shot to the heart,

09:27.262 --> 09:30.308
and a jogger was caught
on video fleeing the scene.

09:30.352 --> 09:33.007
Here's the jogger
from the Michigan case.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.968
I mean it could be the same guy.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.753
Yeah, but he's wearing
a hoodie too.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.363
You can't tell.

09:41.406 --> 09:45.280
Unless we compare the gaits.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.543
We have a software that can
analyze

09:47.587 --> 09:49.545
the biomechanics
of how he moves.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.026
Your gait can be as unique
as your fingerprint.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.955
91% match.

10:07.998 --> 10:10.697
The Michigan jogger and
the Central Park West jogger...

10:10.740 --> 10:12.524
They're the same person.

10:12.568 --> 10:16.093
Looks to me like Rob McCann's
murder was a professional hit.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.583
People, please turn your hymnals

10:27.627 --> 10:29.890
to section 1958
of the federal code

10:29.933 --> 10:32.457
with the snappy title
"Murder for Hire."

10:32.501 --> 10:34.285
We now believe McCann's killer
is a pro

10:34.329 --> 10:37.332
who also took out a state
senator in Lansing last year.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.769
Quantico's video analysis
indicates that the suspect

10:39.813 --> 10:42.337
"is a white male,
30 to 40's, 6" tall.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.991
Let's call Lansing area hotels.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.490
Get the names of the guests
that checked out

10:45.514 --> 10:47.168
right after
the senator's murder.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.865
Our guy may be on that list.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.651
I was doing my residency
at St. Luke's

10:51.694 --> 10:55.785
when Rob was embedded
with the Marines in Fallujah.

10:55.829 --> 10:59.354
That's when I was terrified
I'd lose him.

10:59.397 --> 11:03.532
Not now. Not here.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.316
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.407
We're very sorry for your loss.

11:11.758 --> 11:17.894
So someone hired this man to...

11:17.938 --> 11:19.548
Why? Over something Rob wrote?

11:19.591 --> 11:21.115
We're not sure yet.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.832
Did he have any issues
with drugs? Gambling?

11:22.856 --> 11:24.422
No. Nothing like that.

11:24.466 --> 11:27.948
Has he been worried lately
or concerned?

11:27.991 --> 11:30.298
If anything, he was excited

11:30.341 --> 11:32.169
about a new story
he was working on.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.736
What story?

11:33.780 --> 11:36.696
He wasn't ready to talk
about it yet.

11:36.739 --> 11:37.847
He said it was the sort of thing

11:37.871 --> 11:39.873
that could win a Pulitzer.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.876
Most reporters keep notebooks.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.268
Did your husband have one?

11:44.312 --> 11:46.923
- Yes.
- Is it here?

11:46.967 --> 11:49.883
- He carried it with him.
- It wasn't found on his body.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.536
Are you sure?

11:51.580 --> 11:53.713
Rob never went anywhere
without his notebook.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.327
That's significant, isn't it?

12:00.197 --> 12:01.982
It might be.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.134
Do you have any idea why he was
in the park last night?

12:04.158 --> 12:06.551
I don't know exactly.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.162
When we talked on the phone,
he did say

12:08.205 --> 12:10.381
he was planning
to meet with a source.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.514
A source on this news story?

12:12.557 --> 12:15.256
Yes, I think so.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.000
I talked to Rob's editor
and his colleagues.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.784
He didn't tell them
about the story either.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.806
Well, whatever it is,
I think it's the key to this.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.657
What does his browser
history show?

12:25.701 --> 12:28.008
Mostly stuff for articles
he had in the pipeline,

12:28.051 --> 12:31.141
except for some searches
on pediatric oncology.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.796
Does Rob have a kid
in his circle who has cancer?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.102
Not that we can find.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.930
Okay. What about this source?

12:36.973 --> 12:39.280
Any phone calls that point
to who that might be?

12:39.323 --> 12:41.369
Rob did get some calls
from a burner phone,

12:41.412 --> 12:43.260
but we're still trying to trace
who it belongs to.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.286
And Rob McCann's autopsy
report just dropped.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.810
Looks like he had
a 0.07 blood alcohol level.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.725
Okay, so he met
his source for drinks.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.422
That is my takeaway.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.598
Could you put any
of those drinks on a card?

12:53.642 --> 12:55.339
No. It looks like he paid cash.

12:55.383 --> 12:59.213
He withdrew $100 from an ATM
on 67th and Columbus.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.823
Can you shoot us over a list

13:00.867 --> 13:02.279
of all the bars
and restaurants in the area?

13:02.303 --> 13:03.826
Hold on. I might not need to.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.741
Checking past credit
card charges.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.614
I see two visits to a bar
a block away from that ATM.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.184
Yeah, I remember him.
He sat right over there.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.273
Ordered two glasses of pinot.

13:16.317 --> 13:20.364
Hey, my shift just ended.
Is this gonna take long?

13:20.408 --> 13:22.149
It will with that attitude.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.760
- Who was he with?
- He was alone.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.173
It seemed like he was waiting
for someone, but nobody showed,

13:27.197 --> 13:28.808
so he paid up and split.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.418
Anybody come in after he left?

13:30.461 --> 13:33.116
- Maybe looking for him?
- Nope.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.726
There was a guy.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.467
- What guy?
- He was at the bar.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.861
When pinot left,
he left right after him.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.907
Do you have security cameras?

13:40.950 --> 13:44.693
Just the one pointed
at the till to keep us honest.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.129
The guy at the bar.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.566
Have you seen him before?
Maybe a regular?

13:48.610 --> 13:50.699
Definitely not a regular.

13:50.742 --> 13:53.093
Why are you so sure?

13:53.136 --> 13:55.791
He tried to play a song
on the jukebox.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.924
The regulars know
it hasn't worked in months.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.928
The bad news is there's
no cameras outside the bar,

14:01.971 --> 14:03.906
so we couldn't get eyes
on whoever followed McCann,

14:03.930 --> 14:06.497
ERT lifted a primo print

14:06.541 --> 14:08.717
off the jukebox's coin
return button

14:08.760 --> 14:10.937
belonging to one
William Patterson.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.113
- Patterson has a record?
- No.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.550
His prints popped because
he signed up for global entry.

14:15.593 --> 14:18.118
- Could he be our jogger?
- Same age and height.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.076
On the other hand,
he's a math professor at NYU,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.122
so there's that.
He lives in Scarsdale.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.167
I just sent
his address and photo.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.908
Okay. Thanks.

14:25.952 --> 14:29.303
Not a lot of hit men out there
who are math professors.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.218
Which makes it
a pretty great cover.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.959
Isn't it more likely

14:33.002 --> 14:34.980
that Patterson was the source
that Rob was meeting?

14:35.004 --> 14:36.745
Then why didn't they
actually meet?

14:36.788 --> 14:38.965
Why didn't he show
his face at the bar?

14:39.008 --> 14:42.011
Why did he follow Rob out?

14:42.055 --> 14:45.754
So our killer, whoever it is,
just goes up to Rob,

14:45.797 --> 14:48.061
has no idea who he is,
and shoots him.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.193
Cold blood.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.692
Do you think he even thinks
about the pain

14:51.716 --> 14:53.544
he's left behind?

14:53.588 --> 14:58.071
All the dominoes that fall?
The wife he made a widow?

15:01.074 --> 15:05.426
A thing like that must be hard.

15:08.037 --> 15:11.562
It is.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.390
Really wish you could
have met Jason.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.783
Me too.

15:14.826 --> 15:18.613
You guys would have hit it off.

15:18.656 --> 15:21.442
I would say

15:21.485 --> 15:23.661
one of my favorite
things about Jason is that...

15:25.359 --> 15:28.101
In some small way, he believed

15:28.144 --> 15:30.407
that, being a reporter,

15:30.451 --> 15:33.410
he could change the world.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.499
I think he did.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.421
Jubal. What you got?

15:44.465 --> 15:46.380
Hey, there's a flag on the play.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.686
Forget Patterson's house.
We got a hit on his vehicle.

15:56.085 --> 16:00.785
Thirty yards,
east southeast there.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.222
Backed up.

16:02.265 --> 16:06.356
The turnoff says a mile
down the road.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.316
Are you okay?

16:09.359 --> 16:11.274
Fine.

16:11.318 --> 16:14.147
Back about another 60 paces.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.116
It's Patterson.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.516
Looks like Patterson
was going about 80

16:35.559 --> 16:38.693
when the driver's side front
tire blew, and he lost control.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.565
Which is in keeping with the
man's abysmal driving record.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.959
Five wrecks in two years.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.743
Doesn't exactly fit the profile

16:45.787 --> 16:47.397
for your methodical hit man.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.399
Well, that's because
he isn't one.

16:49.443 --> 16:52.402
Apparently, Patterson tore his
Achilles tendon six weeks ago.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.623
So he couldn't be our jogger.
What else do we know about him?

16:55.666 --> 16:56.861
Not enough. He's not married.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.321
No kids. No family we can find.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.410
But we do know he spoke
to Rob McCann.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.325
Those burner calls that Rob got?

17:02.369 --> 17:05.285
We traced 'em to a phone
Patterson purchased last week.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.461
Okay. Thanks.

17:07.503 --> 17:08.829
So Patterson is
definitely Rob's source,

17:08.853 --> 17:10.681
but what's the story?

17:10.724 --> 17:12.790
Something sensitive enough
that he bought a burner phone.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.512
He took some
major precautions here.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.252
That's why he tailed Rob
out of the bar,

17:17.297 --> 17:18.646
so they could talk in private.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.126
Yeah, he was afraid

17:20.169 --> 17:21.755
someone might find out
he met with a reporter.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.738
So now he's dead in a car crash?

17:23.781 --> 17:27.220
I know. The timing's weird.

17:27.262 --> 17:29.657
Agent Bell, Agent Zidan.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.876
It's part of
a radio-controlled receiver

17:31.920 --> 17:35.271
used to detonate a small IED
that blew the tire.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.534
This was no accident.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.496
I bet whoever killed Rob
also killed Patterson.

17:42.539 --> 17:45.020
The hit man had to be tailing
him to detonate the IED.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.935
Yeah.
Make sure the target was dead.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.633
Country road. No traffic.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.201
It's the perfect place
to pull this off.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.700
It could explain
why Patterson was speeding.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.465
The hit man was chasing him.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.033
Suspect might have touched
this vehicle.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.513
I want to get it
checked for prints.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.515
Driver's side door.
All around the body.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.559
- Got it.
- Wait.

18:02.603 --> 18:05.736
Where are the keys?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.956
There's no key in the ignition.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.436
Maybe the hit man took 'em.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.612
I bet he's headed
to Patterson's house.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.001
- Clear.
- Clear.

18:59.529 --> 19:02.053
Clearly our hit man
beat us here.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.055
First, he takes Rob's notebook.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.319
Then he tears this place apart.

19:06.362 --> 19:09.539
This guy's tying up loose ends.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.256
- But what's he looking for?
- I don't know,

19:11.280 --> 19:12.890
but whatever it is
might still be here.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.849
I'm gonna call T
and have him run a search.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.681
Hey, check this out.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.597
It's Patterson's ER paperwork
for when he tore his Achilles.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.468
- So?
- So we need to find people

19:25.512 --> 19:27.296
who knew him, right?

19:27.340 --> 19:29.646
Lists his emergency contact.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.997
Russell Donovan.

19:33.041 --> 19:36.044
I can't even begin
to process this.

19:36.087 --> 19:40.135
Mr. Donovan, what was your
relationship to Mr. Patterson?

19:41.092 --> 19:43.051
William and I met at Yale.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.749
He was my first love.

19:45.793 --> 19:48.970
It didn't last,
but we stayed close.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.233
I think I was one of
the few friends he had.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.975
When was the last time
you two spoke?

19:54.018 --> 19:56.020
Three or four days ago
it must have been.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.935
It was a strange call.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.764
- Strange how?
- He was being paranoid.

20:00.808 --> 20:04.290
Saying that he thought people
were following him.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.857
- What people?
- I don't know.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.120
He was eccentric.

20:09.164 --> 20:12.602
I thought he was just being
William, so I humored him.

20:12.646 --> 20:16.258
He was trying to tell me
something, and I didn't listen.

20:19.566 --> 20:22.482
What else was he involved in,
besides teaching math?

20:22.525 --> 20:24.701
Statistical analysis.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.573
William was sought after
for his ability

20:26.616 --> 20:30.403
to parse huge sets of data.
It was all a bit over my head.

20:30.446 --> 20:33.536
"Sought after"? By whom?

20:33.580 --> 20:37.323
I know that he was working on
at least one research project.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.368
Do you know
what the project was?

20:39.412 --> 20:44.025
No, he didn't tell me.
He was very tight-lipped.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.637
Okay.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.354
Thank you for your time.
You'll be hearing from us.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.380
That was the head
of NYU's math department.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.947
Patterson's project was funded

20:52.990 --> 20:55.036
by a grant
from the Defense Department.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.691
- Which project?
- It's classified.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.301
A hit man? Classified projects?

20:59.345 --> 21:01.434
What the hell is going on here?

21:01.477 --> 21:02.913
I don't know,
but we're gonna need

21:02.957 --> 21:04.326
a warrant
to check out that research.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.222
We just got a lead
on his murder.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.272
Hey, watch and learn, kids.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.709
This is yeoman's work
by young Kristen here.

21:15.752 --> 21:18.189
Or yeo-woman's.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.629
Drone? Car crash?

21:22.672 --> 21:25.066
The killer used a drone
to kill Patterson?

21:25.109 --> 21:26.739
Yes, but not in the way
that you're thinking.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.504
Remember that

21:28.548 --> 21:29.916
remote-controlled receiver
that blew the tire out?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.333
- Yeah.
- Our killer repurposed it

21:31.377 --> 21:34.118
from a Bluehawk 2 quad copter,

21:34.162 --> 21:36.164
so our techs traced
the serial number

21:36.207 --> 21:39.472
and tracked the purchase to him.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.127
He paid cash,
so no digital trail.

21:43.171 --> 21:45.913
Damn. Still can't see his face.

21:45.956 --> 21:48.307
'Cause he's staying
turned away from the camera.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.658
This guy's good.

21:51.701 --> 21:54.138
Wait, what's on his neck?
Is that a scar?

21:54.182 --> 21:55.488
AFIS logs scars and tattoos.

21:55.531 --> 21:56.924
Did you run it
through the system?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.404
Nice, but she found
a better way,

21:58.447 --> 22:00.231
by going back
to the senator's murder.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.103
These are all the people
who checked out of

22:02.146 --> 22:05.019
Lansing hotels the day
after the senator's death.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.717
I filtered through
for white males 30 to 40,

22:07.761 --> 22:09.676
6" tall, staying alone,

22:09.719 --> 22:11.547
which narrowed it
down to 200 people,

22:12.418 --> 22:14.855
but only one of them booked
a ticket to New York

22:14.898 --> 22:16.509
in the past week.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.293
Frank Cutler.

22:21.601 --> 22:24.081
That's him.
Same scar on the neck.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.474
Good work, Kristen.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.347
Let's put out a wide BOLO
for Frank Cutler.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.700
It's a little too early
for a victory lap,

22:33.743 --> 22:35.441
but at least now we have a face.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.445
What?

22:39.488 --> 22:42.230
Maggie, you recognize him?

22:42.273 --> 22:45.320
No. Excuse me.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.900
This is Jason Bell
reporting live.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.945
You're the biggest nerd.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.513
Hot and cut.

23:35.762 --> 23:40.419
Hey. What's going on?

23:40.462 --> 23:42.464
Is that a picture
of Frank Cutler?

23:42.508 --> 23:45.902
- No. It's nothing.
- Maggie?

23:45.946 --> 23:48.949
Maggie, what's up?

23:48.992 --> 23:52.213
Look.

23:52.256 --> 23:56.043
The day that I lost Jason,
we were having lunch together,

23:56.086 --> 23:59.829
and I took this video of him.

23:59.873 --> 24:03.572
I don't know how many times
I've watched this, but...

24:06.967 --> 24:08.838
Is that Frank Cutler?

24:12.146 --> 24:14.888
I mean the hat's similar,

24:14.931 --> 24:16.498
but there's no scar on his neck.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.910
Yeah, but that's
just because of the angle.

24:17.934 --> 24:20.502
- OA, it's him.
- I'm not so sure.

24:20.546 --> 24:21.958
Besides, your husband died
in a car crash.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.374
So?
We thought Patterson did too.

24:23.418 --> 24:24.985
You said that he was broadsided.

24:25.028 --> 24:26.595
That the other driver

24:26.639 --> 24:29.206
went through a light,
so what are you saying?

24:29.250 --> 24:33.210
Okay. I'm saying that
that's the day Jason died,

24:33.254 --> 24:36.126
and Frank Cutler
is right there staring at him.

24:36.170 --> 24:40.087
If that's even him.
Let me ask you this.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.958
Was there any sign
of foul play with Jason?

24:42.002 --> 24:44.570
Any indication
that someone was after him?

24:45.875 --> 24:47.616
One time, I got detained by TSA,

24:47.660 --> 24:49.488
because some guy
on the terror list

24:49.531 --> 24:51.640
had my name and looked enough
like me to be my brother.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.622
This stuff happens all the time.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.885
Yeah, no, I get that,

24:55.929 --> 24:58.453
but what if this
really is Cutler?

24:58.497 --> 25:01.195
I mean he's just walking down
the street.

25:02.762 --> 25:08.158
Look, Maggie, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.074
When you lose a loved one,

25:11.118 --> 25:12.859
it's human nature
to look for answers.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.097
For a reason why.
But sometimes...

25:14.121 --> 25:15.818
All right, listen.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.579
I just asked you if you thought
it was Frank Cutler.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.866
Okay?
That's all I wanted to know.

25:22.738 --> 25:25.001
Agent Bell. We searched
the Patterson house.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.438
Nothing much stood out,
except for this.

25:27.482 --> 25:30.833
Thank you.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.009
He rented a safe deposit box.

25:33.053 --> 25:37.318
The First Central Savings Bank.
That was a week ago.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.841
Maybe whatever he put in there

25:38.885 --> 25:41.714
the killer was searching for.
All right.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.412
Let's go check it out.

25:46.501 --> 25:49.243
Maggie, may I have a moment?

25:53.334 --> 25:55.945
I'm a profiler. I read people.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.818
Is there anything
I need to know?

25:58.861 --> 26:00.733
No, ma'am.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.953
I ask because a personal bias
can affect one's instincts.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.912
Make an investigator
move forward too soon

26:05.955 --> 26:08.654
or move away too late.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.265
I'm right where I need to be
on this one.

26:11.308 --> 26:12.634
You should know that
Frank Cutler

26:12.658 --> 26:14.485
is a fake identity,

26:14.529 --> 26:16.749
but the trail of bodies
he's left is very real.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.968
- He's killed other people?
- So far we've found

26:19.012 --> 26:21.318
nine suspected
contract killings in six states

26:21.362 --> 26:23.712
where Cutler just happened
to be in the area.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.342
We're taking a fresh look
at all those cases,

26:25.366 --> 26:27.847
including the killing
of that state senator.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.389
I know you want to take
this man down, Maggie,

26:29.413 --> 26:31.894
but he is lethally dangerous.

26:31.938 --> 26:35.332
If you find out where he is,
I need you to call in SWAT.

26:35.376 --> 26:38.597
Okay.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.524
Thank you.

26:56.049 --> 26:59.966
All that's missing
is a drum roll.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.716
I don't know what I was
expecting, but it wasn't that.

27:10.759 --> 27:13.719
There's no imprint on them,
so not pharmaceutical.

27:13.762 --> 27:17.679
Street drugs?
Why rent a box to stash those?

27:17.723 --> 27:20.551
Well, maybe it'll make more
sense once the lab IDs them.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.685
I'm sorry,
but I have a situation.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.861
Mr. Patterson's here.

27:25.905 --> 27:28.690
- What?
- He wants access to his box.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.257
He has proper ID, so...

27:30.300 --> 27:33.086
Can I see that?

27:33.129 --> 27:35.741
What should I tell him?

27:35.784 --> 27:37.786
You're not gonna
tell him anything.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.180
How many customers
are in the bank right now?

27:40.223 --> 27:41.572
We were closing.

27:41.616 --> 27:42.965
Mr. Patterson
and the two of you.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.314
What about employees?

27:44.358 --> 27:45.838
Six, including me,

27:45.881 --> 27:47.796
plus the security guard.
What's going on?

27:49.493 --> 27:51.060
I know Dana said
to call in SWAT,

27:51.104 --> 27:53.062
but it's gonna take 'em
forever to get here.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.736
- Did you say SWAT?
- If she's gone too long,

27:54.760 --> 27:57.284
he's gonna start
getting suspicious.

27:59.242 --> 28:01.897
You're gonna stay here.
Do not leave.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.465
We're gonna go up there.

28:04.508 --> 28:05.988
Try not to look like feds.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.861
Excuse me.

28:12.995 --> 28:16.216
We're not gonna ask
your mother for money now.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.182
Frank Cutler, freeze.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.402
FBI. Don't move.

28:28.445 --> 28:29.490
Get down. Take cover!

28:29.533 --> 28:32.188
You too. Down!

28:32.232 --> 28:34.887
Take cover!

28:34.930 --> 28:37.628
Slowly put your hands
in the air.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.811
Put your hands in the air,
and get down on your knees,

28:45.854 --> 28:48.074
on the ground. Now.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.120
Don't turn around.

28:51.164 --> 28:53.601
Do not turn around!
Get on your knees.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.105
Get down on your knees,
on the ground,

29:00.129 --> 29:03.524
or I will shoot you.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.498
Someone call 911.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.239
Get an ambulance here
immediately.

29:41.475 --> 29:45.131
If Cutler dies,
the truth about the case...

29:45.174 --> 29:47.524
Everything he's done...
Dies with him.

29:47.568 --> 29:48.656
Maybe not.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.745
Look what I found
in his jacket pocket.

29:52.442 --> 29:54.183
Right now, the car's
the best lead we got.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.881
Yeah, and hopefully those pills.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.406
In spite of the rather
rushed timeframe,

29:59.449 --> 30:01.495
I was able to identify
the pill's active ingredient

30:01.538 --> 30:04.672
as a variant of cytarabine
which is an anti-metabolite.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.152
Very impressive.

30:06.195 --> 30:07.849
Care to translate it for me?
Yeah.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.938
It's a hot new cancer drug.
Just came out.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.548
If the pills are a cancer drug,

30:11.592 --> 30:13.333
so then why no name
or brand imprint?

30:13.376 --> 30:14.813
FDA requires that.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.336
Well, that's only once

30:16.379 --> 30:18.425
it's been made available
to the public.

30:18.468 --> 30:21.210
Okay, so maybe these ones
are for testing or drug trials?

30:21.254 --> 30:24.648
Yeah, could be.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.737
- Whoa.
- What? What is it?

30:26.781 --> 30:30.393
The results on the pill's
inactive ingredients.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.569
Something is way off.

30:35.485 --> 30:40.229
Hey, OA. I got something.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.057
Found it under the seat.

30:46.757 --> 30:49.630
Rob McCann.
The missing notebook.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.720
Yeah, well, there's a problem.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.468
Looks like some kind of code.

31:01.511 --> 31:03.687
A lot of reporters use
their own shorthand.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.689
Jason did the same thing.

31:05.733 --> 31:08.736
- You can't read it?
- There's no way.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.565
Hey, Kristen. What's up?

31:11.608 --> 31:13.697
So the pills you guys found?
It's Lucasil.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.327
It's a recently approved drug
for treating

31:15.351 --> 31:16.787
childhood leukemia.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.267
Why would Patterson have those?

31:18.311 --> 31:19.921
I don't know, but it explains

31:19.965 --> 31:21.923
why Rob was researching
pediatric oncology.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.770
Yeah, especially if there
were problems with the drug.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.274
The pills?

31:25.318 --> 31:27.102
They show impurities.
Like, serious ones.

31:27.146 --> 31:29.713
- Who makes Lucasil?
- Morrowick Medical.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.082
In fact, the drug put them
on the map.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.934
They just went public
with a huge IPO.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.043
Okay. Look into Morrowick.
Let us know what you find out.

31:35.067 --> 31:37.634
On it.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.593
You thinking what I'm thinking?

31:39.636 --> 31:42.074
Morrowick had issues
with Lucasil.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.814
Rob was gonna tell the world.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.183
And bring down the company,
so somebody

31:45.207 --> 31:46.861
hired Cutler to stop him,

31:46.905 --> 31:48.404
and the evidence might be
in this notebook.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.995
We just can't read it.

31:51.474 --> 31:54.390
Maybe Rob's wife can.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.611
It's been a while,

31:57.654 --> 31:59.743
but some of this
is coming back now.

32:01.136 --> 32:03.312
- What does it say?
- These are Rob's notes

32:03.356 --> 32:05.227
from an interview with someone.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.273
- No name.
- Q.

32:08.013 --> 32:12.278
Q. Who the hell's Q?

32:12.321 --> 32:15.107
In Jason's notes, he used
to manipulate the alphabet.

32:15.150 --> 32:20.677
What if we shift the letters
back by one character?

32:20.721 --> 32:24.290
Okay, so Q is really P,
for Patterson?

32:24.333 --> 32:26.640
Okay.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.164
Looks like this Patterson
is talking about a drug.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.211
Initial M.

32:32.254 --> 32:35.910
L? Lucasil.

32:35.954 --> 32:40.436
He's telling Rob
about a factory in China,

32:40.480 --> 32:44.092
I think, that made
a batch of tainted pills.

32:44.136 --> 32:46.027
They found the mistake,
but the pills had already

32:46.051 --> 32:48.749
been distributed
to patients in drug trials.

32:48.792 --> 32:52.274
Does Patterson say
how he knew about this?

32:54.842 --> 32:57.714
Here it is.
A major shareholder hired him,

32:57.758 --> 33:00.239
secretly, to run data

33:00.282 --> 33:03.024
to see if patients
had been affected.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.852
Were they?

33:07.768 --> 33:11.990
He found a 29%
rise in mortality.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.339
Wow.

33:15.906 --> 33:19.171
And the company kept it quiet.

33:19.214 --> 33:22.043
Yep.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.047
He wanted to go public,
to make sure no one else

33:24.089 --> 33:25.786
took the tainted drugs,

33:25.829 --> 33:29.311
but the shareholder refused
and threatened him,

33:29.355 --> 33:32.010
so he reached out to Rob.

33:35.839 --> 33:39.017
Rob was gonna expose this,
wasn't he?

33:39.060 --> 33:41.584
This was his story.

33:41.628 --> 33:44.587
In his way, he was gonna
change the world.

33:46.763 --> 33:49.418
Does it mention anything about
who the shareholder was?

33:50.550 --> 33:53.074
It's just initials again. S.E.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.902
Which is really R.D.

33:54.945 --> 33:57.209
We know who that is.
Patterson's friend.

34:00.951 --> 34:03.432
Russell Donovan
of Donovan Partners.

34:03.476 --> 34:06.740
The VC firm that invested
big in Morrowick Medical.

34:06.783 --> 34:09.873
We hit his home and office,
but he's in the wind.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.484
Now, a little context here.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.572
Not only did Donovan
hire Cutler,

34:13.616 --> 34:15.444
but he also gave meds
to cancer patients

34:15.487 --> 34:18.404
without bothering to mention
they were contaminated.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.362
Let's lean on his family,
his colleagues.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.190
Let's issue
another round of BOLOs.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.105
Let's find this dirt bag.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.541
Hey.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.326
Tell me you have
a 20 on Donovan.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.154
I just found
a satellite office in Brooklyn

34:29.197 --> 34:30.938
where Donovan parks his chopper.

34:30.981 --> 34:33.723
Pilot just filed a flight plan
for Montreal.

34:33.766 --> 34:35.985
He's making a run
for the border.

34:54.483 --> 34:58.052
Russell Donovan,
we need a few words.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.186
- I've done nothing wrong.
- Really?

35:01.229 --> 35:03.797
What about the tainted pills
in the cancer trials?

35:03.840 --> 35:07.670
There's no proof of that.

35:07.714 --> 35:09.672
We have Rob McCann's notebook.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.631
That has the whole story.

35:11.674 --> 35:14.677
And we have two payments of
100 grand to Frank Cutler

35:14.721 --> 35:17.811
that we tracked back to you.

35:19.726 --> 35:23.077
You can direct any further
questions to my attorney.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.385
Russell Donovan,
you're under arrest.

35:32.173 --> 35:36.003
- Good work out there today.
- I'm sorry.

35:36.046 --> 35:37.744
I know you said to call in SWAT,

35:37.787 --> 35:40.442
but I was worried that
we would have lost Cutler.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.531
Well, we might lose him anyway.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.794
He's out of surgery,
but it's touch-and-go.

35:47.493 --> 35:50.670
You faced down
a monster today, Maggie.

35:50.713 --> 35:54.500
A case a little too
close to home.

35:54.543 --> 35:56.632
How are you?

35:56.676 --> 36:00.114
I'm fine.

36:05.511 --> 36:08.253
I used to think that things
would never catch up to me.

36:08.296 --> 36:11.256
I don't want to see you
make the same mistake.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.698
This woman helped me
through things.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.313
She can help you too.

36:27.924 --> 36:31.363
Thanks.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.329
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:46.247 --> 36:50.512
Um, listen, so I've been
looking into Cutler.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.864
That's definitely him
in your video.

36:54.908 --> 36:56.866
He was in New York.

37:00.870 --> 37:04.700
Maybe it's what you said.
He was just walking by.

37:04.744 --> 37:08.008
Yeah. That's what I thought too.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.097
But then I looked
into his financials

37:10.140 --> 37:12.839
and a wire transfer
for 100 grand

37:12.882 --> 37:15.755
hit his account
the day Jason died.

37:21.456 --> 37:25.808
You were right.
Maggie, he was involved.

37:51.921 --> 37:53.358
I'm sorry. You can't be in here.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.447
This man is critically ill.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.797
I need the room. Get out.

38:02.584 --> 38:06.153
Cutler, wake up.

38:06.196 --> 38:09.417
You remember me?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.767
Not just from the bank
though, right?

38:13.639 --> 38:17.904
Last year. I was sitting
at a café on Amsterdam.

38:17.947 --> 38:20.385
I was with my husband.

38:26.042 --> 38:31.178
Jason.
I was sitting there with Jason.

38:35.965 --> 38:39.404
That's you. Isn't it?

38:43.146 --> 38:47.847
You killed my husband.

38:47.890 --> 38:51.546
Why did you do it?

38:51.590 --> 38:53.679
Look at me.

38:53.722 --> 38:57.204
Why did you kill my husband?

38:59.206 --> 39:03.863
Do you even understand
what you took from me?

39:05.604 --> 39:08.737
The life that we were
going to have?

39:15.875 --> 39:18.878
Who hired you?

39:20.836 --> 39:23.665
Do one decent thing right now,

39:23.709 --> 39:27.495
and tell me who hired you.

39:32.892 --> 39:37.723
Please. Please tell me.

39:38.419 --> 39:41.596
Tell me.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.729
Cutler.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.954
- I'm sorry. You need to leave.
- What's happening?

39:51.998 --> 39:54.392
His BP's cratering.
Vessel may have opened up.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.481
Let's run a CT angio,
and prep the OR.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.787
- Where are you going?
- Back into surgery.

39:58.831 --> 40:01.181
If we're lucky,
we can save his life.

40:01.224 --> 40:02.835
Where's the OR doctor on call?

40:02.878 --> 40:05.185
- Dr. Denton!
- I'm right here.

40:05.228 --> 40:07.579
Page Denton.

40:40.525 --> 40:44.877
I keep thinking about
how Jason wanted to have kids.

40:46.574 --> 40:50.970
I was the one
that wanted to wait.

40:51.013 --> 40:53.755
I was worried about my career
or whatever.

40:57.672 --> 41:00.588
I just wish I'd have taken
that leap, you know?

41:03.373 --> 41:06.464
Then maybe part of him
would still be with me.

41:08.553 --> 41:11.599
Or if I was at home pregnant,

41:11.643 --> 41:13.862
he wouldn't have been
on the road that night.

41:19.607 --> 41:22.305
What happened to him
is not on you.

41:24.264 --> 41:27.310
How did I not see
that it wasn't an accident?

41:28.660 --> 41:32.272
How could you? No one else did.

41:32.315 --> 41:37.233
I'm an FBI agent.
I should have seen the signs.

41:37.277 --> 41:41.020
Not if there weren't any.

41:51.073 --> 41:53.815
OA, I think
I've been too afraid to look.

41:59.168 --> 42:02.781
To really face that he's gone.

42:09.135 --> 42:12.051
Did you know that I still have

42:12.094 --> 42:15.141
all of his clothes
in his closet?

42:18.144 --> 42:20.494
I just don't open the door.

42:26.848 --> 42:29.851
Wherever this goes...

42:32.680 --> 42:34.377
I'm with you.

42:37.729 --> 42:40.427
Agent Bell?

42:45.911 --> 42:49.349
I'm sorry, but Mr. Cutler
didn't make it.
