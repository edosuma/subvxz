00:58.880 --> 01:00.080
[grunts and groans]

01:00.560 --> 01:02.640
<i>...especially in the arena...</i>

01:02.720 --> 01:05.640
-[cheering]
<i>-...the Robozuna arena.</i>

01:07.240 --> 01:12.080
<i>Robozuna is the ultimate</i>
<i>bots-battling-bots competition.</i>

01:12.800 --> 01:15.160
<i>And these bots are special.</i>

01:15.240 --> 01:17.160
<i>They’re called Combatabots.</i>

01:17.240 --> 01:18.200
[grunts]

01:22.480 --> 01:24.240
Sorry, that ball is mine.

01:46.680 --> 01:47.520

02:00.280 --> 02:02.040

02:03.360 --> 02:08.000

[laughs]

02:12.680 --> 02:16.320
<i>And the big guy next to me,</i>

02:16.400 --> 02:17.720
[chuckles and grunts]

02:17.800 --> 02:22.640
<i>Mangle’s just a workbot. He helps us out.</i>
<i>Does the jobs us humans can’t do.</i>

02:22.720 --> 02:23.800
...today, Mangle.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.960
<i>He’s not a Combatabot...</i>

02:30.360 --> 02:31.600

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
Hm.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.360
[crowd chant] Robozuna!

02:36.440 --> 02:41.640
<i>Which is why it’s so hard to believe I put</i>

02:42.840 --> 02:47.680
<i>And believe me, I’ve gotten Mangle</i>
<i>into some pretty tough situations before.</i>

02:56.800 --> 02:59.760

Spark! Get close, you’re toast!
The taser-jab!

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
Clunk!

04:25.960 --> 04:26.920
Uh...

04:27.000 --> 04:29.200
the Clunk-a-matic!

04:31.880 --> 04:35.040
Uh, excuse me. Uh, what’s going on?

04:35.120 --> 04:36.480
Robozuna try-outs.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.160
Team Veredus need another Combatabot
in their line-up for tomorrow’s game.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.040
If a bot takes the ball away
from one of their players,

04:43.120 --> 04:45.960
it can join their team.
Gets to become a Combatabot!

04:46.960 --> 04:48.000
Whoa!

04:50.720 --> 04:53.280
I've dreamed about Mangle
becoming a Combatabot

04:53.360 --> 04:55.560
and he’d have no problem taking the ball.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.760
All he’d have to do is swing around,
grab it and... Ow!

05:03.760 --> 05:07.200
Come on, Mangle, think about it.
You wouldn’t have to work anymore.

05:07.280 --> 05:12.160
-We’d... You’d kind of be famous.
-Mangle protect.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Ah!

05:15.840 --> 05:16.680
[sighs]

05:16.760 --> 05:20.560
Look, Mangle, I know you’re programmed
to protect me, but really?

05:20.640 --> 05:23.080
You’re afraid I’m going to get stepped on?
Huh!

05:24.200 --> 05:27.240
-Mangle...
-Protect. I know. I know.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.640
And where do you think you’re going?
We’ve got a job to do, remember?

05:33.200 --> 05:34.160
The barrels?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.360
[sighs]

05:35.440 --> 05:36.880
Right. I'm on it.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.080
Mangle, grab 'em up.

05:46.040 --> 05:49.640
Feronia, my favourite customer.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.080
And Ariston! How are you and Mangle doing?

05:53.400 --> 05:56.320
We’re good, thanks.
Mangle’s about to join a Robozuna team,

05:56.400 --> 05:57.560
become a Combatabot.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.080
Oh, is he, now?

05:59.160 --> 06:03.160
No, Mangle isn’t, now.
Rafie, I need a drill-bit.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.880
Trade you for some machine juice?

06:06.240 --> 06:11.160
Hm. These Corvus certifications...
look like forgeries to me.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.280
[sighs]

06:12.360 --> 06:14.360
But very good forgeries.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.000
[both laugh]

06:16.080 --> 06:19.000
You know, Corvus patrols
are everywhere these days.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.720
-Where are you drilling?
-We're near the Ridge Road.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.840
-We don’t plan to stay long.
-Very well.

06:25.920 --> 06:29.560
Let’s see what I have for you...
my favourite customer.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.520
-[both laugh]
-[smashing]

06:31.600 --> 06:32.800
[sighs]

06:32.880 --> 06:35.200
[grunts angrily] Out, you two!

06:35.280 --> 06:37.200
I’m going to have to pay for that now!

06:37.280 --> 06:38.280
[sighs]

06:40.880 --> 06:45.160
Look, Mangle, a workbot is trying out
for Team Veredus.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.640
[electronic grunt]

06:47.720 --> 06:49.280
[buzzing]

06:49.960 --> 06:51.960
Oh, you’re a big bot.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.280
[buzzing]

06:54.640 --> 06:56.680
Are those beard trimmers?

06:57.440 --> 07:01.560
He worked in our barbershop...
before Corvus closed it down.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.040
[buzzing]

07:03.120 --> 07:06.240
Well, here’s your chance
for a brighter tomorrow.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.680
-You, sir!
-Yeah, yeah, what?

07:09.040 --> 07:10.720
Mm, you look like you work out.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.320
Mind throwing that thudball over to Spark?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.800
[chuckles] I got this!

07:14.880 --> 07:19.480
[grunts] It’s too... heavy.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.160
Never mind. I got it.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.800
-[crowd gasp]
-Whoa!

07:28.760 --> 07:30.320
Double whoa!

07:32.640 --> 07:34.680
It’s not magic, folks.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.120
It’s my Magnagrip glove.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.000
Created by yours truly.
Here you go, Spark, catch.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.880
Oh-ho-ho!

07:42.960 --> 07:46.560
Whoa! Hold on there, big guy.
Hmm. You want this?

07:47.120 --> 07:50.720
Or maybe you want this! The taser-jab!

07:52.160 --> 07:54.360
[electronic groan]

07:55.240 --> 07:56.080
Ooh!

07:56.480 --> 07:58.040
He’s had a close shave!

07:58.120 --> 08:00.320
[guffaws]

08:04.200 --> 08:05.120
Next!

08:05.440 --> 08:06.440
Let’s go.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.200
Hey, hey, how about your workbot?

08:09.280 --> 08:12.840
No, no. It’s okay,
I thought for a second that--

08:12.920 --> 08:15.040
He’s big! He looks tough enough.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.160
Wait! Honestly? You think
he could become a Combatabot?

08:18.240 --> 08:21.400
Yeah, sure, he can face... Clunk.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.760
Clunk. Ah. The Clunk-a-matic!

08:25.840 --> 08:27.440
Clunk’s a real softy.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.000
Couldn’t hurt to try.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.080
Of course not!

08:30.160 --> 08:31.600
[grunts]

08:32.120 --> 08:34.320
Go on, Mangle, grab the thudball!

08:34.400 --> 08:35.440
[grunts]

08:35.800 --> 08:38.880
That’s it! You got it! Now, take it away!

08:42.040 --> 08:43.960
[grunts and groans]

08:44.040 --> 08:47.640
Clunk, Clunk, Clunk, Clunk, Clunk,
Clunk, Clunk, Clunk, Clunk, Clunk!

08:47.720 --> 08:49.080
-[grunts]
-Clunk.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.800
Oh.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.960
[grunts]

08:53.480 --> 08:55.440
[groans]

08:55.920 --> 08:57.960
The Clunk-a-matic!

08:58.320 --> 09:02.360
Look, sorry, maybe your workbot
just needs a little practice.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.880
[groans]

09:05.960 --> 09:07.000
How about this?

09:07.080 --> 09:11.200
Stop by the Botrus Arena bright and early
tomorrow and you can watch us train.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.080
Uh... okay, thanks.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.200
You did good, Mangle. Almost had him.

09:18.080 --> 09:18.960
Hm.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.400
So, then, who’s next?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.880
Oh, come on!

09:30.160 --> 09:33.120
Ariston, we don’t need
this kind of attention right now.

09:39.480 --> 09:43.440
Just once, I’d like to think I could leave
you two alone without having to worry.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.200
Yeah. Probably what
my parents would’ve said.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.640
Not going to happen.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.120
[tuts and sighs]

09:49.200 --> 09:52.400
[engine revs and tyres screech]

09:56.600 --> 09:58.640
Oh, you should have seen Mangle.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.440
Boy, did he have the moves!
He just grabbed that thudball and then...

10:02.520 --> 10:03.840
Ow!

10:03.920 --> 10:05.720
Mangle... protect?

10:05.800 --> 10:10.640
No, Mangle.
And then... well, Mangle got mashed.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.360
But he could be a Combatabot.
Right, buddy?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.240
Huh... Hm.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.120
-[explosion]
-[both gasp]

10:17.200 --> 10:18.120
[Mangle gasps]

10:21.800 --> 10:24.360
[sighs] Another Corvus attack.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.320
If their patrols
discover our drilling operation...

10:27.400 --> 10:30.360
Well, you know how dangerous that can be.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.400
In their eyes, we’re outlaws.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.080
Outlaws? But we’re the good guys.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.360
Machine juice belongs to the people.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.240
You’re right, but Corvus controls
this land, its resources,

10:41.320 --> 10:44.120
and they have an army of Centurions
to take it from us.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.360
If people want fuel, food,
they have to pay for it...

10:47.440 --> 10:50.280
[sighs] one way or another.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.960
[tyres squeal]

11:04.080 --> 11:05.160
[sighs]

11:05.640 --> 11:09.440
Another beautiful day
for the Corvus Imperium.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.200
Don’t you agree, Your Highness Danuvia?

11:16.760 --> 11:21.760
Yes. Your Centurions have done well,
Commander Vermis.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.480
My father shall be pleased.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.560
You know, I don’t understand it.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.880
You’d think these pathetic drillers
would learn their lesson.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.480
[grunting and groaning]

11:36.360 --> 11:40.160
Yet they continue to steal from us.
[chuckles]

11:40.240 --> 11:42.160
Or at least they try.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.240
So annoying.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.200
[Mangle grunts]

11:52.320 --> 11:55.040
-[grunts]
-Oh, thank you, Mangle.

11:55.120 --> 11:59.040
With this new drill-bit, we should get
what we came for in no time.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.120
Good, because that’s exactly
what we have: no time.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.360
We pump a dozen barrels
and then we get out of here,

12:06.440 --> 12:10.560
find a permanent home,
some place safe... if that exists.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.960
-Sounds like a plan, boss.
-[grunts]

12:13.200 --> 12:16.080
-Oh!
-Come on, Mangle, fight back!

12:16.160 --> 12:18.000
Pretend we’re playing Robozuna. Ha!

12:18.480 --> 12:21.480
We’re Combatabots, and I’m trying
to take a thudball away from you.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.080
You know that’s not what
Mangle’s programmed for.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.480
Put his arm back in your workshop
and go and help Niven.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.720
And, Mangle, go and fetch a dozen
empty barrels for the trailer.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.720
All right! Let’s get drilling!

12:45.320 --> 12:46.280
Huh?

12:49.280 --> 12:52.960
[gasps]

12:53.040 --> 12:54.360
Mangle protect!

12:57.640 --> 12:58.720
Ariston!

12:58.800 --> 12:59.720
[gasps]

13:01.320 --> 13:02.400
Look out!

13:03.280 --> 13:04.600
[grunts]

13:07.600 --> 13:08.680
[gasps]

13:09.840 --> 13:10.840
[Ariston groans]

13:12.520 --> 13:14.440
Ariston, are you okay?

13:14.520 --> 13:18.400
Yeah. I’m fine. Not a scratch.
Thanks, Mangle.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.080
Good job, Mangle.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.280
[groans] My comm-unit, broken!

13:23.360 --> 13:26.560
Don’t worry about that now.
You can fix that tonight.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.480
We need to fix the rig first.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.120
But I can’t fix that.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.560
No, but Mangle can. [sighs]

13:33.640 --> 13:36.000
Looks like we’ll be here longer
than we wanted to.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.640
It'll be okay, boss.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.800
Whoa! Since when did Mangle learn to weld?

13:44.880 --> 13:48.840
Since I updated his programming.
I wanted to surprise you.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.880
Cool addition, huh? The flash welder!

13:53.000 --> 13:53.880
[chuckles]

13:53.960 --> 13:57.320
Mangle’s got a lot of potential.
You know that, right?

13:57.400 --> 13:59.600
Come on,
you better get his arm reattached.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.720
Yeah. Let’s go, Mangle.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.360
All right, let’s try this again!

14:09.480 --> 14:11.080
-Hm.
-[Mangle grunts]

14:12.040 --> 14:14.400
Trust me, Mangle, I know what I’m doing.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.360
-Feronia’s taught me a lot.
-[grunts]

14:16.440 --> 14:17.960
There, good as new.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.320
[grunts contentedly]

14:21.640 --> 14:24.640
Now, let’s test it.
How about crushing one of those cans?

14:26.640 --> 14:27.880
-Squish.
-Argh!

14:28.600 --> 14:31.160
Oh! Machine juice!

14:31.240 --> 14:34.840
Hm. Maybe not one of my brightest ideas.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.040
Hm.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.600
Hey! I’ve had tons of bright ideas.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.280
Hm.

14:40.360 --> 14:44.440
Well, I did help Feronia build you.
That counts as one bright idea.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.120
[grunts happily]

14:47.600 --> 14:48.880
[laughs]

14:48.960 --> 14:49.960
[Mangle grunts]

14:51.640 --> 14:52.960
-[grunts]
-[laughs]

14:53.040 --> 14:54.960
-[grunts and laughs]
-Blah!

14:55.920 --> 14:58.120
-Whoa! [laughs]
-[laughs]

14:58.200 --> 15:00.560
Okay, okay, Mangle, enough.
You win. You win.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.880
Right, you charge your power cells.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.960
I’ll get cleaned up and get some sleep.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.880
You saved my life today, Mangle.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.600
You really are the best...
the best friend anyone could have.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.360
Hm.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.240
Hm.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.680
Hm. [sighs]

15:25.760 --> 15:26.920
Feronia...

15:27.000 --> 15:28.240
Yes?

15:28.320 --> 15:31.120
So, what is in that box?

15:31.200 --> 15:33.520
Just something I’ve been working on
for Mangle,

15:33.600 --> 15:36.480
another surprise addition,
if I can complete it.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.360
Hm. You ever wish there was no Corvus?

15:40.640 --> 15:43.800
I do, but the only way
for there not to be a Corvus

15:43.880 --> 15:45.920
is if people join together to fight them,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.720
and that’s not going to happen
when Corvus has them divided,

15:48.800 --> 15:52.000
fighting against each other
in their Robozuna games.

15:52.080 --> 15:57.120
You know, if Mangle were a Combatabot,
I’d bet he’d become a champion.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.480
[sighs]

15:58.560 --> 16:00.000
Good night, Ariston.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.640
Good night, Feronia.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.240
[bleeping and door opens]

16:22.120 --> 16:24.480
[engine revs]

16:27.120 --> 16:29.040
[Ariston whoops and laughs]

16:29.120 --> 16:31.880
Botrus Arena, here we come!

16:31.960 --> 16:33.280
Hm.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.960
Don’t worry, Mangle. We’ll be back
before anyone notices we’re gone.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.480
I know a shortcut.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.520
Oh, oh, oh!

16:49.880 --> 16:51.000
Get up!

16:51.560 --> 16:54.360
Huh? What? Why are you here?

16:55.160 --> 16:57.800
Those barrels, who did you get them from?

16:57.880 --> 17:00.440
I, uh... I can’t remember.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.320
Extremely busy day yesterday.
You wouldn’t believe how many people...

17:04.400 --> 17:05.880
[yells in fear]

17:16.080 --> 17:17.360
Where are we going?

17:17.440 --> 17:19.400
To see Commander Vermis.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.040
[gasps softly] No!

17:32.040 --> 17:34.960
So what if you’re not programmed
to be a Combatabot?

17:35.040 --> 17:37.880
Maybe there’s some other job
you can do for Team Veredus!

17:37.960 --> 17:40.600
Like, I don’t know, use your flash welder.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.880
Put bots back together
when they get smashed up.

17:42.960 --> 17:43.960
Uh!

17:50.280 --> 17:54.760
Our shortcut, Mangle. Corvus Workcamp.
Nothing to worry about.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.000
We won’t go near it.
I’ve used this perimeter road before.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.760
Oh, and hold on, Mangle.
This could get a little bumpy.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.680
[Mangle yells]

18:04.800 --> 18:06.080
[tyres squeal]

18:08.640 --> 18:10.440
[Mangle yells]

18:10.520 --> 18:12.640
[laughs] Told you!

18:21.800 --> 18:24.960
-[engine revs]
-[Ariston whoops and laughs]

18:25.440 --> 18:27.800
-Hold tight, big crater ahead!
-Uh!

18:34.000 --> 18:35.960
-Woo-hoo!
-[Mangle grunts]

18:38.360 --> 18:39.440
[yells]

18:42.240 --> 18:43.080
[groans]

18:43.160 --> 18:45.280
[Ariston laughs] Made it!

18:46.480 --> 18:47.680
Want to do it again?

18:49.160 --> 18:51.320
Hm, guess I’m going to have to.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.440
[engine revs and tyres screech]

18:57.440 --> 18:58.840
[grunts]

19:03.120 --> 19:04.280
[tyres screech]

19:05.040 --> 19:08.280
[laughs] One day, you’ll listen
when I tell you to do something.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.040
Huh.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.320
First couple times, I cut across
this crater, flipped the bike.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.960
But never gave up!

19:15.760 --> 19:17.240
Got it down now!

19:17.320 --> 19:19.120
[sighs and grunts]

19:20.760 --> 19:22.720
[engine revs and Mangle grunts]

19:26.640 --> 19:29.080
Botrus Arena is just behind that ridge.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.080
Won’t be long now.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.000
Uh...

19:43.160 --> 19:44.800
[both grunt]

19:44.880 --> 19:47.000
[both yell]

19:50.720 --> 19:51.640
[groans]

19:52.400 --> 19:53.920
Mangle, are you okay?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.760
[groans]

19:55.840 --> 20:00.680
Good... but not so good Corvus are
now booby-trapping this whole area.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.960
But could’ve been a lot worse.

20:05.080 --> 20:05.920
Uh...

20:07.400 --> 20:09.160
And now it is a lot worse.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.560
Mangle, need a little help here.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.560
Mangle protect.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.080
That’s great, but right now
need to get this ready to roll.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.000
Good. Now, see what you can do
with those handlebars.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.280
Hm.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.600
Perfect.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.080
I got this.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.480
You’re wondering if I have a plan,
right, Mangle?

20:38.560 --> 20:39.400
Huh?

20:41.720 --> 20:43.280
Okay, not so much a plan.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.160
-More a crazy idea kind of thing!
-Huh.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.120
Any second now,
I’m going to need protecting. Got it?

20:49.720 --> 20:50.840
Hm.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.480
Now, Mangle, now!

21:00.800 --> 21:03.080
-Mangle protect?
-Mangle protect!

21:12.880 --> 21:15.600
-Now, that’s what I’m talking about!
-Huh!

21:15.680 --> 21:17.640
[engines rev and tyres squeal]

21:17.720 --> 21:18.960
[gasps and groans]

21:21.440 --> 21:24.880
You’re going to love this, Mangle!
I’ve had an even crazier idea!

21:24.960 --> 21:26.560
Here we go again!

21:26.640 --> 21:28.400
-[engine revs]
-[Mangle grunts]

21:30.760 --> 21:32.720
[engines rev and tyres squeal]
