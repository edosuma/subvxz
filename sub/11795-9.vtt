   This week is our
   geometry midterm.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.816
  Hey, I'm not worried, because
  I always sit
  next to smart nerds.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.821
  -Hey, guys. How're you doing?
  -Hey.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.825
Yuck!
I hate coffee.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.994
 Susie, can I have
 another cup, please?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.429
 So, why are you drinking it?

01:36.463 --> 01:39.199
What else would she do
with the coffee, Zack?

01:39.232 --> 01:43.436
  Use your head as a donut,
  and dunk you in it.

01:43.470 --> 01:48.108
 No way. My head would
 never fit in the cup.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.844
  I'm drinking
  coffee to stay awake.
  I've been up half the night

01:50.877 --> 01:53.279
   studying for geometry,
   and I still don't get it.

01:53.313 --> 01:55.248
Come on,
you're doing all right.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.350
   Look,
   I want to go to Stanford,

01:57.384 --> 02:00.787
  and there are people with
  straight A's who
  get turned down.

02:03.089 --> 02:06.192
Send back the coffee,
it's hopeless.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.228
 -What's up guys?
 -Hey, Slater.

02:08.261 --> 02:11.197
  Cramming your pretty
  little head with geometry?

02:11.231 --> 02:13.767
   Is there a sexist point
   to your question?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.670
Well, yeah.
Guys are great at math.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.873
  It's just a shame you
  weren't born a man.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.942
   Yeah, it's a shame you
   weren't born one, either.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.318
Hi, guys.
How's it going?

02:33.520 --> 02:35.755
 Hey, Jessie, listen.
<i>I'm So Excited.</i>

02:35.789 --> 02:38.258
  I know you're excited,
  but try to forget about me.

02:39.859 --> 02:41.361
  I'll pray for help.

02:41.394 --> 02:44.097
 Jessie, put the books away.
 The test isn't until Friday.

02:44.097 --> 02:49.102
 -Come on.
 -Relax. Let's show her, okay?

03:08.388 --> 03:10.056
 See?

03:10.056 --> 03:12.058
  -All right.
  -Get down, ladies!

03:12.058 --> 03:13.793
   -You guys are great.
   -Yeah.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.062
 Hey, a friend of my dad
 is a record producer,

03:16.062 --> 03:18.064
  and he's looking
  for a girls' group
  like New Kids on the Block.

03:18.098 --> 03:21.267
 Yeah,
 the "New Chicks on the Block."

03:23.069 --> 03:27.173
Thank you,
"New Pig in the Booth."

03:27.207 --> 03:30.076
 You guys are terrific.
 I'll be your
 manager. We'll make a fortune.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.312
 Oh, come on,
 we were just fooling around.

03:32.345 --> 03:35.081
   Let me bring you to the
   recording company and you
   can sing for them.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.818
  I don't have time. Besides,
  we just like to sing in
  the locker room.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.856
  Why not bring the producer
  to the girls' locker room?

03:42.889 --> 03:46.092
 Why not go to the boys' room
 and flush yourself to China?

03:46.459 --> 03:49.095
Mr. Morris, B+.

03:49.095 --> 03:53.299
   Should I congratulate you
   or the person who was
   sitting next to you?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.236
  Sir, I am shocked.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.805
 Lighten up, Z-person.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.373
  Kelly, B+.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.742
   Lisa, B+.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.345
  Jessie, C.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.481
 C? C?

04:08.515 --> 04:13.920
 C, <i>senorita.</i>
 But this is geometry,
 not Spanish.

04:13.953 --> 04:15.922
( bell rings )

04:15.955 --> 04:19.826
   Study hard.
   I'm off to my tryouts
   for <i>American Gladiators.</i>

04:23.430 --> 04:25.532
 A "C?"
 I'll never get into Stanford.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.967
  Will you calm down?
  It's only one quiz.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.236
  That's right, Jessie.
  You can make it
  up on the midterm.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.839
   Hurry or you'll
   be late for gym.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.375
   Look, Jessie, if you're
   worried about that test,

04:35.408 --> 04:37.277
 I'll help you study.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.512
Okay. My house at 7:00?

04:39.546 --> 04:41.214
I'll be there.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.516
  And stop worrying,
  you're pretty
  smart for a chick.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.285
 -Slater!
 -See?

04:45.318 --> 04:47.420
 Got your mind off it already.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.323
  Screech, get your recorder.
  You're going to
  the girl's locker room.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.525
 -Why?
 -That's where the girls sing.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.461
   We're gonna record them.

04:54.494 --> 04:58.865
 Oh, no. Do I have to wear
 your Aunt Helen's bra again?

05:02.502 --> 05:04.804
  Does anyone know how
  to bisect the vertex angle

05:04.838 --> 05:06.806
   of an isosceles triangle?

05:06.840 --> 05:09.542
  Will you stop it, Jessie?
  You're gonna
  make yourself sick.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.519
  You know what, Jessie?
  Don't worry,
  everything's gonna be okay.

05:19.552 --> 05:23.490
 It's just
 geometry makes me feel
 so stupid. I'm so depressed.

05:23.523 --> 05:27.293
Whenever I'm depressed,
lassie, I sing a song.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.330
   That's a great idea, Jessie.
   Let's have some fun.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.965
  -Who are you?
  -Who am I?

05:32.065 --> 05:34.234
   Oh, I'm... I'm...

05:34.267 --> 05:37.537
   Sinead O'Connor.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.539
 That's a very famous name...

05:39.572 --> 05:43.109
 That's the other O'Connor.
 She's my niece.
 She learned from me.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.111
 You taught her
 everything she knows?

05:45.145 --> 05:48.448
 Oh, that I did.
 Now she can clean
 toilets with the best of them.

05:50.250 --> 05:54.120
   Come on, lassies,
   let's cheer up and sing.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.089
   Oh, and don't mind me,
   I'll just mop around you.

06:02.328 --> 06:05.198
 <i>* And I just can't hide it. *</i>

06:05.231 --> 06:07.334
 Angle A is
 congruent to angle D,

06:07.367 --> 06:11.471
 because these alternate
 interior angles are congruent.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.441
   Will you marry me,
   and take the test for me?

06:15.508 --> 06:18.611
  You are in trouble.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.080
  So anyway, look...

06:20.113 --> 06:23.483
  Hi. How you guys doing?
  I have great news.

06:23.516 --> 06:27.287
Mr. Dewey got squashed
by a gladiator?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.389
  No, better.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.292
 The record producer loved
 the tape of you girls singing,

06:32.325 --> 06:34.327
 and wants to play it
 for his boss.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.596
   -Hey, that's great!
   -What tape, Zack?

06:36.629 --> 06:39.666
  Oh, the one of you girls
  singing in the locker room.

06:39.699 --> 06:42.669
  -We didn't make a tape.
  -Oh, you're wrong, lassie.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.638
 Sinead O'Connor did.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.974
   You violated our privacy?

06:48.074 --> 06:51.211
   That's disgusting,
   isn't it, Slater?

06:51.244 --> 06:55.482
 Oh, yeah. Disgusting, Preppie.
 I'm very disappointed in you.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.151
  Next time bring me.

06:58.184 --> 06:59.652
   The producer thinks
   you're the best.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.655
   Well, it doesn't matter.
   There's a principle here.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.359
 He really thinks I'm the best?

07:06.393 --> 07:09.262
  Yeah.
  But don't tell Lisa or Kelly.
  They'll get jealous.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.264
   -See you guys, have fun.
   -Later, man.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.135
Let's get on to
parallel lines.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.638
  Jessie, I'm wiped. We've been
  at this for four hours now.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.640
I'm tired, too.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.475
  Oh.

07:22.509 --> 07:25.178
   Here, take one of these.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.347
  Keep Alert?
  What are these for?

07:27.380 --> 07:30.383
   I need them to stay awake
   to study. I got them today
   at the drugstore.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.753
  They're just like coffee,
  except they
  don't taste as bad.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.489
 Jessie, these are a lot
 stronger than coffee.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.059
   It says here they may be
   habit-forming.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.361
They're harmless. They sell
them over the counter.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.497
 That doesn't make them safe.
 You shouldn't be taking these.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.332
  Maybe you're right.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.069
All right then.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.338
Well, see you tomorrow.
Good night.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.440
  Good night.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.643
 -Slater?
 -Yes?

08:03.016 --> 08:05.151
   Thank you for helping me.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.388
   I'll never wash
   these lips again.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.827
  What am I gonna do?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.063
Jessie, you haven't even
taken the midterm yet.

08:50.096 --> 08:53.233
 But I know
 what's gonna happen.
 I'll never get into Stanford.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.367
Oh, calm down, Jessie.

08:54.401 --> 08:57.170
 I will write a great letter of
 recommendation for you.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.872
 You almost have
 a straight A average.

08:58.905 --> 09:02.008
 Almost is not good
 enough for Stanford.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.312
  If it will make
  you feel any better,
  I got a C in geometry, too.

09:06.346 --> 09:10.150
-Did you go to Stanford?
-Heck no,
they wouldn't take me.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.018
   I want to go to Stanford.

09:12.018 --> 09:16.022
 I wanted to marry Christie
 Brinkley,
 but it didn't happen.

09:16.022 --> 09:19.025
 Look, there are lots of
 other good colleges.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.894
I'll help you find one.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.363
 Believe it or not,
 there's even
 a college out there for Zack.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.366
 If I flunk geometry, that's
 probably where I'll wind up.

09:38.945 --> 09:40.780
 Zack?

09:40.814 --> 09:43.350
Hey, Jessie. I thought you
were going to Stanford.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.385
I got a C in geometry.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.055

   place that would take me.

 than sunblock 15.

  Zack, you have to help me
  get out of here.

10:20.186 --> 10:23.056
   Well, you'll have to speak
   to the Dean of Students.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.824

  sure you'll end up at

   no matter what it takes.

 What if they don't choose us?

14:04.411 --> 14:07.313
   Jessie, the recording
   company loves our video!

14:07.347 --> 14:09.883
 -They want to see
 us perform live.
 -Yeah, it's all set.

14:09.916 --> 14:13.053
The producer's coming to
The Max tomorrow night
to see you guys.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.488
  -Hey, that's great.
  -Yeah, we rehearse tonight.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.259
I can't tonight.
I have to study.
Tomorrow's the midterm.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.428
 Jessie, hey,
 I'll sit next to you,

14:21.461 --> 14:23.229
  and you can copy off of me.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.566
 I may as well take poison now.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.202
   Come on.
   It won't take that long.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.105
 And you're ready
 for that test, Jess.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.073
 Okay.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.176
I'll rehearse and then
I'll study afterwards.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.244
( bell rings )

14:38.278 --> 14:41.281
  There's this quiz in English,
  you got a pen I can borrow?

14:41.314 --> 14:44.150
There's one in my book bag.
Help yourself.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.524
  What are these doing here?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.660
   I believe you were
   looking for this.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.365
 -Jessie,
 those pills are dangerous.
 -Yeah, well, so is geometry.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.333
You told me you were
gonna stop taking them.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.702
  I need them to stay awake
  and study, okay?

15:02.736 --> 15:05.038
  No, it's not okay.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.406
  I'm worried about you.
  Give me the pills.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.508
Mind your own business!

15:14.247 --> 15:18.051
  Great earrings.
  Ask me anything
  about geometry, I'm ready!

15:18.051 --> 15:20.253
 -Jessie, are you all right?
 -Great, wonderful, terrific!

15:20.286 --> 15:23.056
  Check this out, the square of
  the hypotenuse of
  a right triangle

15:23.089 --> 15:26.059
 is equal to
 the sums of the square
 of the other two sides, baby!

15:26.092 --> 15:28.428
-Yeah!
-( bell rings )

15:44.944 --> 15:46.980
   Are you sure you don't
   want to check this over?

15:47.080 --> 15:50.984
 No, Mr. Dewey, I aced it,
 I know it. I really studied.

15:51.084 --> 15:55.822
 Did you get number six right?
 Even I couldn't figure it out.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.091
The square root
of AB over two.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.326
Thanks, Jessie.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.462
( bell rings )

16:10.236 --> 16:12.105
  Hey,
  Preppie, you got a minute?

16:12.138 --> 16:15.041
  Yeah, make it quick. I gotta
  head over to the Max
  for rehearsals.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.210
 My girls are singing tonight.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.478
Come here, man.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.484
 Hey, look.
 Jessie has a problem.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.820
  I think she's taking drugs.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.356
  Drugs?
  What are you crazy?

16:29.389 --> 16:32.359
 She's been
 taking caffeine pills
 to stay up all night cramming.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.128
 -I think she's hooked on them.
 -Look,
 they're probably vitamins.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.130
   -Jessie's too
   smart to take drugs.
   -Zack!

16:37.163 --> 16:40.233
 She's my friend, all right.
 I'm not gonna listen to this.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.302
I'm outta here.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.640
   <i>* Look what you do to me</i>

16:47.674 --> 16:50.110
<i>* You got me burning up</i>

16:50.143 --> 16:53.413
 <i>* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

16:53.446 --> 16:55.949
  <i>* - Hey, hey.</i>
  <i>-( crowd cheers ) *</i>

16:59.419 --> 17:02.155
 Ladies, ladies,
 you guys are awesome.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.623
 Do that tonight,
 and we're on our way.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.358
 Yeah!
 Yeah!

17:06.393 --> 17:08.560
All right, Screech, when
the producer gets here,

17:08.595 --> 17:10.930
make sure he sits right
in front of the stage.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.866
  -Got it.
  -All right!

17:12.898 --> 17:15.502
   -Lisa,
   you'll bring the costumes.
   -I'll pick you up, okay?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.637
 Everyone, be here by 7:00.
 Jessie, we'll come together.

17:17.671 --> 17:20.040
  Okay,
  hands in a circle for luck.

17:25.078 --> 17:28.048
 One, two, three, Hot Sundae!

17:28.048 --> 17:31.117
 We'll be great!
 We'll be awesome!
 We'll knock 'em dead, right?

17:31.151 --> 17:33.053
 Right?
 Yeah!

17:34.154 --> 17:36.222
 ( knocking on door )

17:36.256 --> 17:38.291
 Zack: Jessie?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.229
Jessie?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.631
 Hey, wake up.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.500
  Come on,
  we've got to go to The Max.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.569
   Come on, Jessie.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.108
-Come on.
-Zack?

17:55.141 --> 17:59.245
   What time is it?
I have to take
   my geometry test.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.716
-You already took the test.
-I did?

18:02.749 --> 18:05.285
   Yeah. Yeah, it's 6:30.
   Come on, we've gotta go.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.521
 -Where are we going?
 -Where are we going?

18:08.555 --> 18:11.191
You're singing tonight.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.093
-Singing?
-Yeah.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.694
   -Tonight?
   -Come on.

18:14.728 --> 18:15.695
  Wait, what am I gonna wear?

18:15.729 --> 18:19.366
 Jessie, remember?
 Lisa's bringing your costume.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.268
  -Right. I gotta wash my hair.
  -No there's no time.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.038
No time.
There's never any time.

18:25.071 --> 18:28.675
 I don't have time to study.
 I'll never get into Stanford.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.311
   I'll let everyone down.
   I'm so confused.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.381
 Jessie, hey, just calm down.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.316
-It's okay.
-You're right.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.686
   Everything will be okay.
   I just need one of these.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.055
   Pills? You mean you
   really are taking drugs?

18:42.088 --> 18:43.490
-I need them.
-Jessie, give me those!

18:43.523 --> 18:46.226
I need them, Zack.
I have to sing.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.062
   -You can't sing tonight.
   -Yes, I can.

18:49.062 --> 18:53.600
   <i>* I'm so excited</i>
   <i>I'm so excited  *</i>

18:53.633 --> 18:56.403
   I'm so...

18:56.436 --> 18:58.471
  ... scared.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.307
Jessie, Jessie.

19:01.341 --> 19:05.345
   Jessie, don't be scared.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.281
Listen,
we'll get through this.

19:09.182 --> 19:12.152
 Hey, come on.

19:12.185 --> 19:16.556
   Remember that time when
   we snuck out to see <i>E.T.?</i>

19:16.589 --> 19:19.025
 And riding home on our bikes

19:19.059 --> 19:23.029
  it was so dark,
  and we were scared.

19:23.063 --> 19:25.165
   Come on.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.035
  <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
  <i>The Max presents...</i>

20:03.103 --> 20:05.171
Hi, how're you doing?
I am AC Slater.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.540
Look, maybe you should
come back another time.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.576
 One of the girls
 wasn't feeling well,

20:09.609 --> 20:11.811
 and it was hard to find
 a replacement on short notice.

20:11.845 --> 20:14.614
 So we had to replace
 her with that thing.

20:17.117 --> 20:18.818
 I'm sorry I let you guys down.

20:18.852 --> 20:20.453
 Forget that.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.622
The important thing
is that you get better.

20:22.655 --> 20:26.659
 It's my own fault.
 I'm always taking on too much.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.395
 Well, we didn't help.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.864
   Maybe we put too much
   pressure on you to sing.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.867
  Kelly, you didn't
  give me the pills.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.236
 I can't believe
 I couldn't stop taking them.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.140
  -May I come in?
  -Of course.

20:41.207 --> 20:43.276
 Here you go.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.844
  The flowers are beautiful.

20:44.878 --> 20:47.480
   I picked them
   from Zack's yard.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.351
 Just kidding.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.620
  I wasn't very nice to you.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.422
You never are.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.559
 That's what I like about you.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.529
  -Will you forgive me?
  -You got it, Mama.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.598
   ( clears throat )

21:06.800 --> 21:08.802
  I owe you an apology, too.

21:08.835 --> 21:12.806
   I mean, don't let this
   go to your head, Slater,

21:12.839 --> 21:16.509
 but you were right.
 I should have listened to you.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.545
 Thanks, man.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.580
 I'm the one who didn't listen.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.549
   I've got a real problem.

21:22.582 --> 21:26.553
   My mom's taking
   me to the doctor
   tomorrow for counseling.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.656
  I've got to learn that it's
  okay if I'm not
  the best at everything.

21:30.724 --> 21:33.426
 Hey, I already learned that.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.828
 When?

21:34.861 --> 21:38.965
  Every time I get
  a report card full of C's.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.276
