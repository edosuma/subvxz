Rivera: We can't video
conference with the ship.

00:13.173 --> 00:14.573
Pirates are broadcasting at Hi-Def.

00:14.675 --> 00:16.641
Can we trace the broadcast
back to its source?

00:16.743 --> 00:17.776
Unlikely, sir.

00:17.878 --> 00:19.210
They probably sent it out as a sky wave.

00:19.312 --> 00:20.812
It works like a HAM radio signal.

00:20.914 --> 00:22.280
She's right.

00:22.382 --> 00:23.548
Anyone with rabbit ears
could be picking up the signal.

00:23.650 --> 00:24.916
So we'll put out a statement

00:25.018 --> 00:26.584
before the other stations
start rebroadcasting it.

00:26.686 --> 00:28.218
You can get out in front of this.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.954
Woman: <i> 22...</i>

00:30.056 --> 00:31.755
Wait, there's someone missing.

Who?

00:32.925 --> 00:34.024
Mason.

00:34.126 --> 00:35.893
Alisha: Maybe he got out somehow.

00:35.995 --> 00:38.963
Negative. Green and my brother swept
the club before they escaped.

00:39.065 --> 00:40.263
The pirates definitely took him.

00:40.365 --> 00:41.932
My God.

<i>So, Jeffrey Michener,
you will hear my demands.</i>

01:00.340 --> 01:03.274
<i>There are two U.S. Navy destroyers</i>

Based on the time

01:59.029 --> 02:00.962
and assuming they were transported

02:01.064 --> 02:03.264
by one of the three boats
we were tracking,

02:03.366 --> 02:06.667
this is our search area.

02:06.769 --> 02:08.368
It's also possible
the hostages were taken

02:08.470 --> 02:09.669
back to mainland China.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.504
Without any clue
to narrow down the search,

04:23.875 --> 04:25.007
When did this become a referendum

04:25.032 --> 04:26.165
on the President's honesty?

04:26.267 --> 04:27.433
There's nothing more he can say

04:27.535 --> 04:29.134
without compromising the mission.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.006
15 to 18 hours, sir.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.408
Well, that gives 'em plenty of time

04:36.510 --> 04:38.077
to join in on the hunt for the hostages.

04:38.179 --> 04:39.411
And not enough time to turn back

the hostages before

04:41.281 --> 04:42.513

04:42.615 --> 04:44.415
You'd counsel the President to give in,

04:44.517 --> 04:46.484
to turn these ships away from the fight?

04:46.586 --> 04:48.752
If it bought Chandler more time, yes.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.892
As your military advisor

you have no one to investigate

05:18.182 --> 05:20.116
big enough for
a band of pirates to hide out,

05:20.218 --> 05:21.817

05:21.919 --> 05:24.987
And there are hundreds of miles
between each one.

05:25.089 --> 05:26.722
If we make for it at full power,

05:26.824 --> 05:29.958
we'll hit the first island
in less than eight hours, sir.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.660
Alisha: We'll need to refuel first,

05:31.762 --> 05:33.728
otherwise we won't have enough
to search an area that size.

Pho Kong Island depot?

05:35.165 --> 05:35.997
Yes, sir.

05:36.099 --> 05:37.198
We refueled there on our way in,

05:37.300 --> 05:38.899

Easy. It's okay. It's okay.

05:49.645 --> 05:51.278
We got to give the James
a smaller target.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.480
Even if our trick
with the coordinates worked,

05:53.582 --> 05:55.616

06:03.592 --> 06:04.658
Even if I can create some static,

06:04.760 --> 06:06.725
the noise should
give the James a bearing.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.461
If they're in range of the broadcast,

06:08.563 --> 06:10.229

Well, even if we got to Japan,
we'd have no backup,

exactly what he wants.

08:32.375 --> 08:33.941
All of our ships are out of the region.

of finding them.

Oh, I'm not saying
that he doesn't want us dead,

08:42.183 --> 08:44.385
but Peng and the pirates
make strange bedfellows.

08:44.486 --> 08:46.119
Maybe they have different agendas.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.620
Didn't Peng call the President

08:47.722 --> 08:49.923
to pledge his full support
in rescuing our crew?

08:50.025 --> 08:53.192
Why don't we ask POTUS
to demand he clear the blockage?

08:53.295 --> 08:54.994
Force his hand
and then see where he stands.

08:55.096 --> 08:57.297
And then Peng says yes
and then during the refueling,

08:57.399 --> 08:59.432
the James accidentally goes up in flames

08:59.534 --> 09:01.000
and he pins it on the pirates again.

09:01.102 --> 09:02.522
Agreed.

09:06.740 --> 09:09.252
The President shouldn't ask
Peng for the fuel.

09:10.010 --> 09:10.842
We should.

09:11.208 --> 09:12.345
We call him ourselves?

09:12.446 --> 09:15.314
No, that'll just give
his warships our location.

a lot to discuss.

09:50.182 --> 09:51.915
We can own the cameras and doors.

09:52.017 --> 09:53.149
That'll get us inside.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.950
CIC can keep eyes on you from the sky.

in the middle of the night...

<i>Mrs. Miller, Jacob Barnes, AMT News.</i>

28:18.708 --> 28:20.341
<i>Have you seen the gruesome video?</i>

28:20.443 --> 28:22.143
<i>- Just leave me alone.
-Were you aware that your son</i>

28:22.245 --> 28:23.744
<i>was among the captives before
that footage came out?</i>

28:23.846 --> 28:25.079
<i>Please, I don't want
to talk about this now.</i>

28:25.181 --> 28:26.547
<i>The President said that he tried</i>

28:26.649 --> 28:28.349
<i>to reach out to all of the families.</i>

28:28.451 --> 28:31.469
<i>How long did it take
before the administration found you?</i>

28:31.571 --> 28:33.630
<i>I only found out this morning.</i>

28:33.731 --> 28:36.414
<i>Eric was one of the original</i>
<i>crew members on</i> Nathan James.

28:36.517 --> 28:38.886
<i>Do you feel that the President is doing
enough to save him?</i>

28:38.988 --> 28:40.093
<i>I don't know what he's doing.</i>

28:40.195 --> 28:42.848
<i>My son, he fought
to bring home the cure.</i>

28:42.950 --> 28:44.245
<i>He helped save millions of lives.</i>

28:44.270 --> 28:46.069
<i>He even saved the President's life.</i>

28:46.171 --> 28:48.538
<i>Shame on you, Jeffrey Michener.</i>

28:48.641 --> 28:51.508
<i>Shame on you if you don't
bring my boy home.</i>

28:53.845 --> 28:55.344
<i>A heartsick mother</i>

28:55.446 --> 28:57.613
<i>and a bitter indictment
of this administration.</i>

28:58.244 --> 29:00.249
<i>And with no end in sight
to this hostage crisis,</i>

29:00.351 --> 29:01.684
<i>one question remains...</i>

29:01.786 --> 29:03.689
<i>what is the President's next move?</i>

29:04.221 --> 29:05.588
<i>Jacob Barnes, AMT News, St. Louis.</i>

29:05.690 --> 29:07.256
Damn it, Jacob.

29:07.952 --> 29:10.660
Man: Shore up position
for the hose off deck.

29:16.032 --> 29:17.532
Fuel's clean, sir.

29:22.071 --> 29:24.272
Begin refueling.

29:33.518 --> 29:34.517
Find anything?

29:34.619 --> 29:36.180
Nothing that connects him to Takehaya.

29:36.282 --> 29:37.607
Takehaya?

29:40.103 --> 29:42.237
You think I am working with him?

29:42.339 --> 29:43.638
Not much of a stretch.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.340
My plane goes down

29:45.442 --> 29:48.108
same time my friends are kidnapped
thousands of miles away.

29:48.211 --> 29:51.247
There's coincidence,
and there's conspiracy.

29:51.577 --> 29:53.848
You want us to stop rummaging
through your things,

29:54.370 --> 29:55.850
maybe it's time for some answers.

29:55.952 --> 29:57.353
Wolf: Sasha.

30:07.552 --> 30:08.685
What do you make of this?

30:08.787 --> 30:10.553
Map of the Paracels.

30:10.655 --> 30:12.425
All these islands checked off

30:12.925 --> 30:14.324
like you were searching for something.

30:14.426 --> 30:16.693
As I have told you, Captain,

30:16.795 --> 30:18.628
before you came to China,

30:18.731 --> 30:21.130
the pirates were my biggest problem,

30:21.232 --> 30:22.464
threatening my ships,

30:22.566 --> 30:25.400
taking what did not belong to them.

30:25.502 --> 30:28.965
Takehaya is the worst of the worst.

30:29.925 --> 30:31.673
So you're hunting him.

30:35.533 --> 30:37.678
And you don't know where he is.

30:38.078 --> 30:42.050
If I did, I would've already
kill him myself.

30:42.662 --> 30:43.784
Maybe.

30:43.887 --> 30:45.386
But there's still the small matter...

30:45.488 --> 30:49.490
[Camera shutter clicks]
...of a very big coincidence.

30:51.061 --> 30:53.861
- [Radio clicks]
- Danny: Bogey approaching.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.040
_

31:52.218 --> 31:56.353
I suggest we wrap things up.
He will be back.

32:06.679 --> 32:08.846
Michener: Gentlemen, Mrs. Price.

32:09.478 --> 32:11.241
We were all seated around the table here

32:11.341 --> 32:12.440
just 4 1/2 months ago

32:12.542 --> 32:14.430
forming a new national government.

32:14.947 --> 32:16.077
Representing your regions,

32:16.179 --> 32:17.512
you helped bring people together,

32:17.614 --> 32:18.546
one nation under God.

32:20.125 --> 32:20.714
I'm calling you now

32:20.816 --> 32:22.850
to ask for that support again.

32:22.951 --> 32:24.551
Sir, I don't know how they're reacting

32:24.653 --> 32:27.120
to this hostage situation in St. Louis,

32:27.222 --> 32:28.321
but I can tell you

32:28.424 --> 32:29.656
it's not playing well
here in the Southwest.

32:29.759 --> 32:30.924
People are outraged.

32:31.026 --> 32:32.593
I understand, and I'm acting

32:32.695 --> 32:34.695
as swiftly and as smartly as possible.

32:34.797 --> 32:38.698
This situation is fluid,
to say the least.

32:39.608 --> 32:42.802
But we're hoping that Captain Chandler

32:42.904 --> 32:44.937
can give us some answers
before the deadline.

32:45.760 --> 32:48.939
What I really need from everyone
right now is time...

32:49.041 --> 32:52.278
time to assess the dynamic
situation across the world,

32:52.380 --> 32:54.946
time for Captain Chandler
to do what he does.

32:55.048 --> 32:58.559
He got us this far.
We owe him that much.

32:59.430 --> 33:02.254
Mr. President, the next few hours

33:02.355 --> 33:05.624
will determine the future,
for better or worse.

33:06.198 --> 33:08.280
But you have my support.

33:09.095 --> 33:10.711
Croft: Mine, too, Mr. President.

33:12.165 --> 33:15.900
Jeffrey, you know I don't agree
with your recent policy moves,

33:16.001 --> 33:19.202
the rations, the property laws and such,

33:19.305 --> 33:20.471
and I can safely say

33:20.573 --> 33:23.140
that the good survivors
of TexArkana will not abide

33:23.242 --> 33:25.876
a strong, central government
coming out of Missouri

33:25.978 --> 33:28.678
if they don't have confidence
in a non-elected President.

33:29.291 --> 33:31.361
But on this, we are united.

33:31.616 --> 33:34.517
I will do my best to keep
the pitchforks at bay.

33:34.966 --> 33:37.353
Bring home our people.

33:38.824 --> 33:42.124
Thank you. All of you.

[Birds chirping]

34:44.036 --> 34:45.603
Peng: The clock is ticking.

34:45.853 --> 34:49.121
You have only eight hours
before Takehaya's deadline.

34:49.223 --> 34:51.255
And he will certainly keep his word

34:51.358 --> 34:53.925
and start executing hostages.

34:54.027 --> 34:57.128
We'll leave,
but not until I get the truth

34:57.230 --> 34:59.030
about why you tried to kill me.

34:59.132 --> 35:02.567
You came to my home, then you insult me,

35:02.669 --> 35:04.903
accuse me of atrocities

35:05.005 --> 35:07.104
in front of all the other delegates.

35:07.589 --> 35:08.733
No.

35:10.543 --> 35:11.575
That's not it.

35:13.579 --> 35:17.313
Maybe I needed your help
to fight the pirates.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.883
Your country would never send support.

35:19.985 --> 35:21.418
I could force their hand

35:21.520 --> 35:24.354
by framing Takehaya for your deaths.

35:25.246 --> 35:29.593
Or maybe I wanted to draw
your country into a war,

35:29.694 --> 35:32.161
take out its best leader.

35:33.257 --> 35:36.032
Or maybe it was personal.

35:45.108 --> 35:47.275
You want the truth?

35:47.377 --> 35:52.080
The truth is... I wanted you dead.

35:52.182 --> 35:54.916
At this point in our world history,

35:55.018 --> 35:56.565
isn't that reason enough?

35:57.988 --> 36:00.048
The most important

36:00.891 --> 36:04.909
is that we now have
a common enemy in Takehaya,

36:05.728 --> 36:07.667
and you are running out of time.

36:24.913 --> 36:26.045
Burk: Refuel complete, sir.

36:26.147 --> 36:28.180
Roger that. We're on our way home.

36:28.991 --> 36:30.382
Alpha, you got six tangos

36:30.485 --> 36:32.218
coming your way from the north end.

36:34.522 --> 36:35.608
Green?

36:39.230 --> 36:41.093
Danny: Hall is clear.

36:41.194 --> 36:42.393
They got our north exfil covered.

36:42.496 --> 36:43.629
We'll take the south side.

36:43.731 --> 36:44.592
Kill the cameras.

Go. Kill Takehaya.

38:34.068 --> 38:35.466
I'll see you again.

I look forward to it.

39:03.462 --> 39:05.162
Fuel's at full capacity, sir.

39:05.264 --> 39:08.098
We even found a warehouse
filled with canned goods,

39:08.200 --> 39:10.499
sodas, snacks, kind of like
a regular gas station.

39:10.601 --> 39:12.268
Hope you picked up some lottery tickets.

39:12.370 --> 39:13.569

39:13.671 --> 39:15.138
Sasha: Here's our original search area.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.340
Lieutenant Burke, can we overlay
Peng's map with our own?

39:19.410 --> 39:21.988
Suddenly our search area just
got a hell of a lot smaller.

39:22.713 --> 39:24.947
We can rule out all these islands.

39:26.328 --> 39:28.950
Chandler: Leaving
just those five to search.

39:29.052 --> 39:29.951
Outstanding.

39:30.053 --> 39:31.719
Sir, I recommend we search east to west.

39:31.822 --> 39:33.779
That'll put the morning sun behind us.

39:33.882 --> 39:35.627
Very well.
Set a course, all ahead, full.

39:35.729 --> 39:36.500
Aye, sir.

Very clever.
