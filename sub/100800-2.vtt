WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:08.968
I am going to make Vida into the spot
of what's happening

00:09.009 --> 00:10.553
in Latinx culture.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.346
Maybe the vigilantes
will get off your back

00:12.388 --> 00:14.682
if you support some local groups
or some orgs.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.809
Don't forget to take apá
to his blood transfusion appointment.

00:16.851 --> 00:17.852
Yeah, I'll take him.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.353
Mon Chou Chou.

00:19.395 --> 00:21.188
Excuse me, barback.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.606
It's not as suspect as it looks.

00:22.648 --> 00:23.733
I trust you.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.068
I didn't put together
that we'd lose this mural.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.946
Emma told me
that I ain't got no right to be there.

00:28.988 --> 00:31.323
Just know I seen him with my own eyes.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.175
I, like, halfway believe you.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.301
- Good.
- What?

02:15.386 --> 02:16.637
'Cause I'm not lying.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.809
What are we doing tomorrow?

02:23.102 --> 02:24.103
We?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.023
I, myself, have no plans.

02:28.858 --> 02:30.025
Okay.

02:31.402 --> 02:35.155
Well, do you want to ride with me

02:35.197 --> 02:36.574
up to Big Bear?

02:36.615 --> 02:38.409
My lungs need to breathe

02:38.450 --> 02:41.829
something other than this shit L.A. air.

02:43.289 --> 02:44.665
We can go camping.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.044
We can go hiking.

02:49.879 --> 02:52.590
Like, outdoors?

02:52.631 --> 02:55.217
I'd rather have lunch with a MAGA.

02:55.259 --> 02:58.762
Okay, Miss Big City Girl From Chicago.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.849
Listen, I lived in south Texas
with my grandmother

03:01.891 --> 03:03.809
on what was basically a ranch.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.811
I'm no stranger to bugs and critters.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.062
Okay. Well, great.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.481
Then it should be fun.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.073
We can make s'mores.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.953
Become one with Mother Nature.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.415
How's that sound?

03:30.419 --> 03:32.087
You're very convincing.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.260
Oh, God, yes.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.312
Oh, God.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.522
Emma?

03:52.524 --> 03:56.278
I think we should go
and try and meet this guy.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.074
You know, just to make sure
he's not our actual father.

04:00.115 --> 04:03.327
- Seriously, Lyn?
- Yes, seriously!

04:03.369 --> 04:06.914
Emma, aren't you curious
to see if he's really papi?

04:06.956 --> 04:09.249
I'm so curious.
I can't think about anything else.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.293
Do you think we can pick this up
another time,

04:11.335 --> 04:13.337
when I'm not otherwise occupied?

04:13.379 --> 04:16.298
And if it is him, do you think he knows
mami told us he was dead?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.301
Lyn.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.552
What?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.057
You know what's so enraging
is that Eddy thought up

04:25.099 --> 04:28.394
this whole little scenario as a "fuck you"

04:28.435 --> 04:30.854
because she thought at least one of us
would fall for it.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.483
I don't understand how you can be
so sure that Eddy's lying.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.736
Frankly, Eddy is just not that creative.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.072
Now, mami, she was the queen of lies,
and you know it.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.825
Lyn, none of this is real.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.285
Let's not put any more energy
into it, okay?

04:45.327 --> 04:46.578
But what if it is?

04:47.246 --> 04:50.374
You saw INS drag papi out of here.

04:50.416 --> 04:54.378
Yeah, but no one saw him die

04:54.420 --> 04:56.296
trying to cross back.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.090
Vida and everyone else in our lives,

04:58.132 --> 05:00.384
they'd all have to be in on it, then.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.594
Don't open up this can of worms.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.931
It'll only end in disappointment.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.182
Please.

05:12.062 --> 05:16.358
Lyn, Ilana wants a dedicated table
to put their info on tonight.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.818
Can you set it up by the gate?

05:18.402 --> 05:19.737
Who's Ilana?

05:19.778 --> 05:21.405
East L.A. Neighborhood Advocates.

05:21.447 --> 05:22.906
They're the nonprofit

05:22.948 --> 05:25.743
that I settled on to benefit
from tonight's food stand thing.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.286
God, I really hope this helps
to shut them up.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.454
Yeah.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.373
I'm really getting tired of them yelling
"Coconut Barbie" at me.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.833
Like, change it up already.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.420
- Yes, I'll set up one by the front.
- Thank you.

05:36.462 --> 05:39.715
Oh, and I am calling tonight

05:39.757 --> 05:42.384
"Stands and Delivered."

05:42.426 --> 05:43.427
Get it?

05:46.096 --> 05:47.097
Stand...

05:48.015 --> 05:49.767
Like the movie.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.436
Edward James Olmos and everyone's favorite

05:52.478 --> 05:54.855
non-Mexican Mexican, Lou Diamond Philips.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.025
Stand and Deliver. That's clever.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.568
Yeah, I know.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.611
Okay.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.825
Sorry about that whole thing.

06:07.785 --> 06:09.870
She's so obsessed with this.

06:09.912 --> 06:13.707
Do you really think Eddy would lie
just to hurt the two of you?

06:13.749 --> 06:14.750
I do.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.293
Really?

06:18.087 --> 06:20.464
I really didn't figure her the type.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.008
Eddy's not malicious, but I think
she's in a dark place right now

06:23.050 --> 06:24.676
and mad at me for...

06:27.930 --> 06:31.809
Well, I did sort of drive her away
with the whole mural thing.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.478
Yeah.

06:37.231 --> 06:40.067
I just don't want Lyn
to get hurt, you know?

06:41.110 --> 06:43.695
I think Eddy might just be confused.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.905
Maybe.

06:48.826 --> 06:53.664
What's confusing is how a person manages
to put their entire life

06:53.705 --> 06:55.916
into one surplus duffel bag.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.295
So rugged.

07:01.296 --> 07:05.300
That bag's been with me to 17 countries
and one tour of Iraq.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.719
Nomads don't need much.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.306
I hate that she did this to you.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.476
Yeah, well, sometimes you have to pay
the price to get your shit back.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.229
- But fucking domestic abuse?
- All right, SVU.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.190
It's not domestic abuse. Zoe threw keys.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.068
Fucking psycho.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.736
Well, at least I got my bike back.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.243
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.037
Hey, this Luis dude keeps calling
asking about his truck.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.415
Cómo chinga ese cabrón.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.251
He's been blowing up my phone, too.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.086
What's with you?

07:41.920 --> 07:44.173
I haven't slept all night.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.259
The baby gave us a big scare.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.928
We had to rush her to the ER.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.972
What? What happened?

07:53.348 --> 07:54.349
She was...

07:55.350 --> 07:57.102
She was breathing all funny
and had a fever,

07:57.144 --> 07:58.979
so Karla freaked out and just...

08:00.147 --> 08:01.565
I'm not gonna lie. I did, too.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.734
Well, what was it? Is she okay?

08:03.775 --> 08:07.321
Yeah, no, she's fine now,
but we were in the hospital all night.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.031
They're still there.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.699
Well, then what are you doing here?

08:10.741 --> 08:14.369
Pues, I came to finish this cabrón's truck
so he can leave me alone.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.787
That way, he can pay me already.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.208
I don't need Karla stressing
about money, too, you know?

08:19.249 --> 08:21.376
Yeah. Damn, poor Elenita.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.670
Oh, I know. My baby girl.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.133
They were poking her
and just prodding her and just...

08:28.175 --> 08:29.468
Oh, man.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.595
All right, I'm gonna get started
on this real quick

08:31.637 --> 08:33.180
so I can go back to pick them up.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.643
Oh, hey, how did
apá's appointment go yesterday?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.019
Oh, shit.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.437
Johnny.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.940
Mari, it slipped my mind
with la baby y todo eso.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.692
I promise, I'll set another appointment
sometime this week, all right?

08:45.734 --> 08:47.736
You can't just reschedule
his appointments.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.906
This is for his toxin levels.
They build up in his blood.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.783
It's not just a checkup, Johnny.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.244
He needs to have his transfusion
when he's scheduled to have it.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.995
I'm sorry, all right? I...

08:57.037 --> 08:58.997
I can take him tomorrow for sure.
I just...

08:59.039 --> 09:00.624
Apá will be fine for one day.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.167
I don't know
if he should wait another day.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.877
Well, then you take him.
Shit, I don't know.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.796
You know that I can't show up there.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.965
Then he's gonna have to wait
till tomorrow. I'm sorry.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.237
Apá, soy yo.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.490
Johnny se le olvidó el appointment.

09:33.532 --> 09:37.661
So I'm here porque we have to try to see
if we could get you in.

09:45.377 --> 09:50.257
Apá, you don't have to talk to me,
but I have to take you to the doctor.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.100
I'm coming in, okay?

10:05.397 --> 10:06.398
Apá?

10:10.277 --> 10:11.278
Apá?

10:17.909 --> 10:18.910
Apá?

10:22.664 --> 10:23.957
Apá.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.001
Apá.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.669
Apá!

10:27.711 --> 10:30.380
No, no, no.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.716
Apá! Apá!

10:34.217 --> 10:35.385
Apá.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.555
Oh, my God.

10:38.597 --> 10:39.931
No. No.

10:46.063 --> 10:49.149
Lucha libre is iconic,
but "the dominants,"

10:49.191 --> 10:50.942
'cause I'm refusing to say "white"
these days,

10:50.984 --> 10:52.527
they've taken it away from us, too.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.695
The caucasity!

10:53.737 --> 10:55.405
We got to reclaim that shit.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.907
- So what do you think?
- Mami, you need help?

10:56.948 --> 10:58.200
About what? Thank you, Curly, yeah.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.702
About a lucha libre night
but, like, cheeky.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.455
Como que más homoerotic.

11:03.497 --> 11:08.293
Lo podemos hacer,
like, lucha libre burlesque.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.128
You can have signature drinks
like Mil Máscaras mule

11:10.170 --> 11:11.588
or El Santo sidecar.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.050
A blue drink that's just El Blue Demon.

11:15.092 --> 11:18.512
Okay, but, like, where would we do
the actual lucha libre part, though?

11:18.553 --> 11:21.139
Like, on the stage.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.557
We can make it into a ring.

11:22.599 --> 11:26.436
We can make it
into sexy lucha libre mud wrestling.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.063
What? No.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.481
Nothing tacky.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.274
Not that your masks are tacky.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.943
I didn't mean that, Curly. It's just...

11:32.984 --> 11:34.319
Oh, I know.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.572
I have this whole idea about what I want
for Vida, and it's not that.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.659
For the non-music stuff, I want people
to get an experience they can't get

11:40.700 --> 11:42.953
anywhere else in L.A.
but, like, not ratch.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.790
Oh, that sounds like prissy Miss Emma
talking right there.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.583
Actually, I think
she would be fine with it

11:48.625 --> 11:50.335
if I suggested we should do it.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.296
She's actually been fine
with everything I've said lately,

11:53.338 --> 11:54.381
which is weird.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.633
Well, not everything.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.009
What?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.594
These tables are all wrong.

11:59.636 --> 12:00.929
Let's put them longways.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.514
Comadrita, what's wrong?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.099
These freaking tables are all wrong!

12:04.141 --> 12:06.643
No, a la verga con las tables.
Something's happening with you.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.311
Ay, perra, so pushy!

12:09.020 --> 12:10.605
Is Emma giving you a hard time?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.482
Because she should be out here
helping you out right now.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.525
No!

12:15.235 --> 12:19.072
It's this whole thing with Eddy's letter.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.407
About your newfound dad?

12:21.324 --> 12:26.288
About my possibly very unlikely
newfound dad, yes.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.415
We're just not seeing eye to eye on it.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.751
Emma's convinced it's all lies and...

12:33.795 --> 12:35.547
...says I should leave it alone.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.048
I've heard of crazier things.

12:37.841 --> 12:42.053
Ay, girl, these "menses"
teniendo familia por todos lados.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.810
You owe it to yourself
to at least look into it.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.819
And you'll let me know, or I just come by?

12:57.861 --> 13:01.823
Yeah, the body will be released
in a few days, but you should call first.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.284
- Sorry for your loss.
- All right, thank you.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.415
They just took him.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.679
In a few days...

13:26.014 --> 13:29.267
...I'm gonna need to go sign some papers
at the morgue so they can release him.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.356
We're gonna have to decide
if we're gonna bury him

13:34.397 --> 13:36.149
or cremate him or, you know?

13:41.279 --> 13:44.324
If you had just taken apá
to his transfusion, Johnny...

13:44.366 --> 13:46.368
If you had just done that one thing.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.006
I have to call the family.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.134
And you know
what's gonna happen, right, Mari?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.304
All of them are gonna show up
with their platters,

14:06.346 --> 14:07.931
trying to feed us and be all...

14:09.641 --> 14:11.309
They're gonna ask their questions.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.271
They're gonna want to know
the funeral arrangements.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.731
- You know he didn't make no arrangements.
- Yeah, I know.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.317
So we're gonna have to figure it out.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.371
Hey, Mari.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.916
You know,
maybe you shouldn't do the whole,

14:34.958 --> 14:36.751
you know, blue lipstick thing.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.964
You know how tía Magda gets, toda judgy.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.604
Eddy!

15:02.235 --> 15:04.404
Your Subaru...

15:11.494 --> 15:12.495
Got it.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.376
Thanks for letting us kidnap your car.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.919
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.254
What's going on?

15:21.296 --> 15:23.006
You turning the bar into a restaurant now?

15:23.048 --> 15:25.425
Oh, no. That's just for tonight.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.844
Trying to raise money
to get some bullies off our back.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.554
By the way, we're being protested.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.681
Yeah, I heard something about that.

15:31.723 --> 15:32.724
Yeah.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.102
You sure you don't want to come in?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.520
We got Flamin' Hot corn dogs.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.939
Emma made it bien clear
what she thinks about me.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.984
She called me a freeloader,
said that I'm a mentirosa,

15:43.026 --> 15:45.195
that I was only just trying to hurt you.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.946
You know I don't think that, Eddy.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.283
Your amá died married to that guy.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.243
That's why she couldn't legally marry me.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.039
I don't know what to think.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.584
Yeah. Here's what you asked me for.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.838
It's everything Rocky's cousin
dug up on your apá.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.716
She's not just a metiche.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.093
She's a lawyer.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.641
If this is true
and mami kept papi from us...

16:20.271 --> 16:21.606
Really?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.068
Looks like you got company.

16:26.236 --> 16:29.989
Anyways, I'm gonna go pay
my respects to Johnny and Mari.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.367
What? Why pay your respects?

16:35.537 --> 16:37.997
Mr. Sanchez passed away today.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.333
What? What? How?

16:40.375 --> 16:43.378
I don't know all the details.
I just found out.

16:43.420 --> 16:46.256
I'm going over there con unas enchiladas.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.674
Sorry, Lyn.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.105
Yeah, it shouldn't fall down again.

17:03.481 --> 17:04.941
You get the first one.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.026
Oh, wow. Thank you.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.361
- Enjoy.
- Yeah.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.697
Be right back.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.702
How's she doing?

17:15.744 --> 17:17.162
Oh, she's solid.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.581
She used to sling drinks at Good Luck Bar
before it closed.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.708
We'll try her out, see what you think.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.002
What the hell is that?

17:24.043 --> 17:26.921
It's a unicorn concha ice cream sandwich.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.131
What does it look like?

17:28.923 --> 17:31.926
Never took you for the type
to eat a concha in public.

17:32.927 --> 17:37.140
Well, only one time,
in college at a party.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.444
Okay.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.322
I have to go man your bar.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.656
You go do that.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.996
- Hey.
- Mr. Sanchez died.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.372
Johnny and Mari's dad.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.584
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.796
I should go pay my respects.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.381
But I should bring flowers, right?

18:11.174 --> 18:13.343
Maybe send flowers.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.511
No!

18:14.552 --> 18:17.138
That's, like, so cold and impersonal.

18:18.181 --> 18:22.393
Oh, I also gave Eddy back her Subaru.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.645
What?

18:23.686 --> 18:25.355
Emma, it was about time.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.232
It's her car. We can't just keep it.

18:28.858 --> 18:32.654
Oh, and also, I talked to her about papi

18:32.695 --> 18:34.572
or that man named Victor.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.032
Lyn, I...

18:36.074 --> 18:37.075
Look, Emma.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.203
Here's a marriage certificate...

18:41.454 --> 18:43.414
...program from his church.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.584
I hate how you manufacture drama.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.961
Look around.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.797
You're making things happen.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.216
Don't get distracted by bullshit.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.635
I'm not.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.849
It also might not be bullshit, but okay.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.489
Amor, hola.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.744
Ay, con ese lipstick
tan escándaloso, Marisol.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.829
Qué falta de respeto.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.499
Ay, mi'ja, que Dios te bendiga.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.710
Look, can you make
a little bit more mix, please?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.504
I can stay right here if you want.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.507
Sounds like we got
our own chorus out there.

20:57.548 --> 21:01.552
Well, thank God the DJ
is gonna drown them out.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.180
It's still a very good turnout, though.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.640
Oh, you're blowing up, man.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.141
- Yeah.
- Mon Chou Chou.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.645
- Oh, no.
- Fuck me.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.480
This bitch is not coming up here
to disturb the peace.

21:12.522 --> 21:16.067
No, you're not coming into my bar
to do your Zoe drama.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.361
I didn't come here
to cause you any trouble, Emma.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.154
Zoe, I'm gonna walk you to your car.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.323
You unbelievable asshole.

21:22.365 --> 21:26.119
You just get tired of your little projects
and move on to the next, right?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.620
But you're still gonna keep using me?

21:27.662 --> 21:29.288
What fucking projects?

21:29.330 --> 21:30.331
We've been...

21:30.373 --> 21:32.917
Shit, you have been done with me
for months.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.544
Why are you refrying this dead thing?

21:34.585 --> 21:37.213
I'm serious.
Take your dyke drama somewhere else.

21:37.255 --> 21:38.965
Oh, this is a dead thing, Nico?

21:39.590 --> 21:41.342
Don't start with that.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.052
Emma, it was brought to my attention

21:43.094 --> 21:45.138
when I had my little chat here
with Nicole...

21:45.179 --> 21:46.264
You mean when you attacked her.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.808
What? I didn't attack her.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.688
Listen, a lot happened that night,

21:53.730 --> 21:55.815
but one of the things
I realized is that Nico

21:55.857 --> 21:58.568
- hasn't been completely honest with you.
- Zoe, come on.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.111
Which is so seriously unlike her.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.363
Usually when she's had
her little dalliances,

22:02.405 --> 22:04.407
she's been completely honest with them,

22:04.449 --> 22:08.619
but she failed to tell you
that we're still married.

22:09.579 --> 22:11.205
For fuck's sake, Zoe.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.791
You just had to, didn't you?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.588
Emma, this is just something
she likes to hold over my head.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.214
It's not real.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.593
We're technically married, yes,

22:23.634 --> 22:25.553
but it was for the insurance.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.472
It's nothing more.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.557
It didn't start out as nothing, Nico.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.643
Zoe, come on! This isn't gonna work.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.897
Whatever you're trying
to make happen, it's not.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.023
No.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.400
But she needed to know.

22:39.442 --> 22:43.279
If I ever see you near my bar again,
I'll call the cops.

22:43.821 --> 22:44.822
I mean it.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.994
Make sure she leaves.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.458
Zoe, come on.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.129
Johnny's dad died.

24:24.338 --> 24:25.339
I know.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.342
Pobre hombre, died alone.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.345
That's so terrible.

24:33.306 --> 24:36.767
Now they're orphans,
just like Emma and me.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.979
Que en paz descanse.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.193
Hey.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.821
Are we orphans?

24:52.450 --> 24:54.368
You know everything,

24:54.410 --> 24:56.787
and not because you say you talk to ghosts

24:56.829 --> 24:59.373
but because you're always in the chisme.

25:02.335 --> 25:05.588
Is that man my papi?

25:09.217 --> 25:11.177
Is he really alive?

25:24.607 --> 25:26.734
Emma, you have to hear this.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.028
Doña Lupe, please tell Emma
what you just told me.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.238
Lyn, please, just...

25:30.279 --> 25:32.031
Emma, you're going to listen.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.576
Ándele, doña Lupe. Say it.

25:36.827 --> 25:39.830
Your papá is alive. Es verdad.

25:41.332 --> 25:45.002
And, yes, he's a pastor
y vive en Lincoln Heights.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.045
See, Emma?

25:46.629 --> 25:50.216
Proof that mami fucking lied.

25:50.967 --> 25:54.053
All this time, she fucking lied to us.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.846
What else is new?

25:55.888 --> 25:57.807
Our entire lives have been a lie.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.850
How can you be so "whatever" about this?

26:00.393 --> 26:01.852
What do you want me to do?

26:02.645 --> 26:05.773
To get upset
because people have betrayed me,

26:05.815 --> 26:09.235
have betrayed us our entire lives?

26:10.236 --> 26:12.154
If you're saying this man was living

26:12.196 --> 26:16.826
just a few miles away from us
and never looked for us...

26:18.411 --> 26:20.538
...why would I want to know this person?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.665
Because he's the only family we have.

26:22.707 --> 26:25.543
We are the only family we have.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.421
And I'm not gonna let some deadbeat

26:28.462 --> 26:30.798
that didn't want shit to do with us
back in our lives

26:30.840 --> 26:34.051
in any way, shape, or form,
and neither are you, Lyn.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.678
- No, how can you...
- Just listen!

26:35.720 --> 26:37.346
Look, just... Enough.

26:45.313 --> 26:49.525
Mi'ja, there's a reason
your mami did what she did.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.695
We could be getting a second chance
at having a father.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.325
This doesn't just happen.

27:14.508 --> 27:15.509
Hey.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.473
I know you don't like to have
these little talks while you're working,

27:20.514 --> 27:21.932
so I won't do that to you, but...

27:23.392 --> 27:26.479
It will all make sense
when I explain it to you, Emma.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.939
I mean, I was always gonna tell you.
I just haven't had a chance yet.

27:29.899 --> 27:33.361
But this wasn't me going
behind your back in any way.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.488
No, but it's still a lie.

27:35.529 --> 27:36.947
Wait, hold up. I...

27:38.324 --> 27:41.577
I didn't tell you right away
because I never think about it, Emma.

27:42.203 --> 27:44.372
Zoe and I have been done.

27:44.413 --> 27:47.666
When she left me, went off with some girl
to make her documentary,

27:47.708 --> 27:49.960
and she convinced me
to stay on the insurance.

27:50.544 --> 27:54.465
And I accepted
because I'm a fucking freelancer,

27:54.507 --> 27:56.884
and I take meds that I can't afford
on what I make.

27:57.927 --> 28:02.056
Emma, I have no idea
why she came back to start all of this.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.977
God, it's easy to get caught
in that magic you create, Nico...

28:07.978 --> 28:09.688
...that bullshit you've perfected.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.358
Whoa, none of this was a lie, Emma.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.444
I mean, except this technicality.

28:15.486 --> 28:17.571
It was a nice few days...

28:18.739 --> 28:21.200
...fun little moment of weakness for me...

28:22.451 --> 28:23.994
...but it won't happen again.

28:33.504 --> 28:36.215
- Cuídate, mi'jo.
- Ahí le aviso. Gracias.

28:36.257 --> 28:38.676
And remember to get el padre Jose,

28:38.717 --> 28:41.262
because the misa has to be in Spanish.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.972
Sí, tía.

28:43.013 --> 28:46.642
Ay, este es el plato que compramos

28:46.684 --> 28:49.603
cuando vino el Papa Juan Pablo.

28:51.147 --> 28:53.816
He was the last good pope.

28:57.695 --> 29:00.489
The casket les va a salir carito, ¿eh?

29:00.531 --> 29:02.825
You might have to get on a payment plan.

29:04.618 --> 29:08.289
Is this the one that Mama Chana crocheted?

29:10.499 --> 29:14.962
Ay, pero está toda frayed.

29:15.004 --> 29:17.256
You let it get all frayed.

29:17.298 --> 29:19.383
I'm going to have to fix it.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.761
Bueno, ya me voy.

29:22.803 --> 29:23.888
Adiós.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.309
- Tía.
- Huh?

29:28.350 --> 29:29.351
Listen...

29:30.269 --> 29:34.356
Do you think you and tío Raúl would be
able to help us out with the casket?

29:34.398 --> 29:37.443
Well, the funeral expenses in general.

29:37.485 --> 29:38.861
We could use some help.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.866
I'm sure
that you can figure it out, mi'jo.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.535
Bueno, ya los dejo, ¿eh?

29:47.453 --> 29:51.665
Ay, este me encanta...

29:57.254 --> 29:59.381
Yo, did tía Magda just jack us?

29:59.423 --> 30:01.300
You know how she is.

30:01.342 --> 30:02.760
Why did you ask her for money?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.261
I don't want to ask anyone for anything.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.722
You know how much they said
the casket's gonna cost?

30:06.764 --> 30:08.891
Do you? 8K.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.603
8K. Where the hell am I gonna
get that kind of money?

30:13.979 --> 30:16.315
And that's just for the casket.
That's not the funeral.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.739
Ay, apá.

32:58.102 --> 33:00.270
Apá is never going to get to meet her.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.782
He's never going to get
to meet my baby girl.
