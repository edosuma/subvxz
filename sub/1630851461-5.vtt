WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.310
- Here inside a backyard tree,

00:06.354 --> 00:09.009
a squirrel embarks
on her journey into motherhood.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.663
This squirrel mother
will raise her young son

00:11.707 --> 00:14.318
without a male partner.

00:14.362 --> 00:17.582
She teaches him skills
of survival,

00:17.626 --> 00:19.062
then pushes him to accept

00:19.106 --> 00:21.195
a suitable mate
of <i>her</i> choosing...

00:23.893 --> 00:25.329
...and repeat the cycle.

00:33.468 --> 00:36.862
- But things don't always
go according to plan.

01:09.417 --> 01:10.896
Is that any good?

01:13.029 --> 01:14.204
- Saturday morning.

01:14.248 --> 01:15.205
Time to snoop through

01:15.249 --> 01:16.946
family's trash cans.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.949
Best way to really connect
with loved ones.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.779
Hm.
Annie still trying.

01:23.822 --> 01:24.997
Good girl.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.565
Okay, Trophy's.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.611
Trophy do better.
Huh.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.830
She eat a fruit.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.963
And last, Peter's.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.922
Boy too sensitive
to throw anything away.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.924
Wait.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.448
Toenail clippings.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.276
Is finally happened!

01:42.319 --> 01:45.148
My Peter is officially man!

01:47.063 --> 01:50.153
Yes, Dasha,
need woman with working uterus

01:50.197 --> 01:52.155
whose spirit is already broken.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.939
This afternoon perfect!

01:53.983 --> 01:55.637
Okay.
Bye-bye!

01:55.680 --> 01:59.597
Peter! I thought
the day would never come.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.121
Then, today I find out

02:01.164 --> 02:03.471
you finally ready for marriage!

02:03.514 --> 02:07.170
- Huh? But you always say
I'm not boyfriend material.

02:07.214 --> 02:10.434
- In old country, at first sign
of a man's independence,

02:10.478 --> 02:11.827
he must marry.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.133
This either happens

02:13.176 --> 02:14.873
when he order his own meal

02:14.917 --> 02:16.136
in drive-through...

02:16.179 --> 02:17.659
- I like the way <i>you</i> say

02:17.702 --> 02:19.008
"plain hamburger."

02:19.051 --> 02:20.792
- ...sleeps alone in own bed

02:20.836 --> 02:22.446
during thunderstorm...

02:22.490 --> 02:24.709
- Well loud noises
make me snuggly.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.885
- ...or cuts his own toenails!

02:26.929 --> 02:27.973
- I did do that.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.323
My shoes were starting to hurt

02:29.366 --> 02:30.802
and I didn't want to bother you

02:30.846 --> 02:32.804
while you were gnawing
on your breakfast jerky.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.198
- Your bride, Svetlana,
arrive this afternoon.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.200
You marry immediately.
- But, Baba,

02:37.244 --> 02:40.725
I intend to meet the love
of my life rom-com-style.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.379
- Rom-com?
- We'll lock eyes

02:42.423 --> 02:44.468
across a crowded room.
- Eyes.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.036
- Or bump into each other
at the office

02:47.079 --> 02:48.864
- Office?
- and I'll drop all my papers.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.866
Or we'll accidentally
reach for something

02:50.909 --> 02:52.215
at the same time and --

02:52.259 --> 02:54.391
Whoops!
That's amore!

02:54.435 --> 02:56.176
- Oops, that's a-stupid.

02:56.219 --> 02:59.179
You have traditional
old country wedding.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.398
I go knit yak-hair vest
for ceremony.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.576
I'll just hide in here
for a few years,

03:05.620 --> 03:07.578
until Baba
can respect my wishes.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.580
- Get out!
- Oh!

03:09.624 --> 03:12.409
Aah! Uhhh!
- Shh! It's me!

03:12.453 --> 03:13.671
I was just messing with you.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.499
- Trophy,
go hide in your own closet.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.849
I'm gonna to need to be
in here for a while.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.330
- But your closet's the only one
with a toilet.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.506
- There's no toilet!

03:22.550 --> 03:23.768
- Oops.
- Get out of here

03:23.812 --> 03:25.248
and let me hide in peace.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.032
Otherwise, Baba will force me

03:27.076 --> 03:29.209
into an arranged marriage.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.689
- Sorry, Pete,
but, we all saw it coming.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.778
She's been grooming you
to be her spouse

03:33.822 --> 03:35.345
since childhood.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.695
- Wait, why <i>are</i> you hiding
in here?

03:37.739 --> 03:40.916
- No reason.
Just chilling.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.874
- Aah!
- There you are, Mom.

03:42.918 --> 03:45.225
The bird watching bus
is picking us up soon.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.749
Today we try to spot
the common pigeon.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.534
I promised.
You said you would go.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.101
- Annie, not all mommies are

03:52.144 --> 03:54.103
chaperone material.

03:54.146 --> 03:56.714
- Actually, due to budget cuts,
the school district stopped

03:56.758 --> 03:58.107
doing background checks, so,

03:58.150 --> 04:00.762
everyone's
chaperone material now.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.154
- Now, where do we hide?

04:02.198 --> 04:04.635
- You know what?
I have an easy-peasy idea

04:04.679 --> 04:07.769
that can help us both.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.772
We'll keep this simple.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.774
I'll just zap my spirit
into this

04:12.817 --> 04:14.776
unclaimed corpse --

04:14.819 --> 04:16.647
Susan, here --
and then pretend to be

04:16.691 --> 04:18.910
your fiancé that you've
kept secret from Baba.

04:20.521 --> 04:23.088
- And Susan's spirit will go
into <i>your</i> body?

04:23.132 --> 04:25.482
- Yeah, her <i>dead</i> spirit.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.267
You'll just strap
some rollerblades

04:27.310 --> 04:31.967
on my lifeless body
and send <i>me</i> on the bird trip.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.751
- Please have dimples,
please have dimples.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.581
- Ah.
So, once you're inside Susan,

04:37.625 --> 04:39.322
you and I will get married,
instead,

04:39.366 --> 04:41.411
and, since it's not <i>your</i> body,

04:41.455 --> 04:43.935
it won't be weird for us to...

04:43.979 --> 04:45.807
you know.
- No! No.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.025
It's temporary.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.331
But that should be plenty
of time

04:48.375 --> 04:51.116
for you to introduce "Susan"
to Baba

04:51.160 --> 04:52.944
and get <i>her
to call off the wedding.</i>

04:52.988 --> 04:54.642
More importantly, I'll avoid

04:54.685 --> 04:57.122
that mother-daughter
pigeon thing!

04:57.166 --> 04:58.776
Okay?
Back up!

05:07.524 --> 05:09.352
- But things don't always go

05:09.396 --> 05:12.616
according to plan.

05:15.489 --> 05:16.620
- Oh, no!

05:19.362 --> 05:22.365
- Pretty sure Susan, here,
OD'd on heroin.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.541
But now I get
what all the fuss is about.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.369
- Where'd your soul land,

05:26.413 --> 05:27.631
Mr. Whiskers?

05:30.504 --> 05:32.549
- That thing is gonna
ruin my manicure!

05:32.593 --> 05:35.335
- There you are!
The bus is here!

05:35.378 --> 05:38.076
I made you that seed bark
you always refuse to try.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.644
Catch! Once you get past
the first twenty bites,

05:40.688 --> 05:42.472
you really start
to crave it, right?

05:42.516 --> 05:44.256
See ya, Pete!
Just a heads-up --

05:44.300 --> 05:45.693
that corpse isn't dead yet.

05:45.736 --> 05:46.998
Come on.

05:47.042 --> 05:50.045
- That squirrel's
gonna be a great mom.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.352
- I still can't believe
you're actually coming.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.832
You look excited, too,
but let's not have a repeat

05:54.876 --> 05:56.225
of my parent-teacher
conferences.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.183
No inciting violence, sex,

05:58.227 --> 05:59.837
or violent sex, okay?

05:59.881 --> 06:02.231
- Caw-caw, caw-caw!

06:02.274 --> 06:03.275
- Caw-caw!

06:03.319 --> 06:04.712
- And a caw-caw to you,

06:04.755 --> 06:06.409
my fellow enthusiasts.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.063
This is my mom, Trophy.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.934
See?
I told you she's real!

06:09.978 --> 06:13.111
- Glad you could finally come!

06:14.939 --> 06:17.681
- -She can migrate south on me
all winter long.

06:17.725 --> 06:18.856
Am I right, Ralphie?

06:21.163 --> 06:23.208
- You've been practicing
your bird calls.

06:23.252 --> 06:26.037
Pigeon fever is contagious!

06:27.561 --> 06:30.564
- I've never been
inside this shape before.

06:30.607 --> 06:33.393
- I think you look cute.
- Peter,

06:33.436 --> 06:36.047
I have wedding vest for you.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.614
Oh hoh hoh.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.703
Holds eye contact,

06:39.747 --> 06:42.532
doesn't cower at my scowl.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.274
I ordered
easily intimidated bride.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.623
This not Svetlana.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.452
Pete! Find return label.
I get crate.

06:49.496 --> 06:53.325
- Baba, I was afraid to tell you
before, but I'm already engaged,

06:53.369 --> 06:56.154
to this wonderful human woman,
Susan.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.547
We're very much in love,

06:57.591 --> 06:58.940
so I don't need
an arranged marriage.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.551
- You keep secret from Baba?

07:01.595 --> 07:02.813
Why?

07:02.857 --> 07:04.424
You tell me everything.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.730
- I do!
I can't argue with that!

07:06.774 --> 07:09.080
- We're so very much in love,

07:09.124 --> 07:12.432
but we were afraid you'd be
angry Pete chose his own wife.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.651
- I wasn't afraid of you, Baba.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.174
I was afraid of your reaction.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.349
- Shut face hole!

07:17.393 --> 07:19.090
Okay. Baba see

07:19.134 --> 07:21.179
if you good match for Peter.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.920
- Uh...
- First test.

07:22.964 --> 07:26.271
Why can't Peter speak,
if he looking at sweet cream?

07:26.315 --> 07:28.273
- Because Pete can't stop
drinking sweet cream

07:28.317 --> 07:30.580
until he hits 64 full ounces.

07:30.624 --> 07:31.755
- Drinking how?

07:31.799 --> 07:33.365
- In tiny sips,

07:33.409 --> 07:35.280
with his eyes clenched
shut!

07:35.324 --> 07:37.457
And his toes curled.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.633
- Lucky guess.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.464
- Okey-dokey,
Baba be straight with you.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.466
I think you corpse.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.946
The only part of me
that's dead is

07:48.990 --> 07:52.863
my ambition to lead
an independent, fulfilling life.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.386
No, thank you.

07:54.430 --> 07:58.129
- Hmm, you seem like the perfect
daughter-in-law.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.827
Maybe too perfect!

07:59.870 --> 08:02.699
- Not robot.

08:02.743 --> 08:05.310
Not marionette.
Very well.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.616
I accept this pairing.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.792
- Great.
So, Susan and I have

08:08.836 --> 08:11.186
some fiancée-ing
to go do in my room.

08:11.229 --> 08:14.319
- No. You must go
let Svetlana down in person.

08:14.363 --> 08:17.888
You meet her in half of an hour
at Fort Gator Wax Museum.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.151
- What?!
Don't make me confront Svetlana

08:20.195 --> 08:21.501
with a gallon of cream in me.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.067
I don't want any trauma

08:23.111 --> 08:24.982
attached to the cream!
- Bye-bye!

08:31.206 --> 08:34.426
- Gather 'round, George W. Bush
Memorial High birders.

08:34.470 --> 08:38.387
As you know, Annie Fantasy
organized this watch

08:38.430 --> 08:41.172
and she will now --
very briefly -- explain.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.826
- Did you know pigeons
mate for life? I do.

08:42.870 --> 08:45.046
Did you know pigeons come
in 28 different colored designs

08:45.089 --> 08:46.569
and often place their beak
inside their partner's beak

08:46.613 --> 08:47.875
to reinforce their pair bond?

08:47.918 --> 08:49.833
Separate genes control --
- Great Wikipedia

08:49.877 --> 08:51.182
energy, Annie.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.358
Here's a list
of plumage varieties

08:53.402 --> 08:55.056
and pigeon behaviors
to look for.

08:55.099 --> 08:59.103
Not sure how many we'll see,
but remember our mantra --

08:59.147 --> 09:02.367
"We <i>choose</i> to spend
our time this way."

09:02.411 --> 09:05.893
- I don't see a ring on those
slightly bluish fingers.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.548
Is there a lucky SOB at home
I should know about?

09:08.591 --> 09:10.767
That stands
for spouse-of-birder.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.557
- Women <i>love</i> to be chased.
Watch this.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.297
- Dad, you promised
to stop saying that

09:19.341 --> 09:21.473
<i>every</i> time
you see a woman running.

09:21.517 --> 09:24.564
- I think
she just spotted an ash red.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.957
Wow! I've never seen her run <i>
toward</i> something.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.090
She's a real natural at this.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.308
Coming, Mom!

09:32.267 --> 09:34.095
- Let's find Svetlana
and let her down quick,

09:34.138 --> 09:35.575
so we can get to the room

09:35.618 --> 09:38.882
of wax Patrick Swayzes!

09:38.926 --> 09:41.058
Aah!
- Easy, there.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.713
Gotta say,
this feels pretty natural.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.759
- Still your sister!
- Right.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.065
- My liver always swells
with pride,

09:48.109 --> 09:50.720
looking at Florida's
rich heritage.

09:52.461 --> 09:56.073
Don't look now,
but I think I see el brido.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.466
- Can you tell her, Troph?

09:57.509 --> 09:59.424
When I get nervous,
my throat closes up

09:59.468 --> 10:01.470
and the only sound
I can make is --

10:02.863 --> 10:05.082
- ASMR scissor snipping sounds.
I know.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.084
Fine, I'll do it.
Just meet me

10:07.128 --> 10:10.435
at the Top Moments
in Breastaurant History Gallery.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.959
- Oh thank you, thank you!

10:12.002 --> 10:13.917
- Hi, Svetlana?

10:13.961 --> 10:17.007
So, I'm sorry to tell you this,
but the marriage is off.

10:17.051 --> 10:20.315
Mm-hmm. Well, you probably want
to be alone with your thoughts,

10:20.358 --> 10:23.100
so, safe travels,
Svet-blah-blah-blah.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.671
- I love your pigeon passion,
but in birding,

10:28.715 --> 10:30.673
we don't get that close
to the action.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.196
It's different
from cock fighting.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.938
Mom! That tickles!

10:34.982 --> 10:36.679
Birding really brings out
your silly side.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.986
- What? Did you spot something?

10:39.029 --> 10:40.640
Whoa! Mom?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.165
- Your mom is scaring the birds.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.123
That violates our cardinal rule!

10:46.167 --> 10:47.516
- Don't judge, Carmen.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.127
My mom's the best birder <i>
and</i> parent here.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.781
Mom, don't!

10:52.913 --> 10:53.870
- Um, Annie.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.176
Um, is your mom

10:55.219 --> 10:57.308
number twoing in the thicket?

10:57.352 --> 11:00.485
- I should've pointed out
the restrooms back

11:00.529 --> 11:02.183
at the info center.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.489
- Must be all the birdseed
granola bars.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.361
They're really high in fiber.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.145
- Welp, that's my trigger.
You're sleeping

11:08.189 --> 11:09.712
on the pull-out couch
tonight, son.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.541
- Why did you get us bunk beds,
in the first place?

11:19.896 --> 11:21.376
- Ooh!

11:21.419 --> 11:22.507
Whoops!

11:25.119 --> 11:27.512
- Oh, excuse my pardons, please.

11:27.556 --> 11:28.818
I so nervous.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.428
I meet dream husband --

11:30.472 --> 11:32.735
his name Peter --
for first time today.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.999
- You have the deepest dimples
I've ever seen!

11:36.043 --> 11:38.698
- Sir!
You mustn't say this.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.830
I almost-married woman.

11:40.874 --> 11:41.918
- Svetlana?!

11:41.962 --> 11:43.833
<i>I'm</i> Peter!

11:43.877 --> 11:44.878
- Peter?

11:49.883 --> 11:53.103
- Mama, Mama.
snack bar?

11:53.147 --> 11:55.845
snack bar.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.369
- You have a son?
- Yes, his name is Peter Jr.

11:58.413 --> 12:01.372
I'm his biological father?!

12:01.416 --> 12:02.896
- How would that be possible?

12:02.939 --> 12:04.549
- I don't know.
Baba always says

12:04.593 --> 12:07.378
the way children appear
is none of my business.

12:07.422 --> 12:10.033
- Ah, his papa die of anxiety
during my childbirth.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.035
I never thought I marry again.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.081
But, when matchmaker called
and said

12:14.124 --> 12:17.780
wonderful man named Peter
needed an old-country wife,

12:17.824 --> 12:21.915
and my son being named Peter,
I thought for myself, maybe...

12:21.958 --> 12:24.395
- I'm like an adult version
of your son,

12:24.439 --> 12:28.573
which is every woman's
greatest desire in a husband.

12:28.617 --> 12:32.099
Is he drinking sweet cream?

12:32.142 --> 12:34.231
<i>-Da.
This sound silly.</i>

12:34.275 --> 12:38.279
It is favorite, but he like
to drink it really slow.

12:38.322 --> 12:41.891
For me, the sweeter the cream,
the stronger the meat.

12:50.857 --> 12:51.814
- Susan?

12:51.858 --> 12:53.076
Oh, my God!

12:53.120 --> 12:54.164
Susan?

12:58.168 --> 12:59.430
- Susan?

12:59.474 --> 13:01.389
- Patrick?
- You always said I resembled

13:01.432 --> 13:03.260
Patrick Swayze,
but I don't see it.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.350
- Susan?
I mean, I'm Susan.

13:06.394 --> 13:07.525
Who else would I be in her body?

13:07.569 --> 13:10.311
So you and I -- Susan --
we are...

13:10.354 --> 13:12.139
we're friends?
Hmm? Mm-hmm.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.575
- Glad you're okay.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.185
Last time we partied,
I had to leave you

13:15.229 --> 13:16.839
at the front door of the ER.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.755
- Um, thanks, um,
but why are you desecrating

13:19.799 --> 13:21.278
Mr. Point Break Swayze?

13:21.322 --> 13:22.714
- Don't you remember?

13:22.758 --> 13:25.369
I hide my illegal narcotics
all around town.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.718
Just like a squirrel.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.242
That's why they call me
Squirrel.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.766
Come on.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.029
- Huh, did you know
this big guy's addiction

13:33.073 --> 13:35.379
to eating human flesh
didn't stop him from becoming

13:35.423 --> 13:37.991
the mayor of Fort Meyers?

13:38.034 --> 13:39.644
So much to learn.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.342
Susan is smart.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.909
- You're gonna love these, Susan.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.867
I know a place where we can
sample the goods

13:44.911 --> 13:47.696
and have wasted sex
to the "Roadhouse" soundtrack.

13:47.739 --> 13:50.003
Just like the old days, Susan.
Remember?

13:50.046 --> 13:51.961
Just like before I took you
to the ER.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.181
- I'm going to have
the time of my life.

13:54.224 --> 13:57.793
And I owe it all to Sue.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.925
- Phew!

13:58.968 --> 14:00.709
Nice viewing perch.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.493
Did you lead me up here
so we could sneak

14:02.537 --> 14:05.018
in a little
mother-daughter bonding time?

14:05.061 --> 14:06.410
- There are so many things

14:06.454 --> 14:08.717
I've been
wanting to talk with you about.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.240
I had this dream
a couple days ago

14:10.284 --> 14:12.242
where I wore shorts to school

14:12.286 --> 14:14.549
and things seemed
to go pretty well?

14:14.592 --> 14:17.073
Do you think my calves
could handle that in real life?

14:17.117 --> 14:20.120
Because I think clamdiggers
are the best I can do right now.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.425
- What a magical day.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.211
I feel like
we're finally connecting.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.908
I love you, Mom.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.738
- Wait a minute.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.000
Food deposits in cheeks.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.393
Climbing ability.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.743
Number two'ing outside
in the daytime.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.484
You switched souls

14:36.527 --> 14:38.790
with a squirrel
to avoid my field trip!

14:38.834 --> 14:39.922
Didn't you?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.968
But you did send your body.

14:42.011 --> 14:45.623
I guess that means you really
do care about me.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.887
You just misinterpret
my radical acceptance

14:47.930 --> 14:49.801
as stupidity, don't you?

14:49.845 --> 14:52.021
Don't you? Aww.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.936
Well, at least you didn't
make me go to

14:53.980 --> 14:56.460
another school thing alone.
That's something.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.245
- How about a ride
back down the tree?

15:02.466 --> 15:04.512
- Dasha, arranged marriage off.

15:04.555 --> 15:08.037
Peter already have secret
fiancée who might be his sister.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.300
I know.
This Old country way,

15:10.344 --> 15:13.825
but I always thought Petey fall
in love "The Fast & The Furious"

15:13.869 --> 15:17.960
style, where sexual tension
meet illegal street racing,

15:18.004 --> 15:22.182
resulting in makeshift family
of gorgeous misfits.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.358
Ah, oh, well. Bye-bye.

15:26.142 --> 15:29.624
So, you telling me these kids
get break from college,

15:29.667 --> 15:32.801
drink malt lemonade,
walk into ocean and die,

15:32.844 --> 15:35.673
and then you make the money
from their funerals?

15:35.717 --> 15:38.198
This is the American dream.

15:38.241 --> 15:41.288
- I know. It sounds like
a fairytale, but it's true.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.942
- Tell us more, Dada.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.640
- I having too much fun, Peter.

15:45.683 --> 15:48.643
I so glad you too milky
to find own wife.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.471
- Svetlana, I need
to tell you something --

15:52.081 --> 15:53.996
It's my mother.
I should take this.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.347
You might as well get used
to her coming between us.

15:57.391 --> 15:58.958
- Of course, my Peter.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.742
- Baba, I'm glad you called.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.049
About Svetlana,
I think I love her.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.528
- Baba fix.

16:04.572 --> 16:05.877
Bring Susan home now.

16:05.921 --> 16:07.401
Wedding need to start ASAP

16:07.444 --> 16:09.229
because Baba go to bed
in 30 minute.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.535
- What?
No, Baba, you don't under--

16:11.579 --> 16:14.974
- Baba find Svetlana new fiancé
approved by village.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.236
Amazing man.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.107
Lives four blocks from beach.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.674
More hair on arms.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.806
Matchmaker calling Svetlana now.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.026
- Baba, wait!
I love Svetlana, not Susan.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.332
Oh, no!

16:25.375 --> 16:26.768
- How much hair on arms?
- Svetlana!

16:26.811 --> 16:28.552
- And what about fingers?

16:28.596 --> 16:30.380
- Oh! That's a lot better!

16:30.424 --> 16:31.686
- Svetlana!
- Thank you.

16:31.729 --> 16:34.645
- Peter, my great day
now even better.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.474
Since you lie to me and not say
you already engaged

16:37.518 --> 16:40.651
to local woman,
I get to marry man named Choad.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.089
- Susan isn't really my fiancée.

16:43.132 --> 16:47.267
I only told Baba she was because
I wanted to find love on my own.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.311
Then I did.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.313
With you and Pete Jr.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.272
Let's forget about
Susan and Choad.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.708
Call the matchmaker back.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.318
Tell her
you're going to marry me.

16:55.362 --> 16:58.234
- Peter, oh,
sweet foolish Peter.

16:58.278 --> 17:01.672
Don't you know that love always
begins by deceiving one's self,

17:01.716 --> 17:04.023
and always ends
by deceiving others.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.460
That is what the world
calls romance.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.939
Plus, Choad has hairier arms.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.550
You understand.
- No!

17:09.593 --> 17:11.030
No!

17:11.073 --> 17:12.335
If I had to do it over,

17:12.379 --> 17:13.728
I would have never
gotten engaged

17:13.771 --> 17:15.556
to my resurrected
sister's spirit

17:15.599 --> 17:19.429
inside another woman's
decaying corpse.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.518
- Like turducken. Yes, I see.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.390
I wish you every happiness,
Peter.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.957
Go to corpse-sister Susan,
work things out.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.221
Maybe we meet again one day.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.835
- We're almost at the end
of the trail, everyone.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.924
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.100
If you'd joined
loom club instead,

17:38.144 --> 17:41.712
you would've gotten to make
a potholder this afternoon.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.367
But remember our other motto.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.370
- No club prepares you
for life's disappointments

17:47.414 --> 17:49.155
like birding club.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.592
-Shh! I hear a bird.

17:51.635 --> 17:52.897
A living one.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.290
Try to spot it, everybody.

17:54.334 --> 17:57.337
- Oh, my gosh,
it's a white-crested pied.

17:57.380 --> 18:00.601
It's got a nest full of eggs!

18:01.950 --> 18:03.343
- Ms. Fantasy, halt!

18:03.386 --> 18:04.909
By the order of
the bird watchers!

18:04.953 --> 18:06.433
- That's not a real thing,
Ralphie.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.870
- Your mother is going
right up to the nest.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.480
Why is she getting so close?

18:10.524 --> 18:12.265
- Maybe we could bribe her
back down.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.049
Does anyone see any acorns?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.790
- Don't feed her more!

18:15.833 --> 18:17.531
We don't need to
watch her poop again.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.750
- Speak for yourself, Carmen.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.811
- Annie, I can't believe this.

18:36.854 --> 18:40.510
Your mother appears
to be communicating with a bird!

18:40.554 --> 18:41.772
- That's my mom.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.383
- Why don't you ever talk
to birds?

18:43.426 --> 18:45.428
- Baby, I can barely talk
to your father.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.952
- She's bringing down the pigeon
and the nest!

18:49.302 --> 18:50.477
- Oh, wow.
- Amazing.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.000
- Your mother really knows

18:52.043 --> 18:54.742
how to spice up ornithology,
Annie.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.918
- I think the eggs
are about to hatch.

18:56.961 --> 19:00.095
Birders, get your cameras out.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.838
- Oh, the miracle of --

19:03.881 --> 19:06.841
Oh!

19:06.884 --> 19:08.625
- No one ever comes in here.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.106
- So how hard
do we like to party?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.587
Because it's been too long
for old Susan.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.589
Foreplay.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.199
- Oh, Susan, these will make you

19:17.243 --> 19:19.767
hallucinate eight heads
on everyone.

19:19.810 --> 19:23.553
So it'll feel like an orgy
with just the two of us.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.251
- Oh, wait. Damn it.

19:25.294 --> 19:28.254
I have one more stash in
the "Garfield & Friends" wing.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.429
Don't move.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.213
I'll be right back.

19:31.257 --> 19:34.608
- I'm about to get high and boink
might-as-well-be Patrick Swayze.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.480
And to think I could be
on a birdwatching trip!

19:38.873 --> 19:40.266
- No! No, no.

19:40.309 --> 19:41.789
Time can't be up yet.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.704
No, no, no!

19:51.538 --> 19:52.974
- Not again.

19:53.017 --> 19:55.194
- Hey, Andre, I found
that misplaced hitchhiker

19:55.237 --> 19:57.370
from the Hall of
Dangerous Situations for Women.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.242
I'mma take her back.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.941
- I'd better not still be on that
fucking birdwatching trip!

20:09.208 --> 20:12.385
- You discovered an entirely
new species, Mom.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.908
Even if you really
are a squirrel,

20:13.951 --> 20:16.171
this is the best day
we've ever had.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.738
Thank you.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.091
- Shit.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.658
Ugh!

20:24.701 --> 20:26.137
Did I eat carbs today?

20:26.181 --> 20:28.618
- You were a great Mom today.

20:28.662 --> 20:31.055
- I was? Oh, fabulous.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.361
Maybe for your choir recital

20:32.405 --> 20:34.668
I can swap bodies
with the morgue goat.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.800
- He does love Philip Glass.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.760
- That was just amazing,
Mrs. Fantasy.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.283
Birder of the year!

20:41.327 --> 20:43.329
Birder of the year!

20:43.372 --> 20:46.288
Chant with me, I'm feeling
very self-conscious right now.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.811
- Birder of the Year!

20:47.855 --> 20:49.770
Birder of the Year!
Birder of the Year!

20:49.813 --> 20:52.033
- That's me.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.861
- Trophy! There you are.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.646
I think we should just get
married to appease Baba.

20:56.690 --> 21:00.128
That's what my therapist calls
"exactly the problem."

21:05.264 --> 21:08.789
Okay, so maybe no s-e-x, but...

21:10.399 --> 21:13.707
Whoa!

21:13.750 --> 21:15.274
So...

21:15.317 --> 21:17.493
what's your son's name?

21:52.963 --> 21:54.791
- Cream, Mama?

21:54.835 --> 21:57.751
- Hey, I told you,
no more of that stuff.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.928
Only <i>freaks</i> drink sweet cream!

22:00.971 --> 22:03.931
- Choad, please!
- You better start acting right

22:03.974 --> 22:07.587
if you want to earn
the name of Choad Jr.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.980
- Maybe I should
have married Peter.

22:10.024 --> 22:13.506
Oh, if only his arms
had more hairs.
