01:10.220 --> 01:12.404
JK. I just learned about JK.

01:12.556 --> 01:15.407
-Joshing kindly.
-Guys, huge news over here.

01:15.634 --> 01:18.077
Last night, Honeybee and I
were at the Gazebo Depot--

01:18.228 --> 01:21.154
you know, gazebo gazing--
and we ran into Mayor Peppers.

01:21.307 --> 01:22.897
We told him about our new
video event company,

01:22.917 --> 01:25.642
-Pause for Applause.
-And he said he might hire us

01:25.735 --> 01:29.571
as videographers for his most
beloved niece's birthday party!

01:29.590 --> 01:33.092
Oh, I can't believe that little
Becky Peppers is already 37.

01:33.243 --> 01:36.653
Sounds like opportunity has
mounted the porch and knocked.

01:36.672 --> 01:38.171
Well, it's not our job yet.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.823
Mayor Peppers wants
to see what we can do

01:39.842 --> 01:41.491
with a lower-stakes
project first.

01:41.510 --> 01:44.494
Yup. He wants us to make a video
tribute to our beloved town

01:44.513 --> 01:46.179
for everyone to see
at the annual

01:46.332 --> 01:48.682
State of the Moose:
Lone Moose Moose Banquet.

01:48.834 --> 01:52.277
Is it time for the
S-O-T-M-L-double M-B already?

01:52.429 --> 01:55.339
I can't wait to celebrate
all the great new developments

01:55.357 --> 01:56.764
in Lone Moose this year.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.934
Like the new dog-poop bag
station near the merry-go-round.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.286
It's gorgeous.

02:01.438 --> 02:03.605
And the taxidermied bear
at the library

02:03.699 --> 02:05.031
that finally got restuffed.

02:05.184 --> 02:06.700
Nice smooth belly, no lumps.

02:06.852 --> 02:09.777
Or the new cuckoo clock factory
that's moving here.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.356
It's going
to create over 12 jobs.

02:12.449 --> 02:14.191
13. 13 jobs.

Sorry I yelled so loud.

02:30.467 --> 02:33.134

-You? Ham Tobin?

02:33.228 --> 02:35.303
Three-time Good Behavior Award
Champion?

02:35.322 --> 02:38.473
God, no. I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.142
Oh, I'm okay. A lot of it
pooled in my pockets.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.477
I'll just dump it out
when I get home.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.813
Sounds good.
Ham Tobin in trouble.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.958
Sheesh.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.247
-all day.
-Oh. Hey, Ham.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.916
Oh. Hello, cool.
I mean Quay.

02:56.068 --> 02:57.234
I saw what happened back there.

02:57.252 --> 02:58.343
I mean, actually, I heard it.

02:58.495 --> 03:01.238
-Oh, the scream?
-Don't be embarrassed.

03:01.256 --> 03:02.664
-It sounded awesome.
-Really? Thanks.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.999
I'm not even the best yeller
in my family.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.335
My brother Wolf
is the real scream queen.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.021
Well, it gave me an idea.
I was wondering

03:09.172 --> 03:11.839
if you want to try out for my
punk band, Messengers of Chaos.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.585

if that's your scene.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.595
Huh. I'm hard-core sometimes.
I think.

03:25.614 --> 03:27.447
Cool. You want
to audition after school?

03:27.599 --> 03:29.208
Uh, I don't know.
(short chuckle)

03:29.435 --> 03:31.210
Is it necessary
to change vacuum attachments

03:31.361 --> 03:33.286

He just got his appendix out,

-Stay punk.
-I will.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.319
I... will.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.174
Hello there, Ham. Better hang up
your coat and wash your hands--

08:29.401 --> 08:30.825
we're eating in front
of<i> Wheel of Fortune.</i>

08:30.919 --> 08:32.402
It's Teachers Week.

08:32.495 --> 08:34.012
<i> QUAY:</i>
<i> Parents are the worst...</i>
<i> the worst...</i>

08:34.163 --> 08:35.663
<i> STEVEN:</i>
<i> Spaghetti and garlic</i>
<i> bread</i> again.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.833
Ham, did you hear me?
Can you wash your hands?

08:38.927 --> 08:41.077
<i> You</i> wash my hands.

08:41.096 --> 08:43.188
Uh... it was just a suggestion.

08:43.339 --> 08:45.690
You know your own hands.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.602
Whoops. It seems like
you accidentally

08:49.755 --> 08:51.345
missed the coat hook there.

08:51.439 --> 08:54.941
Or-- I don't know-- maybe
I laid my jacket carelessly

08:55.093 --> 08:56.276
on the ground on purpose.

08:56.428 --> 08:58.945
Come on, bud. Are you low
on potassium again?

08:59.097 --> 09:00.872
Do you need a banana?

09:01.024 --> 09:03.433
No, thank you.

09:03.451 --> 09:06.770
Do you know you put a banana
on your coat, son?

09:06.788 --> 09:08.772
Yeah, Dad, I do.

09:08.790 --> 09:09.956
Okay.

09:10.108 --> 09:11.716
(groans)

09:11.868 --> 09:13.943
I just don't feel like

09:13.962 --> 09:16.780
hanging my jacket, okay?!

09:16.798 --> 09:18.448
We're back on the jacket.

09:18.466 --> 09:20.116
Sometimes when you tell me
to do something,

09:20.135 --> 09:22.543
uh, I don't feel like doing it.

09:22.637 --> 09:24.211
And you know what else?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.713
I'm... I'm quitting
Chore Chiefs.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.065
At least for a day.

09:27.216 --> 09:28.733
-Then we'll see.
-Whoa.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.960
Hmm. Well,
this is new territory for us,

09:30.979 --> 09:34.964
but I guess I should punish you
or something for acting out?

09:35.058 --> 09:37.300
Maybe go
take a break in your room.

09:37.319 --> 09:39.369
Fine!

09:40.972 --> 09:43.139
Do you want to help me finish
setting up the TV trays?

09:43.232 --> 09:44.916
Sure. Where is everybody?

09:45.143 --> 09:46.993
Don't they know
it's Teachers Week on<i> Wheel?</i>

09:47.145 --> 09:48.995
I'd like
to solve the puzzle, Moon.

09:49.147 --> 09:52.090
"I forgot to remind them."

09:52.759 --> 09:54.259
These candy corn lights
are like, "What?

09:54.486 --> 09:55.985
It's not Halloween, right?"

09:56.079 --> 09:58.504
My dumb dad said they were cheap
and a fire hazard,

09:58.657 --> 10:01.082
so he wouldn't let me hang them
at our house.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.009
I'm so sorry, Quay.

10:03.161 --> 10:04.661
(sighs)
Thanks, Bethany.

10:04.679 --> 10:07.588
Yeah, my, uh, my dad
sent me to my room last night

10:07.682 --> 10:09.999
because I said I didn't
want to do chores anymore.

10:10.093 --> 10:11.592
And I was in there
for 45 minutes

10:11.612 --> 10:14.671
-before my sister came
and got me for dessert.
-Damn.

10:14.689 --> 10:16.097
Yeah.
It's kind of like...

10:16.191 --> 10:17.616
Parents-- don't they know
that they're jerks?

10:17.843 --> 10:21.361
G-Getting on my case,
making me do homework?

10:21.513 --> 10:24.105

10:45.145 --> 10:47.646
Gill Beavers, your manager,
got you a gig.

10:47.873 --> 10:50.297
-Yes! -Whoa.

-Messengers Of Chaos.

and there's no budget,
so we're in.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.767
We have to play "Parents,"
for sure.

11:01.920 --> 11:02.977
It's our best song.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.570
Lone Moose is about
to get a wake-up call.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.152

coming along?

11:11.171 --> 11:14.339
Very well. We already have
35 hours of footage.

11:14.566 --> 11:15.823
Oh, hello, Ham.

11:15.917 --> 11:18.826
I assume I shouldn't ask you
about washing your hands.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.237
Uh-oh.
Here come the fireworks.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.014
That's right, Dad.
I will wash them

11:23.166 --> 11:24.349
if I want to,
which I already did.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.333
Great.
So, how was your day?

11:26.428 --> 11:28.836
Good. We had band practice
at Gill Beavers' house.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.672
Director's note: get footage
of band practice for film.

11:31.766 --> 11:34.267
Great idea, my Taika Wife-titi.

11:34.419 --> 11:36.177
(gasps)
Oh. And we have a gig.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.013
At the State of the Moose:

11:39.032 --> 11:40.273
-Wonderful, son.
-Wow, holy toast!

11:40.425 --> 11:42.016
We're even gonna play
a new song I wrote.

11:42.035 --> 11:46.429
It's called "Pare... rr..."

11:46.448 --> 11:48.097
What, Ham?

11:48.116 --> 11:50.116
What is the new song
you wrote called?

11:50.268 --> 11:52.043
"Pair... of Friends."

11:52.195 --> 11:54.103
About two friends
who go on a fishing trip.

11:54.122 --> 11:55.455

11:55.607 --> 11:56.789

-Fantastic.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.325
Buddy, I'm worried
about that song.

12:32.477 --> 12:35.069
You're really going to sing that
in front of Dad at the banquet?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.329
About parents sucking?

12:36.481 --> 12:38.239
I mean, you might as well
pull out Dad's heart

Hey, when you play
the blondie song at the banquet,

12:53.164 --> 12:54.755
can you mention
I helped write it?

12:55.517 --> 12:58.501
Hey, Dad. How's
the wood-chopping coming along?

12:58.594 --> 13:01.187
(grunts)
There's still a lot more to do.

13:01.339 --> 13:04.340
-So, it's great.
-Um, I was wondering something.

13:04.359 --> 13:06.934
What would you do
if someone called you a jerk?

13:07.028 --> 13:09.436
A jerk? Ouch.
That'd be tough,

13:09.531 --> 13:12.865
especially if it was someone
I cared about and respected.

13:13.018 --> 13:15.794
But I'd probably get over it
within a matter of months.

13:15.945 --> 13:17.111
-Months, huh?
-Ham,

13:17.130 --> 13:18.797
did someone at school
call you a jerk?

13:19.024 --> 13:22.041
Is that why you put a banana
on your coat the other night?

13:22.193 --> 13:24.377
Uh, no, Dad.
No one called me a jerk.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.380
Hmm. Well, whatever it is,
I will try to help.

13:27.532 --> 13:30.624
I know I don't always understand
what you're going through,

13:30.644 --> 13:33.645
and the Chore Chiefs hasn't been
the same without you this week,

13:33.796 --> 13:36.055
but I'm glad
we're communicating.

13:36.149 --> 13:40.151

14:23.922 --> 14:25.104
Is everything okay?

14:25.198 --> 14:27.273

I could edit this thing,

but the cut's 19 hours
and 11 minutes long.

14:34.357 --> 14:36.040
Babe, we can cut it down.

14:36.192 --> 14:39.026
How? Everything Judy did
was solid gold.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.437
And Dad. And Moon.
It's all gold.

14:41.530 --> 14:43.381
It's just one giant
gold sandwich

14:43.608 --> 14:46.700
with hundreds of slices of gold
smothered in gold sauce.

14:49.781 --> 14:51.872
was eight hours long,
and it turned out perfect.

14:51.966 --> 14:54.467
Yeah, but they had the best
people in the world working

14:54.619 --> 14:57.228
on<i> Maze Runner 2: The Scorch</i>
<i> Trials</i> and a lot of time.

14:57.455 --> 14:59.122

and I have no idea
what it's gonna be.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.458
Babe, when John Krasinski
has a script problem

15:02.477 --> 15:05.219
who pulls out that big red pen
and goes nuts?

15:05.238 --> 15:08.055
-Ah, his wife, Emily Blunt.
-Exactly.

15:08.149 --> 15:10.700
Now, let's cut the crust off
this panini.

15:12.228 --> 15:14.913
Guys, hey, um,
about the song tonight.

15:15.064 --> 15:16.322
I was thinking about it,

15:16.474 --> 15:18.416
and I don't think "Parents"
rocks quite hard enough.

15:18.643 --> 15:20.084
Yeah, so, um, I came up

15:20.311 --> 15:22.145
with an even better song
we can play instead.

it's not "Parents" level great.

PEPPERS:
Good evening, everyone.

15:48.173 --> 15:49.338
I am Mayor Peppers, and tonight

15:49.432 --> 15:51.265
we're here to talk about
Lone Moose.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.451
But first, let us acknowledge
that before this place

15:53.602 --> 15:56.103
was called "Lone Moose"
by some very cold

15:56.122 --> 15:57.604
and very grabby Europeans,

15:57.699 --> 16:00.850
it was the homeland of my
ancestors, the Sugpiaq people,

16:00.868 --> 16:03.369
for thousands and thousands
and thousands of years.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.630
And while land acknowledgements
are fine,

16:05.781 --> 16:08.615
it'd be better if they just went
ahead and gave the land back.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.711
I'd also like to say that
I believe Vera over there

16:11.805 --> 16:13.787
took my cupcake caddy
Tupperware

16:13.881 --> 16:15.381
at last month's bingo night.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.217
So, if you feel like giving her
a disapproving head shake,

16:18.369 --> 16:19.626
by all means, go for it.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.388
And now it's time
to let the Moose loose.

16:22.540 --> 16:26.375
Later, we'll be hearing from the
CEO of the cuckoo clock factory.

16:26.394 --> 16:29.303
But first, help me welcome

Paul Reingold.

17:12.106 --> 17:13.939
Cuckoo.
What do you think of

17:14.034 --> 17:15.775
when you hear the word "cuckoo"?

17:16.427 --> 17:20.163
Wrong. What you should think
is inspiration.

17:24.102 --> 17:25.768
-Ham? Hey, what's going on?
-Dad.

17:25.861 --> 17:27.027
(clears throat, sighs)

17:27.121 --> 17:28.287
I have a confession to make.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.881
I was about
to sing a terrible song

17:30.032 --> 17:31.532
about how parents are jerks,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.276
and then everyone would think
I was singing about you,

17:33.294 --> 17:36.054
including you, but it's not
even about you. Not really.

17:36.205 --> 17:38.631
Well, what do
the song words say?

17:38.783 --> 17:41.634
Hmm. You know,
just that parents are jerks

17:41.786 --> 17:44.228
and that they stink and
they're dumb and they're bossy.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.971
You know, that kind of thing.

17:46.124 --> 17:47.973
Ham, it's okay.
In fact,

17:48.126 --> 17:49.975
I have honestly been relieved

17:50.128 --> 17:51.961
to finally see
your rebellious side.

17:51.979 --> 17:55.573
I mean, you have always been
so agreeable and so helpful.

17:55.724 --> 17:57.909
You don't earn the title
Chore Chief for nothing.

17:58.060 --> 17:59.802
I love being a Chore Chief.

17:59.821 --> 18:02.822
I guess I am hard-core
about hard chores.

18:02.974 --> 18:04.323
I know you are, son.

18:04.475 --> 18:07.326
But it's okay
to explore your rebellious side.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.088
-Really?
-Yes, and I would be honored

18:10.315 --> 18:12.924
for you to sing
a disparaging song about me.

18:13.075 --> 18:15.426
-(gasps) You would?
-Very much.

18:15.653 --> 18:17.987
And if being a proud parent
makes me a jerk,

18:18.005 --> 18:20.005
then I'm the jerkiest parent
there is.

18:20.158 --> 18:21.841
You call me Beef Jerky.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.250
Thanks, Beef Jerky.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.312
Now get in there
and give me hell.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.849
Hey, sorry about that,
everybody.

18:30.001 --> 18:33.277
You know, punk rock is about
saying what you really think,

18:33.504 --> 18:34.595
no matter what.

18:34.689 --> 18:36.781
It also seems
to be about wearing army coats

18:36.932 --> 18:38.098
with lots of buttons.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.450
Honestly, I'm still learning.

18:39.602 --> 18:42.178
Anyway, this song is about
what I really think.

18:42.271 --> 18:44.163
It's called "Parents."

19:11.634 --> 19:13.300
-Hey, Ham.
-Hey, Quay.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.211
Sorry that I changed the lyrics
of our song

19:15.229 --> 19:17.229
into a song
about how I like parents.

19:17.382 --> 19:19.139
If you want to kick me out
of the band, I get it.

19:19.233 --> 19:21.492
Actually, that was
really punk rock,

19:21.644 --> 19:23.402
changing the words at
the last minute like that. Plus,

19:23.496 --> 19:27.223
my mom liked it, and she kind
of does a lot of stuff for me.
