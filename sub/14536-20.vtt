WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:05.946
I can't find
my French book anywhere.

00:05.981 --> 00:09.232
Probably because
you take Spanish.

00:09.268 --> 00:10.625
That explains it.

00:13.030 --> 00:15.255
Don't look now.
Here comes Alexis.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.040
I can't stand that girl.

00:17.075 --> 00:19.651
- Hi, KC.
- Hey, girl.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.120
So... did you hear?

00:22.155 --> 00:25.040
The school's top student
is being interviewed by

00:25.075 --> 00:27.125
<i>Scholastic Accomplishments
Quarterly.</i>

00:27.160 --> 00:29.086
<i>Scholastic Accomplishments
Quarterly?</i>

00:29.121 --> 00:30.415
That is, like,
<i>the</i> quarterly publication

00:30.439 --> 00:32.239
for scholastic accomplishments.

00:32.274 --> 00:33.873
I have been dying
to get that interview.

00:33.909 --> 00:34.616
Thank you for the heads up.

00:34.651 --> 00:37.953
Ooh, this is awkward.

00:37.988 --> 00:39.913
They're actually
interviewing me.

00:39.948 --> 00:42.282
Sorry. Thought you knew.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.766
Wait, so you just click-clacked
all the way over here

00:48.790 --> 00:50.841
to rub it in her face?

00:50.876 --> 00:52.245
Why can't you just
post your brags online

00:52.269 --> 00:54.919
like everyone else?

00:54.955 --> 00:57.205
Let me just get this straight.

00:57.241 --> 00:59.132
Um, they decided to interview
the student

00:59.167 --> 01:00.478
with the second-highest
GPS in the school?

01:00.502 --> 01:02.669
No, the first.

01:02.705 --> 01:04.374
Turns out I'm actually
the smartest student

01:04.398 --> 01:06.739
in the entire DC-Metro area.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.984
Well, if that were true,
you would know

01:10.020 --> 01:13.505
that I am the smartest student
in the entire DC-Metro area.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.757
Tell it to<i> Scholastic</i>
<i>Accomplishments Quarterly.</i>

01:15.793 --> 01:17.667
Oh, that's right.

01:17.703 --> 01:18.863
They don't wanna talk to you.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.067
Well, are you sure
you're not being interviewed by

01:26.103 --> 01:29.245
<i>Obnoxious Accomplishments
Quarterly?</i>

01:29.280 --> 01:30.792
Why do you let her
get to you like that?

01:30.816 --> 01:33.158
She's been driving you crazy
since we were little kids.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.876
I have my reasons.

01:37.539 --> 01:39.522
Nice turkey, KC.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.318
- Thanks, Alexis.
- Just not as nice as mine.

01:43.678 --> 01:45.962
Are those real feathers?

01:45.997 --> 01:47.547
Mm-hmm.

01:47.582 --> 01:50.450
( Shrieking ) My boa.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.394
I've been de-plumed.

01:54.639 --> 01:57.257
Nobody plucks
my best friend's feathers.

01:57.293 --> 01:59.067
You're going down.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.313
I'm not letting her
get away with this.

02:03.348 --> 02:05.518
I'm going to the principal, because I
know I have a higher GPA than her,

02:05.542 --> 02:07.392
and I'm getting that interview.

02:07.427 --> 02:08.830
Are you sure you wanna
be in the nerd report?

02:08.854 --> 02:11.413
Hint: If you want a social
life, the answer is no.

02:13.675 --> 02:17.177
Okay. Good-bye to you, too.

02:17.212 --> 02:18.740
I swear, it's like no one
listens to me.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.396
Every time I have
something to say...

02:20.432 --> 02:22.157
( theme song begins playing )

02:22.192 --> 02:25.785
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

02:25.820 --> 02:28.981
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

02:29.057 --> 02:31.942
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

02:31.977 --> 02:36.996
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:37.032 --> 02:40.700
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:40.735 --> 02:42.794
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:42.830 --> 02:46.865
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:46.900 --> 02:50.760
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:50.796 --> 02:52.829
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:52.864 --> 02:55.107
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:55.142 --> 02:57.292
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:57.328 --> 02:59.402
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:59.437 --> 03:01.371
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

03:01.406 --> 03:03.615
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

03:03.650 --> 03:06.251
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

03:06.286 --> 03:07.602
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

03:07.637 --> 03:09.963
I keep it undercover.

03:09.998 --> 03:10.998
I keep it undercover.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.321
So I reviewed my transcript
with the principal,

03:17.356 --> 03:21.966
and it turns out I do have
a higher GPA than she does.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.721
So I will be meeting with a reporter
from the magazine tomorrow.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.195
I was right.

03:26.231 --> 03:28.548
May I remind you, we're spies.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.892
We go undercover,
not on the cover.

03:30.927 --> 03:32.235
You can't do that interview.

03:32.270 --> 03:33.987
Ernie, I earned it, okay?

03:34.022 --> 03:35.989
I'm not gonna give it up.

03:36.024 --> 03:37.633
You should know
better than anyone.

03:37.635 --> 03:39.784
There should be more to life
than just being a spy.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.729
School means a lot to me,
and I worked hard,

03:42.765 --> 03:44.375
and I think I deserve
to have my work recognized.

03:44.399 --> 03:46.199
The Organization
will never allow it.

03:46.234 --> 03:48.443
The Organization
will never find out,

03:48.479 --> 03:50.345
because you will
keep your mouth shut.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.974
Look, Mom and Dad
are away on a mission,

03:54.009 --> 03:55.637
so I'm gonna have to step into
their roles for a second.

03:55.661 --> 03:57.978
( Sighs )

04:00.199 --> 04:01.599
I know how bad
you want this, buddy.

04:03.752 --> 04:05.235
And I know
how hard you've worked.

04:05.270 --> 04:07.412
I do.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.497
But you've gotta
cancel that interview.

04:09.532 --> 04:11.791
Okay, fine. I will.

04:11.827 --> 04:13.701
Proud of ya.

04:13.737 --> 04:15.587
Glad we had this talk, princess.

04:15.622 --> 04:16.955
Okay, all right, this is weird.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.884
C.W. Barnes,<i> Scholastic</i>
<i>Accomplishments Quarterly.</i>

04:28.919 --> 04:30.735
Oh. KC Cooper,

04:30.771 --> 04:34.806
scholastic accomplishments
constantly.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.819
I have to tell you, I'm very
excited about this interview.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.127
I have read every issue
of your magazine.

04:39.163 --> 04:40.312
Yes. I am the one.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.458
I know what you did.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.777
And you know what you did.

04:50.281 --> 04:52.641
Well, I'm excited, too.

04:52.676 --> 04:53.853
I think these next two days
are gonna be a lot of fun.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.645
Two days?

04:56.680 --> 05:00.749
That seems like a lot of time
for just a little blurb,

05:00.784 --> 05:02.036
unless you spend the first day
and a half looking for a pen.

05:02.060 --> 05:04.293
Blurb? Uh, I don't think so.

05:04.329 --> 05:06.980
I wanna do an in-depth article,

05:07.016 --> 05:09.558
the likes of which
they have never seen before.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.440
For the next 48 hours,
I'm gonna be your shadow.

05:13.305 --> 05:15.246
Oh, really?

05:15.281 --> 05:17.406
Yes. I'm gonna find
out where you go,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.142
what you do,
and who you do it with.

05:19.177 --> 05:22.161
I'm gonna uncover all of
your deepest, darkest secrets.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.858
I'm gonna find out
everything there is to know

05:23.882 --> 05:27.308
about KC Cooper.

05:27.344 --> 05:29.652
Well, um, the first thing
you should know

05:29.688 --> 05:34.390
is that KC Cooper is a fraud.

05:34.426 --> 05:37.143
Yeah, I am a fraud.

05:37.178 --> 05:39.287
A lyin', stinkin',
cheatin' fraud,

05:39.322 --> 05:40.938
and you cannot have me
in your magazine.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.949
I don't understand.

05:42.985 --> 05:45.460
Neither do I.
I don't understand anything.

05:45.495 --> 05:47.957
In fact, I don't even understand
what the word understand means

05:47.981 --> 05:49.656
which is why I cheat,
all the time,

05:49.691 --> 05:53.401
off of this young lady here.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.029
This much more smarter
than me lady.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.907
( Chuckles ) That's not
even correct English,

05:58.942 --> 06:01.843
but I don't even know how to
speak it, 'cause I'm dumb.

06:01.879 --> 06:04.154
C.W., this is the person
that you need to be talking to.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.981
Alexis, she is the... ahem...

06:07.017 --> 06:10.626
smartest person in our class.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.071
( Nervous chuckle )
In the entire DC-Metro area.

06:22.274 --> 06:25.617
Take it easy.
The drive to a mission

06:25.652 --> 06:27.835
shouldn't be
the most dangerous part.

06:27.871 --> 06:29.745
I think someone's following us.

06:29.781 --> 06:31.931
I promise, just like on
all your social media,

06:31.966 --> 06:35.927
no one is following you.

06:35.962 --> 06:38.163
Then I guess I'm just
upset about that interview.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.163
That reporter
really got in my head.

06:39.198 --> 06:42.109
The reporter? The reporter?!

06:42.185 --> 06:44.311
You mean the reporter
I told you not to talk to?

06:44.346 --> 06:46.496
That reporter?

06:46.532 --> 06:47.609
Why do you always think
you know better than me?

06:47.633 --> 06:53.461
Because 99.999% of the time,
I do know better than you.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.007
I'm telling you,
someone is tailing us.

06:55.031 --> 06:56.380
You're paranoid. Relax.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.191
- You relax.
- I am relaxed.

06:58.226 --> 07:01.403
- ( Horn honking )
- ( shrieking )

07:01.438 --> 07:02.678
Can you relax a little quieter?

07:07.561 --> 07:09.297
ERNIE: <i>You need to intercept
the Other Side agent</i>

07:09.321 --> 07:11.204
<i>before he can make the drop.</i>

07:11.239 --> 07:12.480
<i>We need that flash drive.</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:14.699
Wait. Sh.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.835
- I think I've got a tail.
<i>- This again?</i>

07:16.870 --> 07:18.428
The targets are six blocks away.

07:18.463 --> 07:21.664
If you've got company,
they're not on the guest list.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.634
You would know all about not being
on a guest list, wouldn't you?

07:24.669 --> 07:26.444
<i>And by the way,</i>

07:26.479 --> 07:29.572
I have 112 followers.

07:29.607 --> 07:32.917
One more word
and you're down to 111.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.328
I hear footsteps.
Ernie, I'm right about this.

07:35.405 --> 07:37.280
- Someone is following me.
- <i>Yes, KC, we know.</i>

07:37.315 --> 07:38.915
You're always right.
Now get outta there.

07:42.754 --> 07:43.929
Yeah, that's right.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.614
Eat dirt, scuzzball.

07:45.649 --> 07:47.515
You are dealing with
the youngest

07:47.551 --> 07:49.391
senior junior secret agent
in the Organization.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.757
Can I quote you on that, KC?

08:04.309 --> 08:06.434
What were you saying about being

08:06.470 --> 08:07.769
the youngest junior secret what?

08:07.804 --> 08:10.405
Wow.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.023
You must've hit
the ground pretty hard,

08:12.058 --> 08:15.109
because, uh, I don't know
what you're talking about,

08:15.145 --> 08:17.721
or why you're even here.

08:17.756 --> 08:20.348
Call it reporter's intuition,
but you were acting weird.

08:20.383 --> 08:21.891
I thought there was
more to the story.

08:21.927 --> 08:22.984
Now I am sure of it.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.736
<i>Get rid of him.</i>

08:24.771 --> 08:26.637
The targets are in range.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.748
Uh, you know what?
Let's talk later.

08:28.784 --> 08:30.467
This isn't really a safe place.

08:30.502 --> 08:33.669
Oh, so it's safe for you,
but not for me.

08:33.705 --> 08:35.505
Now I'm really intrigued.

08:35.540 --> 08:36.631
Okay, look out.

08:40.003 --> 08:41.511
Sweet dreams.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.433
Sorry, C-Dubs.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.552
I'll take that flash drive.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.061
Thank you very much.

09:07.097 --> 09:08.963
All right, C-Dubs.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.623
Let's roll.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.138
Okay, we'll go on
three, all right?

09:17.174 --> 09:19.882
One, two...

09:23.496 --> 09:26.147
Three.

09:26.182 --> 09:28.240
I said we go on three.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.992
That would be
the number after two.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.286
You should've listened to me.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.431
I told you not to
mess around with this interview.

09:34.466 --> 09:36.632
I told you,
I told you, I told you.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.243
Will you stop telling me
you told me

09:38.278 --> 09:39.235
and help me get him in here?

09:39.270 --> 09:41.529
Ready? On three.

09:41.564 --> 09:45.700
One, two, three.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.779
What? I said three.

09:49.814 --> 09:51.164
I know. You got
all up in my head.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.346
Just get in the van, please.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.629
Can you just admit for once

10:06.664 --> 10:08.590
you wouldn't be in
this situation

10:08.625 --> 10:10.333
if you had done
what I told you?!

10:10.368 --> 10:12.460
He wouldn't know you exist,

10:12.495 --> 10:13.461
and he definitely
wouldn't have followed you

10:13.496 --> 10:16.138
on your top-secret mission.

10:16.174 --> 10:17.048
Now, what do you suggest
we do with this guy

10:17.084 --> 10:19.317
when he wakes up?

10:42.926 --> 10:44.312
So up until I was,
I don't know, three years old,

10:44.336 --> 10:47.319
I thought it was A-B-Z's.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.664
Oh, man, kids can be so dumb.

10:49.699 --> 10:52.433
Even the really smart ones.

10:52.469 --> 10:55.220
Um... what are we doing here?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.071
Apparently putting you to sleep.

10:57.107 --> 10:59.432
Uh, no, no.

10:59.467 --> 11:01.250
No, wait, I followed you.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.277
No, you came up to me earlier

11:03.312 --> 11:04.957
and asked if we could
meet here for the interview

11:04.981 --> 11:07.332
and then you insisted on
getting the Hawaiian pizza,

11:07.367 --> 11:09.425
which you will pay
the price for later

11:09.460 --> 11:11.096
when it feels like you've been
slammed up against a van.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.631
It'll make sense, trust me.

11:14.666 --> 11:17.658
Uh, well, I don't remember
any of that,

11:17.694 --> 11:21.171
but I guess we should
start the interview.

11:21.206 --> 11:23.181
Or continue it.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.699
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.176
Ask away. I am an open book.

11:27.212 --> 11:29.562
I have no secrets whatsoever.

11:29.639 --> 11:32.231
So tell me, did you always
wanna be a journalist?

11:32.267 --> 11:35.676
Absolutely.

11:35.712 --> 11:39.114
When I was five, I did
my first investigative report.

11:39.190 --> 11:42.775
"Mall Santas: Lap of luxury
or knees of disease?"

11:42.811 --> 11:45.319
Mmm, interesting. Please go on.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.620
You should've seen it.
I played him like a fiddle.

11:53.655 --> 11:55.866
If there's one thing I learned
from being friends with you,

11:55.890 --> 11:57.693
it's that people
love to talk about themselves.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.968
So I managed to finish
the interview

12:00.003 --> 12:02.086
without giving up
any real information,

12:02.121 --> 12:04.363
and I still get
the recognition I deserve.

12:04.399 --> 12:05.481
Take that, Alexis.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.133
( Scoffs )

12:07.168 --> 12:10.027
Uh, I saw that.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.240
- Saw what?
- You rolled your eyes.

12:11.264 --> 12:15.775
Well, I had to roll them,
or else I would fall asleep.

12:15.852 --> 12:17.454
How many times are we gonna
talk about this Alexis

12:17.478 --> 12:20.195
and Who Cares quarterly?

12:20.231 --> 12:22.532
Could you not mock and criticize
me for once in your life?

12:22.567 --> 12:24.667
When have I ever criticized you?

12:24.703 --> 12:26.828
I don't know.
Our entire friendship.

12:26.905 --> 12:31.749
Where is the sparkly
unicorn vest I laid out for you?

12:31.784 --> 12:33.610
You cannot wear flannel
on Picture Day.

12:33.645 --> 12:36.529
Why? It never goes out of style.

12:36.565 --> 12:39.106
Because it's never been in style.
You can't wear that.

12:39.141 --> 12:42.277
Not only will I wear
flannel today.

12:42.312 --> 12:45.463
I will wear flannel every day
for the rest of my life.

12:45.499 --> 12:46.172
What about when you get married?

12:46.207 --> 12:49.534
Flannel veil.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.544
Oh, so you're blaming
your lack of style on me?

12:52.580 --> 12:54.233
- Is that what this is about?
- I'm stylish.

12:54.257 --> 12:56.958
Ish.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.993
Look, this is about you
supporting me,

12:59.029 --> 13:00.506
which apparently is just
too much to ask.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.538
- KC.
- I don't wanna fight.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.382
I'm just kind of stressed out

13:04.417 --> 13:05.552
because of this interview,
but you know what?

13:05.576 --> 13:07.918
At least it's over.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.645
KC, there you are.
I wanna set up a time

13:09.680 --> 13:11.022
to interview your parents.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.349
Uh, what do you mean by parents?

13:13.384 --> 13:17.078
I mean the people
who raised you.

13:17.113 --> 13:19.614
Oh, that's impossible,
'cause my dad's out of town.

13:19.649 --> 13:20.910
Then I can wait
till he gets back.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.917
He's an astronaut.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.421
It could be months.

13:26.456 --> 13:28.447
Then your mom.

13:28.482 --> 13:31.367
She has outta-house-aphobia.

13:31.402 --> 13:35.804
That is the fear of
being out of the house.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.633
Well, then, I will come to her.

13:38.668 --> 13:39.862
All right?
See you this afternoon.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.543
Okay.

13:41.579 --> 13:46.007
Outta-house-aphobia?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.842
How are you the smartest
person in our school?

13:51.789 --> 13:54.732
( Knocking on door )

13:54.767 --> 13:56.584
Hello. Anybody home?
Mrs. Cooper?

13:56.619 --> 13:58.536
- Hello.
- Coming.

14:02.267 --> 14:04.717
Hello, hello, hello.

14:04.752 --> 14:07.461
I am Kira Cooper, KC's mother.

14:07.497 --> 14:08.582
How ya feelin'?
What's the dealie?

14:08.606 --> 14:11.516
Whazzup?!

14:11.593 --> 14:14.318
Oh, I'm sorry. I know that
is old-timey expressions.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.202
How do you young kids
say it nowadays?

14:15.238 --> 14:17.529
Uh... hi.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.757
You kids and your crazy slang.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.501
Come on.

14:22.536 --> 14:24.946
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Cooper.

14:24.981 --> 14:26.714
And can I just say,
you look so young

14:26.749 --> 14:28.724
to have a teenage daughter.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.327
You know what?
The secret is clean living.

14:31.362 --> 14:33.721
And lots and lots
and lots of makeup.

14:33.756 --> 14:35.406
I mean, under here,
I am an old hag.

14:37.927 --> 14:38.250
So you're doing
a little article about my baby?

14:38.286 --> 14:39.994
Yes.

14:41.438 --> 14:43.689
Ernie!

14:43.724 --> 14:44.882
What are you doing here?

14:44.918 --> 14:47.844
I live here.

14:47.879 --> 14:50.846
Well, don't just stand there,
my son.

14:50.882 --> 14:53.382
Your what?!

14:53.417 --> 14:57.319
Give your mama some sugar.
Come here now.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.891
( Whispering ) I am this
close to getting my article.

14:58.915 --> 15:00.548
You better not
mess it up for me.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.109
Oh! Look at my little boy.

15:03.144 --> 15:04.760
All right, so where were we?

15:04.795 --> 15:06.929
We were waiting for KC.

15:06.965 --> 15:09.173
We don't have to wait
for her; She's boring.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.292
I think she should be here.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.386
Well, you know what?

15:13.421 --> 15:15.238
She's actually at NASA
waiting for her father.

15:15.273 --> 15:17.781
Could be months.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.251
Actually, Mother, KC is back.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.794
She's right upstairs.

15:21.829 --> 15:26.674
KC always has to be
right... upstairs.

15:26.709 --> 15:28.968
You're mistaken, dear.

15:29.003 --> 15:30.578
Don't forget,
you're still not too old

15:30.613 --> 15:32.330
to get a little spanking.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.365
Nope. She just texted me.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.236
Should I text her and tell her
to come on down?

15:36.260 --> 15:38.244
( Stammering ) You know what?

15:38.279 --> 15:40.254
That won't be necessary.
I will be right back.

15:40.289 --> 15:41.747
With KC?

15:41.782 --> 15:42.782
( Angrily ) Yes, with KC.

15:44.785 --> 15:47.461
I mean, you hope for
two geniuses,

15:47.496 --> 15:48.936
but this one
is just not that bright.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.581
KC's right upstairs.

15:58.616 --> 16:00.056
He is lucky
that I am not his mother.

16:11.621 --> 16:13.645
Oh, hey, C.W.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.655
My mom said you needed me.
What's up?

16:14.690 --> 16:15.873
I need both of you actually.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.017
Oh, well, she's upstairs,

16:18.052 --> 16:20.161
and I only have
a few minutes, you know.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.054
So much homework,
so little time.

16:22.090 --> 16:23.406
Go ahead. Ask away.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.716
Uh, okay.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.235
Would you say you inherited your
work ethic from your parents?

16:28.270 --> 16:30.370
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.583
My parents have always
encouraged me

16:31.607 --> 16:33.415
to be the best I can be.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.892
I'm sure my mom would agree.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.469
But why leave it to chance?

16:37.505 --> 16:41.482
Why not go get her?

16:41.517 --> 16:45.044
I'm sure it'll be nice for C.W. to
talk to both of you at the same time.

16:45.079 --> 16:47.655
Maybe even take a picture
of both of you.

16:47.690 --> 16:51.676
- Together.
- That would be great.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.461
Mmm, wouldn't it?
I'll be right back.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.217
¶ Mommy's home! ¶

17:02.721 --> 17:05.648
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

17:05.683 --> 17:07.975
I was at... plastic surgery.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.847
Which is why I look so young.

17:12.882 --> 17:14.857
But don't put that
in your article.

17:14.893 --> 17:16.317
That is off the record, mister.

17:18.530 --> 17:19.795
Who's this?

17:19.830 --> 17:21.947
Oh, I'm KC's mother.

17:25.403 --> 17:26.518
Then who's that?

17:26.554 --> 17:31.249
KC's other mother.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.884
KC has two moms?

17:33.920 --> 17:36.003
Looks like it.

17:44.054 --> 17:46.672
I didn't realize
KC had two moms.

17:46.707 --> 17:48.891
Neither did she.

17:51.387 --> 17:54.329
Well, it's not like when
I was a teenager.

17:54.365 --> 17:58.192
There's lots of ways to make
a family nowadays.

18:00.604 --> 18:02.538
Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

18:02.573 --> 18:04.281
This one is so pushy.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.054
One second.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.198
What the heck
do you think you're doing?

18:13.234 --> 18:14.270
Why would you come over here
and pretend to be my mother?

18:14.294 --> 18:18.012
You told me I don't support
you, so I came to support you.

18:18.047 --> 18:21.248
That's actually really sweet.
Thank you.

18:21.284 --> 18:23.084
Now get outta here
before you ruin everything.

18:24.945 --> 18:27.162
I'm sorry. Just to clarify,

18:27.197 --> 18:28.747
KC lives here with you two?

18:28.782 --> 18:30.608
- Her moms?
- Yeah, so?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.109
Just a little surprised.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.636
Why? 'Cause I'm white?

18:34.671 --> 18:37.114
No. No.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.941
Because my background
information says

18:38.976 --> 18:40.610
KC lives here
with her mom and her dad.

18:40.645 --> 18:43.045
A Craig Cooper?

18:43.081 --> 18:45.982
The guy that's in
all the family photos inside

18:46.017 --> 18:47.774
while you aren't in any of them.

18:47.810 --> 18:49.087
There's a simple explanation
for all of that.

18:49.111 --> 18:51.162
I'm a vampire.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.545
A vampire?

18:59.580 --> 19:02.890
You, a vampire?

19:02.925 --> 19:05.025
Well, I know
it's not as original

19:05.061 --> 19:07.611
as having outta-house-aphobia

19:07.647 --> 19:10.505
while your father
is stuck in space,

19:10.541 --> 19:13.584
but then again, I'm not
the smartest girl in school

19:13.619 --> 19:15.299
- like you.
- Just help me drag him inside.

19:20.668 --> 19:22.160
I can't believe it.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.570
You actually asked me
to help you with something.

19:24.605 --> 19:27.056
Excuse me, but what is
that supposed to mean?

19:27.091 --> 19:29.357
It means you never want
anyone's help

19:29.393 --> 19:29.942
because you have to have
everything your way.

19:29.977 --> 19:30.977
Exactly.

19:34.081 --> 19:36.081
- Why am I on the floor?
- Hey, let me help you up.

19:39.654 --> 19:41.971
Your problem is
you always have to be right.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.998
Now we're having a conversation.

19:44.033 --> 19:45.991
Why is everybody
ganging up on me?

19:46.026 --> 19:48.436
So you don't like that
we're challenging you?

19:48.471 --> 19:50.195
Probably because you're
not used to it

19:50.231 --> 19:52.072
because you always
have to be right.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.157
And you always
have to be the best...

19:54.193 --> 19:56.110
The best student,
the best athlete,

19:56.187 --> 19:58.404
- the best fake mom.
- Okay, guys, this is crazy.

19:58.481 --> 20:01.723
Is it? You couldn't let
Alexis be in the magazine

20:01.759 --> 20:03.128
because you couldn't stand
the idea of people thinking

20:03.152 --> 20:04.468
she's better than you.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.320
Because she's not.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.977
I have a teeny, tiny, slightly
higher GPA than she does.

20:13.012 --> 20:13.852
I don't always
have to be the best.

20:13.888 --> 20:15.404
It's just that...

20:15.439 --> 20:17.131
You usually are?

20:17.166 --> 20:18.766
Hey, you said it, I didn't.

20:18.801 --> 20:22.327
I really am confused.

20:22.363 --> 20:22.887
I don't know where all this
is suddenly coming from.

20:22.922 --> 20:27.466
- Suddenly?!
- This has been going on forever.

20:27.501 --> 20:30.610
KC, Marisa and I are
signing up for the talent show.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.579
Yeah. We've been practicing.

20:32.614 --> 20:34.006
Look what we can do.
Hit it, Ernie.

20:34.041 --> 20:38.936
( Playing "Chopsticks" off-key )

20:47.330 --> 20:49.170
That's great. I've been
practicing, too. May I?

20:55.579 --> 20:59.164
( Playing "Flight of
the Bumblebee" flawlessly )

21:09.276 --> 21:11.484
And that's how
you play the piano.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.447
I'm not having fun anymore.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.517
I'm never going to try to be
good at anything ever again.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.113
You know what?
I just realized something.

21:24.483 --> 21:26.341
I should've never
quit piano lessons.

21:26.377 --> 21:29.344
I was really good.

21:29.379 --> 21:31.121
That's not the point
of the story.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.407
Okay, fine.

21:33.442 --> 21:35.409
So sometimes I have
a little itty bitty

21:35.444 --> 21:37.178
overwhelming need to be
the absolute best

21:37.213 --> 21:39.513
at everything I do,

21:39.549 --> 21:41.284
but what's wrong with
wanting to be the best?

21:41.308 --> 21:44.076
Nothing, but it's also
not the end of the world

21:44.111 --> 21:47.646
if sometimes, somebody else is.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.275
So what? I'm just supposed
to dumb myself down?

21:49.299 --> 21:51.241
I'm not gonna do that.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.077
No, we wouldn't want you
to do that.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.771
But all of this
"failure isn't an option" stuff

21:55.806 --> 21:58.273
is really a lot of pressure.

21:58.309 --> 22:00.784
And when you're so focused on
beating everyone around you...

22:00.820 --> 22:03.545
Then I lose sight
of what's really important.

22:03.580 --> 22:06.615
Like the fact that I have
an amazing brother

22:06.617 --> 22:09.376
and best friend who are
actually very, very right.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.779
I'm sorry, guys,
and I will work on it.

22:11.814 --> 22:13.655
Okay? I promise.

22:13.691 --> 22:14.581
Now can we go get some fro-yo?

22:14.617 --> 22:16.675
Sounds good.

22:16.711 --> 22:19.244
Ooh, better not forget this.

22:38.149 --> 22:43.269
Ooh. Enjoying the article

22:43.304 --> 22:45.312
Yes, actually.

22:45.348 --> 22:47.005

22:53.989 --> 22:55.865

22:55.900 --> 22:57.574
A little bit.
