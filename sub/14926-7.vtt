00:05.539 --> 00:06.174
Walt: YEAH.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.242
OH. GOOD, GOOD,

00:08.276 --> 00:09.043
DAD! THE CHAIR!

00:09.077 --> 00:10.778
OH. THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR LUCKY CHAIR.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.446
I FORGOT.
I LOST MY HEAD.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.083
WHOO! HA HA.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.285
DAD. YOUR SHIRT'S
ON INSIDE-OUT.

00:17.318 --> 00:20.088
YEAH. YEAH.
IT'S FOR THE KNICKS.
IT HELPS 'EM WIN.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.189
HOW?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.623
IT'S INSIDE-OUT.
IT'S LUCKY.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.158
HOW DO YOU THINK
THEY MADE THE PLAY

00:24.192 --> 00:27.661
I THINK MY UNDERPANTS
ARE ON INSIDE OUT.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.598
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!
YEAH! ALL RIGHT!

00:33.167 --> 00:33.801
HEY, ED.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.403

00:35.436 --> 00:36.804
YEAH. HEY.
WAIT A MINUTE, MAN.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.406
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BRING THE BEER.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.107
OH. I DID.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.608
OK. YOU KNOW,
THE FUNNY THING

00:40.641 --> 00:43.411
ABOUT THE WORD "BEER" IS
THAT IT CAN MEAN MANY.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.279
OR JUST ONE.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.315
GO HEAT!

00:47.348 --> 00:48.816
AW! GEE. COME ON.
NO WAY, MAN.

00:48.849 --> 00:49.717
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE SITTIN' HERE

00:49.750 --> 00:51.685
ROOTIN' FOR THE HEAT
IN THIS HOUSE TONIGHT.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.087
I HAPPEN TO LIKE THE HEAT.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.689
OH. YEAH. NAME ONE
OF THEIR PLAYERS.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.524
NUMBER 30.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.093
DUDE, YOU'RE PATHETIC.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.128
WHERE'S CLAUDIA?

01:00.161 --> 01:01.762
SHE, UH, WENT TO JERSEY
WITH LILY FOR THE WEEKEND.

01:01.795 --> 01:02.596
THEY'RE GOING
TO THE OUTLET MALLS.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.432
I WISH THEY'D TOLD ME.
I NEED V-NECKS.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.866
WELL. THEY'RE NOT REALLY
GOING TO THE MALLS TO SHOP.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.536
YOU KNOW, CLAUDIA JUST FELT
THAT THEY SHOULD BE
SPENDING TIME TOGETHER.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.439
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
TO SPEND TIME ALONE
WITH LILY.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.207
WE'RE NOT CLOSE ANYMORE.

01:13.241 --> 01:16.644
REMEMBER WHEN WE USED
TO BE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS?

01:16.677 --> 01:20.281
MOMMY? WE'RE GONNA BE
THE BESTEST FRIENDS FOREVER.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.815
THAT'S RIGHT, SWEETIE.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.684
MOMMY. WILL YOU MARRY ME?

01:23.717 --> 01:27.588
WHY DON'T
WE JUST LIVE TOGETHER?

01:27.621 --> 01:29.523
YOU TWO ARE STILL CLOSE.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.460
I MEAN,
NOT MARRYING CLOSE,
BUT CLOSE.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.494
YOU ARE CLUELESS.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.828
LILY AND I MIGHT AS WELL
LIVE ON DIFFERENT PLANETS.

01:34.862 --> 01:41.635
AND I REALIZED MY FATHER
NEVER REALLY TOLD ME
HOW HE FELT ABOUT IT.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.437
THAT WAS THE FIRST
AND ONLY TIME

01:43.471 --> 01:45.673
I'VE EVER SEEN HIM CRY.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.508
OH, MY GOD.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.343
MY LIPS ARE FAT!

01:49.377 --> 01:50.644
DO MY LIPS LOOK FAT?

01:50.678 --> 01:53.381
YOU DON'T HAVE
FAT LIPS.

01:53.414 --> 01:57.251
WHY DO I HAVE
TO HAVE FAT LIPS?

01:57.285 --> 01:59.320
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

01:59.353 --> 02:00.754
WELL. OF COURSE, HONEY.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.157
I MEAN, MICHELLE'S HAVING
THAT BIG PARTY TONIGHT.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.826
I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE EVEN REALLY
WANTS ME TO COME.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.461
WHY WOULDN'T SHE
WANT YOU TO COME?

02:07.495 --> 02:09.530
YOU'RE GREAT.
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.632
YEAH...

02:11.665 --> 02:15.303
BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO WEAR ANYWAY.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.671
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU COULD WEAR
THAT PINK TANK TOP

02:17.705 --> 02:18.939
WITH THE LITTLE
RHINESTONES--

02:18.972 --> 02:21.909
MOM! I'M ON THE PHONE.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.547
SO, YOU REALLY THINK
THIS WEEKEND IN NEW JERSEY
IS GONNA HELP THINGS?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.582
MMM. A TRIP TO HAWAII
WOULD BE BETTER,

02:28.616 --> 02:31.252
BUT WE CAN
AFFORD JERSEY.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.726
Claudia: HEY.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.566
GODSPEED.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.202
OH. MAKE SURE
SATAN BELTS UP.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.239
YEAH!

02:51.272 --> 02:52.005
SO, THE GIRLS
ARE GONNA
GO DOWN THERE,

02:52.039 --> 02:53.707
DO A LITTLE
SHOPPING,
YOU KNOW,

02:53.741 --> 02:54.508
CHECK INTO A HOTEL,

02:54.542 --> 02:56.510
ORDER ROOM SERVICE
IN THEIR PAJAMAS,

02:56.544 --> 02:57.945
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER GIRLS
LIKE TO DO.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.280
YEAH. GO TO THE BATHROOM
TOGETHER,

02:59.313 --> 03:00.981
TRY ON EACH OTHER'S
UNDERWEAR.

03:01.014 --> 03:01.882
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.785
ALL RIGHT, CAMBY!
WAY TO SWAT THAT THING!

03:04.818 --> 03:06.687
Eddie: YEAH.

GO! GO!

03:08.289 --> 03:09.056
HEY, DAD.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.424
HEY, LILY. YOU GUYS
ARE HOME EARLY.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.759
NOT MOM. JUST ME.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.993
WHAT?
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

03:13.026 --> 03:16.797
BACK IN NEW JERSEY
WHERE SHE RUINED MY LIFE.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.633
OH. I NEED $150.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.768
WHY?

03:20.801 --> 03:21.569
THE CAB.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.272
YOU TOOK A CAB BACK
FROM NEW JERSEY?

03:25.273 --> 03:26.940
HE'S WAITING.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.958
EDDIE. WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU GET $150 CASH?

03:44.992 --> 03:47.995
WELL. I DON'T ASK YOU
WHERE YOU GET YOUR MONEY.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.797
I GOT A JOB.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.799
I DIDN'T ASK.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.033
WHAT DID YOU DO

03:53.066 --> 03:54.034
WITH MY MOTHER?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.703
Sean: OH. HENRY.
HENRY. IT'S OK.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.737
LILY. WHERE'S MOM?

03:56.770 --> 03:59.373
WHY ARE YOU
SO WORRIED ABOUT HER?
SHE HAS A CAR.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.609
I'M THE ONE
WHO WAS FORCED
TO TAKE A CAB.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.043
HEY. NO ONE FORCED YOU
TO TAKE A CAB.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.613
HEY. I DIDN'T ASK
TO BE BORN.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.547
OH. HEY. WHOA.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.049
LILY. LILY. COME ON.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.285
YOU TWO WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HAVING FUN.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.722
WE DID HAVE FUN.
AT FIRST.

04:16.857 --> 04:17.891
COME ON OUT, LIL.

04:17.925 --> 04:18.892
I LOOK STUPID.

04:18.926 --> 04:22.930
I'M SURE YOU DON'T.
COME ON.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.836
WHOA.

04:28.869 --> 04:29.803
WHAT?

04:29.837 --> 04:30.971
LOOK AT YOU.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.039
SHUT UP.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.441
NO. YOU LOOK HOT.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.676
REALLY?
YES.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.711
CAN I GET IT?
NO.

04:37.745 --> 04:38.879
WHY NOT?

04:38.912 --> 04:41.081
YOU LOOK HOT.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.452
OK. GET IT.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.453
SWEET.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.455
BUT YOU'RE GETTING
A HUGE SWEATER
TO GO OVER IT.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.790
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU HAVE ANYTHING

04:49.823 --> 04:50.524
TO WORRY ABOUT, MOM.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.793
BOYS DON'T EVEN
NOTICE I EXIST.

04:52.826 --> 04:53.994
OH. YOU'RE BEING
RIDICULOUS.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.095
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
UNZIP ME.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.999
FINE. YEAH. RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY I'M 15,
AND I HAVEN'T...

04:59.032 --> 05:00.734
YOU KNOW.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.836
YOU HAVEN'T?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.672
YOU KNOW.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.940
HAD SEX?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.478
YEAH.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.079
OK. BEING A VIRGIN
IS NOT A BAD THING.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.349
IT'S A GOOD THING.
A VERY GOOD THING.
IT'S A GREAT THING.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.884
YEAH. YEAH.

05:16.917 --> 05:20.754
BELIEVE ME. I KNOW.
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

05:20.788 --> 05:21.989
HOW OLD WERE YOU,
MOM?

05:22.022 --> 05:24.892
WE'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT ME.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.126
HOW OLD?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.962
MISS? DO--DO YOU
HAVE THIS IN GREEN?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.598
YOU WERE 15,
WEREN'T YA?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.633
LOOK AT THOSE SOCKS.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.334
MOM!

05:34.768 --> 05:37.004
AND SHE COMPLETELY
AVOIDED THE QUESTION.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.473
LILY. I'M VERY, VERY PLEASED
YOU'RE STILL A VIRGIN.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.542
DAD. THAT IS SO
NOT THE POINT.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.911
AH. IT WOULD BE
IF YOU WEREN'T.

05:43.944 --> 05:44.812
YOU'RE AS BAD AS MOM.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.680
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.849
OK. OK. I'M SORRY.
ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.418
OK. SO, WE GOT
TO OUR HOTEL,

05:50.451 --> 05:53.587
AND I RAN INTO
SOME FRIENDS OF MINE
FROM SCHOOL.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.523
REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.891
WHAT'S YOUR NAME
AGAIN

05:57.925 --> 05:58.826
LILY.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.760
AREN'T YOU

05:59.793 --> 06:03.030
YEAH. YEAH. YOU GUYS

06:08.902 --> 06:11.839
WELL. YOU KINDA

06:11.872 --> 06:12.906
OH.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.976
HEY, DID YOU GUYS
HAVE SISTER CATHERINE
LAST YEAR?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.210
YEAH. WHAT A COW.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.013
OH. I HEARD HER SCREAMING
THROUGH THE HALLWAYS
THE OTHER DAY.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.482
I MADE HER DO THAT.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.616
SHE FELL ASLEEP
AT HER DESK,

06:22.650 --> 06:26.019
AND I STAPLED
HER VEIL TO A CHAIR.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.827

IN THE FIRST PLACE. WOW.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.712
SURE. TAKE HER SIDE.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.479

07:38.526 --> 07:39.493

07:39.527 --> 07:41.094
WHO LOVES THE HEAT
MORE THAN ME?

07:41.128 --> 07:41.862
UH, HEAT FANS.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.964
WHY DO YOU LIKE
THE HEAT SO MUCH?

07:43.997 --> 07:47.501
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY SPEAK TO ME.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.569
OH. YOU KNOW?
YOU KNOW WHY?

07:48.602 --> 07:49.903

THESE ARE THE COOL PEOPLE.

08:09.890 --> 08:10.958
IF I COULD BE
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM,

08:10.991 --> 08:13.761
I'D BE SET FOR
THE REST OF HIGH SCHOOL.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.863
HIGH SCHOOL BOYS

08:15.896 --> 08:16.797
DORKS.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.131
LAME-OHS.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.932
WHY WOULDN'T THEY BUY IT?
I'M MATURE.

08:51.965 --> 08:52.766
OH. YOU KNOW,
THAT'S IT.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.567
I MEAN, I JUST THINK
YOU'RE SO MATURE.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.102

OR A LAWYER

08:57.070 --> 09:00.040

OR--OR A BARON.

09:00.073 --> 09:00.874

09:06.446 --> 09:09.182
OK. OK. I DON'T CARE
IF YOU BUY IT.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.284

WHAT ELSE CAN WE ORDER?

09:12.886 --> 09:13.887

I DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK
THAT I EAT ONION RINGS.

09:15.923 --> 09:16.924
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT WE ORDER.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.359
WHAT MATTERS
IS GETTING THAT WAITER
BACK UP HERE.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.293

11:29.522 --> 11:30.423
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY GIRLS

11:30.457 --> 11:31.491

11:31.524 --> 11:34.327

11:34.361 --> 11:35.228

11:35.262 --> 11:37.998
IT'S NOT COOL.
MOM WAS STEALING MY FRIENDS.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.834
I WAS IN THE SPOTLIGHT,
AND SHE GRABBED IT
AWAY FROM ME.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.070
NO. NO. SHE DID NOT GRAB
THE SPOTLIGHT FROM YOU.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.238
SHE JUST SHINED IT
ON SOME HOTEL
DUDE'S BUTT.

11:45.272 --> 11:50.077

11:50.277 --> 11:54.848
OH! OH! HEAT! OH! OHH.

11:54.882 --> 11:55.715
SO, HOW'S LILY?

11:55.749 --> 11:57.517
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S HARD

11:57.550 --> 11:59.853
YEAH. WELL. SHE'S LUCKY
TO HAVE A FATHER

11:59.887 --> 12:01.188

12:24.744 --> 12:26.179

DUTCH SETTLERS IN MANHATTAN,

12:39.392 --> 12:42.262
AND THEY WERE COOL
BECAUSE, UM...

12:42.295 --> 12:44.231
UH, UH, THEY SWINDLED
THE INDIANS.

12:44.264 --> 12:44.998
Sean: YEAH.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.534

12:56.276 --> 12:59.146
AH. NO. YOU DIDN'T, HENRY.
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
SHUT UP, EDDIE.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.117
WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

13:04.151 --> 13:06.486
UH, UH, SHE'S HERE.
SHE'S SAFE.

13:06.519 --> 13:10.858
NO. SHE'S NOT SAFE.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.833
ALL RIGHT, JIMMY.
UH, IT'S YOUR BEDTIME.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.035
WHY DOESN'T HENRY
HAVE TO GO TO BED?

13:22.069 --> 13:24.037
HE'S...YOUNGER.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.939
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.242
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
HE'S ROOTIN'
FOR THE KNICKS, OK?

13:29.276 --> 13:30.978
WELL, JIMMY.
YOU KNOW
WHAT THE HEAT HAS

13:31.011 --> 13:32.612
THAT THE KNICKS

13:32.645 --> 13:35.883
I'LL TELL YOU.
IT'S CLASS.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.019
LOOK AT PAT RILEY.
LOOK AT HIS HAIR.

13:39.052 --> 13:39.920
THAT'S CLASS HAIR.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.622
NO, NO, KNICKS...
THE KNICKS HAVE HISTORY.

13:42.655 --> 13:47.060
LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO
THE 8th OF MAY, 1970...

13:47.094 --> 13:49.029
GAME 7 OF
THE NBA FINALS

13:49.062 --> 13:52.132
AGAINST WILT CHAMBERLAIN

LOS ANGELES LAKERS,

13:52.165 --> 13:54.935
AND THE MADISON
SQUARE GARDEN FAITHFUL

13:54.968 --> 13:57.537
BUT THEY KNOW
THEY JUST HAVE
A THIN SHRED OF HOPE

13:57.570 --> 13:59.072
BECAUSE WILLIS REED
IS OUT.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.173
CHAMBERLAIN LAUGHS.
"HA HA HA HA.

14:00.207 --> 14:04.044
I CAN SCORE 100 POINTS
IN A GAME. NO REED.
HA HA HA."

14:04.077 --> 14:05.245
THE LAUGH OF CONFIDENCE
THAT ONLY A MAN

14:05.278 --> 14:08.148
WHO SLEPT WITH
25,000 WOMEN CAN HAVE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

14:08.181 --> 14:12.319
BUT WAIT! WHO'S

THE KNICKS LOCKER ROOM?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.989

14:20.060 --> 14:22.662
AND THERE'S CHAMBERLAIN.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.899
AND IT'S
THE GREATEST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.335
THAT WAS 1970.
YOU WERE 2.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.271
OH, YEAH.
WELL, ME AND DAD
SAW THE HIGHLIGHTS

14:31.304 --> 14:32.906
ON SPORTS CENTER
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.542
OH. HEY.
YOU GUYS STRAIGHTEN
ANYTHING OUT?

14:35.575 --> 14:38.078
SHE SAW ME COMING,
LOCKED HERSELF
IN THE BATHROOM,

14:38.111 --> 14:39.012
AND TURNED ON
THE BLOW DRYER.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.548
OH, OH, BLOW DRYER.
THAT COULD TAKE A WHILE.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.415
SHE THINKS
SHE CAN WAIT ME OUT.

14:42.449 --> 14:46.053
NO WAY. I TOOK HER
ON THIS NICE WEEKEND.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.154
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE SPECIAL.

14:47.187 --> 14:51.591
HOW DID SHE REWARD ME?
SHE ABANDONED ME.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.145
SO, CAN I BUY YOU
A DRINK?

15:12.179 --> 15:14.414
OH. NO, THANKS.
I HAVE ONE.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.984
YOU'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.087
THANK YOU.
THAT'S NICE.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.057
OH, OK. LOOK, UM...

15:24.091 --> 15:26.359
I'VE OBVIOUSLY NEVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE,

15:26.393 --> 15:28.061
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD TELL ME...

15:28.095 --> 15:30.063
how to go about it.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.132
Go about what?

15:32.165 --> 15:36.103
WELL, UH, COME ON,

15:36.136 --> 15:39.006

15:49.549 --> 15:51.184
I'M LEAVING!

15:51.218 --> 15:54.154
HOW MUCH YOU THINK
YOU COULD HAVE CHARGED HIM?

15:55.222 --> 15:57.157
I'M GONNA START
CHARGING YOU.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.358
IT WAS DISGUSTING.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.560
COULDN'T YOU FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO?

16:00.593 --> 16:03.263
I DIDN'T WANT
TO FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.497
I WANTED
TO BE WITH LILY.

16:04.531 --> 16:08.335
OH, OK. SO YOU SEDUCED
THE ROOM SERVICE GUY.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.670
SHE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT, HUH?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.772
MM-HMM.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKIN'?

16:12.805 --> 16:16.743
OH. I WAS THINKING
IF HER FRIENDS
THOUGHT I WAS COOL,

16:16.776 --> 16:18.145
MAYBE SHE WOULD, TOO.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.048
JUST BECAUSE HE'S ON
THE LACROSSE TEAM

16:21.081 --> 16:22.082
HE THINKS
HE OWNS ME.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.117
MMM. HE IS SUCH
A CREEP.
MMM.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.785
DO GUYS EVER CHANGE?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.154
WELL, THEY GET HEAVIER.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.789
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, LILY?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.192
I THINK IT'S REALLY
HOT IN HERE.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.362
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.
MY HAIR'S STARTING
TO FRIZZ UP A LITTLE.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.299
COME ON.
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
THE GUY AT RUTGERS.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.402
OH, MY GOD.
THE GUY AT RUTGERS.
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

16:42.435 --> 16:46.106
UH, CAN WE GO? MY SKIN'S
TURNING TO LEATHER.

16:46.139 --> 16:50.210
DONNY. DONNY FRANCIS.
HE PLAYED CLARINET
AT BAND CAMP.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.478
NO. NO. NO.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.681
SO, YOUR COLLEGE GUY
WENT TO BAND CAMP?

16:54.714 --> 16:58.585
COLLEGE? NO. NO, NO.
HE WAS 13.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.152
MOM.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.653
Mia: WE KNEW YOU WEREN'T

17:00.687 --> 17:02.189
DOING SOME COLLEGE GUY.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.090
YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR.

17:03.123 --> 17:07.360
HEY. YOU CAN BELIEVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT, OK?

17:07.394 --> 17:08.828
UH-HUH. YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.098
YOU KNOW, SHE IS COOL
WITH WHO SHE IS,

17:11.131 --> 17:14.301
AND LILY IS PROUD
TO BE A VIRGIN.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.238
LILY. WAIT.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.272
LYING FRESHMAN.

17:19.306 --> 17:23.610
CHEERLEADING BITCHES!
UNH! LILY!

17:23.643 --> 17:24.744
YOU OUTED HER?

17:24.777 --> 17:27.480
I DIDN'T MEAN TO. I...

17:27.514 --> 17:29.816
I TRIED TO FIND HER
TO APOLOGIZE,

17:29.849 --> 17:31.184
BUT SHE WASN'T ANYWHERE,

17:31.218 --> 17:33.820
SO I JUST WENT BACK
TO THE ROOM.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.223
LILY?

17:38.158 --> 17:40.260
HONEY, IS THAT YOU?

17:41.228 --> 17:44.164
I'M REALLY, REALLY
SORRY, SWEETIE.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.599
I TOTALLY
MISUNDERSTOOD
THE SITUATION,

17:46.633 --> 17:48.235
WHICH, IF YOU
THINK ABOUT IT,

17:48.268 --> 17:50.437
IS REALLY
KIND OF FUNNY.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.305
RIGHT, LIL?

17:54.141 --> 17:55.408
LILY.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.778
WHERE'S THE SUITCASE?

18:00.347 --> 18:03.116
SHE TOOK THE SUITCASE!

18:07.287 --> 18:08.020
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.422
HEY, HEY, I REALLY
LIKE YOUR ROBE.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.723
YEAH.
CAN I BUY YOU
A DRINK?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.225
NO DRINKS.
MISS. MISS.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.294
THE--THE BATHROBE
IS PROPERTY OF THE HOTEL.

18:14.327 --> 18:18.131
YEAH. GOOD TO KNOW.
YO! VALET!

18:21.168 --> 18:21.934
30 BUCKS.

18:21.968 --> 18:25.772
I'M SOR--I DON'T HAVE
MY PURSE. I--

18:26.239 --> 18:30.810
UM. I CAN PROBABLY
FIND SOME CHANGE
OR S-SOMETHING.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.345
HOLD ON.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.614
I'M SORRY.
