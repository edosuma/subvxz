of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:11.440 --> 00:14.091
<i>I fight crime

00:14.760 --> 00:17.525
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

00:17.680 --> 00:19.728
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

00:19.880 --> 00:21.882
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

00:22.280 --> 00:23.645
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

00:23.960 --> 00:26.770

00:42.520 --> 00:45.000

<i>HARRISON: Why is Savitar hiding
in the Speed Force?</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:49.569
- That's where the future you trapped him.
-That's right.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.485
I have what I need
to escape my hell, Wallace.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.120
Not everything,
we still have a piece of that Stone.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.209
It's gone?
If Savitar gets a hold of the Stone--

00:57.360 --> 00:58.361
He'll escape for sure.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.921
You cannot get rid of that Stone, Wallace.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.045
You're not fast enough to throw it
into the Speed Force by yourself!

My fear's the reason for all of this.

<i>BARRY: Savitar was right.
This is all because of me,</i>

01:24.400 --> 01:27.609

<i>And because of it,

<i>Everyone I love is suffering.</i>

Never again.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.281
Cisco,

01:48.320 --> 01:49.890
get the breach room ready.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.283
Okay, for what?

01:53.360 --> 01:54.885
I'm gonna save Wally.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.561
How exactly are you gonna do that?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.329
I'm going back into the Speed Force.

02:06.040 --> 02:09.806
I'm just trying to wrap my mind around
you going into the Speed Force again.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.204
Savitar said he was there for years.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.290
- You said it was like being in space.
-I know.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.169
So what are you gonna do?
You're gonna run in there

02:17.360 --> 02:18.850
and run around till you find him?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.809
- It's endless
-I know.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.169
- And this is the only way to save Wally.
-Yeah, yeah, just...

02:24.400 --> 02:26.164
We need a plan. l...

02:27.680 --> 02:29.330
I don't wanna lose both of my sons.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.207
Look,gang,
I don't understand the Speed Force,

02:32.360 --> 02:35.409
but there are plenty of people
in this room who do.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.642
Am I correct in assuming
there's a point coming?

02:37.840 --> 02:40.241
My point is,
why can't you use your knowledge

02:40.400 --> 02:43.210
to fashion some kind of safety precaution
for young B.A. right here,

02:43.360 --> 02:46.091
so that while he's in the Speed Force,
he doesn't get lost?

02:46.400 --> 02:49.882
So you're saying I can just whip up
some kind of inter-dimensional tether

02:50.040 --> 02:51.610
to just anchor him to the universe?

02:52.080 --> 02:53.081
Yeah.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.966
- That's exactly what I can do.
-Yeah!

02:56.120 --> 02:57.451
Now we're cooking with helium.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.728
<i>Yes, and I can add a biological component</i>

02:59.920 --> 03:01.604
that will measure his vitals
when he's in the Speed Force.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.649
- That's a great idea.
-Thank you, Caitlin.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.370
Because if we can monitor Barry's vitals,

03:05.520 --> 03:07.648
we'll know if they fluctuate,
and we can pull him out.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.086
You mean, pull us out.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.842
Yeah, if you're going in there
to save Wally, so am I.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.286
Jesse, you're gonna stay here.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.444
Because if your father finds out
you're lost in some negative world,

03:16.600 --> 03:19.126
the first person to get
a broken schnoz is me.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.163
- Did you say, "Negative world"?
-A negative world.

03:21.720 --> 03:22.721
Really?

03:22.880 --> 03:24.723
- They have Super Mario on Earth-19?
-Yeah. Challenge me.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.242
Barry, you need my help.
Your shoulder is still broken.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.129
It's okay. It's almost healed.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.248
- No, look, I can do this.
-I know.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.609
But I need you to stay here,
keep this city safe while I'm gone.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.328
And this is something
I have to do alone, okay?

03:40.080 --> 03:41.605
- Fine.
-Thank you.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.649
Okay, let's get to work.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.921
Can I talk to you?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.126
Yeah.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.051
I'm gonna find Wally.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.247
Whatever's holding him,
Whatever's keeping him trapped in there,

04:00.400 --> 04:01.606
I'm gonna get him back.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.121
Okay.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.521
Okay.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.081
Iris,

04:13.800 --> 04:14.801

04:30.120 --> 04:31.121
What's going on?

04:31.280 --> 04:36.730
Nothing, nothing. I'm just trying
to make her not worry so much.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.651
About Wally or you?

04:40.640 --> 04:42.210
Joe, now is not the time, all right?

04:42.360 --> 04:46.206
Look, you are about to risk your life

04:46.400 --> 04:48.050
<i>to save her brother.</i>

04:48.360 --> 04:51.887
I think now is the perfect time.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.210
She's having doubts about us,

04:56.640 --> 04:58.051
about marrying me.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.004
Did she call off the engagement?

05:01.320 --> 05:03.641
Guess I changed the future
one too many times.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.005
I think that's gonna do it.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.487
We should be able to use this
to keep track of Barry's vitals.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.529
He'll play astronaut,
and we'll play Houston.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.042
Right, but how exactly are you gonna track
his location when he's in the Speed Force?

05:17.200 --> 05:19.043
Well, this is just a simple modification

05:19.200 --> 05:21.089
from what we used
to get Barry out last time, so...

05:21.800 --> 05:23.404
The electrode halo?

05:23.600 --> 05:25.409
- Julian wasn't part of the team last time.
-Not yet.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.688
Oh, right. You know that thing
we used to talk to Savitar?

05:27.840 --> 05:28.921
<i>Yes.</i>

05:29.960 --> 05:31.450
Meet the electrode halo.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.287
So, basically, these two are linked
electromagnetically via Goldtooth.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.601
<i>“Sawtooth”?</i>

05:36.760 --> 05:40.765
Yeah, it's kind of the Cisco Ramon
inter-dimensional equivalent of Bluetooth.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.921
Kind of proud of it.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.481
Anyway, it gives us
all the relevant locus information,

05:44.680 --> 05:46.409
no matter what corner
of the multi-verse Barry's stuck in.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.291
And if Barry needs our help,
it'll stimulate Cisco's prefrontal cortex.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.442
And I'll open a breach
and suck him back in.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.291
Good Lord! Multi-verses, breaches, halos!

05:54.800 --> 05:56.086
Easy-bloody-peasy.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.523
By George, I think he's got it.

BARRY: (OVER INTERCOM)
Cisco, you about ready?

06:00.800 --> 06:01.926
Born ready.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.806
Okay.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.691
Here's to winging it.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.931
"Winging it"? Wait. What do you mean?

06:11.080 --> 06:13.651
Well, I mean, I don't really have a map
of the Speed Force,

06:13.800 --> 06:14.847
so when I vibe Barry into it--

06:15.040 --> 06:16.280
You have no idea where I'm gonna land.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.131
But the good news is, if he gets stuck
on the wrong side of the tracks,

06:19.280 --> 06:20.611
now we can fish him out.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.006
Find my boy.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.090
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.204
Ever the hero, huh, Barry?

It's my fault that he's trapped here.

It means, things have changed.

We gave you your speed back

09:41.800 --> 09:44.804
because you said you'd come to terms
with your mother's death.

- You went back in time and saved her.

any more choices like that.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.089
I know what my hell is.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.647
I've already seen it in the future.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.207
You don't like the future, Flash,
changeit

25:32.360 --> 25:36.285
I can't! Don't you get it? I can't.
I'm not fast enough. He is!

25:38.520 --> 25:39.521
(SIGHS)

25:40.840 --> 25:43.161
That's why you have
to let me take his place.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.450
Wally can save Iris.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.243
You're not learning your lesson, Barry.

25:50.440 --> 25:53.171
You keep telling us one thing
and then doing another.

25:55.800 --> 25:59.441
You wanna know what inspired Leonard Snart
to sacrifice himself?

25:59.920 --> 26:02.651
It was you, Barry Allen.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.488
You inspired him to be better.

26:06.800 --> 26:11.169
You inspired him to be selfless,
to sacrifice himself for others,

26:11.360 --> 26:14.967
to be a hero just like you.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.730
I'm no hero, not lately.

26:19.480 --> 26:20.970
So, what,

26:21.680 --> 26:24.001
had enough, Scarlet Speedster?

26:24.880 --> 26:27.326
Time to hang up the cowl
and give it all up?

26:27.960 --> 26:29.291
Well, if you're out...

26:30.320 --> 26:31.367
(WEAPON BUZZES)

26:31.520 --> 26:32.806
...you're out.

26:33.160 --> 26:37.051
- I'm done fighting.
-We know, and that's exactly the problem.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.366
You think seeing Iris' death is hell?

26:44.600 --> 26:46.523
You ain't seen nothing yet.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.805
(THUD5)

26:51.720 --> 26:53.210
Let's get you out of here.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.049
Okay, you stupid piece of metal,

27:07.560 --> 27:09.050
take me to your leader.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.486
Gotcha!

27:36.920 --> 27:41.369
Jesse Quick, I knew you would come for me.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.161
How'd you know I was coming here?

27:50.320 --> 27:54.644
Because I know everything that happens.
I've already lived it.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.491
- I'm not afraid of you.
-You should be.

Jesse.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.726
H.R.?

28:12.120 --> 28:13.690
It's a little late to talk me
out of this, okay?

28:13.840 --> 28:16.161
I'm not gonna try and talk you out
of anything. I learned that lesson.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.563
You have something that belongs to me!

28:19.800 --> 28:20.801
(STRAINING)

28:24.640 --> 28:26.165
I need a little help here, H.R.!

28:26.400 --> 28:28.243
- I'm thinking.
-Think faster!

28:28.400 --> 28:30.971
What have we got? We're fighting Savitar.
Savitar's a speed god.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.889
<i>He's omnipotent. He's invulnerable.</i>

28:33.040 --> 28:35.441
Then why does he need a suit of armor?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.443
<i>Jesse, he's vulnerable
somewhere under the suit!</i>

28:37.600 --> 28:39.409
Find a gap, find an opening,
and go for it!

28:40.960 --> 28:44.851
I have such plans for you in the future,
Jesse Quick.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.969
Well, I have plans for you, too.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.731
This is for Wally!

28:48.880 --> 28:49.927
(SCREAMS)

28:50.120 --> 28:51.121
Yeah!

29:05.320 --> 29:06.526
- Jay.
-Yeah?

29:07.280 --> 29:09.681
Is this really you,

29:09.840 --> 29:13.162
or is this just another Speed Force test?

29:14.120 --> 29:16.487
Yeah, kid, it's really me.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.286
How?

29:19.560 --> 29:21.369
As soon as the team lost contact with you,

29:21.520 --> 29:23.648
Cisco came to my Earth and told me
what was happening.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.126
<i>I came hereto help.</i>

in your golden age there, Garrick.</i>

29:34.040 --> 29:35.849
- Stop!
-Can't do that, either.

29:48.880 --> 29:49.927
Enough!

29:50.600 --> 29:51.647
I'm taking Wally.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.569
We can't let you do that, Barry.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.522
Yeah? Try and stop me.

30:05.720 --> 30:06.721
Wally?

30:08.160 --> 30:10.208
(MACHINES BEEPING)

30:10.360 --> 30:11.361
Hey-

Wally?

Barry? Jay?

30:21.160 --> 30:22.161
(CRYING)

30:22.600 --> 30:24.250
- I saw my mom.
-I know.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.961
- I know. Look at me.
-My mom's--

30:26.120 --> 30:28.202
I know. Look at me now, okay?

30:28.600 --> 30:29.806
It's over.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.880
You're free now.

30:32.720 --> 30:33.960
Okay? We're going home.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.005
All right? It's okay.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.603
We're going home.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.767
Jay, let's go.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.686
Sorry, kid.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.849
This is where I stay for a while.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.001
What?

30:54.280 --> 30:55.441
What are you talking about?

30:55.640 --> 31:00.168
We both know that a speedster
needs to take Wally's place.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.122
- That's why I'm here.
-No.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.850
No, Jay, you already lived your hell
when you were Zoom's prisoner.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.401
And you set me free,
and I owe you for that.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.528
_Jay__
-I've run a hell of a race,

31:13.280 --> 31:15.362
but every marathon has a finish line.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.284
Time has finally come for me to cross it,
but you...

31:20.760 --> 31:21.966
You, Barry,

31:23.240 --> 31:27.131
need to put an end to this
once and for all and stop Savitar.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.041
How?

31:34.200 --> 31:35.804
Do what you do best.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.086
Be the Flash.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.568
Cisco said that he could use this
to track you

31:48.000 --> 31:49.365
and bring you home.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.529
I'm gonna get this back to you again

31:59.000 --> 32:00.604
when I break you out of here.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.250
See you soon, Flash.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.441
What's happening?
Do you think you can reel them in?

32:28.800 --> 32:29.881
I don't know.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.202
I've never felt this much
harmonic feedback.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.488
It feels like the Speed Force
is about to--

-We will be.

but only two come out.

32:52.640 --> 32:53.801
BARRY: Jay...

32:55.600 --> 32:58.604
Jay stayed back

32:59.560 --> 33:00.891
to save Wally.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.448
Come on, Wally, let's get you checked out.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.684
I thought I lost both my boys.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.889
- Thanks for bringing them back.
-You're welcome.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.251
Thank you.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.171
I thought I'd lost you, too.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.160
I'm right here.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.251
The Speed Force.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.930
And it just appeared to you
in the form of Eddie Thawne?

33:49.320 --> 33:51.129
- And Ronnie?
-And Snart.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.245
All to teach me another lesson.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.647
Which was what?

33:55.840 --> 33:58.525
Saving Iris is my responsibility,
mine alone.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.321
It's why the Speed Force
didn't let me take Wally's place,

34:01.600 --> 34:04.763
why Jay sacrificed himself to do it,

34:05.120 --> 34:06.326
so I could finish this.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.281
Jay,

34:09.800 --> 34:11.643
a hero among heroes.

34:11.880 --> 34:12.880
Yeah.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.922
We can't just leave him in there.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.248
We won't.
I'll beat Savitar. We'll get him out.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.889
Good, because it seems to me
the Speed Force

34:21.040 --> 34:23.202
is a little bit of a crazy place.
Just ask Wallace.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.402
Yeah, yeah, what...

34:26.960 --> 34:28.449
What Wally saw,

34:29.440 --> 34:30.804
it's gonna haunt him for a while,

34:31.320 --> 34:33.129
so until he can get past it,

34:33.320 --> 34:34.924
and he's really ready
to go back out there,

34:35.120 --> 34:39.011
Kid Flash is gonna need
to take a break for a while.

34:42.760 --> 34:43.761
JESSE QUICK: Hey.

34:44.679 --> 34:45.726
You Okay?

34:47.199 --> 34:48.485
Are you?

34:48.960 --> 34:50.324
(SCOFFS) Right.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.004
You should see the other guy.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.571
Caitlin said I'll be fine.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.690
Jesse, I can't believe you went
after Savitar by yourself.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.451
What were you thinking?

35:01.960 --> 35:04.361
The same thing you were when you did it.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.530
Yeah, that was a mistake,

35:08.040 --> 35:09.849
one that I will never make again.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.807
Yeah, yeah, me, either.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.003
Not on this Earth anyway.

35:20.040 --> 35:23.522
Wait. What?
You're going back to Earth-2 already?

35:24.120 --> 35:25.610
Earth-3, actually.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.366
But you just got here, Jesse.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.291
I know. I know, and lwanna be with you.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.921
It's just Savitar said he had plans
for me in the future.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.962
I can't let that happen.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.931
Besides, until Barry can get Jay
out of the Speed Force,

35:44.200 --> 35:46.328
Earth-3 needs a Flash to protect it.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.565
I love you, Jesse.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.041
(LAUGHS)

35:58.040 --> 35:59.246
I love you, too.

36:08.680 --> 36:11.763
You show those villains on Earth-3,
nobody messes with our Jesse Quick.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.281
- That's right. You give them hell.
-You know I will.

36:14.480 --> 36:15.925
We're here if you need us, all right?

36:16.600 --> 36:18.170
- Safe travels.
-Thanks.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.482
Sorry, for the, uh...

36:24.080 --> 36:27.289
(LAUGHS) Yeah. Yeah, me, too.
Good left hook.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.650
- Thanks.
-I shouldn't be surprised, us Wellses,

36:31.400 --> 36:33.289
we are forces to be reckoned with.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.125
- That we are.
-Mmm.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.965
Thank you, H.R.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.126
For what?

36:40.600 --> 36:41.886

37:42.440 --> 37:43.930
What exactly are you saying?

37:44.080 --> 37:46.128
You're saying that underneath
the suit of armor, that he's--

37:46.360 --> 37:49.364
Yes, James, he's not a god.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.650
He's just a man, baby!

37:53.240 --> 37:54.401
- A man?
-Yeah.

Um...
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:24.960 --> 38:27.645
So, I just...

38:28.840 --> 38:32.890
You told me that you only wanted
to marry someone

38:33.080 --> 38:36.243
because they love you and not because
they were trying to save you,

38:36.440 --> 38:37.521
<i>and I get that.</i>

38:39.280 --> 38:40.520
I just...

38:43.120 --> 38:46.442
You know, I've lived with a lot of death,

38:46.920 --> 38:51.244
tragedy in my life, and seeing you die?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.844
It's impossible
not to be consumed by that.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.924
Yeah. No, I get that.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.760
<i>I</i> do.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.205
<i>N</i> just...

39:07.520 --> 39:11.411
It made me question if you were asking me
for the right reasons, you know?

39:12.640 --> 39:18.647
If it was out of love or responsibility.

39:20.960 --> 39:25.045
But, look,
while you were gone, I realized something.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.008
I don't have to doubt
why you wanna marry me.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.003
It's the same reason
that I wanna marry you.

39:30.840 --> 39:31.841
Mmm-hmm.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.929
I wanna be your wife, Barry.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.009
(EXHALES) Um...

39:48.560 --> 39:49.561
I love you.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.207
But...

39:57.480 --> 39:58.720
(EXHALES) Uh...

40:05.480 --> 40:06.811
You were right.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.044
I proposed

40:14.000 --> 40:16.002
because I thought it would save you.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.884
I thought Wally would save you.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.606
L...

40:23.000 --> 40:24.286
I was wrong.

40:24.840 --> 40:28.128
I alone have to save you in the future,
and I'm going to,

40:28.360 --> 40:30.010
but not by changing it,

40:31.000 --> 40:32.206
by embracing it.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.689
Okay, um...
(CLEARS THROAT)

40:37.760 --> 40:39.444
What does that mean?

40:42.840 --> 40:48.609
