WEBVTT

00:21.189 --> 00:22.756
What the hell is that?!

00:22.856 --> 00:24.592
Who's there?!

00:37.037 --> 00:38.372
Aah!

00:38.472 --> 00:40.374
Whoa!
Hold the elevator!

00:40.474 --> 00:42.476
Please, please. Oh.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.112
Just in time.
Yeah. Good morning.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.779
Good morning. Wait.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.548
That's Lawrence.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.083
Wait, <i>Lawrence</i> Lawrence?

00:49.183 --> 00:52.019
What? Hold on.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.297
Todd I'm doing
my community service.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.698
We're not supposed
to be on our phones.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
C-Can you hear me?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.901
I'm in an elevator.
This is really important.

01:08.001 --> 01:10.838
Then call 911,
not the convicted criminal

01:10.938 --> 01:13.006
picking up trash
on the side of the highway.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.575
Why is Lawrence here
at my building?

01:14.675 --> 01:17.278
Oh, your building. Okay.
This is his building.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.646
Are you kidding me?

01:18.746 --> 01:21.149
This is not an emergency. Todd,
I got to go.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.750
Bye.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.889
Hey, Marg.
Ah!

01:28.989 --> 01:30.558
See?

01:30.658 --> 01:32.960
I can do casual Friday.
Mm-hmm.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.628
I bought them just
for today.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.063
Oh, wow.
What?

01:36.164 --> 01:37.265
Is it too casual?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.533
No, it's fine.
Your son is here.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.068
Oh. (scoffs) Great.

01:41.169 --> 01:44.805
What did Todd wear
for casual Friday-- a bathrobe?

01:44.905 --> 01:46.407
No, no, Margaret,
your other son.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.343
Mother.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.412
Lawrence. Oh!

01:51.512 --> 01:54.282
What a pleasure. Oh.
Are you here

01:54.382 --> 01:56.817
for lunch?
No, I'm here
on official business.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.786
Oh.
Go for clear. Sweep it up.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.189
Do you have a moment?
Oh, well, yes, of course.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.690
The governor
would like to speak to you

02:02.790 --> 02:04.225
about a private matter.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.026
She's looking for some legal
assistance outside the sphere

02:06.194 --> 02:08.396
of her normal advisors.
Since she did a favor for you

02:08.496 --> 02:10.231
on Thanksgiving...
Oh, well, I would be thrilled

02:10.331 --> 02:12.233
to return the favor.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.302
When will the governor arrive?
Right now.

02:14.402 --> 02:17.205
Oh.
Oh, my God.
I'm... I'm wearing Crocs.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.406
Hello. Hello.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.807
Uh, what a pleasure.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.809
I voted for you. Hello.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.044
Margaret Wright,
a pleasure to finally

02:24.212 --> 02:26.214
meet the woman
who made Lawrence

02:26.214 --> 02:28.449
the outstanding
man he is today.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.785
Might there be a more discrete
room for us to speak in?

02:31.885 --> 02:33.821
Oh, yes, of course.
Uh, Francey,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.456
uh, the governor.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.291
Please take her
to the conference room.
Right this way.

02:37.391 --> 02:40.228
The big one,
the big one!
Yeah, okay.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.365
Okay.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.109
Please have a seat.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.712
Oh.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.448
Yes, of course.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.352
How can I be of service?

03:04.452 --> 03:06.454
As a mother of three children,
I'm guessing

03:06.554 --> 03:09.723
you have a general understanding
of complicated family dynamics.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.924
Yes.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.393
It's my sister, Debby.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.695
She's always been
the problem child.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.997
Could never hold a job,
always needed money,

03:17.097 --> 03:19.300
constantly in a mess
of trouble and then

03:19.400 --> 03:21.369
expecting me
to sweep in and fix it.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.737
I understand completely.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.974
When our grandmother died,
she left her farm in McMinnville

03:27.074 --> 03:28.642
to us. We share ownership.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.344
I was never interested
in the farm,

03:30.444 --> 03:32.713
but Debby wanted to live there
and work the land.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.748
I thought it would be
a disaster, but

03:34.848 --> 03:37.285
Debby got sober and did it.
For ten years,

03:37.385 --> 03:38.852
she was stable,

03:38.952 --> 03:40.854
financially and emotionally.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.357
But something
has recently changed?

03:43.457 --> 03:45.393
I'm worried that
she's backsliding.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.060
Ah-ha. How can I help?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.362
From what I can gather,

03:48.462 --> 03:50.464
there's a man
squatting on our land

03:50.564 --> 03:52.032
and he's causing problems.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.934
I don't know what their
relationship is, but I need

03:54.034 --> 03:55.736
him removed from the property,

03:55.836 --> 03:57.638
legally, officially,
and quietly.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.373
It sounds simple enough.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.409
Not really.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.344
Apparently,
the man is a veteran.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.347
Oh, I understand.
That is sensitive.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.182
Exactly. And I can't have
the press finding out about this

04:09.317 --> 04:10.618
and turning it
into some sort of scandal.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.887
I will meet with her,
assess the situation,

04:13.987 --> 04:15.323
de-escalate any conflict

04:15.423 --> 04:18.359
and handle the eviction
myself, discreetly.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.328
Thank you.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.662
And may I ask,

04:21.762 --> 04:25.098
where did you get
this gorgeous scarf?
Oh.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.435
I'm so glad
that you did ask.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.437
Nothing of note,
but we did detain

04:29.537 --> 04:31.939
a suspicious character
attempting to breach.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.342
He seems unhinged.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.243
Yes, hi, hey. Good to see you.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.745
Can you please tell her
that I work here?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.547
I'll handle it.
You can take five.
All right.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.416
Yeah, take five.
See? He is my brother.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.919
Your fellow robots
are super kind.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.087
Where do I get one
of these little

04:47.187 --> 04:49.357
mini pincer-
cutter things?

04:49.357 --> 04:50.724
Mini Leatherman?
Yeah.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.225
No idea.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.861
Mother and the governor
should be done shortly.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.195
This is what you wear to work?

04:55.363 --> 04:56.564
It's casual Friday.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.532
Wait, the governor's
here for Mom?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.834
Wow. So, should I not
detonate my bomb

05:00.934 --> 05:01.935
until after the governor leaves?

05:02.035 --> 05:04.372
Do not joke about B-O-M-B-S'.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.508
What, about bombs?
Oh, there you are.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.776
My boys.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.978
Don't worry, I'm his mother.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.513
So, I have just had

05:12.613 --> 05:15.449
the most brilliant little
chat with the governor,

05:15.549 --> 05:18.386
and I think we can
help her out.
With what?

05:18.386 --> 05:20.053
No. No.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.722
I don't want Todd...
We-we don't...

05:21.822 --> 05:22.956
The governor

05:23.056 --> 05:25.493
and I... The State of Oregon...

05:25.593 --> 05:27.695
You're speaking for the entire
state of Oregon now?

05:27.795 --> 05:31.665
...would prefer that Todd not
be involved in this situation.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.167
Lawrence, Todd works here
as an investigator.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.803
Yes, thank you.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.871
It's the governor.
My boss.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.773
Understood.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.942
Wow, just like that?
What? No, no, Todd, it's okay.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.945
You'll have plenty of time
to get to know the governor.

05:45.045 --> 05:45.979
He will?
I will?
Yes.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.649
I've invited her to dinner.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.150
First the mayor,

05:50.250 --> 05:53.687
now the governor.
What's next?

05:53.787 --> 05:57.057
I'm sure the king's coronation
is right around the corner.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.826
Oh, boy.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.432
Well, she's not
answering her phone,

06:04.532 --> 06:06.634
and Debby's not
at the house.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.301
I mean, what can
you possibly do

06:08.436 --> 06:10.103
on a farm like this
in the winter?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.705
You said 50 acres?
Uh-huh.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.674
A place this size,
she could be off tending

06:13.774 --> 06:15.008
to any number of chores.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.944
I mean, even winterizing
her blueberries.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.481
What do you
know about farms, Lyle?

06:21.949 --> 06:24.351
Get down! Get down!

06:34.227 --> 06:35.663
Don't shoot!

06:38.699 --> 06:40.468
I'm attorney Margaret Wright

06:40.568 --> 06:42.035
and I'm here to help you.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.471
You, you're going. Oh...

06:43.471 --> 06:45.072
And this is Lyle Burton.
Hi. H-Hey, I'm Lyle.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.707
He works for me.

06:46.807 --> 06:47.808
This is my son, Todd,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.477
who clearly
followed us here, but is

06:49.477 --> 06:50.978
not supposed to be here.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.480
Yeah, but only 'cause
my brother's a jerk

06:52.480 --> 06:54.014
and he won't let me
live my life.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.016
Why are you trespassing
on my land?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.486
Uh, w-we're here to help you.

06:58.486 --> 07:01.021
Your-your sister sent us.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.257
Your s-sister Willa.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.294
She said...

07:07.394 --> 07:08.829
Uh... that...
She's got a bat.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.163
I see the bat.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.933
That-that you-you need help
evicting someone.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.802
Yeah. I do.

07:14.902 --> 07:15.769
Wait,

07:15.869 --> 07:17.270
these speakers--

07:17.370 --> 07:18.772
you were just
projecting the sound

07:18.872 --> 07:20.641
of gunfire?
This was all fake?

07:20.741 --> 07:22.510
I don't want to hurt anyone.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.878
I'm just trying to keep
me and my land safe.

07:24.978 --> 07:25.913
Safe from who?

07:26.013 --> 07:27.581
I have no idea.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.850
But somebody is watching me,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.184
terrorizing me,

07:31.284 --> 07:32.686
leaving dead squirrels
inside of my house.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.155
There's these
buzzing sounds

07:35.255 --> 07:37.124
and-and lights

07:37.224 --> 07:39.392
in the sky.
Oh, so, aliens.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.729
Close encounters type stuff,
UFOs, little grey men?

07:41.829 --> 07:43.664
See, this is why
you weren't invited.
I don't even believe

07:43.764 --> 07:45.899
in UFOs,
but I am seeing something.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.335
And do you think
that this-this tenant--

07:48.435 --> 07:49.670
the one that your sister
told us about,

07:49.770 --> 07:51.071
the one that you
want to evict--

07:51.171 --> 07:53.173
do you think that he's trying
to frighten you?

07:53.273 --> 07:55.242
I hate to think that it's Ben.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.444
We met in rehab.
I-I'm still sober,

07:57.545 --> 07:59.780
but he hit a rough patch,

07:59.880 --> 08:01.715
and he asked me
if he could crash in my RV,

08:01.815 --> 08:05.218
and I said yes if he pays rent,

08:05.318 --> 08:07.254
but he hasn't.
Not a dime.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.922
Did you make him
sign a lease?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.057
I should have,

08:10.157 --> 08:11.759
but, you know,
he's been through a lot.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.393
I would have let him
stay here for free,

08:13.561 --> 08:16.564
but I make ends meet on this
farm by renting out that RV.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.866
Did you ask him to leave?
Yes.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.068
He got really angry
and he went off on me.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.202
Honestly, I was afraid.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.271
So, Ben is squatting

08:24.371 --> 08:26.439
on your property, rent-free.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.142
So, we've already
drawn up a notice

08:29.242 --> 08:32.279
to quit, and your sister,

08:32.379 --> 08:34.582
the governor, has-has signed it.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.683
Lyle, pen. Oh.

08:35.783 --> 08:36.884
Here, I'll
take the bat.

08:36.984 --> 08:37.918
If he

08:38.018 --> 08:39.152
is harassing you

08:39.252 --> 08:41.254
and causing difficulties,
it just makes

08:41.354 --> 08:44.191
our job that much easier.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.294
Yeah.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.696
Okay.
Okay?

08:48.796 --> 08:50.998
Yeah. But when you do it,

08:51.098 --> 08:52.700
please be careful.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.902
I have no idea what
he's capable of right now.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.638
That's all right,
I have experience,

08:57.738 --> 08:59.406
lots of experience,
with difficult people.

08:59.506 --> 09:02.710
Plenty of experience.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.311
They're talking
about my brother.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.713
Mm.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.347
Then don't tell him
I was with you.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.149
I mean, since when does
Lawrence get to dictate

09:09.249 --> 09:10.618
your and my career?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.519
I don't know,
since his boss the governor

09:12.620 --> 09:13.787
became our client?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.088
He has a point, Todd.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.490
Can you believe
I was wearing Crocs?

09:17.625 --> 09:20.293
Anyway, Debby is clearly
being terrorized

09:20.393 --> 09:21.762
by something or someone.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.032
I hate to say it, but...
flying lights,

09:25.132 --> 09:27.635
spooky sounds-- is it possible
Debby is imagining this?

09:27.735 --> 09:30.337
I still think it
could be aliens.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.706
I mean, these are the
exact types of places

09:32.806 --> 09:34.141
aliens would strike.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.476
Little grey guys with
those big black eyes.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.945
What? They're not gr...
First of all,

09:38.045 --> 09:40.047
they're tall,
elongated, green.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.416
Oh, don't be absurd.
If aliens do come,

09:43.516 --> 09:45.653
maybe they'll be like
that handsome young man

09:45.753 --> 09:48.388
Jeff Bridgerton
in the <i>Starman</i> movie.
Jeff Bridges.

09:48.488 --> 09:51.091
And, oh, my gosh, and when
he left her at the end,

09:51.191 --> 09:53.293
and she's pregnant...
Well, excuse me.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.695
Thank you. Spoiler.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.930
Must be the place.
Okay, if this doesn't go well...

09:57.030 --> 09:58.131
I've got your back.
I've got you covered.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.867
I got her back.
I got her covered.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.301
She's my mom!
You're not even
supposed to be here.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.535
What do you...
You do not have my mom's back.

10:02.636 --> 10:02.970
I've got-I've got it.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.741
Mr. Ben Cooper?

10:07.841 --> 10:10.310
That's me.
What do you want?

10:10.410 --> 10:12.846
I'm Margaret Wright,
representing Debby Jones.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.648
I'm serving you notice to quit.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.083
You're serving me?

10:16.183 --> 10:18.451
Yes, you have three days
to vacate the property.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.121
Wow.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.790
You can tell Debby

10:22.890 --> 10:24.424
that she's a traitor,

10:24.524 --> 10:26.026
and I'm not leaving

10:26.126 --> 10:29.096
until I'm back on my feet,
like we agreed.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.964
Uh, hey, man.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.700
See your patch.
Thank you for your service.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.102
What do you care?

10:36.169 --> 10:37.070
Air Force.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.739
Whatever, flyboy.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.808
The fact that I served

10:40.908 --> 10:42.342
doesn't really change
this, though, does it?

10:42.442 --> 10:45.245
Yeah, yeah, yeah, pipe down
flyboy. So, have you seen

10:45.345 --> 10:46.847
anything strange at night?

10:46.947 --> 10:48.581
Like weird lights
or flying things?

10:48.682 --> 10:51.752
What are you talking about?
Now you're calling me crazy.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.287
Why don't you go ask those
weirdos Sarah and Joe.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.923
Sarah and Joe?

10:56.023 --> 10:58.826
Yeah, the neighbors.
They're... kooky.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.160
Probably find
them at their

11:00.260 --> 11:01.962
mushroom booth
at the farmer's market.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.331
And you can tell Debby

11:04.431 --> 11:06.033
thanks for nothing.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.538
These are beautiful.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.907
Oh, oh, I can't believe
you have them so fresh

11:14.007 --> 11:15.008
at this time of year.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.409
There's the
mushroom stand.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.045
Okay, great.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.412
Well, there's the neighbors.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.948
Let's go see what they know
about these

11:21.048 --> 11:22.750
"extraterrestrial"
beings in the night.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.818
Wait, these mushrooms
are magic mushrooms?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.520
Okay, now it'll be weird
if they haven't seen aliens.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.655
Hi, there. Hey.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.323
Welcome to
Pure Mind Trip.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.893
Welcome.
I'm Sarah.
This is my husband Joe.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.161
Hi.
Can we answer

11:34.261 --> 11:36.229
any questions that
you might have?

11:36.329 --> 11:37.364
Yes, actually.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.532
It's just amazing
that all of this

11:39.632 --> 11:40.934
is legal now in Oregon.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.469
Psychedelic mushrooms are

11:42.569 --> 11:43.804
100% legal.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.238
Hallelujah.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.606
Hallelujah. Um...

11:46.774 --> 11:48.675
Cosmic Morning.
Oh, it's one of our best.

11:48.776 --> 11:52.780
It will start you on a journey
to truly transform your life.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.214
And-and you can
do it by yourself,

11:54.314 --> 11:55.883
but it's even better
with a guide.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.650
Which is also a
service we provide,

11:57.785 --> 11:58.786
if you're interested.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.053
No. No, thank you. not today.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.856
No transforming today.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.992
Uh, I'm Margaret Wright.
I'm an attorney.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.794
And we're actually here
to talk to you

12:06.894 --> 12:08.896
about your neighbor,
Ben Cooper.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.564
He did mention that he
and his landlord, Debby,

12:11.664 --> 12:12.800
have had a tough time.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.801
I guess she Yeah.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.268
asked him to leave,

12:15.368 --> 12:16.269
and it got...

12:16.369 --> 12:18.271
heated.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.973
And that lines up,

12:20.073 --> 12:22.475
which is exactly why
we're here today.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.344
I hate to say it,
but it probably is for the best

12:24.444 --> 12:26.980
if he goes, uh,
with that temper of his.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.582
We need to foster
a tranquil atmosphere

12:29.682 --> 12:30.818
up here for our clients.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.219
For the healing.
For the healing.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.620
For the healing, right.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.889
And these guided trips--
they're on your farm?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.991
Yes. People are

12:38.091 --> 12:39.960
eating it up, literally.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.830
'Cause mushrooms, Lyle. Yeah.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.331
It's like the gold rush

12:44.431 --> 12:45.833
up here. We can't
grow mushrooms

12:45.833 --> 12:47.000
fast enough.
My love,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.536
we do have a
client zoom in two.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.205
Yeah, but thank you
so much for coming by.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.007
We would be happy
to help you

12:54.107 --> 12:55.909
find your way into
another world someday.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.610
You never know
what you might find...

12:57.710 --> 12:59.913
Mm-hmm.
...inside.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.481
Inside.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.584
Oh, uh, thank you very much,
and we will be in touch.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.519
Okay, lovely.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.422
Freak shows masquerading
as self-help gurus?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.258
No, thank you very much.
I know,

13:11.358 --> 13:12.860
crazy, right?
They probably think aliens

13:12.960 --> 13:15.462
are tall, elongated,
green, wet.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.664
I didn't say wet.
They're not wet. Oh.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.333
You kind of...
Todd, I need you
to go get Allison

13:20.433 --> 13:22.635
from her
volunteer work.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.604
What? I thought
you were picking her up.
Well, I was,

13:24.704 --> 13:26.874
but Lyle and I have to
go to the courthouse

13:26.974 --> 13:28.241
to get Debby's
property deeds.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.143
Todd, here's lunch.
No, that's not food.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.979
No, I... Todd.

13:32.079 --> 13:32.980
Actually pretty good.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.181
Okay, I'll be right back.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.116
Looks like it's starting
to snow again.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.317
I'm gonna go get the car

13:37.417 --> 13:38.651
and get some kettle corn.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.054
Oh. Get me some, too.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.756
How about I
read your palm?

13:45.192 --> 13:47.627
Oh...
No, thank you.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.063
I-I don't believe in that stuff.
Why not?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.899
It's fun.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.667
We all need a little fun, right?

13:54.767 --> 13:58.271
Oh. (chuckles) Well, um...

13:58.371 --> 14:01.474
Okay.
Fun. That sounds good.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.711
Uh, but I'm only paying
five dollars.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.479
Oh, no charge.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.753
Ah...

14:15.288 --> 14:17.090
Someone broke your heart.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.760
Abandoned you.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.162
Hurtful things were said.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.132
As they are in every
relationship break-up.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.368
Sometimes we
carry that hurt

14:28.468 --> 14:30.003
longer than we should.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.005
It's blocking you.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.174
Uh... that's nonsense.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.010
I'm not blocked.
Nothing is blocking me.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.380
Here. Take this.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.814
When you're ready,

14:41.949 --> 14:44.684
use this charm to
remove your block,

14:44.784 --> 14:45.852
and it will bring you

14:45.953 --> 14:48.488
your heart's desire.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.025
Oh, um...

14:52.125 --> 14:55.162
Thank you for your time
and for this.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.530
Even though it is nonsense.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.503
Just gonna...

15:04.804 --> 15:06.839
Thank you.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.580
Thank you for picking me up,
but I did not need the honk.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.448
Yeah, well...

15:15.548 --> 15:17.317
Sorry, I'm just trying
to deliver you

15:17.417 --> 15:19.386
from your trash situation
in a timely manner,

15:19.486 --> 15:20.787
and now I got
Lawrence on my back

15:20.887 --> 15:22.722
trying to state-mandate
my job from me.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.391
He's trying to get you fired?
Basically.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.459
He doesn't trust me
to work on the governor's

15:26.559 --> 15:28.996
sister's alien abduction
psychedelic mushroom case

15:29.096 --> 15:30.530
in McMinnville.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.665
That is a group of words
never before strung together.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.701
Like I'm gonna
humiliate him somehow.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.669
I mean, you're the criminal
on the side of the road

15:36.769 --> 15:39.106
picking up trash in a
highlighter yellow vest.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.573
You look insane, by the way.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.175
Thank you, thank you so much.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.012
That is exactly the cherry that
I needed on the cake of today.

15:45.012 --> 15:48.015
Someone in a passing car
threw a full Slurpee at my head.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.017
What?
A blue one.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.252
Also, I don't want Lawrence
to know I was arrested.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.555
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll just
continue to keep your secrets.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.224
Either way, I'm sure
he'll totally accept you

15:57.324 --> 15:59.259
for who you are,
criminal behavior and all.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.793
I mean, he just loves things

16:01.028 --> 16:02.529
that could potentially
embarrass him

16:02.629 --> 16:05.398
and ruin his
political future, so...

16:05.498 --> 16:07.300
If he does run for
governor someday,

16:07.400 --> 16:08.301
are we gonna support him?

16:08.401 --> 16:09.169
No.
Yes.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.403
No.
Yes!

16:10.503 --> 16:11.304
Are you joking?
Are you kidding me?

16:11.404 --> 16:12.472
Oh, my God.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.540
You want to wear
red, white, and blue

16:13.640 --> 16:14.841
for the rest
of your life?

16:14.941 --> 16:17.310
No, I will wear
Oregon state colors.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.911
Great.
Get in the car.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.680
<i>If Ben won't vacate,</i>

16:20.780 --> 16:22.682
we need to be
prepared to evict.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.917
So let's confirm proper
ownership with the deed,

16:25.052 --> 16:27.287
get a clear idea of where
the property lines are

16:27.387 --> 16:29.256
and where the RV is located.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.059
This is the map of the farm.

16:32.059 --> 16:35.728
It's expansive. Mm-hmm.
The RV is located here.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.564
Well within property boundaries.
Mm-hmm.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.167
And... here is the deed.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.969
Okay. Well...

16:43.070 --> 16:44.304
What is this?

16:44.404 --> 16:46.273
It looks like somebody
filed a lis pendens.

16:46.373 --> 16:50.077
Property law terms are outside
my realm of expertise.

16:50.177 --> 16:54.081
It means someone filed a lawsuit
and put a lien on the property.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.949
Do you think the lawsuit and
the scare tactics are related?

16:57.084 --> 17:00.587
I think somebody's trying
to take possession of the farm.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.955
We need to figure out
who filed this lawsuit.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.092
Looks like someone figured out
it's gonna take a lot more

17:05.092 --> 17:06.893
than dead squirrels
to scare her off the property.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.229
Mm-hmm. Ah.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.231
Here she is. Hi, Debby.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.100
We were just talking...
It's burning.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.601
Wait. What is burning?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.103
Margaret, my farm is on fire.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.270
Oh, my God.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.773
Margaret, my farm is on fire!

17:33.120 --> 17:34.421
Debby, are you okay?

17:34.521 --> 17:36.123
I... Yeah, I'm fine.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.657
Oh, my gosh.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.792
Who could have done this?
This is arson.
I know

17:39.892 --> 17:41.761
Ben has been angry ever since
I asked him to leave,

17:41.861 --> 17:43.596
but I never thought that
he would do something like this.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.533
Ma'am, are you
the farm owner?
Yes.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.900
I own the farm. Why?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.736
In the structure
that burned down,

17:49.836 --> 17:51.738
we found remnants
of drug-cooking material,

17:51.838 --> 17:54.774
as well as this metal box
containing methamphetamine.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.710
Oh, my gosh. Do you know
how that got there?
No.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.479
Those are not mine.
Listen, when my sister let me

17:59.579 --> 18:01.281
run this farm,
it literally

18:01.381 --> 18:03.550
saved my life. I would not
risk that for anything.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.884
Are you Debby Jones?
Yes,

18:04.984 --> 18:06.319
I'm Debby Jones.
You're under arrest

18:06.419 --> 18:08.155
for felony possession of
a controlled substance.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.523
Uh, no, that is not true.
I am clean.
Wait, wait...

18:10.623 --> 18:11.824
Margaret, listen to me.
I am clean.

18:11.924 --> 18:12.925
You have the right
to remain silent.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.161
I have nothing to do with this.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.662
I will follow you
to the station.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.497
Don't say a word
until I get there.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.831
Anything you say can
and will be used

18:18.931 --> 18:20.367
against you
in a court of law.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.369
What a disaster.
Mm-hmm.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.803
But you bailed Debby
out of jail?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.438
Yes. Yes, of course.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.240
But we need to
get her a hotel

18:27.340 --> 18:29.309
because she's too afraid
to go back to the farm tonight.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.845
And I had to call the governor
and explain all of that to her.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.647
It was humiliating.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.716
I am letting the governor down.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.251
Damn it.
There it is.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.953
Can you please file this
bail release form? Thank you.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.689
What is this?
Ugh.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.724
It is nonsense.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.759
It's a charm bag.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.628
Some silly psychic
gave it to me

18:48.728 --> 18:50.330
to help
"bring me what I desire."

18:50.430 --> 18:52.031
Oh, I don't know.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.967
A psychic once told me
I'd meet a cop, and I did. Oh.

18:55.067 --> 18:58.638
Well, this charlatan
told me that I am blocked.

18:58.738 --> 18:59.939
Blocked? You're not blocked. Blocked.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.541
I am not blocked. No.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.942
I am free to get what I desire.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.477
And what I desire
is to figure out

19:04.577 --> 19:07.614
who is intimidating Debby
and what all this nonsense

19:07.714 --> 19:09.882
at the farm at night
is all about.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.751
And... the only way to do that

19:11.851 --> 19:16.223
is to go back there
myself tonight.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.125
And I am brave enough
to do that, and-and nothing

19:19.226 --> 19:21.361
is blocking me from
doing that, so...

19:23.396 --> 19:25.232
What is going on
in my office?
Oh.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.766
Oh, thank you.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.868
I'll get Debby the hotel.
The hotel.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.238
Who is arguing in there?

19:31.338 --> 19:33.240
You don't get to just bust
in here with the governor's

19:33.240 --> 19:35.041
storm troopers
and tell me how to do my job.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.977
Okay.
I work as a detective
on Mom's cases.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.712
Not if it involves the
governor. That is my domain.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.649
Okay? Because I am
the chief of staff...
Chief of staff.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.251
And everybody knows
and nobody cares.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.885
Just face it,
you are a glorified butler.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.454
Oh, okay.
You are like a robot vacuum

19:47.554 --> 19:48.788
cleaning up
the governor's messes.
What are you, huh?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.089
What are you, Todd?
Stop it!

19:50.823 --> 19:53.693
Stop fighting. Good God, they
can hear you on the first floor.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.462
It's like stepping back
into the basement

19:55.562 --> 19:56.629
in 2001.

19:56.729 --> 19:57.964
That was him!
That was him!

19:58.064 --> 19:59.799
That was both of you.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.869
Lawrence, darling,
why are you here?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.737
The governor
sent me to follow up.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.640
She's upset about the update
on her sister's "situation."

20:07.740 --> 20:09.276
He can't even do
air quotes correctly.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.411
Can you please tell this laptop
I'm on the case now?

20:11.511 --> 20:13.913
All right.
I am not going to be stopped

20:14.013 --> 20:15.748
by your negative energy.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.083
Todd.
Yeah.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.585
You would like
to stay on the case

20:18.685 --> 20:20.152
and help me solve it, yes?

20:20.253 --> 20:22.121
Yeah.
Great. And Lawrence,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.491
you would like some answers
for your boss, correct?

20:24.591 --> 20:25.558
Yes.
Fantastic.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.059
Me too.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.461
I am going to kill two birds
with one stone.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.497
Wait, are we the birds?
We're the stones.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.731
We're not the stones.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.100
Are we the stones?
No.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.568
Here's what we're going to do.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.136
We're going to go on a mandatory
family field trip.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.905
We are going
to go get some supplies.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.707
And then we are going
out to that farm

20:40.807 --> 20:43.876
and we're going to figure out
what is going on out there,

20:43.976 --> 20:45.878
so help me God.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.248
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.552
Okay, that's, like,
really, really mature.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.424
Thank you.
Well, the local police

20:57.524 --> 20:58.958
verified Ben's alibi.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.693
He was at an AA meeting

21:00.793 --> 21:02.462
the night of the fire. Great.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.031
What's going on outside,
Todd-- anything yet?

21:05.131 --> 21:06.733
No, nothing. I mean,
maybe this is just a case

21:06.833 --> 21:09.336
of mass hysteria or people
doing too many magic mushrooms.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.371
Have you ever done mushrooms?

21:11.471 --> 21:13.039
Yeah.
Like, two and a half times.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.441
Why, have you?

21:14.541 --> 21:17.076
Yes, in college.
But it wasn't any fun.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.945
I spent the whole night
cleaning a toaster oven.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.382
Dinner is almost ready. Mmm.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.249
Thank you, Siri.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.418
Todd.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.187
When will you two
learn to respect each another?

21:28.355 --> 21:31.724
I am so tired
of all of this squabbling.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.025
I mean,

21:33.125 --> 21:34.894
think about the governor
and her sister.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.364
They barely talk to one another.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.099
Is that how you two
want to end up once I'm gone?

21:40.199 --> 21:41.734
No.
No.
No.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.671
Well, what do you two want?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.573
Well, I think
it's pretty obvi...
Ah, eldest

21:46.673 --> 21:47.740
to youngest.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.542
Lawrence first.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.078
I... want world peace.

21:52.178 --> 21:53.680
Oh, great.
That's very original.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.515
I want Clem

21:55.615 --> 21:58.751
to sleep through the night
in a regular bed.
That's fair.

21:58.851 --> 21:59.852
I want to collect

21:59.952 --> 22:02.922
all of these beautiful colors

22:03.022 --> 22:06.526
and put them in my pocket.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.028
Pocket?

22:09.128 --> 22:10.797
I want an enormous,

22:10.897 --> 22:13.199
scratchy tongue.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.402
What?
Like a-like a...
like a cat's tongue,

22:15.402 --> 22:17.470
but not attached to a cat,

22:17.570 --> 22:18.805
to fly over

22:18.905 --> 22:20.807
the state of Oregon

22:20.907 --> 22:22.875
and lick clean all the people

22:22.975 --> 22:25.111
and all of the...

22:25.211 --> 22:29.248
the saltwater taffy
from Cannon Beach.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.552
I want this finger

22:32.652 --> 22:36.723
to get along
with this finger.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.025
Lawrence, Lawrence,
are you all right?

22:39.125 --> 22:40.259
What is wrong with you?

22:40.427 --> 22:41.928
Question for you.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.330
Did you make tea
from this box?

22:44.431 --> 22:46.298
Oh, yeah.
And you drank this tea?

22:46.433 --> 22:48.868
Yeah.
This is the psilocybin
mushroom tea

22:48.968 --> 22:50.870
that the weirdo couple makes.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.239
Mom, Lawrence is tripping.

22:53.339 --> 22:54.340
I'm not tripping.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.875
I'm sitting very still.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.644
Okay.

22:57.744 --> 22:58.978
Oh.
Oh, God.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.312
He has a fever.
Here you go.

23:00.447 --> 23:01.881
I mean, no, he's gonna be fine.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.783
Um, just don't let him drink
any more of that tea

23:03.883 --> 23:06.285
and make sure
he drinks plenty of water.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.987
Oh, wow. Great
professional opinion.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.321
I could drink more water.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.823
I could drink an ocean of tears.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.827
I could put Mahatma Gandhi
in my cubby at school.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.463
Can you believe this?

23:16.463 --> 23:18.765
Wow. That's our Lawrence?

23:18.865 --> 23:21.300
Okay, Allison, you do not need
to stay on for this.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.769
You can go now.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.471
No, no,
I'm actually enjoying this.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.505
Want to know what I enjoy?

23:25.605 --> 23:27.073
Please tell me, Lawrence.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.307
My freedom!
Oh, boy.

23:28.475 --> 23:29.676
Lawrence.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.210
Oh.
Lawrence, Lawrence,
Lawrence, okay?

23:31.310 --> 23:33.880
It is me, your mother
and your sister and...

23:33.980 --> 23:35.314
And Todd.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.283
Todd gets in trouble, and he...

23:37.383 --> 23:39.586
he does stupid things. He's bad.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.788
Yeah.
He got arrested.
He's a criminal.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.490
He's a criminal. I can't have
criminals in my family.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.992
I'm gonna be the governor
of Oregon one day.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.827
Yes, you are, yes.

23:47.927 --> 23:51.397
A big, pink governor with arms. Yes.

23:52.331 --> 23:53.666
Yes.
But Todd likes
to embarrass me.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.935
He likes to embarrass me,
and I... I just...

23:56.035 --> 23:58.805
I just... I want him to...
I want him... I want him to...

23:59.772 --> 24:02.008
I want him to...

24:03.109 --> 24:05.344
I want him to like me.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.580
What?

24:08.515 --> 24:11.518
You want me to like you?

24:11.618 --> 24:12.819
That was unexpected.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.386
Well, of course
he wants him to like him.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.888
He's his brother.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.524
W-Wait, wait, wait.
Lawrence, look at me real quick.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.526
Yeah.
You want me to...

24:20.893 --> 24:22.228
Someone's pounding
on the back door!

24:22.328 --> 24:23.663
It isn't Debby.
She's at a hotel.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.065
Oh.
Okay.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.133
You go look.
Don't push me.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.935
You look.
Okay. Uh...

24:29.035 --> 24:31.604
No, I honestly...
Move, please.
Shh. You scared me.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.806
What is that?

24:33.906 --> 24:35.374
Can somebody who's not Lawrence
please explain

24:35.542 --> 24:36.743
to me what's going on right now?

24:36.843 --> 24:38.344
Todd. Come here.
Uh-huh.

24:38.444 --> 24:41.614
Would you open the door?

24:41.714 --> 24:43.282
Allison, you take care
of your brother.

24:43.382 --> 24:46.719
Mom, I'm-I'm on the phone.
I can't... I can't do anything.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.821
Okay.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.960
Oh.
Oh.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.335
Todd. Did you see anything?
No. Don't know where they went.

25:03.435 --> 25:04.436
Listen. Listen.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.706
What is that?
I don't know.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.140
Oh.
Ow.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.576
What is that?
I don't know.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.277
It's weird.
Mom, you're gonna kill me,

25:11.377 --> 25:12.912
but I think it's aliens.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.581
Oh, Todd, it's not aliens.
No, no, no, I'm telling you.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.248
This is how
every alien movie starts...

25:16.348 --> 25:17.717
Todd!
What?

25:17.817 --> 25:20.252
It is absolutely not aliens.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.388
Oh, my God!
We're gonna get abducted.

25:22.488 --> 25:23.856
Mom, it's definitely aliens.

25:23.956 --> 25:26.058
Wait, wait, wait.
Todd, what's that?
What?

25:27.259 --> 25:28.595
It's a plane.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.932
It's a drone.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.268
It's getting closer.
It's getting closer.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.606
Hold on. Hold on. No.
Aah! It's chasing me!

25:39.606 --> 25:41.874
Todd, come over.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.343
Come over here, Todd.
Aah! Oh. Okay. Okay.

25:44.443 --> 25:46.378
What's wrong with you?
Todd.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.180
What? Okay.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.382
Honestly, Mom,
I think I can take it.
What?

25:50.482 --> 25:52.284
I just need a... Oh.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.186
Wait here.
Go! You take it out.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.521
Throw it right here. Okay.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.623
Okay.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.190
Throw it!
No, no, no. Uh...

25:58.290 --> 25:59.626
go long.
No. What?

25:59.626 --> 26:01.628
Li-Like football.
No, I'm good right here.

26:01.628 --> 26:03.129
Get it to chase you.
Todd, I don't want to go long.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.631
Go, go, go. Just leave.
Football. I want to go short.

26:04.631 --> 26:06.432
Just go.
Would you quite pushing me?!

26:06.532 --> 26:09.001
Oh, I don't want to go long!

26:10.002 --> 26:12.038
Come-come back.
L-Like a button hook.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.406
What?

26:14.506 --> 26:16.976
Football!

26:21.781 --> 26:23.549
Oh! I got it!

26:23.650 --> 26:24.951
Oh!
Yeah! Yeah!

26:25.051 --> 26:26.185
Yeah, yeah.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.154
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

26:30.990 --> 26:33.893
So, now we know
Debby's not crazy.

26:33.993 --> 26:37.730
Somebody is trying to scare her
and us off her property

26:37.830 --> 26:39.732
with this flying
metal monster.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.500
It sustained
some heavy damage.

26:41.668 --> 26:44.370
Yeah, 'cause I took it down
with one shot. Yes.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.772
Because you had me running long.

26:45.872 --> 26:46.973
Yeah, 'cause I was
the quarterback.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.440
Yeah, but I was
the wide one.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.343
The receiver?
But anyway, never mind.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.879
We need to know
who is doing this and why.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.047
I may be able
to get some information

26:55.147 --> 26:57.784
from this severely
compromised SD card.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.686
Yeah, info like
what planet is it from

26:59.686 --> 27:02.922
and are the aliens there tall,
green and wet, like asparagus?

27:03.022 --> 27:04.390
Aspar...
Oh, my God!

27:04.490 --> 27:05.591
Asparagus.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.293
Todd, the caterer. The...

27:07.393 --> 27:08.928
We're having dinner
with the governor

27:09.028 --> 27:11.998
at my house in two hours.
We have to go.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.700
Oh, hey.
I did that research for you.

27:13.700 --> 27:17.569
Uh-huh.
The lien on Debby's farm
was filed by an entity

27:17.704 --> 27:18.971
located in Jamaica.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.740
What?
A shell corporation named

27:20.840 --> 27:24.043
Lucea Operating Systems.
Lucea Operating Systems.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.511
Super.
Todd, remember that.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.246
Susan, thank you so much,
but I really can't talk

27:27.346 --> 27:28.781
about all of this right now
because we have to go.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.149
We're having dinner
with the governor.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.718
And Todd, I cannot
be dressed like this.

27:31.718 --> 27:32.719
Okay, then change.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.053
We have to go!

27:34.153 --> 27:35.321
We're having dinner
with the governor.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.991
...on the phone,
but I want to remind you

27:39.091 --> 27:40.727
that he is voting against

27:40.727 --> 27:42.261
your proposal
regarding decommissioning...

27:43.362 --> 27:44.764
Decidedly so.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.966
That's all right,
I'll speak to him.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.768
Thanks.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.269
Hello. Yes.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.637
I understand.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.072
No, Todd. No.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.007
We are not starting
without the governor. It's rude.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.276
But is the governor ever gonna
come back to the table?

27:57.376 --> 28:00.747
My food is getting cold.
It is always like this.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.749
Does she ever stop?

28:02.749 --> 28:04.416
To sit? To eat?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.753
They hooked up a printer
in the bathroom.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.020
A printer?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.856
No one use the bathroom.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.458
I'm sorry
this is taking so long.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.826
No, no, no.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.594
It's perfectly fine.

28:15.762 --> 28:18.030
It's the governor.
And how are you feeling,

28:18.130 --> 28:19.298
Captain Fantastic?

28:19.398 --> 28:20.933
I'm fine.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.034
Yeah, I bet you're fine.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.269
Let's not discuss it.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.771
You don't want to discuss

28:24.771 --> 28:25.938
the mushrooms you did?
Shh. Todd.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.607
Wait, you did mushrooms?
Okay.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.109
It-it was an accident.
Oh. Todd, Todd, Todd.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.510
Allison, Todd, stop it.

28:31.610 --> 28:32.779
I'll see you. Thank you.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.146
Hello.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.815
What a lovely table setting.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.483
Why don't we eat now?

28:37.583 --> 28:39.118
Yes, yes, good. Everyone eat.
Yes. Oh, yes, uh, we should eat.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.420
Uh, bon appétit. Mm.

28:41.520 --> 28:45.491
Uh, this-this brisket
is from my caterer Cesar.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.960
Mm. Oh, and the wine.
The wine is

28:48.060 --> 28:49.528
a lovely pinot.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.297
Just, the organization...

28:51.397 --> 28:53.532
From Willamette Valley. Uh...

28:55.601 --> 28:57.603
Well, cheers.

28:57.703 --> 28:58.604
Cheers, Mom. Cheers.

28:58.704 --> 28:59.806
Cheers.
Cheers.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.140
Thank you.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.109
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.576
Uh, governor.

29:04.676 --> 29:05.912
Cheers.
Cheers.

29:06.012 --> 29:08.047
Oh. Heavenly.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.082
So. My sister.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.618
Her arrest is very upsetting.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.620
Drugs. Again.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.489
And I need to cut her loose.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.191
Uh, wait, wait.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.493
I-I know this situation
is-is very challenging,

29:21.593 --> 29:24.396
but your sister did a drug test
and she tested clean.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.199
Someone is trying
to take the land, or...

29:27.299 --> 29:29.435
Or she's clean now,
but last week

29:29.535 --> 29:31.670
she was lost
in a drug-induced paranoia.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.840
Seeing things? Colors?
Lights in the sky?

29:33.840 --> 29:35.641
No, no, no,
that was just the drones.
I don't care.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.176
I don't want to know.
No, believe me, I thought

29:37.276 --> 29:38.911
it was aliens, too, at first.
Thank you.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.446
But I've dealt with this before.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.315
I can't trust her.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.852
I'm done.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.620
Please... Madam...

29:48.720 --> 29:50.556
Willa.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.160
Our siblings are the only ones

29:54.260 --> 29:55.962
who've known us our whole lives.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.663
They know
what we've been through.

29:57.763 --> 30:00.132
And-and they see parts of us
that no one else sees.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.701
It is worth the effort to...

30:02.801 --> 30:05.537
accept and-and forgive them.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.807
No.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.609
I've made up my mind.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.511
And I need
to distance myself from her.

30:12.611 --> 30:15.614
Can you draw up the papers
separating me from the land?

30:15.714 --> 30:17.583
Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.

30:17.683 --> 30:20.019
Thank you.
The sooner the better.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.255
Oh. I'm sorry.

30:23.355 --> 30:26.392
Governor, there's been
a situation.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.693
Hmm.

30:27.793 --> 30:29.295
I'm so sorry, Mom.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.066
But I am going to continue

30:34.166 --> 30:35.601
to represent your sister.

30:35.701 --> 30:36.835
I want to protect her

30:36.936 --> 30:38.704
and her farm.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.772
I see.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.844
Thank you for a lovely evening.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.413
Yes, of course.

30:49.715 --> 30:50.849
Cesar is incredible.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.618
Not gonna finish your brisket?

30:52.718 --> 30:55.287
Lawrence, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.323
Mother.
What?

30:57.423 --> 30:59.358
Oh, gentlemen,
I had a plate for you as well,

30:59.458 --> 31:01.460
but don't worry about it.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.462
What the hell was that?

31:03.562 --> 31:05.064
My gosh!
Also, did you notice

31:05.164 --> 31:06.933
she was wearing the exact
same scarf that I gave you?

31:07.033 --> 31:09.601
Yes. Yes. I didn't want
to say anything. Hey,

31:09.701 --> 31:11.938
in other news,
Lyle just texted me some info

31:12.038 --> 31:13.205
that he got
from the drone's SD card.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.840
He has the flight path.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.275
What does that mean? Oh.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.110
We know where
the drone originated from.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.778
Mm-hmm.
And where exactly is that?

31:19.946 --> 31:23.282
About a mile off Debby's farm,
right here.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.817
Okay. We're going.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.586
Right now. Right?
Now?

31:27.686 --> 31:29.355
Yes, but I'm gonna change first,
but then we're gonna go.

31:29.455 --> 31:30.957
And show her.
Okay, great, yeah.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.391
I'm gonna finish my plate first,
but, yeah, then we'll go.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.526
What a lovely evening.
Mm-hmm.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.532
Are you sure
this is the right way?

31:40.632 --> 31:41.968
We are going toward the
coordinates that Lyle gave us.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.403
Yeah.
This is definitely
not Debby's land.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.138
Hmm.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.673
Why are you walking
like that?

31:47.773 --> 31:49.041
Like what?

31:49.141 --> 31:51.010
Like a mime in a cloud--
all dramatic and weird.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.544
You look like a mummy.

31:52.644 --> 31:55.214
It is dark, Todd. I can
barely see where I'm going.

31:55.314 --> 31:56.782
What do the coordinates say?

31:56.882 --> 32:00.552
Well, it should be
right over...

32:01.553 --> 32:03.255
Bingo.

32:04.056 --> 32:07.026
Okay...

32:07.126 --> 32:08.360
Why are you pushing me now?

32:08.460 --> 32:09.996
Just, so, move, we both go in. Okay.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.764
Squirrel Be Gone?

32:12.864 --> 32:15.001
Didn't you say somebody
was leaving dead squirrels

32:15.001 --> 32:16.202
on Debby's property?

32:16.302 --> 32:19.038
Yes.
How can people be so cruel?

32:19.138 --> 32:20.172
I don't know.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.474
Look. Bathrobes.

32:24.010 --> 32:27.046
What is this, some sort of
weird bathing cult or something?

32:27.146 --> 32:29.181
Whoa. Hold on a second.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.151
Um...

32:32.251 --> 32:33.585
Pills?

32:33.685 --> 32:35.254
Todd, those were just like
the pills found

32:35.354 --> 32:36.822
on Debby's property
after the fire.

32:36.922 --> 32:39.025
Huh.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.929
It's another drone.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.898
Drones, drugs, Debby?

32:47.033 --> 32:48.467
Wait. Hold on.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.203
Todd.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.273
McMindville Resort Spa,

32:54.373 --> 32:56.275
Lucea Operating Systems, LLC, Jamaica.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.643
Todd, this is the company

32:57.743 --> 32:59.178
that put the lien
on Debby's property.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.479
Yeah.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.048
Put your hands up.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.249
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Now.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.516
Can-can we just talk?

33:04.616 --> 33:06.718
Shut up! Start walking.
All right.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.687
Okay.
He said shut up. Just shut up.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.090
Faster.
Yeah, we are.
We're coming.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.958
You, over here.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.693
Okay, I guess
I'm over here, right?
No, no!

33:14.793 --> 33:16.462
Lawyer lady, you tie him up. Okay.

33:16.562 --> 33:17.863
What?
Okay.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.598
You're gonna have my mom
tie me up?

33:19.698 --> 33:21.467
Just shut up.
Okay, Todd.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.169
This is embarrassing.
Start recording.

33:23.269 --> 33:24.970
What?
Just start recording.
Just do it.

33:25.071 --> 33:27.806
Oh. Okay. I'm-I'm tying him up.
I'm tying him up.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.508
Ow.
I just...
Loop-di-loop, this is...

33:29.608 --> 33:32.644
Tighter!
I'm going tighter.
There. Okay? Done.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.314
Put her over there. Tie her up.
Watch your tone.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.183
Watch my tone?

33:37.283 --> 33:39.151
Oh, my God. Okay.

33:41.287 --> 33:46.625
Okay. Hi. Sarah and Joe,
uh, you don't have to do this.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.327
Who are Joe and Sarah?
Oh, come on, guys.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.596
We're not gonna play the "who
are Joe and Sarah" game, are we?

33:50.696 --> 33:52.131
You just called her
lawyer lady.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.400
We saw your spa concepts
on the wall over there.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.635
You two have big dreams,
don't you?

33:56.735 --> 33:59.105
But your plans
aren't working out.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.107
What...

34:01.107 --> 34:03.375
what are you doing?
Joe didn't listen to me.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.477
The mushrooms
wouldn't grow on our land.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.579
So, you went after
Debby's property.

34:07.679 --> 34:08.947
Well, we tried to buy her out,

34:09.115 --> 34:10.649
but she wouldn't
agree to anything.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.251
Holy crap, Sarah.
Stop talking.

34:12.351 --> 34:13.885
No, no, no, no, Sarah,
actually, maybe keep talking.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.122
You are so
incredibly annoying.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.456
Me?
Him!

34:17.556 --> 34:18.424
Okay!
Just, you don't have to gesture

34:18.524 --> 34:20.025
with the gun every time.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.160
Go get the tarp.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.261
Tarp?
Please.

34:22.361 --> 34:23.462
No, no.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.197
<i>Please</i> go get the tarp.
No, no tarp.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.600
What's the tarp even for?

34:28.700 --> 34:30.136
So we don't make a mess.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.239
Mom.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.975
On your knees.
Okay. Okay, we're serious.
We're going down. Okay.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.910
I'm sorry. Before you start
all the shooting stuff, I have

34:39.010 --> 34:41.147
one more question for you,
because, you know,

34:41.247 --> 34:42.214
I am a detail-oriented person.

34:42.314 --> 34:43.882
I mean, always have been, and if

34:43.982 --> 34:46.785
I don't know the rest
of the story before I, uh, die,

34:46.885 --> 34:49.355
uh, it will just keep
nagging at me.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.490
So, you couldn't grow mushrooms,

34:51.590 --> 34:53.825
so you went after
Debby's property.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.462
That's right. Someone left
a dead squirrel in her house.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.029
But she wouldn't
make a deal with you,

34:58.164 --> 34:59.931
so, you took out a lien
against her land

35:00.031 --> 35:03.369
with a Jamaican shell corp,
and then, you started

35:03.469 --> 35:05.036
harassing her with drones.

35:05.171 --> 35:06.672
Help me.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.174
Yeah, yeah, and I feel like

35:08.174 --> 35:09.641
the squirrel stuff was
taking it a step too far.

35:09.741 --> 35:10.709
Yes, yes, a step too far.

35:10.809 --> 35:11.743
Well, everything went sideways

35:11.843 --> 35:13.078
because of Joe.

35:13.179 --> 35:14.546
You don't owe them
an explanation.

35:14.646 --> 35:15.681
They're about to be dead.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.317
What?
Wait. You're not

35:18.417 --> 35:20.452
actually gonna kill them.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Sarah.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.288
Come on. This isn't you.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.889
I mean, what happened to
the whole psilocybe tribe vibe?

35:23.989 --> 35:25.791
I mean, whatever happened
to loving people

35:25.891 --> 35:28.927
from the inside?
Yeah, Joe. I don't
want to kill them.

35:29.027 --> 35:31.029
What do you think
we were gonna do?
I thought

35:31.197 --> 35:33.532
we were just scaring them.
You were wrong.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.901
Aah!
No!

35:36.001 --> 35:38.103
Hey!

35:43.542 --> 35:45.110
Namaste!

35:45.211 --> 35:48.347
Double-O-Lyle
strikes again.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.715
You okay, Mother?

35:49.815 --> 35:51.317
That was incredible.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.219
Could someone untie me?

35:56.588 --> 35:58.790
Sorry that took so long, Mother.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.427
I never doubted for a second.
You're an ex-Marine.

36:01.527 --> 36:04.230
That was awesome. How did you
even know where we were?

36:04.230 --> 36:06.732
Well, I dropped a pin to both
of them on our way over.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.066
You know how
to drop a pin?

36:08.234 --> 36:09.868
Well, of course, Todd.

36:09.968 --> 36:12.338
Do you think I haven't
learned anything from you?

36:12.438 --> 36:14.406
Okay, well,

36:14.506 --> 36:18.009
I guess we all have me to thank
for saving the day then, right?

36:18.109 --> 36:20.246
God.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.147
<i>Mr. Ben Cooper,</i>

36:22.248 --> 36:25.083
what do you know
about the meth found

36:25.251 --> 36:26.618
underneath Ms. Jones'
hunting blind?

36:26.718 --> 36:28.019
I know it wasn't Ms. Jones'.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.655
How do you know that?

36:29.755 --> 36:32.424
After you came to my trailer, I
started to worry that Ms. Jones

36:32.524 --> 36:33.625
was in trouble.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.060
That's when I heard
some weird sounds

36:35.160 --> 36:37.396
out by the blind.
When I went to check them out,

36:37.496 --> 36:41.032
I saw Joe putting green bags
into a metal box

36:41.132 --> 36:44.670
right before the same green bags
were found in Debby's blind.

36:44.770 --> 36:48.073
They were out to get Debby
and her land.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.680
No further questions,
Your Honor.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.648
The witness is excused.

36:56.748 --> 36:59.818
Your Honor, in light
of this testimony

36:59.918 --> 37:02.288
and the evidence presented,
the State wishes

37:02.288 --> 37:04.723
to dismiss the charges
against the defendant.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.024
The Court accepts.

37:06.124 --> 37:08.727
<i>State of Oregon v. Debby Jones</i>

37:08.827 --> 37:10.762
is dismissed.

37:10.862 --> 37:15.501
Next on the calendar,
<i>State of Oregon v.</i>

37:15.601 --> 37:17.536
<i>Joe and Sarah Graham.</i>

37:22.674 --> 37:24.209
I'm proud of you.

37:24.310 --> 37:27.713
Thanks. Trying.
Mm-hmm.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.582
Well, we can work out a deal
where you can stay on the land.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.083
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

37:32.183 --> 37:33.752
You just have
to come by my office this time

37:33.852 --> 37:35.887
and sign a lease. Okay.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.024
Take care.
You, too.

37:41.327 --> 37:43.829
I heard you were
third battalion 25th?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.364
Yeah.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.032
Second Marines,
Operation Matador.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.801
We came in right
behind you guys.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.103
Right on.
That was a heavy duty, uh...

37:52.203 --> 37:55.140
Yup. Yeah, it sure was.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.209
Uh, my mom says you've been
through a rough patch.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.346
Let me know
if there's anything I can do

38:00.346 --> 38:02.614
to help you
pull things back together.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.585
Semper fi.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.654
Semper fi.

38:11.156 --> 38:13.525
Thank you.
Oh, of course.

38:13.625 --> 38:17.529
The land is yours again.
Yours... and your sister's,

38:17.629 --> 38:20.466
should you want
to continue to co-own it.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.101
Willa, I'm so sorry.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.236
I let a mistake you made
in the past

38:25.371 --> 38:27.072
cloud my judgment of you today.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.474
I'm sorry.

38:28.574 --> 38:32.744
We should try harder,
the two of us.

38:34.513 --> 38:37.816
Someday, you will be governor.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.552
A big, pink governor.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.457
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold the elevator, please! Hold.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.393
Hey. Oh. Thanks.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.861
Just in time. Again. Yeah.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.930
Well, thank you again.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.801
So, how was it
working with Lawrence?

38:55.901 --> 38:58.970
Uh, it was... fine... ish.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.306
Yeah?
No, it was good.

39:01.407 --> 39:04.976
It was, um... it was actually
really nice. He gave me

39:05.076 --> 39:06.412
these little pincer scissors,

39:06.512 --> 39:07.879
this little mini-
Leatherman thing. Hmm.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.449
So I could pince my way
out of any situation.

39:10.549 --> 39:11.883
Do you know
I got zip-tied the other day?

39:11.983 --> 39:14.753
No way.
Yeah, it really <i>pinced</i> me off.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.924
And now we've helped
the governor,

39:19.024 --> 39:20.492
which is, like, a total
"get out of jail free" card

39:20.592 --> 39:22.628
