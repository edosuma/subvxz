-Yes! Yes! What's up? How are you?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.074
-[continued cheering]
-All right.

01:14.866 --> 01:15.700
Good.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.912
Me too. Me... Aw, I said, "Me too".

01:18.995 --> 01:20.538
-Okay, shit.
-[laughter]

01:20.997 --> 01:23.625
Damn it! I have to tell my story now.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.503
Real quick. This is no way
to start a comedy show, clearly.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.712
Let me get it out of the way.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.799
I have a Me Too story,
every woman in the business does.

01:30.882 --> 01:34.928
A guy that I worked with and trusted
did something pretty gross to me.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.347
And it was backstage one night
before a show,

01:37.430 --> 01:41.935
we were hanging out in his green room
and he got up to shut the door,

01:42.352 --> 01:45.563
which is fine, I thought we were going
to smoke pot or something, and then...

01:45.647 --> 01:46.815
And then he locked it

01:46.898 --> 01:49.567
and that's when I was like,
"Wait, what?" And then...

01:49.943 --> 01:51.945
He proceeded to then turn around...

01:52.028 --> 01:54.697
and expose himself to me...

01:55.115 --> 01:56.866
-emotionally. He started crying
-[laughter]

01:56.950 --> 01:59.744
and it was one of
the most disgusting things

02:00.411 --> 02:01.913
I've ever seen a man do.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.167
I didn't know what to do. I froze.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.295
I was just like, "Hey, can you take
your dick out so I have somewhere to look?

02:09.379 --> 02:11.589
'Cause I don't know what's going on
with your face.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.967
It's wet and red
and I don't understand it.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.593
So be a man right now...

02:16.636 --> 02:18.888
-and take your dick out, okay?"
-[audience laughs]

02:19.848 --> 02:23.268
'Cause at least that I've seen before.
I know...

02:23.351 --> 02:25.395
That's old hat at this point.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.521
[laughing]

02:26.729 --> 02:28.189
There's a protocol for that.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.734
If a guy takes his dick out and you don't
want to see it and you're uncomfortable,

02:31.818 --> 02:32.819
you know what to do.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.737
You just kind of, like, go...
[laughs nervously]

02:34.821 --> 02:36.573
-You just kind of laugh nervously,
-[laughter]

02:36.656 --> 02:39.868
and kind of back out of the room
and then go, "Okay," and shut the door

02:39.951 --> 02:42.162
and then get blacklisted
from the industry.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.539
-[audience laughs]
-So there's a system in place...

02:44.747 --> 02:45.957
[applause]

02:47.876 --> 02:49.043
I...

02:49.752 --> 02:52.672
[stammers] So I'm... I do actually have
a story about someone

02:52.755 --> 02:55.633
and I would love-- When everyone
was coming out with they're stories,

02:55.717 --> 02:58.887
I was like, "I want to tell it so bad,"
but I can't because I asked around

02:58.970 --> 03:00.972
and he, like, only did it to me,

03:01.055 --> 03:02.557
'cause I'm, like, so pretty.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.142
-[audience laughs]
-I guess that's why.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.351
That's why they do it, girls.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.062
When a guy does something gross
to you that you don't want him to do,

03:08.146 --> 03:11.274
it's because you're so pretty
he couldn't help himself, right?

03:11.524 --> 03:14.027
So, when you go talking about it,

03:14.110 --> 03:16.988
and telling people,
it's like, you're kind of bragging.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.406
-Like...
-[laughter]

03:18.823 --> 03:21.534
"Take it to the grave.
We get it, you know you're pretty."

03:21.618 --> 03:22.493
So...

03:22.660 --> 03:23.786
[continued laughter]

03:23.870 --> 03:26.915
It's true. When you're one woman
with one story against one man,

03:26.998 --> 03:27.957
you really have nothing.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.835
You're what the legal system calls,
and I think it's Latin, but it's...

03:30.919 --> 03:33.463
-"lying whore," I think is what it is.
-[uproarious laughter]

03:34.881 --> 03:35.882
[applause]

03:36.257 --> 03:37.091
And so...

03:38.051 --> 03:40.136
Yeah, until I find
at least six other women

03:40.220 --> 03:42.263
with the same exact story against him...

03:42.722 --> 03:43.932
keep enjoying his podcast.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.808
-[Nikki laughs]
-[audience oohs]

03:46.226 --> 03:47.685
Yeah, you love it.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.146
They all have one,
it doesn't whittle it down.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.607
-Not even in the slightest. So...
-[cheering]

03:53.650 --> 03:57.278
I'm single and, like, I just, like,
don't want to be anymore.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.031
I just... I want a boyfriend so bad.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.742
I really... and I know
you're not supposed to say that.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.452
I'm reading all these books right now

04:04.535 --> 04:07.622
about how to trick a man into loving you
and...

04:07.705 --> 04:09.457
-[laughter]
-You know the titles,

04:09.540 --> 04:12.335
they're, like, you know,
always written in, like, angry lipstick

04:12.418 --> 04:15.213
-or period blood and it's just like...
-[continued laughter]

04:15.546 --> 04:18.299
[gruff] <i>Why Men Love Bitches,</i> or like...

04:18.633 --> 04:19.884
<i>Getting to I Do.</i>

04:19.968 --> 04:22.720
I'm reading one right now, it's good,
I'm in the middle of it,

04:22.804 --> 04:25.098
it's called <i>Fake It Till You Kill Yourself</i>

04:25.181 --> 04:27.183
-[audience laughs]
-and I can't wait to finish it

04:27.642 --> 04:30.979
because I'm so exhausted
with being single.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.773
The books say,
"Don't say you want a boyfriend."

04:33.982 --> 04:36.693
-I know I already fucked that up.
-[laughing]

04:37.151 --> 04:40.154
They definitely say don't talk about it
into microphones on

04:40.822 --> 04:43.950
globally streaming platform services,
but...

04:44.450 --> 04:45.410
I want a boyfriend.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.079
And another rule, ladies, listen up.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.708
Second rule is look fuckable all the time.
All the time.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.544
Look fuckable...
I have to wear makeup all the time now.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.297
And I know you guys are like,
"Oh no, Nikki, you're beautiful."

04:57.380 --> 04:59.924
And it's like, "I know. I know."
Without makeup...

05:00.008 --> 05:01.384
I am a beautiful man.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.637
Without makeup, I look like
a yoga instructor named Jesper.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.098
-[laughing]
-That's kind of my vibe.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.019
I can't risk going out without makeup.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.895
Are you joking me? I'm single.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.105
That's the thing...

05:14.188 --> 05:16.232
[stammers] Whenever I throw my hair up
in a bun...

05:16.316 --> 05:18.234
First of all, it's a man bun now.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.944
-Like, men own buns.
-[audience laughs]

05:20.236 --> 05:23.573
You guys have stolen the most fun,
easy style from us.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.700
I can't wear my hair in a bun.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.202
The only safe style for a woman now,

05:28.286 --> 05:30.371
when you wear your hair up,
is a high ponytail.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.498
-Don't you dare take that from us.
-[laughter]

05:32.582 --> 05:34.292
Don't you dare! I'm serious.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.543
Buns aren't safe anymore.

05:35.626 --> 05:36.711
Keep the high pone.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.630
If I ever wear a low pone...
Low pones have never been safe.

05:39.714 --> 05:43.009
When I wear a low pone without makeup,
I look like Beethoven.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.720
-[uproarious laughter]
-That hasn't been mine for centuries.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.681
[woman cackles]

05:48.848 --> 05:50.975
I swear to God.
You have to wear makeup all the time.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.270
If you're single, do not leave the house
without... If I see a girl without makeup,

05:54.354 --> 05:56.647
I always am just like,
"Oh my God, someone loves her."

05:56.731 --> 05:59.275
-[audience laughs]
-That is so... What is that like?

06:03.237 --> 06:05.615
It's not feminist to say this, it isn't,

06:05.698 --> 06:09.118
but it's, like, do you expect to find...
What if you're in line at the drugstore,

06:09.202 --> 06:12.455
and your soulmate is in line next to you,
the guy that you're meant to be with,

06:12.538 --> 06:15.208
and you don't have makeup on
and you don't have a hot outfit on?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.710
How is he supposed to know
every best trait that you have

06:17.794 --> 06:19.879
that aren't your looks?
'Cause I know you have a lot.

06:19.962 --> 06:23.174
I have tons. I have the Gisele Bundchen
of personalities,

06:23.257 --> 06:26.219
but it doesn't mean shit
unless I draw shadows on my face

06:26.302 --> 06:29.180
to make it look like I have bone structure
I do not have.

06:29.263 --> 06:30.515
[laughter]

06:30.848 --> 06:34.727
He's not going to look at me
with my man face and my hair up in a bun

06:34.811 --> 06:36.646
and just know that I'm loyal,

06:36.729 --> 06:38.398
I'm funny, I do anal,

06:38.481 --> 06:41.067
-like, all of my best...
-[laughing and cheering]

06:41.192 --> 06:43.111
That's stuff that comes out later.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.404
You get it.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.781
[continued laughter]

06:47.115 --> 06:50.535
So if I ever go out without makeup,
'cause you want to let your skin breathe,

06:50.618 --> 06:52.620
I always have to wear my "I Do Anal" shirt

06:52.703 --> 06:54.080
-and that's just like...
-[laughing]

06:54.163 --> 06:58.084
That catches the eye, but it's always
in the wash, you know, 'cause...

06:59.252 --> 07:00.753
-[laughter]
-[Nikki sighs]

07:02.797 --> 07:04.173
I'm such a whore.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.467
That's why I want a boyfriend.
Can I be clear about this?

07:06.551 --> 07:09.220
I don't want a boyfriend 'cause I want
to get married and settle in.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.390
I want a boyfriend so I can feel safe
being a whore again.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.767
-That's what I want. I really just...
-[laughter]

07:14.851 --> 07:17.478
I want a guy
to date me for a couple months

07:17.562 --> 07:21.357
so I can feel safe to get let out
of my whore cage a little bit.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.901
And then put back into one
'cause that's what I'm into.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.195
-I really... I can't do this anymore.
-[laughing]

07:26.279 --> 07:28.114
I can't casually hook up anymore.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.408
It hurts too much to hook up with a guy.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.243
I can't stand it when you cum in my mouth

07:32.326 --> 07:35.329
and then you stop watching
my Instagram story the next day.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.039
-[uproarious laughter]
-Why'd you drop off?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.584
-You watched it before!
-[applause]

07:40.001 --> 07:41.002
What happened?

07:42.128 --> 07:45.047
[groans] Is there anything more pathetic,
the next day,

07:45.131 --> 07:48.134
when you're trying to wait for that guy
to watch your story again

07:48.217 --> 07:50.386
and you post one, you're like,
"Hey, guys."

07:50.470 --> 07:54.307
But you're really being like, "Hey,
guy that I'm waiting to watch this."

07:54.390 --> 07:56.309
And you like touch your mouth
to remind him

07:56.392 --> 07:58.394
-where his dick was hours before.
-[audience laughs]

07:58.478 --> 08:00.104
You're like, [nasally] "Hey."

08:00.730 --> 08:02.940
And then you're just refreshing,
waiting for him

08:03.024 --> 08:05.735
and then your dad DM's you like,
[dopey] "Killing it, Nik!"

08:05.818 --> 08:08.196
-And you're just like, "Not now, Dad!"
-[uproarious laughter]

08:08.654 --> 08:09.655
[laughing] God!

08:09.822 --> 08:10.907
[audience whoos and laughs]

08:11.782 --> 08:13.576
He's like,
"What did you have for breakfast?"

08:13.659 --> 08:16.037
And I'm like,
"Do you really want to know, Dad?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.622
[laughter]

08:17.955 --> 08:21.751
An ounce of cum and half a Kind bar, okay?
That is exactly..."

08:21.918 --> 08:23.252
[continued laughter]

08:24.378 --> 08:27.006
"A Kind bar and a mean load, Dad."

08:27.089 --> 08:28.508
[laughing]

08:28.841 --> 08:31.469
"What flavor? Mixed nuts. What else, Dad?"

08:32.637 --> 08:33.554
I'm just...

08:33.721 --> 08:36.182
I just want to be a whore. I really do.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.225
I am such a whore,

08:37.308 --> 08:39.977
but outside of a relationship,
I don't feel safe being a whore.

08:40.061 --> 08:40.895
I really don't.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.146
And for a while I was like,

08:42.230 --> 08:44.732
"Maybe if I don't have sex,
maybe if I don't let them in my puss,

08:44.815 --> 08:46.984
I won't get attached.
Maybe if I just blow guys."

08:47.068 --> 08:50.279
So I was blowing guys
and that's not safe either, girls.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.658
There's something about their dick, it's
like closer to your heart or something.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.326
-[audience laughs]
-It's just... It...

08:56.661 --> 08:57.703
I go crazy.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.668
Hand jobs? Hand jobs are all I have
to get a guy off?

09:03.751 --> 09:07.463
No, thank you. I'm terrible at hand jobs.
I'm bad at hand jobs and guitar.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.548
I know that about myself.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.341
-[laughter]
-I have bad rhythm...

09:10.424 --> 09:12.927
I want to be good at guitar so bad.
I've taken so many lessons

09:13.010 --> 09:15.930
and every guitar lesson has gone
like every hand job I've ever given.

09:16.013 --> 09:16.931
It really has.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.267
I'm, like, in a guy's studio apartment,

09:19.350 --> 09:20.851
he's showing me a strumming pattern,

09:20.935 --> 09:22.812
I feel like I'm doing a good job,

09:22.895 --> 09:24.814
and eventually he's like,
"Let's do it together."

09:24.897 --> 09:25.856
And I'm like, "Okay,"

09:25.940 --> 09:27.692
-[laughing]
-and then we're doing it together.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.360
And I'm like, "All right, we're jamming."

09:29.443 --> 09:31.237
Then he's like,
"Why don't you just watch me?"

09:31.320 --> 09:32.822
I'm like, "Okay, I'm out. I don't care.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.825
I am not good at this, so I'm going
to wait for my mom to pick me up."

09:35.908 --> 09:37.243
[audience laughs and cheers]

09:37.451 --> 09:39.579
-And then he cums on me.
-[continued laughter]

09:40.037 --> 09:42.290
'Cause that's how I used to pay
for my guitar lessons.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.042
I mean that was before Venmo.
It was a different time.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.588
So you know what I'm doing?

09:48.671 --> 09:51.799
'Cause I need to get a good old
dicking down sometimes.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.260
I need a dick in me. It feels great.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.638
Even lesbians will attest to the fact
that dicks feel amazing in you.

09:57.722 --> 10:01.225
They use a meat substitute,
but they're getting stuff, too.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.268
[laughing]

10:02.351 --> 10:04.437
So when I need dick, I go back to my ex.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.523
I go sleep with my ex and everyone's like,
"Don't do that, Nikki.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.649
Don't go back to your ex."

10:08.733 --> 10:11.193
It's not 'cause I'm weak.
It's 'cause I break up with him,

10:11.277 --> 10:13.404
and then I go date other guys
and I look back at him

10:13.487 --> 10:15.448
and I'm like, "Oh, he was the best...

10:15.531 --> 10:16.449
I can do."

10:16.532 --> 10:19.785
-Like, I just can't get better.
-[audience laughs]

10:20.036 --> 10:21.996
And so I sleep with him and it's easy.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.832
I don't want to get back together
with him. So I just don't even care.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.460
I can show up...
It's like an oil change, I feel like.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.754
-[laughter]
-I'm in and out in a half hour.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.047
We bang it out.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.132
He slaps a sticker on my forehead
at the end of it,

10:33.215 --> 10:34.592
writes a date with a Sharpie on it,

10:34.675 --> 10:37.136
"Back in four months if I haven't found
someone to love me."

10:37.803 --> 10:38.763
[laughing]

10:39.055 --> 10:40.056
I don't have to dress up.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.350
I'm not like, "I need to look..."
I don't shave my legs.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.768
I can, like, wear no makeup.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.311
I can be on my period.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.855
Be like, "It just started,"
even though it's, like, full swing,

10:47.938 --> 10:50.900
-You know, like, I just lie. [laughs]
-[uproarious laughter]

10:53.319 --> 10:55.780
He pulls out a tampon
and he's like, "Really?" And I'm like...

10:55.863 --> 10:57.114
-"Ah...
-[laughing]

10:57.323 --> 10:58.783
That's from last month.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.577
Is that worse than me lying to you?"

11:03.579 --> 11:05.456
[pained] I just want to be a slut.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.457
Like, it sucks.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.711
For the past fucking six years,
I've slept with one person.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.547
And I'm, like, kind of known
as like, "You're, like, a slutty comic,"

11:13.631 --> 11:16.300
'cause all I talk about is sex,
and I want to be so bad.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.095
My ex-boyfriend, by the way,
has all of my naked pictures,

11:19.178 --> 11:20.346
all of my best videos,

11:20.429 --> 11:22.682
anytime I'm feeling myself,
I ship one off to him.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.934
And I know I shouldn't,
the cloud is insecure,

11:25.017 --> 11:26.185
but neither am I...

11:26.268 --> 11:28.938
-[audience laughs]
-and I need constant validation...

11:29.522 --> 11:30.773
that I'm hot.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.900
So I checked with him recently.

11:32.983 --> 11:37.530
I was like, "Hey, have you ever shown
anyone any of those pictures, ever?"

11:37.613 --> 11:39.990
And he was like, "No, you know
that I wouldn't do that.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.909
You can trust me." And I was like,

11:42.326 --> 11:44.412
-"Could you? Because I really...
-[laughing]

11:44.995 --> 11:47.623
Could you schedule a leak
that I can seem upset about?"

11:47.707 --> 11:49.458
Because I need to get the word out.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.753
You need to get the word out. When you're
a chick who wants to be seen as fuckable

11:52.837 --> 11:56.090
and wants to, you know, let guys know,
"Hey, I'm available."

11:56.173 --> 11:58.509
You put out thirst traps,
but it's really...

11:58.592 --> 12:00.678
You can't...
You gotta be very delicate about it.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.139
You can't be one of these girls
that's just like, "I'm hot."

12:03.222 --> 12:06.809
Like, you can't... The only girls we let
do that are pornstars and supermodels,

12:06.892 --> 12:08.644
where you can just have
your labia hanging out

12:08.728 --> 12:11.480
and be like, "Rock the vote!"
And everyone's like, "Go girl!"

12:11.564 --> 12:12.690
-[laughter]
-Like...

12:13.149 --> 12:16.068
You can't just be a normal girl
just being like, "I'm hot."

12:16.152 --> 12:17.319
Because then what happens?

12:17.403 --> 12:20.448
Your girlfriends screenshot it, and they
start a text conversation about you

12:20.531 --> 12:21.907
being like, "She thinks she's hot,"

12:21.991 --> 12:24.118
and I only know that because I do it

12:24.201 --> 12:25.077
to other girls,

12:25.161 --> 12:27.037
-[laughter]
-'cause I'm jealous of your...

12:27.121 --> 12:29.915
I'm just too insecure
to just put it out there.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.418
So you got to like, you know,
group it with something else.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.336
You always have to have an excuse
to be hot.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.089
You can't just be. You have to be like,
"Happy birthday, Grandma!"

12:37.173 --> 12:41.177
And then shove your tits
next to your grandmother's decaying head.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.137
-[laughing]
-Be like, "Grandma!"

12:43.846 --> 12:45.723
"Pool party for Grandma's birthday."

12:45.806 --> 12:48.142
[infantile] "Grandma, why'd you make me
wear this?"

12:48.225 --> 12:49.059
[laughter]

12:49.935 --> 12:51.061
"Grandma.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.315
Grandma...
Coachella with Grandma, dialysis tent!"

12:54.398 --> 12:58.110
-[laughing]
-She's just like, "My melanoma, Stacy,

12:58.194 --> 12:59.570
get me out of the sun.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.907
I'm thirsty."

13:02.990 --> 13:04.909
I'm just like, "So am I, Grandma. Smile."

13:04.992 --> 13:07.119
[laughter and applause]

13:09.038 --> 13:10.956
You can't just be!

13:11.123 --> 13:12.958
You have to have an excuse to be hot.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.919
I mean, we used to have Halloween.
Remember that?

13:15.002 --> 13:16.295
When we had Halloween?

13:16.378 --> 13:20.257
Until every stand-up comedian since 1995
wrote a joke about like,

13:20.341 --> 13:22.802
[oafish] "Have you ever noticed
girls use Halloween

13:22.885 --> 13:25.638
as an excuse to dress like sluts?"
[indistinct groaning]

13:25.763 --> 13:27.765
[yelling] Yeah! I think I did!

13:27.848 --> 13:28.808
[audience laughs]

13:29.850 --> 13:31.977
I used to look forward to it

13:32.061 --> 13:34.104
and plan for it and prepare for it.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.398
But now because of you,
you've drawn attention to it.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.525
So everyone knows.

13:37.608 --> 13:41.278
So the only girls that get to dress
like sluts on Halloween are actual sluts,

13:41.362 --> 13:44.156
and girls like me...
I have to be like, "I'm a mailbox!"

13:44.240 --> 13:46.450
-[laughter]
-And like walk into a party...

13:46.534 --> 13:50.746
with a big, cumbersome, cardboard box.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.709
I'm like, "Why did I plank for two months?
What was the purpose of this?"

13:56.335 --> 13:57.878
Just let me be a slut.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.339
Let me fix my dress. Okay.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.843
So, a year ago,
I was on the reality dance competition

14:03.926 --> 14:06.303
<i>Dancing with the Stars</i> season 27,

14:06.679 --> 14:07.596
-and...
-[laughing]

14:07.680 --> 14:09.890
It's a real number. I know it seems fake.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.768
It's been on since 1943, apparently.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.230
I was so honored to be asked

14:16.313 --> 14:18.566
and if you don't know, I got first...

14:18.941 --> 14:21.068
-voted off. So, that was...
-[laughing]

14:22.111 --> 14:23.487
-[man whoos]
-Yeah.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.073
Devastating. Didn't see it coming.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.409
Okay, I'm not a good dancer,
I knew I wouldn't win,

14:28.492 --> 14:30.995
I just didn't think I would be
first voted off.

14:31.078 --> 14:34.373
Mostly 'cause there was a blind woman
on the show,

14:34.456 --> 14:36.083
-[laughing]
-so I thought maybe... [laughs]

14:37.835 --> 14:42.548
I'll be second. But, I was
a worse dancer than a blind woman...

14:42.923 --> 14:43.883
and her dog.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.427
It was just the way it was.

14:47.219 --> 14:51.849
That bitch made it to the semis and...
the dog, and I...

14:52.725 --> 14:54.935
It was... The show was amazing.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.479
I almost didn't do the show
because I can't dance,

14:57.563 --> 14:58.689
to be honest with you.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.650
I... I've never danced,
I find it humiliating,

15:01.734 --> 15:04.236
which is weird for me
because it's hard to make me embarrassed.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.573
Like, I can stand up here and talk to you
about my vagina at length,

15:07.656 --> 15:10.784
but like... Not about the length
of my vagina, but it's...

15:10.868 --> 15:12.244
[audience laughs]

15:13.162 --> 15:16.999
It's like two inches clit to slit if we're
really getting down to brass tacks, but...

15:19.126 --> 15:20.002
But...

15:20.377 --> 15:21.462
You see, sir.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.590
-[uproarious laughter]
-It's just... I apologize.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.219
I'm Me Too-ing you right now.
You did not ask for this,

15:29.845 --> 15:31.221
but you're getting it.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.765
Oh, God...

15:33.891 --> 15:38.646
[laughs] I... Yeah, I didn't want to do it
'cause I can't dance.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.940
I've never been able to dance.
I don't dance at concerts.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.359
I don't dance at weddings.
I don't dance at funerals.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.944
-I...
-[laughter]

15:45.194 --> 15:48.030
I'm reluctant to dance alone
in my own apartment, truly.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.658
I just... I'm always scared
that there might be some intruder

15:50.741 --> 15:53.869
watching me through the closet,
just, like, kind of judging me.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.912
Like... [groans]

15:54.995 --> 15:56.872
And he sees me, like, bust a move

15:56.956 --> 15:58.999
and then he just murders me,
and it's like...

15:59.083 --> 16:00.668
-[laughing]
-I want both.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.546
How do you know you're pretty
when you get to heaven?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.131
[continued laughter]

16:07.591 --> 16:08.676
So... [laughs]

16:08.842 --> 16:11.011
I was legit not going to do it,

16:11.095 --> 16:13.263
and then my friend was like,
"Wait a second, Nikki.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.890
What about the outfits you get to wear?"

16:14.974 --> 16:16.684
And I was like, "Oh, shit."

16:16.850 --> 16:20.688
I forgot that <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>
was an excuse to dress like a slut on TV.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.107
I have... I completely forgot.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.775
It's the greatest excuse.

16:24.858 --> 16:28.404
"They made me wear this swimsuit. Oh, no."

16:28.487 --> 16:30.990
So, when I got asked to do
<i>Dancing with the Stars, </i>I was psyched,

16:31.073 --> 16:32.533
'cause I was like, "Okay, great.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.827
What other reason does
a 35-year-old comedian

16:34.910 --> 16:37.329
have to, like, wear a swimsuit on TV?"

16:37.413 --> 16:38.914
And so I got all gussied up,

16:38.998 --> 16:41.000
and it turns out I just look like
JonBenet Ramsey

16:41.083 --> 16:43.794
had she survived
and never emotionally developed.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.380
-[audience oohs, laughs]
-Like, had she just kept living,

16:46.463 --> 16:51.093
and never found any other interests
or talents, just like...

16:52.761 --> 16:55.264
Christmas Eve '95, just like...

16:55.472 --> 16:57.266
[continued laughter]

16:58.142 --> 17:00.811
I wanted to be hot on that show so bad.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.105
'Cause everyone is hot on that show.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.899
They spray-tan you
within an inch of your race.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.277
-I mean that was weird.
-[audience laughs]

17:08.736 --> 17:11.697
I came out of the spray-tan booth
one day on that show

17:11.780 --> 17:14.241
and I walked up to the producer,
I was like, "This is blackface.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.701
I'm going to get canceled."

17:16.326 --> 17:19.163
And so we, like, settled on,
like, a Guatemalan finish.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.290
-[laughing]
-And for some reason, that's an acceptable

17:21.373 --> 17:23.500
skin tone to adopt as a white woman...

17:24.168 --> 17:25.085
for now.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.255
I loved that show, dude.

17:28.338 --> 17:31.341
I was so sad when I got voted off
because it's such a hot show.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.594
My dance partner was...
He's the hottest guy

17:33.677 --> 17:35.012
I've ever seen in my life.

17:35.095 --> 17:38.849
His name is Gleb Savchenko.
He is as hot as his name is...

17:38.932 --> 17:39.767
disgusting.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.811
-[laughter]
-So those two are perfectly correlated.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.354
Gleb Savchenko.

17:44.438 --> 17:48.067
The same spittle that comes out
of my mouth when I say his name,

17:48.150 --> 17:49.902
is the same that would spritz

17:49.985 --> 17:51.320
-from between my legs
-[cheering]

17:51.403 --> 17:53.614
every time he walked
into the dance studio.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.865
It was wild.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.534
I was like,
"They're going to need to put down

17:57.618 --> 17:59.536
like a wet floor sign when I perform.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.997
I'm going to slip all over the place."
It was so hot.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.541
Everyone wanted to know,
"Did you and Gleb bang?

18:04.625 --> 18:05.959
Did you bang your partner?"

18:06.043 --> 18:08.212
And it was like, "No 'cause he was married

18:08.295 --> 18:10.631
-and he said no, so I respected that."
-[uproarious laughter]

18:12.132 --> 18:12.966
I did.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.551
[applause]

18:15.219 --> 18:16.595
Of course... He...

18:16.678 --> 18:19.098
I was just honored to be
with the hottest guy on the show

18:19.223 --> 18:21.183
because that meant
I was the hot girl on the show.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.103
That's what everyone told me,
"If you get Gleb, you're the hot girl."

18:24.186 --> 18:26.355
And I was like,
"Well, I got Gleb, so it must be!"

18:26.438 --> 18:28.524
Then I found out
that he was supposed to be partnered

18:28.607 --> 18:30.567
with a 24-year-old Instagram model,

18:30.651 --> 18:34.488
but his wife wouldn't let him,
so she hand selected me

18:34.571 --> 18:35.781
-[oohs and laughter]
-as his...

18:35.906 --> 18:37.074
[prolonged] Yep.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.492
[laughing and cheering]

18:38.742 --> 18:41.703
Old Big Bird isn't a threat, so...

18:41.829 --> 18:43.163
[uproarious laughter]

18:43.372 --> 18:45.165
And I twasn't. I twas not.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.835
Oh, my God.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.795
But that show is so sexy.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.214
Even if you don't bang your partner,
my God,

18:52.297 --> 18:55.217
I was horned up the whole time.
I'm getting touched so much.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.136
You get touched so much
when you dance,

18:57.219 --> 18:59.096
and I had just gotten out
of a relationship

18:59.179 --> 19:01.348
where I didn't get touched at all,
except when he hit me,

19:01.431 --> 19:02.766
-and so it was just like...
-[oohs]

19:03.225 --> 19:05.686
It was in bed, and if he did it more,
we would have lasted.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.147
-But that's kind of what I'm into.
-[laughter]

19:08.355 --> 19:10.566
Anyone else getting into choked
and slapped?

19:10.649 --> 19:11.567
I'm sorry.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.443
It's not, like,
every time that I want that.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.905
Just on days where I've talked to my mom
on the phone too much and I, like,

19:16.989 --> 19:20.784
don't like who I am or where I came from
and I want to be called a dumb whore.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.411
-[chuckles] It's kind of fun.
-[laughing]

19:22.494 --> 19:25.622
I like being called a stupid slut in bed,
I think it's funny,

19:25.706 --> 19:28.375
'cause I know I'm not.
Like, I was in AP English.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.586
-So, like, call me whatever you want.
-[audience laughs]

19:30.669 --> 19:31.920
-I don't care.
-[applause]

19:33.338 --> 19:34.506
I like it.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.216
But, dude...

19:36.300 --> 19:38.886
I was getting touched so much
on <i>Dancing with the Stars,</i>

19:38.969 --> 19:41.847
and I need that 'cause my love language
is touch and money,

19:41.930 --> 19:45.934
and so I was on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>
just getting it all the time.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.103
I was like hanging out
at the dance studio,

19:48.187 --> 19:50.230
like, just talking to the other dancers
all the time

19:50.314 --> 19:53.567
because then I figured out
that if you get injured they massage you.

19:53.650 --> 19:57.696
Like, the other swarthy, shirtless Russian
dancers will just like rub you

19:57.779 --> 19:59.698
and so I sprained my clit a couple times,

19:59.781 --> 20:01.617
-[laughing]
-and I was limping in with that

20:01.700 --> 20:04.203
on a daily basis, just re-injuring it.

20:07.581 --> 20:11.877
I developed an affliction called
"dancer's taint" that I made up and...

20:11.960 --> 20:13.921
[oohs and laughter]

20:15.422 --> 20:17.299
I was like, "Is there a way you could use

20:17.382 --> 20:19.259
some of that gymnastics doctor's
techniques?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.762
-[audience oohs]
-'Cause I know they were controversial,

20:21.845 --> 20:23.555
but if I consent to it..."

20:23.764 --> 20:25.265
[laughter]

20:26.934 --> 20:28.936
I gotta go. Thank you guys very much.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.520
-[cheering and applause]
-Thank you!

20:31.355 --> 20:32.272
Thank you!

20:39.446 --> 20:41.448
