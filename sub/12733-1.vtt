i see

02:53.080 --> 02:54.513
there's the contact.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.274
He's just entered.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.071
The contact has entered

03:00.160 --> 03:03.072
the contact...

04:05.960 --> 04:06.756
the dead...

04:07.040 --> 04:08.029
i see the dead

04:09.360 --> 04:10.509
the city of the dead

04:14.680 --> 04:16.033
hold the link,
don't break it

04:16.360 --> 04:17.759
hold the link
it's critical for mary.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.392
Don't break the link,
don't break it

04:22.440 --> 04:23.031
mary

04:23.640 --> 04:24.470
mary...

04:48.480 --> 04:50.755
the soul that pines
for eternity...

04:51.280 --> 04:53.111
shall outspan death.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.314
You dweller of the twilight
void come dunwich.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.678
I'm afraid mary's dead.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.035
No...

05:40.560 --> 05:41.356
alright,

05:42.640 --> 05:44.312
maybe i've got
no imagination,

05:45.960 --> 05:49.555
but your story is
a little tough to swallow.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.118
James mclewin,

05:55.800 --> 05:58.360
busted twice for peddling
and possession.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.835
That's right. So?

06:01.680 --> 06:04.797
And you expect me
to believe that

06:04.960 --> 06:07.679
mary woodhouse died
out of sheer fright

06:07.800 --> 06:09.870
while you were
having a seance?

06:13.640 --> 06:14.709
Ok fellas.

06:15.000 --> 06:15.750
You help us

06:17.000 --> 06:17.876
and we'll help you.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.555
What were you on?

06:21.160 --> 06:23.196
Coke? Grass?

06:24.000 --> 06:24.671
Where's the stash?

06:24.880 --> 06:26.393
Down the toilet?
- You don't deserve any help

06:27.040 --> 06:28.758
you're a comic book version,
sergeant.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.431
You look better in
your mugshot, you know.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.079
The great theresa.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.673
The master medium.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.996
Yeah,
for you it's all in the book

06:40.400 --> 06:41.310
your book of...

06:41.760 --> 06:43.079
what's it again?

06:43.280 --> 06:44.076
Enoch.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.508
Yeah, enoch.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.153
According to you this
poor girl is dead

06:49.360 --> 06:52.557
because of a book that
was written 4000 years ago.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.470
Correct?

06:53.880 --> 06:54.790
That's right.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.832
I'd find such
an unusual paradox

06:57.000 --> 06:59.355
of tremendous appeal
terribly stimulating

06:59.880 --> 07:01.154
if i were a sleuth.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.078
The explanation in every
detail of a crime

07:06.440 --> 07:08.192
before it's been committed.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.476
Lady,

07:09.840 --> 07:12.673
you're either on grass or
you're pulling my leg.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.196
No...
the problem is in your mind.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.118
It can't accept the truth,

07:18.760 --> 07:20.910
but i'll help you just same.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.952
In the book of
enoch the killer is...

07:23.120 --> 07:23.711
sergeant...

07:23.880 --> 07:24.790
come here and look

07:57.400 --> 07:58.799
who's playing games here?

07:58.960 --> 07:59.676
Come out of the floor,

07:59.880 --> 08:00.596
out of nowhere.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.113
Who lives downstairs?

08:05.680 --> 08:06.669
It's vacant,

08:07.200 --> 08:08.792
has been for 26 years.

08:09.000 --> 08:09.955
But how the heck did...?

08:10.160 --> 08:12.071
Don't you start
acting up too.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.836
It's only a prank and i'll
find out

08:14.920 --> 08:15.875
what's behind it even if

08:16.040 --> 08:17.553
i have to tear the whole
building apart.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.633
Keep refusing the truth.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.278
At this very precise
moment,

08:23.240 --> 08:25.037
in some other distant
town,

08:25.960 --> 08:28.349
horrendously awful
things are happening.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.473
Things that would shatter
your imagination.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.031
Hi officer.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.753
I'm looking for
sergeant clay.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.070
And who are you?

10:53.440 --> 10:53.997
I'm peter.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.718
You see, i'm with the...
- don't tell me

10:56.160 --> 10:58.469
you're a newspaper
reporter, right?

10:58.680 --> 11:00.716
I can smell you guys
a mile away.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.718
You're right,
i'm a journalist.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.512
Look, there's a rumor down a
the station house

11:04.680 --> 11:07.069
that someone kind
of died mysteriously

11:07.240 --> 11:08.639
and i wanna talk to
the sergeant about it.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.234
It's not going to be any
mystery

11:10.360 --> 11:11.076
how the next guy dies

11:11.200 --> 11:13.156
if i let any unauthorized
people in that house.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.754
Look...

11:18.640 --> 11:21.359
isn't there a way that
maybe you and i

11:21.560 --> 11:23.551
could come to a sort of
gentleman's agreement?

11:23.960 --> 11:25.791
You're talking into deaf
ear, pal.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.598
Now take my advice and
beat it before

11:27.720 --> 11:29.199
the sergeant comes out.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.758
Ok, i'll take your advice.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.512
It's like we're in the wrong
season suddenly.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.516
Damn dusty

12:00.760 --> 12:01.795
all these high winds,

12:02.240 --> 12:03.195
pretty unusual.

12:05.000 --> 12:05.591
By the way,

12:05.680 --> 12:07.989
i hear cindy heran
never went home last night.

12:08.120 --> 12:08.791
So?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.672
It sure wouldn't be
the first time.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.438
I remember once she was
sitting in...

12:49.200 --> 12:50.474
you know something?

12:51.960 --> 12:54.110
Ever since father thomas
hanged himself

12:55.560 --> 12:57.073
dunwich ain't been the
same.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.155
Kind of scary

13:01.320 --> 13:02.196
a few beers and you fellas

13:02.360 --> 13:04.715
start seeing ghouls and
devils all over the place.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.753
Well, you saw what
happened, didn't you?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.154
Sure, but that doesn't
mean that

13:08.360 --> 13:09.190
there isn't any explanation.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.793
It could have been a truck
passing by

13:10.960 --> 13:11.676
the vibration

13:13.040 --> 13:14.553
anyway,
i've lost my mirror.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.838
You forget who our
ancestors were?

13:17.360 --> 13:17.917
No.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.031
I've forgot how many
beers you have drunk.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.433
So let's have another.
House buys.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.396
I've gotta go

13:37.640 --> 13:38.550
but wait, what about...
- see you

13:38.720 --> 13:39.869
me too
wait up, mike.

13:40.160 --> 13:40.797
I'll see you around

13:41.040 --> 13:42.598
wait, guys... guys...

13:49.200 --> 13:51.270
brand new building...
new construction.

13:53.040 --> 13:53.836
I tell you,

13:57.440 --> 13:58.873
more garbage like this...

13:59.360 --> 14:01.271
i'm gonna loose
all of my customers.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.552
The language is scary,
i admit it.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.829
But the overall message

14:09.000 --> 14:10.956
couldn't have been more
puritanical.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.589
Then why did you choose
the topic of incest?

14:16.320 --> 14:17.389
When i was 8 years old

14:17.600 --> 14:19.431
i wanted to marry
my father.

14:20.040 --> 14:23.112
I guess all girls that age
want to marry their fathers.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.270
Anyway,

14:25.480 --> 14:26.959
i got over it pretty quickly

14:27.160 --> 14:28.229
he was a drunk.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.993
One day he just picked up

14:31.200 --> 14:32.918
and left
my mother and me.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.715
Did this leave any

14:35.000 --> 14:37.468
particular emotional
feeling in you at the time?

14:38.240 --> 14:39.195
Emptiness.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.513
That and pity for my
mother.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.395
I began to hate all men
and i...

14:45.920 --> 14:46.750
excuse me jerry.

14:47.680 --> 14:48.715
Hi, sandra.

14:49.000 --> 14:49.750
How are you?

14:49.880 --> 14:50.915
Hello emily.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.276
How come so early?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.398
I mean i thought
we made it for eight.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.636
That's the trouble.
I can't make it tonight.

14:59.000 --> 14:59.876
I have to see bob.

15:00.080 --> 15:00.910
Bob?

15:02.480 --> 15:03.754
You're not upset are you?

15:03.960 --> 15:05.313
No, i'm not upset.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.518
Maybe a little worried
perhaps.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.956
You've been seeing
an awful lot of him,

15:10.120 --> 15:11.235
haven't you, lately?

15:13.440 --> 15:14.270
Poor bob.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.396
He's a sick and ionely kid.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.594
I don't see why people
hate him so.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.231
His mother was what you call
a woman of easy virtue.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.953
No husband. No morals.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.276
Here in dunwich,

15:29.480 --> 15:32.278
anybody like that
is also branded a witch.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.509
Look sandra.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.476
I don't believe those
idiots who tell me

15:38.640 --> 15:41.950
that our ancestors were
salem witch burners alright?

15:42.080 --> 15:43.195
Okay, okay

15:45.280 --> 15:46.998
jerry, i'm sorry.
- Don't worry

15:47.400 --> 15:49.118
i'll see you tomorrow.
Around 9?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.190
Sure thing.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.196
Bye.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.236
So long sandra.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.873
Bye bye and take it easy.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.152
Jerry, bye.
- Bye

16:02.840 --> 16:03.829
okay sandra,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.115
where were we?

16:06.280 --> 16:08.157
On the same old problem,
men.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.918
Why do they have to
make life so difficult?

16:16.040 --> 16:16.711
Sandra

16:17.160 --> 16:17.956
sandra...

16:19.760 --> 16:20.590
did he hurt you?

16:21.640 --> 16:22.356
Did he claw you?

16:22.560 --> 16:23.390
He must have been
frightened.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.357
Strange.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.477
It's the first time he
ever acted up like that.

16:32.160 --> 16:32.910
He loves to have you
pet him.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.308
He always comes to
you when you're here.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.599
Something must have
frightened him.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.078
...give me the
dirtiest thoughts...

16:46.320 --> 16:47.116
i'm telling you,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.192
you're gonna end up
a dirty old man.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.435
A pervert.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.710
Peeping tom.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.436
Talk about
box lunches man

16:58.440 --> 16:59.998
saw a porno flick once,

17:00.400 --> 17:02.152
where this guy got so
carried away

17:02.320 --> 17:03.799
he humped himself to death.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.548
Too much of good thing

17:05.760 --> 17:07.079
but what a way to go

17:15.079 --> 17:15.637
what's the matter?

17:15.720 --> 17:17.039
Never seen a body
in the earth before?

17:17.680 --> 17:19.032
Any law against looking?

17:19.240 --> 17:20.150
Yeah

17:20.800 --> 17:22.199
okay, i'm leaving.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.510
What time you got?

17:27.599 --> 17:28.749
Let's flip to see who
goes in the hole

17:28.920 --> 17:29.670
alright.

17:31.080 --> 17:31.796
Call it.

17:32.240 --> 17:32.990
Heads.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.268
Tails.
In the hole, sucker.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.509
Shit...

18:41.000 --> 18:42.228
what are you still
doing here, pal?

18:43.080 --> 18:44.149
Come on fellas.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.918
What do you want from us?
- Nothing

18:46.120 --> 18:48.236
i'm just curious about
this girl here, that's all.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.237
Look, why don't you guys
go ahead with your work

18:50.360 --> 18:51.679
and just pretend i'm not
around.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.837
Well move, cause we're
almost finished.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.349
It's 5 o'clock.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.557
We've busted our
balls enough, let's go.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.712
You're not going to leave
her like that, are you?

20:11.880 --> 20:12.630
Union hours.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.236
Anyway, what does she care?

20:14.440 --> 20:15.714
She's not in any hurry.

20:17.240 --> 20:17.877
Is she?

22:51.520 --> 22:52.714
Oh, my god...

23:47.360 --> 23:48.270
but for you,

23:48.480 --> 23:50.835
mary would have suffered
a terrible death.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.274
I was just lucky.

23:54.760 --> 23:55.476
No

23:56.040 --> 23:57.189
it was written.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.111
Are you acquainted with
the book of enoch?

24:01.040 --> 24:04.749
A text which dates back to
more than 4000 years ago.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.508
It contains man's first
recorded description of

24:08.160 --> 24:09.752
his boundless
mortal fear

24:09.880 --> 24:12.030
in the face of malice itself

24:12.640 --> 24:15.279
the demanding implacable
enemy who's search for blood

24:15.440 --> 24:16.919
is never satiated.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.951
Mary, tell your experience.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.594
Everything you've witnessed
during our last seance.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.353
The city of the dead...

24:26.080 --> 24:27.798
the living dead.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.957
A cursed city

24:31.800 --> 24:34.268
where the gates of hell
have been opened.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.557
Where exactly is this city?

24:41.400 --> 24:42.833
I don't know where it is.

24:43.800 --> 24:48.271
All i know is that it is
called dunwich.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.154
I've never heard of it.

24:51.800 --> 24:52.789
How do you know?

24:53.040 --> 24:54.758
I mean how can you
be so sure?

24:55.320 --> 24:56.389
I read the name

24:57.920 --> 24:59.319
on a tombstone

24:59.640 --> 25:00.436
mr. Bell,

25:00.800 --> 25:02.472
if those gates are left
open it may be

25:02.640 --> 25:03.959
the end of humanity.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.757
We gotta try to get them
shut again.

25:07.480 --> 25:08.515
At midnight on monday

25:08.640 --> 25:10.278
we go into all saints day.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.511
The night of the dead
begins then.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.308
And if the portals of hell
don't get shut before then,

25:15.640 --> 25:18.393
no dead body will ever be
able to rest in peace again.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.875
And so the dead will rise
up and take over the earth.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.798
You've got to get to
dunwich.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.990
You must re-close those
gates

25:59.320 --> 26:00.469
bob?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.234
Bob, are you here?

26:07.760 --> 26:08.636
Bob?

26:11.600 --> 26:12.316
Bob?

26:22.120 --> 26:22.996
Bob...?

26:27.480 --> 26:28.196
Bob

26:29.880 --> 26:30.756
bob...

26:31.120 --> 26:32.030
what happened?

26:32.320 --> 26:33.389
Did you hurt yourself?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.116
Bob

26:46.240 --> 26:47.229
bob...

26:47.960 --> 26:48.676
bob

26:49.200 --> 26:50.189
bob...

26:51.600 --> 26:52.430
don't leave me alone

26:52.520 --> 26:53.350
i'm afraid...

27:31.240 --> 27:32.036
hello?

27:33.880 --> 27:34.995
It's you, mr. Robbins.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.798
No, emily's not here,
i'm afraid.

27:38.760 --> 27:39.510
What's that?

27:39.720 --> 27:41.438
She's usually home
this hour of the night.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.598
I hope that nothing's
happened to her.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.870
There's been a lot of
strange talk circulating.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.354
Come on now
mr. Robbins.

27:47.520 --> 27:48.316
Ignore it.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.272
People here in this town
thrive on that stuff.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.549
You should know it
by now.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.755
She'll be home in another
couple of minutes.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.599
If you need me for any
reason though,

27:56.720 --> 27:57.357
feel free to call.

27:57.560 --> 27:58.515
I should be at the studio
for at least

27:58.720 --> 28:00.358
another hour or so, okay?

28:01.440 --> 28:02.793
Goodbye mr. Robbins.

28:03.160 --> 28:03.956
Goodbye

28:34.040 --> 28:35.837
no, no...
come on tommy, please.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.912
No please, tommy

28:38.480 --> 28:40.152
what the devil's the matter
honey?

28:40.360 --> 28:41.588
You treat me like i was a
stranger.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.073
What have i done?
Tell me.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.557
How come you picked out
here to park?

28:45.760 --> 28:47.159
This place gives me
the willies.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.237
Oh, rose. Come on.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.595
You're not a little child
now.

28:49.760 --> 28:50.875
You don't really believe in
that stupid

28:51.080 --> 28:52.638
salem witch stuff, do you?

28:53.200 --> 28:54.315
Of course not.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.989
Now what's wrong?

29:23.200 --> 29:24.428
Sorry tommy, but...

29:24.640 --> 29:26.710
but i keep thinking that
someone's out there

29:26.880 --> 29:28.074
spying on us.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.752
Come on.
There isn't anyone out there

29:32.200 --> 29:33.553
watch.
I'll turn on the headlights.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.715
You know this dunwich

31:39.600 --> 31:40.794
it's not even on the map.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.550
So, you don't believe me,
do you?

31:44.680 --> 31:45.954
That's not the point.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.111
It's just going to be harder
to find, that's all.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.311
We don't even know
where to start, do we?

31:50.880 --> 31:52.950
You know i get my inner
visions too. You know.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.877
Just let me meditate
over a bottle of scotch

31:57.400 --> 31:58.276
...and?

32:00.440 --> 32:01.919
And i'll take you anywhere.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.071
Well, she certainly wasn't
strangled.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.634
Doesn't seem to have been
any kind of physical abuse.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.638
What was the cause of her
death then?

32:40.840 --> 32:42.114
Some kind of cardiac arrest.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.840
Only that expression on her
face looks like pure fear

32:44.960 --> 32:46.313
like something scared
her to death.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.072
Scared her?
- Excuse me, mr. Robbins

32:48.240 --> 32:49.992
do you know if your daughter
had a heart condition?

32:50.160 --> 32:51.115
No...

32:53.880 --> 32:54.517
oh god...

32:56.120 --> 32:57.235
well, what's our procedure?

32:57.360 --> 32:57.917
Sit tight.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.519
Everything depends
on the autopsy.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.590
I'll sit tight

33:00.840 --> 33:02.558
you'll get your order after
that from the d.a.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.517
Okay, but let me hear
from you, joe

33:07.120 --> 33:08.553
what's your opinion,
jerry?

33:09.880 --> 33:10.995
What's there to say.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.634
I'm at a total loss.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.432
It was bob...

33:14.720 --> 33:16.153
that pervert?
- You can bet on it

33:16.360 --> 33:17.475
they should have
put him away for life

33:17.680 --> 33:19.875
after what he tried to do
with poor little anne ross

33:20.840 --> 33:23.195
listen, i'll call all three
cars out after that boy

33:23.880 --> 33:25.393
and i wouldn't be surprised
if he could tell us

33:25.560 --> 33:29.030
what happened to rosy
kellman and frank's kid, too

33:29.280 --> 33:30.110
sheriff russell...

33:31.000 --> 33:31.591
sheriff

33:31.880 --> 33:33.313
what the dickens is this?

33:43.320 --> 33:44.469
Good lord...

33:45.320 --> 33:46.753
that kid is gonna fry...

33:47.200 --> 33:48.394
mark my word.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.518
So, your newspaper editor
wouldn't believe you?

34:02.240 --> 34:04.231
Listen.
When adrian deniro told me

34:04.400 --> 34:05.753
about 2 years ago

34:06.040 --> 34:07.792
that i'd meet a girl who
would be buried alive,

34:08.239 --> 34:09.228
i didn't believe him either.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.078
I mean, i laughed right
in his face.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.556
Deniro was aware of
many things.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.795
He knew all about the
city of the dead.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.237
Okay, okay.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.154
Say i believe you.

34:24.080 --> 34:24.751
Did you see...

34:24.960 --> 34:27.076
when you were in this
trance did you see anything

34:27.400 --> 34:29.072
besides that tombstone?

34:29.199 --> 34:30.030
Oh yes.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.474
I saw a priest

34:36.280 --> 34:37.871
who by hanging himself

34:38.840 --> 34:40.353
opened the gates of hell.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.591
He must be destroyed...

34:57.520 --> 34:58.350
...amen.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.588
The lord is my shepherd...

35:02.440 --> 35:03.429
this way please.

35:09.000 --> 35:09.796
Where is she?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.194
Where is my emily?

35:11.440 --> 35:13.032
She's in heaven now,
mrs. Robbins

36:15.440 --> 36:16.236
mrs. Holden?

36:16.440 --> 36:18.510
Yes. Mrs. Holden died
last night

36:18.680 --> 36:19.749
and according to
dr. Thompson,

36:20.000 --> 36:21.115
was frightened to death.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.879
Frightened to death?

36:23.200 --> 36:24.519
That's what she
said, fear.

36:24.720 --> 36:25.596
Of what?

36:26.560 --> 36:27.436
Damned if i know, doc.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.159
It's the strangest thing
i've ever heard of.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.315
Fear?

36:33.400 --> 36:34.150
There's been talk that

36:34.320 --> 36:36.390
rose calvin and tommy
fisher disappeared too.

36:36.680 --> 36:37.669
They went to the movies
last night

36:37.880 --> 36:39.074
and nobody has
seen them since.

36:39.480 --> 36:40.674
That makes five people
that have

36:40.880 --> 36:42.279
disappeared in the last
48 hours.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.115
I think it's bob.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.635
I don't believe in this
superstitious nonsense.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.191
Yeah, maybe you're right

36:49.800 --> 36:51.916
sure, remember two years
ago when

36:52.080 --> 36:53.672
bob took little anne into
the woods?

36:55.200 --> 36:56.918
It was a miracle we found
him in time.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.793
Yeah, and i say it's him

36:59.360 --> 37:01.476
he's the one causing all
the trouble around here.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.632
God only knows what he
did to poor emily.

37:04.480 --> 37:05.993
All i know is that the air
in dunwich

37:06.200 --> 37:07.189
is getting awful thick...

37:07.720 --> 37:08.550
soon as i can find

37:08.720 --> 37:10.551
somebody to buy my
shop and my house

37:10.840 --> 37:11.795
i'm vamoosing.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.468
You can bet your ass.

37:14.680 --> 37:15.430
Calm down, dear.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.396
Take it easy.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.310
Calm down.

37:18.040 --> 37:21.271
My baby, my poor baby

37:24.000 --> 37:26.309
you better take
john john out.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.476
Yes, of course.

37:28.160 --> 37:28.910
John john

37:29.240 --> 37:30.434
come on.
Let's go outside.

37:30.640 --> 37:31.550
Let's take a walk.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.195
You have to be
strong now.

37:33.480 --> 37:34.959
You have to find courage
to face reality.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.515
You have to be a man.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.590
Do you know what i mean?

38:42.640 --> 38:43.390
I'm hungry

38:43.880 --> 38:44.710
good.

38:44.960 --> 38:47.394
There's a lollipop in the
glove box

38:50.240 --> 38:50.956
look. I'm not joking.

38:51.120 --> 38:51.996
I'm starved.

38:52.160 --> 38:52.831
Look, you're the one

38:53.000 --> 38:54.877
who got me out here
in the armpit of the world

38:55.120 --> 38:57.793
chasing your galloping
cadavers.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.310
Come on.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.313
Let's go have a snack
someplace

39:03.000 --> 39:03.830
okay.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.389
You want to give up?

39:09.560 --> 39:10.549
Why don't you get in
the car

39:10.680 --> 39:12.830
we'll go and check out
the local cuisine.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.229
Don't be upset.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.590
Upset? Who's upset?

39:22.280 --> 39:23.793
According to your
theory we have less than

39:23.960 --> 39:27.430
48 hours before
this... aii saints day.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.639
Oh please. Not now.
Do you mind?

39:29.920 --> 39:30.716
Come on.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.235
Let's go check out
the local cuisine

43:19.160 --> 43:20.195
mommy...

43:23.000 --> 43:24.718
daddy... mommy... daddy...

43:25.560 --> 43:26.788
mommy...

43:27.000 --> 43:28.228
what's the matter, honey?

43:28.600 --> 43:29.316
Emily is back.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.953
I saw her
looking in the window.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.354
She wanted to catch me.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.669
Emily went away forever,
john john

43:35.960 --> 43:37.029
she's in heaven.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.196
I saw her...
i swear, i saw her

43:39.400 --> 43:40.549
i really did

43:41.880 --> 43:43.199
you better call the doctor.

43:43.960 --> 43:44.597
I'm alright...

43:44.840 --> 43:45.989
i don't need a doctor.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.951
I don't want a doctor...
i saw her

43:49.440 --> 43:50.350
you had a big day.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.676
You're upset.

43:52.440 --> 43:53.316
We all are.

43:53.760 --> 43:55.239
Off you go now.
Go to bed.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.757
I don't wanna go, mommy
i'm scared...

43:58.160 --> 44:00.515
emily's gonna get me
i know it...

45:19.040 --> 45:19.950
hello?

45:20.080 --> 45:21.798
It's me, sandra.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.109
You have to come
right away.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.279
No, there's no time
to explain.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.152
You wouldn't believe
me anyway.

45:27.280 --> 45:28.235
Just come, please

45:28.560 --> 45:30.152
i'm having a
nervous breakdown...

45:30.480 --> 45:31.708
yes, okay. Sandra,

45:31.960 --> 45:33.518
just calm down
and control yourself.

45:33.720 --> 45:34.470
What is it?

45:34.600 --> 45:35.999
There's only two
possibilities.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.599
Either i'm going out
of my mind or

45:37.760 --> 45:39.830
something very very strange
is happening.

45:40.320 --> 45:40.877
Look, take it easy.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.718
I'll be there
in 10 minutes, honey.

45:43.280 --> 45:43.917
Bye.

46:51.080 --> 46:52.035
Jerry, is that you?

46:52.240 --> 46:53.275
Yeah, it's me.

46:58.560 --> 46:59.310
Come in...

47:00.080 --> 47:00.796
come in

47:13.800 --> 47:15.233
what do you need
that for?

47:16.600 --> 47:17.430
I don't know,

47:17.640 --> 47:19.312
maybe a crucifix
would be better.

47:19.480 --> 47:20.549
A crucifix?

47:20.800 --> 47:22.518
What the hell are
you talking about?

47:26.280 --> 47:27.315
Tell me the truth.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.078
Do you consider
me a basket case?

47:30.280 --> 47:31.838
No, not at all.
Why?

47:32.440 --> 47:34.510
Your nurturing a pet
neurosis, that's all.

47:34.720 --> 47:35.550
Like about 70% of the

47:35.680 --> 47:37.591
female population
in this country.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.233
So according to you i'm
not stark raving mad,

47:41.720 --> 47:42.709
at a least not yet.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.239
Don't be silly.
Of course not.

47:44.920 --> 47:45.432
Sometimes you may

47:45.640 --> 47:46.470
drink a little more
than you should,

47:46.640 --> 47:47.755
but that's no reason to be
taken away

47:47.960 --> 47:49.075
and put into a looney
house.

47:49.560 --> 47:51.039
No, i'd rather not right
now

47:51.160 --> 47:52.195
and you really shouldn't
either.

47:54.240 --> 47:54.911
Alright.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.759
You better see for
yourself.

47:57.280 --> 47:58.190
It's in the kitchen.

47:59.160 --> 48:00.070
The kitchen?

48:12.840 --> 48:13.829
Oh, christ

48:36.160 --> 48:38.037
was i just imagining
things?

48:39.520 --> 48:40.430
It can't be...

48:41.280 --> 48:42.838
it's her. Mrs. Holden.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.435
This morning she was inside
a coffin at the funeral home

48:45.720 --> 48:47.597
and now she's here in my
kitchen.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.558
How?
How did she get here?

48:49.680 --> 48:50.396
I don't know.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.276
I heard a noise.

48:51.480 --> 48:53.471
I came to look and
there she was on my floor.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.359
I called you right after.

48:55.720 --> 48:57.517
I thought i was loosing
my mind.

48:57.720 --> 48:58.596
Okay.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.439
Let's use our heads
and not panic.

49:00.600 --> 49:01.350
Calm down.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.989
We've gotta find out how
she got here, alright?

49:04.600 --> 49:06.113
I couldn't give a damn
how she got here.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.474
I just want her gone.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.749
Let's get her out of here.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.434
I can't take the sight
of her.

49:11.640 --> 49:13.039
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.595
At this point, a good stiff
drink is the only medicine

49:24.080 --> 49:25.115
what are you gonna do?

49:27.240 --> 49:29.117
I don't believe in the
twilight zone

49:29.360 --> 49:31.112
so i guess i'll call the
the sheriff on this matter.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.435
And what do you tell him?

49:32.760 --> 49:33.909
I'll tell him exactly what
you told me.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.116
That you heard this noise.

49:35.360 --> 49:35.917
That you came running

49:36.080 --> 49:36.830
and that you saw her there,

49:37.000 --> 49:38.035
and the rest is up to them.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.155
What was that?

50:07.760 --> 50:08.909
The door is closed
but we left it wide open.

50:29.480 --> 50:30.799
Someone took her away.

50:31.480 --> 50:32.754
Or maybe she just left.

50:33.040 --> 50:33.711
Don't be ridiculous

50:33.960 --> 50:34.995
bodies don't just
get up and walk away

50:35.120 --> 50:35.950
by themselves.

50:39.760 --> 50:40.909
She's still here

50:41.080 --> 50:42.308
she's still in the house...

50:44.760 --> 50:45.476
sandra...

50:46.400 --> 50:47.435
sandra...
get a hold of yourself

50:47.720 --> 50:48.789
i don't want to stay
here anymore

50:49.400 --> 50:50.515
jerry get her out

50:50.680 --> 50:51.669
calm down...
- please...

50:51.840 --> 50:52.875
tell her to go...

50:53.560 --> 50:55.039
she's in here
you hear her.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.430
Jerry, she's in here,
i can't take it anymore.

50:57.680 --> 50:58.430
Sandra

50:58.600 --> 50:59.669
sandra, calm down.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.072
Don't let imagination
run away with you.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.998
I don't know what the hell
is going on here either,

51:06.640 --> 51:08.915
so were going to take it
step by step

51:09.080 --> 51:11.196
and search every room in
the house, alright?

51:11.520 --> 51:13.476
And we'll find the reason,
alright sandra?

51:13.600 --> 51:14.669
And you're going to
follow me.

51:14.920 --> 51:15.909
Follow me now

51:16.320 --> 51:17.912
come on, that's it.

51:19.280 --> 51:19.951
Alright?

51:20.320 --> 51:21.116
Alright.

51:21.360 --> 51:22.873
I'll do whatever you say.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.835
I don't think i'll manage to
sleep here tonight.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.718
If you want to stay at my
studio or my house

52:08.880 --> 52:09.790
you're always welcome.

52:35.040 --> 52:36.917
Good god...
it's blood...

52:37.320 --> 52:38.275
blood...

52:52.160 --> 52:53.149
dunwich?

52:54.280 --> 52:55.508
Yes. Yes. I know it.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.355
Odd that you're looking
for dunwich.

52:58.600 --> 52:59.510
Yes, as a matter of fact...

52:59.680 --> 53:01.989
yes, that's the town
where father thomas...

53:02.240 --> 53:05.073
terrible... terrible

53:05.840 --> 53:07.034
you know that dunwich

53:07.240 --> 53:09.834
was built on the ruins
of the original salem.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.434
That village of witches
and heresy.

53:12.600 --> 53:13.635
And evil...

53:14.000 --> 53:15.752
yes, but can you tell us
how to get there?

53:16.440 --> 53:17.395
It's not easy.

53:17.720 --> 53:19.950
You'll have to go back
towards the highway

53:21.160 --> 53:24.516
and as you approach it
there's a road going left

53:25.240 --> 53:26.559
blocked by a landslide.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.394
That will take you to
dunwich.

53:28.560 --> 53:29.629
Thanks a lot.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.232
Just out of curiousity...

53:34.040 --> 53:35.996
why are you folks going
down there?

53:37.200 --> 53:38.599
We're just looking up a
friend.

53:39.920 --> 53:40.909
I see.

53:44.360 --> 53:45.156
Thanks again.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.069
Good lord, help us.

54:30.720 --> 54:31.516
Bob...

54:34.160 --> 54:35.195
hi ann.

54:40.000 --> 54:40.671
What are you doing in

54:40.840 --> 54:41.955
the back seat
of my dad's car?

54:42.320 --> 54:43.594
I didn't know where
to sleep.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.189
You won't tell anyone
will you?

54:45.400 --> 54:46.196
No, of course not.

54:46.360 --> 54:47.713
Although you get some
awfully weird ideas.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.233
Come on, smoke

54:49.440 --> 54:50.839
only then you better split,
okay?

54:50.960 --> 54:51.676
Ann...

54:51.920 --> 54:52.432
it's him

54:52.600 --> 54:53.350
go on...
get out of here

54:53.520 --> 54:54.509
what are you doing?

54:55.480 --> 54:56.196
Get in the house...

54:58.720 --> 55:00.312
i can explain everything,
mr. Ross

55:00.440 --> 55:01.236
shut up you bastard...

55:06.240 --> 55:07.878
what were you trying to
do with my daughter?

55:11.000 --> 55:12.353
Please, let me explain,
mr. Ross.

55:12.520 --> 55:13.999
I was only looking for a
place to sleep.

55:15.040 --> 55:15.870
I swear

55:19.280 --> 55:19.996
pervert...

55:20.200 --> 55:20.996
murderer...

57:05.920 --> 57:07.069
i guess there's nobody in.

57:07.520 --> 57:08.430
That's strange.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.114
What do you plan on
doing?

57:11.360 --> 57:13.157
I have a feeling this is
where the answer is.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.549
We've gotta find the
undertaker

57:14.720 --> 57:15.948
or someone from the
funeral parlor.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.309
Maybe they have gone
to the cemetery.

57:18.160 --> 57:18.637
You go.

57:18.760 --> 57:19.795
I'll wait in your office.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.514
I don't think i can take a
cemetery right now.

57:22.680 --> 57:23.476
Fair enough.

57:53.840 --> 57:56.149
"Dweller of the twilight
void..."

57:57.560 --> 57:58.276
well?

57:58.400 --> 57:59.435
Yes...

57:59.720 --> 58:00.755
that's it

58:01.640 --> 58:03.551
that's the very same
tombstone

58:04.240 --> 58:05.468
that i saw in my trance.

58:06.720 --> 58:07.391
Great.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.313
Welcome to
the city of the dead.

58:10.600 --> 58:11.715
Now what do we do?

58:11.920 --> 58:14.673
We must find the priest's
grave and uncover him.

58:15.320 --> 58:16.469
There isn't much time left.

58:17.080 --> 58:18.798
All saints day begins at
midnight.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.149
Where do we start?

58:22.920 --> 58:25.275
Okay...
it's gonna be one of these.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.955
Good thing he didn't hang
himself in arlington.

59:08.720 --> 59:09.516
Yes?

59:10.040 --> 59:10.756
Excuse me.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.672
I wonder if you could
give us some information.

59:12.880 --> 59:13.630
Sure.

59:14.240 --> 59:15.593
Well, we're looking for

59:16.160 --> 59:17.195
a tombstone of...

59:18.600 --> 59:20.033
of a priest who
hanged himself.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.075
Father thomas?

59:26.600 --> 59:28.192
We don't know his name.

59:29.440 --> 59:31.396
Well, why are you looking
for his burial site?

59:33.720 --> 59:35.312
It's a long story.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.472
One you might not want to
believe.

59:37.760 --> 59:38.476
Try me.

59:38.680 --> 59:39.317
I'm just about ready to

59:39.520 --> 59:41.158
believe anything
at this point.

59:42.040 --> 59:43.393
That's the whole story.

59:44.840 --> 59:46.114
My god in heaven...

59:47.160 --> 59:48.149
the living dead.

59:48.360 --> 59:50.237
And that's why you're here
in dunwich?

59:50.640 --> 59:51.436
What do you wanna do?

59:51.560 --> 59:53.039
What are you
hoping to accomplish?

59:53.480 --> 59:57.393
The death of father thomas
gave birth to some...

59:58.200 --> 59:59.633
some evil.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.276
They're worms...

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.675
who's speaking?

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.109
Alright, john john
now listen to me

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.669
you take it easy.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.353
Stay right there and
don't move.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.589
I'll be right over.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.795
What happened?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.911
That was emily's little
brother, john

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.834
he just told me that emily
killed her parents...

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.035
emily died 2 days ago.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.634
Jerry, jerry

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.751
i'm scared, jerry,
i'm scared...

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.517
it's all over.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.835
Everything's going to
be all right.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.719
You girls take care of him,
please?

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.516
Sure.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.551
Come on

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:00.752
my car?

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.710
Yeah, okay

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.556
in you go.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.151
Oh god.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.715
Oh god all mighty

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.589
totally butchered.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.838
Literally ripped to shreds.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.913
You're sure it was emily?

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.314
Yeah, but she was all
different.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.635
She looked like,

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.076
she was like...

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.469
like she was dead.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.791
And she was eating
mommy and daddy

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.832
poor kid.
You poor darling.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.312
Jerry...

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.595
jerry, listen.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.028
We've got to go to the
funeral parlour

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.435
and then we've got
to look for that...

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.512
that grave of the priest
- alright.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:36.757
Well?

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.396
Is the kid alright?

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.470
Scared to death.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.436
John john...

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:46.791
it's all right.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.189
It's going to be all right.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.109
It's all over now

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.475
now listen, sandra

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.035
go to the studio with
john john

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.958
stay there and don't let him
out of your sight

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:26.717
yeah, sure

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.518
jerry, we'd better
get a move on

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.716
we only have

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.514
god knows what else
will happen

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.269
emily?

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:44.950
No...

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:45.990
no

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.071
go away

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.551
no...

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.076
go away...

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.270
