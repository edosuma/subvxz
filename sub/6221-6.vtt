00:01.627 --> 00:05.047
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.131 --> 00:10.219
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.303 --> 00:13.181
His name, Merlin.

00:46.422 --> 00:49.717
(CHANTING)

01:00.019 --> 01:01.812
Look what's just arrived for you.

01:02.313 --> 01:03.731
Who are they from?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.525
| don't know. Maybe Arthur?

01:06.984 --> 01:08.486
How disappointing.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.529
Why, who'd you like them to be from?

01:10.655 --> 01:12.823
| don't know. A tall dark stranger?

01:32.510 --> 01:34.679
See you in the morning.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.261
GAIUS: Her body seems
to have closed down.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.138
UTHER: Why?

02:59.597 --> 03:01.223
You don't have an answer, do you?

03:02.391 --> 03:04.935
Nothing you've tried so far has worked.

03:05.311 --> 03:07.021
It's been nearly two days.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.649
What do you know?

03:10.775 --> 03:14.236
| fear she may have some form
of inflammation of the brain.

03:14.445 --> 03:15.863
What could have caused such a thing?

03:15.946 --> 03:17.573
An infection, possibly.

03:18.741 --> 03:21.994
Rest assured, I will do everything
in my power to cure her, sire.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.248
Is she any better?

03:35.341 --> 03:36.967
She's all but dead, Merlin.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.137
No, you're going to cure her.
You have to.

03:40.638 --> 03:43.557
Don't you start. I've tried everything.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.601
- Was wondering...
-What?

03:45.851 --> 03:46.936
Maybe I could...

03:48.312 --> 03:50.439
Ahem, help?

03:51.065 --> 03:53.109
If you're suggesting magic...

03:53.818 --> 03:55.986
Have you forgotten what happened
with Gwen's father?

03:56.987 --> 04:01.283
This is not a magical illness.
It must be cured by conventional means.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.452
We keep trying.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.580
See if you can find me
some fresh rosemary.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.040
There must be something more I can do...

04:08.124 --> 04:09.417
And yarrow.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.466
What's your business here?

04:17.800 --> 04:20.010
My name is Edwin Muirden.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.347
And I have a remedy to cure all ills.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.932
Is that so?

04:25.015 --> 04:28.686
-I beg an audience with the king.
-Our court has a physician.

04:30.354 --> 04:33.774
| hear the Lady Morgana is gravely ill.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.528
That is no concern of yours.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.532
| may be able to help her.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.367
Our physician has the matter in hand.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.457
I'll be at the inn.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.377
In case you change your mind.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.552
It's going to be all right.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.429
It is. I know it is.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.056
She's going to be absolutely...

05:06.140 --> 05:07.641
-Merlin!
-What?

05:08.309 --> 05:10.853
You're making me anxious.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.647
But I'm not worried.

05:13.731 --> 05:16.567
Then stop pacing!

05:38.422 --> 05:40.841
| cannot preserve her life
for much longer.

05:40.925 --> 05:42.927
She has hours, maybe less.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.930
-We cannot let her die!
-Arthur, please.

05:48.933 --> 05:49.934
There's a man.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.229
He came to the castle yesterday.
He claims he can cure her.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.357
That's ridiculous.
He doesn't know what's wrong with her.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.567
He says he has a remedy
to cure all ills.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.444
-Impossible.
-But for Morgana's sake,

06:00.528 --> 06:03.447
surely, we should at least hear him out.
| mean...

06:03.739 --> 06:05.199
What have we got to lose?

06:05.991 --> 06:07.451
Please, Father.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.037
Probably some charlatan
hoping for a quick shilling.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.163
| don't care.

06:11.247 --> 06:12.873
If she's about to die,
what harm can it do?

06:12.957 --> 06:15.626
Give him his shilling.
If there's one chance in a million

06:15.709 --> 06:18.295
he can save her, then why not?

06:22.007 --> 06:23.300
Send for him.

06:32.810 --> 06:36.730
Edwin Muirden, sire.
Physician and loyal servant.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.983
Welcome to Camelot.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.403
Have we met before?

06:42.486 --> 06:43.821
(SCOFFS)

06:44.321 --> 06:46.657
| doubt you would forget
a face like mine, sir.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.410
Do you really believe you have a remedy?

06:50.494 --> 06:52.079
There are not many ills

06:52.162 --> 06:55.291
that I have not seen
and successfully treated, sire.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.419
So when I heard of
the Lady Morgana's sickness

06:58.502 --> 07:01.005
| felt honor-bound to offer my services.

07:01.088 --> 07:05.092
You say you have a cure for all,
an antidote for everything.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.263
Yes, although it is not
quite as simple as that.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.016
Gaius is the court physician.

07:12.308 --> 07:16.186
You are indeed a legend, sir.
| am delighted to meet you.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.277
I'm curious to know what it is
that has affected her.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.697
-An infection of the brain.
-And your treatment?

07:26.989 --> 07:29.283
-Yarrow.
-Yes, yes.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.202
Rosemary to stimulate
cerebral circulation.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.788
-Interesting.
-ARTHUR: Why?

07:34.872 --> 07:36.457
-What would you suggest?
-No, no. No, no, no.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.043
That is all fine, all good.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.463
If that is the right diagnosis.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.799
What would your diagnosis be?

07:47.551 --> 07:51.889
Well, without examining the patient...

07:53.140 --> 07:55.559
He should examine her.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.897
-I would need my equipment.
-UTHER: Of course.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.149
You can have use
of one of the guest chambers.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.610
And consider my manservant
at your disposal.

08:05.069 --> 08:06.904
| will start work immediately.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.038
Yes,

08:16.372 --> 08:20.125
it was all originally designed
for alchemy.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.378
For making gold.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.838
You have an interest in science?

08:25.089 --> 08:27.216
Well, science is knowledge.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.011
It has the answers to everything.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.429
Maybe.

08:35.224 --> 08:38.602
-It can't explain love.
-(CHUCKLES) So, you are in love?

08:39.019 --> 08:43.857
No! I mean... Feelings, emotions...

08:45.275 --> 08:46.902
You seem too bright
to be just a servant.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.947
Oh, well, don't be fooled,
I'm not that bright.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.118
Yes. We will need that.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.706
Now we must hurry to the Lady Morgana

08:59.623 --> 09:02.126
before it is too late.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.479
Put my equipment over there.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.985
Sire, I would be grateful

09:28.110 --> 09:29.820
if you could have everyone
leave the room.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.322
-I require peace and privacy.
-Certainly.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.666
That includes you, Gaius.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.252
But I'm eager to learn
from your methods.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.421
Now is not the time
for giving instruction.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.340
- I will need all my concentration.
-UTHER: Gaius!

10:31.381 --> 10:33.342
Why are you spying on me?

10:33.425 --> 10:35.177
| wasn't. I'm her maidservant.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.474
-Then bring me some water.
-Someone should be with her.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.476
Do you want to be responsible
for her death?

10:42.559 --> 10:45.896
-No, but...
-Then you will bring me some water.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.064
Now,

10:48.816 --> 10:51.235
or she may die.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.919
(CHANTING)

11:33.318 --> 11:35.863
Great news, Your Majesty.

11:35.946 --> 11:39.950
You will be glad to hear,
it is not an inflammation of the brain.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.161
-What is it, then?
-It is a cerebral hemorrhage.

11:44.121 --> 11:47.082
Hemorrhage? I don't think so.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.460
| found this trace of blood in her ear.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.754
UTHER: God in heaven.

11:53.255 --> 11:57.175
The severity depends upon the site
and volume of the bleed.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.802
If not treated,

11:58.886 --> 12:03.724
it can lead to coma
and eventually death.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.226
How could you have missed this?

12:06.310 --> 12:08.645
| didn't see any blood.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.774
Please. Just thank the fates
that you did not administer

12:12.858 --> 12:15.611
more rosemary to stimulate
the circulation.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.238
Can you imagine
what that might have done?

12:20.073 --> 12:22.242
It may have increased the bleed.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.662
-Is there a cure?
-See for yourself.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.331
(DOOR OPENING)

12:27.414 --> 12:30.542
Morgana, this is truly a miracle.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.419
| thought... I really thought...

12:32.502 --> 12:34.546
Oh, you won't get rid of me
that easily.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.173
What exactly
did he give you?

12:36.757 --> 12:40.385
I've no idea, but thank heaven he did.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.223
GAIUS: Edwin?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.144
| want to offer you my congratulations.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.147
-Thank you.
-She was all but dead

12:52.230 --> 12:53.941
and you brought her back to life.

12:55.484 --> 12:59.154
-How exactly did you do that?
-I have developed an elixir

12:59.237 --> 13:01.198
for the treatment
of just such an ailment.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.825
I'd love to know the ingredients.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.996
It is not yet perfected.
You must give me more time

13:08.080 --> 13:10.624
before I make it public.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.542
The injury to your face...

13:14.795 --> 13:17.673
It happened when I was very young.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.885
Perhaps it was
| that treated you for it?

13:22.177 --> 13:25.263
| told you before, we've never met.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.099
Yes, of course.

13:28.850 --> 13:32.396
Well, I'll leave you to your work.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.532
-UTHER: Name your reward.
- Idesire nothing more

13:43.615 --> 13:45.659
than the good health
of my patient, sire.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.744
There must be something
| can do for you.

13:47.995 --> 13:52.082
No, I will wait until the Lady Morgana
is fully recovered

13:52.290 --> 13:54.543
and then I will be on my way.

13:55.085 --> 13:58.588
Why don't you stay a while?
You could live here, at the palace.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.134
No. I feel I would be trespassing,

14:02.426 --> 14:05.846
and you already have a court physician.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.348
I'm sure Gaius would be glad
of your help.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.893
-It is a kind offer, but...
-UTHER: Think about it.

14:11.977 --> 14:14.229
Dine with me later
and give me your decision.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.109
To dine with Your Majesty
would be reward in itself.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.456
-Gaius”?
-Geoffrey.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.334
-I'm here to ask a favor of you.
-Anything for an old friend.

14:37.836 --> 14:41.423
| wish to see the court records
from the time of the Great Purge.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.843
What possible need
can you have for those?

14:44.926 --> 14:47.971
| fear that the past
may have come back to haunt us.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.182
All the more reason
to keep the records hidden.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.601
| know that neither of us
want to remember that time,

14:52.684 --> 14:54.936
but this is a matter of great urgency.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.564
The records are sealed.
They cannot be opened.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.442
-Uther has forbidden it.
-Geoffrey, I beg of you...

15:00.525 --> 15:04.154
I'm sorry, Gaius.
This time you ask too much,

15:04.237 --> 15:05.405
even for me.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.915
Edwin?

16:01.711 --> 16:07.509
(READING INCANTATION)

16:21.606 --> 16:23.692
EDWIN: Very good.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.871
(BEETLES SQUIRMING)

16:37.914 --> 16:39.124
(SPEAKS INCANTATION)

16:45.422 --> 16:48.425
-You have magic.
-It wasn't me, I didn't do anything.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.343
Then how else
did you bring them to life?

16:50.427 --> 16:52.512
Only magic can do such a thing.

16:55.015 --> 16:59.394
These little angels
are how I cured Lady Morgana.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.982
They repaired the damage to her brain.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.400
They saved her life.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.240
-Magic can be a force for good.
- I know.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.202
Then why do you fear it?

17:15.492 --> 17:17.412
Uther has banned it. It's not permitted.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.789
Should I have let Morgana die?

17:19.873 --> 17:21.124
No.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.085
People like us, we have a gift.

17:25.502 --> 17:29.549
Do you not think it should be used
to make this a better world?

17:32.969 --> 17:34.054
Perhaps.

17:41.478 --> 17:42.979
Don't waste your time picking that up.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.901
(CHANTING)

17:55.325 --> 17:57.535
Why waste a talent like that?

17:59.162 --> 18:01.122
And I can teach you.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.255
(CHANTING)

18:22.894 --> 18:25.397
-What do you use this for?
-Gaius doesn't like me to...

18:26.106 --> 18:33.029
A gift like yours should be nurtured,
practiced, enjoyed.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.992
You need someone to help you,
to encourage you.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.204
Perhaps.

18:41.788 --> 18:46.876
Imagine what we could achieve
if we shared our knowledge.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.674
-I should be getting back.
-Of course.

18:53.258 --> 18:57.387
You must promise
to keep our secret safe.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.056
-Of course.
-People like you and |,

19:01.016 --> 19:03.935
we must look after each other.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.906
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

19:17.615 --> 19:19.075
Come In.

19:27.959 --> 19:32.005
Gaius, you've been
a good friend to me over the years.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.424
You've done me many kindnesses.

19:35.717 --> 19:38.970
-I can't deny you this one request.
-The records?

19:39.054 --> 19:41.222
| know you wouldn't ask
unless it was important.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.933
You must believe me,
there's a great deal at stake.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.270
If Uther were to discover this,
he would Kill us both.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.482
It is for Uther's sake
that I make the request.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.192
Trust me, please.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.784
Thank you, old friend.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.961
It's unlike Gaius
to miss something like this.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.714
We all make mistakes.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.635
-Gaius is a great physician.
-The very best.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.807
-Which is what I don't understand...
-What?

20:25.975 --> 20:27.435
It's not for me to speak out of turn.

20:27.519 --> 20:30.855
You saved the life of my ward,
you may speak as you wish.

20:31.731 --> 20:36.236
He has been prescribing
sleeping drafts for Morgana.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.571
-She suffers from bad dreams.
-Yes.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.574
But the dreams
should have been a warning.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.451
You think the two may be connected?

20:43.618 --> 20:45.787
Oh, yes.

20:48.164 --> 20:51.709
-A symptom of the illness?
-I am certain of it, yes.

20:52.669 --> 20:56.631
And those potions,
they masked the problem,

20:56.714 --> 21:00.009
and allowed it to develop
to the point where...

21:04.180 --> 21:05.348
She nearly died.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.351
If you hadn't come along when you did...

21:08.435 --> 21:11.354
But I did. And that is all that matters.

21:11.688 --> 21:15.567
Her life was saved in the nick of time.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.531
Will you undertake a review of his work?

21:23.700 --> 21:26.035
Just to be on the safe side.

21:31.541 --> 21:34.544
If it would put your mind at rest, sire.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.426
(DOOR OPENING)

21:45.805 --> 21:47.974
Have you been up all night?

21:49.184 --> 21:52.270
Yes, but it was worth it.
Where are you going?

21:52.687 --> 21:55.899
Uh... I told Edwin I'd be up at dawn
to collect some supplies.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.319
Well, you better get a move on, then.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.086
Edwin.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.383
Your scar has healed well.

22:22.717 --> 22:26.804
| often wondered what happened
to that poor young boy.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.849
| told you we've never met before.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.311
| didn't realize who you were
until I checked the records.

22:34.145 --> 22:37.023
You used your mother's maiden name.

22:37.273 --> 22:40.443
You are Gregor and Jaden's son.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.154
They were friends of yours.

22:43.238 --> 22:44.948
They were sorcerers.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.158
They practiced magic.

22:47.659 --> 22:50.453
And so did a lot of people
back then, Gaius.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.624
Uther will be furious
when he finds out who you are.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.962
Fine. Fine. Shall we tell him?

22:59.587 --> 23:02.757
Let's go and tell him. Let's tell him.
Let's tell him everything.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.342
Oh! I know.

23:05.802 --> 23:09.138
We could also tell him about Merlin.

23:10.682 --> 23:11.933
Merlin?

23:12.433 --> 23:14.435
You didn't know he was a sorcerer?

23:16.521 --> 23:17.897
Ah!

23:19.566 --> 23:21.317
| wonder what Uther will do.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.612
Probably have him burnt.

23:24.696 --> 23:28.658
-You would betray another sorcerer.
-You did.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.159
When you turned a blind eye

23:30.243 --> 23:33.162
and let my parents die
at the hands of Uther.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.416
At least Merlin
doesn't have a son

23:36.499 --> 23:39.085
who will try to rescue him
from the flames.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.879
You're here to take revenge?

23:42.297 --> 23:46.342
And I have waited a long time.

23:47.135 --> 23:50.722
You think I will sacrifice the king
to save Merlin?

23:51.347 --> 23:53.016
Think about it, Gaius.

23:53.850 --> 23:57.937
But if I find out that you have told
one other person, including the boy,

23:58.646 --> 24:01.190
| will go straight to Uther.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.239
I've got your provisions.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.449
Oh.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.534
Thank you, Merlin.

24:12.285 --> 24:15.455
Gaius was just reminiscing about
old times, weren't you, Gaius?

24:18.541 --> 24:24.505
-Yes.
-But now, I must get back to work.

24:31.638 --> 24:35.767
-I'd better get on with my errands.
-Yes, of course, you must.

24:36.059 --> 24:38.770
-Do you want me to get you anything?
-No, I'm fine.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.148
Just do what Edwin asks.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.238
| have been through
the court medical records

24:49.322 --> 24:52.992
-with a fine-tooth comb, sire.
-And were your findings satisfactory?

24:53.242 --> 24:56.412
With regret, I would have to say
they were not.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.582
-How so?
-Gaius is a great man.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.002
-Thorough, dedicated...
-But?

25:03.378 --> 25:06.130
(SIGHS) His methods are outdated.

25:07.131 --> 25:10.885
He has failed to keep up
with the latest developments.

25:11.552 --> 25:14.472
This has led to a number of errors.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.974
Gaius has served me well for 25 years.

25:17.100 --> 25:20.353
And one cannot blame him
for the infirmity

25:20.436 --> 25:22.063
those years have brought.

25:22.313 --> 25:25.274
Age can be a terrible curse.

25:26.818 --> 25:29.112
Perhaps it is time
to lighten his burdens.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.825
Have you given any more
thought to my offer?

25:35.535 --> 25:40.373
Yes, I have considered
it very carefully.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.959
Allow me some time to do the same.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.472
Uther, you can't do this.

25:56.973 --> 26:00.268
You heard what he said.
Gaius is old. He makes mistakes.

26:00.351 --> 26:02.603
Gaius has treated me
since before I can remember.

26:03.104 --> 26:05.440
-You can't cast him out.
-You would've died if your care

26:05.523 --> 26:08.651
had been left to him.
That is something I cannot bear.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.112
- I know that, but...
-I cannot risk

26:11.195 --> 26:14.323
something like this happening again.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.135
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

27:06.793 --> 27:08.252
Hello?

27:09.629 --> 27:12.048
It is me. Gaius.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.342
(DRAGON APPROACHING)

27:19.847 --> 27:21.516
(CHAINS CLANKING)

27:25.019 --> 27:30.900
How old a man can become,
and yet change so little.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.653
You have not changed either.

27:33.778 --> 27:37.031
Twenty years, almost a lifetime,

27:37.114 --> 27:40.493
to make the short journey back
to where you began.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.079
I'm not here for myself.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.914
The boy.

27:45.873 --> 27:48.251
You know about Merlin?

27:48.334 --> 27:50.878
You have struggled against his destiny,

27:50.962 --> 27:54.924
but you can no more
prevent it than he can.

27:55.216 --> 27:59.053
-So, it is true then.
-Oh, yes.

27:59.136 --> 28:04.141
He and the young Pendragon, one day,
will unite the land of Albion.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.727
But he is in danger.

28:06.811 --> 28:11.315
No, it is my jailer who stands in peril.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.946
Must Uther be sacrificed for the boy?

28:17.029 --> 28:21.617
Their time cannot come
until his has past.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.037
But is that time now?

28:25.788 --> 28:27.582
(CHUCKLING)

28:28.791 --> 28:31.377
That is of your choosing.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.507
| will not choose between them!

28:37.633 --> 28:44.140
Then turn a blind eye.
That is, after all, your talent.

29:02.867 --> 29:06.078
Gaius, my father needs to speak to you.

29:06.329 --> 29:07.371
When?

29:07.830 --> 29:09.165
Immediately.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.628
Sire, is there a problem?
Are you unwell?

29:14.378 --> 29:16.923
This is not an ailment
you can treat me for.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.675
You've been a loyal servant
for many years.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.469
| look on you as a friend.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.804
| regard you in the same way, sire.

29:23.888 --> 29:26.349
You've been here since Arthur's birth

29:28.684 --> 29:30.645
and all that entailed.

29:31.020 --> 29:33.689
What I'm trying to do,
| think, is best for you.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.441
I'm confused, sire.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.401
I'll give you a generous allowance.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.487
Make sure you're looked after.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.405
You're retiring me?

29:41.489 --> 29:42.531
| don't want you to worry.

29:43.032 --> 29:46.577
I'll allow you to continue
living in your chambers

29:46.661 --> 29:49.372
until more suitable accommodation
can be found.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.624
Because I made one mistake?

29:52.249 --> 29:56.379
Although in truth, sire,
it was not a mistake.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.259
- It was...
-Yes, Gaius”?

30:03.135 --> 30:06.097
It was unfortunate. I accept that.

30:07.974 --> 30:11.394
May I ask, who is to be
the next court physician?

30:11.978 --> 30:13.688
UTHER: None of this
was Edwin's idea.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.190
Initially, he turned down the offer.

30:16.816 --> 30:17.858
I'm sure.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.861
It's not been an easy decision,

30:21.404 --> 30:27.243
but a younger man, new ideas...

30:27.868 --> 30:28.953
Yes.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.205
You're hesitant.

30:31.330 --> 30:35.084
Is there a reason
you oppose his appointment?

30:44.927 --> 30:46.220
Sire...

30:47.471 --> 30:51.392
If you have anything to say,
then say it now, Gaius.

30:53.936 --> 30:56.522
UTHER: This is
difficult for both of us.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.115
| thank you for your patronage.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.037
It has been an honor
and a pleasure

31:11.120 --> 31:14.206
to serve your family
for all these years.

31:23.716 --> 31:24.800
Gaius?

31:25.134 --> 31:27.053
Uther cannot do this to you.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.805
-You tried to save Morgana.
-Uther's not to blame.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.557
| will speak to Edwin.
You can work together.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.975
No. You mustn't do anything.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.019
| can't stand by and do nothing.

31:36.145 --> 31:39.648
Uther is right.
It's time I stepped down.

31:42.485 --> 31:44.111
What are you doing?

31:44.487 --> 31:47.156
| cannot stay when
there is no longer a use for me.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.492
You're not leaving?

31:50.076 --> 31:52.328
| believe it's for the best.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.374
Then I will come with you.

32:00.002 --> 32:03.005
Merlin, you are like a son to me.

32:03.130 --> 32:06.759
| never expected such a blessing
so late in life.

32:08.511 --> 32:11.597
And you are more than a father to me.

32:13.682 --> 32:17.269
Then as a father, I must tell you,

32:17.853 --> 32:19.438
you must remain here.

32:19.522 --> 32:21.690
Camelot is where you belong.

32:21.816 --> 32:23.192
But you belong here, too.

32:23.526 --> 32:25.194
Not anymore.

32:27.822 --> 32:31.617
Merlin, you must promise me
you will not waste your gifts.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.286
My gifts mean nothing
without you to guide me.

32:34.411 --> 32:36.622
You have a great destiny.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.667
If I've had a small part
to play in that,

32:39.750 --> 32:41.210
then I'm pleased.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.548
There is so much I've yet to learn.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.551
| need you to teach me.

32:50.886 --> 32:53.430
I'm afraid I am leaving here
tonight, Merlin.

32:53.681 --> 32:55.391
And there is nothing you can do or say

32:56.183 --> 32:58.435
that can persuade me otherwise.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.479
| will not let this happen.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.069
Goodbye, Merlin.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.867
| can't understand why Uther would
sack him over one mistake.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.912
A mistake that nearly killed Morgana.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.248
Besides, it wasn't the only one.

33:20.374 --> 33:21.584
What do you mean?

33:24.086 --> 33:26.338
Edwin said his work
was riddled with errors.

33:26.422 --> 33:29.175
-That's nonsense.
-No one wants Gaius to go.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.552
My father has made his decision.

33:31.635 --> 33:34.221
There is nothing anyone can do.

33:36.557 --> 33:40.186
- I think you'll be very happy here.
-I'm sure I will.

33:41.937 --> 33:44.190
When I reviewed Gaius' work,

33:44.273 --> 33:47.735
| noticed that he has been
prescribing you arnica.

33:48.277 --> 33:51.780
For my shoulders. An old battle wound,

33:51.864 --> 33:53.782
gives me a lot of pain.

33:54.366 --> 33:58.454
May I take the liberty
of providing a new prescription?

33:59.413 --> 34:02.625
It should prove far more effective.

34:02.708 --> 34:03.876
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

34:05.586 --> 34:08.380
It is @ remedy to cure all ills.

34:15.304 --> 34:16.722
Gaius.

34:19.641 --> 34:21.060
You're leaving?

34:21.143 --> 34:23.646
Yes. I'm sorry
| didn't come and say goodbye.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.315
| don't want you to go.
| don't trust Edwin.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.818
There was no blood in Morgana's ear.
He put it there.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.321
He did something to her. I know he did.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.408
You need to be careful
who you say that to.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.911
I'm saying it to you
because you can do something about it.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.580
-I can't.
-But you think the same, don't you?

34:41.956 --> 34:43.206
He's evil.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.083
It's not that simple.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.335
So you're going to turn your back on us?

34:47.835 --> 34:50.089
| have no choice. I'm sorry, Gwen.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.341
In life, you always have a choice.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.094
Sometimes it's easier
to think that you don't.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.848
Well, then, my choice is to leave.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.601
Then I'll miss you.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.066
Goodbye, Gaius.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.157
(BELL TOLLING)

35:31.672 --> 35:33.173
(GROANING SOFTLY)

EDWIN: My lord.

35:53.527 --> 35:54.987
My lord?

35:55.696 --> 35:58.407
It seems the drugs I gave you
have taken hold.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.327
Your body is now paralyzed.

36:01.744 --> 36:04.163
No! Open your eyes, my lord.

36:04.413 --> 36:08.584
| want my face to be the last face
you ever see.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.921
You took my childhood from me.

36:14.006 --> 36:18.469
And now, finally,
| take my parents' revenge.

36:27.061 --> 36:31.774
Within a few hours,
the beetle will eat into your brain.

36:32.149 --> 36:35.694
And you will suffer, as they suffered.

36:39.448 --> 36:44.244
And I long to hear you scream
as they screamed,

36:44.912 --> 36:48.999
the night you gave the order
for the fires to be lit.

36:49.792 --> 36:53.796
With your death,
magic will return to Camelot.

36:58.759 --> 37:01.595
(CHANTING)

37:10.771 --> 37:14.817
Goodbye, Uther Pendragon.

37:34.837 --> 37:37.506
| will not allow you to kill Uther.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.259
You've never had a problem
letting people die before.

37:40.884 --> 37:43.929
Your parents were practicing dark magic,

37:44.388 --> 37:46.140
just like you.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.392
And how do you propose to stop me?

37:50.102 --> 37:51.854
(SPEAKING INCANTATION)

37:53.313 --> 37:54.523
Hmm.

37:54.982 --> 37:56.191
| think you meant...

37:56.358 --> 37:58.026
(PRONOUNCES INCANTATION DIFFERENTLY)

38:02.990 --> 38:04.741
You've forgotten everything, Gaius.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.244
You're getting too old.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.329
| have a cure, though.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.293
(CHANTING)

38:30.309 --> 38:32.978
Merlin! My father has Morgana's illness.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.606
We must find Edwin.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.243
What are you doing?

38:48.702 --> 38:50.954
He was trying to kill the king.
| couldn't let him.

38:51.413 --> 38:53.040
| can rule the kingdom now.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.835
With you at my side,
we can be all-powerful.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.086
Release him.

38:58.212 --> 38:59.588
It's your loss, Merlin.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.941
(CHANTING)

39:28.700 --> 39:30.118
(THUD)

39:40.379 --> 39:41.838
Are you all right?

39:42.839 --> 39:44.132
Yes.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.971
Thank you, Merlin.

39:55.978 --> 39:57.729
What are you doing?

39:57.813 --> 39:59.982
Uther's ill. The same thing Morgana had.

40:00.357 --> 40:02.985
Edwin said he used these
to cure Morgana.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.069
Maybe we can, too.

40:04.361 --> 40:05.821
GAIUS: Elanthia Beetles.

40:05.904 --> 40:06.947
MERLIN: They're magical.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.532
Yes.

40:08.949 --> 40:11.451
They can be enchanted
to enter the brain,

40:11.535 --> 40:15.122
feed on it until they devour
the person's very soul.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.457
We must go to him.

40:19.793 --> 40:22.087
MERLIN: How do we get the beetle out
before it kills him?

40:22.588 --> 40:24.673
It can only be magic.

40:26.008 --> 40:27.926
We can't use magic on Uther,
he'll kill us.

40:28.552 --> 40:31.013
-We don't have a choice.
-Gaius!

40:31.138 --> 40:35.225
There are times when it is necessary.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.477
It is your right.

40:37.978 --> 40:39.187
| don't know how.

40:39.563 --> 40:41.481
If you don't,

40:42.858 --> 40:44.693
he's going to die.

41:15.432 --> 41:17.601
(CHANTING)

41:27.653 --> 41:29.571
What's happening?

41:58.558 --> 42:02.729
Has anyone ever told you
you're a genius?

42:04.189 --> 42:05.899
You certainly haven't.

42:06.733 --> 42:09.444
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

42:22.332 --> 42:24.876
Drink this.
It will help regain your strength.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.962
There's nothing wrong with my strength.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.093
Do you remember them?

42:33.927 --> 42:35.011
His parents?

42:39.766 --> 42:41.893
| remember them all, sire.

42:46.356 --> 42:47.983
Gaius,

42:49.609 --> 42:51.611
once again, you have saved my life.

42:52.112 --> 42:54.156
You've always served me well.

42:56.408 --> 42:59.411
And I know there are things
that I have asked you to do

42:59.911 --> 43:02.456
that you found difficult.

43:02.539 --> 43:05.125
You've always done
what you believe to be right.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.586
| was not right to betray you.

43:09.379 --> 43:10.505
I'm sorry.

43:12.799 --> 43:16.845
From now on I will remember
that in the fight against magic,

43:17.763 --> 43:20.432
you are the one person I can trust.

43:22.934 --> 43:29.441
I, my family and my kingdom,
are deeply indebted to you

43:30.192 --> 43:31.610
and in honor of this,

43:31.693 --> 43:34.446
| not only reinstate you
as court physician,

43:34.738 --> 43:39.659
but henceforth,
you are a freeman of Camelot.

43:53.799 --> 43:56.760
Of course, it's all ridiculous.
| didn't save Uther, you did.

43:56.843 --> 44:00.472
No, no. For once I'm happy
for someone else to take the credit.

44:00.555 --> 44:03.558
You were prepared
to sacrifice your life to save me.

44:03.642 --> 44:05.227
Where did you get that from?

44:05.685 --> 44:06.645
| thought...

44:06.728 --> 44:09.397
No, I didn't do anything.

44:09.481 --> 44:12.567
You saved me and you saved Uther.

44:14.945 --> 44:16.404
Maybe you are a genius.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.490
You think so?

44:18.573 --> 44:21.117
Well, almost.

44:22.494 --> 44:23.995
One day.

44:31.711 --> 44:33.004
(GASPING) Arthur!

44:33.213 --> 44:37.133
| saw Arthur lying underwater
drowning and there was a woman

44:37.801 --> 44:39.511
standing over him watching him die.

44:40.345 --> 44:42.055
We're dealing with the Sidhe.

44:43.223 --> 44:44.766
That does not sound like a good thing.

44:48.228 --> 44:49.896
(SNARLING)
