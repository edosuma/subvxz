Yeah. Base camp, confirm our position.

01:01.843 --> 01:04.176
Are we near the stasis pod?

01:04.276 --> 01:07.210
Well, if it was a snake it'd bite you.

02:58.462 --> 03:01.195

03:01.295 --> 03:03.196
Speaking metaphorically, that is.

03:03.296 --> 03:04.729
Heh.

03:08.064 --> 03:13.064
Hm. It was Rattrap who led us into the box canyon

03:13.164 --> 03:15.865
and nearly to termination.

03:15.965 --> 03:18.065
What are you trying to say, you big lizard head?

03:18.165 --> 03:19.799
That's ridiculous.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.532
Rattrap wouldn't do that.

03:21.632 --> 03:23.800
Well, I'm not so sure.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.600
What?

03:25.700 --> 03:27.267
( tense theme playing )

03:27.367 --> 03:30.434
Rattrap, I wanna have a word with you.

03:30.534 --> 03:32.601
In private.

03:39.869 --> 03:42.669
Tarantulas, have you identified a suitable life form?

03:42.770 --> 03:46.237
Yes, I have indeed. Heh, heh.

03:46.337 --> 03:49.203
Then began scanning and replication.

03:56.438 --> 03:58.272
Hm, lovely.

03:58.372 --> 04:02.039
Scanning, replication and programming complete.

04:02.140 --> 04:06.673
The new Predacon form is everything we could desire.

04:06.774 --> 04:11.141
Meet Blackarachnia.

04:15.208 --> 04:19.909
Blackarachnia, terrorize!

04:24.810 --> 04:28.810
Oh, be still my spinnerets.

04:28.910 --> 04:32.911
Tarantulas, I suspect an ulterior motive

04:33.011 --> 04:35.345
behind your beast form selection.

04:35.445 --> 04:38.146
However, I'm sure that Miss Arachnia

04:38.245 --> 04:40.546
shall make an excellent Predacon.

04:40.645 --> 04:46.414
Yes. Thank you, Maximals, for the protoform gift.

04:46.514 --> 04:48.080
You don't really think

04:48.180 --> 04:50.981
Rattrap is hacking with the Predacons, do you?

04:51.081 --> 04:53.681
Not a chance.

04:53.781 --> 04:55.415
Get scrapped, Optimus.

04:55.515 --> 04:57.548
You think I was working for the Preds?

04:57.648 --> 05:00.115
Ooh, you got a whole other program to run,

05:00.215 --> 05:03.316
you oversized buffoon.

05:03.416 --> 05:06.250
Maximals, Rattrap's loyalty to us

05:06.350 --> 05:08.350
has been brought into serious question.

05:08.450 --> 05:11.784
Oh, come on, Optimus, he's no spy.

05:11.884 --> 05:16.618
The repeated ambush of Maximal operations suggest otherwise.

05:16.718 --> 05:18.152
We'll see.

05:18.252 --> 05:21.419
Rattrap, I'm ordering you on a solo mission.

05:21.519 --> 05:25.253
You're to search for energon in Sector 12.

05:25.353 --> 05:28.454
The lava pits! That's a death sentence, Optimus.

05:28.553 --> 05:31.053
Twelve's one big energon storm.

05:31.154 --> 05:33.721
And within weapon's range of the Predacon ship.

05:33.821 --> 05:36.722
Think of it as a test of loyalty.

05:36.822 --> 05:40.889
Eh, thanks for nothing, comrades.

05:40.989 --> 05:43.156
I'm blowing this taco stand.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.824
I know you're hot about losing the pod,

05:50.924 --> 05:52.957
but you don't really think...?

05:53.057 --> 05:56.191
This mission should answer that question.

05:56.291 --> 05:59.492
Once and for all.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.659
( ominous theme playing )

06:05.026 --> 06:07.393
Maximal command, this is Rattrap.

06:07.493 --> 06:11.894
My recon mission indicates nothing here but mountain rock.

06:11.994 --> 06:13.194
You happy?

06:13.294 --> 06:14.828
One more sweep, Rattrap.

06:14.928 --> 06:15.961
Then bring it in.

06:16.062 --> 06:20.262
Check Sector 12.8 by 122-9.

06:20.362 --> 06:24.062
Ah, the simple pleasures of code-breaking.

06:24.163 --> 06:29.797
Yes. Terrorsaur, would you pay our Maximal friend a visit?

06:36.064 --> 06:38.231
Nope, no activity here.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.698
Energon or otherwise.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.399
( grunts )

06:45.499 --> 06:48.400
Oh! Whoa! Hey, scrap that last report.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.001
Engaging Terrorsaur.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.334
Terrorsaur, terrorize!

06:52.435 --> 06:54.901
Rattrap, maximize!

06:56.535 --> 06:59.636
His comm-link's still open, and he's under attack.

06:59.735 --> 07:03.170
Told you he was no Predacon clone.

07:04.469 --> 07:07.270
( screeching, laughing )

07:07.370 --> 07:11.070

07:18.372 --> 07:19.705

( grunts )

07:26.440 --> 07:28.274
( grunts )

07:28.374 --> 07:31.841
Prepare to terminate, Maximal!

07:31.941 --> 07:34.241
Wait!

07:35.341 --> 07:37.341
I beg for mercy.

07:37.442 --> 07:39.075
What?

07:39.176 --> 07:42.142
Mercy? At what price?

07:42.242 --> 07:43.843
You name it.

07:43.943 --> 07:46.110
I got no links with the Maximals anymore.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.743
I'm a free agent.

07:47.843 --> 07:53.677
Well, well, finally a Maximal with logic circuits.

07:53.777 --> 07:56.211
Very well, I will spare you

07:56.311 --> 07:59.745
in exchange for certain considerations.

07:59.845 --> 08:03.312
All right, what have I got to lose?

08:03.412 --> 08:05.013
I'll do whatever you say.

08:05.113 --> 08:08.013
I'll even become a Predacon.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.347
Rattrap? No, he couldn't.

08:10.447 --> 08:13.548
Will you still defend your friend?

08:13.648 --> 08:17.215
Or will you see him for what he is, a traitor?

08:17.315 --> 08:19.649
You're a fine one to talk.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.415
Rattrap wouldn't...

08:30.517 --> 08:32.017
( laughing )

08:34.018 --> 08:36.018
( Terrorsaur laughing over radio )

08:40.385 --> 08:42.219
( growling )

08:49.554 --> 08:51.854
Hear me, Predacons.

08:51.954 --> 08:56.655
I present you with that which will tip the balance of power

08:56.755 --> 08:59.055
in the battle against the Maximals.

08:59.155 --> 09:03.923
I present you my lieutenant, Rattrap.

09:04.023 --> 09:07.256
With the added power of Blackarachnia,

09:07.356 --> 09:10.356
who was retrieved by my skill,

09:10.457 --> 09:14.691
and Rattrap, who has sworn personal fealty to me,

09:14.791 --> 09:17.425
we shall defeat the Maximals.

09:17.525 --> 09:20.425
But my gifts to you do not come free.

09:20.525 --> 09:24.393
In return, I shall become your leader.

09:24.493 --> 09:26.259
MEGATRON: You sniveling toady.

09:26.359 --> 09:29.294
This Maximal isn't your lieutenant.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.927
No. He must be a spy.

09:32.027 --> 09:34.128
Yes. He can't be trusted.

09:34.228 --> 09:36.195

09:40.695 --> 09:43.763
Shouldn't have turned your back, big mouth.

Now you'll find your servo circuits scrapped.

09:47.464 --> 09:49.397

09:49.497 --> 09:53.697
Transformation has been disabled as well.

09:53.797 --> 09:57.131
The better for you to worship your new leader.

09:57.231 --> 09:58.665
And his lieutenant.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.766
( laughing )

10:01.866 --> 10:04.066
Megatron is obsolete.

10:04.166 --> 10:07.667
All Predacons will swear fealty to me.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.667
Not Scorponok.

10:09.767 --> 10:12.501
Scorponok loyal to Megatron.

10:12.601 --> 10:15.935
Then you are an even bigger fool than you look.

10:16.035 --> 10:19.168
Direct as well as lovely.

10:19.268 --> 10:21.002
( groans )

10:21.102 --> 10:23.569
But we should debate this in private.

10:23.669 --> 10:25.936
Not in front of the Maximal.

10:26.036 --> 10:27.336
Very well.

10:27.436 --> 10:30.803
Remove him and the deposed Megatron

10:30.903 --> 10:33.404
to the lower chamber.

10:33.504 --> 10:35.438
( ominous theme playing )

10:35.537 --> 10:37.405
What do you mean go after Rattrap?

10:37.505 --> 10:38.505
You mean rescue him?

10:38.605 --> 10:41.306
Why? Let him go.

10:41.406 --> 10:44.406
He's too dangerous a weapon to fall into Predacon hands.

10:44.506 --> 10:46.506
Agreed.

10:46.606 --> 10:49.607
He should be neutralized and returned here

10:49.707 --> 10:51.874
to answer for his treachery.

10:51.974 --> 10:56.274
And to be brought to justice.

10:56.374 --> 10:58.374
( dramatic theme playing )

11:06.243 --> 11:09.376
A Maximal traitor and a deposed Megatron.

11:09.477 --> 11:13.244
Yes, we are an unlikely pair.

11:13.344 --> 11:16.411
I will consider your fate after my restoration.

11:24.779 --> 11:27.546

11:27.646 --> 11:31.814

11:31.913 --> 11:34.981
for his personal escape.

11:37.215 --> 11:39.181
And the wise Maximal traitor

11:39.281 --> 11:43.649
always makes sure he's carrying a handy infiltration kit.

11:43.749 --> 11:47.449
Rattrap, maximize.

12:14.221 --> 12:15.754
( growling )

12:15.855 --> 12:17.355
TERRORSAUR: You fools.

12:17.454 --> 12:20.322
With the Maximal spy and Blackarachnia,

12:20.422 --> 12:23.323
we could destroy the Maximals once and for all.

13:03.596 --> 13:05.996
Megatron is our true leader.

TERRORSAUR: Enough. I am your new leader.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.702
Well, what are we waiting for?

13:41.802 --> 13:44.636
Yes, why do we not attack

13:44.736 --> 13:47.836
and draw out the traitor Rattrap?

13:47.936 --> 13:50.537
We attack on my command.

COMPUTER: Scanning for Maximal frequencies.

14:00.072 --> 14:02.005

( beeping ) Hey, what's that?

16:06.193 --> 16:07.560
We attack now.

16:07.659 --> 16:09.426
Maximize!

16:09.527 --> 16:12.094
( growls )

16:13.994 --> 16:16.494
( yells ) Maximal attack!

16:16.594 --> 16:19.495
Why were we not warned by the code breaker?

16:19.594 --> 16:21.028
Where's Tarantulas?

16:21.128 --> 16:23.929
Maximal code-breaking deactivated.

16:24.029 --> 16:25.530
Shields damaged.

16:25.629 --> 16:27.630
( yelling )

16:29.196 --> 16:32.764
Well, leader, how shall we respond?

16:32.863 --> 16:37.231
Megatron, you-- You will allow me to lead?

16:37.331 --> 16:38.532
( laughing )

16:38.632 --> 16:41.099
A wise tyrant always allows a fool

16:41.198 --> 16:43.399
to take the lead in a crisis.

16:43.499 --> 16:46.866
Uh, release my lieutenant

16:46.966 --> 16:49.300
and prepare to counter-attack.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.333
TERRORSAUR: Predacons, terrorize!

16:52.433 --> 16:55.134
( dramatic rock theme playing )

17:03.435 --> 17:04.636
We're outnumbered.

17:04.736 --> 17:06.536
OPTIMUS: Then transform the proto-Maximal.

17:06.636 --> 17:09.837
We have a secret weapon. Fight on!

17:15.504 --> 17:16.704
( yells )

17:19.172 --> 17:22.605
It's time to prove your loyalty to the Predacons in battle.

17:22.705 --> 17:24.472
Fire on Optimus!

17:55.510 --> 17:57.411

17:57.511 --> 17:59.545
Another time.

17:59.645 --> 18:00.912
( grunts )

18:03.712 --> 18:04.746
Oh, no.

18:04.846 --> 18:10.280
I have awaited this meeting, traitor.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.347
Prepare to terminate.

18:13.447 --> 18:15.014
No!

18:15.114 --> 18:17.347
Time for the final test, Maximal.

18:17.447 --> 18:22.215
Yes. Predacon hero or Maximal spy?

18:22.315 --> 18:24.582
Destroy the traitor Dinobot.

18:26.149 --> 18:28.650
( growls )

18:28.750 --> 18:29.850
( growls )

18:29.950 --> 18:31.783
TERRORSAUR: He is my lieutenant.

18:31.883 --> 18:36.517
Destroy him. I command you.

18:36.617 --> 18:38.485
( screeches )

18:38.585 --> 18:40.852
( growls )

18:44.685 --> 18:46.686
( groaning )

18:48.253 --> 18:50.086
Now! Get Rattrap out of there!

18:50.186 --> 18:52.954

( dramatic rock theme playing )

18:55.154 --> 18:57.087
( Waspinator and Scorponok groan )

18:57.188 --> 18:59.555
RHINOX: Let's go!

19:01.188 --> 19:03.955
Mission accomplished. Return to base.

19:04.989 --> 19:08.056
( Terrorsaur gasping )

19:08.156 --> 19:12.323
MEGATRON: Hm. Now, which of you glorious victors

19:12.423 --> 19:15.691
would still follow this fool's lead?

19:18.724 --> 19:21.191
Yes. So I calculated.

19:21.292 --> 19:24.859
And thus ends the glorious reign of Terrorsaur.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.793
A lost battle, a missing Blackarachnia,

19:27.892 --> 19:33.193
and who knows what damage inflicted by the Maximal spy.

19:33.294 --> 19:36.861
Oh, my aching head.

19:36.961 --> 19:38.295
( suspenseful theme playing )

19:38.395 --> 19:42.328
Now I will terminate the traitor myself.

19:42.428 --> 19:43.828
( gasps )

19:43.929 --> 19:46.196
No. Allow me...

19:47.362 --> 19:49.563
To congratulate him.

19:52.463 --> 19:54.830
Well done, Rattrap.

19:55.964 --> 19:57.864
You have the chip?

19:57.964 --> 20:00.464
Eh, it's a Maximal decoder.

20:00.565 --> 20:03.232
They must've recovered it from a wreckage crash.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.699
No wonder they hacked our communications.

20:05.799 --> 20:08.033
They were using our decoder.

20:08.133 --> 20:11.867
You mean, his capture, his betrayal...

20:11.967 --> 20:13.700
were all a setup?

20:13.800 --> 20:15.434
Eh.

20:15.534 --> 20:17.634
Why didn't you tell us?

20:17.734 --> 20:20.601
We had to keep it a secret. To keep his cover safe.

20:20.701 --> 20:22.201
Especially during the battle.

20:22.302 --> 20:25.936
Although you didn't need to make it that believable.

20:26.036 --> 20:29.102
Hey, what can I say?

20:29.202 --> 20:31.070
I was trying to miss.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.571
Hm.

20:32.670 --> 20:35.070
Ha!
