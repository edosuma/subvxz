(radio) Senator Barry Goldwater
is campaigning in Colorado.

02:36.327 --> 02:41.242
The Warren Commission, almost a full
year after the Kennedy assassination...

02:43.047 --> 02:46.198
- Glenn, it's time.
- No, just a little more.

02:46.287 --> 02:50.326
If you don't get up right now,
I'm gonna cut one of your piano strings.

02:50.407 --> 02:52.318
Ugh...

02:52.407 --> 02:54.762
- What time is it?
- Quarter to seven.

02:55.727 --> 02:58.321
- A quarter to seven!
- Mm-hm.

02:58.407 --> 03:00.398
Oh, God.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.397
Does the sun really come out this early?

03:03.487 --> 03:08.163
It was a surprise to me, too. I took
a picture in case it never happens again.

03:08.247 --> 03:12.320
- Nobody gets up this early.
- Oh, yes, they do.

03:12.407 --> 03:16.082
Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please, please, please, please!

03:16.167 --> 03:19.842
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- No, no, no! This is a stupid idea.

03:19.927 --> 03:22.646
Oh, this is definitely not my scene, Iris.

03:23.287 --> 03:27.166
It's just a gig. If it doesn't work,
you can try something else.

03:27.927 --> 03:30.760
- What time am I supposed to be there?
- 7.30.

03:30.847 --> 03:32.838
7.30!

03:33.447 --> 03:37.565
What kind of people like to
go to work at 7.30 in the morning?

(~ `One, Two, Three` by Len Barry)

03:45.887 --> 03:47.878

~ Oh, thats how elementary

03:53.127 --> 03:55.118

- ~ A, B, C

04:11.487 --> 04:14.285
~ Falling in love with you was

04:14.967 --> 04:16.958
~ Easy for me

04:18.647 --> 04:21.081
~ And you can do it, too

Hi. I'm Glenn Holland.
I'm the new music teacher.

04:32.087 --> 04:33.805
Vice Principal Wolters.

04:35.087 --> 04:37.078
Holy cow!

04:38.927 --> 04:40.519
- A Corvair.
- Yeah.

04:40.607 --> 04:43.360
I take it you didn"t read
Ralph Nader"s book.

04:43.447 --> 04:46.439
Well, unless Ralph
is willing to buy me a new car,

04:46.527 --> 04:49.917
I'm gonna have to stick with this one
until the wheels fall off.

04:50.007 --> 04:53.204
Well, you may not have to
wait that long. Heh-heh.

04:54.927 --> 04:57.521
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

04:57.607 --> 05:00.440
- ~ Its easy
- ~ It`s so easy

05:00.527 --> 05:04.520
~ Like taking candy from a baby

05:05.007 --> 05:06.998
You look lost, Mr Holland.

05:08.447 --> 05:11.166
Helen Jacobs. Remember? I hired you.

05:11.247 --> 05:13.442
Oh!

05:13.527 --> 05:18.999
Of course you did. I'm sorry. It was not
that I'm lost. I was just looking for the...

05:19.087 --> 05:23.000
- Well, yes, of course I'm lost.
- What an auspicious beginning.

05:23.567 --> 05:25.558
This way.

05:26.047 --> 05:29.403
Your first day as a teacher,
Mr Holland. Excited?

05:29.487 --> 05:32.638
Nervous. Boy, I never thought I"d be here.

05:32.727 --> 05:34.843
No? Why not?

05:34.927 --> 05:38.237
Well... like most people,
I only got my teaching certificate

05:38.327 --> 05:40.682
so I"d have something to fall back on.

05:40.767 --> 05:43.565
This isn't a drive-in, Mr Claridge.
Hands off!

05:43.647 --> 05:47.925
You know, Mr Holland, I don't think
of teaching as a fallback position.

05:48.007 --> 05:50.840
- No, no...
- I grow nervous around people who do.

05:50.927 --> 05:53.885
I'm... I'm really very happy
to be here. Really.

05:53.967 --> 05:59.439
Good. You"ll drop by my office later on.
I have a list of students you"ll be advising.

05:59.527 --> 06:04.078
Advising? Can I ask when
I'm supposed to be doing this advising?

06:04.167 --> 06:08.126
that's for you and the student to arrange.
You meet your orchestra when?

06:08.207 --> 06:10.198
Fifth period.

06:11.407 --> 06:13.557
- Are they any good?
- They try hard.

06:13.647 --> 06:17.526
By the way, I'll need a complete
lesson plan from you by Friday.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.203
- Right.
- For September and October.

06:20.287 --> 06:21.436
Right.

06:32.527 --> 06:34.245
(door opens)

06:44.287 --> 06:46.278
(school bell)

06:59.847 --> 07:03.965
All right. People, come on,
let"s take our seats a little quicker, please.

07:04.047 --> 07:07.756
A little quicker. We"re losing time.
Come on in, come on in.

07:07.847 --> 07:09.838
My name is Mr Holland.

07:10.967 --> 07:15.245
This, of course, is a title of courtesy
that I will extend back to you -

07:15.487 --> 07:19.036
"Mr" or "Miss",
as the circumstances allow.

07:19.127 --> 07:21.118
Welcome to Music Appreciation.

07:21.207 --> 07:26.520
This is a class in which we will be
studying the history of music.

07:26.607 --> 07:30.725
Um, who would like to give me
a definition of what music is?

07:32.447 --> 07:34.438
Any music. What do you think?

07:35.487 --> 07:40.800
What do they think that music is
in... in general? What do they think?

07:40.887 --> 07:42.878
Anybody?

07:44.567 --> 07:46.558
Nobody?

07:47.087 --> 07:51.365
OK. Let"s, uh... let"s go to the text.

07:52.167 --> 07:56.524
And we turn to page, um... four.

07:56.607 --> 08:04.924
And we read that "Music is sound
in melodic or harmonic combinations,

08:05.007 --> 08:07.680
whether produced
by voice or instrument. "

08:09.047 --> 08:11.038
Now, questions?

08:12.047 --> 08:14.277
Anybody... at all?

08:17.167 --> 08:19.044
No?

08:19.127 --> 08:20.037
Hm?

08:20.127 --> 08:21.799
Good.

08:21.887 --> 08:23.764
All righty, uh...

08:23.847 --> 08:30.685
Now, I just... you know, I just...
want you all to relax, have a little fun.

08:30.767 --> 08:33.486
We"re not here to impress each other.

08:33.567 --> 08:36.034
OK. All right, let"s get ready.

08:38.246 --> 08:40.238
Everyone? Come on.

08:43.167 --> 08:45.556
You ready?

08:46.087 --> 08:48.078
OK, here we go.

08:48.527 --> 08:51.837
(~ discordant `Symphony No 5
in C Minor``` by Beethoven)

09:33.967 --> 09:35.639
It was good.

09:35.727 --> 09:38.366
Miss Aronson.
Would you stand up, please?

09:39.207 --> 09:41.004
Stand up, please.

09:41.087 --> 09:46.081
Is that skirt regulation length?
On your knees, both of you, right now.

09:47.247 --> 09:51.240
I thought so. Come with me to the
principal"s office. You are going home.

09:51.327 --> 09:53.795
You can come back
when you"re dressed properly.

09:53.887 --> 09:55.639
- You"re not being fair.
- I am.

09:55.727 --> 09:58.639
If I allow you to do it,
everyone is allowed to do it.

09:58.727 --> 10:00.922
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:03.127 --> 10:05.118
Come on, out of my way.

10:07.367 --> 10:10.677
- Teachers don't wait.
- Pardon me?

10:10.767 --> 10:13.679
High school is not a democracy.
Teachers don't wait.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.883
Bill Meister. Phys ed.

10:15.967 --> 10:18.606
- Glenn Holland. Music teacher.
- Hi.

10:22.287 --> 10:25.279
- There you go.
- Oh, my God!

10:25.367 --> 10:29.280
- What is this?
- It's Monday. It's Turkey Spam Surprise.

10:29.847 --> 10:31.883
You could mortar walls with it.

10:31.967 --> 10:34.879
Word of advice: always bring a bag lunch.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.435
- Where"s yours?
- I ate it in second period.

10:37.527 --> 10:40.519
Sylvie! don't tease me. I need extra.

10:41.087 --> 10:43.647
So what have you been doin"
for the last ten years?

10:43.727 --> 10:46.719
I've been playing music.
Been on the road.

10:46.807 --> 10:51.961
You know, um... clubs and weddings
and bar mitzvahs. That sort of thing.

10:52.047 --> 10:55.926
Wait a minute. I bet you met
a ton of chicks in those clubs, huh?

10:56.007 --> 10:59.363
So you"re in these clubs,
there are all these women there...

10:59.447 --> 11:02.041
- Why"d you become a teacher?
- Well...

11:02.127 --> 11:04.880
Actually, I started teaching
because I was hoping

11:04.967 --> 11:09.165
it would give me some free time to do
some composing. I'm a composer.

11:12.527 --> 11:15.200
- What? what's so funny?
- Oh, the free time.

11:17.367 --> 11:20.803
Glenn, I can't remember
the last time I had that was free.

11:45.927 --> 11:47.918
(Iris) I've got it all figured out.

11:48.007 --> 11:51.158
With your salary, plus what I take in
with the photography,

11:51.247 --> 11:53.681
in four years we should have
enough for you to quit

11:53.767 --> 11:58.921
and do nothing but compose music
and become famous and make us rich.

11:59.007 --> 12:02.238
- I'll never make it.
- I made us $32 today.

12:02.327 --> 12:06.445
Big deal. I made 32 kids
sleep with their eyes open.

12:06.527 --> 12:08.518
Oh, right there! Yeah.

12:09.527 --> 12:11.961
Right there. Yeah.

12:16.607 --> 12:22.045
Iris... I think this is gonna be
a lot rougher gig than I originally thought.

12:25.047 --> 12:30.075
You know, when I was in high school...
I wanted to be someplace else, you know.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.044
Anyplace.

12:32.127 --> 12:36.086
It never occurred to me that
my teachers would feel the same way.

12:36.887 --> 12:39.447
Well... you can still quit.

12:39.527 --> 12:44.442
- Nah. We"ve been through all that.
- The band"s getting pretty good.

12:44.527 --> 12:47.246
We could play Holiday Inns
for the rest of our lives.

12:47.327 --> 12:51.366
- Or Los Angeles.
- I don't wanna be a studio musician.

12:52.327 --> 12:54.477
So, It's four years" teaching, then.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.478
Come here.

13:07.807 --> 13:09.798
When you were in high school...

13:10.367 --> 13:13.564
did you ever wonder
if your teachers got it on at night?

13:13.647 --> 13:17.526
When I was in high school
my teachers were all priests and nuns.

13:18.647 --> 13:23.960
I had such a crush on Mr Griffith.
He could"ve taken me home any time.

13:24.047 --> 13:26.277
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

13:26.367 --> 13:28.676
And who was this Mr Griffith?

13:28.767 --> 13:32.043
Oh... he was my music teacher.

13:37.087 --> 13:39.157
(~ woodwind section plays)

13:49.687 --> 13:51.678
(~ discordant notes)

13:55.407 --> 13:57.045
OK. OK.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.925
That wasn't bad. That wasn't bad at all.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.282
- Miss...? I'm sorry.
- Lang.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.927
- Pardon me?
- Lang. Gertrude Lang.

14:05.687 --> 14:11.762
OK. Miss Lang, um... would you
take it from bar 37, please?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.518
(~ discordant notes)

14:31.327 --> 14:32.999
(whispering and giggling)

14:33.087 --> 14:34.600
OK. OK.

14:34.687 --> 14:37.918
- (school bell)
- Good. Good. that's enough for today.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.680
I'll see you all tomorrow. Very good work.

14:40.767 --> 14:44.237
Miss Lang? Would you mind
hanging for a moment, please?

14:52.407 --> 14:55.797
You seem to be having a little trouble
getting through the break.

14:55.887 --> 14:58.003
I know.

14:58.087 --> 15:00.840
- How long have you been playing?
- Three years.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.676
Really?

15:04.767 --> 15:06.166
Uh...

15:06.247 --> 15:09.205
Do you find that you get
all the practice time that you need?

15:09.287 --> 15:11.676
I practise constantly, yeah.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.038
Well...

15:18.047 --> 15:22.359
then I think... I think maybe
you and I should find some time

15:22.447 --> 15:24.597
to work on an individual basis.

15:24.687 --> 15:27.406
- That would be great.
- I don't have a lot of time, but...

15:27.487 --> 15:31.719
that's OK. Whatever you can give me.
I really, really wanna do good at this.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.798
I bet you do. Um...

15:34.407 --> 15:39.925
Well, come in about a half-hour before
first period tomorrow and we"ll just start...

15:40.007 --> 15:44.159
OK. All right. Thank you...
thank you very much. Thanks.

16:11.007 --> 16:15.319
When a flat precedes a note, like this,

16:15.407 --> 16:19.923
it indicates that the note
is to be played a half-step lower.

16:20.887 --> 16:22.798
A piece based in F major

16:22.887 --> 16:26.323
should have a flat sign
at the beginning of every stave.

17:25.607 --> 17:28.644
These tests... are pathetic.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.486
"Name an American composer. "

17:35.567 --> 17:38.957
Miss Swedlin, your answer was...?

17:39.047 --> 17:40.526
"Bach"?

17:40.607 --> 17:43.075
"Johann Sebastian Bach. "

17:45.367 --> 17:47.517
Oh, this is my favourite one.

17:47.607 --> 17:51.725
"How do you know
what key a concerto is in?"

17:52.607 --> 17:58.762
Mr Mims, your answer was
"Look on the front page?"

17:59.847 --> 18:03.681
Now, this question mark -
was that because you weren"t sure?

18:03.767 --> 18:08.477
Or because your English skills are on
the same level as your musical theory?

18:08.567 --> 18:12.003
These tests are a waste
of my time, and yours!

18:12.087 --> 18:15.045
No kidding! I"d rather be somewhere else.

18:15.127 --> 18:19.200
Mr Sullivan! Why don't you pay a visit
to Mr Wolters, right now!

18:19.287 --> 18:21.562
Get your books and get outta here!

18:25.287 --> 18:28.597
As for the rest of you,
get your textbooks out.

18:28.687 --> 18:33.363
We"re gonna go over these answers
one by one until you get them right.

18:33.447 --> 18:35.438
(school bell)

18:55.087 --> 18:57.078
(~ discordant clarinet)

19:06.047 --> 19:08.322
Give it up, Miss Lang.

19:10.847 --> 19:12.838
(sobbing)

19:34.087 --> 19:36.078
I meant for the day.

19:36.727 --> 19:39.719
- I meant "Give it up for the day. "
- I know what you meant.

19:39.807 --> 19:42.401
Then... why are you crying?

19:42.487 --> 19:44.478
I'm terrible. I'm...

19:45.087 --> 19:49.638
I'm terrible. I practise till my lips swell up,
but all I make is noise.

19:49.727 --> 19:52.161
It takes work
to learn a musical instrument.

19:52.247 --> 19:55.319
I just... I just wanna be good at something.

19:55.767 --> 19:59.123
My sister"s got a ballet scholarship
to go to Juilliard,

19:59.207 --> 20:03.644
and my brother"s going to Notre Dame
on a football scholarship.

20:03.727 --> 20:07.276
My mother"s won the blue ribbon
for watercolours at the state fair

20:07.367 --> 20:09.927
so many times
they"ve retired the category.

20:10.007 --> 20:13.158
My father"s got the most
beautiful voice. he's...

20:15.727 --> 20:18.116
I'm the only one in my family who"s...

20:19.127 --> 20:21.561
I... I just can't...

20:22.327 --> 20:23.760
(sobbing)

20:23.847 --> 20:26.600
It doesn't make any difference anyway. I...

20:33.567 --> 20:36.479
Mr Holland!
Just the man I was looking for.

20:36.567 --> 20:39.127
We"re forming a textbook committee
for next year.

20:39.207 --> 20:43.564
I would like to have your suggestions. We
meet next Tuesday night in the library.

20:43.647 --> 20:46.764
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Jacobs.
I'm very busy on Tuesday night.

20:46.847 --> 20:48.485
Uh-huh?

20:48.567 --> 20:52.162
You know, for a good four or five months
now, I've been watching you.

20:52.247 --> 20:55.444
I've never seen a teacher
sprint for the parking lot

20:55.527 --> 20:58.121
with more speed and enthusiasm
than his students.

20:58.207 --> 21:00.516
Perhaps you should be our track coach.

21:00.607 --> 21:04.520
Mrs Jacobs, I get here on time
every morning, don't I?

21:04.607 --> 21:06.882
I'm doing my job the best I can.

21:07.007 --> 21:11.000
A teacher is two jobs.
Fill young minds with knowledge, yes.

21:11.087 --> 21:14.318
But, more important,
give those minds a compass

21:14.407 --> 21:16.398
so that knowledge doesn't go to waste.

21:16.487 --> 21:18.876
I don't know what you do
with the knowledge,

21:18.967 --> 21:21.435
but as a compass, you"re stuck.

21:26.327 --> 21:31.196
I really hate that woman!
And I hate teaching, Iris. I hate it.

21:31.287 --> 21:33.801
Nobody could teach
these children. Nobody!

21:34.127 --> 21:36.243
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

21:36.327 --> 21:41.606
They just sit there, staring up at me.
there's no there there. I've been trying...

21:41.687 --> 21:45.441
You played a lot of tough houses.
When they didn"t listen, did you quit?

21:45.527 --> 21:49.679
Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Aren"t we
supposed to be on the same side?

21:49.767 --> 21:51.485
I am.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.558
It's just that I...

21:54.247 --> 21:56.203
I...

21:56.887 --> 21:58.957
- (sighs)
- What?

22:01.967 --> 22:03.958
I'm pregnant.

22:05.927 --> 22:13.766
I wasn't... I wasn't sure if I was,
but I went to the doctor and I... I am.

22:16.687 --> 22:18.678
We are.

22:22.687 --> 22:24.678
S...

22:25.207 --> 22:27.038
Say something.

22:32.487 --> 22:34.842
Wow.

22:56.047 --> 22:58.038
Iris...

22:58.807 --> 23:03.403
- Iris...
- I... I don't know. I knew!

23:03.487 --> 23:08.959
- I knew you wouldn"t be, but I just...
- Iris, it just took me by surprise, that's all.

23:15.807 --> 23:18.275
Let me tell you a story, OK?

23:20.447 --> 23:24.918
When I was 15 years old
I used to hang out at a local record store.

23:25.007 --> 23:29.637
There was this guy who worked there
who thought he knew what I liked,

23:29.727 --> 23:34.164
and he handed me this album one day
and it was John Coltrane.

23:36.007 --> 23:38.726
So I took it home
and I put it on the machine.

23:39.407 --> 23:42.638
And I hated it. I mean, I really hated it.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.083
I just didn"t get it.

23:46.687 --> 23:50.236
So I... played it again.

23:51.287 --> 23:53.881
I played it again, and I played it again...

23:55.007 --> 23:59.444
and then... I just couldn"t stop playin" it.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.196
I kept listening to those notes.

24:06.527 --> 24:13.046
And I realised that... that's what
I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

24:14.207 --> 24:16.198
You know?

24:17.287 --> 24:19.278
Make music.

24:32.167 --> 24:34.158
What am I tryin" to say?

24:36.647 --> 24:38.717
Look, Iris...

24:38.807 --> 24:43.835
Look, you... you tell me that...
we"re gonna have a baby.

24:45.847 --> 24:47.838
Well...

24:50.047 --> 24:54.518
that's like... falling in love
with John Coltrane...

24:56.487 --> 24:58.478
all over again.

25:03.167 --> 25:07.718
If that is a lie,
that is the sweetest lie I ever heard.

25:16.647 --> 25:19.559
- (school bell)
- Let"s take our seats, please.

25:22.327 --> 25:27.037
Anybody here know the difference
between the lonian and the Dorian scale?

25:27.767 --> 25:29.758
Anybody?

25:30.807 --> 25:32.206
(chuckles)

25:32.287 --> 25:34.278
I just wanted to confirm the fact

25:34.367 --> 25:39.122
that I've made absolutely no impact
on you in the last five months.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.675
- Mr Sullivan.
- Yeah.

25:45.127 --> 25:47.960
What kind of music
do you like to listen to?

25:48.047 --> 25:50.800
- Um...
- don't be afraid.

25:53.127 --> 25:54.879
Rock"n"roll.

25:54.967 --> 25:57.322
- What about you?
- Rock"n"roll.

26:00.047 --> 26:02.515
- You?
- Classical.

26:02.607 --> 26:04.882
- Brown-noser.
- (laughter)

26:06.087 --> 26:08.681
Does anybody here like
Johann Sebastian Bach?

26:09.567 --> 26:11.683
Other than you?

26:11.767 --> 26:17.080
I'll bet all of you, whether you know it or
not, already like Johann Sebastian Bach.

26:17.567 --> 26:20.035
(~ `A Lover`s Concerto```)

26:24.487 --> 26:27.524
- what's this called?
- (all) "A Lover's Concerto".

26:28.247 --> 26:30.886
- Who wrote it?
- The Toys.

26:30.967 --> 26:32.161
Wrong!

26:32.247 --> 26:38.117
That was "Minuet in G", and it was written
by Johann Sebastian Bach.

26:38.207 --> 26:40.198
(~ `Minuet in G Major``` by Bach)

26:44.567 --> 26:46.558
Can you hear it?

26:48.887 --> 26:50.878
~ Bom-bom, bom-bom, bom

26:51.927 --> 26:53.963
And he wrote it in 1725.

26:54.047 --> 26:57.642
They are both prime examples
of the lonian scale.

26:58.207 --> 27:02.359
Now listen... and see if
you can hear the connective tissue

27:02.447 --> 27:05.644
between what I just played and this.

27:05.887 --> 27:07.525
(~ honky-tonk)

27:30.487 --> 27:34.605
.. and they were answering questions
and it was so much fun.

27:34.687 --> 27:38.805
It was rowdy, you know.
It was... it was just great.

27:41.647 --> 27:44.400
Hey, hey, hey! What do we think, huh?

27:44.487 --> 27:47.923
And it only took two tries and three hours.

27:48.007 --> 27:50.521
You didn"t realise
you"d married such a handy man!

27:50.607 --> 27:52.802
But now we really don't have any space.

27:56.447 --> 28:01.316
Well... how would you feel
if we moved into a house?

28:02.487 --> 28:05.206
- You"re kidding?
- No.

28:06.327 --> 28:08.921
But we can't afford that.

28:09.007 --> 28:13.762
If we used our savings account we could,
and I taught driver"s ed in the summer.

28:13.847 --> 28:18.045
- You were gonna compose this summer.
- Well, we could make it work.

28:18.287 --> 28:21.279
- It"d mean taking the crib apart again.
- Never!

28:22.167 --> 28:24.727
I'll tear a wall down first.

28:25.807 --> 28:28.241
It's up to you.

28:28.327 --> 28:30.397
- I think we should do it.
- Really?!

28:32.127 --> 28:35.483
Play the song you wrote
that made me fall in love with you.

28:35.567 --> 28:38.161
The song that made you
fall in love with me?

28:39.127 --> 28:43.166
The song that made you...
Oh, yes! The song!

28:43.887 --> 28:47.118
- ~ Give me some men who are...
- No! No!

28:47.207 --> 28:49.198
- No?
- No, come on.

28:53.167 --> 28:55.158
Mm-hm.

29:25.287 --> 29:27.278
- Mr Holland?
- You"re late.

29:27.887 --> 29:30.685
And you left your clarinet here
the other day.

29:31.167 --> 29:34.796
Yeah, um...
if you know anyone who wants it...

29:36.767 --> 29:41.318
I'm giving up the clarinet. I'm just
goofing everybody else up anyway.

29:41.887 --> 29:46.756
So, um... I just wanted to say thanks.
Thanks for trying.

29:49.807 --> 29:51.798
Is it any fun?

29:57.247 --> 29:59.238
I wanted it to be.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.083
You know what we"ve been doing wrong?

30:04.167 --> 30:06.761
We"ve been playing the notes on the page.

30:09.247 --> 30:11.442
Well, what else is there to play?

30:13.087 --> 30:15.999
there's a lot more to music
than notes on a page.

30:17.527 --> 30:19.518
(~ `Louie, Louie``` by the Kingsmen)

30:19.607 --> 30:21.598

30:22.607 --> 30:25.565
Now... they can't sing,

30:25.767 --> 30:29.077
and they have absolutely
no harmonic sense, and they"re...

30:29.207 --> 30:32.961
they"re playing the same three chords
over and over again.

30:33.047 --> 30:35.038
And I love it.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.080
- Do you?
- Yeah.

30:37.167 --> 30:39.203
Yeah!

30:39.287 --> 30:41.278
Why?

30:44.167 --> 30:46.635
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

30:47.287 --> 30:49.676
- Because It's fun?
- that's right.

30:49.767 --> 30:53.237
Because playing music
is supposed to be fun.

30:53.927 --> 30:56.077
It's about... heart.

30:56.727 --> 31:02.006
It's about feelings and... moving people
and something beautiful and being alive,

31:02.087 --> 31:04.965
and It's not about notes on a page!

31:05.047 --> 31:09.404
I could teach you notes on a page.
I can't teach you that other stuff.

31:10.607 --> 31:12.598
Do me a favour.

31:13.487 --> 31:16.559
Pick up your clarinet... and play with me.

31:17.127 --> 31:20.483
- OK.
- And this time... no music.

31:20.567 --> 31:23.286
- Oh, what...
- Because you already know it.

31:24.367 --> 31:26.961

and your heart.

Mr Holland, it has come to my attention

39:30.447 --> 39:33.678
that you are teaching
the students rock"n"roll.

39:34.487 --> 39:37.638
- Is this a problem?
- Is this a problem? Yes, I think so.

39:37.727 --> 39:41.515

and the students cannot learn,

39:41.607 --> 39:43.677
if there is no discipline.

39:43.767 --> 39:46.839
I'm sorry, what exactly
is your point, Gene?

39:46.927 --> 39:51.557
My point is rock"n"roll, by its very nature,
leads to a breakdown in discipline.

39:51.647 --> 39:54.320
Would you like me
to deny that rock"n"roll exists?

- How about the Kingston Trio, Gene?

40:08.527 --> 40:13.442
- How about "Sing Along With Mitch"?
- Just a minute, gentlemen!

40:13.527 --> 40:18.965
Mr Holland, I do not want to interfere
in the curriculum of any teacher.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.284
But next week I have a meeting
with the school board.

40:22.367 --> 40:28.397
There are people who believe rock'n'roll
is a message sent from the devil himself.

40:28.487 --> 40:32.036
Now when that issue comes up,
what can I tell them?

40:36.207 --> 40:38.482
Mrs Jacobs,

40:38.567 --> 40:42.116
you tell them that I am teaching music,

40:43.127 --> 40:47.837
and that I will use anything, from
Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rock"n"roll...

40:48.847 --> 40:53.523
if I think it"ll help me teach a student
to love music.

40:55.327 --> 40:57.443
that's...

40:57.527 --> 40:59.916
a reasonable answer, Mr Holland.

41:01.087 --> 41:03.237
I can tell them that.

41:04.607 --> 41:07.041
Was there somethin" else?

41:10.687 --> 41:12.996
Yes. Um...

41:13.087 --> 41:17.319
have you been to any of the football
games this season, Mr Holland?

41:18.407 --> 41:20.762
I can't say that I have, no.

41:21.447 --> 41:25.122
Well, Mrs Jacobs and I
feel that there's something missing.

41:25.527 --> 41:27.518
Touchdowns. (chuckles)

41:28.807 --> 41:30.798
I'm sorry.

41:33.247 --> 41:35.807
What do you know
about marching bands?

41:38.167 --> 41:39.395
Pardon me?

41:41.247 --> 41:43.238
Set! Hut!

41:44.007 --> 41:45.998
Get him! Get him down!

41:47.487 --> 41:49.876
that's the way!
that's the way to crash down!

41:49.967 --> 41:51.480
(Holland) Uh...

41:51.567 --> 41:53.523
drums and sousaphones.

41:53.607 --> 41:57.441
Come on, line up here -
sousaphones on either side, and...

41:58.607 --> 42:03.476
baritones and saxes here. Third line.

42:03.567 --> 42:05.364
Put your shirt-tail in!

42:05.447 --> 42:08.484
This isn't a dance.
It looks like a party dress! Get it in!

42:08.567 --> 42:12.242
Let"s do it a little quicker.
We don't wanna be here till It's dark.

42:12.327 --> 42:16.843
Now, we"re not even, and I"d like
to make some attempt to, um...

42:16.927 --> 42:19.885
Can you even up here?
Can you, like, even this...?

42:19.967 --> 42:22.800
Do you understand what I'm saying
when I say even up?

42:22.887 --> 42:24.878
Line up. There you go!

42:25.767 --> 42:29.680
All right, all right.
Take care of "even" some... next time.

42:29.767 --> 42:32.679
Get over here! What are you doing?

42:32.767 --> 42:34.803
- Sorry.
- Are you tryin" to kill me?

42:34.887 --> 42:37.082
Watch my hand, OK?

42:37.167 --> 42:41.126
One, two, three, march!

42:41.207 --> 42:47.396
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

42:47.487 --> 42:49.125
No! No! No!

42:49.207 --> 42:53.678
- Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
- Hey, John. Let "em take a knee.

42:53.767 --> 42:56.201
No, no, no. You"re clumping up.

42:56.287 --> 42:58.357
No, no, no. People, spread out.

42:58.447 --> 43:02.122
I want you to spread! Spread out! Spread.

43:02.207 --> 43:05.517
And turn. Turn around.
And keep marching!

43:05.727 --> 43:12.997
Keep marching. Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right. Left...

43:17.687 --> 43:21.316
- Stop! Take a knee.
- (laughter)

43:21.407 --> 43:24.001
All right, start runnin"! Hats on!

43:24.847 --> 43:27.805
And don't stop till you hear this whistle.

43:28.647 --> 43:31.241
Glenn. Glenn.

43:32.607 --> 43:35.724
Man! Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man!

43:37.087 --> 43:39.476
I take it you were never in the army.

43:41.327 --> 43:43.887
Now, that's a stupid question!

43:44.927 --> 43:47.885
I was. Man, I marched my keister off.

43:48.847 --> 43:50.838
Well, then help me out.

43:53.487 --> 43:55.478
OK.

43:56.487 --> 43:59.559
You see this kid up in the stands here?
that's Lou Russ.

43:59.647 --> 44:03.686
He was the greatest halfback ever. I had
to toss him off the team cos of his grades.

44:03.767 --> 44:05.644
I'm about to lose him for wrestling.

44:05.727 --> 44:10.039
What are we talking about? What do you
want me to do? Take his tests for him?

44:10.127 --> 44:11.719
No.

44:11.807 --> 44:13.957
But I bet if he played in your band,

44:14.047 --> 44:18.962
I could talk Jacobs into giving him an
academic credit. And then I'll help you.

44:19.047 --> 44:21.845
- What instrument does he play?
- He doesn't.

44:25.407 --> 44:27.398
He doesn't play anything.

44:29.167 --> 44:32.364
- What, are you kidding?
- No. He"ll fit right in.

44:34.167 --> 44:37.682
Glenn, listen.
You get him to play anything...

44:38.367 --> 44:40.358
and I'll get them to march.

44:43.847 --> 44:48.079
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Coach Meister, your marching buddy.

44:49.567 --> 44:52.161
You know anything at all
about music, Mr Russ?

44:52.247 --> 44:55.683
- No, sir, Coach.
- You don't have to say "sir".

44:55.767 --> 44:58.361
I'm not a coach,
so "Mr Holland" is just fine.

44:58.567 --> 45:00.637
I'm sorry, sir. I mean, Mr Holland.

45:00.727 --> 45:04.163
don't apologise -
you haven"t done anything yet. Um...

45:06.087 --> 45:08.601
You know how to read music?
Even a little?

45:10.687 --> 45:12.917
- No.
- No. No...

45:14.447 --> 45:17.883
Well, you do realise
that you"re gonna have to learn

45:17.967 --> 45:22.085
at least some of the fundamentals of
music before you can get into the band?

45:22.167 --> 45:26.843
Listen, Mr Holland. I work hard.
I know how to work hard.

45:26.927 --> 45:28.997
I'm just not a school type of person.

45:30.847 --> 45:32.838
OK.

45:33.247 --> 45:37.320
Well, which instrument
do you think you"d like to play?

45:37.727 --> 45:40.844
Well, I was kinda thinking...
How about electric guitar?

45:41.647 --> 45:45.117
Well, this is a marching band.
The extension cord would kill us.

45:45.207 --> 45:48.358
- How about the tuba?
- Tuba"s are for fat guys with pimples!

45:48.527 --> 45:51.997
Well, given the time constraints,
how do drums strike you?

45:53.167 --> 45:54.441
A drum!

46:08.087 --> 46:10.078
You"re ahead, Mr Russ!

46:16.967 --> 46:19.197
Get on the beat, Mr Russ.

46:23.607 --> 46:26.326
Whoa, whoa! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop! Stop.

46:26.407 --> 46:29.922
- What happened? Where did you go?
- I keep losin" my place.

46:30.487 --> 46:32.682
Well, why don't you find it?

46:33.007 --> 46:36.238
Enough of us here
already think that time is a magazine,

46:36.327 --> 46:40.445
and I don't want you confusing us
any further and, by the way, Mr Barr...

46:42.047 --> 46:45.039
it is not, as they say, considered couth

46:45.407 --> 46:49.116
to empty your spit valve
in the middle of the performance.

46:49.207 --> 46:52.404
Especially not on the foot
of the person sitting next to you.

46:52.487 --> 46:56.480
Let"s take it again from the top.
One, two. One, two.

47:05.407 --> 47:09.525

Whoa, whoa! Stop, stop. Stop!

47:11.687 --> 47:16.397
Boy, were you saved by the bell! Same
time, same place tomorrow. Thank you.

47:18.447 --> 47:23.726
- Mr Holland? I just want you to know...
- That you"re gonna work hard. I know.

47:23.807 --> 47:26.241
- Thanks, Mr Holland.
- You"re welcome.

47:28.247 --> 47:32.445
Tell me some stories about the chicks
you met when you were on the road.

47:32.527 --> 47:35.883
That was a different time.
I was a very different guy.

47:35.967 --> 47:37.958
Check.

47:39.247 --> 47:41.807
You must be keeping something
so good from me!

47:41.887 --> 47:44.765
- You avoid that question.
- I'm not avoiding anything!

47:44.847 --> 47:47.520
- I know you are.
- I lead a very different life now.

47:47.607 --> 47:51.600
I have a beautiful wife, a gorgeous child -
something you know nothing about.

47:51.687 --> 47:53.359
Check.

47:53.447 --> 47:56.723
- I wanna have kids someday.
- You ought to find a wife first.

47:56.807 --> 47:58.798
I don't want kids that badly.

48:00.087 --> 48:02.078
Checkmate.

48:03.447 --> 48:05.881
All right, all right, all right.

48:05.967 --> 48:08.879
Besides, the kids at school
are like my kids.

48:09.607 --> 48:14.044
I wanna smack "em sometimes, but
mostly I just wanna see "em do good.

48:14.767 --> 48:16.962
So, Lou Russ - he gonna make it?

48:19.127 --> 48:21.118
Is he gonna make it?

48:22.327 --> 48:25.842
- I don't think so.
- Glenn, come on. I need him!

48:26.407 --> 48:28.841
A kid doesn't wrestle,
It's not the end of the world.

48:28.927 --> 48:32.317
For him, it is! If he doesn't wrestle,
he doesn't have anything else.

48:32.407 --> 48:34.602
It's not about wrestling. I care about him.

48:34.687 --> 48:37.963
How can I keep a kid in the band
if he can't play an instrument?

48:38.047 --> 48:41.562
You teach him. Are you telling me
that you cannot teach

48:41.647 --> 48:44.525
a willing kid like Lou Russ
to bang a drum?

48:44.607 --> 48:46.086
- I tried!
- No, you teach him.

48:46.167 --> 48:49.159
- I tried, and I can't.
- Then you"re a lousy teacher.

48:50.287 --> 48:54.917
And I just can't see a chance like this
getting away from him if I can stop it!

48:59.887 --> 49:02.082
Look, I was a kid just like him,

49:02.447 --> 49:07.521
and if someone hadn"t given me a chance
to excel in the one thing I was good at,

49:07.607 --> 49:12.283
I never would have become the brilliant,
gum-chewing coach that I am.

49:19.207 --> 49:22.916
I was kept off the chess team,
and, well, It's ruined my life.

49:27.247 --> 49:28.475
Do it again.

54:52.047 --> 54:54.242
Was that fun, or what?

54:54.327 --> 54:56.557
there's something wrong with Cole.

54:57.167 --> 55:00.477
- What?
- I don't know. I've tried different things.

55:00.567 --> 55:05.561
Um... sneaking up behind him and
banging pots and screaming his name

55:05.647 --> 55:08.081
and stomping on the floor.

55:08.167 --> 55:11.682
He turned when I did that - big smile.
He thought I was playing a game.

55:11.767 --> 55:13.758
Iris.

55:15.127 --> 55:17.766
I don't think he can hear.

Cole? (claps)

55:49.447 --> 55:52.200
(doctor) Cole has
a 90 per cent hearing loss.

55:52.287 --> 55:55.723
With training, he will learn to use
what hearing he has left.

55:55.807 --> 55:59.720
Treat him as if he's normal.
Talk to him as if he can hear you.

55:59.807 --> 56:03.436
I notice Cole uses gestures
to help himself be understood.

56:03.527 --> 56:07.236
Let me caution you: don't use them back.

56:07.327 --> 56:11.002
Gestures won"t help him
find his place in a hearing world.

56:11.087 --> 56:16.002
When he's older, there are schools that
will help him, and you, to find his voice.

56:29.127 --> 56:31.118
He couldn"t hear.

Of all people.

56:34.967 --> 56:37.162
Not a thing.

56:37.727 --> 56:39.957
And because Beethoven couldn"t hear,

56:40.047 --> 56:47.362
the thought of him conducting, let alone
composing, was pathetic to most people.

56:47.447 --> 56:51.725
And so, to answer them, he composed
and conducted the 7th Symphony.

and the orchestra in his mind
was playing perfectly.

57:17.167 --> 57:22.287
And the orchestra in front of him...
trying desperately just to keep up.

57:27.287 --> 57:29.676
There is a story...

57:30.807 --> 57:34.004
that, in order to write his music,

57:34.087 --> 57:37.443
Beethoven literally
sawed the legs off his piano

57:37.527 --> 57:40.519
so that he could lay the body
flat on the ground.

57:41.887 --> 57:43.878
And then...

57:44.647 --> 57:49.846
he would lay down on the ground next to
the piano with his ear pressed to the floor.

57:51.807 --> 57:54.605
And he would pound the keys
with his fingers...

57:56.927 --> 58:02.445
in order to hear his music
through the vibrations of the floor.

58:04.447 --> 58:06.722
Mr Holland?

58:07.447 --> 58:09.039
Mr Holland?

58:12.647 --> 58:16.799
If he couldn"t hear, how would he
even know what the notes were?

58:17.647 --> 58:22.801
Like, if he never heard a C, how"d he
know that's what he wanted played?

58:29.687 --> 58:31.678
Well...

58:35.007 --> 58:36.998
Beethoven wasn't born deaf.

01:01:16.127 --> 01:01:17.606
A private school?

01:01:18.167 --> 01:01:21.603
She said It's the best, and It's way ahead
of any other school in the state.

01:01:21.687 --> 01:01:24.918
- It's probably expensive.
- Yeah, but if It's the best...

01:01:25.007 --> 01:01:28.795
I'm just worried about where
the money"s coming from, that's all.

01:01:28.887 --> 01:01:32.277
It's probably a great place, Iris,
but I worry about the money.

01:01:32.367 --> 01:01:35.484
What do you want, honey?
Show me what you want.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.876
You want a dessert? This?

01:01:38.727 --> 01:01:40.718
I don't know what you want.

01:01:46.247 --> 01:01:47.999
Dessert? No?

01:01:48.087 --> 01:01:52.080
- This? This? I don't know what you want!
- So they were signing, huh?

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:55.364
The school emphasises it,
and she said It's for parents, too.

01:01:55.447 --> 01:01:58.120
- What do you want?
- Dr Sorenson said that gestures...

01:01:58.207 --> 01:02:00.721
- It's more than gestures!
- .. gestures meant

01:02:00.807 --> 01:02:03.002
he"d never learn how to lip-read or talk!

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:05.681
He can barely talk now!
He can't say two words!

01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:08.156
- The guy is a specialist, Iris.
- Oh!

01:02:08.247 --> 01:02:12.445
He thinks that deaf people are retarded.
He is not retarded, he's...

01:02:12.527 --> 01:02:14.199
- Cole!
- (whines)

01:02:14.287 --> 01:02:18.075
- Give him what he wants!
- I don't know what he's trying to tell me.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:22.240
don't you get it? You go off to school
with your children who are normal.

01:02:22.327 --> 01:02:24.761
I can't talk to my son!

01:02:24.847 --> 01:02:27.236
I don't know what he wants
or what he thinks!

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:31.002
I can't tell him that I love him!
I can't tell him who I am!

01:02:31.087 --> 01:02:33.282
I want to talk to my son.

01:02:33.367 --> 01:02:36.916
I don't care what it costs. I don't care
what the stupid doctor says.

01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:38.998
I wanna talk to my son!

01:02:39.847 --> 01:02:42.077

01:02:42.167 --> 01:02:44.158

01:02:44.647 --> 01:02:46.638
Oh, Cole.

01:02:48.927 --> 01:02:53.205
OK, now we"ll talk about what is today.
Can you tell me what's today?

01:02:53.287 --> 01:02:56.438
Tuesday. Good! Can you spell it for me?

01:02:56.527 --> 01:03:03.046
T-U-E-S-D-A-Y.

01:03:03.127 --> 01:03:06.802
Wonderful! Now, can you
tell me what is tomorrow?

01:03:06.887 --> 01:03:10.084
(woman) We encourage talking
and signing at the same time.

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:13.318
As you can see,
today the class is learning

01:03:13.407 --> 01:03:16.240
the days of the week
and the months of the year.

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:21.236
Would you care to step out
for just a moment? Shall we?

01:03:21.327 --> 01:03:22.885
What was yesterday?

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:25.242
- Can we talk about tuition?
- Yes.

01:03:25.327 --> 01:03:27.636
Is there any chance
of government subsidy?

01:03:27.727 --> 01:03:31.276
- I'm afraid not.
- Well, we can handle it.

01:03:31.367 --> 01:03:35.519
So how long would it be
before he learns how to sign?

01:03:35.607 --> 01:03:37.643
Not as long as it"ll take the two of you.

01:03:37.727 --> 01:03:40.480
You see, children learn very quickly.

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:44.003
But adults, well, so much depends
on how much you put into it.

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:46.999
Mm-hm. And when would we begin?

01:03:47.087 --> 01:03:51.842
Our next intensive programme, the one
geared towards parents, starts in June.

01:03:51.927 --> 01:03:54.964
It's three months, three hours every day.

01:03:55.847 --> 01:04:00.125
The most important teacher
your child will ever have is you.

01:04:04.447 --> 01:04:07.644
So, who was Bach writing all this for?

01:04:10.727 --> 01:04:13.116
Mr Tidd! Care to join us?

01:04:13.207 --> 01:04:15.402
Uh, Lurch in The Addams Family?

01:04:15.487 --> 01:04:17.842
You"re the Lurch, you dipstick!

01:04:17.927 --> 01:04:21.158
- How about I shut your smart mouth?
- Anytime you wanna try.

01:04:21.247 --> 01:04:24.717
Tidd! Take one more step,
you"ll think you were born in detention.

01:04:24.807 --> 01:04:26.877
Get back to your seat.

01:04:26.967 --> 01:04:32.678

to deal with a pest is to ignore them.

01:04:34.807 --> 01:04:39.483
OK... don't forget

Stadler.

01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:47.806
- You stoned again, Stadler?
- I don't need to stay straight. I know this.

01:04:47.887 --> 01:04:50.242
I can give you all the names
and dates you want.

01:04:50.327 --> 01:04:54.036
- I know all the scales, counterpoint...
- So what?

01:04:54.127 --> 01:04:58.723
This class is Music Appreciation.
I don't see you appreciating anything.

01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:01.367
- This is such lame bullshit.
- Sit down!

01:05:03.527 --> 01:05:06.917
You are this close
from being suspended, pal.

01:05:14.567 --> 01:05:17.001
You think you are real smart, don't you?

01:05:18.367 --> 01:05:21.837
OK... prove it.

01:05:22.607 --> 01:05:25.075
I want a paper on my desk
by the end of term.

01:05:25.167 --> 01:05:28.603
I want it to be single-spaced.
I want it to be annotated.

01:05:28.687 --> 01:05:31.997
I want the name of this report to be
Music, the Language of Emotion.

01:05:32.087 --> 01:05:34.681
- You can't make me do that.
- Watch me!

01:05:36.127 --> 01:05:38.595
You don't do it, you flunk.

01:05:38.687 --> 01:05:40.678
This isn't fair, Mr Holland!

01:05:40.767 --> 01:05:44.442
- Life is not fair, pal.
- Mr Holland?

01:05:56.647 --> 01:05:58.638
Yeah.

01:06:00.047 --> 01:06:02.686
- Tell Mrs Jacobs I'll take care of it.
- OK.

01:06:05.487 --> 01:06:07.478
- Am I released yet?
- No.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:16.442
I want you to meet me here
Saturday morning at 10am.

01:06:16.527 --> 01:06:18.165
Why?

01:06:18.247 --> 01:06:20.238
Research.

01:06:23.407 --> 01:06:27.116
We are honoured and we are proud
that we have known him.

01:06:27.207 --> 01:06:29.562
And our lives are for ever changed.

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:39.435
Let us burn bright his spirit,
his courage, his love.

that's some kid I taught to bang a drum,
named Louis Russ.

01:07:17.247 --> 01:07:22.321
He made the state wrestling finals
three years running.

01:07:26.807 --> 01:07:31.961
He was never as smart as you are. He had
to work real hard... even to graduate.

01:07:35.087 --> 01:07:37.521
Maybe that's why
it meant so much to him.

for his long and faithful service
to his country.

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:46.962

- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

What a waste.

People, let"s get through this.

Please! If we could move on
to the next item of the agenda,

01:13:04.767 --> 01:13:08.282
- which is the senior-class play.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

After our critical success last year
with Romeo and Juliet...

01:13:13.087 --> 01:13:17.603
Mr Holland and I have come up with a
wonderful idea for this year"s production.

01:13:17.687 --> 01:13:20.440
We"re not doing a full production,
but a review.

01:13:20.527 --> 01:13:24.998
A George and Ira Gershwin review -
very few costumes, one set.

01:13:25.087 --> 01:13:26.122
(Holland) Cheaper...

01:13:26.207 --> 01:13:30.644
This will bother you, but we have to
consider cutting the senior-class play.

01:13:30.727 --> 01:13:34.766
Are you nuts? You know what?
Oddly enough, It's gonna bother me.

01:13:34.847 --> 01:13:38.886
People. People, please.
Let"s keep in mind why we are here.

01:13:38.967 --> 01:13:42.277
We"re looking for things
which keep money in the school coffers.

01:13:42.367 --> 01:13:45.564
- At the expense of what?
- I have a responsibility.

01:13:45.647 --> 01:13:49.117
To the Board of Education.
There just isn't the money to fund...

01:13:49.207 --> 01:13:52.040
- Why are we teaching any of this?
- Let"s move on.

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:55.244
- This kind of thing is important to me.
- Excuse me. Gene.

01:13:57.087 --> 01:13:58.918
Yes... Bill?

01:13:59.007 --> 01:14:01.919
I can guarantee that this year"s show
will make money.

01:14:02.127 --> 01:14:06.803
- I'm listening.
- My football players dance in the show.

01:14:06.887 --> 01:14:09.720
People will show up
just to see "em fall on their asses.

01:14:09.807 --> 01:14:12.879
- I don't want to turn it into a farce.
- It wouldn"t be a farce.

01:14:12.967 --> 01:14:15.527
They"ll be better than
the June Taylor Dancers.

01:14:15.607 --> 01:14:17.757
That"ll shock the hell out of everybody.

01:14:17.847 --> 01:14:20.884
Who"s going to teach
the football players how to dance?

01:14:22.207 --> 01:14:25.244
- Me.
- (laughter)

01:14:26.367 --> 01:14:29.404
- You?
- I minored in modern dance.

01:14:31.927 --> 01:14:34.839
He minored in modern dance, Gene.

01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:39.801
I did. The coach had us do it
so we"d be more graceful.

01:14:41.167 --> 01:14:43.158
Glenn, hold my leg. Come on.

01:14:51.647 --> 01:14:53.478
~ I've got rhythm

01:14:53.567 --> 01:14:55.478
~ I've got music

01:14:55.567 --> 01:14:57.000
~ I've got my gal

01:14:57.087 --> 01:14:59.362
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:14:59.687 --> 01:15:01.439
~ I've got daisies

01:15:01.527 --> 01:15:03.483
~ In green pastures

01:15:03.647 --> 01:15:04.966
~ I've got my gal

01:15:05.047 --> 01:15:07.436
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:15:11.487 --> 01:15:15.275
- ~ Old man trouble, I don't mind him
- Smile!

01:15:15.367 --> 01:15:18.564
~ You won"t find him round my door

01:15:19.287 --> 01:15:21.118
~ I got rhythm

01:15:21.207 --> 01:15:22.879
~ I got music

01:15:22.967 --> 01:15:24.195
~ I got my gal

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:26.357
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:28.964
(out of tune) ~ I got daisies

01:15:29.047 --> 01:15:31.003
~ In green pastures

01:15:31.087 --> 01:15:34.477
~ I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?

01:15:34.567 --> 01:15:37.206
(flat) ~ Old man trouble, I don't mind him

01:15:37.287 --> 01:15:39.517
~ You won"t find him round my door

01:15:40.127 --> 01:15:42.960
~ I got starlight, I got...

01:15:43.167 --> 01:15:45.123
(shrilly) ~ I got starlight

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.038
~ I got sweet dreams

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:50.557
(out of tune) ~ I got my gal
Who could ask for anything more?

01:15:50.727 --> 01:15:54.879
- ~ Who could ask for anything more?
- ~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:57.845
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:15:57.927 --> 01:15:58.916
Huh?

01:16:00.487 --> 01:16:02.682
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:09.402
- We still don't have an ingénue.
- We still have more people to see.

01:16:09.487 --> 01:16:11.637
Billy Faraday can pull off the Gershwin,

01:16:11.727 --> 01:16:15.276
but the only ingénue we seem
to have so far is Todd Markham.

01:16:15.367 --> 01:16:17.437
I really don't think that Todd Markham...

01:16:17.527 --> 01:16:19.165
(in tune) ~ I got rhythm

01:16:19.247 --> 01:16:20.999
~ I got music

01:16:21.207 --> 01:16:22.435
~ I got my man

01:16:22.527 --> 01:16:25.166
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.236
~ I got daisies...

01:16:26.327 --> 01:16:30.445
Maybe It's just me, but I think
she's better than Todd Markham.

01:16:30.527 --> 01:16:33.166
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:16:33.247 --> 01:16:37.160
~ Old man trouble, I don't mind him

01:16:37.247 --> 01:16:40.876
~ You won"t find him round my door

01:16:41.247 --> 01:16:45.126
~ I got starlight, I got sweet dreams

01:16:45.207 --> 01:16:46.526
~ I got my man

01:16:46.607 --> 01:16:48.802
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:16:48.927 --> 01:16:53.318
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:16:55.927 --> 01:17:01.524
- Very good, Miss...?
- Morgan. Rowena Morgan.

01:17:02.447 --> 01:17:04.358
Very good.

01:17:04.447 --> 01:17:07.484
You were very, very good.
Thank you... very much.

01:17:14.727 --> 01:17:16.922
Hey! How was the science fair?

01:17:21.047 --> 01:17:23.083
- You wanna go to the what?
- Stars.

01:17:23.167 --> 01:17:25.556
Cole discovered astronomy tonight.

01:17:27.807 --> 01:17:31.277
Whoa! Whoa, slow down.
Slow down, you"re goin" like a rocket!

01:17:31.487 --> 01:17:34.559
He wants to be an astronaut.

01:17:36.607 --> 01:17:38.598
Good.

01:17:41.207 --> 01:17:45.325
- Who put that stuff in his head?
- As a matter of fact, his teachers.

01:17:46.207 --> 01:17:48.596
I thought you were going to meet us.

01:17:49.127 --> 01:17:52.642
Well, I wanted to, but I had to get
these orchestrations finished.

01:17:52.727 --> 01:17:54.718
We"re gonna do a Gershwin review.

01:17:54.807 --> 01:17:56.877
It's always something, isn't it?

01:17:56.967 --> 01:17:59.686
If it isn't a school play, It's band practice,

01:17:59.767 --> 01:18:02.884
or grading papers,
or a student committee needs an advisor.

01:18:02.967 --> 01:18:06.198
- Missing it isn't the end of the world.
- Maybe you didn"t hear me.

01:18:06.287 --> 01:18:09.757
- I heard you.
- He wanted you to be there tonight!

01:18:10.287 --> 01:18:11.640
Oh, God!

01:18:11.727 --> 01:18:16.847
You know what's really amazing? No
matter what I do, no matter how hard I try,

01:18:16.927 --> 01:18:20.044
sooner or later, anything I try
turns out being wrong.

01:18:20.127 --> 01:18:22.880
Why is every child
more important than your child?

01:18:22.967 --> 01:18:25.527
- I'm a teacher, Iris.
- You are his father!

01:18:25.607 --> 01:18:27.598
I'm both!

01:18:28.167 --> 01:18:32.604
I do one thing, I let him down.
I do another thing, I let the school down.

01:18:32.687 --> 01:18:34.723
I can't be everything for everybody.

01:18:34.807 --> 01:18:37.367
- You have to make priorities.
- I have!

01:18:37.447 --> 01:18:41.281
he's my son, and I love him.
I do the best I goddamn can, OK?

01:18:41.367 --> 01:18:43.437
Well, your best isn't good enough.

01:18:43.527 --> 01:18:45.677
So go on, write your music!

01:18:48.447 --> 01:18:52.998
Write my music, huh? Write my music?!
When do I have time to write my music?

01:19:00.447 --> 01:19:05.396
~ Won"t you tell him please
to put on some speed

01:19:05.487 --> 01:19:08.160
~ Follow my lead?

01:19:08.247 --> 01:19:11.478
~ Oh, how I need

01:19:12.887 --> 01:19:23.957
~ Someone to watch over me

01:19:24.727 --> 01:19:28.003
- (ripple of applause)
- That was perfect, darling.

01:19:28.087 --> 01:19:30.806
- Mr Holland?
- It was good.

01:19:30.887 --> 01:19:33.321
- Can I talk to her for a second?
- Sure.

01:19:33.407 --> 01:19:35.557
Let"s all take a break for a minute.

01:19:36.847 --> 01:19:39.680
- I was trying to sing my best.
- It was fine.

01:19:39.767 --> 01:19:41.758
I just wanna ask you a question.

01:19:43.807 --> 01:19:47.038
What do you think
the girl"s really feeling here?

01:19:50.647 --> 01:19:53.036
- I don't know.
- You have to know.

01:19:53.687 --> 01:19:55.757
Or you can't sing it.

01:19:56.087 --> 01:19:59.159
This song is wistful, Miss Morgan.

01:20:00.007 --> 01:20:04.239
It's about a woman who is alone
in a very, very cold world,

01:20:04.327 --> 01:20:09.082
and all she wants more than anything
is to have someone hold her close.

01:20:09.927 --> 01:20:13.283
And to tell her that everything"s
gonna be all right.

01:20:13.487 --> 01:20:15.842
It's about...

01:20:15.927 --> 01:20:18.077
the need for love...

01:20:18.967 --> 01:20:21.242
in your gut.

01:20:22.127 --> 01:20:23.446
OK?

01:20:25.407 --> 01:20:27.398
We"ll try it again, from the top.

01:20:28.247 --> 01:20:30.477
This time I wanna do it in a lower key.

01:20:34.527 --> 01:20:36.518
(~ piano intro)

01:20:37.127 --> 01:20:39.402
~ there's a saying old

01:20:39.487 --> 01:20:42.365
~ Says that love is blind

01:20:43.367 --> 01:20:45.517
~ Still we"re often told

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:48.485
~ "Seek and ye shall find"

01:20:49.607 --> 01:20:53.998
~ So I"d like to seek a certain lad

01:20:54.887 --> 01:21:00.439
~ I've had in mind

01:21:20.727 --> 01:21:24.322
- Hi, Mr Holland.
- Hey, Miss Morgan.

01:21:24.407 --> 01:21:26.602
What are you working on?

01:21:26.687 --> 01:21:28.723
Nothing important.

01:21:28.807 --> 01:21:33.198
It's just... sometimes It's easier
to work here than at home.

01:21:33.287 --> 01:21:36.199
- Would you mind if I joined you?
- No. Not at all.

01:21:37.407 --> 01:21:40.240
Want some coffee? Or tea?

01:21:40.327 --> 01:21:42.557
- Anything under a buck.
- (giggles)

01:21:44.527 --> 01:21:46.757
I always remembered that
about your class -

01:21:46.847 --> 01:21:49.759
you had this very highly developed
sense of humour.

01:21:49.847 --> 01:21:51.360
Thank you.

01:21:51.447 --> 01:21:54.325
I loved your class. The way you taught.

01:21:56.287 --> 01:21:58.517
You love music,
and you made the kids love it.

01:21:58.607 --> 01:22:02.725
- I always wanted to tell you that.
- Well... I'm glad you did.

01:22:04.727 --> 01:22:08.845
So, you"re a senior now. Got any ideas
about where you"re gonna go to college?

01:22:08.927 --> 01:22:14.160
No. My mom and dad have a little
restaurant downtown - my dad"s dream.

01:22:14.247 --> 01:22:16.522
He wants me to stay and help him with it.

01:22:16.927 --> 01:22:19.236
Really?

01:22:19.327 --> 01:22:23.286
- What do you wanna do?
- What do you mean?

01:22:23.607 --> 01:22:25.598
Well, I mean...

01:22:26.327 --> 01:22:28.557
if you had one wish, you know,

01:22:28.647 --> 01:22:33.163
if you could do whatever it is that you
really wanted to do, what would it be?

01:22:37.087 --> 01:22:38.918
Sing.

01:22:39.007 --> 01:22:43.285
I think I"d rather sing than do anything.
I dream about going to New York

01:22:43.367 --> 01:22:47.360
and being on the stage
in front of thousands of people.

01:22:47.447 --> 01:22:49.438
that's what I"d wish for.

01:22:52.887 --> 01:22:58.086
Maybe I shouldn"t tell you this,
Miss Morgan, but you have a great talent.

01:22:58.927 --> 01:23:02.078
And if you have the passion,
if you have the hunger...

01:23:02.767 --> 01:23:05.759
then you ought to go to New York
and do what you wanna do,

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:08.236
no matter what anyone tells you.

01:23:08.447 --> 01:23:10.642
(waitress) Can I get you anything?

01:23:10.727 --> 01:23:12.843
No.

01:23:12.927 --> 01:23:14.918
I should get going.

01:23:18.847 --> 01:23:22.283
- See you Monday, Mr Holland.
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

01:23:29.807 --> 01:23:31.798
(~ melancholy piece)

01:23:46.527 --> 01:23:48.404
- (discordant note)
- Cole.

01:23:49.287 --> 01:23:52.165
Cole, take this stuff outside. It stinks.

01:23:53.807 --> 01:23:56.367
Go open the window for him.

01:23:56.447 --> 01:23:58.756
Hey! don't bust my butt.

01:24:11.087 --> 01:24:13.078
No, no, no! No, no!

01:24:13.967 --> 01:24:16.845
- I don't believe it!
- He didn"t do it on purpose.

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:19.885
Are you kidding me? Of course he did!

01:24:21.127 --> 01:24:23.118
Cole, help clean up.

01:24:34.447 --> 01:24:36.483
Careful.

01:24:36.567 --> 01:24:38.603
Wait. Just wait, wait, wait.

01:24:38.687 --> 01:24:40.678
I'll do it myself.

01:24:43.807 --> 01:24:45.923
- Help me out here.
- he's trying to help.

01:24:46.007 --> 01:24:48.840
he's making a bigger mess
than he already has!

01:24:49.767 --> 01:24:52.600
This is off limits, Cole.
Do you understand?

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:55.440
- don't touch!
- that's "don't sit. "

01:25:03.047 --> 01:25:06.926
~ We may never, never meet again

01:25:07.007 --> 01:25:11.000
- ~ On the bumpy road to love
- don't push.

01:25:11.287 --> 01:25:18.125
~ Still, I'll always, always
keep the memory of

01:25:18.207 --> 01:25:22.086
~ The way you hold your knife

01:25:22.167 --> 01:25:25.159
~ The way we danced till three

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:29.523
~ The way you changed my life

01:25:30.687 --> 01:25:32.678
Where did you go?!

01:25:36.047 --> 01:25:38.277
I think we ought to call it quits.

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:41.086
Could we work on
"Someone to Watch Over Me"?

01:25:41.167 --> 01:25:44.204
- I've been working on it.
- It's pretty late.

01:25:45.087 --> 01:25:47.157
Next time, then.

01:25:59.407 --> 01:26:01.398
what's this?

01:26:03.207 --> 01:26:06.119
Oh, that's what I was working on
the other night.

01:26:06.207 --> 01:26:08.277
You wrote this?

01:26:08.367 --> 01:26:11.643
Well, I... I pick at it once in a while.

01:26:15.407 --> 01:26:17.637
Would you play this for me?

01:26:19.287 --> 01:26:21.039
Please.

01:26:37.167 --> 01:26:39.158
(~ melancholy piece)

01:26:44.007 --> 01:26:47.238
~ La-da, da-da

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:53.482
~ Da, da-da-da-da, da-da

01:26:55.527 --> 01:27:00.078
~ Da-da, da, da-da, da-da-da

01:27:01.527 --> 01:27:08.126
~ Da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

01:27:08.687 --> 01:27:11.997
~ Da-da

01:27:12.087 --> 01:27:14.078
(music ends)

01:27:16.327 --> 01:27:18.761
It's wonderful.

01:27:19.207 --> 01:27:21.357
Is there more?

01:27:21.447 --> 01:27:23.438
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:24.007 --> 01:27:26.362
- It's just not finished.
- (door opens)

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:29.358
(man) Ro, are you done yet?

01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:33.278
Are we?

01:27:38.407 --> 01:27:40.398
Good night, Rowena.

01:28:21.687 --> 01:28:23.837
Who"s Rowena?

01:28:23.927 --> 01:28:25.918
- Huh?
- Who"s Rowena?

01:28:26.807 --> 01:28:28.718
Uh...

01:28:28.807 --> 01:28:32.038
A legend. A heroine
from Norse mythology.

01:28:32.127 --> 01:28:35.039
I got a book about it
somewhere around here.

01:28:35.127 --> 01:28:40.406
I wondered what you thought would be a
good night for Cole and I to see the show.

01:28:40.487 --> 01:28:43.877
- Opening night.
- Yeah! Uh, no. Um...

01:28:43.967 --> 01:28:46.356
I've got a meeting with Cole"s teachers.

01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:48.438
Saturday, then.

01:28:49.407 --> 01:28:51.238
Yes.

01:28:51.327 --> 01:28:53.318
Great.

01:29:07.167 --> 01:29:09.158
(applause)

(~ `I Got Rhythm```)

~ I got music

~ I got my gal

01:29:18.847 --> 01:29:20.997
~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:29:21.487 --> 01:29:23.443
~ I got daisies

01:29:23.527 --> 01:29:25.518

~ I got my gal

~ Who could ask for anything more?

01:29:29.647 --> 01:29:33.276
~ Old man trouble, I don't mind him

01:29:33.687 --> 01:29:37.202
~ You won"t find him round my door

~ Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?

01:29:48.607 --> 01:29:55.843
~ Still, I'll always, always
keep the memory of

01:29:55.927 --> 01:30:00.239
~ The way you hold your knife

01:30:00.527 --> 01:30:04.645
(Billy) ~ The way we danced till three

01:30:04.887 --> 01:30:08.960
~ The way you changed my life

01:30:09.047 --> 01:30:13.279
~ No, no, they can't
take that away from me

01:30:13.367 --> 01:30:21.047
~ No, they can't take that away from me

~ Who could ask

01:30:33.847 --> 01:30:37.522
~ For anything

01:30:37.607 --> 01:30:43.364
~ Anything more?

01:31:12.207 --> 01:31:14.198
(Holland) Good night, Sarah.

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.878
Mr Holland?

01:31:36.447 --> 01:31:38.438
How was I? The truth.

01:31:40.247 --> 01:31:42.363
You were great.

01:31:42.447 --> 01:31:44.677
- I owe it all to you.
- No...

01:31:46.247 --> 01:31:48.442
No.

01:31:48.527 --> 01:31:50.518
I just accompanied you.

01:31:52.207 --> 01:31:56.962
Mr Holland, I'm doing what you said. I'm
going to New York. I'm gonna be a singer.

01:32:00.407 --> 01:32:03.558
Someday we"re all gonna say
that we knew you when...

01:32:03.647 --> 01:32:05.717
No, you don't understand.

01:32:05.807 --> 01:32:08.924
- I'm going tomorrow.
- What?

01:32:09.007 --> 01:32:11.919
there's a party at Miss Olmstead"s
after we close the play.

01:32:12.007 --> 01:32:15.477
I'll be there to say goodbye to my friends.
They don't know, but...

01:32:15.567 --> 01:32:18.001
the bus leaves
from downtown at midnight.

01:32:18.087 --> 01:32:19.520
Rowena...

01:32:19.607 --> 01:32:21.723
Rowena...

01:32:21.807 --> 01:32:25.322
When I said that you should go
to New York, I didn"t mean right away.

01:32:25.407 --> 01:32:28.365
- You have so much time.
- If I wait, I'll never do it.

01:32:28.447 --> 01:32:33.157
I'll end up waiting tables or working
in some store. It has to be now.

01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:35.681
You could come with me.

01:32:35.767 --> 01:32:38.076
I know you think I'm just a kid.

01:32:39.047 --> 01:32:41.607
- I know you"re married with a son.
- Rowena...

01:32:41.687 --> 01:32:43.882
I know.

01:32:43.967 --> 01:32:47.243
don't you see?
You can be writing great music.

01:32:52.287 --> 01:32:55.677
The bus stops at King"s drugstore...
tomorrow night.

01:33:13.927 --> 01:33:18.876
(Rowena) ~ Theres a saying old
says that love is blind

01:33:19.367 --> 01:33:24.521
~ Still were often told
```Seek and ye shall find```

01:33:25.007 --> 01:33:36.077
~ So I'm going to seek a certain lad
I`ve had in mind

01:33:36.167 --> 01:33:40.922
~ Looking everywhere,
havent found him yet

01:33:41.847 --> 01:33:47.080
~ Hes the big affair I cannot forget

01:33:47.687 --> 01:33:56.197
~ Only man I ever think of with regret

01:33:58.127 --> 01:34:05.966
~ I'd like to add his initial
to my monogram

01:34:07.927 --> 01:34:20.442
~ Tell me, where is the shepherd
for this lost lamb?

01:34:22.207 --> 01:34:28.043
~ there's a somebody I'm longing to see

01:34:28.887 --> 01:34:32.118
~ I hope that he

01:34:32.287 --> 01:34:36.360
~ Turns out to be

01:34:37.047 --> 01:34:49.005
~ Someone who'll watch over me

01:34:52.247 --> 01:34:57.765
~ I'm a little lamb who"s lost in the wood

01:34:58.367 --> 01:35:01.962
~ I know I could

01:35:02.127 --> 01:35:06.405
~ Always be good

01:35:06.887 --> 01:35:17.525
~ To one who'll watch over me

01:35:18.007 --> 01:35:23.320
~ Although he may not be the man

01:35:23.407 --> 01:35:27.480
~ Some girls think of as handsome

01:35:27.567 --> 01:35:35.963
~ To my heart he carries the key

01:35:38.287 --> 01:35:44.317
~ Won't you tell him, please,
to put on some speed

01:35:44.727 --> 01:35:48.163
~ Follow my lead?

01:35:48.647 --> 01:35:53.038
~ Oh, how I need

01:35:53.127 --> 01:36:07.326
~ Someone to watch over me

01:36:24.367 --> 01:36:28.599
Listen, some of the kids are having
a party. I should make an appearance.

01:36:29.047 --> 01:36:31.038
Do you want to come?

01:36:31.367 --> 01:36:32.686
Um...

01:36:32.767 --> 01:36:34.758
I should get Cole home.

01:36:35.967 --> 01:36:39.118
OK. Well, I'm not gonna be late. All right?

01:36:40.087 --> 01:36:42.078
OK.

01:37:16.047 --> 01:37:17.878
You pack light.

01:37:38.327 --> 01:37:40.318
You got a place to stay?

01:37:41.287 --> 01:37:43.278
YWCA.

01:37:49.927 --> 01:37:54.921
that's the name of a guy I used to play
in a band with. I've already called him.

01:37:55.807 --> 01:37:58.196
He and his wife are expecting you.

01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:06.476
This isn't the way I imagined it.

01:38:09.447 --> 01:38:11.563
But It's the best way.

01:39:12.247 --> 01:39:14.522
Goodbye, Rowena.

01:40:40.207 --> 01:40:42.198
I love you.

01:40:47.127 --> 01:40:49.118
I know.

01:41:02.367 --> 01:41:04.358
(male TVannouncer)
John Lennon is dead.

01:41:04.447 --> 01:41:09.043
(female announcer) New York City.
Residents say a man in his late 30s...

01:41:10.767 --> 01:41:15.761
(female announcer) The guiding spirit
of the Beatles is dead at the age of 40.

01:41:16.287 --> 01:41:19.643
(male radio announcer) The mood
was silence and reverence.

01:41:19.727 --> 01:41:23.606
But as the crowd sang the Beatles songs,
the songs of John Lennon,

01:41:23.687 --> 01:41:26.201
they became happier, vibrant,
more spirited.

01:41:26.287 --> 01:41:30.644
That was the purpose
of John Lennons music, and his life.

01:41:30.727 --> 01:41:32.524
This is Jim Collins reporting.

01:42:01.207 --> 01:42:03.323
What happened to your eye?

01:42:05.527 --> 01:42:07.518
Sorry?

01:42:13.487 --> 01:42:15.205
- Later.
- (clunks spanner)

01:42:19.887 --> 01:42:22.401
In a second!

01:42:28.687 --> 01:42:32.282
Someone was... was killed.

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:36.564
No, no. Cole. that's not funny.

01:42:47.807 --> 01:42:49.798
John...

01:42:52.327 --> 01:42:53.965
Lennon.

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:56.158
The musician.

01:42:58.807 --> 01:43:00.798
You wouldn"t understand.

01:43:13.127 --> 01:43:15.163
Are you OK? It's so sad.

01:43:21.927 --> 01:43:23.918
Cole, what is it?!

01:43:25.367 --> 01:43:28.962
- He wants to what?
- He wants to tell you something.

01:43:29.047 --> 01:43:32.084
- Couldn"t we do this another time?
- Now!

01:43:35.087 --> 01:43:39.524
(Iris) "You assume Lennon's death means
nothing to me. Do you think I'm stupid?"

01:43:40.047 --> 01:43:42.515
- "I know who John Lennon is. "
- I never said...

01:43:43.007 --> 01:43:45.362
"I can't read your lips
if you don't look at me. "

01:43:45.447 --> 01:43:48.041
I never said that you were stupid.

01:43:48.927 --> 01:43:52.556
"You must think so if you think
I don't know who the Beatles are,

01:43:52.647 --> 01:43:54.922
or any music at all. "

01:43:55.007 --> 01:43:58.636
"You think I don't care about
what it is that you do, or what you love?"

01:43:58.727 --> 01:44:01.116
"You"re my father. "

01:44:01.207 --> 01:44:05.120
"I know what music is. You could
help me to know it better, but... no. "

01:44:09.887 --> 01:44:13.482
"You care more about teaching
other people than you do about me. "

01:44:21.767 --> 01:44:23.758
Iris.

01:44:24.447 --> 01:44:26.438
(clears throat)

01:44:27.687 --> 01:44:29.803
What does this mean?

01:44:29.887 --> 01:44:31.878
That means "asshole".

01:44:53.087 --> 01:44:55.078
Come to bed.

01:44:55.167 --> 01:44:57.158
It's really late.

01:44:58.687 --> 01:45:00.678
I was only tryin" to...

01:45:02.447 --> 01:45:04.438
protect him.

01:45:05.207 --> 01:45:07.596
I just didn"t wanna see him hurt...

01:45:08.727 --> 01:45:10.718
or disappointed.

01:45:11.567 --> 01:45:13.558
Hm.

01:45:21.447 --> 01:45:23.438
(engine revs)

01:45:39.647 --> 01:45:43.356
The second would be,
if there are songs with words,

01:45:43.447 --> 01:45:47.565
you will need an interpreter, someone
to sign the words along with the music.

01:45:47.647 --> 01:45:49.956
- We can do two kinds of music.
- Right.

01:45:50.047 --> 01:45:53.005
The first kind would be
the pure music without words.

01:45:53.087 --> 01:45:54.361
The music.

01:45:54.447 --> 01:45:57.757
The pure music without words
that they could experience

01:45:57.847 --> 01:46:01.396
through putting themselves
closer to the language.

01:46:01.487 --> 01:46:03.284
Maybe lights flashing.

01:46:03.407 --> 01:46:05.398
(~ dramatic orchestral music)

01:47:14.847 --> 01:47:16.997
Did you like that?

01:47:17.087 --> 01:47:18.486
OK.

01:47:20.127 --> 01:47:22.197
OK.

01:47:22.287 --> 01:47:26.644
For our final selection tonight, we are
going to do a song by John Lennon.

01:47:26.727 --> 01:47:30.197
Now, to those of you
in our audience who cannot hear,

01:47:31.247 --> 01:47:36.605
you will be grateful for your hearing
difficulties because I am going to sing.

01:47:37.687 --> 01:47:41.441
And to those of you
who have no hearing problems,

01:47:42.527 --> 01:47:44.916
- my profound apologies.
- (laughter)

01:47:48.207 --> 01:47:50.198
Um...

01:47:52.887 --> 01:47:54.878
On a personal note...

01:47:58.287 --> 01:48:03.839
I would like to dedicate this song
to my son...

01:48:05.047 --> 01:48:07.038
Cole.

01:48:16.687 --> 01:48:18.564
(~ piano intro)

01:48:18.647 --> 01:48:21.036
~ Close your eyes

01:48:22.567 --> 01:48:24.797
~ Have no fear

01:48:26.207 --> 01:48:28.163
~ The monster"s gone

01:48:28.247 --> 01:48:29.919
~ he's on the run

01:48:30.007 --> 01:48:32.601
~ And your daddy"s here

01:48:34.287 --> 01:48:37.324
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

01:48:37.407 --> 01:48:40.558
~ Beautiful boy

01:48:41.327 --> 01:48:44.239
~ Before you go to sleep

01:48:45.367 --> 01:48:47.927
~ Say a little prayer

01:48:49.767 --> 01:48:52.998
~ Every day, in every way

01:48:53.087 --> 01:48:55.885
~ It's getting better and better

~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

01:49:01.007 --> 01:49:03.680
~ Beautiful boy

01:49:06.487 --> 01:49:09.081
~ Over the ocean

01:49:10.407 --> 01:49:13.638
~ Sailing away

01:49:13.727 --> 01:49:15.718
~ I can hardly wait

01:49:17.487 --> 01:49:19.955
~ To see you come of age

01:49:21.567 --> 01:49:26.436
~ But I guess we"ll both
just have to be patient

01:49:28.247 --> 01:49:31.239
~ Cos It's a long way to go

01:49:33.047 --> 01:49:35.163
~ A hard road to hoe

01:49:36.007 --> 01:49:39.204
~ Yes, It's a long way to go

01:49:39.727 --> 01:49:42.605
~ But in the meantime

01:49:43.887 --> 01:49:46.560
~ Before you cross the street

01:49:48.047 --> 01:49:50.800
~ Please take my hand

Hey, Joan. He wants to see me?

- he's with someone.
- Oh. Well, I'll come back later.

01:52:27.247 --> 01:52:29.283
Mr Holland...

01:52:29.367 --> 01:52:31.358
you"d better wait.

01:52:47.607 --> 01:52:50.440
Mr Holland... would you come in, please?

01:53:00.247 --> 01:53:02.920
- what's wrong with Sarah, Gene?
- Please, sit down.

01:53:03.007 --> 01:53:04.998
I"d rather stand, thanks.

01:53:06.127 --> 01:53:08.561
Why is Sarah crying, Gene?

01:53:08.647 --> 01:53:11.605
All right, I'll come right to the point.

01:53:11.687 --> 01:53:15.646
You know how acrimonious
the budget meeting was last Tuesday.

01:53:17.127 --> 01:53:19.402
Be that as it may,

01:53:19.487 --> 01:53:24.436
each school in the district has been asked
to reduce costs by ten per cent -

01:53:24.527 --> 01:53:26.643
by September.

01:53:26.727 --> 01:53:28.843
This is what I've decided.

01:53:40.287 --> 01:53:42.357
The entire music programme.

01:53:42.567 --> 01:53:45.035
And art. And drama.

01:53:45.127 --> 01:53:47.357
Well, congratulations, Gene.

01:53:48.207 --> 01:53:53.156
You"ve wanted to get rid of me for 30
years. They finally gave you an excuse.

01:53:53.687 --> 01:53:57.362
I'm not as popular as you.
I'm not anybody"s favourite anything.

01:53:57.447 --> 01:54:02.362
- that's because you"re the enemy, Gene.
- I care about these kids as much as you.

01:54:02.607 --> 01:54:07.283
If I'm forced to choose between Mozart
and reading and writing and long division,

01:54:07.367 --> 01:54:09.597
I choose long division.

01:54:12.607 --> 01:54:16.520
Well, I guess you can cut the arts
as much as you want, Gene.

01:54:16.607 --> 01:54:21.123
Sooner or later these kids aren"t gonna
have anything to read or write about.

01:54:23.687 --> 01:54:25.837
Mr Holland?

01:54:27.367 --> 01:54:29.722
If there's anything I can do...

01:54:29.807 --> 01:54:32.082
A recommendation?

01:54:32.167 --> 01:54:34.203
I'm 60 years old, Gene.

01:54:34.287 --> 01:54:38.075
What are you gonna do, write me
a recommendation for the morgue?

01:54:42.527 --> 01:54:45.758
- Jacobs would have fought this.
- She would have lost.

01:54:45.847 --> 01:54:50.159
Yes, she would have lost, but she
would have fought this, and so will I!

01:54:52.927 --> 01:54:57.796
No, no, do not misunderstand me.
I am not talking about my job.

01:54:57.887 --> 01:55:02.119
I am talking about the education
that students once got at Kennedy High

01:55:02.207 --> 01:55:05.802
versus the education that
you are willing to give these kids today.

01:55:05.887 --> 01:55:09.197
We have been going
over and over this, Mr Holland.

01:55:09.287 --> 01:55:12.040
- We"ve done all we can.
- Then do it again.

01:55:12.927 --> 01:55:16.556
that's what I said when you were
my student, Michael. It served you well.

01:55:16.647 --> 01:55:19.719
- That was a different time, Mr Holland.
- I don't think so.

01:55:19.807 --> 01:55:22.480
- I think that more was expected of us.
- 15 seconds.

01:55:22.567 --> 01:55:25.240
The big difference
is how little you people care.

01:55:25.327 --> 01:55:28.922
- And how lazy you"ve become.
- I resent your tone, Mr Holland.

01:55:29.007 --> 01:55:32.602
I don't think you have any appreciation
for our financial problems.

01:55:32.687 --> 01:55:34.564
Come on, Michael!

01:55:34.647 --> 01:55:39.357
The big problem here is that you are
willing to create a generation of children

01:55:39.447 --> 01:55:42.598
who will not have the ability
to think, create, listen...

01:55:42.687 --> 01:55:43.756
Time, Mr Holland.

01:55:43.847 --> 01:55:47.806
(Michael) Mr Holland, as I've said,
we"ve done the best that we can.

01:55:47.887 --> 01:55:50.447
Your best is not good enough!

01:55:59.367 --> 01:56:01.801
"A very flattering offer
has been made to me

01:56:01.887 --> 01:56:06.961
to teach at a university for the deaf
in Washington DC"!

01:56:08.527 --> 01:56:11.439
"I'm not sure that I'm going to take it

01:56:11.527 --> 01:56:16.123
because I'm fond of the students
in the school that I'm at now. "

01:56:16.967 --> 01:56:19.037
"It's something to think about. "

01:56:19.767 --> 01:56:23.362
"No girlfriends yet.
At least, not serious ones. "

01:56:23.807 --> 01:56:28.517
"And tell Dad that I'm never
going to give his car back. "

01:56:29.647 --> 01:56:31.956
"Love always, Cole. "

01:57:25.767 --> 01:57:27.758
(Meister) Hey.

01:57:29.167 --> 01:57:31.158
Hey.

01:57:31.967 --> 01:57:34.037
What are you doin" here?

01:57:34.127 --> 01:57:38.245
I had some jockstraps in the rinse cycle
down in the locker room(!)

01:57:40.527 --> 01:57:42.802
I came to see if you needed any help.

01:57:42.887 --> 01:57:44.684
Nope.

01:57:44.767 --> 01:57:46.758
No, no, no.

01:57:47.447 --> 01:57:50.245
So, you decided
what you"re gonna do yet?

01:57:50.327 --> 01:57:52.318
Too old to start a rock band.

01:57:54.007 --> 01:57:58.205
Probably hang out a shingle
and teach a few piano lessons.

01:57:59.847 --> 01:58:03.203
- I"d love to retire...
- I'm not retiring, Bill.

01:58:03.287 --> 01:58:05.278
I'm getting dumped.

01:58:07.007 --> 01:58:10.283
And I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

01:58:10.367 --> 01:58:13.564
The day they cut the football budget
in this state, well, now,

01:58:13.647 --> 01:58:17.196
that will be the end
of Western civilisation as we know it.

01:58:20.607 --> 01:58:22.598
I'll tell you the truth.

01:58:24.967 --> 01:58:27.242
I'm scared to death.

01:58:27.327 --> 01:58:30.717
- They"re gonna miss you around here.
- You really think so?

01:58:30.807 --> 01:58:34.402
- What, do you doubt it?
- Well, as a matter of fact, yeah.

01:58:35.407 --> 01:58:40.197
It's almost funny - I got dragged into
this gig kicking and screaming,

01:58:40.287 --> 01:58:43.040
and now It's the only thing
I wanna do, and...

01:58:46.327 --> 01:58:48.318
You work your whole life...

01:58:50.527 --> 01:58:55.123
you work for 30 years because you think
that what you do makes a difference.

01:58:56.047 --> 01:58:58.038
You think it matters to people.

01:58:59.207 --> 01:59:02.324
And then you wake up one morning
and you find out, well, no,

01:59:02.407 --> 01:59:05.683
you"ve made a little error there.

01:59:05.767 --> 01:59:10.045
You are... expendable.

01:59:14.687 --> 01:59:17.679
Oh, God. (chuckles)

01:59:19.047 --> 01:59:21.038
Oh, I should be laughing.

01:59:24.727 --> 01:59:27.241
You"re sure you don't need any help, huh?

01:59:29.567 --> 01:59:31.558
All right.

01:59:43.047 --> 01:59:45.038
(car horn beeps repeatedly)

01:59:57.767 --> 01:59:59.519
Dad!

02:00:00.687 --> 02:00:03.076
What are you doing here?!

02:00:03.167 --> 02:00:05.840
School is out for me too.

02:00:05.927 --> 02:00:08.361
The old car... it looks pretty good.

02:00:08.967 --> 02:00:12.004
It's a classic. You can't have it back!

02:00:20.007 --> 02:00:23.682
No! No... you don't have to do this.

02:00:23.767 --> 02:00:26.565
I don't want an old fart like you
to strain yourself.

02:00:26.647 --> 02:00:28.717
OK, OK... asshole.

02:00:32.247 --> 02:00:34.283
that's enough, you two.

02:00:34.367 --> 02:00:36.358
Let"s go out to the car.

02:01:10.287 --> 02:01:12.278
(~ piano)

02:01:14.487 --> 02:01:16.478
Now, what is that?

02:01:16.567 --> 02:01:18.558
Um... I don't know.

02:01:19.127 --> 02:01:23.564
- You can't hear what's going on in there?
- Oh, yeah. I... I hear it, but...

02:01:23.647 --> 02:01:26.286
there's something going on in there.

02:01:26.367 --> 02:01:31.395
- It could be a summer programme.
- They don't start for another two weeks.

02:01:31.807 --> 02:01:33.957
(~ students sing `Louie, Louie```)

02:02:27.167 --> 02:02:30.682
- Mr Stadler?
- I wouldn"t have missed it, Mr Holland.

02:02:54.887 --> 02:02:56.878
Hi!

02:03:15.047 --> 02:03:17.038
Uh... I'll sign myself.

02:03:22.167 --> 02:03:24.397
Uh, hello. Um... (clears throat)

02:03:25.447 --> 02:03:29.156
Our master of ceremonies
seems to be a little late,

02:03:29.647 --> 02:03:32.400
so I guess It's up to me to begin.

02:03:33.247 --> 02:03:36.796
When word first got out
that the music programme was cut,

02:03:36.887 --> 02:03:40.038
and about the retirement of my husband,

02:03:40.927 --> 02:03:46.206
well, I've never seen such a response
from the community.

02:03:47.207 --> 02:03:50.005
Oh! Looks like my watch is fast.

02:03:50.087 --> 02:03:53.875
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
may I present our governor

02:03:53.967 --> 02:03:56.606
and Kennedy High School alumnus,

02:03:56.687 --> 02:03:59.997
the most honourable Gertrude Lang.

02:04:03.767 --> 02:04:05.758
Gertrude.

02:04:06.647 --> 02:04:08.922
It's been a long time.

02:04:18.607 --> 02:04:21.599
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh... thank you.

02:04:31.447 --> 02:04:33.961
My... my apologies for my tardiness.

02:04:34.047 --> 02:04:38.837
Principal Wolters, I"d like you to know,
yes, I brought a note from my mother!

02:04:43.167 --> 02:04:47.365
Mr Holland had
a profound influence on my life -

02:04:47.447 --> 02:04:49.483
on a lot of lives I know.

02:04:50.007 --> 02:04:55.639
And yet I get the feeling that he considers
a great part of his own life misspent.

02:04:57.327 --> 02:05:00.285
Rumour had it he was always
working on his symphony,

02:05:00.367 --> 02:05:03.120
and this was gonna
make him famous, rich -

02:05:03.207 --> 02:05:05.437
probably both.

02:05:05.527 --> 02:05:10.555
But Mr Holland isn't rich,
and... he isn't famous.

02:05:10.647 --> 02:05:13.161
At least, not outside of our little town.

02:05:13.807 --> 02:05:17.482
So it might be easy for him
to think himself a failure.

02:05:18.967 --> 02:05:20.958
And he would be wrong.

02:05:21.927 --> 02:05:26.045
Because I think he's achieved a success
far beyond riches and fame.

02:05:27.887 --> 02:05:29.923
Look around you.

02:05:30.007 --> 02:05:33.636
There is not a life in this room
that you have not touched.

02:05:34.527 --> 02:05:38.918
(voice quivers) And... each one of us
is a better person because of you.

02:05:39.847 --> 02:05:42.884
We are your symphony, Mr Holland.

02:05:42.967 --> 02:05:46.403
We are the melodies
and the notes of your opus,

02:05:46.487 --> 02:05:49.160
and we are the music of your life.

02:06:12.087 --> 02:06:15.636
Mr Holland, we would now like
to give something back to you.

02:06:16.407 --> 02:06:18.967
To you and to your wife,
who, along with you,

02:06:19.047 --> 02:06:22.278
has waited 30 years
for what we are about to hear.

02:06:23.167 --> 02:06:27.797
If you will, would you please
come up here and take this baton...

02:06:28.447 --> 02:06:32.201
and lead us in the first performance ever

02:06:32.287 --> 02:06:35.279
of "The American Symphony"
by Glenn Holland.

~ Let me tell you how

02:11:51.527 --> 02:11:54.678
~ How Ive lost love

02:11:55.767 --> 02:11:58.884
~ And how Ive found love

02:12:00.647 --> 02:12:07.405
~ In a world of broken dreams

02:12:09.127 --> 02:12:16.317
~ I was wrong to deny your feelings

02:12:17.687 --> 02:12:25.241
~ And I'm sorry if I`ve caused you pain

02:12:25.767 --> 02:12:28.839
~ I was lost then

02:12:29.807 --> 02:12:32.958
~ So confused then

02:12:34.087 --> 02:12:42.119
~ And I believe that
you would change that

02:12:42.807 --> 02:12:49.519
~ There are broken hearts we can mend

02:12:51.367 --> 02:12:59.763
~ Through the music
weve learned to love again

02:12:59.847 --> 02:13:02.998
~ Through the sad notes

02:13:04.007 --> 02:13:07.079
~ Through the years

02:13:08.967 --> 02:13:15.236
~ From the moment you were born

02:13:16.927 --> 02:13:19.999
~ I have lost you

02:13:21.247 --> 02:13:24.205
~ Now Ive found you

02:13:26.007 --> 02:13:30.000
~ Let me feel your heart

02:13:30.367 --> 02:13:32.358
~ Let me hear

02:13:35.047 --> 02:13:39.325
~ Your song

02:13:57.527 --> 02:14:00.200
(~ `Visions of a Sunset```by Shawn Stockman)

02:14:08.607 --> 02:14:13.237
~ Lived all my days

02:14:14.007 --> 02:14:18.478
~ Trying to embrace

02:14:19.287 --> 02:14:22.438
~ Life with my heart

02:14:22.527 --> 02:14:28.238
~ By all the beauty I feel and create

02:14:29.967 --> 02:14:34.597
~ It spins and moves

02:14:35.447 --> 02:14:39.918
~ Flows at my pace

02:14:40.767 --> 02:14:50.836
~ Telling its story
from the tear running down my face

02:14:50.927 --> 02:14:55.398
~ Visions of a sunset

02:14:55.487 --> 02:15:00.800
~ Just appear when I close my eyes

02:15:00.887 --> 02:15:06.439
~ Takes me closer to heaven

02:15:06.527 --> 02:15:15.117
~ When the flute starts to fly
and the violin cries

02:15:17.087 --> 02:15:23.356
- ~ Ohhhhh
- ~ Its all I need in my life

02:15:23.447 --> 02:15:27.156
~ Its all I need, and no one...

02:15:27.807 --> 02:15:35.646
~ Can take your place by my side

02:15:36.847 --> 02:15:39.042
~ Youre all inside of me

02:15:39.127 --> 02:15:43.598
~ Visions of a sunset

02:15:43.687 --> 02:15:49.000
~ Just appear when I close my eyes

02:15:49.087 --> 02:15:54.684
~ Takes me closer to heaven

02:15:54.767 --> 02:15:59.557
~ When the flute starts to fly
and the violin cries

02:15:59.647 --> 02:16:05.005
~ I will flee from all sorrow

02:16:05.087 --> 02:16:10.445
~ Like the wind blows from the sky

02:16:10.527 --> 02:16:16.124
~ Takes me closer to heaven

02:16:16.207 --> 02:16:23.841
~ When the flute starts to fly
and the violin cries

02:16:26.407 --> 02:16:28.398
~ Ohhh, oh, oh
