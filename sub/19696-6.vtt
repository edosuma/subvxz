DAN: Al, you wanted to be smart,
fun, funny and nice like me?

09:01.157 --> 09:02.907
This is not the way I would handle it.

09:03.180 --> 09:07.016
Okay. So if a guy can't pay me,
what do you suppose I do, exactly?

09:07.117 --> 09:09.688
Well, maybe you be nicer
and not kill him?

09:10.149 --> 09:12.008
(sighs): That's crazy,

09:12.133 --> 09:13.388
but I'll give it a shot.

09:13.424 --> 09:14.890
Speak of the devil.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.225
Here he is. Huh, Al?

09:17.250 --> 09:19.495
Don't you have something to
say to this nice florist?

09:20.281 --> 09:22.919
Sorry that I bashed your face in.

09:23.234 --> 09:24.763
Is it bad?

09:24.935 --> 09:26.602
What do you want to hear, man?

09:26.637 --> 09:28.170
(whimpers)

09:28.622 --> 09:30.544
Dan, I am so confused.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.604
This guy owes me money,
and he's still alive.

09:32.628 --> 09:36.278
What if, instead of him giving you
the five dollars that he owes you...

09:36.972 --> 09:39.448
he gives you $20 worth
of flowers from his shop?

09:39.557 --> 09:41.589
What am I gonna do
with a bunch of flowers?

09:41.613 --> 09:44.198
Well, maybe you can give
them to your wife Mae.

09:44.223 --> 09:47.128
If Mae wants flowers, she can go
to the churchyard and pick 'em.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.658
A little romantic gesture
goes a long way.

09:50.761 --> 09:52.528
Dan gave me a snow globe.

09:52.775 --> 09:56.055
It was very heavy and started
leaking almost immediately,

09:56.080 --> 09:57.463
but, oh, I loved it.

09:57.488 --> 09:59.101
Oh, my God, fine!

09:59.136 --> 10:01.036
Give me the dumb flowers
for my stupid wife.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.572
He's gonna take the flowers
for his dumb wife.

10:04.377 --> 10:06.342
DAN: See, Al? You keep it
up with this nice stuff,

10:06.367 --> 10:08.428
and all over town people'll
be doing favors for you.

10:08.453 --> 10:10.828
You'll be known as... a Godfather.

10:10.984 --> 10:12.945
FLORIST: That's actually
a good description,

10:13.039 --> 10:14.532
because I'm not related to him, but he has

10:14.557 --> 10:16.518
a sort of paternal interest
in my well-being.

10:20.257 --> 10:22.057
(sighs)

10:22.340 --> 10:24.236
I just found him irritating.

10:24.568 --> 10:26.329
But you didn't kill him.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.641
I didn't kill him.

I bought you these flowers,

to you, but now I am giving 'em to you.

11:55.311 --> 11:58.515
Al, you've never brought me
flowers before.

11:58.585 --> 12:02.107
Mae, I haven't treated you very good
because I was afraid you'd wise up

12:02.132 --> 12:03.892

12:03.927 --> 12:06.028
Oh, Al, I could never leave you.

I should've said "life" first.

Oh, Al, I liked that you said "love."

we're not just partners in life,

19:21.087 --> 19:22.938
we're partners in crime.

19:23.118 --> 19:26.460
Yeah, life includes crime.
Don't point the gun at me.

19:26.485 --> 19:28.292
- Point it at them.
- Oh, yeah.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.982
DEBORAH: Excuse me!

19:30.007 --> 19:34.234
No one messes with my
partner in life, meaning Dan.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.367
Hi, Dan. I'm sorry, Chris.

19:36.403 --> 19:38.469
- Drop it.
- No, you drop it.

19:38.505 --> 19:40.505
- No, you drop it.
- You drop it.

19:40.530 --> 19:41.607
- Drop it.
- Drop it.

19:41.632 --> 19:44.051
- Please drop it. Please?
- Come on, Deb, drop it.

19:44.076 --> 19:46.267
- Please drop it.
- Your broad ain't gonna shoot.

19:46.292 --> 19:47.651
She don't got the guts.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.548
Do the thing. Do the thing I taught you.

19:51.676 --> 19:55.019

Oh.

20:13.294 --> 20:15.147
This is why we time-travel.

20:15.442 --> 20:17.311
Moments like this.

20:17.477 --> 20:21.012
- So awesome.
- Okay, you guys got us.

CAPONE: You know, if someone
was gonna rob me blind,

20:31.880 --> 20:34.888
- I'm glad it was you, Dan.
- Al, I'm telling you,

20:34.977 --> 20:37.160
you remember all that <i> Godfather</i>
stuff that we talked about,

20:37.185 --> 20:38.545
and the Mafia will be huge.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.359
You won't even need the money
I took from you.

20:40.384 --> 20:42.826
You taught Al Capone
how to do the Mafia?

20:42.851 --> 20:45.369
Bye-bye, Mae. Bye. Bye.

20:45.850 --> 20:48.194
Al, later, skater.

20:50.944 --> 20:53.044
(electrical whining)

20:53.079 --> 20:55.608
(grunts) Yes, yes, yes.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.883
We are back, and we got the money still.

20:58.908 --> 21:00.946
- (laughter)
- Now we can buy the ice cream parlor.

21:00.971 --> 21:04.655
And most importantly, we saved
Al and Mae Capone's marriage.

21:06.275 --> 21:08.986
- Absolutely, that was number one priority.
- That never mattered at all.

21:10.674 --> 21:14.640
Aw, gross, there's a sandwich in my
pocket that's, like, 100 years old now.
