00:20.088 --> 00:23.324
All my life, I had been looking
for my prince.

00:24.926 --> 00:26.994
You know, someone deep, someone
sweet,

00:28.530 --> 00:29.963
who could make me laugh...

00:29.965 --> 00:34.401
Ashley and me talked on the
phone all night and

00:34.403 --> 00:39.340
I totally cracked her up with my
witty jokes and funny noises,

00:39.342 --> 00:44.578
And right from the very first
second our chemistry was like...

00:44.580 --> 00:45.946
hel-lo!

00:45.948 --> 00:48.782
And we're both really sensitive.

00:48.784 --> 00:53.721
We have this kind of
artsy-fartsy going, so one day,

00:53.723 --> 00:57.658
we made a painting...

00:57.660 --> 01:00.594
Everything we do together is
fun.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.865
Fuck you, Dylan and Ashlee.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.581
Jorge, Jorge... we've been over
this before.

01:54.849 --> 01:55.916
You can't smoke in Debby's.

01:56.451 --> 01:57.418
No, man, I think you can.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.685
I'm, I'm the manager here,

01:58.687 --> 02:02.990
I'm fairly well versed in the
rules, c'mon buddy put it out.

02:03.658 --> 02:05.125
Don't you ever bend the rules?

02:05.894 --> 02:06.693
No...

02:07.729 --> 02:09.430
Corporate puppet.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.004
How's your... food?

02:30.752 --> 02:32.886
It's Saturday night, we're gonna
do it.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.689
We are gonna doooooo it!

02:36.224 --> 02:37.891
Getting paid and laid tonight,
bebe.

02:38.193 --> 02:39.993
Paid and laid.

02:40.962 --> 02:42.563
I, I don't even know what that
means?

02:42.764 --> 02:45.132
It means what we want it to
mean, okay?

02:45.134 --> 02:51.171
It means what we want it to
mean. You dig?

02:51.173 --> 02:52.172
Um, no, I don't...dig.

02:52.174 --> 02:54.208
Ricky what is with you?

02:54.210 --> 02:56.643
Come on, stop being such a
buzzkill.

02:56.845 --> 02:58.145
Now grab your cock and put on
some socks,

02:58.147 --> 03:02.649
cause we are gonna do this town
up and do it right, senorrrita!

03:08.690 --> 03:10.757
Paid and laid. We're doing it!

03:11.092 --> 03:12.226
How exactly are we "doing it?"

03:12.228 --> 03:16.563
Uh, well I don't know? Numero
uno, hog, got you out of the
house so there's that.

03:16.565 --> 03:17.564
W is a W

03:17.566 --> 03:20.234
I'm back where I work! It's a
lateral move at best.

03:20.236 --> 03:23.036
Alright well look... that's just
round one of the festivities.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.972
You're NOT going to believe
round two.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.275
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, you're not
going to believe round two.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.844
Please stop repeating things
please.

03:36.584 --> 03:40.721
Soooo... when do you go into
production?

03:41.289 --> 03:42.990
Really, really not in the mood,
nope.

03:48.029 --> 03:49.263
When do you go into production?

03:51.232 --> 03:53.166
Next month.

03:53.568 --> 03:56.537
Great. So you go into production
on your motion picture next
month?

03:57.872 --> 03:59.273
Is it fully cast yet?

03:59.807 --> 04:02.175
No, no, it is, it is, not fully
cast yet.

04:02.877 --> 04:07.247
We're still uh, we're still
looking for our, our last two
actresses.

04:07.582 --> 04:10.918
Wow, well just fantastic, that's
just, that's just super.

04:11.152 --> 04:12.185
That's just deluxe.

04:12.187 --> 04:14.855
Now do they have to be well
known or...?

04:16.157 --> 04:19.226
Do they have to be... Ricky,
Ricky, Ricky?

04:19.228 --> 04:21.295
They have to be well known these
actresses?

04:21.696 --> 04:25.232
No, no, we're actually looking
for two total newcomers.

04:25.767 --> 04:29.903
This makes me happy as the
film's director, because I like
to work with fresh faces, so --

04:30.271 --> 04:34.274
Uh... me too uh, as the
movie's... executive producer...

04:35.043 --> 04:39.913
Hey, man. Ahh, I can't work
Saturday. Can I get a 'double'
next week?

04:40.248 --> 04:41.815
Oh sure, no problem.

04:44.152 --> 04:45.352
Ah you know what,

04:45.354 --> 04:49.189
these broken down fillies are
just gonna get in the way of
round two anyhow.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.959
Round two, baby. Round two.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.062
Yum, Yum.

04:55.997 --> 04:58.832
Doing it long and doing it
strong!

04:59.100 --> 05:01.001
Maybe we should just shoot each
other.

05:02.203 --> 05:04.671
Hey, you seem a bit down man.
What up, hog?

05:05.139 --> 05:07.207
It's Saturday night and I'm with
you.

05:09.877 --> 05:13.046
Not for long, bebe. Not for
long.

05:14.616 --> 05:16.183
So when do you go into
production--

05:16.185 --> 05:18.018
Gary Kless is getting married.

05:19.220 --> 05:20.287
Yeah, me too. Who cares?

05:20.289 --> 05:22.222
Oh what's that, the actresses
don't need to be fresh faces...?

05:22.224 --> 05:24.658
That leaves just you and me.
Just you and me.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.029
We are the only two freaks from
high school to NEVER be married.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.164
Can I asked you a question? How
the hell do you even know that?

05:31.332 --> 05:33.834
I keep track on Facebook and
Twitter.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.203
God, Gary is so lucky, man.

05:36.871 --> 05:40.040
Oh that's weird, I thought you
get your period at the end of
the month.

05:40.942 --> 05:42.409
MEN don't get jealous of other
MEN getting married!

05:43.244 --> 05:45.078
Men should be jealous of us.

05:45.246 --> 05:46.713
Oh, I strongly disagree.

05:46.715 --> 05:48.982
Jesus, is why you've been
Captain Negativo all night?

05:48.984 --> 05:51.051
Cause that fat bastard Gary
Kless is getting married?

05:51.053 --> 05:55.255
There was this guy on Dr. Phil
who said that it's as likely for
a woman over forty

05:55.257 --> 05:57.090
to get hit by lightning or,

05:57.291 --> 05:59.760
or killed by a terrorist than
meet a husband.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.229
What if the same thing goes for
men?

06:02.231 --> 06:05.265
What if Gary just got lucky and
he made a pact with God and/or
Satan?

06:08.269 --> 06:10.437
I can't go to another of these
weddings alone.

06:11.239 --> 06:12.839
It's just too depressing.

06:13.174 --> 06:14.408
You're not going to be going
alone okay man?

06:14.842 --> 06:15.842
You're going to be going be with
me.

06:16.077 --> 06:17.210
That's...not comforting.

06:17.212 --> 06:19.312
What is wrong with you? Haven't
you seen "Wedding Crashers?"

06:19.314 --> 06:22.215
Common, all those losers in our
class are married off,

06:22.217 --> 06:25.052
we're going to cleaning up
bigger than Owen Wilson and
Vinny Vaughn!

06:29.924 --> 06:31.124
Hot filly. Three o'clock.

06:32.794 --> 06:34.761
I forgot my compass.

06:35.430 --> 06:37.330
She's right over there, look at
her, look at her.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.300
That girl is seventeen, tops.

06:41.102 --> 06:42.803
So what? Means she's single.

06:43.337 --> 06:44.771
You'd have sex with an underage
girl?

06:45.139 --> 06:46.306
I'm not a monster, no!

06:46.308 --> 06:49.843
I'd take her out for cookies and
milk shakes until the day she
turned eighteen

06:50.178 --> 06:51.278
and then plow her.

06:52.113 --> 06:53.480
Sorry I misjudged you.

06:59.053 --> 07:00.854
Should've proposed to Roz when
we were together.

07:01.155 --> 07:02.255
You dated her in high school.

07:02.257 --> 07:05.225
I had no idea there would be so
few good ones after that.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.994
It's like, it's like in hockey,
you know,

07:07.996 --> 07:09.996
a team goes to the finals and
loses, everybody says

07:09.998 --> 07:12.165
"Hey you know don't worry, we'll
get 'em next year"

07:12.366 --> 07:14.000
what if there is no next year.

07:14.335 --> 07:15.936
What if there is no other Roz
and

07:15.938 --> 07:18.972
I never go to the Stanley Cup
finals of love ever again?

07:19.173 --> 07:20.774
K, K if you hadn't mentioned
hockey there,

07:21.142 --> 07:22.743
that might have been the gayest
thing I've ever heard.

07:23.111 --> 07:26.346
Come on man! Get your game face
on, d-o-g.

07:26.348 --> 07:27.881
We have a wedding to crash!

07:28.149 --> 07:29.783
First of all, we were invited...

07:30.118 --> 07:31.518
second of all, all our friends
are married.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.120
There ARE NO single women!

07:33.254 --> 07:34.287
What about the--

07:34.289 --> 07:35.222
She's seventeen!

07:35.224 --> 07:38.258
We don't know that for a fact!
Jeez... would ya... okay you
what...

07:40.027 --> 07:42.896
I'm going in, okay...? I'm going
in.

07:46.934 --> 07:47.968
Please, God,

07:47.970 --> 07:51.238
help me find my soulmate before
I'm hit by lightning or

07:51.439 --> 07:53.306
killed by a terrorist.

08:31.412 --> 08:33.580
Oh, hey, Kings won.

08:36.517 --> 08:40.320
Three goals and two assists,
you're on fire.

08:43.257 --> 08:46.326
NHL.com has pop-up ads for
"E-Happily"?

08:47.361 --> 08:49.462
What the hell. They NEVER have
before...

09:18.960 --> 09:21.061
You have no
responses.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.463
Yeah..

09:23.865 --> 09:24.497
Hey, man.

09:24.499 --> 09:28.168
Hey, Jorge. I was just checking
the...the hockey scores, what's
up?

09:28.469 --> 09:31.571
Ahh, I'm gonna need next
Saturday off too. I'm getting
married.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.373
What?

09:33.375 --> 09:35.575
Yeah, I know, my mother's been
on my case.

09:35.577 --> 09:37.577
You're twenty-seven, you bum,
what are you waiting for?

09:37.579 --> 09:39.579
Twenty-seven really isn't that
old.

09:39.581 --> 09:41.448
So can I have Saturday off or
what?

09:41.883 --> 09:42.649
No.

09:42.651 --> 09:44.251
What?

09:44.253 --> 09:47.287
Oh, uh, I'm sorry. I, I meant
"yes." Of course... of course...

09:50.291 --> 09:51.091
Jorge...

09:52.360 --> 09:53.326
Where, where did you meet her?

09:53.628 --> 09:54.327
Who?

09:54.329 --> 10:00.267
E-Happily, man. It's
surprisingly effective.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.076
You have one
response.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.250
You found your wife?

10:17.385 --> 10:18.919
Yep. Last night.

10:19.487 --> 10:21.054
You went cruising without me?

10:21.056 --> 10:25.058
Uhm we've never cruised and I
didn't have to go anywhere.

10:25.259 --> 10:26.326
Found her on my computer.

10:26.527 --> 10:27.661
Oh... what porn site?

10:28.229 --> 10:30.664
Wasn't a porn sit..."E-Happily!"

10:31.565 --> 10:32.332
I...joined it last week.

10:32.334 --> 10:34.134
What do you mean, you joined it?

10:34.136 --> 10:35.402
Ah, I don't think I was being
cryptic.

10:35.404 --> 10:37.537
I joined E-Happily last week. To
meet my soulmate.

10:38.439 --> 10:39.606
And it worked.

10:40.241 --> 10:43.310
Poor, sweet, crazy bastard you.

10:44.045 --> 10:45.312
I've never been more sane.

10:45.314 --> 10:46.546
This woman's perfect for me.
Perfect!

10:47.248 --> 10:48.581
Oh, she loves all the same
things I do,

10:49.250 --> 10:51.117
hockey, cats, Albert Brooks
movies,

10:51.252 --> 10:53.053
spooning after sex--

10:53.688 --> 10:54.721
Alright whatever, what does she
look like?

10:54.723 --> 10:57.324
I don't know... and you should
see the e-mails she wrote to me.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.259
Funny, smart, sweet--

10:59.261 --> 11:01.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, just back up, hold the
phone.

11:01.363 --> 11:03.163
What do you mean, you don't know
what she looks like?

11:03.165 --> 11:04.497
She didn't post a picture for
some reason.

11:04.499 --> 11:06.266
Oh, that's a real puzzler.

11:06.268 --> 11:10.003
It's 'cause she's a dude, she's
a dude Ricky or looks like a
dude.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.204
No...

11:11.206 --> 11:14.274
Listen hoggy dog. There's only
that woman wouldn't post a
picture?

11:14.276 --> 11:16.376
'Cause, god bless her, she's
obviously hideous.

11:16.378 --> 11:18.278
Look, there's a million reasons
she wouldn't put up a picture.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.981
No, no... there's one, one...
she looks like "Shrek."

11:20.983 --> 11:24.317
What if she does? Did you learn
anything from that movie?

11:24.319 --> 11:25.585
It's what's inside that counts.

11:25.587 --> 11:28.388
Yeah in fairy tales, you idiot,
not real life!

11:29.590 --> 11:32.359
Her name is Danita. What a
beautiful name.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.227
I've never heard that name
before.

11:34.395 --> 11:35.295
"Danita..."

11:35.297 --> 11:36.396
You sure it isn't Dan

11:36.398 --> 11:40.400
Ita? Like that's her last Ita,
like Dan Ita

11:40.402 --> 11:41.401
Can't you be happy for me?

11:41.403 --> 11:43.236
Alright common You haven't even
met this person!

11:43.238 --> 11:45.372
I am, tomorrow. I'm meeting her
at the Black Cat for drinks.

11:45.374 --> 11:47.374
Look don't do this okay please
Ricky, don't do this.

11:48.342 --> 11:49.342
I have to, Seth.

11:51.112 --> 11:52.645
Danita is my destiny.

11:54.515 --> 11:55.382
Okay...

11:55.384 --> 11:59.285
might want to bring a condom for
Dan just in case.

11:59.620 --> 12:00.420
Shut up.

12:14.335 --> 12:15.468
What the hell is that in your
head?

12:16.137 --> 12:17.137
What are you doing here?!

12:17.272 --> 12:19.372
You know, in case this dude
tries to rob you.

12:19.374 --> 12:23.410
Why are you wearing shoe polish
on your head?

12:23.412 --> 12:24.577
Bald is beautiful bebe.

12:24.579 --> 12:28.181
It's not shoe polish! And, and
bald is beautiful. Not balding.

12:28.382 --> 12:31.317
True dat, true dat. Okay look,
I'll be here at the bar.

12:31.519 --> 12:34.821
Now if she turns out, you see I
said she this time.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.323
If she turns out to be a psycho,
just wave or cough or something
like that,

12:37.325 --> 12:39.659
I'll stroll by and I'll say that
uh...

12:39.661 --> 12:41.628
your Mother died and you're
needed at the cemetery, k?

12:41.630 --> 12:44.831
I'm going to go to the table,
please leave. Okay please...

12:44.833 --> 12:47.801

amigo, common.

12:47.803 --> 12:49.636
Ricky you've never met this
woman before,

12:49.638 --> 12:51.404
I just want to be here to make
sure everything goes okay.

12:52.406 --> 12:54.207
Thanks, man.

12:54.809 --> 12:56.209

13:44.391 --> 13:45.592
Ricky Miller?

13:45.826 --> 13:46.893
How do you know my name?

13:47.294 --> 13:48.695
I'm Danita...your date.

13:49.730 --> 13:51.364
Holy shit!

13:53.701 --> 13:55.902
Of, of course. Of course you're
my date.

13:57.438 --> 13:58.471
Yeah.

13:58.473 --> 14:00.206
Unless you were expecting
somebody else and

14:00.208 --> 14:02.308
you're already cheating on me,
you bastard.

14:02.443 --> 14:03.910
No, no, I would never do that.

14:04.378 --> 14:07.347
Okay...Sorry I called you a
bastard.

14:07.748 --> 14:09.616
It's okay...

14:13.287 --> 14:15.255
You look a bit different than
your picture.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.457
I mean, better.

14:17.892 --> 14:21.494
You too. Much better, since you
didn't have one...

14:21.862 --> 14:24.531
I, I... really look better than
my picture?

14:24.533 --> 14:28.368
I knew it was a good idea to use
a picture of Steve Buscemi.

14:30.204 --> 14:31.471
He's an off-beat looking actor--

14:31.473 --> 14:36.776
He was in "Fargo" and he was
'Mr. Pink' in "Reservoir Dogs."

14:38.946 --> 14:40.280
That was funny, Ricky.

14:40.282 --> 14:41.881
Steve Buscemi...

14:46.420 --> 14:48.655
So ummm, are you going to ask me
to sit down?

14:49.290 --> 14:52.425
No, no, keep standing, this,
this seems to be working for me.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.399
I can't believe one of your cats
is named Sidney Crosby.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.268
I told you I loved hockey. Field
hockey and ice.

15:02.270 --> 15:03.503
Am I dreaming this?

15:03.505 --> 15:06.739
Cause then we'd both be dreaming
and

15:06.741 --> 15:09.309
then it would be like the movie
"Inception" and

15:09.311 --> 15:10.310
I walked out of that.

15:10.312 --> 15:11.511
I, I hated that movie too!

15:11.513 --> 15:12.512
Really?

15:12.514 --> 15:15.515
Wow, I thought I was the only
one.

15:15.517 --> 15:16.883
No, no, I hated it too.

15:16.885 --> 15:17.784
Hated it.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.955
God... you know everything
tonight has been so perfect.

15:22.389 --> 15:26.893
Could you jab me in the eye with
your spoon or set my arm on
fire? I, I just.

15:27.328 --> 15:29.796
I just, want to make sure that
this is really happening.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.631
How about I do this?

15:32.533 --> 15:34.500
Holy shit!

15:36.971 --> 15:40.440
Um, uh, could you excuse me for
a second?

15:40.442 --> 15:43.443
Um just gonna... slip into
something more comfortable.

15:50.584 --> 15:51.451
Go home!

15:51.453 --> 15:54.587
Ohhh, she is like
uber-movie-star-hot.

15:54.822 --> 15:56.356
Is she crazy or just retarded?

15:56.657 --> 15:57.857
Neither. She just likes me!

15:58.292 --> 16:00.693
No, no, no, no there has to be a
reason.

16:00.695 --> 16:03.963
You're positive she can see...
like out of both eyes?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.499
Okay, I am begging you, go home.
You're ruining this.

16:06.501 --> 16:09.002
Okay, okay, okay, just, just do
me one favor k?

16:09.336 --> 16:11.537
If, if she's retarded,

16:11.539 --> 16:13.606
can you see if she has any other
retarded friends who look like
her.

16:13.874 --> 16:15.475
Stop saying retarded, it's
actually offensive.

16:15.776 --> 16:17.277
What are we, on Oprah here?

16:17.279 --> 16:18.444
Good bye, good night, good
night,

16:18.446 --> 16:20.046
It's very vexing dog.

16:20.048 --> 16:22.649
There's got to be a reason, has
to be a reason.

16:25.753 --> 16:28.721
Thought you were going to slip
into something more comfortable.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.791
Yeah, yeah, but I looked in the
mirror and decided

16:32.326 --> 16:35.595
I was "the bomb" also "off the
hook,"

16:37.498 --> 16:38.631
as the kids say.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.867
Do kids still say that?

16:41.302 --> 16:43.703
Yeah, kids over thirty-nine,
yeah.

16:43.705 --> 16:45.972
You're funny...

16:45.974 --> 16:47.640
Funny how? What do you mean,
funny?

16:47.642 --> 16:49.375
Funny like a clown?

16:51.445 --> 16:54.347
Sorry, oh my god, sorry I'm
trying too hard.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.582
I'm nervous.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.751
You're nervous with me?!

16:59.687 --> 17:01.688
Are you retarded?

17:03.691 --> 17:07.093
I'm, I'm sorry it's just that I
mean...

17:07.461 --> 17:09.462
you're, you're gorgeous and
amazing and...

17:09.697 --> 17:11.364
why the hell are you here?

17:11.665 --> 17:12.598
Excuse me?

17:14.001 --> 17:15.802
Why did you choose someone like
me?

17:16.670 --> 17:20.373
I was just blown away by your
E-happily profile.

17:21.008 --> 17:23.643
But I used my real picture and I
wrote down my real job.

17:24.345 --> 17:26.112
Can we go back to your place
now?

17:27.448 --> 17:31.584
Yeah... okay... uh good idea,
thanks.

17:36.123 --> 17:39.759
I've never seen a man weep and
climax at the same time before.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.795
Thank you.

17:44.031 --> 17:47.633
It's just, I've... I've been
waiting all my life

17:48.502 --> 17:49.369
for someone like you.

17:49.670 --> 17:51.571
Exactly like you.

17:52.406 --> 17:53.373
Right...

17:53.708 --> 17:58.144
You're smart, you're sweet and
you're Maxim cover beautiful and

17:58.146 --> 18:00.413
it's like you don't even know
it.

18:00.415 --> 18:03.616
You love hockey and cats and
Albert Brooks and,

18:03.618 --> 18:06.886
and you get my jokes about
obscure homely actors.

18:08.489 --> 18:09.856
You're amazing, Danita.

18:09.858 --> 18:12.425
You're beyond amazing. You're,
you're 'amazing-tastic.'

18:14.461 --> 18:16.562
Well you're not too bad
yourself.

18:19.733 --> 18:22.468
You asked before why I chose
you. Do you still want to know?

18:23.170 --> 18:25.171
I'm... not sure.

18:25.639 --> 18:27.440
You were the only one who said
"yes" to a date.

18:27.775 --> 18:29.575
Yeah, right.

18:29.577 --> 18:31.878
Yeah I didn't post a picture,
remember?

18:33.180 --> 18:35.415
You were the only one who wanted
to go out with me,

18:35.417 --> 18:37.150
even though you had no idea what
I looked like.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.620
Wow, so all those sitcoms and
beer commercials were wrong.

18:41.422 --> 18:43.089
It does pay to have depth.

18:45.426 --> 18:47.894
Holy shit-balls, I have to go.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.463
Holy-shit balls. I like that.

18:55.436 --> 18:57.503
I would love to see you again.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.474
I... hope you want to see me
again too.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.843
Yeah, I think I'm leaning
towards that, yeah.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.978
Sorry. I have to go. I...

19:06.213 --> 19:09.215
say hi to your cats when they
wake up.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.817
Say hi to yours.

19:10.819 --> 19:13.586
Put on ESPN and text me when you
know the hockey scores.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.188
You're incredible.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.510
Do you have Alzheimer's?

19:38.011 --> 19:41.481
I have Loveheimer's.

19:50.792 --> 19:56.896
Hey! You haven't been returning
my calls or texts all day.

19:57.064 --> 19:58.164
What the heck happened?!

19:58.166 --> 19:59.165
With what?

19:59.167 --> 20:02.502
Now don't you dare be coy.
Common I need details, dog.

20:02.804 --> 20:05.805
Look I never thought I'd have to
live vicariously through you...

20:05.807 --> 20:07.773
Last night was unbelievable.

20:07.775 --> 20:09.275
No, no it was better than that.

20:09.277 --> 20:10.643
We stayed in bed and talked all
night,

20:10.645 --> 20:11.744
it was just like Dylan and
Ashlee.

20:12.112 --> 20:13.279
Who the fuck are Dylan and...

20:13.281 --> 20:14.280
HOLD ON a second.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.718
You...slept with that piece
of...

20:19.186 --> 20:20.219
lady, you slept with her?

20:22.890 --> 20:24.290
And, I'm not even talking about
the sex,

20:25.158 --> 20:26.225
although holy crap, that was
good.

20:26.227 --> 20:27.760
Okay, o-kay!

20:28.095 --> 20:29.228
What the hell is going on? What
the hell is going?

20:30.197 --> 20:34.000
What's going on!?

20:34.535 --> 20:35.301
She's like a '10,' right?

20:35.802 --> 20:37.236
I, I don't assign women numbers.

20:37.238 --> 20:40.206
No, she's, she's a 10! That girl
is a 10, you're like...

20:40.607 --> 20:41.974
no offense Ricky, you're like a
4.

20:42.142 --> 20:44.644
And, and... if you're a 4, she's
like 20!

20:45.145 --> 20:47.313
It's because I went out with her
without knowing

20:47.681 --> 20:48.548
what she looked like!

20:48.550 --> 20:51.217
was sweet and real.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.722
You are so naive, it's adorable.

21:06.133 --> 21:09.135
Oh, no, no lunch is fine. I, I
look better around noon anyway.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.237
Not, not even joking about that
actually.

21:11.905 --> 21:15.241
It's just, nights aren't always
great. It's when I paint and...

21:15.709 --> 21:17.276
Yeah, yeah that is so cool.

21:17.278 --> 21:19.245
You know I've never actually
dated an artist.

21:20.948 --> 21:23.249
Ah... actually, there are many
professions of which

21:23.251 --> 21:25.251
I have not dated a woman.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.287
Did I just say "of which?"

21:34.695 --> 21:37.363
Hey, ask first. I'm not a piece
of meat.

21:37.365 --> 21:38.798
Yes, you are.

21:40.801 --> 21:43.269
I really, really do think that
it's great you're an artist.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.204
I mean what is that like?

21:45.339 --> 21:47.106
Ummm... I'd prefer to talk about
your job.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.274
Why?

21:48.276 --> 21:49.675
I'm sure it's interesting.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.211
Well you know, you manage a
staff,

21:52.713 --> 21:54.313
and you try to make customers
happy.

21:56.917 --> 21:58.250
I've... you're going to have to
trust me on that.

21:58.719 --> 22:00.019
Than why do you do it?

22:00.187 --> 22:02.321
Well I guess I prefer it to
being homeless.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.824
I, I... okay I started out as a
waiter,

22:05.258 --> 22:08.127
thinking I'd be an artist... Uh
well a writer.

22:08.862 --> 22:10.296
But you know, that didn't work
out so...

22:11.132 --> 22:16.135
Oh well you know... the, the
book industry is so corrupt,

22:18.071 --> 22:19.071
It's all who you know.

22:19.906 --> 22:22.308
I've never heard that before.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.878
Oh yeah, yeah it's like every
son or daughter

22:25.880 --> 22:27.780
of a famous author has a book
deal.

22:29.149 --> 22:30.282
Like who?

22:32.152 --> 22:33.953
Ummm, there's, there's, there's
um...

22:36.723 --> 22:41.927
Mark Hemmingway? And, and
there's Kevin Grisham.

22:44.398 --> 22:48.401
Yeah, yeah I made those up, I'm
sorry.

22:49.269 --> 22:51.804
Okay the truth is, I, I only
wrote one book and

22:52.339 --> 22:53.305
I didn't even finish it.

22:53.307 --> 22:55.975
You don't have to talk about
this if you don't want.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.810
Thank you so much.

23:00.247 --> 23:03.249
Ac, you know actually I do feel
comfortable

23:04.317 --> 23:07.253
talking to you about my writing,
or non-writing.

23:10.157 --> 23:12.358
Um, I... feel like I could tell
you anything.

23:14.995 --> 23:18.264
God, sorry that, that's a stupid
thing to say on a second date.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.766
No, no, no, I thought it was
sweet.

23:21.001 --> 23:22.935
A bit pathetic, but sweet.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.871
No, seriously, I loved it.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.941
See? You really are the perfect
woman.

23:30.343 --> 23:31.310
Oh I... don't know about that.

23:31.312 --> 23:35.748
Yeah, you are, you are. Trust
me.

24:02.242 --> 24:05.478
Hey! It's Saturday night, we are
gonna do it.

24:06.213 --> 24:07.313
We are gonna doooooo it!

24:07.315 --> 24:10.282
Common, time to get paid and
laid Ricky.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.384
Paid and...

24:13.420 --> 24:15.287
Come on, hog. It's been almost
nine days!

24:15.789 --> 24:17.156
I can't believe you're not over
this chick yet.

24:17.158 --> 24:19.425
Ten days! It's been ten days.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.294
And stop saying "paid and laid!"

24:22.829 --> 24:24.530
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING!

24:27.367 --> 24:28.834
No it doesn't, no it doesn't.

24:28.836 --> 24:30.870
What, is someone gonna pay us to
have sex?

24:31.338 --> 24:33.372
Huh? Huh? What the fuck does it
mean, cowboy?!!

24:36.209 --> 24:39.178
I don't know it's just something
I say...

24:39.379 --> 24:40.346
to keep things light and airy.

24:40.348 --> 24:44.116
Did you just call me "Cowboy"
Ricky? Ric, Ricky.. you drunk?

24:44.317 --> 24:45.284
Yes, I believe so.

24:45.852 --> 24:46.919
Hey you don't drink.

24:46.921 --> 24:49.255
I do now, hog! I do now.

24:50.891 --> 24:52.424
I still don't know what the HELL
happened.

24:53.894 --> 24:56.295
I, I was... the perfect woman
pops into my life,

24:57.330 --> 25:00.232
I tell her she's perfect and she
runs away faster than...

25:00.234 --> 25:03.803
who's a fast woman?

25:04.805 --> 25:08.340
Flo-Jo? Oh, shit, she's dead,
isn't she?

25:08.942 --> 25:10.209
I'm going to make you some
coffee, man.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.478
No I don't want coffee! I want
Danita!

25:13.213 --> 25:17.349
I finally met a woman I feel
that that magical thing

25:17.351 --> 25:20.486
assholes brag about at parties.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.391
Please God, don't take her away
from me.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.861
Not after I've waited so long.

25:29.029 --> 25:29.595
You're out of coffee.

25:30.063 --> 25:31.363
Swissmiss?

25:39.339 --> 25:40.606
It's Danita.

25:40.941 --> 25:41.974
What?

25:42.242 --> 25:43.309
It's Danita.

25:45.378 --> 25:49.181
Ha, ha, ha. That's twice, God.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.584
Shit, you're good.

25:55.088 --> 25:55.955
Hey...

25:59.259 --> 26:00.459
Hi...

26:02.362 --> 26:04.530
You're not gonna to run out
again, are you?

26:04.532 --> 26:06.332
'Cause, this time, I'll just
order an appetizer.

26:06.533 --> 26:07.900
I'm so sorry...

26:08.134 --> 26:09.635
No, no, it's okay,

26:10.070 --> 26:11.403
I was just trying to diffuse an
awkward moment.

26:13.406 --> 26:17.643
Now I'm going to try and diffuse
this one.

26:18.311 --> 26:20.346
I like you, Ricky. I really like
you.

26:20.348 --> 26:22.147
I really, really, really like
you.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.350
That's the most 'reallys' I've
ever said in one sentence.

26:24.584 --> 26:25.584
Really?! Me too.

26:25.586 --> 26:28.988
It's, it's funny because I've
always hated

26:29.222 --> 26:30.623
ALL those movies where,

26:30.625 --> 26:32.124
where a couple falls in love
right away,

26:32.126 --> 26:33.626
but now I know it just pissed me
off 'cause

26:33.628 --> 26:34.593
it had never happened to me.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.029
I'm married.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.400
You said I was perfect, Ricky.

26:41.402 --> 26:43.969
I'm not perfect. I'm a... I'm a
jerk.

26:45.372 --> 26:46.305
Yeah...

26:46.307 --> 26:47.940
No I know it was wrong, I know.

26:47.942 --> 26:50.476
Look, I've been married for nine
years. Nine miserable years.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.512
And just one day, I was at my
friend Anna's place,

26:54.080 --> 26:56.382
she's on E-Happily, and I saw
your profile.

26:56.384 --> 27:00.286
It was so vulnerable, so wear
your heart on your sleeve sweet.

27:00.288 --> 27:03.088
You, you said you'd been waiting
all your life

27:03.090 --> 27:04.356
to meet your "heart-ner,"

27:04.358 --> 27:07.593
and what a sweet word, and that
even though you were agnostic,

27:08.361 --> 27:09.995
you prayed to God she was still
out there.

27:09.997 --> 27:14.199
Wow, you really did read my
profile.

27:15.702 --> 27:16.936
It got to me.

27:18.271 --> 27:19.405
And I thought you know

27:19.407 --> 27:20.539
maybe I don't have to be
miserable and...

27:21.408 --> 27:23.575
I just joined so I can meet
you.

27:27.147 --> 27:29.381
I just pretended to be single
and an artist,

27:31.518 --> 27:33.319
I just pretended to be the
person

27:33.321 --> 27:35.287
I used to be back when I was...

27:35.455 --> 27:37.523
still alive and...

27:40.460 --> 27:42.394
Do you really have cats?

27:43.029 --> 27:46.732
Yes... Two. Sidney Crosby and
Chairman Meow.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.369
Cool, that's all I cared about.

27:50.371 --> 27:53.005
Now can you just get a divorce
and marry me by six tonight?

27:53.007 --> 27:55.607
You're great, you're so great
know that?

27:56.376 --> 27:58.477
I can never see you again,
Ricky.

28:01.081 --> 28:02.481
Look you don't know my husband.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.317
He'll just, he'll never allow me
to leave him.

28:05.685 --> 28:08.454
Never allow a 'great man' like
him to be embarrassed...

28:09.055 --> 28:11.557
Uh, who cares if his precious
ego is bruised,

28:12.092 --> 28:13.392
you're miserable and we should
be together--

28:13.994 --> 28:15.160
He'd kill me.

28:17.664 --> 28:20.366
He would kill me. He's said
that, again and again,

28:20.567 --> 28:22.568
"if you ever walk out that door,
you ungrateful bitch,

28:22.570 --> 28:24.069
I will kill you."

28:24.537 --> 28:26.338
Only he didn't say it quite as
nice.

28:27.774 --> 28:28.307
Jesus.

28:28.309 --> 28:31.176
Yeah he's a bad guy, Ricky. He's
a bad guy.

28:31.411 --> 28:33.412
I didn't know that when I met
him, but oh god...

28:35.281 --> 28:37.316
he'd kill both of us right now
if he saw us together.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.553
That's interesting.

28:42.422 --> 28:44.356
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ricky.
You...

28:45.792 --> 28:49.294
you're "the one," and... I can
never see you again.

29:06.780 --> 29:09.481
My Hickory Grilled Chicken
Sandwich isn't "hickory" enough.

29:11.284 --> 29:12.084
Huh?

29:12.086 --> 29:15.788
Am I not speaking English? I
said it lacked hickory.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.324
Well... that's life.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.293
What?

29:21.661 --> 29:24.430
I, I'm sorry... sir.

29:25.298 --> 29:28.700
You wanted more of something and
you were disappointed.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.403
It hurts, doesn't it?

29:31.538 --> 29:33.138
That's a little melodramatic.

29:34.474 --> 29:37.209
Hello...

29:37.777 --> 29:40.412
Holy shit-balls!

29:41.815 --> 29:44.216
Yes, ya, ya, I will meet you
anywhere.

29:47.187 --> 29:48.487
Where?

30:02.168 --> 30:03.669
God, is it good to see you.

30:04.637 --> 30:08.674
I wanted to meet you here...
this is my happy place.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.545
I knew you'd love it too.

30:14.714 --> 30:17.549
They um, they show movies up on
that wall...

30:18.184 --> 30:20.419
over the graves of dead movie
stars.

30:20.887 --> 30:21.687
They don't mind?

30:22.322 --> 30:23.856
No one said anything.

30:25.525 --> 30:27.459
Guess what movie they're playing
tonight, Ricky.

30:29.829 --> 30:30.863
Um...

30:31.231 --> 30:32.231
Guess.

30:33.466 --> 30:34.399
Ahhhh "Cool Runnings?"

30:36.436 --> 30:37.903
I'm, I'm... really bad at
guessing--

30:39.439 --> 30:40.839
"Lost in America."

30:41.474 --> 30:42.708
That's my favorite movie!

30:43.443 --> 30:47.279
OMG, you read my whole profile.

30:53.153 --> 30:54.753
Tonight was great.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.822
I was so happy you called.
Beyond happy.

30:57.624 --> 30:58.624
Exultant.

30:58.626 --> 31:01.426
I don't think I've ever used
that word before.

31:02.595 --> 31:04.496
I couldn't stop thinking about
you.

31:05.498 --> 31:07.533
I can't go back to my old life
now.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.535
I deserve to be happy. I...

31:10.403 --> 31:12.204
I deserve someone like you.

31:12.339 --> 31:16.375
So, when are you going to tell
your husband you're leaving him?

31:16.377 --> 31:18.243
Christ, how are you going to
tell him

31:18.444 --> 31:19.478
you're going to leave him.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.946
I'm not going to tell him.

31:21.414 --> 31:22.447
Uh but uh...

31:22.749 --> 31:24.449
We have to kill him, Ricky.

31:25.652 --> 31:27.486
That's the only way we can ever
be together.

31:30.857 --> 31:32.491
Yeah, okay.

31:38.631 --> 31:39.865
Danita wants me to kill her
husband.

31:40.300 --> 31:40.832
Pardon?

31:40.834 --> 31:42.801
She said if she ever tried to
leave him,

31:42.803 --> 31:44.636
he'd find her and kill her.

31:45.205 --> 31:46.305
Wow what an asshole.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.475
Well, at least you got a chance
to say goodbye to her.

31:50.477 --> 31:52.211
No, no, I'm going to do it.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.445
Do what?

31:53.447 --> 31:55.414
Kill her husband.

32:00.420 --> 32:04.957
Ricky, you've never even killed
a spider.

32:05.458 --> 32:06.458
Oh it doesn't have to be violent
you know.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.260
I could kill him with pills or
you know,

32:08.262 --> 32:09.628
a lethal injection or
something..

32:09.630 --> 32:11.296
Lethal, lethal injection?

32:11.298 --> 32:12.531
And you have access to lethal
injection?

32:12.533 --> 32:15.634
this discussion right now.

32:16.303 --> 32:19.705
have you thought of this? What
if you get caught?!

32:20.006 --> 32:20.906
So what.

32:20.908 --> 32:22.674
So what? So what?

32:23.476 --> 32:24.910
I'm lonely and I work at a place
called Debby's.

32:25.478 --> 32:26.878
What exactly am I clinging onto
here?

32:27.714 --> 32:30.649
Ricky sit down, have a seat,
sit.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.353
I want you take six deep
breaths,

32:34.787 --> 32:36.255
in and out and go to the
bathroom and take a leak.

32:36.389 --> 32:37.289
What'll that do?

32:37.291 --> 32:38.890
I don't know, but you're talking
crazy right now.

32:38.892 --> 32:41.493
I'm not. I've never met anyone
like Danita and

32:41.495 --> 32:43.462
I'll never meet anyone like
Danita again.

32:43.696 --> 32:45.430
To think anything else would be
crazy.

32:45.665 --> 32:47.332
Okay Ricky, Ricky she's married
and,

32:47.334 --> 32:48.934
and she wants you to kill her
husband!

32:49.369 --> 32:50.936
I know. But everything else is
perfect.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.607
Look, when you meet your
soulmate and you're in your
forties,

32:55.908 --> 32:57.476
not everything is going to be
ideal.

32:57.478 --> 33:00.412
This is more than baggage!!
Alright?!

33:00.613 --> 33:02.981
Sorry, but I've made up my mind
up. I'm gonna kill this mofo.

33:03.716 --> 33:05.350
Ricky look, I want you to do me
a favor, k.

33:05.352 --> 33:06.551
I want you to go home and sleep
on it, okay?

33:06.820 --> 33:09.388
we'll talk about it tomorrow
night over donuts.

33:10.490 --> 33:11.657
There's nothing to sleep on.
Besides,

33:11.659 --> 33:13.492
I can't let that angel be a
prisoner

33:13.494 --> 33:15.060
in that monster's home anymore.

33:15.062 --> 33:16.528
I'm, I'm doing it. With or
without your help.

33:16.963 --> 33:17.963
My help?

33:17.965 --> 33:19.931
What the hell is that suppose to
mean.

33:19.933 --> 33:21.400
What do you mean by that? My
help.

33:21.402 --> 33:24.403
Well I, I just figured, you'd
help me, since you know ...

33:24.637 --> 33:26.805
You're my primo amigo too.

33:36.416 --> 33:38.984
Okay dog I'm in, but you are
gonna owe me big.

33:40.453 --> 33:41.820
Thanks for opening up my world,
Danita.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.323
I've never been to a juice bar
before.

33:44.824 --> 33:46.458
You sure it's okay to leave
work?

33:46.893 --> 33:48.060
I'm the manager.

33:48.062 --> 33:50.696
I have a lot of clout, but I try
not to let it go to my head.

33:50.698 --> 33:53.465
I thought we should talk now.
Ben's at work and--

33:53.900 --> 33:55.000
Ben?

33:55.002 --> 33:56.568
My husband.

33:56.570 --> 33:59.504
Oh. You've, you've never
actually said his name before.

34:02.375 --> 34:03.008
You okay?

34:03.010 --> 34:04.476
Yeah, yeah, of course.

34:05.511 --> 34:06.912
You don't have to do this...

34:07.113 --> 34:09.448
No, no, it was just easier when
he didn't have a name.

34:10.050 --> 34:13.051
"evil husband who will kill me
if I ever leave."

34:13.453 --> 34:14.753
I don't want you to do this.

34:14.755 --> 34:16.855
I can't believe I even asked you
to do this.

34:16.857 --> 34:18.824
I just needed to get away from
him and be with you and...

34:18.826 --> 34:20.992
It's okay, sweetheart. Please
don't be upset.

34:21.461 --> 34:22.461
I still want to kill him.

34:22.463 --> 34:23.028
Really?

34:23.030 --> 34:24.629
Yes! Very much.

34:25.531 --> 34:26.565
Oh I love you.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.100
-I love you more.
-I love you more.

34:28.968 --> 34:31.436
I love you more plus six.

34:43.049 --> 34:45.751
You knocked like a human being.

34:46.519 --> 34:47.552
Is anything wrong?

34:47.554 --> 34:49.121
There's something you need to
see, man.

34:49.123 --> 34:51.757
There's something you need to
see right now.

34:52.392 --> 34:53.825
What's that?

34:54.427 --> 34:56.027
An old movie with William Hurt
and Kathleen Turner.

34:57.430 --> 35:00.432
You know, back when she looked
like a chick.

35:01.534 --> 35:04.870
Yeah. I know, it's Body Heat. I
saw that movie.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.738
With you.

35:07.073 --> 35:09.007
Remember, neither of us could
get dates--

35:09.175 --> 35:11.910
It's time to watch it again,
bebe!

35:27.493 --> 35:30.729
Wow, wow that really holds up.

35:31.197 --> 35:35.167
You know, lots of twists, it's
compelling, it's well-written--

35:35.501 --> 35:36.802
Okay thank you, Rex Reed.

35:38.004 --> 35:39.838
She pretended to fall in love
with the guy

35:39.840 --> 35:41.907
so he would kill her husband!

35:42.209 --> 35:44.776
but I actually thought was quite
nice,

35:44.778 --> 35:46.178
as played by Richard Crenna,

35:46.180 --> 35:48.113
and then she set him up for the
murder.

35:48.482 --> 35:51.750
William Hurt trusted Kathleen
Turner!

35:52.186 --> 35:55.220
I mean she was being all crude
and mysterious

35:55.222 --> 35:59.157
there was all that saxophone
music and stuff

35:59.159 --> 36:01.560
Okay common man, you aren't the
least bit dubious, dog?

36:01.562 --> 36:03.462
Some '10' just roles into your
life,

36:03.464 --> 36:05.664
and then tells you all this
crazy shit about her evil,

36:05.666 --> 36:08.467
jealous husband, but then wait a
minute...

36:08.469 --> 36:11.470
she has a bunch of time to hang
out with you,

36:11.804 --> 36:13.104
so that's pretty weird...

36:13.239 --> 36:14.673
Well ah, he obviously works.

36:14.675 --> 36:18.944
Oh okay but wait hold on sec did
you guys, you guys..

36:18.946 --> 36:20.779
Yeah you went on a date, right?

36:20.781 --> 36:24.182
That was a night, so and then oh
you slept together which

36:24.184 --> 36:28.153
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about Ricky,

36:28.155 --> 36:31.089
Oh well, well maybe, maybe he
was working that night,

36:31.091 --> 36:32.591
or he was out of town,

36:32.593 --> 36:34.526
or he went to sleep early...

36:34.528 --> 36:38.129
you just can't stand to see me
happy, can you?

36:38.131 --> 36:41.266
No Ricky, I do not trust this
woman.

36:41.268 --> 36:43.535
Ah, ah okay. You don't trust any
woman.

36:43.537 --> 36:47.639
I don't trust some woman who
wants you to kill her husband.

36:48.107 --> 36:49.774
I trust her, completely.

36:50.142 --> 36:53.545
And I am NOT going to let your
negativity creep

36:53.547 --> 36:55.747
into my mind like a 'Trojan
Horse' virus!

36:56.983 --> 36:59.150
That's a really bad computer
virus I once got on my laptop...

36:59.552 --> 37:00.719
You hear me?!

37:05.224 --> 37:06.191
I got to talk to you!

37:06.526 --> 37:07.192
I'm working.

37:07.194 --> 37:09.928
You came to my office. During
tax season!

37:10.196 --> 37:11.696
It's the lunch rush, for god
sakes--

37:11.931 --> 37:13.532
Look I followed Danita.

37:13.534 --> 37:17.269
After you met her. I went to her
house. I, I saw her husband.

37:17.703 --> 37:18.303
Yeah?

37:18.671 --> 37:19.638
He's a rabbi.

37:21.674 --> 37:22.607
What?

37:22.609 --> 37:26.177
Her monster husband Ben is a
rabbi.

37:32.552 --> 37:33.652
How the hell do you know he's a
rabbi?

37:33.654 --> 37:35.554
Well he was wearing one of those
Jewish hats.

37:36.022 --> 37:37.656
The... the... Yamaha.

37:37.658 --> 37:39.591
He was wearing a yarmulke?

37:39.725 --> 37:40.792
That's how you know he's a
rabbi?!

37:41.227 --> 37:42.294
Okay don't talk down to me, hog.

37:42.296 --> 37:44.829
I'm not an idiot, I know what
I'm doing.

37:45.064 --> 37:46.631
I followed him. To a bookstore.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.067
Okay, you're starting to lose me
here.

37:49.235 --> 37:50.735
You didn't let me finish.

37:50.737 --> 37:54.339
I followed him to a book store.
He use to be a rabbi.

37:54.907 --> 37:57.275
Now he writes mystery novels.
About a 'crime solving Rabbi.'

37:58.311 --> 37:59.644
He was doing a book signing.

37:59.646 --> 38:03.281
Her evil husband is a mystery
novel writing former rabbi?

38:04.584 --> 38:05.584
Yeah. I even read one of his
books.

38:05.586 --> 38:08.620
In one sitting. I couldn't put
it down.

38:08.888 --> 38:10.722
I, I can't believe a retired
rabbi

38:11.223 --> 38:13.058
has gotten his books published
and I--

38:13.359 --> 38:15.360
Look, this doesn't change
anything, you know.

38:15.728 --> 38:16.761
He could still be a monster.

38:16.763 --> 38:19.297
You know authors can be
egotistical pricks and,

38:19.765 --> 38:22.767
and a lot of clergymen are, are
evil molesters.

38:23.002 --> 38:24.269
No,no, hold on a second, no no.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.037
There aren't any molesting
rabbis.

38:26.238 --> 38:27.606
Only priests do that.

38:27.608 --> 38:30.609
Yeah, yeah, you know maybe all
this makes more sense now.

38:30.910 --> 38:32.110
Yeah!

38:32.112 --> 38:33.612
She said that, that he was this
"great man"

38:33.614 --> 38:37.282
to embarrass him and now we see
that he's this...

38:37.284 --> 38:40.986
'published' author, this evil,

38:40.988 --> 38:45.290
monstrous wife-threatening
published author--

38:46.826 --> 38:51.062
Or, or he's just a nice guy like
Richy Crenna in Body Heat.

38:51.263 --> 38:54.366
Just a nice, loaded guy who she
wants you to kill

38:54.734 --> 38:56.167
so she can get all his money and

38:56.402 --> 38:58.136
make you take the rap, Ricky.

39:10.983 --> 39:11.750
This is stupid.

39:11.752 --> 39:14.119
No, it isn't k. We have to know
if this guy's Hitler.

39:14.121 --> 39:16.187
We can tell if he's Hitler from
a book signing?

39:16.189 --> 39:18.957
I can. I can read people. I'm an
accountant.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.393
You know it's probably not a
good idea for you to be here.

39:21.827 --> 39:24.129
He can't see you, in you're the
guy pulling the trigger.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.297
I, I haven't decided I'm going
to shoot him.

39:26.699 --> 39:28.700
Shoot him, poison him, trip him,
whatever you want to do.

39:28.934 --> 39:29.401
Trip him?

39:29.403 --> 39:31.302
Yeah I don't know. Down a flight
of stairs or something.

39:31.304 --> 39:32.804
You can't talk about this in
public.

39:32.806 --> 39:35.006
What are you doing? Ricky what
are you doing?

39:35.008 --> 39:37.409
You're right, right good call,
good call.

39:47.820 --> 39:48.887
Hey, Mr. Jacobs.

39:49.155 --> 39:50.855
Oh please, call me Ben.

39:51.457 --> 39:53.792
Um, okay... Ben.

39:54.260 --> 39:55.927
Yeah, any fan of mine is also a
friend.

39:56.996 --> 39:58.730
That's... a pretty cool way of
looking at things.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.098
Well seriously I wouldn't be
anywhere

40:00.100 --> 40:01.366
without my loyal readers.

40:01.801 --> 40:07.205
Right, right. I guess you
wouldn't...

40:10.042 --> 40:12.243
Do you think it's okay to kill a
woman if she leaves you?

40:12.712 --> 40:14.112
What? No!

40:14.714 --> 40:15.780
No, no...

40:15.782 --> 40:17.115
Why would you ask such a
question?

40:17.117 --> 40:18.416
I don't know. Just making small
talk.

40:18.418 --> 40:20.919
You please sign this. Make it
out to "Seth?"

40:20.921 --> 40:22.987
Yeah...

40:24.090 --> 40:25.156
There you go, man.

40:26.826 --> 40:28.326
We still don't know he's not
Hitler.

40:28.328 --> 40:30.328
Hitler doesn't sign books with a
smiley face.

40:30.930 --> 40:32.297
Well, what did you expect him to
do,

40:32.299 --> 40:35.400
foam at the mouth and rotate his
head 360 degrees?

40:35.836 --> 40:40.338
to kill a woman if she's left
him, he was against it, so...

40:40.340 --> 40:42.340
He's obviously not gonna admit
that he's okay...--

40:42.342 --> 40:44.442
Look, Ricky she's already lied
to you once.

40:44.444 --> 40:46.211
How do you know she's not lying
about this too?

40:46.213 --> 40:48.146
I don't think she'd lie to me
twice.

40:51.450 --> 40:54.052
If, if I could just see them
together, I'd know.

40:55.488 --> 40:56.955
You see now that's a good idea.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.156
We'll just plant the camera in
their house!

40:58.457 --> 40:59.424
You know how to do that?

40:59.426 --> 41:01.993
But you know I once saw this
show once

41:02.262 --> 41:04.963
Oh my god the bitch shaking the
baby,

41:04.965 --> 41:06.331
stealing money, it was complete
disaster.

41:06.333 --> 41:07.899
We'll just break into her house
and set one up.

41:08.267 --> 41:10.034
You, you know how to break into
somebody's home?

41:10.036 --> 41:13.404
You know, it's easy to piss on
every plan.

41:19.478 --> 41:20.478
I'm, I'm sorry...?

41:20.480 --> 41:21.346
Thank you!

41:21.814 --> 41:22.947
You sure they come here?

41:26.819 --> 41:28.353
The guy is a millionaire and he
takes her to "Olive Garden?"

41:29.256 --> 41:32.557
This ain't Olive Garden, hog.
It's Pimento Garden.

41:33.159 --> 41:34.259
How do they get away with that?

41:34.261 --> 41:35.326
I dunno.

41:35.328 --> 41:36.928
Okay great, looks like they're
not here yet.

41:36.930 --> 41:38.530
You remember the plan right?

41:38.532 --> 41:42.867
Don't, don't, look it's a good
plan okay!

41:42.869 --> 41:44.469
You can make anything sound
ridiculous by 'shorthanding' it.

41:44.471 --> 41:46.304
-Let's just go. -No, no, no,
noway amigo!

41:46.306 --> 41:47.939
Look we go to make sure that
she's not a femme 'fatal'

41:47.941 --> 41:48.907
like Kathleen Turner.

41:48.909 --> 41:51.442
It's femme fatale and she is NOT
like Kathleen Turner!

41:51.444 --> 41:52.544
Oh whatever, Sharon Stone or
Denise Richards

41:53.012 --> 41:53.545
whatever you want...

41:53.547 --> 41:54.279
Denise Richards?

41:54.281 --> 41:56.815
-I don't remember that movie.
-You never saw Wild Things?

41:56.817 --> 42:00.418
It was a classic, no?

42:00.420 --> 42:02.987
Hey! How are you?

42:03.522 --> 42:05.423
Hi... it's Seth, right?

42:05.959 --> 42:08.426
Honey, this guy just came to a
book signing.

42:09.295 --> 42:10.895
I never forget the face of a
fan.

42:11.463 --> 42:12.397
How you doin'?

42:12.399 --> 42:15.900
Wow, I can't, can't believe a
big-time author like you

42:15.902 --> 42:19.470
what a small world, it's, it's a
small world

42:19.472 --> 42:20.839
Isn't it, Ricky?

42:21.373 --> 42:23.274
It's very small, it's very
small.

42:23.276 --> 42:27.545
Okay well, it was really great
running into you , Ben,

42:28.180 --> 42:29.447
we'll just let you get back to
having dinner in private

42:30.216 --> 42:31.115
with your wife so bye bye.

42:31.117 --> 42:33.351
Wai, wai, wait. Nonsense.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.287
-Why don't you two join us?
-Pardon?

42:36.289 --> 42:38.122
Well it's not every day an
author gets to converse

42:38.524 --> 42:39.924
with one of his fans.

42:39.926 --> 42:42.927
And besides you deserve a free
meal just for reading my books.

42:43.462 --> 42:47.098
So what do you say, alright?
Great, common.

42:49.268 --> 42:52.604
Good times...

42:55.074 --> 42:56.441
Okay, okay, okay.

42:56.443 --> 42:59.143
So Seth, tell me what is it you
like best about my books?

42:59.378 --> 43:00.411
And please.

43:00.413 --> 43:04.382
Don't spare a single detail.
Unless of course it's negative.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.218
Well, I like everything about
them.

43:07.620 --> 43:10.288
The suspense, the surprise
twists, the characters... ya I,

43:10.290 --> 43:13.458
I love how the killer is always
the most unlikely, unassuming
guy and--

43:13.893 --> 43:15.360
Were you born in L.A?

43:15.362 --> 43:16.361
Huh?

43:16.363 --> 43:19.330
Uh, were, were you born in...

43:19.332 --> 43:21.299
'Los An-gull-ese?'

43:22.034 --> 43:23.368
Uh... was anybody?

43:24.303 --> 43:25.670
Right...?

43:26.438 --> 43:29.107
Well I was and Seth too.

43:29.109 --> 43:32.644
Well, not Los Angeles, persay,
but Sherman Oaks.

43:33.445 --> 43:35.380
I'm from Pittsburgh originally.

43:37.182 --> 43:40.184
know I, I first met Danita at a
Pimento Garden,

43:40.586 --> 43:42.487
she was a waitress there and

43:43.088 --> 43:45.423
I proposed to her on a Saturday
night and

43:45.925 --> 43:49.460
we've been coming back to one
every Saturday since.

43:50.095 --> 43:52.130
No matter where we've lived.

43:53.966 --> 43:55.066
Awww

43:55.200 --> 43:57.035
I didn't know that.

43:57.303 --> 43:59.637
I mean, why, why, why would he
know,

44:00.306 --> 44:02.106
why, why, why would he know...
why,

44:02.374 --> 44:04.375
why that mean, it's very
romantic, it's very romantic...

44:04.510 --> 44:06.444
Isn't it romantic, Ricky?

44:06.446 --> 44:08.446
It's...Very romantic.

44:08.981 --> 44:11.349
You, have been awfully quiet
tonight, honey.

44:13.285 --> 44:15.219
No, no, no I'm just listening.

44:15.454 --> 44:16.988
Well, you can talk too.

44:16.990 --> 44:18.356
I mean it's allowed.

44:18.657 --> 44:19.590
Thanks.

44:20.359 --> 44:22.093
Hell, I'm a modern man.

44:22.394 --> 44:23.628
Yes, that you are.

44:24.296 --> 44:26.698
Modern enough to give his
beautiful wife

44:27.199 --> 44:28.433
a little kiss in public.

44:29.068 --> 44:30.468
Let's order.

44:31.370 --> 44:33.571
Sorry, me hungry like a
'sumbitch.

44:42.214 --> 44:43.982
Uhg..., that was great.

44:44.283 --> 44:46.150
Benny you sure me and Ricky
can't kick in

44:46.152 --> 44:47.418
at least for the Cherry Pepsi?

44:47.420 --> 44:49.487
Out of the question. My treat,
please.

44:51.123 --> 44:52.390
There ya go, thanks

44:52.992 --> 44:54.625
Wow. What a nice guy.

44:55.728 --> 44:58.596
Ya, I guess it's nice being a
millionaire writer,

44:59.264 --> 45:00.465
never having to worry about
money.

45:00.467 --> 45:02.700
Oh well, it wasn't always like
that, believe me.

45:02.702 --> 45:05.570
I mean, it took me years and
years to make it as a writer

45:06.372 --> 45:08.473
Wow, see, Ricky. I told you!
It's never too late.

45:08.774 --> 45:10.375
Ricky wrote this really cool
book and then he just quit.

45:11.310 --> 45:12.543
Aww. That's a shame.

45:13.345 --> 45:15.313
I, I didn't write a book and I
didn't quit.

45:16.048 --> 45:18.449
I just got, you know... eighty
pages into one,

45:19.118 --> 45:22.053
a long time ago, and then I got
a real job so...

45:22.654 --> 45:24.155
Well, I love to read it.

45:28.093 --> 45:28.659
Excuse me?

45:28.661 --> 45:31.095
I'd love to read your eighty
pages Ricky.

45:32.364 --> 45:33.798
Here, I'll give you my card.

45:34.633 --> 45:36.634
You can send it over and give me
a call in few days and

45:36.636 --> 45:38.102
I'll give you some feedback.

45:40.072 --> 45:42.140
Go on take it, it's okay.

45:47.046 --> 45:48.780
I can't believe the man I'm
supposed to kill

45:49.581 --> 45:51.049
is going to read my work.

45:51.650 --> 45:52.750
I knew she was lying.

45:53.452 --> 45:54.452
We still don't know that.

45:54.754 --> 45:59.123
And she did seem uncomfortable
around him.

45:59.391 --> 46:00.391
What are you talking about?

46:00.393 --> 46:03.261
When he tried to kiss her, she
was uncomfortable, but he kept
going.

46:03.263 --> 46:04.395
He practically tongue-raped her.

46:04.663 --> 46:05.596
Oh, whatever--

46:08.734 --> 46:11.469
Oh ya. I forgot to tell you. I
met a woman on E-Happily too.

46:11.770 --> 46:14.405
Yeah, she's actually hot, at
least her picture is, but...

46:15.074 --> 46:17.608
oh umm, and if we ever do go on
a date and

46:18.110 --> 46:19.710
by chance you happen run into
us,

46:20.345 --> 46:23.448
she sort of thinks I am an
astronaut.

46:34.393 --> 46:35.159
Hello...

46:35.161 --> 46:37.662
Hi, honey. God, I'm still
shaking.

46:38.831 --> 46:40.498
I, I can't believe we ran into
each other like that--

46:40.866 --> 46:43.101
It is a small world.

46:43.469 --> 46:45.403
You handled yourself great,
though.

46:45.604 --> 46:50.641
Calm, poised, sort of, I hope I
did too.

46:51.543 --> 46:52.777
Where is he?

46:53.178 --> 46:54.645
He's downstairs, I can just talk
for a minute,

46:56.282 --> 47:00.718
I wanted to die, him pawing at
me and kissing me like that.

47:02.154 --> 47:03.688
I just needed to hear your
voice.

47:04.656 --> 47:06.424
Umm, Umm, I'm glad you called.

47:09.394 --> 47:12.763
Boy, he really didn't seem like
the monster I imagined.

47:13.298 --> 47:15.399
Nooo, he's good at fooling
people.

47:15.401 --> 47:18.803
Yeah Really good at it. I mean,
generous, affable...

47:21.573 --> 47:22.840
He almost fooled me.

47:24.409 --> 47:26.310
Do you think I'm lying to you,
Ricky?

47:26.512 --> 47:31.315
No, no, it, it... I mean it's
just, a little odd.

47:33.352 --> 47:37.321
You told me he's this evil guy
who threatened to kill you

47:37.589 --> 47:38.789
and he used to be a rabbi--

47:39.191 --> 47:40.391
How did you know that?

47:42.928 --> 47:44.929
Huh? Seth told me.

47:45.397 --> 47:48.166
He Googled him and checked his
website and--

47:48.500 --> 47:51.736
You didn't just run into us
tonight, did you?

47:52.538 --> 47:54.372
You knew we were going to be
there.

47:54.374 --> 48:00.278
No, no. Okay, yeah, uh but you
know Seth just wanted

48:00.812 --> 48:02.547
to make sure you weren't using
me or,

48:02.549 --> 48:04.282
or trying to set me up--

48:04.450 --> 48:08.753
Yeah, yeah of course. I, I trust
you, Danita.

48:09.688 --> 48:11.622
Totally. I always have.

48:12.391 --> 48:13.424
Goodbye, Ricky.

48:28.440 --> 48:28.973
Hey, hog.

48:28.975 --> 48:31.209
What are you doing here?

48:31.410 --> 48:32.476
I'm meeting my E-Happily chick.

48:32.478 --> 48:36.380
Hey look, I was wondering if you
can do me a solid,

48:36.382 --> 48:37.615
maybe come over and break things
up

48:37.617 --> 48:38.950
if she doesn't look like her
picture.

48:39.484 --> 48:41.719
Oh, you know what you can do?

48:42.354 --> 48:44.255
Say my Mom just died and I'm
needed at the cemetery--

48:44.257 --> 48:45.590
No.

48:45.592 --> 48:47.458
Hey! I'm helping you kill a guy.

48:49.294 --> 48:50.428
Sorry. I should probably lower
my voice.

48:50.430 --> 48:53.564
That's, that's not happening
anymore.

48:53.566 --> 48:54.599
What?

48:54.601 --> 48:55.633
Danita's pissed at me.

48:55.635 --> 48:57.501
She thought I didn't just run
into her the other night.

48:57.503 --> 48:59.837
She thought I went there because
I didn't trust her.

49:01.341 --> 49:04.976
I don't, I don't want to pick
sides, the girl is right,

49:05.511 --> 49:07.945
Because YOU put all that thought
in my head!

49:08.381 --> 49:11.882
It's easy to be a Monday morning
quarterback and

49:11.884 --> 49:13.517
blame it all on me, but...

49:14.387 --> 49:19.724
That's her! She IS her picture,
wish me luck, dog.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.793
Snail.

49:23.663 --> 49:27.398
could you come by our table and
ask me something 'astronaut-y.'

49:40.512 --> 49:41.445
Hello, Seth.

49:47.019 --> 49:49.520
Um, maybe we should get a table?

49:50.322 --> 49:54.058
Yes! Oh yes, of course, yes. I
have a lot of pull here.

49:54.459 --> 49:55.793
So Garcon.

49:56.662 --> 49:57.995
That is French.

49:57.997 --> 50:00.398
And why wouldn't you know that?
I'm a moron.

50:00.532 --> 50:06.437
Relax, tonight you're going to
get paid and laid.

50:07.306 --> 50:09.440
Oh, no, no, no, no.

50:09.908 --> 50:12.510
It was a phrase I took from your
profile.

50:13.045 --> 50:14.445
I thought it was very funny.

50:14.447 --> 50:17.948
Oh, oh right! I see! Ah shit I
thought you were serious.

50:18.617 --> 50:21.385
Pardon my French. And I
apologize for that.

50:21.387 --> 50:23.554
I didn't mean to imply that
French is course,

50:23.556 --> 50:26.424
or, or that it is obscene or
that it is a gutter language.

50:26.426 --> 50:28.559
French is not a gutter language

50:45.410 --> 50:47.478
All my life, I had been looking
for my prince.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.815
Danita, I, I, I need to talk to
you, please call me back--

50:53.619 --> 50:55.519
Look I'm sorry I didn't trust
you,

50:55.787 --> 50:56.987
but Seth kept making me watch
"Body Heat" and

50:56.989 --> 50:58.122
and "Wild Things"--

51:00.493 --> 51:01.525
Jesus, Seth!

51:13.739 --> 51:14.472
Talk to me.

51:14.474 --> 51:16.474
Look, look, it's my fault k.

51:16.641 --> 51:18.376
Seth got into my head and

51:18.378 --> 51:20.544
I started obsessing and getting
all suspicious, but,

51:20.546 --> 51:21.645
but that's no excuse

51:21.647 --> 51:23.381
I was using you.

51:25.117 --> 51:26.417
What...

51:26.419 --> 51:28.619
At first.

51:28.621 --> 51:30.688
I've told you the truth about my
husband.

51:30.690 --> 51:33.557
He would kill me if I tried to
leave him.

51:33.559 --> 51:35.593
He controls every dime of mine

51:35.595 --> 51:39.563
so I could never pay to have
somone... one day,

51:39.898 --> 51:42.566
I went on a dating service to
look for someone desperate.

51:42.568 --> 51:44.402
And they just...matched me up
with you.

51:46.138 --> 51:49.673
I, I, I figured that any man
willing to go on a date

51:49.675 --> 51:51.475
with a woman without even seeing
her picture,

51:51.477 --> 51:54.478
might be willing to go along
with just about anything.

51:54.947 --> 52:01.085
No but then I met you and it
just... everything changed.

52:01.420 --> 52:04.021
I just... fell in love with
you.

52:05.924 --> 52:07.024
Uh-huh...

52:07.026 --> 52:10.928
I did, Ricky, I did. I, I really
did. I'll be honest.

52:11.430 --> 52:12.897
At first when I read your
profile,

52:13.598 --> 52:16.066
I couldn't believe anyone that
sweet could actually exist.

52:16.535 --> 52:19.170
I mean I even snickered when I
read the word "heart-ner" the
first time...

52:21.606 --> 52:22.206
then I met you and...

52:22.208 --> 52:24.809
you were just... you are that
sweet in person and ...

52:24.811 --> 52:27.144
I love you,

52:27.546 --> 52:29.814
I love you from the bottom of my
heart, Ricky.

52:31.149 --> 52:32.850
And I, I know you have no reason
to believe me, but I-

52:32.852 --> 52:35.553
Goodbye, Danita.

52:37.722 --> 52:40.691
Yeah okay, I guess that's what I
deserve.

52:42.828 --> 52:46.864
Goodbye, Ricky. I'm so sorry,
Ricky.

52:48.500 --> 52:51.068
You're my soulmate and I screwed
it all up.

52:56.241 --> 52:57.508
Swear on Albert Brooks.

52:58.543 --> 52:59.109
What?

53:00.512 --> 53:03.013
Swear on Albert Brooks that you
love me.

53:04.583 --> 53:05.916
If you're lying, he'll be struck
dead.

53:07.686 --> 53:10.187
And also one of your cats.

53:13.091 --> 53:14.124
I swear.

53:14.126 --> 53:17.261
I swear on Albert Brooks and
Chairman Meow.

53:17.263 --> 53:22.032
I love you, I love you Ricky.
With all my heart.

53:23.201 --> 53:24.668
Oh God. I love you too, Danita!

53:27.072 --> 53:29.807
Um listen, uh...there's
something

53:32.511 --> 53:33.878
I probably should have told you.

53:36.615 --> 53:39.149
Um well it's something you've
probably noticed already.

53:40.986 --> 53:42.953
My...whole head was a lie.

53:44.523 --> 53:47.958
It's okay, you look more
beautiful without your makeup.

53:58.637 --> 53:59.236
It's back on.

53:59.604 --> 54:00.070
What?

54:00.072 --> 54:01.539
"Operation Kill The Rabbi."

54:01.940 --> 54:02.806
It's a go

54:03.742 --> 54:04.308
Pound it.

54:08.847 --> 54:11.615
What, what exactly... is our
"Operation?"

54:11.617 --> 54:12.883
You know what, I don't know.

54:13.084 --> 54:13.984
I was thinking shoot him, trip
him?

54:13.986 --> 54:15.219
Right now is not a good time,
bebe.

54:15.221 --> 54:16.787
Up to my ass in "1099's. Okay.

54:24.563 --> 54:26.664
You want me to give your husband
my novel?

54:27.232 --> 54:29.033
Yes. Just like he asked.

54:30.569 --> 54:32.336
Then you can come over one night
to... discuss it,

54:32.938 --> 54:35.139
face to face, where you can
absorb all his comments and

54:36.207 --> 54:38.609
then you'll have the perfect
opportunity-

54:39.210 --> 54:40.311
I'm not sure it's ready.

54:41.313 --> 54:42.112
What?

54:42.614 --> 54:43.247
The eighty pages.

54:43.249 --> 54:45.983
You know, I haven't even proofed
it yet and--

54:45.985 --> 54:48.352
You're not sending it to him so
he'll give it to his agent!

54:48.354 --> 54:52.289
You're giving it to him so you
can get invited

54:52.657 --> 54:54.692
into his home and kill him.

54:54.960 --> 54:56.660
It's just, it's been a real long
time

54:57.028 --> 54:59.129
since anyone's read my stuff and
I...

55:00.599 --> 55:02.166
Sorry, I'm reaally nervous.

55:04.002 --> 55:05.102
Me too, honey.

55:07.339 --> 55:08.739
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

55:08.741 --> 55:12.743
Maybe we can just get in your
car and drive away,

55:13.311 --> 55:15.245
far away, you and me, right now.

55:16.247 --> 55:18.182
I'd have to give Debby's two
weeks notice.

55:18.383 --> 55:22.653
Sorry, I was sure you were
kidding.

55:24.889 --> 55:26.256
Let's just get away.

55:27.292 --> 55:29.627
Maybe he won't kill me like he
says he will.

55:30.128 --> 55:31.695
Yeah, okay, he's killed before,
but...

55:34.099 --> 55:36.100
Oh yeah he killed his first
wife.

55:37.369 --> 55:39.370
And they couldn't prove it, but
he did.

55:39.372 --> 55:43.140
The prick even made it into the
plot of his first, first book.

55:44.376 --> 55:49.346
Genius murderer gets away with
killing a cheating wife.

55:50.115 --> 55:51.148
Christ...

55:51.349 --> 55:52.349
His family warned me.

55:52.351 --> 55:56.086
Till the day I married him, it's
just I never listened.

55:56.288 --> 56:03.394
No, no, no hey, at least you
have good taste in men now.

56:09.167 --> 56:15.139
"How to buy a gun..." Oh Shit.

56:16.041 --> 56:17.374
They can trace Google searches,
idiot!

56:19.310 --> 56:23.113
Uh, uh, smiley face? "LOL"--

56:23.281 --> 56:24.415
Hey, man, can I talk to you for
a second?

56:25.450 --> 56:27.284
Sure. What up, dog?

56:28.453 --> 56:30.387
I'm gonna need some more time
off.

56:30.789 --> 56:32.289
Yeah, okay, 'whatev's.'

56:35.393 --> 56:39.363
Oh, hey, you know, Jorge there's
something I,

56:39.365 --> 56:40.731
I always wanted to ask you.

56:41.332 --> 56:43.801
Um do you know anybody who sells
guns?

56:44.869 --> 56:45.903
Excuse me?

56:47.072 --> 56:48.472
Oh well, it's for my...father.

56:48.474 --> 56:52.342
He likes to hunt deer... I, I
don't condone it, but you know,

56:53.344 --> 56:55.913
gives him pleasure and his
birthday is coming up so...

56:56.181 --> 56:58.482
Why would you think I would know
somebody who sells guns, huh?

56:58.883 --> 57:00.017
'Cause I'm Hispanic?

57:00.385 --> 57:01.719
No, no, of course not.

57:02.387 --> 57:03.420
I, I didn't mean anything.
Honestly--

57:03.923 --> 57:07.891
it's just that this is how
stereotypes get perpetuated
and--

57:07.893 --> 57:09.860
Couldn't agree more and I'm
sorry I asked.

57:14.399 --> 57:16.133
You know what? I just
remembered.

57:16.401 --> 57:17.968
My brother and sister sell guns.

57:22.741 --> 57:24.274
This is stupid... shouldn't we
be at a,

57:24.276 --> 57:25.442
a shooting range or something.

57:25.777 --> 57:27.377
Witnesses, dog.

57:27.379 --> 57:28.412
Use your head, k.

57:28.414 --> 57:29.747
It's totally discreet here.

57:37.522 --> 57:40.491
Ah! Ah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, that
was discreet.

57:41.326 --> 57:42.793
Couldn't you have asked the
busboy

57:42.961 --> 57:43.360
for a silencer or something?

57:43.362 --> 57:46.029
Sorry, first gun, forgot to ask
for accessories.

57:46.031 --> 57:48.432
Alright, you know what, I'll
show you how to do it, hog.

57:48.933 --> 57:50.234
You got to.., aim the, aim the.

57:50.236 --> 57:52.503
Now don't hold the trigger yet,
no, no don't hold...

57:52.505 --> 57:55.172
what are you a gangster...
Put it straight up, okay,

57:55.174 --> 57:58.342
now make sure your forearm needs
to be in line with the barrel.

57:58.910 --> 58:00.410
Needs to be in line...
no straight,

58:00.845 --> 58:02.946
don't turn your elbow in or else
you're going to loop.

58:03.148 --> 58:04.281
This is going to dislocate
immediately.

58:04.283 --> 58:07.818
Okay look, no, no, no, you got
to stay, you got to stay square.

58:08.353 --> 58:09.553
Okay you have no power there.

58:09.555 --> 58:12.422
Look at it through that eye.
The eye closest to the, to the.

58:13.358 --> 58:14.892
You know what, you don't have to
shoot him.

58:15.260 --> 58:16.560
No, no, no. I want to shoot him.

58:17.162 --> 58:18.495
That's how this murderer
deserves to die.

58:19.364 --> 58:20.097
Murderer?

58:20.099 --> 58:22.366
Well yeah, he killed his first
wife, totally got away with it.

58:22.368 --> 58:24.434
No, no, no, I think you're
thinking of Ben's first book,

58:24.436 --> 58:25.936
which is a great read by the
way.

58:25.938 --> 58:27.137
I highly recommend it.

58:27.139 --> 58:29.306
No, no, Danita told me he did
that.

58:29.308 --> 58:30.407
In real life.

58:30.409 --> 58:33.243
How do you know she's telling
the truth now?

58:34.379 --> 58:35.379
I looked into her eyes.

58:37.115 --> 58:39.416
Oh, good, great, I feel really
good about this now.

58:40.418 --> 58:42.820
Did you at least think to Google
the guy

58:43.121 --> 58:44.521
to see if he even HAD a first
wife?

58:45.123 --> 58:47.257
Okay, okay. You know what your
problem is?

58:47.559 --> 58:50.894
Seriously, seriously you know, I
think you need to hear it.

58:51.029 --> 58:52.329
This may hurt you but I...

58:52.331 --> 58:53.564
I really think you need to hear
it.

58:54.098 --> 58:55.465
Okay Dr. Phil, what's my
problem?

58:56.000 --> 58:58.969
Okay, you are so emotionally
immature,

58:59.304 --> 59:02.339
so afraid of any kind of serious
relationship that

59:02.341 --> 59:05.843
you mistrust every woman so you
don't have to make a commitment.

59:07.345 --> 59:08.412
I see...

59:08.947 --> 59:10.547
Yeah, I mean, I'm your best
friend,

59:11.182 --> 59:13.016
so I really felt like I had to
say it.

59:13.484 --> 59:14.151
Really?

59:15.087 --> 59:18.422
Then why did I propose to Tracey
at the end of our first date?

59:19.391 --> 59:22.392
I was going to surprise you with
the news.

59:23.428 --> 59:25.262
Tonight. Over a hot dog and
soup.

59:25.463 --> 59:27.364
But nooo you had to ruin it by
saying

59:27.366 --> 59:29.399
all those hurtful, hurtful,
hurt...

59:30.069 --> 59:34.504
Yeah, I dunno, I guess I was hit
by lightning too, dog.

59:35.306 --> 59:37.441
I mean... she's attractive and
she said I was her type--

59:37.443 --> 59:39.376
and nobody ever tells me I'm
their type --

59:39.944 --> 59:41.411
so the words "will you marry
me",

59:42.380 --> 59:44.915
I dunno they just kinda of
slipped out of my mouth,

59:44.917 --> 59:47.050
like 'sappy Tourette's' or
something like that.

59:47.385 --> 59:48.919
And. what did she say?

59:48.921 --> 59:51.521
Yes! She said yes! We're getting
married in a month.

59:51.523 --> 59:56.927
Wow, wow, that is unbeliev....
I'm, I'm proud of you, man.

59:59.097 --> 1:00:01.398
Thank you Ricky, me too.

1:00:03.001 --> 1:00:04.501
Actually I told her I wasn't an
astronaut

1:00:04.669 --> 1:00:07.104
about a half hour after I popped
the question.

1:00:07.338 --> 1:00:08.505
She was a little weirded out by
that,

1:00:08.507 --> 1:00:10.474
but she didn't retract her "yes"
and--

1:00:11.577 --> 1:00:14.077
No, no, no, I'm happy for you.
It's just...

1:00:14.079 --> 1:00:18.115
now I'm the LAST guy from high
school to never be married.

1:00:23.121 --> 1:00:25.122
Ricky, you got to keep your arm
in line with the barrel!

1:00:43.341 --> 1:00:50.247
Ben Jacobs,author, first wife

1:00:59.390 --> 1:01:00.590
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you,
Danita.

1:01:01.192 --> 1:01:02.359
I'll never use Google again.

1:01:14.572 --> 1:01:15.439
Hello...

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:16.506
Mr. Jacobs.

1:01:16.508 --> 1:01:19.643
It's, it's Ricky. You know, the,
the 80-page writer.

1:01:20.144 --> 1:01:21.345
Ricky! Hey!

1:01:21.347 --> 1:01:25.115
Oh... yeah... I hope I'm not
bothering you, but I,

1:01:25.283 --> 1:01:27.551
I just wanted to let you know
that I just messengered you my
book--

1:01:28.019 --> 1:01:30.520
Oh excellent. Well I'm really
looking forward to reading it.

1:01:31.189 --> 1:01:32.522
Listen, uh, uh after you read
it,

1:01:33.157 --> 1:01:36.159
I'd love to talk to you, uh, uh,
face to face,

1:01:36.461 --> 1:01:39.629
so I can absorb all your
comments, you know, so, uh--

1:01:39.764 --> 1:01:41.264
Why don't you come over for
dinner?

1:01:43.401 --> 1:01:48.472
That's... just what I was about
to ask you. Um, I mean,

1:01:49.107 --> 1:01:50.407
I hope it's not too much
trouble.

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:52.642
No, no, trouble at all.

1:01:52.644 --> 1:01:53.710
How's Sunday?

1:01:54.078 --> 1:01:55.145
Thanks bye.

1:02:08.393 --> 1:02:11.428
Oh, I just got off the phone
with Ricky and

1:02:11.430 --> 1:02:13.463
he's coming over for dinner
Sunday night.

1:02:15.466 --> 1:02:16.299
Ricky?

1:02:16.301 --> 1:02:19.536
Yeah, I'm... reading his book,
honey, remember.

1:02:20.605 --> 1:02:22.639
Oh yeah, right... yeah

1:02:24.709 --> 1:02:27.044
Is it okay with you that I
invited him to dinner?

1:02:27.612 --> 1:02:28.745
Of course.

1:02:29.213 --> 1:02:33.250
Okay good.

1:02:53.438 --> 1:02:54.204
Hi, baby.

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:56.640
What's wrong?

1:02:56.642 --> 1:02:58.275
I think Ben may know about us.

1:02:58.409 --> 1:02:59.609
Christ!

1:03:00.311 --> 1:03:01.411
Sorry.

1:03:03.514 --> 1:03:04.448
No. Why?!

1:03:04.450 --> 1:03:07.284
Cause, might, you know, he may
try and kill me first.

1:03:08.086 --> 1:03:09.086
Oh, right.

1:03:09.587 --> 1:03:10.821
Hey.

1:03:11.289 --> 1:03:12.522
No, what am I saying?

1:03:12.524 --> 1:03:15.192
He'd never kill you in his own
house. He'd take you somewhere
else.

1:03:15.194 --> 1:03:17.494
How do we know he doesn't have
after-dinner plans?

1:03:17.496 --> 1:03:22.165
Ah... I bet he was just trying
to scare me. You know what,

1:03:22.333 --> 1:03:24.468
if he really thought we were
having an affair, you'd be dead
already.

1:03:25.570 --> 1:03:26.470
Oh...key-doke.

1:03:28.239 --> 1:03:29.306
I love you, Ricky.

1:03:30.241 --> 1:03:31.775
I love you more, plus seven.

1:03:34.545 --> 1:03:37.514
Oh, after dinner, he'll take you
up to his office to discuss your
book,

1:03:38.349 --> 1:03:40.283
so as soon as he walks up the
first few steps,

1:03:40.551 --> 1:03:42.285
just shoot him twice in the back
of the head.

1:03:43.154 --> 1:03:45.122
Oh, I should probably make sure
he gets up first.

1:03:45.124 --> 1:03:48.325
Cause otherwise, if I walked in
front of him,

1:03:48.327 --> 1:03:50.460
I'm going to have to reach
around him to get access to the
back of his head

1:03:50.462 --> 1:03:52.262
I'm... sorry, I'm rambling.

1:03:52.264 --> 1:03:53.330
You'll do great.

1:03:53.332 --> 1:03:55.765
Thank you, baby.

1:03:55.767 --> 1:04:00.504
Please stop staring at me Jesus.

1:04:12.383 --> 1:04:13.150
K, cool.

1:04:13.152 --> 1:04:15.218
You can't barely see your face.

1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:16.520
Why you wearing a Minnesota cap?

1:04:17.855 --> 1:04:20.524
Oh, it's, it's a Montreal Royals
cap.

1:04:20.526 --> 1:04:22.659
It's, it's the first minor
league team Jackie Robinson
played for,

1:04:22.661 --> 1:04:23.827
I mean you saw that movie?

1:04:23.829 --> 1:04:27.464
Harrison Ford and Chadwick
Boseman, it was really, it was a
were superb.

1:04:27.598 --> 1:04:29.833
And, and a delightful turn by
John C. McGinley--

1:04:30.535 --> 1:04:32.502
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just
relax, okay?.

1:04:33.505 --> 1:04:37.374
all you have to do is kill a guy
while his back is turned.

1:04:37.675 --> 1:04:39.309
Okay and don't forget,

1:04:39.544 --> 1:04:41.478
the barrel of the gun should be
in line with your forearm-

1:04:42.313 --> 1:04:44.548
Oh will shut up with that
alright!

1:04:45.316 --> 1:04:46.416
Trying to help, Ricky.

1:04:50.421 --> 1:04:51.588
I'm sorry I yelled, man.

1:04:54.492 --> 1:04:57.694
Yeah, well, I mean I guess you
got a lot on your plate.

1:05:01.566 --> 1:05:05.468
Look um, when the deed is down
just text me...

1:05:05.836 --> 1:05:07.904
"the rabbi sleeps with the
gefilta fishes",

1:05:08.639 --> 1:05:10.540
I'll help you guys dump the
body, okay?

1:05:12.410 --> 1:05:14.477
You're a primo amigo plus, man.
You know that?

1:05:26.891 --> 1:05:27.557
I gotta...

1:05:29.327 --> 1:05:30.327
You got to go.

1:05:30.795 --> 1:05:32.696
Yeah I got...

1:05:35.466 --> 1:05:37.234
You got, you got.

1:06:10.935 --> 1:06:13.503
It's okay honey, you keep on
writing. I'll get the door.

1:06:16.641 --> 1:06:17.474
How you doing?

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:18.875
Okay. I think.

1:06:19.777 --> 1:06:20.844
Hello, Ricky.

1:06:21.045 --> 1:06:22.412
Welcome to our house.

1:06:22.613 --> 1:06:24.481
Ben will be out in a minute.

1:06:25.583 --> 1:06:26.750
You really do have cats. I love
you.

1:06:27.451 --> 1:06:28.451
I love you.

1:06:28.919 --> 1:06:30.954
Ricky... Hi welcome.

1:06:34.425 --> 1:06:36.526
So, are you nervous?

1:06:37.395 --> 1:06:38.361
Excuse... me?

1:06:38.729 --> 1:06:39.963
Are you nervous?

1:06:40.865 --> 1:06:42.032
Why would I be nervous?

1:06:42.034 --> 1:06:44.968
Because you're getting an
evaluation on your work tonight

1:06:44.970 --> 1:06:46.603
by a best-selling author.

1:06:47.004 --> 1:06:48.672
Right. Yeah.

1:06:48.674 --> 1:06:50.507
Yeah I'm nervous as shit.

1:06:58.616 --> 1:07:00.050
How's your Chicken Diablo,
Ricky?

1:07:00.451 --> 1:07:01.418
You barely touched it.

1:07:01.420 --> 1:07:05.088
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry, here we
go.

1:07:07.692 --> 1:07:08.658
Delicious.

1:07:09.327 --> 1:07:10.493
Tres succulent.

1:07:11.529 --> 1:07:13.430
Yeah, Danita is a great cook.

1:07:13.631 --> 1:07:15.832
I, I sometimes forgotten that
because

1:07:15.834 --> 1:07:17.901
I let her order food a lot,

1:07:18.536 --> 1:07:19.903
oh let her...

1:07:20.471 --> 1:07:22.372
well, you know I spoil her a
little bit.

1:07:22.807 --> 1:07:23.707
Don't I, honey?

1:07:23.941 --> 1:07:25.575
Yes, you're very generous.

1:07:26.110 --> 1:07:29.412
Oh hey, I wasn't fishing for a
compliment, but thanks.

1:07:29.847 --> 1:07:30.947
You're welcome

1:07:36.020 --> 1:07:37.787
I really liked your book, Ricky.

1:07:40.024 --> 1:07:40.790
Thank you...

1:07:40.792 --> 1:07:43.460
I know I said I was going talk
to you about it after dinner,

1:07:43.462 --> 1:07:46.529
to tell you how much I liked it.

1:07:46.531 --> 1:07:48.998
You sure you don't want to wait
until after dinner and

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.401
talk to him upstairs,

1:07:51.403 --> 1:07:54.137
you know, in your office where
you won't be distracted--

1:07:54.605 --> 1:07:55.939
What did you like about it?

1:07:56.540 --> 1:07:57.941
Oh I, I liked the characters,

1:07:57.943 --> 1:07:59.476
the pacing but why in the world

1:07:59.478 --> 1:08:01.478
did you stop after eighty
pages?

1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:02.479
I mean I can't wait to see how
it ends.

1:08:03.047 --> 1:08:04.047
Wow? Really?

1:08:04.049 --> 1:08:08.885
but don't know time passes and
you of lose perspective...

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:10.520
you really liked the pacing?

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:16.693
Sorry, I'm just I... not used to
praise.

1:08:16.927 --> 1:08:18.561
Well, you better get used to it.

1:08:18.563 --> 1:08:20.497
Because after you finish it,

1:08:20.499 --> 1:08:21.631
I plan on sending it to my
publisher.

1:08:22.032 --> 1:08:25.568
Oh my god, thank you!! Oh my...

1:08:27.171 --> 1:08:29.572
But I did have a few notes for
you.

1:08:29.807 --> 1:08:31.141
Uhm and I think Danita's right.

1:08:31.542 --> 1:08:32.942
We can probably focus better
upstairs.

1:08:33.444 --> 1:08:34.611
So after dinner. In my office.

1:08:34.945 --> 1:08:36.045
Is that okay, Ricky?

1:08:36.514 --> 1:08:38.448
Yeah, yeah that's, that's cool.

1:08:38.582 --> 1:08:39.616
Excellent, great.

1:08:39.618 --> 1:08:41.584
Yeah, I'm really looking forward
to it.

1:08:43.621 --> 1:08:44.821
Me too.

1:08:48.859 --> 1:08:51.461
Oh hey, you think there's any
chance that we could uh,

1:08:51.463 --> 1:08:52.762
uh... call the,

1:08:52.897 --> 1:08:56.533
the publisher right now and you
know get,

1:08:56.535 --> 1:08:57.667
get the ball rolling?

1:08:57.669 --> 1:08:59.669
You know what, notes first I
think.

1:09:05.876 --> 1:09:07.744
Well, let me put the dishes
away.

1:09:08.746 --> 1:09:11.714
You two go upstairs and have
your little talk.

1:09:18.155 --> 1:09:19.856
She still insists on cleaning up
herself,

1:09:20.191 --> 1:09:21.791
even though I can easily afford
help.

1:09:24.562 --> 1:09:25.795
Ahh, she's great.

1:09:26.831 --> 1:09:28.131
Isn't she great, Ricky?

1:09:28.766 --> 1:09:29.966
Yes. Very nice.

1:09:30.201 --> 1:09:32.202
Glad you agree.

1:09:32.536 --> 1:09:34.204
Okay, time for the big moment.

1:09:34.672 --> 1:09:35.939
You ready?

1:09:36.774 --> 1:09:38.541
Oh God, I hope so.

1:09:42.112 --> 1:09:44.214
Oh common, let's go do this,
common.

1:09:55.526 --> 1:09:57.527
Uhm, well, why don't you lead
the way.

1:09:57.862 --> 1:09:59.963
Since, it... is your house.

1:10:29.528 --> 1:10:32.529
Why don't we go somewhere else
and talk about your book.

1:10:32.531 --> 1:10:34.597
Somewhere a little more
inspiring.

1:10:35.766 --> 1:10:37.767
Oh and honey, you come too.

1:10:37.769 --> 1:10:40.803
I think it's going to be fun.

1:10:49.747 --> 1:10:50.680
Thanks for driving, honey.

1:10:50.682 --> 1:10:52.782
Gives me more time to chat with
Ricky.

1:10:54.985 --> 1:10:56.286
Where... are we going?

1:10:56.620 --> 1:10:58.855
To a very special place.

1:11:26.150 --> 1:11:30.186
This place is very important to
me.

1:11:31.722 --> 1:11:34.023
It's where I first came up with
the idea...

1:11:34.625 --> 1:11:38.361
that my wife was cheating on me
with a loser like you.

1:11:41.098 --> 1:11:42.799
I'm sorry, honey, I lied to you.

1:11:43.133 --> 1:11:44.968
That night you thought I was
doing a book signing,

1:11:45.336 --> 1:11:48.371
I was actually parked right over
there... Yeah.

1:11:51.775 --> 1:11:53.076
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:11:53.243 --> 1:11:54.978
It was all my fault.

1:11:54.980 --> 1:11:56.646
Just please don't hurt him--

1:11:56.648 --> 1:11:58.915
Hey, hey, can you please just
shut the fuck up, honey?

1:11:59.350 --> 1:12:01.651
I'm trying to converse with our
dinner guest.

1:12:01.952 --> 1:12:03.319
Don't swear at her.

1:12:04.655 --> 1:12:07.757
How chivalrous, Ricky.

1:12:07.759 --> 1:12:09.392
You know, I'm surprised you're
still single.

1:12:09.827 --> 1:12:12.762
You're a real catch.

1:12:13.397 --> 1:12:15.131
Look, why don't you just let her
go?

1:12:15.133 --> 1:12:16.165
You, you don't even love her.

1:12:16.667 --> 1:12:19.736
Wow. That is just so impressive.

1:12:20.638 --> 1:12:23.206
You know exactly what's in my
heart.

1:12:25.676 --> 1:12:27.076
You don't have a heart.

1:12:27.311 --> 1:12:30.013
Now you see, that one hurt.

1:12:31.315 --> 1:12:33.983
Ben, please, please no, please
no.

1:12:35.719 --> 1:12:37.687
I'll stay with you, I'll do
anything you want--

1:12:37.988 --> 1:12:39.155
I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!

1:12:44.962 --> 1:12:46.996
Whoa, hey!

1:12:47.164 --> 1:12:48.364
Don't ever do that again,
wife-killer.

1:12:48.799 --> 1:12:52.402
Now, now Ricky, that was never
proven.

1:12:54.371 --> 1:12:56.272
And it never will be.

1:12:57.374 --> 1:12:58.775
Oh, come on.

1:12:58.777 --> 1:13:01.678
We both know a little
restaurant manager like you

1:13:02.012 --> 1:13:03.379
doesn't have the guts to pull
that trigger.

1:13:04.682 --> 1:13:06.015
Y...Yes, Yes...I...do.

1:13:06.417 --> 1:13:08.985
That might have sounded more
persuasive

1:13:09.153 --> 1:13:10.319
without the stammering.

1:13:13.157 --> 1:13:17.293
You know, this has been hard,
Ricky, you know,

1:13:17.895 --> 1:13:19.462
really hard, going through this
farce.

1:13:20.197 --> 1:13:22.398
Eating with you, being friendly
to you,

1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:23.399
reading your book.

1:13:23.401 --> 1:13:26.069
Yeah, I think that was the
hardest part.

1:13:26.336 --> 1:13:27.437
Reading your book.

1:13:27.439 --> 1:13:31.441
Yeah. It wasn't easy to pretend
that crap was good.

1:13:32.910 --> 1:13:37.313
I mean it was just awful, poorly
written, run-on sentences,

1:13:37.781 --> 1:13:41.317
a clumsy attempt at suspense and
wit, terrible pacing--

1:14:01.405 --> 1:14:02.438
He's... dead.

1:14:05.843 --> 1:14:07.443
Holy shit!

1:14:14.785 --> 1:14:16.352
You did it, dog.

1:14:18.021 --> 1:14:20.757
Pound it.

1:14:24.228 --> 1:14:25.394
Hi, Danita. How's it going?

1:14:25.963 --> 1:14:29.499
Um... okay. Thanks for helping
Seth.

1:14:30.467 --> 1:14:31.434
No problem....

1:14:31.436 --> 1:14:34.036
He's still alive!

1:14:34.171 --> 1:14:35.872
No Sorry. False alarm.

1:14:36.006 --> 1:14:37.440
Hah that's just the wind.

1:14:37.841 --> 1:14:39.876
He's still dead.

1:14:44.081 --> 1:14:45.948
Okay, you better go home.

1:14:46.316 --> 1:14:47.784
You sure I can't help you dump
the body?

1:14:47.786 --> 1:14:50.419
Oh honey, that is so sweet, but
everything has to look normal.

1:14:50.821 --> 1:14:52.421
You have to show everybody
you're home.

1:14:52.423 --> 1:14:54.991
Answer every phone call, turn on
a bunch of lights--

1:14:55.526 --> 1:14:56.893
-I love you.
-I love you.

1:14:57.427 --> 1:14:58.795
I love you more.

1:14:58.797 --> 1:15:00.530
I love you more, plus eight.

1:15:07.337 --> 1:15:08.437
Don't, don't drive so fast.

1:15:09.173 --> 1:15:10.540
You're serious? You just killed
a guy.

1:15:10.542 --> 1:15:11.874
You worried about a speeding
ticket?

1:15:11.876 --> 1:15:13.442
I don't want a cop to stop us,
idiot!

1:15:13.911 --> 1:15:15.244
Right, right, right.

1:15:15.246 --> 1:15:17.246
I'm sorry, I'm nervous, why am I
so nervous?

1:15:17.514 --> 1:15:19.448
There's a dead body in the trunk
and you're an accountant.

1:15:20.417 --> 1:15:22.952
You work at Debby's, that's not
that much more macho.

1:15:23.287 --> 1:15:24.554
No, I didn't mean it as a dig.

1:15:25.022 --> 1:15:26.222
Of course you didn't.

1:15:26.224 --> 1:15:27.256
That's not a good dig.

1:15:27.258 --> 1:15:28.457
I'm so nervous!

1:15:28.459 --> 1:15:30.193
Okay..."Plan A." We dump him in
the ocean.

1:15:31.929 --> 1:15:33.896
Won't we need to rent a boat or
something?

1:15:33.898 --> 1:15:36.432
We can't just place him in the
shallow end.

1:15:36.434 --> 1:15:38.201
And you're not that great of a
swimmer.

1:15:38.203 --> 1:15:40.269
I'm, I'm not that bad. I'm not
that bad.

1:15:40.271 --> 1:15:41.904
C'mon, you never even go in the
deep end.

1:15:41.906 --> 1:15:45.208
I was accidentally dropped in a
pool by my mother

1:15:45.210 --> 1:15:46.442
when I was a baby. It was very
traumatic.

1:15:46.577 --> 1:15:48.244
I know, I know I'm sorry.

1:15:48.478 --> 1:15:49.946
Ah crap, it's almost midnight.

1:15:49.948 --> 1:15:52.481
We wouldn't even be able to rent
a boat if we wanted to.

1:15:52.916 --> 1:15:54.450
See... I got it, I got it.

1:15:54.585 --> 1:15:55.518
We'll dump him off a cliff!

1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:58.287
Becau.. no we can't right,
because you have a fear of
heights...

1:15:58.489 --> 1:16:02.558
condominium when I was little.

1:16:07.464 --> 1:16:08.397
Oh...

1:16:12.169 --> 1:16:15.304
Sorry to put this murdering scum
beside you, Mr. Dead Movie Star.

1:16:21.511 --> 1:16:25.982
Hey... Hey... Hey!

1:16:27.651 --> 1:16:29.352
Oh, sorry, sorry...what is it?

1:16:29.519 --> 1:16:30.653
You okay, man? Shit, man.

1:16:30.655 --> 1:16:32.955
You've been like in your own
world the last two weeks.

1:16:34.024 --> 1:16:35.224
No, no, I'm fine. What is it?

1:16:35.425 --> 1:16:37.026
That guy over there wants to
talk to you.

1:16:37.394 --> 1:16:38.995
Jesus!

1:16:41.565 --> 1:16:42.932
Wha, what does he want?

1:16:42.934 --> 1:16:44.667
I don't know, man. He said he
wants to talk to you.

1:16:45.270 --> 1:16:48.337
Okay, thanks.

1:17:03.453 --> 1:17:07.156
Hello, Officer. Uh, you, wanted
to talk to me?

1:17:09.326 --> 1:17:10.293
You Ricky Miller?

1:17:10.427 --> 1:17:11.460
Yeah, yeah.

1:17:11.929 --> 1:17:13.429
I got something I got to ask
you.

1:17:13.697 --> 1:17:15.564
Okay...

1:17:16.533 --> 1:17:17.566
You know this woman?

1:17:17.568 --> 1:17:19.635
No.

1:17:20.504 --> 1:17:22.939
Oh, oh. Oh wait... I do, I do.

1:17:22.941 --> 1:17:24.240
That's a... this is, this is my
Aunt Toby.

1:17:24.441 --> 1:17:27.543
I knew it. Me and you are
related, man.

1:17:28.212 --> 1:17:30.446
Yeah! Toby Miller, she my aunt.

1:17:30.448 --> 1:17:33.516
She once mentioned she had a
nephew who manages a Debby's.

1:17:33.518 --> 1:17:36.652
but I'm really big into that
'family tree' kind of thing...

1:17:38.121 --> 1:17:40.556
No, no, it's, it is not dumb at
all, it is,

1:17:41.224 --> 1:17:43.960
it is great that you care about
family trees.

1:17:45.128 --> 1:17:47.430
I mean it's, it's fucking
fantastic.

1:18:01.511 --> 1:18:04.347
Hi, honey. I'm home.

1:18:05.415 --> 1:18:06.349
Ricky...

1:18:06.616 --> 1:18:08.117
I've missed you so much.

1:18:10.754 --> 1:18:13.189
It's been so hard not even being
able to text you.

1:18:13.423 --> 1:18:14.757
I know, I know. But we have to
be careful.

1:18:15.325 --> 1:18:16.659
That's why it was so smart to
meet here.

1:18:17.227 --> 1:18:18.527
No one would expect to find a
Jew in here.

1:18:19.496 --> 1:18:20.496
You're Jewish?

1:18:21.064 --> 1:18:22.598
No. I thought you were.

1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:24.133
You know, cause you're married
to the...

1:18:24.335 --> 1:18:28.204
He was a rabbi who liked shiksas
and he also ate pork.

1:18:31.408 --> 1:18:33.209
The police have been questioning
me.

1:18:33.211 --> 1:18:36.078
I think they always suspect the
spouse first.

1:18:36.780 --> 1:18:39.181
At least they do on "48 Hours"
and "American Justice."

1:18:39.583 --> 1:18:40.683
Wait, you watch those shows
too?!

1:18:40.685 --> 1:18:42.585
Oh, those are my two favorite
shows on TV!

1:18:42.587 --> 1:18:45.688
Wait, have you ever seen "True
Crime with Aphrodite Jones?"

1:18:46.156 --> 1:18:47.189
Shut up! I love that.

1:18:51.128 --> 1:18:53.462
It is bat-shit crazy how much we
have in common.

1:18:54.264 --> 1:18:55.131
I love you so much, baby.

1:18:55.133 --> 1:18:57.800
I love you more plus... wait
what are we at?

1:18:58.168 --> 1:18:59.335
Nineteen.

1:18:59.803 --> 1:19:01.303
Nineteen. Twenty.

1:19:04.808 --> 1:19:06.575
Sooooo, what do you think?

1:19:08.111 --> 1:19:08.644
I don't know...

1:19:09.180 --> 1:19:11.447
I'm getting married on Saturday.
I want to look dapper.

1:19:11.449 --> 1:19:12.548
Which one?

1:19:12.749 --> 1:19:15.384
Oh Sorry. That one!

1:19:15.386 --> 1:19:17.553
Yeah, yeah I thought so too,
it's definitely the better...

1:19:17.555 --> 1:19:20.289
less blue... good..hey, where's
Danita?

1:19:21.058 --> 1:19:22.425
I've been trying to get hold of
her

1:19:22.427 --> 1:19:23.492
to invite her to the wedding-

1:19:23.494 --> 1:19:24.493
You can't invite her!

1:19:24.495 --> 1:19:25.795
I have to invite her. She's your
girlfriend.

1:19:25.797 --> 1:19:28.097
Are you insane? We can't be seen
together.

1:19:28.099 --> 1:19:29.598
Alright, alright, relax,

1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:31.300
I couldn't get a hold of her
anyway.

1:19:31.501 --> 1:19:32.635
She probably changed her number
and

1:19:32.637 --> 1:19:35.438
then I went by her house and her
neighbor said

1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:36.505
she saw her leaving with a bunch
of suitcases.

1:19:36.507 --> 1:19:38.374
Where was she going, man?

1:19:41.078 --> 1:19:43.479
Oh Shit, you knew, you knew
that, right?

1:20:11.441 --> 1:20:12.308
Hey guys...

1:20:12.509 --> 1:20:13.709
Hey... Ricky.

1:20:14.578 --> 1:20:15.811
There he is huh?

1:20:15.813 --> 1:20:20.416
It's Saturday night and you are
gonna dooooo it.

1:20:20.584 --> 1:20:21.684
Time for you to get paid and
laid and

1:20:21.686 --> 1:20:22.785
find yourself a soulmate, huh?

1:20:22.787 --> 1:20:26.222
No... I already got hit by
lightning and found a soulmate.

1:20:26.556 --> 1:20:28.624
Now it's time for me to get
killed by a terrorist.

1:20:29.526 --> 1:20:31.327
Oh C'mon Ricky, you'll meet
someone else.

1:20:32.529 --> 1:20:35.331
Look, it took me over forty
years to find the first one.

1:20:36.433 --> 1:20:40.202
Now it'll take at least that,
and by then I'll be in hell.

1:20:40.537 --> 1:20:41.637
That's not true.

1:20:41.639 --> 1:20:43.405
You're such a sweet man, Ricky.

1:20:43.407 --> 1:20:44.740
And why would you ever go to
hell?

1:20:47.444 --> 1:20:50.146
God, I can't keep this in
anymore.

1:20:50.714 --> 1:20:52.581
About nine months ago, I--

1:20:52.583 --> 1:20:54.250
He stole a Snapple.

1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:59.488
He stole a Snapple, he's been
bent up about it ever since,

1:20:59.490 --> 1:21:02.658
The Snapple that you stole,
from the store.

1:21:05.462 --> 1:21:10.266
Yeah, I stole a Snapple. Just
for the thrill.

1:21:19.509 --> 1:21:20.376
Hey!

1:21:22.546 --> 1:21:24.580
Hey, cuz!

1:21:28.885 --> 1:21:30.352
Hey.

1:21:30.354 --> 1:21:33.489
Hey, hey, good to see you again.
How's it goin'?

1:21:33.690 --> 1:21:35.291
Not bad, can't complain...

1:21:35.625 --> 1:21:36.425
How's work?

1:21:36.427 --> 1:21:38.761
Ah, you know. So how's...work
for you?

1:21:38.962 --> 1:21:40.462
Interesting...

1:21:40.464 --> 1:21:44.667
was at the station before when a
serial killer came in and

1:21:44.868 --> 1:21:46.635
confessed to a bunch of murders.

1:21:46.970 --> 1:21:49.205
He even confessed to killing
that guy, what's his name,

1:21:49.639 --> 1:21:51.340
the author who died last year--

1:21:52.442 --> 1:21:52.841
Ben Jacobs!

1:21:55.445 --> 1:21:57.513
Um, I, I... believe that was his
name.

1:21:58.348 --> 1:22:00.549
There, there were those
articles on, the internet-

1:22:01.351 --> 1:22:03.619
Ben Jacobs, that's it... yeah!

1:22:06.590 --> 1:22:08.591
So... so someone confessed?

1:22:09.226 --> 1:22:09.959
Yeah.

1:22:11.795 --> 1:22:12.528
Holy shit!

1:22:12.530 --> 1:22:16.332
Yeah, I tell ya, you get these
nut jobs that come in,

1:22:16.499 --> 1:22:17.967
they confess to murders they
didn't even commit,

1:22:18.468 --> 1:22:20.603
but this guy... really
convincing.

1:22:20.605 --> 1:22:22.338
Yeah, I wasn't even there and I
believe him.

1:22:22.672 --> 1:22:25.874
So we arrested him and I hope
the bastard fries!

1:22:27.611 --> 1:22:30.246
I hope he fries and they hang
him.

1:22:30.714 --> 1:22:32.414
That's a little excessive, cuz.

1:22:33.350 --> 1:22:35.618
Holly shit.

1:22:44.661 --> 1:22:46.562
You again, God?

1:22:46.930 --> 1:22:52.568
Oh that was so sweet... and a
little sick.

1:22:53.370 --> 1:22:55.404
Why would you let an innocent,
um...

1:22:55.639 --> 1:22:58.707
serial killer get punished for
something I did?

1:23:01.278 --> 1:23:04.313
My life is over anyway.

1:23:12.522 --> 1:23:14.056
You like "Lost in America" too?

1:23:16.893 --> 1:23:18.027
Oh my god.

1:23:18.962 --> 1:23:20.529
You must have hated me.

1:23:20.531 --> 1:23:24.400
You must have thought I ran away
and that I'd never come back.

1:23:25.769 --> 1:23:27.736
Yeah, it kind of crossed my
mind.

1:23:29.606 --> 1:23:31.740
The police were starting to
suspect me, more and more,

1:23:31.941 --> 1:23:34.510
so I ditched my phone, any
record of you and...

1:23:34.678 --> 1:23:38.080
I knew we wouldn't be able to
stay away from each other.

1:23:39.983 --> 1:23:42.551
So I got on a plane and flew
half way around the world and

1:23:42.819 --> 1:23:45.854
just kept of flying and kept on
running...

1:23:46.923 --> 1:23:53.495
and then...I heard something on
the news about a killer

1:23:53.730 --> 1:23:55.331
that was arrested back in
America

1:23:55.532 --> 1:23:57.833
for the murder of Ben Jacobs.

1:23:58.702 --> 1:24:00.602
I'm pretty sure he's innocent.

1:24:02.072 --> 1:24:03.439
Me too.

1:24:04.607 --> 1:24:07.609
The police seem to believe him
though.

1:24:08.411 --> 1:24:11.447
It's crazy... how could this
happen--

1:24:12.949 --> 1:24:16.051
I pray to a deranged deity.

1:24:18.922 --> 1:24:20.489
I'm so sorry, Ricky.

1:24:23.593 --> 1:24:25.728
You must have thought I was one
of those... you know,

1:24:26.696 --> 1:24:29.598
'movie bitches,' like Seth kept
warning you about--

1:24:30.467 --> 1:24:33.035
No, no, I could never think
you're one of those bitches,
never.

1:24:34.137 --> 1:24:38.407
Okay, maybe a few, times, okay,
several times,

1:24:39.109 --> 1:24:41.577
in my, smallest, darkest
moments--

1:24:43.513 --> 1:24:44.580
oh my god, I love you.

1:24:45.615 --> 1:24:48.717
I love you more, plus infinity.

1:24:50.153 --> 1:24:52.588
I love you more, plus double
infinity.

1:24:53.890 --> 1:24:59.695
I love you more, plus triple...
oh, Holy shit-balls, you win.

1:25:08.505 --> 1:25:10.672
I was a... widow,

1:25:11.641 --> 1:25:13.575
and I thought it was too late to
meet a soulmate,

1:25:13.877 --> 1:25:15.778
that I'd have a better chance of
getting hit by lightning,

1:25:16.579 --> 1:25:18.981
and then one day, the perfect
guy appeared.

1:25:21.050 --> 1:25:25.654
I used to work here, but then I
met Danita, my inspiration,

1:25:26.156 --> 1:25:30.692
my, my muse, and a, now I've
written two best-sellers and

1:25:31.161 --> 1:25:32.928
one of them might even be made
into a movie...

1:25:35.498 --> 1:25:37.633
with Ashton Kutcher.

1:25:39.536 --> 1:25:41.570
And he's gotten me to start
painting again too.
