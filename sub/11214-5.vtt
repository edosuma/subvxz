WEBVTT

00:35.669 --> 00:50.151
(big city night sounds)

00:59.627 --> 01:02.330
It's said a recurring nightmare
for police officers

01:02.330 --> 01:04.365
involves losing their gun.

01:04.365 --> 01:07.701
For Detective Salinger, the
nightmare has just come true.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.540
Tammi.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.009
Tammi.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.045
I-I'll be right out.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.614
I thought you just had to pee.

01:25.052 --> 01:27.155
Now you're taking a shower?

01:27.155 --> 01:28.156
I-I worked
out today,

01:28.156 --> 01:30.458
babe.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.594
You're just gonna get sweaty
all over again, honey.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.131
Tammi?

01:40.067 --> 01:42.470
Unbelievable.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.878
Back!

01:50.878 --> 01:52.513
Richter, back, back!

01:54.382 --> 01:58.085
It helps me relax, okay?

01:58.085 --> 02:00.020
And having sex
with me doesn't?

02:00.020 --> 02:02.723
No, Sammy,
it just makes me forget

02:02.723 --> 02:05.493
all the other crap, okay?

02:07.395 --> 02:11.031
The way you're looking at me,
does not make me feel desirable.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.132
He's a drug dog, Tammi.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.000
Flush it.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.402
Put him out in the yard.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.003
He's gonna wake up
the entire neighborhood.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.205
Flush it!

02:17.205 --> 02:18.639
I'm your wife, I'm not a perp.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.541
(scoffs)

02:22.410 --> 02:24.278
(toilet flushes)
Is that all of it?

02:24.278 --> 02:26.614
Yeah, that's all of it.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.781
(sighs softly)

02:27.781 --> 02:29.717
You used to like it.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.265
(sighs softly)

02:44.265 --> 02:46.300
ENID:
You're getting in late.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.203
Yeah, the interrogation
went on long.

02:49.203 --> 02:52.673
Well... I could heat up

02:52.673 --> 02:56.510
the salmon I made for
dinner, three hours ago.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.478
Sorry.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.912
I should've called.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.914
That's all right;
I know you're busy.

03:00.914 --> 03:04.352
Well, are you gonna
ask me what happened

03:04.352 --> 03:05.986
with the realtor?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.054
Okay.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.188
What happened
with the realtor?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.423
He said that
I've maintained

03:09.423 --> 03:11.359
the house beautifully
all these years,

03:11.359 --> 03:13.126
And he's gonna put it
on the market for more

03:13.126 --> 03:14.728
than I thought.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.997
Well, that doesn't mean
you're gonna get that price.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.566
Not in today's crazy market.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.635
Well, I could always reduce
the price if I had to.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.337
I mean, the house
is paid for,

03:23.337 --> 03:27.107
so everything at this
point would be profit.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.676
Well, what if
you get to Paris,

03:28.676 --> 03:31.144
and it's not everything that
you thought it was gonna be?

03:31.144 --> 03:32.212
You won't have a place

03:32.212 --> 03:33.447
to come home to.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.648
I'm taking a leap

03:34.648 --> 03:35.749
of faith.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.785
You should, too.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.292
(knocking)

03:47.895 --> 03:48.896
Hi.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.697
A man called 911?

03:49.697 --> 03:50.898
Yeah.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.900
Uh, it's okay.
It's been resolved.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.101
Who called 911?

03:54.101 --> 03:55.202
My friend.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.504
He's fine.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.105
Could your friend come
to the door, please?

03:58.105 --> 04:00.308
MAN:
Okay.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.413
Uh, she didn't,
she didn't do this.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.447
I threw the cat.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.449
Excuse me?

04:08.449 --> 04:09.583
I threw the
cat at him.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.419
He cheated on me...

04:11.419 --> 04:12.620
You want to press
charges, sir?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.121
For what?
Assault with

04:14.121 --> 04:16.189
a deadly animal?
No. I don't
want to press charges.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.992
She's-she's gonna move out
for a little while.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.394
That's a good idea.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.396
Let's go.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.931
Who takes the cat?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.966
I do. You don't think
I'm letting her take the cat.

04:25.966 --> 04:26.834
It's my cat!

04:26.834 --> 04:28.436
Yeah, and you--
Thank you, guys.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.471
Thank you.
Oh, yeah,
thank you, guys.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.905
You can't care for him.
Look at what you did...

04:31.905 --> 04:33.674
JOHN:
Misdemeanor not committed
in our presence.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.377
He doesn't want to make
an arrest, we're out of here.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.751
Well, now, today you
get to ride in style.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.355
Nice dinner.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.589
Yeah.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.324
Almost felt like
a real date.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.859
Come here.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.296
(both moan softly)

04:56.296 --> 04:58.231
Got to go.

04:58.231 --> 05:01.335
Can't work some breaking case
into the wee hours tonight?

05:01.335 --> 05:02.736
No.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.639
I can't.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.177
(door closes)

05:10.177 --> 05:11.979
(sighs softly)

05:11.979 --> 05:14.314
(over stereo):
* When it all gets too heavy

05:14.314 --> 05:17.351
* That's when they come
and they go *

05:17.351 --> 05:19.553
* Oh, they go

05:19.553 --> 05:22.656
* With only one thing
in common *

05:22.656 --> 05:25.459
* They got the fire down below

05:29.096 --> 05:31.031
(music stops)

05:42.075 --> 05:44.177
Get the driver door.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.780
Get the driver.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.184
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.185
Yo, what is that?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.521
Oh, he's five-oh, man.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.755
Oh, he-he dead?

05:54.755 --> 05:56.223
Well, we ain't
trying to wait

05:56.223 --> 05:57.324
to find out.
Yo, check it.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.392
Po-po's MP3s.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.292
(both laugh)

05:59.292 --> 06:00.494
(exhales)

06:00.494 --> 06:02.696
Yo, I think
he's alive.
Oh!

06:05.466 --> 06:07.601
(exhales)

06:13.807 --> 06:15.075
(groans)

06:31.158 --> 06:32.860
They ain't saying squat.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.662
The radiator's busted, the
whole front end's trashed.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.929
That car
ain't moving.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.232
Want me to call this in
or am I gonna do it?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.233
You're kidding
me, right?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.635
What are you talking about?

06:41.635 --> 06:43.504
He was in an accident, Sammy;
his weapon was stolen.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.205
It's legit.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.440
Not if you've had a prior DUI.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.675
What the hell
you talking...

06:47.675 --> 06:49.376
He got nailed
ten or 15 years ago.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.343
Some crap like that.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.845
That's why he called us.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.682
So what, you think he's
under the influence now?

06:54.682 --> 06:57.184
You think I'm gonna give him
a Breathalyzer?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.852
Look, he's a good cop.

06:58.852 --> 07:02.389
He's not on the take,
he's not shaking anybody down

07:02.389 --> 07:04.525
or stealing dope.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.596
He had a few over the course
of a couple of hours.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.598
What's the big deal?

07:10.598 --> 07:12.700
He's been a great boss
for the both of us.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.835
That still doesn't
make it right, Sammy.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.476
Sal, you all right?

07:23.376 --> 07:24.978
Sal, you all right?

07:24.978 --> 07:28.115
Sons of bitches took it
right out of my holster!

07:30.417 --> 07:31.852
You believe that?!

07:31.852 --> 07:34.121
It's not enough
just to take my wallet.

07:34.121 --> 07:38.592
Sal... your nose
is still bleeding.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.328
Ain't nothing
sacred anymore?

07:41.328 --> 07:42.630
Tell you,
they'll be damn lucky

07:42.630 --> 07:44.598
I don't kill them
when I find them.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.600
You think it was
just kids, local?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.903
Or the bangers
who T-boned me!

07:49.903 --> 07:52.239
It was a black
Monte Carlo.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.441
Look, we're gonna handle
this for you, all right?

07:54.441 --> 07:56.476
Listen to me,
the other car

07:56.476 --> 07:58.712
was a yellow
Mitsubishi Eclipse, recent.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.648
Seriously, you probably
have a concussion.

08:00.648 --> 08:01.882
I'm fine!

08:07.755 --> 08:11.792
I don't know,
maybe I ought to call it in.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.562
Oh, you know what?

08:14.562 --> 08:16.630
Let's just do it,
all right?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.298
Let's do
the whole nine yards.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.768
Let's just do the Breathalyzer,
let's just get it over with.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.571
Sal, if you have any
alcohol, any at all,

08:23.571 --> 08:27.140
even .001, this ain't
gonna go right.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.643
We got your back.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.547
Garbage calls, hmm?

08:33.547 --> 08:34.548
Garbage calls.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.083
After the first one,

08:36.083 --> 08:38.485
you know the whole watch
is gonna be like that.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.554
There's nothing
you can do about it.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.857
Just ride it out.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.627
Usually lasts a day or two.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.829
What do you want
to talk about?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.332
(chuckles)
I don't know.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.234
"Who gets the cat?"

08:54.234 --> 08:55.235
That was...

08:55.235 --> 08:56.637
(both laugh)

08:56.637 --> 08:58.672
What are you,
a cat lover?

08:58.672 --> 09:00.107
(both laugh)

09:00.107 --> 09:01.642
Oh, God, "assault with
a deadly animal."

09:01.642 --> 09:04.612
Man, I could've
smacked that chick.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.915
(chuckles)

09:07.915 --> 09:09.983
Put the squeeze on and I
guarantee it'll turn up.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.018
NATE:
Zip on the Mitsubishi.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.252
What about the
Monte Carlo?

09:12.252 --> 09:14.254
Nothing so far.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.256
(distant gunfire)

09:16.256 --> 09:17.658
Did you guys hear that?!

09:17.658 --> 09:18.959
Did you hear that?!
That's my Beretta.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.360
Sal, this is
South Central.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.229
It could be anybody's.
It could be a firecracker.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.397
No, no, no. I know the sound
of my own weapon. That's it.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.966
Listen, whatever the
hell it is, it's pretty

09:25.966 --> 09:28.001
damn close, Sal.
Sal, we got this.
Go home.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.169
Go home!

09:29.169 --> 09:30.270
Go, go, go!

09:32.606 --> 09:34.708
This is nuts,
you know that?

09:34.708 --> 09:35.709
Liquor store.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.845
Glass is blown out.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.026
(car alarm wailing in distance)

09:54.895 --> 09:56.363
WOMAN:
Over here.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.397
You all right?

09:57.397 --> 09:58.565
Yeah.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.200
Are you alone?
Are you alone?!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.601
Yeah, yeah!

10:04.672 --> 10:07.040
(panting)

10:08.341 --> 10:10.443
What happened?
CLERK:
I don't know.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.412
Somebody started shooting,
so I ducked under the counter.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.614
Did you see where
the shooting started?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.449
The parking lot.
That corner there, I think.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.452
Did you get a look at anybody?
Did you see any vehicles?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.821
Not really, no.
I wasn't paying

10:20.821 --> 10:22.756
that much attention.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.792
Does your surveillance camera

10:24.792 --> 10:28.929
record to tape
or hard drive, ma'am?

10:32.565 --> 10:35.769
NATE: No bodies, no blood,
no guns-- just a few casings.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.537
Anything from a nine?

10:37.537 --> 10:38.839
Yeah, and a .45,
and a .40.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.407
It's a nice little
ghetto load.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.608
Dispatch said shots fired.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.443
Yeah, suspects fled,
no description.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.545
We're getting surveillance
on 'em right now.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.115
All right, I'll call it in.
You detectives working late?

10:48.115 --> 10:51.618
SAMMY: Yeah, we were... just
doing some follow-up on a case.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.420
We rolled over
when we heard the shots.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.924
OFFICER: Yeah, suspects have
already fled the scene.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.859
No description...

11:03.163 --> 11:05.165
Kimmy?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.200
Good night, Dad.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.201
Kimmy!

11:08.201 --> 11:09.870
What?

11:09.870 --> 11:13.006
You didn't hear me
when I came in.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.708
So?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.409
You need to be
more aware, Kimmy.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.610
You need to listen.

11:17.610 --> 11:18.846
Whatever.
Good night, Dad.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.017
Hey, what do you do if you hear
somebody inside the house?

11:25.585 --> 11:28.255
Get out.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.190
What if you hear somebody
outside the house?

11:30.190 --> 11:32.659
Stay in.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.195
And if someone got in
and tried to drag you out?

11:35.195 --> 11:38.565
Go limp, and make myself
dead weight.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.867
Good night, Dad.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.634
And if they put their hand
over your mouth?

11:41.634 --> 11:43.303
You are such a freak.

11:43.303 --> 11:43.937
Kimmy?

11:43.937 --> 11:45.072
Dad, I am tired,

11:45.072 --> 11:47.207
and I am trying to sleep.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.508
This is serious.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.777
Someone took
my wallet tonight,

11:49.777 --> 11:51.444
and now they know our address.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.747
(groans)

11:53.747 --> 11:56.016
(muffled scream)

12:02.622 --> 12:04.424
Bye. (sighs)

12:04.424 --> 12:07.795
Kenny and Andy are
coming to help us.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.696
Did you tell 'em why?

12:09.696 --> 12:12.532
Mostly.
What have we got?

12:12.532 --> 12:18.405
Just like he said, late-model
Mitsubishi Eclipse.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.242
Signs they're throwing--
77th Street Locs, my guess.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.812
Mm-hmm, got a
lot of enemies.
That the Monte

12:24.812 --> 12:26.446
Sal was talking about?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.515
Yeah, I think so.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.386
That's bold.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.990
Boom! I'll check the local
hospitals, see if they have

12:36.990 --> 12:40.393
any shooting victims.

12:40.393 --> 12:43.763
Hey, back that up real quick,
right there.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.634
Check out his weapon.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.769
It's a Beretta.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.513
MAN:
Do you want some?

13:02.215 --> 13:03.050
Excuse me?

13:03.050 --> 13:06.319
Do you want some?

13:07.520 --> 13:11.058
Gee, do I want some?

13:11.058 --> 13:13.293
Uh, let me get a closer look.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.930
That way I can make a better
decision for myself.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.037
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, what are you...?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.907
LYDIA:
What's your name
and date of birth, sir?

13:26.907 --> 13:30.477
Stanley Sidelsky.
August 20, 1960.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.544
I'm-I'm sorry.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.546
Yeah, I'm sure you are.
I...

13:34.982 --> 13:36.850
One King 54.

13:36.850 --> 13:41.621
Code Six, show me at Burbank
and Kenwood with one in custody.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.724
Yeah. I've got a 311.

13:44.724 --> 13:48.328
Stanley Sidelsky. 8-20-60.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.397
Show me en route to the station.

13:50.397 --> 13:54.534
So, Stanley, you
the Valley Molester?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.536
Oh, God, no.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.105
Nothing like that.

13:58.105 --> 14:01.508
Man, I gotta tell you,
I've seen one before, but...

14:01.508 --> 14:06.679
You do this to a kid?
That's very, very bad.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.281
I know.

14:08.281 --> 14:12.019
So, what are we gonna
do about it, huh?

14:12.019 --> 14:14.121
You ever been to therapy?

14:14.121 --> 14:18.258
Oh, I've tried-- lots of
different modalities.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.994
(garbled dispatch transmission)

14:20.994 --> 14:23.230
(sobbing quietly)

14:23.230 --> 14:27.367
No reports of shooting victims
at any area hospitals,

14:27.367 --> 14:30.637
so in all likelihood,
this guy is dead,

14:30.637 --> 14:32.372
and dumped in a field somewhere.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.542
KENNY NO-GUN: You guys
didn't report any of this?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.310
We take care of our own.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.247
We have any blue-suits who can
help put some pressure

14:40.247 --> 14:42.815
on the neighborhood?
Vice, Narco?

14:42.815 --> 14:44.717
Call in some favors.
No problem.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.353
Is Sal coming in?
SAMMY:
Yeah, later.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.854
Look, these guys
know what we're after.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.389
Until we get it back,

14:49.389 --> 14:52.592
we issue citations for
loitering, unlawful assembly,

14:52.592 --> 14:54.161
disturbing the peace.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.628
A banger stubs out a smoke

14:55.628 --> 14:58.098
on the sidewalk, we
bring him in for littering.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.200
Unpaid parking tickets,
no insurance,

15:00.200 --> 15:01.734
they don't feed
the meter?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.236
Bye-bye, wheels.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.406
Whatever works.
Got it.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.846
It's not illegal.
My dad's a lawyer.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.583
Why are you doing this?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.850
It's for the money, man.

15:17.850 --> 15:18.851
The money?

15:18.851 --> 15:19.852
(coins jangling)

15:19.852 --> 15:21.989
(chuckling)

15:21.989 --> 15:23.556
There's not even
any radar up there!

15:23.556 --> 15:25.025
They don't know that.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.059
(laughter)

15:26.059 --> 15:27.995
Oh, man...
I got it...

15:27.995 --> 15:28.795
Here.
Thank you.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.063
That's classic.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.365
Stay in school.
All right? (laughs)

15:32.365 --> 15:34.934
BOOKING OFFICER: Are you sick,
disabled or on medication?

15:34.934 --> 15:35.935
No.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.271
Get some real help, Stanley.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.473
All right? Don't give up.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.482
(Russell laughing)

15:49.482 --> 15:53.920
So, wait, he exposed
himself to you?

15:53.920 --> 15:57.757
That's crazy.
All right, see ya.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.327
(sighs)

16:00.327 --> 16:04.097
"His tour ended at 5:00.
He didn't get home till 1:00.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.898
Any ideas, ladies?"

16:05.898 --> 16:07.434
You're a dick.

16:07.434 --> 16:11.004
You should consider changing
the name to "I Hate A Cop."

16:11.004 --> 16:14.041
Russ, do you
think I hate you?

16:14.041 --> 16:16.543
I think you resent me.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.544
Based on what?

16:17.544 --> 16:19.112
Based on the fact

16:19.112 --> 16:20.680
that you vent
to a bunch of women

16:20.680 --> 16:23.250
who pretend they like
being married to cops.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.386
It's not venting; it's writing.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.321
I majored in
journalism, hello?

16:28.321 --> 16:31.424
It's gossip and complaining.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.293
Bye.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.629
SAMMY: Good morning,
gentlemen...

16:36.629 --> 16:39.366
and welcome to California
Penal Code Section 408--

16:39.366 --> 16:42.435
participating in
an unlawful assembly.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.204
What the hell
are you talking about, homie?

16:44.204 --> 16:46.306
We're just trying to get
some damn food to eat!

16:46.306 --> 16:49.409
Say hello to Section 415,

16:49.409 --> 16:51.378
otherwise known as
disturbing the peace.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.580
See, this is what I'm talking
about right here, fellas.
Cuff him.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.415
This is what I'm talking about
right here, man.
Cuff him.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.284
This is what I'm talking about
right here, man.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.052
But he ain't done nothing!
Ma'am your boyfriend's

16:59.052 --> 17:01.388
in violation of the conditions
of his ankle monitor.
What?!

17:01.388 --> 17:02.889
But he lives right
next door! That is stupid!

17:02.889 --> 17:04.724
Have a nice day, ma'am.
That's all right.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.626
I'm hittin' your mama,
I'm a-call your mama!

17:06.626 --> 17:10.397
I got Johnnie Cochran's firm on
speed-dial, just so you know!

17:10.397 --> 17:12.632
Uh, the debit card, too.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.468
No, no, I don't have the little
thing with the numbers on it.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.871
Can't you just use my Social?

17:18.871 --> 17:23.042
Uh, hey, can I, um... can I put
you on hold for just a sec?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.444
I-I got somebody
on the other line.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.515
(sighs)

17:31.451 --> 17:32.252
Hey.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.421
Hi. Did I wake you?

17:34.421 --> 17:36.389
They got me covering
an apartment fire.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.490
Yeah, listen, I, um...

17:37.490 --> 17:38.925
can't talk right now, all right?

17:38.925 --> 17:40.427
Oh... Is your wife nearby?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.928
No, I'm on the line with

17:41.928 --> 17:44.431
the credit card company;
I lost my wallet last night.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.366
Did you leave it
at the restaurant?

17:46.366 --> 17:48.535
Listen, I can't talk, okay?

17:51.638 --> 17:52.439
(phone rings)

17:52.439 --> 17:53.440
(grunts):
Damn it.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.008
I can't talk right now!

17:56.008 --> 17:57.477
Sal?

17:57.477 --> 17:59.279
Hey, so what?
Did you find it?

17:59.279 --> 18:00.747
No, not yet.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.850
(sighs) All right, well,
who've you talked to?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.818
Bangers from Grape Street,

18:05.818 --> 18:08.721
Rollin 60's, HCC,

18:08.721 --> 18:11.624
neighbors, hookers,
anybody we can pop.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.893
What about Big Wayne?
Listen, I don't give a shit

18:13.893 --> 18:15.628
how many "God bless you's"
he throws around.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.465
He'll know something.
And if he doesn't,

18:18.465 --> 18:20.400
that fat slug can get word out
the bangers got

18:20.400 --> 18:21.868
something that doesn't
belong to them.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.803
Done and done.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.275
How long are we
gonna keep this up?

18:32.412 --> 18:35.182
As long as it takes.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.620
Look at this place.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.156
Lowlife dealer
sues us and wins.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.392
Up is down, I'm telling you.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.127
Yeah, well, he
is reformed now.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.463
He put hoses down
guys' throats

18:50.463 --> 18:52.232
till their guts burst.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.733
Now he's seen the light?

18:53.733 --> 18:56.002
No, he just can't get
around as well, that's it.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.270
(knocking)

18:58.137 --> 18:59.138
(rhythmic sputtering)

18:59.138 --> 19:01.808
(sighing)

19:01.808 --> 19:04.177
Yes?

19:04.177 --> 19:06.713
Is your father home?

19:06.713 --> 19:09.849
Big Wayne! There's some men here
to see you.

19:09.849 --> 19:10.817
Well, let them in.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.788
(chuckles): If it
isn't my lottery tickets.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.424
What up?
How you doing,
Big Wayne?

19:17.424 --> 19:18.925
Well, since the settlement
from the city,

19:18.925 --> 19:23.330
I've been able to get full-time
physical therapy.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.665
How's your
youth center going?

19:25.665 --> 19:26.899
Oh, very well.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.836
You should come by
and give a motivational speech.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.538
Yeah, maybe we
should do that, huh?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.540
So, what brings
you two here?
I'll be honest.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.708
One of our guys was
in a traffic accident

19:35.708 --> 19:37.244
a few blocks from the station.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.778
He was knocked out
and had his gun stolen.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.547
(laughs)
We just want
the gun back.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.916
He had his gun stolen.
So, you're telling me this why?

19:43.916 --> 19:45.818
Well, we're telling
you just in case you

19:45.818 --> 19:48.621
or one of the young people that
work with you hear something--

19:48.621 --> 19:49.922
you know, through the grapevine.

19:49.922 --> 19:53.125
Oh, through the grapevine.
Yeah, okay.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.927
You'll keep us posted?

19:54.927 --> 19:56.929
Oh, sure! I'm a police
supporter, you know?

19:56.929 --> 19:59.932
If I hadn't been shot by one,
I wouldn't have the money

19:59.932 --> 20:03.169
for my youth center or
to start my business.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.337
I thank you for it.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.172
Thanks for your time.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.441
No, thank you.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.510
SAMMY:
Youth center, my ass.

20:10.510 --> 20:14.314
He uses it as a front for
dealing and God knows what else.

20:25.525 --> 20:30.229
Hey, you guys live
around here, right?

20:30.229 --> 20:31.631
Yeah.
Yeah.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.301
You see anybody using
a Beretta?

20:34.301 --> 20:37.337
Trying to sell one,
anything like that?

20:37.337 --> 20:39.872
What's a Breaduh?

20:39.872 --> 20:42.208
It's a gun, dipstick.
A very expensive one.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.376
(laughing)

20:44.877 --> 20:47.814
Oh, I see. It's gonna
go like that, huh?

20:47.814 --> 20:50.983
Oh, well, thanks
for giving a shit.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.352
Whatever.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.987
It's a traffic cam across
from the mini-mart.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.856
It doesn't get the store, but
it gets this image right after.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.491
We get a clear shot
of the plates?

20:58.491 --> 21:00.993
Oh, it's
better. Just...

21:00.993 --> 21:03.363
Is that Little Eddie?
The one doing the driving?

21:03.363 --> 21:05.432
No, just keep
watching. Watch.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.937
Oh! Hello.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.606
What is this,
Night of the Living Dead?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.141
The guy takes a bull's-eye
to the chest,

21:15.141 --> 21:19.111
and he's walking away
like he scraped his knee?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.213
Kevlar.
Mm-hmm.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.982
It's the only explanation.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.585
Bangers are wearing
bullet-proof vests.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.389
(knocking)

21:31.157 --> 21:32.992
(footfalls approaching)

21:35.294 --> 21:36.596
Ma'am, is
everything okay?

21:36.596 --> 21:39.031
(gasping)
See?

21:39.031 --> 21:44.170
You dialed 911, and these
nice men came to help us.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.638
That's how it works.

21:45.638 --> 21:49.241
If you ever have a problem
or anything bad happens to you

21:49.241 --> 21:51.678
or mommy, you just dial 911.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.048
So, let me get this straight.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.984
You just dialed 911,

21:57.984 --> 22:01.554
so you could teach
your daughter how to use it.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.424
Of course. How else
is she going to learn?

22:04.424 --> 22:06.993
Well, no offense, ma'am...

22:06.993 --> 22:09.662
but you have your head
up your friggin' ass.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.169
(door slams)

22:17.169 --> 22:19.305
We just got screwed.

22:19.305 --> 22:20.640
What?

22:20.640 --> 22:23.943
Call 911. Make a cop come.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.146
(crowd shouting angrily)
Calm down!

22:27.146 --> 22:29.849
You need to calm down!

22:32.218 --> 22:33.953
One at a time, people!

22:35.054 --> 22:36.489
Listen up!

22:36.489 --> 22:37.957
Listen up!

22:37.957 --> 22:39.559
Hey! Hey, listen up!

22:39.559 --> 22:42.462
Quit hassling the sergeant
and settle down, all right?

22:42.462 --> 22:43.730
Who the hell are you?
Yeah, who are you?!

22:43.730 --> 22:45.965
I'm Detective Salinger,

22:45.965 --> 22:48.701
and I'm going to explain
something to you, all right?

22:48.701 --> 22:51.103
We're here
because you need us here.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.238
You need us to protect you!

22:52.238 --> 22:54.541
And serve! What about "serve"?!

22:54.541 --> 22:56.843
That's the way it works, people.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.678
It's the way it
works, all right?

22:58.678 --> 22:59.979
You bring this on yourselves

22:59.979 --> 23:02.048
because you enable
them, all right?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.517
There are....
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.852
There are rules to this game,

23:05.852 --> 23:08.387
and there are lines
that cannot get crossed.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.756
(shouting angrily)

23:11.758 --> 23:13.960
DESK SERGEANT:
We're not getting
anywhere if you...

23:15.728 --> 23:17.697
I'm as black as you are.
Now, step back!

23:22.168 --> 23:23.936
Here's all we've got

23:23.936 --> 23:25.337
on it so far.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.739
Thanks.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.041
Got a little carried
away out there, huh?

23:29.041 --> 23:31.343
(sighing):
Sorry.

23:31.343 --> 23:34.080
How's your nose?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.649
It's better.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.988
Gone a little too
far, hasn't it?

23:41.988 --> 23:44.423
Shots fired, possible assault
rifle, abandoned building,

23:44.423 --> 23:45.758
corner of 88th and Rosecrans.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.226
Gang members seen
fleeing the premises.

23:47.226 --> 23:51.263
You guys go, I got
to talk to someone, all right?

23:51.263 --> 23:54.200
Ready, sweetie?
Let's do it.

23:58.304 --> 23:59.639
Captain?

23:59.639 --> 24:01.007
Got a second?

24:03.242 --> 24:05.578
'Cause I was hoping
you could explain to me why,

24:05.578 --> 24:07.680
in the middle of the night,

24:07.680 --> 24:11.217
your detectives put together
a misdemeanor task force

24:11.217 --> 24:14.153
to harass the neighborhood.

24:14.153 --> 24:17.223
Bryant and Moretta are just
doing what they're told, sir.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.390
By me. They're good men

24:18.390 --> 24:19.826
with respect for authority.

24:19.826 --> 24:23.295
I got into a TA last night.

24:23.295 --> 24:27.634
I was run off the road by some
bangers in a chase of some sort,

24:27.634 --> 24:29.536
They sent me into a light post.

24:29.536 --> 24:32.338
When I came to, my gun was gone.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.373
You file a report?

24:34.373 --> 24:35.708
I got my best men on it.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.976
They're canvassing the area,

24:36.976 --> 24:39.045
hoping to retrieve
my weapon quickly.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.013
You file a report?

24:43.115 --> 24:45.017
No, sir.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.619
(sighing)

24:46.619 --> 24:47.987
Where's
your service vehicle now?

24:47.987 --> 24:50.222
I had it towed. Fixing
it on my own dime.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.390
Was alcohol involved?

24:51.390 --> 24:54.193
I had a couple of drinks.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.361
I was not drunk, though.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.829
The bad judgment
that I exercised

24:56.829 --> 24:58.898
happened after the accident,
not before.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.669
You got 12 hours.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.137
Otherwise, full report
and investigation.

25:06.372 --> 25:09.241
Thank you, sir.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.677
Sal?

25:10.677 --> 25:12.411
Don't ever let anything
like this happen again.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.114
Or else I'll have to see to it
that you lose your badge, too.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.018
Yes, sir.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.056
How you doing?

25:24.056 --> 25:25.224
Good. How are you?

25:25.224 --> 25:26.993
This way.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.728
Bangers usually like
to hang out here,

25:28.728 --> 25:31.931
party, smoke dope, get laid.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.000
This time, it looks like
it was target practice.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.968
Any IDs?

25:35.968 --> 25:38.571
Half a dozen male blacks.
That's it.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.173
Look all the way through.

25:43.509 --> 25:45.645
SAMMY::
Are you kidding me?

25:46.813 --> 25:48.715
It went through two walls?

25:48.715 --> 25:50.783
FEMALE PATROL:
Mm-hmm.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.418
What caliber are
we talking here?

25:52.418 --> 25:56.589
7.62 millimeter.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.791
Belt-fed, armor-piercing rounds.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.093
What the hell takes
a bullet that size?

26:01.093 --> 26:02.895
Definitely nothing
that's legal here.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.235
Hey.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.903
What are you doing here?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.272
What, are you
stalking me now?

26:13.272 --> 26:15.107
Am I what?

26:15.107 --> 26:17.076
Hi. I'm Mia Sanchez.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.344
I'm a reporter.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.079
Yeah, well, there's
nothing to report here,

26:20.079 --> 26:23.816
so take your camera man and
go find some real news.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.084
I'll be right back.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.053
What the hell
is wrong with you, huh?

26:27.053 --> 26:29.689
Why are you acting
like such a jerk?

26:29.689 --> 26:31.991
Why am I acting like a jerk?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.660
Yeah.

26:38.064 --> 26:41.734
This is where I work. You've
got no business being here.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.135
Are you kidding me?

26:43.135 --> 26:45.471
There are people practically
rioting downstairs.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.639
Shh! Keep your voice down.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.275
The entire community
is in an uproar,

26:49.275 --> 26:52.011
and you guys are cracking down
like some kind of invading army.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.080
Well, maybe there's
a good reason for that.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.348
Oh, yeah? Like what?
I don't want to
do this. Not here.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.718
Not now. Okay?

26:58.718 --> 27:01.220
Take your cameraman
and get out of here.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.397
I'm a member
of the earth.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.233
That's about it.

27:14.233 --> 27:18.604
Okay. Well, do you have
any earthling friends

27:18.604 --> 27:20.572
who drive a black Monte Carlo?

27:20.572 --> 27:22.842
'Cause we've got some
surveillance tape that puts you

27:22.842 --> 27:25.712
in said vehicle.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.013
Not that I know of.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.148
Listen, Kato, have you noticed

27:29.148 --> 27:32.284
all your boys being
cuffed lately?
(chuckles)

27:32.284 --> 27:34.153
Huh? Have you?

27:34.153 --> 27:35.688
That's going
to keep happening

27:35.688 --> 27:39.491
until we get
what we're looking for.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.894
Well, what you
looking for, then?
A gun.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.830
A very special gun.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.632
Like, uh, rare special?

27:46.632 --> 27:48.100
Sort of, yeah.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.170
Put holes in concrete walls
special?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.806
Yeah.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.508
Sure.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.410
It's a big gun.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.013
So big, a little guy
like yourself

28:01.013 --> 28:02.381
probably couldn't handle it.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.716
I'm strong. I lift.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.451
Oh, yeah?
Really?

28:05.451 --> 28:09.756
What, like five-four?
130 pounds soaking wet?

28:09.756 --> 28:11.423
Hell, no. five-six, man.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.826
And that thing gave me
no trouble whatso...

28:16.295 --> 28:17.529
Yeah, I got that.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.965
So, HCC is involved
in both the mini-mart

28:18.965 --> 28:20.132
and the warehouse shooting.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.568
Yeah, it's looking that way.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.071
All right. Tell you what.
Let's get association warrants,

28:25.071 --> 28:28.007
smoke every one of them punks
out of their rat holes.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.608
All due respect, Sal,

28:29.608 --> 28:31.978
you do know the brass is going
to ask about that, right?

28:31.978 --> 28:34.013
He knows.
He's giving me 12 hours

28:34.013 --> 28:35.782
before I have to go
through proper channels.

28:35.782 --> 28:38.017
How did he find out?

28:38.017 --> 28:41.520
I told him. Everything.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.756
I don't know. You guys are good,
all right? You're golden.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.892
All right, man. Thanks.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.130
Hi, yo, Mr. Policeman?
Yes?

28:51.130 --> 28:53.099
So this is how I'm
repaid for my cooperation?

28:53.099 --> 28:55.802
Top of the morning, sir.
How can I be of service today?

28:55.802 --> 28:57.669
Look, man, I had to
have six men lift my ass

28:57.669 --> 29:00.106
up into my mother's
minivan just to come here.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.341
Just the six?
Big Wayne. How you doing?

29:02.341 --> 29:03.742
There a problem?

29:03.742 --> 29:04.844
Yeah. Y'all impounded
my Escalade

29:04.844 --> 29:06.512
right out of my driveway.

29:06.512 --> 29:09.181
Gee, I'm sorry about that.
I don't know how that happened.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.583
Look man, it had my
ramp and my Bible in it.

29:11.583 --> 29:15.154
Except, we are getting serious
about unpaid parking tickets.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.289
Do you have any
unpaid tickets, sir?

29:17.289 --> 29:18.257
Look, man.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.725
Damn them tickets, all right?

29:19.725 --> 29:21.460
I want my damn car back.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.062
Let's get up out of here.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.735
I'm guessing the man's
got more than one ride.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.037
Yeah.

29:31.037 --> 29:35.207
But that one
does have his Bible in it.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.013
I love the smell of
impound yards in the morning.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.891
How much you think a CD weighs?

29:51.891 --> 29:55.794
Not much. Why?

29:55.794 --> 29:58.197
This guy's record company must
be doing brisk business.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.900
He's got about $10,000
in shipping receipts here.

30:04.570 --> 30:05.872
Hey.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.473
Not a one.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.875
Where is everybody?

30:08.875 --> 30:10.877
They're laying low.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.811
We'll find them.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.513
Just keep looking,
all right?

30:14.513 --> 30:15.747
(engine starting)

30:15.747 --> 30:17.583
All right.

30:20.619 --> 30:23.189
Excuse me, sir?

30:23.189 --> 30:26.592
Sir! We're looking
for Casper Tillman.
What?

30:26.592 --> 30:29.195
I got a warrant for Casper
Tillman. Any idea where he's at?

30:29.195 --> 30:32.631
Place fool's gonna be himself,
if he keeps it up. Funeral.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.500
Funeral.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.202
Can you tell me
where it's at?

30:36.202 --> 30:37.937
What?

30:37.937 --> 30:41.040
Who's fucking
Dennis? Who is that?

30:41.040 --> 30:42.774
Hey. What's up?

30:42.774 --> 30:43.943
Come in for a
fucking tattoo,

30:43.943 --> 30:45.277
this is what he does.

30:47.746 --> 30:48.814
So, what?

30:48.814 --> 30:50.649
I told him to put "Denise."

30:50.649 --> 30:52.151
He mumbled it.
Shut the fuck up.

30:52.151 --> 30:56.388
So, you wanted Denise
and he put Dennis.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.191
This is why you
called the police?

30:59.191 --> 31:02.428
I look like a faggot to you?

31:02.428 --> 31:05.932
I don't know. What's
a faggot look like?

31:07.033 --> 31:08.700
You fucking
with me?

31:08.700 --> 31:09.969
Kind of.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.485
(groans, slaps floor)

31:26.485 --> 31:28.955
(panting hard)

31:28.955 --> 31:31.090
Where'd you learn that?

31:31.991 --> 31:34.060
Summer camp.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.495
(wry laugh)

31:36.495 --> 31:37.763
(pants, grunts)

31:37.763 --> 31:40.066
Told you... whew!

31:40.066 --> 31:41.833
The whole day--

31:41.833 --> 31:43.970
nothing but garbage calls.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.804
Whoo-ooh.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.173
(sighing):
Yeah...

31:57.083 --> 31:58.584
Whose funeral?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.819
PFC Derek Thompson.
Enlisted right out
of high school.

32:00.819 --> 32:02.488
Thompson?

32:02.488 --> 32:05.391
Isn't that the gangbanger used
to go by the name of Pook?

32:05.391 --> 32:08.594
I busted that piece of crap
on five different misdemeanors.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.965
SAL:
Who's that sitting down?

32:12.965 --> 32:14.967
NATE:
I'll be damned.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.936
Looks like Big Wayne
hitched a ride.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.538
SAL:
Big Wayne.

32:19.538 --> 32:23.375
NATE: At least we know
where all our bangers are.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.181
What's going on
with that?

32:31.984 --> 32:34.120
What's up?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.724
I don't feel comfortable
with what we're doing...

32:38.724 --> 32:41.193
Don't feel comfortable
with what we're doing.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.961
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

32:42.961 --> 32:44.730
We're doing our jobs.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.232
Our freakin' jobs?
Dragging people in

32:46.232 --> 32:47.966
on bullshit charges?
That's our job?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.368
We're onto
something big here.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.936
If hadn't been looking
for Sal's gun,

32:50.936 --> 32:53.005
we never would've stumbled on
to this other thing.

32:53.005 --> 32:56.308
We're gonna hit
the jackpot here!

32:56.308 --> 32:58.310
And that justifies everything
we're doing, right?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.279
Busting up the freakin'
neighborhood

33:00.279 --> 33:01.447
'cause Sal messed up.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.082
We're better
than that, man.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.683
This isn't Rampart.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.386
We're not planting guns...
and-and-and shooting people!

33:07.386 --> 33:09.155
It's a slippery
slope, bro!

33:09.155 --> 33:10.422
Whose team are you on?

33:10.422 --> 33:12.591
What teams?
There are teams now?

33:12.591 --> 33:16.262
Maybe we went
a little overboard.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.864
But put yourself
in his position.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.266
I wouldn't be
in his position.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.101
I forgot who
I was talking to.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.070
Mr. Perfect.

33:24.070 --> 33:28.274
I'm far from perfect, bro.

33:28.274 --> 33:30.076
How was your day?

33:30.076 --> 33:32.511
Not bad. Yours?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.913
Mm... mm.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.782
Alarm company came out.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.985
Said there was a spider stuck
in the hall motion detector.

33:39.985 --> 33:42.254
Really?

33:42.254 --> 33:43.489
That's all that
was triggering it?

33:43.489 --> 33:44.690
Yep.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.358
MAN (in distance):
...just shut the hell up.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.060
WOMAN:
I'm not the one
doing the yelling.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.096
You're the one who's always
slamming around this place

33:50.096 --> 33:51.363
in a crappy mood.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.864
MAN:
Because you won't stop bitching!

33:52.864 --> 33:55.601
It was a lot more pleasant
when I worked nights, huh?

33:55.601 --> 33:56.935
For you, maybe.

33:56.935 --> 34:00.072
Trying writing when you
live next-door to that.

34:00.072 --> 34:02.541
Guess it'd be kind of
hard to concentrate.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.143
(argument continues
indistinctly)

34:04.143 --> 34:06.145
You know,
it's gotten worse lately.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.281
Between them.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.384
Sal, we finally got detail
on these shipping statements

34:12.384 --> 34:13.485
we got out of
Big Wayne's Escalade.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.854
They're all paid in cash.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.123
(Sal groans)

34:17.123 --> 34:20.092
Look like shipments from
every major company.

34:20.092 --> 34:23.195
Originating addresses
North Carolina,

34:23.195 --> 34:25.097
Texas, Georgia...

34:25.097 --> 34:26.098
NATE:
What cities?

34:26.098 --> 34:28.534
Uh, Kileen, Fayetteville...

34:28.534 --> 34:30.068
There are two Columbuses?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.970
NATE: One in Ohio,
the other's in Georgia.

34:31.970 --> 34:34.906
Fort Benning.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.376
These are all cities
near U.S. Army bases.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.811
SAL: We got a dozen local
addresses here, gentlemen,

34:39.811 --> 34:42.514
and they're receiving
shipments from those cities.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.083
Looks like Big Wayne didn't want
anything sent to him direct.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.786
Kenny, come with me.
Yep.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.962
House right there...
Yeah.

34:56.962 --> 35:00.065
...belongs to Miss Sally
Hightower, 90 years young.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.501
Outlived all of her relatives.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.403
Told me
the secret to a long life

35:04.403 --> 35:06.672
is prayer
and a good rocking chair.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.474
Problem?

35:08.474 --> 35:11.810
Yeah.
She's almost always in it.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.512
(knocking on door)

35:14.580 --> 35:16.148
Yeah?

35:16.148 --> 35:17.216
SAL:
Miss Hightower here?

35:17.216 --> 35:19.050
No.

35:19.050 --> 35:20.319
Seems a little strange,

35:20.319 --> 35:22.854
being that she lives here
and all.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.624
You mind if I come in?
She's a good friend of mine.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.360
Actually, we kind
of busy right now.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.095
Hey! Don't you got a search
warrant or something?

35:30.095 --> 35:32.398
No, just a badge.
Back off.

35:32.398 --> 35:33.965
KENNY: All right, that's it.
That's it. Come on.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.001
No... get down
on the ground.
Sit down. Down.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.068
Hands behind your back.

35:37.068 --> 35:38.904
Both hands.
Come on.
18-W-35

35:38.904 --> 35:41.072
requesting backup
at 433 Estrella.
Stay still,
right where you are.

35:41.072 --> 35:43.209
Call in and get a warrant
for the boxes.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.411
Miss Hightower,
can you hear me?

35:45.411 --> 35:48.013
(weakly):
I'm here...
Miss Hightower!

35:48.013 --> 35:50.716
Don't you move...

35:50.716 --> 35:51.917
Miss Hightower?

35:51.917 --> 35:53.084
(weakly):
I'm here...

35:53.084 --> 35:54.520
SAL:
Miss Hightower,
are you here?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.188
HIGHTOWER:
I'm here with the brooms.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.428
Oh, my God...

36:04.396 --> 36:06.532
SAL:
All right...

36:06.532 --> 36:08.900
Go slow, go slow.
I got ya.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.769
Stay steady.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.371
I got ya.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.941
You gave her a can
to crap in?

36:15.941 --> 36:19.378
SAMMY: We have a record
of shipments from Alvin Carter

36:19.378 --> 36:22.180
and Dalane Morris,
both alleged HCC members

36:22.180 --> 36:24.350
who are currently
in the Army.

36:24.350 --> 36:27.018
Stationed at Fort Hood
and Fort Bragg, respectively.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.088
Looks like Big Wayne's
creating his own damn army.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.123
Do we have enough?

36:32.123 --> 36:33.091
Hell, yeah.

36:33.091 --> 36:34.626
Let's go get 'em.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.661
Do it.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.264
Everybody down!

36:38.264 --> 36:41.099
(officers all shouting
commands at once)

36:41.099 --> 36:42.368
Drop! On the ground!

36:42.368 --> 36:43.669
On the ground!

36:43.669 --> 36:45.737
(shouting continues)
Down! Down! Down!

36:45.737 --> 36:47.406
Get down on the
ground now!

36:47.406 --> 36:49.475
Down! Down! Now!
Get down!

36:49.475 --> 36:51.510
Down! Do not move.
Don't move! Don't move!

36:51.510 --> 36:54.413
I can't motherfucker!
I'm paralyzed!

36:54.413 --> 36:56.782
Hands on top of your head!
Face the wall! Face the wall!

36:56.782 --> 36:58.350
Search warrant.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.352
(knocking on door)

37:00.352 --> 37:01.987
LYDIA:
I've got it, Ma!

37:05.324 --> 37:06.992
Stanley?

37:06.992 --> 37:10.161
I was processed and
released on my own
recognizance.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.397
I see that.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.265
At least I hope that.

37:13.265 --> 37:16.167
You were very kind
to me today.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.036
Treated me
with real dignity.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.238
Understanding.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.908
(latch clicks)

37:22.908 --> 37:25.043
Stanley, what are
you doing here?

37:25.043 --> 37:26.645
I am getting help.

37:26.645 --> 37:30.215
And with medication,
it's controllable.

37:30.215 --> 37:31.917
No, that sounds wrong.

37:31.917 --> 37:36.187
No... the drugs won't
impact my romantic capacity,

37:36.187 --> 37:38.324
just my behavioral
compulsions.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.692
Stanley...
Anyway, I was just thinking...

37:40.692 --> 37:43.395
do you want to have
a cup of coffee sometime?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.978
Got a present for you.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.559
(sighs)

38:13.559 --> 38:14.860
Where'd you find it?

38:14.860 --> 38:17.195
Kid turned it in.

38:17.195 --> 38:18.630
The pressure worked.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.301
Thanks, guys.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.437
I owe you.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.913
What happened here?

39:10.081 --> 39:11.850
A UFO crash-landed, ma'am.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.653
Now we're gonna need you
to keep moving.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.102
Hi.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.504
I left a message for you.

39:32.504 --> 39:35.373
Yeah. I know.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.449
Mia, we can't
do this anymore.

39:43.449 --> 39:46.452
Sorry?

39:46.452 --> 39:49.054
We're done, okay?

39:51.723 --> 39:53.459
I... I don't understand.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.660
It's just...

39:55.794 --> 39:59.731
There's lines;
lines that just...

39:59.731 --> 40:01.099
can't be crossed.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.974
You take care of yourself,
all right?

40:29.260 --> 40:32.430
You and Mariella
have big plans?

40:32.430 --> 40:33.465
What, for tonight?

40:33.465 --> 40:35.133
Mm-hmm.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.102
Just gonna sleep.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.510
You a cop
when you met her?

40:44.510 --> 40:47.679
Nah, I was a private.

40:47.679 --> 40:50.015
I was a stoner
when I met Tammi.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.349
(laughing)

40:51.349 --> 40:52.684
What, are you serious?

40:52.684 --> 40:55.554
Stoned all through
high school.
Wow.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.355
Just hanging
with my friends.

40:57.355 --> 40:58.924
Was Tammi
part of that group?

40:58.924 --> 41:00.592
My wife is not
a group person.

41:00.592 --> 41:04.095
She doesn't...
get the team mentality.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.933
That's her loss.

41:10.168 --> 41:12.237
You ever smoked weed?

41:15.306 --> 41:17.242
No.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.315
(laughs)

41:24.315 --> 41:25.917
Yeah, I didn't think so.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.554
(laughs)
