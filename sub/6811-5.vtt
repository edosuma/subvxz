WEBVTT

00:03.724 --> 00:07.809
So, what do I have to do
to get you to, you know,

00:07.811 --> 00:09.478
to go out with me?

00:09.480 --> 00:13.315
What do you call this?

00:13.317 --> 00:15.317
Being neighborly.

00:17.655 --> 00:19.738
I'm taking about a real date, Maria.

00:19.740 --> 00:23.325
We both get dolled up, I take you out.

00:23.645 --> 00:27.079
Dinner, dancing. People still do that?

00:27.081 --> 00:29.248
Yeah, the old-fashioned ones.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.083
Those are my favorite kind.

00:31.085 --> 00:33.218
I like that about you.

00:42.730 --> 00:45.597
Where'd you go?

00:45.599 --> 00:48.850
Sorry. I just...

00:48.852 --> 00:50.519
A memory. It's nothing.

00:50.521 --> 00:53.355
The last time I got close to a guy,

00:53.357 --> 00:55.357
it didn't work out too well.

00:55.359 --> 00:58.277
Okay. Tell me.

00:58.279 --> 01:00.862
Um...

01:00.864 --> 01:04.750
Back in Memphis.

01:04.751 --> 01:07.869
He was the only man I ever really loved.

01:07.871 --> 01:10.038
I lost him.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.709
Only a fool would leave you.

01:13.711 --> 01:16.461
It wasn't like that.

01:18.882 --> 01:20.882
He was murdered.

01:20.884 --> 01:22.217
Oh, my God.

01:23.721 --> 01:25.437
Did they ever catch the killer?

01:31.061 --> 01:32.894
Abigail!

01:38.319 --> 01:40.786
So, what about you?

01:40.788 --> 01:43.155
I had a girl.

01:43.157 --> 01:45.123
Met her when I was at infantry school.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.325
You loved her?

01:46.327 --> 01:48.660
Very much. Yeah.

01:48.662 --> 01:52.831
- What happened?
- Car accident.

01:52.833 --> 01:56.001
It's hard to keep going above ground

01:56.003 --> 01:57.919
when the ones you love are below.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.341
But, you know,

02:02.343 --> 02:06.011
I'm ready to spend some time with someone.

02:06.013 --> 02:08.930
I'd like to, and I want to,

02:08.931 --> 02:11.984
but I'm just not ready yet.

02:11.986 --> 02:14.319
Until I can make peace with myself,

02:14.321 --> 02:16.021
I'm not good for anyone else.

02:16.023 --> 02:18.857
All right.

02:18.859 --> 02:21.994
I'm a patient man.

02:21.996 --> 02:23.445
Okay?

02:27.368 --> 02:28.700
To patience?

02:30.704 --> 02:34.339
We spend so much of our
lives building up walls,

02:34.341 --> 02:36.508
trying to keep people out.

02:36.510 --> 02:39.628
Afraid if they could see
what we really are inside,

02:39.630 --> 02:42.798
they might turn away in horror.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.218
But maybe we're more afraid
of what happens if they don't.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.553
Hey, Lucy. Can you grab me a beer?

02:48.555 --> 02:50.555
Luce, you here?

02:50.557 --> 02:53.225
89 degrees. Partial clearing tonight

02:53.227 --> 02:55.060
with a low of 74.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.984
Oh.

03:02.986 --> 03:06.488
Oh, you feel so good.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.741
Oh, so much better than my husband.

03:09.743 --> 03:11.877
Lucy?

03:16.216 --> 03:17.416
What the hell do you
mean you're out of stock?

03:17.418 --> 03:18.834
A temporary setback.

03:18.836 --> 03:20.419
Those Society of Sons of bitches

03:20.421 --> 03:22.220
interrupted my flow of product.

03:22.222 --> 03:23.755
But you can red-light your distress,

03:23.757 --> 03:26.091
'cause that situation
is being rectified duly.

03:26.093 --> 03:27.592
What the hell did he just say?

03:27.594 --> 03:29.511
We're getting our business back on its feet

03:29.513 --> 03:31.430
and you're gonna need to be patient.

03:31.432 --> 03:34.566
Patient? You're the only game in town now.

03:34.568 --> 03:36.685
After the crazy shit I've seen lately,

03:36.687 --> 03:38.403
you'd need something to
take the edge off too.

03:38.405 --> 03:40.105
Come back tomorrow, beautiful lady,

03:40.107 --> 03:41.857
and we'll have everything you need.

03:41.859 --> 03:45.110
But if you need to release
some endorphins before them,

03:45.112 --> 03:47.612
I know some other ways
to make you feel good.

03:50.617 --> 03:53.118
Sorry, daddy's got me on curfew.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.591
Some people have no self-control.

05:17.562 --> 05:20.314
Grace, before we go any further,

05:20.316 --> 05:22.266
are you sure you're ready for this?

05:22.268 --> 05:24.268
Yeah. Why?

05:24.270 --> 05:29.273
I've never met anyone
like you before in my life.

05:29.275 --> 05:31.992
The minute you came back, I felt it, Grace.

05:31.994 --> 05:36.363
You are the most perfect
thing I have ever seen.

05:38.618 --> 05:40.334
And I just don't want to mess that up.

05:45.875 --> 05:47.291
What do you mean?

05:49.846 --> 05:52.179
You know what?

05:52.181 --> 05:54.882
I almost got you killed the other day.

05:56.219 --> 05:58.886
You saved my life.

06:01.974 --> 06:05.226
Look, I can decide for myself

06:05.228 --> 06:08.028
who and what is good for me or not.

06:09.565 --> 06:13.067
- Hmm. Hmm? Hmm?
- Hmm?

06:17.490 --> 06:20.574
Mmm.

06:22.161 --> 06:23.577
What?

06:26.048 --> 06:28.549
It's Maria.

06:28.551 --> 06:30.918
She's probably waiting
for me at Frogmore's.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.837
I got a lead on another job.

06:32.839 --> 06:35.339
Guy's supposed to meet
us there after breakfast.

06:35.341 --> 06:36.924
♪ Frogmore's pancakes. ♪

06:38.261 --> 06:39.810
Why you eating my food?

06:39.812 --> 06:41.345
You have your own.

06:41.347 --> 06:42.813
I know, but yours looks better.

06:42.815 --> 06:45.149
Well, it is better because it's mine.

06:47.236 --> 06:48.652
What's got you in such a good mood?

06:48.654 --> 06:49.987
Oh, I'm not.

06:49.989 --> 06:52.156
Mmm.

06:52.158 --> 06:53.908
Excuse me for interrupting.
I know I'm early.

06:53.910 --> 06:56.110
I went by your booth
but you were not there.

06:56.112 --> 06:57.912
Can I?

06:57.914 --> 07:01.499
- You're the guy who called me?
- My name is Terence Clay.

07:01.501 --> 07:03.534
My... there's something wrong with my wife.

07:03.536 --> 07:06.086
She's doing unspeakable things with men.

07:06.088 --> 07:08.005
Strangers. Sins of the flesh.

07:08.007 --> 07:10.457
Look, Mr. Clay, just because your wife

07:10.459 --> 07:12.293
is cheating on you doesn't
mean that she's possessed.

07:12.295 --> 07:13.844
No, no. You don't understand. Okay?

07:13.846 --> 07:15.963
My wife is the true believer.

07:15.965 --> 07:17.798
She's the pious one. Okay?

07:17.800 --> 07:20.384
Even when the Devil tempted me
into the arms of other women,

07:20.386 --> 07:23.103
she forgave me and she's meek.

07:23.105 --> 07:24.605
That was her strength.

07:24.607 --> 07:26.357
Maybe she's tired of being a doormat.

07:26.359 --> 07:28.526
He's right. Excuse us.

07:28.528 --> 07:30.227
This isn't the kind of
thing I can help you with.

07:30.229 --> 07:31.979
She's making me watch.

07:31.981 --> 07:36.233
What do you mean?

07:36.235 --> 07:38.986
It's happening. It's happening again.

07:38.988 --> 07:40.487
Lucy. Wedding ring.

07:40.489 --> 07:42.072
That's... that's... That is my wife.

07:42.074 --> 07:44.241
- Her hands are all over him.
- Calm down.

07:44.243 --> 07:45.876
She's tying his hands together.

07:45.878 --> 07:46.877
She's tying his hands together!

07:46.879 --> 07:48.546
Shh.

07:48.548 --> 07:49.880
- Calm down, Mr. Clay.
- It's a m... it's a motel.

07:49.882 --> 07:50.915
It's a motel.

07:50.917 --> 07:53.667
Do you see a name?

07:53.669 --> 07:55.302
Para-Dice.

07:55.304 --> 07:58.055
She's in Para-Dice!

07:58.057 --> 08:01.809
Para-Dice?

08:07.934 --> 08:09.934
Hey. I need to talk to you.

08:09.936 --> 08:12.937
- Where were you this morning?
- That's my business.

08:12.939 --> 08:15.239
You need to stay away from the Abascals.

08:15.241 --> 08:16.824
Why?

08:16.826 --> 08:20.327
These are dangerous
people, especially David.

08:20.329 --> 08:22.529
But they're good enough to
help fight your holy war,

08:22.531 --> 08:24.081
just not good enough for me.

08:24.083 --> 08:27.868
Maria and David are not like you and me.

08:27.870 --> 08:29.503
You know who their father was.

08:29.505 --> 08:33.123
So? Lanie Parsing said I
was the daughter of a whore.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.924
Does that make me bad too?

08:34.927 --> 08:36.677
It's not true.

08:36.679 --> 08:39.346
Stop lying to me!

08:39.347 --> 08:40.547
I went online.

08:40.549 --> 08:41.932
I found the newspaper articles

08:41.933 --> 08:44.602
about what happened at that nightclub.

08:44.604 --> 08:47.688
The place you shot Dean Parsing's
father wasn't just a bar.

08:47.690 --> 08:50.474
It was a brothel.

08:50.476 --> 08:55.029
Claire was a special woman.

08:55.031 --> 08:57.364
Just like you.

08:57.366 --> 09:00.901
Then who was she?

09:00.903 --> 09:04.121
All these crazy things are happening to me.

09:04.123 --> 09:05.956
I need to know the truth
about where I came from.

09:05.958 --> 09:07.958
Where you came from.

09:15.584 --> 09:19.920
Gracie, you are here now,

09:19.922 --> 09:22.840
and that's all that matters.

09:25.011 --> 09:29.013
Stay away from the Abascals.

09:36.188 --> 09:39.406
What happened? How can I help?

09:39.408 --> 09:40.691
You can't.

09:43.663 --> 09:44.828
How long have you had that?

09:50.286 --> 09:52.586
You think this guy's for real?

09:52.588 --> 09:54.505
He thinks it's real. I'm sure of that much.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.458
- I don't know.
- Mr. Clay?

09:57.460 --> 10:00.127
What's up?

10:00.129 --> 10:02.713
He's out. Those visions
must leave him wasted.

10:02.715 --> 10:04.431
Lucy.

10:04.433 --> 10:07.935
Ooh. Pancake party.

10:07.937 --> 10:09.353
Pancake party.

10:09.355 --> 10:11.438
What's with you this morning?

10:11.440 --> 10:12.973
What do you mean?

10:12.975 --> 10:14.942
You're dragging our asses across town

10:14.944 --> 10:18.278
looking for Don Juan's wife and
you're breaking out into song.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.315
I'm just in a good mood.

10:21.317 --> 10:24.735
It's not dope. I swear.

10:24.737 --> 10:26.487
- Just be careful, David.
- No way.

10:26.489 --> 10:28.038
I've seen you with Grace.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.623
She's not like Charlotte.

10:29.625 --> 10:30.991
Can't you just be happy for me?

10:40.469 --> 10:43.637
What is it? Shit.

10:43.639 --> 10:45.422
Looks like a wild night gone bad.

10:45.424 --> 10:46.974
Maybe, but I don't think your average stiff

10:46.976 --> 10:48.308
has eyes like that.

10:49.929 --> 10:52.346
Come on. We can't be seen here.

10:52.348 --> 10:53.647
We can't be a part of this.

10:53.649 --> 10:54.815
Not if there's a body.

11:12.334 --> 11:13.500
A book.

11:13.502 --> 11:16.120
Look. See that?

11:16.122 --> 11:18.038
I don't understand the
text. What does it mean?

11:18.040 --> 11:21.542
The rune is the mark of an angel.

11:21.544 --> 11:23.677
Of an...

11:23.679 --> 11:25.262
She's flesh and blood.

11:25.264 --> 11:27.714
Mine. I saw her born.

11:27.716 --> 11:31.635
You also saw what happened
the other night with Maria.

11:31.637 --> 11:33.270
I mean...

11:33.272 --> 11:36.140
how else can you explain it?

11:36.142 --> 11:37.724
Look, this book.

11:37.726 --> 11:38.976
Where did it come from?

11:38.978 --> 11:40.978
I stole it when I left Sangolo.

11:40.980 --> 11:43.230
From his own library.

11:43.232 --> 11:44.698
Enos' word?

11:44.700 --> 11:46.533
It is not the word of God.

11:46.535 --> 11:50.487
- Christianity, Islam, Judaism, it doesn't matter.
- It is not.

11:50.489 --> 11:52.823
All those religions kill
in the name of their god,

11:52.825 --> 11:56.243
but even the bloodiest
soil can still bear fruit.

11:56.245 --> 11:59.463
I'm talking about saving a soul.

11:59.465 --> 12:03.050
If I have to use the Devil's
tools to do good, then I will.

12:03.052 --> 12:04.334
Do you understand?

12:04.336 --> 12:08.222
Grace is an angel.

12:08.224 --> 12:11.341
I don't mean a sweetheart
or a... or a good girl.

12:11.343 --> 12:16.763
I mean she is an actual angel.

12:16.765 --> 12:18.682
A miracle in the flesh.

12:18.684 --> 12:21.018
Tetra.

12:21.020 --> 12:24.488
Why would that scare you?

12:24.490 --> 12:26.156
She's my daughter.

12:26.158 --> 12:27.858
She's a miracle to me already.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.495
I don't need her to be a martyr too.

12:31.497 --> 12:33.530
Elijah, for a man of God,

12:33.532 --> 12:37.534
you have so little faith.

12:37.536 --> 12:41.872
Whatever had gotten
into the pious Mrs. Clay,

12:41.874 --> 12:43.707
one thing was for sure,

12:43.709 --> 12:47.094
She wanted her cheating
husband to know all about it.

12:47.096 --> 12:48.846
Where is she?

12:48.848 --> 12:51.298
I told you, okay? I
don't know where she is.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.550
I can only see her when she's with them.

12:53.552 --> 12:56.436
But I swear I had no
idea she was killing them.

12:56.438 --> 12:58.105
All right, well, then,
you're sticking with us

12:58.107 --> 12:59.890
so we can get to the
next before it's too late.

12:59.892 --> 13:01.975
All right, I'll stay
close, but I need a drink.

13:01.977 --> 13:05.696
Frogmore's.

13:05.698 --> 13:07.397
That guy giving you the creeps too?

13:07.399 --> 13:11.118
Like him or not, something's going on here.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.819
That dead body, though.

13:12.821 --> 13:14.988
Talk about coitus interruptus.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.456
David, cut it out.

13:16.458 --> 13:19.409
We've seen too many bodies lately.

13:19.411 --> 13:22.079
Hey, now, you better be careful with that.

13:22.081 --> 13:24.298
You might poke an eye out.

13:24.300 --> 13:27.084
Thanks for the tip,
Sheriff, but if Mr. Roberts

13:27.086 --> 13:29.386
sent you to tell me to keep
away from his daughter again,

13:29.388 --> 13:30.637
tell him it worked, okay?

13:32.141 --> 13:34.258
Don't flatter yourself, son.

13:34.260 --> 13:36.810
No, I came to talk to Miss Abascal.

13:39.431 --> 13:42.733
- What for?
- Have a seat.

13:42.735 --> 13:44.735
I'm not asking you.

13:49.525 --> 13:53.277
Have you ever spent the
night at the Para-Dice Motel?

13:53.279 --> 13:54.945
- No.
- Hmm.

13:54.947 --> 13:58.582
So, it's unlikely someone
saw your blue pickup

13:58.584 --> 14:00.617
leaving there not too long ago?

14:00.619 --> 14:02.669
It's South Carolina.

14:02.671 --> 14:05.038
Everyone and their
granddaddy owns a blue pickup.

14:07.009 --> 14:08.675
That's right.

14:08.677 --> 14:12.212
Yeah, that truck could
belong to just about anybody.

14:12.214 --> 14:16.516
But that motel gets its share
of weirdoes and shady people.

14:16.518 --> 14:20.020
That's why they put security
cams all over the place.

14:24.393 --> 14:29.730
And I have been watching you
and your brother for awhile now,

14:29.732 --> 14:32.232
and the mess you've
been making in this city.

14:32.234 --> 14:34.651
We found a body over at Cadillac Blacks.

14:34.653 --> 14:36.820
Thought that stiff looked pretty unique,

14:36.822 --> 14:41.491
until we found this guy
with the same problem.

14:44.546 --> 14:47.798
Very soon, that phone is gonna ring.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.802
The DA calling to tell me that I got it.

14:51.804 --> 14:53.804
The indictment I've been hoping for.

14:53.806 --> 14:55.672
To lock you and your brother up

14:55.674 --> 14:58.308
for the rest of your trailer trash lives.

15:02.848 --> 15:06.767
So, I'll ask you one more time.

15:06.769 --> 15:09.987
Have you ever been to the Para-Dice Motel?

15:15.527 --> 15:16.777
Yeah, that's okay.

15:16.779 --> 15:21.415
Save your breath.

15:21.417 --> 15:26.286
Because that face
belongs to nobody but you.

15:31.082 --> 15:33.249
The Sheriff's phone never rang.

15:33.251 --> 15:35.085
That part was a bluff.

15:35.087 --> 15:38.138
Maria, on tape with the
victim hours before he died,

15:38.140 --> 15:40.390
wasn't enough to prove anything.

15:40.392 --> 15:41.758
Yet.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.926
To the law, anyway.

15:42.928 --> 15:44.561
This is ridiculous.

15:44.563 --> 15:46.262
Can't get arrested for
screwing a guy to death.

15:46.264 --> 15:48.264
Abigail, what the hell did you do?

15:48.266 --> 15:49.933
No, it wasn't me.

15:49.935 --> 15:51.735
We both know this
wouldn't be the first time

15:51.737 --> 15:52.769
you pulled something like this.

15:52.771 --> 15:55.238
I'm not pulling anything,

15:55.240 --> 15:57.407
but if that thing walking
around wearing our face

15:57.409 --> 15:58.825
is who I think it is,

15:58.827 --> 16:00.660
then we're gonna need a bigger boat.

16:02.948 --> 16:06.116
Ugh. Hello?

16:06.118 --> 16:08.251
Well, I see your car's here.

16:08.253 --> 16:09.919
Where'd you run off to?

16:09.921 --> 16:11.171
Charlotte...

16:11.173 --> 16:12.922
Now, I know a lot of guys

16:12.924 --> 16:17.127
who stop calling after
they get in a girl's pants,

16:17.129 --> 16:20.346
but after what we went
through at the lake house,

16:20.348 --> 16:23.466
you owe me a text at the very least.

16:23.468 --> 16:25.635
You didn't say anything
to the cops, did you?

16:25.637 --> 16:28.438
You mean about you shooting
a hole through a man?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.974
Or the part about a guy being
okay talking with a knife

16:30.976 --> 16:32.692
through his neck?

16:32.694 --> 16:34.978
Don't worry. I covered your ass.

16:34.980 --> 16:37.781
I guess love makes us do crazy things.

16:37.783 --> 16:41.985
What?

16:41.987 --> 16:44.821
Most guys just get what
they want and they're gone.

16:44.823 --> 16:46.790
You risked your life for me.

16:46.792 --> 16:49.492
Now, how about we meet up
and I'll take care of you?

16:49.494 --> 16:50.994
Uh, I... I can't.

16:50.996 --> 16:53.630
Dickey almost busted Maria. She needs me.

16:53.632 --> 16:54.831
I need you.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.499
I lied to the police for you.

16:56.501 --> 16:58.001
It's happening. It's happening.

16:58.003 --> 17:00.003
- It's happening again.
- Charlotte, look,

17:00.005 --> 17:01.805
I... I don't have time for this right now.

17:01.807 --> 17:04.339
I got bigger problems.

17:04.342 --> 17:09.179
All I need to do is say just
one word to that sheriff.

17:09.181 --> 17:11.146
Don't, Charlotte. Please.

17:11.148 --> 17:13.849
Uh, I... I'll meet you
tonight at Cadillac Black.

17:13.852 --> 17:15.234
It's a date.

17:15.237 --> 17:20.490
Come with me.

17:20.492 --> 17:22.192
He's doing it again.

17:22.194 --> 17:25.078
We need to find this demon fast
or we are both going to prison.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.329
Charlotte is coming after me.

17:27.332 --> 17:28.832
You need to stop mumbling.

17:28.834 --> 17:29.999
You need to speak.

17:30.001 --> 17:31.034
What do you see?

17:31.036 --> 17:32.752
Parking. Parking. Cars.

17:32.754 --> 17:33.870
Jets. Airport.

17:33.872 --> 17:35.255
Airport with long-term parking.

17:35.257 --> 17:36.756
Basement... basement level!

17:43.715 --> 17:46.049
No one's in there.

17:46.051 --> 17:47.717
I'm looking for Gracie.

17:47.719 --> 17:50.220
I haven't seen her come
by since this morning.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.950
Tetra said you were looking
for me the other day.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.957
No, thanks.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.243
I guess I'm having what
a man like you would call

18:13.245 --> 18:17.630
a... a spiritual crisis.

18:17.632 --> 18:22.919
Did something I wish I didn't.

18:22.921 --> 18:24.888
Trust me, that won't help.

18:28.476 --> 18:30.426
You sure?

18:32.430 --> 18:35.565
Aw.

18:35.567 --> 18:38.434
You're a stronger man than me.

18:57.789 --> 18:59.956
You looking for your
husband? He ain't here.

18:59.958 --> 19:03.927
I'm not looking for my husband.

19:03.929 --> 19:05.795
Looking for a job?

19:05.797 --> 19:10.767
No. Uh, my name is Grace Bledsoe.

19:10.769 --> 19:13.636
- Mm-hmm.
- My father is Elijah Bledsoe.

19:13.638 --> 19:16.522
Mm-hmm. So?

19:19.527 --> 19:23.313
He was involved in a situation
that happened here a while back.

19:23.315 --> 19:26.032
- The shooting.
- You a reporter?

19:26.034 --> 19:28.034
That was 20 years ago.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.702
I got nothing for you.

19:29.704 --> 19:31.871
The woman that was with
him that day was my mother.

19:31.873 --> 19:34.707
You're Claire's girl?

19:34.709 --> 19:36.876
Come inside.

19:54.846 --> 19:56.896
Watch him.

20:20.705 --> 20:23.373
La petite mort.

20:23.375 --> 20:26.542
That's what the French call it.

20:26.544 --> 20:28.044
Not much technique,

20:28.046 --> 20:31.214
- but the enthusiasm was good.
- Who are you?

20:31.216 --> 20:33.549
With a face like yours Maria,

20:33.551 --> 20:36.352
I can get any man or woman I want.

20:42.193 --> 20:44.894
What about you, Abigail?

20:44.896 --> 20:48.398
Still as insatiable as ever, I hope?

20:52.120 --> 20:56.406
- Dahlia.
- Hello, my love.

20:56.408 --> 20:58.041
Miss me?

20:58.043 --> 21:01.077
Stop it.

21:01.079 --> 21:04.747
Same old temper.

21:04.749 --> 21:09.252
Well, this new host of yours, Maria,

21:09.254 --> 21:11.754
she's very pretty, but...

21:11.756 --> 21:14.590
she doesn't give you the
satisfaction that you need.

21:16.094 --> 21:20.396
Why don't we just get rid of her, hmm?

21:21.816 --> 21:24.434
Don't you still want me?

21:24.436 --> 21:26.436
Join me inside this body.

21:28.940 --> 21:30.773
I've missed you so much, Abigail.

21:30.775 --> 21:34.911
I am giving you one more chance.

21:34.913 --> 21:37.580
Come back to me,

21:37.582 --> 21:40.616
or I will have fun killing you in yours.

21:42.837 --> 21:44.337
No!

21:48.722 --> 21:51.857
I'm just trying to find
out about my mother.

21:51.859 --> 21:53.859
How long did she work for you?

21:53.861 --> 21:57.730
Claire never worked for
me. Claire was hiding here.

21:57.732 --> 22:01.200
- Hiding from who?
- Some crazy cult.

22:03.705 --> 22:05.571
The Order of Everlasting.

22:05.573 --> 22:08.040
Mm-hmm.

22:14.132 --> 22:16.132
Oh, my God.

22:21.556 --> 22:24.590
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

22:24.592 --> 22:26.008
Lie back.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.060
What happened?

22:28.062 --> 22:29.845
I was worried and came in after you.

22:29.847 --> 22:33.566
Found you laying in a heap.

22:33.568 --> 22:37.186
Clay's fast asleep in my bed.

22:37.188 --> 22:39.655
What is this thing, Mar?

22:39.657 --> 22:41.490
Whatever it is,

22:41.492 --> 22:44.076
it's strong enough that
Abigail couldn't handle it.

22:44.078 --> 22:47.613
Then why'd it let you go?

22:47.615 --> 22:49.365
I don't know.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.283
Try to rest, and don't go after that thing

22:51.285 --> 22:52.868
again without me.

22:52.870 --> 22:54.337
I got to go take care of something.

22:54.339 --> 22:58.758
- I'll be back soon.
- What? David, don't.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.876
Don't worry.

23:00.878 --> 23:03.295
There's something I have to fix.

23:18.396 --> 23:21.364
Ugh. I had a feeling it was her.

23:21.366 --> 23:24.817
Dahlia. Who the hell is Dahlia?

23:24.819 --> 23:26.819
She's a Lilan.

23:26.821 --> 23:29.655
A sex demon.

23:29.657 --> 23:32.491
Clay probably hasn't treated
his wife right in years,

23:32.493 --> 23:36.245
so all that pent-up energy
makes her a perfect host.

23:36.247 --> 23:38.080
She and I had a thing centuries ago

23:38.082 --> 23:40.216
until I found out she was crazy.

23:40.218 --> 23:42.668
She's been stalking me ever since.

23:42.670 --> 23:44.170
What kind of crazy?

23:44.172 --> 23:45.638
She was obsessed.

23:45.640 --> 23:46.806
She didn't just want me.

23:46.808 --> 23:48.674
She wanted to be me.

23:48.676 --> 23:51.427
Uses her power to make
her host look like my host.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.562
So, why didn't you destroy her?

23:59.320 --> 24:01.854
You still love her.

24:01.856 --> 24:06.192
That's why Enos sent her,
to turn you against me.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.911
Dahlia and I have a long history together.

24:08.913 --> 24:10.112
She's a killer.

24:10.114 --> 24:11.530
She's a demon.

24:11.532 --> 24:15.501
Like me, remember?

24:15.503 --> 24:17.870
Problem is, I get in a
room with her and something

24:17.872 --> 24:22.508
just turns on inside.

24:22.510 --> 24:23.926
I can't help it.

24:23.928 --> 24:26.212
Not everyone's an ice queen, Maria.

24:26.214 --> 24:29.548
If you won't take care
of our urges, then I will.

24:29.550 --> 24:31.684
That's not fair.

24:31.686 --> 24:33.969
After what you did, I don't have a choice.

24:33.971 --> 24:36.355
How long are you gonna
keep blaming me for Spencer?

24:36.357 --> 24:37.857
You killed him!

24:37.859 --> 24:40.643
You killed any chance
I had to love someone!

24:40.645 --> 24:43.362
Because you didn't know how
to control your emotions yet.

24:44.899 --> 24:47.399
- Go away!
- It's me.

24:55.626 --> 24:57.376
What do you want, Dusty?

24:57.378 --> 24:58.994
You all right?

25:02.133 --> 25:03.999
The Reverend came by your place earlier.

25:04.001 --> 25:07.136
He looked pretty shook up.

25:07.138 --> 25:10.222
Thought you might want to know.

25:15.897 --> 25:17.513
This place has taken in

25:17.515 --> 25:19.565
all kinds of abused
women through the years.

25:19.567 --> 25:20.850
Not all of them tricked.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.319
Some of them cleaned, changed sheets,

25:23.321 --> 25:24.770
and helped me keep the place running

25:24.772 --> 25:29.191
'til we could move 'em somewhere safe.

25:29.193 --> 25:36.031
And some of these women were
running from the Everlasting.

25:36.033 --> 25:39.168
My dad never told me she was from there.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.203
When Mr. Parsing started coming in,

25:41.205 --> 25:42.538
I thought he was just trying to make it

25:42.540 --> 25:46.091
with the black girls, right?

25:46.093 --> 25:47.877
The Society of Sons,

25:47.879 --> 25:51.130
they're a nasty bunch of racist hypocrites.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.549
But he had something else in mind.

25:56.771 --> 26:00.472
The night your father shot
him, there was another man here.

26:00.474 --> 26:05.110
A face I'd never seen before.

26:05.112 --> 26:08.531
That same man came back about a year later

26:08.533 --> 26:10.449
asking if I knew where Claire was.

26:10.451 --> 26:12.284
Told me where to find him I did.

26:12.286 --> 26:14.870
Do you still have that address?

26:21.412 --> 26:23.495
I'll see if I can't dig it up for you.

26:23.497 --> 26:25.998
Gracie.

26:30.671 --> 26:34.173
Grace? Grace, you here?

26:34.175 --> 26:36.091
Tetra?

26:41.232 --> 26:43.566
Is anybody here?

26:57.167 --> 26:59.300
It's not enough for me to
be a soldier in your war.

26:59.302 --> 27:02.887
You had to draft my daughter into it too?

27:02.889 --> 27:06.557
Hasn't she suffered enough already?

27:06.559 --> 27:11.062
I'm so tired of fighting all the time.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.481
Fighting against the man I used to be.

27:18.021 --> 27:20.688
Against temptation.

27:35.288 --> 27:37.121
Forgive me, Lord.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.956
I just need a sign.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.342
Just show me we're winning.

27:43.046 --> 27:45.263
Is anybody even listening?

27:45.265 --> 27:47.849
I am.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.687
What's wrong?

27:52.689 --> 27:56.107
I was, uh, I was looking for Grace.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.609
She's safe.

27:58.611 --> 28:00.111
You saw her?

28:00.113 --> 28:02.030
Yes.

28:06.036 --> 28:08.319
Relax.

28:08.321 --> 28:12.240
It's all gonna be okay.

28:12.242 --> 28:16.711
- You've been drinking.
- I'm lost, Maria.

28:17.102 --> 28:21.688
No. You're not lost.

28:21.890 --> 28:23.923
You're just human.

28:33.059 --> 28:35.053
The incident at the lake house

28:35.056 --> 28:39.515
should have been enough
to scare anyone straight.

28:39.517 --> 28:42.852
But Charlotte's lust for
life was not to be tamed

28:42.854 --> 28:46.488
by something as easy as
a near-death experience.

28:49.026 --> 28:50.743
Glad to see you got your shingle back up.

28:52.997 --> 28:55.831
The only reason I didn't
have your ass entombed

28:55.833 --> 28:58.918
was I hear you took out
Sweetmouth's competition.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.871
A little token of our appreciation.

29:03.708 --> 29:07.543
Let's go, Charlotte.

29:07.545 --> 29:09.712
I don't think I can wait.

29:09.714 --> 29:11.180
What are you doing?

29:11.182 --> 29:13.265
I appreciate what you did.

29:13.267 --> 29:16.852
Not calling the cops.
I... I owe you for that,

29:16.854 --> 29:19.221
but I can't do this right now.

29:19.223 --> 29:21.523
It's that little priss, isn't it? Grace?

29:21.525 --> 29:24.360
Charlotte.

29:24.362 --> 29:26.946
I think I'm in love with her.

29:26.948 --> 29:29.448
Oh, my God.

29:29.450 --> 29:33.535
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

29:33.537 --> 29:38.040
I open my mouth and your
whole world comes apart.

29:38.042 --> 29:41.543
I swear on my family's name

29:41.545 --> 29:44.797
I will burn you to the ground.

29:57.595 --> 29:59.478
Hey, this is Grace. Leave a message.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.930
Grace,

30:00.932 --> 30:02.898
where the hell have you been?

30:02.900 --> 30:05.567
Call me back. I'm getting worried.

30:11.275 --> 30:13.609
I wasn't a good father to her.

30:13.611 --> 30:18.614
I... I tried to be good. I'm trying.

30:18.616 --> 30:21.951
But I... I failed her, just
like I failed her mother.

30:21.953 --> 30:23.836
You didn't fail anybody.

30:23.838 --> 30:26.121
No, I...

30:26.123 --> 30:28.123
All I know is the rest of the world

30:28.125 --> 30:29.625
can go to hell for all I care.

30:29.627 --> 30:33.929
The only thing that matters is my daughter.

30:33.931 --> 30:37.433
We'll protect her. I promise.

30:41.772 --> 30:43.472
You're a good man.

30:43.474 --> 30:47.476
Nothing you can do or have
ever done will change that.

30:57.538 --> 31:00.823
I've been wanting to
do that for a long time.

31:04.662 --> 31:06.795
I just couldn't fight it anymore.

31:31.689 --> 31:34.857
Maria, wait.

31:34.859 --> 31:37.693
No more waiting.

31:37.695 --> 31:39.695
No more.

31:42.533 --> 31:46.368
It's... it's happening again.

31:46.370 --> 31:48.037
Lucy. Lucy, what are you
doing? What are you doing?

31:48.039 --> 31:50.255
What... Lucy...

31:53.427 --> 31:55.911
L... Lucy. What's this?

31:55.913 --> 31:58.213
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

31:58.215 --> 31:59.548
W... what... Lucy.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.683
Maria.

32:01.685 --> 32:04.269
What's... preacher. It's a man.

32:04.271 --> 32:06.271
He's a preacher.

32:06.273 --> 32:10.359
Black man. It's a preacher. Preacher.

32:10.361 --> 32:11.360
Oh, my God.

32:17.952 --> 32:20.235
Maria.

32:20.237 --> 32:21.370
No, we can't.

32:25.409 --> 32:27.876
Oh, Maria. Maria, wait. No.

32:27.878 --> 32:29.244
- Oh.
- No, Maria, we can't do this.

32:29.246 --> 32:31.046
This isn't right.

32:31.048 --> 32:32.748
- Oh!
- We... we can't do this.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.917
This isn't right. This...

32:36.804 --> 32:38.253
Don't you want me?

32:38.255 --> 32:40.389
Stop. Oh!

32:47.231 --> 32:49.231
God help us.

32:49.233 --> 32:50.933
The Devil is with him. Stay here.

32:50.935 --> 32:54.903
No. No. Ah.

32:54.905 --> 32:56.488
Ah. Ah! Ahh!

32:56.490 --> 33:00.109
- Get off of him!
- I'm not finished.

33:06.917 --> 33:09.751
Dahlia!

33:09.753 --> 33:11.620
Hi, lover.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.455
Care to join us?

33:13.457 --> 33:14.790
I know he won't mind.

33:14.792 --> 33:18.510
No. I want you all for myself.

33:23.634 --> 33:26.935
Don't play games with me, Abigail.

33:26.937 --> 33:29.471
No more games.

33:29.473 --> 33:31.807
I've been thinking about what you said.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.475
I want to be with you.

33:33.477 --> 33:36.145
What are you saying?

33:47.158 --> 33:49.658
I'm so tired of Maria

33:49.660 --> 33:52.794
telling me what I can and can't do.

33:52.796 --> 33:56.832
I want to do what I want.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.885
I want this.

33:59.887 --> 34:01.803
I want to be inside you.

34:01.805 --> 34:03.505
You feel that?

34:03.507 --> 34:05.841
So deep.

34:05.843 --> 34:08.476
So nice.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.478
I love you.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.818
Forgive me, Dahlia.

34:16.820 --> 34:19.353
I've made my choice.

34:19.356 --> 34:20.989
I'm never going back to you.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.791
He's still not breathing.

34:51.021 --> 34:52.888
- Maria?
- You're gonna be okay.

34:56.110 --> 34:57.726
Come on. I'll take care of you.

35:00.614 --> 35:01.863
Okay, come on.

35:01.865 --> 35:04.449
I got you.

35:04.451 --> 35:06.451
Oh.

35:12.626 --> 35:15.043
Oh, Lord.

35:47.778 --> 35:51.847
Lucy? Thank God.

35:51.849 --> 35:54.282
I don't want you to worry
about anything, okay?

35:54.284 --> 35:57.419
With... with prayer and mercy,
we will work through this.

35:57.421 --> 36:00.122
Okay? I just want my good girl back.

36:00.124 --> 36:01.423
I just want things like they were before.

36:01.425 --> 36:04.459
- No.
- What?

36:04.461 --> 36:08.463
You treated me like I was nothing.

36:08.465 --> 36:10.966
I've lived without love for too long.

36:10.968 --> 36:14.136
I... I'm sorry, Terence.

36:14.138 --> 36:17.472
I'm... I'm not going back to what we had.

36:25.449 --> 36:29.201
I know. Go find Grace.

36:29.203 --> 36:32.454
Wait, I... I should help you.

36:32.456 --> 36:34.122
- You need to rest.
- Are you sure?

36:34.124 --> 36:36.658
I can take care of it. I am.

36:52.393 --> 36:55.477
Some people are like a drug.

36:55.479 --> 37:00.565
Hard to quit, no matter
how bad they are for you.

37:34.435 --> 37:37.269
Hey.

37:37.271 --> 37:39.721
Hi.

37:41.558 --> 37:44.726
I'm sorry I was short with you before.

37:46.730 --> 37:52.567
Everything's just been
kind of strange lately.

37:52.569 --> 37:55.370
I'm just not good at this sort of thing.

37:57.741 --> 38:01.076
What kind of thing is that?

38:01.078 --> 38:05.080
Whatever this is.

38:08.418 --> 38:10.585
How about I order us some takeout?

38:12.973 --> 38:15.307
That sounds perfect.

38:21.482 --> 38:23.598
Tetra, what happened?

38:23.600 --> 38:25.433
Elijah.

38:25.435 --> 38:28.103
- What did I do?
- Listen carefully.

38:28.105 --> 38:29.738
- What?
- Gracie's in danger.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.490
What do you mean?

38:31.492 --> 38:33.909
The Sign of the Angel is
turning to the Rune of Tath.

38:33.911 --> 38:36.495
Gracie's an angel like
her mother had to be.

38:36.497 --> 38:38.079
Leave Gracie out of this.

38:38.081 --> 38:40.282
Maria is strong enough to defeat Enos.

38:40.284 --> 38:42.083
She's not. She's not.

38:42.085 --> 38:46.671
We need both of them, devil
and angel, to stop Enos.

38:46.673 --> 38:49.124
That's why he's going after her again,

38:49.126 --> 38:51.510
and where he's taking her this time,

38:51.512 --> 38:53.795
my soul may be the only one damned enough

38:53.797 --> 38:56.515
to follow her there.

38:56.517 --> 38:58.934
How?

39:07.978 --> 39:09.611
I want to thank you

39:09.613 --> 39:13.481
for giving Grace to all of us.

39:39.843 --> 39:42.510
Hello?

39:50.520 --> 39:52.687
Hello?

39:56.193 --> 39:58.410
Anybody here?

40:22.719 --> 40:26.221
You Miss Gracie?

40:26.223 --> 40:28.690
Yes.

40:28.692 --> 40:31.559
I'm here to help you find your mother.

40:54.251 --> 40:58.253
Lord or darkness, I'm giving myself to you.
