00:02.125 --> 00:04.375
Hey, everyone.
Edie, hop to it.

00:04.458 --> 00:06.250
Oh, everybody, I'm trying this
new thing where I leave my car

00:06.333 --> 00:08.875
running so I don't get caught up
in all your<i> mishegas, </i>so...

00:08.959 --> 00:10.125
VANESSA:
Edie, you'll spend the day

00:10.208 --> 00:12.291
with Jimmy so we can build
your new bedroom set!

00:12.375 --> 00:13.917
All right, come on,
pork chop, let's go. (whistles)

00:14.000 --> 00:15.583
Oh. Uh, can we talk about
where you're taking Edie?

00:15.667 --> 00:18.125
Gerald, I just told you
about the running car thing.

00:18.208 --> 00:19.875
I was hoping
you could maybe take her

00:19.959 --> 00:21.792
to the Pasadena Museum
of Science &amp; Technology?

00:21.875 --> 00:24.875
(car key remote beeps)

00:24.959 --> 00:27.667
He's obsessed with having her
around smart stuff all the time.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.959
It's like, come on.
Let her just be a kid.

00:30.041 --> 00:32.667
Sometimes a baby just wants
to watch<i> Bachelor in Paradise. </i>

00:32.750 --> 00:36.583
Oh, what about that Josh, huh?
He's trouble. (laughs)

00:36.667 --> 00:38.875
I don't watch the show.
I... I just am guessing.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.166
JIMMY:
All right, Edie,

00:41.250 --> 00:42.375
I'll take you to the museum.

00:42.458 --> 00:44.542
I'll teach you some
really important things

00:44.625 --> 00:46.917
like how to get through
a boring museum in a half hour.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.709
You start at the gift shop,
then go straight to the exit.

00:48.792 --> 00:50.083
(blows raspberry)
Come on.

00:50.166 --> 00:52.125
Here, I'm gonna put
these on your hand.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.917
There you go.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.625
Now I'll hold on to you
so you don't float away.

00:56.709 --> 01:00.625
And then I'll hold on to this
trash can just in case. See?

01:00.709 --> 01:03.208
Yeah.
All right, should
we try it? Ready?

01:03.291 --> 01:04.917
Should I let go?
Yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:05.917
Yeah?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.667
Should I let go of this?

01:07.750 --> 01:09.500
Yeah.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.250
There we go.
You didn't float away.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.291
Now you tell your dad you
learned something about science.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.250
It's called gravity.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.625
I don't want to bother you,
but my name is Leslie,

01:17.709 --> 01:19.417
and I'm a modeling
scout from Apex Models.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.875
Oh. Thank you.

01:20.959 --> 01:22.166
I'm very flattered.
Hair or skin?

01:22.250 --> 01:25.291
(laughs) I was actually
interested in this little lady.

01:25.375 --> 01:27.959
Oh. Uh, this is
my granddaughter Edie.

01:28.041 --> 01:29.542
Say hi, Edie.
Hi, Edie.

01:29.625 --> 01:31.250
Oh, you don't say "Edie."
You say... What's your name?

01:31.333 --> 01:32.959
Leslie.
Leslie.
Say, "Hi, Leslie."

01:33.041 --> 01:34.250
Hi, Leslie.
Hi, Leslie.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.333
Hi, sweetheart.
Has she modeled before?

01:36.417 --> 01:37.959
JIMMY: No, but she has
expressed interest.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.041
She's very comfortable
with her body.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.625
She's naked
most of the day.

01:41.709 --> 01:43.417
Well, here you go.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.834
This Thursday, we are
having an audition

01:45.917 --> 01:47.959
for a new toddler food campaign,
and you should bring her by.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.417
Bye, sweetie.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.000
You hear that, Edie?

You're gonna be a model.

was when that bread
shipment was late.

02:35.083 --> 02:37.792
Yeah, what was that?
It was, like, a half hour late.

02:37.875 --> 02:39.750
We do okay here. Victor,
what about that, uh,

02:39.834 --> 02:41.250
oven technician
you were dating?

02:41.333 --> 02:43.375
Ah. Agnieska was only
dating me for a green card.

Yeah. Ah.

Ugh. Whoa. Now I know why
they call them museum legs.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.333
How was it?
Oh, it was great.

03:38.417 --> 03:39.917
It was so...

03:40.000 --> 03:41.041
interactive.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.083
Did she play
with the reactor?

03:43.667 --> 03:45.166
She got inside,
and she spun around,

and she felt the...
static, and...

03:48.417 --> 03:50.709
(sighs)
I didn't go. I wanted to go.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.792
I did, but something
amazing happened.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.542
Something that's gonna change
all of our lives forever.

03:54.625 --> 03:57.500
You bought us a new house?

03:57.583 --> 03:59.000
you're waiting
for me to do?

03:59.083 --> 04:00.583
No. A modeling scout
discovered Edie

04:00.667 --> 04:02.792
and wants her to audition
for a big ad campaign.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.375
Well, it's too bad

04:04.458 --> 04:06.792
modeling is just such a
wasteland of a career path.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.083
Otherwise, it could be fun.
It's a nice compliment though.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.834
Vanessa, can Edie model?

04:11.917 --> 04:13.125
I'm with Gerald. No way.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.458
Sara, can Edie model?

04:14.542 --> 04:16.125
I agree with them.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.834
I don't think
it's a good idea.
Aah!

04:17.917 --> 04:19.458
When I was little,
my mom would enter me

04:19.542 --> 04:22.125
in the Princess Blueberry
pageant every year.

04:22.208 --> 04:23.333
I still get chills
thinking about it.

04:23.417 --> 04:26.917
I once saw a mom
bite another mom in the face.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.250
GERALD:
I can't believe you want

04:28.333 --> 04:29.333
your granddaughter
to be a model.

04:29.417 --> 04:30.834
Am I missing something here?

04:30.917 --> 04:32.125
When did modeling
become a negative?

04:32.208 --> 04:33.667
Huh? Edie is pretty,

04:33.750 --> 04:35.458
and they want
to give her money for it.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.083
Why would you stand
in the way of that?

04:37.166 --> 04:38.458
Did anyone try
to stop Neil Armstrong

04:38.542 --> 04:40.208
from going into space?

04:40.291 --> 04:42.709
Did they try to stop Martin
Luther King Jr. from bringing

04:42.792 --> 04:45.041
racial equality to this great
country that I call America?

04:45.125 --> 04:47.417
Yes. A lot of people
tried to stop him.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.959
You should really
see<i> Selma. </i>

04:49.041 --> 04:50.208
Aah.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.166
Jimmy? Jimmy, wait!

04:57.250 --> 05:00.166
Make just like we're fighting
in case Gerald's watching.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.208
I'm on your side.

05:01.291 --> 05:03.458
Let's do this.

05:03.542 --> 05:06.041
you'd go behind Gerald... you
would go behind Gerald's back,

05:06.125 --> 05:08.458
and-and we'll take her
to the audition?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.458
I'm so down,
I'm underground.
Great!

05:10.542 --> 05:12.792
Ow!
I had to sell it.

05:12.875 --> 05:14.750
He's not even watching.

05:14.834 --> 05:16.500
(laughs)
Let's do it.
(mock laughs)

05:19.709 --> 05:21.125
Hey, we're doing the right thing
here, aren't we?

05:21.208 --> 05:23.625
Of course. Who has
better judgment than us?

05:23.709 --> 05:26.458
That's a really smart point.
I have good ideas all the time,

05:26.542 --> 05:27.917
and Sara and Gerald
shoot 'em down.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.250
Before you came along,
this whole modeling thing

05:29.333 --> 05:30.792
would have been dead
in the water.

05:30.875 --> 05:33.041
Well, I say it a lot,
but thank God I'm here.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.542
(gasps) Ooh!

05:34.625 --> 05:36.125
That's the
Scoochers Diapers baby.

05:36.208 --> 05:37.875
She's in everything.

05:37.959 --> 05:39.834
Yeah.

05:39.917 --> 05:42.750
Oh, she's got, like, a
Steve Buscemi thing going.

05:42.834 --> 05:44.458
Maybe she's, like,
a character model.

05:44.542 --> 05:46.083

Puff it out, suck it in.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.041
Puff it out, suck it in.

05:48.125 --> 05:50.667
Then we smile.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.667
You see that? You don't
want to be like that, okay?

05:53.750 --> 05:55.667
You got to act like
you don't care.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.834
What do Kate Moss, Janice,
uh, Naomi have in common?

05:58.917 --> 06:01.333
They've all been on a boat?

06:01.417 --> 06:03.709
No. No. They-they
have attitude.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.125
They don't care.

06:05.208 --> 06:06.667
I don't care.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.041
Like, uh,
who cares?

06:08.125 --> 06:09.208
Edie Kingsley?

06:09.291 --> 06:10.709
One sec, Les.

06:10.792 --> 06:13.250
Edie, do you even want
to do this thing?

06:13.333 --> 06:15.667
Mm.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.792
Edie, do you want to be
the face of Fuzzy Fruit?

06:18.875 --> 06:20.667
JIMMY: Oh, she doesn't
<i>want </i>to model.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.041
She-she has to model.
It's what she does.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.083
All right, kid.
Edie, be-be careful.

06:25.166 --> 06:26.375
(laughs)

06:26.458 --> 06:28.000
(whispers):
I like her.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.709
Uh, we don't usually do this,
but we have seen

06:30.792 --> 06:33.583
a hundred kids today,
and, well, we love Edie.

06:33.667 --> 06:34.792
She's our girl!

06:35.875 --> 06:37.250
Here's all the info
for tomorrow.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.709
I'm so excited!

06:38.792 --> 06:40.208
VANESSA:
Oh, really?

06:40.291 --> 06:42.417
(chuckles): 'Cause I'm just
whatever about it.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.583
Yeah. It's... it's
a major modeling gig.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.041
Oh, my God.
What are we gonna tell Gerald?

06:55.125 --> 06:56.500
Nothing. He's never
gonna see a print ad

06:56.583 --> 06:57.792
in<i> Natural Mother </i>
magazine.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.417
True. He stopped
reading magazines

06:59.500 --> 07:01.750
'cause they're bad
for trees.
Weirdo.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.458
You just got to laugh.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.208
Hey. Hey, hey.

07:07.291 --> 07:08.834
Taste this.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.917
Ugh! What is that?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.750
It's my patented love potion.
It's an aphrodisiac in a glass.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.959
It tastes like you put
a bunch of oysters in a blender.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.709
Yeah, that's exactly
what I just said.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.625
(laughs)
Is it working?

07:22.709 --> 07:24.250
Ugh.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.417
Sorry about all this.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.750
It's so awkward.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.750
Yeah, that's why I like the
workplace to just be for work.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.750
But, on the other
hand, you know,

07:38.834 --> 07:41.458
I'm glad that you know, 'cause
I would feel like a tool

07:41.542 --> 07:44.458
if I didn't at least try.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.792
Which I guess I'm
doing right now.

07:46.875 --> 07:47.875
Badly.

07:49.875 --> 07:51.291
Okay, fine.

07:51.375 --> 07:53.041
Here's the deal.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.834
I'm not looking
for anything serious.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.792
Work comes first, always.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.792
And I definitely don't do drama.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.458
Ditto.

08:00.542 --> 08:02.542
Give me your phone.

08:05.583 --> 08:08.792
Ooh, the love potion
strikes again.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.250
It's getting sexier
in here already.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.458
(sighs):
Ah.

08:13.542 --> 08:17.125
I can't tell if I'm
hornier or just as horny.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.792
Time for the
photo shoot. Ooh.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.834
Who wants to be a star?

08:21.917 --> 08:23.500
I don't care.

08:23.583 --> 08:24.917
No, no, we're done with
the "don't care" thing.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.083
Now...

08:26.166 --> 08:27.500
Now all you do<i> is </i>care.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.166
Right?

08:29.250 --> 08:30.959
You attitude concerns me.

08:31.041 --> 08:32.834
I don't care.
Crap.

08:32.917 --> 08:35.250
Hey, uh, you're home early.
(chuckles)

08:35.333 --> 08:37.834
Nice to see you, too.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.667
Uh, since when do you two
hang out together so much?

08:41.875 --> 08:43.834
Oh, my God, are you two...

08:43.917 --> 08:45.500
Ew, no.

08:45.583 --> 08:48.834
Why "ew"?
You'd have a good time.

08:48.917 --> 08:50.834
No, we're just, uh,
we're honoring Gerald's wishes

08:50.917 --> 08:53.000
to surround Edie
with some culture.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.625
There's a lecture on art,

08:54.709 --> 08:56.625
uh, at the cultural... uh...

08:56.709 --> 08:58.000
(engine starts)

08:58.083 --> 09:00.625
...emporium.

09:00.709 --> 09:02.709
Bye, Grandma.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.792
(crying)

09:06.875 --> 09:09.458
Come on Edie, smile.
Come on, just do it.

09:09.542 --> 09:10.709
She did it.
Did you get that?

09:10.792 --> 09:11.875
No? Okay,
that's on you.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.166
(mouths)

09:13.250 --> 09:14.875
(crying)

09:14.959 --> 09:17.500
I'd be crying too if I was
forced to eat that garbage.

09:17.583 --> 09:18.875
But it's not that bad.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.959
(grunts)

09:21.083 --> 09:22.792
No, no!

09:22.875 --> 09:24.709
Puff it out, suck it in.
Puff it out, suck it in.

09:24.792 --> 09:25.834
Puff it out, and smile.

09:25.917 --> 09:26.959
(screaming)

09:27.041 --> 09:28.208
It's okay, it's okay.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.625
MAN:
You're in the shot.

09:29.709 --> 09:31.000
I'm sorry, Ethan.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.625
We should've just
gone with the Scoochers Baby.

09:32.709 --> 09:34.166
Even though
she's a little bit...

09:34.250 --> 09:36.000
Unbelievable.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.250
(gasps)
How did you find us?

09:37.333 --> 09:38.875
I found this printout

09:38.959 --> 09:40.875
with all the info
on my kitchen counter.

09:40.959 --> 09:42.875
Oh, you're good.

09:42.959 --> 09:45.041
sleeping together. Honey.

09:45.125 --> 09:48.291
I'm so sorry, sweetie,
about these two.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.917
I guess I can
make that work.
Mm-hmm.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.542
I'm sorry,
would you ever consider

09:52.625 --> 09:54.000
being the mom
in this photo shoot?

09:54.083 --> 09:55.917
Really?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.917
Have you ever modeled before?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.250
a bit of a pageant queen.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.125
Sixth place,
Princess Blueberry...

10:01.208 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, that's good.
Let's go.
(chuckles)

10:06.000 --> 10:08.291
Vanessa? Edie?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.875
Love that. Feel it. Look here.

10:10.959 --> 10:12.709
Look at the bunny rabbit,
both of you.

10:12.792 --> 10:13.917
Both of you.
Teeth.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.125
Give me coy.
Give me coy.

10:15.208 --> 10:17.917
Mm-hmm.
Oh, perfect.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.208
Glow. I need you
to glow for me.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.000
You're making this
look easy.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.333
Oh, no, Gerald's trying
to video chat me. What do I do?

10:22.417 --> 10:23.417
Tell him you're in the park.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.542
But I'm not at the park.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.959
What am I...
(gasps)

10:26.041 --> 10:28.291
Oh. (chuckles)

10:28.375 --> 10:31.250
I'll just pretend that's real.
Okay, okay.

10:33.041 --> 10:34.166
Hey, G.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.542
Hey, where are you guys?

10:35.625 --> 10:36.583
We're at the park, man.

10:36.667 --> 10:37.709
Open your eyes.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.083
Uh...

10:39.166 --> 10:40.959
Looks like there's a storm.
Got to go, bye.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.041
But, uh...

10:44.542 --> 10:45.959
(kissing)

10:46.041 --> 10:47.583
Oh, I hope didn't
improvise too much.

10:47.667 --> 10:49.709
You can always reel
me in, but, no,

10:49.792 --> 10:50.792
I will go there.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.750
All right, take it easy, Iman.

10:52.834 --> 10:54.667
So when will Edie's ad
be in the magazine?

10:54.750 --> 10:55.750
Next month.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.375
But the billboard
goes up tomorrow.

10:57.458 --> 10:58.959
Billboard?
What billboard?

10:59.041 --> 11:00.375
The one on Sunset.

11:00.458 --> 11:03.458
I bet your daddy
is gonna be so proud.

11:04.917 --> 11:07.083
Oh, God, is her daddy dead?

11:07.166 --> 11:10.291
I keep doing that.

11:11.375 --> 11:12.709
This sucks. Gerald's gonna
see the billboard.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.542
He takes Sunset on his way
to the community garden.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.875
I can't believe you two idiots
roped me into this.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.291
Please. You were practically
unbuttoning your shirt

11:18.375 --> 11:19.375
for that photographer.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.291
Well, the vibe
he created on set

11:21.375 --> 11:23.375
makes you really willing
to go there, you know?

11:23.458 --> 11:25.542
Okay, This is what
we're gonna do.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.208
We are going to convince Gerald

11:27.291 --> 11:28.959
that modeling
is good for Edie.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.083
There must be
a study somewhere

11:31.166 --> 11:33.166
that it helps with posture
or some crap.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.792
But we already
did the photo shoot.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.291
And the billboard's up tomorrow.

11:36.375 --> 11:37.583
We can just say
that Edie got the gig

11:37.667 --> 11:39.291
after he gave us his blessing.

11:39.375 --> 11:40.875
That's the dopiest idea
I've ever heard.

11:40.959 --> 11:42.208
Let's try it.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.959
And wash off all that makeup
before you see Gerald.

11:45.041 --> 11:47.291
Oh, but I won't remember
how they did it.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.417
I got you.
Oh.

11:51.792 --> 11:54.709
"Good things about
being a baby model."

11:54.792 --> 11:58.000
Nothing?
Maybe I didn't ask it right.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.291
Full house tonight, everyone.
Get off your butts.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.250
Didn't you go out with Jess
last night? How was it?

12:02.333 --> 12:03.250
It was good.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.834
Tell us more.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.792
It was good.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.333
(laughs):
Ooh, yeah!

12:08.417 --> 12:10.333
Oh. I don't know why
I got that happy.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.333
So you think
she's definitely not into me?

12:12.417 --> 12:14.375
Nope.

12:14.458 --> 12:16.000
So what else
can you tell us?

12:16.083 --> 12:18.333
Nothing. This isn't
your personal soap opera.

12:18.417 --> 12:21.041
I already said too much,
and Jess is gonna be here soon.

12:21.125 --> 12:22.583
No, she actually
called in sick.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.834
Really?

12:24.917 --> 12:26.875
Hmm.

12:26.959 --> 12:29.083
All right, everyone,
back to work.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.625
She called in sick?

12:30.709 --> 12:33.834
Really? She didn't seem sick
when I saw her.

12:33.917 --> 12:36.166
I don't know, she just
said she was sick.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.500
Hmm. Hmm.

12:39.583 --> 12:42.542
Who talked to her?
Did she sound sick?

12:42.625 --> 12:45.166
Do you think
she's avoiding me?

12:45.250 --> 12:46.375
Annelise, are you okay?

12:46.458 --> 12:48.375
At the end of the night,
I teased her a little

12:48.458 --> 12:49.500
about her duct tape wallet.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.625
Do you think I offended her?
Why did I say that?

12:51.709 --> 12:53.542
I should text her
that I like her wallet, right?

12:53.625 --> 12:55.375
Mm-mm. No.

12:55.458 --> 12:58.500
because of some light teasing
on an otherwise amazing date?

12:58.583 --> 13:00.542
What an oversensitive bitch!

13:00.625 --> 13:02.792
Ugh! I hate drama!

13:04.500 --> 13:07.917
Sexy has gone in new direction.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.458
And I am loving it.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.041
(quietly):
Sara? Sara.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.083
Uh, wow,

13:15.166 --> 13:17.417
has anyone noticed
that pretty girl in the bar?

13:17.500 --> 13:19.667
She seems very happy.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.625
Maybe she's a model.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.417
You know,
speaking of models,

13:23.500 --> 13:26.000
remember when we were
talking about Edie modeling?

13:26.083 --> 13:27.000
SARA:
Uh-huh.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.291
It could be a good idea.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.834
Funny you should
say that, Vanessa.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.417
I was listening to NPR today,

13:32.500 --> 13:35.417
and apparently there's
a new study out that proves

13:35.500 --> 13:37.417
praising a girl's
physical appearance actually

13:37.500 --> 13:39.417
improves her self-esteem

13:39.500 --> 13:41.834
and therefore
adult earning potential.

13:41.917 --> 13:44.333
Yeah, I heard that-that same
show. It was a 3:00 show, right?

13:44.417 --> 13:46.667
Yes, that's
the very show.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.750
if I've said it once, I've
said it a million times:

13:48.834 --> 13:51.959
any new experience is a good
experience for a child.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.291
Yup.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.083
What's going on?

13:55.166 --> 13:57.000
Why are we talking
about modeling?

13:58.458 --> 14:00.333
Oh, please don't tell me

14:00.417 --> 14:03.083
you called that modeling agent
that-that asked about Edie.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.458
Mom? Dad?

14:05.542 --> 14:06.750
No.

14:06.834 --> 14:07.709
Vanessa?

14:07.792 --> 14:09.417
You really want
to lie to me?

14:09.500 --> 14:10.875
'Cause I would never lie to you.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.458
I would never break
this amazing trust

14:12.542 --> 14:14.667
we have between us.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.417
Oh, my God!

14:17.583 --> 14:19.917
We took Edie on an audition.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.417
But the good news is
that she booked it

14:22.500 --> 14:25.208
and she's on a huge billboard
with your mom.

14:25.291 --> 14:26.917
Yay!
Mom.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.792
Behind my back?

14:28.875 --> 14:30.458
I was not part
of the initial plan,

14:30.542 --> 14:32.500
and I tried very hard
to stop it.

14:32.583 --> 14:35.625
But then I was roped in
through vanity.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.500
You know, it's one thing
for you to ignore me

14:37.583 --> 14:39.375
when I ask you to take
her to the science fair

14:39.458 --> 14:40.375
or-or the museum.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.500
That I can handle.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.625
But this is too far.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.250
Why is this
such a big deal?

14:45.333 --> 14:47.500
Because I don't want Edie
to feel judged by her looks.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.291
You know, I-I grew up chubby

14:49.375 --> 14:51.500
and I was made to feel like
a loser because of it, right?

14:51.583 --> 14:53.458
You know, I never got picked
for any sports teams,

14:53.542 --> 14:55.250
and I didn't have a date
to the dance,

14:55.333 --> 14:57.667
and in-in the school play,
I was cast as Shrub Number Four

14:57.750 --> 14:59.500
because they said
it fit my body type.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.709
You should've been Shrub Number
One, 'cause that kid sucked.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.500
Yeah. And that was
as a guy, okay?

15:03.583 --> 15:05.875
It's gonna be way harder
for Edie not to feel like

15:05.959 --> 15:07.709
her entire self-worth
is just wrapped up

15:07.792 --> 15:09.333
in what everyone else thinks.

15:09.417 --> 15:12.333
Gerald, I know you had
a hard time as a kid,

15:12.417 --> 15:14.667
but that doesn't mean Edie will.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.542
I mean, sure, there's
winners and losers, but...

15:17.625 --> 15:18.667
Edie's a winner.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.166
What are you trying to say?

15:20.250 --> 15:21.542
What was I?

15:21.625 --> 15:24.458
Well, you weren't saying
that you were...

15:24.542 --> 15:26.041
What was the point
of the Tree Number Four story?

15:26.125 --> 15:27.917
Just show me Edie's billboard,
all right?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.375
Let's go.

15:29.458 --> 15:32.041
Oh, no.

15:32.125 --> 15:34.458
Jess has been M.I.A.
for two days.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.542
Think, people. Be part of
the solution, not the problem.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.542
I don't know. Uh, I think
if Jess says she's sick,

15:39.625 --> 15:40.542
she must be sick.

15:40.625 --> 15:41.959
Oh, because lying doesn't exist?

15:42.041 --> 15:43.542
Go back to work. You're useless.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.000
What you got
for me, Cindy?

15:45.083 --> 15:46.750
Well, I called her
a little while ago,

15:46.834 --> 15:48.375
and she sounded
sick to me.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.542
You called her?
Why did you hide that from me?

15:50.625 --> 15:52.166
Is something going on
between you two?

15:52.250 --> 15:53.583
No.
Are you bisexual?

15:53.667 --> 15:55.625
Yes.

15:56.709 --> 15:58.542
Is this what you wanted?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.291
It's riding the line between
interesting and terrifying.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.583
Okay, you know what, I didn't
want it to come to this,

16:02.667 --> 16:05.667
but who thinks
I should send her flowers?

16:07.041 --> 16:08.250
No one?
OTHERS:
Mm-mm.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.959
Okay.

16:12.959 --> 16:15.291
Hi. This is Annelise.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.291
Mm-hmm. I need to cancel
a delivery of flowers.

16:18.375 --> 16:21.291
Well, call the driver
and tell him to turn around!

16:22.667 --> 16:24.834
SARA:
What the hell?

16:24.917 --> 16:27.583
They edited my face
into another face!

16:27.667 --> 16:29.542
It's not about you
right now.

16:31.041 --> 16:34.583
If I'm being honest...

16:34.667 --> 16:38.083
I love this.
My baby's a model!

16:40.583 --> 16:43.458
Aw. So cute. I mean,
I always think she's cute,

16:43.542 --> 16:45.417
but she's even cuter
ten feet tall.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.417
All the more cheek to pinch.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.417
Oh, God, I sound so shallow.
I sound like Jimmy.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.000
Oh. N-No offense, Jimmy.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.417
My body looks nice.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.917
GERALD: I mean, you know,
I guess if Edie had fun,

16:57.000 --> 16:58.542
we can do it
a little longer, right?

16:58.625 --> 17:00.417
Good, 'cause we already said yes
to an audition tomorrow

17:00.500 --> 17:01.959
for Whammy Jammy
pajamas.

17:02.041 --> 17:05.458
Gerald, welcome
to the shallow end.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.166
Hey.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.333
Look, I'm-I'm
really sorry, okay?

17:12.417 --> 17:14.291
Clearly, I started
something I shouldn't have.

17:14.375 --> 17:15.875
It's fine. I'm fine.

17:15.959 --> 17:18.083
Good. Where you going?

17:18.166 --> 17:21.083
Just going to...

17:21.166 --> 17:23.375
Jimmy's restaurant.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.750
Damn it.

17:25.834 --> 17:28.208
Guys, get in the car!
She's doing something crazy!

17:28.291 --> 17:29.500
CJ:
Come on, let's go!

17:29.583 --> 17:31.875
(engine starts)

17:31.959 --> 17:34.125
Where are we going?

17:34.208 --> 17:36.041
Jess's house, to see
if she's really sick.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.333
Time to call that girl
on what she really is:

17:38.417 --> 17:39.625
pot-stirring drama queen.

17:39.709 --> 17:41.792
VICTOR:
Ooh, I love road trips!

17:41.875 --> 17:43.625
Ooh, put on Adele.

17:43.709 --> 17:46.125
I feel like this is my fault.
I wanted things sexy

17:46.208 --> 17:48.458
and dramatic, and
it worked out perfectly, so...

17:48.542 --> 17:50.458
I guess I'm pretty proud
of myself.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.041
Nope, not your fault.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.458
This is just who I
am in relationships.

17:54.542 --> 17:56.792
Annelise, you are better
than this.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.458
Yeah. You should be confident.

17:58.542 --> 18:00.583
You're smart,
you're hardworking.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.458
And... funny.

18:02.542 --> 18:05.250
You're the complete package, so
why are you acting so insecure?

18:10.375 --> 18:11.500
(engine stops)

18:11.583 --> 18:14.500
I don't know what the
hell is wrong with me.

18:14.583 --> 18:15.959
Let's unpack it.

18:16.041 --> 18:17.959
Well,

18:18.041 --> 18:20.542
I came out of the closet
kind of late in life.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.542
And then I went back in
for a couple of years.

18:22.625 --> 18:24.500
Mm-hmm.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.291
But then Jimmy hired me,
and that took over my life.

18:27.375 --> 18:28.750
I haven't had time to date.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.542
Yeah. So you don't have
much experience.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.500
But you'll get the hang of it.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.500
I never did.
But you, you-you might.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.792
Yeah. You just need
to take it slow.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.709
That's why I always have
at least three lovers

18:39.792 --> 18:41.709
at one given time.

18:41.792 --> 18:44.417
So many lovers and
no room for Victor?

18:44.500 --> 18:46.458
Yeah. You guys are right.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.792
I just need to chill.
Yeah.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.000
Sounds like we don't need
to go to Jess's house, huh?

18:51.083 --> 18:52.500
We're already here.

18:53.625 --> 18:54.625
VICTOR:
Wow, she has

18:54.709 --> 18:55.625
a great commute.

18:55.709 --> 18:57.166
Let's get out of here.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.542
Thanks, guys.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.458
(door opens)

19:07.041 --> 19:08.375
Uh-oh.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.208
You lying slut!

19:10.291 --> 19:11.625
I bought you two
vanilla martinis

19:11.709 --> 19:14.625
and an entrée salad,
and this is how you repay me?!

19:16.041 --> 19:17.500
And don't even bother
coming back into work tomorrow,

19:17.583 --> 19:19.500
because you are fired!

19:19.583 --> 19:21.792
Unless that's illegal for me to
do. Then I'll see you at 9:00.

19:21.875 --> 19:23.083
(engine starts)

19:27.166 --> 19:28.792
Have fun, Edie.

19:28.875 --> 19:31.792
Uh, I mean, we want you
to book it, but have fun.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.208
Oh, Whammy Jammies.

19:33.291 --> 19:34.417
That's us.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.208
Uh...

19:36.291 --> 19:38.083
you guys go ahead. I'm
gonna use the restroom.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.667
Okay.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.667
Hey, man.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.709
You, you,

20:04.792 --> 20:05.834
you and you.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.542
The rest of
you can go.

20:07.625 --> 20:09.250
Uh, go where? Where do we go?

20:09.333 --> 20:10.500
I don't care.

20:10.583 --> 20:11.709
Am I too obvious a choice?

20:11.792 --> 20:13.834
You going for more of
a Buscemi thing?

20:13.917 --> 20:15.625
No, you're just
all wrong.

20:15.709 --> 20:17.250
Oh.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.375
All right, w-well, thank you
for your consideration.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.750
I never considered you.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.709
I never considered you.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.333
Is that, uh, Edie's competition?

20:29.417 --> 20:31.333
She's nowhere near as cute
as Edie.

20:31.417 --> 20:34.625
(chuckles) I love
that you're getting into this.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.709
Kind of like the idea of Edie
being better than other babies.

20:36.792 --> 20:38.125
Tell me about it.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.709
You're better.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.625
Modeling is stupid.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.709
I don't want my granddaughter
being judged.

20:44.792 --> 20:45.709
Since when?

20:45.792 --> 20:47.959
Since Brad Goreski
hurt my feelings.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.041
This is a cruel, cruel world.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.667
Yes, you heard
me, parents.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.000
I don't want Edie
to feel like

20:53.083 --> 20:54.375
her entire self-worth
is wrapped up

20:54.458 --> 20:55.667
into what other people think
of her.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.000
You realize I said that
exact thing, right?

20:58.083 --> 20:59.667
What'd you say?

20:59.750 --> 21:00.667
So we're on the same side.

21:00.750 --> 21:01.792
Sure.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.166
Come on, let's get out of here.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.500
Let's do something good
for Edie.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.667
Yes. Finally!
We can take her to the...

21:06.750 --> 21:08.625
<i>Bachelor in Paradise?</i>
More like Vanessa in Paradise.

21:08.709 --> 21:09.834
This is
the best season ever.

21:09.917 --> 21:11.000
(chuckles)

21:11.083 --> 21:13.667
Josh, call me.
I'm waiting.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.041
And I'm a model.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.083
I'll take you
to the museum tomorrow.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.083
Oh, don't pick her! Come on!

21:19.166 --> 21:21.291
Mm, I knew
he was gonna pick her.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.291
You never get in the hot tub.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.583
No hot tub.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.750
No hot tub.

21:27.834 --> 21:30.458
And a pool.
