00:51.594 --> 00:53.574
You got everything you need?

00:57.194 --> 00:59.214
I heard you requested a solicitor.

01:00.714 --> 01:02.654
And a QC.

01:04.873 --> 01:06.814
Know this...

01:08.094 --> 01:11.214
every time you put your head up,
I'm gonna kick it.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.214
So, you can spend
as much money as you like.

01:16.234 --> 01:18.134
It's not gonna help you.

01:20.494 --> 01:22.694
It's taken us years
and now I've got you.

01:24.914 --> 01:26.814
And all our ducks...

01:28.034 --> 01:29.894
they're all lined up in a row.

01:36.014 --> 01:40.134
So, if you really want to help
yourself, then you make a statement.

01:43.074 --> 01:44.894
Tell me what happened.

01:47.394 --> 01:49.014
Why you did it.

01:57.854 --> 02:01.174
You think I should?
You reckon it would help me?

02:05.354 --> 02:07.234
And those ducks of yours...

02:44.635 --> 02:46.255
Probably do with
a couple more coats.

02:46.256 --> 02:47.954
Mm, it's not bad but.

02:47.955 --> 02:50.694
Time you came back to
your old trade.

02:50.695 --> 02:53.795
Why? I done so good at me last one.

02:54.855 --> 02:56.474
Terrence Wallace Falconer,

02:56.475 --> 02:59.554
a lifelong - if relatively
small-time - crook,

02:59.555 --> 03:02.074
was coming to the end of
a five-year jail term

03:02.075 --> 03:04.414
for amphetamine production
and supply.

03:04.415 --> 03:06.914
With parole only a few weeks away,

03:06.915 --> 03:09.894
he was on work release
and enjoying life.

03:09.895 --> 03:12.014
He'd made a few decisions.

03:12.015 --> 03:14.034
He was getting his act together.

03:14.035 --> 03:17.574
Hey, Dad.
G'day, mate! How are ya?

03:17.575 --> 03:20.474
Oi, come here.

03:20.475 --> 03:22.834
How you goin', Al?
Yeah, yeah, good.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.274
You want a chip?
No.

03:24.275 --> 03:26.914
So, where in that document
I signed me life away on

03:26.915 --> 03:29.193
does it say anything about
you havin' tea with your family?

03:29.194 --> 03:31.155
Well, I won't say nothin'
if you don't.

03:31.156 --> 03:33.354
Go on. Off you go.
Thanks, mate.

03:33.355 --> 03:35.954
But you'll be breakin' rocks
all arvo.

03:35.955 --> 03:39.114
You blokes managed to
start that XY yet?

03:39.115 --> 03:42.194
It's the fuel filter.
It's not. It's the electrics.

03:42.195 --> 03:44.193
Or maybe the points.
It was goin', "ch-ka, ch-ka..."

03:44.194 --> 03:45.975
It's not the points.
It's not the electrics.

03:50.635 --> 03:53.354
by the time Uncle Barry's
Christmas bash comes around,

03:53.355 --> 03:55.135
I'll be very happy -
I'm lookin' forward to that.

03:55.136 --> 03:56.954
Yeah, no worries.

03:56.955 --> 03:58.994
Al reckons he's got a job
for me here, so...

03:58.995 --> 04:01.355
once I'm out, we'll be
able to give her a respray.

04:04.255 --> 04:06.854
Oh, well, I better get back to it.

04:06.855 --> 04:09.474
So, we'll see youse Monday?

04:09.475 --> 04:12.315
Yep.
Be good.

04:13.635 --> 04:15.374
Look after him.
Yep.

04:15.375 --> 04:17.035
Yeah. Good, mate.

04:22.355 --> 04:24.254
Bit cute.

04:24.255 --> 04:25.914
Takes after his old man.

04:25.915 --> 04:28.935
Well, I hope that's all
they get from me.

04:37.595 --> 04:39.975
I believe an individual by the
name of Terrence Wallace Falconer

04:39.976 --> 04:41.454
is on work release here.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.894
Yeah.

04:42.895 --> 04:44.515
Terry?

04:46.055 --> 04:47.314
What, love?

04:47.315 --> 04:50.314
Detectives Macarthur and Patton,
Mr Falconer.

04:50.315 --> 04:52.734
Where do you blokes hail from?

04:52.735 --> 04:54.894
We have some questions for you.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.954
Fire away.

04:56.955 --> 05:00.035
You'll need to accompany us
to the station.

05:01.455 --> 05:03.594
I mean, I'm at work, fellas.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.854
I mean, you know where
I'm gonna be tonight,

05:05.855 --> 05:07.654
at Her Majesty's Hotel.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.435
Why don't youse pop in?

05:10.515 --> 05:12.614
Hands in front, sunshine.
Oh, come on.

05:12.629 --> 05:14.488
Alright?

05:14.489 --> 05:17.389
Alright, alright.
Here y'are. Here y'are.

05:19.589 --> 05:21.288
Back in a tick, Karina.

05:21.289 --> 05:24.928
Terry Falconer's criminal
career had been pretty varied.

05:24.929 --> 05:28.448
In between panelbeating
and amphet manufacturing,

05:28.449 --> 05:30.768
he'd tried his hand
at car rebirthing,

05:30.769 --> 05:33.088
receiving stolen goods
and money laundering.

05:33.089 --> 05:37.469
Plus, he'd been associated with the
Gypsy Jokers outlaw motorcycle club.

05:39.209 --> 05:42.049
So, cops wanting a chat
wasn't that unusual.

05:53.409 --> 05:56.108
You blokes should have
your seatbelts on, you know?

05:56.207 --> 05:57.627
You're breaking the law.

05:59.647 --> 06:01.326
Where youse from, anyway?

06:01.327 --> 06:04.786
Like, Gangs or Drug Squad? What?

06:04.787 --> 06:07.667
Pull over
for a moment, Constable.

06:09.447 --> 06:11.346
That car ride kicked off

06:11.347 --> 06:13.207
one of the longest
police investigations

06:13.208 --> 06:14.787
in Australia's history.

06:16.787 --> 06:19.987
How long's this gonna take? I mean,
some of us have real jobs, you know?

06:24.027 --> 06:26.367
Fuck off!
Hold him!

06:27.827 --> 06:30.426
Shit! Get a hold of that arm!
I'm trying!

06:30.427 --> 06:33.366
Aaagh!

06:33.367 --> 06:36.366
Aagh! Aaagh!

06:36.367 --> 06:37.827
Shh!

06:48.127 --> 06:49.907
Shh!

07:45.267 --> 07:47.027
You think
he's gonna be OK in there?

07:47.028 --> 07:49.986
He'll be fine.
It's a pretty warm day.

07:49.987 --> 07:52.346
Don't fuckin' worry about it!

07:52.347 --> 07:54.647
Remember to bend your knees.
It prevents lower-back injuries.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.027
Ready?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.986
OK, phase three.

08:08.987 --> 08:12.786
Get changed, swap the tyres
and the plates back,

08:12.787 --> 08:15.307
drop that back to mine,
see you in a couple of days.

08:50.427 --> 08:52.987
We'll take this in.
Remember to bend your knees.

08:59.847 --> 09:01.867
Open it.

09:08.927 --> 09:11.206
Let me out. Get me out, mate.

09:11.207 --> 09:13.806
Where... where am I?

09:13.807 --> 09:15.526
Huh?

09:15.527 --> 09:17.347
Aagh!

09:18.687 --> 09:20.166
Ohh...

09:20.167 --> 09:21.507
Check him.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.906
Is that a Gypsy Joker tatt?

09:26.907 --> 09:31.606
It's a skull,
and I think that's a joker.

09:31.607 --> 09:33.107
No, I'm not a Joker.

09:38.027 --> 09:41.166
You're the dog
who murdered my grandparents.

09:41.167 --> 09:43.227
No, I didn't... Aaagh!

09:53.747 --> 09:56.607
So, um... You want me
to drop him back now?

09:58.207 --> 10:00.866
Are you fuckin' for real?

10:00.867 --> 10:03.387
Sure, take the prick home.
No worries.

10:05.387 --> 10:09.066
Put him in the ute.
You and Muzza drive him up.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.446
Up where?
Don't ask so many fucking questions.

10:12.447 --> 10:14.986
So, Rooster, just...

10:14.987 --> 10:17.127
this is gonna knock off
that 100 grand I owe, isn't it?

10:28.187 --> 10:32.466
Anthony John
Michael Perish, known as 'Rooster',

10:32.467 --> 10:34.886
grew up with his large family
on a poultry farm

10:34.887 --> 10:37.547
in the city's semi-rural outskirts.

10:39.047 --> 10:41.266
In June 1993,

10:41.267 --> 10:45.226
when Anthony was 24 and on the run
for a minor drug charge,

10:45.227 --> 10:49.267
his grandmother and grandfather
were brutally murdered.

10:51.127 --> 10:52.826
In the long years since,

10:52.827 --> 10:56.147
no charges had been brought
against anyone.

11:15.427 --> 11:18.046
- I need to talk to you.
- Yeah? What about?

11:18.047 --> 11:19.547
Didi and Baba.

11:21.350 --> 11:22.709
What about 'em?

11:22.710 --> 11:24.609
I know who killed 'em.

11:24.610 --> 11:27.649
No, I know... I know for sure
this time, OK?

11:27.650 --> 11:30.509
Yeah, who?
Some fucker called Terry Falconer.

11:30.510 --> 11:32.069
Never heard of him.

11:32.070 --> 11:34.449
OK, just... just listen, alright?

11:34.450 --> 11:37.029
Swamp Rat was down at this pub
in Macquarie Fields,

11:37.030 --> 11:39.049
and he met this sheila

11:39.050 --> 11:41.069
and this sheila says
that she knows for a fact

11:41.070 --> 11:42.928
that Terry Falconer was the shooter.

11:42.929 --> 11:44.608
Now, the other thing is
that she says

11:44.609 --> 11:46.790
that he knew all this stuff about
how Didi and Baba were killed.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.329
What stuff?

11:48.330 --> 11:50.170
Stuff that... that the cops
didn't even release.

11:50.171 --> 11:53.529
Stuff like... like how they
were found in the wrong beds.

11:53.530 --> 11:55.969
You know you always
tell stories wrong.

11:55.970 --> 11:57.908
You... you can't tell a joke
without getting it arsed about.

11:57.909 --> 11:59.390
That's what's happened here.

11:59.391 --> 12:01.490
Come here.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.969
G'day, Rooster.

12:12.970 --> 12:15.850
He didn't want to come with me
and I knew you wouldn't believe me.

12:21.410 --> 12:26.489
This sheila,
she, uh... she pissed? High?

12:26.490 --> 12:28.130
And Terry Falconer,
that was the name?

12:28.555 --> 12:31.113
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Terry Falconer.
That's what she said.

12:31.114 --> 12:33.253
She had a letter from the cops,
didn't she,

12:33.254 --> 12:34.993
saying how the prick's a dog.

12:34.994 --> 12:36.474
Yeah, I saw it with
me own two eyes...

12:36.475 --> 12:39.853
He did it, alright?
Falconer was the shooter.

12:39.854 --> 12:41.514
Now we gotta do something about it.

12:41.515 --> 12:44.533
Alright, why would some
Gypsy Joker lag kill 'em, mate?

12:44.534 --> 12:46.073
What's in it for him?

12:46.074 --> 12:48.233
Maybe it was that meth lab
you set up

12:48.234 --> 12:49.954
in the back of Didi
and Baba's backyard...

12:49.955 --> 12:52.473
How many times do I have to fuckin'
tell you, no-one knew about it?

12:52.474 --> 12:55.753
Then maybe it was done
by someone who you pissed off!

12:55.754 --> 12:58.333
And if we don't do something
about it, we look weak as piss.

12:58.334 --> 12:59.873
Oh, grow up. Grow up!

12:59.874 --> 13:02.393
What, me grow up?
You're the big, tough guy.

13:02.394 --> 13:04.832
But all these years, Didi and Baba
have been rotting in the ground,

13:04.833 --> 13:06.534
and what have you been
doing about it, Anthony?

13:06.535 --> 13:09.313
Sweet fuckin' nothin'!

13:09.314 --> 13:10.912
If you're gonna be a fence-sitter
about this,

13:10.913 --> 13:12.694
then I'm gonna
take care of it, alright?

13:12.695 --> 13:14.593
I'll fix it. I'll fuckin'...

13:14.594 --> 13:16.994
Always trying to stick it in
before it's stiff, eh?

13:21.974 --> 13:23.354
Fuck, Undies!

13:25.174 --> 13:26.913
Look, I'm not doing anything

13:26.914 --> 13:28.914
that points the cops to me, you,
any of us, alright?

13:28.983 --> 13:30.922
So, what have we gotta do, then?

13:32.583 --> 13:34.043
I'm gonna do it right.

14:56.363 --> 15:00.883
Beers for the boys, eh?
I'll have one.

15:02.203 --> 15:03.982
Any problems?
No.

15:03.983 --> 15:05.443
Good, good.

15:08.623 --> 15:10.323
Let's do this, eh?

15:19.783 --> 15:21.563
Is he alive?

19:38.763 --> 19:41.562
Terry Falconer
was listed as an escapee

19:41.563 --> 19:45.662
when he failed to return
to Silverwater Jail by 6pm.

19:45.663 --> 19:48.542
You sure they weren't real cops?

19:48.543 --> 19:50.002
They seemed legit to me.

19:50.003 --> 19:52.902
I saw their badges,
their guns, everything.

19:52.903 --> 19:55.122
No, no, we checked it out.

19:55.123 --> 19:57.762
Nobody sent any officers
to question Mr Falconer.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.762
Well, their car
looked like a real cop car.

19:59.763 --> 20:02.642
It even had one of them
little aerials.

20:02.643 --> 20:05.342
What'd these guys look like?
Like you guys.

20:05.343 --> 20:07.382
Like cops.

20:07.383 --> 20:08.963
Of course he went with 'em.

20:10.043 --> 20:13.202
I know what you blokes are
thinking - he's done a runner.

20:13.203 --> 20:16.562
But why would he?
He'll get paroled in a month.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.502
I mean, Terry's made
a fair few wrong turns in his life,

20:19.503 --> 20:20.962
but he's not an idiot.

20:20.963 --> 20:23.363
He's a good bloke
and he was getting it together.

20:23.364 --> 20:26.962
The investigation
was sky-wide.

20:26.963 --> 20:29.642
Terry could have faked
his own disappearance,

20:29.643 --> 20:31.922
could have been
kidnapped by corrupt cops,

20:31.923 --> 20:36.902
could have even been
snatched by enemies posing as cops.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.402
Without a body,

20:39.403 --> 20:42.723
it was going to be impossible
to prove any theory.

21:04.423 --> 21:06.923
What the bloody hell's that?

21:19.963 --> 21:21.702
- Oh!
- Ohh!

21:21.703 --> 21:24.003
Oh!

21:29.603 --> 21:31.123
There's another one
over there. Look.

21:35.963 --> 21:37.943
The bloke
Australians did vote for,

21:37.944 --> 21:39.441
Prime Minister John Howard,

21:39.442 --> 21:41.763
was celebrating with champagne
at Government House in Canberra

21:41.764 --> 21:44.942
after the swearing in
of his new ministry.

21:44.943 --> 21:46.442
All done.

21:46.443 --> 21:48.862
In the hope that he'll
eventually get to sample

21:48.863 --> 21:50.922
the Governor General's bubbly too,

21:50.923 --> 21:53.642
Mr Crean was embarking on
a listen-and-learn strategy,

21:53.643 --> 21:56.543
trying to find out what voters
want from the Labor Party.

22:01.783 --> 22:03.602
Laurie Oakes, National Nine News.

22:03.603 --> 22:06.942
Police have identified
the body parts

22:06.943 --> 22:08.982
of a man found in six bags

22:08.983 --> 22:10.762
in the Hastings River at Wauchope

22:10.763 --> 22:13.642
as those of missing prisoner
Terry Falconer.

22:13.643 --> 22:17.162
Two weeks ago, the 52-year-old
who was on work release,

22:17.163 --> 22:22.122
was abducted by three men
claiming to be police officers.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.762
Falconer had
just six weeks left to serve

22:24.763 --> 22:28.403
of a five-year jail term
for drug offences.

22:35.803 --> 22:38.803
So, this is you
putting it right, is it?

22:45.103 --> 22:47.043
You dump him in a tidal river.

22:48.683 --> 22:50.922
Did you think the fuckin' tide
might go out?

22:50.923 --> 22:53.362
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter?

22:53.363 --> 22:56.323
The whole idea was that the body
was never meant to be found!

22:58.983 --> 23:01.182
So, what did he... what did he...?

23:01.183 --> 23:03.262
Did he say... What'd he say?

23:03.263 --> 23:05.382
About what?

23:05.383 --> 23:08.123
About why he killed Didi and Baba.

23:10.783 --> 23:13.563
Didn't ask him.

23:19.783 --> 23:21.622
You didn't ask him?

23:21.623 --> 23:24.182
What the fuck are you on?

23:24.183 --> 23:25.603
I was supposed to be there, Anthony.

23:25.604 --> 23:29.002
I was supposed to be there when we
took him out, but you went ahead.

23:29.003 --> 23:30.563
You would have just stuffed it up,
like always.

23:30.564 --> 23:32.862
Me stuff it up?
They found his body!

23:32.863 --> 23:34.483
They found his fucking body!

23:35.523 --> 23:38.182
He would been over the Continental
Shelf if your mate had come through.

23:38.388 --> 23:41.147
Fuck you, Anthony!

23:41.148 --> 23:42.648
Fuck you, dickhead!

23:45.448 --> 23:49.187
Falconer killed Didi and Baba.
You said so, everyone said so.

23:49.188 --> 23:51.087
We agreed he had to go.

23:51.088 --> 23:53.687
But what if... what if he didn't?
Are you deaf?

23:53.688 --> 23:56.128
I did what I did
and I kept you out of it.

24:02.548 --> 24:04.507
It's gonna be alright, Unds.

24:04.508 --> 24:06.887
Come on, mate. Come on. Come on.

24:06.888 --> 24:08.848
Alright?
I'm gonna take care of you.

24:09.888 --> 24:12.128
It's alright.

24:13.548 --> 24:14.728
Yeah?

24:16.548 --> 24:18.008
Where are you?

24:24.608 --> 24:27.207
This isn't gonna be
a problem, is it?

24:27.208 --> 24:29.146
They're going on about how
he was abducted by pretend cops.

24:29.147 --> 24:30.606
They've got photofits of us.

24:30.607 --> 24:32.568
Your own mother wouldn't
recognise you.

24:32.569 --> 24:37.027
Mate, Falconer was a shit-bag
drug dealer from Macquarie Fields.

24:37.028 --> 24:39.247
Any investigation's gonna be a joke.

24:39.248 --> 24:42.528
Keep your people under control,
there'll be no problem.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.947
I know... I know it didn't work out
the way we planned it,

25:11.948 --> 25:13.447
but he had to go.

25:13.448 --> 25:16.027
Besides, none of us
have got any connections with him.

25:16.028 --> 25:17.867
We are in the clear.

25:17.868 --> 25:19.888
Yeah.

25:21.148 --> 25:23.528
Are you cool, Vito?

25:24.888 --> 25:30.147
Listen, the prick was
mouthing off, being smart,

25:30.148 --> 25:31.927
not giving a straight answer.

25:31.928 --> 25:35.427
When he started saying
he was gonna rat on us,

25:35.428 --> 25:38.707
that's just when I went up to him

25:38.708 --> 25:41.128
and chopped his head off.

26:10.076 --> 26:13.796
Jubelin, you're upside down.

26:16.610 --> 26:17.870
Relieves stress.

26:19.090 --> 26:20.589
You should give it a go.

26:20.590 --> 26:22.610
Oh, I'll stick to Ella Fitzgerald
and sauv blanc.

26:22.611 --> 26:25.129
Have you seen this?

26:25.130 --> 26:27.189
Pretty brazen, impersonating cops.

26:27.190 --> 26:29.789
Yeah, well, he was kidnapped,
dismembered and then dumped.

26:29.790 --> 26:32.029
They're putting
a strike force on it.

26:32.030 --> 26:35.749
I'm gonna put my hand up.
Righto, you go for gold, Gary.

26:35.750 --> 26:41.189
Hey, if I get OIC in this,
you wanna join me?

26:41.190 --> 26:44.329
No, because I'm OIC of
Strike Force Snowdon.

26:44.330 --> 26:45.669
Have fun.

26:45.670 --> 26:49.309
Gary Kevin Jubelin
was an Aries, a practising Buddhist

26:49.310 --> 26:52.749
and drank green tea
instead of coffee.

26:52.750 --> 26:57.549
His workmates called him Crazy Fuck,
behind his back, of course.

26:57.550 --> 27:00.409
Strike Force Tuno will investigate
the murder of Terry Falconer.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.269
Have you got any suspects?

27:02.270 --> 27:05.189
We have a number of lines of inquiry
we're investigating.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.709
The victim was a bikie.
Is this a turf war?

27:07.710 --> 27:10.449
At the moment, it's too early to
speculate on what the motives were

27:10.450 --> 27:12.029
behind Mr Falconer's death.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.910
If his murder was
part of organised crime,

27:13.911 --> 27:16.229
Tuno could run for months,
couldn't it?

27:16.230 --> 27:18.309
We don't put a time limit
on clearing up murder.

27:18.310 --> 27:21.049
That said, I have every confidence
that Detective Sergeant Jubelin...

27:21.050 --> 27:22.889
It will take as long as it takes.

27:22.890 --> 27:24.749
Yeah, I'll call you back.

27:24.750 --> 27:27.629
Mr Falconer's murder
was a violent and vicious crime.

27:27.630 --> 27:30.529
It needs to be solved
and I'm committed to doing that.

27:30.530 --> 27:32.809
What are you watching?

27:32.810 --> 27:34.270
You.

27:35.770 --> 27:37.230
Show us your tits.

27:50.070 --> 27:52.469
Every murder
investigation is different.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.950
Nobody knew how long it would take
to catch Terry Falconer's killer.

27:57.290 --> 27:58.869
Not even Gary Jubelin.

27:58.870 --> 28:01.489
He couldn't guess
it would take almost a decade,

28:01.490 --> 28:03.629
or that Terry's murder would expose

28:03.630 --> 28:07.590
a hidden web of vice,
violence and death.

28:24.690 --> 28:27.749
Our condolences, Mr Falconer.

28:27.750 --> 28:31.110
"Mr Falconer".
That was always my dad.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.729
How's the investigation?

28:33.730 --> 28:36.150
Well, it's early days yet, mate.

28:45.470 --> 28:49.189
So, detectives...
caught Uncle Terry's killer yet?

28:49.190 --> 28:53.269
The investigation
is proceeding, Miss Erlich.

28:53.270 --> 28:56.129
Those blokes who kidnapped him, they
had police gear on, didn't they?

28:56.130 --> 28:58.549
One of them wore a police uniform.

28:58.550 --> 29:03.169
If someone, like, knew something
about something,

29:03.170 --> 29:04.809
and they told youse,

29:04.810 --> 29:06.469
would they, like, get a reward?

29:06.470 --> 29:10.109
No reward for information
has been offered at this stage.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.909
But if you had information
on your uncle's murder,

29:12.910 --> 29:15.170
I'd imagine you'd want to
pass it on, wouldn't you?

29:15.171 --> 29:17.550
Paulina?

29:19.730 --> 29:23.070
Not here. Meet me tonight.

29:26.510 --> 29:28.670
But I only talk to you,
Detective Browne.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.950
You said you had something to
tell me about your uncle's death.

30:04.170 --> 30:07.110
Shit. Can you lend us 10 bucks?

30:13.150 --> 30:16.709
I had this shirt.
It was a police shirt.

30:16.710 --> 30:19.389
You know, with them
blue epaulet thingies.

30:19.390 --> 30:21.750
Not dress-up or nothin' -
the real deal.

30:23.230 --> 30:25.629
How'd you come by it?
Boyfriend gave it to me.

30:25.630 --> 30:27.950
A couple of weeks ago, some guy
asked me if he could borrow it.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.709
Got a name?
Can't remember.

30:30.710 --> 30:33.790
Where'd you meet him?
Some pub.

30:35.070 --> 30:36.810
How'd he know
you had a police shirt?

30:36.811 --> 30:38.430
I'd had a few.

30:39.690 --> 30:41.510
Is there anything you can remember?

30:53.470 --> 30:56.430
He wore colours.
Which club?

30:58.270 --> 31:01.630
Livin' Dead.

31:34.770 --> 31:36.750
Bit more on the boozies, love.

31:42.570 --> 31:44.110
Don't bother.

31:46.670 --> 31:49.689
Mr Pengilly, I'm Detective Jubelin.
This is Detective Evers.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.389
We're part of Strike Force Tuno,

31:51.390 --> 31:53.850
investigating the body that was
dumped in the Hastings River

31:53.851 --> 31:55.950
by men impersonating police.

31:59.970 --> 32:01.809
Know anything about that?

32:01.810 --> 32:04.429
Mate, I don't talk to coppers.

32:04.430 --> 32:07.809
Now, do you mind?
I'm shooting a movie here.

32:07.810 --> 32:09.270
Oh, is that for Tropfest, mate?

32:09.271 --> 32:13.209
Because you do know it is illegal
to shoot porn in New South Wales.

32:13.210 --> 32:14.709
Oh, you're right, Detective Evers.

32:14.710 --> 32:16.468
Why don't you get on
the phone and call Vice?

32:16.469 --> 32:18.370
Yeah, I mean, we could get 'em down
and they could take a...

32:18.371 --> 32:19.830
Alright, give it a rest.

32:21.430 --> 32:24.029
The way I hear,
Falconer got what he deserved.

32:24.030 --> 32:26.369
And how's that?
He was a dog.

32:26.370 --> 32:28.589
Tell 'em, Kenny.

32:28.590 --> 32:32.369
Saw this letter. Official
police letter had a coat of arms.

32:32.370 --> 32:34.190
Said Falconer would talk to anybody.

32:34.191 --> 32:37.789
Where'd you see this document?
Some sheila. She showed it to me.

32:37.790 --> 32:40.409
She said she knew Falconer.
Is, uh...

32:40.410 --> 32:42.489
Is this her?

32:42.490 --> 32:45.129
Nuh. She was older. Black hair.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.969
What exactly did she say?

32:47.970 --> 32:50.270
That Falconer, he was a fuckin' dog.

32:53.710 --> 32:57.149
It wasn't only from bikies
that Tuno officers heard stories

32:57.150 --> 33:01.029
of an older, dark-haired woman,
who had an official document

33:01.030 --> 33:05.429
apparently showing Terry Falconer
was a police informant.

33:05.430 --> 33:09.109
And it didn't take them long
to fit that description

33:09.110 --> 33:13.369
to Terry's former sister-in-law,
Dianne Louise Erlich.

33:13.370 --> 33:14.869
Well, it wasn't me.

33:14.870 --> 33:17.369
A letter like that'd get Terry
into all sorts of trouble.

33:17.370 --> 33:18.830
Why didn't you and Terry get on?

33:18.831 --> 33:21.589
He never liked that I had friends
in motorcycle clubs...

33:21.590 --> 33:25.749
clubs that rivalled
his Gypsy Jokers.

33:25.750 --> 33:28.090
And you never spoke to anyone
about his dealings with police?

33:28.091 --> 33:31.449
And why would I do that?

33:31.450 --> 33:33.430
I mean, I'm not a dog, am I?

33:36.350 --> 33:39.149
Mate, she knew she was
putting a burn notice on Terry.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.430
Never trust someone with
that many cocker spaniels, mate.

33:41.431 --> 33:44.550
Jack Russells, yes,
but cockers? Dodgy.

33:51.450 --> 33:53.550
My dad never wore Joker colours.

33:55.210 --> 33:57.489
He never was a member of any club.

33:57.490 --> 34:00.230
I just want youse to know that.

34:03.170 --> 34:05.310
It's Jase, isn't it?

34:06.670 --> 34:09.429
You want to tell us
anything else about your dad, Jase?

34:10.690 --> 34:13.030
Anything to do with his death?

34:24.210 --> 34:25.789
Terry was married twice

34:25.790 --> 34:28.489
and son, James,
is to his first wife?

34:28.489 --> 34:30.668
Yeah, and Jase is from his second.

34:30.670 --> 34:33.109
And where does
Dianne Erlich fit in?

34:33.110 --> 34:35.909
She's Terry's
second ex-wife's sister,

34:35.909 --> 34:39.529
mother to the delightful Paulina,
and she is his biggest fan...

34:39.530 --> 34:40.549
Not.

34:40.550 --> 34:44.449
We've had a dozen reports of
her flashing round that document,

34:44.449 --> 34:46.228
badmouthing Terry.

34:46.230 --> 34:49.268
Well, at the moment, that's
the best lead we've got, right?

34:49.270 --> 34:53.768
But she's not gonna be likely to be
directly involved in the kidnapping.

34:53.770 --> 34:55.268
Task Force Tuno.

34:55.270 --> 34:58.309
Well, Dianne's admitted
associations with bikies.

34:58.310 --> 35:00.108
If she knew her daughter
had a police shirt,

35:00.109 --> 35:02.590
she could be the link between it
and the Living Dead.

35:02.591 --> 35:04.950
Paulina Erlich
is downstairs with a lawyer.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.470
But she'll only
talk to Gary this time.

35:09.910 --> 35:13.310
I understand one of your detectives
took a statement from my client.

35:15.190 --> 35:17.629
A Senior Constable Browne?
That's right.

35:17.630 --> 35:22.790
Miss Erlich has made
a new statement on this matter.

35:28.070 --> 35:31.989
She said Browney made her say
she had the police shirt,

35:31.990 --> 35:34.769
which she only agreed to because
you and she are having an affair.

35:34.770 --> 35:35.989
An affair?

35:35.990 --> 35:38.168
That'll go down well with
the Police Integrity Commission.

35:38.169 --> 35:39.588
It's your savage sexuality, Browney.

35:39.589 --> 35:41.428
It must have
driven her insane, mate.

35:41.429 --> 35:43.710
Oh, does that mean she was lying
about the shirt too?

35:43.711 --> 35:45.769
Maybe, maybe not.

35:45.770 --> 35:47.750
Strike Force Tuno.

35:49.450 --> 35:50.469
Right.

35:50.470 --> 35:55.310
Uh, Jase Falconer's just attacked
his aunty with an antique iron.

35:56.810 --> 35:58.190
Come with me.

35:59.119 --> 36:03.418
She showed every single biker in
town that letter, every single one.

36:03.483 --> 36:05.102
She got Dad killed.

36:05.103 --> 36:07.023
He nearly killed me,
that bloody little animal!

36:07.024 --> 36:10.082
Well, what did you expect,
when you go around sledging his dad?

36:10.083 --> 36:12.082
Oh, God, I didn't do that.

36:12.083 --> 36:14.622
Don't talk shit to me, Dianne.

36:14.623 --> 36:17.642
Alright? You sold Terry down
the river. You called him a dog.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.382
I never thought he'd get...

36:19.383 --> 36:21.541
I never thought anything bad
would happen to him.

36:21.542 --> 36:23.501
Well, I tell you what
I want to know. Why'd you do it?

36:23.502 --> 36:25.583
You want him out of the way to get
a piece of his old drug business?

36:25.584 --> 36:28.122
Is that the deal?
No. No.

36:28.123 --> 36:29.503
I just...

36:30.523 --> 36:33.342
The clubs got paranoid, you know?

36:33.343 --> 36:36.282
And they started thinking
I was a dog, and I'm not.

36:36.283 --> 36:37.743
I'm not. I just...

36:38.943 --> 36:42.023
I just wanted to point 'em away
so I could feel safe.

36:43.343 --> 36:45.863
But I never meant
for him to be hurt.

36:47.383 --> 36:50.462
You're never gonna catch
who killed him, are ya?

36:50.463 --> 36:53.422
We're just Westie lowlifes
with a shitty crook for a dad.

36:53.423 --> 36:55.983
Who cares if someone like him
gets chopped to pieces?

37:02.383 --> 37:04.542
Well, how am I
supposed to do the job

37:04.543 --> 37:06.461
when you've cut half my staff
before we get to square one?

37:06.462 --> 37:07.941
You can't argue
with the budget.

37:07.942 --> 37:10.061
I can't do what you've asked me.
Am I talking to a brick wall?

37:10.062 --> 37:11.743
I want my strongest
objection registered.

37:11.744 --> 37:15.103
Go home, Gary.
Just go home, take a cold shower.

37:17.863 --> 37:20.462
All the money you save, buy yourself
a pair of fuckin' glasses, you...

37:20.463 --> 37:23.182
Tuno going well?
Oh, no, it's going great.

37:23.183 --> 37:25.922
I've just been told half my staff
are being returned to their squads.

37:25.923 --> 37:28.062
I can take over if you like.

37:28.063 --> 37:30.703
Would you like to
have dinner with me, Pam?

37:31.743 --> 37:34.522
Oh! I can't imagine
what we'd talk about.

37:34.523 --> 37:36.002
Well, we're Homicide.

37:36.003 --> 37:38.602
Detective sergeants.

37:38.603 --> 37:40.102
Probably got a lot in common.

37:40.103 --> 37:42.663
Yeah, and I can hear
the office gossip from here.

37:44.683 --> 37:47.062
So, is that a yes?

37:47.063 --> 37:49.302
There's gotta be
someone big behind this.

37:49.303 --> 37:52.663
An ordinary crook doesn't
pull off a hit so elaborate.

37:54.883 --> 37:57.463
Um, the barramundi, please.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.263
I'll just get the snapper, mate.

38:01.503 --> 38:03.702
So what sort of films
do you like, Gary?

38:03.703 --> 38:05.501
I mean, I really like
the latest Woody Allen...

38:05.502 --> 38:07.381
They're not gonna put me off.
I'm gonna get this fella.

38:07.382 --> 38:09.261
It's called 'Curse of the
Jade Scorpion'. Very funny.

38:09.262 --> 38:10.923
They're not gonna shut down Tuno
on my watch, Pam.

38:10.924 --> 38:12.383
It's not gonna happen.

38:17.663 --> 38:21.242
Gary, since when do you even have
the power to decide which cases run?

38:21.243 --> 38:23.222
This is a bad crime.

38:23.223 --> 38:25.762
There's bad crime everywhere.
It happens all the time.

38:25.763 --> 38:28.182
There's not enough resources.

38:28.183 --> 38:30.543
So, if you don't have a result soon,
then Tuno will close.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.982
Of course, there's your reputation.

38:36.983 --> 38:39.422
And what does that mean,
my reputation?

38:39.423 --> 38:43.283
You're the patron saint
of lost causes.

38:45.383 --> 38:48.663
Is that right, is it?
Mm-hm.

39:36.783 --> 39:40.142
Anthony Perish called
his business 'The Company'.

39:40.143 --> 39:44.262
Although its profits were in
the millions, it had no head office,

39:44.263 --> 39:47.402
no business plan,
no corporate structure.

39:47.403 --> 39:52.062
Anthony was CEO, sole shareholder.

39:52.063 --> 39:54.482
And there was only
one company rule...

39:54.483 --> 39:55.982
if you crossed him...

39:55.983 --> 39:58.503
you'd pay.

39:59.843 --> 40:01.502
So, while some in the underworld

40:01.503 --> 40:04.822
knew or suspected he was behind
Terry Falconer's murder,

40:04.823 --> 40:07.022
none was game to speak out
against a man

40:07.023 --> 40:09.003
who could string up
a human being on a meat hook

40:09.004 --> 40:11.783
and butcher him like a beast.

40:13.543 --> 40:18.182
But Anthony Perish
had one piece of bad luck.

40:18.183 --> 40:22.543
Gary Jubelin was a man
who never gave up.

40:24.123 --> 40:25.383
Frank O'Rourke?

40:26.943 --> 40:30.502
Detectives Browne and Rankin
from Strike Force Tuno.

40:30.503 --> 40:32.643
We've got some questions about
the murder of Terry Falconer...

40:32.644 --> 40:34.103
I know why you're here.

40:42.083 --> 40:44.263
I know who killed Terry Falconer.

40:46.383 --> 40:48.203
Mr O'Rourke, do you think
we could come inside?

40:48.204 --> 40:50.022
I'm not saying anything here.

40:50.023 --> 40:52.743
I'm as good as dead
just talking to ya.

40:56.703 --> 41:00.142
Meet me at the parkland
off Cowpasture Road, 9pm.

41:00.143 --> 41:01.962
Mr O'Rourke...
Just you two.

41:01.963 --> 41:04.143
Anyone else, I piss off.

41:05.283 --> 41:07.263
Go. Fuck off.

41:09.058 --> 41:13.177
How did we get this guy's name?
He's another bikie. Iron Blood.

41:13.232 --> 41:15.712
He's not long out of jail, fellas.
Have a look at this.

41:15.713 --> 41:18.391
Eight years for manslaughter,
and he's got form for assault,

41:18.392 --> 41:20.571
assault police officer,
possession of firearms.

41:20.572 --> 41:23.111
He's gonna be there in 40 minutes.

41:23.112 --> 41:26.071
He also did some of his time
in the same jail as Falconer.

41:26.072 --> 41:28.832
Jase, you ring Browney
every 20 minutes.

42:20.332 --> 42:21.792
Youse are alone?

42:37.032 --> 42:39.411
You know stuff
about Falconer's murder?

42:39.412 --> 42:42.072
Yeah. Yeah, I know stuff.

42:48.692 --> 42:50.851
I know it all.

42:50.852 --> 42:52.632
You know who killed him?

43:03.892 --> 43:05.392
Who killed him?

43:12.112 --> 43:14.632
Mr O'Rourke,
are we wasting our time?

43:27.452 --> 43:29.591
Anthony Perish.

43:29.592 --> 43:33.432
Anthony Perish
killed Terry Falconer.

43:41.172 --> 43:43.531
Who's Anthony Perish?

43:43.532 --> 43:45.391
After three long months,

43:45.392 --> 43:49.131
Strike Force Tuno finally had
a name for their murderer.

43:49.132 --> 43:51.392
There was only one small problem...

43:52.592 --> 43:54.772
it was a name
they'd never heard of.

44:03.208 --> 44:05.088
Anthony Perish hasn't ever had
an account with Telstra.

44:06.108 --> 44:08.088
No super fund has any record of him.

44:08.089 --> 44:11.168
He's got no outstanding fines,
no traffic infringements.

44:13.048 --> 44:14.848
He's not registered
with the Housing Commission,

44:14.849 --> 44:16.888
Medicare
or any private health fund.

44:17.928 --> 44:19.188
He's never applied for a loan
or a lease.

44:19.189 --> 44:21.487
He's never donated blood.

44:21.488 --> 44:24.547
He's not on the electoral roll,
got no tax file number,

44:24.548 --> 44:25.628
no credit history.

44:25.629 --> 44:27.327
I've never seen anything like it.

44:27.328 --> 44:30.448
I need you to know I am not
the easiest person to be with.

44:31.648 --> 44:34.487
Only someone
with serious badness to hide

44:34.488 --> 44:36.808
would go to this much effort
to cover their tracks.

44:38.248 --> 44:39.686
I reckon you got two voices
in your head

44:39.687 --> 44:41.228
telling you
two very different things.

44:41.229 --> 44:43.147
Just two?

44:43.148 --> 44:46.728
Happy days.

45:11.548 --> 45:12.967
Take a look at this.

45:12.968 --> 45:16.248
These are the ones
who killed Terry Falconer.

45:17.448 --> 45:19.748
He's only the biggest speed and
eccie producer in the whole country,

45:19.749 --> 45:20.967
isn't he?

45:20.968 --> 45:22.886
Anthony Perish is a foul-mouthed
petty criminal

45:22.887 --> 45:25.188
who hasn't been seen or heard of
in over 10 years.

45:27.348 --> 45:28.528
Hey?!

45:30.728 --> 45:32.987
And so,
you never accepted any of the money?

45:32.988 --> 45:34.888
Of course I fucking did.

45:43.088 --> 45:45.187
Are you offering to wear a wire?
Huh?

45:45.188 --> 45:46.808
Babe?

45:48.028 --> 45:49.888
You don't have to do this, you know?

45:52.688 --> 45:55.067
Come on, come and get me,
you bastard!

45:55.068 --> 45:56.648
I'm not afraid of you!

45:57.888 --> 46:00.968
And I'm just crazy enough
to pull that trigger, eh? Huh?

46:06.088 --> 46:07.648
I know what they're capable of,
alright?

46:07.649 --> 46:10.647
Every time I front them dudes,
I risk my life. Don't you get that?

46:10.648 --> 46:12.048
It's the right thing to do -
you know it.

46:17.288 --> 46:19.407
You're scaring me.
You ought to be scared, eh?

46:19.408 --> 46:22.587
No, you - you're scaring me.
Hey, inside.

46:22.588 --> 46:24.907
I'll do it.

46:24.908 --> 46:27.048
Who's been talking?

46:29.528 --> 46:33.187
You idiots don't understand a thing,
alright? Now get out!

46:33.814 --> 46:35.393
Get.

46:35.394 --> 46:37.813
You told me you didn't wanna
go back to that life.

46:37.867 --> 46:39.987
Doesn't mean I wanna be a dog,
either.

46:42.291 --> 46:44.551
But you do wanna be a better man.

46:46.908 --> 47:02.373
