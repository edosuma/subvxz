WEBVTT

00:02.794 --> 00:04.213
HELLO!

00:04.213 --> 00:06.173
GUYS! ANYONE HOME?

00:06.173 --> 00:09.510
I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.094
(gasps)

00:11.094 --> 00:12.971
(gasps) OH! WHOA! AAH!

00:12.971 --> 00:14.973
(boxes thud)
OW!

00:17.059 --> 00:19.186
(Hilda) BETTY?
AH.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.604
YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:20.604 --> 00:24.149
IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE NOT.
WE HAVE A NURSE NOW.
WHAT?

00:24.149 --> 00:26.193
BETTY, MEET ELENA.

00:26.193 --> 00:29.613
OH, HI!
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.074
OH... SO NICE
TO MEET YOU, TOO.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.451
I... (groans) WELL,
WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.454
THE LADY AT THE MEDICAID OFFICE
SAID YOU WERE THE BEST NURSE

00:37.454 --> 00:40.457
IN ALL OF QUEENS.
THAT'S MY COUSIN STELLA.
SHE EXAGGERATES.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.042
I'M NOT THE BEST.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.544
MAYBE TOP FIVE.
(all laugh)

00:43.544 --> 00:45.170
JUST TWO BOXES, <i>MIJA?</i>

00:45.170 --> 00:46.547
HEY!
<i>PAPI!</i>

00:46.547 --> 00:49.758
<i>PAPI,</i> I WILL GET IT DONE.
IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.761
AND BESIDES, I CAN'T REALLY
MOVE OUT OF MY APARTMENT

00:52.761 --> 00:54.763
UNTIL I FIND SOMEONE
TO SUBLET IT,

00:54.763 --> 00:57.891
AND IT'S NOT EASY
TO FIND SOMEONE YOU TRUST.
I'LL MOVE IN WITH AMANDA.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.060
NO!
CAN WE AT LEAST
TALK ABOUT IT?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.186
UH... NO!

01:01.186 --> 01:03.188
WELL, YOU BETTER CHOOSE
CAREFULLY.

01:03.188 --> 01:07.025
YOU DON'T WANT A CRAZY PERSON
LIVING IN THERE.
YOU MEAN <i>ANOTHER</i> CRAZY PERSON?

01:07.025 --> 01:09.027
SEE, AMANDA JUST
BOUGHT HER DOG A WATCH

01:09.027 --> 01:11.113
BECAUSE SHE SAYS
HE'S ALWAYS LATE.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.740
OH, ELENA, I JUST GOT
THIS NEW CONDITIONER IN.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.993
DO YOU LIKE YOUR HAIR
TO SMELL LIKE FRUIT?

01:15.993 --> 01:19.079
<i>MIJA,</i> YOU'VE BEEN TAKING
A LONG TIME WITH THIS MOVE.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.039
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH COMING HOME?

01:21.039 --> 01:23.000
YES, I WANT TO BE HERE.
I WANT TO BE CLOSE TO YOU GUYS.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.960
AND, YOU KNOW,
WITH ALL THE MONEY I'M SAVING,

01:24.960 --> 01:26.962
IT'S REALLY GONNA HELP
AROUND HERE.

01:26.962 --> 01:29.256
(teakettle whistling)
AH! THAT'S THE WATER
FOR MY TEA.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.134
NO!
<i>PAPI,</i> SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
BETTY, I GOT IT.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.303
YOU GO FINISH
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.
REALLY?

01:34.303 --> 01:37.097
YEAH.
OKAY, WELL, THEN I'M JUST
GONNA HEAD BACK INTO THE CITY

01:37.097 --> 01:39.099
'CAUSE AMANDA AND I
ARE INTERVIEWING ROOMMATES.
OH.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.102
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. ELENA,
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.562
THANK YOU. BYE, <i>PAPI.</i>
OKAY.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.896
BYE! BYE!
(Hilda) BYE!

01:44.896 --> 01:46.106
BYE!
(Justin) BYE!

01:46.106 --> 01:48.734
YOU GOT GREAT KIDS.
(sighs) I DO, THANK YOU.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.570
<i>DAME ESO.</i>
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL‐‐

01:51.570 --> 01:52.571
MM‐HMM.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.573
THEY ALL WORRY ABOUT ME
TOO MUCH.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.200
THAT'S THE REAL REASON
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.661
I, UM, DON'T NEED
ANY HELP.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.830
(laughs)
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.832
OH, I BARELY USE THIS STUFF.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.208
TRUST ME...

02:05.208 --> 02:08.962
THIS'LL BE THE EASIEST JOB
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.964
(man) HERE YOU GO.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.133
(Daniel) THANKS.
THANK YOU.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.177
(coins rattle)
(laughs) EXCUSE ME!

02:15.177 --> 02:18.347
DID YOU JUST TOSS YOUR CHANGE
IN THE GARBAGE?

02:18.347 --> 02:19.806
NO.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.767
LIAR, YOU TOTALLY DID.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.935
WHAT? IT WAS 7 CENTS.
I HATE PENNIES.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.396
DO YOU HATE NICKELS, TOO,
RICH JERK?

02:26.396 --> 02:27.981
(laughs) COME ON!

02:27.981 --> 02:29.983
RICH JERK IS CUTE.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.985
HOW ABOUT "R. J."
FOR SHORT?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.988
OKAY, I'M GONNA COME UP
WITH A NICKNAME FOR YOU.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.990
(chuckles) OKAY.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.993
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHAT I COME UP WITH.
(laughs)

02:39.993 --> 02:41.995
HAVE A SEAT FOR A SECOND.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.581
LOOK, I...

02:44.581 --> 02:47.542
I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE
ANY SECRETS BETWEEN US.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.877
OOH.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.712
TONE CHANGE.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.382
YOU'RE‐‐
YOU'RE GETTING SERIOUS?

02:53.382 --> 02:57.094
CONNOR HAS STARTED SEEING
WILHELMINA.

02:57.094 --> 03:01.264
HE DOESN'T KNOW I KNOW.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.558
ARE YOU OKAY?

03:03.558 --> 03:05.644
YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM.

03:05.644 --> 03:10.857
IN FACT,
I HOPE THEY'RE HAPPY.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.029
SO DOES THIS MEAN WE CAN TELL
CONNOR ABOUT YOU AND ME?

03:16.029 --> 03:19.449
WE SHOULD. I THINK I SHOULD BE
THE ONE TO TELL HIM.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.451
AND I THINK
IT SHOULD BE SOON.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.704
BETTER THAN HIM
FINDING OUT SOME OTHER WAY.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.206
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW AWFUL IT WOULD BE

03:26.206 --> 03:29.626
IF HE SAW THAT PHOTO OF US
ON "PAGE SIX"?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.557
DARLING, GREAT NEWS.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.269
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH GRAYDON.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.063
HE GOT US OUR FAVORITE TABLE
AT THE WAVERLY INN.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.690
OH. THAT'S GREAT.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.692
WELL, THEY BUMPED
JENNIFER ANISTON.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.027
SHE ALWAYS CRIES
AT THAT TABLE.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.821
EVERYTHING OKAY?

03:57.821 --> 04:00.323
YOU... SEEM A BIT DISTRACTED.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.033
NO.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.995
THE ONLY THING
DISTRACTING ME TONIGHT

04:04.995 --> 04:07.539
IS YOU.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.166
MM.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.877
MM.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.755
(sighs) AND THAT BUDGET REPORT
I FORGOT TO REVIEW.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.757
WELL, YOU CAN DO IT
TOMORROW.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.926
IT'S MY FIRST MEETING
OF THE MORNING.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.345
AND IT'S GETTING LATE.
I'VE GOTTA GO.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.766
BUT I‐I JUST MADE
RESERVATIONS.
I'M SORRY, WILLIE.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.142
I TELL YOU WHAT,

04:27.142 --> 04:29.811
I'LL BOOK A TABLE
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.105
I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.821
(door closes)

04:39.821 --> 04:43.408
♪♪♪

04:43.408 --> 04:45.368
(Amanda) YOU'RE PERFECT.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.370
AND I LOVE
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

04:47.370 --> 04:51.249
I'M GONNA BORROW IT TOMORROW
WHEN YOU MOVE IN, OKAY?
(Betty) UH, JUST REAL QUICK.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.127
IT SAYS HERE YOU'VE LIVED
IN FIVE DIFFERENT PLACES

04:54.127 --> 04:56.087
IN TWO YEARS?

04:56.087 --> 04:58.089
YEAH, SEE,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

04:58.089 --> 05:01.343
A LITTLE BIT MORE STABLE,
BUT THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.720
UH, COOKIE TO GO?
(laughs) NOT A PROBLEM!

05:03.720 --> 05:06.973
I LIKE TO WALK
AROUND NAKED, TOO.
YEAH, BUT, SEE,

05:06.973 --> 05:09.518
I OWN THE FURNITURE, AND I'M
NOT REALLY DOWN WITH THAT.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.312
SO... (chuckles) COOKIE?
SMILE!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.022
(shutter clicking)

05:14.022 --> 05:15.816
YOU'RE PERFECT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.400
YOU'RE PERFECT!
COOKIE?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.237
(camera beeps, shutter snaps)
SHE IS MISSING
HER 2006 TAX RETURN.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.864
THAT'S A SECURITY RISK.
BUT SHE IS <i>SO</i> PRETTY.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.616
BUT YET NOT PRETTY ENOUGH

05:24.616 --> 05:26.618
FOR ME TO FEEL THREATENED
BY HER.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.162
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK
I'M INTERESTED ANYMORE.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.789
OH.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.375
HALSTON, EW.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.668
EW.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.087
BETTY, WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO PICKY?

05:37.087 --> 05:39.089
EXCEPT FOR
TINY‐BABY‐TEETH GIRL,

05:39.089 --> 05:40.840
I COULD'VE LIVED
WITH ANY OF THESE PEOPLE.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.592
AMANDA, MY NAME
IS STILL ON THE LEASE.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.136
WE HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE,

05:45.136 --> 05:47.138
YOU KNOW, WHO CAN PAY
THE RENT ON TIME,

05:47.138 --> 05:50.600
THAT SORT OF THING.
YOU WERE ALWAYS GOOD
AT BORING STUFF LIKE THAT.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.977
OH, MAN...

05:51.977 --> 05:55.188
I AM REALLY GONNA MISS
THIS PLACE.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.190
IT'S LIKE I HAD THIS FANTASY

05:57.190 --> 06:00.151
OF WHAT MY LIFE
WOULD BE LIKE HERE.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.612
NOW IT'S ENDING
BEFORE IT EVEN STARTED.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.989
(guitar strumming)

06:03.989 --> 06:06.616
(Jesse singing indistinctly)

06:06.616 --> 06:10.412
SPEAKING OF THINGS
THAT NEVER STARTED...

06:10.412 --> 06:13.415
(guitar strumming
and singing continue)

06:13.415 --> 06:14.875
MOVE.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.962
(singing indistinctly)

06:18.962 --> 06:22.007
OH... JESSE.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.384
I'D BET YOU'D LIKE
TO SMASH THAT GUITAR

06:24.384 --> 06:26.011
OVER HIS BEDHEAD.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.014
NO, I DON'T HATE HIM.
WELL, YOU SHOULD.
HE TOTALLY LED YOU ON.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.433
DID HE?
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE HE KNEW

06:31.433 --> 06:33.435
THAT I THREW THAT PARTY
ON THE ROOF

06:33.435 --> 06:35.437
<i>JUST</i> SO THAT
HIS BAND COULD PLAY.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.938
AND TO BE FAIR, I NEVER EVEN
TOLD HIM THAT I LIKED HIM.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.440
SO THEN WHY HAVE YOU
BEEN ACTING

06:38.440 --> 06:42.068
ALL WEIRD AND AVOID‐Y
FOR THE LAST MONTH?
I DON'T KNOW.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.155
YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO HIM
RIGHT NOW.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.823
I CAN'T DO THAT.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.950
YES, YOU CAN.

06:50.994 --> 06:54.205
WELL... I MEAN, I GUESS
I SHOULD TALK TO HIM, YOU KNOW?

06:54.205 --> 06:57.417
JUST‐‐BEFORE I LEAVE,
TO CLEAR THE AIR.
TOTALLY.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.670
OKAY, YEAH. CLOSURE.
YEP.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.380
(gasps)
OKAY, I GOTTA RUN.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.382
BETTY,
THIS IS VERY BIG OF YOU.

07:04.382 --> 07:08.053
AND UNLIKE IN THE PAST,
I MEAN THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.971
JESSE!

07:09.971 --> 07:12.349
BETTY, HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.434
GOOD, GOOD.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.271
UH... WHY ARE YOU PRACTICING
IN THE HALLWAY?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.273
WELL, I JUST REPAINTED
MY KITCHEN.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.817
THERE WAS A GREASE FIRE
GONE WILD, SO...

07:22.817 --> 07:24.736
DON'T ASK.
OH.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.405
LOTS OF PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT
OF YOUR APARTMENT.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.407
YEAH, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A SUBLETTER.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.409
I'M MOVING OUT.
WHA‐‐WHY?

07:31.409 --> 07:35.038
WELL, MY DAD
HAD A HEART ATTACK, AND...
OH, MY GOD. IS HE OKAY?

07:35.038 --> 07:37.040
Y‐YEAH, HE'S BETTER NOW.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.334
AND I'M JUST MOVING BACK
TO HELP OUT.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.711
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD PERSON.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.005
WOW, I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU'RE LEAVING.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.591
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T
SEEN EACH OTHER IN FOREVER.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.177
I KNOW. A‐AND I WAS, UH,
JUST THINKING, YOU KNOW,

07:49.177 --> 07:52.931
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT‐‐
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO HAVE
A FAREWELL DRINK.

07:52.931 --> 07:56.184
A DRINK? SURE.
YEAH, I'D INVITE YOU
TO MY PLACE,

07:56.184 --> 07:58.103
BUT, YOU KNOW,
FUMES... DEATH.

07:58.103 --> 08:02.190
YEAH, WELL, WE CAN HANG
IN MY PLACE IF YOU'D LIKE.
PERFECT. YES.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.192
ALL RIGHT.
COOL.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.195
(Jesse) YOU CAN CALL MY MOM
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.
(Betty laughs)

08:07.195 --> 08:10.699
I WENT TO BALLET CAMP
TWO SUMMERS IN A ROW.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.243
OKAY, OKAY,
I BELIEVE YOU.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.870
I MISSED YOU, BETTY ROCKER.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

08:15.870 --> 08:18.373
WELL, ABOUT THAT, UM...

08:18.373 --> 08:22.085
SO REMEMBER THAT NIGHT
ON THE ROOF?

08:22.085 --> 08:24.087
OF COURSE YOU REMEMBER IT.

08:24.087 --> 08:27.215
UM... THAT WAS KIND OF
AN AWKWARD NIGHT FOR ME.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.259
AH... (stammers)
WHAT?

08:29.259 --> 08:32.262
NO, NO, I THINK SOMETIMES,
YOU AND I, WE SHARE A BRAIN.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.764
'CAUSE I TOTALLY‐‐I HAVE A SONG
CALLED "AWKWARD NIGHT."

08:34.764 --> 08:37.016
OH, YOU DO?
YEAH, YEAH.

BUT BEFORE I LEAVE‐‐
I‐I HATE THAT YOU'RE
NOT GONNA BE HERE ANYMORE.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.774
YOU KNOW, YOUR FAMILY
IS SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.
OKAY, STOP.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.776
NO, NO, I MEAN IT.
(laughs)

09:27.776 --> 09:31.613
I‐I‐I‐I KNOW I FEEL BETTER
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.493
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW LATE IT GOT.
YEAH.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.515
I SHOULD‐‐I SHOULD‐‐
I GOTTA GET GOING, SO...

09:38.515 --> 09:40.538
YEAH, DEFINITELY.
OH! (chuckles)

09:54.886 --> 09:57.889
♪♪♪

10:11.861 --> 10:14.197
(groans)

10:14.197 --> 10:16.533
GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.243
AMANDA...

10:18.243 --> 10:20.787
WHAT HAPPENED?
I FELL ASLEEP ON THE COUCH?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.957
I GUESS SO.
I'M JUST GETTING HOME MYSELF.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.584
HOW WAS YOUR TALK WITH JESSE
LAST NIGHT?

10:26.584 --> 10:29.295
UM... (sighs)
IT WAS GOOD.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.047
IT WAS... REALLY GOOD.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.049
UM, WE WERE TALKING,

10:33.049 --> 10:35.343
AND, YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT,

10:35.343 --> 10:37.345
AND THEN... HE KISSED ME.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.472
(gasps) WHAT?

10:39.472 --> 10:40.890
OKAY.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.434
WHERE IS HE? HOW IS HE?
WHAT'S HE PACKING?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.395
NO, NO, HE LEFT
AFTER WE KISSED.
OH.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.439
WAIT, BETTY, WHAT HAPPENED?
WAS IT YOUR BREATH AGAIN?

10:48.439 --> 10:50.859
NO, I TOLD HIM I HAD TO GET UP
EARLY TO GO TO WORK.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.861
IT WAS ALL VERY CONFUSING.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.321
WHY? YOU HAD THE KIND OF DATE
ANY FOURTH GRADER WOULD DIE FOR.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.323
LOOK, I THOUGHT
HE DIDN'T LIKE ME

10:57.323 --> 10:59.367
AFTER ALL THAT "MODE"
AFTER PARTY STUFF.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.703
AND THEN HE KISSES ME?
WHAT IS THAT?

11:01.703 --> 11:04.747
OKAY, SQUEAKY,
THIS ONE IS A TOUGHIE.

11:04.747 --> 11:08.001
BUT BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,
WE NEED A MALE POINT OF VIEW.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.714
OKAY, SO I COULDN'T FIND
A MALE POINT OF VIEW,

11:12.714 --> 11:14.132
BUT I DID FIND MARC.
OH.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.551
FIRST QUESTION‐‐
WHERE DID JESSE KISS YOU?

11:16.551 --> 11:17.927
ON MY COUCH.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.138
AND THAT'S NOT
A EUPHEMISM FOR, UH...

11:20.138 --> 11:21.806
OH! NO!
OH, GOOD.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.766
MOVE ON.
IS IT POSSIBLE

11:23.766 --> 11:26.769
THAT HE WAS JUST LICKING
GUACAMOLE OFF OUR CHIN?
OH.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.771
YOU ARE KNOWN TO HAVE
FOOD SITUATIONS.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.191
NOPE, I WASN'T EVEN EATING.
NOT EATING?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.818
THIS STORY IS GETTING
MORE AND MORE PREPOSTEROUS.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.696
OKAY, NEXT QUESTION‐‐
NUMBER OF DRINKS CONSUMED.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.781
(sighs) UM... THREE?

11:38.781 --> 11:41.075
HMM... I'M HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE VISUALIZING.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.077
WE NEED TO RECREATE
THE SCENE.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.371
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.
YES.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.373
OKAY, BETTY,
PRETEND I'M JESSE.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.084
COME HERE
AND SIT ON DADDY'S LAP.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.336
NO.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.962
OKAY, I'LL BE BETTY.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.675
GUYS, I WASN'T SITTING
ON HIS LAP.

11:57.675 --> 11:58.718
SHH!

11:58.718 --> 12:00.428
(high‐pitched voice)
<i>HOLA,</i> JESSE.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.804
HEY, BETTY,

12:01.804 --> 12:04.891
I'M SUCH A SENSITIVE
SINGER/SONGWRITER.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.936
I'M AWESOME.
YOU WANNA WATCH ME...

12:07.936 --> 12:10.480
PLAY MY GUITAR?
I'D RATHER MAKE OUT
WITH YOU.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.440
WELL, I HAVE HAD
A FEW DRINKS.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.775
OKAY.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.276
MMM...
MMM...

12:15.276 --> 12:16.819
LA, LA, LA.
(chuckles)

12:16.819 --> 12:17.987
MMM, MMM.

12:20.156 --> 12:24.077
(kissing sounds)

12:24.077 --> 12:25.912
(Betty clears throat)

12:25.912 --> 12:27.914
OKAY, I'VE REACHED
A CONCLUSION.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.958
(normal voice)
AS HAVE I.

12:29.958 --> 12:33.419
IF JESSE WAS ABLE TO GET PAST
ALL OF THIS...

12:33.419 --> 12:35.171
THEN...

12:35.171 --> 12:37.674
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
BETWEEN YOU!
AGREED.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.677
REALLY?
OR HE COULD'VE JUST
BEEN DRUNK OFF HIS ASS.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.262
AGREED. TA.
TA.

12:46.724 --> 12:47.892
(hands clapping)

12:47.892 --> 12:50.895
OKAY, IT'S 9:00 A. M.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.939
YEAH,
TIME FOR MY MORNING NAP.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.941
NOPE. YOUR MORNING WALK.
MORNING WALK?

12:54.941 --> 12:56.943
MM‐HMM.
IT'S 30 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.945
NOT UP FOR DISCUSSION.
WHAT?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.947
COME ON. GET UP.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.573
COME ON.
HILDA! <i>HILDA!</i>

13:02.573 --> 13:04.701
HILDA!
WHAT?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.577
ELENA WANTS ME
TO GO FOR A WALK.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.454
I JUST WANT TO TAKE HIM
FOR A LITTLE WALK.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.457
DO YOU REALIZE HOW COLD IT IS
OUTSIDE? 30 DEGREES, MAMA!
HE NEEDS THE FRESH AIR!

13:11.457 --> 13:12.959
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY!

13:12.959 --> 13:15.295
<i>PAPI,</i> IT'S JUST A WALK,
RIGHT? WE'LL ALL GO!

13:15.295 --> 13:17.463
JUSTIN, WE'RE GOING
FOR A WALK!

13:19.549 --> 13:22.135
SO JESSE KISSED YOU, HUH?
WOW.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.429
<i>BIG</i> WOW.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.390
AND, I MEAN, I WAS TRYING
TO CLOSE THAT DOOR,

13:27.390 --> 13:29.767
BUT THEN HE WENT
AND OPENED IT ALL BACK UP.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.978
AND THAT'S JUST GONNA
MAKE IT HARDER FOR ME

13:31.978 --> 13:33.604
TO LEAVE MY APARTMENT.

13:33.604 --> 13:36.774
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE KISS MEANT?
WHAT, HONESTLY?

13:36.774 --> 13:38.776
MM‐HMM, YEAH, HONESTLY.
WELL... (clears throat)

13:38.776 --> 13:41.487
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
A DRUNKEN KISS IS JUST THAT...

13:41.487 --> 13:42.864
A DRUNKEN KISS.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.907
GUYS ARE DOGS.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.578
COLD NIGHT, WARM GIRL,
A COUPLE OF DRINKS...

13:48.578 --> 13:50.371
YEAH, I GET IT.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.957
BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE...
HE'S NOT LIKE YOU.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.960
MAYBE HE'S A NICE GUY.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.546
SORRY.
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.548
LOOK, THE ONLY WAY
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT

14:00.548 --> 14:03.551
IS IF YOU ASK HIM.
WELL, I GUESS
I CAN DO THAT.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.762
I'M AN ADULT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.847
EITHER WAY,
I'M FINE WITH IT.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.182
I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.809
"TO MY RICH JERK."

14:11.809 --> 14:13.519
IT'S FROM MOLLY.
(laughs)

14:13.519 --> 14:15.563
"RICH JERK." HMM... CUTE.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.733
AND... A LITTLE INSULTING?

14:18.733 --> 14:20.777
NO, SHE'S JUST TEASING.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.779
HEY, WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

14:22.779 --> 14:25.782
I WANT TO SEND SOME FLOWERS
TO HER AS A THANK‐YOU,

14:25.782 --> 14:27.784
BUT, MM, MAKE SURE
THEY'RE NOT TOO NICE.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.161
I DON'T WANT HER
TO THINK I'M A RICH JERK.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.331
SO... THINGS BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU, THEY'RE GOOD?

14:33.331 --> 14:34.957
THEY'RE GOING GREAT.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.627
I JUST REALLY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
THE RIGHT TIME TO TELL‐‐

14:37.627 --> 14:40.922
CONNOR, HEY.
MATE, YOU UP FOR HITTING
THE GYM AFTER WORK?

14:40.922 --> 14:43.007
SOUNDS GREAT.
LET'S DO IT, MATE.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.553
WAS I OVERLY ENTHUSIASTIC?

14:47.553 --> 14:49.555
YOU SAID "MATE."

14:49.555 --> 14:50.890
(sighs)

14:50.890 --> 14:52.892
DINNER FOR TWO
FROM THE WAVERLY INN

14:52.892 --> 14:54.519
HAS BEEN ORDERED,

14:54.519 --> 14:56.562
DROPPED OFF AT YOUR PLACE
AT 8:00 AND‐‐
STOP.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.356
STAY. GOOD BOY.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.941
OH, CONNOR.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.442
CONNOR, I WAS THINKING,

15:01.442 --> 15:04.862
UM, WHY DON'T WE ORDER IN
TONIGHT?

15:04.862 --> 15:08.074
TEMPTING. UM, BUT I'VE ALREADY
MADE PLANS WITH DANIEL.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.159
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, LOVE.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.665
MARC.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.209
WAS I JUST... DISSED?

15:18.209 --> 15:20.711
NO, NO. YES.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.755
SOMETHING'S CHANGED, MARC.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.300
I FEEL HIM SLIPPING AWAY.
(sighs)

15:26.300 --> 15:29.637
CANCEL WHATEVER PARADE
YOU'RE GOING TO AND...

15:29.637 --> 15:33.516
I NEED YOU TO FIND OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.684
HMM.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.353
(sighs) GO GET 'EM, BOY.
(barks)

15:37.353 --> 15:38.813
OKAY.

15:38.813 --> 15:42.233
WHY DON'T WE GO GET A BEER?
MAYBE JUST... TALK?

15:42.233 --> 15:44.235
MATE, I KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY.

15:44.235 --> 15:47.238
YOU'VE JUST BEEN LOOKING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO SAY IT.

15:47.238 --> 15:51.909
WELL, I‐I DON'T REALLY KNOW
IF NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.369
ALL RIGHT.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.580
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO SAY IT, I WILL.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.206
I'VE BEEN DISTRACTED.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.542
MY PERFORMANCE
HAS BEEN SUFFERING,

15:59.542 --> 16:01.544
AND I'M SORRY.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.380
IT'S MOLLY.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.843
CONNOR, I KNOW BREAKUPS
CAN BE REALLY HARD...

16:08.843 --> 16:10.803
YEAH, TRUE, BUT, UH...

16:10.803 --> 16:13.055
IT'S SOMETHING I FOUND
THAT'S BEEN BOTHERING ME.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.892
LOOK AT THAT.
UH, WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S, UM...

16:15.892 --> 16:18.019
IT'S MOLLY IN ST. BARTHS.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.521
AND‐‐AND LOOK AT THE HAND
SHE'S HOLDING.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.565
SHE'S WITH A MAN.
ARE YOU SURE?

16:22.565 --> 16:24.567
WELL, THE FINGERS
<i>ARE</i> FEMININE,

16:24.567 --> 16:27.570
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
A MAN'S HAND.
WELL, THEY'RE NOT FEMININE.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.947
UM, WELL‐MANICURED MAYBE,
BUT NOT FEMININE.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.533
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHO IT MIGHT‐‐MIGHT BE?

16:32.533 --> 16:35.203
NO.

16:35.203 --> 16:39.582
NO. BUT SHE'S ALREADY
VACATIONING WITH ANOTHER MAN?

16:39.582 --> 16:41.792
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

16:41.792 --> 16:45.922
MATE, IF SHE WAS SEEING SOMEBODY
BEFORE WE BROKE UP,

16:45.922 --> 16:47.715
THAT WOULD ROYALLY...

16:47.715 --> 16:49.717
PISS ME OFF.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.803
SOMEBODY DEFINITELY NEEDS
A DRINK. COME ON.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.180
RIGHT.
(chuckles) RIGHT.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.766
OKAY. DO YOU MIND IF WE
STOP SOMEWHERE ON THE WAY?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.309
UH, SURE. WHERE?

16:58.309 --> 17:01.103
OH, I JUST NEED
TO CHECK SOMETHING.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.732
(guitar strumming)

17:04.732 --> 17:06.984
(Betty) UH, I WAS GONNA
DO THIS BY MYSELF.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.736
RIGHT. RIGHT.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.155
I'LL JUST LISTEN
FROM INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.782
GO GET HIM!

17:12.782 --> 17:14.158
(guitar strumming continues)

17:14.158 --> 17:17.745
(sighs) OKAY.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.372
(guitar strumming stops)

17:19.372 --> 17:21.582
(whispers) ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, STAY COOL.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.334
NO DROOL.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.758
JESSE?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.098
(keypad beeps)

17:37.098 --> 17:39.892
<i>(Jesse's voice)</i>
<i>♪ HELLO, IT'S ME ♪</i>

17:39.892 --> 17:41.519
<i>♪ HEL‐‐ ♪</i>

17:41.519 --> 17:43.521
<i>Hey, it's Jesse.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

17:43.521 --> 17:45.565
<i>(beep)</i>

17:49.193 --> 17:50.903
(door closes)

17:50.903 --> 17:53.698
JESSE JUST SENT ME
TO VOICE MAIL.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.700
HE'S AVOIDING ME.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.166
I CANNOT BELIEVE
JESSE BLEW YOU OFF LIKE THAT.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.252
THAT IS SO RUDE!
I KNOW!

18:06.252 --> 18:08.671
AND <i>HE</i> IS THE ONE
WHO KISSED ME,

18:08.671 --> 18:10.673
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.675
I REMEMBER THAT SPECIFICALLY.
THAT WAS NOT IN MY HEAD.

18:12.675 --> 18:15.219
I KNOW, AND IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU CALLED HIM 20 TIMES TODAY

18:15.219 --> 18:17.722
OR CLIMBED UP HIS FIRE ESCAPE
TO LOOK IN HIS WINDOW

18:17.722 --> 18:20.099
OR TAPPED HIS PHONES
OR SENT HIM FLOWERS.
(gasps) FLOWERS!

18:20.099 --> 18:22.018
NO, BETTY,
YOU DID <i>NOT</i> SEND HIM FLOWERS.

18:22.018 --> 18:25.646
THAT IS A ROOKIE MISTAKE.
NO, NO, I PROMISED DANIEL
I WOULD SEND FLOWERS,

18:25.646 --> 18:28.691
AND I TOTALLY FORGOT. IT'S TOO
LATE TO GET 'EM DELIVERED.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.694
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE 'EM MYSELF.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. BYE!

18:35.072 --> 18:37.491
UH, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.493
(sighs)

18:39.493 --> 18:42.038
<i>THAT</i> IS MOLLY'S BUILDING.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.832
I WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN GET
A LOOK AT THIS GUY.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.877
CONNOR, THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU'RE SPYING ON YOUR EX?

18:47.877 --> 18:50.129
I NEED TO KNOW
WHO THIS BASTARD IS.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.131
OKAY, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.342
BUT IF MOLLY'S MOVED ON,
WHAT CAN YOU DO?
(chuckles)

18:54.342 --> 18:56.052
(sighs)

18:56.052 --> 18:58.220
LOOK, MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
SEEING SOMEONE.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.848
I COULD SET YOU UP
WITH SOME GREAT WOMEN.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.017
(chuckles)

19:03.017 --> 19:06.604
OR MAYBE
YOU'RE SEEING SOMEONE?

19:08.147 --> 19:11.067
ACTUALLY, YES.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.652
WILHELMINA.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.237
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU EARLIER.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.531
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO COMPLICATE THINGS AT WORK.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.533
NO, NO, NO, I MEAN,
THAT'S GREAT.

19:19.533 --> 19:23.245
IT MEANS, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE‐‐YOU'RE MOVING ON.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.456
BUT WHAT DOES WILHELMINA
THINK ABOUT ALL THIS?

19:25.456 --> 19:28.417
OH, GOD. SHE DOESN'T KNOW.
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.544
(sighs) WHAT AN IDIOT.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.546
I KNOW.
PARKED UNDER A STREETLIGHT,

19:32.546 --> 19:35.174
COMPLETELY EXPOSED,
UNTINTED WINDOWS...

19:35.174 --> 19:37.176
AMATEURS.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.845
NOT THAT. HE GAVE UP
A ROMANTIC EVENING WITH ME

19:39.845 --> 19:41.847
TO TRADE PUNCHES
WITH DANNY MEADE

19:41.847 --> 19:43.849
AND HANG OUT
IN A PARKED CAR?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.226
IF IT'S ANY COMFORT,

19:45.226 --> 19:48.229
YOU AND CONNOR DO SHARE
A LOVE OF FINE DINING,

19:48.229 --> 19:51.107
CAPITALISM AND COVERT,
LATE‐NIGHT SURVEILLANCES.

19:51.107 --> 19:54.902
YES, YES, YES, YES,
BUT WHO ARE THEY WAITING FOR?

19:54.902 --> 19:57.154
HI, UH, JESSE,
UM, IT'S BETTY.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.156
BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT

19:59.156 --> 20:01.158
BECAUSE YOU JUST SCREENED
THIS CALL

20:01.158 --> 20:03.077
AND YOU'RE AVOIDING ME,

20:03.077 --> 20:06.122
WHICH IS COOL,
'CAUSE I DON'T CARE.

20:08.499 --> 20:11.752
WHAT'S BLACK AND WHITE
AND BROWN ALL UNDER?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.088
BETTY?

20:14.088 --> 20:16.215
(yawns) OH, BOY.
IT'S GETTING LATE.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.967
GETTIN' PRETTY TIRED.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.178
COFFEE?
NO, NO, I'M‐‐I'M‐‐
I'M‐‐I'M OKAY.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.389
(sighs)

20:25.433 --> 20:28.436
YOU KNOW WHAT? UH, ACTUALLY,
I COULD USE THAT COFFEE.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.480
THERE'S GOTTA BE A PLACE
DOWN AT THE END OF THE BLOCK.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.150
SURE, YEAH.
BLACK, CREAM, SUGAR?
THAT'S PERFECT. EVERYTHING.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.193
GREAT. YEAH. THANKS!

20:37.903 --> 20:39.071
(door closes)

20:46.120 --> 20:49.165
(Daniel) BETTY.
OH, DANIEL, HEY, I FORGOT
TO SEND THE FLOWERS,

20:49.165 --> 20:51.500
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST
BRING THEM OVER.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.378
SORRY, I DIDN'T‐‐
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT
OF HERE.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.381
WHAT? WHY?
WELL, WE'RE STALKING MOLLY.
WELL, I'M NOT. CONNOR IS.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.091
I'M JUST KINDA HELPING HIM.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.510
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT REALLY
HELPING HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:01.510 --> 21:03.011
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
TOO COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.513
WHY WOULD YOU BE
STALKING MOLLY?

21:04.513 --> 21:07.099
LOOK, THIS‐‐YOU GOTTA TRUST ME.
THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.477
YOU JUST GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
PLEASE GO, NOW.
OKAY.

21:09.477 --> 21:13.063
RUN. NO, NO, NO, NOT THAT WAY,
THE OTHER WAY. COME ON.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.483
(metal clangs)

21:19.403 --> 21:22.448
DANIEL!
THEY WERE ALL CLOSED.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.075
FLOWERS?
UH, YEAH, WELL, UM,

21:25.075 --> 21:27.703
THE DELIVERY BOY
TRIED TO DROP 'EM OFF

21:27.703 --> 21:30.664
AT MOLLY'S APARTMENT,
SO I STOPPED HIM AND‐‐
WELL, WHO ARE THEY FROM?

21:30.664 --> 21:32.958
NO, NO, DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T TORTURE YOURSELF, CONNOR.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.835
HEY, HEY.
CON‐‐

21:34.835 --> 21:37.630
(sighs)

21:37.630 --> 21:40.132
"TO MOLLY, FROM R. J."

21:40.132 --> 21:43.928
R.J. WHO'S R. J.?
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.388
AND WHAT KIND OF A JERK
SENDS CRAPPY CARNATIONS?

21:46.388 --> 21:50.100
YEAH! WELL, I MEAN,
CARNATIONS AREN'T... THAT BAD.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.561
WHERE DID
THAT DELIVERY BOY GO?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.230
(sighs) CONNOR, HE'S GONE.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.190
LOOK,
YOU'RE WITH WILHELMINA NOW,

21:56.190 --> 21:58.192
AND YOU'RE HAPPY, RIGHT?
YEAH.

21:58.192 --> 22:01.695
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WELL, I HAVE TO KNOW.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.824
NO, NO, NO. IF WILHELMINA
FOUND OUT WHAT YOU WERE DOING,

22:04.824 --> 22:07.535
HOW WOULD THIS MAKE HER FEEL?

22:07.535 --> 22:09.161
COME ON, LOOK.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.706
BUDDY, WHY ARE YOU RISKING
YOUR FUTURE ON THE PAST?

22:12.706 --> 22:14.083
HUH?

22:14.083 --> 22:16.085
(sighs)

22:16.085 --> 22:18.295
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.130
I DON'T KNOW.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.592
LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT, HUH?

22:32.810 --> 22:34.395
(engine turns over)

22:34.395 --> 22:37.314
OOH, LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE LEAVING.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.525
NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.736
(engine turns over)

22:48.075 --> 22:50.369
(Wilhelmina) MOLLY?

22:50.369 --> 22:53.038
THIS IS HER BLOCK.

22:53.038 --> 22:57.001
(sighs) NOW IT ALL MAKES
PERFECT SENSE.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.217
WAIT, SO YOU WERE
ON A STAKEOUT WITH CONNOR

23:05.217 --> 23:09.054
WHO WAS WAITING TO FIND OUT
WHO MOLLY'S NEW BOYFRIEND IS.
YES.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.681
WHO IS YOU.
RIGHT.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.057
OKAY, THAT'S JUST DUMB.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.685
UM, WHY‐‐WHY CAN'T YOU
TELL HIM THE TRUTH?

23:14.685 --> 23:16.687
BECAUSE, BETTY,
IT'S JUST NOT THAT EASY.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.105
WELL, IT'S EASIER THAN LYING

23:18.105 --> 23:20.524
AND ENDING UP
ON A STAKEOUT FOR YOURSELF.
(scoffs)

23:20.524 --> 23:22.902
YOU KNOW, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?
MM.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.904
WHY DO GUYS PLAY GAMES?

23:24.904 --> 23:26.906
I MEAN, WHY ARE THEY
SUCH COWARDS?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.908
WHY ARE THEY SO,
YOU KNOW, BRAVE

23:28.908 --> 23:30.910
WHEN THEY WANT TO KISS YOU
OR SOMETHING,

23:30.910 --> 23:34.121
BUT TRY TO GET 'EM ON THE PHONE
AND ACTUALLY TALK TO YOU,

23:34.121 --> 23:37.750
AND... (scoffs) WELL...
OKAY, UM, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT ME AND CONNOR ANYMORE.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.293
SORRY.

23:39.293 --> 23:43.714
I TRIED TO TALK TO JESSE,
AND HE IGNORED ME‐‐

23:43.714 --> 23:46.175
WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER
HIS DOOR.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.052
BETTY, I'M SORRY.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.846
OH, IT'S JUST GONNA MAKE IT
THAT MUCH HARDER FOR ME

23:50.846 --> 23:52.473
TO LEAVE MY APARTMENT.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.891
WHY?

23:53.891 --> 23:56.185
'CAUSE THERE'S UNFINISHED
BUSINESS BETWEEN US.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.688
BETTY, ARE YOU REALLY SURE
YOU WANT TO MOVE BACK HOME?

23:59.688 --> 24:02.608
OF COURSE. I LOVE MY FAMILY.
NO, NO, I'M NOT SAYING
YOU DON'T.

24:02.608 --> 24:06.195
IT'S JUST THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE
WHEN JESSE KISSES YOU,

24:06.195 --> 24:08.530
YOU CAN'T LEAVE
WHEN HE IGNORES YOU.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.492
MAYBE MOVING BACK TO QUEENS IS
HARDER THAN YOU'RE ADMITTING?

24:11.492 --> 24:15.913
WELL, I GUESS I‐‐

24:15.913 --> 24:18.540
I HAD THIS STUPID FANTASY...

24:18.540 --> 24:22.252
ABOUT BEING IN LOVE
IN THE CITY AND...

24:22.252 --> 24:25.005
BEING THAT GIRL
WHO HANGS OUT IN CAFéS

24:25.005 --> 24:27.841
AND HAS A CUTE BOYFRIEND
AND HOLDS HIS HAND

24:27.841 --> 24:30.552
AND JUST KISSES HIM
RIGHT THERE AND THEN AND...

24:30.552 --> 24:32.763
AND JESSE WAS THE GUY.

24:32.763 --> 24:35.516
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT WHEN HE KISSED ME

24:35.516 --> 24:37.977
THAT MAYBE IT WOULD HAPPEN.

24:37.977 --> 24:41.021
LOOK, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
GET THAT FANTASY WITH JESSE,

24:41.021 --> 24:44.024
BUT AT THE VERY LEAST,
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM

24:44.024 --> 24:46.944
THAT NOBODY TREATS
BETTY SUAREZ LIKE THAT.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.363
THAT'S HOW
YOU CLOSE THE DOOR.

24:49.363 --> 24:52.574
HOW?
HE WON'T ANSWER MY CALLS.

24:52.574 --> 24:56.537
WELL, I SEEM TO RECALL
YOU DID STALK HIM ONCE.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.914
GO FIND HIM.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.049
(knock on door)

25:09.049 --> 25:10.509
HELLO.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.720
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

25:14.763 --> 25:18.267
LOOK, UH, I KNOW YOU'RE STILL
HUNG UP ON MOLLY.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.269
DON'T BOTHER DENYING IT.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.024
I LEARNT THAT MOLLY
IS SEEING SOMEONE,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.651
AND, YES, IT BOTHERED ME.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.695
BUT I'VE MOVED ON.
HAVE YOU?

25:29.695 --> 25:32.698
IT'S OVER.
YOU CAN SAY THAT.
YOU MIGHT EVEN BELIEVE IT.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.034
BUT DEEP DOWN, I KNOW
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.077

SECOND FIDDLE TO ANYONE.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.947

YOU'RE NOT.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.866
THAT'S HALF THE AMOUNT
I USED TO USE.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.285
THAT'S STILL HALF TOO MUCH.

YOUR SPANISH OMELET.
ALL RIGHT.

NO SALT, NO YOLK.

I SET THE RULES.
