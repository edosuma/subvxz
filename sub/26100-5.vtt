into a fight with her sister
before the crash,

22:49.106 --> 22:51.370
and there is nothing
we can do to change that.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.762
- The God account
wouldn't have sent you a name

22:52.806 --> 22:54.111
unless there was
a way to help.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.765
- She has a point.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.985
- Yeah, but the God account
went away, remember?

22:58.028 --> 22:59.160
- Yeah, but she didn't.

22:59.203 --> 23:01.641
- She doesn't remember
the crash.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.686
- I told her that if she talked
to Jack Campbell,

23:03.730 --> 23:05.427
the guy that pulled
her from the car that night,

23:05.471 --> 23:07.124
maybe he could tell her
something

23:07.168 --> 23:08.387
that would give her closure.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.997
- Okay, so let's
go talk to him.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.216
- Even if we wanted to,
how are we going to find him?

23:12.260 --> 23:14.523
- Easy, I looked him up.

23:14.567 --> 23:17.178
Look, Jack was homeless
when he saved Rachel.

23:17.221 --> 23:18.875
The community
rallied around him,

23:18.919 --> 23:20.486
he was able
to turn his life around.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.662
Even got a new job at
a high school downtown.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.620
Look, you want the God account
to be over,

23:24.664 --> 23:26.753
and it is, I get it.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.450
Why not put it to bed?

23:28.494 --> 23:31.497
Look, no regrets.
No questions.

23:31.540 --> 23:35.065
Let's just see it through
to the end one last time.

23:38.068 --> 23:41.332
Jack Campbell, right?
- I know you?

23:41.376 --> 23:44.727
- Uh, you don't,
but we know you.

23:44.771 --> 23:48.122
You're a hero.
- Hero's a stretch.

23:48.165 --> 23:51.081
- We actually know the woman
who you pulled from the car.

23:51.125 --> 23:53.649
Rachel. She's trying
to move on with her life.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.477
We thought maybe
you could help her do that.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.218
- How's that?

23:57.261 --> 23:59.438
- She doesn't remember anything
from the accident.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.309
So I thought
you can talk to her.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.050
You know, walk her through
what happened.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.008
The details might be able
to bring her some closure.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.793
- Yeah, but there's nothing
to walk through.

24:06.836 --> 24:09.535
I was leaving the soup kitchen
and I came across the accident.

24:09.578 --> 24:13.234
It's--it's all in the papers.
- Yeah, I read them.

24:13.277 --> 24:16.585
But you saw Emma
in the car, right?

24:16.629 --> 24:19.370
Was she conscious?
Did she say anything?

24:19.414 --> 24:21.721
- No, no.
She was unconscious, I think.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.157
- You think?

24:23.200 --> 24:26.334
- Yeah, her hair
was covering her face.

24:26.377 --> 24:28.728
- What do you mean?

24:28.771 --> 24:31.252
She was wearing a hat, right?

24:33.384 --> 24:36.126
- I'm done talking
about that night.

24:41.175 --> 24:44.178
- You didn't save Rachel,
did you?

24:44.221 --> 24:47.224
- Look, I've got nothing else
to say about that night.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.575
I just want to move on
with my life, okay?

24:56.233 --> 24:58.758
- Why would he lie
about being a hero?

24:58.801 --> 25:00.760
- I don't know.

25:00.803 --> 25:03.763
But if he didn't pull Rachel
from the car that night,

25:03.806 --> 25:06.113
who did?

25:13.599 --> 25:14.991
[upbeat music]

25:15.035 --> 25:18.778
- So this Jack Campbell guy
didn't save Rachel

25:18.821 --> 25:20.562
but he took credit for it?
- Yeah, I mean, I can see

25:20.606 --> 25:22.433
why a guy in Jack's
position would lie.

25:22.477 --> 25:25.349
From homeless to hero,
there's a lot to lose.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.134
- Yeah, makes sense.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.615
But then why would the person
who saved Rachel vanish

25:29.658 --> 25:31.051
and not take credit for it?

25:31.094 --> 25:32.443
- Maybe they're
hiding something

25:32.487 --> 25:33.662
about what really
happened that night.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.621
[phone chimes]
Here we go.

25:35.664 --> 25:38.101
I just got the police report
from that night.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.755
- How did you get
the police report?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.278
- Well, it's public record,
Rakesh.

25:41.322 --> 25:44.543
Not everything
requires hacking.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.110
Okay, it looks like
the accident happened

25:47.154 --> 25:49.243
just after nine p.m.
up in Harlem.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.593
148th and Bradhurst?

25:51.637 --> 25:53.595
- That's a few blocks
from Dad's church.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.728
- Jack said that he had
just left a soup kitchen

25:55.771 --> 25:57.120
right before
he heard the crash.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.557
I didn't realize it
was the same one

25:58.600 --> 25:59.819
ran by Dad and Uncle T.

25:59.862 --> 26:02.038
- Soup kitchen's open tonight.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.953
Maybe someone else
saw something.

26:03.997 --> 26:06.042
- Wait, so listen to this,
there was a 911 call

26:06.086 --> 26:08.392
from that intersection
at the time of the crash.

26:08.436 --> 26:09.611
Lasted just under a minute.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.221
- Do we know what
the caller said?

26:11.265 --> 26:14.747
- No, they hung up
before they said anything.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.836
Maybe that's
our vanishing hero.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.446
I have a friend
who can run this number,

26:18.489 --> 26:19.665
try and get us a name.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.188
- Okay, I'm going to go down

26:21.231 --> 26:23.538
to the soup kitchen
and see what I could find.

26:26.019 --> 26:29.718
- Miles. This is a surprise.
What brings you down here?

26:29.762 --> 26:31.894
- Well 'cause, you know,

26:31.938 --> 26:34.723
Finer men
love to help people out.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.290
Isn't that right, Miles?

26:36.333 --> 26:38.597
- Actually, I was hoping
to see the sign-in sheets

26:38.640 --> 26:39.989
from a few weeks back.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.643
- And what's this about?

26:41.687 --> 26:43.732
- I've been just looking
into something for a friend.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.691
Name is Rachel Blake.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.215
- And she's come to
the soup kitchen before?

26:48.258 --> 26:50.043
- Not exactly.
- Look, why don't I help him

26:50.086 --> 26:53.307
look through the log-in books,
see if he could find anything.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.526
- I mean, that'll be fine.
- Thanks.

26:58.573 --> 27:01.489
- Yeah, so first her parents
judge me 'cause--

27:01.532 --> 27:03.709
Well, my app failed.
Then everybody freaks out

27:03.752 --> 27:05.624
'cause Rakesh
doesn't have a degree.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.669
Then I find out
that Jaya hid the fact

27:07.713 --> 27:09.453
that she's moving away
for a year.

27:09.497 --> 27:10.977
- Why is she moving?

27:11.020 --> 27:13.762
- She got a fellowship at
the Mayo Clinic.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.939
Yeah.
She's moving to Minnesota.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.462
Paul Bunyan's from there.

27:18.506 --> 27:19.725
What if she, like, discovers

27:19.768 --> 27:21.378
she has a thing
for lumberjacks?

27:21.422 --> 27:24.817
That just--

27:24.860 --> 27:26.906
- Can I make an observation?

27:29.038 --> 27:33.129
Sounds to me like Jaya has
an incredible opportunity,

27:33.173 --> 27:36.132
and you're complaining
how it's going to affect you.

27:36.176 --> 27:39.701
- I'm being totally
self-centered, huh?

27:39.745 --> 27:42.269
And I didn't even tell her
how proud of her I am.

27:42.312 --> 27:45.315
- Rakesh, I know you
don't think you deserve her.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.230
But you do.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.537
I mean, not when
you're acting like this.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.713
In general, I mean.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.455
When does she leave?
- A few days.

27:54.498 --> 27:58.111
- You still have time
to fix this.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.722
Don't let her leave without
her knowing how you feel.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.509
- So the God account
went missing, huh?

28:05.553 --> 28:08.077
- Yeah, and the suggestion
for Rachel Blake.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.862
- But you're
still helping her out,

28:09.905 --> 28:11.385
even though
you don't have to.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.387
- Yeah, I guess so.

28:13.430 --> 28:16.259
Look, Unc, this girl,
she is in a bad place.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.653
- And you're worried about
what happens

28:18.697 --> 28:21.047
if something goes wrong.

28:21.090 --> 28:24.615
If you can't figure out
a way to help her.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.835
- Yeah.
Yeah, I am.

28:26.879 --> 28:29.533
I just need to figure out
all the people that were here

28:29.577 --> 28:30.883
the night Rachel was
pulled from the car

28:30.926 --> 28:32.319
after her accident.

28:32.362 --> 28:33.799
If I can track
these people down,

28:33.842 --> 28:35.278
maybe one of them
might know something.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.977
- Well, I remember
that accident.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.719
It was Jack Campbell
who pulled her out of the car.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.808
- Yeah, I don't want
to call him out,

28:42.851 --> 28:44.940
but I don't think
he did it.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.246
- What do you mean
you don't think he did it?

28:46.289 --> 28:47.769
- I talked to him.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.163
His story doesn't add up.

28:50.206 --> 28:53.166
- Well, I--I don't know
what he told you, but he was

28:53.209 --> 28:56.386
the first person on the scene
when the police arrived.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.954
Now his story has been
an inspiration

28:58.998 --> 29:00.826
to everybody around here.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.566
Actually, he's here tonight.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.307
Your father and I are the ones
that asked him to volunteer

29:04.351 --> 29:06.048
once he got back up
on his feet.

29:06.092 --> 29:08.834
So, I mean, if he's not
the one who pulled the girl

29:08.877 --> 29:11.358
out of the car,
then there's a good chance

29:11.401 --> 29:13.708
that he knows who did.

29:18.060 --> 29:21.716
- You.
You following me now?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.674
- No, this is my dad's church.

- You're Reverend Finer's kid?
- I am.

about saving Rachel.

29:31.552 --> 29:34.163
Her life may still
depend on it.

29:35.295 --> 29:38.341

the paramedics arrived.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.909
So they assumed that

29:40.953 --> 29:43.825
I pulled Rachel from the car
before the explosion.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.740

to mislead anyone.

your uncle stepped in and--

29:51.833 --> 29:53.313

from the car that night?

- I am telling you.

She was drunk and she fell down
and hit her head.

30:30.872 --> 30:34.310

31:41.377 --> 31:43.814

- What?

31:43.858 --> 31:45.860
- I saw Jack
at the soup kitchen.

He admitted to me that
he did not save Rachel.

Rachel crawled out of the car

I don't have any proof.
