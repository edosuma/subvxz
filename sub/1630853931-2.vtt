take you backwards...

28:21.477 --> 28:24.217
- I was diagnosed with
very, very advanced

28:24.250 --> 28:26.989
stage four ovarian cancer
four years ago.

28:28.391 --> 28:31.364
And I underwent
two major surgeries,

28:31.397 --> 28:33.301
18 rounds of chemotherapy.

28:33.335 --> 28:36.341
And I mean, I felt like
I had been poisoned.

28:36.374 --> 28:38.445
So I was taking
all kinds of things

28:38.478 --> 28:40.349
to counteract that.

28:44.825 --> 28:47.329
I really, uh,
credit Dr. Mercola

28:47.363 --> 28:49.100
with saving my life.

28:49.133 --> 28:51.437
I mean, yes, a doctor
that did surgery on me,

28:51.471 --> 28:55.045
an oncologist, also, yes,
helped save my life,

28:55.078 --> 28:57.116
but he's where I started.

28:57.149 --> 29:00.122
And he was the primary source.

29:00.155 --> 29:03.796
And he's kind of, at first,
alls I had to go on.

29:03.829 --> 29:08.539
- Every day, 1,600 people
die from cancer

29:08.572 --> 29:10.342
in the United States alone.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.346
And how do we beat
this disease with lifestyle?

29:12.379 --> 29:13.816
By paying attention

29:13.849 --> 29:15.520
to the types of foods
that you're eating

29:15.553 --> 29:17.222
and when you're eating them.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.395
- When you feel
that your life has been saved

29:20.429 --> 29:23.134
by somebody, you are gonna
be so grateful to that person

29:23.168 --> 29:24.470
and trust that person,

29:24.504 --> 29:26.474
so that the next thing
that they say to you,

29:26.508 --> 29:28.813
you're gonna maybe be
even more inclined to believe,

29:28.846 --> 29:31.484
or at least loyal enough
to listen.

29:31.518 --> 29:33.088

makes it insidious

29:33.121 --> 29:35.827

really dangerous idea appears

29:35.860 --> 29:37.396

of a bunch of other stuff

29:37.429 --> 29:39.501

30:07.624 --> 30:09.995
And so I actually started
getting fearful.

30:10.028 --> 30:13.268

about some protocols

30:13.301 --> 30:15.005

The Truth About COVID-19.

"a conspiracy theory."

39:55.131 --> 39:56.902
It's way for him to say,

He's still on Twitter,

where he's actually making

40:55.084 --> 40:56.955
a substantial amount of money.

as his own website,

41:01.731 --> 41:03.769

41:03.802 --> 41:05.839
As long
as mainstream platforms

are allowing him to operate,

41:08.110 --> 41:10.816
he is seeing slow

41:10.849 --> 41:12.820
And that means

to gain power and influence

41:58.344 --> 42:01.250
Unfortunately,
the currency of that fortune

People's consumption

JAN: If someone says to you,
"Take control of your health,"

42:35.919 --> 42:37.990
it implies that you don't have
control over your health

42:38.023 --> 42:39.727
and it's something
you need to regain.

42:39.761 --> 42:42.600
It implies
you've lost autonomy.

42:42.633 --> 42:45.104
It implies you've lost choice.

42:46.908 --> 42:48.612

I can't explain it.

I don't understand it.

"I will not besmirch
or critique

43:27.355 --> 43:30.161
another physician's
rightful practice."

43:30.963 --> 43:34.804
The term "rightful"
is very important to me.

43:34.837 --> 43:37.342
If you are against science,

43:37.375 --> 43:40.181

43:40.214 --> 43:44.356
I think you've left
the boundaries of rightful.

And that's one of the reasons
why I'm talking.

44:02.358 --> 44:04.964
any issue,
and offer you a solution.

44:04.997 --> 44:07.670
And it only costs you
this much.

44:09.072 --> 44:12.245

44:12.278 --> 44:13.815
This is most of it.
