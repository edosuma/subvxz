00:21.171 --> 00:23.080
Well, there can
only be one queen.

00:23.173 --> 00:24.915
My name is Catt Phoenix,

00:24.933 --> 00:27.601
and my daughter Ana and I have
an appointment with Luke Roman.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.178
I am so sorry. We must
have double-booked y'all.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.755
There are millions of people

00:31.774 --> 00:33.273

to be country singers, Mom.

00:33.425 --> 00:34.608
Yes, but they're not you.

Nick, it's over, all right?
I ended it.

00:43.602 --> 00:45.544
How old is she
this time Clive, hmm?

00:45.695 --> 00:47.938

It's Luke.

Good evening, Ms. Roman.

01:18.821 --> 01:20.579
-Evening.
-I hate to bother you this late.

Oh, he's in bed.

-Really?
-NICKY: Mm-hmm.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.812
I just saw his truck
down near the woods

01:28.905 --> 01:32.073
by Enchanted Rock
about an hour ago.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.741
It's kind of late
for him to be out there.

01:33.836 --> 01:35.836
Yeah, he went for a drive.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.172
Um, he got back
and turned in a while ago.

01:39.325 --> 01:41.517
Do you want me
to go wake him up?

01:43.753 --> 01:46.346
No need. Just wanted
to make sure he got home okay.

01:46.498 --> 01:49.166
All right.
That's sweet. Thank you.

01:49.184 --> 01:52.194

-Good night.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.383

02:17.787 --> 02:19.045
All right, they're gone.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.715
-Not for long.
-What?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.200
In about 40 minutes,

02:23.293 --> 02:24.977
they're either gonna show up
here with a warrant,

02:25.128 --> 02:26.628
or they're gonna go back
out there and start digging.

02:26.722 --> 02:28.221
Right. So what are you saying?

02:28.374 --> 02:31.191

I cannot wait to see her
wipe the floor with Nicky.

04:18.667 --> 04:22.002
Oh! Sister rivalry
is the best rivalry.

04:22.154 --> 04:25.005
Ugh. I hate that everything has

-I love Nicky.
-Well, so do I.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.268

04:29.495 --> 04:31.328
<i> Game of Thrones</i>
with their country music.

04:31.346 --> 04:33.513
When your mama
won her first crown,

04:33.665 --> 04:38.001
she sang circles
around both Reba and Dolly.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.594
I appreciate the support.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.596
I'm gonna go out there
and do my best,

04:41.615 --> 04:44.533
but this is not a competition,
and there is no rivalry.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.620
Her naivete is adorable.

04:48.772 --> 04:49.746
(laughs)

04:56.371 --> 04:58.797
Sorry, Mom. I'm taking mine
to go. Looks delicious, though.

Well, don't forget your meds
and your... and your cleats.

05:02.194 --> 05:03.527
Yeah, I got it. See ya.

05:03.695 --> 05:04.970
And whatever else
you're gonna call me about

05:05.121 --> 05:07.288
-in the next two hours.
-He's 18 now.

05:07.382 --> 05:08.807
You could let him
forget about it.

05:08.958 --> 05:10.142
Maybe then he'd learn.

05:10.293 --> 05:12.719
Well, in that case,
shall I let you...

05:12.813 --> 05:15.555
you forget this?

05:15.707 --> 05:18.132
And here. Sweater.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.559
You've had a cold.
Put it on.

05:19.711 --> 05:21.061
Too bad
the Grammys don't have an award

-Mm.
-CLIVE: Hey.

05:28.645 --> 05:31.312
What about me?
What should I remember?

05:31.332 --> 05:33.314
I'd say
to keep it in your pants,

05:33.334 --> 05:34.666
but I don't think
that's possible.

05:34.818 --> 05:36.001
I meant what I said, Nick.

05:36.228 --> 05:37.819
It's all behind me.

05:37.913 --> 05:39.987
I'm just about
to go to therapy now

05:40.040 --> 05:41.489
so I can deal
with why I'm so compelled

05:41.583 --> 05:43.900
to screw up the best thing
that ever happened to me.

05:43.993 --> 05:46.178

-Luke.

CLIVE:
Don't bother to knock.

05:53.579 --> 05:55.670
Uh, what brings you here
so early?

05:55.764 --> 05:58.648
We need to talk. Now.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.694
You're a bad liar, Nick.

06:02.771 --> 06:04.512
Even worse forger.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.866
This letter?
The one that Mama didn't write?

06:09.428 --> 06:12.037
-What, you gonna deny it?
-Well, I had to do something.

06:12.188 --> 06:14.021
You and Daddy were arguing,

06:14.041 --> 06:15.615
me and Gigi were
at each other's throats.

06:15.767 --> 06:17.934
-I just thought...
-What?

06:18.027 --> 06:19.360
That making up some fairy tale

06:19.380 --> 06:20.787
in Mama's handwriting
was gonna make it all better?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.697
We've all broken a commandment
somewhere along the line.

06:22.866 --> 06:24.124
I'm sure if you dig deep,

06:24.200 --> 06:26.443
you'll be able
to think of something.

06:26.461 --> 06:29.221
Besides, with the Queens
of Country concert coming up,

06:29.372 --> 06:31.539
I just... (sighs)
I don't know.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.483
I just want some peace
in this family.

06:33.485 --> 06:36.395
Well, speaking of,
I'm working something for you.

06:37.547 --> 06:39.973
Open Horizon's gonna come
to your rehearsal today.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.625
They're ready
to offer me my tour?

06:41.627 --> 06:45.795
Hmm. Think of it more
as a... negotiation.

06:45.889 --> 06:47.221
Fine.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.075
Oh, and I also know
that you've been

06:50.226 --> 06:51.317
poking around Mama's death,

06:51.470 --> 06:53.245
like one of us had something
to do with it.

06:53.321 --> 06:55.730
Now you have got
to stop harping on

06:55.749 --> 06:57.457
about these conspiracy theories.

06:58.401 --> 07:00.568
Yeah, I guess you're right.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.237
Just... sometimes

07:03.257 --> 07:06.383

08:25.989 --> 08:27.488
So you're the new Alec Graham.

08:27.508 --> 08:31.993
Not really. I pride myself on
my relationships with talent.

-I think she ate him.

09:16.448 --> 09:19.783

It's just gamesmanship.

She's a professional hard-ass.

09:21.711 --> 09:23.636

23:06.368 --> 23:09.111
I'm sorry. I-I got enough issues
with my son.

23:09.130 --> 23:11.138
I'll let this one be yours.

23:13.968 --> 23:15.643
Thank you.

23:37.141 --> 23:40.251
Look, Mama. I'm the queen,
just like you.

23:41.312 --> 23:44.755
You are nothing like me.
Nothing!

(sighs)
Well, if that's true,

25:55.555 --> 25:58.556
then all this time,
I've been living up to their...

25:58.783 --> 26:02.117
shining, perfect example, and...

26:02.210 --> 26:05.804
Is anyone's marriage
what it's supposed to be?

26:05.956 --> 26:06.981
Mine is.

26:08.050 --> 26:09.641

there's only

My marriage is none
of your business, Nicolette.

27:20.197 --> 27:22.330
Of course it is.
You and Mama set an example

27:22.383 --> 27:24.958
that I've spent half of my
adult life trying to live up to,

27:25.127 --> 27:27.311
so if it's all a lie,
I'd like to know.

27:29.798 --> 27:32.207
I loved your mother.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.152
Unconditionally,
with all my heart.

27:35.379 --> 27:36.612
But?

27:39.066 --> 27:41.049
It was 40 years ago.

27:42.052 --> 27:45.496
It was one night
and a lifetime of regret.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.074
Did Mama know?

27:49.226 --> 27:50.893
The whole damn time.

27:50.953 --> 27:53.912
She told me
right before she died.

27:54.915 --> 27:56.915
I guess she found a way
to forgive me

27:57.067 --> 27:59.751
whether I deserved it or not.

27:59.828 --> 28:01.920
She made a choice,

28:02.072 --> 28:04.223
and it kept our family together.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.352
What choice would she want me
to make?

28:08.503 --> 28:11.605
Did that pasty limey
cheat on you again?

28:16.603 --> 28:18.845
You asked
what Mama would want you to do.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.014
Well, Mama's gone,

Thanks for waiting for me,

Heard you did your mama proud.

Thank you.

So, whatever you're feeling
because of Clive,

he's the messed-up one,
baby, not you.

41:26.726 --> 41:27.967
Thank you.

41:31.564 --> 41:33.064
I'm a bad man, baby.

41:33.216 --> 41:36.551
I mean, I'm the reason
your mama died.

41:36.553 --> 41:38.161
I broke her heart.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.663
No, you didn't.

41:40.890 --> 41:43.833
She was... beautiful and alive,

41:43.985 --> 41:48.079
and then she told me
what she knew, and...

41:48.231 --> 41:51.156
I'm-I'm the one
that deserved to die.

41:51.251 --> 41:53.158
No. That's not why she died.

41:53.253 --> 41:56.346
She died because she was sick.

41:56.573 --> 41:58.163
You are a good man.

41:58.366 --> 42:01.226
And you show that
