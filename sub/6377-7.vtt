02:34.739 --> 02:35.979
Wait a minute.

02:36.157 --> 02:39.274
I thought you were supposed to be
invisible in a mirror.

02:39.452 --> 02:43.695
We started most of the myths
about ourselves many centuries ago.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.531
If humans thought that
we couldn't be seen in a mirror...

02:47.710 --> 02:51.373
...it was another way for us to prove
that we weren't vampires.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.755
And that way, we could stay hid.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.339
So what about holy water?

02:59.638 --> 03:00.798
It's just water.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.089
-Crucifixes?
-Geometry.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.179
-Garlic?
-lt's irritating, but that's pretty much it.

03:11.609 --> 03:15.101
-| feel a little weak.
-Of course you do.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.653
l fed on your blood.

03:17.823 --> 03:21.281
You should take
some vitamin B12 to replenish.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.033
Will I need to do that every day?

03:24.288 --> 03:25.789
If you don't mind, yes.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.948
And no garlic.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.790
Is it always like this?

03:33.964 --> 03:36.091
No, it is not.

03:39.261 --> 03:43.095
I never thought I'd be able to....

03:43.641 --> 03:45.882
I am honored that you chose me.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.805
Her tiny little legs.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.565
Flexible and smooth.

03:56.487 --> 03:57.943
How's the homework coming?

03:58.447 --> 04:01.234
I hate math. Gran usually helps me.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.819
Maybe I can help.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.245
Her skin is perfect.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.160
So soft.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.947
Come sit on my lap so I can see it better.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.504
I'm good at this.

04:24.682 --> 04:27.173
It's easier than you think.

04:28.477 --> 04:32.311
No hair anywhere on her body.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.891
All mine.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.022
Uncle Bartlett loves you, sweetie.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.396
It was just touching.

04:41.991 --> 04:44.653
Wasn't nearly as bad
as what happens to some girls.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.697
-Did you tell anyone?
-Gran.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.447
She ran him off
and never spoke to him again.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.538
-Her own brother.
-It wasn't your fault.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.624
I know that.

04:59.925 --> 05:04.965
But here I am.

05:05.431 --> 05:10.471
Having just had one of the most
important experiences...

05:10.644 --> 05:12.430
...in a girl's life.

05:12.605 --> 05:16.564
And it was...

05:16.817 --> 05:19.058
...so, so perfect.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.526
Great.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.733
I hate that...

05:25.242 --> 05:29.110
...I can't not think about him.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.956
You think about whatever you think about.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.917
It's okay.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.796
You're safe with me.

05:57.107 --> 06:02.147
You motherfuckers
gonna have to be patient.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.148
There's good things coming your way.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.743
Now, this ain't Christmas morning...

06:10.913 --> 06:13.905
...where you're all jacked up on caffeine...

06:14.083 --> 06:20.124
...ripping off that cheap Wal-Mart paper
to get your blender. No.

06:20.965 --> 06:24.958
A whole lot of creativity went into
this packaging and I want you to enjoy--

06:25.970 --> 06:27.050
Motherfucker.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.633
-Back up the truck, man.
-Don't fucking creep, bitch.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.672
You're creeping. What you doing here?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.761
| just need to get some more V.

06:35.187 --> 06:38.304
I need you to run your ass
out of my goddamn doon/vay...

06:38.482 --> 06:39.813
...because I'm working.

06:39.984 --> 06:42.726
Come on, buddy. ljust need a little.

06:43.821 --> 06:46.483
-I told you not to take too much.
-Yeah, I know.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.272
And you wind up in the hospital.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.827
I said, "Keep quiet about
where it came from"...

06:50.995 --> 06:53.452
...and you fucking ran off
at the mouth to Tara.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.079
Then you got vamped up
and fucking threw a cop around.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.956
You can't handle the shit, buddy.

06:58.127 --> 07:00.539
Look, I'll pay however you want.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.833
I'll even show my wiener on your website.

07:04.008 --> 07:07.500
You can take your little stumpy white dick
and get the fuck out my joint.

07:07.678 --> 07:08.793
That's what I want.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.640
And what you gonna do?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.513
You gonna call the law?

07:21.358 --> 07:23.269
-Whoa, fuck.
-What you bringing?

07:23.444 --> 07:25.526
Don't fucking fuck me, motherfucker.
Hear me?

07:25.696 --> 07:27.687
-Okay.
-I will fuck your ass up. You get me?

07:27.865 --> 07:30.106
Yeah, okay. Okay.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.525
Get the fuck up out of here.

07:34.455 --> 07:38.789
-At least tell me where I can find more?
-The morgue. That's where you're going.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.371
Get the fuck out of here.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.464
Bitch.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.052
This is where I spend my days.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.482
Does anyone ever get in there with you?

08:05.611 --> 08:07.476
This is not a place for you.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.235
So we can never sleep beside each other.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.820
No one else knows where I rest.

09:09.591 --> 09:13.425
What does it mean to accept Jesus
as your personal savior?

09:13.595 --> 09:16.928
We'll write a check for the electric
and put it in the water envelope...

09:17.099 --> 09:20.216
...then stick the check for the water bill
in the electric envelope.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.726
They'll think it was a mistake
and call about it...

09:22.896 --> 09:25.148
...and we'll be in the clear
for another month.

09:28.152 --> 09:30.985
I need $445.

09:31.155 --> 09:32.941
No way, Mama. We are broke.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.982
I need it to exorcise the demon
that is living inside of me.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.242
You need to do what normal people do:

09:38.412 --> 09:40.778
Stop drinking and go to AA meetings.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.413
I'm not a group person,
and the demon knows that.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.701
Does the demon know you spike
your coffee? I can smell it from here.

09:46.879 --> 09:50.542
I can't help it. The demon told me
to finish off everything in the house today.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.377
It doesn't want me to get exorcised.

09:52.551 --> 09:56.920
Next time you and your demon have a chat,
you can tell it to go out and get a damn job.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.507
The demon has a job:

09:58.682 --> 10:02.095
Going after people that are weak
but still have faith.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.100
It's a jealous demon.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.978
lt knows how close I am to Jesus.
That's why it picked me.

10:07.149 --> 10:10.186
-Oh, my God.
-Don't you dare take the Lord's name in vain.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.024
Tara, honey.

10:20.996 --> 10:23.908
I know I wasn't the best mother.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.873
I fucked up a lot...

10:27.628 --> 10:29.493
...and I'm sorry.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.962
I wanna do this for the both of us.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.045
That's why I talked her down $50.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.716
Please help me with this.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.635
Please.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.846
Mama.

10:45.854 --> 10:50.143
-Put down that coffee and look at me.
-|t's the demon drinking, not me.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.685
Give me that. Put d--

10:52.027 --> 10:54.860
-Don't spill it!
-Mama.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.078
It's the demon.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.832
It's the demon.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.567
Jason.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.897
What are you doing?

11:38.615 --> 11:40.151
Nothing.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.999
You went ahead and did it, huh?

11:51.169 --> 11:52.625
My own sister.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.162
Nothing but a damn fangbanger.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.797
You saved it all these years
for a fucking vampire?

11:57.968 --> 11:59.549
-Bill is a gentleman.
-He bit you.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.302
He doesn't hit me,
which is more than I can say for you.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.804
I tried to apologize,
but you wouldn't let me.

12:04.975 --> 12:09.093
-What you doing with Gran's candlesticks?
-l'm just taking half of what's mine.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.853
-Her wedding present from her mother.
-I need the money.

12:12.024 --> 12:14.231
For what? You have a job and a house.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.979
Sook, it's none of your business.

12:17.988 --> 12:21.606
Gran might have spoiled you rotten,
but I won't. This is my house now.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.944
You put those things down and get out.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.241
Hey.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.790
You were gonna sell herjewelry?

12:44.222 --> 12:46.258
Hey,dog.

12:48.518 --> 12:53.262
Goddamn son of a bitching
shit-ass fucking trailer.

12:56.193 --> 12:59.936
What are you--? What are you doing
coming in here like you own the place?

13:02.491 --> 13:05.198
Better? Or you want me to call?

13:05.369 --> 13:07.530
Hi, Sam, it's me,
the girl you've been fucking.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.538
Mind if I drop by, interrupt your cussing,
say hi to you and your cute little dog?

13:12.042 --> 13:15.705
Yeah, I do mind. Last time I saw you,
you left me high and dry...

13:15.879 --> 13:17.995
-...in some fleabag motel.
-I had to.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.880
Wasn't the first time.
I don't have time for that bullshit.

13:21.051 --> 13:24.293
Well, maybe I'm not in a hurry
to get something going with my boss.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.134
Then why the hell are you here?
It was your big idea to have sex, not mine.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.220
-Like you didn't want it.
-I hired you after you got fired.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.386
Now you throw being your boss in my face?

13:33.563 --> 13:35.599
Don't treat me like I'm some asshole.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.106
Do you think I'd sleep with you
if I thought that?

13:38.276 --> 13:41.188
l have no idea what you think, Tara,
but tell you what I think.

13:41.363 --> 13:45.026
I think you better give me one good reason
not to throw you out of here now.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.195
I'm no good at this.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.532
Try harder.

13:53.875 --> 13:57.242
Sam, I'm sorry.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.084
I don't know how to be with somebody.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.090
I never--

14:05.220 --> 14:07.085
Maybe I'm "unboyfriendable."

14:10.517 --> 14:12.428
No, I'm just in a shitty mood.

14:12.602 --> 14:15.935
Because of me? I don't want that.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.972
No, it's not you. lt'sjust--

14:19.401 --> 14:21.767
This trailer's falling down around me.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.816
Well, at least you're not
living with your mother.

14:25.574 --> 14:29.112
Hey, do your folks ever ask you for money
for some stupid-ass shit...

14:29.286 --> 14:31.322
...they dreamed up that you think is crazy?

14:31.496 --> 14:33.327
My family's not close.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.204
You're lucky.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.786
You need a Robertson screwdriver.

14:43.592 --> 14:47.301
-How would you know something like that?
-No daddy and a drunk mom.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.591
All the fixing fell to me.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.225
The place would look good with a--
With a little work.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.495
Hello.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.455
Speaking. Who is this?

15:17.459 --> 15:18.494
What?

15:18.668 --> 15:22.752
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Thornton,
but it is against bank policy...

15:22.923 --> 15:25.505
...to extend a loan for an exorcism.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.586
We both know what's going on here.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.093
You won't give me a loan
because you're a bigot.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.255
Many of our clients are African-American.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.674
You saying thatjust proves my point.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.434
I ain't talking about the color of my skin,
butyouis.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.766
Well, now, that is simply not the case.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.809
We have recently accepted a client
who is Vampire-American.

15:44.986 --> 15:48.194
I don't care who you give loans to,
it's not Lettie Mae Thornton.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.528
You are prejudiced against me
because I am a Christian.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.987
What? No, I teach Sunday school.

15:54.162 --> 15:57.700
Then you know what I'm talking about.
The whole world is against us.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.286
They even try and take away Christmas.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.793
This is your chance
to stop that persecution in its tracks.

16:03.964 --> 16:08.048
-Show Jesus you have a charitable nature.
-Well, a bank is not a charity.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.217
Maybe Mr. Gus just don't like women,
is that it?

16:11.388 --> 16:14.801
No, what-- No. I mean, yes, |--

16:14.975 --> 16:16.886
Then let's you and me work something out.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.518
My landlord don't mind
if I get a little behind in my rent.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.021
I think we need to
terminate this conversation.

16:23.191 --> 16:26.683
There may be snow on the mountaintop,
but there's fire in the valley.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.727
What the hell, Mama?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.526
This white devil tried to sexual-harass me.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.737
I'm gonna sue his narrow ass!

16:34.911 --> 16:36.867
-I assure you--
-What are you doing here?

16:37.038 --> 16:41.247
Trying to borrow money. I got a daughter,
want me to live with a demon inside me!

16:41.418 --> 16:44.251
Mama, there is no demon.
You just have an addiction.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.831
I can feel it in me right now.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.497
Nobody believes me!

16:49.634 --> 16:53.252
I do not want to live like this no more.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.616
I gotta go lay down.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.399
That demon's gnawing at me
something awful.

17:16.578 --> 17:19.069
You need to drink some water.

18:13.718 --> 18:17.336
-Paying you to cook, not beat on customers.
-I want a motherfucking raise.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.426
I'll think about it. Till then, no trouble.
We're getting busy.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.181
Tara called. She ain't coming in.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.641
What?

18:24.813 --> 18:26.599
Hell, we're already short a waitress.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.480
Don't worry, Sam. We'll make it work.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.516
Well, goddamn.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.687
Look at you. All pornolicious.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.355
What kind of crazy mix you gone
and got yourself into?

18:37.534 --> 18:40.446
Can't I just be in a good mood
without it being a big deal?

18:40.620 --> 18:44.363
It's a pretty night outside and
I'm glad to be enjoying it with my friends.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.377
-Yeah.
-Hey.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.163
It's me.

18:53.341 --> 18:54.877
Hey. Who's "me"?

18:55.677 --> 18:57.633
Randi Sue.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.795
Like you don't know.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.801
Oh, hey. Hey.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.887
-How's it going?
-Well, I'm at Merlotte's.

19:05.061 --> 19:09.555
And I'm just waiting for you to
come on down and buy me a drink.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.896
Oh, well, I ain't coming
to Merlotte's tonight.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.901
You ain't avoiding me, are you?

19:16.072 --> 19:20.736
Because that shit's not gonna fly, cowboy.
Not after the other night.

19:20.910 --> 19:24.744
No, of course not. It's just that
I'm going into Shreveport tonight, that's all.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.529
Can I come?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.490
Sure.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.252
l was thinking about going to that
vampire bar. You know where it's at?

19:34.424 --> 19:35.834
Hello ?

19:36.301 --> 19:39.919
I may not know much, but I do know
better than to associate myself...

19:40.096 --> 19:42.758
-...with people of low moral character.
-Well, okay.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.719
I hope you enjoy spending eternity in hell.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.010
Asshole!

20:05.246 --> 20:08.534
Terry, can you run that
to them crackers, please?

20:08.708 --> 20:11.620
-Sure thing.
-Thank you so much.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.877
Don't you look nice tonight.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.585
-I love how you did your hair.
-Well, thank you.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.585
Honey, that scarf is double cute.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.100
There's something different about you.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.974
You need to tell me what is going on.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.601
Is it a man?

20:30.772 --> 20:34.105
I'm not really comfortable
discussing my personal business...

20:34.275 --> 20:35.401
...especially not here.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.275
Well, everyone else's personal life
is open to you.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.316
I forgive you, I know you can't help that...

20:41.491 --> 20:46.281
...but it does make being your friend
kind of lopsided.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.164
Please tell me it was Sam, not that vampire.

20:52.335 --> 20:56.669
Yes, it was Bill.
And I think I might be in love with him.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.671
Don't tell anybody, okay?

20:59.634 --> 21:01.135
Goddamn it.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.838
Fuck!

21:03.513 --> 21:04.923
Sook, order up.

21:08.184 --> 21:11.347
Sookie has been with that vampire.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.681
-That's just bar talk.
-She told me so herself.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.441
Oh, my Lord. Suppose she gets pregnant.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.193
How in the world can she
nurse a baby with fangs?

21:21.364 --> 21:24.982
You just be her friend.
She need one now more than ever.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.529
There you go.
You're gonna love that okra special.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.446
It's so fresh, it'll hop right off your plate.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.000
Don't go anywhere.
I need two more pitchers of Bud.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.204
Keep your hands to yourself, Sam Merlotte.

21:35.378 --> 21:39.041
-You have no right to touch me.
-You're a damn fool, you know that?

21:41.384 --> 21:44.171
What I do on my own time
is no concern of yours...

21:44.345 --> 21:45.551
...or any of y'all's.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.587
Yes, I had sex with Bill.

21:47.765 --> 21:51.007
And since every one of y'all's
too chicken to ask, it was great.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.302
I enjoyed every second of it.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.392
And if you don't like that,
you can just fire me.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.229
I'm gonna bite you.
I'm really gonna bite you.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.693
That's what I want, Daddy.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.615
Hey.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.999
Your mama know you're out in the big city?

22:17.170 --> 22:19.832
-My mama's dead.
-So am |.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.586
Let me see some lD.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.384
Jason Stackhouse from Bon Temps?

22:35.104 --> 22:36.935
You related to Sookie by any chance?

22:37.106 --> 22:40.894
Yeah, she's my sister.
How do you know her?

22:42.445 --> 22:44.356
She stands out. Do you?

22:46.658 --> 22:49.445
Maybe. In other ways.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.953
Why are you here?

22:54.123 --> 22:56.330
Well, you know, I heard it was cool.

22:56.501 --> 22:59.538
Wanted to check it out, see what's up.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.579
I'm one of those open-minded kind of guys.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.793
Yeah.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.639
Tell me why you came here.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.978
I want some vampire blood.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.940
What time do you get off work?

23:23.987 --> 23:26.603
You came for my blood?

23:26.781 --> 23:29.989
Well, yeah, you're right.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.616
You're nothing like your sister.

23:36.666 --> 23:37.997
Go on in.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.008
And good luck getting out.

24:19.876 --> 24:22.037
I don't keep cash in the house.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.702
Oh, I'm not here for money.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.713
I'm here for Sookie.

24:30.595 --> 24:34.053
-Damn, I'm getting eaten alive out here.
-You wanna meet the devil...

24:34.223 --> 24:36.509
-...wait at the crossroad.
-That was a mile back.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.845
ForJeaneﬂe,
you go past where the devil's at.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.386
That is the biggest load of bullshit
I ever heard.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.055
You're getting as bad off
as Lafayette and his juju.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.896
My poor sister.
I pity having to raise a sexual deviant.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.357
That runs in families.
You know, like demons.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.396
You showed up.

24:52.575 --> 24:55.032
I figured that demon of yours
wouldn't let you.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.074
You must be Tara.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.496
l'm Miss Jeanette.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.795
You ready?

25:04.962 --> 25:07.749
Fully prepared, body and soul,
for this exorcism?

25:07.924 --> 25:10.006
I didn't eat anything all day, like you said.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.837
Have you made your peace?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.797
Is it gonna hurt?

25:14.514 --> 25:16.254
Of course it's gonna hurt.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.013
It's like childbirth...

25:18.184 --> 25:20.766
...except the demon don't wanna come out.

25:20.937 --> 25:23.895
And it ain't your body
that could get ripped up...

25:24.065 --> 25:25.271
...it's your soul.

25:27.360 --> 25:32.445
ln olden days, folks paid my grandmama
using tobacco and livestock.

25:32.615 --> 25:34.606
But today it's cash.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.953
In advance.

25:48.965 --> 25:52.628
That demon will not inhabit you
after tonight.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.797
Let's get this shit over with.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.504
Lettie Mae,
you're gonna need to undress now.

26:43.144 --> 26:48.684
It felt like-- It felt like every single care
or worry or sadness I ever had...

26:48.858 --> 26:52.021
...was just flowing out of me into him.

26:52.195 --> 26:55.107
And, yeah, that hurt at first.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.613
But then when l relaxed, it didn't hurt at all.

26:59.869 --> 27:03.202
l was always too scared
to let them bite me.

27:03.372 --> 27:07.615
I don't know, Sook. ljust think that
when there's blood involved...

27:07.794 --> 27:09.000
...a line been crossed.

27:09.170 --> 27:13.038
Oh, I definitely crossed a line,
but I'm glad I did.

27:13.216 --> 27:17.255
Well, you go ahead on, hooking
with your bad ass. Good for you.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.465
It ain't possible to live
unless you crossing somebody's line.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.225
Skank.

27:38.366 --> 27:39.481
Excuse me.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.693
May I take a picture of you?

27:46.415 --> 27:48.155
You may.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.954
No pictures.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.043
-He said I could take it.
-I did not say you could keep it.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.219
Wicked dancer.

28:10.398 --> 28:12.354
Can I get you another?

28:13.484 --> 28:17.022
No. But I will have something stronger.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.690
Not Tru Blood, but really strong.
You know what I'm saying?

28:22.869 --> 28:24.860
We got Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.779
Hundred proof.
lt'll burn the lining right off your stomach.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.572
Something stronger than that.

28:29.959 --> 28:33.326
-A different color.
-Just tell me what the fuck you want, boy.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.836
Something closer to the color
of the walls in here.

28:36.007 --> 28:38.919
-You know. Let go of me.
-There you are. Come sit with me.

28:39.093 --> 28:40.799
-Why don't you hold on?
-Sit with me.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.679
-I know what you're looking for. Come on.
-Goddamn.

28:44.849 --> 28:47.261
-|t's hotter than hell in here.
-No, it's an icebox.

28:47.435 --> 28:50.302
-You're sweating for another reason.
-Yeah, I could use some V.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.437
Hey, V8.
No, I don't think that they serve that here.

28:53.608 --> 28:55.974
-Why the fuck would I want V8?
-Shut up.

28:56.152 --> 29:00.896
Listen, they can hear really well, all right?
So let's talk about it later.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.985
Come on, let's get out of here
before you get us both killed.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.742
I ain't going nowhere
until I get what I came for.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.323
Hey.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.994
Let's do it.

29:13.836 --> 29:16.327
What kind of stupid bitch
would do something like that?

29:16.505 --> 29:18.837
Something like what, Royce?

29:19.342 --> 29:22.004
-Fuck a vampire.
-Fuck a vampire?

29:22.470 --> 29:25.007
Hell, no. I like my meat alive.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.767
Well, hey there, sugar.

29:54.543 --> 29:58.377
-Get us three Tru Bloods.
-Y'al| need to go somewhere else.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.959
This is a family place. Locals only.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.465
Well, we just closed
on a place up the road...

30:03.636 --> 30:06.548
...so that makes us official citizens
of Renard Parish.

30:07.181 --> 30:10.389
-We're the new locals.
-My place, my rules.

30:10.559 --> 30:16.020
Discrimination against vampires is punishable
by law in the great state of Louisiana.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.397
Personally, I don't give a fuck...

30:18.567 --> 30:21.354
...but I am thirsty.

30:21.529 --> 30:25.238
You are not welcome here.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.825
That shit only works in a private home.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.697
How nice to see you again, Sookie.

30:36.085 --> 30:38.167
You are looking delectable as always.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.293
-You know them?
-We've met.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.250
Well, well.

30:42.425 --> 30:45.383
It looks like Little Miss Holdout
has given up the goods.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.092
Brava.

30:47.763 --> 30:51.096
-Did he leave enough for the rest of us?
-I am his.

30:51.559 --> 30:55.051
Well, he is not here, is he?

30:55.771 --> 31:00.390
And while Bill's away,
Malcolm will always play.

31:08.325 --> 31:11.533
Don't you think for one second
I'd ever have anything to do with you.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.867
You were trash while you were alive
and now you're just dead trash.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.953
I'm gonna drain you so slowly,
you're gonna beg me to kill you.

31:18.127 --> 31:19.537
Jihad this, motherfucker!

31:27.053 --> 31:29.294
-You are a dead man.
-Maybe.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.588
-But I'm gonna take one of y'all with me.
-Sam!

31:36.520 --> 31:39.762
I'm gonna reach down your throat
and yank you inside out by your dick.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.225
Please leave him alone.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.312
Stop this.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.144
Now.

31:49.575 --> 31:50.940
You're here for me, not them.

31:51.118 --> 31:54.576
Well, we had to get your attention,
and I do believe it worked.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.080
What do you want?

31:59.543 --> 32:02.000
You never called me back.

32:02.171 --> 32:06.335
Now, if I remembered what feelings were,
mine might be hurt.

32:08.010 --> 32:09.671
Join our nest, Bill.

32:11.806 --> 32:14.843
-Forget these blood-sacks.
-Yeah.

32:15.017 --> 32:18.009
Mainstreaming's for pussies.

32:18.187 --> 32:20.348
Let's party like we used to, huh?

32:21.816 --> 32:24.979
We used to have so much fun.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.603
All right.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.827
-Let's go.
-What the hell are you doing?

32:33.994 --> 32:36.406
-I should be with my own.
-But you're not like them.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.162
You're better than they'll ever be.

32:40.835 --> 32:43.292
I am not human, Sookie.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.872
I am vampire.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.521
Well, that ain't right,
him coming in here like that.

33:08.696 --> 33:10.982
It ain't right them things even exist.

33:23.544 --> 33:27.207
-Let's take the V and go to a roadhouse.
-Not so fast, dude.

33:27.381 --> 33:30.919
The setting is crucial.
You know, just breathe deep.

33:31.093 --> 33:34.836
Think about something that you like.
Sunrise on the gulf.

33:35.431 --> 33:40.551
-I never get up that early.
-Well, something beautiful, then.

33:40.728 --> 33:44.937
You know, whatever you think
is relaxing and nice.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.268
How about you?

33:50.029 --> 33:53.567
l'm Amy Burley. Pleased to meet you.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.564
Jason Stackhouse.

33:55.743 --> 33:59.361
-Where you from?
-Storrs, Connecticut, originally.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.779
I knew that you'd drive a truck. I knew it.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.869
-I bet you work outside too, huh?
-Maybe.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.706
Or maybe I run a store at the mall.

34:09.465 --> 34:12.207
No, really, I'm a doctor.

34:12.593 --> 34:15.050
-What's your specialty?
-Legs.

34:15.221 --> 34:19.089
-l'm a leg doctor.
-Well, doc, I love this truck.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.597
I do. It's authentic.

34:20.768 --> 34:24.636
You know, it's how a truck should be.
None of that stupid extended-cab...

34:24.813 --> 34:27.225
...four-wheel-drive,
just-to-go-to-the-mall crap.

34:27.858 --> 34:29.359
Yeah.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.975
How much V you got?

34:32.363 --> 34:33.478
How far to your place?

34:34.490 --> 34:36.026
Get in.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.696
Where'd you learn how to do this?

34:43.874 --> 34:46.331
I learned from my mama.

34:46.502 --> 34:53.169
And she learned from hers and so on,
going back 1000 years.

34:54.885 --> 34:57.752
Now we're gonna lure this demon out
and then--

34:57.930 --> 34:59.340
Lure it out?

34:59.515 --> 35:01.756
With a bunch of rocks?

35:02.393 --> 35:04.509
Don't you need a Ouija board
and chicken bones?

35:04.687 --> 35:06.018
-Shut up.
-|t's my money.

35:06.188 --> 35:07.348
-But it's my demon.
-Look.

35:10.818 --> 35:13.355
I know you love your daughter.

35:14.571 --> 35:19.782
And I know you love your mama
or else you wouldn't be here.

35:20.577 --> 35:25.697
But this is a serious situation for all of us.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.957
Demons can kill.

35:29.712 --> 35:32.078
And this one will, given half a chance.

35:32.256 --> 35:35.373
-Oh, hell.
-Y'al| need to calm down.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.885
A sacred crone stone.

35:48.063 --> 35:51.055
It's been in my family since Africa.

35:51.233 --> 35:55.021
My generation was 12 kids.

35:55.195 --> 35:57.857
But the stone chose me.

36:05.289 --> 36:07.621
Hell, no.
You ain't putting that thing on my mama.

36:07.791 --> 36:12.410
As soon as that demon leaves your mother,
it'll be looking for a new place to stay.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.544
Come on. We all gonna have to be still.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.918
Don't even breathe.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.887
Let it find the possum.

36:44.620 --> 36:48.533
Sing a crone-stone song.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.700
Sing what land made me.

36:52.878 --> 36:56.917
Dream tinker is my drum.

36:57.091 --> 37:01.460
I hold the power of the stone...

37:01.637 --> 37:03.093
...the water...

37:03.263 --> 37:04.594
...the leaf...

37:04.765 --> 37:06.221
...the dirt.

37:06.392 --> 37:10.305
Stone, water, leaf, dirt.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.227
Sing a demon song.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.018
Think the night made you.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.479
Dark and wet.

37:18.654 --> 37:21.236
Hungry and cold.

37:21.407 --> 37:26.151
Trapped in darkness forever,
lonely for the light.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.485
You are safe here.

37:28.664 --> 37:34.125
Safe and welcome. Safe and welcome.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.335
By the power of the stone...

37:37.506 --> 37:42.091
...I bid you depart
and join the world of light.

38:13.292 --> 38:16.375
l froze up. I let everybody down.
I didn't do nothing.

38:16.545 --> 38:19.412
This ain't Baghdad, Terry.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.714
lt's Merlotte's, okay?

38:23.635 --> 38:26.502
Ain't nothing anybody could've done.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.550
I'm supposed to.

38:34.521 --> 38:37.012
I know where that house they bought is at.

38:37.191 --> 38:40.524
It's about four miles away,
right at the edge of town.

38:40.903 --> 38:42.439
It'd be easy to sneak up on them.

38:42.613 --> 38:44.604
If you think you can
sneak up on a vampire...

38:44.781 --> 38:47.193
...y'all dumber in the head
than a hog is in the butt.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.358
Fucking a vampire
don't make you no expert.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.994
-You're contaminated for normal people.
-What you know about normal people?

38:53.165 --> 38:54.951
I know they don't fuck dead things.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.911
You mess with Bill Compton...

38:57.085 --> 39:00.577
...I promise, you will be a dead thing.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.673
We gotta do something.
These rednecks are getting riled up.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.460
-Talking about going after the vampires.
-Not my problem.

39:08.639 --> 39:10.595
I hope they kill them all.

39:10.807 --> 39:13.298
-Bill is not like them.
-He went with them.

39:13.477 --> 39:16.594
-To get them away.
-Doesn't matter. He belongs with his kind.

39:16.772 --> 39:18.433
Are you listening to yourself?

39:18.607 --> 39:22.099
Look, whatever goes on
between you and him's your business...

39:22.277 --> 39:24.939
...but I do not want him in my bar.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.104
Weren't for that little Stackhouse bitch...

39:27.282 --> 39:30.240
...there wouldn't be no vampires
coming around here at all.

39:30.410 --> 39:33.402
Round them all up at daybreak
and shoot the sunlight into them.

39:33.580 --> 39:36.287
I went to Wellesley.
l was supposed to do prelaw...

39:36.458 --> 39:39.165
...but I said screw it,
and I studied philosophy instead.

39:39.336 --> 39:42.624
And that pissed the parental units off
bigtime...

39:42.798 --> 39:46.461
...as if the meaning of life's just irrelevant,
right?

39:46.635 --> 39:52.096
I got two years at Vo-Tech
studying landscape technology.

39:52.266 --> 39:56.805
Finally, I couldn't take any more of that
artificial lockjaw lifestyle, so hit the road.

39:56.979 --> 39:58.389
Lockjaw? Like rabies?

39:59.439 --> 40:03.899
No, it's talking with your teeth clenched
together so you don't get lines in your face.

40:04.069 --> 40:10.110
"Amy, please tell me you're not having sex
with that disgusting man."

40:10.284 --> 40:13.742
People who talk that way here don't want
anyone to know they got teeth out.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.153
-Where are your CDs?
-They're over there.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.788
-Where's the V at?
-God, I love your place, man.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.826
It's very unselfconscious, so off-the-grid.

40:22.004 --> 40:25.667
It was my parents'. Haven't really done
much with the place since they passed.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.172
That's even better.

40:27.342 --> 40:30.834
I mean, this place goes back to, like,
a more legitimate time, you know...

40:31.013 --> 40:33.345
...before everything got
totally out of whack.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.471
Your parents are part of Gaia.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.179
You know what Gaia is, right?
Theory of Gaia?

40:38.353 --> 40:39.854
Yeah.

40:41.690 --> 40:44.602
The Earth is a living organism.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.358
-Makes weather, which is good for us.
-Right.

40:47.529 --> 40:51.021
Plants give us the chemicals we need.
Everything is connected.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.860
But you know that.

40:53.327 --> 40:56.990
Yeah. I don't like how they keep
taking stuff away.

40:57.164 --> 41:01.157
Like, Pluto's not a planet anymore and
a brontosaurus stopped being a dinosaur.

41:01.335 --> 41:04.953
You just can't say something's
stopped being what it's always been.

41:05.631 --> 41:08.839
-Do you live by yourself?
-Yeah.

41:09.843 --> 41:13.131
-Come on, let's do the V.
-Slow down, baby.

41:14.014 --> 41:16.505
-Do you even know how this stuff works?
-No.

41:16.683 --> 41:20.096
Okay, so blood,
it carries oxygen to our organs, right?

41:20.270 --> 41:23.353
And that's what makes them function.
So it keeps us going.

41:23.523 --> 41:26.560
-|t's like gas in a car engine.
-Okay.

41:26.735 --> 41:29.272
Vampires, they don't need oxygen.

41:29.446 --> 41:32.563
Everything just runs directly off the blood.

41:32.741 --> 41:35.778
Like those cars that run on corn.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.111
I've had this blood for, like, forever...

41:39.289 --> 41:43.328
...so we're gonna need to take some steps
to keep it from coagulating.

41:43.502 --> 41:45.584
Coagulating.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.791
Aspirin. Thins it.

41:48.965 --> 41:53.299
We'll get the full effect
faster and more intense.

42:01.603 --> 42:06.768
You just know, this is what
Holy Communion is symbolic of.

42:06.942 --> 42:09.274
This is the real deal here.

42:09.444 --> 42:13.437
None of that lame-ass empty ritual.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.110
This is nature's greatest gift.

42:22.624 --> 42:25.787
-I thought they'd get all mushy.
-No, see, the V adapts.

42:25.961 --> 42:28.247
It wants to be in us.

42:48.734 --> 42:53.273
We honor Gala and
seek the deepest relationship to her.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.321
Oh, yeah. Me too.

43:00.495 --> 43:05.455
And Pluto can start being a planet again,
connected to stuff.

43:06.835 --> 43:12.296
By taking the blood of the night into our
bodies, we water the flowers of our souls.

43:13.759 --> 43:15.590
Nothing is real.

43:15.761 --> 43:17.968
Everything is permitted.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.147
Damn it, Bill.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.112
Please pick up.

44:23.537 --> 44:24.572
Bill Compton.

44:24.746 --> 44:29.661
To leave a voice message,
press one or just wait for the tone.

44:29.835 --> 44:31.746
Bill, this is the third time I've called.

44:31.920 --> 44:35.128
A lynch mob is going after those vampires.
You gotta get out of there.

44:35.298 --> 44:37.584
-Call me back now.
-When you ﬁnish recording...

44:37.759 --> 44:41.251
...you may hang up
or press pound for more options.

46:00.967 --> 46:03.003
I know, right.

46:11.269 --> 46:15.478
I can't believe I spent $400
to watch you drown a damn possum.

46:15.649 --> 46:17.685
Better not have done anything bad
to my mama.

46:17.859 --> 46:20.191
Is my demon gone forever?

46:20.362 --> 46:21.647
That one is.

46:22.030 --> 46:24.612
-I got another one?
-No.

46:24.783 --> 46:27.195
You belong to yourself now.

46:27.369 --> 46:29.781
But we have to do something
about your daughter.

46:29.955 --> 46:31.661
You ain't gonna do nothing for me.

46:31.831 --> 46:36.200
Your demon isn't the same kind
as your mother's...

46:36.378 --> 46:38.039
...but it's definitely living in you.

46:38.213 --> 46:40.374
Now you think I got
a motherfucking demon?

46:40.548 --> 46:45.133
-Bitch, you as fucked up as your bus.
-That's that demon talking right now.

46:45.929 --> 46:50.172
-And deep down inside, you know it's true.
-No, I do not.

46:51.142 --> 46:54.054
-I can help you.
-I don't want help.

46:54.229 --> 46:57.187
I don't need it,
and I sure as hell can't afford it.

46:59.567 --> 47:01.819
Do you have many friends?

47:04.489 --> 47:06.901
Do you have trouble keeping a job?

47:08.827 --> 47:10.863
You have your own place?

47:12.497 --> 47:14.613
You have a boyfriend?

47:16.251 --> 47:18.913
How long have you ever been
with the same man?

47:27.595 --> 47:29.927
Find me when you're ready.

47:31.516 --> 47:33.802
Let's go. Come on, Mama.

47:34.936 --> 47:36.437
Bill?

47:40.233 --> 47:41.598
Bill?

48:49.803 --> 48:52.169
-What are you doing?
-Turning this shit into napalm.

48:52.347 --> 48:53.678
I ain't taking no chances.

48:55.308 --> 48:56.343
All right, boys.

48:56.518 --> 48:58.429
I'm gonna take the front porch.

48:58.603 --> 49:01.640
-You boys go around to the back windows.
-Which windows?

49:01.815 --> 49:04.306
-Don't matter, fucktard.
-Hey, you fucking spilled it.

49:04.484 --> 49:06.020
Hey, hey.

49:06.653 --> 49:08.609
You wait till you hear me break the glass.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.441
All right?

49:22.293 --> 49:24.375
Go, go.

49:29.384 --> 49:31.090
Hurry up.

49:31.261 --> 49:32.467
Go, go.

49:36.266 --> 49:38.131
-Hey.
-Stop running, dipshit.

50:00.248 --> 50:02.159
Bet you didn't do much fishing in Iraq.

50:02.584 --> 50:05.371
No fish in the sandbox.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.831
No wonder they're so pissed off at us.

50:08.006 --> 50:11.248
We got channel cats
and Shreveport poontang.

50:11.843 --> 50:13.424
I missed this.

50:13.595 --> 50:18.089
Getting up before dawn like when we
were kids, watch the sun coming up.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.197
That was Sam Merlotte.

50:34.282 --> 50:37.774
Yup. I done that before.

50:39.412 --> 50:40.697
Where the fuck was he going?

50:41.289 --> 50:43.075
Where has he been?

50:43.249 --> 50:45.205
Nobody cares.

50:51.799 --> 50:53.926
Detective Bellefleur.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.462
Shit.

51:23.957 --> 51:27.825
As soon as we complete our portion,
you can get in there and start investigating.

51:28.002 --> 51:30.618
It's probably arson, I'll say that.

51:30.797 --> 51:33.584
Now we know one way to get rid of them.

51:34.509 --> 51:37.626
-Excuse me. Please, stay out of the way.
-Excuse me.

51:38.179 --> 51:40.636
Special of the day, country fried vampire.

51:40.807 --> 51:44.299
This'll take the heat off them having
to find out who's killing those women.

51:44.811 --> 51:46.722
Was Bill in there?

51:47.772 --> 51:49.854
No way of knowing.

51:50.024 --> 51:52.857
-They're awful messy.
-But there was four of them.
