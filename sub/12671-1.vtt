01:15.375 --> 01:17.275
It's due tomorrow.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.909
- What's due tomorrow?
- My paper.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.518
What My Dad Does for a Living.
It's due tomorrow.

01:25.685 --> 01:26.913
Oh, yeah.

01:33.726 --> 01:37.958
I own a company
that owns a lot of other companies.

01:38.131 --> 01:41.259
- What kind of companies?
- Retail mostly.

01:41.434 --> 01:47.202
Clothes, shoes, pharmaceuticals,
some high-tech stuff.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.864
Okay, but what do you actually do?

01:50.043 --> 01:51.135
I make money.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.346
And it's difficult to explain
to someone your age.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.355
Despite everything...

02:41.828 --> 02:43.887
...I love you, Daddy.

02:59.779 --> 03:00.905
Up and at them.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.980
Hey, Jimmy.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.974
You're on your way, Dougie.

03:05.151 --> 03:06.846
Good luck.

03:09.656 --> 03:10.714
Steve.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.380
All right.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.054
My man.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.353
- Thanks.
- Right, man.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.655
- Good luck.
- Get up, get up. It's Dougie's day.

03:17.830 --> 03:21.698
He's getting out. Let's go. Get up.
Hey, Dougie's going. Come on, get up.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.392
Let's go, guys. One, two, three.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.037
Let's go.

03:39.452 --> 03:41.682
I don't know why, guys,
but I'm gonna miss you.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.590
For about five minutes.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.232
Dougie!

04:03.042 --> 04:04.634
Later, Dad.

04:38.544 --> 04:41.138
Well, you won't be seeing much more
of me anytime soon.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.609
- Are you sure?
- That's my girl, man.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.149
That karma will come back to you.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.684
- Baby.
- Baby.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.185
- Baby.
- Thank you.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.481
Hi.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.621
I missed you.

04:57.430 --> 05:01.764
Baby, before we wear the paint
off the hood of the car...

05:02.068 --> 05:04.536
...let's take this somewhere
with a mattress.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.438
Oh, baby, this came for you today.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.809
Registered mail. Looked important.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.931
Baby, what's the matter?

05:33.900 --> 05:35.891
- Hey--
- My father's dead.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.928
I thought you were an orphan.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.641
Even orphans have fathers somewhere.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.405
No, Ma,
I don't care what your landlady said.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.309
What did the--? Ma, what did the--?

05:49.482 --> 05:52.178
Ma, what did the doctor say?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.088
Any chance I could talk you
out of a smoke?

05:56.255 --> 05:57.882
No chance in hell. Walk away.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.491
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mommy.
I'm sorry.

06:00.827 --> 06:03.227
You're telling me
that you're going back to a guy...

06:03.396 --> 06:07.059
...who's idea of romance
is two-for-one night at the dog track?

06:07.233 --> 06:08.962
I'm right here, okay?

06:09.135 --> 06:12.229
And I treat you like a goddess.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.696
What do you mean,
"maybe that's my problem"?

06:14.874 --> 06:18.537
Hey, I can be a bad boy too
if that's what gets you off.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.736
Hold on, I'm getting another call!

06:21.147 --> 06:22.774
No, no, sweetheart, no, no, no.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.008
I'm just-- I'm being a bad boy, okay?

06:25.184 --> 06:26.583
It was like the role play--

06:26.753 --> 06:29.278
Just hold on, I'm sorry. Hold on.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.685
Make it quick, okay?

06:33.593 --> 06:35.788
What do you mean Rodriguez is gone?

06:35.962 --> 06:38.089
Do you mean "gone" gone?

06:38.264 --> 06:40.732
Because if that's the "gone"
you're talking about...

06:40.900 --> 06:44.631
...I would appreciate it if you drove
down here and shot me in the face!

06:44.804 --> 06:47.932
Because it would be very comforting
for me to be dead right now!

06:48.107 --> 06:49.836
- Mikey.
- Hey, Leo, special delivery.

06:50.009 --> 06:51.408
Thanks. Look...

06:51.577 --> 06:54.705
...Rodriguez is the biggest bail
that I have ever laid out...

06:54.881 --> 06:58.647
...in my entire life-sucking,
miserable career and....

07:00.253 --> 07:02.118
Hold on a second.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.892
You know what? It's only money.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.021
Come on, buddy, what--?

07:40.860 --> 07:41.952
Son of a--

07:47.300 --> 07:49.598
Jimmy, it's a hit! Get on the floor!

08:10.122 --> 08:13.319
-All right, come on. Let's go.
-All right, all right. All right.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.294
- Get inside.
- Let's go.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.297
Nicely done, boys. Let's giddyup.

08:44.657 --> 08:48.184
My God, man.
But you did hit that son of a bitch sweet.

08:48.794 --> 08:51.024
But did you have to jack him up
on national TV?

08:52.465 --> 08:53.989
- I was frustrated.
- Frustrated?

08:54.166 --> 08:56.430
You look like the poster boy
for bipolar disorder.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.298
This guy rapes a 10-year-old
and gets off.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.204
I got a 10-year-old.

09:05.278 --> 09:09.715
How I wish you'd have killed him. It would
take the sting out of losing my best cop.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.651
I need your gun, et cetera.

09:13.819 --> 09:18.950
I will try to clean this up
and get you back on the job ASAP.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.286
- Sorry, cap.
- Sam, your sister called.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.587
She wanted you to call right back.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.030
They expect him to do a lot of reading?

09:29.201 --> 09:32.136
Leo, the undertaker thought
it made him look more natural.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.078
I can't read it when it's hot.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.572
By the pool on Vegas,
I don't know how they do it.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.717
We're talking Baghdad hot
where you're going, old man.

09:51.958 --> 09:55.758
- It's a dry heat.
- Will you please show some respect.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.892
I need quiet when I read.
He should have plenty of that.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.169
- That was funny, kid.
- It wasn't supposed to be funny.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.104
- What was your name again?
- Douglas.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.767
Listen to me, all of you.

10:12.945 --> 10:17.814
The man that lays here before us
was a very different man in his final days.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.612
He changed a great deal for the good.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.913
Yeah, you can tell by the sellout crowd.

10:23.089 --> 10:25.455
Then you're gonna have
to take my word for it, Sam.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.025
You'll all get your money
but we stand here quietly!

10:28.361 --> 10:30.829
- Okay, okay.
- Pay respect to our father as a family.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.589
Understood?

10:32.765 --> 10:33.823
- Yup.
- Yeah.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.503
I'm sorry. Okay?

10:48.681 --> 10:50.148
I'm sorry.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.989
Don't even think about it.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.110
Please.
How much money for you to help me?

11:21.280 --> 11:22.304
Do you understand?

11:25.017 --> 11:26.041
Anything you want.

11:26.552 --> 11:30.352
Anything in the world you want
if you help me.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.684
Can you buy me a place in heaven?

11:38.698 --> 11:41.166
Well, we-- Wait, wait.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.997
Your father's will reads pretty standard.

11:46.872 --> 11:53.505
After a lot of legal mumbo jumbo,
it all boils down to about $3 million.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.005
A piece.

11:58.684 --> 12:01.050
- What?
- Three million each.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.381
Oh, my God, I'm free at last!

12:07.560 --> 12:10.757
Thank you, Lord almighty.
I'm free at last!

12:12.331 --> 12:15.767
Substantial estate. I thought he meant,
like, a two-bedroom condo in Boca.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.766
A family and money at the same time.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.029
What did the old man do?

12:19.205 --> 12:23.471
-Did he rob a bank or something?
- It turns out his fifth wife was well-off.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.607
Was she sucking on a tailpipe
when he proposed to her?

12:26.779 --> 12:29.339
Leo, please.
She loved him very much till she died.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.449
The old man's prints were all over that.

12:31.617 --> 12:32.811
Oh, good Lord, stop.

12:32.985 --> 12:37.115
Daddy left us his money, that's the bottom
line. But there are some contingencies.

12:37.289 --> 12:40.190
What contingencies? What are you
talking about? Is it in pesos?

12:40.359 --> 12:45.296
Why don't I go get a cup of Joe
and you kids...

12:45.464 --> 12:47.728
- ...sort this out.
- Okay.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.560
First of all...

12:50.069 --> 12:52.731
...Daddy left me the executor
of the estate.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.567
That seems to make a lot of sense.
Somebody we all trust.

12:55.741 --> 12:59.108
Yes, because if you give the money
to Leo, he'll piss it away.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.545
Look, I know you think
that you're this big, mature man...

13:02.715 --> 13:04.580
- ...but I run a business, okay?
- Stop it.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.115
- Stop.
- I'm a business man.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.912
There's more.

13:08.487 --> 13:11.183
- Okay.
- You will get the money...

13:11.357 --> 13:16.056
...if you work together in a family business
for two years.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.258
That's easy.

13:28.607 --> 13:30.006
Well.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.509
- Douglas, right?
- Yeah.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.838
- Nice knowing you, kid. Have a good life.
- Sam. Oh, Sam.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.107
- Nina.
- Sam.

13:37.283 --> 13:40.446
I love you very much, Nina,
but this is not funny!

13:40.953 --> 13:43.513
Hey, let's open a deli.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.887
It was his dying wish
to bring us back together as a family.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.587
His dying wish.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.063
Doesn't that mean anything to you,
Sam?

13:55.234 --> 13:57.862
What are we gonna do together
without killing each other?

13:58.037 --> 13:59.834
- You know your problem?
- I got ideas.

14:00.005 --> 14:04.203
You're not a glass-half-empty kind of guy.
You're a shove-the-glass-up-your-ass guy.

14:04.376 --> 14:07.868
You figured that this wasn't working
before you even walked in that door.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.572
I love family. We haven't
seen each other in 10 years.

14:10.749 --> 14:13.377
- We hate each other like it was yesterday!
- Sam, stop it.

14:13.552 --> 14:18.216
That reminds me. Just because junior
here is supposedly the old man's seed...

14:18.390 --> 14:20.415
...doesn't mean he's earned a fair share.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.653
- He never met the bastard.
- He's Daddy's son, your half brother...

14:23.829 --> 14:25.694
...and I have the documents to prove it.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.992
Okay?
You all need this money desperately.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.863
You have alimony,
you have college tuitions up the road...

14:31.036 --> 14:34.699
...you are suspended without pay.
And you, you're a bail bondsman, really?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.900
What?
I provide a service to the community.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.841
Yeah, in hock up to your eyeballs.
And you, a thief.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.708
I'm a good thief.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.578
Like Brad Pitt in Ocean's Eleven.
Maybe you've seen it.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.685
I'll be sure to rent the DVD. Thank you.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.344
Now I'm not saying
you don't have good reason.

14:50.522 --> 14:53.685
But this is a blessing, a second chance
to become a family again.

14:53.859 --> 14:59.126
That was his dying wish
and you will honor it even if it kills you.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.564
We interrupt this broadcast
for a special report.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.568
Billionaire businessman, Kyle Wills,
was kidnapped today...

15:05.738 --> 15:07.205
... while en route to his office.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.432
Eyewitness reports
from shocked onlookers...

15:09.608 --> 15:13.840
...described a chaotic scene in which
as many as five armed and masked men--

15:14.013 --> 15:16.982
So, what was it like
growing up together, guys?

15:18.484 --> 15:22.545
Come on, I grew up in child facilities
and foster homes but had a good time.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.552
- You wanna know what it's like?
- Yeah.

15:26.725 --> 15:29.091
All right, I'll give you a little taste.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.253
You ever played the game
"Got you last"?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.831
- No.
- Oh, it's great, man.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.797
All right, what you do is...

15:37.102 --> 15:39.730
...you hit each other back and forth,
boom, boom, boom...

15:39.905 --> 15:42.430
...till one guy gets the other guy
really good.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.470
And then you run away
and you say, "Got you last."

15:46.645 --> 15:49.910
All right? Then the other guy
chases after you and try to get you back.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.516
It starts all over again. Good times.
A lot of fun.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.082
Except for when you play it with Sam.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.289
Because you know what Sam would do?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.222
I would finally get him once,
real good.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.225
And I'd run off.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.762
But he wouldn't chase after me.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.601
And then I would live in fear...

16:09.768 --> 16:11.793
...for hours, sometimes even days...

16:11.971 --> 16:15.429
...wondering when Big Bad Sam
was gonna attack me.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.440
And you know what your brother
from another mother would do?

16:21.280 --> 16:23.612
He would set his alarm...

16:23.816 --> 16:25.716
...for 3 a.m...

16:25.884 --> 16:27.408
...and walk into my room...

16:27.586 --> 16:30.714
...when I was still sleeping
and slap the shit out of me.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.991
And I'd be laying there
looking up at this monster...

16:34.159 --> 16:38.425
...and he'd lean down
and he'd say, "Got you last."

16:39.565 --> 16:41.260
That's the funniest game we played.

16:41.433 --> 16:44.561
The rest, I keep between myself
and my therapist.

16:44.737 --> 16:48.070
- Grow up.
- Kiss my ass, Sam.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.369
- Got you last.
- You all right?

16:54.546 --> 16:57.174
--inside the warehouse,
and then proceeded on their way.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.407
A homeless woman...

16:58.584 --> 16:59.608
I'm gonna kill you!

16:59.785 --> 17:02.618
...identified Edgar Rodriguez
as one of the Wills kidnappers.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.685
According to the FBI,
Rodriguez is an escaped fugitive...

17:06.858 --> 17:08.588
...facing charges for grand theft--

17:08.761 --> 17:10.387
That's my bail skip.

17:10.561 --> 17:13.326
The Wills family is offering
a 5 million-dollar reward...

17:13.499 --> 17:17.435
...for any information directly resulting
in the billionaire's safe return.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.408
Take this.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.985
Ten mils of Valium.
You'll think you're at Club Med.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.520
I don't need this.

17:37.689 --> 17:41.284
I'm doing you a favor. Now, take it
or I'll shove it down your throat.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.451
Okay.

17:43.629 --> 17:47.190
So all of our communications
with the FBI...

17:47.366 --> 17:49.800
...are done through computer.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.170
Very high-tech,
you wouldn't understand.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.738
You're only good
at destroying computer companies.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.069
Don't know jack shit
about how to use them.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.870
May I talk with my family, somehow?

18:00.045 --> 18:03.606
Will you please shut up?
You think I'm some kind of ogre?

18:03.949 --> 18:06.816
See the camera? What do you think
I bought that for, numbnuts?

18:07.186 --> 18:10.087
They see you, you see them,
everybody cries, beg for mercy...

18:10.255 --> 18:11.745
...et cetera, et cetera.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.382
Now, the feds are gonna wanna
make sure that you're alive.

18:15.561 --> 18:19.019
So I've rigged a live feed
of the Dow Jones stock ticker...

18:19.198 --> 18:20.722
...to run across the screen.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.364
That way,
you can read real time stock quotes...

18:23.535 --> 18:26.504
...and see just how far
your company's gone in the toilet...

18:26.672 --> 18:29.573
...because their leader
is about to die a horrible death...

18:29.741 --> 18:31.572
...unless they pay up.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.108
It's cool, huh?

18:34.913 --> 18:36.608
Okay.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.775
Leo needs a favor.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.079
Yeah.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.656
I was thinking,
until we figure out what it is...

18:46.825 --> 18:49.658
...that we could do
as a "family business," you know...

18:49.828 --> 18:52.695
...I've got a little situation
I could use a little help with.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.127
How can I help, bro?

18:55.434 --> 18:58.096
"Bro?" What are you, 12 years old?

18:58.270 --> 19:00.363
Next, you're gonna be asking me
to high-five.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.337
Leo, do you want help or not?
Beggars can't be choosers.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.438
Right. Sorry.

19:06.078 --> 19:11.607
Turns out, since I won't be getting
at the old man's cut for two years...

19:11.783 --> 19:14.183
...I'm in a little bit of a financial bind.

19:14.453 --> 19:18.719
See, I posted this bond
on this guy, Edgar Rodriguez...

19:18.891 --> 19:22.019
...for $250,000 and he skipped on me.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.626
If he doesn't show up
for his trial next week...

19:24.796 --> 19:26.559
...I'm on the hook for the $250,000.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.962
- This is a nightmare.
- I know. Tell me about it.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.601
But the good news is...

19:30.769 --> 19:33.431
...it seems Rodriguez is involved
with that kidnapping...

19:33.605 --> 19:36.631
...that's all over the news,
so we got that going for us.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.833
EcoSummit down 44.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.342
Smith & Yale down four.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.537
Solomon Gold up 16.

19:42.714 --> 19:46.241
Volume's light, 630 million shares.

19:46.418 --> 19:49.216
Susan, Janson, I'm okay.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.356
Janson. Janson, I want--

19:53.559 --> 19:57.051
He knows we can trace it.
We'll never get any more than that.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.525
The old man's probably laughing
his ass off.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.566
You know this was his plan all along.

20:04.736 --> 20:06.067
No, it wasn't, okay?

20:06.238 --> 20:09.207
He knew it would take that long.
Especially with you.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.207
Sammy the bullheaded,
you're just like him.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.640
You're the only one on this planet...

20:18.817 --> 20:21.718
...I would let compare me to him.
I want you to know that.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.113
What would you do?

20:25.290 --> 20:28.953
Slap me around like one of your perps,
huh?

20:29.127 --> 20:31.618
Now, wouldn't that bring down
the wrath of God?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.722
You should have been a nun.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.261
Yeah.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.426
Cheated on my husband,
ruined my marriage...

20:38.604 --> 20:40.572
...and ex-communicated from the church.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.140
I got two failed marriages.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.970
A kid who barely knows me.
I'm damned to hell for sure.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.479
Chips off the old block, huh?

20:48.647 --> 20:49.978
That's bogus, though.

20:50.148 --> 20:53.481
You know, it's time you grew up
and just stopped blaming him.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.348
Now, it's up to us.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.589
I love my brothers...

21:01.760 --> 21:05.457
...unconditionally, even you.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.262
Even the one I just met.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.730
Really? What's his name?

21:09.901 --> 21:11.493
Douglas.

21:11.670 --> 21:15.231
- He seems very sweet.
- For a juvenile delinquent.

21:15.407 --> 21:18.274
Well, you're no prince either
and I still love you.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.775
That's kind of how family works.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.507
- You're actually gonna help me out?
- FBI's gonna throw every agent at this.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.481
Wills is a huge contributor
to the Republican party.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.245
They're gonna find Rodriguez.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.652
No, but they're not gonna be looking
for Rodriguez, not just yet.

21:32.824 --> 21:36.385
They know this guy is not smart enough
to pull off something this big.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.257
He's nothing but a lieutenant
with the cartels in Mexico.

21:39.431 --> 21:42.696
So interfere with FBI investigation
and be killed by the cartels?

21:42.868 --> 21:45.894
Yeah,
but there's a 5 million dollar reward.

21:46.071 --> 21:48.835
But we're not looking for Wills
so there is no 5 million.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.599
So we split your bond.

21:50.776 --> 21:53.108
That's what, 10 percent on 250 grand?

21:53.278 --> 21:57.146
Twenty-five grand split three ways
is 8,333 and change.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.715
No, listen, Einstein.

21:58.884 --> 22:02.479
The deal was we work together, okay?
We split the old man's money.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.848
That bond is mine.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.456
No, no. This counts as part
of our two-year sentence.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.593
The deal was,
anything the company makes...

22:08.760 --> 22:11.456
...gets split three ways. That's the deal.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.191
Tell me what you know.

22:14.566 --> 22:18.127
Slow down, turbo.
I see the way things are going here.

22:18.303 --> 22:21.670
You're snapping out orders
and expecting the two of us to just eat shit.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.640
No. Nina said that we work together
as a team.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.802
Oh, well, thank you, John Wooden.

22:27.979 --> 22:29.810
I'm a cop. That's what I do.

22:29.981 --> 22:33.178
Along the way, I'll figure out what
contribution you make to the team.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.014
- Until then, I'm stumped.
- Please. Please.

22:36.388 --> 22:37.821
Listen.

22:38.156 --> 22:41.489
Rodriguez was running his mouth off
about this girl that he was dating.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.150
This famous stripper in Mexico.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.387
Know how many strip clubs
are in Mexico City?

22:45.564 --> 22:47.589
She's famous, right?
That narrows it down.

22:47.766 --> 22:50.428
Angelina. Angelina. That was her name.

22:50.602 --> 22:53.298
It was a singular name, like Madonna.

22:53.472 --> 22:56.873
Sam, just hear me out, okay?
Hear me out.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.669
If Rodriguez is involved...

22:58.844 --> 23:01.335
...he's involved
because of his connections...

23:01.513 --> 23:03.037
...to the cartel in Mexico.

23:03.215 --> 23:07.049
So it's my guess that
that's where they're hiding Wills.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.759
We're gonna need money to get started.

23:18.563 --> 23:19.860
So how much do you need?

23:20.499 --> 23:21.966
Fifteen thousand.

23:22.134 --> 23:25.365
That will get us started.
I'll call you when we need more.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.865
- Fifteen grand?
- Yeah.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.373
Well, you know,
I plan running a tight ship, Sam.

23:32.544 --> 23:37.038
I do not wanna dip into Daddy's funds
until you've all proven yourself a bit.

23:37.649 --> 23:41.779
So 10,000 will have to do, no more.

23:43.054 --> 23:46.023
You're being a little tight with 12 million,
don't you think?

23:46.591 --> 23:48.081
It's not our money yet.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.161
The company needs to prove itself,
it has to be successful.

23:51.329 --> 23:53.320
I think 10,000 is fair.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.732
Okay. You hold the purse strings.
We'll see how it goes.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.097
Okay.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.570
Well, you will be careful, won't you?
I mean, you'll look after them?

24:02.741 --> 24:04.106
They're grown-ups, Nina.

24:04.276 --> 24:08.007
- I'll do my job, I'm not a babysitter.
- No, I know, but they are your family.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.580
I'd keep pushing the money angle
if I were you, kid.

24:10.749 --> 24:11.807
I'll see you in a week.

24:14.753 --> 24:16.516
Yeah.

24:32.537 --> 24:34.095
So, Sam, what's first?

24:34.272 --> 24:36.797
We take a little nap
and then we hit the strip clubs.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.739
It's pretty much my normal routine
in every new town.

24:39.911 --> 24:42.072
No. We call every club in town...

24:42.247 --> 24:45.580
...and see if they've a famous
one-name stripper, Angelina.

24:45.750 --> 24:49.379
Should take about a lifetime. Moron.

24:53.391 --> 24:55.382
It might not take as long
as you guys think.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.150
Edgar is a very dangerous man.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.617
He would easily kill me
if he thought I was a help to you.

26:02.894 --> 26:06.261
I haven't seen him
since he left for America...

26:06.932 --> 26:08.024
...over a month ago.

26:08.199 --> 26:11.726
Listen, Angelina. You don't have
to be afraid of him anymore, okay?

26:11.903 --> 26:13.427
Because we can protect you.

26:13.605 --> 26:16.039
No, we can't.
Don't offer anything you can't deliver.

26:16.207 --> 26:19.643
It wouldn't matter. I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

26:37.128 --> 26:38.993
Yeah, get him, Little Joe!

26:39.965 --> 26:41.830
No, no, no. Come on.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.298
Listen, Angelina,
I wrote down my cell number.

26:44.469 --> 26:48.667
If you ever need anything at all,
don't hesitate to call.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.101
Oh, my God.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.303
That was like a bad Bonanza episode?

26:55.480 --> 26:57.038
What is a Bonanza episode?

26:57.215 --> 26:59.775
Oh, man, it's this great television show
about this guy.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.044
He had three sons,
all from different mothers.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.279
Very, very relatable to our situation.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.755
Sammy and l, we would sit and watch
the reruns when we were younger.

27:07.926 --> 27:11.885
And pretty much the only time when we
weren't beating each other up, right?

27:12.063 --> 27:14.031
- A stupid show.
- No, it was a great show.

27:14.199 --> 27:18.192
It was classic, iconic television.
I can't believe you've never seen Bonanza.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.338
- They didn't have Nick at Nite?
- No.

27:21.272 --> 27:23.035
You would be a perfect
Little Joe, man.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.368
- The youngest.
- Yeah.

27:24.542 --> 27:27.170
- Who would you be? Hoss?
- No, no. You're Hoss.

27:27.345 --> 27:29.210
Big pecs, Popeye forearms. Perfect.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.849
Hoss was defined by his stupidity
rather than size.

27:32.017 --> 27:33.484
And a middle child, you be Hoss.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.984
- Eat me.
- Thanks for helping me out in there, Sam.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.348
Like a big brother should.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.154
Brothers? I'm a cop.
I was stopping a homicide.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.559
Wow, you're a dick.

27:43.194 --> 27:45.185
It's cool. It's cool. I don't care.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.825
Look, the bottom line is,
we have nothing on Rodriguez.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.266
Not necessarily. She gave me
her apartment number, told me to stop by.

27:53.438 --> 27:55.463
She said she was having a party.

28:03.581 --> 28:06.015
Don't press too hard for information.
She's scared.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.276
Take it nice and easy.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.579
Look, you're sending a boy
to do a man's job.

28:09.754 --> 28:11.244
She asked for the kid. Not you.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.620
I know, but it's a party.
So I could go up there and I could mingle--

28:14.793 --> 28:16.658
Whatever. Anything in that apartment...

28:16.828 --> 28:18.887
...anything that gets us closer
to Rodriguez.

28:19.064 --> 28:20.088
Okay.

28:20.265 --> 28:23.029
All right, I'll do my best.
Wish me good luck.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.192
Yeah, right. Just go.

28:26.971 --> 28:30.907
She's gonna chew him up
and spit him out.

28:49.594 --> 28:51.357
- Hello.
- Hello.

28:52.130 --> 28:55.122
- I thought there was a party?
- There is.

28:55.300 --> 28:58.269
- Am I early?
- No.

28:58.536 --> 29:00.197
You are the party.

30:12.443 --> 30:13.967
Thank you.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.737
Thank you, Jesus...

30:15.914 --> 30:17.609
...for answering my prayers.

30:17.782 --> 30:19.340
Oh, you make too much of it.

30:19.517 --> 30:23.419
I've got a certain gift, for sure,
but, yeah, you know.

30:34.799 --> 30:35.993
Edgar.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.363
I will kill your young friend...

30:38.536 --> 30:40.800
...and make love one last time
before I kill you.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.166
Edgar, you said tomorrow!

30:42.340 --> 30:44.035
Because I'm early, this is okay?

30:44.209 --> 30:45.506
Edgar, please.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.338
Kill me, but not him.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.173
He's an innocent and blessed by God.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.880
Well, there goes Leo's 200 grand.

31:00.758 --> 31:03.056
Yeah, he's gonna be disappointed.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.504
What happened?

31:21.045 --> 31:23.036
- What's going on?
- What did you guys get?

31:23.214 --> 31:26.479
Rodriguez's mother lives in a small town
called Vista Del Fuego.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.312
Him and her are pretty close.

31:28.486 --> 31:31.114
He told Angelina he was going to America
for a big score.

31:31.289 --> 31:33.655
Wait. Who told you this?
Was somebody at the party?

31:33.825 --> 31:36.123
It's Angelina. She was pretty nice.

31:36.294 --> 31:39.229
Wait, I don't get it.
She was all buttoned up at the strip club.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.627
- What made her change her mind?
- She was....

31:41.799 --> 31:43.858
- Vulnerable.
- What's that supposed to mean?

31:44.035 --> 31:45.059
- Leo.
- What?

31:45.236 --> 31:46.794
Rodriguez is dead.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.302
What do you mean?

31:48.473 --> 31:50.464
The kid was in the sack
with his girlfriend.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.439
Rodriguez showed up,
I had to shoot him.

31:52.610 --> 31:55.807
You were sleeping with the famous strip--
What did you just say?

31:55.980 --> 31:59.472
Did you say you shot Rodriguez?
What about my $200,000?

31:59.651 --> 32:02.415
We're gonna go after Wills
for the 5-million-dollar reward.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.055
All we need is information
leading to his safe return.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.487
Rodriguez had to know
where they're hiding Wills.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.559
Unfortunately, you shot him.

32:09.727 --> 32:11.820
Pretty fortunate
from where I was standing.

32:12.163 --> 32:14.597
Laying. You were laying, Romeo.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.200
Here's his wallet.
See if you can find anything.

32:17.368 --> 32:19.461
We get a lead,
we call the American Embassy...

32:19.637 --> 32:23.073
...we cash in on the $5,000,000,
and we get on with our separate lives.

32:32.383 --> 32:35.147
I have no idea where we are.

32:35.520 --> 32:39.286
Headed northeast, this is the only road.
We're gonna make it there eventually.

32:42.393 --> 32:44.088
So, what do you think of the kid?

32:44.562 --> 32:46.496
No way he came
from the old man's loins.

32:46.998 --> 32:48.022
Why do you say that?

32:48.333 --> 32:49.800
He's not a big enough asshole.

32:51.035 --> 32:53.230
Are you actually admitting
you're an asshole?

32:53.404 --> 32:55.395
- We're both assholes.
- No.

32:55.573 --> 32:57.541
Don't drag me
into your personal nightmare.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.267
I happen to be a very decent guy.

33:02.113 --> 33:06.049
Just because a drunk admits he's a drunk
doesn't make him any more sober.

33:06.217 --> 33:09.152
Just trying to bond with you, Leo.
I heard misery loves company.

33:09.454 --> 33:14.482
It works the same with misery or without.
It just depends on the company, asshole.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.864
Leave all your valuables in the truck.

33:25.036 --> 33:27.869
One vacancy
in this entire pissant town?

33:28.039 --> 33:30.872
Come on, what is this?
A convention destination?

33:31.042 --> 33:34.170
I've slept on bathroom floors
that were bigger than that hotel room.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.007
I had a cell in juvie
that was, like, 6-by-6.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.411
You have to double up
in a place like that.

33:39.584 --> 33:42.712
It was a slow week, thank God.
I had the whole place to myself.

33:42.887 --> 33:46.015
- I'm pretty lucky like that.
- Yeah, a regular horseshoe up your ass.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.250
There's no way I'm sleeping in a bed
with either one of you guys.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.088
- Fine. Sleep in the truck.
- Come on.

33:51.262 --> 33:54.095
I'll take the floor,
you guys take the beds.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.092
Listen to him, man. He's a puppy dog.

33:57.268 --> 34:00.533
He's cute, cuddly, chicks dig him,
and he'll sleep on the floor.

34:04.942 --> 34:08.935
Guys, we gotta be careful.
We stick out like sore thumbs in this town.

34:09.112 --> 34:12.446
Man, it's beautiful here.
I wish I spoke Spanish.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.676
I wanna immerse myself
in the local culture.

34:19.757 --> 34:23.158
How's that for local culture? Dive in.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.190
Puppy dog.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.813
Señora Rodriguez?

34:48.719 --> 34:49.777
Habla English?

34:49.954 --> 34:51.420
You speak any English?

34:52.255 --> 34:54.281
- No.
- Señora Rodriguez.

34:59.263 --> 35:02.096
We got a bilingual brother.
That's gonna come in handy here.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.234
Now he can get us killed
in two languages.

35:04.702 --> 35:05.828
Excuse me.

35:22.753 --> 35:23.845
No, no, no.

35:27.825 --> 35:28.849
See if that helps.

35:45.343 --> 35:48.210
Ask about the woman in the picture.
She may be in danger.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.279
- Mama.
- Hey, kid.

36:15.406 --> 36:16.998
Rodriguez is dead.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.699
They tracked him down here.

36:18.876 --> 36:21.344
You gonna sit there
and tell me you had this figured?

36:21.512 --> 36:23.912
Leave them little pieces of cheese
to find us with?

36:24.081 --> 36:25.480
Make it more interesting?

36:27.752 --> 36:33.622
An FBI agent was quoted in the article.
The bureau is claiming no responsibility.

36:33.791 --> 36:34.883
And you believe them?

36:35.893 --> 36:37.554
I worked for them 10 years.

36:38.296 --> 36:41.663
They'll consider it a huge failure
if they don't bring Wills back alive.

36:41.999 --> 36:44.729
Whoever killed Rodriguez
doesn't give a damn about Wills.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.367
Let me worry about it, will you?

36:47.638 --> 36:51.165
Okay. But while you're worrying,
get off my computer.

36:51.342 --> 36:53.537
It took me a month
to put in money transfers...

36:53.711 --> 36:57.272
- ...and you're gonna crash it playing cards.
- All right.

36:57.448 --> 36:59.382
If feds didn't kill Rodriguez, then who?

36:59.550 --> 37:03.611
In the world Rodriguez lives in,
I'm sure the list is endless.

37:03.821 --> 37:06.517
It doesn't matter, it's not connected.

37:06.691 --> 37:10.422
Yeah. Except now Rodriguez is dead,
we're in the middle of Mexico.

37:10.595 --> 37:13.063
We don't have the Mexican
who brought us to the dance!

37:13.231 --> 37:16.792
We don't need him anymore.
It's all preset.

37:16.968 --> 37:20.301
But you know what? Why don't we send
Bertram and Bermutti into town.

37:20.471 --> 37:22.530
See if anyone
has been looking around.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.716
Hey.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.325
You speak Spanish, you do the talking.

37:45.229 --> 37:47.561
What, Sam?
You saying you need me all of a sudden?

37:47.732 --> 37:51.793
No. For some reason, you sound smarter
when I don't know what you're saying.

37:52.903 --> 37:54.871
Hey, could you teach me?

37:55.473 --> 37:57.839
- What?
- Spanish.

37:58.409 --> 38:00.309
Yeah, I'll loan you the tapes.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.470
I got it. Thanks.

38:06.984 --> 38:09.509
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

38:10.688 --> 38:13.054
Really? You speak English?

38:13.224 --> 38:15.488
Theresa,
we're friends with Edgar Rodriguez.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.458
- He said you may be able to help us.
- He's dead.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.959
Did you know
that about your friend Edgar?

38:22.833 --> 38:23.857
Are you police?

38:24.035 --> 38:27.801
Gee, everybody is just paranoid
about the cops around here, aren't they?

38:27.972 --> 38:31.203
- I guess it crosses all borders, right?
- We're not the police.

38:31.375 --> 38:33.935
You hear anything
about the kidnapping of the American?

38:34.111 --> 38:35.135
I can read.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.012
If you're not police, you should leave.

38:38.182 --> 38:41.515
Or my grandfather is going to blow
a hole through this door and ruin it.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.313
Yup, in that case, I lied.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.687
Just heard
Mexicans are friendly people.

38:46.857 --> 38:49.724
I'm half Indian. We're not so friendly.

38:54.732 --> 38:57.929
- I haven't seen Edgar in two years.
- Your picture was in his wallet.

38:58.102 --> 39:01.333
I assure you, you won't find
a picture of him in my wallet.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.973
- You can check.
- No, there's no need.

39:04.775 --> 39:07.539
- She's telling the truth.
- Got a crystal ball up your ass?

39:07.712 --> 39:10.010
- How's that fit with the horseshoe?
- I just know.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.706
- But I can only do it with women--
- You're not a cop.

39:12.883 --> 39:15.477
No, I'm not a cop.
I'm his brother and his brother too.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.144
- She doesn't need to know.
- How do you know Rodriguez?

39:18.322 --> 39:20.517
- We grew up together.
- We don't know anything...

39:20.691 --> 39:23.091
...about your country,
but we could use some help.

39:23.260 --> 39:26.661
There's a reward for information
leading to the return of the American.

39:26.831 --> 39:29.698
- We'll pay an equal share.
- An equal share? Are you crazy?

39:29.867 --> 39:32.495
- Ten percent, max.
- I want no part of it.

39:32.770 --> 39:36.069
When I found out Edgar died,
I felt nothing.

39:40.344 --> 39:42.835
- lf she is lying, she's damn good.
- She's not lying.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.043
It's time for you to leave.

39:47.518 --> 39:50.715
See, that's great. Back to square one.

39:51.455 --> 39:52.547
Charmed.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.521
Sorry. We're just kind of
out of our place here.

39:55.693 --> 39:58.685
- You're very kind. Thank you.
- Thank you very much. Okay.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.995
Thought they take your badge
when they fire you.

40:03.167 --> 40:06.227
I wasn't fired, I was suspended.
I keep an old badge just in case.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.530
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah?

40:07.705 --> 40:11.801
Rule number one in team play:
Never tell anybody anything until we talk.

40:11.976 --> 40:14.206
Okay. Would you have
asked her for help?

40:14.378 --> 40:16.471
- No.
- Oh, but it's completely okay...

40:16.647 --> 40:19.411
...for you to offer a complete stranger
an equal share.

40:19.583 --> 40:22.347
What the hell is that?
You know, there's no I in team, Sam.

40:22.520 --> 40:26.115
Yeah, but there's an I in family,
and I'm still the oldest, so shut up.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.328
You wanna know what's going on
in a neighborhood...

40:33.497 --> 40:34.725
...go to a local bar.

40:34.899 --> 40:38.630
This is the type of local bar that you go to
if you wanna get shot for no reason.

40:38.803 --> 40:41.533
You speak the language, Leo.
They'll respect that.

40:41.705 --> 40:45.505
You bet. How do I beg for my life in
Spanish? Just so-- What are you doing?

40:45.676 --> 40:48.110
This is how you beg for your life
in Spanish.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.339
- Good God, Leo. You hunting a bear?
- You got a license for that?

40:51.515 --> 40:54.075
I'm a bail bondsman,
not a kindergarten teacher.

40:54.485 --> 40:57.420
Packing that little baby cop peashooters
of yours?

40:57.588 --> 40:59.419
- It will do.
- All right.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.080
You got anything you can use?

41:01.258 --> 41:04.318
- I don't care for guns, man.
- You'll make a fine-looking corpse.

41:04.495 --> 41:07.362
Tell you what, just stay here
and keep the engine running.

41:07.531 --> 41:08.896
Yeah.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.458
Be careful.

41:34.592 --> 41:37.288
Yeah, it's a grande mamón.

41:39.029 --> 41:40.587
What was that about?

41:40.931 --> 41:43.798
You know, see what me
speaking the language does?

41:44.068 --> 41:46.730
It turns the whole table around,
puts me in control.

41:46.904 --> 41:48.997
And I can see how much you hate it.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.835
It's not a competition.
You'll get your head blown off...

41:52.009 --> 41:54.876
- ...in a place like this.
- All right, fair enough.

41:55.246 --> 42:00.206
All right, basically, you want me to pretend
like you wanna buy drugs?

42:01.418 --> 42:03.386
- When in Rome.
- Okay.

42:03.554 --> 42:05.886
See if you can get something
from the bartender.

42:06.457 --> 42:07.515
Hey.

42:09.493 --> 42:10.687
Yeah.

42:31.415 --> 42:32.712
Right.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.475
Well....

42:40.958 --> 42:43.188
Right? You would.

42:51.602 --> 42:53.001
Okay.

43:08.552 --> 43:10.611
- Crap.
- Gentlemen.

43:10.788 --> 43:13.120
Your friend here was double-parked.

43:13.290 --> 43:15.588
- Put your weapons on the bar.
- You heard him.

43:31.642 --> 43:34.167
We think the American, Kyle Wills,
may be hidden here.

43:34.478 --> 43:38.175
- You assume I've something to do with it?
- No. You have no motive.

43:38.782 --> 43:41.148
Good.
At least you are not a stupid policeman.

43:43.754 --> 43:46.018
- What then?
- lf Rodriguez was to bring him here...

43:46.190 --> 43:48.488
...he'd ask for your permission
out of respect.

43:48.659 --> 43:49.683
Maybe good sense.

43:49.860 --> 43:51.953
Rodriguez had no respect,
very little sense.

43:52.229 --> 43:56.495
He worked for me. He wanted to be me.
Can you blame him?

43:56.667 --> 43:58.999
Will the kidnappers be here
without you knowing it?

43:59.169 --> 44:02.161
If they are here, it's because
Rodriguez knew where to hide them.

44:02.339 --> 44:05.638
- Where I would have no concern.
- Does that place exist?

44:05.809 --> 44:09.301
- Where people aren't afraid of you?
- To know me is to be afraid.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.347
If within a thousand miles in any direction,
they know me.

44:12.516 --> 44:15.314
- Is there a place of no concern to you?
- Simple.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.011
A places where the soil is not fertile.

44:18.188 --> 44:19.712
I am a farmer, remember?

44:20.824 --> 44:22.519
- What about Indian land?
- Doubtful.

44:22.893 --> 44:24.690
They have their holy places.

44:24.862 --> 44:27.330
But there, the Indians
would have killed them by now.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.897
Maybe the canyons.

44:29.066 --> 44:32.399
If Wills is here, the U.S. government
is gonna bring more heat on you...

44:32.569 --> 44:35.629
...than you can afford.
I wanna find him first. I need your help.

44:35.806 --> 44:39.298
Even if I had something to do with it,
your government cannot prove it.

44:39.476 --> 44:41.410
You'll be dropped off back at your hotel.

44:41.578 --> 44:44.741
If you're not gone in 24 hours,
you will die here.

44:49.653 --> 44:51.177
Hey, hey.

44:58.729 --> 45:01.197
- Who were they?
- I don't know, you pig!

45:05.602 --> 45:08.036
You're gonna tell me,
you're gonna tell me right now.

45:15.813 --> 45:17.610
Father, no!

45:25.189 --> 45:27.555
I'm not getting out of this truck
without my hat.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.625
I'm not getting out without it.

45:29.793 --> 45:31.920
Hey! Hey! Is that necessary?

45:35.132 --> 45:37.293
I want my hat!

45:38.869 --> 45:40.564
- What do we do now?
- Get out of here.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.832
Are you kidding me?
What about my money, huh?

45:44.007 --> 45:47.875
I go back to work in three weeks.
This is ridiculous.

45:48.045 --> 45:49.273
No. No.

45:49.446 --> 45:51.880
Are you really gonna walk away
on this whole thing?

45:52.049 --> 45:53.880
Three million dollars for each of us...

45:54.051 --> 45:59.580
- ...but I don't get my piece without you.
- It ain't worth getting killed over.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.958
- It is for me.
- Give it up, Leo.

46:04.128 --> 46:06.096
- I've got nothing left!
- Hey.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.458
Hey. Sam.

46:10.534 --> 46:13.002
Sam, at least think about it
on your way home, man.

46:13.170 --> 46:15.161
Getting a chance to meet my family
meant--

46:15.339 --> 46:17.671
We ain't family!

46:17.841 --> 46:21.800
If there's no money involved in this,
we never meet.

46:21.979 --> 46:23.708
What does that tell you?

46:24.148 --> 46:27.914
I don't care about the money.
I'm just glad to meet you guys.

46:28.085 --> 46:31.054
I just wish I could've met my dad too,
man.

46:31.221 --> 46:33.212
Let me bring you up to speed
on your family.

46:33.390 --> 46:34.721
Your dad?

46:34.892 --> 46:37.656
An abusive drunk and a sex addict.
Four kids, four mothers.

46:38.595 --> 46:40.028
All right.

46:40.464 --> 46:42.659
Did you at least get a chance
to meet your mom?

46:42.833 --> 46:44.494
Yeah. Stripper.

46:44.668 --> 46:47.933
Raised me for three years,
put me on a doorstep. See you, bye.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.205
All right.

46:50.707 --> 46:51.731
What about Leo's mom?

46:51.909 --> 46:55.640
Cleaning lady for dad's bookie.
Died during childbirth.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.714
Don't worry, him and Nina's mom
had a pretty good run.

46:58.882 --> 47:00.543
Three, four years.

47:00.717 --> 47:02.548
They were drunk the whole time.

47:10.894 --> 47:12.191
Hey.

47:20.470 --> 47:22.461
- He must have had good qualities.
- Sure.

47:22.639 --> 47:26.075
He'd only beat up Leo because he
wouldn't hit a girl and was afraid of me.

47:26.243 --> 47:27.733
Wait.

47:30.814 --> 47:32.372
I rigged the door.

47:32.549 --> 47:35.211
Kids were always sneaking
into your rooms in juvie.

47:36.987 --> 47:39.148
Could be somebody still there,
wired the room.

47:39.323 --> 47:42.383
You gave him a key and told the room
because it's not broken into.

47:42.559 --> 47:46.427
Please. Please, a man was here
looking for you, but he's gone.

47:46.597 --> 47:51.057
- Verdugo's men?
- No. No. American. I did not know him.

48:00.244 --> 48:01.734
Open it.

48:13.957 --> 48:15.015
You see?

48:15.192 --> 48:16.352
Nothing.

48:20.297 --> 48:21.628
Wait. Get down!

48:35.512 --> 48:39.107
This your idea of an express checkout,
asshole?

48:39.917 --> 48:41.714
It's the same guys
who kidnapped Wills.

48:41.885 --> 48:44.683
They know Rodriguez is dead
and somehow made the connection.

48:44.855 --> 48:46.254
How did they know it was us?

48:46.423 --> 48:50.086
Because we're the only morons
with bull's-eyes on our foreheads.

48:50.260 --> 48:51.887
Do you still need help?

48:54.498 --> 48:55.829
What are you doing here?

48:57.601 --> 49:00.934
These men that worked with Edgar,
Americans...

49:01.104 --> 49:04.562
...they came looking for you.
They killed my grandfather.

49:05.042 --> 49:08.136
- Man, oh, man.
- I know every trail, road and canyon...

49:08.312 --> 49:09.939
...for a hundred miles.

49:23.393 --> 49:25.088
We're gonna need guns.

49:34.571 --> 49:35.697
Leo, get in the back.

49:39.009 --> 49:41.136
Stop here. We're close.

49:52.656 --> 49:55.022
It used to be a weapons depot
for the military.

49:55.192 --> 49:56.318
Now Verdugo uses it.

49:56.493 --> 49:59.257
- He's gonna kill us anyway.
- How are we gonna get in there?

49:59.429 --> 50:03.160
They gotta have some sort of, like,
security system, or fancy locks--

50:03.333 --> 50:07.064
No. Don't worry about it.
You take care of the guards, I'll get you in.

50:22.119 --> 50:23.552
Señor.

50:47.844 --> 50:49.869
Don't know why we don't just shoot
the lock.

50:50.047 --> 50:52.311
It's gonna be a lot faster
if I just shoot it off.

50:52.482 --> 50:55.110
Yeah. If the gunshot
doesn't bring the whole town down...

50:55.285 --> 50:57.219
...your big mouth is going to. Shut up.

50:59.089 --> 51:01.114
Hey, guys,
you mind giving me some room?

51:01.291 --> 51:03.782
- Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:04.761 --> 51:07.525
- Where did you learn that?
- I met a guy when I was a kid.

51:07.697 --> 51:08.925
We called him Uncle Jimmy.

51:09.499 --> 51:11.364
He's the best B & E man in the country.

51:12.536 --> 51:15.699
He taught me
how to get in and out of anything.

51:31.521 --> 51:33.318
Hey, guys, come in.

51:33.490 --> 51:34.752
Oh, my God.

51:34.925 --> 51:38.588
This must be what Charlton Heston's
first wet dream looked like.

51:38.762 --> 51:41.925
This will definitely do.

51:42.566 --> 51:45.194
Someone is gonna have to show me
how to use one of these.

51:45.368 --> 51:48.804
You know what, kid?
I have absolutely no idea.

51:48.972 --> 51:51.600
But I bet big bad Sammy the cop
will show you.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.606
No, sir, only the bad guys get these.

51:53.777 --> 51:56.302
Grab a high-powered automatic rifle,
some grenades.

51:56.480 --> 51:59.005
Leo, don't blow yourself up.

52:08.925 --> 52:10.517
How do you feel, boss?

52:12.863 --> 52:14.296
Sorry.

52:14.898 --> 52:15.990
Well.

52:16.166 --> 52:19.431
Well, listen to you.

52:19.669 --> 52:22.832
I do believe that apology is sincere.

52:23.006 --> 52:25.497
I mean, there's nothing
like a peek at mortality...

52:25.675 --> 52:27.836
...to sharpen hindsight, huh?

52:31.281 --> 52:33.681
My life has been about money.

52:36.119 --> 52:38.246
I have trouble seeing past it.

52:38.421 --> 52:39.683
Don't tell me.

52:39.856 --> 52:44.725
And now you're wondering
if money is what life is all about, huh?

52:47.931 --> 52:50.161
That's clichéd, man.

52:51.401 --> 52:52.891
But I'm with you.

52:53.937 --> 52:55.837
Because that is the question.

52:56.473 --> 52:58.668
Is the money enough?

53:01.845 --> 53:04.814
I mean, is anything less
than blowing your head off enough?

53:06.316 --> 53:09.012
Because that's the thing
about blowing somebody's head off.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.848
Oh, boy, it is definitely enough.

53:16.960 --> 53:21.056
If you're gonna kill me,
could I say goodbye to my family first?

53:21.231 --> 53:23.699
What? Tell them you love them,
that sort of nonsense?

53:27.037 --> 53:29.505
Yes. Please.

53:30.006 --> 53:31.030
Wow, that is touching.

53:32.976 --> 53:34.000
Yes.

53:38.815 --> 53:40.043
Relax, will you?

53:41.184 --> 53:43.709
I couldn't even figure out how to load it.

53:43.887 --> 53:46.583
I'm not really a gun kind of guy.

53:56.499 --> 53:58.763
Only one road takes us close
to the canyons...

53:58.935 --> 54:02.063
...and they'll see us coming for miles.
We'll need horses.

54:02.239 --> 54:05.731
Wait-- No, no. Horses?
No, I don't do horses, guys. Okay?

54:06.243 --> 54:07.574
You any good on a horse, kid?

54:07.744 --> 54:10.770
Yeah. I spent a few years
on a work ranch for delinquents.

54:10.947 --> 54:12.847
Heigh-ho, Silver.

54:13.016 --> 54:16.315
The Mennonites have the best horses.
Supplies, clothing also.

54:16.720 --> 54:17.778
Mennonites?

54:17.954 --> 54:20.218
My ass hurts already.

54:31.568 --> 54:32.592
Over here.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.168
Sir?

54:36.106 --> 54:38.301
I'm gonna need a real gentle one.

54:38.475 --> 54:39.942
Like--

54:40.377 --> 54:41.901
I'd like to smell the glue.

54:43.079 --> 54:45.479
- Okay.
- The roan is beautiful.

54:45.649 --> 54:48.015
An excellent choice. You know horses.

54:48.184 --> 54:51.483
You got one
where my feet can still touch the ground?

54:57.727 --> 54:59.126
She won't take a saddle.

55:02.399 --> 55:04.959
- Yeah. She's been abused.
- Abused?

55:05.702 --> 55:06.930
No.

55:07.103 --> 55:09.094
Some require a firm hand.

55:12.842 --> 55:14.639
Yeah, she's been burnt by the hobbles.

55:18.014 --> 55:19.845
Her ribs are bruised.

55:20.016 --> 55:22.712
Whipped pretty hard on the backside,
and maybe kicked even.

55:23.920 --> 55:27.788
- Is that your idea of a firm hand?
- This horse almost killed a man once.

55:28.258 --> 55:29.987
I don't doubt that.

55:31.695 --> 55:32.889
Maybe you can do better.

55:33.063 --> 55:34.257
Yeah.

55:34.431 --> 55:37.332
Well, you don't deserve this horse
or any other. We'll take it.

55:38.668 --> 55:40.693
Come here. You stay there.

55:42.706 --> 55:45.539
Yeah. Yeah.

55:47.744 --> 55:48.836
Listen, I got it.

55:49.012 --> 55:52.004
I'll let you take care of that, Sam.
Go right ahead.

55:58.455 --> 56:00.047
That's my brother, you know.

56:02.525 --> 56:07.553
- You don't seem like brothers.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

56:09.232 --> 56:11.723
He's pretty good with that horse, though,
ain't he?

56:11.901 --> 56:14.426
I've seen that kind of training before.

56:14.604 --> 56:16.435
Very gentle.

56:17.307 --> 56:18.365
Thattagirl.

56:19.142 --> 56:20.871
Are you a policeman too?

56:21.044 --> 56:22.170
No.

56:22.345 --> 56:23.573
No, no, no.

56:23.747 --> 56:26.682
Not me. Just Sam.

56:28.351 --> 56:30.319
Is he a good one?

56:31.888 --> 56:33.617
I'm sure he is.

56:34.324 --> 56:36.690
He's good at everything he does.

56:37.660 --> 56:39.457
Except people.

56:47.003 --> 56:49.096
Sorry about your grandfather.

57:04.587 --> 57:06.748
What do you think of Little Joe now,
huh?

57:13.229 --> 57:15.390
The kidnappers gotta be talking
to the FBI.

57:15.565 --> 57:18.125
There's no phone lines,
no cell phones to trace.

57:18.301 --> 57:21.896
Unless scrambled through a computer.
Wireless phone modems and cell phone.

57:22.071 --> 57:24.562
- E-mails.
- Hold up. Hold up.

57:24.741 --> 57:27.574
They're gonna need a generator.
Generators powered by gas.

57:28.244 --> 57:30.678
Only one gas depot
between here and the canyons.

57:30.847 --> 57:33.008
- Can you find it?
- I'm Indian, remember?

57:33.183 --> 57:34.514
Like your cowboy movies.

57:34.684 --> 57:38.313
I get down, put my ear to the ground,
smell the horse dung, sniff the wind.

57:38.488 --> 57:40.012
That's all we're good for, right?

57:42.258 --> 57:45.955
What's wrong with Hiawatha?
Wake up on the wrong side of the bedroll?

57:46.463 --> 57:50.024
Considering what she's been through,
maybe we could cut her some slack, huh?

57:50.333 --> 57:52.358
Come on. Come on.

57:52.535 --> 57:56.972
Yeah, I guess Little Joe is right.
That was kind of stupid.

57:57.140 --> 57:59.506
You know what's stupid?
The whole Bonanza thing.

57:59.676 --> 58:01.075
That's stupid.

58:03.947 --> 58:07.474
You must have cared about him once.
A long time ago.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.312
Edgar was like my father.

58:10.487 --> 58:14.446
He protected me from the things
he knew I would not tolerate.

58:14.924 --> 58:16.050
You mean he lied to you?

58:16.359 --> 58:18.293
That's what I mean.

58:19.128 --> 58:22.222
When I found out the true nature
of what he did, I left.

58:22.398 --> 58:23.626
Again, like my father.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.859
What is it that your father did?

58:27.036 --> 58:29.004
Verdugo worked for him.

58:29.172 --> 58:30.605
Hey!

58:31.241 --> 58:34.904
How do you get these things to go
if they don't want to?

58:35.578 --> 58:39.036
The gas depot is over the next rise.
About a mile.

58:39.215 --> 58:41.809
All right, we'll rest near here
and we wait for dark.

58:53.630 --> 58:55.689
That is one gorgeous woman, ain't it?

58:56.332 --> 58:58.061
Definitely.

58:59.802 --> 59:04.034
Hey, tell me, little brother,
how do you do it, huh?

59:04.207 --> 59:05.765
With the ladies, I mean.

59:07.377 --> 59:11.336
I'm not asking
because I need pointers or anything...

59:11.514 --> 59:14.950
...but good Lord knows
that I do just fine on my own but--

59:15.118 --> 59:18.281
I'm just asking artist to artist, like....

59:19.022 --> 59:20.353
What's your technique?

59:20.723 --> 59:23.851
Well, Leo, I really don't like to talk
about stuff like that.

59:24.027 --> 59:26.086
It kind of kills the magic.

59:28.565 --> 59:32.126
Wow,
I wasn't meaning locker room B.S.

59:32.302 --> 59:34.361
I was trying to bond, brother to brother.

59:35.738 --> 59:36.932
Apparently, never mind.

59:40.610 --> 59:42.271
All right, well....

59:42.445 --> 59:44.845
- You wanna know what the thing is?
- Yeah.

59:45.014 --> 59:48.006
The way I get my joy, my satisfaction...

59:48.318 --> 59:51.617
...is how intense and complete
the woman's joy is.

59:51.955 --> 59:54.583
If the woman seems very giving...

59:54.757 --> 59:59.126
...it's because I'm acutely attuned
into her every need.

59:59.996 --> 01:00:01.588
But in reality...

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.128
...it's selfishly motivated.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.240
I guess that could work.

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:31.284
Leo, stay here with Theresa.
Me and the kid are gonna look around.

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:34.191
Wait. Why do I have to stay here?

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:36.998
- She'll protect you.
- Oh, come on.

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:40.795
- I'm the one that speaks Spanish.
- Not gonna talk to them, just look around.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.200
Hey, go, Leo, I could stay with Theresa.

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:46.399
- I think we all know where that's going.
- Don't be an idiot, Leo.

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.840
Listen to the kid.
Starting to sound like family.

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:50.070
We could all go.

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:53.374
No. I'm gonna go alone.
Less of a change I can get spotted.

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.949
No offense, Sam,
but you're pretty easy to spot.

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.518
I don't want you getting shot.

01:00:57.687 --> 01:01:01.145
And that neon cowboy hat on your fat head
isn't helping either.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.622
- What, you're worried about me, Leo?
- No.

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:06.489
I just don't the shot
giving away our position.

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:57.542
Well, if you'll excuse me.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:01.445
I think this might be a good time for me
to freshen up.

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:07.122
Be careful
because human feces is an aphrodisiac...

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.282
...for the great brown Mexican grizzly.

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.619
Thanks for the tip.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.641
He doesn't have the arrogance
of most men I've known.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.377
Well...

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.439
...he can be pretty selfish.

01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:34.378
You know, he's just a kid, remember?

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:42.180
Your brother, Sam?
He seems hardened.

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.382
Yeah.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.925
Yeah. It's because he is.

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:49.924
Hard-nosed, hardheaded...

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:51.830
...hard to get along with.

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:54.765
But you, you are none of those things?

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:57.735
Hardened, selfish? Nothing like that?

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.233
No. No, it's because I'm a giver.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:03.737
Give, give, give, always give,
never take.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.005
You seem very insecure.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:10.241
What?
Where did you pick that up, huh?

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:13.252
Some psych class at the local Jaycee
or is that all Dr. Phil?

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:14.988
Who is Dr. Phil?

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:19.751
You need a satellite
to get Dr. Phil out here.

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:24.455
No, no, no. Hey, it's okay.
Look, it's okay, all right? Just relax.

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.769
- Your friends, where they at?
- Yeah?

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.268
What friends?

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:34.973
The ones riding the other horses.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.702
I'm a cowboy.

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:40.874
Those are my horses.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:43.951
I ride one son of a bitch to death
and then I got a backup.

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:49.152
Tell me or Bernardo
is going to have to cut your girlfriend.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.150
No, no, no. I'm taking her to Verdugo.

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.319
If you hurt her, he'll kill all of us.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.897
Verdugo is the one that sent us.

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.469
Last chance.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:04.333
I mean, if I kill her,
she can't have my kids.

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:06.966
No, no, no, okay.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.538
Okay.

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:11.475
I gave it my best shot.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.839
Wait, I'll be honest now, okay?

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.751
One of my friends
is right behind your partner.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.486
Theresa, you okay?

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.719
Leo. Leo, you all right?

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.257
I lost a tooth.

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:31.695
I definitely broke a rib.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:34.029
And my ass really hurts
from that damn horse.

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:36.569
But you were cool, man.
You were definitely cool.

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:37.999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.539
- You think so.
- Yeah.

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.772
- You were cool too, brother.
- Who the hell are these guys?

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:45.140
You should've seen Leo.
He wouldn't give us up.

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.248
- No.
- Verdugo sent them.

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:51.580
I bet there's more after them. Listen,
I saw a map, a town called Platzcurro?

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:53.221
I got the coordinates.

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:57.223
Patzcurro is half a day's ride
on horseback. Maybe an hour by truck.

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:59.861
Then we go now.
Listen, you keep my horse with you.

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.758
If that truck is leaving, I'm on it.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.695
What if we run into where they keep
Wills? They'll kill him.

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:08.769
The money, only way they get it
is if they keep him alive. They'll kill us first.

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:13.375
- What if they think we're the FBI?
- The FBI won't come in on horseback.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:17.376
That's a good point. All right,
so we stick to the plan. We find Wills.

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:22.381
We call the American Embassy,
go home, and wait for our check.

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:26.586
Is that all this is about for you?
The money?

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:30.789
I didn't mean it like-- As long as
we're here, the money is not a bad thing.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.120
We should get ready.

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:34.820
I didn't mean it like that, Theresa.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.596
Come on. You meant well.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.734
I had a dream last night...

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:45.931
...the guys who killed Rodriguez,
whoever they are...

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.634
...were just a myth

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.442
Yeah.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:58.144
I dreamed you orchestrated the thing,
so we wouldn't have to split the money.

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:02.079
I'm not that clever.

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.692
Don't underestimate yourself.

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.000
Not much.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.306
You understand you habla too much,
I kill you?

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:57.810
Good.

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:12.290
Rise and shine, pumpkin head.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.592
That's what my mother used to say.

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:18.564
If all goes as planned, you should be back
with your pseudo loved ones...

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.258
...by happy hour tomorrow night.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:22.768
At which point,
I will be halfway to handsome.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:25.031
Before you do
whatever it is you've planned...

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.437
...will I be able to talk to my son?

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.711
You're sure we're gonna kill you, huh?

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:32.670
- Crossed my mind.
- Well, you're wrong...

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:37.410
...again. You took 50 million from me,
I take 500 million from you.

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:40.851
Which I would've had
if I invested the 50 mil in the first place.

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:43.253
Swear to God. It's an eye for an eye.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:44.890
Biblical, man.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:51.898
- Move in right now!
- Don't let it go!

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:05.674
- No.
- No, no, no.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:08.811
To relax.

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.354
Hello.

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:20.154
I'd like to speak to the agent in charge
of the Lyle Wills kidnapping investigation.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:24.960
Yes, I think I can be of help.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:27.665
Thank you.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.008
- You said a few minutes, goddamn it.
- It's only been a few minutes.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:44.475
What's the matter?
Is the Iceman having a meltdown?

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:51.749
Got it. I got it, baby.
I'm all set up for the transfer.

01:08:51.926 --> 01:08:54.622
Now, we just gotta put our buddy here
online...

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:58.863
...and the party gets started.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.795
Get out of the way.
Move out of the way. Here we go.

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:08.175
I think Sam just pulled up
with the gas truck.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.876
Just look for the guy
with the dorky cowboy hat...

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:14.174
...and with the King Kong shoulders.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.874
- See him.
- Yup.

01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:37.867
Strato Entertainment,
down four and an eighth.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.169
CoreCell, down a half.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:44.042
SoloNET, down two and change.

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:48.444
Can you back the hell off please?
I can't even hear myself think here.

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:54.479
Janson.

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:56.049
Yeah, Dad?

01:09:57.259 --> 01:10:01.320
I wanted to tell you what I do for a living.
For your report.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:04.262
I turned it in, Dad.

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:05.661
I made some stuff up.

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:08.763
I'm sorry.

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:11.839
But I'd still like to know.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.232
Got it.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.342
Here we go.

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:18.071
All we gotta do is split it up
and we're out of here.

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:51.243
You're insane, Sam.

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:52.778
My God, what just happened?

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:53.972
What was that?

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:56.513
Get out of the way! Get out there!

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:59.386
We split up.
Make them think that there's more of us.

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:01.952
Where--?
My husband, what happened to him?

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:05.417
Jeez, it's not us.

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:07.619
We're headed there now.

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:10.128
The Black Hawks
the Mexican military promised us...

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.790
...are both down
with mechanical problems so....

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:16.228
Commercial helicopters are at least
two hours out from Mexico City.

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:18.032
Copy that.

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:22.509
It all starts with an idea, right?

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:25.238
These people come up with ideas.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:28.239
Good people, good ideas.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.941
That's how you start a business.

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:49.996
Anybody see anything?

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:53.700
I can see the future. You're not in it.

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.542
Drop it.

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:58.303
Where's Wills?

01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.604
Dead.

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:01.273
You're late.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:03.577
If he was dead,
you would've moved on by now.

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:09.054
The one with Sam
killed my grandfather.

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:25.038
You must be the guy
that killed Rodriguez.

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.505
You picked the wrong horse, bubba.

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.845
Kill them both.

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:20.559
Got it. Done.

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.925
- That's what my company does.
- Done.

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:25.760
You make it sound like charity work,
you puke.

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:27.697
- Janson--
- Hey, look, kid.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.895
Then your old man fires all the people...

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:33.198
...then brings in teams of lawyers
and private investigators...

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:34.706
... to ruin everybody's lives.

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:37.710
Trust me,
I know from firsthand experience.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.441
- That's what your old man does.
- We have to go now!

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:45.050
- Janson, l--
- Do you do that, Dad?

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:50.782
Yes. Yes.

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:55.093
That's what I do.

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.443
Go, go, go!

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:26.586
Theresa and Leo check the grounds.
I go after the Bronco.

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.889
- Through the mountains.
- Bronco doesn't matter.

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:31.828
It matters to Theresa.
That guy killed her grandfather.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.300
Just don't get hurt.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:44.771
Hey....

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:52.052
What?

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.496
Verdugo.

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:14.733
Crap.

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.104
Señor Wills?

01:15:57.519 --> 01:15:59.578
This. This is unacceptable.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:01.688
Are you with the FBI?

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:06.390
No, no. I'm here to escort you to them.

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.058
You are safe now.

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:11.692
You are in safe hands.

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:26.881
All right, before they beat you,
I know you had it in you, okay?

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.108
Now, you show me. Come on! Let's go!

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.607
Hey.

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:14.649
- Lost a lot of blood there, Little Joe.
- You okay, kid?

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:17.257
Hey, Sam.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.422
You find Wills?

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:27.465
Verdugo came and turned him over
to the FBI like a good Samaritan.

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.705
Okay, so, what does that mean for us?

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:31.930
It means we're broke.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.603
I got to admit, though.

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:39.236
Seeing that asshole tits up,
that was worth a million bucks, right?

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:45.117
Unfortunately, it doesn't bring
my grandfather back, does it?

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:58.560
I can't-- I just can't catch a break
with this broad, can l?

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:02.060
Try keeping your mouth shut.

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:18.715
Hey, hey. Wait! Wait!

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:20.047
Wait a minute.

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:23.920
I didn't come all this way
to die of exhaustion, okay?

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:27.260
Give me five minutes, okay?

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:36.167
Well, I guess
this is as good a place as any.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:43.741
Hey, get out of my stuff.

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:46.510
- Sit down!
- What? Hey!

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:49.946
What are you doing? What--?
Oh, come on, guys.

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.909
Put those down. Come on.

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:55.616
Is this the backup?

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.051
The backup flash drive, this is?

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:02.162
That's it. That's all we need.
Come on. Let's get going.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.264
I don't have to-- I don't have to sit.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.531
Hey, what are you, insane?
What's the matter--?

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:10.534
- Sit down, you pathetic--
- Wait, wait.

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:12.497
- Okay.
- You were right.

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:16.132
- Oh, wait.
- I underestimated myself.

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:19.139
Oh, come on.

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:20.947
Why didn't I see this?

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:22.515
Stop talking.

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.843
Please tell my mother--

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:29.985
That's them.

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:34.488
I saw them meet-up at the canyon.
It was just too dark to bring them down.

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:37.222
Only an Indian
could guide them through.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.227
They must have some plan of getting
picked up or transported from there.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.400
Unless we can get him before sunrise.

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:48.065
We have maybe four hours before dawn.
After that, they're gone.

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:49.267
No, what? What?

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.605
What are you guys talking about?

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:57.308
No, no, no. The guy that killed
your grandfather is already dead, okay?

01:20:57.485 --> 01:21:01.285
We're-- I'm not gonna get my money back.
We have no shot at the reward money.

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:05.324
Wills is back with his family.
Our job is done here.

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:09.721
Do you see anybody else out here
that's gonna go after him, Leo?

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:12.066
What's that got to do with anything,
Sam?

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:16.193
- I'm a cop. I don't get to walk away.
- You're not a cop. You got suspended.

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:18.532
I'm not asking you to go.
Stay with the kid.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.902
- Fine.
- I told you I'm fine. I can go.

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:24.178
Oh, that's just great.
Now, you're gonna get the kid killed too.

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:27.281
You know, just when I was starting
to like your dumb ass.

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:30.009
No, I'm not letting you take him
with you.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:33.348
His leg, it's about to fall off.
What are you gonna do? Carry him?

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:35.785
- Jeez, Leo, shut up!
- No, I won't shut up!

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:38.118
It's crazy, Sam!

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:42.495
- You know what, Sam?
- What?

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:47.533
It baffles me that you're not capable
of walking away from being a cop...

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:50.569
...yet you're completely fine
with walking out on me...

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.604
...and your little sister.

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:59.906
- So that's what this is all about, Leo?
- You left us alone with him.

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:05.613
You have absolutely no idea
how bad it got when you were gone.

01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:09.814
Now, now, Nina, you know her.
She probably forgave you by now...

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.549
...but me?

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:18.288
You were the one
that was taking care of us, not him!

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.828
I expected nothing from him, but you?

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:28.435
You know the funny thing?

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:32.477
Eventually, he sobered up.

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:38.677
You never came back, Sam.

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:42.946
It's crazy how much you resent the guy
because...

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.657
...you're just like him, Sam!

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:48.455
Hey!

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.154
Come on.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.634
I got you last!

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.169
What are you gonna do, huh? Do it!

01:22:57.339 --> 01:22:59.068
Do it!

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.941
Come on!

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.979
I was 17 years old.

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.547
If I'd have stayed, I'd have killed him.

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:18.525
Sorry.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.448
Marcus Canton.

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:53.150
We're going to have to move faster.

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:56.959
- How's the leg, kid?
- It's good enough.

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:14.709
It will be difficult for the horses
the rest of the way in the canyons.

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:18.341
- You think they're looking for him?
- I don't know. It's not military.

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.350
Maybe that's his way out.

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:25.220
Head down in case he doubles back.

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:28.055
They won't be able to land
at the bottom of the canyons.

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:30.288
- They're gonna pull him out.
- Right.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:57.776
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.338
Morning.

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:27.077
What brings you
to this neck of the woods?

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.145
You're under arrest.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:47.032
Never walk out on family, Sam.

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:51.168
You're absolutely right.

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:57.677
Nice going. What is it? Horse?

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.570
No, it's Hoss.

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:04.206
- And I'm not Hoss.
- I can't be Hoss, I'm the oldest.

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.683
By process of elimination, you're Hoss.

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:12.588
Fine, if only by process of elimination,
then I can live with that.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.300
- Are you sure there's nothing we can do?
- Yeah, I mean, the FBI...

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:31.934
...they said that we're good
for at least $250,000 of the reward money.

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:34.843
And in my opinion,
I think you more than earned your share.

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:37.246
That's 25 percent.

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:39.943
I mean, I'm assuming
that's okay with you guys.

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:41.281
- Absolutely.
- Seems fair.

01:27:41.456 --> 01:27:42.753
- Yeah.
- No, please, I'm fine.

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:44.991
Come on.

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:47.894
All right, come here.

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:49.994
- Careful.
- Thank you.

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:52.598
I'm sorry,
I know it's been a couple of days.

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:54.325
All right, take care.

01:27:54.502 --> 01:27:56.766
- Thank you.
- Get her, cowboy.

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:58.337
Take care.

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:01.669
I'll miss you.

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:07.179
I'd like to come back to visit
if that's okay.

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:11.045
Leo is gonna lend me his Spanish tapes,
he says.

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:13.483
I think I'd like that very much.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:16.480
Take care.

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:18.983
Bye.

01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:38.141
Oh, it was amazing. And this guy,
he's probably going back there.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.747
- Shut up.
- There was a special girl I might go see.

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:42.849
I can't believe we made it through alive.

01:28:43.017 --> 01:28:45.349
- Without him, I don't think we would have.
- Yeah.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.715
I wasn't there but you were--
You, walking in...

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:50.119
- ...and you noticed the cliff.
- Yeah.

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:52.452
Let's go, let's go.
You're going down there.

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:54.219
Yeah.

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:57.529
I wish you could've seen him.

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.963
You gotta give me those tapes.

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:05.899
There is no money.

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.370
There never was.

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:16.449
It was the only way
to bring you all together.

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.554
Daddy really was a changed man.

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:25.620
It was his final wish
to bring you all together.

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:27.317
That much was true.

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:34.896
There was no other way. I'm sorry.

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:36.864
You lied?

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:40.371
You never told a lie in your entire life.

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:44.770
I mean, me, I lie all the time, and Sam...

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:46.703
...he's a huge liar.

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:49.850
Then Douglas, the kid's a thief.
But you?

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.847
I believed you, Nina.

01:29:52.019 --> 01:29:54.920
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will go to confession.

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:59.253
Oh, yeah. "Okay, I'll go to confession.
It's all fine now." Are you kidding me?

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:02.362
- What are you gonna do about us?
- Leo, I'm sorry you're angry.

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.631
But the real question is...

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:09.032
...does the end justify the means?

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.299
I mean, look at you all.

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:25.208
What about
a private investigation agency?

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:28.154
I don't follow.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:32.755
I'm a cop. Leo, bail bondsman.
We know criminals.

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:35.555
- The kid is a criminal.
- No. Absolutely not.

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:38.324
No, I'm not bringing you together
so you can get killed.

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.558
Wait a second.
Are you actually suggesting...

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:42.999
...that we still go into business together
anyway?

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:46.106
If you're gonna do something,
you might as well be good at it.

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:47.298
Yeah, I like it.

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:48.601
-No.
-I'm in.

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:51.939
- That is not what Daddy wanted.
- The old man wanted us together.

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:55.640
Hope that sorry son of a bitch
is rolling over in his grave right now.

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:57.944
We got him last.

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:12.997
- Marker.
- Molly, Molly, Molly.

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.359
Grow up.

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:17.968
Kiss my ****, Sam.

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:20.231
- Kid.
- My bad.

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:21.773
It's all right.

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:25.504
For some reason,
he was really scary-looking that time.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.714
That way,
you can read real-time stock quotes...

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:31.408
...and see how far
your company's gone in the toilet...

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:34.487
...because their leader
is about to die a horrible death.

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:37.488
Sorry, don't have my glasses on.

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:39.287
****, close your eyes.

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:44.262
F-bomb. What the fudge and mustard?

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:51.101
You don't seem like brothers.

01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:53.569
You ever seen Wild at Heart?

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:58.703
The two Black Hawks promised us
are both down with mechanical problems.

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:02.148
You got egg on your face.

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:04.307
- And cut it.
- I always--

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:09.218
It seems that my Rodriguez guy
is involved with that Kyle Wills--

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:12.518
- It seems that that--
- Now you have egg on your face.

01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:15.826
We're gonna need some money
to get started.

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.533
How do you look in heels?

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.902
You, me, a faraway getaway place...

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:27.097
...some deli meats and a gallon of brandy.
That's fine with me.

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:31.042
Sam.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.840
Oh, my God,
he can't hold a straight face over here.

01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:41.552
Did wholesome Amy Smart
just say what I think she said?

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:43.917
Yeah, I did. I said, ****.

01:32:44.091 --> 01:32:45.752
And cut it.

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:52.263
Okay, trust me, trust me. I was a--
Trust me. Son of a *****.

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:54.560
- Why am I having--?
- Don't trust him.

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:57.602
Don't trust him. Don't trust him.

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.298
John, I gotta save my voice a little bit.

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:01.839
Do it. That's okay. No, no.

01:33:02.009 --> 01:33:05.445
I just like having you there
because you're fun to be with.

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.662
- It's for the gag reel.
- Yeah.

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:26.094
Just for the gag reel.

01:33:31.172 --> 01:33:32.400
Come on.

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:34.768
- Spit it out, woman!
- Cut. Great, cut.

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:53.621
I know every trail, road and canyon
for a hundred miles.

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:58.095
We're gonna need guns.
