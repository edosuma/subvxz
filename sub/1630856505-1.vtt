00:48.700 --> 00:49.788
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:25.911 --> 01:26.999
<i>What is an adult?</i>

01:28.349 --> 01:30.351
<i>Becomin' one
didn't suddenly transform me</i>

01:30.438 --> 01:33.876
<i>into anything outstanding
or significant.</i>

01:33.963 --> 01:36.313
<i>I am 18 and
entirely unremarkable.</i>

01:38.620 --> 01:39.882
<i>Languishing in the wilds</i>

01:39.969 --> 01:41.797
<i>of nowhere, Tennessee.</i>

01:41.884 --> 01:43.320
<i>In this tomb of a house
left to me</i>

01:43.407 --> 01:45.496
<i>by my brilliant
and selfish parents.</i>

01:46.541 --> 01:48.195
<i>They're not dead...</i>

01:48.282 --> 01:49.718
<i>though they pretend I am.</i>

01:50.719 --> 01:52.329
<i>They're permanently abroad.</i>

01:53.765 --> 01:57.160
<i>Literature is my solace
in the solitude.</i>

01:57.247 --> 01:59.206
<i>And writing is my only means
of escape.</i>

02:00.076 --> 02:02.557
<i>Because, you see...</i>

02:02.644 --> 02:04.646
<i>I've never left the edges
of this town.</i>

02:05.690 --> 02:07.736
<i>It's positively gothic,
really.</i>

02:09.651 --> 02:11.174
<i>Lonely girl longs to escape</i>

02:11.261 --> 02:14.525
<i>the interminable boredom
of her small village.</i>

02:14.612 --> 02:16.614
<i>Lonely girl longs
to be meaningful.</i>

02:17.702 --> 02:20.749
<i>Lonely girl longs to be loved.</i>

02:20.836 --> 02:23.491
<i>Books make longing
seem romantic, but it's awful.</i>

02:24.100 --> 02:25.710
<i>It's greedy.</i>

02:25.797 --> 02:28.235
<i>And I wear longing
like a fucking veil.</i>

02:45.817 --> 02:47.471
<i>But today?</i>

02:47.558 --> 02:49.778
<i>Today comes with
something new.</i>

02:49.865 --> 02:51.171
<i>Something surprising.</i>

02:52.911 --> 02:55.392
<i>Today I meet a writer,
like me.</i>

02:56.654 --> 02:58.743
<i>A teacher.</i>

02:58.830 --> 03:00.310
<i>One who somehow
found inspiration</i>

03:00.397 --> 03:01.833
<i>in a place like this.</i>

03:03.008 --> 03:04.140
<i>If you can believe it.</i>

03:11.060 --> 03:12.801
<i>Well...</i>

03:12.888 --> 03:15.238
<i>I suppose even graveyards
grow flowers.</i>

03:46.008 --> 03:47.052
Good morning.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.316
Morning.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.972
You know, class doesn't start
for another hour.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.192
I know. I don't like crowds.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.280
Uh-uh...

03:58.803 --> 04:01.153
- Do you live far?
- Close enough to walk.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.981
- Oh, where's that?
- Lovell Hill?

04:03.068 --> 04:04.896
You live in Lovell Hill?

04:04.983 --> 04:06.768
- You know it?
- I just didn't think it was

04:06.855 --> 04:09.161
occupied by anything
except ghosts.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.337
- Who says it is?

04:11.729 --> 04:13.427
You, you
really live in Lovell Hill?

04:13.514 --> 04:14.515
Wow.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.431
It's enormous.

04:17.518 --> 04:18.954
My parents are lawyers.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.738
- Hmm, what kind?
- The expensive kind.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.262
And you wanna be a lawyer?

04:22.349 --> 04:24.176
About as much as I wanna be
a high school student.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.482
What's your name?

04:25.569 --> 04:26.918
Cairo Sweet.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.094
- I'm Mr. Miller.
- I know.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.227
My friend Winnie
recommended your class.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.315
Uh-huh.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.099
Uh...

04:34.186 --> 04:36.537
Now I'm assuming that you got
one of these before...

04:37.233 --> 04:38.365
the holidays.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.757
Got a chance to look it over?

04:39.844 --> 04:40.976
I read it.

04:41.063 --> 04:42.499
I, I,
I know it looks like a lot,

04:42.586 --> 04:43.718
but I promise you
we'll get through it

04:43.805 --> 04:45.241
as quickly as we can.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.373
I read the whole list.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.462
Wait, you read these?

04:50.246 --> 04:52.335
Well, like,
there's 12 books on that list.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.467
I party hard.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.732
- Winnie.
Mm. Hmm, hmm.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.429
One semester
wasn't enough for you?

04:59.516 --> 05:00.604
Did you miss me?

05:00.691 --> 05:01.953
I did not.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.391
Well, that's too bad.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.526
You're overdressed as usual,
I see.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.789
Your underwear,
as usual, I see.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.536
How boring.

05:19.623 --> 05:20.929
Censorship is dead.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.539
It can't exist
with the Internet.

05:22.626 --> 05:23.714
And yet it does.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.063
Do you know why?

05:25.150 --> 05:26.151
Yeah.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.328
- Do you?

05:28.415 --> 05:30.025
Ignorance is a product
of laziness.

05:31.243 --> 05:32.767
- Not limitation.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.203
Oh.
Excuse me,

05:34.290 --> 05:35.726
but what's that you say?

05:35.813 --> 05:39.774
You want
a chicken biscuit

05:40.557 --> 05:42.385
and a Coke?

05:42.472 --> 05:45.170
Mm. Well, you heard the boss.

05:45.257 --> 05:48.391
It's chickybikky Coke-y time,
let's go.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.088
You want anything, Mr. Miller?

05:51.002 --> 05:52.569
No, thank you, Cairo.

05:52.656 --> 05:53.788
Sweet of you to ask.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.660
I see
what you did there.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.575
"Cairo, sweet of you to ask."

05:58.662 --> 05:59.663
Not.

06:00.316 --> 06:01.404
Good one.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.624
Like we've never heard
that before.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.072
Jesus.

06:24.601 --> 06:25.602
My God.

06:34.698 --> 06:35.699
What you reading?

06:36.918 --> 06:39.007
- Uh, nothing.
- Doesn't look like nothin'.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.095
It's a student's.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.226
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

06:41.313 --> 06:42.445
How do you know it's a girl?

06:42.532 --> 06:44.099
Oh, boys are too lazy
to read porn.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.274
How do you know it's porn?

06:47.363 --> 06:49.757
"Marcelle wants me
to fuck her.

06:49.844 --> 06:50.932
"She leaps off the couch

06:51.019 --> 06:52.020
-"and pushes herself..."
- Boris.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.413
"...between the girl and me.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.590
"It's all
so fantastically horrible

06:56.677 --> 06:58.026
-"that I can't move."
- Give me that.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.549
-"Marcelle stretches..."
- Okay.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.377
-"...her tiny split fig."
- That's quite enough...

07:01.464 --> 07:02.770
- All right.
- ...of your elocution...

07:02.857 --> 07:04.424
- And test tomorrow, kids.
- I think.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.034
Well, "Split fig"
is fucking poetry.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.427
- This coffee for me?
- Biscuit, too.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.299
One of yours?

07:10.386 --> 07:11.561
Oh, yeah,
that's one of yours.

07:11.648 --> 07:12.649
One of mine. Exactly.

07:12.736 --> 07:13.781
- Christ!

07:13.868 --> 07:15.217
I don't know what
you're doing,

07:15.304 --> 07:16.566
- but it's some...
- Oh, you know. Come on, now.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.046
I'm trying to just entice you.
What the...

07:18.133 --> 07:19.134
- Man, that's good.
-"Oh, I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>

07:19.221 --> 07:20.265
-"I'm so smart."
- Can you not?

07:20.352 --> 07:21.919
"Everybody,
I'm in high school.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.007
-"But I read <i>The Paris Review.
- </i>  Boris. Boris. Come on.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.182
"I'm better than most people."

07:24.269 --> 07:25.096
- Stop, please.
- Is this her diary?

07:25.183 --> 07:26.315
Oh, what do we have here?

07:26.402 --> 07:28.360
Well, well, well.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.320
<i>"Apostrophes
and Ampersands..."</i>

07:32.364 --> 07:35.933
six abysmally
romantic short stories

07:36.020 --> 07:38.458
by Jonathan Albert Miller.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.287
- She has my book?
Mm-hmm.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.680
It would appear so.
It would also appear

07:43.767 --> 07:45.073
she's the only one
who checked it out.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.379
Yeah, well, don't you have
a class to teach?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.685
Well, you know,

07:48.772 --> 07:49.947
I can't start my day
without seeing you.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.210
No, you really can't.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.256
Hey, how'd you score
the big room anyway?

07:54.343 --> 07:55.997
They cut
the theater program.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.477
But they kept you?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.217
Along with
the other props, yeah.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.003
- Damn.
- Mm-hmm.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.158
- Hello, wife.
- Hello, husband.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.034
Beatrice.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.036
- What?
- Look at me.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.695
Huh.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.348
Red-Letter Day.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.742
What, your school
finally get computers?

08:45.829 --> 08:46.874
Better.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.136
Indoor bathrooms?

08:48.223 --> 08:49.616
A writer.

08:49.703 --> 08:50.965
One who reads <i>Finnegans Wake</i>

08:51.052 --> 08:52.444
of her own volition.
Can you believe that?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.098
Well, I'm forever stunned
that the children

08:54.185 --> 08:56.274
in that backwater shanty
can read at all.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.233
And, uh, guess what else?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.669
<i>- Naked Lunch.</i>
- Mm-mm.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.715
<i>Apostrophes and Ampersands.</i>

09:01.802 --> 09:02.846
She...

09:02.933 --> 09:05.153
She checked it out
of the library.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.459
They carry your book
at the library?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.940
-  Aw. Fuck.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.814
<i>- A Confederacy of Dunces.
- </i>  Mm-hmm.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.685
Well, deep breaths.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.034
- Happy place.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.341
My happy place
has all their heads

09:19.428 --> 09:21.822
impaled on Montblanc pens.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.519
Share your riches.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.698
Hello, Amy.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.570
What? Are you fucking joking?

09:30.657 --> 09:32.180
I've been back and forth
all day

09:32.267 --> 09:34.138
with the Nashville office
who can't seem to articulate

09:34.225 --> 09:35.444
what it is they want

09:35.531 --> 09:37.359
and somehow think
they can articulate

09:37.446 --> 09:39.230
to me,
which is pretty ambitious

09:39.317 --> 09:40.362
considering how they think

09:40.449 --> 09:42.843
"articulate"
is a Danish cheese.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.585
So, I'm about to start
fucking scooping out

09:45.672 --> 09:47.238
my teeth with a baby spoon.

09:47.325 --> 09:48.936
Mm.
They can go

09:49.023 --> 09:51.634
fuck themselves if they think
I'm gonna change the ending.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.505
Okay, have a nice day,
bye-bye.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.618
- Here now.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.533
Cheers.

10:22.578 --> 10:23.623
Cheers.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.670
Oh, that's so good.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.327
Hey, you ever read, uh,

10:32.414 --> 10:34.590
<i>Under the Roofs of Paris,</i>
Henry Miller?

10:34.677 --> 10:36.940
Honey,
my first copy got so sticky,

10:37.027 --> 10:38.986
- I had to throw it away.

10:39.073 --> 10:41.031
That beginning bit
with the prostitute...

10:41.118 --> 10:42.642
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- ...and the cum money?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.339
That is choice.

10:44.426 --> 10:47.734
"I take the first
bill I find in my pocket

10:47.821 --> 10:50.519
-"and wipe my cock on it."

10:52.303 --> 10:55.089
"And place it crumpled
on her bare belly

10:56.133 --> 10:57.308
"weighted with a coin."

10:57.395 --> 10:59.702
- I love when you do magic.
- Mm.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.095
You care to reenact?

11:01.182 --> 11:02.966
I can papier-mache you...

11:04.620 --> 11:06.448
with cum and money.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.797
- Oh, so you're expecting

11:07.884 --> 11:10.104
- a heavy load, then, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.889
A full body of work.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.543
Come here.

11:15.631 --> 11:16.676
Dance with me.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.305
You're so beautiful.

11:37.827 --> 11:38.959
Shut up.

11:54.757 --> 11:57.238
Oh, for fuck's sake.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.153
- Okay.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.156
Will you take care
of those dishes?

12:02.243 --> 12:03.244
Uh-huh.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.115
I'll give you a handy later.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.120
It's Pushkin, Amy.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.643
Not Pollyfuckinanna.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.951
What
a terrible weekend.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.127
- Mm.
- Come on,

12:17.214 --> 12:19.347
why you always gotta
hold my coffee hostage?

12:19.434 --> 12:20.783
'Cause you're a puritan.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.045
I feel like it's my duty

12:22.132 --> 12:23.743
to punish the goodness
out of you.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.135
God, you're a sadist.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.571
I'm a public school teacher.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.095
- Amen to that.
- Cheers.

12:30.662 --> 12:31.707
Ooh, mama.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.669
You think there's ghosts
up in there?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.586
Why don't you go see?

12:41.673 --> 12:43.893
Mm-mm.
I don't go in the kudzu.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.982
That feeds on
the souls of the dead.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.288
That's why it grows so fast.

13:15.751 --> 13:16.883
Good morning.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.145
You always walk through
the woods alone?

13:18.232 --> 13:19.320
That's a peculiar question

13:19.407 --> 13:21.539
to ask a young lady,
Coach Fillmore.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.106
What, what are you,
uh, listening to?

13:23.193 --> 13:24.978
- Celine Dion.
- Really?

13:25.065 --> 13:26.457
- Really.

13:26.544 --> 13:27.894
But why?

13:27.981 --> 13:29.330
- I'm sorry.
- Because she's great.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.635
Oh. Hmm.
- Ignore him. Ignore him.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.724
- He wept aloud openly...
- Hmm.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.378
...at the <i>Titanic</i>
theme song...

13:34.465 --> 13:35.553
Hmm.
- ...at my bachelor party.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.338
- Remember that?
- I was drunk.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.513
You were disconsolate.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.862
You are a fucking traitor.

13:39.949 --> 13:40.994
And you're a fucking
hypocrite.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.212
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.648
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:43.735 --> 13:44.998
Uh, want a biscuit?

13:45.085 --> 13:46.521
- Yeah, sure.
- There you go.

13:53.876 --> 13:54.964
It's good.
Yeah?

13:55.051 --> 13:56.096
- Do you make these?
Yeah.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.619
But you know,
don't tell nobody.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.447
- Why not? I don't.
- Oh, you know.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.927
- You'll figure it out.
- I won't.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.363
You can't have
the baseball team knowing

14:02.450 --> 14:04.234
that he bakes biscuits
and cries to Celine Dion.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.107
On that...
Take my leave.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.370
I shall bid you goodbye.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.588
- Okay.
- Uh, you, bad bye.

14:10.675 --> 14:11.807
- Well, goodbye.
A bad bye?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.026
Mm-hmm.
- But I love you though.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.114
No, you don't.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.640
Don't you get scared walking
through those woods?

14:23.036 --> 14:24.602
I'm the scariest thing
in there.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.837
Oldest trick in the book,
Winnie.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.144
Ain't you gonna say somethin'?

14:45.406 --> 14:46.798
I dressed up just for you.

14:48.409 --> 14:49.932
What you want?

14:50.019 --> 14:51.020
I wanna get into

14:51.107 --> 14:53.109
- your physics class.
- Why?

14:53.196 --> 14:54.197
You'd be really behind.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.633
Don't you tutor?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.157
You don't need lessons.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.420
Then what do I need?

15:00.725 --> 15:02.162
Um...

15:05.513 --> 15:06.818
See what I can do.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.211
'Preciate ya!

15:08.298 --> 15:09.430
Hope so.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.259
You are insane.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.786
Here.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.049
I think
I'm seducing Coach Fillmore.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.183
But you're a lesbian.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.315
I'm an equal opportunist.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.969
Mm.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.579
Are you jealous?

15:28.666 --> 15:30.407
Well, if I say, "yes,"
will you lay off him?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.670
If I say, "yes,"
will you lay on me?

15:34.150 --> 15:35.456
Okay, chickybikky?

15:36.674 --> 15:38.328
Okay.

15:47.642 --> 15:48.904
So, you're a smoker now?

15:49.905 --> 15:51.776
I'm smoking now.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.214
No plans for it
to define me yet.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.693
Where are your parents
this time?

15:56.433 --> 15:57.478
Mumbai.

15:58.653 --> 15:59.697
For how long?

16:00.089 --> 16:01.569
Who knows?

16:01.656 --> 16:03.223
Let me dress you up.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.920
Winnie, you know I don't give
a fuck about being hot.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.269
I give a fuck
about being smart.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.271
You can be both.

16:10.404 --> 16:11.622
What are you doin'?

16:13.276 --> 16:14.799
I'm willing my cursor
to blink itself

16:14.886 --> 16:16.105
into my Yale essay.

16:16.714 --> 16:17.802
You dry?

16:19.108 --> 16:20.370
Unqualified.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.894
What's the subject?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.722
"What has been your greatest
achievement to date?"

16:26.376 --> 16:27.856
All right, what the fuck
am I supposed to say?

16:27.943 --> 16:29.727
Surviving the crippling ennui

16:29.814 --> 16:30.859
of growing up
in bumfuck nowhere?

16:30.946 --> 16:31.991
I'm sorry.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.514
I just...
I couldn't hear you over

16:33.601 --> 16:35.603
the high whine
of your shining trust fund.

16:35.690 --> 16:36.865
My greatest achievement
cannot be that

16:36.952 --> 16:38.127
I've had no achievement.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.390
Well, you are gonna
be valedictorian.

16:40.477 --> 16:41.478
Boring.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.959
- You have a 4.6 GPA.
- Boring.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.265
And you've successfully...

16:45.352 --> 16:46.353
- What?
- Well...

16:46.440 --> 16:49.008
You've successfully, um...

16:49.791 --> 16:50.966
Well...

16:51.445 --> 16:52.881
Shit.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.970
I guess you're just another
run-of-the-mill,

16:55.057 --> 16:56.493
generationally wealthy gal

16:56.580 --> 16:58.582
livin' in
a haunted ancestral mansion.

16:58.669 --> 16:59.714
Fuck.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.456
So...

17:02.543 --> 17:05.502
- Experience something.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.721
Like what?

17:06.808 --> 17:08.070
Something worth writing about.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.119
You could write a treatise
on teacher-student affairs.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.339
How exactly would that
be an achievement, Winnie?

17:16.426 --> 17:17.558
Easy.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.516
It becomes a conversation

17:19.603 --> 17:21.649
about achieving emancipation

17:21.736 --> 17:25.348
from your inherited beliefs
about sex and age.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.133
You're not seriously
gonna fuck Fillmore, are you?

17:27.220 --> 17:29.309
Haven't decided yet.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.093
What's it to you?

17:31.180 --> 17:32.268
Like, he's, like,

17:32.355 --> 17:34.575
- twenty years older than you.
- So?

17:34.662 --> 17:36.403
Older men have been
harvesting virginity

17:36.490 --> 17:37.969
since the dawn of time.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.540
So, it doesn't mean
anything to you?

17:43.627 --> 17:45.238
What?

17:45.325 --> 17:46.804
Your virginity.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.371
Does it mean something to you?

17:51.157 --> 17:52.158
I haven't decided yet.

17:53.855 --> 17:54.899
Come to Winnie.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.431
We're, like,

18:04.518 --> 18:07.564
the fucking
American wet dream.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.698
Young girls with
ambivalent sexuality.

18:10.785 --> 18:14.310
Pheromones steaming off
our bodies.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.704
I don't wanna drop it
for some rando jock-twat

18:16.791 --> 18:18.445
whose sexual standards
are mandated

18:18.532 --> 18:20.708
by the shit porn he downloads.

18:20.795 --> 18:21.883
That's deli meat.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.887
I want a dry-aged

18:25.974 --> 18:28.498
slab of perfectly marbled
hot man meat

18:28.585 --> 18:30.109
to take me to pleasure town.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.286
Like...

18:33.982 --> 18:35.026
Wagyu beef.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.901
Hungee.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.381
You think
that's Boris Fillmore?

18:42.773 --> 18:43.818
Why not?

18:45.559 --> 18:46.690
He's fine.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.998
He's like,
really fucking smart.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.391
And he's kind.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.697
Which means, as my first time,

18:54.829 --> 18:56.526
he'd take his time

18:56.613 --> 18:58.746
to get me all good and juiced.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.617
And then
he'd give me aftercare.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.231
You know,
the first time you have sex,

19:05.318 --> 19:06.710
it's not supposed to hurt.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.538
Right?

19:09.974 --> 19:12.325
Like,
if you're properly aroused.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.676
You likely won't even bleed.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.940
Didn't know that.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.811
That's because a woman's pain

19:20.898 --> 19:22.900
is valued more
than her pleasure.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.902
But that's a conversation
for another day.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.034
My point...

19:27.253 --> 19:30.647
is that Boris has just got it
going on.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.650
I know what I'm looking for.

19:36.262 --> 19:39.003
And I think Mr. Miller knows
what he's looking for.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.135
What do you mean?

19:41.223 --> 19:42.659
I've never seen him look
at a student

19:42.746 --> 19:43.921
the way he looks at you.

19:44.966 --> 19:47.098
He sees you

19:47.186 --> 19:48.839
even though
you hide in plain sight.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.667
- Shut up.
- What?

19:50.754 --> 19:51.929
- Stop!
- No.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.280
Come on.
Like you don't notice, Cairo.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.020
It's like he's been living
in gray scale

19:56.107 --> 19:58.893
and you're the first thing
he's ever seen in color.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.200
No, you're being... Shut up.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.163
I'd fuck you.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.209
I know.

20:19.479 --> 20:20.828
<i>"I was nothing</i>

20:20.915 --> 20:22.308
<i>"but a bleached bone monument
beneath her.</i>

20:24.571 --> 20:26.747
<i>"Human ruins
of a madman's love."</i>

20:29.402 --> 20:30.925
<i>"A madman's love."</i>

20:33.797 --> 20:35.930
<i>God, I'd give anything
to feel that.</i>

20:38.672 --> 20:42.415
<i>What muse could inspire
this deranged yearning?</i>

20:50.510 --> 20:51.685
<i>To inspire.</i>

20:52.860 --> 20:54.427
<i>To be so inspired.</i>

20:58.561 --> 21:00.346
<i>Could we be that
to each other?</i>

21:03.914 --> 21:05.568
<i>What was I saying?</i>

21:07.309 --> 21:09.180
<i>Feels like I'm not right.</i>

21:10.791 --> 21:11.966
<i>Feels good.</i>

21:13.141 --> 21:14.490
<i>It feels pink.</i>

21:14.577 --> 21:15.926
Never forget.

21:16.013 --> 21:18.625
There's a reason this guy
was called romantic.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.062
It's very big, it's very bold.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.891
To us,
it might seem a little...

21:23.978 --> 21:25.284
much.

21:27.068 --> 21:29.113
If we don't stick
to the brief,

21:29.200 --> 21:31.028
it gets a little bit woolly.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.510
Uh, can you see me
after school, please?

21:36.556 --> 21:38.601
Some of you, as you can see
could have done...

21:38.688 --> 21:40.081
<i>It's like a sugar cube
under the tongue.</i>

21:40.168 --> 21:41.169
...a little better.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.780
But worth persevering.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.478
Colby, what?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.262
<i>I want your attention.</i>

21:50.439 --> 21:52.267
Uh, how's Bea?

21:52.354 --> 21:54.617
She's, uh, she's Bea.

21:54.704 --> 21:55.923
Yeah.
How's the book coming?

21:56.010 --> 21:57.533
It's not.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.100
You mean you're not.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.971
No, she's, uh, she's occupied.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.146
All right,
what time is dinner?

22:02.233 --> 22:03.365
Seven o'clock.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.758
And please take a shower.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.237
Are you worried?

22:06.325 --> 22:09.284
Your old lady's gonna get hot
for all this?

22:09.371 --> 22:10.764
Top three worst nightmares.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.462
Yeah. Because you know
how nasty she is.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.464
No, because I wanna keep you
for myself.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.597
Aw, cutie.

22:18.859 --> 22:19.947
- Hey.
- What?

22:20.034 --> 22:21.296
You remember the Roger Rabbit?

22:21.383 --> 22:22.428
Check it out now.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.700
- It's close, right?
- To?

22:33.787 --> 22:35.005
Kids ain't got nothing on me.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.180
All right, man.
- Bye, Professor.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.573
- Love you.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.284
Ooh!

22:54.198 --> 22:55.765
F... Hi. Uh...

22:57.288 --> 23:00.770
Hello... Well,
that was embarrassing.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.903
- I won't tell.
- That's generous, thank you.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.601
Uh, hope I'm not keeping you
from anything.

23:05.688 --> 23:08.038
I'm waiting for Winnie.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.127
It's like you're always
waiting for Winnie.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.129
That sounds like
a Gin Blossoms album.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.610
<i>Waiting for Winnie.</i>

23:14.697 --> 23:17.439
Gin Blossoms? How old are you?

23:17.526 --> 23:19.528
Well, if you can't tell,
then I won't.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.009
What's Winnie doing?

23:22.096 --> 23:23.314
She's applying to Vandy.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.968
You would be pleased to know.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.666
And are you?

23:26.753 --> 23:29.320
Tennessee is a fucking
tar pit. No offense.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.236
I think you'll appreciate it
when you're older.

23:32.323 --> 23:33.368
Maybe.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.414
From afar.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.285
As it burns.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.027
- Like Nero.

23:42.682 --> 23:43.813
Well, that's...

23:43.900 --> 23:46.163
So, uh,
how far are we talkin'?

23:46.250 --> 23:47.469
Yale far.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.079
Yale far? My God!

23:49.166 --> 23:51.081
What, so you can eat
pot brownies

23:51.168 --> 23:52.866
and read Joan Didion or what?

23:52.953 --> 23:54.607
Because I hear
the literacy rate is high.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.177
You ever been to

24:00.264 --> 24:01.831
the Scroll Sessions
at Sally Bunny's?

24:01.918 --> 24:03.485
No. What's that?

24:03.572 --> 24:06.270
Poetry salon
every third Saturday.

24:06.357 --> 24:07.489
Victorian Village.

24:07.576 --> 24:09.273
- What is that?
- What's...

24:09.360 --> 24:11.014
What's that? It's blank.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.494
Ca... How can you disdain

24:12.581 --> 24:14.670
of what Tennessee has to offer

24:14.757 --> 24:18.631
without conducting a thorough,
uh, cultural investigation?

24:18.718 --> 24:20.284
Educated judgment.

24:20.371 --> 24:23.462
Well, I've heard
things there that haunt me.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.464
Because they're bad?

24:26.769 --> 24:28.771
Sometimes, yeah.
Sometimes they're bad.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.730
Most of the time, it's,
it's kind of beautiful.

24:31.774 --> 24:32.862
Yeah.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.517
Maybe you should go
this weekend.

24:35.604 --> 24:36.866
I think you might
be surprised.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.392
You wanted to see me?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.046
This week's story,

24:43.133 --> 24:47.790
uh, you wrote about
a reluctant spider.

24:47.877 --> 24:48.922
I enjoyed this one.

24:50.706 --> 24:54.275
"Survival
and desire amalgamated

24:54.362 --> 24:56.669
"and turned
an aphotic eye inward.

24:58.453 --> 25:01.935
"I saw my expectations
dismantled and dismembered

25:04.154 --> 25:07.462
"by the harsh and starving
dogs of reality.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.030
"Truths that sit in
the vacuity of space

25:10.117 --> 25:11.684
"like a hypergiant star

25:12.249 --> 25:13.512
"burning to ash.

25:15.078 --> 25:19.082
"All elements too weak
to withstand the awesome heat.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.520
"We are what we are.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.740
"And all creatures must eat."

25:28.178 --> 25:31.355
- Um...
- Damn. That, I mean...

25:31.442 --> 25:32.966
I was not expecting that.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.098
Um...

25:37.013 --> 25:38.101
She's not reluctant.

25:39.450 --> 25:40.451
She's resigned.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.714
- To her death?
- No.

25:41.801 --> 25:42.889
To the order of things.

25:44.064 --> 25:46.022
She eats and waits
to be eaten.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.329
- Phew. It's dark.
- It's nature.

25:48.416 --> 25:49.635
That's true.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.857
You memorized it.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.293
Uh...

25:56.380 --> 25:58.513
Well, I'm eidetic.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.341
It's a,
it's a cool party trick.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.650
You are...

26:07.000 --> 26:09.655
You're exceptionally talented.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.787
- Do I get an A?
- Well, how about a jumpstart

26:11.874 --> 26:13.310
on the midterm?

26:13.397 --> 26:15.225
Are you offering me
special treatment, Mr. Miller?

26:16.357 --> 26:17.924
I want you to write
a short story

26:18.011 --> 26:19.926
in the style
of your favorite author.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.885
I think it could be
the highlight

26:22.972 --> 26:24.583
of your portfolio submission

26:24.670 --> 26:26.062
- to Vanderbilt.
- Yale.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.673
-  Vanderbilt.
- Yale.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.065
Come on.
I've got to have some hope.

26:30.763 --> 26:31.981
I think
that's a terrific assignment.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.069
Thought you would.

26:33.679 --> 26:34.723
Good.

26:36.856 --> 26:37.944
I read your book.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.555
- Oh, God. Well, uh...

26:44.733 --> 26:46.648
Reviewers,
of which there were three,

26:47.257 --> 26:48.998
found it, uh,

26:49.085 --> 26:52.393
"overreaching
without ambition," to quote.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.612
I would call it...

26:54.700 --> 26:56.223
grand and tragic.

26:57.659 --> 26:58.965
Okay.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.750
Romantic horror.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.059
That's, uh...

27:07.582 --> 27:09.453
"She was an electric white

27:10.237 --> 27:11.934
"noon-shadow moon

27:13.196 --> 27:15.503
"casting cold light like water

27:15.590 --> 27:17.200
"over the flat earth
of my face.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.290
"'Don't look into the sun,'
they said.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.118
"But the moon,

27:23.076 --> 27:24.425
"the moon...

27:25.992 --> 27:27.254
"I stared until I was nothing

27:27.341 --> 27:29.386
"but a bleached bone monument
beneath her.

27:30.997 --> 27:34.000
"Human ruins
of a madman's love."

27:39.092 --> 27:40.746
Well, you memorized that, right?

27:48.928 --> 27:50.886
That was too much.
That was weird.

27:50.973 --> 27:52.105
No, it wasn't.
It's not. It's not.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.760
That was really weird.
I'm sorry.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.370
That was the first thing
I'd ever written...

27:59.068 --> 28:00.417
which felt tangible.

28:00.504 --> 28:02.768
Like I'd touched somethin'.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.295
You know,
I haven't written anything

28:08.382 --> 28:10.601
- in a very long time.
- Why not?

28:10.689 --> 28:11.690
I don't know.

28:12.603 --> 28:13.648
Do I know?

28:15.128 --> 28:16.346
Mm?

28:16.433 --> 28:18.697
Uh...

28:18.784 --> 28:20.307
I guess I got married.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.701
Started teaching.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.836
I don't have anything else
to say.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.013
You're uninspired.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.363
- You judging me?
- I am challenging you.

28:33.450 --> 28:34.887
That's my job.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.810
Hi, Winnie.
- Oh, no.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.164
- Hungee.
I think she's hungry.

28:51.251 --> 28:52.426
She just doesn't use
real words

28:52.513 --> 28:53.906
because she's a child.

28:56.909 --> 28:59.259
No, it's fine.
Your hair looks great.

28:59.346 --> 29:00.782
- I knew it.
- Please don't start.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.262
Don't.
- Your hair looks good.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.263
I will not go...
- I'm more concerned...

29:03.350 --> 29:04.873
...gently into the good night.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.048
- No, I know. You look fine.
Like you have.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.354
I'm just more concerned
about the fact

29:07.441 --> 29:08.181
that you got two damn phones
on the table

29:08.268 --> 29:09.312
like you're a rapper.

29:09.399 --> 29:10.836
This one
is my professional phone.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.402
And the other one...

29:12.489 --> 29:13.839
The other one...
- ...is for selling drugs.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.144
- The other one is personal.
Oh, yeah?

29:15.231 --> 29:16.145
That's why you're not gonna
get that number.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.845
How y'all doin'?
That burger treatin' you well?

29:19.932 --> 29:21.760
Sorry,
it's a two-man show tonight.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.284
- I'm getting angry now.

29:24.371 --> 29:26.025
Well...
Well, hi.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.983
I don't see any Michelin stars
here, honey.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.724
So, what is the holdup?

29:29.811 --> 29:31.160
A fuck-up...
- Bea. Come on.

29:31.247 --> 29:32.814
...in the kitchen
that was entirely preventable.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.948
Can I get you anything
while you wait?

29:36.035 --> 29:38.167
- On me.
- Another Maker's.

29:38.254 --> 29:39.821
Okay, you got it.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.867
- Coach?
Blue Moon.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.520
Workin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

29:43.607 --> 29:45.609
Drinkin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

29:45.696 --> 29:47.829
Oh, you think sassing me
is gonna get you a better tip?

29:47.916 --> 29:49.309
Gets me
a better grade.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.398
Doesn't it?

29:51.485 --> 29:53.356
- That might be true, yeah.
- Anything for you, Mr. Miller?

29:53.443 --> 29:54.836
I'm good, Winnie.

29:54.923 --> 29:55.968
Designated driver.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.491
- Oh.
Oh, really?

29:57.578 --> 29:58.753
- Unless you wanna do it.
- First I'm hearing of this.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.843
You know, why can't you just
be a nice,

30:01.930 --> 30:04.454
boring teacher
like Mr. Miller?

30:04.541 --> 30:06.021
- Boring?

30:06.108 --> 30:07.066
What? And let
my students make their grades

30:07.153 --> 30:08.458
with scholastic merit?

30:08.545 --> 30:09.590
Do you really think
I'm boring?

30:09.677 --> 30:11.113
In a good way.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.420
Like a nice pastoral.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.291
I'll get those drinks for you.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.902
Yeah. "Pastoral."

30:16.989 --> 30:18.338
She just called you a field.

30:18.425 --> 30:19.600
At best.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.428
- She's cute.
- Yeah, and a 4.4 student.

30:21.515 --> 30:22.690
And she can paint.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.300
She's in my morning class.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.825
Oh, is this the last scion
of James Joyce?

30:26.912 --> 30:28.522
That's Cairo.

30:28.609 --> 30:29.871
- Cairo?
Yeah.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.220
Did he tell you that
Cairo read his book?

30:31.307 --> 30:33.092
He sure did.

30:33.179 --> 30:36.051
- Is she pretty?
Is she pretty?

30:36.138 --> 30:37.836
Um, I don't know.
She's talented.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.359
Damn. Even worse.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.230
Our friend Jon here
is prepping her to be

30:41.317 --> 30:43.972
his transcendence into
the annals of academic glory.

30:44.059 --> 30:46.496
And so what if I am?
It's exhilarating.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.237
And it's rare as well

30:48.324 --> 30:49.630
- to be so engaged and so...
- Hmm. I bet is is. Yes.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.414
- So worshipped.
- So worthy.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.242
- Wanna be like me.
- She, in earnest

30:53.329 --> 30:55.897
uses words
like "vituperation."

30:55.984 --> 30:57.072
Please.

30:57.159 --> 30:58.769
Vocabulary doesn't make
you a writer

30:58.857 --> 31:01.381
any more than math
makes you a rocket scientist.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.687
Bea, she's extraordinary.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.515
- Okay?
- But enjoy it while you can.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.300
You know, pickings are slim
in the boonies.

31:07.387 --> 31:09.128
Rural education
not as romantic

31:09.215 --> 31:10.433
as you thought it'd be, huh?

31:10.520 --> 31:11.870
No, I thought it was going
to be fucking

31:11.957 --> 31:13.567
<i>- Friday Night Lights,</i> okay?

31:13.654 --> 31:15.003
- That's on you, man.
- Just cool stories

31:15.090 --> 31:16.526
and, like, sexy guitar riffs.

31:16.613 --> 31:19.268
Meanwhile, the professor
disapproves of my cynicism.

31:19.355 --> 31:20.835
- Oh, he's judging you.
- Yes, he is. I feel it.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.141
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

31:22.228 --> 31:23.533
Are too.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.144
"The teacher
who attempts to teach

31:25.231 --> 31:26.710
"without inspiring the pupil

31:26.797 --> 31:29.888
"with a desire to learn
is hammering on cold iron."

31:29.975 --> 31:31.498
- Horace Mann.
- Ten points to Slytherin.

31:31.585 --> 31:32.586
That's so rich.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.283
I wanted to be a teacher.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.371
You fell back on it.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.156
And by the way,
I love teaching.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.114
You're better suited for it,
I think, anyway.

31:39.201 --> 31:40.942
- Hey, than what?
- Writing.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.944
Goddamn, Beatrice.
- What does that mean?

31:43.031 --> 31:44.467
You don't have kids.

31:44.554 --> 31:45.294
You don't have kids.
You don't have

31:45.381 --> 31:46.774
brain damage, right?

31:46.861 --> 31:48.819
So, um, you stopped writing

31:48.907 --> 31:50.821
I imagine,
because it wasn't for you.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.693
Otherwise,
you'd still be doing it.

31:53.607 --> 31:54.651
I'm a writer.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.131
You haven't put pen to page

31:56.218 --> 31:57.916
since your stories got panned.

31:58.699 --> 31:59.700
You're not a writer.

31:59.787 --> 32:00.831
Hmm.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.617
Well, okay.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.227
Didn't realize you
saw me this way, but okay.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.750
It's not that
you can't write, Jon.

32:06.837 --> 32:07.926
It's that you don't.

32:08.665 --> 32:11.103
You chose to be a teacher.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.018
Why would I see you
as anything else?

32:15.324 --> 32:16.760
'Cause you married a writer.

32:16.847 --> 32:18.066
I did.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.589
Didn't I?

32:32.298 --> 32:33.734
<i>Why am I here?</i>

32:36.215 --> 32:38.347
<i>It's not for the poetry,
I'll tell you that.</i>

32:43.048 --> 32:44.571
<i>It's for the thrill
of something</i>

32:44.658 --> 32:46.921
<i>that I've managed to go
my whole life without knowing.</i>

32:50.533 --> 32:53.145
<i>An ache of anticipation
that you'll be here.</i>

32:57.845 --> 32:59.803
<i>And it will mean something
that you are.</i>

33:03.546 --> 33:04.634
<i>Be here.</i>

33:04.721 --> 33:06.288
<i>Be here. Be here.</i>

33:09.944 --> 33:11.337
"Stay, illusion.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.861
"If thou hast any sound,
speak to me."

33:16.124 --> 33:18.170
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.780
Can I sit?
Of course.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.177
What's that you got there?

33:25.264 --> 33:28.136
It's, um,
sacramental grape juice.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.877
Said the barrister's daughter.

33:30.965 --> 33:31.922
Do you know
all these people?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.315
Uh, most of them.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.274
We've been doing this
for a couple years now.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.798
- Like group therapy?

33:38.668 --> 33:40.714
Yeah, exactly that.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.760
Who's that fellow?
That's Elliot.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.719
Three-time Ostrander winner.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.547
He just finished
playing Edmund in <i>Lear.</i>

33:47.634 --> 33:49.288
It's sure to get him
his fourth.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.680
Hmm.

33:50.767 --> 33:53.205
"It is my intention
to escape you

33:54.858 --> 33:56.469
"and leave you far behind...

33:58.079 --> 34:00.299
"...bereft of me and aching.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.650
"Puzzled by the pain
in your rib.

34:05.565 --> 34:06.870
"Not quite heartache.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.351
"Not quite homesick.

34:10.222 --> 34:11.962
"Me-shaped and filled

34:12.050 --> 34:14.008
"with the remnants of stars.

34:15.488 --> 34:18.621
"You choke up the void
with verdurous blooms,

34:18.708 --> 34:20.971
"and the wrap of my veins
around you.

34:23.235 --> 34:24.975
"The hideous pulse,

34:25.802 --> 34:27.239
"the shouting blood,

34:28.631 --> 34:30.938
"the ventricle kudzu
smothering you

34:31.025 --> 34:32.113
"with wanting

34:33.201 --> 34:36.291
"is turned hideously soft
in reminiscence.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.296
"And yet
some part of me stays.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.211
"Some bit,

34:44.082 --> 34:45.213
"some parcel,

34:46.562 --> 34:48.738
"some ash left behind.

34:50.914 --> 34:53.787
"And with it,
you will recreate me.

34:53.874 --> 34:57.660
"A moving effigy,
a patch-work person."

35:02.100 --> 35:03.275
"But they are not me.

35:04.450 --> 35:07.496
"And the space I left
grows misshapen."

35:11.587 --> 35:14.024
"I will never fit there
again."

35:23.556 --> 35:24.600
What?

35:26.036 --> 35:27.560
I can see.

35:28.561 --> 35:29.649
It was really something.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.434
Hot dog.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.393
You thought it was gonna
be trash, didn't you?

35:35.307 --> 35:36.482
Yes, I did.

35:37.396 --> 35:38.571
Have more faith.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.058
<i>What is the word?</i>

35:49.799 --> 35:52.193
<i>It's not falling.
That's too stale.</i>

35:54.848 --> 35:56.545
<i>It's more deliberate
than that.</i>

35:58.373 --> 36:01.463
<i>It's recognition
of what we really are.</i>

36:04.597 --> 36:05.815
<i>Ghosts.</i>

36:08.166 --> 36:09.819
<i>You do see me.</i>

36:11.952 --> 36:13.606
<i>And I see you.</i>

36:22.528 --> 36:25.661
Goddamn, Tennessee,
why are you so fuckin' hot?

36:25.748 --> 36:27.663
- Go inside.
- And miss Godot?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.143
Gifts for the wallflowers.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.884
Oh. Okay.
Mm. Hmm.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.364
Thank you.
What's this?

36:33.626 --> 36:35.105
Coffee.
- No, no.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.543
What's this? What is...
What's with the, uh, new look?

36:37.630 --> 36:40.285
Thank you for this. It's,
uh... It's very generous.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.200
No one should have to suffer
cafeteria coffee.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.940
You want a biscuit, biscuit?

36:44.027 --> 36:45.681
- What flavor?
- Split fig.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.857
Mm.

36:47.944 --> 36:49.207
Excuse me.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.773
It's good.
- Come on, man.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.210
You got
a little split fig in you?

36:52.297 --> 36:54.603
- Not right now. Really?
- Caught in your throat?

36:54.690 --> 36:56.431
- You know what you should do?
What should I do?

36:56.518 --> 36:57.867
You should make a logo
and sell these

36:57.954 --> 36:59.521
- to raise money for the team.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.393
Don't laugh.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.481
You'd buy some, wouldn't you,
Mr. Miller?

37:02.568 --> 37:03.786
- Oh, yeah.
- He doesn't count.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.484
I can't resist a cute boy
with a biscuit.

37:05.571 --> 37:07.529
Right?
Winnie could design the logo.

37:07.616 --> 37:08.661
Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:08.748 --> 37:09.749
She's really good
at that stuff.

37:10.663 --> 37:11.664
Really?
- Coach.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.536
Call yourself
the Biscuit Batters.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.016
Winnie and I could help you
get it off the ground.

37:16.103 --> 37:17.626
What's in it for you?

37:17.713 --> 37:19.541
- What's in it for me?
Mm-hmm.

37:19.628 --> 37:22.370
Oh, well, I mean,
it's pleasure, you know?

37:22.457 --> 37:24.154
Connection. 5%.

37:26.374 --> 37:28.811
- I'm the Biscuit Batter.
- No. Once more with pride.

37:28.898 --> 37:31.901
- I'm the Biscuit Batter!
- Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.251
I'm the...

37:33.338 --> 37:34.643
I'm gonna work on that.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.210
Um, but I'm leaving
before I fucking burn up.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.343
- Y'all coming inside?
- You go ahead.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.040
All right, suit yourself.

37:40.127 --> 37:42.085
I'll suit myself. See you now.

37:42.172 --> 37:43.348
Mm.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.052
Hi.

37:53.532 --> 37:54.620
Hi.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.364
You're sweet.

38:01.322 --> 38:02.497
When it suits.

38:06.414 --> 38:07.415
Please.

38:09.025 --> 38:10.070
Thank you.
Mm.

38:32.527 --> 38:34.312
What did he say
about the outfit?

38:34.399 --> 38:36.096
He didn't have
to say anything.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.968
Oh.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.318
You ready? Can we go?

38:40.405 --> 38:42.145
No. I need to stop
by his class.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.757
Can I watch?

38:44.844 --> 38:46.106
- Oh, hi.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.237
Hey.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.326
How are you, kid?

38:51.198 --> 38:52.330
Are you in a hurry?

38:52.417 --> 38:53.983
Well, I'm just goin' on
a little, uh,

38:54.810 --> 38:57.073
weekend vacation with my wife.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.382
What do writers
do on vacation?

39:01.469 --> 39:02.514
Uh, excuse me.

39:02.601 --> 39:05.560
Um, well,
they pretend to write

39:05.647 --> 39:07.083
someplace else, I guess.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.609
Uh, can we talk about
the midterm?

39:10.696 --> 39:12.088
Uh, sure, what's on your mind?

39:12.175 --> 39:13.916
I want your approval
on my author before I start.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.396
Okay. Who is it?

39:15.483 --> 39:17.050
Henry Miller.

39:17.137 --> 39:19.661
Provocative and,
uh...

39:19.748 --> 39:22.272
...his structure is very
challenging to emulate.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.797
It's not just structural,
though, it's everythin'.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.146
You know, his decadence,

39:26.233 --> 39:28.931
his total disregard
for literary etiquette,

39:29.018 --> 39:30.977
his, um,
destruction of convention.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.109
It's...
It's all the good stuff.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.898
- Do you not think I can do it?
- Look,

39:38.985 --> 39:41.727
Miller is public enemy
number one

39:41.814 --> 39:42.945
with the censors.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.773
I'm not even approved
to teach him.

39:46.514 --> 39:47.515
So?

39:49.648 --> 39:52.346
So, it would be like
a controversial choice.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.960
If it's not controversial,
it's not interestin'.

39:59.658 --> 40:00.963
Okay.

40:01.616 --> 40:02.617
Okay, yes?

40:03.270 --> 40:04.663
Okay, I trust you.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.274
Write what you know,
little ghost.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.237
Damn, I gotta go. Uh...

40:15.195 --> 40:16.892
Do me a favor.

40:16.979 --> 40:19.155
Have some fun this weekend,
will you?

40:19.721 --> 40:20.766
Take a recess.

40:22.028 --> 40:23.508
Yeah, I'll rest if you write.

40:23.595 --> 40:25.553
Uh, listen,
I'll see you Monday, okay?

40:25.640 --> 40:26.641
Bye, Winnie.

40:29.949 --> 40:31.080
- Don't do that.

40:32.647 --> 40:33.735
Don't look at me like that.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.610
Hmm...

40:39.959 --> 40:41.090
"Oh..."

40:41.177 --> 40:43.005
No, I never did that.

40:43.092 --> 40:44.703
- Stop.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.358
Wait, Winnie, don't...

40:48.446 --> 40:50.796
"Oh, Mr. Miller,

40:50.883 --> 40:55.235
"I just love the decadence,
and the words

40:55.322 --> 40:58.064
"and breakin' all the rules!"

40:58.151 --> 40:59.457
Okay, enough, enough.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.067
- You need to get off his desk.

41:01.154 --> 41:02.677
I did not say it like that.

41:02.764 --> 41:04.244
Oh, but you meant it
like that.

41:04.331 --> 41:06.115
- No, I didn't.
- You're seducin' him,

41:06.202 --> 41:08.291
you floozy.

41:08.378 --> 41:10.163
- We make a good double team.

41:10.729 --> 41:12.252
Hi.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.862
Am I interruptin'?

41:13.949 --> 41:15.908
- We were just leavin'.
Where's Jon?

41:15.995 --> 41:17.605
Uh, where's Mr. Miller?

41:17.692 --> 41:18.780
He left.

41:18.867 --> 41:21.348
Shoot.
Oh, while I have you. Cairo.

41:21.435 --> 41:23.089
I think your idea
is fresh to death.

41:23.176 --> 41:24.307
And, uh, Winnie...

41:24.394 --> 41:26.266
- I'd like your help too.
- With what?

41:26.353 --> 41:27.528
Well, can you keep the secret?

41:27.615 --> 41:28.616
Sure can.

41:28.703 --> 41:29.748
I bake biscuits.

41:29.835 --> 41:31.053
He's gonna have
the baseball team

41:31.140 --> 41:32.402
sell them to raise money.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.448
But Fillmore wants you
to design the logo.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.102
I think that's really cool.

41:36.189 --> 41:38.408
- Really?
- I'd love to help.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.758
Cool. All right.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.107
I'll call you guys out
on your lunch period.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.151
We can go over the specs.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.023
Hey, um...

41:44.980 --> 41:46.416
I think it'd be easier

41:46.504 --> 41:48.549
if you just gave me
your phone.

41:48.636 --> 41:51.117
I could text you the specs.

41:51.204 --> 41:52.553
It'd be faster that way.

41:53.554 --> 41:54.903
Okay.

41:55.338 --> 41:56.383
Great.

41:58.603 --> 41:59.734
Hey, can you call me?

42:00.779 --> 42:02.694
Mm. Mm-hmm.

42:02.781 --> 42:05.044
And now
you'll have Cairo's number.

42:05.566 --> 42:06.567
Oh, good.

42:08.134 --> 42:09.527
There is no reception
in here.

42:09.614 --> 42:10.702
Shit.
Cairo, it's probably

42:10.789 --> 42:12.442
just at the bottom
of your bag.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.270
No, I just had it
a minute ago.

42:14.357 --> 42:15.924
Well, it's Friday,

42:16.882 --> 42:18.274
and we're still here.

42:18.361 --> 42:19.798
So let's a-fucking go.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.151
Oh, uh, Winnie?

42:25.804 --> 42:27.022
Uh, Boris?

42:28.371 --> 42:31.287
-  My phone.
- My phone.

42:31.374 --> 42:33.420
- Your phone.
- Your phone?

42:33.507 --> 42:36.728
Your phone!

42:36.815 --> 42:39.644
- Right.  Sorry. Okay.
- Oh, okay. Okay.

42:39.731 --> 42:41.646
- Well, that was my...
- Ah.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.212
<i>♪ Danger, danger ♪</i>

42:43.299 --> 42:45.737
<i>♪ High voltage ♪</i>

42:45.824 --> 42:48.000
Baby, I'm gonna need
a few more minutes, all right?

42:48.087 --> 42:50.916
Okay. Well, we were supposed
to leave 40 minutes ago.

42:51.003 --> 42:52.787
I know.

42:52.874 --> 42:55.181
- If Amy did her fucking job...

42:55.268 --> 42:56.574
...we could've left yesterday.

43:03.363 --> 43:04.669
It's just not enough, Amy.

43:04.756 --> 43:05.757
What the f...?

43:07.715 --> 43:09.543
Yes, I'll hold.

43:09.630 --> 43:11.371
- Hello?
<i>Hi.</i>

43:11.458 --> 43:12.502
You have my phone.

43:13.765 --> 43:15.288
<i>And whose phone
do I have?</i>

43:15.375 --> 43:16.419
Cairo Sweet's.

43:17.159 --> 43:18.596
Cairo. It's, uh...

43:19.597 --> 43:21.511
It's Jon... It's Mr. Miller.

43:24.950 --> 43:26.560
- Sticky fingers, Miller.
<i>- Uh...</i>

43:27.126 --> 43:28.431
Uh, how are you?

43:28.518 --> 43:29.911
I'm tethered to a landline.

43:29.998 --> 43:31.913
<i>- Are you already gone?</i>
- Uh, well, should be.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.654
I don't give
a flying backwards fuck, Amy.

43:33.741 --> 43:34.786
Just give 'em the first draft.

43:34.873 --> 43:36.570
- Hang on.
- They'll think it's new.

43:36.657 --> 43:38.137
Honey. Honey,
I've, I've gotta drop

43:38.224 --> 43:39.399
somethin' off
at a student's house.

43:39.486 --> 43:40.922
All right, take care of it.

43:41.009 --> 43:42.141
Oh, get me some tampons
while you're out, all right?

43:42.228 --> 43:43.403
- Yeah.
- Organic ones,

43:43.490 --> 43:44.491
- if you can find 'em.
- Mm-hmm.

43:44.578 --> 43:46.275
Not you obviously, Amy. Fuck.

43:46.362 --> 43:47.407
Get me a better deal,

43:47.494 --> 43:48.843
and then
you can plug my pussy.

43:48.930 --> 43:51.237
<i>You big time,
"road head" owe me.</i>

43:53.805 --> 43:55.067
<i>Are you still there?</i>

43:55.154 --> 43:56.242
I'm still here.

43:58.331 --> 43:59.767
You at Lovell Hill right now?

43:59.854 --> 44:01.203
<i>Yes.</i>
- Okay.

44:01.290 --> 44:03.118
Well, I'll drop it off
before we leave,

44:03.205 --> 44:04.511
if that's okay.

44:07.296 --> 44:08.428
<i>Do you need
the address?</i>

44:09.342 --> 44:11.474
I know exactly where you are.

44:11.561 --> 44:13.433
<i>Good. All right,
well, drive safe.</i>

44:14.216 --> 44:15.261
It's gonna rain.

44:18.743 --> 44:20.266
<i>How does love come?</i>

Why?

53:31.338 --> 53:32.557
This is inappropriate.

53:33.819 --> 53:35.560
"Inappropriate."

53:35.647 --> 53:36.648
What does that mean?

53:38.084 --> 53:39.564

53:39.651 --> 53:40.913
- You asked me to.
- Uh-huh.

53:42.088 --> 53:43.916
Okay.

53:44.003 --> 53:45.483
Why did you choose
that material?

53:45.570 --> 53:47.354
You said,
"Write what you know."

53:47.441 --> 53:49.226
And this is what you know?

53:49.704 --> 53:50.749

54:02.761 --> 54:04.415
Okay. It's...

It's about two like people

54:09.158 --> 54:10.421
You know, it's commentary

54:10.508 --> 54:11.944
on the sexual anesthetization
of a culture

54:12.031 --> 54:14.294
that's super saturated
with pornography.

54:14.381 --> 54:17.254
It's about the inefficacy
of romantic dogmas

54:17.341 --> 54:19.125
on young people's
expectations.

54:20.431 --> 54:22.476

inexorable attraction.

54:24.522 --> 54:26.175
It's layered.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.003
- This is pornography.
- Yes.

So put it in your diary,

54:39.058 --> 54:40.755
Are you talking about
the story or us?

54:41.278 --> 54:42.279
Both.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.893
You already have.
You inspired it.

54:50.199 --> 54:51.288
I can't accept it.

54:53.377 --> 54:54.769
But you can't or you won't?

54:58.469 --> 55:00.253
Because it sounds like
you're scared...

55:00.340 --> 55:01.385
- Hey. Hey.
- ...and it looks like

55:01.472 --> 55:02.647
you're measurin'.

55:05.302 --> 55:06.346
Stop talking to me
like a stranger,

55:06.433 --> 55:08.043
- and say what you mean.
- Rewrite it.

55:08.130 --> 55:09.131
Why?

55:09.218 --> 55:11.656
- You know why.
- Tell me.

55:11.743 --> 55:13.266
- Say it.
- If you don't rewrite this,

55:13.353 --> 55:14.528
I'll have to fail you
for the midterm.

55:14.615 --> 55:15.921
- Tell me why.
- I don't have to tell you

55:16.008 --> 55:17.052
a goddamn thing.

55:21.970 --> 55:23.450
It made you feel something
that scared you.

55:23.537 --> 55:25.409
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- Then say them yourself.

55:26.453 --> 55:27.889
Tell me what it made you feel.

55:29.282 --> 55:30.805
Incredibly foolish

55:30.892 --> 55:33.721
for havin' trusted
this material to a child.

55:36.942 --> 55:38.073
What was I before you read it?

55:48.519 --> 55:49.911
A student.

55:52.523 --> 55:53.567
You built the world.

55:55.656 --> 55:58.311
You built the fantasy,
not on the page,

55:58.398 --> 55:59.791
but in real life.

56:02.054 --> 56:04.056
You can't blur the lines

56:04.143 --> 56:05.274
and then expect me to see
a boundary

56:05.362 --> 56:06.363
when I suddenly cross it.

56:10.715 --> 56:12.325
Let me be very, very clear...

56:14.414 --> 56:15.415
...with you.

56:18.505 --> 56:19.506
You're my student.

56:20.768 --> 56:21.943
And I'm your teacher.

56:24.032 --> 56:25.077
That's all.

56:27.122 --> 56:29.211
Any misconception of that
is something,

56:29.298 --> 56:31.431
regrettably, that you have
to shoulder...

56:32.867 --> 56:33.912
alone.

57:07.902 --> 57:09.426
"Write what you know"
is what you said.

57:11.471 --> 57:13.255
Yeah, I know what I said.

57:13.342 --> 57:14.996
You don't know anything
you say.

57:21.699 --> 57:23.440
- This is good.
- Mm-hmm.

57:25.006 --> 57:26.007
And you know it is.

57:30.055 --> 57:31.752
So, let's examine
the real issue.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.191
It's not my writing.

57:38.933 --> 57:40.326
- It's yours.

57:43.024 --> 57:44.069
Good try.

57:45.679 --> 57:47.725
You thought you were
gonna be hot shit, didn't you?

57:47.812 --> 57:49.074
What?

57:49.161 --> 57:51.163
You thought that
you were gonna be somebody.

57:52.860 --> 57:53.905
Right?

57:58.300 --> 58:00.085
"Overreaching
without ambition."

58:06.004 --> 58:07.266
Do you know what that means?

58:11.879 --> 58:13.925
It means you weren't brave
enough to be better.

58:17.494 --> 58:19.017
Means
you're deliberately impotent.

58:22.629 --> 58:25.632
It means that you,
Jonathan Miller...

58:28.026 --> 58:29.331
are mediocre.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.555
You wanna fail me?

58:37.949 --> 58:39.167
I fucking dare you.

58:42.388 --> 58:43.998
But you better make it mean
somethin' to you.

58:46.435 --> 58:47.698
And you better know
what it means.

58:50.091 --> 58:52.180
Because the cost is very high,
Mr. Miller.

58:54.618 --> 58:57.534
And if you're not very,
very careful

58:59.448 --> 59:03.191
this banality, this falsity
that you wallow in,

59:05.759 --> 59:07.761
it will devour you
until you are as small

59:07.848 --> 59:08.936
as you pretend to be.

59:13.158 --> 59:14.289
And you will disappear.

59:18.772 --> 59:20.295
And no one will pay
any more thought to you

59:20.382 --> 59:22.036
than they do an unread
cookie fortune.

59:33.004 --> 59:35.049
How disappointin' you must be

59:35.136 --> 59:36.703
to those who had believed
you'd be more.

59:45.277 --> 59:46.452
No wonder you're here.

01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:05.602

01:00:22.531 --> 01:00:24.490
<i>It smells
like burnin' flowers.</i>

01:00:29.843 --> 01:00:31.366
<i>It feels like violence.</i>

01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:07.228
How you doin', Professor?

01:01:07.315 --> 01:01:09.317
Had a bad day.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.854
- Oh, you want a drink?
- Thank you.

01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:31.862
What?
So, he was offended?

01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:34.255
He was affected.

01:01:36.562 --> 01:01:37.694
Are you still into him?

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:44.962
He's a pretender.

01:01:49.314 --> 01:01:50.358
You know, at least what

01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:51.577
you see with Boris
is what you get.

01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:54.058
You know,
Jonathan Miller is like...

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.063
He's like
fuckin' imitation crab

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.455
and gas station sushi.

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:05.417
Aren't you in love with him?

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:10.117
Mm.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.732
What happened?

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:23.522
I had
a very unpleasant conversation

01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:25.219
with a student about
the midterm assignment.

01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:27.395
Was it with her?

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.484
Your acolyte?

01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:34.751
She drafted something

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:38.189
to make Henry Miller
look like Dr. Seuss.

01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:40.408
Well, you let a teenager
run with Miller,

01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:42.106
and you're surprised
it's vulgar?

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:44.804
She was supposed to use
his literary structure,

01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:46.284
not his subject matter.

01:02:46.371 --> 01:02:47.415
Oh.

01:02:48.155 --> 01:02:50.505
What's the subject matter?

01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:52.116
An English teacher
and a student

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:56.033
who have an illicit affair
complete with "pre-cum"

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.425
- and "cherry popping."
- Oh.

01:02:57.512 --> 01:02:59.253
- Those words exactly.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.820
Show me right now.

01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:03.301
Don't...

01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:06.783
Come on.
Tell me what shocked you.

01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:11.570
You fuck Fillmore yet?

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:16.357
You know when
I'm in my luteal phase,

01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:17.881
I tell you everything.

01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:26.324

01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:28.152

Baby, it's a love letter.

01:03:33.766 --> 01:03:35.594
She's got it bad.

01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:37.422
Tell me how she describes you.

01:03:37.509 --> 01:03:39.076
- You can read it right there.
- No.

01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:41.165
You tell me.

01:03:41.252 --> 01:03:44.646
Because I know that
you remember it word for word.

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:47.693
And I want you
to do the thing.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:48.825
No. No.

01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:52.393
Tell me.

- Or are some cunts...

- Yeah, tell him

you're drunk textin' him.

01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:23.528
That way,
he'll imagine you drunk,

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:25.182
and what
you might be doin' drunkenly.

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:26.879
Serious?

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.055
Ask him what he's up to.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.671
- Oh, we've got company.

01:05:36.758 --> 01:05:38.456
- They what?
- Hey, seriously.

01:05:38.543 --> 01:05:40.284
Stop leaving
this door unlocked.

01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:43.156
For your own safety, okay?

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.505
- Mm-hmm.
- Hello.

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:49.946
Get a room!

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:51.382
What up, player?

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:53.297
Slang? Get out.
- Fuck.

01:05:53.384 --> 01:05:54.994
Do you think he likes me?

01:05:56.865 --> 01:05:59.216
Well, do you wanna be liked,
or do you wanna be fucked?

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.265
'Cause those are very
different things

01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:09.704
I want both.

01:06:20.628 --> 01:06:21.978
You should tell him
you're with me.

01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:26.939
And that we're doing
what all girls do

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:28.071
when they're alone at night.

01:06:29.507 --> 01:06:30.812
- Who is she?

01:06:30.899 --> 01:06:31.988
Not telling.

Why are you so mean?

01:06:47.481 --> 01:06:48.656
- Goddamn.
- Can I help it

you've ever dated

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.964

01:06:52.051 --> 01:06:53.270
and was named after
a character

01:06:53.357 --> 01:06:54.706
in <i>The Baby-Sitters Club?</i>

01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:56.012
- No, I can't.
- No. You can't.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.970
But you know what?
Your life, your choice.

01:06:58.057 --> 01:06:59.493
- Yeah, you bein' a snob.

You and I know
Kristy was great.

01:07:01.626 --> 01:07:03.280
He hasn't said anything?

01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:11.244
Oh, well, he said,
"Go to bed."

01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:12.550
So...

01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:21.428
Take off your shirt.

01:07:25.563 --> 01:07:26.955
What?

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.132
- Why?
- We are gonna make out.

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:36.617
Well, it can be
a little for me.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.064

01:07:50.979 --> 01:07:52.068
Yeah, good.

I meant like this.

-  Another beer?
- Mm.

01:10:32.576 --> 01:10:34.186

Well, it had a "For Jonathan.
Love, Cairo..."

01:11:12.746 --> 01:11:15.227
...written at
the top, so, you know...

01:11:15.314 --> 01:11:17.316
there's no mistakin'.

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:19.100

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.280
Paperwork for what?

01:11:25.585 --> 01:11:26.978

01:11:31.678 --> 01:11:33.419
Who did what, huh?

01:11:34.594 --> 01:11:36.640
Cairo. Cairo turned it in.

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:42.298
It's a short story, Jonathan.

01:11:43.473 --> 01:11:46.867
It's not
<i>The Communist Manifesto.</i>

01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:48.216
Mm-hmm. I know.

01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:54.005
But, yeah, but,
it's the, uh...

01:11:55.093 --> 01:11:56.399
it's the implication.

01:11:56.486 --> 01:11:59.532
Why if she can convince them

01:11:59.619 --> 01:12:01.882
that somethin' happened
between us, then, uh...

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:05.321
Well, I could lose my job.

01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:11.457
That's not all you could lose.

01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:25.950
Did somethin' happen
between you?

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.301
Nothin' I invited.

01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:35.002
Teenage girls are dangerous,
Jonathan.

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:38.266
They're full
of emotional violence

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.747
- and vituperation.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:43.271 --> 01:12:44.969
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

01:13:33.496 --> 01:13:34.758
Have you seen Cairo?

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:39.110
- I haven't.
- I haven't seen her.

01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:40.503
And I just thought...

01:13:42.635 --> 01:13:44.681
- maybe you had.
- I haven't. No.

01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:51.731
- You don't text?
- She tell you we do?

01:13:52.602 --> 01:13:54.691
Well, you know...

01:13:56.736 --> 01:14:00.566
Cairo says everything...

01:14:04.091 --> 01:14:05.136
And nothing.

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:14.188
I don't understand
what's happening.

01:14:18.584 --> 01:14:19.629
Don't you, Winnie?

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:46.830
How did it start?
In your own words.

01:14:46.917 --> 01:14:48.701
We recognized each other.

01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:51.312
She's exceptionally talented.

01:14:51.399 --> 01:14:54.620
Uh, she's singular in that
at this school.

01:14:54.707 --> 01:14:56.404
Did you exhibit favoritism?

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.624
- Give special mentorship?
- Of course.

01:14:58.711 --> 01:14:59.799
He was excited to give me

01:14:59.886 --> 01:15:01.540
the midterm assignment
in advance.

01:15:01.627 --> 01:15:03.629
And the midterm is what
percentage of the final grade?

01:15:03.716 --> 01:15:04.891
It's 25%.

01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:07.154
Enough to destroy my GPA.

01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:08.504
<i>You do know
that Henry Miller</i>

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:09.635
<i>is not an approved author</i>

01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:10.941
<i>for public school study,
right?</i>

01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:13.247
She's better than
the curriculum, Joyce.

01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:14.466
You know that.

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:16.250
I wanted to help her
stand out.

01:15:16.337 --> 01:15:18.644
I think he was impressed
I knew who he was.

01:15:20.472 --> 01:15:22.169
Have you read his work?

01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:23.693
How often have you
been together

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.782
beyond the classroom?

01:15:25.869 --> 01:15:27.392
We would see each other
before school,

01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:31.091
uh, in class, of course,
and sometimes after.

01:15:32.353 --> 01:15:33.703
And what would you do?

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.313
We would talk about literature

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.576
and things that
we cared about.

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:40.840
Sometimes we'd share
a cigarette.

01:15:40.927 --> 01:15:44.670
We happened to be smoking
in the same place one time.

01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:45.758
And that, well, that...

01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:47.368
That's how it started,
I guess.

01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:48.848
Not...

01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:51.721
I mean, that is how
we started smokin' together.

01:15:53.374 --> 01:15:55.376
Do you see each other
socially?

01:15:55.463 --> 01:15:56.900
Absolutely not.

01:15:56.987 --> 01:15:59.337
We went to
a poetry reading together.

01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:01.034
Would you consider
yourself friends?

01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:02.253
Without question.

01:16:02.732 --> 01:16:05.430
We are as close,

01:16:05.517 --> 01:16:09.390
uh, as is appropriate
for a student and a teacher.

01:16:09.477 --> 01:16:10.827
Have you ever been
alone together

01:16:10.914 --> 01:16:12.176
outside of school?

01:16:12.263 --> 01:16:13.830
Only a couple of times.

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:15.919
Y... Yes, sort of.

01:16:16.006 --> 01:16:19.792
Uh, I mistakenly left
with her phone

01:16:19.879 --> 01:16:22.795
from the classroom,
and I returned it to her, uh,

01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:27.147
before my wife and I
went on a business trip

01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:28.279
to Nashville.

01:16:28.366 --> 01:16:29.802
We didn't actually go,

01:16:29.889 --> 01:16:33.153
but, you know,
we were going to go.

01:16:34.894 --> 01:16:36.069
He came to my house.

01:16:37.114 --> 01:16:38.115
Were you alone?

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.641
Yes.

01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:45.078
My parents were out of town.

01:16:45.165 --> 01:16:46.558
What happened?

01:16:48.691 --> 01:16:49.866
Why?
She say somethin' happened?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.611
Nothin' that didn't seem okay
at the time.

01:16:57.569 --> 01:16:58.744
I returned her phone.

01:16:58.831 --> 01:17:00.311
Did you go inside the house?

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.143
I didn't touch her, okay?
Um...

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:08.667
When she sent the story,

01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:10.756
I told her it was not
appropriate for school.

01:17:19.983 --> 01:17:21.854
I'm gettin' the impression
there's nothin' I can say,

01:17:22.812 --> 01:17:23.813
uh,

01:17:24.596 --> 01:17:26.554
to defend my position here.

01:17:28.861 --> 01:17:30.123
'Cause there isn't.

01:17:40.394 --> 01:17:41.439
Jonathan...

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:44.703
are you in love with her?

01:17:48.707 --> 01:17:50.404
Fuck Almighty. Are you?

01:17:50.491 --> 01:17:52.537
It's not about my feelings.

01:17:55.061 --> 01:17:56.672
It's what she implies.

01:17:56.759 --> 01:17:58.412
And you know I could get
crucified for this...

01:17:58.499 --> 01:18:00.676
Oh, fuck me.
- ...while you're sittin' there

01:18:00.763 --> 01:18:02.199
swiping through pictures

01:18:02.286 --> 01:18:03.635
- of naked students.
- Oh, he's so smart, everybody.

01:18:03.722 --> 01:18:04.810
That's why I deleted it.

01:18:04.897 --> 01:18:05.898
You deleted it.

01:18:05.985 --> 01:18:07.465
- Oh, good.
- No. No.

01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:09.162
Well, as soon
as you delete somethin',

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:11.338
of course, it means
it's really deleted, right?

01:18:11.425 --> 01:18:12.949
- Come on. Jesus.
- Oh, I'm shakin'

01:18:13.036 --> 01:18:14.298
in my fuckin' boots.

01:18:14.385 --> 01:18:15.603
You know the difference
between you and me?

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:19.303
You cannot identify the line.

01:18:20.521 --> 01:18:21.653
So, you cross it.

01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:23.568
Right.

01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:25.222
That's why
you're sittin' here scared,

01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:28.007
defensive.

01:18:28.094 --> 01:18:30.183
You are the adult.
Show some responsibility.

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:31.271
You can't be serious.

01:18:31.358 --> 01:18:33.143
- Like you?
- Yes.

01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:34.927
I know where the line is,
Jonathan.

01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:36.581
- Mm.
- I don't cross it.

01:18:36.668 --> 01:18:38.539
You see, knowin' the line
is knowin' the risk.

01:18:40.585 --> 01:18:43.414
You tryin' to make me
your collateral damage.

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:44.807
You don't know... Oh, man,

01:18:44.894 --> 01:18:46.504
you think
you're my collateral damage?

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.596
- All right, man. Just go, man.
- All right. No, no.

01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:53.816
- Yeah, all right. I will.
- All right, yeah.

01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:55.556
- Cool, bro. Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for your help.

01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:57.167
Appreciate that.

01:19:11.659 --> 01:19:12.791
I've been suspended.

01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:18.928
Did you fuck her?

01:19:19.015 --> 01:19:20.886
No.

01:19:20.973 --> 01:19:22.758
- Then what happened?

01:19:24.194 --> 01:19:26.065
She impressed me.
I gave her preference.

01:19:27.414 --> 01:19:29.242
She handed in the story,

01:19:29.329 --> 01:19:31.244
which I obviously
could not accept.

01:19:31.331 --> 01:19:33.246
Her feelings got hurt,
and she lashed out.

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.118
- That's how I understand it.
- Hm.

01:19:35.205 --> 01:19:36.467
So you flirted with her,

01:19:36.554 --> 01:19:37.729
- and then, you rejected her.
No,

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:38.774
- it wasn't flirting.
- What was it then?

01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:40.210
- It was affection!

01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:44.388
Well, are you
attracted to her?

01:19:48.958 --> 01:19:49.959
I'll tell you.

01:19:51.395 --> 01:19:54.833
This is about a girl
who flattered you,

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.530
who read your little book,

01:19:56.617 --> 01:19:58.881
and your inevitable surrender
to adulation.

01:19:58.968 --> 01:20:01.579
You fucking fell for it.

01:20:01.666 --> 01:20:03.929
Finally. Finally!

01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:07.106
Someone gave your reductive
short stories a second glance.

01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:08.978
And you can't help
but get hard for it

01:20:09.065 --> 01:20:10.414
because, what, now suddenly

01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:12.024
you feel worth somethin',
is that it?

01:20:12.111 --> 01:20:13.156
Yes!

01:20:13.243 --> 01:20:16.333
She made me feel
worth something.

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:17.508
What does that tell you?

01:20:19.423 --> 01:20:23.383
Was it her sycophancy
that got you hard?

01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:25.777
Or was it the smell
of teen spirit?

01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:27.561
- Fuck you.
- Oh, be my guest.

01:20:27.648 --> 01:20:29.825
Stop.

01:20:29.912 --> 01:20:31.609
- Did you?
- No, I didn't fuck her.

01:20:31.696 --> 01:20:32.828
Why do you look so guilty?

01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:34.003
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:37.180
- Oh, didn't you?

01:20:41.314 --> 01:20:43.490
God, I'm in hell.

01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:46.058
Well, make yourself at home.

01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:47.799
Why are you so punishing?

01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:49.583
You wanted her.

01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:51.542
I can read it all
in your face.

01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:52.891
How can you see anything
in this state,

01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:54.501
you fuckin' alcoholic?

01:20:56.373 --> 01:20:58.766
It's the only thing
that makes you bearable, baby.

01:21:00.507 --> 01:21:01.682
You are a cunt.

01:21:01.769 --> 01:21:03.249
And you're a liar.

01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:05.121
Liar!

01:21:06.774 --> 01:21:09.386
You're the banner boy
for mediocrity,

01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:11.867
waving your flag
of spotless virtue

01:21:11.954 --> 01:21:15.087
like some middling
American hero.

01:21:15.174 --> 01:21:17.220
But, Jon, baby...

01:21:18.525 --> 01:21:20.440
you're the villain.

01:21:25.228 --> 01:21:27.447
But you can't even see that,
can you?

01:21:42.549 --> 01:21:43.986
Don't you worry for me at all?

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.554
What would I possibly
worry about

01:21:47.641 --> 01:21:49.034
other than dying of boredom

01:21:49.121 --> 01:21:51.428
having to listen to
your inventions of conflict?

01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:55.214
You...

01:21:56.172 --> 01:21:57.173
are...

01:21:58.783 --> 01:21:59.827
vile.

01:22:06.356 --> 01:22:08.053
Why don't you write about it?

01:22:35.341 --> 01:22:36.516
Spit it out, Winnie.

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:39.258
What are you doing?

01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:42.740
I'm completing
my admissions essay.

01:22:44.916 --> 01:22:46.439
Is that all?

01:22:46.526 --> 01:22:47.832
Well, I'm smokin' a cigarette,

01:22:49.312 --> 01:22:51.357
if you wish to be
very literal.

01:22:51.444 --> 01:22:53.490
What are you doin'
to Mr. Miller?

01:23:04.022 --> 01:23:06.590
I'm testifyin' against him
in front of the school board.

01:23:06.677 --> 01:23:08.766
- Why?
- He underestimated me.

01:23:09.767 --> 01:23:11.160
I overestimated him.

01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:13.423
Are you okay?

01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:14.641
I'm inspired.

01:23:16.817 --> 01:23:18.515
- That's not funny.
- It is.

01:23:19.342 --> 01:23:20.778
A little.

01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:23.563
- Please don't do this.
- Why?

01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:27.480
You're gonna ruin his life.

01:23:28.177 --> 01:23:29.221
And for what?

01:23:33.312 --> 01:23:35.053
To avenge your rejection?

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:38.970
To punish him?

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.409
Because
he didn't wanna fuck you?

01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:45.368
He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.

01:23:45.455 --> 01:23:47.109
Yes.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.114
But he didn't leave his wife
for you.

01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:57.467
I'll testify against you.

01:23:57.554 --> 01:23:58.598
No, you won't.

01:24:00.339 --> 01:24:01.949
Excuse me?

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.300
I'll show them the evidence
I have against you and Boris.

01:24:05.953 --> 01:24:07.912
And not only will your
credibility be shot to shit,

01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:09.392
but you'll incriminate him
as well.

01:24:11.916 --> 01:24:14.571
Two teachers
can lose their jobs.

01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:20.098
Oh, hey,
maybe we can double team.

01:24:21.099 --> 01:24:22.753
You played me.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.189
You knew what we were doing.

01:24:24.929 --> 01:24:26.148
This is not what I meant.

01:24:26.235 --> 01:24:27.279
Isn't it, though?

01:24:33.024 --> 01:24:35.592
Didn't I play it out
exactly like you imagined?

01:24:35.679 --> 01:24:38.073
This isn't a fucking game,
Cairo.

01:24:39.857 --> 01:24:40.901
You're right.

01:24:44.949 --> 01:24:47.517
This is, to date,

01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:51.564
my greatest achievement.

01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:09.016
"In the end,

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.673
"ultimately, I understood

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.894

"and rendered us defeated,
