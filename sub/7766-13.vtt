00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
- Stassi texts me this morning.
- Oh, my God.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.000
- "I can't even begin to express

00:18.999 --> 00:20.000
how happy it makes me
to hear about your engagement."

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
I don't want anything
to do with her.

00:22.999 --> 00:25.999
- Max fainted, hit a TV,
and a piece of wood.

00:25.999 --> 00:26.999
All of his teeth are f***ed up.

00:26.999 --> 00:28.999
- So he's not taking
his antibiotics?

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
- At 23 years of age.
- He's still a baby.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
- We are going to Waikiki.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.000
- I just heard about
the Hawaii trip

00:34.999 --> 00:35.999
and I just wanted know
where I stood.

00:35.999 --> 00:37.999
- If I say you can go,
I don't want to eat my words.

00:37.999 --> 00:38.999
- I'm just excited
to go back to Hawaii!

00:38.999 --> 00:39.999
- Shout-out to
the birthday boys

00:39.999 --> 00:40.999
for having us
and playing together.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.999
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

00:42.999 --> 00:43.999
- What's the situation
with Faith and Lala?

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
The goal is to get
them both in bed.

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
- He thinks that he's
getting laid on this trip.

00:47.999 --> 00:48.999
He's not.

00:48.999 --> 00:50.000
- My mom sent me screenshots

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
of the whole conversation
that her and Scheana had.

00:52.999 --> 00:53.999
- Are you f***ing kidding me?

00:53.999 --> 00:55.999
- He has this attitude...
- He's a lot of us--

00:55.999 --> 00:56.999
- And he's better
than everything.

00:56.999 --> 00:58.999
- Does the truth hurt?
- No, no ,no, no.

00:58.999 --> 01:00.999
- Jax is a very smooth talker.

01:00.999 --> 01:03.999
Brittany deserves
to know the truth.

01:03.999 --> 01:05.999
That night, he was telling me
he was gonna f*** me.

01:06.999 --> 01:08.999
- I never said that.
- Hello, be honest!

01:08.999 --> 01:11.999
- I did not say that.

01:15.999 --> 01:19.999
- ♪ You know
that it's our time ♪

01:19.999 --> 01:22.999
♪ These are the best days ♪

01:22.999 --> 01:24.999
♪ Of our lives ♪

01:24.999 --> 01:28.999
♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:28.999 --> 01:33.999
♪ This one's
for you tonight ♪

01:40.999 --> 01:41.999
- Just trust me.

01:41.999 --> 01:42.999
I'm not being disgusting
when I say this,

01:42.999 --> 01:46.999
if I wanted to have sex
with her, I would have.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.999
So if you want to buy
in to that, that's fine.

01:48.999 --> 01:49.999
I'm not--
- Who'll say,

01:49.999 --> 01:50.999
"If you want to buy in
to that, that's fine?"

01:50.999 --> 01:52.999
It's not fine.
None of this is fine.

01:52.999 --> 01:54.999
- Okay, I understand.

01:54.999 --> 01:55.999
I definitely chose Brittany

01:55.999 --> 01:57.999
because I love Brittany
and I wanted to be with her,

01:57.999 --> 02:00.999
but there was a moment of
weakness where I thought about

02:00.999 --> 02:04.999
maybe partaking in some kind of
sexual activity with Lala.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
- Okay, I swear to God--

02:06.999 --> 02:08.999
- I mean, they're just thoughts.

02:08.999 --> 02:09.999
Did I used to be a liar?
Absolutely.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.000
Did I used to cheat on Stassi?
Yes, I did.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.999
- I think that you have
sent mixed signals.

02:14.999 --> 02:15.999
You have been a little
flirty back.

02:15.999 --> 02:18.999
- Okay, anyway, I--you know,
we can go in circles all night,

02:18.999 --> 02:19.999
I'd like to go drink some more
drinks at the pool, shall we?

02:19.999 --> 02:21.999
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

02:21.999 --> 02:22.999
- Like, are we all right?
- Let's go skinny-dipping.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.999
- Are we gonna get through this?
- I just want you to be honest

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
with me always, okay?

02:28.999 --> 02:29.999
Okay?

02:29.999 --> 02:31.000
- Yes.

02:37.999 --> 02:39.999
- May I make one suggestion?

02:39.999 --> 02:40.999
Birthday boys go first.
- All right, yeah, let's do it.

02:40.999 --> 02:42.999
- All right, all right.
- Oh!

02:42.999 --> 02:44.999
- You got to pack your basics
when going to Hawaii.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.999
- See, this is a true leader.
He leads by example.

02:46.999 --> 02:50.000
- You need, maybe, some
snorkel gear, swim trunks,

02:50.000 --> 02:51.999
and of course a beer bong.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
- Inch, inch, inch.

02:53.999 --> 02:54.999
- Oh, my God.

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
Peter, Peter.

02:56.999 --> 02:57.999
- Cheers, I guess.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.999
- Where's Lala at?

03:01.999 --> 03:02.999
- I don't know.

03:02.999 --> 03:03.999
Little bitch.

03:04.999 --> 03:07.999
- I'm gonna go find Lala.
- I want to come with you.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
Hey, girly girl.

03:15.999 --> 03:16.999
I was just
checking on you, babe.

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
Make sure you're okay.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
- Well, whatever--Faith.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.000
I mean, here's the thing, babe.

03:21.999 --> 03:24.999
You were just as naked
as I was today.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.999
I've been put on blast for that.

03:27.999 --> 03:28.999
- You feel like I always
have an issue with you,

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
well, it's not gonna
get much better

03:30.999 --> 03:33.999
if you're taking your top off
in front of my fiancé.

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
- I've been put on blast
for everything.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
- You told me you
respect relationships.

03:37.999 --> 03:39.999
- Are you really gonna
turn this on me?

03:39.999 --> 03:43.999
- Hey, what is wrong?

03:49.999 --> 03:50.999
Hey, what's wrong?

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
- It's not fair.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.999
- I'm not someone that
you could easily crack,

03:55.999 --> 03:57.999
but I have hit my breaking point

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
and I just want to get away
from everybody.

03:59.999 --> 04:01.999
When you have
a bunch of people, like,

04:01.999 --> 04:04.999
questioning your
character and, like,

04:04.999 --> 04:05.999
whether you respect
yourself or not.

04:05.999 --> 04:08.999
It's like, I haven't spread
my legs for anybody.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
I've been nothing but honest,

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
so to look at Jax and be like,

04:11.999 --> 04:12.999
"Look me in my damn eyes

04:12.999 --> 04:14.999
and tell me that you didn't
say that sh**."

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
And he can actually do that?

04:16.999 --> 04:18.999
Look me dead in my f***ing eyes.
- I never said that.

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
- You're a good liar.
- I never said that.

04:20.999 --> 04:21.999
- This how serial
killers operate.

04:21.999 --> 04:22.999
- Yeah.

04:22.999 --> 04:25.999
- Jax cares about Jax.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
I don't think he is processing

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
the hurt that
he's causing anybody.

04:30.999 --> 04:32.999
Let's go night-night, can we?

04:32.999 --> 04:34.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:34.999 --> 04:37.999
- Yeah, I'm gonna take these off
'cause they're kind of wet.

04:37.999 --> 04:42.999
- James, I had
a rough night with--

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
- What? I'm not doing anything.

04:44.999 --> 04:47.999
God, you're such
a pain in the ass sometimes.

04:47.999 --> 04:50.999
- You're so annoying.
- No, you're just a tease, babe.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.999
- Faith, I would love
for you to get in my bed.

04:53.999 --> 04:54.999
James, get out of my bad.

04:54.999 --> 04:55.999
- No, no, whatever dude.
- James.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
- I'm done playing games
with you, babe.

04:57.999 --> 04:58.999
- What are you talking about?
- You're more concerned

04:58.999 --> 04:59.999
talking to Jax a little--

04:59.999 --> 05:01.999
- Shut up.
- Oh, when did I talk to Jax...

05:01.999 --> 05:02.999
- All right, whatever.
- Unless I bitch him out.

05:02.999 --> 05:04.999
- Hey, relax.
- I've been nothing...

05:04.999 --> 05:05.999
- I'm bored! Good night!
- But the best.

05:05.999 --> 05:08.000
- Good night! Good night!
I'm not talking to you tonight.

05:08.999 --> 05:10.999
- Oy, f***ing bullsh**, man.

05:10.999 --> 05:12.999
- James is out of his damn mind.

05:18.999 --> 05:21.000
- I thought about it.
- You're so cute.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.999
- God, ew, you licked
my ear, dude.

05:22.999 --> 05:23.999
- No, stop.
- Chill.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.999
- I just want to say he's cute.
- I'm having a moment.

05:25.999 --> 05:26.999
- You just ruined our moment.
- I'm sorry.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
- This is a fiancée moment.
- Can I talk to you

05:28.999 --> 05:29.999
for a second?

05:29.999 --> 05:31.999
Even though I don't genuinely

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
feel sorry for
everything I said,

05:33.999 --> 05:34.999
I would rather just, you know,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.999
put a Band-Aid on it,
close it up, and apologize.

05:38.999 --> 05:43.999
First, I just want to say
that I'm very sorry

05:43.999 --> 05:46.999
if that conversation was
inappropriate or out of line.

05:46.999 --> 05:49.999
- Scheana, it feels like
a backhanded apology.

05:49.999 --> 05:52.999
Tom wants--
- What, he wants me to say...

05:52.999 --> 05:54.999
- If--he wants you to say...
- "I'm sorry that I said that?"

05:54.999 --> 05:59.999
- "I'm sorry that I did that."
- I'm standing by what I said.

05:59.999 --> 06:00.999
I do think he's acted
that way before,

06:00.999 --> 06:02.999
and I think it's rubbed off
the wrong way on you.

06:02.999 --> 06:05.999
- Scheana doesn't have remorse
about anything that she did

06:05.999 --> 06:09.999
because, apparently,
Scheana's too big to fail.

06:09.999 --> 06:12.999
I can't really trust
where you're coming from.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.999
God, I just wish you could
actually mean it.

06:14.999 --> 06:15.999
- I did mean what I said.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
I clearly didn't
like his attitude.

06:17.999 --> 06:19.999
I'm sorry that you guys
had to see that,

06:19.999 --> 06:22.999
but that's what I had to say.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
If I would've lied
or exaggerated something

06:24.999 --> 06:26.999
in those texts, then yeah,
I would have felt bad,

06:26.999 --> 06:28.999
but if you don't want
to be called cocky

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
then don't act like it.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.999
- My feelings were hurt.
His feelings were hurt.

06:33.999 --> 06:36.999
- And that's why
I'm apologizing.

06:36.999 --> 06:38.999
- Okay.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
- I don't even like beer.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
- Stop with your tongue.
Stop with your tongue.

06:47.999 --> 06:48.999
- Look at that.

06:48.999 --> 06:49.999
I think we should get
married right now.

06:49.999 --> 06:52.999
God, I knew I loved her.

06:52.999 --> 06:54.999
- Jesus Christ.

06:54.999 --> 06:57.999
- Oh, my God, we got
bottle service, dude.

07:00.999 --> 07:03.999
Scheana, what's wrong?

07:03.999 --> 07:05.999
What?

07:05.999 --> 07:08.999
How the f*** do you know?

07:08.999 --> 07:10.999
- Shay and I are still
working on rebuilding trust,

07:10.999 --> 07:14.999
so sneaking drinks behind
my back isn't helping.

07:18.999 --> 07:21.999
- I'm not. Dude, seriously,
you're pissing me off right now.

07:21.999 --> 07:22.999
Oh, my God.

07:24.999 --> 07:25.999
- I don't care
about everyone else.

07:25.999 --> 07:27.999
Am I'm married
to anyone else? No.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- Then guess what?
Then you go and I'm gonna go

07:29.999 --> 07:31.999
back to our room and go to bed.

07:31.999 --> 07:34.999
- I need my rock, like,
I need someone to talk to

07:34.999 --> 07:36.999
about what just happened
with Ariana and I,

07:36.999 --> 07:39.999
but if I have a drunk husband,
he can't be that person to me.

07:41.999 --> 07:44.999
8th floor.

07:57.999 --> 08:01.999
- All right, here comes
the worst thing ever.

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
- I love you.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.999
- Day eight since
the engagement,

08:12.999 --> 08:14.999
still no fiancée sex.

08:14.999 --> 08:16.999
I feel the pressure
mounting and I'm like,

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
"We got to do this.

08:17.999 --> 08:20.999
We got to consummate
this goddamn engagement."

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
- I'm just really disappointed.

08:26.999 --> 08:29.999
Scheana took it
upon herself to just

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
talk a bunch of sh** about me.

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
That's kind of f***ed up.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
Scheana doesn't
quite understand

08:35.999 --> 08:36.999
how devastating this is.

08:36.999 --> 08:38.999
I mean, she's basically
just put herself

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
in the same realm as Kristen.

08:40.999 --> 08:44.999
They both have lied
and schemed behind my back

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
to try and break up
my relationship.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
She tried to project her own

08:48.999 --> 08:51.999
relationship insecurities
onto us.

08:51.999 --> 08:52.999
She should have been, like,

08:52.999 --> 08:54.999
focusing on her
own relationship,

08:54.999 --> 08:58.999
which now come to find out
was actually deteriorating.

08:58.999 --> 08:59.999
- Sorry for being
a bitch last night.

08:59.999 --> 09:03.999
I just felt like you just
were not listening to me.

09:03.999 --> 09:06.999
- Yes I was, but you
weren't listening to me.

09:06.999 --> 09:07.999
You were like, "Oh, you're
wasted, you're wasted."

09:07.999 --> 09:08.999
I was like, "No, I'm not."

09:08.999 --> 09:11.999
- Well, I can tell when you've
drank a little too much

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
'cause you get a look in your
eyes and you get an attitude.

09:13.999 --> 09:16.999
That was, like, the trigger
that like upset me because--

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
- I was fine until
you started bringing it up.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
- Dude, what?
Seriously?

09:19.999 --> 09:22.999
- We'll just agree
to disagree on that so...

09:22.999 --> 09:24.999
- I'm just saying, if something
bothers me that much,

09:24.999 --> 09:27.999
I would think maybe
you wouldn't do it anymore.

09:27.999 --> 09:28.999
First day in this trip

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
was supposed to be
about moderation.

09:30.999 --> 09:34.000
Have a few drinks,
get buzzed, have fun, be normal.

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
Unfortunately,
it hasn't happened that way.

09:36.999 --> 09:39.999
I talked to Ariana.

09:39.999 --> 09:42.999
I just said, "I'm sorry, sorry,
sorry, etcetera, etcetera,"

09:42.999 --> 09:44.999
which is really difficult
for me to do

09:44.999 --> 09:46.999
because I don't think
I was wrong,

09:46.999 --> 09:50.999
but if it's easier, then I'm
just gonna f***ing say it.

09:50.999 --> 09:51.999
- At the end of the day,

09:51.999 --> 09:54.999
I know who my real, real,
real, real friends are.

09:54.999 --> 09:56.999
- Unfortunately, you have
to be the bigger person,

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
which you always are.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
- f***, it means cocky ass****.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
- Coming up...

10:17.999 --> 10:20.999
- ♪ Hey, hello, hello, hello
Let's get going ♪

10:20.999 --> 10:21.999
♪ I don't want to
waste a single moment ♪

10:25.000 --> 10:26.999
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪

10:29.999 --> 10:34.999
♪ Any time's the time
I want to be with you ♪

10:37.999 --> 10:39.999
- Hey, mom.

10:39.999 --> 10:40.999
I just woke up.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.999
But it's 20 past 10:00.

10:42.999 --> 10:45.999
- Yeah I know, I had
a late night last night.

10:45.999 --> 10:46.999
- Is James there?

10:46.999 --> 10:48.999
Is Max behaving himself?

10:48.999 --> 10:50.999
- I'll leave that
for him to answer.

10:50.999 --> 10:54.999
- Max, what were you doing?

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
- James, I'm holding you
personally responsible

11:01.000 --> 11:02.999
for Max's welfare,
do you hear me?

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
- Max, here we go, eh?
- Oh, God.

11:04.999 --> 11:05.999
- Cheers, yeah?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.999
- Is everybody behaving
themselves, James?

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
- Mm, not really.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
- Ask him if he's taken
his medicines--meds.

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
- Have you taken
your medication?

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
You're not supposed to drink
with antibiotics either.

11:14.999 --> 11:16.000
- Yeah, I know.

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
- And I don't want you kissing
anybody, just FYI.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.999
- What do you mean?

11:20.999 --> 11:21.999
- You cannot get an infection.

11:21.999 --> 11:24.999
Max has a mouthful
of wobbly teeth.

11:24.999 --> 11:26.999
He needs to be putting
that mouth nowhere,

11:26.999 --> 11:29.999
and I mean, nowhere.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.999
And I also don't want you
doing anything like surfing.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.999
- Unfortunately, we got to go--

11:33.999 --> 11:36.999
Max has a surfing lesson
in 15 minutes.

11:36.999 --> 11:39.999
- Well, I'm glad
you think it's so funny.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.999
Don't do anything silly, okay?
I love you.

11:41.999 --> 11:42.999
- Bye, Lisa.
- Bye.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.000
- Bye-bye, Mom.

11:44.999 --> 11:45.000
- Ugh.

11:46.999 --> 11:47.999
- This is paradise.

11:47.999 --> 11:48.999
- It's not too shabby.

11:53.999 --> 11:56.999
- I can look phenomenal
on the sand,

11:56.999 --> 12:01.999
but getting in that water, it's
gonna be whole different story.

12:01.999 --> 12:02.999
Can I do this out there?

12:02.999 --> 12:04.999
- Maybe we should
go on one of those.

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
- Sunscreen?
- This is the type of

12:06.999 --> 12:07.999
suntan lotion
that you drink, actually,

12:07.999 --> 12:09.999
and it works from
the inside out

12:09.999 --> 12:10.999
'cause that's matters
the most, right?

12:10.999 --> 12:11.999
- Ooh.
- What's inside.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
- That's tequila.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.999
- Oh, my God.
- One time, whenever

12:15.999 --> 12:17.999
I was growing up, I did it
in a perfume bottle

12:17.999 --> 12:20.999
and the alcohol tasted
just like perfume.

12:20.999 --> 12:21.999
- Really?

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
- I'm gonna go surf some waves.

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
What do you think?
- Hang ten, bro.

12:27.999 --> 12:29.999
- I'm scared for them.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
- Hey, Jax...

12:39.999 --> 12:41.999
- Never surfed
a day in my life,

12:41.999 --> 12:42.999
but I've always really
wanted to try it.

12:42.999 --> 12:44.999
So to be riding the wave,

12:44.999 --> 12:46.999
f*** yeah,
I'm balling at this sh**.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.999
- Lala, you're missing
your bottoms.

13:11.999 --> 13:12.999
- It's National Naked Day,
though, girl.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.999
- That's underwear.
- It's a swimsuit.

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
- That's like what the girls
in the rap videos wear.

13:17.999 --> 13:18.999
- Oh, that was
a huge compliment.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.999
I mean, I take champagne on
the booty anywhere I go, girl.

13:21.999 --> 13:23.999
- Vulgar as f***.
- Me?

13:23.999 --> 13:25.999
- Yes.
- I know.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
- Yesterday, Lala
decides to go topless

13:27.999 --> 13:31.999
in front of a bunch
of couples and today,

13:31.999 --> 13:33.999
she decides
it's a better idea to show up

13:33.999 --> 13:36.999
in the world's tiniest
thong bikini.

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
- If you need to borrow the rest
of your bathing suit,

13:38.999 --> 13:40.999
I have it right here.

13:40.999 --> 13:42.999
She's like that bird flying
into the window

13:42.999 --> 13:43.999
over and over again.

13:43.999 --> 13:44.999
Like, I feel bad for her.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
I was only there
for the tail end

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
of the conversation last night,
but you left really upset.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.999
- Yep.
- So I don't know what it was

13:50.999 --> 13:52.999
that, like, made you cry.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
- The problem that I'm having is

13:54.999 --> 13:57.999
this just--
this is who I am.

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
So to have people talking to me

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
the way I was
spoken to last night

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
was absolutely not okay.

14:03.999 --> 14:04.999
- I've been in your position.

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
I've been the new girl at Sur.

14:06.999 --> 14:09.999
I've been the girl who
everyone thinks is a slut.

14:09.999 --> 14:12.999
I've been the girl who slept
with the married guy

14:12.999 --> 14:13.999
when I didn't know
he was married,

14:13.999 --> 14:14.999
but I've grown from that.

14:14.999 --> 14:17.999
I've redeemed myself in a lot
of the negative things

14:17.999 --> 14:19.999
that people used to think
and say about me.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.999
- I like, I--
it makes my blood boil.

14:21.999 --> 14:25.999
I think because I've been so
f***ing genuine to everybody

14:26.000 --> 14:27.999
and I just can't win.

14:27.999 --> 14:28.999
- I know the feeling, trust me.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.999
Like, I've--I've been there.
I get it.

14:31.999 --> 14:35.000
Just a group of people have
me cry many times, so...

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
- Hello, hello, hello, hello.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.999
- We're matching.
- We're matchy, matchy.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.999
- You look so cute!
- Thank you.

15:01.999 --> 15:03.999
- You wore high heels to my
house--I feel really special.

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
- Listen, when you don't have
your sh** together,

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
you have to dress...

15:07.999 --> 15:08.999
- Improvise.
- Like you do.

15:08.999 --> 15:12.999
- After Stassi found out
that I slept with Jax,

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
she backhanded me
and wrote me off.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
- You're a dirty f***ing whore.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.999
- f*** you.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
- You are disgusting!
- Oh, you--

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
- It's really cute, Kristen.

15:22.999 --> 15:23.999
Hey, remember when you
used to live

15:23.999 --> 15:26.999
in that really dingy,
sh**ty apartment?

15:26.999 --> 15:27.999
- Where Tom and Ariana...

15:27.999 --> 15:28.999
- Thank you.
- Have to live?

15:28.999 --> 15:29.999
- That's disgusting.

15:29.999 --> 15:32.999
- For a while, I thought
our friendship was dead

15:32.999 --> 15:36.999
but then I just started
to reach out little by little

15:36.999 --> 15:39.999
and she was receptive to it.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
I went on my first date ever.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
You remember Kevin,
Jax's old friend, like...

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
- Yeah, right, yeah.
- That he grew up with?

15:44.999 --> 15:47.999
Uh-huh, he's actually
in L.A. for work.

15:47.999 --> 15:50.999
He lives in Austin,
so he--he was like,

15:50.999 --> 15:51.999
"Oh, do you want to hang out,"
and I was like, "Yeah."

15:51.999 --> 15:52.999
- And then you guys had sex.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
- And, I mean,
we, like, had fun.

15:54.999 --> 15:56.999
- Play the motherf***ing field.
- Yeah!

15:56.999 --> 15:59.999
- So yeah, what's going on
with you and Patrick right now?

15:59.999 --> 16:01.999
- Ugh, f***, we're just
trying to figure it out.

16:01.999 --> 16:04.999
We decided to live apart 'cause
it's like, we got to this point,

16:04.999 --> 16:09.999
like, in our relationship where
it was just like roommates.

16:09.999 --> 16:11.000
There's a lot of sh**
going on my life,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.999
especially with Patrick.

16:12.999 --> 16:15.999
We went from
a long-distance relationship

16:15.999 --> 16:18.000
to living with each other for
a little while in New York

16:18.000 --> 16:20.999
to then living
with each other in L.A..

16:20.999 --> 16:25.999
It's was like we went from zero
to old married couple overnight.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
We're barely, like, having sex.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.999
We were, like, barely speaking
to each other, like...

16:29.999 --> 16:31.999
- You just had your routine.
- And it was just like,

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
something needs to change.

16:32.999 --> 16:35.999
- I get that,
my only concern is that

16:35.999 --> 16:39.999
it's, like, an excuse
to, like, break up

16:39.999 --> 16:41.999
without having
the balls to break up.

16:41.999 --> 16:45.999
- Stassi is slowly
rolling down the mountain

16:45.999 --> 16:47.999
head over feet.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
She's on her way to rock bottom

16:49.999 --> 16:52.000
and this is kind of her fault.

16:52.999 --> 16:53.999
- I felt like I was
codependent a little bit...

16:53.999 --> 16:55.999
- A lot.
- On Patrick

16:55.999 --> 16:58.999
and I just don't f***ing
feel like fighting...

16:59.000 --> 17:00.999
- Yeah.
- Anymore with anyone.

17:00.999 --> 17:03.999
For two years, I've invested
so much in Patrick,

17:03.999 --> 17:06.999
that now, I'm realizing
that I've compromised

17:06.999 --> 17:08.999
a lot of my friendships

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
and I handled things poorly,

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
but I don't feel like
it's completely my fault.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.999
And that's another reason
I want to rectify, like,

17:16.999 --> 17:19.999
things that I--
I shouldn't have done,

17:19.999 --> 17:21.999
like, last year and like--

17:21.999 --> 17:23.000
- Katie.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.000
- I mean, like,
the whole Katie thing

17:25.999 --> 17:27.999
is it's--
it's super complicated.

17:27.999 --> 17:30.999
It's more complicated
than my actual relationship

17:30.999 --> 17:35.999
because the whole sex tape
thing, like, shook my world.

17:35.999 --> 17:36.999
After I broke up with Jax,

17:36.999 --> 17:39.999
I started dating
this guy who I hear

17:39.999 --> 17:43.999
that he's showing tons of people

17:43.999 --> 17:47.999
a video of myself alone

17:47.999 --> 17:48.999
touching myself.

17:48.999 --> 17:49.999
- Like, Scheana was wrong.

17:49.999 --> 17:51.999
I know for a fact that
she showed it to people.

17:51.999 --> 17:54.999
I know that she laughed about it
and that's f***ing okay.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
- Katie knew how hurt
I was by Scheana.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
She knew how devastated I was.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
It's a big deal when
you're going to Miami

18:00.999 --> 18:03.999
with the person who just
showed my sex tape to everybody.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.999
- Makes my life so happy.
- I love you--

18:07.999 --> 18:10.999
- One thing I've really
learned about myself

18:10.999 --> 18:14.999
is that I have a great ability
to just cut people out.

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
I'm just hoping that she
could take ownership for that.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.999
- Yeah.

18:18.999 --> 18:21.999
- I mean, I regret cutting
her out so quickly.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.999
- Especially now that...
- I just--this is the thing...

18:23.999 --> 18:25.999
- They're engaged.
- Kristen, I started crying.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.999
I was with my mom up
in Lake Arrowhead

18:27.999 --> 18:29.999
and I was like,
"I was supposed to be there."

18:29.999 --> 18:30.999
- Oh.

18:32.999 --> 18:33.999
- Coming up...

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
- She's f***ing a pathetic loser

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
who has no friends,
no job, no money.

18:37.999 --> 18:41.000
- I just want her to stay as
far away from me as possible.

18:54.999 --> 18:55.999
- Oh, it's beautiful out here.

18:55.999 --> 18:57.999
- Oh, I know.
Have some tea.

18:57.999 --> 18:59.000
Tea, tea.
- Hmm? I don't know, Ken.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.999
I'm worried.
- About?

19:00.999 --> 19:01.999
- What do you mean, "About?"

19:01.999 --> 19:02.999
- About our son...

19:02.999 --> 19:04.999
- Oh, about that, yeah.
About the phone call.

19:04.999 --> 19:07.999
- Really, he's got one chance
at this with his teeth,

19:07.999 --> 19:09.999
of them being okay again.

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
I mean, he could get
a serious infection.

19:11.999 --> 19:12.999
- Max will be okay
as long as

19:12.999 --> 19:14.999
he doesn't drink too much,
it will--

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
- Well, that's exactly my point.

19:16.999 --> 19:17.999
Pandora has been a dream

19:17.999 --> 19:19.999
and Max has been naughty,

19:19.999 --> 19:21.999
so it's so difficult for me,
as a mother, to detach.

19:21.999 --> 19:23.999
So what do we do just...
- I don't think--

19:23.999 --> 19:26.999
- Sit here and just pray
and hope that he's okay...

19:26.999 --> 19:28.999
Or should I call him again?

19:28.999 --> 19:31.000
- I wouldn't call him,
but you won't take my advice.

19:31.999 --> 19:32.999
- Ugh.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.999
I want Max to make
the right choices.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.999
I want him to make
the right decisions,

19:37.999 --> 19:40.999
as long as they're my choices
and my decisions.

19:40.999 --> 19:41.999
Sorry.

19:41.999 --> 19:42.999
Can I just stay here

19:42.999 --> 19:45.999
and just pretend none
of this is happening?

19:45.999 --> 19:46.999
Do I have to go to work?

19:46.999 --> 19:49.999
- Oh, probably not.
Have the day off.

19:49.999 --> 19:50.999
- Can I just have
like an hour?

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
- Is that comfortable there?

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
- It's perfect. It's bliss.

19:54.999 --> 19:58.999
Who'd ever thought a little girl
from England would end up here?

20:10.999 --> 20:11.999
- I don't know I feel
about Brittany

20:11.999 --> 20:13.999
being out there with Lala.

20:13.999 --> 20:14.999
Seeing everybody out
in that raft,

20:14.999 --> 20:15.999
I don't know how
I feel about that.

20:15.999 --> 20:17.999
- Why?

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
- Why do you think?

20:21.999 --> 20:22.999
- If there is a shark,
can we have,

20:22.999 --> 20:25.999
like, someone that we nominate
to be sacrificed?

20:25.999 --> 20:27.999
- We pointed at each other.

20:27.999 --> 20:28.999
- I love the ocean,

20:28.999 --> 20:31.999
but I'm afraid of sharks
eating me in the ocean,

20:31.999 --> 20:35.999
which is a very rational fear.

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
All right,
who's on shark patrol?

20:42.999 --> 20:43.999
- Hi, mister.

20:44.999 --> 20:45.999
- Yeah.

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
Lala is one of
the biggest teases

20:47.999 --> 20:48.999
I've ever met in my life.

20:48.999 --> 20:49.999
How do you want it, like, down?

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
She gives the sex eyes,

20:51.999 --> 20:52.999
but at the same, you know,

20:52.999 --> 20:54.000
I haven't seen
any of this action.

20:54.999 --> 20:56.999
I don't want to get
my shadow in it.

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
- Hey, so I got this text from
Kristen.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
She's having lunch
with Stassi.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
- What?

21:02.999 --> 21:03.999
- Clearly there's
something up, Schean.

21:03.999 --> 21:04.999
Unblocking
on social media.

21:04.999 --> 21:06.999
- She's f***ing a pathetic loser

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
who has no friends,
no job, no money.

21:08.999 --> 21:11.999
This girl doesn't
do things for other people.

21:11.999 --> 21:14.999
She's out for herself
and she's using Kristen.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.999
I'm very curious to see
what she's using her for.

21:16.999 --> 21:17.999
- She walks away
from my friendship.

21:17.999 --> 21:18.999
- And everyone.
- She said, "f*** you.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
"Bye, skeeze.

21:20.999 --> 21:21.999
You're a loser. I'm done."

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
- She's still that
little f***ing bitch.

21:23.999 --> 21:26.999
- I just want her to stay as
far away from me as possible.

21:26.999 --> 21:27.999
The f*** is going on?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.999
I don't want to be friends
with Stassi again.

21:29.999 --> 21:32.999
I don't want her working on
Kristen to try to get to me.

21:32.999 --> 21:33.999
I don't want them
talking about me.

21:33.999 --> 21:34.999
I don't want them
thinking about me,

21:34.999 --> 21:37.999
so whatever they're doing I hope
has nothing to do with me.

21:37.999 --> 21:38.999
- This is a game.
- She's just--

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
- I know what she's doing.
- She goes right to

21:40.999 --> 21:41.999
Jax's discard pile.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
- That's #JAXSDISCARDPILE.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.999
- We knew she'd come
crawling back.

21:47.999 --> 21:49.999
We just didn't know when.

21:49.999 --> 21:50.999
- Well--

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
It's not gonna work this time.

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999
- Yeah.

22:01.999 --> 22:02.999
- These pants suck.

22:02.999 --> 22:03.999
Every time I touch
the thing, they just burn.

22:04.999 --> 22:05.999
- I--look--put it on it

22:05.999 --> 22:07.999
for literally three seconds.

22:07.999 --> 22:08.999
Look, it's going away.

22:08.999 --> 22:09.999
Look, it's going away kind of.

22:09.999 --> 22:11.999
- You can't leave
an iron on pants at all.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
- Look, it's kind of...
- I don't care how many seconds.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
It's kind of going away.

22:15.999 --> 22:17.999
You want vodka cranberry
or vodka Red Bull?

22:17.999 --> 22:19.000
- It's gonna go...
- Or orange juice?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.999
- It's gonna be a long night,
so I'm gonna rock a Red Bull.

22:21.999 --> 22:23.999
Not to put a damper on this,
but I can't believe you sat

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
on a raft with Lala
after last night.

22:25.999 --> 22:26.999
- We didn't talk
about any drama.

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
We didn't talk about
any of the bullsh**.

22:28.999 --> 22:29.999
That's all I really
need right now.

22:29.999 --> 22:30.999
- I told you--
- It's not like we're

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
gonna be best friends
or anything.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
- Wait, you're not
gonna be best friends?

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
- No.
- That's a problem.

22:34.999 --> 22:35.999
- Why?
- I'm kidding, babe.

22:37.999 --> 22:38.999
- It's kind of like
every guys' dream

22:38.999 --> 22:41.999
to have a girl that just kind
of blows things like this off.

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
Any other girl
I would've dated,

22:43.999 --> 22:44.999
the trip would have been over,

22:44.999 --> 22:46.999
but with Brittany,
not the case,

22:46.999 --> 22:47.999
and that's what
I love about her.

22:47.999 --> 22:48.999
All right, let's get ready.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
- Okay.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
The drinks are kind of
strong, just to warn you.

22:52.999 --> 22:53.999
- Yeah, they are.

22:56.999 --> 22:57.999
- Can we dance tonight?

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
- No, I have to be
f***ed up to dance.

22:59.999 --> 23:00.999
That's how you know I'm drunk.
- That's the plan.

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
- I'm dancing tonight,
so I'll dance with you.

23:02.999 --> 23:03.999
- Thank you.

23:03.999 --> 23:04.999
- Hello!
- Hey!

23:04.999 --> 23:06.999
- Hey!
- Hi, guys.

23:06.999 --> 23:08.999
- How's it going?
- Look how pretty you look.

23:08.999 --> 23:10.999
- Max.
- "Weekend at Bernie's" style--

23:10.999 --> 23:11.999
- Max.
- Yeah.

23:11.999 --> 23:12.999
- What?
- How many fingers

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
am I holding up?

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
- f*** off.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.999
- Hey!
- Hey.

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
- Lala, I'm used to
you being half naked

23:19.999 --> 23:20.999
and now that you're this
clothed, I feel a little...

23:20.999 --> 23:21.999
- I know.
- Uncomfortable around you.

23:21.999 --> 23:22.999
Yes!

23:22.999 --> 23:25.999
- I've sort of adjusted
to you being half naked.

23:33.999 --> 23:34.999
- Buho.

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
- Thank you.

23:39.999 --> 23:40.999
- Welcome, you guys, to Buho.
Let you know a little bit--

23:40.999 --> 23:42.999
- Thank you.
- About what we do here.

23:42.999 --> 23:43.999
- Thanks for having us.
- 'Cause there are a lot

23:43.999 --> 23:47.999
of you guys, we would highly
our spiked watermelon bowl.

23:47.999 --> 23:50.999
So what it is it's about eight
or nine shots Patrón Silver,

23:50.999 --> 23:53.999
then about 4 1/2 shots
of Patrón Citrónge,

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
and then we do the blended
watermelon itself in about...

23:55.999 --> 23:56.999
- Yes, please.
- Maybe five.

23:57.999 --> 23:59.999
- Sold!

23:59.999 --> 24:00.999
- All right, thank you so much.

24:00.999 --> 24:01.999
- Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.

24:01.999 --> 24:03.999
- Thank you.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
- Oh, that's so hot.

24:05.999 --> 24:06.999
- Peter, you--
you guys understand,

24:06.999 --> 24:08.999
Brittany's the craziest,
freakiest girl I've ever dated.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.999
She honestly puts me to shame.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
- Uh, no--oh, my God.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.999
- I made love to
a turkey sandwich

24:14.999 --> 24:15.999
before I went to bed.

24:15.999 --> 24:17.999
- Ooh, that's so hot.
- It was so hot.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.999
Oh!

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
- Sh**.
- Oh, and you scoop it out?

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wait, I seriously want...

24:23.999 --> 24:24.999
- Oh wow, it's good.
- To put my face in there.

24:24.999 --> 24:27.999
- We're gonna be wasted
before our dinner gets here.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.999
- How money are these?
- Yeah, guys.

24:30.999 --> 24:32.999
- Yay.
- To all you guys.

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
- Whoo!
- Cheers!

24:33.999 --> 24:35.999
- I can't believe we only
had sex one time...

24:35.999 --> 24:36.999
- I know.
- On this trip.

24:36.999 --> 24:38.999
We haven't had sex no times.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
- When you're in Hawaii,
you got to have at least once.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
- James, how you doing
down there?

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
Have you guys had sex?

24:44.999 --> 24:47.000
- Don't tempt me,
don't tempt me.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.999
- James.

24:48.999 --> 24:49.999
- What?

24:49.999 --> 24:51.999
- Little known fact,

24:51.999 --> 24:53.999
James and I, before Hawaii,

24:53.999 --> 24:55.999
did attempt to sleep together.

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
We were hammered.

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
He couldn't get it up.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.999
He claims that I couldn't
get him hard, but--

25:03.999 --> 25:05.999
No, I just feel badly
about the whole thing

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
because I really
was having a lot of fun

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
and I did see something
with me and you,

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
but then there was
just a point where--

25:10.999 --> 25:13.999
and I think you know
what point that was--into it,

25:13.999 --> 25:15.999
it just wasn't clicking,
I guess.

25:15.999 --> 25:17.999
- I was way too drunk.

25:17.999 --> 25:18.999
The pressure was on

25:18.999 --> 25:20.000
and I f***ing choked.

25:20.999 --> 25:21.999
What do you want me to say?

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
It's not like you quit

25:22.999 --> 25:23.999
seeing someone after that.

25:23.999 --> 25:24.999
You just try again.

25:24.999 --> 25:28.999
- I don't want us
to not be friends.

25:28.999 --> 25:31.999
- Yeah.

25:31.999 --> 25:34.999
I mean, it's just
not gonna be the same.

25:34.999 --> 25:35.999
How could it be?

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
- I mean, you're cool
friends with Faith.

25:37.999 --> 25:38.999
You can't be that way with me?

25:38.999 --> 25:40.999
- I don't look at Faith
the way I look at you.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.999
I look at Faith as a friend
and, like, I love her,

25:42.999 --> 25:45.999
but I look at you way
differently that Faith.

25:45.999 --> 25:47.999
I mean, come on, you can't
compare the two like that.

25:47.999 --> 25:48.999
- The thing that's sh**ty
is that I really do

25:48.999 --> 25:50.999
love you and adore you and--

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
- Oh, it was kind of obvious
after last night.

25:52.999 --> 25:53.999
I mean...
- Well, yeah.

25:53.999 --> 25:54.999
- You like to f***,
I like to f***.

25:54.999 --> 25:56.999
We didn't f***.

25:56.999 --> 25:57.999
There's a reason why, right?

25:57.999 --> 25:58.999
- I don't even think
you would have remembered

25:58.999 --> 26:00.999
if we did.

26:00.999 --> 26:03.999
- All right.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
I'm over this conversation.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
- Yeah.

26:11.999 --> 26:14.999
I remain unapologetic.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
If you get whiskey dick,

26:16.999 --> 26:17.999
stick to vodka.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
I've never heard of anybody

26:19.999 --> 26:20.999
having vodka dick.

26:20.999 --> 26:22.000
I need to get drunk.

26:22.999 --> 26:23.999
- Coming up...

26:23.999 --> 26:24.999
- Can I tell you something?

26:24.999 --> 26:25.999
- What?

26:25.999 --> 26:26.999
- Since you just
brought up Kevin,

26:26.999 --> 26:30.999
I think he has
a serious girlfriend.

26:40.999 --> 26:41.999
- Are we gonna
get crazy tonight?

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
- Yeah, we're getting crazy.

26:43.999 --> 26:44.999
- Did you guys all have fun
at the beach today?

26:44.999 --> 26:46.999
- Yeah.
- You guys see any sharks?

26:46.999 --> 26:47.999
- Yeah, of course...
- So many.

26:47.999 --> 26:49.999
- Or orcas, actually.
- Did you know whale's vaginas

26:49.999 --> 26:50.999
are as big as a bus?

26:50.999 --> 26:52.999
- Okay, no.
- A bus?

26:52.999 --> 26:53.999
- No, they're not.
- They're like the big ones.

26:53.999 --> 26:56.999
The big ones?

26:56.999 --> 26:58.999
- Hey, Scheana.

26:58.999 --> 27:00.999
Do you want to talk
for a second?

27:06.999 --> 27:08.999
So yeah, obviously, you know,

27:08.999 --> 27:11.999
the other night,
conversation didn't go so well.

27:11.999 --> 27:14.999
- You guys have this "we're
better than everyone" attitude.

27:14.999 --> 27:15.999
You do!
- I do not have that.

27:15.999 --> 27:17.000
- I'm sorry.

27:17.999 --> 27:18.999
- No, no, no, no.
- Does the truth hurt?

27:18.999 --> 27:19.999
- And I kind of thought like
maybe it would be better

27:19.999 --> 27:23.999
if like, you know,
me and you just talked.

27:23.999 --> 27:25.999
When somebody asks if
Ariana's in a good place,

27:25.999 --> 27:29.999
you just say, "Yeah," because
Ariana was in a good place,

27:29.999 --> 27:32.999
and I feel like you're
self-aware enough to know

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
that that's a pretty much
a backstabbing thing to do.

27:34.999 --> 27:38.999
- And that's why I'm apologizing
over and over and over again.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.999
I've known Tom
for seven years now

27:41.999 --> 27:43.999
and he is so stubborn.

27:43.999 --> 27:46.999
I'm gonna just have to
take blame for everything.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
Say I was wrong
about everything,

27:48.999 --> 27:50.999
whether I mean or not.

27:50.999 --> 27:51.999
- That's not a real apology.

27:51.999 --> 27:53.999
- Because I didn't think
I needed to apologize

27:53.999 --> 27:55.999
for doing something
I don't regret.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
- You don't regret that?
- That's how I felt at the time.

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
- I've never acted like
I'm better than you, Scheana.

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
Ever, ever, ever.

28:01.999 --> 28:03.999
- Okay.
- Ever.

28:03.999 --> 28:06.999
- And again, I'm very
sorry for that.

28:06.999 --> 28:09.000
- What's going on between you
and Scheana, like a little--

28:09.999 --> 28:10.999
- Well, I just wanted to talk
to her about something

28:11.000 --> 28:13.999
that had upset me
and then it got to a point

28:13.999 --> 28:15.999
that I didn't want it to get to.

28:15.999 --> 28:17.999
- You told Ariana's mom

28:17.999 --> 28:18.999
pretty much that
I'm manipulative

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
and that like I'm selfish

28:21.000 --> 28:23.999
and that I only
look out for myself.

28:23.999 --> 28:24.999
I just don't--
- That is how I felt

28:24.999 --> 28:25.999
at the time.

28:25.999 --> 28:27.999
- You say that, but then like,

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
Shay's even expressed it.

28:29.999 --> 28:30.999
You know, he feels like

28:30.999 --> 28:32.999
you're very good
at convincing people

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
to get exactly what you want.

28:34.999 --> 28:38.999
That's basically the
definition of manipulating.

28:38.999 --> 28:41.999
When it comes
her marriage to Shay,

28:41.999 --> 28:43.999
I don't think Scheana
actually gets it,

28:43.999 --> 28:46.999
and she tries
to take over conversations,

28:46.999 --> 28:48.999
tries to tell people
what to do all the time.

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
It's really, like, her ego.

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
- He's the king
of just letting things go

28:52.999 --> 28:53.999
and not speaking up about them.

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
They're bothering him.

28:54.999 --> 28:57.999
- But he's also
intimidated by you.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
All these things
you're bringing up to me

28:59.999 --> 29:04.999
are very similar issues that,
like, you have with Shay.

29:04.999 --> 29:08.999
- Apparently, Sandoval is tired
of talking about his problems

29:08.999 --> 29:09.999
and wants to turn
this whole around

29:09.999 --> 29:12.000
about mine and Shay's problems,
which, by the way,

29:12.999 --> 29:13.999
are none of
your f***ing business.

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
- You've kind of had this, like,

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
"this is how it's gonna be"
kind of attitude.

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
- I don't agree.

29:19.999 --> 29:21.999
- It's one thing for Scheana

29:21.999 --> 29:22.999
to actually do what she did,

29:22.999 --> 29:25.999
but it's another thing
the way she's handled it.

29:25.999 --> 29:28.999
I mean, at this point
I'll be nice to Scheana,

29:28.999 --> 29:31.999
but I don't know
if we'll ever be the same.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
Look, I appreciate
you apologizing

29:33.999 --> 29:34.999
for the actual act
of doing that.

29:34.999 --> 29:37.999
Obviously, talk to Ariana's mom
if you're concerned,

29:37.999 --> 29:40.999
but just please try not to,
like, put your emotions into it.

29:40.999 --> 29:43.999
If you know what I mean,
like, please?

29:43.999 --> 29:45.999
- Deal.
- All right.

29:45.999 --> 29:47.999
- It's like that
brother-sister thing

29:47.999 --> 29:49.999
where you piss me off
and I annoy you.

29:49.999 --> 29:52.999
Yeah.

29:54.999 --> 29:55.999
- I just want...

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
Well--I just want to thank
everybody for being here.

29:57.999 --> 30:00.999
I know, we've had a couple
hiccups along the way,

30:00.999 --> 30:02.999
but I think it all worked out.

30:02.999 --> 30:03.999
I think we all had a great time.

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
It was a great birthday.

30:05.999 --> 30:06.999
We've had a great birthday week.
- Yeah, yeah.

30:06.999 --> 30:08.999
- Week or month, God,
right, you know?

30:08.999 --> 30:09.999
- Yeah.
- And--

30:09.999 --> 30:11.000
I hope everybody
enjoyed the trip.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.999
- Yeah!
- Let's this on a high note.

30:12.999 --> 30:13.999
- Ow!

30:13.999 --> 30:14.999
- Cheers, you guys!
- Cheers.

30:14.999 --> 30:16.999
Cheers!

30:27.999 --> 30:29.999
- Are you Periscoping?
- No.

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
- Thank God.
- I was looking at myself.

30:31.999 --> 30:32.999
- Oh, well,
you look really pretty.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.999
- I tried to go
to boxing this morning,

30:35.999 --> 30:39.999
and because you're not supposed
to work out 48 hours--

30:39.999 --> 30:41.999
After Botox.

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
- And the little like dots,
like, started--

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
the blood was coming out,
so I had to leave.

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
I'm so pissed.

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
- Hello, ladies, hi.
- Hi, how are you?

30:49.999 --> 30:50.999
- You've seen the menu?
- No, thank you so much.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.999
- Sure, did you guys need some
time to look or do you want...

30:53.999 --> 30:54.999
- I can be...
- To go order some drinks?

30:54.999 --> 30:55.999
- I can do this right now.
- Okay, perfect.

30:55.999 --> 30:57.999
- Let's do...
- We're gonna do vodka soda.

30:57.999 --> 30:59.999
- Vodka gimlet.
- On the rocks.

30:59.999 --> 31:00.999
- On the rocks.
- And another vodka soda?

31:00.999 --> 31:01.999
- Oh, thanks, thank you.

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
She already knows
my drink order.

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
Feel like I'm at home.

31:05.999 --> 31:08.999
- You picked a really fun joint.

31:08.999 --> 31:09.999
- Scheana actually called me

31:09.999 --> 31:10.999
from Hawaii today.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.999
- Really?
- Yeah. I guess, well,

31:12.999 --> 31:14.999
you know Tom and Ariana,
the whole reason

31:14.999 --> 31:15.999
they didn't want me to go
because like,

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
"Kristen's gonna be drama.
We don't want her here,

31:17.999 --> 31:20.999
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"
and guess who is drama?

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
Tom and Ariana.
- What did they do?

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
- Scheana and Ariana
got in a fight

31:24.999 --> 31:28.999
because Scheana called
Tom cocky or something.

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
Wow, big deal.
Ariana like explodes.

31:30.999 --> 31:31.999
It's what she does.

31:31.999 --> 31:34.999
I have gotten over
the Hawaii thing.

31:34.999 --> 31:38.999
I'm over here and Tom and Ariana
are as far away as possible.

31:38.999 --> 31:39.999
- Like, what's
the point of like having

31:39.999 --> 31:41.999
all of this animosity
and this negativity.

31:41.999 --> 31:44.999
It's like, I was, you know,

31:44.999 --> 31:45.999
just like Katie
said last year like...

31:45.999 --> 31:46.999
"I want to let go

31:46.999 --> 31:47.999
of all of the negativity."

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
- Yeah.
- Kevin just texted me.

31:49.999 --> 31:50.999
- Is he coming?

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
- Yeah.
- Okay, um...

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
- Actually, I'm calling
an Uber really fast...

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
- You're calling him an Uber?

31:56.999 --> 31:58.999
- Yes.
- Kristen, what did I say

31:58.999 --> 31:59.999
about paying for boys?

31:59.999 --> 32:00.999
- It's okay.
- No, Kristen.

32:00.999 --> 32:01.999
- What is the address here?
- Is he incapable

32:01.999 --> 32:02.999
of calling his own Uber?

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
- No, I just said I would,

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
'cause he doesn't know where
he's--I don't know what's--

32:06.999 --> 32:07.999
- And then you sent the address?

32:07.999 --> 32:08.999
Are you kidding?

32:08.999 --> 32:11.999
Kristen, I think, secretly
wants to be a sugar mama.

32:11.999 --> 32:14.999
She likes being the one in
control and the one in charge,

32:14.999 --> 32:17.999
but, come on, you got to make
him work for it a little bit.

32:17.999 --> 32:18.999
Thank you.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
You know, can I tell
you something?

32:20.999 --> 32:21.999
- What?

32:21.999 --> 32:24.999
- It was gonna wait till
we got a little drunky,

32:24.999 --> 32:27.999
but since you just
brought up Kevin first--

32:27.999 --> 32:28.999
- Now, I'm getting nervous.

32:28.999 --> 32:29.999
Don't tell me he's,
like, married or something.

32:29.999 --> 32:30.999
I was gonna like...

32:30.999 --> 32:35.999
- Well, I think he has
a serious live-in girlfriend.

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
- Coming up...

32:39.999 --> 32:40.999
- He apologized 100 times

32:40.999 --> 32:42.999
and it was like,
"I did something so stupid."

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
- Jax has to ruin it
for all of us

32:44.999 --> 32:46.999
and get arrested.

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
- Now, I'm getting nervous.

32:55.999 --> 32:57.999
- He has a serious
live-in girlfriend.

32:57.999 --> 32:59.999
- Who told you that?

32:59.999 --> 33:01.999
- I have some time on my hands,

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
so I just did some
Facebook stalking myself.

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
You know, there's nothing
that makes me more excited

33:05.999 --> 33:08.999
than a good stalking session.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
- Yeah, ditto.
- I don't know what I thought

33:10.999 --> 33:13.999
I would find by social media
stalking a good friend of Jax's.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.999
- What's up, girl?
- Hi.

33:15.999 --> 33:17.999
- But it makes
perfect f***ing sense

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
that Jax's friend
would have a girlfriend.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
- I need another cocktail
really quickly.

33:21.999 --> 33:23.999
- So do I.
- And I need to start

33:23.999 --> 33:24.999
to catch up to you guys.

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
- Yes, you have a lot
of catching up to do.

33:26.999 --> 33:27.999
What do you want to drink?

33:27.999 --> 33:28.999
- Let me do a vodka soda.
That sounds perfect.

33:28.999 --> 33:31.999
- Okay, perfect. Sounds good.

33:31.999 --> 33:32.999
Yeah.
- So what's up?

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
What have you guys
been talking about?

33:34.999 --> 33:37.999
- I have to be totally honest...
- Yeah?

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
- Because it's been
brought to our attention

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
that you have a girlfriend.

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
- I have an ex-girlfriend.
- Does she still live with you?

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
- No, we have separate places.

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
We've dated on and off
and we've been broken up.

33:47.999 --> 33:50.999
- I mean,
I've met this guy before.

33:50.999 --> 33:53.999
He seems nice, but I'm just
saying I saw some photos

33:53.999 --> 33:57.999
that looked like there was
some cohabitation involved.

33:57.999 --> 34:01.999
Listen, I under--I understand
on and off relationships.

34:01.999 --> 34:03.999
- You know, even though
we are doing on and off,

34:03.999 --> 34:07.999
I would much rather be
on with her and not--

34:07.999 --> 34:09.999
- Is it that serious?

34:09.999 --> 34:10.999
Are you guys gonna do like...

34:10.999 --> 34:11.999
- No.
- Long-distance relationship?

34:11.999 --> 34:14.999
- Oh, I don't know anything yet.

34:14.999 --> 34:16.999
I mean, why rush it, right?
I really like her, though.

34:16.999 --> 34:18.999
- Oh, my God, I thought that
I know everything about this.

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999
- I don't even know how she
feels about me, then so...

34:20.999 --> 34:24.999
- Like the fact that I just
waitressed is, like, not okay.

34:24.999 --> 34:27.999
- I'm sorry, but I can't
just like sit and have, like,

34:27.999 --> 34:28.999
a fake conversation and not
say what's, like, on my mind.

34:28.999 --> 34:29.999
I'll like, I'll start sweating

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
and like--

34:31.999 --> 34:32.999
- Well, and I told you
it was on and off...

34:32.999 --> 34:33.999
- Yes, you did.
- And I told you

34:33.999 --> 34:34.999
what we were doing.

34:34.999 --> 34:35.999
- I think there's
something to be said

34:35.999 --> 34:36.999
for an on and off
relationship...

34:36.999 --> 34:38.999
- No, 100%...
- And that sucks and like--

34:38.999 --> 34:40.999
- As long as they're
not on right now...

34:40.999 --> 34:41.999
- Yeah.
- And he is not cheating

34:41.999 --> 34:44.999
with me because I don't
let people cheat with me.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.999
I've never done that
a day in my life.

34:46.999 --> 34:48.999
- So there's this special
appetizer today

34:48.999 --> 34:50.999
and it's called my tongue,
which I am biting

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
because I'm not
gonna say anything

34:52.999 --> 34:53.999
since I'm on
this forgiveness kick.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.999
- Stassi, believe me,
things will be good.

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
- Thank you.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
- You're welcome.

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
- You guys are the best.

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
- I know; we're probably
making Stassi feel weird now.

35:13.999 --> 35:14.999
- This is why I watch porn.

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
- Can we get shots--
tequila--for every pole table?

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
- Okay, I'll be right back.

35:43.999 --> 35:46.999
- How long until Sandoval's
on the dance floor?

35:46.999 --> 35:48.999
- Let's all get out
there and dance.

35:48.999 --> 35:50.999
- I'm actually glad
that we're here.

35:50.999 --> 35:51.999
Once we walked in this club,
I feel like

35:51.999 --> 35:54.999
everyone sort of realized
it's time to just have fun,

35:54.999 --> 35:57.999
let loose, 'cause this is
what we came here for.

35:57.999 --> 35:59.000
- Hey, guys, guys, guys!

35:59.999 --> 36:01.999
So I want to make a toast.

36:01.999 --> 36:03.999
I'm gonna acknowledge
your birthday,

36:03.999 --> 36:05.999
your birthday,
your engagement!

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
Cheers!

36:07.999 --> 36:09.000
- Cheers, guys!

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
- Hey!

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
- let's just squash everything.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
I'm not saying you were lying.
I'm not saying Jax was lying.

36:28.999 --> 36:32.999
At the same time
I'm here now for good.

36:32.999 --> 36:33.999
Whether Jax said
that sh** or not--

36:33.999 --> 36:35.999
- It doesn't matter.

36:35.999 --> 36:36.999
- I don't really want
to go back to that.

36:36.999 --> 36:39.999
I don't want to have, like,
bad feelings going around.

36:39.999 --> 36:40.999
I'd rather have fun.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.999
- Yeah, no.
- So, I mean...

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
I just want to squash it.
It's over.

36:44.999 --> 36:47.999
Let's start over.
- I'm here to please you.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.999
- f*** it,
you know?

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
- I don't think that
Brittany's an idiot,

36:51.999 --> 36:54.999
but I do think
that she's oblivious.

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
Yeah, I want to squash it.

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
It may not be today,
tomorrow, next week,

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
but if she sticks around
with this guy,

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
she's gonna see exactly
what everyone else sees.

37:02.999 --> 37:05.999
- I could definitely, like, tell

37:05.999 --> 37:06.999
that your happiness level
is just like--

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
- I'm not gonna lie
to you, like,

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
with Brittany, it's just--
it--something's different.

37:10.999 --> 37:12.999
I don't know.
- He's so monogamous.

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
- I've never been like that.
I'm always like this.

37:14.999 --> 37:15.999
- Taylor monogamous.

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
- And, like, I truly, like,

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
I'm in love with this girl.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.000
Liquid marijuana.

37:33.999 --> 37:35.000
- Oh, that's what
I'm getting, obviously.

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
- You will rape a dolphin
if you drink that.

37:37.999 --> 37:40.999
- We are a very unique group.

37:40.999 --> 37:41.999
There's obviously weeks
where we hate each other,

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
love each other,
want to kill each other,

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
want to date each other,
but at the end of the day,

37:46.000 --> 37:47.999
we'll always stick together.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
- Oh, my gosh,
we drank too much, baby.

38:14.999 --> 38:18.999
I hate packing.

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
- Oh, God, you're not
helpful right now.

38:22.999 --> 38:24.999
- Are you packed?

38:24.999 --> 38:27.999
- We sort of never really

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
had our fiancée vacation sex.

38:29.999 --> 38:32.999
- When you go on a trip with
14 of your best friends,

38:32.999 --> 38:35.999
unless you're swingers, there's
not a lot of sex going on.

38:35.999 --> 38:38.000
I'd rather be on the beach
with my friends,

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
than hanging out
in the room, banging.

38:41.999 --> 38:43.000
We have the rest of our lives

38:43.000 --> 38:46.999
to consummate the sh**
out of our relationship.

38:46.999 --> 38:51.999
- Yeah, I want to consummate the
sh** out of this relationship.

38:53.999 --> 38:54.999
- We should probably
get going, though.

38:54.999 --> 38:55.999
- Okay.

38:55.999 --> 38:56.999
Success.

38:56.999 --> 38:58.999
I think the trip was amazing.

38:58.999 --> 38:59.999
Couple bumps in the road,

38:59.999 --> 39:02.999
but nothing really
to get crazy about.

39:02.999 --> 39:03.999
Now, we just got
a couple of hours to kill

39:03.999 --> 39:05.000
before we fly out tonight.

39:05.999 --> 39:06.000
We made it.

39:06.999 --> 39:07.000
I'm taking this.

39:07.999 --> 39:09.000
- No.

39:17.999 --> 39:19.999
- Hello?

39:19.999 --> 39:23.999
Jax, where are you?

39:23.999 --> 39:25.999
Okay, and it's
the local police station?

39:25.999 --> 39:28.999
Should we head down there, like,
soon or do we need to...

39:28.999 --> 39:29.999
- Oh, my God.

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
- All right, bye.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.999
He apologized 100 times

39:35.999 --> 39:36.999
and it was like,
"I did something so stupid

39:37.000 --> 39:37.999
and I'm so sorry."

39:38.000 --> 39:40.999
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
- Jax has to ruin it
for all of us

39:42.999 --> 39:44.999
and get arrested.

39:47.999 --> 39:49.999
- He told me that
it was, you know,

39:49.999 --> 39:53.999
for a felony charge and it was
still under investigation,

39:53.999 --> 39:55.999
so they didn't know
how long it was gonna take.

39:55.999 --> 39:57.999
They can hold him
up to 48 hours.

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
- He's a really stupid thief.

39:59.999 --> 40:01.999
- Well, it's Jax.

40:01.999 --> 40:02.999
- How much of a f***ing idiot

40:02.999 --> 40:05.999
do you have to be to steal
a pair of sunglasses?

40:05.999 --> 40:08.999
- I'm just shock--
in shock right now.

40:08.999 --> 40:11.999
What do I do now?

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
He better learn from this.

40:23.999 --> 40:25.999
- This poor girl, who thought

40:25.999 --> 40:26.999
she found the guy of her dreams,

40:26.999 --> 40:30.999
moves out to L.A.,
and then boom,

40:30.999 --> 40:31.999
he's in jail.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
- Hi, Marie.
It's Schwartz.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.999
- Hi, Schwartz.

40:39.999 --> 40:40.999
- It doesn't make any sense.

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
Dude, you can
afford the glasses,

40:42.999 --> 40:43.999
so why are you
stealing them now?

40:43.999 --> 40:45.999
- Yes!

40:47.999 --> 40:48.999
- Well, I'll page you

40:48.999 --> 40:50.999
as soon as we get him out.

40:51.999 --> 40:52.999
- We love you.

40:52.999 --> 40:53.999
All right, we'll talk
to you in a little bit.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.999
- Okay, sweetheart.
- We'll get him.

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
- Okay, bye-bye.
- All right, bye.

40:56.999 --> 40:57.999
- Bye.

40:57.999 --> 41:01.999
- The bail is $11,000.

41:01.999 --> 41:02.999
- Who's gonna post the bail?

41:05.999 --> 41:08.999
- How many shifts
at Sur is that, 11 Gs?

41:08.999 --> 41:11.999
- So we have a matter of hours
to come up with 11 grand,

41:11.999 --> 41:14.999
get him out of jail, get all of
our luggage, hop in an Uber,

41:14.999 --> 41:17.999
be at the airport to go
to Third Eye Blind tomorrow.

41:19.999 --> 41:20.999
- Yeah.

41:20.999 --> 41:21.999
- Jax is my boy

41:21.999 --> 41:23.999
and I'll do anything for him.

41:23.999 --> 41:25.000
Hey, this is Tom Schwartz.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.999
I'm trying to help out
my buddy, Jax Taylor.

41:27.999 --> 41:30.999
But like, ugh, did you
have to do it, Jax?

41:30.999 --> 41:32.999
Come on, man.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
- Hello, Jax.
- Where are you?

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
- We're on the way
to the airport.

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
Where are you?

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
Just go straight to the airport.

42:00.999 --> 42:02.999
- Mm-hmm.

42:10.999 --> 42:13.999
- I apologize.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.999
It's--it's...

42:16.999 --> 42:17.999
I mean, it's embarrassing.

42:17.999 --> 42:18.999
It really is.

42:34.999 --> 42:36.999
I'm embarrassed.

42:40.999 --> 42:43.999
'Cause it's not
the person I am.

42:48.999 --> 42:50.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
- What the hell
happened with Jax?

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
Class E felony.

42:54.999 --> 42:55.999
- He just got to f***ing

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
steal something
for the rush of it.

42:57.999 --> 42:58.999
- I want to f***ing kill him.

42:58.999 --> 43:00.999
You're either a liar,
you're a drunk,

43:00.999 --> 43:02.999
or you're a thief.
What is it, Jax?

43:02.999 --> 43:04.999
Don't try and pull the wool
over my eyes.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
- Every time I feel like
I'm hitting rock bottom,

43:06.999 --> 43:08.999
it's like, no, sh**
can always get worse.

43:08.999 --> 43:09.999
You hate me, Lisa.

43:09.999 --> 43:10.999
- You're not important
enough to hate.

43:10.999 --> 43:13.999
Sit down.

43:13.999 --> 43:14.999
