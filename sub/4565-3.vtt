Hey, honey,
what's for breakfast?

00:16.282 --> 00:19.218
Aw, it looks like auggie's
trying to be daddy's little man.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.454
Yeah, so come over here

00:24.791 --> 00:27.426
Oh yeah, come over here
and give papa a smooch.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.962
No, I am in the middle

at the courthouse early

have shaving cream--

00:32.832 --> 00:34.433
Oh.

Okay, what's going on
with her?

01:03.297 --> 01:04.863
I don't know.
Don't do anything.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.733
I'm in a good mood.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.969
This life thing?
I think I got it down.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.008
- Maya, oatmeal.
- No thanks, mrs. Matthews.

- Oh, I wasn't asking.
- Yeow.

- Farkle, you too.
- Thank you.

I was so worried about
this new school year.

03:44.959 --> 03:48.527
New school, new people,
I didn't think I was
going to survive.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.430
Not only am I surviving,
I'm thriving.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.632
I'm like a plant
going like this...

03:56.936 --> 03:58.604
What was I
so worried about?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.477
What are you doing?
Oh, but this is too easy.

04:05.479 --> 04:08.680
It's maya.
I know because I saw you
put your hand over my face.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.115
- I'll do you now.
- Oh, that's not the game.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.417
- What's the game?
- The game is

04:12.419 --> 04:16.188
Protect the plant
from the bulldozer
in the pink sweater.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.457
Oh, maya, bulldozers
don't wear pink--

04:18.459 --> 04:20.092
Huh.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.697
- You okay?
- ( thunks )

04:25.699 --> 04:26.965
Yeah.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.509
Oh, look what
the bulldozer did to you.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.579
There are other girls
in this world.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.548
- There are.
- And other girls,

04:43.550 --> 04:46.151
Like missy bradford,
are going to talk to lucas.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.954
- They are.
- I don't like that.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.923
- I know.
- I wish the world
was just me and you.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.125
Then it is.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.998
Sneak attack--
December 7th, 1941.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.266
"a date which will
live in infamy."

05:01.268 --> 05:03.869
A date?
They're going on a date?

05:05.238 --> 05:07.139
In Italy?

05:07.141 --> 05:08.907
No, honey.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.777
- You're in history.
- I'm history?

05:14.213 --> 05:16.248
Okay, put your hand up.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.217
Yes, riley?

05:19.219 --> 05:21.253
<i>You have a pertinent</i>
<i>observation</i>

05:21.255 --> 05:23.655
On the subject
of the sneak attack?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.626
"may I be excused?"

05:28.561 --> 05:30.262
My eyes see my shoes.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.238
Yes, riley,
you may be excused.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.274
Forever?

05:44.010 --> 05:46.178
No, you have to come back
to class at some point, honey.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.646
You just have to.

05:55.221 --> 05:58.023
It was another sunny day
in paradise

05:58.025 --> 06:01.326
Before the sneak attack
that changed everything.

06:05.098 --> 06:08.200
Do you like the movies?
Dark at the movies.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.637
Depends on the movie.
Depends who I'm going with.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.141
Mm, scary movies?
I get scared
at scary movies.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.909
You'll take care
of me though, right?

06:21.681 --> 06:24.116
People who had viewed
themselves as safe

06:24.118 --> 06:26.551
No longer had
any security at all.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.887
Just you and me, missy?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.722
Just you and me, lucas.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.757
Boop.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.799
Boop?

06:40.801 --> 06:42.868
That's the best you got?

06:42.870 --> 06:45.203
Please be cool,
please be cool,
please be cool.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.974
You don't think
that I can do boop?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.709
How bad do you think
this is gonna be?

06:50.711 --> 06:52.978
I think we should have
some faith in our riley.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.247
I can do boop
like you've never seen.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.281
Boop!

07:00.253 --> 07:01.887
Does anybody see this?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.688
Everybody sees this.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.327
Take your finger out!

07:10.363 --> 07:12.964
Can't.
Can't move.
Scared.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.202
Do you think lucas knows?

07:21.340 --> 07:23.675
Riley, I've never seen
anything like this before.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.911
I don't know
what's going to happen.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.946
- Farkle?
- Boy, riley.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.048
I don't think I could
do that even if I tried.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.150
Hey, maya, boop.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.153
Oh no.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.725
The bombing of pearl harbor
was our official entrance

07:40.727 --> 07:43.728
Into a world at war,
and nothing

07:43.730 --> 07:45.263
Would ever be the same.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.074
- You want me
to bring you lunch?
- No.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.009
Food would only
keep me alive.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.180
Come on, little plant.
Come back into the sun.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.417
I'm afraid something
terrible will happen

08:05.419 --> 08:06.985
If I ever come
out of here.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.687
Riley, that's crazy.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.656
Nothing could be worse than
what's already happened.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.093
Oh, there you are.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.230
I've been looking for you.
You're not upset with me,
are you?

08:18.232 --> 08:21.066
Because I didn't hear
that you and lucas were
together or anything.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.235
- We're not.
- Hmm, yeah,

08:23.237 --> 08:25.203
That's what I thought.
So if you're not,

08:25.205 --> 08:27.672
Then it's not a problem
if I ask lucas out,

08:27.674 --> 08:30.175
Because he's really cute.
Don't you think?

08:32.111 --> 08:34.312
I loathe you.

08:35.147 --> 08:37.249
Well, lucas doesn't.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.351
In fact, I think
he's kind of into me.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.219
Shocker.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.359
I live here now.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.167
Come on, p.J. Time.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.837
- No, thank you.
- Oh come on, what's
tonight's thing?

08:58.839 --> 09:01.373
- No more p.J.S.
- But they have
mr. Googly on them.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.476
I can't wear those anymore.

09:04.478 --> 09:07.245
- Why not?
- Because she won't like them.

09:07.247 --> 09:11.116
Hey, I'm the only "she"
who gets to see you
in your pajamas.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.253
You never know.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.022
Auggie?

09:17.024 --> 09:19.758
Do us a favor
and don't grow up
so fast, okay?

09:19.760 --> 09:23.161
I need to.
I need to grow up and go
to bed like daddy does.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.498
( laughs )
how does daddy
go to bed?

09:26.500 --> 09:28.066
Like this.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.769
Ho, mama!

09:32.872 --> 09:35.974
- I don't do that.
- Yeah, you do.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.108
Every night.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.878
Yeah, but I do it
better than that.

09:41.013 --> 09:42.447
If you say so.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.383
Auggie, can I at least
have my good-night kiss?

09:45.385 --> 09:48.286
- Okay?
- We're not going
to do that anymore.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.223
It's tonight's thing.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.960
Kissing's for babies.
Men shake hands.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.896
Good night, father.
Good night, mother.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.764
What's happening?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.199
Don't take it
personally, cory.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.001
He thinks
he's being an adult.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.204
How can he be an adult?
I'm not an adult!

10:07.406 --> 10:10.542
Auggie, please,
take mr. Googly, okay?

10:13.479 --> 10:15.246
Goodbye.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.796
To grow up
and to grow up fast.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.865
- So what do I do?
- Nothing.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.167

You're a genius at this.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.836
- Grow me up.
- Why?

10:37.838 --> 10:40.205
- Because everybody else is.

I just-- I don't want
him with her.

11:08.235 --> 11:11.836
- Am I jealous?
- You wouldn't know
how to be jealous.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.506
I just-- I don't want
him taken away from us.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.175
She's bad news.
Teach me how to flirt.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.380

11:37.197 --> 11:40.231
Why, thank you.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.367
Can you teach me
how to flirt with lucas?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.202
I would do
whatever you asked me.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.304
But I thought
you loved her.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.506
I love both of you.
I want you happy.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.514
So you think
he'll sit with us

11:56.516 --> 11:58.450
Or  <i>her?</i>

11:58.452 --> 12:01.352
I try not to worry
about things I have
no control over.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.288
Really?
Because that's all I do.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.623
- Hey, can I sit with you guys?
- You better.

12:05.625 --> 12:09.094
So you think he'll
sit with us or her?

12:11.030 --> 12:13.098
Hey, what's up?
Is there a seat with you guys?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.233
Always room
for you, buddy.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.602
I said "buddy."
I'm not helping myself, am I?

12:21.607 --> 12:23.908
Well, you know,
I was just thinking

12:23.910 --> 12:26.211
That if you and I are going
to the movies together,

12:26.213 --> 12:29.180
I should find out
what kind of snacks you like
so I could buy some for you.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.648
Because-- ( laughs )

12:30.650 --> 12:32.917
I wouldn't want you
paying for everything.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.988
- You're toast.
- I know.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.690
Are you saying she flirts
better than you?

12:38.692 --> 12:40.258
Oh, nobody's better
than farkle.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.161
I just don't think
my young protege

12:43.163 --> 12:45.063
Is ready for that monster.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.132
So what are you
gonna do, genius?

12:47.134 --> 12:49.701
I think I'll just steal her
from lucas myself.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.302
You would do that for me?

12:51.304 --> 12:54.606
Well, I'm certainly not
doing it for me, toots.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.142
She's evil.
If I'm not back in two minutes,

12:57.144 --> 12:59.611
She ate me.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.680
- How's my hair?
- It hasn't changed
in six years.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.383
She doesn't
stand a chance.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.421
Hello, lady.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.258
- Farkle.
- Why go to the movies
with a boy

13:13.260 --> 13:16.427
When you can go with a man?

13:18.330 --> 13:20.031
Enjoy.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.534
Wow, look at you.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.536
You're next.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.209
It worked.
I'm next.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.146
Riley, she's too good.
You can't compete with her.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.515
I don't want them together.
I don't.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.450
Riley?

13:39.452 --> 13:42.153
- Lucas.
- Riley.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.490
I don't know what's
going on here and I don't
have any right to say this,

13:45.492 --> 13:48.359
But I don't think you should
hang out alone with this girl.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.161
Why not?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.629
I don't really know,

13:51.631 --> 13:54.199
I think if you actually
spend time with her alone

13:54.201 --> 13:57.235
It's gonna change things for--
you know,

13:57.237 --> 14:01.539
- All of us.
- Well, aren't you just
a concerned friend?

14:01.541 --> 14:06.244
Well, with you around,
how could I ever possibly
get lucas alone?

14:09.081 --> 14:11.082
Food fight!

14:11.084 --> 14:13.051
- Hey!
- No food fight!

14:13.053 --> 14:14.485
Detention this afternoon,

14:14.487 --> 14:16.321
Both of you!

14:16.323 --> 14:18.256
Oh no, both of us--

14:18.258 --> 14:20.158
Alone.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.731
- How could you do that, dad?
- What did I do?

14:26.733 --> 14:29.200
You gave them
detention together.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.802
I was the cafeteria monitor.

14:30.804 --> 14:33.638
I saw potatoes not where
potatoes are supposed to be.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.407
Detention him,
detention her.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.244
But lucas didn't even
do anything.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.379
Don't care.
I'm mad with power.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.449
Then I want detention too.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.084
You do?

14:46.086 --> 14:48.519
Riley, you've never had
detention in your whole life.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.289
What could you possibly do
that would get you detention

14:51.291 --> 14:55.159
I could introduce you
to my special guest star.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.261
Uh-oh.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.062
Nothing personal, bub.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.431
( groans )

15:00.433 --> 15:02.634
( sputters gibberish )

15:02.636 --> 15:04.535
Yeah, that'll do it.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.473
- Nice job.
- Pleasure doing
business with you.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.277
<i>♪ oh oh oh oh.</i>

15:13.212 --> 15:15.280
Oh my gosh,
look at you.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.315
How's my breath?
( exhales )

15:17.317 --> 15:20.685
Ooh, like flowers.
How'd you do that?

15:20.687 --> 15:23.254
I ate your flowers.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.424
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.159
You're an older
woman, right?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.495
Okay, where is
this going?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.299
I have an older woman
coming over.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.167
Her name is ava,
she likes cheese

15:36.169 --> 15:37.769
And I'm in love with her.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.638
Really?
Where is ava from?

15:40.640 --> 15:44.809
Do you think
you could find some cheese
and make yourself scarce?

15:46.745 --> 15:49.180
-    <i>( doorbell rings )</i>
<i>- too late, she's here.</i>

15:49.182 --> 15:51.115
I'll g-g-g--
I'll g-g-g--

15:51.117 --> 15:52.750
Okay okay okay,
calm down.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.153
Women like it when you're calm.
Just take a deep breath,

15:55.155 --> 15:56.688
Okay?
And then open the door.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.623
I can't wait to meet
your older woman.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.627
- Hi, auggie.
- Hi, ava.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.762
This is my mommy.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.264
It's so nice
to meet you, ava.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.499
You got cheese?
I like cheese.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.834
So I've heard.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.869
So, um, ava?

16:11.871 --> 16:13.271
<i>How old are you?</i>

16:13.273 --> 16:15.273
I'm this many.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.208
I see.
Older woman.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.211
Yeah, because auggie's
this many.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.813
Yeah, but you like him
anyway, right?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.214
- Yeah.
- How come?

16:23.216 --> 16:27.385
Because this many
tells this many what to do.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.822
What?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.724
I'm okay with it, mom.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.792
Really?

16:34.794 --> 16:36.728
Because I have
some thoughts.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.198
Is that a mr. Googly?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.265
No.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.336
I think it is.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.705
It's not mine.
I'm too old for it.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.774
- I want it!
-  <i>What?  Ava...</i>

16:49.776 --> 16:51.876
Why would you want
a mr. Googly?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.378
You're this many.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.780
I love mr. Googly.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.515
I'm taking him.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.584
But you're all growed up.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.286
I don't care.
He's mine now.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.889
( laughs )
actually, ava,
what you're gonna do

17:04.891 --> 17:06.791
Is give mr. Googly
back to auggie.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.326
Why would I do that?

17:08.328 --> 17:10.428
Because I'm this many

17:10.430 --> 17:12.797
And this many gets
to tell this many what to do.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.267
- Do you like rides?
- Yeah.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.935
Oh great!
Let's take a ride

17:17.937 --> 17:20.338
All the way
back to your house!

17:20.340 --> 17:22.974
- Bye-bye, auggie.
- Bye-bye, ava.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.543
Okay, bye-bye, ava.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.711
- Bye!
- Bye.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.347
So what'd you think of her?

17:38.323 --> 17:40.892
- How you doing?
- What are you doing here?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.394
Oh, I'm a bad girl.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.597
Yeah, you don't want
to mess with this one.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.767
( scoffs )
what are these, place cards?

17:49.769 --> 17:52.370
Yep, I made them.
You sit over there.

17:55.607 --> 17:59.377
I think this seat has
my name on it, actually.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.581
All right, guys.
I like my detention

18:03.583 --> 18:05.316
To have a little
learning in it.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.652
So I'd like to continue
talking about pearl harbor

18:07.654 --> 18:10.354
And what happened
after the sneak attack.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.424
The world was at war

18:13.426 --> 18:15.393
<i>And alliances were</i>
<i>forged in battle</i>

18:15.395 --> 18:18.362
<i>And were made stronger</i>
<i>because of that.</i>

18:19.298 --> 18:20.998
What is this place?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.334
It's detention, farkle.
It's not for you.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.303
If my friends are in it,
then it's for me.

18:27.706 --> 18:30.308
During this war

18:30.310 --> 18:33.544
The United States was put
to one of its greatest tests

18:33.546 --> 18:35.713
When it met a threat
to our way of life.

18:36.982 --> 18:39.350
<i>But because we were united</i>

18:39.352 --> 18:41.319
-  <i>We prevailed.</i>
<i>- Hey, riley?</i>

18:41.321 --> 18:43.721
Missy invited me to see
a movie with her.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.290
I think she's aware
of that, lucas.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.326
No need to make her
feel worse.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.728
And I was wondering

18:50.730 --> 18:53.030
If maybe you guys would like
to come along with us?

18:56.335 --> 18:58.069
You want us?

18:58.071 --> 19:01.038
Uh uh,
I'm sorry, lucas.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.009
- That wasn't
the invitation.
- Oh!

19:05.011 --> 19:07.445
Well then,

19:07.447 --> 19:10.081
I'm sorry, missy,
but I can't go.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.782
Missy:
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

19:11.784 --> 19:14.051
Nobody's ever turned
me down in my life.

19:14.053 --> 19:17.555
Well, see,
these are my friends.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.391
And I don't like doing anything
without my friends.

19:21.727 --> 19:22.994
Right, riley?

19:22.996 --> 19:24.695
Yeah.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.097
Right.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.733
Now I certainly appreciate
your wanting me

19:28.735 --> 19:30.568
To care of you
during a scary movie,

19:30.570 --> 19:32.503
And you showing me
your leg and all,

19:32.505 --> 19:36.107
But back here
in the seventh grade,

19:36.109 --> 19:39.343
I think maybe
we'd have more fun
just hanging out together.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.112
Boop.

19:46.385 --> 19:47.451
Grow up.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.086
Not...

19:49.088 --> 19:51.422
Yet.

19:53.091 --> 19:54.959
Oh, she's leaving?
Okay.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.133
You know what the easiest thing
about having friends is?

20:02.135 --> 20:04.435
- What?
- Sometimes

20:04.437 --> 20:06.504
All you have
to do is trust them.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.908
When peace time came,
the United States

20:10.910 --> 20:13.144
Enjoyed its greatest
period of growth,

20:13.146 --> 20:15.112
<i>Prosperity and happiness.</i>

20:16.415 --> 20:18.115
Detention over.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.619
You guys coming?

20:22.588 --> 20:24.121
No, we're good
right here.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.968
Good night, mother.
Good night, father.

20:39.938 --> 20:42.506
I'm not sure how much longer
I can put up with this.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.141
Now you listen
to me, kid.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.510
You take these jammies
and you wear them.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.815
And you take mr. Googly

20:50.817 --> 20:53.150
And you hold on to him
for as long as you can.

20:53.152 --> 20:55.486
- Why?
- Because he's your friend,

20:55.488 --> 20:57.188
You can trust him
and he loves you.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.956
Right?

20:58.958 --> 21:01.025
Yeah, he does.

21:01.027 --> 21:04.729
And, auggie, it's very important
that you hold onto your friends.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.932
And, auggie, stay this many
for as long as possible,

21:07.934 --> 21:10.134
'cause when it's gone,
it's gone.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.168
Good night, buddy.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.674
- You want one?
- Yeah.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.809
Then you have to catch me!

21:20.112 --> 21:21.746
You want one?

21:21.748 --> 21:23.047
Yeah!

21:23.049 --> 21:25.783
- Then you have to catch me!
- Oh, mama!
