<i>"School Spirits"...</i>

00:03.870 --> 00:04.970
- Mr. Anderson, can I ask
what you were doing there?

00:05.170 --> 00:06.040
Drive safe, Simon.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.640
- Some toddler
with a badge said

00:07.840 --> 00:09.340
that you're calling off
my search party.

00:09.540 --> 00:10.740
- I assure you
we're doing everything

00:10.940 --> 00:12.080
to find out what happened
to your daughter.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.440
You don't think it's weird,

00:13.640 --> 00:14.880
<i>Mr. Anderson giving Maddie</i>
<i>his number?</i>

00:15.080 --> 00:15.880
I gotta get to class.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.080
Have you seen his car?

00:17.280 --> 00:18.610
It's like he sleeps in it
or something.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.150
<i>- You broke into his car, Si.</i>
<i>Why'd you do that?</i>

00:20.350 --> 00:21.280
- I'll solve my murder
on my own.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.320
Holy shit.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.350
I found something.

00:23.550 --> 00:24.350
I shouldn't have given Maddie

00:24.550 --> 00:26.290
that fucking money.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.020
- Why does he have
a shitload of cash

00:28.220 --> 00:29.090
hidden in his classroom?

00:29.290 --> 00:30.160
I'm guessing it has to do

00:30.360 --> 00:31.760
with why you're dead.

[huffs] I can't believe it.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.920
It won't recognize his face.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.390
I'm never gonna
guess his passcode.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.530
Three minutes.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.030
- Oh, my God,
unlock your phone.

01:11.230 --> 01:13.040
Check your email. Do something.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.440
Tell him to check his email.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.570
What?

01:17.770 --> 01:18.940
Come on, don't you wanna know

01:19.140 --> 01:20.780
why he's got tons of money
stuffed in his wall

01:20.980 --> 01:22.550
or why he thinks
he gave some of it to me?

01:22.740 --> 01:24.510
Simon.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.680
Eyes on your paper, please.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.150
Sorry.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.990
Maybe it's his birthday.

01:32.190 --> 01:35.330
I'm thinking '81, '82.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.460
Did he have any
Dave Matthews Band in his car?

01:37.660 --> 01:39.090
Little help here.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.400
[school bell rings]

01:48.600 --> 01:49.840
OK, pens down.

OK, thank you, Rhonda.

Though maybe
we narrow it down a bit.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.610
I'm afraid reciting
all of Ginsburg

Because...

03:07.520 --> 03:08.820
Maddie, hi.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.190
Nice of you to join us.
We're brainstorming fun things

03:11.390 --> 03:12.790
we could all do this weekend.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.390
- I'll tell you
what I wanna do.

03:14.590 --> 03:16.260
I wanna figure out
why Mr. Anderson was talking

03:16.460 --> 03:19.230
to someone on his phone about
giving me money last night.

03:19.430 --> 03:20.830
- OK.
I'm--

03:21.030 --> 03:22.630
I'm not sure
how to board that, but--

03:22.830 --> 03:24.130
Wait, who was he talking to?

03:24.330 --> 03:25.700
- That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

03:25.900 --> 03:29.240
So I need to know if anyone
here has seen anything.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.880
Seriously?

03:34.080 --> 03:35.880
All we do is haunt the halls
of the stupid school,

03:36.080 --> 03:37.080
and none of you have
seen anything

03:37.280 --> 03:38.110
suspicious from Anderson?

03:38.310 --> 03:39.420
Oh, well, OK.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.390
Well, one time
I saw Mr. Anderson misspell

03:43.590 --> 03:45.890
the word "fundraiser"
on a Boosters Club poster,

03:46.090 --> 03:47.990
and I--he forgot the D.

03:48.190 --> 03:49.430
I feel like that's
pretty suspicious

03:49.630 --> 03:51.030
coming from an English teacher.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.830
- Wally, I'm pretty sure
that was a pun.

03:54.030 --> 03:58.370
So I'm assuming he probably
did that on purpose.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.740
- Sorry, sweets,
we don't just stand around

04:01.940 --> 04:04.010
staring at the living all day.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.310
No.

04:05.510 --> 04:08.640
You plan weekend fun
like movie nights.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.180
Well, we do what we can

04:10.380 --> 04:11.710
to break up
the monotony, Maddie.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.320
- That's all.
- If I may,

04:13.520 --> 04:16.950
to be fair, watching
the same five sports movies

04:17.150 --> 04:20.990
over and over again is kind of
monotonous, Mr. Martin.

04:21.190 --> 04:22.790
I thought you loved "Rudy."

04:22.990 --> 04:24.630
No.

04:24.830 --> 04:25.960
Wow.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.430
Just w--I can't even.

04:28.630 --> 04:32.270
- OK, so if none
of you have seen anything,

04:32.470 --> 04:33.970
then what about the others?

04:34.170 --> 04:35.770
<i>[tense music]</i>

04:35.970 --> 04:38.540
Maybe one of the other
ghosts has seen something.

04:38.740 --> 04:45.610
<i>* *</i>

04:51.690 --> 04:53.520
- Am I allowed
to barf on camera?

04:53.720 --> 04:55.190
My media class has
to do interviews

04:55.390 --> 04:56.690
on all the homecoming court
nominees,

04:56.890 --> 04:58.130
and guess who got Claire?

04:58.330 --> 05:00.030
OK, yeah. [chuckles]

05:00.230 --> 05:02.000
- Barfing might be appropriate.
- I know.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.300
Oh, hey, so I got an update
on Maddie's boot print.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.240
Xavier said
the cops canvassed the area

05:07.440 --> 05:08.900
where we were last night
and found more prints

05:09.100 --> 05:10.710
leading to a service road.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.140
Hello? You know
what this means, right?

05:14.340 --> 05:16.210
Maddie's alive.

05:16.410 --> 05:18.310
Yeah, and whatever happened
in the boiler room,

05:18.510 --> 05:20.250
she got out and she's OK.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.620
- What's going on
with you and Xavier?

05:22.820 --> 05:24.390
Yesterday you were ready
to put his head on a stick.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.920
Now you guys are what,
texting buddies?

05:27.120 --> 05:29.120
- I--I don't know, Simon,

05:29.320 --> 05:30.260
maybe it's
about you ghosting me

05:30.460 --> 05:31.330
ever since Maddie went missing

05:31.530 --> 05:32.900
instead of helping me find her.

05:33.090 --> 05:35.330
I mean, seriously,
where were you last night?

05:35.530 --> 05:37.670
I texted you, like, ten times.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.640
OK, look.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.970
The reason I--

05:44.170 --> 05:47.310
this is gonna sound
sort of crazy.

05:47.510 --> 05:49.610
I've been talking
to her, Nicole.

05:51.210 --> 05:53.280
- Of course you have.
So have I.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.080
I mean, not, like, out loud,

05:55.280 --> 05:56.490
because she's not really gone.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.650
I feel her just like you do.

05:58.850 --> 06:01.790
A--and I got us tickets
to Horror Con

06:01.990 --> 06:03.230
for tonight to prove it.

06:03.420 --> 06:04.560
And if there's a safe place
for us to meet,

06:04.760 --> 06:06.300
Horror Con is it.
I mean, she's never missed it.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.700
Nicole, listen to me.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.500
I know you wanna believe
Maddie's alive.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.400
She's not.
She is gone,

06:11.600 --> 06:13.900
and not the kind of gone
you come back from.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.470
How do you know that?

06:16.670 --> 06:18.910
I can't tell you how.

06:19.110 --> 06:20.910
I just--I do.

06:24.450 --> 06:25.620
<i>But I don't understand.</i>

06:25.810 --> 06:27.320
What would be so bad
about talking to them?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.490
- Maddie, they're replaying
their last days on Earth

06:29.690 --> 06:31.190
like they're still living them,

06:31.390 --> 06:32.860
spinning like tops,

06:33.050 --> 06:35.020
and you don't wanna be there
when they finally spiral out.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.860
Why?

06:37.060 --> 06:38.160
- Haven't you ever heard
you're not supposed

06:38.360 --> 06:39.730
to wake a sleepwalker?

06:39.930 --> 06:43.430
They can mistake you as part
of their nightmare or worse.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.840
- What would be worse
than that?

06:46.030 --> 06:48.800
- Y--you get trapped
in a nightmare of your own,

06:49.000 --> 06:50.940
start looping yourself.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.780
Oh, speaking of looping.

06:52.970 --> 06:54.210
OK, "Bull Durham."

06:54.410 --> 06:55.510
Eh, too much baseball.

06:55.710 --> 06:59.280
- OK.
Uh..."The Natural."

06:59.480 --> 07:00.850
Way too much baseball.

07:01.050 --> 07:02.920
Boom, we got it.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.290
"Rad Racing."

07:04.490 --> 07:05.760
- Oh, is that the one
where they do

07:05.950 --> 07:08.190
the BMX bike ballet
at the school dance?

07:08.390 --> 07:10.460
- Yes, it is,
and it's freakin' amazing.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.630
- Oh, no,
it's absolutely not though.

07:12.830 --> 07:13.860
Sorry.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.970
What about her? Dawn.

07:21.170 --> 07:22.840
She basically goes
through people's things

07:23.040 --> 07:23.840
and lives in the halls.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.210
Maybe she knows something.

07:25.410 --> 07:27.340
- Ugh.
- Good luck with that.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.950
The only thing Dawn could
tell you is your horoscope--

07:30.150 --> 07:31.480
from 1972.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.480
- Yeah, Rhonda's right.
She's a literal dead end.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.050
- Mm, more like a cul-de-sac.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.220
- Well, you know what?
So are you guys right now.

07:37.420 --> 07:40.320
I mean, I'm not afraid
of the walking dead.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.890
OK? So talk.

07:42.090 --> 07:43.760
I need names.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.530
[school bell rings]

07:51.200 --> 07:52.400
Oh, hey.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.000
What are you doing
after seventh?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.400
Uh, going to biology.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.610
Not anymore.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.110
Let's go.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.340
OK.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.280
I know what people think.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.610
They hear "grief counselor"

08:02.810 --> 08:04.950
and assume it means
just one thing.

08:05.150 --> 08:07.680
But you can talk to me
whether you're grieving

08:07.880 --> 08:09.350
or angry

08:09.550 --> 08:12.490
or confused.
[phone chiming]

08:12.690 --> 08:15.260
Sorry, excuse me.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.190
- In fact,
you might feel one thing

08:18.390 --> 08:20.960
while your friend feels
another.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.200
But here's the thing.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.470
Hope is a very powerful
emotion,

08:24.670 --> 08:26.270
and I would caution you
not to take it away

08:26.470 --> 08:28.640
- from someone else.
- Yeah.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.040
- Remember, my office
is always open.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.110
If you're free now...

08:33.310 --> 08:34.140
Sorry, thank you.

08:34.340 --> 08:35.180
Actually--actually, no thanks.

wrote one anyway.

Swim team captain,

honors student,

Claire really does it all.

Oh, you mean that thing
at the pool?

09:04.770 --> 09:07.380
I was just at the right place
at the right time.

09:09.310 --> 09:12.820
- So Claire, what would being
homecoming queen mean to you?

09:13.010 --> 09:14.750
Well, firstly,

09:14.950 --> 09:18.220
I have to say being nominated
is such an honor.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.260
So thank you, everyone.

09:21.460 --> 09:25.760
But honestly,
the only homecoming

09:25.960 --> 09:28.760
that matters this year
is Maddie's.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.730
I mean, I--I'd give up my crown

09:30.930 --> 09:33.070
in a second
if it brought Maddie back.

09:33.270 --> 09:36.540
I keep thinking I wish
I could have seen something

09:36.740 --> 09:40.640
or done something to help her,

09:40.840 --> 09:43.080
like how I saved Ava.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.250
Maddie didn't drown, Claire.

09:47.450 --> 09:48.480
- No, I--I know.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.750
- But you think
you could have saved her?

09:49.950 --> 09:51.520
- No, I just--I--
- It's funny,

09:51.720 --> 09:52.760
I haven't heard you say
two words to her

money in his wall,

of my phone when he should've

22:31.880 --> 22:33.250

Maddie knew about,

handed over.

- It is a piece
of Maddie's phone.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.990
I found it in the auto shop,
and I gave it to Mr. Anderson.

23:48.190 --> 23:50.260
Why Mr. Anderson?

- No one.

You can look at it.

24:12.850 --> 24:14.780
We got a pretty good theory
if you wanna hear it.

24:16.550 --> 24:17.920
Maddie wanted
to leave Split River,

24:18.120 --> 24:20.120
and she really didn't
wanna be found,

24:20.320 --> 24:22.920
so she made it look like there
had been some sort of attack.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.360
But she needed someone's help,

24:33.270 --> 24:35.870
When in reality,
she simply ran away.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.930
I shouldn't have told you.

25:05.030 --> 25:07.170

maybe that's why she ran away.

to see him again.

33:13.050 --> 33:14.920
Just my luck he became
a teacher here,

33:15.120 --> 33:20.530
because, um, now all I do
is see him and just--

33:20.730 --> 33:25.200
and just wish I could
take back those words.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.840
I'm sorry, Charley.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.340
Thanks.

33:33.570 --> 33:34.980
Look, I swear
I'm not telling you this

33:35.180 --> 33:37.280
to bum you out further.

33:37.480 --> 33:40.080
OK?

33:40.280 --> 33:41.720
I'm telling you this
because you need to know

33:41.920 --> 33:43.250
that you are not alone.

33:43.450 --> 33:46.020
We're all Split River Devils.

33:46.220 --> 33:48.860
For better or worse,
we're in this together.

33:55.260 --> 34:00.770
- Charley, why am I a Bandit
and not a Devil?

34:00.970 --> 34:01.940
Well, after the bus crash,

34:02.140 --> 34:03.240
people started getting
these ideas

34:03.440 --> 34:05.270
that the Devil mascot
was partly to blame

34:05.470 --> 34:07.210
instead of,
you know, black ice.

34:07.410 --> 34:08.640
- Plus none
of the survivors wanted

34:08.840 --> 34:10.210
to wear their uniforms anymore.

34:10.410 --> 34:12.580
- So they changed the mascot
and became the Bandits?

34:12.780 --> 34:14.480
Yeah.

34:14.680 --> 34:17.050
Thank you, guys,

34:17.250 --> 34:19.990
for everything.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.020
I'll tell everyone
the truth tomorrow.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.320
Mr. Martin, everyone.

34:26.460 --> 34:29.660
Maybe don't.

34:31.330 --> 34:32.730
Really?

34:32.930 --> 34:35.370
I think he's right.

34:35.570 --> 34:38.010
I think we should keep
this contained,

34:38.210 --> 34:39.340
you know, for now.

34:39.540 --> 34:40.410
OK.

34:40.610 --> 34:44.080
So what do we do now?

34:47.980 --> 34:50.180
- Now we have to find
some flowers.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.460
- I've never seen her
on ground level before.

34:59.660 --> 35:03.060
- I've never seen her
not scream at us before.

35:03.260 --> 35:06.600
- I've actually never seen
"Waiting for Godot" before.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.370
These smell stolen.

35:08.570 --> 35:11.810
More like borrowed.

35:12.010 --> 35:15.010
But you know, you deserve
some recognition too,

35:15.210 --> 35:19.350
a thank you
for keeping us all safe.

35:19.550 --> 35:21.120
Well, it's not about me.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.250
It's about the work.

35:23.450 --> 35:26.090
But I appreciate it.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.190
- You know,
we're not that different.

35:30.390 --> 35:31.860
I'm trying to prevent
what happened to me

35:32.060 --> 35:33.830
from happening
to someone else too.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.740
I found this
on the floor earlier.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.170
Does this mean anything to you?

35:48.680 --> 35:52.580
- Yeah.
Your Hawaiian shirt guy,

35:52.780 --> 35:54.580
he's always banging
around here,

35:54.780 --> 35:56.220
interrupting my work.

35:58.050 --> 35:59.690
Sorry,

35:59.890 --> 36:01.120

37:08.260 --> 37:11.060
- Did Mr. Anderson
even pay this?

37:11.260 --> 37:13.930
We need Simon
to call this place.

37:14.130 --> 37:16.760
- Mr. Anderson totally
played us.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.600
I mean, they're convinced
I helped you run away.

37:19.800 --> 37:20.530
- Seriously?
That's--

37:20.730 --> 37:21.640
I know.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.800
They only let me come back here

37:23.000 --> 37:24.070
'cause I promised
I'd get Anderson's phone

37:24.270 --> 37:25.770
and turn it in.

37:25.970 --> 37:28.010
OK, well, before you do that,

37:28.210 --> 37:29.640
I think I might have found
something that can help,

37:29.840 --> 37:31.710
maybe keep the cops
off your back.

37:33.980 --> 37:35.780
- Thank you all
for meeting on a Friday.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.290
Simon? What are you doing?

37:37.480 --> 37:38.650
Uh, we're in the middle of a--

37:38.850 --> 37:40.020
- Faculty meeting, I know.
But I have something

37:40.220 --> 37:41.220
you need to see.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.990
This is one of our new
band uniforms,

37:43.190 --> 37:45.030
the ones the Boosters all
raised money for last summer.

37:45.220 --> 37:48.000
Mr. Anderson kindly offered
to order them himself.

37:48.190 --> 37:50.960
Only problem is the uniforms
he purchased aren't new.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.430
They were retired
and stowed away for decades.

37:53.630 --> 37:57.810
- Simon, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.270
So you didn't find these,

37:59.470 --> 38:01.010
spruce 'em up,
and pay yourself that money?

38:01.210 --> 38:02.440
What?

38:02.640 --> 38:05.810
No. I a--I absolutely did not.

38:06.010 --> 38:07.520
- Then how do you explain
this receipt?

38:07.710 --> 38:10.580
The company doesn't even exist.

38:10.780 --> 38:13.890
And as for our mascot,

38:14.090 --> 38:16.290
Mr. Anderson used it
to cover up

38:16.490 --> 38:17.990
all traces of the old one.

38:23.730 --> 38:26.400
I can't prove he hurt Maddie,

38:26.600 --> 38:28.200
but I can prove this.

38:28.400 --> 38:35.080

39:16.980 --> 39:19.650
- What do you think's
gonna happen?

39:19.850 --> 39:22.690
- He'll be questioned,
probably arrested.

39:22.890 --> 39:25.660
But not for murder.

39:25.860 --> 39:29.400
I swear to God, if I died over
some stupid band uniforms...

39:29.600 --> 39:32.700
Maybe he'll confess.

39:32.900 --> 39:37.440
- Or...you'll turn that phone
over to the cops

39:37.640 --> 39:40.210
and we'll never know
who he was working with

39:40.410 --> 39:43.710
or why he said
he gave me money.

39:45.110 --> 39:48.310
I'll never know
what really happened to me.

40:00.990 --> 40:04.030
At least for now some
of the heat will be off you.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.410
What are you doing?

40:16.610 --> 40:20.580
I was thinking...

40:20.780 --> 40:22.350
I can't hug you,

40:22.550 --> 40:27.190
but my sweater can.

40:27.390 --> 40:29.290
Next best thing.

40:42.740 --> 40:46.410
- You ever think we'd be in
our own real life horror movie?

40:46.610 --> 40:48.810
Eh, it could be worse.

40:49.010 --> 40:51.180
Really? How?

40:51.380 --> 40:56.150
- You could've turned into
a zombie instead of a ghost.

40:56.350 --> 40:58.150
Or a blob.

40:58.350 --> 41:00.620
- [laughs]
You would make a great blob.

41:00.820 --> 41:02.560
Thank you.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.300
You should go.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.500
Get Anderson's phone.
Get some sleep.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.880
Good night, Maddie.

41:28.850 --> 41:30.580

Wasn't sure you'd make it.

42:01.380 --> 42:03.020
Wally finally let me decide.

42:03.220 --> 42:04.620
I know it's a little
on the nose,

42:04.820 --> 42:07.120
but can't go wrong with Swayze.

42:13.090 --> 42:14.900
What's this?

42:17.060 --> 42:19.870
- Write what you wanna
say to Emilio.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.270
I'll make sure he gets it.

42:23.840 --> 42:24.910
- You--you don't have to.

42:25.100 --> 42:27.240
I want to.

cardboard caps in the air

43:01.710 --> 43:03.540

because nothing changes.

43:08.150 --> 43:10.220

43:13.250 --> 43:14.860
I know I'm not always a joiner,

43:15.050 --> 43:19.560

to help Janet,
