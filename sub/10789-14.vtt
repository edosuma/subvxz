WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:04.792
MY GOD,
SHE IS GORGEOUS.

00:04.792 --> 00:07.458
EVEN I CAN
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:07.458 --> 00:07.834
(SIGHS)

00:07.834 --> 00:09.917
AND THIS ONE,

00:09.917 --> 00:10.792
SHE KNOWS HOW TO
TURN ON THE FUN.

00:10.792 --> 00:13.208
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

00:13.208 --> 00:14.625
CAN YOU AFFORD HER?

00:14.625 --> 00:17.875
PLEASE, JACK, DO NOT
TARNISH THIS MOMENT
WITH TALK OF MONEY.

00:17.875 --> 00:18.917
I'M JUST SAYING--

00:18.917 --> 00:20.500
I MUST HAVE HER,

00:20.500 --> 00:22.625
THEREFORE
I CAN AFFORD HER.

00:22.625 --> 00:24.000
HER...

00:24.000 --> 00:25.625
AND ALL OF HER
LITTLE TOYS, TOO.

00:25.625 --> 00:30.125
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

00:30.125 --> 00:31.750
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS EVEN GONNA
DO WITH SOMETHING THIS BIG?

00:31.750 --> 00:34.542
I MEAN, IT'S
KIND OF GROTESQUE,

00:34.542 --> 00:36.708
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT
THAT EMMA'S GONNA FREAK OUT

00:36.708 --> 00:37.959
WHEN YOU DRAG THIS
THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM.

00:37.959 --> 00:39.917
JOEY,
DON'T BE JEALOUS

00:39.917 --> 00:41.917
JUST BECAUSE
SHE CAN DO THINGS

00:41.917 --> 00:44.208
THAT NO MAN HAS
EVER KNOWN BEFORE.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.333
OK, NOW YOU'RE
DISTURBING ME.

00:46.333 --> 00:49.875
IT'S A TELEVISION
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT
ATE A SMALL COUNTRY.

00:49.875 --> 00:53.417
THIS IS THE MOST BLATANT
DISPLAY OF CAPITALISM
I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:53.417 --> 00:54.625
DON'T BE THREATENED
BY SOMETHING

00:54.625 --> 00:56.375
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, JOEY.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.792
I'M GONNA GO GET
THE SALES GUY.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.667
AREN'T THERE BETTER THINGS YOU
CAN BE DOING WITH YOUR MONEY?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.041
WHAT, LIKE FUNDING
YOUR DRUG HABIT?

01:08.041 --> 01:09.792
NOW WE'RE TALKING.

01:09.792 --> 01:12.542
GRATUITOUS PURCHASES
ASIDE,

01:12.542 --> 01:13.750
I'M VERY IMPRESSED
WITH YOU, PACE.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.250
HEY, YOU PUT ANY FOOL
IN A SUIT AND HE CAN
CHANGE THE WORLD.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.500
JUST LOOK
AT TRADING PLACES.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.208
IT'S NOT THE SUITS, AND
IT'S NOT THE HIGH-TECH TOYS.

01:20.208 --> 01:22.583
IT'S HOW YOU GOT YOURSELF
TO THIS PLACE.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.792
I MEAN, LOOK HOW FAR
YOU'VE COME.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.542
NOT TOO FAR, I HOPE.

01:28.166 --> 01:29.625
ARE YOU REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT THAT?

01:29.625 --> 01:30.750
OF COURSE.

01:30.750 --> 01:31.875
I'D LIKE TO THINK
THAT I COULD GET BACK

01:31.875 --> 01:33.208
TO BEING THE PERSON
I USED TO BE,

01:33.208 --> 01:35.375
BECAUSE, IN MY OPINION,
HE WAS ACTUALLY
A PRETTY GOOD GUY.

01:35.375 --> 01:38.166
YOU STILL ARE, PACEY.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.583
LOOK, YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THIS MADCAP GENIUS

01:40.583 --> 01:42.750
JUST WAITING
FOR POTENTIAL TO KICK IN.

01:42.750 --> 01:46.583
IT JUST SO HAPPENED
TO KICK INTO OVERDRIVE.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.542
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

01:50.000 --> 01:50.959
THANK YOU.

01:50.959 --> 01:53.000
THAT MEANS A LOT
COMING FROM YOU, JO.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.083
BUT...

01:54.083 --> 01:55.917
IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA
SIT IN YOUR APARTMENT

01:55.917 --> 01:58.250
AND PAY HOMAGE TO THAT THING,
YOU'RE SORELY MISTAKEN.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.417
YOU GOTTA COME TONIGHT.
IT'S NOT A PARTY WITHOUT
YOU, YOU KNOW THAT.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.417
I KNOW.

02:01.417 --> 02:03.250
BELIEVE ME, I'M COMING.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.041
I MEAN, I'M IN DIRE NEED
OF CHEER AND LIBATIONS

02:06.041 --> 02:07.708
AFTER EDDIE UP AND DECIDED
TO MAKE SOMETHING OF HIMSELF.

02:07.708 --> 02:10.542
YEAH, YOU GOTTA QUIT
WITH THE WHOLE SUPPORTIVE
AND INSPIRATIONAL THING.

02:10.542 --> 02:11.458
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR YA.

02:11.458 --> 02:12.708
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

02:12.708 --> 02:15.792
NOW DON'T MAKE ME REGRET
ALL OF MY SENTIMENTAL PRIDE.

02:15.792 --> 02:16.458
I WON'T.

02:16.458 --> 02:17.083
SO LONG AS
YOU COME TONIGHT.

02:17.083 --> 02:18.959
IT'LL BE GOOD
FOR YOUR SOUL,

02:18.959 --> 02:21.375
AND IT REALLY WOULD
MEAN A LOT TO ME

02:21.375 --> 02:22.959
IF YOU COULD
JUST ACCEPT HER...

02:24.041 --> 02:26.083
OH, GOD.
AS ONE OF OUR OWN.

02:26.083 --> 02:27.542
CLOTHES DON'T FOOL ME.

02:27.542 --> 02:29.125
SAME OLD LOVABLE PUNK.

02:29.125 --> 02:31.708
I'M GONNA
GO CHECK OUT THE iPODS.

03:19.583 --> 03:21.834
BACK WALL, GUYS.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.583
OHHH.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.166
SHE IS AWESOME. WE'RE GONNA
PRAY TO HER EVERY NIGHT.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.625
IT'S A BOX, JACK.
IT'S A BIG BOX,

03:27.625 --> 03:28.000
AND SINCE WHEN HAVE
YOU BEEN SO INTERESTED

03:28.000 --> 03:29.750
IN BIG BOXES?

03:29.750 --> 03:31.375
SINCE PACEY HERE
STARTED SHARING THE WEALTH.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.041
THIS IS NOT GONNA BRING
YOU HAPPINESS, YOU KNOW.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.000
OH, I BEG TO DIFFER.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.417
SEE, DAVID'S HERE RIGHT NOW
TO CHECK OUT THE TV.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.125
OH, SO, WHAT, YOU'RE
GONNA GET LUCKY

03:39.125 --> 03:40.667
WITH THE TELEVISION?

03:40.667 --> 03:41.625
HI.

03:41.625 --> 03:42.959
HEY.
HEY.

03:42.959 --> 03:46.166
HOLY BIG-SCREEN, BATMAN.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.542
YOU WERE RIGHT.

03:47.542 --> 03:48.959
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

03:48.959 --> 03:51.375
HAVE YOU BOYS NO CONCERN

03:51.375 --> 03:54.083
FOR THE GENERAL
AESTHETIC QUALITY
OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS?

03:54.083 --> 03:55.959
THIS THING IS SO BIG,
IT COULD BLOCK THE SUN.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.250
SPARE ME THE MANIFESTO,
LINDLEY.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.834
THE QUALITY OF LIFE JUST
WENT UP 10 POINTS IN HERE.

03:58.834 --> 04:01.083
WOULD YA JUST...

04:01.083 --> 04:02.750
GIVE THE OLD GIRL A CHANCE?

04:02.750 --> 04:06.375
I'M SURE THAT SHE WILL
IMPRESS YOU WITH HER SKILLS.

04:06.375 --> 04:09.208
THE--THE STRENGTH OF THE
SOUND THAT COMES OUT OF HER,
IT JUST--

04:09.208 --> 04:12.000
IT FEELS LIKE IT'S
ENVELOPING YOUR WHOLE BODY.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.375
OH, IS EMMA'S BAND PLAYING
TONIGHT? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.375
NO. THE TV.

04:16.375 --> 04:18.583
LOVE THE TV.
TOUCH THE TV.

04:18.583 --> 04:19.708
AHH.
MOVING ON.

04:19.708 --> 04:20.458
NEXT SUBJECT.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.625
WHY ARE YOU HAVING
THIS PARTY ANYWAY?

04:22.625 --> 04:23.917
I MEAN, YOU AND JACK
HAVE BEEN LIVING HERE

04:23.917 --> 04:25.500
IN PRIVATE SQUALOR
FOR MONTHS NOW.

04:25.500 --> 04:25.834
SQUALOR.

04:25.834 --> 04:27.667
INTERESTING.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.041
WELL, WORK'S BEEN
GOING WELL, AND, UH,

04:29.041 --> 04:31.125
I JUST WANTED
TO SPREAD THE JOY.

04:31.125 --> 04:32.083
SO, LISTEN,

04:32.083 --> 04:34.083
I'M BRINGING C.J.
TO THIS PARTY.

04:35.417 --> 04:36.333
(SIGHS)

04:36.333 --> 04:37.166
C.J., THE DUDE
FROM THE CONCERT.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.250
YES, C.J., THE DUDE
FROM THE CONCERT,

04:39.250 --> 04:41.583
WHOSE FACE YOU INTRODUCED
TO THE BRICK WALL,

04:41.583 --> 04:43.542
WHICH LEADS ME
TO MY NEXT POINT--

04:43.542 --> 04:45.458
COULD YOU POSSIBLY
NOT PUNCH HIM TONIGHT?

04:45.458 --> 04:46.959
I WOULD NEVER.

04:46.959 --> 04:48.333
WELL, THAT'S REASSURING.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.750
UM, BUT I'M GONNA GO NOW,

04:49.750 --> 04:50.917
AND WHEN I RETURN,
I WILL HAVE C.J.,

04:50.917 --> 04:53.125
AND I WILL HAVE ICE.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.125
ICE, WHICH IS FOR DRINKS,
NOT FOR BOYS' BROKEN FACES.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.959
THANKS FOR
THE CLARIFICATION.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.792
HEY. SEE YA LATER
TONIGHT.

04:58.792 --> 04:59.792
TA.

04:59.792 --> 05:00.959
EMMA.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.792
(LAUGHS)

05:02.792 --> 05:05.875
OH, WHAT IN
THE QUEEN'S NAME IS THAT?

05:05.875 --> 05:08.500
THAT IS
TONIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENT

05:08.500 --> 05:11.000
AND EVERY GLORIOUS NIGHT
THEREAFTER.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.333
Jack: THIS IS BERTHA.

05:14.333 --> 05:14.875
NO.
ISN'T SHE PRETTY?

05:14.875 --> 05:17.250
SHE IS NOT PRETTY.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.208
SHE IS AN OVERSIZED HAG

05:18.208 --> 05:19.583
WHO'S TAKING UP
MY PRACTICE SPACE.

05:19.583 --> 05:20.959
DON'T TALK ABOUT BERTHA
LIKE THAT.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.375
WE CAN DISCUSS
REARRANGING LATER.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.000
WHAT--WHAT--

05:26.000 --> 05:28.375
WHAT IN THE QUEEN'S NAME
IS THAT?

05:28.708 --> 05:31.208
(LAUGHS) OH.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.125
SORRY. UM...

05:33.125 --> 05:33.625
THAT'S GUS.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.041
OH.

05:37.542 --> 05:38.583
MY FIANCE.

05:54.583 --> 05:56.834
HOW CAN YOU HELP
YOURSELF TODAY?

05:56.834 --> 05:59.041
HA HA. UM, ACTUALLY
I'M HERE TO--

05:59.041 --> 06:00.792
Audrey: DAWSON LEERY,

06:00.792 --> 06:03.875
YOU ARE A SIGHT
FOR SOBER EYES.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.166
HI!

06:05.166 --> 06:06.500
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.166
OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
THINK MY MESSAGE WAS A JOKE.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.375
YOU SOUNDED A LITTLE
TOO DESPERATE FOR IT
TO BE A JOKE.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.125
OH, WELL,
THANKS FOR NOT FLAKING,

06:13.125 --> 06:14.917
'CAUSE I KINDA
WOULDA DESERVED THAT.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.583
AH-CHOO!

06:17.583 --> 06:19.166
AH-CHOO!

06:19.166 --> 06:20.250
AH-CHOO!

06:20.250 --> 06:23.333
OH, BUT PLEASE TELL ME
THAT YOU BROUGHT ME
SOME NYQUIL

06:23.333 --> 06:25.917
'CAUSE I CAN JUST NOT
SHAKE THIS PESKY COLD.

06:25.917 --> 06:26.875
THE FIRST STEP
TO GETTING BETTER

06:26.875 --> 06:29.583
IS ALLOWING YOURSELF
TO ADMIT THAT YOU'RE SICK.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.083
THANKS, BETTY.

06:34.083 --> 06:37.333
OK, WELL, IT'S COOL
THAT YOU FORGOT
THE NYQUIL,

06:37.333 --> 06:38.166
WE'LL DEAL
WITH THAT LATER,

06:38.166 --> 06:39.542
BUT PLEASE, FOR THE
LOVE OF JOEY POTTER,

06:39.542 --> 06:41.250
TELL ME THAT
YOU BROUGHT ME
SOMETHING TO READ.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.000
A JANE  MAGAZINE,
HELL, I'D EVEN SETTLE
FOR MARTHA ANYTHING.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.166
ANYTHING BUT THE BIBLE,

06:45.166 --> 06:46.125
ALTHOUGH
IT WAS PRETTY COOL
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.917
PEOPLE STEAL
A LOT OF MATERIAL
FROM THE BIBLE.

06:48.917 --> 06:49.959
HAVE YOU
EVER NOTICED THAT?

06:50.542 --> 06:53.875
ARE YOU OK, AUDREY?

06:53.875 --> 06:57.000
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
TRUTH BE TOLD,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.959
I'VE BEEN...SMOKING
A LOT MORE THAN
THE AVERAGE GIRL,

06:59.959 --> 07:02.041
WELL, MORE THAN
THE AVERAGE GIRL WITHOUT
AN EATING DISORDER.

07:02.041 --> 07:04.291
YOU KNOW, THEY KIND OF
ENCOURAGE THAT HERE.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.375
YOU KNOW, THE SMOKING

07:05.375 --> 07:07.750
'CAUSE, LIKE,
THAT'S NOT GONNA
KILL YOU OR ANYTHING.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.333
ANYWAY...BYGONES.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.500
YOU OK, DAWSON?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.625
UH, WELL, SORTA.

07:14.625 --> 07:16.667
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN TODD'S
GUESTHOUSE FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS,

07:16.667 --> 07:19.458
WHICH HAS BEEN ITS OWN
KIND OF SOBRIETY NIGHTMARE.

07:19.458 --> 07:23.625
UH, WICKED DEAD  IS
GOING STRAIGHT TO CABLE,

07:23.625 --> 07:25.625
WHICH MEANS
TODD WON'T BE DIRECTING

07:25.625 --> 07:26.875
ANYTHING
IN THE NEAR FUTURE

07:26.875 --> 07:28.417
AND I PROBABLY WON'T EVER
GET ANOTHER SHOT AT THIS RATE.

07:28.417 --> 07:31.333
YEAH.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.792
I'M IN REHAB,
DAWSON.

07:32.792 --> 07:36.041
(LAUGHS)

07:36.041 --> 07:38.000
DID YOU REALLY NOT
BRING ME ANY MAGAZINES?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.834
I'M SORRY, I--

07:44.625 --> 07:46.333
DO YOU KNOW
WHO THAT IS?

07:46.333 --> 07:48.542
YEAH. IT'S THE BROAD
I LOST MY CIGARETTES TO

07:48.542 --> 07:49.875
LAST NIGHT
IN POKER GAME.

07:49.875 --> 07:50.959
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.166
THAT'S TONI STARK.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.291
SHE'S A PHENOMENALLY
SUCCESSFUL PRODUCER.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.333
SHE USED TO WORK FOR SPIELBERG'S
PRODUCTION COMPANY,

07:57.333 --> 07:58.458
THEN SHE LEFT
TO START HER OWN.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.792
SHE'S LIKE A MODERN
HOLLYWOOD LEGEND.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.667
OH, WELL, FINDING THOSE
IS LIKE SHOOTING FISH
IN A BARREL HERE,

08:01.667 --> 08:03.917
SO DON'T BLOW YOUR WAD
ON ONE SIGHTING,
OK, TIGER?

08:03.917 --> 08:05.959
DO YOU--

08:05.959 --> 08:07.750
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
I COULD LIKE TALK TO HER?

08:07.750 --> 08:09.291
I MEAN--I MEAN, I'D LOVE
TO TALK TO HER,

08:09.291 --> 08:10.959
BUT I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

08:10.959 --> 08:12.083
SHE'S GOT THIS REPUTATION
FOR BEING LIKE
A RENOWNED HARPY.

08:12.083 --> 08:16.125
YOU KNOW, LIKES TO EAT
WELL-MEANING TYPES
FOR BREAKFAST.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.917
WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY
HER DRUNKEN REPUTATION.

08:17.917 --> 08:18.500
I MEAN, SHE'S
GOT NO AMMO HERE,

08:18.500 --> 08:21.125
BUT, HELLO,
WHAT ABOUT ME?

08:21.125 --> 08:22.917
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
LIKE THE ONLY PERSON

08:22.917 --> 08:24.458
WHO'S BEEN COOL ENOUGH
TO COME VISIT ME HERE,

08:24.458 --> 08:26.166
AND NOW
YOU'RE GONNA DITCH ME?

08:26.166 --> 08:27.500
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.041
YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.333
LET'S--

08:30.333 --> 08:31.166
LET'S WORK THROUGH

08:31.166 --> 08:31.792
WHAT GOT YOU HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.958
NO.

08:35.958 --> 08:38.500
LET'S STALK
THE BURN-OUT.

08:43.542 --> 08:44.625
WHOSE PARTY DID
YOU SAY THIS WAS?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.041
I DIDN'T. FUNNY, THAT.
LET'S GO IN.

08:46.041 --> 08:46.667
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
COME ON NOW.

08:46.667 --> 08:49.500
I'M NOT ONE
FOR SURPRISES.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.375
OK, IT'S MY FRIEND
PACEY'S PARTY.

08:50.375 --> 08:53.208
PA--THAT DUDE
FROM THE CONCERT?

08:53.208 --> 08:54.208
YES, THE DUDE
FROM THE CONCERT,

08:54.208 --> 08:56.125
THE ONE WHO
INTRODUCED YOUR FACE
TO A BRICK WALL.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.375
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE GO IN THERE,

08:57.375 --> 08:58.667
DROP OFF THE ICE,
GO TO A MOVIE.

08:58.667 --> 08:59.667
THESE ARE SOME
OF MY BEST FRIENDS,

08:59.667 --> 09:01.000
AND IF YOU AND I
ARE GONNA DO THIS,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.708
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET TO KNOW THEM
SOONER OR LATER,

09:02.708 --> 09:04.041
SO LET'S JUST DO IT,
PLEASE?

09:09.875 --> 09:10.917
HELLO THERE.

09:15.166 --> 09:15.750
NICE TELEVISION.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.542
SEE? I TOLD YOU
IT WASN'T GONNA BE SO BAD.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.875
QUITE THE SHINDIG, PACE.
I'M IMPRESSED.

09:24.875 --> 09:25.834
WHY, THANK YOU.

09:25.834 --> 09:26.917
I OWE IT ALL
TO BERTHA.

09:26.917 --> 09:29.458
Joey: PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T NAME THE TELEVISION.

09:29.458 --> 09:30.417
OK.

09:30.417 --> 09:30.917
YOU WANT
A DRINK?

09:30.917 --> 09:33.542
WE HAVE...

09:33.542 --> 09:34.708
WATER, JUICE, COKE,

09:34.708 --> 09:36.834
THE GREEN GUNK THAT
EMMA DRINKS, BEER--

09:36.834 --> 09:40.041
MM, GIMME A DRINK.
SOMETHING FRUITY
AND MIND-NUMBING.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.708
DON'T GIMME THAT LOOK.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.417
WHAT LOOK?

09:45.417 --> 09:46.917
LIKE YOU'RE GOING
TO ASK ME WHO I AM

09:46.917 --> 09:47.542
AND WHAT I'VE DONE
TO JOEY POTTER.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.959
I WAS GONNA DO
NO SUCH THING.

09:49.959 --> 09:52.166
I WAS SIMPLY GONNA
MAKE YOU A DRINK.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.625
AND MAY I SAY THAT
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL TONIGHT.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.166
THANK YOU.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.917
I THOUGHT IT WAS
TIME FOR A SHOWER.

10:01.917 --> 10:02.750
(LAUGHS)

10:05.667 --> 10:07.959
YOU KNOW, I HEARD THAT
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING
SO GREAT FOR YOU LATELY,

10:07.959 --> 10:09.750
BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT
YOU'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS

10:09.750 --> 10:11.375
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS DO.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.083
HMM.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.792
YOU KNOW, I'LL
ALWAYS BE THE ONE

10:13.792 --> 10:16.583
TO WAKE UP EARLY,
TAKE THE EXAM,
GET OVER THE BOY,

10:16.583 --> 10:17.750
DRIVE THE ROOMMATE
TO REHAB, RIGHT?

10:17.750 --> 10:21.166
'CAUSE SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA DO ALL THAT,
RIGHT?

10:21.166 --> 10:22.291
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:22.291 --> 10:24.250
MAYBE TOMORROW
I WON'T DO IT

10:24.250 --> 10:26.458
AND
SOMEBODY ELSE WILL.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.375
SO JUST WHAT
WOULD YOU DO INSTEAD?

10:29.375 --> 10:31.291
WHAT IS THIS INSTEAD
YOU SPEAK OF?

10:31.291 --> 10:32.708
WELL...

10:32.708 --> 10:35.166
THIS IS A FAIRLY
SAFE PLACE FOR YOU, RIGHT?

10:35.166 --> 10:36.250
SO FEEL FREE.

10:36.250 --> 10:39.333
ENJOY YOURSELF.

10:40.458 --> 10:41.500
ALL RIGHT.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.875
THAT'S THE PLAN.
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.792
YOU KNOW, I JUST
KEEP WONDERING...

10:59.792 --> 11:01.250
WHEN HE'S GONNA
RETURN TO HIS ART.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.333
I MEAN, HE WAS
REALLY QUITE TALENTED.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.208
MM-HMM.
REALLY?

11:04.208 --> 11:06.125
I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS INTO
THAT SORT OF THING.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.542
MM-HMM.
REALLY?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.208
OH, MY GOSH.
THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT US
TOGETHER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.667
WELL...

11:11.667 --> 11:13.291
BEFORE.

11:13.291 --> 11:15.542
I MEAN, YOU'LL THINK
THIS IS FUNNY, BUT...

11:15.542 --> 11:16.500
JACK...

11:16.500 --> 11:18.166
WHEN I FIRST MET HIM...

11:18.166 --> 11:19.166
MM-HMM.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.333
HE WAS...

11:20.333 --> 11:23.708
SHY AND KINDA DORKY.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.166
SERIOUSLY.
(LAUGHS)

11:25.166 --> 11:26.125
I MEAN, TO BE HONEST,

11:26.125 --> 11:27.500
I NEVER WOULD'VE KNOWN
HE LIKED ME,

11:27.500 --> 11:28.875
EXCEPT FOR...

11:28.875 --> 11:30.250
THERE WAS
THAT ONE TIME

11:30.250 --> 11:31.500
I WAS SKETCHING HIM
FOR CLASS...

11:33.750 --> 11:34.208
HE GOT EXCITED.

11:34.208 --> 11:36.166
WAAAAAH.
NO.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.375
(LAUGHING)

11:39.500 --> 11:41.166
OOH, DAWSON,
GO DO IT NOW.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.083
DO WHAT?

11:43.083 --> 11:44.291
I DON'T REMEMBER
COMING UP WITH A PLAN.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.583
JUST FRIGGIN'
GO DO IT!

12:00.792 --> 12:01.834
SLIM PICKIN'S, HUH?

12:01.834 --> 12:06.208
ENTERTAINMENT'S SURE TOUGH
TO COME BY AROUND HERE.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.208
WHAT DO YOU  DO FOR FUN?

12:08.208 --> 12:09.708
ME? I JUST GOT HERE.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.959
WELL, I'D BE GLAD TO
SHOW YOU THE ROPES, UM...

12:11.959 --> 12:13.542
DAWSON.
DAWSON LEERY.

12:13.542 --> 12:17.834
YOU GOT NICE HANDS,
DAWSON LEERY.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.583
I'M TONI STARK.

12:19.583 --> 12:20.708
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

12:20.708 --> 12:22.166
YOU'RE...A GENIUS.

12:22.166 --> 12:24.542
YEAH.

12:24.542 --> 12:25.959
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:25.959 --> 12:28.542
I'M SORRY. YOU PROBABLY
CAME HERE FOR PRIVACY.

12:28.542 --> 12:31.500
NO. ACTUALLY I CAME HERE
TO STOP HAVING FUN,

12:31.500 --> 12:33.792
BUT I LOVE HEARING
HOW GREAT I WAS...

12:33.792 --> 12:35.083
10 YEARS AGO.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.834
YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU WERE
A FLASH IN THE PAN.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.500
SO ARE WE GONNA
GO SOMEWHERE OR WHAT?

12:41.500 --> 12:43.458
UM...

12:43.458 --> 12:44.542
(LAUGHS)

12:44.542 --> 12:46.583
I...UH,

12:46.583 --> 12:47.917
I'M SORRY.

12:47.917 --> 12:50.458
LOOK, THE THING IS
I'M STARTING OUT
IN THE INDUSTRY--

12:50.458 --> 12:52.291
LISTEN, BABY BIRD,

12:52.291 --> 12:54.959
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
TEASING A DRYING-OUT BROAD
WITH YOUR NAUGHTY BITS,

12:54.959 --> 12:57.792
BUT IT'S WORSE
TO TRY AND TALK
ABOUT THE BUSINESS

12:57.792 --> 12:59.250
WITH SOMEBODY
WHO'S CURRENTLY
OUT OF IT.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.583
SEE YA AROUND.

13:01.583 --> 13:06.333
(LAUGHS)
OH, MY GOD.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.125
DAWSON!

13:07.125 --> 13:09.000
(SIGHS)

13:12.625 --> 13:14.041
HEY, HOPE YOU'RE
NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING

13:14.041 --> 13:15.291
OF NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.417
NO. NO.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.041
(SIGHS)

13:19.041 --> 13:20.417
NO. NO. JUST LOOKIN'.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.417
SO IT'S
A GOOD PARTY, HUH?

13:21.417 --> 13:22.291
I THINK
IT'S A GOOD PARTY.

13:22.291 --> 13:24.458
ALL THESE DIFFERENT
TYPES OF PEOPLE MIXING

13:24.458 --> 13:26.166
AND WHAT NOT, AND--

13:26.166 --> 13:28.125
AND THERE'S BEEN
NO PUNCHING IN
OF C.J.'s FACE.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.375
THAT'S GOOD.
I LIKE THAT.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.291
YOU SEEM
A LITTLE JUMPY.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.291
DO YOU, UH, WANT A BEER
OR SOMETHING?

13:32.291 --> 13:34.208
NO, I'M GOIN' THE CLEAN
AND SOBER ROUTE TONIGHT,

13:34.208 --> 13:35.375
TAKIN' ONE
FOR THE C.J. TEAM.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.375
HE DOESN'T MIND IT
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE DRINK.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.125
IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S JUST EASIER THIS WAY.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.792
WHAT, LYING?

13:40.792 --> 13:43.083
NO, IT'S NOT LYING,
I MEAN, IT'S JUST--IT'S--

13:43.083 --> 13:46.625
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
AND IT'S PROBABLY
REALLY GOOD FOR ME, TOO.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.208
HEY.

13:52.208 --> 13:52.667
HI.

13:52.667 --> 13:53.625
HOW ARE YA, SLUGGER?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.291
DON'T WORRY.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

13:56.291 --> 13:57.625
YEAH, I NOTICED
THE LACK OF FISTICUFFS.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.000
THANK YOU
FOR BEING NICE TO HIM.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.917
IT'S ACTUALLY EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

14:00.917 --> 14:03.000
'CAUSE IT TURNS OUT
HE'S A PRETTY GOOD GUY.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
SO WE KISSED, WE MADE UP,
I OFFERED HIM A DRINK,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
AND EVERYTHING'S BEEN OK.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.917
HE REFUSED, RIGHT, WHEN
YOU OFFERED HIM THE DRINK?

14:08.917 --> 14:10.500
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WHO DOES THAT?

14:10.500 --> 14:13.208
OH, GOD. ALCOHOLICS.

14:13.208 --> 14:16.000
RECOVERING ALCOHOLICS
TEND NOT TO DRINK.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.333
WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE UNDER-AGE
ALCOHOLICS AROUND HERE?

14:18.333 --> 14:20.000
OK.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.917
I GOT IT.

14:20.917 --> 14:21.917
I'M ON
DAMAGE CONTROL,

14:21.917 --> 14:22.375
AND HAVE
YOU SEEN JOEY?

14:22.375 --> 14:25.125
YOU KNOW, C.J.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.667
I JUST--I REALLY THINK
IT'S GREAT

14:27.667 --> 14:29.500
HOW YOU'VE TURNED
JEN AROUND.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.834
BECAUSE BEFORE, BELIEVE ME,
I MEAN, SHE WAS--

14:31.834 --> 14:34.500
SHE WAS
A TROUBLED YOUNG LADY.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.959
SO SHE SAYS.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.041
SHE KILLED A GIRL ONCE.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.041
WHAT?

14:40.041 --> 14:41.375
ABBY MORGAN.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.000
KILLED HER WITH CHAMPAGNE.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.166
NO.
YOU WANT SOME?

14:46.166 --> 14:47.875
NO. NO.
DO YOU WANT SOME?

14:47.875 --> 14:49.417
I'M--I'M--
THIS IS--I'M--

14:49.417 --> 14:51.458
OOOH.
(LAUGHS)

14:51.458 --> 14:53.208
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

14:53.208 --> 14:53.625
SO...

14:53.625 --> 14:55.458
WHAT DO YOU SAY

14:55.458 --> 14:57.208
WE LEAVE THE NICE
MAN ALONE NOW,
SHALL WE?

14:57.208 --> 14:59.250
ABOUT THAT THING
EARLIER, I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.166
WHAT?

15:05.041 --> 15:06.041
THANK YOU.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.000
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
HE SEEMS
LIKE A NICE GUY.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.542
WHAT DOES C.J.
STAND FOR?

15:11.542 --> 15:13.041
COULDN'T TELL YA.

15:13.041 --> 15:16.125
AH, I HOPE THOSE
KIDS WORK IT OUT.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.333
HMM.

15:19.417 --> 15:20.375
PACEY.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.750
EVERYBODY'S
WORKING IT OUT.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.125
JEN AND C.J.,

15:27.125 --> 15:28.458
YOU KNOW,
THAT BRITISH GIRL

15:28.458 --> 15:31.750
AND THAT GROSS GUY.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.333
I'M JUST NO GOOD
AT THIS. I JUST--

15:36.333 --> 15:38.208
I PUSH PEOPLE AWAY.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.458
NO,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:39.458 --> 15:41.000
OH, NO?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.166
THEN WHY DO
THEY GO OUT TO SEA
OR MOVE ACROSS COUNTRY

15:43.166 --> 15:45.208
OR FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS
JUST BECAUSE
I TOLD THEM TO?

15:47.125 --> 15:50.291
THERE'S ALWAYS
SOMETHING BETTER
OUT THERE THAN ME.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.708
WHOA.
I THINK, PERHAPS

15:52.708 --> 15:54.208
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THIS THE WRONG WAY.

15:54.208 --> 15:58.625
MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'RE SUCH AN AMAZING WOMAN,

15:58.625 --> 16:01.667
YOU MAKE THESE GUYS
WANNA BE BETTER MEN.

16:02.792 --> 16:06.000
WELL,
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

16:06.583 --> 16:09.291
TRUE ENOUGH.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.750
(CHUCKLES) YEAH.

16:13.750 --> 16:14.750
(SIGHS) YEAH.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.041
WELL, DON'T
YOU LOOK SO GLUM.

16:17.041 --> 16:19.500
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY SUCKY LIFE.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.458
YOURS IS A SUCCESS.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.333
OH.

16:25.333 --> 16:28.041
I FORGOT.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.250
YOU'RE STILL
NOT OVER ME.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.458
(CHUCKLES) REALLY?

16:32.458 --> 16:35.125
OH, REMEMBER?

16:35.125 --> 16:37.125
CHRISTMAS DINNER
FROM HELL?

16:37.125 --> 16:38.834
RIGHT.
THAT WAS ONE OF
AUDREY'S ENLIGHTENED
COMMENTS.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.625
OF COURSE.
YOU'RE STILL
NOT OVER ME.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.583
THAT MUST SUCK.

16:43.583 --> 16:44.458
OH, IT DOES.

16:44.458 --> 16:47.208
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE HARDSHIPS I GO THROUGH

16:47.208 --> 16:48.000
TRYING TO MAINTAIN
A FRIENDSHIP

16:48.000 --> 16:50.166
WITH A DREAM GIRL
SUCH AS YOURSELF.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.166
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.125
GETS LONELY.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.208
IT DOES. I CRY MYSELF
TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT,

16:54.208 --> 16:54.708
BUT JACK AND I CUDDLE.

16:54.708 --> 16:56.625
THAT EASES THE PAIN.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.834
HE'S VERY LOVING.

16:58.834 --> 17:02.166
(LAUGHS)

17:02.166 --> 17:03.125
OH, PACE.

17:04.165 --> 17:05.583
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:05.583 --> 17:07.333
I AM A GOOD CATCH.

17:51.417 --> 17:52.667
I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.708
I MEAN, WHEN DID YOU
STOP GOING TO SCHOOL?

17:54.708 --> 17:55.834
UM...

17:55.834 --> 17:57.750
THE END
OF THE SEMESTER.

17:58.542 --> 17:59.708
THE BAND'S REALLY
TAKING OFF, JACK,

17:59.708 --> 18:01.708
AND I JUST--

18:01.708 --> 18:04.041
I COULDN'T KEEP UP
WITH THE REQUIREMENTS.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.166
WHEN AM I GONNA NEED
TO KNOW THE ORIGIN

18:06.166 --> 18:08.667
OF THE BAROQUE PERIOD
ANYWAY?

18:08.667 --> 18:11.125
IT'S TOTALLY LACKING
INSPIRATION.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.083
TOTALLY.

18:13.834 --> 18:14.458
AHEM.

18:14.458 --> 18:17.500
SO, GUS...

18:18.000 --> 18:19.583
YOU STILL
IN SCHOOL?

18:19.583 --> 18:22.041
NO NEED.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.625
I'M GONNA
BE A ROADIE FOR
THE LITTLE LADY.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.583
(LAUGHS) NO. NO.
HE'S JUST SAYING THAT. NO.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.375
HE'S ACTUALLY, UM,
A VERY BRILLIANT PIANIST.

18:28.375 --> 18:33.500
HE, UM, PLAYS IN A POOL HALL
ON--ON THURSDAY NIGHTS.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.917
IT'S REALLY GOOD STUFF.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.291
WICKED.

18:40.708 --> 18:43.333
YEAH. OK, UM...

18:43.333 --> 18:46.417
ARE YOU SURE YOU THOUGHT
THIS MARRIAGE THING THROUGH?

18:46.417 --> 18:48.917
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE, GUS,
WE JUST MET TONIGHT, BUT, UH,

18:48.917 --> 18:52.250
IT'S MOVIN' AWFUL QUICKLY.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.125
YEAH, THAT'S
SORT OF THE POINT, JACK.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.917
MY VISA RAN OUT AS SOON
AS I QUIT SCHOOL,

18:58.917 --> 18:59.583
WHICH MEANS I HAVE
NO RIGHT TO BE HERE

18:59.583 --> 19:01.667
UNLESS I...

19:01.667 --> 19:03.542
MARRY
SOME YANKEE BASTARD.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.792
ACTUALLY GUS
HAS BEEN VERY AGREEABLE
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

19:06.792 --> 19:08.125
HAVEN'T YA, GUS?

19:08.125 --> 19:11.375
RIGHT ON,
BABY MAMA.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.708
SO I'M GOING TO GO, UM,
FETCH SOMETHING TO DRINK.

19:14.708 --> 19:16.208
CAN I GET SOMETHING
FOR ANYONE?

19:16.208 --> 19:17.625
YEAH, I'D LIKE A--
I'D LIKE A BEER.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.542
OK.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.041
AND MAYBE
SOME CHIPS.

19:22.542 --> 19:23.458
AND MAYBE, UH...

19:23.458 --> 19:26.417
MASH THE CHIPS UP
INSIDE A SANDWICH.

19:26.417 --> 19:28.458
OK.

19:32.625 --> 19:34.250
SO...

19:34.250 --> 19:35.583
GUS,

19:35.583 --> 19:38.959
DID YA JUST, YOU KNOW,
OFFER YOUR SERVICES TO HER,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

19:38.959 --> 19:42.041
IT'S A BIG SACRIFICE JUST,

19:42.041 --> 19:43.792
YOU KNOW, GETTIN' MARRIED
THIS YOUNG AND ALL.

19:43.792 --> 19:44.959
SO--

19:44.959 --> 19:46.208
YEAH, I WAS
LED TO BELIEVE

19:46.208 --> 19:46.959
THAT HAVING
OTHER WOMEN
IN THE BEDROOM

19:46.959 --> 19:49.667
WOULDN'T EXACTLY
BE OFF LIMITS.

19:49.667 --> 19:53.500
PLUS, IT'S
NICE COMPENSATION.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.542
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:54.542 --> 19:57.291
FREE ROOM AND BOARD,
MAN.

19:57.291 --> 19:58.583
PLUS, SHE SAID
SHE'D COOK FOR ME.

19:58.583 --> 20:01.333
UH...

20:01.333 --> 20:02.625
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S NOT EXACTLY A COOK.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.500
UM...

20:04.500 --> 20:05.667
SHE JUST THROWS STUFF
IN A BLENDER,

20:05.667 --> 20:06.792
AND THEN SHE
JUST KINDA HOPES--

20:06.792 --> 20:08.208
WHATEVER, MAN.

20:08.208 --> 20:08.667
SHE'S GOT
A NICE RACK.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.542
YEAH, SHE--

20:10.542 --> 20:11.750
SAY, UH,

20:11.750 --> 20:12.417
ARE YOU TWO GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER?

20:14.667 --> 20:15.333
UNFORTUNATELY.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.083
YEAH, NO,
YOUR OLD MAN'S COOL.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.542
DOESN'T EVEN SEEM
ALL THAT GAY.

20:26.708 --> 20:29.500
YEAH.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.166
OK. UM...

20:31.166 --> 20:32.458
SEE YOU KIDS LATER.
I'M JUST GOING TO--

20:35.458 --> 20:36.333
STAY RIGHT HERE.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.041
Dawson:
ALL RIGHT, WAIT,

20:42.041 --> 20:44.166
WHY ARE WE
STILL DOING THIS?

20:44.166 --> 20:45.291
WEREN'T YOU JUST
BLATANTLY TELLING ME

20:45.291 --> 20:46.375
WHAT A MISERABLE
FAILURE I WAS?

20:46.375 --> 20:47.333
LOOK, DAWSON LEERY,

20:47.333 --> 20:48.500
IF THERE IS ONE THING
I HAVE LEARNED IN REHAB,

20:48.500 --> 20:50.458
WELL, OTHER THAN
SOME KILLER CAT'S CRADLE,

20:50.458 --> 20:52.375
IS THAT YOU HAVE
TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

20:52.375 --> 20:55.083
YOU ARE YOUR OWN
WORST ENEMY AND ALL THAT.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.542
YOU'RE NOT
TOO CONVINCING.

20:56.542 --> 20:57.041
(SIGHS) COME ON.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.291
YOU ARE SO MUCH BETTER

20:59.291 --> 21:00.708
THAN ALL THE WANNABES
I GREW UP WITH.

21:00.708 --> 21:03.625
I MEAN, OK, SO YOU
MADE A COLOSSAL FOOL
OUT OF YOURSELF

21:03.625 --> 21:04.250
IN FRONT OF
SOME PRODUCER.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.458
I SAY...
WHY NOT DO IT AGAIN?

21:07.458 --> 21:08.667
YOU'RE NOT
JUST ENCOURAGING ME

21:08.667 --> 21:09.875
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
IN REHAB FOR A MONTH

21:09.875 --> 21:11.125
AND YOU'RE BORED
OUT OF YOUR MIND,
ARE YOU?

21:11.125 --> 21:12.583
DAWSON,
GIVE A GIRL A BREAK

21:12.583 --> 21:14.500
AND DANCE,
MONKEY, DANCE!

21:14.500 --> 21:16.500
ALL RIGHT, SHE WENT IN
THAT ROOM RIGHT THERE.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.583
OOOH.

21:21.417 --> 21:22.750
HEY, GUYS.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.083
COME ON IN.
DON'T BE SHY.
WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.083
ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW, WE'RE--

21:25.083 --> 21:26.291
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:26.291 --> 21:28.875
HONEY, THIS IS
GONNA BE GOOD FOR US.

21:28.875 --> 21:30.583
COME ON, GUYS,
MAKE SOME ROOM.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.333
THANK YOU.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.125
THANKS.

21:40.792 --> 21:42.750
AAAAAH!

21:42.750 --> 21:44.333
Guys: ONE, TWO...

21:44.333 --> 21:47.583
DO WE REALLY HAVE
TO CO-HABITATE
WITH THIS GUY?

21:47.583 --> 21:50.959
WHOA. WHOA. SHE DIDN'T
MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

21:50.959 --> 21:51.959
Guys: ...NINE--

21:51.959 --> 21:55.583
EECH. (LAUGHS) WHOO!

21:55.583 --> 21:59.667
WELL, YEAH, I THINK
IT'S PART OF THE
MARITAL-BLISS DEAL.

21:59.667 --> 22:00.375
I MEAN,
FREE ROOM AND BOARD,

22:00.375 --> 22:02.917
THE OCCASIONAL
UNWANTED GROPING,

22:02.917 --> 22:03.959
IT'S THE ONLY REASON
HE'S DOING IT.

22:03.959 --> 22:05.625
YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.291
WHAT,
YOU'RE SHOCKED?

22:07.291 --> 22:10.708
I--I--I JUST
DON'T GET IT, I GUESS.

22:10.708 --> 22:11.708
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

22:11.708 --> 22:13.250
I UNDERSTAND
EMMA'S IN A BIND,

22:13.250 --> 22:14.250
BUT, YOU KNOW,
SHE COULDA SAID
SOMETHING.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.500
AND THIS CREEP.
YEAH, I KNOW.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.959
I MEAN, WHO MARRIES
SOMEONE THEY DON'T LOVE?

22:17.959 --> 22:20.375
THAT KINDA CREEP.

22:21.333 --> 22:24.250
KINDA CREEP THAT'S
KINDA GIVIN' UP HOPE.

22:24.250 --> 22:26.750
WHEN YOU STOP
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

22:26.750 --> 22:32.959
IT REALLY MUST SUCK
TO BE HIM.

22:32.959 --> 22:36.208
SO YOU HAVIN' FUN?

22:36.208 --> 22:37.834
OH, YEAH.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.542
YEAH.

22:39.542 --> 22:40.959
SO YOU'RE DRINKING?

22:40.959 --> 22:43.583
YOU KNOW, I'D BE MUCH
MORE INCLINED TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION

22:43.583 --> 22:44.625
IF YOU WEREN'T
LOOKIN' AT ME

22:44.625 --> 22:47.500
LIKE I JUST...KILLED
GRAMS DRUNK DRIVING.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.291
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

22:48.291 --> 22:50.500
WELL, YOUR FRIEND
OFFERED ME A DRINK,

22:50.500 --> 22:52.208
AND IT SEEMED RUDE
TO SAY NO, SO--

22:52.208 --> 22:54.125
SO THAT'S IT?

22:54.125 --> 22:56.500
YEARS OF SOBRIETY
SHOT TO HELL

22:56.500 --> 22:58.000
OVER A QUESTION
OF ETIQUETTE

22:58.000 --> 22:59.250
WITH A GUY WHO THREATENED
TO PUNCH YOU IN YOUR FACE?

22:59.250 --> 23:01.750
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

23:01.750 --> 23:03.250
WELL,
THANK GOD FOR THAT.

23:03.250 --> 23:04.250
NO, I JUST--
I DIDN'T WANT

23:04.250 --> 23:05.542
TO GET INTO IT
WITH A STRANGER.

23:05.542 --> 23:06.792
YOU KNOW...

23:06.792 --> 23:08.208
BUT THANKS
FOR TELLING HIM,
INCIDENTALLY.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.333
TELLING HIM WHAT?

23:09.333 --> 23:10.375
THAT I DON'T DRINK,
APPARENTLY.

23:10.375 --> 23:11.375
NOW HE'S APOLOGIZING
TO ME

23:11.375 --> 23:13.125
LIKE I'M DYING
OR SOMETHING.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.208
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT IS A DISEASE.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.583
I KNOW THAT,
JEN.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.291
I, UH,
I TRAINED YOU.
REMEMBER?

23:18.291 --> 23:21.125
Y-YEAH, NO,
I KNOW. I KNOW,

23:21.125 --> 23:22.375
SO WHY IS THIS
COMING UP?

23:22.375 --> 23:25.041
BECAUSE FOR AS LONG
AS I'VE KNOWN YOU,

23:25.041 --> 23:27.208
YOU'VE OPERATED ON
A CERTAIN SET OF RULES

23:27.208 --> 23:29.166
TO THE POINT WHERE I DIDN'T
THINK THAT A DAY WOULD GO BY

23:29.166 --> 23:30.708
IF YOU WEREN'T STICKING
TO THE C.J. PLAN.

23:30.708 --> 23:32.000
WELL, DID IT
EVER OCCUR TO YOU

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
THAT MAYBE I REALIZED
I WAS TOO STRICT
WITH MYSELF?

23:35.375 --> 23:36.500
THAT MAYBE I WOULDN'T
EVEN BE HERE RIGHT NOW

23:36.500 --> 23:39.792
IF I WAS STICKING TO
THE SO-CALLED C.J. PLAN?

23:39.792 --> 23:41.166
WELL, IF
THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN,

23:41.166 --> 23:41.917
THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T BE HERE WITH ME.

23:41.917 --> 23:43.917
WHY? BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE

23:43.917 --> 23:45.583
FOR THE PAST HOUR
CONSIDERING ON WHETHER
OR NOT TO TAKE A DRINK?

23:48.250 --> 23:50.625
I'D BE MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND JOEY
OVER THERE.

23:50.625 --> 23:51.959
SHE TRIED TO TELL ME
YOU KILLED SOMEBODY.

23:51.959 --> 23:54.166
WAIT, I'M SORRY,
SO YOU--YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING?

23:54.166 --> 23:55.625
OH, IS THAT GONNA
MAGICALLY CHANGE

23:55.625 --> 23:56.792
ALL THE CONCLUSIONS
YOU JUST JUMPED TO?

23:56.792 --> 23:57.959
WELL, YES.

23:57.959 --> 23:59.750
WELL, IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY, JEN.

23:59.750 --> 24:01.291
YEAH, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT,
FINE.

24:01.291 --> 24:02.875
JUST LIKE
I'VE BEEN THINKING

24:02.875 --> 24:04.166
ABOUT TRYING SOME
NORMALCY WITH YOU,

24:04.166 --> 24:06.000
BUT APPARENTLY
YOU FIND THAT
WILDLY INSULTING.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.917
NO. NO, LOOK,
I JUST DON'T WANT--

24:07.917 --> 24:10.250
I JUST DON'T WANT
WHATEVER HAPPENS BETWEEN US

24:10.250 --> 24:12.583
TO BE DETRIMENTAL
TO EITHER OF US.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.667
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET
OUTTA SOMETHING HERE?

24:14.667 --> 24:15.750
IF YOU ARE,
JUST TELL ME.

24:15.750 --> 24:16.583
NO, I AM NOT TRYING
TO GET OUT OF ANYTHING.

24:16.583 --> 24:19.417
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M GETTING INTO.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.959
WELL, THEN
WHY ARE YOU MAKING EXCUSES
FOR WHY THIS WON'T WORK?

24:21.959 --> 24:27.333
I MEAN,
IT'S PRETTY HYPOCRITICAL
GIVEN OUR HISTORY, ISN'T IT?

24:29.458 --> 24:30.667
Counselor:
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

24:32.250 --> 24:34.291
(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
MY NAME IS PINKY.

24:34.291 --> 24:38.250
THEY CALL ME THAT
BECAUSE A FERRET
BIT OFF MY PINKY TOE

24:38.250 --> 24:41.250
WHEN I WAS 10, AND THAT IS
WHEN I TURNED TO THE DRINK.

24:41.917 --> 24:43.083
Counselor: OK.

24:43.083 --> 24:44.458
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'D LIKE
TO TELL YOUR FRIEND HERE?

24:44.458 --> 24:47.083
OH, HE IS MORE
THAN JUST A FRIEND,

24:47.083 --> 24:48.083
MORE THAN
JUST A COUSIN.

24:48.083 --> 24:49.667
WE GOT MARRIED
REAL YOUNG.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.625
RIGHT AFTER
THE SECOND BABY, WAS IT?

24:51.625 --> 24:52.667
AND THEN
THERE WERE SOME MORE,

24:52.667 --> 24:54.166
BUT I LOST TRACK.

24:54.166 --> 24:56.834
THEY'RE WITH MOM NOW
IN VEGAS,

24:56.834 --> 24:59.834
BUT DAWSON HERE, HE WAS
ALWAYS REAL GOOD TO ME.

24:59.834 --> 25:02.542
EVEN WHEN I BEAT HIM
BECAUSE HE KNEW
THAT I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

25:02.542 --> 25:06.208
HE KNEW IT WAS JUST
THE ALCOHOL TALKIN', RIGHT?

25:06.208 --> 25:09.000
YOU DID DO SOME THINGS
THAT WERE MORE VIOLENT
THAN THAT.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.375
WELL, LIKE WHAT, HONEY?

25:10.375 --> 25:12.375
WELL, HOW 'BOUT THE TIME
YOU DROVE THE CAR
THROUGH THE HOUSE

25:12.375 --> 25:13.375
AND DAMN NEAR
KILLED US ALL?

25:13.375 --> 25:14.500
HE'S RIGHT
ABOUT THE CAR. YEAH.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.667
THERE WERE SOME THINGS
THAT I DID

25:17.667 --> 25:21.333
THAT I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE
IF I WEREN'T DRINKIN'.

25:21.333 --> 25:26.333
WHAT OTHER THINGS,
FINGY?

25:26.333 --> 25:29.000
WELL...

25:29.000 --> 25:31.417
LIKE TELLIN' PEOPLE THINGS
THEY DIDN'T NEED TO HEAR

25:31.417 --> 25:34.000
JUST 'CAUSE I WANTED TO SEE
THE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.375
YOU KNOW, PUSHIN' PEOPLE
AWAY WHO WERE JUST
TRYIN' TO HELP ME.

25:37.375 --> 25:40.375
DAWSON HERE, HE WAS ALWAYS...

25:40.375 --> 25:43.166
REAL QUIET ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.417
NOT JUDGMENTAL, REALLY,
JUST, YOU KNOW,

25:45.417 --> 25:47.667
KEPT PICKIN' ME UP
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

25:50.458 --> 25:52.375
AND WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE
HE DID THAT?

25:52.375 --> 25:54.083
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.291
I THINK HE'S JUST...

25:56.291 --> 25:59.959
THE KINDA GUY WHO ALWAYS
BELIEVES THE BEST IN PEOPLE.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.500
AND HE DESERVED MORE
THAN JUST...

26:02.500 --> 26:04.750
THE DESTRUCTION
OF HIS PROPERTY, I SUPPOSE.

26:06.458 --> 26:08.834
IT'S OK, THOUGH.
WE CAN FIX THAT.

26:08.834 --> 26:11.458
(WHISPERING)
BUT I COULD'VE
REALLY HURT YOU.

26:11.458 --> 26:14.625
YEAH, BUT I THINK
YOU NEEDED TO HIT
ROCK BOTTOM

26:14.625 --> 26:15.625
BEFORE YOU SNAPPED
OUT OF IT.

26:15.625 --> 26:17.166
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
HIT ROCK BOTTOM

26:17.166 --> 26:18.667
UNTIL A COUPLE
OF WEEKS AFTER THAT.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.708
MAYBE YOU JUST NEEDED
TO HIT IT REALLY HARD.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.834
(LAUGHING)

26:25.041 --> 26:28.208
(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
DO YOU THINK...
THAT THERE IS STILL A HOUSE

26:28.208 --> 26:30.250
FOR ME TO COME HOME TO

26:30.250 --> 26:32.625
AFTER ALL THE CONSTRUCTION'S
DONE AND WHAT NOT?

26:32.625 --> 26:34.000
I PROMISE.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.166
OH!

26:36.166 --> 26:38.708
DAWSON,
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER BABY.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.375
(APPLAUSE)

26:43.375 --> 26:47.000
LISTEN, I'M ALL FOR MAKIN'
A MOCKERY OF REHAB,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.333
BUT CAN WE PLEASE
MOVE THIS ALONG?

26:48.333 --> 26:50.000
BLONDIE OVER HERE
IS FROM BEVERLY HILLS,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.959
AND SHE TRIED TO TAKE ME
FOR 2 PACKS LAST NIGHT,

26:51.959 --> 26:54.166
AND HER BOYFRIEND HERE IS,
I DON'T KNOW, A KEY GRIP.

26:54.166 --> 26:55.583
IS THIS TRUE?

26:55.583 --> 26:57.708
ACTUALLY I WAS ASSISTANT
TO THE DIRECTOR.

26:57.708 --> 26:59.166
I ENDED UP DIRECTING
THE RE-SHOOTS MYSELF,

26:59.166 --> 27:00.792
AND, TONI, IF YOU'D ALLOW ME
TO SHOW YOU MY REEL--

27:00.792 --> 27:03.250
OK, THAT'LL BE
QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.834
YOU TWO OBVIOUSLY
DON'T BELONG HERE.

27:04.834 --> 27:06.834
(GASPS)
DO YOU MEAN I'M CURED?

27:06.834 --> 27:08.333
NO, I MEAN YOU'RE
ON DISH DUTY TONIGHT.

27:08.333 --> 27:10.291
I'LL TELL BETTY.
NOW, PLEASE,

27:10.291 --> 27:11.750
LET US CONDUCT
THIS SESSION IN PEACE.

27:11.750 --> 27:12.917
SORRY.

27:14.208 --> 27:16.375
BUH-BYE NOW.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.500
IT WENT WELL.

27:25.667 --> 27:28.500
YOU ARE KIDDING ME
WITH THIS, RIGHT, JOEY?

27:28.500 --> 27:29.750
Joey: I MOST
CERTAINLY
AM NOT.

27:29.750 --> 27:30.792
NOW DON'T BE
A SPOIL SPORT.

27:30.792 --> 27:31.625
COME ON.

27:31.625 --> 27:36.291
OK, FINE, BUT I--I'M
NOT KISSING HIM.

27:36.291 --> 27:38.250
WELL,
WHAT'S FAIR
IS FAIR, RIGHT?

27:38.250 --> 27:40.125
COME ON, GUSTAV,

27:40.125 --> 27:42.000
SPIN.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.417
Joey: NEW RULE--

27:59.417 --> 28:01.375
NO TONGUE.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.792
Jen: NO, NO, NO, NO.
WHAT'S FAIR IS FAIR,

28:02.792 --> 28:06.291
AND DON'T MESS WITH ME
BECAUSE I'VE KILLED BEFORE.

28:06.291 --> 28:08.500
(WHISPERING)
I KNOW.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.041
SEE?

28:11.667 --> 28:13.542
Gus: NO TONGUE?

28:13.542 --> 28:14.917
SCREW THAT.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.291
OK.

28:31.291 --> 28:32.291
WELL?

28:39.542 --> 28:41.041
JACK!

29:04.375 --> 29:04.875
OH.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.208
Joey: WAIT.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.834
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.250
YOU GUYS GET TO KISS
ALL THE TIME.

29:25.250 --> 29:26.291
WHAT'S THE FUN IN THAT?

29:26.291 --> 29:28.834
NOT TONIGHT. THERE'S
RULES TO BE FOLLOWED, YEAH?

29:28.834 --> 29:30.166
OH, SHUT UP.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.417
David: OK.

29:42.417 --> 29:44.083
UGH, YEAH.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.417
I'M A LITTLE THIRSTY.
DO YOU NEED A--

29:45.417 --> 29:46.417
OK.
YEAH, LET'S.

29:46.417 --> 29:47.417
Joey: OH, HEY, WHOA.

29:47.417 --> 29:48.917
THIS ISN'T LIKE...

29:48.917 --> 29:50.333
7 MINUTES IN HEAVEN.

29:50.333 --> 29:51.542
YOU GUYS
HAVE TO COME BACK.

29:51.542 --> 29:53.750
YOU JUST WANNA KISS JEN.

29:53.750 --> 29:54.792
OK, REGARDLESS,

29:54.792 --> 29:56.375
THEY FORFEIT THEIR TURN.

30:06.708 --> 30:07.125
MMM.

30:07.125 --> 30:10.417
WELL...

30:12.250 --> 30:13.708
♪ DOO-DOO
DOO-DOO ♪

30:16.333 --> 30:19.041
ALL RIGHT.

30:19.041 --> 30:20.792
(WHISPERING)
Lay one on me,
Pace.

30:24.333 --> 30:26.125
OH!
(CRASH)

30:27.125 --> 30:29.041
Pacey:
OH, YOU'RE GONNA DIE!

30:31.875 --> 30:33.917
I JUST--
I JUST WANTED TO SEE

30:33.917 --> 30:35.250
HOW MUCH WEIGHT
IT WOULD HOLD.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.583
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
I DIDN'T--

30:36.583 --> 30:38.333
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

30:38.333 --> 30:39.458
I WILL KILL YOU.
I WILL KILL YOU FOR THIS!

30:39.458 --> 30:40.667
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!

30:40.667 --> 30:42.291
AH! AH! AH!
AH! AAAAH!

30:42.291 --> 30:44.708
IDIOT!

30:44.708 --> 30:45.542
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

30:45.542 --> 30:48.500
NO! NO! NO!
KILL YOU!

30:48.500 --> 30:49.166
WHAT ABOUT
MY STUFF?

30:49.166 --> 30:50.542
OH, I'LL THROW IT
ON THE CURB.

30:50.542 --> 30:51.542
YEAH.
OK, BUT--

30:51.542 --> 30:52.583
THE WEDDING IS OFF.
UM, WE--

30:52.583 --> 30:53.333
WE HAVEN'T
DONE IT YET.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.708
YEAH, I'M AWARE
OF THAT, THANK YOU.

30:54.708 --> 30:55.667
OK.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.291
OH, BERTHA.

30:57.291 --> 30:58.667
(CRYING)
OH, NO.

30:58.667 --> 31:00.000
JEEZ!
(ELECTRICAL SNAPS)

31:01.834 --> 31:04.041
OH, I'M GONNA KILL
THAT LITTLE BASTARD.

31:04.041 --> 31:06.083
WANNA PLAY SARDINES?

31:06.583 --> 31:08.375
(THUD)

31:12.000 --> 31:13.667
SO THEY'RE REALLY GONNA
PUT YOU ON DISH DUTY, HUH?

31:13.667 --> 31:17.542
OH, PLEASE,
THAT'S A GODSEND.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.041
IT GETS ME OUT
OF KUMBAYA-ING
FOR THE NIGHT.

31:19.041 --> 31:20.375
WELL, WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO GIVE US SO MANY KIDS?

31:20.375 --> 31:21.625
WHATEVER!

31:21.625 --> 31:23.250
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO GET ALL EARNEST

31:23.250 --> 31:25.917
WITH THE BAG LADY
ABOUT THE NATURE
OF THE BIZ?

31:25.917 --> 31:27.625
(LAUGHS)

31:27.625 --> 31:28.375
OHH.

31:28.375 --> 31:30.000
(SIGHS)

31:30.000 --> 31:35.458
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T
ENTIRELY FICTIONAL,

31:35.458 --> 31:36.708
THE THERAPY SESSION.

31:36.708 --> 31:39.166
I WAS FEELING
LIKE THERE WAS SOME

31:39.166 --> 31:40.333
HARDCORE HEALING
GOING ON IN THERE.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.250
GOOD.

31:41.250 --> 31:43.375
JUST SUCKS YOU HAD
TO GET IN TROUBLE TO DO IT.

31:43.375 --> 31:45.792
DAWSON.

31:45.792 --> 31:48.166
STALKING SOME WOMAN
THROUGH THE HALLWAYS

31:48.166 --> 31:50.166
AND CRASHING
A THERAPY SESSION

31:50.166 --> 31:51.875
WAS MORE FUN THAN I
EVER COULD'VE IMAGINED.

31:51.875 --> 31:54.333
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT A RELIEF IT WAS

31:54.333 --> 31:55.542
TO JUST...

31:55.542 --> 31:57.417
NOT TALK ABOUT MYSELF

31:57.417 --> 31:59.417
AND MY PROBLEMS ALL DAY.

31:59.417 --> 32:03.542
AND DARNED IF IT
DIDN'T END UP HELPING
MY PROBLEMS OUT ANYWAY.

32:03.542 --> 32:05.208
HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.083
I KNOW.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.041
YOU SEEM A LITTLE
LESS SELF-ABSORBED

32:08.041 --> 32:09.208
THAN
WHEN YOU GOT HERE.

32:09.208 --> 32:11.208
YOU BETTER
GET YOURSELF BACK
TO L.A. PROPER FAST.

32:11.208 --> 32:12.750
YEAH, REALLY.

32:12.750 --> 32:13.917
I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK IT WAS

32:13.917 --> 32:15.583
JUST SEEING SOMEBODY
I ADMIRE SO MUCH

32:15.583 --> 32:16.667
GIVE UP ON LIFE
LIKE THAT.

32:16.667 --> 32:19.000
I DON'T KNOW, I MIGHT BE
FLOUNDERING FOR MY NEXT MOVE,

32:19.000 --> 32:20.083
BUT I'M NOT THAT BAD.

32:20.083 --> 32:23.333
DAWSON, I HAVEN'T
GIVEN UP ON LIFE.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.166
I'M TALKING
ABOUT TONI STARK.

32:25.166 --> 32:26.667
OH. RIGHT.

32:26.667 --> 32:27.625
(GIGGLES)

32:27.625 --> 32:29.041
SEE? YOU'RE GOOD.

32:29.041 --> 32:32.125
THE NEXT TIME YOU COME,
YOU BRING ME NYQUIL.

32:32.125 --> 32:33.750
THERE DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE TO BE A NEXT TIME.

32:33.750 --> 32:34.750
YOU'RE
ALMOST OUTTA HERE.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.250
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S LIKE...

32:36.250 --> 32:37.667
AS MUCH AS
I HATE IT HERE,

32:37.667 --> 32:38.792
I'M SORTA SCARED

32:38.792 --> 32:40.834
MORE OF WHAT'S
BEYOND THE GATE

32:40.834 --> 32:43.959
'CAUSE IT'S ALL
KIND OF A BLUR, BUT...

32:43.959 --> 32:45.000
I DON'T THINK
I LEFT THINGS

32:45.000 --> 32:46.750
ON THE BEST OF TERMS
OUT THERE.

32:46.750 --> 32:49.041
IT CAN ALL
BE JUST LIKE IT WAS.

32:49.041 --> 32:51.291
MINUS THE BAD PARTS.

32:51.291 --> 32:52.959
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

32:52.959 --> 32:55.125
I KINDA
DON'T THINK I CAN,

32:55.125 --> 32:56.750
BUT...

32:56.750 --> 32:58.083
KINDA GLAD
ABOUT THAT.

33:01.542 --> 33:03.708
(GIGGLES)
COME HERE.

33:05.792 --> 33:07.750
(SIGHS) THANK YOU.

33:09.792 --> 33:11.959
BYE.

33:11.959 --> 33:13.333
SEE YA.

33:21.875 --> 33:25.500
SO, UH, YOU REALLY
USED TO GO OUT WITH,
UH, JOEY, HUH?

33:25.792 --> 33:28.000
UH...AHEM.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.834
WHO HAVE YOU BEEN
TALKING TO TONIGHT?

33:29.834 --> 33:31.166
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
DIDN'T KEEP DITCHING ME

33:31.166 --> 33:31.875
TO GO MAKE OUT
WITH WOMEN--

33:31.875 --> 33:34.542
I WAS JUST PLAYING
BY THE RULES.

33:34.542 --> 33:36.917
BESIDES,
JOEY WAS BEING
VERY...ADAMANT.

33:36.917 --> 33:38.125
WHAT EXACTLY
DID SHE TELL YOU?

33:38.125 --> 33:39.291
NOTHING, REALLY,

33:39.291 --> 33:41.125
BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOUR WORK SOMETIME.

33:44.667 --> 33:45.667
(LAUGHS)

33:45.667 --> 33:47.834
OOH, NO, I DON'T--

33:47.834 --> 33:49.875
I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK SO.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.125
AHEM.

33:51.125 --> 33:53.125
BUT I AM SORRY
FOR BEING,

33:53.125 --> 33:55.500
UH, DISTRACTED
TONIGHT.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.041
IT'S JUST THAT,
YOU KNOW,

33:56.041 --> 33:58.250
THIS WHOLE...
GUS BOMB

33:58.250 --> 34:00.708
THAT, UH, EMMA
DROPPED IS JUST
KINDA SHOCKING.

34:00.708 --> 34:02.417
YEAH,
BUT CRISIS AVERTED.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.583
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.333
WELL, I'M JUST WORRIED.

34:06.333 --> 34:08.458
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I JUST--I HAD NO IDEA

34:08.458 --> 34:09.750
THAT THINGS WERE
SO DESPERATE FOR HER.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.875
WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO NOW?

34:11.875 --> 34:13.291
HMM.
IT'S A BAD SITUATION,

34:13.291 --> 34:18.333
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T
EXACTLY YOUR PROBLEM TO SOLVE.

34:18.333 --> 34:19.208
I MEAN, THERE ISN'T
REALLY MUCH YOU CAN DO

34:19.208 --> 34:20.500
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO GO MARRY HER YOURSELF.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.583
(CHUCKLES)

34:35.667 --> 34:36.542
WAIT.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU GETTING DRESSED?

34:38.667 --> 34:40.875
WELL, YEAH.
I THINK SOME PEOPLE
WANNA GET IN HERE.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.875
DON'T.
MAKE THEM WAIT.

34:43.875 --> 34:45.250
THEIR COATS
AREN'T THAT NICE ANYWAY.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.208
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
ROLLIN' AROUND IN 'EM.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.208
I KNOW. EXACTLY.

34:48.208 --> 34:48.333
OK.
COME HERE.

34:59.250 --> 35:00.875
MMM.

35:00.875 --> 35:04.041
THIS SURE BEATS ARGUING
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
I'VE HAD A DRINK.

35:04.041 --> 35:07.417
NO, THAT WAS FUN
FOR A WHILE, TOO.

35:07.417 --> 35:10.125
WELL, YOU WEREN'T
ENTIRELY WRONG.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.583
YEAH, WELL, I WASN'T
ENTIRELY RIGHT, EITHER.

35:11.583 --> 35:13.375
I MEAN...

35:15.542 --> 35:17.834
IT'S YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH IT.

35:17.834 --> 35:18.375
NOT REALLY.

35:20.625 --> 35:22.291
BUT THIS IS PRETTY NICE
RIGHT HERE.

35:24.834 --> 35:27.458
I GOT
NERVOUS TONIGHT...

35:27.458 --> 35:29.542
WHEN I SAW...

35:29.542 --> 35:32.625
PACEY.

35:32.625 --> 35:36.208
REMINDED ME OF
ALL THE--THE DRAMA.

35:36.208 --> 35:38.041
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST--

35:38.041 --> 35:40.959
I GUESS
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY,

35:40.959 --> 35:42.291
TRY TO BE NORMAL.

35:42.291 --> 35:45.291
I WOULD BE UNHAPPY
IF YOU WERE NORMAL.

35:47.542 --> 35:50.041
BESIDES,
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO DO.

35:50.041 --> 35:51.667
I HAD THIS PLAN

35:51.667 --> 35:55.166
THAT I WAS
NOT GOING TO HAVE
A DRINK TONIGHT,

35:55.166 --> 35:58.959
AND YOU AND I WERE
JUST GOING TO TALK

35:58.959 --> 36:01.792
ABOUT PHILOSOPHY.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.333
THAT'S NOT NORMAL
PARTY BEHAVIOR.

36:05.291 --> 36:09.125
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANY OF THAT STUFF ANYMORE.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.000
I MEAN, I JUST
WANNA...DO THIS.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.792
CAN--CAN WE DO THIS?

36:14.792 --> 36:16.041
THIS?

36:16.041 --> 36:17.333
THINK WE JUST DID,

36:17.333 --> 36:19.458
AND I THINK
SOME COAT OWNERS

36:19.458 --> 36:22.000
AREN'T GONNA
BE TOO HAPPY
WITH THE RESULT.

36:23.792 --> 36:27.333
SERIOUSLY, I--

36:27.333 --> 36:30.333
I DON'T WANNA
DATE THE IDEA OF YOU,

36:30.333 --> 36:31.667
AND I DON'T WANT YOU

36:31.667 --> 36:36.041
TO FALL FOR
SOME FALSE IDEA OF ME.

36:36.041 --> 36:38.792
YOU TRIED FAKING ME OUT
BEFORE, REMEMBER?

36:38.792 --> 36:40.458
YOU'RE NOT
VERY GOOD AT IT.

36:40.458 --> 36:43.458
I KNOW.

36:43.458 --> 36:45.166
WE SHOULD
GET OUTTA HERE.

36:47.375 --> 36:50.250
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SURRENDER THIS COAT
FIRST, YOU KNOW THAT?

36:53.500 --> 36:56.000
NO, THIS IS JOEY'S COAT.
SHE HAS ENOUGH COATS.

37:10.792 --> 37:11.542
COME ON,
LET'S GO GET WASTED.

37:11.542 --> 37:13.708
MMM.

37:13.708 --> 37:15.458
TOTALLY, DUDE.

37:15.917 --> 37:18.250
BYE.
SEE YA, GUYS.

37:18.250 --> 37:22.875
SO, WHERE DO YOU THINK
C.J. AND JEN CAME FROM?

37:22.875 --> 37:24.375
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.834
LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR, UM...

37:26.834 --> 37:27.917
FAILED MARRIAGE
AND EVERYTHING.

37:27.917 --> 37:29.375
YEAH, THANKS, JACK,

37:29.375 --> 37:32.500
THE SYMPATHY IS JUST
OOZING FROM YOUR VOICE.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.750
ALL RIGHT, WELL, BETWEEN
A LOVELESS MARRIAGE

37:34.750 --> 37:35.917
AND--AND GOING HOME,

37:35.917 --> 37:36.875
DON'T YOU THINK
GOING HOME WOULD BE
A LITTLE BIT BETTER?

37:36.875 --> 37:39.083
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
AT LEAST YOU'D
HAVE SOME TIME

37:39.083 --> 37:39.917
TO FIGURE
SOME THINGS OUT.

37:39.917 --> 37:41.125
MY FOLKS ARE GREAT,
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

37:41.125 --> 37:42.875
BUT IT IS
MY MOM'S DYING WISH

37:42.875 --> 37:45.583
TO SEE ME FAIL AT THIS,

37:45.583 --> 37:46.959
AND I JUST CAN'T
GIVE HER THAT SATISFACTION.

37:46.959 --> 37:48.375
YOU KNOW, I'D BE THERE
ONE DAY,

37:48.375 --> 37:49.834
SHE'D HAVE ME
TUTORING THE SLOW KIDS

37:49.834 --> 37:52.583
ON THE TRIANGLE.
IT'S MUSICAL SUICIDE.

37:52.583 --> 37:54.500
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR LOVE RIGHT NOW.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.500
WHEN I FIND IT,
IT USUALLY KICKS MY ASS.

37:56.500 --> 37:57.500
(CHUCKLES)

37:57.500 --> 38:00.250
AND IF AT SOME POINT
SOME CHRISTIAN BALE TYPE

38:00.250 --> 38:03.667
DOES DESCEND UPON ME,
SO TO SPEAK...

38:03.667 --> 38:04.959
I'LL JUST, UM...
YEAH.

38:04.959 --> 38:07.750
DUMP THE POOR SAP
I MARRIED.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.417
HMM. WELL,

38:09.417 --> 38:12.291
I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF PRIVATE
TIME WITH THAT, UH,

38:12.291 --> 38:14.458
CHRISTIAN BALE TYPE
BEFORE I CAN LET YOU
MARRY HIM.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.500
(LAUGHS)
UH-UH.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.041
YOU ACTUALLY, I--I...

38:18.041 --> 38:20.208
I WOULD BE
THE PERFECT HUSBAND.

38:20.208 --> 38:22.125
YOU KNOW, I CAN HELP YOU
CHECK OUT GUYS,

38:22.125 --> 38:25.959
I CAN...MAKE SURE
THEY'RE NOT GAY.

38:25.959 --> 38:28.000
(LAUGHS)

38:28.000 --> 38:30.750
YES, IT IS RATHER A HASSLE
WHEN YOU FIND THAT OUT
LATE IN THE GAME, ISN'T IT?

38:30.750 --> 38:34.542
PLUS, YOU KNOW,
I WOULDN'T BE PAWING YOU
ALL THE TIME LIKE GUS.

38:34.542 --> 38:38.125
WELL, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
LET'S GET MARRIED, THEN.

38:41.875 --> 38:43.417
LET'S DO IT.

38:49.125 --> 38:51.125
(LAUGHS)

38:51.125 --> 38:53.208
YEAH, UM...

38:53.208 --> 38:55.125
HOW MUCH
HAVE YOU HAD
TO DRINK?

38:55.125 --> 38:56.250
I'M JUST TRYIN'
TO HELP YOU OUT.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.750
I MEAN, WE ALREADY
LIVE TOGETHER, RIGHT?

38:58.750 --> 39:01.291
LOOK, WHY DO YOU
THINK I ASKED GUS?

39:01.291 --> 39:03.291
'CAUSE HE'S A NASTY
LITTLE CREATURE WHO
I DON'T CARE ABOUT.

39:03.291 --> 39:05.166
IT'S EASIER
THAT WAY.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.667
I COULD NEVER ASK
THAT BIG OF A FAVOR
FROM A FRIEND.

39:07.667 --> 39:08.625
I JUST--I COULDN'T.

39:08.625 --> 39:11.917
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO 'CAUSE...

39:11.917 --> 39:16.041
I'M ASKIN' YOU.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.375
JACK,

39:20.375 --> 39:23.125
YOU ARE TOO GOOD.

39:25.875 --> 39:26.875
WELL, NOT REALLY.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.834
I--I--I DIDN'T
GET YOU A RING OR--

39:29.834 --> 39:32.000
THAT'S
A GOOD POINT!

39:32.000 --> 39:34.500
NO, YOU ARE. YOU ARE
TOO GOOD FOR THAT.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.500
I COULDN'T.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.834
(SIGHS)

39:36.834 --> 39:38.500
I WOULD.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.917
I KNOW.

39:39.917 --> 39:41.917
I KNOW YOU WOULD,
YOU MADMAN.

39:42.708 --> 39:45.291
I WISH I COULD TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

39:47.166 --> 39:48.041
NOPE.

39:48.041 --> 39:50.375
I CAN'T RUIN
2 LIVES.

39:50.375 --> 39:51.250
(LAUGHS)

39:51.250 --> 39:54.542
IT'S MY MESS.
I'VE GOT TO FIX IT.

39:54.542 --> 39:56.583
I'VE BEEN
LIVIN' TOO LONG
IN FANTASY LAND.

40:00.583 --> 40:03.166
GO DRY THOSE DISHES.

40:09.959 --> 40:11.750
AND HERE WE ARE.

40:11.750 --> 40:13.875
HOME, SWEET...

40:13.875 --> 40:15.041
ALREADY?

40:15.041 --> 40:19.041
ALREADY. I KNOW,
IT'S A LONG TRIP UP
FROM THE LIVING ROOM.

40:19.041 --> 40:22.041
THAT WAS FUN.

40:22.041 --> 40:24.417
SEE, I'M
A LOVELY DRUNK.

40:24.417 --> 40:26.458
YOU ARE INDEED,
MISS POTTER.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.083
I TALKED TO SO MANY
NEW PEOPLE TONIGHT.

40:28.083 --> 40:31.917
PEOPLE LOVE ME.

40:31.917 --> 40:33.542
AND THEY LOVE IT
WHEN YOU TELL THEM

40:33.542 --> 40:35.708
YOUR FRIENDS'
DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS.

40:35.708 --> 40:37.750
HUH?

40:39.708 --> 40:41.667
NOTHING. NEVER MIND.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.125
IT WAS A WONDERFUL
PARTY, PACEY.

40:46.125 --> 40:49.583
UNTIL ALL
THE SMASHES AND STUFF.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.792
YEAH, THE SMASHING
WAS NOT SO GOOD.

40:51.792 --> 40:54.333
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE TELEVISION THING.

40:54.333 --> 40:56.500
IT'S OK. IT HAPPENS.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.750
AND I PROBABLY
WAS GETTING A LITTLE
TOO ATTACHED.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.125
CAN'T HAVE THAT.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.333
NO.

41:03.333 --> 41:08.208
BUT I'M GLAD
YOU HAD A GOOD TIME.
YOU DESERVED IT.

41:08.208 --> 41:10.625
AND YOU ARE A LOVELY
AND WISE DRUNK,
MISS POTTER.

41:20.500 --> 41:23.083
WHAT YOU SAID
EARLIER WAS RIGHT.

41:23.083 --> 41:25.083
I NEVER DID.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.500
HOW COULD I?

41:29.083 --> 41:32.375
JUST LOOK AT YOU.

41:34.542 --> 41:37.250
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WE NEVER DID?

41:55.166 --> 41:57.125
YOUR TURN NOW.

42:10.250 --> 42:12.625
SWEET DREAMS, JOEY.
