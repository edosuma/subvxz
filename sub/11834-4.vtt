00:00.834 --> 00:02.202
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:02.235 --> 00:04.270
We have one last pretrial

00:04.304 --> 00:05.639
where I'll try
to suppress your statement.

00:05.672 --> 00:08.041
Scott,
if I'm unsuccessful--

00:08.074 --> 00:10.443
No, no, no. No, I'm not
taking manslaughter, Bobby.

00:10.476 --> 00:13.547
Please don't
ask me that again!

00:13.580 --> 00:16.783
-He's going to walk?
-I'm not saying that, but--

00:16.817 --> 00:19.586
But what? He killed my sister.
Don't tell me now that--

00:19.620 --> 00:22.155
Mr. Barrett, as we have
explained from the start,

00:22.188 --> 00:24.324
our case is
hugely circumstantial.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.159
You knew your sister, sir.

00:26.192 --> 00:29.195
There is no way she would
ever take her own life,

00:29.229 --> 00:31.231
not in any circumstance.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.799
She was murdered.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.068
If you know it--
She did not commit suicide--

00:35.101 --> 00:37.838
You absolutely know it.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.339
She said that if she
turned up missing,

00:39.372 --> 00:41.107
that I should
call the police

00:41.141 --> 00:43.276
because Scott probably
did something to her.

00:43.309 --> 00:44.545
BOBBY: Objection!

00:44.578 --> 00:46.547
You want me
to sign this--

00:46.580 --> 00:48.348
An affidavit saying
I coached a witness to lie?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.450
He made that stuff up about
his sister being afraid.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.619
Helen, I told him

00:52.653 --> 00:54.621
what his testimony
needed to accomplish.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.523
I never said lie.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.525
I'm convinced that Kyle Barrett
lied on the stand

00:58.559 --> 01:02.228
after being coached
by the prosecution.

01:02.262 --> 01:03.864
I don't think Mr. Bay
crossed the line.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.100
I see no evidence
that he solicited perjury.

01:07.133 --> 01:10.236
The conviction therefore stands.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.638
I'll get a new trial, right?

01:11.672 --> 01:13.740
I mean, the judge made
all of those mistakes.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.609
Am I going to get a new trial?

01:15.642 --> 01:17.443
That's what we're hoping for.

01:17.477 --> 01:18.712
I thought I was okay,

01:18.745 --> 01:21.648
but I'm feeling
maybe I'm not.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.283
Just hurry.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.423
Two years? That's it?

01:30.456 --> 01:32.458
Yes.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.763
It's a decent plea for us.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.431
If he gets convicted,

01:38.464 --> 01:41.467
the most he'd serve
is probably three.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.737
But I could've died, Helen.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.806
I understand,
but like you said,

01:45.839 --> 01:47.674
you didn't think he was
really trying to kill you.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.810
But he tried to hurt me.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.378
Which is why
he's about to go on trial.

01:52.412 --> 01:56.517
I'll get him, Margaret,
but if we can get the plea...

01:56.550 --> 01:58.218
you don't want
to be put through this.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.720
I know your husband's lawyers.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.756
They're tough.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.458
Three years.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.163
I am not pleading guilty.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.799
Look, this is your wife

02:12.833 --> 02:15.368
saying you pushed her
down a flight of stairs.

02:15.401 --> 02:17.504
-I didn't touch her.
-The problem is

02:17.538 --> 02:19.906
victims of domestic violence
can look very sympathetic--

02:19.940 --> 02:22.543
-She is not a victim.
-Well, they'll make her
look like one,

02:22.576 --> 02:24.477
and the jury is going
to want to know--

02:24.511 --> 02:26.246
Why would she
lie about this?

02:26.279 --> 02:27.514
I would like to know myself.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.716
-Robert--
-What about my daughter?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.518
If I plead guilty
to a crime like this,

02:31.552 --> 02:32.886
then I'll lose custody of her.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.521
No, that isn't
necessarily true.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.957
-You could get custody--
-No, I didn't do it.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.626
I didn't throw my wife
down a flight of stairs,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.427
and I won't
say that I did.

02:41.461 --> 02:44.364
I don't care
what my odds are. No.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.235
♪ (theme)

03:41.955 --> 03:44.490
Can I have your attention,
everybody?

03:44.525 --> 03:47.628
I have very exciting news.
Now, it's kind of private,

03:47.661 --> 03:50.531
but, um, I've been keeping it in
for, like, two months now,

03:50.564 --> 03:51.998
and I can't anymore.
I'm sorry.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.367
What?

03:54.400 --> 03:57.604
Well, two months ago--
Now, keep in mind

03:57.638 --> 03:59.840
it is so not like me
to go through waste cans,

03:59.873 --> 04:03.610
but it was a dull day,
and I was in the ladies' room.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.279
Anyways, I found
this pregnancy test thing,

04:06.312 --> 04:08.448
and it was positive.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.450
Now, I know it could've been
anybody on this floor,

04:10.483 --> 04:12.452
but I still had a feeling.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.689
Then yesterday a book came,
and I opened it, you know,

04:15.722 --> 04:17.322
thinking it was just
office supplies--

04:17.357 --> 04:19.325
Books--
Usually library things.

04:19.358 --> 04:20.994
Unfortunately, I threw away
who it was addressed to,

04:21.027 --> 04:22.596
and then the trash guy came
and picked it up,

04:22.629 --> 04:24.330
and-- Well, whatever.

04:29.335 --> 04:32.773
Somebody here is pregos.
Lindsay?

04:32.806 --> 04:35.609
-I didn't order that thing.
-Oh, come on.

04:35.642 --> 04:36.777
I thought I saw a tummy.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.444
I did not order that thing.

04:38.478 --> 04:42.415
Lindsay,
we might as well tell them.

04:44.918 --> 04:48.855
-That's great!
-Thank you, Lucy,
for your exciting news.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.557
Well, I couldn't keep it
from the family.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.693
-How far along?
-Four months.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.761
-Who's the father?
-You're funny today.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.898
Congratulations.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.638
MARGARET: Help, police!

05:04.671 --> 05:06.873
MAN: Where you at,
ma'am? Ma'am?

05:06.907 --> 05:09.643
MAERGARET: 830 Brayson.
You have to hurry!

05:09.676 --> 05:10.744
MAN: Okay, okay, stay
on the line.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.012
Just tell me what's happening.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.547
ROBERT:
What are you doing?

05:13.580 --> 05:15.549
MARGARET:
My husband-- 830--

05:15.582 --> 05:16.983
ROBERT:
What the hell are you doing?
Margaret!

05:17.017 --> 05:18.018
Robert, stop! You're--

05:18.051 --> 05:19.553
(static on line)

05:19.586 --> 05:21.822
MAN:
Ma'am, are you there?

05:21.855 --> 05:24.424
Can you get back
on the phone, ma'am? Hello?

05:24.457 --> 05:26.560
What's happening, ma'am?
Hello?

05:26.593 --> 05:28.895
(tape shuts off)

05:28.929 --> 05:32.132
830 Brayson. Are you familiar
with that address?

05:32.165 --> 05:35.502
Yes. After getting
the radio run, I responded
to that location.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.572
-And what did you find?
-The front door was open.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.574
When we got inside,
we found the defendant

05:40.607 --> 05:42.709
at the base of a stairwell
in the foyer area.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.745
Mrs. Wakefield was lying
face up, wearing a nightgown,

05:44.778 --> 05:46.580
and she appeared
to be unconscious.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.582
The defendant
was sitting next to her

05:48.615 --> 05:50.050
holding her head
from behind.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.452
Was there anybody else
in the house?

05:52.485 --> 05:54.387
The defendant's
9-year-old daughter.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.623
She said she was in her room
and didn't see anything.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.391
Could you describe
the defendant's demeanor

05:58.424 --> 05:59.926
when you spoke to him?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.728
He was very upset.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.064
Right away I could
smell alcohol on his breath,

06:04.097 --> 06:07.133
and his eyes,
they were very glassy.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.869
What did you do next?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.537
I called
for an ambulance,

06:10.571 --> 06:11.805
and we took Mrs. Wakefield
to Mass General.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.406
Could you describe
her condition?

06:13.439 --> 06:15.141
At first
she was still unconscious,

06:15.175 --> 06:17.811
but on the way there
she started to come to.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.914
That's when she told me that
her husband had pushed her.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.016
Just to be clear, Officer,

06:23.049 --> 06:26.620
could you describe
Mrs. Wakefield's exact words?

06:26.653 --> 06:31.157
"He pushed me.
Robert pushed me."

06:34.227 --> 06:36.663
-You said my client was upset?
-Yes.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.532
-He wasn't violent?
-No.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.502
And when you got there,
you saw him sitting
with his wife

06:41.535 --> 06:43.637
holding her head
in his hands?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.639
Yes.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.641
So you cannot exclude
the possibility

06:47.674 --> 06:49.976
that Mrs. Wakefield tripped
on her own nightgown?

06:50.010 --> 06:52.913
Can I positively exclude it?
No, but--

06:52.946 --> 06:57.050
Thank you, Officer.
When Mrs. Wakefield
was taken to the hospital,

06:57.083 --> 06:58.451
my client went with her,
right?

06:58.484 --> 07:00.587
He met us there, yeah.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.923
And did you permit Mr. Wakefield
to visit his own wife?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.725
At that point we didn't
even know what we had.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.760
Really?

07:06.793 --> 07:09.930
So even after Mrs. Wakefield's
big statement in the ambulance,

07:09.963 --> 07:12.198
you still weren't sure
a crime had been committed.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.034
We were investigating.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.869
You weren't sure
about what she told you?

07:15.902 --> 07:17.604
We had no reason
to doubt her.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.806
But the man she accused
of pushing her--

07:19.840 --> 07:22.676
You allowed him to visit her,
didn't you?

07:22.709 --> 07:25.111
Yes.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.656
What do you mean "spots"?

07:35.689 --> 07:37.924
I mean "spots."

07:37.958 --> 07:40.961
It's worse when I look
at the light, but, uh,

07:40.994 --> 07:44.531
even when I don't,
I still see spots,

07:44.565 --> 07:46.132
and they're big,
and then they shrink,

07:46.166 --> 07:48.969
and then, uh, when I blink
they, uh, come back.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.504
Not always,
but, I mean, sometimes.

07:50.537 --> 07:51.838
Sometimes I see them.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.976
And you said they had
the optometrist examine them?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.044
He's a hack. I mean,
how many kids do you know

07:58.078 --> 08:00.981
went to med school so that
they could examine prisoners?

08:01.014 --> 08:03.283
I mean,
the doctors in this place

08:03.316 --> 08:05.218
are all unemployable hacks.

08:05.251 --> 08:09.055
Is it fun?

08:10.757 --> 08:14.027
Is what fun?

08:14.060 --> 08:16.997
Well, I would think
it would be fun, you know?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.799
You must dream
about big cases,

08:18.832 --> 08:21.167
and this one-- a murder,
your friend on the hook.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.637
I mean,
I would think that this

08:23.670 --> 08:25.872
has all the stakes that
any lawyer could ever wish for,

08:25.906 --> 08:27.808
and if you're not
having fun now, Bobby,

08:27.841 --> 08:31.277
I mean, then what's
the point, you know?

08:31.311 --> 08:35.716
Scott, we're going to have you
meet with a psychiatrist.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.650
I was convicted,
for God's sake.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.186
What, you want to have me
declared incompetent

08:40.220 --> 08:44.057
to stand appeal?
Oh, I mean, that's smart.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.860
Why don't you examine my eyes
while you're at it?

08:46.893 --> 08:48.328
Do I get to go?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.096
Go where?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.303
He's losing it.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.140
We got to get him
the hell out of here.

09:09.082 --> 09:12.085
Margaret.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.123
What's wrong?

09:17.157 --> 09:20.861
I don't think Robert

09:20.894 --> 09:24.665
intended to push me
down the stairs.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.200
I beg your pardon?

09:27.233 --> 09:30.336
No, I've been replaying this
over and over again.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.172
Have you been talking to him?

09:34.641 --> 09:37.143
We have thought
of reconciling,

09:37.177 --> 09:40.146
but this is the truth--

09:40.180 --> 09:42.616
I made a mistake.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.919
Margaret,
don't you dare do this.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.353
Helen, at the time,

09:47.387 --> 09:49.355
I didn't know what to think.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.357
Uh, one minute we're fighting.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.326
The next--
I wake up in a hospital,

09:53.359 --> 09:55.261
police officers
asking me questions.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.798
I was angry.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.901
I think I convinced myself,
at the time,

10:00.934 --> 10:03.369
that he did it on purpose,

10:03.403 --> 10:06.172
but he didn't...

10:06.206 --> 10:10.944
and I'm dropping
the charges.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.378
First of all,

10:12.412 --> 10:15.115
you don't get to drop
the charges.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.217
Only the district attorney
can do that.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.252
But it's my choice
whether to continue.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.054
Actually, no, it's not.

10:21.087 --> 10:24.791
You chose to call 911.
Now I make those decisions.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.661
I'm not testifying, Helen.

10:27.694 --> 10:30.764
Then I'll get
a material witness order
and have you arrested.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.735
If you try to force me,
I'll tell the jury I fell.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.069
This was an accident.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.138
Oh, Margaret,

10:38.171 --> 10:40.140
I know you think you have
no life without this man,

10:40.173 --> 10:45.278
-but trust me--
-I'm not some weak victim here.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.147
Look...

10:49.716 --> 10:54.420
We've had a complicated,
volatile relationship.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.423
If you want to prosecute me

10:57.457 --> 11:01.427
for false arrest or whatever,

11:01.461 --> 11:04.164
I'll own that,

11:04.197 --> 11:06.967
but the man didn't push me
down the stairs.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.450
What happened?

11:24.484 --> 11:27.821
My victim just recanted.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.890
That's why I prefer murders--

11:29.923 --> 11:31.224
When they're dead,

11:31.257 --> 11:32.959
they can't change
their stories.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.097
What do you want?

11:39.132 --> 11:41.467
I came to apologize.

11:41.502 --> 11:44.771
I have been a little
influenced

11:44.805 --> 11:47.508
by politics of late.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.976
You were there for me
when my job was in peril,

11:50.010 --> 11:55.281
and I want you to know
I'm here for you now.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.383
Is my job in peril?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.419
Helen, they've stuck you
with domestic violence.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.187
What does that tell you?

12:01.221 --> 12:04.057
They? "They" being
Kate Brunner.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.327
Well, that's--
She carries a lot of power.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.298
I'm told you're supplying
Bobby Donnell

12:12.332 --> 12:14.367
with an affidavit.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.102
Not that
you suborned perjury,

12:16.136 --> 12:18.104
only that I thought
the witness was coached

12:18.138 --> 12:20.073
and that he committed
perjury.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.408
If I can give you
a little advice,

12:22.442 --> 12:24.511
I wouldn't give him
that statement.

12:24.545 --> 12:26.813
Is that why you're here,
Richard,

12:26.847 --> 12:30.283
to reach out
and gag a friend?

12:30.316 --> 12:32.018
It really doesn't affect me.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.820
It does your case

12:33.854 --> 12:35.488
and, therefore,
you with Kate Brunner.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.158
You win, she likes you.
You lose, she doesn't.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.862
And if I lose, you will get
the brunt of the blame,

12:41.895 --> 12:43.463
not me.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.332
I already gave Bobby
the affidavit.

12:46.366 --> 12:50.403
But thanks
for stopping by, Richard.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.507
It's been good
to catch up.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.052
You working late?

13:06.086 --> 13:09.523
The Wallace appeal
is tomorrow.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.892
You feeling okay?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.159
Fine.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.229
I'm glad it's out.

13:16.262 --> 13:20.466
It was hard for me
to keep it a secret.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.404
Bobby, I didn't take
the pregnancy test here.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.573
Did you order that book?

13:26.607 --> 13:28.809
Me? No.

13:30.877 --> 13:34.047
That little witch tricked us.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.083
Either that,
or somebody else is pregnant.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.056
You okay, Bec?

13:43.089 --> 13:46.359
Hmm? Oh, sure.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.028
What you thinking about?

13:48.061 --> 13:50.931
Just the case.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.398
MARGARET: Ms. Washington?

13:55.401 --> 13:57.103
Can I speak to you?

13:57.137 --> 13:59.205
Well, I represent your husband.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.242
Yes, I know.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.111
I've decided not to testify.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.914
Oh.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.317
Well.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.154
Actually, I do want to testify,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.122
but for Robert.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.424
I'm not sure I understand.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.493
Your client is innocent.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.919
You got a problem.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.154
He's about two weeks
away from Bridgewater.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.456
He's suffering from
severe clinical depression.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.392
He needs to be hospitalized
right now.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.227
We're due in court.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.197
Bobby, this man
is not going to court.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.532
He's in the middle
of what's called

14:58.565 --> 15:00.567
a situational
mental breakdown,

15:00.601 --> 15:04.270
most likely caused by
twin positional traumas--

15:04.304 --> 15:06.172
The death of his wife,
and the conviction.

15:06.206 --> 15:09.309
The spots,
the inability to sleep--

15:09.342 --> 15:12.012
The man is on the verge
of a psychotic breakdown.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.681
He needs to be transferred
to a mental facility right now.

15:14.715 --> 15:16.482
Eugene, go to Wolf.

15:16.517 --> 15:18.151
File a motion
that he be transferred

15:18.184 --> 15:20.086
to the hospital jail ward.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.188
I'll handle
the appeals court myself.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.590
I'll need your affidavit.

15:23.624 --> 15:25.526
Can you agree
to supervise at the hospital?

15:25.559 --> 15:27.127
Absolutely.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.295
You've got to get him
out of prison.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.098
Let's go.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.040
He had me by the shoulders.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.375
I can remember his face

15:42.408 --> 15:45.111
being right there
in front of me.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.080
I had never heard him
scream like that.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.414
What were you fighting about?

15:48.448 --> 15:49.750
The same thing as always--

15:49.783 --> 15:51.484
He wouldn't stop drinking.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.521
It was getting worse
since the wedding.

15:54.555 --> 15:56.289
Did you tell him
you were worried?

15:56.322 --> 15:57.558
I tried,

15:57.591 --> 15:59.292
but when Robert's like that...

15:59.325 --> 16:00.994
you can't tell him anything.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.295
What was he saying?

16:02.328 --> 16:03.630
It was my fault.

16:03.664 --> 16:05.131
He had to drink

16:05.165 --> 16:07.634
because I was
making him miserable.

16:07.668 --> 16:10.303
He was yelling
and shaking me.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.139
That's when I got scared.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.075
I waited till he left the room,

16:15.108 --> 16:16.677
and called 911.

16:16.710 --> 16:19.479
Tell the jury
why you called the police.

16:19.513 --> 16:22.182
I never wanted
to have him arrested.

16:22.215 --> 16:25.185
I thought they could just
get him out of the house--

16:25.218 --> 16:28.689
Hold him, maybe,
until he was sober again.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.457
But then he heard you
on the phone?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.793
He came up behind me

16:32.826 --> 16:34.695
and ripped the phone
out of my hand.

16:34.728 --> 16:37.598
That's why I was screaming
on the tape.

16:37.631 --> 16:39.700
I was scared,
so I ran.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.202
When I got to the stairs,
I was going too fast.

16:42.235 --> 16:46.540
All I remember is falling
and waking up at the hospital.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.142
Mrs. Wakefield,
I want to be clear.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.646
Did Robert push you
down those stairs?

16:52.679 --> 16:58.051
No. We were fighting,
but he didn't hurt me.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.220
I tripped, and I fell.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.488
But that's not
what you told the police.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.457
I was angry.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.358
They were trying to get me
to say what they wanted,

17:06.392 --> 17:09.395
and I wanted to punish him.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.066
"We were at the top
of the staircase.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.068
"Robert had me by the hair.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.368
"I begged him to let me go,

17:16.402 --> 17:18.471
and then he pushed me
from behind."

17:18.505 --> 17:20.473
Isn't that what you said
in the hospital?

17:20.507 --> 17:23.577
I didn't really have time
to think about things.

17:23.609 --> 17:26.747
Have you and your husband
talked about reconciling?

17:26.780 --> 17:28.281
Yes.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.618
When did you have these talks?

17:31.652 --> 17:33.620
A few days ago.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.231
Look at your face, Margaret.

17:51.404 --> 17:56.610
Look, I'm not saying that I
didn't fall down the stairs.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.479
I'm not saying
that it didn't happen

17:59.513 --> 18:02.182
as a result of an argument
and scuffle with Robert.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.817
What I am finally admitting--

18:03.850 --> 18:06.186
-You've answered my question.
-No, I haven't.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.521
I ask that the witness
be instructed--

18:07.554 --> 18:08.689
You are trying to make it seem

18:08.722 --> 18:10.423
like he's controlling me!

18:10.456 --> 18:12.759
The witness may answer
the question.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.232
What I am finally admitting to

18:19.265 --> 18:22.235
is that he didn't intend
for me to fall.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.871
I know that disturbs your case,

18:24.905 --> 18:28.542
but, like it or not...

18:28.575 --> 18:29.876
it's the truth.

18:33.914 --> 18:36.382
I would like to focus
the court's attention

18:36.416 --> 18:38.351
on our first issue
for appeal,

18:38.384 --> 18:40.554
which is
the trial court's refusal

18:40.587 --> 18:42.388
to conduct
an evidentiary hearing

18:42.422 --> 18:43.924
concerning
the charge of perjury

18:43.957 --> 18:46.392
by a material witness,

18:46.426 --> 18:48.228
and the prosecution's role
in suborning that perjury.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.763
Attached to our
supplemental brief

18:49.796 --> 18:51.264
is the sworn affidavit

18:51.297 --> 18:53.900
of district attorney
Helen Gamble,

18:53.934 --> 18:55.401
who was present when Mr. Bay
encouraged the witness,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.571
Kyle Barrett,
to give false testimony.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.405
That's not what
her affidavit says.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.274
It alleges he coached
the witness,

19:01.307 --> 19:03.677
but doesn't go so far as
to state he suborned perjury.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.411
It says he supplied testimony
which was new

19:05.445 --> 19:07.447
and different
from any prior statement

19:07.480 --> 19:08.749
given by this witness.

19:08.782 --> 19:10.751
That to me implies perjury,

19:10.784 --> 19:12.753
and a reading
of Ms. Gamble's affidavit

19:12.786 --> 19:14.454
reveals that she too
drew that inference.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.524
Mr. Bay, I assume you take issue
with this allegation?

19:17.558 --> 19:19.292
I'm offended by it.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.294
I certainly expressed
to the witness

19:21.327 --> 19:23.463
the need for his testimony
to be compelling.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.398
I never remotely
asked him to lie.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.868
What about the idea that
you supplied the testimony?

19:27.901 --> 19:30.303
I gave him a list of points
we needed to cover.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.206
I told him what
was most relevant,
what needed to be emphasized.

19:33.239 --> 19:36.943
The idea that I encouraged
false testimony is preposterous!

19:36.977 --> 19:39.312
It's a desperate ploy
by a defense team

19:39.345 --> 19:41.314
that's even arguing
its own inadequacy,

19:41.347 --> 19:42.516
if you look
at paragraph six.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.250
I haven't got to that yet!

19:44.284 --> 19:46.853
Your Honors,
this is the catchall

19:46.887 --> 19:48.522
"inadequacy of counsel" appeal

19:48.555 --> 19:49.823
that's typically
thrown out there

19:49.856 --> 19:51.592
when the defendants have
little else to go on.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.560
The fact remains,

19:53.594 --> 19:55.596
Scott Wallace
is an educated man.

19:55.629 --> 19:58.532
He participated
in his defense fully.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.301
This was a strategic decision
to which he relented.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.404
It does not rise to a denial
of his right to testify.

20:06.807 --> 20:09.510
-It's unfair surprise.
-I didn't know about it myself.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.411
-I just uncovered it.
-That doesn't matter.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.813
At this point in the trial--

20:12.846 --> 20:14.615
Look, I'll give you time
if you want discovery.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.550
-I don't want time.
-Hold on.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.318
These are records
of her injuries?

20:18.351 --> 20:20.253
No, Your Honor,
his previous wife.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.588
There are also medical records

20:21.622 --> 20:23.456
of three injuries
to the daughter.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.292
A broken arm,
a shoulder bruise,
and a laceration.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.629
-Over a period of...
-Eleven years total.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.496
First of all,
there is no evidence

20:30.531 --> 20:32.833
or suggestion that my client
caused these injuries.

20:32.866 --> 20:35.836
Was Mr. Wakefield ever accused
of any abuse?

20:35.869 --> 20:39.339
No, but with this pattern,
he probably should have been.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.642
Do you have any evidence
that he caused them?

20:41.675 --> 20:43.744
No, but--

20:43.777 --> 20:45.478
Denied.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.480
-You know better than that.
-Your Honor...

20:47.514 --> 20:50.817
Out you go.
I'll see you back in court.

20:54.855 --> 20:56.923
(door opens)

20:59.626 --> 21:01.061
Did you hit your first wife?

21:01.094 --> 21:02.796
What?

21:02.829 --> 21:04.330
They dug up hospital reports,

21:04.364 --> 21:05.666
and some on Jennifer, too.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.934
No. They're saying
that I hit them?

21:07.968 --> 21:09.970
Well, luckily,
they don't get to say it,

21:10.003 --> 21:12.506
but my question is,
did you?

21:12.539 --> 21:14.474
Of course not!
Rebecca!

21:14.508 --> 21:15.676
How'd she get her injuries?

21:15.709 --> 21:17.443
What injuries?

21:17.477 --> 21:18.579
Bruises. Cuts.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.313
Jennifer had a broken arm.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.616
She fell off of her bike.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.818
Joanne, she rode horses.
She jumped.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.853
She had a couple
of accidents, maybe.

21:26.887 --> 21:28.789
What the hell is this?

21:28.822 --> 21:30.456
Is this what happens now--

21:30.490 --> 21:32.292
They start manufacturing things?

21:34.494 --> 21:36.530
Seems like a lot
of accidents, Robert.

21:36.563 --> 21:39.099
Hey, I've had my share
of yelling arguments.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.767
I've even grabbed
from time to time,

21:40.801 --> 21:42.569
both Joanne and Margaret,

21:42.603 --> 21:45.572
but I have never,
ever hit a woman.

21:45.606 --> 21:48.308
And my daughter!

21:50.511 --> 21:53.647
I don't think it's wise
for you to testify.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.016
I suggest we rest
and go to closing.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.684
And why is that?

21:57.718 --> 21:58.919
Because Helen Gamble
could back-door

21:58.952 --> 22:00.353
that other stuff on impeachment,

22:00.386 --> 22:01.622
and it wouldn't look good.

22:01.655 --> 22:03.356
Trust me.

22:05.559 --> 22:08.529
Do I need another lawyer here?

22:11.131 --> 22:12.899
I'll finish.

22:12.933 --> 22:16.002
I don't want you finishing
unless you believe me.

22:16.036 --> 22:18.705
Do I need a new lawyer?

22:22.576 --> 22:24.377
I'll finish.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.660
I'm telling you, Ellenor,

22:39.693 --> 22:41.595
I know this woman.

22:41.628 --> 22:45.431
She's covering for him.
I know her.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.601
At the risk of getting
my head bitten off,

22:47.634 --> 22:49.069
ground into wheat germ,

22:49.102 --> 22:50.504
and sprinkled
on your cereal,

22:50.537 --> 22:52.005
I know you.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.774
What's that supposed to mean?

22:53.807 --> 22:56.076
It means you are under
a lot of pressure at work.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.978
Have you considered
the possibility

22:58.011 --> 22:59.980
that you need
this conviction so badly

23:00.013 --> 23:01.982
you are willing
to chase one

23:02.015 --> 23:03.784
even in the absence
of a crime?

23:03.817 --> 23:05.652
Look, after what I did
on the Wallace case,

23:05.686 --> 23:07.688
how could you
even say that to me?

23:07.721 --> 23:09.790
I believe you believe
he's guilty.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.993
My question is,
do you need to believe it?

23:13.026 --> 23:15.996
The only eyewitness
is the victim,

23:16.029 --> 23:18.932
and she says
there was no crime.

23:18.965 --> 23:22.168
Is she the only eyewitness?

23:26.873 --> 23:29.910
(school bell rings)

23:41.555 --> 23:43.524
Jennifer?

23:43.557 --> 23:45.458
Hi.

23:45.491 --> 23:47.493
Are you Jennifer Wakefield?

23:47.528 --> 23:48.695
Who are you?

23:48.729 --> 23:50.130
My name's Helen Gamble.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.032
I'm a district attorney.

23:52.065 --> 23:54.735
Could I talk to you
for a second?

23:56.603 --> 23:58.939
I know who you are.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.577
(telephone rings)

24:03.610 --> 24:05.712
Donnell-- Whatever.

24:05.746 --> 24:08.582
Yeah. Yeah, he's right here.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.818
It's the clerk's office
about the Wallace appeal.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.755
Hello.

24:16.590 --> 24:17.924
Yes.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.027
Today?

24:22.596 --> 24:24.097
Thank you.

24:25.566 --> 24:27.100
What?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.902
They ordered a full hearing

24:28.935 --> 24:30.871
on the perjury issue.

24:30.904 --> 24:33.907
We go back
into Judge Wolf today.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.809
That's our best grounds,
Eugene.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.511
We have a shot.

24:37.544 --> 24:38.879
-I don't believe it.
-We're back in this.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.914
Well, let's not
get carried away.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.916
Eugene, it's our best grounds.
We're gonna get him out.

24:42.949 --> 24:46.687
Bobby, we can't get
Scott's hopes up.

24:46.720 --> 24:47.788
Not yet.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.292
They turned us down
on three issues.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.927
But on the perjury,

24:53.960 --> 24:57.163
-we get a full hearing.
-And this is good?

24:57.197 --> 24:59.099
Well, we were hoping
they'd order a new
trial outright.

24:59.132 --> 25:01.034
We didn't get that,
but with a hearing,

25:01.067 --> 25:04.104
if the judge determines
that the brother did
commit perjury,

25:04.137 --> 25:06.673
then we get a new trial.

25:06.707 --> 25:08.742
Unfortunately, we go before
the same judge we had at trial.

25:08.775 --> 25:09.810
Wolf?

25:09.843 --> 25:10.944
Yes, but...

25:10.977 --> 25:12.746
I said no toast!

25:12.779 --> 25:14.615
No toast.

25:26.927 --> 25:29.996
Scott, you need to rest.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.301
The doctor says
that you're suffering
from clinical depression.

25:35.335 --> 25:37.638
Karen dying, the conviction...

25:39.139 --> 25:41.808
You need to rest,
take your medication,

25:41.842 --> 25:44.077
and we'll do
what we need to do.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.012
The spots are going away.

25:46.046 --> 25:49.550
I'm doing better, Bobby.
I'm not seeing the spots.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.119
This is great.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.990
You'll, uh...

25:57.023 --> 26:00.193
You'll come back and see me
after the hearing?

26:02.228 --> 26:03.564
I promise.

26:05.198 --> 26:06.933
-I promise.
-Thank you.

26:16.276 --> 26:20.013
She is a witness!
I have a right to question
any witness!

26:20.046 --> 26:22.015
I filed my appearance
with the court,

26:22.048 --> 26:24.350
indicating I represent
the entire family.

26:24.384 --> 26:26.252
Which is a potential
conflict of interest.

26:26.286 --> 26:28.855
You take that up here,
not on a playground.

26:28.889 --> 26:30.991
You went to the school?

26:31.024 --> 26:32.325
Yes.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.661
What the hell
is wrong with you?

26:34.695 --> 26:36.096
What's wrong is
I think this girl

26:36.129 --> 26:38.131
may have seen or heard
something that night.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.933
Then your course of action

26:39.966 --> 26:42.102
was to get a material
witness warrant.

26:42.135 --> 26:43.937
Your Honor,
under the circumstances--

26:43.970 --> 26:46.072
There are rules
barring contact

26:46.106 --> 26:48.074
with represented parties

26:48.108 --> 26:52.112
that especially apply
to prosecutors, Miss Gamble!

26:52.145 --> 26:54.114
She's nine years old!

26:54.147 --> 26:55.916
I believe the witness is

26:55.949 --> 26:57.383
under the control
of the defendant.

26:57.417 --> 26:59.653
You have been running about

26:59.686 --> 27:01.755
making accusation
after accusation

27:01.788 --> 27:03.423
with nothing to support it!

27:03.456 --> 27:04.958
That's why I went
to ask questions.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.427
Well, you went about it
the wrong way!

27:07.460 --> 27:10.263
You are restrained
from going near the girl.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.365
You're lucky I don't
report you to the bar!

27:12.398 --> 27:14.067
-Your Honor--
-That is all!

27:21.742 --> 27:24.911
-Do I have to do anything?
-No. I promise.

27:24.945 --> 27:26.412
We just want you
to be there.

27:26.446 --> 27:28.048
It would be good
for the jury

27:28.081 --> 27:29.783
to see you all as a family,
that's all.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.718
Okay.

27:31.752 --> 27:34.254
Jenny, could you
go out for a second?

27:34.287 --> 27:36.256
I'd like to talk
to Miss Washington.

27:36.289 --> 27:38.925
-I'll take her.
-Thank you.

27:38.959 --> 27:40.661
Come on, honey.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.399
Is this really necessary?

27:46.432 --> 27:48.735
I wouldn't ask for it
if I didn't need to.

27:48.769 --> 27:51.404
We stand a very good chance
of an acquittal here.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.839
Why risk it?

27:52.873 --> 27:55.241
The risk is her
being traumatized.

27:55.275 --> 27:57.243
She's got to sit
and listen

27:57.277 --> 28:00.246
to accusations
that her father...

28:00.280 --> 28:02.382
threw her stepmother
down the stairs.

28:02.415 --> 28:05.085
Again...

28:05.118 --> 28:08.689
I'm trying to avoid
a conviction.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.126
All right, Mr. Donnell.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.460
Call your first witness.

28:14.494 --> 28:17.063
The defense calls
Helen Gamble.

28:17.097 --> 28:20.066
Offer of proof?

28:20.100 --> 28:23.403
Miss Gamble was there
in the room

28:23.436 --> 28:24.871
with Barrett and Mr. Bay.

28:24.905 --> 28:26.807
She was the lead D. A.

28:26.840 --> 28:30.010
What's she going to say
that's not in her affidavit?

28:30.043 --> 28:32.779
Well, she will confirm
all the allegations

28:32.813 --> 28:35.381
-made in her affidavit.
-She doesn't need to.
I've heard them.

28:35.415 --> 28:36.950
Call your next witness.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.085
What about
the commonwealth's right

28:39.119 --> 28:40.854
to cross-examine
this witness?

28:40.887 --> 28:42.989
Mr. Bay?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.097
I think the court
can take judicial notice

28:51.131 --> 28:53.233
we dispute
Miss Gamble's claims.

28:53.266 --> 28:55.268
The court of appeals

28:55.301 --> 28:58.304
ordered a full evidentiary
hearing on this issue.

28:58.338 --> 29:00.907
I will enter her affidavit
into evidence.

29:00.941 --> 29:02.175
Call your next witness,
please.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.910
I object to this!

29:03.944 --> 29:05.912
If you have
any other witnesses,

29:05.946 --> 29:08.014
you'd better call them.

29:08.048 --> 29:10.984
Otherwise, this evidentiary
hearing is over.

29:11.017 --> 29:14.387
The defense objects to
the court acting out of ego!

29:14.420 --> 29:16.890
The defense wants it noted
for the record

29:16.923 --> 29:18.992
that the trial court judge
is angered by the fact

29:19.025 --> 29:21.562
that the appeals court
ruled he was in error,

29:21.595 --> 29:24.565
and the defense wants
its objection noted
for the record

29:24.598 --> 29:27.167
that the trial court judge
is not complying

29:27.200 --> 29:29.269
with the order
of the appeals court.

29:33.907 --> 29:36.309
I will repeat--

29:36.342 --> 29:40.480
Call your next witness,
or the hearing is over.

29:40.514 --> 29:43.116
My next witness, Kyle Barrett,
hasn't arrived yet.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.451
We'll adjourn until he does.
One hour.

29:45.485 --> 29:47.153
(gavel bangs)

29:47.187 --> 29:49.022
(crowd murmuring)

30:00.534 --> 30:02.402
So we have a crime

30:02.435 --> 30:06.406
where the victim says
it didn't happen.

30:06.439 --> 30:09.075
Now, did she
once claim it did?

30:09.109 --> 30:10.076
Yes.

30:10.110 --> 30:12.312
But, as she explained,

30:12.345 --> 30:15.048
she was confused and angry,

30:15.081 --> 30:17.183
and she lashed out.

30:17.217 --> 30:19.152
And all those statements came

30:19.185 --> 30:21.321
when she was
emotionally unsteady,

30:21.354 --> 30:23.223
as she told you.

30:23.256 --> 30:26.593
But now she's admitting
the truth--

30:26.627 --> 30:28.862
It never happened.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.864
All those prior statements
she made?

30:30.897 --> 30:32.032
Made up.

30:33.534 --> 30:35.636
We don't just have
reasonable doubt

30:35.669 --> 30:37.571
as to his guilt here;

30:37.604 --> 30:41.474
we have proof
of his innocence.

30:41.508 --> 30:46.012
She finally let go of her rage

30:46.046 --> 30:49.650
and let the truth come out.

30:49.683 --> 30:52.452
If only we could get
a zealous district attorney

30:52.485 --> 30:53.920
to do the same.

31:01.528 --> 31:05.198
Yes, that's the only reason
we're here--

31:05.231 --> 31:08.334
Because I'm an angry,
overzealous district attorney

31:08.368 --> 31:12.005
who cannot let go of her rage.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.307
Do you really believe that?

31:14.340 --> 31:16.977
Nothing to do with the fact

31:17.010 --> 31:20.480
that an unconscious woman
was rushed to the hospital.

31:20.514 --> 31:22.916
Let's just forget
the 911 call

31:22.949 --> 31:24.250
where the victim was screaming

31:24.284 --> 31:26.219
while the defendant
pursued her.

31:26.252 --> 31:29.355
This isn't the day after,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.625
It's not the week after.

31:31.658 --> 31:36.129
These charges were filed
six months ago.

31:36.162 --> 31:38.464
Margaret Wakefield
has stuck to her story

31:38.498 --> 31:40.466
since last spring.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.603
It's only after
she and her husband

31:42.636 --> 31:44.971
talked two days ago
about reconciling

31:45.005 --> 31:46.973
that she suddenly rises up
and says,

31:47.007 --> 31:49.309
"Gee, I think I was mistaken.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.477
It must have been
an accident."

31:54.180 --> 31:56.316
Do you really believe that?

31:58.484 --> 32:01.454
I'm sure Margaret Wakefield
is a little frightened.

32:04.324 --> 32:06.627
Her husband Robert
supported her.

32:06.660 --> 32:10.030
He's the father of her step--

32:14.367 --> 32:16.670
He's the father
of her stepdaughter.

32:16.703 --> 32:20.373
She's suddenly faced
with losing everything,

32:20.406 --> 32:23.610
and she thinks,
"Maybe we can work it out."

32:23.644 --> 32:25.311
They talk
about reconciling,

32:25.345 --> 32:27.347
and suddenly, poof.

32:27.380 --> 32:30.216
It's an accident.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.018
He threw her down the stairs.

32:32.052 --> 32:34.487
It can't be erased,

32:34.521 --> 32:36.256
even at the victim's
own request.

32:38.659 --> 32:41.595
It happened.

32:41.628 --> 32:44.230
And it will probably
happen again.

32:45.265 --> 32:46.667
You heard that tape.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.735
You heard those statements
to the police,

32:48.769 --> 32:50.671
to the hospital.

32:50.704 --> 32:53.574
"Robert did it.

32:53.607 --> 32:55.642
Robert pushed me."

32:59.445 --> 33:01.147
She can say whatever
she wants to now.

33:04.117 --> 33:06.687
But she didn't take an oath
to uphold the law.

33:09.122 --> 33:10.390
The 12 of you did.

33:15.495 --> 33:18.031
Could you please state
your name and address

33:18.064 --> 33:19.065
for the record, sir?

33:19.099 --> 33:20.333
Kyle Barrett.

33:20.366 --> 33:23.303
1505 North Street,
Walpole, Massachusetts.

33:23.336 --> 33:25.506
Mr. Barrett, you are
the brother of Karen Wallace,

33:25.539 --> 33:26.773
is that correct?

33:26.807 --> 33:28.341
Was the brother,

33:28.374 --> 33:30.511
until your client killed her.

33:30.544 --> 33:33.479
Mr. Barrett, in preparation
for your testimony

33:33.514 --> 33:35.348
at Scott Wallace's trial,
you had a meeting

33:35.381 --> 33:36.817
with Richard Bay
and Helen Gamble,

33:36.850 --> 33:38.051
did you not?

33:38.084 --> 33:40.120
On the advice of counsel,

33:40.153 --> 33:42.188
I'm exercising
my 5th amendment right

33:42.222 --> 33:44.558
not to answer your question.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.729
Excuse me?

33:50.196 --> 33:52.232
Your Honor,
I'm Matthew Stone,

33:52.265 --> 33:53.767
Mr. Barrett's attorney.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.770
Though my client maintains
his complete innocence

33:56.803 --> 34:00.607
with respect to
any allegation of perjury,

34:00.641 --> 34:03.343
given Helen Gamble's
beliefs,

34:03.376 --> 34:04.845
I have to advise him
not to answer these questions.

34:04.878 --> 34:07.180
Your client is not
on trial here, Mr. Stone.

34:07.213 --> 34:10.315
Understood.
But with the possibility
that charges could file,

34:10.350 --> 34:12.719
he has a 5th amendment right,

34:12.753 --> 34:16.121
and it would be foolish
for him not to exercise it.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.262
You have
to grant him immunity.

34:22.295 --> 34:24.697
-It's the only way
you can force him--
-You can forget that.

34:24.731 --> 34:27.266
If this man committed perjury
in a first-degree murder trial,

34:27.300 --> 34:29.101
I am not going
to offer up immunity

34:29.135 --> 34:30.469
like a stick of gum!

34:30.504 --> 34:32.606
I have to be allowed
to question him!

34:32.639 --> 34:34.741
I can't force him to waive
his 5th amendment right!

34:34.775 --> 34:36.743
We're being denied
our evidentiary hearing!

34:36.777 --> 34:39.112
Why don't you supply me
with some precedent

34:39.145 --> 34:40.781
where I get to take away

34:40.813 --> 34:42.447
his right
not to incriminate himself,

34:42.482 --> 34:44.484
and I'll be glad
to accommodate you.

34:46.587 --> 34:49.289
Is it your client's intent
to take the 5th

34:49.322 --> 34:51.224
on every question
he's asked?

34:51.257 --> 34:52.525
Yes, Your Honor.

34:54.661 --> 34:56.630
Everybody get out.

34:56.663 --> 34:58.799
I'm going to take 10 minutes
to think about this,

34:58.832 --> 35:01.768
then we'll reconvene.

35:01.802 --> 35:03.336
Out!

35:08.842 --> 35:10.844
I thought you quit.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.449
I'm not supposed
to talk to you, Helen.

35:18.719 --> 35:20.320
You seem to be doing
a lot of things

35:20.353 --> 35:22.656
you're not supposed
to do, Margaret.

35:26.192 --> 35:29.530
You know, I couldn't
figure it out--

35:29.563 --> 35:31.598
Then finally it hit me.

35:33.567 --> 35:34.668
You're not going
back to Robert

35:34.701 --> 35:37.170
because you love him.

35:37.203 --> 35:39.673
You're doing it
to protect Jennifer,

35:39.706 --> 35:43.443
because it's the only way
you can.

35:43.476 --> 35:44.745
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:44.778 --> 35:47.447
-Yes, you do.
-No, I don't.

35:49.550 --> 35:51.184
The reason
you're so horrified

35:51.217 --> 35:52.686
that he'd only get
three years in prison

35:52.719 --> 35:54.187
is because
when he got out,

35:54.220 --> 35:55.856
Jennifer
would only be 12,

35:55.889 --> 35:57.490
and you're worried
he'd get custody again.

35:59.526 --> 36:02.328
Faced with that,
you decide to reconcile

36:02.362 --> 36:06.466
so you can always
be there to protect her.

36:06.499 --> 36:09.302
Margaret, he might not
get custody.

36:09.335 --> 36:12.673
-Under the law...
-I know the presumption,

36:12.706 --> 36:15.408
but there's
a good chance he would.

36:16.577 --> 36:18.845
And then what?

36:18.879 --> 36:23.316
What happens the next time
he pushes you down the stairs?

36:25.852 --> 36:27.621
Honey?

36:27.654 --> 36:30.991
Everything okay?

36:31.024 --> 36:34.695
Everything's just swell,
Mr. Wakefield.

36:34.728 --> 36:36.830
Come on.

36:51.645 --> 36:53.514
WOMAN: All rise.

37:07.961 --> 37:09.963
WOMAN: Be seated.

37:15.068 --> 37:17.804
I have been ordered
by the court of appeals

37:17.838 --> 37:20.941
to conduct a full hearing
into this perjury business.

37:20.974 --> 37:24.711
That hearing has been thwarted
by the primary witness

37:24.745 --> 37:26.947
exercising
his 5th amendment right

37:26.980 --> 37:29.516
not to testify.

37:29.550 --> 37:32.919
The conviction of Scott Wallace
is hereby set aside.

37:32.953 --> 37:36.022
It is the order of this court
that he be granted a new trial.

37:36.056 --> 37:37.524
-Adjourned.
-(gavel bangs)

37:55.942 --> 37:57.978
We fully intend to retry him.

37:58.011 --> 37:59.813
This man committed murder,

37:59.846 --> 38:01.682
and the district attorney's
office

38:01.715 --> 38:02.983
will pursue him
until his home in prison

38:03.016 --> 38:04.685
becomes permanent.

38:04.718 --> 38:06.352
Were you surprised
by the ruling?

38:06.386 --> 38:08.354
Shocked is more like it,
and outraged.

38:08.388 --> 38:10.991
Judge Wolf certainly acted
within his discretion,

38:11.024 --> 38:13.359
but the reality here is,

38:13.393 --> 38:15.696
a killer could get
back on the street,

38:15.729 --> 38:18.398
and I find that horrifying.

38:18.431 --> 38:20.466
What will Helen Gamble's
role be in the next trial?

38:20.500 --> 38:23.003
I will be prosecuting.

38:23.036 --> 38:25.338
I'll be in charge.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.574
Look at him.
Every time he loses,
he shrinks an inch.

38:27.608 --> 38:30.844
Amazing. They do it
all over again now.

38:30.877 --> 38:32.412
It's amazing.

38:34.548 --> 38:35.582
Is it exciting?

38:35.616 --> 38:36.750
The new trials?

38:36.783 --> 38:39.920
-Being pregnant.
-Oh. (laughs)

38:39.953 --> 38:42.355
Yeah, it's really amazing.

38:42.388 --> 38:43.990
(chuckles)

38:44.024 --> 38:45.526
You think Rebecca is?

38:45.559 --> 38:47.828
I doubt it.

38:47.861 --> 38:49.596
Well, the book and the test--

38:49.630 --> 38:51.598
It's kind of
an elaborate scam,

38:51.632 --> 38:53.366
even for Lucy.

38:53.399 --> 38:55.602
Yeah, but,
between you and me,

38:55.636 --> 38:58.605
I don't think
Rebecca's really pregnant,

38:58.639 --> 39:00.541
and I don't think Lucy's
playing any trick.

39:00.574 --> 39:02.776
Then how did that book get here?

39:02.809 --> 39:05.879
I ordered it.

39:05.912 --> 39:07.914
Why?

39:10.483 --> 39:13.787
Because I'm pregnant.

39:19.793 --> 39:22.629
So I'm not
convicted anymore?

39:22.663 --> 39:24.631
I mean,
I'm not convicted.

39:24.665 --> 39:26.667
No.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.669
The verdict is out.

39:32.973 --> 39:34.908
Do we do it again?

39:34.941 --> 39:37.644
We do it all over again.

39:38.812 --> 39:41.615
And this time
we're gonna win.

39:43.016 --> 39:44.551
Okay.

39:47.521 --> 39:49.690
These drugs make me weak.

39:49.723 --> 39:51.825
They're to help you rest.

39:51.858 --> 39:54.127
You just get better now,
okay, buddy?

39:54.160 --> 39:55.495
Okay.

39:55.529 --> 39:57.030
You get better.

40:00.233 --> 40:01.768
Next time...

40:04.538 --> 40:06.006
...we win.

40:08.141 --> 40:10.544
We win.

40:20.554 --> 40:22.989
The defendant
will please rise.

40:28.895 --> 40:30.931
Madam foreperson,

40:30.964 --> 40:33.734
the jury has reached
its unanimous verdict?

40:33.767 --> 40:35.001
We have, Your Honor.

40:35.035 --> 40:36.603
What say you?

40:36.637 --> 40:39.105
Commonwealth
v. Robert Wakefield--

40:39.139 --> 40:41.708
On the charge
of assault and battery

40:41.742 --> 40:44.778
with intent to cause
serious physical injury,

40:44.811 --> 40:46.613
we find the defendant,
Robert Wakefield,

40:46.647 --> 40:48.481
not guilty.

40:48.515 --> 40:50.851
JUDGE HILLER:
Members of the jury,

40:50.884 --> 40:52.819
this completes your service.

40:52.853 --> 40:55.622
You're dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

40:55.656 --> 40:57.658
The defendant is free to go.

40:57.691 --> 41:00.827
This matter is adjourned.

41:02.162 --> 41:03.930
Thank you.

41:05.666 --> 41:07.934
Thank you, Rebecca.
Thank you so much.

41:07.968 --> 41:09.469
Congratulations.

42:06.292 --> 42:08.595
♪ (theme)

42:31.351 --> 42:33.286
You stinker!
