18:46.875 --> 18:48.544
OH, THERE IT IS.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.420
- WHO ORDERED
THE COTTON CANDY?

18:50.504 --> 18:52.214
[groans]

18:52.297 --> 18:56.552
- YOU BLOWEDED UP
MY TEDDY BEAR!

18:56.635 --> 18:58.554
[cries]

18:58.637 --> 19:01.265
- GAH!

19:01.348 --> 19:04.685
I CAN'T STAND CHILDREN CRYING!

19:04.768 --> 19:06.770
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
I GIVE THEM ALL PRESENTS!

19:06.854 --> 19:12.067
I'D LIKE TO GIVE THEM ANOTHER
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY EXTRAS!

19:12.150 --> 19:13.485
- [crying]

19:13.569 --> 19:15.571
- OH, WELL, I'LL JUST
HAVE TO DESTROY HIM INSTEAD.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.030
[laser gun powering up]

19:17.114 --> 19:17.865
- NO, WAIT!
[laser gun powering down]

19:17.948 --> 19:19.867
I HAVE A PRESENT FOR HIM.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.910
HERE, TAKE THIS ONE.

19:21.994 --> 19:22.911
- WHOA!

19:22.995 --> 19:24.246
A SMORK!

19:24.329 --> 19:29.459
- ACTUALLY, IT'S A
STUBLUBDUBLUBMUBDUBLUB-ORK.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.752
I ASKED FOR
SOME MODIFICATIONS.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.628
- WAIT!

19:31.712 --> 19:34.423
THAT TOY IS
MEANT FOR A...

19:34.506 --> 19:36.383
FANBOY.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.759
WHAT IF HE CRIES?

19:37.843 --> 19:38.719
THEN I'LL
HAVE TO DESTROY HIM!

19:38.802 --> 19:42.431
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.892
BECAUSE...

19:44.975 --> 19:47.227
I'M FANBOY!

19:47.311 --> 19:47.769
- [gasps]

19:47.853 --> 19:51.440
A HUMAN BOY?

19:51.523 --> 19:54.610
POSING AS A BLUE BERRY?

19:54.693 --> 19:57.446
- I'M SORRY, MAN-ARCTICA.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.240
I ASKED FOR A MORK
BUT I REALLY WANTED A SMORK.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.658
AND WHEN I
TRIED TO CHANGE IT,

20:01.742 --> 20:04.453
MY WISHCICLE TURNED RED
AND THEN WE SNUCK INTO THE IGLOO

20:04.536 --> 20:05.996
AND THEN CHUM CHUM
WAS SWEDISH

20:06.079 --> 20:07.623
AND "RIPIDEE, RIPIDOO."

20:07.706 --> 20:09.082
AND THEN WE MADE
THESE TERRIBLE TOYS

20:09.166 --> 20:11.835
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO END UP
ON THE NAUGHTY LIST FOREVER.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.295
OH, AND PLEASE
DON'T MAKE ME END UP

20:13.378 --> 20:14.463
ON THE NAUGHTY LIST FOREVER!

20:14.546 --> 20:17.299
[cries]

20:17.382 --> 20:20.636
- IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.721
YOU CAN STOP CRYING.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.933
- [cries]
- I SAID STOP CRYING.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.769
YOU HAVE
THREE SECONDS TO COMPLY!

20:28.852 --> 20:33.482
- [whimpering] I'M SORRY
I RUINED YOUR ICEMAS PRESENT.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.816
PLEASE, TAKE MY SMORK.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.569
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.821
- MM! UNH! UGH!

20:39.905 --> 20:41.198

20:41.281 --> 20:44.242
THEN LET GO

20:44.326 --> 20:46.161
GAH!

20:46.244 --> 20:47.120
[laughs]

20:47.204 --> 20:48.205
- HEY, FANBOY?

20:48.288 --> 20:49.998
ISN'T YOUR SMORK
WAY MORE DANGEROUS

20:50.082 --> 20:50.999
THAN THE TEDDY BEAR?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.459
- OH, YEAH, WAY MORE.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.086
[electric blasts]
- AAH! AAH!

20:54.169 --> 20:55.087

21:05.555 --> 21:08.850

21:10.602 --> 21:13.772
I KNEW YOU WERE
FANBOY ALL ALONG.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.942
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO LEARN THE TRUE MEANING

21:17.025 --> 21:18.276
OF ICEMAS.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.695
- REALLY?

21:19.778 --> 21:22.864
- NO, BUT THAT'S MY STORY
AND I'M STICKING TO IT.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.659
I CAN'T HAVE KIDS FINDING OUT
HOW EASY IT IS

21:25.742 --> 21:27.494
TO GET INTO THE IGLOO!

21:27.577 --> 21:30.789

[roars]

21:37.754 --> 21:41.717
[yelps]

21:41.800 --> 21:43.635
- WELL, IT'S GETTING LATE.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.846

DELIVERIES TO MAKE.

21:45.929 --> 21:46.680

21:55.605 --> 21:56.606
I UNDERSTAND.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.400
