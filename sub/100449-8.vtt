WEBVTT

00:04.963 --> 00:06.757
Previously on Homeland...

00:06.840 --> 00:09.801
speaking Dari

00:11.970 --> 00:13.472
Death.

00:18.393 --> 00:21.438
G'ulom had a one‐on‐one
with Hayes yesterday.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.898
First thing this morning,

00:22.981 --> 00:25.067
Hayes demands new voices
on Afghanistan.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.502
Guess who's in the Oval Office
right now.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.154
John Zabel.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.740
Get in there before Zabel
gets his feet under the table.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.242
Make the case.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.994
Haqqani dies,
Afghanistan goes up in flames.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.247
It took ten years
to get Osama bin Laden,

00:38.330 --> 00:43.418
but he avenged Ralph Warner's
murder in, what, three days.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.254
Well, I can hardly claim credit.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.089
I think that you can, sir.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.591
It's what that part
of the world understands.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.926
An eye for an eye,

00:51.009 --> 00:53.679
a punch in the fucking nose.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.098
I had it.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.642
The black box.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.520
He sold it to some other guy.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.647
They took it somewhere,
it was Koa or Kowa‐‐

01:04.730 --> 01:05.941
- Kohat.
- Yeah.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.276
Yeah.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.278
It's Jalal Haqqani,
I'm sure of it.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.238
G'ulom has his father,
he has Max.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.573
This is a bad situation.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.283
Where the hell
is the extraction team?

01:14.366 --> 01:14.908
They can't put together
an operation

01:14.992 --> 01:15.659
in a matter of hours.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.328
I need a gun.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.145
You get into trouble,
I'm leaving you.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.012 --> 01:36.972
No.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.475
No.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.609
Get back, get back!

01:58.869 --> 02:01.079
The World Trade Center,
Tower Number One

02:01.163 --> 02:04.041
is on fire!

02:04.124 --> 02:06.060
I missed something
once before. I won't‐‐

02:06.084 --> 02:09.170
I can't let that happen again!

02:09.253 --> 02:11.715
An American prisoner of war
has been turned.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.900
You're a disgrace
to your nation,

02:12.924 --> 02:14.009
Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.303
You're a traitor
and a terrorist,

02:16.386 --> 02:19.389
and now it's time
to pay for that.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.600
Are you accusing me
of something?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.477
You really do not remember?

02:23.560 --> 02:24.770
Remember what?

02:24.853 --> 02:27.939
We may be dealing with
a compromised officer here.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.150
You had a relationship
complicated enough

02:30.233 --> 02:31.026
to lie about.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.445
Yeah, it's complicated.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.863
I lost seven months of my life.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.699
To my Russian handler?

02:37.783 --> 02:39.534
Is our strategy working?

02:39.618 --> 02:42.329
And you will become
the focus of an investigation

02:42.412 --> 02:45.582
that will define
the rest of your life.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.560
That not every
problem in the Middle East

02:47.584 --> 02:50.545
deserves a military solution.

02:50.629 --> 02:54.132
Because this whole country
went stupid crazy after 9/11.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.551
Carrie, you're not yourself.

02:56.635 --> 03:00.097
I'm still putting
the pieces together.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.766
Please, God,
tell me you have it.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.062
Is there no fucking line?

03:07.145 --> 03:09.231
I believe you.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.191
No one else will.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.996
Speaking Dari

04:49.372 --> 04:52.751
Mr. President,
Ben Hayes here.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.711
I need your help.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.671
I've got a, uh, situation,

04:56.755 --> 04:58.840
a video of an American
held hostage

04:58.924 --> 05:00.008
by Haissam Haqqani's son.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.469
Now, the second you execute
Haqqani, my guy dies.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.274
Abdul, you there?

05:17.442 --> 05:18.360
Yes.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.988
Well, as we discussed,
nerves are quite raw

05:22.072 --> 05:23.156
in this country right now.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.616
People are confused,

05:24.699 --> 05:26.451
and I don't want to add
to that confusion

05:26.535 --> 05:28.495
by having even a single
additional American death.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.401
General, we're asking you to
hold off on Haqqani's execution

05:35.460 --> 05:39.422
until this hostage situation
is resolved.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.758
Haqqani was tried and convicted.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.010
No one is disputing that.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.721
A delay now
will make me look weak.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.391
Not to your partners, sir.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.402
I'm meeting with my military
advisors as soon as we hang up.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.296
We will devise a course
of action to resolve this,

06:02.320 --> 06:07.117
but until then,
we need some time.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.038
Fine.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.251
Thank you.

06:16.334 --> 06:20.755
I can give you 24 hours.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.099
When's Special Ops getting here?

06:31.182 --> 06:32.285
That's still in flux.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.561
No‐‐what's that mean?
Soon? Never?

06:34.644 --> 06:36.664
I'm about to go into a meeting
to discuss just that.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.523
How are things there?

06:38.607 --> 06:40.358
Quiet, to be honest.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.485
Quiet but fucked.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.589
Well, I want you to
know there's some good news.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.549
President Hayes just got a stay
of execution for Haqqani.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.784
- For how long?
- Bought us some time,

06:49.868 --> 06:51.786
which is what we need.

06:51.870 --> 06:55.248
So stay put and let me see
what I can come up with, okay?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.792
Carrie?

06:57.876 --> 07:00.545
Max situation is stable.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.214
He's on the radar at the
highest level of government.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.311
Tell me we've got a plan.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.229
Beginnings of one.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.815
A lot of question marks.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.293
How's the situation
at the compound?

07:22.317 --> 07:24.444
Quiet, she said.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.071
She still with the Russian?

07:26.154 --> 07:28.948
I didn't ask.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.202
Do they see us?

07:34.079 --> 07:36.247
Hello.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.540
Kabul, you there?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.250
Yes, we're here,
Mr. President.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.002
Good, good.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.921
If you haven't heard,
I bought us some time.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.299
We have a window.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.052
So how do we resolve
this situation?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.806
Sir, if I may,
this is Scott Ryan

07:52.889 --> 07:54.557
for CIA Special Operations
in Kabul.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.018
We're marshalling resources
in Jalalabad.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.729
Good.
When do we move?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.440
Well, sir, uh,

08:02.524 --> 08:03.233
this is the compound
where Max Piotrowski

08:03.316 --> 08:05.694
is being held hostage.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.904
It's isolated and exposed,

08:07.987 --> 08:10.365
which means any approach
is easily spotted.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.867
Uh, according to a source
on the ground,

08:12.951 --> 08:16.746
our target is held hostage
by 11, possibly 12 Taliban

08:16.830 --> 08:19.416
in this building here.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.710
According to this same source,

08:21.793 --> 08:25.213
he's partially incapacitated
by a gunshot wound,

08:25.296 --> 08:27.674
also restrained
and heavily guarded.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.136
His captors need only
a second to defeat our mission

08:31.219 --> 08:33.280
by putting a gun to his head
and pulling the trigger.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.347
What does that mean?

08:35.432 --> 08:37.892
It means we travel by night,
sir, and by ground.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.312
Even baffled helicopters
are audible for several miles

08:41.395 --> 08:42.813
in this landscape.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.566
Last distance
will have to be on foot.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.114
What are the odds?

08:55.744 --> 08:58.705
You must have thought
about that already.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.414
What are the odds?

08:59.497 --> 09:02.667
Candidly, sir, at best 50/50.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.346
Fifty‐fifty?

09:15.430 --> 09:16.931
It's not terrible.

09:17.015 --> 09:17.932
The United States versus
a dozen punks, yeah, it is.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.226
Sir‐‐

09:20.310 --> 09:21.590
Bin Laden himself
was 80 percent.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.234
Sir, I wonder if we're looking
at this all wrong.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.484
What do you mean?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.945
Ha, I mean,
a return to first principles.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.156
The United States does not
negotiate with terrorists.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.657
- Period.
- Okay.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.868
The American people
have to accept that.

09:36.951 --> 09:42.457
Also, frankly, sir, who is
this Max Piotrowski anyway?

09:42.540 --> 09:43.601
- He's not‐not a soldier.
- No.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.002
The U. S. government
can't be expected

09:46.086 --> 09:48.213
to come to the rescue
of every adventurer

09:48.296 --> 09:50.381
who gets himself
in trouble overseas.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.637
A failed rescue
can sink a presidency.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.971
Yeah, Jimmy Carter.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.389
Exactly.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.726
And as for upside,
I'm sorry but...

10:01.810 --> 10:03.561
some guy named Max

10:03.645 --> 10:06.231
is not the same
as Osama bin Laden.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.776
Yeah.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.752
Excuse me.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.296
May I help you,
Mr. Wellington?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.631
No, thank you.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.218
John said he left
a document for me,

11:17.302 --> 11:19.721
but I found it.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.242
Open the door.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.136
I was about to be shot.
They stopped my execution.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.638
Yes.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.264
They won't tell me why.

12:03.348 --> 12:07.852
Your son Jalal,
he's taken an American hostage,

12:07.936 --> 12:10.980
someone who was working for me,

12:11.064 --> 12:15.109
which, terrible as that is,
bought us some time

12:15.193 --> 12:16.193
to stop this.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.159
This will happen in a day

12:23.243 --> 12:25.453
or a week, but soon.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.873
So it's up to you
to continue what we started.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.007
Wait a second.
Wait a minute, wait a‐‐

12:38.091 --> 12:40.218
Hold on, hold on.
What are you doing?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.053
Where are you taking him?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.138
Okay, okay.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.817
We had an agreement.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.485
Twenty‐four hours.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.570
- Talk to your president.
- I will.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.780
Do it.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.782
You'll find he's come
to his senses.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.079
You kill him, there will
be blood in the streets.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.789
There's always blood
in the streets.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.875
No, the Taliban is divided now.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.039
This will unify them.

13:14.085 --> 13:17.630
And I will deal
with them like I always have,

13:17.714 --> 13:19.173
with or without you.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.782
Something's going on.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.325
I can't tell what,
but something.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.620
Carrie.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.790
Carrie.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.210
What?

15:22.046 --> 15:23.089
Oh, no.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.552
- When did this happen?
- Just now.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.852
- What is it?
- It's Max.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.534
It looks like they're
taking him somewhere.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.651
We gotta follow them.

15:43.734 --> 15:44.902
Can you get a drone overhead?

15:44.986 --> 15:46.237
Well, I'll call from the car,

15:46.320 --> 15:48.781
but we gotta keep them in sight.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.578
Eh‐‐let me see.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.499
Okay, Jalal's outside.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.810
Let's get ready.
They're about to leave.

15:59.834 --> 16:00.918
Speaking Pashto

16:16.851 --> 16:17.851
Carrie!

17:15.867 --> 17:18.954
All yours.
I got ten more.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.086
You really wanna do this?

17:25.169 --> 17:27.189
Well, hey, you're the one
who invited himself in here.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.924
After you stole
that speech off my desk.

17:30.007 --> 17:30.925
Oh, that's what you call this?
A speech?

17:31.008 --> 17:34.095
- President asked for it.
- For this?

17:34.178 --> 17:36.430
- Uh‐huh.
- Really? Uh...

17:39.600 --> 17:42.603
"Secure the Afghan/Pakistan
border."

17:42.687 --> 17:44.438
You know how long that is?

17:44.522 --> 17:46.941
I know you can't crush
the Taliban

17:47.024 --> 17:49.336
when they escape into Pakistan
every time they're attacked.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.112
Fifteen hundred miles.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.655
A quarter million men
to secure it.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.906
American blood.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.408
No, we make
the Pakistanis do it.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.535
Oh, well, good luck with that
after the president

17:57.618 --> 18:02.164
calls them, um, "a failed
and duplicitous state."

18:02.248 --> 18:04.083
You know they're an ally, right?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.252
I'd say that's debatable.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.254
Well, and I'd say
for someone who's never been

18:08.337 --> 18:09.856
in the military,
you have way too many pictures

18:09.880 --> 18:13.134
of tanks on your wall.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.695
This isn't a speech.
You know what this is?

18:14.719 --> 18:16.637
It's‐it's idiocy.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.472
No, no, it's not just that.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.225
It is idiocy that has
already been rejected

18:21.309 --> 18:23.811
by three previous
administrations.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.814
The world changes, and you,
you do not.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.317
How did you even get in here?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.987
I was invited
after you were stupid enough

18:33.070 --> 18:35.114
to get two presidents killed!

18:58.971 --> 19:00.348
Carrie?

19:00.431 --> 19:00.723
He's dead.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.224
Max is.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.855
I told you where he was.
You did nothing.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.358
Special Operations
wouldn't move.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.652
No, you didn't make them move.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.403
You brought him to this country.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.322
It was your job to protect him.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.699
That was your fucking job.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.513
You can tell Special Ops
it's safe now.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.041
The six Taliban teenagers they
were so scared of are gone.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.960
They can come pick up
Max's body.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.296
Will you do that?

19:32.380 --> 19:33.631
Yeah.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.551
Let me know when they're coming.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.012
Don't hang up.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.598
Carrie, you know
you can't do this.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.475
Do what?

19:44.558 --> 19:48.187
Keep running around out there
with a GRU officer.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.064
That GRU officer
was the only person

19:50.147 --> 19:51.732
who gave a shit
what happened to Max.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.484
You gotta come in.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.374
Well, I'm with Max.
You know where to find me.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.486
- We'll take him inside.
- No, wait.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.662
I want to do it.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.398
Speaking Pashto

21:17.943 --> 21:20.905
speaking Pashto

23:17.062 --> 23:19.523
shouting in Pashto

23:27.031 --> 23:28.741
Allahu akbar!

23:31.619 --> 23:32.762
‐ Mr. President‐‐
‐ Mr. President‐‐

23:32.786 --> 23:33.986
- One voice.
- Sir, I‐‐

23:34.038 --> 23:36.123
Both of you!

23:36.206 --> 23:37.958
Now, I have got an important
speech tomorrow

23:38.042 --> 23:40.878
to tell the American people
where we are

23:40.961 --> 23:43.297
and where we're going,

23:43.380 --> 23:45.633
and I have got to have
something to say.

23:45.716 --> 23:46.735
Sir, I've given you
something to say.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.637
It's what we talked about,
strong, decisive action.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.140
We've already got a war
going with the Taliban.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.976
Do we really want to start one
with Pakistan too?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.978
So what do you suggest?

23:59.855 --> 24:02.566
A victory lap, plain and simple.

24:02.650 --> 24:07.655
Haqqani is dead,
the man who killed Warner.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.990
If we can't find a major win
in that fact alone,

24:10.074 --> 24:12.368
there's something wrong with us.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.960
Work it out.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.765
Congratulations, you win.
We do nothing.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.351
- Nothing stupid.
- Doing nothing is stupid.

24:37.434 --> 24:37.935
It's why we got
an endless war on our hands.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.521
Look...

24:40.604 --> 24:43.983
the president obviously
wants some kind of‐‐

24:44.066 --> 24:45.418
The president doesn't
know what he wants.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.695
We can at least agree on that.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.322
Okay.

24:50.406 --> 24:54.368
How 'bout we sit down,
your office,

24:54.451 --> 24:57.121
put something on paper for him,

24:57.204 --> 24:58.914
try to find some common ground.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.341
Give me five minutes.
I need to get some coffee.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.769
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.563
Can I call you back?
I'm a little busy.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.086
This will only take a minute.
Listen.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.192
Um, I got a new job.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.528
West Wing, I heard.
How is it there?

25:29.611 --> 25:31.864
It's crawling with idiots,
if you wanna know the truth.

25:31.947 --> 25:35.576
The same people who got Warner
blown out of the sky,

25:35.659 --> 25:37.953
everywhere I turn,
there they are in my way.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.455
Who is?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.123
- David Wellington.
- Uh‐huh.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.001
- Saul Berenson.
- Okay.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.253
Some guy named Ryan.

25:46.336 --> 25:47.713
Scott Ryan.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.382
A cabal of fat‐ass leftovers,

25:50.466 --> 25:53.218
masters of the art
of doing nothing.

25:53.302 --> 25:56.388
- So what do you want?
- What do you think I want?

25:56.472 --> 25:58.307
Kompromat.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.230
On‐on one of them,
all of them, I‐I don't care.

26:00.309 --> 26:04.730
Anything I can use to, uh,

26:04.813 --> 26:06.815
get them to back the fuck off.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.358
- I gotta go.
- Hey.

26:08.442 --> 26:09.735
Don't worry, I'll look into it.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.418
If there's something there,
I'll find it.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.171
Speaking Pashto

27:57.551 --> 27:59.595
speaking Pashto

28:11.440 --> 28:14.693
My guys are wondering,

28:14.776 --> 28:16.695
what's your plan?

28:20.324 --> 28:22.868
Stay with Max.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.036
Go back to Kabul with him.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.753
You don't have to stay.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.255
You've done so much, and...

28:35.339 --> 28:36.089
I'm sure you don't
want to be here

28:36.173 --> 28:38.425
when the Special Ops
team arrives.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.761
No.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.405
But they don't seem to be
in a hurry to get here,

28:42.429 --> 28:46.099
so we have time.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.023
Tell me about him.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.784
Who is he?

29:06.370 --> 29:09.206
Oh, this is Max.

29:10.958 --> 29:12.376
Okay.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.006
The one I've known forever.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.429
I've told you
about my whole life.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.556
I must have said
something about him.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.183
No.

29:28.266 --> 29:31.144
You never did.

29:46.660 --> 29:50.038
Well, Max would
do anything for me.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.754
Absolutely anything.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.551
Wherever I'd go, he'd...

30:04.928 --> 30:07.389
he'd end up there by my side.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.981
And the reason
I‐I never mentioned him...

30:23.238 --> 30:26.074
Is I took him for granted.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.042
I...

30:35.125 --> 30:37.461
used him...

30:37.544 --> 30:39.671
all these years and...

30:46.803 --> 30:48.847
and now he's dead.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.786
I'm so sorry, Max.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.457
I'm so sorry.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.669
I'm so, so sorry.

31:19.753 --> 31:23.548
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.425
- I'm so sorry.
- Shh.

31:25.509 --> 31:26.509
I'm so sorry.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.766
‐ ‐ Shh.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.445
"At 11:45 yesterday morning,"

31:45.529 --> 31:47.447
the terrorist Haissam Haqqani

31:47.531 --> 31:49.783
was executed by
his own government in Kabul,

31:49.866 --> 31:53.662
following his conviction
for the downing

31:53.745 --> 31:55.789
of the helicopter carrying
the presidents

31:55.872 --> 31:58.792
"of Afghanistan
and the United States."

32:05.257 --> 32:09.553
"Let us not repeat
mistakes of the past."

32:09.636 --> 32:11.805
Let's take a pause

32:11.888 --> 32:14.349
"and savor our victory."

32:14.432 --> 32:16.518
Et cetera, et cetera.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.478
"Recommit to our own values,

32:18.562 --> 32:21.982
our own cause, our‐‐"

32:23.233 --> 32:25.485
You on board with this, John?

32:25.569 --> 32:29.072
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Good.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.741
Great stuff.
Great stuff, thank you.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.417
Great stuff.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.214
Excuse me.

32:53.555 --> 32:56.850
Claudette.

32:56.933 --> 33:00.270
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.105
You look stressed.

33:02.189 --> 33:02.647
I'm fine.

33:02.731 --> 33:05.859
You don't look fine.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.861
Wellington fucked me.

33:07.944 --> 33:08.862
Appealed to the president's
inner coward.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.615
He's about to go on national TV

33:11.698 --> 33:14.201
to announce victory
in Afghanistan and move on.

33:14.284 --> 33:18.288
So unless by some miracle
you've got a big bucket of shit

33:18.371 --> 33:19.956
I can dump on these people...

33:20.040 --> 33:22.042
I just might.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.544
It's not shit exactly.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.296
Maybe something better.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.016
What is it?

33:39.809 --> 33:41.770
From a friend
in Saudi intelligence.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.480
And remember, you owe me.

33:43.563 --> 33:46.149
Fine.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.193
- I mean it.
- Yeah. Fine.

33:50.654 --> 33:54.282
Speaking Pashto

33:54.366 --> 33:55.909
What is this?

33:55.992 --> 33:57.911
A Shura Rahbaraan.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.080
They're deciding
Haqqani's successor.

34:00.163 --> 34:00.914
When did this happen?

34:00.997 --> 34:05.293
Last night in Miranshah.
Pakistan.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.213
I know where fucking
Miranshah is.

34:08.295 --> 34:10.257
Speaking Pashto

34:11.841 --> 34:13.842
That's Jalal Haqqani?

34:13.927 --> 34:15.219
Yes, it is.
Watch.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.768
Speaking Pashto

34:24.728 --> 34:27.649
What's he saying?

34:27.732 --> 34:29.275
"The Americans
and their dogs in Kabul

34:29.359 --> 34:32.237
just executed the wrong man."

34:32.320 --> 34:34.614
His father didn't shoot down
the president.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.616
He did.

34:41.036 --> 34:43.123
It's unverified.
You can't use it.

34:45.375 --> 34:49.045
Of course not.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.129
Copy that.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.014
Pakistanis have given us
a window to fly in

34:59.097 --> 35:02.058
and pick up
Max Piotrowski's body.

35:02.142 --> 35:04.144
Special Ops will be
taking off in about an hour.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.347
- I'm going with them.
- Why?

35:05.395 --> 35:08.315
- Bring Carrie back.
- The team's been briefed.

35:08.398 --> 35:09.875
They know they may be
picking up a defector.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.319
She's not a defector.

35:12.402 --> 35:15.322
Okay, collaborator
with a Russian agent.

35:15.405 --> 35:16.966
That's what she is.
You understand that, right?

35:16.990 --> 35:19.784
Here's what I understand.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.703
While you and this
entire station were doing,

35:21.786 --> 35:22.805
as far as I can tell,
exactly nothing,

35:22.829 --> 35:25.665
she went out to find Max.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.751
She found him.
Now she's coming home.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.971
Sir.

35:40.055 --> 35:40.764
Can it wait till
after the broadcast?

35:40.847 --> 35:43.850
No, sir, I don't think so.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.935
- Will you give us a moment?
- Yes, sir.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.525
There's something
I think you need to see.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.444
Okay.

35:54.527 --> 35:57.238
Speaking Pashto

35:59.032 --> 36:00.700
Who is it?
What language is it?

36:00.784 --> 36:01.868
Why am I looking at it?

36:01.951 --> 36:03.262
That's Jalal Haqqani.
Haqqani's son.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.914
And this is why you're
looking at it, right here.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.499
Speaking Pashto

36:07.582 --> 36:08.958
Is that an RPG?

36:09.042 --> 36:10.752
The RPG.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.338
He shot down the helicopters.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.881
Speaking Pashto

36:14.964 --> 36:16.174
Jalal did?

36:16.257 --> 36:18.385
That's what he's saying.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.348
He killed the president?

36:26.142 --> 36:29.145
‐ ‐

36:37.821 --> 36:40.240
In 15 minutes,
I am going to sit in that chair

36:40.323 --> 36:41.908
and make an address
to the nation‐‐

36:41.991 --> 36:44.035
That is 90 percent horseshit,
yes.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.745
Where's Wellington?

36:45.829 --> 36:48.540
No, sir, sir, he's the one
who put you in this position.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.101
- We have to cancel.
- We can't.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.418
We have to.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.335
We preempted every network
for a major announcement.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.963
We have to give them
a major announcement.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.673
What, that we killed
the wrong guy?

36:56.756 --> 36:58.341
No.
This.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.472
What I was working on
before Wellington derailed us.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.694
Sir, it's what you brought me
to the White House for.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.446
Break with the past.
A paradigm shift.

37:19.529 --> 37:22.949
John, this isn't the time
to talk about paradigm shifts.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.993
It's exactly the time,

37:25.076 --> 37:27.245
thanks to Jalal Haqqani.

37:27.328 --> 37:28.788
He makes it possible.

37:28.872 --> 37:31.624
Seize the narrative.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.002
Call out this murderous
little shit

37:34.085 --> 37:35.336
and his backers in Pakistan.

37:35.420 --> 37:39.424
Give the American people
what they really want.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.507
Action.

38:14.250 --> 38:17.170
Allow us to pause,

38:17.253 --> 38:20.715
to draw breaths,
and I would've been wrong.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.760
We cannot relax
our vigilance for one second

38:23.843 --> 38:26.429
because the killer
of President Daoud

38:26.513 --> 38:30.183
and President Ralph Warner
did not die in Kabul.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.894
This I have decided
to share with you

38:32.977 --> 38:34.854
based on intelligence
I have just received.

38:34.938 --> 38:37.565
What is this?

38:37.649 --> 38:39.067
Live footage of Jalal Haqqani,

38:39.150 --> 38:42.028
son of Haissam Haqqani,

38:42.111 --> 38:44.322
clear and incontrovertible
evidence

38:44.405 --> 38:45.990
that he shot down

38:46.074 --> 38:47.867
the helicopters in Afghanistan,

38:47.951 --> 38:50.995
that he murdered
the peacemakers,

38:51.079 --> 38:53.540
President Daoud
and President Warner.

38:53.623 --> 38:54.749
You believe this shit?

38:54.833 --> 38:58.711
On behalf
of the American people.

38:58.795 --> 39:01.881
And I have a message for
the government of Pakistan.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.717
We know Jalal Haqqani
is operating

39:04.801 --> 39:07.720
out of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
region of your country.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.389
Oh, Christ.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.933
We call on you now to arrest him

39:12.016 --> 39:15.562
and hand him over,

39:15.645 --> 39:18.231
or we will come
and get him ourselves.

39:18.314 --> 39:20.209
- Moving out!
- All right, let's move out.

39:20.233 --> 39:23.611
Mr. Berenson, I understand
we're picking up one KIA,

39:23.695 --> 39:25.506
have to apprehend a former
agent, Carrie Mathison.

39:25.530 --> 39:30.159
We're not apprehending anyone.
Carrie wants to come in.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.959
Mission brief says
she's working with Russians.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.248
Not true.

39:35.331 --> 39:38.960
She agreed to come in.
Understood?

39:49.345 --> 39:50.763
Whoa, whoa, he's on air.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.311
And I want you,
my fellow citizens,

39:56.394 --> 39:59.355
to know that these are not
just empty words.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.524
I have called
the Joint Chiefs of Staff

40:01.608 --> 40:03.067
to the White House.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.111
I will be giving the orders.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.070
Our forces are already gathering

40:06.154 --> 40:10.491
by land, sea and air.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.243
We will not allow terror
to triumph,

40:12.327 --> 40:15.455
not anywhere in the world.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.041
What the fuck have you done?

40:18.124 --> 40:18.875
You weren't here.
The intel came in.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.501
We had to react.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.296
By putting the country
on a collision course

40:23.379 --> 40:24.964
with a nuclear power.

40:25.048 --> 40:26.400
Don't be so melodramatic.
The Pakistanis will back down.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.344
Not when you leave them
no way out.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.013
The way out is to give us
Jalal Haqqani.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.474
Yeah?
Well, about that.

40:34.557 --> 40:38.895
This was a nobody you just
turned into a folk hero.

40:38.978 --> 40:42.690
Even if they could find him,
they can't hand him over now.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.443
You are pushing us into a war

40:45.526 --> 40:48.154
we don't want and can't win.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.677
You know what
your problem is, David?

40:49.739 --> 40:53.493
You don't believe America
can win any war.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.160
Thank you.

40:54.243 --> 40:57.288
May God bless you,

40:57.372 --> 41:00.959
and may God bless
the United States of America.

41:03.002 --> 41:06.047
Very nice, sir.

41:31.531 --> 41:35.910
You know they will
give you a hard time.

41:35.994 --> 41:36.869
Saul will be there for me.

41:36.953 --> 41:39.831
Saul was there before,
but you came to me.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.626
I can't stay out here forever.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.546
Why not?

41:51.634 --> 41:53.094
Thank you.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.345
Let's hurry it up.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.014
Come on, let's go!

43:04.832 --> 43:05.832
Carrie.

43:10.046 --> 43:12.298
That's Max.

43:23.101 --> 43:25.019
Don't know if you're aware,

43:25.103 --> 43:26.938
but the world's gone to shit
since you left.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.817
Jalal Haqqani
claims he shot down

43:30.900 --> 43:33.194
the president's helicopter.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.946
You believe that?

43:35.029 --> 43:36.364
Doesn't matter.
President does.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.282
He just made a speech,

43:38.366 --> 43:40.910
threatening to invade Pakistan
if they don't turn him over.

43:44.747 --> 43:48.668
So if you know anything
that could help...

43:48.751 --> 43:49.794
I'd be grateful.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.764
I have a lead on the black box.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.893
I was hoping you'd say that.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.396
It was taken from Max,
but he knew where it went.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.106
- He told me.
- Good.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.441
We'll follow it up together.

44:12.525 --> 44:13.985
Get to the truth.

44:14.986 --> 44:17.613
Okay.

44:17.697 --> 44:19.657
But no more bullshit
about my loyalty,

44:19.740 --> 44:22.034
not from Mike, the FBI, anyone.

44:22.118 --> 44:23.786
I did what had to be done.

44:23.870 --> 44:25.621
- I know, I'm on your side.
- Are you?

44:25.705 --> 44:28.040
I am.
You know that.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.755
We need to go.

44:34.839 --> 44:36.841
Pakistanis only gave us
a small window.

44:41.512 --> 44:43.723
All right, let's go.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.236
Does Yevgeny
know about the black box?

44:57.320 --> 44:59.697
No, he thinks this was
all about Max.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.538
Ma'am, we're gonna need
to search you.

45:07.622 --> 45:09.582
- What?
- What are you doing?

45:12.960 --> 45:16.214
The fuck is going on?

45:16.297 --> 45:18.257
Restraints?

45:18.341 --> 45:19.926
What the fuck?

45:20.009 --> 45:21.195
Hey, stand down, stand down.

45:21.219 --> 45:22.887
- Back off!
- Put your weapon down.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.096
Speaking Pashto

45:24.180 --> 45:26.515
Stop. What are you doing?
All of you, put your guns down.

45:26.599 --> 45:28.142
Sir, get out of the way.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.522
Don't do this.
Come back with me.

45:33.606 --> 45:35.024
What, so we can work together?

45:35.107 --> 45:36.943
- Yes, I need you.
- In fucking handcuffs?

45:37.026 --> 45:37.944
That was a mistake.
I didn't know.

45:38.027 --> 45:40.321
- You liar.
- Carrie.

45:50.915 --> 45:54.001
Whose fucking idea was that,
guns and restraints?

45:54.085 --> 45:56.170
Mike Dunne or did you
dream it up yourself?

45:56.254 --> 45:58.047
Don't say a fucking word.

45:58.130 --> 46:00.633
Get your men
back on the helicopter.

46:04.262 --> 46:06.264
Get in.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.531
You okay?

47:12.246 --> 47:14.832
There's something
I didn't tell you.

47:14.915 --> 47:17.418
There's something else
I need to find.

47:21.464 --> 47:24.675
The flight recorder from
the president's helicopter.

47:24.759 --> 47:27.345
Max had it with him
when he was captured.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.060
I know where it is.
