<i>I've got some stuff
about how the military</i>

00:09.726 --> 00:11.963
<i>McClarenTruth would love to
help you present this to the world.</i>

00:11.966 --> 00:13.605

<i>- Yeah, a big one.</i>

00:13.728 --> 00:14.686
<i>Front page on all of them.</i>

00:14.778 --> 00:15.674
<i>That's good work.</i>

00:15.791 --> 00:19.406

Patty in a child custody case.</i>

00:19.515 --> 00:20.311
<i>Are you okay?</i>

00:20.422 --> 00:21.546
<i>Feeling a little off.</i>

00:21.645 --> 00:23.026
<i>It's been going
on for a few weeks.</i>

00:23.139 --> 00:24.343
<i>Maybe you should go
and see a doctor.</i>

00:24.446 --> 00:27.080
<i>I want you to have
the land and house.</i>

00:27.169 --> 00:29.012

going to go for that.</i>

00:29.094 --> 00:30.163

00:30.255 --> 00:31.713
<i>His name's Patrick Scully.</i>

00:31.810 --> 00:33.040
<i>Scully tried to kill me.</i>

00:33.149 --> 00:34.613
<i>And now you want
me to track him down.</i>

00:34.736 --> 00:35.660
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

00:35.754 --> 00:37.076
<i>I want to know who hired you.</i>

00:37.188 --> 00:39.560
<i>Mr. Simon, you posted</i>
<i>a leak about insider trading</i>

00:39.673 --> 00:43.428
<i>at Fund 23, and your main donor</i>
<i>had financial dealings with the</i>

00:43.525 --> 00:45.713
<i>CEO of the bank that
managed that fund.</i>

00:45.799 --> 00:49.469
<i>You said that Rutger Simon
was going to contain the problem.</i>

00:49.579 --> 00:52.240
<i>McClarenTruth has always
been more mine than yours.</i>

you telling me all this?</i>

<i>Can I take something for that?</i>

04:34.998 --> 04:39.200
<i>Yes, but supplements aren't going

04:39.202 --> 04:42.003
<i>Tell me what I have
to do, and I'll do it.</i>

04:42.005 --> 04:44.238

<i>he's anxious to move forward.</i>

05:12.135 --> 05:13.734
<i>I understand.</i>

05:13.736 --> 05:17.405
<i>You're still planning to
testify against Ms. Hewes?</i>

05:17.407 --> 05:18.806
<i>Absolutely.</i>

05:18.808 --> 05:21.809

05:21.811 --> 05:23.211
<i>Your mother has no witnesses of</i>

05:23.213 --> 05:25.880
<i>any significance and
very little evidence.</i>

05:25.882 --> 05:27.949
<i>That's
never stopped her before.</i>

05:27.951 --> 05:29.350
<i>No, but her entire</i>

05:29.352 --> 05:31.419
<i>case is based on
unsubstantiated</i>

05:31.421 --> 05:34.322
<i>claims by the victim's daughter.</i>

05:37.926 --> 05:39.527
<i>You look worried.</i>

05:39.529 --> 05:41.062
<i>I'm concerned about</i>

05:41.064 --> 05:42.830
<i>your credibility on the stand.</i>

05:42.832 --> 05:45.933
<i>We'll need to show that your
desire to testify against</i>

05:45.935 --> 05:51.239
<i>Ms. Hewes is more than
just personal animosity.</i>

05:51.241 --> 05:53.207
<i>I've found someone</i>

05:53.209 --> 05:54.842
<i>who can provide some pretty</i>

05:54.844 --> 05:56.577
<i>damning evidence to back up my</i>

05:56.579 --> 05:58.346
<i>claims against your mother.</i>

05:58.348 --> 06:00.314
<i>His name is Patrick Scully.</i>

06:00.316 --> 06:03.651
<i>Is this another
former employee?</i>

06:03.653 --> 06:06.420
<i>In a manner of speaking.</i>

06:06.422 --> 06:08.823
<i>What evidence
does this person have?</i>

06:08.825 --> 06:13.761
<i>As soon as I have more
information, I'll let you know.</i>

06:17.566 --> 06:18.833
<i>Your performance</i>

06:18.835 --> 06:21.002
<i>in the deposition left a
little to be desired.</i>

06:21.004 --> 06:23.070
<i>Well, I was blindsided.</i>

06:23.072 --> 06:25.072
<i>Yeah, but
you're our witness now.</i>

06:25.074 --> 06:26.407
<i>We can't let that happen again.</i>

06:26.409 --> 06:27.742
<i>We need to prepare you</i>

06:27.744 --> 06:30.711
<i>for anything that Ellen
Parsons might throw at you.</i>

06:30.713 --> 06:33.347
<i>And what if she asks</i>
<i>about Torben and Herreshoff?</i>

06:33.349 --> 06:34.382
<i>She won't.</i>

06:34.384 --> 06:35.583
<i>The fact that Torben was</i>

06:35.585 --> 06:37.184
<i>simultaneously an
insider trader</i>

06:37.186 --> 06:39.820
<i>and a donor to McClaren is
terrible for her case.</i>

06:39.822 --> 06:40.855
<i>She's not going to touch that.</i>

06:40.857 --> 06:45.693
<i>However, I'm interested
in Torben and Herreshoff.</i>

06:45.695 --> 06:47.428
<i>What do you mean?</i>

06:47.430 --> 06:52.867
<i>When the McClaren trial is
over, I intend to pursue them.</i>

06:55.504 --> 06:58.105
<i>Well, we never discussed that.</i>

06:58.107 --> 06:59.440
<i>No.</i>

06:59.442 --> 07:03.344
<i>But if you want me to secure new
funding for you, Mr. Simon,</i>

07:03.346 --> 07:06.280
<i>I'll need your full cooperation.</i>

07:06.282 --> 07:09.884
<i>Torben and Herreshoff
are very dangerous men.</i>

07:09.886 --> 07:14.655
<i>I'll want to know everything.</i>

07:17.693 --> 07:18.926
<i>After the trial is</i>

07:18.928 --> 07:24.398
<i>over... after Channing's
trial, then I'll tell you.</i>

07:29.171 --> 07:33.541
<i>After opening statements, Patty
will start putting on witnesses.</i>

07:33.543 --> 07:34.976
<i>She goes first?</i>

07:34.978 --> 07:36.143
<i>Yes.</i>

07:36.145 --> 07:37.778
<i>The plaintiff
always goes first.</i>

07:37.780 --> 07:39.847
<i>That's her latest witness list.</i>

07:39.849 --> 07:41.949
<i>Who are these people?</i>

07:41.951 --> 07:44.218
<i>Technical experts, mostly.</i>

07:44.220 --> 07:45.853
<i>People who can testify that you</i>

07:45.855 --> 07:47.521
<i>had the expertise to hack into</i>

07:47.523 --> 07:49.023
<i>Naomi's personal account.</i>

07:49.025 --> 07:51.025
<i>Are you worried about them?</i>

07:51.027 --> 07:52.026
<i>No.</i>

07:52.028 --> 07:53.060
<i>Patty has no one who'll get on</i>

07:53.062 --> 07:54.462
<i>the stand and show that you had</i>

07:54.464 --> 07:59.300
<i>reason to post Naomi
Walling's e-mails.</i>

07:59.302 --> 08:00.801
<i>Rutger?</i>

08:00.803 --> 08:01.969
<i>Yes.</i>

08:01.971 --> 08:03.037
<i>When Patty's done</i>

08:03.039 --> 08:05.006
<i>putting on her case,
it's my turn.</i>

08:05.008 --> 08:07.008
<i>I'm going to put you
on the stand first.</i>

08:07.010 --> 08:08.009
<i>Okay.</i>

08:08.011 --> 08:09.043
<i>On cross, Patty's</i>

08:09.045 --> 08:10.444
<i>going to press you
on Torben and</i>

08:10.446 --> 08:11.879
<i>try and rattle you again.</i>

08:11.881 --> 08:16.617
<i>But you'll be prepared for
that this time, right?</i>

08:16.619 --> 08:18.986
<i>Absolutely.</i>

08:21.857 --> 08:23.958
<i>You all right?</i>

08:23.960 --> 08:29.296
<i>Yes, just...
eager to get on with it.</i>

08:33.335 --> 08:35.736
<i>Good.</i>

08:37.874 --> 08:39.640
<i>Here you are.</i>

08:39.642 --> 08:41.909
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:43.845 --> 08:45.579
<i>I was surprised to hear from</i>

08:45.581 --> 08:47.715
<i>you, especially with the
trial about to start.</i>

08:47.717 --> 08:50.851
<i>Yes, you must be excited
to get back to court.</i>

08:50.853 --> 08:54.455
<i>Very.</i>

08:54.457 --> 08:56.857
<i>I am curious.</i>

08:56.859 --> 08:58.826
<i>Why did you go back to work for</i>

08:58.828 --> 09:00.528
<i>Ellen in the first place?</i>

09:00.530 --> 09:01.562
<i>I wanted to try my</i>

09:01.564 --> 09:04.131
<i>hand at being an attorney again.</i>

09:06.635 --> 09:08.769
<i>Also, our father was dying, and</i>

09:08.771 --> 09:11.772
<i>it was important to me
that you see him again.</i>

09:11.774 --> 09:16.711
<i>What does that have to
do with you working for Ellen?</i>

09:16.713 --> 09:18.446
<i>Would you have paid</i>

09:18.448 --> 09:20.114
<i>me any attention
if I weren't on</i>

09:20.116 --> 09:22.817
<i>the opposite side of your case?</i>

09:24.419 --> 09:28.589
<i>You wouldn't have even
returned my calls.</i>

09:36.998 --> 09:41.001
<i>What was he like
for you as a father?</i>

09:47.275 --> 09:49.376
<i>Awful.</i>

09:49.378 --> 09:51.979
<i>Until he stopped drinking.</i>

09:51.981 --> 09:56.183
<i>And even then, he wasn't
a walk in the park.</i>

09:58.020 --> 10:01.589
<i>But he did get calmer
as he got older.</i>

10:01.591 --> 10:04.158
<i>And now he can be quite
sweet, actually.</i>

10:11.399 --> 10:14.568
<i>I'd like to see him again.</i>

10:17.639 --> 10:20.641
<i>Have you decided to</i>
<i>let him give Michael the land?</i>

10:20.643 --> 10:22.643
<i>I haven't decided anything.</i>

10:22.645 --> 10:25.646
<i>I just... want to talk to him.</i>

10:28.817 --> 10:33.053
<i>Do you think he's coherent</i>
<i>enough to have a conversation?</i>

10:33.055 --> 10:36.123
<i>If you catch him
in the right moment.</i>

10:41.697 --> 10:45.533
<i>I suppose this is none of my
business, but whatever he did</i>

10:45.535 --> 10:49.770
<i>back then, you have
the power now.</i>

10:49.772 --> 10:53.140
<i>He's helpless.</i>

10:53.142 --> 10:56.777
<i>But I really think you
should try and forgive him.</i>

10:56.779 --> 11:01.081
<i>If not for his sake,
then for yours.</i>

11:01.083 --> 11:04.718
<i>Thank you for the advice.</i>

11:26.041 --> 11:29.243
<i>Mr. McClaren, classified
information concerning United</i>

11:29.245 --> 11:32.146
<i>States military personnel was
recently stolen from the</i>

11:32.148 --> 11:34.682
<i>- Veterans Administration...
- And let me guess,</i>

11:34.684 --> 11:38.052
<i>you're here to ask me for
computer security tips.</i>

11:38.054 --> 11:39.620
<i>I'm here because the material</i>

11:39.622 --> 11:42.656
<i>was posted on your Web site.</i>

11:42.658 --> 11:45.292
<i>Uh, do you have a
question for my client?</i>

11:45.294 --> 11:48.896
<i>Mr. McClaren, are you aware...
that the unauthorized</i>

11:48.898 --> 11:50.664
<i>procurement and
dissemination of</i>

11:50.666 --> 11:52.266
<i>government medical
records is in</i>

11:52.268 --> 11:54.635
<i>direct violation of U.S.</i>

11:54.637 --> 11:58.606
<i>Military Code 14B7, Section 9?</i>

12:00.609 --> 12:04.278
<i>Are you charging
my client with a crime?</i>

12:04.280 --> 12:06.814
<i>That's an option.</i>

12:06.816 --> 12:10.284
<i>But right now, we are more interested
in who stole the information.</i>

12:10.286 --> 12:11.285
<i>Fuck you.</i>

12:11.287 --> 12:12.653
<i>I don't name names.</i>

12:12.655 --> 12:14.221
<i>Could you tell him, if he'd</i>

12:14.223 --> 12:18.859
<i>like to arrest me,
he should go ahead.</i>

12:22.964 --> 12:25.232
<i>We have mutual friends
in the D.A.'s Office.</i>

12:25.234 --> 12:27.234
<i>I only came down
here as a courtesy.</i>

12:27.236 --> 12:28.235
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

12:28.237 --> 12:30.404
<i>The department's
investigation intends to</i>

12:30.406 --> 12:33.841
<i>continue regardless of
Mr. McClaren's cooperation.</i>

12:33.843 --> 12:35.910
<i>Meaning...?</i>

12:38.546 --> 12:41.949
<i>I'll make it simple.</i>

12:41.951 --> 12:43.317
<i>Either you give
me your client's</i>

12:43.319 --> 12:47.454
<i>source or we'll
throw him in jail.</i>

12:49.557 --> 12:50.925
<i>I'm sure you wouldn't want that</i>

12:50.927 --> 12:54.228
<i>kind of publicity in the
middle of a trial.</i>

13:00.468 --> 13:02.536
<i>Chris told me that the... the</i>

<i>PTSD, you know,
back into combat</i>

13:07.043 --> 13:09.176
<i>on meds-- it just pissed me off.</i>

13:09.178 --> 13:10.177
<i>I understand.</i>

13:10.179 --> 13:11.412
<i>I mean, I know some of these</i>

13:11.414 --> 13:14.515
<i>guys, so I felt like, fuck it.</i>

13:14.517 --> 13:15.616
<i>You know, fuck that.</i>

13:15.618 --> 13:19.553
<i>The... rest of the world
should know about them, too.</i>

13:19.555 --> 13:20.721
<i>I'm sure Chris told</i>

13:20.723 --> 13:23.857
<i>you that I was approached by
the federal authorities.</i>

13:23.859 --> 13:26.126
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:26.128 --> 13:27.361
<i>They need to blame</i>

13:27.363 --> 13:29.964
<i>this on someone,
set an example,</i>

13:29.966 --> 13:32.466
<i>so they're going to
arrest McClaren.</i>

13:32.468 --> 13:36.103
<i>Unless I give myself up.</i>

13:36.105 --> 13:38.739
<i>As McClaren's lawyer,
it's my job to ask you</i>

13:38.741 --> 13:41.942
<i>if you'd be willing to do that.</i>

13:49.384 --> 13:52.786
<i>What-what would happen to
McClaren if he were arrested?</i>

13:52.788 --> 13:55.255
<i>The government will</i>
<i>do anything in its power to put</i>

13:55.257 --> 13:58.359
<i>McClaren out of business.</i>

13:58.361 --> 14:03.397
<i>And what would happen if...
if I turned myself in?</i>

14:03.399 --> 14:06.133
<i>Well, you're much</i>
<i>more sympathetic than McClaren.</i>

14:06.135 --> 14:08.902
<i>The military wouldn't go
after you in the same way.</i>

14:08.904 --> 14:11.238
<i>They'd look bad.</i>

14:11.240 --> 14:15.376
<i>Well, at the very</i>
<i>least, you'd be court-martialed.</i>

14:18.179 --> 14:21.215
<i>I mean, this is completely
up to you, Tony.</i>

14:21.217 --> 14:23.817
<i>It's got to be your decision.</i>

14:31.393 --> 14:32.659
<i>Yeah, I like McClaren.</i>

14:32.661 --> 14:35.029
<i>I like what he does.</i>

14:37.365 --> 14:38.732
<i>I mean, he... he gave me the</i>

14:38.734 --> 14:42.169
<i>opportunity to get
the story out.</i>

14:45.940 --> 14:47.975
<i>But I...</i>

14:50.612 --> 14:52.613
<i>I need to think about my future.</i>

14:53.682 --> 14:57.418
<i>My-my pension.</i>

14:57.420 --> 14:58.986
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

14:58.988 --> 15:01.655
<i>I-I just... I just can't do it.</i>

15:01.657 --> 15:05.526
<i>I just can't.</i>

15:05.528 --> 15:07.895
<i>I understand.</i>

15:09.931 --> 15:12.299
<i>Kate?</i>

15:12.301 --> 15:16.003
<i>Have you got the Naomi
Walling timeline?</i>

15:18.373 --> 15:20.407
<i>Kate?</i>

15:34.856 --> 15:38.092
<i>Is this what
you're looking for?</i>

15:45.834 --> 15:49.603
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:49.605 --> 15:50.904
<i>Thanks.</i>

15:50.906 --> 15:52.639
<i>Hey, that's it?</i>

15:52.641 --> 15:54.441
<i>You're not going to say hello?</i>

15:54.443 --> 15:58.078
<i>Oh, David, I'm in
the middle of this case.</i>

15:58.080 --> 15:59.746
<i>Okay.</i>

15:59.748 --> 16:03.250
<i>We'll catch up later.</i>

16:03.252 --> 16:06.353
<i>Wait.</i>

16:06.355 --> 16:08.422
<i>Wait. I'm sorry.</i>

16:11.392 --> 16:17.498
<i>So...
you've got a big decision to make.</i>

16:17.500 --> 16:19.566
<i>Yes.</i>

16:19.568 --> 16:22.469
<i>I like Chris.</i>

16:22.471 --> 16:23.871
<i>I do, too.</i>

16:23.873 --> 16:25.105
<i>Well, then, I guess</i>

16:25.107 --> 16:28.142
<i>you know what you have to do.</i>

16:30.211 --> 16:34.748
<i>I can't let
McClaren get arrested.</i>

16:34.750 --> 16:40.154
<i>I can't, not when I'm this
close to winning the case.</i>

16:40.156 --> 16:44.691
<i>Well...
then you're going to turn in the</i>

16:44.693 --> 16:47.728
<i>soldier who helped Chris?</i>

16:50.031 --> 16:55.035
<i>Chris won't
understand right now, but...</i>

16:55.037 --> 16:57.971
<i>in time, he will.</i>

16:57.973 --> 17:03.810
<i>I'll... find a way to make
things right somehow.</i>

17:03.812 --> 17:07.981
<i>You really believe that?</i>

17:07.983 --> 17:13.686
<i>You know...
I don't think that I ever really</i>

17:13.689 --> 17:16.656
<i>understood how important
it is to you.</i>

17:16.659 --> 17:19.626
<i>How important what is?</i>

17:19.627 --> 17:22.963
<i>Winning.</i>

17:22.964 --> 17:27.134
<i>You were going to be a doctor.</i>

17:27.136 --> 17:30.404
<i>You wanted success
as much as I did.</i>

17:30.406 --> 17:31.772
<i>No.</i>

17:31.774 --> 17:35.142
<i>I just wanted to be happy.</i>

17:35.144 --> 17:37.477
<i>There's a difference.</i>

17:48.156 --> 17:50.524
<i>I love you, Ellen.</i>

17:53.828 --> 17:57.531
<i>I love you, too.</i>

17:57.533 --> 18:02.836
<i>But after all this
time, I realize...</i>

18:02.838 --> 18:06.607
<i>we were never really
right for each other.</i>

18:12.180 --> 18:15.182
<i>Maybe you're right.</i>

18:19.153 --> 18:23.390
<i>When it comes to Chris,
whatever decision you</i>

18:23.392 --> 18:28.762
<i>make... just be sure
you can live with it.</i>

18:42.978 --> 18:45.445
<i>Miss Parsons?</i>

18:45.447 --> 18:49.516
<i>- I'm sorry. I was knocking...
- I'm sorry.</i>

18:49.518 --> 18:51.184
<i>Please, uh, come in.</i>

18:51.186 --> 18:53.887
<i>Have a seat.</i>

18:53.889 --> 18:57.824
<i>Have you made a decision?</i>

18:57.826 --> 19:01.094
<i>Yes, I have.</i>

19:06.001 --> 19:08.035
<i>You have the right to
speak to an attorney.</i>

19:08.037 --> 19:09.469
<i>You're aware of that?</i>

19:09.471 --> 19:12.105
<i>I don't need an attorney.</i>

19:23.885 --> 19:26.353
<i>Thank you for meeting with me.</i>

19:26.355 --> 19:29.022
<i>What do you
want with me, Mr. Simon?</i>

19:29.024 --> 19:31.358
<i>I have a proposal for you.</i>

19:31.360 --> 19:33.860
<i>I want to get rid of
Channing McClaren.</i>

19:33.862 --> 19:36.963
<i>Mr. Simon is
going to delay the leak.</i>

19:36.965 --> 19:38.198
<i>I'll have time to start an</i>

19:38.200 --> 19:41.835
<i>internal investigation, then
hand it over to the SEC.</i>

19:41.837 --> 19:43.136
<i>But first, I need you</i>

19:43.138 --> 19:46.373
<i>to get me personal information
on Naomi Walling.</i>

19:46.375 --> 19:48.375
<i>What kind of information?</i>

19:48.377 --> 19:52.145
<i>Disparaging-- something
she wouldn't want public.</i>

19:52.147 --> 19:54.181
<i>I see.</i>

19:56.617 --> 20:00.887
<i>You were right--
Walling was a busy little lady.</i>

20:00.889 --> 20:02.856
<i>I got over a thousand e-mails,</i>

20:02.858 --> 20:05.425
<i>distinctly sexual in nature.</i>

20:05.427 --> 20:07.527
<i>Any e-mails to</i>
<i>and from me must be left out.</i>

20:07.529 --> 20:11.198
<i>What about her
correspondence with Mr. Herreshoff?</i>

20:11.200 --> 20:14.868
<i>You don't
have to worry about that.</i>

20:17.071 --> 20:19.806
<i>Pleasure to
meet you, Mr. Simon.</i>

20:19.808 --> 20:23.677
<i>This should do everything
we need it to.</i>

20:29.517 --> 20:31.551
<i>You guaranteed my anonymity.</i>

20:31.553 --> 20:34.488
<i>I'm really very
sorry, Mrs. Walling.</i>

20:34.490 --> 20:35.489
<i>Sorry?</i>

20:35.491 --> 20:36.623
<i>It was a mistake.</i>

20:36.625 --> 20:38.892
<i>How did you get
my personal e-mails?</i>

20:38.894 --> 20:41.395
<i>Well, you must have</i>
<i>accidentally sent them to us.</i>

20:41.397 --> 20:43.530
<i>Bullshit.</i>

20:43.532 --> 20:46.967
<i>You hacked into Princefield's
system and stole them.</i>

20:46.969 --> 20:49.870
<i>That is an
outrageous accusation.</i>

20:49.872 --> 20:53.707
<i>Bennett Herreshoff struck
some kind of a deal with you.</i>

20:53.709 --> 20:55.709
<i>You're way off
base, Ms. Walling.</i>

20:55.711 --> 20:58.745
<i>Somehow, he got
to you or to Channing.</i>

20:58.747 --> 21:02.449
<i>Either way, you're
all going to pay.</i>

21:02.451 --> 21:06.887
<i>Set me up for life, or I'll
bring down Princefield,</i>

21:06.889 --> 21:12.159
<i>Herreshoff, McClaren...
every fucking one of you.</i>

21:15.263 --> 21:20.033
<i>I don't have much time.</i>

21:20.035 --> 21:23.570
<i>So... what can I do for you?</i>

21:25.973 --> 21:29.109
<i>I have an additional
witness to add to my list.</i>

21:29.111 --> 21:31.445
<i>I'll be submitting this
officially this week,</i>

21:31.447 --> 21:36.316
<i>but I thought I'd
give you a heads-up.</i>

21:47.295 --> 21:49.596
<i>Have a good night.</i>

22:31.305 --> 22:32.839
<i>Really, Ms. Parsons,</i>

22:32.841 --> 22:36.710
<i>I don't see what business
we have with each other.</i>

22:36.712 --> 22:38.979
<i>I give money to McClarenTruth,</i>

22:38.981 --> 22:40.514
<i>you defend them in court.</i>

22:40.516 --> 22:42.549
<i>So do your job.</i>

22:42.551 --> 22:46.086
<i>Defend them and leave me alone.</i>

22:46.088 --> 22:49.789
<i>How well do you
know Rutger Simon?</i>

22:49.791 --> 22:52.425
<i>McClaren's nursemaid?</i>

22:53.862 --> 22:55.695
<i>Why?</i>

22:55.697 --> 23:01.568
<i>Mr. Simon
has switched sides.</i>

23:01.570 --> 23:03.603
<i>Explain.</i>

23:03.605 --> 23:05.939
<i>He's testifying
for Patty Hewes.</i>

23:05.941 --> 23:08.375
<i>Against Channing McClaren.</i>

23:08.377 --> 23:09.976
<i>How do we know this?</i>

23:09.978 --> 23:14.681
<i>Patty's going to
submit him as a witness.</i>

23:14.683 --> 23:20.887
<i>If this is true,
you will lose the case.</i>

23:20.889 --> 23:25.392
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

23:25.394 --> 23:27.894
<i>But we're here to talk about</i>

23:27.896 --> 23:30.564
<i>what you're going to lose.</i>

23:32.767 --> 23:34.668
<i>Talk.</i>

23:34.670 --> 23:36.202
<i>I don't know what</i>

23:36.204 --> 23:40.874
<i>your involvement in this
really is, Mr. Torben...</i>

23:40.876 --> 23:44.110
<i>but I believe Mr. Simon does.</i>

23:44.112 --> 23:49.115
<i>What are
you implying, Ms. Parsons?</i>

23:49.117 --> 23:54.421
<i>I don't care what you and
Bennett Herreshoff are up to.</i>

23:54.423 --> 23:58.124
<i>All I care about is my case.</i>

23:58.126 --> 24:02.295
<i>Rutger Simon is in Patty
Hewes' hands now.</i>

24:02.297 --> 24:04.364
<i>And when she uses him against</i>

24:04.366 --> 24:07.767
<i>you-- and believe
me, she will--</i>

24:07.769 --> 24:10.537
<i>you and your CEO friend are</i>

24:10.539 --> 24:13.440
<i>going to be neck-deep in shit.</i>

24:15.242 --> 24:17.410
<i>Indeed.</i>

24:30.224 --> 24:35.695
<i>You're all going to</i>
<i>pay, every fucking one of you.</i>

24:38.099 --> 24:39.799
<i>What is this?</i>

24:39.801 --> 24:43.103
<i>The figure Naomi
Walling wants to be paid to</i>

24:43.105 --> 24:45.705
<i>keep her mouth shut.</i>

24:47.775 --> 24:49.976
<i>Explain.</i>

24:49.978 --> 24:53.680
<i>She had an affair
with Herreshoff.</i>

24:53.682 --> 24:56.383
<i>None of his e-mails to
her were in the leak.</i>

24:56.385 --> 24:58.985
<i>She put two and two together.</i>

24:58.987 --> 25:03.490
<i>Men and their fucking genitals.</i>

25:08.963 --> 25:10.897
<i>All right.</i>

25:10.899 --> 25:12.899
<i>We pay her.</i>

25:16.470 --> 25:18.038
<i>Wait.</i>

25:18.040 --> 25:21.074
<i>Naomi Walling is a
whistle-blower.</i>

25:21.076 --> 25:23.810
<i>Whistle-blowers like to
talk, to betray secrets.</i>

25:23.812 --> 25:26.613
<i>It makes them feel good
about themselves.</i>

25:26.615 --> 25:31.251
<i>They don't...
they don't do it for the money.</i>

25:31.253 --> 25:33.553
<i>When she feels like starting to</i>

25:33.555 --> 25:39.993
<i>talk again, she could use
the payoff against us.</i>

25:39.995 --> 25:45.365
<i>What are you suggesting?</i>

25:45.367 --> 25:47.901
<i>I don't know.</i>

25:47.903 --> 25:50.437
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

27:47.956 --> 27:50.690
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

27:50.692 --> 27:54.627
<i>Mr. Simon has been
talking to Patty Hewes.</i>

27:54.629 --> 27:55.795
<i>That's right.</i>

27:55.797 --> 27:59.232
<i>I want to testify against
Channing, get this done with</i>

27:59.234 --> 28:01.201
<i>once and for all.</i>

28:01.203 --> 28:03.603
<i>It will be better
for all of us.</i>

28:03.605 --> 28:06.406
<i>Should have done it sooner.</i>

28:10.077 --> 28:11.277
<i>And what did you</i>

28:11.279 --> 28:14.080
<i>tell Ms. Hewes about
me and Mr. Torben?</i>

28:14.082 --> 28:16.449
<i>Well, nothing, of course.</i>

28:16.451 --> 28:20.787
<i>I'm relying on you for funding
once this trial's over.</i>

28:23.257 --> 28:26.826
<i>You are aware Patty
Hewes despises Wall Street.</i>

28:26.828 --> 28:27.894
<i>You really think she won't</i>

28:27.896 --> 28:30.396
<i>pursue us once she
takes down McClaren?</i>

28:30.398 --> 28:32.398
<i>Her case isn't against you.</i>

28:32.400 --> 28:34.400
<i>She's fighting some
personal war.</i>

28:34.402 --> 28:36.803
<i>All she cares about is
beating Ellen Parsons.</i>

28:36.805 --> 28:44.744
<i>Regardless, we can't have
you getting cozy with Ms. Hewes.</i>

28:44.746 --> 28:46.646
<i>Of course.</i>

28:46.648 --> 28:49.816
<i>I have no reason to
turn against you.</i>

28:49.818 --> 28:54.220
<i>A simple slip of the
tongue would be enough.</i>

28:54.222 --> 28:56.222
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

28:56.224 --> 29:00.593
<i>I can handle myself
with Patty Hewes.</i>

29:06.033 --> 29:11.004
<i>All right, Mr
. Simon, go ahead and testify.</i>

29:28.856 --> 29:31.524
<i>Nothing to Heathrow, London?</i>

29:31.526 --> 29:34.560
<i>No, I can't...
can't fly standby.</i>

29:34.562 --> 29:35.828
<i>What about, uh, Dublin?</i>

29:35.830 --> 29:37.130
<i>Yeah, great.</i>

29:37.132 --> 29:39.499
<i>I'll take the morning flight.</i>

29:39.501 --> 29:41.200
<i>All rise.</i>

29:42.846 --> 29:44.767
<i>In the matter of Walling Vs.</i>

29:44.884 --> 29:48.701
<i>McClaren,</i> the honorable
Justice Richard Gearheart presiding.

29:49.061 --> 29:50.009
Be seated, everyone.

29:50.011 --> 29:52.178
Counsel are present, Your Honor.

29:52.180 --> 29:53.346
Excellent.

29:53.348 --> 29:56.049
Ms. Hewes, are you ready
for opening arguments?

29:56.051 --> 29:57.250
I am, Your Honor.

29:57.252 --> 29:59.652
The floor is yours.

30:12.833 --> 30:14.867
Your Honor.

30:14.869 --> 30:16.736
Yes, Ms. Hewes.

30:16.738 --> 30:21.040
I need a moment to
consult with my client.

30:21.042 --> 30:23.576
Make it quick.

30:32.954 --> 30:37.724
Your Honor, may we approach?

30:44.932 --> 30:48.568
Your Honor, it has just been
brought to my attention that

30:48.570 --> 30:52.305
Rutger Simon has left the
country, so my most important

30:52.307 --> 30:58.811
witness will no longer be
testifying on my client's behalf.

30:58.813 --> 31:03.583
In light of this, my client and
I feel that we have no choice

31:03.585 --> 31:05.985
but to withdraw our
suit at this time.

31:05.987 --> 31:08.287
You're dropping
all of your claims?

31:08.289 --> 31:12.325
Reluctantly, yes.

31:12.327 --> 31:17.864
Your Honor, I...
I simply have no case.

31:17.866 --> 31:20.366
- Mr. McClaren...
- Mr. McClaren, Mr. McClaren,

31:20.368 --> 31:23.469
what does this outcome signal for
the future of McClarenTruth.org?

31:23.471 --> 31:26.305
McClarenTruth will
continue to expose injustice.

31:26.307 --> 31:28.541
And that's a very
good thing for the world, but

31:28.543 --> 31:31.544
today is not a
celebration for us.

31:31.546 --> 31:34.147
Naomi Walling's death was a
tragedy regardless of the

31:34.149 --> 31:35.815
outcome of this case.

31:35.817 --> 31:38.618
She was a courageous whistle
blower, and we won't forget her.

31:38.620 --> 31:40.653
That being said, what happened
here today only goes to prove

31:40.655 --> 31:43.623
that this lawsuit should never have
been filed in the first place.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.625
Is that a direct
shot at Patty Hewes?

31:45.627 --> 31:46.626
It's a fact.

31:46.628 --> 31:47.627
Thank you.

31:47.629 --> 31:50.663
- Ms. Parsons, if I could just...
- We'll be holding a

31:50.665 --> 31:52.632
formal press conference
later today.

31:52.634 --> 31:53.633
Thank you. Thank you so much.

31:53.635 --> 31:54.634
Thank you.

31:54.636 --> 31:55.743
Channing...

32:31.908 --> 32:35.475
I still can't believe
that you beat Patty Hewes.

32:35.477 --> 32:36.776
Wow.

32:40.482 --> 32:44.217
I'm very grateful
for your help, Kate.

32:44.219 --> 32:49.856
So you really don't know why
Rutger Simon decided not to testify?

32:49.858 --> 32:54.393
Truly, I have no idea.

32:54.395 --> 32:58.498
Well, clients are going
to be banging down the doors.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.100
I don't know how you're going
to choose your next case.

33:01.102 --> 33:04.770
Well, we can decide next week.

33:04.772 --> 33:08.407
Michael's custody trial is
starting, so you could take the

33:08.409 --> 33:11.544
next few days off if you want.

33:11.546 --> 33:15.948
Ellen, whatever
resolution you're looking for

33:15.950 --> 33:21.587
with Patty, I hope this custody
case helps you sort it out.

33:24.558 --> 33:27.360
It will.

33:27.362 --> 33:28.828
Good night.

33:28.830 --> 33:30.997
Good night.

33:34.702 --> 33:37.069
What do you say to the
accusations that you should

33:37.071 --> 33:39.238
never have filed this suit?

33:39.240 --> 33:41.174
I failed today.

33:41.176 --> 33:44.911
I was unable to get
justice for my client.

33:44.913 --> 33:47.046
I will live with the
burden of that failure.

33:47.048 --> 33:48.047
Thank you for your time.

33:48.049 --> 33:50.049
I've booked us
tickets to Budapest.

33:50.051 --> 33:52.251
The team's on the last
flight out tonight.

33:52.253 --> 33:56.055
Have you heard from Rutger?

33:56.057 --> 33:57.557
No.

33:57.559 --> 33:58.558
He's gone, Channing.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.761
He turned on us and ran like
the fucking coward he is.

34:01.763 --> 34:04.630
We'll have no problem finding
a replacement for him.

34:04.632 --> 34:08.534
Yes, we will.

34:08.536 --> 34:11.571
Channing, you're free.

34:11.572 --> 34:13.072
The lawsuit's over.

34:13.074 --> 34:14.139
Be happy.

34:14.141 --> 34:16.809
There will be other lawsuits.

34:16.811 --> 34:20.279
Governments, media.

34:20.281 --> 34:23.216
I'll always be under attack.

34:26.887 --> 34:31.123
Maybe because you're a hero.

34:33.726 --> 34:35.460
Come on.

34:35.463 --> 34:37.964
Car to the airport's outside.

34:40.199 --> 34:46.304
Why do people hate you
so much when you tell the truth?

35:07.961 --> 35:10.196
Detective, I don't know
what you're hoping to learn

35:10.198 --> 35:12.965
from me, but I'm supposed to
be in court right about now.

35:12.967 --> 35:14.300
We know.

35:14.302 --> 35:16.836
Ellen Parsons was scheduled
to testify against you today.

35:16.838 --> 35:20.172
Know what she was going
to say on the stand?

35:20.174 --> 35:22.975
No.

35:22.977 --> 35:30.483
And if she's missing, I guess we'll
never get a chance to find out.

35:56.677 --> 35:59.045
What are you doing here?

35:59.047 --> 36:02.515
You moved your stuff out.

36:02.517 --> 36:06.118
Yeah, you noticed?

36:06.120 --> 36:11.457
Chris, look, I'm
sorry, but it had to be done.

36:11.459 --> 36:15.594
It had to be done?

36:15.596 --> 36:19.198
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:19.200 --> 36:22.802
The guy tried to help me out,
and you fucked him over, Ellen.

36:22.804 --> 36:25.805
When he gave you that information,
he knew he was taking a risk.

36:25.807 --> 36:27.807
I asked him to take that risk!

36:27.809 --> 36:28.808
I know.

36:28.810 --> 36:30.810
I asked him to do it.

36:30.812 --> 36:32.845
Look, obviously, I
understand why you're angry--

36:32.847 --> 36:33.813
I do-- but McClaren's my client.

36:33.815 --> 36:35.815
It's my job to protect him.
That's what lawyers do.

36:35.817 --> 36:37.817
You don't give
a shit about McClaren.

36:37.819 --> 36:39.819
You just want to win.
That's all you care about.

36:39.821 --> 36:41.821
No, it's more
complicated than that.

36:41.823 --> 36:42.822
No, it isn't.

36:42.824 --> 36:44.824
Chris, please understand.

36:44.826 --> 36:46.826
You put the
case ahead of me, okay?

36:46.828 --> 36:48.828
You put the case
ahead of me, Ellen!

36:48.830 --> 36:52.465
Yes, I did, and
yes, I care about winning.

36:52.467 --> 36:55.334
Of course, I care.

36:55.336 --> 36:57.036
I've devoted my life to this.

36:57.038 --> 36:59.805
It matters to me.

37:04.010 --> 37:07.279
But so do you.

37:07.281 --> 37:10.983
And I promise you, I will
make this up to you.

37:10.985 --> 37:14.887
How the fuck do you
think you're going to do that?

37:14.889 --> 37:18.958
I'll make things right.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.260
There's always a way.

37:21.262 --> 37:26.832
Yeah, I'd love to believe that.

37:26.834 --> 37:29.168
But I don't.

37:48.356 --> 37:50.456
I met with Scully.

37:50.458 --> 37:53.459
He admitted Patty Hewes hired
him to come after me, and he's

37:53.461 --> 37:55.294
willing to testify against her.

37:55.296 --> 37:57.797
How'd you get
him to agree to that?

37:57.799 --> 38:01.600
Pulled some strings in the D.A.'s
office, made a deal for his immunity.

38:01.602 --> 38:03.602
Why didn't
you just turn him in?

38:03.604 --> 38:05.671
I don't want him
to get arrested yet.

38:05.673 --> 38:08.340
I need him to get
more on Patty.

38:08.342 --> 38:10.509
But you understand that
you're taking a big risk

38:10.511 --> 38:12.678
with this guy out there.

38:12.680 --> 38:15.181
I have personal
reasons for doing it this way.

38:15.183 --> 38:17.183
What about Patty Hewes?

38:17.185 --> 38:20.252
How do you know she's not going to
use Scully to go after you again?

38:20.254 --> 38:22.254
I'll take care of Ellen.

38:22.256 --> 38:27.626
If there's any sign of trouble,
detectives, I'll reach out to you.

38:40.674 --> 38:43.676
Ms. Hewes.

38:43.678 --> 38:46.212
I was very close with
your Uncle Pete.

38:46.214 --> 38:49.949
Yes, you mentioned
that on the phone.

38:49.951 --> 38:56.455
We've never met before,
but I feel like I know you.

38:56.457 --> 38:59.892
I used to work for
you after all.

38:59.894 --> 39:03.262
You never worked for me.

39:03.264 --> 39:09.835
I sure as hell got
paid to do things for you.

39:09.837 --> 39:13.405
Corey, come.

39:13.407 --> 39:19.411
Ellen Parsons
knows all about me.

39:19.413 --> 39:21.280
How?

39:21.282 --> 39:26.919
She had this on
her when I attacked her.

39:26.921 --> 39:29.455
She had the blood on it tested.

39:29.457 --> 39:32.324
Led her straight to me.

39:36.930 --> 39:41.734
Parsons got the D .A.'s office to grant
me immunity if I testify against you.

39:41.736 --> 39:49.074
How much would it cost
me to avoid that scenario?

39:49.076 --> 39:57.316
Enough to set
my family up for a long... long time.

39:58.386 --> 40:01.654
I'm sure it's hard
to hear that your mother is

40:01.656 --> 40:07.626
capable of doing such a thing...
but it's true.

40:07.628 --> 40:09.662
Are you sure?

40:09.664 --> 40:12.698
Yeah.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.535
I also have documentation of the
wire transfer from Patty to

40:16.537 --> 40:22.775
Patrick Scully made shortly
after this conversation.

40:22.777 --> 40:27.580
I want to use this evidence
in your custody trial.

40:27.582 --> 40:31.684
But, obviously, I
need your okay first.

40:31.686 --> 40:34.520
That's fine by me.

40:41.121 --> 40:41.827
It's a slam dunk now.

40:41.829 --> 40:43.729
I'll get my daughter.

40:43.731 --> 40:46.799
Yes, you will.

40:49.269 --> 40:53.539
- Still...
- What?

40:53.541 --> 41:02.815
It just feels like she
hasn't been hurt enough... somehow.

41:02.817 --> 41:06.885
You know?

41:14.427 --> 41:19.498
I'd like a moment
with my father, please.

41:51.364 --> 41:55.300
So you're still alive.

42:06.546 --> 42:11.583
I've been thinking
about forgiveness.

42:15.855 --> 42:18.957
What about my land?

42:24.698 --> 42:30.469
As soon as you draw your last breath,
I'm going to sell it to the lowest bidder.

42:30.471 --> 42:35.541
The first person who wants
to pay a penny can have it.

42:35.543 --> 42:37.443
That's right.

42:37.445 --> 42:41.480
You hold tight to that hatred.

42:41.482 --> 42:45.617
It's all you got.

42:45.619 --> 42:48.487
It's all I need.

42:51.391 --> 42:52.524
I made you tough.

42:54.361 --> 42:58.063
You are what you
are 'cause of me.

42:58.065 --> 43:04.737
I am who I am despite you.

43:09.709 --> 43:11.744
I'm sorry.

43:11.746 --> 43:16.281
It's too late.

43:19.486 --> 43:26.492
You did everything you
could to crush me.

43:31.164 --> 43:36.401
My mother would go to
church and pray for you.

43:36.403 --> 43:41.774
And I never understood why,
because I thought that you

43:41.776 --> 43:44.943
deserved to go to hell...

43:47.914 --> 43:58.190
...for your cruelty...
your brutality.

43:58.192 --> 44:04.363
For every night you came
home in a drunken rage.

44:04.365 --> 44:12.337
You... terrorized us.

44:12.339 --> 44:15.207
You bullied us.

44:15.209 --> 44:23.182
And our fear made you
feel big and important.

44:25.652 --> 44:29.822
Mama... never judged you.

44:33.326 --> 44:37.362
But I will.

44:39.332 --> 44:44.870
I want you to remember
this moment forever.

44:46.139 --> 44:50.742
This feeling of
helplessness, of weakness.

44:50.744 --> 45:00.419
Of me looking you in the eyes and
telling you how much I hate you.

45:00.421 --> 45:06.859
There's no forgiveness
for you, no mercy.

45:09.462 --> 45:13.565
Only death.

45:18.104 --> 45:20.839
I'm going to tell you a secret.

45:20.841 --> 45:22.541
Can you keep a secret?

45:22.543 --> 45:25.544
Yes.

45:25.546 --> 45:27.846
I'm Grandma's son.

45:27.848 --> 45:29.114
Really?

45:29.116 --> 45:31.450
Mm-hmm.

45:31.452 --> 45:39.424
So I guess that means
that we're related.

45:39.426 --> 45:42.928
Catherine?

45:42.930 --> 45:45.831
I need to speak to
Michael for a minute.

45:45.833 --> 45:48.400
So can you keep coloring?

45:48.402 --> 45:49.401
Okay.

45:49.403 --> 45:53.472
Good girl.

46:03.216 --> 46:04.917
She's sweet.

46:04.919 --> 46:08.620
Yes, she is.

46:08.622 --> 46:11.623
I thought it was time
you met her properly.

46:11.625 --> 46:14.326
But you don't want
her to know I'm her father.

46:14.328 --> 46:15.327
Not yet.

46:15.329 --> 46:18.297
I think we need to come
to an understanding.

46:18.299 --> 46:22.134
Well, that's what
the custody trial is for.

46:22.136 --> 46:25.470
I'm not interested in your
one-sided negotiations.

46:25.472 --> 46:27.706
I just want what's fair.

46:27.708 --> 46:29.041
And what's that?

46:29.043 --> 46:31.677
Shared custody, 50-50.

46:31.679 --> 46:34.813
How is that fair exactly?

46:34.815 --> 46:38.884
She's my daughter.

46:41.454 --> 46:45.891
Because of me...
Catherine will never know what

46:45.893 --> 46:47.793
it feels like to be abandoned.

46:47.795 --> 46:48.794
That's bullshit.

46:48.796 --> 46:52.030
This is about Ellen Parsons and
what she's going to say in court.

46:52.032 --> 46:55.834
I don't care what
Ellen testifies to.

46:55.836 --> 46:58.870
All she has is
slander and lies.

47:03.310 --> 47:05.110
Okay, Mom.

47:05.112 --> 47:08.280
We'll see.

47:10.650 --> 47:13.118
Michael.

47:15.388 --> 47:19.558
Can't we meet each
other halfway?

47:21.094 --> 47:27.265
Let's let a
judge decide this one.

47:49.122 --> 47:51.189
Do you want one?

47:51.191 --> 47:52.190
Bagels.

47:52.192 --> 47:53.392
Yeah, all right, all right.

47:54.395 --> 47:55.394
It's Michael.

47:56.397 --> 47:57.396
Michael, it's Ellen.

47:57.398 --> 48:01.900
Scully's all set to testify, so head to
my office, and we'll leave from there.

48:28.362 --> 48:31.263
Ellen was supposed
to be here two hours ago.

48:31.265 --> 48:33.432
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

48:35.369 --> 48:37.502
Parsons is my
ticket to immunity.

48:37.504 --> 48:39.938
I... I'm worried.

48:39.940 --> 48:42.307
Something's happened to her.

48:42.309 --> 48:44.142
Like what?

48:44.144 --> 48:47.512
Do you really think that
Patty Hewes is going to let

48:47.514 --> 48:48.980
this custody hearing go through?

48:48.982 --> 48:51.850
You know I used to work
for Patty's uncle, right?

48:51.852 --> 48:53.885
That woman is crazy.

48:53.887 --> 48:57.255
I once had to kill a fucking
dog just to get her a witness.

48:57.257 --> 48:59.925
When I met her, I saw
how desperate she was.

48:59.927 --> 49:01.026
Trust me.

49:01.028 --> 49:05.697
There's a reason Ellen Parsons
isn't here right now.

49:22.049 --> 49:23.415
Ortiz.

49:23.417 --> 49:26.952
Yeah, this is Waleed Cooper,
Ellen Parsons' investigator.

49:26.954 --> 49:28.220
How can I help you?

49:28.222 --> 49:31.857
I was supposed to meet
Ellen at her office two hours ago.

49:31.859 --> 49:33.091
She hasn't shown up.

49:33.093 --> 49:36.795
What would you like us to do?

49:39.832 --> 49:41.199
Williams.

50:19.071 --> 50:21.072
Miss Hewes.

50:21.074 --> 50:23.308
Ellen Parsons is missing.

50:25.311 --> 50:26.545
Oh?

50:26.547 --> 50:29.080
Ellen, where the hell are you?

50:29.082 --> 50:32.150
I need to know
you're all right.

50:37.390 --> 50:40.192
Hey.

50:40.194 --> 50:44.095
Let's check the roof.

50:44.097 --> 50:46.565
Detective, I don't know
what you're hoping to learn

50:46.567 --> 50:49.901
from me, but I'm supposed to
be in court right about now.

50:49.903 --> 50:51.436
We know.

50:51.438 --> 50:55.207
Ellen Parsons was scheduled
to testify against you today.

50:55.209 --> 50:58.109
I can't imagine you were
too pleased about that.

50:58.111 --> 51:02.647
Know what she was going
to say on the stand?

51:02.649 --> 51:05.550
No.

51:05.552 --> 51:12.557
And if she's missing...
I guess we'll never get a chance to find out.

51:24.370 --> 51:26.271
Ellen?

51:26.273 --> 51:29.007
Is anybody here?

51:32.378 --> 51:34.546
Call her again.

51:34.548 --> 51:35.747
Why?

51:35.749 --> 51:38.250
Just do it.

52:05.444 --> 52:07.479
Shit.

52:21.061 --> 52:23.061
It's Michael.

52:24.064 --> 52:25.063
Michael, it's Ellen.

52:25.065 --> 52:27.565
Scully's all set to testify, so
head to my office and we'll

52:27.567 --> 52:29.601
leave from there.

52:40.046 --> 52:42.647
The most
important thing is rest.

52:42.649 --> 52:45.450
Well, I have the trial
coming up, but once that's

52:45.452 --> 52:47.419
over, I'll be able
to take it easy.

52:47.421 --> 52:49.788
I'm afraid that may be too late.

52:49.790 --> 52:52.490
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

52:52.492 --> 52:57.128
The dizziness, the irregular bleeding...
I don't like the direction

52:57.130 --> 52:59.164
you're heading.

53:03.169 --> 53:06.705
I don't want you
to lose this baby.

53:12.545 --> 53:15.013
Do you?

53:15.015 --> 53:19.818
Because that could happen
if you keep up this pace.

53:41.775 --> 53:43.241
Ellen?

53:45.579 --> 53:48.012
There's a woman unconscious.

53:48.014 --> 53:51.049
Send an ambulance to the corner
of Canal and Greene. Hurry!

53:51.051 --> 53:54.119
Ellen, Ellen, can you hear me?

53:58.892 --> 54:01.860
Ellen?

54:01.862 --> 54:03.928
Is that you?

54:12.872 --> 54:16.808
So you're Patrick Scully.

54:16.810 --> 54:18.877
Yeah.

54:22.248 --> 54:26.184
Thank you for,
uh, testifying for me.

54:29.188 --> 54:31.623
I've been trying to
reach Ellen for hours.

54:31.625 --> 54:32.624
Do you know where she is?

54:32.626 --> 54:35.760
She's outside
dying in an alley.

54:35.762 --> 54:37.729
Ellen.

54:37.731 --> 54:40.064
Ellen, Ellen, can you hear me?

54:40.066 --> 54:41.633
Ellen!

54:41.635 --> 54:43.968
Give my best to your mother.

54:43.970 --> 54:44.969
Well, hold on.

54:44.971 --> 54:46.638
Where... where are you going?

54:46.640 --> 54:49.107
Ellen got me immunity.

54:49.109 --> 54:52.410
Without her, I've got
no reason to testify.

54:52.412 --> 54:55.480
No one else can I.D. me.

54:58.584 --> 55:01.152
I can.

55:01.154 --> 55:04.222
I know what you did.

55:08.294 --> 55:12.730
The night Ellen was
attacked, I saw you.

55:12.732 --> 55:14.065
Shit!

55:16.036 --> 55:20.605
If anyone asks, I wasn't here.

55:20.607 --> 55:27.645
I told my mother I was out of town, but
I lied-- I saw you at the building.

55:27.647 --> 55:30.715
You were talking to Uncle Pete.

55:48.868 --> 55:53.605
If you don't testify against
my mother, I'll turn you in.

55:56.775 --> 55:59.110
Ellen.

56:11.490 --> 56:13.725
Ellen, can you hear me?

56:13.727 --> 56:15.426
Ellen!

56:15.428 --> 56:17.428
Come on. Come on.

56:17.430 --> 56:19.497
Look at me. Look at me.

56:19.499 --> 56:22.934
Ellen, Ellen, look at me.

56:22.936 --> 56:23.968
That's it.

56:23.970 --> 56:24.969
Come on.

56:24.971 --> 56:27.639
Let's get you into your office.

56:42.521 --> 56:46.491
Can you call the detectives?

56:48.828 --> 56:50.895
Ortiz.

56:59.438 --> 57:01.639
Turn the speaker off.

59:55.614 --> 59:58.816
I'm sorry for your loss, Patty.

01:00:04.723 --> 01:00:07.225
Michael would still be
alive if you hadn't brought

01:00:07.227 --> 01:00:10.695
Scully into the custody case.

01:00:10.697 --> 01:00:13.064
Scully tried to kill me.

01:00:13.066 --> 01:00:15.099
You hired him to do it.

01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:17.101
Now, we've discussed this.

01:00:17.103 --> 01:00:20.838
Yes, but now I can
prove everything I've said.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.842
It's all in this briefcase.

01:00:24.844 --> 01:00:27.178
Scully's DNA.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:32.283
The bank transfer you
made to buy his silence.

01:00:32.285 --> 01:00:37.688
I could have you arrested
for attempted murder.

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:42.527
But prison couldn't possibly
be worse than losing a child.

01:00:46.365 --> 01:00:52.904
I guess we both have plenty
of blood on our hands, don't we?

01:00:52.906 --> 01:00:55.558
I hope you realize by now...

01:00:56.859 --> 01:01:00.743
winning the McClaren case
meant nothing to me, Ellen.

01:01:01.347 --> 01:01:05.183
I just wanted to see what
you're really made of.

01:01:07.886 --> 01:01:10.188
What are you talking about?

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:12.957
I told you Mr. Simon was
going to be a witness for

01:01:12.959 --> 01:01:16.527
me because I wanted to
see what you would do.

01:01:16.529 --> 01:01:18.930
And you played it perfectly.

01:01:21.533 --> 01:01:27.738
You and your CEO friend
are going to be neck-deep in shit.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.875
Indeed.

01:01:30.877 --> 01:01:33.511
If you want to
protect yourself against

01:01:33.513 --> 01:01:40.051
Mr. Simon... the time to act is now.

01:01:44.223 --> 01:01:48.759
Am I making myself clear?

01:01:48.761 --> 01:01:51.162
Quite clear.

01:01:53.832 --> 01:01:57.501
You didn't care what they did.

01:01:57.503 --> 01:02:04.108
And now Rutger Simon
is dead, Ellen.

01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:07.078
Nothing to Heathrow, London?

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.814
No, I can't...
can't fly standby.

01:02:09.816 --> 01:02:11.883
What about, uh, Dublin?

01:02:11.885 --> 01:02:15.152
Yeah, great, I'll take
the morning flight.

01:02:57.462 --> 01:02:59.630
Congratulations.

01:02:59.632 --> 01:03:02.833
You won the case, Ellen.

01:03:02.835 --> 01:03:05.903
You did what it
took to beat me.

01:03:29.895 --> 01:03:33.164
You're finally in
the game, Ellen.

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:37.702
I look forward to going up
against you again someday.

01:04:27.552 --> 01:04:29.487
Thank you.

01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:47.371
Honey, come stand by Mommy.

01:04:59.851 --> 01:05:01.819
Can I help you?

01:05:01.821 --> 01:05:04.188
Name is Hewes.

01:05:07.626 --> 01:05:09.794
Take me home.

01:05:24.443 --> 01:05:27.945
Hello, Patty.

01:05:27.947 --> 01:05:30.014
Hello.

01:05:32.317 --> 01:05:40.724
- I just... I wanted...
- Yes?

01:05:44.763 --> 01:05:50.367
...to
finally thank you.

01:05:50.369 --> 01:05:55.072
I'm really grateful.

01:05:55.074 --> 01:05:57.441
For everything.

01:06:00.879 --> 01:06:03.414
You're welcome, Ellen.

01:06:05.417 --> 01:06:10.321
And I wanted you
to meet my daughter.

01:06:10.323 --> 01:06:12.556
Hello.

01:06:33.145 --> 01:06:36.280
Ms. Hewes?

01:06:36.282 --> 01:06:39.350
Everything okay back there?

01:06:53.031 --> 01:06:56.667
Just one more second, sweetie.

01:06:59.037 --> 01:07:01.071
I've changed my mind.

01:07:01.073 --> 01:07:05.142
Take me to the office.

01:07:12.584 --> 01:07:15.619
Do you know that lady in there?

01:07:15.621 --> 01:07:17.788
I used to.

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:19.857
Before you were born.

01:07:19.859 --> 01:07:21.492
When I was a lawyer.

01:07:21.494 --> 01:07:26.697
But you don't do that anymore.

01:07:26.699 --> 01:07:28.999
No, I don't.

01:07:35.207 --> 01:07:37.508
Should we go find Daddy?

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.743
He's at the V.A. today.

01:07:39.745 --> 01:07:41.812
Okay.

01:07:48.086 --> 01:07:52.923
There's just a little
dust right here.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.568
It's such a wee flower!
