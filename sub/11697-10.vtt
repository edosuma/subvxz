WEBVTT

00:04.363 --> 00:06.231
I can't believe this day
is finally here.

00:06.265 --> 00:07.599
We are walking
down the aisle

00:07.633 --> 00:09.267
in less than
24 hours.

00:09.301 --> 00:11.603
Which gives you less than
23 hours to remember

00:11.937 --> 00:13.238
you're not the bride.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.607
I know,

00:15.641 --> 00:18.309
but Katie picked me to be her
maid of honor for a reason.

00:18.344 --> 00:20.345
I figured it was because she
didn't have any other friends.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.481
No.

00:23.516 --> 00:24.649
Well, not a lot,

00:24.683 --> 00:26.284
but she knew I would
get the job done.

00:26.318 --> 00:27.552
Okay.

00:27.586 --> 00:29.387
And you are doing
such an awesome job

00:29.422 --> 00:31.656
shoving hundreds of almonds
into little girly bags.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.658
Oh, wait.
These are my hands.

00:35.661 --> 00:38.563
Hey, I love a wedding,
okay.

00:38.597 --> 00:40.665
There's just
something so emotional.

00:40.699 --> 00:42.300
Oh.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.569
When the ladies start
throwing themselves at me.

00:46.739 --> 00:50.241
Hey, hey. If history
is any indication,

00:50.276 --> 00:52.277
they will be lining up
for a second helping

00:52.311 --> 00:53.378
from the Tucker buffet.

00:53.412 --> 00:55.580
You know what
I'm saying? Okay.

00:55.614 --> 00:57.248
Huh?

00:57.283 --> 00:58.516
What do you think?

01:00.386 --> 01:01.553
<i>Danny?</i>

01:01.587 --> 01:03.321
What are you doing?

01:03.355 --> 01:05.256
Breaking it in.

01:05.291 --> 01:07.625
Still kind of smells
like the last guy who wore it.

01:08.560 --> 01:09.794
Danny, no.

01:09.795 --> 01:11.396
I told you to get
something classy.

01:11.430 --> 01:13.398
Don't worry.
I'm gonna wear a shirt.

01:13.932 --> 01:16.334
It's even got ruffles.

01:17.403 --> 01:18.503
Hey, maidzilla.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.573
We're all doing the best
that we can here, okay?

01:21.607 --> 01:22.574
All right, done.

01:22.608 --> 01:24.342
Thank you.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.643
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

01:27.346 --> 01:29.547
Okay, actually
that was my best.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.618
One other quick thing
while you have a moment,

01:33.652 --> 01:36.688
is there any way you can put
me and Gene at the same table?

01:37.722 --> 01:39.224
Gene?

01:39.258 --> 01:40.525
Pig in the girls'
locker room Gene?

01:40.559 --> 01:44.429
Chili powder
in my jock strap Gene?

01:44.463 --> 01:46.598
Barf in my begonias Gene?

01:46.632 --> 01:49.234
Yeah. That Gene.

01:49.268 --> 01:51.302
No, no way.
He was not invited.

01:51.337 --> 01:53.438
I know. I thought
that was weird, too.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.674
So he's my plus one.

01:57.709 --> 01:59.310
I thought I was
your plus one?

01:59.345 --> 02:00.545
You can be Danny's
plus one.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.579
Why does he
have to be mine?

02:01.614 --> 02:03.515
I was gonna get
the beef and the chicken.

02:04.683 --> 02:08.252
All right, listen.
No one is getting a plus one.

02:08.287 --> 02:11.656
Oh, well then I am done
tying these little pink bows.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.424
I will come up with something
a little more threatening

02:13.459 --> 02:15.360
in a moment.

02:15.394 --> 02:17.395
You can come.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.663
But Gene cannot.

02:18.697 --> 02:21.566
Ben, this is supposed to be
a dignified and classy affair.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.168
- All right, there.
- Ow!

02:23.202 --> 02:24.202
Bride down,
people.

02:24.236 --> 02:25.203
Bride down.

02:25.205 --> 02:28.139
And it will
be classy.

02:28.174 --> 02:30.275
Gene's changed a lot
since high school.

02:30.309 --> 02:31.276
We all have.

02:36.182 --> 02:38.383
Give him a chance, please?

02:38.417 --> 02:39.551
Ugh. Fine.

02:39.585 --> 02:41.553
But I am warning you,
if that guy even--

02:44.290 --> 02:46.457
Hello?
Hi, this is Riley.

02:47.492 --> 02:48.459
What?

02:48.494 --> 02:50.395
No, you can't!

02:50.429 --> 02:51.629
But the wedding is tomorrow.

02:51.664 --> 02:53.364
Oh my God,
it's the caterer.

02:53.399 --> 02:54.532
They're canceling.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.267
Uh, listen.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.602
I am practically
a lawyer,

02:57.636 --> 02:59.204
and if you are not
there tomorrow

02:59.238 --> 03:00.605
with 500 salmon croquettes,
I will sue--

03:00.639 --> 03:02.574
What? Sue me?

03:04.443 --> 03:05.410
Gene.

03:05.444 --> 03:06.444
Gotcha!

03:09.148 --> 03:11.482
God, I hate
that guy.

03:14.286 --> 03:17.255

how the unexpected ♪</i>

03:17.289 --> 03:20.358

03:24.230 --> 03:26.598
I still can't believe you
invited Gene to the wedding.

03:26.632 --> 03:28.266
What were you thinking?

03:28.300 --> 03:29.467
I was thinking
it would be fun

03:29.501 --> 03:31.569
to invite somebody
who was actually...

03:31.604 --> 03:33.238
Fun.

03:33.272 --> 03:35.240
Just please tell me
you have everything all set up

03:35.274 --> 03:36.307
for tonight's
rehearsal dinner?

03:36.342 --> 03:38.376
We're good. I just
need to get some ice.

03:39.578 --> 03:40.612
And some liquor.

03:41.614 --> 03:43.414
And maybe some cups.

03:43.449 --> 03:46.284
Ben, ugh.
What is your problem?

03:46.318 --> 03:47.352
I don't know,
I'm sorry.

03:47.386 --> 03:49.487
It just feels like
they're rushing into it.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.589
They've been dating
since they were 11.

03:51.624 --> 03:53.491
Doesn't that
freak you out a little?

03:53.525 --> 03:54.626
We're the same age.

03:54.660 --> 03:58.263
Oh, well, we all know
how traditional you are.

03:58.297 --> 04:00.198
Hey, how's your baby?

04:01.467 --> 04:03.334
So, Riley.

04:03.369 --> 04:05.436
Too bad you waited
until after high school

04:05.471 --> 04:06.504
to get hot.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.206
Otherwise, it would
have been you and me

04:08.240 --> 04:10.341
instead of you
and my boy Ben here.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.342
Oh, me and Riley?

04:11.377 --> 04:13.177
No, no, no, no.
We're just friends.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.479
Yeah, me and Ben
together?

04:14.513 --> 04:17.214
That would be crazy.

04:17.249 --> 04:19.149
Oh, so you're
available?

04:19.184 --> 04:21.586
And once again,
I've shown up to the party

04:21.620 --> 04:23.421
just in time.

04:23.455 --> 04:25.556
And once again,
you are not invited.

04:28.294 --> 04:30.161
So, Wheeler...

04:30.195 --> 04:31.596
What's our back-story
for the ladies tonight?

04:31.630 --> 04:34.232
We Wall Street moguls
or brain surgeons?

04:34.266 --> 04:35.533
What about this--

04:35.567 --> 04:37.235
I'm a brain surgeon,

04:37.269 --> 04:38.369
and you're
a Wall Street mogul

04:38.404 --> 04:40.271
whose life
I just saved.

04:40.306 --> 04:42.340
Thank you, doctor.

04:42.374 --> 04:44.375
I'm eternally grateful.

04:47.313 --> 04:48.479
Can you believe it?

04:48.514 --> 04:50.615
Aah! I am actually
getting married.

04:50.649 --> 04:52.183
I know.

04:52.217 --> 04:53.518
But if I could just
get a few minutes

04:53.552 --> 04:54.619
of your undivided
attention

04:54.653 --> 04:56.220
to go over some of these
last minute details--

04:56.255 --> 04:58.156
- I am all yours.
- Great.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.490
So, first off, we have--

04:59.525 --> 05:01.459
It's from Dave!

05:01.493 --> 05:05.296
He misses me. Smiley face,
smiley face, heart.

05:05.331 --> 05:08.232
Aww. That's
adorable, Katie.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.467
But he's right there.

05:09.501 --> 05:10.468
Getting his coffee.

05:10.502 --> 05:12.403
Isn't he just
the sweetest?

05:12.438 --> 05:14.138
Oh, I just
love him.

05:15.374 --> 05:17.241
Yeah.
Don't we all.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.409
So, anyway,
as I was saying--

05:18.444 --> 05:23.314
Did you know that today
is our 4,643rd day as a couple?

05:23.349 --> 05:24.549
We've never been apart.

05:24.583 --> 05:28.386
Yeah. I remember some very
awkward slumber parties.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.288
Every time I think about
the day we met,

05:30.322 --> 05:32.256
I just get goosebumps
all over again.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.524
Oh, look!

05:33.559 --> 05:36.160
We're just never gonna
get through this, are we?

05:38.263 --> 05:41.265
And now, the most
important part of a wedding,

05:41.300 --> 05:42.600
the video.

05:42.634 --> 05:46.471
Which Katie asked me to do,
so suck it, Riley.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.207
Hi, Katie.

05:49.241 --> 05:51.175
Hey, Mom. Come on,
I thought you wanted to get us

05:51.210 --> 05:52.276
carrying the cake in.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.245
Yeah, and make sure
you get my good side.

05:54.279 --> 05:55.480
Well, actually
that should be easy

05:55.514 --> 05:57.448
because, you know,
both of my sides are good.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.486
Where is the focus
on this thing?

06:01.520 --> 06:03.154
You know, I haven't
used this camera

06:03.188 --> 06:05.223
since your father and I
tried to make a sex tape.

06:05.257 --> 06:08.126
Mom! Where are we
going with this?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.194
Well, we were just trying
to spice things up a little.

06:10.229 --> 06:11.362
No, Mom.
The cake.

06:11.397 --> 06:13.231
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
All right.

06:13.265 --> 06:15.366
All right,
I will guide you in,

06:15.401 --> 06:16.534
- all right?
- Watch the end.

06:16.568 --> 06:17.535
- All right.
- Watch the ottoman.

06:17.569 --> 06:20.204
Just another
couple of feet.

06:20.239 --> 06:21.205
Almost there,
we got this.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.507
- My biceps are gonna look great.
- All right, here we go.

06:22.541 --> 06:24.142
Oh, this looks
so great.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.410
<i>One, two...</i>

06:25.444 --> 06:27.111
- You're good.
- Okay.

06:27.146 --> 06:28.146
Oh!

06:32.884 --> 06:35.219
The depth perception
in this thing

06:35.254 --> 06:36.354
is horrible.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.196
What a warm and loving
tribute to your granddaughter.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.364
She will be so touched.

06:48.534 --> 06:51.235
Probably more touched if
I'd touched the on button.

06:52.337 --> 06:54.238
Hey, Tucker.

06:55.274 --> 06:57.341
So, it looks like
these two crazy kids

06:57.376 --> 06:59.343
are really gonna
do it, huh?

06:59.378 --> 07:03.181
You know, it just
makes me feel all...

07:03.215 --> 07:04.348
Vulnerable.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.318
I'm the bride.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.556
Oh.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.391
So I'm probably
wasting my time here?

07:13.425 --> 07:15.092
Mm-hmm.

07:15.127 --> 07:18.396
There's not a bridesmaids
holding area, is there?

07:20.566 --> 07:22.200
You look cute.

07:27.606 --> 07:29.574
Hey, Danny.

07:29.608 --> 07:31.342
I just came to check on--

07:31.376 --> 07:32.343
where's the cake?

07:32.877 --> 07:34.378
The cake.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.247
It's in the walk-in fridge
down at the bar.

07:36.281 --> 07:39.250
Wow. That was
a really good idea.

07:40.284 --> 07:42.386
Actually, that would have been
a really good idea.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.122
What is this
doing here?

07:45.157 --> 07:46.491
Oh, Emma wanted
to play with it.

07:47.525 --> 07:48.426
Argh.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.560
Aww.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.229
They always look
so perfect together

07:51.263 --> 07:52.530
on top of the cake.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.533
You're gonna be a
beautiful bride someday.

07:58.537 --> 08:00.271
Thank you.

08:00.805 --> 08:03.207
Still imagining yourself
up at the altar with Ben?

08:03.242 --> 08:05.276
Ben?

08:05.310 --> 08:07.311
No, I don't
think so.

08:07.346 --> 08:09.146
That was
just a crush.

08:09.181 --> 08:11.382
Well, someday
you'll find a guy

08:11.416 --> 08:13.184
who truly
appreciates you.

08:13.218 --> 08:14.318
A guy who can
look into your heart

08:14.353 --> 08:15.553
and know what
you're thinking.

08:20.492 --> 08:21.492
Yeah, okay.

08:23.228 --> 08:24.328
That would be nice.

08:24.363 --> 08:27.198
Someday, my heart

08:27.232 --> 08:28.432
should probably
get back upstairs.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.334
You know, party.

08:30.369 --> 08:31.569
Are you gonna come up?

08:31.603 --> 08:33.471
Yeah, in a minute.

08:33.505 --> 08:34.505
Okay.

08:40.178 --> 08:41.178
Oh.

08:45.284 --> 08:46.584
You know, Katie,
it's still not too late

08:46.618 --> 08:48.219
to shop around.

08:48.253 --> 08:50.488
How would you like to take a
ride on the Gene machine?

08:52.591 --> 08:54.225
And that's
the dating pool.

08:54.259 --> 08:55.393
You got out
just in time.

08:55.427 --> 08:56.494
All right, woo!

08:56.528 --> 08:58.296
Two minutes
to midnight.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.165
Dave, no seeing the bride
on the wedding day.

09:01.199 --> 09:02.199
All right,
let's move.

09:03.235 --> 09:04.335
I love you,
Katie cat.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.270
I love you more,
Davey bear.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.140
Aw, now you have
a whole night apart

09:09.174 --> 09:10.508
to think of
new nicknames!

09:11.510 --> 09:12.476
Okay, Wheeler.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.145
After hours bar,

09:14.179 --> 09:15.346
strip club,

09:15.380 --> 09:17.415
or after hours
strip club?

09:18.517 --> 09:19.517
Why limit ourselves?

09:19.551 --> 09:21.385
I don't know.

09:21.420 --> 09:24.121
Ben?
Wedding priorities?

09:24.156 --> 09:25.222
Tomorrow's
a big day.

09:25.257 --> 09:26.357
Wow.

09:26.391 --> 09:29.293
Who opened a bag
of "wah."

09:31.296 --> 09:33.097
Can you please
at least make sure

09:33.131 --> 09:34.298
Katie gets a cab
back to her hotel?

09:34.333 --> 09:37.101
Yes, I'll make sure
the bride gets home safe.

09:37.135 --> 09:38.135
And relax,

09:38.170 --> 09:39.470
I think I can
handle myself.

09:43.308 --> 09:45.376
Oh, my head.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.074

09:59.154 --> 10:00.253
Mmm... Davey bear

10:00.254 --> 10:03.156
don't you want to snuggle
with your Katie cat?

10:04.258 --> 10:07.127
It's actually
your Ben...

10:07.161 --> 10:08.195
Bunny.

10:09.363 --> 10:11.364
Ben, what are you
doing in my bed?

10:11.399 --> 10:12.465
Wondering what you're
doing in my bed.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.167
But how did I--

10:14.202 --> 10:16.303
wait, did we--?
Wait, what happened?!

10:16.337 --> 10:18.238
I was hoping you could
fill in some of those details.

10:18.272 --> 10:20.106
What am I gonna do?

10:20.141 --> 10:22.576
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life.

10:22.610 --> 10:24.177
Aah!

10:24.212 --> 10:26.513
Deep breath.
Deep quiet breath.

10:26.547 --> 10:28.448
Okay, we'll get you
out of here.

10:28.482 --> 10:30.450
It'll be our secret.
No one else will ever know.

10:31.952 --> 10:32.586
Morning.

10:32.620 --> 10:35.255
Oh, God, no!

10:37.291 --> 10:39.226
Okay, maybe just
one other person will know.

10:43.364 --> 10:44.431
What is the matter
with you?

10:44.465 --> 10:46.366
I don't have
a mother who knocks.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.501
She is getting married
in three hours.

10:48.536 --> 10:51.137
I know. You have to
help me get her out of here.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.606
Fine.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.341
But I'm not
doing this for you.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.410
I'm doing this for dear, sweet,
lovable, innocent Katie.

10:57.445 --> 10:59.279
Who will now
just be known as

10:59.313 --> 11:00.313
Katie.

11:00.348 --> 11:01.314
Be ready to move
in two.

11:03.217 --> 11:04.384
Judging from
this splatter pattern,

11:04.418 --> 11:06.319
I detect that this
is the bottom layer.

11:07.521 --> 11:09.422
Hey, Nancy Drew...

11:11.492 --> 11:12.525
Change of plans.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.261
You've got to
get out of here now.

11:14.295 --> 11:15.395
Oh, no.
Not happening.

11:15.429 --> 11:17.397
I've got a cake to build,
a tuxedo to wear,

11:17.431 --> 11:19.399
and a dance floor
to dominate.

11:19.433 --> 11:20.433
Okay.

11:20.468 --> 11:22.302
Whoo.
Yep, uh-huh.

11:22.336 --> 11:24.404
Okay, now where
is that top tier?

11:24.438 --> 11:26.306
Any chance that's it?

11:26.340 --> 11:28.174
What?

11:28.209 --> 11:30.543
Yes, that's it.
What is wrong with you?

11:31.478 --> 11:32.512
I was hungry.

11:32.546 --> 11:34.447
And I like cake.

11:34.482 --> 11:36.216
I just won't
have a piece later.

11:38.286 --> 11:41.154
What?! Right now?

11:41.188 --> 11:43.256
You're in the lobby?

11:43.291 --> 11:44.457
Guys, it's Riley.

11:44.492 --> 11:46.192
She's on
her way up.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.128
Go, go.
Cake, cake, cake.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.567
Congratulations
on your big day.

11:54.602 --> 11:56.603
You should still
wear white. I did.

11:58.672 --> 12:00.006
Hey, Margo.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.874
Is there any chance
Katie's in your room?

12:01.909 --> 12:03.709
What?

12:03.744 --> 12:05.011
No, of course she's here.

12:05.045 --> 12:06.813
Stop calling me.
I'm very busy. Bye.

12:09.049 --> 12:10.950
Oh my God. Katie.

12:10.984 --> 12:13.719
We are walking down the aisle
in less than three hours

12:13.754 --> 12:15.621
and you look like
you slept in a dumpster.

12:16.924 --> 12:17.924
I mean...

12:17.958 --> 12:19.959
How are you?

12:19.993 --> 12:21.861
I don't think
I can do it.

12:21.895 --> 12:24.664
I don't know
if I can get married.

12:24.698 --> 12:25.832
Katie,
what happened?

12:34.908 --> 12:36.909
Are you determined
to destroy this wedding?

12:36.944 --> 12:38.778
Honestly, Ben.
You are unbelievable.

12:38.812 --> 12:41.881
Yeah. Sometimes
I surprise even myself.

12:42.950 --> 12:44.750
But if our blabbity bride
would shut up,

12:44.785 --> 12:45.918
this whole problem
would go away.

12:45.953 --> 12:47.620
It's not going away.

12:47.654 --> 12:49.589
She's thinking of
calling off the wedding.

12:49.623 --> 12:51.057
Really?
Because of me?

12:51.091 --> 12:53.659
No, because she's running
away with the circus.

12:53.694 --> 12:54.727
Yes, because of you.

12:54.761 --> 12:56.963
God, these are
people's lives

12:56.997 --> 12:58.664
that you're
messing with, Ben.

12:58.699 --> 13:00.633
- So what should I do?
- I don't know.

13:00.667 --> 13:01.901
But you are
gonna fix this.

13:01.935 --> 13:02.902
Are we clear?

13:03.686 --> 13:04.837
Very.

13:07.774 --> 13:09.742
- Oh, you mean now? Okay...
- Oh my God.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.600
You.

13:17.635 --> 13:19.636
Yo, Katie.

13:19.670 --> 13:21.504
I just wanted
to check in

13:21.538 --> 13:23.573
and make sure you weren't
having any second thoughts.

13:23.607 --> 13:25.341
Second thoughts?

13:25.376 --> 13:26.542
Oh, we're way past
second thoughts.

13:26.577 --> 13:27.777
I don't know if
I can do this.

13:27.811 --> 13:29.712
I don't know if I can
get married now.

13:29.747 --> 13:32.315
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:32.349 --> 13:34.584
I sure hope it doesn't
have anything to do with me.

13:34.618 --> 13:37.720
It has everything
to do with you!

13:37.755 --> 13:39.555
Yeah, I've been
kind of hearing that.

13:39.590 --> 13:41.658
I thought
that I could do this.

13:41.692 --> 13:43.593
And then I thought "oh my
God, I cannot do this."

13:43.627 --> 13:45.361
And then I thought "nobody
needs to know what happened"

13:45.396 --> 13:46.496
because I don't even
know what happened,"

13:46.530 --> 13:47.530
and then I thought
"I will know,"

13:47.564 --> 13:49.365
and then I thought
"oh my God my head hurts

13:49.400 --> 13:50.466
from all my thoughts"!

13:51.802 --> 13:54.570
Did you ever think you might
be overreacting just a titch?

13:54.605 --> 13:56.372
Overreacting?

13:56.407 --> 13:57.774
You think that
I'm overreacting?

13:57.808 --> 13:59.409
Just throwing it
out there.

13:59.443 --> 14:00.643
Because I don't.

14:00.678 --> 14:02.478
I think I am reacting
exactly the way

14:02.513 --> 14:04.347
you're supposed to react
when you wake up in bed

14:04.381 --> 14:05.748
with some idiot
the morning of your wedding

14:05.783 --> 14:07.617
to the most wonderful
man in the world.

14:07.651 --> 14:09.585
I have been waiting
for this day

14:09.620 --> 14:10.720
my entire life.

14:10.754 --> 14:13.323
And you!
You-- you,

14:13.357 --> 14:15.692
Ben Wheeler, have
stolen it from me!

14:15.726 --> 14:18.594
Okay, now you're
making me feel bad.

14:18.629 --> 14:21.331
Ben, what if
Dave finds out?

14:21.365 --> 14:23.333
How can I ever
explain it to him?

14:23.367 --> 14:24.767
It's gonna be okay.

14:24.802 --> 14:27.337
I'm gonna leave this room, and we're
never gonna mention it again.

14:27.371 --> 14:28.371
Okay?

14:28.405 --> 14:29.505
Never happened.

14:29.540 --> 14:30.740
Dave is never
gonna find out.

14:30.774 --> 14:32.709
<i>Katie?</i>

14:32.743 --> 14:34.510
<i>Are you there?</i>

14:36.547 --> 14:37.580
<i>It's me, Dave.</i>

14:42.036 --> 14:44.020
Dave, you're not supposed
to see me before the wedding.

14:44.523 --> 14:45.690
<i>But we
need to talk.</i>

14:45.724 --> 14:48.726
<i>I got a text saying
I should ask you about Ben.</i>

14:48.761 --> 14:50.728
I thought you said
you didn't tell anyone.

14:50.763 --> 14:52.497
I didn't.

14:52.531 --> 14:53.698
I don't think.

14:53.732 --> 14:54.832
Still a little fuzzy
on the whole

14:54.867 --> 14:55.900
last night thing.

14:57.903 --> 14:59.737
Dave, you have to
believe me.

14:59.772 --> 15:01.506
I, uh--

15:01.540 --> 15:04.776
Oh, you look so cute
in your tux.

15:04.810 --> 15:06.677
What happened
between you and Ben?

15:06.712 --> 15:08.479
Nothing, I swear.

15:08.514 --> 15:09.914
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

15:09.948 --> 15:11.682
Oh, that's what
I like to see.

15:11.717 --> 15:13.484
Our two lovebirds
are back together

15:13.519 --> 15:14.685
and our wedding
is back on.

15:15.788 --> 15:17.488
When was it off?

15:17.523 --> 15:18.823
Never.

15:18.857 --> 15:20.691
You know, that's
just an expression.

15:20.726 --> 15:23.561
Like "break a leg"
or "have a nice day."

15:23.595 --> 15:24.562
What does that
even mean?

15:24.596 --> 15:26.464
All right,
run along now.

15:26.498 --> 15:27.665
You sure
everything's okay?

15:27.699 --> 15:28.766
I'm sure.

15:28.801 --> 15:30.802
Okay, all right.

15:30.836 --> 15:33.905
See, there, I knew
you would come to your senses.

15:33.939 --> 15:35.807
Whatever happened
between you and Ben

15:35.841 --> 15:38.743
was just a dirty rest stop on your
way down the happiness highway.

15:39.945 --> 15:41.679
Excuse me, Riley.
I was haling this.

15:41.713 --> 15:43.414
- Ben?
- I can't do it.

15:43.448 --> 15:44.916
The wedding is
officially off.

15:47.853 --> 15:50.588
You know, we were doing
fine until you showed up.

15:55.727 --> 15:57.728
Pretty impressive,
huh, Emma?

15:57.763 --> 15:59.630
Don't tell anyone,
but levels two and three

15:59.665 --> 16:00.898
are completely
made of cardboard

16:00.933 --> 16:02.433
and toothpaste.

16:04.403 --> 16:05.369
Hey, Mrs. Whee.

16:05.404 --> 16:06.370
Oh.

16:06.405 --> 16:07.738
Hey, mom.
What do you think?

16:07.773 --> 16:09.440
I think we should
get a move on

16:09.474 --> 16:10.474
while my hair
is still up

16:10.509 --> 16:12.410
and my dress shields
are still dry.

16:12.444 --> 16:13.444
Where's your brother?

16:13.478 --> 16:14.612
We're gonna be late
for this wedding.

16:14.646 --> 16:16.414
If it's even
actually happening.

16:16.448 --> 16:17.515
It better be.

16:17.549 --> 16:19.717
Look, I have narrowed down
my list of eligible ladies

16:19.751 --> 16:21.552
to an elite eight.

16:21.587 --> 16:25.623
Do not deny them
Tucker in a tux.

16:25.657 --> 16:27.425
Wait, why wouldn't it
be happening?

16:27.459 --> 16:28.593
Oh, I don't know.

16:28.627 --> 16:31.662
Maybe a little thing called
"Ben slept with the bride."

16:31.697 --> 16:33.831
Ben slept with the bride?

16:35.734 --> 16:37.535
That is so wrong.

16:37.569 --> 16:38.703
I totally
hit on her first.

16:38.737 --> 16:40.872
Ben would never
do that.

16:40.906 --> 16:41.873
Come on,
back me up, Mom.

16:41.907 --> 16:43.741
Oh, Ben is guilty
as sin.

16:43.775 --> 16:44.775
You should see
the video.

16:44.810 --> 16:45.810
<i>What?</i>

16:45.844 --> 16:47.879
The question is...

16:47.913 --> 16:50.681
How did you know, Gene?

16:50.716 --> 16:52.817
Oh, I have my ways.

16:52.851 --> 16:55.686
Oh, and so do I.

16:55.721 --> 16:57.588
- Tucker?
- Huh?

16:57.623 --> 16:59.590
- Hold my earrings.
- I got you, girl.

17:01.627 --> 17:03.461
Katie, please
come out.

17:03.495 --> 17:05.762
Just put on the dress.
You'll feel better.

17:05.797 --> 17:07.865
I know I did
when I had it on.

17:09.701 --> 17:11.469
Probably not important
right now.

17:12.738 --> 17:14.405
Don't you get it?

17:14.439 --> 17:17.742
I have never lied
to Dave before, ever.

17:17.776 --> 17:20.544
If I can lie this easily
to my future husband,

17:20.579 --> 17:22.413
then maybe you and Gene
were right.

17:22.446 --> 17:23.814
Maybe I'm not ready
to get married.

17:23.848 --> 17:27.718
Okay, first lesson.
Never listen to Ben and Gene.

17:27.752 --> 17:29.620
Katie, you have to
marry Dave.

17:29.655 --> 17:31.422
Sometimes
Ben's okay.

17:32.691 --> 17:34.458
And why should I?

17:34.493 --> 17:35.760
So you can
stop feeling guilty?

17:35.794 --> 17:37.395
No.

17:37.429 --> 17:39.664
Because you're truly
meant to be together.

17:39.698 --> 17:41.599
You love him
and he loves you.

17:41.633 --> 17:44.435
You have since the moment
you set eyes on each other.

17:44.469 --> 17:47.571
I was just being a jerk
because...

17:47.606 --> 17:48.773
I'm jealous.

17:48.807 --> 17:50.508
Of me and Dave?

17:50.542 --> 17:52.643
Who isn't?

17:52.678 --> 17:54.812
You have what
everybody wants.

17:54.846 --> 17:56.881
A true love,
a soul mate,

17:56.915 --> 17:59.817
a best friend,
all rolled into one.

18:00.851 --> 18:02.620
The rest of us are just
running around like idiots

18:02.654 --> 18:04.689
hoping for even half
of what you have.

18:06.857 --> 18:08.359
I just wish that...

18:08.393 --> 18:10.795
One day, I'll look up
at a girl and just...

18:10.829 --> 18:12.430
Know.

18:14.433 --> 18:17.368
Say yes.
You have to say yes.

18:17.402 --> 18:18.636
Yes.

18:18.670 --> 18:20.838
Yes, thank you.

18:20.872 --> 18:22.506
All right, let's move.

18:22.541 --> 18:24.742
We've got a wedding
to put on here, people.

18:28.613 --> 18:29.580
What are you guys
all doing here?

18:29.614 --> 18:31.549
Making a few
deliveries.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.617
Tux, cake,
and dirt bag.

18:34.853 --> 18:35.820
Wait, where's Emma?

18:35.854 --> 18:37.521
Bridesmaids
holding area.

18:37.556 --> 18:40.524
Hold up. What?
That's a real thing?

18:40.559 --> 18:42.727
What is going on?
That is not the cake I ordered.

18:42.761 --> 18:44.795
Okay, mister.

18:44.830 --> 18:46.597
You're up.

18:46.631 --> 18:48.566
Gene, what did you do?

18:50.502 --> 18:52.403
Last night after
you both passed out

18:52.437 --> 18:53.604
in separate rooms,

18:53.638 --> 18:55.740
I kind of put you and
Katie in bed together.

18:59.444 --> 19:00.745
Gotcha!

19:01.279 --> 19:02.580
What?!

19:03.815 --> 19:05.683
So we didn't--?

19:05.717 --> 19:07.585
Nope.

19:07.619 --> 19:09.653
Let me handle this.

19:13.759 --> 19:15.493
Now I gotcha.

19:17.396 --> 19:21.532
Oh, of all the times
not to be rolling.

19:21.566 --> 19:24.602
Okay, is there any chance
that you could do this again?

19:24.636 --> 19:25.803
All right,
we can do this here.

19:31.810 --> 19:33.778
Hey.

19:33.812 --> 19:35.579
Hey.

19:35.614 --> 19:37.782
So, what'd you think?

19:37.816 --> 19:40.518
I think you did
a pretty amazing job.

19:40.552 --> 19:43.487
We did
a pretty amazing job.

19:43.522 --> 19:44.588
Okay, me.

19:46.391 --> 19:47.358
Did you
have fun tonight?

19:47.392 --> 19:49.727
I actually did.

19:49.761 --> 19:51.695
My only regret,

19:51.730 --> 19:53.531
I didn't get to dance
with the maid of honor.

19:53.565 --> 19:56.534
Well, the night
isn't over yet.

20:06.911 --> 20:09.547
Did you mean everything
you said to Katie?

20:10.381 --> 20:11.415
I did.

20:12.818 --> 20:14.885
Do you ever think we'll find
that special someone?

20:16.822 --> 20:18.522
I'd like to think so.

20:19.724 --> 20:21.592
<i>You know, a wise man
once told me</i>

20:21.626 --> 20:24.462
that someday you'll
meet someone

20:24.496 --> 20:25.663
and they'll look
right into your heart.

20:31.837 --> 20:33.671
We should probably
get back, huh?

20:35.440 --> 20:36.474
What's the hurry?

20:39.409 --> 20:40.778
Woo.

20:56.792 --> 20:59.992
I just never imagined
this happening so soon.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.492
But I guess when two people have
known each other their whole lives,

21:02.493 --> 21:04.126
it just becomes
inevitable.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.060
I know it feels fast,

21:06.094 --> 21:08.360
but when it's right,
it's right.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.794
Okay.

21:11.828 --> 21:12.728
Let's do this.

21:14.597 --> 21:16.831
<i>By the power
vested in me,</i>

21:17.166 --> 21:18.633
I now pronounce you

21:18.668 --> 21:20.702
giraffe and wife.

21:21.837 --> 21:23.738
You may now
drool on the groom.

21:25.508 --> 21:26.775
Tall, dark,
and machine washable--

21:26.809 --> 21:28.777
well done, Emma.

21:28.811 --> 21:30.845
All right, that's
one Wheeler down.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.913
Who's next?

21:31.914 --> 21:35.913
