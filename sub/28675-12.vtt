00:00.010 --> 00:01.939
Smurf knows that you talked to the cops.

00:01.940 --> 00:04.122
If you stay here, you will be killed.

00:04.123 --> 00:05.832
My brother's kind of strange.

00:05.833 --> 00:07.289
What's the hole out in the field?

00:07.290 --> 00:09.400
- A bunker.
- Jed's stockpiling gold.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.710
What's back there, baby?

00:13.716 --> 00:15.092
I have a job for us.

00:15.093 --> 00:17.345
And this time, I will be joining you.

00:17.360 --> 00:21.219
You boys have been having all
the fun for way too long.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.239
Smurf up?

00:22.240 --> 00:24.686
She left with some people
from La Jolla last night.

00:24.690 --> 00:26.938
- Where is it?
- What?

00:29.560 --> 00:31.239
You're done with that shit.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.651
You think I wanted this to happen?

00:32.652 --> 00:34.528
J took me to Kalani's for lunch...

00:34.529 --> 00:36.539
- 'Sup, Pope?
- I'm looking for Angela.

00:36.540 --> 00:37.919
Have you seen her?

00:37.920 --> 00:40.701
Yesterday. She was with Julia's kid.

00:40.702 --> 00:42.953
You didn't forget about seeing Angela.

00:42.954 --> 00:45.831
- You just keep lying to me, J.
- Pope, it's...

00:45.832 --> 00:47.874
When Smurf's gone, so are you.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.620
Back, back!

00:53.540 --> 00:55.299
Colin? Hey!

00:55.300 --> 00:56.920
- Colin?
- He's dead, Janine.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.879
You should go back to the house,

02:14.880 --> 02:16.760
eat something.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.260
I'm not hungry.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.226
You gonna have a boy or a girl?

02:29.460 --> 02:32.699
I don't know.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.820
You never asked?

02:37.560 --> 02:40.070
I haven't seen a doctor.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.999
Denial I guess.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.662
Pretty hard to deny now.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.919
It's getting dark.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.480
You want to get inside,
coyotes will be out soon.

05:17.330 --> 05:19.339
Hey. What time'd you get home?

05:19.340 --> 05:21.469
Late.

05:21.470 --> 05:23.469
You don't want to try and
get some more sleep?

05:23.470 --> 05:26.409
No, I got to get back to work.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.669
This Smurf thing?

05:27.670 --> 05:29.519
- Hmm?
- This Smurf thing?

05:29.520 --> 05:31.879
Yeah.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.809
You manage to get some sleep?

05:33.810 --> 05:34.980
Some.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.079
Yeah, I tried to be quiet
when I came in last night.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.098
Oh, believe me,

05:41.099 --> 05:44.046
it's not you I'm worried
about keeping me up.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.059
Everything okay?

05:49.060 --> 05:50.339
Yeah.

05:50.340 --> 05:52.799
Careful today.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.220
Always.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.250
I gotta get ready... gotta go.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.229
I made a coffee cake yesterday,

06:17.230 --> 06:20.791
I could heat some up for
you if you're hungry.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.960
No, thanks.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.550
You think Smurf's even
gonna show for this thing?

06:31.100 --> 06:34.339
She said she'd be here, she'll be here.

06:41.687 --> 06:43.550
You don't have to go.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.570
Yeah, we do.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.620
So, what's the plan?

07:04.627 --> 07:06.350
Indonesia?

07:08.370 --> 07:10.799
Great surfing, no extradition treaty.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.799
Is that our only choice?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.200
There's Syria or Angola.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.989
What about the house,

07:24.990 --> 07:26.729
we just walk away,

07:26.730 --> 07:29.210
leave food in the fridge
and the lights on?

07:33.190 --> 07:35.620
We'll talk about all that shit
when I get back from this thing.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.390
Are you sure about this one?

07:41.140 --> 07:43.520
No.

07:57.860 --> 08:01.260
- I need a car.
- What?

08:01.270 --> 08:03.130
You buried mine.

08:05.380 --> 08:08.100
Does that car work?

08:10.560 --> 08:13.369
Thought you'd want to stick around,

08:13.370 --> 08:15.140
what with the baby coming and all.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.879
That and being wracked with guilt

08:18.880 --> 08:21.330
about my brother's death.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.619
Nah, I'm gonna hit the road.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.360
I don't like staying
in one place too long.

08:32.530 --> 08:35.479
So, how much you want for it?

08:35.480 --> 08:36.635
How much you got?

08:36.640 --> 08:38.979
What?

08:38.980 --> 08:42.068
I'm Colin's next of kin,

08:42.070 --> 08:46.409
whatever him and you
stole got him killed,

08:46.410 --> 08:49.440
figure his share should be coming to me.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.080
Uh...

08:54.090 --> 08:57.019
I think Colin would want that money

08:57.020 --> 08:59.949
to go to his unborn child, don't you?

09:04.880 --> 09:07.110
You're probably right.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.219
Car needs some work.

09:12.220 --> 09:13.499
How about 10 grand?

09:16.370 --> 09:19.569
I-I can give you $500 for it.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.680
Eight grand.

09:24.700 --> 09:29.340
$500 is my best and last.

09:29.350 --> 09:34.239
Otherwise I can head down to that road,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.979
show some leg, stick my thumb out.

09:36.980 --> 09:38.839
I'm sure some local
redneck will slow down

09:38.840 --> 09:41.240
for a pregnant girl.

09:50.500 --> 09:57.339
All right, now that you're family

09:57.340 --> 10:01.019
and I'm gonna be an uncle.

10:01.020 --> 10:03.599
$500.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.799
I'll even tune it up for you,

10:05.800 --> 10:07.380
make sure it's running right.

10:08.490 --> 10:10.959
It should be ready tomorrow.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.919
Oh, for 500 bucks,

10:20.920 --> 10:24.250
make sure it has a full tank of gas.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.819
Yo. She's back?

10:43.820 --> 10:44.879
Yep.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.760
She say where the hell she's been?

10:46.770 --> 10:49.029
No.

10:49.030 --> 10:50.579
So we're still on for this thing?

10:50.580 --> 10:52.429
Well, it seems like it.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.299
- Jesus.
- How's she look?

10:54.300 --> 10:55.969
She looks like Smurf.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.529
You ready?

12:31.340 --> 12:33.020
I'm ready.

12:42.060 --> 12:45.170
J, drive the truck.

12:45.180 --> 12:47.677
We'll follow you guys.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.760
Hey, get out. I'm driving.

13:44.670 --> 13:49.340
You think Craig will figure
out how to be a good dad?

13:49.350 --> 13:50.989
How would I know?

13:50.990 --> 13:53.959
Never had a dad, good or otherwise.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.440
Neither did Craig.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.619
There must be a book.

13:59.620 --> 14:03.439
They've got a book for
everything nowadays.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.899
Yeah.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.299
That's what you'll do.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.740
Buy him a book.

14:11.020 --> 14:13.959
What did they name it?

14:13.960 --> 14:15.349
Um, Nick.

14:15.350 --> 14:18.279
Nick... right. Nick.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.169
What kind of name is Nick?

14:20.170 --> 14:22.100
Why Nick?

14:22.110 --> 14:25.239
I have no idea.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.440
Renn's idea.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.730
Maybe.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.819
Adrian has been talking to the police.

14:38.820 --> 14:43.320
He's been talking for a while.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.519
About what?

14:45.520 --> 14:47.940
About us.

14:47.950 --> 14:49.669
Does Deran know?

14:49.670 --> 14:50.960
Deran knows.

14:53.660 --> 14:59.849
J, I don't think Deran is
strong enough to handle this.

14:59.850 --> 15:03.149
Do you, baby?

15:26.920 --> 15:29.839
How much longer till you get through?

15:29.840 --> 15:31.800
About an hour or so.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.339
Everybody clear on the plan?

15:40.900 --> 15:42.220
Let's go.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.259
See you on the other side.

16:25.080 --> 16:29.380
Come to bed, honey, it's late.

17:17.030 --> 17:20.398
How do you know these people?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.118
Through friends.

17:22.119 --> 17:24.239
Friends?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.940
It was a long time ago.

17:27.260 --> 17:30.499
Why didn't we just tunnel
in and steal the gold?

17:30.500 --> 17:32.462
It's be hours and days before

17:32.470 --> 17:34.229
they'd be likely to figure
out they've been robbed.

17:34.230 --> 17:37.569
They have security cameras inside.

17:37.570 --> 17:39.980
All we need to do is keep them occupied

17:39.990 --> 17:41.659
and away from the bunker.

17:41.660 --> 17:45.160
Do that by starting a fire
in one of these fields,

17:45.170 --> 17:46.509
dry enough to burn.

17:46.510 --> 17:49.271
These people are Preppers, paranoid.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.659
First sign of something weird happens,

17:51.660 --> 17:52.816
what do you think they do?

17:52.817 --> 17:55.819
They go make sure their bunker is safe.

17:55.820 --> 17:56.903
Turn here.

18:11.860 --> 18:15.359
How are we supposed to let
them know we're here?

18:15.360 --> 18:18.257
They know we're here.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.299
We there?

18:38.940 --> 18:42.260
Yeah, man.

18:42.270 --> 18:43.839
What's going on?

18:43.840 --> 18:45.100
We're here. Text Smurf.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.490
Okay.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.920
They're at the bunker.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.964
Pull over under that tree.

19:45.262 --> 19:47.880
What is this place?

19:51.220 --> 19:53.060
Smurf?

19:54.840 --> 19:57.480
Your father's buried here.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.100
What?

20:03.520 --> 20:05.520
Right in front of that tree.

20:24.660 --> 20:26.960
Andrew, this is your Uncle Jed.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.890
And that's your cousin, Odin.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.839
Clear.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.449
Go get the torch.

21:45.380 --> 21:48.680
What are we doing here, Smurf?

21:48.690 --> 21:50.619
What the hell are you up to?

21:54.100 --> 21:57.840
Took me a minute, but I found them.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.710
Hmm.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.840
This is gotta be '70, right?

22:06.320 --> 22:09.820
After Dad left for Fresno,
looking for work.

22:12.450 --> 22:18.399
Your grandfather was a roughneck
working drilling rigs,

22:18.400 --> 22:22.399
when he was sober enough to stand up.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.119
Never could hold a job very long,

22:25.120 --> 22:28.675
always wound up punching the
boss or something worse.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.929
You never showed him pictures of Colin?

22:33.930 --> 22:36.040
I didn't have any to show.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.699
I got out of here pretty
fast, you remember, Jed?

22:42.680 --> 22:45.339
Where's Jeremy and David, Jed?

22:45.340 --> 22:48.861
I'd like Andrew to meet
his other two cousins.

22:48.862 --> 22:51.149
They're out working the
fence that's down.

22:51.150 --> 22:53.659
Tree branch broke off in
the Santa Ana last night.

22:53.660 --> 22:55.870
They'll be back soon.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.199
This is your dad

23:00.200 --> 23:02.499
before he left for Vietnam.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.479
I've got his medals
around here somewhere.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.040
Hmm.

23:07.050 --> 23:09.100
Goddamn hero.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.151
Bitch.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.419
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

24:18.420 --> 24:20.244
Shit.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.899
Iodine?

24:57.940 --> 24:59.609
That's good.

25:02.490 --> 25:04.039
Whoo!

25:15.560 --> 25:19.099
It's in better shape than I remembered.

25:19.100 --> 25:22.020
I don't think $500's gonna do it.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.340
A deal's a deal.

25:33.350 --> 25:36.480
Yeah, really?

25:36.500 --> 25:39.030
Who told you that?

25:40.380 --> 25:43.279
Did you put gas in it?

25:43.280 --> 25:45.620
I tell you what...

25:48.260 --> 25:50.319
Why don't you and me just have ourselves

25:50.320 --> 25:52.929
some fun instead.

25:52.930 --> 25:55.507
Maybe I'll give you the car for free.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.460
I'm eight months pregnant.

26:00.270 --> 26:02.680
Yeah, you still got a mouth.

26:28.140 --> 26:32.909
And then I get to leave with the car?

26:57.160 --> 26:59.529
Yeah. You like that?

27:15.580 --> 27:16.780
Shit!

27:18.520 --> 27:19.959
Bitch!

27:23.520 --> 27:26.347
You asshole!

27:28.920 --> 27:31.699
Oh, shit!

27:42.880 --> 27:45.740
Jed!

27:45.780 --> 27:48.620
Son of a bitch!

27:51.200 --> 27:54.499
Jed, leave her alone!

28:07.280 --> 28:11.219
Stop! Jed, please stop it!

28:20.660 --> 28:21.720
Oh, God.

29:34.620 --> 29:36.259
You were born right here,

29:36.260 --> 29:40.640
you and your sister.

29:40.650 --> 29:44.750
Odin, too, and both his brothers.

29:46.696 --> 29:47.719
How is your sister?

29:47.720 --> 29:50.580
Smurf never tells me a damn thing.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.740
She's dead.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.679
Drugs.

29:56.680 --> 30:00.640
Sorry to hear that.
That's a damn tragedy.

30:00.650 --> 30:02.349
Sure is.

30:02.350 --> 30:05.460
FDA pushing opioids

30:05.470 --> 30:07.859
so politicians can line their pockets

30:07.860 --> 30:09.579
with drug company money

30:09.580 --> 30:12.359
- _
- and keep the citizenry addicted,

30:12.360 --> 30:15.680
docile like sheep, under control.

30:17.430 --> 30:18.640
You need to make a call?

30:19.830 --> 30:23.599
It's the pool guy fixing the heater.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.260
Still fiddling while
Rome burns, huh, Smurf?

30:27.040 --> 30:29.860
Let's get down to business now.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.150
Yeah, sure. What do you need?

30:32.158 --> 30:33.979
Two ARs.

30:33.980 --> 30:36.449
Extra mags and ammo to go with.

30:36.450 --> 30:37.719
Hollow points?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.539
Some. And standard loads.

30:39.540 --> 30:41.250
- Mix it up.
- It ain't gonna be cheap.

30:41.251 --> 30:43.086
Not gonna be a problem.

30:43.990 --> 30:45.671
Should we go look at the merchandise?

30:48.160 --> 30:50.630
How about that?

30:50.635 --> 30:53.530
Let's get down to the bunker.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.519
What the hell are you doing?

31:17.520 --> 31:18.829
- Let's go.
- Are you kidding me, bro?

31:18.830 --> 31:20.019
We can take this out of the desert

31:20.020 --> 31:22.080
and tear shit up.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.580
Boys.

31:53.700 --> 31:54.739
What the hell?

31:54.740 --> 31:56.240
Hey, Jed?

31:58.578 --> 32:00.787
Shit! Dad!

32:00.788 --> 32:03.409
A deal's a deal.

32:03.410 --> 32:06.160
Odin, get over here.

32:07.670 --> 32:10.965
Come out, boys, let's do this!

32:10.980 --> 32:13.249
Come on!

32:13.250 --> 32:14.635
Smurf!

32:19.850 --> 32:21.879
What was that?

32:21.880 --> 32:24.619
That's gunfire, man.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.354
Let's go, let's go.

32:26.355 --> 32:29.019
Yo, wrap this up! Let's go!

32:32.480 --> 32:33.859
Smurf!

32:47.520 --> 32:48.920
Okay, wait... no!

32:48.960 --> 32:51.129
Where are you taking me?

33:04.920 --> 33:05.969
No!

33:05.970 --> 33:09.040
Andrew, no! Don't leave!

33:09.050 --> 33:10.469
No!

33:10.470 --> 33:13.027
You son of a bitch!

33:17.920 --> 33:19.109
What's going on...

33:19.110 --> 33:20.179
Nothing, man.

33:20.180 --> 33:22.739
Shit.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.360
What is that?

33:28.543 --> 33:30.249
The truck, truck. Go.

33:30.250 --> 33:32.171
Back up.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.379
- It's Pope.
- Back up.

33:36.380 --> 33:37.660
- It's Pope!
- What?

33:39.980 --> 33:41.319
Pope.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.499
What happened?

33:42.500 --> 33:43.557
Shit, man, what happened?

33:43.558 --> 33:45.429
Are you hit?

33:45.430 --> 33:47.399
What happened?!

33:47.400 --> 33:49.063
She okay?

33:50.960 --> 33:52.180
What happened?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.000
What happened?

33:54.040 --> 33:55.520
What happened?

33:55.528 --> 33:57.900
Get off of me!

33:59.160 --> 34:00.992
You idiot!

34:01.000 --> 34:04.280
Can't you ever get anything right?!

34:04.900 --> 34:05.990
Smurf, you're bleeding.

34:05.997 --> 34:08.581
I know I'm bleeding!

34:08.583 --> 34:10.750
I'm supposed to be dead!

34:10.751 --> 34:12.793
And you... it up!

34:12.795 --> 34:15.789
You're in shock. You get in the truck.

34:15.790 --> 34:17.879
Don't you touch me!

34:17.880 --> 34:20.420
Don't you dare.

34:21.770 --> 34:25.599
Keep your hands off of me,

34:25.600 --> 34:28.199
every one of you.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.219
Okay.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.860
Deran, baby,

34:37.880 --> 34:39.196
give me your gun.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.659
Give me your gun, Deran.

34:44.659 --> 34:45.668
Smurf, come on.

34:45.670 --> 34:46.820
- Give it to me.
- Smurf...

34:46.840 --> 34:49.620
Now, Deran.

34:49.623 --> 34:51.159
Smurf.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.240
Give Pope your gun.

35:00.880 --> 35:01.880
What? No.

35:01.881 --> 35:03.160
- Do it, Craig.
- No.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.949
Do it for me, my baby.

35:04.950 --> 35:06.389
- Smurf...
- Do it for your mother.

35:06.390 --> 35:09.599
- Put the gun down.
- Give Pope your gun.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.559
Give me your damn gun!

35:11.560 --> 35:13.150
- Give it to me.
- I'm not gonna give you the...

35:13.160 --> 35:14.999
Come on.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.019
You happy?

35:21.980 --> 35:26.609
Shoot me, Andrew.

35:26.610 --> 35:28.740
Oh, shit.

35:29.440 --> 35:30.740
Shoot me!

35:31.520 --> 35:33.000
No.

35:33.940 --> 35:36.799
Andrew, don't you get it?

35:36.800 --> 35:38.660
I'm already dead!

35:38.680 --> 35:41.159
It's over.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.359
And you're gonna make sure I don't die

35:43.360 --> 35:45.620
in some filthy hospital bed,

35:46.440 --> 35:51.340
weak and helpless.

35:52.060 --> 35:53.930
Shoot me, Andrew!

35:53.960 --> 35:56.889
I'm begging you!

35:56.890 --> 35:58.439
Breathe.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.999
Breathe, honey, a deep breath in,

36:00.000 --> 36:01.809
a deep breath in. You can do it.

36:01.810 --> 36:03.199
Breathe.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.439
There we go. Yeah, okay.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.451
You just got to push.

36:07.470 --> 36:09.940
Push, sweetheart.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.255
Come on, baby. Do it.

36:20.470 --> 36:21.499
No.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.250
There we go. That's great, great, great.

36:23.259 --> 36:24.359
Push, push, push, push, push!

36:24.360 --> 36:26.260
Push harder. Harder.

36:26.270 --> 36:27.388
It's out.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.180
It's a girl.

36:32.360 --> 36:35.810
Yeah. A beautiful little girl.

36:35.820 --> 36:40.019
You... died out there
with me, you know that?

36:40.020 --> 36:42.690
Don't you believe for one second

36:42.695 --> 36:45.238
- that I won't pull this trigger.
- You wanted me to die?

36:45.239 --> 36:48.529
You can't survive without me!

36:48.530 --> 36:49.959
None of you can!

36:53.120 --> 36:56.019
Ow. Ow! Ow! Ow! Why?

36:56.020 --> 36:58.729
What's happening?

36:58.730 --> 37:00.159
I don't think you're done, honey.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.169
What?

37:01.170 --> 37:03.007
There's another baby coming.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.379
You're all weak!

37:05.380 --> 37:07.219
I'm strong!

37:07.220 --> 37:10.199
I had to be strong for all of you!

37:10.200 --> 37:11.760
One more push, one more push.

37:12.950 --> 37:15.079
It's out. It's out, honey.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.549
It's out.

37:16.550 --> 37:18.063
It's a boy.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.640
It's a boy.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.319
... shoot me, Andrew.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.070
- No.
- He's been born with teeth.

37:26.420 --> 37:30.951
It means he'll be fierce, a warrior.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.119
Kill me.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.360
No.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.099
Jesus Christ, Smurf!

37:42.110 --> 37:43.279
Twins.

37:43.280 --> 37:48.119
Shoot me, you goddamn pussy!

37:48.120 --> 37:49.259
Shoot me!

37:49.260 --> 37:50.839
Smurf, come on. She's gonna do it, Pope!

37:50.840 --> 37:53.799
- Smurf! Christ!
- Kill me, you goddamn...

37:53.800 --> 37:54.819
Smurf!

38:16.120 --> 38:19.440
Someone could've heard the gunshots.

38:19.460 --> 38:23.838
Gotta get out of here
before the cops come.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.059
We need to call the doctor that you use.

39:32.060 --> 39:34.740
- What's his name?
- Why?

39:34.750 --> 39:38.019
We can't take her to the
mortuary like this,

39:38.020 --> 39:39.284
they'll call the cops.

39:39.285 --> 39:42.875
She needs to have died in her
own bed from the cancer.

39:43.660 --> 39:46.629
And we need a doctor to
sign the death certificate

39:46.630 --> 39:48.119
that says so.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.239
I'll call him.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.290
Where's your truck?

40:03.060 --> 40:05.760
- Pope.
- What?

40:06.860 --> 40:08.659
Where's your truck? Did
you leave it out there?

40:08.660 --> 40:11.189
I was in a gunfight.

40:11.190 --> 40:14.480
I barely got out of there alive.

40:59.650 --> 41:01.769
Whatcha doing out here?

41:27.700 --> 41:29.199
Craig?

41:50.461 --> 41:52.160
It's getting cold.

41:57.900 --> 42:00.210
Doctor get here yet?

42:02.300 --> 42:03.890
No.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.859
Smart.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.300
What?

42:15.520 --> 42:18.489
The doctor. The truck.

42:19.820 --> 42:23.079
They need you,

42:23.080 --> 42:24.789
they know that now.

42:24.790 --> 42:28.599
The Preppers will come
for us eventually,

42:28.600 --> 42:30.459
truck or no truck.

42:32.860 --> 42:34.869
Was it bad?

42:40.886 --> 42:42.809
You gonna be okay?

42:49.470 --> 42:51.300
Yeah.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.200
I'll be fine.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.779
Hey.

43:27.780 --> 43:29.800
You okay?

43:33.760 --> 43:35.482
We're getting the hell out of here,

43:37.820 --> 43:39.929
and we're never coming back.

43:48.340 --> 43:50.789
Have you decided what to name them yet?

43:52.600 --> 43:55.349
Well, I knew I was gonna have a girl,

43:55.350 --> 44:00.039
so we already had a name
picked out for her.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.870
Julia.

44:02.840 --> 44:05.340
That's a beautiful name.

44:11.220 --> 44:19.019
But this one, the boy, I don't know.

44:19.020 --> 44:23.879
Colin liked Andrew.

44:23.880 --> 44:27.219
After some hockey player.

44:27.220 --> 44:28.439
Andrew?

44:28.440 --> 44:29.899
Mm-hmm.

44:29.900 --> 44:33.120
Sure, that's a nice name.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.040
You can call him Andy.

44:37.340 --> 44:38.880
Hey.

44:40.380 --> 44:43.250
Do you like it, Andrew?

44:43.258 --> 44:44.999
Hmm?
