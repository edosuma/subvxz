00:05.380 --> 00:08.839

QUENTIN: I'm sorry you didn't
get to know your father.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.611
I guess you're stuck knowing me.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.280
What I saw in her
is what I see here.

00:33.784 --> 00:37.448
It sounds crazy, but if there is just
some way to get through to her...

00:37.538 --> 00:39.200
- We have a massively huge problem.
- What is it?

00:39.289 --> 00:40.905
The nano-thermite,

00:42.209 --> 00:43.245
JOHN: <i>Cayden James could do it.</i>

00:43.335 --> 00:44.746
And he'd probably detonate
in a populated area.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.160
Maximize casualties.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.835
Your city's entire infrastructure
is under my control.

Buildings, institutions, even people,

00:54.388 --> 00:56.220

00:56.306 --> 00:57.387
These are innocent people.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.715

00:59.309 --> 01:02.723

stepping up to lead the department.

better circumstances.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.585
After tonight, they will be.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.290
All right, take me
through the details.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.249
We know Cayden James is monitoring
traffic in and out of the city.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.004
Airports, highways, ports.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.759

might be the blind spot.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.212

01:37.306 --> 01:39.298
there's no satellite flyover
for about 10 minutes.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.598
That's our window.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.720
SWAT has the perimeter,

01:41.810 --> 01:43.847
so no one's getting in or out
without us knowing it.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.348
Good. When do we make contact?

01:45.647 --> 01:46.728
Should be any minute.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.202
Mr. Mayor, I'm Alex Scott, A.R.G.U.S.

I mean, don't they have plans
for this kind of stuff?

02:58.261 --> 03:01.550
A.R.G.U.S. was our best shot,
and Cayden James was ready for it.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.801
I think that we are on our own.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.762
So does that mean I go forward
with the emergency bomb shelters?

03:08.855 --> 03:13.145
Yeah. We need a contingency.
It won't save everyone.

Cayden keeps the bomb

He's become especially paranoid
since I killed one of his men.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.007
Your stunt with A.R.G.U.S. last night
didn't help matters.

No, no. There's no way he can do that
without Cayden noticing, Felicity.

that he's circling the wagons.

FELICITY: Okay, Cayden's server
is deep within the building,

11:25.602 --> 11:28.219
so while our comms will be working,
transmitting a data-pull that large,

11:28.313 --> 11:29.679
it requires line of sight.

have to install the sniffer,

then wait for it to download
the content to Cayden James' server.

Making sure Cayden doesn't see you or
the sniffer. That'd be bad, very bad.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.440
And then get it outside
so you can transmit the files.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.526
Yeah, that sounds
like more than two problems.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.361
Sounds like a good way
of getting yourself killed.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.700
Then it's a good thing I heal fast.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.361
OLIVER: Vince.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.623
May I speak with you, please?

11:57.508 --> 11:59.875
Ms. Queen, I'm telling you,
there is nothing liquid.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.968
And we have no way
of borrowing capital.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.671
Jake, that's just
not gonna work for us,

12:03.765 --> 12:07.930
so I need you to try
to find more money.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.430
I might be able to pull
a few hundred thousand but...

12:12.523 --> 12:15.061
That's not gonna be enough money
for Cayden James,

12:15.151 --> 12:17.734
so I just... I need you to try
and find some more.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.910
Sorry, sometimes he just needs to be
pushed a little bit.

12:28.998 --> 12:29.988
Quentin, what's up?

12:30.625 --> 12:31.957
She's been following me.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.579
- Laurel?
- Yeah.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.411
It started a couple of days ago.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.212
Okay, have you talked to her?

12:37.715 --> 12:38.876
Not quite.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.428
Every time I turn around,
she disappears.

12:44.639 --> 12:45.720
THEA: What do you think it means?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.431
I think maybe we made
some kind of connection.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.679
She wants to reach out,

12:50.812 --> 12:51.802
but she's afraid.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.638
- Does that sound crazy?
- No.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.225
Not after everything
we've seen lately, no.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.692
So what do we do?

12:59.779 --> 13:03.113
If it seems like she's trying
to reach out to you, then...

13:04.701 --> 13:06.442
I don't know, maybe we
just gotta find a way

13:06.536 --> 13:08.869
for you to reach out to her.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.036
VINCE: What's on your mind?

13:17.422 --> 13:19.664
OLIVER: Dinah, Curtis
and Rene trust you.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.165
I'm not there yet.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.343
I want you to try to imagine
how little I give a damn.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.052
You've taken a shot at me.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.802
Matter of fact,
you've taken a shot

13:28.891 --> 13:30.598
at nearly everybody in that room,

13:30.685 --> 13:33.769
so I will be convinced
that you're not playing us,

13:33.855 --> 13:36.848
the way that you claim
to be playing Cayden James.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.516
I don't have to convince you.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.394
Because you're not stopping me
from doing this.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.563
- Are you sure?
- I am.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.738
Because you know saving this city
means doing whatever's necessary.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.495
And you know that means using me.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.045
Did Oliver push you to do this?

14:05.887 --> 14:07.970
He didn't have to, D.
It's the right play.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.640
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.301
I'm not so sure.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.261
Something just doesn't feel right.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.813
You know, the same way it did for you
when everything went bad with Sonus.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.310
That was my call, D.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.936
Don't you wear that guilt.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.310
I don't wanna lose you again.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.195
I'm so happy to hear that.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.029
And you won't.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.624
Aces and queens.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.709
Got me.

14:44.050 --> 14:47.760
And you are in the black, barely.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.177
Thanks.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.348
Yeah, this cash inflow coming
from San Francisco is huge,

14:52.433 --> 14:53.640
but it wasn't very efficient.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.135
You know, if I knew more I might be
able to maximize revenue stream.

14:58.564 --> 15:02.228
Sorry. I know I'm not supposed
to ask specifics.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.981
Just... We need a little more of it,
that's all I'm saying.

15:05.196 --> 15:06.903
I'll take that under advisement.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.489
All right.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.818
Well, I'm going to go home
for the night.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.161
Good night, boys.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.335
I'll walk with you. (GRUNTS)

15:21.421 --> 15:24.209
Can't let a lady walk home alone, hmm?

15:27.593 --> 15:30.381
That was subtle.
What, you didn't have a neon sign?

15:30.471 --> 15:32.588
It's fine, no one noticed.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.555
So what did his book say?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.226
He's got a boatload
of money floating around

15:42.316 --> 15:43.306
neither of us have eyes on.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.357
And seriously, Vince,
Sonus should not see us together.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.276
They all think I'm just trying
to get in your pants.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.691
Hmm.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.447
Well, if only wishing made it so.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.372
CURTIS: Nice.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.042
Love what you guys haven't done
with the place.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.217
Let's get this over with.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.216
We turned your room into a home gym,
because...

16:14.932 --> 16:16.298
'Cause this extremely
awkward situation

16:16.392 --> 16:17.883
needs to be masked with humor.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.390
I think what she means to say is,
welcome back.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.805
We have the inside man,
you have the tech.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.773
It's the only reason
we're back, hoss.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.814
- Is Vince on site?
- Should be, as of five minutes ago.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.646
That is, if everything
goes according to plan.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.656
You sound like it might not.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.608
Vince said he doesn't have access
to the server room,

16:34.702 --> 16:35.692
so if anyone spots him in there,

16:35.786 --> 16:36.947
he's gonna have
a lot of explaining to do.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.074
We've got eyes.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.529
- DINAH DRAKE: Can I talk to him?
- Yeah.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.419
Frack.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.465
I think we need to talk.

No, but Mr. Sheck did.

He was a little more loose-lipped
then you'd like.

18:01.664 --> 18:02.780
Rest in peace.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.953
Still, it doesn't explain
what exactly you're doing in here.

- Dinah, not yet.

repeat exactly what I say.

- "You think just..."
- ...because I can handle a gun,

18:18.723 --> 18:20.430
doesn't mean I know
the difference between

18:24.604 --> 18:25.890

18:26.522 --> 18:29.936
I wanted to know how you maximize
the data through-put.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.979
Sorry.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.814
I should have asked first.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.442
Perhaps.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.199
I may have underestimated you.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.701
It seems that you have more skill
than I gave you credit for.

I'm more than just a pretty face.

Keep him talking, we're at 80%.

18:52.548 --> 18:56.258
Funny thing is,
I underestimated you, too.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.626
Is that right?

When you recruited me to help you
take this city from Oliver Queen,

19:01.849 --> 19:03.431
I didn't think you'd have
the resolve to do

19:03.517 --> 19:05.679
what was necessary
to make him fear you.

19:07.355 --> 19:08.516
I was wrong.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.140
Does that mean
that you also fear me, Mr. Sobel?

is which one of us is made.

No, baby.
If Sonus knew anything at all,

Whoever doctored this
leaked that photo.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.309
To make James think
you killed his son.

38:42.403 --> 38:45.146
Whoever planned this,
knew exactly how Cayden would react.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.902
Which means that person
has to be close to Cayden.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.027
If that's true,

38:49.035 --> 38:51.618
Vince wasn't the only traitor
that Cayden has to worry about.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.415
- (DOOR OPENS)
- (CHUCKLES)

39:01.923 --> 39:02.913
QUENTIN: Hey.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.174
You know what?
Laurel, she needs to see this. Right?

39:05.426 --> 39:06.416
'Cause the video worked,

39:06.511 --> 39:08.594
it got through to her a little bit,
but this is gonna...

39:10.223 --> 39:11.304
What is it? You all right?

39:11.850 --> 39:14.217
I think we might've been wrong
about Laurel.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.597
What are you talking about?

39:16.688 --> 39:17.678
Felicity just called.

39:18.523 --> 39:21.266
Dinah's former partner,
her boyfriend...

39:21.526 --> 39:22.516
Right.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.190
- He's dead.
- Oh...

39:25.280 --> 39:29.695
And Laurel killed him.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.574
I know how badly
you want to believe in this,

39:34.664 --> 39:37.156
(INHALES SHARPLY)
and believe in her and then...

39:37.792 --> 39:40.375
Seriously, Quentin, I really do, too.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.586
I'm so sorry.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.764
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

40:19.208 --> 40:20.449
You shouldn't be here.

40:20.627 --> 40:22.459
Dinah, please give me
a chance to explain.

40:22.545 --> 40:26.129
You lost that right when you decided
to leave Vince on his own to die.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.548
I'm truly sorry about
what happened to Vince.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.676
Because I know what he meant to you.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.054
But this was his call.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.341
And he knew what he signed up for.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.470
(SCOFFS)

40:39.312 --> 40:41.304
Wow, you are really bad at apologies.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.854
I'm not here to apologize.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.445
Of course you're not.

40:54.535 --> 40:57.027
I'm here to explain that...

40:57.956 --> 40:59.697
This wasn't all for nothing.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.617
Felicity's been going through
the data that Vince pulled out.

41:02.710 --> 41:07.501
And for the first time...
Dinah, for the first time...

41:08.633 --> 41:11.717
- We have some viable options.
- "Viable options"?

41:12.512 --> 41:13.548
You know, I used to tell Vince

41:13.638 --> 41:16.005
his way of seeking justice
wasn't "viable."

41:17.850 --> 41:19.637
I convinced him to change.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.018
Just how you convinced me.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.479
But you know what, Oliver?

41:27.151 --> 41:28.267
Vince was right.

41:30.863 --> 41:34.027
The only way to bring justice
to this city is with a bullet.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.240
No. Dinah...

41:36.327 --> 41:38.364
I need you to listen to me.

41:38.454 --> 41:41.071
I'm going to make sure
Vince didn't die for nothing.

41:42.959 --> 41:45.747
I'm going to kill
every last one of them.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.042
Starting with Laurel.

42:22.999 --> 42:23.989
