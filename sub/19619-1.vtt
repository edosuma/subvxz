01:43.802 --> 01:47.739
Hey, this is Anne.
Leave a message.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.542
Hey, it's me.

01:49.575 --> 01:51.543
Going to be a bit late
getting to the cabin.

01:51.576 --> 01:54.379
I got a little turned
around, and I'm

01:54.412 --> 01:55.980
going to need to
backtrack a bit.

01:56.013 --> 01:57.048
Stupid, I know, but...

02:37.155 --> 02:38.023
Hello?

02:46.899 --> 02:50.002
John, please listen to me.

02:50.035 --> 02:52.838
You're in terrible danger.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.041
John.

03:22.468 --> 03:22.901
Stay away.

03:44.589 --> 03:47.992
I had the strangest dream.

03:48.025 --> 03:51.463
I was driving to the cabin.

03:51.496 --> 03:52.797
Somehow I got lost.

03:52.831 --> 03:53.632
And then I...

03:56.501 --> 03:58.870
Anne?

03:58.904 --> 03:59.772
Anne.

04:12.851 --> 04:13.719
Anne?

04:22.127 --> 04:22.995
Annie.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.130
Hello, John.

04:59.163 --> 05:01.033
I have your wife.

05:01.065 --> 05:04.102
If you want to see her
again, do exactly as I say.

05:10.393 --> 05:15.055
<b>DUSK</b>

05:15.953 --> 05:18.953
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

05:38.202 --> 05:39.804
Have you seen Sam?

05:39.837 --> 05:41.205
What?

05:41.238 --> 05:44.876
Sam Rigsby, the guy
throwing this... never mind.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.579
John, holy shit, you made it.

05:47.613 --> 05:48.747
Nice costume.

05:48.779 --> 05:50.349
Let me guess...
Electrical engineer?

05:50.382 --> 05:51.917
Mammogram machine.

05:51.950 --> 05:52.885
Not bad?

05:52.918 --> 05:54.119
I'm offering free exams!

05:54.151 --> 05:55.654
Fuck you, Rigsby!

05:55.687 --> 05:56.922
To takers yet, though.

05:56.954 --> 05:58.623
Maybe I should have
been a gynecologist.

05:58.656 --> 05:59.123
Maybe.

05:59.156 --> 06:00.291
Shit!

06:00.325 --> 06:01.993
Nice crowd, Sam.

06:02.026 --> 06:03.329
Who the hell are
all these people?

06:03.361 --> 06:05.229
No shit, right?

06:05.262 --> 06:06.998
Haven't seen you all week.

06:07.031 --> 06:08.866
Surprised your dick of a boss
let you have the night off.

06:08.899 --> 06:11.703
How's the... watcha-call-it?

06:11.736 --> 06:12.337
The install.

06:12.370 --> 06:13.171
Yeah, the install.

06:13.204 --> 06:13.938
How's that going?

06:13.971 --> 06:14.673
It's a disaster.

06:14.705 --> 06:15.673
Hey, Rigsby!

06:15.707 --> 06:16.675
Someone puked in here, man!

06:16.707 --> 06:17.675
Shit.

06:17.709 --> 06:18.644
All right.

06:18.676 --> 06:20.044
Work tonight can suck it!

06:20.077 --> 06:20.678
Yeah.

06:20.712 --> 06:21.113
OK?

06:21.146 --> 06:21.814
Yeah.

06:21.846 --> 06:22.313
You got it?

06:22.346 --> 06:23.214
All right.

06:23.248 --> 06:24.349
Don't go far, all right?

06:24.382 --> 06:25.618
I got somebody I
want you to meet.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.019
No, Sam.

06:27.051 --> 06:29.988
Sam!

06:30.022 --> 06:30.822
Here you go.

06:30.856 --> 06:32.391
Sorry about that.

06:32.423 --> 06:34.993
Yeah, this'll be fun.

06:42.967 --> 06:43.835
Here.

06:46.370 --> 06:47.272
Thanks.

06:47.305 --> 06:47.940
Cheers.

06:47.973 --> 06:48.841
Cheers.

06:51.075 --> 06:52.877
You supposed to be a
salesman or something?

06:52.911 --> 06:54.780
Electrical engineer.

06:54.812 --> 06:57.281
That's terrifying.

06:57.315 --> 06:58.416
Yeah.

06:58.450 --> 07:00.019
I would have
dressed up if I knew

07:00.051 --> 07:01.953
I was going to be the only
idiot without a costume.

07:01.986 --> 07:02.887
I'm messing with you.

07:02.921 --> 07:03.355
I know.

07:03.387 --> 07:05.024
OK.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.692
I'm Anne.

07:06.724 --> 07:07.692
John.

07:07.726 --> 07:08.993
I know.

07:09.026 --> 07:10.361
Sam actually already
told me all about you.

07:10.394 --> 07:12.664
Stories about
you guys growing up.

07:12.697 --> 07:13.865
Jeez.

07:13.899 --> 07:15.134
Don't believe half of them.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.401
How do you know Sam?

07:16.435 --> 07:18.137
I work at the Oak Tavern.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.705
Sam's a regular there.

07:19.738 --> 07:21.173
So he gets a couple beers
and then the stories

07:21.205 --> 07:22.040
come pouring out.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.075
Everyone loves it.

07:23.108 --> 07:24.977
Yeah, I'm sure.

07:25.010 --> 07:26.879
How full of shit is Sam really?

07:26.911 --> 07:28.212
Heh.

07:28.245 --> 07:30.916
Well, you see with Sam,
everything's 20% truth

07:30.949 --> 07:33.252
and 80% exaggerated bullshit.

07:34.252 --> 07:35.120
That's a lot of bullshit.

07:35.152 --> 07:36.220
The math doesn't lie.

07:36.253 --> 07:37.989
Impressive.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.993
Well, Sam did stay that
you're a great guy.

07:41.026 --> 07:42.761
So hopefully that's
part of the 20%.

07:43.894 --> 07:46.464
I see you two met already.

07:46.498 --> 07:48.067
Howdy, cowgirl.

07:48.099 --> 07:49.367
Free breast exam?

07:49.401 --> 07:50.469
I'll be gentle, I swear.

07:50.502 --> 07:52.071
Sam.

07:52.103 --> 07:53.438
This asshole's not talking
about the amazing world

07:53.471 --> 07:55.173
of engineering, is he?

07:55.207 --> 07:58.711
You holler if he starts talking
about schematics and shit.

07:58.743 --> 07:59.877
Schematics and shit?

07:59.911 --> 08:01.113
Schematics

08:01.146 --> 08:02.781
You're such a dick.

08:02.813 --> 08:04.849
Don't you have, like, an
exam to tend to or something?

08:06.517 --> 08:07.285
Good idea.

08:08.853 --> 08:11.223
Nice.

08:11.255 --> 08:16.728
Hey, want to get out
of here, go for a walk?

08:16.762 --> 08:18.397
Yeah.

08:18.430 --> 08:19.364
Hold it, you two.

08:20.264 --> 08:20.966
It's picture time.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.210
Hello, John.

08:32.243 --> 08:33.878
I have your wife.

08:33.910 --> 08:36.748
Annie!

08:36.780 --> 08:38.783
Do not call the police.

08:38.816 --> 08:42.153
If you do, you'll never
see your wife again.

08:42.186 --> 08:45.757
In your closet, there's a
safe with your savings in it.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.993
Take that money and
put it in a bag.

08:49.026 --> 08:51.863
I took your pistol,
the shotgun too.

08:51.897 --> 08:54.398
I know you better than
you know yourself, John.

08:54.431 --> 08:56.502
I will always be one
step ahead of you.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.772
And if you're listening
to this, then you really

08:59.805 --> 09:01.373
are in the dark.

09:01.406 --> 09:02.274
Fuck!

09:09.381 --> 09:10.249
A dancer?

09:14.886 --> 09:17.189
A dancer?

09:17.222 --> 09:18.190
Like the ballet?

09:18.223 --> 09:19.424
Yep.

09:19.456 --> 09:20.558
I was in New York for a bit.

09:20.592 --> 09:21.794
But that was a while ago.

09:21.826 --> 09:22.527
What happened?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.262
Just family stuff.

09:24.296 --> 09:25.930
I had to come back here, help
out my parents, you know.

09:25.964 --> 09:27.465
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:27.498 --> 09:28.499
No, it's fine.

09:28.532 --> 09:30.101
I actually... I don't regret it.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.170
I'm really... really happy
where I am right now.

09:32.204 --> 09:33.805
Yeah?

09:33.839 --> 09:37.542
You don't believe in making
a plan, sticking to it?

09:37.575 --> 09:39.978
You don't like surprises?

09:40.011 --> 09:41.914
I guess I like knowing
what's around the bend.

09:44.616 --> 09:45.951
You think that's stupid.

09:45.983 --> 09:47.151
I don't think it's stupid.

09:47.185 --> 09:48.453
Yeah, your look said it all.

09:51.323 --> 09:52.291
OK.

09:52.324 --> 09:54.425
Enlighten me.

09:54.459 --> 09:58.863
OK.

09:58.897 --> 10:01.967
I guess... I guess
the way I see it,

10:01.999 --> 10:03.434
when I wake up in
the morning, there's

10:03.468 --> 10:04.870
what I want to do that day.

10:04.902 --> 10:07.572
And there's what
life has in store.

10:07.605 --> 10:11.175
And the two hardly
ever seem to match up.

10:11.209 --> 10:14.112
I guess the one thing
you can really count on

10:14.145 --> 10:17.449
is that, you can't
count on anything.

10:17.482 --> 10:20.552
For certain, that is.

10:20.584 --> 10:24.055
That's pretty
insightful, kinda bleak.

10:24.089 --> 10:27.124
It's kind of beautiful
in its own way.

10:27.157 --> 10:28.426
Where'd you learn that?

10:28.459 --> 10:30.394
My mom.

10:30.427 --> 10:33.965
She... she passed away.

10:33.998 --> 10:36.435
Gotta live life
while you can, right?

10:36.468 --> 10:37.336
Fair enough.

10:40.238 --> 10:41.239
What about you, though?

10:41.272 --> 10:42.541
I'm, like, talking about myself.

10:42.574 --> 10:44.008
What about your folks?

10:44.041 --> 10:47.579
My dad passed
away a while ago.

10:47.612 --> 10:49.414
Mom lives a few hours up north.

10:49.446 --> 10:51.182
I see her from time to time.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.320
That's it, really.

10:56.353 --> 10:58.089
Yeah, I don't know.

10:58.123 --> 10:59.892
I guess his death just didn't
have the same kind of effect

10:59.925 --> 11:02.261
on me.

11:02.294 --> 11:03.195
Fair enough.

11:17.642 --> 11:19.176
No, it was really fun for me.

11:19.209 --> 11:22.446
I just like being around
people and... yeah, I mean,

11:22.479 --> 11:23.581
I'm... heh-heh.

11:23.614 --> 11:25.182
I have no.

11:25.215 --> 11:26.118
Yeah.

11:26.151 --> 11:27.386
Yeah, we did.

11:27.419 --> 11:29.488
We had some crazy
times there, for sure.

11:35.660 --> 11:37.329
Jeez.

11:37.362 --> 11:38.630
You're the guy my mom wanted
me to date in high school.

12:19.503 --> 12:21.005
Focus, John.

12:21.039 --> 12:22.741
If you want to see
your wife again,

12:22.773 --> 12:24.575
you need to stay focused.

12:24.608 --> 12:26.143
Remember that.

12:26.176 --> 12:27.745
Once you've collected
the money, you

12:27.778 --> 12:29.613
will call a man named David.

12:29.647 --> 12:32.450
His number is on the
back of this player.

12:32.483 --> 12:37.022
Do not call anyone
else, just David.

12:37.055 --> 12:38.323
Tell him to take
you to the cabin

12:38.355 --> 12:40.325
that you and Anne own,
near Lake Taynoka.

12:45.296 --> 12:47.265
Yeah.

12:53.637 --> 12:57.142
Lean back and just...

12:58.575 --> 12:59.543
You're done this before.

12:59.576 --> 13:00.445
I sure have.

13:09.086 --> 13:11.689
I'm gonna go out on
a limb here and say

13:11.723 --> 13:14.392
it doesn't look like we're gonna
be catching any monster trout.

13:14.425 --> 13:15.794
You'd be surprised.

13:15.826 --> 13:18.362
My dad caught a 2-foot
catfish right there.

13:18.396 --> 13:20.332
Are you serious?

13:20.364 --> 13:20.765
No.

13:20.799 --> 13:21.533
Jerk.

13:23.368 --> 13:25.804
We can go for a hike
instead if you want.

13:25.836 --> 13:27.138
No, I like it here.

13:27.171 --> 13:28.806
It's peaceful.

13:28.839 --> 13:30.776
Yeah, it is.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.178
You know, my dad, he
actually built the cabin.

13:33.210 --> 13:34.579
Cut the logs for
it and everything.

13:34.612 --> 13:37.049
That's impressive.

13:37.081 --> 13:39.383
I think your dad and my dad
would have gotten along really

13:39.416 --> 13:40.285
well.

13:42.420 --> 13:43.288
Yeah, probably.

13:50.295 --> 13:52.564
He has his own way of doing
things, John, you know?

13:52.597 --> 13:54.766
Yeah, he certainly does.

13:54.799 --> 13:56.401
Will you relax?

13:56.434 --> 13:58.136
He's hard on every guy I've
ever introduced him to.

13:58.169 --> 14:00.072
He's just overprotective.

14:00.104 --> 14:02.606
He's a dad, you know?

14:02.640 --> 14:05.110
I actually thought he
went kind of easy on you.

14:05.142 --> 14:06.143
You call that easy?

14:06.176 --> 14:07.245
You got to be kidding me.

14:10.114 --> 14:12.249
You two will hit it off
better next time, I'm sure.

14:12.282 --> 14:14.219
Yeah, well, maybe next
time he won't act like he

14:14.252 --> 14:15.487
wants to put his boot up my ass.

14:21.658 --> 14:23.294
When did I meet you, John.

14:23.328 --> 14:24.529
About two months ago, sir.

14:24.561 --> 14:26.531
Two months?

14:26.564 --> 14:30.235
Hardly enough time to get to
know a man, wouldn't you say?

14:30.267 --> 14:31.702
Mr. Schultz, if I
could just take a...

14:31.735 --> 14:33.537
Charlie, check the
oil on that thing.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.239
'K.

14:35.272 --> 14:36.807
Truth be told, I don't much
recall what you and I even

14:36.840 --> 14:38.810
talked about last
time you visited.

14:38.843 --> 14:42.848
Well, sir, we've met a few
times in between, if you recall.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.283
Here, hold this.

14:45.315 --> 14:45.716
OK.

14:45.749 --> 14:47.651
Come on.

14:47.685 --> 14:48.587
Give it here, Charlie.

14:53.590 --> 14:56.260
Two months.

14:56.294 --> 14:57.796
Two months and here
you are asking me

14:57.829 --> 15:00.364
to give away my only daughter.

15:00.397 --> 15:01.266
Yes, sir.

15:04.536 --> 15:06.470
Charlie, take that
in the garage.

15:06.503 --> 15:07.672
I'll take a look at it later on.

15:10.941 --> 15:13.344
Tell me something, John.

15:13.377 --> 15:16.214
What kind of man are you?

15:16.247 --> 15:16.882
Sir?

15:16.915 --> 15:17.716
Come inside.

15:40.405 --> 15:43.208
Five years ago,
my wife... God rest

15:43.241 --> 15:46.478
her soul... got sick, real sick.

15:46.511 --> 15:48.213
Anne told me.

15:48.246 --> 15:48.914
I'm sorry.

15:51.616 --> 15:54.719
Anne put her dancing,
her dreams, on hold

15:54.752 --> 15:58.256
so she could come home and
help take care of her mom...

15:58.289 --> 16:00.358
And me, for that matter.

16:00.391 --> 16:04.829
She wanted to be here because
that's the way we raised her.

16:04.862 --> 16:09.233
Well, after the worst year of
my life, Sara finally passed.

16:09.267 --> 16:11.236
She was a good woman.

16:11.268 --> 16:13.270
Had a good heart.

16:13.304 --> 16:15.273
And she died young.

16:15.305 --> 16:16.708
Why?

16:16.741 --> 16:18.610
Only God knows.

16:18.642 --> 16:22.214
You don't plan for
these kinds of things.

16:22.247 --> 16:26.218
My point is, John,
life isn't fair.

16:26.251 --> 16:28.587
One day you think you've got
all the time in the world.

16:28.619 --> 16:31.922
Then you blink and
death comes knocking.

16:31.955 --> 16:34.658
Life doesn't give a
damn what you want.

16:34.691 --> 16:38.296
My question is, when
the going gets tough...

16:38.329 --> 16:41.900
And it will... how do I know
you're not just going to up

16:41.932 --> 16:43.467
and walk out on my little girl?

16:51.008 --> 16:54.613
Mr. Schultz, I love Anne.

16:54.646 --> 16:55.814
I'd die for her.

17:06.590 --> 17:07.925
Once you've collected
the money, you

17:07.959 --> 17:11.595
will call a man named David.

17:11.628 --> 17:13.498
Be careful with David.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.598
He is unstable, violent.

17:15.632 --> 17:18.269
Do not push him.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.906
Most importantly, David does
not know I have your wife.

17:21.939 --> 17:24.409
I told him to take
you to the cabin.

17:24.441 --> 17:25.675
That's all he knows.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.945
He does what I tell him.

17:27.978 --> 17:30.015
Remember how much you
love your life, John.

17:30.047 --> 17:32.816
Remember how much
she means to you.

17:32.850 --> 17:35.420
Remember this, and you
will see her again.

17:35.452 --> 17:38.389
You have until midnight
tonight to get me my money.

17:38.422 --> 17:39.391
Now get moving.

17:46.663 --> 17:48.499
Shit, man.

17:48.533 --> 17:49.534
Seriously?

17:49.566 --> 17:50.567
Jesus, that didn't take long.

17:50.601 --> 17:51.936
Yeah, six months.

17:51.969 --> 17:53.971
Did you... did you
buy a ring and all?

17:54.005 --> 17:55.739
Yeah.

17:55.773 --> 17:58.642
Yeah, gonna have to ask Roger
for a raise after buying it.

17:58.676 --> 18:00.011
And her old man?

18:00.044 --> 18:01.780
Mr. Bucket-o-Sunshine himself?

18:01.813 --> 18:03.448
What did he say?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.849
Technically speaking, he
hasn't given me permission yet.

18:05.882 --> 18:07.451
But we talked.

18:07.485 --> 18:08.086
You talked?

18:08.119 --> 18:08.853
He talked.

18:08.885 --> 18:10.454
I listened.

18:10.488 --> 18:14.426
Are you... you sure about this?

18:14.459 --> 18:15.826
Anne makes me...

18:20.898 --> 18:23.001
Yeah, I'm sure.

18:25.001 --> 18:29.873
Johnny boy, congrats.

18:29.907 --> 18:32.977
Thanks, Sam.

18:33.009 --> 18:36.714
I wouldn't have met Anne
if it wasn't for you.

18:36.748 --> 18:42.953
So it seems fitting you
should be my best man, right?

18:44.956 --> 18:46.491
Yeah.

18:46.524 --> 18:47.825
Shit, yeah.

18:47.859 --> 18:49.828
Yeah, you got it, brother.

18:49.861 --> 18:50.795
Yeah.

18:50.827 --> 18:52.363
Come here, man.

18:52.396 --> 18:53.097
Come here.

18:56.167 --> 18:58.103
Hey, everybody.

18:58.135 --> 19:00.971
This son of a bitch
is getting married.

19:01.005 --> 19:02.474
Drinks are on him!

21:50.740 --> 21:54.112
You have until midnight
tonight to get me my money.

21:54.144 --> 21:55.046
Now get moving.

22:04.588 --> 22:05.256
Jesus.

22:39.890 --> 22:40.758
No!

22:45.261 --> 22:47.264
Do not call the police.

22:47.297 --> 22:50.101
If you do, you'll never
see your wife again.

22:50.133 --> 22:54.104
I will always be one
step ahead of you.

22:54.138 --> 22:56.841
You will call a man named David.

22:56.873 --> 23:00.277
Tell him to take you to the
cabin that you and Anne own.

23:00.311 --> 23:01.879
Be careful with David.

23:01.911 --> 23:04.248
He is unstable, violent.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.249
Do not push him.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.132
You can't do this, John.

23:21.164 --> 23:22.132
You can't.

23:22.165 --> 23:23.033
You're gonna get her killed.

23:23.066 --> 23:23.934
You realize that, right?

23:38.149 --> 23:42.754
911, what is your emergency?

23:42.786 --> 23:45.055
Hello?

23:45.088 --> 23:47.357
Hello?

23:47.391 --> 23:48.993
Hello, can you hear me?

23:49.026 --> 23:49.994
Hello?

23:50.026 --> 23:51.962
Is anyone there?

23:51.996 --> 23:52.964
Hello?

23:55.966 --> 23:57.267
John?

23:57.301 --> 23:58.302
Hey.

23:58.334 --> 23:59.303
Sorry.

23:59.335 --> 24:00.837
Big day, right?

24:02.405 --> 24:04.975
The pastor says we're going
to start in about 20 or so.

24:05.008 --> 24:05.977
Got it.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.081
I got to go wrangle up the guys.

24:10.113 --> 24:11.082
See you in a bit?

24:11.114 --> 24:12.083
Yeah.

24:12.115 --> 24:13.750
Hey, Sam.

24:13.784 --> 24:16.286
Thanks.

24:16.319 --> 24:16.921
Sir.

24:16.953 --> 24:17.788
Sam.

24:21.892 --> 24:23.294
Nervous?

24:23.326 --> 24:24.996
That obvious?

24:25.028 --> 24:25.762
Relax.

24:25.796 --> 24:27.030
You'll do fine.

24:27.064 --> 24:30.468
I'm sorry your father
couldn't be here.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.436
Thank you.

24:32.469 --> 24:33.904
Talk to Anne?

24:33.938 --> 24:35.105
Everything OK?

24:35.139 --> 24:36.908
Yes.

24:36.940 --> 24:40.077
I'm glad she decided to wear
her mom's wedding dress.

24:40.111 --> 24:42.412
But looking at her
standing there,

24:42.446 --> 24:44.449
she looks so much like her mom.

24:44.481 --> 24:46.151
For a second, I thought
I was looking at...

24:48.919 --> 24:51.322
I'm sure she looks gorgeous.

24:51.354 --> 24:53.024
Yes.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.124
Yes, she does.

24:56.293 --> 24:58.429
Looks like we're getting ready.

24:58.461 --> 25:03.500
John, after today, Anne's going
to be your responsibility.

25:03.534 --> 25:05.069
I don't know what
I would have done

25:05.102 --> 25:06.871
if she hadn't have been there.

25:06.903 --> 25:11.007
Now, promise me you'll
make her happy, that you'll

25:11.040 --> 25:13.376
keep her safe no matter what.

25:13.410 --> 25:14.344
You have my word.

25:18.348 --> 25:24.788
So does this mean you're
giving me your permission, sir?

25:24.822 --> 25:27.225
Yes.

25:27.257 --> 25:28.759
Thanks.

25:28.793 --> 25:30.527
Yeah, now let's get in
there before Sam beds

25:30.561 --> 25:31.796
one of the bridesmaids.

25:31.828 --> 25:33.764
Probably too late for that.

25:38.501 --> 25:39.369
Hello?

25:41.805 --> 25:42.340
Hello?

25:42.373 --> 25:44.941
Are you there?

25:44.975 --> 25:46.878
If anyone can hear me, I'm se...

26:10.234 --> 26:11.102
Yeah?

26:24.547 --> 26:25.982
He knew everything.

26:26.016 --> 26:28.219
He knew about the safe,
the cabin, my gun.

26:28.251 --> 26:29.986
He must have broken
during the night.

26:30.019 --> 26:31.521
But what I can't understand
is how he got Anne out of here

26:31.555 --> 26:34.191
without a struggle, without
making a sound to wake me up.

26:34.225 --> 26:35.293
What are you talking about?

26:35.325 --> 26:36.493
He must have drugged me.

26:36.526 --> 26:37.562
Chloroform maybe.

26:37.594 --> 26:39.095
Chloroform?

26:39.129 --> 26:40.363
I don't remember a damn
thing from last night.

26:40.396 --> 26:42.332
I don't remember going to bed.

26:42.365 --> 26:43.500
Anne and I were talking.

26:43.534 --> 26:44.901
We were...

26:46.903 --> 26:47.571
We were talking about...

26:51.241 --> 26:51.942
About something.

26:56.412 --> 26:57.981
God damn it, what was it?

26:58.015 --> 26:59.283
Hold on just a second.

26:59.315 --> 27:00.852
Why wasn't anything
knocked over or broken?

27:00.884 --> 27:02.519
I mean, Anne would not
have just let this guy

27:02.553 --> 27:04.121
take her without a fight.

27:05.421 --> 27:08.124
He must have drugged her too.

27:08.158 --> 27:10.094
You think she's still alive?

27:10.126 --> 27:11.528
What the hell is
the matter with you?

27:11.562 --> 27:12.997
I'm sorry.

27:13.029 --> 27:16.166
I'm confused with what
you're telling me.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.101
We should go upstairs.

27:17.133 --> 27:18.102
I need to call somebody.

27:18.134 --> 27:18.568
Get some help.

27:18.602 --> 27:19.402
No.

27:19.436 --> 27:20.938
He said no police.

27:20.970 --> 27:22.272
Shouldn't even be
talking to you.

27:22.305 --> 27:24.208
It's a risk.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.442
I can't do this alone.

27:28.946 --> 27:31.215
Bastard's probably
watching us right now.

27:31.248 --> 27:32.115
Who?

28:08.052 --> 28:10.353
It's him... David.

28:10.386 --> 28:12.123
I made the call
before you got here.

28:12.155 --> 28:14.057
Whatever you're
thinking about doing,

28:14.091 --> 28:14.992
I can't let you do it.

28:15.025 --> 28:16.326
This isn't safe.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.228
Look, god damn it, Anne
is out there, probably

28:18.261 --> 28:20.430
tied up with this son of a
bitch doing God knows what.

28:20.463 --> 28:22.132
Now, we don't have a
lot of time here so we

28:22.165 --> 28:23.433
need you to back me up on this.

28:27.004 --> 28:29.040
He's making himself
right at home, isn't he?

28:29.073 --> 28:29.974
Wait here.

28:30.007 --> 28:30.608
Let me talk to him.

28:30.641 --> 28:31.642
No, wait.

28:31.674 --> 28:32.475
You're not supposed to be here.

28:32.508 --> 28:33.310
I need to explain.

28:33.344 --> 28:36.279
I'll work it out.

28:36.313 --> 28:37.214
Sam.

28:37.247 --> 28:39.583
What?

28:39.615 --> 28:40.484
Stay here.

29:23.293 --> 29:24.228
I will.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.196
Yes.

29:26.229 --> 29:27.163
Thanks, Roger.

29:27.197 --> 29:28.431
I'm glad it's working out.

29:28.465 --> 29:30.101
That's great to hear.

29:30.133 --> 29:33.570
I'll finish up the draft
tonight and see you first thing.

29:33.603 --> 29:35.238
Heh, that's right.

29:35.271 --> 29:38.174
We'll give the boys at
McGregor a run for their money.

29:38.208 --> 29:39.576
Great.

29:39.610 --> 29:41.579
I'll see you in the morning.

29:41.612 --> 29:42.580
Bye.

29:47.183 --> 29:48.118
OK.

29:48.151 --> 29:49.152
Let me take care of this.

30:11.475 --> 30:12.343
David.

30:21.517 --> 30:23.720
You ready?

30:23.754 --> 30:25.790
Yes.

30:25.823 --> 30:28.526
He's coming with us.

30:28.558 --> 30:30.827
I don't care.

30:30.861 --> 30:32.130
I just want to get this done.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.608
I got to piss.

30:44.641 --> 30:45.075
Make it quick.

30:48.378 --> 30:50.681
What's in the bag?

30:50.713 --> 30:51.748
Supplies.

30:51.782 --> 30:53.250
What for?

30:53.283 --> 30:54.151
In case.

31:01.557 --> 31:02.826
It's a little after 6:00.

31:02.860 --> 31:04.428
We've got until midnight.

31:04.460 --> 31:05.829
We're going to be cutting
this close, aren't we?

31:07.597 --> 31:09.700
I know you're only
doing as you're told.

31:09.732 --> 31:12.836
But I want you to know that
if anything happens to her...

31:12.870 --> 31:15.473
Anything...

31:16.840 --> 31:19.776
I'll kill you.

31:19.809 --> 31:22.779
Who?

31:22.813 --> 31:25.815
Jesus Christ, he was serious.

31:25.848 --> 31:28.184
You really don't know, do you?

31:28.218 --> 31:30.321
I'm taking you to the cabin.

31:30.353 --> 31:32.555
This better not go
bad, do you hear me?

31:34.490 --> 31:35.358
Police department.

31:35.392 --> 31:36.160
Open the door please.

31:36.192 --> 31:36.727
Shit.

31:36.759 --> 31:37.594
What the hell?

31:37.628 --> 31:38.796
You called the cops?

31:38.828 --> 31:39.496
I hung up before I
told him anything.

31:40.363 --> 31:40.864
Police department.

31:40.898 --> 31:42.333
Jesus Christ.

31:42.365 --> 31:43.468
Let me handle this.

31:48.471 --> 31:49.706
Officer.

31:49.739 --> 31:52.242
Someone from this
residence called 911?

31:52.276 --> 31:53.510
I'm afraid so.

31:53.544 --> 31:54.745
Is everything all right?

31:54.777 --> 31:56.313
What's this?

31:56.345 --> 31:57.381
Just stay put.

31:57.413 --> 31:58.815
Don't do anything.

32:02.318 --> 32:05.288
May I speak with him?

32:08.659 --> 32:09.627
Sir, everything all right?

32:14.530 --> 32:15.398
Yes.

32:20.903 --> 32:22.238
OK.

32:22.271 --> 32:23.640
You all have a safe evening.

32:23.673 --> 32:24.340
Thanks.

32:24.373 --> 32:25.242
Thank you.

32:27.878 --> 32:30.681
Well, that was interesting.

32:30.713 --> 32:32.448
What did you say to him?

32:32.481 --> 32:34.551
Don't matter.

32:34.584 --> 32:35.452
Let's go.

33:04.948 --> 33:05.815
Come on.

33:08.552 --> 33:09.920
You son of a bitch.

33:11.555 --> 33:12.488
Fuck!

33:12.521 --> 33:13.390
God!

33:15.892 --> 33:18.429
Come on, you fucking
piece of shit!

33:33.309 --> 33:34.744
That's great to hear.

33:34.777 --> 33:37.614
I'll finish up the draft
tonight and see you first thing.

33:37.648 --> 33:39.283
Heh, that's wrong.

33:39.315 --> 33:41.584
We'll give the boys at
McGregor a run for their money.

33:41.617 --> 33:43.786
Great.

33:43.819 --> 33:44.754
See you in the morning.

33:44.787 --> 33:47.490
Bye.

33:47.524 --> 33:48.659
Hey, when did you get in?

33:48.691 --> 33:50.627
Just now.

33:50.661 --> 33:52.863
Another all-nighter?

33:52.895 --> 33:54.964
It's going through, my design.

33:54.998 --> 33:56.734
It was just approved
by the board.

33:56.767 --> 33:59.603
Passed their test with flying
colors, is what Roger said.

33:59.635 --> 34:02.005
That's... that's great.

34:02.038 --> 34:04.307
15 revisions and not a peep.

34:04.341 --> 34:06.310
And then all of a sudden this.

34:06.343 --> 34:07.945
They must've been doing
the tests off-site.

34:07.978 --> 34:10.380
I gotta tell you, I was
worried for a bit there.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.697
What's wrong?

34:27.730 --> 34:28.598
Anne?

34:32.735 --> 34:33.571
Annie, what is it?

37:07.591 --> 37:09.192
You OK?

37:09.225 --> 37:10.693
This is him.

37:10.727 --> 37:14.031
This is... this is the
guy that took Anne.

37:14.064 --> 37:15.466
I've seen him before.

37:22.906 --> 37:23.774
Somewhere.

37:26.209 --> 37:28.879
Somehow... somehow
I know this man.

37:28.911 --> 37:29.814
Take it easy.

38:14.623 --> 38:16.993
This doesn't make any sense.

38:17.027 --> 38:17.961
What?

38:17.993 --> 38:19.262
This plan.

38:19.296 --> 38:21.698
Why didn't he just
wake me up last night,

38:21.730 --> 38:23.966
stick a gun in my face,
and make me open the safe?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.268
Why all this?

38:25.301 --> 38:27.703
Plus, we've both seen
David's face, right?

38:27.736 --> 38:29.171
We know his name.

38:29.205 --> 38:32.142
As soon as we get to the
cabin, we're as good as dead.

38:32.174 --> 38:33.743
God, I just hope Anne is still...

38:37.013 --> 38:39.583
OK.

38:39.616 --> 38:41.951
OK.

38:41.984 --> 38:46.022
When was the last time that
you talked to... to Anne?

38:46.056 --> 38:46.690
Last night.

38:46.723 --> 38:47.291
Why?

38:47.323 --> 38:48.791
Last night?

38:48.825 --> 38:49.893
Yes, last night.

38:49.926 --> 38:51.228
OK.

38:51.261 --> 38:53.997
Can you remember what
you were talking about?

38:54.029 --> 38:56.299
No, but something was wrong.

38:56.332 --> 38:57.867
What?

38:57.901 --> 38:59.703
I told you, I don't
remember a damn thing, OK?

38:59.736 --> 39:01.038
What are you getting at?

39:01.071 --> 39:02.072
You think she had
something to do with this?

39:02.105 --> 39:02.773
No.

39:02.806 --> 39:03.340
What then?

39:03.372 --> 39:04.941
I don't know.

39:04.975 --> 39:06.743
It sounded important, but
you can't what it was?

39:06.776 --> 39:08.145
Think hard.

39:08.178 --> 39:09.046
What do you remember?

39:14.116 --> 39:15.218
It was raining.

39:15.250 --> 39:17.620
I remember that.

39:17.654 --> 39:21.992
Roger... he was going to have
me pull another all-nighter.

39:22.024 --> 39:24.860
Anne was upset.

39:24.893 --> 39:28.832
Then... then... and
then that's it, OK?

39:28.864 --> 39:30.100
That's all I remember.

39:30.132 --> 39:30.968
Who's Roger?

39:36.006 --> 39:36.873
Come here.

39:46.382 --> 39:48.317
What are you doing?

40:23.719 --> 40:24.388
John.

40:26.790 --> 40:28.392
Hello?

40:28.424 --> 40:31.027
Sam?

40:31.060 --> 40:31.928
David?

40:37.734 --> 40:38.902
What the hell is going on here?

40:54.350 --> 40:57.120
Hello?

40:57.152 --> 40:59.288
Sam?

40:59.321 --> 41:00.189
David?

41:30.185 --> 41:32.122
Jesus!

41:32.154 --> 41:34.056
Stay away.

41:34.089 --> 41:34.490
Please.

41:34.524 --> 41:35.892
Please!

41:35.924 --> 41:38.361
Stay away.

41:38.393 --> 41:39.361
Who are you?

41:39.395 --> 41:43.065
They are not who you think.

41:43.098 --> 41:43.966
Who?

41:44.000 --> 41:44.968
Them!

41:46.969 --> 41:48.071
Holy shit!

41:51.808 --> 41:52.876
What the hell are you doing?

41:56.145 --> 42:01.283
I was... there was... she...

42:01.317 --> 42:03.053
Are you OK?

42:03.085 --> 42:07.089
The RV shut down
and I was... I was...

42:07.122 --> 42:07.990
Sit down.

42:11.060 --> 42:13.864
Are we supposed to take
4 or 212 through Kenton?

42:17.567 --> 42:19.102
4 or 212?

42:19.134 --> 42:24.373
12.

42:24.406 --> 42:25.207
I don't know.

42:25.241 --> 42:27.878
I don't remember.

42:27.910 --> 42:28.811
4 it is, I guess.

42:40.022 --> 42:41.423
Are you OK?

42:41.457 --> 42:43.225
I saw her.

42:43.259 --> 42:45.195
Who?

42:45.227 --> 42:46.562
A woman.

42:46.596 --> 42:48.165
A woman?

42:48.198 --> 42:49.232
Where?

42:49.265 --> 42:50.467
She told me to go back.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.103
She told me to...

42:53.136 --> 42:54.004
What?

42:57.406 --> 42:58.874
Forget it.

42:58.908 --> 42:59.476
I must have zoned out
there for a minute.

43:03.478 --> 43:05.147
What time is it?

43:05.181 --> 43:07.484
It's, quarter till 9:00.

43:07.517 --> 43:08.285
Why?

43:08.317 --> 43:09.518
No.

43:09.551 --> 43:12.454
No, it was just 7:30
just a second ago.

43:12.488 --> 43:14.024
Is that clock broken?

43:14.056 --> 43:15.125
Or maybe your watch is.

43:15.158 --> 43:16.426
My watch is fine.

43:16.459 --> 43:17.460
It's 8:45.

43:17.493 --> 43:19.496
No.

43:19.529 --> 43:21.264
What happened to the last hour?

43:21.297 --> 43:23.533
You've been here the whole time.

43:23.565 --> 43:25.035
We've been talking.

43:25.067 --> 43:27.837
Shit, you are freaking me out.

43:27.870 --> 43:29.538
Just try to relax.

43:29.571 --> 43:31.440
OK?

43:31.473 --> 43:32.341
Yeah.

44:13.216 --> 44:15.252
You don't look too good.

44:15.285 --> 44:19.321
I should have told that cop the
truth back at the house when

44:19.355 --> 44:21.892
I had the chance.

44:21.924 --> 44:24.593
Just try to get some rest, OK?

44:26.228 --> 44:28.931
How can you be so
calm about all this?

44:28.964 --> 44:30.100
I'm here to help.

44:30.132 --> 44:31.033
Do you remember?

44:43.312 --> 44:46.448
Why would he involve David?

44:46.482 --> 44:48.585
Why would David let us
see his face unless he

44:48.618 --> 44:49.652
was going to kill us anyway?

44:53.522 --> 44:54.390
No, this feels wrong.

44:58.428 --> 44:59.296
We need help.

45:06.703 --> 45:07.571
Hey.

45:09.038 --> 45:10.507
Go talk to him.

45:10.540 --> 45:11.608
About what?

45:11.640 --> 45:12.942
Keep him occupied.

45:12.975 --> 45:14.343
Tell him one of
your stupid jokes.

45:14.377 --> 45:16.947
I don't know any stupid
jokes off the top my head.

45:16.980 --> 45:20.116
Then make something up, OK?

45:20.149 --> 45:21.018
OK.

45:26.756 --> 45:27.958
What's he doing?

45:27.991 --> 45:29.025
All right, I got one for you.

45:29.058 --> 45:31.027
So three girls walk into a...

45:41.770 --> 45:42.504
Hello?

45:46.542 --> 45:47.710
For a drink.

45:47.743 --> 45:48.611
And...

45:51.247 --> 45:52.348
Hello.

45:52.381 --> 45:54.216
If you can hear
me, please answer.

45:54.250 --> 45:56.085
My name is John Whitmore.

45:56.118 --> 45:57.187
I have an emergency.

46:00.156 --> 46:01.558
Hello.

46:01.591 --> 46:04.227
Hello, John.

46:04.259 --> 46:07.363
I thought I told you not
to involve the authorities.

46:07.397 --> 46:10.433
You're forgetting
I'm in control here.

46:10.466 --> 46:11.668
How...

46:11.701 --> 46:13.303
Do you think I want
to do this, John?

46:13.335 --> 46:15.038
I'm not a monster.

46:15.071 --> 46:17.306
But I am a desperate man.

46:17.339 --> 46:18.540
Don't push me.

46:18.573 --> 46:20.476
Remember Anne.

46:20.509 --> 46:21.477
I'm sorry.

46:21.511 --> 46:23.179
Please.

46:23.212 --> 46:25.715
Just give me my money and
you'll see your wife again.

46:25.747 --> 46:27.116
I believe you.

46:27.149 --> 46:28.484
Please don't hurt her.

46:28.518 --> 46:29.486
Put Anne on.

46:29.518 --> 46:31.187
I want to know that she's OK.

46:31.219 --> 46:33.422
Don't let David
see you on the CB.

46:33.455 --> 46:34.457
Did you hear me?

46:34.489 --> 46:36.459
I... I want to talk to my wife.

46:36.491 --> 46:38.127
There's no telling
what he might do.

46:41.163 --> 46:42.031
You get it?

46:45.134 --> 46:47.570
He really doesn't know, does he?

46:47.602 --> 46:51.473
About Anne, what you're doing?

46:51.506 --> 46:52.541
David is my son.

46:55.243 --> 46:57.513
I'm sorry, David.

46:57.547 --> 46:59.049
I know this is a difficult time.

47:02.151 --> 47:03.520
Could there be a mistake?

47:03.553 --> 47:06.089
I mean, those tests are
wrong all the time, right?

47:06.122 --> 47:08.658
David.

47:08.690 --> 47:11.326
We're sure.

47:17.200 --> 47:23.705
So, now what?

47:23.739 --> 47:27.811
There are several support
groups you should look into.

47:27.843 --> 47:29.311
And another thing.

47:29.344 --> 47:31.080
I hate to bring this
up, but it's something

47:31.114 --> 47:34.084
that needs to be discussed.

47:34.116 --> 47:39.689
The financial toll of long-term
care can be substantial.

47:39.721 --> 47:41.424
There are
government-assistance programs

47:41.457 --> 47:43.859
that you should look into.

47:43.893 --> 47:45.528
They might be able to help.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.729
Right.

47:47.763 --> 47:49.531
Thanks, Doc.

47:49.564 --> 47:51.467
David.

47:51.500 --> 47:53.069
Again, I'm sorry.

48:03.779 --> 48:06.649
Hey, Dad.

48:06.681 --> 48:08.450
You ready?

48:10.386 --> 48:11.286
Yes.

48:11.319 --> 48:11.821
Let's go.

48:30.172 --> 48:32.875
That was a while back, you know?

48:32.908 --> 48:38.714
Doctor said he's...
He's on a downward slope.

48:38.747 --> 48:40.516
Whatever the fuck that means.

48:40.549 --> 48:42.551
It's really starting to take its
toll on him though, you know?

48:42.585 --> 48:45.221
He's getting worse and
worse every goddamn day.

48:45.254 --> 48:46.756
I'm sorry, hon.

48:46.788 --> 48:48.825
This is one of the last
times I remember him really

48:48.857 --> 48:50.692
being with it.

48:50.725 --> 48:53.395
He took my brother Bobby
and I hunting last winter.

48:53.428 --> 48:55.664
Bobby though, he couldn't...
He couldn't hit the side

48:55.698 --> 48:58.902
of the barn with a
shotgun 5 feet away.

48:58.935 --> 49:00.170
And your mom?

49:00.203 --> 49:02.705
She still around?

49:02.738 --> 49:03.607
No.

49:06.642 --> 49:07.877
Hey, getting old's a bitch?

49:07.910 --> 49:09.678
Amen to that.

49:09.712 --> 49:12.582
With any luck, my ass will be in
the ground by the time I'm 50.

49:12.614 --> 49:15.218
It's on the house.

49:15.250 --> 49:18.254
To life, while we're young

49:18.286 --> 49:19.689
To dying quick deaths.

49:29.832 --> 49:31.567
Fuck.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.303
You can't even die these days
without someone cleaning you

49:33.335 --> 49:33.870
out?

49:33.902 --> 49:35.238
Hey, sweet ass.

49:35.270 --> 49:37.473
I get a shot?

49:37.506 --> 49:39.709
Maybe if my poor old
daddy were dying too?

49:39.741 --> 49:41.510
That's all I've been
hearing from this guy

49:41.544 --> 49:43.712
for the last hour.

49:43.745 --> 49:46.782
Why don't you tell your dad
to die already and spare us

49:46.815 --> 49:47.517
the boredom?

50:07.370 --> 50:08.938
Sorry.

50:10.538 --> 50:14.276
David will do anything for me.

50:14.310 --> 50:16.578
How can you drag your
own son into this?

50:16.611 --> 50:18.480
Stick to the plan, John.

50:18.513 --> 50:20.382
Don't try to contact anyone.

50:20.415 --> 50:24.419
And remember, I know your next
move before you even think it.

50:24.453 --> 50:25.622
Wait.

50:25.654 --> 50:27.022
Anne told me
something last night,

50:27.056 --> 50:28.424
and I need to know what it was.

50:30.558 --> 50:31.261
Hello?

50:46.408 --> 50:49.311
What was it, Anne?

50:49.344 --> 50:51.247
What did you tell me that
was so damn important?

51:04.694 --> 51:06.629
No.

51:09.031 --> 51:09.899
What's wrong?

51:12.634 --> 51:15.004
Anne?

51:15.036 --> 51:15.939
Annie, what is it?

51:22.011 --> 51:23.480
You're gonna be a father.

51:30.819 --> 51:31.453
You're pregnant?

51:51.873 --> 51:55.410
I'm gonna be a father.

51:55.444 --> 51:59.582
I... I just thought
you'd be upset.

51:59.614 --> 52:01.450
How could I be upset?

52:01.484 --> 52:02.919
The timing.

52:02.951 --> 52:05.520
I mean, we didn't plan for
this... not now, at least.

52:05.553 --> 52:06.822
You know, I just know...

52:12.761 --> 52:14.631
This kind of changes
things, you know?

52:17.665 --> 52:20.602
It's like you said,
we can't always

52:20.636 --> 52:22.904
see what's around the bend.

52:22.937 --> 52:25.774
But it's OK.

52:25.808 --> 52:26.643
It's good.

52:29.578 --> 52:30.947
It is?

52:30.980 --> 52:31.848
It is.

52:38.853 --> 52:39.788
I love you so much.

52:39.821 --> 52:40.723
I love you.

52:45.727 --> 52:50.031
You know, I have
this crazy feeling

52:50.064 --> 52:54.569
that's it's gonna be a boy.

52:55.971 --> 52:56.840
A boy.

52:59.475 --> 53:01.810
What would we name him?

53:01.843 --> 53:07.015
Well, we could name
him after your dad.

53:12.455 --> 53:13.523
I'm gonna be a father.

53:31.172 --> 53:33.475
Something wrong?

53:33.509 --> 53:36.913
He's your father, yes?

53:36.946 --> 53:37.913
Going through my things?

53:37.946 --> 53:40.549
This man, he's your father?

53:40.582 --> 53:41.783
Yeah.

53:41.817 --> 53:44.654
He's making you do this, yes?

53:44.687 --> 53:45.888
Yes.

53:45.921 --> 53:47.890
But you don't want
to, even though you

53:47.922 --> 53:48.957
don't know what he's done.

53:48.991 --> 53:50.460
Stop saying things like that.

53:50.493 --> 53:52.527
For God's sake,
just call this off.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.062
Don't let him do
something he'll regret.

53:54.096 --> 53:59.135
My father is a sick man.

53:59.167 --> 54:01.102
He needs a lot of care
and looking after.

54:01.136 --> 54:03.873
And that type of thing
costs money, lots of it.

54:03.906 --> 54:08.143
It's the only reason why
we agreed to do this.

54:26.728 --> 54:28.531
You should call your
brother to pick you up

54:28.564 --> 54:30.165
if you're going to be drinking.

54:30.198 --> 54:32.267
It's not safe.

54:32.301 --> 54:34.504
You shouldn't be driving either.

54:34.536 --> 54:35.705
How'd you get here?

54:35.738 --> 54:38.940
I'm not completely
incapable, David.

54:38.973 --> 54:40.776
Not yet anyway.

54:40.808 --> 54:44.046
Carla called, said you
were in a fight at the bar.

54:44.078 --> 54:46.882
It's no big deal.

54:46.915 --> 54:47.683
He started it.

54:51.819 --> 54:53.955
This is not your burden, son.

54:53.989 --> 54:57.159
I have some money.

54:57.192 --> 54:59.862
It ain't enough,
and you know it.

54:59.895 --> 55:02.265
David, when a man's
facing the end,

55:02.297 --> 55:06.602
he wants to leave on
his own terms, his way.

55:06.634 --> 55:07.270
Do you understand?

55:10.906 --> 55:13.174
Yeah.

55:13.207 --> 55:14.876
I have a plan.

55:14.910 --> 55:16.312
It's a way out.

55:16.344 --> 55:18.781
I'll have to keep
some things from you.

55:18.814 --> 55:19.848
And for that, I'm sorry.

55:28.223 --> 55:30.192
What's this?

55:30.225 --> 55:33.161
There's something you
don't know, David.

55:33.194 --> 55:34.096
He has my wife.

55:39.768 --> 55:41.070
She's pregnant, OK?

55:41.102 --> 55:42.771
That's not even...

55:42.805 --> 55:44.306
Look, I wasn't supposed to
say anything, but I have to.

55:44.339 --> 55:46.341
It's not only her
life in his hands.

55:46.375 --> 55:47.176
It's our child's.

55:47.209 --> 55:48.877
Do you understand?

55:48.910 --> 55:50.745
Listen.

55:50.779 --> 55:53.683
I didn't want any of this.

55:53.716 --> 55:56.853
Then please call it off.

56:01.122 --> 56:03.358
I can't.

56:03.392 --> 56:07.196
No one can.

56:07.228 --> 56:08.997
Fuck this.

56:09.031 --> 56:10.099
I need some air.

56:10.131 --> 56:10.999
He's your father.

56:11.033 --> 56:12.268
He'll listen to you.

56:12.301 --> 56:13.303
Call it off, David.

56:24.647 --> 56:28.918
How did he know about the safe?

56:28.951 --> 56:29.852
The cabin?

56:34.355 --> 56:37.859
How does he know
so much about me?

56:37.893 --> 56:39.161
About our life?

56:42.163 --> 56:43.031
Anne?

56:46.134 --> 56:47.970
Only someone close to
me could know all this.

56:50.839 --> 56:51.373
A friend.

57:00.181 --> 57:01.049
Close friend.

57:28.343 --> 57:29.212
John.

57:32.848 --> 57:33.815
John.

57:33.848 --> 57:35.316
Who are you?

57:35.350 --> 57:37.687
Do not trust them, John.

57:40.388 --> 57:41.390
What do you want?

57:41.422 --> 57:44.426
To stop you.

57:44.460 --> 57:45.928
I don't understand.

57:45.960 --> 57:48.863
Look closer, John.

57:48.897 --> 57:51.834
Closer.

57:51.866 --> 57:52.834
Closer at what?

58:08.183 --> 58:09.052
Closer.

58:32.040 --> 58:32.909
No.

58:35.410 --> 58:36.978
No.

58:37.011 --> 58:38.346
No.

58:38.379 --> 58:39.281
Something wrong?

58:46.488 --> 58:48.457
What's wrong?

58:48.489 --> 58:50.158
You look ridiculous in that tie.

58:50.192 --> 58:51.994
Hey, it's your tie, asshole.

58:52.027 --> 58:54.296
We need to get you a real hobby.

58:54.328 --> 58:57.932
Gotta say, never saw you
getting in the financial game.

58:57.966 --> 58:59.535
Yeah, well.

58:59.567 --> 59:02.337
Got tired of watching everybody
else get their shit together.

59:02.370 --> 59:03.805
Cut me some slack?

59:03.839 --> 59:06.509
Retirement plans,
stocks, mutual funds.

59:06.542 --> 59:08.544
Does any of this stuff
make any sense to you?

59:08.576 --> 59:11.013
Well, yeah.

59:11.046 --> 59:12.013
Kind of.

59:12.047 --> 59:14.382
Heh, no.

59:14.415 --> 59:16.218
I'm learning.

59:16.250 --> 59:17.319
How much we talking?

59:17.352 --> 59:18.921
Well, how much you got saved?

59:18.953 --> 59:20.256
About $50,000 or so.

59:20.288 --> 59:21.957
Shit, man, not bad.

59:21.989 --> 59:24.026
In a savings account or...

59:24.058 --> 59:26.227
No, I keep it in a
safe in our bedroom.

59:26.261 --> 59:28.430
I don't trust those
clowns at the bank.

59:28.462 --> 59:29.832
Right.

59:29.864 --> 59:32.368
I got $80,000 stashed
in my mattress.

59:32.401 --> 59:33.268
I'm serious.

59:35.837 --> 59:37.272
Shit.

59:37.306 --> 59:38.841
OK.

59:40.274 --> 59:43.978
I hope you keep that thing
locked up at all times.

59:44.011 --> 59:44.881
Yep.

59:50.886 --> 59:53.522
Well, have a look at
those papers and let me know.

59:53.555 --> 59:55.290
I gotta run.

59:55.323 --> 59:56.191
Sure.

01:00:11.873 --> 01:00:12.408
You OK?

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.576
How could you?

01:00:14.609 --> 01:00:15.944
What?

01:00:15.977 --> 01:00:18.379
All this time,
I've been wondering

01:00:18.413 --> 01:00:24.486
how he knew every detail of my
life... about Anne, the money.

01:00:24.518 --> 01:00:26.522
Only someone really close
to me could have known.

01:00:26.555 --> 01:00:27.522
Practically a brother.

01:00:27.556 --> 01:00:29.024
Hold on.

01:00:29.056 --> 01:00:30.125
I can explain.

01:00:30.158 --> 01:00:31.527
Explain what?

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.495
How you led them to me,
told them about the safe?

01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:34.330
Who are they?

01:00:34.363 --> 01:00:35.631
All right, enough.

01:00:35.663 --> 01:00:37.165
Whatever you think you
know, you're wrong.

01:00:37.198 --> 01:00:38.533
Bullshit!

01:00:38.567 --> 01:00:41.237
I told David to play
along back at the house.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.404
We have to.

01:00:42.437 --> 01:00:43.305
Stay here.

01:00:43.337 --> 01:00:44.239
We fucking promised him!

01:00:44.272 --> 01:00:45.240
Promise is bullshit!

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:47.609
We don't have a choice.

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:50.312
You need to listen to me please.

01:00:50.344 --> 01:00:51.913
Listen to what?

01:00:51.946 --> 01:00:53.181
That you've been siding
with David the whole time?

01:00:53.214 --> 01:00:54.216
No, just wait.

01:00:54.248 --> 01:00:56.317
Our wedding all those years.

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:57.419
She's my wife, Sam!

01:00:57.451 --> 01:00:58.386
I'm your friend!

01:00:58.419 --> 01:00:59.387
How could you do this her?

01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:01.089
Wait!

01:01:01.122 --> 01:01:02.190
You wanted to know what she
had to tell me last night?

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:03.625
Well, I remember now.

01:01:03.658 --> 01:01:04.926
She's pregnant!

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.395
No, that's impossible.

01:01:06.428 --> 01:01:07.328
Who are these people?

01:01:07.361 --> 01:01:08.630
How do you know them?

01:01:08.663 --> 01:01:10.098
Who is David?

01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:11.332
He's my brother.

01:01:11.366 --> 01:01:12.434
Bullshit, Sam.

01:01:12.466 --> 01:01:13.468
You don't have a brother.

01:01:13.502 --> 01:01:15.070
He is!

01:01:15.102 --> 01:01:16.671
I've known you since high
school, you lying prick.

01:01:16.705 --> 01:01:19.275
You're trying to tell him you've
had a brother this whole time?

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.509
Was it you?

01:01:20.542 --> 01:01:22.111
How did you get her
out of the house?

01:01:22.143 --> 01:01:24.013
Is she still alive, Sam?

01:01:24.046 --> 01:01:26.415
Stop calling me Sam!

01:01:26.448 --> 01:01:27.650
What?

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:28.985
My name is not Sam.

01:01:32.053 --> 01:01:33.488
You have no idea
what's going, do you?

01:01:33.522 --> 01:01:35.257
Just tell me the truth!

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:37.660
I can't!

01:01:37.692 --> 01:01:40.129
I promised you I wouldn't.

01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:42.163
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:01:42.196 --> 01:01:44.265
I swore to you.

01:01:44.299 --> 01:01:45.234
Fuck!

01:01:45.267 --> 01:01:46.368
What the hell is going on?

01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:47.268
He's out of control.

01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:48.303
Who in the hell are you?

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.471
You, outside now.

01:01:49.504 --> 01:01:50.506
We have to go back.

01:01:50.538 --> 01:01:51.674
This whole thing was a bad idea.

01:01:51.707 --> 01:01:52.975
No, no, no, he'll kill her.

01:01:53.007 --> 01:01:55.310
Stay put!

01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:03.451
Come in.

01:02:03.484 --> 01:02:04.687
It's getting late, John.

01:02:04.719 --> 01:02:06.221
I hope you're close.

01:02:06.254 --> 01:02:08.022
I know about Sam.

01:02:08.056 --> 01:02:12.127
He and David, they're... they're
trying to call this thing off.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.161
Change of plans, John.

01:02:13.194 --> 01:02:14.629
You need to lose David.

01:02:14.663 --> 01:02:16.598
There's no telling what he
might do when he gets here

01:02:16.631 --> 01:02:19.301
and find out about your
wife, about everything.

01:02:19.334 --> 01:02:22.971
You need to come alone.

01:02:23.004 --> 01:02:24.707
What are you telling me?

01:02:24.739 --> 01:02:25.506
He's my son, John.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.642
Don't kill him.

01:02:26.674 --> 01:02:28.544
Just find a way
to get rid of him.

01:02:28.576 --> 01:02:30.279
Leave him there on
the side of the road.

01:02:30.312 --> 01:02:31.447
He can manage.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.349
I know you told
me to come alone.

01:02:33.381 --> 01:02:35.017
But what about Sam?

01:02:35.049 --> 01:02:37.618
Let me know after you've
gotten rid of David.

01:02:37.652 --> 01:02:38.620
Are you listening to me?

01:02:38.652 --> 01:02:39.654
What about Sam?

01:02:39.687 --> 01:02:41.622
Come to the cabin alone, John.

01:02:41.656 --> 01:02:43.192
That is all.

01:02:43.225 --> 01:02:46.194
If anyone is here when
you show up... well,

01:02:46.227 --> 01:02:48.062
you know what'll happen.

01:02:48.096 --> 01:02:49.398
Wait.

01:02:49.431 --> 01:02:50.399
There's something you
need to know about Anne.

01:03:14.823 --> 01:03:17.426
Who the hell are you?

01:03:17.459 --> 01:03:22.564
Listen, no more talking.

01:03:22.596 --> 01:03:24.132
Where's Sam?

01:03:24.165 --> 01:03:26.434
I said be quiet.

01:03:26.468 --> 01:03:27.770
Were you waiting for us?

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.404
Is this part of the plan?

01:03:29.437 --> 01:03:30.571
Where is Sam?

01:03:30.605 --> 01:03:35.811
Sam Rigsby, your
friend... he's dead.

01:03:35.843 --> 01:03:36.711
Sorry.

01:03:40.281 --> 01:03:41.149
Let's go.

01:03:49.524 --> 01:03:51.460
God.

01:03:51.493 --> 01:03:52.294
No.

01:03:52.326 --> 01:03:53.828
He said be quiet.

01:03:53.861 --> 01:03:55.096
Sam.

01:03:55.129 --> 01:03:57.231
Sam's never been
here, all right?

01:03:57.265 --> 01:03:58.232
It's just been us.

01:03:58.265 --> 01:03:59.500
You know this.

01:03:59.533 --> 01:04:00.802
Bobby, enough's enough.

01:04:00.835 --> 01:04:02.437
We're going back home.

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:04.706
I'll find someplace to turn
this damn thing around.

01:04:04.739 --> 01:04:05.707
Just take it easy.

01:04:05.739 --> 01:04:07.375
We don't have time for this.

01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:08.643
He'll kill her if I don't
show up with the money.

01:04:08.676 --> 01:04:09.377
Jesus!

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.811
Don't move!

01:04:09.844 --> 01:04:10.645
Shit!

01:04:10.678 --> 01:04:11.379
I said don't move!

01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:12.648
Stop the RV.

01:04:12.681 --> 01:04:14.349
Jesus, David, you
brought the fucking gun?

01:04:14.381 --> 01:04:15.249
I must have forgot about it.

01:04:15.283 --> 01:04:16.285
Shut up, both of you!

01:04:16.317 --> 01:04:17.218
Stupid asshole.

01:04:17.252 --> 01:04:18.187
I said shut up.

01:04:19.386 --> 01:04:20.488
God damn it, Bobby,
do something.

01:04:20.522 --> 01:04:22.257
Stop the RV now!

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:24.225
Stop!

01:04:27.228 --> 01:04:28.596
Stop!

01:04:28.629 --> 01:04:30.565
Stop it, Bobby!

01:04:30.598 --> 01:04:31.332
Fuck!

01:04:39.573 --> 01:04:41.109
No!

01:06:08.696 --> 01:06:10.431
I'll call the police
after I get Anne.

01:06:12.267 --> 01:06:14.236
You two should be
OK for a while.

01:06:46.033 --> 01:06:47.568
Hang on, Annie.

01:06:47.602 --> 01:06:49.571
I'm coming, baby.

01:06:49.603 --> 01:06:51.973
John!

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.917
Please let me go!

01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:03.819
No!

01:07:12.527 --> 01:07:13.495
No.

01:07:13.527 --> 01:07:15.497
No!

01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.930
No!

01:07:15.964 --> 01:07:17.498
Come on!

01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:19.867
Go!

01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:21.402
Piece of shit.

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:09.984
Come in, god damn it.

01:08:10.018 --> 01:08:11.786
Are you close?

01:08:11.819 --> 01:08:13.689
About half a mile away.

01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:15.723
The RV died, and I'm hurt.

01:08:15.756 --> 01:08:17.392
But I'll be there.

01:08:17.425 --> 01:08:20.328
Leave the money outside
the cabin, then come in.

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:21.729
Better get a move on, John.

01:08:21.763 --> 01:08:24.631
Remember, come alone.

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:25.533
I'll be there.

01:08:25.567 --> 01:08:26.602
Just don't hurt her, OK?

01:08:29.504 --> 01:08:30.671
Did you hear me?

01:08:30.705 --> 01:08:32.506
Better get a move on, John.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.876
Remember, come alone.

01:08:34.908 --> 01:08:37.946
Look, I crashed into a
goddamn tree, but I'm coming.

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:39.848
Better get a move on, John.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:44.018
Remember, come alone.

01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:45.886
Better get a move on, John.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.689
R-r-remember, come alone.

01:08:49.724 --> 01:08:51.693
Better get a move on, John.

01:08:51.725 --> 01:08:53.696
Remember, come alone.

01:09:04.037 --> 01:09:06.607
Hello, John.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.644
I thought I told you not
to involve the authorities.

01:09:10.678 --> 01:09:14.881
You're forgetting
I'm in control here.

01:09:14.916 --> 01:09:16.518
Do you think I want
to do this, John?

01:09:17.919 --> 01:09:18.854
I'm not a monster.

01:09:18.886 --> 01:09:19.787
What the hell?

01:09:19.821 --> 01:09:22.122
But I am a desperate man.

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:24.059
Don't-don't push me.

01:09:24.091 --> 01:09:25.594
Remember Anne.

01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:51.986
Just give me my money and
you'll see your wife again.

01:09:52.019 --> 01:09:55.823
Don't let David
see you on the CB.

01:09:55.857 --> 01:09:59.161
There's no telling
what he'll do.

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:08.803
I haven't been
talking to anyone.

01:10:08.836 --> 01:10:10.205
Did you hear me?

01:10:10.237 --> 01:10:12.173
Are you listening to me?

01:10:12.206 --> 01:10:16.577
I haven't been
talking to anyone!

01:10:16.611 --> 01:10:18.078
What the hell do you want?

01:10:19.147 --> 01:10:20.982
What have you done with my wife?

01:10:21.014 --> 01:10:21.950
Remember Anne.

01:10:21.983 --> 01:10:23.518
Remember Anne.

01:10:35.162 --> 01:10:36.764
All right, asshole.

01:10:36.797 --> 01:10:37.666
You want to play games?

01:10:57.285 --> 01:11:00.221
Hold on, baby.

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:02.190
No!

01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:03.091
No!

01:11:24.645 --> 01:11:26.614
Shit!

01:11:26.648 --> 01:11:29.518
OK, old friend.

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:30.684
Let's do this.

01:11:30.718 --> 01:11:31.586
John!

01:11:58.845 --> 01:11:59.747
Stay away.

01:12:07.822 --> 01:12:10.125
You.

01:12:10.157 --> 01:12:10.825
What do you want?

01:12:13.294 --> 01:12:14.997
Somehow you're behind
all this, aren't you?

01:12:18.666 --> 01:12:21.570
Me?

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:22.237
I don't understand.

01:12:22.269 --> 01:12:23.004
What are you saying?

01:12:28.242 --> 01:12:29.111
You want me to go back?

01:12:32.145 --> 01:12:33.614
I can't do that.

01:12:33.648 --> 01:12:34.116
Anne is in there.

01:12:38.086 --> 01:12:41.790
You need to get out of
my way, you hear me?

01:12:41.822 --> 01:12:44.325
Get out of my way!

01:12:44.358 --> 01:12:45.292
Move.

01:12:45.326 --> 01:12:47.895
Move!

01:12:47.929 --> 01:12:49.230
I'll shoot you, I swear!

01:12:53.067 --> 01:12:53.935
Leave!

01:13:21.129 --> 01:13:22.331
Jesus Christ.

01:13:41.314 --> 01:13:42.783
All right, you son of a bitch.

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:59.200
Anne?

01:13:59.233 --> 01:14:00.102
Annie!

01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:03.338
Hello?

01:14:17.952 --> 01:14:18.820
Annie!

01:14:21.054 --> 01:14:21.989
You need to go faster.

01:14:22.023 --> 01:14:23.024
I've got my foot on the...

01:14:23.056 --> 01:14:23.992
Faster!

01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:24.893
Jesus.

01:14:33.968 --> 01:14:34.870
Where are you?

01:15:11.538 --> 01:15:14.742
Hello, John.

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:18.779
If the plan has worked,
then you are here alone.

01:15:18.813 --> 01:15:23.384
The money is outside, and
you are completely confused.

01:15:23.416 --> 01:15:25.219
You're locked in.

01:15:25.252 --> 01:15:26.822
Don't bother trying to escape.

01:15:31.259 --> 01:15:35.029
Anne is dead, John.

01:15:35.062 --> 01:15:35.930
I'm sorry.

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:55.450
But I did not kill her.

01:15:55.483 --> 01:15:58.019
She's been dead for
over seven years.

01:15:58.051 --> 01:16:01.255
It was cancer that
took her, not me.

01:16:03.957 --> 01:16:06.928
She died on March
the 12th of 2005.

01:16:06.961 --> 01:16:10.165
She was 62 years old.

01:16:10.197 --> 01:16:11.899
What?

01:16:11.933 --> 01:16:15.537
And like her, John,
you too have a disease.

01:16:15.569 --> 01:16:20.841
But a disease that affects
the mind, not the body.

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:22.443
Wait.

01:16:22.475 --> 01:16:23.411
Wait.

01:16:23.443 --> 01:16:25.212
You are over 67 years old.

01:16:25.246 --> 01:16:28.216
You have two grown
sons, David and Bobby.

01:16:28.248 --> 01:16:29.349
What would we name him?

01:16:29.382 --> 01:16:32.220
We could name him
after your dad.

01:16:32.252 --> 01:16:33.822
David?

01:16:33.854 --> 01:16:35.156
Yeah.

01:16:35.188 --> 01:16:35.856
David.

01:16:38.526 --> 01:16:41.162
You were married
to Anne in 1974.

01:16:41.194 --> 01:16:43.331
Sam Rigsby was your best man.

01:16:43.363 --> 01:16:45.032
You're getting married?

01:16:45.065 --> 01:16:47.035
1973?

01:16:47.068 --> 01:16:50.371
That just happened.

01:16:50.403 --> 01:16:54.274
You were diagnosed with
Alzheimer's a while ago.

01:16:54.308 --> 01:16:56.877
My father is a sick man.

01:16:56.911 --> 01:16:58.580
I know this is a difficult time.

01:16:58.612 --> 01:17:02.015
Your name is John
Whitmore, the same as mine.

01:17:02.049 --> 01:17:03.384
No.

01:17:03.416 --> 01:17:04.251
No.

01:17:04.285 --> 01:17:05.252
No, no, no.

01:17:05.286 --> 01:17:07.288
I'm John Whitmore, not you!

01:17:07.321 --> 01:17:08.957
I'm John Whitmore.

01:17:08.989 --> 01:17:10.390
I'm leaving this
message for myself

01:17:10.424 --> 01:17:12.426
because I don't
have a lot of time.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.629
Several months ago,
I began waking up

01:17:14.662 --> 01:17:19.434
not knowing who I was, imagining
myself as a younger me...

01:17:19.466 --> 01:17:20.567
You can't do this, John.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.902
You're gonna get her killed.

01:17:21.935 --> 01:17:22.937
You realize that, right?

01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:24.405
Forgetting gaps of time.

01:17:24.438 --> 01:17:26.107
What happened to the last hour?

01:17:26.139 --> 01:17:28.142
The doctor said I was
on a downward slope,

01:17:28.175 --> 01:17:31.379
that the disease would
progress quickly.

01:17:31.412 --> 01:17:34.015
I began getting people
mixed up, confusing them

01:17:34.047 --> 01:17:34.983
with old friends.

01:17:35.015 --> 01:17:36.216
God damn it, what was it?

01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:38.051
Hold on, just a second.

01:17:38.085 --> 01:17:39.053
Sam.

01:17:39.086 --> 01:17:39.921
Sam.

01:17:39.953 --> 01:17:41.255
My name is not Sam.

01:17:41.288 --> 01:17:41.956
What?

01:17:41.988 --> 01:17:43.357
No.

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:45.259
It's been tough on
David and Bobby...

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:47.261
I didn't want any of this!

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.130
Watching their
father's mind go.

01:17:49.162 --> 01:17:49.964
Shut up!

01:17:50.531 --> 01:17:52.132
I said shut up!

01:17:52.166 --> 01:17:54.369
They've had to tell me
about Anne dying more times

01:17:54.402 --> 01:17:55.303
than I can bear.

01:17:58.072 --> 01:18:00.174
Each time, it got
harder for them.

01:18:00.206 --> 01:18:03.111
So I made them promise
not to tell me the truth.

01:18:03.144 --> 01:18:04.145
Just tell me the truth!

01:18:04.178 --> 01:18:06.413
I can't!

01:18:06.447 --> 01:18:08.583
To let me live in
peace, thinking she

01:18:08.616 --> 01:18:10.585
might come through the
door at any moment.

01:18:10.617 --> 01:18:11.486
Annie.

01:18:14.587 --> 01:18:16.056
I'm sorry.

01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:17.592
If you're here
looking for Anne, this

01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:22.330
must be coming as a
shock to you... to me.

01:18:22.362 --> 01:18:26.166
For what it's worth, the love
that you and Anne shared...

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.169
No disease can take that away.

01:18:48.221 --> 01:18:49.123
I remember.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.028
I remember.

01:18:55.062 --> 01:18:58.032
I re... I remember now.

01:19:06.072 --> 01:19:06.974
I remember.

01:19:17.417 --> 01:19:18.987
It's up here on the right.

01:19:19.019 --> 01:19:19.620
There!

01:19:19.653 --> 01:19:21.990
Stop, stop, stop!

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:22.690
Go call the cops!

01:19:27.394 --> 01:19:30.330
But why?

01:19:30.363 --> 01:19:32.466
Why... why all this?

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.135
Why?

01:19:34.167 --> 01:19:36.136
Why lead me here?

01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:37.605
Why would I do this?

01:19:37.638 --> 01:19:42.510
This brings me to the
hardest part, old friend.

01:19:42.542 --> 01:19:44.478
I wanted to live out
the rest of my days

01:19:44.511 --> 01:19:47.114
as long as my mind was intact.

01:19:47.148 --> 01:19:48.616
After that, I couldn't
bear the thought

01:19:48.648 --> 01:19:51.051
of living my life in the dark.

01:19:51.085 --> 01:19:54.355
I wanted to leave
on my terms, my way.

01:19:54.388 --> 01:19:55.689
Do you understand?

01:19:55.723 --> 01:19:57.325
Yeah.

01:19:57.358 --> 01:19:59.494
Added to this, the financial
toll of Alzheimer's, it

01:19:59.527 --> 01:20:02.397
was just too much.

01:20:02.429 --> 01:20:08.101
So I decided when my mind
went, the rest of me would too.

01:20:08.135 --> 01:20:09.103
Wait.

01:20:09.135 --> 01:20:10.737
But therein lay the problem.

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:13.707
How would I know it was time to
end my life if I couldn't even

01:20:13.741 --> 01:20:15.510
remember who I was?

01:20:15.542 --> 01:20:20.147
So I set a trap for
myself, for you, for us.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.782
Hello, John.

01:20:21.815 --> 01:20:23.584
I have your wife.

01:20:23.617 --> 01:20:26.287
If you want to see her
again, do exactly as I say.

01:20:26.319 --> 01:20:28.656
When I no longer
recognized my own voice...

01:20:28.688 --> 01:20:30.290
Somehow I know this man.

01:20:30.323 --> 01:20:33.527
My own trap... it
would be triggered.

01:20:37.331 --> 01:20:39.834
I knew that if I could convince
myself that Anne was here,

01:20:39.867 --> 01:20:41.803
that she was in danger,
it might be the one

01:20:41.836 --> 01:20:43.471
thing that I could hold onto.

01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:44.839
No.

01:20:44.871 --> 01:20:46.473
David thinks that he
brought me here to pack up

01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:47.575
the cabin to sell it.

01:20:47.608 --> 01:20:48.743
What's this?

01:20:48.776 --> 01:20:51.078
David, we've got
to sell that cabin.

01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:53.848
The money that you
brought is for them.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.450
Their inheritance.

01:20:56.483 --> 01:20:57.852
Dad!

01:20:57.885 --> 01:20:58.753
Dad!

01:21:03.657 --> 01:21:04.257
Dad, let us in!

01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:04.826
Boys.

01:21:04.858 --> 01:21:05.559
Open the door!

01:21:05.593 --> 01:21:06.193
I'm in here.

01:21:06.227 --> 01:21:07.428
Dad!

01:21:07.461 --> 01:21:08.429
Dad, open the door!

01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:10.330
What the fuck?

01:21:10.363 --> 01:21:11.232
Go around back!

01:21:11.264 --> 01:21:12.834
Check another window!

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:15.837
Dad, open the door!

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:18.238
I can't.

01:21:18.272 --> 01:21:20.341
Dad, let us in.

01:21:20.373 --> 01:21:21.475
The door's sealed.

01:21:23.676 --> 01:21:24.845
David.

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.647
David, are you all right?

01:21:26.679 --> 01:21:28.115
Your shoulder.

01:21:28.148 --> 01:21:29.549
Are you both all right?

01:21:29.582 --> 01:21:30.785
We're fine.

01:21:30.818 --> 01:21:33.154
I was confused.

01:21:33.187 --> 01:21:33.854
I didn't know.

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:34.788
Dad, listen.

01:21:34.822 --> 01:21:36.390
Just stay calm.

01:21:36.422 --> 01:21:39.260
We have to get you out of there.

01:21:39.292 --> 01:21:42.330
There's... there's
gas filling the room.

01:21:42.362 --> 01:21:44.231
Fuck.

01:21:44.264 --> 01:21:45.198
Dad, look around!

01:21:45.232 --> 01:21:45.867
Is there another way out?

01:21:45.899 --> 01:21:46.834
Look for a window.

01:21:48.801 --> 01:21:52.272
I'm sorry I had to
put you through this.

01:21:52.305 --> 01:21:55.776
I've thought about
this long and hard.

01:21:55.809 --> 01:21:58.312
And it's what I want.

01:21:58.345 --> 01:22:00.815
It's what we want.

01:22:00.848 --> 01:22:03.184
To end things on our terms.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:10.825
I told you that if you made
it here you'd see Anne again.

01:22:10.858 --> 01:22:14.695
God willing, we will.

01:22:14.728 --> 01:22:17.297
Anne was right.

01:22:17.331 --> 01:22:21.469
We can only control so much.

01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:24.272
The rest is chaos.

01:22:24.304 --> 01:22:25.305
But it's beautiful.

01:22:31.312 --> 01:22:34.215
Dad?

01:22:34.247 --> 01:22:36.216
Dad?

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:39.886
Boys, I'm... I'm
sorry for all this.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.889
I was confused.

01:22:41.921 --> 01:22:44.192
But I'm OK now.

01:22:44.224 --> 01:22:45.492
I understand.

01:22:45.526 --> 01:22:49.330
What are you talking about?

01:22:49.362 --> 01:22:51.231
I want you to know that I...

01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:56.871
I love you very much.

01:23:00.006 --> 01:23:02.643
Your mother does too.

01:23:07.648 --> 01:23:11.219
I love you too, Dad.

01:23:11.251 --> 01:23:14.487
Now get away from the cabin.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.957
Do you understand?

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.792
We can get you out.

01:23:18.826 --> 01:23:20.261
No.

01:23:20.294 --> 01:23:23.464
This is how I want
it... my way, remember?

01:23:23.496 --> 01:23:24.898
Take that satchel.

01:23:24.931 --> 01:23:28.469
That's for both of you.

01:23:28.501 --> 01:23:30.604
David, take your brother
and get away from the cabin!

01:23:35.376 --> 01:23:36.010
No!

01:23:36.042 --> 01:23:37.577
Wait.
Bobby.

01:23:37.611 --> 01:23:38.813
We gotta leave him.

01:23:38.845 --> 01:23:40.281
Go.
Now!

01:23:40.313 --> 01:23:40.847
We can't leave him.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.715
Bobby!

01:23:41.748 --> 01:23:42.683
Go!

01:23:42.715 --> 01:23:44.651
God damn it, we gotta go!

01:23:45.885 --> 01:23:48.888
It's getting late, old friend.

01:23:48.921 --> 01:23:50.491
It's time for me to sign off.

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:57.331
To our life.

01:23:57.363 --> 01:23:58.265
To my life.

01:24:34.367 --> 01:24:35.269
Hey, you.
