00:00.209 --> 00:02.201
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.287 --> 00:03.636
Adam wanted me to give you this.

00:03.716 --> 00:05.520
- What's the symbol?
- Never seen it before.

00:05.643 --> 00:07.836
- What is it?
- The company was sold this morning.

00:07.916 --> 00:09.169
What does this mean?

00:09.249 --> 00:10.458
I just lost my job.

00:11.127 --> 00:13.722
XY's brain is powerful,
much like a computer.

00:13.808 --> 00:16.546
We need what Kyle knows.
That's where she comes in.

00:16.626 --> 00:18.111
What, like a mental hacker?

00:18.236 --> 00:19.759
In a manner of speaking, yes.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.580
She thinks that she's my sister.

00:21.666 --> 00:23.556
I'm just supposed to live that lie?

00:23.636 --> 00:25.376
Destabilizing the boy's
support structure

00:25.456 --> 00:27.986
will make him more vulnerable,
receptive to her.

00:28.072 --> 00:29.572
Get her into that family's life.

00:29.658 --> 00:32.174
My sister Jessi,
she's been having some problems,

00:32.255 --> 00:34.515
and I was hoping you might
be able to sit down with her.

00:34.613 --> 00:36.076
I think I might be able to help you.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.761
Jessi's got herself a therapist.

00:37.859 --> 00:38.916
What is this?

00:39.002 --> 00:40.167
It's your new car.

00:40.247 --> 00:41.616
I thought we could work on it.

00:41.702 --> 00:43.928
Why don't you come over later?
I'll be home around 4.

00:44.026 --> 00:47.370
If you don't show up,
then I know there's nothing left to say.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.601
Where the hell is he going?

01:03.396 --> 01:04.501
About Charlie...

01:04.587 --> 01:06.442
I should have told you
what was going on.

01:06.522 --> 01:10.404
Yeah, well, being someone's friend
isn't about what you should have done...

01:10.834 --> 01:12.179
it's about what you do.

01:19.765 --> 01:21.954
Foss calls it sensory deprivation.

01:22.925 --> 01:24.450
The removal of all other senses

01:24.536 --> 01:27.062
to enhance the one sense that remains.

01:28.186 --> 01:31.286
As I focused on the nighttime
sounds that surrounded me,

01:31.483 --> 01:34.515
the world became more vid
than it ever had before.

01:34.629 --> 01:36.348
So did the people around me.

01:37.383 --> 01:39.088
I could sense things,

01:39.168 --> 01:41.761
like the guilt and uncertainty
over losing a job.

01:45.548 --> 01:48.812
Or the anxiety and self-doubt
over starting a new one.

01:51.867 --> 01:55.421
Even staying up way past bedtime
to spend time with a new friend.

01:57.167 --> 01:59.506
Or the first sparks of creativity...

01:59.638 --> 02:02.539
which can't quite mask the pain
over a break-up.

02:03.695 --> 02:06.941
But soon the walls of the Trager house
began to disappear...

02:09.776 --> 02:12.790
and I could hear past
the symphony of crickets...

02:13.896 --> 02:15.900
all the way into Amanda's house

02:16.207 --> 02:18.961
where I could hear the soft
pounding of her heart.

02:21.593 --> 02:24.722
It seemed even a broken heart
still beats the same.

02:27.389 --> 02:29.159
But there was another heartbeat.

02:29.257 --> 02:30.510
It was different,

02:30.805 --> 02:31.875
erratic.

02:42.567 --> 02:44.239
- Are you all right?
- There was a man.

02:44.337 --> 02:45.678
He's getting away.

03:02.658 --> 03:04.203
The thing about sensory deprivation

03:04.283 --> 03:06.764
is you can use it to enhance
any of the senses.

03:07.019 --> 03:08.179
But like my hearing,

03:08.265 --> 03:10.564
in order to increase
what my eyes could see,

03:10.687 --> 03:12.900
I had to tune out all of
my other senses...

03:15.680 --> 03:17.992
until the only thing left was my vision.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.518
Otherwise I would have
heard the car start.

03:43.246 --> 03:45.518
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 5:
Come To Your Senses</font>

03:55.056 --> 03:56.174
Are you okay?

03:56.838 --> 03:57.884
Yeah...

03:58.971 --> 03:59.998
sort of.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.278
I guess he got away?

04:02.377 --> 04:05.413
- I tried to follow him, but...
- Detective Myatt, this is my...

04:05.672 --> 04:07.393
daughter Amanda.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.089
And you would be?

04:12.934 --> 04:15.442
- I live next door, and I...
- Have nothing to do with this.

04:15.535 --> 04:17.464
Mom, of course he has
something to do with this.

04:17.551 --> 04:18.836
He chased after the guy.

04:18.922 --> 04:20.620
Did you get a good look at him?

04:21.567 --> 04:22.759
He drove away too fast.

04:22.993 --> 04:25.120
Did you catch the license plate number?

04:27.136 --> 04:28.125
I'm sorry.

04:29.128 --> 04:30.535
Is there anything else missing?

04:32.816 --> 04:34.206
Just my bracelet.

04:35.338 --> 04:37.219
It was a gold antique charm bracelet.

04:37.994 --> 04:40.121
It's been in my family forever.

04:44.108 --> 04:45.863
It was a gift from my dad.

04:46.312 --> 04:47.895
Do you mind if I take it to make a copy?

04:47.981 --> 04:49.444
No, that's fine.

04:52.739 --> 04:56.091
I'm sure the police will do everything
they can to find it, sweetheart.

04:56.202 --> 04:57.861
The important thing is no one was hurt.

04:58.456 --> 05:00.480
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

05:01.415 --> 05:04.358
You can let us deal with this
as a family.

05:38.723 --> 05:41.158
You haven't heard from Declan
lately, have you?

05:41.256 --> 05:42.805
No. Why?

05:42.999 --> 05:45.756
Want him to pick up the crap
he left here, and he won't call me back.

05:45.836 --> 05:48.061
It's like he's totally
gone off the grid.

05:50.335 --> 05:53.151
I take it things aren't back to normal
with you and Amanda.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.487
Why would you say that?

05:55.585 --> 05:57.127
You've got your "Amanda" look.

05:57.995 --> 05:59.458
I have an "Amanda" look?

06:00.417 --> 06:01.807
Three or four.

06:02.426 --> 06:03.759
Which one do I have now?

06:03.839 --> 06:06.791
The one every girl wants a guy
to have when he's thinking about her.

06:08.353 --> 06:09.619
Just give her time.

06:09.742 --> 06:11.896
I just think we should
call the alarm company.

06:11.976 --> 06:13.946
So they send someone out
to check out our system.

06:14.026 --> 06:16.055
Only thing that'd bother me
more than an intruder

06:16.141 --> 06:18.420
would be that creep
Tom Foss showing up again.

06:18.624 --> 06:21.993
Why do we have an alarm anyway if
we have Kyle to chase down the bad guys?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.478
I wanted to talk to you about that.

06:23.558 --> 06:25.663
Chasing after that guy?
What were you thinking?

06:25.903 --> 06:27.624
I was thinking I wanted to catch him.

06:28.189 --> 06:29.542
Well, I'm off to work.

06:29.653 --> 06:31.824
Figure somebody in this house
should have a job.

06:31.919 --> 06:34.980
You know, Josh, I happen
to be seeing my first patient today.

06:35.423 --> 06:36.448
Great.

06:36.528 --> 06:38.459
You're worried about
some whack job breaking in,

06:38.545 --> 06:40.710
but inviting them in is no big deal?

06:41.620 --> 06:43.354
I'm just saying...
Is it really a good idea

06:43.440 --> 06:45.677
to bring your freaky patients
into your house?

06:48.777 --> 06:49.773
No offense, Kyle.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.204
That reminds me, guys.

06:52.284 --> 06:53.904
My patients expect privacy.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.481
So my office is off limits.

06:55.561 --> 06:56.803
So please...

06:56.883 --> 06:59.179
make yourself scarce
whenever I have a session.

06:59.536 --> 07:01.933
And my patient is not a freak.

07:14.757 --> 07:16.981
You know that you can
turn the lights on.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.555
What for?

07:21.064 --> 07:22.207
Forget it.

07:23.425 --> 07:26.105
Are you ready for your
first session with Dr. Trager?

07:29.363 --> 07:31.308
Why do I have to do this?

07:32.917 --> 07:36.077
Because you've had a hard time
since we moved here.

07:36.605 --> 07:39.176
It's been hard for you
adjusting and making friends.

07:47.461 --> 07:49.404
I think you're ready.

07:58.121 --> 08:00.594
I know what you're thinking.
I've sent out a million r\sum\s,

08:00.674 --> 08:02.430
I've talked to that headhunter.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.158
And besides, this is fun.

08:04.939 --> 08:07.104
Fine. Fine. Could you just
keep it down a little?

08:07.190 --> 08:08.500
My patient will be here soon.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.598
Yeah, no problem.

08:10.397 --> 08:13.545
Besides, I wanna check out
Josh's new headset anyway.

08:15.548 --> 08:16.901
Hair-trigger Trager!

08:17.012 --> 08:18.450
Thought you were at work.

08:19.279 --> 08:20.643
Hello? Is somebody talking to me?

08:20.754 --> 08:21.794
Well, duh!

08:21.885 --> 08:24.897
Sounds like Josh has been
smokin' more of that skunk weed.

08:25.566 --> 08:28.885
You're hearing' voices, man!
You know that stuff makes you paranoid.

08:30.607 --> 08:33.816
Put your hands up and step away
from the bowl, Trager!

08:36.336 --> 08:37.578
Skunk weed?

08:50.144 --> 08:51.951
Hi, Emily. Please come in.

08:52.418 --> 08:53.673
Hello.

08:53.955 --> 08:55.223
And you must be Jessi.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.759
I'm Nicole.

09:14.490 --> 09:15.535
It's okay.

09:15.633 --> 09:17.944
You're in good hands with Dr. Trager.

09:19.432 --> 09:21.559
I'll be back in an hour, okay?

09:28.740 --> 09:30.436
So, are you ready to get started?

09:31.334 --> 09:32.342
Yes.

09:32.422 --> 09:33.996
My office is right this way.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.843
Just this way.

10:19.182 --> 10:21.822
Moving to a new town can be
difficult for anyone,

10:21.902 --> 10:25.169
but you could try to look at
this as a new beginning.

10:25.674 --> 10:27.786
A chance to leave behind
whatever you didn't like

10:27.866 --> 10:29.338
about your old life.

10:30.482 --> 10:32.007
You're a blank slate.

10:42.531 --> 10:44.087
Jessi, are you all right?

10:45.322 --> 10:46.871
There's someone there.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.672
Jessi, we're alone.

11:02.545 --> 11:04.131
There's someone out there.

11:32.397 --> 11:33.663
There you are.

11:34.155 --> 11:36.651
The police called.
They told me they have a suspect.

11:36.786 --> 11:39.208
Yeah. They want to see if
I can identify him.

11:40.105 --> 11:41.581
Did they find your bracelet?

11:41.691 --> 11:42.724
Not yet.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.060
Why are you down here?

11:45.450 --> 11:47.033
Detective Myatt wanted me to come down

11:47.113 --> 11:49.790
and try and identify the car
they think the intruder used.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.065
Why would people risk stealing

11:57.145 --> 11:59.396
if they could end up here
and lose everything?

12:01.360 --> 12:03.428
I guess they count on
not getting caught.

12:04.471 --> 12:06.440
But odds are they will, eventually.

12:08.404 --> 12:11.656
How much time will the guy that
broke into your house spend in prison?

12:12.203 --> 12:13.629
Kyle, I don't care.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.409
I just want my bracelet back.

12:20.151 --> 12:23.459
You know, it never really mattered to me
how much it was worth.

12:24.442 --> 12:26.840
It was the last thing my dad
gave me before he died.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.069
That's what made it special.

12:35.876 --> 12:37.548
I guess that sounds silly.

12:37.892 --> 12:38.937
No.

12:39.896 --> 12:41.532
I understand.

12:43.768 --> 12:45.158
I feel the same way about this.

12:49.916 --> 12:51.502
Did you get that from your family?

12:55.548 --> 12:56.593
Yes.

13:02.757 --> 13:05.235
I wish there's more I could do.
With what you've been through,

13:05.321 --> 13:07.043
You've been through a lot, too.

13:07.129 --> 13:09.273
Kyle, stop worrying about me.

13:09.772 --> 13:10.817
I'm fine.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.052
No, you're not.

13:15.798 --> 13:17.961
I just want things to go back
to the way they were.

13:36.908 --> 13:38.788
Your... your dad let me in.

13:39.712 --> 13:40.740
How you been?

13:41.556 --> 13:42.601
Okay.

13:43.327 --> 13:44.597
Where you been?

13:45.294 --> 13:46.339
Around.

13:47.642 --> 13:50.126
Okay. Well, if you're gonna be
all vague and monosyllabic,

13:50.224 --> 13:52.400
I mean, let's just get
the hostage trade over with.

13:55.923 --> 13:58.013
So, is that everything?

14:02.132 --> 14:03.349
Now it is.

14:04.235 --> 14:05.944
I gave that to you for Christmas.

14:06.165 --> 14:07.440
And now I'm giving it back.

14:09.485 --> 14:10.739
You keep it.

14:17.009 --> 14:19.842
Then we're done. I'll have
my lawyer send over the paperwork.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.224
You know, if you ever need anything...

14:24.834 --> 14:26.310
if anything ever happens...

14:29.062 --> 14:31.128
- I'm here for you, right?
- Are you confused about

14:31.214 --> 14:34.013
the whole dumping thing?
It kinda means I stop counting on you.

14:34.283 --> 14:35.460
- Trager...
- It also means

14:35.540 --> 14:37.271
you're no longer allowed to "Trager" me.

14:59.029 --> 15:00.029
I'll walk you out, Jessi.

15:00.109 --> 15:01.996
Let me call your sister,
tell her you're ready.

15:02.076 --> 15:03.162
Okay.

15:26.716 --> 15:27.945
Little help?

15:33.625 --> 15:34.646
Great.

15:47.494 --> 15:48.793
For whose pleasure?

15:51.085 --> 15:52.278
What?

15:53.704 --> 15:55.609
It says "Ribbed for her"... Nobody.

16:03.237 --> 16:04.416
Thanks.

16:12.384 --> 16:13.442
You...

16:13.835 --> 16:15.606
think you could get the door for me?

16:22.576 --> 16:24.730
I'm Declan, by the way.

16:31.036 --> 16:33.421
"Nice to meet you, Declan.
My name's... "

16:38.819 --> 16:41.585
Usually, that'd be where
you'd say your name.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.253
Jessi.

16:47.843 --> 16:49.098
Later, Jessi.

17:10.393 --> 17:12.359
Does this look like the car you saw?

17:16.922 --> 17:18.202
I guess so.

17:19.098 --> 17:21.766
Unfortunately, this car
was stolen last week.

17:22.724 --> 17:24.471
We found it abandoned.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.967
This is incredibly detailed.

17:30.053 --> 17:31.861
Are you sure you didn't
see the guy's face?

17:32.008 --> 17:34.455
Kyle, maybe you can remember
if you concentrate.

17:36.029 --> 17:37.074
I'm sorry.

17:37.811 --> 17:39.311
I didn't see him. I wish I did.

17:41.524 --> 17:43.037
Well, hopefully, you can ID him.

18:01.258 --> 18:02.328
How'd it go?

18:02.487 --> 18:04.201
I'm still getting my feet wet.

18:04.774 --> 18:05.819
Good.

18:06.089 --> 18:08.586
'Cause I'm in a little over my head.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.220
Josh is smoking pot.

18:13.540 --> 18:14.634
What?

18:15.089 --> 18:16.245
How do you know?

18:16.417 --> 18:18.089
I overheard his friends talking.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.737
It's a long story.

18:21.446 --> 18:22.670
How could we miss it?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.265
I don't know. But I searched his room.

18:24.345 --> 18:25.589
I couldn't find anything.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.602
Maybe his friends were kidding.
I mean, where would Josh get pot?

18:35.105 --> 18:36.224
What is it?

18:36.912 --> 18:38.437
I think we're Josh's supplier.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.486
- What are you talking about?
- He found our pot stash.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.946
We have a pot stash?

18:45.237 --> 18:46.943
- Not anymore.
- Where did that come from?

18:47.023 --> 18:49.392
- That New Year's party.
- That was years ago.

18:49.897 --> 18:51.495
You were supposed to get rid of that.

18:51.594 --> 18:53.475
Oh, so it's my fault
I didn't smoke it all?

18:59.011 --> 19:00.412
What are we gonna tell Josh?

19:00.535 --> 19:01.834
That you have cancer.

19:03.215 --> 19:04.297
I don't know.

19:05.023 --> 19:06.166
We have to make sure he knows

19:06.252 --> 19:08.293
that we're not gonna
stand for him doing drugs.

19:08.392 --> 19:09.707
All right. So...

19:10.371 --> 19:11.820
Good Cop/Bad Cop?

19:11.920 --> 19:13.578
More like Bad Cop/Worse Cop.

19:13.689 --> 19:14.734
All right...

19:15.041 --> 19:16.320
Which one am I?

19:16.443 --> 19:17.900
Bad Cop. You go in first.

19:17.986 --> 19:19.861
I'll go after, make sure
he's scared straight.

19:19.947 --> 19:21.656
Why do I have to go first?

19:23.624 --> 19:24.669
All right.

19:24.767 --> 19:25.956
I'll go first.

19:31.714 --> 19:32.832
What happened?

19:33.177 --> 19:34.892
I couldn't say which one it was.

19:43.032 --> 19:44.876
As all the sound dropped away,

19:44.962 --> 19:47.003
I could hear the beating of many hearts,

19:47.089 --> 19:48.601
some faster than others.

19:49.081 --> 19:51.355
But all pounded with the same tempo...

19:51.650 --> 19:53.088
all except one.

19:53.925 --> 19:56.307
This man's heartbeat had
a distinct arrhythmic pattern

19:56.387 --> 19:58.301
just like the intruder
at Amanda's house.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.957
They're never gonna find
who took my bracelet.

20:01.264 --> 20:02.454
Amanda was wrong.

20:02.534 --> 20:03.637
It was him.

20:03.846 --> 20:05.150
I was sure of it.

20:07.363 --> 20:08.593
You two can head home.

20:08.851 --> 20:09.970
I'll keep you posted.

20:13.631 --> 20:16.274
I'd already told the police
I hadn't seen his face,

20:16.631 --> 20:18.205
so how could I prove it?

20:18.340 --> 20:20.725
They'd never believe
how I knew it was him.

20:26.845 --> 20:29.400
Kyle, what's wrong? Did you see the guy?

20:32.187 --> 20:33.232
No.

20:34.087 --> 20:35.440
But I had heard him...

20:35.538 --> 20:36.767
and lost him...

20:37.256 --> 20:39.247
and let Amanda down again.

20:52.641 --> 20:53.809
You okay?

20:55.752 --> 20:57.781
Didn't go so well at the police station?

20:58.457 --> 20:59.502
No.

21:00.306 --> 21:02.317
I thought if I could help
get the bracelet back...

21:02.403 --> 21:04.521
She'd forgive you for not
telling her about Charlie?

21:06.527 --> 21:08.003
I know, It's doesn't make any sense.

21:08.298 --> 21:09.377
It totally does.

21:09.457 --> 21:10.819
You want a second chance.

21:10.905 --> 21:12.871
But all I do is disappoint her.

21:14.575 --> 21:17.698
This is not happening.
You cannot end up like me and Declan.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.677
This is different.

21:20.095 --> 21:21.976
Amanda and I are just friends.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.202
At least we used to be.

21:25.223 --> 21:28.016
You've been crushing hard
on her ever since you saw her.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.300
At least since that day at the pool,
if you know what I mean.

21:32.386 --> 21:33.505
Don't remind me.

21:33.714 --> 21:35.583
Tell her how you really feel.

21:38.249 --> 21:39.601
This is the wrong time.

21:39.712 --> 21:41.790
Well, if you can't tell her,
then show her.

21:41.876 --> 21:42.970
Get her bracelet back.

21:44.335 --> 21:45.822
How am I supposed to do that?

21:46.692 --> 21:48.782
Do I look like the one with the 300 IQ?

21:53.147 --> 21:56.233
Man, I cannot wait to get
behind the wheel of this baby.

21:56.479 --> 21:57.903
Oh, yes, you can.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.954
You wanna talk to me about the pot?

22:05.540 --> 22:06.639
Pot?

22:06.806 --> 22:09.110
I know you're smoking it.
I know where you're getting it.

22:09.221 --> 22:12.824
And if you think you're gonna get stoned
in my house, you must still be high.

22:14.004 --> 22:15.897
So I can get stoned
out of the house then?

22:16.119 --> 22:17.668
You're gonna joke with me now?

22:18.172 --> 22:19.795
Dad, I tried it, like, twice.

22:19.893 --> 22:22.242
- I'm not hurting anyone.
- You're hurting yourself.

22:22.684 --> 22:24.496
All it does is mellow me out.

22:24.595 --> 22:26.168
And it's fun.

22:26.297 --> 22:28.275
But I guess you and Mom
already know that.

22:28.689 --> 22:30.816
We are not talking about me or your mom.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.672
This is unbelievable.

22:33.159 --> 22:36.253
Are you gonna lecture me when you had
that shoebox stash in your closet?

22:36.339 --> 22:38.790
Don't get me started on
the invasion of privacy thing.

22:38.884 --> 22:41.368
The bottom line is you are not
getting high on my watch.

22:41.463 --> 22:42.885
What are you really pissed about?

22:43.393 --> 22:46.699
That I got high on your watch...
or high on your weed?

22:52.539 --> 22:55.037
Okay, this is the area where
all the break-ins happened.

22:55.126 --> 22:56.325
Big area.

22:56.432 --> 22:59.725
Not if you know what to look for.
Or what the robber looks for.

22:59.839 --> 23:01.315
All of the break-ins fit a pattern.

23:01.410 --> 23:03.577
They all happened between
1:00 AM and 3:00 AM.

23:03.690 --> 23:06.226
And the robber chooses houses
with secluded side entrances,

23:06.321 --> 23:07.733
like the one at Amanda's house.

23:09.752 --> 23:12.040
And all of the houses he hits
have no adult male in them.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.238
Nice. A thief and a chauvinist.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.828
He doesn't like alarms, either.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.097
And then there were five.

23:19.668 --> 23:20.861
Actually, no.

23:21.069 --> 23:22.413
He doesn't like dogs, either.

23:23.940 --> 23:25.954
How do you know
that none of these other places

23:26.034 --> 23:28.426
don't have any dogs or alarms or men?

23:28.887 --> 23:30.211
I've read the public records.

23:30.344 --> 23:31.461
Which public records?

23:33.168 --> 23:34.286
All of 'em.

23:35.931 --> 23:38.012
Well, what about our alarm?
Ever since the break-in,

23:38.092 --> 23:40.867
Mom and Dad have been setting it
at night, and I don't know the code.

23:41.182 --> 23:42.392
I can figure it out.

23:43.378 --> 23:44.453
Will you give it to me?

23:44.648 --> 23:46.400
Yes... if you help me.

23:48.061 --> 23:49.837
Fine. but if I'm going
to risk sneaking out

23:49.917 --> 23:52.679
at 1:00 in the morning,
you better be right.

23:53.904 --> 23:55.342
This is the house.

23:58.096 --> 24:00.330
This is so not the house.

24:05.016 --> 24:07.419
I can't believe I snuck out of the house

24:07.533 --> 24:09.745
and swiped Mom's car for this.

24:11.184 --> 24:12.755
How much longer will we wait out here?

24:12.850 --> 24:14.497
Just give it 10 more minutes.

24:14.610 --> 24:16.749
You said that 10 minutes ago.

24:18.710 --> 24:20.716
I promise. This is the house.

24:21.209 --> 24:24.180
You're making promises
my bladder can't keep.

24:29.540 --> 24:31.830
I guess I figured
you'd be better at this.

24:31.963 --> 24:33.420
What was that supposed to mean?

24:34.875 --> 24:38.510
When you sneak out with Declan, you
spend most time parked in a car, right?

24:38.700 --> 24:40.047
That's way different.

24:40.269 --> 24:43.467
Why, because you're in
the back seat, not the front?

24:47.806 --> 24:49.442
You made a joke.

24:50.733 --> 24:53.574
Or are just taking your frustrations out
because

24:53.667 --> 24:56.684
somebody picked the wrong house?

24:57.299 --> 24:58.676
This is the house.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.250
Kyle, it takes a big man
to admit when he's wrong.

25:03.194 --> 25:04.872
And an even bigger woman

25:04.952 --> 25:07.039
to admit when he's right.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.682
911. What's your emergency?

25:10.781 --> 25:13.861
Um, yes, I'd like to report
a robbery in progress.

25:28.710 --> 25:30.338
Hey, how's it coming?

25:30.584 --> 25:31.587
Good.

25:33.934 --> 25:36.335
I just need that new distributor cap
Josh was gonna pick up.

25:36.415 --> 25:37.416
Yeah.

25:38.660 --> 25:40.976
Well, Kyle, it looks like
you're gonna be working solo

25:41.056 --> 25:42.834
on this beast for a while.

25:43.596 --> 25:45.693
Josh tell you he was grounded?

25:45.807 --> 25:47.510
He said you went all
broken arrow on him.

25:47.624 --> 25:50.036
- Is that what he was talking about?
- Without a doubt.

25:54.333 --> 25:55.885
What else did he say?

25:56.339 --> 25:59.368
That you busted him
for smoking a big fat flank.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.945
- Well, you haven't been, have you?
- No.

26:04.847 --> 26:07.663
Didn't think so. It's not good for you.
Plus, it's against the law.

26:07.996 --> 26:10.286
Josh said he found it in your room.

26:12.707 --> 26:13.881
Yeah, well...

26:14.833 --> 26:16.234
it's complicated.

26:19.092 --> 26:21.357
If something's a crime for one person,

26:21.628 --> 26:23.816
shouldn't it be a crime for everybody?

26:34.950 --> 26:36.577
So, what's her glitch?

26:38.016 --> 26:39.852
Come on, give me the dirt
on the new girl.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.663
Drugs? Torturing animals?
Got the urge to purge?

26:43.137 --> 26:46.051
Why the sudden interest
in my patient's problems?

26:46.165 --> 26:48.796
Oh, so you admit
she does have a problem.

26:48.929 --> 26:50.007
Interesting.

26:51.408 --> 26:54.768
Fine. You wanna dodge
the question, okay by me.

26:56.470 --> 26:59.029
I don't discuss my patients Lori.
You know that.

26:59.124 --> 27:01.317
But I am willing to discuss why you're

27:01.404 --> 27:03.650
so concerned about the new girl.

27:06.285 --> 27:08.827
Yeah. Now who's dodging the question?

27:23.193 --> 27:24.883
Look, Josh, I know how you feel.

27:25.641 --> 27:26.853
No, you don't.

27:27.193 --> 27:29.420
- This is totally...
- Unfair?

27:41.793 --> 27:45.072
My father, your grandpa,
was a pretty heavy drinker.

27:45.158 --> 27:47.511
It was one of the only things
he was good at.

27:50.499 --> 27:53.111
One day, he caught me
sneaking whiskey out

27:53.205 --> 27:56.290
of his liquor cabinet,
and he tore me a new one...

27:56.726 --> 27:58.322
which, incidentally, was

27:58.408 --> 28:00.179
the other thing he was good at.

28:03.698 --> 28:08.012
Now, he was the last person that should
be lecturing me about drinking, but

28:09.110 --> 28:11.623
just because he was a hypocrite
doesn't mean he was wrong.

28:14.785 --> 28:16.564
He taught me something...

28:18.192 --> 28:20.274
without even knowing it. That...

28:22.311 --> 28:25.302
what you do is just
as important as what you say.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.643
So...

28:29.627 --> 28:32.012
if you can't smoke up, neither can I.

28:32.614 --> 28:33.945
That sound fair?

28:38.594 --> 28:41.118
Unless we both agree to keep partying.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.389
Not a chance.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.551
Hey, how'd it go?

29:03.214 --> 29:05.012
Um, well, they caught the guy.

29:05.542 --> 29:08.343
Courtesy of your friendly
neighborhood Kyle.

29:09.140 --> 29:10.149
- What?
- Kyle,

29:10.263 --> 29:12.043
data-crunched the guy's break-in pattern

29:12.123 --> 29:14.048
and CSI-ed where he was gonna rob next

29:14.168 --> 29:17.153
and then "somebody"
called in an anonymous tip.

29:17.361 --> 29:19.452
They should give us guns and badges.

29:19.565 --> 29:21.540
Or maybe just, like,
a really cool Taser.

29:23.542 --> 29:25.737
You don't look so happy about
them catching that guy.

29:26.715 --> 29:28.053
He admits he broke into the house,

29:28.133 --> 29:30.291
but he's telling the police
he didn't steal anything.

29:30.771 --> 29:32.397
He says he never even saw my bracelet.

29:32.477 --> 29:33.743
And they believed him?

29:33.865 --> 29:37.010
No, they're still charging him
with stealing it, but...

29:37.124 --> 29:38.738
They found crystal meth on him.

29:38.871 --> 29:40.536
They figure he pawned it for drug money.

29:43.447 --> 29:44.810
I'll probably never see it again.

29:54.805 --> 29:57.322
We don't even know if he
sold it to a pawn shop.

29:57.448 --> 29:58.924
What's your lucky number, Kyle?

29:59.004 --> 30:01.366
- I didn't know numbers could be lucky.
- Sure they can.

30:01.460 --> 30:03.984
And for a lot of people,
their lucky number is seven.

30:04.097 --> 30:06.387
That's how many pawn shops
we've been to.

30:06.504 --> 30:07.655
No, really?

30:08.829 --> 30:11.946
So you think because seven's a lucky
number, we might find her bracelet here?

30:12.041 --> 30:15.266
I'm just saying yes, there's a good
chance we won't, but we might get lucky.

30:15.356 --> 30:16.397
You can't give up hope.

30:16.511 --> 30:17.687
- Is that it?
- Well,

30:17.788 --> 30:20.219
- that's not all it is...
- No. Is that it?

30:20.408 --> 30:22.273
Can I help you two find something?

30:22.386 --> 30:23.446
This bracelet.

30:23.541 --> 30:26.544
It was stolen from our neighbor's house
a couple of nights ago.

30:26.676 --> 30:30.598
Impossible. That bracelet's been in
this store going on there weeks now.

30:30.712 --> 30:32.191
No, that'simpossible.

30:32.343 --> 30:35.483
The robbery happened Sunday night. The
man who sold you this bracelet stole it

30:35.582 --> 30:37.054
from our neighbor's house.

30:37.149 --> 30:38.364
I'm not a fence, lady.

30:38.459 --> 30:40.180
I don't deal in stolen merchandise.

30:41.222 --> 30:43.020
Let's see if the cops agree.

30:44.124 --> 30:45.485
Okay, easy, Veronica Mars.

30:45.565 --> 30:48.059
I don't need another headache
with the cops, all right?

30:53.861 --> 30:56.057
Well, it looks like
you're wrong on both counts.

30:56.152 --> 30:59.242
That bracelets been in the store
three weeks and two days,

30:59.322 --> 31:01.139
and it wasn't pawned by a man.

31:01.253 --> 31:02.292
It was a woman.

31:02.908 --> 31:04.173
No way.

31:04.820 --> 31:06.334
I can't believe it.

31:07.053 --> 31:09.060
Amanda's mom sold her bracelet.

31:18.622 --> 31:20.617
Why would Mrs. Bloom
pawn Amanda's bracelet

31:20.712 --> 31:22.793
and then say it was stolen
during the robbery?

31:22.906 --> 31:25.252
I guess that way she could get
the money for selling it,

31:25.343 --> 31:27.893
plus the insurance money
for reporting it stolen.

31:28.030 --> 31:29.923
She shouldn't be allowed to do that.

31:30.037 --> 31:31.512
Apparently, she can.

31:31.644 --> 31:33.215
Unless we turn her in.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.035
I don't want to get
Amanda's mom in trouble.

31:36.147 --> 31:38.795
Good way to repay her
for all the kindness she's shown you.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.498
But I guess not the best way
to get back into Amanda's good graces.

31:44.593 --> 31:46.921
I just want Amanda to have
the bracelet her dad gave her.

31:47.015 --> 31:48.617
I wish there was a way we could do it

31:48.711 --> 31:51.202
so that Amanda doesn't know
her mother hocked it.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.472
Maybe there is.

31:57.478 --> 32:00.561
So, is it time to send in Worse Cop?

32:01.321 --> 32:04.565
Actually, Worse Cop is off the clock.
Bad Cop had a talk with our suspect,

32:04.659 --> 32:06.420
and he's agreed not to smoke up anymore.

32:06.542 --> 32:08.643
Wow. How'd you get him to do that?

32:08.757 --> 32:12.002
- By promising him I wouldn't either.
- Big sacrifice.

32:12.116 --> 32:14.048
I can't even rember the last
time you got high.

32:14.467 --> 32:17.045
Well, marijuana does cause memory loss.

32:17.158 --> 32:18.162
Funny.

32:18.275 --> 32:19.749
Well, all that stuff ever made me do

32:19.829 --> 32:21.901
was eat half the refrigerator
and fall asleep.

32:21.995 --> 32:24.059
So my ass certainly won't miss it.

32:24.286 --> 32:26.311
- What are you looking for?
- My blue dress shirt.

32:26.406 --> 32:27.607
I have a job interview.

32:27.687 --> 32:29.012
- Already?
- Yeah. I got a call

32:29.092 --> 32:31.311
- from that corporate headhunter.
- What's the job?

32:31.424 --> 32:34.923
Some big company wants someone to head
up their experimental software division.

32:35.093 --> 32:37.544
It's pretty much something
I've always wanted to do.

32:37.639 --> 32:40.437
Maybe LWK going under is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

32:40.517 --> 32:41.874
Besides me, of course.

32:42.606 --> 32:43.628
Of course.

32:43.988 --> 32:45.711
So when do they want to see you?

32:45.824 --> 32:47.319
Uh, they're setting it up right away.

32:47.508 --> 32:49.325
Stephen, that is so great.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.893
- Yeah.
- And you don't even have to worry

32:51.987 --> 32:53.937
if they give you a drug test.

32:59.273 --> 33:00.996
I'm here for the charm bracelet.

33:02.548 --> 33:05.947
- How much you got to spend?
- Not spend.Trade.

33:07.561 --> 33:10.258
That bracelet didn't exactly
come out of a gumball machine.

33:10.409 --> 33:13.494
If you wanna trade,
you better have something of...

33:14.409 --> 33:15.412
value.

33:16.339 --> 33:17.858
That's a beautiful stone.

33:18.374 --> 33:19.345
Do you mind?

33:19.425 --> 33:22.915
It was a gift from Adam Baylin,
and it meant a lot to me...

33:23.076 --> 33:24.590
but so does Amanda.

33:29.755 --> 33:30.788
Tell you what.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.394
I'm in a good mood. Even trade.

33:36.099 --> 33:37.140
All right.

33:42.349 --> 33:43.537
Here you go.

33:45.605 --> 33:46.709
I'll be back for that.

33:47.564 --> 33:48.873
I'll be here.

34:08.152 --> 34:09.308
Amanda's not home.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.812
Actually, I'm here to see you.

34:13.194 --> 34:15.094
I know you sold Amanda's bracelet.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.460
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:20.983 --> 34:23.565
I don't have to tell her
and neither do you.

34:23.786 --> 34:27.496
I figured you could tell her you found
it, that it wasn't stolen after all.

34:27.617 --> 34:28.620
Kyle?

34:35.196 --> 34:37.081
What are you doing with my bracelet?

34:39.659 --> 34:41.281
Where did you find it?

34:48.502 --> 34:50.947
Kyle, how did you get my bracelet back?

35:04.011 --> 35:05.022
Mom...

35:06.566 --> 35:08.155
what's going on?

35:09.962 --> 35:12.217
Kyle, will you excuse us, please?

35:12.322 --> 35:14.630
I need to have a talk with Amanda.

35:16.466 --> 35:17.684
Thank you.

35:22.687 --> 35:23.698
Come on.

35:30.016 --> 35:31.149
Who's the letter for?

35:31.311 --> 35:34.564
Just someone who needs help,
even if they don't realize it.

35:37.198 --> 35:38.934
So how long are you grounded?

35:39.048 --> 35:41.892
Depends if they give me
time off for good behavior.

35:42.180 --> 35:44.600
At least they let you out of the house.

35:44.715 --> 35:46.583
'Cause they know I'm with you.

35:48.587 --> 35:50.342
I'm not gonna narc on you.

35:50.573 --> 35:53.129
Besides, I thought you were done
smoking that stuff anyway.

35:53.224 --> 35:54.827
Don't knock it 'till you rock it.

35:54.978 --> 35:57.239
You're all about expanding your mind.

35:57.496 --> 35:59.938
I can do that on my own. So can you.

36:01.125 --> 36:03.030
Not all of us have
your brain power, dude.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.541
Then you can't afford
to waste any, can you?

36:15.393 --> 36:17.174
Hey. Come on. I'll play you.

36:18.822 --> 36:20.367
I thought I was grounded.

36:20.462 --> 36:23.715
Yeah. Inmates even get
an hour of day in the yard.

36:25.275 --> 36:26.666
Look, Josh,

36:27.335 --> 36:29.285
I don't want to raise you in a prison.

36:31.021 --> 36:33.303
You become a man. There'll
be a lot of bumps in the road.

36:33.383 --> 36:35.292
I know where a lot of those bumps are.

36:36.134 --> 36:39.042
So if you're straight with me,
I promise I'll be straight with you.

36:39.497 --> 36:41.419
It'll make both our lives a lot easier.

36:46.342 --> 36:47.372
All right.

36:51.405 --> 36:52.618
Josh, where ya been?

36:52.729 --> 36:55.775
That ganja really must have
put you in dry-dock.

36:57.823 --> 37:00.549
Hey, man, who's "Itchy-Trager Finger?"

37:05.549 --> 37:07.164
that's my dad.

37:15.887 --> 37:17.190
So you still wanna play me?

37:18.321 --> 37:21.473
Hey, just 'cause I can't smoke pot
doesn't mean I can't smoke you.

37:28.691 --> 37:31.930
Go mow the lawn. Now.

37:36.210 --> 37:40.223
Yes, sir. I think our
patient's first session went very well.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.775
- Has she met the boy?
- Not yet.

37:44.073 --> 37:46.377
Find out who he knows,
what he does with his time.

37:46.625 --> 37:48.000
Get her into his world.

37:48.743 --> 37:50.459
Her sole focus should be Kyle.

37:50.612 --> 37:51.623
Yes, sir.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.746
By now I knew Amanda's heartbeat
well enough

38:10.826 --> 38:12.678
to know it was her outside my door.

38:16.476 --> 38:18.079
Room in there for two?

38:26.680 --> 38:29.371
I wanna thank you for
getting my bracelet back.

38:30.286 --> 38:33.052
Especially after the way
my mom treated you.

38:34.171 --> 38:35.620
Since my dad died,

38:36.764 --> 38:40.784
we've been having money troubles.
And I know that's no excuse, but

38:40.899 --> 38:42.587
at least you can see why she did it.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.025
Amanda, you don't have to
explain anything to me.

38:45.124 --> 38:47.447
But I want you to know she called
the police and told them

38:47.533 --> 38:49.050
the bracelet wasn't stolen.

38:49.197 --> 38:51.160
- That's good.
- She was just...

38:52.163 --> 38:54.553
too proud to admit that
we were in trouble.

38:55.586 --> 38:58.219
I guess she was scared of me
finding out the truth.

39:00.776 --> 39:02.841
But I'm tougher than people think.

39:04.933 --> 39:06.038
I know.

39:10.363 --> 39:12.612
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

39:14.694 --> 39:17.781
You kept my mom's secret because
you were trying to protect me.

39:19.350 --> 39:22.134
Like you were trying to protect me
by not telling me about Charlie.

39:27.264 --> 39:29.035
The really stupid part is...

39:30.259 --> 39:32.183
I wasn't even mad at you.

39:33.293 --> 39:36.954
This whole time, I was mad at myself for
almost sleeping with that stupid cheat.

39:39.810 --> 39:43.253
You mean you didn't sleep with him
the night of the bonfire?

39:43.363 --> 39:44.474
No.

39:48.925 --> 39:51.119
Kyle, you've done so much for me.

39:53.300 --> 39:54.464
Let me do this for you.

39:58.912 --> 40:02.002
It's the money my mom got
for selling the bracelet.

40:02.394 --> 40:04.244
We both want you to have it.

40:05.007 --> 40:06.408
So you can get your ring back.

40:09.800 --> 40:10.849
How did you know?

40:12.871 --> 40:16.687
Because you're the kind of
person who would give something up

40:17.325 --> 40:19.859
just to get back something
important for someone else.

40:25.610 --> 40:27.041
I can't take this.

40:37.868 --> 40:39.604
You know how you said...

40:41.302 --> 40:44.547
you just wanted things to go back
to the way that they were?

40:47.532 --> 40:49.133
That's all I want.

40:56.907 --> 40:58.674
I don't want that anymore.

41:01.601 --> 41:03.528
I want things to be better.

41:11.290 --> 41:13.417
As I held Amanda in my arms,

41:13.895 --> 41:17.252
I realized that as much
as I liked to hear her heartbeat,

41:17.505 --> 41:19.622
it was even better to feel it.

41:23.955 --> 41:26.587
I guess mistakes are
really second chances,

41:26.702 --> 41:29.497
even if they don't seem
that way at the time.

41:38.309 --> 41:41.158
The thief didn't know it, but the drugs
had damaged his heart,

41:41.272 --> 41:44.116
giving him the irregular
heartbeat that gave him away.

41:47.943 --> 41:49.545
But getting caught...

41:50.709 --> 41:52.230
just might have saved his life.

41:56.969 --> 41:59.361
It's not in there, kid. Your ring?

41:59.740 --> 42:00.750
I sold it.

42:01.638 --> 42:02.779
Sold it?

42:03.336 --> 42:04.786
It's the damnedest things.

42:04.881 --> 42:07.756
I haven't sold a ring out of that case
in... gotta be six months.

42:08.663 --> 42:10.743
Couldn't keep yours in there
more than a few hours.

42:10.852 --> 42:11.864
Who bought it?

42:13.008 --> 42:16.074
Someone who paid me a lot of
money to lose the receipt.

42:23.396 --> 42:26.239
That means a lot to me, sir.
I can't wait to be a part of the team.

42:26.334 --> 42:29.765
Well, you won't have to.
We want you to start right away.

42:30.204 --> 42:31.730
Welcome to Madacorp.

42:34.775 --> 42:35.980
