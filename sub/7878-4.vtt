00:33.225 --> 00:34.787
This place seems
great, huh, Stan?

00:35.094 --> 00:36.544
I couldn't disagree
with you more.

00:36.628 --> 00:38.463
Don't like the chairs,
hate the cutlery.

00:38.530 --> 00:39.797
Food looks boring.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.265
The waiter's ugly.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.218
Let me get you guys
some spit bread.

00:44.303 --> 00:47.472
Stan, you find fault
with every restaurant we go to.

00:47.523 --> 00:49.424
Can't we just once
have a nice meal

00:49.491 --> 00:51.059
without you criticizing
everything?

00:51.143 --> 00:52.393
I'm not criticizing
everything.

00:52.478 --> 00:54.729
I haven't said a word
about how the lighting in here

00:54.813 --> 00:56.064
makes you look like
John Madden.

00:56.148 --> 00:58.616
You look jowly here,
eyes look sunken here,

00:58.684 --> 01:00.668
and boom, you're working
on a second chin.

01:00.736 --> 01:03.304
Cat whiskers.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.492
Why can't we find
a single restaurant

01:07.543 --> 01:08.709
that's good enough
for you?!

01:08.794 --> 01:10.027
What the hell?!

01:10.079 --> 01:11.829
Oh, the hell? You
want the hell, huh?!

01:11.880 --> 01:13.247
I'll tell you the hell!

01:13.332 --> 01:15.967
Take the wheel while
I look off reflectively.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.337
I was eight years old,
and my dad had just left us.

01:19.388 --> 01:21.889
I thought
I'd never be happy again.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.875
Come on, Stan.

01:23.942 --> 01:25.910
<i>Little did I know</i>
<i>she was taking me</i>

01:25.978 --> 01:27.311
<i>to the happiest place on Earth.</i>

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:36.388 --> 01:39.056
Hey, little guy! I heard
your dad walked out on you

01:39.124 --> 01:41.042
'cause he didn't love you enough
to stay.

01:41.110 --> 01:43.177
But I know
what'll make you feel better.

01:43.245 --> 01:45.229
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>I was a hundred percent sure</i>

01:45.297 --> 01:47.615
<i>I was going to be molested,</i>
<i>but it was even better.</i>

01:47.683 --> 01:49.484
Forget about the menu.

01:49.551 --> 01:51.302
Tonight, you can have
whatever you want.

01:51.370 --> 01:52.904
Can I have a
licorice burrito?

01:52.971 --> 01:54.372
Now you're talking!

01:54.439 --> 01:56.224
<i>That was a magical night.</i>

01:56.291 --> 01:57.875
<i>I had chocolate-covered</i>
<i>hot dogs.</i>

01:57.943 --> 01:59.627
<i>I had cherry-pie pizza.</i>

01:59.695 --> 02:03.147
<i>I had the third-worst</i>
<i>diarrhea of my young life.</i>

02:03.215 --> 02:04.782
<i>We closed the place down</i>
<i>that night.</i>

02:04.850 --> 02:06.434
<i>It was the best dinner ever.</i>

02:06.502 --> 02:08.301
Come back any time!

02:09.655 --> 02:12.423
I'll always be here
for you, Stan!

02:16.895 --> 02:18.762
So you weren't molested?

02:18.814 --> 02:21.032
No, that wasn't till
four or five years later.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.301
It was my first week
at Christian camp.

02:23.368 --> 02:25.769
<i>But I'm not ready</i>
<i>to talk about Father Roy.</i>

02:25.821 --> 02:27.955
<i>Boy, he had a set</i>
<i>of paws on him.</i>

02:28.040 --> 02:29.824
<i>What a summer.</i>

02:29.908 --> 02:32.660
Anyway, no restaurant has
ever been as good or as fun.

02:32.744 --> 02:34.245
That's why I'm
always so critical.

02:34.296 --> 02:36.047
I just know I
could do it better.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.215
Then why don't you?

02:37.282 --> 02:38.449
Open up your own restaurant!

02:38.500 --> 02:39.717
But I couldn't do that.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.302
I don't know
the first thing

02:41.386 --> 02:42.386
about the restaurant
business.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.804
Whoa, whoa, pull over!

02:43.889 --> 02:46.007
I think I just saw Roger
in a lawn chair.

02:47.242 --> 02:49.143
Roger, what
are you doing?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.512
Signing <i>you</i> up for an
adult literacy class.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.315
"Nocturnal...
petting... zoo."

02:55.450 --> 02:56.634
Get out of here!

02:56.685 --> 02:57.985
I warned you, Dugan!

02:58.070 --> 03:01.022
Sorry if I was a little
curt with you before.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.690
These junkies
got me on edge.

03:02.758 --> 03:04.926
What do you know
about working with animals?

03:04.993 --> 03:06.711
Nothing. When I get something
in my mind,

03:06.778 --> 03:07.845
I always make it happen.

03:07.913 --> 03:09.380
And I stick to it, too.

03:09.448 --> 03:11.465
No, I don't stick to it.
That's not believable.

03:11.533 --> 03:12.767
But the first part's true.

03:12.834 --> 03:15.820
Dugan, there's urine
in this bottle!

03:15.888 --> 03:18.589
Stan, Roger's the
perfect guy to talk to

03:18.657 --> 03:20.558
about your dream of
opening a restaurant.

03:20.626 --> 03:23.160
He's always doing new things
he knows nothing about.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.915
Do you know where
the office is?

03:27.983 --> 03:29.100
It's right down there.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.251
You new or something?

03:30.319 --> 03:32.353
Yeah. I got kicked
out of my old school

03:32.421 --> 03:33.788
for having too much sex.

03:33.855 --> 03:34.956
Oh, tingle.

03:35.023 --> 03:36.257
My name's Ashley.

03:36.325 --> 03:38.259
My mom's going out
of town next week.

03:38.327 --> 03:39.560
Why don't you come over?

03:39.628 --> 03:40.828
Yes!

03:40.896 --> 03:42.396
Oh, wait.
I just remembered

03:42.464 --> 03:44.732
I promised my best friend
Julie we'd hang out.

03:44.816 --> 03:48.052
Unless you could
bring a friend for her.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.121
Oh! Oh-oh,
yeah. No prob!

03:50.188 --> 03:52.573
Great. Oh, and just
so you know,

03:52.641 --> 03:54.442
I end up going
all the way

03:54.509 --> 03:56.077
on the first date
every time.

03:56.144 --> 03:57.345
Is that okay?

03:57.412 --> 03:58.713
With me, it is.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.548
I would not tell
anyone else that.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.850
Every other boy here
would be furious.

04:07.089 --> 04:09.206
Hey, Roger.

04:09.258 --> 04:10.925
Uh, what you doing?

04:11.009 --> 04:12.176
Sorry, Stan.

04:12.227 --> 04:14.245
I'm under the gun
on this repair order.

04:14.313 --> 04:17.048
I didn't think the demand for 17th
century ironwork was this brisk.

04:17.115 --> 04:18.716
When did you
learn how to weld?

04:18.784 --> 04:20.334
This morning. Didn't
even read the manual.

04:20.402 --> 04:21.535
Just dove right in.

04:21.603 --> 04:22.970
See? Why can't I do that?

04:23.038 --> 04:24.205
You can.

04:24.273 --> 04:25.489
Don't be afraid. Here.

04:29.278 --> 04:30.861
Turn it off.

04:30.912 --> 04:32.897
Listen, I'm actually here

04:32.965 --> 04:35.066
'cause I want to
open a restaurant.

04:35.133 --> 04:36.901
A restaurant? Why?

04:38.904 --> 04:41.138
Well, when I was
eight years old,

04:41.206 --> 04:43.040
my dad walked out on us.

04:43.108 --> 04:46.877
Oh, my God,
your story has moved me!

04:46.945 --> 04:49.180
You have to open
a restaurant just like that!

04:49.247 --> 04:50.448
I don't know if I can.

04:50.515 --> 04:51.549
I know you can.

04:51.616 --> 04:53.017
I'll help you.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.885
I'll help you so much.

04:54.953 --> 04:56.787
All you need is confidence.

04:56.855 --> 04:58.022
Hit it!

04:58.090 --> 04:59.573
♪ Well... ♪

04:59.641 --> 05:02.393

05:02.444 --> 05:06.897

05:06.965 --> 05:08.766
Bravo! Bravo!

05:08.817 --> 05:10.568
I'm so glad you liked it.

05:10.619 --> 05:11.569
Let's do this.

05:11.620 --> 05:12.636
For you.

05:12.704 --> 05:14.005
You were fantastic.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.991
Oh... these are cheap.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.494
Restaurants are
a tricky business,

05:20.562 --> 05:22.330
and it doesn't look
like you've worked

05:22.397 --> 05:24.165
in the industry before.

05:24.232 --> 05:26.000
Mr. Smith, I'm sorry,

05:26.068 --> 05:28.002
but I don't think
I can approve this loan.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.820
But, sir, please!

05:29.888 --> 05:31.188
Roger, wait.

05:31.256 --> 05:33.791
Do some of the confi-dance.

05:33.842 --> 05:36.861
Okay, listen to me and everybody
lives a lot longer!

05:36.928 --> 05:38.045
Oh, my God!

05:38.113 --> 05:39.480
Roger what are you doing?

05:39.548 --> 05:41.132
I went outside
to feed the meter.

05:41.199 --> 05:42.933
It's cold out there.

05:43.001 --> 05:44.635
Anyway, if you want
to live longer,

05:44.703 --> 05:46.170
you have
to eat good food.

05:46.238 --> 05:48.005
Not canned and frozen foods,

05:48.073 --> 05:50.775
not foods trucked in
from out of state.

05:50.826 --> 05:52.009
No!

05:52.077 --> 05:53.944
Who believes food
should be grown locally

05:54.012 --> 05:55.046
with no pesticides?

05:55.113 --> 05:56.180
Farm to table.

05:56.248 --> 05:57.882
Plate to face.

05:57.949 --> 06:00.551
Because that's the kind of
restaurant my friend is opening.

06:00.619 --> 06:02.019
Who wants to eat
at his restaurant?

06:02.087 --> 06:03.187
Oh, yeah.
Great.

06:03.255 --> 06:04.588
I'd love that.
Plate to face.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.792
Best presentation ever.

06:07.843 --> 06:09.794
Looks like you're in business.

06:09.845 --> 06:12.279
Good morning!

06:12.347 --> 06:15.082
I'd like to open
a checking account!

06:21.824 --> 06:24.626
Roger, I was up all night
building this exact replica

06:24.694 --> 06:26.411
of what I think the restaurant
should look like.

06:26.479 --> 06:27.596
Great. It's your vision.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.097
I am here to help you
realize it.

06:30.299 --> 06:31.600
Yeah?

06:31.667 --> 06:32.751
Kill the work!

06:32.819 --> 06:34.453
I got a long-distance call here!

06:34.520 --> 06:35.454
<i>Larga distancia.</i>
<i>Larga distancia.</i>

06:35.521 --> 06:36.955
Ooh, <i>larga distancia.</i>

06:37.023 --> 06:39.424
Stan, that was the phone call
we've been waiting for.

06:39.492 --> 06:40.559
We got Qui-Lo,

06:40.626 --> 06:42.994
the Laotian midget master chef.

06:43.062 --> 06:47.299
Oh, well, I was kind of thinking
we'd keep things simple and fun.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.334
See, I made up
a sample menu.

06:49.402 --> 06:51.703
Wow, what's, what's
a ravioli burger?

06:51.771 --> 06:53.705
It's a hamburger
with all the trimmings

06:53.773 --> 06:55.941
slumbering
inside a giant ravioli.

06:56.008 --> 06:58.009
Oh, my God,

06:58.077 --> 07:00.812
you and I are going
to get so fat.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.714
Average American fat.

07:02.782 --> 07:04.282
And Qui-Lo, that hunky
little potsticker?

07:04.350 --> 07:06.017
He could cook this
stuff in his sleep.

07:06.085 --> 07:07.352
Are you sure?

07:07.420 --> 07:09.221
Trust me. I know
the restaurant business.

07:09.288 --> 07:12.257
I managed a Hardee's
in Myrtle Beach for three years.

07:12.325 --> 07:14.526
Everyone called it
"Party Hardee's" 'cause

07:14.594 --> 07:16.895
of the buttload of drugs
I was moving through there.

07:16.963 --> 07:18.697
I was "sick" the day
of the raid.

07:18.765 --> 07:20.499
Got tipped off by this detective

07:20.566 --> 07:22.184
whose daughter I saved
from drowning.

07:22.251 --> 07:23.819
But I-I can't go back there.

07:23.886 --> 07:25.587
He won't look
the other way again.

07:27.757 --> 07:29.024
So did your girl say

07:29.092 --> 07:30.659
my girl was hot
and slutty, too?

07:30.726 --> 07:31.960
She didn't say,

07:32.028 --> 07:33.495
but hot sluts hang
out together.

07:33.563 --> 07:34.629
Excellent.

07:34.697 --> 07:35.997
I'll use the condom first.

07:36.065 --> 07:38.150
Hey, guys.
Come on in.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.621
You must be Snot.

07:42.688 --> 07:44.356
Yeah, yeah.
So where's Julia at?

07:44.423 --> 07:45.690
She's right here.

07:48.161 --> 07:49.494
She's a doll.

07:49.562 --> 07:51.396
Yeah, she's super cute.

07:51.464 --> 07:52.664
Everybody says so.

07:52.732 --> 07:54.816
What's that, Julia? Ah.

07:54.901 --> 07:57.102
She says she likes Jews.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.537
Okay, wait a second.

07:58.604 --> 07:59.654
You know that's not a real...

08:02.125 --> 08:03.909
So, Julia seems great.

08:03.976 --> 08:06.278
Steve, can I talk
to you for a second?

08:07.647 --> 08:08.880
I'm out of here.

08:08.948 --> 08:10.615
Okay, so Ashley's
crazy as hell,

08:10.683 --> 08:11.950
but she's good to go.

08:12.018 --> 08:14.269
You have to do this for me.

08:14.337 --> 08:17.489
How many chocolate bars did I buy so your
Hebrew school could go to Mount Vernon?!

08:17.557 --> 08:20.058
11.

08:22.795 --> 08:25.013
Well, I leased the restaurant
truck like you wanted!

08:25.097 --> 08:26.631
Is it Arctic White?

08:26.699 --> 08:28.683
Yeah. It's weird
how white it is.

08:28.768 --> 08:30.268
Weirder than one
of those white dog poos.

08:30.336 --> 08:32.070
Oh, yeah, those are weird.

08:32.138 --> 08:34.222
Have you ever seen
a dog lay one of those?

08:34.307 --> 08:36.241
No. Just seen them on the grass.
Me, too.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.226
Maybe, maybe they
come out brown

08:38.311 --> 08:40.445
and it's some sort of mold or
fungus that turns them white.

08:40.511 --> 08:43.048
Like if you cracked one open,
it might be brown on the inside?

08:43.115 --> 08:44.516
Like a powdered
chocolate donut.

08:44.584 --> 08:46.535
Mmm... Now you're
making me hungry.

08:46.602 --> 08:47.736
How's my dream coming?

08:47.803 --> 08:48.920
I've been running
around so much,

08:48.988 --> 08:50.572
I haven't had
a chance to see...

08:50.640 --> 08:51.706
It's still drying.

08:51.774 --> 08:53.208
Hey, want to come with me?

08:53.276 --> 08:55.544
I'm heading to the organic
farm to choose the produce

08:55.611 --> 08:57.529
for your Cap'n Crunch
vegetable tempura.

08:57.597 --> 08:59.281
Sounds good.
I'll fire up the truck.

08:59.348 --> 09:01.383
Great. I'll follow you on
my scooter if that's okay.

09:03.636 --> 09:05.520
This is amazing.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.422
I can't believe
I'm opening my own restaurant.

09:07.490 --> 09:08.673
You're doing it, buddy.

09:08.741 --> 09:10.108
You're living
your dream.

09:10.176 --> 09:11.710
Not a lot of people
can say that.

09:11.777 --> 09:13.511
Oh, no, look at this.

09:13.579 --> 09:16.548
I got strawberry all over
my brand-new white Keds.

09:16.616 --> 09:19.718
Looks like I just bought a
$45 pair of knock-around shoes.

09:19.785 --> 09:22.821
Roger, I really want
to thank you for helping me.

09:22.889 --> 09:25.290
The truth is, I...
I was always afraid.

09:25.358 --> 09:27.943
I thought it was better to keep
this restaurant idea in my head

09:28.010 --> 09:29.411
because if I tried and failed,

09:29.478 --> 09:30.845
I wouldn't even have my dream
anymore.

09:32.381 --> 09:34.599
Oh God! Farmer Ted,
what's wrong with the cow?

09:34.667 --> 09:36.251
Not a thing.

09:36.319 --> 09:37.919
She's about to
give birth is all.

09:37.987 --> 09:40.922
Oh, that's so damn beautiful.

09:40.990 --> 09:43.792
Promise me you'll call us
when she goes into labor, okay?

09:43.859 --> 09:46.328
We want to be here.
Day or night. Uh...

09:46.395 --> 09:48.847
Here's my home number,
my cell, and the women's shelter

09:48.914 --> 09:50.832
where I'm either
volunteering

09:50.900 --> 09:52.767
or dropping off
my stupid whore wife.

09:52.835 --> 09:56.288
Soup is not a meal, Vera!

09:59.992 --> 10:02.661
Good shot.

10:02.728 --> 10:03.728
Julia's turn.

10:03.796 --> 10:07.699
Um, Snot, she's never
played before.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.567
Maybe you could teach her.

10:14.874 --> 10:16.141
Oh, she's doing it!

10:16.208 --> 10:17.892
Beginner's luck.

10:21.514 --> 10:22.831
Yo, Snotster,

10:22.898 --> 10:25.283
how about you and your lady
give us a little privacy?

10:28.120 --> 10:30.889
Stupid doll.

10:30.957 --> 10:32.707
Did you hear that?

10:32.775 --> 10:34.542
There's no blood going
to my ears, sweetheart.

10:34.610 --> 10:36.044
I'd better go
check on Julia.

10:41.233 --> 10:43.985
You took advantage of Julia!

10:44.053 --> 10:45.153
What?

10:45.221 --> 10:47.822
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.

10:47.890 --> 10:49.190
Get out!

10:49.258 --> 10:51.026
What's going...?
Both of you, get out!

10:51.093 --> 10:52.227
No, no, wait!

10:52.295 --> 10:53.328
She was a virgin!

10:53.396 --> 10:55.430
What's that, Julia?

10:55.498 --> 10:56.765
He didn't use a condom?!

10:56.832 --> 10:59.367
You didn't use a condom?

10:59.435 --> 11:01.703
Are you kidding me?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.273
Stan, I thought
I sent you

11:05.341 --> 11:06.908
to Memphis
for napkin holders.

11:06.976 --> 11:08.009
Yeah, I drove all night.

11:08.077 --> 11:09.944
Why is
the grand opening sign up?

11:10.012 --> 11:11.446
We're not opening
for three weeks.

11:11.514 --> 11:12.580
Oh, I moved it up.

11:12.648 --> 11:14.149
But I didn't do
my final walk-through.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.800
I didn't, I didn't do
any walk-through.

11:15.868 --> 11:17.035
Well, no time
like the present.

11:17.103 --> 11:18.636
Take a look. Ta-dah!

11:18.704 --> 11:21.022
Ow! Ow! Did I sprain my wrists?

11:21.107 --> 11:22.223
No, they're fine.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.743
Oh!
No, no. No, I didn't.

11:28.364 --> 11:29.481
What is this?!

11:29.532 --> 11:31.366
Your dream restaurant:

11:31.434 --> 11:33.752
Roger's Laotian Adventure.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.553
But what about
my scale model?

11:35.621 --> 11:37.422
Stan, it took quite
a bit of doing,

11:37.490 --> 11:39.591
but I managed to wipe
my butt with it.

11:39.658 --> 11:40.725
What?
Look, it's time

11:40.793 --> 11:41.910
for some opening-
night honesty.

11:41.977 --> 11:43.278
Your ideas
are terrible.

11:43.346 --> 11:44.379
I've done you a favor.

11:45.481 --> 11:46.414
Qui-Lo, shut up!

11:46.482 --> 11:48.083
I'm trying to talk here.

11:52.588 --> 11:55.073
Wow, Qui-Lo's
freakin' fired up.

11:55.141 --> 11:56.157
This isn't my menu!

11:56.225 --> 11:58.309
Where's the Raisinet carbonara?

11:58.377 --> 11:59.377
Where's the ravioli burger?

11:59.445 --> 12:00.912
Where is it?

12:00.980 --> 12:02.947
It's in your head
where it belongs.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.616
Because it's stupid.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.985
It's in your
stupid head.

12:07.053 --> 12:08.536
You son of a bitch!

12:08.604 --> 12:09.637
You insult my mother?!

12:09.705 --> 12:11.673
If you had half
the culinary talent

12:11.741 --> 12:12.991
she had in her
little finger...!

12:14.009 --> 12:15.143
What?!

12:15.211 --> 12:16.778
Oh, my God!

12:20.049 --> 12:22.200
Oh! Oh!

12:22.268 --> 12:23.901
It's a girl!
Oh!

12:26.205 --> 12:27.939
She's so beautiful!

12:29.408 --> 12:31.426
Oh, look at that!

12:31.510 --> 12:32.927
Would you look
at that!

12:55.851 --> 12:57.819
...in my mother's
little finger

12:57.887 --> 12:59.621
than you have in
your entire body,

12:59.688 --> 13:00.789
you no-talent hack!

13:00.856 --> 13:02.390
You know what?
You're fired!

13:02.458 --> 13:04.426
You can't fire me
from my own restaurant!

13:04.493 --> 13:06.027
Actually,
it's all mine.

13:06.095 --> 13:08.029
The bank wouldn't
lend you 50 cents!

13:08.097 --> 13:10.231
The restaurant, the truck,
the napkin holders,

13:10.299 --> 13:11.332
they're all mine!

13:11.400 --> 13:13.234
But to show you
I'm a good guy,

13:13.302 --> 13:15.804
I got you this. Ta-dah!

13:15.871 --> 13:16.888
The perfect split.

13:16.956 --> 13:17.922
You like that?

13:17.990 --> 13:19.190
Get off my property.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.951
I can't believe
Roger fired you!

13:27.018 --> 13:29.453
He told me all my
ideas were stupid.

13:29.521 --> 13:31.255
You can't let him steal
your dream.

13:31.323 --> 13:32.389
It's too late, Francine.

13:32.457 --> 13:33.924
It's already done.

13:33.992 --> 13:36.227
I'm gonna grab
some shut-eye.

13:36.311 --> 13:38.646
Maybe dream a new dream!

13:41.733 --> 13:43.217
Francine, we've
been driving for hours.

13:43.268 --> 13:45.319
Are we at
the frozen yogurt place yet?

13:45.386 --> 13:46.821
Actually, Stan,
that was a trick.

13:46.888 --> 13:48.388
We're in Philadelphia.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.523
Take a look.

13:49.574 --> 13:51.909
Does this bring
back any memories?

13:51.977 --> 13:53.978
Oh, you want me
to confront Father Roy

13:54.045 --> 13:55.379
about what happened
at camp.

13:55.447 --> 13:58.716
Thing is, I'm not sure
it was entirely his fault.

13:58.784 --> 14:00.684
I may have deserved it.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.987
In fact, I <i>may</i>
have instigated it.

14:03.054 --> 14:05.606
Actually, Francine,
I seduced <i>him.</i>

14:05.674 --> 14:08.425
<i>I don't know why I wanted him,</i>
<i>but I wanted him.</i>

14:08.510 --> 14:09.777
<i>There was no actual</i>

14:09.845 --> 14:11.011
inser...
Stan, no!

14:11.079 --> 14:12.746
This isn't about that!

14:12.814 --> 14:14.882
This wasn't
always a church.

14:14.950 --> 14:17.318
This used to be
Mr. Johnson's restaurant.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.254
Remember the dinner
you had here?

14:20.322 --> 14:22.256
Remember what
it meant to you?

14:22.324 --> 14:25.192
Don't let Roger steal
that dream from you.

14:28.613 --> 14:31.115
Clearly there's some kind
of natural gas leak.

14:31.183 --> 14:32.766
They really have
to stop building here.

14:36.538 --> 14:38.005
Ashley, come on!

14:38.073 --> 14:39.640
It was all a big
misunderstanding.

14:39.708 --> 14:40.808
Really?

14:40.876 --> 14:43.110
Well, is it a
misunderstanding

14:43.161 --> 14:44.795
that Julia's
period is late?!

14:44.863 --> 14:47.431
What?
I don't blame
Snot, okay?

14:47.499 --> 14:50.484
Julia told me <i>she</i> was
the one who jumped <i>him.</i>

14:50.552 --> 14:53.120
Great! So you and I can
pick up where we left off.

14:53.188 --> 14:56.690
Oh, I wish, but I really just
need to be with Julia right now.

14:56.758 --> 14:59.460
She decided not
to keep the baby.

14:59.528 --> 15:01.161
Oh, wow.

15:01.229 --> 15:02.730
Well, uh, Snot and I

15:02.797 --> 15:04.765
are gonna give you
our complete support.

15:04.833 --> 15:07.535
Aw, I knew
you were a sweetie.

15:07.602 --> 15:11.071
And soon I'm gonna
taste that sweetness.

15:12.657 --> 15:13.958
Ah!

15:14.025 --> 15:16.026
This cold locker ought to
relieve my swelling.

15:19.097 --> 15:21.432
Qui-Lo, open the damn door!

15:25.503 --> 15:26.570
Lovers' quarrel?

15:26.638 --> 15:27.905
What the hell
are you doin?

15:27.973 --> 15:29.106
I fired you.

15:29.174 --> 15:31.041
I got a loan
from Francine's parents,

15:31.109 --> 15:32.977
and I'm opening a restaurant
next door.

15:33.044 --> 15:34.778
It's gonna kick your ass.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.414
Ha! <i>You</i> open a restaurant?

15:37.482 --> 15:39.083
You couldn't open

with a wheel of cheese.

15:40.418 --> 15:42.052
Well, I've got some help.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.438
He's late 'cause
he has to quit first.

15:48.509 --> 15:49.676
Fine, quit!

15:49.728 --> 15:51.328
You're a bum, Qui-Lo!

15:51.396 --> 15:53.030
You think you can
treat people like this

15:53.098 --> 15:54.565
because you've got
everything going for you?!

15:54.633 --> 15:57.217
Well, obviously you can
because I'm fine with you,

15:57.285 --> 15:59.920
and I'll be rooting for you
in the bike race this Friday!

16:02.324 --> 16:03.924

Stan!

16:19.424 --> 16:20.808
It's a whoopee cushion.

16:20.875 --> 16:23.043

Julia's situation

17:25.707 --> 17:27.374
put you off of sex.

17:27.442 --> 17:29.643
We should take our time
and do it safely.

17:29.711 --> 17:31.211
This bush looks great.

17:33.732 --> 17:35.199
Are you okay?

17:35.266 --> 17:37.935
Oh, Jules,
it's behind you now.

17:38.003 --> 17:41.071
Everything's
gonna be fine.

17:41.139 --> 17:42.940
What did you actually
do in there?

17:43.008 --> 17:44.074
Nothing.
I went in,

17:44.142 --> 17:45.876
gave my number
to any girl

17:45.944 --> 17:47.444
who wasn't crying,
and came back out.

17:47.512 --> 17:50.014
So, now that
everything's taken care of,

17:50.081 --> 17:51.982
you and I can get
some sex going.

17:52.050 --> 17:55.486
No. Julia's just
so emotional right now,

17:55.553 --> 17:59.089
and I just have to spend
all of my time with her.

17:59.157 --> 18:00.958
We have to get rid of that doll!

18:01.026 --> 18:03.043
No way! I'm done!

18:03.111 --> 18:04.528
Mount Vernon, dude.

18:04.612 --> 18:06.547
I hated that trip!

18:06.614 --> 18:08.866
I pooed my pants
on the bus ride there.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.934
That's a long time

18:11.002 --> 18:12.669
to pretend you don't
smell anything.

18:12.737 --> 18:14.505
Don't go in there!

18:14.589 --> 18:15.989
Come eat
at my restaurant!

18:16.057 --> 18:17.324
Hey, Roger,
ya got the eats?

18:17.392 --> 18:19.076
Sorry, Stan,
I'm a little busy right now.

18:19.144 --> 18:20.711
You know, lunch rush.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.281
Welcome. Do you
have a reservation?

18:24.349 --> 18:25.599
Uh...
No problem.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.568
Why don't you have
a drink at the bar,

18:27.635 --> 18:29.486
and we'll see if we
can find you a table.

18:30.855 --> 18:32.923
What can I get you, Mac?

18:32.991 --> 18:34.691
Uh, I'm meeting friends at...

18:34.759 --> 18:36.193
Can I use
your crapper?

18:36.261 --> 18:37.327
Get out of here!

18:37.395 --> 18:38.529
There's a bathroom
in the park!

18:38.596 --> 18:39.630
The service here sucks!

18:39.697 --> 18:41.265
Have you even
seen a waiter?

18:41.332 --> 18:43.317
What am I doing?
This isn't helping me.

18:45.587 --> 18:47.554
Macaroni and sweet tarts!

18:47.622 --> 18:49.890
WAITER & COOKS:
Macaroni and sweet tarts!
Stacks!

18:52.327 --> 18:53.844
MAN
Gah! Good God!

18:53.912 --> 18:55.546
There's a cockroach
in my salad!

18:56.581 --> 18:57.965
I'm terribly sorry!

18:58.032 --> 18:59.066
Wait a second.

18:59.134 --> 19:00.134
This is a food restaurant.

19:00.201 --> 19:01.135
We don't serve salad.

19:01.202 --> 19:03.137
Well, it came from your kitchen!

19:03.204 --> 19:05.639
Roger! Don't-don't worry,
everybody, it's fine.

19:05.707 --> 19:06.940
Don't eat here.

19:07.008 --> 19:08.475
There's a clean restaurant
next door.

19:08.543 --> 19:09.777
If that's really
from our kitchen,

19:09.844 --> 19:10.944
then you can eat the plate.

19:22.891 --> 19:24.358
Delicious.

19:24.425 --> 19:26.143
Tito, I need you
to fix the vibe.

19:26.211 --> 19:28.245
You know what to do.

19:28.313 --> 19:30.314
♪ ♪

19:35.303 --> 19:36.336
Hey, Ashley.

19:36.404 --> 19:38.305
I just came by
to check on Julia.

19:38.373 --> 19:39.840
That's so nice of you.

19:43.411 --> 19:45.312
Julia! No!

19:46.664 --> 19:49.216
Oh, look,
it's her suicide note.

19:49.284 --> 19:51.819
"Dear Ashley,
I'm in a better place.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.754
Have sex with Steve."

19:53.822 --> 19:56.089
Mmm, in loving memoriam

19:56.157 --> 19:58.358
to your best friend's
dying wish...

19:58.426 --> 19:59.793
Wait a minute.

19:59.861 --> 20:03.163
This... this is not
her handwriting.

20:03.231 --> 20:05.232
She was murdered!

20:05.300 --> 20:07.601
We <i>cannot</i> fool around

20:07.669 --> 20:09.903
while her killer is still
on the loose!

20:09.971 --> 20:11.939
Oh! that's it.
I'm out of here.

20:12.006 --> 20:14.291
Snot, it didn't work!

20:16.444 --> 20:17.861
You're a real weirdo!

20:17.929 --> 20:19.096
You know that?

20:22.450 --> 20:24.101
Well, my restaurant's
going under, Stan.

20:25.286 --> 20:26.453
You win.

20:26.521 --> 20:28.055
I acted like an ass.

20:28.122 --> 20:29.189
I'm sorry.

20:29.257 --> 20:30.757
You know,
I'm not even mad.

20:30.825 --> 20:32.576
In fact, I should
be thanking you.

20:32.644 --> 20:34.511
If you hadn't been
such a controlling jerk,

20:34.579 --> 20:36.897
I wouldn't have been mad
enough to try it on my own.

20:36.965 --> 20:38.398
Did you recapture
any of those feelings

20:38.466 --> 20:39.900
from when you were a kid

20:39.968 --> 20:40.901
in Mr. Johnson's
restaurant?

20:40.969 --> 20:41.985
You know, I did.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.604
It really felt good

20:43.655 --> 20:45.472
feeding the people
and making them smile.

20:45.523 --> 20:47.174
So, yeah, it was
pretty much the same.

20:47.242 --> 20:49.593
What do you say we make it
<i>exactly</i> the same?

20:49.661 --> 20:50.627
How do you mean?

20:51.663 --> 20:52.779
What the hell?!

20:52.830 --> 20:54.414
I was in over my head
financially.

20:54.482 --> 20:55.582
But why <i>my</i> place?

20:55.650 --> 20:57.117
No one will suspect

20:57.185 --> 20:59.169
a successful restaurateur
of arson, Stan.

20:59.237 --> 21:02.289
And it's spreading
to mine...

21:02.357 --> 21:03.323
right now.

21:03.391 --> 21:04.324
Oh, yeah!

21:04.392 --> 21:05.626
I'm gonna kill you!

21:05.677 --> 21:07.044
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa,
take it easy.

21:07.128 --> 21:09.046
You just, you just need
to calm down, okay?

21:09.130 --> 21:10.130
Yeah, okay.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.049
Just relax.
