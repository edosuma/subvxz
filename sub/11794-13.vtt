00:02.035 --> 00:03.836
( bell rings )

00:03.870 --> 00:07.140
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.173 --> 00:10.076
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:10.110 --> 00:13.013
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>

00:13.046 --> 00:16.383
  <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
  <i>just in time to</i>
  <i>see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.416 --> 00:20.153
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.222 --> 00:25.225
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>

00:25.258 --> 00:28.194

00:34.868 --> 00:38.672

00:53.019 --> 00:56.056
  <i>* It's all right</i>

00:59.025 --> 01:03.163
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:22.282 --> 01:25.285
   As you can see,
   school elections
   are being held this week.

01:25.318 --> 01:29.222
 My best friend Jessie Spano is
 running for
 student body president.

01:29.255 --> 01:33.259
As for me,
I only run for buses,
blondes and brunettes.

01:34.961 --> 01:37.831
   Hey, Jessie, being president
   is a waste of time.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.866
  It's like being
  a lifeguard for a birdbath.

01:39.899 --> 01:42.369
No, it isn't.
It's an important job.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.270
   I care about
   the student body.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.406
 I care about
 a student body, too--

01:47.007 --> 01:49.109
 hers.

01:49.142 --> 01:52.746
  And that's one campaign
  you're never going to win.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.114
   This is important to me.

01:54.147 --> 01:57.984
 My mother got involved in
 the '60s and she made
 such a difference.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.886
  I want to make
  a contribution too.

01:59.919 --> 02:03.056
So give your
old jeans to Goodwill.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.791
   Jessie, how long have
   we been friends?

02:04.824 --> 02:06.826
  Ever since toddler group,
  when you forgot
  your teddy bear

02:06.860 --> 02:08.294
   and borrowed my blankie.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.396
Keep Teddy out of this.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.299
 The point I'm trying to make
 is that student
 government is a joke.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.168
  I mean,
  look at the geeks who run.

02:15.201 --> 02:18.104
   - Oh, thanks, Zack.
   - Except for you.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.808
 What I'm trying
 to say is, nothing
 ever gets changed around here.

02:21.841 --> 02:23.476
   Zack, if you don't
   like the way things are,

02:23.510 --> 02:26.179
 why don't you put your money
 where your mouth is and run?

02:26.212 --> 02:27.480
   Me, run?

02:27.514 --> 02:30.350
That's like
asking Roseanne Barr
to skip a meal.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.554
   Well, well, as Faculty
   Election Advisor,

02:34.587 --> 02:37.157
   I'd like to welcome you
   to the fray, Miss Spano.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.525
  Thank you,
  Mr. Dewey.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.427
 Are you joining us
 in class, Mr. Morris?

02:40.460 --> 02:42.095
 I'll be there in a minute,
 Mr. Dewey.

02:42.128 --> 02:45.098
 I just have to go to my locker
 to get my tape recorder.

02:45.131 --> 02:48.134
   I'd hate to miss
   a single X or Y.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.104
 You make light of algebra now,
 but when you're all grown up

02:51.104 --> 02:53.973
  and your friends are making
  logarithm jokes at parties,

02:54.007 --> 02:57.243
 you won't have a clue as to
 what everybody's laughing at.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.580
 Mr. Dewey, good news.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.750
   The grant from the Student
   Government
   Foundation came through.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.752
   Hot dog.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.154
   Imagine a free trip
   to Washington DC.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.057
 For the winner of
 the student body
 election, the faculty advisor,

03:11.091 --> 03:13.326
 and most importantly
 the school principal.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.795
 I can't wait.

03:15.829 --> 03:19.799
 I'll never forget the
 last time Mrs. B
 and I went to Washington.

03:21.234 --> 03:24.804
 We got arrested
 for
 skinny-dipping in the Potomac.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.841
That's a Kodak moment.

03:29.509 --> 03:33.847
 We want this trip to be
 a surprise for the lucky
 student who wins.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.449
Then let's go to Washington
without him.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.925
 A free trip to Washington?
 No school for a week?

03:45.959 --> 03:49.162
   I think it's
   time to get involved
   and give something back.

03:49.195 --> 03:51.431
   But I'm still keeping
   Jessie's blankie.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.103
   The filing deadline
   for the school
   election is today

03:57.137 --> 04:00.173
and we have only
one name for president.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.375
 Jessie Spano.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.911
Why don't you
run too, Lisa?

04:04.944 --> 04:07.480
 I wouldn't run against Jessie.
 She's my friend.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.516
   Besides, I couldn't give
   up Saturdays.

04:09.549 --> 04:13.186
 That's when I get my
 facial and body wrap.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.921
How about you,
Slater?

04:14.954 --> 04:18.058
 Oh, I can't, sir.
 I'm her body wrapper.

04:21.327 --> 04:25.231
  Now is not the time to go
  to the bathroom. Sit tight.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.633
  I want to run, sir.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.435
- You?
- Zack?

04:28.468 --> 04:30.904
   - Morris?
   - He's good for America!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.273
   - Zack, are you serious?
   - Well, yes.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.875
  I'm inspired by the words
  of the Beach Boys,

04:35.909 --> 04:37.877
   ''Be True
   to Your School.''

04:37.911 --> 04:41.281
   Your patriotism is giving me
   ''good,
   good, good vibrations.''

04:41.314 --> 04:43.116
( bell rings )

04:43.149 --> 04:45.652
   Okay, Zack.
   What is going on?

04:45.685 --> 04:48.988
 Maybe you're right.
 Maybe it's time
 for me to be a good American.

04:49.089 --> 04:53.093
   If you were a good American,
   you'd have left
   the country years ago.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.695
 Jessie, I'm running
 and you can't stop me, okay?

04:55.729 --> 04:58.331
   Okay, Zack.
   Go ahead and run.

04:58.365 --> 05:02.135
 But I'm warning you,
 I'm going to kick your butt.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.604
Mr. Morris, would you
care to rebut?

05:07.173 --> 05:09.242
  I'll wipe her out.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.112
That's the spirit.
Let the campaign begin!

05:15.181 --> 05:17.384
And if I'm elected
student body president,

05:17.417 --> 05:20.286
   I promise to uphold
   our school constitution,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.589
   and I promise to promote
   a healthier,

05:22.622 --> 05:24.624
more productive environment
by removing

05:24.657 --> 05:26.693
  all products
  with artificial ingredients

05:26.726 --> 05:29.062
  from school vending machines.
  Thank you.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.131
  Woo!
  ( laughs )

05:31.164 --> 05:33.400
  ( light applause )

05:35.468 --> 05:38.171
 Regarding our
 school constitution--

05:38.204 --> 05:40.407
  who cares?

05:40.440 --> 05:44.110
 And as for artificial
 ingredients, I think they've
 gotten a bum rap.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.946
  Do you want to
  live a life without
  pizza, nachos, or hot dogs?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.082
   - No!
   - Never!

05:52.085 --> 05:54.087
Ladies and gentlemen,
the candidates:

05:54.087 --> 05:56.756
   Jessie Spano
   and Zack Morris.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.125
 ( applause, cheers )

06:00.093 --> 06:02.128
- Nice speech, Jessie.
- Thanks, Max.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.064
   I hope I can count
   on your support.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.335
 Thanks, Max.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.639
   Max, whose
   side are you on?

06:14.307 --> 06:15.208
  All right!

06:15.241 --> 06:17.944
You can count on me
as your right-hand man.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.048
 Thanks a lot.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.217
Hey, Jessie, can I be
your campaign manager?

06:24.250 --> 06:27.554
 You? Lisa, we don't
 have much in common.

06:27.587 --> 06:30.423
 I know you think I'm about
 as deep as a Frisbee.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.492
 But,
 Jessie, there's a lot more
 than you realize

06:32.525 --> 06:35.228
  underneath this
  adorable exterior.

06:35.261 --> 06:38.131
  Gee, I don't know.

06:38.164 --> 06:41.067
   Courtney? Chelsea?
   Will you vote for Jessie?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.168
  Like, sure.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.605
  Like, totally,
  if you want us to.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.441
Forget Federal Express.
I can deliver.

06:48.475 --> 06:52.278
Looks like I've got
a new campaign manager.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.314
 Kelly, you want to sign up
 to work for me?

06:54.347 --> 06:57.283
 - Put me down as a maybe.
 - Maybe? What does that mean?

06:57.317 --> 06:59.753
 I can't make up my mind
 between you and Zack

06:59.786 --> 07:02.722
 without getting all the
 information and listening to
 all the speeches.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.890
 It wouldn't be fair.

07:03.923 --> 07:07.394
Fair?!
What does fair have to do
with it?! We are women!

07:07.427 --> 07:09.429
  We go to the bathroom
  together!

07:09.462 --> 07:11.464
   We vote together.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.034
 - I can't believe this is you.
 - Who cares who it is?

07:14.034 --> 07:17.037
 Just vote for me. Come on, I
 voted for you for cheerleader,
 didn't I?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.372
  That's different.
  I'm one piece of a pyramid.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.474
 You're going to run the whole
 school. It's a big decision.

07:21.508 --> 07:24.144
  Oh, women!

07:24.177 --> 07:27.313
 Soon, I'll be president
 and on my way to Washington.

07:27.347 --> 07:31.217
 I hate to break it to you,
 but George Bush
 beat you to it.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.553
Screech, read my lips--

07:33.586 --> 07:36.723
 The president of the student
 body gets a free
 trip to Washington.

07:36.756 --> 07:39.759
 It's a secret.
 You tell anyone, you get this.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.327
 Hey, careful!

07:41.361 --> 07:45.198
  My doctor says my skull
  hasn't fully hardened yet.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.400
   Do me a favor and go to your
   mom's travel agency,

07:47.434 --> 07:48.702
  and get me some brochures.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.303
Okay. And Zack,

07:50.337 --> 07:53.640
 don't worry. I won't tell
 my mom what city they're for.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.713
 Hey, Slater!
 My main man!

07:59.746 --> 08:01.848
Forget it.
I'm voting for Jessie.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.718
Come on, Slater. We're men.
We go to
the bathroom together.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.120
   We vote together.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.256
   What would the world be like
   if a woman ran it?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.759
Less violent
and color-coordinated?

08:14.394 --> 08:16.329
Either you're with me
or you're not.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.565
You know, you're right.
I'm not.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.268
Hey, Jessie. You think
Zack's up to something?

08:22.302 --> 08:24.270
 He's awake, isn't he?

08:33.246 --> 08:35.280
 Sorry,
 Screech, I didn't see you,
 man. You all right?

08:35.315 --> 08:37.817
   I hope I didn't hurt you.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.054
   ''Washington After Dark:

08:42.087 --> 08:43.890
  Sipping Ale
  with the Quayles''?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.493
 What's all this for?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.961
My name is
Screech Powers.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.562
   My address is
   88 Edgemont Road.

08:49.596 --> 08:52.065
   I'd rather die than talk.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.434
   Talk about what?

08:54.467 --> 08:56.202
  I'm on a secret
  political mission,

08:56.236 --> 08:58.938
  and Zack would kill me
  if I told you
  these were for him.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.007
  Wait a minute.
  These are for Zack?

09:01.007 --> 09:04.444
 How did you know?
 Who squealed?

09:04.477 --> 09:07.847
   Why does Zack want travel
   brochures for Washington?

09:08.915 --> 09:11.785
 I can't say.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.920
  Now I can.
  It just came to me.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.289
  Zack somehow found out
  the winner of the election

09:16.322 --> 09:18.591
  goes on a trip to Washington.
  Let me down.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.293
  So that's what
  he's up to.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.495
 You aren't going to ruin
 Zack's fun, are you?

09:22.529 --> 09:25.398
  Screech, the fun
  is about to begin.

09:29.302 --> 09:33.139
 Mirror, mirror,
 on the wall,

09:33.173 --> 09:35.608
   who's the buffest
   principal of all?

09:37.177 --> 09:40.180
 You are,
 you stud muffin, you.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.616
   Slater, I was, uh,
   rapping with the mirror.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.953
 I see you're
 working out.

09:47.053 --> 09:50.156
   Always, Slater. Just thought
   I'd pump a little iron.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.892
   My body didn't get like
   this overnight, you know.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.428
  Oh, I'm sure
  it took days, sir.

09:55.462 --> 09:59.232
 It kind of gives you something
 to shoot for, doesn't it, son?

09:59.265 --> 10:01.134
  Sure does.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.371
 I just wanted to say, I hope
 you have a great
 time in Washington.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.072
   - Thank you.
   - See ya.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.341
Whoa, whoa,
wait a second.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.443
 How did you know I was
 going to Washington?

10:10.477 --> 10:12.278
  Well, Zack told me.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.181
 I guess he's just lucky
 that the year he ran

10:15.215 --> 10:17.584
 is the year there's
 a free trip.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.986
 So that's why
 he's running.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.155
 Mr. Belding,

10:22.188 --> 10:25.125
  are you saying Zack would run
  just to get out of school

10:25.158 --> 10:26.493
   and miss homework

10:26.526 --> 10:28.428
 so he could
 party his brains out?

10:28.461 --> 10:31.564
  Slater, sweet,
  innocent man-child.

10:31.598 --> 10:34.000
   Zack Morris is like
   a vacuum cleaner.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.536
  He'll suck you in
  if he can.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.238
   But I've got
   a plan of my own,

10:38.271 --> 10:42.108
  and I'm going
  to pull his plug right now.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.444
  ( woman whistling )
  Nice legs!

10:50.016 --> 10:52.285
   Just as soon
   as I get dressed.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.024
  Mr. Dewey?

10:58.058 --> 11:00.794
 - Present.
 - Mr.
 Dewey, class is almost over.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.663
  Don't be sad,
  we'll meet again tomorrow.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.100
  No, I mean,
  you know...

11:07.133 --> 11:10.070
 Oh, I forgot.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.173
   Zack would like to show
   a campaign video
   he has prepared.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.441
Does anyone have
any objections?

11:14.474 --> 11:18.078
 I object on behalf of the next
 president of the student body,

11:18.111 --> 11:20.080
 Jessica Myrtle Spano.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.148
 All: Myrtle?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.284
 Myrtle's the name
 of my turtle.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.221
 We demand equal time.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.124
 You can tell us the name
 of your turtle later.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.130
   ( patriotic music plays )

11:37.163 --> 11:40.200
  Man: <i>America is</i>
 <i>Zack Morris country.</i>

11:40.233 --> 11:42.335
- Oh, please!
- Shh!

11:42.369 --> 11:44.204
  <i>From the very</i>
  <i>beginning,</i>

11:44.237 --> 11:46.106
<i>Zack showed he had</i>
<i>much in common</i>

11:46.139 --> 11:48.541
<i>with the great leaders</i>
<i>of yesterday.</i>

11:48.575 --> 11:50.110
 <i>Zack was</i>
 <i>born a baby,</i>

11:50.143 --> 11:53.713
   <i>just like Washington,</i>
   <i>Jefferson,</i>
   <i>and Lincoln were.</i>

11:53.747 --> 11:56.416
<i>As he grew up,</i>
<i>he got taller,</i>

11:56.449 --> 12:00.387
<i>exactly as those great leaders</i>
<i>had centuries before.</i>

12:00.420 --> 12:02.589
 <i>Incredible, but true.</i>

12:02.622 --> 12:05.625
  <i>And there's more,</i>
  <i>much more</i>.

12:05.658 --> 12:09.062
<i>Zack Morris</i>
<i>is a man's man,</i>

12:09.095 --> 12:11.364
  <i>and a ladies' man,</i>

12:11.398 --> 12:13.366
 <i>a pal to the powerful</i>

12:13.400 --> 12:15.368
<i>and kind</i>
<i>to the cuddly.</i>

12:15.402 --> 12:17.070
 Oh-h!

12:17.070 --> 12:20.340
 <i>Yet he always has time</i>
 <i>for the downtrodden,</i>

12:20.373 --> 12:24.411
<i>the poor unfortunates who</i>
<i>have been cast out by society.</i>

12:25.245 --> 12:26.746
 <i>For all he has done,</i>

12:26.780 --> 12:29.215
  <i>Zack Morris has been</i>
  <i>recognized</i>

12:29.249 --> 12:31.451
<i>as a leader</i>
<i>among leaders.</i>

12:31.484 --> 12:33.353
 ( speaking foreign language )

12:35.422 --> 12:37.290
 ( speaking foreign language )

12:39.225 --> 12:40.860
 ( screaming )

12:44.264 --> 12:47.434
  <i>Thank you.</i>
  <i>But please, let's keep</i>
  <i>the fainting to a minimum.</i>

12:47.467 --> 12:50.603
  <i>I want to be your president.</i>
  <i>Remember my motto,</i>

12:50.637 --> 12:54.607
<i>"Wherever there's trouble,</i>
<i>that's where I'll be."</i>

12:54.641 --> 12:57.877
   <i>Zack Morris.</i>
   <i>Why the heck not?</i>

12:59.612 --> 13:02.115
 ( applause )

13:02.148 --> 13:03.616
   Oh, come on.
   Give us a break.

13:03.650 --> 13:07.053
 This is outrageous. He's
 making a ''mockracy''
 of ''demockery.''

13:09.622 --> 13:13.626
   Does anyone wish
   to comment on this video?

13:13.660 --> 13:17.197
  At first I was undecided,
  but now after
  watching this video

13:17.230 --> 13:21.334
 full of blatant propaganda,
 I am now leaning
 toward Jessica Myrtle.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.436
Could you just please
lean to my first name?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.472
( bell rings )

13:26.539 --> 13:28.641
 Zack, I know
 you found out

13:28.675 --> 13:31.111
 about the Washington trip
 and that's why you're running.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.646
  - That's a nasty charge, sir.
  - Maybe it is,

13:33.680 --> 13:36.149
   but the only way you can
   prove that it isn't true,

13:36.182 --> 13:38.184
  is by staying
  in the race

13:38.218 --> 13:40.754
 now that the Washington trip's
 been canceled.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.088
   Canceled?

13:42.088 --> 13:46.359
 Oh,
 yeah, funding fell through.
 But we'll have loads of laughs

13:46.393 --> 13:48.661
 at those after-school
 and weekend meetings.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.697
We're going
to be buddies.

13:50.730 --> 13:54.167
Hey, Zack! The latest poll
has you 70%, Jessie 30.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.935
You can't lose!

13:55.969 --> 13:58.271
   Way to go, Zack.

13:58.304 --> 14:01.708
   Or should I say,
   President Morris?

14:04.644 --> 14:07.614
 I don't want to win,
 but I'm afraid I can't lose.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.283
 One thing's for sure--
 I can't quit.

14:12.218 --> 14:15.555
 But wait, there is someone who
 can beat me in this election.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.825
Who? Zack <i>moi.</i>

14:28.401 --> 14:31.971
   you have got
   to listen to me.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.974
   I am going to tell you
   this as gently as I can.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.977
   You're going
   down the toilet.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.846
  Am I really losing, Kelly?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.382
  You are flush city.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.185
  Zack's got the nerds,
  the geeks,

14:45.218 --> 14:47.721
the jocks
and the party animals.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.090
 That's what I call
 a Rainbow Coalition.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.726
 You can count on
 the Chess Club, the Latin Club

14:52.759 --> 14:55.762
   and the Future
   Orthodontists of America.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.697
This is terrible.
What am I going to do?

14:57.731 --> 14:59.099
   You've got to
   change your image.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.467
   Yeah, you've
   got to lighten up.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.303
 You know, be cool.
 Appeal to more of the people.

15:03.336 --> 15:07.073
 He's right. lf you don't
 change your image by
 tomorrow's debate

15:07.107 --> 15:09.909
 you're going to
 go down in history
 with George McGovern,

15:09.943 --> 15:13.680
  Walter Mondale
  and the Cleveland Indians.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.081
   All right, I'm desperate.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.317
  We've got 12 hours
  to turn my campaign around.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.119
  I will do anything.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.791
  Mr. Dewey: <i>Welcome to our</i>
 <i>presidential debate.</i>

15:24.824 --> 15:26.893
   Since Miss Spano is late

15:26.926 --> 15:30.263
it would not be a good idea
to start with her.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.732
   Mr. Morris,
   you may go first.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.768
  Thank you,
  Mr. Dewey.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.739
   I love this school.
   I love it so much

15:39.773 --> 15:42.342
  I propose extending
  the school day to 12 hours

15:42.375 --> 15:45.311
  and doing away
  with holidays and weekends.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.981
 And I want to keep the library
 open 'round the clock,

15:48.081 --> 15:50.750
   because I intend to ask
   the teachers to double--

15:50.784 --> 15:52.719
no,
make that triple the amount
of homework

15:52.752 --> 15:54.387
  we receive in each course.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.858
  And furthermore,
  I propose that we--

15:58.892 --> 16:00.927
 ( pop music playing )

16:05.498 --> 16:07.167
 Hit it, girl!

16:10.403 --> 16:12.439
 Now chill out,
 okay?

16:12.472 --> 16:15.208
 Like, I don't know what he
 said and, like, I don't care.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.410
 I just want to know, you know,
 are you guys in favor

16:17.444 --> 16:19.913
   of MTV during study hall?

16:19.946 --> 16:22.048
  All: Yeah!

16:22.048 --> 16:25.318
 Then, like, if I'm elected,
 we're not gonna study,
 we're gonna party!

16:25.352 --> 16:27.754
 ( cheering )

16:27.787 --> 16:29.756
 Vote for me, okay?
 'Cause then we'll take, like,

16:29.789 --> 16:31.891
   totally rad
   field trips to the mall.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.727
 ( cheering )

16:33.760 --> 16:35.128
  And when
  I'm elected, like,

16:35.161 --> 16:39.065
 there will be hall passes
 on demand, for sure.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.834
   For sure!

16:40.867 --> 16:42.869
   And now,
   the awesome one,

16:42.902 --> 16:46.072
 detention will be for teachers
 instead of students.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.345
( all chanting )
Jessie! Jessie!

16:56.082 --> 16:58.918
 Zack, you've got big trouble.
 According to my latest poll,

16:58.952 --> 17:01.021
 your lead's down
 to a couple of votes!

17:01.021 --> 17:02.889
 - Great!
 - Not great.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.492
Look at these demographics.
You're still
okay with the geeks,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.794
the party's over
with the party animals,

17:07.827 --> 17:09.863
 you've still got the nerds
 with glasses,

17:09.896 --> 17:12.065
  but the nerds without glasses
  can't see you at all.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.367
  And you're losing
  your jock support.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.304
  Screech,
  the trip to Washington
  has been canceled.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.339
 I want to lose.
 You going to help me?

17:21.340 --> 17:23.943
 Yeah, Zack,
 but it hurts.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.512
I was kind of hoping you'd
appoint me First Dweeb.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.082
Screech, you'll
always be First Dweeb.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.322
I just got
eight guys to switch
their votes to Jessie.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.857
  How'd you do that?

17:37.891 --> 17:40.060
 I promised to go to the movies
 with them.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.128
 How are you going
 to the movies with eight guys?

17:42.162 --> 17:44.564
 It's easy-- four on each side.
 Besides, they're cute.

17:44.597 --> 17:48.068
   I love politics.

17:48.101 --> 17:51.137
 That was some stunt you pulled
 during the debate.
 I'm impressed.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.541
   I'm not. I never thought
   I'd stoop so low to win.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.343
  Screech says
  the election's real close.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.079
 May come down
 to whose staff works harder.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.583
   Here's a quarter.
   Vote for Jessie.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.519
   Here's some quarters.
   Vote for Jessie.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.022
 Zack takes ballet lessons.
 Pass it on.

18:17.163 --> 18:19.232
 I knew Zack
 was pro-nerd.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.439
  I hope you
  weren't hurt by that
  smear campaign against you.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.874
   How'd you
   know about that?

18:27.907 --> 18:30.877
 There were rumors flying
 all around about you.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.146
You're not really
Belding's son are you?

18:33.179 --> 18:35.215
   Is that what they're
   saying about me?

18:35.648 --> 18:37.250
 Good.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.285
 Hey, you guys,
 you both did great. Good luck.

18:39.319 --> 18:42.055
 - Thank you, Kelly.
 - I wanted to
 vote for both of you,

18:42.055 --> 18:44.391
  - but I couldn't.
  - So who did you vote for?

18:44.424 --> 18:47.527
 I didn't think it was fair
 the way they were
 slandering Zack.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.163
 I know you're not going
 to like this, Jessie,

18:50.196 --> 18:53.166
 - but I voted for him.
 - You voted for Zack?

18:53.199 --> 18:55.068
How could you
do that to me?

18:55.068 --> 18:57.070
   How could you
   do that to me? I mean...

18:57.070 --> 18:59.072
How could you
do that to her?

18:59.105 --> 19:01.441
- I'm only one vote.
- I don't believe this!

19:01.474 --> 19:03.376
  Me neither.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.011
  For student body president,

19:05.045 --> 19:07.414
 these people got the following
 write-in votes:

19:07.447 --> 19:09.582
 Jason Bateman, nine;

19:10.650 --> 19:12.519
  ALF, seven;

19:14.020 --> 19:15.522
Gilligan, six;

19:15.555 --> 19:19.059
  And the Skipper, two.
  ( laughs )

19:21.695 --> 19:23.897
 Now for our
 two main candidates.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.633
  The tension mounts.
  Oh, what a feeling.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.836
 Jessie Spano,

19:29.869 --> 19:32.138
  342 votes.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.207
  ( cheers )

19:36.309 --> 19:37.777
Zack Morris...

19:37.811 --> 19:40.046
  343 votes.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.048
  ( cheers )

19:42.849 --> 19:44.551
  I demand a recount.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.286
 Jessie, I was
 only kidding.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.787
 I voted for Gilligan.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.294
  Congratulations, Zack. You've
  earned that
  trip to Washington.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.730
   Trip? But you said
   it was canceled.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.365
  That was just a test to see

19:58.398 --> 20:00.767
   if you care
   more about yourself
   than the school.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.268
But I was
wrong about you, Zack.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.604
You're a better man
than I thought.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.944
 ( knocking )

20:10.977 --> 20:13.613
 - Zack?
 - Hi. Can I come in?

20:13.646 --> 20:16.716
  You've been coming in
  that window for
  the past 10 years.

20:17.017 --> 20:18.885
Well...

20:18.918 --> 20:21.621
 actually, I came by
 to return something.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.922
 What?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.127
 Your blankie.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.864
I think I can get along
without it now.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.866
   So how you doing?

20:33.233 --> 20:35.201
 Fine.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.971
By the way, congratulations
on your victory.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.674
  Thanks.
  I'm sorry you lost.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.076
  It's okay.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.311
I'm really
happy for you.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.885
Jessie, you're crying.

20:51.918 --> 20:56.289
  I always cry when I'm happy.
  I sob at The Three Stooges.

20:56.322 --> 20:59.726
 Being elected president
 would've meant a lot to you,
 wouldn't it?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.795
Yeah...

21:03.329 --> 21:06.099
  but it's over now.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.235
  Oh, hey, I heard you won
  a trip to Washington, too.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.204
 I hope you enjoy it.

21:13.173 --> 21:15.975
Jessie, I have
to tell you something.

21:16.076 --> 21:17.377
  I knew about
  the trip all along.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.280
That's the only reason
why I ran against you.

21:20.313 --> 21:23.183
 What? You mean that's
 all you cared about?

21:23.216 --> 21:26.353
I also cared about getting
a week off from school.

21:28.321 --> 21:31.291
  Look,
  I really wanted that trip.

21:32.859 --> 21:36.096
   But I want your
   friendship more.

21:36.096 --> 21:38.098
  I'm going to Belding
  to resign.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.469
 Am I hearing what
 I think I'm hearing?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.170
 Yeah.

21:44.204 --> 21:46.773
 I want you to be president
 and go to Washington.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.842
That city needs
someone honest.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.178
 I'm sorry I hurt you.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.481
Now I feel bad.

21:55.448 --> 21:58.118
Well, here's someone
who might help.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.924
  Bear-bear!

22:06.092 --> 22:08.094
   I mean... Teddy.

22:10.864 --> 22:12.232
Still friends?

22:12.265 --> 22:14.100
   Forever.

22:26.279 --> 22:29.082
 ( instrumental music plays )
