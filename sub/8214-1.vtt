WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:06.529
OFFICER:
All right, we got
a hostage situation.

00:06.570 --> 00:08.663
The place is a private storage
facility for high-end art.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.338
We got three guys inside.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.201
We're looking at a minimum
of nine hostages.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.276
We believe one of the bad guys
is posing as a hostage.

00:14.310 --> 00:15.072
CARRIE:
Which one?

00:15.110 --> 00:17.544
You know, posing?
Indeterminate.

00:17.580 --> 00:18.808
"Indeterminate."
That's a, that's a tough word.

00:18.850 --> 00:19.817
What do you think, Al?

00:19.850 --> 00:22.114
I think we better make
some determinations soon

00:22.150 --> 00:23.708
or we could lose
a lot of people.

00:23.750 --> 00:24.717
Did you do
your homework?

00:24.750 --> 00:26.684
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.687
MAN:
Move, move, move!

00:27.720 --> 00:29.119
Get in there.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.622
Open that door.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.220
One here, one here!

00:46.840 --> 00:47.807
Down now!

00:47.840 --> 00:48.738
Get down!

01:03.490 --> 01:04.752
Down!

01:08.700 --> 01:10.827
You, back up!

01:10.870 --> 01:12.269
All the way back.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.367
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.368
I want everybody to stay down.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.242
All right.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.710
You're done. Drop the gun.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.445
Get up.

01:30.490 --> 01:31.809
Give me your hands.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.687
All clear.
All clear.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.756
Nice job, everybody. Good work.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.520
Whoo!
That was nice.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.859
AL:
Not bad. We beat our old record
by 25 seconds.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.390
What do we get,

01:45.430 --> 01:46.761
a gold star in our homework
books or something?

01:46.800 --> 01:48.461
Ah, you probably
filled yours up already.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.569
Okay, seriously,
though,

01:49.610 --> 01:51.703
don't you ever question
the value of these things?

01:51.740 --> 01:53.332
I mean, honestly,
when was the last time

01:53.380 --> 01:55.371
we had a hostage
standoff in Queens?

01:55.410 --> 01:57.708
AL:
What about the convenience
store, 3lst Ave?

01:57.750 --> 01:58.842
They're the ones.
CARRIE:
Yes.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.370
Right?
The old lady who
wouldn't leave

02:00.420 --> 02:02.638
until they fixed
the slushy machine.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.839
That's right.
Besides that.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.711
AL:
That was touch and go. Come on.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.751
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

02:30.410 --> 02:32.571
All right, let's just go
over it one more time.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.178
I told you, it
was a phone call.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.541
Guy calling himself Deputy
something-or-other says

02:36.590 --> 02:38.581
he wants to see us
at One City Towers.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.656
Please tell me you took care
of those parking tickets.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.624
I brought the receipts
right here just in case.

02:43.660 --> 02:44.854
Good.

02:44.890 --> 02:48.451
Wow, what kind of
cops live here?

02:48.500 --> 02:49.569
Not our kind of cops.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.502
_ MAN:
Lieutenant Burns.

02:58.540 --> 03:02.271
Eliot Delson,
Special Deputy to the Mayor.

03:02.310 --> 03:03.709
Nice to meet you.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.399
And you must be Carrie Wells.

03:05.450 --> 03:06.815
Yes, actually.

03:06.850 --> 03:08.738
You have questions.
Let me guess.

03:08.780 --> 03:09.712
You have answers.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.785
Nothing but.

03:10.820 --> 03:12.788
Ah.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.880
Welcome to the Major Crimes
Section of the NYPD.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.251
I've heard of it.

03:17.290 --> 03:18.552
You have?
You haven't?

03:18.590 --> 03:20.626
Not like I read Police
and Security News

03:20.660 --> 03:22.560
every morning
with my cornflakes.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.396
Maybe you should.

03:23.430 --> 03:25.660
You handle big stuff,
citywide stuff,

03:25.700 --> 03:26.860
extrajurisdictional.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.265
Exactly.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.768
How about something
I don't know?

03:30.810 --> 03:33.438
Have either of you ever heard
of Ari Sonnenland?

03:33.480 --> 03:35.778
I have.
He's a developer, a big one.

03:35.810 --> 03:37.698
Sunny Meadows Complex
in Elizabeth, New Jersey,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.411
the Sterling Tower
in the Navy Yards,

03:39.450 --> 03:40.712
and his brother is a beekeeper.

03:40.750 --> 03:43.548
I have no idea how I know that.
Yes, I do.

03:43.590 --> 03:48.414
Well, what you don't know is
that his daughter was kidnapped

03:48.460 --> 03:49.882
this morning in Central Park.

03:49.930 --> 03:53.559
We're not sure, but we believe
this might not be

03:53.600 --> 03:55.420
an isolated incident, but one
in a series of kidnappings

03:55.460 --> 03:57.325
targeting affluent families
on the East Coast.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.621
Central Park. Last I checked,

03:58.670 --> 04:00.661
we don't_ have one of those
In Queens.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.260
Look, it's pretty simple.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.039
The word's out on you guys.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.776
A 92% solve rate?

04:06.810 --> 04:08.368
You're the top
of the class.

04:08.410 --> 04:11.299
So that's why you were there
this morning.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.510
What was that, a final exam?

04:13.750 --> 04:15.012
Yes, I remember you.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.347
I liked the yellow tie better,

04:16.390 --> 04:17.345
by the way.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.914
Uh, I spilled tzatziki on it.

04:18.950 --> 04:22.056
There's a lesson in that:
never eat a gyro unwrapped.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.182
As for the exam,

04:23.230 --> 04:26.393
I'm pleased to report
you passed with flying colors.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.695
Thanks in part to that
astonishing memory of yours.

04:29.730 --> 04:30.697
What about our cases?

04:30.730 --> 04:32.027
Our real cases?

04:32.070 --> 04:34.595
_ Taken care_ of... _
while you're working With us.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.063
And this case
is very real.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.431
Lara Sonnenland is 11 years old.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.869
She's the starting sweeper
for the Darby Diggers.

04:41.910 --> 04:44.743
She has a cat named Maisie.
She needs your help.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.908
I promised you answers.

04:48.950 --> 04:51.316
Now, I, uh, I'm not sure

04:51.350 --> 04:54.012
what your setup is like
in Queens, but...

05:03.700 --> 05:05.429
I know guys who work
Major Crimes.

05:05.470 --> 05:06.698
They never described
anything like this.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.389
What'd you do,
raid a Best Buy?

05:08.440 --> 05:10.704
As I persuasively explained
to the mayor,

05:10.740 --> 05:13.334
after 9/11, the feds descended
on this city

05:13.380 --> 05:15.530
with all their fancy toys.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.775
CIA, Department of
Homeland Security,

05:17.810 --> 05:19.914
all here to take care of us.

05:19.950 --> 05:22.589
Well, it's time we took care
of New York ourselves

05:22.620 --> 05:25.384
like we used to.

05:25.420 --> 05:28.685
So, five months later,
a little more persuasion, and

05:28.720 --> 05:32.520
behold--
toys of our own and

05:32.560 --> 05:34.551
the authority to use 'em.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.795
Anything big goes down between
Fort Lee, Block Island,

05:36.830 --> 05:39.936
and Stamford, Connecticut,
it's mine.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.768
Ours. And, hey, now yours.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.835
Lara Sonnenland.

05:44.870 --> 05:47.873
Carrie, Al,
anything I can do for you,

05:47.910 --> 05:49.571
you know where
to find me.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.544
Delson.

05:52.950 --> 05:55.418
Idon't recall _
agreeing to all this.

05:55.450 --> 05:56.678
Oh, I do-- we didn't.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.381
Wouldn't matter.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.956
Eliot's not an asker,
he's a teller.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.049
In fact, he told me
to catch you guys up

06:02.090 --> 06:03.921
on the Sonnenland kidnapping.
How you doing? I'm Jay.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.552
In addition,
I'm gonna be your guide

06:05.590 --> 06:07.126
to the wonders
of the operations center.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.593
Just 'cause I'm Asian,
they assume

06:08.630 --> 06:09.858
I know all about computers
and stuff.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.492
Which you don't.

06:11.530 --> 06:12.667
No, actually I do.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.531
Worked for a while
for a little company

06:14.570 --> 06:15.730
in Redmond:
Internet security, scareware.

06:15.770 --> 06:18.933
ButI missed New York.

06:18.970 --> 06:22.098
Aanays, uh, this is
the crime scene.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.005
You can almost read
the license plate.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.745
Want to read the license plate?

06:25.780 --> 06:26.849
No, that's okay.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.609
Okay.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.584
So, Lara Sonnenland, on her way

06:30.620 --> 06:32.508
to a soccer game
on the Upper East Side.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.652
Kidnappers created
some kind of diversion

06:33.690 --> 06:35.555
to get the car
onto a service road.

06:35.590 --> 06:37.649
Bang-bang, they shoot
the driver, snatch the kid,

06:37.690 --> 06:40.158
and exit the park, we believe,

06:40.200 --> 06:43.522
_ on the north side _
in an as-yet-unknown vehicle.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.526
Driver's listed as critical
at Mount Sinai.

06:45.570 --> 06:46.764
What about security video
from inside the park?

06:46.800 --> 06:48.495
Al, we're looking,

06:48.540 --> 06:51.600
but there are a lot of ways to
blend in and hide, even from us.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.607
Eliot mentioned
other kidnappings.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.676
Two of them, actually.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.871
Brookline, Mass, 2011,
and Westport, Connecticut.

06:56.910 --> 06:58.707
That was just nine months ago.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.672
May I introduce
Cherie Rollins-Murray,

07:00.720 --> 07:02.938
the Cherie Rollins-Murray,
late of the FBI?

07:02.990 --> 07:05.083
Just Murray, please.
It's less of a workout.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.055
So, uh, Brookline, Westport.

07:08.090 --> 07:09.728
What makes you think
it's the same guys?

07:09.760 --> 07:11.921
East Coast targets,
same M.O.: time of day,

07:11.960 --> 07:13.825
street diversion.
You I.D. anyone?

07:13.860 --> 07:15.691
This is all we have.

07:15.730 --> 07:16.924
From the last one
in Westport.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.665
Birdwatcher
inadvertently shot

07:18.700 --> 07:21.589
what we eventually learned
was their hideout.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.607
The Westport case

07:22.640 --> 07:24.130
ended badly.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.707
The victim's family
relied on

07:26.740 --> 07:27.900
a professional hostage
negotiator,

07:29.710 --> 07:32.144
Said he could do a better
job than the Bureau.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.249
Imagine that.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.544
Huh. Well, he didn't.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.911
Something went wrong
at the money drop.

07:36.950 --> 07:39.919
The kidnappers panicked
and pulled out.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.655
But first they
killed the child.

07:41.690 --> 07:44.750
His name was Ethan.
He was nine years old.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.894
What went wrong?

07:46.930 --> 07:49.524
According to agents on the
scene, Paulson screwed up.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.219
AL:
You said they handled
it privately.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.897
Why were there agents
at the drop?

07:52.940 --> 07:53.964
Well, I wasn't there.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.537
But the Bureau handles
these things by the book.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.765
Well, maybe the book needs
to be rewritten.

07:58.810 --> 08:01.199
I got all the forensics from
Brookline and from Westport.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.969
Plus about a half a gig
of high-res photos

08:03.010 --> 08:04.238
from the Central Park
crime scene.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.010
I'll do a little 3-D stitch and
make you a virtual walk-through.

08:07.050 --> 08:10.213
I'd like to do
an actual walk-through.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.559
You know, like, in my body.

08:12.590 --> 08:14.717
Our CSU has been
all over that scene.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.526
Well, you know,
maybe they missed something.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.289
You know,
Frederick Law Olmsted

08:24.330 --> 08:26.127
actually designed
these hills and gullies

08:26.170 --> 08:29.708
to be out of sight
from the surrounding landscape.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.662
He probably didn't have
this in mind.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.132
Fan of the park, Jay?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.135
Fan of the city.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.829
Yeah, me, too.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.668
Pretty fancy school bus.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.554
AL:
What about the mother?

08:48.590 --> 08:49.625
Alison Sonnenland,
ne Schoenfeld.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.287
Former corporate attorney.
Lara's their only child.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.207
AL:
Yeah.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.732
Okay.

09:06.780 --> 09:10.648
The Sonnenlands
are ready to talk.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.942
AL:
We're not _
accusmg you, Sir.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.617
Well, I'd appreciate
you modulating your tone.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.789
My wife and I are
in no mood to be harassed.

09:20.820 --> 09:21.809
Mr. Sonnenland,

09:21.860 --> 09:22.758
the last thing
we want to do

09:22.790 --> 09:24.985
is make this any more
difficult for you.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.725
We're merely trying
to determine

09:26.760 --> 09:28.352
the identity of the people
who took your daughter.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.958
CARRIE:
So if there are any
business associates,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.662
rivals who might want
to hurt you...

09:32.700 --> 09:34.668
Of course there are people
that want to hurt me.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.769
My entire life is competition,
okay?

09:35.800 --> 09:38.769
I bid on projects. If I'm luclq,
I-I get them, I win.

09:38.810 --> 09:39.970
Which means someone else loses.

09:40.010 --> 09:43.377
Right.
Look, I understand how confusing

09:43.410 --> 09:46.299
and difficult this must be
for both of you.
I don't know why

09:46.350 --> 09:47.146
we're having this conversation!

09:47.180 --> 09:48.943
I have K&R insurance,
a lot of it.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.141
The company pays off,
we get Lara back.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.384
We don't care who took her.

09:52.420 --> 09:53.682
We just want her back.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.017
I promise you
we will do

09:55.060 --> 09:56.880
everything we can
to bring Lara home,

09:56.930 --> 09:59.023
but we have to
work together.

09:59.060 --> 10:01.255
Since they haven't contacted
you, we're at an advantage.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.621
We can set up a trap-and-trace
on your phone.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.695
Isn't that dangerous?
Wouldn't they know?

10:05.730 --> 10:07.869
No. They'll have no idea
we're listening in.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.162
Please let us help you.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.074
All right.
Whatever you say.

10:18.780 --> 10:19.872
Just get her back.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.338
He loves her very much.

10:26.390 --> 10:29.257
We didn't think
that we'd have children.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.827
I understand.

10:31.860 --> 10:34.749
Alison, do you think I could
take a look at Lara's bedroom?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.859
To get to know her
a little?

10:36.900 --> 10:38.822
It might help.

10:38.870 --> 10:40.838
Okay.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.904
It's so pretty.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.805
Yeah, she picked out
the pattern herself.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.899
I have no design
sense at all.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.872
Me either.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.046
That's recent.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.741
Those are her friends
from school.

10:55.780 --> 11:00.808
Oh. Well, that's quite
the collection.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.054
Oh, all the girls have those.

11:07.860 --> 11:08.952
You mind?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.093
No, of course not.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.943
*

11:46.200 --> 11:48.339
Alison, why didn't you tell me

11:48.370 --> 11:50.463
they'd contacted you?
What?

11:50.510 --> 11:53.809
The first thing they'd do
to let you know they had Lara

11:53.840 --> 11:55.273
would be to send you
something of hers.

11:55.310 --> 11:56.902
This was on her backpack.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.009
There's mud

11:59.050 --> 12:00.369
all over it.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.115
It won't be hard to prove
it's from the park.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.845
Don't make me waste
preCIous time.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.347
It's her favorite.

12:06.390 --> 12:09.882
That's why I-I put it back
on the shelf.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.955
She-She'll want it
when she comes home.

12:14.060 --> 12:18.895
They sent a package with a note.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.774
I told her.

12:28.810 --> 12:31.472
Alison, they said
they'd kill her.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.046
No, she's right.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.911
I trust her more
than I trust them.

12:36.950 --> 12:39.544
I hope to hell you're right.

12:39.590 --> 12:42.013
She is.

12:48.830 --> 12:49.922
Hey.

12:49.970 --> 12:50.959
All set.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.262
I don't trust the dad.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.291
That's okay;
he doesn't trust us.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.865
You okay with all this?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.935
I mean, of all cases, right?

13:00.980 --> 13:04.871
She's practically the same age
your sister, Rachel, was.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.002
What are the odds, right?

13:06.050 --> 13:08.268
I'm fine.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.811
I'll be more fine
when we bring Lara home,

13:10.850 --> 13:11.987
but I am, I'm ﬁne.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.885
All right.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.818
Here we go.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.172
Yes?

13:33.210 --> 13:34.302
MAN:
You received our little package?

13:34.340 --> 13:36.331
These guys know
what they're doing.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.268
Call is being matrix-routed
through multiple cell towers.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.949
Just like Westport.

13:40.980 --> 13:43.312
Yeah, but last time
we weren't listening.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.511
ARI:
Let me talk to Lara, please.

13:45.550 --> 13:46.915
Just let me talk to her.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.018
In good time.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.118
Again, know that you

13:49.160 --> 13:51.082
must not involve
Jay?
Getting close.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.529
the police in any way

13:52.560 --> 13:54.391
if you want to see
your daughter alive.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.352
We won't; I-I understand.
We won't.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.560
Say it again.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.295
Just a few more seconds.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.398
ARI:
I will not involve the police

14:01.440 --> 14:02.464
in any way.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.229
Good.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.135
Sometime between 2:00
Please put her on.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.205
and 3:00 this afternoon,

14:07.240 --> 14:08.571
you will receive another call
with our demands.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.311
And?

14:16.350 --> 14:18.318
We couldn't trace it.

14:18.350 --> 14:19.612
N0 I.D.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.288
You have nothing?

14:23.330 --> 14:25.423
We have his voice,

14:25.460 --> 14:29.021
and there's one man
who knows that voice.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.266
Jack Paulson.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.619
MAN:
That was
the Katherine Simpson case,

14:31.670 --> 14:33.262
out on the Island.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.494
Lovely girl.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.394
She went missing from a beach
in Sag Harbor.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.409
Albanians--
they're into everything.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.408
Wanted a billion dollars.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.429
Too many movies.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.175
I got 'em down
to a cool mil.

14:44.210 --> 14:47.316
Wowed 'em with my knowledge
of Tirana.

14:47.350 --> 14:48.612
Smart.
Well, I read travel books

14:48.650 --> 14:50.345
to put myself to sleep.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.142
I look at postcards.

14:52.190 --> 14:55.250
Um, Peptomol.

14:55.290 --> 14:56.382
I get this acid now.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.524
It's an unfortunate side effect

14:58.560 --> 15:01.290
of being permanently unemployed.

15:01.330 --> 15:03.264
Mr. Paulson, we understand
the insurance company

15:03.300 --> 15:06.019
you worked for let you go
after the Westport kidnapping?

15:06.070 --> 15:07.469
Four days I worked those guys.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.503
Finally set up a drop,
secure location,

15:10.540 --> 15:12.337
good access, piece of cake.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.002
The damn Bureau had
my phones monitored.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.600
They went in early
and they blew it up.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.538
This is a business built

15:20.580 --> 15:22.047
on reputation,

15:22.080 --> 15:24.082
and you guys destroyed mine.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.441
We weren't involved
in the Westport case.

15:26.490 --> 15:29.288
So, feds, state, local,
it's all the same.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.083
Your business is
catching bad guys.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.621
Mine is saving people
from bad guys.

15:33.660 --> 15:36.390
We're not the same, believe me.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.159
Why should I believe you?

15:38.200 --> 15:40.395
Because we're not afraid
to ask for your help.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.590
And you need my help why?

15:43.570 --> 15:45.401
MAN:
In good time.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.169
Again, know that you must not

15:47.210 --> 15:48.438
involve the police in any way

15:48.480 --> 15:50.505
if you want to see
your daughter alive.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.448
ARI:
I understand.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.142
MAN: _
Say it again.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.444
It's from
the Sonnenland kidnapping.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.983
Is that the man
you did business with

15:59.020 --> 16:00.112
in Westport?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.980
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's him.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.988
I'd never forget that voice.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.055
They're calling back within
the hour to arrange the drop.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.421
Can you be there?

16:07.460 --> 16:09.325
Jack, listen to me.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.191
The feds screwed up,
and a little boy died.

16:11.230 --> 16:14.097
With your help,
Lara doesn't have to.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.376
Yeah, Jay?

16:20.410 --> 16:21.570
Hey, they're calling again.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.009
It's them.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.268
Can you patch it through?

16:25.310 --> 16:27.540
Sure, just keep
your phone on mute.

16:27.580 --> 16:30.686
ARI:
Please don't hurt her.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.642
MAN:
You wanted to talk to her?

16:32.690 --> 16:35.784
You want to talk to your daddy?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.583
LARA: Daddy?
ARI: Lara?

16:37.630 --> 16:38.528
LARA:
Daddy, please.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.686
ARI:
Lara, honey.

16:39.730 --> 16:41.027
MAN:
That's enough.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.722
Listen very carefully.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.590
You will put $5 million in cash

16:45.630 --> 16:47.598
in a duffel bag
and place it on a chair

16:47.640 --> 16:50.234
beside the table near the
backpacks at Gansevoort Plaza

16:50.270 --> 16:52.409
at exactly 3:35 pm. tomorrow.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.204
After the bag is retrieved,

16:55.240 --> 16:57.572
an olive green gypsy cab
will pull up

16:57.610 --> 16:59.805
to the southeast corner
of Gansevoort and Greenwich,

16:59.850 --> 17:03.638
plate number T038191C.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.113
Your daughter will be
in that cab.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.482
Any attempts at interference
by the police,

17:08.520 --> 17:09.782
and she will die.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.629
Do you understand?

17:11.660 --> 17:13.150
ARI:
Yes, I understand.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.224
MAN:
Say good-bye, Lara.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.227
LARA:
Good-bye, Daddy.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.227
ARI:
Lara...

17:27.410 --> 17:28.604
CARRIE:
I'm saying we should hire him.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.675
Look, Paulson has gone up

17:29.710 --> 17:32.178
against these guys before;
he knows their moves.

17:32.210 --> 17:33.746
That gives him an expertise
that none of us have.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.509
A little boy died.
That is expertise

17:35.550 --> 17:37.381
I can do without.

17:37.420 --> 17:38.682
The feds were running a
three-ring circus in Westport.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.789
If they'd listened
to Paulson...

17:39.820 --> 17:41.549
He lost a child.

17:41.590 --> 17:44.229
There's a lot of baggage
that goes with that.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.252
You have an opinion on this
or are you just keeping score?

17:47.300 --> 17:50.599
There's no question Jack Paulson
was the best K&R guy out there,

17:50.630 --> 17:52.325
and I know he wants
these guys pretty bad.

17:52.370 --> 17:53.530
That is the last thing we need

17:53.570 --> 17:54.594
is a loose cannon
running around.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.595
Rolling around.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.608
Cannon.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.679
I have Carrie up by two.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.678
Yeah, fine.

18:02.710 --> 18:04.575
We'll run him as a consultant.

18:04.610 --> 18:05.645
Thank you.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.669
Now, what are you two

18:06.710 --> 18:08.211
actually doing?

18:08.250 --> 18:10.514
Besides hiring other people
to do your work for you?

18:10.550 --> 18:13.280
We were actually thinking
about hiring another person

18:13.320 --> 18:15.413
to do our work for us.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.519
You're not easy to like,
you know that?

18:17.560 --> 18:19.187
We just want to
get a fresh pair

18:19.230 --> 18:20.857
of eyes on the forensics
from the other kidnappings,

18:20.900 --> 18:22.891
and there's an M.E. we worked
with in Queens,

18:22.930 --> 18:24.625
Don't say Joanne Webster.
Joanne Webster.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.796
Great minds.

18:25.830 --> 18:26.865
Guys,

18:26.900 --> 18:29.630
she literally got herself
thrown off the island.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.661
She was expelled
as chief medical office...

18:34.740 --> 18:37.675
I wasn't expelled, Ellie,
I was promoted.

18:37.710 --> 18:38.904
Hello, Joanne.

18:38.950 --> 18:39.769
Joanne.

18:39.810 --> 18:42.779
You had a few
less formal names for me

18:42.820 --> 18:45.744
when you sold me out
to the city council.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.382
I didn't sell you out;
you did that yourself

18:47.420 --> 18:48.682
when you called the mayor
a corporate toady.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.756
It's just an opinion.
It was an opinion

18:50.790 --> 18:52.587
until you expressed it
to New York One,

18:52.630 --> 18:53.892
and then it became
a Post headline.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.727
AL:
So you guys know
each other.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.022
That's great.

18:57.060 --> 18:59.199
WEBSTER:
Yeah, I met Ellie when he
was working at City Hall.

18:59.230 --> 19:01.937
You had the dry cleaning
and lunch run.

19:01.970 --> 19:03.904
I was 23 years old.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.362
Well, you've certainly grown up.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.468
Well, one of us has.

19:06.510 --> 19:07.932
That's true.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.277
How's your prostate?

19:09.310 --> 19:11.540
Okay, why don't we get to work?

19:11.580 --> 19:14.549
Drop location is that table.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.775
First on the left
with no umbrella.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.879
In addition to cameras,
FBI will have spotters

19:18.920 --> 19:20.649
in adjoining buildings

19:20.690 --> 19:23.557
and in unmarked delivery trucks
parked adjacent.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.854
I'd nix the delivery trucks.

19:27.230 --> 19:28.424
Well, these guys do
their homework.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.722
Anything off schedule,
we're blown.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.296
Well, there won't be
any trucks there

19:31.330 --> 19:32.661
that aren't supposed
to be there.

19:32.700 --> 19:33.792
We do our homework, too.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.331
What's she doing?

19:37.870 --> 19:40.407
What she does.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.443
You never know what
will be important later.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.287
Your guys are gonna blow it

19:54.320 --> 19:55.651
just like in Westport.

19:55.690 --> 19:57.328
Come on, you don't know that.
Yes, I do.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.578
You want my advice?
Pay the money, be done with it.

19:59.630 --> 20:02.656
So, what, they can go
off, kidnap someone else?

20:02.700 --> 20:04.395
And why shouldn't they?

20:04.430 --> 20:05.727
We've guaranteed
their success.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.829
Now you sound
like one of them.

20:07.870 --> 20:09.861
I don't think you are.

20:20.780 --> 20:22.270
You were right
about the forensics

20:22.320 --> 20:23.446
of the previous kidnapping.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.787
Not so thorough, right?

20:24.820 --> 20:27.357
Well, that's being polite,
which I almost never am.

20:27.390 --> 20:31.383
Ethan Kandel, the boy
who died in Westport--

20:31.430 --> 20:33.295
the ME. up there indicated

20:33.330 --> 20:34.991
strychnine was the
cause of death,

20:35.030 --> 20:37.692
but generally, when there's
a kidnapping of minors,

20:37.730 --> 20:40.290
you find tranquilizers.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.433
So I took another look
at the chem analysis.

20:42.470 --> 20:45.337
Well, see for yourself.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.530
Looks like a poodle.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.472
Oh, it is a poodle. Sorry.

20:49.510 --> 20:50.738
My niece's birthday.

20:50.780 --> 20:53.317
That is an alkaloid molecule

20:53.350 --> 20:56.717
almost identical to strychnine,
curare.

20:56.750 --> 20:57.910
Curare?

20:57.950 --> 20:59.838
As in poisoned arrows
and blow darts?

20:59.890 --> 21:02.484
Curare in small doses

21:02.520 --> 21:04.556
can be a very powerful sedative.

21:04.590 --> 21:07.650
It's quite popular
amongst the criminal class

21:07.700 --> 21:09.429
in certain Amazonian countries.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.325
Nice work, Jo.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.468
So, what in God's name are you
and Al doing with Eliot Delson?

21:16.500 --> 21:17.899
I don't know.

21:17.940 --> 21:19.601
He called.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.301
It's mostly Al; it's not me.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.637
Bright lights, big city.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.908
You know?
I was gonna say,

21:23.950 --> 21:25.042
"Been there, done that,"

21:25.080 --> 21:26.604
but this is quite a setup.

21:26.650 --> 21:27.719
Yeah.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.310
What is your take on Eliot?

21:30.350 --> 21:31.578
Oh, Eliot's okay,

21:31.620 --> 21:33.759
as long as you realize
it's never about you.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.314
He has his sights set

21:35.360 --> 21:36.679
way down the road,

21:36.720 --> 21:37.948
and Major Crimes, you, me,

21:37.990 --> 21:40.026
we're just stepping stones.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.049
To what?

21:41.100 --> 21:42.328
Brighter light, bigger city.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.497
I don't think Eliot knows.

21:43.530 --> 21:44.929
You ever miss it?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.961
The bright lights?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.399
Oh, sure.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.536
But bright lights tend
to cast long shadows.

21:52.570 --> 21:54.401
Yeah.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.772
Thank you, sensei.

21:56.810 --> 21:59.643
Wax on, wax off.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.011
See you later.

22:01.050 --> 22:04.588
Bye.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.962
Now, I heard a rumor
that you may have linked

22:18.000 --> 22:19.467
our bad guys to South America?

22:19.500 --> 22:20.432
Possibly.

22:20.470 --> 22:22.597
Like possibly maybe
Colombia, South America?

22:22.640 --> 22:23.629
Possibly possibly.

22:23.670 --> 22:24.762
What do you got?

22:24.810 --> 22:25.902
Good morning, by the way.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.066
Good morning.
Okay.

22:27.110 --> 22:29.476
So, uh, I checked all the
electronic surveillance reports

22:29.510 --> 22:31.102
from the Westport kidnapping.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.845
A lot of back and forth
by our bad guys

22:32.880 --> 22:34.973
but all on untraceable
burner cells.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.976
We got a program that can
ID. the actual phones.

22:37.020 --> 22:39.011
And it seems a bunch
of 'em were purchased

22:39.050 --> 22:41.484
three months before the
kidnapping in a place called

22:41.520 --> 22:43.556
Leticia, Colombia.

22:43.590 --> 22:45.126
Wow. I'm impressed.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.151
Thank you.
I'd be really impressed

22:47.190 --> 22:49.499
if you were tracking the rest of
the phones from that same lot.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.997
Well, you said
they bought a bunch.

22:51.030 --> 22:52.099
Right?

22:52.130 --> 22:53.631
Maybe they held on to a few.

22:53.670 --> 22:55.035
Good idea.

22:55.070 --> 22:57.061
I have 'em occasionally.
Hey, listen,

22:57.100 --> 22:58.965
um, uh, I just want to say,

22:59.010 --> 23:01.877
you know, now that, you know,
we've worked together for a day,

23:01.910 --> 23:04.708
I think it's really freaking
cool, your whole memory thing.

23:04.750 --> 23:05.944
Aw.
Yeah, I read about it.

23:05.980 --> 23:07.049
Yeah? Thanks.
So...

23:07.080 --> 23:09.571
You mind if I...?

23:09.620 --> 23:11.838
Oh, fine, go ahead. Okay, yeah.
Okay, how about, uh,

23:11.890 --> 23:14.688
I don't know,
August 23, 1999?

23:14.720 --> 23:15.914
August 23, 1999.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.109
It was a Monday.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.549
Sunrise was at 6:19 am.

23:19.590 --> 23:21.751
The first case
of West Nile Virus was reported

23:21.800 --> 23:22.892
in New York City.

23:22.930 --> 23:24.420
I had lunch at Buster's.

23:24.470 --> 23:27.064
Turkey club and French fries--
it was good.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.159
And the Yankees beat
the Rangers 21 to 3.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.701
Ouch... oh!

23:30.740 --> 23:33.061
And it was Eve's birthday.

23:33.110 --> 23:35.203
My sister?
How'd you know that?

23:35.240 --> 23:37.470
It's on your desk.

23:37.510 --> 23:39.501
Oh, yeah, yeah,
oh, right.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.541
No, I always forget.
I never do.

23:41.580 --> 23:44.014
I just got word--
we're on for the drop.

24:03.140 --> 24:05.165
Dad's on the move.

24:15.550 --> 24:16.744
Dad's in place.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.486
AL: _
Copy. We see it.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.909
Everyone hold.

24:26.030 --> 24:28.225
3:35-- prize is in place.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.750
Both teams hold
until prize is acquired.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.100
How long does this take?

24:40.140 --> 24:41.778
Not long.

24:41.810 --> 24:42.879
When they go,

24:42.910 --> 24:46.573
we move on the bag
and your daughter.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.077
JAY:
Hold on. Possible incoming.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.179
Green gypsy cab
heading north on Greenwich.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.288
MURRAY:
It's too early.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.129
They said that they were
gonna grab the bag first.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.650
Hold for verification
on the cab.

24:59.690 --> 25:00.725
Anyone got eyes?

25:00.760 --> 25:04.218
AGENT:
Got the plates-- T038191C.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.295
What the hell's it doing here?

25:06.330 --> 25:08.537
Hold on.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.559
Okay, people, this is it.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.907
Ready to go.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.241
MURRAY:
Drop location is that table.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.180
First on the left
with no umbrella.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.814
On my count.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.815
In five...

25:28.860 --> 25:31.181
Al, that guy was there yesterday
with his family.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.084
He's not part of this.
...four, three...

25:33.130 --> 25:34.597
Al, I'm telling you,

25:34.630 --> 25:36.257
he's not our guy.
Hold. Repeat all hold.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.165
Holding.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.667
Honey, would you go pay
for this?

25:42.840 --> 25:44.660
Lady's good.

25:51.210 --> 25:52.802
3:40-- five minutes
since the drop.

25:52.850 --> 25:54.909
They wouldn't wait this long.
He's right.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.212
Something's wrong.
Okay, close it out.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.911
Go.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.611
All go.
All go, go!

26:05.060 --> 26:07.119
AL:
Get out of the car!

26:08.160 --> 26:10.048
Get out!

26:10.100 --> 26:11.328
Pop the trunk.

26:11.370 --> 26:12.860
OFFICER:
Right here, right here.

26:12.900 --> 26:13.889
DRIVER:
What'd I do?

26:15.100 --> 26:18.308
AL: We don't have the girl.
Repeat, we don't have Lara.

26:19.810 --> 26:21.004
But I didn't do anything.
Spread your legs.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.234
I just drove over here.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.872
(continues
indistinctly)

26:23.910 --> 26:26.105
What'd I do?

26:27.110 --> 26:29.146
MAN:
We said no cops.

26:29.180 --> 26:31.740
You screw with us again,

26:31.790 --> 26:33.781
the girl dies.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.059
Nothing on the cab driver.

26:52.110 --> 26:55.034
Guy was hired from a pay
phone, stolen credit card.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.638
Big surprise.

26:56.680 --> 26:57.999
How about you?

26:58.050 --> 26:59.403
It's just, I...

26:59.450 --> 27:01.816
I'm trying to find
something, anything.

27:01.850 --> 27:03.169
Background noises, a train.
I got nothing.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.812
We'll catch a break.

27:04.850 --> 27:05.987
How's this?

27:06.020 --> 27:07.089
Something on the dad.
Friend of mine

27:07.120 --> 27:08.985
at Justice told me on the QT,

27:09.020 --> 27:10.749
Sonnenland's company,
Meridian, has been

27:10.790 --> 27:12.189
under investigation for months.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.256
Seems he overextended himself
after the crash of '07,

27:15.300 --> 27:17.427
ended up leveraged
to the hilt.

27:17.460 --> 27:18.791
He's broke.

27:18.830 --> 27:19.797
Six months ago

27:19.830 --> 27:22.333
he pulled out
of a project

27:22.370 --> 27:23.860
he was putting
together in Moscow.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.366
A state-of-the-art mall

27:25.410 --> 27:27.230
called Cosmos Park.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.272
I know that.

27:34.450 --> 27:37.317
Alison, they said
they'd kill her.

27:37.350 --> 27:39.887
There was a working model
of it on his desk.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.219
Well, if Sonnenland is getting
back into Cosmos Park,

27:43.260 --> 27:44.750
he's got to be getting
the cash from somewhere.

27:44.790 --> 27:47.725
$5 million in K&R money
would be a good start.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.318
ARI: _
What are you suggesting?

27:49.360 --> 27:51.225
Can you explain
how you're suddenly

27:51.270 --> 27:53.329
back in play with Cosmos Park?

27:53.370 --> 27:55.099
Well, that's none
of your business.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.334
We, and the Justice
Department by the way,

27:56.370 --> 27:58.304
are curious to know how you
got the funds to move forward.

27:58.340 --> 27:59.898
You have over
$5 million

27:59.940 --> 28:02.272
in K&R insurance--
isn't that right?

28:02.310 --> 28:05.370
So you've come up here
to accuse me

28:05.410 --> 28:07.401
of kidnapping my own daughter?

28:07.450 --> 28:10.248
Mr. Sonnenland, it's not
gonna be hard to track

28:10.280 --> 28:12.009
your e-mails and phone records.

28:12.050 --> 28:13.244
Now, if there's
a legitimate explanation,

28:13.290 --> 28:14.416
we're happy to hear it.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.852
You want to know
how I got back into Cosmos?

28:17.890 --> 28:19.255
I am getting a loan.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.292
On the side

28:21.330 --> 28:23.195
from some people I met

28:23.230 --> 28:24.458
in Moscow.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.128
I assume you have
a record of this?

28:27.170 --> 28:28.194
Yes, I have a record of it.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.332
And phone numbers and addresses.

28:30.540 --> 28:32.405
and get the hell out of my life?

28:32.440 --> 28:34.408
I'm calling Len Foster
in the mayor's office.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.771
You people are useless.

28:35.810 --> 28:39.302
You can expect to hear
from my lawyer.

28:39.350 --> 28:42.342
Can't wait.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.416
Maybe his Russian loan sharks
grabbed Lara.

28:44.450 --> 28:46.384
Murray's trying
to verify the transaction.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.512
I don't know. Maybe.

28:47.550 --> 28:50.314
Either way, you know his next
call's not to his lawyer.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.452
He's gonna have his buddy
at City Hall

28:51.490 --> 28:53.355
put us on the first boat
to Queens.

28:53.390 --> 28:56.427
Hey, maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.769
Carrie, are you not

28:58.800 --> 29:01.189
seeing the opportunity here?

29:01.240 --> 29:04.038
Look. Look around, all right?

29:04.070 --> 29:05.537
It's the big time.

29:05.570 --> 29:07.367
If we deliver here,

29:07.410 --> 29:09.298
you see the kinds
of cases they handle,

29:09.340 --> 29:10.170
the resources...

29:10.210 --> 29:13.304
I don't care about
the big time, Al.

29:13.350 --> 29:15.511
I don't care about
their resources.

29:15.550 --> 29:18.383
I have all the resources
I need right here.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.411
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.257
I, uh...

29:24.290 --> 29:26.520
This case...

29:26.560 --> 29:29.495
Yeah.

29:29.530 --> 29:32.363
Of all cases, right?

29:32.400 --> 29:34.334
I had finally decided

29:34.370 --> 29:36.838
to make my peace with the fact

29:36.870 --> 29:39.031
that I might never know

29:39.070 --> 29:40.799
who murdered my sister.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.398
It's been 28 years.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.249
I told myself it's time
to put it to bed.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.406
Give it a rest.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.169
But now we're here
with this case

29:48.220 --> 29:50.313
with little Lara.

29:51.450 --> 29:54.351
Al, I'm afraid...

29:54.390 --> 29:56.381
to let my sister go.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.355
How could you think...?

29:59.390 --> 30:01.995
You of all people?

30:03.460 --> 30:06.020
You could never let her go.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.260
Let's bring Lara home.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.437
Hey, um...
What?

30:14.480 --> 30:17.608
Just so you know, I already
think you're the big time.

30:17.640 --> 30:18.846
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.074
Ambitious Al?

30:20.110 --> 30:20.872
I...

30:20.920 --> 30:22.615
like Ambitious Al.

30:24.050 --> 30:25.984
Well, that would be a first.
JAY: It worked.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.885
Your idea about the cell phones,
it worked.

30:27.920 --> 30:28.989
I ran the numbers

30:29.020 --> 30:30.556
of the entire shipment
of phones

30:30.590 --> 30:33.127
against cell calls made
in the New York City metro area

30:33.160 --> 30:34.354
around the time of the
Sonnenland kidnapping.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.594
And check this.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.518
Several of the phones
were used in Brooklyn

30:37.560 --> 30:38.492
a week before the kidnapping.

30:38.530 --> 30:40.395
And they stopped suddenly,
but there they were.

30:40.430 --> 30:41.169
Where's there?

30:41.200 --> 30:41.564
Triangulating off
of cell towers,

30:41.600 --> 30:42.396
I got it down

30:42.440 --> 30:44.465
to a 150-foot radius
in Sunset Park.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.398
I think we got 'em.
Tell Eliot we're on our way.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.931
And tell Paulson
to meet us there.

31:01.090 --> 31:04.526
Go, go, go.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.959
Go left.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.491
Clear.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.931
Clear.

31:22.610 --> 31:23.599
CARRIE:
Al!

31:23.640 --> 31:25.198
I got a body in here.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.205
MAN:
Got a body.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.241
I got two more.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.080
Who do we have here?

31:33.120 --> 31:35.111
Can you unzip
those bags, please?

31:36.160 --> 31:38.321
Don't worry.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.679
They don't mind.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.220
MAN:
All right,
you heard her.

31:41.260 --> 31:44.229
What appears to be
an entrance wound

31:44.270 --> 31:45.498
in the frontal bone

31:45.530 --> 31:49.489
directly above the left
suborbital process.

31:49.540 --> 31:52.008
Massive discoloration
of the flesh-- wow.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.268
Wait a second.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.947
MURRAY:
Birdwatcher inadvertently shot

31:58.980 --> 32:02.438
what we eventually learned
was their hideout.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.414
The Westport case...

32:06.390 --> 32:07.482
Oh, my God.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.957
These are
the Westport kidnappers.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.389
How do you know?

32:12.430 --> 32:13.579
I recognize the tattoo.

32:13.630 --> 32:15.052
Jo, how long has
this guy been dead?

32:15.100 --> 32:17.694
Oh, at least five
days, maybe a week.

32:17.730 --> 32:19.960
If we haven't been dealing
with these guys,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.139
who have we been
dealing with?

32:22.170 --> 32:23.330
Someone who's gone
to an awful lot of trouble

32:23.370 --> 32:25.361
to make us think that we have.

32:25.410 --> 32:28.208
Is that the man you did
business with in Westport?

32:28.240 --> 32:30.379
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's him.

32:30.410 --> 32:32.549
I know that voice anywhere.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.979
You want my advice?

32:34.020 --> 32:35.476
Pay the money
and be done with it.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.709
Jack Paulson.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.091
Okay, thanks.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.666
Murray's over
at Paulson's office.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.224
He's gone. No sign of Lara.

32:53.270 --> 32:55.397
You think he was in this
from the beginning?

32:55.440 --> 32:57.032
I don't know how I missed it.

32:57.070 --> 32:58.207
It's the perfect plan:
two birds with one stone.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.208
Paulson takes out
the Westport kidnappers

33:00.240 --> 33:02.174
and collects $5 million
from Sonnenland.

33:02.210 --> 33:04.269
Three birds.
He also gets back at the cops

33:04.310 --> 33:06.141
who ruined his career.
The thing is,

33:08.420 --> 33:10.570
So, bye-bye, Jack.

33:10.620 --> 33:11.644
Yeah, Jay, what's up?

33:11.690 --> 33:12.782
Okay, the girl's father's

33:12.820 --> 33:15.357
on the move. He left his house
around 45 minutes ago.

33:15.390 --> 33:17.688
Took his car over to a car wash
on 10th Ave.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.256
All right, thanks.
Wait a second.

33:19.290 --> 33:21.121
What's the name of the car wash?

33:21.160 --> 33:23.993
Uh, place called Easy Clean--
Tenth Ave and 24th.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.666
He's dropping the ransom money.

33:33.710 --> 33:35.701
Paulson's back on plan.
Listen to me.

33:35.740 --> 33:38.208
When we brought him in--
when I brought him in--

33:38.250 --> 33:41.413
all _he had to do was make sure
things went south at the drop.

33:41.450 --> 33:42.474
Then he goes to Sonnenland,

33:42.520 --> 33:45.239
convinces him to let him make
the drop himself.

33:51.290 --> 33:54.157
Okay, thanks. Bye.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.395
According to the manager,
Sonnenland came in an hour ago,

33:56.430 --> 33:58.523
got a basic wash,
then left a bag off,

33:58.570 --> 34:01.164
gave the guy a 20
to hold it for Jack Paulson.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.792
Paulson called
ten minutes ago,

34:02.840 --> 34:06.162
said he's on his way
to get it.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.063
On his way out
of the country.

34:07.110 --> 34:08.077
Jay's been on Paulson's
credit cards,

34:08.110 --> 34:10.237
said he just purchased
a ticket to Honduras.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.406
What happens
to the girl?

34:12.810 --> 34:14.778
Why don't we ask him?

34:19.350 --> 34:22.057
CARRIE:
Paulson.

34:33.730 --> 34:35.493
Own_er's worried
about his lost busmess.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.167
Yeah, well, tell
him we're cops.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.701
We'll buy a lot
of air fresheners.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.367
He's not talking.

34:47.410 --> 34:50.277
MAN:
Any attempts at interference
by the police,

34:50.320 --> 34:52.311
and she will die.

34:52.350 --> 34:53.817
He'll talk to me.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.548
Let's go.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.555
Where's Lara?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.625
I told you, I want a lawyer.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.763
You don't deserve a lavwer.
Where's Lara?

35:07.800 --> 35:09.734
I have no idea.

35:09.770 --> 35:11.431
Why were you headed to JFK?

35:11.470 --> 35:12.437
Who says I was?

35:12.470 --> 35:14.370
The ticket in
your pocket.

35:14.410 --> 35:17.902
You found out we were on to you,
you panicked, and you ran.

35:17.940 --> 35:21.273
Where's Lara?!

35:21.320 --> 35:23.538
Jack, your guys?

35:23.580 --> 35:25.286
They know we brought you in.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.548
When you don't show,

35:26.590 --> 35:28.251
they're going to assume
you gave them up

35:28.290 --> 35:31.384
and they are going to kill
that little girl!

35:33.660 --> 35:35.218
So that's it?

35:35.260 --> 35:37.649
You're just gonna let her die?

35:41.700 --> 35:45.534
I saw your face
when you heard her voice.

35:45.570 --> 35:47.367
You bought that?
Yes.

35:47.410 --> 35:49.298
No, I figured I'd go along
for the ride,

35:49.340 --> 35:51.240
maybe put a couple bucks
in my pocket,

35:51.280 --> 35:52.645
get back in the game.

35:52.680 --> 35:53.874
Oh, so it's
just business?

35:53.910 --> 35:58.313
If it was just business, why
do you have a signed David Ortiz

35:58.350 --> 36:00.181
ball on your desk
that once belonged

36:00.220 --> 36:03.314
to a poor, murdered
little boy?

36:04.630 --> 36:05.824
Those bodies we found--

36:05.860 --> 36:08.499
the real Westport kidnappers--
that was you.

36:08.530 --> 36:12.318
You wanted justice for
Ethan Kandel's murder...

36:12.370 --> 36:14.736
because that is your business,
that's what you do.

36:14.770 --> 36:19.264
You save people
from the bad guys.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.709
Only this time,

36:20.740 --> 36:23.777
you are the bad guy.

36:23.810 --> 36:26.199
Jack".

36:26.250 --> 36:30.516
I know you never intended
for Lara to get hurt.

36:30.550 --> 36:33.485
How are you going to live
with yourself if she dies?

36:36.260 --> 36:37.352
It's too late.

36:37.390 --> 36:38.379
It's never too late.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.682
I was supposed to be there
a half an hour ago.

36:40.730 --> 36:41.958
She may be dead already.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.458
If there's even the slightest
chance that she's still alive,

36:45.500 --> 36:46.899
we have to help her.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.462
Jack, please.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.645
I could use some Peptomol.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.817
Buy you a case when we're done.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.410
Something tells me
I won't need it then.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.429
Hey, Wells,
this make me a good guy again?

37:12.460 --> 37:14.496
Maybe so.

37:14.530 --> 37:16.521
Fair enough.

37:21.470 --> 37:22.539
Where's Dubio?

37:25.040 --> 37:27.964
He went to get the car.
Where the hell were you?

37:28.010 --> 37:30.035
Oh, it was that damn E train.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.674
First, it's late,
then they pull it from service.

37:32.710 --> 37:34.644
Swear to God, I thought
I was gonna kill somebody.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.648
Yeah, you're 47 minutes late.
They make you swim?

37:36.680 --> 37:40.844
Oh, come on now.
You know I can walk on water.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.653
Count that. It's all there.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.699
Hey, sweetheart,
we are going home.

37:49.730 --> 37:51.288
He's with her. Yes!

37:51.330 --> 37:52.490
All units stand by.

37:52.530 --> 37:53.519
Okay.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.759
What are you doing?

37:58.810 --> 38:00.937
We're done here.
I'm taking her out.

38:00.970 --> 38:02.699
That's not what we said, Jack.

38:02.740 --> 38:05.402
We go together in the car.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.010
Well, sometimes
plans change, Don.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.678
Look, I promised the father,
okay? You can hold on

38:10.720 --> 38:12.517
to my share
if you want.

38:12.550 --> 38:13.517
For an hour.

38:13.550 --> 38:15.450
Don't forget
I know where you live.

38:15.490 --> 38:16.479
I said leave her alone, Jack.

38:17.690 --> 38:18.657
What's the matter with you?

38:18.690 --> 38:20.521
I just made you a rich man.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.549
Something's not right.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.624
Give me the girl.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.524
They're not buying it.
We got to move.

38:26.570 --> 38:27.662
All units move in. Go! Go!

38:27.700 --> 38:30.567
What is the big deal? I told you
I'll meet you in Jersey.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.568
I said bring the girl over
here. Come here, sweetheart.

38:32.610 --> 38:33.565
Where's my dad?

38:33.610 --> 38:34.634
It's okay.
Don!

38:34.680 --> 38:36.477
Bring her over here!

38:36.840 --> 38:38.000
Run!

38:46.720 --> 38:48.517
CARRIE:
Lara?

38:49.660 --> 38:52.549
Hey! Come here, sweetie.

38:52.590 --> 38:53.420
Hi.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.427
Come here.

38:54.460 --> 38:55.620
OFFICER:
Clear?

38:55.660 --> 38:56.888
OFFICER 2:
Affirmative.
She's secure.

38:56.930 --> 38:59.023
Hold on. They're coming.
They're coming.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.994
You're okay now,
sweetie, all right?

39:02.040 --> 39:03.530
Okay.

39:04.510 --> 39:05.636
(officer speaks
indistinctly)

39:07.810 --> 39:09.607
Jack.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.608
Jack, she's gonna be okay.

39:28.630 --> 39:30.621
There they are.

39:30.660 --> 39:31.627
Go, go.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.558
LARA:
Daddy.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.632
Thank you both.

39:40.870 --> 39:41.905
Hey.
Hmm?

39:41.940 --> 39:42.929
You did that.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.869
Oh. No,

39:45.910 --> 39:49.016
we did that.

39:49.050 --> 39:51.780
ELIOT:
There you are.

39:51.820 --> 39:53.412
Great job today.

39:53.450 --> 39:55.156
In fact, the mayor just called

39:55.190 --> 39:56.555
with a similar
observation.

39:56.590 --> 39:57.579
How nice of him.

39:57.620 --> 39:59.622
I hope
you're gonna stick around.

39:59.660 --> 40:01.719
Thanks, but we
really got to get back.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.523
Okay, about that.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.028
I-I do have something
I'd like to show you.

40:15.710 --> 40:16.870
What do you think?

40:19.150 --> 40:20.606
Too close?

40:20.650 --> 40:22.618
I could move them apart
a little.

40:22.650 --> 40:23.639
Although,
from what I understand,

40:23.680 --> 40:25.580
you two are used
to close quarters.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.588
Wow.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.656
You're quite amazing,
you know that?

40:29.690 --> 40:30.987
What-What was all this,
another test?

40:31.020 --> 40:33.454
Save the little girl,
get the fancy new job?

40:33.490 --> 40:35.629
Hardly. I put your transfers
through two days ago.

40:35.660 --> 40:37.628
You can't do that. Can he?

40:37.660 --> 40:39.594
Look,

40:39.630 --> 40:43.088
I'm hiring you to work
on the highest profile crimes

40:43.140 --> 40:44.937
in the greatest city on Earth.

40:44.970 --> 40:46.608
And we report to you?

40:46.640 --> 40:49.507
Only to me and hardly even that.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.098
I'm mostly here
to cover your backs.

40:51.140 --> 40:52.869
While we cover
your ass?

40:52.910 --> 40:56.573
Just so you know,
about 17 people

40:56.620 --> 40:58.713
way up the food chain

40:58.750 --> 41:01.514
all called and demanded
I back you off Ari Sonnenland.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.709
Did I?

41:04.890 --> 41:06.755
So just take the damn job.

41:06.790 --> 41:08.792
Besides, those two

41:08.830 --> 41:10.149
like working with you.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.519
And that is a first.

41:13.570 --> 41:15.060
What about Webster?

41:15.100 --> 41:16.089
Really?

41:17.270 --> 41:20.865
Fine, but if she calls me
Ellie again,

41:20.910 --> 41:23.003
I'm-I'm gonna ship her off
to Ronkonkoma...

41:23.040 --> 41:25.076
wherever the
hell that is.

41:26.580 --> 41:27.877
Look, I know I've been acting

41:27.910 --> 41:29.878
like this is some kind
of dream job,

41:29.920 --> 41:31.615
but if it's not your dream...

41:33.690 --> 41:35.612
I can't believe_
I'm gonna say this,

41:35.660 --> 41:38.151
but... I want to stay.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.127
You do?

41:40.160 --> 41:41.752
Mm-hmm.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.756
Listen, when you dragged me
back into all

41:43.800 --> 41:45.563
of this in Queens,

41:45.600 --> 41:48.694
you told me I was ready
to be a cop again.

41:48.740 --> 41:52.267
I hadn't seen you in nine years.
I would have said anything.

41:53.770 --> 41:55.203
You were right.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.175
I am ready.

41:58.210 --> 42:00.303
Lara showed me that.
I didn't become a cop

42:00.350 --> 42:01.248
just to solve
my sister's murder.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.874
I became a cop
because she was murdered.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.639
I wanted to keep people
from suffering like I did.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.988
And Rachel?

42:10.290 --> 42:13.828
Well, you were right
about that, too.

42:13.860 --> 42:15.794
I got her.

42:15.830 --> 42:19.596
Wow, I can't remember
when I've been so right.

42:19.630 --> 42:21.791
I can't remember either.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.769
Hmm...

42:29.740 --> 42:31.742
Well, what do we got here?

42:39.290 --> 42:40.609
Coming?

42:52.300 --> 42:53.028
Nice chair.
