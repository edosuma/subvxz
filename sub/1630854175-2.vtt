And it'll work better

Garza's wings

and bring his unit under

03:18.131 --> 03:19.900

becomes a demotion,

03:47.060 --> 03:48.529
Been there. I'll make sure
it looks good as new.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.197
Alright, thank you.
I owe you.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.765
Oh, I know.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.405
What's wrong?

03:57.438 --> 04:00.741
I think I just sold
a piece of my soul to Elena.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.276
What happened
with your agent?

04:02.310 --> 04:04.278
Did you tell them you couldn't
do the table read thing?

04:04.312 --> 04:06.046
No, not yet.
Why?

04:06.079 --> 04:09.216
Acting in a Santiago film is--
it's like a dream for me.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.385
Right?
And this is hard.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.454
I-I feel like I just traded in
being an actor playing a vampire

04:13.487 --> 04:15.456
for one playing a Fed,
with a lot less money.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.957
You're spinning out.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.327
Right?
So, think about this.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.495
We just got here,
and we already helped close

04:21.529 --> 04:24.231
two high-profile cases.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.667
I mean, I get having doubts.
It's natural.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.269
But you gotta commit,
even if you don't feel it yet.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.472
Look, my mama used to
say two things,

04:31.505 --> 04:34.908
and one of them was
"Fake it till you make it."

04:34.942 --> 04:35.976
What was the other one?

04:36.009 --> 04:37.978
"Beauty is painful."

04:38.011 --> 04:42.149
Well, you look so good,
it's hurting me, baby.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.284
There it is!
That's what I'm talking about.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.120
Look, B,
take a big swing today.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.789
Get some skin in the game.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.858
Own this job.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.793
Good morning, trainees.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.195
Briefing time.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.164
Uh, I'll meet you in there. Okay.

04:57.197 --> 05:00.267
Are you crazy?
You have a heart condition.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.802
Hey, hey, you're supposed
to keep that on the low.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.040
You do know
I'm your boss, right?

05:07.074 --> 05:10.043
Three second rule.

05:10.077 --> 05:13.046
Get-- Okay. See, now,
that's-- that's just mean.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.048
I'm trying
to save your life.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.717
And I'm not gonna keep
your little secret

05:16.750 --> 05:18.118
unless you start
eating better.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.488
Fine.
Now get to work.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.659
What are you doing?
Uh, me? Nothing. Nothing.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.829
It's just, uh...

05:28.862 --> 05:31.565
These are your coloring books,

05:31.599 --> 05:34.334
officially known as a
Probationary New Agent Handbook.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.136
All the mandatory tasks

05:36.169 --> 05:38.406
rookies must complete
during their probation.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.307
If you can't complete
all tasks

05:40.340 --> 05:42.175
within the
probationary period,

05:42.209 --> 05:43.911
good luck
in your next career.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.813
Alright.
Analyze evidence.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.180
Participate
in surveillance.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.882
Make seven arrests.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.584
Okay,
what's the first task?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.753
There's no particular order.
Which one's the hardest?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.187
Big swing, remember?

05:54.221 --> 05:56.657
Cooperating Witness Development
and Operation

05:56.690 --> 05:57.891
is no easy feat.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.593
Getting ourselves a snitch.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.495
No. No, no, no.
Human intelligence source.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.663
Now, there are three reasons

06:02.696 --> 06:04.565
a person agrees
to be an informant.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.400
One, they need to get themselves
out of trouble.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.936
Two, they want revenge.
And three, love of country.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.037
Piece of cake. I'm in.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.572
Me, too.
Slow down.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.942
Working informants requires
gathering human intel.

06:14.975 --> 06:18.412
And homo sapiens
are notoriously unreliable.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.280
It's too risky
this early in your training.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.583
And if you fail,
we'll get dinged.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.586
Or you get rewarded when we
succeed, which is what we do.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.721
Ha!
Talk your talk, B.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.023
Alright.
Well, C.I.s it is.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.892
Alright, well, I already
have someone in mind,

06:31.925 --> 06:33.527
so I'll drive.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.162
Ha! That's my boy.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.699
Heard you busted
a pill dealer this morning.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.267
You heard right.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.369
Making arrests
before I even get to work.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.237
Really impressed with yourself.
Mm-hmm.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.907
Do you think you can get him
to inform on his pill supplier?

06:46.940 --> 06:49.242
Easy.
I can charm anyone.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.278
You don't flip informants
with charm.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.813
You lay out the facts
of the case against them,

06:52.846 --> 06:54.648
and you lean into the prison
time they're facing

06:54.682 --> 06:55.883
if they don't cooperate.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.486
Emotional appeal
plus being this cute

06:58.519 --> 07:00.954
will beat facts every time.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.322
20 bucks
says you can't do it.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.325
Is betting an approved
FBI training technique?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.827
Are you too scared
to bet on yourself?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.395
Hell no.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.330
Game on.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.501
I put your guy
in interrogation.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.336
Well, did he make
any statements?

07:16.369 --> 07:20.774
No, but sometimes my aura
intimidates people into silence.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.913
See? It's a curse.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.314
He's all yours.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.182
Rules.
You can't offer him a deal.

07:29.216 --> 07:32.285
You must convince him to become
an informant for a federal crime

07:32.319 --> 07:34.622
using only your
so-called charms.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.758
You got something to write with?
You gonna want to take notes.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.327
Class is in session.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.996
Hey.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.332
Aw, Anton.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.000
Come on.
Don't be like that.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.636
You hit me
with your car.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.538
It barely
put a scratch on you.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.507
Probably 'cause
you got all these muscles.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.308
I got a little daily
workout regimen.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.811
I bet you're getting
so much exercise

07:57.845 --> 07:59.112
working your
maintenance job

07:59.146 --> 08:01.649
over there at Angelvale
Medical Building.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.617
Oh, you know it.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.385
Is that where
you get your pills from?

08:05.418 --> 08:07.487
You got the hook up?

08:07.521 --> 08:08.989
Yeah, I just snag them
from the pharmacy, you know?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.558
Mm-hmm.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.726
Some informant you got here.
He just snitched on himself

08:12.760 --> 08:14.528
for a crime that's not federal.
You lose.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.630
Hey, bro, you see I'm vibing
with the lady, right?

08:16.664 --> 08:18.899
Yeah, bro. We vibing.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.868
He a hater.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.303
Look, and had the nerve
to say on the way over here

08:23.336 --> 08:25.238
that you wasn't deep enough
in the game

08:25.272 --> 08:26.907
to know about
any other major crimes.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.643
Please, I know about all types
of criminal activity.

08:29.677 --> 08:33.046
In fact, there's some shady
stuff going down at my job.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.815
Shady like what?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.216
So, check this out.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.685
All the floors
are being rented out

08:37.718 --> 08:39.519
by different medical offices.
Mm-hmm.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.922
Except the first.
It's vacant.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.391
But I saw equipment
being delivered.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.694
Folks coming in and out
at all hours of the day.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.496
What are you suggesting? Some
kind of illegal medical practice

08:49.529 --> 08:50.831
or insurance fraud?

08:50.864 --> 08:53.400
Or it could be
experiments on aliens.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.737
Feel me?
Well, okay.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.873
But we investigate
all federal crimes.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.510
Th-The ones about aliens,
that's a different unit.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.412
Anton, would you be willing
to scope it out for us?

09:05.445 --> 09:07.681
Wear a wire?
Please?

09:07.715 --> 09:10.350
Sure, but she
gotta put it on me.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.924
Alright, Hollywood.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.459
Who is this possible informant
of yours?

09:19.492 --> 09:20.961
His name is Joshua Mackey.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.263
He's a bellhop
at the Seabury Hotel.

09:23.296 --> 09:26.399
And you wouldn't believe
what kind of stuff transpires
behind hotel room doors.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.369
Endangered animal trade,
illegal gambling.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.538
Seabury-- isn't that where
the cast of "Vampire Cop"

09:31.571 --> 09:32.572
used to party?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.141
How do you know that?

09:34.174 --> 09:36.276
Well--
Maybe did a little research?

09:36.309 --> 09:37.911
Maybe worked up
a little profile?

09:37.945 --> 09:40.080
Well, I can't train someone
if I don't know who they are.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.915
Alright.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.550
Hit me.
What's your profile?

09:43.583 --> 09:47.287
Well, as an actor, you played
hyper-masculine hero roles,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.589
which suggests
you're drawn subconsciously

09:49.623 --> 09:53.593
to characters who embody traits
you're probably lacking.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.428
Wow.
Don't take it personally.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.765
I-I-I don't.
The "wow" is just to indicate

09:57.798 --> 10:01.168
how... wrong
your profile is.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.803
Just so you know,
most actors,

10:02.836 --> 10:04.772
we don't get to choose
our roles.

10:04.805 --> 10:08.141
The first job I got, I was cast
as a hunky guy with dimples.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.843
After that,
I got typecast.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.111
But nice try, though.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.246
Profiling is part science,
part art.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.183
And I'm just beginning
to paint your picture.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.520
Tío, what do you want for lunch?

10:20.553 --> 10:24.257
I'll take a double bacon chee--
salad.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.460
Get me
a kale and beet salad.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.996
Is this a joke?

10:29.029 --> 10:31.198
The only vegetable I've ever
seen you eat is ketchup.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.666
Just bring me
the damn salad.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.601
Okay.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.503
Hey, uh, Simone's C.I.
might've led us to something.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.338
Not sure it's going to be
special unit worthy yet,

10:38.371 --> 10:39.773
but we are putting
a wire on a guy.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.008
Have Laura and Brendon
back you up.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.310
You make sure you give LAPD
a courtesy heads-up.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.377
Great.
I'll put a case number on it.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.478
No. Not yet.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.980
Only if it
leads to an arrest.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.515
We're under the looking glass
right now, Carter.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.483
I only want wins.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.385
It's proper procedure
to generate case numbers

10:52.419 --> 10:54.121
on active operations.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.355
Matt, if the SAC
finds out--

10:55.388 --> 10:57.624
She won't. Trust me.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.892
She won't.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.368
J.J.!

11:08.401 --> 11:09.903
B-man the G-man!

11:09.937 --> 11:11.138
What's up?
Hey, what's up?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.539
You good?
I'm great.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.707
So, tell me something.

11:13.741 --> 11:17.044
How much... illegal stuff
do you see here?

11:17.077 --> 11:19.212
Mucho.
Mucho? And how much

11:19.246 --> 11:22.682
would you like to help me catch
some big-time criminals?

11:22.716 --> 11:24.417
Also mucho.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.653
Great. We are interested
in you keeping us informed

11:26.686 --> 11:29.857
of any crimes you see that might
be of interest to the FBI.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.592
Help us keep
this great nation safe.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.061
Do it for America.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.262
I'm Canadian.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.830
Yeah, then do it
for the cash.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.732
Now you're talking.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.901
Good to see you, okay? And--
Okay. We are leaving now.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.203
Simone and Carter
need our help with a sting.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.172
Okay, I'll give you--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll call you.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.439
Talk to you soon, bro.
See you, man.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.474
There.

11:49.576 --> 11:52.545
Now we'll be able to see and
hear everything you're doing.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.047
This is some crazy
spy stuff.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.949
Remember, the owner
might be in on it,

11:55.983 --> 11:57.017
so watch yourself.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.385
We just need you
to get in there,

11:58.418 --> 12:00.387
walk around
so we can see what's what.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.190
If you see anything or anyone
that seems dangerous,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.758
walk away.
It's okay.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.026
Nah, nah,
I-I can't do this.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.395
Wait, wait, wait. Anton.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.197
We're homies, remember?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.565
Our vibing is over.
I'm out.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.602
Anton, if you bail, you go
to prison for the next decade.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.772
But if you get us some intel,
you get to go home.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.573
Okay.
Smart man.

12:22.009 --> 12:25.012
See, it's always best
to deal with the facts.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.381
Next round's a tie breaker.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.050
Carter said LAPD
will meet us here.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.054
Sergeant Bradford?
I'm Special Agent Laura Stensen.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.755
This is my probie,
Agent Acres.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.591
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.828
This is Officer Chen.
Want to walk me through your op?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.598
"Probie."
I hate that word.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.968
Yeah. LAPD trainees
are called "Boots."

12:48.001 --> 12:49.669
You know, anything
to put us in our place.

12:49.702 --> 12:50.804
So you're not a--
A rookie?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.272
Uh, no, not anymore.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.341
But, you know,
the scars run deep.

12:55.876 --> 12:56.910
I'm Lucy.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.411
Oh. Nice to meet you.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.779
I'm, uh--
Brendon.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.148
Yeah, no, I know.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.917
I binged every season
of "Vampire Cop"

13:03.951 --> 13:06.019
while I was reeling
from a bad breakup.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.620
"Crime sucks."
Yep.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.857
Yep. So did my ex.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.627
Oh, God. Would-- Would you
take a selfie with me?

13:14.661 --> 13:16.463
Absolutely. Yeah.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.630
Really?
Sure.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.299
Oh.
Long as you send me a copy.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.834
Okay.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.804
Oh, there you go.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.406
I'm so embarrassed.
So embarrassed.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.810
Friendly is on-site,
about to enter the building.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.285
<i>I'm slowly walking inside now.</i>

13:38.318 --> 13:39.452
It's quiet, y'all.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.553
<i>And dark as hell.</i>

13:40.587 --> 13:42.155
Why is he narrating?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.159
Help you?

13:46.193 --> 13:48.862
<i>Yeah, I got a report
for a water leak.</i>

13:48.896 --> 13:49.997
<i>Who were you
just talking to?</i>

13:50.030 --> 13:51.331
<i>No one, man.</i>

13:51.364 --> 13:52.632
<i>No leak here.</i>

13:52.665 --> 13:53.901
It's my job, man.
See, it's my job--

13:53.934 --> 13:54.701
I said take a walk.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.569
Anton, get outta there.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.505
<i>I gotta get in there.
I gotta fix--</i>

13:58.538 --> 14:01.008
Our friendly is compromised.
Commence extraction.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.747
Police! Back up.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.886
You okay?
They knocked some teeth loose.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.222
<i>I'll call an ambulance.
Can we leave them here?</i>

14:15.255 --> 14:17.657
Yeah.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.426
FBI.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.761
This is
a sterilized O.R. Get out.

14:21.794 --> 14:25.832
Y'all are doing off-the-books
plastic surgery in here, huh?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.234
This is your patient?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.401
That's Victor Quincannon.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.503
He's number nine
on the FBI's Most Wanted.

14:30.537 --> 14:34.007
We caught one of the world's
most wanted criminals

14:40.347 --> 14:40.880
Victor Quincannon.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.750
This is a huge arrest for us.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.618
He runs one of the most violent
weapons-dealing operations

14:45.652 --> 14:47.220
in the world.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.423
Last reported sighting was
in Luxembourg four years ago.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.525
The Bureau, Interpol, MI6,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.527
everyone with a badge has been
on the hunt for this guy.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.596
Facing that kind of heat,
it makes sense

14:56.629 --> 14:58.932
that he would go under the knife
to change his appearance.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.233
Has he woke up
from the anesthetic?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.035
Not yet. He was transferred
to Shaw Memorial.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.570
But LAPD has him secured.

15:03.603 --> 15:04.938
Statements from
the surgical team?

15:04.972 --> 15:06.773
All lawyered up.
But given who their patient is,

15:06.806 --> 15:08.208
that's no surprise.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.442
Nice work, Simone.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.810
Thank you, sir.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.279
How's your C.I. doing?

15:12.312 --> 15:14.147
He's a little shaken up,
but he'll be fine.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.782
He'll be more than fine
once he gets that reward money

15:15.815 --> 15:17.317
for finding Quincannon.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.386
Except the guy you found
isn't Quincannon.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.222
Your suspect's prints
belong to a Walter Krebs,

15:22.255 --> 15:24.091
L.A. local
and former postal worker.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.258
No record
of criminal history.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.994
The hell's a mailman doing

15:27.027 --> 15:29.596
at a black market
plastic surgery center?

15:29.629 --> 15:31.098
I've heard about super fans
going under the knife

15:31.131 --> 15:32.899
to look like
their favorite celebs,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.968
but why would somebody want
to stan for a wanted fugitive?

15:35.002 --> 15:37.404
Makes no sense.
Someone getting paid to do it.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.638
It's not a crazy idea

15:38.671 --> 15:40.807
that a guy like Quincannon
would want a body double.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.010
Carter, Simone, I want you there
when this guy wakes up.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.477
If Laura's right,
he may just have a lead

15:44.511 --> 15:46.113
on the real
Quincannon's whereabouts.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.680
Hey, it's Josh at the Seabury.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.316
He said he's got
something juicy for us.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.418
Well, it's going to be tough
to beat Simone's catch.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.153
Why you gotta
harsh my mellow?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.991
I don't know what that means.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.427
I'm gonna go eat my bacon
cheeseburger with onion rings.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.195
Your kale and beet salad
is on your desk.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.463
Unless you want to trade?

16:03.496 --> 16:06.066
Trade? No way.
Beets are the new beef.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.838
That's him.
That's who?

16:11.871 --> 16:13.473
That's Congressman Burton.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.276
Yup.
My man comes here often.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.547
Checks in under different names,
different women every time.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.117
Now, I'm no FBI agent, but
I know a John when I see one.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.053
Okay. Thank you.
We've got it from here.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.289
Get it.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.558
Ooh. That's--
That's big, right?

16:31.591 --> 16:33.360
No, not really.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.695
Prostitution's a crime,
but it's not federal business.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.964
Until someone tries
to blackmail the congressman,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.199
and that's
public corruption. Oh.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.500
That is a federal crime.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.535
And who investigates that?
Us.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.471
Even with your tortured logic,
I mean,

16:44.504 --> 16:46.639
it would take more than
an intimate conversation

16:46.673 --> 16:49.842
to prove soliciting
a sex worker.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.011
<i>You got it, girl ♪</i>

16:52.045 --> 16:53.913

Hi. Uh, Brendon's C.I.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.420
got us onto something delicate,
a congressman and a sex worker.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.322
No, no, no, no, no.
This unit cannot afford

17:02.355 --> 17:05.058
a political minefield right now.
You document what you saw

17:05.092 --> 17:06.993
and you pass it on
to the Public Integrity Unit.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.162

Miss. Excuse me, miss.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.039
Hi.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.841
Agent Acres, FBI.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.943
I'm very sympathetic

17:23.976 --> 17:26.546
to the challenges of a woman
in your... position,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.281
but sex work is a crime.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.417
I'm sorry, sex work?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.119
Yeah. We saw you
with the congressman.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.353
But the good news is,
if you agree to--

17:33.386 --> 17:36.623
The congressman
is my husband.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.125
But we got information

17:38.158 --> 17:41.461
that the congressman meets
many women here at the hotel.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.201
And those women
are all me.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.702
Not that
it's any of your business,

17:49.736 --> 17:51.271
but we role play.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.541
And the envelope
that he gave you?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.209
We're seeing
"Lucia di Lammermoor"

17:56.243 --> 17:57.810
at the Dorothy Chandler tonight.

17:57.844 --> 18:01.714
So, if there's anything else, Agent...

18:01.748 --> 18:04.584
Acres, is it?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.589
We might have a...

18:09.622 --> 18:11.391
bit of a problem.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.660
How the hell did you get
mixed up in all of this?

18:13.693 --> 18:15.295
I went through
a vicious divorce,

18:15.328 --> 18:17.497
and I wanted
to start dating again.

18:17.530 --> 18:21.168
So I posted some thirst-trap
photos on Cliptalk.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.303
And, uh, out of the blue,

18:23.336 --> 18:26.973
I get DM'd
by this anonymous account

18:27.006 --> 18:29.342
talking about
a "opportunity."

18:29.376 --> 18:31.077
What kind of opportunity?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.779
The kind that pays
a million bucks

18:32.812 --> 18:35.482
to be a body double
for a prominent man.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.617
Anyway, if-- if I wanted
the part,

18:37.650 --> 18:40.353
I had to get
these surgeries

18:40.387 --> 18:42.289
to make my face
identical to his.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.191
And that was appealing
to you?

18:44.224 --> 18:46.626
Yeah. My life sucks.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.429
I'm broke. I'm in debt.
I've got no prospects.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.633
Then $250,000 gets wired
directly into my bank account.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.935
And you have no idea
who this prominent man was?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.870
No, and to be honest with you,
for that kind of money,

18:57.904 --> 18:59.539
I didn't care.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.874
They said I was gonna be
living in a mansion.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.511
I was gonna be
taking meetings as the guy.

19:04.544 --> 19:08.047
I was gonna be driving
his luxury cars. Sold.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.616
The man's name
is Victor Quincannon.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.285
He's a violent criminal
on the FBI's Most Wanted List.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.720
Oh, that's not good.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.154
No kidding.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.389
Did you ever meet with him?

19:16.423 --> 19:18.658
Uh, no. I was supposed
to report for training

19:18.691 --> 19:20.627
after my six surgeries,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.729
you know, to learn
his mannerisms and stuff.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.297
You got an address?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.233
No, I still have
three more surgeries.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.035
Uh, probably not gonna
get those now, huh?

19:29.068 --> 19:30.337
Unh-unh.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.706
Agent Acres!

19:33.740 --> 19:35.242
Do you know what's worse
than getting a call

19:35.275 --> 19:38.378
from a furious congressman?
Getting a call from his wife.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.079
You know, I didn't get divorced
three times

19:40.112 --> 19:42.415
only to have another man's wife
rip me a new one!

19:42.449 --> 19:43.716
Matt.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.652
I specifically said
not to engage.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.820
Now the congressman's wife
is mortified

19:47.854 --> 19:49.889
that the whole city is gonna
know about their kinky sex life,

19:49.922 --> 19:51.491
and somehow it's my fault.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.059
I'm really sorry, sir.
It's on me, boss.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.394
I shouldn't have taken
my eyes off of him.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.695
It's clear
that you do not know

19:55.728 --> 19:58.365
how to work an informant,
so just stop trying.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.500
They traced Krebs' wire payment
to an offshore account,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.201
one that happens to pay
a mortgage

20:02.235 --> 20:04.170
for a mansion in Laguna.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.006
Which is most likely where the
real Quincannon is living now.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.277
Finally, some good news.
Everybody, tac up.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.111
We are going to end this day
on a high note.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.967
<i>Stay vigilant.</i>

20:35.001 --> 20:37.236
Remember, this guy
could be packing.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.572
FBI! Freeze!

20:41.841 --> 20:44.344
Oh, he <i>is</i> packing.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.079
I'm assuming you don't
have a gun in there,

20:47.113 --> 20:48.448
but show us
your hands anyway.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.553
Uh...

20:53.586 --> 20:55.221
I'm-- I'm not--
I'm-- I'm not me.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.923
I mean-- I mean, I-I am me.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.492
I'm just not... him--

20:59.526 --> 21:01.227
the person you think I am, Quincannon.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.964
Uh, I am a completely
different guy.

21:04.997 --> 21:08.901
And I can-- I can prove it.

21:08.935 --> 21:12.138
Plastic surgery scars?
Are you for real right now?

21:12.171 --> 21:14.507
Another damn body double?

21:14.541 --> 21:16.843
Fingerprints confirm
his identity as Logan Hess.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.679
This is what he looked like
before all the plastic surgery.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.450
And to think, if I didn't use
my charm on Anton,

21:23.483 --> 21:25.084
we wouldn't have found Krebs,

21:25.117 --> 21:26.919
and this guy wouldn't be
sitting here now.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.955
Back up. I had the idea
of flipping Anton

21:28.988 --> 21:30.323
in the first place.
Regardless--

21:30.357 --> 21:32.124
this is the final round
of charm versus fact.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.594
Whoever gets him to flip wins.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.632
Oh, my God. Uh, Quincannon
hired me three years ago

21:39.666 --> 21:42.301
to do his meetings and his deals
because he was paranoid

21:42.335 --> 21:44.103
that he was going to get
captured or killed.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.638
I was really in there
for a while

21:45.672 --> 21:47.106
because he paid
a lot of money.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.041
But, you know, looking
over your shoulder 24/7

21:49.075 --> 21:50.677
gets a little bit exhausting.

21:50.710 --> 21:54.514
So I secretly hired Walter Krebs
to be my body double

21:54.547 --> 21:56.315
and take my place.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.984
Where's Quincannon...

21:58.017 --> 21:59.151
now?

21:59.185 --> 22:00.353
No, no, no.

22:00.387 --> 22:03.456
I-I want a deal first.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.392
Answers will come later.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.794
It's a draw.
Damn it!

22:07.827 --> 22:09.996
N-Not you, honey.
You're on the come up.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.398
Go get your deal.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.465
Man!

22:22.509 --> 22:24.143
How are you doing?
Fine.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.913
Everything's fine.
No. No, it's not.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.348
You were desperate
for a win today.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.918
Which caused you to push
way too hard at the hotel.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.888
I know this because I, um,
reworked your profile.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.825
Okay.

22:38.858 --> 22:39.926
Lay it on me.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.495
Okay.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.863
You mentioned
you were typecast,

22:43.896 --> 22:46.165
but that's not
entirely true.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.435
Plenty of actors
reinvent their image.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.836
You just never did.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.270
And maybe that's because

22:51.303 --> 22:53.440
you have an unquenchable desire
to be wanted.

22:53.473 --> 22:57.109
You live for praise.
You-- You feed on it.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.711
Yet you've chosen
to work at a place

22:58.745 --> 23:01.180
where we're known more for
our failures than our successes.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.115
So you're going
to have to decide

23:03.149 --> 23:04.884
if that's something
you can deal with.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.887
If it isn't,
you'll quit.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.089
Or I'll have to fire you.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.391
And then you'll be a cautionary
tale to future rookies--

23:12.425 --> 23:15.428
the TV actor
who couldn't hack it.

23:15.462 --> 23:16.429
Ouch.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.564
Mm.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.397
That's rough.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.232
Yes.

23:20.266 --> 23:22.435
It is.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.970
But it's the truth.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.138
Yeah.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.578
Good night.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.815
Hey.
Hey.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.484
What was that all about?

23:37.517 --> 23:39.385
Of all the roles
I've ever played,

23:39.418 --> 23:40.953
being in the FBI
is the only role

23:40.987 --> 23:42.789
I can't seem
to get a handle on.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.757
What?
B, talk to me.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.292
Hey.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.260
Sorry, the motor pool couldn't
get to your Caddy today.

23:48.294 --> 23:50.129
Too swamped.
But definitely tomorrow.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.465
I know you lying.
Tomorrow. I got you.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.936
My daddy's gonna kill me.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.015
Mr. Santiago.

24:09.048 --> 24:12.018
Brendon, I am thrilled
you reconsidered.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.987
I was going to read your part.
And, uh, no one wants that.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.322
Thank you for having me.

24:16.355 --> 24:18.791
It's an honor
just to be considered.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.426
I've been a fan of yours
since "The Unturned Stone."

24:20.459 --> 24:21.928
Ah.
Hey.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.429
Hi.
Ah, yes, this is Ross.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.698
I've been trying to make
"Water is Thicker Than Blood"

24:25.732 --> 24:27.266
for like 10 years.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.537
And, uh, he is
the genius producer

24:30.570 --> 24:32.872
who found the money to do it.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.642
I cannot wait to see what you
bring to the role, Brendon.

24:35.675 --> 24:36.976
Everyone ready?
Ah, yes.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.815
Hey.
Hey.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.383
Got those clothes
that you asked for.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.018
Oh, I-I thought you weren't
coming till tomorrow.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.720
I-I would have
cleaned the place up.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.624
When you said
you found a cheap place,

24:51.658 --> 24:53.159
you weren't kidding.
Yeah, well, I'm hoping

24:53.192 --> 24:54.727
I won't be here
for much longer.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.495
Wanna sit?
I have news.

24:56.529 --> 24:58.565
I can't stay.
I gotta pick up Isaiah, so...

24:58.598 --> 25:02.301
I'm up for an A-SAC position
in the New Orleans office.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.670
It's the dream job.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.004
Carter--
Evelyn, I know--

25:05.037 --> 25:07.206
I know we're on the edge,

25:07.239 --> 25:08.741
but this could
fix everything.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.543
You have been up
for promotions before.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.844
How is this any different?

25:11.878 --> 25:13.746
This one's a lock.
How?

25:13.780 --> 25:16.215
Who's hooking you up?

25:16.248 --> 25:17.717
Tracy.
The snake?

25:17.750 --> 25:20.352
Carter, what have you
gotten yourself into?

25:20.386 --> 25:22.922
You know, I never cared
about the promotions.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.891
Or how many hours
you worked.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.726
I just wanted you
to be happy.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.728
And you weren't.
You aren't.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.197
I can be. Please.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.566
Let me do this--
for us.

25:36.569 --> 25:39.739
Heaven was in the endless nights
at our lake house,

25:39.772 --> 25:42.408
drinking bad red wine,

25:42.441 --> 25:46.112
watching the musculature of
the waves beat against the dock.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.115
But that paradise fell
years ago.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.550
We can go back.

25:51.584 --> 25:52.852
Ritche, wait.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.622
A gunshot rings out.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.624
And then we...

25:57.657 --> 26:00.793
fade to black.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.864
Alright! Wow. Wow.
Yeah!

26:04.897 --> 26:06.699
You were amazing.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.635
Aww, I appreciate that.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.202
When I heard
you were reading the part,

26:10.236 --> 26:13.405
I was like,
"Wow, tragic miscast."

26:13.439 --> 26:15.608
Oh.
But, no, you were so good.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.376
Thank you.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.145
Oh, I'm supposed to
leave my script, aren't I?

26:19.178 --> 26:20.212
I think so.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.114
Ah. Well, it was nice
to meet you.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.315
You, too. Good night.
Really good job. Yeah.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.550
Bye.
Bye-bye.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.152
Tell our friend in Serbia

26:26.185 --> 26:28.855
there's literally zero risks.

26:30.757 --> 26:31.958
He gives us the cash,

26:31.991 --> 26:33.826
we filter it through
the production company,

26:33.860 --> 26:35.728
and then he gets paid back
as an investor,

26:35.762 --> 26:37.096
and the money is clean.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.898
But 30% kicks back to me.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.733
And since I value
his business so much,

26:40.767 --> 26:44.270
tell him I'll give him
an associate producer credit.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.642
Hey, Daddy.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.410
Don't you
"Hey, Daddy" me.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.279
You think you're so slick.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.514
I can explain.
Oh, you'd better,

26:55.547 --> 26:58.517
because I didn't know
what to say to Anton's father.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.921
He claims that Anton's working
for you and the FBI.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.423
What the fresh hell is--
I can't discuss it.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.591
You made him an informant.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.659
I didn't say that.

27:06.693 --> 27:07.860
You're not denying it.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.428
Because I can't discuss it.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.598
It's confidential.
A-A-A-And you said

27:12.631 --> 27:14.033
you didn't want to talk
about my work at home.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.334
You breaking your rule.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.804
His father said
he almost got killed.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.873
Is that your way of "changing
the FBI on the inside"?

27:20.907 --> 27:23.442
By convincing our people
to risk their lives

27:23.475 --> 27:24.944
by snitching on each other?

27:24.977 --> 27:27.680
You got your way of helping
the community, and I got mine.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.381
Anton committed a crime.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.050
What, I'm-- I'm supposed
to let him slide

27:31.083 --> 27:33.152
because his family
is good people?

27:33.185 --> 27:34.854
Systemic disenfranchisement
is--

27:34.887 --> 27:36.989
Is real. I know.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.391
But believe it or not,
what I may or may not be doing

27:39.425 --> 27:41.193
for Anton
is meant to help him.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.195
You're delusional.
You're judgmental.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.965
They're brainwashing you.
I can think for myself, Daddy,

27:45.998 --> 27:47.834
and I know
exactly what I'm doing.

27:47.867 --> 27:52.038
And that's exactly why
I'm so disappointed in you.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.472
Wha--
Ah.

28:00.780 --> 28:01.613
♪ Hello, world,
let me introduce myself ♪

28:03.049 --> 28:04.683
So it's like,
no matter what I say,

28:04.717 --> 28:07.553
if I don't agree with him,
my dad just shuts me down.

28:07.586 --> 28:08.888
I'm sorry. That sucks.

28:08.921 --> 28:09.922
Thanks.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.158
But your turn.
Spill it.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.425
Spill what?

28:13.459 --> 28:16.763
Mm. Whatever ridiculous thing
you did last night.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.364
I saw that look
on your face.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.266
It's the same looks
my students had

28:20.299 --> 28:21.433
before they did
something stupid.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.869
It wasn't stupid.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.037
I went to that Dylan Santiago
table read last night.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.173
Oh, my God.
It was amazing.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.208
But?
But I overheard something.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.410
I think the producer's financing
the film with laundered money,

28:31.443 --> 28:33.212
and I don't know,
if I open an investigation,

28:33.245 --> 28:34.914
I-I-I blow
the whole thing up.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.383
Or do I just say nothing?

28:37.416 --> 28:41.954
The bigger question is, are you
really ready to quit on the FBI

28:41.988 --> 28:44.123
when you're just getting
started?

28:44.156 --> 28:46.225
The AUSA signed off
on Logan's deal,

28:46.258 --> 28:48.427
and he says Quincannon's
house is in Miami.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.929
Wheels up in 30.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.764
Okay.
Thanks, boss.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.871
Oh, yo, miss, could I have
a rum and Coke, please?

28:58.905 --> 29:00.706
Do I look like
a flight attendant to you?

29:00.739 --> 29:01.740
Don't answer that.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.575
Why is he here?

29:03.609 --> 29:05.912
Logan spent two weeks
at Quincannon's Miami residence

29:05.945 --> 29:07.313
becoming him,
but he was blindfolded

29:07.346 --> 29:09.481
to and from the airport,
so all he knows

29:09.515 --> 29:11.483
is that it's some
"big ass spot" on the water.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.719
Which describes
half of Miami.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.154
What we know about Quincannon

29:15.187 --> 29:17.556
is he's a paranoid recluse
with a ton of enemies.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.893
So he'd be looking
for seclusion, security.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.429
Control is paramount
for a guy like him.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.465
And Miami has a ton of private
islands that offer just that.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.134
Yeah, that's the problem.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.636
It leaves hundreds of homes
that fit that profile.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.404
Well, by the time we land,
I expect us to figure out

29:32.438 --> 29:33.472
which one it is.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.506
How are we
going to do that?

29:34.540 --> 29:36.142
You tell me.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.144
It's the reason why
I chose each of you, hmm?

29:38.177 --> 29:39.745
To be outside-the-box thinkers.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.747
I mean,
this is a long shot,

29:41.780 --> 29:44.984
but there is an acting technique
that uses sensory detail.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.519
I-I could walk Logan through
his ride from the airport,

29:47.553 --> 29:49.321
his memory, and see if maybe
there's some clues

29:49.355 --> 29:50.857
as to where
Quincannon took him.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.458
Give it a shot.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.492
Alright,
we're going to have you

29:53.525 --> 29:55.527
take a couple
of deep breaths.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.937
Alright.
Now you're inside the SUV.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.973
They've just
put the blindfold on you.

30:07.006 --> 30:09.641
Tell us what you feel.
And focus on one sense.

30:09.675 --> 30:12.278
What do you hear as you
pull away from the airport?

30:12.311 --> 30:13.612
It's getting louder.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.714
Okay.

30:15.747 --> 30:19.518
And we're speeding up,

30:19.551 --> 30:21.387
like we're going
on a freeway.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.389
There are two freeways
out of Miami International

30:23.422 --> 30:26.325
that head towards the ocean,
the 112 and the 836.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.994
The 112 is a toll road.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.328
Do you remember
stopping at a toll?

30:29.361 --> 30:31.363
No, no. No toll.

30:31.397 --> 30:32.965
So it's the 836, then.

30:32.999 --> 30:37.469
Then we start to slow down
as the road starts to change.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.138
Okay, maybe you're
on a new road.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.974
What do you taste
and smell?

30:42.008 --> 30:44.043
Salt water,

30:44.076 --> 30:47.713
like we're on
some sort of bridge.

30:47.746 --> 30:50.416
Highway 836 feeds right
into the MacArthur Causeway.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.519
And then we're on that road
for like couple minutes.

30:53.552 --> 30:56.655
And then we stop,
and I hear a blinker.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.892
We're turning.
Right or left?

30:59.926 --> 31:02.328
Left.
Yep, we're turning left.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.530
There are three islands
off the causeway.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.665
There's Star, Palm,
and Hibiscus.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.201
And then
the window rolls down,

31:09.235 --> 31:13.872
and the driver's talking to
the security guard in Spanish.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.608
What is he saying?
<i>Vamos</i>

31:16.642 --> 31:19.411
<i>a número ciento</i>

31:19.445 --> 31:21.180
<i>treinta y dos.</i>

31:21.213 --> 31:23.615
Number 132.
That's a house number.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.751
But all three islands
have houses with that number.

31:25.784 --> 31:26.953
What do you hear next?

31:26.986 --> 31:29.388
Gate opens,
and we pull forward.

31:29.421 --> 31:32.959
The road is, um-- it's bumpy.
It's uneven.

31:32.992 --> 31:36.562
132 Star Island
has a cobblestone driveway.

31:36.595 --> 31:37.930
Hey, here.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.398
You recognize that house?

31:39.431 --> 31:41.533
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's it.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.469
It's owned by a shell corp
registered in Luxembourg.

31:43.502 --> 31:46.238
Luxembourg? That's where
Quincannon was last seen.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.607
This is a lot of conjecture.
I don't know, Matt.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.743
How sure are you?

31:51.777 --> 31:53.812
That's his place.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.147
I'm calling in
for a warrant.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.250
Good job. Wow.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.152
Have you seen
the sous vide?

32:00.186 --> 32:01.487
FBI! Freeze!

32:01.520 --> 32:03.055
Show me your hands!

32:03.089 --> 32:04.556
<i>Where's Quincannon?</i>
Who?

32:04.590 --> 32:06.292
Victor Quincannon.
Never heard of him.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.427
I'm Andrew Wilson.
This is my wife, Mindy.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.661
You two own this house?

32:09.695 --> 32:10.963
No, we're just renting.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.164
We moved in two months ago.

32:12.198 --> 32:15.334
ID checks out.
Andrew Wilson.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.969
House is clear.
No Quincannon.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.770
Looks like we hit
the wrong place.

32:18.804 --> 32:21.007
Guess we should have
knocked first.

32:21.040 --> 32:21.940
Our bad.

32:26.112 --> 32:29.748
The SAC is gonna
eat this one up.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.817
That sense memory thing
was yet another bust.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.852
No, that was clever.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.821
This one
wasn't your fault.

32:35.854 --> 32:37.689
Wonder how
we got it so wrong.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.625
I don't know.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.327
You say you've been
renting for two months?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.829
Yeah. We moved here
from Chicago.

32:43.862 --> 32:45.297
Couldn't take
the winters anymore.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.865
So who's this Quincannon guy
you're after?

32:46.898 --> 32:48.834
Well, unfortunately,
we can't talk about

32:48.867 --> 32:51.303
ongoing investigations,
but we can get you squared away

32:51.337 --> 32:53.539
with the paperwork
for reimbursement.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.774
And I'll add your shoes
to the damage assessment.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.077
Don't worry, it's fine.
I got plenty of sneakers.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.613
Appreciate that, sir.
But it's policy.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.982
Give me one second
while I-I grab a form.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.718
Simone?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.522
So this guy's
from Chicago, right?

33:10.556 --> 33:12.191
But he just said he had
"plenty of sneakers."

33:12.224 --> 33:14.160
Yeah, so?
I'm born and raised there.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.295
Chicagoans don't say "sneakers,"
we say "gym shoes."

33:16.328 --> 33:17.863
North Side, West Side,
South Side,

33:17.896 --> 33:20.032
everybody calls them
"gym shoes." That's a fact.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.867
So what you thinking?

33:21.900 --> 33:24.503
A true paranoid wouldn't just
stop at having a body double.

33:24.536 --> 33:27.073
What if Quincannon
changed his own appearance?

33:27.106 --> 33:29.408
Into Andrew?
Well, if he had plastic surgery,

33:29.441 --> 33:30.909
there'd be subtle scars.

33:30.942 --> 33:32.178
I could get close enough,

33:32.211 --> 33:34.813
but I'd have to go
full Simone.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.215
Charm away.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.852
Got it.

33:40.886 --> 33:42.488
Ooh, you got
a pretty smile.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.689
No offense, girl.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.491
Alright, let's see here.

It's just a little.

36:19.578 --> 36:23.382
I'm on medication,
so you don't have to worry.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.551
Look, I will deny this
if you tell anyone,

36:25.584 --> 36:26.818
but you're
my favorite uncle,

36:26.852 --> 36:28.987
and I'd be sad
if you kicked the bucket.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.189
That's, uh, sweet,
I guess.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.725
Okay, so,
between us, right?

36:33.759 --> 36:35.427
Hell no.
I gotta tell Amá.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.229
Elena--
Sorry, not sorry.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.365
You have no willpower, Tío.
The only thing

36:39.398 --> 36:40.599
that's going to keep you
on the straight and narrow

36:40.632 --> 36:41.833
is fear of your sisters.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.335
No, no, no.
I'm not afraid of them.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.036
Okay, fine.
I'm a little afraid.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.339
But just, look,
let me tell them, hmm?

36:47.373 --> 36:49.908
At dinner on Sunday.
Deal?

36:49.941 --> 36:51.443
Deal.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.645
Love you.
I love you, too.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.053
Morning.
Close the door.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.958
I told the FOAs yesterday

37:06.992 --> 37:09.027
that there's three reasons
informants snitch--

37:09.060 --> 37:11.062
to get out of trouble,
to get revenge,

37:11.096 --> 37:12.531
to serve their country.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.933
But apparently
there's a fourth.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.703
The promise of an A-SAC position
in New Orleans.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.572
That's a pretty
sweet deal.

37:20.606 --> 37:21.640
Tracy, huh?

37:21.673 --> 37:23.542
You knew?

37:23.575 --> 37:25.944
I figured,
but Elena confirmed.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.547
Never underestimate
the Bureau's assistant network.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.049
Honestly, I think
they secretly run this place.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.918
When you said not to put
a case number on Quincannon,

37:32.951 --> 37:34.720
I considered going to her.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.657
But this unit,
it's succeeding.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.326
I couldn't undermine that.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.494
I understand if you want
to transfer me out of here.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.998
This is
the original report.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.935
You generated a case number
from the beginning.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.903
W-What was this,
a loyalty test?

37:51.937 --> 37:53.605
Simone and Brendon

37:53.639 --> 37:55.574
are like kids at Christmas
getting to do this job.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.343
And Laura,
this is her lifeline.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.745
She'd never put that at risk.
But you?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.847
You're the only one who doesn't
have to be here, Carter.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.582
But I do hope you'll stay.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.184
I'd like to.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.786
But between us,
Tracy has threatened

38:07.819 --> 38:09.588
to make my life harder
if I don't come through.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.656
Well,
don't worry about her.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.659
When she comes for us--
and she will--

38:13.692 --> 38:15.594
we'll deal with her.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.595
Together.

38:19.465 --> 38:22.200
♪ 'Cause I'll be right here
by your side ♪

38:22.233 --> 38:23.369
♪ Friends gotta do it right

38:23.402 --> 38:26.137
♪ Yeah, we work hard,
work hard ♪

38:26.171 --> 38:27.673
♪ Morning, noon, night

38:29.475 --> 38:30.642
What are you doing
in my neighborhood?

38:30.676 --> 38:32.378
How do you know
this is my neighborhood?

38:32.411 --> 38:35.381
Did my research
and ran a profile on you.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.816
Oh, really?

38:37.849 --> 38:39.184
And what did you find out?

38:39.217 --> 38:41.119
Well, that the reason
you're so hard on me

38:41.152 --> 38:43.455
is because
you need me to succeed.

38:43.489 --> 38:46.057
Because I am
a reflection of you,

38:46.091 --> 38:48.193
and your self-esteem
has taken a pretty massive hit

38:48.226 --> 38:50.161
in the last year.
Careful, probie.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.863
All I'm saying is that,
in a weird way,

38:51.897 --> 38:54.332
you and me,
we're like, oh, partners--

38:54.366 --> 38:57.002
equally invested
in my success.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.370
You're not
buying that, huh?

38:58.404 --> 39:00.472
No.

39:00.506 --> 39:03.141
Okay. Well, how would
you like to go with me

39:03.174 --> 39:04.743
to recruit
a Simone-level informant

39:04.776 --> 39:07.012
and sabotage the best
acting role I'll ever get?

39:08.547 --> 39:09.214
I'll get dressed.

39:12.283 --> 39:14.720
Come in.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.155
Hey, Ross. How you doing?
Oh. Hey, Brendon.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.491
Are you here to see Dylan?
No, you.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.493
Smart man.
Come to sweet-talk me

39:21.527 --> 39:23.228
into making a formal offer
for the film.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.696
Oh, is this your agent?

39:24.730 --> 39:25.764
She's hot.
You're hot.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.165
No, not his agent.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.502
But I am a <i>federal</i> agent,
as is Brendon.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.603
A what?

39:31.637 --> 39:33.572
Came here to talk about
Nightcloud Films.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.240
What about it?

39:35.273 --> 39:37.208
I did a little bit of digging
into your financials.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.511
Uh, good job
hiding that money

39:39.545 --> 39:41.713
you're laundering
for that Serbian mafia outfit.

39:41.747 --> 39:44.182
That's-- That's good.
It's too bad I'm a bloodhound

39:44.215 --> 39:45.784
when it comes to
finding dirty money.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.085
You wouldn't believe

39:47.118 --> 39:49.387
how many transactions
have come through that account.

39:49.421 --> 39:52.458
Adds up to one,
maybe two decades in prison.

39:52.491 --> 39:56.562
Mm. Unless you want
to make a deal,

39:56.595 --> 39:59.030
become my informant.

39:59.064 --> 39:59.798
Yeah.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.068
Don't get cocky.

40:10.476 --> 40:12.844
Mm-hmm.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.247
You sure do
keep long hours.

40:16.281 --> 40:18.484
You know
what makes up for it?

40:18.517 --> 40:21.219
Using intel from
a neighborhood pill pusher

40:21.252 --> 40:23.388
to arrest
a dangerous arms dealer.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.456
Is that so?

40:24.490 --> 40:27.125
The charges against Anton
were dropped.

40:27.158 --> 40:31.162
Due to his cooperation,
he has a fresh start.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.898
Even if the fool
doesn't realize

40:32.931 --> 40:34.766
when you're
a confidential informant,

40:34.800 --> 40:37.302
you can't go flapping your jaws
telling everybody.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.437
Ah, he gets that
from his daddy.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.809
Yeah. I see you.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.612
How you're trying to make
a difference in your own way.

40:46.645 --> 40:50.281
Doesn't mean I'mma always
be a fan of your methods.

40:50.315 --> 40:53.451
But, yeah, I see you.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.321
Daddy.
Ah.

40:56.354 --> 40:58.657
Mm-hmm...

40:58.690 --> 41:01.493
Oh, no, my baby.

41:01.527 --> 41:04.129
You-- You dented Precious?
What?

41:04.162 --> 41:05.864
And then you tried
to cover it up?

41:05.897 --> 41:07.365
Daddy,
how can you tell?

41:07.398 --> 41:08.634
A father knows.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.502
Oh, my God.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.678
