It seems I need
to add a new element

09:30.070 --> 09:31.636
to my assault.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.838
Good medical,
you know, for heroes?

09:33.840 --> 09:34.606
Hey!

09:34.608 --> 09:35.807
That cost 20 bucks!

09:35.809 --> 09:37.242
No! No, no, no!

09:37.244 --> 09:42.113
I'm putting a place-holder
in my memory for you, boy.

09:42.115 --> 09:47.118
This isn't the last you've seen
of the Mathter!

09:47.120 --> 09:49.120
Ok, lame villain.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.823
But I like the hat.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.828
What's gotten into
your father lately?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.730
Can't talk.
Typing hero report.

09:58.732 --> 10:02.233
Now he's joined the Middleton
search and rescue.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.703
It's risky behavior
for an actuary.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.871
I just hate to think about him

10:06.873 --> 10:08.373
out there in the wilderness

10:08.375 --> 10:09.774
with all those wild animals.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.443
Eh, he'll be fine.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.612
Help! Help!

10:13.614 --> 10:15.780
[Bear roars]

10:17.851 --> 10:20.485
No, no, you can't crash now!

10:20.487 --> 10:22.754
My report!
No, my report!

10:22.756 --> 10:24.189
Ow, ow, ow!

10:24.191 --> 10:27.392
Oh, man, like I have time
for a systems failure.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.394
I'm late for school as it is.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.729
Hmm?

10:30.731 --> 10:33.198
Hmm...

10:34.367 --> 10:35.634
Can you believe it, kp?

10:35.636 --> 10:37.836
Just when I was making
major headway,

10:37.838 --> 10:39.904
crash city! I mean,
what am I gonna tell...

10:39.906 --> 10:41.740
hold it right there, Stoppable.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.742
What exactly
do you think you're doing?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.844
Uh, dutifully heading to class?

10:45.846 --> 10:47.545
Really? Well,
according to my records,

10:47.547 --> 10:49.447
you're no longer
registered in this school

10:49.449 --> 10:51.583
and therefore
no longer in the class.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.785
Ok, you think
you could explain that

10:53.787 --> 10:56.621
do I have to
spell it out for you?

10:56.623 --> 10:57.822
Spelling out's best.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.892
Are not on the list
of enrolled students,

11:00.894 --> 11:03.828
so technically,
you do not exist.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.830
Wait a minute.
Of course I exist!

11:05.832 --> 11:08.767
I mean, hello, I'm right
here in front of you!

11:08.769 --> 11:10.201
So I smell.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.403
But, the list is law.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.571
And I am not going
to argue with the computer.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.740
Maybe it knows
something I don't.

11:15.742 --> 11:16.941
No doubt. But...

11:16.943 --> 11:18.176
oh, wait a minute.

11:18.178 --> 11:22.447
Then I'm not required
to do the paper, right?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.848
Wronggguh!

11:23.850 --> 11:25.417
You were given the assignment

11:25.419 --> 11:26.584
when you still existed.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.788
I'd utilize
my newly-found free time

11:29.790 --> 11:31.790
to get to work.

11:32.893 --> 11:37.762
We'll straighten it out
before you can say "no big."

11:37.764 --> 11:38.730
I don't know, kp,

11:38.732 --> 11:40.331
first the computer thing,

11:40.333 --> 11:41.866
then the school records.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.535
I mean, could...
this day get any worse?

11:43.537 --> 11:44.769
It will if you say that.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.871
Hi. Do you think
I could get my check?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.440
Stoppable, Ron.

11:48.442 --> 11:51.543
Yah, sorry. There is
no check here for you.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.510
Here we go.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.245
What? Well,
can you look again?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.247
The name's Ron,
as in, Stoppable?

11:56.249 --> 11:57.749
Whoa, dude,
aren't you listening?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.484
I told you there's no check.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.985
As in, you know, for you?

12:00.987 --> 12:02.620
Maybe just
thinking it is enough.

12:02.622 --> 12:06.357
It looks like you're not on
the employee roster, either.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.727
So, on your next visit,
it might be best

12:08.729 --> 12:12.897
if you return your smarty mart
hat and smarty smock.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.967
Ok, not according
to the roster.

12:15.969 --> 12:19.904
But if you'd like, you can
fill out an application!

12:19.906 --> 12:21.740
Oh... Maybe I don't exist

12:21.742 --> 12:23.808
and this is all just a dream.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.910
But whose dream?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.979
Wade, we've got
a mystery sitch.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.681
It looks like Ron's
off the grid.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.549
I'm already on it.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.617
Uh-oh.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.852
Uh-oh good
or uh-oh bad?

12:33.854 --> 12:34.819
When is uh-oh
ever good?

12:34.821 --> 12:36.855
I don't know!
Maybe this time.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.723
No school records,
no driving records,

12:38.725 --> 12:39.958
no work records?
<i>Nada.</i>

12:39.960 --> 12:41.926
It's like all traces
of his existence

12:41.928 --> 12:42.994
have been erased.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.730
But who would
want to erase Ron?

12:45.732 --> 12:49.567
Ha ha! Don't you
mean subtract?

12:49.569 --> 12:52.303
Aw, great,
now the math guy's back.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.939
And he's not even our villain.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.509
[Slurping]

12:59.879 --> 13:01.980
"We're so sorry
you couldn't come with us

13:01.982 --> 13:04.816
on the hero vacation
cruise, hego."

13:04.818 --> 13:06.017
Oh, it's ok, mego.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.921
Other joyous occasions
to bond as a family.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.690
"But we really do
miss you, hego."

13:12.692 --> 13:14.692
But someone had to
look after the place.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.627
You know, keep vigil.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.329
Do some light housekeeping.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.532
I am so lonely.

Uh, hego!

13:21.902 --> 13:22.867
Oh! Hi! Yes.

13:22.869 --> 13:23.935
Oh, don't mind these.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.074
Right. Anyway,

13:30.076 --> 13:33.978
the Mathter is up to more
mathematical mischief in Middleton!

13:33.980 --> 13:35.814
Ooh, impressive use
of alliteration.

you just relax

14:04.044 --> 14:06.911
and have some <i>pi!</i>

14:10.115 --> 14:11.082
Kim!

14:11.084 --> 14:15.453
Now it's your turn
to feel the full wrath

14:15.455 --> 14:16.821
of my math!

14:16.823 --> 14:18.423
Ok, I sure could use,

14:18.425 --> 14:20.024

a hero right about now!

14:20.026 --> 14:24.028
Now, prepare to be subtracted
entirely, because...

14:24.030 --> 14:25.997
because what, my number's up?

14:25.999 --> 14:29.133
Dude, how can you be
so hepped up about math?

14:29.135 --> 14:30.768
Not that I'm judging!

14:30.770 --> 14:32.437
Oh yes, I've worked out

14:32.439 --> 14:34.906
a very special
calculation for you,

work on your timing.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.560
Are those seahorses?

14:57.529 --> 15:00.965
Oh! Now there are simply
too many variables

15:00.967 --> 15:03.568
in this equation.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.770
Oh! I have got
to get hooked up

15:05.772 --> 15:07.772
with one of those copter hats!

15:07.774 --> 15:08.806
Ron, are you ok?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.048
to any special
setting, did you?

Um, not really. Why?

Oh, no, it's just as I feared.

15:25.926 --> 15:29.794
Do you want the good news
or the bad news first?

15:29.796 --> 15:32.697
The Mathter has used
a diabolical equation

15:32.699 --> 15:35.066
to turn Ron into
an antimatter boy.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.568
Everything you touch
will explode

15:37.570 --> 15:39.737
into complete
and utter nothingness.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.006
So that's not
the good news, then.

15:42.008 --> 15:46.511

will be a blast?

by the upside.

containment bubble, dad.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.159
Just another reason
why you're my hero.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.195
Besides, this old thing
was just taking up space

16:04.197 --> 16:05.630
in the attic, anyway.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.999
I always thought hamster balls

16:08.001 --> 16:10.001
looked fun...
from the outside!

to enter Ron's info

Um, ok, maybe the whole
trying to act cool thing

16:31.891 --> 16:33.257
isn't your best option
right now.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.994
Look, kp, you wanted me
to make the best of it,

16:35.996 --> 16:37.862

into the U.N.
Without your pants?

17:10.630 --> 17:13.798
The "I'm all about
comfort" excuse

17:13.800 --> 17:15.733
brought the security
council dress code

17:15.735 --> 17:18.936
see? There's an upside
to everything.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.938
[Watch beeps]
We need an upside, Wade.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.141
I've detected
a high concentration

on the equator.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.279

zero degrees latitude.

use all the hero help

we can get.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.158
Whoa, dad,
what happened to you?

17:40.160 --> 17:43.661
Today I volunteered
at the fire department.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.964
No, in the kitchen.
I made them lunch.

17:46.966 --> 17:50.134
Oh, I, uh,
I started a grease fire.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.969

letting you go without me.

lair looks like.

he's self-insured.

Shh. Be extremely
cautious.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.038
The Mathter has many
tricks up his sleeve,

very well be our last.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.009
Kim:
The calcu-laser!

19:05.011 --> 19:06.944
Ron: Look! It's in
a bubble, too!

19:06.946 --> 19:08.946
Come on, we've got to
change Ron back to normal

19:08.948 --> 19:11.649
before the Mathter
makes an appearance.

19:12.384 --> 19:13.851
Welcome!

19:13.853 --> 19:16.020
I am so glad you're here.

19:16.022 --> 19:19.390
Now we can continue
our little numbers game.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.825
Ok, one more lame-o
math reference

19:20.827 --> 19:21.926
and I'm going to lose it!

19:21.928 --> 19:23.861
Perhaps I can enlighten you

19:23.863 --> 19:26.130
with my flash cards!

19:26.132 --> 19:28.299
Let me guess.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.702
Yep. That was my guess.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.409
Aah!

19:39.077 --> 19:40.344
Game's over, Mathter.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.846
Minus that, girlie.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.147
We're just getting started.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.983
What you've failed to realize

19:45.985 --> 19:51.856
in the culmination
of my mathematical genius!

19:51.858 --> 19:54.392
The infinity dome!

19:54.394 --> 19:57.895
In this experimental cognitive
energy redoubling chamber,

19:57.897 --> 19:59.730
cerebral pulsations
and thought waves

19:59.732 --> 20:00.965
can be exponentially
intensified

20:00.967 --> 20:02.967
to form lethal
streams of energy!

20:02.969 --> 20:08.906
He can turn his twisted-math
mind into a weapon, Ronald.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.476
Now, who amongst you dares
to challenge the Mathter

20:12.478 --> 20:16.347
sorry. I prefer to do things
the old-fashioned way.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.815
Kim! No!

20:17.817 --> 20:19.717
Aah!

20:19.719 --> 20:20.985
Ha ha ha ha

20:20.987 --> 20:22.720
that was so cute.
Too easy!

20:22.722 --> 20:24.889
Nobody is worthy
to stand in the same

20:24.891 --> 20:28.192
experimental cognitive
energy redoubling chamber

20:28.194 --> 20:30.228
as the Mathter.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.997
Prepare to be subtracted!

20:32.999 --> 20:35.900
Ah, excuse me.
I'll take that challenge.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.804
Ronald, crunching
numbers is what I do.

20:39.806 --> 20:43.307
Ho! And what kind
of hero are you?

20:43.309 --> 20:45.142
I'm no hero.

20:45.144 --> 20:48.112
I'm actuary of the year.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.392
Ok, did you have any idea

21:01.394 --> 21:02.860
your dad had it in him?

21:02.862 --> 21:05.997
Who knew we'd be facing
a crazed math villain?

21:05.999 --> 21:08.466
Yep. So convenient.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.435
Aaahhh!

21:11.437 --> 21:14.538
See? They should totally
teach this way in trig.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.806
Totally.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.875
Aah!
Aah!

21:20.979 --> 21:25.016
Come on, dad!
You <i>a</i> a hero!

21:25.851 --> 21:28.152
Aah!

21:30.088 --> 21:35.126
How? How were you ever able
to calculate my every move?

21:35.128 --> 21:37.328
It was easy.
I did the math.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.330
Brackets!

21:39.332 --> 21:43.534
Way to teach the bad guy a
lesson Stoppable style!

21:43.536 --> 21:46.504
Speaking of Stoppable style...

21:47.339 --> 21:50.341
Let's see if I can get
this thing to work.

21:51.376 --> 21:52.810
Hey, hey, all right!

21:52.812 --> 21:54.278
Whoa!
Oh, yeah.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.846
Hey, that's nice.
Ha ha.

21:55.848 --> 21:56.814
I was starting to think

21:56.816 --> 21:58.816
I'd never get to do that again.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.351
[Giggles]

22:00.353 --> 22:04.488
You know, from now on, no
hamster balls for either of us!

22:04.490 --> 22:07.425
Well, I guess
I'll take it from here.

22:07.427 --> 22:10.528
I'll be more than
happy to help you

22:10.530 --> 22:11.896
with the rest of your paper.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.198
But it looks like
I found myself

22:14.200 --> 22:15.566
a new subject for my paper.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.902
You mean it?
I'll get my cape!

22:17.904 --> 22:21.439
No capes!

22:21.441 --> 22:25.443
Interesting report you've
turned in there, Stoppable.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.977
Your dad, aka "hero,"

22:26.979 --> 22:31.082
is a member of the Middleton
search and rescue?

22:31.084 --> 22:32.383
Yep.
Also volunteers

22:32.385 --> 22:34.518
at the local fire department.
Affirmative.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.189
And while in the confines
of a certain infinity dome,

22:38.191 --> 22:39.990
he can convert
pure mathematical thought

22:39.992 --> 22:42.893
into blasts of energy
that fire out of his skull?

22:42.895 --> 22:45.429
Yeah. It's
an actuary thing.

22:45.431 --> 22:48.299
Your dad rocks!
A-plus!
