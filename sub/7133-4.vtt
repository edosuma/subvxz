46:10.400 --> 46:11.567
- Who?

46:11.633 --> 46:13.467
- Dorothy Payne.

46:13.533 --> 46:16.200
She waitressed
up in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

46:18.300 --> 46:20.667
- You confessing another murder?

46:20.734 --> 46:23.500
- Uh-huh.

46:23.567 --> 46:26.767
- I'll notify
the proper authorities.

46:26.834 --> 46:28.333
- Wait.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.266
I also suffocated

46:30.333 --> 46:33.033
Ethel Peterson
and Gertrude Victor...

46:35.266 --> 46:37.734
And Mary Rapp

46:37.800 --> 46:39.767
and Christina Trudell

46:39.834 --> 46:41.767
and Eleanor Hughes,

46:41.834 --> 46:45.667
Wilma Lomax,
Lisa Masters,

46:45.734 --> 46:47.600
And Lorraine McCarthy,

46:47.667 --> 46:49.867
and Betty Case,

46:49.934 --> 46:51.300
and Irene Martin,

46:51.367 --> 46:55.033
and Amelia Nugent,
Elizabeth Phelps,

46:55.100 --> 46:57.166
and Lucille Upton,

46:57.233 --> 46:59.300
and Esther Voght.

46:59.367 --> 47:01.600
[chuckles]
What I did.

47:01.667 --> 47:05.400
- Richard L'Italien confessed
to 39 murders,

47:05.467 --> 47:08.467
all young women.
He suffocated them all.

47:08.533 --> 47:09.834
- If the governor
had his way,

47:09.900 --> 47:13.133
he would execute L'Italien
39 times.

47:14.033 --> 47:15.767
- I have to get over there.

47:15.834 --> 47:19.934
- Ray, listen...

47:20.000 --> 47:22.200
how can you
go along with this?

47:22.266 --> 47:24.633
You're as much against
the death penalty as I am.

47:24.700 --> 47:26.200
- Of course I am, Pete.

47:26.266 --> 47:27.633
I don't know.

47:27.700 --> 47:29.834
Maybe if anyone
deserves to die,

47:29.900 --> 47:31.467
Richard L'Italien
deserves to die.

47:31.533 --> 47:32.800
Maybe the world will,
what?

47:32.867 --> 47:34.834
Breathe a little easier
once he's gone.

47:34.900 --> 47:37.200
My job is not
to make judgments.

47:37.266 --> 47:40.700
My job is to be
by his side.

47:40.767 --> 47:42.734
My place...

47:42.800 --> 47:46.033
is with him.

47:46.100 --> 47:48.500
If he needs me.

47:52.066 --> 47:54.133
[whispers]
Pray for him, Mary.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.667
That's for him.

48:00.834 --> 48:02.800
That's for all of them.

48:12.433 --> 48:15.567
- Have you ever had
bull's balls, Father?

48:15.633 --> 48:17.767
- No, sir, I can't
say that I have.

48:17.834 --> 48:19.333
- Well, they serve them
every year

48:19.400 --> 48:22.533
at the Bohemian Grove.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.934
- What's that,
that's a restaurant?

48:24.000 --> 48:27.367
- Oh, man, you never
heard of Bohemian Grove?

48:27.433 --> 48:29.734
[laughs]
It's a retreat

48:29.800 --> 48:30.867
in San Francisco.

48:30.934 --> 48:34.266
You know,
for investment brokers,

48:34.333 --> 48:38.000
bankers, politicians,
intellectuals.

48:38.066 --> 48:40.166
I'm amazed you're
not hip to it.

48:40.233 --> 48:42.734
Of course,
I grew up in the Bay Area,

48:42.800 --> 48:45.066
so we always knew
when it was happening.

48:45.133 --> 48:48.633
Even as a kid,
I always wanted to go, you know.

48:48.700 --> 48:50.367
Wow.

48:50.433 --> 48:52.567
Wouldn't that be something?

48:52.633 --> 48:56.467
Swimming the Russian River
with some Secretary of State,

48:56.533 --> 48:58.166
pissing on a redwood
next to Donald Trump.

48:58.233 --> 48:59.934
[laughs]

49:00.000 --> 49:03.233
I mean,
these guys are the elite,

49:03.300 --> 49:05.333
men of power.

49:05.400 --> 49:08.200
Men!
[grunts]

49:09.467 --> 49:11.166
[sighs]

49:11.233 --> 49:13.300
Women were excluded,

49:13.367 --> 49:16.300
but the
Supreme-fucking-Court

49:16.367 --> 49:18.867
forced the Bohemian
to let the "coozes" in.

49:18.934 --> 49:20.734
Can you believe that shit?

49:20.800 --> 49:22.500
Once they were in,

49:22.567 --> 49:25.433
I wanted nothing to do with it.
I was done.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.700
- But who knows the women
you would have met.

49:27.767 --> 49:30.734
- Not the kind of woman
I'd want to fuck.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.266
- There's a big
difference between

49:32.333 --> 49:34.433
wanting to fuck a woman
and wanting to kill her.

49:34.500 --> 49:36.834
- Is there?

49:39.533 --> 49:42.000
Have you ever been laid, Father?

49:44.200 --> 49:45.767
- No.

49:45.834 --> 49:48.433
- Then what would
you know about pussy?

49:48.500 --> 49:50.200
And what would
you know about...

49:50.266 --> 49:52.967
[clears throat]
Anything?

49:53.033 --> 49:55.033
- All I know is that
once upon a time,

49:55.100 --> 49:58.834
you wanted to walk in the woods
with important people

49:58.900 --> 50:01.800
and now, instead,

50:01.867 --> 50:02.934
you're here.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.033
- I'm here because

50:05.100 --> 50:07.000
I love women.

50:07.066 --> 50:10.500
I love every woman I see.

50:10.567 --> 50:13.500
Tall ones,
thin ones, fatties...

50:13.567 --> 50:15.133
It's true.

50:15.200 --> 50:18.500
You know, I once worked
a circus one summer,

50:18.567 --> 50:21.367
and I fucked the dwarf
while the fat lady watched us.

50:21.433 --> 50:22.834
Mm-hmm.

50:22.900 --> 50:26.667
I fucked trailer park trash
in West Virginia,

50:26.734 --> 50:29.767
I fucked rich girls up the ass,
in Aspen,

50:29.834 --> 50:33.233
I fucked PhDs, retards...

50:34.667 --> 50:38.166
You know, once I fucked an
amputee with both legs missing.

50:38.233 --> 50:42.600
- Fucking them isn't the same
as loving them.

50:42.667 --> 50:46.934
- You sound just like
a shrink I had once in juvie.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.266
She tried to tell me
that I hated women.

50:50.333 --> 50:53.066
[chuckles]
I showed her.

50:54.967 --> 50:56.567
- You fucked her.

50:56.633 --> 50:58.533
- And her daughter.

50:58.600 --> 51:01.133
Then I snuffed 'em both.

51:03.100 --> 51:06.367
- If you love women so much,

51:06.433 --> 51:07.700
why do you kill them?

51:07.767 --> 51:09.567
Because...

51:09.633 --> 51:12.066
when you love someone,
they own you,

51:12.133 --> 51:14.834
they possess you!

51:14.900 --> 51:17.867
[clears throat]
I will not be possessed.

51:22.934 --> 51:25.734
- I'm here to give you
absolution for your sins.

51:25.800 --> 51:27.767
Do you wish to be absolved?

51:27.834 --> 51:29.800
- Fuck, yes!
[clears throat]

51:34.000 --> 51:35.233
Shit!

51:36.867 --> 51:39.700
You know, they told me
I could order anything I wanted

51:39.767 --> 51:42.467
as my last meal.
[chuckles]

51:42.533 --> 51:45.333
I shoulda ordered
bull's balls!

51:50.266 --> 51:52.700
I'm really not ready for this.

51:52.767 --> 51:54.934
Oh, man.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.800
- First the inmate's
given sodium pentathol,

51:58.867 --> 52:02.100
the same anesthetic used
in hospitals for major surgery.

52:02.166 --> 52:05.767
Then a massive dose
of pancuronium bromide.

52:05.834 --> 52:08.500
That paralyzes the diaphragm.

52:08.567 --> 52:12.100
Then potassuim chloride
to stop the heart.

52:12.166 --> 52:13.900
- [groans]

52:16.000 --> 52:17.567
[exhales]

52:21.667 --> 52:23.834
- Don't try this at home, kids.

52:25.266 --> 52:27.633
- It's finished.

52:33.533 --> 52:35.033
- Ah, hello.

52:35.934 --> 52:37.400
- Hello.

52:45.100 --> 52:47.867
- Christ was executed,
you know...

52:48.734 --> 52:50.934
And if he hadn't been,

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
the world would be
a very different place.

52:55.066 --> 52:58.767
- A better place?

52:58.834 --> 53:01.000
- I didn't say that.

53:07.600 --> 53:10.100
I want my job back.

53:10.166 --> 53:11.567
- Okay.

53:11.633 --> 53:13.333
- I don't have to beg?

53:13.400 --> 53:15.266
- If it'll make you
feel better, beg.

53:15.333 --> 53:17.100
- I just want you to know
I still disagree with you

53:17.166 --> 53:18.667
on the death penalty.

53:18.734 --> 53:21.300
- Even for a cyst
like L'Italien?

53:21.367 --> 53:23.700
- Oh, Leo,
"thou shalt not kill."

53:23.767 --> 53:25.567
The Bible makes
that pretty clear.

53:25.633 --> 53:28.900
You cannot take
a human life for any reason.

53:28.967 --> 53:31.266
- Yeah, but the bible also says,

53:31.333 --> 53:32.967
"an eye for an eye,"

53:33.033 --> 53:34.333
which says to me that

53:34.400 --> 53:37.200
if you kill, you die.

53:37.266 --> 53:40.467
Seems to me god's talking
out both sides of his mouth.

53:41.533 --> 53:45.300
Maybe he's as confused about the
death penalty as the rest of us.

53:45.367 --> 53:47.633
All I know for sure is...

53:47.700 --> 53:49.834
No one's going to claim
L'Italien's body,

53:49.900 --> 53:52.700
so we're going to stick him
in a cheap pine box,

53:52.767 --> 53:55.800
stamp an ID number on the lid

53:55.867 --> 53:59.333
and throw him in a hole
at Potter's Field.

53:59.400 --> 54:02.266
There he'll be...

54:02.333 --> 54:04.734
with no one to grieve for him.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.200
- I grieve for him.

54:07.266 --> 54:08.633
- Yeah I know.

54:08.700 --> 54:10.100
That's why I love you.

54:10.166 --> 54:12.567
That's why I'm glad you're back.

54:24.667 --> 54:28.033
- There's this brother
on death row somewheres.

54:28.100 --> 54:31.000
He checked in when he was 16.

54:31.066 --> 54:34.033
He sat there another 16 years

54:34.100 --> 54:38.033
while the courts and lawyers
argued about this and that.

54:38.100 --> 54:41.233
While he waited,
he painted a mural on his wall.

54:41.300 --> 54:42.533
For all those years,
he painted,

54:42.600 --> 54:44.533
not letting a soul see
what he was up to.

54:44.600 --> 54:47.333
Finally, when he was 32
and had spent more life

54:47.400 --> 54:50.233
on death row
than in his momma's house,

54:50.300 --> 54:53.100
all his appeals were exhausted.

54:53.166 --> 54:55.166
He was about to die.

54:55.233 --> 54:57.667
As he was about to be led out
for the final time,

54:57.734 --> 55:01.200
he finally unveiled
his masterpiece.

55:01.266 --> 55:04.467
All there was were six words.

55:04.533 --> 55:08.033
"Death is certain
life is not."

55:09.433 --> 55:11.834
The next day,
the hacks painted over it.

55:14.834 --> 55:16.433
Peace out.
