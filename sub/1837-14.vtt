WEBVTT

00:05.133 --> 00:07.300
D.J.:
Okay, we know you're pumped

00:07.300 --> 00:10.734
about tonight's Boys In Motion
"Motion at Midnight" concert,

00:10.734 --> 00:14.700
and we're giving away all-access
wristbands to our tenth caller.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.100
No more calls. We have a winner.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.700
Oh, man! Come on.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.567
What, do you have to be, like,
psychic to win these contests?

00:24.567 --> 00:28.834
Caller number ten
in the hizz-ouse!

00:30.467 --> 00:33.900
Boys In Motion tickets are going
to be in my hands, people.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.767
I'm going
to the concert.

00:35.767 --> 00:37.367
This is so unfair.

00:37.367 --> 00:38.667
I wanted to go.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.600
Chels,
I won two tickets.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.300
Sure, Rae. Rub it in.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.133
Okay, let's...
let's start
this over again.

00:46.133 --> 00:49.400
Hey, Chels,
you want to go to
the concert with me?

00:49.400 --> 00:51.734
Whoa! Hey, that's kind
of out of nowhere,

00:51.734 --> 00:53.900
but sure, yeah,
that would be great.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.000
Okay. Great. Yay!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.967
before the big game
against Jefferson,

01:33.967 --> 01:36.400
they steal our mascot--
Barry Barracuda-- right?

01:36.400 --> 01:39.800
No.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.867
Why must you make everything
so difficult, Chelsea?

01:42.867 --> 01:44.400
What did you do?

01:44.400 --> 01:49.767
Okay, well, this year, Rae,
I stole<i>their </i>mascot.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.800
(<i>laughing </i>)

01:53.200 --> 01:55.467
Ladies, meet Gomez--

01:55.467 --> 01:59.100
the Jefferson mascot.
(<i>goat bleating </i>)

02:01.600 --> 02:02.967
You stole the goat?

02:02.967 --> 02:05.000
Yeah. But it's only
until after the game, okay?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.900
I mean, without their mascot,
they'll be totally psyched out.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.233
We'll finally beat them, right?

02:09.233 --> 02:12.133
We couldn't beat them
if we stole the whole team.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.367
You know what? This stinks.

02:15.367 --> 02:18.500
Yeah, Gomez is kind of ripe.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.500
No, Rae. What stinks
is making an innocent animal

02:21.500 --> 02:24.000
parade around
in this ridiculous outfit.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.400
Yeah. Chelsea's right.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.600
That hat is so 1776.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.000
(<i>laughing </i>):
1776.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.734
Okay. Okay, Rae,
you can laugh all you want,

02:34.734 --> 02:38.300

All right! All right!
All right! All right! All right!

04:15.934 --> 04:19.100
Now, I am sick and tired of
Jefferson stealing our mascot

04:19.100 --> 04:20.834
every year before the Big Game.

04:20.834 --> 04:23.600
(<i>all agreeing </i>)

04:23.600 --> 04:26.500
Now, this year,
it is not going to happen

04:26.500 --> 04:28.700
because we've been keeping
a very watchful eye

04:28.700 --> 04:30.200
on Barry Barracuda.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.400
Have we not? Have we not?

04:35.200 --> 04:38.400
Which is what

04:38.400 --> 04:40.000
Jefferson should
have been doing

04:40.000 --> 04:41.834
with their mascot,
Gomez the goat.

04:41.834 --> 04:43.700
That's right.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.300
Thomas, did you
steal the goat?

04:47.800 --> 04:49.500
Well, uh... Big D,
let's just say

04:49.500 --> 04:51.400
that this school
is about to get some

04:51.400 --> 04:53.000
very long-overdue respect.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.500
Fellow Barracudas,
I give you...

04:57.500 --> 04:58.667
Rae!

05:03.900 --> 05:06.767
Your stinking goat
ain't in here.

05:06.767 --> 05:07.834
What?

05:11.600 --> 05:12.867
But here.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.667
This is good
enough, right?

05:16.300 --> 05:18.734
The game's
tonight, Thomas.

05:18.734 --> 05:20.500
You had us all pumped.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.000
Now we're bummed.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.567
And we don't win
when we're bummed.

05:24.567 --> 05:25.900
Man, ya'll

05:25.900 --> 05:28.100
must have been bummed every
game, 'cause y'all...

05:28.100 --> 05:29.033
Rae! Rae.

05:29.033 --> 05:31.033
Rae. Rae. Rae.

05:31.033 --> 05:33.200
I got this, okay?

05:34.300 --> 05:36.300
Don't worry, Big D.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.467
Okay, now,

05:37.467 --> 05:39.467
the goat's going to
be at the game, dawg.

05:39.467 --> 05:42.100
It better be.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.000
Because,
if you don't find it,

05:44.000 --> 05:45.600
I'm going to find you.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.500
(<i>snaps fingers </i>)

05:49.500 --> 05:51.000
Let's go.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.200
Why is he so mean?

05:53.200 --> 05:55.734
Why he gotta be so mean?

05:55.734 --> 05:57.000
Okay. All right.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.800
We're just trying
to help out.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.767
Hey, all the pretty
ladies following Big D.

06:00.767 --> 06:03.500
Okay, Big D!

06:03.500 --> 06:05.467
Rae, what we gon' do?

06:05.467 --> 06:07.233
I don't know about<i>we,</i>

06:07.233 --> 06:09.467
but<i>me's </i>going to the concert.

06:12.300 --> 06:15.800
Ooh, Dad,
I'm right on your tail!

06:18.600 --> 06:20.900
Yes! Your ship
is vaporized.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.800
Uh-uh.
It's not over yet.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.967
I still got
two ships left.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.200
Okay, one ship.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.800
Okay, no ships.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.600
Okay, game's over. Oh!

06:31.600 --> 06:33.500
I need some real competition.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.867
I'm going to play
on the Internet.

06:35.867 --> 06:39.000
Now I can crush kids
from all over the world.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.300
Well, keep in mind

06:40.300 --> 06:41.867
the world's
a big place.

06:41.867 --> 06:43.233
You might lose.

06:43.233 --> 06:44.667
(<i>laughing </i>)

06:44.667 --> 06:46.200
Good one, Dad.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.233
Okay, bring it on.

06:50.233 --> 06:51.467
(<i>typing </i>)

06:51.467 --> 06:53.300
Let's see who's out there.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.300
Ooh! I got someone...

06:55.300 --> 06:58.100
in Hong Kong.

06:59.133 --> 07:03.100
"Jing Yee."

07:03.100 --> 07:05.600
"Corey."

07:05.600 --> 07:07.000
Ah!

07:07.000 --> 07:10.100
(<i>speaking Chinese </i>):

07:10.100 --> 07:13.033
Let the game begin.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.500
Rae, a messenger
brought this

07:24.500 --> 07:26.600
for you this afternoon.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.834
(<i>screaming </i>)

07:32.834 --> 07:35.600
It's the Boys In Motion
wristband!

07:35.600 --> 07:37.233
I can't believe
you were the tenth caller.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.300
Mom! Mom, you
were listening?

07:39.300 --> 07:42.500
I was trying to get in
all afternoon.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.400
That's why
there's no dinner.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.100
Mama, can you believe it?

07:46.100 --> 07:47.700
Boys In Motion!

07:47.700 --> 07:49.200
"Motion at Midnight."

07:49.200 --> 07:50.600
It's so exciting!

07:50.600 --> 07:53.300
I should take a nap
before the limo comes.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.734
Why?

07:55.734 --> 07:57.500
So I won't be tired

07:57.500 --> 08:00.800
when the boys
start their motion.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.200
Oh, Mom!

08:03.200 --> 08:04.700
Mom! Oh, Mama!

08:04.700 --> 08:06.100
Mama, come here.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.867
Oh, I love you.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.300
I want to thank you

08:10.300 --> 08:12.934
for bringing me
into this world.

08:12.934 --> 08:14.200
Oh, honey.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.500
How can I say
this nicely?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.400
You ain't goin'.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.367
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:24.367 --> 08:26.100
I already
promised Chelsea.

08:26.100 --> 08:31.300
Oh. Oh. Well,
I'm still taking a nap.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.734
That's too much
motion for Mama.

08:33.734 --> 08:35.600
You girls have fun.

08:36.834 --> 08:39.100
(<i>squeals </i>)

08:39.100 --> 08:42.000
Hey, Rae, can I see
you outside a minute?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.300
Outside? Why?

08:43.300 --> 08:44.600
Well, because
I don't think

08:44.600 --> 08:46.300
he's really allowed
in the house.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.000
He, who?

08:52.200 --> 08:54.000
You stole the goat?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.100
I didn't steal him,
Rae, okay?

08:56.100 --> 08:57.400
I liberated him.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.700
Well, you need
to<i>unliberate </i>him.

08:59.700 --> 09:00.967
Rae, I can't.

09:00.967 --> 09:03.233
Okay, listen, I can't send him
back to a life

09:03.233 --> 09:05.100
of shame and humiliation,
you know,

09:05.100 --> 09:06.867
and really cheesy
halftime shows.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.200
I can't do it.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.867
Chels, you cannot keep him here.

09:09.867 --> 09:11.867
Rae, it's cool, 'cause
I got it all worked out.

09:11.867 --> 09:14.033
Look, all we have to do
is take him to a farm tonight.

09:14.033 --> 09:16.734
We? Why is the<i>me </i>always
included in the<i>we?</i>

09:16.734 --> 09:19.700
No, listen. The only thing
<i>we </i>are going to do

09:19.700 --> 09:21.200
is go to the concert.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.900
(<i>bleating </i>)

09:23.967 --> 09:25.400
Chelsea!

09:25.400 --> 09:27.500
I knew I'd find
that goat with you.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.967
What goat?

09:29.967 --> 09:31.100
Nice try, Chelsea.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.233
Give up the goat.

09:32.233 --> 09:33.567
No, no, no. Never.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.500
We are taking him
to a farm, okay?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.600
Chelsea, okay,
again with the<i>we?</i>

09:37.600 --> 09:38.934
But don't
you get it?

09:38.934 --> 09:40.233
If Gomez isn't at that game,

09:40.233 --> 09:42.033
there are going
to be some very large,

09:42.033 --> 09:44.033
very angry people
looking for me, Chels.

09:44.033 --> 09:45.500
Eddie, listen.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.834
Animals are living creatures,
okay?

09:47.834 --> 09:50.100
They deserve respect
and dignity.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.500
Absolutely. Now, what did you do
with his funny-looking hat?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.200
Come on, Gomez.
No! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

09:54.200 --> 09:56.000
(<i>both yelling </i>)

09:56.000 --> 09:57.200
Hey, people!

09:57.200 --> 09:58.900
People! People! People!

09:58.900 --> 10:02.133
This is ridiculous!

10:05.600 --> 10:08.600
It's just a goat!

10:08.600 --> 10:10.967
It's just a goat, okay?

10:10.967 --> 10:15.567
We need to remember what
is important right now.

10:15.567 --> 10:18.600
Boys In Motion.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.967
"Motion at Midnight."

10:20.967 --> 10:22.500
That is what is important, okay?

10:22.500 --> 10:23.667
So let's settle
this so Chelsea

10:23.667 --> 10:24.900
and I can put on our wristbands
and...

10:24.900 --> 10:26.400
Where's my wristbands at?

10:26.400 --> 10:27.834
They were in my pocket.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.467
Where's my pocket?

10:33.467 --> 10:35.300
Gomez?

10:35.300 --> 10:36.800
Gomez?

10:37.967 --> 10:40.500
Gomez, why?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.300
Okay, okay,
don't worry, dawg.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.567
Okay, Big D.,

10:48.567 --> 10:50.800
the goat's going
to be at the game.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.934

to do what to me?

that is physically impossible.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.400
You can make it work?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.567
Well, okay, man, all right.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.000
I'll see you at the game. Okay.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.367
Chelsea, I hope you're happy!

11:13.367 --> 11:15.767
Well, I'm generally
a happy person, I guess.

11:15.767 --> 11:17.900
I think it really
comes from within.

It's not a goat.

11:25.133 --> 11:26.834
It's Jaws in a fur coat.

Hey, Rae, please, okay,
not in front of the g-o-a-t.

11:29.700 --> 11:33.867
Why did he have to e-a-t
my wristbands?

11:33.867 --> 11:35.467
He a-t-e your wristbands?

11:35.467 --> 11:38.934
Yes, Mom, and now we
can't go to the concert.

11:38.934 --> 11:40.400
Well, don't give up yet.

Goats eat lots of things
that are not digestible,

11:42.767 --> 11:43.834

11:43.834 --> 11:44.900
must come out.

cough them up?

from the other end.

are waiting on you?

12:11.967 --> 12:15.767
Look, man, there's no sense
in us just sitting here

12:15.767 --> 12:17.200

something to happen.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.233
Now... y'all go ahead
and get some rest.

12:20.233 --> 12:21.834
I'll be a gentleman

Uh, uh, no.

I sit here and watch Gomez,

someplace really far

I turn my head,

snatch the goat.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.500
Well, you both snatched
the goat once already.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.967
Yeah, that's true.
Well, this is true.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.767
Well, if that's the case,

12:56.767 --> 12:57.900
I am not taking my eyes

that somebody just might
be better than you.

Okay, but I still
could have taken her

eat my joystick.

Hey, hey, hey, you guys, I just
got a report from the farm

21:13.000 --> 21:14.734
and you will be
very happy to know

21:14.734 --> 21:16.367
that Gomez
had a comfortable night

21:16.367 --> 21:18.000
and he is liked
and accepted

21:18.000 --> 21:19.200
by all his fellow goats.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.500
Chels, that is wonderful.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.700
I'm going to miss that
little beardy-chin,

21:22.700 --> 21:25.900
goaty-breath little thing.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.133
Hey, I'm glad the little
homie Gomez is chillin'.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.100
But I talked to the principal,
and he said,

21:30.100 --> 21:32.100
that since I was the one
that stole the goat,

21:32.100 --> 21:33.734
I got to come up
with a new mascot

21:33.734 --> 21:34.867
for Jefferson.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.500
Go, Jefferson!

21:43.500 --> 21:47.200
(<i>bleating </i>):
B-e-e-eat Bayside!

21:51.834 --> 21:53.600
Uh, Eddie--

21:53.600 --> 21:57.400
I got some baaad news.
