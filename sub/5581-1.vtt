01:10.080 --> 01:13.030
I think we're all here. I'm
looking forward to this.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.870
You should be at this board meeting.
You're a trustee and the patron.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.190
- Why are they coming here?
- I don't know exactly.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.670
I suppose they have something
they want to tell us.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.110
They obviously need more money.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.120
Right, we're off. See you later.

01:41.160 --> 01:44.310
Who's that? It's not one of
the farmers' wives, is it?

01:44.360 --> 01:46.030
No, I don't think so.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.950
Do you really like riding like that?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.150
When a side-saddle is
so much more graceful.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.630
And so much more dangerous.

01:52.680 --> 01:56.310
Is Mama right? You're dodging
the hospital meeting?

01:56.360 --> 01:59.040
Only a little bit.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.950
- May I be of assistance?
- No, thank you.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.030
Well, I expect you'll want to get started.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.350
- Started at what?
- Following the hunt.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.030
If you go with the others, they'll show
you where to watch them jump the brook.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.480
I see. Ta very much.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.950
- Can I lick the bowl?
- Yes.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.110
You can both lick the bowl.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.030
- I enjoyed that.
- Was it your first meet?

02:33.080 --> 02:35.150
There's not much hunting in Bayswater.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.990
Andy, go back and check
that everything's come down.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.740
- I think it has, Mrs Hughes.
- It never hurts to check.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.950
- He's a nice boy.
- He is.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.590
And I think I'm showing him
the right way to do things.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.350
I should let him find
his own way, Mr Barrow.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.310
Can I have a piggy-back?

02:51.360 --> 02:53.880
All right, then, but not for long.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.830
- I want to go hunting, too.
- All aboard.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.550
- And off we go!
- Faster! Faster!

03:02.600 --> 03:06.310
- Everything running smoothly?
- Oh, I suppose so.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.590
But it's harder with no
kitchen maid, you know.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.830
- Have you settled on a date yet?
- Date?

03:11.880 --> 03:14.150
Oh, you mean for the wedding?

03:16.160 --> 03:18.160
No, not yet.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.150
Oh, what are you doing up here?

03:52.200 --> 03:54.070
The button came off my cuff.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.120
I thought I'd mend it
before things got busy.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.270
- Shall we go down?
- Before we do...

04:01.520 --> 04:03.790
.. I wish you'd tell me what's wrong.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.040
Whatever makes you say that?

04:13.040 --> 04:16.149
- You'll say I'm being stupid.
- Well, maybe you are.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.200
Maybe.

04:20.440 --> 04:25.310
You see, when I accepted Mr Carson...

04:25.360 --> 04:28.870
- You didn't mean it?
- Oh, yes, I did.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.510
He's a very, very dear man.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.910
So, what's the problem?

04:33.960 --> 04:37.710
I hadn't fully considered...

04:37.760 --> 04:41.590
all the aspects of marriage.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.670
Of what I was getting into.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.190
I don't understand. What aspects?

04:46.240 --> 04:49.560
You know each other better
than most couples at the start.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.520
Oh, my Lord. You mean...?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.630
Yes.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.510
That is precisely what I mean.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.190
Well, there's nothing so
terrible about it, is there?

05:03.240 --> 05:05.950
So they say. I wouldn't know, of course.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.870
Mrs Patmore, look at me. I'm
a woman in late middle age...

05:09.920 --> 05:11.710
Oh, don't say 'late'.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.350
I was not bad-looking as a
girl, if you can believe it.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.590
- Very easily.
- But these days?

05:17.640 --> 05:21.640
I'm not sure I can let
him see me as I am now.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.110
Perhaps you can keep the lights off.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.870
That is not helpful, Mrs Patmore.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.510
Well, won't he feel the same?

05:30.560 --> 05:34.950
I mean, no-one's clapped eyes on
him without his togs for years.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.350
- Except the doctor.
- Good point. Very good point.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.270
Maybe he'd prefer us to leave
that side of things alone.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.270
Sorry? Live like brother
and sister, you mean?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.670
A very loving brother and sister.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.880
- And that's what you want?
- I don't know what I want.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.910
Except not to feel embarrassed and absurd.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.150
Is this why you've not fixed the date?

05:59.200 --> 06:02.390
I think we should be clear
about what we're doing.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.800
- Or not doing.
- Yes. Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.160
The trouble is, I don't believe it's
a conversation I can have with him...

06:14.320 --> 06:16.670
Oh, you're not suggesting I try?

06:16.720 --> 06:18.910
Oh, would you?

06:18.960 --> 06:20.880
Oh, by 'eck!

06:22.920 --> 06:25.510
I've had some commissions
in my time, but...

06:25.560 --> 06:28.230
It would be such a weight off my mind.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.790
Anna? Whatever's happened?

06:41.840 --> 06:44.430
Nothing. I'm starting a cold.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.480
I'd better get on.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.960
Are you all right?

07:36.880 --> 07:40.230
Of course. No bones broken, anyway.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.910
Thanks to nice Mr Fairclough here.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.350
Very kind of you, Fairclough.
Good to see you out.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.310
I never like to miss a day's
hunt when it's on my doorstep.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.030
- Shall I take you back to the
house, m'lady? - Certainly not.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.550
If you can just give me a hand up.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.470
I'm not taking any sort of 'tone'.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.600
I'm just reminding you of the deadline.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.480
Thank you. Goodbye.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.070
Trouble at the mill?

08:12.120 --> 08:14.430
My editor, Mr Skinner, again.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.110
- What's the problem?
- Everything's a problem.

08:17.160 --> 08:21.030
No, that's not quite true.
I think the problem is me.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.950
He doesn't like working for
a woman. Simple as that.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.430
I suppose you're right, not
selling up and taking the money.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.430
I think I am.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.309
Andrew, please ask Mrs
Hughes to organise tea for...

08:34.360 --> 08:38.390
- I'm not sure. Can you count them
as they arrive? - Very good, m'lady.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.990
- When did you learn about this?
- What do you mean?

08:41.039 --> 08:42.789
Well, you seem to have all the facts,

08:42.840 --> 08:44.910
when it's the first
time we've heard of it.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.830
What does that matter?

08:46.880 --> 08:50.510
The fact is that the Royal
Yorkshire County Hospital

08:50.560 --> 08:53.830
wants to take over our little hospital,

08:53.880 --> 08:56.230
which is outrageous.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.470
- But it's not as simple as that.
- Why not?

08:59.520 --> 09:01.910
Because there may be
benefits for the village.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.150
If we form such a partnership,
our patients would have access

09:05.200 --> 09:08.150
to more modern equipment,
to more advanced treatments.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.190
Our fundraising would be more efficient.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.150
And the price of the fundraising
would be to lose all control,

09:14.200 --> 09:18.270
and to become the tools of a
faceless committee in York.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.630
What matters more? Health or power?

09:20.680 --> 09:24.470
What matters is to have power over
the maintenance of our own health.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.670
- Ladies, ladies, please...
- Lady Grantham is right.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.630
Our independence is not
something we should just abandon

09:30.680 --> 09:33.230
without a second thought.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.670
- How did you find out about this?
- They wrote to me.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.670
Who did? I'm the hospital
Almoner. Nobody's written to me.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.230
Ever since you took that position,
you talk as if you run the place.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.870
I do run the place!

09:45.920 --> 09:48.830
Or, at least, I know every
detail of how it's run.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.550
And I ought to be told
about any proposed changes.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.830
- You're being told now.
- If you must know, it was a friend,

09:54.880 --> 09:57.950
on the board in York,
who whispered it to me.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.790
They'll write to all of us soon.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.950
So, you want to protect your power
at the expense of the patients.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.470
I want to protect the patients
at the expense of my power.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.960
And may the best man win.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.580
I'm glad we agree on this.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.680
Don't let's make too much of it.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.440
I'm fine.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.040
Good afternoon.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.070
I'm going in.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.350
I'm completely whacked.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
Don't tell your mother.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.670
Can you make sure he gets a
proper rub-down? He did well.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.720
Yes, m'lady.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.670
- Who are you?
- Rita Bevan.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.990
Don't you know me, Lady
Mary? Cos I know you.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.480
No. I do not know you.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.790
And I suppose you have forgotten

11:03.840 --> 11:05.870
the Grand Hotel in Liverpool, too, m'lady?

11:05.920 --> 11:08.230
And your nights there
with Viscount Gillingham?

11:08.280 --> 11:12.520
I was a chambermaid. But I suppose
we're invisible to people like you.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.670
This is all nonsense. You've no proof.

11:15.720 --> 11:18.510
Don't be silly. You
don't know what I've got.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.870
To start with, I've got
a page from the register.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.270
- Then you are a thief.
- Yes, I am a thief,

11:23.320 --> 11:26.550
and I want a thousand pounds
to keep my mouth shut.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.990
That's ridiculous.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.510
We'll see how ridiculous it is.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.120
I'm going now, but I'll be back.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.470
Don't bother. You're not the first
person who's tried to blackmail me.

11:38.520 --> 11:43.760
Well, I'm glad you know how it
works. And as I say, I will be back.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.690
- Penny for your thoughts.
- They're not worth as much.

11:53.740 --> 11:57.690
- They would be to me.
- Oh, I'm worn out. Give me some tea.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.690
You let those children run you ragged.

11:59.740 --> 12:02.650
Thank you. I've had Miss Marigold
on my back since luncheon.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.610
- How lucky is that child?
- Why do you say that?

12:05.660 --> 12:09.410
Well, what was she? A farmer's daughter.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.370
Until she caught the eye of Lady Edith.

12:11.420 --> 12:14.010
Now she'll grow up in the
bosom of a great family

12:14.060 --> 12:15.810
and live her life accordingly.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.760
I don't believe she has any
greater guarantee of happiness.

12:20.380 --> 12:22.980
That's Lady Mary, back from the hunt.

12:26.180 --> 12:29.610
I know you don't approve, but
it's quite ordinary in London now.

12:29.660 --> 12:32.660
- Will that be all, my Lord?
- Yes, thank you.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.010
At least... there is something.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.010
This is part of a larger conversation,

12:38.060 --> 12:40.050
but at some point we need to discuss

12:40.100 --> 12:42.530
future staffing requirements at Downton.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.650
We have cut down quite a bit, my Lord.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.210
We've only got one hall
boy and two housemaids,

12:47.260 --> 12:49.930
and as kitchen staff have
left, we've not replaced them.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.330
I know, and there's no
need for anything drastic.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.210
The estate's doing well, thanks
to Mr Crawley and Mr Branson,

12:55.260 --> 12:58.170
but I don't like to feel out
of step with my fellow man.

12:58.220 --> 13:00.010
As a matter of fact,

13:00.060 --> 13:02.530
both the housemaids have
handed in their notice.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.610
I was going to tell you.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.810
- Oh. Were they unhappy? I hope not.
- No, no, no.

13:07.860 --> 13:10.490
One is leaving to get married,
which we knew was coming,

13:10.540 --> 13:14.450
and Madge has found a job in a shop.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.810
Which is better than working here?

13:16.860 --> 13:21.050
She says that her young man wants
her to be free in the evenings.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.970
I must ask you to remember, my Lord,

13:24.020 --> 13:29.010
that there were six footmen when I
first came here and five housemaids.

13:29.060 --> 13:32.130
Now we've got to two of each
and no kitchen maids at all.

13:32.180 --> 13:35.010
We must run this place
as it should be run.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.930
I'm not asking you to wield a scythe,

13:36.980 --> 13:40.700
but, I mean, who has an
under-butler these days?

13:41.500 --> 13:44.580
If I could stop history in
its tracks, maybe I would.

13:45.460 --> 13:50.850
- But I can't, Carson. Nor you, nor I
can hold back time. - Unfortunately.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.730
The Dowager Countess has arrived, my Lord.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.780
Hmm.

13:58.260 --> 14:00.970
- She definitely waited on you?
- Well, she knows I was there

14:01.020 --> 14:02.570
with Lord Gillingham.

14:02.620 --> 14:05.330
- Are you going to pay her?
- A thousand pounds? Don't be mad.

14:05.380 --> 14:07.490
If I pay her, she'll only come back.

14:07.540 --> 14:10.730
- What will you do, then?
- Nothing, until I have to.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.730
Why should a paper print it, anyway?

14:12.780 --> 14:15.490
'Earl's daughter in love
tryst with married viscount'?

14:15.540 --> 14:17.730
He wasn't married then. Nor was I.

14:17.780 --> 14:19.610
It's still a good story.

14:19.660 --> 14:23.410
Anyway, what about YOUR
story? Is there any more news?

14:23.460 --> 14:26.450
You must still be on bail,
or else you'd have told me.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.890
We both are, in a way. At least,
I'm on bail and he's on tenterhooks,

14:30.940 --> 14:33.810
until they decide if they can
make a case against either of us.

14:33.860 --> 14:38.290
- What does Sergeant Willis say?
- Nothing, and Mr Willis isn't unkind.

14:38.340 --> 14:39.970
He'd have told us if it was over.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.810
- No wonder you're upset.
- Why do you say that?

14:42.860 --> 14:45.650
You just seemed a bit down in
the mouth, when you came in.

14:45.700 --> 14:51.210
- Never mind me. Now, what shall
we do about your hair? - Mm.

14:51.260 --> 14:53.130
You'll be very late going down.

14:53.180 --> 14:56.690
I wouldn't have washed it, but I
came off, and it was full of mud.

14:56.740 --> 14:59.210
You'll just have to do your best.

15:02.140 --> 15:04.970
- You're very quiet.
- I've got a lot on my mind.

15:05.020 --> 15:07.130
A problem shared is a problem halved.

15:07.180 --> 15:09.010
Huh! Or doubled.

15:09.060 --> 15:10.930
Ah, there you are.

15:10.980 --> 15:14.050
They're down, Mrs Patmore -- I'll
announce it when you're ready.

15:14.100 --> 15:17.490
No, I'm ready now. The first course
is cold, so it's already up there.

15:17.540 --> 15:22.530
- Very good. - Oh, could I have a
word? When you're done for the night.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.530
- May I know what about?
- I'll tell you then.

15:25.580 --> 15:28.060
It's nothing bad. At least...

15:28.740 --> 15:31.020
No, I'll tell you then.

15:31.860 --> 15:33.860
Hm.

15:37.300 --> 15:40.450
I don't think Mr Molesley meant
to be unkind about Miss Marigold.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.250
I'm sure he didn't.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.410
Only, it seemed to put
you in a strange mood.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.290
Did it?

15:46.340 --> 15:48.210
It's ironic.

15:48.260 --> 15:51.210
So many children in need of a home,

15:51.260 --> 15:53.860
and so many homes in need of a child.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.730
My God, what have I said?

16:00.900 --> 16:03.170
My darling, what have I said?

16:05.100 --> 16:07.100
It's not your fault.

16:08.180 --> 16:12.340
Only... I thought I was pregnant.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.010
And then, this morning...

16:17.300 --> 16:19.500
Well, anyway, now I'm not.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.330
You should have told me.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.920
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

16:25.060 --> 16:27.130
You weren't to know that would happen.

16:27.180 --> 16:29.180
But, you see, I was.

16:30.180 --> 16:32.780
Because it's happened before. Twice.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.540
I can't do it. I'm not able.

16:38.340 --> 16:40.480
There is no proof of that.

16:44.140 --> 16:45.970
But if you're not, you're not.

16:46.020 --> 16:48.020
We'll be all right.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.180
I've let you down.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.240
There are no words less true than those.

16:58.020 --> 17:00.220
You could never let me down.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.970
Besides, we've had so many troubles.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.849
There isn't a couple in the world

17:06.900 --> 17:09.569
who've had as many worries as we have.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.730
So, what did Tom have to say?

17:18.780 --> 17:21.849
He's found a flat with a garden
and Sybbie's happy at her school.

17:21.900 --> 17:25.089
- Speaking in an American accent.
- Would that be so awful?

17:25.140 --> 17:29.570
Poor Tom. If he was a fish out of
water here, what is he in Boston?

17:29.620 --> 17:31.450
A fish back in water, I'd have thought.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.650
There's a tremendous
Irish community there.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.410
If you ask me, he's landed on his feet.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.930
How is the search going
for his replacement?

17:38.980 --> 17:40.650
We've hardly started, really.

17:40.700 --> 17:43.450
We haven't started at all.
We don't need a replacement.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.490
- Why not?
- Because I'm his replacement.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.050
- I'm going to be the new agent.
- You're what?

17:49.100 --> 17:52.410
We've worked together since he came
back from Dublin. Why shouldn't I?

17:52.460 --> 17:55.570
- Quite right.
- Yes, but what about the heavy lifting?

17:55.620 --> 17:58.810
Granny, I think I can lift quite
as much as sad old Mr Jarvis,

17:58.860 --> 18:00.490
before Matthew chased him away.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.250
Brains count for more than muscles.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.090
Long live women's rights and all that,

18:04.140 --> 18:06.810
but it's not a good idea to
take on a job that wears you out.

18:06.860 --> 18:08.810
- I'm doing it now, aren't I?
- Yes.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.170
But you'll be dead by the
year's end at this rate.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.770
I suppose we only know what we're
capable of when we test our limits.

18:14.820 --> 18:17.170
And we certainly know
what you're capable of.

18:17.220 --> 18:19.010
What is that supposed to mean?

18:19.060 --> 18:20.970
Isobel, what's Granny done wrong?

18:21.020 --> 18:22.970
We're to have a fight about the hospital,

18:23.020 --> 18:25.250
and she began it by concealing the facts.

18:25.300 --> 18:29.930
- Oh, dear. - It seems to me we should --
- Cora, don't waste your time on it.

18:29.980 --> 18:32.330
It's a matter between
me and Cousin Isobel.

18:32.380 --> 18:35.730
We can't have the President in a
tug-of-war against the Almoner.

18:35.780 --> 18:37.530
We can if it's needed.

18:37.580 --> 18:40.120
With poor old Clarkson as the rope.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.170
Is now a good time?

18:48.220 --> 18:50.220
As good as any. Sit.

18:52.620 --> 18:55.210
- Some of this?
- No, thank you.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.210
Erm... well...

18:58.260 --> 19:02.050
The thing is, I've been speaking
to Mrs Hughes about your marriage.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.330
- Oh, yes?
- And I was wondering about...

19:05.380 --> 19:08.170
At least, we were both
discussing the terms

19:08.220 --> 19:10.610
on which you intend to live.

19:10.660 --> 19:13.050
Good terms, I hope...

19:13.100 --> 19:15.530
- Are you sure?
- Go on, then.

19:15.580 --> 19:19.330
You see, we were talking
of how it will be,

19:19.380 --> 19:23.050
sharing your life after
so many years on your own.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.660
That's the nub of it -- I agree.

19:26.260 --> 19:30.330
Because you've got used to
doing things in a certain way.

19:30.380 --> 19:31.890
It's true. I have.

19:31.940 --> 19:34.490
But I like to think that
I'm not too old to change.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.890
No, of course not.

19:36.940 --> 19:42.620
But do you expect to... to share your...

19:44.780 --> 19:48.370
- .. way of life?
- Doesn't everyone when they marry?

19:48.420 --> 19:50.290
I suppose.

19:50.340 --> 19:53.100
So, what can I do for you?

19:53.740 --> 19:55.530
Nothing.

19:55.580 --> 19:59.450
Oh... oh, it was very
nice, having a little chat.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.700
And thank you for the port.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.810
But I'll leave you to it now.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.580
Hmm.

20:12.340 --> 20:15.170
Are you plotting something?

20:15.220 --> 20:18.690
You sound like a governess
in fear of dismissal.

20:18.740 --> 20:21.890
You sound like a guilty party, who's
trying to throw me off the scent.

20:21.940 --> 20:25.770
Is something on your mind, Robert?
You seem a bit troubled lately.

20:25.820 --> 20:28.140
Do I? Well, maybe I am.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.770
To be honest, I'm starting to ask myself

20:30.820 --> 20:32.730
how much longer we can go on with it all.

20:32.780 --> 20:35.730
- Well, go on with what?
- The household. The servants.

20:35.780 --> 20:38.970
- You're not in
difficulties, are you? - No.

20:39.020 --> 20:43.570
But a butler, under-butler,
footmen, a valet, ladies' maids...

20:43.620 --> 20:46.930
to say nothing of the housemaids,
the kitchen, the laundry, the --

20:46.980 --> 20:50.010
Yes, well, you...

20:50.060 --> 20:53.170
you think it's a bit too much in 1925?

20:53.220 --> 20:57.570
The wage bill is three times
what it was before the war.

20:57.620 --> 21:01.930
Soon it will be worse. And anyway,
who lives as we used to, now?

21:01.980 --> 21:04.610
Well, I don't think you'll
see much change at the Palace.

21:04.660 --> 21:08.290
The Royal Family, then, the dukes,
some others, and good luck to them.

21:08.340 --> 21:10.690
But most people are cutting down.

21:10.740 --> 21:14.210
It seems hard that men and women
should lose their livelihoods

21:14.260 --> 21:16.130
because it's gone out of fashion.

21:16.180 --> 21:18.130
But what if they could find work?

21:18.180 --> 21:21.300
Well, how many do you see going?

21:22.660 --> 21:25.180
I don't know, but some.

21:31.660 --> 21:33.660
Granny was on form.

21:35.340 --> 21:37.570
I ought to go up to London soon.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.130
- Is this your editor?
- Partly him.

21:40.180 --> 21:41.970
I must get him back on track.

21:42.020 --> 21:44.850
But my tenant's also moving
out at the end of the month.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.580
- Out of Michael Gregson's flat?
- Out of MY flat.

21:49.900 --> 21:53.170
But, anyway, I'm not
quite sure what to do.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.250
Should I smarten it up
and let it out again?

21:55.300 --> 21:58.490
Or would it be good for me
to have my own London base?

21:58.540 --> 22:00.540
It's a thought.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.490
Anyway, I'm off to bed. Good night.

22:03.540 --> 22:05.540
Good night.

22:11.940 --> 22:15.490
Edith alone on the town.
What will she get up to?

22:15.540 --> 22:18.540
At her age, she's entitled
to get up to something.

22:20.220 --> 22:22.960
- What's the matter?
- Why do you ask?

22:23.740 --> 22:26.130
I... just worry about you.

22:26.180 --> 22:28.210
I'm your father. It's allowed.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.200
What makes you think
anything's the matter?

22:33.900 --> 22:36.490
How was dinner? Did you enjoy it?

22:36.540 --> 22:41.090
Quite. I'm afraid the times are
catching up with the Abbey, too,

22:41.140 --> 22:43.490
as they were bound to, I suppose.

22:43.540 --> 22:46.090
How do you mean, m'lady?

22:46.140 --> 22:48.740
Well, the way they run things there.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.880
They're not going to lay off staff?

22:52.620 --> 22:55.530
- Don't say anything.
- Oh, I'm a veritable tomb

22:55.580 --> 22:58.330
where other people's secrets
are concerned, m'lady.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.930
- It won't affect us.
- I hope not.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.810
Oh, no.

23:02.860 --> 23:05.610
We're down to the bare bones, as it is.

23:05.660 --> 23:09.250
You're right. Things are
positively frugal around here.

23:09.300 --> 23:13.130
I do worry about those who'll have to go.

23:13.180 --> 23:15.930
But remember, no talking.

23:15.980 --> 23:17.980
M'lady.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.670
- How did you get on last night?
- Oh...

23:32.720 --> 23:35.710
Er... Daisy, fetch that coconut ice.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.100
I'd like Mrs Hughes to try it.

23:40.080 --> 23:43.190
Not very well. I couldn't
seem to get to the subject.

23:43.240 --> 23:46.150
- Was he putting you off?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.350
But it was a difficult topic to arrive at.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.990
Erm... excuse me. I hope you can help me.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.230
I've got a message for
Lady Mary from the Dowager.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.910
She said it's urgent.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.350
If you give it to me, I'll
get someone to take it.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.590
Lady Grantham said I was to
put it into Lady Mary's hand.

24:01.640 --> 24:05.390
I'm sorry, Miss, but we don't know
you, and Lady Mary isn't down yet.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.310
I'm Ellen Gorse. I've just
started at the Dower House.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.870
I've only got to give her an envelope.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.520
Very well. I'll take you to her room.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.480
Yes?

24:23.560 --> 24:25.710
Sorry to bother you,
m'lady, but the Dowager

24:25.760 --> 24:28.390
has sent a message for you.
Apparently, it's urgent.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.790
- I doubt it.
- I haven't got it, m'lady.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.470
She sent a maid to put it into your hand.

24:34.520 --> 24:38.470
How mysterious. Well,
where is this Mercury maid?

24:38.520 --> 24:40.520
Here, m'lady.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.390
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.670
We mustn't delay you.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.750
Can you send Anna up?

24:49.800 --> 24:51.800
Of course, m'lady.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.580
- How dare you?
- I dare more than you dare.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.910
You could have asked her to
throw me out. Why didn't you?

25:01.960 --> 25:04.360
It would only make things worse.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.830
It'll be a lot worse when you're
sprawled over the centre pages

25:07.880 --> 25:09.990
of the News Of The World.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.040
You're revolting.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.590
Can't you see that none of
that stuff works with me?

25:15.640 --> 25:19.230
- What stuff?
- La-di-da, gracious great lady.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.830
You think you're so marvellous, don't you?

25:21.880 --> 25:25.630
Your lot's finished. You're
going down and we're coming up.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.430
The working classes may be coming up,

25:27.480 --> 25:29.190
but I'd be very surprised if you are.

25:29.240 --> 25:31.110
Now, please get out.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.830
- Can I have the money?
- No.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.270
You'd only come back for more.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.030
Suppose I gave you my word?

25:37.080 --> 25:39.590
If I wasn't so disgusted,
that would make me laugh.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.310
- I was just on my way up --
- This is Miss Bevan, whom I told you about.

25:43.360 --> 25:46.480
- How did you get in here?
- How do you think? I lied.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.910
Now, you've got one more chance,
and that'll be your last.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.270
You must be a glutton for punishment.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.790
Now, Anna, can you make sure she leaves?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.840
Certainly, m'lady.

26:18.920 --> 26:21.270
Mr Molesley's been on
at me about my exams.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.430
Ooh, I don't envy you. I still
cheer myself up by thinking,

26:24.480 --> 26:26.870
at least I don't have
to take any more exams.

26:26.920 --> 26:30.030
But he's right. I must take
them, or what's it all been for?

26:30.080 --> 26:34.030
Ooh, it doesn't look as if she'll
be staying on at the Dower House.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.950
No. I wouldn't have said she
was a long-term prospect.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.630
Not very congenial.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.420
'Ey, I wonder what was in that message.

26:43.320 --> 26:46.750
I suppose you're surprised to see
me lining up with the Dowager.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.470
Only because I think you're wrong.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.150
Well, you have a touching
faith in officialdom.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.870
Once they take over the hospital,

26:52.920 --> 26:56.190
they will lay down the law, with no
regard for the needs of this area.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.640
I've seen it in war and in
peace -- it's always the same.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.230
Do you not care?

27:03.280 --> 27:06.030
I'll tell you what I care
about. It's not complicated.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.390
I care about survival rates.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.310
Mrs Crawley, I'm sure you
don't intend to be offensive...

27:11.360 --> 27:13.670
No, but I intend to be
truthful. I'm the Almoner.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.910
I know the facts about
this place as well as you.

27:15.960 --> 27:19.550
So, this isn't something Lord
Merton has persuaded you into?

27:19.600 --> 27:21.750
- Lord Merton?
- You remember him, surely?

27:21.800 --> 27:24.740
That famous fount of
all medical knowledge.

27:25.720 --> 27:29.160
Well, I wish you luck
with your fellow warrior.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.830
What is it they say? Rather you than me.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.910
Good day.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.190
You've got a visitor. Sergeant Willis.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.830
- What does he want?
- Search me. He's in Mr Carson's room.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.020
Mr Bates is there already.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.430
But surely, if a woman's
confessed, that's the end of it?

27:52.480 --> 27:56.270
Not quite. Inspector Vyner thinks
it may be a false confession.

27:56.320 --> 27:59.190
You do get people coming forward
who had nothing to do with it.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.030
But haven't they checked her story?

28:01.080 --> 28:03.950
If she's one of his victims,
people must have seen her with him.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.350
That's the point. They
can't prove a connection.

28:06.400 --> 28:10.150
She says Mr Green picked her up in a
pub, but no-one can corroborate it.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.470
We can't send her to
prison if she's delusional.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.550
- Then why have you come here?
- Because it's your right to know

28:15.600 --> 28:17.230
that someone had confessed.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.510
How did she know Mr Green
would be in Piccadilly?

28:19.560 --> 28:23.470
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
She just saw him standing there.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.150
Did he speak to her,
like the witness said?

28:26.200 --> 28:30.280
He spoke. He belittled
her and he laughed at her.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.270
- And she pushed him.
- I believe she's telling the truth.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.880
And I'm certain it'll come
right. Just keep the faith.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.400
Good day.

28:45.720 --> 28:49.270
How stupid of him. To come here
before there was any proof.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.470
Don't be harsh. He meant well.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.720
Meaning well is not enough.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.510
A letter from Rose, to us all.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.110
- How does she sound?
- Hectic and happy.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.550
New York seems to suit her.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.710
M'lord, William Mason's
father is downstairs.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.430
Oh? What does he want?

29:08.480 --> 29:11.950
It seems the owners of the estate
where he's a tenant are selling up.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.390
- What? - The Darnleys
are selling Mallerton?

29:14.440 --> 29:16.110
I find that very hard to believe.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.910
So did he, my Lord, but now
there's to be an auction

29:18.960 --> 29:21.270
of the contents of the house on the tenth.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.870
You astonish me. But what can I do?

29:23.920 --> 29:27.430
He wonders if you could put in a
word for him to keep his tenancy.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.630
How does he know that's
not what they intend?

29:29.680 --> 29:32.670
- He's had a letter giving notice.
- Oh, it may be a formality.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.630
They have to sell with vacant possession,

29:34.680 --> 29:36.350
but the new owners may keep him on.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.230
He just wonders if you could
find out what his chances are.

29:39.280 --> 29:42.870
- Can't he ask them himself?
- You'd be more likely to get an answer.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.150
I hope it's not an impertinence.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.550
No. He was William's father.
He's Daisy's father-in-law.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.630
He enjoys privileges in this house.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.470
That's what I thought, my Lord.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.190
Well, I don't mind telephoning.
Is Mason in the servants' hall?

29:56.240 --> 29:59.030
Give him a drink, and I'll ring
down if I can make contact.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.080
Very good, my Lord.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.230
- So, what are you going to say?
- I've heard they're selling.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.310
I might know someone who's interested,

30:08.360 --> 30:10.030
but I thought I'd check first.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.230
Very ingenious. You would
have made a good courtier.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.680
I would not. Too much standing.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.350
Ah, Mrs Hughes...

30:20.400 --> 30:23.190
You don't think maybe you
should start calling me Elsie?

30:23.240 --> 30:25.710
Not here. Not while we're working.

30:26.600 --> 30:30.510
- Go on, then.
- I wish we could settle the date.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.700
There's no rush, is there?

30:39.400 --> 30:43.510
- Mr Mason. His Lordship's
ringing them now. - Thank you.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.710
But they can't just tell you to go.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.830
Not when you and your dad have
put in so many years there.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.190
They've given me notice, and I
shall have some compensation,

30:52.240 --> 30:54.990
but in the end, I'm
just a tenant, aren't I?

30:55.040 --> 30:57.990
- That's not how I see it.
- It doesn't matter how you see it.

30:58.040 --> 31:00.230
That's how it is.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.280
Hello!

31:03.800 --> 31:05.800
Ah, hello.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.150
Hello, Miss Denker.
What's your mission today?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.270
Not stirring any trouble up, I hope.

31:12.320 --> 31:16.630
- Me? Now, why would you say that?
- I can't imagine (!)

31:16.680 --> 31:20.070
- No, I've come here to sympathise.
- Sympathise? What with?

31:20.120 --> 31:23.950
News that the household here's
to be reduced. I am sorry.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.350
- What? Where did this come from?
- Oh, she never disappoints.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.990
I suppose that's me gone,
then. Last in, first out.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.350
You don't know that.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.910
I suppose it comes down to who's
useful and who's ornamental.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.790
Wouldn't you agree, Mr Barrow?

31:36.840 --> 31:38.710
If it's all right with you, Miss Denker,

31:38.760 --> 31:40.590
I'd rather talk to the organ-grinder.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.870
Oh, dear. I do hope I
haven't cast a shadow.

31:43.920 --> 31:47.510
What did you think you were
doing? Sprinkling sunshine?

31:47.560 --> 31:50.670
- By the way, when did that new
maid start? - What new maid?

31:50.720 --> 31:53.150
She came here with a
message from Her Ladyship.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.110
I haven't the first idea who that c... --

31:55.160 --> 31:57.160
Oh, that's the library.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.670
Mr Mason, you'd better come up with me.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.550
Andrew, what are you doing down here?

32:04.600 --> 32:08.190
- Mr Molesley thought we might need more milk.
- Well, get it, then.

32:08.240 --> 32:12.080
Mr Carson... did you know anything
about staff being laid off?

32:13.600 --> 32:16.790
It's not a subject for the here and now.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.910
Are you ready, Mr Mason?

32:21.920 --> 32:26.230
- Naturally, Sir John is very upset by it all.
- I should think he is.

32:26.280 --> 32:29.950
Unfortunately, they couldn't sell the
estate without vacant possession.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.230
- So, it's sold now?
- Yes. At least, they think so.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.270
- And I have to go.
- Not necessarily.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.430
That would be the
decision of the new owners.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.840
I see. Well...

32:41.560 --> 32:44.190
Thank you very much for
putting in a word, m'lord.

32:44.240 --> 32:47.670
If I hear anything more, I'll
make sure Daisy knows it.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.720
Thank you.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.190
Poor man.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.270
To have his whole future hanging
in the balance, at his time of life.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.190
These are days of uncertainty.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.360
- How was John when you spoke to him?
- In a state.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.950
They're throwing in the towel.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.230
He says, once the debts are paid,
there won't be too much left.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.630
Tim's emigrating to Kenya.

33:11.680 --> 33:15.310
Poor Marian. To be separated
from her only son.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.590
She'll hate that.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.430
- I said we'd go to the sale.
- Do you want to?

33:20.480 --> 33:23.110
Well, John's father and my
papa were as thick as thieves.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.870
It might be nice to find
a memento of the old boy.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.470
How was Granny?

33:28.520 --> 33:31.750
- Getting ready for a fight.
- Run to Mummy, Georgie.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.800
Hello, darling.

33:35.240 --> 33:38.950
I wish you'd stay out of it. Not
least because she's bound to win.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.590
Nobody ever stops her.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.640
What you mean is, no-one
has stopped her YET.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.510
- Can I help you, Miss Denker?
- No.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.790
I'm just tidying Her Ladyship's papers.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.070
She'll be down in a minute.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.190
- I'll tell Mrs Potter.
- Oh, how very reassuring.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.670
The butler giving the
cook an early warning.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.920
What are you talking about?

34:08.520 --> 34:11.909
- No. I don't want to worry you.
- Worry me with what?

34:11.960 --> 34:14.909
Oh, well, if you must know,

34:14.960 --> 34:18.150
there's going to be a shortening
of the wages bill around here.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.670
But why burden ourselves?

34:20.719 --> 34:23.230
What can we do? Que sera, sera.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.750
Are you trying to suggest, in
your usual, maladroit fashion,

34:26.800 --> 34:28.790
that our jobs are in peril?

34:28.840 --> 34:31.429
Well, I hate to sound smug, Mr Spratt,

34:31.480 --> 34:33.710
but I would suggest that Her Ladyship

34:33.760 --> 34:36.150
will always need to dress and undress.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.590
Ooh, while a butler is a luxury?
Is that what you're saying?

34:39.639 --> 34:42.150
My advice, Mr Spratt, is
to live for the moment.

34:42.199 --> 34:45.199
We none of us know what
the future will bring.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.630
Ah, I've put your spectacles
over there, m'lady.

34:49.679 --> 34:52.830
Thank you, Denker. Spratt, I'll
have dinner whenever it's ready.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.909
Would you tell Mrs Potter?

34:54.960 --> 34:58.440
I will, m'lady, although you
could have rung for her yourself.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.430
I beg your pardon?

35:01.480 --> 35:04.480
I was just thinking
aloud, m'lady. I'm sorry.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.260
I was... I was thinking aloud.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.070
Have you decided what to do
if that Miss Bevan returns?

35:16.120 --> 35:18.230
Not yet.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.590
If I pay her, I've a blood-sucking vampire

35:20.640 --> 35:22.670
on my back for the rest of my life.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.040
If I refuse, I'm ruined.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.920
What would you do?

35:29.760 --> 35:32.030
Don't be blackmailed, m'lady.

35:32.520 --> 35:35.280
I know it's easy to say, but don't.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.550
I think I agree. If I'm strong enough.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.990
Either way, my life's up the spout,

35:42.040 --> 35:44.430
and though I hate the idea of scandal,

35:44.480 --> 35:47.280
somehow the shadow of blackmail is worse.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.590
The cheek of her.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.590
It was all I could do
not to give her a slap.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.740
- Will there be anything else?
- No. Thank you.

35:59.520 --> 36:04.200
We may have our problems, the both
of us, but we'll get through them.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.250
- Could you spare me a minute?
- If you like.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.850
Come along to my pantry.

36:19.900 --> 36:22.770
I have a feeling that we
never quite got to the reason

36:22.820 --> 36:24.610
for your visit last night.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.770
No. That's correct.

36:26.820 --> 36:29.740
Only, I'm asking myself...

36:31.180 --> 36:33.770
Were you a messenger from Mrs Hughes?

36:33.820 --> 36:35.890
You could say that, yes.

36:36.460 --> 36:39.250
You were on a mission for her?

36:39.300 --> 36:41.300
Yes. It's true.

36:42.820 --> 36:48.770
Mrs Patmore, did she ask you to
tell me she's changed her mind?

36:48.820 --> 36:51.170
What? No!

36:51.220 --> 36:53.410
Well, not exactly.

36:53.460 --> 36:55.690
I'm waiting.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.690
Well, that is all very fine,

36:57.740 --> 37:00.810
but it's hard for me to
talk about such things.

37:00.860 --> 37:03.200
Now I'm on the edge of my seat.

37:03.940 --> 37:06.880
Oh, it's no good. I
shall have to look away.

37:08.020 --> 37:12.810
You see, she is a very
proud woman, Mr Carson.

37:12.860 --> 37:15.250
I know that, and I respect her for it.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.370
And she would never want to
appear ridiculous in your eyes.

37:18.420 --> 37:21.130
- Nor could she.
- No, but...

37:21.180 --> 37:24.050
as your wife, she wonders

37:24.100 --> 37:26.100
if you would expect...

37:28.380 --> 37:31.260
(.. that she perform her wifely duties.)

37:32.140 --> 37:35.130
Don't wives normally perform their duties?

37:35.180 --> 37:37.180
Good wives, any...

37:41.420 --> 37:45.490
- Oh. - Yes. That's it.
I think we've got there.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.530
I do believe we have.

37:47.580 --> 37:51.210
She needs to know if
that's what you anticipate.

37:51.260 --> 37:53.210
A full marriage.

37:53.260 --> 37:55.260
As opposed to...?

37:55.700 --> 37:58.650
Living together in
companionship, I suppose.

37:58.700 --> 38:01.500
In friendship. Warm friendship, I'm sure.

38:02.260 --> 38:07.010
Is that what she's
offering? Warm friendship?

38:07.060 --> 38:10.140
She has to know what you expect.

38:16.660 --> 38:20.730
Ever think of a time when we're told
the whole Mr Green business is over?

38:20.780 --> 38:26.540
- Of course I do. - We could start
to plan again, revive our dreams.

38:27.580 --> 38:30.980
You mean your old dream of
a house full of children?

38:32.980 --> 38:34.930
I'm sorry.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.820
That's the end of the self-pity. I swear.

38:38.980 --> 38:43.290
If they'll just leave us alone,
I'll be happy, whatever comes.

38:43.340 --> 38:45.170
No, you won't.

38:45.220 --> 38:48.220
At least, not as happy
as you could have been.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.040
But it's nice of you to say it.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.940
Well...

38:56.420 --> 38:59.130
That was an awkward mission
for you, if you like.

38:59.180 --> 39:00.970
Oh, I'll say.

39:01.020 --> 39:04.020
I'm sorry if you're
embarrassed, because I am.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.330
I'm not embarrassed, exactly.

39:06.380 --> 39:09.450
I do not believe that embarrassment
has much of a part to play

39:09.500 --> 39:12.780
when something is as important as this.

39:14.900 --> 39:17.040
But what am I to tell her?

39:17.620 --> 39:20.130
Tell her this, Mrs Patmore.

39:20.180 --> 39:22.860
That, in my eyes, she is beautiful.

39:23.260 --> 39:25.250
I see.

39:25.300 --> 39:30.010
You say she asks if I
want a 'full' marriage...

39:30.060 --> 39:34.140
and the answer is... yes, I do.

39:34.740 --> 39:38.410
I want a real marriage, a true marriage,

39:38.460 --> 39:41.460
with everything that that involves...

39:42.500 --> 39:45.650
.. and I hope I do not ask the indelicate

39:45.700 --> 39:48.770
when I send you back
to relay this message.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.820
Don't worry about me.

39:54.420 --> 39:56.660
I love her, Mrs Patmore.

39:57.860 --> 40:01.010
I am happy and tickled and...

40:01.060 --> 40:04.290
bursting with pride

40:04.340 --> 40:06.940
that she would agree to be my wife.

40:07.900 --> 40:11.690
And I want us to live as
closely as two people can,

40:11.740 --> 40:14.540
for the time that remains to us on earth.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.370
Well, you couldn't make it any clearer.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.420
I'll say that for you.

40:21.740 --> 40:24.340
And if she feels that she must...

40:25.660 --> 40:27.660
.. withdraw...

40:29.860 --> 40:31.860
.. so be it.

40:32.540 --> 40:38.220
But I could never have lived
some... pat-a-cake friendship lie.

40:39.420 --> 40:41.980
No. I didn't think you would.

40:43.820 --> 40:47.450
And for what it's worth, I wish
you the best of luck, Mr Carson.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.500
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

40:54.900 --> 40:57.100
That is worth a great deal.

41:04.780 --> 41:07.320
I'm sorry to disturb Your Ladyship.

41:07.820 --> 41:09.890
Yes, Spratt. What is it?

41:10.460 --> 41:14.220
I just hope you will be kind enough
to give me sufficient warning.

41:16.380 --> 41:18.370
I'm sorry, what?

41:18.420 --> 41:22.210
So I may find myself alternative
employment, before I am cast out.

41:22.260 --> 41:23.970
Oh, Spratt...

41:24.020 --> 41:28.290
You have clearly had a bad dream
and are confusing it with reality.

41:28.340 --> 41:30.890
Your Ladyship's humour is always a tonic,

41:30.940 --> 41:33.530
but it is a matter of
some importance to me.

41:33.580 --> 41:37.010
If you were talking in Urdu, I
couldn't understand you less.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.970
Miss Denker has broken the news

41:39.020 --> 41:43.170
that the households, here and
at the Abbey, are to be reduced.

41:43.220 --> 41:45.410
- Has she?
- I do not see how you could manage

41:45.460 --> 41:48.610
without a cook, a
housemaid or Miss Denker,

41:48.660 --> 41:51.570
which leaves me as the
only candidate for removal.

41:51.620 --> 41:55.210
Well, I believe many people live
without butlers. So I'm told.

41:55.260 --> 42:00.090
Exactly. And all I ask is some
warning when my time is up.

42:00.140 --> 42:03.130
Well, leave this to me,
Spratt. I will attend to it.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.180
Your Ladyship.

42:14.260 --> 42:16.330
So, can I go to the auction tomorrow?

42:16.380 --> 42:19.810
Well, why does Mr Mason want to go,
himself? Won't it make him sad?

42:19.860 --> 42:23.210
I think he's quite nostalgic.
He's known the family all his life.

42:23.260 --> 42:26.210
- But it's bound to be upsetting.
- Which is why I want to help.

42:26.260 --> 42:29.330
- Oh, I see that.
- And the new owners will be there.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.090
Of course they will. They'll
want to buy a lot of stuff,

42:32.140 --> 42:34.170
to make it convincing when they take over.

42:34.220 --> 42:37.010
We'll be back in time for tea,
so I can do my work for dinner.

42:37.060 --> 42:39.290
- But how will you get there?
- I've asked Mr Stark

42:39.340 --> 42:41.650
if I can ride in the
front of one of the cars.

42:41.700 --> 42:44.690
Well, you've got a nerve!
Mr Carson won't like that.

42:44.740 --> 42:47.770
Even Mr Carson can't
always have it his own way.

42:47.820 --> 42:51.450
- Ooh... - Lady Mary's out, miss, and
I don't know when she'll be back.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.490
Who shall I say has called?

42:53.540 --> 42:55.810
- I'll wait.
- Er...

42:55.860 --> 42:58.530
Lady Mary could be hours, so
there's no point in waiting.

42:58.580 --> 43:00.690
- I will, all the same.
- Thank you, Mr Molesley.

43:00.740 --> 43:02.850
I'll deal with this.

43:02.900 --> 43:06.010
I have no desire to be rude, miss,
but if you wish to see Lady Mary,

43:06.060 --> 43:07.930
I suggest you make an appointment.

43:07.980 --> 43:09.570
What's going on? Carson?

43:09.620 --> 43:14.050
Nothing to concern you, my Lord.
This young lady is leaving.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.410
On the contrary -- it will
concern you quite a lot,

43:16.460 --> 43:19.260
cos I've waited for Lady Mary long enough.

43:27.900 --> 43:30.300
Oh, my dear, how exotic.

43:31.220 --> 43:33.530
I expect to find the whole
of the Bloomsbury Set

43:33.580 --> 43:35.410
curled up in a corner with a book.

43:35.460 --> 43:37.690
Michael knew quite a
few of them, actually.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.370
I met Virginia Woolf in this
room, and Lytton Strachey,

43:40.420 --> 43:42.170
although he didn't stay long.

43:42.220 --> 43:44.010
I wish I'd known your Mr Gregson.

43:44.060 --> 43:46.650
We smiled at each other and
spoke about the weather,

43:46.700 --> 43:49.330
but we never really talked.

43:49.380 --> 43:52.530
Sometimes I feel I've been given
one little bit of happiness,

43:52.580 --> 43:54.570
and that will have to do.

43:54.620 --> 43:56.690
From now on, my life
will be all of a pattern.

43:56.740 --> 43:59.700
Nonsense. You have Marigold.

44:00.380 --> 44:02.380
That's true.

44:02.580 --> 44:04.530
So, what do you think I should do?

44:04.580 --> 44:08.090
- Would you like a London life?
- The fact is, I'd like a life.

44:08.140 --> 44:10.090
Well, I won't speak against London,

44:10.140 --> 44:14.370
but remember, I had no children
to make a country life sensible.

44:14.420 --> 44:17.050
Whereas I have a child
I can't acknowledge.

44:17.100 --> 44:19.490
People aren't so curious in London.

44:19.540 --> 44:21.690
No. They couldn't care less.

44:21.740 --> 44:23.810
Isn't that a relief?

44:23.860 --> 44:27.530
And then there's the museums
and galleries and theatre.

44:27.580 --> 44:29.730
People always talk of such things,

44:29.780 --> 44:33.340
but one only ever goes
when friends come to stay.

44:34.220 --> 44:37.570
- When's your train?
- You're right. We should go.

44:37.620 --> 44:41.060
But the question remains.
What is your future?

44:41.540 --> 44:44.370
Hanging around Downton,
being sniped at by Mary?

44:44.420 --> 44:48.410
Charity work? Travelling?
Publishing? What?

44:48.460 --> 44:51.200
Well, that's the problem. I don't know.

44:51.580 --> 44:53.580
I just don't know.

45:01.060 --> 45:04.530
- I've been watching out for you.
- Why? What is it?

45:04.580 --> 45:08.410
A young woman of most unappealing
aspect has been asking for you.

45:08.460 --> 45:10.690
- Was her name Bevan?
- I knew she was trouble.

45:10.740 --> 45:13.770
She may cause trouble for me, but
only because I've been foolish.

45:13.820 --> 45:16.210
Oh, we can all be foolish, My Lady.

45:16.260 --> 45:19.330
You know, Carson, some day
there'll be something I've done

45:19.380 --> 45:21.290
that even you will condemn me for.

45:21.340 --> 45:24.650
- I doubt that very much.
- Did she say if she'll be back?

45:24.700 --> 45:26.930
She never left. I tried
to get her to go, but --

45:26.980 --> 45:30.680
- Where is she now?
- In the library, with His Lordship.

45:37.060 --> 45:40.290
- Papa, I don't know what this person
has told you... - Only the truth.

45:40.340 --> 45:44.330
.. but I hope you're not giving
her any money. Not on my account.

45:44.380 --> 45:47.820
Take it and go. And remember, one word...

45:49.940 --> 45:52.050
Aren't you the lucky one?

45:52.100 --> 45:54.570
But then I suppose you always are.

46:00.980 --> 46:03.500
- What did she say?
- Enough.

46:09.740 --> 46:12.650
I find I'm most disappointed
in Tony Gillingham.

46:12.700 --> 46:14.650
Don't be.

46:14.700 --> 46:17.210
He wanted us to get married.

46:17.260 --> 46:21.420
Our week in sin was just part
of his plan to persuade me.

46:23.260 --> 46:25.130
Then why did you say no?

46:25.180 --> 46:28.210
Because, when it came
to it, he wasn't right.

46:28.260 --> 46:30.290
At least, not for me.

46:30.340 --> 46:33.090
And you didn't think of George?

46:33.140 --> 46:35.850
Of course I did. I thought of all of you.

46:35.900 --> 46:37.970
I just needed to be sure.

46:40.100 --> 46:42.370
I suppose you were a widow, after all,

46:42.420 --> 46:44.290
and not a deb in her first season.

46:44.340 --> 46:47.090
But it's still not the way your
parents would have behaved.

46:47.140 --> 46:48.730
Oh, I don't know...

46:48.780 --> 46:51.570
If you believe what they
write about the Edwardians.

46:51.620 --> 46:53.810
What were you planning
to do with Miss Bevan?

46:53.860 --> 46:56.930
I wasn't going to be
blackmailed -- I know that.

46:56.980 --> 47:01.010
So I suppose I'd have let
her publish and be damned.

47:01.060 --> 47:03.400
Rather tough on Tony and Mabel.

47:05.620 --> 47:08.610
Anyway, I'll telephone
the bank in the morning

47:08.660 --> 47:10.970
and return your thousand pounds.

47:11.020 --> 47:16.090
I gave her 50 pounds, and here's
her signed confession to blackmail.

47:16.140 --> 47:18.050
How did you manage that?

47:18.100 --> 47:21.330
I told her she could either have
50 pounds, on condition of signing,

47:21.380 --> 47:24.820
or leave with nothing and
be reported to the police.

47:25.460 --> 47:28.290
But... how do you know she won't be back?

47:28.340 --> 47:31.850
I said, if anything were published
or if we ever see her face again,

47:31.900 --> 47:34.440
I'd use it and she'd be prosecuted.

47:34.740 --> 47:36.890
I'm impressed.

47:36.940 --> 47:41.210
My darling Papa transformed
into Machiavelli at a touch.

47:41.260 --> 47:43.170
Will wonders never cease?

47:43.220 --> 47:45.220
Is that a compliment?

47:45.780 --> 47:49.810
You're still out of pocket,
50 quid. I must repay it.

47:49.860 --> 47:53.250
No need. It was money well spent.

47:53.300 --> 47:55.730
- Why?
- To learn that my eldest child

47:55.780 --> 47:59.890
is a child no more and quite
tough enough to run this estate.

47:59.940 --> 48:02.250
Indeed, she could clearly run the kingdom,

48:02.300 --> 48:04.840
should she be called upon to do so.

48:05.540 --> 48:07.690
Well, I hope you mean that.

48:07.740 --> 48:09.490
I do.

48:09.540 --> 48:13.330
And I'm more interested than
ever to see who, in the future,

48:13.380 --> 48:16.890
does come up to your exacting standards.

48:16.940 --> 48:18.770
Maybe no-one.

48:18.820 --> 48:22.530
I'd rather be alone
than with the wrong man.

48:22.580 --> 48:25.610
Who was that young woman I saw leaving?

48:25.660 --> 48:27.410
Someone after money. Usual thing.

48:27.460 --> 48:29.890
- Did you give her any?
- Some.

48:29.940 --> 48:32.370
It was quite a good cause.

48:32.420 --> 48:36.130
- Has Edith telephoned?
- Yes. She'll be home for dinner.

48:36.180 --> 48:38.690
I wonder if she wants to
come to Mallerton tomorrow.

48:38.740 --> 48:41.970
Maybe we should all go. The
Fall Of The House Of Usher.

48:42.020 --> 48:44.420
We mustn't crow. We may be next.

48:50.600 --> 48:54.680
Daisy! Get upstairs. You don't
want to keep them waiting.

48:57.960 --> 49:01.230
I keep thinking of what you told me.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.830
- About what Mr Carson said.
- I should think so. So do I.

49:04.880 --> 49:06.870
I'm sorry I put you through that.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.460
It was difficult, I'll not deny it.

49:10.720 --> 49:13.990
You think I should accept
his terms and set the date?

49:14.040 --> 49:16.510
Oh, no, no. That's your decision.

49:16.560 --> 49:20.240
I can only say he was very
moving when he spoke of you.

49:20.960 --> 49:23.190
He avoided... vulgarity, then?

49:23.240 --> 49:25.550
Vulgarity?

49:25.600 --> 49:29.030
Mr Carson wouldn't be vulgar if
they put him on a seaside postcard.

49:29.080 --> 49:33.110
I'd like to feel a man could
speak of me like that at my age.

49:33.160 --> 49:35.200
I would.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.720
Now, I must get on.

49:45.760 --> 49:48.910
We must get going if we're to
look round before it starts.

49:48.960 --> 49:50.710
So, it's farewell to Mallerton.

49:50.760 --> 49:53.990
Why? Are you planning to turn
up your nose at the new owners?

49:54.040 --> 49:56.470
No. I just don't think
I'll be in Yorkshire

49:56.520 --> 49:58.670
quite so much in the future.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.710
What a funny thing to say.

50:00.760 --> 50:02.750
It's time to go forward,

50:02.800 --> 50:05.030
and I'm unmarried, so I must do it alone.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.070
That sounds rather severe.

50:07.120 --> 50:09.630
I think it sounds very positive.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.990
Thank you, Baxter.

50:12.040 --> 50:14.950
Mr Carson, when you said we'd
know if there was a plan --

50:15.000 --> 50:17.880
Excuse me, while I see them off.

50:20.360 --> 50:23.470
Well, he doesn't seem that
bothered, so it can't be that bad.

50:23.520 --> 50:25.630
You and I both know that the worse it is,

50:25.680 --> 50:27.710
the less he'll want to seem bothered.

50:27.760 --> 50:30.310
Besides, they all want
to be rid of me anyway.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.590
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.270
You've seen how they warn
Andy to keep away from me.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.310
We got on very well when he first arrived,

50:37.360 --> 50:39.190
but now he hardly dares to talk to me.

50:39.240 --> 50:41.110
I think this is all in your head.

50:41.160 --> 50:43.000
No, it's not.

50:56.640 --> 50:59.030
Oh, good. You're here.

50:59.080 --> 51:00.910
I just took a chance.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.670
I thought you might be at
the auction with the others.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.710
I don't like auctions,

51:05.760 --> 51:08.390
especially when I knew
the house in the old days.

51:08.440 --> 51:12.510
I hate to see people's
things piled up in a heap.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.310
Like so much rubbish.

51:14.360 --> 51:17.510
Well, you and I differ when it
comes to the importance of things.

51:17.560 --> 51:20.870
Does it ever get cold on
the moral high ground (?)

51:20.920 --> 51:23.510
I wanted to come because I
don't want us to fall out

51:23.560 --> 51:25.470
over the hospital.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.550
I need to be sure that we can disagree,

51:27.600 --> 51:30.390
without there being any
bad feeling between us.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.990
- Well, it depends who wins.
- Surely not!

51:33.040 --> 51:35.670
Which means you are confident of victory.

51:35.720 --> 51:37.510
Well, we shall see.

51:37.560 --> 51:39.550
Shall I ring for some tea?

51:39.600 --> 51:43.160
It's rather early, but
I think we deserve it.

51:43.920 --> 51:48.190
I remember Mallerton in the 1860s.

51:48.240 --> 51:50.230
Dear old Lady Darnley.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.790
Always liked to stuff
the place with royalty.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.830
She was addicted to curtseying!

51:54.880 --> 51:56.790
How we laughed.

51:56.840 --> 51:58.750
It's sad to think about it.

51:58.800 --> 52:01.950
- Ah, Spratt. Could we have some tea?
- Your Ladyship.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.510
It seemed a little chilly, m'lady,
so I've brought you a shawl.

52:05.560 --> 52:07.750
- Oh, you are a wonder, Denker.
- Thank you.

52:07.800 --> 52:11.750
- I shall miss you.
- M'lady?

52:11.800 --> 52:13.830
Oh, I'm sorry. No, forget I said that.

52:13.880 --> 52:16.390
After all, nothing is settled.

52:16.440 --> 52:18.990
What's not settled?

52:19.040 --> 52:20.750
I don't understand.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.230
I thought you told Spratt
about the staff being cut

52:23.280 --> 52:25.110
back here and at the Abbey.

52:25.160 --> 52:28.390
Well, I... may have mentioned it.

52:28.440 --> 52:31.350
Oh, well. As I said, nothing's decided.

52:31.400 --> 52:34.150
But Your Ladyship couldn't
manage without a maid.

52:34.200 --> 52:36.550
Mrs Crawley does. Don't you?

52:36.600 --> 52:38.910
Indeed I do,

52:38.960 --> 52:41.390
but I don't wish to upset poor Denker.

52:41.440 --> 52:44.790
But Mrs Crawley also manages
without a butler, m'lady.

52:44.840 --> 52:46.710
That is true,

52:46.760 --> 52:50.270
but I don't think I could break
with tradition to quite that degree.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.750
Shall we have some tea?

52:52.800 --> 52:54.790
Your Ladyship.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.840
Miss Denker?

53:00.160 --> 53:02.390
Don't worry, Miss Denker.

53:02.440 --> 53:05.040
I've got a copy of The Lady upstairs.

53:07.600 --> 53:10.470
You don't really mean to manage
without a lady's maid, do you?

53:10.520 --> 53:13.190
Certainly not!

53:13.240 --> 53:16.600
- Then why did you --
- Sometimes it's good to rule by fear.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.270
I can hardly believe it.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.350
I used to come here all the time as a boy.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.710
Sic transit gloria mundi.

53:50.760 --> 53:53.960
Will you be as philosophical
when it's our turn?

54:20.960 --> 54:23.710
Crikey. They're selling everything.

54:23.760 --> 54:26.350
This is John's grandmother,
for God's sake.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.470
They must think it's too large.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.510
Too large for London.

54:30.560 --> 54:33.430
Dear John. We're so sorry.

54:33.480 --> 54:35.470
At least I hope it's what you want.

54:35.520 --> 54:38.030
But it isn't. Not at all.

54:38.080 --> 54:40.070
You're having quite a clean sweep.

54:40.120 --> 54:43.750
We've kept a few portraits to make
a decent show in the London house,

54:43.800 --> 54:46.030
but what's the point of storing the rest?

54:46.080 --> 54:49.070
This life is over for
us. It won't come back.

54:49.120 --> 54:52.030
I admire you. Too many people
just hang on and hang on,

54:52.080 --> 54:54.870
instead of facing things
as they really are.

54:54.920 --> 54:57.710
But we did hang on, I'm afraid.
We hung on for far too long.

54:57.760 --> 54:59.590
And now there's nothing left.

54:59.640 --> 55:01.640
Learn from us.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.670
Ah, there are the Hendersons.

55:09.520 --> 55:12.750
Is there anything you'd like
to buy, or are we just looking?

55:12.800 --> 55:15.270
I wanted to see the house
as much as anything.

55:15.320 --> 55:18.230
I know this hall from
Christmas parties and the like,

55:18.280 --> 55:20.880
but er... I've a mind to poke around.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.230
That were a wedding present
when Sir John got married.

55:24.280 --> 55:27.910
A gift from the tenants. I
contributed half a crown to it.

55:27.960 --> 55:30.670
Had no beer for a week.
Shame to see it sold.

55:30.720 --> 55:32.710
I don't think it's right.

55:32.760 --> 55:36.030
That was for Best of
Breed at the county fair.

55:36.080 --> 55:38.070
Won by a Holstein milker.

55:38.120 --> 55:41.750
My dad tended the Holsteins
before he took over our farm.

55:41.800 --> 55:44.830
It's as if they were selling
your past along with their own.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.670
That's them.

55:46.720 --> 55:49.310
That's the new owners. Mr
and Mrs Philip Henderson.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.710
The ones who won't guarantee
that you can stay on?

55:51.760 --> 55:54.470
- Hey, Daisy. There's no need to --
- I'm not having it. - Daisy!

55:54.520 --> 55:57.270
- It won't do any good.
- I have to say something!

55:57.320 --> 55:59.110
It's not fair!

55:59.160 --> 56:01.160
Who is this person?

56:01.920 --> 56:05.030
She's the daughter-in-law of
one of our tenant farmers.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.590
Excuse me, but are you the new owner?

56:07.640 --> 56:10.070
- I am. - So it's you who
insists on serving notice to men

56:10.120 --> 56:12.190
who've given their whole life to the land?

56:12.240 --> 56:15.390
- Daisy! - You boot out families
who've been here for generations.

56:15.440 --> 56:18.390
- What gives you the right to do that?
- Mrs Mason, there's really no --

56:18.440 --> 56:20.190
I don't think you're the man to tell me.

56:20.240 --> 56:22.790
Pull yourself together. What
do you think you're doing?

56:22.840 --> 56:24.630
A man who sells his wedding presents?

56:24.680 --> 56:28.390
Do you know what it meant for
a farmer to give half a crown?

56:28.440 --> 56:30.870
- Or don't you care?
- Daisy, stop this at once!

56:30.920 --> 56:32.910
I'm sorry, m'lord, but no.

56:32.960 --> 56:35.710
Mr Mason has given his
whole life to this farm,

56:35.760 --> 56:38.190
like his father and
grandfather before him,

56:38.240 --> 56:40.230
but where's the gratitude?

56:40.280 --> 56:42.630
Mr Henderson, I'm sure she
doesn't mean to be rude.

56:42.680 --> 56:45.350
You can't imagine that if I do
keep on some of the tenants,

56:45.400 --> 56:47.470
her father-in-law would now be among them?

56:47.520 --> 56:50.070
Now, please don't be hasty.
She's upset for old Mason --

56:50.120 --> 56:52.830
I'm sorry, Darnley. I don't
find this sort of thing amusing.

56:52.880 --> 56:56.030
Good day, Mrs Mason. You
have not helped your cause.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.390
- I'm speaking for myself, not --
- Good day, Mrs Mason.

56:58.440 --> 57:01.150
Now, will you excuse me?
The auction's starting.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.830
- I'm sure she didn't mean any
- Oh, God. What have I done?

57:03.880 --> 57:05.550
I daresay he'll cool off.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.800
I wouldn't put money on it.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.620
We should find our chairs.

57:17.040 --> 57:21.110
Good afternoon, lords,
ladies and gentlemen.

57:21.160 --> 57:24.350
The first lot consists of
a set of sporting prints

57:24.400 --> 57:27.710
from the mid-19th century. Who
would like to start the bidding?

57:27.760 --> 57:30.190
Two pounds, anyone? Two
pounds to start with.

57:30.240 --> 57:32.110
We're selling things we shouldn't have.

57:32.160 --> 57:35.110
But I kept thinking of that poky
little house in Thurloe Square

57:35.160 --> 57:38.150
- and I couldn't see what else to do.
- You might have stored some of it,

57:38.200 --> 57:40.910
in case one of the children
starts up another house one day.

57:40.960 --> 57:43.030
That's a dream. Face it.

57:44.400 --> 57:47.750
In 20 years' time, there won't be
a house of this size still standing

57:47.800 --> 57:49.630
that isn't an institution.

57:49.680 --> 57:52.720
One pound, seventeen and six. And sold!

57:57.960 --> 57:59.630
That's it.

57:59.680 --> 58:02.710
They're in the drawing room,
they've got coffee and we're done.

58:02.760 --> 58:04.510
- How was your day?
- Not very good.

58:04.560 --> 58:07.790
I'm sure it's not as bad as you
say. Mr Henderson will understand.

58:07.840 --> 58:10.710
No, he won't. I went to help
and I've made things worse.

58:10.760 --> 58:13.590
- This was in front of His Lordship?
- In front of all of them.

58:13.640 --> 58:16.030
- Could prove awkward!
- Thank you, Thomas (!)

58:16.080 --> 58:19.110
If they dismiss me, I've got
no-one but myself to blame.

58:19.160 --> 58:22.550
- It won't come to that, Daisy.
- What will happen to Mr Mason now?

58:22.600 --> 58:25.390
What can he do? Try to find
another farm to take on as tenant,

58:25.440 --> 58:28.630
- but who'll let him at his age?
- It's a good life, though, isn't it?

58:28.680 --> 58:30.390
Are you turning into a country boy?

58:30.440 --> 58:32.230
You'll have to let me show you around.

58:32.280 --> 58:35.630
Andy can find his own way round.
He looks sharp enough to me.

58:35.680 --> 58:37.630
No, no. Come in, come in.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.440
They're here, or they were a minute ago.

58:41.760 --> 58:43.830
Sergeant Willis has something to tell you.

58:43.880 --> 58:46.430
I'm sorry it's late, but I
thought you'd want to hear.

58:46.480 --> 58:49.110
- That depends what it is.
- Shall we go somewhere private?

58:49.160 --> 58:52.150
For God's sake, they've all lived
with this as long as we have.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.630
They've found a witness
to the meeting in the pub.

58:54.680 --> 58:57.590
They've tied them together.
Her confession is real.

58:57.640 --> 58:59.630
This time, it IS over.

59:05.080 --> 59:07.750
- Oh, I can't believe it!
- I shouldn't have come until now.

59:07.800 --> 59:09.590
I'm sorry. I should have waited.

59:09.640 --> 59:13.040
- Never mind that.
- I'll go and tell His Lordship.

59:14.840 --> 59:17.790
You both helped us when all hope was gone,

59:17.840 --> 59:19.710
and I'll not forget it.

59:19.760 --> 59:22.830
I find it hard to acknowledge a
debt but we owe a debt to you.

59:22.880 --> 59:24.870
Justice has triumphed.

59:24.920 --> 59:28.720
I'm not always convinced that
it does, but it has tonight.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.150
We must go down at once.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.190
What can we give them to drink?

59:33.240 --> 59:35.230
It depends how far you want to go, m'lord.

59:35.280 --> 59:38.270
There's some Veuve Cliquot in
a very cool part of the cellar.

59:38.320 --> 59:40.870
It's not iced, of course, but
it would be good to drink.

59:40.920 --> 59:44.350
Fetch it. Fetch three, four
bottles! We must mark this moment.

59:44.400 --> 59:47.590
It's been such a long road. Can
this really be the end of it?

59:47.640 --> 59:50.240
It seems so. And a happy ending!

59:55.600 --> 59:57.430
Anna!

59:57.480 --> 59:59.510
I knew this day would come, I really did.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.350
Everyone, take a glass, quick as you can,

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.480
while I propose a toast.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.310
British justice! Envy of the world.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.350
I suppose if it comes
out right in the end.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.870
We could've done with the
result a little sooner.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.750
Amen to that, m'lady.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.950
Andy, Daisy, go and fetch the gramophone.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.230
We never seem to use it
now Lady Rose has gone.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.110
Do we know any more about the
woman who did it, Sergeant Willis?

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.870
Only that she sent a message
to Mrs Bates, m'lady.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.070
She says she's sorry for leaving
it so long to take the blame.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.750
- That's all very well --
- Give her a message from me.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.790
Say I forgive her. Wish her luck.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.830
What will they do now?

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.350
She'll serve time for
manslaughter. She won't hang.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.390
So Mr Green goes on ruining lives.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.950
But not your life. Not any more.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.390
I'm sorry for what we've
put you through, Mrs Bates.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.470
I probably shouldn't say it, but I am.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.150
You did no more than your
duty, Sergeant Willis.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.150
We'll leave you to it.
Good night. Sleep well.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.800
There's more wine if you finish this.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.990
We'll sleep tonight, all right.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.340
And wake tomorrow without
that rock on our chests.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.390
I think I might go into
Thirsk in the morning,

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.150
visit some estate agents.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.870
Start planning again.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.920
But not for a family.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.550
I'm afraid we can't plan for that.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.590
We're free.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.840
We're safe, and I have you.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.630
That's enough, I promise.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.670
I know you want it to be true,

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.710
and I love you for it.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.790
So much.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.310
And I love you.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.310
- What are you doing?
- Is this the refrigerator?

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.350
It is.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.600
- Mrs Patmore hates it.
- Oh, of course she does.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.070
Don't eat anything
that's meant for tomorrow.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.910
Now, this takes me back.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.070
Did I ever tell you about our
cook when I was a boy, Mrs Yardley?

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.870
Many times.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.750
She was quite a crosspatch,
but she was always kind to me.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.710
She used to let me hide down
here when I was in trouble.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.390
She kept a box of biscuits
and sweets just for me.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.830
- Rosamund was furious.
- Rosamund was jealous.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.110
Come to bed.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.390
Sorry, Carson. We shouldn't be here.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.430
Oh, quite all right, m'lady.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.550
But I did want a private word
on the question of Daisy.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.630
I've heard what happened at the auction.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.950
I don't believe we can
allow it to go unnoticed.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.230
- No, I suppose not.
- It is a dismissible offence.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.230
Oh, isn't that a bit harsh? On
the day of Bates' good news?

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.230
I'm sure she regrets it.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.590
I daresay Guy Fawkes regretted
trying to blow up Parliament,

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.870
m'lady, but he still had to pay the price.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.670
Can't you just tick her off?

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.190
You'll know how to ensure
there's no repetition.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.670
Very good, m'lady, if
that's what you wish.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.710
We're going up. Good night.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.960
Good night, m'lord, m'lady.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.150
Have you thought about where
the Carsons will live?

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.110
- After they're married?
- Not really.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.150
I'd rather put it out of my mind.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.190
Will we have to call her Mrs Carson?

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.150
I'm not sure I can.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.670
We have higher mountains to climb.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.470
Have you come to a decision
about the hospital?

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.510
What sort of a decision?

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.070
I suppose I hope you can support
Mama's efforts to keep control.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.830
Better yet, stay out of it entirely.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.750
I can't stay out of it,
Robert. It's too important.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.110
And your mother, incidentally, is wrong.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.230
All of which adds up to a very
trying spring and summer ahead.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.390
I suppose you thought
there'd be no repercussions,

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.430
what with Mr Bates' news.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.590
No. I knew I hadn't heard the last of it.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.630
I just want to know how bad it'll be.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.390
Bad enough, I hope, to make you
feel small and foolish and immature,

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.790
and unable to control your
feelings in an adult manner.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.870
I feel all those things already.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:58.230
But not bad enough for
you to lose your place.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.510
If it were up to me,
it might be different.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.030
But Her Ladyship insisted
on a second chance.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.870
- Thank you, Mr Carson.
- Don't thank me, thank her.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.320
Now, get back to the party
before I change my mind.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.750
Right, well, shall we rejoin the others?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.800
Before we do...

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.240
.. I know I've been putting you off...

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.350
.. and Mrs Patmore spoke
of your conversation.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.390
I knew she would.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.590
I hope we've not shocked you between us.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.510
No, I'm not shocked.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.550
I thought it better to be honest.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.590
Once you'd raised the matter.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.630
I agree. Much better.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.710
I wouldn't want you to think
that I'd inveigled you

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.070
into an arrangement which
was not what you'd expected.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.190
I would never think that.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.230
Right.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.470
Well, if you've had second thoughts,

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.310
I think we should let the
staff know in the morning.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.350
I won't make a big announcement.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.590
We'll just tell one or two people
and let it come out naturally.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.110
There'll be a bit of a nine
days' wonder, of course,

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.510
but we'll get over it.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.760
But you misunderstand me.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.310
I was afraid I'd be a
disappointment to you.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.160
That I couldn't hope to
please you as I am now.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.360
But if you're sure...

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.960
I have never been so sure of anything.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.710
Well, then, Mr Carson...

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.670
If you want me, you can have me.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:55.920
To quote Oliver Cromwell, warts and all.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.470
I don't want to be a servant on
my wedding day. Is that so wrong?

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.750
The battle lines are drawn,
now we must fight it out.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.270
- I hope you are not implying she would
be more powerful than I. - Oh, no, indeed.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.550
Mary took Marigold to
the Drewes' farm today.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.790
When a woman loves a child,
it must stay with her.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.150
As you're aware, this is
the day of the Malton Show.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.830
Does it ever occur to you
that you might be wrong?

01:06:32.305 --> 01:06:38.789
