00:00.734 --> 00:01.735
<b>- Previously</b>
<b>on "All Stars... "</b>

00:01.768 --> 00:04.004
<b>- It's time to play</b>
<b>Snatch Game!</b>

00:04.037 --> 00:05.272
<b>[cheering]</b>

00:05.305 --> 00:06.940
<b>- What's an appro-ho?</b>
<b>Who you calling ho?</b>

00:06.974 --> 00:08.742
<b>[laughs]</b>

00:08.775 --> 00:10.110
<b>- Carson, I've been meaning</b>
<b>to get these back to you.</b>

00:10.143 --> 00:11.712
<b>[laughs]</b>

00:11.745 --> 00:15.048
<b>- Winner, winner,</b>
<b>chicken...dinner.</b>

00:15.082 --> 00:16.817
<b>- Crickets.</b>

00:17.818 --> 00:19.486
<b>- What's this?</b>
<b>- From Thorgy.</b>

00:19.520 --> 00:21.255
<b>It's says [bleep]</b>
<b>this shady bitch Shangela.</b>

00:21.288 --> 00:22.523
<b>- I didn't show it to you</b>

00:22.556 --> 00:25.092
<b>'cause I thought it was</b>
<b>not helpful or appropriate.</b>

00:25.125 --> 00:27.728
<b>- But you decided</b>
<b>to hang it on the wall?</b>

00:27.761 --> 00:29.830
<b>- Trixie Mattel.</b>
<b>- I didn't laugh,</b>

00:29.863 --> 00:31.398
<b>like, the whole time.</b>

00:31.431 --> 00:33.367
<b>- Kennedy Davenport.</b>

00:33.400 --> 00:35.202
<b>- To green leaves</b>
<b>on the bottom.</b>

00:35.235 --> 00:36.637
<b>Maybe up</b>
<b>the sophistication level.</b>

00:36.670 --> 00:38.238
<b>- Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

00:38.272 --> 00:40.140
<b>- You spelled</b>
<b>your name wrong.</b>

00:40.174 --> 00:42.342
<b>And it was like tumbleweeds.</b>

00:42.376 --> 00:44.244
<b>- Shangela.</b>

00:44.278 --> 00:46.280
<b>You're a winner, baby.</b>
<b>- Yay!</b>

00:46.313 --> 00:49.616
<b>- BenDeLaCreme.</b>
<b>You are also a winner, baby.</b>

00:49.650 --> 00:53.020
<b>- Oh!</b>

00:53.053 --> 00:55.956
<b>- There's two lipsticks.</b>
<b>It's bad.</b>

00:55.989 --> 01:00.260
<b>- Which queen have you chosen</b>
<b>to get the chop?</b>

01:00.294 --> 01:01.728
<b>- I chose Chi Chi.</b>

01:01.762 --> 01:03.263
<b>- Shangela?</b>

01:03.297 --> 01:05.199
<b>- This person left</b>
<b>"RuPaul's Drag Race"</b>

01:05.232 --> 01:06.700
<b>not winning the crown,</b>

01:06.733 --> 01:08.769
<b>but definitely</b>
<b>going forward as a winner</b>

01:08.802 --> 01:10.404
<b>and creating a career</b>
<b>for themselves.</b>

01:10.437 --> 01:12.940
<b>And I know they will do that</b>
<b>long after this</b>

01:12.973 --> 01:14.408
<b>because I believe</b>
<b>in their talent.</b>

01:14.441 --> 01:16.476
<b>I also chose Chi Chi.</b>

01:17.978 --> 01:20.380
<b>- Chi Chi, sashay away.</b>

01:28.821 --> 01:29.989
<b>- $5,000!</b>

01:30.022 --> 01:32.325
<b>- Oh, my gosh!</b>

01:32.358 --> 01:34.627
<b>That was crazy.</b>

01:34.660 --> 01:37.229
<b>- Oh, Chi Chi.</b>

01:37.263 --> 01:39.298
<b>- "Love all of you gals.</b>

01:39.332 --> 01:42.201
<b>Remember to keep it fair,</b>
<b>Chi Chi."</b>

01:42.234 --> 01:44.437
<b>- I haven't seen</b>
<b>a polite mirror message</b>

01:44.470 --> 01:46.772
<b>since Morgan, okay?</b>

01:46.806 --> 01:48.608
<b>She has</b>
<b>such a heart of gold.</b>

01:48.641 --> 01:50.276
<b>- We love you, Chi Chi.</b>

01:50.309 --> 01:51.377
<b>- My boo.</b>

01:51.410 --> 01:53.646
<b>- Chi Chi's</b>
<b>almost like my daughter.</b>

01:53.679 --> 01:57.583
<b>I am gonna miss her spirit</b>
<b>in the workroom.</b>

01:59.285 --> 02:01.153
<b>- Let's buy Shangela</b>
<b>a round of shots.</b>

02:01.187 --> 02:03.456
<b>- Well, I'll take that.</b>

02:03.489 --> 02:04.757
<b>But you know I'm watching</b>
<b>your station, mama.</b>

02:04.790 --> 02:07.460
<b>If I see another note,</b>
<b>it's a wrap. [laughs]</b>

02:07.493 --> 02:09.762
<b>I can't believe</b>
<b>I get a second chance.</b>

02:09.795 --> 02:11.764
<b>I guess I didn't know</b>
<b>if she would be able</b>

02:11.797 --> 02:13.933
<b>to put aside</b>
<b>with the whole drama</b>

02:13.966 --> 02:15.301
<b>about something Thorgy wrote.</b>

02:15.334 --> 02:17.803
<b>But Shangela made a decision</b>
<b>based on the competition,</b>

02:17.837 --> 02:19.939
<b>and I, like,</b>
<b>really respect that.</b>

02:19.972 --> 02:21.907
<b>My heart's on your side.</b>
<b>I'll never forget it.</b>

02:21.941 --> 02:22.942
<b>You'll never</b>
<b>have to buy drinks</b>

02:22.975 --> 02:24.644
<b>at the same bar</b>
<b>as me again, girl.</b>

02:24.677 --> 02:26.612
<b>And I will PayPal you</b>
<b>$10,000.</b>

02:26.646 --> 02:29.515
<b>- Oh, I've got 5K right now</b>
<b>for me and BenDeLa.</b>

02:29.548 --> 02:31.884
<b>I just want to clear the air</b>
<b>with Trixie.</b>

02:31.918 --> 02:34.387
<b>I hope that she sees</b>
<b>that by my decision</b>

02:34.420 --> 02:37.657
<b>that I am someone</b>
<b>who could be trusted</b>

02:37.690 --> 02:40.693
<b>and who could possibly</b>
<b>be an ally for her.</b>

02:40.726 --> 02:42.361
<b>Me and Trixie actually</b>
<b>have things in common,</b>

02:42.395 --> 02:44.196
<b>and I would love to focus on</b>
<b>those more</b>

02:44.230 --> 02:45.998
<b>so that we could help each other</b>
<b>get to the top.</b>

02:46.032 --> 02:48.567
<b>- While we're all sad</b>
<b>to see Chi Chi go,</b>

02:48.601 --> 02:50.903
<b>if we're just looking</b>
<b>at track record,</b>

02:50.937 --> 02:54.173
<b>today was actually</b>
<b>a fairly clear decision.</b>

02:54.173 --> 02:56.475
<b>And now we get to the point</b>

02:56.509 --> 02:58.711
<b>where being fair</b>

02:58.744 --> 03:01.948
<b>is going to be more muddy</b>
<b>than it was today.</b>

03:01.981 --> 03:04.283
<b>We're halfway through,</b>

03:04.317 --> 03:07.620
<b>and the criteria for how</b>
<b>we want to eliminate people</b>

03:07.653 --> 03:09.455
<b>is getting more confusing</b>

03:09.488 --> 03:13.025
<b>because some people have</b>
<b>been safe the whole time.</b>

03:13.059 --> 03:15.962
<b>Some people have been in the top</b>
<b>and the bottom.</b>

03:15.995 --> 03:18.331
<b>It's really hard to know</b>
<b>what to judge things on.</b>

03:18.364 --> 03:20.633
<b>- I mean, we would like to</b>
<b>all go on a group criteria</b>

03:20.666 --> 03:22.234
<b>that we all decide upon.</b>

03:22.268 --> 03:24.637
<b>But, honestly,</b>
<b>just letting y'all know,</b>

03:24.670 --> 03:26.138
<b>that ain't really</b>
<b>what's gonna go down.</b>

03:26.138 --> 03:28.274
<b>- We all are at the top,</b>

03:28.307 --> 03:32.612
<b>so our job</b>
<b>gets harder every week.</b>

03:32.645 --> 03:35.014
<b>- Just be respectful with</b>
<b>the mirror messages, people.</b>

03:35.047 --> 03:36.015
<b>[all laugh]</b>

03:36.048 --> 03:38.584
<b>- Everyone</b>
<b>is making these jokes,</b>

03:38.618 --> 03:41.153
<b>but you never know who will</b>
<b>pull the stunts here and there.</b>

03:41.187 --> 03:43.422
<b>There have been surprises</b>
<b>in the past.</b>

03:45.391 --> 03:48.494
<b>It's All Stars, girl.</b>
<b>Anything can happen.</b>

03:50.162 --> 03:52.498
<b>- The winner of "RuPaul's</b>
<b>Drag Race All Stars"</b>

03:52.531 --> 03:54.233
<b>receives a one year supply</b>

03:54.267 --> 03:56.669
<b>of Anastasia Beverly Hills</b>
<b>cosmetics,</b>

<b>With extra special guest judges</b>
<b>Shay Mitchell</b>

<b>♪ Best woman win </b>

<b>- Oh!</b>

<b>- Oh, the girls.</b>

04:20.559 --> 04:23.462
<b>Back in the mix</b>
<b>with the top six. Whoo!</b>

04:23.496 --> 04:24.897
<b>[alarm]</b>

04:24.931 --> 04:26.432
<b>[imitates alarm]</b>

04:26.465 --> 04:29.435
<b>- She done already</b>
<b>done had hers.</b>

04:29.468 --> 04:31.137
<b>- You wanna be an "it girl"?</b>

04:31.170 --> 04:33.306
<b>A real super star?</b>

04:33.339 --> 04:37.376
<b>Your 15 minutes of fame</b>
<b>starts now.</b>

04:39.245 --> 04:40.880
<b>Hello, hello, hello!</b>

04:40.913 --> 04:43.182
<b>[cheering]</b>

04:43.215 --> 04:44.784
<b>- Oh, my God!</b>

04:44.817 --> 04:49.021
<b>- Ladies, this week,</b>
<b>in tribute to my hero,</b>

04:49.055 --> 04:53.626
<b>we're throwing ourselves</b>
<b>a little Andy Warhol Ball.</b>

04:53.659 --> 04:55.995
<b>- Yeah!</b>
<b>- Yes!</b>

04:56.028 --> 04:59.732
<b>- Warhol's celebrity portraits</b>
<b>are worth millions,</b>

04:59.765 --> 05:04.337
<b>but many started out</b>
<b>as Polaroid snapshots.</b>

05:04.370 --> 05:07.473
<b>So for today's mini challenge,</b>

05:07.506 --> 05:10.776
<b>you'll pose</b>
<b>as I take a picture</b>

05:10.810 --> 05:15.514
<b>that we'll transform</b>
<b>into a pop art portrait</b>

05:15.548 --> 05:17.883
<b>that will be worth pennies.</b>

05:17.917 --> 05:19.418
<b>[all laugh]</b>

05:19.452 --> 05:23.856
<b>You've got 15 minutes</b>
<b>to get into quick drag.</b>

05:23.889 --> 05:24.991
<b>Get famous!</b>

05:25.024 --> 05:26.926
<b>- Yes!</b>

05:26.959 --> 05:28.828
<b>- I look like I'm in</b>
<b>an albino cast from Chicago.</b>

05:28.861 --> 05:30.496
<b>- [laughs]</b>

05:30.529 --> 05:31.931
<b>- Ladies,</b>
<b>you're not a real woman</b>

05:31.964 --> 05:32.999
<b>if you don't have perfume on!</b>

05:33.032 --> 05:36.269
<b>- All right, super stars,</b>
<b>time's up.</b>

05:36.302 --> 05:39.405
<b>First up, Kennedy Davenport.</b>

05:39.438 --> 05:41.007
<b>Ooh.</b>

05:41.040 --> 05:42.808
<b>What story</b>
<b>are your eyes gonna tell?</b>

05:42.842 --> 05:44.277
<b>- Dreamy.</b>

05:44.310 --> 05:45.411
<b>- Oh, that's nice,</b>
<b>that's nice.</b>

05:45.444 --> 05:47.780
<b>Why don't you show</b>
<b>top teeth like...</b>

05:47.813 --> 05:50.383
<b>But don't look like</b>
<b>I'm gonna hurt you or anything.</b>

05:50.416 --> 05:52.718
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>- That's beautiful.</b>

05:52.752 --> 05:54.153
<b>- Hey, sis.</b>

05:54.153 --> 05:57.256
<b>I know a thing or two</b>
<b>about old glamour.</b>

05:57.290 --> 05:59.158
<b>I got my Dita Von Teese hair.</b>

05:59.158 --> 06:01.227
<b>I'm gonna look good</b>
<b>in this Polaroid.</b>

06:01.260 --> 06:02.395
<b>Ooh, I feel like a model</b>
<b>right now.</b>

06:02.428 --> 06:04.864
<b>- You look like</b>
<b>Linda Evangelista.</b>

06:04.897 --> 06:06.432
<b>- One, two, three.</b>

06:06.465 --> 06:08.534
<b>I'll see you at Studio 54.</b>

06:09.802 --> 06:10.803
<b>Can you lean into it</b>
<b>like that?</b>

06:10.836 --> 06:13.172
<b>Yeah. Oh, nice. Lovely.</b>

06:13.172 --> 06:14.974
<b>Oh, that's nice,</b>
<b>that's nice.</b>

06:15.007 --> 06:17.276
<b>Oh, I can see this</b>
<b>hanging in the Louvre.</b>

06:17.310 --> 06:18.844
<b>- Is that the bathroom?</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

06:18.878 --> 06:19.979
<b>- Oh, my God!</b>

06:20.012 --> 06:21.213
<b>I didn't even know</b>
<b>this was happening.</b>

06:21.247 --> 06:23.849
<b>- Oh, look at Miss Trixie</b>
<b>looking all soft...</b>

06:23.883 --> 06:26.352
<b>softish.</b>

06:26.385 --> 06:28.821
<b>- I'm gonna do, like,</b>
<b>a punk rich woman.</b>

06:28.854 --> 06:30.423
<b>- Okay. All right.</b>
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

06:30.456 --> 06:31.891
<b>There's so much going on.</b>

06:33.926 --> 06:37.763
<b>- Ladies, one of you</b>
<b>is a true pop tart.</b>

06:40.433 --> 06:42.435
<b>Aja.</b>

06:42.468 --> 06:44.770
<b>- Yes!</b>

06:44.804 --> 06:46.238
<b>I have never won</b>
<b>a mini challenge.</b>

06:46.272 --> 06:47.607
<b>Bitch, I earned it.</b>

06:47.640 --> 06:50.876
<b>- You've won a year's worth</b>
<b>of hamburgers...</b>

06:50.910 --> 06:53.145
<b>- Ooh!</b>
<b>- From Hamburger Mary's.</b>

06:53.145 --> 06:54.146
<b>- I'm so hungry.</b>

06:54.146 --> 06:57.250
<b>- Plus $2,000 cash money,</b>
<b>honey.</b>

06:57.283 --> 06:58.684
<b>- All right.</b>

06:58.718 --> 07:02.521
<b>- And we'll be posting all</b>
<b>of your portraits on VH1.com.</b>

07:02.555 --> 07:04.624
<b>Now, ladies,</b>

07:04.657 --> 07:07.927
<b>our Warhol Ball</b>
<b>is just getting started.</b>

07:07.960 --> 07:10.263
<b>For this week's</b>
<b>maxi challenge,</b>

07:10.296 --> 07:11.564
<b>you'll need to create</b>

07:11.597 --> 07:15.735
<b>two Warhol-inspired looks</b>
<b>from scratch.</b>

07:17.370 --> 07:18.871
<b>- [inhales]</b>

07:18.904 --> 07:24.110
<b>- First look, in homage to his</b>
<b>iconic Campbell Soup can series,</b>

07:24.143 --> 07:27.913
<b>I want you</b>
<b>to become souper models.</b>

07:27.947 --> 07:31.617
<b>That's right. You need</b>
<b>to design a soup can</b>

07:31.651 --> 07:33.753
<b>that captures the true flavor</b>

07:33.786 --> 07:37.623
<b>of your charisma, uniqueness,</b>
<b>nerve and talent.</b>

07:37.657 --> 07:38.891
<b>Now, for your second look,</b>

07:38.925 --> 07:43.462
<b>inspired by Andy's</b>
<b>favorite nightclub, Studio 54,</b>

07:43.496 --> 07:47.533
<b>you need to design</b>
<b>disco queen couture.</b>

07:47.566 --> 07:52.405
<b>Now, to give you a sense</b>
<b>of how wild Studio 54 could be,</b>

07:52.438 --> 07:54.740
<b>Bianca Jagger</b>
<b>was once photographed</b>

07:54.774 --> 07:57.743
<b>entering the club</b>
<b>on a white horse.</b>

07:57.777 --> 07:59.745
<b>God, I miss quaaludes!</b>

07:59.779 --> 08:00.813
<b>[all laugh]</b>

08:00.846 --> 08:03.416
<b>You can use fabrics</b>
<b>provided by Mood</b>

08:03.449 --> 08:06.586
<b> and hair</b>
<b> provided by RockStar Wigs.</b>

08:06.619 --> 08:08.588
<b>Gentlemen,</b>
<b>start your engines,</b>

08:08.621 --> 08:11.624
<b>and may the best All Star win.</b>

08:12.992 --> 08:15.861
<b>- The maxi challenge</b>
<b>is to create a soup</b>

08:15.895 --> 08:18.898
<b>that reflects who you are</b>
<b>as a drag persona.</b>

08:18.931 --> 08:20.967
<b>Last week, I believed</b>
<b>I was going home,</b>

08:21.000 --> 08:22.234
<b>and this week,</b>
<b>I love sewing.</b>

08:22.268 --> 08:23.669
<b>I love making costumes.</b>

08:23.703 --> 08:25.838
<b>And I'm actually really good</b>
<b>at branding and selling stuff.</b>

08:25.871 --> 08:27.740
<b>So I'm feeling really good.</b>

08:27.773 --> 08:28.908
<b>I wanna win</b>
<b>a [bleep] challenge.</b>

08:28.941 --> 08:30.543
<b>Is anybody else</b>
<b>doing energy?</b>

08:30.576 --> 08:32.445
<b>- Well, I'm not doing energy.</b>
<b>I'm doing sugar.</b>

08:36.015 --> 08:38.117
<b>- Aja's making something</b>
<b>really sweet</b>

08:38.117 --> 08:40.686
<b>because she's sweet?</b>

08:40.720 --> 08:43.322
<b>- Like, sweets, like,</b>
<b>come get your sugar rush.</b>

08:43.356 --> 08:45.291
<b>Like, I want my soup</b>
<b>to be a candy soup.</b>

<b>- A candy-flavored soup?</b>

08:47.560 --> 08:50.763
<b>It's not interesting and doesn't</b>
<b>really brand you at all.</b>

08:50.796 --> 08:51.964
<b>That's, like, crazy.</b>

08:55.167 --> 08:57.236
<b>- Mine is spicy.</b>
<b>Mine is hot.</b>

08:57.270 --> 08:58.504
<b>And it's call "Achoo."</b>

08:58.537 --> 08:59.739
<b>- Achoo?</b>

08:59.772 --> 09:04.577
<b>- Yeah, it's like spicy,</b>

09:04.610 --> 09:05.845
<b>It's called "Achoo."</b>

09:05.878 --> 09:07.913

09:07.947 --> 09:09.148
<b>Achoo.</b>

09:09.148 --> 09:11.717
<b>Shouldn't soup help a cold,</b>

10:21.319 --> 10:22.453

10:22.487 --> 10:23.888
<b>Do you need</b>

10:23.921 --> 10:25.556

10:25.590 --> 10:26.658
<b>or start it for you?</b>

10:26.691 --> 10:28.559
<b>- I can cut it,</b>

10:28.593 --> 10:29.861
<b>Because</b>
<b>I don't know how to sew.</b>

10:29.894 --> 10:32.130
<b>Well, you can tell me</b>
<b>exactly what you need me to do.</b>

10:32.163 --> 10:35.233
<b>- Okay. Just get some fabric</b>

10:35.266 --> 10:37.502

10:37.535 --> 10:40.972
<b>I'm helping Bebe sew</b>

<b>'Cause if this fits,</b>

11:53.678 --> 11:55.680

11:55.713 --> 11:57.048

12:14.532 --> 12:17.001
<b>I guess I should've taken</b>

12:17.035 --> 12:18.202
<b>That's what</b>
<b>I should have taken.</b>

12:18.202 --> 12:19.337

<b>- I mean, I'm impressed with her</b>

<b>but she too much.</b>

13:27.372 --> 13:29.240

<b>that you're gonna make your</b>

<b>where everybody</b>
<b>is performing at a high level?</b>

13:50.962 --> 13:52.764
<b>Something</b>
<b>I really wanted to do</b>

13:52.797 --> 13:55.366
<b>was, like, kind of write</b>
<b>who placed where every week.</b>

13:55.400 --> 13:57.535
<b>Kind of try to, like,</b>
<b>do some math about it</b>

13:57.568 --> 13:59.037
<b>just to be technical.</b>

13:59.070 --> 14:00.438
<b>- Girl.</b>

14:00.471 --> 14:03.675
<b>- Does it help more if somebody</b>
<b>has, like, been in the top</b>

14:03.708 --> 14:05.410
<b>but has also</b>
<b>been in the bottom?</b>

14:05.443 --> 14:07.445
<b>Or if somebody's been,</b>
<b>like, consistently safe?</b>

14:07.478 --> 14:08.913
<b>- Jesus.</b>

14:08.946 --> 14:10.815
<b>- Honestly, I don't want</b>

<b>of, like, figuring it out</b>
<b>or deciding it.</b>

14:12.650 --> 14:14.052
<b>I'd really rather</b>
<b>be, like, okay,</b>

<b>this is, like, the technical way</b>
<b>I've decided to do this.</b>

14:17.488 --> 14:20.625
<b>- Girl, come on.</b>
<b>Get out your head.</b>

14:20.658 --> 14:23.494
<b>If it was me</b>

<b>Maybe she just</b>
<b>can't handle it.</b>

<b>- If we're basing it</b>
<b>on track record--</b>

14:35.206 --> 14:39.010
<b>- As we should not.</b>
<b>I don't think we should.</b>

14:39.043 --> 14:41.913
<b>It's not like, ooh,</b>
<b>we should do it this way</b>

14:41.946 --> 14:43.514
<b>or we should do it that way.</b>

14:43.548 --> 14:45.483
<b>Just play the game,</b>
<b>and when you end up in the top,</b>

14:45.516 --> 14:46.617
<b>you know what you gotta do.</b>

14:46.651 --> 14:48.519

<b>For whatever reason it may be,</b>
<b>it's yours.</b>

14:51.823 --> 14:52.890

<b>we wouldn't make</b>
<b>our own decision.</b>

14:54.492 --> 14:56.160

24:41.287 --> 24:43.022
<b>[all laugh]</b>

24:43.055 --> 24:45.391
<b>I did make an effort</b>

<b>But, you know,</b>
<b>it's just not my gimmick.</b>

24:50.563 --> 24:53.265
<b>And I can hold my head high</b>
<b>in saying that, you know,</b>

24:53.265 --> 24:55.634
<b>at least I didn't bow down.</b>
<b>Halle-loo.</b>

24:55.668 --> 24:57.169
<b>- Thank you, Shangela.</b>

24:57.269 --> 24:58.771
<b>Up next, Trixie Mattel.</b>

24:58.804 --> 25:00.473
<b>- Hi, guys.</b>

25:00.506 --> 25:01.807
<b>- All I can say is R.I.P.</b>
<b>to this challenge,</b>

25:01.841 --> 25:02.875
<b>'cause you murdered it.</b>

25:02.908 --> 25:04.176
<b>- The can came out.</b>

25:04.276 --> 25:05.745
<b>You could have been backstage,</b>

25:05.778 --> 25:07.046
<b>and I would have known</b>
<b>that was your can.</b>

25:07.079 --> 25:09.915
<b>- This is definitely</b>
<b>giving me disco Barbie.</b>

25:09.949 --> 25:12.084
<b>I mean, the whole look</b>
<b>is so great.</b>

25:12.118 --> 25:14.587
<b>- It tells me a story</b>
<b>of a country girl</b>

25:14.620 --> 25:17.957
<b>who decided I have to fit in</b>
<b>at Studio 54.</b>

25:17.990 --> 25:21.360
<b>And the best part about it</b>
<b>is you made it.</b>

25:21.394 --> 25:22.361
<b>- I did.</b>

25:22.395 --> 25:24.196
<b>- You know what</b>
<b>your body shape is.</b>

25:24.296 --> 25:25.865
<b>The arms, the legs,</b>
<b>the width.</b>

25:25.898 --> 25:28.834
<b>Even the camel toe.</b>
<b>It's all good.</b>

25:28.868 --> 25:30.069
<b>- There's not enough money</b>
<b>in the world</b>

25:30.102 --> 25:31.037
<b>for me to put tape</b>
<b>on my dick.</b>

25:31.070 --> 25:32.104
<b>- You have a dick?</b>
<b>[all laugh]</b>

25:32.138 --> 25:34.073
<b>- I think it's in the back</b>
<b>somewhere.</b>

25:34.106 --> 25:37.777
<b>- I don't know if you got</b>
<b>the invite late or what,</b>

25:37.810 --> 25:40.579
<b>but you RSVP'd</b>
<b>and you showed up today.</b>

25:40.613 --> 25:42.648
<b>- The Trixie that I wanted</b>
<b>has finally arrived.</b>

25:42.681 --> 25:45.351
<b>Yep, yep, yep, yep.</b>

25:45.384 --> 25:46.919
<b>- [laughs]</b>

25:46.952 --> 25:48.587
<b>Kennedy Davenport.</b>

25:48.621 --> 25:50.022
<b>- Listen, I know you're quirky</b>
<b>and you do fun things,</b>

25:50.056 --> 25:52.792
<b>but when you came out, I was</b>
<b>like why is she a grandma?</b>

25:52.825 --> 25:54.660
<b>This is a branding challenge,</b>

25:54.694 --> 25:56.796
<b>so you want to brand</b>
<b>what you're known for.</b>

25:56.829 --> 25:58.297
<b>- Right.</b>
<b>- It didn't work.</b>

25:58.330 --> 25:59.699
<b> I didn't get the story.</b>

25:59.732 --> 26:01.600
<b>I didn't get the connection.</b>

26:01.634 --> 26:02.768
<b>- It was more</b>
<b>branding the booty.</b>

26:02.802 --> 26:04.003
<b>- I would have led with that.</b>

26:04.036 --> 26:06.972
<b>But, oh, my God,</b>
<b>your face and your hair.</b>

26:07.006 --> 26:09.341
<b>- You have my favorite</b>
<b>disco queen look,</b>

26:09.375 --> 26:10.710
<b>and you would definitely</b>
<b>be catching</b>

26:10.743 --> 26:12.578
<b>everybody's attention</b>
<b>at Studio 54.</b>

26:12.611 --> 26:14.847
<b>- You meshed regal</b>
<b>like a super hero</b>

26:14.880 --> 26:16.415
<b>and seventies</b>
<b>all at the same time.</b>

26:16.449 --> 26:17.850
<b>You look absolutely beautiful.</b>

26:17.883 --> 26:19.952
<b>- Thank you.</b>

26:19.985 --> 26:21.287
<b>- Up next, Bebe.</b>

26:21.287 --> 26:22.288
<b>- Hi, Mother.</b>

26:22.288 --> 26:24.090
<b>- Is peanut soup</b>
<b>a thing in Cameroon?</b>

26:24.123 --> 26:27.426
<b>- It is. It's one of,</b>
<b>like, our delicacies.</b>

26:27.460 --> 26:29.695
<b>- Ooh, it sounds delicious.</b>

26:29.729 --> 26:30.730
<b>- [laughs]</b>

26:30.763 --> 26:32.264
<b>- I thought your can</b>
<b>was beautiful.</b>

26:32.298 --> 26:34.500
<b>Artistically,</b>
<b>it was very understated.</b>

26:34.533 --> 26:36.135
<b>If it was a print,</b>
<b>I would hang that.</b>

26:36.235 --> 26:38.871
<b>- And because</b>
<b>you represent a country</b>

26:38.904 --> 26:40.072
<b>and you're very proud of it,</b>

26:40.106 --> 26:41.841
<b>the branding</b>
<b>worked beautifully.</b>

26:41.874 --> 26:45.378
<b>And, baby, when baby Bebe</b>
<b>walked out got on this runway,</b>

26:45.411 --> 26:47.313
<b>I about lost my mind.</b>

26:47.346 --> 26:51.016
<b>Absolutely stunning.</b>
<b>You made this?</b>

26:51.050 --> 26:53.019
<b>- I did.</b>
<b>- So beautiful.</b>

26:53.052 --> 26:55.121
<b>I really don't have</b>
<b>any negatives to say,</b>

26:55.154 --> 26:56.155
<b>and that ain't easy.</b>

26:56.255 --> 26:57.957
<b>- Everything</b>
<b>from the accessories,</b>

26:57.990 --> 26:59.658
<b>to the jewels on your face,</b>

26:59.692 --> 27:01.327
<b>it's 10 out of 10</b>
<b>for this look.</b>

27:01.360 --> 27:02.361
<b>- Thank you.</b>

27:02.395 --> 27:04.096
<b>- Up next, BenDeLaCreme.</b>

27:04.130 --> 27:05.164
<b>- Hi.</b>

27:05.264 --> 27:07.833
<b>- So your can tonight</b>
<b>was fantastic.</b>

27:07.867 --> 27:09.502
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- The colors were you.</b>

27:09.535 --> 27:11.037
<b>Your hair was adorable.</b>

27:11.070 --> 27:13.806
<b>It was terminally delightful.</b>
<b>That's your brand.</b>

27:13.839 --> 27:15.641
<b>- I like this look.</b>

27:15.674 --> 27:16.942
<b>I don't love this look.</b>

27:16.976 --> 27:19.678
<b>It doesn't scream</b>
<b>disco queen.</b>

27:19.712 --> 27:20.946
<b>- You're definitely</b>
<b>not the queen.</b>

27:20.980 --> 27:23.282
<b>You're probably in line</b>
<b>trying to get into the club.</b>

27:23.315 --> 27:25.384
<b>- I feel like I'm in the alley</b>
<b>behind the disco.</b>

27:25.418 --> 27:27.086
<b>- Listen, it does not suck.</b>

27:27.119 --> 27:29.588
<b>But it's simple, basic.</b>

27:29.622 --> 27:31.557
<b>You can do better and more.</b>

27:31.590 --> 27:34.226
<b>- And I don't know if you're</b>
<b>tired tonight or something,</b>

27:34.226 --> 27:36.762
<b>but we are at the edge of our</b>
<b>seats every time you walk out</b>

27:36.796 --> 27:38.030
<b>just because of the level</b>
<b>you've been performing.</b>

27:38.064 --> 27:39.732
<b>So if it's not at 120,</b>

27:39.765 --> 27:44.370
<b>if it's just at 100,</b>
<b>we're like, oh, 100. Okay.</b>

27:44.403 --> 27:47.239
<b>- Thank you, ladies.</b>

27:47.239 --> 27:49.442
<b>Based on</b>
<b>the judges' critiques,</b>

27:49.475 --> 27:51.744
<b>I've made some decisions.</b>

27:53.913 --> 27:56.348
<b>Bebe Zahara Benet,</b>

27:56.382 --> 27:59.518
<b>Trixie Mattel,</b>

27:59.552 --> 28:00.686
<b>Con-drag-ulations.</b>

28:00.720 --> 28:03.289
<b>You are the top two All Stars</b>
<b>of the week.</b>

28:03.322 --> 28:05.124
<b>[applause]</b>

28:05.157 --> 28:09.061
<b>You each won</b>
<b>a two-night escape for two</b>

28:09.095 --> 28:12.331
<b>at the W Hotel,</b>
<b>Fort Lauderdale.</b>

28:14.734 --> 28:17.803
<b>BenDeLaCreme,</b>
<b>Kennedy Davenport.</b>

28:19.004 --> 28:20.339
<b>You are safe.</b>

28:20.373 --> 28:21.674
<b>- [exhales]</b>
<b>Thank you, Lord.</b>

28:21.707 --> 28:22.675
<b>- Thank you.</b>

28:22.708 --> 28:25.544
<b>- That means Aja</b>
<b>and Shangela,</b>

28:25.578 --> 28:27.413
<b>you are the bottom two.</b>

28:29.582 --> 28:33.586
<b>Trixie and Bebe,</b>
<b>each of you needs to decide</b>

28:33.619 --> 28:36.889
<b>which of the bottom two</b>
<b>you'll eliminate</b>

28:36.922 --> 28:39.258
<b>if you win the lip sync.</b>

28:39.291 --> 28:42.962
<b>Thank you, ladies.</b>
<b>You may leave the stage.</b>

28:44.296 --> 28:45.531
<b>- Coming up...</b>

28:45.564 --> 28:46.532
<b>- I'm just trying to smile,</b>

28:46.565 --> 28:49.235
<b>and sometimes</b>
<b>it's just so hard.</b>

28:49.235 --> 28:51.971
<b>- My mood</b>
<b>just changed to fear.</b>

28:52.004 --> 28:54.140
<b>- Someone's feelings</b>
<b>are going to be hurt.</b>

28:54.240 --> 28:55.374
<b>- Ah, bitch.</b>

28:55.408 --> 28:55.474
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

29:03.901 --> 29:06.471
<b>- ♪ Oh, my God </b>

29:06.504 --> 29:08.306
<b>- I've never been</b>
<b>in a position</b>

29:08.339 --> 29:12.376
<b>where I had to choose</b>
<b>who to eliminate.</b>

29:12.410 --> 29:14.812
<b>And it's like are you going to</b>
<b>be honest about the situation?</b>

29:14.846 --> 29:16.948
<b>Are you going</b>
<b>to play the game?</b>

29:16.981 --> 29:19.050
<b>How do you choose</b>
<b>who's gonna go home?</b>

29:19.083 --> 29:21.753
<b>- Shangela and Aja,</b>
<b>how are you guys feeling?</b>

29:21.786 --> 29:24.655
<b>- I mean, this is my first time</b>
<b>in the bottom,</b>

29:24.689 --> 29:26.057
<b>and it's just...</b>

29:28.259 --> 29:29.627
<b>We know what it is.</b>

29:30.695 --> 29:33.364
<b>- I've never felt</b>
<b>more drag scalped,</b>

29:33.398 --> 29:34.432
<b>like, murdered.</b>

29:34.465 --> 29:36.801
<b>At that moment,</b>
<b>I was like, whoa.</b>

29:36.834 --> 29:38.970
<b>- I just cracked.</b>

29:39.003 --> 29:40.104
<b>And to see her being cracked</b>

29:40.138 --> 29:43.374
<b>when just this morning</b>
<b>she was, like,</b>

29:43.408 --> 29:44.742
<b>I'm gonna win the challenge.</b>

29:44.776 --> 29:47.345
<b>It's a testament to how</b>
<b>you can't be too confident.</b>

29:47.378 --> 29:49.313
<b>- I wanna talk.</b>
<b>Do you wanna talk?</b>

29:49.347 --> 29:51.983
<b>- Yeah. It really helps.</b>
<b>- Do you wanna talk?</b>

29:52.016 --> 29:53.217
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- Let's do it.</b>

29:53.251 --> 29:54.218
<b>- Well, TYA.</b>

29:54.252 --> 29:55.653
<b>- TYA?</b>
<b>- Turn your ass.</b>

29:55.686 --> 29:59.624
<b>[all laugh]</b>

29:59.657 --> 30:01.125
<b>- Hi, sister.</b>
<b>- Hi, sis.</b>

30:01.159 --> 30:04.195
<b>Oh, my gosh.</b>
<b>How you feeling?</b>

30:04.295 --> 30:06.531
<b>- I'm hoping that this moment</b>
<b>won't define</b>

30:06.564 --> 30:09.000
<b>how much I can bring</b>
<b>to this competition.</b>

30:09.033 --> 30:10.968
<b>You have</b>
<b>a hard choice to make,</b>

30:11.002 --> 30:14.439
<b>and regardless of what else,</b>
<b>you are always my sister.</b>

30:14.472 --> 30:18.476
<b>- I do feel like Shangela</b>
<b>has shown amazing work,</b>

30:18.509 --> 30:20.344
<b>but Aja is a fireball.</b>

30:20.378 --> 30:22.547
<b>Aja is somebody</b>
<b>who has shown a lot of growth</b>

30:22.580 --> 30:23.648
<b>compared to Season 9.</b>

30:23.681 --> 30:26.084
<b>So it's really, really hard.</b>

30:26.117 --> 30:27.718
<b>Oh, bitch.</b>

30:28.753 --> 30:30.855
<b>- Maybe I can't</b>
<b>pronounce names right,</b>

30:30.888 --> 30:33.324
<b>but, like, I really</b>
<b>made this with the intent</b>

30:33.324 --> 30:36.127
<b>to, like, really be couture</b>
<b>and high fashion</b>

30:36.160 --> 30:37.562
<b>and still give disco.</b>

30:37.595 --> 30:41.332
<b>- On one hand, I think Aja's</b>
<b>runway was the most beautiful.</b>

30:41.332 --> 30:43.334
<b>On the other hand,</b>
<b>the judges didn't.</b>

30:43.334 --> 30:45.770
<b>And her can</b>
<b>was, like, terrible.</b>

30:45.803 --> 30:48.072
<b>It had nothing</b>
<b>to do with Aja.</b>

30:48.106 --> 30:50.475
<b>- I [bleep] up so bad</b>
<b>on my season,</b>

30:50.508 --> 30:53.544
<b>and I want to go</b>
<b>as far as I can.</b>

30:53.578 --> 30:55.646
<b>- I know you do.</b>

30:55.680 --> 30:58.316
<b>- When Ross was like</b>
<b>"I sort of feel bad for you</b>

30:58.349 --> 30:59.650
<b>because</b>
<b>you perform so well,"</b>

30:59.684 --> 31:02.186
<b>it's, like, we need to see</b>
<b>120% every time.</b>

31:02.286 --> 31:04.088
<b>And, like, I don't know whether</b>
<b>you're just tired or what.</b>

31:04.122 --> 31:05.957
<b>I was, like, yes, I'm tired!</b>

31:05.990 --> 31:08.159
<b>I am exhausted every minute!</b>

31:08.192 --> 31:09.827
<b>You just happened</b>
<b>to notice this time.</b>

31:09.861 --> 31:10.828
<b>- I noticed, too.</b>

31:10.862 --> 31:12.597
<b>- What?</b>

31:12.630 --> 31:14.665
<b>- I noticed, too, this challenge</b>
<b>was working you.</b>

31:14.699 --> 31:15.833
<b>- Oh, my God, yeah.</b>

31:15.867 --> 31:17.668
<b>- You let this challenge</b>
<b>work your ass,</b>

31:17.702 --> 31:23.307
<b> and then it kind of like</b>
<b> spewed a little onstage.</b>

31:23.307 --> 31:25.877
<b>- Wait. What does that mean,</b>
<b>spewed a little onstage?</b>

31:25.910 --> 31:28.179
<b>- Like you kind of</b>
<b>let it show.</b>

31:28.212 --> 31:29.714
<b>- Oh, really?</b>
<b>When I was walking--</b>

31:29.747 --> 31:33.117
<b>- That you were not like</b>
<b>your usual self, you know.</b>

31:33.151 --> 31:34.385
<b>- Kennedy's saying that</b>

31:34.419 --> 31:36.621
<b>I seemed like my energy</b>
<b>is a little lower,</b>

31:36.654 --> 31:37.622
<b>and it's like, duh.</b>

31:37.655 --> 31:39.357
<b>I just won</b>
<b>a million challenges</b>

31:39.390 --> 31:40.925
<b>'cause I was working</b>
<b>super hard.</b>

31:42.160 --> 31:45.329
<b>I have had to not only</b>
<b>pull it out</b>

31:45.329 --> 31:48.099
<b>in everything that we've done</b>
<b>as we all have,</b>

31:48.132 --> 31:51.669
<b>I have also</b>
<b>had to decide every week</b>

31:51.702 --> 31:53.204
<b>who is gonna walk out</b>
<b>of this workroom.</b>

31:53.237 --> 31:56.340
<b>And that emotionally</b>
<b>is enough.</b>

31:56.340 --> 31:57.742
<b>- It is trying. Mm-hmm.</b>

31:57.775 --> 31:59.077
<b>- I don't wanna be</b>
<b>on the judges panel.</b>

31:59.110 --> 32:00.311
<b>I wanna be one of the girls.</b>

32:00.344 --> 32:03.448
<b>So, anyway,</b>
<b>blah-blah-blah. Poor me.</b>

32:03.481 --> 32:05.316
<b>- BenDeLa is relieved</b>

32:05.349 --> 32:07.852
<b>that she has been taken off</b>
<b>of this high horse, honey.</b>

32:07.885 --> 32:10.922
<b>Some people are not made to deal</b>
<b>with that type of pressure.</b>

32:10.955 --> 32:14.959
<b>But, listen,</b>
<b>if you don't want to win,</b>

32:14.992 --> 32:16.861
<b>stop playing to win.</b>

32:19.163 --> 32:21.499
<b>- We were just here, bitch.</b>

32:21.532 --> 32:22.533
<b>- Yeah.</b>

32:22.567 --> 32:24.435
<b>- Do you want</b>
<b>this chair back?</b>

32:24.469 --> 32:27.004
<b>- Mama, it's a whole</b>
<b>different dynamic now.</b>

32:27.038 --> 32:28.706
<b>- If the tables were turned,</b>

32:28.740 --> 32:30.341
<b>I wouldn't expect Shangela</b>
<b>to save me</b>

32:30.374 --> 32:32.543
<b>just because</b>
<b>I saved her once.</b>

32:32.577 --> 32:33.678
<b>That falls into more</b>

32:33.711 --> 32:35.313
<b>of a RuPaul's Best Friend</b>
<b>Race category,</b>

32:35.313 --> 32:37.215
<b>and it should be judged on</b>
<b>did you do the worst?</b>

32:37.315 --> 32:39.117
<b>She knows her outfit</b>
<b>was the worst outfit.</b>

32:39.150 --> 32:41.486
<b>It's maybe the worst thing</b>
<b>I've seen on "Drag Race."</b>

32:41.519 --> 32:43.554
<b>It's getting hard. It's getting</b>
<b>really hard, you know.</b>

32:43.588 --> 32:45.823
<b>But she has one of the best</b>
<b>track records here.</b>

32:45.857 --> 32:47.892
<b>Look how many weeks</b>
<b>she's hit homeruns.</b>

32:47.925 --> 32:50.228
<b>But I don't know</b>
<b>if those homeruns</b>

32:50.328 --> 32:52.463
<b>outweigh the fact that there's</b>
<b>a record glued to her head.</b>

32:52.497 --> 32:53.631
<b>I don't know.</b>

32:53.664 --> 32:55.233
<b>- I know you have</b>
<b>a rough decision,</b>

32:55.333 --> 32:59.070
<b>but I could see us next week</b>
<b>top five, top four, top three.</b>

32:59.103 --> 33:01.139
<b>I see that for you.</b>
<b>I see that for me.</b>

33:01.172 --> 33:02.306
<b>I wanna stay.</b>

33:02.340 --> 33:03.408
<b>- I know you do.</b>

33:03.441 --> 33:04.742
<b>- Whatever choice you make,</b>

33:04.776 --> 33:06.911
<b>you'll forever be a top three</b>
<b>kind of person to me.</b>

33:06.944 --> 33:09.914
<b>When Daenerys is creating</b>
<b>alliances on "Game of Thrones,"</b>

33:09.947 --> 33:11.983
<b>she's creating them</b>
<b>out of mutual respect,</b>

33:12.016 --> 33:14.485
<b>and that's what I hope I've done</b>
<b>in this competition.</b>

33:14.519 --> 33:15.787
<b>But I love you.</b>
<b>- You're a real life All Star.</b>

33:15.820 --> 33:17.688
<b>- I've done my best</b>
<b>at creating these alliances,</b>

33:17.722 --> 33:20.124
<b>and now I'm just</b>
<b>gonna leave it up to them.</b>

33:20.158 --> 33:21.993
<b>- First of all,</b>
<b>I'm going to let you know</b>

33:22.026 --> 33:24.328
<b>that you look</b>
<b>really beautiful today</b>

33:24.362 --> 33:26.097
<b>and you're very authentic.</b>

33:26.130 --> 33:27.465
<b>and I like the fact</b>

33:27.498 --> 33:29.200
<b>that I can see you</b>
<b>just blossoming right here.</b>

33:29.300 --> 33:30.868
<b>And I watched you tonight.</b>

33:30.902 --> 33:32.103
<b>- I just wanna make it</b>
<b>to the top.</b>

33:32.136 --> 33:33.838
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- So I'm not, like...</b>

33:33.871 --> 33:36.340
<b>- No matter what,</b>
<b>you've made it.</b>

33:36.374 --> 33:37.642
<b>You're here.</b>

33:37.675 --> 33:39.577
<b>- [sighs]</b>
<b>I'm trying to tell her</b>

33:39.610 --> 33:41.079
<b>why I think I should stay,</b>

33:41.112 --> 33:42.914
<b>but Bebe</b>
<b>is not letting me talk</b>

33:42.947 --> 33:44.449
<b>and she's just going on.</b>

33:44.482 --> 33:46.617
<b>- It's just how far</b>
<b>you have made--</b>

33:46.651 --> 33:48.319
<b>You have made it, girl.</b>

33:48.319 --> 33:49.887
<b>- And I can't even</b>
<b>plead my case.</b>

33:52.123 --> 33:54.125
<b>- I just want to say</b>
<b>I'm very proud of you</b>

33:54.158 --> 33:55.793
<b>because you are just a star</b>
<b>in my eyes</b>

33:55.827 --> 33:57.128
<b>and I really love you.</b>

33:57.161 --> 34:00.798
<b>So let's go back</b>
<b>to the group, honey.</b>

34:00.832 --> 34:02.066
<b>I love you, my sis.</b>

34:03.968 --> 34:07.538
<b>- My entire mood</b>
<b>just changed to fear.</b>

34:08.573 --> 34:10.508
<b>[sighs]</b>

34:10.541 --> 34:11.743
<b>- What's going on, sis?</b>

34:11.776 --> 34:14.479
<b>Because I know</b>
<b>how you feel, so...</b>

34:14.512 --> 34:17.648
<b>- Yeah. I just feel</b>
<b>so numb right now.</b>

34:17.682 --> 34:19.050
<b>I'm just trying to smile,</b>

34:19.083 --> 34:21.853
<b>and just have a good time.</b>

34:21.886 --> 34:24.489
<b>Sometimes</b>
<b>it's just so hard.</b>

34:24.522 --> 34:27.291
<b>- It hurts me</b>
<b>to see her so broken.</b>

34:27.291 --> 34:30.061
<b>But I get it.</b>
<b>This is scary.</b>

34:30.094 --> 34:31.462
<b>One of us is going home.</b>

34:39.170 --> 34:40.972
<b>- I'm thinking about</b>
<b>who did the worst today?</b>

34:41.005 --> 34:42.874
<b>Who did the best today?</b>
<b>Who has the best track record?</b>

34:42.907 --> 34:44.976
<b>Who can save my skin</b>
<b>tomorrow?</b>

34:45.009 --> 34:46.778
<b>I could stare at these</b>
<b>two lipsticks all day,</b>

34:46.811 --> 34:49.313
<b>but it's one resounding</b>
<b>gut feeling.</b>

34:51.082 --> 34:53.885
<b>- I have to kind of</b>
<b>look at everything.</b>

34:53.918 --> 34:56.988
<b>I can't look at just</b>
<b>the judges' critiques.</b>

34:57.021 --> 34:59.624
<b>I have to look at</b>
<b>the whole picture.</b>

34:59.657 --> 35:02.960
<b>But I do believe that I have</b>
<b>made the right decision.</b>

35:02.994 --> 35:05.430
<b>My decision is honest.</b>

35:05.463 --> 35:06.798
<b>But I know in spite of that,</b>

35:06.831 --> 35:09.167
<b>someone's feelings</b>
<b>are going to be hurt.</b>

35:11.069 --> 35:11.135
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

35:18.520 --> 35:20.522
<b>- Welcome back, ladies.</b>

35:20.555 --> 35:24.292
<b>Two top All Stars</b>
<b>stand before me.</b>

35:24.326 --> 35:27.863
<b>Ladies, this is your chance</b>
<b>to impress me,</b>

<b>win $10,000,</b>
<b>and earn the power</b>

<b>to give one of the bottom queens</b>

<b>The time has come...</b>
<b>[thunder]</b>

<b>for you to lip sync...</b>

35:41.743 --> 35:44.079
<b>[echoing] for your legacy!</b>

35:45.247 --> 35:46.848
<b>- I want to win the lip sync</b>
<b>for once.</b>

35:46.882 --> 35:49.317
<b>On Season 7, I'll lost</b>
<b>a lip sync to Pearl.</b>

35:49.351 --> 35:50.952
<b>Do you know what it's like</b>
<b>to lose a lip sync</b>

35:50.986 --> 35:52.687
<b>to a partially sedated twink</b>
<b>from Brooklyn?</b>

35:52.721 --> 35:54.790

<b>I've decided to audition</b>
