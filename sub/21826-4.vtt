WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:06.099
Leo, what do you want for lunch today?

00:06.100 --> 00:08.020
You can have beef ribs or pork ribs.

00:08.021 --> 00:10.776
I want a sensible salad
with dressing on the side.

00:10.777 --> 00:13.030
Ugh, the things your father teaches you.

00:13.031 --> 00:15.577
Annette, you're early.

00:15.578 --> 00:17.790
Hey, can you please go make
small talk with your grandma?

00:17.791 --> 00:21.046
I'll be out in a bit.

00:21.047 --> 00:23.050
It's not Ma, it's me.

00:23.051 --> 00:25.054
And 45 minutes early, is early.

00:25.055 --> 00:27.183
15 minutes early is on time.

00:27.184 --> 00:30.524
- On time is late.
- That's really great, Danny.

00:30.525 --> 00:32.402
Nice to see you.
Hey, what're you doing here?

00:32.403 --> 00:33.697
It's not Saturday.

00:33.698 --> 00:35.074
Well, Ma wasn't feeling well,

00:35.075 --> 00:36.493
so I thought I'd take Leo to school

00:36.494 --> 00:40.376
because you got so much going on

00:40.377 --> 00:42.213
with your divorce and everything.

00:42.214 --> 00:44.092
I'm sorry, Danny, I couldn't hear you

00:44.093 --> 00:46.305
through the walls of your glass house.

00:46.306 --> 00:48.350
You were married for, like,
two seconds longer than me.

00:48.351 --> 00:51.231
I'm not getting a divorce.
I'm getting an annulment.

00:51.232 --> 00:53.695
Totally different. God's little eraser.

00:53.696 --> 00:56.199
But you, there was Casey, me,
and now nurse hair gel.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.995
- What's his name?
- His name is Bun.

00:57.996 --> 00:59.915
Ben. His name is Ben.

00:59.916 --> 01:02.170
And that was my only divorce.

01:02.171 --> 01:04.174
If I wasn't such a low-key nice person,

01:04.175 --> 01:05.969
I would point out
that you've been divorced

01:05.970 --> 01:08.098
from basically every
blonde woman in Manhattan.

01:08.099 --> 01:09.769
- It was two.
- Okay.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.522
Okay, enough. I gotta get Leo to school.

01:11.523 --> 01:13.693
- Is he wearing red?
- No, why would he wear red?

01:13.694 --> 01:15.363
You know that hot colors wash him out.

01:15.364 --> 01:17.241
The kids are doing
their unit on gay pride.

01:17.242 --> 01:19.329
Leo's the red in the rainbow.
Top billing. Come on.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.333
Do you not read your Bleecker
Friends' weekly emails?

01:21.334 --> 01:23.128
It's just that they send 20 a day

01:23.129 --> 01:24.590
and they're all the same.
You know, like,

01:24.591 --> 01:26.218
"Blah, blah, blah, give money,

01:26.219 --> 01:28.013
something, something, Yom Kippur, lice."

01:28.014 --> 01:30.393
Yeah, last week we almost
had to shave Leo's head.

01:30.394 --> 01:33.232
For Yom Kippur? When will it end?

01:33.233 --> 01:36.823
Okay, look, Min, I know
you and I are really busy,

01:36.824 --> 01:38.535
but I gotta tell you,

01:38.536 --> 01:40.831
Ma spends more time at school
than you do.

01:40.832 --> 01:43.168
People are starting to think
she and I are Leo's parents.

01:43.169 --> 01:46.299
Like I could ever score
a beauty like that, mm.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.053
Please don't bite your lip like that

01:48.054 --> 01:49.765
- about your own mother.
- I didn't bite my lip.

01:49.766 --> 01:51.561
You did. And I'll tell you

01:51.562 --> 01:53.397
who participates a hell of
a lot in that school.

01:53.398 --> 01:55.694
My checkbook. It participates so much

01:55.695 --> 01:57.531
they should be asking it
to speak at graduation.

01:57.532 --> 01:59.325
Okay, I can see you're
getting real agitated.

01:59.326 --> 02:01.998
Probably because of your
current romantic situation.

02:01.999 --> 02:03.626
I am getting agitated

02:03.627 --> 02:06.089
because of my former romantic situation.

02:06.090 --> 02:07.968
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

02:07.969 --> 02:09.471
Leo, let's go.

02:09.472 --> 02:11.349
- Let me find him a red shirt.
- Please.

02:14.356 --> 02:18.204

02:21.872 --> 02:25.252
Guys, I think my son
might be a genius artist.

02:25.253 --> 02:27.048
- Move over, Banksy.
- Who told you?

02:27.049 --> 02:29.010
I'm not Banksy.

02:29.011 --> 02:32.391
Look at this incredibly cute
drawing he did at school.

02:32.392 --> 02:35.231
- I'm gonna put it on the fridge.
- So when Leo makes a drawing,

02:35.232 --> 02:36.901
it gets prime fridge placement, okay,

02:36.902 --> 02:38.362
but when I try to hang my art,

02:38.363 --> 02:40.366
everyone says it's pornographic?

02:40.367 --> 02:43.205
- Come on, guys.
- Blond hair, blue eyes,

02:43.206 --> 02:44.917
no calzone in her hands.

02:44.918 --> 02:47.004
That's definitely not
a drawing of you, Mindy.

02:47.005 --> 02:49.425
- Hmm?
- In the...

02:49.426 --> 02:51.722
Okay, that's Leo's girlfriend, Daisy.

02:51.723 --> 02:53.433
Have you met this Daisy yet?

02:53.434 --> 02:55.271
I mean, does she come
from a compatible family?

02:55.272 --> 02:57.275
You know, new money? Shouty?

02:57.276 --> 02:59.153
I don't know her.

02:59.154 --> 03:00.824
Maybe I should be spending
more time at Leo's school.

03:00.825 --> 03:02.493
I wouldn't worry about it.

03:02.494 --> 03:04.707
My father was always away
having his affairs

03:04.708 --> 03:06.418
and Mother stayed in her room

03:06.419 --> 03:08.965
talking to her mirror
with the shades drawn,

03:08.966 --> 03:11.303
and I turned out great.

03:11.304 --> 03:12.890
How much of that mug is bourbon?

03:12.891 --> 03:14.894
A mug never tells.

03:18.151 --> 03:20.321
All right, Morgan,

03:20.322 --> 03:22.241
this has been fun,

03:22.242 --> 03:24.245
but we should get back out there.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.957
I feel like people are gonna
start wondering where we are.

03:25.958 --> 03:27.544
Or at least where I am.

03:27.545 --> 03:28.838
Well, maybe we could get some lunch?

03:28.839 --> 03:30.550
My treat. Blood bank called.

03:30.551 --> 03:32.053
They are accepting my donations
once again.

03:32.054 --> 03:33.514
I guess I'm not sick anymore.

03:33.515 --> 03:35.225
Ooh, I don't know about all that.

03:35.226 --> 03:36.896
I feel like us
going out to lunch together

03:36.897 --> 03:38.775
would be too much of, like, a date.

03:38.776 --> 03:40.862
And why can't we go on a date?

03:40.863 --> 03:42.658
I really appreciate you helping me

03:42.659 --> 03:44.662
with my fertility treatments
and helping me grow,

03:44.663 --> 03:46.666
but I think I respect you too much

03:46.667 --> 03:48.335
to continue having sex with you.

03:48.336 --> 03:50.381
Come on! Ugh!

03:50.382 --> 03:52.343
Why does everyone have
to respect me so much?

03:52.344 --> 03:54.389
And if you don't mind,
please don't tell anyone

03:54.390 --> 03:57.103
about any of this.
You know I hate bossip.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.773
Just as much as I love wossip.

03:58.774 --> 04:01.696
All right, real quick.
I get it. I hear you.

04:01.697 --> 04:03.866
Can we still hook up
once in a while on the side?

04:03.867 --> 04:05.202
No, no, that's what I just said.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.457
I don't wanna hook up no more.

04:08.459 --> 04:10.379
Here. Got your lunch.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.049
I ate the fries.

04:12.050 --> 04:14.513
Ooh, my McCafe caramel macchiato.

04:14.514 --> 04:17.267
- Come to mama.
- I mean, do I get one or...?

04:17.269 --> 04:18.980
Well, they were supposed to just be...

04:18.981 --> 04:21.108
- Well, just... okay, thank you.
- Oh, by the way,

04:21.110 --> 04:25.117
there's a hysterical Catholic
woman on the phone for you.

04:25.118 --> 04:28.123
Oh. It's Annette.

04:28.124 --> 04:31.630
Hey, Min, Dot got into
a fight at Cardio Strut.

04:31.631 --> 04:33.760
She thinks she's good enough
to be in the front row,

04:33.761 --> 04:35.471
- but she's not.
- You're just jealous

04:35.472 --> 04:37.266
'cause the teacher gave me
an adjustment.

04:37.267 --> 04:39.312
You're just trying too hard
to look sexy.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.316
- It's not an effort.
- Look.

04:41.317 --> 04:43.696
I am gonna be late for picking up Leo.

04:43.697 --> 04:45.282
You know what, Annette,
I'm gonna pick Leo up today.

04:45.283 --> 04:46.535
I wanna meet this Daisy and make sure

04:46.536 --> 04:48.080
she's not after his money.

04:48.081 --> 04:49.708
Are you sure you know where it is?

04:49.709 --> 04:51.796
Yeah, Annette,
I know the name and address

04:51.797 --> 04:54.301
- of my only son's school.
- All right.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.389
Bleecker Friends
Quaker School for Toddlers.

04:57.390 --> 04:59.143
433 Astor Place.

04:59.144 --> 05:00.730
Thank you, and I pick him up at, what,

05:00.731 --> 05:02.233
like, 7:00 or 8:00 tonight?

05:02.234 --> 05:04.112
2:00. My God.

05:06.283 --> 05:09.998
And we now have a new line
of genetically modified sperm.

05:09.999 --> 05:12.712
We call it Frankensperm.
Not to be confused

05:12.713 --> 05:14.967
with Al Franken's sperm,
which we have a ton of.

05:14.968 --> 05:18.223
I'm actually more interested
in health, college education,

05:18.224 --> 05:20.310
and, if possible, telekinesis ability.

05:20.311 --> 05:23.441
Hmm, I noticed you didn't
say, "Has a big heart"

05:23.442 --> 05:25.947
- or "gap in teeth."
- Shh.

05:25.948 --> 05:27.742
Now, Miss Webb,
would you like for the child

05:27.743 --> 05:29.078
to be able to contact the donor?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.582
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.042
I don't wanna confuse him or her.

05:32.043 --> 05:33.546
Also, I want them to be able to make

05:33.547 --> 05:35.007
a documentary about this one day.

05:35.008 --> 05:37.011
You don't want the kid to meet his dad?

05:37.012 --> 05:38.556
Do you want him to end up like me?

05:38.557 --> 05:41.604
Nah, man, the exact opposite. Shut up.

05:41.605 --> 05:43.315
I don't have time for this.

05:43.316 --> 05:47.072
I have a 3:00 appointment
with a very famous donor.

05:47.073 --> 05:48.868
Robert Durst.

05:48.869 --> 05:50.872
Louis ain't got no time
to deal with this, Morgan.

05:50.873 --> 05:52.792
He's New York's best spermmolier.

05:52.793 --> 05:54.462
I am never doing anything
nice for you ever again.

05:54.463 --> 05:56.049
Just go pick up my laundry.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.428
Nothing would give me more pleasure.

05:58.429 --> 06:00.182
Robert Durst, huh?

06:00.183 --> 06:02.353
I've seen Limp Bizkit
three times in concert.

06:02.354 --> 06:04.357
She means Fred Durst.

06:06.028 --> 06:09.577
Morgan, I know
what's gonna cheer you up.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.709
Folding our briefs. Yeah?

06:13.710 --> 06:15.546
Oh, we are gonna need
more bleach on these.

06:15.547 --> 06:17.550
- That's for sure.
- I don't wanna be cheered up,

06:17.551 --> 06:19.345
Colette. I wanna be sad and left alone.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.727
Anyway. I was doing a load of laundry

06:22.728 --> 06:26.401
and I found this little
gold necklace that says "Diva."

06:26.402 --> 06:29.115
Did some girl you bring over
leave it here?

06:29.116 --> 06:30.743
- It looks familiar.
- Uh, no.

06:30.744 --> 06:33.749
It's a birthday gift for you from me.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.335
Really? I found it in your bedsheets.

06:35.336 --> 06:37.339
I didn't think you were gonna like it,

06:37.340 --> 06:38.801
and I'm gonna return it and
get you something much better.

06:38.802 --> 06:40.095
- Oh, no.
- Okay, okay.

06:40.096 --> 06:41.682
I love it.

06:41.683 --> 06:43.435
I've never thought of myself as a diva,

06:43.436 --> 06:46.316
but now it's the only way I see myself.

06:46.317 --> 06:50.282
- ♪ I'm a diva, I'm a diva, I'm a diva... ♪
- Shh, stop.

06:50.283 --> 06:52.996
Hey, hey, they hate it. They hate it.

06:58.174 --> 07:01.054
Oh, hey, Dr. Ledreau.
What're you doing here?

07:01.055 --> 07:03.349
I'm picking up my son, Sergio.

07:03.350 --> 07:05.395
Your son? Say what?

07:05.396 --> 07:06.982
Oh, did you not know?

07:06.983 --> 07:09.028
I Schwarzenegger'd my cleaning woman.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.911
You have a little kid.
That's so gro... great.

07:12.912 --> 07:14.539
- That's so great.
- Yep.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.960
Best court ordered thing
I've ever had to do.

07:16.961 --> 07:19.633
Sergio, va-ma-nos.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.395
Oh, hey, Leo. Hi, sweetheart.

07:26.396 --> 07:27.941
- How was school today?
- Good.

07:27.942 --> 07:30.278
Good. I wanna meet Daisy.

07:30.279 --> 07:32.742
I wanna see if the girl
lives up to the drawing.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.203
Daisy, Daisy.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.249
Oh, there's my favorite guy!

07:36.250 --> 07:37.627
Coming back for another hug?

07:37.628 --> 07:39.046
How are you?

07:39.047 --> 07:41.342
You're getting so big.

07:41.343 --> 07:43.263
Oh. Oh, hi.

07:43.264 --> 07:44.766
Wait, you're a mom?

07:44.767 --> 07:47.396
You must be Dr. Lahiri's nanny.

07:47.397 --> 07:49.358
I'm Daisy.

07:55.673 --> 07:57.625
Leo, why don't you go get your backpack.

07:57.626 --> 07:59.086
- Thank you.
- Bye.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.620
- Exsqueeze me.
- Mm?

08:00.645 --> 08:03.011
Why does my son refer to you,
an adult woman,

08:03.012 --> 08:05.348
- as his girlfriend?
- I'm so sorry.

08:05.349 --> 08:07.144
Our kids are in the same class here,

08:07.145 --> 08:10.192
and I just... I felt a need
to take Leo under my wing.

08:10.193 --> 08:12.487
I would see him standing there all alone

08:12.488 --> 08:14.868
while all the other kids were
with their parents,

08:14.869 --> 08:17.916
and I... really, it's...
it's been a pleasure.

08:17.917 --> 08:21.088
- He's a very sweet little boy.
- Yeah, I know he's sweet.

08:21.089 --> 08:23.636
I had gestational diabetes
my entire pregnancy.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.432
- Hmm.
- Oh, my God.

08:26.433 --> 08:28.269
- Are you Leo's mom?
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.270 --> 08:29.731
Hi, I'm Ronald,

08:29.732 --> 08:32.152
a stay-at-home father by choice.

08:32.153 --> 08:33.488
I'm Eunice Rhee.

08:33.489 --> 08:35.743
I can't believe you're real.

08:35.744 --> 08:37.246
I know, right?

08:37.246 --> 08:38.582
You are like our Loch Ness Monster.

08:38.582 --> 08:40.544
I am nothing like

08:40.544 --> 08:42.047
the Loch Ness Monster. First of all,

08:42.048 --> 08:43.592
I can't swim. Second of all,

08:43.592 --> 08:45.554
my neck is sort of short and thick.

08:45.555 --> 08:47.725
Although, I have been known
to be blurry in photographs.

08:47.726 --> 08:50.731
I'm... I'm so sorry, Dr. Lahiri.

08:50.732 --> 08:53.069
It's just you're never here
at all, ever.

08:53.070 --> 08:55.950
You're actually the only
parent who hasn't volunteered.

08:55.951 --> 08:58.413
For anything.

08:58.414 --> 09:00.710
Okay, well, you will see me
at the next event.

09:00.711 --> 09:02.129
What is it? Bernie Sanders' birthday?

09:02.130 --> 09:03.757
Navajo Christmas? Sign me up.

09:03.758 --> 09:05.886
Actually, our Japanese sister school,

09:05.887 --> 09:08.391
the Sliding Screen Shinto
School for Pre-Businessmen,

09:08.392 --> 09:10.605
has sent us a beautiful
cherry blossom tree

09:10.606 --> 09:12.482
to plant on the grounds.

09:12.483 --> 09:14.111
I'm sorry... and people
actually wanna come to that?

09:14.112 --> 09:16.490
Oh, yeah.

09:16.491 --> 09:18.411
Because I definitely want to.

09:18.412 --> 09:20.415
I'm sure I'll gain in memories with Leo

09:20.416 --> 09:22.294
what I lose in lucrative billable hours.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.631
That is wonderful.

09:23.632 --> 09:25.133
The ceremony is tomorrow at 11:00,

09:25.134 --> 09:26.970
and you need to bring a homemade snack

09:26.971 --> 09:28.932
- for the whole school.
- Yeah, now some of the kids

09:28.933 --> 09:31.395
can't eat peanuts,
but they can eat tree nuts.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.316
But none of the kids can eat tree nuts

09:33.317 --> 09:34.819
if it's mixed with gluten.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.322
However, one kid, Joey,

09:36.323 --> 09:38.744
- must have gluten or he'll die.
- Great.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.915
Well, I love that
Leo goes to school here,

09:40.916 --> 09:43.086
it was great meeting the three of you,

09:43.087 --> 09:45.841
I'm a good mom, I will see you tomorrow.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.181
Where is my son?

09:53.399 --> 09:55.778
♪ To the ah tick tock get up stop ♪

09:55.779 --> 09:58.282
♪ To the ah tick tock get up stop ♪

09:58.283 --> 10:00.705
♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ♪

10:00.706 --> 10:03.000
♪ I'm gonna knock you up ♪

10:03.001 --> 10:04.169
Did I wait here for 20 minutes

10:04.170 --> 10:05.715
while you thought that up?

10:05.716 --> 10:08.637
Tamra, today is your insemination day.

10:08.638 --> 10:11.685
Get ready for nine whole months
of total strangers

10:11.686 --> 10:14.148
feeling entitled to rub your stomach.

10:14.149 --> 10:16.987
Now all we have to do
is one last ultrasound,

10:16.988 --> 10:18.741
to make sure that your eggs

10:18.742 --> 10:20.995
are ripe and juicy for the plucking.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.414
You better stop.
You're being hella noony

10:22.415 --> 10:24.084
and I don't like it.

10:24.085 --> 10:26.005
If my child grows up
to pronounce "sensual"

10:26.006 --> 10:28.635
sen-su-al, I'm gonna sue you.

10:28.636 --> 10:30.473
Of course.

10:32.644 --> 10:35.941
Tamra, you have a gorgeous uterus.

10:35.942 --> 10:37.737
Oh, no.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.532
Looks like there's a sesame
seed on the screen.

10:39.533 --> 10:41.035
I had a bagel earlier.

10:41.036 --> 10:43.373
It must have flown off in the ravaging.

10:44.835 --> 10:47.130
That's not a sesame seed.

10:47.131 --> 10:48.884
That's a baby.

10:48.885 --> 10:50.721
Tamra, you're already pregnant.

10:55.439 --> 10:57.985
Hello, Tamra. My women's rugby team

10:57.986 --> 10:59.697
is selling these candy bars

10:59.698 --> 11:02.410
to help send us
to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.914
Not to play. Just to hook up.

11:05.544 --> 11:08.256
Tamra, can you answer me?
I'm a human being.

11:08.257 --> 11:09.843
Can't you see I'm reeling right now?

11:09.844 --> 11:11.555
My poke bowl is untouched.

11:11.556 --> 11:14.811
Ugh, everyone's
in such a bad mood these days.

11:14.812 --> 11:18.317
Morgan, you, Sean Hannity,
the entire gay community.

11:18.318 --> 11:20.865
Sorry, Colette,
I just have a lot on my mind.

11:20.866 --> 11:22.450
Well, do you wanna talk about it?

11:22.451 --> 11:24.246
I wanna talk about why you're wearing

11:24.247 --> 11:25.541
my diva necklace.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.503
Huh? This is mine.

11:27.504 --> 11:29.089
Morgan gave it to me for my birthday.

11:29.090 --> 11:30.760
I found it in his bedsheets.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.899
You know, maybe I didn't find it

11:37.900 --> 11:40.486
in the... his sheets.

11:40.487 --> 11:42.073
No. Maybe I found 'em in, like...

11:42.074 --> 11:44.871
The streets.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.167
Anyway, uh, good luck

11:47.168 --> 11:48.879
with your football thing or whatever.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.841
Bye.

11:50.842 --> 11:52.177
Bossip.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.680
Hey, Jeremy, I have to go to

11:53.681 --> 11:55.475
that stupid tree event at Leo's school,

11:55.476 --> 11:57.437
so can you please bring in
the homemade snacks?

11:57.438 --> 11:59.525
And please, please let them be good.

12:01.029 --> 12:02.740
Now, for all the food restrictions,

12:02.741 --> 12:04.409
I think I rather outdid myself.

12:04.410 --> 12:07.290
They are meringues
in the exact same color

12:07.291 --> 12:10.380
as the famed Japanese cherry blossom.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.175
<i>Oishi.</i>

12:12.176 --> 12:15.098
400 egg whites, my right hand
has gone to gnarl,

12:15.099 --> 12:17.812
but to see the looks
on those children's faces, oh...

12:17.813 --> 12:20.274
Jeremy, you can't come.

12:20.275 --> 12:22.362
I'm sorry, but today is about me

12:22.363 --> 12:24.491
and taking credit for your work.

12:24.492 --> 12:26.955
Unless, of course, one of those
cookies gets a kid sick.

12:26.956 --> 12:30.003
In which case,
you will probably go to jail.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:40.107 --> 12:41.901
Hey, Daisy, what's up?

12:41.902 --> 12:44.406
We are so looking forward
to seeing you today.

12:44.407 --> 12:46.410
Leo just said, "I hope she shows up"

12:46.411 --> 12:48.164
with the cutest little worried look.

12:48.165 --> 12:49.876
Well, you can tell him
that I will be there.

12:49.877 --> 12:51.546
I don't wanna tell him something

12:51.547 --> 12:54.844
- that might not be true.
- I will be there!

12:54.845 --> 12:56.973
Oh, my God, Dr. L. I need to see you.

12:56.974 --> 12:58.476
- It's an emergency.
- No, no, no.

12:58.477 --> 12:59.854
I have something at my kid's school.

12:59.855 --> 13:01.315
No, it's a medical emergency

13:01.316 --> 13:03.194
that we need to deal with right now.

13:03.195 --> 13:06.075
Okay, okay, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.001
- What is it?
- I need you to act like

13:11.002 --> 13:12.797
you're going along
with the insemination.

13:12.798 --> 13:15.468
What? Why? You're already pregnant.

13:15.469 --> 13:17.222
Oh, you can't get twins this way.

13:17.223 --> 13:18.975
That only works for cats and the Irish.

13:18.976 --> 13:21.396
I don't want twins.
Beyoncé owns that now.

13:21.397 --> 13:23.484
I need plausible deniability.

13:23.485 --> 13:26.281
I don't want the dad to know.
He is not father material.

13:26.282 --> 13:28.369
Look, one day, you might be happy

13:28.370 --> 13:29.956
that the father is involved.

13:29.957 --> 13:32.043
Danny and I certainly have our issues,

13:32.044 --> 13:34.507
but I'm glad he's around.
He's the only reason Leo knows

13:34.508 --> 13:36.468
- how to toss pizza dough.
- Please, Dr. L.

13:36.469 --> 13:37.930
You just have to trust me

13:37.931 --> 13:39.474
that it's best for me and my baby

13:39.475 --> 13:41.270
if the dad doesn't know.

13:41.271 --> 13:42.940
Is it Marco Rubio?

13:42.941 --> 13:44.610
Terrence Howard? Ron Howard?

13:44.611 --> 13:45.946
Just stop. You'll never guess.

13:45.947 --> 13:47.783
I'll never guess.

13:47.784 --> 13:50.539
- It's not Rumpelstiltskin.
- It's not Rumpelstiltskin.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.960
Okay, well, I promise you.
I will keep your secret.

13:52.961 --> 13:54.839
Oh, thank you.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.093
Now I gotta go to
a schoolyard and plant a tree.

13:57.094 --> 13:58.805
Is that a euphemism
for going to the bathroom?

13:58.806 --> 14:00.601
For once, no.

14:07.657 --> 14:10.286
Oh, Dr. Ledreau! Dr. Ledreau!

14:10.287 --> 14:11.998
Is it over? Did I miss it?

14:11.999 --> 14:14.169
Oh, yeah, everything,
and I've never seen

14:14.170 --> 14:16.006
a more beautiful tree.

14:16.007 --> 14:18.344
Sergio, we're out of here, bro.

14:18.345 --> 14:19.931
Oh, God.

14:19.932 --> 14:23.187
Look who decided to finally show up.

14:23.188 --> 14:25.817
You know, the kids were
starving without their snacks.

14:25.818 --> 14:28.531
We lied and told them it was
Ramadan and we were fasting

14:28.532 --> 14:30.242
so at least it could be
a teachable moment.

14:30.243 --> 14:32.205
- Is that your snack?
- It is.

14:32.206 --> 14:35.169
It's actually traditional
curly Indian bread.

14:35.170 --> 14:36.881
That's very important

14:36.882 --> 14:39.469
because it is both delicious
and religious.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.933
This is a soft pretzel from
the cart on the street corner.

14:41.934 --> 14:43.520
And it looks like
the salt has been licked off.

14:43.521 --> 14:45.356
Oh, that's disgusting.

14:45.357 --> 14:47.528
Hey, why are all the kids
dressed up like trees?

14:47.529 --> 14:49.782
You were supposed to dress Leo up.

14:49.783 --> 14:51.661
- It was in the email.
- The email?

14:51.662 --> 14:54.583
Okay, so was a 5,000-word
remembrance of August Wilson.

14:54.584 --> 14:57.840
- I don't have time to read that.
- "Fences" changed my life.

14:57.841 --> 15:01.848
Not only did you not
do a costume for your child,

15:01.849 --> 15:03.768
you put him in a T-shirt featuring

15:03.769 --> 15:06.232
the mortal enemy of the tree.
The beaver.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.412
- That's bad. That's awful.
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.917
And I am very sorry.
Just, guys, please forgive me.

15:15.918 --> 15:17.336
I just got caught up at work.

15:17.337 --> 15:18.673
Something really important came up.

15:18.674 --> 15:20.635
We get it. We all have jobs.

15:20.636 --> 15:22.305
My job is to not have a job

15:22.306 --> 15:23.892
so that I can be there for my child,

15:23.893 --> 15:26.606
but recently, a lot of my work

15:26.607 --> 15:28.693
has been raising your child for you.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.530
Exsqueeze me, bish?

15:30.531 --> 15:33.160
I'm sorry that you're
so obsessed with my son.

15:33.161 --> 15:34.747
Maybe it's 'cause your stupid kid

15:34.748 --> 15:36.124
isn't giving you what you need at home.

15:36.125 --> 15:38.337
I'm talking hugs, son.

15:40.425 --> 15:43.305
Oh, no you did not.

15:43.306 --> 15:46.228
No. You know what? You're not worth it.

15:46.229 --> 15:47.313
Hmm.

15:49.276 --> 15:51.113
- Whoa!
- Look out, the tree!

15:57.148 --> 15:58.906
I wanted you to get
more involved in school,

15:58.931 --> 16:00.711
not punch a lady and destroy a tree.

16:00.736 --> 16:03.387
Okay, to be fair,
you never explicitly said that.

16:03.388 --> 16:05.224
Also, I was provoked,

16:05.225 --> 16:07.061
but you know what, she's blonde,

16:07.062 --> 16:08.773
so you would have loved her,
probably married her,

16:08.774 --> 16:10.652
- then divorced her.
- Annulled her,

16:10.653 --> 16:12.446
and I wouldn't, okay?
I don't date women with kids.

16:12.447 --> 16:15.494
- I don't need the hassle.
- Dr. Lahiri,

16:15.495 --> 16:18.835
to be honest, I am not surprised

16:18.836 --> 16:21.381
by seeing you in my office again.

16:21.382 --> 16:23.177
You know, Dr. Green,
I find it interesting

16:23.178 --> 16:25.097
that you singled out the parent of color

16:25.098 --> 16:26.976
simply because she hits people.

16:26.977 --> 16:29.439
I just got off the phone
with the Japanese Embassy.

16:29.440 --> 16:32.403
They feel so dishonored
by our actions today,

16:32.404 --> 16:34.909
they cut down the tree that we sent them

16:34.910 --> 16:37.330
- with a sword.
- Ah, not the syrup maple.

16:37.331 --> 16:38.958
The syrup maple? I picked that out

16:38.959 --> 16:40.712
- at the Garden Center.
- Okay, I agree.

16:40.713 --> 16:43.551
This is horrible.
You know what else is horrible?

16:43.552 --> 16:46.515
Getting shoved by Daisy Anderson

16:46.516 --> 16:48.728
- after she bullied my snacks.
- Dr. Lahiri,

16:48.729 --> 16:50.147
we all know that you're going through

16:50.148 --> 16:52.653
some very personal problems lately.

16:52.654 --> 16:54.405
Is this my divorce? He's going through

16:54.406 --> 16:56.869
- the same thing.
- Yes, and yet, Dr. Castellano

16:56.870 --> 16:58.330
is handling it quite beautifully.

16:58.331 --> 17:00.209
He's even found time to chaperone

17:00.210 --> 17:03.006
our Central Park Acorn Cleanup.

17:03.007 --> 17:05.762
Okay, yes, Danny has
been handling it very well.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.348
He's a model parent.

17:07.348 --> 17:10.186
You could learn from his example.

17:10.188 --> 17:13.402
I guess it's possible
I've let my personal issues

17:13.403 --> 17:15.656
- affect my child's life.
- The good news is

17:15.657 --> 17:17.661
that children are resilient.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.583
They can overcome anything.
Even absentee mothers.

17:20.584 --> 17:22.838
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's...
that's a lot.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.717
Okay, I think you're being unfair here.

17:24.718 --> 17:28.098
Now, Mindy and I,
we're both doctors, okay.

17:28.098 --> 17:30.603
- Real doctors.
- I have a PhD

17:30.604 --> 17:32.440
in interior design from RISD.

17:32.441 --> 17:34.068
Great. That's great. Good for you.

17:34.069 --> 17:36.281
But this woman here,
she still makes time

17:36.282 --> 17:38.620
to make breakfast for her son
every morning

17:38.621 --> 17:40.331
or sing him to sleep every night.

17:40.332 --> 17:42.251
I mean, how many preschoolers
do you know

17:42.252 --> 17:43.963
that know all the words
to Taylor Swift's "Red" album?

17:43.964 --> 17:47.387
Mindy is a great role model to our son.

17:49.308 --> 17:51.896
And being a good mother, it means more

17:51.897 --> 17:53.775
than just volunteering at school,

17:53.776 --> 17:56.154
and by the way, the parents do
an awful lot around here.

17:56.155 --> 17:58.618
- What're we paying you to do?
- I do a lot.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.206
Fundraising, composing newsletters.

18:01.207 --> 18:02.918
Okay, I think we're done here.

18:02.919 --> 18:06.007
I gotta get back to work,
and so does she.

18:08.471 --> 18:10.892
Hey, today was
your insemination day, right?

18:10.893 --> 18:12.979
Sure was, and it went great.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.317
I can already feel things
heating up down there.

18:15.318 --> 18:17.989
- Mmm.
- Well, I got you these flowers

18:17.990 --> 18:21.246
- to say congratulations.
- Thank you, Morgan.

18:21.247 --> 18:23.250
This is so sweet.

18:23.251 --> 18:25.797
You know, Sheena only got me
a copy of "Rosemary's Baby"

18:25.798 --> 18:28.636
with a note saying, "This is
the best-case scenario."

18:28.637 --> 18:32.393
Tam, I'm sorry about
the way I acted before.

18:32.394 --> 18:35.482
I was just jealous of whoever

18:35.483 --> 18:39.115
gets to share something
so special with you.

18:39.116 --> 18:40.869
I shouldn't have said anything.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.041
It's your business.

18:44.042 --> 18:47.381
Any kid would be lucky
to have you as a mom.

18:47.382 --> 18:49.845
Morgan, I have to tell you something.

18:53.060 --> 18:54.437
That means a lot.

18:58.989 --> 19:00.700
- Should I close the door?
- No.

19:00.701 --> 19:02.829
- Morgan, no.
- Happy Thursday.

19:02.830 --> 19:04.290
- Happy Thursday.
- Yeah.

19:07.422 --> 19:09.510
Bossip.

19:12.140 --> 19:13.643
Aah! Please don't hit me.

19:13.644 --> 19:15.312
Or if you do, just hit me on the lips,

19:15.313 --> 19:16.524
'cause they're already numb
from injectables.

19:16.525 --> 19:17.692
Calm down, Mindy.

19:17.693 --> 19:19.111
I'm not here to hit you.

19:19.112 --> 19:22.076
I'm here... to apologize.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.372
- Apologize to me?
- Mm.

19:24.373 --> 19:27.044
Daisy, you know that
I left an acrylic in your cheek

19:27.045 --> 19:28.255
from when I clawed you?

19:28.256 --> 19:29.465
Yes, I...

19:29.466 --> 19:30.718
I'm very sorry

19:30.719 --> 19:33.014
that I snapped at you earlier.

19:33.015 --> 19:34.601
It's just, sometimes the pressure

19:34.602 --> 19:37.774
of being a perfect parent
is just so great.

19:37.775 --> 19:40.279
You know, we can't all be Ivanka Trump.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.617
I know, I'd be way in
over my head at G20.

19:42.618 --> 19:44.788
That's a video game conference, right?

19:44.789 --> 19:46.625
Anyway...

19:46.626 --> 19:48.295
I'm... I'm sorry.

19:48.296 --> 19:50.007
Yeah, me too.

19:50.008 --> 19:53.430
And I should thank you
for taking such good care

19:53.431 --> 19:55.560
of my son when I'm not able to.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.146
Thank you.

19:57.147 --> 19:58.691
I think sometimes I'm just jealous

19:58.692 --> 20:00.485
of the working moms.

20:00.486 --> 20:03.491
I used to love my job so much.

20:03.492 --> 20:05.495
I was a lawyer
for the Justice Department.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.082
- What? Oh, my God.
- Mm-hmm.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.836
Is that as cool as it is in the movies?

20:08.837 --> 20:10.255
I mostly just helped
the Bush Administration

20:10.256 --> 20:12.009
justify their torture policies.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.930
Oh, my God. "24" is my favorite show.

20:13.931 --> 20:15.474
Did you see "Zero Dark Thirty"?

20:15.475 --> 20:18.564
- Yeah.
- Jessica Chastain played me.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.484
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

20:20.485 --> 20:21.820
She blocked me on Twitter.

20:29.378 --> 20:31.130
I'm so behind on my reality TV.

20:31.131 --> 20:33.093
I can't remember which one
of these bitches I hate.

20:33.094 --> 20:34.261
Oh, thank God, Task Rabbit,

20:34.262 --> 20:35.890
you're finally here.

20:35.891 --> 20:37.226
Can you please get me a soda
from the fridge?

20:37.227 --> 20:38.353
I'm too lazy to stand.

20:38.354 --> 20:39.940
Soda's bad for you.

20:39.941 --> 20:41.902
You should only drink alkaline water.

20:41.903 --> 20:44.490
Danny.

20:44.491 --> 20:47.496
Is that a pizza from Vincenzo's
in Staten Island?

20:47.497 --> 20:49.000
I've always wanted to try it,

20:49.001 --> 20:50.586
but they only serve white people.

20:50.587 --> 20:52.047
Just figured, after a stressful day

20:52.048 --> 20:54.260
you might want some pizza.

20:54.261 --> 20:56.598
I wanted to say that I really appreciate

20:56.599 --> 20:59.311
what you said to Dr. Green today.

20:59.312 --> 21:01.315
You know, it's kind of nice knowing that

21:01.316 --> 21:02.986
you think I'm the greatest mom
in the history of the world.

21:02.987 --> 21:04.238
I didn't say that.

21:04.239 --> 21:06.075
But I did mean what I did say.

21:06.076 --> 21:08.706
I don't like that Dr. Green guy.

21:08.707 --> 21:10.626
I don't think
his glasses are prescription.

21:10.627 --> 21:12.672
Hm. But hey.

21:12.673 --> 21:14.133
Now that I'm going through a divorce,

21:14.134 --> 21:15.636
can I just say? It sucks.

21:15.637 --> 21:17.181
I'm really sorry.

21:17.182 --> 21:18.809
Yeah, well, I thought the second time

21:18.810 --> 21:20.855
would be easier, but nope.

21:20.856 --> 21:22.859
Just more expensive.

21:22.860 --> 21:24.236
Maybe I should have been a priest

21:24.237 --> 21:26.449
like that career test said.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.579
You do love talking to old ladies.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.666
Butter, ketchup...

21:30.667 --> 21:33.171
and a bra?

21:33.172 --> 21:34.966
How am I supposed to
make a salad with this?

21:34.967 --> 21:36.512
What? Why would you ruin

21:36.513 --> 21:38.682
a perfectly good pizza with a salad?

21:38.683 --> 21:40.561
How are you still alive?

21:40.562 --> 21:42.397
I am very healthy.

21:42.398 --> 21:44.611
This is only the second time
I've had pizza today.

21:44.612 --> 21:46.489
Okay. Here we go.

21:46.490 --> 21:49.411
Oh, man, those racists make
a good slice of pizza.

21:49.412 --> 21:51.625
They're not racist.
They're old-fashioned.

21:51.626 --> 21:53.629
Same thing.

21:53.630 --> 21:55.216
Mmm.
