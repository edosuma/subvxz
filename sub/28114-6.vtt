00:04.829 --> 00:06.829
Mom?

00:06.863 --> 00:09.130
-Hmm?
-A guy had to cut off his penis

00:09.164 --> 00:10.797
because he got his dick
stuck in a jar.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.197
Don't tell me that.

00:12.230 --> 00:13.364
He was 50 years old.

00:13.397 --> 00:15.131
Why?

00:15.165 --> 00:16.530
Mom.

00:16.564 --> 00:18.165
Come on.

00:18.198 --> 00:20.465
Well... did he die?

00:20.498 --> 00:22.131
I don't know.

00:22.165 --> 00:24.132
- Ugh.
- Mom?

00:24.165 --> 00:26.299
Remember I told you
Paisley's dating this,

00:26.332 --> 00:27.698
like, 70-year-old guy?

00:27.731 --> 00:29.299
-Yeah?
-Well,

00:29.332 --> 00:30.965
he won't have
sex with her until she's...

00:30.998 --> 00:32.866
Oh, thank God!

00:32.899 --> 00:35.499
Mom, you didn't let me finish.

00:35.532 --> 00:37.300
Oh.

00:37.333 --> 00:41.467
He won't have sex with her
until she turns 21?

00:41.500 --> 00:44.467
She asked hopefully
in a very high voice.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.833
No he won't have sex with her
unless she's, like,

00:46.867 --> 00:49.533
completely shaved,
like, completely.

00:49.567 --> 00:52.634
Max, do you mind?
Duke is sitting right there.

00:52.668 --> 00:54.468
What?
I can know about it.

00:54.501 --> 00:56.135
- It's fine.
- AllÃ´.

00:56.168 --> 00:57.301
C'est moi.

01:27.871 --> 01:29.337
A Certain Age, $800.

01:29.371 --> 01:31.637
A common Jewish surname.

01:31.671 --> 01:33.004
It's German for "black."

01:33.038 --> 01:34.305
-What is Schwartz?!
-Schvartze!

01:34.338 --> 01:35.538
- Schwartz.
- Correct.

01:35.572 --> 01:37.805
All
In The Family, 2,000.

01:37.838 --> 01:40.139
In the King James
Bible, these three words

01:40.173 --> 01:41.838
starting with a relative,

01:41.872 --> 01:44.139
precede "for they know not
what they do."

01:44.173 --> 01:45.805
-What is "Father forgive them?"
-"Father forgive them!"

01:45.838 --> 01:47.639
What is "Father, forgive them?"

01:47.673 --> 01:50.373
Right. Magic and
sorcery in the Bible for eight.

01:50.406 --> 01:53.507
This Babylonian king had
his own group of magicians,

01:53.539 --> 01:56.640
but it was Daniel
who interpreted his dreams.

01:56.674 --> 01:58.674
-Who is Nebuchadnezzar?
-Nebuchadnezzar.

01:58.707 --> 02:01.041
- Yes.
- Good. We both won.

02:01.075 --> 02:02.974
No, you didn't win,
because you didn't

02:03.007 --> 02:04.475
put it in the form
of a question.

02:11.575 --> 02:14.008
-Oh, thank you.
-You're welcome.

02:14.042 --> 02:15.509
Is it good?

02:15.542 --> 02:18.042
-Yeah.
-So, these boys asked me

02:18.076 --> 02:19.376
to do a photo shoot for like,

02:19.409 --> 02:21.142
- their rehab group or...
- Mm-hmm.

02:21.176 --> 02:22.209
some kind of bullshit,

02:22.242 --> 02:24.310
and, um, they asked me to invite

02:24.343 --> 02:25.876
my girlfriends,
and it turns out

02:25.909 --> 02:28.710
they were just trying to get me
to take naked pictures of them.

02:28.743 --> 02:31.977
And they thought because I was
shooting it, it would be okay.

02:32.010 --> 02:33.310
The fuck?

02:33.343 --> 02:34.810
So stupid.

02:34.843 --> 02:36.810
Well, boys will be boys.

02:36.843 --> 02:39.344
They certainly know
how to take any advantage

02:39.378 --> 02:41.644
to gawp at young girls' bosoms.

02:41.678 --> 02:42.811
It's so childish.

02:44.212 --> 02:46.079
Why did you leave my dad?

02:48.179 --> 02:49.345
What?

02:49.379 --> 02:50.879
Frankie, shut up.

02:50.911 --> 02:52.545
No.

02:52.579 --> 02:54.080
Why did you leave my dad?

02:58.180 --> 03:00.979
Frankie, that was
a long time ago.

03:01.012 --> 03:02.813
Well, yeah,
but you never told us.

03:02.846 --> 03:04.480
You-you never told us.
You...

03:04.513 --> 03:07.013
you sat us down
and gave us that bullshit talk

03:07.047 --> 03:09.013
and then we all went
to the movies.

03:09.047 --> 03:11.514
But you never told us why.

03:13.681 --> 03:15.647
It's true, Mom.

03:15.681 --> 03:17.714
You never told us.

03:24.248 --> 03:26.215
Did your father
say something to you

03:26.248 --> 03:27.982
when you saw him on Tuesday?

03:28.015 --> 03:31.015
This is not about
what my father said to me.

03:31.049 --> 03:33.349
This is about
what you haven't said to me.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.883
Why did you leave my dad?

03:46.184 --> 03:48.484
Oh, I beg your pardon.

03:48.517 --> 03:50.850
I've made a pong.
Uh-oh.

03:52.017 --> 03:53.151
Oh.

03:54.518 --> 03:56.318
Gran.

03:56.351 --> 03:59.685
Oh, okay. Gross.

03:59.718 --> 04:02.352
Goodness me.

04:13.187 --> 04:14.852
Thanks, Mom.

04:14.886 --> 04:16.986
No problem.

04:27.020 --> 04:28.254
Okay.

04:30.254 --> 04:31.988
Yeah.

04:32.021 --> 04:35.222
No, I'm not okay, but...

04:35.255 --> 04:36.689
Bye.

04:38.189 --> 04:39.555
I don't know what
you want me to say.

04:56.524 --> 04:58.824
Hi.
How are you?

04:58.857 --> 05:01.524
-How you doing?
-I'm okay.

05:04.058 --> 05:05.657
What's wrong?

05:05.691 --> 05:07.058
Why you cry?

05:09.092 --> 05:10.825
Doesn't matter.

05:10.858 --> 05:12.225
I just...

05:12.258 --> 05:13.858
Bleh.

05:15.558 --> 05:17.059
What were you doing today?

05:17.093 --> 05:19.226
Hmm.

05:19.259 --> 05:22.359
Well, I have therapy.

05:22.393 --> 05:23.659
Yep.

05:23.693 --> 05:25.227
Yep, I do.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.659
I have doctor
medical prescribed

05:27.693 --> 05:29.594
mental therapy.

05:30.727 --> 05:33.160
Good, Mom.
You need it.

05:33.194 --> 05:35.994
Oh, thank you so much.

05:36.027 --> 05:37.994
What are you gonna do today?

05:38.027 --> 05:40.894
I... don't know.

05:40.927 --> 05:43.561
I'm supposed
to see a show tonight.

05:43.595 --> 05:44.861
I'm shooting a band.

05:44.895 --> 05:46.196
Cool.

05:48.928 --> 05:51.729
-Can I borrow your boots?
-Nope. Absolutely not.

05:51.762 --> 05:53.229
-Mom!
-No, you can't.

05:53.262 --> 05:55.529
Mom, they're just gonna
stay in your closet.

05:55.562 --> 05:58.230
-Please, please, can I borrow the boots?
-Nope. No.

05:58.263 --> 06:00.430
No, you can't, honey.

06:05.363 --> 06:07.697
What's wrong?

06:10.198 --> 06:12.997
My boyfriend broke up with me.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.764
Oh.

06:16.698 --> 06:18.031
Which one?

06:18.065 --> 06:21.199
Um, the black ones
with the roses.

06:21.232 --> 06:23.099
No, I meant which boyfriend.

06:26.032 --> 06:28.399
Okay, that's
really funny, Mom.

06:28.432 --> 06:31.566
Now I feel bad
about myself again.

06:37.366 --> 06:40.566
Come on.
Come on.

06:56.068 --> 06:57.368
Turn around.

06:57.402 --> 06:59.368
Turn around, turn away.

06:59.402 --> 07:01.169
-Turn away.
-Why do you have that?

07:01.203 --> 07:03.668
It's so weird you keep your
fucking boots in a safe.

07:07.203 --> 07:09.403
Oh, what about those?
Can I have those?

07:09.436 --> 07:11.403
No! No, no, no, no.

07:11.436 --> 07:13.669
You absolutely can't, no.
No, honey.

07:13.703 --> 07:15.204
You know why?

07:15.237 --> 07:17.870
My grandmother
left me a gold bracelet,

07:17.904 --> 07:21.205
I had a rare book
and a ruby ring,

07:21.237 --> 07:23.504
and you know what?
They're all gone.

07:23.537 --> 07:24.737
They're all gone.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.171
You guys just take it.

07:26.205 --> 07:28.705
You take away things.
So...

07:30.705 --> 07:33.705
Go ahead.
Take these boots.

07:33.738 --> 07:35.372
I'm never gonna see 'em again.

07:35.406 --> 07:39.239
But I am keeping these boots.

07:39.272 --> 07:41.073
And my safe.

07:44.107 --> 07:45.373
You're welcome.

07:47.073 --> 07:49.673
Can we go out?
Can we get tacos?

07:49.707 --> 07:52.007
Didn't you hear
what I was singing before?

07:52.040 --> 07:55.540
I'm the fatty, patty,
patty, patty, fatty man.

07:55.573 --> 07:58.040
Duh. Yes.

07:58.074 --> 07:59.873
-Okay.
-Tacos.

08:06.908 --> 08:09.041
Seriously?
I could...

08:09.075 --> 08:10.509
climb over the...

08:12.209 --> 08:13.942
Okay.

08:26.244 --> 08:29.244
Well, this kind of stress
at home is very common.

08:29.277 --> 08:31.511
Oh, really? Is it?
Is this common?

08:31.544 --> 08:34.677
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber,

08:34.711 --> 08:37.577
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber,
Lyft, Lyft,

08:37.611 --> 08:39.378
Postmates, Venmo,

08:39.412 --> 08:41.578
Spotify, Instafollow,

08:41.611 --> 08:43.578
Lyft, Uber, Uber, Uber,

08:43.611 --> 08:45.678
Uber, Uber, Lyft,

08:45.712 --> 08:48.412
Postmates, Postmates,
Editing Bunny.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.712
I don't know...
why this makes me so angry.

08:53.213 --> 08:55.013
I know they have to get places

08:55.045 --> 08:57.013
and I can't be everywhere.

08:57.046 --> 08:59.513
I just... I-I...

08:59.546 --> 09:01.013
It... When I see it

09:01.046 --> 09:03.879
in this big, giant, pile

09:03.913 --> 09:06.547
of turd money bullshit...

09:06.580 --> 09:08.680
I need somebody to weigh in.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.515
Like, is this okay?
Is this how people are doing it?

09:12.548 --> 09:14.848
Or am I completely
screwing everything up?

09:14.880 --> 09:16.848
Yes.

09:16.881 --> 09:18.848
"There are no strangers here,

09:18.881 --> 09:20.881
only friends we have not met."

09:49.551 --> 09:51.718
I guess it really
has been that long.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.253
-Hoh...
-Yeah, you see that?

10:06.286 --> 10:08.886
I knew I wasn't that
forgettable.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.553
Blowing your mind a little bit?

10:14.121 --> 10:15.586
A little bit.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.421
Yeah.

10:17.454 --> 10:19.287
Hi.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.089
Little Deezy Miller.

10:32.122 --> 10:34.855
And now Dr. Little Deezy Miller.

10:34.888 --> 10:37.223
But I'll take David
from my old camp buddy.

10:37.256 --> 10:39.456
Oh. Okay.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.023
What?
We weren't buddies?

10:42.055 --> 10:44.389
Oh, no, I don't know.

10:44.423 --> 10:46.856
I mean, is that
what you call every girl

10:46.889 --> 10:48.689
you went behind
the infirmary with?

10:48.723 --> 10:52.224
You are every girl I went
behind the infirmary with.

11:03.225 --> 11:05.192
I was red team.
60s?

11:05.225 --> 11:08.058
Oh, God, that's right.
Yeah, and you wore that, uh,

11:08.092 --> 11:10.426
Led Zeppelin shirt
with the sleeves cut off

11:10.459 --> 11:12.259
for that whole week.

11:12.292 --> 11:14.392
You were so cute.
God, you killed me.

11:17.926 --> 11:21.026
So...

11:21.059 --> 11:23.026
still got that shirt?

11:28.094 --> 11:30.094
Yes!

11:39.262 --> 11:41.229
What happened?

11:41.262 --> 11:44.362
You've been playing in the
street again is what happened.

11:44.395 --> 11:47.262
No, I... I wasn't, I...

11:47.295 --> 11:49.029
If your mother finds out

11:49.062 --> 11:50.430
you've been playing
in the street again,

11:50.462 --> 11:52.363
you're gonna
be in a lot of trouble.

11:52.396 --> 11:54.696
I don't feel good.

11:54.730 --> 11:57.063
All right. Come on.
You're fine.

11:57.096 --> 11:58.896
Just a little shaken up.

11:58.930 --> 12:00.463
How many fingers?

12:01.464 --> 12:02.863
Three.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.197
Good girl. All right.

12:05.231 --> 12:07.063
Need a little lie down is all.

12:07.097 --> 12:10.597
Now, get yourself back in
and get cleaned up

12:10.631 --> 12:12.531
before your mother catches you.

12:12.564 --> 12:14.698
Okay.
Wait, where's my skateboard?

12:14.731 --> 12:16.232
Go.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.700
We should probably talk
about you at some point.

12:38.734 --> 12:41.034
Mm-hmm. Sure. Yeah.

12:41.067 --> 12:44.700
Or, I don't know, you could
maybe just give me the drugs.

12:44.734 --> 12:47.201
Dr. Babu said that you would
try to shake me down.

12:47.235 --> 12:49.435
But so far all I know is either

12:49.468 --> 12:51.601
somebody stole your credit card

12:51.635 --> 12:54.202
or, um, you have
a teenager at home.

12:54.236 --> 12:56.602
Two, and a younger.

12:56.636 --> 12:58.068
And you think that
they're contributing

12:58.102 --> 12:59.702
to your sleep issues?

12:59.736 --> 13:03.869
No. No.
They don't keep me up anymore.

13:03.902 --> 13:06.403
I don't even fall asleep,
I just pass out.

13:07.437 --> 13:09.270
All right.

13:12.603 --> 13:13.603
Ugh.

13:13.637 --> 13:15.737
Ugh!

13:19.471 --> 13:21.538
I keep...

13:21.571 --> 13:25.205
I keep having these
dreams that I'm constantly

13:25.239 --> 13:28.105
getting sexed on by my ex,

13:28.139 --> 13:31.038
and it's happening
very frequently,

13:31.071 --> 13:33.705
meaning every single night.

13:33.739 --> 13:35.372
How long since the divorce?

13:35.405 --> 13:38.573
Uh, it's been, like,
four or five hundred years.

13:38.605 --> 13:40.805
So was it an amicable split?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.440
Um... jeesh,

13:43.473 --> 13:44.773
I don't want to...

13:44.806 --> 13:46.440
I don't...

13:46.473 --> 13:49.040
Well, we don't have to
get into that right now.

13:49.073 --> 13:53.040
But I will say that even after
a contentious relationship,

13:53.073 --> 13:54.907
there can be residual feelings

13:54.941 --> 13:57.208
-No. No. No. No.
-that have to be dealt with.

13:57.242 --> 13:59.208
-Otherwise they can
continue to fester -Nope.

13:59.242 --> 14:02.041
-beneath the surface.
-No. Nope. Wrong. Wrong.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.074
Sorry, that's stupid.

14:05.575 --> 14:08.442
If your ex-husband
was here right now,

14:08.475 --> 14:10.209
what would you say to him?

14:10.243 --> 14:14.443
Why didn't you drown
in a puddle of diarrhea yet?

14:23.577 --> 14:25.277
Hello, Sam.

14:27.577 --> 14:29.377
Hello.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.544
Be stiffer.

14:30.577 --> 14:32.378
More stiff and awkward,

14:32.411 --> 14:33.877
yet charming.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.711
More stiff and awkward
than that?

14:35.745 --> 14:36.811
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.911
Hello, Sam.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.611
Yeah, hi.

14:43.646 --> 14:44.911
What happened?

14:44.945 --> 14:47.546
-Why did you summon me?
-Um...

14:47.579 --> 14:48.946
because I've been having dreams,

14:48.979 --> 14:52.447
and they're fairly
disturbing to me.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.912
What happens in the dreams?

14:55.313 --> 14:57.113
I don't want to talk about it.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.880
Well, maybe you
better talk about it.

14:58.913 --> 15:00.413
I mean, you called me.

15:00.447 --> 15:03.381
I've been having dreams
that we're fucking.

15:03.414 --> 15:05.248
Sex dreams things.

15:06.248 --> 15:07.881
Oh, gosh.

15:09.814 --> 15:11.748
This makes me very, very,

15:11.781 --> 15:14.081
very, very uncomfortable.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.282
I'm not attracted to you.

15:18.315 --> 15:20.115
I'm not attracted to you either.

15:21.615 --> 15:24.915
But do you remember
the thing that...

15:24.949 --> 15:27.783
we used to do, we did?

15:27.816 --> 15:29.783
Jesus.

15:29.816 --> 15:32.217
Yeah, of course.
I remember, yeah.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.716
-Do you?
-I remember.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.217
I don't think that
it's a good idea

15:37.251 --> 15:39.384
-that we do this.
-Same.

15:39.417 --> 15:42.217
But just for the record...

15:42.251 --> 15:44.252
I'll do it if you want to.

15:49.418 --> 15:52.085
I don't have
that outfit anymore.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.418
You have the boots?

15:54.785 --> 15:56.552
Yes, I have the boots.

15:56.585 --> 15:58.985
-Do you have the underwear?
-Shut up.

16:00.619 --> 16:02.753
Yes.

16:04.986 --> 16:06.953
I'm fully erect right now.

16:06.986 --> 16:09.254
Ugh.
I'm sick to my stomach.

16:09.287 --> 16:11.554
Well, you were always that way
before we did that.

16:11.587 --> 16:15.221
This is bad.
I know that this is bad.

16:15.255 --> 16:17.054
You know, and also,
I'm offended a little bit.

16:17.087 --> 16:18.455
I resent you

16:18.488 --> 16:20.621
for pulling us into this moment,
because we both know

16:20.655 --> 16:22.255
that you're the one
that's in control.

16:22.288 --> 16:24.055
-It's not fair, Sam.
-I don't care,

16:24.088 --> 16:25.755
you can hang up any time.

16:25.788 --> 16:27.421
I'm going back to my hotel.

16:27.455 --> 16:29.888
If you want, you can go home,
get the boots,

16:29.921 --> 16:31.389
get that underwear.

16:31.422 --> 16:33.556
My flight leaves tomorrow
at 7:00 a.m.

16:33.589 --> 16:36.056
And I don't know how I'll feel
or even what I'll do

16:36.089 --> 16:37.922
if you come over, but...

16:52.591 --> 16:54.558
Elevators ain't running.

16:54.591 --> 16:56.058
Come on.

16:56.091 --> 16:57.724
Shouldn't be getting
out of bed, Miss.

16:57.758 --> 16:59.392
Has he been here?
Have you seen him?

16:59.424 --> 17:01.058
I ain't seen him for a week.

17:01.091 --> 17:02.225
Where's Cornell?

17:02.259 --> 17:03.559
He's watching the other door.

17:03.592 --> 17:06.759
Oh, you're swell. Oh...

17:11.492 --> 17:13.560
Now, that's crazy...
it's 14 floors.

17:13.593 --> 17:16.593
I... I just got hit by a car.

17:17.925 --> 17:20.826
Oh.
Is that what that noise was?

17:22.294 --> 17:23.893
I think I'm in trouble.

17:23.925 --> 17:27.827
Mm-hmm. Maybe.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.262
And I can't tell Mom, but...

17:37.795 --> 17:39.595
...I think I'm really hurt.

17:40.595 --> 17:42.163
What?

17:44.962 --> 17:46.928
Did you-did you hit your head?

17:46.962 --> 17:48.796
No.

17:48.829 --> 17:51.596
Well, does it hurt?
Are you-are you bleeding?

17:52.596 --> 17:54.096
Well, where?

17:55.963 --> 17:57.630
I don't see any blood.

17:57.664 --> 18:00.130
Duke.

18:00.164 --> 18:02.730
Maybe it's...

18:02.764 --> 18:04.630
someplace else.

18:06.131 --> 18:08.465
Someplace else?
What... w-what do you mean?

18:17.332 --> 18:19.566
Oh.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.899
Um...

18:21.932 --> 18:23.399
Okay.

18:23.432 --> 18:25.066
No, no, no, no, no, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

18:25.099 --> 18:27.233
It's okay, you're okay.
Um,

18:27.267 --> 18:29.233
why don't we just...
we'll go upstairs, okay?

18:29.267 --> 18:31.500
I have something
you need up there. Yeah?

18:32.833 --> 18:34.067
No sense in going up there...

18:34.100 --> 18:35.567
I've been here for hours.
He ain't here.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.168
Let me go, would you?

18:47.934 --> 18:50.602
I want to call Max.

19:18.937 --> 19:21.238
-Keep it close.
-Mm-hmm.

19:36.839 --> 19:39.274
Hello, Mom.

19:40.307 --> 19:41.606
Well, don't linger there
like a huckster.

19:41.639 --> 19:42.739
Come in.

19:52.807 --> 19:55.408
Is everything okay?

20:01.608 --> 20:04.576
You called me
to come over here, Phil?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.743
My car keys.

20:20.777 --> 20:23.577
I've decided it's time.

20:23.610 --> 20:26.110
And I don't want
to talk about it. Ever.

20:26.144 --> 20:27.644
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

20:28.944 --> 20:31.111
I do have conditions, however.

20:32.312 --> 20:35.279
I want unlimited Ubers for life

20:35.312 --> 20:37.779
and a black
American Express card.

20:39.011 --> 20:41.112
Is there anything else, or...

20:41.146 --> 20:42.812
What?

20:42.845 --> 20:44.413
No, what do you mean?

20:44.446 --> 20:46.146
I...

20:46.180 --> 20:47.613
Nothing.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.413
You agree to the terms, then?

20:49.446 --> 20:52.613
Phil, yeah, we can't get
a black American Express card.

20:52.646 --> 20:55.247
Well, Ubers, then.

20:55.281 --> 20:58.080
And I want the service...
the one that brings you

20:58.113 --> 21:00.981
a different flavored popcorn
every month.

21:04.348 --> 21:05.981
I'll look into that.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.747
Good.

21:07.781 --> 21:09.748
Okay. All right.

21:09.782 --> 21:12.315
Well, I'm making dinner now.

21:12.348 --> 21:13.615
-That's very nice.
-So you should leave.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.283
Huh.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.808
Guys?

25:46.840 --> 25:49.608
Somebody?

25:49.641 --> 25:51.974
I need a tampon.

25:56.209 --> 25:59.442
I gave your last one to Duke.

25:59.475 --> 26:02.442
What?!
