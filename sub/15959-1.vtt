Memory is a funny thing.

to weave and backtrack...

sacrifices. And boy, we did.

"Skip died"...

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:44.312
...Daddy said.

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:48.775
He and my mama wrapped him
in my baseball jacket.

01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:53.822
They buried him out
under our elm tree, they said.

01:30:55.533 --> 01:30:57.701
That wasn't totally true...

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:02.873
...for he really lay buried...

01:31:03.374 --> 01:31:04.875
...in my heart.
