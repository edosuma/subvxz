Here's a little test for you.

00:02.770 --> 00:06.440
What medical drama about doctors
working in a children's hospital

00:06.507 --> 00:08.642
has been on television
the longest?

00:08.709 --> 00:12.080
Well, if you'd said anything
other than "Childrens Hospital"

00:12.146 --> 00:15.349
or "Kid Emergency Room",
you'd be wrong.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.051
But that's all
about to change.

00:17.118 --> 00:20.521
Because after fifteen
long years on the air..

00:20.588 --> 00:23.924
..."Childrens Hospital"...
is pulling the plug.

00:23.991 --> 00:27.528
I almost forget what I look like
without the makeup on, you know?

00:27.595 --> 00:30.998
(male #1)
'And later on in the program,
dolphins have long been deride''

00:31.065 --> 00:33.000
'as poor man's tuna.'

00:33.067 --> 00:35.336
'Not quite fish,
not quite mammal.'

00:35.403 --> 00:36.937
I'm Louis La Fonda.

00:37.004 --> 00:41.475
All that and Andy Rooney
tonight...on "Newsreaders".

00:41.542 --> 00:43.477
[dramatic music]

00:51.419 --> 00:53.721
For the cast and crew
of "Children's Hospital"

00:53.787 --> 00:56.624
and its many fans,
next Friday at 10:30 pm

00:56.690 --> 00:58.892
marks the end of an era.

00:58.959 --> 01:02.530
That's when the final episode
airs for the first time.

01:02.596 --> 01:06.300
In one sense,
a victim of its own success.

01:06.367 --> 01:11.572
But in another more real sense,
a victim...of low ratings.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.475
Got the "Newsreaders" crew here.
Hi, Mom.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.210
(Louis)
'"Newsreaders" set out'

01:16.277 --> 01:19.280
'to document
this historic final episode.'

01:19.347 --> 01:21.882
'But what we actually found
may surprise you.'

01:21.949 --> 01:23.117
'Action.'

01:23.184 --> 01:25.153
If he dies, let it be
on your conscience.

01:25.219 --> 01:28.622
You mean, I'm not gonna get
in any real trouble if he dies.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.491
If you can live with yourself,
afterward.

01:30.558 --> 01:34.027
Yeah, sure, totally.
Up top.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.796
I'm sorry, David?
Can we cut?

01:35.863 --> 01:38.499
I-I can't remember which hand
Blake uses to do things.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.335
Well, which hand
do you use?

01:41.402 --> 01:43.737
Blake would use
the hand you use.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.606
'Are you right-handed
or are you left-handed?'

01:45.673 --> 01:47.875
I'm sorry.
I'm just really confused.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.578
(Louis)
'But before there was the
"Childrens Hospital" of today'

01:50.644 --> 01:54.715
'there was this pilot that was
made originally for daytime TV''

01:54.782 --> 01:57.551
'It never made it to air,
but it contained the DNA'

01:57.618 --> 01:59.653
'of what the show
would eventually become.'

01:59.720 --> 02:02.055
You're both damn good doctors...
and lovers.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.192
But I have to fire one of you.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.126
- No, Chief.
- Chief, no.

02:06.194 --> 02:09.096
I actually play the role of,
uh, both twins.

02:09.163 --> 02:12.600
Stop and we'll just switch the,
uh...switch it over.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.269
- Okay, good.
- Quickly, please.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.037
'This is the 1960s', guys.'

02:17.104 --> 02:20.708
In fact, as soon as anybody
opens their mouth on a TV show

02:20.774 --> 02:22.943
you've to pay them
a lot more money.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.378
Isn't that right, Jay?

02:24.445 --> 02:27.415
But some people were
lucky enough to get lines.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.250
Fifteen seasons worth.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.419
'The cast
of "Childrens Hospital".'

02:31.485 --> 02:34.988
None of us knew it would get
so big so fast, did we?

02:35.055 --> 02:38.692
It was like a runaway train with
its head cut off, wasn't it?

02:38.759 --> 02:42.162
I couldn't walk down the street
...without being mobbed.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.898
I had to walk down
through neighborhoods

02:44.965 --> 02:46.800
where mostly
blind people lived

02:46.867 --> 02:49.069
so I could have some peace
while walking.

[foreign language]

02:50.204 --> 02:51.805
[foreign language translated]

02:51.872 --> 02:54.442
It's hard for me
because I don't speak English.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.378
Fans think that because I learn
all of my lines phonetically

02:57.445 --> 03:00.281
I understand them
when they make sex talk at me.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.383
I only kind of do.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.621
You're gorgeous,
you know that.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.326
'You're gorgeous.'

03:12.393 --> 03:13.861
Very beautiful.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.598
By the end of the first season

03:17.665 --> 03:20.067
"Childrens Hospital"
was a bonafide hit.

03:20.133 --> 03:23.237
But even as these gorgeous
doctors were breaking hearts

03:23.304 --> 03:25.506
the show itself was
breaking new ground.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.841
'Such as this scene
from season four.'

03:27.908 --> 03:31.879
'The first time a doctor
was portrayed on television'

03:31.945 --> 03:33.146
'by a woman.'

03:33.213 --> 03:34.648
Oh! Sorry, nurse.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.017
We thought the new doctor
was coming in.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.319
She did just come in.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.188
First of all, you
mean, "he" just came in.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.423
And where is he?

03:42.490 --> 03:45.659
No. I definitely
did not mean "he".

03:47.728 --> 03:50.364
What are you
talking about, nurse?

03:50.431 --> 03:51.799
Uh, what is
your name again?

03:51.865 --> 03:56.236
The name is Lola Spratt,
Dr. Lola Spratt.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.309
Righteous!

04:01.375 --> 04:03.777
(Louis)
'And "Childrens Hospital"
would popularize'

04:03.844 --> 04:06.714
'more than just
the catch phrase "Righteous!"'

a global phenomenon.'

The tornado has passed.

We may be trapped here for
a while, but help is on the way.

disillusioned and bored,
culminating in the now-infamous

the beginning of the end

of "Childrens Hospital,"

middle of our news story.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.623
Tell me about the scandal.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.458
Well, you can listen
to the tabloids

05:24.525 --> 05:26.494
but here's my side of the story.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.499

I was trading derivatives in
Asian markets and rededicating

feel when you knew

the same reaction.

episode makes me physically ill.

I mean, I'd rather
do anything else.

I'd rather do a fifteen-minute
low budget comedy

06:37.164 --> 06:40.468

I mean, not literally.

wanted to clarify--

09:13.453 --> 09:15.923
We did it. Well, what needs
to be clarified?

09:15.989 --> 09:18.558
We wrote letters,
and she saved the hospital.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.728
I helped save
a children's hospital.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.096
Well, you helped to save

- Right. A children's hospital.

- Right.
- I'm sorry--
