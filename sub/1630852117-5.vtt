WEBVTT

00:27.736 --> 00:29.112
They found Ari's body.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.197
Ari's body.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.074
I'm next.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.161
<i>I forgot what the fuck I did.</i>

00:38.079 --> 00:40.290
<i>I was at home, I said,</i>
<i>"I know I did something."</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:44.044
<i>"'Cause there's too many</i>
<i>white folks paying attention to me."</i>

00:45.086 --> 00:45.962
Yo, what up, C?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.172
Yo.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.799
I know we agreed
that you should go see Gene alone,

00:49.883 --> 00:51.634
but I'm thinking we should revisit that.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.220
No, look, C.

00:54.304 --> 00:58.058
Gene's gotta be treated like he matters.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.227
<i>I know how fans like Gene operate.</i>
<i>I can handle him.</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:06.357
Look, if you don't get him
to take care of that video,

01:06.441 --> 01:07.942
it's gonna be a problem.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.903
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.613
That's why I'm on it.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.948
I got it, I promise.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.254
I hope you ain't lying.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.225
Hey.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.060
Good morning, my friend. How are you?

02:24.727 --> 02:25.687
Uh…

02:27.147 --> 02:28.565
Fantastic, man.

02:32.235 --> 02:36.489
Everything is fine, said the comedian who
shit the bed in front of 20,000 people.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.033
Come on, man.
You froze up on stage. Big deal.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.244
Little bump in the road. Keep going.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.372
<i>The mark of a true champion</i>
<i>is how you respond to adversity,</i>

02:44.455 --> 02:49.169
and you are the truest of champions.
You always bounce back, so… bounce back.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.754
That's great advice, Todd.
I appreciate you.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.424
You don't have to thank me.
Never have to thank me.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.635
I also wanted to mention to you, um…

02:57.719 --> 03:00.388
Billie did the Ha Ha Hut last night,

03:00.471 --> 03:02.182
<i>and you should check it out.</i>
<i>It's on YouTube.</i>

03:02.265 --> 03:05.143
-How was she? Was she good?
<i>-She was better than good.</i>

03:05.810 --> 03:06.895
In fact,

03:08.271 --> 03:11.816
I was thinking maybe
we should have her do that charity event.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.443
What charity event?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.615
Remember that asshole
on the plane doing your bits for you,

03:18.698 --> 03:21.326
showed up at the show with his boss,
offered you that charity thing?

03:21.409 --> 03:22.243
That's tonight.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.578
<i>I also wanted to remind you</i>

03:23.661 --> 03:25.663
<i>you gotta stop by Wells Fargo</i>
<i>for last looks</i>

03:25.747 --> 03:27.290
<i>before they take the stage down.</i>

03:27.373 --> 03:30.543
Go back to Billie for a second,
was she good or great?

03:33.296 --> 03:35.840
I'll say it was the old Billie. Okay?

03:36.382 --> 03:38.009
Really, you should check it out.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.822
<i> I don't know how old you are,</i>
<i>you look very hydrated. Congratulations.</i>

03:59.906 --> 04:03.034
<i>But I was a kid in the '90s,</i>
<i>and I remember the Atkins Diet.</i>

04:03.117 --> 04:04.911
<i>Who remembers the Atkins Diet?</i>

04:04.994 --> 04:07.121
-<i> I'm on it right now.</i>
<i>-You're on it now?</i>

04:07.205 --> 04:09.999
-<i> Yeah, I'm on that.</i>
-<i>It's not good for you, sir.</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:12.752
<i>Didn't you read the news in 1994?</i>

04:12.835 --> 04:14.295
<i>So, you remember it right?</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:18.007
<i>Your mom's weird work friends coming over,</i>
<i>just shriveling up week by week</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:20.051
<i>'cause all they would eat</i>
<i>was plain hamburger meat</i>

04:20.134 --> 04:21.469
<i>and a fistful of string cheeses?</i>

04:21.552 --> 04:24.764
<i>Your math teacher smelled like</i>
<i>a chili dog every day? It was terrifying.</i>

04:24.847 --> 04:27.767
<i>But now, we have Atkins 2.0.</i>
<i>It's better than ever.</i>

04:27.850 --> 04:29.269
<i>-The keto diet.</i>

04:56.504 --> 04:57.630
Hey.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.841
We need you to come with us.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.718
We have some news about Ari.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.736
The police found Ari last night.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.823
-In a dumpster on the north side.
-Oh, my God.

05:24.949 --> 05:29.329
Whoever did it, didn't know the first
fucking thing about hiding a body.

05:29.412 --> 05:33.958
-They were trying to send us a message--
-Or he was done by a fucking amateur.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.345
You know a guy named Ray?

05:47.430 --> 05:51.184
He and Ari had business together
the same night he went missing.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.604
Ray? The cat that owns the car wash?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.856
He be buying watches
and trinkets and shit?

05:56.939 --> 05:58.816
I thought he didn't trust that dude.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.444
You know him?

06:01.944 --> 06:02.904
Yeah, I--

06:03.571 --> 06:04.697
Nah. Not…

06:06.282 --> 06:08.409
Look, Ray ain't about that life.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.830
An amateur.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.588
Sometimes what people can do
will surprise you, Carlton.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.300
Yeah. Yeah.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.102
Yo.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.689
-Tell me why you're mad, man.
-<i> I wanna come live with you.</i>

06:38.773 --> 06:40.942
Why you so mad at her?
What did she do to you?

06:41.025 --> 06:43.611
<i>Nothing. I just don't wanna be here.</i>

06:45.863 --> 06:48.574
All right, do this for me.
Why don't you wait till I get to New York?

06:48.658 --> 06:52.412
After I get to New York, me, you,
your mom, we'll talk, find a solution.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.830
We'll figure it out. I promise.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.166
<i>If I was there,</i>
<i>you wouldn't have froze on stage.</i>

06:58.918 --> 07:02.171
I love you. Behave. We'll talk soon. Okay?

07:03.548 --> 07:04.382
Okay?

07:05.007 --> 07:06.551
<i>-Okay.</i>
-All right.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.141
Hey.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.436
Hey. That, uh, charity event.
Did you talk to Billie about that?

07:16.519 --> 07:18.187
-Not yet.
-All right. Well, don't.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.148
Don't say nothing
'cause I'm gonna to do it.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.357
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.609
I can use it as practice
before The Garden.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.279
-Cool. I'll call them.
-Out. I'm off to Wells Fargo.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.363
Hey.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.284
What made you offer Billie
Madison Square Garden in the first place?

07:31.367 --> 07:32.660
We never talked about it.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.539
I knew she was upset because
I haven't been using her new jokes,

07:36.622 --> 07:38.624
so it was a way for me to repay her.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.418
That's the Kid I know and love.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.337
One less thing to worry about.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.841
Well, it's difficult for you, because you,
my friend, worry about everything.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.135
I will worry less
when your ass is out of Philadelphia.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.637
Soon. Very soon.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.066
I didn't see Ari.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.943
I didn't see Ari.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.279
I didn't see him.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.363
He called me.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.160
We were supposed to do a deal
on some keyboard trackers.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.536
He told me he had to reschedule.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.500
He kept bragging about
some whale that he was scheming on.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.044
He talked about some
fancy hotel he was going to.

08:23.127 --> 08:26.506
Okay, okay, okay. Which one?
What's the name of the place?

08:26.589 --> 08:27.882
No, no, no!

08:27.965 --> 08:30.134
-Hmm?
-The Four Seasons. The Four Seasons!

08:30.218 --> 08:31.344
-He's lying.
-What?

08:31.427 --> 08:34.138
He's lying. Ari would never tell him
the moves he's making.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.765
You little shit!

08:35.848 --> 08:37.892
This is why
we didn't trust that motherfucker!

08:38.017 --> 08:39.894
You shit! I tried
to figure out who it was,

08:39.977 --> 08:40.978
but he wouldn't say.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.107
That's all I know.
I don't know nothin' else, I swear.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.317
What are you doing?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.779
-What are you doing?
-That's all you know, that's all you know.

08:49.862 --> 08:50.738
Don't worry about it.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.115
Oh, God…

08:59.914 --> 09:01.123
-Savvas.
-What?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.708
-What did you just do?
-What'd I do?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.086
You didn't let him answer, stupid.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.921
You've been busting my balls today.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.464
You should've let him speak.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.508
-On my case all day.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.884
Cut the bullshit and finish up.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.554
-Mom's calling. Shit.
-Fuck. I don't wanna talk to her.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.973
-I don't want to talk to her.
-Mom, Mommy.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.225
God bless, my Mommy.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.394
Whatever you say.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.480
Sure, Mommy.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.232
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

09:26.315 --> 09:28.317
We're gonna be there in like ten minutes.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.070
-I love-- <i>Sagapo. </i>Love you. Yes.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.113
Mama wants to see us.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.156
She gets
on my nerves when she cries.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.535
-When Mom calls us…
-Take the phone and go fuck yourself.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.370
Oh, God. Motherfucker.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.498
No, man.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.212
There's no messages from Ari here.
Looks like he was telling the truth.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.549
Doesn't sound like Ari,
but we'll check out the Four Seasons.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.344
First we gotta go
to Mama's house. Come on, Carlton.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.115
Yo. Why are you with them?

10:18.034 --> 10:22.204
Because they came and snatched my ass up.
We on the hunt to find out who killed Ari.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.289
Shit.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.458
-Are you okay?
<i>-Yeah, so far.</i>

10:25.541 --> 10:27.460
I saw them dead this dude Ray, man.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.795
<i>They thought he had</i>
<i>information on where Ari was</i> at.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.172
Whoa. Hold on, they killed him?

10:31.255 --> 10:32.465
Did they?

10:32.548 --> 10:35.009
Shoved shears
right down his fucking throat.

10:35.092 --> 10:38.596
Yeah, the dumbass.
He came to meet Ari the night before.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.557
<i>-Ari told him what was up.</i>
-Did he mention my name?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.267
-Did he say shit about my name?
-Nah, nah.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.062
No. They deaded him before
he could even say anything.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.357
Look, man, I told you,
these motherfuckers here, they're crazy.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.401
You gotta be careful, man. Okay?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.945
-You gotta be fucking careful.
<i>-Yeah, no question.</i>

10:55.613 --> 10:58.199
So, uh, you talk to your man, Gene?

10:58.282 --> 11:00.451
I'll have that whole thing
wrapped up tonight.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.453
That's good.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.288
We don't want to see this. You understand?

11:04.372 --> 11:07.375
I hear you.
You don't have to finish, I'm on it.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.126
<i>You hear me? Be careful.</i>

11:09.210 --> 11:11.629
Yo, here they come. All right.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.546
One.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.219
Fuck.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.567
So, how…
How's your mother holding up?

11:34.652 --> 11:37.738
She wants to make sure
we do everything we can to get justice.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.909
She said it's <i>ανοιχτή σεζόν</i>
on the asshole who killed our brother.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.703
What does that mean?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.621
Open season.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.417
Damn.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.420
I'm gonna drop you off.
We gotta go identify Ari's body.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.131
That's cool.
I'm down to do whatever's necessary.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.426
After we see Ari,

11:59.510 --> 12:02.388
I want to make a stop. Just you and me.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.849
-Do you have secrets, man?
-Yes, secrets.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.184
I could roll with you if you want.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.227
No.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.532
<i> You know why?</i>
<i>You know why I thought the worst?</i>

12:21.615 --> 12:24.076
<i>I thought the worst</i>
<i>because I know what I was doing as a child</i>

12:24.160 --> 12:26.245
<i>when I was in my room</i>
<i>and my door was closed.</i>

12:26.328 --> 12:29.457
<i>In the room with the door closed,</i>
<i>I was always doing the worst shit possible</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:31.083
<i>on the other side of that door.</i>

12:31.167 --> 12:33.794
<i>Every time my mom bust in my room,</i>

12:33.878 --> 12:36.547
<i>true story, people,</i>
<i>my dick was always in my hand.</i>

12:36.630 --> 12:39.133
<i>Swear to God. Every time.</i>
<i>"What you doing, boy?"</i>

12:39.216 --> 12:40.634
<i>-One time, she came in,</i>

12:40.718 --> 12:43.679
<i>I had my dick in this hand,</i>
<i>and I had matches in this hand.</i>

12:43.763 --> 12:46.223
<i>I don't know what was about to happen,</i>
<i>she got there on time.</i>

12:46.307 --> 12:49.185
<i>I told her, "There was about to be</i>
<i>a hot dick in this bathroom,</i>

12:49.268 --> 12:50.853
<i>I was gonna set this dick on fire."</i>

12:50.936 --> 12:53.481
-Hello.
-<i> Hey. What's up, champ?</i>

12:53.564 --> 12:55.399
<i>You ready to have an amazing time?</i>

12:55.483 --> 12:57.276
<i>I'm talking Green Day-style.</i>

12:58.319 --> 13:00.112
<i>-Come on, I'm outside.</i>
Okay.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.366


13:04.450 --> 13:05.785
<i>Yeah!</i>

13:07.912 --> 13:09.163
Whoa!

13:09.246 --> 13:10.706
-Wow!

13:10.790 --> 13:13.626
This is… It's like a spaceship.
This is amazing!

13:13.709 --> 13:14.668
You like it?

13:15.753 --> 13:18.255
-It's like <i>MTV Cribs</i>, except it's a van.
-What?

13:18.339 --> 13:21.258
-Are you live? Let me talk to them.
-Oh, yeah.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.636
-Please.
-The man. Here's the man.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.848
What up, world?
We on Gene live, baby. We 'bout to go up.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.936
First, major shout out to you guys,
biggest shout out to my guy, Gene.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.813
It's all me and this guy.

13:33.896 --> 13:37.024
I'm talking great food,
great conversation.

13:37.107 --> 13:42.029
Listen to me when I tell y'all this.
I'm about to show this man a blast!

13:42.112 --> 13:45.115
<i>I'm gonna give him a night</i>
<i>he's never gonna forget. Mark my words.</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:47.159
-Here.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.912
Oh, man. Kid-Gene, behind the scenes!

14:08.305 --> 14:10.975
All right, Gene. You gotta go live, man.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.686
You gotta make
all those new followers feel jealous.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.020
Yes, yes, yes.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.898
Look, this is my brother
without the melanin, right here.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.942
My guy. I told y'all.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.319
Look at you, Gene.
You got 600,000 followers in one day!

14:22.403 --> 14:23.779
-I know.
-Good job, man.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.739
-This way, please.
-Yes, right here?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.157
-Okay.

14:28.033 --> 14:28.909
Right here?

14:28.993 --> 14:31.203
How's it feel
to support such a good cause?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.456
So, Gene, how'd this happen?
You and Kid hooking up?

14:35.749 --> 14:39.295
He wanted to make amends
for yelling at me at the hospital,

14:39.378 --> 14:40.838
like the good guy he is.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.176
Gene, come around.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.305
Come here. Get in the shot. Come on!

14:51.599 --> 14:53.976
I wanna add somebody.
One sec, guys. One quick sec.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.561
Here he is. Come on.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.605
Come on, man.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.399
You doing this
for the kids in Philly?

15:00.482 --> 15:01.400
Yes.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.695
Thank you, guys. Thank you. Come on, man.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.947
Bro, stop stealing my shine. Come on.

15:07.823 --> 15:11.827
Thank you for coming and making this night
one that I will talk about forever.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.204
-I'm gonna introduce you.
-Thank you, man.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.082
Gene, I need you to wish me luck.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.126
You see what's been going on,
I need a win.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.128
You've never had two bad nights in a row.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.379
Trust me, I know.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.964
But, hey, good luck.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.633
-You're my guy.
-Hey, buddy.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.135
Could use some of
that good press after last night, huh?

15:29.303 --> 15:30.930
I just wanna focus on the, uh…

15:31.013 --> 15:32.473
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Uh, listen.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.642
Crush tonight, call it even
on the cell phone charger.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.435
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.312
-It's Will, right?
-Yeah. Hell yeah.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.688
All right. Just wanna make sure.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.524
But first, we're gonna laugh.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.610
Please welcome to the stage

15:44.693 --> 15:47.029
one of Hollywood's brightest stars,

15:47.112 --> 15:49.323
Philadelphia's own… The Kid!

15:49.406 --> 15:50.240
Let's hear it!

15:50.324 --> 15:52.284
-Yeah!

15:52.368 --> 15:54.411
Thank you. Thank you. Oh.

15:55.996 --> 16:00.209
Oh, my! What an applause.
Thank you, guys. I like that.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.379
Feel like y'all could do better.
Make a bit more noise than that!

16:05.381 --> 16:08.175
Show some love. So good. So good.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.719
Don't cheat me. Don't cheat me.

16:12.179 --> 16:15.516
All right, let's address the elephant
in the room before we do anything.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.851
How many saw me bomb
the other night? Be honest.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.896
Yeah? Yeah, everybody saw it?

16:21.438 --> 16:24.066
Well, here's the good news,
that's not going to happen tonight.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.776
So get it out your goddamn heads.

16:25.859 --> 16:26.777
As a matter of fact,

16:26.860 --> 16:28.821
what I want you to do
is to take out your phones.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.073
Take out your phones.
You got something good to record.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.784
I'm about to fuck this show up.
We're gonna have a good time.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.869
There's a lot of good things to laugh at.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.080
A lot of good moments,
a lot of funny shit.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.999
But before I do,

16:40.082 --> 16:42.710
I gotta talk about
my guy, Will, for a second, man.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.462
You guys know Will? Y'all know Will?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.756
-Yeah? Y'all know Will?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.717
I had the pleasure of meeting Will

16:49.800 --> 16:52.553
on a flight from LA here, to Philadelphia.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.013
-We shared first class.
-Yeah.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.723
And I found out Will was a fan.

16:55.806 --> 16:59.977
So much a fan that he decided
to steal my joke on the plane

17:00.060 --> 17:01.812
and do my bit on me.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.772
And in that bit, he showed me…

17:03.856 --> 17:06.233
He showed me
how much he loves to say the word "nigga."

17:12.281 --> 17:13.407
He does!

17:13.490 --> 17:16.285
Will says the word "nigga" a lot.
He doesn't care where he is.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.621
We were on the plane in first-class.
He was like, "Nigga!"

17:19.705 --> 17:21.457
"Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!"

17:21.540 --> 17:22.708
"Nigga!"

17:22.791 --> 17:24.001
Y'all never heard this?

17:24.084 --> 17:26.462
You got a Black boss.
You never did this bit for your boss?

17:27.129 --> 17:30.382
You gotta do the nigga bit
for your Black boss.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.052
-You've never heard Will do the nigga bit?
-No.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.345
Will, you gotta
do the bit for your Black boss.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.432
I didn't know your Black boss
has never heard you do the nigga bit.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.350
Hersch! What did he say, man?

17:40.434 --> 17:42.936
He said, uh, "It's okay
if you do the 'ah' not the 'er.'"

17:43.020 --> 17:44.396
"It's okay." That's what he said.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.522
Yeah, say "ah".

17:45.606 --> 17:48.901
Your Black boss ain't gonna get mad
if you say "ah." Call him a nigga.

17:48.984 --> 17:52.071
Do it. No, but it won't…
it won't bother him, right?

17:52.154 --> 17:53.697
So, do it. "Nigga!" Come on.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.199
Okay. Okay.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.452
Get in his face how you did mine.
Remember?

17:58.535 --> 18:00.162
"Nigga!"

18:00.746 --> 18:02.456
"Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga."

18:03.082 --> 18:05.209
You wanna do it. Here.
Take the mic. You can do it.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.251
Come on, man.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.003
What?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.131
You made your point.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.425
If you're not gonna do it,
then I'm wasting my time.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.970
I wanted you to make everybody laugh,
'cause you do the joke well, man.

18:17.513 --> 18:21.391
Hersch, he didn't wanna do the bit.
He didn't wanna do the bit, Hersch.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.935
He had me and you dying.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.895
-Yeah, sure did.
-Oh, my God!

18:24.978 --> 18:26.772
Well, guys,
if Will isn't gonna do the bit,

18:26.855 --> 18:28.774
then I guess I need to do bits.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.443
I'll make you laugh since
Will don't wanna make you laugh.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.905
It's a charity event, goddamn it,
so I feel like we should give.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.907
Who wanna give their kids away?
Am I the only one?

18:36.990 --> 18:39.076
-Raise your hand. Am I the only one?

18:39.159 --> 18:41.703
I'll auction my fuckin' kids off
right now if I could.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.835
I think I'm back.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.547
Do you know what's crazy?
I didn't realize that I needed that.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.173
I guess I did.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.801
-Hey, Kid.
-Yeah?

18:55.884 --> 18:57.094
-Not tonight.
-Hersch.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.095
We good.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.973
Thanks a lot, man.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.766
After you left, my boss went on a rampage,

19:02.850 --> 19:05.269
and he fired me for being
an embarrassment to the company.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.520
That's, uh…

19:07.229 --> 19:08.105
That's terrible.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.983
Yeah! Something tells me
you don't really mean that.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.485
What happened on the airplane
was because I am a fan.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.778
-A fan?
-Yeah.

19:14.862 --> 19:18.407
-Oh. I thought you was being a dick.
-Fucking asshole.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.577
I… I repeated your joke back to you.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.453
-Mmm.
-Okay? You wrote that joke.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.291
And I'm sorry if I offended you,
but you cost me my fucking job!

19:27.374 --> 19:30.544
I didn't cost you a damn thing.
You cost yourself your job.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.503
Wow.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.423
That's a hell of a way to treat fans.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.635
-You have a good night.
-Hey, you have a better night.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.515
I cost him his job.
Get the fuck out of here.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.350
Karma's a bitch, ain't it?

19:46.101 --> 19:48.562
What were you saying?
You were saying, um… Uh…

19:48.645 --> 19:50.606
Talkin' about, oh,
stand-up back in the day.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.027
I'm gonna, um…
I think I'm gonna head back to the motel.

19:55.736 --> 19:56.653
I gotta go.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.489
Why? Wait, wait, wait. We didn't even eat.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.868
Shit. Come on, Hersch.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.753
So, what I'll do, Gene, in New York,

20:13.503 --> 20:17.799
I can basically, I can leave you
tickets to all three nights, man.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.385
Cool?

20:21.845 --> 20:24.431
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.266
Do you like your fans?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.101
What you talking about?

20:28.185 --> 20:32.231
Because you treated
that guy Will like garbage.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.692
-And he's a fan.
-No, Will's an asshole. He's not a fan.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.778
You? You're a fan, Gene.

20:37.861 --> 20:38.737
Mm.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.199
Are you saying that
because you think it's true?

20:42.991 --> 20:46.411
Or because I have a video
that you need me to erase?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.879
-Enjoy your stay.
-Thank you.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.056
-You're the manager?
-I am.

21:07.808 --> 21:08.809
Seen this man?

21:09.434 --> 21:12.396
Okay, Gene, look.
Am I concerned about the video? Yes.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.397
Mm-hmm.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.023
Yes, I am concerned.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.402
But I'm not being nice to you
because you have the video.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.611
-Really?
-Yes.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.363
Then why you being nice to me?

21:21.446 --> 21:24.408
I'm being nice to you
because you're a good dude, Gene.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.535
You're cool as shit.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.622
Will was different.
Will's got some shit with him.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.750
You gotta understand,
every fan doesn't mean well.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.294
That's because we're human.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.713
And humans make mistakes.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.464
We're not like you.

21:40.007 --> 21:40.924
You're--

21:41.008 --> 21:42.801
Kid, you're a superhero.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.720
Gene. That's not true.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.723
It's not true, man. I'm a regular guy.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.808
-I make mistakes.
-Mm-hmm.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.394
-Maybe this was a mistake.
-No, no, no.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.479
You're saying this
because I have the video.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.981
You weren't ready for me to--

21:56.064 --> 21:59.192
You're saying that because I have
this video, you're trying to play me.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.819
No, Gene. Gene. Look at me.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.654
-You gotta calm down.
-No. No.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.781
Maybe you think
all your fans are like Will.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.200
That we're all just…
We're all just trying to attack you.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.286
Huh?

22:09.369 --> 22:12.080
I'm sorry, but hotel policy
prevents me from disclosing

22:12.164 --> 22:14.458
any information about guests or residents.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.836
No. The man in this picture
is my brother. Okay?

22:17.919 --> 22:19.254
He was murdered.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.924
And someone told us
that he was here a few nights ago.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.345
The night he was murdered. So…

22:27.679 --> 22:30.724
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Have you seen him?

22:34.603 --> 22:38.690
No. I've covered this entire week,
and I haven't seen him.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.692
You notice?

22:41.401 --> 22:42.986
-I did.
-There are two.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.364
-Yes, over here too.
-Three.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.783
-Yeah.
-Leave that picture with me.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.203
And a number.
I will ask the other workers.

22:51.995 --> 22:55.082
And call you
if anything is said to the contrary.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.167
Thanks very much. I'd appreciate it.

23:00.003 --> 23:00.921
Hey.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.924
Famous people stay here, yeah?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.885
Naturally, we are the Four Seasons.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.347
-Well, naturally.
-My condolences about your brother.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.057
Thank you.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.859
<i> I made a mistake at the hospital.</i>

23:24.069 --> 23:25.445
Weren't you mad at me, Kid?

23:26.571 --> 23:27.697
Huh?

23:30.367 --> 23:32.661
I'm not even supposed
to have this stupid video.

23:35.038 --> 23:38.750
The only reason I have it
is because I followed you that night,

23:38.834 --> 23:41.378
so I can apologize for upsetting you!

23:44.047 --> 23:45.382
I didn't wanna upset <i>you.</i>

23:47.884 --> 23:48.969
Look what you did.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.559
If I showed this video to anyone,
if I sent it to anyone…

23:58.311 --> 23:59.855
your life will be ruined.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.149
You'd go to jail.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.361
Everyone who loves you
would be so ashamed.

24:12.742 --> 24:15.996
If you sent that video out,
what kind of fan would you be?

24:17.622 --> 24:20.542
If you know something
that can hurt somebody

24:20.625 --> 24:22.752
and you still go and do it anyway,

24:22.836 --> 24:23.879
are you being a fan?

24:24.963 --> 24:26.131
Are you being a friend,

24:26.214 --> 24:29.176
or are you
taking advantage of a situation?

24:29.259 --> 24:31.386
Will took advantage of a situation.

24:32.220 --> 24:36.975
You only have that video because
my brother took advantage of a situation.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.854
Do you understand that, Gene?
They took advantage.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.565
If you wanna go ahead do it, then do it.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.694
But do not say I was mistreating a fan.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.613
You tell the truth, okay?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.865
Make sure you tell the truth.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.284
That I was being a regular guy.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.121
Whether you wanna accept
that or not, Gene, I'm human.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.414
I'm not a superhero.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.917
I'm a regular guy.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.793
I made a mistake.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.256
I made a mistake, Gene.

25:09.591 --> 25:13.595
That's the worst night of my life,
when I made that mistake. I know that!

25:14.429 --> 25:16.681
You telling me
I don't deserve a second chance?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.184
Is that what you're saying to me, Gene?

25:30.153 --> 25:31.738
Well, I would never hurt you.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.245
'Cause the world needs you.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.459
I need you.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.848
I guess I just
saw myself in that guy Will.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.684
I understand.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.936
But our relationship is different.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.021
-Okay?
-Yeah.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.067
Can I still go to New York?

26:09.150 --> 26:12.696
Yes, you can come
to the whole East Coast leg of the tour.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.072
You can be a part of it.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.160
As "Behind the Scenes Gene"?

26:20.829 --> 26:22.205
As "Behind the Scenes Gene."

26:25.292 --> 26:26.334
Here.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.924
-Um…
-Come here. Come here.

26:33.967 --> 26:34.926
It's all right.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.845
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.556
You did good, man. All right?

26:40.890 --> 26:42.267
-You are a superhero.
-No.

26:43.184 --> 26:44.227
Hey.

26:44.811 --> 26:45.645
Thank you.

26:47.647 --> 26:48.565
My guy.

26:49.858 --> 26:50.859
Your guy.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.454
You all right?

27:05.582 --> 27:06.583
Yeah.

27:08.668 --> 27:12.464
I mean, he kinda lost it for a minute.
But we got it worked out.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.342
My man's kinda crazy, ain't he?

27:15.425 --> 27:16.509
A little bit.

27:17.719 --> 27:18.887
Actually, a lot of bit.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.098
I deal with fans day in, day out.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.727
I forget something about what I do
makes them feel good about themselves.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.646
Gene did that for you tonight?

27:27.729 --> 27:28.688
He did.

27:33.693 --> 27:34.819
He definitely did.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.294
<i> Yeah?</i>

27:51.378 --> 27:52.671
Yo, video's gone?

27:54.089 --> 27:55.465
Believe it or not, it is.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.052
<i>Did your guys</i>
<i>find what they were looking for?</i>

27:59.135 --> 28:01.638
No, but they ain't stopped looking.

28:01.721 --> 28:03.890
-I got you. Let's talk tomorrow.
<i>-One.</i>

28:04.474 --> 28:05.475
Was that C?

28:06.685 --> 28:07.644
Y'all good?

28:08.478 --> 28:09.604
I think we will be.

28:35.922 --> 28:36.756
Damn.

28:44.097 --> 28:47.600
<i> I told y'all, red carpets</i>
<i>and everything, get used to seeing him.</i>

28:49.310 --> 28:51.187
<i>Thank you, guys. Thank you.</i>

28:54.357 --> 28:55.859
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

28:55.942 --> 28:58.445
<i>Look, this is my brother</i>
<i>without the melanin, right here.</i>

28:58.528 --> 29:00.572
<i>My guy. I told y'all.</i>

29:01.489 --> 29:05.910
<i>Gene, you're startin' to look like me.</i>
<i>Except the complexion difference and all.</i>

29:05.994 --> 29:10.165
<i>What, you got 600,000 new followers now?</i>
<i>Go, Gene. Go, man!</i>

29:11.207 --> 29:13.835
<i>Yo, bro, stop stealing my shine. Come on.</i>

29:49.204 --> 29:51.289
<i> …go up for a minute,</i>
<i>when I've done that,</i>

29:51.372 --> 29:52.832
<i>it's all me and this guy.</i>

29:52.916 --> 29:55.084
<i>I'm talking restaurants, great food,</i>

29:55.168 --> 29:56.795
<i>-great conversation.</i>

29:58.296 --> 29:59.714
<i>We're gonna build, man. I'm--</i>

30:08.306 --> 30:10.642
-Hey, Carlton.
-Yo. What's up?

30:10.725 --> 30:12.936
-Everything okay? Kid?
-Can I--? Yeah.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.938
No, I just came to apologize, man,

30:15.021 --> 30:18.149
for treating you like you was
a crazed stalker the other day.

30:18.233 --> 30:22.195
-Sometimes I get protective of my brother.
-You were a little mean, but…

30:22.278 --> 30:25.698
You know, he told me that you
got rid of the video and everything.

30:25.782 --> 30:30.245
-You did get rid of the video, right?
-Yeah. Deleted completely from my phone.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.664
Right, right. See, that's smart.

30:32.747 --> 30:34.290
Smart. Smart.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.543
'Cause we gotta do
whatever we can to keep him safe.

30:36.626 --> 30:37.752
Not just him.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.046
You and him.

30:40.129 --> 30:41.589
Yeah…

30:42.590 --> 30:45.718
But I assure you,
your and Kid's secret is safe with me.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.847
Good, because I told him
that if you have his back,

30:48.930 --> 30:50.348
then he should show you love.

30:50.974 --> 30:51.808
Yeah.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.018
And that's what he did.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.563
It's a gift for you, man.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.738
Oh, my goodness.

31:06.364 --> 31:10.368
But this is a Rolex Submariner!
Do you know how expensive this is?

31:10.451 --> 31:11.911
Oh, I damn sure do.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.913
-Yeah.

31:18.042 --> 31:18.960
Holy.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.046
Oh, my goodness.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.215
Hey, Gene, man. You know, like…

31:24.299 --> 31:28.094
I get why I love my brother,
but what is all of this?

31:28.177 --> 31:29.846
Why you love him so much?

31:31.723 --> 31:32.682
Oh…

31:37.228 --> 31:38.730
Your brother saved my life.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.443
My sister, Angie…

31:45.570 --> 31:46.529
battled cancer.

31:49.032 --> 31:49.991
Lost it.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.996
Um, Kid was the only thing
that kept the smile on her face.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.207
After she died, uh…

31:59.709 --> 32:01.377
things got really dark for me.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.964
Until I put on Kid's <i>Laugh 'Til You Cry.</i>

32:07.425 --> 32:09.135
Kept me from hurting myself.

32:10.595 --> 32:11.763
Kept me sane.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.725
Whoa. Heavy.

32:15.808 --> 32:16.684
Mm.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.896
Well, now he considers you family, so…

32:24.692 --> 32:26.069
Now that we're family…

32:27.654 --> 32:29.864
can I ask you to do something for me?

32:32.533 --> 32:33.409
What's up?

32:35.828 --> 32:37.372
Don't be a burden to Kid.

32:38.957 --> 32:39.999
Lift him up.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.752
Don't drag him down.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.256
Okay.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.551
You have a good night.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.378
-<i>Carlton.</i>
-Yo.

33:26.045 --> 33:26.963
<i>What?</i>

33:28.214 --> 33:30.550
I think I found the dude you looking for.

33:32.552 --> 33:33.386
<i>Yeah?</i>

33:34.971 --> 33:35.805
Yeah.
