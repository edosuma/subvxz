You wanna see my pecker?

19:07.312 --> 19:08.105
{\an3}No, I never want to see
your pecker again!

19:08.188 --> 19:10.899
{\an1}Oh, come on,
it'll take you home.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.234
{\an3}What?

19:12.317 --> 19:14.403
{\an1}It'll take you back to your
world if you look at my pecker.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.904
{\an3}What do you mean,
"my world"?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.031
- (roars)
- Whoa, what is that?

19:18.115 --> 19:20.200
It's a uni-shark.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.286
- That's not possible!
- It is in this world.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.080
- Hey, you wanna see my pecker?
- Yes!

19:25.163 --> 19:26.874
{\an5}- You wanna see my pecker?
- Yes!

19:26.957 --> 19:29.042
- You sure?
- Please, God, yes!

19:29.126 --> 19:30.752
- Here it is.
- Where is it?

19:30.836 --> 19:32.421
{\an1}It's my beak.
[laughs]

19:32.504 --> 19:34.423
- [roars]
- Oh, God!

19:34.506 --> 19:35.257
Please, show me your dick!

19:35.340 --> 19:38.302
{\an1}That's nasty.
You're a pervert.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.054
- You started all this!
- So you wanna see my pecker?

19:41.138 --> 19:44.474
- Yes, please.
- Here it is!

19:44.558 --> 19:46.351
Oh, oh, wha...

19:46.435 --> 19:48.437
- You wanna see my pecker again?
- No!

19:48.520 --> 19:49.438
{\an5}- You wanna see my pecker?
- No!

19:49.521 --> 19:52.608
{\an1}Aw, come on, it'll keep
your head from exploding.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.275
Are you serious?

19:53.358 --> 19:56.862
You wanna see my pecker?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.781
{\an1}Oh, too late.
[laughs]

19:59.865 --> 20:05.787
[both slurping]

20:05.871 --> 20:07.414
{\an1}What the [bleep]
are you guys doing?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.458
{\an3}We're trying to maintain
peak hydration.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.335
Staying hydrated
is super important, Ashley.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.920
I want peak hydration.

20:13.003 --> 20:13.962
Here, give it a try.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.422
{\an1}[slurping]

20:15.505 --> 20:17.466
- You're doin' it.
- Oh, yeah, this is great.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.800
Suck on Roy's W.A.N.G., too.

20:18.884 --> 20:19.885
- Yes!
- Get it!

20:19.968 --> 20:22.137
- You're really hydrating.
- Both at the same time.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.180
Oh, hell yeah.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.306
{\an1}Now you suck on mine while
I suck on Roy's W.A.N.G.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.935
Okay.
[all slurping]

20:28.018 --> 20:29.144
This ain't working.

20:29.227 --> 20:31.021
I'll do yours.
Steve, you watch.

20:31.104 --> 20:31.730
- Yeah.
- Nice.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.315
Steve, suck your own W.A.N.G.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.317
{\an1}I'm on it.
[slurping]

20:35.400 --> 20:38.153
{\an3}Hell, yeah!
Peak hydration!

20:38.236 --> 20:40.155
- I'm about to peak, too.
- Go for it, man!

20:40.238 --> 20:41.949
Suck it hard, Steve!

20:42.032 --> 20:44.868
Oh, here we go!

20:44.952 --> 20:47.829
{\an3}Ho, ho!

20:47.913 --> 20:49.998
Oh, Roy, we did it, buddy.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.377
That...was...wonderful.

20:53.460 --> 20:58.340
{\an3}Oh, shit, I just pissed
all over the floor.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.845
{\an9}Oh, I get it.
Good one, guys.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.847
{\an8}Where are you?
I get the joke.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.684
{\an9}A way too expensive
hospital bill.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.894
{\an7}Are you gonna
pay that or what?

21:10.978 --> 21:11.979
{\an9}[sighs]
Suck it, me.
