A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.821
( female )
PIKE PLACE MARKET WAS BORN
IN 1907 FROM CITIZEN OUTRAGE

02:00.830 --> 02:03.219
AT THE HIGH COST
OF PRODUCE,

02:03.230 --> 02:05.824
WHEN SEATTLE CITY
COUNCILMAN THOMAS REVELLE

02:05.830 --> 02:07.695
PROPOSED A PUBLIC
STREET MARKET.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.749
ON OPENING DAY,
AUGUST 7th, 1907,

02:10.760 --> 02:14.252
EIGHT FARMERS
BROUGHT THEIR WAGONS

02:14.260 --> 02:15.989
TO THE CORNER
OF FIRST AND PIKE

02:16.000 --> 02:19.754
AND WERE OVERWHELMED BY AN
ESTIMATED 10,000 EAGER SHOPPERS.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.854
BY 11 AM. THEY WERE
COMPLETELY SOLD OUT.

02:24.530 --> 02:26.725
WELL, THAT CONCLUDES
THE MORNING HALF OF OUR TOUR.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.924
ONCE AGAIN,

02:27.930 --> 02:29.227
MY NAME'S KAREN,

02:29.230 --> 02:31.255
AND YOU'VE JUST BEEN
A SUPER-DUPER GROUP
THIS MORNING

02:31.260 --> 02:32.921
AND WE'LL SEE YOU
BACK HERE ON THE BUS

02:32.930 --> 02:34.693
AT HALF PAST
1:00.

02:37.730 --> 02:38.754
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU,

02:38.760 --> 02:40.193
BUT I COULD SURE
USE A FUCKING CIGARETTE.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.258
THANK YOU,
KAREN.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.850
OKAY, BYE.

02:50.930 --> 02:53.148
EXCUSE ME, SIR ?

02:55.160 --> 02:58.425
Sir, it's lunchtime,
you can get off the bus now.

02:58.430 --> 02:59.727
We're at
Pike Place Market !

02:59.730 --> 03:01.994
SIR !

03:09.630 --> 03:11.029
SHIT.

03:11.030 --> 03:15.194
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER DEAD ONE
BACK HERE, LARRY.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.053
( horns blaring )

03:29.730 --> 03:32.528
YOU'VE MISSED
YOUR LAST THREE SESSIONS.

03:32.530 --> 03:33.656
YEAH, WELL.

03:33.660 --> 03:35.321
SOMETIMES COMING IN HERE
TALKING ABOUT MY LIFE

03:35.330 --> 03:36.991
GETS IN THE WAY
OF ME HAVING ONE.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.958
SO, WHY'D YOU BOTHER
COMING IN TODAY THEN ?

03:39.960 --> 03:42.292
BECAUSE THEY SENT A LETTER
TO MY MOTHER

03:42.300 --> 03:44.996
AND THREATENED
TO SUSPEND ME IF I DIDN'T.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.098
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU HAD SOMETHING

03:48.100 --> 03:49.351
YOU WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.349
WITH YOU ?

03:50.360 --> 03:51.497
YEAH, RIGHT.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.253
ARE YOU ANGRY
WITH ME ?

03:54.260 --> 03:57.229
HOW CAN YOU TELL ?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.594
I WAS OBLIGATED TO COOPERATE
WITH THE POLICE, CLAIRE.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.329
IT'S MY JOB.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.355
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I WAS HERE FOR YOU,
NOT FOR THEM.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.726
THEY WANTED
TO INTERROGATE YOU ALONE.

04:07.730 --> 04:10.153
AND THEY HAVEN'T
FOUND HIM YET.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.718
IN CASE YOU'RE...

04:11.730 --> 04:12.924
CURIOUS.

04:12.930 --> 04:14.955
WELL, I'M NOT.

04:16.830 --> 04:18.229
YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM HIM ?

04:18.230 --> 04:19.652
FUCK, NO !

04:19.660 --> 04:21.696
NOT THAT
I'D TELL YOU IF I HAD.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.099
FOR THE RECORD,
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING

04:23.100 --> 04:24.658
WHEN YOU CALLED THE POLICE
THAT NIGHT, CLAIRE.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.059
I KNOW I DID
THE RIGHT THING.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.250
I DID THE RIGHT
FUCKING THING.

04:29.260 --> 04:30.921
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
IT'S COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE

04:30.930 --> 04:32.727
THAT YOU'RE FEELING
THIS ANGRY, CLAIRE.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.358
IF YOU DON'T STOP
SAYING MY NAME

04:35.360 --> 04:37.555
AT THE END OF EVERY SENTENCE,
I'M GONNA--

04:37.560 --> 04:38.356
WHAT ?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.123
I DON'T KNOW.

04:41.430 --> 04:42.658
JUST DON'T...

04:42.660 --> 04:44.651
OKAY ?

04:49.900 --> 04:51.595
YOU FEEL LIKE
THROWING SOMETHING ?

04:51.600 --> 04:53.818
EXCUSE ME ?

04:53.830 --> 04:55.457
YOU COULD, YOU KNOW,

04:55.460 --> 04:57.758
JUST PICK SOMETHING UP
OFF MY DESK AND CHUCK IT.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.298
I'M SO SURE YOU'D LET ME
TRASH SOMETHING OFF YOUR DESK.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.325
IF YOU THOUGHT
IT MIGHT HELP, I WOULD.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.555
NO, THANKS.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.656
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH GABE

05:20.660 --> 05:22.389
AND YOU'RE SCARED

05:22.400 --> 05:24.698
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM.

05:26.060 --> 05:29.393
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T GIVE
A FLYING FUCK ABOUT HIM.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.528
YOU DON'T REALLY
FEEL THAT WAY, DO YOU ?

05:34.230 --> 05:35.857
NO.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.590
I DO FEEL BETTER,
THANK YOU.

05:59.930 --> 06:02.023
HE WAS ON
ONE OF THOSE...

06:02.030 --> 06:03.759
PACKAGE BUS TOURS.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.489
HE'D BEEN GOING
ON THEM A LOT,

06:05.500 --> 06:07.491
THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR
EVER SINCE MOM DIED.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.752
SOMETIMES HE WENT
WITH HIS FRIEND, PETE.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.899
THIS TIME
HE WENT ALONE.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.825
THEY THINK HIS HEART
JUST GAVE OUT.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.821
I'M VERY SORRY.

06:18.830 --> 06:21.390
AND WHERE IS
YOUR FATHER NOW ?

06:21.400 --> 06:25.325
HE'S STILL UP THERE
IN SEATTLE.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.427
THE COLUMBIA FUNERAL HOME'S
HOLDING HIM FOR US.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.692
THEY'RE ON
RAINIER AVENUE.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.292
NOT A PROBLEM.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.951
WE CAN MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
TO HAVE HIM FLOWN BACK TO L.A.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.588
FLOWN BACK ?

06:38.600 --> 06:39.749
YES.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.091
DAD WON'T FLY.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.092
IT WAS ALWAYS A SORE SPOT
WITH MOM.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.126
SHE WANTED TO TRAVEL,
BUT DAD FLAT OUT REFUSED.

06:47.130 --> 06:49.257
AND THEN,
AFTER SHE DIED,

06:49.260 --> 06:52.127
HE STARTED TAKING ALL
THESE PACKAGE BUS TOURS.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.392
HE HAS...

06:53.400 --> 06:56.654
HAD A THING
ABOUT FLYING.

06:56.660 --> 06:57.957
HE NEVER FLEW.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.224
I'M SURE,
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES--

07:00.230 --> 07:02.323
NO, IT ISN'T WHAT
HE WOULD'VE WANTED.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.322
ISN'T THERE
SOME OTHER WAY ?

07:07.300 --> 07:09.120
WE CAN MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
TO HAVE HIM SHIPPED,

07:09.130 --> 07:11.348
VIA RAIL OR FREIGHT.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.058
LIKE FED-EX ?

07:14.060 --> 07:15.891
YOU CAN DO THAT ?

07:15.900 --> 07:17.527
IT'S DONE
ALL THE TIME.

07:17.530 --> 07:20.397
THEY BROUGHT ABRAHAM LINCOLN
HOME TO ILLINOIS BY TRAIN

07:20.400 --> 07:23.699
ALL THE WAY FROM WASHINGTON,
PACKED IN ICE.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.828
IT SHOULDN'T
BE A PROBLEM.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.224
NOW, KEITH,
I'LL BE BACK UP HERE

07:36.230 --> 07:37.925
JUST AS SOON AS YOUR FATHER'S
BACK ON HIS FEET.

07:37.930 --> 07:40.125
WHAT IF GRANDPA DIES ?

07:40.130 --> 07:44.351
MY FRIEND NEISHA'S BROTHER
HAD AN OPERATION AND HE DIED.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.023
I TOLD YOU, TAYLOR,
IT'S JUST A HERNIA.

07:48.030 --> 07:49.588
IT'S NOTHING FOR YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.023
I'D SURE LIKE TO KNOW
WHERE THE HELL KARLA IS.

07:52.030 --> 07:55.295
SHE STILL UP IN OAKLAND
WITH DERRICK ?

07:57.530 --> 07:59.998
DID SHE EVEN OFFER
TO COME BACK DOWN HERE

08:00.000 --> 08:01.956
AND TAKE CARE OF HER KID WHEN
YOU TOLD HER YOU WERE LEAVING ?

08:01.960 --> 08:05.350
WE HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM HER.

08:07.660 --> 08:09.218
JESUS.

08:10.460 --> 08:12.451
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A NUMBER FOR HER.

08:14.130 --> 08:15.552
IT'S BEEN DISCONNECTED.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.492
OH, SHIT !

08:16.500 --> 08:18.092
I TOLD YOU, KEITH,

08:18.100 --> 08:20.091
HUSH THAT KIND OF MOUTH
AROUND YOUR NIECE !

08:20.100 --> 08:23.399
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
TAKE THE CHILD WITH ME.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.789
LOOK, SHE'LL BE FINE,
ALRIGHT ?

08:25.800 --> 08:28.724
MY NEW PLACE HAS AN EXTRA ROOM,
AND BETWEEN EDDIE AND ME,

08:28.730 --> 08:30.493
WE'LL MAKE SURE SHE'S--

08:30.500 --> 08:31.899
I DON'T WANT
TO COME STAY WITH YOU.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.754
HOW COME YOU CAN'T
COME STAY HERE ?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.296
BECAUSE MY THINGS
ARE AT MY PLACE.

08:35.300 --> 08:36.927
WHAT ABOUT MY STUFF ?

08:36.930 --> 08:38.591
YOU CAN BRING IT
WITH YOU.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.329
UH-UH, YOU'D
PROBABLY STEAL IT.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.729
( horn honking )

08:41.730 --> 08:43.129
THERE'S MY CAB.

08:43.130 --> 08:46.497
TAYLOR, COME ON, HONEY,
GIVE YOUR GRANDMA A HUG.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.255
I LOVE YOU,
GRAN DMA.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.898
NOW, YOU BE GOOD.

08:55.900 --> 08:59.392
AND YOU MIND
YOUR UNCLE KEITH.

09:01.130 --> 09:03.496
I'LL TRY TO COME BACK
AS FAST AS I CAN.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.758
I KNOW A LOT WORSER WORDS
THAN "SHIT", YOU KNOW.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.058
SO DO I.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.099
SO, HOW'D THE MOSSBACK
INTAKE GO ?

09:28.100 --> 09:30.421
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A WAY
TO GET A BODY SHIPPED BACK

09:30.430 --> 09:31.988
FROM YOUR OLD
STOMPING GROUND.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.524
WHY CAN'T
YOU JUST FLY IT BACK ?

09:33.530 --> 09:35.657
THAT'S WHAT YOUR FATHER
ALWAYS DID.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.491
APPARENTLY THE DECEASED
WAS AFRAID OF FLYING.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.456
I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA
GIVE A SHIT NOW, DAVID.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.519
THE FAMILY DOESN'T
WANT HIM TO FLY.

09:41.530 --> 09:44.499
AND THE FREIGHT COMPANIES
ARE BACKED UP UNTIL NEXT WEEK,

09:44.500 --> 09:47.025
AND AMTRAK CAN'T BRING HIM
BACK UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY.

09:47.030 --> 09:49.157
NO PROBLEM.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.425
I'LL FLY UP,
RENT A REFRIGERATED VAN,
DRIVE HIM BACK.

09:52.430 --> 09:54.648
YOU DON'T NEED
A REFRIGERATED VAN,

09:54.660 --> 09:56.196
JUST A ONE-WAY RENTAL.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.497
HE'S ALREADY
BEEN EMBALMED.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.853
EVEN EASIER.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.327
YOU'D DO THAT ?

10:00.330 --> 10:02.719
FLY UP THERE, TURN AROUND
AND DRIVE ALL THE WAY BACK ?

10:02.730 --> 10:04.049
SURE.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.254
I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK
SINCE CHRISTMAS,

10:05.260 --> 10:06.397
I CAN SEE
A FEW OF FRIENDS.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.958
I STILL HAVE SOME STUFF
UP THERE, I'D LOVE TO.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.757
I SUPPOSE WE COULD
MARK UP THE COST OF SHIPPING

10:09.760 --> 10:10.988
TO COVER YOUR TRAVEL.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.228
WHEN DO YOU
WANT ME TO LEAVE ?

10:12.230 --> 10:13.356
TOMORROW ?

10:13.360 --> 10:14.793
DONE.

10:20.730 --> 10:23.494
HAVE YOU MET ANY NICE MEN
RECENTLY, DAVID ?

10:25.460 --> 10:27.325
NO ONE TO SPEAK OF.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.855
WELL, I WISH YOU'D
PUT YOURSELF OUT MORE.

10:29.860 --> 10:33.296
THE DOOR TO YOUR HOUSE ONLY
OPENS FROM THE INSIDE, YOU KNOW.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.894
( laughing )

10:35.900 --> 10:38.050
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
YOUR FRIEND, GABRIEL

10:38.060 --> 10:39.357
AROUND MUCH LATELY,
CLAIRE.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.191
SO?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.657
HAVE YOU NOT BEEN
SEEING AS MUCH OF HIM ?

10:43.660 --> 10:45.389
NO, I HAVEN'T.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.425
DID YOU TWO
HAVE A FALLING OUT ?

10:47.430 --> 10:49.819
YEAH, GABE JOINED
THE HARE KRISHNA, OKAY ?

10:49.830 --> 10:52.924
THOSE PEOPLE
WITH THE ORANGE ROBES
AND TAMBOURINES ?

10:52.930 --> 10:56.388
THAT TRY TO SELL YOU
BOOKS IN THE AIRPORT,
YEP, THAT'S THEM.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.221
OH, MY GOODNESS.

10:59.230 --> 11:02.256
HE NEVER STRUCK ME
AS A RELIGIOUS PERSON.

11:02.260 --> 11:04.455
WELL, HE IS NOW,
BIG TIME.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.223
DID HE SHAVE
HIS HEAD ?

11:06.230 --> 11:07.549
YEAH, HE SHAVED
HIS HEAD.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.393
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE, PLEASE ?

11:12.060 --> 11:15.223
CLAIRE, YOU WANNA COME UP
TO SEATTLE WITH ME ?

11:16.930 --> 11:19.490
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO COME
TO SEATTLE WITH YOU ?

11:19.500 --> 11:20.990
YEAH, WHY NOT ?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.059
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN
STICK THE MOSSBACKS

11:23.060 --> 11:24.596
WITH ANOTHER
PLANE TICKET, NATE.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.658
I'LL PAY FOR IT.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.218
YEAH.
YOU WILL ?

11:27.230 --> 11:28.458
I COULD USE THE COMPANY,
AND BESIDES,

11:28.460 --> 11:30.348
YOU CAN HELP WITH SOME
OF THE DRIVING ON THE WAY BACK.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.759
SHE'LL MISS SCHOOL.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.398
WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING
IN CLASS I CAN'T MISS,

11:33.400 --> 11:34.753
AND I CAN BRING
MY HOMEWORK WITH ME.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.796
IT'S JUST FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.596
FINE.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.421
I'M TIRED OF TRYING TO BE
THE ARCHITECT FOR THIS FAMILY.

11:43.430 --> 11:46.991
IT'S HIGH TIME YOU DREW
YOUR OWN BLUEPRINTS.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.822
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE FUCK
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ANYMORE ?

12:01.900 --> 12:04.528
WHAT ?
NATE.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.150
( urinating )
OH, HEY,
BY THE WAY,

12:12.160 --> 12:13.627
I'M FLYING UP
TO SEATTLE TOMORROW.

12:13.630 --> 12:15.154
YOU ARE ?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.354
YEAH.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.852
I'M PICKING UP A BODY
AND DRIVING IT BACK FOR DAVID.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.328
I'M GONNA
TAKE CLAIRE WITH ME.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.059
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

12:26.030 --> 12:27.520
YOU DON'T MIND
THAT I DIDN'T ASK YOU ?

12:29.360 --> 12:30.793
TO GO WITH ME.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.394
NO, NOT AT ALL.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.391
GOOD.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.690
YOU SURE ?

12:38.700 --> 12:41.419
NATE, I'M TRYING
TO READ.

12:41.430 --> 12:44.297
AND YOU KNOW I HATE IT
WHEN YOU FLOSS IN FRONT OF ME.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.922
SORRY.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.753
IS IT WEIRD
THAT I DIDN'T ASK YOU

12:52.760 --> 12:54.318
TO COME UP
TO SEATTLE WITH ME ?

12:54.330 --> 12:56.195
NO, WHY WOULD IT BE ?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.952
I DON'T KNOW.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.222
IT JUST FEELS
A LITTLE WEIRD.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.255
OKAY, NOW IT IS
A LITTLE WEIRD.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.399
BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE
MAKING IT A LITTLE WEIRD.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.152
BUT YOU'RE NOT
MAD ABOUT IT ?

13:05.160 --> 13:06.491
NOT AT ALL.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.422
I THINK IT'S REALLY
GOOD FOR YOU

13:08.430 --> 13:09.920
TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH YOUR SISTER.

13:09.930 --> 13:11.955
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

13:24.830 --> 13:26.127
YOU SURE
IT'S NOT TOO WEIRD ?

13:26.130 --> 13:28.951
OH GOD, NATE,
GIVE IT A REST.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.749
GOODNIGHT, BREN.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.897
GOODNIGHT.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.290
COOL, SLEATER-KINNEY'S
PLAYING AT THIS PLACE

14:03.300 --> 14:04.927
CALLED SHOWBOX TONIGHT.

14:04.930 --> 14:07.626
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT SHOWBOX IS 18 AND OVER.

14:07.630 --> 14:10.827
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I DON'T HAVE A FAKE I.D. ?

14:10.830 --> 14:13.321
YOU HAVE A FAKE I.D. ?

14:13.330 --> 14:16.424
YOU'RE NOT GONNA PULL SOME
PSEUDO-PARENTAL BULLSHIT

14:16.430 --> 14:17.852
ON ME, ARE YOU ?

14:17.860 --> 14:19.020
NO.

14:19.030 --> 14:20.895
I HAD A FAKE I.D.
ONCE, TOO.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.027
MAYBE I'LL
GO WITH YOU.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.555
I DON'T NEED
A BABY-SITTER, NATE.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.152
I LOVE SLEATER-KINNEY.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.129
YOU LOVE
SLEATER-KINNEY ?

14:32.400 --> 14:33.890
WOULD YOU JUST TRY TO GET
OVER YOURSELF FOR A SECOND

14:33.900 --> 14:36.323
AND LET ME BE YOUR FRIEND
AND YOUR BROTHER ?

14:41.660 --> 14:42.854
DID YOU BRING ME
ON THIS TRIP

14:42.860 --> 14:44.725
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT I NEEDED
A LITTLE DISTRACT ION ?

14:44.730 --> 14:47.551
NO, I INVITED YOU ON THIS TRIP
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN

14:47.560 --> 14:49.152
TO BRING YOU ALONG.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.219
NOW I'M HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS.

14:51.230 --> 14:52.356
OKAY.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.497
OKAY ?

14:53.500 --> 14:55.991
I BELIEVE YOU.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.019
SO, LIKE, WHERE ARE
WE STAYING ANYWAY ?

15:01.030 --> 15:02.622
MY FRIEND LISA'S.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.120
SHE AN OLD GIRLFRIEND ?

15:04.130 --> 15:05.449
NO.

15:05.460 --> 15:07.394
NO WAY,
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.949
WE WERE STRICTLY ROOMMATES,
NOTHING MORE.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.428
WORKED AT
THE CO-OP TOGETHER.

15:15.730 --> 15:18.619
IS SHE ALL CRUNCHY GRANOLA,
BACK-PACKY

15:18.630 --> 15:20.894
AND WAY INTO GRUNGE ?

15:20.900 --> 15:23.391
UM, CRUNCHY GRANOLA,

15:23.400 --> 15:25.027
MAYBE A LITTLE.

15:25.030 --> 15:26.395
BACK-PACKY,
DEFINITELY.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.493
INTO GRUNGE ?
NO WAY.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.094
GRUNGE DIED LONG BEFORE
KURT COBAIN DID.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.125
BESIDES, LISA IS...

15:33.130 --> 15:37.499
NOT SO EASY
TO CATEGORIZE.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.552
YOU GUYS DID IT A FEW TIMES,
THOUGH, RIGHT ?

15:42.560 --> 15:43.891
WE'RE NOT HAVING
THIS DISCUSSION.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.219
FINE.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.857
WELL, THIS IS IT.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.522
SWEET.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.951
I REMEMBER
A SUMMER'S DAY

16:31.760 --> 16:34.695
I REMEMBER
WALKING UP TO YOU

16:37.600 --> 16:40.194
I REMEMBER
MY FACE TURNED RED

16:42.000 --> 16:43.558
NATE !

16:43.560 --> 16:45.858
HEY, LISA !

16:45.860 --> 16:48.420
IT'S SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU BACK HOME !

16:48.430 --> 16:50.398
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

16:54.530 --> 16:55.849
LISA, THIS IS
MY SISTER, CLAIRE.

16:55.860 --> 16:57.396
CLAIRE !

17:03.660 --> 17:04.991
COME IN.

17:23.860 --> 17:25.691
HELLO, HIRAM ?

17:25.700 --> 17:27.725
IT'S ME, RUTH.

17:27.730 --> 17:30.324
I'M FINE,
HOW ARE YOU ?

17:30.330 --> 17:34.448
UM, LISTEN, THE REASON
WHY I'M CALLING IS...

17:34.460 --> 17:37.395
( laughing )

17:37.400 --> 17:39.527
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

17:39.530 --> 17:42.249
THAT I'VE BEEN DRAI-TING
A NEW BLUEPRINT FOR MYSELF.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.420
NO, NOT FOR THE HOUSE.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.796
WELL, YES,
IT IS FOR THE HOUSE,

17:47.800 --> 17:49.449
MY HOUSE.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.759
I MEAN, NOT THE ACTUAL
PHYSICAL STRUCTURE

17:52.760 --> 17:54.022
I LIVE IN
WITH MY FAMILY.

17:54.030 --> 17:55.691
I'M SPEAKING MORE OF
THE EMOTIONAL STRUCTURE

17:55.700 --> 17:58.157
IN WHICH I'VE CHOSEN
TO LIVE MY LIFE.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.824
NO!

18:00.830 --> 18:03.424
I MOST CERTAINLY
HAVE NOT BEEN DRINKING !

18:03.430 --> 18:07.150
I'M JUST TRYING
TO LET YOU KNOW, HIRAM,

18:07.160 --> 18:10.197
THAT I HARBOR NO HARD FEELINGS
AGAINST YOU, AND...

18:12.030 --> 18:13.952
NO, I DO NOT WANT
TO GET BACK TOGETHER !

18:13.960 --> 18:16.497
HOW PRESUMPTUOUS !

18:18.130 --> 18:21.395
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
HIRAM, FUCK OFF !

18:25.700 --> 18:27.099
AMELIA ?

18:27.100 --> 18:28.419
IT'S RUTH.

18:28.430 --> 18:30.694
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T
SEEN EACH OTHER IN A WHILE,

18:30.700 --> 18:33.919
AND I FEEL A LITTLE FUNNY
LEAVING THIS ON YOUR MACHINE,

18:33.930 --> 18:36.728
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

18:36.730 --> 18:40.029
I'VE BEEN DRAI-TING
A NEW BLUEPRINT FOR MYSELF

18:40.030 --> 18:42.726
AND IF YOU'RE EVER
LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY

18:42.730 --> 18:44.288
TO RENEW OUR FRIENDSHIP,

18:44.300 --> 18:46.951
MY FRONT DOOR
IS OPEN TO YOU.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.497
THAT'S ALL
I WANTED TO SAY.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.695
YOU CAN CALL ME BACK
IF YOU WANT TO, OKAY ?

18:51.700 --> 18:53.622
BYE.

18:57.430 --> 18:58.692
SARAH ?

18:58.700 --> 19:00.452
SARAH, ARE YOU THERE ?

19:00.460 --> 19:03.122
IF YOU'RE THERE,
PICK UP.

19:05.130 --> 19:06.757
OKAY, FINE.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.557
I KNOW WE DON'T TALK TO
EACH OTHER VERY MUCH ANYMORE,

19:08.560 --> 19:10.528
BUT I'VE LEI-T YOU THREE MESSAGES
IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS

19:10.530 --> 19:12.225
AND YOU HAVEN'T RETURNED
ANY OF MY CALLS.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.619
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK YOU DON'T
EVER WANT TO TALK TO ME AGAIN

19:14.630 --> 19:16.120
AND IF THAT'S
THE CASE, WELL...

19:16.130 --> 19:17.995
WE REALLY
NEED TO TALK.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.151
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO YOU

19:21.160 --> 19:22.957
ABOUT THE CRACKS
IN MY FOUNDATION

19:22.960 --> 19:25.929
AND YOUR PART
IN HELPING ME REPAIR THEM.

19:25.930 --> 19:28.592
THIS IS
YOUR SISTER RUTH.

19:41.230 --> 19:43.619
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU CAN'T ?

19:43.630 --> 19:46.292
EDDIE, I NEED YOU TO PICK UP
TAYLOR FROM SCHOOL.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.894
LOOK, I REALIZE YOU'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHIFT--

19:48.900 --> 19:51.221
CAN'T YOU JUST GET SOMEBODY
TO COVER FOR YOU ?

19:51.230 --> 19:54.119
FUCK MAN, I'M CAUGHT
BETWEEN A ROCK

19:54.130 --> 19:55.791
AND A FUCKING
HARD PLACE HERE.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.495
I NEED YOU
TO DO THIS FOR ME !

19:59.130 --> 20:01.598
ALRIGHT, NEVER MIND,
FUCK IT THEN.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.919
THIS IS
A BULLSHIT DETAIL.

20:02.930 --> 20:05.251
I WISH THE GUY WOULD JUST
SHOOT HER AND GET IT OVER WITH.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.490
I'VE GOT TICKETS
FOR THE DODGERS TONIGHT.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.125
WHAT'D I SAY ?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.195
( phone )

20:16.200 --> 20:17.827
DAVID FISHER.

20:17.830 --> 20:18.694
David ?

20:18.700 --> 20:20.349
KEITH ?

20:20.360 --> 20:21.827
YEAH, LISTEN.

20:21.830 --> 20:24.094
I GOT A HUGE FAVOR
TO ASK.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.192
WHAT IS IT ?

20:25.200 --> 20:27.225
I'M STUCK IN KOREATOWN,

20:27.230 --> 20:29.596
SOME GUY IS HOLDING
HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW HOSTAGE,

20:29.600 --> 20:32.797
CLAIMS SHE PUT HIS TV REMOTE
DOWN THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.859
I don't know when
I'm gonna get out of here.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.350
Eddie's pulling
a double shift.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.952
I HATE TO ASK, BUT...

20:37.960 --> 20:41.327
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT
YOU CAN PICK UP TAYLOR

20:41.330 --> 20:42.854
FROM RIDGEBROOK ELEMENTARY

20:42.860 --> 20:44.555
at three ?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.528
YES, I MEAN, SURE,
I'D BE GLAD TO.

20:46.530 --> 20:47.849
You sure ?

20:47.860 --> 20:49.293
YES, OF COURSE.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.894
ALRIGHT, THANKS.

20:51.900 --> 20:55.222
I'll call ahead to the school
so they'll be expecting you.

20:55.230 --> 20:58.028
I'll pick Taylor up
from your place later.

20:58.030 --> 20:59.349
GREAT.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.352
THANKS, MAN,
I OWE YOU ONE.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.622
NO PROBLEM.

21:05.660 --> 21:06.957
( phone beeping )

21:20.300 --> 21:21.392
WHAT IS THIS ?

21:21.400 --> 21:22.492
TOFU MEATLOAF.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.956
IT'S COMPLETELY VEGAN.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.450
NO DAIRY, NO EGGS,

21:25.460 --> 21:26.859
NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS
OF ANY KIND.

21:26.860 --> 21:28.748
NO MEAT ?

21:28.760 --> 21:30.352
NONE WHATSOEVER.

21:30.360 --> 21:34.091
WHY DO YOU CALL IT
"MEATLOAF" ?

21:35.130 --> 21:37.928
YOU'RE A PISSER JUST LIKE
YOUR BROTHER, AREN'T YOU ?

21:37.930 --> 21:40.626
ANYWAY, IT USED
TO BE HIS FAVORITE.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.188
IT'S DELICIOUS, LISA.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.727
I DIDN'T PUT IN
TOO MUCH GARLIC ?

21:45.730 --> 21:47.721
NO WAY.
NOT FOR ME.

21:47.730 --> 21:50.028
GARLIC IS
A MIRACLE HERB.

21:50.030 --> 21:52.749
IT HELPS LOWER CHOLESTEROL
AND BLOOD PRESSURE,

21:52.760 --> 21:54.057
IT STIMULATES
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

21:54.060 --> 21:56.824
AND IT INHIBITS THE GROWTH
OF PARASITES IN THE INTESTINES.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.122
SO, HOW'S LIFE
AT THE CO-OP ?

22:02.130 --> 22:04.894
OUR MEMBERSHIP IS UP 15%
SINCE YOU LEI-T,

22:04.900 --> 22:06.424
IN SPITE OF
THE BIGGER CORPORATE OUTFITS

22:06.430 --> 22:07.920
BREATHING DOWN
OUR NECKS.

22:07.930 --> 22:09.557
WOW, SOUNDS LIKE THINGS
ARE GOING GREAT.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.027
WE MISS YOU.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.498
YOU SHOULD STOP IN
AND SAY HELLO WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.890
SO, HOW'S LIFE
BACK IN LA. ?

22:16.900 --> 22:18.754
YOU KNOW, IT'S O.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.955
YOU KNOW,
WHAT CAN I SAY ?

22:20.960 --> 22:23.451
I MAY HAVE FINALLY FOUND
SOMETHING I'M GOOD AT.

22:23.460 --> 22:25.621
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU HAD
A SPIRITUAL CALLING.

22:25.630 --> 22:26.949
YEAH, RIGHT.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.658
WHAT ?

22:30.660 --> 22:32.992
BEING A FUNERAL DIRECTOR IS
PROOF OF A SPIRITUAL CALLING ?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.527
WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT
I IMAGINED FOR NATE, BUT...

22:36.530 --> 22:38.919
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.595
NOTHING EVER
SURPRISES YOU, LISA.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.891
THAT'S TRUE.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.292
SO, LAST TIME I SPOKE TO YOU,
BACK IN JANUARY, I SUPPOSE,

22:55.300 --> 22:57.860
YOU HAD
MET SOMEBODY ?

22:57.860 --> 22:58.952
BRENDA.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.657
YEAH, ANYTHING EVER
HAPPEN WITH THAT ?

23:04.360 --> 23:05.850
WE'RE STILL TOGETHER.

23:05.860 --> 23:07.452
WOW.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.825
EIGHT MONTHS.

23:08.830 --> 23:10.991
THAT'S GOTTA BE
AN ALL-TIME RECORD
FOR YOU, NATE.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.627
IT MIGHT BE.

23:12.630 --> 23:15.451
THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
A REAL RELATIONSHIP TO ME.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.258
WHAT CAN I SAY ?

23:19.600 --> 23:20.999
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.527
I MEAN, FOR ME,
FOR WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW,

23:24.530 --> 23:25.690
IT'S A GOOD THING.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.224
IT'S ALL GOOD.

23:27.230 --> 23:29.255
IT IS, IT'S ALL...

23:31.200 --> 23:32.849
WELL, MOSTLY,
YOU KNOW...

23:32.860 --> 23:34.828
GOOD.

23:35.860 --> 23:38.294
I'M REALLY HAPPY
FOR YOU, NATE.

23:41.230 --> 23:43.994
YOU KNOW, I GOT OFFERED
A JOB IN LA.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.756
REALLY ?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.421
YEAH, SOME BIG-TIME PRODUCER
CAME THROUGH TOWN...

23:48.430 --> 23:50.955
SHOOTING A MOVIE.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.951
SHE'S LOOKING FOR A VEGAN CHEF
AND SHE OFFERED ME A JOB.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.325
REALLY, WHAT MOVIE ?

23:54.330 --> 23:58.096
I'M NOT GOOD WITH TITLES,
I DON'T GO TO THE MOVIES.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.250
FILM IS PROCESSED
WITH GELATIN.

24:00.260 --> 24:01.522
GELATIN COMES
FROM HORSES' HOOVES.

24:01.530 --> 24:02.724
HUH.

24:02.730 --> 24:04.049
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

24:04.060 --> 24:05.288
MOST PEOPLE DON'T,

24:05.300 --> 24:07.393
HENCE THE GLOBAL
SLAVERY OF ANIMALS.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.218
WERE YOU THINKING
ABOUT TAKING THE JOB ?

24:13.230 --> 24:15.118
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,

24:15.130 --> 24:17.325
L.A. IS SUCH
A GODLESS PLACE.

24:18.330 --> 24:21.322
BESIDES, MY LIFE
IS REALLY FULL HERE.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.798
MAY I USE
YOUR BATHROOM ?

24:25.800 --> 24:28.553
YEAH, IT'S DOWN THE HALL,
FIRST DOOR ON THE LEI-T.

24:32.660 --> 24:34.127
SHE'S A LOT LIKE YOU.

24:34.130 --> 24:35.825
YOU THINK ?

24:37.960 --> 24:39.257
GOD,

24:39.260 --> 24:40.591
I'VE MISSED YOU, NATE.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.489
I'VE MISSED YOU TOO.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.425
GIVE ME A BREAK.

25:14.860 --> 25:16.953
WOW.

25:19.130 --> 25:22.054
I THINK YOU TOTALLY
CLEARED OUT MY SINUSES.

25:22.060 --> 25:24.494
NOT TOO HARD ?

25:24.500 --> 25:28.129
SOME OF MY CLIENTS
FIND ME A LITTLE INTENSE.

25:28.130 --> 25:30.257
NOT AT ALL.

25:30.260 --> 25:32.649
I LOVE IT.

25:32.660 --> 25:35.959
FEELS GREAT.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.355
I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU'RE PRETTY LOOSE.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.557
NOT A LOT OF TENSION
IN THE USUAL PLACES.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.522
I'M CURIOUS, MELISSA,
WHAT DO YOU DO ?

25:51.530 --> 25:53.498
I'M JUST
ASKING 'CAUSE

25:53.500 --> 25:56.719
I'M THINKING ABOUT
SWITCHING PROFESSIONS AND...

25:56.730 --> 25:58.823
WELL, I'M CURIOUS.

25:58.830 --> 26:01.719
I'M A PROSTITUTE.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.091
NO SHIT ?

26:09.130 --> 26:11.496
NO SHIT.

26:13.330 --> 26:14.422
WOW.

26:14.430 --> 26:16.955
COOL.

26:23.630 --> 26:24.858
HEY.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.657
I WAS JUST GONNA
MAKE A CUP OF TEA.

26:26.660 --> 26:27.695
DO YOU WANT ONE ?

26:27.700 --> 26:29.156
I'D LOVE TO, BUT...

26:29.160 --> 26:31.390
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.554
SAME TIME NEXT WEEK ?

26:35.560 --> 26:36.697

26:39.700 --> 26:41.827

26:43.360 --> 26:44.896

26:46.130 --> 26:47.222
HELLO ?

26:47.230 --> 26:48.527
Bren, hi, honey,
it's Mom.

26:48.530 --> 26:50.225
I'm at Tranquility Spa.

26:50.230 --> 26:51.925
I need you
to meet me over here.

26:51.930 --> 26:53.090
WHY ?

26:53.100 --> 26:54.658
Sweetheart,
it's an emergency.

26:54.660 --> 26:56.423
I need you
over here, please ?

26:56.430 --> 26:57.522
WHAT'S HAPPENED ?

26:57.530 --> 27:00.055
I'm at Tranquility Spa,
Brenda, in La Canada.

27:00.060 --> 27:03.291
I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't important.

27:06.300 --> 27:07.551
BRENDA !

27:07.560 --> 27:09.448
DON'T GO IN THERE !

27:09.460 --> 27:11.394
MOTHER, LET GO
OF MY FUCKING ARM !

27:11.400 --> 27:12.492
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.899
THIS IS
YOUR FATHER'S CAR.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.118
SO, DAD'S HERE,
WHO CARES ?

27:16.130 --> 27:17.995
HE'S NOT HERE,
HE'S AT WORK.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.092
I'VE CHECKED.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.227
LOOK ON THE DASH.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.727
WELL, YOUR FATHER DOESN'T
SMOKE VIRGINIA SLIMS.

27:26.730 --> 27:29.790
LOOK ON
THE GEAR SHII-T.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.191
AH, A SCRUNCHIE,
BIG FUCKING DEAL !

27:36.200 --> 27:38.327
YOUR FATHER HASN'T HAD
ENOUGH HAIR TO NEED A SCRUNCHIE

27:38.330 --> 27:40.093
SINCE 1975 !

27:40.100 --> 27:41.795
SO, YOU THINK
DAD'S FUCKING SOMEBODY.

27:41.800 --> 27:42.949
BINGO.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.291
OH, MY GOD,
IS THAT ALL THIS IS ?

27:44.300 --> 27:46.951
I THOUGHT YOU'D HEARD
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

27:46.960 --> 27:48.689
THAT SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO BILLY.

27:48.700 --> 27:51.260
DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC,
BRENDA.

27:57.630 --> 27:59.689
NOW, TAYLOR,
I HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS

27:59.700 --> 28:00.928
AND WORK
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.591
DO YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED ?

28:02.600 --> 28:04.556
CAN I HAVE
SOME CHOCOLATE MILK ?

28:04.560 --> 28:07.654
I'M SORRY, WE DON'T
HAVE ANY CHOCOLATE MILK.

28:07.660 --> 28:11.221
I WANT SOME GODDAMN
CHOCOLATE MILK !

28:12.530 --> 28:15.294
YES, WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT WE ONLY HAVE WHITE MILK.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.888
AIN'T YOU GOT ANY
OTHER COOKIES BESIDES THESE ?

28:18.900 --> 28:20.856
THOSE ARE
ALL WE HAVE.

28:20.860 --> 28:23.499
I DON'T LIKE THESE KIND,
THESE KIND TASTE LIKE SHIT.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.991
WELL THEN, JUST COLOR
IN YOUR COLORING BOOKS

28:26.000 --> 28:27.956
AND I'LL CHECK IN ON YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.258
I DON'T LIKE
COLORING BOOKS.

28:32.030 --> 28:34.498
YOU PICKED THEM OUT YOURSELF
AT THE DRUGSTORE.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.819
YOU TOLD ME
I HAD TO.

28:35.830 --> 28:37.127
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
COLORING BOOKS.

28:37.130 --> 28:39.018
I DON'T, I TOLD YOU
I LIKE TO DRAW.

28:39.030 --> 28:40.691
WELL THEN, DRAW.

28:43.130 --> 28:44.995
THESE...

28:45.000 --> 28:46.956
ARE COLORING BOOKS.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.825
YOU CAN'T DRAW
IN COLORING BOOKS

28:48.830 --> 28:51.219
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY
HAVE THE DRAWINGS IN THEM.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.256
YOU CAN ONLY COLOR
IN COLORING BOOKS.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.320
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
CALLED COLORING BOOKS.

29:04.930 --> 29:06.557
YOU WANNA
WATCH TV ?

29:06.560 --> 29:08.255
OKAY.

29:12.130 --> 29:13.290
YOU KNOW
HOW TO USE THAT ?

29:13.300 --> 29:15.188
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I'M STUPID ?

29:15.200 --> 29:16.656
I DIDN'T SAY
YOU WERE STUPID.

29:16.660 --> 29:18.423
BITCH, I KNOW
HOW TO USE A REMOTE !

29:18.430 --> 29:20.990
FINE,
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT !

29:22.300 --> 29:23.722
DUMB-ASS CRACKER !

29:25.460 --> 29:28.224
OH, MAN, I AM STARVING
FOR A CHEESEBURGER,

29:28.230 --> 29:31.290
I WANT SOMETHING THAT WALKED
THE EARTH WITH THE WORKS.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.325
MAN, I'M HAVING
A DOUBLE.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.853
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
THE MEATLESS MEATLOAF.

29:38.130 --> 29:39.427
I LIED.

29:39.430 --> 29:40.897
NO SHIT.

29:41.530 --> 29:44.522
AND WHAT'S WITH
THE "IT IS WHAT IT IS,"

29:44.530 --> 29:47.158
PURPOSEFULLY VAGUE BULLSHIT
ABOUT YOU AND BRENDA ?

29:47.160 --> 29:50.152
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT
LISA'S FEELINGS, OKAY ?

29:50.160 --> 29:54.221
YOU DEFINITELY
SLEPT WITH HER.

29:56.330 --> 29:58.389
OKAY, YES.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.193
WE HAD OCCASIONAL
SEX TOGETHER,

30:01.200 --> 30:02.849
BUT IT WAS STRICTLY
ON A FRIENDSHIP BASIS.

30:02.860 --> 30:05.749
YOU WERE
FUCK-BUDDIES ?

30:07.360 --> 30:08.327
YEAH.

30:08.330 --> 30:09.854
AND NOTHING MORE.

30:09.860 --> 30:12.522
DOES LISA KNOW THAT ?

30:14.600 --> 30:15.919
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

30:15.930 --> 30:18.398
EVERY TIME WE DID HAVE SEX,
AND I'M ONLY TALKING ABOUT FIVE,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.027
MAYBE SIX TIMES TOPS...

30:20.030 --> 30:23.454
I WAS VERY HONEST WITH HER
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT

30:23.460 --> 30:25.621
AND WHAT
IT DIDN'T MEAN.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.454
WELL, SHE'S GOT IT
BAD FOR YOU.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.991
IF YOU SAY SO.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.149
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

30:34.160 --> 30:36.651
I WANT A CHUBBY CHEESE
WITH EVERYTHING,

30:36.660 --> 30:39.549
AND MEDIUM SKINNY FRIES
AND A COKE.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.497
OH, MY GOD.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.355
DO YOU SMELL THAT ?

30:45.360 --> 30:47.248
WHAT,
BURGERS AND FRIES ?

30:47.260 --> 30:49.524
NO, IT'S LIKE
ROTTEN EGGS, JESUS.

30:49.530 --> 30:53.352
OH, MAN,
DEJA FUCKING VU.

30:53.360 --> 30:56.193
( male )
Welcome to Chubby's,
may I take your order ?

30:56.200 --> 30:59.021
YEAH, I'LL HAVE
A DOUBLE DOUB--

30:59.030 --> 31:01.351
A CHUBBY,

31:01.360 --> 31:03.453
A CHUBBY CHUBBY,
A DOUBLE DOUBLE,

31:03.460 --> 31:05.348
A CHUBBY CHUBBY,

31:05.360 --> 31:07.555
I'LL HAVE A DOUBLE DOUBLE
CHUBBY CHEESEBURGER.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.289
OH, FUCK ME !

31:09.300 --> 31:11.689
Okay, Sir,

31:11.700 --> 31:13.691
OH, JESUS, MY HEAD !

31:13.700 --> 31:14.997
NATE ?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.558
OH, FUCK !

31:18.100 --> 31:19.249
NATE !

31:27.830 --> 31:30.253
NATE, ARE YOU OKAY ?

31:31.700 --> 31:34.954
OH, FUCK !

31:39.500 --> 31:42.594
Sir, I didn't get that,
can I take your order, please ?

31:48.560 --> 31:50.528
Hello, Sir ?

31:57.060 --> 31:58.994
YOU DRIVE.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.558
I'M...

32:00.560 --> 32:02.551
I'M GONNA
GET SOME AIR.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.096
AND MAKE A PHONE CALL.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.351
OKAY.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.822
Sir, I didn't get that, can you
please repeat your order ?

32:22.830 --> 32:23.990
SHUT UP.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.025
YEAH, IS DR. DIPAOLO IN ?

32:37.760 --> 32:40.558
YEAH, YEAH,
IT'S DEFINITELY AN EMERGENCY !

32:40.560 --> 32:41.754
Sir, can I take
your order please ?

32:41.760 --> 32:42.954
SHUT THE FUCK UP !

32:42.960 --> 32:45.053
Sir, I'm going to have to
contact the manager.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.796
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.792
CAN'T WE AT LEAST
GO INSIDE ?

32:51.800 --> 32:54.018
I COULD
GET A SEAWEED WRAP

32:54.030 --> 32:55.952
WHILE I PRETEND
TO LISTEN TO YOU.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.224
THAT COULDN'T
BE HER.

32:58.230 --> 33:00.050
I'M EATING
YOUR PROTEIN BAR.

33:00.060 --> 33:02.494
MAYBE IT IS.

33:06.530 --> 33:08.623
THIS IS LIKE
EATING UPHOLSTERY.

33:10.300 --> 33:11.756
I KNEW IT.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.228
BERN COULDN'T GET ANYONE
THAT GOOD-LOOKING

33:14.230 --> 33:16.391
TO JUMP HIS SAGGY ASS.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.398
I THOUGHT YOU AND DAD
HAD AN "AGREEMENT"

33:25.400 --> 33:26.992
ABOUT THIS
SORT OF THING.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.752
WE DID.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.193
WE DO.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.452
ONLY THIS TIME,
HE BROKE ONE OF THE RULES.

33:32.460 --> 33:33.893
HE DIDN'T
TELL ME FIRST.

33:33.900 --> 33:37.051
OH, SO, YOU'RE NOT UPSET THAT
DAD'S FUCKING SOMEBODY ELSE.

33:37.060 --> 33:38.857
YOU'RE UPSET
THAT HE DIDN'T TELL YOU

33:38.860 --> 33:40.589
HE WAS FUCKING
SOMEBODY ELSE.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.192
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.725
THE RULE IS, IF YOU STEP
OUTSIDE THE HOLY BONDS,

33:44.730 --> 33:46.618
YOU HAVE TO TELL
YOUR WIFE FIRST.

33:46.630 --> 33:48.598
OH.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.524
SO, SHE CAN LINE UP
SOME YOUNG HOTTIE OF HER OWN.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.589
( laughing )

33:59.200 --> 34:01.691
WELL, I GUESS
THAT SOUNDS FAIR.

34:03.630 --> 34:04.949
YOU HAVE OTHER RULES ?

34:04.960 --> 34:07.394
A WHOLE SLEW OF THEM.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.188
GO ON, TELL ME,
I'M CURIOUS.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.954
YOU CAN'T FUCK MY FRIENDS,
I CAN'T FUCK YOURS.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.258
NO FUCKING OF
MUTUAL FRIENDS.

34:20.260 --> 34:22.194
NEVER IN HAWAII.

34:22.200 --> 34:25.454
NEVER IN A HOTEL THAT
COSTS MORE THAN $300 A NIGHT.

34:25.460 --> 34:28.918
AND NEVER IN A HOTEL
THAT'S UNDER $75 A NIGHT.

34:28.930 --> 34:30.921
( laughing )

34:32.400 --> 34:33.992
NOT ON HOLIDAYS.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.355
AND THERE ARE OTHERS,

34:36.360 --> 34:38.328
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER
ALL OF THEM AT THE MOMENT.

34:38.330 --> 34:39.490
WOW.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.024
IS ONE OF THEM,

34:41.030 --> 34:43.851
NEVER FUCK ANYBODY ELSE
IN FRONT OF YOUR KIDS ?

34:43.860 --> 34:45.191
OH, I GUESS NOT.

34:45.200 --> 34:47.122
SINCE THERE WAS THAT TIME THAT
I WATCHED YOU IN THE HOT TUB

34:47.130 --> 34:48.688
WITH SOME OLD GUY
WITH A HAIRY BACK.

34:48.700 --> 34:50.588
DARLING,
YOUR FATHER WAS THERE.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.989
AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY
NO PENETRATION,

34:53.000 --> 34:55.195
I CAN ASSURE YOU
OF THAT.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.758
YEAH, I'LL BET
THAT WASN'T YOUR CHOICE.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.751
AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN BED.

35:01.260 --> 35:04.093
I WAS ONLY GONE
A COUPLE OF HOURS, RICO.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.490
EVERY HOUR YOU'RE GONE IS
AN HOUR I HAVE TO STAY LATE.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.718
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR BUDDY'S KID,

35:09.730 --> 35:11.288
BUT I HAVE KIDS
OF MY OWN AT HOME.

35:11.300 --> 35:14.121
IS THIS ABOUT US NOT GIVING YOU
THE LOAN FOR THE HOUSE ?

35:14.130 --> 35:15.654
BECAUSE YOU NEVER
USED TO COMPLAIN

35:15.660 --> 35:17.457
ABOUT HAVING TO WORK
A LITTLE OVERTIME.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.554
THIS IS ABOUT ME NOT WANTING
TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

35:20.560 --> 35:22.289
BY MY EMPLOYERS.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.120
WE'RE MORE THAN JUST
YOUR EMPLOYERS, RICO.

35:24.130 --> 35:25.995
THAT'S BULLSHIT, DAVID,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.560
WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT,
WE'RE LIKE FAMILY.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.699
BUT IN A PINCH,
I'M JUST AN EMPLOYEE.

35:30.700 --> 35:33.191
AND YOU AND NATE
ARE JUST MY BOSSES.

35:34.330 --> 35:35.820
HEY, LITTLE LADY.

35:37.660 --> 35:38.797
TAYLOR,

35:38.800 --> 35:40.153
I TOLD YOU
TO WAIT UPSTAIRS.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.889
MY TUMMY HURTS.

35:41.900 --> 35:45.119
IS THAT MAN DEAD ?

35:49.160 --> 35:51.321
THAT MAN WAS
TOTALLY DEAD.

35:55.230 --> 35:57.698
YES, THAT MAN
WAS TOTALLY DEAD.

35:59.260 --> 36:00.625
DID YOU KILL HIM ?

36:00.630 --> 36:01.892
NO.

36:01.900 --> 36:04.494
DID THAT OTHER MAN
IN THERE KILL HIM ?

36:04.500 --> 36:05.421
NO.

36:05.430 --> 36:08.490
HE DIED OF
NATURAL CAUSES.

36:09.860 --> 36:11.589
MY FRIEND
RENEE SAID,

36:11.600 --> 36:13.898
SOONER OR LATER,
WE'LL ALL BE DEAD.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.490
THAT'S TRUE.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.799
SO, SOMEDAY I'LL BE DEAD
LAYING ON A TABLE LIKE THAT ?

36:20.800 --> 36:23.428
NOT FOR A VERY,
VERY LONG TIME.

36:24.260 --> 36:25.989
MY MOM SAYS

36:26.000 --> 36:28.753
MY DAD'S GOOD AS DEAD
AS FAR AS SHE'S CONCERNED.

36:29.660 --> 36:34.097
YES, WELL, THAT'S JUST HER WAY
OF EXPRESSING ANGER AT HIM

36:34.100 --> 36:37.228
FOR NOT BEING AROUND.

36:37.230 --> 36:41.348
SOMETIMES MY MOM SAYS
SHE WISHES SHE WAS DEAD.

36:43.830 --> 36:45.127
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT PEOPLE SAY

36:45.130 --> 36:47.951
WHEN THEY'RE UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING.

36:49.030 --> 36:50.850
DID THAT DEAD MAN
IN THERE HAVE ANY KIDS ?

36:50.860 --> 36:52.327
YEAH.

36:52.330 --> 36:55.049
HE HAD A WIFE
AND THREE CHILDREN,

36:55.060 --> 36:56.994
AND FIVE GRANDCHILDREN.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.798
I DON'T EVER
WANNA DIE.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.360
ME, NEITHER.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.428
IT'S CALLED
ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.352
"AVM" FOR SHORT.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.796
LOTS OF PEOPLE
HAVE IT THEIR WHOLE LIVES
AND NEVER EVEN KNOW.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.688
AND THE PILLS ?

37:20.230 --> 37:22.494
ARE AN ANTI-SEIZURE
MEDICATION.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.588
SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,
THAT WAS A SEIZURE ?

37:26.600 --> 37:27.794
SORT OF.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.392
SORT OF ?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.152
IT WAS A MILD SEIZURE.

37:32.830 --> 37:35.196
DOES DAVID
KNOW ABOUT THIS ?

37:35.200 --> 37:36.519
YES, HE DOES.

37:36.530 --> 37:38.828
BUT I DON'T WANT MOM TO KNOW,
'CAUSE SHE'LL JUST FREAK OUT.

37:38.830 --> 37:41.298
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
I PROMISE.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.355
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
DON'T JUST SPAZ OUT

37:45.360 --> 37:48.227
AND HORK ALL OVER THEIR SHOES
FOR NO GOOD REASON, NATE.

37:48.230 --> 37:49.925
TWO WORDS.

37:49.930 --> 37:52.251
TOFU MEATLOAF.

37:53.530 --> 37:55.327
LOOK, BESIDES, NOW THAT
I HAVE THESE PILLS,

37:55.330 --> 37:56.558
IT'LL BE TOTALLY
UNDER CONTROL.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.596
YOU SWEAR ?

37:58.600 --> 38:00.022
I SWEAR.

38:00.030 --> 38:03.796
I JUST HAVE TO TAKE THEM
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, IS ALL.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.553
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.256
JUST DO ME A FAVOR AND DON'T
TELL DAVID ABOUT THIS, OKAY ?

38:19.930 --> 38:22.319
THIS CLIENT OF MINE
IS A PROSTITUTE.

38:22.330 --> 38:24.195
SO, IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO SHOCK ME ?

38:24.200 --> 38:25.724
WHAT ?

38:25.730 --> 38:28.995
GOD, NOT EVERYTHING
IS ABOUT YOU !

38:29.000 --> 38:31.719
YOU'RE SUCH
A CLASSIC NARCISSIST.

38:31.730 --> 38:34.255
BRENDA, JUST BECAUSE
YOUR PARENTS ARE SHRINKS,

38:34.260 --> 38:36.421
DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY.

38:36.430 --> 38:38.091
AND JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE A SHRINK,

38:38.100 --> 38:40.591
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT
OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND.

38:42.800 --> 38:46.190
YOU KNOW, I'VE TREATED SEVERAL
PROSTITUTES OVER THE YEARS.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.350
AND THEY'RE NOT AS
UNCOMMON AS YOU--

38:48.360 --> 38:50.123
OH!

38:52.530 --> 38:54.122
THAT'S HER ?

38:54.130 --> 38:56.826
SHE'S YOUR AGE.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.152
I HAVE TO TALK TO HER.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.923
OH, MOM, DON'T,
PLEASE, DON'T.

39:00.930 --> 39:03.228
WAIT, WAIT,
I'M NOT ANGRY.

39:03.230 --> 39:04.697
I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE A SCENE.

39:04.700 --> 39:06.952
I JUST NEED TO PERSONALIZE
THE EXPERIENCE

39:06.960 --> 39:08.598
AND HUMANIZE
THE SITUATION.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.227
IT'S FOR
ALL OF US.

39:10.230 --> 39:12.221
YOU'LL JUST
REGRET IT !

39:13.030 --> 39:14.588
MISS...

39:14.600 --> 39:16.329
OH, MISSY ?

39:17.600 --> 39:19.818
HELLO, I'M MARGARET,
BERN'S WIFE.

39:22.530 --> 39:26.022
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
IT'S OKAY WITH ME.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.497
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'D LOVE TO CHAT,

39:27.500 --> 39:28.853
BUT I'VE GOTTA GO
MEET BERN FOR LUNCH.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.727
( laughing )

39:31.730 --> 39:35.120
(female screaming )

39:36.030 --> 39:37.827
GET OFF, YOU BITCH !

39:37.830 --> 39:39.650
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU !

39:44.230 --> 39:46.721
I'LL SEE YOU
IN HELL !

39:50.230 --> 39:52.095
I HOPE YOU
LIKE HERPES !

40:05.360 --> 40:08.193
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
SHE'D BE MORE EVOLVED.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.792
EVOLVED ?!

40:09.800 --> 40:12.291
MOTHER, YOU JUST
ATTACKED THAT WOMAN !

40:12.300 --> 40:13.358
REPEATEDLY.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.453
SHE COULD HAVE YOU
THROWN IN JAIL !

40:15.460 --> 40:17.348
I SERIOUSLY
DOUBT THAT.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.220
ARE YOU HUNGRY ?

40:22.230 --> 40:25.449
WHY AM I HERE ?

40:26.500 --> 40:29.025
WHY WAS IT NECESSARY
FOR ME TO BE HERE

40:29.030 --> 40:30.497
WITH YOU FOR THIS ?

40:30.500 --> 40:33.389
BECAUSE YOU NEEDED
A FUCKING AUDIENCE !

40:35.000 --> 40:37.150
NOT EVERYTHING'S
ABOUT YOU, BRENDA.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.058
LOOK AT MOMMY,

40:38.060 --> 40:39.948
ISN'T MOMMY PRETTY ?

40:39.960 --> 40:41.757
ISN'T MOMMY FABULOUS,

40:41.760 --> 40:43.318
AND FREE-SPIRITED,

40:43.330 --> 40:44.490
AND UNINHIBITED ?

40:44.500 --> 40:45.626
VALIDATE MOM MY, KIDS,

40:45.630 --> 40:47.598
BECAUSE SHE'S INCAPABLE
OF DOING IT HERSELF.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.591
NO WONDER BILLY
ENDED UP IN A PSYCH WARD,

40:49.600 --> 40:51.022
NOT THAT YOU CARE.

40:51.030 --> 40:53.248
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
MISS HIGH AND MIGHTY,

40:53.260 --> 40:54.522
THIS IS LIFE.

40:54.530 --> 40:56.896
PEOPLE HAVE CRISES.

40:56.900 --> 40:58.299
THEY PUSH EACH
OTHER'S BUTTONS,

40:58.300 --> 41:00.393
THEY INFLICT PAIN
ON ONE ANOTHER.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.153
AND ONCE
IN A FUCKING BLUE MOON...

41:03.160 --> 41:05.594
THEY BRING OUT
THE BEST IN EACH OTHER.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.990
BUT MOSTLY,
THEY BRING OUT THE WORST.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.293
YOU'RE PATH ETIC.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.619
DON'T YOU DARE
JUDGE ME.

41:14.630 --> 41:17.326
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE PARAGON
OF MENTAL HEALTH ?

41:17.330 --> 41:18.399
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN DATING

41:18.400 --> 41:20.254
THE SAME MAN FOR
THE PAST FEW MONTHS ?

41:20.260 --> 41:23.559
THAT'S REAL, COMPARED TO WHAT
YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE ?

41:23.560 --> 41:25.391
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.958
OF WHAT ?

41:26.960 --> 41:29.155
THE FACT THAT
I HAVEN'T ALLOWED YOU

41:29.160 --> 41:32.197
TO TOTALLY DESTROY MY LIFE LIKE
YOU HAVE EVERYBODY ELSE'S !

41:32.200 --> 41:33.553
WHAT LIFE ?

41:33.560 --> 41:37.428
YOU'VE SPENT 32 YEARS

41:37.430 --> 41:39.648
BEING YOUR LITTLE
BROTHER'S NURSEMAID.

41:39.660 --> 41:40.797
OH, FUCK YOU !

41:40.800 --> 41:43.291
TO AVOID HAVING ANY
EMOTIONAL LIFE OF YOUR OWN.

41:43.300 --> 41:46.497
AND NOW
THAT HE'S BEEN PUT AWAY,

41:46.500 --> 41:49.628
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FACE YOUR OWN DEMONS,

41:49.630 --> 41:51.052
AND SWEETHEART ?

41:51.060 --> 41:53.051
THEY'RE LEGION.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.851
GET OUT OF MY CAR.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.920
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO.

42:22.430 --> 42:24.751
I HOPE YOU LIKE PORK ROAST
AND MASHED POTATOES.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.625
THEY'RE OKAY.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.593
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
DEAR ?

42:29.600 --> 42:31.295
TO WATCH TV.

42:31.300 --> 42:34.519
IN THIS HOUSE,
WE EAT DINNER AT THE TABLE.

42:34.530 --> 42:37.397
YOU DON'T WATCH TV
WHILE YOU EAT ?

42:37.400 --> 42:39.425
NO, WE DON'T.

42:39.430 --> 42:41.898
MAYBE WE CAN WATCH SOME TV
WHEN WE'RE DONE EATING.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.221
SO, WHAT GRADE
ARE YOU IN, TAYLOR ?

42:50.230 --> 42:51.652
FOURTH.

42:51.660 --> 42:53.423
OH!

42:53.430 --> 42:56.627
DAVID WAS IN
THE FOURTH GRADE ONCE.

42:58.330 --> 43:00.195
IT'S TRUE.

43:01.800 --> 43:05.099
DID YOU KNOW DAVID USED TO BE
MY UNCLE KEITH'S BOYFRIEND ?

43:07.200 --> 43:09.293
YES, I DID.

43:11.930 --> 43:13.420
SOMETIMES...

43:13.430 --> 43:15.796
MY MOMMA CALLS MY UNCLE KEITH
A PUNK-ASS FUDGE-PACKER.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.688
'CAUSE HE LIKES MEN
INSTEAD OF WOMEN.

43:17.700 --> 43:20.999
I GUESS THAT MAKES YOU
A PUNK-ASS FUDGE-PACKER,

43:21.000 --> 43:22.558
TOO, DON'T IT ?

43:22.560 --> 43:25.688
WE DON'T USE THOSE KINDS
OF WORDS AT THIS TABLE.

43:25.700 --> 43:28.498
IN FACT, WE DON'T USE
THOSE KINDS OF WORDS AT ALL.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.751
HOW COME ?

43:29.760 --> 43:31.819
WELL, BECAUSE
THOSE WORDS ARE--

43:31.830 --> 43:33.354
HATEFU L.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.827
THOSE ARE
HATEFUL WORDS.

43:34.830 --> 43:36.525
WHAT WORDS
DO YOU USE ?

43:40.160 --> 43:42.151
HOMOSEXUAL.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.158
MY UNCLE KEITH
HAS A NEW BOYFRIEND.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.718
HIS NAME'S EDDIE.

43:49.730 --> 43:52.699
HE DRIVES AN AMBULANCE,
BUT I DON'T LIKE HIM TOO MUCH.

43:52.700 --> 43:54.554
WHY NOT ?

43:54.560 --> 43:56.926
HE LOOKS AT HIMSELF
IN THE MIRROR A LOT

43:56.930 --> 43:59.296
AND HE TALKS TO ME
LIKE I'M STUPID.

43:59.300 --> 44:01.052
I'M SURE
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

44:01.060 --> 44:02.857
YES, IT IS.

44:02.860 --> 44:05.829
WELL, IT IS TRUE.

44:05.830 --> 44:10.028
SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO CHILDREN.

44:11.230 --> 44:12.697
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

44:20.900 --> 44:22.959
I THINK
I'LL START THE DISHES.

44:38.030 --> 44:40.726
( Lisa )
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO LEAVE NOW !

44:40.730 --> 44:41.890
GO!

44:44.760 --> 44:45.988
GO!

44:48.730 --> 44:50.288
GO!

44:50.300 --> 44:52.120
GO!

44:54.630 --> 44:56.427
IS EVERYTHING OKAY ?

44:56.430 --> 44:58.921
OH, CLAIRE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TAKING A NAP.

44:58.930 --> 45:01.023
I WAS READING.

45:01.030 --> 45:03.225
WHERE'S NATE ?

45:03.230 --> 45:05.721
HE'S OUTSIDE
MAKING A PHONE CALL.

45:07.960 --> 45:10.349
WHO WERE
YOU TALKING TO ?

45:12.100 --> 45:13.249
ANTS.

45:13.260 --> 45:15.023
I'M BEING
OVERRUN BY THEM.

45:15.030 --> 45:17.851
AT FIRST I TRIED SETTING
A LITTLE FOOD ASIDE FOR THEM

45:17.860 --> 45:19.088
NEXT TO THE BACK DOOR.

45:19.100 --> 45:21.921
THEN I TRIED COAXING THEM OUT
WITH SOME CITRUS OIL.

45:21.930 --> 45:24.319
NOW I'M TRYING
TO REASON WITH THEM.

45:27.100 --> 45:28.954
AT HOME, MY DAD USED TO SQUIRT
THEM WITH LIGHTER FLUID

45:28.960 --> 45:30.655
AND TORCH THEM.

45:34.800 --> 45:37.724
I'M NOT STILL
IN LOVE WITH YOUR BROTHER,

45:37.730 --> 45:39.322
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

45:39.330 --> 45:42.026
ACTUALLY, I WASN'T
THINKING THAT.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.049
I USED TO BE.

45:46.060 --> 45:50.099
I USED TO THINK ONE DAY HE WOULD
REALIZE I WAS THE ONE FOR HIM.

45:50.100 --> 45:52.557
BUT HE NEVER HAS.

45:55.160 --> 45:56.718
DO YOU THINK
HE EVER WILL ?

45:56.730 --> 46:01.451
I'M PROBABLY NOT THE PERSON
TO BE ASKING THAT QUESTION.

46:03.200 --> 46:04.929
HE'S MY BROTHER AND ALL,
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

46:04.930 --> 46:06.591
I'M JUST GETTING
TO KNOW THE GUY.

46:08.430 --> 46:10.819
WELL, HE'S A HEARTBREAKER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

46:10.830 --> 46:14.721
THERE ARE A DOZEN WOMEN
ALL OVER SEATTLE WHO WOULD FREAK

46:14.730 --> 46:16.254
IF THEY KNEW
HE WAS BACK HERE.

46:16.260 --> 46:19.252
YOU MUST THINK
I'M SO STUPID.

46:19.260 --> 46:21.194
NO, I DON'T.

46:23.430 --> 46:24.692
DO YOU
HAVE A BOYFRIEND ?

46:24.700 --> 46:25.951
NO.

46:25.960 --> 46:29.088
NOT ANYMORE.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.852
WE BROKE UP.

46:34.130 --> 46:35.825
YOU'RE BETTER OFF,
TRUST ME.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.151
FUCKIN' ANTS.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.594
I JUST WANTED TO HEAR
HOW YOUR DAY WENT.

46:42.600 --> 46:45.797
MY MOTHER PRACTICALLY
BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF A WOMAN

46:45.800 --> 46:47.119
IN A PARKING LOT,

46:47.130 --> 46:48.597
but apart from that,
I'm fine.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.056
How's Seattle ?

46:50.060 --> 46:52.290
SEATTLE'S GOOD.

46:52.300 --> 46:53.324
WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER

46:53.330 --> 46:54.752
TRYING TO BEAT THE SHIT
OUT OF SOMEBODY ?

46:54.760 --> 46:57.194
OH, I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE
RELIVING IT RIGHT NOW.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.589
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH CLAIRE ?

46:59.600 --> 47:02.819
YEAH, GREAT,
WE'RE GETTING ALONG GREAT.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.822
IS EVERYTHING OKAY ?

47:06.830 --> 47:10.357
NO, I JUST
HAVE A HEADACHE.

47:12.530 --> 47:14.896
WE'RE GONNA HIT THE ROAD
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

47:14.900 --> 47:17.425
OKAY, WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

47:17.430 --> 47:19.227
Yep.

47:20.300 --> 47:23.451
LISTEN, NATE, I JUST RAN A BATH
AND IT'S GETTING COLD, SO...

47:24.500 --> 47:26.092
I MISS YOU.

47:28.230 --> 47:30.357
I MISS YOU, TOO.

48:00.860 --> 48:02.919
( knocking )

48:13.260 --> 48:14.921
HEY.

48:14.930 --> 48:16.921
HI.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.955
YOU NEVER CALLED.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.829
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE I LIVE ?

48:24.830 --> 48:26.252
WELL...

48:26.260 --> 48:29.229
THAT'S REALLY
NOT IMPORTANT.

48:30.700 --> 48:33.999
I THINK MAYBE IT IS.

48:36.430 --> 48:38.728
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ?

48:41.700 --> 48:43.691
SHOW ME.

49:04.030 --> 49:08.729
( moaning )

49:27.430 --> 49:29.125
SHE GIVE YOU
A HARD TIME ?

49:29.130 --> 49:32.293
NOT REALLY.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.160
LET ME GRAB HER
AND WE'LL GET OUT OF YOUR WAY.

49:45.300 --> 49:46.790
THAN KS, AGAIN.

49:46.800 --> 49:49.018
IT'S NO PROBLEM
WHATSOEVER, SHE'S...

49:49.030 --> 49:51.919
SHE'S A GREAT KID, KEITH,
SHE REALLY IS.

49:51.930 --> 49:54.228
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
SHE'S BEEN PUT THROUGH,

49:54.230 --> 49:55.754
IT'S KIND OF A MIRACLE.

49:57.530 --> 49:58.895
WELL, WE SHOULD GO.

50:05.760 --> 50:06.897
OH, YEAH.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.956
GOODNIGHT, DAVID.

50:18.430 --> 50:20.159
( door closing )

50:34.230 --> 50:35.891
( door opening )

50:37.700 --> 50:39.554
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
NEED AN EXTRA QUILT.

50:41.030 --> 50:42.793
IT GETS COLD
IN THIS ROOM.

50:42.800 --> 50:45.018
THAN KS, LISA.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.393
ARE YOU OKAY ?

50:51.400 --> 50:52.321
YEAH.

50:52.330 --> 50:54.594
I'M FINE.

50:54.600 --> 50:55.726
ARE YOU SURE ?

50:55.730 --> 50:57.823
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

50:59.900 --> 51:01.424
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME, NATE.

51:01.430 --> 51:03.728
I KNOW YOU TOO WELL.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.090
I'M FINE.

51:17.060 --> 51:20.826
( sobbing )

51:22.330 --> 51:24.594
OH, POOR BABY.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.750
IT'S OKAY.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.728
I'M HERE.

51:28.730 --> 51:31.028
I'M RIGHT HERE.

51:31.960 --> 51:34.190
IT'S OKAY.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.220
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ANY BREAKFAST ?

51:51.230 --> 51:52.322
OH, NO, I'M GOOD.

51:52.330 --> 51:53.627
I NEVER
EAT BREAKFAST.

51:53.630 --> 51:57.259
LISA, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY OLD BROWN FLANNEL SHIRT ?

51:57.260 --> 52:00.821
I'M PRETTY SURE IT GOT DONATED
TO THE CO-OP GARAGE SALE.

52:00.830 --> 52:01.990
NO...

52:02.000 --> 52:04.457
HERE IT IS.

52:06.360 --> 52:08.021
OH, I LOVE THAT SHIRT.

52:08.030 --> 52:09.793
IT'S SO NATE.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.427
WHY DON'T YOU
HANG ONTO IT ?

52:13.430 --> 52:14.692
NO, I COULDN'T.

52:14.700 --> 52:17.225
NO, COME ON,
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

52:17.230 --> 52:18.788
IT'S YOUR SHIRT,
WHAT WOULD I WANT WITH IT ?

52:18.800 --> 52:20.051
WOULD YOU
JUST KEEP IT ?

52:23.360 --> 52:25.021
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
HIT THE ROAD.

52:25.030 --> 52:26.657
WE'VE GOT TO PICK UP
MR. MOSSBACK.

52:26.660 --> 52:28.218
RIGHT.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.022
LISA ?

52:32.030 --> 52:34.396
AS ALWAYS,
IT'S BEEN GREAT...

52:34.400 --> 52:36.288
SEEING YOU.

52:36.300 --> 52:37.995
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, NATE.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.025
YOU, TOO.

52:41.860 --> 52:43.020
IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU.

52:43.030 --> 52:45.498
NICE MEETING YOU,
CLAIRE.

52:53.700 --> 52:55.019
THAN KS.

53:03.830 --> 53:05.388
MORNING, MOM.

53:06.230 --> 53:09.051
IT'S AWFULLY QUIET AROUND HERE
WITH NATE AND CLAIRE BEING GONE.

53:09.060 --> 53:11.722
I SUPPOSE IT IS.

53:13.330 --> 53:16.891
WHAT TIME DID YOUR FRIEND
COME BY TO PICK UP HIS NIECE ?

53:16.900 --> 53:19.494
HALF PAST ONE.

53:19.500 --> 53:23.049
THAT'S AWFULLY LATE FOR
A CHILD HER AGE TO BE UP.

53:23.060 --> 53:25.494
SHE WAS ASLEEP
IN THE SUN PORCH.

53:25.500 --> 53:27.149
OH.

53:31.930 --> 53:34.319
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO ME, MOM ?

53:34.330 --> 53:35.820
NO.

53:37.900 --> 53:39.720
YES, YES, THERE IS.

53:41.100 --> 53:42.920
I'M ALL EARS.

53:42.930 --> 53:46.593
YOUR FATHER USED TO SAY THAT
TO ME ALL THE TIME,

53:46.600 --> 53:48.352
"I'M ALL EARS."

53:48.360 --> 53:51.693
SOMETIMES YOU
REMIND ME OF HIM.

53:53.200 --> 53:54.792
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND ?

53:58.260 --> 54:00.649
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
WITH CHILDREN, DAVID,

54:00.660 --> 54:03.925
BECAUSE THEIR BLUEPRINTS
ARE STILL BEING DRAl-TED

54:03.930 --> 54:07.320
BY THE ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES
AND THIS LITTLE GIRL...

54:10.060 --> 54:11.925
WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT HER FOUNDATION

54:11.930 --> 54:15.149
IS PROBABLY UNSTABLE ENOUGH
WITHOUT YOU BRINGING YOUR...

54:16.630 --> 54:18.154
MY WHAT ?

54:18.160 --> 54:22.199
WELL, YOUR "RELATIONSHIP"
WITH HER UNCLE,

54:22.200 --> 54:23.724
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

54:23.730 --> 54:26.119
MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONFUSING
TO SOMEONE HER AGE.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.719
MOM...

54:31.760 --> 54:35.127
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU IF
THIS WHOLE PLAN THING OF YOURS

54:35.130 --> 54:37.690
HAS ENABLED YOU TO
"DRAl-T YOUR OWN BLUEPRINT"

54:37.700 --> 54:41.522
OR "PATCH UP SOME OF THE CRACKS
IN YOUR FOUNDATION", BUT...

54:41.530 --> 54:43.589
JUST BETWEEN
YOU AND ME,

54:43.600 --> 54:45.727
YOU'RE STARTING TO
SOUND LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

54:47.660 --> 54:49.855
AND I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU KEPT THAT SHIT TO YOURSELF

54:49.860 --> 54:51.851
AND MINDED YOUR OWN
FUCKING BUSINESS.

54:59.730 --> 55:01.857
( door closing )

55:17.500 --> 55:19.229
THANK YOU.

55:32.330 --> 55:34.298
OKAY, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD
DRIVING A DEAD GUY

55:34.300 --> 55:35.949
ALL THE WAY
BACK TO L.A.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.894
IT'S ONLY WEIRD
IF YOU MAKE IT WEIRD.

55:40.260 --> 55:41.852
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

55:41.860 --> 55:44.192
IT'S NOT.

55:48.260 --> 55:50.854
YOU KNOW, NATE,
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT...

55:50.860 --> 55:52.327
IT'S COMFORTING TO KNOW

55:52.330 --> 55:54.298
YOU'RE JUST AS FUCKED UP
AS THE REST OF US.

55:54.300 --> 55:56.951
I'M NOT ANYWHERE NEAR AS
FUCKED UP AS THE REST OF YOU.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.222
YOU ARE.

55:58.230 --> 55:59.128
I'M NOT.

55:59.130 --> 56:01.621
YES, YOU ARE.

56:01.630 --> 56:03.222
SHUT UP AND DRIVE.

56:15.400 --> 56:18.927
YOU ARE MORE POWERFUL
AND YET

56:18.930 --> 56:22.229
NOBODY KNOWS

56:22.230 --> 56:27.020
LET'S NOT FORGET
TO DISCUSS ALL

56:27.030 --> 56:30.329
OF THE...

56:30.330 --> 56:33.720
HERE IS
THE CAR YOU DRIVE

56:33.730 --> 56:38.053
WINDOW IS
OPEN WIDE

56:38.060 --> 56:42.690
MANY NICE FOLKS
SUGGEST THAT WE

56:42.700 --> 56:46.056
GO FOR A DRIVE

56:46.060 --> 56:51.453
BUT TIME DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S TIME FOR US ALL TO KNOW

56:53.930 --> 56:58.799
BUT TIME DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S TIME FOR US ALL TO KNOW

57:04.860 --> 57:08.648
TIME DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S TIME
FOR US ALL TO KNOW

57:11.660 --> 57:16.495
TIME DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S TIME FOR US ALL TO KNOW

57:19.430 --> 57:24.857
TIME DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S TIME
FOR US ALL TO KNOW

57:27.560 --> 57:32.623
TIME DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S TIME FOR US
ALL TO KNOW
