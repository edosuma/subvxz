WEBVTT

01:21.583 --> 01:23.291
(heart beating)

01:31.917 --> 01:35.333
(Monroe breathing heavy)

01:35.417 --> 01:37.542
- How did I not see that?

01:40.709 --> 01:44.542
(alien roar)

02:19.917 --> 02:23.125
(distant police siren wailing)

02:25.083 --> 02:27.542
(dog barking)

02:30.959 --> 02:33.667
(nails tapping)

02:40.417 --> 02:43.250
- Hey, I'm not here to protect
your drink.

02:43.333 --> 02:46.041
While you were gone, this guy
drank it.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.083
(faint muddled television
broadcast)

02:49.166 --> 02:50.417
- Gimme another.

02:52.917 --> 02:56.208
(Mikhail sighs)

02:57.375 --> 03:01.291
- I'm sorry, mister, I
thought it was free drink.

03:02.375 --> 03:03.583
- Nothing's free anymore.

03:04.041 --> 03:05.458
- I will pay.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.583
I have no money.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.458
- Forget it.

03:17.542 --> 03:20.166
- But I would like to buy you
drink.

03:21.542 --> 03:22.250
- I'll buy you one.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.250
What are you having?

03:26.333 --> 03:27.375
- Tequila.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.709
- We get a shot of Titanium
please?

03:29.792 --> 03:31.417
(bottles clanking)

03:35.041 --> 03:37.041
(bottles clanking)

03:37.125 --> 03:40.375
(speaking in a foreign language)

03:46.000 --> 03:47.917
Thank you, mister uh--

03:48.000 --> 03:48.875
- Monroe.

03:50.458 --> 03:51.625
-  Monroe.

03:56.917 --> 03:59.542
(clanking above on stairwell)

03:59.625 --> 04:01.083
(heavy breathing)

04:02.125 --> 04:04.083
Would you
like to see my friends?

04:04.834 --> 04:06.959
- No time, gotta meet someone.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.667
- I will make fast.

04:21.208 --> 04:23.875
- How long you had those guys?

04:23.959 --> 04:24.542
- This one is not guy.

04:26.291 --> 04:27.792
This one is girl.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.417
His girl.

04:31.542 --> 04:34.834
Usually, Putin waits

04:34.917 --> 04:38.125
until Gorbachev is eating.

04:38.959 --> 04:42.834
And then when his back is
turned,

04:42.917 --> 04:45.125
he has his way with Ana.

04:47.792 --> 04:50.625
Maybe you can see when you have
more time.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.959
Would you like to kiss Ana?

04:58.041 --> 04:59.041
- No thanks.

04:59.125 --> 04:59.792
- Make sure you take your
friends with you

04:59.875 --> 05:02.083
when you leave.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.959
- Da, Yelena.

05:07.917 --> 05:09.959
(sighs)

05:17.250 --> 05:19.792
I like you, Mr.
Monroe.

05:21.125 --> 05:23.166
One more before you go.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.291
- Think I need to take a leak.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.375
- Think I'll take it outside.

05:37.458 --> 05:39.417
-  Citizens
throughout the Western Territory

05:39.500 --> 05:41.583
gathered today to remember
the loss of human lives

05:41.667 --> 05:43.917
resulting from the virus.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
(metal clanking on stairwell)

05:54.250 --> 05:58.000
(moving to dramatic music)

06:01.917 --> 06:05.250
Thought that you said bye to me.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.041
(gun firing)

06:06.125 --> 06:09.000
(Monroe grunting)

06:09.083 --> 06:11.792
(stab thudding)

06:15.333 --> 06:18.667
(train whistle blaring)

06:19.125 --> 06:22.500
(train rattling)

06:32.542 --> 06:33.041
-  Speaking
in Chinese.

06:33.125 --> 06:37.000
(car alarm beeping)

06:40.875 --> 06:44.625
Next train arriving at Midtown
Station in four minutes.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.625
(monitor whirring)

06:50.709 --> 06:53.166
-  4112 standby.

06:55.375 --> 06:56.959
(Harrison sighs)

06:57.041 --> 06:58.750
Good evening, Harry.

06:58.834 --> 07:03.542
You have six priority messages
from Chief Inspector Carter.

07:07.166 --> 07:10.625
(electronic beeping)

07:12.500 --> 07:12.917
- Call Carter.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.709
(phone beeping)

07:17.875 --> 07:18.291
-  Harrison?

07:18.375 --> 07:19.667
-  Yeah.

07:19.750 --> 07:20.583
-  Where have you been?

07:22.417 --> 07:23.709
-  Off the grid.

07:23.792 --> 07:25.208
Call it a vacation.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.333
-  Next time you go on
vacation,

07:26.417 --> 07:28.750
do me a favor and let me know.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.417
-  Not my job to anymore.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.125
Besides--

07:31.208 --> 07:32.417
-  Monroe was hit.

07:35.792 --> 07:36.542
-  How bad?

07:37.917 --> 07:40.166
(train whirring)

07:40.250 --> 07:41.125
Carter?

07:42.083 --> 07:44.375
-  He didn't make it.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.542
Taft wants to meet.

07:48.625 --> 07:49.500
- When?

07:51.375 --> 07:54.625
-  I'll forward
you the location and time.

08:10.458 --> 08:14.250
-  Monroe's data scan came
back

08:14.333 --> 08:16.750
with traces of Dropa DNA.

08:16.834 --> 08:18.125
-  So what brought it
out?

08:18.208 --> 08:20.208
-  Oh what the hell
are you asking me for?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.625
I mean survival instincts I
guess.

08:23.542 --> 08:25.625
They're damn flesh pods, Harry.

08:25.709 --> 08:28.667
Who the hell knows why
they do what they do?

08:28.750 --> 08:30.125
-  You got a tracker on
this Dropa?

08:30.208 --> 08:33.125
-  (sighs) Not yet.

08:35.332 --> 08:36.750
-  So what do you need
from me?

08:37.708 --> 08:41.792
- Well, Monroe had this on him.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.750
It's a cell number, untraceable.

08:46.834 --> 08:51.083
So I want you to go back to the
Dry Dock.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.834
Bartender may know something.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.583
Poke around, ask some questions,
dig.

08:56.667 --> 08:57.834
It's what you're good at.

08:59.000 --> 08:59.959
That's your gift.

09:01.166 --> 09:05.875
- So I'm your tracker?

09:06.875 --> 09:09.083
I'm not even sure I
have that gift anymore.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.250
- If that thing can find
Monroe, it can sure as hell

09:11.333 --> 09:13.291
find any one of us and you
better pray

09:13.375 --> 09:15.291
it's working alone otherwise we
are all

09:15.375 --> 09:16.834
in for a world of hurt.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.542
Now, there is one more thing.

09:23.041 --> 09:26.834
I want you to go see Dr. Glenka
at the Leeland Institute.

09:28.458 --> 09:29.291
- A psych test.

09:29.375 --> 09:30.250
- Yeah.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.458
Well I gotta know if
my dog can still hunt.

09:32.542 --> 09:35.166
You're no good to me otherwise.

09:42.583 --> 09:46.750
(explosion whooshing and
booming)

09:49.834 --> 09:50.875
-  Let us move past
the war.

09:52.583 --> 09:53.625
(cells crunching)

09:53.709 --> 09:55.417
(air whooshing)

09:55.500 --> 09:56.417
(wind whistling)

09:56.500 --> 09:58.750
(waves rustling)

09:58.834 --> 10:00.250
(air whooshing)

10:00.333 --> 10:01.333
We are going to need to
start the sequence again

10:01.417 --> 10:04.500
if you don't focus.

10:04.583 --> 10:05.750
Please concentrate.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.083
-  Give me a second.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.166
-  Your childhood
again?

10:15.250 --> 10:16.917
-  Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.166
-  Was this a good
day?

10:19.250 --> 10:20.917
(birds chirping)

10:21.000 --> 10:21.750
-  It was a day.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.875
-  How are you
feeling in that moment?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.500
-  Safe, maybe.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.625
(air whooshing)

10:30.709 --> 10:31.583
Protected.

10:34.125 --> 10:38.083
-  Come on,
stay with the machine.

10:41.250 --> 10:46.208
(clock ticking)

10:46.291 --> 10:49.792
You were born into a military
family, no?

10:49.875 --> 10:51.625
-  You already know this.

10:54.709 --> 10:56.625
-  Why are
you going back to her?

10:56.709 --> 10:57.709
Focus.

10:57.792 --> 10:58.542
(screeching)

10:58.625 --> 10:59.542
-  I'm tired of this.

10:59.625 --> 11:02.709
(alien cocoon crackling)
- We are almost done.

11:02.792 --> 11:03.542
-  We're done.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.500
(light whooshing)

11:15.000 --> 11:15.041
Well?

11:16.250 --> 11:18.458
- Solid nerves.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.875
- No rust?

11:21.417 --> 11:23.709
- Not exactly.

11:23.792 --> 11:24.417
- Your motivation rate is lower

11:24.500 --> 11:25.750
than in your previous tests.

11:25.834 --> 11:29.250
- (sighs) Well, it has been
eight years

11:29.333 --> 11:31.417
since my last test.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.291
So what does that mean?

11:39.834 --> 11:42.792
- Your mind kept wandering
and that bothers me.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.917
- Uh huh.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.542
- Considering the nature of your
visit

11:47.625 --> 11:48.959
it could be....

11:50.959 --> 11:51.000
- What?

11:53.709 --> 11:54.583
- Unhealthy.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.542
Today is your birthday.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.542
You haven't put in to leave?

12:04.625 --> 12:05.500
- Nope.

12:06.709 --> 12:08.709
- You're going to be over the
age limit.

12:10.083 --> 12:13.667
- Look, (sighs) I could
make an infinite list

12:13.750 --> 12:17.083
of complaints about living in
this city,

12:18.458 --> 12:21.125
on this planet too but I'd
still much rather be here

12:21.208 --> 12:22.000
than up there.

12:24.458 --> 12:26.291
- Are you so sure about that?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.208
- Why didn't you go?

12:49.875 --> 12:52.208
- My husband was too weak for
the trip.

12:52.291 --> 12:52.917
He's a virus survivor.

12:55.458 --> 12:55.917
- But if you could?

13:02.250 --> 13:04.375
- The Moon Colony, no.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.542
My job is down here.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.333
Mr. Harrison, when this is done,

13:15.000 --> 13:15.041
whatever it is,

13:17.750 --> 13:20.125
my advice is for you to leave
the city.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.542
- I need employment profile
verification

13:39.625 --> 13:42.041
for bartenders at the Dry Dock
Bar.

13:42.959 --> 13:48.834
Employer ID registration, 198643
bravo.

13:49.458 --> 13:50.959
-  One owner, ten
employees.

13:51.041 --> 13:54.625
Three are bartenders,
no illegals reported.

13:54.709 --> 13:55.625
- How many female bartenders?

13:55.709 --> 13:57.500
-  Two.

13:57.583 --> 13:58.667
- Process.

13:58.750 --> 13:59.709
-  Based
on the crime scene report

13:59.792 --> 14:01.583
we are looking for Helen Adamov,

14:01.667 --> 14:03.750
age 28, Soviet immigrant.

14:03.834 --> 14:07.500
Address 1307 Baton Street.

14:07.583 --> 14:09.542
Employed nine months and four
days.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.583
- I need her education
and employment history,

14:11.667 --> 14:13.917
her cell records for the last 48
hours,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.041
and RFID log.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.083
Well?

14:19.166 --> 14:20.291
-  Interesting.

14:20.375 --> 14:21.709
- What?

14:21.792 --> 14:23.583
-  Classified
clearance level A12 required.

14:23.667 --> 14:26.750
No additional data available.

14:26.834 --> 14:28.250
Attempting to access.

14:29.917 --> 14:34.166
(muffled rhythmic music)
(people chattering)

14:43.208 --> 14:47.333
(dynamic rhythmic music)

14:47.417 --> 14:48.542
- Hold up, bro.

14:48.625 --> 14:54.500
Yeah, you're good.

15:10.959 --> 15:13.583
(crowd cheering and whistling)

15:13.667 --> 15:17.875
(speaking in Russian)

15:22.542 --> 15:23.834
- I'm looking for the bartender
who worked last night.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.542
(hard-driving rhythmic music)

15:25.625 --> 15:27.125
- Yelena?

15:27.208 --> 15:28.208
- Helen Adamov.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.417
- (speaking in Russian)

15:31.500 --> 15:32.583
-  What?

15:32.667 --> 15:35.375
(bottles clanking)

15:35.458 --> 15:37.834
- Helen, Yelena.

15:37.917 --> 15:41.125
(speaking in Russian)

15:41.208 --> 15:41.250
- Where is she?

15:42.834 --> 15:44.583
- Is she in some kind of
trouble?

15:51.667 --> 15:53.917
In dressing room four.

16:09.834 --> 16:13.792
(hangers clattering)

16:17.000 --> 16:20.208
- I'd like to have a word with
you.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.458
- That's more than a word,
genius.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.917
- I'm looking for someone.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.291
He knows a friend of mine.

16:29.291 --> 16:29.333
- Go on.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.458
- He was here last night.

16:35.458 --> 16:36.417
Big Russian guy.

16:38.166 --> 16:42.500
- Hmm, I know a lot of big
Russian guys.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.291
- Well, how many were here last
night?

16:48.500 --> 16:49.709
- None that I remember.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.875
(door creaking)

17:03.166 --> 17:05.959
I think it's time for you to go.

17:07.165 --> 17:11.666
Unless you can think of
another reason to stick around.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.375
Hmm, pretty.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.250
Goodbye, mister--

17:23.333 --> 17:23.375
- Harrison.

17:29.917 --> 17:31.375
- Your name's Helen Adamov.

17:32.417 --> 17:36.125
Born to Russian immigrant
parents Yuri and Kira Kosov.

17:36.208 --> 17:39.417
Both killed in a train
wreck outside Boston.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.834
Your father's sister,
Dasha Adamov, raised you.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.792
She was Assistant to the
Minister

17:44.875 --> 17:46.875
of Socialist American Affairs.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.542
At age fifteen you were enrolled

17:49.625 --> 17:50.709
in the Military Intelligence
Academy,

17:50.792 --> 17:53.083
and excelled academically.

17:53.834 --> 17:55.333
Eight years later, you were part

17:55.417 --> 17:58.000
of the Moon Colony's Project
Horizon Two.

17:59.041 --> 18:02.792
Then, nine months ago,
you became a bartender

18:02.875 --> 18:06.000
in a dive in the East Sector.

18:07.834 --> 18:09.166
Should I keep going?

18:09.250 --> 18:11.500
- If you know me the way you
claim,

18:11.583 --> 18:14.125
then you know it's best to leave
me alone.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.667
- October 7th, you left the city

18:17.750 --> 18:19.709
for two weeks, just disappeared.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.792
There's no record of your
transport pass

18:22.875 --> 18:24.333
or RFID being scanned anywhere.

18:26.542 --> 18:27.333
How is that possible?

18:30.542 --> 18:33.709
You know what happened here
last night so one more time,

18:33.792 --> 18:35.500
where is this man?

18:35.583 --> 18:36.083
(grunting)

18:36.166 --> 18:38.333
I need to find him.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.667
- Who are you?

18:39.750 --> 18:42.000
- I'm the guy that's gonna
find the Dropa flesh bag

18:42.083 --> 18:42.959
that killed my friend.

18:43.041 --> 18:45.625
- (laughs) The Dropas are dead

18:45.709 --> 18:48.208
just like your friend.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.333
- It's a simple question.

18:51.417 --> 18:54.041
- (chuckles) Things aren't
always what they seem.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.208
(kick thudding)
(Harry grunting)

18:56.291 --> 18:57.542
I need to find him.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.208
Who are you?

18:59.291 --> 19:00.500
-  I'm
the guy

19:00.583 --> 19:01.875
that's gonna find the Dropa
flesh bag

19:01.959 --> 19:03.166
that killed my friend.

19:03.250 --> 19:04.917
(chuckles) The Dropas are dead

19:05.000 --> 19:08.041
just like your friend.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.375
It's a simple question.

19:11.458 --> 19:11.875
Things aren't always

19:11.959 --> 19:13.750
what they seem.

19:13.834 --> 19:16.166
(kick clattering)
(Harry grunting)

19:16.250 --> 19:19.250
(glass shattering)

19:23.625 --> 19:27.333
Did your research happen to
mention that I've had four years

19:27.417 --> 19:28.709
of combat training?

19:31.667 --> 19:32.458
- Eleven years of real combat.

19:36.250 --> 19:38.834
I've killed for a lot less
reason.

19:42.250 --> 19:45.542
- This is bigger than us, Mr.
Harrison.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.083
(sighs) Your friend was
a part of The Legion

19:59.166 --> 20:01.500
and my guess is, you were too.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.208
Murders stack up down here
and no one investigates

20:05.291 --> 20:08.083
unless it was someone that
mattered.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.083
How could any of you expect to
walk away

20:10.166 --> 20:11.041
from what you did?

20:11.125 --> 20:13.125
- Their cocoons carried the
virus spores

20:13.208 --> 20:14.208
that nearly wiped us out.

20:14.291 --> 20:17.458
The only thing that stopped
them was The Legion.

20:17.542 --> 20:18.875
- Mr. Harrison, do you know what
it's like

20:18.959 --> 20:21.959
to lose everything, your
home, the people you love?

20:22.041 --> 20:25.583
- I don't care about your moral
cause.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.458
Where is it?

20:28.542 --> 20:29.166
- I don't know.

20:29.250 --> 20:32.041
- This is not a negotiation.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.917
If you can't help me,
I have other options.

20:34.000 --> 20:34.875
You don't.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.583
- He has a room at the Grand
Hotel in the Lower Quarter.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.041
- I know the place.

20:43.125 --> 20:48.083
- Room 832, name's Mikhail,
no last name, just Mikhail.

20:49.083 --> 20:49.417
- Why did you go there?

20:51.291 --> 20:53.000
- He asked me to contact Mr.
Monroe

20:53.083 --> 20:54.375
to leave him a message.

20:54.458 --> 20:54.500
- What message?

20:56.250 --> 20:56.959
- A note with a number.

20:57.041 --> 20:58.500
I left it at his apartment.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.792
-  What did the note say?

21:01.875 --> 21:03.792
- There's a traitor in The
Legion.

21:04.750 --> 21:05.667
- A traitor?

21:06.834 --> 21:08.500
More!

21:08.583 --> 21:10.291
- That's it I swear.

21:18.250 --> 21:22.041
My father fought for the Dropa's
rights

21:22.125 --> 21:24.959
when they came here.

21:25.041 --> 21:27.333
Then The Party killed him for
it.

21:27.417 --> 21:27.458
My mother too.

21:30.542 --> 21:32.166
He would tell me that
people were so afraid

21:32.250 --> 21:33.250
that the world was going to end

21:33.333 --> 21:35.625
that they were actually
hoping that it would.

21:36.458 --> 21:41.041
You know, it's easier to
give up, to live in fear.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.166
That's what those in control
want you

21:42.250 --> 21:47.375
to feel, powerless,
insignificant.

21:48.625 --> 21:52.583
But the Dropas came here
and they made us realize

21:52.667 --> 21:55.417
that there's more out
there in the universe.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.750
They gave us hope.

22:05.125 --> 22:05.625
What do you believe in?

22:07.625 --> 22:10.542
- If the hotel doesn't
check out I'm coming back.

22:10.625 --> 22:14.333
And trust me, you don't
want me to come back.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.000
- You won't be back.

22:16.083 --> 22:19.542
Mikhail just may find you
first if he hasn't already.

22:19.625 --> 22:21.417
-  That would
make my job easier.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.792
- Was it easy before?

22:49.166 --> 22:52.875
(footsteps on the fire escape)

22:59.375 --> 23:03.959
- (distant muffled argument)

23:11.542 --> 23:13.375
(police siren beeping)

23:13.458 --> 23:18.917
(speaking in Russian over
loudspeaker)

23:42.792 --> 23:45.709
(street vendors chatter)

23:59.500 --> 24:01.458
-  Welcome home,
Harry.

24:03.291 --> 24:06.834
Daily status, one missed VidFon
call,

24:06.917 --> 24:09.542
eleven unread email
transmissions.

24:09.625 --> 24:12.375
Fusion energy bill, 19 days past
due.

24:13.417 --> 24:16.000
-  Enough already,
C.O.N.T.A.G.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.625
Can I just have a few minutes?

24:19.667 --> 24:19.709
Alone?

24:23.041 --> 24:25.625
-  Harry, I
have something else to say.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.166
- What?

24:29.959 --> 24:31.792
- Happy Birthday.

(helicopters whirring above)

26:00.959 --> 26:02.750
(people talking)

26:20.458 --> 26:22.125
- Estimated time of death?

26:22.208 --> 26:23.667
- Sometime between 10 and 12.

26:27.083 --> 26:28.333
-  DNA sweep?

26:28.417 --> 26:29.709
- Clean.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.041
-  Clean?

26:31.125 --> 26:34.125
- Nothing, only established
samples.

26:34.208 --> 26:36.000
We're scanning the staff and
patrons again

26:36.083 --> 26:38.166
to make sure we didn't overlook
anything.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.250
- Professional.

26:43.834 --> 26:46.208
-  Does this
remind you of something?

27:03.667 --> 27:04.917
- Inspector Carter.

27:09.083 --> 27:12.583
(police radio chatter)

28:21.709 --> 28:26.458
(Kate breathing heavy)

28:26.542 --> 28:29.709
(soft moan)

29:07.166 --> 29:09.083
(alien roar)

29:09.166 --> 29:12.000
(Harrison panting)

29:30.333 --> 29:32.917
trolley whirring

29:41.000 --> 29:43.875
(muffled talking)

29:47.375 --> 29:49.583
- You wanna tell me what
happened last night?

29:51.250 --> 29:53.917
The woman you questioned
last night is dead.

29:56.250 --> 29:57.875
(Harrison sighs)

29:57.959 --> 29:59.041
Her eye sockets were crushed in.

30:01.166 --> 30:04.250
I've seen a few Dropas you
finished off look the same way.

30:05.625 --> 30:07.291
- She was breathing when I left.

30:10.625 --> 30:13.458
- Can you explain this?

30:21.959 --> 30:24.625
(Harrison sighs)

30:24.709 --> 30:25.583
Well?

30:29.291 --> 30:31.250
- She must have removed it
when I was questioning her.

30:31.333 --> 30:32.959
- And?

30:35.041 --> 30:39.000
- She was trying to
manipulate the situation.

30:39.083 --> 30:42.500
She was very, persuasive.

30:44.667 --> 30:46.583
- I've got eyewitnesses
that put you at the Dry Dock

30:46.667 --> 30:49.458
at the same time as the murder.

30:55.125 --> 30:55.917
- What are you implying?

30:56.000 --> 30:56.917
- Implying?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.959
Nothing, except that I
just covered your ass.

31:03.792 --> 31:05.208
Taft can't end up with a trail
of bodies

31:05.291 --> 31:06.709
leading back to this Dropa.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.166
- Yeah, that wouldn't
look good, now would it?

31:10.375 --> 31:11.583
- We're on our own out here.

31:11.667 --> 31:15.000
It's about survival now, ours!

31:16.333 --> 31:17.000
We let these Dropas walk away.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.583
Now they're back to finish us.

31:19.667 --> 31:20.875
- Can you blame 'em?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.250
- I've done some pretty
bad things, Harrison,

31:31.208 --> 31:32.959
things that I can't take back.

31:33.041 --> 31:36.500
- You did them to protect the
cause

31:36.583 --> 31:37.917
like all of us.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.500
- That's The Party's line.

31:39.583 --> 31:41.792
We did it because we had no
other choice.

31:41.875 --> 31:44.291
You do what you're ordered to do

31:44.375 --> 31:45.917
and don't ask questions.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.041
- You chose the lesser of two
evils.

31:49.792 --> 31:51.500
Just learn to live with it.

31:51.583 --> 31:52.458
I did.

31:54.417 --> 31:55.208
- You're no saint in all of
this.

31:57.458 --> 32:00.667
- I know.

32:06.583 --> 32:09.417
(sighs)

32:18.166 --> 32:20.875
(horns honking)

32:23.125 --> 32:25.709
(bus rumbling)

32:31.917 --> 32:33.500
-  Warning, two
rounds

32:33.583 --> 32:35.583
of plasma ammunition loaded.

32:35.667 --> 32:39.250
Restricted use due to potential
thermal burns to civilians.

32:39.333 --> 32:42.125
(trolley whirring)

32:51.083 --> 32:53.291
(turntable music in a foreign
language)

32:53.375 --> 32:56.250
(door bell buzzing)

33:02.834 --> 33:07.875
- (Jin speaking in Mandarin)
Coming, I'm coming.

33:11.625 --> 33:12.667
(door thudding)

33:12.750 --> 33:14.959
What do you want?

33:15.041 --> 33:17.250
-  (grunting)
Come on, Jin, play nice.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.000
- I'm play nice up your fucking
asshole!

33:19.083 --> 33:19.792
You wrecked my place pretty bad
last time.

33:19.875 --> 33:21.709
- It was a long time ago.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.083
- Come on, get out!

33:30.500 --> 33:33.417
right to barge in huh?

33:33.500 --> 33:34.667
Just like that?

33:34.750 --> 33:36.333
Geez.

33:36.417 --> 33:39.417
You have no respect for
other people's property.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.417
- You're my eyes down here, Jin.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.166
(Jin chuckles)

33:42.250 --> 33:42.333
You always have been.

33:47.709 --> 33:48.959
The Legion needs your help.

33:49.041 --> 33:50.208
- The Legion no more.

33:50.291 --> 33:51.208
(laughing)

33:51.291 --> 33:52.458
Those days are gone.

33:52.542 --> 33:57.500
Uh, I don't owe Legion
for nothing, no more.

33:58.291 --> 34:00.083
- Well, consider it a favor
then.

34:00.166 --> 34:03.250
- No, your kind of favor,
bad news, bad news.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.709
- I'm looking for the tenant in
room 832.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.000
- Don't know nothing.

34:07.917 --> 34:09.250
What number?

34:09.333 --> 34:10.041
-  832.

34:10.125 --> 34:12.667
- Ah, nobody lives there.

34:13.667 --> 34:16.792
(coughing)

34:24.458 --> 34:25.792
(breathes deeply)

34:25.875 --> 34:27.875
- Catch your breath.

34:27.958 --> 34:29.250
I just need a minute of your
time.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.250
- No, no minute for you.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.000
- Make time.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.583
(Jin labored breathing)

34:59.792 --> 35:02.834
(Jin laughing)

35:02.917 --> 35:06.083
- Ah, now I remember.

35:06.166 --> 35:12.083
A big man, a big man, name
Mikhail.

35:12.417 --> 35:14.500
(Jin breathing heavy)

35:14.583 --> 35:15.917
What do you want with him?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.417
- It's personal.

35:17.500 --> 35:17.542
Gimme the key.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.625
- Huh, personal, everything's
personal with you,

35:21.709 --> 35:22.750
means big trouble.

35:22.834 --> 35:24.750
- The key Jin.

35:25.875 --> 35:29.917
- Are you gonna bust
up my place again, huh?

35:30.000 --> 35:34.375
Listen, he's a good tenant,
model tenant.

35:34.458 --> 35:35.583
Always pays the rent.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.000
- Your model tenant is a Dropa.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.917
- What?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.458
- And I'm taking him out of
here with or without the key.

35:42.542 --> 35:43.709
You understand?

35:45.750 --> 35:48.458
(door creaking)

36:22.959 --> 36:25.667
(distant city traffic)

36:37.208 --> 36:39.917
(door creaking)

37:04.959 --> 37:08.542
(water dripping)

38:15.208 --> 38:21.125
(box clattering)

38:29.959 --> 38:32.625
(hand thudding)

38:41.250 --> 38:42.583
(mechanical whirring)

38:53.458 --> 38:54.834
(grunting)

38:55.917 --> 38:59.917
- I believe you have something
that does not belong to you.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.417
- Come and get it.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.458
(gun firing)

39:05.834 --> 39:07.458
(horn honking)

39:11.500 --> 39:13.834
(gun firing)

39:27.125 --> 39:29.375
(panting)

39:59.667 --> 40:02.458
(Hummer rumbling)

40:07.333 --> 40:12.208
(ocean waves lapping on shore)

40:39.083 --> 40:44.959
(train rumbling)

40:55.709 --> 40:57.792
(grunting)

40:58.875 --> 41:02.625
known fact can become a

41:02.709 --> 41:05.709
well known fact and part of
our job, Harry, is to make sure

41:05.792 --> 41:07.291
that don't happen.

41:08.291 --> 41:13.166
Now, how in the hell are we
gonna do that

41:13.250 --> 41:15.625
if you start trying to blow away
Dropas

41:15.709 --> 41:18.458
in front of a damn audience
in the Lower Quarter?

41:19.375 --> 41:20.250
Well?

41:21.125 --> 41:23.834
(Harry panting)

41:36.208 --> 41:38.333
- Got something for ya.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.667
Found that in the Russian's
room at the Grand Hotel.

41:45.834 --> 41:48.083
- Now, why in the hell are you
showing me

41:48.166 --> 41:49.875
half a damn cockroach?

41:52.333 --> 41:53.667
This is cybernetic.

41:55.333 --> 41:56.709
That's pretty advanced
technology for a Dropa.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.750
Kinda like them bug bots we
used to use back in the day.

42:01.834 --> 42:04.125
- Yeah, I thought it might
be a surveillance tool

42:04.208 --> 42:06.917
or a weapon but it's not.

42:07.750 --> 42:09.458
Took me a moment to figure it
out.

42:09.542 --> 42:10.750
-  Figure what out?

42:11.667 --> 42:12.625
- It's a decoy,

42:14.166 --> 42:16.417
an elaborate decoy, but decoy
nonetheless.

42:16.500 --> 42:18.125
- I'm not following this.

42:19.458 --> 42:21.750
- The Dropas have a
different magnetic makeup

42:21.834 --> 42:22.917
than anything else on this
planet.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.667
The magnetic field around
them throws the compass cells

42:26.750 --> 42:27.875
in roaches crazy.

42:27.959 --> 42:31.125
- All right, all right,
professor, please plain English.

42:31.208 --> 42:33.333
- They spin around, get lost.

42:33.417 --> 42:36.375
350 million years of
navigating gone haywire.

42:36.458 --> 42:38.834
Monroe knew this.

42:38.917 --> 42:39.792
He tracked with bugs.

42:42.125 --> 42:44.000
- Okay, so why cybernetic?

42:45.458 --> 42:47.959
- Somehow this Dropa figured
this out

42:48.041 --> 42:48.667
and knew Monroe's methods.

42:50.834 --> 42:52.917
He found a way to throw
him off long enough

42:53.000 --> 42:54.792
to let his guard down.

42:54.875 --> 42:59.125
- So, this Dropa is hunting us?

43:00.375 --> 43:01.792
- Monroe anyway.

43:02.375 --> 43:04.667
And maybe all of us.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.959
There's one other thing.

43:09.041 --> 43:10.917
(sniffles)

43:11.000 --> 43:16.542
The Adamov girl said something
odd to me last night.

43:17.834 --> 43:21.291
She said the Russian had
a message for Monroe.

43:21.375 --> 43:22.250
- Yeah?

43:23.917 --> 43:26.166
- Said there was a
traitor among The Legion.

43:27.583 --> 43:29.458
Any idea what it's talking
about?

43:31.333 --> 43:32.333
- Look, why don't you go home,

43:32.417 --> 43:35.792
get some rest, take some
aspirin.

43:36.709 --> 43:38.583
Hell, take a whole lotta
aspirin.

43:39.333 --> 43:41.834
This Dropa knows we're onto it.

43:52.375 --> 43:56.709
(train whistle blaring)

44:02.375 --> 44:06.709
(distant siren blaring)

44:12.250 --> 44:15.166
(grunts)

44:17.125 --> 44:20.166
-  Give up that easily?

44:21.166 --> 44:23.750
You've become... soft in your
retirement.

44:27.083 --> 44:29.125
(thud)

44:35.500 --> 44:36.000
- What are you doing here?

44:38.625 --> 44:40.291
It's been five years, Madison.

44:42.500 --> 44:46.125
- I came back because someone
killed a member of our team.

44:46.208 --> 44:48.458
Judging by the looks
of you, I'm glad I did.

44:51.000 --> 44:51.041
What happened?

44:53.000 --> 44:53.875
- Retribution.

45:15.250 --> 45:17.542
(panting)

45:24.291 --> 45:26.667
(laughing)

45:48.208 --> 45:50.959
(squelching)

45:58.250 --> 46:00.917
(bullet clacking)

46:21.458 --> 46:24.917
(flesh sizzling)

46:27.083 --> 46:29.709
(grunts)

46:29.792 --> 46:31.083
(panting)

46:35.208 --> 46:37.542
(shower water trickling)

46:37.625 --> 46:39.375
(Harrison sighs)

47:04.208 --> 47:04.917
- You look terrible.

47:21.083 --> 47:23.208
- I thought you might have left.

47:23.291 --> 47:25.333
-  Someone's
gotta keep an eye on you.

47:25.417 --> 47:27.834
- (scoffs) I'm fine.

47:30.834 --> 47:33.417
-  What's the next
move?

47:33.500 --> 47:38.291
- (sighs) Heading out to
the country in the morning.

47:38.375 --> 47:39.625
-  What's out there?

47:39.709 --> 47:43.083
- (sighs) Hopefully answers.

47:43.166 --> 47:45.250
(sniffles)

47:45.333 --> 47:46.208
Wanna come along?

47:46.834 --> 47:48.917
You could stay the night.

47:50.458 --> 47:52.166
No strings.

47:53.875 --> 47:55.291
- There never were with you.

47:59.458 --> 48:03.291
- So tell me what you've been
up to the last five years.

48:03.375 --> 48:04.125
- I'm gonna go.

48:04.208 --> 48:05.041
- Look, I...

48:07.375 --> 48:08.208
I just wanna talk.

48:10.083 --> 48:11.917
I could really use that right
now.

48:15.667 --> 48:18.542
- You better dry off first.

48:34.500 --> 48:38.041
(birds chirping)

48:43.166 --> 48:43.208
- Eva?

48:47.250 --> 48:49.417
(sighs)

48:49.500 --> 48:52.250
I wonder where she could be?

49:01.208 --> 49:04.834
Oh, I must have spent too
long at the shipyards.

49:07.542 --> 49:10.250
My beautiful little
girl must have grown up

49:11.583 --> 49:12.041
and moved away.

49:20.750 --> 49:22.667
What am I going to do?

49:24.500 --> 49:26.291
(grunts)

49:26.375 --> 49:28.291
(chuckles)

49:28.375 --> 49:31.083
If only she had come to say
goodbye.

49:33.458 --> 49:36.000
(Eva giggling)

49:38.792 --> 49:40.709
I miss her so much.

49:48.625 --> 49:50.333
Oh! (laughs)

49:51.667 --> 49:52.333
Muah!

49:52.417 --> 49:54.375
You are hiding the whole time.

49:54.458 --> 49:55.875
I knew it.

49:55.959 --> 49:57.667
(laughs)

50:20.375 --> 50:22.709
(Harrison sighing)

50:31.500 --> 50:33.208
- So what happened?

50:36.208 --> 50:41.208
- (sighs) Well, after The Party

50:41.291 --> 50:45.792
disbanded The Legion, what else
was there?

50:46.792 --> 50:49.291
You know we were nothing more
than an embarrassing secret

50:49.375 --> 50:51.458
that just needed to go away.

50:53.542 --> 50:58.375
(chuckles) Taft, Carter, Monroe
stayed.

50:59.291 --> 51:02.959
I was out, moving on and you
were a wreck.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.083
Guess if I was living in
your skin at the same time

51:08.166 --> 51:09.500
I'd be the same way.

51:09.583 --> 51:11.333
(Harrison sighs)

51:19.000 --> 51:21.750
Arthur took off to the colony.

51:23.041 --> 51:26.083
It was his time and he wanted
to leave everything behind.

51:30.083 --> 51:32.083
- So what happened to Jackson
out there?

51:34.583 --> 51:38.166
- I guess she just
couldn't handle it anymore.

51:42.417 --> 51:44.041
I don't know.

51:44.041 --> 51:46.542
She was on cleanup with me.

51:49.792 --> 51:53.875
It was either us or them
with the Dropa Resistance.

51:53.959 --> 51:56.875
(explosion whooshing)

51:56.959 --> 52:00.375
We understood that but the
families,

52:02.083 --> 52:03.250
that was different.

52:06.291 --> 52:08.417
A few months later
Monroe brought in Jackson

52:08.500 --> 52:12.166
to head up the final sweep
of the containment camps.

52:14.333 --> 52:18.333
The Party wanted it
finished fast and clean.

52:22.125 --> 52:26.667
They poisoned the Dropa water
supply with a DDT derivative.

52:32.291 --> 52:34.000
It only killed the children.

53:19.333 --> 53:21.375
(Mikhail screaming)

53:21.458 --> 53:22.333
(alien roaring)

53:25.166 --> 53:27.834
(fist thudding)

53:29.333 --> 53:29.417
Two months later

53:32.333 --> 53:34.291
I found her dead in a motel room

53:34.375 --> 53:37.417
outside of Waco, gun still in
her mouth.

53:41.375 --> 53:43.750
- Jackson may have been the only
one of us

53:43.834 --> 53:45.041
with a conscience.

53:47.458 --> 53:47.500
- Yeah.

53:49.542 --> 53:51.250
And look where that got her.

53:56.375 --> 53:58.959
(Harry sighs deeply)

53:59.041 --> 54:00.250
Still not over her?

54:02.875 --> 54:05.000
Out of all of us you had
the most reason to hate 'em

54:05.083 --> 54:07.291
after what she did.

54:07.375 --> 54:08.417
- That's enough.

54:08.500 --> 54:09.166
- She betrayed you.

54:09.250 --> 54:11.291
- I said that's enough.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.667
(Madison sighs)

54:14.750 --> 54:16.041
Kate's in the past.

54:18.250 --> 54:18.917
- Do you really wanna
know what I've been doing

54:19.000 --> 54:20.458
for the past five years?

54:24.208 --> 54:25.458
Trying to find reasons to stay
away.

54:27.208 --> 54:30.291
I never lost faith in you,
Harry.

54:32.959 --> 54:35.125
- Faith is for the weak.

55:04.208 --> 55:06.000
-  Thank you,
mister--

55:06.083 --> 55:08.375
-  Monroe.

55:08.458 --> 55:10.125
-  Monroe.

55:12.333 --> 55:15.166
(birds chirping)

55:45.250 --> 55:51.166
(military snare drumming)

56:23.083 --> 56:26.333
-  Come back to me.

56:26.417 --> 56:27.709
(panting)

56:30.959 --> 56:33.375
(grunting)

56:43.041 --> 56:44.709
(seagulls squawking)

56:44.792 --> 56:47.208
-  Over seven million
hits on the CityCam network.

56:47.291 --> 56:49.750
I thought you said it was
cleared.

56:49.834 --> 56:52.000
-  We cut the
feed as quick as we could.

56:52.083 --> 56:54.500
I told you not to get Harrison
involved.

56:54.583 --> 56:56.208
He's dangerous.

56:56.291 --> 56:58.875
- There's no one better for this
job.

56:58.959 --> 57:02.834
- Maybe, but he changed
since the accident.

57:04.250 --> 57:07.125
I'm not sure where his
loyalties lie anymore.

57:07.208 --> 57:08.792
-  Listen, Harry moves
fast.

57:08.875 --> 57:10.667
He'll find this Dropa.

57:10.750 --> 57:11.166
-  He's unpredictable.

57:11.250 --> 57:14.709
(engine revving)

57:59.000 --> 58:01.709
(waves rustling)

58:08.792 --> 58:11.375
-  You're not alone.

58:11.458 --> 58:13.583
Death is not the end.

58:16.875 --> 58:18.375
Death is just another road,

58:19.041 --> 58:21.291
the road in life.

58:22.375 --> 58:26.667
And your soul is the guide.

58:51.375 --> 58:54.750
This is not over, Monroe.

59:00.083 --> 59:03.000
(engine rumbling)

59:10.875 --> 59:12.750
(insects buzzing)

59:41.709 --> 59:44.500
(light knocking)

59:50.083 --> 59:51.792
(door creaking)

59:55.375 --> 59:56.250
- Arthur?

01:00:05.709 --> 01:00:08.375
(pot boiling)

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:13.875
(door creaking)

01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:36.917
(truck rumbling)

01:00:50.291 --> 01:00:53.500
(lid clanking)

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:56.291
(Harrison sighing)

01:01:16.208 --> 01:01:17.917
(door thudding)

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.875
(spoons clattering)

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.625
- Want some?

01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:42.208
(lid clanking)

01:01:50.834 --> 01:01:53.667
(Arthur sipping)

01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:59.000
(city traffic)

01:02:02.333 --> 01:02:05.000
(pedestrian chatter)

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:19.458
- What made you come back?

01:02:21.917 --> 01:02:26.250
- It's quieter here, less
distractions, you know.

01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:30.625
- I don't know about that
Arthur.

01:02:30.709 --> 01:02:32.750
You wanted outta here pretty bad

01:02:32.834 --> 01:02:34.417
after your time in The Legion.

01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:36.000
- That's what I thought, too.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:38.917
But it's worse up there.

01:02:40.792 --> 01:02:43.834
You know they're considering
complete isolationism.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.083
No, the Colony's no place
for someone like me.

01:02:53.625 --> 01:02:55.375
- Seems kinda isolated here.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:58.458
- It's simpler.

01:03:00.625 --> 01:03:03.125
- Yeah, I can see that.

01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:12.667
- So, I take it this isn't a
social visit.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:15.333
- No.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:18.125
-  Good.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.333
Let's keep it that way.

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:22.500
Business then?

01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:26.542
- Dropa hunt.

01:03:31.959 --> 01:03:34.709
(horn honking)

01:03:34.792 --> 01:03:37.000
(footsteps clacking)

01:03:51.959 --> 01:03:54.458
-  Who dragged you into
this?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.917
-  Taft.

01:03:58.667 --> 01:04:00.959
-  You just can't
say no to that sumbitch.

01:04:02.959 --> 01:04:04.417
-  It could've
been any of us in that bar

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.750
couple of nights ago.

01:04:06.417 --> 01:04:08.083
- But it wasn't.

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:12.667
-  Yeah, maybe so,
but that doesn't change things.

01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:17.208
- Your loyalty's gonna
put you in a body bag.

01:04:20.166 --> 01:04:22.625
(Harrison sighs)

01:04:25.166 --> 01:04:26.166
- This Dropa is not like the
others.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.333
They're usually runners not
killers.

01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:36.333
- We knew this was gonna come
back on us.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.291
We should've finished 'em
off when we had the chance.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.917
-  There were other
options for dealing with them

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.917
but The Party chose the easiest
way out.

01:04:45.959 --> 01:04:48.083
-  There's a lot
you still don't know.

01:04:49.792 --> 01:04:52.041
- Maybe it's time you told me.

01:04:54.583 --> 01:04:56.542
- Let's go out back.

01:05:24.959 --> 01:05:26.792
(Taft sighs)

01:05:26.875 --> 01:05:30.166
- Why did it come after you?

01:05:48.291 --> 01:05:49.667
(scoffs)

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.875
We really did it, didn't we
Monroe?

01:05:52.959 --> 01:05:56.041
We took it all back from
those greedy bastards.

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:02.250
Everybody thought we were heroes
then.

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:40.625
(chair clattering)

01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:43.333
(Arthur sighs)

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.500
- Back in 2004 we found a stone
disc

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:52.166
washed ashore near Rockport
along with several cocoons.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.542
The discs told the story of
the Dropas in hieroglyphics.

01:06:58.625 --> 01:07:00.041
And then there was this one.

01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:03.792
You see any pattern in all that?

01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:06.375
- Not really.

01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:09.959
- There are recognizable forms.

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.458
- Recognizable?

01:07:12.542 --> 01:07:13.458
- Symbolic.

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:16.125
Very stylized.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:23.417
This first one, the oval, is a
cocoon.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.333
And this?

01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:35.041
- I suppose it's... first
phase Dropa metamorphosis?

01:07:35.291 --> 01:07:35.333
- Yes.

01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:38.917
And next a human form.

01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:42.792
And then this.

01:07:47.041 --> 01:07:48.458
- What's that?

01:07:49.083 --> 01:07:51.250
- It's what your hunting.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.500
(tentacles slurping)

01:08:17.582 --> 01:08:22.457
(keyboard clacking)

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:27.542
- Who else knew?

01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:34.792
- Other than the need-to-know
personnel in The Party

01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:37.041
only Taft, Carter, and me.

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:41.582
I suspect Monroe would've
found out sometime later.

01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:44.375
It was tight-lipped.

01:08:44.457 --> 01:08:48.917
You have no idea how
much worldwide hysteria

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.082
it would've caused.

01:08:53.125 --> 01:08:55.291
Even more than the virus.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:59.417
- What do you mean even
more than the virus?

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:02.582
- It was all a cover Harry.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.166
The virus was spread
through the atmosphere

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.000
in small, controlled amounts,

01:09:14.457 --> 01:09:16.917
in geographically specific
locations.

01:09:18.834 --> 01:09:21.125
The same pattern as the Dropa
migration.

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:25.166
The virus was nothing
more than a mutated strain

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:26.417
of a viral hemorrhagic fever.

01:09:28.959 --> 01:09:31.000
There was nothing alien about
it.

01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:32.750
We manufactured the bug to
create

01:09:32.834 --> 01:09:33.917
just enough fear to--

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.125
- Just enough fear?

01:09:37.291 --> 01:09:39.792
I knew people who died from that
virus.

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:41.917
- We all did.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.291
Calculated risk unfortunately.

01:09:45.959 --> 01:09:46.875
If one of those things got out--

01:09:46.959 --> 01:09:50.041
- It would've killed
over 20 million people

01:09:50.125 --> 01:09:51.375
like the virus?

01:09:51.457 --> 01:09:52.457
That's controllable, measurable?

01:09:54.667 --> 01:09:57.125
Who decides who lives and who
dies?

01:09:57.208 --> 01:09:58.291
- The Dropas were a potential
threat.

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:02.583
We just had to disguise the
reason why

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:06.500
and use it to create
unity, unity in The Party.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.917
- We committed genocide.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.875
- No.

01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:14.709
Genocide is for humans.

01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:19.458
I preferred... extinction.

01:10:20.834 --> 01:10:24.375
It was them or us.

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:27.291
Now, I don't know about
you but I prefer to be

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.125
on the us side of the equation.

01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:31.417
- I was referring to humans.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.542
- We're just pawns.

01:10:35.959 --> 01:10:39.208
It's always been that way.

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:41.375
You've been around long
enough to know that.

01:10:44.125 --> 01:10:45.709
- It's time things changed.

01:10:46.667 --> 01:10:48.083
(punch thudding)
(Arthur grunting)

01:10:48.166 --> 01:10:52.000
(Taft grunting)

01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:53.333
(gun clattering)

01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:55.917
(Taft breathing heavy)

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.250
- It's not so easy when
the prey fights back,

01:10:58.333 --> 01:10:59.667
is it old man?

01:11:00.959 --> 01:11:04.959
(punches thudding)

01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:05.458
- How's that for easy?

01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:08.333
(Harry panting)

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:16.333
- What are you doing?

01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:17.750
- Why did you come back?

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.667
(punches thudding)

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.542
(Harry grunting)

01:11:26.083 --> 01:11:28.542
Or maybe you didn't.

01:11:29.875 --> 01:11:32.583
(wall rattling)

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.542
(gun firing)

01:11:47.542 --> 01:11:48.959
(punches thudding)

01:11:49.041 --> 01:11:50.709
(Taft shouting)

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.041
(bone cracking)

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.583
(Taft panting)

01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:07.208
(tentacles crunching)

01:12:12.959 --> 01:12:16.250
(tentacle thudding)

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.500
(machine clacking)

01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:20.500
(machine beeping)

01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:33.750
- Wakey, wakey.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.917
- (speaking with mechanical
voice) Oh no.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.041
- Oh yes.

01:12:40.792 --> 01:12:43.500
- Well, this is embarrassing.

01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:47.250
- Where's Arthur?

01:12:47.333 --> 01:12:48.667
- It's still me, Harry.

01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:52.500
It's just a synth body, an
android.

01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:55.750
We're bio-linked.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:12:59.875
I wasn't safe down there.

01:13:01.125 --> 01:13:03.542
I'm better off in the Colony,
least for the time being.

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:07.834
I hope you understand.

01:13:10.208 --> 01:13:12.583
- I don't know what to believe.

01:13:14.125 --> 01:13:15.917
(chair clattering)

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.458
- You still don't realize what
we were dealing with here.

01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:23.000
The longer it's out there, the
less chance

01:13:23.083 --> 01:13:23.583
you'll be able to stop it.

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:26.125
- How am I supposed to kill
something

01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:28.583
that constantly evolves?

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:31.583
- Taft picked you for a reason.

01:13:33.875 --> 01:13:37.041
You understand the Dropas.

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:40.834
- If that's an off-handed
reference to Kate

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:41.500
then leave her out of this.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:44.750
- Oh, I didn't mean it like
that.

01:13:47.208 --> 01:13:49.166
No one blames you.

01:13:50.917 --> 01:13:52.250
She fooled all of us.

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:55.667
I've never seen a Dropa

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:59.333
with such complete
human genetic synthesis.

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:03.834
Kate was unique.

01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:07.375
She had a great ass too.

01:14:08.834 --> 01:14:10.417
(gun clanking)

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.667
-  Don't mention her
again.

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:19.208
- A little levity is needed
here, don't you think?

01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:22.667
Helps us keep a level head.

01:14:25.625 --> 01:14:28.709
Besides, this thing is
much bigger than you or me.

01:14:32.542 --> 01:14:34.917
- The girl I questioned about
Monroe

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.375
said the exact same thing.

01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:37.583
-  Sure she did.

01:14:37.667 --> 01:14:39.542
-  What are you
telling me?

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:43.709
- (distorted voice) Yelena
Adamov.

01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:48.709
The Party had me work an
angle on her for six months.

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:51.208
She didn't know what her
real role was anyway.

01:14:51.291 --> 01:14:52.583
She just kept on fighting the
good fight.

01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:56.875
- She was a part of all this?

01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:00.375
- Wakey, wakey.

01:15:03.125 --> 01:15:05.041
- And you set up Monroe.

01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:09.375
-  A miscalculation.

01:15:10.125 --> 01:15:11.166
- Miscalculation?

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:11.792
- The Dropa was the target.

01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:16.125
Just didn't go as planned.

01:15:18.625 --> 01:15:21.583
Didn't know what we were dealing
with until it was too late.

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.792
Shame too.

01:15:26.166 --> 01:15:27.667
I always liked Monroe.

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:29.667
- Yeah, I can tell you're
all broken up about it.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.959
- More than you know.

01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:37.291
It took us six months
to set this thing up.

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:41.917
You have no idea how to
make things so covert.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.458
We had to keep quiet.

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:48.250
Even Taft was kept in the
dark about most of it.

01:15:48.333 --> 01:15:49.875
- And you played both of us.

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:53.125
-  I had no
intention of bringing you in.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.208
That was Taft.

01:15:56.917 --> 01:15:56.959
- And Yelena?

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.875
- I had to uh... quiet her.

01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:07.917
- If the Dropas presented
this much of a threat

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.834
why didn't we just finish them
off?

01:16:09.917 --> 01:16:11.625
- If it were up to me, I
would've finished

01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:12.750
what we started.

01:16:14.208 --> 01:16:17.500
But the females didn't pose a
threat.

01:16:18.375 --> 01:16:21.041
It was the two bull males.

01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:25.291
We needed their genetic codes.

01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:29.875
(distorted voice) Stepwise
Evolution.

01:16:31.542 --> 01:16:33.750
That's what the scientists
back East called it.

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:36.625
- Stepwise Evolution?

01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:37.834
-  Well, something about
adding

01:16:37.917 --> 01:16:40.500
additional Dropa amino acids
to the human genetic code.

01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:41.417
- Jesus.

01:16:43.542 --> 01:16:46.625
- Dropas have incredible
regenerative qualities.

01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:50.083
-  Where is the other
male?

01:16:50.166 --> 01:16:50.917
-  Tagged.

01:16:52.959 --> 01:16:53.291
He's dormant.

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:54.917
- Dormant?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:56.792
Was this one dormant?

01:16:56.875 --> 01:16:56.917
- Yes.

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:01.166
Until he figured out how
to remove his tracer.

01:17:03.542 --> 01:17:06.041
But the other male is not a
threat.

01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:07.000
- Yet.

01:17:08.959 --> 01:17:09.000
- Harry.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:14.458
What do you remember after the
accident?

01:17:15.959 --> 01:17:17.667
What about all those months you
spent

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:19.166
at the clinic with Kate?

01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:33.458
(chair clattering)

01:17:33.542 --> 01:17:34.083
(gun clicking)

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:35.750
- Leave Kate out of this.

01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:38.333
(gun firing)

01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:44.166
(mouse clicking)

01:18:04.959 --> 01:18:07.625
What's
that?

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:12.417
It's what you're hunting.

01:18:18.166 --> 01:18:20.083
(rain pattering)

01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:34.125
- I wish Mommy was still with
us.

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:39.041
- Oh, my solnyshko.

01:18:40.875 --> 01:18:41.875
We will be fine.

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:46.500
And I will never let
anything happen to you.

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:52.000
(grunting)

01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:54.125
(panting)

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:02.625
-  Where have you been?

01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:05.083
-  Working a lead.

01:19:05.166 --> 01:19:05.792
- Taft's dead.

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:08.709
This thing knows how to find us.

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:11.000
The coroner's report from
Monroe's attack

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:13.291
found small traces of liquid
disprosium.

01:19:13.375 --> 01:19:15.375
- Disprosium?

01:19:15.458 --> 01:19:16.458
- It's an element that was
used in fusion reactors

01:19:16.542 --> 01:19:19.000
prior to balthorium.

01:19:19.083 --> 01:19:20.875
Outdated now and rarely used.

01:19:21.875 --> 01:19:24.458
The data scan found one regional
location

01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:25.542
where it's stored.

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:27.500
It's a warehouse in the ship
channel.

01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:28.500
I'm gonna check it out.

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:29.458
-  I'll go with you.

01:19:29.542 --> 01:19:30.625
-  I'm on it.

01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:32.542
- Just wait until I get there.

01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:33.709
-  No time for that.

01:19:33.792 --> 01:19:35.166
- You don't know what you're
dealing with.

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:36.625
This could get ugly real fast.

01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:38.417
-  I know what
I'm dealing with Harrison.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.709
The question is do you?

01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:43.542
(Harrison sighs)

01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:46.417
(engine revving)

01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:07.166
- Oh.

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:08.250
(Harry panting)

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:09.208
Oh.

01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:16.792
You okay?

01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:17.709
- What's wrong?

01:20:19.959 --> 01:20:20.834
- Taft's dead.

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:23.250
I was worried.

01:20:24.792 --> 01:20:26.125
C.O.N.T.A.G. tried to locate you
on RFID.

01:20:28.083 --> 01:20:29.000
- I know how to handle myself.

01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:33.083
I removed the sensor years ago
Harry.

01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:35.709
- It's not safe here.

01:20:35.792 --> 01:20:37.542
You need to get outta the city.

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:38.291
I have to find Carter.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:39.625
She has a lead on this Dropa.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:40.667
- I'm gonna go with you.

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:41.417
- Not this time.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.667
Things are different.
- No!

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.583
You don't need to do this.

01:20:44.667 --> 01:20:46.375
Okay, just walk away.

01:20:46.458 --> 01:20:48.417
Let Carter deal with it.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:49.667
- Taft brought me into this for
a reason.

01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:53.083
- You have no loyalty to him.

01:20:53.166 --> 01:20:55.834
- He's the reason I'm still
breathing.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:59.375
- You're alive because you
didn't give up.

01:20:59.458 --> 01:21:01.083
- Not giving up didn't save me.

01:21:01.959 --> 01:21:06.125
Between Taft and Kate, I owe
them.

01:21:06.208 --> 01:21:07.917
- You owe them nothing.

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:10.709
You gave everything to The
Legion

01:21:10.792 --> 01:21:14.458
and Taft repaid you by what,
putting you back out there?

01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:15.125
And Kate?

01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:18.250
Really?

01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:19.417
(Harrison sighs)

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:23.000
You need to understand who
really cares about you.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.750
Open your eyes.

01:21:36.166 --> 01:21:38.083
(Madison panting)

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:48.667
What are you so afraid of?

01:21:50.375 --> 01:21:51.250
- Nothing.

01:22:15.375 --> 01:22:17.083
(Harrison sighing)

01:22:24.625 --> 01:22:27.625
(front door closes)

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:30.250
-  Harry, she's
gone.

01:22:56.375 --> 01:22:59.041
(gun clicking)

01:23:11.208 --> 01:23:15.542
- C.O.N.T.A.G., give me
a report on warehouses

01:23:15.625 --> 01:23:18.750
in the ship channel, reference
disporsium.

01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:24.041
-  One warehouse
matching

01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:26.291
export records for disprosium.

01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:28.709
Location in Fallout Zone 12.

01:23:29.542 --> 01:23:34.333
Potential for rad absorption
levels, 200 to 300 units.

01:24:15.375 --> 01:24:18.041
(alien roar)

01:24:37.375 --> 01:24:40.875
(electricity crackling)

01:25:48.458 --> 01:25:50.917
(air hissing)

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.041
(Mikhail thudding)
(Harrison grunting)

01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:15.125
(gun firing)

01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:17.542
(both grunting)

01:26:17.625 --> 01:26:19.917
(gun firing)

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.041
(punches thudding)

01:26:32.792 --> 01:26:37.583
(high pitch ringing)

01:26:48.583 --> 01:26:51.583
- What kind of man are you?

01:26:51.667 --> 01:26:52.333
(gun clicking)

01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:53.750
- The killing kind.

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:57.875
(gun firing)

01:26:57.959 --> 01:27:02.875
(punches thudding)
(both grunting)

01:27:17.834 --> 01:27:20.959
(whooshing)

01:27:24.083 --> 01:27:25.458
- Come back to me.

01:27:44.375 --> 01:27:46.291
(Kate growling)
(Harrison gasping)

01:27:46.375 --> 01:27:49.166
(Harrison grunting)

01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:57.875
-  What scares you?

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:05.417
Perhaps, not knowing who you
are.

01:28:08.166 --> 01:28:09.291
- You don't know me.

01:28:10.083 --> 01:28:13.083
(Mikhail laughing)

01:28:13.166 --> 01:28:17.208
- You were trained for war.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:22.000
Mankind's gift to the universe.

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:28.917
And you're fighting for what?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:29.875
Nothing.

01:28:30.875 --> 01:28:32.500
But you,

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:39.750
you might be

01:28:39.834 --> 01:28:42.000
different now.

01:28:43.125 --> 01:28:44.000
- Different?

01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:46.542
- Yes.

01:28:47.917 --> 01:28:51.458
I am... different.

01:28:52.375 --> 01:28:53.834
Would you like to see?

01:28:55.583 --> 01:28:57.041
(tentacles crunching)

01:28:57.125 --> 01:29:00.250
(Mikhail shouting)

01:29:11.875 --> 01:29:13.959
(breathing heavy)

01:29:18.333 --> 01:29:22.083
Now, do you see?

01:29:22.166 --> 01:29:26.375
The Legion has taken everything
from me.

01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:32.500
And now all that is left is this
hate.

01:29:33.125 --> 01:29:37.750
Just like a human.

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:40.667
- You're not human.

01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:45.625
- (chuckles) No.

01:29:46.583 --> 01:29:48.709
I am

01:29:48.792 --> 01:29:53.125
so much more.

01:29:53.208 --> 01:29:55.792
(tentacles whipping)

01:29:58.417 --> 01:30:00.625
Have you ever lost someone?

01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:04.959
Then you know what it's like.

01:30:06.875 --> 01:30:08.208
-  What, pain?

01:30:09.583 --> 01:30:09.625
- No (chuckles).

01:30:11.041 --> 01:30:13.375
Pain is easy

01:30:13.458 --> 01:30:17.583
to control, to hide.

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:26.500
Revenge, that is

01:30:26.583 --> 01:30:28.000
not so easy.

01:30:30.583 --> 01:30:35.125
You are here to kill me
to avenge their deaths.

01:30:36.041 --> 01:30:38.583
But part of you does not want to
do it.

01:30:39.917 --> 01:30:40.792
Why?

01:30:43.041 --> 01:30:45.959
Perhaps it is because I am more
like you

01:30:46.583 --> 01:30:51.166
and you are more like...

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:53.625
(gun firing)

01:31:11.291 --> 01:31:13.291
That's it, little man.

01:31:14.333 --> 01:31:17.917
Become that which you hunt.

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:25.792
- That's it.

01:31:26.792 --> 01:31:28.375
Keep coming.

01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:29.291
Come on.

01:32:35.542 --> 01:32:39.208
- You cannot run away from who
you are.

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:42.000
- Who's running?

01:32:42.083 --> 01:32:43.458
(gun firing)

01:32:43.542 --> 01:32:45.625
(body landing thud)

01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:47.709
(Harrison panting)

01:33:11.959 --> 01:33:14.709
(Harrison panting)

01:33:42.458 --> 01:33:44.750
(Mikhail's body clattering)

01:33:44.834 --> 01:33:46.583
(Harrison grunting)

01:34:04.041 --> 01:34:07.041
(Harrison grunting)

01:34:16.333 --> 01:34:19.500
(metal fence jingling)

01:34:28.542 --> 01:34:31.375
(Harrison grunting)

01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:37.750
(Madison grunting)

01:34:37.834 --> 01:34:38.834
(both panting)

01:34:40.625 --> 01:34:42.000
- Told you someone's
gonna keep an eye on you.

01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:45.959
(both grunting)

01:34:59.208 --> 01:35:01.959
(transport ship rumbling)

01:35:48.208 --> 01:35:50.125
-  What do you
remember

01:35:50.208 --> 01:35:51.542
after the accident?

01:35:51.625 --> 01:35:52.959
What about all those months you
spent

01:35:53.041 --> 01:35:54.417
at the clinic with Kate?

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:57.917
When this is done,

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.750
whatever it is, my advice is
for you to leave the city.

01:36:02.834 --> 01:36:05.709
-  There's
a traitor in The Legion.

01:36:05.792 --> 01:36:08.792
-  What
scares you?

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:13.083
Perhaps, not knowing who you
are.

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:25.250
(Harrison exhales)

01:36:26.166 --> 01:36:29.291
-  Open your
eyes.
