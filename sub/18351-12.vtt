00:03.006 --> 00:04.408
- Hello! - ( all screaming
) Rita Ora is at our house.

00:04.408 --> 00:06.013
Rita:
<i>I wanna do one.</i>

00:06.013 --> 00:08.249
No, I wasn't ready.

00:08.249 --> 00:09.986
Tomorrow, you're gonna
experience my fast-paced life.

00:09.986 --> 00:13.861
Courtney: <i>We get
swarmed by paparazzi!</i>

00:13.861 --> 00:16.499
David:
Today we're gonna be shooting
for the cover

00:16.499 --> 00:18.002
<i>of "Paper"
magazine.</i>

00:18.002 --> 00:19.673
Being on the cover
of a magazine

00:19.673 --> 00:21.009
is that "I've made it"
moment for everyone.

00:21.009 --> 00:23.981
Cody nailed it
in the first frame.

00:23.981 --> 00:27.623
<i>Don't do weird hands.
Make it pretty.</i>

00:27.623 --> 00:29.726
You're not gonna like
any of these pictures.

00:29.726 --> 00:31.062
Being a boss
means being confident
in any kind of photo.

00:31.062 --> 00:36.172
<i>So who stays?
Courtney.</i>

00:36.172 --> 00:37.676
Cody:
<i>My other half is still
in here fighting</i>

00:37.676 --> 00:39.546
<i>and just
gonna kill it.</i>

00:39.546 --> 00:40.881
<i>( theme music
playing )</i>

01:24.937 --> 01:29.680
- Woo!
- Yes, go me!

01:29.680 --> 01:32.251
Cody:
<i>My sister got eliminated,</i>

01:32.251 --> 01:34.054
<i>but I've just been
modeling a lot longer</i>

01:34.054 --> 01:35.959
<i>and I think that really
shows in my photos.</i>

01:35.959 --> 01:37.729
<i>And now I've gone into
the top five.</i>

01:37.729 --> 01:40.200
<i>I'm ( bleep ) amazing.</i>

01:40.200 --> 01:42.171
<i>There's no ifs, ands, or buts
about it.</i>

01:42.171 --> 01:44.610
I am a damn good model.

01:44.610 --> 01:47.114
You guys don't wanna
stare at my picture?

01:47.114 --> 01:49.118
Now Tash is gone and Cody
is just really feeling herself.

01:49.118 --> 01:51.957
<i>Like, "Okay, look at me,
like, I got this.</i>

01:51.957 --> 01:54.295
<i>I have my
signature face."</i>

01:54.295 --> 01:55.197
Cody is the type of person--
she thinks that she has it all.

01:55.197 --> 01:57.969
Whoo.

02:02.210 --> 02:06.988
India:
<i>Oh, you got a package.</i>

02:06.988 --> 02:08.090
Coryanne:Look it,
this is me and my dad.

02:08.090 --> 02:09.993
India:
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

02:09.993 --> 02:11.496
<i>Wow, you look so,
like, different.</i>

02:11.496 --> 02:13.667
He's Italian
you should read this.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.772
It sounds likehe's so foreign.

02:15.772 --> 02:17.207
"How are you, my love?
I truly hope you are great.

02:17.207 --> 02:19.613
You are always in
mythoughts and in my heart.

02:19.613 --> 02:21.249
I hope all is
well with you

02:21.249 --> 02:22.652
and that you're having
an amazing experience.

02:22.652 --> 02:24.657
- Aw!
- I love you, Dad."

02:24.657 --> 02:27.227
- Aw!
- So cute.

02:27.227 --> 02:29.666
Coryanne:
<i>I lived with my dad and Molly
until I was 14.</i>

02:29.666 --> 02:32.839
<i>I saw my mom every year,
every other year sometimes.</i>

02:32.839 --> 02:35.177
<i>Yeah, she was a supermodel,
but she kinda got lost in
it.</i>

02:35.177 --> 02:37.081
<i>And just recently she
really cleaned up her act.</i>

02:37.081 --> 02:40.855
We have gotten
a lot closer.

02:40.855 --> 02:42.525
She lives with me,
and I just want her to know

02:42.525 --> 02:45.097
<i>that she's definitely
an inspiration for me.</i>

02:45.097 --> 02:47.134
- This gave me a little
happiness for the evening.
- ( India laughs )

02:47.134 --> 02:50.140
- <i>( TV chimes )</i>
- Rita Alert!

02:52.912 --> 02:57.188
Hi, ladies,
as you're aware,

02:57.188 --> 02:58.691
a top model needs to be more
than just a pretty face.

02:58.691 --> 03:01.530
You need to play the part.
Good luck.

03:01.530 --> 03:05.203
- Oh, gosh.
- Play the part.

03:05.203 --> 03:06.707
- <i>Great.</i>
- I think it's acting.

03:06.707 --> 03:08.376
- Yeah.
- To make up our own play.

03:08.376 --> 03:10.882
If this is an acting challenge,
pssh, I got this

03:10.882 --> 03:13.821
because acting
is a passion of mine

03:13.821 --> 03:15.992
and if I can't show
that I can act,

03:15.992 --> 03:18.564
then how could I have
a future doing that?

03:18.564 --> 03:20.066
- Cody: <i>So memorizing lines.</i>
- Yeah, getting into
character.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.970
I wanna be
a creative director.

03:33.160 --> 03:37.836
- Hello!
- Hello!

03:37.836 --> 03:41.744
Today, we're gonna focus
on an aspect of my career

03:41.744 --> 03:44.248
that I'm very
excited about.

03:44.248 --> 03:47.689
Acting!

03:47.689 --> 03:49.760
After appearing in "Southpaw"
and the "Fifty Shades" series,

03:49.760 --> 03:53.065
I got the acting bug.

03:53.065 --> 03:54.602
Even if you don't want to
pursue acting as a career,

03:54.602 --> 03:56.973
it's very important
to use this tool

03:56.973 --> 03:59.646
to get in touch
with your emotions.

03:59.646 --> 04:01.550
Tatiana:
Acting I suck at,
straight up.

04:01.550 --> 04:03.587
I have many talents,
but one of them is not
acting at all.

04:03.587 --> 04:07.829
To help you guys
develop your acting skills,

04:07.829 --> 04:10.166
I've brought in legendary
acting coach Susan Batson.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.941
- Hello, ladies.
- Susan's worked
with Nicole Kidman,

04:13.941 --> 04:17.114
<i>Kerry Washington,
and even Naomi Campbell.</i>

04:17.114 --> 04:19.953
I'm gonna be taking a
seat, so come on up here.

04:19.953 --> 04:21.690
Okay, today we're going
to do an emotional memory.

04:23.226 --> 04:27.903
The emotional memory that we're
gonna be working on is of loss.

04:27.903 --> 04:30.774
Does everybody
have a big loss?

04:32.612 --> 04:33.747
How long ago
was this loss?

04:37.421 --> 04:40.093
<i>Can you remember
what you were wearing?</i>

04:40.093 --> 04:41.763
Can you remember
what you deeply needed
at the time of this loss?

04:41.763 --> 04:46.439
India,
what did you need?

04:46.439 --> 04:50.815
- Guidance.
- Guidance, okay.

04:50.815 --> 04:52.986
I'm not a super
emotional person usually,

04:52.986 --> 04:55.824
<i>but we all get in touch
with some loss in our lives</i>

04:55.824 --> 04:58.630
and I have never won
a challenge.

04:58.630 --> 05:00.735
So, tapping into the
sadness was really important
today.

05:00.735 --> 05:03.574
We are, now gonna
take all of this

05:03.574 --> 05:07.081
to use it,put it into acting.

05:07.081 --> 05:09.085
Okay. Now, we're gonna
give you a scene to act out.

05:09.085 --> 05:13.292
But, you're not gonna be
doing this alone.

05:13.292 --> 05:14.294
- Ah!
- Please, welcome
Adrienne Moore.

05:16.466 --> 05:20.173
Hello.

05:20.173 --> 05:22.277
Rita:
She plays Black Cindy
in "Orange is the New Black."

05:22.277 --> 05:24.649
So Adrienne is actually
here to act out the scene
with you guys today.

05:24.649 --> 05:28.022
Coryanne:
Oh, my God, that's one of
my favorite shows.

05:28.022 --> 05:30.628
<i>I've followed it
from the beginning.</i>

05:30.628 --> 05:32.298
It's such an honor
to work with her.

05:32.298 --> 05:35.170
I'm honored to be
working with you guys.

05:35.170 --> 05:37.274
It's just about being free
and letting the emotion

05:37.274 --> 05:39.345
and the truth of the
feeling just permeate, you know,
through your body.

05:39.345 --> 05:43.286
<i>The scene that you
guys have to do today</i>

05:43.286 --> 05:45.356
is just talking about truth.

05:45.356 --> 05:46.693
Cody: <i>The fact that
Adrienne is here</i>

05:46.693 --> 05:48.430
and I'm gonna be doing
a scene with her

05:48.430 --> 05:50.100
is a little bit
nerve-wracking.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.170
But having her here is, like,
a huge blessing

05:52.170 --> 05:54.041
and a huge, like, honor.
And I just wanna impress her.

05:54.041 --> 05:57.147
Underneath all
of this dialogue

05:57.147 --> 06:00.888
is this feeling of loss.

06:00.888 --> 06:02.559
You're there to get help
from Sylvia, which is Adrienne.

06:02.559 --> 06:06.566
There's a moment
where they say,

06:06.566 --> 06:08.670
Jackie, who is
your character, cries.

06:08.670 --> 06:11.042
At that moment
you have to cry.

06:11.042 --> 06:14.048
On the spot.

06:14.048 --> 06:15.885
You have 30 minutes
to learn the lines.

06:15.885 --> 06:17.622
Courtney: <i>It's a
very emotional scene</i>

06:17.622 --> 06:19.224
and we have 30 minutes
to memorize it

06:19.224 --> 06:20.794
<i>and there's this amazing
actress, then there's Rita.</i>

06:20.794 --> 06:23.734
The pressure
is basically on.

06:23.734 --> 06:25.337
Why don't you just find
a space in the theater?

06:25.337 --> 06:27.307
I'll be aroundif you
have any questions.

06:27.307 --> 06:30.080
Memorizing the lines,

06:30.080 --> 06:32.050
I'm trying to just recite it
as much as I can in my head

06:32.050 --> 06:34.187
<i>but something in my brain
it just doesn't click,</i>

06:34.187 --> 06:35.658
<i>like,
I just can't do it.</i>

06:35.658 --> 06:36.660
So, how are you?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.501
<i>Oh, my God, acting really
just had to tap in.</i>

06:40.501 --> 06:42.404
It's how you become
a good actress.

06:42.404 --> 06:43.740
You use real emotions.

06:51.389 --> 06:55.029
Oh.

06:57.267 --> 06:59.237
Do you keep feeling that
there is more you could've done?

07:03.012 --> 07:08.056
Boy, you're there.
Stay there, okay?

07:08.056 --> 07:09.592
Tatiana:
The scene is about someone
wanting to be a star

07:12.865 --> 07:16.272
though it means, and basically
her cousin being like,

07:16.272 --> 07:18.777
"Okay, well, you just need
to kinda look inside yourself

07:18.777 --> 07:20.782
<i>in order to
achieve that."</i>

07:20.782 --> 07:21.683
Hey, ladies.
Time's up.

07:24.288 --> 07:27.094
I'm very excited.
As they say in the theater,
"Break a leg."

07:27.094 --> 07:29.966
- Okay, you're gonna put
the paper on the floor, okay?
- Okay.

07:31.469 --> 07:33.607
Susan:
Okay.

07:36.145 --> 07:37.549
- I'm not eating
until I'm famous.
- Famous?

07:37.549 --> 07:40.922
Just go write a book.

07:40.922 --> 07:42.959
I don't know anything.

07:42.959 --> 07:45.230
I'm nervous, I'm cold,
the lights were bright.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.267
I just really honestly was
freaking out inside of my head.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.706
I'll just go on
a hungry strike,
like what's his name?

07:49.706 --> 07:51.475
Are you referring
to the great pacifist Gandhi?

07:53.814 --> 07:54.081
Yeah, him.
He got famous, right?

07:58.256 --> 08:00.995
Tatiana--
Ha!

08:00.995 --> 08:02.798
She gave up her
emotionality to make sure she
had that line.

08:03.734 --> 08:08.777
<i>And that killed her work.</i>

08:08.777 --> 08:10.515
Then tell me something,
what's the most important thing

08:10.515 --> 08:12.852
to you in life?
Really think about that.

08:12.852 --> 08:16.325
- Truth.
- I always knew
you were special.

08:16.325 --> 08:19.966
Cut. Thank you.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.369
Tatiana:
<i>I know I bombed
this challenge.</i>

08:21.369 --> 08:23.172
<i>I should've channeled
the character</i>

08:23.172 --> 08:25.343
but I couldn't remember
the lines.

08:25.343 --> 08:26.513
- You can breathe. ( laughs )
- Oh, gosh, thank you, guys.

08:26.513 --> 08:29.853
That was a bad scene.

08:29.853 --> 08:34.629
- I'm India.
- Such an honor to meet you.

08:34.629 --> 08:36.165
India:
It is a tough scene,
and we have to cry on cue.

08:36.165 --> 08:39.371
Susan's activity
definitely helped me

08:39.371 --> 08:42.344
with just being emotional,
so I think I'll be fine.

08:42.344 --> 08:44.649
- Action.
- I'm going on hunger strike,
like-- like what's his name?

08:45.383 --> 08:50.160
You got some imagination.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.030
Are you talking about
the great pacifist Gandhi?

08:52.030 --> 08:54.402
Yeah, him.

08:54.402 --> 08:56.439
I mean...

08:56.439 --> 08:59.211
He got famous, right?

08:59.211 --> 09:00.380
You just wanna be famous,
just go write a book, Jackie.

09:00.380 --> 09:04.556
You're--
you're the crazy one.

09:04.556 --> 09:06.993
What am I gonna write
a book about?

09:06.993 --> 09:07.895
India, her challenge to
work on is to not act so much.

09:09.633 --> 09:14.576
Just be in that moment
and not think, "Okay,
if I'm frustrated,

09:14.576 --> 09:17.849
then I have to act
like I'm frustrated."

09:17.849 --> 09:19.652
What's the most important
thing to you?

09:19.652 --> 09:22.024
( sobbing )
I don't know.

09:22.024 --> 09:25.029
Truth.

09:25.029 --> 09:27.602
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:27.602 --> 09:28.837
- She was very acty.
- Yeah.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.413
Susan:
<i>Next.</i>

09:33.413 --> 09:35.049
Cody: <i>Now that my
sister is gone,</i>

09:35.049 --> 09:36.820
<i>I'm doing my thing
and I'm happy.</i>

09:36.820 --> 09:38.089
So I might have a hard time
channeling loss.

09:38.089 --> 09:41.897
Action!

09:41.897 --> 09:43.266
I won't eat
until I'm famous.

09:43.266 --> 09:46.272
- It takes at least 15
years. - I don't care.

09:46.272 --> 09:49.846
Adrienne:
What's the most important
thing to you in life?

09:49.846 --> 09:52.183
Now, I want you to really
think about this one.

09:52.183 --> 09:55.456
Cody:
<i>I'm-- I can't--
I can't cry.</i>

09:55.456 --> 09:58.597
<i>I would love to give
the tears that they want,</i>

09:58.597 --> 09:59.130
<i>but I just can't...</i>

10:01.637 --> 10:02.605
<i>My sister was holding me
back. Now, I feel so free.</i>

10:02.605 --> 10:06.713
I can't be sad.

10:06.713 --> 10:07.715
I don't know anything.

10:10.955 --> 10:12.858
- Truth.
- That was
an incredible example

10:12.858 --> 10:15.297
of someone bringing their
real life into the scene.

10:15.297 --> 10:17.467
You're gonna let your
inner crazy run wild.

10:17.467 --> 10:21.810
<i>Work your hair.</i>

10:21.810 --> 10:22.979
She looks like a unicorn
( bleep ) on her face.

10:22.979 --> 10:25.751
I wanted it
to be gorgeous.

10:25.751 --> 10:26.285
And it was the first time
that I didn't think you looked
beautiful.

10:39.478 --> 10:44.421
Courtney:
Today's challenge is all about
tapping into your emotions

10:44.421 --> 10:47.127
<i>and being able
to portray it onstage.</i>

10:47.127 --> 10:49.999
And I have buckets and
buckets of memories

10:49.999 --> 10:54.107
with a lot of hard emotion
attached to them.

10:54.107 --> 10:57.313
So, it doesn't take me much
to dig deep and tap into those.

10:58.584 --> 11:03.092
I won't eat
until I'm famous.

11:03.092 --> 11:06.098
Well, honey.
You just wanna be famous.

11:06.098 --> 11:10.641
- Write a book.
- You're crazy.

11:10.641 --> 11:14.148
Why don't you
write a book?

11:14.148 --> 11:16.485
Adrienne:
Courtney came on
to the stage full.

11:16.485 --> 11:19.158
<i>When you have those emotional
moments when you are so
ready,</i>

11:19.158 --> 11:21.295
you can never go wrong
in those moments.

11:21.295 --> 11:23.266
Well, what do you know?
Hmm?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.771
I don't know anything.

11:25.771 --> 11:27.440
I know that I like
nice things.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.944
All right, and you also
know who's sleeping with who

11:28.944 --> 11:33.520
and who's in rehab, right?

11:33.520 --> 11:36.158
Tell me something, what's
the most important thing to you?

11:36.158 --> 11:38.663
Now, take your time...
really think about it.

11:38.663 --> 11:41.001
- Truth.
- What?

11:41.001 --> 11:43.640
Truth.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.007
Come here,
come here.

11:48.684 --> 11:53.125
Cut.
Thank you.

11:53.125 --> 11:56.198
That was an
incredible example

11:56.198 --> 11:57.969
of someone really bringing
their real life into the scene.

11:57.969 --> 12:01.643
You know,
she used to be homeless,
she never had a family.

12:01.643 --> 12:02.343
- All of that just kinda
came into one and I really felt
it. - Yeah.

12:05.985 --> 12:07.655
- Action.
- I won't eat until...
I am famous.

12:10.994 --> 12:15.804
Adrienne:
It's gonna take you
at least 15 years

12:15.804 --> 12:18.042
- <i>to become a
household--</i> - I don't care.

12:18.042 --> 12:20.681
Adrienne:
<i>Write a book.</i>

12:20.681 --> 12:22.417
What am I gonna write....
a book about?

12:22.417 --> 12:25.724
What do you know?

12:25.724 --> 12:26.593
I know...
that I like nice things.

12:26.593 --> 12:30.233
( laughing )
Yeah.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.270
For me I channeled
my mom losing herself

12:32.270 --> 12:35.076
and me losing
my relationship with my mom.

12:35.076 --> 12:38.082
Adrienne:
What's the most important
in your life, huh?

12:38.082 --> 12:40.286
<i>Now-- now--
now, take your time.</i>

12:40.286 --> 12:41.690
Growing up I looked at her
as kinda like this super hero.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.960
Someone that
could do no wrong.

12:43.960 --> 12:44.629
<i>And so for me, it was losing
that image of her.</i>

12:44.629 --> 12:47.969
Truth.

12:47.969 --> 12:50.173
What?

12:50.173 --> 12:51.843
Truth.

12:51.843 --> 12:52.176
God, I always knew
you were special.

12:54.849 --> 12:55.349
Coryanne, she was able
to reach in and pull it out

12:59.191 --> 13:02.230
and tell the truth.

13:04.970 --> 13:08.543
Yay!

13:10.881 --> 13:13.052
First of all, I've been
very impressed with all of you.

13:13.052 --> 13:15.925
Cody, there was a fear.
You do not have to push it.

13:15.925 --> 13:19.899
I think what it is
is you may sometimes

13:19.899 --> 13:22.170
- underestimate your
power. - Ah, that's right.

13:22.170 --> 13:26.412
Just let whatever
is going on inside happen.

13:26.412 --> 13:29.785
And don't feel like
you have to make yourself cry

13:29.785 --> 13:32.223
or squint your fa--
just let it be.

13:32.223 --> 13:35.129
Tatiana, the thing
that pained me

13:35.129 --> 13:37.000
is that you valued
the stupid words
on the paper

13:37.000 --> 13:42.143
instead of valuing
who you are.

13:42.143 --> 13:45.751
Tatiana:
I only looked at the paper
to finish this scene

13:45.751 --> 13:47.688
and do it some type
of justice

13:47.688 --> 13:49.024
because I literally was just
gonna sit there and say nothing.

13:49.024 --> 13:51.963
Susan:
<i>Now to Courtney.</i>

13:51.963 --> 13:53.600
You jumped in. Everything
was full, very present.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.808
- You had a purpose.
- Yeah.

13:57.808 --> 13:59.612
The intention, everything.
I think you're an actress.

13:59.612 --> 14:02.317
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Thank you.

14:02.317 --> 14:04.354
India, I like to think
of acting or modeling

14:04.354 --> 14:07.828
kinda like
a rollercoaster.

14:07.828 --> 14:09.164
Like you know you're about
to go up this hill,

14:09.164 --> 14:10.601
you're about to go
down the hill,

14:10.601 --> 14:11.970
you're about
to go on a circle.

14:11.970 --> 14:13.438
But it's allowing yourself
the freedom

14:13.438 --> 14:15.476
to wait for that moment
to happen.

14:15.476 --> 14:17.849
so then you can really
experience it in a truthful way.

14:17.849 --> 14:21.054
I hope that she's not saying
that I was overacting,

14:21.054 --> 14:24.061
'cause that would be
a huge disappointment.

14:24.061 --> 14:25.831
Susan:
Coryanne,
really quite powerful.

14:25.831 --> 14:28.236
- It was really good.
- Yeah.

14:28.236 --> 14:29.706
When you went into
the emotional light,

14:29.706 --> 14:33.379
<i>we could really feel you.</i>

14:33.379 --> 14:35.517
You can do all your homework
for the character and know all
your lines,

14:35.517 --> 14:39.358
but when you get
out on that stage,
forget everything.

14:39.358 --> 14:41.530
And just live in the moment
because that's what life is.

14:41.530 --> 14:45.538
Really good.

14:45.538 --> 14:46.204
The winner of this
challenge is...

14:47.575 --> 14:49.645
Courtney.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.987
Oh, my God,
thank you.

14:53.987 --> 14:54.655
And I would like to offer
you a two-hour consultation

14:56.826 --> 15:01.703
- with me to talk
about the work.
- Thank you.

15:01.703 --> 15:04.676
I won three challenges in a row,
so I'm pretty freaking stoked.

15:04.676 --> 15:08.148
Last week, I was in bottom two
and now, to redeem myself,

15:08.148 --> 15:12.859
I just won a really hard
challenge.

15:12.859 --> 15:14.662
- Thank you so much.
- I've never seen you
all this vulnerable,

15:14.662 --> 15:18.035
<i>especially at
the same time.</i>

15:18.035 --> 15:20.240
My advice to you would be
just keep that in mind

15:20.240 --> 15:22.377
<i>and tap into that,
so moving forward
in this competition,</i>

15:22.377 --> 15:25.016
there's a realness
to every single one of you.

15:25.016 --> 15:27.855
I will see you guys
at elimination.

15:27.855 --> 15:29.057
- Bye.
- Thank you.

15:35.103 --> 15:38.843
Courtney:
Three challenges in a row!
You guys all hate me.

15:41.716 --> 15:42.684
What the hell?
Why would I want
people to hate me?

15:46.793 --> 15:49.699
Cody:
Like we just cried on stage
and all tried so hard

15:49.699 --> 15:52.203
and you come back here
and you're like,
"Three challenges in a row."

15:52.203 --> 15:54.709
Uh, really?
Even if you were thinking it,
did you have to say it?

15:54.709 --> 15:57.213
- I can't be proud of
myself? - I don't know, it's
just, like, not the time.

15:57.213 --> 16:00.386
I know that Courtney
did amazing

16:00.386 --> 16:03.326
<i>and that is so sad</i>

16:03.326 --> 16:04.795
that the other girls
can't find enough good
in themselves

16:04.795 --> 16:08.402
<i>to be happy for her.</i>

16:08.402 --> 16:09.639
- Oh, come on, Cory.
- <i>I would never say that</i>

16:09.639 --> 16:12.144
if it was me,
that's my thing.

16:12.144 --> 16:13.312
I was just like,
"Wow, how insensitive."

16:13.312 --> 16:14.448
That's what I thought.

16:14.448 --> 16:16.251
Oh, ( bleep ) you, Cody.

16:16.251 --> 16:17.286
<i>You didn't win any challenges
this week or last week.</i>

16:17.286 --> 16:20.459
Like, you suck.

16:20.459 --> 16:20.727
Go crazy.
Let's see the wig go.

16:23.332 --> 16:25.638
India:
Well, crap,
my wig got stuck.

16:25.638 --> 16:28.610
Drew: <i>Pull.</i>

16:28.610 --> 16:29.511
I didn't think
you looked beautiful.

16:29.511 --> 16:31.314
This is crazy.

16:42.538 --> 16:47.079
What would you guys
do without me?

16:47.079 --> 16:48.683
<i>That's what I
want to know.</i>

16:48.683 --> 16:50.120
The dishes would
never get done.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.956
- <i>( TV chimes )</i>
- Woman: Rita Alert.

16:51.956 --> 16:53.826
Tatiana:
<i>Women of the house.</i>

16:55.530 --> 16:55.630
Hi, ladies,
it's been said

17:00.039 --> 17:01.308
the beauty is in
the eye of the beholder.

17:01.308 --> 17:04.280
Show me your crazy.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.485
- All: Ooh!
- Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

17:06.485 --> 17:09.658
There's crazy
and there's model crazy.

17:09.658 --> 17:13.900
I think we're going
to be "ugly- pretty."

17:13.900 --> 17:15.837
We're gonna get wrinkles
or beards or something.

17:15.837 --> 17:18.877
and have to...
work through them.

17:18.877 --> 17:20.881
It's like making faces
and ( bleep ), like,

17:20.881 --> 17:22.518
being able to pose
but not like, you know,
like this. It's like--

17:22.518 --> 17:25.489
Once again, I'll try
really hard to win.

17:25.489 --> 17:29.498
The acting challenge was,
like, a really emotional
challenge.

17:29.498 --> 17:32.738
You know, we were all
crying and I really, really
wanted to win.

17:32.738 --> 17:34.709
<i>So I do have anxiety
at a challenge, I have
anxiety at a shoot.</i>

17:34.709 --> 17:36.679
You're always under pressure,
you always feel tense.

17:36.679 --> 17:39.017
- ( yawns ) My goodness.
- Okay.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.054
The panel said
that my photo set the bar.

17:41.054 --> 17:44.027
I don't think it's gonna be
hard for me to maintain that.

17:44.027 --> 17:47.067
<i>It's down to
the final five,</i>

17:47.067 --> 17:48.604
<i>and I feel like some
people feel threatened.</i>

17:48.604 --> 17:50.841
And I'm alienating myself
from the girls

17:50.841 --> 17:52.678
<i>so I can focus on winning.
I got this.</i>

18:04.200 --> 18:08.242
Hello, hello, hello,
my final five.

18:08.242 --> 18:11.516
Hello, Drew.

18:11.516 --> 18:12.851
Yesterday you learned
all about

18:12.851 --> 18:14.421
emoting with words
through acting.

18:14.421 --> 18:16.559
Today you're gonna needto
emote, but without words.

18:16.559 --> 18:19.097
Because modeling is really
like silent acting.

18:19.097 --> 18:22.203
We're gonna a shoot
a short beauty video...

18:22.203 --> 18:24.675
where you're gonna let
your inner crazy run wild!

18:24.675 --> 18:29.051
Girls:
<i>Ooh!</i>

18:29.051 --> 18:29.551
Your job today is to
evolve from gorgeous Top Model

18:30.921 --> 18:35.462
to model gone mad!

18:35.462 --> 18:38.235
You're being shot
by three cameras.

18:38.235 --> 18:40.541
The final video is gonna be
played in reverse.

18:40.541 --> 18:43.279
And you only have
one take to get it.

18:43.279 --> 18:46.920
- Wow!
- Yay!

18:46.920 --> 18:48.657
All right, well,
get into hair and make-up,

18:48.657 --> 18:49.758
let's roll, let's roll.

18:55.235 --> 18:59.778
Love it.

18:59.778 --> 19:01.916
I think the key
to this video shoot

19:01.916 --> 19:04.454
is going to be not
being afraid to be ugly,

19:04.454 --> 19:07.160
<i>not to be afraid to step
outside of your comfort
zone.</i>

19:07.160 --> 19:09.932
<i>I do have
a lot of inner crazy</i>

19:09.932 --> 19:11.268
and I'm not afraid
to do that at all.

19:11.268 --> 19:14.775
Oh, bless.

19:14.775 --> 19:16.278
Hey, guys.
On your hands

19:16.278 --> 19:18.517
is going to be the same shade
of make-up that is on--

19:18.517 --> 19:22.591
One hand will have your lips and
one hand will have your eyes.

19:22.591 --> 19:26.632
You do not want to keep
fussing with the make-up

19:26.632 --> 19:30.139
because you will end up
looking a very odd color.

19:30.139 --> 19:33.680
'Cause we don't want it
to be muddy and gross.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.584
<i>I know it's
a lot to think about.
I'll help cue you.</i>

19:35.584 --> 19:38.455
It's really crunch time
because at this point

19:38.455 --> 19:39.959
we all know we
can take good pictures,
we're all good models,

19:39.959 --> 19:41.996
<i>but they really want
a superstar.</i>

19:41.996 --> 19:43.634
<i>Gonna be representing VH1
with a talent contract.</i>

19:43.634 --> 19:45.604
<i>They need to be able to see
the potential in your talent</i>

19:45.604 --> 19:48.275
and your personality.
But I can do this.

19:48.275 --> 19:51.014
- Courtney!
- Hello!

19:51.014 --> 19:55.724
- Oh, my goodness,
you look pretty.
- Thank you.

19:55.724 --> 19:58.162
I think the other girls
might be scared to...

19:58.162 --> 20:01.167
<i>project the
actual craziness</i>

20:01.167 --> 20:03.472
into this video but I'm ready
to be a beautiful disaster.

20:03.472 --> 20:07.113
Five, four, three, two, one,

20:09.050 --> 20:13.359
<i>and rolling!</i>

20:13.359 --> 20:14.962
Drew:
<i>Beauty.</i>

20:14.962 --> 20:16.131
There's a shift... wig.
There you go.

20:16.131 --> 20:20.372
Let me see that lip color.

20:20.372 --> 20:20.907
More on your face.

20:23.179 --> 20:24.347
<i>Oh, that's great!</i>

20:24.347 --> 20:26.485
Work your hair.

20:26.485 --> 20:28.657
I did really get
into, like, my emotions...

20:28.657 --> 20:31.663
Drew:
But you're still
beautiful.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.331
...but this is a beauty shoot,
so the last thing that I want

20:33.331 --> 20:35.537
is to look like I'm having
a very painful orgasm.

20:35.537 --> 20:39.545
- Fab.
- Thank you.

20:39.545 --> 20:41.683
- Cody. Are you ready?
- I'm so ready.

20:41.683 --> 20:44.387
They're gonna put lots
of make-up on you.

20:44.387 --> 20:46.692
Use it as single
opportunities.

20:46.692 --> 20:48.697
- You know what I'm
saying? - Okay. Not to just--

20:48.697 --> 20:50.534
The other thing too is,
I'll tell you when to
take your wig off.

20:50.534 --> 20:53.205
I can't imagine Cody
being angry or sad

20:53.205 --> 20:56.880
<i>or just like super emotional
on set during this video.</i>

20:56.880 --> 20:58.884
<i>Even last week when
Cody got Best Photo,</i>

20:58.884 --> 21:00.520
I didn't see it.
There's no energy in her face.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.392
And five, four, three,

21:03.392 --> 21:06.464
two, one,
go, rolling.

21:06.464 --> 21:10.173
I need more regal
at this moment.

21:10.173 --> 21:12.544
<i>More like--
Yeah, there you go.</i>

21:12.544 --> 21:13.714
That's the ticket.
Are we ready?

21:13.714 --> 21:16.084
<i>Wig...
wig reveal.</i>

21:16.084 --> 21:20.861
Let's take the wig off.

21:20.861 --> 21:22.932
<i>I just wish she would've
listened to my directions.</i>

21:22.932 --> 21:25.637
She started
polka dotting her face.

21:25.637 --> 21:27.641
<i>What's happening?
It looked weird.</i>

21:27.641 --> 21:29.243
It lost the magic of what
we were trying to create.

21:29.243 --> 21:32.416
Let's get rid of the wig.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.922
Remember
it's a beauty campaign.

21:34.922 --> 21:39.331
Tatiana:
Cody is just in her
own world sometimes.

21:39.331 --> 21:41.134
<i>And she looked crazy,
I don't know how this is gonna
translate on video.</i>

21:41.134 --> 21:44.373
All she has was, like,
blue and white on her forehead.

21:44.373 --> 21:46.712
<i>It just wasn't the most
flattering thing.</i>

21:46.712 --> 21:49.719
This is a very interesting
look right now.

21:49.719 --> 21:50.085
The paint that I smeared
on my face looked like
a Picasso painting

21:54.093 --> 21:56.966
<i>So I'm like,
"Okay, cool."</i>

21:56.966 --> 21:58.737
If I was able to smear
my make-up on beautifully

21:58.737 --> 22:00.673
then maybe
I got a good shot.

22:02.276 --> 22:02.343
Yeah.

22:07.119 --> 22:08.523
When you look like a unicorn
( bleep ) on your face,

22:08.523 --> 22:10.292
how could you come back
super confident?

22:10.292 --> 22:11.595
All right, India.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.070
India,
are you ready?

22:16.070 --> 22:17.808
<i>I am feeling
pretty confident</i>

22:17.808 --> 22:19.177
but the pressure is a little
overwhelming, I guess.

22:19.177 --> 22:22.618
<i>because we're down
to the wire</i>

22:22.618 --> 22:24.187
<i>and at the challenge
I didn't do well.</i>

22:24.187 --> 22:25.757
I need to work extra,
extra hard to prove myself.

22:25.757 --> 22:29.598
Three, two, one,
action, rolling.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.538
Drew:
<i>Beauty, there you go.</i>

22:32.538 --> 22:33.773
Let's see the wig go.

22:36.178 --> 22:40.887
India:
Well, crap.
My wig got stuck.

22:40.887 --> 22:43.492
Let's get that wig out
from behind you. Try! Pull!

22:43.492 --> 22:46.532
<i>Let's see the wig go.</i>

22:46.532 --> 22:46.999
This outfit is
driving me crazy.

22:51.007 --> 22:53.713
From here to here
you look super model,

22:53.713 --> 22:55.650
from here to here
it's supermarket.

22:55.650 --> 22:56.652
- Oh, my God, Lou.
- Oh!

23:10.079 --> 23:15.088
Drew:
<i>Let's see the wig.</i>

23:15.088 --> 23:17.160
<i>India:
Well, crap...
my wig got stuck.</i>

23:17.160 --> 23:21.769
So, I'm like,
"Okay, great."

23:21.769 --> 23:24.006
<i>And I was just like,
"Okay, keep going."</i>

23:24.006 --> 23:27.413
Let's get that wig out
from behind you. Try! Pull!

23:27.413 --> 23:31.722
Now let's see
more eyes gone.

23:31.722 --> 23:33.358
When I was watching India,
she wasn't really getting it.

23:33.358 --> 23:36.999
<i>Paint in smear,
wig didn't come off.</i>

23:36.999 --> 23:39.104
I really don't know
what the reason was

23:39.104 --> 23:40.707
but I'm not worried
about her video.

23:40.707 --> 23:42.877
Okay, thank you.

23:44.581 --> 23:46.017
That wig
situation, crap!

23:46.017 --> 23:48.523
I am feeling unconfident.

23:48.523 --> 23:51.294
I don't know what I did wrong
or what I did right.

23:51.294 --> 23:54.400
<i>Not knowing that you did
anamazing job is a scary
feeling.</i>

23:54.400 --> 23:57.273
I would just hate
to be in the bottom

23:57.273 --> 23:59.779
at this point
in the competition.

23:59.779 --> 24:00.847
Okay, now I just have
to stop thinking about it.

24:00.847 --> 24:02.784
Tati, Tati, Tati.

24:02.784 --> 24:05.724
- Hey. Okay.
- Go big or go home.

24:05.724 --> 24:08.896
- Gotcha,
I ain't going home.
- Drew: <i>Ah-ha!</i>

24:08.896 --> 24:12.303
Three, two, one, rolling.

24:12.303 --> 24:16.244
You're beauty.
You're like a piece of art.

24:16.244 --> 24:19.150
All right, we'd better start
seeing some changes.

24:19.150 --> 24:22.991
Where is the change?
Where is the change?

24:22.991 --> 24:25.563
What are you
thinking in your mind?
What's going on?

24:25.563 --> 24:28.135
Drew:
I don't know if Tatiana
kept it boss this week

24:28.135 --> 24:29.805
<i>It really shows
in the acting department</i>

24:29.805 --> 24:32.110
that she can't
bring it up.

24:32.110 --> 24:34.114
It's always easy
to dial someone down.

24:34.114 --> 24:36.218
It's hard to get
them up to the top.

24:36.218 --> 24:37.754
<i>Remember you have
this dress on.</i>

24:37.754 --> 24:40.092
<i>Show us angles.</i>

24:40.092 --> 24:42.096
So I'm usually a really
put-together person

24:42.096 --> 24:44.066
and I usually can handle
situations very well

24:44.066 --> 24:46.337
<i>and I think that that's
why I don't like acting</i>

24:46.337 --> 24:48.643
is because it just gives me
this anxious feeling

24:48.643 --> 24:50.580
and I can't control it
and I don't know how to be
better than it.

24:50.580 --> 24:54.354
My hair kept getting
in my face.

24:54.354 --> 24:55.288
I tried, I tried,
I tried my hardest.
It just wasn't... my best.

24:56.291 --> 24:58.361
Coryanne.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.036
Three, two, one, rolling.

25:02.036 --> 25:06.178
Drew:
<i>Show us angles.</i>

25:06.178 --> 25:07.681
<i>Give us all
of those things.</i>

25:07.681 --> 25:09.952
What's going on
in your mind?

25:09.952 --> 25:11.589
<i>What's going on with
your make-up?</i>

25:11.589 --> 25:13.760
<i>What's happening here?</i>

25:13.760 --> 25:14.862
Let's see
the wig reveal.

25:14.862 --> 25:17.166
<i>Wig reveal!</i>

25:17.166 --> 25:19.705
<i>Move. Move.
Move.</i>

25:19.705 --> 25:23.211
Cory
literally took the paint

25:23.211 --> 25:26.217
and rubbed it
on her teeth in the video

25:26.217 --> 25:29.390
<i>and I'm not sure
if, like, he wants,</i>

25:29.390 --> 25:32.463
<i>"I'm psychotic,
I'm gonna bite the camera,"</i>

25:32.463 --> 25:34.568
or like,
"I'm going through
a lot of emotions right now

25:34.568 --> 25:38.374
but I'm still beautiful."

25:38.374 --> 25:38.843
Drew:
<i>What's happening
with your hair?</i>

25:41.047 --> 25:43.285
I think Coryanne's pace
got a little weird.

25:43.285 --> 25:45.790
<i>And it became a little bit
like horror movie</i>

25:45.790 --> 25:47.827
but not the fashion
horror movie.

25:49.798 --> 25:50.065
Lord, have mercy.

25:54.407 --> 25:56.578
Woo. I probably
look crazy.

25:56.578 --> 25:57.648
You did a little Carrie
on me here with the red, so...

25:57.648 --> 26:00.754
( growls )

26:00.754 --> 26:02.423
Coryanne:
<i>I can't really be nervous</i>

26:02.423 --> 26:04.828
because I don't know how
the emotion is gonna come off.

26:04.828 --> 26:07.200
<i>The anxiety and the stress
could off really cool
in the video.</i>

26:07.200 --> 26:08.870
It could be really cool or it
could be just awful and ugly.

26:08.870 --> 26:11.842
Did I go most crazy?

26:11.842 --> 26:14.147
- Yes.
- I did too.

26:14.147 --> 26:15.248
All right,
that's a wrap.

26:20.225 --> 26:25.068
Tatiana:
I kept thinking, like,
get as dirty as I can

26:25.068 --> 26:26.772
'cause at the end
it's gonna be like--

26:26.772 --> 26:28.910
You're just gonna look
so dirty,

26:28.910 --> 26:30.446
<i>it's gonna be like
all being taken away.</i>

26:30.446 --> 26:32.283
Coryanne:
Tomorrow is gonna be
really crazy

26:32.283 --> 26:34.120
<i>'cause it could legit
be anyone.</i>

26:34.120 --> 26:35.189
You know what I mean?
It's just, like, you really--

26:35.189 --> 26:35.857
Oh, my gosh.

26:38.930 --> 26:41.068
I am worried that I'm
gonna be in the chopping block.

26:41.068 --> 26:42.871
I mean, I just
know that...

26:42.871 --> 26:45.543
my whole shoot
wasn't that good

26:45.543 --> 26:47.246
and in this competition
you can't really have
much room for errors.

26:47.246 --> 26:49.350
I'm hoping that this shoot
doesn't just make me

26:49.350 --> 26:52.089
look terribly bad
and send me home.

26:52.089 --> 26:54.961
Wow, so much
to think about.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.632
Like, I'm literally
not gonna be able
to sleep for sure.

26:56.632 --> 26:58.468
Coryanne:
I'm always nervous
going into panel.

26:58.468 --> 27:01.207
This week has been so,
like, emotional for me.

27:01.207 --> 27:03.378
I really thought I had it
all together, you know, and so,

27:03.378 --> 27:06.150
<i>at this point, I'm scared
to go home a loser.</i>

27:06.150 --> 27:07.319
It just-- literally
just constant tension.

27:09.992 --> 27:10.425
- So who do you think
it's gonna win?
- Myself.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.373
I really do think
I'm gonna win,
in all honesty.

27:17.373 --> 27:20.445
I'm always a little
nervous for panel.

27:20.445 --> 27:21.649
<i>But I feel confident in my
challenge and the photo
shoot.</i>

27:21.649 --> 27:24.588
And I think--
I think I'm here to stay.

27:24.588 --> 27:27.727
Taking wagers here.

27:27.727 --> 27:28.997
It's getting
down to the wire.

27:28.997 --> 27:30.131
Who do you think
it's going home next?

27:32.336 --> 27:34.240
- Tatiana: <i>I think you
are?</i> - Is it me?

27:34.240 --> 27:35.977
India: <i>This week,
I just feel weird.</i>

27:35.977 --> 27:37.981
I hope that weird feeling
doesn't translate in panel.

27:37.981 --> 27:40.251
<i>I hope my video
turned out great
and I'm happily surprised.</i>

27:40.251 --> 27:42.323
But I'm not gonna come out
saying I did an amazing job

27:42.323 --> 27:43.659
when I'm feeling
unsure about myself.

28:01.261 --> 28:05.703
Rita:
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

28:05.703 --> 28:07.340
This week
was all about acting.

28:07.340 --> 28:10.278
<i>You performed a scene
with Adrienne Moore</i>

28:10.278 --> 28:13.118
from
"Orange is the New Black"

28:13.118 --> 28:14.688
and we pushed you to the extreme
in an emotional video

28:14.688 --> 28:18.663
<i>where you showed
your inner crazy,</i>

28:18.663 --> 28:20.733
going mad
in the name of beauty.

28:20.733 --> 28:23.940
Now, let's say hello
to our amazing judges.

28:23.940 --> 28:26.511
Gorgeous and sexy super model
and body activist Ashley Graham.

28:28.616 --> 28:30.620
Image architect
of the stars Law Roach.

28:33.626 --> 28:33.959
<i>And our incredible
creative consultant,</i>

28:37.333 --> 28:39.070
Chief Creative Officer
at "Paper" magazine,
Drew Elliott.

28:39.070 --> 28:40.539
The winner of "Next Top Model"
will receive $100,000

28:44.480 --> 28:47.320
<i>and be featured
in a commercial,
thanks to Rimmel London.</i>

28:47.320 --> 28:50.893
In addition, the winner
will also be featured

28:50.893 --> 28:54.000
in a fashion spread
for "Paper" magazine.

28:54.000 --> 28:54.868
<i>And get an exclusive one-year
talent deal with VH1.</i>

28:56.973 --> 29:01.214
- You guys ready?
- Yes.

29:01.214 --> 29:02.884
All right.
First up, India.

29:02.884 --> 29:05.990
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:05.990 --> 29:06.658
Let's take a look at your
crazy beautiful video.

29:14.841 --> 29:19.918
Oh, my God.

29:19.918 --> 29:20.786
You didn't think it
was gonna look like
that, did you?

29:20.786 --> 29:23.225
No, wow!

29:23.225 --> 29:24.360
India,
do you know what I love?

29:24.360 --> 29:26.632
You're literally a chameleon.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.034
You are so good at manifesting
into what you need to sell.

29:28.034 --> 29:32.076
And that's so important
in this industry.

29:32.076 --> 29:33.846
I can put you up into anything
and you'll make it work.

29:33.846 --> 29:36.518
- <i>Good job.</i>
- Thank you.

29:36.518 --> 29:37.954
It looked crazy
in the beginning,

29:37.954 --> 29:39.958
<i>yet I can't take
my eyes off of it.</i>

29:39.958 --> 29:41.628
And that's the epitome of
what a model is supposed to do.

29:41.628 --> 29:44.734
I think that
you're listening

29:44.734 --> 29:46.238
and you're taking on
exactly what's happening.

29:46.238 --> 29:49.043
And I see it
in this video.

29:49.043 --> 29:50.713
In any of those challenges,
you often bring 70% of you.

29:50.713 --> 29:54.486
We get great content out of you,
but we could get more.

29:54.486 --> 29:57.661
That's the problem.
If a director sees you

29:57.661 --> 30:00.633
and sees that he could've gotten
more out of you,

30:00.633 --> 30:02.905
that's an issue because
I don't know if you get booked
in that second job.

30:02.905 --> 30:07.146
- Okay.
- Next up. Cody.

30:07.146 --> 30:10.653
I have to jump to in.
This outfit is driving
me crazy.

30:10.653 --> 30:13.892
From here to here
you are super model,

30:13.892 --> 30:15.730
from here to here is
supermarket.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.466
- Ouch.
- Those shoes-- I can't--

30:17.466 --> 30:21.408
- Oh, oh-- oh!
- Ouch.

30:21.408 --> 30:25.249
Please, your shoe choices
drive me crazy

30:25.249 --> 30:27.921
and I've been holding it in
the whole entire season
but today...

30:27.921 --> 30:30.125
- That's okay.
- ...I couldn't help it.

30:30.125 --> 30:31.160
I'd rather you walk
up here barefoot

30:31.160 --> 30:32.931
and just walk like Naomi,

30:32.931 --> 30:34.367
like your shoe broke
or something.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.539
- It's-- I can't.
- Oh, my God, Law!

30:36.539 --> 30:39.678
You thought about it.
We're always looking
at those shoes.

30:39.678 --> 30:40.947
Yeah, I did, I did,
but I didn't think
they were that bad.

30:40.947 --> 30:43.919
- Oh, Jesus.
- Okay.

30:43.919 --> 30:46.625
- Cody so you won
Best Photo last week.
- I did.

30:46.625 --> 30:47.593
- So I'd love to see
if you brought it this week.
- Mm-hmm.

30:56.945 --> 31:01.789
I just wanna say,
thank God for that final pose

31:01.789 --> 31:04.628
because there was moment
where I was like,

31:04.628 --> 31:05.696
"This is really weird." Like,
"What is happening?"

31:05.696 --> 31:08.803
You were giving
white eye shadow

31:08.803 --> 31:11.542
and you put it
in too many places.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.211
- Okay.
- I feel like you came
and you weren't there.

31:13.211 --> 31:15.617
- Uh-huh.
- You were sitting in the chair
and having, I think,

31:15.617 --> 31:19.958
the prettiest make-up
done of the day.

31:19.958 --> 31:22.363
And I said to you,
"Do not put this make-up
all over your face...

31:22.363 --> 31:24.968
- You told her? Whoa.
- ...'cause you will look
hideous." I told everyone.

31:24.968 --> 31:28.141
I think, your final product
is what saves you.

31:28.141 --> 31:30.981
<i>You're gorgeous, I think
you are over thinking it,</i>

31:30.981 --> 31:32.517
overacting, and I think
that if you would've actually
thought less about it,

31:32.517 --> 31:36.525
and thought,
"Pretty, pretty, pretty,"

31:36.525 --> 31:38.428
it wouldn't gotten
to that...

31:38.428 --> 31:39.497
<i>part that I felt
a little uncomfortable.</i>

31:39.497 --> 31:42.503
But you're down
to the final five,

31:42.503 --> 31:44.407
like, these are the
mistakes you should not be
making.

31:44.407 --> 31:45.341
If Drew tells you,
"Don't smear the make-up
into your face," listen.

31:46.310 --> 31:51.254
Thank you.
So, Courtney,

31:51.254 --> 31:53.559
I wanna know if you were able
to take yesterday's challenge

31:53.559 --> 31:54.493
and apply it to the crazy video
we're about to watch.

32:03.445 --> 32:08.221
I felt like it was
a little overacted.

32:08.221 --> 32:11.093
<i>Final imagine
isn't so great,</i>

32:11.093 --> 32:12.630
<i>I think you look
a little older in it.</i>

32:12.630 --> 32:14.701
Usually I'm like...
( panting )

32:14.701 --> 32:17.439
...salivating over like,
everything you're doing.

32:17.439 --> 32:19.711
This is the first week
that I feel that I feel
a bit little disappointed.

32:19.711 --> 32:22.584
I think as far as the beauty,
I think there are

32:22.584 --> 32:24.353
some really amazing segments
of beauty in that.

32:24.353 --> 32:27.594
<i>And also,
it wasn't scary</i>

32:27.594 --> 32:29.932
which a lot of people
went to the scary side.

32:29.932 --> 32:32.036
<i>You didn't go
to the scary side,</i>

32:32.036 --> 32:34.239
you went to a little bit
of the wild side, which--
I love that.

32:34.239 --> 32:37.046
In the challenge, you look like
an actress Hollywood superstar
on that stage.

32:37.046 --> 32:41.153
<i>Now you look like you're
representing a hair brand</i>

32:41.153 --> 32:43.726
or a make-up line
and I love how you can adapt
into other characters.

32:43.726 --> 32:46.932
- That's such a strong
quality to have. Good job. -
Thank you.

32:46.932 --> 32:50.071
Rita:
<i>Thank you.</i>

32:50.071 --> 32:52.476
<i>Coryanne.</i>

32:52.476 --> 32:54.714
How do you think
this week went for you?

32:54.714 --> 32:57.219
- So acting for me is
kinda an emotional thing.
- Yeah.

32:57.219 --> 33:00.893
It's hard for me to let everyone
see, like, my vulnerable side.

33:00.893 --> 33:04.233
But I actually really,
really enjoyed the challenge,
more than I thought.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.603
Let's see if you brought
that emotion to the crazy
beautiful video.

33:15.590 --> 33:20.499
I'm not a fan
of this video.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.436
While we were doing it
I kept yelling at you,

33:22.436 --> 33:25.141
"It's still a beauty video,"

33:25.141 --> 33:26.310
because I thought
you were taking it to a place
that it shouldn't have been.

33:26.310 --> 33:30.853
I wanted it to be gorgeous

33:30.853 --> 33:32.824
and it was the first time,
I have to tell you,

33:32.824 --> 33:34.862
that I didn't think
you looked beautiful.

33:34.862 --> 33:35.863
I disagree. I thought
you looked gorgeous.

33:38.769 --> 33:40.940
<i>I think this picture
is very European hooker.</i>

33:40.940 --> 33:43.512
Gorgeous.
Gorgeous.

33:43.512 --> 33:45.516
Ashley:
<i>I see the potential.</i>

33:45.516 --> 33:46.886
I felt that you
have an advantage over
the other girls

33:46.886 --> 33:50.025
<i>in a way because
of your mother,</i>

33:50.025 --> 33:51.661
<i>because of you how
you were raised,</i>

33:51.661 --> 33:53.965
but there is still
so much missing.

33:53.965 --> 33:56.471
Rita:
I just wanted to know
what that emotion was

33:56.471 --> 33:58.809
<i>that you tapped into.</i>

33:58.809 --> 34:02.015
My mom-- she was like
a super hero for me.

34:02.015 --> 34:04.621
You know what I mean,
you idealize the parent
you don't grow up with.

34:04.621 --> 34:07.660
<i>And so I was just excited
to see her in the summers</i>

34:07.660 --> 34:09.564
and then when
I moved to America,

34:09.564 --> 34:11.367
I thought we were gonna be
best friends.

34:11.367 --> 34:13.872
and we were strangers.

34:13.872 --> 34:15.408
Now it's the closest we've been
<i>'cause she's staying with
me</i>

34:15.408 --> 34:18.414
and I love having
her around.

34:18.414 --> 34:20.820
I'm always like,
"Oh, I'm so thankful
that we are finally close."

34:20.820 --> 34:25.663
- ( crying )
- You're so emotional
right now, what is it about?

34:25.663 --> 34:28.936
I feel like it was my fault
that I wasn't there more

34:28.936 --> 34:32.476
and I didn't notice
that there was problems

34:32.476 --> 34:34.982
and that she wasn't okay.

34:34.982 --> 34:35.348
- This is crazy. Hold on.
- ( crying )

34:37.353 --> 34:39.590
Come here.

34:41.828 --> 34:42.897
What are you saying?
I didn't even know
that about you.

34:42.897 --> 34:45.569
This is crazy.

34:45.569 --> 34:49.043
It's crazy.

34:49.043 --> 34:51.782
Listen to me.
This is what
you're gonna use

34:51.782 --> 34:53.886
to win and this is
what's gonna make
you and break you.

34:53.886 --> 34:58.128
Don't let it break you.

34:58.128 --> 35:01.201
Everyone has
a story, girl.

35:01.201 --> 35:02.268
This is just yours, so
let's wipe this 'cause we don't
want that quivering lip.

35:02.903 --> 35:07.012
Give me a pose.

35:07.012 --> 35:08.347
Give me a model.

35:08.347 --> 35:10.418
Give me Coryanne.
( laughing )

35:10.418 --> 35:12.957
- <i>Okay? All right.</i>
- Yes.

35:12.957 --> 35:13.859
Up next, Tatiana.

35:23.311 --> 35:27.653
I didn't like it.
The emotion of it was good,

35:27.653 --> 35:30.492
I think the acting was great,

35:30.492 --> 35:31.896
but I don't think
you looked pretty.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.732
You know, you look great,
standing here.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.569
Momma, you're always coming,
you're always...

35:35.569 --> 35:37.439
turn this on the--
on the runway,

35:37.439 --> 35:40.412
but I'm starting
to really question it,

35:40.412 --> 35:42.449
and I don't want
to sound harsh at all--

35:42.449 --> 35:43.919
I'm really starting
to question your face.

35:43.919 --> 35:45.756
Do you have the face that
can really sell anything?

35:45.756 --> 35:49.263
I agree with Law, you
aren't that pretty in this
video.

35:49.263 --> 35:52.469
<i>I don't think that
youunderstand editorialfor
yourself yet</i>

35:52.469 --> 35:55.576
You're gonna
be given weird looks.

35:55.576 --> 35:57.914
You're gonna be
givenweird make up

35:57.914 --> 35:59.483
and you're gonna have to figure
out how to make it beautiful.

35:59.483 --> 36:01.588
And you didn't figure it out
in this video.

36:01.588 --> 36:03.424
<i>This is where you have
to put in the work.</i>

36:03.424 --> 36:05.529
Get the strange magazines
and look through them.

36:05.529 --> 36:09.604
Because that
is how you practice.

36:09.604 --> 36:12.276
Do what they do
in the mirror.

36:12.276 --> 36:14.246
<i>I don't wanna see you get
kicked out of this
competition</i>

36:14.246 --> 36:16.284
because you don't know
how to do the high-end weird
editorial stuff.

36:16.284 --> 36:20.425
I think that's what I'm really
struggling with, to be honest,

36:20.425 --> 36:22.931
because I complained about
the make-up before
because I felt like,

36:22.931 --> 36:25.102
"Okay, this isn't flattering
on my face, like, this isn't
flattering to me."

36:25.102 --> 36:28.274
You didn't say anything
to me that you didn't like
the make-up.

36:28.274 --> 36:30.980
<i>You didn't come
to talk to me.</i>

36:30.980 --> 36:33.718
I would've helped you.

36:33.718 --> 36:35.288
<i>I think also you know
what's right for you.</i>

36:35.288 --> 36:37.493
But what we are doing
here is not the

36:37.493 --> 36:38.629
"Tatiana, what's right
for you?" show, right?

36:38.629 --> 36:42.637
<i>We are doing a series</i>

36:42.637 --> 36:44.707
of amazing lessons
from world-class teachers

36:44.707 --> 36:46.611
who are here to train you into
being an industry top model

36:48.181 --> 36:52.957
because right now
you are not.

36:52.957 --> 36:55.295
- Okay. Thank you.
- Tatiana, thank you so much.

36:55.295 --> 36:57.499
Ladies, we are down
to the final five,

37:00.037 --> 37:03.410
and this is getting tougher
meaning, stumbling,

37:03.410 --> 37:07.653
<i>non-consistency
is a no-no.</i>

37:07.653 --> 37:10.893
With that in mind, we are now
gonna deliberate your videos

37:10.893 --> 37:14.835
<i>and decide who is staying</i>

37:14.835 --> 37:15.602
and who is packing their bags
and leaving tonight.

37:37.445 --> 37:42.122
Rita:
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>

37:42.122 --> 37:42.723
Tonight, we're gonna be down
to the final four.

37:44.761 --> 37:45.729
<i>At this point
in the competition,</i>

37:49.637 --> 37:51.240
you should be taking
what you've learned

37:51.240 --> 37:52.576
and deliver
stellar performances.

37:54.112 --> 37:56.250
<i>From here on out,
we expect you all</i>

37:58.622 --> 38:02.730
to put your best
face forward.

38:02.730 --> 38:05.803
<i>The first name
I'm gonna call,</i>

38:05.803 --> 38:06.538
who wins best video
this week is...

38:09.778 --> 38:14.452
India.

38:14.452 --> 38:15.288
- <i>Congratulations.</i>
- Thank you.

38:23.638 --> 38:27.445
The second name
I'm gonna call...

38:28.883 --> 38:28.949
Courtney.

38:32.957 --> 38:33.592
Congratulations.

38:42.442 --> 38:46.752
Two spaces left.

38:46.752 --> 38:47.820
Coryanne.

38:51.828 --> 38:55.334
Will Tatiana and Cody
please step forward?

39:00.812 --> 39:05.455
Cody, winning
Best Photo last week,

39:05.455 --> 39:08.996
you raised
the bar for yourself.

39:08.996 --> 39:11.267
But what the judges need
to see from you is consistency.

39:11.267 --> 39:15.776
You should be taking
in everything we say,

39:15.776 --> 39:17.378
but your ups and downs
tell us you might be lost.

39:19.383 --> 39:20.284
Tatiana, for weeks
we sang your praises,

39:24.193 --> 39:27.900
convinced you
were the model to beat.

39:27.900 --> 39:31.106
But when pushedbeyond
your comfort zone,

39:31.106 --> 39:33.211
you seemed to fall apart.

39:33.211 --> 39:35.783
A boss always delivers.

39:35.783 --> 39:37.853
So...

39:39.322 --> 39:39.857
who's going to stay?

39:46.003 --> 39:50.545
<i>Tatiana.</i>

39:50.545 --> 39:50.879
- Congratulations.
- Oh, my God.

39:54.219 --> 39:55.990
Rita:
<i>You've made it another week
and you have the chance</i>

39:55.990 --> 39:57.894
to still become
America's next top model.

39:57.894 --> 40:00.231
Go join the other girls.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.169
- Cody.
- Hey.

40:02.169 --> 40:04.372
- Cody.
- Thank you so much.

40:04.372 --> 40:04.974
You are the one who has
transformed the most
from the start to now.

40:06.377 --> 40:10.886
- Say bye to the judges
- Bye, you guys.

40:10.886 --> 40:13.424
Thank you,
thank you so much.

40:13.424 --> 40:14.861
And Law, yes,
I'm gonna let you

40:14.861 --> 40:16.496
do whatever
you want with these.

40:16.496 --> 40:17.900
Sweetheart, not the
shoesthat sent you home.

40:17.900 --> 40:19.604
- Here, you can have them.
- ( all laughing )

40:19.604 --> 40:21.340
Thank you.

40:21.340 --> 40:24.079
We love you, Cody.

40:24.079 --> 40:25.916
Cody:
I feel like everything
happens for a reason,

40:25.916 --> 40:27.352
<i>and I'm just still
so honored and so blessed</i>

40:27.352 --> 40:30.626
<i>to have been here</i>

40:30.626 --> 40:32.596
<i>I've been told
"no" a lot.</i>

40:32.596 --> 40:33.765
<i>To have made it
this far on the competition</i>

40:33.765 --> 40:36.738
<i>is just such
a feat for me.</i>

40:36.738 --> 40:38.374
<i>This really is
just the beginning.
I'm very proud of myself.</i>

40:38.374 --> 40:41.279
Top five is huge.

40:43.451 --> 40:46.257
( crying )
I definitely respect
their decision.

40:46.257 --> 40:48.293
But I feel like
I definitely gave my all.

40:56.944 --> 41:01.654
To showcase the
London look,

41:01.654 --> 41:03.592
you'll be doing
each other's make-up.

41:03.592 --> 41:04.561
Courtney: <i>I'm gonna
use the lipstick.</i>

41:04.561 --> 41:06.731
Does that stay on?

41:06.731 --> 41:08.000
I would say drink
through a straw.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.436
Woo, like, not how
you should answer.

41:09.436 --> 41:12.643
- What?
- Come on.

41:12.643 --> 41:14.981
- What is it?
- ( screaming )

41:14.981 --> 41:17.319
We're shooting that
Rimmel London commercial today.

41:17.319 --> 41:21.260
- Director: <i>Action!</i>
- Models work their
entire career

41:21.260 --> 41:23.599
for a national
make-up commercial.
It's a lot of pressure.

41:23.599 --> 41:25.401
Today's decision is gonna
be the toughest one yet.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.854
Woman:
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
