00:04.538 --> 00:06.538
Janet, small pack, king size.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.540
Mmm-hmm.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.375
- For who?
- Ashley.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.510
Hello, Ashley. How are you?

00:11.512 --> 00:12.512
Good, Mr. Kim.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.767
- But...
- She is buying for her mummy.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.749
- I have a note.
- See?

00:17.284 --> 00:18.650
Graydon, king size.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.254
What you think, huh?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.256
She just smoke?

00:23.591 --> 00:25.424
Ashley mummy have a bad back.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.592
She can't come to store.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.660
Ashley is good girl.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.163
Doing what her parent ask.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.165
Okay.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.366
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

00:36.771 --> 00:38.137
And for you, Ashley,

00:38.506 --> 00:41.407
One lollipop
because you is help you mummy.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.409
Thank you.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.249
Sorry,
what was your mum's name?

00:50.251 --> 00:51.316
Brittney. I mean Alice.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.253
Are you sure?

00:57.558 --> 00:59.525
Sorry, Mr. Kim.
Brittney made me!

01:01.529 --> 01:03.095
Oh, and I can't work tomorrow.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.396
I have a note from my mom.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.767
Pfft.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.791
So... How is Ada family doing?

01:32.793 --> 01:35.260
Settling in, slowly.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.529
So hard when you
first come to Canada.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.232
Can't speak English,
don't know anybody...

01:40.234 --> 01:41.266
I know.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.508
And everyone
keeps telling them,

01:43.370 --> 01:45.210
"go, leafs, go!"
now they think
it's a greeting.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.506
Sorry we don't
have more donation.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.174
No, this is more than enough.
Thank you.

01:49.176 --> 01:52.311
Janet just move out,
business not so good...

01:52.313 --> 01:54.179
Think of the picture detail
watching <i>top chef!</i>

01:54.181 --> 01:55.247
What you talking?

01:55.249 --> 01:56.949
Big screen blue jays.

01:56.951 --> 02:01.286
In UHD, HDR, LED, OMG...

02:01.522 --> 02:03.589
Oh. This is nice.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.891
Enjoy your new TV.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.159
Oh, we will.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.227
Okay, bye.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.362
What's this?

02:10.364 --> 02:12.664
Forty inches of
the highest definition.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.666
Definition of what?
Waste of money?

02:14.668 --> 02:16.201
Do you know how
many 'k' this TV have?

02:16.203 --> 02:17.236
Four!

02:17.238 --> 02:20.672
What happen to "talk about"
before you
spending so much money?

02:20.674 --> 02:21.874
Now pastor Nina think...

02:22.977 --> 02:26.245
And we could make
more donation to
new immigrant family.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.347
- What about
old immigrant family?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.450
Think about
Korean drama in HDR.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.557
If you need a place
to store the TV
until this all blows over,

02:38.559 --> 02:41.960
I know ginger
would love to watch
her bird program in HD.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.263
You know
dog is color blind, huh?

02:51.438 --> 02:52.905
- Where have you been?
- Deli.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.439
- Whiff on this.
- Ugh.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.875
Lauren's coming over tonight.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.745
I'm doing one of those
fancy cold cut boards.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.514
You know, a little wine,
pigs in a blanket,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.750
And some cozy time
with this guy.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.752
Ah.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.954
Whoo! I sampled
a lot of pastrami.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.596
Well, I look forward
to meeting this girl.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.659
Yeah, about that.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.695
I was kind of hoping
you might not
come home tonight.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.831
No offense but
it's a little early for her
to get Junged.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.301
- What does that mean?
- You know how it is.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.002
Girls thinks I'm nice or funny

03:24.004 --> 03:25.737
Then she meets you
and can't remember my name.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.739
What?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.542
Last week, beer fest,

03:30.544 --> 03:33.378
A girl was literally
in the middle
of giving me her number

03:33.380 --> 03:34.446
When you came over.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.448
I never got those
last two digits.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.317
I've been trying
different combos all week.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.551
Man, that was one time.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.755
It happened at rib fest,
raptors fan zone,
that uberpool.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.924
- Oh, yeah.
- It happens all the time.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.294
So you're
staying away tonight.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.598
Fine. I gotta study anyway.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.832
I'll be at the library.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.914
Some cute girls there, too.

03:55.769 --> 03:56.835
Go nuts.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.437
Nerds.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.841
Santi:
Sometimes it is sculptural.

04:02.843 --> 04:03.942
Sometimes it is figurative.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.311
In this particular series,

04:07.748 --> 04:10.282
I work with each of the models
to reveal the essence
of who they really are.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.783
Okay.
This isn't essence.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.952
It's cliche.
It's one kind of beauty.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.388
Yeah, the beautiful kind.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.357
It's boring
and it's commercial.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.458
They're all the same.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.327
There's comfort
in this incredibly
attractive sameness.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.896
- How are you not seeing this?
- Janet?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.899
Do you have an opinion you'd
like to share with our guest?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.369
I'm good. Thanks.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.371
Gerald?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.305
We think the work is sexist.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.308
Personally, in a great way.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.876
- I didn't say that.
- No, you're right.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.479
You said it was more cliche
and lacking in range.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.015
Though, again,
I find it to be
a very attractive range.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.817
Okay, it perpetuates
what people expect.

04:46.287 --> 04:49.821
Why not show
a wider range of shape, color,

04:49.823 --> 04:52.124
And I don't know,
hairiness, limb count.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.126
Santi if I may.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.454
I draw great inspiration
from my models.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.796
What inspires you?

04:59.033 --> 05:00.098
Um...

05:00.834 --> 05:02.467
- Well, people.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.902
Particularly women.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.304
Vulnerability...

05:06.273 --> 05:07.993
Because when I
look at my work,
I see people.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.741
Particularly women.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.978
And vulnerability.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.846
You just repeated what I said.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.648
Okay. Thanks, Janet.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.451
But some of us have
a blowout appointment
in about half an hour,

05:19.453 --> 05:20.752
So we're going to
wrap this thing up.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.655
Okay?
Thank you so much for coming.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.956
- Really beautiful.
- My absolute pleasure.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.998
- I'm a huge fan.
- That's a great shot.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.699
I have a donation
for Ada family.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.834
- I hope I'm not too late.
- No, it's perfect.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.737
We're actually
taking a load over to
their place later today.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.105
Now they have new TV.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.973
You're giving them
your new TV?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.075
New to them.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.844
Oh.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.978
Did the Ada family
get the fridge

05:46.980 --> 05:48.880
And prepared meals
I ordered them?

05:48.882 --> 05:51.116
Yes,
- you already asked me that.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.451
I get mixed up.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.386
We make so many
different donations.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.488
Well, unfortunately
the Ada's are vegetarian

05:56.490 --> 05:58.290
So they really can't
eat the meals you bought.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.758
Oh.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.960
It's okay,
I make them bibimbap.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.028
Oh.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.863
Bibimbap. That sounds fun.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.065
- Am I saying it right?
- No.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.137
- Hey, I'm heading out.
- Oh...

06:12.139 --> 06:13.538
Jelly!

06:14.842 --> 06:16.408
That was gonna be me,
but a big ol' pile of work
gobbled up my desk.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.376
Hope it doesn't
gobble up your chair.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.479
Yeah, better spray my office
with work-icide.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.383
So more work
doesn't destroy
my furniture crops.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.720
All right. How I can help?

06:28.721 --> 06:30.533
Oh, my god,
I was secretly hoping
you'd say that.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.957
Your secrets are safe with me.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.892
Well, here's another one.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.014
I'm trying to get out of here
so I can meet Alejandro.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.929
Yeah.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.131
Let me help you do that.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.247
Well, it'd probably be best
if we divide and conquer.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.603
I'll finish this paperwork,
if you clean
the two cars that came in.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.073
Full disclosure,
the impala has baby urp
all over the back seat.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.641
Okay, I don't
really know what urp is,

06:49.643 --> 06:51.743
But I'm guessing
it's not the name of the baby.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.745
Thank you!

06:53.747 --> 06:55.113
- Excuse me. Janet.
- Yes?

06:55.682 --> 06:57.516
- I said Janet.
- Sorry.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.484
Sometimes I hear the "Ja"
and jump right to...

07:00.454 --> 07:01.520
Gerald.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.622
Hi, I'm Gerald.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.525
Big fan.

07:06.526 --> 07:07.559
So, Janet, I'm sorry
we didn't finish earlier.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.727
I wanted to thank you.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.761
Oh?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.631
I hear what you're saying
about our modern sense
of beauty.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.167
I think you'd be great
for my next shoot.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.436
- Really?
- Really?

07:18.172 --> 07:19.771
It'll be
- a great collaboration.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.906
Okay.

07:20.908 --> 07:21.908
Wow.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.910
I didn't think
I was exactly the type.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.579
It's not really something
I've done before.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.221
Oh, don't worry.
You'll be perfect for it.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.450
- Okay.
- Great.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.986
I do some modeling too
by the way.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.962
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry,
I had to work late.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.697
- I'll be out in 10 minutes.
- Lauren's on her way up.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.265
- Get out.
- I have to shower.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.734
- I smell like baby barf.
- That's adorable.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.070
Just make that work for you
with your library geeks.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.580
- Hey, come through.
- Hey.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.647
Right through.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.683
In fact,
I was thinking we could

08:04.685 --> 08:07.452
Spend the next 10 minutes
or so out on the balcony.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.187
I just came from outside.
I could use some ac.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.189
Oh, right.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.692
So what can I get for you
to go with my mortadella?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.861
- Uh, white wine.
- Ooh. Just in luck.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.229
- Bought a big box.
- Ooh.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.234
Oh. Hi.

08:22.236 --> 08:23.268
- I'm...
- -My roommate, Jung.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.769
Who was just leaving.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.605
Uh, well,
I have to get dressed first.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.772
But, it was nice to meet you.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.274
You, too. I'm Lauren.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.710
- What is that?
- oh, it's pepperettes.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.144
I'm doing a bit
of a meat board.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.846
- No, involio?
- Yeah.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.615
- It's their Shea body butter.
- Of course, it is.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.617
I love that stuff.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.851
Well, I'm gonna get changed.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.013
- I'll see you later.
- Great.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.155
Well, Jung seems nice.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.857
Does he always
walk around half naked?

08:45.859 --> 08:48.126
Ah, I prefer to think of him
as half-dressed.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.729
Ham and cheese, or broccoli.

08:50.731 --> 08:51.731
And cheese.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.234
<i>Yobo.</i> Sit.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.640
Look.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.174
Your favorite movie.

09:04.578 --> 09:05.744
Your favorite snack.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.713
No more angry face?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.917
You just so crazy
with money sometime.

09:11.919 --> 09:12.851
I not crazy.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.587
You buy 100 bag of salt
during ice storm.

09:15.589 --> 09:16.821
And we not have to buy since.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.591
Okay.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.760
Next time we talk about first.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.128
Thank you.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.796
So, we keep new TV?

09:25.566 --> 09:26.665
Yeah.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.669
I already give old TV
to Ada family.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.205
- What?
- Yeah, it's good to give.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.775
- Why you do that?
- It's just old TV.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.976
What's you problem?

09:37.978 --> 09:39.010
You remember y2k?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.812
What you do?

09:40.814 --> 09:46.017
We so scared
everything go crazy,
I hide $3,000 in safe place.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.752
Where?

09:47.754 --> 09:48.954
Inside old TV.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.223
- Why you do that?
- Y2k.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.136
Why you looking at porno?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.172
It's a fashion magazine.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.840
Oh. Oh...

10:08.976 --> 10:10.909
Yeah, she's very beautiful.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.411
Need more clothes on,
but very beautiful.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.848
I'm actually modeling
for a pretty important
photographer at school.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.817
- You?
- Why'd you say it like that?

10:18.819 --> 10:21.052
Janet, you are pretty,
but not model pretty.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.222
Ah. You like this.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.759
That's an ad for eyeglasses
and you're pointing
at the doctor.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.927
Janet.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.996
You is most beautiful girl.

10:31.932 --> 10:32.998
To family.

10:33.867 --> 10:38.169
She is most beautiful girl
to everyone else.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.940
See, this is why I'm doing it.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.476
- To take down this
patriarchal view of...
- Okay, we going.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.311
- See you.
- Bye, Janet.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.412
Of beauty!

10:56.256 --> 10:58.790
- So, Lauren seemed cool.
- Here we go.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.325
I was just asking
if you had a good
time last night.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.960
I don't know, did I,
Mr. Wet chest?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.461
I wasn't done toweling.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.963
She barely noticed
my meat board.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.365
Too busy thinking about yours.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.034
What do you want me to do?
Smell bad?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.268
Drool? Be a jerk?

11:10.270 --> 11:12.704
I don't know, man.
But she's coming over.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.706
Why do you think that is?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.709
- Fine. I'll just leave.
- No.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.780
No, you're staying
and you're gonna
make me look amazing.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.016
- You want me
to do your hair again?
- No.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.418
Yes. But that's not all.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.026
Hello!

11:35.228 --> 11:36.394
Please, come in.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.500
Wow. So big family.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.902
Thank you.

11:47.507 --> 11:50.108
- This is bibimbap.
- I'm Nisha.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.178
I put in fridge for you.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.380
Yeah.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.184
Mrs. Kim.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.820
Oh. Pastor Nina!

12:01.822 --> 12:03.788
- You are too generous.
- It's nothing.

12:03.790 --> 12:04.923
Just cooking.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.524
Oh. Pastor Nina. Hi.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.959
And Mr. Kim.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.127
Ooh, this is great.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.396
The Ada's know almost no one.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.797
I mean, yes,
donations are nice.

12:12.799 --> 12:16.234
I would kill for that juicer
but they don't have
any social network.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.235
Okay.

12:17.237 --> 12:21.906
Mr. Ada, the Kim's
own a very successful
convenience store.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.209
It's just a store.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.344
Mr. Ada ran a pharmacy.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.246
Maybe you could tell them
how you got started.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.050
It's a so long
time ago story...

12:32.052 --> 12:33.852
You having trouble with TV?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.820
- Maybe I can fix.
- No, appa. Just leave.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.289
- We should go.
- Please, stay.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.660
Have tea.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.439
I was just telling the Ada's
about sugar bushes.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.497
They're very excited
to see them.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.198
Of course,
- it's not the season.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.100
Okay, I just do very fast fix.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.137
Is everything okay?

12:52.506 --> 12:54.506
Yeah. I just have to fix...

12:55.175 --> 12:56.274
In a bathroom.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.229
Everything okay?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.231
Uh-huh.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.870
It's a home tan.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.438
Is it terrible? Don't tell me.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.974
Stop looking at it.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.010
Okay, tell me.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.914
No, no, it looks...
You look really fun and stuff.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.415
I also did some waxing.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.583
Which actually went okay.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.851
Great.

13:41.121 --> 13:41.870
Why?

13:41.871 --> 13:43.191
For the shoot tonight,
with Santi.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.358
I'm just getting camera-ready.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.392
Right, 'cause you're trying
to look different
from the other models.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.160
I already am different.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.995
I'm just trying
to make
my different look good.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.598
Well, it... It... It... It...

13:54.501 --> 13:56.167
I know it's not perfect.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.404
- But this is who I am.
- Not really.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.872
And I'm still making my point

14:00.874 --> 14:02.974
About beauty standards
and what they do to a person.

14:02.976 --> 14:03.976
Definitely.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.145
So, you're still
going through with this?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.179
Yes, Gerald. I am.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.415
Just need one more shower.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.152
Hey.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.353
Hey.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.389
Hey. I mean...

14:21.528 --> 14:22.594
Thanks.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.964
So, I checked out that podcast
you recommended.

14:28.301 --> 14:28.750
You're right. It's terrible.

14:28.751 --> 14:29.200
Did you listen
all the way to the end?
It only gets worse.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.703
I know. So good.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.042
So it's muggy outside.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.345
- Jung, you look super-hot.
- No, I don't.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.513
I'm gross.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.548
Oily skin.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.550
It's gross, right?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.517
It doesn't look oily to me.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.953
Yeah, it's more of
a sweat situation.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.555
And it's out of control.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.523
Yeah, I sweat, like, a lot.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.292
Mostly in the pits.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.694
And the groin.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.464
I just meant
you must be super-hot
with all those clothes on.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.374
Oh! Sorry, I should've
brought you a latte.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.376
No, you shouldn't have.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.611
Because Jung can't have dairy.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.047
It upsets my stomach.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.317
Yeah, full on heavy d.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.154
Diarrhea.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.228
I'm not super technical

15:30.230 --> 15:32.397
But is there a reason
he's fixing it
in the bathroom?

15:33.333 --> 15:35.166
More private.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.435
He get nervous
when he's fixing.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.404
I go check.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.276
I usually
just take a magazine.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.545
- More tea?
- Okay.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.725
Why you take too long?

16:00.727 --> 16:01.993
Envelope get stuck.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.155
Have to take out other thing.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.463
Everybody think you is crazy.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.299
Not crazy now. Huh?

16:14.507 --> 16:15.573
He almost finish.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.078
Maybe we could play a game.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.015
So it must have been hard
to find work.

16:24.617 --> 16:28.086
Yeah, that's 'cause
he's lazy and mostly mooches.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.253
Right, buddy?

16:29.255 --> 16:31.723
Yeah, I mean,
why pay for stuff
when other people can, right?

16:32.659 --> 16:35.159
But, I mean,
you have a good job
at handy now?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.428
- Yeah...
- -But he's on thin ice.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.430
Because of his weird fetish.

16:40.266 --> 16:43.234
Okay, you know what, I'm done.
All right. You said be gross.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.103
I said that's impossible,
yet I did it.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.105
- Now you're crossing the line.
- Hey!

16:47.107 --> 16:49.307
- Cover your shoulders.
- Sorry.
What's going on?

16:50.777 --> 16:51.777
Look.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.252
- I can't help it
if she's into me.
- Fine.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.647
- Jung's the hot one
so go for it.
- What?

16:58.284 --> 16:59.650
I'm clean. I cooked.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.220
I loved that story about
your great-grandmother
who was suffering...

17:02.222 --> 17:03.688
- She was a suffragette.
- Whatever.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.457
The point is you're gonna
fall for the guy with the abs

17:06.459 --> 17:08.292
And let the guy
with personality get away.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.360
Law of the jungle.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.795
You think
I'd drop a guy I like

17:10.797 --> 17:13.231
Because a slightly
more handsome guy
is in the room?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.365
- Slightly?
- You heard her.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.501
No, I've been on 11 dates
this month.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.336
It's exhausting
and it's boring.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.472
I just wanted
a nice, cool guy,
and I thought I had one.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.607
Who are you talking about?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.076
Why are guys such jerks?

17:31.017 --> 17:32.617
Oh, my god.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.453
She didn't like you!

17:35.455 --> 17:36.687
She liked me!

17:36.689 --> 17:38.689
Yeah, and now she hates you.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.758
Bittersweet victory.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.568
Thanks for coming.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.270
Hey, moral support, right?

17:52.272 --> 17:53.371
Is that why
you brought your portfolio?

17:53.373 --> 17:55.813
I couldn't find my wallet,
so I just thought
I'd bring it along

17:56.276 --> 17:56.674
To carry
some of my loose change

17:56.676 --> 17:57.809
And a few
of my better pictures.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.243
Okay,
you are not harassing Santi.

17:59.813 --> 18:00.893
Can I just show him my hat?

18:01.347 --> 18:02.547
Hey, Janet.
You made it.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.249
What happened to you?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.051
Yeah, there was an incident,

18:07.053 --> 18:09.787
And my skin's a little orange,
and my eyebrows
are over-plucked.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.089
But I said screw it.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.257
I'm a real person.
It doesn't matter
what I look like.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.392
I completely agree with you.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.694
I wasn't sure what to wear,

18:17.864 --> 18:19.764
So I brought
some different outfits
including some swimsuits.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.832
Oh... Okay.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.568
But meanwhile,
can you adjust the umbrella

18:23.570 --> 18:25.703
And also put a sandbag
on that soft box for me?

18:26.272 --> 18:27.672
Oh. Okay.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.073
- And hair and makeup?
- Yep.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.109
Talent is all processed
and ready to go.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.411
There she is. Hey, come on in.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.216
She's 31.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.551
Like you said,
need to push boundaries.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.553
Cool.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.388
I still think I made my point.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.630
- Janet, bounce.
- Right.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.427
Great lo-kaysh, by the way.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.296
- It's kind of a closed set.
- Gotcha, outside.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.568
- Peace.
- Two.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.570
Two words.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.905
- Cut off hand.
- First word.

19:00.907 --> 19:01.739
No, that's up here.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.541
When it's on
the arm it's syllables.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.410
- Okay. All done.
- Oh, thank god.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.419
<i>Yobo,</i> let's go.

19:15.421 --> 19:17.822
Okay, good to meet you all.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.524
Bye-bye.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.626
Thank you for coming
and fixing TV.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.464
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.299
Go, leafs, go.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.235
Oh, you very welcome.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.275
And here take this.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.543
- What is it?
- What you doing?

19:38.912 --> 19:40.211
For church.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.914
And for helping
other people like Ada family.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.849
Oh, wow! That's very generous.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.317
Yeah, too generous.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.518
You see their fridge?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.453
Maybe you need some time
to think about it.

19:49.455 --> 19:54.458
Yeah, remember,
it's good to talk about
a big money decision. Huh?

19:54.727 --> 19:55.860
Why not give?

19:56.763 --> 19:58.529
We don't even remember
money is in back of TV.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.830
I remember.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.566
Just take long time.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.700
It was in the TV?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.336
Yeah, for safe keeping.

20:05.872 --> 20:06.938
Y2k.

20:07.473 --> 20:08.839
Should we keep money
in our TV?

20:08.841 --> 20:10.575
No. No, the banks
are good here.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.243
Please.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.945
This is what I want to do.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.682
Okay.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.750
- We go now?
- Yeah.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.326
Maybe we'll try pictionary
this time.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.000
So, how was photo shoot?

20:36.402 --> 20:37.969
Have to show me
picture of you.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.503
I was actually
behind the camera.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.905
You taking model picture?

20:40.907 --> 20:42.974
Well, the photographer
was taking
the model's picture.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.775
I was behind the photographer.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.777
Well, around.
I was holding the bounce.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.912
It's a lighting thing.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.514
- So you bounce light?
- Yeah, not easy.

20:50.516 --> 20:51.516
Sound easy.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.687
What are you doing?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.889
Have to make up
for umma spending.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.925
Not spending, giving.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.660
Appa, you can't still
be worried about y2k.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.728
Not y2k.

21:04.564 --> 21:07.565
But maybe asteroid,
Ebola, robot uprising.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.034
How will you know
any of that stuff's happening
if you don't have a TV?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.036
Hmm.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.637
Okay.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.639
