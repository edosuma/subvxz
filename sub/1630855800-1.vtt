of the apple in his head

- All right then, Mr. Super Spy,

24:31.774 --> 24:33.384
what am I thinking right now?

24:42.219 --> 24:45.919
- How do I get rid of this
devilishly handsome stranger?

24:47.921 --> 24:48.965
- You're half right.

24:50.184 --> 24:51.054
- Which half?

24:52.839 --> 24:54.275
- Not the one you
were hoping for.

24:57.278 --> 24:59.410
- The chip is a prototype.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.238
It's a work in progress.

25:01.282 --> 25:02.370
- Maybe they should
have perfected it

25:02.413 --> 25:04.938
before they implanted
it in your head.

25:04.981 --> 25:09.116
- They tried, there was a
version of the chip before mine.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.553
- Did it cause the owner to
crash and burn with the ladies

25:11.597 --> 25:13.163
as badly as yours?

25:13.207 --> 25:16.776
- Don't know, she never
told me her preferences.

25:17.690 --> 25:18.952
- Mm, touche.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.913
So who was this poor guinea pig?

25:27.351 --> 25:31.834
- Han Wynn, a
Vietnamese operative

25:31.878 --> 25:34.054
was the original subject.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.231
I guess they didn't wanna
test it on one of their own

25:37.274 --> 25:39.494
until they were sure it worked.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.279
[mid tempo music]

25:42.323 --> 25:43.498
- We are ready.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.895
- Han was former Senator
Benson's personal recruit,

25:48.938 --> 25:50.070
like all the ladies were.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.118
I think someone over
there owed him a favor.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.172
- Cat.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.487
[gun clocking]

26:16.531 --> 26:17.401
- Wait.

26:21.057 --> 26:24.931
- Switch off the safety
protocol, fully engaged Jim.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.194
- Yes, doctor.

26:29.718 --> 26:32.460
[dramatic music]

26:37.596 --> 26:38.466
- A shark.

26:48.432 --> 26:50.609
- Benson wasted no time
putting Han to work.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.919
It was supposed to be a
simple file retrieval job,

26:58.965 --> 26:59.966
but the mark came home,

27:08.888 --> 27:13.501
and the chip took over and
put her into survival mode.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.199
[dramatic music]

27:18.506 --> 27:21.770
[blows thudding]

27:33.695 --> 27:35.218
[knife slicing]

27:41.572 --> 27:45.489
Once the threat was
eliminated, the chip disengaged

27:48.405 --> 27:50.451
and Han realized
what she had become.

27:53.846 --> 27:56.675
- I take it Han didn't like
having a super spy chip

27:56.718 --> 27:57.588
in her head?

27:57.632 --> 27:58.894
- No she didn't.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.288
- But you do?

28:03.290 --> 28:05.031
- I do now,

28:05.074 --> 28:07.555
especially if it allows
me to spend time with you.

28:07.598 --> 28:10.514
- [chuckling] Okay,
that was a better line.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.953
Cheesy, but better.

28:13.996 --> 28:16.129
- I told you I was super smart.

28:16.172 --> 28:17.696
- I wouldn't take it that far.

28:20.742 --> 28:24.311
So is your plan to convince
me to go back to your place

28:24.354 --> 28:25.921
before my friend gets here?

28:25.965 --> 28:28.532
- Nope, your plan
is to convince me

28:28.576 --> 28:30.926
to go back to your place
before your friend gets here.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.624
- [chuckling] Really?

28:35.365 --> 28:37.280
Well, your story would've to
get a hell of a lot better

28:37.324 --> 28:38.804
for that to happen.

28:38.847 --> 28:39.413
- Oh, it does.

28:43.373 --> 28:44.287
Thank you.

28:47.900 --> 28:51.817
- Aren't you breaking some
super spy code or something

28:51.860 --> 28:53.862
by telling me all this?

28:53.906 --> 28:55.516
- Most definitely.

28:55.559 --> 28:56.909
- Won't you get into trouble?

28:57.997 --> 28:58.824
- Already did.

28:59.999 --> 29:00.913
And so did Han.

29:02.523 --> 29:03.959
Her chip didn't come
with all the bells

29:04.003 --> 29:05.569
and whistles mine does.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.833
No tracking or safety
protocols either.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.925
She wanted out, but
that's not how this works.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.449
[gun bangs]

29:28.549 --> 29:29.463
- Benson killed her?

29:30.899 --> 29:33.815
- Technically, yes, but
really the doctor did

29:33.859 --> 29:36.600
at the moment he put that
chip in agent Han's head.

29:36.644 --> 29:37.950
- The doctor?

29:37.993 --> 29:40.822
- Dr. Cain, the one
who invented the chip,

29:40.866 --> 29:42.781
the one responsible
for the whole program.

29:44.565 --> 29:47.481
- Nature knows no pause on
progress and development

29:48.830 --> 29:51.877
and attaches her
curse on all inaction.

29:54.009 --> 29:56.707
- Oh, that Dr. Cain.

29:56.751 --> 29:59.667
The secret super spy doctor.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.191
The one who apparently likes
quoting George Bernard Shaw.

30:02.235 --> 30:03.105
- That's the one.

30:05.412 --> 30:08.458
- But I've never heard
of Senator Benson.

30:08.502 --> 30:11.505
- Former senator, and
why would you have?

30:11.548 --> 30:12.723
Unless you lived in his state

30:12.767 --> 30:14.160
or cared about
appropriation bills.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.641
- That makes sense.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.556
He doesn't sound like
a very nice guy either.

30:20.862 --> 30:21.471
- He's not.

30:23.604 --> 30:25.954
- But at least he chose you
to be the first American

30:25.998 --> 30:28.304
to get a super chip
implanted in his head.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.697
- Not even close.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.221
I wasn't even the most American.

30:33.875 --> 30:37.139
That honor went to American
Indian, Ylan Romero.

30:37.183 --> 30:40.316
[serene music]

30:40.360 --> 30:42.231
After the Han disaster,

30:42.275 --> 30:44.451
the doctor was allowed to
choose the next subject.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.247
- A woman from
Washington is here.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.642
- [John] Ylan was a former
special forces soldier like me.

31:03.557 --> 31:07.778
Also like me, he had no
family, no connections,

31:07.822 --> 31:08.910
and no one to miss him,

31:10.303 --> 31:12.305
except for his old friend,

31:12.348 --> 31:14.655
the tribal police chief.

31:14.698 --> 31:17.440
- We'll watch you on TV
when you get your medal.

31:17.484 --> 31:18.877
- It won't be televised.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.924
Secret heroes just disappear.

31:37.330 --> 31:38.897
[car door slams shut]

31:43.597 --> 31:45.077
- Welcome to the program.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.429
- But Ylan ended
up going rogue too.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.867
He rescued someone
who needed rescuing

31:52.911 --> 31:54.825
and exposed the whole
program to scrutiny.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.959
- The disappearing secret hero.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.221
- Marena sure thought so.

32:00.483 --> 32:01.876
- But who's Marena?

32:03.312 --> 32:06.228
- An assistant to one of the
chip program's financiers,

32:06.272 --> 32:09.449
who stumbled across something
she wasn't supposed see.

32:11.625 --> 32:14.715
Her boss, Yuri Ketrov
had a lot of businesses,

32:16.456 --> 32:17.848
not all of them legal.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.375
Maybe Marina knew
about some of them,

32:23.419 --> 32:24.420
maybe she didn't,

32:25.595 --> 32:26.901
but she definitely didn't know

32:26.945 --> 32:28.468
what she was gonna
find out that day.

32:31.688 --> 32:32.559
- What is this?

32:34.039 --> 32:37.390
[keyboard keys clacking]

32:38.217 --> 32:40.654
[tense music]

32:56.975 --> 32:59.803
[suspenseful music]

33:23.088 --> 33:25.351
- [John] She knew how
dangerous Ketrov could be,

33:26.787 --> 33:28.223
but she had made her decision.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.357
There was no going back.

33:44.370 --> 33:48.548
[suspenseful music]

35:04.972 --> 35:07.409
- What you're doing is
wrong, and you know it.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.065
- Give her to Terezin.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.328
He always liked her.

35:17.637 --> 35:20.422
[Marena panting]

35:23.208 --> 35:24.992
- [John] And that's
when Ylan found her.

35:26.298 --> 35:29.127
[suspenseful music]

35:51.018 --> 35:53.847
[Marena screaming]

35:53.890 --> 35:57.024
- I'll be back tonight,
[Marena sobbing]

35:57.067 --> 35:58.852
and I'll take you to my house

36:01.159 --> 36:02.595
for a test run.

36:10.472 --> 36:11.691
[door slams shut]

36:15.956 --> 36:17.392
[knife slices]

36:23.311 --> 36:25.748
[door creaks]

36:27.228 --> 36:28.664
- Romero.
- Shh, shh.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.972
- But unlike the original chip,

36:32.015 --> 36:34.496
the one implanted in
Ylan did have tracking

36:34.540 --> 36:36.106
and safety protocols,

36:36.150 --> 36:37.499
so they were able
to reign him in

36:37.543 --> 36:39.197
before things got
too outta control.

36:41.155 --> 36:43.288
- You do have a lot of
details in your story,

36:43.331 --> 36:44.637
I'll give you that.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.595
- All good stories do.

36:46.639 --> 36:51.209
- Of course, and this
is where you come in?

36:51.252 --> 36:52.819
- No, not yet.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.908
I was still another
upgrade away.

36:54.951 --> 36:56.605
- Oh, do tell.

36:58.390 --> 37:01.088
- After Ylan's shaky start,

37:01.131 --> 37:04.483
they went right back to Benson
and his female subjects.

37:04.526 --> 37:05.919
- Easy on the eyes, I assume?

37:05.962 --> 37:09.836
- Of course, but this time,

37:09.879 --> 37:12.665
they chose a
civilian Bindi Lamar,

37:14.536 --> 37:16.538
supposedly saw her in a cafe.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.282
The thought was that if
they could train someone

37:21.326 --> 37:24.764
from the ground up, they
would've total control,

37:26.331 --> 37:27.680
a true sleeper agent.

37:33.512 --> 37:36.819
[keyboard keys clacking]

37:36.863 --> 37:39.518
[pensive music]

37:47.134 --> 37:48.309
- Fox,

37:54.272 --> 37:55.403
wolf,

37:57.275 --> 37:58.450
spider,

37:59.581 --> 38:00.843
cheetah,

38:04.064 --> 38:05.718
hawk.

38:15.815 --> 38:16.772
- And then there was light.

38:18.034 --> 38:19.253
- [John] And they wasted no time

38:19.297 --> 38:20.646
in testing out the new recruit.

38:24.302 --> 38:28.001
Mr. Titit, one of the
program's other financiers

38:28.044 --> 38:30.438
needed some files still
on the old fashioned way

38:30.482 --> 38:31.787
from a rival company,

38:34.355 --> 38:37.880
and he needed them
immediately, whatever the cost.

38:39.969 --> 38:42.189
So they sent the
unassuming Bindi

38:42.232 --> 38:43.886
to do what they
trained her to do.

38:48.195 --> 38:49.762
And if her natural
skills weren't enough,

38:51.590 --> 38:54.810
they were confident that the
chip would fill in the gaps.

38:59.162 --> 39:00.120
And they were right.

39:09.085 --> 39:09.695
- Here we go.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.916
[dramatic music]

39:28.366 --> 39:30.803
[door creaks]

39:39.464 --> 39:41.944
[gun bangs]

39:53.521 --> 39:55.958
[door creaks]

40:10.712 --> 40:12.758
- Oh, hell, score
one for the ladies.

40:14.455 --> 40:15.935
And she didn't go rogue?

40:15.978 --> 40:18.328
- No, no, she didn't go rogue.

40:18.372 --> 40:19.852
After Han, none
of the ladies did.

40:20.896 --> 40:21.810
- Oh, there were more?

40:24.073 --> 40:26.467
- Senator Benson
called them his crows

40:27.729 --> 40:29.252
because they could be anywhere,

40:30.253 --> 40:31.951
always watching, always waiting.

40:33.648 --> 40:35.911
- This guy sounds like
the ultimate creepy uncle.

40:37.696 --> 40:40.089
I hope your story ends with
some super spy taking him out.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.441
- I agree, that would
be a good ending.

40:44.703 --> 40:46.269
- But unless you're secretly

40:46.313 --> 40:48.446
the woman I'm meeting
here tonight in disguise,

40:48.489 --> 40:51.318
I assume that your program
started recruiting men again.

40:51.361 --> 40:53.842
- They did, as you can guess,

40:53.886 --> 40:55.061
the doctor wasn't satisfied

40:55.104 --> 40:56.889
with creepy uncle
Benson's loyal,

40:56.932 --> 40:58.499
but limited city of crows.

41:00.022 --> 41:03.025
He wanted to push the
technology forward

41:03.069 --> 41:05.680
and finally make a super spy.

41:06.899 --> 41:07.987
[dramatic music]

41:08.030 --> 41:09.336
And that's where I came in.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.817
[gun clocking]

41:13.079 --> 41:14.254
I was a finely tuned weapon,

41:20.390 --> 41:21.740
and that was before the chip.

41:25.657 --> 41:26.832
I had but two loves,

41:29.835 --> 41:30.836
serving my country,

41:36.842 --> 41:37.712
and the bottle.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.068
Sometimes, that second one
got in the way of the first.

41:57.906 --> 42:00.518
That's how the doctor
recruited me for the program,

42:01.475 --> 42:02.955
with the help

42:02.998 --> 42:06.785
of the doctor's very
convincing assistant, Vivian.

42:08.003 --> 42:10.528
[gentle music]

42:39.469 --> 42:40.949
- You'll be better than before,

42:42.168 --> 42:45.214
smarter and more
skillful in every way.

42:45.258 --> 42:47.129
You'll have the
calculating power

42:47.173 --> 42:49.436
of the most advanced
microchip ever invented,

42:51.133 --> 42:53.875
assisting you in any and
all decisions you may face.

42:55.747 --> 42:57.400
There won't be
anything you can't do.

43:02.318 --> 43:04.277
- I'm honored and
lucky to be chosen.

43:06.322 --> 43:09.978
- There is no good luck,
only good planning.

43:11.893 --> 43:13.678
- [John] It wasn't
that hard of a sell.

43:15.288 --> 43:20.032
Being a super spy, who
wouldn't want that?

43:20.075 --> 43:22.643
- Oh, so that's why you
think I'm gonna take you back

43:22.687 --> 43:25.994
to my place because
Vivian picked you up

43:26.038 --> 43:27.082
and took you back to hers.

43:28.867 --> 43:31.783
- Actually it was my place,
Vivian and I went back to.

43:31.826 --> 43:33.436
- Oh, well then,
we're good then.

43:33.480 --> 43:34.437
- My thinking exactly.

43:37.310 --> 43:40.052
- Either way, you could have
fooled me about being a drunk.

43:41.444 --> 43:42.968
You haven't even
touched your drink.

43:45.710 --> 43:47.059
- Score another
one for the chip.

43:49.104 --> 43:51.150
- Then again, the
doctor couldn't have
his prized super spy

43:51.193 --> 43:52.934
being a drunk now could he?

43:52.978 --> 43:53.892
- No he couldn't.

43:55.284 --> 43:56.546
But being sober has a way

43:56.590 --> 43:58.548
of making you see
things more clearly.

43:58.592 --> 44:00.768
[dramatic music]

44:00.812 --> 44:03.597
[gun banging]

44:03.641 --> 44:04.903
- Abort!

44:04.946 --> 44:06.948
- It's not working.

44:06.992 --> 44:09.690
[glass shattering]

44:10.604 --> 44:13.172
[gun banging]

44:17.263 --> 44:20.353
- So when I was escaping
the doctor and his facility,

44:20.396 --> 44:22.660
but before I made it down
to the basement mainframe,

44:23.878 --> 44:25.184
I stumbled across something.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.362
[monitors beeping]

44:38.850 --> 44:41.026
[tense music]

45:00.828 --> 45:02.221
Old test subjects.

45:04.614 --> 45:09.054
I didn't know if they were
dead, or discarded failures,

45:09.097 --> 45:12.013
or just previous attempts
lying there waiting for orders.

45:15.277 --> 45:16.104
And I didn't care.

45:18.324 --> 45:20.282
I just needed to
get to the basement.

45:39.824 --> 45:42.130
[keys beeping]

45:53.576 --> 45:56.144
[dramatic music]

45:56.188 --> 45:59.147
[soldier grunting]

46:10.724 --> 46:14.946
[blows thudding]

46:40.319 --> 46:43.365
[suspenseful music]

47:00.861 --> 47:02.123
Oh, hell.

47:02.167 --> 47:04.909
[dramatic music]

47:15.006 --> 47:20.011
[blows thudding]

47:55.611 --> 47:58.353
[screen beeping]

48:01.704 --> 48:04.316
- Wow, I guess
your upgraded chip

48:04.359 --> 48:06.100
really is the best version.

48:06.144 --> 48:07.406
- I'd like to think so.

48:09.364 --> 48:10.583
So how am I doing so far?

48:12.237 --> 48:15.066
- Well, considering
we're still in this bar,

48:15.109 --> 48:18.373
not back at my place,
I'd say not so good.

48:20.071 --> 48:23.248
- As I said, the chip's
still a work in progress.

48:27.817 --> 48:30.211
- I shouldn't be so hard on you.

48:30.255 --> 48:31.909
I'm just a lowly office drone

48:33.911 --> 48:37.436
who spends her days
sending pointless emails.

48:37.479 --> 48:38.654
Yes, this is Jane.

48:38.698 --> 48:40.134
Answering phones.

48:40.178 --> 48:41.353
Lemme write that down.

48:42.745 --> 48:46.314
Pushing papers, filing,

48:51.102 --> 48:54.975
and now attending a boring
outta town business conference.

49:07.770 --> 49:12.297
I would much rather be
home wearing sweats,

49:14.125 --> 49:15.430
sipping a glass of wine

49:18.956 --> 49:20.435
and getting ready for bed.

49:24.526 --> 49:27.747
- But instead, you're in the
hotel bar waiting for a woman

49:27.790 --> 49:30.489
who may or may not
have stood you up.

49:30.532 --> 49:35.320
- True, but at least your
completely 100% real story

49:36.190 --> 49:37.583
is entertaining me.

49:37.626 --> 49:39.585
- And you have a
brand new Lamborghini.

49:39.628 --> 49:42.066
- And I have a brand
new Lamborghini,

49:42.109 --> 49:45.330
[chuckling] please continue.

49:47.680 --> 49:50.900
- [John] After the fight, I
finally made it to the basement,

49:50.944 --> 49:52.337
plugged in the damaged
tablet I swiped

49:52.380 --> 49:53.599
from the doctor and Vivian,

50:01.389 --> 50:02.651
and sent out a message

50:02.695 --> 50:05.263
to activate all the
other chip owners.

50:05.306 --> 50:07.656
- He's trying to
get a message out.

50:07.700 --> 50:09.702
- [John] Actually to
use the doctor's term,

50:10.790 --> 50:12.531
I sent them all a suggestion.

50:15.099 --> 50:17.014
- And what did you
suggest for them to do?

50:18.493 --> 50:20.234
- The only thing I could,

50:20.278 --> 50:23.324
do as trained and strike
back those responsible

50:23.368 --> 50:24.325
for the chip program.

50:35.641 --> 50:37.251
Bindi was back at the cafe,

50:39.558 --> 50:40.994
unknowingly waiting
for the moment

50:41.038 --> 50:43.257
when they would
permanently deactivate her.

50:47.174 --> 50:49.829
I made sure she at least
had one last hurrah.

51:04.670 --> 51:06.889
Mr. Titit used her first,

51:09.196 --> 51:11.155
so I thought he
should see her last.

51:12.243 --> 51:15.898
[singing in foreign language]

51:34.091 --> 51:36.702
[Titit screaming]
[dramatic music]

51:36.745 --> 51:37.920
[gun bangs]

51:50.455 --> 51:51.978
The next suggestion
went to Ylan.

51:53.806 --> 51:56.113
Even though he was
back in the program,

51:56.156 --> 51:58.332
Ylan knew that after
rescuing Marina,

51:59.203 --> 52:00.378
his days were numbered.

52:04.033 --> 52:05.687
I'm sure he didn't
need much of a push

52:05.731 --> 52:10.649
to go after the target
I sent him, Yuri Ketrov.

52:11.519 --> 52:14.131
[dramatic music]

52:35.456 --> 52:38.067
[phone vibrating]

52:40.548 --> 52:41.810
- Hello.

52:44.683 --> 52:45.945
Victor!

52:53.170 --> 52:55.998
[suspenseful music]

52:58.653 --> 53:01.395
[dramatic music]

53:39.216 --> 53:40.652
- Oh, this story got exciting.

53:41.783 --> 53:44.221
There's just one
problem with it.

53:45.657 --> 53:47.224
- Only one?

53:47.267 --> 53:48.616
- Well, let's start with one.

53:50.444 --> 53:54.231
So all the upgraded chips have
tracking and safety protocols

53:55.971 --> 53:58.191
and you say you have the
most upgraded chip there is.

53:59.627 --> 54:00.846
How are you even here?

54:03.240 --> 54:06.504
Why aren't there soldiers or
spies kicking down the doors

54:06.547 --> 54:08.375
and shooting up the place?

54:08.419 --> 54:11.073
- You want me to skip
straight to the reveal?

54:11.117 --> 54:14.033
- Well, you said it
would only take an hour

54:14.076 --> 54:15.817
for you to explain why you
think I'm gonna take you back

54:15.861 --> 54:19.125
to my place, time's ticking.

54:19.168 --> 54:21.562
- And I have even less time
if your girlfriend shows up.

54:22.781 --> 54:23.782
- Not a girlfriend,

54:25.218 --> 54:26.524
just someone from the
business conference.

54:26.567 --> 54:28.177
Last minute meeting, I suppose.

54:28.221 --> 54:29.091
- Good to know.

54:30.789 --> 54:32.704
Well, to answer your question,

54:32.747 --> 54:34.271
my chip was temporarily blocked.

54:37.491 --> 54:38.710
That's why they can't track me

54:38.753 --> 54:40.189
or enact any
protocols right now.

54:41.626 --> 54:46.152
- [chuckling] Oh, so
out of all the recruits,

54:46.195 --> 54:47.849
only yours was blocked?

54:49.329 --> 54:51.331
Sounds convenient.
- It wasn't.

54:54.900 --> 54:57.294
Soon after my chip
was implanted,

54:57.337 --> 54:59.600
I met an agent, a real one,

55:00.427 --> 55:03.996
or rather, she met me.

55:05.780 --> 55:08.827
[upbeat rock music]

55:19.620 --> 55:20.665
- Can I buy you a drink?

55:24.712 --> 55:26.453
- I apparently no longer drink.

55:29.587 --> 55:30.849
- Thanks to the chip I presume.

55:35.593 --> 55:36.420
- Who are you?

55:38.335 --> 55:40.293
- Seems like that thing inside
your head does a lot more

55:40.337 --> 55:41.512
than the doctor said,

55:43.731 --> 55:46.691
none of it good for
you or the country.

55:48.475 --> 55:50.347
- If you knew the chip
was bad back then,

55:50.390 --> 55:52.958
why didn't you just
have it removed?

55:53.001 --> 55:54.916
- The agent told me why,

55:54.960 --> 55:57.441
something the doctor and
Vivian forgot to mention to me

55:57.484 --> 55:58.485
or the others.

56:01.314 --> 56:05.536
- If the chip is ever
removed or damaged,

56:05.579 --> 56:08.277
the effects on your brain
would be catastrophic.

56:13.108 --> 56:14.414
- Why are you telling me this?

56:15.720 --> 56:16.938
- We have common interests.

56:18.679 --> 56:20.202
I'm not even supposed to
know about your existence

56:20.246 --> 56:22.683
until tomorrow when
the doctor provides me

56:22.727 --> 56:25.773
with a demonstration
of your talents.

56:26.992 --> 56:28.254
- Then how do you?

56:30.691 --> 56:33.912
- Former employee
of your new bosses

56:33.955 --> 56:35.609
suddenly grew a conscience.

56:37.568 --> 56:39.657
She also provided me
with an access code.

56:42.747 --> 56:43.791
- They can track me?

56:45.532 --> 56:47.099
- They can do a whole lot
more to you than that.

56:49.841 --> 56:50.711
- What, I'm already dead?

56:52.670 --> 56:57.414
- Not yet, when they fully
activate your chip tomorrow,

56:58.893 --> 57:00.765
their access to you will
miraculously be blocked.

57:02.157 --> 57:03.942
That is until their
techs figure out

57:03.985 --> 57:05.770
that we change the access codes.

57:10.731 --> 57:12.167
- Then what do I do?

57:12.211 --> 57:15.954
- What you do best,
you serve your country

57:17.259 --> 57:18.391
and eliminate the threat.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.349
[gun banging]

57:20.393 --> 57:21.916
- Abort!

57:21.960 --> 57:24.049
- It's not working!
[glass shattering]

57:28.401 --> 57:29.663
[keyboard keys clacking]

57:29.707 --> 57:31.404
- And the first thing
I did with that code

57:31.448 --> 57:33.711
before I sent out
the suggestions

57:33.754 --> 57:34.973
was buy myself some more time.

57:36.801 --> 57:38.890
And I'm sure Alex has been
working around the clock

57:38.933 --> 57:40.718
ever since, trying
to crack the problem.

57:41.806 --> 57:42.937
[pensive dramatic music]

57:42.981 --> 57:46.332
[keyboard keys clacking]

57:51.163 --> 57:53.557
- Anything?
- Soon.

57:55.123 --> 57:56.473
- What do we do
when we find him?

57:57.430 --> 57:58.387
- You use this.

58:03.610 --> 58:06.787
[taser zapping]

58:06.831 --> 58:07.875
It'll damage the chip.

58:09.790 --> 58:10.878
- [Vivian] And fry his brain.

58:13.968 --> 58:18.407
- Super spies versus
regular spies, interesting.

58:18.451 --> 58:19.452
- Something like that.

58:20.845 --> 58:23.630
- So who takes out
creepy uncle Benson?

58:23.674 --> 58:25.589
You?
- No.

58:25.632 --> 58:28.374
- He's a former senator, a
little tougher to get to.

58:30.071 --> 58:30.898
- I thought you said there
would be a good ending

58:30.942 --> 58:31.856
to your story.

58:31.899 --> 58:35.163
- I did, but I'm just one man.

58:35.207 --> 58:38.427
I need a little help
with the happy ending.

58:38.471 --> 58:41.518
- [chuckling] I bet you do.

58:44.564 --> 58:47.611
- But fortunately,
you already helped.

58:47.654 --> 58:48.916
- And how is that?

58:50.396 --> 58:51.963
- Senator Benson's up
in your hotel room.

58:56.663 --> 58:58.143
- Excuse me?

58:58.186 --> 58:59.274
- That's why you're here.

59:02.843 --> 59:05.672
- I am here for a
business conference.

59:05.716 --> 59:07.631
- One that's conveniently
near this hotel.

59:11.199 --> 59:13.941
[dramatic music]

59:40.141 --> 59:41.578
[knocking on door]

59:45.233 --> 59:47.148
[door creaking]

59:48.454 --> 59:50.587
- There's my favorite girl.

59:51.849 --> 59:54.634
- Okay, that's not funny.

59:54.678 --> 59:57.245
I've never even heard
of Senator Benson.

59:57.289 --> 59:58.464
- Oh, he's hard to forget.

01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:14.523
- You lost a shoe.

01:00:19.354 --> 01:00:21.226
- I'm about to lose
a whole lot more.

01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:24.272
- Yes, you are.

01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:26.753
[tense music]

01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:11.015
[suspenseful music]

01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:22.113
[dramatic music]

01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:40.609
[door creaks]

01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:44.701
[dramatic music continues]

01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:48.443
[blows thudding]

01:01:59.759 --> 01:02:02.153
[Jane panting]

01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:10.727
- Really, oh so now
I'm an assassin too?

01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:14.208
- I think you prefer
the term super spy.

01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:16.123
- Oh, right, right.

01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:18.256
Did I just forget that too?

01:02:20.388 --> 01:02:21.955
- As Agent Wilds put it,

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:23.478
the chip does a lot more

01:02:23.522 --> 01:02:25.089
than the doctor
told us it could do,

01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:27.134
none of it good for
you or the country.

01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:29.658
- What?

01:02:32.618 --> 01:02:34.620
- They have a literal
kill switch built in,

01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:36.491
a memory block doesn't
seem too crazy.

01:02:41.148 --> 01:02:43.455
- Wait, wait, wait,

01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:47.589
now you're saying I'm one
of the doctor's subjects?

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:49.156
I have a chip in my head?

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:54.205
- Pretty much, Jane Doe.

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:57.774
[dramatic music]

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:38.118
[dramatic music]

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.736
[phone line ringing]

01:03:52.263 --> 01:03:54.569
- I think I will be able
to meet you after all.

01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:58.269
[dramatic music]

01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:33.608
Oh my goodness, an expense
account, why not use it?

01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:36.873
Get some food, maybe a drink,

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:41.878
and then go to sleep.

01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:03.377
- You're one of
Benson's crows, Jane.

01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:09.209
Well, you were one of
them, and now he's gone.

01:05:14.388 --> 01:05:16.477
- Okay, story time is over.

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.918
This has been very entertaining

01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:26.487
and probably one of the most
surreal nights of my life.

01:05:27.532 --> 01:05:28.750
- You were the only one of us

01:05:28.794 --> 01:05:31.884
who could have done
what you did, thank you.

01:05:35.322 --> 01:05:38.282
- Well, it was a pleasure
meeting you, John.

01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:42.677
Thank you for the Lamborghini,

meet here tonight.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.692

business conference?

01:05:57.736 --> 01:06:00.130

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:06.353
You know this because
you're super smart.

01:06:06.397 --> 01:06:07.659
- No, I know that

01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.400
because Sarah Wilds was
never gonna come here.

01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:15.623

who I was meeting.

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.277
How do you know her name?

01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:19.976

met at the bar that night.

01:06:25.633 --> 01:06:28.462

of course she is.

All right, I'm leaving.

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:33.641
Actually, I'm gonna go
to the ladies room first

01:06:33.685 --> 01:06:34.947

Maybe I have a

when you take me back

01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:07.045

even creepy uncle Benson

skills than you do.

You know, the doctor would
never let us go, Jane,

Suggestions you sent worked.

01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:12.893

01:12:16.593 --> 01:12:17.855
It's pretty damaged.

01:12:19.509 --> 01:12:20.771

The agency can fix anything.

01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:27.125

myself some more time.

01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:31.869

01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:32.783

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.830
I need a car.

Lamborghini is stolen.

01:13:44.855 --> 01:13:46.552

me when she had the chance?

01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:07.388
Right, you needed me to
take out Benson first.

01:16:07.432 --> 01:16:09.521
- Don't worry, she's
not touching you.

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.001
- Oh, I'm not worried.

01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:17.224
Now, what's to stop Agent
Wilds from aborting you?

01:16:17.268 --> 01:16:20.097
- She can't, I
changed my access code

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.228
when I hacked the system.

01:16:23.796 --> 01:16:26.407
- Oh, but the doctor's still
gonna want that tablet back.

01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:30.194
- Oh, he can take it
up with the agency,

01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:32.936
send them a memo,
request it back.

01:16:36.809 --> 01:16:39.333

financiers are dead.

You think you've won now?

01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:46.340

over other people.

pay your bill first?

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:12.018

is pretty much brain dead,

why keep him alive at all?

01:24:27.192 --> 01:24:30.108

It'll keep operating in
