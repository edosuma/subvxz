I know the drill, Tony.

04:23.788 --> 04:25.882
You know, it's not like
I won a trip to Paris.

04:43.746 --> 04:45.780
You have everything?
Your razor?

04:47.415 --> 04:48.942
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

04:49.018 --> 04:52.010

whatever I need.

04:52.085 --> 04:54.810
- Will you make sure you wear your sunblock?
- It's nothing.

04:54.888 --> 04:57.510
A little gambling charge,
that's all. It's gonna be fine.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.913
It's just-- You know,
better safe than sorry.

04:59.988 --> 05:02.983
I know, it's just-- This is
what life is still like...

05:03.046 --> 05:05.181
at our age?

05:06.685 --> 05:08.742
My tomatoes
are just coming in.

05:13.918 --> 05:16.040
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

05:16.118 --> 05:18.440
You seem good, Junior,
I gotta say.

05:18.518 --> 05:21.942
Fuck does that mean I'm fuckin'
incarcerated, for Christ's sake.

05:22.015 --> 05:25.712
The medicine, the aricept,
it agrees with you.

05:25.787 --> 05:27.913
You're not repeating
yourself so much.

05:27.947 --> 05:30.540
You gotta get me
out of here--

05:30.616 --> 05:32.711
The smell alone
in this fuckin' place.

05:37.048 --> 05:38.740
What do you hear
from my nephew?

05:38.818 --> 05:41.613
Tony? They sent me
a card for my birthday.

05:41.688 --> 05:44.113
I'm still waiting
for an apology. Tell him.

05:44.185 --> 05:45.942
All right.

05:47.048 --> 05:48.582
Which one of you's
gonna tell him?

05:48.647 --> 05:50.713
We'll figure it out,
Junior.

05:53.546 --> 05:55.681
If you made
an appointment

05:55.746 --> 05:57.942
With an outside dentist,

05:58.016 --> 05:59.612
That might do
the trick.

05:59.645 --> 06:01.942
What trick?

06:03.645 --> 06:05.742
We meet you there, and sneak you off
in our car.

06:08.248 --> 06:10.212
Dinner, 10 minutes.

06:10.315 --> 06:12.213

06:42.748 --> 06:45.110
Don't let 'em
take my plate, kid.

07:16.148 --> 07:18.480
Make sure there's enough

07:24.687 --> 07:27.513

- Caffeinated sodas and sugar.

07:27.546 --> 07:30.011
You know some of them

Gets them all riled.
I could lose my job.

07:40.786 --> 07:42.581

08:14.788 --> 08:17.442

08:18.546 --> 08:21.212
Right, the coke.

08:21.285 --> 08:23.242

08:23.315 --> 08:25.111
Ice cold,

Okay, ante up.

08:44.015 --> 08:46.411
This is nice, huh?

08:46.485 --> 08:48.412
A lile road trip,
just you and me--

08:48.487 --> 08:50.312
All things considered,
of course.

08:52.017 --> 08:53.980
Yeah, just like
the old days.

08:55.386 --> 08:57.382
Willie-Fucking-Overall,

08:57.447 --> 09:00.010
After all these years.

09:00.085 --> 09:03.483
You remember drivin'round with that
prick in the trunk looking for a spot?

09:06.646 --> 09:09.183
What was it, like a week
before A.J. Was born, right?

09:09.248 --> 09:11.113
No, Meadow.

09:11.186 --> 09:13.813
- Now she's gonna be a doctor.
- Yeah.

09:13.885 --> 09:16.481
Remember we took you
to luger's after

09:16.546 --> 09:18.412
Me, puss, Ralphie.

09:32.745 --> 09:36.011
Chevy Chase-- Fuck ever
happened to him?

09:42.588 --> 09:44.382
Let me ask you something.

09:44.448 --> 09:46.883
You mentioned Ralph before.

09:46.948 --> 09:49.281
A few years ago, he had
that beef with Johnny Sack,

09:49.347 --> 09:51.143
He made a crack about ginny--

09:51.215 --> 09:53.413
Huge fuckin' mole
on her ass or some shit.

09:53.485 --> 09:54.811
Yeah?

09:54.888 --> 09:57.540
Who the fuck would tell
Johnny about that joke?

09:57.586 --> 09:58.980
How should I know?

10:04.685 --> 10:06.713
Nine of clubs.

10:10.118 --> 10:11.911
You know, I try
to be cooperative,

10:11.988 --> 10:14.240
But it's that same
message over and over!

10:14.315 --> 10:16.781
Walter,
what do you got?

10:18.016 --> 10:20.313
Flush.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.413
No, you don't.
George?

10:22.488 --> 10:24.481
- Uh...
- What?

10:24.546 --> 10:26.081
- George, what do you got?
- Hmm?

10:28.585 --> 10:31.811
- Your hand.
- He's got alzheimer's!

10:31.885 --> 10:34.910
- Help him, for Christ's sake!
- Pair of jacks.

10:37.418 --> 10:40.882
Guy comes home with a
bouquet of flowers for his wife.

10:40.948 --> 10:43.382
"I guess I'll have to spread
my legs now," she says.

10:43.487 --> 10:46.010
"Why?" He asks
"don't you have a vase?"

10:53.216 --> 10:55.141
High rollers only.
Keep walkin', professor.

10:55.215 --> 10:57.413
I'm not here to gamble.
I'm here looking for Keith.

10:57.485 --> 10:59.213
Keith's busy. Take a hike.

10:59.287 --> 11:01.482
We have
a chess match, Keith.

11:01.606 --> 11:03.511
The pride of rutgers--

11:03.586 --> 11:05.541
Slits his wrists
in the faculty lounge

11:05.618 --> 11:07.110
After he stabbed
the an.

11:09.718 --> 11:12.812
At least some of us
know when we need help

11:12.885 --> 11:15.611
Get the fuck out of here,
ya fuck--

11:20.048 --> 11:22.683
What did the blind man say
when he passed the fish market?

11:23.946 --> 11:25.741
I don't know.

11:25.787 --> 11:27.710
"Good morning, ladies."

11:29.885 --> 11:31.740
What's going on, guys?

11:31.817 --> 11:34.011
- They're gambling, warren.
- Relax, Brian.

11:35.247 --> 11:36.780
What did we
say about this?

11:36.845 --> 11:38.310
What
it's a friendly game.

11:38.418 --> 11:40.810
Corrado it' s too
stressful. Look at him!

11:40.885 --> 11:42.942
He's not even playin'.

11:42.985 --> 11:45.983
Come on, guys. Let's wrap it up.

11:50.487 --> 11:52.582
I saw your girl today
at pet therapy.

11:52.646 --> 11:54.912
How does she keep
her coat so shiny?

11:58.248 --> 12:01.112
...they can be unexpected,
frightening events.

12:01.616 --> 12:05.582
But here, at the beautiful cradlelake national park,
they're just part of the scenery.

12:08.288 --> 12:11.083
Of south-Centre oregon, about
250 miles south of portland.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.541
I brought you your tea.

12:21.485 --> 12:24.042
You did a good job tonight,
kid. Here's your taste.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.240
That's all right.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.618
Take it.
You earned it.

12:35.784 --> 12:37.611
Time once, I was a kid.

12:37.689 --> 12:39.480
You know, my old man
was a stonemason.

12:42.119 --> 12:43.781
He took me to work--

12:43.847 --> 12:46.282
A job building a wall around
some rich lady's garden.

12:47.886 --> 12:50.213
She comes home.

12:50.287 --> 12:51.941
I help carry her groceries.

12:52.016 --> 12:54.183
She goes to give me
a quarter,

12:54.246 --> 12:57.243
Which was a lot in
those days, but I say no.

12:58.487 --> 13:01.813
She goes in. No sooner
does she close the door,

13:01.885 --> 13:05.183
When-- Crack! My old man gives
me a belt right across the mouth.

13:05.246 --> 13:08.043
"What are you, a millionaire?
You no need-A money?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.683
You no like-A eat?"

13:09.717 --> 13:11.141
Wow.

13:11.217 --> 13:13.240
Even still, he was right.

13:14.986 --> 13:17.081
He made me
walk home that night

13:17.146 --> 13:20.911
11 fuckin' miles from
essex fells back to newark.

13:20.985 --> 13:22.841
I'm from essex fells.

13:22.917 --> 13:25.243
A rich kid, huh?

13:28.647 --> 13:31.943
Uh... warren said I should
get my buttons back

13:32.015 --> 13:34.611
On account of we weren't
real supposed to be gambling.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.183
Tell warren
he can fuck himself.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.142
Got a problem with that,
tell him to come see me.

13:41.387 --> 13:42.812
Can I get a kit-Kat
at least?

13:42.915 --> 13:46.382
Do you believe this guy?

13:46.485 --> 13:48.611
Get the fuck out of here?

13:56.187 --> 13:58.740
Once in third grade.

13:58.818 --> 14:02.243
I got a 96 on my spelling test,
highest mark in the class.

14:02.316 --> 14:04.281
I was so proud.

14:04.346 --> 14:06.613
I brought it home
to show my dad.

14:06.716 --> 14:09.281
"What happened to thother
four points?" He says

14:11.046 --> 14:13.680
Fuck you!
Fuck... you!

14:22.585 --> 14:24.643
...uz f.M. Fredericksbur

14:26.887 --> 14:28.683
96.9.

14:28.746 --> 14:32.010
Paulie, we should stop.

14:32.087 --> 14:34.510
- Fuck are we
- Virginia.

14:36.787 --> 14:39.842
You remember that place--

14:39.918 --> 14:41.982
The dive with
the fuckin' massage beds?

14:42.086 --> 14:45.241
It was in culpepper,
virginia

14:45.317 --> 14:47.241
- The haveire.
- Ah!

14:48.788 --> 14:50.642
We met those 16-Year-Old
hillbilly whores

14:50.717 --> 14:52.241
Near the taxi stand

14:52.318 --> 14:54.181
Yeah.

14:54.247 --> 14:56.240
You want the old days,
let's go there.

14:56.316 --> 14:58.710
We'll get a room, bucket
of ice from the machine,

14:58.787 --> 15:01.142
Bottle of scotch,
order up a couple steaks.

15:01.186 --> 15:03.442
Heh heh heh.
Now you're fuckin' talkin'.

15:13.685 --> 15:16.783
Excuse me!
This place, is it new?

15:16.846 --> 15:19.010
I think maybe,
I don't know.

15:19.115 --> 15:21.411
There was a motel
on this spot though, right

15:21.487 --> 15:23.912
- The haveire?
- I don't know.

15:26.087 --> 15:26.111
Fuckin' guy.

15:32.116 --> 15:34.243
Mr. Spears,
you're all set.

15:34.316 --> 15:37.012
Two king rooms, one night,
checking out tomorrow.

15:37.088 --> 15:39.982
From 6:00 to 10:00 we offer a
complimentary buffet breakfast

15:40.048 --> 15:41.713
In the courtesy room
off the lobby.

15:41.785 --> 15:43.312
Sign there please.

15:43.385 --> 15:44.880
Can you have
room service send up

15:44.948 --> 15:46.610
Two fifths
of glenlivet?

15:46.685 --> 15:48.591
I apologize, sir,
we don't serve bottles.

15:48.635 --> 15:50.513
There is a minibar
in the room however.

15:50.588 --> 15:53.640
- All right, a couple steaks then
- With baked patoes.

15:53.718 --> 15:55.880
Wraps and lads only
after 11:00.

15:57.817 --> 15:59.511
Buckingham's
is still open though

15:59.585 --> 16:01.281
You could get some nachos.

16:06.018 --> 16:07.940
Your dad, boy.

16:08.017 --> 16:10.042
Him and me made this
trip a thousand times

16:10.116 --> 16:11.641
Back in the '60s.

16:11.716 --> 16:14.181
He had a piece
of that dog track, right?

16:14.246 --> 16:16.712
Among other things

16:16.816 --> 16:19.112
This one time,
my first trip ever,

16:19.185 --> 16:21.213
We're going
through georgia.

16:21.287 --> 16:23.742
He's got a '59 eldorado
with the fins.

16:23.846 --> 16:26.412
The biarritz,
he used to let me steer

16:27.516 --> 16:29.012
I'm like 20 at the time,
I'm a kid.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.283
Never been 5 miles out of newark.
Anyway, I'm drivin', we get pulled over.

16:35.386 --> 16:37.942
State trooper with the hat,
fuckin' sunglasses.

16:38.048 --> 16:40.613
I got no driver's license.

16:40.718 --> 16:42.283
Of course not.

16:42.347 --> 16:44.242
I'm shittin'
a brick.

16:44.316 --> 16:46.241
This is the deep
fuckin' south we're in,

16:46.346 --> 16:47.842
And we're Italian.

16:47.916 --> 16:50.110
I turn to your dad--
"What do I tell this prick?"

16:50.218 --> 16:53.141
"Relax," he says. "Tell
him your cousin's on the job

16:53.217 --> 16:55.040
He gives me
a southern-Sounding name.

16:55.118 --> 16:57.111
The guy comes over.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.810
"Oh, my cousin a state
troopetoo," I tell him

16:59.885 --> 17:01.611
"Maybe you know him."

17:01.688 --> 17:03.912
"What's his name?"
"Barney fife." Pow!

17:05.787 --> 17:08.310
The prick gives me a shot, I
don't know what the fuck hit me.

17:08.386 --> 17:10.442
Your dad's fucking
pissing himself.

17:10.486 --> 17:12.810
I mean, I never watch TV.
How the fuck do I know, right?

17:12.915 --> 17:16.540
- So what happened?
- Your dad had to "duke" the guy 100 fuckin' dolls.

17:16.615 --> 17:18.742
Probably a month's salary
in those days.

17:18.815 --> 17:22.839
You know, I remember you
around that time.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.642
When I was bad
my dad used to threaten me

17:24.748 --> 17:26.810
He was gonna get uncle
Paulie to come get me

17:28.788 --> 17:31.380
Fuckin' Johnny boy, ?

17:32.448 --> 17:34.742
He loved you, my friend.

17:34.818 --> 17:37.943
I remember the night
you were born.

17:38.107 --> 17:40.083
Only time
I ever saw him cry.

17:40.187 --> 17:42.280
Heh.

17:42.347 --> 17:44.381
It's funny, you know, I...

17:45.745 --> 17:47.880
never knew where
I stood with him.

17:49.346 --> 17:51.383
Like he didn't believe
in me or something.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.182
Fucking kidding?
He trusted you enough

17:54.246 --> 17:55.911
To give you
the willie overall thing.

17:55.985 --> 17:59.813
- And you were what, 24?
- 22

17:59.888 --> 18:01.681
So there you go then

18:10.248 --> 18:12.410
I tell the guy,
I said, "listen,

18:12.488 --> 18:13.982
I don't mind payin
for the tailpipe,

18:14.048 --> 18:15.812
But that fuckin' muffler
still under warranty."

18:15.885 --> 18:18.881
- All set?
- Yeah.

18:19.985 --> 18:21.812
- Nice talking to ya
- Yeah, you to

18:21.887 --> 18:24.243
Enjoy Miami.

18:26.548 --> 18:28.413
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

18:28.485 --> 18:31.281
- What?
- You tell some fuckin' goober your life story?

18:31.346 --> 18:33.713
We're supposed
to be laying low.

18:35.988 --> 18:37.913
I'm gonna grab
some danish for the road.

18:59.188 --> 19:02.240
- You have shit on your pants, don.
- Please be patient with him.

19:02.317 --> 19:04.312
Yes, ma'am.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.642
Visiting day
at the zoo.

19:09.718 --> 19:11.743
Don't feed the drools.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.410
- Uh, ma.
- How was church?

19:17.847 --> 19:19.380
It was fine.
It was good.

19:19.418 --> 19:21.042
You remember Mr. Soprano?

19:21.115 --> 19:23.810
Corrado, please.
Hello, my dear.

19:25.616 --> 19:28.041
- How are you today?
- I'd complain but who'd listen?

19:30.446 --> 19:33.143
They have me on some new
medication it makes me salivate.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.883
I'l leave you two to visit.
I have some letters to answer.

19:40.218 --> 19:42.212
- He's a good boy, this one.
- Thank you.

19:43.718 --> 19:46.981
I have this new medication they
put me on. It makes me salivate.

20:07.086 --> 20:09.043
How are you feeling?

20:11.887 --> 20:14.243
- Fine.
- Maybe you can clear something up.

20:15.917 --> 20:19.543
Dr. Mandl says you've been acting
aggressively toward other patients?

20:19.615 --> 20:21.980
First of all, that is
total fucking bullshit.

20:22.048 --> 20:25.182
- Carter-- - Secondly, why don't
you just lead off with that.

20:25.247 --> 20:26.810
What are you
talking about?

20:26.918 --> 20:29.242
Instead of pretending
to give a shit how I feel

20:30.687 --> 20:33.242
Now, apparently, you
are becoming a bully.

20:35.047 --> 20:38.111
Dr. Mandl feels you're modeling
your actions on the wrong people.

20:38.186 --> 20:42.440
- Ally? Like who?
- You know who. That gangster.

20:42.515 --> 20:45.841
You of all people should know not to
believe what you read in the paper.

20:45.916 --> 20:47.942
All that crap
they wrote about daddy.

20:48.015 --> 20:50.113
That was
"the wall street journal."

20:50.187 --> 20:51.682
It was entirely different.

20:51.746 --> 20:53.942
It's never enough, is it?

20:54.016 --> 20:56.980
My whole time at m.I.T., you told
me to get out and make friends.

20:57.046 --> 20:59.641
Now I finally do learn
to assert myself a little,

20:59.717 --> 21:01.710
Suddenly that's a negative.

21:08.088 --> 21:10.110
Checking in-- Spears.

21:16.088 --> 21:19.242
- Sil.
- I'll get us settled in.

21:21.688 --> 21:23.241
- Hey.
- It's not good.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.340
The feds found a body.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.343
Skeleton. They tentatively
I.D.'D it as the guy.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.213
- Ah, fuck.
- Try and relax, huh?

21:31.288 --> 21:33.411
How's Paulie holding up?

21:33.486 --> 21:36.412
Jaws are holding up fine.
He won't shut the fuck up.

21:36.487 --> 21:39.881
- That's too bad.
- What the fuck's he gotta worry about anyway?

21:39.918 --> 21:43.340
Scenario like this, the feds ain't
interested in him, believe me.

21:45.248 --> 21:47.882
Look, I love the guy
it's just...

21:47.947 --> 21:50.341
- you know how he is.
- Believe me, I hear you.

21:50.418 --> 21:52.340
What else?
Let me think.

21:52.417 --> 21:53.743
Um...

21:53.817 --> 21:55.541
I looked in on Carm
and she's okay.

21:55.617 --> 21:57.780
All right, thanks.

21:57.845 --> 21:59.913
Call me if you hear anything.

22:01.745 --> 22:04.283
...use your hat!

22:06.788 --> 22:09.281
- "And hope to hear
from you soon."

22:09.346 --> 22:11.843
"Sincerely--" No.

22:11.917 --> 22:14.040
"Respectfully
corrado Soprano."

22:15.747 --> 22:17.342
Read it back.

22:18.916 --> 22:20.412
"Dear vice president cheney,

22:20.488 --> 22:24.140
As a powerful man all too
familiar with accidental gunplay,

22:24.218 --> 22:27.511
I am writing in the hope that
you will intervene in my case.

22:27.585 --> 22:30.613
Like yourself, I was involved
in an unfortunate incident

22:30.687 --> 22:33.382
- When a gun I was
handling misfired."

22:33.448 --> 22:36.010
Head up, yo.

22:36.086 --> 22:39.712
- I's you, I'd lay off the card games awhile.
- Junior fuck the matter?

22:39.787 --> 22:42.440
The professor snitched
you out to Dr. Mandl.

22:45.917 --> 22:47.910
What do you do
with those, jameel?

22:47.985 --> 22:50.643
Autographed pictures of the
man who capped Tony Soprano?

22:50.718 --> 22:53.182

22:54.888 --> 22:56.610

when we were moving into the new house.

24:04.518 --> 24:06.913
Holy fucking shit.

24:11.847 --> 24:14.781
Mickey pinto
took that in 1963.

24:14.847 --> 24:16.643
Look at that hair.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.180

I tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna have my daughter.

24:49.217 --> 24:52.242
Scan them into the computer so I
can get a couple of copies for you.

24:55.485 --> 24:57.281

27:59.648 --> 28:02.013
I told tommy deleo
you're the boss now.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.040
This fucking deleo construction

28:42.146 --> 28:44.010
touche, "captain blood."

28:48.848 --> 28:51.143
Checkers,

29:05.116 --> 29:07.313
And if I don't, what the
fuck are you gonna do then?

29:07.415 --> 29:10.110
- You don't intimidate me.
- Corrado.

29:13.087 --> 29:16.683
- Yore lucky she's here, you little prick.

29:16.746 --> 29:19.611

So things don't go too far.
Oh, how the mighty have f--

God, no!

29:38.488 --> 29:41.811
I'm gonna kill this prick.

29:44.117 --> 29:46.310
Would you describe Mr.
Soprano as the agressor?

29:47.415 --> 29:49.142
Is he generally
a troublemaker?

29:49.215 --> 29:51.211
Nah, he cool.

29:51.288 --> 29:53.942
You just gotta know

Flea market.

30:04.548 --> 30:08.880

order for Soprano's meds.

30:31.647 --> 30:34.582
Yeah, I need a bridge loan
if ya could.

30:34.616 --> 30:37.541
- 200k.
- Done.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.942
What can I tell you?
I've been fucking mush lately.

30:40.017 --> 30:41.682
It happens.

30:41.747 --> 30:43.581
I lost the 1:00 game
by a field goal.

30:43.616 --> 30:46.143
It was a pick 'em. Then the
4:00 game I'm chasing the money,

30:46.215 --> 30:47.912
I picked
the 49ers minus two.

30:47.988 --> 30:50.911
Ah, fuck it,
you don't want to hear this.

30:50.986 --> 30:53.310
It's been this way
the last couple months though.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.741
Listen, this too shall pass.

30:55.846 --> 30:58.112
- Thanks, tatele
- Any time

30:58.188 --> 30:59.980
All right.

31:33.015 --> 31:35.112
Is this a nonsmoking room?

31:35.188 --> 31:37.081
Go ahead.

31:49.446 --> 31:51.841
Dinner was fun
the other night

31:51.947 --> 31:54.282
- Yeah.
- How do you know Peter?

31:54.346 --> 31:56.842
Who Peter?

31:56.916 --> 31:58.712
Beansie?

32:01.348 --> 32:03.682
He's an old friend...

32:03.748 --> 32:05.311
from the neighborhood.

32:05.346 --> 32:08.241
So the other guy?
The one with, um...

32:08.315 --> 32:10.340
white hair thingies?
What's his name again?

32:10.415 --> 32:13.641
- Paulie.
- Right.

32:13.718 --> 32:15.711
What is he,
like, your best friend?

32:15.785 --> 32:18.782
- He say that?
- I just figured.

32:18.845 --> 32:20.281
The way he was talking.

32:20.385 --> 32:23.540
Honestly, I thought hea was
your dad at first.

32:23.615 --> 32:26.242
There was a time
when I wished he was

32:28.748 --> 32:30.980
He-- He used to work
for my dad.

32:31.048 --> 32:32.712
I know, he told me.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.581
Corrado?
Corrado?

32:53.646 --> 32:56.181
- Huh?
- It's time for group.

32:59.287 --> 33:01.912
It's these new pills
last couple of days.

33:01.986 --> 33:03.813
I got no pep.

33:03.887 --> 33:07.681
Oh, that'll change. There's
a slight adjustment period.

33:07.745 --> 33:10.243
But I'm sleeping all the
time now. I can't focus.

33:10.347 --> 33:12.680
Just givit some time,
you'll feel a lot better

33:12.746 --> 33:14.642
And your memory will
improve too.

33:21.816 --> 33:23.942
You know
that's bullshit, right?

33:24.015 --> 33:27.010
They're trying
to numb you out

33:27.118 --> 33:29.811
'Cause of what you did
to the professor.

33:36.547 --> 33:39.013
Where the fuck
is this guy?

33:39.085 --> 33:41.713
West on 84,
beans said, right?

33:48.885 --> 33:50.210
There.

33:59.045 --> 34:01.742
What the fuck is this?

34:01.815 --> 34:03.741
Ho! Ho ho ho!
God damn it.

34:08.216 --> 34:10.081
Who's ramon?

34:11.848 --> 34:13.641
Waiting long?

34:13.715 --> 34:16.043
So everybody come tonight
except fharo?

34:16.116 --> 34:18.842
All right, hold
on, hold on, hold on.

34:18.917 --> 34:21.612
I'm Tony,
this is Paulie.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.681
This is esteban
and the rest of the guys.

34:25.685 --> 34:28.841
So our friend in the wheelchair tells
us you get regular access to goods?

34:36.187 --> 34:37.610
Okay.

34:37.685 --> 34:40.181
I got a trailer
full of power tools,

34:40.288 --> 34:42.112
Coming in later on
this month

34:42.185 --> 34:45.042
Factory-Sealed black
and decker and makitas.

34:45.118 --> 34:47.841
I can get for you
50¢ on the dollar.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.842
60 grand.

34:51.447 --> 34:54.139
Well, 55 would work but that
includes shipping to Jersey.

34:54.215 --> 34:55.840
We look
like fucking u.P.S.?

34:55.916 --> 34:59.513
Look, you send the truck up
north we send it back-Loaded

34:59.587 --> 35:02.081
I got a line on air mattress, pool toys,

35:02.148 --> 35:05.441
And I can round the load
out with kerastase,

35:05.515 --> 35:08.941
It's a French shampoo--
$20 a bottle retail.

35:09.017 --> 35:11.380
Now you get 5%
after sale,

35:11.447 --> 35:13.540
But that's gonna
involve a little trust

35:15.316 --> 35:17.312
Esta bien.

35:17.387 --> 35:19.481
All right.

35:19.586 --> 35:21.682
We're looking for
a long-Term relationship.

35:21.748 --> 35:23.941
- We'll be calling.
- All right.

35:24.016 --> 35:25.580
You okay, tío?

35:39.818 --> 35:42.442
Corrado, how you
doing today?

35:42.518 --> 35:44.883
I'm dying a slow death,
that's how I'm doing.

35:44.946 --> 35:47.082
Just take
your meds, yo.

35:47.148 --> 35:50.081
Real fucking
nazi now, huh?

35:50.145 --> 35:51.813
Stop fucking pushing!

35:51.887 --> 35:53.313
Ah! I wasn't!

35:53.385 --> 35:55.743
Jamee yo, stop bumping
dickheads out there!

36:17.416 --> 36:19.811
You should have
seen him out there.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.781
The fuck can
handle himself.

36:21.845 --> 36:24.980
He's got the gazzis
of a 20-Year-Old.

36:25.046 --> 36:28.981
He's my friend, but, Jesus,
what a fucking chiacchierone.

36:29.046 --> 36:30.641
"Yup-Yup-Yup-
Yup-Yup-Yup."

36:32.618 --> 36:35.681
Heells me, "don't say nothg
to nobody." He's got prostate.

36:35.747 --> 36:38.142
I say, "sure."
He tells everybody.

36:38.217 --> 36:40.411
He was always like that

36:40.518 --> 36:43.010
Nah, he was
Gary-Fucking-Cooper.

36:43.085 --> 36:44.382
You forget.

36:44.447 --> 36:47.842
One time, I fell asleep
while he was on the phone.

36:47.917 --> 36:49.812
I wake up
20 minutes later,

36:49.885 --> 36:52.212
And he was still going.

36:58.788 --> 37:01.582
I gotta say...

37:02.918 --> 37:05.012
it concerns me.

37:05.088 --> 37:06.511
Lately.

37:06.585 --> 37:08.512
Nah.

37:08.587 --> 37:10.311
Come on, huh?

37:13.085 --> 37:16.211
Hey, people live alone,
they get like that. It's sad.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.811
I'm leaving
for my card game.

37:20.845 --> 37:22.213
Are you two okay?

37:22.288 --> 37:24.512
- Dinner was great, hon.
- Any time, you know that.

37:24.588 --> 37:26.180
Thank you.

37:29.686 --> 37:31.941
That's a great girl
you got there.

37:32.018 --> 37:33.612
The way she stood by you.

37:33.687 --> 37:35.910
Now you see, that's what
Paulie doesn't got.

37:35.988 --> 37:39.542
Now I'm speaking
to your point.

37:39.616 --> 37:41.282
He's got no wife.

37:41.386 --> 37:43.011
He's got no kids.

37:43.047 --> 37:44.810
He's got no steady
income stream either.

37:46.388 --> 37:48.840
Except barone, which is
coming to an end.

37:48.886 --> 37:52.181
I told him, if you
can't show legit income,

37:52.245 --> 37:54.540
You're vulnerable
to the feds.

37:55.986 --> 37:57.713
He don't do
shit about it.

37:59.347 --> 38:01.913
I think you're worrying
for nothing, Tony.

38:04.018 --> 38:05.712
Things are going great.

38:05.816 --> 38:08.210
Finally.

38:08.248 --> 38:10.513
Maybe I'm just...

38:10.588 --> 38:12.683
waiting for the other
shoe to drop.

38:12.747 --> 38:14.610
All I know is,

38:14.686 --> 38:17.881
Paulie gualtieri
is a stand-Up guy.

38:17.986 --> 38:20.283
Has he ever really been
put the test

38:26.745 --> 38:30.742
You know, he had this
painting of me in his house.

38:30.847 --> 38:33.983
I was all dressed up
like a fucking general

38:35.588 --> 38:37.213
I heard about that.

38:37.285 --> 38:39.042
Yeah, it pissed me off.

38:39.145 --> 38:41.510
Thought it was
a fucking joke

38:44.218 --> 38:47.443
- But I don't think it was.
- He loves you, Ton'.

38:47.518 --> 38:49.310
You're all he's got.

38:49.388 --> 38:53.342
You, the guys
and his image.

38:58.046 --> 39:00.482
I love him too.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.542
You always did.

39:34.946 --> 39:36.282
Hey, sil.

39:36.348 --> 39:37.812
I'm here with Bobby.

39:37.885 --> 39:40.513
- He just got a call from jenna.
- Who?

39:40.587 --> 39:41.641
Karen's sister.

39:41.716 --> 39:44.012
Works in the courthouse

39:44.087 --> 39:45.840
Oh, yeah yeah.

39:45.918 --> 39:47.313
And?

39:47.388 --> 39:50.541
- Are you sitting down?
- Just fucking tell me

39:50.647 --> 39:52.283
Jackie Aprile.

39:52.348 --> 39:54.811
- What?
You heard me.

39:54.886 --> 39:57.510
Larry told them j.A.
Was totally responsible

39:57.588 --> 40:00.280
For the death of a certain
African-American person

40:00.346 --> 40:03.483
- He covered your ass
- Congratulations, Anthony!

40:03.517 --> 40:05.910
Yeah, well...

40:05.985 --> 40:07.583
you got to wonder
what's next, huh?

40:07.647 --> 40:09.642
Yeah,
but for tonight, huh?

40:09.718 --> 40:12.582
All right, thanks.

40:12.646 --> 40:14.280
Talk to you later.

40:42.288 --> 40:43.981
Ha-Ha-Ha!

40:50.215 --> 40:52.782
We're off the hook on
this willie overall thing.

40:52.847 --> 40:55.540
Oh! Thank God
that's fucking beautiful.

40:55.615 --> 40:57.483
Yeah.

41:02.887 --> 41:04.711
Know what we ought to do?

41:04.785 --> 41:07.742
We ought to treat ourselves
before we leave.

41:07.817 --> 41:10.910
I was thinking maybe we'd
do some sport fishing.

41:10.985 --> 41:12.510
You serious?

41:12.588 --> 41:13.811
Yeah
what are you kidding,

41:13.887 --> 41:15.712
The fucking marlin
they got out here?

41:15.787 --> 41:17.810
We'll rent a boat.

41:20.017 --> 41:22.440
Yeah. Sure.

41:24.916 --> 41:28.410
"What's that got to do with
chicken farming?" He asks.

41:28.486 --> 41:32.440
The whore says, "last year,
I raised over 5,000 cocks."

41:35.018 --> 41:37.380
- Where you going?
- The head. I gotta piss

41:37.448 --> 41:40.711
- One more?
- Yeah. One more.

41:42.245 --> 41:44.282
Two fags decide
they want a baby.

41:44.347 --> 41:46.480
So they Jack off
in a cup

41:46.546 --> 41:49.183
Use the sperm to get a lady
friend of theirs pregnant.

41:49.246 --> 41:51.483
Nine months later,
they go to the hospital.

41:51.547 --> 41:53.683
They see all the babies
in the nursery.

41:53.747 --> 41:56.012
"Look," they say.
"Our baby's the sweetest one.

41:56.087 --> 41:58.613
He's not en
crying at all."

41:58.685 --> 42:02.111
Ah... God damn it,
what the fuck is it?

42:02.186 --> 42:03.940
"Now he's not crying,"
the nurse says.

42:04.017 --> 42:06.782
"Just wait till we take the
pacifier out of his ass."

42:13.586 --> 42:16.440
Oh, fuck me!

42:17.885 --> 42:20.441
Accident! Accident!

42:20.518 --> 42:24.011
God fucking damn it!

42:24.086 --> 42:25.982
Corrado,
what happened?

42:26.046 --> 42:28.540
Oh, Jesus Chris
on the cross.

42:28.618 --> 42:30.142
It's all right.

42:30.217 --> 42:31.910
Come on.

42:34.185 --> 42:37.313
I'm an old man. It was an
accident, for Christ's sake.

42:37.388 --> 42:40.682
You're on ditropan specifically
to avoid incontinence.

42:40.748 --> 42:44.613
Not to mention celexa, which should
be curtailing your aggressiveness.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.511
I'm taking my medication.

42:46.586 --> 42:48.443
Ask hormel,
you don't believe me.

42:48.516 --> 42:50.783
Jameel.
He's been let go.

42:50.848 --> 42:52.542
Mr. Soprano,
thers a mutual trust

42:52.618 --> 42:55.812
Among the staff and our
patients regarding treatment.

42:55.888 --> 42:03.803
"Now he's not crying,"
the nurse says.

42:03.868 --> 42:06.603
"Just wait till we take the
pacifier out of his ass."

42:06.668 --> 42:08.633
Right, yeah.

42:13.438 --> 42:16.402
Oh, fuck me!

42:17.735 --> 42:20.300
Accident! Accident!

42:20.368 --> 42:23.860
God fucking damn it!

42:23.937 --> 42:25.832
Corrado,
what happened?

42:25.906 --> 42:28.430
Oh, Jesus Christ
on the cross.

42:28.508 --> 42:30.003
It's all right.

42:30.068 --> 42:31.802
Come on.

42:34.067 --> 42:37.161
I'm an old man. It was an
accident, for Christ's sake.

42:37.236 --> 42:40.530
You're on ditropan specifically
to avoid incontinence.

42:40.605 --> 42:44.460
Not to mention celexa, which should
be curtailing your aggressiveness.

42:44.538 --> 42:46.360
I'm taking my medication.

42:46.435 --> 42:48.302
Ask hormel,
you don't believe me.

42:48.367 --> 42:50.630
Meel.
He's been let go.

42:50.705 --> 42:52.401
Mr. Soprano,
there's a mutual trust

42:52.465 --> 42:55.663
Among the staff and our
patients regarding treatment.

42:55.738 --> 42:57.930
That means you
have a choice--

42:58.005 --> 42:59.701
You can either
wear depends

42:59.768 --> 43:02.062
While you await transfer
to another facility,

43:02.136 --> 43:04.603
Or you can take your
medication as prescribed.

43:13.035 --> 43:16.002
Here, corrado.
Time for your medicine.

43:20.735 --> 43:22.701
Where the fuck
is my ipod?

43:22.766 --> 43:24.762
Every day it's
your ipod, carter.

43:24.835 --> 43:26.531
<i>Just stop causing
a commotion!</i>

43:43.606 --> 43:45.302
What'd you do that for?

43:45.365 --> 43:47.133
I should piss
myself again?

43:47.205 --> 43:49.031
But I did the thing.

43:49.108 --> 43:51.430
They're muscling me,
what do you want me to tell you?

43:51.508 --> 43:54.300
I could have
gotten in trouble.

43:54.367 --> 43:55.930
You don't even
give a shit.

44:01.165 --> 44:03.062
Let's get
a card game together.

44:03.135 --> 44:04.962
- They fired hormel.
- Jameel?

44:05.038 --> 44:06.602
Fuck him! You got me.

44:06.665 --> 44:09.831
Maybe tomorrow, kid.
I don't know. I'm tired.

44:30.736 --> 44:33.603
Old ironsides!

44:34.966 --> 44:37.730
Ho! You're supposed
to say "who, beansie?"

44:37.806 --> 44:39.832
Yeah.

45:42.638 --> 45:45.001
Where you been?

45:45.068 --> 45:47.261
You didn't come
to lunch.

45:49.935 --> 45:51.433
I brought you
these--

45:51.507 --> 45:54.730
From Keith.
He owed me money.

45:54.808 --> 45:57.202
"Hootie
and the blowfish."

45:58.668 --> 46:00.332
Thanks.

46:03.237 --> 46:05.762
That was a nice letter
you wrote to cheney.

46:05.838 --> 46:07.731
But he don't
read 'em himself,

46:07.808 --> 46:10.162
They got computers
that do it.

46:10.238 --> 46:12.761
I asked lynch,
the professor.

46:12.838 --> 46:15.160
What are you talking
to him for?

46:15.235 --> 46:18.161
He says we'll have a better chance
if we write him at his outfit--

46:18.236 --> 46:19.801
Halliburton.

46:21.306 --> 46:23.962
My father
owned grumman ock.

46:27.706 --> 46:31.130
My grandpa said my dad
lacked character.

46:33.838 --> 46:36.101
Grandpa was a lion.

46:37.605 --> 46:40.603
You're very smart,
Anthony.

46:42.605 --> 46:44.933
I'm sure you're very
good with spelling too.

47:31.065 --> 47:33.500
Rigatoni a la Paulie.
He-He!

47:33.568 --> 47:37.131
But since you're eating it, maybe
it should be "rigatoni a la Tony"?

47:37.208 --> 47:38.602
Heh heh.

47:38.666 --> 47:40.703
Ah!

47:40.765 --> 47:42.233
Oh, madonn'!

47:47.566 --> 47:49.100
What?
You're not hungry?

47:49.167 --> 47:51.663
My fucking stomach.

47:58.707 --> 48:00.863
You know, when you
went down below,

48:00.936 --> 48:02.930
I thought I saw
a whale.

48:03.008 --> 48:05.403
- No shit.
- It made me think of ginny Sack.

48:12.268 --> 48:15.233
That joke Ralph made about
her, that was some funny shit,

48:15.307 --> 48:16.963
No matter what John said.

48:17.038 --> 48:19.401
You got to have
a sense of humor, right?

48:19.465 --> 48:21.730
Yeah.

48:26.665 --> 48:29.503
I heard she took
an office job.

48:29.568 --> 48:33.401
- Chubb insurance.
- Heh heh!

48:37.908 --> 48:40.400
It was you
told him, right?

48:40.465 --> 48:41.733
I mean, it's no big deal.

48:41.806 --> 48:43.560
I could hardly resist.

48:43.635 --> 48:45.633
Grapevine, Ton'.
I don't know.

48:45.736 --> 48:47.733
Yeah.

48:47.808 --> 48:50.502
He was a funny prick,
that Ralph.

48:50.565 --> 48:53.401
His "gladiator" fixation,

48:53.468 --> 48:56.133
The time he hit georgie
in the eye with the chain.

48:56.207 --> 48:58.101
Heh heh heh!

48:58.166 --> 49:02.231
I'd have loved to have seen John's
face when he heard that crack.

49:02.308 --> 49:05.800
Always fucking holier-Than-Thou
'cause he didn't fuck other women.

49:07.705 --> 49:10.063
Mr. Broomstick-Up-
His-Ass.

49:10.135 --> 49:12.203
Heh heh heh.

49:12.268 --> 49:14.733
You know,

49:14.805 --> 49:18.933
No offense, but-- You ever had
yourself checked for tourette's?

49:19.008 --> 49:20.931
What?

49:21.006 --> 49:22.263
Tourette's syndrome--

49:22.336 --> 49:23.760
Seriously.

49:23.837 --> 49:26.761
"Heh heh." It's like you
got a tick or something.

49:26.836 --> 49:30.363
I dunno. It's like some
people grind their teeth.

49:30.435 --> 49:33.033
When I'm nervous--
Tense or something.

49:41.738 --> 49:44.600
Come on, you told
John about that joke, right?

49:54.367 --> 49:57.003
- It wasn't me, Ton'.
- No?

49:57.065 --> 49:59.331
That's right.

50:08.805 --> 50:10.831
You want a drink?

50:10.905 --> 50:13.431
All right, stewarts.

50:49.765 --> 50:51.263
- Think fast!
- Jesus! Ton'!

50:51.335 --> 50:53.833
Fuck, that hurt.

52:19.805 --> 52:22.702
What does it take
to get something to eat?

52:41.565 --> 52:43.160
When my time comes,

52:43.236 --> 52:46.861
Tell me,
will I stand up?

53:09.065 --> 53:10.461
Who was at the door?

53:10.536 --> 53:13.561
"Williams-Sonoma.
From Paulie.

53:13.638 --> 53:18.163
The elektra semiautomatic
chrome espresso machine."

53:18.238 --> 53:20.161
- So?
- My God, Tony.

53:20.238 --> 53:22.362
This is, like, $2,000.

53:22.438 --> 53:24.603
I mean, what is
wrong with that man?

53:24.665 --> 53:27.462
What's wrong with him?
Nothing.

53:27.535 --> 53:30.331
It's guys like him that allows
our whole lifestyle here.

53:41.806 --> 53:43.960
Take me over
to Jeanette's house.

53:54.507 --> 53:56.000
Ah!

54:21.537 --> 54:24.603
<i>In an apparent
escalation of a mafia power struggle...</i>

54:24.665 --> 54:26.732
what year? Let me see,

54:26.805 --> 54:29.532
'72, '73, back in
the Feech LaManna days.

54:29.606 --> 54:33.003
I'm on a roll. I mean, I haven't
lost a bet in fucking months.

54:33.067 --> 54:35.363
<i>...after a brazen
ambush by...</i>

54:35.436 --> 54:36.930
hey, Ton',
you see this shit?

54:37.008 --> 54:38.760
Skip.

54:38.837 --> 54:40.301
Hey.

54:40.367 --> 54:43.401
Looks like Phil's the main
guinea over there now, huh?

54:43.465 --> 54:45.162
Anyway, we're at
maxwell's plum,

54:45.235 --> 54:47.560
The Saturday night
before the game.

54:47.635 --> 54:50.660
Who walks in
but fucking namath?

54:50.738 --> 54:53.861
<i>Three sheets to the wind,
fuckin' staggering like a sailor.</i>

54:53.935 --> 54:56.602
<i>So I know the game is
going into the toilet.</i>

54:56.666 --> 54:58.103
<i>I said to
my brother jerry--</i>

54:58.166 --> 54:59.701
<i>He was just
a kid at the time--</i>

54:59.767 --> 55:02.731
<i>"Take this money down
to old caruso on the corner</i>

55:02.806 --> 55:04.900
<i>And put it all
against the jets."</i>

55:04.966 --> 55:08.733
<i>My brother was just recovering
from rheumatic fever...</i>
