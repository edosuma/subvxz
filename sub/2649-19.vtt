00:02.628 --> 00:05.802
Councilwoman Dunphy,
how do you respond to allegations ...

00:05.881 --> 00:08.555
that you look super sexy
in your new suit?

00:08.634 --> 00:10.011
I haven't been
elected yet.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.346
Come on, kids!
We gotta vote!

00:12.471 --> 00:14.849
Honey, come on. Please stop filming.
I'm just excited.

00:14.932 --> 00:18.482
After today, you are
going to be a Councilwoman,

00:18.560 --> 00:20.813
and I am going to be
a first husband.

00:20.896 --> 00:23.490
Well, if you don't stop filming,
you're going to be my first husband.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.033
All right, everybody,
come on!

00:25.108 --> 00:26.701
You know what you're doing, kids?

00:26.777 --> 00:29.656
You guys are manning the phone banks.
Alex, you're in charge of that.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.580
What? Why is she in charge? And
wh-what's a phone bank? That's why.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.122
Phil?
I got it.

00:35.202 --> 00:38.001
I will be driving 50 of our finest
senior citizens to the polls,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.378
assuming, of course, that they
remember that I'm coming for them.

00:40.499 --> 00:41.796
Redirect.
High five.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.170
- Old people occasionally forget things.
- Okay.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.093
All right, everybody, let's go. Wait, wait.
Real quick. Sorry.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.095
Everybody get in there.
Jump in there.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.269
I just want to say how
proud of you we all are.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.187
You're an inspiration.

00:54.263 --> 00:57.107
Who would've thought that 20 years ago, when
you were still in the bloom of your youth-

00:57.182 --> 00:59.059
Okay, I'm gonna
go start the car.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.644
Claire likes to win.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.946
When she was eight,
a little Girl Scout friend of hers ...

01:03.021 --> 01:05.319
bragged she could
sell the most cookies.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.322
Damned if Claire didn't
walk the neighborhood ...

01:07.401 --> 01:09.324
till she got blisters
on her feet,

01:09.403 --> 01:10.871
and won by 10 boxes.

01:10.946 --> 01:14.621
Best part is, Claire
wasn't even a Girl Scout.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.752
The choice is Claire.

01:17.828 --> 01:21.253
Vote Claire Dunphy
for town council!

01:21.331 --> 01:24.084
What?  Oh, I love it!

01:24.167 --> 01:26.169
- What do you think, huh?
- I love it.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.880
We got it on Craigslist.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.635
- Came off a taco truck.
- It did.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.062
I love that you're doing this for me.
Thank you!

01:35.137 --> 01:36.980
You 're welcome!

01:37.055 --> 01:38.648
I know how important
winning is to Claire.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.735
And I love to festoon things.
We're her dream team.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.609
So we cleared the whole day, dropped Lily
off at school and voted first thing.

01:44.688 --> 01:48.693
Although one of us had a bit
of a dimpled chad situation.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.698
Can you tell me how this
machine works again, Chad?

01:50.777 --> 01:53.496
Oh, sure,
no problem.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.791
Just vote over here. Just-

01:57.075 --> 02:05.085
# Hey, hey #

02:05.167 --> 02:06.339
# Hey ##

02:08.169 --> 02:09.967
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:11.506 --> 02:15.136
I can see Claire-ly now
that Duane is gone!

02:15.218 --> 02:18.097
Bye! Thank you!

02:18.180 --> 02:20.808
Oh, my gosh. Okay, everybody, get in the car.
Let's go, let's go.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.359
Good luck today, Claire.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.936
Oh, Laurie, thank you.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.942
By the way, we have
some really good news.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.191
What's that? Becky got into
the University of Oregon.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.150
Oh, congratulations.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.735
Any news, Haley?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.286
Uh, no, not- not yet.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.615
But, you know,
super psyched!

02:35.697 --> 02:37.199
This whole waiting to hear thing ...

02:37.282 --> 02:39.034
has been a nightmare
since the very first letter.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.663
I'm too nervous.
I can't do it.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.003
"Dear Ms. Dunphy,

02:46.083 --> 02:48.085
we regret
to inform you-"

02:50.796 --> 02:53.720
What?
Don't leave me hanging.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.803
After that, I decided to only
tell my parents good news.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.305
I have one school left.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.140
The only good news
I've gotten is that ...

03:01.223 --> 03:04.227
my annoying neighbor Becky
is moving back east to Oregon.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.812
Manny, write this down.
I didn't bring a pen.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.899
Election day
is America at its finest.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.234
The people speak
and the government listens.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.785
I don't know
what they do in Colombia.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.282
No one does,
and don't ask.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.285
I mean, we know
that voting's a privilege,

03:17.364 --> 03:20.368
but for my daughter to have her name on
that ballot, it just means so much more-

03:22.035 --> 03:24.959
You know what? I think I'm gonna vote later.
What? Where you going?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.881
The line is too long.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.836
It's only three people,
and nobody has a gun.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.670
Eh.

03:31.753 --> 03:36.350
We 're here! We 're Claire!
Get used to it!

03:36.425 --> 03:40.475
Mmm. You know, I'm not sure if that's tracking.
Here, let me try one.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.933
You don't have to be Claire-voyant
to know who to vote for!

03:44.808 --> 03:47.277
Vote Dunphy
for town council.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.229
Uh- Uh-
Uh, Claire Dunphy.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.110
Uh, C-Claire's
her first name.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.567
I'm sorry
if that wasn't Claire.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.195
Oh, my God,
look at that.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.871
There's a trash can
right there,

03:57.946 --> 03:59.869
and that guy just threw
his paper on the sidewalk.

03:59.948 --> 04:04.454
Hey, you in the yellow jacket. Pick
it up and put it in the trash.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.173
Oh-
Sorry!

04:08.290 --> 04:10.964
Oh, my God, he did it.
Yes, he did.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.295
Ooh, here,
let me try one.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.801
Hey, dragon tattoo!
No jaywalking!

04:16.923 --> 04:19.642
Oh, my gosh, this is
an instrument of power.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.105
How could they not sell tacos? You
know what we could do with this thing?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.683
Cam, we could really
make a difference.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.518
We could be
the voice of change.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.023
Ooh, I got it.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.197
Let's go yell at the dry cleaner
that lost my shirt.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.195
Come on, gang.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.778
Today is the Dunphys
at their best.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.614
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.074
- Hey.
- I'm from the Weekly Saver.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.125
Mind if I ask you a couple
questions about the big election?

04:44.201 --> 04:45.703
Not at all.
Fire away.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.538
Who are you
voting for today?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.707
Claire Dunphy.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.758
Finally. I've been waiting
for someone to say that name.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.345
Why?
Because I am Claire Dunphy.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.717
Oh. I'm sorry.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.175
They moved me over from ad sales.
We take turns reporting.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.134
How do you feel
about your chances today?

05:01.259 --> 05:04.229
Not as good as I did a few minutes ago.
No, she feels great.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.853
Urn, her spirits are high.
The whole family's high.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.980
There's your headline.
Phil-

05:09.059 --> 05:10.936
- How about a photo of all of you?
- Sure. Yes. Yes.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.109
Mom. Mom, Mom. Tag. Oh, my goodness.
Thank you.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.907
That would have been
a really awkward picture.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.325
Okay.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.199
Oh!

05:20.278 --> 05:22.076
What is that? Is that a tooth?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.824
Ewww!
Awesome!

05:23.949 --> 05:25.667
How old are you?
Do it again.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.962
- How does that even happen?
- It's a fake tooth from an old ice skating injury.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.210
It just fell out. Oh, my gosh.
Why today?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.712
Let's not overreact.
Let me see it.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.669
Okay.
All right.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.467
Oww!

05:37.546 --> 05:39.719
Got it. Thanks.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.974
- What happened back there?
- The line was too long. I couldn't wait.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.061
I've seen you wait 45 minutes
in line for sherbet.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.111
Well, I happen
to like sherbet, okay?

05:54.187 --> 05:57.031
That place I take you has the
greatest sherbet on the West Coast.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.405
They got lime sherbet,
they got coconut sherbet.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.952
Why are we talking
about sherbet?

06:01.027 --> 06:03.405
- He's clearly changing the subject.
- Why aren't you in school?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.990
He's doing it again.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.246
Manny's right.
You're being very ardilla.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.290
Ardilla?
Yeah, you know.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.747
- The- The one th-that-
- Rabbit. I was being "rabbity."

06:11.830 --> 06:14.299
- No, the one with the cheeks and tail and-
- Chipmunk.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.672
- Possum.
- Okay, obviously she means squirrel.

06:16.751 --> 06:20.551
- You were being squirrelly then, you're being
squirrelly now. -Better than bein' a rat.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.174
Manny, give us a minute.
Oh, sure.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.555
I served him up
on a silver platter.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.144
What?

06:31.099 --> 06:33.022
All right,
it's no big deal.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.355
There was a woman working there.
I didn't want her to see me.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.190
- Who is she?
- Her name is Dottie.

06:38.273 --> 06:42.323
- She's the first woman I dated after my divorce.
- You dated a Dottie after Dede?

06:42.402 --> 06:46.032
You're focusing on the wrong thing here.
The point is, it ended badly.

06:46.114 --> 06:50.460
I tried to let her down easy, but,
uh, she didn't take it too well.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.539
Actually, I don't know how she
took it 'cause I wasn't there.

06:53.622 --> 06:57.126
We dated a few weeks,
then after we, you know-

06:57.208 --> 07:00.508
I slipped out of her house before she
woke up and never called her again.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.931
Put my pants on in her yard,
put the car in neutral,

07:03.006 --> 07:04.929
let it roll down the driveway,
lights off.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.477
Hey, I can't talk
about this anymore.

07:07.552 --> 07:11.022
So because of this woman, you
didn't vote for your daughter?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.350
It's Claire.
We need her to win.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.277
I don't want to be around when
something that tight comes unraveled.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.277
I'll figure out something. Maybe
those poll workers take shifts.

07:19.356 --> 07:23.736
Stop hiding in your little cave
like a- like, you know, like the-

07:23.818 --> 07:25.536
the- the-

07:25.654 --> 07:27.873
I really don't want to do this again.
No, th-the big one.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.208
Like the monster furry one.

07:30.325 --> 07:33.545
Why can't I remember any animal names?

07:33.620 --> 07:37.341
Climb aboard
the Dunphy Express.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.837
Next stop, democracy.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.336
What? No, no.
Please don't go.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.170
I won't do that anymore.
I promise.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.052
Oh. Uh, we need to
make a quick stop.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.676
I gotta pick up my new glasses.
No can do.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.603
I, uh- I got a lot
of people waiting, so-

07:50.679 --> 07:52.226
it'll just take
two minutes.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.309
I can't even see the ballot
without my glasses.

07:55.392 --> 07:59.522
I mark the wrong box, next thing you
know, I'll be married to a guy.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.732
Yeah, I-l don't think
it's mandatory, Walt.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.115
I'm a good dancer.
They'll come for me.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.703
They will break all your buttons and
say you brought it in that way!

08:10.824 --> 08:12.326
Okay, go, go, go!

08:12.409 --> 08:15.162
Turns out we had
a lot of axes to grind.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.998
And a hybrid, so there was
virtually no stopping us.

08:18.081 --> 08:22.837
Do not see that movie.
You will neither laugh nor cry.

08:22.919 --> 08:26.173
Best pizza in the city? Not
even the best' pizza on the street.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.805
They do not do the hair of the
people on those pictures.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.229
Totally ?ee checking ?
Don't bank on it.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.774
Okay, that was really fun, but now we
gotta go back to campaigning for Claire.

08:36.890 --> 08:40.145
We've been saying that for two hours.
Yes, but now I really mean it.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.356
- Oh, my God, there's Sandy.
- Sandra Bullock?

08:42.438 --> 08:46.364
Yes, Sandra Bullock. We're such
good friends, I call her Sandy, so-

08:46.484 --> 08:48.703
No, Sandy who works at Lily's preschool.
Oh, yeah.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.198
You know, she got engaged. No!

08:51.322 --> 08:52.915
To the gay boyfriend?
Totally.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.914
Oh, how
does she not see it?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.333
If I was with somebody that gorgeous,
I'd overlook a few quirks too.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.880
First of all, thank you.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.834
Second of all,
point well taken.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.839
Mmm, poor Sandy.
I feel so bad for her.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.137
It's better than being alone.
Is it?

09:06.212 --> 09:07.759
She's looking over here.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.512
Oh, my God.
Mitchell you're sitting on the button.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.093
No. No, I'm not.
No, I'm not!

09:11.176 --> 09:13.224
It's stuck! And you're the
one that had it last,

09:13.344 --> 09:15.472
when you were taunting the cheese shop.
Oh, please. You know what?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.649
If you advertise truffle cheese,
there are certain expectations.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.442
Hi, Sandy.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.484
I'm calling on behalf
of Claire Dunphy.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.066
Sure. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay, whatever.
What a beautiful name.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.277
I'm calling on behalf of Claire
Dunphy for town council.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.032
All right,
how about this?

09:30.111 --> 09:31.533
If you vote
for Claire Dunphy,

09:31.613 --> 09:34.708
you won't have to pay taxes
for the rest of your life.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.206
Vote for Claire.

09:37.285 --> 09:40.004
Luke, what are you doing?
You can't say that.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.880
Oh, like she'd be the first politician
to make a promise she can't keep.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.381
Well, maybe I don't want
to talk to you either.

09:46.461 --> 09:50.182
Maybe you are the one that is bothering me!
How do you like that, huh?

09:50.256 --> 09:53.556
Gloria, I'm going to
have to ask you again ...

09:53.635 --> 09:55.763
to please
stick to your script.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.644
But everybody's saying no to me.
I don't get it.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.727
Usually, when I ask someone
to do something, they just do it.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.154
Maybe it's because
these people can't see you.

10:04.229 --> 10:08.780
I don't like it. Can't you just
hook me up to some sort of camera?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.781
Uh-huh. Thank you,
Maggie, for the vote.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.454
Okay. Bye-DY'?-

10:14.489 --> 10:15.911
Here's your seat.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.334
Thank you.
Um, you have to excuse me.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.253
I'm a little nervous. I've never
been on the radio before.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.706
Don't worry about it.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.504
Just think of it as a conversation.
Okay.

10:24.582 --> 10:28.303
Here are your headphones. Volume control.
Don't get too far from the mic.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.296
Okay. Make sure your
cell phone's off.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.425
Oh, cell phone, right. And
you're not chewing gum, are you?

10:33.508 --> 10:37.012
No, I'm not. I just had some
temporary dental work done.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.597
The last thing-
Ohh!

10:40.348 --> 10:44.398
And welcome back to A Matter Of Record.
I'm Cecil Van Gundy.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.813
Joining us now
in studio ...

10:46.896 --> 10:51.777
is District 43 town council
candidate Claire Dunphy.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.654
Thank you, Cecil.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.532
It's a pleasure
to be here.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.789
So, you're a first-time candidate.
Tell us what got you involved.

11:00.869 --> 11:04.874
It all started with
a, um- a stop sign.

11:04.956 --> 11:08.711
I was concerned about safety
in our neighborhood ...

11:08.793 --> 11:12.969
and I was not getting any
satisfaction from city hall.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.765
What's wrong
with Mom?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.343
Oh, this isn't good.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.890
She sounds drunk.
That's not her drunk voice.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.974
And tell us about some of the
other issues facing our town.

11:22.056 --> 11:26.653
Where do you stand on the city's
sewage and sustainability initiative?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.571
The so-called S.S.I.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.569
One cannot really talk about ...

11:30.648 --> 11:32.992
s-s-sewage and sustainability ...

11:33.067 --> 11:36.071
without first discussing recycling.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.370
This city can do more with its recycling program.
What the hell's wrong with her?

11:39.449 --> 11:41.872
- She sounds drunk.
- It's a tooth thing.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.578
Uh-oh.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.172
What's wrong? I'm almost out of air.
Oh, boy.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.342
- Is it serious?
- ls oxygen serious?

11:49.417 --> 11:52.091
You know what? I lost a ton
of time getting your glasses.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.720
I'm gonna drop you at home. You can get
your air, I can drive other people.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.516
I don't have
any more tanks at home.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.515
Why? That seems like
bad planning.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.517
Well, I forgot
to order them.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.724
My pills
make me forget things.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.729
Oh, shoot!
I gotta take my pill!

12:05.850 --> 12:08.103
Please tell me you have it with you.
Of course I do.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.188
But I have to take it
with food. Don't I?

12:10.313 --> 12:13.658
Are you asking me? Uh, yes.
I do take them with food.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.280
I don't feel so well.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.283
Okay, I'll get you
whatever you want.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.285
I'll get you the air!
I'll get you the food!

12:19.364 --> 12:21.207
Then I'll vote for
your drunk wife.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.535
That is not
her drunk voice!

12:23.618 --> 12:26.371
Thank you so much
for voting.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.832
Thanks so much.
We appreciate it.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.046
Hi. I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me.
Jay Pritchett.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.130
Uh, can I get in and out really quick?
Thank you.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.975
Wait, no. You have- Sir! This is all I need.
Thank you very much.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.303
All right.
Claire, Claire, Claire.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.139
Claire, Claire-
Aha! Here!

12:45.473 --> 12:46.895
Oh!

12:46.975 --> 12:49.148
- Hey!
- Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.651
Hello, Dottie!

12:55.692 --> 12:57.239
Jay!

12:57.318 --> 12:59.036
It's so nice to see you.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.247
Is it? Oh, why wouldn't it be?

13:01.364 --> 13:02.741
Well-
Oh.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.794
That was a long time ago. Water
under the bridge. We're good.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.418
- Oh, that's great.
- Thank you so much for voting.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.124
You remember
my daughter, Claire.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.084
She's- She's running
for town council.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.304
Oh, isn't that neat?
Yeah, so proud.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.470
So, you're gonna
put it in there, huh?

13:19.549 --> 13:21.802
Oh, yeah, of course. Definitely.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.807
'Cause every vote counts,
you know.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.435
Thank you so much
for voting.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.606
Yeah.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.400
Boy, I'd sure
like to see ...

13:29.475 --> 13:31.978
the sweet sight
of my vote counting.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.649
Why would I say I'd do
something and not do it?

13:35.732 --> 13:37.359
That would make me a liar,

13:37.442 --> 13:39.820
instead of a trusting
widow who fell asleep ...

13:39.902 --> 13:42.826
in the warm embrace of a man
who promised to make breakfast.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.203
Okay, there it is.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.331
Look, I'm so sorry.

13:47.410 --> 13:52.007
You were the first woman I'd been
with besides my ex in 35 years.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.833
I panicked.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.341
A-A-And it wasn't 'cause you weren't
pretty naked or anything like that.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.172
I'd have run
from Angie Dickinson.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.507
Lucky her.
Dottie-

14:00.631 --> 14:02.008
Good-bye, Jay.
Dottie, Dottie.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.264
Please. I'm just tryin'
to get my ballot in the box.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.142
Oh, yeah!
That sounds familiar.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.643
You don't have to do anything.
Just let me put it in.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.566
Shouldn't have said that.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.523
We are so sorry.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.732
We did not mean for you
to hear any of that.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.283
Yes. And we shouldn't have been
gossiping in the first place.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.158
What if you're right?
What if Gregory is gay?

14:22.236 --> 14:24.910
When my mom said it, I didn't believe her.
She lives in Iowa.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.786
But coming from you two- Means nothing.
We barely know your fiancé.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.667
If he says he's straight,
he's straight.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.625
We're getting married in a month.
People are flying in.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.176
He signed us up for dance
classes- Oh, my God.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.719
No. No, no, no.
Hey.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.305
This is what gays do. We gossip.
Yeah. We gossip a lot.

14:41.422 --> 14:45.052
He gossips! No, no. You're
missing the point. Okay?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.727
We see a great-looking
guy like Gregory,

14:46.803 --> 14:49.352
and we say he's gay because
we want him to be gay.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.395
Really? Really? Are you sure?
Yes.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.943
Absolutely. Look at what
we do with movie stars.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.067
You know? Hugh Jackman.
He sings, he dances, he's dreamy.

14:57.188 --> 15:00.237
So obviously we would want him on our team.
Mmm!

15:00.316 --> 15:01.989
But he's straight.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.991
Trust me. I know.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.993
I said hello to him once
in a restaurant,

15:06.072 --> 15:08.916
and there was absolutely
no chemistry.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.831
Well, if that isn't proof-

15:10.910 --> 15:13.083
Three weeks later, Sandy
and Gregory got married,

15:13.162 --> 15:15.256
and everyone said the
wedding was beautiful.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.958
Gregory did the flowers.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.678
Which is perfectly normal
for a straight guy.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.601
The Greeks do one thing
right, and it's lamb.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.519
All right, let's go vote.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.640
Why the hell does your wife want to be
a politician anyway? You heard her.

15:31.722 --> 15:35.067
She wanted to put up a stop sign at Bristol
and Greenleaf, but then she ran into-

15:35.143 --> 15:37.362
Wait, wait, wait.
That's near where I live.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.155
Yeah! We're neighbors.
Let's go.

15:39.230 --> 15:42.905
No way I'm votin' for that.
Too much government already.

15:42.984 --> 15:47.660
I didn't fight a war so some politician
can tell me where I have to stop my car.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.490
You don't even drive!

15:49.574 --> 15:52.043
That's 'cause that Barack Obama
took my license away.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.837
I don't think he was involved
in the decision!

15:54.912 --> 15:58.257
I left the house today to get 50 votes for my wife.
I'm not going home with zero.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.802
The least you can do is walk right in
there and punch a hole for the woman ...

16:01.878 --> 16:04.802
who drags your garbage can
up your driveway every Tuesday!

16:04.881 --> 16:07.680
I don't like it.
Goes against everything I believe in.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.511
- Really? A stop sign?
- But I'll do it.

16:10.595 --> 16:14.441
'Cause you're a good kid,
and I had a nice day.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.688
Till you started yelling at me.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.486
So sorry.
Thank you.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.939
Here you go.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.866
You know, my wife
was an alcoholic too.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.614
Okay.
Let's just go vote.

16:25.693 --> 16:29.163
The polls are closed
for the District 43 town council race-

16:29.238 --> 16:30.911
Hi, everyone!

16:32.783 --> 16:34.501
Any news?
Not yet, not yet.

16:34.577 --> 16:38.172
But even if I lose, at least now
I know I have a future in radio.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.966
I couldn't.
People need to see me.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.965
Before we hear the results,

16:43.044 --> 16:46.924
I just want to thank you all for
everything you've done for me.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.929
Mitch and Cam,

16:49.008 --> 16:52.353
for campaigning for me all day
in your little Claire-mobile.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.476
It's the least
we could do.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.148
Literally.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.398
We probably did more for Hugh Jackman's
career than we did for Claire's.

16:59.477 --> 17:04.324
And Manny and Gloria, thank you
for making all those phone calls.

17:04.397 --> 17:07.242
And Dad,
for all your support.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.117
I don't think I convinced
anyone to vote for Claire.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.914
I don't think I even voted.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.117
And my husband.

17:16.202 --> 17:21.584
Who drove around I don't know how many
senior citizens today to the polls.

17:22.415 --> 17:23.508
One.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.586
And my beautiful children,

17:25.670 --> 17:30.301
whose faith has given me the confidence
to believe that I can do this.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.722
I can- Oh!
Somebody else answer it.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.720
It's- I lost. I can feel it.
Mom. Mom.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.898
Answer the phone.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.396
Hello.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.103
This is she.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.063
Mm-hmm.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.696
Thanks so much for calling.
Bye-bye.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.164
I have some bad news.

17:54.615 --> 17:58.461
Because someone's gonna be busy
now that she's a councilwoman?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.047
No, no, no!

18:01.122 --> 18:03.545
No, I wasn't doing that fake thing.
I really lost. I lost.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.503
Ay, no.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.385
- That's all right.
- I'm so sorry.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.431
But you know what?

18:11.507 --> 18:14.602
We are still
just so proud of you.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.105
Yeah.

18:18.180 --> 18:22.151
I don't know about you, but, um,
I could use a glass of wine.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.861
Now you're gonna
hear her drunk voice.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.778
Hmm.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.075
Mom.
Mmm?

18:34.155 --> 18:37.034
- You okay?
- Yes, fine. I'm good. I'm fine.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.835
I'm not fine.
I wanted to win, and-

18:39.910 --> 18:41.583
and I'm so embarrassed.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.968
Everybody out there
worked so hard for me ...

18:47.043 --> 18:48.920
and they believed in me,

18:49.003 --> 18:50.471
and I let 'em down.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.682
Oh! Honey.
Oh, sweetheart.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.855
Well, don't cry.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.689
I'm gonna be fine, sweetie.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.608
Really, I am.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.482
Just knowing you care
so much makes me feel better.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.188
No.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.571
I got four rejection letters
I never told you guys about.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.780
What?

19:14.862 --> 19:18.241
I got rejected from UCSB,
Oregon, Wisconsin-

19:18.366 --> 19:19.788
Oh, no.
Northwestern.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.837
Well, we were overshooting
on that one.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.001
What about, uh-
Came today.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.251
My last chance.
Mm-hmm.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.632
I'm too scared
to open it.

19:30.711 --> 19:35.933
Whatever it says in there, your father
and I are crazy proud of you. Okay?

19:36.050 --> 19:38.974
I did start trying this year.
I know you did.

19:39.053 --> 19:41.727
You did. You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.559
Neither do you.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.066
Mmm.
It's a little bit different.

19:48.145 --> 19:51.319
No, it's exactly
the same.

19:51.399 --> 19:55.700
Except you tried really hard the
whole time, not just at the end.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.783
You're right.
It is the same.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.084
We have nothing to be ashamed of.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.787
So let's open that together.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.214
Yeah, open it.
What? No.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.384
- What are you doing here?
- No, come on, Haley. We believe in you.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.674
Do it!  You
can always work for me.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.843
You can do it.
Come on, Haley.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.425
All right, open,
open, open, open.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.895
"Dear Ms. Dunphy,
we regret to inform you-"

20:25.015 --> 20:26.517
Oh, honey.
Mm-hmm.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.399
"While we cannot offer you
admission at this time,

20:29.478 --> 20:32.948
you are a promising candidate, and therefore
we would like to place you on our wait list."

20:33.023 --> 20:35.151
Oh, my God,
I got wait-listed!

20:35.234 --> 20:37.612
We will take it!

20:37.737 --> 20:40.240
Haley!
Congratulations!

20:40.322 --> 20:42.495
Our daughter might be
going to college!

20:48.789 --> 20:50.632
Phil! Look!

20:52.293 --> 20:55.638
- A stop sign.
- It's addressed to you.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.553
"Dear Claire,
I won, you lost.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.980
Here is your stupid
stop sign.

21:05.055 --> 21:08.605
Next time you think about bothering
me, please take its advice.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.028
Your councilman,
the Honorable Duane Bailey."

21:11.103 --> 21:13.447
- Blaaah!
- Honey, you did it!

21:13.522 --> 21:17.322
I did it. I made our
neighborhood a little bit safer.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.654
I may even have saved a life.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.334
You idiot! There's a stop sign!
Can't you read?

21:26.744 --> 21:28.166
We need speed bumps.
No.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.168
Mmm. No. No! Honey!

21:35.044 --> 21:36.045
