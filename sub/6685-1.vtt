00:33.117 --> 00:35.410
You're not
concentrating. I can tell.

00:35.494 --> 00:40.456
You're thinking about e-mails
or text messages or handbags.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.375
Taylor Lautner.

00:42.459 --> 00:45.670
You don't know that. You don't
know what I'm thinking about.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.879
Lautner.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.881
Okay, I might not
know the specifics

00:48.966 --> 00:50.883
but I know it's some
kind of useless racket

00:50.968 --> 00:52.552
that's keeping you
from concentrating.

00:52.636 --> 00:53.720
You don't know squat!

00:53.804 --> 00:56.139
I could be thinking about
the cure for cancer.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.641
In fact, I may have
just cracked it.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.728
And now you're trying to get me
to erase it from my hard drive.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.312
You couldn't cure a UTI

01:03.439 --> 01:05.147
if you owned a cranberry farm.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.025
Hey! I have never had
an infected urinary tract.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.694
- Oh, really?
- No, I have not.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.404
And you've never
had HPV either?

01:11.488 --> 01:12.697
- No!
- All right.

01:12.781 --> 01:13.906
No human papillomavirus?

01:13.991 --> 01:15.074
Watch your mouth!

01:15.159 --> 01:16.534
- Hey!
- Watch your mouth.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.494
- I smack too.
- I was vaccinated.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.121
I was vaccinated.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.040
'Cause, unlike you, I was
born after the polio vaccine.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.209
What are you talking about? I
am five years older than you.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.419
How do I know that?

01:26.503 --> 01:29.922
I see no documentation of that.
For all I know you're 45.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.426
Listen to me!
I am 35 years old. Okay?

01:33.510 --> 01:35.428
You're 45! You're gray!

01:35.512 --> 01:37.054
Buddy, don't grab my hair.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.348
It's thin. I don't like
when you pull my hair.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.309
Then let go of my wrist.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.643
Okay.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.437
- On three.
- Truce? Okay.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.939
Three, two, one.
One, two, three.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.483
Okay. Don't grab my
hair again, okay?

01:48.567 --> 01:50.026
Okay. Well, then
don't hold me down.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.445
- It makes me self-conscious.
- That's my only way to defend myself.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.197
I'm being serious though.
Will you please concentrate?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.907
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.534
That's it.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.370
Take three deep breaths.

02:10.506 --> 02:14.008
This is the only moment
you need to be worried about.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.344
There's no yesterday.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.346
There's no tomorrow.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.389
There's just right now.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.600
You're not late for anything.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.894
And you're not
gonna miss anything.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.272
You're exactly where
you're supposed to be.

02:29.525 --> 02:32.443
And you're exactly who
you're supposed to be.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.571
You're absolutely perfect.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.491
And whatever happens today

02:38.575 --> 02:41.202
is exactly what's
supposed to happen.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.873
And if you want.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.919
I'll spend every moment with
you for the rest of your life.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.050
Okay, I want.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.105
You're gonna have
a wonderful day today.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.190
You don't have to be
nervous about anything.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.733
Okay, I'm not.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.026
You promise?

03:14.111 --> 03:16.946
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.119
You're so terrible on the eyes.

03:23.203 --> 03:27.039
I don't know why I share a bed with you!
You're disgusting!

03:30.669 --> 03:34.505
That's a lot! That's a lot of space.
Forget it. I've got a friend.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.549
Hey, you! Is Charlie awake yet?

03:36.633 --> 03:38.551
'Cause I've got to pick him up.
We've got a meeting in town.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.886
I thought I'd
swing by and grab him.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.053
Yeah, he's inside.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.805
Right. You doing all right?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.724
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good!

03:44.808 --> 03:46.309
Are you okay, Randy?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.603
No. No. Why? Why? What's wrong?

03:48.687 --> 03:51.230
You're just a little sweaty.
But it's not a big deal.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.733
Okay, well, I'm sorry.
That happens.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.484
I hate it.
You don't need to apologize.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.861
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:57.321 --> 03:58.446
Bye, Randy.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.864
You too!

04:00.699 --> 04:02.909
Yes. I'll do that. I'll...

04:02.993 --> 04:05.286
Someone's calling. Hold on, hold on.
Just a second.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.038
God damn it! Son of a bitch.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.169
Damn it!

04:13.795 --> 04:15.796
Oh, shit! Fuck!

04:16.005 --> 04:17.632
Hey. Hey. No!

04:18.175 --> 04:20.593
Fuck! No! No!

04:36.026 --> 04:39.111
No! Kids!

04:39.738 --> 04:41.030
Oh, God!

04:47.788 --> 04:49.747
What the fuck!

04:53.627 --> 04:54.710
Mom!

04:55.003 --> 04:56.253
Oh, no! Kids!

04:56.338 --> 04:57.421
- Mom!
- No!

05:02.177 --> 05:05.471
When I tell you to stay in
park you fucking stay in park!

05:05.555 --> 05:07.640
You stay in park
or I will break you!

05:07.724 --> 05:08.933
Hear me?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.643
Hey! What are you doing?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.478
What the fuck are
you doing, Randy?

05:12.562 --> 05:13.604
Nothing!

05:13.689 --> 05:15.648
What do you mean nothing?
I look out my window

05:15.732 --> 05:17.858
and you're ghost riding your
van in the backyard, man!

05:17.943 --> 05:19.568
You're blasting
holes in everything!

05:19.653 --> 05:22.822
Shut the fuck up, Charlie!
Shut the fuck up!

05:23.407 --> 05:26.575
I'm sorry, ma'am. Wait! Let
me get my badge! Don't worry!

05:26.660 --> 05:29.260
No! Don't go anywhere! I got my badge!
This car is malfunctioning!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.664
Randy! You blew her window out!

05:31.748 --> 05:33.332
You've got to be
more careful than that!

05:33.417 --> 05:36.457
Would you shut the fuck up? I'm trying
to explain to this lady what happened!

05:36.503 --> 05:38.212
Hey! Why don't you
explain to me, man?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.464
It's my yard
you're driving through!

05:40.549 --> 05:43.884
You're assaulting a minivan with a firearm?
Jesus, Randy!

05:43.969 --> 05:45.344
I had a fucking accident!

05:45.429 --> 05:49.348
Okay? I had a fucking accident!
All right? I'm embarrassed!

05:49.433 --> 05:52.393
Okay? Are you happy? I spilt
my coffee all over me!

05:52.477 --> 05:54.437
Listen, I didn't know
you spilt your coffee, okay?

05:54.438 --> 05:56.689
Yeah, it spilt on
my shirt and on my pants!

05:56.773 --> 06:00.151
I'm sorry. Listen, it's all right.
Are you okay?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.029
Yeah. I think so.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.405
So you spilt your coffee?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.657
Yeah. I spilled it on
my shirt and on my pants.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.951
And then you fell
out of your van?

06:09.036 --> 06:12.538
Or were you firing first
and then you fell out?

06:12.956 --> 06:15.082
I don't want to
talk about it out here.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.375
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.585
You want to come inside?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.211
Get me out of this yard, man!

06:19.838 --> 06:21.380
You were really
firing that gun, man.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.840
Okay. Next subject.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.552
Hi, Annie. Take a seat.
I'm just finishing this up.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.512
- Thanks.
- Oh, take your time.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.398
What's that?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.985
I was just taking
a couple of deep breaths.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.404
Someone recommended
I try it when I'm nervous.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.822
You know what else works?

06:46.907 --> 06:49.450
Xanax. Oh. It's so good.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.701
All benzos, really.

06:50.786 --> 06:53.287
But that one works extremely well.
Very fast-acting.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.331
I never take Xanax.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.416
Well, you should really try it.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.461
If you mix it with wine or beer
it sort of supercharges it.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.004
I should try that.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.173
Why are you nervous?

07:04.549 --> 07:08.552
I know, you know, it's
the end of the semester

07:08.637 --> 07:10.262
and I also know
there's budgetary issues.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.765
And that you have to
let a few professors go.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.183
And so when I got
the note in my box,

07:14.267 --> 07:17.394
I think I just
assumed the worst.

07:17.479 --> 07:21.023
Would you be afraid to get fired
if your job was to clean the floor

07:21.108 --> 07:23.400
at one of those coin-operated
jack-off booths?

07:23.485 --> 07:25.402
You know, where you're
the one holding the mop.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.489
Fired from a jack-off booth?

07:28.573 --> 07:30.116
Where the truckers
go and masturbate.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.242
They're all
along the interstate.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.576
Yeah. I know what
you're talking about.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.120
Well? Would you?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.705
No. I would not.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.959
And yet, you're here
at Milton Valley,

07:40.043 --> 07:41.836
the jack-off booth of academia.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.420
I'm not sure
what your point is.

07:43.505 --> 07:47.091
You're too smart and passionate to work here.
So why do you?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.385
You know, I created
my own major at Stanford.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.263
I have a doctorate in Non-Violent
Conflict Resolution,

07:52.347 --> 07:55.224
which no university offers as a major.
They just don't.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.977
So I teach intro
to soc classes.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.147
And I'm... I'm also
in a relationship here.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.356
I'm going to stop you.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.526
UC is starting a conflict
resolution program.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.737
I spoke to the head of
the Sociology Department.

08:09.239 --> 08:13.701
And she's extremely interested in
hiring you to run that program.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.286
No way.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.328
Way.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.413
Now, she's meeting the other
applicant on Wednesday

08:18.456 --> 08:20.082
and she'll need to
make a decision that day.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.458
Their semester
starts in a week.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.575
You're meeting
her on Wednesday.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.588
Oh, my God!

08:27.215 --> 08:28.841
Thank you so much!
I'm so flattered

08:28.925 --> 08:30.509
that you would
even consider me!

08:30.594 --> 08:34.096
I just have to check with my
boyfriend Charlie because he has...

08:34.222 --> 08:37.057
- He can't exactly leave Milton.
- Annie.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.518
Please. I went to state school.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.520
I went to football games and
blacked out and got date raped.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.774
I had abortions. I worried too much
about what my boyfriends thought.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.651
I got what I deserved.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.695
But that's not you.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.156
You deserve
so much more than this.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.534
I hope your
neighbor doesn't report

08:55.619 --> 08:57.119
what happened out
there in the yard.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.080
Why? You're a marshal. You're allowed
to fire your weapon, aren't you?

09:00.165 --> 09:03.751
Yeah, but I've had
a couple incidences.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.463
And this would be bad.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.548
Although, I don't know what
more they could do to me.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.509
This seems like the bottom of the
barrel as far as being a marshal.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.012
Why did you get stuck
with witness protection?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.765
Because I accidentally
discharged my weapon.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.060
Once at a gas station and another
time at a baseball game.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.312
- At a baseball game?
- Yes.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.480
Was anyone killed?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.524
No! Nobody. Are you kidding me?
No! It wasn't even my fault!

09:27.609 --> 09:28.776
I'm not kidding you.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.402
You shoot your weapon
off at a baseball game

09:30.487 --> 09:31.647
and there's people everywhere.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.156
It's not crazy that I would
assume maybe someone got shot.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.658
Listen, I asked for a revolver.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.369
A revolver has a hammer
that you pull back.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.288
- And a safety. But no. What do they give me?
- Right.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.666
Jesus Christ, man.
Be careful with that.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.334
Yeah. Look at that.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.754
- Okay.
- Now, you heard stuff going on. I mean...

09:50.590 --> 09:52.007
I don't know.
That's not even safe.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.509
Randy, Randy, Randy, Randy.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.344
Please, please,
please, please! Okay?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.264
I'll just...

09:58.348 --> 10:02.142
From now on, don't touch
my weapon anymore. Okay?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.103
- Listen, I wasn't...
- I know we're friends and everything.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.772
And it's kind of a gray area
now that we are friends.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.108
But do not touch my weapon again.
It's unsafe.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.192
Okay. I'm sorry.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.358
I've been trained for this.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.162
I trained for two years
to be able to do this.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.155
- Okay.
- So please, do me a solid.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.991
I'm not going to touch it.
I won't bring it up again.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.784
- I promise. I'm not going to touch it.
- All right, thank you.

10:18.868 --> 10:19.910
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.453
And it's not
your fault. I know.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.903
Oh, no. Did it not go good?

10:55.405 --> 10:57.656
No, it went really well.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.326
Then why are you upset?

11:00.410 --> 11:03.078
You just look so
stupid sitting there.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.332
So impossibly cute.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.792
And I don't even know
why you like me so much.

11:09.085 --> 11:12.254
Oh, mama.
I think you're stupid.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.301
I should have oiled that.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.892
So she didn't fire you?

11:26.895 --> 11:31.023
Debby found me a job where I
could head my own department.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.691
In my field.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.816
And it would be the first
one like it in the country.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.821
And it would be perfect.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.033
Then why are you upset?

11:41.785 --> 11:44.244
Because it's in L.A.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.624
And I would have to
leave and move to L.A.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.252
It's in L.A.?

11:52.962 --> 11:55.964
That's the only place
this job exists? In L.A.?

11:56.508 --> 11:57.633
No other place?

11:57.759 --> 11:59.885
No, Charlie.
There's no other place.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.096
It only exists in L.A.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.517
And Debby told me that if I
didn't take the interview

12:06.601 --> 12:08.143
she would fire me.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.438
And I wouldn't even
have my job here anymore.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.175
Will you say something, please?

12:40.635 --> 12:43.220
What do you want me to say?
There's nothing to say.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.098
Well, what are you thinking?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.641
What am I thinking?

12:47.809 --> 12:50.644
I think I'm pissed that the one
thing that makes me happy,

12:50.728 --> 12:54.606
the one thing that makes this
shit-hole town bearable is leaving.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.778
I didn't say I was leaving.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.281
You're leaving!

13:02.365 --> 13:04.992
Even if you wanted to
stay, I wouldn't let you.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.287
I wouldn't forgive myself
and you wouldn't either.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.960
That's not true. If I stayed
I wouldn't resent you.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.649
Hey. Where are you going?

13:37.734 --> 13:38.942
I'm gonna go talk to Debby.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.611
About what?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.280
I'm gonna beg her to let
me have my job back.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.449
Okay, wait. Slow down a second.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.159
Are you sure
you want to do this?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.953
If I wanted to go to L.A.,
I'd have to be outside

13:50.038 --> 13:52.206
packing my car up to
get there by Wednesday.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.500
Yeah?

13:54.584 --> 13:57.211
Yeah. So you don't see me
packing up my car, do you?

13:57.295 --> 13:59.421
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.341
This doesn't feel right.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.384
I'll be back in an hour or two.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.340
You have been dating
this clown for one year.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.426
It's only going to take you
six months to get over him.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.096
Now, I want you to take one of
these when it gets unbearable.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.015
Some Xanies in here.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.560
And Lorazepam. Dilaudid.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.727
My gift to you.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.688
Debby, I don't need it.
I don't need the pills.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.939
Take it!

15:03.653 --> 15:05.946
Look at Captain
Longdick out there.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.157
Does this guy like
to fuck, or what?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.827
That's Charlie!

15:15.498 --> 15:17.332
What are you doing here?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.751
I'm here to take
your fat ass to L.A.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.254
You can't leave.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.381
Yeah.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.826
Look, I can't live
here without you

15:25.883 --> 15:27.050
and I'm not letting you stay.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.011
So I suggest you get in.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.888
You don't think
it'll be too dangerous?

15:31.973 --> 15:36.184
No. I've been gone for four years and L.A.
is a big city.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.103
We'll be fine.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.032
I thought you said
this car didn't run.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.329
Sweetie,
this car more than runs.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.382
Buddy! Where are you going?

16:07.467 --> 16:08.550
To L.A.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.801
I have to pack my stuff.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.470
No. I grabbed
everything you'd want.

16:12.013 --> 16:12.971
Where?

16:13.056 --> 16:14.306
It's in the trunk.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.975
Honey, everything I need for L.A.
would not fit in the trunk.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.645
Sweetie, this car also came
as a hardtop convertible.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.064
The whole roof
slid into the trunk.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.149
The trunk was designed
to hold the entire roof.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.568
Believe me. Your stuff
fit in the trunk.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.782
Oh, wait!

16:31.908 --> 16:34.409
- What?
- My teaching certificate. It's at Gil's.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.829
You're kidding me.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.332
No. And I need it.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.585
Oh, boy.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.099
Be back in a sec.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.604
Oh, my God.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.904
Hey!

17:11.196 --> 17:13.781
Anne? What a fun surprise.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.410
Listen. I think
I accidentally left...

17:16.493 --> 17:19.371
You caught me in the middle
of doing all my laundry.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.623
Sorry about that.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.416
When I split up
the photo albums,

17:23.501 --> 17:25.961
I think I left the one with my
teaching degree here with you.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.255
Okay, well.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.859
That's an honest mistake. You want
to come in and talk about it?

17:30.925 --> 17:34.261
No, Gil. I just want the album.
Can you grab it?

17:34.595 --> 17:40.600
Uno momento.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.478
Nice buns!

17:43.646 --> 17:45.981
Well, it looks like we've got
quite a few options here.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.482
Are you sure you don't want
to do this on the couch?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.443
- We can spread them out...
- No, that's fine. It'll be in the back.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.862
All right. Why, pray tell, are
you in such a hurry to get this?

17:51.946 --> 17:54.573
Because I'm taking a job in L.A.
and I need it.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.242
You're taking a job
in Los Angeles? When?

17:57.326 --> 18:00.746
Now, actually.
We're leaving right now.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.205
We?

18:04.876 --> 18:06.918
You're moving to Los Angeles
with a man you barely know?

18:07.003 --> 18:07.961
Bingo. Okay...

18:08.045 --> 18:09.045
Hold on a second!

18:09.130 --> 18:10.650
I'm not letting you
move 500 miles away

18:10.673 --> 18:12.841
with a man named Charles
Bronson, who you barely know

18:12.925 --> 18:15.761
who happens to be in the
witness protection program.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.637
Do you know who goes
into witness protection?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.598
Criminals.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.434
Criminals who have ratted out other
criminals to save their own ass.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.811
Okay! First of all, I never should
have told you anything about him.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.773
I never should have. Secondly,
you don't have the authority

18:27.857 --> 18:29.775
to not let me do anything, Gil.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.569
And lastly, he was given that
name when he entered protection

18:32.653 --> 18:34.905
which he entered because
he witnessed a crime. Okay?

18:34.989 --> 18:37.574
He's a good Samaritan, Gil.
Not a criminal. Give me!

18:37.658 --> 18:40.118
You can't just disappear with that scumbag.
All right? It's unacceptable.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.286
He's probably
going to murder you

18:41.370 --> 18:42.370
and role-play with your corpse!

18:42.497 --> 18:44.738
- Give me the album, Gil! Give me the album!
- Annie. Annie!

18:44.749 --> 18:46.875
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing, Gil?

18:46.959 --> 18:50.295
Nothing. I was just giving her
the albums that she asked for.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.589
You're sunbathing, too?
What, you got your top off?

18:53.883 --> 18:55.133
I was doing laundry.

18:55.218 --> 18:57.093
Give her the
fucking books, all right?

18:57.178 --> 18:58.512
You know what?
You're not safe, Annie.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.931
And when he snaps, you better hope
to hell that I'm there to save you.

19:01.015 --> 19:01.973
Because he's going to do it.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.433
Okay, Gil. Take care.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.102
Bye, Gil!

19:10.399 --> 19:11.525
- You got it?
- Yeah.

19:14.445 --> 19:18.073
G-L-8-7-9. G-L-8-7-9!

19:19.659 --> 19:21.034
What?

19:21.702 --> 19:23.286
What's with this car?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.580
What do you mean
what's with this car?

19:26.082 --> 19:29.835
I mean...
It's kind of obnoxious.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.003
You think this
car is obnoxious?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.964
'Cause I think it's tits!

19:34.382 --> 19:36.842
And I think most people
think this car is tits.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.510
It sounds like
it's gonna break.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.136
No, it does not sound
like it's gonna break.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.347
It sounds like
it has 700 horsepower.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.671
All right? You're being a girl.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.976
Believe me, all dudes
love how this car sounds.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.022
I'm in a 700
horsepower dude lure?

19:51.107 --> 19:52.148
That's right.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.859
Apologies. I had no idea.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.444
You definitely told me
this car was broken.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.364
It was when I was talking about
turning the shed into a craft room.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.615
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.867
So, why did you say that?

20:01.951 --> 20:03.159
Why did I say that?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.871
Holy shnikes, look at this.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.206
There's a parrot
driving this car.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.625
A driving parrot!

20:10.710 --> 20:12.836
Oh, man! I'm gonna be rich!

20:12.920 --> 20:15.046
I found the only
driving parrot!

20:15.131 --> 20:16.464
I was hiding it in the shed

20:16.549 --> 20:18.216
'cause you're not supposed
to bring anything with you.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.510
I mean, especially not a car.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.430
But I spent a year and a half
building this thing with my dad

20:23.514 --> 20:26.474
and I didn't want to
just not have it anymore.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.521
You wanted to bring it because
you built it with your dad?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.648
Yeah.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.067
We weren't the
hottest communicators,

20:36.152 --> 20:38.653
but we kind of
worked well together.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.573
So he was into off-road racing
and we did that together.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.701
And then he was into building
old cars and we did that.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.329
I think it's sweet.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.332
I want a burger.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.918
I want a burger too.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.294
Let's get some beef!

20:54.503 --> 20:56.546
Let's get some beef up in us.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.468
What are you doing?

21:01.552 --> 21:03.511
I'm on my Pouncer app.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.263
Yeah. I understand it's an app.

21:05.348 --> 21:08.266
I'm saying when you hit the
Pouncer app what happens?

21:08.351 --> 21:12.270
I hit Pouncer. And it sends out
my exact location on this map.

21:12.605 --> 21:16.358
And then I can see who else has
Pouncer on the same exact map.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.922
And I can chat with
them in real time.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.278
And be like, "Hey! Where are you?
What's going on?"

21:23.908 --> 21:25.116
You're the only one on here.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.743
Yeah.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.245
Well, we're in the middle of nowhere.
There's no gays.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.956
Have you used it
in another city?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.207
Oh, my God.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.668
Airports. Vegas. You know.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.295
Austin lights up like
a fucking Christmas tree.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.820
A hundred feet away.
Fifty feet away.

21:38.839 --> 21:42.008
Ten feet away. Zero feet away.
Guys wanting to hook up.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.052
For coffee? Or like...

21:44.136 --> 21:45.553
No. To fuck.

21:45.638 --> 21:49.099
Or hand jobs or blowjobs
or kissing. Whatever.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.642
So wait, then like,
you just hit a button

21:50.726 --> 21:52.894
and within five minutes
you and a stranger,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.813
having sex?
Or having hand jobs?

21:54.897 --> 21:55.981
- Yep.
- Okay.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.983
I mean, that's not the
intention of the app.

21:58.067 --> 22:01.736
I think the intention of the app is
to see who's straight and who's gay.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.115
Like for you, you're straight
so it's safe to assume

22:05.199 --> 22:06.866
that you can hit on anyone
or flirt with them.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.661
And then I do that, what happens?
Victim of a hate crime.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.162
Yeah. Not cool.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.330
Not cool at all.

22:12.415 --> 22:13.415
Oh, Gil.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.167
What?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.420
Hey! Did you change your mind?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.005
It doesn't work like that, Gil.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.799
I can't have him tailed or brought in.
He hasn't done anything.

22:22.925 --> 22:26.428
I'm telling you, the guy is a
fucking Ted Bundy. Okay, Terry?

22:26.512 --> 22:29.264
He's probably going to murder her
and do kinky shit to her body!

22:29.348 --> 22:30.765
And that's gonna be on you!

22:30.850 --> 22:32.250
You're supposed to
be a fucking cop!

22:32.268 --> 22:33.727
I am a fucking cop, Gil!

22:33.811 --> 22:35.895
I don't need you telling
me how to be a cop.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.647
I know what I'm
fucking doing, okay?

22:37.732 --> 22:40.108
You know what?
You still owe me 1,700 bucks!

22:40.192 --> 22:42.027
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

22:42.111 --> 22:43.862
I got you out of that DUl.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.281
That report said
you soiled yourself, Gil.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.782
Like a fucking homeless man!

22:47.867 --> 22:49.701
You evacuated.
You shit your pants.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.745
I fixed that! Okay, Gil? Me!

22:51.829 --> 22:54.205
Fine. Forget the 1,700 bucks.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.584
Just do it because
you're my brother. Okay?

22:59.128 --> 23:00.754
Fine. What's the plate number?

23:01.297 --> 23:02.464
Thank you.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.134
Galactica,
Libra, eight, seven, nine.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.428
Galactica, Libra,
eight, seven, nine.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.558
The plate's been
expired for three years.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.477
And it's not even in his name.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.896
What's the name?
Who is it registered to?

23:19.273 --> 23:20.482
Yul Perrkins.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.067
Yul Perrkins?

23:22.151 --> 23:23.526
Yeah.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.738
Oh, my God! I bet
that's his real name!

23:27.281 --> 23:28.656
Yul!

23:28.741 --> 23:30.200
I've got to go.
I'll see you Sunday.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.326
Thanks, Terry!

23:34.246 --> 23:35.872
Yul Perrkins.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.169
"Thirty-one year-old Yul
Perrkins will be the key witness

23:41.253 --> 23:44.255
"in the state's case against
Alexander Dmitri and Noel Hodges.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.007
"Three suspects are
accused of robbing.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.468
"First National Bank
in late August." You fuck.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.178
"They have been awaiting
trial for six months"

23:50.262 --> 23:52.764
"while the state finalized the
plea bargain with Perrkins."

23:53.599 --> 23:55.016
Alexander Dmitri.

24:00.022 --> 24:04.484
For the next 24 hours
I know where Yul Perrkins is.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.266
They're saying the Iraqi dinar

24:36.350 --> 24:38.309
is gonna go to the value
of the Kuwait dollar.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.478
What are you talking
about? Iraqi dinar?

24:40.563 --> 24:43.189
It's trading at 1000
dinar per U.S. dollar.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.401
Oh, shit. It's Randy.
Hold on one second.

24:47.069 --> 24:48.069
Hey, Randy!

24:48.154 --> 24:50.114
Hey. Where are you? I picked
something up for you.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.322
A new bowling ball.

24:51.407 --> 24:52.824
You didn't
have to do that, man.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.669
Well, I was just thinking. You're a
really good bowler, like naturally.

24:55.703 --> 24:58.580
You're too good to be using one
of those pitted-out house balls.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.708
That was really nice of you.
Thanks, Randy.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.418
So when are you
going to be back?

25:03.502 --> 25:06.254
Well... Here's the thing.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.716
Annie got a really great
job opportunity in L.A.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.593
So I'm gonna go
ahead and go with her.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.303
What? Are you
fucking kidding me?

25:13.387 --> 25:14.888
You know you
can't leave Milton!

25:14.972 --> 25:16.514
You cannot leave Milton!

25:16.599 --> 25:18.016
Well, I know it's not advised,

25:18.100 --> 25:19.851
but technically
I think I can leave.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.019
This is such bullshit!

25:21.103 --> 25:23.903
Listen, if you do leave you have to
have a marshal with you at all times

25:23.939 --> 25:25.106
in case something happens!

25:25.191 --> 25:27.231
And if something happens
to you, I am fucking fired!

25:27.234 --> 25:29.277
Hey, look. I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to get you fired, okay?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.029
I'm leaving witness protection.

25:31.113 --> 25:32.906
So I'm no longer
your responsibility.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.699
I mean, I think
I can leave. No?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.367
You can leave.
But there's a whole process.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.369
You've got to
fill out forms and shit.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.788
Okay. Where are you right now?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.081
I'm already on my way.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.125
Just stay right where you're
at and I'm coming to you.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.836
No. No. Listen. Randy. I've got
to get her to this interview.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.755
I would have told
you I was leaving

25:48.839 --> 25:51.382
but this whole thing happened really fast.
And I'm sorry.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.051
I'm on my way. What's your 20?

25:53.135 --> 25:55.345
I'm gonna call you
when we get to L.A. Okay?

25:55.429 --> 25:57.055
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
You just stay there.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.473
What the fuck?

25:59.141 --> 26:00.350
Randy? I got to go, okay?

26:00.434 --> 26:01.601
Stay there! I'm coming.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.978
Fuck! All right...

26:08.776 --> 26:10.735
Okay, you know what? Randy's
hell bent on protecting me.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.320
And I think that could
be very dangerous for us.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.738
We should get on the road.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.989
Okay.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.079
Hey, chief, is this your car?

26:21.163 --> 26:22.664
Yeah, man. You shouldn't touch.

26:22.748 --> 26:23.998
It's so nice.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.333
Thanks.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.127
I bet this thing's got nitrous.
This got nitrous?

26:28.212 --> 26:31.214
No. Nitrous is for fags.
It's got cubic inches.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.007
Cubic inches.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.020
Did you just say "fags"?

26:46.355 --> 26:47.647
Yeah.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.108
But not in, like,
a homophobic way.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.193
I used it in place of "lame."

26:52.861 --> 26:54.737
Why wouldn't
you just say "lame"?

26:55.864 --> 27:00.076
Well, same reason I say
"fuck" instead of "frick."

27:00.160 --> 27:03.788
It packs more punch. It's basically
the swear word version of lame.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.081
No. It's not.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.167
It's a hate word used
to perpetuate homophobia.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.378
It's used to
marginalize gay people.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.547
You're acting like
you don't know me.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.590
I voted to
legalize civil unions.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.302
When I had friends,
I had a lot of gay friends.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.761
Then you shouldn't say "fag."

27:18.846 --> 27:21.639
I don't! I don't use it in
reference to actual people.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.391
I mean especially
homosexual people.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.727
So then, that makes it okay?

27:26.061 --> 27:30.273
Yeah, I think so. I mean
morally, I feel fine about it.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.086
So as long as it's not in reference
to a person, it's all right?

27:33.819 --> 27:37.572
Like if I wanted to start
calling my purse the N word.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.741
"Honey, have you
seen my N word?

27:39.825 --> 27:42.994
“I can't find my N word anywhere.
And it's the expensive one."

27:43.996 --> 27:45.872
Okay. I will work on it.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.041
Thank you.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.003
Are you fucking kidding me?

27:52.087 --> 27:53.296
No. I'm not.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.965
No, no. Your ex-boyfriend
is behind us.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.884
Gil is tailing us.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.761
Oh, my God.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.679
What the fuck is he doing?

28:01.930 --> 28:04.349
You know what? I'm going to
put a stop to this right now.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.975
What are you gonna do?

28:07.269 --> 28:08.436
I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.854
I'm gonna tell him if he
doesn't stop following us,

28:09.938 --> 28:11.773
I'm gonna pull him out of the car
and beat the shit out of him.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.149
You're not doing that!

28:13.233 --> 28:14.525
That's not how
you solve things.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.361
That's exactly
how you handle this.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.945
Especially with
a turd like Gil.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.199
I'm sorry. Which one of us has a
doctorate in conflict resolution?

28:21.283 --> 28:22.283
'Cause I think it's me.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.910
Listen. I respect
your degree. I do.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.870
But it's not how we're getting
out of this situation, okay?

28:25.954 --> 28:27.594
We don't have time
to bring in a mediator.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.249
Charlie, I am not going to
live with a man who says "fag"

28:30.334 --> 28:32.043
and beats up guys
on the side of the road.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.670
I'm not gonna teach
non-violence at a university

28:34.922 --> 28:36.756
and then marry
Dog the bounty hunter!

28:36.840 --> 28:38.299
I won't do it!

28:56.193 --> 28:57.318
What are you doing, Gil?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.153
Protecting someone I love.

29:00.406 --> 29:03.157
What are you doing,
Yul Perrkins?

29:08.497 --> 29:09.956
I don't know
how you know that name,

29:10.040 --> 29:12.125
but if you say it out loud
again, I swear to God...

29:12.209 --> 29:13.835
"Yul" do what?

29:19.174 --> 29:20.508
I love Annie.

29:21.176 --> 29:23.845
Enough to move back to L.A. for
her where I might get killed.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.764
I love her so much that I'm
not beating your fucking head

29:26.849 --> 29:29.090
against the ground right now
because she asked me not to.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.310
But if you do something that
results in her leaving me,

29:31.395 --> 29:32.937
I'm going to beat you to death.

29:33.021 --> 29:36.190
I'm literally gonna beat you to fucking death, Gil.
Do you understand that?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.861
That name stays
between you and I.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.197
You know we have
a mutual friend?

29:43.365 --> 29:45.116
I mean, technically
he's a Facebook friend,

29:45.200 --> 29:47.481
which is obviously less significant
than a real friendship

29:47.494 --> 29:49.078
but still kind of cool.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.164
Alex Dmitri.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.876
You know him? Alex Dmitri?

30:05.888 --> 30:07.013
I got you.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.561
Thank you.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.897
Thank you so much.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.608
What did he say?
Is he going home?

30:19.735 --> 30:22.612
Nope. No, he's going to
follow us all the way to L.A.

30:24.239 --> 30:27.325
So how do you
want to handle this?

30:28.702 --> 30:30.863
Well, sweetie, if you're not
gonna let me kick his ass,

30:30.913 --> 30:33.247
then you're gonna have
to let me run from him.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.416
Okay.

30:36.126 --> 30:37.293
I'm proud of you.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.837
Thank you.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.839
I'm sure I'll get there.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.008
Yul!

30:44.551 --> 30:46.093
Yul Perrkins!

30:47.262 --> 30:48.513
What is he saying?

30:48.722 --> 30:50.348
Oh, who gives a shit?

30:50.766 --> 30:52.975
This is probably gonna
get pretty fucking radical.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.269
But I don't want you
to get scared, okay?

30:55.354 --> 30:58.648
I raced all growing up and I even
drove professionally for a while.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.441
Okay.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.902
I trust you.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.172
Annie, hey! This is Gil!

32:46.506 --> 32:48.049
I'm following you, okay?

32:48.216 --> 32:50.760
If he goes all psycho
and shit on you

32:50.844 --> 32:53.387
give me some kind
of hand signal. Okay?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.102
Hold on!

34:10.966 --> 34:13.300
Shit!

34:17.097 --> 34:19.639
Stop! Stop! Oh, God. Stop!

34:19.725 --> 34:22.810
Holy shit!
I think that was Randy!

34:48.670 --> 34:49.962
Bye, Gil.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.848
Oh, my God.

35:03.185 --> 35:05.019
Hey! Randy?

35:05.687 --> 35:07.354
Randy, are you okay, man?

35:07.898 --> 35:09.940
No! I'm not
fucking okay, Charlie!

35:10.025 --> 35:12.568
I'm in the middle of a field
that you ran me into!

35:12.652 --> 35:16.113
And my gun started going off, man!
No! I am not okay!

35:16.198 --> 35:18.866
Hey! I'm sorry! And I
don't want to be a dick,

35:18.950 --> 35:21.452
but you didn't have to jump
your van onto that field, man.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.579
I got back in my lane
with plenty of time.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.040
Bullshit! I know time.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.667
We would have had
a fucking head-on collision!

35:28.919 --> 35:31.754
Okay. You know what?
You're clearly shaken up.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.965
And apparently you had another
incident with your firearm.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.634
And I think you're
being a little defensive.

35:36.718 --> 35:38.758
I just pulled over to see if you're okay.
All right?

35:38.762 --> 35:41.096
I am not defensive!
Are you shitting me?

35:41.181 --> 35:43.557
What have I got
to be defending?

35:43.642 --> 35:46.519
Nothing to defend!
You ran me off the road!

35:46.603 --> 35:49.313
My gun went off 'cause of
you, almost killing me!

35:49.523 --> 35:50.731
Hey, Randy?

35:51.316 --> 35:52.817
Are you really all right?

35:52.901 --> 35:55.694
I am okay. I am okay. How are you doing?
Are you okay?

35:56.071 --> 35:57.196
Yeah.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.949
Do you want me to
call you a tow truck?

36:00.033 --> 36:01.951
Obviously I have
a fucking cell phone!

36:02.035 --> 36:05.412
I was in the middle of a call
when you wrecked me! Okay?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.331
Okay. Well, you know what...

36:07.415 --> 36:09.667
Wait, Charlie!
Don't go! Don't go, please!

36:09.918 --> 36:12.253
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm just a little embarrassed.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.713
Don't go, okay? 'Cause I'll
just have to chase you.

36:14.798 --> 36:18.300
I know you will, Randy. But will you
please be a little more careful?

36:19.219 --> 36:21.679
I mean, it really worries
me when I look behind me

36:21.763 --> 36:23.806
and I see your van is airborne.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.516
Charlie?

36:26.393 --> 36:27.393
Bye, Randy!

36:27.477 --> 36:29.478
Hey! Congratulations
on the new job!

36:30.105 --> 36:31.188
Thanks!

36:39.406 --> 36:40.531
Remember when they
had, like, two minutes

36:40.615 --> 36:42.032
when they could shop and
get whatever they wanted?

36:42.117 --> 36:43.909
- That's a good idea!
- Oh, hey.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.453
Leave a pit by itself
right in front of a store.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.206
Well he's not a killer.
Look at that face.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.459
That's what they all say.
Until they need stitches.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.802
Like those crazy bitches
that live with tigers?

36:54.963 --> 36:56.630
What? What are
you talking about?

36:56.923 --> 36:57.923
The show!

36:58.008 --> 37:00.759
About the women who get pet
tigers and then get eaten?

37:00.844 --> 37:02.887
Yeah!

37:02.971 --> 37:04.054
What was that called?

37:04.139 --> 37:06.699
You ain't ever gonna catch no black
bitches living with no tiger.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.058
That's some white girl shit.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.727
She hates white bitches, right?

37:09.811 --> 37:11.520
We don't like white
bitches either, do we?

37:11.605 --> 37:12.688
Black people don't do that.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.232
You'll never catch me
doing some shit like that.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.443
Yeah? I live with a tiger
and I ain't no white bitch.

37:17.527 --> 37:18.611
- Oh, really?
- No.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.070
I'm a tiger?

37:20.155 --> 37:21.447
Yes, ma'am.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.590
- Just the water?
- I don't think we have the right cookware for that...

37:25.660 --> 37:27.077
- Just the water?
- Yeah!

37:27.162 --> 37:28.329
That'll be $1 .69.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.165
Oh, just a sec. Hi, boss.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.382
What's up?

37:41.134 --> 37:42.593
Gonna have a hell of a meal.

37:43.637 --> 37:45.220
Well, the dog
food's not for me.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.014
I'm just teasing.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.600
But I don't think your dog's gonna
want to eat that either, though.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.436
He's lucky I feed him anything at
all after he tore up my couch.

37:54.522 --> 37:57.524
See? He ain't no lamb.
He's a tiger.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.861
That's right, girl.
He's all tiger.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.741
Well, maybe he thought
that couch was healthier

38:05.825 --> 38:07.826
than the landfill
you're giving him.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.287
Hey, dude?

38:10.372 --> 38:12.539
How about you stop worrying
about what I feed my dog

38:12.624 --> 38:16.043
and worry about surfboards, or whatever
the fuck it is you think about?

38:16.795 --> 38:18.045
I'm sorry.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.256
I just don't know
if you realize

38:21.341 --> 38:23.133
how much better the good
dog food is for your dog.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.468
Yeah, it's 10% more expensive.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.220
But it's like 80% less poison.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.763
I just...

38:29.182 --> 38:31.262
You trying to get knocked
the fuck out, motherfucker?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.810
No, no, no.

38:32.894 --> 38:34.228
'Cause you got the right guy.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.438
I'll knock a nigger
out holding a baby.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.945
Thank you for
shopping at Field's.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.007
I am really only
thinking about the best.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.826
I'm just thinking about, you know, the
beautiful little creature out there.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.310
But I'm sorry.
Have a nice day, sir.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.165
So, a little dog food?

38:55.250 --> 38:56.291
Yeah. How are you doing?

38:56.376 --> 38:57.418
Good.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.881
Where the fuck is your leash?

39:06.094 --> 39:07.761
That fucking son of a bitch.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.688
Come on, buddy! Yeah!

39:18.648 --> 39:21.150
Get you where we can
play around a little bit.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.193
Yeah! How's that feel?

39:23.445 --> 39:24.778
Right?

39:32.787 --> 39:33.954
All right?

39:35.081 --> 39:36.623
Let's eat some dog food.
All right, buddy?

39:36.708 --> 39:37.708
Chill the fuck out, man!

39:37.792 --> 39:39.376
No, I am chill.

39:39.461 --> 39:40.836
Don't do nothing stupid!

39:40.920 --> 39:43.213
You like this. You want it.
You said you liked it!

39:43.298 --> 39:45.424
You said it's good!
Don't you remember?

39:45.800 --> 39:49.178
It's high-priced fucking chicken feet dog food!
Eat it, brother!

39:49.262 --> 39:50.471
Baby, let's go, okay?

39:50.638 --> 39:51.972
Yo! Get your man straight!

39:52.474 --> 39:54.154
Hey, babe. I'll be there
in a second, okay?

39:54.184 --> 39:56.393
No, man! Get in the car!
It's just dog food!

39:56.478 --> 39:59.229
No! Babe, it's not just dog food.
That's my whole point about this.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.023
It's compressed fucking sawdust

40:01.107 --> 40:03.233
and we're not leaving here
until my man samples some.

40:03.777 --> 40:05.944
You got it! Just eat it!
No! Just trust me!

40:06.029 --> 40:07.196
I can't eat that shit, man!

40:07.280 --> 40:09.280
- Why not?
- I can't! Man, I can't! I'd rather die!

40:09.657 --> 40:11.617
I can't eat this shit, man!

40:12.786 --> 40:14.328
Do you understand
what you just said?

40:14.412 --> 40:16.663
That you would rather
die than eat that shit?

40:16.998 --> 40:18.373
You understand
how that supports

40:18.458 --> 40:20.918
what I've been trying to tell
you the past 15 minutes?

40:21.836 --> 40:23.921
Other people, lives in danger,

40:24.005 --> 40:25.172
they eat another human being.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.590
But you?

40:26.674 --> 40:28.675
You won't even
fucking eat this.

40:34.474 --> 40:36.934
Fuck. That's some
profound shit, man.

40:37.018 --> 40:39.103
That's some
fucking profound shit.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.448
Hey!

40:51.533 --> 40:53.200
Come on. Come on.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.286
Now, I'm going to
take your dog.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.163
But I'm going to
tell you something.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.207
It's not cool to wear
those tank tops anymore.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.712
Unless you're wearing it
ironically or something.

41:10.218 --> 41:11.718
Fuck all y'all!

41:25.733 --> 41:27.067
Fuck me.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.238
Oh, shit. Get some.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.241
Damn!

41:35.243 --> 41:36.994
That's a mean kitty!

41:37.078 --> 41:38.036
Thanks.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.413
What is it? A '75?

41:39.789 --> 41:41.206
'67.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.709
Is that what they told you?

41:44.586 --> 41:46.420
Shit! Suicide doors.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.964
Suicide...

41:49.757 --> 41:51.133
You can shut that.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.926
Thanks.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.344
Seeing if it worked, guy.

41:57.265 --> 41:59.099
That ain't a stock power plant.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.851
No. Not stock.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.769
Yeah. How many ponies?

42:03.771 --> 42:05.355
- Seven hundred.
- Damn!

42:06.524 --> 42:07.858
How much?

42:08.776 --> 42:09.943
It's 700!

42:10.445 --> 42:12.779
No. Into the motor.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.199
What's the price
tag on this build?

42:15.283 --> 42:17.910
Reason I'm asking is 'cause
I might do a motor swap

42:17.994 --> 42:19.494
with that late
model Ford over there.

42:21.623 --> 42:22.664
Yeah.

42:23.291 --> 42:27.336
I can't really remember everything
that went into it. So...

42:28.296 --> 42:29.546
Ballpark it.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.965
You know what?
It was about 14 grand.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.385
Damn. That's commitment.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.346
Yeah.

42:37.639 --> 42:39.389
That's what I always say.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.433
And the South will rise again.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.186
God! You own that too?

42:44.604 --> 42:47.189
You know what?
It's a rental, actually.

42:48.483 --> 42:49.566
Aren't they all?

42:57.158 --> 43:01.745
Hey. Have you noticed that there
is a certain type of person

43:01.829 --> 43:03.997
that is attracted
to this vehicle?

43:05.833 --> 43:07.751
Yeah. Like the guy
at the gas station?

43:07.835 --> 43:10.545
Yes. Like the guy
at the gas station.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.757
Like, if you spent two years
building your dream car

43:13.841 --> 43:15.133
and then you started to notice

43:15.218 --> 43:19.054
that is was also the dream car
of a certain type of person.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.807
Like people who are...
I don't know.

43:21.891 --> 43:25.143
Let's just call them
rapists, out of convenience.

43:25.228 --> 43:28.563
If you started to notice that
your peers were rapists,

43:28.648 --> 43:32.025
what do you think that says about
the old you who built this car?

43:33.486 --> 43:35.237
Look. This car
is designed specific.

43:35.321 --> 43:38.657
What appeals to me is probably not
what appeals to other dudes. Okay?

43:38.741 --> 43:41.952
I wanted something that was as
fast as hell, seated six people,

43:42.036 --> 43:44.579
and had a trunk
the size of an SUV's.

43:44.664 --> 43:45.872
But why?

43:46.749 --> 43:50.127
I feel like you're insinuating that I
have small dick complex or something.

43:50.211 --> 43:52.129
And I don't. We both
know that's not the case.

43:52.213 --> 43:53.839
I have a lot of issues,
but not that one.

43:53.923 --> 43:55.132
I'm just teasing you.

43:55.216 --> 43:56.967
I don't think couples can
really tease each other.

43:57.051 --> 43:58.260
I think everyone
pretends they can,

43:58.344 --> 43:59.678
but really, there's
always some kind of

43:59.762 --> 44:01.430
truth or judgment
in there somewhere.

44:01.514 --> 44:03.598
Baloney. Couples can tease.

44:03.683 --> 44:05.309
- Oh, yeah.
- It's playful!

44:05.393 --> 44:08.353
Well, of course. I can say
to you you're too fat,

44:08.438 --> 44:10.314
or you're too tall
and clearly I'm joking.

44:10.398 --> 44:13.650
But anything else I say I'm
probably hinting at something

44:13.735 --> 44:14.860
that bothers me about you.

44:14.944 --> 44:17.654
But I'm framing it as a joke,
so that when a fight ensues

44:17.739 --> 44:19.865
I don't have to take
responsibility for it.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.826
Do you want to
just go to this place?

44:23.286 --> 44:24.578
Sure.

44:33.546 --> 44:35.130
I feel like you just
got really upset, though.

44:35.214 --> 44:36.614
And I honestly was
just teasing you.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.258
Okay. I'll be back in a second.

44:46.267 --> 44:49.019
It's okay if you're feeling
sensitive and I'll drop it.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.438
The only reason
I want to talk about it

44:55.610 --> 44:59.029
I think it's just going
home after four years.

44:59.113 --> 45:01.281
It's just bringing
up some weird shit.

45:02.909 --> 45:04.451
What kind of weird shit?

45:05.244 --> 45:06.286
I don't know.

45:06.621 --> 45:08.997
Just weird shit, really.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.125
Oh, my God!

45:13.461 --> 45:14.503
Oh, hey!

45:14.587 --> 45:15.754
- Sorry!
- Sorry about that.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.547
Sorry. Very sorry.

45:17.632 --> 45:18.840
Our bad. Sorry.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.135
Oh, my God!

45:24.680 --> 45:25.806
Get away from the door!

45:25.890 --> 45:27.682
That was a real
life lemon party.

45:27.767 --> 45:32.270
That was grannies and
grampies fooling around!

45:33.481 --> 45:34.981
What you buying, baby?

45:35.691 --> 45:38.026
I was just checking
my Facebook page.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.613
I don't know why. You ain't single
and you've got three friends.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.240
What the fuck you be
checking on Facebook?

45:43.324 --> 45:45.492
What are you
checking on Facebook?

45:45.743 --> 45:48.245
Maybe Allen put some
new photos of himself

45:48.329 --> 45:50.205
naked in front of the mirror.
I have to stay abreast.

45:50.289 --> 45:51.915
You don't want to miss that.

45:58.548 --> 46:00.257
Get the fuck out of here.

46:00.341 --> 46:01.675
What?

46:03.302 --> 46:04.719
- Get your shit. We've got to go.
- Where are you going?

46:04.804 --> 46:06.930
We got to go. Come on.
Get your shit. We got to go.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.683
That's what happens. I talked
to him 10 minutes ago!

46:09.767 --> 46:12.561
No. He knows where he is.
All right? I'll see you soon.

46:12.687 --> 46:14.312
Babe? You gonna
take care of the dogs?-

46:14.397 --> 46:15.772
Did you put the alarm on?

46:15.857 --> 46:16.940
Yes.

46:22.363 --> 46:23.947
Hey, honey?
What was Gil screaming

46:24.031 --> 46:25.949
when you were
walking towards the car?

46:26.033 --> 46:28.326
He sounded like he
was repeating something.

46:28.703 --> 46:30.871
I don't know what the fuck
he was saying. He's nuts.

46:31.164 --> 46:33.457
Well, obviously you heard
what he was saying.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.375
He kept repeating it
over and over again.

46:35.710 --> 46:37.586
He was just talking shit.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.087
But what was it?

46:43.426 --> 46:44.885
Charlie?

46:46.053 --> 46:47.721
What was he saying?

46:48.556 --> 46:49.806
He was saying "Yul Perrkins."

46:49.891 --> 46:51.641
He was saying "Yul Perrkins"
over and over again

46:51.726 --> 46:54.007
so that you would hear and then
we would be in this fight.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.103
So he won.

46:55.188 --> 46:58.648
We're not fighting. What are you...
Who's Yul Perrkins?

47:00.109 --> 47:03.236
That's my name. That's my real name.
Yul Perrkins.

47:04.197 --> 47:06.865
Perrkins. Yul Perrkins
is my real name.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.869
Why on earth would
we fight about that?

47:10.953 --> 47:13.330
I don't know. I just feel like
this is gonna be a fight.

47:13.414 --> 47:15.457
Like, why wouldn't I have
told you my name before?

47:15.541 --> 47:17.250
Or that comment you
made about my car.

47:17.335 --> 47:19.461
Or the old me.
I just, you know...

47:19.921 --> 47:22.547
I want everything to be exactly
how it's been since we've met.

47:22.632 --> 47:25.467
I don't want to have to go all
the way back into my background

47:25.551 --> 47:27.052
just because
we're going to L.A.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.638
Can you calm down? Come here.
Come here for a second.

47:30.389 --> 47:32.224
Please come sit
on the bed with me.

47:41.359 --> 47:46.905
I think Yul Perrkins
is a very cute name.

47:47.490 --> 47:50.158
I think it sounds like
a Sesame Street character.

47:50.618 --> 47:51.868
Yeah?

47:51.953 --> 47:55.622
So did all the kids on the playground.
It was not very cute.

47:56.457 --> 47:59.292
My dad loves Yul Brynner.
He thinks he's a badass.

47:59.377 --> 48:02.379
But no one in my generation's
ever heard of him.

48:05.299 --> 48:06.716
Can I ask you
one more question?

48:06.801 --> 48:08.281
And you promise
you'll tell the truth?

48:08.469 --> 48:09.761
Yeah.

48:12.807 --> 48:16.309
Did they assign you the name Charlie
Bronson or did you get to pick it?

48:17.645 --> 48:18.979
I picked it.

48:21.482 --> 48:24.401
Was it 'cause you
thought it sounded tough

48:24.485 --> 48:26.987
and you were tired of
having a sissy name?

48:28.239 --> 48:29.531
Yeah.

48:31.534 --> 48:34.578
That is the most adorable thing
I've ever heard. Come here.

48:39.166 --> 48:41.835
And you loved
Charles Bronson movies?

48:44.463 --> 48:48.091
I actually named myself after
that famous English prisoner

48:48.175 --> 48:51.970
who named himself after
the actor Charles Bronson.

48:52.680 --> 48:56.433
And I found him
intriguing, I guess.

48:56.517 --> 48:57.934
That's weird.

48:58.394 --> 49:01.646
To find someone
like that intriguing.

49:02.189 --> 49:03.189
It's weird.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.941
Well, look, I don't know...

49:05.234 --> 49:07.360
It sounds stupid now that
I'm saying it out loud,

49:07.445 --> 49:09.446
but at the time it seemed...

49:10.781 --> 49:12.449
I didn't know you then, Annie.

49:12.533 --> 49:16.453
So I obviously picked the wrong name.
And I'm sorry that I...

49:16.579 --> 49:18.913
- It's fine. Hey. Hey!
- You can call me whatever you want.

49:18.998 --> 49:23.543
You're not on trial here, okay?
This is all just new to me.

49:24.253 --> 49:26.880
Come back here. Come back.

49:28.549 --> 49:29.549
You want to drop it?

49:30.551 --> 49:32.510
Yeah. I would appreciate that.
Okay.

49:39.894 --> 49:42.020
- 127?
- Are you kidding me?

49:42.104 --> 49:44.939
Might as well tap me on the
shoulder and say, "Fuck you."

50:26.065 --> 50:27.607
Sir, are you okay?

50:28.609 --> 50:29.769
Have you been in an accident?

50:29.777 --> 50:30.902
What?

50:30.986 --> 50:33.655
No. I'm a U.S. marshal.

50:34.615 --> 50:38.034
Okay. Sir, your vehicle
appears to be totaled.

50:38.119 --> 50:41.037
And I clocked you at 127
miles per hour back there.

50:41.122 --> 50:44.040
I'm a marshal. And I've got
someone in witness protection

50:44.125 --> 50:45.667
who needs my protection.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.210
I totally understand, sir.

50:47.294 --> 50:49.713
Is there any way you
could stay below 100?

50:49.797 --> 50:52.382
I'm very worried about this car
getting up into triple digits.

50:53.926 --> 50:56.594
I suppose I could try
to keep it in the high 90s.

50:56.679 --> 50:58.763
Thank you. 'Cause just
like it's your job

50:58.848 --> 51:01.516
to be protecting whoever
you may be protecting...

51:01.600 --> 51:03.351
What? Hold on a second.

51:03.436 --> 51:04.477
I'll be right back, sir.

51:04.562 --> 51:05.562
I need to talk to you.

51:06.355 --> 51:09.232
What?

51:09.316 --> 51:12.235
Okay. I wasn't snooping.
But your phone did vibrate

51:12.319 --> 51:14.154
and so I checked it out and...

51:14.655 --> 51:16.197
That's your Pouncer app, right?

51:16.282 --> 51:17.282
Yeah.

51:17.366 --> 51:19.451
Okay. So that dot popped
up like two seconds ago.

51:19.535 --> 51:23.037
So, there's got to be another gay
guy within, what, 100 feet of here?

51:23.497 --> 51:24.539
Yeah.

51:24.832 --> 51:27.041
I mean, it must be him.

51:28.002 --> 51:33.089
Although I don't think
he's gay. He's like 50.

51:34.675 --> 51:36.259
There's 50-year-old
gay people, Angelia.

51:36.343 --> 51:37.927
We don't grow out of being gay.

51:38.012 --> 51:40.722
Oh, no. I didn't... That's
not what I meant. I just...

51:40.806 --> 51:42.640
I just think you
should ask him out.

51:43.017 --> 51:44.601
What do you mean...
Because he's gay

51:44.685 --> 51:45.935
and I'm gay I should
just ask him out?

51:46.020 --> 51:47.101
What are you talking about?

51:47.104 --> 51:49.147
Are you instantly attracted to
every straight person you meet?

51:49.231 --> 51:50.273
No.

51:50.357 --> 51:51.357
Come on.

51:56.155 --> 51:57.614
I'm actually gonna let you go.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.657
But I do need to see your phone
for a second please, sir.

51:59.742 --> 52:00.784
Why?

52:00.868 --> 52:03.578
A small request after
you were driving that fast.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.330
Can I see your
phone please, sir?

52:06.040 --> 52:07.874
Thank you very much.

52:09.418 --> 52:12.003
Yeah. There we go.
That's what I thought.

52:12.087 --> 52:13.463
Hi.

52:13.547 --> 52:14.714
What are you doing?

52:15.007 --> 52:17.801
I'm programming my name
and number in here.

52:18.344 --> 52:20.553
Just in case you
ever need "backup."

52:21.013 --> 52:22.055
What are you...

52:22.139 --> 52:23.473
Pouncer.

52:23.557 --> 52:25.225
I didn't know what...

52:25.726 --> 52:27.393
Oh, you had no idea
what it was?

52:27.478 --> 52:29.813
It's okay. Don't be embarrassed.
I'm a fan of Pouncer.

52:29.897 --> 52:31.898
I Pounce.
You Pounce too, I guess.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.192
So, you should be
very flattered,

52:34.276 --> 52:36.486
'cause I'm an eight
and you're a five, so...

52:36.821 --> 52:38.238
You have a safe night.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.406
Right.

52:46.455 --> 52:49.415
Okay. Do you need to call me back
after you've collected yourself?

52:49.500 --> 52:50.917
No, no, no. I'm good.

52:51.418 --> 52:53.670
So I stopped off at
San Andreas and Jackson.

52:53.754 --> 52:55.046
They were nowhere to be found.

52:55.130 --> 52:57.340
I don't think they could
have got as far as Planada.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.425
So my guess is Mariposa.

52:59.510 --> 53:02.053
We'll take a peek in Planada
on our way up to Mariposa.

53:02.137 --> 53:04.806
Oh, great! Great.
Now, about the girl, Annie,

53:04.890 --> 53:07.100
who's my girlfriend
and a victim in all this.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.810
I want assurances...

53:09.103 --> 53:10.478
Hello?

53:10.563 --> 53:11.855
Did that drop or did he just...

53:17.278 --> 53:18.862
Hey, buddy, look.
They have shower caps.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.114
Oh, yeah? Your favorite.

53:21.532 --> 53:22.615
Yep.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.576
I'm gonna go get some
coffee for us, okay?

53:24.660 --> 53:25.702
Okay.

53:25.786 --> 53:27.412
I'll be ready to go in 10.

53:27.746 --> 53:28.705
Have a good shower.

53:28.789 --> 53:30.039
Thank you.

54:16.712 --> 54:18.171
Come on!

54:40.361 --> 54:42.111
Are you...

54:48.410 --> 54:51.329
Fuck!

54:54.708 --> 54:57.835
That fucking hillbilly from the gas
station stole my engine last night!

54:57.920 --> 54:58.962
What?

54:59.046 --> 55:01.339
From the Lincoln! I just
went out there to start it.

55:01.423 --> 55:02.924
There's no engine inside.

55:03.342 --> 55:04.884
How do you steal an engine?

55:04.969 --> 55:07.637
Grind the motor mounts out and
pull it out with a cherry picker.

55:07.721 --> 55:08.972
It probably took
him 20 minutes.

55:09.056 --> 55:10.139
Fuck!

55:10.224 --> 55:11.724
Is there anything I can do?

55:12.559 --> 55:13.810
No. Just finish your shower.

55:13.894 --> 55:14.978
I'm gonna go to the lobby

55:15.062 --> 55:16.521
and see if they know
someone with a tow truck.

55:16.605 --> 55:19.565
Okay.
That was a $12,000 engine.

55:20.567 --> 55:23.319
Sorry your engine
was stolen, sweetie!

55:28.283 --> 55:29.367
Where is she?

55:29.910 --> 55:31.031
What the fuck are you doing?

55:31.078 --> 55:32.120
Where is she, man?

55:32.204 --> 55:33.830
You just fucking broke my nose!

55:33.914 --> 55:36.749
I don't care! I swear to God
if you already killed her...

55:38.085 --> 55:40.878
I'm not a fucking killer, man!
What's wrong with you?

55:40.963 --> 55:44.632
You were involved in a homicide!
I am not leaving without her.

55:44.717 --> 55:46.157
Get that fucking
club out of my face!

55:46.176 --> 55:47.343
Don't talk to me like that!

55:47.428 --> 55:50.138
Listen, man! She is fine!
Do you want to see her?

55:50.431 --> 55:51.597
Yes!

55:52.016 --> 55:54.058
Lower that shit and
I'll show her to you!

55:54.143 --> 55:55.351
All right! Open the door!

55:55.436 --> 55:56.978
What the fuck
are you thinking, man?

55:57.479 --> 55:59.397
Hitting me in the nose
with a golf club?

55:59.481 --> 56:00.815
I didn't think it
would hurt that bad!

56:00.899 --> 56:02.066
Jesus Christ!

56:02.151 --> 56:03.401
Just open the door, man!

56:03.485 --> 56:07.113
I've been through some shit. I've
never seen a bitch move like that.

56:07.614 --> 56:09.574
Well, if you wouldn't
be such an asshole!

56:10.117 --> 56:12.994
You know what pisses me off the most about
you hitting me with this fucking...

56:13.078 --> 56:14.787
No! I don't really
give a shit either.

56:20.169 --> 56:23.129
It's that you made me
break my promise to Annie.

56:26.508 --> 56:28.634
That was a shitty
thing to do, Gil!

56:30.012 --> 56:32.638
That was really
fucking selfish of you.

56:35.142 --> 56:36.893
Fucking selfish prick.

57:08.634 --> 57:10.259
Oh, fuck! Fuck...

57:36.745 --> 57:37.870
Honey!

57:37.955 --> 57:39.497
I'm sorry!
Sorry, sorry, sorry! Honey?

57:39.581 --> 57:40.915
We have got to go right now.

57:40.999 --> 57:42.542
I will tell you
about it in the car, okay?

57:42.626 --> 57:44.460
What car? I thought
you said the car was...

57:44.545 --> 57:47.171
Baby, this is life or death. I need you
to get out of the shower this second.

57:47.256 --> 57:48.381
- Okay? Let's go.
- Okay.

57:56.056 --> 57:58.850
I don't understand. What happened to your face?
Why are you bleeding?

57:58.934 --> 58:00.852
Baby, will you please just
get dressed and pack, okay?

58:00.978 --> 58:03.219
- Yes.
- The people I testified against are in the lobby.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.522
We got to get out
of here right now.

58:04.606 --> 58:05.648
Should I call the police?

58:05.732 --> 58:06.774
There's no time for that.

58:06.942 --> 58:08.776
Why are you bleeding?
Did they hit you?

58:08.861 --> 58:10.153
Baby, just faster, okay?

58:10.237 --> 58:11.988
I'm going as fast as I can!

58:12.072 --> 58:14.615
They are right out there.
Okay, go baby! Go, go, go!

58:14.700 --> 58:15.867
Okay, I'm going! I'm going!

58:21.206 --> 58:22.415
Okay.

58:22.875 --> 58:24.792
I'll grab Yul.
You got the girl?

58:24.877 --> 58:25.877
Yeah, I've got her.

58:25.961 --> 58:28.361
You want me to take the gun since
you're focused on the door?

58:28.463 --> 58:29.672
I think I can manage both.

58:29.756 --> 58:30.756
Okay. All right.

58:36.221 --> 58:37.680
All right.
We're gonna go on three.

58:38.390 --> 58:39.432
One.

58:39.516 --> 58:40.558
You all right?

58:40.642 --> 58:41.726
Yep. Here we go.

58:41.810 --> 58:43.519
One. Two.

58:43.937 --> 58:45.271
Three.

58:45.355 --> 58:46.772
Where the fuck is Yul?

58:49.276 --> 58:50.902
Hey! What are you
looking at, bro?

58:50.986 --> 58:52.570
- Is Yul here?
- Fuck!

58:52.946 --> 58:55.865
Come on! They're seniors. It's
the wrong room. Come on. Go!

58:55.949 --> 58:58.367
Fucking embarrassing, man!
I know.

58:58.452 --> 58:59.744
That shit was disgusting!

59:03.665 --> 59:05.374
- You got everything you need?
- Yes.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.300
We're good. We're good,
we're good, we're good.

59:08.212 --> 59:09.378
Damn it!

59:09.630 --> 59:11.839
Can you grab that?
Yeah, honey...

59:13.342 --> 59:15.426
Okay. Your purse.

59:15.510 --> 59:17.345
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

59:22.017 --> 59:23.267
What is that?

59:23.352 --> 59:24.936
It's a remote keyless entry.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.145
For which car?

59:26.230 --> 59:27.521
It's kind of a universal one.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.440
Where did you get that?

59:29.524 --> 59:32.568
I just made it. Mama, will you
just throw your stuff in the car?

59:32.653 --> 59:34.403
Let's go. Go, go,
go, go, go. Faster!

59:35.489 --> 59:38.241
Wait a second. I'm not just going
to get into someone else's car.

59:38.325 --> 59:39.659
Sweetie, it's not the time!

59:42.663 --> 59:43.788
Hey!

59:50.671 --> 59:51.963
Hurry up! Let's go!

01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:15.569
Did you just steal this car?

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.864
Yes, I did. But only because
I absolutely had to.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.783
How did you steal it?

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.077
If you lose your keyless entry
and go to the dealership

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.288
they use the VIN number to get
a new code in their program.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.123
And I got a new code
and I programmed this one.

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:28.749
But how?
How did you get the code?

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:33.344
I have passwords for
the different dealerships.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.381
Why do you have
those passwords?

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:36.966
Charlie?

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.634
Look. If we have
this conversation

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:39.927
and I'm completely
honest with you,

01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:41.637
I'm afraid you're not gonna
want to be with me anymore.

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:44.515
Okay, well, if we don't have this
conversation, I can't be with you.

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:46.726
I can't be with someone
that I don't trust.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.394
So you're just going
to have to risk it.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.071
Asshole!

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:02.325
You know I witnessed a bank
robbery that went really wrong.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.451
Yeah.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.995
What I left out is that
I was kind of involved.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.998
Not in the violence part, but
in the getaway driving part.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.291
I'm sorry I didn't
say that to you,

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:11.584
but when I got into
witness protection

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:12.835
I looked at it
as a new beginning.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.378
And I knew I wasn't going
to be that guy anymore...

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:16.130
You're a bank robber?

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:17.798
Charlie?

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:20.801
No. I didn't actually
rob any of the banks.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:22.345
Alex and Allen did the robbing

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:25.056
and I did the driving them to
and from the bank robbing.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.725
Banks? Plural?

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.370
How many times did
you do that, Charlie?

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.020
I don't know. A few.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:32.313
You don't know?

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:33.522
Maybe 12 or 13.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.066
"Maybe"? Maybe a dozen?

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.692
Maybe a baker's dozen?
You're not sure?

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:38.027
No. It was 13.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.192
You're sure that is was 13?

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:41.989
Yes, it was absolutely 13. This is
why I didn't tell you about this.

01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:43.699
Because I knew you were
going to react this way.

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:46.452
Who wouldn't react this way,
Charlie? A sociopath?

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:49.080
Look, I have a terrible past.
I'm sorry about that.

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.998
But it has
nothing to do with us.

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:53.209
How'd you do it?
How'd you get off, Charlie?

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:55.711
You testified against your
friends to save your own ass?

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:57.796
They were gonna charge Neve
with accessory to murder

01:01:57.798 --> 01:01:59.298
because she cased the job.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:02.843
So either I turned on Alex and
Allen, who did the shooting,

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.845
or Neve went to prison
for the rest of her life.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.097
Who is Neve?

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:08.349
The black girl
in the station wagon.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:10.101
Why aren't they
in prison, Charlie?

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.978
They implied I wasn't a credible
witness because I was...

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.856
You know, engaged to Neve.

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:21.529
You were engaged to a woman
who plans bank robberies?

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.656
Who are you?

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:25.324
Listen. Sweetie. Please?

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.492
Don't.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.372
Pull the car over. I think
I'm going to throw up.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.333
I can't pull over right now, or
Alex is gonna shoot both of us.

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:37.795
Then fucking lose them, Charlie!
So you can let me out!

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.810
Hey, buddy!
It's me from last night!

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.229
Yeah! The minivan!
I could really use your help.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:56.564
I'm at some abandoned airfield.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:23.067
I cannot believe this is
a fucking station wagon!

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:24.360
This shit is so fast!

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:34.245
We might not make this!

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.416
Watch out for Gil!

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:55.975
Fucking shit!

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:57.476
Fuck!

01:04:58.436 --> 01:04:59.937
Fuck!

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:04.316
Damn it! Pick up already.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:06.652
Debby. It's not a good time.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:07.903
Am I fucking up your massage?

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:09.280
'Cause you're fucking up mine!

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:10.573
What is it?

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.700
I got a call from UC. Sandy's
got some emergency tomorrow.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.464
So you have to be
there by 4:00 p.m. today.

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:16.579
That might be impossible.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:19.415
Are you kidding me? I could leave
Milton now and be there by 4:00.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.083
Deb, I don't think
you understand!

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.502
Annie, I am in the middle of something.
Just get there!

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:27.339
Don't be a pussy.

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:32.052
Please pull over and
find a place to let me out.

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:35.097
Annie? I want to talk
about this. Okay?

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:38.142
Just let me drive you to L.A. and
we can talk it out on the way.

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:40.978
You are engaged!
You're a criminal!

01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:44.382
If you don't pull over, I'm jumping out.
And I'm not kidding!

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:45.733
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:57.828
Hold on a second, okay?

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:01.040
Annie! Hey!
Where are you going?

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:05.169
You're going to walk aimlessly
through an orange grove?

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:06.503
I did not lie to you!

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.589
Omitting is lying, Charlie!

01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:12.259
What if I had sex with a co-worker
and I didn't tell you that?

01:06:12.344 --> 01:06:14.219
You wouldn't
think that was a lie?

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:15.971
No! That would be a lie!

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:17.473
Because we're in a relationship

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.892
and we owe each other
those kind of details.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:25.481
Look, whatever you're mad about
happened before we ever met, okay?

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:28.484
Look! I have not violated
your trust once since we met.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:31.487
Except for completely
lying about who you are.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.698
Look, you may have had three-ways
with dudes or smoked cocaine!

01:06:34.783 --> 01:06:35.866
I don't know!

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.160
But if you had, just because you
didn't disclose that to me,

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.120
doesn't mean you're a liar!

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:42.456
I don't care what
you did before we met.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.333
All I care about
is who you are now!

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.627
Really?
So if I was a pedophile,

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:50.005
if I had raped children,
you wouldn't care about that?

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:52.424
If I had been a member of
the Ku Klux Klan? No biggie?

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:53.759
That wouldn't bother you?

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:58.263
You wouldn't feel like a complete idiot
for having fallen in love with me?

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.601
Buddy, I...

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.979
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:08.649
I was ashamed.
And I was embarrassed.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:12.417
And I thought we would just live in
Milton for the rest of our lives

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.654
and be happy and have babies.

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:15.781
And I would be Charlie.
And that would be that.

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.618
What if I did tell you?
Be honest.

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:21.453
Would you have
fallen in love with me?

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:24.873
I don't know!

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:27.835
And I'm never gonna know,

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:30.129
because you took that
decision away from me.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.717
But yes, Charlie! I find it
very difficult to believe

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.719
that someone who
justified robbing 13 banks

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.595
would ever not be
that type of person.

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:41.682
It's not exactly the high
profile background you look for

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:44.059
when you're choosing
someone to have a baby with.

01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:47.980
You know, if I was an ex-drug
addict or an ex-alcoholic,

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.441
I guarantee you would be
able to look past that.

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:51.567
That's not the point.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.444
The bottom line is
in any relationship

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:55.696
you can either wallow
in the person's past,

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.865
or you can look at the person
that's right in front of you

01:07:57.949 --> 01:08:00.576
and choose to move forward.
But you can't do both.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.664
I agree.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.833
Then move forward with me.

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:15.090
But the person in
front of me lied to me.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.094
Whether you want to call
it that or not, Charlie.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.185
I need to get to L.A.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.022
And I'm gonna do
that without you.

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:34.484
How?

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:07.184
Hey.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.437
Are you okay?

01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:12.564
Yeah. I'm fine. Can you...

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:15.108
Can you drive me the rest
of the way to L.A., please?

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:16.318
Of course.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:19.196
Or would you rather go back to
our house and digest all this?

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:22.073
No, Gil. I just
want to get to L.A.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.158
I can do that.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.703
Why don't you hop in and I'll
gather all your belongings?

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.996
Okay.

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:34.795
Hey, asshole. Do not even think
about tailing us. I'm serious.

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.680
Or what? You're gonna
stab me with that knife?

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.131
I could, if you charged me.

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:39.883
Yeah? Okay. I'm terrified.

01:09:39.968 --> 01:09:41.885
Yeah, well,
you're the aggressor.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:44.888
Listen. I still think
you're a fucking turd.

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:47.057
But I'm sorry
that I clocked you

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.643
and I appreciate you
taking Annie to L.A.

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:51.603
You're welcome.

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:54.523
Oh, and we know who got the
best of who in that scuffle.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.608
So, if you forgot,

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.236
just ask your previous shirt.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:01.113
I will.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:10.080
You got your seatbelt on?

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:14.751
He's not answering.

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:17.004
Oh, my God! Pounce him!

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:18.248
What do you mean "Pounce him"?

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.097
Use your app. Your Pouncer app.
And Pounce him.

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.801
Oh, my God!
You're brilliant. Okay.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:25.762
I see him! He's on here! Okay...

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.097
Go straight.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.392
He's right there. He's right there.
He's right there.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:31.518
Bingo.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:33.478
Oh, my God.

01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:46.158
What the hell happened?

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:48.619
Was he executed?

01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:50.120
I don't know.

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:53.916
Randy?

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.131
I hit my head.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:06.261
Let's go!

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:13.101
You okay?

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:16.688
You want to pull over
and have a warm meal, or...

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:18.690
Or would you rather process?

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:22.527
Okay.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:24.655
You process.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:26.198
Gil?

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:35.999
You okay?

01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:37.501
Yeah.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:40.963
Hey!

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.381
Don't even think about it!

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.883
Let me go!

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:46.343
Gil!

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.722
Gil! What the fuck?

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:06.488
- Annie?
- Yul?

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:08.782
How you doing, buddy?

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:10.742
Where are you right now?
Where's Annie?

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.077
We're at the Stoneside Diner

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.538
having some French fries and onion rings.
Why don't you come down?

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:16.373
Don't be a fucking
asshole, Alex.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:17.791
She has nothing to do with us.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:21.294
I'd hurry up if I were you. Neve's
mad-dogging the hell out of her.

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.030
You look really good, Yul.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:49.531
Yeah.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:53.118
You used to look older than Alex, but
now you look younger. It's crazy.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:55.078
He looks good.
Doesn't he, babe?

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.622
I don't know. Who gives a shit?

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.291
Really, baby?

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:03.295
Yeah, well, I would have
asked for your permission,

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.213
but you kind of fell
off the map, didn't you?

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:06.631
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, man.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:07.837
I'm sure you fucking hate me.

01:13:07.842 --> 01:13:09.176
But I don't think I really
had a choice, did I?

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.428
Yeah, I do fucking hate you.
You betrayed me.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.931
Okay? We were best friends
and you testified against me.

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:20.520
You know what? Fuck you.

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:23.732
You fucking betrayed me.
You fucking shot a dude, man!

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:25.137
You put us all in
this shitty mess

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:27.694
where I got to pick between my
fiancee and my best friend!

01:13:27.779 --> 01:13:29.696
That's your fucking fault!
So fuck you!

01:13:29.781 --> 01:13:31.406
I'm sorry.
You were inside the bank?

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:33.283
- No.
- I forgot about that!

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.487
You were inside the bank and
you saw the security guard

01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:36.870
pointing a fucking
gun at Allen.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:38.455
Oh, no! No, you weren't!

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:42.167
You were in the fucking car trying to
change the fucking oldies station!

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:46.129
I'm sure the $6 an hour fucking
retard was gonna shoot Allen.

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:47.589
- Are you kidding me?
- He would have shot me!

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:49.713
- You don't fucking know!
- Shut the fuck up, Allen!

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:51.009
- You don't get to do that.
- What do you want?

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:52.135
You don't get
to do that anymore.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:53.386
- You're not in this fucking circle.
- Sorry, Allen.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:54.679
- What do you want?
- I want money.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:55.972
That's it, bro. I don't
want anything else.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:57.737
You got it. Let's go
to my dad's right now.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.047
Let her out of the car.
Let's go.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.602
No. She's gonna
come with. Let's go.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:01.978
Stay in the car.
Hold on a second, dude.

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:03.772
You're gonna fucking turn
this into kidnapping?

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:04.898
I'll give you the money.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.108
Let's go right now.
Let's just go.

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:08.777
Hey, no. I'm being serious.
Alex? Please listen to me.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:09.945
Seriously, dude?

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:13.115
You're gonna risk going to prison
when I'm cooperating? I don't get it.

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.283
'Cause you
owe me, motherfucker!

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.493
Do you understand?
It's that simple.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:19.162
I want you to feel the fucking
uncomfortable situation I was in.

01:14:19.247 --> 01:14:21.289
You got off!
What are you talking about?

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:22.457
I was in jail for eight months!

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:24.876
Oh, my God? Eight months!
Are you fucking crazy?

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.170
I've been in Siberia
for four years!

01:14:27.255 --> 01:14:29.339
The fucking
arrogance of you, man!

01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:30.632
You don't understand
what you're talking about.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:33.009
I don't understand? What? You fucking
didn't like the gym equipment?

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:34.427
There wasn't enough
time for you to read?

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:35.804
I got butt-fucked.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:43.478
I got fucked in the
butt because of you.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.732
Yeah.

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:51.820
That's horrible. I did not
realize that happened in jail.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:53.488
I thought that
was a prison thing.

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:54.990
Yeah, well...

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:58.743
I guess it's not
exclusive to prisons.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.336
Well, I mean, you've never
been, like, a homophobe.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:11.173
It seems like something
you probably worked through.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:12.716
You're a strong dude.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.384
I don't think homophobia
has anything to do with it.

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:16.052
The guy was disgusting.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.056
If I was gay I would still
want to come after you.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.266
I'm really sorry.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.268
I'm really, really sorry.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.020
Was it a black guy?

01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:28.023
No, it wasn't a black guy.

01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:30.328
That's a pretty fucking
racist thing to say.

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.401
Why would you assume
it's a black guy?

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:32.986
- You think that's racist?
- Yeah.

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:35.655
I think that's
the opposite of racist.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.220
I don't think it would make a black
guy gay to fuck a white dude

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.826
because we're such
pussies compared to them.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.786
What the fuck are you even
talking about right now?

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.431
I'm saying if I was a black dude I
wouldn't feel the least bit gay

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:45.540
about fucking a white guy.

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.826
I would think a white guy is
just like masculine chicks.

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:49.920
Like, Ellen. She's masculine,

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:51.880
but I would totally fuck
her if I were single.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:53.798
I wasn't fucked by a black guy.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:55.550
Okay?

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:56.968
- Can we just go?
- Okay.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:02.891
Was it a Mexican guy?

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:04.142
No.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:17.155
Oh, man.

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:21.243
Was it one of those white guys?
Those fucking Nazis?

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.577
Because if so, man.
I am so fucking sorry.

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.342
No! It was not
a fucking white guy, either.

01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:27.415
Charlie? It doesn't matter
who violated him. Okay?

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.251
It could have been
any number of people.

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:30.794
It doesn't matter
their race, okay?

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:32.420
It could have been Latino.
It could have been Tongan.

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.545
- It could have been a Persian...
- It was Filipino!

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:38.176
I was butt-fucked by
a Filipino dude, okay?

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:40.637
Does that fucking
solve your dilemma

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:43.139
of what part of the world
my ass traveled to?

01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:44.266
Well...

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:48.186
I mean, I don't think...
That's not so bad.

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:51.690
I mean, just like all black
dudes think of us as women,

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:56.278
I think of all Asians as women, you know?
Even the men.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:59.614
I feel like you basically
hooked up with an Asian lady.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:02.421
- Charlie, just...
- No, I didn't hook up with anybody, bro. I was raped.

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:03.533
Okay, listen, I don't...

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:04.577
Fucking hooked up?

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:05.704
I'm just trying to help.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.206
I feel partly responsible for
this and I'm really sorry.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.125
Well that's a weird angle, bro.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.219
Fucking back up, Randy!

01:17:27.435 --> 01:17:29.144
Gil, what the fuck
are you doing out here?

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:31.271
They have Annie.
Alex Dmitri took her.

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.023
Get in the van. Ride with him.

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:35.025
Let's go!

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.414
Hey...

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:59.090
Hey, you remember my dad lives at
1805 Burns in Spicewood, right?

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:00.175
I don't remember a place.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:01.718
I've been to 200 times, no.

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:04.346
1805 Spicewood
in Burns, California.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.764
Write that down.
Write that down.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:29.454
Look at this guy. Ringing the
doorbell to his own house.

01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:33.333
What's wrong?

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:37.295
I have not talked to my dad
since I got arrested, so...

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:39.255
Yeah, but that's
not your fault.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.216
He knows you can't
contact your family.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:43.301
No. You can.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.846
Charlie, you told me that you
couldn't contact your family.

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:49.011
I did not tell you that.
You might have assumed that.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.934
But I never said that.
Okay, fine. Forget it.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.089
Why haven't you
talked to your dad?

01:18:56.107 --> 01:18:57.649
I don't know...

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:02.153
Shame? Fucking
demoralizing shame?

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:11.413
That's been four years coming.

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:13.456
And you deserve
more than just that.

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:14.749
I know.

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:17.836
Yeah, I don't know what
pisses me off the most, Yul.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.088
The fact that you got
involved in all that shit,

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:23.174
or that you ran off like a
coward when everything blew up.

01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.469
I didn't raise that person.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.513
That's not my son.

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:33.226
And you used the Lincoln.

01:19:33.853 --> 01:19:35.437
Our project car.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:37.355
Makes me sick!

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:39.566
Yeah. Me too.

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:44.654
Now, why are you
all together again?

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:46.322
Not by choice.

01:19:46.407 --> 01:19:48.825
I buried something in
the pasture that Alex wants.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:50.785
Hey, Mr. Perrkins. How are you?
Good to see you.

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:51.870
Mr. Perrkins.

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:53.204
Now, who's this one?

01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:58.501
This is Annie. She is my,
or was, my girlfriend.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:00.879
Prior to all
this being revealed.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.089
Hi. Nice to meet you, sir.

01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:07.719
Clint Perrkins.

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:13.057
Good. Good. Good. This feels right.
This feels right.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:14.517
Want to go to the pasture?

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:16.936
Good to see you.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.355
You know I'm going to shoot
you in the back of the head

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.732
if you don't find this money?
You know that?

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.317
What are you going to
do with this money, Alex?

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:24.444
They know the serial numbers
on half these bills.

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.321
I don't think they're gonna be
caring about serial numbers

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:27.572
in Iraq, bro.

01:20:28.908 --> 01:20:30.158
Get the fuck out of here.

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:31.576
You're going to buy dinar?

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:33.328
How the fuck do
you know about dinar?

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:35.371
If you buy $100,000
worth of dinar

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.582
and it goes to the value of the
Kuwait dollar, you're looking at

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:38.917
- $300,000,000.
- $300,000,000.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:41.294
Heaven forbid either of you
ever worked for something.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:43.738
Hey, Clint? Why don't you think
of this gun as a microphone?

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:46.257
When it's not in your hand
you shut the fuck up. Okay?

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:51.429
It's none of my business,
but just so you know,

01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:53.264
the Charlie that...

01:20:53.933 --> 01:20:57.352
Yul, that I've known
for the past year

01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:00.104
I think is the one that
you were trying to raise.

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:03.191
He's actually
a pretty good boy.

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:04.734
Yeah.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.152
Hey, give me that shovel!

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.738
Boy, you look like
a monkey fucking a football.

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:10.031
Oh, I got it, Pops. Thanks.

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:11.366
Allen. Let him do it.

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:13.451
That is bullshit, though.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.162
Hey...

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.874
I'm sorry
I disappeared like that.

01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:23.795
I couldn't handle letting you
down on top of everything else.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.964
It was just too much for me.
And it was

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.008
cowardly. And I'm sorry.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.429
I'm racing Class 1 now.

01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:35.098
Get out of here. Class 1?

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:38.810
Yep. I bought a Tatum,
700 horse.

01:21:38.978 --> 01:21:40.478
You should drive it.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.314
Motherfucker will go over
or through anything.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:45.483
It's a...

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:01.124
Good luck with the dinar.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.667
Oh, man.

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.252
It's gonna be huge, Yul.

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:05.336
And you could have shared on it

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.422
if you weren't such a shitty
motherfucking friend.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:08.590
All right. Let's go.

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:09.914
- Don't touch me!
- What, bitch?

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:10.967
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.930
You want to see me act like
a fucking degenerate, bitch?

01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:19.017
Get off her! Alex, man, you've
got the fucking money! Just go!

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:20.184
Annie's coming with us.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:21.811
When the deal is made
and the cops aren't called

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:23.104
then she can do whatever
the fuck she wants.

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:25.648
No one's calling the cops.
Just please, take the money.

01:22:25.733 --> 01:22:27.233
I'm not fucking
asking you a question.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.089
Go! Go, baby, get him!

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:51.341
Hey!

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.636
Hey!

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:00.475
Hey!

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:02.685
Yul!

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:11.277
In here? Is this it?

01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:14.197
No, no! That's not a Tatum!

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:16.074
What a bone grow.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.283
Come on! Let's go!

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:21.788
You open that door!

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:22.914
Seatbelts! Seatbelts!

01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:27.377
Turn it on!

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:28.628
Okay.

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:29.921
Jesus! Look at all this shit!

01:23:35.094 --> 01:23:36.761
Start this ridiculous vehicle!

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.221
Okay! I'm trying! I'm trying!

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:40.014
You're gonna
catch a fucking stray!

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:41.974
Power! I've got power!

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:50.191
Come on, motherfucker!

01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:56.155
Go!

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:19.637
What the fuck just happened?

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.770
What are you doing?

01:24:27.855 --> 01:24:29.814
I can't leave my
dad in that field.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.498
Looks like he's
got it under control!

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:48.666
Yeah.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.282
Come on, motherfucker!

01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:45.264
Give me your gun!

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:04.325
Get out of the car!
Lady! Grab some dirt!

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:05.993
Get your fucking hands up!

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:09.539
I got him!
I shot him! He's shot!

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:11.999
He's shot. He's shot!
He's shot, look!

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:18.714
I don't think they're
following us anymore!

01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:21.384
I can't see a goddamn thing.
Are you sure?

01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:22.510
Yes.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:35.690
Okay, you know what? It's 2:30.

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:37.692
So I think we're just
gonna have to chance it.

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:38.901
What do you mean?

01:26:38.986 --> 01:26:41.529
Well, I mean, we've got to get on
the freeway to get to UC from here.

01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:43.364
And this thing isn't
exactly highway legal.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:45.116
So I think we should...

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.034
I can call a cab.

01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:49.579
But you don't have
time to call a cab.

01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:53.040
Then I'll be late.
Or I won't make it.

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:54.709
But I don't want you
getting arrested over this.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:57.169
I don't care if
I get arrested, okay?

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.506
I promised you that I was gonna
get you to this interview,

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.508
and I'm gonna do that.

01:27:03.302 --> 01:27:04.844
I don't have a job.

01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:06.637
I don't have any friends.

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:08.681
You don't love me anymore.

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:11.809
So my word is really
all I've got going for me.

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:21.819
I don't not love you.

01:27:25.908 --> 01:27:29.076
I'm just terrified
that I don't know you.

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:32.788
I mean, between your fake name
and those were your friends?

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:34.165
Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie.

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:38.544
You know me.

01:27:40.631 --> 01:27:41.881
You do.

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:43.758
You know me more than anyone.

01:27:44.635 --> 01:27:46.636
And I'm gonna be
the exact same person

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.847
you met and fell in love with
for the rest of my life.

01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:59.398
Do you think you can be
the exact same person

01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:02.443
except not say "fag"
when you really mean "lame"?

01:28:04.655 --> 01:28:05.988
Yes.

01:28:09.368 --> 01:28:11.327
And not buy into
get-rich-quick schemes

01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:12.828
that profit from
war-torn countries?

01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:14.246
Okay.

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:18.000
I'll even throw in
stereotyping.

01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:22.922
Okay.

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:27.885
Let's go.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:12.471
I'm gonna go ahead and call horseshit
on the 60 yards, Anderson.

01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:14.181
- Horseshit, my ass.
- Yeah, horseshit.

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:17.393
- That shot was in excess of 60 yards, sir.
- Okay.

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:19.353
And you thought you could
use Big Red's revolver

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:21.564
instead of your own Sig?
This whole thing stinks.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:23.691
I was out of ammunition
from a previous exchange.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:24.817
Yeah, okay.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:26.661
I noticed that you
modified your vehicle too.

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:28.029
It's not really an overhaul.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:30.823
A little bit more of an underhaul, wasn't it?
Did you see that? Good God.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:33.909
It was an extreme pursuit where
I was temporarily airborne.

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:36.662
You want to lay down?
Take a quick sit?

01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:38.414
You've clearly got
professional health problems.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.458
My chest hurts
just looking at you.

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:42.376
You've got total
disregard for equipment.

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.462
But somehow... Somehow...

01:29:44.546 --> 01:29:47.923
you managed to take down
Dmitri without any help.

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:51.052
And that, my friend, that's impressive.
Is it not?

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:52.219
Very.

01:29:52.304 --> 01:29:55.014
Well, I did receive some vital
backup from Officer Rathbinn.

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:56.432
Thank you.

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:57.641
That's you, ginge?

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:58.768
- Yeah.
- Good God.

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:00.269
I'm Terry.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.855
- Hey. Pat Rickman. Great job.
- Thank you.

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:04.857
You know, you're probably gonna
get out of witness protection

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:07.276
for this, big guy?
Maybe even air marshal.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.903
You like that?
You like the sound of that?

01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:11.238
Riding up front, first
class, gun at the ready?

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:12.740
From your mouth
to Grant's ears.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:13.949
I'm gonna whisper
it right in there.

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:15.314
I'm gonna
see him this afternoon.

01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:16.368
I'll make sure he
knows everything.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:17.661
Yeah, we are.

01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:19.705
Hey. We'll even
throw your name in there.

01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:20.831
Really?

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:22.249
Are you interested in
being a U.S. marshal?

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:23.584
100 %. I'm in.

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:24.752
Well, good.

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:30.216
Are you going to borrow
a condom or can we go?

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:31.467
- We can go.
- Okay.

01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:32.593
Nice going.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:34.595
Mike's gonna be back give you
guys a ride a little bit later.

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:36.764
I'm proud of you! Well done!

01:31:05.544 --> 01:31:07.378
Way to go green, asshole.

01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:09.380
It's bio-diesel, friend.

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.882
Okay. You set?

01:31:12.259 --> 01:31:13.968
That was pretty amazing. Right?

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:15.511
Will you acknowledge
how cool that was?

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:16.595
Yeah. It was cool.

01:31:16.721 --> 01:31:18.139
- Are you all right? Are you ready?
- No.

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:20.099
I'm not. I don't have
my teaching certificate.

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:21.304
- Okay.
- I don't have my resume.

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:24.645
I am covered in mud.
I look like a transient.

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:27.648
Put your head back.
Close your eyes.

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:28.732
Okay?

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:30.442
Take a few deep breaths.

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:36.991
This is the only moment
you need to worry about.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.245
You're not late
for anything. We made it.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.080
You're not missing anything.

01:31:43.165 --> 01:31:45.332
You're exactly where
you are supposed to be.

01:31:45.792 --> 01:31:48.252
And you're exactly who
you are supposed to be.

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:50.713
And you are absolutely perfect.

01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:53.382
And if you're up for it

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:57.052
I will spend every moment with
you for the rest of your life.

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.432
I'm up for it.

01:32:07.981 --> 01:32:09.356
Oh, buddy.

01:32:11.193 --> 01:32:13.027
Okay, buddy. I've got
to go now because

01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:15.070
there's a job in there
that they want to give me.

01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:16.697
Go get it.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:26.540
Good luck.

01:32:26.625 --> 01:32:27.625
How do I look?

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:28.876
Amazing.

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:34.256
You look great. Nice buns!

01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:35.466
Shut up.

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:41.222
Deep breath.

01:32:41.306 --> 01:32:44.308
No matter what happens today
you are an amazing person.

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:48.729
The test does not have the power
to define you or validate you.

01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:50.940
What the fuck? Why do you
still have your Pouncer app?

01:32:51.024 --> 01:32:52.733
Why are you going
through my fucking phone?

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:53.901
I'm not!

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:56.779
You are! You're snooping because
you have major trust issues.

01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:58.072
Yes, I've got a lot of issues.

01:32:58.156 --> 01:33:00.366
Okay? No shit.
And this doesn't help.

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:03.577
I just didn't erase it, okay?
Not a big deal.

01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:06.538
- You promise?
- Yes, I promise.

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.708
Okay, you're going
to be great today.

01:33:09.793 --> 01:33:12.336
- You're going to be a great marshal.
- I know. Let's go.

01:33:44.119 --> 01:33:45.744
No, thank you!

01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:47.121
I'm with somebody!

01:33:47.205 --> 01:33:48.163
Excuse me?

01:33:48.248 --> 01:33:49.290
On the phone!

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:50.374
What?

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:54.336
Come back later, please! Office
hours don't start until next week!

01:33:54.421 --> 01:33:56.213
I'm sorry. I can't
hear you through the door!

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:58.549
Having trouble hearing you.
Hi! I'm Annie Bean.

01:33:59.884 --> 01:34:01.051
Sandy Osterman.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.721
Please? Come in.

01:34:12.105 --> 01:34:13.230
I'm sorry.

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:15.316
I have a medical condition.

01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:19.194
Are you okay?

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:21.239
Did you sleep in an outhouse
before you came here?

01:34:21.323 --> 01:34:25.242
No, I apologize. I know
I look unprofessional,

01:34:25.327 --> 01:34:26.660
and I shouldn't have
been covered in dirt.

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:28.287
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

01:34:28.371 --> 01:34:31.665
I was deflecting because I was
embarrassed about the smoke...

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:32.833
I...

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:36.962
My vaporizer was broke. It's not important.
Please, just come over and sit down.

01:34:37.047 --> 01:34:39.798
My sister Debby told me
how wonderful you were.

01:34:39.883 --> 01:34:41.133
Wait. You're Debby's brother?

01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:42.384
Yeah.

01:34:42.469 --> 01:34:46.221
That's funny. She kept referring
to you as she and her.

01:34:46.306 --> 01:34:48.266
She has thought that was
funny since we were nine.

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.727
That would make me
feel really marginalized.

01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:53.771
That's exactly how it felt.

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:56.482
I like you.

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:58.609
I think you should work here.

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:01.320
I would love to! Yes!

01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:03.113
I mean, definitely.
