WEBVTT

01:00.643 --> 01:05.148
-Dr. Jordan. A pleasure.
-It is kind of you to spare me the time.

01:08.109 --> 01:12.697
You saved the life of Grace Marks
against considerable odds.

01:12.781 --> 01:16.785
I'm curious to find out
exactly how you managed it.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.954
We lawyers always welcome
a chance to show off.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.665
But before we get down to it... Sherry?

01:22.749 --> 01:23.792
No, thank you.

01:23.875 --> 01:28.630
You acted for both Grace Marks
and James McDermott, I believe.

01:28.713 --> 01:32.759
Yes. That was wrong, in retrospect,
as their interests were in conflict.

01:32.842 --> 01:36.679
But the practice of jurisprudence
was so much laxer then.

01:38.556 --> 01:41.768
Why did McDermott take so long
to accuse Grace, I wonder?

01:41.851 --> 01:43.269
Well, until the very last,

01:43.353 --> 01:46.189
he was hoping for a commutation,
since she had been given one,

01:46.272 --> 01:49.567
and he could not accuse her without
knotting the noose around his own neck,

01:49.651 --> 01:52.237
'cause he'd have to admit to the axe play
and so forth.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.365
Whereas Grace could accuse him
with relative impunity.

01:55.448 --> 01:59.035
Just so.
Nor did she flinch when the moment came.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.620
Sauve qui peut.

02:01.454 --> 02:07.210
That woman has nerves like flint.
She'd have made a good lawyer, if a man.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.965
So you've met
Our Lady of the Silences?

02:12.048 --> 02:13.550
Is that what you call her?

02:16.177 --> 02:21.808
Yes. I've been spending a good deal
of time with her, trying to determine...

02:21.891 --> 02:23.476
Whether she's innocent?

02:24.227 --> 02:27.897
Whether she is insane.
Or was, at the time of the murders.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.733
Which I suppose is innocence of a kind.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.903
Well, I see our fascinating Grace
has been leading you on a merry chase.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.157
Not so merry.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.076
I must admit I've been baffled.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.663
What she says has the ring of truth.

02:43.746 --> 02:48.960
Her manner is sincere, yet I can't shake
the suspicion that in some way...

02:49.043 --> 02:51.504
I cannot put my finger on,
she is lying to me.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.589
Lying.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.049
A severe term, surely.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.136
Has she been lying to you, you ask?

02:59.429 --> 03:02.891
did Scheherazade lie?

03:02.974 --> 03:04.475
Not in her own eyes.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.854
Indeed, the stories that she told
ought never to be subjected

03:07.937 --> 03:10.106
to the harsh categories
of Truth or Falsehood.

03:10.189 --> 03:14.444
See, perhaps Grace Marks needed to be
telling you just what she told you

03:14.527 --> 03:16.154
in order to achieve the desired end.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.238
Which is?

03:19.365 --> 03:21.242
To keep the Sultan amused.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.328
To forestall your departure,

03:23.411 --> 03:25.747
make sure you'd stay with her
for as long as possible.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.667
What on earth would be the point in that?
Amusing me won't get her out of prison.

03:29.751 --> 03:33.046
Isn't it obvious? The poor creature
has fallen in love with you.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.716
A single man, more or less young,
not ill-favored,

03:36.799 --> 03:41.471
appears to someone so long sequestered,
deprived of masculine company.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.933
You are doubtless the object
of her waking daydreams.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.017
Surely not.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.228
I say surely so!

03:48.853 --> 03:51.773
I had the very experience myself,
or the twin of it.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.526
I had to pass many hours with her
in her jail cell in Toronto

03:55.610 --> 03:59.030
as she spun out her yarn for me
to as great a length as it would go.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.157
She was besotted with me.

04:01.241 --> 04:05.453
One hand placed on hers, she would have
thrown herself into my arms.

04:05.536 --> 04:06.579
Indeed?

04:07.330 --> 04:11.084
And I will admit I was tempted.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.544
I mean, she was very young
and tender then,

04:14.420 --> 04:17.548
though prison life has no doubt
hardened her.

04:22.303 --> 04:27.892
There has never been
any suggestion of that... in my case.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.400
Well, I was very lucky.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.319
As was Grace, in fact,

04:38.403 --> 04:41.155
that the Kinnear murder
was tried before the other.

04:41.239 --> 04:45.159
I mean, they had death sentences
pronounced on both of them for his murder

04:45.243 --> 04:47.912
and it was deemed unnecessary to go
through the details of the second case.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.124
So Grace was never even tried
for the murder of Nancy Montgomery.

04:51.207 --> 04:52.333
If she had been?

04:54.085 --> 04:55.878
I wouldn't have got her off.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.673
Public opinion would have been
too strong for me.

04:58.756 --> 04:59.841
She would have hanged.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.511
But in your opinion, she was innocent.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.223
On the contrary. No.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.727
In my opinion, she was guilty as sin.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.614
What were you doing in Toronto,
Dr. Jordan?

05:24.282 --> 05:27.243
Were you talking to people,
trying to find out if I was guilty?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.415
You wouldn't find it out that way.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.877
You don't understand yet
that guilt comes to you

05:35.960 --> 05:37.754
not from the things you have done,

05:37.837 --> 05:40.256
but from the things
others have done to you.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.551
You were getting thinner.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.429
I believed you were prey
to some nagging sorrow.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.354
Dr. Jordan.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.732
Grace. What have they done...?

06:11.412 --> 06:13.164
What have they done to your hair?

06:16.334 --> 06:18.878
I had too many marks
against me for talking.

06:34.602 --> 06:39.190
I have been thinking while you were away.
I've been thinking what I will tell you.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.483
I have been thinking too, Grace.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.695
I wonder if it's time we tried other
methods to access your memories.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.573
Dr. DuPont has said he is willing
to try hypnosis.

06:47.657 --> 06:52.078
All you have to do is sit in a chair and
go to sleep when Dr. DuPont tells you to.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.205
How will Jer--

06:55.957 --> 06:58.167
How will Dr. DuPont put me to sleep?

06:59.043 --> 07:01.170
He will explain all that tomorrow.

07:01.254 --> 07:05.466
I hope in this way
we'll bring back your memory.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.593
I am not sure I want it back.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.974
But if it will help,
I will do as you wish.

07:17.478 --> 07:23.025
Look. Lydia's left her keepsake album.
I wonder if she wanted you to find it.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.661
What would you put
in a keepsake album, Grace?

07:37.582 --> 07:40.710
A piece of cotton from
my penitentiary nightdress.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.548
A square of bloodstained petticoat.

07:48.676 --> 07:53.306
A strip of kerchief,
white with blue flowers.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.266
Love-in-a-mist.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.066
I will see you tomorrow, Grace.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.736
I will watch and listen.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.614
Yes, Doctor. I know you will.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.962
♪ I once was lost ♪

08:25.046 --> 08:28.216
♪ But now I'm found ♪

08:28.591 --> 08:34.680
♪ Was blind but now I see ♪

08:36.265 --> 08:38.851
I wonder if I was named after the hymn.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.189
I hope I was named after it.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.192
I would like to be found.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.694
I would like to see.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.030
Or be seen.

08:52.114 --> 08:56.285
I wonder if, in the eye of God,
it amounts to the same thing.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.122
As it says in the Bible,

09:00.206 --> 09:02.875
"For now we see through a glass,
darkly...

09:04.210 --> 09:06.045
but then face to face."

09:07.129 --> 09:11.175
If it is face to face,
there must be two looking.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.149
Alright.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.695
It is time.

09:39.036 --> 09:43.416
Well, I see that you are all assembled,
and may I say I am deeply gratified

09:43.499 --> 09:46.127
by both your interest and your trust.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.087
Grace, you may sit here.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.010
Are you quite comfortable?

09:55.219 --> 09:58.639
Grace, there is nothing to be afraid of.
No one here wishes you any harm.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.851
I have explained to Grace that she need
only listen to my voice

10:01.934 --> 10:03.519
and simply fall asleep.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.146
Is that understood, Grace?

10:07.273 --> 10:08.482
Very good.

10:09.025 --> 10:12.445
Now, this is a completely
scientific procedure.

10:12.528 --> 10:17.074
So I implore you to please banish
any and all thoughts of mesmerism

10:17.158 --> 10:19.452
or other such fraudulent acts.

10:19.535 --> 10:22.538
Please remain silent until
after Grace has fallen fully asleep,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.874
at which point you may
converse in low voices.

10:24.957 --> 10:29.253
Is that understood? Excellent.
Let us begin.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.429
Grace, you are getting heavy.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.684
Very, very heavy.

10:43.768 --> 10:49.982
Your limbs are of such a weight,
they are pulling you to the ground.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.610
You cannot move.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.035
Your eyelids are being weighed down.

11:01.869 --> 11:06.707
You are feeling drowsy.
Very, very drowsy.

11:07.667 --> 11:12.338
And now your limbs are floating, drifting.

11:12.421 --> 11:18.386
As you slowly sink down, down, down,
as if through water.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.853
Grace, can you still hear me?

11:27.937 --> 11:29.480
Yes.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.899
Good.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.984
Are you sleeping, Grace?

11:35.277 --> 11:36.529
Yes.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.863
Very good.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.450
When you awake,
you will remember nothing of this.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.663
Now, Grace, I want you to go deeper.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.541
And deeper.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.044
And deeper.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.174
Now, Grace, please lift up your right arm.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.515
Your arm is an iron bar,
which no one can bend.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.767
Would anyone care to try?

12:11.647 --> 12:12.982
No one?

12:14.358 --> 12:15.526
So be it.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.580
I am using all of my force.

12:33.544 --> 12:36.422
Very good, Grace. You may lower your arm.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.430
Her eyes are open.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.515
Which is normal and of no import.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.394
In this condition the subject may be able
to discern many things,

12:50.478 --> 12:51.979
even with their eyes fully closed.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.106
Shall we proceed?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.368
She looks so odd.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.662
It's to help
with the concentration.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.792
The inner sight, you see, is keener
when hidden from outward view.

13:15.044 --> 13:19.757
Well, Dr. Jordan, we may now travel
safely into the past.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.551
What is it exactly
that you would wish for me to ask her?

13:28.849 --> 13:30.726
Ask her about the Kinnear residence.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.895
Which part of it? One must be specific.

13:33.896 --> 13:34.897
The verandah.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.106
The verandah.

13:37.399 --> 13:43.906
Grace, you are now on the verandah
of the Kinnear home.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.951
What is it that you see?

13:51.205 --> 13:52.915
I see flowers.

13:53.707 --> 13:54.959
The sunset.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.838
I am so happy. I want to stay here.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.091
Ask her to get up
and walk into the house.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.142
Tell her to go towards the trapdoor
in the hall,

14:12.226 --> 14:14.019
the one leading to the cellar.

14:16.188 --> 14:20.025
Grace,
go into the Kinnear home.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.327
It's like there's a spirit
in the room.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.664
-I'm frightened. Open the drapes!
-Not yet.

14:33.747 --> 14:37.167
You must maintain your composure.
I beg of you. This is not a seance.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.755
Shall we press on?

14:41.839 --> 14:44.717
Ask her whether she had relations
with James McDermott.

14:47.970 --> 14:51.599
Grace. Did you ever have relations
with James McDermott?

14:53.934 --> 14:56.186
Relations?

14:57.605 --> 14:59.398
What do you mean?

15:01.483 --> 15:04.987
Really, Doctor, you're such a hypocrite!

15:06.196 --> 15:07.907
You want to know if I kissed him,

15:07.990 --> 15:10.993
if I slept with him,
if I was his paramour, is that it?

15:13.245 --> 15:14.413
Yes.

15:14.496 --> 15:18.083
Whether I did what you'd like to do with
that slut who's got hold of your hand?

15:22.004 --> 15:25.007
You'd like to know that, so I'll tell you.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.259
Yes.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.679
I would meet him outside, in the yard.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.977
I'd press up against him

15:37.061 --> 15:39.730
and let him kiss me
and touch me all over, Doctor,

15:39.813 --> 15:43.567
the same places you'd like to touch me,
because I can always tell.

15:43.651 --> 15:48.030
I know what you're thinking when you sit
in that stuffy sewing room with me.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.158
That was all, Doctor.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.118
That was all I'd let him do.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.581
I had him on a string,
and Mr. Kinnear as well.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.833
I had the two of them dancing to my tune!

16:01.001 --> 16:02.378
Ask her why.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.714
I would breathe like this.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.805
I would twist and twine.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.183
After that, he'd say he'd do anything.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.603
But why?

16:19.687 --> 16:24.274
Oh, Doctor, you're always asking why.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.612
Poking your nose in,
and not only your nose.

16:29.279 --> 16:32.449
You're such a curious man, Doctor.
Curiosity killed the cat, you know.

16:32.533 --> 16:36.495
Watch out for that little mouse beside you
and her little furry mouse hole, too.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.582
This is an outrage.
Lydia, come with me!

16:40.666 --> 16:43.210
Modesty must take second place
to the interests of science.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.129
-Please remain seated.
-But this is a spirit.

16:45.212 --> 16:48.132
This is a spirit that has taken hold
of Grace, this is not science.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.092
I must insist on quiet!

16:50.175 --> 16:54.263
Ask her if she was in the cellar
of Mr. Kinnear's house

16:54.346 --> 16:57.016
on Friday the 28th of July, 1843.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.351
Grace, the cellar.

17:00.394 --> 17:05.274
Picture the cellar.
Go back in time, descend in space.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.830
Yes.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.375
Along the hallway...

17:25.169 --> 17:27.212
lift the trapdoor...

17:28.297 --> 17:31.216
down the cellar stairs.

17:38.140 --> 17:43.312
Barrels, whisky, vegetables
in boxes full of sand.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.523
There on the floor.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.318
Yes, I was in the cellar.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.112
Ask her if Nancy was there.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.534
Oh, yes, I saw her.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.497
As I can see you, Doctor.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.291
And I can hear you too.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.876
Was she alive?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.169
Was she still alive?

18:07.252 --> 18:09.505
She was partly alive.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.757
Or partly dead.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.928
She needed to be put out of her misery.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.938
Did you help strangle her?

18:27.064 --> 18:31.151
It was my kerchief that strangled her.
Such a pretty pattern it had on it!

18:31.235 --> 18:35.114
It was a shame to lose that kerchief.
I'd had it such a long time.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.615
It was my mother's.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.951
I should have taken it off Nancy's neck.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.329
But James wouldn't let me have it,
nor her gold earrings neither.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.624
There was blood on it,
but that would have washed out.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.459
You killed her.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.337
I always thought so.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.466
Give me the handkerchief!

19:10.315 --> 19:11.608
The kerchief killed her.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.902
Hands held it.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.697
She had to die.
The wages of sin is death.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.437
Grace, I thought better of you.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.190
All these years you've deceived us.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.694
You've deceived yourselves.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.655
I am not Grace.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.584
Stop. Stop.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.058
Grace knew nothing about it.

20:37.736 --> 20:41.114
♪ Let the water and the blood ♪

20:41.698 --> 20:45.577
♪ From the riven side which flowed ♪

20:45.661 --> 20:46.745
I killed her.

20:46.828 --> 20:51.041
♪ Rock of ages, cleft for me ♪

20:51.959 --> 20:55.671
♪ Let me hide myself in thee ♪

20:57.673 --> 21:01.593
You are not Grace.
If you are not Grace, then who are you?

21:01.677 --> 21:04.096
-You must answer. I command it!
-You can't command. You must guess.

21:04.179 --> 21:07.516
Spirits speak through others, in a trance,
but sometimes they lie, you know.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.976
I am not lying.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.644
I am beyond lying.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.939
It may be James McDermott,
come to accuse Grace.

21:14.022 --> 21:18.277
-Not James, you old fraud.
-Please, Mrs. Quenell, this is no spirit.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.822
I believe what we are witnessing right now
is a purely natural phenomenon.

21:21.905 --> 21:24.700
Nancy then. The spirits are often rude,
they call us names.

21:24.783 --> 21:28.078
- Some cannot tolerate to be dead.
- Not Nancy, you stupid fool!

21:28.161 --> 21:32.207
Nancy can't say a word,
not with her neck like that.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.293
Such a pretty neck, once!

21:35.043 --> 21:39.923
But Nancy isn't angry anymore.
She understands.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.592
Nancy is my friend.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.845
She wants to share things.

21:47.764 --> 21:52.561
Come, Doctor, you like riddles.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.230
You know the answer.

21:55.897 --> 22:00.277
I told you it was my kerchief,
the one I gave to Grace,

22:00.360 --> 22:02.529
the one she kept with her after I...

22:04.156 --> 22:10.537
♪ Oh no, 'twas the truth in her eye
ever dawning ♪

22:10.620 --> 22:15.709
♪ That made me love Mary ♪

22:16.501 --> 22:17.586
Mary...

22:17.669 --> 22:19.171
Not Mary Whitney.

22:19.254 --> 22:22.632
I told James to do it.
I was there all along!

22:22.716 --> 22:23.884
-There?
-Here.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.429
Where I am now, with Grace.

22:28.805 --> 22:32.392
I was so cold, lying on that floor.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.145
And I was alone.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.814
I needed to keep warm.

22:38.398 --> 22:41.026
But Grace doesn't know, she's never known!

22:42.069 --> 22:45.572
They almost hanged her,
that would have been wrong.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.450
I only borrowed her clothing for a time.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.786
-Her clothing?
-Her earthly shell.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.455
Her fleshly garment.

22:53.538 --> 22:57.584
She forgot to open the window,
so I couldn't get out.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.296
But I wouldn't want to hurt her.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.381
You mustn't tell her.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.175
-Why?
-You know why, Doctor.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.677
Do you want to see her back in the asylum?

23:07.761 --> 23:10.180
I liked it there at first.
I could talk out loud.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.766
I could share things.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.645
But they didn't believe me.

23:17.813 --> 23:18.939
They wouldn't listen.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.149
I was not heard.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.819
Grace. Stop playing tricks!

23:23.902 --> 23:26.363
- I am not Grace.
- Is that really you?

23:27.197 --> 23:30.283
Don't be afraid. Speak the truth.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.786
You see?

23:34.371 --> 23:36.164
You're all the same.

23:36.248 --> 23:42.295
You won't listen,
you don't believe me, you won't hear.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.221
She's gone. You can always tell
when they go back to their own realm.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.974
You can feel it in the air.
It's the electricity.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.476
Grace.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.020
Grace Marks, can you still hear me?

24:01.356 --> 24:02.357
Yes.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.442
Good.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.945
I'm going to bring you up now.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.368
Grace, you are now lighter than air.

24:13.451 --> 24:17.539
Nothing is weighing you down
as you float up, up.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.624
Up, up, out of the depths.

24:19.708 --> 24:23.837
You see the light above you as you break
the surface of the present.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.133
When I snap my fingers,
you will be fully awake.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.403
I must have been asleep.

24:49.362 --> 24:53.450
Do you remember anything?
Anything of what has just happened here?

24:54.201 --> 24:55.202
No.

24:57.871 --> 24:58.872
I was asleep.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.668
But I must have been dreaming.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.755
I dreamt of my mother.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.716
Floating in the sea.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.886
She was at peace.

25:18.934 --> 25:22.479
You may feel a little dizzy.
Frequently the case.

25:22.562 --> 25:26.650
Mrs. Quenell, see that Grace is brought to
a bedchamber where she may lie down.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.035
Ladies and gentlemen, I am at a loss.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.955
I believe that these
are two distinct personalities,

25:40.038 --> 25:42.958
which both coexist within the same body

25:43.041 --> 25:45.835
and yet have different sets
of memories altogether.

25:45.919 --> 25:50.131
They are, for all practical purposes,
two entirely separate individuals.

25:50.215 --> 25:54.594
If you'll accept, that is,
that we are what we remember.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.263
Perhaps.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.182
But we are also, preponderantly,
what we forget.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.143
The other voice,
whatever it was, was...

26:03.645 --> 26:05.438
remarkable for its violence.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.316
Dr. Jordan, what will you say about this
in your report?

26:08.400 --> 26:11.152
I shall have to consider
my position very carefully.

26:12.570 --> 26:15.907
I have always believed Grace to be
innocent, or hoped, rather.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.786
But if what we have witnessed
is a natural phenomenon,

26:19.869 --> 26:21.705
then who are we to question it?

26:21.788 --> 26:25.125
Was she really in a trance or play-acting
and laughing up her sleeve?

26:25.208 --> 26:28.670
I know what I saw and heard, but she may
have been showing us an illusion.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.922
-I take great exception to this.
-No. If I describe

26:31.006 --> 26:35.010
what I witnessed in my report
and it found its way into any petition

26:35.093 --> 26:38.138
submitted on her behalf, it would
immediately scotch any chance of success.

26:38.221 --> 26:41.474
-Dr. Jordan, let us think more on this.
-I cannot write the report you desire

26:41.558 --> 26:42.684
without perjuring myself.

26:42.767 --> 26:46.021
The safest thing to do would be
to write nothing at all.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.607
But those hours you spent with Grace
must add up to much more than--

26:49.691 --> 26:53.486
The fact is I can't state anything
with certainty and still tell the truth,

26:53.570 --> 26:55.238
because the truth eludes me.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.742
Or Grace eludes me.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.452
Dr. Jordan, please reconsider.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.121
I always wanted to do that
with someone else.

27:46.373 --> 27:47.916
Not you.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.613
Dear Reverend Verringer.

28:19.364 --> 28:23.701
The experience of witnessing what we saw
together in the governor's parlor

28:23.785 --> 28:28.331
has raised many questions for me
about hypnotism and mesmerism.

28:28.915 --> 28:33.169
I wonder if they provide an opportunity
for women to say what they think

28:33.837 --> 28:37.090
and to express their true thoughts
and feelings more boldly

28:37.173 --> 28:41.136
and in more vulgar terms than
they could otherwise feel permission to.

28:41.886 --> 28:46.057
I wonder about Grace's violent childhood
and her experience as a young woman,

28:48.101 --> 28:51.479
abused constantly, harassed on every side.

28:53.148 --> 28:57.026
I wonder how much repressed rage she must
have carried with her as a result.

28:58.987 --> 29:03.450
The question is, was this rage directed
toward Nancy Montgomery

29:03.533 --> 29:05.785
and Thomas Kinnear,
resulting in their murder?

29:06.703 --> 29:08.163
Or at me,

29:08.246 --> 29:12.542
therefore making her confession during
her hypnotism a fraud designed to hurt me?

29:14.627 --> 29:16.463
One thing is certain.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.049
I cannot write a report
for your committee.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.677
I must forget Grace Marks.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.641
He will not be
returning to Kingston. He is gone.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.770
When I heard you
went off so quick,

29:31.853 --> 29:33.563
and without sending any word to me,

29:33.646 --> 29:35.732
I was very distressed, Dr. Jordan.

29:36.357 --> 29:40.236
I could not understand it,
that you would go without a goodbye,

29:40.320 --> 29:43.198
after all the talking
we had done together.

29:45.074 --> 29:48.536
They also said you were to write a letter
to the government on my behalf,

29:48.620 --> 29:50.246
to set me free,

29:50.330 --> 29:53.166
and I became afraid that now
you would not do so.

29:55.001 --> 30:00.089
I remembered when Jeremiah claimed to see
into the future after looking at my palm

30:03.843 --> 30:06.554
and said that all would come out
well in the end.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.350
And I wondered if he was
only trying to comfort me.

30:13.978 --> 30:17.690
I was afraid of falling into hopeless
despair over my wasted life,

30:18.983 --> 30:21.778
and I was still not sure how it happened.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.618
Dear Reverend Verringer.

30:28.701 --> 30:32.372
I must admit that I have come very close
to nervous exhaustion

30:32.455 --> 30:35.625
during the last two years
since I was in Kingston.

30:35.708 --> 30:36.918
Thank you, Mother.

30:37.001 --> 30:41.339
Not to know,
to snatch at hints and portents,

30:42.257 --> 30:43.967
at tantalizing whispers.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.135
It is as bad as being haunted.

30:46.886 --> 30:50.223
Sometimes at night her face
floats before me in the dark,

30:50.306 --> 30:54.185
like some lovely and enigmatic mirage.

30:58.314 --> 31:02.026
I have intimations
of some vast discovery still,

31:02.110 --> 31:06.531
though as yet I wander in darkness,
led only by marsh-lights.

31:06.614 --> 31:07.699
Murderess.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.330
I'm almost thankful that the prospect
for a peaceful resolution

31:14.414 --> 31:17.083
between North and South is not hopeful,

31:17.166 --> 31:21.504
as it will be a relief to have a duty
of some kind set before me,

31:21.588 --> 31:24.799
no matter how deplorable
the occasion for it.

31:26.134 --> 31:32.307
Your brain-sore and weary
but affectionate friend, Simon.

31:38.646 --> 31:43.234
Grace, I have the most astonishing news.
Your pardon has come through.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.571
From Sir John Macdonald
and the Minister of Justice in Ottawa.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.907
Isn't it wonderful?

31:50.408 --> 31:52.076
Is it not a cruel joke?

31:52.160 --> 31:55.079
Oh, no. It is really true.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.748
You are pardoned!

32:04.172 --> 32:05.924
It was strange to realize

32:06.007 --> 32:08.593
that I would not be
a celebrated murderess anymore,

32:08.676 --> 32:13.514
but seen perhaps as an innocent woman
wrongly accused and imprisoned unjustly

32:14.557 --> 32:18.269
and an object of pity
rather than of horror and fear.

32:19.145 --> 32:22.357
It took me some days
to get used to the idea.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.360
It calls for a different
arrangement of the face.

32:30.156 --> 32:33.701
I wished to turn and look back,
but I remembered Lot's wife.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.037
I did indeed have a sort of regret.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.832
For the penitentiary was the only home
I'd known for almost 30 years.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.669
To go from a familiar thing
into the unknown

32:42.752 --> 32:45.421
is always a matter for apprehension,

32:45.505 --> 32:49.008
and I suppose that is why
so many people are afraid to die.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.429
May I ask about the home
I am to be a servant in?

32:54.514 --> 32:56.516
What has the household been told about me?

32:56.599 --> 32:58.935
There is a surprise awaiting you, Grace.

32:59.018 --> 33:02.105
I cannot tell you what it is,
but it is a good surprise.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.693
I will tell you that it concerns a man,
a gentleman.

33:07.568 --> 33:08.695
What gentleman?

33:09.153 --> 33:10.655
I cannot tell you.

33:10.738 --> 33:13.241
But he is an old friend of yours.

33:15.201 --> 33:19.330
The only gentleman I could think of,
sir, was you yourself.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.785
Here's our man.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.923
Grace, don't you know me?
I would have known you anywhere.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.969
Jamie Walsh.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.057
We'll give you two
a moment to yourselves.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.976
The last time I saw you at...

34:23.728 --> 34:26.731
It was your testimony that changed
the minds of the judge and jury

34:26.814 --> 34:28.024
so much against me.

34:29.442 --> 34:33.571
I've been overcome with guilt for the part
I played in your conviction.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.908
I was only a young lad at the time
and no match for the lawyers.

34:36.991 --> 34:39.452
They led me into saying things.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.748
It's alright, Jamie.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.418
You needn't feel guilty anymore.

34:48.711 --> 34:50.838
It's the sort of thing
that could happen to anyone.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.304
I beg you to forgive me.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.225
You're forgiven.

35:06.187 --> 35:09.565
Grace, this is my farm now. It's mine.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.319
Although I'm not a millionaire,
I can offer you a good home.

35:13.402 --> 35:17.073
In this country you are not judged by what
you come from, but by what you have.

35:17.156 --> 35:19.408
I do not want you
to marry me out of guilt.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.830
I have always had very warm feelings
for you, Grace.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.228
Alright then.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.959
It has been many years
since I was 16 years of age

36:10.042 --> 36:12.920
and first went up
the long driveway to Mr. Kinnear's.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.549
Now I am on my own verandah,

36:16.632 --> 36:20.887
and the scene before me is so peaceful,
you would think it was a picture.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.018
We have white and red Leghorns

36:27.101 --> 36:29.729
and a Jersey cow for the cream and cheese.

36:29.812 --> 36:31.105
There is nothing better.

36:32.607 --> 36:36.444
We have two horses, Charley and Nell,
who are a great pleasure to me,

36:36.527 --> 36:38.988
and good company
when Mr. Walsh is not here.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.448
Our cat is named Tabby.

36:41.407 --> 36:44.243
She is the color you might expect
and a good mouser.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.412
-And a dog named Rex.
-And a dog named Rex.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.766
Mr. Walsh wanted to employ a girl as well,

37:06.849 --> 37:10.269
but I said I would prefer to do the work
of the house myself.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.897
I wouldn't want to have
a servant living in,

37:12.980 --> 37:16.275
as they pry too much
and listen at doors.

37:35.836 --> 37:39.674
I know my secrets are safe with Jeremiah,
as his are safe with me.

37:43.469 --> 37:48.766
On the whole, Mr. Walsh and I agree,
and things go on very well with us.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.477
But there is something
that has troubled me, sir.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.939
It is one of the reasons I have
written you this long letter.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.023
It is this.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.609
To think of the sufferings
I have caused you.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.072
You did not cause me
any sufferings, Jamie.

38:03.155 --> 38:05.408
It was the others that caused them.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.078
Also having plain bad luck
and bad judgement.

38:10.413 --> 38:14.333
Tell me again.
Tell me again about the lunatic asylum.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.420
Tell me again how you were ill-treated.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.303
Often the doctor would visit.

38:26.470 --> 38:30.641
He would put his hand up my leg.
He said it was to check my progress.

38:32.601 --> 38:35.021
He likes to picture the sufferings
I have endured.

38:43.195 --> 38:47.533
He listens to all of it like a child
listening to a fairy tale.

38:47.616 --> 38:50.870
I must confess that it reminds me
of you, Dr. Jordan.

38:51.746 --> 38:55.583
You were as eager as Mr. Walsh to hear
about my sufferings in life.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.711
Your cheeks would flush,
and if you'd had ears like a dog,

38:58.794 --> 39:00.838
they would have been pricked forward,

39:00.921 --> 39:04.133
with your eyes shining
and your tongue hanging out,

39:04.216 --> 39:06.719
as if you'd found a grouse in a bush.

39:06.802 --> 39:12.141
And as with Mr. Walsh, I may have changed
some of the details of my stories

39:12.224 --> 39:14.477
to suit what I thought you wanted to hear.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.689
It did make me feel
I was of some use in this world.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.276
Could you ever forgive me?

39:22.360 --> 39:27.156
He insists on being forgiven, and who am I
to refuse him such a simple thing?

39:31.035 --> 39:34.413
I had a rage in my heart for many years
against Mary Whitney.

39:35.164 --> 39:37.625
And especially against Nancy Montgomery.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.170
Against the two of them both for letting
themselves be done to death

39:41.253 --> 39:42.671
in the way that they did.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.008
So I don't feel quite right about it,
forgiving him like that,

39:46.092 --> 39:50.012
because I am aware that in doing so
I am telling a lie.

39:50.679 --> 39:53.557
Though I suppose it isn't
the first lie I've told.

39:54.266 --> 39:55.768
As Mary Whitney used to say,

39:55.851 --> 39:59.814
a little white lie is a small price to pay
for peace and quiet.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.277
How is he doing?

40:06.362 --> 40:08.697
Have you seen any progress
since last time?

40:08.781 --> 40:12.952
He still has no memory of recent events.
I see no improvement in his speech.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.871
It has been years now since your son
was wounded, Mrs. Jordan.

40:15.955 --> 40:18.958
I believe this will be
his permanent state.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.335
I wish I had better news to share.

40:22.837 --> 40:26.048
I don't believe my visits
are of any use at this point.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.428
Thank you, Doctor.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.274
Simon.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.569
Simon, how are you feeling today?

41:08.799 --> 41:11.469
I think of Mary Whitney
frequently these days,

41:12.678 --> 41:15.431
and of the time we threw
the apple peelings over our shoulders,

41:16.182 --> 41:18.642
and it has all come true after a fashion.

41:19.477 --> 41:23.147
Just as she said, I married a man
whose name begins with a "J,"

41:23.230 --> 41:26.108
and as Jeremiah said way back then,

41:26.192 --> 41:28.611
I first had to cross over water
three times,

41:28.694 --> 41:30.696
and all will be fine in the end.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.908
And I really am here.

41:34.617 --> 41:39.121
I open and shut my eyes and pinch myself,
but it remains true.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.292
Although I have made many quilts
in my day,

41:43.375 --> 41:46.295
I am finally making one for myself.

41:46.378 --> 41:49.965
The pattern of this quilt
is called the Tree of Paradise

41:50.674 --> 41:53.844
and I am changing it a little
to suit my own ideas.

41:56.555 --> 42:00.476
On my Tree of Paradise,
I intend to put a border of snakes.

42:01.352 --> 42:05.189
Without a snake or two, the main part
of the story would be missing.

42:06.398 --> 42:08.901
The Tree itself is of triangles,
in two colors,

42:09.568 --> 42:12.696
dark for the leaves
and a lighter color for the fruits.

42:13.614 --> 42:16.825
But three of the triangles
in my Tree will be different.

42:16.909 --> 42:21.956
One will be red, from the petticoat
I still have that was Mary Whitney's.

42:23.207 --> 42:27.586
One will be faded yellowish,
from my prison nightdress.

42:29.046 --> 42:34.051
And the third will be a pale pink cotton,
cut from the dress of Nancy's

42:34.134 --> 42:37.137
that she had on the first day
I was at Mr. Kinnear's

42:37.221 --> 42:39.640
and that I wore when I was running away.

42:43.018 --> 42:48.232
I will embroider around each one of them,
to blend them in as part of the pattern.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.571
And so we will all be together.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.085
"And so we will all be together."

43:19.805 --> 43:21.140
