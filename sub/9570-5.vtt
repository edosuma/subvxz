Er, hi. I want to arrange
an appointment.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.100
Where you at?

00:18.100 --> 00:19.980
44 Hillingdon Drive.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.940
All right. Ten minutes.

00:29.660 --> 00:33.061
<i>One thing I've learnt
is that you should never look back.</i>

00:34.260 --> 00:37.180
<i>The past is dead and buried.
You get nothing from living there.</i>

00:37.180 --> 00:39.316
<i>It's all about today.</i>

00:44.340 --> 00:46.970
<i>But I've been having these dreams.</i>

00:48.460 --> 00:49.940
<i>In them, nothing's real.</i>

00:49.940 --> 00:52.660
<i>Nothing's solid,
everything's fantasy.</i>

00:52.660 --> 00:54.260
<i>Fucked.</i>

00:54.260 --> 00:56.706
<i>An illusion.</i>

<i>In these dreams,
I'm a life that's already gone by.</i>

01:10.940 --> 01:12.340
Get in, mate...

01:12.340 --> 01:15.700
<i>Today means nothing.</i>

01:15.700 --> 01:17.340
What you after...?

01:17.340 --> 01:21.340
<i>Today is just a ghost
that's haunting me.</i>

01:26.380 --> 01:29.305
Ugh!

01:33.060 --> 01:34.700
Agh!

01:34.700 --> 01:38.307
You really are
fucking stupid, aren't you? Eh?

01:45.140 --> 01:46.220
Yeah?

01:46.220 --> 01:50.682
- 'Yeah, you got something for me?'
- Same spot, mate.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.380
<i>I'm at the end of the world,
on the edge of things,</i>

01:54.380 --> 01:55.820

01:55.820 --> 01:58.700
Hey, gorgeous.
Got some sweeties for me?

01:58.700 --> 02:01.057
<i>I think about falling.</i>

02:10.139 --> 02:12.807
<i>My name is James Cook.</i>

02:15.660 --> 02:17.743

02:57.910 --> 02:59.970
I told you not to come here.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.220
I'm not fucking ya,

03:05.220 --> 03:08.252
so either buy some
petrol or fuck off.

03:11.660 --> 03:14.345
What, so I'm a fucking
crack whore now?

03:15.220 --> 03:17.057
I'm not fucking ya.

03:21.980 --> 03:23.660
I'm not fucking ya.

03:29.780 --> 03:33.780
Ah! Ah, yeah!

03:41.020 --> 03:42.518
Oh!

03:49.660 --> 03:50.999
Ems...

03:52.900 --> 03:54.580
I need somewhere to stay.

03:55.366 --> 03:58.300
Ah, come on, man. When are
you going to get your own place?

03:58.300 --> 04:00.980
What's the point? The point
is, we don't live together.

04:01.424 --> 04:03.730
I'm just a bit sick of
sleeping in me car, that's all.

04:06.900 --> 04:10.515
I'll be home in four hours.

04:10.593 --> 04:13.260
You can stay, yeah, until I get back.

04:13.260 --> 04:16.745
All right. Cheers.

04:19.940 --> 04:22.491
Cheeky cunt.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.978
Bop! Bop!

04:36.500 --> 04:38.980
Ha-ha-ha! Cook,
man, what's happening?

04:38.980 --> 04:40.980
- How many so far?
- Three.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.220
Oof! Eight, man. Eight!

04:43.220 --> 04:44.980
Got nearly a G in the bank already.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.140
You need to start
playing catch-up, kid!

04:47.140 --> 04:50.420
Right, get to it, then, lad.
The night is young and so are we.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.180
Look after yourself, lad.

05:29.554 --> 05:32.762
<i>Once you run,
you get used to being scared.</i>

05:33.420 --> 05:36.110
<i>I don't even notice it any more.</i>

05:38.100 --> 05:40.241
<i>A background hum.</i>

05:42.140 --> 05:43.580
<i>But sometimes it gets loud,</i>

05:43.580 --> 05:46.480
<i>like someone's turned
the volume right up.</i>

05:51.220 --> 05:54.420
<i>You've got to feel it,
really feel it.</i>

05:54.420 --> 05:55.980
<i>Accept it.</i>

05:55.980 --> 05:57.940
<i>And then it's just noise again.</i>

05:57.940 --> 06:00.900
<i>- But you'll never stop hearing it.</i>

06:00.900 --> 06:03.780
<i>- Not ever.</i>

06:03.780 --> 06:05.460
Police!

06:08.180 --> 06:09.420
Wake up!

06:09.420 --> 06:11.460
Oh... fuck's sake!

06:11.460 --> 06:14.700
All right, I'm up! I'm up.

06:15.231 --> 06:17.453
Fucking 'ell.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.780
Hiya. I've told you,
you don't need to double-lock.

06:23.780 --> 06:27.093
What do you think's going to happen?

06:31.260 --> 06:32.940
You look like shit.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.228
Yeah, it's early, innit?

06:36.980 --> 06:39.140
You got to go, Cook. I need to sleep.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.541
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.651
All right. I'm off.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.620
Do I at least get a kiss?

07:42.300 --> 07:44.741
No, Cook, you got to go.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.431
All right.

08:13.638 --> 08:15.969
All right, guys?
What you after?

08:16.520 --> 08:19.520
- Er, what do we want again?
- I want one, yeah.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.040
No, you want two, I want one.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.200
Right, and I
want two, so that's...

08:23.200 --> 08:25.400
That maths GCSE paying off, Susie?!

08:25.400 --> 08:28.200
Oh, fuck off, Norman.
Erm, four, please.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.200
I actually think I've only
got enough for... one.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.720
Oh, my God, why do you have to
make everything so complicated?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.400
- I'm not making this complicated.
- Yeah, you are. You're being an idiot. I'm trying...

08:35.400 --> 08:37.520
I've got enough for one!

08:37.520 --> 08:39.799
Guys, guys, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey!

08:39.799 --> 08:41.530
How much have you got?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.520
Thank you. Ta.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.200
OK, so you've got enough for one...

08:46.200 --> 08:48.440
Four and three-quarters.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.640
Good maths!
But I... I don't do quarters, so...

08:51.640 --> 08:54.920
You look after that,
sweetheart. And them.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.050
- Cheers. All right, you happy?
- Yeah.

08:57.075 --> 08:57.999
You guys, you happy?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.262
- Yeah, thanks.
- All right, piss off, then.

09:07.200 --> 09:11.200
Fucking kids.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.200
One...

09:42.200 --> 09:44.920

09:44.920 --> 09:46.120

09:46.120 --> 09:48.200

09:48.200 --> 09:52.200

09:54.120 --> 09:56.560
- Ey up, Louie.
- 'Cook, where you at, man?'

09:56.560 --> 09:58.320
Just in the park, mate,
on some gym shit.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.880
'Pumping iron, yeah?! Listen, d'you
reckon you could come round?'

10:01.880 --> 10:02.782
Yeah, all right.

10:02.807 --> 10:04.807
'Awesome.
Could you pick up some stuff on the way?'

10:04.840 --> 10:06.840
Stuff? You mean stuff-stuff?

10:06.840 --> 10:09.240
'I mean eggs, bacon, milk, bread.
For breakfast.'

10:09.240 --> 10:10.400
Ah, OK. Yeah, all right.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.000
'Get a receipt, yeah?'

10:32.560 --> 10:34.000
All right, mate.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Ah, fuck you! Fuck you!

10:40.960 --> 10:43.240
Fuck you! Fuck you!

10:45.480 --> 10:47.640
Ah, fuck!

10:47.640 --> 10:48.880
Ah, fuck it.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.640
Louie...

10:50.640 --> 10:54.280
Cook man! Good to see ya!

10:54.280 --> 10:55.520
Ah, yeah.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.760
How's it diddling, buddy?
You all right?

10:57.760 --> 10:59.720
Did you bring the bacon?

10:59.720 --> 11:02.840
This guy... Straight down
the line, no fucking about.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.200
Right, Cooko?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.560
Right.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.400
Well, I could def
go for full English.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.360
Rob, d'you mind doing the honours?

11:09.360 --> 11:13.360
Yeah, yeah. Give
it here, Cook, mate. Aye.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.480
Ah, shit. Erm...

11:15.480 --> 11:18.480
Right, listen. My girlfriend's coming
back from Newport any second -

11:18.480 --> 11:20.480
you've got to skedaddle. OK?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.800
Thank you very much. Bye!

11:21.800 --> 11:23.960
All right, Jesus!

11:23.960 --> 11:27.960
Sit down.

11:32.187 --> 11:36.640
Speakin' of the fairer sex,
Cooko, I need a favour off you.

11:36.640 --> 11:37.720
Yeah?

11:37.720 --> 11:40.320
Yeah, well, the thing is,
I'm well busy ATM,

11:40.320 --> 11:43.040
with the party imminent and whatnot,
and the missus,

11:43.040 --> 11:45.880
she needs someone to drive her
about the next day or so.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.640
We're buying a house, see,
and she's got viewings and whatever

11:49.640 --> 11:50.960
and all that other girlie shit.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.240
What about my rounds?

11:52.224 --> 11:55.784
Ah, Jason's got that covered.
You can miss a day. So...

11:55.800 --> 11:59.520
- you got my back?
- Yeah, I got you, Louie. Whatever you want.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.280
My boy! So fucking straight!
Down the line!

12:02.280 --> 12:03.640
Straight. No fucking about.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.760
Bam! That's you.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.920
Ah, it's the girl herself!

12:06.920 --> 12:08.360
You all right, Charlie?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.560
That is the last time -
the last time -

12:10.560 --> 12:13.040
I am going to fucking
Wales, you hear me?

12:13.040 --> 12:15.160
Newport is a fucking shit hole.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.600
I'm telling you,
Louie, never again.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.760
All right, all right.

12:19.760 --> 12:23.520
Babe, chill. Did you get it OK?

12:23.520 --> 12:27.520
Yeah, yeah. All in there,
same as always. Cool.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.760
Mmm!

12:33.760 --> 12:35.120
You did good, darlin'.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.720
Yeah, yeah. Fuck you.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.115
Thank you.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.680
Newport, eh?

12:51.680 --> 12:53.560
I don't mind, really.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.040
When you look like I do,

12:55.040 --> 12:58.440
I could be smuggling anthrax cut with
Bin Laden's pubes in my vagina -

12:58.440 --> 13:00.792
no-one would stop me.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.245
So you're going to
be my Driving Miss Daisy?

13:08.316 --> 13:09.417
Yes, ma'am.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.800
So you'll see immediately
that there's lots of space.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.880
Lots of light.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.318
It's massive!

13:51.920 --> 13:53.955
Right this way.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.280
You can enjoy complete privacy.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.320
Ah, yeah, I can
even go skinny-dipping.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.000
Well, yes.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.600
Ah, it's warm!

14:12.600 --> 14:15.000
- Well, it's heated.
- How much?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.640
- Sorry?
- For the house, how much?

14:16.640 --> 14:19.160
Can you give us a moment?

14:19.160 --> 14:21.760
I just want to talk it
through with my boyfriend.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.560
Oh, yes, of course.
Take as much time as you like -

14:24.560 --> 14:27.072
I'll be out in my car
when you've finished.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.120
What are you doing?
Trying before buying it.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.200
Oh, I don't think that you should...

14:40.200 --> 14:41.480
Whoo!

14:42.760 --> 14:45.080
Oh, my God!
It's really fucking awesome!

14:45.080 --> 14:47.040
- You should get in here!
- Nah.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.120
Oh, come on! It's warm.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.760
I'm all right.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.520
Oh, Come on.
Have fun for once in your life.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.640
No, man, listen!

14:55.640 --> 14:59.360
I'm not some fuckin'...

14:59.360 --> 15:02.360
Just no.

15:02.360 --> 15:06.360
All right. Jeez.

15:09.773 --> 15:11.196
- Turn around.
- Hmm?

15:11.221 --> 15:15.221
I'm wearing lace.
It's wet. Turn around.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.120
- What's with you, Cook?
- What do you mean?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.309
I... Oh, turn around,
for fuck's sake.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.796
I want to know what's with you.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.160
No.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.960
- No, nothing's with me.
- Well, there is.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.236
Something's going on.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.160
- What happened to you?
- You think, because I don't want

15:39.160 --> 15:41.640
to come swimming with you,
that I've got something to hide?

15:41.640 --> 15:43.000
I'm thinking that, once,

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
you would've jumped in
without a second thought. Right?

15:49.760 --> 15:53.520
All that down-the-line shit
that Louie's going on about...

15:53.574 --> 15:55.203
it's bollocks, isn't it?

15:58.080 --> 15:59.480
It's no good for you, you know.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.480
What? What you're doing.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.120
What's this?

16:11.120 --> 16:14.640
I'm never wrong
about this shit, Cook.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.474
Tell me what happened to you.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.317
No.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.760
I know Louie's cheating on me.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.595
I don't care!

16:46.400 --> 16:48.560
Just drop me here.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.560
- Don't you want to go home?
- Nope.

17:00.560 --> 17:04.560
Do me a favour. Don't tell
Louie you dropped me here.

17:06.440 --> 17:10.440
Well, how you going to get home?

17:56.000 --> 17:59.035
'Yeah, come
and get the stuff, mate.'

18:14.560 --> 18:16.091
Yo, Rob?

18:25.978 --> 18:27.397
Yo!

18:30.440 --> 18:31.878
- Anyone here?
- Cooko!

18:34.480 --> 18:37.120
Cooko!

18:37.120 --> 18:39.200
- I'm up here!
- Ey up, Louie.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.360
Welcome to paradise.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.788
So, what d'you think?

18:45.440 --> 18:47.920
It's a bit of
a shithole, mate, innit?

18:47.920 --> 18:50.360
That it is, my friend,

18:50.360 --> 18:52.600
But just you wait
till tomorrow night,

18:52.600 --> 18:54.680
you won't know
it's the same place.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.280
Pinkie promise.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.698
Come on up!

19:03.120 --> 19:04.768
Sit down, man.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.529
- D'you want a line?
- Nah.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.680
Is Rob around?

19:12.680 --> 19:14.320
Rob's running an errand, mate.

19:14.320 --> 19:18.320
But... I've got your stuff.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.826
No worries.

19:23.950 --> 19:25.941
I'd better get going then, mate.

19:26.020 --> 19:28.320
Hey...

19:28.320 --> 19:30.160
d'you want a beer?

19:30.160 --> 19:34.160
It's cold.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.560
So...

19:37.560 --> 19:39.760
how'd you get on
with Charlie yesterday?

19:39.760 --> 19:43.080
- Yeah, sound. Yeah, nice girl.
- Yeah, she is, she is.

19:43.080 --> 19:46.200
Yeah. So, erm, what?
You looking at houses and shit?

19:46.200 --> 19:48.760
Yeah, we went to look at this house.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.840
It was nice, mate,
you should buy it.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.320
Yeah.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.760
That I might, Cook. That I might.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.760
What, you, erm, just dropped her
off at home after that and...?

20:00.268 --> 20:01.297
Mm-hmm.

20:06.275 --> 20:08.302
Did you notice anything?

20:09.640 --> 20:13.000
- What d'you mean? You know...
- You know what I mean. With Charlie.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.751
Did you notice anything... funny?

20:19.200 --> 20:21.438
Nah, nah. Nothing funny, mate, no.

20:28.529 --> 20:30.817
It's what I like about you, Cook.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.800
Straight down the line, you are.
Right?

20:35.956 --> 20:37.189
Right.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.680
I'm in love with that girl.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.640
You know, proper like,
I love her to pieces.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.720
- Y-y-you get what I'm saying?
- Yeah, Louie.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.160
I can't be doing
with disloyalty, Cook.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.320
That shit, it... it kills my buzz,

20:50.320 --> 20:54.080
it fucking fucks with my circuits,
you know what I mean? Like...

20:54.080 --> 20:56.040
Yeah? Yeah?

20:56.040 --> 20:57.461
Course, mate.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.992
Angry, mate, I get, erm...

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
I get real fucking angry sometimes.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.329
All right, matey.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.880
See you tomorrow.

21:18.880 --> 21:22.880
- Who you, er, who you bringing?
- Emma, my girlfriend.

21:23.160 --> 21:27.080
You're on the guest list, so
don't be... don't be queuing, yeah?

21:27.080 --> 21:29.080
OK, mate, yeah. Nice one.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.720
I'll see you tomorrow,
then. I'm, er...

21:31.720 --> 21:33.680
looking forward to it, mate.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.960
You won't recognise the place, man!

21:35.960 --> 21:38.292
That's a promise!

21:48.960 --> 21:50.560
Ah!

21:50.560 --> 21:53.394
- So, what's going on?
- Well...

21:54.920 --> 21:56.720
You know Charlie?

21:56.720 --> 22:00.720
Yeah, Louie's chick, nice girl.
She's... hot, right?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.680
Yeah. Yeah, well, Louie asked me

22:02.680 --> 22:05.360
to drive her around for
him for the day, like.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.080
- Yeah, and...?
- And...

22:08.080 --> 22:11.680
I got a weird vibe off her.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.320
Like how?

22:13.320 --> 22:15.760
- Like she was into you?
- Well, yeah.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.640
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.400
And then she asked me to drop
her off in the middle of nowhere

22:21.400 --> 22:25.400
and not tell Louie about it.
What do you reckon to that?

22:25.400 --> 22:28.040
You're asking me?
Shit, man, I don't know.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.920
What, so this chick's into you?

22:30.920 --> 22:34.000
I-I don't know that.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
So what?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.240
You're going to tell Louie

22:37.240 --> 22:40.320
that his missus is screwing around
and might be into you?

22:40.320 --> 22:43.400
Nothing happened, right?

22:43.400 --> 22:47.120
Jesus.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.840
Listen, lad, you didn't see shit
and you don't know shit.

22:49.840 --> 22:53.280
Sleeping dogs and all that, OK?

22:53.280 --> 22:55.760
Look, what he don't know...

22:55.760 --> 22:57.189
Thanks.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.815
- I got to go and pick her up.
- In a bit, yeah?

23:12.640 --> 23:15.037
Yo, it's me.

23:15.797 --> 23:19.007
'This is Louie. I can't talk.
So... whatever.'

23:22.990 --> 23:24.350
All right?

23:24.350 --> 23:26.292
There was a line.

23:28.310 --> 23:32.310
Hey, what am I apologising
to you for?

23:32.550 --> 23:36.550
Fuck, I am fricking starving.

23:36.550 --> 23:37.750
You want a chip?

23:37.750 --> 23:38.990
No, ta.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.030
Let's go, bitch.

23:41.030 --> 23:43.572
OK, coming right up.

23:43.580 --> 23:46.670
Let's go, motherfucker!

23:46.670 --> 23:49.190
♪ ...A woman to help me
through the night

23:49.190 --> 23:51.230
♪ I've got a real fine love

23:51.230 --> 23:52.990
♪ Making everything all right

23:52.990 --> 23:55.550
♪ Always makes me feel good

23:55.550 --> 23:59.550
♪ Feel good every day... ♪

24:03.110 --> 24:04.943
What d'you think?

24:08.550 --> 24:09.590
Nice.

24:09.590 --> 24:11.590
"Nice"?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.670
That's all you're giving me, nice?

24:14.670 --> 24:16.270
What's wrong with nice?

24:16.270 --> 24:20.270
This is a 500-quid, bust-a-nut,
fuck-me-hard dress.

24:20.710 --> 24:23.150
It's supposed to be
a lot better than nice.

24:23.150 --> 24:26.310
Let's try again, bitch.

24:26.310 --> 24:27.630
Is this a test?

24:27.630 --> 24:29.830
Yeah, it's a test.

24:29.830 --> 24:33.830
You pay me a compliment in the next
five seconds or I cut your knackers off.

24:34.630 --> 24:35.950
Very nice.

24:37.630 --> 24:40.710
OK, OK, you want my opinion?

24:40.710 --> 24:42.990
Er, yeah.

24:42.990 --> 24:46.830
Right, well, it's a banging dress,
you look hot.

24:46.830 --> 24:50.150
But I don't think you should buy it.

24:50.150 --> 24:51.790
Why not?

24:51.790 --> 24:54.230
Well, I don't know women's clothing
or whatever but,

24:54.230 --> 24:58.230
to me, that's a dress of someone
who's got something to prove.

24:59.010 --> 25:00.850
I'm Louie's girlfriend.

25:00.850 --> 25:03.210
You don't think
I've got something to prove?

25:03.210 --> 25:07.210
Ah, you're already there, trust me.

25:08.810 --> 25:11.210
I'll take it.

25:23.170 --> 25:26.090
You should go easy on that shit.

25:27.890 --> 25:29.970
Yeah, well, if I do enough,
it stops.

25:29.970 --> 25:33.370
What stops?

25:33.370 --> 25:35.221
Everything.

25:39.610 --> 25:42.410
What's happened, Cook?

25:42.410 --> 25:44.450
Oh, yeah.

25:44.450 --> 25:48.330
Funny day, that's all.

25:48.330 --> 25:51.610
Me boss is throwing a party tonight.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.850
Thought you might want to go.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.290
- Go with you?
- Yeah.

25:55.290 --> 25:56.650
Like a date?

25:56.650 --> 26:00.610
If you want.

26:00.610 --> 26:02.309
Yeah, I'd like that.

26:29.930 --> 26:33.930
'Scuse me. Just part the way, lads.

26:35.450 --> 26:37.290
- Are you looking for someone?
- What?

26:37.290 --> 26:40.130
- I said, are you looking for someone?
- Nah. What d'you think?

26:40.130 --> 26:42.330
- Yeah, not bad.
- Cook!

26:42.330 --> 26:44.050
Jason, mate. You made it.

26:44.050 --> 26:46.370
- Looking sharp, mate.
- Easy. You, too.

26:46.370 --> 26:47.810
Hello, who is this lovely lady?

26:47.810 --> 26:49.530
Jason, Emma.

26:49.530 --> 26:52.210
Ooh. Enchante, Emma. Mwah!

26:52.210 --> 26:53.570
Nice to meet you.

26:53.570 --> 26:57.570
Anyway, enjoy.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.530
- Cook?
- Yeah?

26:59.530 --> 27:01.650
He gave us something.

27:01.650 --> 27:03.370
Some kind of bombs.

27:03.370 --> 27:06.690
Oh, fucking Jason, man. Total player!

27:06.690 --> 27:08.810
You know what I mean?

27:08.810 --> 27:12.010
Whoa, whoa!
You don't know what's in that, yeah?

27:12.010 --> 27:14.930
Oh, Jesus, you ain't my fucking mum.

27:14.930 --> 27:16.930
It's my night off,
so I'm gonna have some fun.

27:16.930 --> 27:19.090
Are you coming?

27:19.090 --> 27:23.090
Yeah, fuck it.

27:36.170 --> 27:38.610
What was that for?

27:38.610 --> 27:41.530
Come on, let's dance.

28:15.570 --> 28:19.570
Fucking yes!

28:29.850 --> 28:33.850
Fucking do it, yeah! Yeah!

29:15.570 --> 29:16.970
Ah, shit.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.330
Oh, bollocks.

29:24.370 --> 29:27.170
- You OK?
- Yeah.

29:29.050 --> 29:31.530
What the hell was in that shit?

29:31.530 --> 29:33.570
I'm fine.

29:33.570 --> 29:37.370
I am tripping my tits off
but I'm fine.

29:37.370 --> 29:38.930
Yeah, well...

29:45.730 --> 29:46.810
Who's that girl?

29:46.810 --> 29:48.450
What girl?

29:48.450 --> 29:51.970
You know who I mean. You
kept looking at her.

29:51.970 --> 29:53.290
Oh, don't worry about it.

29:58.450 --> 30:02.170
- Who is she?
- I said don't worry about it.

30:02.170 --> 30:06.170
Argh, shit!

30:06.210 --> 30:09.370
Fucking hell, I've got a splitter.

30:09.370 --> 30:13.370
All right, I'll get you some water.
Wait here.

30:15.250 --> 30:16.970
Agh!

30:16.970 --> 30:18.210
Ooh...

30:18.210 --> 30:19.610
Get off me! Hey!

30:19.610 --> 30:21.930
Fuck you! Argh!

30:21.930 --> 30:23.210
Hello?

30:30.930 --> 30:33.610
Agh!

30:33.610 --> 30:34.730
Everything OK?

30:34.730 --> 30:36.570
God, yes!

30:36.570 --> 30:38.770
Agh!

30:38.770 --> 30:41.770
Oh, fucking hellfire.

30:44.490 --> 30:46.370
Oh, God!

30:46.370 --> 30:48.690
Oh! Oh!

30:48.690 --> 30:51.250
Oh, my God! Jason! Jason,
stop! There's someone...!

30:51.250 --> 30:52.290
Fuck.

30:52.290 --> 30:55.530
Jason, stop!

30:55.530 --> 30:57.650
Shit! Cook!

30:57.650 --> 31:00.610
Yo, Cook, man!

31:00.610 --> 31:01.650
Hey, it's all right.

31:01.650 --> 31:03.010
The fuck are you doing?

31:03.010 --> 31:05.050
Stop it!

31:05.050 --> 31:06.090
Jason, stop it!

31:06.090 --> 31:08.090
Keep your fucking mouth shut, yeah?

31:08.090 --> 31:10.010
Leave him!

31:10.010 --> 31:11.810
Jason, come on, let's go!

31:11.810 --> 31:14.250
You all right, Cook, man?
Your fucking mouth shut?

31:14.250 --> 31:16.610
Better keep your mouth shut, bitch.

31:16.610 --> 31:18.530
Or you're my fucking bitch.

31:18.530 --> 31:20.090
Hear me?

31:20.090 --> 31:24.090
Come on, let's go.

31:25.850 --> 31:29.850
Come on!

31:35.570 --> 31:39.570
Ugh...

31:55.770 --> 31:56.850
Why are you...?

31:58.170 --> 32:02.170
Oh, my God. Cook!

32:09.810 --> 32:11.679
Why are you lying to me?

32:16.610 --> 32:18.170
Tell me what's going on.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.610
It's nothing, babe.

32:19.610 --> 32:20.730
Are you in trouble?

32:20.808 --> 32:22.360
Nowt I can't handle.

32:22.879 --> 32:26.134
Well, you don't look like
you're handling it that well.

32:26.730 --> 32:29.419
What do you want me to say
to you, Em?

32:31.610 --> 32:32.970
Let's get out of here.

32:32.970 --> 32:35.530
Hm?

32:35.530 --> 32:37.330
Let's just go.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.370
You got money, right?

32:40.370 --> 32:43.770
Let's just get in your car
and fucking...

32:43.770 --> 32:44.810
drive!

32:44.810 --> 32:45.930
Where?

32:45.930 --> 32:47.330
Anywhere.

32:47.330 --> 32:50.270
Anywhere. Let's get out of
this shit hole.

32:50.286 --> 32:52.730
Yeah, OK.

32:52.730 --> 32:53.770
- OK?
- Yeah.

32:53.770 --> 32:55.610
Let's do it, right now.

32:56.810 --> 33:00.810
OK!

33:04.850 --> 33:07.290
'I want to see you.'

33:07.290 --> 33:09.770
'Mulligan Street.'

33:09.770 --> 33:11.010
'On the corner.'

33:12.570 --> 33:14.450
Who was that?

33:14.450 --> 33:17.050
It's nothing, babe. Don't worry.

33:17.050 --> 33:19.714
Is it that girl?
The girl from the party?

33:21.210 --> 33:25.210
For once, yeah, be honest.

33:26.330 --> 33:28.325
Be honest.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.290
Forget it.

33:32.290 --> 33:34.290
- Emma...
- No, just fucking...

33:34.290 --> 33:38.290
fucking forget it. I don't know
a fucking thing about you.

33:38.450 --> 33:41.170
Who the hell are you?

33:41.170 --> 33:44.530
Where did you come from?

33:44.530 --> 33:47.050
Tell me!

33:47.050 --> 33:48.650
No.

33:48.650 --> 33:52.650
Well, get the fuck out, then.

34:32.409 --> 34:33.449
Let's go.

34:33.449 --> 34:35.822
- Where to?
- Just drive.

34:44.730 --> 34:47.929
I'm dead sorry about what happened,
Cook.

34:47.929 --> 34:49.250
I didn't want you to get hurt.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.610
Yeah, well, you really know how
to pick them, darlin'.

34:51.610 --> 34:54.810
And I've got the fucking
broken ribs to prove that.

34:54.810 --> 34:57.290
You need to stop messing about.
Louie's no fucking idiot.

34:57.290 --> 34:59.010
He'll find out.

34:59.010 --> 35:01.330
- So just fucking stop.
- I don't have to listen to you.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.770
- I don't know a fucking thing about you.
- I'm serious.

35:03.770 --> 35:06.890
Yeah, well, so am I!

35:06.890 --> 35:09.010
Who are you?

35:09.010 --> 35:10.970
You're some kid who
came out of nowhere

35:10.970 --> 35:12.730
and started telling me
what to do.

35:12.730 --> 35:15.970
Why should I listen to you?

35:15.970 --> 35:19.370
Cos I fucking know about this shit,
all right?

35:19.370 --> 35:21.890
Tell me.

35:21.890 --> 35:25.170
Tell me what happened to you.

35:25.170 --> 35:28.370
What are you running from?

35:28.370 --> 35:32.370
Tell me.

35:34.370 --> 35:38.370
I killed someone.

36:05.610 --> 36:08.570
Do you regret it?

36:08.570 --> 36:12.570
It happened. That's it.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.290
It's all right, Cook.

36:18.290 --> 36:22.290
- It's OK.
- Yeah.

36:22.290 --> 36:24.050
But you can't keep running for ever.

36:24.050 --> 36:25.610
You've got to be who you are.

36:25.610 --> 36:29.170
- Says who?
- Says the universe, Cook.

36:29.170 --> 36:31.370
You're Cook, right?

36:31.370 --> 36:33.610
So be him.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.490
Be Cook.

36:35.490 --> 36:36.930
No.

36:36.930 --> 36:38.930
Cook's a good guy.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.210
Cook's honest.

36:41.210 --> 36:42.250
Cook's decent.

36:42.250 --> 36:44.450
Stop it! Fuck!
Just... fucking stop it!

36:44.450 --> 36:47.330
Cook's honourable.

36:47.330 --> 36:51.330
Cook's sexy.

36:53.610 --> 36:57.610
Be sexy for me, Cook.

36:59.810 --> 37:03.810
Come on.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.330
For me.

37:06.330 --> 37:10.330
Be Cook... for me.

38:14.450 --> 38:16.970
Oh, fuckin' yeah, go on.

38:16.970 --> 38:18.250
Yeah.

38:22.250 --> 38:23.450
Oh... leave it!

38:25.610 --> 38:26.650
Leave it.

38:36.250 --> 38:38.290
Ah, yeah. Go on, then.

38:38.290 --> 38:42.290
Oh, God, leave it!

38:42.410 --> 38:46.090
Fuck!

38:46.090 --> 38:47.370
Hey, Cooko!

38:47.370 --> 38:49.450
I need a hand.

38:49.450 --> 38:50.610
Oi.

38:50.610 --> 38:52.970
Yeah? Yeah, go on, Louie.
Wha... what's up?

38:52.970 --> 38:56.690
I need you to pick up Charlie
and come round here.

38:56.690 --> 38:58.970
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure. Where's here?

38:58.970 --> 39:00.170
The new house, mate!

39:00.170 --> 39:03.850
I bought that shit. Come on over,
we're having a proper mitzvah.

39:03.850 --> 39:06.650
OK. OK, yeah. Yeah, I'll... I'll get
Charlie, I'll be right over.

39:06.650 --> 39:09.530
See you, bruva.

39:09.530 --> 39:12.530
Shit.

39:12.530 --> 39:15.353
- We gotta go.
- OK.

39:38.050 --> 39:39.964
Cooko!

39:40.551 --> 39:41.591
Charlotte!

39:41.850 --> 39:43.410
- Sweetie.
- All right, mate?

39:43.410 --> 39:45.290
What happened to your face, man?

39:45.290 --> 39:48.210
Oh, it's nothing, I just got beat
down, mate. I'm sound.

39:48.210 --> 39:52.210
Well, grab a beer, take it easy.
Sit down.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.890
You're all right, mate.
Here y'are.

39:55.890 --> 39:56.970
So...

39:56.970 --> 39:59.210
Thank you.

39:59.210 --> 40:03.210
What do you think
of our new home? Mm.

40:03.410 --> 40:07.410
It is pretty fucking P-I-M-P, boss.

40:07.770 --> 40:10.330
That it is.

40:10.330 --> 40:14.929
But... it's more than that, yeah?
It's... it's a house to grow old in.

40:15.077 --> 40:20.099
It's a... it's a house
to have... kids in? Right, baby?

40:20.148 --> 40:22.090
- Yeah.
- You like?

40:22.090 --> 40:25.392
Yeah, Lou, I told you, I love it.

40:25.549 --> 40:28.330
What else do you love?

40:28.330 --> 40:31.930
I love you, Louie.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.050
Yeah?

40:35.050 --> 40:38.730
Then why are you fucking
one of my mates, then?

40:38.730 --> 40:39.770
What?

40:39.770 --> 40:41.770
I know what's going on.

40:41.770 --> 40:45.010
- Mm? Mm-hmm.
- I don't have to take this shit.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.330
Call me when you want to apologise,
yeah, Louie?

40:47.330 --> 40:51.250
Charlotte...

40:51.250 --> 40:53.200
sit the fuck down.

41:02.690 --> 41:05.170
Louie... Shut the fuck up, Cook.

41:05.170 --> 41:06.650
Now, everyone chill.

41:06.650 --> 41:08.090
Chill.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.810
Nothing is fucked
that can't be fixed,

41:10.810 --> 41:12.170
at least that's what I think.

41:12.170 --> 41:16.244
We can all go on
the same way... it always was.

41:16.645 --> 41:18.026
Right?

41:18.930 --> 41:22.930
Rob?

41:22.970 --> 41:24.730
Yeah. Right, mate.

41:24.730 --> 41:28.250
I'm just gonna, um... yeah,
I'm just gonna...

41:28.250 --> 41:30.770
subtract one thing.

41:30.770 --> 41:33.490
Streamline my operation, like.

41:33.490 --> 41:35.610
Mm.

41:35.610 --> 41:39.610
Rob?

41:45.970 --> 41:49.690
Mate.

41:49.690 --> 41:51.290
Get up.

41:51.290 --> 41:53.490
What the fuck is this, man?

41:53.490 --> 41:55.650
Fuckin'... What the fuck?!

41:55.650 --> 41:57.930
- Get the fuck off me!
- You think I wouldn't find out?

41:57.930 --> 42:00.052
- Ah, fuckin' hell!
- I'm fucking Louie!

42:00.068 --> 42:00.552
Get the fuck off me!

42:00.560 --> 42:02.570
You don't get that shit past me,
motherfucker.

42:02.570 --> 42:05.130
I haven't done fuck all!
Fuck you!

42:05.130 --> 42:06.290
No! No, fuck off!

42:06.290 --> 42:08.250
Ah! Ah!

42:08.250 --> 42:09.570
Get the fuck off me!

42:22.850 --> 42:24.650
You fucked my girl, Jason.

42:24.650 --> 42:28.650
I can't be letting you get
away with that.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.160
He's dying, Louie.

42:53.160 --> 42:56.760
Yeah. I know. It's fucked up, innit?

42:56.760 --> 42:58.480
Hm?

42:58.480 --> 43:02.040
What have you got to say
for yourself?

43:02.040 --> 43:06.040
Didn't think so.

43:15.160 --> 43:19.160
BOTTLE TOP POPS
Done, mate.

43:22.380 --> 43:25.020
Fuck.

43:25.020 --> 43:28.420
Oh, dear.

43:28.420 --> 43:29.660
Oh, fuck.

43:29.660 --> 43:31.260
Whoo!

43:31.260 --> 43:32.660
Shit.

43:32.660 --> 43:35.500
Unh!

43:35.500 --> 43:37.860
Sorry, mate.

43:37.860 --> 43:41.860
Sorry.

43:44.540 --> 43:48.020
Fuck.

43:48.020 --> 43:52.020
Come on.

43:52.500 --> 43:56.500
Clean up this mess.

44:11.380 --> 44:15.366
- We've gotta go. What?
- Pack your shit.

44:15.540 --> 44:17.100
Come on! We've gotta go, man.

44:17.100 --> 44:21.100
Cook... what's going on?

44:21.940 --> 44:24.540
Cook! What's going on? Cook?

44:24.540 --> 44:26.220
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

44:26.220 --> 44:29.100
You wanted me to be honest with you.
I'm being honest with you now.

44:29.100 --> 44:31.340
We've got to get the fuck out of
here. Just like we said,

44:31.340 --> 44:34.311
fuck off out of town.

44:35.980 --> 44:38.500
You tell me everything.
Yeah, I will, I promise.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.420
We just gotta get moving, OK?

44:40.420 --> 44:44.420
- OK.
- Come on.

45:10.260 --> 45:13.460
- Yeah?
- 'Cook, you got to help me.'

45:13.460 --> 45:15.780
- 'I'm so scared, please...'
- Who is it?

45:15.780 --> 45:18.140
- 'Please come, Cook. Come to me, please.'
- Where are you?

45:18.140 --> 45:19.500
'I'm at the bus station.'

45:19.500 --> 45:22.100
'I don't know what to do.'

45:22.100 --> 45:23.260
'Cook?'

45:23.260 --> 45:24.780
OK.

45:24.780 --> 45:28.151
OK...

45:32.860 --> 45:34.220
What you doing?

45:34.220 --> 45:37.700
Cook?

45:37.700 --> 45:40.180
Cook, where you going?

45:40.180 --> 45:43.300
Cook?

45:43.300 --> 45:44.940
Cook, don't go back.

45:44.940 --> 45:45.980
Cook!

45:45.980 --> 45:49.980
Don't go back!

45:56.870 --> 45:59.350
- Is it safe here?
- I think so.

45:59.350 --> 46:02.070
- Emma? What on earth are you doing here?
- Hi, Mum.

46:02.070 --> 46:03.790
Did you fuck him?

46:03.790 --> 46:05.670
Fight for me, don't just... lie down.

46:05.670 --> 46:07.710
Where's the gun?

46:07.710 --> 46:09.670
Cook?

46:09.670 --> 46:12.670
You broke my heart, babe.
Snap, fuckin' snap.

46:12.670 --> 46:15.510
How long do we have to go on?

46:15.510 --> 46:18.255
Till it's finished.
