Got him.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.279
Are we done?

01:04.680 --> 01:07.279
Bar what I suspect
will be a lengthy debriefing.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.879
- But tomorrow, yeah?
- Tomorrow.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.519
You all right?

01:11.600 --> 01:13.359
I think he's pushed some bone
into me brain.

01:13.680 --> 01:14.999
Excellent.

Victim's Emily Hammond.
Edits technical manuals.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.359
Divorced, no kids.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.919
Comes home around 11:00.
No sign of forced entry,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.999
so it looks like she might have
known her killer, let him in.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.239
- Comes home from where?
- Speed dating.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.199
What, she's brought him home and...

06:21.280 --> 06:22.919
- It doesn't sound right, does it?
- No.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.199
Women don't go speed dating for sex,
they go for a relationship,

06:26.280 --> 06:27.319
but check 'em all out.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.839
- Um, ex-husband?
- Lives in Bristol.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.439
- Run it?
- Being done as we speak.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.359
There's nothing to suggest
she was into S&M.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.119
No fetish gear in the wardrobe,
nothing on her browsing history.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.279
No, no.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.039
Our boy has brought this stuff with him.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.639
- You reckon?
- Hmm.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.239
Look, it's a very specific look.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.479
The wig, the make-up.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.679
There's a bit of a Siouxsie-and-the-
Banshees thing going on here.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.599
- Who and the what?
- '80s.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.559
Post-punk.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.479
- Oh, uh, goths.
- Post-punk.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.559
Oh, it's definitely not her wig.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.399
Dirty old thing.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.839
She's not wearing shoes.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.519
You can see the, uh, strap marks.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.799
She was wearing the shoes
when she was strangled.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.079
So where are the shoes?

07:21.960 --> 07:23.479
I've seen something like this before.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.999
- Yeah, where?
- Photograph. Something.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.399
So he's, what?
Re-enacting an old murder?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.679
Maybe he's a fan.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.279
Paying homage.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.039
Back door was point of exit,
front door was deadbolted.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.119
All right, well...

07:42.200 --> 07:43.479
Check that back door again.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.239
Chances are it's probably the way
he let himself in.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.399
DCI Luther.

07:48.640 --> 07:49.999
Do you have a moment?

07:52.600 --> 07:53.759
How was it?

07:54.320 --> 07:55.759
Fetish killing.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.159
Whatever he's doing, looks like
he's been planning it for a long time.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.999
So now that he's started...

08:03.280 --> 08:05.279
Be hard for him to stop,
even if he wanted to.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.319
I, uh...

08:10.440 --> 08:12.799
I've been ordered to move you
to another case.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.359
What other case?

08:15.040 --> 08:16.639
Jared Cass.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.919
Sickness beneficiary.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.479
Cyber-activist, whatever that might be.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.599
Found dead in his flat this morning.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.199
This was filmed on Cass's smartphone.

08:27.280 --> 08:30.079
- I didn't do anything...
- Distributed to his contacts list.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.039
I'm... I'm sorry.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.438
This was how it ended.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.958
What a day. Okay, but why us?

08:38.039 --> 08:39.119
Not us.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.078
- You.
- Me?

08:43.520 --> 08:44.879
Personally? Why?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.799
- Murder's murder, John.
- Oh, come on, boss. Seriously.

08:47.880 --> 08:51.919
This is a revenge killing.
Meat and potatoes.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.319
The man who killed Emily Hammond
is organised but not sane.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.199
- He's gonna kill again and very soon.
- It's out of my hands.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.039
You know this smells funny, right?

09:04.120 --> 09:05.559
Can you handle both?

09:07.480 --> 09:08.799
I can handle both.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.479
Don't make me regret it.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.639
What's that?

09:15.720 --> 09:17.639
I've got another thing.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.399
You're kidding. What other thing?

09:19.480 --> 09:21.319
Animal cruelty.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.039
Listen, I need you to brief Benny.

09:23.120 --> 09:27.159
Tell him to go over cold cases,
anything pertaining to Emily's death.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.919
I'm talking strangulation,
burglary, shoe theft...

09:30.000 --> 09:32.719
- Masks and wigs.
- Yeah, don't rule out anything.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.359
You know what? The mask, the wigs,

09:35.440 --> 09:36.959
I think it's part of something else,
you know,

09:37.040 --> 09:38.519
he was trying to recreate something.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.479
Staging something,
it's not part of the fetish.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.119
- Right, how far back are we looking?
- 1979 or something. Oi...

09:45.000 --> 09:47.959
Meet me at the Jared Cass crime scene
on Hawksmoor Estate.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.919
Hello?

09:55.520 --> 09:57.359
Why? What's it about?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.119
Do I have any choice?

10:04.840 --> 10:05.919
I'll be there.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.279
Detective Sergeant Ripley.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.119
Detective Chief Inspector Gray.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.599
Just "ma'am" will do.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.439
How's life in the Judas division, ma'am?

10:47.360 --> 10:48.799
Rooting out dirty coppers?

10:49.760 --> 10:50.919
Satisfying.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.799
The way you stitched me up to
save your boss, I owe you a favour.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.479
You've given me a vocation.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.399
So what am I doing here?
You going to waterboard me?

11:02.800 --> 11:04.959
Get in.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.079
DS Ripley.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.559
George Stark.

12:07.640 --> 12:08.999
Of what division?

12:11.240 --> 12:12.439
Retired.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.039
They unretired me.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.359
For a special project.

12:19.640 --> 12:20.719
Come with me.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.759
Oh, come on,
you've got to be kidding me.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.199
Have a seat.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.039
Zoe Luther. Dead.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.239
Ian Reed. Dead.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.919
Henry Madsen. Dead.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.799
Toby Kent. Dead.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.799
Alice Morgan.
Missing, presumed, well...

12:57.800 --> 12:58.879
Who knows?

12:59.520 --> 13:01.079
Common denominator?

13:05.400 --> 13:06.479
So...

13:09.160 --> 13:10.639
There was a park ranger.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.199
In America, that is.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.359
He was struck seven times by lightning.
Seven times.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.439
Actually made The Guinness
Book of Records

13:21.080 --> 13:23.239
for being the unluckiest guy
in the world.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.519
Or maybe the luckiest guy in the world,
depends on how you look at it.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.439
And...

13:29.480 --> 13:32.519
Do you really think he's innocent,
your boss,

13:33.160 --> 13:34.999
of this murder?

13:35.640 --> 13:37.479
Of this?

13:37.560 --> 13:38.919
Of this one?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.719
Think he's just, uh,
some kind of lightning rod?

13:41.800 --> 13:45.839
Somebody who just gets struck again
and again and again and again?

13:54.400 --> 13:58.359
Carpet underlay from one of the holes
that your boss used to live in.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.279
It's got this man's blood on it.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.599
Toby Kent.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.079
Never heard of him.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.519
Our witness says that Luther killed him.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.719
Put a knife
through the back of his skull.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.119
That place was disgusting,
you could find anything on that carpet.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.519
Are you a homosexual?

14:23.080 --> 14:24.679
Like that's any of your business.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.319
It is my business
if your romantic yearnings

14:28.400 --> 14:31.759
are clouding your judgment
as a police officer.

14:32.520 --> 14:33.559
If you're trying to touch a nerve,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.399
then you're touching me
in the wrong place.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.479
Then you're either a donkey
or you're an accomplice.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.039
And I don't think you're a donkey.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.199
I won't answer any more questions
without my union rep.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.279
Well, then your career ends here.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.359
Because you'll be charged
as an accessory after the fact.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.679
What fact?

15:00.120 --> 15:02.279
If you had any proof of wrongdoings,
then you'd show it.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.599
- What, I'd show you my hand?
- Yeah.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.719
Yeah. Right.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.159
Fine.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.319
You think I don't know a liar
when I see one, son?! Huh?!

15:13.400 --> 15:14.639
You're lying to me!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.159
Now, talk to me!

15:16.720 --> 15:17.959
Tell me!

15:29.840 --> 15:31.799
It's not very nice, is it?

15:32.280 --> 15:35.199
Somebody who's supposed
to be representing the law

15:35.560 --> 15:40.039
and yet operates
in his own sense of justice.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.759
Just read it.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.919
- Benny, what you got?
- Do you remember the Shoreditch Creeper?

15:51.160 --> 15:53.759
Er, yeah, dim, distant memory.
Go on.

15:53.840 --> 15:58.119
Okay, '78 to '81, he assaults eight
women in an escalating pattern.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.479
Breaks in, ties them up,
masturbates while sucking their toes.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.839
Then steals their shoes.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.959
Graduates to killing three times.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.239
Theresa Johnson in '81
and Vivian Leavie,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.239
plus Sheryl Moody in '82.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.719
Then he just stops, drops off the grid.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.319
Not of his own accord, he doesn't.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.919
I mean,
not if he's escalating like that.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.479
- How old is he?
- Mid-30s when the offending began.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.439
Well, that puts him in his 70s now?

16:24.200 --> 16:25.279
Doesn't sound right, does it?

16:25.480 --> 16:26.519
Benny, do me a favour.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.519
Sign off on the cold cases
and have them sent to me.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.959
Right, on the way.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.159
Oh.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.839
Sir?

16:33.320 --> 16:35.879
Come on. Come on.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.439
You all right?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.159
I think so. Uh, yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:50.999
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm sorry.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.159
You know what? You need to sit down,
just for a second.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.599
Just need to sit down there.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.479
- Yeah.
- You all right, yeah?

16:57.560 --> 16:59.519
Oh, your poor car.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.079
No, don't worry about that.
It always looks like that.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.598
- Is it like a classic?
- Yeah. Probably.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.759
Do you mind if I just take a look?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.799
Er, just look left. Right.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.519
Up, down.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.839
Any dizziness?
Did you bang your head, did you?

17:15.920 --> 17:18.358
No. No, what, are you a doctor?

17:18.440 --> 17:19.638
No, I'm a copper.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.598
- DCI Luther.
- Luther?

17:22.880 --> 17:23.959
It's a good name.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.519
- Well, can't take the credit for it.
- It's an unusual name.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.239
Not in my house.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.199
Look, don't worry about any of this.
Um, it really was my fault.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.999
You know, um,
I'm not totally sure it was.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.959
- I...
- No, honestly. It was my fault.

17:38.040 --> 17:41.559
So I'm gonna get your information
for the insurance 'cause I've got to...

17:41.680 --> 17:42.839
- Be somewhere, of course.
- Yeah.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.559
You're, like, rushing
to the scene of the crime.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.439
- I am, actually.
- Right.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.439
Sorry, um...

17:48.960 --> 17:49.959
- I haven't got my, um...
- It's all right.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.759
I'll just write my... My name's John.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.519
All right?

17:56.880 --> 17:58.639
So, I'll call you.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.839
- Now, go. I'm fine.
- All right.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.879
If you had any real evidence,
you'd be talking to John, not me.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.719
If you really believe he's so spotless,
then prevent an injustice.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.359
Help him. Prove it.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.199
And how do you suggest I do that?

18:24.760 --> 18:27.159
DCI Luther will be taking on a case

18:27.600 --> 18:30.919
of a waste of semen called Jared Cass.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.919
Squalid little business.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.639
Small cheese for big bad John.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.719
It was you?

18:38.640 --> 18:40.199
You had him assigned
to the Jared Cass murder?

18:40.680 --> 18:44.359
I want to know exactly
how he handles that investigation.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.079
And I mean every move by move,

18:48.400 --> 18:50.039
breath by breath.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.639
If he breaks the law,
I want his head on a stick.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.799
He doesn't know it,
but his good fortune ran out

19:00.880 --> 19:03.519
the day that I heard his name.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.559
Stand clear of the doors.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.519
Sir.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.199
All yours.

20:05.640 --> 20:06.999
You'll read anything, you.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.559
Wotcher.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.839
- What's it say?
- Gang tags, mainly.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.079
Territorial pissing.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.639
The killer signed the body,
that's handy.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.679
Huh.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.439
Post-mortem, apparently.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.999
They've walked in here,

20:24.440 --> 20:25.799
nicked the stuff,

20:25.880 --> 20:29.079
tagged the walls, tagged him,
spat on him, pissed on him.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.359
Still, I suppose
it's what he would've wanted.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.399
You know, we're under the cosh
to clear this up quickly.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.959
Yeah, but we're gonna do it right,
though, yeah?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.319
What is wrong with everyone today?

20:43.400 --> 20:44.599
Of course we're gonna do it right,

20:44.680 --> 20:46.279
we're just gonna do it quickly,
that's all.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.319
- So, where do we start?
- Oh...

20:51.240 --> 20:52.639
Enemies.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.679
Apparently, he had quite a few.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.159
Guess he liked to sit in a room
and slag people off on the internet.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.559
Guy was a troll.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.959
See, here's what I don't understand.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.559
Is why did they loot the place?

21:06.280 --> 21:07.719
Because it's here?

21:07.800 --> 21:11.639
Yeah, but you loot somewhere when
it's got stuff worth looting, don't you?

21:12.840 --> 21:15.559
Iraqi National Museum, JD Sports.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.039
Yeah, but not Jared Cass.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.759
He was on sickness benefit,
never left the place.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.879
So what did he have
that was so expensive?

21:26.520 --> 21:28.199
Where'd you get the money, Jared?

22:54.760 --> 22:56.359
Okay, John, listen.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.599
The Shoreditch Creeper case
was a massive investigation.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.039
It's not so much police work
as archaeology.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.559
Who was senior?

23:03.640 --> 23:05.319
Er, DCI Ronnie Holland.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.159
Good copper, Ronnie.
Long since had his clock.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.599
Let's find DCI Holland,
see what he remembers.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.759
In a case like this, he must have known
who he liked for it,

23:13.840 --> 23:14.959
even if he couldn't prove it.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.479
So let's find out who, yeah?

23:17.640 --> 23:19.639
Yep. I'm going straight there now.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.959
There's a Sean Beamish at 67

23:24.040 --> 23:26.799
and that gentleman thinks
he might go by the name of "Beanie".

23:34.280 --> 23:35.559
Sean Beamish?

23:36.320 --> 23:39.319
Sean "Beanie" Beamish?
It's the police, open up.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.399
- What?
- Jared Cass.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.279
- What about him?
- Well, he's dead, isn't he?

23:47.400 --> 23:49.919
What, still? Lazy sod, innit?

23:51.960 --> 23:54.919
Well, it took us all of two minutes
to find out he borrowed money from you,

23:55.400 --> 23:57.199
to buy all that stuff
he really couldn't afford.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.399
60-inch LCD, Blu-ray library, laptop.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.999
I mean, what's a loan shark
supposed to do?

24:02.120 --> 24:04.279
Can't pay his bills,
so you threatened him

24:04.520 --> 24:06.479
and you threatened him again
and then...

24:07.200 --> 24:09.239
Oops, he's dead.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.599
Funny, that.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.599
- Oi!
- Oi!

24:13.880 --> 24:14.919
Come here!

24:15.360 --> 24:16.879
Don't...

24:17.760 --> 24:19.519
Help!

24:19.760 --> 24:20.959
Boss. Boss!

24:21.800 --> 24:23.439
Shush. You're making me very jumpy.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.119
Boss, stop!

24:26.280 --> 24:29.319
Erin, whatever's happening,
I want eyes on it. Now.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.439
On my way.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.119
I got a very nasty man

24:33.200 --> 24:35.279
doing very nasty things to people.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.919
And I want to get off this grubby case
as fast as I can.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.919
Boss! Boss!

24:41.000 --> 24:43.119
- Can you see him?
- You wanna help me or what?

24:43.600 --> 24:45.159
Help!  Yeah!

24:46.520 --> 24:47.599
Do you see him?

24:49.920 --> 24:51.279
Oh, dear.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.639
Nothing.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.199
How many convictions have you had?

25:01.280 --> 25:03.039
I don't... I don't know. A few.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.839
- Yeah?
- Bit of this, bit of that.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.559
Ever been done on a murder charge?

25:06.800 --> 25:07.959
- No.
- No? Why not?

25:08.360 --> 25:09.799
Because I never killed no one.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.879
Except for Jared Cass.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.279
Except no, I didn't do him.
So you've got no evidence.

25:14.840 --> 25:15.919
Evidence?

25:16.040 --> 25:18.239
Come on, a man of your experience,
you're talking about evidence?

25:19.160 --> 25:20.679
This is how it actually works.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.039
Murder investigation, three pillars.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.439
Means, motive and opportunity.
I've got means and motive down.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.599
Yeah, but you haven't got the other one.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.719
Oh, opportunity?
Yeah, well, that's seasoning.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.599
And when it comes to seasoning,
I'm like Jamie Oliver,

25:33.680 --> 25:36.119
I just rummage around the cupboard,
just see what I can find.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.719
Are you saying you'd fit me up?

25:38.880 --> 25:41.479
Come on, you dirty bastard, say it.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.359
What is this? Nazi Russia?

25:46.760 --> 25:48.559
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's Nazi Russia.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.319
Stand up!

25:53.240 --> 25:55.039
You put yourself at the crime scene,
didn't you?

25:55.120 --> 25:56.999
You made yourself
prime suspect number one,

25:57.080 --> 25:58.839
so I don't need to fit you up, do I?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.519
- Bollocks.
- I heard he was dead, all right?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.119
Everyone did.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.319
So I... I went to get back
what he owed me, while I had the chance.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.799
He was dead when I got there.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.479
He was a funny colour and everything,
I totally swear.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.999
Completely and totally.
On my sack, blood.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.159
I'm not your blood.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.359
So who did it, then?

26:18.440 --> 26:20.439
Anyone, really. Throw a brick.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.599
Is that supposed to help me?
'Cause it really don't help me.

26:26.200 --> 26:30.079
Look, the bloke never went out.
All he did was sit in that flat.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.639
He... He slagged off
loads of people online.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.559
Any one of them would have killed him.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.879
- We want his laptop and his phone.
- Just give me the laptop.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.959
How it got there, I don't really care.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.039
In my lockup, downstairs.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.639
You shouldn't joke around like that,
you know.

26:46.720 --> 26:47.919
Like what?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.399
About fitting people up. One day
the wrong people could be listening.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.639
- Who said I was joking?
- Seriously, you shouldn't joke.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.199
What are you, my dad?

26:58.120 --> 27:00.679
- Right, I'll get it to the lab.
- How long's that gonna take?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.199
Dunno, a week?

27:03.360 --> 27:05.519
- Can't you fast-track it?
- Yeah, that is fast-track.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.119
Well, you do it, then.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.119
- Um...
- Come on,

27:09.200 --> 27:10.719
do you want this cleared up
quickly or not?

27:11.480 --> 27:12.559
All right.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.919
I'm going as fast as I can.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.959
- Did I say anything?
- You were thinking it.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.319
Well, I...

28:21.680 --> 28:23.639
- Yeah?
- I've been looking up your name.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.359
Do you know what it means?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.319
- Tired and grumpy?
- No.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.199
Um, well, it's derived from the German.

28:31.720 --> 28:35.679
Liut meaning "people"
and herimeaning "army", so...

28:36.920 --> 28:38.319
It means "people's army".

28:39.560 --> 28:41.999
Oh, okay.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.679
I felt bad about earlier.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.319
So you call me to tell me
what my name means?

28:52.280 --> 28:53.519
Thought you might like to know.

28:54.840 --> 28:55.839
Okay.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.999
So...

28:59.320 --> 29:00.679
It was my fault.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.919
I was retuning the radio.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.199
And I let you think it was your fault.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.119
And I feel bad.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.079
There.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.919
- Said it.
- No, listen, honestly,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.639
don't worry about it. Um...

29:14.720 --> 29:17.879
The AA have got my number on speed dial.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.199
So, what, you're happy
to just take the blame?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.159
"Happy" is a strong word.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.839
Seriously?

29:26.920 --> 29:29.359
No, honestly,
don't worry about it. Really.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.479
Well, can I... Can I buy you
a drink or something, make it up to you?

29:33.560 --> 29:36.559
- Yeah, sure. Why not?
- Okay.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.759
When?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.919
Listen, I've got to go.
Can I call you later?

29:42.400 --> 29:43.519
Okay.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.279
Motive, maybe?

30:00.840 --> 30:02.279
- Ken Barnaby?
- Yes.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.399
DCI John Luther, DS Ripley.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.039
- Can we come in?
- Yes.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.399
Thank you.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.519
- It's just downstairs.
- Yep.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.719
Her name was Cathy.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.159
She was in the sixth form.

30:24.120 --> 30:28.159
Four A-levels.
She wanted to go to Oxford.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.959
She was a very, very clever girl.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.199
Brilliant, really.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.039
Very beautiful, very kind.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.679
She'd been managing the epilepsy
since she was seven.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.599
And she... she never let it
frighten her, never let it stop her.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.799
She was amazing. She was my little girl.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.159
And then... Well...

31:00.480 --> 31:01.919
I'm very sorry.

31:04.720 --> 31:08.679
Um, I hate to keep dragging this up

31:08.760 --> 31:10.679
but, um...

31:14.200 --> 31:15.879
Her memorial site.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.639
It was defaced.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.359
It started with someone
impersonating her online.

31:29.400 --> 31:33.359
Sending messages,
"Help me, Daddy. It's so hot in Hell."

31:34.760 --> 31:37.839
Pictures of corpses

31:39.440 --> 31:41.479
with her...
her name written on them.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.879
Messages on Father's Day.

31:44.520 --> 31:49.079
Photos of a graveyard...
"Wish you were here."

31:50.600 --> 31:52.039
And then...

31:54.280 --> 31:56.519
he started sending pictures.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.319
Cathy's face,

32:02.520 --> 32:05.319
photoshopped onto obscene images.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.879
My little girl.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.159
Images where men were...

32:19.240 --> 32:20.639
And did you know who was doing it?

32:21.600 --> 32:24.639
No. No, we'd... we'd complain.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.759
Er, the site would get taken down,
but another would spring up.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.359
It just... It didn't stop.

32:31.440 --> 32:36.639
Er... The taunts, the emails,
the pictures... Horrible things.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.679
Who could do it to us?

32:41.680 --> 32:43.719
I hadn't been very well and...

32:43.800 --> 32:47.319
Well, since Cathy died,
it was very tough.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.159
It was very hard for Ken and me.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.479
Could I offer you a glass of water?

33:05.720 --> 33:07.799
- No, thank you. We're fine.
- Yes.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.879
We'd love some water, Ken, thank you.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.599
I'm sorry to be so...

34:40.679 --> 34:42.359
Don't worry, got a job to do.

34:44.679 --> 34:45.918
I wonder...

34:47.960 --> 34:51.918
Could I ask you where Ken was
three nights ago?

34:56.400 --> 34:58.239
You okay, boss?

34:58.760 --> 35:00.079
No.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.719
- You okay?
- Not really, that was horrible.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.679
You like him for it? Barnaby?

35:09.720 --> 35:10.839
No.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.159
- Boss.
- Well, his wife alibied him.

35:15.040 --> 35:19.039
What, he was home all night and
here's some texts to prove it? Come on.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.959
Got any evidence?

35:21.040 --> 35:22.839
No, but we've got motive.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.879
I don't know what you want me to say.

35:28.520 --> 35:31.959
What, look, I've got a fetish killer
on the loose, all right?

35:32.160 --> 35:34.519
This is important
but it's not my priority.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.839
Ronnie? Ronnie Holland?

35:56.680 --> 35:58.839
- Think we'd better take the door down.
- Sir.

36:20.600 --> 36:21.879
I'll follow you in.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.519
All right.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.479
What the hell are you doing?
Do you think he's stupid?

36:38.560 --> 36:40.679
No, but I think he's already noticed
something's not right.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.879
You're not a very good liar, Justin.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.679
And that makes you think coming here
was a good idea?

36:49.360 --> 36:50.679
No, but this does.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.159
If he thinks you're acting weird
and sneaking around

37:03.240 --> 37:06.319
because we're seeing each other,
he'll be in his element.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.959
Thinking he's got one over on you.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.039
You do know Ken Barnaby
killed Jared Cass?

37:15.480 --> 37:17.599
- I know, yeah.
- And so does Luther.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.399
But he's gonna let Barnaby walk.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.839
His mind's on this other thing.
Emily Hammond.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.279
- That's all it is.
- So push him.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.319
Force him to make a decision.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.999
If he comes down the right side,
orders Ken Barnaby arrested,

37:28.080 --> 37:29.879
you've proved your point.
And if he doesn't...

37:30.520 --> 37:33.359
Well, I don't know
what's going to open your eyes.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.719
You don't have to
enjoy this so much, Erin.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.199
You're better than this.

37:38.760 --> 37:42.359
No, what I am is better than him.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.239
And so are you.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.279
Hmm.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.799
The clothes and the wig
date to the early '80s,

38:06.880 --> 38:08.759
but whoever's face is on that mask,

38:08.840 --> 38:10.359
she's not in the cold case files.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.199
It all fits the MO,
but she's just not in there.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.319
Okay, so if she's not a known victim,

38:15.400 --> 38:17.079
then why is the killer recreating?

38:18.640 --> 38:20.639
What am I not seeing?

38:22.960 --> 38:25.759
Boss, I've had an idea
about the other thing, Jared Cass.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.159
Mind if I shoot off and look into it?

38:28.720 --> 38:29.999
Yeah, you go.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.479
How'd it go with Ronnie Holland?

38:41.160 --> 38:42.839
Found him dead in his hallway.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.999
He'd been there for months.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.839
The neighbours thought the stink came
from the communal bins.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.599
Cause of death?

38:51.680 --> 38:55.039
Blunt force trauma to the skull.
No sign of struggle.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.839
John, where's all this going?

38:58.240 --> 39:01.559
I don't know.
It's all mixed up, past, present...

39:03.120 --> 39:04.519
Can't get my head around it.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.559
Okay, back to Emily Hammond.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.319
- Emily, because...
- Emily, because

39:12.400 --> 39:17.359
Emily has some particular quality
which reminds the killer...

39:17.440 --> 39:18.999
Of this woman.

39:19.240 --> 39:23.479
Right. But what connects her
to a series of murders

39:24.240 --> 39:26.479
that happened 30 years ago?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.279
What ties them together?

39:31.360 --> 39:32.999
What do they have in common?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.999
Everything. They've got
everything in common.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.719
We've been looking at this
the wrong way round.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.919
Emily was the fantasy, specifically her.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.879
- It's always been about her.
- Yeah, then why cover her face?

39:49.040 --> 39:50.799
Why the mask and the clothes?

39:52.480 --> 39:53.959
That is not another woman,

39:54.840 --> 39:56.399
'cause that's Emily.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.719
He's making her look the way she used to

39:58.800 --> 40:00.079
back in 1982.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.039
These bins have definitely
been emptied and searched?

41:02.440 --> 41:03.439
Yes, guv.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.639
How about upstairs
where the garbage chute is?

41:05.720 --> 41:07.279
There's loads of piles of bin bags.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.479
They weren't there this morning.

41:09.720 --> 41:10.799
Give me the torch.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.239
It's blocked.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.639
I want this chute emptied and searched.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.679
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.999
That was really, really lovely.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.759
Did you hear a...

41:39.560 --> 41:40.719
Okay.

41:44.320 --> 41:45.959
Smokie!

42:53.200 --> 42:54.519
Benny was right.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.279
Emily is absolutely not
in the cold case file.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.679
However, I know
how Ronnie's mind worked.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.919
He would have kept a subset
of "possibly related" files.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.079
Is she in there?

43:06.520 --> 43:07.919
1982.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.159
Emily Hammond's 14 years of age,

43:10.240 --> 43:13.679
she's living with her mother
at 148 Crosswood Street, Shoreditch.

43:13.760 --> 43:14.799
Oh.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.399
On the evening of March the 12th,
Emily's alone at home, asleep,

43:19.080 --> 43:20.919
when the lodger comes home
from a CND rally.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.839
The lodger discovers
a man in Emily's room.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.959
However, the lodger isn't alone,
she's got six other people with her,

43:27.040 --> 43:28.879
who are all fired up from this rally.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.999
So the men get stuck into the intruder,

43:31.080 --> 43:33.039
who makes a break for it and gets away.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.119
- That's him.
- Ronnie seemed to think so,

43:35.200 --> 43:36.999
but his bosses didn't agree.

43:37.080 --> 43:38.519
MO was different.

43:38.600 --> 43:41.799
The other victims were older,
in their 20s, lived alone.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.119
How many people lived at that address?

43:43.200 --> 43:46.079
Oh, Emily and her mother.
A Claire Hammond, since died.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.999
Oh, and the lodger, a Dani Shahi.

43:49.080 --> 43:50.679
Dani Shahi? We need to speak to her.

43:51.480 --> 43:53.519
And the other six people
that were at the house that day,

43:53.600 --> 43:55.479
see if anything in their memories...

43:55.560 --> 43:56.919
...that we can use.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.119
Justin?

43:58.200 --> 43:59.719
I'm back
at the Hawksmoor Estate.

44:00.120 --> 44:03.159
The killer filmed Jared Cass begging
for his life, then threw the phone away.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.959
Well, first he removed the SIM card,
and you can't do that with gloves on.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.839
We've got a clean print.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.159
Good, great work.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.599
So, do we bring Barnaby in?

44:14.680 --> 44:16.399
No, come on, it's late

44:16.480 --> 44:18.439
and we ain't even got
his fingerprints on file.

44:18.640 --> 44:19.879
No, but he did it.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.519
What do you want me to do,
call in the SAS?

44:21.600 --> 44:22.639
I've got a dead copper here.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.559
I've got a dead copper
and a woman strangled in her bed.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.519
- Barnaby's a vigilante killer.
- All right!

44:27.480 --> 44:28.679
I'll take care of it.

44:31.080 --> 44:32.439
Jeez, who beat him with a grumpy stick?

44:33.080 --> 44:34.599
I have no idea.

44:34.680 --> 44:37.439
Get me Ken Barnaby's number, please.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.239
Can you sign this, boss?

44:44.520 --> 44:45.919
- Come on, Benny.
- All right.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.599
Cheers.

45:09.080 --> 45:12.839
- Hello?
- Mr Barnaby, it's DCI John Luther

45:12.920 --> 45:15.119
from Serious and Serial,
we spoke earlier.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.919
Yes. Hi, how can I help?

45:18.000 --> 45:22.159
Nothing to worry about at all.
Just, your fingerprints are not on file

45:22.240 --> 45:25.119
and I'd like to, um, well...
take a record of them

45:25.200 --> 45:27.199
just to eliminate you from the enquiry.

45:27.520 --> 45:30.239
Absolutely. No problem.
What time shall I come?

45:30.880 --> 45:33.399
Just after 9:00. Any time after 9:00

45:33.480 --> 45:35.279
and just give your name
to the desk sergeant.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.919
Excellent. Okay, then,
I'll see you in the morning.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.079
All right.

45:56.400 --> 45:59.599
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere, I'm staying here with you.

47:23.440 --> 47:24.879
How is he?

47:28.320 --> 47:30.279
He's going to lose his hand.

47:30.360 --> 47:33.639
That fingerprint's no good without
a finger to compare it to, is it?

47:34.640 --> 47:35.919
His fingerprints are all over the house.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.439
Go and find them.
Dust everything he ever touched.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.079
You've still got to prove

47:40.160 --> 47:43.919
that print belongs to a finger
that doesn't exist any more.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.999
- Oh, we can do that.
- Maybe.

47:46.080 --> 47:49.159
But if I was on the defence team,
I'd argue it into the ground.

47:49.720 --> 47:53.719
And if I was in the jury,
looking at poor Ken Barnaby,

47:53.800 --> 47:55.799
I'd look for any excuse not to convict.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.479
The fingerprint on the SIM card,

47:59.840 --> 48:01.639
that's got Barnaby bang to rights.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.759
All this...

48:04.840 --> 48:09.159
looks like someone trying to give
himself a chance at reasonable doubt.

48:24.600 --> 48:27.919
Dani Shahi, the lodger,
er, married, divorced,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.319
remarried again, is now Dani Lane.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.999
Think it's too late to call?

48:44.680 --> 48:46.679
Smokie!

48:52.520 --> 48:56.359
Smokie. Smokie!

49:20.160 --> 49:21.599
Did you warn him?

49:22.040 --> 49:23.319
Warn who about what?

49:25.520 --> 49:28.839
- Who's that calling so late?
- Hello?

49:28.920 --> 49:30.719
- Did you warn him?
- Sorry, who are we talking about?

49:30.800 --> 49:32.039
- Ken Barnaby.
- Hello?

49:32.120 --> 49:33.599
Yeah, I told him to come in
and get his prints done.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.559
And did you know what'd he'd do?
'Cause you know people, don't you?

49:36.640 --> 49:38.559
You know how they think.

49:38.640 --> 49:39.959
Mate, I'm lost.

49:40.040 --> 49:42.359
Whatever's happened, I promise you,
I had nothing to do with it.

49:42.440 --> 49:43.439
- Again.
- Sorry?

49:43.520 --> 49:44.759
No matter what it is,
it's never you, is it?

49:44.840 --> 49:46.159
Justin, I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.519
There was blood on the ceiling.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.639
- What are you doing? Mmm?
- Right.

49:57.080 --> 49:59.639
- Whatever this is, it ends here and now.
- Huh?

49:59.720 --> 50:02.519
- What is wrong with you, Justin?
- I want you both out of my sight.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.039
Back here tomorrow morning
with this resolved

50:05.120 --> 50:06.319
or you're both suspended.

50:06.400 --> 50:07.879
- John?
- Yes, boss.

50:07.960 --> 50:08.999
Justin?

50:40.520 --> 50:43.479
- Oh. Cold, cold, cold.
- Hmm.

50:43.560 --> 50:45.959
- Your feet are freezing.
- How's the headache?

50:46.040 --> 50:48.199
I haven't got a headache.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.679
Excellent.

50:50.600 --> 50:53.799
- It's too cold for any of that malarkey.
- It'll warm you up.

50:54.800 --> 50:55.999
I'm reading.

51:04.080 --> 51:05.439
Oh!

51:17.200 --> 51:19.399
- What was that?
- I don't know.

51:20.640 --> 51:23.279
I thought I heard it before.
I thought maybe it was...

51:23.360 --> 51:24.439
What?

51:25.840 --> 51:27.159
It sounds like a cat.

51:33.160 --> 51:34.839
What the hell is that?

51:40.560 --> 51:43.479
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

51:43.560 --> 51:45.559
And tell them what?
Our cat's stuck in the attic?

51:45.640 --> 51:47.159
It's weird.

51:54.800 --> 51:57.839
Godforsaken cat.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.639
How did it get up there?

52:03.440 --> 52:04.959
There must be a loose tile

52:05.040 --> 52:08.119
and he's climbed in and can't get out.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.599
Ahhh!

53:28.800 --> 53:30.039
You son of a...

53:33.080 --> 53:35.119
Craig?

55:46.480 --> 55:48.439
The name Luther

55:49.680 --> 55:51.119
comes from my granddad.

55:51.680 --> 55:53.479
- He chose it.
- Why?

55:55.400 --> 55:57.959
- For love.
- That's got to be just about

55:58.040 --> 55:59.839
the best reason
to do anything, doesn't it?

56:00.320 --> 56:01.559
So, uh...

56:02.200 --> 56:04.079
Is it too late for that drink?

56:23.680 --> 56:26.199
Help! Help!

56:26.280 --> 56:28.319
No, seriously, you must...

56:32.640 --> 56:35.599
You're right.
Somebody needs to stop him.

56:39.560 --> 56:43.239
♪ I've got a thing, you've got a thing

56:44.280 --> 56:46.759
♪ Everybody's got a thing ♪

56:46.840 --> 56:47.919
Stop!

56:48.560 --> 56:52.519

Doing our thing

56:52.720 --> 56:56.199

57:09.360 --> 57:10.919
But you're such a gentle man.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.639
I don't know about that.

57:18.680 --> 57:21.599
I'm gonna take you down
twice as hard and twice as fast.
