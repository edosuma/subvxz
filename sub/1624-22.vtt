00:01.640 --> 00:04.070
How could ketchup get this hard?

00:04.070 --> 00:06.420
You just hold it in your hand like this, and say

00:06.420 --> 00:08.940
You are the biggest ketchup I've ever had.

00:11.230 --> 00:13.580
Hey, everybody. I got it, I got it.

00:13.580 --> 00:17.020
Don't panic. At least you caught it in the early stage. 

00:18.100 --> 00:20.840
No, I got the papers so we can see if our ticket win the lottery. 

00:20.840 --> 00:22.840
120 million dollars.

00:22.900 --> 00:26.050
Fine. If we win, I will get an eighth of my trust fund back.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.660
Come on. Now, who's got our ticket?

00:28.670 --> 00:30.990
I've got the ticket. I put it here.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.990
I figured it's for everybody else gets lucky.

00:34.640 --> 00:35.890
By the way, if we win,

00:35.890 --> 00:39.970
I'm gonna buy a condo right next to Great Adventure and go there everyday drunk.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.020
Also put a soda fridge in my garage for show.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.310
Earl, what are you gonna do with your share if we win?

00:47.310 --> 00:49.890
Well, I'll get out of this club chop as fast as I can,

00:49.890 --> 00:52.390
and set me up with some kind of  Hugh Hefner  situation.

00:55.090 --> 00:56.900
Here we go, for the big money.

00:57.170 --> 00:59.380
Woo. If I win, hello Netflix subscription.

01:00.670 --> 01:03.580
We need a six, a ten, a five, a 12 and a nine.

01:03.580 --> 01:05.580
And the first number is¡­6!

01:08.450 --> 01:10.550
And the second number is 47.

01:12.770 --> 01:15.630
Good thing I didn't pay my share of the tickets yet, suckers!

01:33.500 --> 01:36.390
Before I forget, I printed up more of our cupcake business cards

01:36.390 --> 01:38.600
So we can hand them out at the Williamsburg crafts fair.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.070
Oh, can't wait

01:40.120 --> 01:42.050
Me and you handing out free cupcakes 

01:42.050 --> 01:43.920
stuck between hipsters selling crochet

01:43.920 --> 01:46.890
iPad sleeves and salt peppers and salt pepper shakers.

01:47.790 --> 01:50.620
We are not just giving them away for free. It's marketing. 

01:50.620 --> 01:53.090
One person eats it and spreads it around their friends.

01:53.090 --> 01:54.480
So we are herpes.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.140
Hello, Sophie.

02:00.180 --> 02:03.590
If you looked any sweeter, you would fire up my diabetes.

02:05.720 --> 02:09.300
Oh, Earl. You wouldn't be the first man to lose a limo over me.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.930
Sophie, I'm surprised to see you in here.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.980
Stutter buzz says you and Oleg are no longer together.

02:17.410 --> 02:20.040
Wow, this little girl likes to gossip. Yes?

02:21.590 --> 02:23.740
Won't you scutter your little butt over there

02:23.740 --> 02:25.840
and get me the menu the way you are supposed to?

02:25.840 --> 02:27.840
Hey, Max, Caroline.

02:27.890 --> 02:30.010
Come see me in my booth.

02:30.930 --> 02:34.200
Are we over here so Oleg can't see you through the kitchen window?

02:34.300 --> 02:38.380
What is this? Diner or back issue of Cosmopolitan magazines?

02:38.930 --> 02:40.630
I grew up reading Cosmo. 

02:40.630 --> 02:44.300
 I mean, what a six-year-old doesn't need to know? The hidden male erogenous zones.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.300
It's the nipples, the end.

02:47.540 --> 02:50.600
I came to give you girls a cleaning job tomorrow.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.920
We can't tomorrow. We are doing the crafts fair.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.430
We are turning down a real paying job to go to the crap fair?

02:56.830 --> 02:59.880
Yes, it's important that we focus on the cupcake business.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.780
And you can't spell "focus" without "us".

03:02.780 --> 03:04.870
Or FU.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.400
Hello, Sophie.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.400
Hello, Oleg.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.950
So, do you miss the sex?

03:14.950 --> 03:16.240
Oh, you know what? We should go.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.850
No. We are having a conversation here.

03:18.850 --> 03:22.310
And besides, the sex was not that good.

03:22.310 --> 03:24.710
Oh, it was that good.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.230
It wasn't that good.

03:27.230 --> 03:29.230
Please, I beg you. Let us go.

03:29.230 --> 03:31.230
You can go. I'm kind of into it.

03:31.910 --> 03:34.250
Like, it's like a dirty Downton Abbey.

03:36.110 --> 03:37.760
So why are you still standing there

03:37.760 --> 03:40.370
giving me those sad, cow eyes 

03:40.550 --> 03:42.370
in that brown velure.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.370
Because it's a good look on me.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.180
And because I'm waiting for you to admit that you came here

03:49.180 --> 03:50.630
because you miss the sex.

03:51.210 --> 03:53.190
I miss summers in Minsk. 

03:53.390 --> 03:55.790
I miss smoking in hospitals.

04:02.030 --> 04:04.030
But I don't miss the sex.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.080
Fine, then. What would you like to eat?

04:07.140 --> 04:09.870
I'll have my usual sausage.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.600
Ok, ding. It's ready.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.580
Max's homemade cupcakes.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.960
Max's delicious homemade cupcakes

04:27.730 --> 04:30.470
- Let's move this along. Max's homemade cupcakes. - Max.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.260
come on. Could you at least try and have a better attitude at the crafts fair?

04:36.300 --> 04:41.450
I was doing fine until my hair got gang feather by that girl from that church of good vibes.

04:44.030 --> 04:45.700
Hi!

04:45.700 --> 04:47.998
I'm from the Funnel Cake booth back there

04:47.998 --> 04:52.790
and your little table is sadder than watching the notebook at a funeral.

04:55.870 --> 04:58.000
Hey Dutch girl,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.370
why don't you go stick your finger in a dyke.

05:02.150 --> 05:05.340
I'm sure you can find one over near the plus sized in them.

05:10.550 --> 05:13.070
Max, please. We are all business woman here. 

05:13.070 --> 05:15.260
Yeah. Some of us wearing table cloth on their heads.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.590
Just so you know they make shift tables cause we are just starting out.

05:19.590 --> 05:21.480
We've only been in business eight months.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.590
Heidi, how long have we been funneling?

05:24.590 --> 05:28.400
Everyday 24-7 for the past three months.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.370
And we already have a booth.

05:30.370 --> 05:31.820
Yeah we do.

05:33.090 --> 05:36.140
I have to say you girls really take the fun out of funnel.

05:36.140 --> 05:39.430
Actually we put the fun in the funnel.

05:39.430 --> 05:42.900
See? You can't start "funnel" without "fun".

05:43.400 --> 05:44.900
Or FU.

05:51.530 --> 05:54.200
Three months and they've already had a booth. We're behind.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.600
Max's homemade cupcakes. 

05:55.600 --> 05:57.030
Take this!

05:58.910 --> 06:00.220
See? Success!

06:00.520 --> 06:03.170
Scaring people into participating isn't success.

06:03.170 --> 06:05.030
It's Scientology.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.890
Calling Sophie we're taking that job.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.730
You'd better have a good reason you're late,

06:18.730 --> 06:23.600
because I managed to get here on time despite removing the disease pigeon feathers from my hair.

06:24.530 --> 06:25.280
I do.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.990
So today when we were cleaning up that apartment and I had my hands in a total stranger's toilet,

06:29.990 --> 06:34.110
I realized if we're really gonna be successful, we've got to think outside the bull.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.720
So after I thoroughly washed my hands, 

06:36.720 --> 06:38.550
I know they never really come off though, right?

06:38.550 --> 06:39.980
Off your soul, I mean.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.830
I made a call to a connection I know and got us a real cupcake job.

06:44.830 --> 06:49.280
And it's in Manhattan. It's the first birthday party for the son of a socialite.

06:49.450 --> 06:52.860
60 cupcakes with buttercream frosting. Up top.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.120
Buttercream?

06:54.250 --> 06:57.010
This is not the response I was expecting from my business partner.

06:57.010 --> 07:00.670
I was expecting wooo! Awesome job! Thumbs up, buddy. 

07:01.480 --> 07:04.420
Why? Is your business partner on a show of Nicklodeon?

07:06.300 --> 07:08.400
Look I don't do buttercream. 

07:08.400 --> 07:09.840
Buttercream is a bitch.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.890
If it doesn't stay refrigerated, it falls apart as fast as a two-celebrity marriage.

07:15.780 --> 07:18.690
Max we have to take this job, it's the next step for us, 

07:18.720 --> 07:22.070
cause all we're doing these days is cleaning apartment and working at the diner.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.880
That's not all I'm doing. I also babysit for Peach.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.400
Oh, Peach is fine with it.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.280
Why would Peach be fine with it?

07:28.280 --> 07:31.250
Look I was gonna tell you this after the Nickelodeon high five

07:31.250 --> 07:33.740
but that didn't happen and I got thrown.

07:33.740 --> 07:36.050
Peach is the connection I used to get us the party.

07:36.050 --> 07:39.300
You called Peach without asking me and begged her for a job?

07:39.300 --> 07:42.195
I didn't beg. I ask her if she knew anybody who could use us

07:42.195 --> 07:44.780
and she was more than happy to recommend us for her friend Constance.

07:44.780 --> 07:47.100
No way I'm not comfortable with this.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.680
Sometimes you have to do things that make you uncomfortable.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.753
It's the way you grow.

07:50.753 --> 07:54.560
No it's the way you get a ride home from a keger in the woods.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.990
♪Max
Max.

07:56.990 --> 08:00.440
Max Max I'm sorry but we can't turn into those people who work and work

08:00.440 --> 08:03.590
just to pay their bill don't have any time to pursue their dreams.

08:03.590 --> 08:04.970
You mean Americans?

08:07.260 --> 08:11.060
I'm telling Peach tomorrow we're not doing it. Now go get some milk.

08:11.060 --> 08:14.670
No problem cause that's what waitresses do and

08:14.670 --> 08:16.670
apparently that's all we'll ever be.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.440
What? 

08:33.440 --> 08:36.090
I have to prove the sex was not that good.

08:37.230 --> 08:39.030
Oleg on the food?

08:39.030 --> 08:40.320
Don't say it like that,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.919
That ham was already glaced before we go there. 

08:54.340 --> 08:56.350
So I am guessing you are back together?

08:56.350 --> 08:59.080
Oh no no, the sex was not that good.

09:00.230 --> 09:01.950
Oh, it was that good.

09:09.740 --> 09:11.360
I went to get Mayo,

09:12.390 --> 09:14.360
and it all happened so fast.

09:32.340 --> 09:36.450
Ok babies, give me fashion, give me a face, yea.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.941
Peach, I don't know what's going on in your apartment, 

09:38.941 --> 09:41.090
but I would like it on the record:

09:41.250 --> 09:43.270
I'm not a willing accomplice.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.510
So what is going on here?

09:45.510 --> 09:48.430
Well, Brad is giving us seduction like his name sake

09:48.430 --> 09:51.180
and Angelina is giving us nothing like her name sake.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.730
This is pretty fancy set up, were the kids nominated for an Oscar?

09:55.730 --> 09:58.760
Best performance by twins in a ridiculous situation?

09:59.300 --> 10:01.380
It's a photo spread for my new mummy blog,

10:01.380 --> 10:04.780
I'm calling it Mummy and Me. Isn't that clever?

10:05.180 --> 10:06.780
And original.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.790
I had a blog since my friend Constance started her blog,

10:09.790 --> 10:12.380
we both have blogs and we both have babies.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.490
Only her babies are adopted from Africa.

10:14.490 --> 10:17.500
She will be winning if I didn't have two from a poor white hell billy thuggery.

10:21.180 --> 10:24.760
About your friend Constance, I think I was supposed to do a party for her.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.070
Max, please don't screw this up because I hate her and I need her to love me.

10:28.980 --> 10:31.710
Yea, here is the thing. Thank you,

10:31.710 --> 10:34.520
but Caroline should never have called you and asked you for a favor.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.964
I'm not comfortable asking to do that.

10:35.964 --> 10:38.446
But I did it for you.

10:38.446 --> 10:40.161
And now you will do that for me.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.410
And Max this has to go swimmingly

10:42.410 --> 10:44.380
which is a new word I just learned.

10:45.430 --> 10:47.330
So you are saying I can't get out of it?

10:47.330 --> 10:50.040
I'm saying: Max, you can't get out of it.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.570
Max, still not talking to me because of the Peach thing?

10:57.380 --> 10:58.310
Fine.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.600
Those are some pretty bad ass buttercream cupcakes,

11:02.600 --> 11:04.890
ain't no drama going on in that box!

11:06.990 --> 11:09.980
Ok, I just went gangster, and not even a smile?

11:09.980 --> 11:12.250
What? Are you planning to never talk to me again?

11:13.280 --> 11:15.710
You nodded, if you were deaf that would be talking.

11:16.570 --> 11:18.210
That's true, my brother is deaf,

11:18.540 --> 11:20.670
not from birth, from firecrackers.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.761
Relax, we still have time.

11:23.761 --> 11:26.345
Ten more minutes on the train and a 15-minute walk.

11:26.345 --> 11:28.350
The buttercreams are not gonna melt.

11:28.350 --> 11:31.050
- Some people just like to create non-verbal drama. - En huh.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.780
Attention passengers.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.880
- There is an obstruction up on the track ahead. - No.

11:41.180 --> 11:43.550
I bet someone jumped in front of the train.

11:43.550 --> 11:45.868
Oh my God, what a tragedy, 

11:45.869 --> 11:47.930
the buttercream!

11:54.990 --> 11:56.044
Attention passengers.

11:56.044 --> 11:58.051
We apologize for this delay.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.590
There is still an obstruction on the tracks ahead.

12:00.590 --> 12:02.870
It's totally like a body.

12:02.870 --> 12:04.550
They can't get it off and what not.

12:05.730 --> 12:07.360
We should be moving shortly.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.140
What is with this guy? He said that 20 minutes ago.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.870
How are your cupcakes? Mine are getting a little loose.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.870
Still? Still not talking?

12:16.220 --> 12:18.200
Fine, Max. Now I'm not talking neither.

12:18.580 --> 12:21.640
What is with her? She said that 20 minutes ago, too.

12:22.570 --> 12:25.470
And she just keeps talking.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.610
I know, right?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.160
We probably hit the body.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.280
So it is all up in the wheeling and what not.

12:32.370 --> 12:35.960
Well, if there is what not under our wheels, and I don't get these cupcakes there,

12:35.960 --> 12:38.130
I'm going to lose my babysitting job.

12:38.130 --> 12:40.155
- Are we babysitters or bakers? - I was talking to him.

12:40.155 --> 12:41.758
Stay out of this.

12:41.758 --> 12:42.610
Nina,

12:42.610 --> 12:45.236
if you two are bakers, maybe you should break up some of those cupcakes,

12:45.236 --> 12:46.820
so we all don't starve.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.665
No one is touching these cupcakes.

12:48.665 --> 12:52.110
Our entire future is riding on these mothers.

12:51.890 --> 12:54.160
I think I'm smelling like a, like a dead body smell.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.650
Miss, you are making things so much worse in here.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.510
Are you telling me you don't smell that?

12:59.510 --> 13:03.180
It's like when my sister burned herself throwing firecrackers at my brother's ear.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.190
This train is out of service.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.520
We are approximately two blocks away from the next station.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.060
We're gonna have to take you on foot.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.140
Please form a single line and we will escort you to safety.

13:17.140 --> 13:18.310
We are gonna walk?

13:18.310 --> 13:20.890
They expect me to walk through a subway tunnel in heels?

13:20.890 --> 13:23.970
Hey everybody I think we know who we are gonna eat first.

13:27.350 --> 13:30.530
My god, it's so hot up in here. It's like 200 degrees.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.124
If I faint and fall down,

13:32.124 --> 13:34.290
the others rats will like eat me and what not.

13:34.870 --> 13:36.890
Rats? Max, are there rats?

13:36.890 --> 13:39.440
It's a subway. The floor is made of rats,

13:39.660 --> 13:41.840
but you really have to worry about, the ninja turtles.

13:43.270 --> 13:44.710
Thank you for responding.

13:44.710 --> 13:45.770
Hold up.

13:46.030 --> 13:48.830
I'm telling you right now. If I lose my babysitting job over this,

13:48.830 --> 13:51.430
the rats would be the better option for you.

13:51.430 --> 13:54.160
We are only two blocks from the station. We can still make it.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.980
How are your cupcakes?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.770
They are still holding together.

13:59.770 --> 14:02.050
Like us. We are still holding together.

14:02.390 --> 14:05.970
Geez, come on, don't bring gal. Less talk more walk.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.380
Folks, It's a bit of gap here.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.100
A gap? There can't be a gap. Why is there a gap?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.450
Because people need reasonably price basics.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.320
I'm gonna hop across and help the rest of you over.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.206
Hey miss, you are next.

14:23.206 --> 14:25.117
I put the line on, just grab it.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.873
You know how many times I heard that from a guy in the tunnel?

14:28.400 --> 14:29.960
Hey, just take these.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.150
Careful, sir, it's buttercream!

14:34.400 --> 14:36.520
I'm throwing you my purse. Here it comes.

14:42.010 --> 14:43.870
Thank you. Right. Thank you.

14:43.870 --> 14:45.250
Ok, miss, you next.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.250
Hand me over the cupcakes and jump.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.662
I can't. I'm terrified.

14:50.662 --> 14:52.875
What if I fall? The rats will eat me.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.100
I can never come back from that.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.711
Bankruptcy? Yes. Rats? No.

14:55.711 --> 14:56.973
"Hey Caroline, where are your toes?"

14:56.973 --> 14:58.972
"Well, it's a long story."

14:58.580 --> 15:00.446
Girl, if you fall that third rail,

15:00.446 --> 15:03.181
it will fry you way before the rats get there.

15:03.181 --> 15:06.244
Listen, Mariah, you are freaking me out.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.460
If we're lucky, the rats will eat your mouth.

15:10.280 --> 15:14.230
Caroline, it's ok. It's just a step. Take the step.

15:14.590 --> 15:16.060
Hold these.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.200
Come on, I'm right here.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.670
I took the step, now you have to take the step.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.650
That's right. You did. I do.

15:24.350 --> 15:25.727
Here we go.

15:25.727 --> 15:27.571
Back up everybody. Yea!

15:27.571 --> 15:29.916
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

15:30.020 --> 15:32.199
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

15:32.199 --> 15:35.183
Go Caroline, go Caroline, ahhhhhhh!

15:35.183 --> 15:37.680
I saw a rat. We made eye contact.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.520
You know what? It would probably be easier if took those heels off.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.251
Sir, that is never going to happen.

15:44.251 --> 15:45.521
We are in Manhattan.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.670
I may be under it but I'm still in it.

15:48.670 --> 15:50.152
And when they pull out my half-eaten body,

15:50.152 --> 15:53.530
I will be wearing my heels.

15:58.230 --> 15:59.002
Mariah?

15:59.002 --> 16:01.536
Why? I only have one.

16:01.536 --> 16:02.197
What are you gonna do? 

16:02.197 --> 16:05.204
Jump back over and do something and whatnot?

16:07.280 --> 16:10.040
Constance, we're sorry, we are late.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.630
I don't wait. I don't wait for anything.

16:12.630 --> 16:14.980
I already have the iPhone 8.

16:14.980 --> 16:17.670
Sorry, we couldn't help it. We were trapped on the subway.

16:17.670 --> 16:19.690
Well, just put some cupcakes on a plate

16:19.690 --> 16:23.470
cause I got a roomful of women out there who need to cut something in half

16:23.470 --> 16:27.440
and then eat the other half, and they need to do it now!

16:28.800 --> 16:32.090
Welcome back to Manhattan. How do they look?

16:32.830 --> 16:35.400
Like they all had unprotected sex with each other?

16:36.890 --> 16:40.740
Oh, how are you two? I'm looking for the babies, I'm about just ten seconds I'm just giving up.

16:41.650 --> 16:44.530
- Peach, there is a problem with the cupcakes.  - There can't be.

16:44.530 --> 16:47.720
Constance will kill me, literally. Her last two best friends went missing.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.760
That is not attractive at all.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.440
Is... is that what food looks like?

16:56.510 --> 17:00.030
Why are there no cupcakes out? If you two work for me, I deport you.

17:01.250 --> 17:05.839
There is a bit of cupcake situation. The buttercream sort of broke down on the way up.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.670
It's not a problem, we can fix it.

17:09.670 --> 17:13.109
I'll just run to a delly get what we need to touch them up and no one's the wiser.

17:13.180 --> 17:17.800
And I take the full responsibility. My partner warned me that buttercream was a bitch.

17:18.730 --> 17:21.079
I'm not being rude, that's technical baking term.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.140
You expect me to pay 300 dollars for these?

17:24.810 --> 17:28.329
Caroline Channing, I have to say that you're a bigger con artist than your father.

17:28.810 --> 17:32.050
Then I have to say you're a bigger bitch than the buttercream.

17:33.290 --> 17:35.550
I'm not your boss, so I can't hit you.

17:38.070 --> 17:40.610
But I'm sure that Peach won't be your boss much longer either.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.380
Right, Peach?

17:42.380 --> 17:44.000
But I love Max.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.370
She's been with me since I bought the twins.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.900
I can't live without her.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.660
You are never coming to another one of my parties.

17:50.660 --> 17:51.880
Max, you're fired.

17:59.300 --> 18:02.510
It's my fault. You lost your babysitting job, and I feel awful.

18:02.550 --> 18:05.230
Hey, I'm the one who call that bitch a "bitch".

18:05.230 --> 18:08.410
And I'm gonna write those awesome films right up until we got evicted.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.980
Why can't you just admit that the sex was that good?

18:14.580 --> 18:19.020
You know it, I know it, the ham with the bite marks in the freezer knows it.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.460
Ok, fine. The sex was that good,

18:24.500 --> 18:26.460
as was the ham.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.700
It was that good because it was more than just sex.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.100
It was love.

18:32.590 --> 18:35.790
Oh... it is not love.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.830
Oh, it is love.

18:37.830 --> 18:41.070
Oh... it is not love.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.990
It was dirty, disgusting sex.

18:47.230 --> 18:49.540
Yes, it was.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.770
Oleg, do you really love Sophie?

18:56.770 --> 19:00.120
Yes, I do. And one day I will kiss her.

19:00.630 --> 19:03.000
Her lips will be mine.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.920
Wait, you never kissed her?

19:06.360 --> 19:08.190
Not on the lips of her face.

19:13.410 --> 19:15.130
But that day will come.

19:17.530 --> 19:20.250
Man, I can't believe that I'm actually saying this,

19:20.250 --> 19:23.340
but that is pretty freaking romantic.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.920
I'm looking for Max, I think her last name is "Black".

19:29.810 --> 19:32.070
Oh, sorry, maybe it's "African American"?

19:34.530 --> 19:37.730
You think her name is "Max African American"?

19:38.650 --> 19:41.190
Peach, what're you doing here? Who's with the twins?

19:41.190 --> 19:43.200
They're in the car, don't worry,

19:43.200 --> 19:45.920
I rolled up the windows and locked the doors, so they're safe.

19:47.940 --> 19:51.220
Max, I'm sorry for pretending to fire you in front of the Constance.

19:51.220 --> 19:53.270
Pretended? That felt pretty real.

19:53.270 --> 19:57.800
Yeah, I'm good. My fake orgasms are so real even I believe them.

19:59.020 --> 20:02.360
Peach, this is all my fault. Please give Max her job back.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.950
That's why I'm here. Max, come back, I need you to watch them tomorrow,

20:06.270 --> 20:07.680
and then everyday.

20:08.950 --> 20:11.010
Peach, I don't think I can work for you tomorrow,

20:11.450 --> 20:12.590
or any other day.

20:13.450 --> 20:15.180
We have to focus on our business.

20:16.150 --> 20:18.300
Max, are you sure you're comfortable with this?

20:18.460 --> 20:21.040
No, I'm not comfortable, but that's the point, right?

20:21.040 --> 20:22.420
You gotta take a step.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.270
Well, then how about just for another year?

20:25.590 --> 20:27.860
By then the twins will be old enough to take care of themselves.

20:31.030 --> 20:34.940
No, but I promise I'll come by and say "Hi" to the twins whenever I can.

20:34.940 --> 20:36.240
Oh, Max,

20:36.580 --> 20:39.520
I will never find someone as wonderful as you who speaks English.

20:42.700 --> 20:43.570
Bye, Max.

20:45.610 --> 20:48.510
Wow, good for you, good for us.

20:48.510 --> 20:52.640
Hope so. That's the first job I ever quit without a job to take its place.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.250
You have another job. You work for yourself.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.970
You're your own boss.

20:56.970 --> 21:00.980
My own boss? I can't wait to sleep with myself to get a promotion.
