00:02.314 --> 00:04.043
You are being watched...

00:04.886 --> 00:07.320
The government
has a secret system--

00:07.322 --> 00:11.942
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.943 --> 00:14.144
I know, because I built it.

00:14.146 --> 00:16.178
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:16.181 --> 00:17.781
but it sees everything...

00:17.783 --> 00:21.118
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:21.120 --> 00:22.569
people like you,

00:22.571 --> 00:26.239
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:26.241 --> 00:29.609
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:29.611 --> 00:31.828
But I needed a partner--

00:31.830 --> 00:34.631
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:34.633 --> 00:38.385
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:38.387 --> 00:40.337
You'll never find us.

00:40.339 --> 00:42.305
But victim or perpetrator,

00:42.307 --> 00:45.342
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

What is your emergency?

00:55.487 --> 00:56.770
Got a flat tire.

00:56.772 --> 00:58.471
They won't turn
their music down.

00:58.473 --> 01:01.358
I just know
he's sleeping with her.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.777
Please help me!
It's my brother.

01:03.779 --> 01:05.745
They shot him.
Please, send someone.

must have gotten to you.

Only the paranoid survive--

01:42.034 --> 01:43.850
Sage advice.

01:43.852 --> 01:48.238
Well, I'll need to rebuild
all my systems from scratch,

01:48.240 --> 01:51.041
reinforce the firewall.

01:51.043 --> 01:52.542
Anything I can do?

01:52.544 --> 01:53.877
Yes.

01:53.879 --> 01:57.196
New number...

01:57.198 --> 01:58.999
Just came in this morning.

01:59.001 --> 02:00.717
Even with the library offline?

02:00.719 --> 02:04.204
His name is Darren McGrady,
14 years old.

02:04.206 --> 02:05.672
That's his last known address.

02:05.674 --> 02:06.973
You better get started.

02:06.975 --> 02:08.508
[Power drill whirring]

02:24.659 --> 02:26.610
Hey, Finch...

02:26.612 --> 02:28.445
Any chance your machine gave us

02:28.447 --> 02:29.946
the number a few days late?

02:29.948 --> 02:31.397
No. Why?

02:31.399 --> 02:33.733
Because I had to crawl
through police tape

02:33.735 --> 02:35.919
to get
inside Darren's apartment.

02:35.921 --> 02:37.871
The library
may have been compromised,

02:37.873 --> 02:39.973
but I can assure you
that the machine was not.

02:39.975 --> 02:41.074
Whatever happened there,

02:41.076 --> 02:45.295
Darren's situation
must be ongoing.

02:45.297 --> 02:47.847
Looks like a home invasion.

02:47.849 --> 02:50.967
So whose blood is on the floor?

02:55.773 --> 03:00.093
Hey.
Who are you?

03:00.095 --> 03:01.695
Detective Stills.

03:01.697 --> 03:03.530
- You the super?
- That's right.

03:03.532 --> 03:05.815
A little late
for the party, aren't you?

03:05.817 --> 03:07.867
Mind telling me
what happened here?

03:07.869 --> 03:10.787
What it looks like--
One of my tenants got shot...

03:10.789 --> 03:12.238
About a week ago.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.940
Older kid--
Travis McGrady.

03:13.942 --> 03:15.425
Damn shame.

03:15.427 --> 03:17.460
Real good
about paying rent on time.

03:17.462 --> 03:20.046
Travis had
a younger brother, Darren.

03:20.048 --> 03:22.549
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

03:22.551 --> 03:24.718
Cops took him with them.

03:27.972 --> 03:29.973
Hey, when can I clean
this place up

03:29.975 --> 03:31.975
and get a new tenant in here?

03:40.151 --> 03:42.519
Morning, Detective.

03:42.521 --> 03:43.636
Miss me?

03:43.638 --> 03:45.304
You know, I always pictured you

03:45.306 --> 03:48.525
in the back of my car...
In handcuffs.

03:48.527 --> 03:50.610
Well, to each his own.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.912
Any luck pulling that file?

03:52.914 --> 03:54.914
Travis McGrady--

03:54.916 --> 03:57.701
Took two shots to the chest,
point blank.

03:57.703 --> 03:59.586
Three black males
were seen fleeing the building.

03:59.588 --> 04:02.288
What about the brother, Darren?

04:02.290 --> 04:03.873
Came home
right after it happened,

04:03.875 --> 04:05.709
found Travis bleeding out.

04:05.711 --> 04:07.326
Says here he called 911.

04:07.328 --> 04:08.345
Yeah, it took half an hour

04:08.347 --> 04:10.213
for first responders
to show up.

04:10.215 --> 04:11.715
Travis was already dead.

04:11.717 --> 04:13.166
What happened to the parents?

04:13.168 --> 04:14.634
No father in the picture.

04:14.636 --> 04:17.137
Mother died of renal failure
three years ago,

04:17.139 --> 04:19.805
so Travis was Darren's
legal guardian.

04:19.808 --> 04:23.009
Now he's got nobody.

04:23.011 --> 04:24.344
Any idea where he is now?

04:24.346 --> 04:25.344
Missing.

04:25.346 --> 04:26.479
Kid waited all night

04:26.481 --> 04:28.615
at the precinct
for Child Services.

04:28.617 --> 04:31.351
When they didn't show up,
he just up and walked out.

04:31.353 --> 04:32.685
I need to track him down...

04:32.687 --> 04:34.154
- Fast.
- Hey.

04:34.156 --> 04:36.689
You ever gonna tell me
exactly how you and your friend

04:36.691 --> 04:38.408
pick the people you're chasing?

04:43.030 --> 04:44.297
All right.

04:44.299 --> 04:46.883
I'll talk to the detective
assigned on the case,

04:46.885 --> 04:49.502
see if there's anything he left
out of that report.

04:49.504 --> 04:51.838
Like how he lost the kid.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.257
Since when
does a homicide task force

04:54.259 --> 04:56.509
want in on a shooting
in Crown Heights?

04:56.511 --> 04:58.978
Don't you have something
more high profile to work--

04:58.980 --> 05:01.181
Like that guy
who's kneecapping everybody?

05:01.183 --> 05:04.317
Chief of "D"s wants to polish
compstat numbers--

05:04.319 --> 05:07.020
Ordered us to climb
on any open cases.

05:07.022 --> 05:09.823
Okay.
It goes like this.

05:09.825 --> 05:13.326
Last Friday the victim
was working at the--

05:13.328 --> 05:15.111
Travis, right?

05:15.113 --> 05:16.562
His name is Travis.

05:16.564 --> 05:18.064
Right.

05:18.066 --> 05:19.365
Well, this Travis--

05:19.367 --> 05:22.118
He's working the late shift
at the Thighs & Fries.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.104
Got into an altercation
with three males

05:24.106 --> 05:25.338
over some waitress.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.923
Somebody got frisky,

05:26.925 --> 05:28.925
Travis went at him,
tossed him out the joint.

05:28.927 --> 05:32.345
Same three guys seen later
fleeing his apartment building.

05:32.347 --> 05:33.596
I figure they left
the restaurant.

05:33.598 --> 05:36.132
They followed Travis
on his way home from work.

05:36.134 --> 05:37.416
You know the rest.

05:37.418 --> 05:41.420
The little brother-- He said, uh,
they took his work hat.

05:41.422 --> 05:43.223
Any leads
on the three suspects?

05:43.225 --> 05:45.225
Waitress give a description,
anything?

05:45.227 --> 05:46.926
In that neighborhood?

05:46.928 --> 05:48.478
Are you kidding?

05:48.480 --> 05:50.596
Ain't nobody gonna dime out
those thugs.

05:50.598 --> 05:53.983
Any progress on finding
the little brother, Darren?

05:53.985 --> 05:56.069
I don't have time to chase
after every kid

05:56.071 --> 05:57.770
- who can't sit still.
- Of course not.

05:57.772 --> 05:59.122
When I find him,

05:59.124 --> 06:02.492
I'll let him know
you were a big help.

06:07.131 --> 06:09.382
Sounds like Darren's brother
picked a fight

06:09.384 --> 06:10.950
with the wrong crowd.

06:10.952 --> 06:13.786
If they think
Darren saw anything that night,

06:13.788 --> 06:15.638
they'll be looking
to silence him next.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.307
So we don't have a clue
where Darren is

06:17.309 --> 06:18.291
or who the shooters are.

06:18.293 --> 06:20.143
Witnesses can ID the shooters.

06:20.145 --> 06:21.811
They're just too scared.

06:21.813 --> 06:23.730
Why would they want
to talk to you?

06:25.316 --> 06:27.984
I have my ways.

06:34.325 --> 06:35.658
Excuse me.

06:35.660 --> 06:38.144
Lisa?

06:38.146 --> 06:39.746
Sorry.
I'm running late for something.

06:39.748 --> 06:42.081
Besides, I already told
the police everything I know

06:42.083 --> 06:43.500
about Travis and those guys.

06:43.502 --> 06:44.667
I'm not a cop.

06:44.669 --> 06:46.953
I'm looking for Darren McGrady,

06:46.955 --> 06:48.821
Travis' little brother.

06:48.823 --> 06:50.990
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

06:50.992 --> 06:52.759
I know you're afraid...

06:52.761 --> 06:54.827
Just like I'm sure
Travis was scared

06:54.829 --> 06:57.347
when he stuck up for you
against those thugs.

06:57.349 --> 06:59.165
But he did it anyway.

07:02.336 --> 07:04.771
Those guys come in there
all the time,

07:04.773 --> 07:06.606
grabbing and hollering.

07:06.608 --> 07:08.808
I don't know what the hell
he was thinking.

07:08.810 --> 07:11.110
He cared for you...

07:11.112 --> 07:14.197
Just like he cared
for his little brother, Darren.

07:14.199 --> 07:18.368
The guys that killed Travis
may be coming after Darren now.

07:18.370 --> 07:20.670
I need your help
tracking them down.

07:22.323 --> 07:24.123
Look, I want to help, but--

07:24.125 --> 07:26.459
You don't have
to give me a name.

07:26.461 --> 07:28.861
Just point me
in the right direction.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.634
Guy like you,
coming out of the shadows,

07:34.636 --> 07:36.869
looking for bad guys,

07:36.871 --> 07:40.056
you'd fit right in
at the comic book store...

07:40.058 --> 07:41.925
Couple blocks that way.

07:41.927 --> 07:44.477
They hang out there.

07:44.479 --> 07:46.379
Thanks.

07:52.736 --> 07:54.687
Okay, kids, free comics.

07:54.689 --> 07:56.722
There you go--
One for you.

07:56.724 --> 07:58.107

07:58.109 --> 07:59.859
Hey.
Good to see you again.

07:59.861 --> 08:01.945
All right.

Mr. Wilcox,

08:03.448 --> 08:04.948
what's this dude's superpower?

08:04.950 --> 08:06.833
He got no costume, no cape.

08:06.835 --> 08:10.569
'Cause being a superhero
is not about a cape or a cowl.

08:10.571 --> 08:12.505
It's about protecting
your fellow man,

when no one else will.

08:17.796 --> 08:20.546
Uh...
Excuse you.

Hey, Carter, I may have found
one of our shooters--

Corner of Crown and Albany,
headed south.

08:25.753 --> 08:30.690
I'm two minutes away,
be right there.

08:32.275 --> 08:34.794
Finch, I got eyes on Darren.

08:34.796 --> 08:37.230
Is he safe, Mr. Reese?

08:37.232 --> 08:38.764
- Not for long.
- Hey, yo, Brick.

08:38.765 --> 08:41.067
Take off that hat.

08:41.068 --> 08:44.570
Who do you think
you're talking to, shorty?

08:44.572 --> 08:47.123
One of the spineless punks
that killed my brother--

08:47.125 --> 08:49.242
Shot him dead in our home.

08:49.244 --> 08:51.544
Want me to show you how to use
that thing, little man?

08:52.496 --> 08:53.946
[Gunshot]

08:53.948 --> 08:56.165
What the hell you doing, man?
Get off of me.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.967
This fool is as good as dead.

08:57.969 --> 08:59.385
- Yo...
- I won't miss.

08:59.387 --> 09:01.754
- Give that back!
- Drop your phone.

09:01.756 --> 09:02.955
Get off me, man.

09:02.957 --> 09:04.674
Hey, don't worry, man.
This ain't over.

09:04.676 --> 09:06.893
I'ma kill you
and the rest of your crew.

09:06.895 --> 09:08.127
Yeah, we'll see about that.

09:08.129 --> 09:09.312
My boys
will be looking for you.

09:09.314 --> 09:10.730
I see you made friends
as usual.

09:10.732 --> 09:11.898
Found our missing kid.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.650
Now I got to get him
out of here.

09:13.652 --> 09:14.600
He's your murder suspect.

09:14.602 --> 09:15.968
Get down on the ground.

09:15.970 --> 09:18.104
Put your hands
behind your head now.

09:18.106 --> 09:19.522
[Sirens wailing]

09:19.524 --> 09:20.806
Where you going?

09:20.808 --> 09:23.242
Got to get him somewhere safe.

09:23.244 --> 09:24.643
Sorry.

09:39.468 --> 09:42.169
All units, please respond

09:42.171 --> 09:44.221
to shots fired in the vicinity
of Crown and--

09:44.223 --> 09:45.639
[Radio turns off]

09:45.641 --> 09:47.541
Didn't know cops
could pick and choose

09:47.543 --> 09:48.759
which calls to answer.

09:48.761 --> 09:51.145
Never said I was a cop.

09:51.147 --> 09:53.547
So what are you, then?

09:53.549 --> 09:55.316
One of these days
I'll have to come up

09:55.318 --> 09:57.050
with a good answer
for that one.

09:57.052 --> 09:58.552
It's a nice piece,

09:58.554 --> 10:01.555
considering you bought it
off the street.

10:01.557 --> 10:02.606
Where'd you get the cash?

10:02.608 --> 10:05.192
Pawned a TV, sold some stuff.

10:05.194 --> 10:06.727
Saw you play the trumpet.

10:06.729 --> 10:08.395
I'm guessing
you pawned that too.

10:08.397 --> 10:11.282
- You any good?
- What do you think?

10:14.669 --> 10:18.205
My brother wanted me
to go to music school...

10:18.207 --> 10:20.458
Instead of getting mixed up
with the thugs.

10:20.460 --> 10:24.311
And here you are,
mixed up with the thugs.

10:26.848 --> 10:28.415
So you tracked down
that Brick kid.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.750
You think
that's what your brother

10:29.752 --> 10:31.084
would have wanted you to do?

10:31.086 --> 10:32.303
Saw him wearing that hat

a lot more questions.

11:16.131 --> 11:17.815
You leave Carter to me.

11:17.817 --> 11:19.517
Now, is this place safe?

11:19.519 --> 11:21.301
Yeah.
She likes to help kids.

11:21.303 --> 11:22.803
She hates paperwork.

11:22.805 --> 11:24.572
She takes in strays
all the time.

11:24.574 --> 11:26.073
I'm not a stray.

11:26.075 --> 11:29.159
- He'll be safe here.
- Good.

11:29.161 --> 11:32.079
I'll be back, but until then,
he doesn't leave your sight.

11:32.081 --> 11:33.697
Yo, you really
gonna leave me here?

- Found it.
- Where?

12:08.734 --> 12:11.702
In the street.
I like the way it fit.

12:11.704 --> 12:13.520
Yeah, well, that hat
is in the lab right now.

34:14.215 --> 34:16.583
[Cell phone beeps]

34:16.585 --> 34:17.717
There you are.

34:17.719 --> 34:20.003
Anonymous tip
just came in, Detective.

34:20.005 --> 34:21.871
Got you the murder weapon.

34:21.873 --> 34:23.373
You can go ahead
and charge Brick.

34:23.375 --> 34:24.875
It's gonna be
kind of difficult.

34:24.877 --> 34:27.594
I just released him
ten minutes ago.

34:27.596 --> 34:29.228
Brick's on the street?

34:29.231 --> 34:30.848
Womack forced my hand.

34:30.850 --> 34:34.016
He'll be able to ID Darren to Andre.

34:34.018 --> 34:35.601
All the more reason
why you need to get

34:35.603 --> 34:36.937
that kid off the street now.

34:36.938 --> 34:38.071
Don't worry--

34:38.072 --> 34:41.108
I'll get you the gun,
along with the kid.

34:43.527 --> 34:45.946
- Darren.
- What's going on?

34:50.168 --> 34:51.385
[Sighs]

34:51.387 --> 34:52.835
Carter...

34:52.838 --> 34:55.038
You're gonna say,
"I told you so."

35:03.762 --> 35:05.480
Finch, Darren's run off,

35:05.482 --> 35:07.148
probably to go
after Brick again.

35:07.150 --> 35:10.569
And this time he's got the gun
they used to kill his brother.

35:10.571 --> 35:13.371
In other words, the idea of
letting a 14-year-old hire you

35:13.373 --> 35:15.457
to avenge his brother
has backfired?

35:15.459 --> 35:16.658
You can lecture me later.

35:16.660 --> 35:18.610
Right now I need you
to bring me the bag.

35:18.612 --> 35:19.878
Which bag?

35:19.880 --> 35:21.796
The one labeled "plan 'B'".

35:23.165 --> 35:25.116
Hey.
You need backup?

35:25.118 --> 35:26.468
I don't know.
Do I?

35:26.470 --> 35:27.836
I figured it might've had
something to do

35:27.838 --> 35:29.921
with that fish the captain
had you throw back in the sea.

35:29.923 --> 35:31.473
It might.

35:31.475 --> 35:32.924
I got a tip.

35:32.926 --> 35:35.644
You want to go fishing?

35:36.646 --> 35:38.813
Yeah, sure, why not?

35:41.517 --> 35:44.736
[Both speaking indistinctly]

36:00.653 --> 36:03.455
That's the kid?

36:03.457 --> 36:05.123
Darren, right?

36:05.125 --> 36:06.508
Yeah, I recognize you.

36:06.510 --> 36:10.345
We got something to talk about,
right, you and me?

36:13.349 --> 36:15.216
Wow.

36:21.674 --> 36:24.008
Darren's in there.

36:24.010 --> 36:25.677
Relax, Finch.

36:25.679 --> 36:28.563
It's bean-bag rounds,
riot ammo.

36:28.565 --> 36:31.282
I told the kid no killing.

36:31.284 --> 36:32.867
On my signal,

36:32.869 --> 36:36.020
you're gonna cut the power
to the building.

36:36.855 --> 36:39.524
That was the signal, Finch.

36:39.526 --> 36:40.542
It's pretty brave of you

36:40.544 --> 36:42.377
coming in here
like that, Darren.

36:42.379 --> 36:44.546
I get it.

36:44.548 --> 36:45.580
I do.

36:45.582 --> 36:47.532
My man took someone from you,

36:47.534 --> 36:50.552
so you're here
to take him from me.

36:50.554 --> 36:52.504
So go ahead and shoot him.

36:52.506 --> 36:55.039
I mean, he's the one that
screwed up in the first place,

36:55.041 --> 36:56.758
even put us in this situation.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.093
So you're doing me
a favor here.

36:58.095 --> 37:00.378
- Yo, Andre--
- Shut your mouth.

37:01.931 --> 37:04.315
I see you got it in you.

37:04.317 --> 37:06.518
Yeah, you got that conviction.

37:06.520 --> 37:11.439
It's a hard quality
to find around here.

37:11.441 --> 37:14.359
So you go ahead
and pull that trigger.

37:16.078 --> 37:19.030
You should come work for me.

37:19.032 --> 37:21.950
You're young enough,
by the time you Brick's age,

37:21.952 --> 37:23.835
you'll be running these streets
for me, son.

37:23.837 --> 37:25.453
Ain't nobody gonna touch you.

37:25.455 --> 37:26.504
You know why?

37:26.506 --> 37:29.924
Because you smarter
than the rest.

37:29.926 --> 37:32.427
Now, you made it
all the way here.

37:32.429 --> 37:34.012
Go ahead...

37:34.014 --> 37:36.047
And claim that reward.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.189
Claim it.

37:44.191 --> 37:47.258
Man, come on, come on.

37:49.645 --> 37:51.613
Yeah, I thought
that might happen.

37:53.149 --> 37:55.617
I don't blame you.
I blame the store.

37:55.619 --> 38:00.271
Kids spending their days
reading these revenge stories,

38:00.273 --> 38:02.457
selling it like it's reality.

38:02.459 --> 38:05.660
But you know the thing
about comic books?

38:05.662 --> 38:07.712
They're just comics.

38:10.082 --> 38:12.300
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that?

38:15.721 --> 38:17.505
Move!

38:17.923 --> 38:19.507
[Gunshot]

38:22.428 --> 38:25.180
Go around back.

38:27.233 --> 38:29.801
NYPD, drop your weapon.

38:32.971 --> 38:34.989
Aah! Aah!

38:34.991 --> 38:36.658
Get down, kid!

38:47.620 --> 38:49.987
Fusco!

38:51.841 --> 38:53.341
Fusco, you okay?

38:53.343 --> 38:55.927
- Yeah, just peachy.
- Come here.

38:58.097 --> 39:01.349
[Indistinct chatter
over police radio]

39:07.640 --> 39:08.690
You know what?

39:08.692 --> 39:10.475
Whatever you got to say,
save it.

39:10.477 --> 39:12.861
I can already see the ass cake
on my desk when I get back.

39:12.863 --> 39:14.512
No, man, actually,

39:14.514 --> 39:16.531
I just wanted to say thank you

39:16.533 --> 39:19.234
for saving my life.

39:19.236 --> 39:21.736
You're welcome, kid.

39:21.738 --> 39:23.855
Come on. Let's go.
Get me out of here.

39:23.857 --> 39:26.791
[Groans]
Hey, take it easy, will you?

39:32.030 --> 39:34.549
Just when I thought
you were sticking around.

39:34.551 --> 39:36.751
Manhattan, you know...

39:36.753 --> 39:38.169
Got a little claustrophobic.

39:38.171 --> 39:39.871
And a job's come up in Sudan.

39:39.873 --> 39:42.924
I'll be sorry
to lose you again.

39:44.426 --> 39:46.177
That woman--
I've forgotten her name.

39:46.179 --> 39:48.563
Did she tell you
what you wanted to know?

39:48.565 --> 39:51.182
Alicia Corwin--
She told me some stuff.

39:51.184 --> 39:53.434
I don't know
if it's what I wanted to know.

39:53.436 --> 39:55.052
You know, I had my dad
on a pedestal.

39:55.054 --> 39:58.857
Loved him, hated him,
but just always admired him.

39:58.859 --> 40:01.025
It's kind of hard to believe
he was just an ordinary guy,

40:01.027 --> 40:03.027
made mistakes
like everybody else.

40:03.029 --> 40:05.029
Well, whatever she told you,

40:05.031 --> 40:06.915
there's one thing
you should know about him.

40:06.917 --> 40:08.950
Anytime anyone ever asked him

40:08.952 --> 40:11.402
what his proudest
achievement was,

40:11.404 --> 40:14.238
he always said that it was you.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.741
Thank you.

40:20.078 --> 40:23.715
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.

40:29.438 --> 40:30.755
You know, Fusco tells me

40:30.757 --> 40:34.108
they got a lead
on a foster family.

40:34.110 --> 40:35.560
I had a family.

40:35.562 --> 40:40.281
Darren, we don't get to choose
what happens to us...

40:40.283 --> 40:41.766
Just what we do about it.

40:41.768 --> 40:43.651
I looked into them.

40:43.653 --> 40:45.820
They're good people.

40:45.822 --> 40:47.789
And if they aren't?

40:47.791 --> 40:51.159
I'll take care of it.

40:52.461 --> 40:55.847
I'm, uh, still on the clock.

40:58.617 --> 41:01.002
I'm still working on it,

41:01.004 --> 41:02.420
but here...

41:02.422 --> 41:03.788
This is yours.

41:03.790 --> 41:06.791
Would you look at that?

41:06.793 --> 41:10.127
I always wanted a sidekick.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.147
Thanks.

41:13.149 --> 41:16.467
Which, uh, reminds me...

41:16.469 --> 41:18.569
I pulled some strings.

41:18.571 --> 41:21.155
You'll be starting
at that charter school

41:21.157 --> 41:22.991
for the arts.

41:22.993 --> 41:24.475
My trumpet.

41:24.477 --> 41:26.577
They got drawing classes too.

41:26.579 --> 41:27.946
Is that right?

41:27.948 --> 41:30.498
Remember, opportunities
multiply as they're seized.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.417
Sun Tzu...

41:32.419 --> 41:33.534
Right.

41:33.536 --> 41:36.421
Hey, don't worry, man.

41:36.423 --> 41:39.991
Someday you'll find a home too.

41:42.928 --> 41:45.430
Thanks.
[Knock on window]

41:45.432 --> 41:47.465
Come on, kid,
they're waiting for you inside.

41:47.467 --> 41:49.517
All right, man.

41:50.803 --> 41:52.103
What's up, Fusco?

41:52.105 --> 41:54.772
Hey, man, I think
you're gonna need a bullet

41:54.774 --> 41:57.108
in that other cheek
to even out that limp.

41:57.110 --> 41:59.143
Good to see you too.

42:02.982 --> 42:05.283
Hi.

42:05.285 --> 42:07.452
Come on.

42:13.692 --> 42:15.376
He's a good kid.

42:15.378 --> 42:17.078
Think he'll be all right?

42:17.080 --> 42:18.496
He's a tough kid.

42:18.498 --> 42:20.999
It's a good thing
we showed up in time, you know.

42:21.001 --> 42:22.500
You're cutting it awfully close
with Carter.

42:22.502 --> 42:24.535
She's still looking for you,
last I checked.

42:24.537 --> 42:27.972
Like I said,
you let me worry about Carter.

42:27.974 --> 42:29.891
Any news on that other thing?

42:29.893 --> 42:31.375
Yeah.

42:31.377 --> 42:32.477
He's got so many aliases,

42:32.479 --> 42:34.812
I don't even know
where to start.

42:34.814 --> 42:37.065
Oldest one I could find
is a Harold Wren.

42:37.067 --> 42:39.183
He's an underwriter
for an insurance company

42:39.185 --> 42:40.351
for a number of years.

42:40.353 --> 42:43.354
Before that, MIT student,
top of his class.

42:43.356 --> 42:45.073
It was there
where he met the kid's dad--

42:45.075 --> 42:46.858
You know, Nathan Ingram.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.443
He's that billionaire
that got killed

42:48.445 --> 42:49.560
a couple years back.

42:49.562 --> 42:51.112
Ingram...

42:51.114 --> 42:53.448
Graduated from the
same class as Wren.

42:53.450 --> 42:55.900
Yeah, except I did
a little more digging.

42:55.902 --> 42:58.453
Wren was the name he used
freshman year at MIT.

42:58.455 --> 43:01.906
That name doesn't appear
on any records before '76,

43:01.908 --> 43:04.175
which tells me that Wren
was a false identity too.

43:04.177 --> 43:06.377
This guy spent so much time
being someone else,

43:06.379 --> 43:09.347
he probably doesn't know
who he is anymore.

43:09.349 --> 43:12.083
"Only the paranoid survive."

43:12.085 --> 43:14.085
You know, Lionel...

43:14.087 --> 43:18.222
You could have been a good cop
if not for a few bad choices.

43:18.224 --> 43:19.974
You got me snooping
around your boss,

43:19.976 --> 43:22.610
but I make bad choices?

43:22.612 --> 43:25.146
Man has a point.
