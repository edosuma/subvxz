WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.671
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.129 --> 00:05.255
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.464 --> 00:09.059
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.432
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.678 --> 00:13.897
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:14.097 --> 00:15.849
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:18.147
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.775
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:22.273
Previously on Arrow...

00:22.481 --> 00:24.859
Before he was taken,
Cayden was working on a biometric tracker

00:25.067 --> 00:26.910
that could recognize a heartbeat,
anywhere in the world.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.077
Anywhere Adrian Chase is.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.531
You're gonna help me free Cayden
from where A.R.G.U.S. is holding him.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.116
We can think of another way to find him.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.576
This is our only chance.

00:33.909 --> 00:34.910
Don't do this.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.042
Helix is about to extract Cayden James.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.669
<i>You're holding someone
with no lawyer, no trial.</i>

00:39.873 --> 00:44.003
The woman I love could never do this.
Lyla, this job has changed you.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.178
You didn't back my play.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.802
All of the times that I supported you,
you couldn't do the same for me.

00:48.006 --> 00:48.973
What's that?

00:49.174 --> 00:51.051
- Tracker's honing in on Chase's location.
- Where is he?

00:52.386 --> 00:53.387
He's here.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.121
Felicity?

01:18.036 --> 01:20.755
No, Felicity. Hey.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.082
Chase. He's here.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.418
Don't move.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.424
That's not gonna be a problem.

02:06.918 --> 02:10.092
All right. If Chase is here,
he's not on this level.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.309
It felt like an explosion,
but there was minimal damage.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.018
Il' was an <i>EMF'.</i>

02:16.595 --> 02:18.142
A burst of electromagnetic radiation.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.066
Everything in the bunker
with an electric circuit has been fried.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.483
How do you know?

02:22.809 --> 02:26.313
Because the spinal implant
that helps me walk isn't working.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.987
I can't feel my legs.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.792
You know, under different circumstances
these chemlights might seem festive.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.998
No sign of Chase.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.293
Looks like the EMP was his play.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.007
Elevator and security doors offline.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.806
- You check the emergency exit door?
- I did. It's welded shut.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.724
If Chase wasn't so evil,
I might actually be impressed.

02:55.926 --> 02:56.973
The air vents are gonna be down, too...

02:57.177 --> 02:59.350
The air vents will last
a little while longer, but...

03:01.348 --> 03:03.021
Yeah, we have to get a message out.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.648
Other than standing at the door
and yelling really loudly,

03:05.852 --> 03:07.695
I don't really know what our options are.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.564
We're trapped.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.109
Do you ever feel like we're trapped?

03:13.568 --> 03:14.911
- What do you mean?
- Like, we're trapped

03:15.112 --> 03:16.364
in this vicious cycle.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.823
I mean, you put an arrow
in one crime lord,

03:18.031 --> 03:19.533
- and another just, like...
- ...pops up...

03:19.741 --> 03:22.164
Well, a lot of people are trying to fill
the vacuum left by Damien Darhk.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.168
Yeah. This week's winner is Werner Zytle.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.669
- Do you have a location on him?
- Not yet,

03:26.873 --> 03:28.045
but Curtis is working on fixing a 20.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.675
Sounds like you don't even need me.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.837
Have you seen Curtis try to throw a punch?

03:32.045 --> 03:35.219
I mean, we don't need you,
we need 10 of you.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.350
Nice try...

03:37.551 --> 03:40.851
If we had more boots on the ground
or masks on faces, or whatever,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.853
we might actually have a real possibility
at catching one of these guys

03:44.057 --> 03:45.980
that is auditioning to be
the new Damien Darhk.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.186
I don't have the bandwidth

03:48.395 --> 03:51.820
or, more importantly,
the temperament to train a new team.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.822
Besides you're trying
to fix something that's working.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.574
We are a good team.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.202
Yeah, we are and we always have been.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.371
Yeah.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.953
Oh, my God. That's a nasty cut.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.540
Oh. Well, it's not gonna scar
but I was thinking maybe...

04:07.748 --> 04:09.716
Getting some Kevlar sleeves?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.297
You know me too well.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.718
<i>“Ma?”</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:19.926
Hi, Curtis.

04:20.177 --> 04:23.226
Palmer Tech has been working on
an advanced thermal imaging prototype,

04:23.430 --> 04:26.559
which I borrowed, tweaked,
and developed to find...

04:27.142 --> 04:28.143
<i>Boom.</i>

04:28.602 --> 04:29.774
- Bad guy on a yacht.
- Dang.

04:29.978 --> 04:30.945
Thank you for the assist.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.898
See? Help is good.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.365
I will contact you when I'm on-site.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.581
Call me back, will you?
Better yet, just show up.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.251
Things are going
all kinds of hell around here.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.002
Still no luck?

04:46.203 --> 04:47.546
No.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.173
It's like Oliver's
dropped off the face of the Earth. Again.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.586
How's it going over here?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.092
Well, every defense attorney in town

04:56.296 --> 04:59.766
just found out that the DA
is a serial killer, so not good.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.809
You think the court's gonna
overturn Chase's convictions?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.889
If I didn't, I wouldn't have convened
this war room.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.724
It'd be sure nice to have
a mayor heading it up, though.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.606
- You heard from Felicity?
- Radio silence.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.936
- But I got Curtis.
- And?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.817
He's gonna check and see
if Oliver's at the bunker.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.068
Get on it.

05:15.982 --> 05:16.949
<i>You find Oliver yet?</i>

05:17.150 --> 05:20.245
Hey, Rene. You do realize
that you called me,

05:20.445 --> 05:22.789
literally 15 minutes ago, right?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.991
Blame it on Lance.
Guy gets freaky when he's worried.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.454
Yeah, well. Lucky for you, I can run fast.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.500
<i>- Weird.
- What's weird?</i>

05:34.459 --> 05:37.338
No power. Whole place.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.640
What are the chances that
Oliver forgot to pay his electric bill?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.969
Infinitesimal, considering I rigged
the place so that it'd be off the grid...

05:43.176 --> 05:46.180
And a bomb just went off.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.355
<i>Not funny.</i>

05:47.556 --> 05:51.106
I'm not kidding.
I heard some kind of explosion.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.524
How many is that?

05:57.732 --> 06:00.201
Eleven. Hasn't made a dent yet.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.494
What's that thing made of anyway?

06:01.695 --> 06:04.539
Keltium. It's a proprietary alloy

06:04.739 --> 06:07.868
developed by the US Government
to repel nuclear blasts.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.295
So, you're saying even if we had
a nuke down here, it wouldn't work?

06:10.579 --> 06:11.751
Seems like Cisco did such a good job

06:11.955 --> 06:13.548
of turning this place
into an impenetrable fortress,

06:13.748 --> 06:15.125
he turned it
into an impenetrable deathtrap.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.552
Chase doesn't want to kill me, remember?

06:17.752 --> 06:19.220
Yeah, he just locked you down here
for the fun of it.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.139
He locked us down here

06:21.339 --> 06:23.592
because he is up to something up there...

06:25.010 --> 06:26.182
And I can't do anything about it.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.104
Well, the good news is
there's not much left for him to do.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.724
I mean, he's already gone after
Curtis, Lance, Evelyn, even Susan,

06:30.932 --> 06:33.151
and Thea's away and Lyla and J.J.
have A.R.G.U.S. protection.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.352
I mean, who's left?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.648
William.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.905
William's in a different town, with
a different name and a different address.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.827
I'd be surprised
if Chase even knows about William.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.623
When he was holding me captive...

06:48.408 --> 06:49.660
He showed me a picture of him.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.078
What?

06:51.953 --> 06:53.796
- Does he...
- Doesn't know where he is.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.457
Yet.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.091
We have to get out of here.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.669
Cisco's original blueprints
are in that cabinet.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.937
If you're just gonna stand there,
you might as well say something.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.519
I thought you were sleeping.

07:18.647 --> 07:19.694
I couldn't sleep.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.987
I know you're upset.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.612
I know you think that I violated
some kind of trust between us, but...

07:24.819 --> 07:25.820
Lyla...

07:27.447 --> 07:29.620
When you said that
you wouldn't become like Amanda Waller,

07:29.824 --> 07:30.825
I was worried about you.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.331
I'm fine.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.291
You're the one who seems to have a problem

07:34.496 --> 07:35.668
with the way
that I've been running A.R.G.U.S.

07:37.040 --> 07:41.386
Which is particularly interesting to me
since neither one of us has a job

07:41.628 --> 07:44.381
that fits
the conventional definition of morality.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.548
What's that supposed to mean?

07:45.799 --> 07:48.643
You're upset because A.R.G.U.S.
is locking people up without due process

07:48.843 --> 07:51.392
when you and Oliver and your team
of masked recruits

07:51.638 --> 07:53.891
has been playing judge and jury
for years now.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.856
Lyla, I can't believe you actually
compared Team Arrow

07:57.060 --> 08:00.155
to this clandestine
government super-agency.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.073
Well, I just did!

08:07.529 --> 08:08.576
<i>Hello?</i>

08:09.990 --> 08:12.038
<i>Diggle family? Anybody home?</i>

08:14.661 --> 08:16.083
I definitely heard Lyla yell.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.581
Knock... Knock again.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.879
Didn't know we were having a party.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.505
I'm sensing a lot of marital tension...

08:24.713 --> 08:26.260
- What do you guys want?
- So sorry to interrupt.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.507
There's a problem at the bunker.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.687
I can get us out of here
by climbing up the elevator shaft.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.104
If you can think about
going up the elevator,

08:34.264 --> 08:35.390
Chase has already
thought of a way to stop you.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.599
So you're saying it's booby-trapped.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.518
I'd bet my copious Palmer Tech
severance pay on it.

08:38.727 --> 08:39.774
I'm saying I can handle it.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.398
Or we figure out a new plan.
Like, getting a signal out to the team.

08:42.772 --> 08:43.739
You just said that everything

08:43.940 --> 08:45.237
with an electrical circuit down here
has been fried.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.035
Only because I haven't figured out
how to get power yet.

08:47.235 --> 08:51.035
So, figure out how to get power,
and I will go up the elevator shaft.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.116
Seriously? Are you still
not listening to me?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.709
Did the EMP give you short-term amnesia

08:54.909 --> 08:57.037
about what we were arguing about
down here in the first place?

08:57.245 --> 08:58.963
This feels like the best choice right now.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.922
Besides the one I just gave you.

09:57.013 --> 10:00.187
I told you so. I told you so.
I told you so.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.650
How many times do you think that is?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.524
I was not keeping count.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.531
Eleven, I think. But not nearly enough.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.983
You ready?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.829
Because your operating theater is now lit.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.618
And of all the things that we need to do

10:14.823 --> 10:16.496
to get ourselves out
of this hermetically sealed bunker,

10:16.699 --> 10:19.953
stitching up a wound from a fall that
I totally predicted isn't one of them.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.788
I think that counts as 12.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.543
I... Okay, I'm ready.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.173
- That hurt?
- Yes. Yes, it did.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.553
I won't say, "Good."
But let the record show I was tempted.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.557
Do you remember what we were discussing
before we got EMP-blasted?

10:36.719 --> 10:37.720
Mmm-hmm.

10:38.388 --> 10:42.643
The fact that I back your play,
even when I don't agree,

10:43.977 --> 10:45.854
but you don't have
the same consideration for me.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.991
You didn't listen to me
when I wanted to join Helix...

10:50.191 --> 10:51.488
With good reason.

10:52.569 --> 10:57.075
I could say the same thing about you
a million times over, but I support you.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.326
Because I trust you.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.832
Felicity, I trust you.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.253
Really?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.707
There's a hole in your back
that says otherwise.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.258
Fair enough.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.382
Is that the painkillers talking?

11:14.591 --> 11:18.266
If you have a plan
that will get us out of here, fantastic.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.767
Let's finish this up and let's try it.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.564
Okay.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.021
What's an EDM?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.446
Something you might hear at a nightclub.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.199
This was an EMP.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.902
Actually, fun fact, the previous lair
used to be underneath the nightclub.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.453
- Curtis...
- Right. Sorry.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.114
And you said Felicity's down there, too.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.912
According to the last position
logged by her tracking nanites.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.455
What do we need to get them out?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.250
Rappelling gear, acetylene torches,

11:44.454 --> 11:47.799
wideband active field probes,
tungsten carbide drill bits.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.051
I can cobble together
most of those things but...

11:50.251 --> 11:52.094
Text me a list of whatever you need,

11:52.295 --> 11:53.638
A.R.G.U.S. is at your disposal.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.632
- Great.
- If that's okay with you.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.974
I hate to ask this, but how much air
do they have left down there?

12:04.140 --> 12:07.144
Well, if they don't exert themselves,

12:07.393 --> 12:09.942
five, maybe six hours.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.155
Okay. Well, we're here. Now what?

12:15.401 --> 12:17.074
The mainframe
has a built in cellular chip,

12:17.278 --> 12:20.157
but our rewire didn't generate
enough kilowatts to jumpstart it.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.325
Right. Because everything
with an electronic circuit is fried.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.244
Everything with an electronic circuit...

12:24.452 --> 12:25.829
My old bike?

12:26.955 --> 12:29.299
She's a beaut.
Good old-fashioned combustion engine.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.298
So we can generate electricity
without an electronic starter.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.504
- Oh, yeah.
- That is smart.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.349
SCPD is happy
to have Zytle off the streets.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.761
Or, more appropriately, off the docks.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.767
- Great. So, mission accomplished.
- Yeah.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.689
- What's next for my favorite power couple?
- Power couple?

12:44.931 --> 12:45.853
Yeah.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.193
I thought that you and Oliver...
You guys aren't hooking up again?

12:48.351 --> 12:50.695
Oh, no. No. God, no.
Why would you even think that?

12:50.937 --> 12:52.189
Well, because every time I come by

12:52.355 --> 12:54.699
you guys are in the middle of
exchanging longing looks for each other.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.109
No, we're not.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.532
- Oh, Felicity.
- We look nothing like that. I don't know...

12:58.778 --> 13:00.200
"I wish I didn't
break up with him.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.497
What? What?

13:01.698 --> 13:03.166
- "You know, we were so happy together..."
- Were?

13:03.366 --> 13:05.118
- Yeah.
- Past tense. Yes.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.795
Look, I know that he hurt you by
not telling you about his son, but...

13:07.996 --> 13:10.294
Look, it's not just about William.
It's about what William represents.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.045
Oliver having sex with another woman.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.007
No, but thank you for that visual.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.015
William is symptomatic of a larger problem
between Oliver and I.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.216
That being?

13:20.717 --> 13:22.139
Oliver doesn't trust me.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.729
Right, your man who has put his life
in your hands a couple thousand times.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.396
Trusting me as Overwatch is one thing,

13:29.642 --> 13:32.361
but we're talking about his son,
Curtis, his child.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.069
Oliver doesn't trust me enough
to share important information

13:36.316 --> 13:38.489
and crucial information with me.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.328
What's the point
of being in a relationship at all?

13:41.529 --> 13:45.204
I'm not gonna say that
Oliver Queen plays great with others.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.375
But?

13:46.576 --> 13:48.044
But he can still
change that about himself.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.209
You know what he can't change?

13:51.706 --> 13:52.753
What?

13:53.041 --> 13:54.338
That way he looks at you.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.346
You both owe it
to each other to see, Felicity.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.886
- Tonight.
- Tonight? No. Why tonight?

14:01.591 --> 14:03.264
- Well...
- Don't say...

14:03.551 --> 14:04.598
Curtis.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.430
Next time...

14:08.598 --> 14:09.895
Pick up your own Chinese food.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.442
Um, you know, I just thought
we'd all be hungry

14:11.601 --> 14:13.945
- from the crime-fighting.
- Yeah.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.400
Oh!

14:15.605 --> 14:17.699
Oh, man! I...

14:17.899 --> 14:18.946
You know, I just remembered.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.412
I have a date night with Paul, my husband.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.956
I have a date with my husband,
so I have to go to that.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.414
You guys enjoy that though.
You enjoy that.

14:30.328 --> 14:34.128
Also, there is
wine in the garage, so... Bye.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.842
What?

14:37.919 --> 14:39.091
I'll get the wine.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.593
Okay, gentlemen. Eyes are up.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.270
Gotta say, this team is never boring.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.312
Didn't think I'd be doing this
when I woke up this morning.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.524
Oliver and Felicity might suffocate.
How can you be so glib?

14:55.770 --> 14:56.692
You've met me, right?

14:56.938 --> 15:00.112
And how come your toy balls
can't float down here and do this for us?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.944
For the thousandth time, Rene,
they're called T-Spheres.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.122
But if you want,
call them by their proper name.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.831
You named them?

15:07.990 --> 15:09.162
Kodo and Podo.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.663
You know Dar's thieving little ferrets
on <i>The Beastmaster.</i>

15:12.829 --> 15:14.001
Let's just say, uh...

15:14.288 --> 15:17.132
A young Marc Singer was quite helpful
in me discovering my homosexuality.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.176
<i>And my heterosexuality.</i>

15:20.294 --> 15:21.841
You're on an open channel, by the way.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.005
Open line...

15:23.297 --> 15:25.550
Well, look, I can't get my T-Spheres
because they are in the bunker

15:25.800 --> 15:28.474
and, therefore, fried. So, whatever.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.516
I swear those two are going to make
the cutest couple one day.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.311
John?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.693
- John?
- Yeah.

15:40.523 --> 15:44.198
Anything in particular you're looking for
with that 1,000-yard stare?

15:47.363 --> 15:48.740
It's that obvious, huh?

15:49.657 --> 15:52.752
Rene wasn't the only one who could
clock tension between you and the missus,

15:52.994 --> 15:53.995
if that's what you mean.

15:54.912 --> 15:55.913
Right.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.422
Let me guess.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.345
You confronted Lyla

16:03.546 --> 16:06.675
about the A.R.G.U.S. black site
and it didn't go too good.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.597
Something like that.

16:08.843 --> 16:09.844
You wanna talk about it?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.053
Not really.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.930
Okay.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.895
Well, if you did...

16:16.350 --> 16:18.023
I'd tell you about Vinnie and me.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.070
Vinnie?

16:20.271 --> 16:22.694
My undercover partner.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.743
On and off the job.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.533
Working UC, we had to keep
certain things from each other.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.787
And we didn't do it because we wanted to.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.922
We did it because we had to.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.628
Okay.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.639
It took some horse-trading
but I got everything Curtis asked for.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.595
- Great.
- What's the status here?

16:48.883 --> 16:50.476
He and Rene are getting a lay of the land.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.887
Kodo and Podo. Any updates?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.268
No good ones.
The EMP fried the hydraulics system.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.401
We have to out through the magnetic seal
in order to reach the manual override.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.775
- We'll need the acetylene torch.
- And the wideband active field probe.

17:01.938 --> 17:02.939
Without my T-Spheres,

17:03.105 --> 17:04.948
there's no telling
what's on the other side of this thing

17:05.107 --> 17:06.108
after the EMP blast.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.492
- Is it working?
- Give it a second.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.916
Thanks again, for trying things my way.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.469
A first time for everything.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.846
Regarding Helix...

17:32.969 --> 17:34.971
You know why I didn't back your play

17:35.179 --> 17:39.935
and you know, or you should, that it had
nothing to do with a lack of trust.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.519
If you're going to start saying,

17:41.769 --> 17:45.490
yet again, that it's because
you don't want me to be like you,

17:45.690 --> 17:47.112
you can hold your breath.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.535
Particularly since
we are running out of oxygen.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.954
Cayden James is a criminal.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.952
Cayden James is a hacker.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.330
As in, so much less worse than the Bratva.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.334
I made the exact same trade-off
you did to get Chase.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.505
I picked the lesser of two evils.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.128
The fact that I didn't want you to do that

18:03.332 --> 18:05.130
- doesn't make me a hypocrite.
- What does it make you, then?

18:05.334 --> 18:09.305
It makes me someone
who doesn't want you to be like me.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.845
Yeah.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.521
Barn! That's what I'm talking about.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.693
- You okay?
- Yeah, depending on what that sound is.

18:26.689 --> 18:27.736
That's not good.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.199
One of the pipes is damaged.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.903
I just hope it's not the highly toxic
and flammable gas pipe...

18:35.698 --> 18:37.575
So much for doing things my way.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.668
Careful. Don't breathe.
Well, breathe but don't inhale.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.389
- Done.
- You okay?

18:52.590 --> 18:54.843
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm a little...

18:56.177 --> 18:57.520
A little light-headed.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.056
Hold on.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.224
How much more duct tape do we have?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.232
That's the last of it.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.365
Um, we have the epoxy spray
that Cisco gave us to fix our suits.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.537
If it's upstairs,
then that's definitely flooded by now.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.864
How much time do we have?

19:17.073 --> 19:19.075
Twenty minutes. Max. Before we asphyxiate.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.250
Good times, right?

19:20.451 --> 19:22.374
Oliver, we've already gone over that.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.545
It's just full of dead ends,

19:23.746 --> 19:26.249
which is an unfortunate
but accurate choice of words.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.752
- Wait a second.
- Yeah, we can wait.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.257
We only have 20 minutes, but we can wait.

19:30.461 --> 19:33.214
There's a steam tunnel underneath
this part of the bunker.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.812
Do we have anything to pry this open?

19:41.055 --> 19:42.102
I don't know. It doesn't look pry-able.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.058
Felicity, this is it.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.987
Okay. This could be the fumes talking
but I think I have a slightly insane idea.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.401
How insane is "slightly insane"?

19:49.730 --> 19:50.777
Well, that depends on how you feel

19:50.981 --> 19:53.951
about setting off an explosive arrow
in a room full of flammable gas?

19:57.113 --> 19:58.285
Careful, Rene.

19:58.781 --> 19:59.953
That seal is pure titanium.

20:00.157 --> 20:03.661
It has a melting point of between 1,600
and 1,700 degrees Celsius.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.293
Just let me do my thing, hoss.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.512
That's weird.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.972
No, no, no, Rene, stop!

20:26.809 --> 20:29.153
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow!

20:29.478 --> 20:30.695
I'm gonna need you
to stop making that noise.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.282
I'm sorry my agonizing pain
is bothering you.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.989
I mean, thank you very much
for helping me with this.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.031
These are
just second degree burns, Curtis.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.875
You should be just fine
in a couple of weeks.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.331
Do we know what caused the explosion?

20:44.535 --> 20:47.163
High levels of methane. Am I the only one
that thinks this is Prometheus?

20:47.329 --> 20:50.503
No. But we need to find a way of saving
our friends without blowing them up.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.798
- What about acid?
- No.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.504
- No, I don't think that would...
- Wait, wait, wait.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.964
You said the hatch was titanium, right?

20:57.214 --> 20:58.306
Yeah.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.843
Hydrochloric acid
will turn it into Swiss cheese.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.145
I used to work undercover
with a gang of safe crackers.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.688
That's good. Let's get cooking.

21:13.564 --> 21:14.565
Careful!

21:14.815 --> 21:16.988
If the powder is one gram under,
the grating won't blow.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.160
What if it's one gram over?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.987
Well, it'll increase the breaching radius,

21:20.196 --> 21:21.994
igniting the gas,
filling this entire place with fire...

21:22.198 --> 21:24.041
It'll kill us both,
is what you're gonna say, right?

21:24.408 --> 21:25.751
Yeah.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.540
No pressure. Careful.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.704
Yup.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.540
- Wait.
- What?

21:30.915 --> 21:33.009
My math is probably right,
but what if it's wrong?

21:33.209 --> 21:34.677
Are you still Felicity Smoak?

21:34.877 --> 21:35.844
Yeah.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.388
Your math is always right.

21:37.588 --> 21:38.840
Right.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.269
Okay, um, the arrow needs to go in
at exactly a 45-degree angle.

21:43.594 --> 21:44.720
Okay.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.601
By exactly, do you mean exactly?

21:46.806 --> 21:49.150
Well, one centimeter off
and the blast will force the grate off,

21:49.391 --> 21:50.608
igniting the gas and...

21:52.436 --> 21:53.437
Please don't miss.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.616
You didn't miss.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.462
Looks like about a two-story drop.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.755
Drop?

22:11.914 --> 22:13.131
I'll get the climbing gear.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.805
Remind me again, why I thought
this was gonna be a fun idea?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.097
I don't know.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.843
Hop down. Hop down. Hop down. Excuse me.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.094
OW...

22:25.511 --> 22:27.513
Right. Okay, so...

22:28.430 --> 22:29.852
- This is just a chin-up.
- Okay.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.100
Everybody knows a chin-up.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.275
- Well...
- All right?

22:32.476 --> 22:35.525
It's a chin-up with a flourish at the end.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.609
Yeah.

22:40.818 --> 22:41.990
I can't do a chin-up.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.035
- Come here.
- Okay. Um...

22:46.949 --> 22:48.371
I don't flourish well.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.619
- I believe in you. Ready?
- Oh. Whoa!

22:50.953 --> 22:53.331
Oh, my God. Hey! I'm chinning and upping.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.212
- Okay. Kind of.
- Whoo!

22:55.499 --> 22:56.466
- Ow.
- Okay.

22:56.667 --> 22:57.668
- Yeah.
- All right.

22:57.877 --> 22:58.969
- Okay. Mmm-hmm.
- You ready?

22:59.169 --> 23:00.887
- One... Two, three.
- Yeah.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.635
- Go!
- No, no, no.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.471
- Help. Help. It's too high.
- Yep. All right. I got you.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.227
- Good. Higher than it was before.
- I got you.

23:10.973 --> 23:11.974
Um...

23:12.641 --> 23:13.813
Yeah. I kind of did it.

23:14.018 --> 23:14.985
- I think.
- Sure.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.233
There was the chin-up part,
I think we could work on.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.401
You did a half of one.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.069
Half. I'll take the half.
It's exhilarating.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.659
I don't think that's really my...

23:23.319 --> 23:25.321
In fairness,
you've had a little bit to drink.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.488
Yeah...

23:27.656 --> 23:29.158
I've had a lot to drink.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.062
You should just... Thank you.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.628
What happened? Did the acid work?

24:21.877 --> 24:24.300
Yeah. It's just, it's gonna take
10 seasons of The Bachelor

24:24.546 --> 24:26.389
before it melts those hinges down.

24:26.799 --> 24:27.925
What? I don't judge your DVR.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.385
Okay, how much time do they have left?

24:29.760 --> 24:30.807
Ten minutes, give or take.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.555
Yeah. Somebody better order up a miracle.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.890
I don't know if this counts
but it could help.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.782
Where the hell did you get this?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.237
A.R.G.U.S. likes to keep tabs
on interesting tech.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.241
You copied my T-Sphere?

24:52.408 --> 24:54.251
No, we improved them.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.287
No. You're both wrong.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.586
Lyla, if you stole this,

24:59.915 --> 25:01.838
what other surprises
can I be expecting from you?

25:08.340 --> 25:11.344
It's okay. Just hang on. Hang on tight.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.436
- Not that tight. Not that tight.
- Sorry.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.313
That's okay.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.691
- Almost there.
- Okay.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.818
I got you. I got you.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.479
- Okay.
- All right.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.361
- Right here.
- Yeah, I know.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.191
Thanks.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.324
Are you okay?

25:30.612 --> 25:32.785
- Hey. We made it. We made it.
- Yeah. I'm fine.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.704
Yeah.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.050
It's another dead end.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.680
Okay, stop using that term.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.934
We bought ourselves some time
away from the gas, at least.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.137
Hey. Oliver?

25:56.055 --> 25:57.056
Oliver?

25:58.015 --> 25:59.813
Oliver? Oliver?

26:04.855 --> 26:07.654
Oliver? Oliver? Oliver?

26:07.900 --> 26:10.153
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.612
You gotta stay awake, okay?

26:11.820 --> 26:13.242
I think I'm losing a lot of blood.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.165
Tell me something I don't know.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.375
I'm so sorry.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.541
Normally I would relish
an Oliver Queen apology,

26:19.745 --> 26:21.292
but this sudden admission
is making me nervous.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.465
You were right. I didn't have your back.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.134
But it wasn't because I didn't want you
to end up like me, Felicity.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.427
It was much more than that.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.973
Okay. Lots of blood loss with
exposure to toxic gas makes you go crazy.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.891
- Now we know that.
- I need you to hear this.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.807
- I will. Later. Right...
- Might not have a later.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.058
Do not talk like that.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.264
I need you to know the truth.

26:40.474 --> 26:41.521
About what?

26:42.643 --> 26:44.316
I didn't have your back.

26:45.604 --> 26:51.031
It was not because of you
or a lack of trust, it was because of me.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.369
It was because of me.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.948
I'm not the man you think I am.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.079
I'm not the man you fell in love with.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.706
I put the hood on
to right my father's wrongs.

27:02.454 --> 27:06.175
But the basis of it, the foundation of it

27:06.375 --> 27:11.051
and what you did and what Digg did
and what the team did in my name...

27:12.631 --> 27:14.099
It was all based on a lie.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.471
What are you talking about?

27:15.676 --> 27:18.555
Chase, he showed me
when he held me hostage,

27:19.471 --> 27:22.190
that I didn't do what I did to be a hero.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.813
I did what I did...

27:26.812 --> 27:30.908
Because there was a part of me,
a bigger part than I would like to admit.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.494
I enjoyed it.

27:36.113 --> 27:37.410
I enjoyed killing.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.581
It's not about not trusting you.

27:42.578 --> 27:43.795
I will always trust you.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.626
I don't trust myself.

27:48.876 --> 27:49.923
Oliver?

27:50.919 --> 27:52.762
Oliver, don't... Oliver?

27:53.297 --> 27:54.799
Oliver. Hey.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.967
Hey! Oliver, come back!

27:57.593 --> 27:59.061
Come back. Oliver!

27:59.344 --> 28:00.345
Come back.

28:08.061 --> 28:11.065
Just promise me you're not gonna
tell anyone that we had bunker sex.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.192
And by anyone, I mean Curtis.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.986
Because he'd never look at me the same.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.621
Are you sure?

28:17.905 --> 28:20.533
Because he had me pick up Chinese food
and then he suggested wine.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.790
I'm pretty sure
that he was rooting for exactly this.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.421
So...

28:27.456 --> 28:30.130
Maybe he saw something that we didn't see.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.514
I think Curtis watches
too many rom-coms with Paul.

28:44.306 --> 28:45.432
You Okay?

28:46.058 --> 28:47.401
Yeah. I'm fine.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.478
It's just...

28:51.980 --> 28:53.323
Talk to me. What's going on?

28:53.982 --> 28:57.236
This was nice. You know?
It was really nice. It just...

28:59.655 --> 29:01.657
It doesn't change things between us.

29:01.865 --> 29:02.957
We still have our problems.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.001
It's because we never talked
about our problems.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.245
We never talked about William.

29:06.453 --> 29:10.503
Even if there was no William,
there still wouldn't be an "us."

29:13.210 --> 29:14.678
Because you don't trust me.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.511
I was hoping that you'd change.

29:22.344 --> 29:23.641
But you don't trust anyone.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.390
And I don't know why.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.527
You know, maybe if I knew why
things would be different.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.610
I don't even think you know why.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.659
I love you.

29:39.528 --> 29:42.998
But that is why I can't settle
for anything less than your full trust.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.347
I know I should be mad that
you stole my tech

29:59.548 --> 30:02.347
but the modification designs
you guys put on here are ridonculous.

30:02.551 --> 30:03.768
Hey. How about less geeking out

30:03.969 --> 30:06.643
and more figuring out how to use
that thing to get to Felicity and Oliver?

30:07.055 --> 30:08.557
They ran out of time 10 minutes ago.

30:13.854 --> 30:14.855
What is this?

30:15.314 --> 30:16.406
It's an audit

30:17.316 --> 30:20.240
of every black op I've signed off on
as Director of A.R.G.U.S.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.408
Why are you giving me this?

30:22.738 --> 30:25.241
I don't want there to be
any more secrets between us, John.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.868
But there is one thing
I need to know from you.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.043
Name it.

30:29.244 --> 30:34.171
No matter what Oliver Queen does,
no matter how morally compromising,

30:34.583 --> 30:37.257
- you stand behind him no matter what.
- Lyla.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.926
Why can't you do that for me?

30:44.885 --> 30:46.637
Well, I guess I never really
thought of it like that.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.188
Well, maybe you should start.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.187
Because I'm not Oliver, Johnnie.

30:52.142 --> 30:53.143
I'm your wife.

30:53.602 --> 30:57.903
And even though I disagree with many
of your choices, I trusted those choices.

30:59.608 --> 31:00.905
I trusted you.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.117
I think I deserve the same consideration.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.619
I figured it out!

31:07.115 --> 31:08.867
Oh, sorry. Were you guys
in the middle of something?

31:09.076 --> 31:10.749
It looks like you were
probably in the middle of something.

31:10.952 --> 31:14.081
But I did figure it out.
So, let's chop, chop, chop.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.666
It's okay, Curtis.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.292
We're fine.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.383
Let's go get Oliver
and Felicity out of there.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.222
Oliver?

31:26.468 --> 31:28.391
Oliver? Damn it. Wake up.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.642
- Hey!
- Hey.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.433
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God. You're okay.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.359
I think the wound re-clotted.

31:37.771 --> 31:39.239
Careful. Hey.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.698
Felicity, I don't...

31:45.195 --> 31:47.289
I don't know
that I can get us out of here.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.366
Well, it'll give us some time
to talk about something.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.838
Like this crazy idea
that you enjoy killing.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.506
It's why you disbanded the team, isn't it?

32:01.670 --> 32:02.671
Yeah.

32:03.213 --> 32:06.137
Oliver, you said that I don't know
the kind of man that you are.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.679
I wouldn't have fallen in love with you,
or wanted to marry you

32:09.886 --> 32:12.105
if I didn't know
exactly the kind of man that you are.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.976
Chase tortured you for a week.

32:17.561 --> 32:20.030
You're the toughest person I know
but anyone,

32:20.230 --> 32:21.197
anyone would have admitted

32:21.398 --> 32:23.526
to being a tap-dancing flamingo
after what he put you through.

32:25.735 --> 32:29.490
Adrian Chase didn't make me a killer.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.707
No. Five years in hell did that.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.377
Five years dealing
with this city's worst did that.

32:34.578 --> 32:38.253
You've spent a decade dealing with horrors
that most people don't even realize exist.

32:38.457 --> 32:39.959
And the fact that,
that didn't turn you into a monster

32:40.167 --> 32:42.966
proves exactly the kind of person
that you are.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.511
I don't know what kind of person I am.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.319
<i>- Curtis?
- Not just Curtis.</i>

32:59.519 --> 33:00.520
Are you guys Okay?

33:00.729 --> 33:02.731
<i>Oliver is a little hurt.
We could use your help.</i>

33:02.939 --> 33:04.782
About that. We got a new problem.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.829
The bunker's generators
have a doomsday scenario fail-safe.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.121
Assuming a catastrophic attack,

33:10.322 --> 33:13.417
they're tamper-proof so no one
can stop them from turning back on.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.244
<i>Wait, why would you want to stop them?</i>

33:15.452 --> 33:17.454
<i>The methane.
The power coming back on will spark it.</i>

33:17.662 --> 33:21.087
If we don't get the air-vents
back online first somehow...

33:21.291 --> 33:25.467
You guys are sitting
underneath a four-story bomb.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.929
How long do we have
before the generator kicks back on?

33:34.221 --> 33:36.189
<i>And blow you up?
Twelve minutes. But don't worry.</i>

33:36.389 --> 33:37.356
Too late.

33:37.557 --> 33:38.774
<i>We have a plan.</i>

33:39.935 --> 33:40.936
Careful.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.604
We gotta be getting close.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.784
Think we're there, D.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.702
<i>Talk to me, Curtis.</i>

33:58.036 --> 34:00.789
I'm trying to hack the city grid to
re-route power to the ventilation system.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.129
Can you blow the gas
before the generators come back online?

34:03.291 --> 34:04.292
Well, we'll know if we hear

34:04.543 --> 34:06.261
an earth-shattering ka-boom
beneath our feet.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.300
- Slow down. Slow down.
- We don't have time to slow down.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.467
And we don't have time
for you to bleed to death, either.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.639
It's a good point. It's good. It's...

34:16.888 --> 34:19.983
Oliver! Oh, my God. Oliver?

34:20.891 --> 34:22.313
Oliver? Oliver?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.984
Hey, Curtis!
Oliver's down, we need your help!

34:25.647 --> 34:26.648
Oliver.

34:27.649 --> 34:28.821
Hang on. Coming to you.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.953
This looks like
the Death Star interrogation droid.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.004
I loaded it with 20 CC's of adrenaline.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.464
You're gonna have to inject that into...

34:44.248 --> 34:45.922
Whoa.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.589
- I'm okay!
- You're nowhere close.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.969
But we gave you enough adrenaline
to get us out of here.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.844
Good.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.812
Okay. All right.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.139
Okay. Yeah.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.147
Are you really gonna climb down there?

35:04.185 --> 35:05.858
Somebody has to meet them halfway.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.367
Nice jump, Digg-

35:12.527 --> 35:13.619
John!

35:14.029 --> 35:15.030
Are you okay?

35:16.031 --> 35:17.032
I'm good.

35:17.699 --> 35:18.791
We are running out of time.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.539
I've almost got
the ventilation systems back up.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.502
Oliver!

35:25.332 --> 35:26.333
<i>Oliver!</i>

35:26.875 --> 35:27.876
- Yeah!
- Hey!

35:28.043 --> 35:29.044
Hey, you guys all right?

35:29.210 --> 35:30.211
No, not really.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.549
John!

35:35.342 --> 35:36.309
You Okay?

35:36.509 --> 35:37.635
Stay there. We'll figure something out.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.061
John, we don't have time.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.518
Look, do you have enough cable
to meet us halfway?

35:41.723 --> 35:42.815
- Yes.
- That's optimistic.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.393
We only have 30 feet.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.645
It's not helping. Throw him the line.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.742
This is crazy.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.077
You don't hear me arguing, do you?

35:55.320 --> 35:56.742
All right. Hang on, tight.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.749
I always appreciated you
doing the salmon ladder,

36:03.995 --> 36:05.872
but never as much as in this moment.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.006
It's all right. It's all right.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.058
I've got about five feet of slack.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.853
- I can make it.
- Oliver, if you don't...

36:20.428 --> 36:21.429
I will.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.448
You have to let me go.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.703
You have to let me go! You have to go!

36:42.534 --> 36:43.751
Curtis, cut the vents!

36:43.952 --> 36:45.295
- Now he tells me?
- Do it!

36:47.914 --> 36:48.961
Sorry, Felicity.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.102
I know you hate it
when I don't listen to you.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.474
Rene, pull us up.

37:15.775 --> 37:16.901
Hey, Lyla.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.823
Thanks for letting us come here.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.160
See? A.R.G.U.S.
isn't always used for evil.

37:25.326 --> 37:26.669
I know. You're right.

37:26.911 --> 37:29.664
I should have trusted you. I do trust you.

37:30.957 --> 37:34.006
We just work
in morally gray areas, Lyla, and I...

37:34.294 --> 37:36.046
I let that cloud my perspective a bit.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.304
Or a lot.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.677
Or a lot.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.351
I'm sorry.

37:44.137 --> 37:46.014
I promise, we will get through this.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.698
Hey. Any word on Oliver?

37:55.982 --> 37:57.199
Lyla's checking now.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.027
Gotta say, it's good to see you up
and walking again.

37:59.235 --> 38:01.078
Yeah. Thank Curtis.
He's the miracle worker.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.824
It's just a temporary fix. I have to run
a more comprehensive diagnostics.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.205
You guys are gonna have to explain to me
how all this works one day.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.870
You really don't want him to do that.
Nerd-a-palooza.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.539
Oliver just got out of surgery.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.925
- He's going to be fine.
- Can we see him?

38:14.167 --> 38:15.840
Actually, he asked to see you.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.213
Ooh!

38:19.672 --> 38:21.049
We were all thinking it.

38:27.764 --> 38:31.394
Would it help if I didn't ask for lessons
on a particular piece of equipment?

38:33.895 --> 38:36.523
I know you're probably a little upset
about what I said last night still...

38:36.731 --> 38:38.199
I'm not mad.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.907
- You were right.
- So were you.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.707
You know, we never really did talk about
anything and...

38:48.910 --> 38:49.911
I walked.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.626
That was wrong.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.250
I'm sorry.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.420
Thank you.

39:02.757 --> 39:06.307
I'm not saying never about the talk.

39:06.636 --> 39:07.762
I just...

39:09.055 --> 39:10.432
Maybe not quite yet.

39:12.642 --> 39:13.985
I'm not ready yet.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.105
I'm not going anywhere.

39:18.773 --> 39:19.945
Okay.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.796
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

39:36.791 --> 39:39.135
- You're walking.
- I am.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.468
More importantly, you're living.
You really gave us a scare back there.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.975
Well, I'd figured you'd be used to seeing
me close to death by now.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.429
Never gonna get used to it. Ever.

39:50.847 --> 39:52.975
But, speaking of being close to death,

39:55.935 --> 39:57.858
I said a few things back there.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.859
I really, really appreciate what you said.

40:03.610 --> 40:04.827
Any of it stick?

40:05.653 --> 40:06.779
Hopefully.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.624
I'm sorry.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.829
- For what?
- For being a hypocrite.

40:14.495 --> 40:17.669
You were right.
I was starting to become like you.

40:17.874 --> 40:21.674
And not in the heroic, you know,
honorable, muscular way.

40:21.878 --> 40:26.634
It's just, after I lost Billy,
I was willing to do whatever to get Chase.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.682
It drove me to work with Helix
and I was willing to break any rule,

40:29.844 --> 40:32.688
do anything to get payback and,

40:33.389 --> 40:35.812
you know, what I'm trying to say is

40:36.017 --> 40:38.566
I think I got the tiniest taste
of what you've been through.

40:39.729 --> 40:42.858
Tiniest, and I get it now.

40:47.153 --> 40:52.159
I understand
why you lied to me about William.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.918
Why you had to.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.416
I get it.

40:57.413 --> 41:01.759
And for the extent that I judged you
and I did judge you, lam sorry.

41:05.213 --> 41:08.183
You know, you said you didn't know
what kind of person you are.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.773
I think you should figure that out.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.497
William.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.169
My name is Matthew.

41:42.417 --> 41:43.634
But it used to be William, right?

41:43.835 --> 41:45.633
Before you and your mom left Central City?

41:46.295 --> 41:47.592
You know my mom?

41:47.797 --> 41:49.799
Actually, I knew your father.

41:51.259 --> 41:52.852
And he knew mine.
