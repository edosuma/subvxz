You've made it to the second

You'll have two hours

17:43.771 --> 17:46.816
After this round, your blades

17:46.816 --> 17:49.485

in a sheet metal throw,

17:49.485 --> 17:51.279

17:51.279 --> 17:54.323

Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your two hours starts...

that didn't make

18:01.539 --> 18:02.790

and that's Burton.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.542
How does he fix that problem?

18:04.542 --> 18:06.252
‐ You're gonna have to take
the oxy‐acetylene torch

18:06.252 --> 18:08.879
and you heat the edge and just
cap it with a cross peen

18:08.879 --> 18:10.381
and stretch it out.
He's only gotta go by

18:10.381 --> 18:11.841
1/8 of an inch.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.593
‐ No, I need a rag.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.012
To get the extra 1/8th inch
on the width of that,

18:16.012 --> 18:18.848
get the oxyacetylene torch
and just heat it up

18:18.848 --> 18:21.809
about an inch
forward of the transition there

18:21.809 --> 18:24.979
and just widen it out
with the hammer.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.773
‐ Burton has heated up
the base of that blade.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.525
What does that do
to his temper?

18:29.525 --> 18:31.110
‐ You don't need to worry about
losing the temper

18:31.110 --> 18:32.528
on the edge of these knives,

18:32.528 --> 18:33.654
we're not cutting anything
with them,

18:33.654 --> 18:35.531
so you can hammer that out,

18:35.531 --> 18:37.116
and you'll be fine.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.826
‐ I've gotta thin
these things out,

18:38.826 --> 18:41.412

18:41.412 --> 18:43.831
<i>I have to hog off</i>
<i>a lot of steel</i>

18:43.831 --> 18:46.417
<i>because these things weigh,</i>
<i>like, a pound a piece.</i>

18:46.417 --> 18:49.462
There's definitely
a fine balance where you want

18:49.462 --> 18:52.465
something with some heft to it,
but you also want something

18:52.465 --> 18:54.634
that's not meant to smash
through a cinderblock wall.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.553
[laughs]

18:57.553 --> 18:59.347
But the weight
is not the end all.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.349
<i>I have to make these</i>
<i>tapered correctly,</i>

19:01.349 --> 19:03.225
and I have to make them
balance correctly.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.019
<i>So I'm going to grind them all</i>
<i>the same way,</i>

19:05.019 --> 19:07.104
<i>therefore the mass should be</i>
<i>distributed the same way</i>

19:07.104 --> 19:08.648
across all three knives.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.149
‐ Mike went to the scale,

19:10.149 --> 19:12.401
wrote down on each one
what they weighed.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.654
‐ If you've got a set,
they should weigh the same

19:14.654 --> 19:16.405
and balance pretty much
at the same point.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.240

in weights, variance in sizes,

19:18.240 --> 19:19.742

<i>going to be different,</i>

19:19.742 --> 19:21.243

19:21.243 --> 19:22.953
<i>so it has to be pretty close</i>

19:22.953 --> 19:25.247

19:25.247 --> 19:28.376
