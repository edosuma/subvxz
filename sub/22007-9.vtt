WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.213
I'm not going to wrestle over
this.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.114
I am standing there with the
idol in my little pink shorts,

00:13.147 --> 00:18.986
and pandemonium is ensuing in
front of me.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.088
JEFF: While a strong
alliance of seven was calling

00:20.121 --> 00:23.991
the shots.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.526
And Mike was desperate to join
them.

00:25.559 --> 00:29.397
This could be my moment to
get off the bottom.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.565
JEFF: At trike, accusations
were made.

00:31.599 --> 00:35.136
There's one person running
the game right now, and that's

00:35.169 --> 00:36.270
Ben.

00:36.304 --> 00:41.008
Our alliance, we sit like the
knights of a roundtable.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.976
JEFF: Orders were followed.

00:43.010 --> 00:47.281
And Lauren saved her vote for a
future tribal council by using

00:47.315 --> 00:49.717
her secret advantage.

00:49.750 --> 00:54.021
In the end, Desi became the
first member of the jury.

00:54.054 --> 00:58.092
Desi, the tribe has spoken.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.260
10 are left.

00:59.293 --> 01:07.168
Who will be voted out tonight?

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.150 --> 01:26.687
My tribal council experience
was, again, me not knowing who's

01:26.720 --> 01:27.855
going home.

01:27.888 --> 01:32.660
I voted for the person I was
supposed to vote for, but Desi

01:32.693 --> 01:37.165
went home, and I'm not happy
about because it looks like

01:37.198 --> 01:40.067
they're trying to stay together
and vote off the healers.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.269
Oh, that's pretty.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.838
So at this point, I need to
throw the other healers under

01:44.872 --> 01:48.742
the bus, and suddenly... not even
so suddenly... throwing names out

01:48.776 --> 01:51.579
there, it could mean I'm here
for a few more days.

01:51.612 --> 01:58.586
The healers fell apart when we
had the yawa, and Cole started

01:58.619 --> 02:01.789
telling Jesse secrets and then
started stealing peanut butter.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.790
Are you kidding me?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.392
What a guy, huh?

02:04.425 --> 02:07.428
At that point, the healers
were done.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.564
I have an idol but I don't want
to play it so I'm throwing names

02:10.598 --> 02:13.567
out there right now, knowing
that Joe and Cole are so hated

02:13.601 --> 02:16.604
on this tribe, that they're
going to be one of the two

02:16.637 --> 02:18.272
people to go next.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.139
Good morning, Chrissy.

02:19.173 --> 02:19.673
Good morning.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.842
How are you today?

02:21.875 --> 02:23.110
I'm happy every day.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.312
It's a new day.

02:24.345 --> 02:28.081
I have the secret advantage
and I played it and I think I

02:28.115 --> 02:29.149
played it very well.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.251
Nobody caught on to it.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.552
I got away with it.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.922
My secret advantage is in play,
which is super exciting for me

02:34.955 --> 02:36.156
because now I have two votes.

02:36.190 --> 02:40.861
How freaking lucky are we?

02:40.894 --> 02:43.564
You ain't told nobody I have
it, have you?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.432
No.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.468
Because I pulled that off
really good.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.303
I'm not turning my back on you.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.838
I hope you don't, either.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.072
No.

02:52.105 --> 02:57.345
When it gets down to seven it
will be a hard decision me and

02:57.378 --> 02:58.246
you.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.447
We will talk about it when we
get there.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.149
At this point right now the
only person who bees about the

03:02.182 --> 03:03.351
secret advantage is Ben.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.687
And so far, he's not let me
down, and I've not let him down,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.623
and keeping him involved in it
keeps us, two, together.

03:09.657 --> 03:13.093
It couldn't have worked out
any better.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.362
We're good with the sieve?

03:14.395 --> 03:16.096
We're solid, final seven.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.132
The only thing I'm worried about
is we're going to be screwed

03:19.166 --> 03:19.900
once we get there.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.670
I don't think we'll be
screwed.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.405
You don't think so?

03:24.438 --> 03:25.138
No.

03:25.172 --> 03:25.739
You know why?

03:25.773 --> 03:27.107
Why.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.843
Because I have an idol in my
pants.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.378
Shut up!

03:30.411 --> 03:32.546
I found it before.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.549
I'm really proud of myself so
far because I found the idol

03:35.583 --> 03:36.317
underneath the flag.

03:36.350 --> 03:36.784
It's mine.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.918
It's in my pocket.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.621
It will be in my pants going to
tribal council.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.722
How did you get it?

03:41.755 --> 03:44.525
Chrissy saw the plate and
then I saw the plate, too.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.095
Usually if somebody has an idol,
you keep your cards close to

03:48.128 --> 03:53.367
your vest, but Devin really
trusts me, so I had to tell my

03:53.401 --> 03:53.701
boy Devon.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.603
No one.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.169
I know.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.371
That's never leaking.

03:57.405 --> 04:01.642
I know that Devon will never
tell anybody that I have an

04:01.675 --> 04:02.109
immunity idol.

04:02.142 --> 04:02.810
Thank you, man.

04:02.843 --> 04:03.844
I appreciate that.

04:03.877 --> 04:08.749
I'm making him dependent on
me a little bit, and

04:08.782 --> 04:10.318
thatdependency is carrying me
into the end.

04:10.351 --> 04:15.155
I think this is going to be
the best team "survivor" has

04:15.188 --> 04:15.656
ever seen.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.925
We're a good duo.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.128
And nobody even knows.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.263
JEFF: All right, you guysread
challenge.

04:56.296 --> 04:56.564
Yeah!

04:56.597 --> 04:57.765
Yes.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.233
JEFF: For today's
challenge, you'll be divided

05:00.267 --> 05:01.502
into two teams.

05:01.535 --> 05:05.873
On my "go" you'll swim out to a
tall ladder, climb that ladder,

05:05.906 --> 05:09.577
leap off the ladder, and
retrieve a key underwater.

05:09.610 --> 05:13.213
Once you have three keys, you'll
open a chest and use the balls

05:13.246 --> 05:16.717
inside to score five baskets.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.852
First team to finish wins
reward.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.287
Want to know what you're playing
for.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.124
JEFF: The winning five will
be taken on to a luxury yacht.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.325
Okay.

05:25.359 --> 05:31.599
Why you will tour the fujiian
islands, dine on sandwiches,

05:31.632 --> 05:34.502
cold beer, red wine, and
chocolate cake.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.936
Wait, wait, wait.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.137
What's the catch, Jeff?

05:37.170 --> 05:40.541
JEFF: The catch is, losers
will go back to camp for more

05:40.574 --> 05:40.941
coconut and rice.

05:40.974 --> 05:41.609
All right.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.543
JEFF: Worth playing for?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.111
Yes!

05:44.144 --> 05:46.780
JEFF: All right, we'll
divide into teams and get

05:46.814 --> 05:47.214
started.

05:47.247 --> 05:51.619
Let's do a draw.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.986
All right, here we go.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.055
We have our two teams.

05:55.088 --> 06:00.027
For blue it is Ben, Devon, and
Ashley in the water, along with

06:00.060 --> 06:01.294
Ryan and Lauren.

06:01.328 --> 06:08.902
For red, it is Cole, Chrissy, jp
in the water, along with Joe and

06:08.936 --> 06:09.470
Dr. Mike.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.238
Here we go, for reward.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.173
Survivors ready?

06:13.206 --> 06:13.974
Go!

06:14.007 --> 06:16.109
Come oguys, come on!

06:16.143 --> 06:18.679
JEFF: It is Ben and Chrissy
in the water.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.980
Let's go, Chrissy!

06:20.013 --> 06:23.684
JEFF: Former tribemates on
the heroes.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.818
Good job.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.555
JEFF: Ben first to the
platform, making it look easy.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.321
Chrissy right on his tail.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.623
Good job, girl!

06:29.657 --> 06:30.558
Keep it up.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.325
JEFF: It is a big jump from
a tall ladder.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.394
There you go, come opush it!

06:34.428 --> 06:35.162
Come on.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.331
All right, Chrissy!

06:38.365 --> 06:39.700
Good job!

06:39.733 --> 06:42.169
JEFF: Nice execution.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.172
Next job is you've got to
release that first bowie with

06:45.205 --> 06:45.973
the key.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.443
Chrissy goes down first.

06:49.477 --> 06:53.914
There goes Ben.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.749
Ben comes up empty-handed.

06:55.783 --> 06:59.119
Come on, Ben!

06:59.152 --> 07:01.689
JEFF: Chrissy has hers for
red!

07:01.722 --> 07:03.891
It is now Chrissy in the lead.

07:03.924 --> 07:09.029
Ben still working on that bowie.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.864
Now he's got it!

07:10.898 --> 07:13.166
That a boy, Ben.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.802
JEFF: Great effort by
Chrissy.

07:14.835 --> 07:19.807
Got to get all the way up here
and get that buoy in the bin.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.341
Go, red!

07:21.374 --> 07:21.642
Go!

07:21.675 --> 07:22.810
Whoa!

07:22.843 --> 07:25.045
>>
JEFF: It is now Cole in the

07:25.078 --> 07:25.513
water.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.647
Let's go, Cole!

07:26.680 --> 07:28.816
JEFF: Cole is ripping
through the water for red.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.318
Ben lost a lot of time in that
first round.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.786
You're almost there!

07:32.820 --> 07:33.654
You got this.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.823
JEFF: Cole races up the
ladder.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.290
Cole jumps.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.860
Here comes Ben.

07:39.893 --> 07:40.961
Go, blue!

07:40.994 --> 07:43.196
It is now Ashley in the water.

07:43.230 --> 07:49.970
This is what she does for a
living, and you can see it.

07:50.003 --> 07:55.776
Ashley quickly to the platform.

07:55.809 --> 08:03.483
Cole up with the second key, but
Ashley is on his tail.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.185
Go, Ashley, go!

08:05.218 --> 08:07.454
JEFF: Ashley making up a
lot of time right now.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.156
Let's go, Cole!

08:09.189 --> 08:10.323
Get up there!

08:10.357 --> 08:13.460
JEFF: Cole it back.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.227
Go!

08:14.261 --> 08:16.897
That's two for red, blue with
one.

08:16.930 --> 08:21.068
You killed that.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.369
Good job!

08:22.402 --> 08:26.506
JEFF: Ashley up with the
second buoy and second key for

08:26.540 --> 08:26.974
blue.

08:27.007 --> 08:27.908
Come on, guys.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.309
JEFF: Get it in the bin.

08:29.342 --> 08:29.910
Go, blue!

08:29.943 --> 08:33.179
Come on, Dev.

08:33.212 --> 08:39.251
JEFF: It is Devon in the
water now here comes jp.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.889
Jp does not even come up for
air.

08:41.922 --> 08:47.961
He jumpedaur the ladder and has
stayed under water.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.197
This would be a hero move.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.566
And he's got it!

08:52.600 --> 08:55.535
Jp as fast as anybody in this
challenge.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.538
That was epic.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.673
Devon up the ladder?

08:59.707 --> 09:04.177
Devon now jumps.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.478
Jp very fast.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.647
Go red.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.448
Red doing a nice job in the
first stage of this challenge,

09:08.481 --> 09:09.950
and they have a nice lead.

09:09.983 --> 09:14.955
Joe and Dr. Mike working quickly
on the locks for red.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.190
Devon has the third key for
blue.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.558
Come on, Dev.

09:18.592 --> 09:19.793
We're still in it!

09:19.827 --> 09:21.695
We're still in it, buddy?

09:21.729 --> 09:23.897
Let's go!

09:23.931 --> 09:25.799
JEFF: Devon coming back
now.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.400
Gotta get it in that bin!

09:27.434 --> 09:29.502
It is now Ryan and Lauren
working on the locks.

09:29.536 --> 09:30.738
We got it.

09:30.771 --> 09:31.605
We got it!

09:31.639 --> 09:33.273
We got it, guys!

09:33.306 --> 09:34.174
Let's go!

09:34.207 --> 09:37.110
JEFF: Red has their chest
open now.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.712
Got to get all five balls in.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.013
Oh, wow.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.214
That's far.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.482
We've got it!

09:42.515 --> 09:43.250
We goff it!

09:43.283 --> 09:44.685
JEFF: They've got it open.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.452
Now you're in!

09:45.485 --> 09:47.020
Let's go, let's go!

09:47.054 --> 09:49.089
JEFF: Blue is back in this!

09:49.122 --> 09:52.125
Ben already shooting for blue
just misses.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.094
It is now Joe and Ben.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.396
Joe scores one for red!

09:56.429 --> 09:59.900
Joe looking for number two.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.669
Joe scores again for red!

10:01.702 --> 10:05.839
Let's go, baby!

10:05.873 --> 10:07.975
JEFF: Joe, that's three.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.843
He has been on fire!

10:09.877 --> 10:12.145
Joe looking for number 4 for
red.

10:12.179 --> 10:16.016
Just misses.

10:16.049 --> 10:20.353
Ben goes underhand and it works!

10:20.387 --> 10:21.855
Ben with two in a row underhand.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.424
Let's go, buddy, come on!

10:24.457 --> 10:26.326
Ben with number three!

10:26.359 --> 10:27.861
Suddenly we've got a challenge
now.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.730
It is three versus three.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.432
Ben is going granny style!

10:32.465 --> 10:34.902
Old-school midwest!

10:34.935 --> 10:36.336
We are tied.

10:36.369 --> 10:41.875
Huge reward on the line!

10:41.909 --> 10:43.711
Joe connects with number four!

10:43.744 --> 10:47.114
It is 4-3.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.148
Right here.

10:48.181 --> 10:52.652
JEFF: Joe looking for that
last basket.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.586
Joe scores for red!

10:53.620 --> 10:55.655
It is over!

10:55.689 --> 11:00.227
Big reward!

11:00.260 --> 11:04.364
Mike, Joe, jp, Chrissy, Cole...
Big win.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.700
We're going to bring one of our
boats in.

11:06.734 --> 11:10.037
They will take you to a luxury
yacht, where you will have a

11:10.070 --> 11:10.704
nice afternoon.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.005
Well earned.

11:12.039 --> 11:12.572
Enjoy.

11:12.605 --> 11:16.309
Let's bring in the boat.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.512
It's good to have a good meal
and, you know, just to get the

11:19.546 --> 11:23.216
extra energy and have an edge
when it comes to individual

11:23.250 --> 11:24.451
challenges.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.020
But, actually, this reward gives
me a window of opportunity to

11:27.054 --> 11:28.756
make moves and completely change
the game.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.892
JEFF: All right, Lauren,
Ashley, Devon, Ben, Ryan, got

11:31.925 --> 11:33.927
nothing for you.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.682
* *
I'm on top of the world.

11:55.715 --> 12:00.921
To get a huge meal on a
gorgeous yacht while cruising

12:00.954 --> 12:04.691
the Fijian islands is absolutely
priceless.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.826
Look at that dolphin!

12:05.859 --> 12:07.027
That was incredible!

12:07.060 --> 12:08.161
He, like, did the whole whoop
Dee do.

12:08.195 --> 12:11.064
Of course I would rather have
this reward with just my

12:11.098 --> 12:14.167
alliance, but even though I'm
not with my friends, I'm glad

12:14.201 --> 12:20.707
I'm here and can control the
conversation.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.441
Look at this!

12:21.474 --> 12:23.076
That's awesome!

12:23.110 --> 12:24.411
This is amazing!

12:24.444 --> 12:26.847
We've got bagels and roast
beef and cheese.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.048
I don't even know where to
start.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.517
I was so pumped to win this
reward, because I'm going to get

12:30.550 --> 12:33.153
some more food, and with
immunity right around the

12:33.186 --> 12:35.722
corner, I'm going to need as
much energy as I can just to

12:35.755 --> 12:36.924
oh, this is so good.

12:36.957 --> 12:40.928
I have only lost one challenge
my entire "survivor" career so

12:40.961 --> 12:44.331
far, and with a full belly, i
have a better chance than most

12:44.364 --> 12:46.099
to win the next immunity.

12:46.133 --> 12:50.737
We're going in, homey!

12:50.770 --> 12:53.807
It's definitely night noois
to be away from camp and have

12:53.841 --> 12:55.742
food and have the option to just
kind of hang out.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.479
But right now there's 10 players
and there's an alliance of

12:59.512 --> 13:00.380
seven.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.082
And you have three healers on
the bottom.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.918
So I have no control in this
game right now.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.888
I'm definitely in trouble, but
I've always been in trouble, and

13:07.921 --> 13:10.690
somehow, some way, I've stuck
around.

13:10.723 --> 13:11.859
Get it, bro.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.759
I'm not getting it.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.427
I'm seeing what's in the middle.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.263
He's looking for a clue.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.998
You have to give Joe props.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.266
He never stops.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.336
I play the game 24 hours a
day.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.672
The idol is underneath the boat!

13:25.705 --> 13:28.041
( LAUGHTER )
I came out here to play.

13:28.075 --> 13:28.741
I need to go.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.878
I like going 100 miles an hour.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.379
I don't like slowing down.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.746
I'm not going to give up.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.884
I've been an aggressive player
since day one.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.386
I'm going to continue to do
that.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.288
It will probably cost me the
game, but that's me.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.789
Life's pretty good, dude.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.691
Can't complain.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.993
There's the flag right there.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.060
Oh, yeah, there's the flag.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.130
You think they're all going
to come out?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.264
>>
( HORN BLOWING ).

13:51.298 --> 13:53.533
No!

13:53.566 --> 13:54.567
Is that them?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.436
Oh, my god!

13:56.469 --> 13:57.070
It's them!

13:57.104 --> 13:58.838
Oh, my god, it is!

13:58.872 --> 13:59.806
Come on!

13:59.839 --> 14:02.375
Don't even do it!

14:02.409 --> 14:05.578
Oh, here they come!

14:05.612 --> 14:06.679
Dev!

14:06.713 --> 14:09.883
One, two, three!

14:09.917 --> 14:16.523
( LAUGHTER )
That is so good!

14:16.556 --> 14:19.359
I wanted the experience of
being on the yacht, but at the

14:19.392 --> 14:21.461
end of the day, you've got to
move on.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.164
And I now have the opportunity
to talk to Ben because I'm

14:24.197 --> 14:27.867
trying to build as many
relationships and maximize my

14:27.901 --> 14:30.170
advantages that I have.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.540
As long as we stay seven
strong, this is not the

14:33.573 --> 14:34.574
worst-case scenario, right.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.577
You want to know what the
best-case scenario is?

14:37.610 --> 14:38.211
What.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.846
The idol is in my pants.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.748
You found it?

14:41.781 --> 14:42.049
Yes.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.183
Yes!

14:43.216 --> 14:43.816
Yes!

14:43.850 --> 14:45.552
Dude, no way, you found it!

14:45.585 --> 14:46.786
Oh, my god, okay!

14:46.819 --> 14:51.158
Truth is power in this game,
and I need to let people know

14:51.191 --> 14:53.226
I'm telling them the truth.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.096
Freaking Ryan has the idol.

14:56.129 --> 15:02.502
And I couldn't be more ecstatic
at this point because now I know

15:02.535 --> 15:03.736
Cole doesn't have it.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.006
Information is key in this game
so all this trust getting put

15:06.039 --> 15:08.541
into me is going to help me
later on in the game, too.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.411
And I'm not going to say
anything to anybody about this.

15:11.444 --> 15:15.215
But this proves that Ryan is out
here to play and win $1 million.

15:15.248 --> 15:19.119
So I'll just have to keep an eye
on that because right now this

15:19.152 --> 15:22.689
seven has to stick together
and you know you can trust me

15:22.722 --> 15:22.990
now.

15:23.023 --> 15:23.356
Yup.

15:23.390 --> 15:23.957
We're good.

15:23.991 --> 15:34.034
Yup.

15:34.034 --> 15:40.573
Yup.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.975
Right here.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.477
That thing is disgusting,
man.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.615
He's after something.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.283
I'll never give up.

15:50.317 --> 15:54.787
I usually find it when I want wh
i want to give up.

15:54.821 --> 15:55.622
I notice that.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.924
That's how it was for my second
idol.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.192
Right now, there's a group of
seven that are just running this

15:59.226 --> 16:03.930
game, and I'm definitely on the
chopping block.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.932
Not one person wants to make a
move.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.935
I've been digging for an idol
that probably is not there, but

16:08.968 --> 16:10.203
I'm not going to give up.

16:10.237 --> 16:14.741
One thing I do have is, you
know, people feel like I am, so

16:14.774 --> 16:17.644
I'm going to start pushing
buttons more and I'm going to

16:17.677 --> 16:21.514
get enough people so upset at me
that they're like, "yo, let's

16:21.548 --> 16:24.084
just keep this dude around
because we can get rid of him at

16:24.117 --> 16:26.153
any point," and at some point i
can make a move.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.121
Is Joe out there digging
again?

16:28.155 --> 16:28.421
Yes.

16:28.455 --> 16:28.855
Yes.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.590
Good for Joe.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.759
He's strangely entertaining.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.626
Right?

16:33.660 --> 16:36.029
Isn't he, like, strangely
entertaining?

16:36.063 --> 16:37.530
No.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.633
Like, I think there's game play
and there's just being...

16:40.667 --> 16:42.302
We can talk about it.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.672
The thing is that, like... we'll
talk about it later.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.241
Were you talking about me
we were.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.077
We were talking about you
digging down there.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.579
Don't stop talking about me
because I got here.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.347
You have to keep talking.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.349
We don't have to do anything,
Joe.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.550
We can do whatever we want.

16:57.584 --> 17:01.254
I know, but Mike knows the
relationship me and him have.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.489
He can continue talking.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.326
NEWS FLASH: Everyone talks
about people behind their backs.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.294
You should know that.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.595
It's the game, right?

17:08.627 --> 17:09.729
Ashley is getting feisty.

17:09.762 --> 17:10.963
I like it.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.165
Well, she needs to because...
I don't need to do anything

17:13.200 --> 17:14.334
you say I need to do.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.868
She's going to make it to the
final three being a goat.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.672
You can do your game, and we
all have respect for it, but you

17:19.705 --> 17:22.008
need to have the same respect
for everyone else.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.542
I'm having respect.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.244
And that's what I'm saying in
front of you.

17:25.278 --> 17:29.882
If I...
How is calling people a goat

17:29.916 --> 17:30.750
respectful.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.618
Oh, my god, you don't listen to
anyone.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.053
I would... I would use you as
a goat.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.755
You're, like, the ideal
definition of a goat.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.391
I'm so fed up with Joe's
mouth.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.626
I mean, yeah, it's all a game.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.462
But, yeah, you're dealing with
real individuals and real people

17:42.495 --> 17:43.230
with feelings.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.165
I'm just calling it how it
is.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.134
Just shut up!

17:47.167 --> 17:51.138
He's just such a bully, like a
bully on a playground, just

17:51.171 --> 17:54.874
trying to do whatever you can
and say whatever you can to get

17:54.907 --> 17:59.112
under chrissyy skin or my skin.

17:59.146 --> 18:03.316
I don't understand the pont
of saying something that like to

18:03.350 --> 18:04.151
another human being.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.419
I didn't come here for an
adventure.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.521
I didn't come here to make
friends.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.823
I didn't come here for any of
that.

18:10.857 --> 18:11.858
I just don't care.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.460
I don't want to be around you
anymore.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.863
I don't know what Joe's plan
it is because he has to know the

18:16.896 --> 18:20.233
more he pisses people off the
more they're going to want to

18:20.267 --> 18:21.701
get rid of him.

18:21.734 --> 18:26.105
I know that's what I will be
pitching at the next roundtable

18:26.139 --> 18:29.142
meeting that Joe needs to go
before Cole.

18:29.176 --> 18:29.742
Joe, shut up!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.093
* *
what!

18:47.126 --> 18:50.129
I'm aligned with Lauren, but
i am going to need to trust

18:50.163 --> 18:53.966
someone to come on board with
Lauren and I to help us because

18:54.000 --> 18:56.469
thinking more about the fact
that Ryan has an idol.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.105
I didn't realize... that's pretty
dangerous.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.941
So I'm confident in our final
seven, Ben.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.009
I think we're set.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.312
And that's...
So, we're good.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.313
I know.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.347
I'm stoked on that.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.583
But what's your... what's your
plan after, dude?

19:10.617 --> 19:13.420
Realistically, like, I want
to sit next to you.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.187
That would be rad.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.455
And that's...
Yeah?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.556
And that's no joke.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.925
I think we can do well
together.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.760
I think we will do well,
dude.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.297
I chose Devon because Devon's
just got a good soul.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.432
He really does.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.599
He's got a good heart.

19:26.633 --> 19:30.237
I want him to trust me, and i
want him for my side.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.573
You trust me in this game, we
will go far, because there are

19:33.606 --> 19:34.907
things that you're going to find
out.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.309
About?

19:36.343 --> 19:38.311
About everyone that is left
in the seven.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.113
Oh, like what do you mean,
like...

19:41.147 --> 19:42.382
Like secrets.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.883
This will either make us or
break us.

19:43.916 --> 19:44.817
Okay.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.586
I'm throwing my whole game
out right now.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.153
Okay.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.055
Because I trust you.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.022
Ryan has an idol.

19:50.056 --> 19:50.923
Really?

19:50.957 --> 19:51.224
Yes.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.158
Wow.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.826
And that's why I'm telling
you this now.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.861
Oh, my god.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.696
Because you have to trust at
least two people.

19:56.729 --> 19:57.297
Okay.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.565
And you I trust fully.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.165
Damn.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.268
Okay?

20:01.301 --> 20:01.934
Damn!

20:01.968 --> 20:04.471
I thought I trusted Ryan, man!

20:04.504 --> 20:08.408
This game just got real
complicated.

20:08.441 --> 20:12.011
Ryan's been contingent me that
I'm the only one that knows

20:12.044 --> 20:13.246
about this idol.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.115
Yet, he's going around to other
people telling them the exact

20:16.148 --> 20:17.417
same thing.

20:17.450 --> 20:17.917
He's good.

20:17.950 --> 20:18.951
He is good.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.521
He had me feeling like I was
his brother, man.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.457
We were in this game together
since day one.

20:24.491 --> 20:27.960
And I wanted to go to the final
three with Ryan, but I'm going

20:27.994 --> 20:29.262
to move on.

20:29.296 --> 20:34.367
I'm going to play this game with
Ben, and I'm going to have to

20:34.401 --> 20:36.002
make some big moves coming up.

20:36.035 --> 20:36.869
I'm locked in with you.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.438
Cool.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.406
This game just got fun.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.673
Wow!

20:40.707 --> 20:41.274
And real.

20:41.308 --> 20:46.012
Oh, my god!

20:52.852 --> 20:57.790
JEFF: Come on in, guys!

21:07.534 --> 21:11.904
JEFF: All right, you guys
ready for today's immunity

21:11.938 --> 21:12.572
challenge?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.106
Cole gotta take back necklace.

21:14.140 --> 21:19.245
Thank you.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.013
Hard to give it up.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.683
Once again, immunity is back up
for grabs.

21:23.716 --> 21:27.053
For today's challenge, you're
going to have bars resting on

21:27.086 --> 21:30.557
your shoulders, forcing you into
a very uncomfortable squatting

21:30.590 --> 21:32.559
position.

21:32.592 --> 21:37.063
If, in your attempt to find
relief, you go too low, your

21:37.096 --> 21:44.236
flag will pop, or too high, your
urn will drop.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.505
You're out of the challenge.

21:45.538 --> 21:49.442
Last person left squatting wins
immunity, safe from the vote.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.177
Losers, tribal council where
somebody will be the ninth

21:51.210 --> 21:54.246
person votedly out and the
second member of our jury.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.615
Take your spots.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.618
We'll get it on.

22:09.161 --> 22:14.567
JEFF: All right, everybody
take your spot on your box.

22:14.601 --> 22:18.505
You'll release your poles.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.472
Everybody is good.

22:19.506 --> 22:23.275
And this challenge is on.

22:23.309 --> 22:30.450
Another brand-new "survivor"
torture device that offers very

22:30.483 --> 22:31.618
little wiggle room.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.153
You go too low, you're in
trouble.

22:34.186 --> 22:39.258
If you stand too high, you're in
trouble.

22:39.291 --> 22:43.563
This one requires a little more
finesse.

22:43.596 --> 22:49.969
That urn, full of water,
hovering above your fire.

22:50.002 --> 22:54.641
Ashley is the first to drop and
sees how little wiggle room

22:54.674 --> 22:55.542
there is.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.810
You can have a spot over here on
the bench.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.311
Ashley is first out.

22:59.345 --> 23:03.082
And we are down to nine people
left in this challenge.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.519
And you're already in a very
uncomfortable position, even

23:06.553 --> 23:09.456
seconds into this challenge.

23:09.489 --> 23:13.660
Squatting is never fun.

23:13.693 --> 23:21.300
Dr. Mike drops, and we are down
to eight.

23:21.333 --> 23:25.738
Jp moving around a lot, feels
very comfortable.

23:25.772 --> 23:29.341
How far he can push it.

23:29.375 --> 23:33.613
Devon moving around.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.548
Joe with a little movement.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.349
Always moving, Jeff.

23:37.383 --> 23:40.720
Always moving.

23:40.753 --> 23:45.492
JEFF: Cole trying to find a
new spot.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.559
And there it is.

23:46.593 --> 23:49.562
Jp pushes too far.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.663
Jp is out of the challenge.

23:50.697 --> 23:56.503
We are down to seven.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.208
No way.

24:02.241 --> 24:05.512
JEFF: Devon looks down to
check out Chrissy's form, and

24:05.545 --> 24:08.781
Devon drops.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.817
Next to him, Joe drops.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.818
Joe is out.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.622
Devon is out.

24:15.655 --> 24:19.391
Ashley made one comment about
Chrissy's form, and it took out

24:19.425 --> 24:23.162
two guys within seconds.

24:23.195 --> 24:33.540
We are down to five.

24:33.573 --> 24:36.008
Just like that, Ben drops.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.476
Ben is out of the challenge.

24:37.510 --> 24:40.312
No shot at immunity.

24:40.346 --> 24:47.453
And we are left with four...
Chrissy, Cole, Lauren, and Ryan.

24:47.486 --> 24:52.291
You never know when it's your
day to step up with a million

24:52.324 --> 24:54.527
dollars on the line and an urn
full of water just waiting to

24:54.561 --> 24:58.230
put out your fire.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.431
Fire, symbolic of
what will happen tonight at

24:59.465 --> 25:00.299
tribal council.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.268
You're never certain at tribal,
ever.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.660
JEFF: Chrissy has not
changed her approach at all.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.830
Cole a little bit of bend,
trying to find some relief.

25:30.863 --> 25:31.798
Lauren looking straight down.

25:31.831 --> 25:35.835
And Ryan all alone on the end,
but still in it.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.436
How you doing, Ryan?

25:37.469 --> 25:40.439
I'm a survivor.

25:40.472 --> 25:41.073
I'm good.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.775
That a boy, Ryan.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.844
JEFF: That really does sum
it up.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.745
You're out here.

25:45.778 --> 25:53.720
That's most of it.

25:53.753 --> 25:54.954
Chrissy cannot take it anymore.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.689
You could see her face give out.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.190
Chrissy out of the challenge.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.060
And we are down to three.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.995
Oh!

26:03.029 --> 26:07.634
Cole, you look good.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.267
Everyone's doing good.

26:08.300 --> 26:17.143
You guys are doing great.

26:17.176 --> 26:20.479
JEFF: Ryan cannot hang
anymore.

26:20.512 --> 26:23.049
Ryan drops out of the challenge,
and we are down to two, and they

26:23.082 --> 26:29.021
are side by side... Cole and
Lauren in a showdown.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.824
Cole now with some movement.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.994
Your thing looks like it's
leaning a little bit.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.797
JEFF: Cole just gave up
that necklace, wants to put it

26:37.830 --> 26:42.935
back on as soon as possible.

26:42.969 --> 26:47.139
Cole dangerously close to that
low level but doesn't seem the

26:47.173 --> 26:50.142
least bit worried as he goes
right back up.

26:50.176 --> 26:59.218
Stretching it out.

26:59.251 --> 27:03.222
Lauren for the first time
showing some real movement.

27:03.255 --> 27:12.198
Don't go too high, Lauren.

27:12.231 --> 27:18.270
Lauren, you can't go any
higher, okay?

27:18.304 --> 27:21.708
JEFF: Rawren trying to
stretch out.

27:21.741 --> 27:31.784
Any kind of relief feels so
good!

27:31.784 --> 27:40.459
Any kind of relief feels so
good!

27:40.492 --> 27:41.327
Oh!

27:41.360 --> 27:43.529
JEFF: And out of nowhere,
Cole drops.

27:43.562 --> 27:44.396
He's out!

27:44.430 --> 27:47.299
Lauren wins individual immunity.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.001
That a girl!

27:49.035 --> 27:51.570
JEFF: Safe tonight at
tribal council.

27:51.603 --> 27:52.171
My back's killing me.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.005
JEFF: Great challenge!

27:53.039 --> 27:55.074
Good job, guys.

27:55.107 --> 28:00.880
Impressive.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.916
JEFF: Lauren, come on over.

28:03.950 --> 28:04.450
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

28:04.483 --> 28:07.486
That isa girl!

28:07.519 --> 28:08.955
JEFF: Lauren, individual
immunity is yours.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.957
You are safe tonight at tribal
council, cannot be voted out.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.992
Sadly for the rest of you,
somebody will be the ninth

28:13.025 --> 28:15.127
person voted out, second member
of our jury.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.328
It will not be you.

28:16.362 --> 28:16.929
Thanks.

28:16.963 --> 28:19.966
JEFF: Congrats.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.035
It's disappointing because i
know I had my chance to save

28:23.069 --> 28:25.371
myself today in eye challenge,
and I already have a target on

28:25.404 --> 28:26.538
my back.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.040
But they don't like Joe, so
hopefully they'll all take Joe

28:44.023 --> 28:48.795
* *
Lauren, great job.

28:48.828 --> 28:49.428
Thank you.

28:49.461 --> 28:50.696
Lauren, killing it today.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.999
You did fab task!

28:53.032 --> 28:57.503
Lauren pulled it out and beat
Cole, so couldn't be happier,

28:57.536 --> 28:58.670
you know.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.440
It was very important that Cole
did not win immunity today

29:01.473 --> 29:04.310
because Cole is the biggest
immunity challenge threat here.

29:04.343 --> 29:04.944
I need water.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.178
All right, I do, too.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.948
I'm sure other people do, too.

29:08.981 --> 29:09.415
Anyone need water?

29:09.448 --> 29:10.817
Are you going?

29:10.850 --> 29:11.918
Might as well.

29:11.951 --> 29:15.221
We're getting the main target
out, our hard target.

29:15.254 --> 29:19.125
But there's a big fear of a
hidden immunity idol, and that's

29:19.158 --> 29:23.029
why we can't just place all our
votes on one healer, so we have

29:23.062 --> 29:28.100
to split the votes into a four
and three.

29:28.134 --> 29:31.637
The fear of the unknown, right,
the biggest worry tonight is an

29:31.670 --> 29:32.872
idol.

29:32.905 --> 29:36.175
So why don't we just take the
fear of the unknown out, and do

29:36.208 --> 29:40.079
four Cole, three Mike... are
you...

29:40.112 --> 29:41.213
What?

29:41.247 --> 29:44.283
Now we're just completely
taking Joe off the chopping

29:44.316 --> 29:44.616
block?

29:44.650 --> 29:45.251
Right.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.886
But why Mike and not Joe?

29:46.919 --> 29:47.887
Because this is why.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.188
I'm pissed.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.389
Joe, he's like a rat.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.259
You lose track of him for one
second, and he's off trying to

29:53.292 --> 29:54.226
find another idol.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.962
He's off looking for advantages.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.564
He's very dangerous in may be
ways, and I think we're all just

29:58.597 --> 30:00.732
sick of him, and he needs to go.

30:00.766 --> 30:04.971
Ashley, Ashley...
He's going to spend every

30:05.004 --> 30:07.673
second...
We got lucky today.

30:07.706 --> 30:10.776
Four for Cole, three for Mike.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.279
You have to get past that
right this second.

30:13.312 --> 30:13.880
He's not a threat.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.081
Yes, he is.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.149
He finds idols nonstop.

30:17.183 --> 30:21.053
Somebody else plays an idesol...
If Mike plays an idol, if Mike

30:21.087 --> 30:23.255
plays an idol, he could be back
in place.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.356
I agree with that.

30:24.390 --> 30:27.626
Ashley, it's a group
decision, four for Cole, three

30:27.659 --> 30:29.195
for Mike.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.263
No matter what happens, one of
those two is going home.

30:31.297 --> 30:35.601
Ben told me to vote Cole
because he is a huge physical

30:35.634 --> 30:36.402
threat.

30:36.435 --> 30:37.369
I'm getting super annoyed.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.671
I don't need to be told what to
do right now.

30:39.705 --> 30:43.042
I'm going to do everything I can
to convince people to vote Joe

30:43.075 --> 30:46.445
because I can't be the only one
weighs these options in my head

30:46.478 --> 30:47.279
right now.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.715
It's gonna kill me not to vote
for Joe.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.184
I'm, like, putting out other
ideas.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.586
We're splitting two votes, Cole,
Mike.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.122
It's a steam rolling
situation.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.489
I want Joe gone.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.991
I want to do Joe.

30:59.025 --> 30:59.992
I do, too.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.860
What does that mean for Ben?

31:01.894 --> 31:05.397
Are we all just gog say,
"sorry, Ben, we're not with you

31:05.431 --> 31:07.833
on this one?"
Yes, this is not a

31:07.866 --> 31:09.936
dictatorship.

31:09.969 --> 31:13.205
Tell me who's everybody
voting for so I can vote, you

31:13.239 --> 31:14.806
know what I mean?

31:14.840 --> 31:15.441
Yeah.

31:15.474 --> 31:18.144
Tell me who to vote for.

31:18.177 --> 31:19.145
I'm okay doing whatever.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.113
I don't care.

31:21.147 --> 31:24.216
Now...
Huh...

31:24.250 --> 31:24.917
Listen.

31:24.951 --> 31:28.120
Between you and me... it's Cole.

31:28.154 --> 31:28.454
Okay?

31:28.487 --> 31:29.321
Uh-huh.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.290
Just don't tell Joe.

31:31.323 --> 31:35.127
Yeah.

31:35.161 --> 31:39.265
On faith for tonight's tribal
council, if I could believe Ben.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.666
But how much can I trust Ben?

31:40.699 --> 31:41.934
I can't.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.203
Every person that I've trusted
has betrayed my trust.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.105
So I'm not playing their game.

31:46.138 --> 31:51.777
I gotta do something to send one
of these big threats home.

31:51.810 --> 31:55.081
If they're smart, they'll do
Cole, and then me.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.748
As far as the split.

31:56.782 --> 31:57.849
Uh-huh.

31:57.883 --> 31:59.918
Here's my problem with this
whole situation.

31:59.952 --> 32:04.556
They're doing this now we have
to get Joe out because he's so

32:04.590 --> 32:06.725
atrocious, but they're still
planning to vote Cole out.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.560
I think there are ways we can
turn this upside down.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.261
I know there is.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.730
And get Ben out.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.933
It changes everything.

32:14.967 --> 32:19.205
The hustlers and heroes'
mentality are just playing for

32:19.238 --> 32:20.139
the next tribal council.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.407
And it's stupid.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.411
So because of that, I'm going to
make the world implode by

32:25.444 --> 32:30.282
playing my idol.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.151
Eenie-meenie-miney-moe, who am i
going to give it to?

32:32.184 --> 32:34.253
It might be hydraulic tonight.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.655
It's good big or go home time.

32:36.688 --> 32:40.026
What I didn't understand is
the logic behind voting for Mike

32:40.059 --> 32:41.227
versus voting for Joe.

32:41.260 --> 32:45.031
I was trying to flush an
idol, if Mike had one, for next

32:45.064 --> 32:46.165
one.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.433
I don't want to keep Joe here
with an idol out there.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.201
Joe is a huge threat to me.

32:49.235 --> 32:50.436
Right.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.971
I know Cole is a big physical
threat, but I don't think Cole

32:53.005 --> 32:54.873
is necessarily going to win
every challenge.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.543
But this...
What if Mike has the idol?

32:57.576 --> 33:00.946
I've been voting with Ben since
day one, but, apparently, we

33:00.979 --> 33:04.883
cannot ask questions and say,
"what is the logic behind voting

33:04.916 --> 33:08.287
for Dr. Mike?"
I am more nervous about Joe

33:08.320 --> 33:09.221
finding idols.

33:09.255 --> 33:12.891
That's why I think we need to
vote for Joe.

33:12.924 --> 33:16.062
I just told Mike to vote for
Cole.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.296
Instead of Joe.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.732
I'm not trying to be a dictator
here, but for my game, I don't

33:20.766 --> 33:23.969
want Joe gone because everyone
already can't stand the guy.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.505
Unfortunately, some people,
they're playing with their heart

33:26.538 --> 33:28.440
and their morals.

33:28.474 --> 33:32.478
In "survivor," heart and morals
don't get you a million dollars.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.914
People are starting to feel a
tiny bit steam rolled by you.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.316
No, no, they're not.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.251
You might and Ashley might.

33:39.285 --> 33:41.453
It's the safest bet possible.

33:41.487 --> 33:45.657
At this point, it's sort of
become Ben's way or the highway.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.960
I know there is a game strategy,
and the game strategy says get

33:48.994 --> 33:51.297
Cole out first, get Joe out
second.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.466
But, frankly, there's no bigger
strategic threat than Joe.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.704
And I know that this is not
Ben's plan, but I believe that

33:58.737 --> 34:00.005
Ashley feels that way as well.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.075
There are a lot of threats left
in this game.

34:03.109 --> 34:13.152
Now we have to decide what to
do.

34:13.152 --> 34:20.458
Now we have to decide what to
do.

34:20.492 --> 34:26.697
JEFF: We'll now bring in
the first member of our jury.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.335
I need to you follow my lead
tonight.

34:29.368 --> 34:35.274
Trust me.

34:38.744 --> 34:46.784
JEFF: Desi, voted out at
the last tribal council.

34:46.818 --> 34:51.389
All right, so, Joe, we start
with three tribes, instant

34:51.422 --> 34:51.790
animosity.

34:51.822 --> 34:52.558
Then we swap.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.592
Now there's some
cross-pollination.

34:54.626 --> 34:55.627
But now we're 24 days in.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.329
You're starting to see the end.

34:57.363 --> 34:59.165
So where is the game right now?

34:59.198 --> 35:02.334
Well, from my point of view,
the game is lost.

35:02.368 --> 35:07.173
You know, I'm not part of the
roundtable, and the roundtable

35:07.206 --> 35:08.073
consists of seven.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.676
Mike's not part of the
roundtable, neither.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.611
I'm the cowt Jester.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.346
JEFF: Joe who are the three
not in it?

35:14.380 --> 35:18.116
The healers are the only ones
not part of the roundtable at

35:18.150 --> 35:19.351
this moment.

35:19.385 --> 35:22.120
JEFF: Does it seem obvious
it's Joe, you, and Mike that are

35:22.154 --> 35:23.322
in trouble?

35:23.355 --> 35:26.024
Yes, I feel like me and Joe
are first and foremost on the

35:26.057 --> 35:28.394
chopping block, and I'm not
involved in any strategies or

35:28.427 --> 35:31.297
there's no game play going on
with me at all.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.533
JEFF: Chrissy, there's been
a lot going on at tribal lately

35:34.566 --> 35:35.401
with people having it out.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.002
What's the vibe at camp right
now?

35:37.035 --> 35:42.241
The vibe at camp as of
yesterday was extremely

35:42.274 --> 35:43.509
difficult.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.478
Joe came after Ashley and I and
it was just a nonstop barrage of

35:46.512 --> 35:47.112
insults.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.414
It went far past game play.

35:48.447 --> 35:54.420
Can I...
Yes, please, Mike.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.422
Honestly, I am disappointed
in my tribe.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.424
I believe that "survivor"
represents society.

35:58.457 --> 36:01.527
We have to play with justifiable
moral and ethical codes of

36:01.560 --> 36:03.729
conduct here.

36:03.762 --> 36:07.666
So saying Joe is offending us
and painting him as a pariah but

36:07.699 --> 36:11.237
then not voting him out is not
playing this game of high moral

36:11.270 --> 36:14.240
character, and if that means me
speaking up I put a target on my

36:14.273 --> 36:15.341
back, fine.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.309
But I try to play this game with
high moral character.

36:17.343 --> 36:21.046
So if Ben is king Arthur at the
roundtable, I am happy to be the

36:21.079 --> 36:25.917
statue of liberty in America,
because America is going to beat

36:25.951 --> 36:27.052
in the end.

36:27.085 --> 36:29.455
JEFF: Lauren, is the
missing element in Mike's thesis

36:29.488 --> 36:34.793
the word "justifiable?"
Meaning, you justify your vote

36:34.826 --> 36:37.629
based on game play, strategy,
trust, lack of trust?

36:37.663 --> 36:41.900
But all you have to do is say,
"oh, I have my own reasons,

36:41.933 --> 36:43.001
sorry."

36:43.034 --> 36:45.036
I totally agree with what
he's saying if we weren't

36:45.070 --> 36:46.272
playing "survivor."

36:46.305 --> 36:48.039
The fact of the matter, is
Lauren, you're going to have to

36:48.073 --> 36:49.941
justify how you...
I don't act that way.

36:49.975 --> 36:53.979
Make Joe into a pariah and
then not vote for him.

36:54.012 --> 36:57.583
I think you're showing poor
moral character.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.751
Do you want to take the
shovel and bury yourself.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.354
The hole is deeper and deeper
and you didn't have to open your

37:02.388 --> 37:03.555
mouth.

37:03.589 --> 37:06.492
Jeff, I think the hardest
part about our decision tonight

37:06.525 --> 37:11.597
is how do we vote tonight so
that we can be successful at the

37:11.630 --> 37:12.163
next tribal.

37:12.197 --> 37:15.434
Who is "we" Chrissy.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.668
The alliance of seven.

37:16.702 --> 37:19.104
JEFF: Cole, when Chrissy
was talking and saying, "look,

37:19.137 --> 37:20.306
it's not just tonight.

37:20.339 --> 37:23.642
It's the next one and the next
one and from hereon out."

37:23.675 --> 37:25.344
Is that a little concerning?

37:25.377 --> 37:28.747
Yeah, I felt like her
statement was pretty clear at

37:28.780 --> 37:30.015
me.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.318
I mean, I'm the person who could
be able to screw it up next time

37:32.351 --> 37:34.119
by winning the immunity
challenge.

37:34.152 --> 37:37.155
Jeff, these people live in a
fantasy world.

37:37.188 --> 37:38.490
Nobody is playing the game.

37:38.524 --> 37:42.728
Everybody is waiting for the
magical seven, and boom, then

37:42.761 --> 37:43.362
everybody starts playing.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.830
I don't see that happening.

37:44.863 --> 37:48.667
Maybe we'll change that at
some point in time.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.269
It will be four heroes and
three hustlers.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.205
When are people going to realize
three does not beat four?

37:54.239 --> 37:57.876
Jeff, you can have all the
numbers on your hand and do all

37:57.909 --> 38:01.079
the counting you want, but you
cannot calculate relationships,

38:01.112 --> 38:04.082
emotion, you cannot calculate
deception.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.384
The game happens in every
conversation you have.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.252
You can't calculate those
things.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.821
JEFF: And, Ben, with
Ashley's comment, she brings it

38:09.855 --> 38:12.691
all back to Mike's original
premise offing about a society.

38:12.724 --> 38:13.959
It's not just numbers.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.527
It's the relationships.

38:15.561 --> 38:19.631
The relationships we build,
two, three of those are going to

38:19.665 --> 38:20.899
get you to the end.

38:20.932 --> 38:25.303
The thing that puts Joe outside
of those relationships is Joe's

38:25.337 --> 38:26.438
mouth.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.807
He talks about the roundtable,
the king and his knights.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.510
But he's the only one living in
a fantasy world right now.

38:31.543 --> 38:36.314
JEFF: I'm fascinated with
this because Cole has somehow

38:36.348 --> 38:41.219
managed to shrink his body as if
to say, "maybe no one will

38:41.252 --> 38:42.220
remember I'm here."

38:42.253 --> 38:44.423
Thanks, Jeff.

38:44.456 --> 38:48.860
It came in pretty grim but who
knows, there's so much stirred

38:48.894 --> 38:51.196
up and him opening his mouth and
maybe that's good for me.

38:51.229 --> 38:54.533
JEFF: I see heads, Joe has
been talking, Mike's been

38:54.566 --> 38:55.434
talking.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.504
That's playing the game of
"survivor"!

38:58.537 --> 38:59.905
JEFF: Ben is talking.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.006
It's chaos right now.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.340
Ladies?

39:02.374 --> 39:03.375
Yeah, we're good.

39:03.409 --> 39:03.975
Let's vote.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.176
We're ready.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.814
Mike, are you ready or do you
want to keep groog I'm good.

39:08.847 --> 39:13.051
JEFF: All right, it's been
a crazy tribal.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.754
Let's figure out where it's gog
land.

39:15.787 --> 39:16.522
It's time to vote.

39:16.555 --> 39:21.427
Lauren, you're up.

39:51.222 --> 39:59.431
JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

39:59.465 --> 40:02.333
JEFF: If anybody has a
hidden immunity idol and you

40:02.367 --> 40:09.374
want to play it, now would be
the time to do so.

40:09.407 --> 40:16.715
I think America's going to
stay one more day.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.950
Your tired, your poor, your
hungry.

40:18.984 --> 40:24.790
I'm playing it for me.

40:24.823 --> 40:28.193
JEFF: This is a hidden
immunity idol.

40:28.226 --> 40:31.597
Any votes cast for Mike will not
count.

40:31.630 --> 40:35.366
I'll read the votes.

40:35.400 --> 40:40.772
First vote, Ben.

40:40.806 --> 40:41.206
Mike.

40:41.239 --> 40:45.711
Does not count.

40:45.744 --> 40:46.144
Mike.

40:46.177 --> 40:53.018
Does not count.

40:53.051 --> 40:53.819
Cole.

40:53.852 --> 40:57.322
That's one vote Ben, one vote
Cole.

40:57.355 --> 40:57.756
Cole.

40:57.789 --> 41:01.827
Two votes Cole.

41:01.860 --> 41:02.661
Cole.

41:02.694 --> 41:07.465
That's three votes Cole, one
vote Ben.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.266
Cole.

41:08.299 --> 41:12.804
Four votes Cole.

41:12.838 --> 41:16.074
Ninth person voted out and the
second member of our jury, Cole.

41:16.107 --> 41:16.708
It's five.

41:16.742 --> 41:17.408
That's enough.

41:17.442 --> 41:22.681
You need to bring me your torch.

41:28.453 --> 41:31.590
Cole, the tribe has spoken.

41:31.623 --> 41:33.258
Good luck, guys.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.492
Have fun out there.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.394
JEFF: Time for you to go.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.629
Good game, bud.

41:37.663 --> 41:38.797
You, too.

41:38.830 --> 41:47.138
JEFF: Well, alliances are
the cornerstone of "survivor."

41:47.172 --> 41:50.408
But as the number of people
dwindle, those on the bottom get

41:50.441 --> 41:52.978
desperate, and it gets more
difficult to keep alliances

41:53.011 --> 41:53.444
together.

41:53.478 --> 41:53.912
Grab your torches.

41:53.945 --> 41:54.746
Head back to camp.

41:54.780 --> 41:58.584
Good night.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.234
JEFF:
JEFF: Next time on

42:16.267 --> 42:17.168
"survivor."

42:17.202 --> 42:18.704
The alliance of seven seems
set in stone.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.106
Joe and Mike are dead men
walking.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.908
JEFF: But they start to
crumble from within.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.777
This whole trust in the seven
alliance is crap.

42:25.811 --> 42:28.580
If you're stupid enough to
really think it's going to last,

42:28.614 --> 42:29.347
then something's wrong.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.549
We want to talk to you guys.

42:31.583 --> 42:35.721
Stay tuned, I think it's
about to get really good.

42:35.754 --> 42:39.524
I was hoping it would be Joe
instead of me.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.860
Everyone is gunning for me
because they see me as a

42:41.893 --> 42:42.728
physical threat.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.863
I'm so grateful and thankful to
be here.

42:44.896 --> 42:49.000
I played hard and no regrets at
all.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.670
The highlight of my day was when
i got to go fishing and hang out

42:51.703 --> 42:52.871
with Jessica.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.440
I hope that continues to be the
highlight of my days in the

42:55.473 --> 42:55.674
future.
