WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:06.774
I'm Tom Swift,
inventor, billionaire,

00:06.907 --> 00:09.143
shoe collector extraordinaire.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.179
But none of that was
good enough for my dad.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.347
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

00:13.481 --> 00:15.483
I could earn his love,

00:15.616 --> 00:17.151
but his mission ended
tragically.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.252
Or so I thought.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.821
Turns out it was sabotage.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.524
My father survived the attack
and sent me a message capsule

00:23.657 --> 00:26.327
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.163
ut it exploded when it enteredB
the atmosphere.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.199
Now I have to find
the pieces of that capsule

00:31.332 --> 00:33.367
nd reassemble my dad's message.a

00:33.501 --> 00:35.536
A global conspiracy called
The Road Back

00:35.669 --> 00:36.704
is standing in my way,

00:36.837 --> 00:39.140
so I can only trust my squad:

00:39.273 --> 00:41.142
my best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

00:41.275 --> 00:42.843
my adopted brother Lino,

00:42.976 --> 00:44.612
and my A.I. Barclay.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.347
Together, we're going
to find my father

00:46.480 --> 00:48.149
and bring him home.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.461
We gotta go.
He'll be back any minute.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.630
Yeah, I know how stealing
works, thank you.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.532
I just didn't think
that breaking and entering

01:04.665 --> 01:07.034
would be required
to find this capsule piece.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.036
I thought we were just
going to Tribeca.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.139
ZENZI:
I know, I looked.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.806
Susannah moved it.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.009
It's, uh, it's the only piece
that we could lock onto.

01:16.144 --> 01:19.713
Now we have to liberate it
from this hoarder's paradise.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.350
Yeah, well, Tom's gonna
be pissed we did this.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.052
The way he talked about
his dad...

01:25.186 --> 01:27.721
I believe him, but that wasn't
the Barton that I knew.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.223
Yeah. Me neither.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.992
And Tom's as fine
as anyone would be

01:32.092 --> 01:34.395
if they found out
that their dad tried to

01:34.528 --> 01:37.565
lobotomize the fabulous
out of them at 13.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.567
I'm sure he's processing
his emotions

01:39.700 --> 01:41.269
through some man's pants
right now.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.171
Healing takes many paths.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.705
Yeah, I'd rather have him
mad at us

01:44.838 --> 01:46.440
than to miss the window
to send the rescue drone

01:46.574 --> 01:47.675
to help Uncle Barton.
It's only...

01:47.775 --> 01:50.110
Eight hours to apogee.
Yeah.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.613
I think...

01:52.746 --> 01:54.382
Ah. I found it.

01:54.515 --> 01:58.919
Damn it, it's stuck on
this Jet Beauty of the Week.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.457
Is that Keyshia Cole?

02:12.366 --> 02:13.967
Eskol is fine, by the way.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.404
At a safe house.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.440
The less you know
the better, though.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.209
Thanks.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.047
Just can't believe
I fell for another

02:27.147 --> 02:30.784
tainted, shiny object.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.454
It's like Marcus:
murder edition.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.889
You deserve a man
who's as shiny on the inside

02:35.989 --> 02:37.958
as he is
on the outside.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.261
A partner.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.132
Let's get out of here.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.135
I think Keyshia gave me
a paper cut.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.808
*

03:02.850 --> 03:04.184
TOM:
I'm Tom Swift.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.686
I'm a bad bitch.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.288
(grunts)

03:07.421 --> 03:08.522
I'm Tom Swift.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.324
I'm a bad bitch,

03:10.458 --> 03:11.959
and I am not in my feelings.

03:12.092 --> 03:12.993
Be a man.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.828
(exhales) Tom Swift.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.831
A man doesn't prance around
half-naked and wear pants

03:17.965 --> 03:19.833
that are vacuum-sealed
to his ass.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.636
Maybe if you didn't borrow
Barack's leftover suits, you--

03:22.770 --> 03:24.538
Mmm. Okay, okay.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.707
I'm Tom Swift.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.008
I'm a bad bitch,

03:28.141 --> 03:29.677
and I'm not in my feelings.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.613
I'm Tom Swift.
I'm a bad bitch.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.215
And I'm not in my feelings.
(exhales)

03:35.349 --> 03:36.784
I'm Tom Swift, baby.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.719
I'm a bad bitch.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.321
And I'm not in my feelings.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.022
BARCLAY: How about a nice,
soothing car model?

03:42.155 --> 03:44.692
Big rims always make you smile.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.360
Must you always
choose pink?

03:46.994 --> 03:49.330
Yo, it's a car.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.332
What is straighter than a--

03:51.465 --> 03:53.367
* So I know I'm straight,
heavyweight *

03:53.501 --> 03:55.903
* I'll go all in,
'cause hesitate... *

03:56.036 --> 03:57.571
You know what?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.840
Ah.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.475
Baby, I'm Tom Swift.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.577
I'm a bad bitch,

04:03.711 --> 04:04.878
and I am...

04:05.012 --> 04:06.179
You're what?

04:06.314 --> 04:07.214
BARCLAY:
Good morning, Mrs. Swift.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.649
Going into "stay out

04:08.749 --> 04:10.150
of grown folks' business" mode.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.053
I am Tom Swift, and...

04:13.186 --> 04:15.589
I'm not gonna skip leg day.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.491
Okay, where are we with
the drone to rescue your father?

04:17.591 --> 04:18.992
Has there been any progress?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.762
You told me we need
to be ready by apogee.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.230
That's in less than six hours.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.202
Tom.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.704
Talk to me.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.578
No.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.518
ZENZI: Um, I'm
sorry to interrupt.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.421
I got the second to last
capsule piece, Aunt Lorraine.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.858
There's just
one piece more.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.893
We'll be ready.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.276
(sighs)

05:09.410 --> 05:12.112
So Isaac and I got
the capsule piece we could get,

05:12.245 --> 05:14.147
but The Road Back has
the last one.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.284
We need your help.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.153
The Swift Black Engineering
Futures conference

05:20.287 --> 05:22.956
is one of our biggest
events of the year,

05:23.090 --> 05:25.125
so we'll make an appearance,

05:25.258 --> 05:27.461
and then we'll get
the last piece from Susannah

05:27.595 --> 05:28.762
and launch the rescue drone.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.499
You want to pick a car
and a shoe, maybe?

05:31.632 --> 05:34.802
That sounds like
a Barton problem.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.104
Maybe he has
some gummies for that,

05:37.237 --> 05:40.641
or an everlasting gaystopper.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.177
(sighs)

06:07.334 --> 06:10.170
Please make sure all the
engineers have been checked in

06:10.303 --> 06:11.972
and have been fitted
for Swiftsight.
Yes.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.441
Okay, this is gonna be
fantastic.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.476
(laughs) Yes.
Yes.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.310
Oh, no, no, no,
I've got this.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.980
It's important that a CEO
get her hands dirty.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.616
Or my hands dirty
in this case.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.153
So, Tom is going to use these

06:26.286 --> 06:29.356
to solve the Riemann Hypothesis?

06:29.490 --> 06:31.725
That prime number theorem
has remained unsolved

06:31.859 --> 06:33.861
for 160 years.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.896
The upgraded Swiftsights
don't just transfer

06:36.029 --> 06:37.698
information between brains.

06:37.831 --> 06:41.234
They also allow us
to merge our minds.

06:41.368 --> 06:44.672
Look, these will surpass the
boundaries of spoken language

06:44.805 --> 06:47.374
and human capacity
to attack a problem.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.544
And that is why we're
debuting it here.
Hmm.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.880
I am so proud.

06:53.013 --> 06:56.416
Mutual math isn't exactly
my idea of a good time.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.086
It's more like a massive
multi-player game.

06:59.219 --> 07:02.556
Or as Tom described it,
a circuit party for fractions.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.593
It's revolutionary.
And genius.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.596
(clears throat)
Okay, I'm gonna go.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.763
Okay.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.067
Good help is so
hard to find.

07:16.504 --> 07:19.540
So, tell me about
the dinner party

07:19.673 --> 07:21.408
Tom had at the Manor.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.678
You mentioned
Susannah Robb attended.

07:24.778 --> 07:29.016
As CEO, it's imperative
that I be kept abreast of

07:29.116 --> 07:31.018
any meeting with an investor.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.420
Did I mention that?

07:33.554 --> 07:37.424
You know, Tom must have
forgotten to text you.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.027
I guess I've just
been fuzzy lately.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.795
You need to get some good rest.

07:41.929 --> 07:45.566
Maybe a stronger formulation
of lip gel is in order.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.704
BARCLAY:
You exercised, shopped,

07:50.804 --> 07:52.706
and unfollowed your dad
on Instagram,

07:52.806 --> 07:54.608
and your mood remains
at a four.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.444
Should I sing "Hot in Herre"
in the British accent again?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.946
City Girls?

07:59.079 --> 08:00.113
* Act up, so you can... *

08:00.247 --> 08:02.149
Barclay!

08:02.282 --> 08:04.117
What would make you
feel better, Tom?

08:04.251 --> 08:07.120
How about a nice self-esteem
boosting back-breaking session?

08:07.254 --> 08:08.421
I need to call Justin.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.123
Excellent.
I'll ready the lubes.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.225
Nah, I need to apologize.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.295
(ringing)

08:16.263 --> 08:17.464
Thomas?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.166
I'm sorry.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.802
You helped me, and...

08:21.935 --> 08:24.304
I shouldn't have
gone off on you.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.773
You're apologizing?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.808
Are you in danger,
and this is your clue?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.944
No. I just...
want to do it different.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.146
Like, I don't want
to use people

08:33.280 --> 08:35.482
and make them feel like
they're not good enough.

08:35.616 --> 08:39.319
I know I treated you like that,
and I'm sorry.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.322
Thank you.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.491
But honestly,
this isn't really necessary.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.660
I figured you were sorry
when you texted me

08:46.794 --> 08:47.995
to give Susannah the Swiftsight.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.698
I-I texted what?

08:50.831 --> 08:53.834
Uh, Barclay, pull up the texts
between Justin and I

08:53.967 --> 08:56.003
from the past 24 hours.
Share screen.

08:56.136 --> 08:59.172
I'm right on top of that.
Blurring all orifices.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.511
It's gone. I...

09:04.645 --> 09:06.714
I swear it was there, Tom.
It came from you.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.182
No, it... it didn't.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.985
It came from her.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.486
JUSTIN:
No.

09:13.621 --> 09:16.657
Susannah must have faked
the push notifications

09:16.790 --> 09:18.358
to make it look like
a text from me.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.960
Yeah, but all the Swiftsights
are at the conference.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.194
What does she want?

09:22.462 --> 09:24.331
I do hope your answer is yes.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.167
Otherwise there will be
consequences.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.469
I think it's how
they send their message:

09:29.569 --> 09:31.238
don't fly too close
to the sun.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.907
She wants me to have
consequences.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.809
I have to go to the conference.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.510
Justin, thank you.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.747
Be careful.
(call beeps off)

09:39.880 --> 09:41.715
Time to be a bad bitch.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.223
(upbeat music playing)
(loud, indistinct chatter)

09:51.892 --> 09:53.493
WILSON:
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:53.593 --> 09:56.563
introducing the Swift
Enterprises infrasonic cannon.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.065
All right, everyone,
so as you can see here

09:58.198 --> 09:59.566
we have a pretty
low setting.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.868
You all look so
nervous right now.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.569
What is about
to happen? Right?

10:02.703 --> 10:04.237
All right,
so here we go.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.207
(device powering up)
Ready? Here we go.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.577
(grunts)

10:10.711 --> 10:13.513
Ehh, completely harmless.
Completely harmless. He's fine.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.282
You're good? How do you feel?
Great.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.784
WILSON: Yeah?
Very good, very good.
Yeah. Thank you.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.551
All right, who's next?
Sir, how about you?

10:18.686 --> 10:20.087
Come on up.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.191
QUINN:
Have you ever left a dinner
feeling completely unsatisfied?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.393
Well, the Swift Flavor Saver

10:26.526 --> 10:27.928
enhances seasoning profiles,

10:28.061 --> 10:30.263
so you'll never have to leave
Brett's house

10:30.397 --> 10:31.932
feeling bland again.
(laughter)

10:32.065 --> 10:34.101
Tom. Oh, my God.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.137
I was so sad about your dad.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.939
He was such a good dad.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.774
Oh, well. Thank you.
You're lucky.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.475
Can we get a picture?

10:42.609 --> 10:44.144
Sure.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.250
Okay. Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.319
Thank you so much.
Oh, my God.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.833
Relax.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.769
I'm not gonna set
anything on fire.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.738
Angela Bassett already did that
better than me.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.472
(sighs)

11:12.605 --> 11:15.743
Susannah stole a Swiftsight
from the house last night.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.979
She faked a push notification
to Justin's phone,

11:19.112 --> 11:21.481
and I think her "Operation
Moseley" may be in action.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.517
Damn it, Justin.
Don't you remember Vegas?

11:24.651 --> 11:25.953
You told me you can

11:26.086 --> 11:27.154
never trust a twink.
Never trust a twink.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.322
Look, Susannah gave me
a choice:

11:29.456 --> 11:33.193
join her,
or face consequences.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.328
I think she's found some way
to hurt the people here.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.131
Maybe with Swiftsight,
maybe with something else.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.034
But I'm her Black Icarus,

11:41.168 --> 11:43.670
and today she wants
to melt my lace.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.505
There-there have to be moles
in the group.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.774
Get security.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.541
Round everyone up
for questioning.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.611
You'd like us to accuse
200 Black engineers of sabotage

11:51.711 --> 11:54.214
and then offer them
a box lunch?

11:54.347 --> 11:56.383
TOM: Okay, uh,
maybe we can find

11:56.516 --> 11:58.385
a more subtle way
to deal with this?

11:58.518 --> 11:59.853
Look.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.188
We can figure it out.
We can stall.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.689
Keep your comms on.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.525
As long as nobody
puts on Swiftsight, we're good.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.532
Hey.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.367
You want to help me
try it out?

12:14.501 --> 12:17.170
No.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.539
Come on, I just...

12:19.672 --> 12:21.875
I just want
to see my mom.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.878
We went to the Bronx Zoo
before Christmas in 2010.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.986
Okay.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.088
But be quick.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.191
Don't rush my memory.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.906
(rap music playing)

12:53.040 --> 12:55.275
Don't let anyone use these.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.944
Hi. I'm sorry. Thank you.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.745
No one's tried theirs. You?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.513
TOM (over comm):
I grabbed all the ones
in the east wing.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.250
Isaac?
All good here, too.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.752
TOM:
All right, the rest of them
are locked up in the office.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.187
I think we're gonna be okay.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.521
GIRL: Can we
get a photo?
Yeah, come on.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.923
Of course you can get a pic.
Yeah.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.092
*

13:13.226 --> 13:16.029
Thank you.
(Lino screaming)

13:17.697 --> 13:19.066
LINO: No!
Don't burn me!

13:19.199 --> 13:21.034
No!
What's going on? Lino.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.435
(Lino panting)
I don't know what's happening.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.971
Don't burn me!

13:24.104 --> 13:25.305
ZENZI: Lino!
Oh, my God.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.440
Hey. Hey, hey.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.412
ZENZI: Lino. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.047
I saw my mom.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.916
She kept shouting
that I was the light

13:36.049 --> 13:37.417
and I needed
to be purified.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.952
I just wanted to see
a good memory,

13:39.086 --> 13:40.787
but it kept showing me
the same messed-up thing

13:40.921 --> 13:43.790
over and over and over!

13:43.924 --> 13:45.225
(sobbing)

13:45.325 --> 13:47.427
It showed him his worst memories
on a loop?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.628
How could she do that?

13:48.761 --> 13:50.263
(sobs, grunts)

13:50.397 --> 13:52.465
This is why Susannah wanted
the Swiftsight.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.134
The brain stores trauma.
It can be found

13:54.267 --> 13:55.936
even if we don't know
where it is.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.671
Clearly it simulated a TBI,
and it made him perseverate.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.340
I saw that in Afghanistan.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.475
He got that image in his head
and couldn't get it out.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.978
Susannah must have wanted
to give us all PTSD.

14:05.112 --> 14:08.248
Barclay, run an EMDR sequence.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.749
BARCLAY:
Engaging Eye Movement

14:09.849 --> 14:12.319
and Desensitization
Reprocessing protocol.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.688
Watch this carefully

14:15.822 --> 14:17.357
and tell me what you see.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.825
(exhales, sniffles)

14:18.959 --> 14:21.128
My mom, Violet,

14:21.261 --> 14:24.631
she brought me
next to the fire, uh,

14:24.764 --> 14:27.267
held me down
when I tried to get away

14:27.367 --> 14:29.002
and tried to put my hand
in the fire.

14:34.141 --> 14:38.345
EMDR sequences help people
desensitize traumatic memories.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.680
I ran an accelerated
version on Lino.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.516
The memories are
still troubling,

14:43.650 --> 14:46.886
but perseveration has stopped.
Okay?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.693
(device beeping)

14:56.163 --> 14:57.130
Found it.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.898
Susannah thought she was slick

14:59.032 --> 15:00.633
by hiding it
in the liquid memory.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.702
But it's just basic.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.571
Basic like her bangs,

15:04.704 --> 15:07.707
and basic like that
fancy moped.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.043
Barclay, send this
across the air

15:10.177 --> 15:12.045
to every Swiftsight in
existence.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.214
And your dad's capsule piece?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.589
(phone rings)

15:22.722 --> 15:25.058
SUSANNAH:
Tommy!

15:25.192 --> 15:27.060
I see Lino unwrapped
his gift early.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.561
How's his head?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.763
You think you're smarter
than me. That's cute.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.566
Intelligence really isn't
about capacity, is it?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.402
It's about execution.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.570
Now you see what will
become of the world

15:37.704 --> 15:39.406
if you do not join me.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.742
Join us, 'cause it will take
brilliance like ours

15:42.875 --> 15:45.078
to stop the world's
reckless quest for discovery.

15:45.212 --> 15:49.249
Susannah, I've already heard
your desperate,

15:49.382 --> 15:52.085
desperate sales pitch,
and I'm gonna use

15:52.219 --> 15:54.921
a technical term for you.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.424
Hell... no.

15:57.557 --> 16:01.428
I found your little elementary,
uninspired excuse

16:01.561 --> 16:02.962
for a hack of Swiftsight. Girl!

16:07.067 --> 16:09.702
You will never hurt us again.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.138
Shucks.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.606
Guess you got me, Tom.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.110
(people screaming)

16:23.750 --> 16:26.419
(alarmed cries)
(pained shouting)

16:29.756 --> 16:31.458
(Zenzi cries out)

16:31.591 --> 16:32.959
I thought all the
Swiftsights were off.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.428
They were. Something else
is affecting people.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.097
It's not just Swiftsight.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.631
Susannah's got to
something else here.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.574
It could be a chemical agent.
Something airborne.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.109
Maybe it's in the T-shirts.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.143
Look, I'll tend to the people
on the floor,

16:50.277 --> 16:51.611
y'all find the exits.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.313
Those infrasonic cannons
they demonstrated,

16:53.446 --> 16:55.315
they gave us all
Havana Syndrome,

16:55.448 --> 16:57.417
like those people at
the embassies in Cuba.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.018
Okay.
My heart is racing.
I can't breathe.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.820
But the cannons we used
on the Chocolate Cowboys

17:00.953 --> 17:02.122
didn't make me sick.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.490
(person retching)

17:03.623 --> 17:06.526
Wait, Tom. What if someone
poisoned the food?

17:06.659 --> 17:09.162
Okay. Barclay, cross-reference
poison symptoms.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.863
Arrhythmia, nausea, vomiting.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.199
Grab one of those cones.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.101
Look for anything
that's not popcorn.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.503
BARCLAY:
Poisons causing arrhythmia,
vomiting and nausea

17:16.636 --> 17:18.671
are almost too many to mention.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.373
Tom, what is this?

17:24.311 --> 17:27.347
Cherry pits. The flavor savers.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.182
She must have had them swapped.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.717
Cyanide.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.019
Cherry pits can be
ground up to make cyanide.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.287
We need to find an antidote.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.555
BARCLAY:
Standard antidote would be

17:35.688 --> 17:37.624
activated charcoal
and chelation.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.691
Do we have that?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.693
No, but, um, we do have

17:40.827 --> 17:42.129
cobalt.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.164
Dicobalt reverses cyanide.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.832
Go get Mom's blue earrings

17:45.965 --> 17:47.700
and take the battery from
the phone that Dad gave her,

17:47.834 --> 17:49.369
with the extended
battery life. Go!

17:49.502 --> 17:52.372
We're making progress, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.707
Isaac, Zenzi, how we looking?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.376
Not great.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.677
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

17:57.810 --> 17:58.978
I can't get ahold of 911.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.713
Barclay doesn't
pick locks, does he?

18:00.847 --> 18:03.883
Stand back. Stand back.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.052
(woman cries out)

18:07.354 --> 18:09.522
Mom!

18:09.656 --> 18:11.224
Tom said to give me
your cobalt earrings

18:11.358 --> 18:14.093
and the phone battery
Dad gave you.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.565
(gasps, cries out)

18:18.698 --> 18:19.866
If he won't listen to Susannah,

18:19.999 --> 18:21.234
maybe he'll listen
to his mother.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.002
Hey! Let her go!

18:31.010 --> 18:33.413
Get off!

18:35.448 --> 18:36.616
Stay where you are.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.122
Oh, my God,
Claire.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.926
That gel you used on him...

18:48.561 --> 18:51.130
...it's the same thing
you've been giving me.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.266
Isn't it?
Lorraine...

18:59.572 --> 19:01.774
All they did was
touch the door.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.042
Hello?

19:05.278 --> 19:07.647
BOTH:
So did we.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.285
(panicked shouting)

19:17.290 --> 19:18.625
TOM:
Break that battery for me.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.095
We can use the pure cobalt
in Mom's earrings

19:23.230 --> 19:24.497
to counteract the cyanide...

19:26.433 --> 19:28.568
...then mix the acid
from the battery

19:28.668 --> 19:29.802
with the acid from the soda

19:29.936 --> 19:31.304
to create a chelating agent

19:31.438 --> 19:33.506
that will remove the toxins
from the body.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.142
It's highly concentrated.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.577
A few drops of this
should cleanse the poison

19:37.677 --> 19:39.979
right out of their systems.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.861
Tom, we need you.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.330
Oh, okay, okay, um...

19:57.464 --> 19:59.599
Look, two parts cobalt,
one part cola.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.033
Dilute it with water,

20:01.167 --> 20:02.669
and give it to everyone
who had the popcorn.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.537
Okay?
I got you.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.841
TOM:
Okay.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.176
Hey, hey, hey.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.812
The appetizers,
they had cyanide in them.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.714
Did you guys have
anything to eat?

20:14.847 --> 20:16.383
There wasn't exactly
time for snacks.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.017
ISAAC:
Tom, the door.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.321
Um, um...

20:21.454 --> 20:25.358
Um, Barclay, enter scan mode.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.863
Barclay, what is this?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.533
BARCLAY:
I-I don't know.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.035
Unable to identify
the concentrate.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.870
Ah!

20:41.341 --> 20:44.043
TOM:
Susannah is attacking every
person at this conference.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.378
How do I save them all?

20:52.719 --> 20:54.754
(indistinct, pained chatter)

20:57.690 --> 21:00.593
Hey! Hey, everybody,
listen to me.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.729
Let me get
everybody's attention.

21:04.531 --> 21:07.934
Today, we were attacked
by an organization

21:08.067 --> 21:10.269
who is trying to destroy...
No, this is your fault!

21:10.403 --> 21:11.771
You wanted to try
your new tech out on us,

21:11.904 --> 21:13.172
and you didn't care
if it hurt.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.409
(all agreeing)

21:16.543 --> 21:18.110
Swift Enterprises...

21:18.244 --> 21:22.949
I would never use
something dangerous

21:23.082 --> 21:24.451
to hurt my own people.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.753
My family's here.
They were attacked as well.

21:26.886 --> 21:31.724
All right? Look,
why would I hurt us? Us!?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.593
I am one of you.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.929
Okay? Look,

21:37.063 --> 21:39.366
the real way
our adversaries kill us

21:39.466 --> 21:41.701
is to make us turn
against each other

21:41.801 --> 21:44.070
and-and destroy
the seeds of trust

21:44.203 --> 21:46.473
that have always been
our foundation.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.941
(murmurs of agreement)
(applause)

21:49.075 --> 21:50.943
The only way we can survive

21:51.077 --> 21:54.113
is to rely on each other.
ALL: Yeah!

21:54.246 --> 21:57.617
Together, we can invent
the power

21:57.750 --> 21:59.118
that freedom requires.

21:59.251 --> 22:02.455
Look, I know
I can't solve this alone.

22:02.589 --> 22:05.492
All right? But if we use
our Swiftsights,

22:05.625 --> 22:07.460
we can take our
collective power,

22:07.594 --> 22:10.129
and we can help save our friends
and our family. Come on, y'all.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.898
Let's go! Let's go!

22:11.998 --> 22:14.967
Join me if you specialize
in organic chem.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.436
We'll break down the compound.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.971
Civil engineers,
let's get these doors open.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.508
ENGINEER:
Biomedical, squad up.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.176
(Swiftsights chiming)

22:24.310 --> 22:26.345
*

22:34.687 --> 22:37.457
Tom, we got it.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.125
The compound on the doors
is VX gas.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.793
We need atropine.
Okay.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.161
Who has stomach meds?

22:42.294 --> 22:44.030
Intestinal medication
has atropine.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.833
That and nanocream should get
the toxins out of the system.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.169
Yes. Lay it down, lay it down.

22:55.642 --> 22:58.144
Isaac, here. Take this.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.881
I got you. I got you.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.352
All right. All right?

23:07.820 --> 23:08.955
Good.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.189
Hey, help him up.

23:12.358 --> 23:13.960
Zenzi.
Mm.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.896
Got you. (exhales)

23:17.029 --> 23:19.365
I'm never opening the door
for a man again.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.200
(laughs)
Zenzi. Zenzi.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.704
She's quipping. She's fine.
You're fine? Okay.
Mm-hmm.

23:24.837 --> 23:27.139
Civil engineers,
how do we get out?

23:27.239 --> 23:29.241
There's a covalent bond serum
holding the doors closed.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.878
We'll need extreme heat
in order to destabilize it.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.348
How about a throwback?

23:47.326 --> 23:50.897
Barclay, on my mark,

23:51.030 --> 23:53.600
vibrate at 50 terahertz.

23:53.733 --> 23:58.004
Three, two, one!

23:58.104 --> 23:59.606
(grunts)

23:59.739 --> 24:02.408
(door glass shattering)
(indistinct chatter)

24:09.549 --> 24:12.451
I'm so proud of you.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.922
Mm. (laughs)

24:16.055 --> 24:17.590
I'm so proud of you.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.592
But listen,
we have an issue.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.227
I think Claire has been...

24:21.360 --> 24:22.461
Claire's been what?

24:22.595 --> 24:25.031
She's a problem.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.099
But we'll deal
with her tomorrow.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.400
We have two hours
before apogee.

24:28.535 --> 24:29.468
Can you still
launch the drone?

24:34.240 --> 24:38.444
Why should I save a man
who tried to destroy me?

24:40.412 --> 24:43.449
He never told you about
his little gummy bears?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.954
I prayed you'd never find out.

24:48.087 --> 24:51.257
How could you ask me
to do anything for that man

24:51.390 --> 24:52.959
when you know what
he tried to do to me?

24:53.092 --> 24:54.961
Because...

24:55.094 --> 24:57.129
Because he realized
he was wrong.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.965
And when I found out,
I told him

24:59.098 --> 25:01.433
if he ever tried anything like
that on my baby again,

25:01.568 --> 25:05.004
he would never see you,
me or Lino again.

25:06.472 --> 25:07.674
Look, trying to change you,

25:07.807 --> 25:09.809
it was the biggest regret
of his life.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.011
Oh, then why didn't he stop?

25:12.144 --> 25:13.813
That man was trying to change me

25:13.946 --> 25:15.848
until the day he got
on that damn ship.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.984
Look, the man had
his limitations.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.953
And his time on Earth,
it was, it was cut short

25:21.087 --> 25:23.522
before he was able
to evolve his thinking.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.524
But he was evolving.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.494
Do you think he would have
left you all of this

25:28.628 --> 25:30.496
if he didn't love you...

25:30.630 --> 25:32.131
believe in you?

25:33.600 --> 25:36.502
There is a world of people

25:36.636 --> 25:41.173
telling me how my father
felt about me,

25:41.307 --> 25:44.844
but ignoring how he
actually treated me.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.648
Parental love should not
be conditional.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.516
No, no, no, no, no.
I shouldn't have to prove

25:50.650 --> 25:54.186
that I'm worthy,
or-or forgive his shortcomings.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.689
It's not enough.

25:56.823 --> 26:00.526
He doesn't deserve it.

26:01.527 --> 26:05.131
Then be like your mother
and show some mercy.

26:05.231 --> 26:09.201
Grace is being given
things you don't deserve,

26:09.335 --> 26:12.371
and mercy is being spared
the things you do.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.540
You're not perfect either, Tom.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.009
You may need grace
someday, too.

26:21.380 --> 26:25.718
I love you both
unconditionally.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.557
And I am begging for
mercy and grace

26:31.691 --> 26:34.727
for Barton.

26:34.861 --> 26:38.230
He is my husband,
he is your father,

26:38.364 --> 26:40.667
and he is only human.

26:42.268 --> 26:46.405
So please save him
before it's too late.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.255
BARCLAY:
I triangulated the origin point

27:03.389 --> 27:04.757
of Susannah's video call.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.625
She should be headed this way.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.695
TOM:
Are you sure she's in a 200-yard
radius? I don't see her.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.930
Try locking onto
the capsule piece.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.099
She's approaching
the T-intersection now.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.101
Wait for it.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.469
Boom! Kobe!

27:17.603 --> 27:19.438
* I'm ridin' through the city
in the drop now *

27:19.571 --> 27:21.708
And she's got the capsule piece
in her backpack.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.076
* Got the AC up
'cause I'm hot now *

27:24.210 --> 27:26.245
* Take off, take off *

27:26.378 --> 27:27.646
* Are you ready
for the countdown? *

27:27.780 --> 27:30.049
* Moja, bimi *

27:30.149 --> 27:31.984
* Tattoo, twindelay *

27:32.118 --> 27:35.621
Girl, you lost!
Give me the capsule piece.

27:35.755 --> 27:38.257
* Go *

27:38.390 --> 27:40.092
* Uh, yeah, uh-huh *

27:40.226 --> 27:41.994
* Take off *

27:42.128 --> 27:44.630
* Uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah *

27:44.764 --> 27:46.132
* Take off *

27:46.265 --> 27:47.934
* Are you ready
for the bounce now? *

27:48.067 --> 27:49.802
* Are you ready
for the countdown? *

27:49.936 --> 27:51.603
* Uh, take off *

27:51.738 --> 27:53.806
Why take me on
a high-speed chase

27:53.940 --> 27:55.474
through Hudson Valley?

27:58.244 --> 27:59.311
She's leading me somewhere.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.148
Barclay,
run possible endpoints.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.416
There are several warehouses,
a shipping station,

28:04.516 --> 28:06.018
Brandon's house, ew.
And... uh-oh.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.520
Approaching Swift Enterprises
server farm.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.656
She can't hack that.
Baby, we got

28:10.790 --> 28:12.491
the best security
in the world.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.026
* Take off *

28:14.160 --> 28:16.162
* Uh-huh, yeah *

28:16.295 --> 28:18.364
* Take off, take off *

28:18.497 --> 28:21.700
* Whoo-oo, ow! *

28:21.834 --> 28:23.702
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

28:23.836 --> 28:26.372
* Come on, come on, come on *

28:26.505 --> 28:29.041
* I'm-a take off. *

28:47.459 --> 28:49.561
Last chance. Join us.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.630
Or I'll use
everything in my power

28:51.730 --> 28:53.199
to destroy your company
and anyone else

28:53.332 --> 28:54.801
who attempts
unmitigated progress.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.036
Joining you wouldn't help me.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.138
Money doesn't matter, Tom.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.573
The Road Back's
offering you power.

29:01.707 --> 29:04.643
Power. We are everywhere.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.846
In every city, every country,

29:06.979 --> 29:09.715
every part of government.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.852
Join us, and you and I will
control the world's fate.

29:16.322 --> 29:20.426
You just said that in front
of my five million followers.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.167
Say hey, Susie.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.069
Oh, and good luck on the whole
global conspiracy thing

29:30.202 --> 29:31.703
you spoke of, because after...

29:33.906 --> 29:36.242
Ooh, she mad.
You son of a bitch.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.111
You think you don't have
to face consequences?

29:39.245 --> 29:41.914
Why are we here, Tom?

29:42.048 --> 29:43.582
What is this building?

29:43.715 --> 29:46.953
You think I don't know?
It's Barclay.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.121
You know, you think
you're really smart,

29:49.255 --> 29:51.423
but you're just a rich kid
with a talking laptop.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.462
Shame about those
backups, though.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.264
TOM:
Deleting Barclay's backups,

29:58.397 --> 30:00.566
it freed up significant
additional memory.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.468
Barclay, when was your
last backup?

30:02.601 --> 30:05.437
BARCLAY:
All backup files were deleted
before dinner last--

30:08.975 --> 30:10.109
(chuckles)

30:10.242 --> 30:12.711
That's it?
Girl, that explosion was

30:12.811 --> 30:13.980
as flat as your bangs.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.748
See you soon, Tom.

30:28.928 --> 30:32.631
(explosion)

30:32.764 --> 30:34.133
(electricity crackling)

30:34.266 --> 30:37.003
Barclay!

30:41.573 --> 30:44.310
(Tom coughing)

30:44.443 --> 30:46.812
Barclay, status update.

30:46.946 --> 30:50.149
BARCLAY (distorted):
Tom, piece damaged.

30:50.282 --> 30:53.119
Circuitry destroyed.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.255
(gasping, coughing)

31:03.529 --> 31:04.964
Ah!

31:07.199 --> 31:09.835
Okay, okay, okay.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.007
(watch scanner humming)

31:15.141 --> 31:16.442
BARCLAY:
Data failing.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.010
You'll need to transfer
ten terabytes

31:18.144 --> 31:19.678
of the capsule data
to your watch cloud

31:19.811 --> 31:21.680
or your dad's coordinates
will be lost.

31:21.813 --> 31:24.150
Begin transfer now?
Pause. Uh...

31:24.283 --> 31:26.185
I-If I do that,
it'll delete your temp file

31:26.318 --> 31:27.886
from the watch cloud, Barclay.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.888
Okay.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.991
There's not enough room
for the both of you.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.994
You're going to have
to choose one of us.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.203
BARCLAY:
Tom, the corrupted data
has been restored.

31:44.336 --> 31:48.574
BARTON:
...and Tom, one more thing.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.909
Forgive me.

31:51.043 --> 31:55.881
I thought I had to force you
to be my vision of a man.

31:56.015 --> 31:59.518
But as I stand here
in this ship you built me,

31:59.651 --> 32:01.753
begging you to rescue me...

32:01.887 --> 32:04.056
I was a damn fool.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.660
You...

32:08.760 --> 32:10.829
exactly as you are,

32:10.929 --> 32:14.400
are the only person
who can save me.

32:14.533 --> 32:19.005
BARCLAY:
You need to capture
the capsule data now,

32:19.105 --> 32:21.907
before the circuitry melts.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.243
He doesn't deserve it.
He doesn't deserve it.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.611
He doesn't deserve it,

32:25.744 --> 32:26.745
he doesn't deserve it,
he doesn't...

32:30.382 --> 32:32.218
(exhales sharply)

32:34.753 --> 32:36.922
Mom was right.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.929
(voice breaking):
I'm sorry, Barclay.

32:45.431 --> 32:48.900
Transfer capsule data.
Delete temp file.

32:49.035 --> 32:51.637
BARCLAY:
Replacing myself with
the data upload.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.305
It's okay, Tom.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.274
You're gonna be ok--

32:58.577 --> 33:00.612
*

33:05.917 --> 33:07.886
(sighs)

33:07.986 --> 33:09.621
(sniffles)

33:10.589 --> 33:12.491
*

33:30.476 --> 33:32.111
Won't start without Barclay.

33:32.244 --> 33:35.314
I'll come back for you later,
Dani.

33:37.916 --> 33:39.118
You know my dad stored
his Cobra here

33:39.251 --> 33:40.486
and never let me drive it?

33:40.619 --> 33:41.653
We can work on
those daddy issues

33:41.787 --> 33:43.689
at literally any other time.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.360
This jet pack will bring
his escape pod home.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.296
Ready when you are, Tom.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.835
TOM:
Ah, Dunk Supremes.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.504
'Cause if you're gonna
show mercy,

33:58.637 --> 34:01.373
you might as well
look good doing it.

34:07.979 --> 34:11.850
Damn, I'm talking to myself,
not Barclay.

34:11.983 --> 34:15.354
Ah, this is gonna take
some getting used to.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.956
What about Susannah?
She's exposed.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.460
Won't be hearing from her
for a long time...

34:21.560 --> 34:24.029
if ever.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.831
Come on, come on, come on.

34:25.964 --> 34:28.033
(engine starts)
Ah! (chuckles)

34:28.167 --> 34:29.401
All right,
speeding to you now.

34:31.837 --> 34:33.705
(tires screech)

34:39.345 --> 34:41.380
*

34:52.524 --> 34:54.193
(engine shuts off, door opens)

35:02.534 --> 35:04.503
Glad you could join us.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.248
He's at a moon of Saturn.
Dione.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.584
Isaac, plug in
the following coordinates.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.286
Shouldn't Barclay do that?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.255
Barclay is...

35:23.389 --> 35:25.791
no longer with us.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.961
Initiating launch sequence.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.800
(whirring)

35:53.285 --> 35:55.454
Barclay's gone?

35:59.925 --> 36:02.794
His backups
were deleted.

36:02.928 --> 36:06.232
I might have some backups
on my cloud.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.801
From side-ho mode?
(both chuckle)

36:11.770 --> 36:15.241
He wouldn't be
all there, but...

36:15.341 --> 36:16.842
it's possible.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.411
Yeah.

36:20.579 --> 36:21.747
(beeping)

36:21.847 --> 36:25.651
Hey. Hey, I think
it's your dad.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.819
BARTON: Tom...
ISAAC: He's still alive!

36:27.953 --> 36:29.355
Now that his drone is in space,
we can use

36:29.488 --> 36:32.258
his communication servers;
I can talk to him.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.759
I'm going back
to the observatory.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.661
We have dedicated
satellite comms.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.829
Yeah, go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.998
(exhales sharply)

36:43.835 --> 36:45.871
(engine revs)

36:56.882 --> 36:59.551
Another light day
at Swift Enterprises.

36:59.685 --> 37:03.154
You did amazing today.
(laughs) Just today?

37:07.793 --> 37:09.528
(phone chimes)

37:13.899 --> 37:16.034
Oh, my God.
What?

37:16.167 --> 37:19.070
"A car belonging to
Congressman Nathan Eskol

37:19.204 --> 37:22.341
"was found in the Hudson River.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.876
"Bloodstains everywhere.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.548
No body has been found."

37:39.224 --> 37:41.893
LORRAINE:
You were drugging me

37:42.027 --> 37:43.729
into betraying my family.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.064
You were blinded by grief.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.066
In a way,
I was protecting you.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.769
I kept this company afloat
while you spiraled.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.738
I deserve some respect for that.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.706
You deserve nothing.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.377
You're fired, Claire.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.947
Uh...

38:09.555 --> 38:12.057
I don't think
you'll be firing me.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.932
You really like to talk
when you've got that gel on.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.369
So many secrets.

38:23.469 --> 38:27.205
Each of those cards contains
a recorded confession from you.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.240
What you did to win
that second custody battle

38:29.375 --> 38:31.777
with Violet over Lino?

38:33.712 --> 38:34.946
You wouldn't.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.051
I would tell the world.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.288
And I will,
if you make me.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.759
Now, let's talk about
your succession plan.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.082
(breathing unevenly)

39:15.454 --> 39:18.524
(link connects, powers up)

39:24.530 --> 39:26.297
Dad?

39:27.666 --> 39:32.137
I-I found the capsule
and I reassembled it.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.706
I-I sent a rescue drone,
and it should be there soon.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.444
Thank you.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.612
Thank you, son.

39:42.648 --> 39:46.151
I'm so sorry that
I ever doubted you.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.155
The way I treated you, I...

39:50.288 --> 39:52.524
You have changed.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.194
(sniffles)

39:56.327 --> 39:58.530
(hoarsely):
I forgive you.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.204
I am so proud of...

40:10.976 --> 40:12.343
The connection is gone.

40:12.478 --> 40:13.545
You won't be able to
contact him again.

40:13.679 --> 40:14.813
I severed the link.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.215
You did what? Why?!

40:17.348 --> 40:19.718
Because your father
told me to.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.387
That's why I planted
a jamming device.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.589
You did what?

40:23.722 --> 40:25.190
I know this is
hard to hear,

40:25.323 --> 40:27.092
but you have to
believe me, Tom.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.394
After Barton gets in
the rescue drone,

40:29.528 --> 40:31.229
he's going to encounter
a wormhole.

40:31.362 --> 40:33.331
Oh, a worm-- Okay, we can
bring him back to Earth

40:33.431 --> 40:35.767
and we can warn him...
You're wrong. You're wrong.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.504
His ship is already failing.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.739
He'll later realize that
if he hadn't gone

40:40.872 --> 40:42.207
through that wormhole,

40:42.340 --> 40:44.075
he would certainly have died.

40:44.209 --> 40:48.680
The wormhole will bring
him back to Earth, Tom,

40:48.780 --> 40:52.250
but not until the year 2096.

40:54.886 --> 40:57.188
I had to sever the link,

40:57.288 --> 40:59.124
otherwise you'd have
stopped him

40:59.257 --> 41:02.227
from going through it,
and he would be gone forever.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.964
You just saved
your father's life.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.066
Congratulations.

41:10.936 --> 41:14.573
You said...

41:14.706 --> 41:17.543
he told you to do it.

41:20.746 --> 41:23.281
How do you know my dad?

41:23.414 --> 41:27.218
I met him when
he crash-landed on Earth

41:27.318 --> 41:29.921
in 2096.

41:31.456 --> 41:34.125
I'm from the future, Tom.

41:34.259 --> 41:38.964
He sent me back to save him,
and to save you.
