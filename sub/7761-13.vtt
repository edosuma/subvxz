02:22.943 --> 02:25.779
FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.925
AND STOP TREATING ME

- SORRY,
BUT IT'S YOUR CHILD TOO.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.632
- THAT STILL DOESN'T GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT TO ORDER ME AROUND.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.501
- I WASN'T ORDERING YOU.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.703

TALKING TO ME ABOUT RIGHTS.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.439

IT'S GOING TO COST THEM,

07:02.956 --> 07:05.859

YOU'RE GOING TO L.A.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.760
- BUT I MADE A COMMITMENT.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.563
I HAVE SPONSORS, I RAISED MONEY.
- IF THE MOVIE GETS MADE,

07:42.596 --> 07:43.997
YOU CAN GIVE THEM
A MILLION BUCKS.

HEY, CARL.

TO HELP YOU FIGHT CRIME?

07:48.168 --> 07:51.872
- ACTUALLY, I'M LOOKING FOR YOU.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.974
WILL YOU EXCUSE US, JUSTIN?

07:54.007 --> 07:55.876
- YEAH, SURE.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.010
SEE YA.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.980
- BUY SOME SUN BLOCK.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.849

WHILE YOU INTERROGATE ME?

08:01.882 --> 08:04.852
- BE MY GUEST.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.987
- YOU WANT SOME?
- NO, THANKS.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.723

A LITTLE FUNNY.

08:09.757 --> 08:10.791
- SOMETHING WRONG?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.860
- IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.595
- I REALIZE SHE CAN BE
A LITTLE SPICY,

08:14.628 --> 08:16.263
BUT I'VE NEVER KNOWN HER
TO CAUSE INDIGESTION.

08:16.296 --> 08:19.667
- AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN
SEEING EACH OTHER A LOT LATELY.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.268
- I KNOW.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.271
- BUT IT CAN'T GO ON THIS WAY.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.740
- SUDDENLY I'M NOT FEELING
SO GOOD MYSELF.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.676
- NAH, IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.011
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,
I NEED SOMEONE IN MY LIFE

08:31.044 --> 08:33.647
WHO'LL MAKE ME LAUGH,
WHO'LL MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.883
- I'M ALREADY TAKEN, CARL.

08:35.916 --> 08:39.219
- THAT'S WHY I WANT TO MARRY
YOUR MOTHER.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.992
AS SOON AS YOU SAY "YOU MAY,"
I WANT HER TO SAY "I DO."

08:49.597 --> 08:51.732
- THAT'S...
THAT'S A BIG REQUEST.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.636
NORMALLY I ASK
FOR PERSONAL REFERENCES

08:55.669 --> 08:57.905
AND W-2 FORMS
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS

08:57.938 --> 09:01.108
AND AN ARREST REPORT.

09:01.141 --> 09:05.078
BUT IN YOUR CASE,
I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.787
DO YOU PROMISE...

09:13.821 --> 09:15.923
YOU'LL BE GOOD TO HER?

09:15.956 --> 09:18.692
- I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

09:21.629 --> 09:25.098
- THEN THE ANSWER IS,
YOU MAY.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.203
- I'M LIKE
HER EMOTIONAL PUNCHING BAG.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.705
SHE POUNDS AWAY AT ME ALL DAY,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.807
AND I JUST STAND THERE
AND TAKE IT.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.610
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
OLD KILLER MULDOON TO ME.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.212
- I HAVE NO CHOICE. HER DOCTOR
SAID SHE HAS TO STAY IN BED.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.015
NO STRESS.
- OH.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.884
SO NOW YOU HAVE
TO SERVE IN SILENCE

09:43.917 --> 09:46.086

THE MILITARY, GRETA CAMEMBERT.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.888

AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
LONGER I CAN PUT UP WITH IT.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.693
- WELL...
THEN DON'T.

09:52.726 --> 09:56.396
- BUT IT'S MY FAULT.
I'M THE ONE TO BLAME.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.866
- SO THEREFORE
YOU'RE BEATING YOURSELF UP.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.101
OR RATHER, LETTING MELANIE
DO IT FOR YOU.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.303
- OLD-FASHIONED
AS IT MAY SEEM,

10:03.336 --> 10:06.106
I STILL BELIEVE IN LOYALTY,
NOT BETRAYAL,

10:06.139 --> 10:08.842
SELF-CONTROL,
NOT SELF-INDULGENCE,

10:08.876 --> 10:11.011
EVEN IF I FAILED TO LIVE UP
TO MY OWN EXPECTATIONS.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.380
- TELL HER THAT.
- SHE REFUSES TO LISTEN.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.383
SHE THINKS BECAUSE I FUCKED SAM
THAT I'M NO LONGER A LESBIAN.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.318
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT A STICKLER
FOR DETAIL SHE IS.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.386
- BRIAN, PLEASE.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.389
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

10:22.422 --> 10:24.391
IF IT'S OVER,
GET THE HELL OUT.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.661
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.263
WHAT ABOUT GUS?
AND THE ONE ON THE WAY?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.265
- STAYING TOGETHER FOR THE SAKE
OF THE CHILDREN

10:32.299 --> 10:35.202
IS A FUCKING POOR EXCUSE.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.906
I PROUDLY OFFER MYSELF
AS EXHIBIT A.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.843
HEY, SONNY BOY.
COME HERE.

10:46.046 --> 10:51.284
- UNDIES, SWEATERS.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.886
COULD YOU HOLD THESE FOR ME
FOR A MINUTE?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.155
THANKS, HONEY.
- UH, DEBBIE, I-I...

10:55.188 --> 10:57.691
- CARL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY IT.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.426
I-I KNOW WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
BE GOING TO ST. PETE'S

10:59.459 --> 11:01.228
FOR A FEW DAYS, BUT...

11:01.261 --> 11:03.296
HELL, THIS IS...
THE RIDE'S FOR THE HOSPICE.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.033
HOW COULD I NOT DO MY BIT
AND VOLUNTEER?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.935
- YOU GOT A BIG HEART.
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.237
- BESIDES, IT'LL STILL BE THERE.
WE'LL GO ON OUR HONEYMOON.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.172
- WHAT?
- HA! I'M JOKING.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.709
HONEYMOON? US?

11:15.743 --> 11:18.445
OKAY, SO, UM, OH.
[clears throat]

11:18.478 --> 11:21.782
SO YOU, UH, YOU WANTED
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.450
GO AHEAD, I'M ALL EARS.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.319
- DEBBIE, HONEY...
- EARS. FUCK!

11:26.353 --> 11:28.722
I NEED EARMUFFS.

11:28.756 --> 11:34.327
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE COLDER
THAN A WITCH'S TIT IN CANADA.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.363
UH, SO GO AHEAD, HONEY,

11:36.396 --> 11:39.199
WHAT IS IT YOU WANTED TO SAY?

11:39.232 --> 11:41.234
- BE SURE TO BUNDLE UP.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.104
[doorbell chimes]

11:44.137 --> 11:45.472
- KEEP PACKING, DEB, OR...

11:45.505 --> 11:46.807
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE DOING IN THERE.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.975
I'LL GET IT.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.482
TEDDY.
- HEY, EM.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.483
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.351
- SO WHERE IS HE?

11:58.385 --> 12:01.855
- UH, SORRY, NOTHING LIKE THAT.
IT'S JUST, UH, THIS.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.757
IT'S THE $5,000 I OWE YOU
FOR COVERING FOR ME

12:03.791 --> 12:07.527
THAT TIME I "BORROWED" FROM
GUS' COLLEGE FUND.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.363
- I, UH...
THANK YOU, TEDDY.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.165
- I'M SURE YOU CAN USE IT.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.367
- I DON'T MEAN FOR THAT.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.103
I MEAN FOR KEEPING YOUR WORD.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.971
FOLLOWING THROUGH. HMM.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.973
YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.509
- YEAH, I GUESS I HAVE.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.177
- AND NOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO
EVEN FURTHER, HUH?

12:24.211 --> 12:25.779
THIS TIME ON A BIKE?

12:25.813 --> 12:28.381
- UH, ACTUALLY, I'VE, UH,
CHANGED MY MIND.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.117
I'M NOT GOING.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.919
- WHAT?

12:31.952 --> 12:34.321
- YEAH, I'M UP TO MY GARBANZOS
IN WORK.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.856
I CAN'T LEAVE BRIAN
WITH EVERYTHING.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.791
A-AND I JUST GOT
THESE NEW PLANTS,

12:37.825 --> 12:39.559
AND THEY'RE AT
THAT CRITICAL PHASE

12:39.592 --> 12:42.062
WHERE IF YOU DON'T WATCH THEM,
THEY COULD GO INTO SHOCK, SO.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.531
- I'M THE ONE WHO'S IN SHOCK.
YOU'VE BEEN TRAINING FOR WEEKS.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.533
- IT'S ONLY A BIKE RIDE.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.536
BESIDES, I'VE GOT
MY MEETINGS, MY GROUPS.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.271
- CAN'T YOU SKIP THEM
FOR A FEW DAYS?

12:51.304 --> 12:53.006
- [sighs]
WELL, THEY'RE WHAT'S GOTTEN ME

12:53.040 --> 12:54.474
THROUGH THESE PAST FEW MONTHS.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.909
I MEAN, THEY'VE BEEN
MY SUPPORT SYSTEM.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.578
BUT ON THE RIDE,
I'D BE ON MY OWN.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.313
I MEAN, SAY THERE'S A TRIGGER,

13:00.347 --> 13:02.916
THAT I SEE GUYS DOING DRUGS,
THAT I'M TEMPTED,

13:02.950 --> 13:05.552
WHERE CAN I GO?
WHO CAN I CALL?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.020
I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE
OF THAT HAPPENING,

13:07.054 --> 13:09.489
OF BECOMING THAT PERSON AGAIN.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.459
THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.297
[door closes]

13:17.330 --> 13:20.467
- GEARS LUBED UP,
SEAT NICE AND TIGHT.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.469
- I'M GOING TO RIDE IT,
NOT FUCK IT.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.907
- WOW!

13:26.940 --> 13:29.076
THAT IS ONE COOL BIKE.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.044
- YEAH. HUNTER NEEDED A NEW ONE
FOR THE LIBERTY RIDE.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.580
- CAN I TAKE IT OUT FOR A SPIN?
PLEASE, DAD, PLEASE.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.215
- SURE, SON.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.950
- JUST DON'T BE LATE FOR DINNER.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.953
I'M MAKING YOUR FAVORITE,
BLUEBERRY CRUMBLE.

13:44.624 --> 13:48.061
- SO, HOW WERE THINGS
AT WORK, DEAR?

13:48.095 --> 13:50.463
- LET'S SEE. HMM.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.464
I FINISHED
THE LATEST ADVENTURE OF RAGE.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.100
- HEY.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.003
- MADE 600 BUCKS IN SALES
ON THE WEBSITE.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.504
- HMM.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.507
- OH, AND CARL HORVATH
WANTS TO MARRY MY MOTHER.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.644
- WHAT?

14:04.677 --> 14:09.616
- HE ACTUALLY ASKED ME
FOR HER HAND.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.252
- DID YOU GIVE IT TO HIM?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.653
- EVERY LAST DIGIT.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.989
AFTER ALL,
THAT'S WHAT TWO PEOPLE DO

14:16.023 --> 14:18.425
WHEN THEY LOVE EACH OTHER,
RIGHT, GET MARRIED?

14:31.271 --> 14:33.106
- WHAT THE FUCK'S ALL THIS?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.642
- JUST MAKING SURE WE HAVE
EVERYTHING WE NEED FOR THE RIDE.

14:35.675 --> 14:40.147
TENT, SLEEPING BAGS, FIRST AID
KIT, TOOL KIT, RAIN GEAR,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.682
TWO SETS OF WARM CLOTHES,
ONE DILDO.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.018
- YOU CERTAINLY THOUGHT
OF EVERYTHING.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.121
BUT WHY DO YOU NEED A TENT

14:48.155 --> 14:49.689
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE STAYING
IN A MANSION?

14:49.722 --> 14:52.525
HMM?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.661
MICHAEL TOLD ME YOU'RE WINGING
TO THE COAST TOMORROW

14:54.694 --> 14:56.029
TO HUDDLE WITH STUDIO HEADS.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.131
- I NEVER SAID I WAS GOING.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.666
- HE SEEMS TO THINK
THAT YOU ARE.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.368
- WELL, I'M NOT.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.305
WE'RE GOING ON THE RIDE
TOGETHER, AS PLANNED.

15:05.338 --> 15:09.176
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S
BEEN A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.677
I'M NOT GOING.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.412
- WHY THE FUCK NOT?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.447
- BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.349
I'M NOT IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.151
- I SAW YOU CYCLING.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.020
- YEAH, AND AFTER 30 MILES,
I WAS WINDED.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.488
ON THE RIDE WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO

15:21.521 --> 15:24.491
80 TO 100 MILES A DAY,
MAYBE MORE.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.159
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAKE IT.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.727
- THAT IS BULLSHIT.
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT

15:27.760 --> 15:30.230
TO GET ME TO GO TO HOLLYWOOD.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.599
- THEN GO ON THE RIDE
WITHOUT ME.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.202
SACRIFICE YOUR FUTURE.

15:35.235 --> 15:39.973
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
CHARITY.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.941
[water running]

15:44.344 --> 15:47.314
- NOW HERE'S
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER.

15:47.347 --> 15:51.318
AND HERE'S BEN'S CELL PHONE
NUMBER.

15:51.351 --> 15:55.488
HERE'S HUNTER'S
CELL PHONE NUMBER.

15:55.522 --> 15:59.492
AND HERE'S THE NUMBER
FOR OUR HOTEL IN TORONTO.

15:59.526 --> 16:04.131
- CHRIST, I'LL BE TOO BUSY
CALLING YOU TO GIVE BIRTH.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.598
- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T GO.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.534
- MICHAEL, THE BABY'S
NOT DUE FOR WEEKS.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.003
- IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS...
- NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.105
BELIEVE ME, I'LL BE
SCREAMING FROM BOREDOM

16:12.139 --> 16:13.340
LONG BEFORE I'LL BE
SCREAMING FROM LABOR.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.741
- SO GO AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.609
IT'LL BE AN AMAZING ADVENTURE.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.611
- I JUST WISH I COULD BE THERE
TO SEE YOU GUYS OFF.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.349
- YOU STAY RIGHT HERE.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.752
AND REMEMBER, IF YOU NEED
TO GET AHOLD OF ME...

16:25.785 --> 16:28.021
- WE KNOW, MICHAEL.
WE KNOW.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.230
- NOW WOULD YOU GET
THE FUCK OUT OF HERE?

16:37.264 --> 16:40.267
- WE LOVE YOU.
- WE LOVE YOU.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.636
- WHAT A LUCKY KID...

16:43.670 --> 16:47.407
TO BE COMING INTO
SUCH A WARM AND LOVING HOME.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.716
[door opens and closes]

17:08.295 --> 17:11.531
- 50 TUNA SANDWICHES,
50 HAM AND CHEESE,

17:11.564 --> 17:14.534
50 CHICKEN SALAD,
50 ROAST BEEF.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.703
- OH, ROAST BEEF'S
TEDDY'S FAVORITE.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.471
BETTER MAKE THAT 49.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.607
- IT'S A DAMN SHAME
HE DECIDED NOT TO GO.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.409
WOULD'VE BEEN GOOD FOR HIM.
GIVEN HIM A VICTORY.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.144
SOME SELF-ESTEEM.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.614
- HE'S TOO AFRAID TO LEAVE
HIS MEETINGS AND GROUPS,

17:27.647 --> 17:30.183
YOU KNOW, THAT WITHOUT
HIS SUPPORT SYSTEM, HE'LL SLIP.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.719
HE'S AS ADDICTED TO THEM
AS HE WAS TO THE CRYSTAL METH.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.422
- WELL, AT LEAST IT'S
A HEALTHY ADDICTION, HUH?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.657
TOO BAD HE CAN'T TAKE
HIS SUPPORT SYSTEM WITH HIM.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.195
HEY, CARL.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.430
HONEY, HI.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.298
CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN A BOX LUNCH?

17:45.332 --> 17:48.601
IT'S FOR THE BUS TRIP TO
TORONTO, BUT I GOT AN EXTRA.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.570
- THANKS, I--
UH, I ALREADY ATE.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.239
- WELL, YOU WANT TO LEND A HAND?
EM...

17:52.272 --> 17:53.506
GIVE CARL SOME FRUIT.
SHOW HIM HOW IT'S DONE.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.775
- YOU TAKE AN APPLE
OR AN ORANGE.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.179
YOU DROP IT INTO THE BOX
COMME CA.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.381
THEN YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT.
GOT IT?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.882
- THANKS FOR THE TRAINING.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.651
DEB, COULD YOU STOP
FOR A SECOND? HONEY...

18:04.684 --> 18:06.519
- CARL, I'M UP TO MY ASS
IN HARD-BOILED EGGS.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.654
DO YOU MIND IF WE TALK LATER?

18:07.687 --> 18:11.324
- [sighs]
SURE. NO HURRY.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.626
WE'LL TALK WHEN YOU GET BACK.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.632
- THANK YOU, BABY.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.868
BYE, HONEY.
- BYE.

18:21.901 --> 18:25.205
- LUPE.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.907
[sing-song]
COME OUT, LUPE.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.509
[knock at door]

18:29.542 --> 18:32.379
COME IN.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.647
COME ON, PUSS. BE A GOOD PUSS.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.349
COME ON NOW.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.650
COME ON, PUSS-PUSS.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.219
- WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.621
- LUPE. COME ON,
PUSS, PUSS, PUSS, PUSS.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.490
- YEAH, YOUR CLEANING LADY'S
NEVER GOING TO COME OUT

18:43.523 --> 18:44.824
IF YOU TALK TO HER LIKE THAT.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.759
- LUPE'S MY CAT.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.362
- YOU GOT A CAT?

18:49.396 --> 18:51.164
- YEAH, I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE

18:51.198 --> 18:53.300
TO HAVE SOMETHING WARM
AND PURRING TO COME HOME TO.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.501
- HMM, AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

18:54.534 --> 18:55.568
- THE MINUTE I BROUGHT HER IN,

18:55.602 --> 18:57.270
SHE RAN STRAIGHT
FOR THE BEDROOM.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.172
- HMM, A FELINE
AFTER MY OWN HEART.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.840
- AND NOW SHE'S HIDING
IN THE CLOSET.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.443
- WELL, SHE'LL COME OUT
IN HER OWN TIME,

19:03.476 --> 19:05.678
JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.
MEANWHILE, COME.

19:05.712 --> 19:09.649
CONCENTRATE ON
MY CRASS CONSUMERISM.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.785
SPANDEX AS FAR
AS THE EYE CAN SEE,

19:12.819 --> 19:15.388
IN EVERY COLOR OF THE RAINBOW.

19:15.422 --> 19:18.791
A DIFFERENT ENSEMBLE FOR
EVERY DAY OF THE LIBERTY RIDE.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.327
- THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL
OF YOU, EM.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.661
NOT TO MENTION EXTRAVAGANT.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.662
BUT I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT GOING.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.331
- WHO SAID IT'S FOR YOU?

19:24.364 --> 19:25.698
- WHO ELSE?

19:25.732 --> 19:28.201
- ME. I DECIDED TO GO.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.936
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE
TOO BUSY WORKING.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.338
- WELL, THE BUSHES WILL
HAVE TO PLAN

19:31.371 --> 19:33.273
THEIR NEXT STATE DINNER
WITHOUT ME.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.941
- THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY
FOR THE REGISTRATION FEE.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.545
- A VERY GOOD FRIEND
JUST PAID ME BACK.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.347
- THAT YOU WERE AFRAID OF
BEING EATEN BY A BEAR.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.817
- WELL, AT LEAST THE KIND THAT
LIVE IN THE WILDS OF CANADA.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.420
BUT I'M WILLING TO CONFRONT
MY DARKEST FEARS

19:47.454 --> 19:51.491
FOR A WORTHY CAUSE,
SUCH AS HELPING A FRIEND...

19:51.524 --> 19:52.959
BEING HIS SUPPORT SYSTEM,

19:52.992 --> 19:56.863
SEEING HIM THROUGH ANY CRISIS,
GREAT OR SMALL.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.967
- YOU'D REALLY DO THAT FOR ME?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.902
- I BELIEVE IN YOU, TEDDY.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.437
DESPITE EVERYTHING.

20:04.471 --> 20:09.376
I, UH, I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.945
THINK I'LL SAVE THE TANGERINE
FOR THE FINISH LINE. HMM?

20:15.415 --> 20:18.518
[cheering]

20:18.551 --> 20:23.356
all: LIBERTY RIDE, LIBERTY RIDE,
GO, LIBERTY RIDE!

20:23.390 --> 20:24.791
[cheers and applause]

20:24.824 --> 20:27.527
- THE CENTER THANKS
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

20:27.560 --> 20:29.729
FOR PUTTING FORTH
THIS WONDERFUL EFFORT

20:29.762 --> 20:33.333
TO BENEFIT
LIBERTY HOUSE HOSPICE.

20:33.366 --> 20:37.003
- WE WISH YOU ALL
A GREAT JOURNEY UP TO TORONTO,

20:37.036 --> 20:39.372
AND A SAFE RIDE
BACK TO PITTSBURGH.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.940
MAY THIS BE THE ADVENTURE
OF A LIFETIME.

20:40.973 --> 20:45.412
[cheering]

20:45.445 --> 20:48.348
- PLEASE MAKE SURE
YOUR BIKES ARE ON THE TRUCK.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.816
- THERE YOU GO, HONEY.
IT'S SALAMI.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.751
I'M AFRAID WE'RE OUT OF TUNA.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.620
- THANK YOU.
- THERE YOU GO.

20:53.653 --> 20:56.356
I'M SO PROUD OF ALL OF YOU
FOR DOING THIS.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.890
THERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART.
- THANK YOU.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.058

20:59.091 --> 21:02.795
- THANKS, DEB.
- HI, HONEY...

21:02.829 --> 21:04.831
- ALL SET.
LET'S GET ON BOARD.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.566
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ON A BUS
SINCE NINTH GRADE.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.901
GUYS WOULD BE GETTING BLOWJOBS
IN THE BACK.

21:08.935 --> 21:13.440
- AH, THE GOOD OLD DAYS
OF JUNIOR HIGH.

21:13.473 --> 21:17.043
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T PAPA BEAR
AND MAMA BEAR AND BABY BEAR.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.911
- BRIAN!

21:18.945 --> 21:20.913
- JUST THOUGHT I'D STOP BY TO
REMIND YOU TO WEAR YOUR HELMETS,

21:20.947 --> 21:22.515
STAY TO THE RIGHT,

21:22.549 --> 21:25.051
AND BE SURE TO
USE YOUR HAND GESTURES.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.653
- THANKS FOR ALL
THE MOTHERLY ADVICE,

21:26.686 --> 21:28.855
BUT MY MOTHER'S GOING WITH ME.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.391
I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.793
- HEY, HAVE A GREAT TRIP,
YOU GUYS.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.795
- MEL, WHAT A SURPRISE.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.930
I HEARD YOU'D BEEN SPENDING
MOST OF YOUR TIME IN BED.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.399
- LIVING THE LIFE OF BRIAN.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.700
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:40.733 --> 21:42.435
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO--

21:42.469 --> 21:44.070
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR--
- NO, I'M NOT OUT OF MY...

21:44.103 --> 21:45.705
I JUST CAME DOWN TO SEE YOU
OFF, THAT'S ALL.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.441
SO STOP WORRYING.
I'M FINE.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.976
- JUST DON'T
LET MY MOM SEE YOU.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.578
YOU KNOW HOW HYSTERICAL
SHE GETS.

21:51.611 --> 21:54.714
- YOUR MOM? RIGHT.

21:54.747 --> 21:58.351
[indistinct chatter]

22:01.421 --> 22:03.923
- WE MADE JUST ENOUGH LUNCHES.

22:08.895 --> 22:12.098
I GUESS HE'S NOT COMING, HONEY.

22:12.131 --> 22:17.103
- I THOUGHT I'D CONVINCED HIM
TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

22:17.136 --> 22:20.473
- MICHAEL! GET YOUR ASSES
ON BOARD, YOU GUYS.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.943
COME ON.
AND SAVE ME A SEAT.

22:28.615 --> 22:32.485
COMING?

22:32.519 --> 22:35.888
[engine revs]
- DEBBIE!

22:35.922 --> 22:38.725
- CARL!

22:38.758 --> 22:40.026
SWEET OF YOU TO COME DOWN HERE.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.027
I TOLD YOU YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.662
- YES, I DID.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.498
I COULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT...
TELLING YOU...

22:45.532 --> 22:46.866
- MA, WOULD YOU GET ON THE BUS?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.635
- I GOTTA GO.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.037
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET THERE.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.905
- CAN YOU WAIT A GODDAMN MINUTE?

22:52.939 --> 22:55.908
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO ASK YOU
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.511
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

22:58.545 --> 23:00.012
- WHAT?

23:00.046 --> 23:04.484
- I SAID, MARRY ME.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.820
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

23:18.565 --> 23:22.201
- TELL HIM YES,
AND GET ON THE BUS.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.037
- YES.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.039
YES.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.176
OF COURSE I'LL MARRY YOU.

23:30.209 --> 23:33.112
FUCK!

23:48.094 --> 23:50.697
[cheering]

23:56.235 --> 23:58.705
BYE.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.111
BYE.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.920
[cheers and applause]

24:17.023 --> 24:18.958
[indistinct chatter]

24:18.991 --> 24:20.226
- KEEP THE CHANGE.

24:20.259 --> 24:24.096
THANK YOU.

24:24.130 --> 24:28.568
SHIT! HEY.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.771
HEY!

24:31.804 --> 24:33.239
HEY!

24:33.272 --> 24:34.707
- STOP--STOP THE BUS!

24:34.741 --> 24:36.108
STOP THE FUCKING BUS!

24:36.142 --> 24:38.811
- HEY! HEY!
[horn honking]

24:47.787 --> 24:50.056
THANK YOU.

24:57.764 --> 25:01.601
MADE IT.
- KNEW YOU WOULD.

25:11.978 --> 25:15.815
- WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?

25:15.848 --> 25:16.949
I COME HOME,
YOU'RE NOT HERE,

25:16.983 --> 25:18.685
I LOOK EVERYWHERE,
FRANTIC.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.286
I WAS ABOUT
TO CALL THE HOSPITAL,

25:20.319 --> 25:21.954
THE POLICE, THE MORGUE.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.023
I THOUGHT SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAD HAPPENED.

25:24.056 --> 25:27.960
- WOULD YOU CALM DOWN?
- NO, I WILL NOT CALM DOWN.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.229
YOU SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

25:30.262 --> 25:33.165
- I'M SORRY.
- OH, I CAN TELL.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.935
- I WENT TO
THE LIBERTY RIDE SEND-OFF.

25:35.968 --> 25:38.104
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

25:38.137 --> 25:41.107
AFTER EVERYONE TOLD YOU...

25:41.140 --> 25:42.308
TO SPITE ME?

25:42.341 --> 25:44.577
- [scoffs]

25:44.611 --> 25:46.312
THAT'S RIGHT, HONEY.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.315
MAKE IT ALL ABOUT YOU,
AS USUAL.

25:49.348 --> 25:52.184
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAS
A RIGHT TO BE ANGRY,

25:52.218 --> 25:55.187
TO BE INDIGNANT,
TO FEEL BETRAYED.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.956
WELL, GUESS WHAT,
MY SHIKSA GODDESS.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.825
- YOU DON'T CALL ME THAT.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.628
- THIS TIME IT ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.062
IT'S ABOUT ME.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.698
I WENT OUT BECAUSE
IF I STAYED IN THIS HOUSE

26:05.732 --> 26:07.333
ANOTHER MINUTE WITH YOU,

26:07.366 --> 26:11.804
I'D GO OUT OF MY FUCKING MIND.

26:11.838 --> 26:13.940
SO I LEFT,
FOR TEN MINUTES.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.208
OKAY, 1/2 HOUR, TOPS.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.344
I DROVE OVER TO LIBERTY AVENUE,

26:18.377 --> 26:20.246
SAID MY GOOD-BYES,
AND DROVE BACK.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.348
AND LOOK. HERE I AM.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.885
MIRACLE OF MIRACLES,
ALIVE AND STILL IN ONE PIECE.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.973
- [sighs]

26:47.006 --> 26:50.743
WE CAN'T GO ON DOING
THE ALL-FEMALE VERSION

26:50.777 --> 26:55.748
OF WHO'S AFRAID
OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?

26:55.782 --> 27:00.987
IT'S JUST TOO EXHAUSTING.

27:01.020 --> 27:04.123
YOU CAN'T FORGIVE ME,

27:04.156 --> 27:07.259
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I APOLOGIZE

27:07.293 --> 27:10.396
AND TRY TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

27:10.429 --> 27:14.300
AND I'M STARTING
NOT TO CARE.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.904
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
HOW MANY TIMES

27:17.937 --> 27:19.405
CAN SOMEONE REJECT YOU

27:19.438 --> 27:23.776
BEFORE YOU FINALLY
JUST GIVE UP?

27:26.478 --> 27:29.315
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

27:35.788 --> 27:39.759
- THAT PERHAPS IT'S BEST...

27:39.792 --> 27:42.328
FOR BOTH OF US...

27:42.361 --> 27:46.332
AND FOR GUS AND THE BABY...

27:49.235 --> 27:52.972
IF WE AREN'T TOGETHER.

27:55.942 --> 28:00.046
THAT WE STOP PUTTING EACH OTHER
THROUGH NEEDLESS HELL,

28:00.079 --> 28:04.450
TRYING TO REPAIR SOMETHING
WHICH OBVIOUSLY CAN'T BE FIXED.

28:04.483 --> 28:09.088
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:19.098 --> 28:24.904
- I'LL STAY
UNTIL AFTER THE BABY'S BORN.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.476
- HOW IS THE LUNCH?

28:30.509 --> 28:34.246
I MADE IT WITH
MY OWN TWO HANDS.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.883
HOW ABOUT THOSE LEMON BARS,
HUH?

28:36.916 --> 28:38.985
AREN'T THEY TO DIE FOR?

28:39.018 --> 28:41.954
- MA, WOULD YOU SIT DOWN
AND STOP SHOWING OFF?

28:41.988 --> 28:43.355
- I'M ALLOWED.
HOW MANY TIMES IN YOUR LIFE

28:43.389 --> 28:45.091
DO YOU GET AN ENGAGEMENT RING?

28:45.124 --> 28:46.893
- ELIZABETH TAYLOR, EIGHT TIMES,
TWICE FROM RICHARD BURTON.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.095
JENNIFER LOPEZ, THREE.
JULIA ROBERTS, FOUR.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.097
- THANK YOU.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.499
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.968
WHEN A MAN GIVES YOU A RING,
IT'S SPECIAL.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.369
IT'S MEANINGFUL.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.906
- WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.877
- THEN MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU FOUND OUT.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.813
- FOUND OUT WHAT?

29:10.817 --> 29:13.786
- MICHAEL NOVOTNY...

29:13.820 --> 29:17.756
YOU ARE THE MAN I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR ALL MY LIFE.

29:21.227 --> 29:25.164
I AM SO VERY BLESSED
TO HAVE FOUND YOU.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.569
WHICH IS WHY I'M ASKING YOU...

29:30.602 --> 29:35.074
TO DO ME THE HONOR...

29:35.107 --> 29:39.778
OF ACCEPTING MY HAND
IN MARRIAGE.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.550
WE'RE GOING TO TORONTO,

29:44.583 --> 29:46.886
WHERE GAY MARRIAGE
IS NOT ONLY ACCEPTED,

29:46.919 --> 29:48.554
IT'S...IT'S LEGAL.

29:48.587 --> 29:52.825
AND...
LIKE YOU SAID,

29:52.859 --> 29:55.094
THAT'S WHAT TWO PEOPLE DO WHEN
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

29:56.495 --> 29:59.565
- I...

29:59.598 --> 30:02.034
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--
WHAT TO SAY.

30:02.068 --> 30:05.972
- "YES" WOULD BE GOOD.

30:12.611 --> 30:16.949
- EVERYONE, A TOAST
TO MY FRIEND MALCOLM.

30:16.983 --> 30:19.351
[cheering]

30:25.491 --> 30:27.927
all: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

30:27.960 --> 30:32.598
- WHOO!

30:32.631 --> 30:35.434
- HEY, JUSTIN.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.072
WELL, I COULD GIVE YOU A LINE

30:40.106 --> 30:41.941
THE PARTY'S
TO WELCOME YOU TO L.A.

30:41.974 --> 30:45.077
BUT IT'S A BIRTHDAY BASH
FOR MY FRIEND, MALCOLM.

30:45.111 --> 30:49.615
HE JUST WON AN OSCAR
FOR SCORING HIS FIRST FILM.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.617
- YOUR HOUSE IS AMAZING.

30:51.650 --> 30:56.956
- YEAH. I CALL IT THE HOUSE
THAT V MEN BUILT.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.425
SOON YOU'LL HAVE A HOUSE
THAT RAGE BUILT.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.962
JOSEPH, MR. TAYLOR WILL BE
STAYING WITH US FOR A FEW DAYS.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.230
WOULD YOU TAKE HIS BAG
TO THE GUEST HOUSE?

31:04.263 --> 31:08.000
- MM-HMM.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.039
- I HAVE A BUTLER.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.640
JUST LIKE BRUCE WAYNE.

31:14.673 --> 31:18.310
[chuckles]

31:18.344 --> 31:19.912
- HEY, KEN, HOW'S IT GOING?

31:19.946 --> 31:21.180
- GREAT, BRETT.

31:21.213 --> 31:26.919
- NOW, LET'S GET YOU A DRINK.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.922
THE MEETING'S ALL SET
FOR THURSDAY AT THE STUDIO.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.324
WE'LL GO BY MY OFFICE TOMORROW.

31:32.358 --> 31:35.995
I'LL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE
STORYBOARDS WE'VE COME UP WITH.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.297
- BRETTSKI.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.204
- HEY, CON, I THOUGHT YOU
COULDN'T MAKE IT?

31:45.237 --> 31:47.940
- JUST GOT BACK FROM LOCATION.

31:47.974 --> 31:51.077
- THIS IS JUSTIN TAYLOR.
HE CREATED RAGE.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.612
- LET ME TELL YOU, BRETT'S
OBSESSED WITH YOUR COMIC.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.214
- JUSTIN, THIS IS CONNOR JAMES.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.016
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.484
- CALLS HIMSELF AN ACTOR.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.019
- A FEW OTHERS DO TOO.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.287
- INCLUDING ME.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.055
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.
- THANKS.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.024
- WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
OF CON FOR RAGE?

32:05.057 --> 32:08.627
- HE...
I MEAN, YOU WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

32:08.660 --> 32:11.630
- GET ME A SCRIPT
WHEN YOU HAVE IT.

32:18.004 --> 32:23.109
[indistinct chatter]

32:23.142 --> 32:24.977
- IS HE...?
- OF COURSE NOT.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.712
CONNOR'S AS STRAIGHT
AS THEY COME.

32:26.745 --> 32:29.548
HE'S OUT BANGING BITCHES
EVERY NIGHT.

32:44.163 --> 32:47.066
- THERE'S THE CN TOWER.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.501
- AND THAT'S THE SKYDOME.
- ALL VERY SCENIC.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.137
BUT THE ONE SITE ONE
MUSTN'T MISS

32:51.170 --> 32:54.406
WHILE VISITING TORONTO IS...
CHURCH STREET.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.075
ACCORDING TO THE DAMRON GUIDE,

32:56.108 --> 32:58.277
"IT'S THE CENTER
OF TORONTO GAY LIFE.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.080
"FROM ITS COLORFUL
NEIGHBORHOOD BAR, MOOSIE'S,

33:01.113 --> 33:04.083
TO ITS THUMPA-THUMPA
DANCE CLUB, GOMORRAH."

33:04.116 --> 33:06.418
- OH, LET'S GO TO GOMORRAH.
SOUNDS HOT.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.420
- PROBABLY THE ONLY PLACE
IN TORONTO THAT IS.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.089
I'M FRIGGING FREEZING.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.623
- YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING
TO THINK I'M CRAZY,

33:11.657 --> 33:13.292
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS STREET
REMINDS ME OF?

33:13.325 --> 33:15.294
all: LIBERTY AVENUE.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.430
- LEATHER DADDIES, TWINKS,
BEARS, DRAG QUEENS.

33:18.464 --> 33:21.300
- IT'S ALL PRETTY MUCH THE SAME,
WHEREVER YOU GO.

33:21.333 --> 33:25.771
all: SORRY, SORRY, SORRY,
SORRY, SORRY.

33:25.804 --> 33:27.573
- EXCEPT HERE EVERYBODY'S
SO FUCKING POLITE AND REFINED,

33:27.606 --> 33:29.408
YOU COULD SHIT.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.776
- HEY, HERE'S MOOSIE'S.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.511
- GOOD. LET'S GO IN HERE
AND GET WARM.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.046
- FIRST ROUND'S ON ME.
- WAIT.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.514
- YOU'LL HAVE A CANADA DRY.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.716
- AND IF ANYONE ASKS YOU
HOW OLD YOU ARE...

33:37.749 --> 33:39.251
- I'LL JUST SAY
WHAT I USED TO SAY:

33:39.285 --> 33:41.153
"HOW OLD WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO BE?"

33:41.187 --> 33:43.189
- GOMORRAH IS
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.590
WE'LL GO THERE LATER
AFTER WE'VE BEEN HERE.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.159
- OKAY. COME ON.

33:51.563 --> 33:55.201
- THANKS.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.602
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

33:56.635 --> 33:59.205
BUT I'M HAVING A GAY-JA VU.
- YOU TOO?

33:59.238 --> 34:00.472
- MAKE IT THREE.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.241
- IT REALLY REMINDS ME OF...

34:02.274 --> 34:03.275
all: WOODY'S.

34:03.309 --> 34:04.543
- YEAH.
- YES.

34:04.576 --> 34:05.844
- AND THE STRANGEST THING
OF ALL IS

34:05.877 --> 34:08.280
I KEEP EXPECTING BRIAN
TO WALK IN.

34:08.314 --> 34:10.549
- UH, MOLSON'S.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.351
- BRIAN!

34:12.384 --> 34:13.552
- CALM DOWN.
- HEY!

34:13.585 --> 34:15.821
- KEEP YOUR PANTS ON,
OR NOT.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.556
- HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

34:17.589 --> 34:20.092
- MIKEY, DID NO ONE
EVER TELL YOU?

34:20.126 --> 34:22.561
IN 1903, AT KITTY HAWK
IN NORTH CAROLINA,

34:22.594 --> 34:25.697
THE WRIGHT BROTHERS INVENTED
THIS THING CALLED FLIGHT.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.166
- FLIGHT.
- RIGHT.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.567
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:28.600 --> 34:31.337
- THE LIBERTY RIDE BEGINS HERE,
AM I CORRECT?

34:31.370 --> 34:32.871
- SO YOU CAME TO CHEER US ON?

34:32.904 --> 34:33.872
- EXACTLY, PROFESSOR.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.874
I CASHED IN 25,000 TRAVEL MILES

34:35.907 --> 34:37.709
SO I COULD COME HERE
AND BE YOUR CHEERLEADER.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.478
NO. I'M GOING ON THE RIDE.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.181
I'LL BE BUSTING A NUT
FOR CHARITY, SAME AS YOU.

34:42.214 --> 34:45.217
- THE NATIVES ARE SO FRIENDLY.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.885
THIS IS JEAN-CLAUDE.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.455
HE'S FRENCH-CANADIAN.

34:49.488 --> 34:50.722
- BONSOIR.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.259
- HI. BONSOIR.
- BONSOIR.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.327
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT?

34:55.361 --> 34:56.895
J.C. HERE HAS VERY KINDLY
OFFERED TO SHOW ME

34:56.928 --> 35:02.568
HOW CANADIANS KEEP WARM
AT NIGHT.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.336
BUT I SAID...
[clears throat]

35:04.370 --> 35:06.372
SORRY, JEAN-CLAUDE, UM,

35:06.405 --> 35:08.374
BUT, UH, AS MUCH AS
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO,

35:08.407 --> 35:10.609
I'M HERE WITH MY FRIEND TED.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.211
SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO SHOW
SOMEONE ELSE

35:12.244 --> 35:15.247
HOW TO RUB TWO STICKS TOGETHER.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.217
AU REVOIR, MON AMI.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.218
- SALUT.

35:19.251 --> 35:21.653
- BYE.
- BYE.

35:21.687 --> 35:26.225
*

35:26.258 --> 35:28.227
[whooping]

35:28.260 --> 35:30.762
- HEY!

35:30.796 --> 35:32.364
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:32.398 --> 35:33.665
- OH, IT'S A STAG
FOR ROGER AND DENNIS.

35:33.699 --> 35:34.666
THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.668
BEEN TOGETHER 32 YEARS.

35:36.702 --> 35:44.676
*

36:16.342 --> 36:19.411
- [gagging]

36:19.445 --> 36:22.881
[crowd cheering]

36:27.586 --> 36:29.355
- I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED TO COME,

36:29.388 --> 36:31.290
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW IN THE HELL
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT.

36:31.323 --> 36:34.326
- OH, I MIGHT JUST SURPRISE YOU.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.996
- THANKS, BUT I'VE HAD
ENOUGH SURPRISES.

36:38.029 --> 36:42.434
BEN PROPOSED.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.471
- PROPOSED WHAT?
- MARRIAGE.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.574
IT'S LEGAL FOR US TO
GET MARRIED HERE IN TORONTO.

36:48.607 --> 36:52.844
- I BELIEVE I READ THAT
SOMEWHERE.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.880
WELL, I HOPE WHILE HE WAS
DOWN ON HIS KNEES,

36:54.913 --> 36:56.982
HE DID SOMETHING USEFUL.

36:57.015 --> 36:59.351
- IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND HEARTFELT.

36:59.385 --> 37:02.454
- I'M SURE.

37:02.488 --> 37:04.323
BUT YOU DECLINED, OF COURSE,

37:04.356 --> 37:06.492
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN,
YOU STILL LOVE ME BEST.

37:06.525 --> 37:11.330
- SHUT UP.

37:11.363 --> 37:15.367
I DIDN'T GIVE HIM
AN ANSWER YET.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.002
- WELL, WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

37:17.035 --> 37:19.338
BESIDES THE FACT THAT
IT'S THE MOST PATHETIC IDEA

37:19.371 --> 37:20.739
I'VE EVER HEARD?
- IT JUST SO HAPPENS

37:20.772 --> 37:22.408
THAT A LOT OF GAY MEN
WANT TO GET MARRIED.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.344
- DARLING, HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?

37:25.377 --> 37:26.878
AND SINCE WHEN DID YOU EVER

37:26.912 --> 37:29.348
HAVE THE LEAST INTEREST
IN GETTING MARRIED?

37:29.381 --> 37:32.484
- I DIDN'T. BUT NOT
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO,

37:32.518 --> 37:34.953
BUT BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT
I COULD.

37:34.986 --> 37:38.490
IT WASN'T A STORY I TOLD MYSELF
LIKE STRAIGHT KIDS DID,

37:38.524 --> 37:41.059
YOU KNOW, THAT SOME DAY I'D MEET
THAT SPECIAL PERSON,

37:41.092 --> 37:44.062
AND WE'D FALL IN LOVE
AND HAVE A BIG WEDDING.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.065
IT--IT WAS NEVER REAL FOR ME.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.900
AND THEN ALL THIS STUFF
STARTED HAPPENING,

37:48.934 --> 37:51.036
IN MASSACHUSETTS
AND CALIFORNIA AND HERE.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.372
- ALL OF A SUDDEN,
A WHOLE, WIDE WORLD

37:53.405 --> 37:57.075
OF WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES
OPENED UP.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.512
VOWS AND RICE AND
REGISTERING AT POTTERY BARN.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.914
NOT TO MENTION
AN ACRIMONIOUS DIVORCE,

38:02.948 --> 38:07.052
AN UGLY SETTLEMENT,
AND HAVING YOUR KID HATE YOU.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.087
LOOK, LISTEN TO ME.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.790
ARE YOU LISTENING?
- I'M LISTENING.

38:11.823 --> 38:16.995
- WE'RE QUEER.
WE DON'T NEED MARRIAGE.

38:17.028 --> 38:20.098
WE DON'T NEED THE SANCTION
OF DICKLESS POLITICIANS

38:20.131 --> 38:23.101
AND PEDERAST PRIESTS.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.704
WE FUCK WHO WE WANT TO,
WHEN WE WANT TO.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.439
THAT IS OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.007
- BUT IT'S ALSO
OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT

38:29.040 --> 38:32.578
TO HAVE EVERYTHING
THAT STRAIGHT PEOPLE HAVE.

38:32.611 --> 38:37.583
BECAUSE WE'RE EVERY BIT
AS MUCH HUMAN AS THEY ARE.

38:47.859 --> 38:52.698
- WELL, YOU'RE A WRITER.

38:52.731 --> 38:56.334
REWRITE THE STORY.

39:00.772 --> 39:04.876
[cheering]

39:07.178 --> 39:09.681
- CONGRATULATIONS.

39:14.486 --> 39:18.023
- HMM. THIS IS TOUCHING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

39:19.625 --> 39:21.893
- I DO.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.065
I DO.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.736
BEN, DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I JUST SAID?

39:30.769 --> 39:34.673
- YEAH, I HEARD YOU.
YOU SAID "I... "

39:46.918 --> 39:49.020
- I'M GONNA NEED STAGE SEVEN
FOR RAGE'S LAIR,

39:49.054 --> 39:52.524
AND THE ENTIRE BACK LOT
TO BUILD GAYOPOLIS.

39:52.558 --> 39:55.026
- THERE ARE A FEW OTHER PICTURES
WE'D LIKE TO SHOOT HERE.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.828
- THIS IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT I'M DIRECTING.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.664
[chuckles]
YA PUNK.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.432
YOU SOUND LIKE I'VE ALREADY
GIVEN YOU THE GREEN LIGHT.

40:00.466 --> 40:01.833
- SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

40:01.867 --> 40:03.769
- THE PRICE TAG, FOR STARTERS.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.203
THIS LITTLE EPIC OF YOURS

40:05.236 --> 40:06.905
IS GOING TO COST ME
A FUCKING FORTUNE.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.173
- YOU CAN AFFORD IT.

40:08.206 --> 40:12.043
MY LAST PICTURE
MADE YOU 250 MILLION.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.845
- YEAH. THIS ONE'S DIFFERENT.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.915
A GAY SUPERHERO?
- THE WORLD'S READY FOR IT.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.917
- MAYBE YOUR WORLD,
BUT NOT TOPEKA.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.219
- IF IT'S GOOD,
IF IT'S GOT A BIG ENOUGH STAR,

40:21.252 --> 40:24.222
IF YOU HYPE THE SHIT OUT OF IT,
THEY'LL GO.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.057
RIGHT?

40:26.091 --> 40:27.959
GUYS?

40:27.993 --> 40:30.962
- IT ALL LOOKS PRETTY GRIM
AND DEPRESSING TO ME.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.064
WHO WANTS TO SEE A KID
GET HIS HEAD BASHED IN?

40:33.098 --> 40:34.800
AND WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS SEX?

40:34.833 --> 40:37.603
BLOWJOBS AND BUTT-FUCKING
ON EVERY PAGE.

40:37.636 --> 40:40.539
- IT'S SOMETHING THE AUDIENCE
HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.675
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THEY WANT TO SEE IT NOW?

40:43.709 --> 40:45.611
THE CONCESSION STAND'S
GOING TO HAVE A HELL OF A TIME

40:45.644 --> 40:47.078
SELLING HERSHEY BARS.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.815
[laughter]

40:49.848 --> 40:51.683
LOOK, YOU WANT TO
GO WITH THE GAY THING,

40:51.717 --> 40:54.553
YOU'RE GOING TO CUT BACK
ON THE ASS BUSINESS,

40:54.586 --> 40:56.555
AND IT'S GOT TO BE CHEERIER.

40:56.588 --> 41:00.091
AND WHY DOES YOUR HERO HAVE TO
BE SO FUCKING ARROGANT?

41:00.125 --> 41:03.094
- EXCUSE ME, MR. FENDERMAN,
BUT OUR COMIC BOOK

41:03.128 --> 41:05.030
WAS CONCEIVED THAT WAY
FOR A REASON.

41:05.063 --> 41:09.635
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SHIT THAT
GAY PEOPLE GO THROUGH IS GRIM.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.903
I OUGHT TO KNOW, I'M A KID WHO
GOT HIS HEAD BASHED IN.

41:11.937 --> 41:14.239
AS FAR AS "THE ASS BUSINESS,"

41:14.272 --> 41:17.008
GETTING YOUR BUTT FUCKED
IS ONE OF THE GREAT PLEASURES

41:17.042 --> 41:18.877
AND PRIVILEGES OF BEING GAY.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.847
IF YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED IT
YOURSELF, I RECOMMEND IT.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.583
AS FAR AS RAGE IS CONCERNED,

41:24.616 --> 41:26.718
JUST BECAUSE HE HAS
NO APOLOGIES FOR WHO HE IS

41:26.752 --> 41:29.588
AND NO REGRETS ABOUT HIS LIFE
DOESN'T MAKE HIM ARROGANT.

41:29.621 --> 41:33.525
IT MAKES HIM HONEST AND BRAVE.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.527
SO DESPITE YOUR CONCERNS,

41:35.561 --> 41:38.263
WE PREFER TO BE TRUE TO
OUR ORIGINAL VISION.

41:38.296 --> 41:41.499
RAGE WOULDN'T EXPECT
ANYTHING LESS.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.075
- WE ARE HERE TODAY TO JOIN
IN MATRIMONY

41:50.108 --> 41:51.610
MR. MICHAEL NOVOTNY

41:51.643 --> 41:53.945
AND MR. BENJAMIN BRUCKNER.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.947
- [sniffling]
- CHRIST.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.549
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I'M GOING TO A WEDDING

41:57.583 --> 42:00.786
WITH TWO QUEENS.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.154
- DO YOU, MICHAEL,
PROMISE TO LOVE,

42:03.188 --> 42:05.891
RESPECT, AND CHERISH BEN,

42:05.924 --> 42:08.727
AND BE HIS TRUE
AND FAITHFUL HUSBAND?

42:11.930 --> 42:14.633
- I DO.

42:14.666 --> 42:18.303
- AND DO YOU, BEN,
PROMISE TO LOVE, RESPECT,

42:18.336 --> 42:19.771
AND CHERISH MICHAEL,

42:19.805 --> 42:24.209
AND BE HIS TRUE
AND FAITHFUL HUSBAND?

42:24.242 --> 42:25.777
- SAY "I DO," DUDE.

42:25.811 --> 42:28.313
- [chuckles]

42:28.346 --> 42:32.851
I DO.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.653
- IF ANYONE KNOWS
OF ANY REASON

42:34.686 --> 42:37.255
WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE SHOULD NOT
BE JOINED IN MARRIAGE,

42:37.288 --> 42:40.225
SPEAK NOW
OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.

42:41.693 --> 42:43.194
- YOU SAY ONE WORD,

42:43.228 --> 42:45.230
YOU'RE GONNA BE HOLDING
MORE THAN YOUR PEACE.

42:48.634 --> 42:52.337
- THE RINGS, PLEASE.

42:52.370 --> 42:55.040
- THANK YOU.

43:11.990 --> 43:15.026
- NOW, BY THE AUTHORITY
OF THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO,

43:15.060 --> 43:17.929
I PRONOUNCE YOU
TO BE LEGALLY MARRIED.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.976
- I'M NOT LOSING A SON, HUH.

43:31.009 --> 43:34.713
I'M GAINING A...SON.

43:34.746 --> 43:36.114
- YOU'RE NEXT, MA.

43:36.147 --> 43:39.117
- [sniffling]

43:39.150 --> 43:43.054
- GOD, YOU BARELY SHED A TEAR
AT MEL AND LINZ'S CEREMONY.

43:43.088 --> 43:45.724
- WELL, THEY'RE DYKES,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

43:45.757 --> 43:47.726
THEY SHAKE HANDS
AND GO BOWLING.

43:47.759 --> 43:50.261
HOW MUCH CAN YOU GET CHOKED UP?

43:50.295 --> 43:52.130
- OH, MICHAEL,
WE HAVE TO SIGN THIS.

43:52.163 --> 43:55.133
- THERE WE GO. GLADLY.

43:55.166 --> 43:59.637
- ANYWAY, IT'S NOT
JUST FOR MICHAEL AND BEN.

44:03.041 --> 44:06.878
YOU KNOW, IF THINGS
HAD BEEN DIFFERENT, MAYBE...

44:06.912 --> 44:08.346
- I CANNOT BELIEVE WE
ARE MARRIED.

44:08.379 --> 44:11.282
- NO POINT IN
BEATING YOURSELF UP, TEDDY.

44:11.316 --> 44:14.219
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS,
AREN'T WE?

44:14.252 --> 44:17.756
WHICH MEANS WE'LL BE AROUND A
LOT LONGER THAN MOST MARRIAGES.

44:17.789 --> 44:20.158
[Celebrate the Sun]

44:20.191 --> 44:24.162
- * CELEBRATE THE SUNSHINE

44:24.195 --> 44:26.431
[cheering]

- ALL RIGHT, YOU BOYS
STICK TOGETHER, ALL RIGHT?

44:47.352 --> 44:49.354
AND LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.
- WE WILL, MA.

44:49.387 --> 44:53.058
- SHIT. I JUST
CALLED YOU "BOYS."

44:53.091 --> 44:55.360
YOU'RE MARRIED MEN NOW.

44:55.393 --> 44:57.495
GO ON BEFORE I START BAWLING.

44:57.528 --> 45:00.365
- SOMEONE MENTION BALLING?

45:00.398 --> 45:03.034
- AND YOU, I WANT YOU TO
TAKE IT EASY, YOU HEAR ME?

45:03.068 --> 45:05.336
DON'T ACT LIKE
SOME FUCKING SUPERHERO.

45:05.370 --> 45:07.705
- YES, MOTHER.

45:10.842 --> 45:13.078
- OKAY. I'M GOING TO BE
ON THE FOOD WAGON,

45:13.111 --> 45:17.749
KEEPING AN EYE OUT
FOR ALL OF YOU.

45:17.783 --> 45:19.818
- RIDERS, ARE YOU READY?

45:19.851 --> 45:22.287
[bicycle bells ringing]
OKAY, THEN.
