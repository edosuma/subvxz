WEBVTT

00:10.744 --> 00:12.613
( theme music playing )

00:40.241 --> 00:42.543
- ( phones ringing )
- ( people chatting )

00:45.946 --> 00:49.250
- HI, MURRAY.
- HEY. I'LL SAY HELLO
IN A MINUTE, GUYS.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.352
IT LOOKS BUSY OUT THERE.
IT'S LIKE AN OFFICE.

00:51.452 --> 00:54.155
GUYS, I'LL HAVE
TO BE QUICK TODAY
I'M AFRAID. HERE WE ARE.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.090
BAND MEETING.
BRETT, PRESENT.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.492
- JEMAINE, PRESENT. MURRAY--
- WHY DIDN'T YOU LET US
SAY PRESENT?

00:58.592 --> 01:00.728
I'M TRYING TO SAVE
TIME HERE, JEMAINE.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.230
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE
SAVED MUCH TIME.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.265
I CAN'T HAVE
TIME WASTAGE, ALL RIGHT?
I'M STRESSED OUT.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.434
- DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHY?
- BOTH: NO.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.302
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU.
THE PRIME MINISTER

01:08.402 --> 01:09.770
OF NEW ZEALAND IS
COMING TO NEW YORK...

01:09.870 --> 01:11.105
- REALLY?
- YEAH?

01:11.205 --> 01:12.906
...AND I'VE BEEN
APPOINTED HIS AIDE.

01:13.006 --> 01:15.876
- OH, WOW. CONGRATULATIONS.
- WE MIGHT EVEN GO
TO WASHINGTON

01:15.976 --> 01:17.878
AND MEET
THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICA.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.047
OH, REALLY?
WILL THE QUEEN BE THERE?

01:20.148 --> 01:22.750
NO, IT'S NOT A BIG DO.
IT'S JUST A SMALL PARTY.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.754
ACTUALLY--
GREG, HAS THE PRESIDENT
OF AMERICA RETURNED MY CALL?

01:26.854 --> 01:29.890
- NO, MURRAY.
- OH, YOU'RE THERE,
GREG, LURKING.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.525
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN LURKING THERE?

01:31.625 --> 01:34.795
DOESN'T MATTER. CAN YOU CALL
THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN, PLEASE?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.097
- SURE.
- OKAY. DISMISSED.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.700
LIKES TO LURK THERE,
DOESN'T HE?

01:39.800 --> 01:42.035
OH, I'VE GOT YOU A GIG.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.437
- GREAT.
- OH, YEAH?

01:43.537 --> 01:46.540
HERE WE GO. THERE'S SOME
CLOTHES FOR YOU, JEMAINE.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.877
- OH, THANKS.
- AND HERE'S A NICE COAT
FOR YOU, BRET.

01:49.977 --> 01:53.013
- THANK YOU.
- OH, AND ALSO...

01:53.113 --> 01:55.716
HERE'S A WIG.
YOU COULD WEAR THAT.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.486
- A WIG?
WHAT DOES BRET NEED A--
- YEAH. IT'S FOR THE GIG, OKAY?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.388
- WHAT, A WIG
FOR THE GIG?
- MM-HMM.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.922
- I HAVE TO WEAR THIS?
- YEAH, THAT'S YOUR ONE.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.492
THE ONLY THING
YOU'LL NEED IS--

02:04.592 --> 02:07.528
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE SONGS OF
SIMON & GARFUNKEL?

02:07.628 --> 02:11.332
YOU'VE BOOKED US A GIG
AS A SIMON & GARFUNKEL
TRIBUTE ACT?

02:11.432 --> 02:13.267
- AH.
- HAVEN'T YOU?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.569
- YOU'RE ONTO IT.
- YOU'RE TRYING TO
DISGUISE IT.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.738
I TRIED TO DISGUISE IT
AS A GIFT, OKAY?

02:17.838 --> 02:20.208
- I'LL ADMIT IT.
- MURRAY, WE DON'T SING
OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.210
OH, I KNOW, BRET,
BUT HERE'S THE THING:

02:22.310 --> 02:23.611
I LISTENED
TO SOME OF THEIR SONGS,

02:23.711 --> 02:25.246
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY BETTER
THAN YOUR SONGS.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.215
AND THIS IS A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THEM.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.217
YOU DO THEIR SONGS,
YOU CAN LOOK LIKE THEM.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.451
BUT THEY'VE ALREADY
DONE THEIR SONGS.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.052
WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN YOUR LAST GIG.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.721
IT WAS BARELY
A GIG, WASN'T IT?

02:33.821 --> 02:36.123
WE WENT INTO
A KARAOKE BAR AND YOU PUT
OUR NAMES ON THE LIST.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.591
- EXACTLY.
- THAT'S NOT A GIG.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.060
- YEAH, IT WAS.
IT WAS A BAD GIG.
- IT'S NOT A GIG.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.963
- IT WASN'T EVEN A GIG.
- IT'S NOT A BAD GIG.
THAT'S JUST A KARAOKE NIGHT.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.032
YOU DON'T NEED A MANAGER,
'CAUSE YOU DON'T GET PAID.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.468
- YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT
YOUR NAME ON THE LIST.
- WELL, WE KNOW THAT NOW.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.737
WE'RE STILL IN
A LEARNING PHASE,
AREN'T WE?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.672
YOU'VE BEEN MANAGING US
FOR TWO YEARS.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.875
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THAT'S
THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN
TO THAT KARAOKE BAR.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.479
MY POINT IS, GUYS,
THIS GIG I'M GIVING YOU NOW
IS A LEGITIMATE GIG.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.249
IT'S FROM AN AGENCY
THAT BOOKS LOOKALIKES.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.183
WELL, WE DON'T LOOK
LIKE SIMON & GARFUNKEL.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.820
WELL, HERE'S THE THING--
THE ACTUAL LOOKALIKES DON'T
LOOK ANYTHING ALIKE,

03:06.920 --> 03:09.423
AND THEY DON'T LOOK
LIKE THE GUYS THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE,

03:09.523 --> 03:12.192
AND THEY'RE BUSY.
SO I WENT IN THERE

03:12.293 --> 03:13.827
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU LOOK JUST
LIKE THEY DO.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.430
SO WE LOOK
LIKE SOME SIMON &
GARFUNKEL LOOKALIKES

03:16.530 --> 03:18.832
WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE
SIMON & GARFUNKEL?

03:18.932 --> 03:21.235
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT A BLESSING.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.304
- SO, YOU HAPPY TO DO IT?
- NO, CLEARLY NOT.

03:23.404 --> 03:27.007
- NO, WE'RE NOT DOING IT.
- OKAY. WELL, I'LL HAVE TO
PUT THAT $50 BACK THEN.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.109
- $50?
- $50 EACH.

03:29.209 --> 03:33.881
* HAVE HER MAKE ME
A CAMBRIC SHIRT *

03:33.981 --> 03:36.317
* I NEED A SHIRT

03:36.417 --> 03:40.888
* PARSLEY, SAGE,
ROSEMARY AND THYME *

03:40.988 --> 03:42.990
* AND THYME

03:43.090 --> 03:48.862
* WITHOUT A SEAM
NOR FINE NEEDLE... *
( both mumble )

03:51.299 --> 03:52.833
LOOK AT THAT, MAN.
THEY'VE GOT APPLES.

03:52.933 --> 03:57.538
- OH, REALLY?
- GUYS. BLOODY BRILLIANT,
ALL RIGHT?

03:57.638 --> 04:00.574
- THANKS, ELTON.
- IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE
SOMEONE ELSE UP THERE

04:00.674 --> 04:03.411
JUST-- LIKE ME,
JUST KIND OF DOING
MY THING, YOU KNOW?

04:03.511 --> 04:04.912
YOU'RE DOING ELTON JOHN'S
THING REALLY, THOUGH.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.981
I'M DOING MY THING WHICH IS
DOING ELTON JOHN'S THING.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.551
- OH YEAH?
WHAT'S HE DOING THEN?
- HE'S DOING HIS THING.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.320
- HIS THING,
WHICH IS THE SAME THING.
- I'M DOING-- I--

04:12.420 --> 04:14.422
MY THING, THOUGH,
IS TO DO ELTON JOHN'S THING

04:14.522 --> 04:16.324
WHICH IS WHY I SAID
I'M DOING MY THING--

04:16.424 --> 04:18.359
- DOESN'T HE GO INTO THE THI--
- MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR
THE FIRST THING I SAID.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.061
WHATEVER, BUT--
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.730
POINT: RIGHT THERE.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.333
THEY BOOKED
ANOTHER ELTON JOHN ACT
SAME NIGHT AS ME,

04:25.433 --> 04:28.602
DRESSED EXACTLY LIKE ME--
1973 "HONKY CHATEAU" OUTFIT.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.004
THERE IS A GUY
WHO IS NOT DOING
HIS OWN THING.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.641
THERE'S A GUY WHO DOESN'T
HAVE A SINGLE ORIGINAL
IDEA IN HIS HEAD.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.843
- HE'S DRESSED-- HE'S DOING
ELTON JOHN'S THING.
- HE LOOKS LIKE YOU.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.612
- YEAH. NO, HE'S DOING
MY THING WHEN I'M DOING--
- WOMAN: HEY, JOHN.

04:38.712 --> 04:42.316
OH, HOLD ME CLOSER,
TINY DANCER.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.017
- HELLO.
- DID YOU SEE ELTON Â£2?

04:44.117 --> 04:47.087
OH, EH, YES.
WELL, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU

04:47.187 --> 04:48.956
TO TWO VERY TALENTED
YOUNG MEN.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.859
THIS IS PARSLEY
AND THIS IS SAGE.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.527
- HELLO, SAGE.
- HI.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.096
THEY FILLED IN
FOR THE GUYS FROM
TROUBLED WATERS.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.098
ONE OF THEM HAD
A BLADDER INFECTION.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.434
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.903
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.304
I FEEL HONORED
TO MEET YOU.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.140
- OH.
- OOH.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.809
CAN YOU FEEL
SOME LOVE TONIGHT?

05:08.909 --> 05:11.479
HEY, WANT TO SEE
A GUY WHO LOOKS JUST
LIKE BONO FROM U2?

05:11.579 --> 05:13.647
- OH YEAH YEAH?
- YEAH, BUT REAL MUSCULAR.
COME HERE.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.549
COOL.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.185
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- OH.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.920
I USUALLY LOOK
BETTER THAN THIS.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.357
- I LIKE YOUR HEIGHT.
- I'M USUALLY THIS HEIGHT.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.793
DO YOU LIKE
BUBBLE BATHS?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.729
SORRY, I'M GETTING
AHEAD OF MYSELF.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.664
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO DINNER
WITH ME TOMORROW NIGHT?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.233
UH, I'LL JUST SEE
IF I'M AVAILABLE. YES.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.537
BRET, THIS GIRL
ASKED ME OUT.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.642
- ( camera clicks )
- ( snoring )

05:41.742 --> 05:43.744
- OH, THE PRIME MINIS--
- ( whispering ) SHH SHH.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.247
- THE PRIME MINISTER.
- YES, HE'S TERRIBLY JET-LAGGED.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.850
HE THINKS IT'S TOMORROW.
DON'T WAKE HIM.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.652
HEY, CAN YOU TAKE
A PHOTO OF ME WITH HIM?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.887
- YEAH, OKAY.
GET IN, BRET.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.390
- CAN YOU MOVE JUST--
- HE'S WAKING UP.
GET OUT. GO ON, GO.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.626
- AH.
- HE'S SEEN YOU.
COME BACK, HE'S SEEN YOU.

05:58.726 --> 06:02.362
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MURRAY.
DROPPED OFF THERE.
BLOODY JET LAG.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.866
- WHAT DAY IS IT, YESTERDAY?
- NO, IT'S TODAY, SIR.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.435
OH, YES.
OF COURSE IT IS.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.203
OH, WELL,
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU,
PRIME MINISTER.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.539
THESE ARE TWO
OF THE LEADING LIGHTS

06:11.639 --> 06:13.974
OF THE NEW ZEALAND/NEW YORK
ARTISTIC COMMUNITY.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.544
OH, YEAH?
ARTISTS, ARE YOU?

06:16.644 --> 06:19.480
GOOD ON YOU.
WHAT SORT OF THING
DO YOU PAINT?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.782
- NUDES?
- NO, WE'RE A BAND,
YOUR HONOR.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.117
WELL, I'M BRIAN, THE PRIME
MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.454
- YES, WE KNOW THAT.
- IT'S VERY NICE TO
MEET YOU, MY LORD.

06:26.554 --> 06:29.657
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.
I'M JUST A BIT JETLAGGED.
CHRIST, WHAT A FLIGHT.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.925
I WATCHED A COUPLE OF FILMS
ON THE WAY OVER THOUGH,

06:32.025 --> 06:34.161
BUT MY SCREEN BROKE
HALFWAY THROUGH "CARS."

06:34.261 --> 06:37.330
HAVE YOU SEEN THE FILM
"CARS," MURRAY? DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.733
LET ME JUST--
GREG, THE PRIME MINISTER

06:39.833 --> 06:42.402
WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END
OF THE MOVIE "CARS."

06:42.503 --> 06:45.606
- GREG: Okay.
- SPECIFICALLY,
I'D LIKE TO KNOW

06:45.706 --> 06:48.341
WHAT HAPPENS
BETWEEN THE MAIN CAR
AND THE GIRL CAR.

06:48.442 --> 06:52.045
GREG, JUST AN UPDATE HERE:
THE PRIME MINISTER
WANTS TO KNOW

06:52.145 --> 06:54.648
SPECIFICALLY
BETWEEN THE MAIN CAR
AND THE GIRL CAR--

06:54.748 --> 06:57.885
- DO THEY GET
TOGETHER AT THE END?
- Yes, I believe they do.

06:57.985 --> 07:02.255
- OH. THEY DO GET TOGETHER.
- GOOD. IT WAS TOUCH AND GO
THERE FOR A WHILE.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.925
- THANK YOU FOR THAT, MURRAY.
THAT WAS WELL DONE.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.327
THAT'S THE SORT
OF THING WE SHOULD
BE DOING IN NEW ZEALAND.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.262
- I'LL MAKE A NOTE
OF IT, PRIME MINISTER.
- YEAH, DO MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.

07:09.362 --> 07:12.466
"TALKING CARS."
I'LL PUT YOU DOWN AS ONE
OF THE CREATORS, THOUGH,

07:12.566 --> 07:14.935
- 'CAUSE YOU CAME UP
WITH THIS CONCEPT HERE.
- I THINK SO. YEAH.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.237
- PUT ME DOWN AS A CREATOR.
- OKAY. DO YOU MIND

07:17.337 --> 07:19.272
IF I PUT MY NAME
ON THERE AS WELL,
PRIME MINISTER? JUST AS--

07:19.372 --> 07:23.343
- PUT IT DOWN
"MURRAY, CO-CREATOR."
- OH, THANKS VERY MUCH.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.345
OKAY, WELL, WE'LL BE
SEEING YOU AROUND, GUYS.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.716
OH, DID MURRAY TELL YOU
I'M MEETING THE PRESIDENT?
WHEN IS THAT, MURRAY?

07:28.816 --> 07:31.585
UH, WELL, I'M STILL
SORT OF IRONING OUT
THE FINER DETAILS,

07:31.685 --> 07:35.388
BUT AT THE MOMENT
IT'S SCHEDULED IN
FOR THIS FRIDAY.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.957
WHAT HAVE I GOT BOOKED
UNTIL THEN, MURRAY?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.593
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU COULD
GO ON A GUIDED TOUR

07:39.693 --> 07:41.795
OF THE CULTURAL SIGHTS
OF NEW YORK CITY.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.997
PERHAPS THESE TWO GUYS
COULD GUIDE YOU.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.199
OH, GREAT.
GOOD ON YOU.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.869
I'LL LOOK FORWARD
TO IT. OH, WELL.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.542
- WHAT A GREAT MAN.
- MURRAY, YOU SHOULD BE TAKING
HIM ON THE TOUR OF NEW YORK.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.710
I'M SORRY, GUYS, OKAY?
I'M IN REAL TROUBLE HERE,

07:56.810 --> 07:58.946
ALL RIGHT? I HAVEN'T
ORGANIZED THE MEETING
WITH THE PRESIDENT

07:59.046 --> 08:00.581
AND THE PRIME MINISTER
DOESN'T KNOW.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.716
BUT, MURRAY, WE CAN'T TAKE
THE PRIME MINISTER AROUND.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.586
- WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
- YES, YOU CAN. IT'S EASY.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.720
- DOESN'T HE NEED A BODYGUARD?
- HE'S THE PRIME MINISTER.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.656
- A BODYGUARD?
- YEAH.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.924
- WELL, THERE YOU GO-- BRET.
- BRET: WHAT, ME?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.392
YEAH, YOU CAN
OFFER PROTECTION.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.727
WELL, IS THERE
A NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT GUN?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.929
YEAH, BUT THE ARMY'S
GOT THAT.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.566
YOU COULD JUST PRETEND
YOU'VE GOT A GUN,

08:18.666 --> 08:21.068
SO JUST PUT YOUR HAND
IN YOUR JACKET LIKE THAT.

08:21.168 --> 08:25.005
- DON'T MOVE.
- DON'T PULL THAT OUT, 'CAUSE
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A GUN.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.576
- OH, YEAH YEAH.
- WHEN YOU PULL IT OUT,
JUST GO "IT'S STILL IN THERE."

08:28.676 --> 08:30.611
- OKAY?
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.581
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.251
HELLO, IS THAT WARRICK?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.287
IS THAT WARRICK?
YEAH, HI, IT'S BRIAN.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.222
THESE ARE--
THESE ARE FBI STYLE.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.125
THESE HAVE ACTUALLY
BEEN WORN BY THE FBI
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.828
HOW'S THE COUNTRY GOING?
NO, SERIOUSLY, HOW'S IT GOING?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.864
- WHO IS THAT GUY?
- HE'S THE PRIME MINISTER
OF NEW ZEALAND.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.801
- WHAT LANGUAGE
IS HE TALKING?
- BOTH: ENGLISH.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.536
YEAH, NOW LOOK,
HOW'S THE ENVIRONMENT GOING?

08:56.637 --> 08:59.372
- WELL, CAN WE
CLEAN IT UP A BIT?
- YEAH, MAYBE.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.242
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
JUST GET SOME OF YOUR
COUSINS TOGETHER

09:02.342 --> 09:03.577
AND JUST CLEAN
IT UP A BIT.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.013
DAVE, I'M GOING ON A DATE
WITH A WOMAN TONIGHT.

09:06.113 --> 09:09.549
- GONNA BANG HER?
- SHE DIDN'T MENTION THAT.
SHE MENTIONED DINNER.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.720
OH. WELL, LET ME KNOW
HOW IT GOES.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.988
- OKAY.
- I THOUGHT SO.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.457
HEY, WHERE'D YOU GET
"THE MATRIX"?

09:17.557 --> 09:19.627
THIS HAS JUST COME OUT
IN NEW ZEALAND.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.196
HELLO. YES.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.766
COULD I PLEASE SPEAK
TO THE PRESIDENT, PLEASE?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.701
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I CALLED BEFORE?

09:27.801 --> 09:30.337
OH, RIGHT,
THE NUMBER CAME UP.
WELL, YES. YES, IT IS ME,

09:30.437 --> 09:33.607
UM, BUT THIS TIME I'VE GOT
MY PRIME MINISTER HERE.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.442
HE WASN'T HERE BEFORE,
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY HERE NOW

09:35.542 --> 09:37.577
AND IT'S REALLY BECOME
AN URGENT MATTER

09:37.678 --> 09:39.880
THAT I ORGANIZE
THE TWO GREAT MEN TO MEET.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.915
HE'S COME ALL THE WAY
FROM NEW ZEALAND.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.651
NEW ZEALAND.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.620
IT IS A COUNTRY!
YES, IT IS!

09:46.720 --> 09:48.555
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.223
I'M BUSY AS WELL.
I'M GONNA GO.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.125
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
CALL YOU BACK, ACTUALLY.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.628
THANK YOU.
( sighs )

09:57.965 --> 10:00.968
I MEAN, HOW DO WE KNOW
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE

10:01.068 --> 10:02.970
IN AMERICA
AND NOT PART
OF THE MATRIX?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.372
I MEAN, EVERYTHING
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE--

10:05.472 --> 10:09.643
ARE WE REALLY HERE
OR ARE WE JUST PART
OF A GIANT BATTERY?

10:09.743 --> 10:12.245
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
IN THE MATRIX,
YOUR HONOR.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.815
- NO, NEITHER DO I.
- NO, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN IT EITHER.

10:14.915 --> 10:18.051
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.
- IT'S JUST AN INTERESTING IDEA
THAT IS OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.221
- I BELIEVE
IN THE MATRIX, YOUR MAJESTY.
- I KNEW IT. SO DO I.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.091
YOU KNOW WHY, DAVE?
HAVE YOU EVER HAD DEJA VU?

10:24.191 --> 10:27.360
ALL THE TIME.
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT IS, DON'T YOU?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.529
( whispers )
GLITCH IN THE MATRIX.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.631
FUCKIN' A.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.504
SO, SAGE, ARE YOU
THE HUGEST SIMON &
GARFUNKEL FAN OR WHAT?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.840
UH, YEAH, I LIKE
SOME OF THEIR SONGS,

10:39.940 --> 10:43.043
LIKE THE ONE
ABOUT THE FAIR, AND--

10:43.143 --> 10:44.778
"SCARBOROUGH FAIR"-
PARENTHESIS-"CANTICLE."

10:44.878 --> 10:46.079
YEAH, IS THAT THE ONE
WITH THE SHOPPING LIST--

10:46.179 --> 10:48.749
ONE GUY HAS A SHOPPING LIST
FOR ANOTHER GUY

10:48.849 --> 10:50.818
WITH SOME HERBS
AND SPICES--

10:50.918 --> 10:52.753
PARSLEY, SAGE,
ROSEMARY AND THYME?

10:52.853 --> 10:55.856
- YES. ACTUALLY--
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
THERE'S A PHONECALL FOR YOU.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.125
REALLY?
BE RIGHT BACK.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.831
( whispering )
JEMAINE. JEMAINE.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.632
( whispering )
MEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HOW DID YOU GET THERE?

11:05.733 --> 11:08.936
JEMAINE, SHE IS CRAZY,
DANGEROUS.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.437
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD FRIEND.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.272
WOULD YOU PLEASE LEAVE?
I'M TRYING TO HAVE A DATE.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.608
I AM WARNING YOU, JEMAINE,
SHE IS PSYCHO.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.410
I HAVE BEEN
WATCHING YOU GUYS

11:17.510 --> 11:20.513
AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN
THAT KIND OF PSYCHOSIS
IN MY LIFE.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.682
GET OUT.
GET OUT OF HERE, PLEASE.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.418
( sniffles )

11:25.518 --> 11:27.120
( footsteps approaching )

11:27.220 --> 11:29.723
( sighs )
THERE WAS NO ONE THERE.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.992
- THAT'S WEIRD.
- MMM. THAT'S--
THAT'S STRANGE.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.927
SO CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.263
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR HAIR?

11:36.363 --> 11:40.567
NOTHING. I-- I PUT
A LITTLE BIT MORE WATER
IN IT THAN I USUALLY DO.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.871
- IT WAS REALLY DIFFERENT
THE OTHER NIGHT.
- THAT WAS A WIG.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.572
IT WAS A BIG,
ORANGE AFRO WIG.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.407
YOU WOULDN'T MIND
GOING HOME AND CHANGING

11:47.507 --> 11:49.476
INTO WHAT YOU WERE WEARING
THE OTHER NIGHT, WOULD YOU?

11:50.978 --> 11:54.181
I WAS REALLY ATTRACTED
TO THAT, AND NOW THIS.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.751
UH, YEAH, I SUPP--
I SUPPOSE I COULD CHANGE.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.220
PLEASE. NOW.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.092
- OKAY.
- GREAT. THANKS.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.330
I'M JUST GONNA MAKE IT
A LITTLE DARKER IN HERE.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.166
UM, ARE YOU SURE THAT
I REALLY NEED TO WEAR...

12:13.266 --> 12:15.936
- JUST A LITTLE BIT DARKER.
- ...THE WIG?

12:16.036 --> 12:18.671
- A LITTLE BIT DARKER.
- IT'S REALLY DARK IN HERE.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.474
JUST A LITTLE BIT--
AND CLIMB UP HERE.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.077
- UMM...
- I JUST NEED YOU
TO PUT YOUR LEGS OVER

12:24.177 --> 12:27.014
AND BLOCK THAT LIGHT
WITH YOUR HEAD.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.249
- I USUALLY--
- IT'S KIND OF
THE RIGHT HEIGHT

12:29.349 --> 12:31.118
IF YOU JUST--
COULD YOU JUST-- YEAH--

12:31.218 --> 12:33.787
- TAKE OFF YOUR GLASSES?
- OH, I LIKE TO KEEP
MY GLASSES ON

12:33.887 --> 12:36.023
- BECAUSE I LIKE TO SEE IF--
- TAKE THEM OFF.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.125
I USUALLY LIKE
TO SEE THE DETAILS.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.027
DO YOU ALWAYS TALK
WITH THE ACCENT?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.495
- YEAH.
- DON'T TALK.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.598
- SING.
- PARDON?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.134
SING "BRIGHT EYES."

12:47.234 --> 12:49.369
- I DON'T THINK THAT--
- SING IT.

12:49.469 --> 12:53.540
- * SOMEWHERE THERE ARE--
- DON'T SING.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.242
DON'T TALK.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.138
TAKE A SPOONFUL OF CEREAL
SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
HAVING BREAKFAST.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.375
- HI, JEMAINE.
- HEY, MAN.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.878
- HEY.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.481
I WAS ON THAT DATE

15:16.049 --> 15:18.651
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
YOUR ART GARFUNKEL COSTUME?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.689
I DON'T KNOW. SHE JUST
PREFERS ME TO WEAR IT.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.993
- DAVE: HMM.
- JUST ONE MORE PHOTO, OKAY?
JUST ONE MORE.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.428
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.934
- YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.
- I DIDN'T SAY
IT WAS WEIRD.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.537
- BUT IT IS, THOUGH.
IT IS-- IT'S WEIRD.
- NO NO, IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.973
- DAVE'S RIGHT.
- BUT IT'S ALSO
THE COOLEST FUCKING THING

15:40.073 --> 15:41.975
- I'VE EVER HEARD
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
- THANK YOU.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.545
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:45.645 --> 15:48.481
REAP THE BENEFITS THAT BEING

15:48.581 --> 15:51.018
I MEAN I'VE--
I'VE HAD WOMEN
COME UP TO ME

15:51.118 --> 15:53.920
AND THEY SAY,
"OH, ELTON, I LOVE YOU.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.655
PLEASE HAVE MY BABY."

15:55.755 --> 15:58.925
AND I'VE HAD
11 CHILDREN, YOU KNOW,
ALL ELTON BABIES.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.928
- ELTON JOHN'S GAY THOUGH.
- YEAH, AND SO AM I WHEN
I'M IN CHARACTER.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.765
- JEMAINE, HOW LONG
CAN YOU KEEP THIS UP?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.601
A COUPLE OF YEARS.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.008
YEAH. NO, THE TAXI FARE
WAS OUTRAGEOUS.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.909
IT WAS 1,000
NEW ZEALAND DOLLARS.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.479
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE RUNNING
THE COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT.
TRY TO GET IT UP.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.581
SIR, THERE ARE
NO CELL PHONES
ALLOWED ON THIS TOUR.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.183

16:23.283 --> 16:25.218

16:34.027 --> 16:37.030

16:51.144 --> 16:53.180
YEAH. HI, I'M BRIAN,
THE PRIME MINISTER
OF NEW ZEALAND.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.847
JUST A SEC.
I'VE GOT A CARD SOMEWHERE.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.483
THIS IS GREG.
HE'S ON PHOTOGRAPHS.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.386
AND BRET HERE,
HE'S A BODYGUARD.
AREN'T YOU, BRET?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.020
HERE YOU GO.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.724
- THIS SAYS "JOHN."
- YES, I KNOW IT SAYS "JOHN."

17:04.824 --> 17:06.593
THAT WAS
THE LAST PRIME MINISTER.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.428
WE HAD 3,000 OF THOSE
PRINTED. WE COULDN'T
JUST THROW THEM AWAY.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.497
STILL THE SAME PHONE NUMBER,
ISN'T IT, MURRAY?

17:10.597 --> 17:13.500
SAME PHONE NUMBER.
BASICALLY, WHEN YOU CALL UP,
JUST ASK FOR BRIAN, NOT JOHN.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.336
- IT CHANGES EVERY THREE YEARS.
- THE THING IS, WE'VE GOT
A MEETING

17:16.436 --> 17:18.938
WITH THE BIG GUY,
THE CHIEF. CHIEF TO CHIEF.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.708
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU
INTO THE OVAL OFFICE.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.743
BUT WE HAVE
A MEETING SCHEDULED.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.379
- YOU HAVE A SCHEDULED MEETING?
- YEAH, THAT'S BASICALLY
WHAT I JUST SAID.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.281

LOOK, I'VE GOT A 20 HERE,

17:39.559 --> 17:42.729
WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE
IN THE PRESIDENT'S HALLWAY.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.468
- JEMAINE, WHAT'S WRONG?
ARE YOU OKAY?
- HI, MEL.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.803
ARE YOU UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING?
IS IT THAT CRAZY BITCH?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.206
- MY GIRLFRIEND, YES.
- DID SHE SLAP YOU AROUND?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.308
- NO.

AROUND ON YOU?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.943
- NO.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.112

17:59.212 --> 18:01.248
MEL, CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING QUITE PERSONAL?

18:01.348 --> 18:03.516
YES. OH, YOU CAN
TELL ME ANYTHING.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.686
PLEASE. YOU CAN TRUST ME.
I AM HERE FOR YOU.

18:06.786 --> 18:11.524
SHE MAKES ME
DRESS UP AS ART GARFUNKEL
AND HAVE SEX WITH HER.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.062
WHAT? THAT IS SICK.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.598
THAT IS SICKENING.
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

18:18.698 --> 18:22.169
WHAT KIND OF
DESPERATE FREAK GOES ALONG
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

18:22.269 --> 18:24.070
WELL, I GO ALONG WITH IT.

18:24.171 --> 18:27.240
SHE CALLS IT
GARFUNKELING.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.776
- OH.
- I THINK I'VE GOT
LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.612
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST--
I WAS JUST SO DISGUSTED

18:32.712 --> 18:36.316
BY WHAT YOU DID,
I CAN'T EVEN FOCUS ON
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ANYMORE.

18:36.416 --> 18:40.187
I WAS JUST SAYING I HAVE
QUITE LOW SELF-ESTEEM NOW.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.658
DO YOU WANNA...

18:46.893 --> 18:49.028
REST YOUR HEAD
ON MY BOSOMS?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.464
THAT'S FINE, MEL.
THANK YOU.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.203

20:45.945 --> 20:47.480
( growls )

20:47.580 --> 20:49.882
- ANGRY?
- NO, MORE THAN THAT.
ONE UP FROM THAT.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.685
- OH, LIVID.
- I'M JUST SO LIVID
WITH YOU, HEWITT.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.355
I REALLY WANTED
TO MEET THE PRESIDENT.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.357
I'M JUST SO DISAPPOINTED.

20:57.457 --> 21:00.393
I TOLD EVERYONE BACK
IN NEW ZEALAND THAT I WAS
GONNA MEET THE PRESIDENT.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.329
I TOLD MY MOM I WAS
GONNA MEET THE PRESIDENT.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.196
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL HER
WHEN I GET BACK THERE

21:04.297 --> 21:05.632
AND SAY THAT I COULDN'T
MEET THE PRESIDENT?

21:05.732 --> 21:08.100
I'M GOING TO
LOOK LIKE A COMPLETE
AND UTTER TURKEY.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.069
YOU'RE NOT
THE TURKEY, SIR.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.539
GREG AND I ARE
THE TURKEYS.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.309
I'M SORRY.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.045
WAS THAT
AN OFFICIAL APOLOGY?

21:19.145 --> 21:20.580
YES, SIR.

21:20.680 --> 21:25.752
"OFFICIAL APOLOGY MADE
BY MURRAY HEWITT.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.088
APOLOGY ACCEPTED."

21:29.188 --> 21:31.724
- THANK YOU, SIR.
- GOOD.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.627
WELL, WE'VE STILL
GOT THE BARBEQUE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.563
YOU KNOW, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT THAT, MURRAY.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.431
A BARBEQUE IS
A BIT OLD-FASHIONED,
DON'T YOU THINK?

21:38.531 --> 21:40.433
WHAT ABOUT
A FONDUE PARTY INSTEAD?

21:40.533 --> 21:42.168
- YES.
- YES.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.671
I MEAN, I'VE GOT
THE CHEESE COVERED.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.674
- MURRAY: ALL RIGHT.
- AND WHAT COULD YOU
BRING, MURRAY?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.842
- THE SALADS, PERHAPS?
- DEFINITELY.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.812
- BRET, WHAT CAN YOU BRING?
- I CAN MAKE HALF
A DOZEN CROUTONS.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.047
HALF A DOZEN.
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GO
HIGHER THAN HALF A DOZEN?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.450
- 900?
- THEY'D BE VERY SMALL,

21:57.550 --> 21:59.486
- ALMOST LIKE CRUMBS.
- 900-- I THINK THAT'S
TOO MANY.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.421
TRY AND SPLIT
THE DIFFERENCE.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.356
TRY AND COME DOWN FROM 900
BUT UP FROM SIX OR SEVEN.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.025
I COULD PROBABLY MAKE
15 CROUTONS IF YOU LIKE.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.494
EXCELLENT.
EXCELLENT IDEA.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.662
YOU'RE SHOWING PROMISE,
YOUNG MAN.

22:09.762 --> 22:13.065
- ALL RIGHT.
- "BRETT'S SHOWN PROMISE.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.934
P.M."

22:15.034 --> 22:16.903
WELL.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.207
- ( kissing )
- ( knocks on door )

22:21.307 --> 22:23.510
WHO COULD THAT BE?
WOULD YOU GET THAT?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.480
MEL?

22:30.950 --> 22:35.187
- HELLO.
- OH. HELLO,
ART GARFUNKEL.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.989
SORRY, IS-- IS KAREN IN?

22:37.089 --> 22:39.125
( door closes )

22:39.225 --> 22:42.028
( stammers )
KAREN, UH...

22:43.195 --> 22:45.498
ART GARFUNKEL IS
AT THE DOOR.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.501
KAREN: OH, GOD!
I'LL BE THERE
IN A MINUTE.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.144
- HI, KAREN.
- ART, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

22:58.244 --> 23:00.747
KAREN, HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO KEEP DOING THIS?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.649
DOING WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.384
COME ON,
I KNOW YOU STILL
HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.

23:05.485 --> 23:09.055
WOW. YOU ARE
REALLY SELF-OBSESSED.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.990
IT'S ALL "ME ME ME,"
ISN'T IT?

23:11.090 --> 23:14.527
WELL, THIS IS
MY BOYFRIEND SAGE. WE HAVE
A VERY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.328
- YOU CAN'T STAND THAT,
CAN YOU?
- COME ON.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.531
ANOTHER ART GARFUNKEL
IMPERSONATOR?

23:18.631 --> 23:20.867
- UM, I SHOULD GO.
- NO NO NO.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.035
YOU KNOW, IF YOU THOUGHT
A LITTLE BIT LESS
ABOUT YOURSELF

23:23.135 --> 23:25.237
AND A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT ME, THEN I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.607
I THINK OF NOTHING
OTHER THAN YOU

23:27.707 --> 23:30.076
AND I KNOW
YOU STILL THINK ABOUT ME.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.278
- IS THAT TRUE?
- YEAH.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.747
- OH.
- SO...

23:34.847 --> 23:38.150
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- DON'T DO THAT
TO ME ANYMORE.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.387
- I-- I WILL GO.
- I MISSED YOU.

23:41.488 --> 23:45.992
- THIS IS LIKE
THE 12th ONE?
- I JUST...

23:47.594 --> 23:50.096
( chatting )

23:50.196 --> 23:52.231
- HELLO? DON'T--
- ( feedback )

23:52.331 --> 23:54.033
GREG, JUST TURN DOWN--
DOWN THE GAIN.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.635
SORRY.
HELLO, EVERYONE.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.970
WELCOME TO
THE PRIME MINISTER'S
FONDUE PARTY.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.672
NOW JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,

23:59.772 --> 24:01.741
THERE'S OVER
FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS
OF CHEESES TO TRY TONIGHT

24:01.841 --> 24:04.343
AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN
BROUGHT ALL THE WAY
FROM NEW ZEALAND

24:04.443 --> 24:06.779
BY OUR VERY OWN
PRIME MINISTER.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.815
( applause )

24:10.983 --> 24:14.987
NOW THE PRIME MINISTER,
HE CAME TO THE U.S. TO
MEET THE PRESIDENT.

24:15.087 --> 24:19.458
UNFORTUNATELY,
EVENTS TRANSPIRED
OR DIDN'T TRANSPIRE.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.628
THE WHITE HOUSE--
VERY HARD TO GET AHOLD OF

24:21.728 --> 24:23.429
AND ANYWAY,
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.766
SO WHAT I'VE DONE
IS I'VE MANAGED TO PULL
SOME STRINGS MYSELF

24:26.866 --> 24:29.368
- AND I'VE GOT HIM
HERE TONIGHT.
- WHAT?

24:29.468 --> 24:30.903
PLEASE PUT
YOUR HANDS TOGETHER--

24:31.003 --> 24:33.439
THE 44TH PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES!

24:33.540 --> 24:36.576
( "Hail to the Chief"
playing over stereo )

24:47.219 --> 24:49.522
( chatting )

24:51.257 --> 24:54.260
( Mel moaning )
KISS ME. KISS ME.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.263
- ( giggles )
- BRET?

24:57.363 --> 24:59.065
- OH, HEY, JEMAINE.
- OH.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.401
- HELLO.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.170

- HI-- HI, JEMAINE.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.775
- GOOD NIGHT.
- OKAY, JUST DRIVE.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.578
JUST DRIVE, DOUG.
JUST DRIVE.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.446
MR. PRESIDENT,

THE MAN RESPONSIBLE

25:14.547 --> 25:16.849
FOR THIS
HISTORIC OCCASION--

25:16.949 --> 25:19.719
WHO'S THE DEPUTY CULTURAL
ATTACHE FOR NEW ZEALAND

25:19.819 --> 25:21.621
OH, YEAH, I MET HIM BACK
AT THE AGENCY.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.390
I ALSO DO USHER
AND SOMETIMES WILL SMITH.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.492
THE AGENCY?
WHAT'S HE TALKING
ABOUT, MURRAY?

25:26.593 --> 25:30.396
THE C.I.A. WOULD
BE THE AGENCY.

25:30.496 --> 25:33.666
ACTUALLY, HE'S PROBABLY
TALKING ABOUT CODEWORDS--
OPERATION WILL SMITH.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.434
- WELL.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.437
ABSOLUTELY. SOMEONE GET

25:38.537 --> 25:40.139
LET'S GET HIM
NEW ZEALAND BEER, GREG.

25:40.239 --> 25:43.109
- WE SHOULD GET A PHOTO.
- YEAH, A PHOTO WOULD
BE GREAT, ACTUALLY.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.811
GREG,
PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.846
FORGET THE BEER.
LET'S DO SOME PHOTOS.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.582
( whispers ) ACTUALLY,
TAKE AUTOFOCUS OFF AND
STAND BACK A BIT.

25:49.682 --> 25:52.619
- ALL RIGHT.
- NOW COULD WE GET ONE

25:52.719 --> 25:54.821
WHERE IT MAKES
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
TAKING MY ADVICE?

25:54.921 --> 25:58.390
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE ONE WE'RE GONNA RUN

25:58.490 --> 26:02.061
OKAY, NOW ONE WHERE
WE'RE JUST EYE TO EYE,

26:02.161 --> 26:03.963
ACTUALLY, IF YOU COULD
JUST POP DOWN A BIT--

26:04.063 --> 26:06.899
- JUST A LITTLE BIT, YEAH?
- MURRAY: GO ON TIPTOES, BRIAN.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.201
THAT'S GREAT.
NOW ONE WHERE
WE'RE SHAKING HANDS

26:09.301 --> 26:11.871
AS IF WE'VE
JUST DONE A REALLY
IMPORTANT TRADE DEAL.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.141

PRIME MINISTER.
- YEAH, GOOD GOOD.

26:15.241 --> 26:18.410
OKAY, NOW LET'S GET

26:18.510 --> 26:20.913

26:21.013 --> 26:22.682
HE HAS GOT A GUN,
HASN'T HE?

26:22.782 --> 26:24.717
LET'S STAND AS IF
WE'RE CHARLIE'S ANGELS.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.085
'CAUSE THIS ONE'S
FOR MY KID'S ROOM.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.287
REALLY BIG "CHARLIE'S
ANGELS" FAN. OKAY?

26:31.423 --> 26:33.225
OKAY, THAT WAS GREAT.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.628
NOW LET'S GET BONO
AND ELTON JOHN IN
FOR THE NEXT ONE.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.838
I KNEW IT--
A BLOODY GLITCH.
I KNEW IT!

26:47.573 --> 26:49.776
- HE'S GOING FOR THE EDGE!
GO AND GET HIM, GREG!
- ( all gasp )

26:49.876 --> 26:52.178
- ( acoustic guitar playing )
- ( men vocalizing )

26:58.484 --> 27:01.053
HEY, JEMAINE.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.556
YOU'RE HOME...
EARLY.

27:04.657 --> 27:09.729
- HEY.
- THESE ARE SOME
OF MY NEW FRIENDS.

27:09.829 --> 27:14.166
BRET, ARE YOU REHEARSING
PAUL SIMON'S SOLO STUFF?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.770
( softly ) NO.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.206
( "Demon Woman" playing )

27:31.550 --> 27:33.853
( Jemaine's laughter
echoing )
