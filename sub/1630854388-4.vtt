WEBVTT

00:11.136 --> 00:13.013
Whoo!

00:13.096 --> 00:14.431
Yeah!

00:14.514 --> 00:16.558
You found my secret Yelp profile?

00:17.183 --> 00:19.436
That's the only place
I can be my unfiltered self.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.687
I'm a truth teller.

00:20.770 --> 00:24.190
-This is sincere. We're happy for you.
-I'll be on Yelp.

00:24.274 --> 00:28.028
Oh, never mind. I found it.
It's sadder than it is embarrassing.

00:28.111 --> 00:28.945
Don't read it.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.115
"It pains me to write this,
but I won't be returning to this QDOBA"?

00:32.198 --> 00:36.369
You got nominated for an Itsy Bizzie.
Iron Creek Small Business Awards.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.830
-Congrats!
-Percy's gonna be so jealous.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.416
I hope he tackles you during the ceremony.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.209
This is unexpected.

00:43.835 --> 00:47.756
We are technically a small business now
and I'm doing pretty well,

00:47.839 --> 00:49.174
but not award-winning well.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.426
You sure this isn't
the Itsy Bizzie Razzies?

00:51.509 --> 00:55.263
I got nominated for an Itsy Bizzie.
Me and Raul's tuxedo shop.

00:55.346 --> 01:00.643
We dressed the Grand Rapids High School
mariachi band for the state finals. Yeah.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.481
When it came to awards campaigning,
we refused to play the game.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.859
I got way more to focus on
than a stupid award.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.696
This stupid award
comes with a $5,000 prize.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.240
And the Golden Business spider trophy

01:14.324 --> 01:17.494
which could fetch upwards
of 30 bucks on Craigslist.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.579
Fifty, if you find a spider freak.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.874
The Bizzie goes to a small business owner
who knows what they're doing.

01:22.957 --> 01:26.628
Like my dentist, Dr. Kingsley,
has a waterfall in his lobby.

01:26.711 --> 01:29.297
That's small business ownership.
I'll never win.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.216
But you gotta try. Right?

01:31.299 --> 01:35.095
Can you imagine what you could do
with $5,000, Timmy?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.888
Any ideas come to mind?

01:36.971 --> 01:39.432
-Nope, because everything's fine.
-Really?

01:39.516 --> 01:42.602
You sure
there's no extremely urgent issues

01:42.685 --> 01:44.771
you'd like to evict from your life?

01:44.854 --> 01:46.856
I've got everything under control,

01:46.940 --> 01:49.234
and even if I didn't,
my time would be better spent

01:49.317 --> 01:51.861
getting it under control
rather than chasing a long shot.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.614
Again, none of that matters.
Everything is under control!

01:54.697 --> 01:55.824
That's reassuring.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.661
Speaking of urgent, I found a yogurt cup
under my driver's seat that's weirdly hot.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.287
So peace.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.749
-Let me help you with the yogurt!
-I said I've got it.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.920
How is this thing leaking so much?
No one has anything to worry about!

02:10.797 --> 02:12.382
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:16.427 --> 02:19.931
Man, if I won 5 grand
I would buy a good camera.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.266
Selfish.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.936
You could use that money to help someone,
like my sister.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.271
I'd use it to pay her bail.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.356
She's been in a Guatemalan jail
for a decade.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.151
How have you not come up
with that money in ten years?

02:31.234 --> 02:34.404
Ehh. Not a financial priority.
More of a splurge purchase.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.823
Hannah, what would you do
if you won 5K?

02:36.906 --> 02:38.324
Uh, no, thank you.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.744
You hear horror stories
about people winning the lottery.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.915
A lot of them end up dead
and some even buy houses in Florida.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.835
There's a big difference
between 5,000 and the Powerball.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.421
Not me. I don't wanna see
what's at the end of the road

02:51.504 --> 02:54.382
for someone who suddenly feels
like she can buy brand-name soup.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.093
Next thing you know,
I'm ordering shrimp on my nachos.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.387
Convince Chris to come home. "Look, Chris,

02:59.470 --> 03:01.264
I finally bought us a mattress.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.599
I'm a new Danielle!"

03:05.685 --> 03:07.896
You got any movies about Simon Birch?

03:14.861 --> 03:16.863
Somebody looks hungry.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.781
Not the time or place, Percy.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.617
11:45 by a dumpster,

03:20.700 --> 03:23.328
perfect conditions
for half a meatball sub.

03:24.829 --> 03:28.041
Okay. Look.
I'm sorry about the whole rent situation.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.168
I'm a small business owner too.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.420
If I give all my friends a break,
it'll ruin me!

03:32.503 --> 03:35.215
-I'm very popular.
-I get that you're strict about the rent.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.009
But why'd you handle it
in such a cowardly way?

03:38.092 --> 03:39.802
There's a simple explanation.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.179
I'm a coward.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.057
If you'd given me a heads-up,
I'd have more time.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.767
But I'll get you the money.

03:45.850 --> 03:49.395
I'm up for an Itsy Bizzie.
Maybe the other nominees will die.

03:49.979 --> 03:50.939
IB noms are out?

03:51.022 --> 03:53.024
Short for Itsy Bizzie nomination.

03:53.107 --> 03:56.194
Sounds like I made it up. I didn't.
I could've made it up. I didn't.

03:56.277 --> 04:00.240
I didn't get into the small business
game for acclaim. Good luck.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.951
-Still want that sandwich?
-Never wanted it.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.913
I didn't expect jealousy
to destroy you this fast.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.873
You found out you didn't get nominated,

04:08.957 --> 04:12.502
and you're offering people food
behind a strip mall. Damn.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.338
This is an unrelated apology sub.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.091
And I don't have time
for any award show B.S.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.884
It would've been tough to fit it in

04:19.968 --> 04:23.346
between standing by the trash
and holding an old sandwich.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.225
This is one of many things
on my calendar today,

04:27.308 --> 04:28.977
so I really don't have time to chat.

04:29.060 --> 04:29.936
Sorry.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.940
It's not old.
This sandwich was made an hour ago.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.442
You can go ask Paul
over at Sandwich Hell.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.030
I thought you told me about the eviction
because you wanted help.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.949
No, I told you because I'm terrified.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.994
Look, I'm sorry I pushed you
in front of everyone,

04:46.077 --> 04:47.620
but you gotta win this.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.706
The money could easily cover rent.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.292
I wouldn't nominate you
if I didn't think you could win.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.961
-You nominated me?
-Who else would have?

04:55.044 --> 04:57.338
That came out harsher than I expected.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.382
Well, me. I nominated me.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.467
What? Why didn't you tell us?

05:01.551 --> 05:03.011
It's embarrassing.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.929
I didn't think I'd get picked.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.557
Look at me.
Tomorrow, my mom's forcing me

05:07.640 --> 05:10.560
to tech her Korean church production
of <i>The Vagina Monologues.</i>

05:10.643 --> 05:12.979
That's why you have
an inflatable labia in your car.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.148
I've been turned down by six therapists.

05:15.940 --> 05:19.110
Now I know you nominated me,
I'll disappoint you too.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.737
No one takes me seriously.

05:21.529 --> 05:24.115
You are not going to disappoint me.

05:24.198 --> 05:27.660
Honestly, I think it's impressive
that you took initiative.

05:28.453 --> 05:32.165
Look, you're a great boss
with a great story,

05:32.248 --> 05:34.792
besides there's only five other nominees.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.879
I guarantee
the guy who owns the tropical fish store

05:37.962 --> 05:41.049
got some weird sex scandal
that's waiting to blow up.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.217
You don't own
that many saltwater aquariums

05:43.301 --> 05:45.136
without things getting nasty.

05:45.219 --> 05:49.474
Ready or not, the Chamber of Commerce
is sending a camera crew for an interview.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.225
So you can look like a slob,

05:51.309 --> 05:54.896
or look like an up-and-coming
pillar of the community.

05:54.979 --> 05:55.897
I look like a slob?

05:55.980 --> 05:59.525
You don't look as sexy as Trent,
he's the tropical fish guy.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.986
I know him,
but everything's aboveboard between us.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.447
You need a little sprucing up, Timmy.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.657
A little "fake it till you make it."

06:06.741 --> 06:09.660
Act like one of your favorite bosses
from a movie.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.121
Like <i>Boss Baby</i> or <i>Devil's Advocate?</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:14.749
One of those is a baby and one is Satan.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.794
And look at the heights they reach
despite their circumstances.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.797
Hmm. Fair. Maybe a makeover could help.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.298
A makeover?

06:22.382 --> 06:26.219
Uh, maybe something simple.
<i>She's All That</i> style.

06:26.302 --> 06:30.390
Nerd takes off the glasses
but still remains true to who they are.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.059
He's in khakis and smells like hot yogurt.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.937
This is more of
a <i>Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead,</i>

06:36.020 --> 06:39.649
which I was sure was a true crime doc.
But by the time I realized it wasn't,

06:39.732 --> 06:43.528
I was spellbound by the story
of those morally compromised teens.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.572
So in this analogy,
corporate is the babysitter

06:46.656 --> 06:48.825
and I'm Christina Applegate.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.995
Who lies about who she is to
make her way to the top, but ultimately--

06:53.079 --> 06:55.748
Has a lot of fun
and learned valuable lessons.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.127
-Maybe a haircut.
-I know the perfect place.

07:02.839 --> 07:07.176
I can fit you in between a Havanese
and a real butthole of a Labradoodle.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.429
Rene, you don't even
have your barber's license.

07:09.512 --> 07:14.434
I don't have my bark-ber's license either.
I'm not legally allowed to groom dogs.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.854
-Oh. Do I smell hot yogurt?
-That's me.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.356
So sweet how he covers for you.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.652
Okay, well,
I will have him back to you in an hour.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.619
<i>I'm Floy Beckamfillingin</i>
<i>for Miranda Golder...</i>

07:33.703 --> 07:37.331
-I thought your shift was over.
-Can't say no to a free lunch.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.042
-What are you reading?
-Uh, something for school.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.545
I don't get why you're getting
a degree in accounting.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.964
All you do is talk about making movies.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.383
Accounting is like the film of numbers.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.760
Every spreadsheet tells a story. See?

07:58.436 --> 08:02.523
Ew. Your cheapness is out of control.
You need to learn some self-care.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.067
You're a white woman.
You should be an assassin at it.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.403
I don't know. My life is cushy as is.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.323
Last week I bought detergent
that wasn't on sale.

08:10.406 --> 08:14.368
By accident. Still, it's a sign
of how loose I've gotten with cash.

08:14.452 --> 08:18.164
Okay, if you can take a bite
of whatever the hell that is

08:18.247 --> 08:21.501
and genuinely tell me you like it,
I'll leave you alone.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.545
Otherwise,
pick one self-care activity to do today.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.720
-Yeah.
-Fine.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.555
-Yeah.
-I'll go and--

08:34.639 --> 08:37.099
You're about to say "walk",
I'm cutting you off.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.228
On a walk to the...

08:42.980 --> 08:43.814
nail salon.

08:43.898 --> 08:48.110
Great. I'm gonna spend my break
making sure you don't hide in your car.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.697
Just spit it out. Please, spit it out.

08:52.823 --> 08:53.658
Ew.

08:53.741 --> 08:58.329
Hey! Not bad, huh?
Check out your new Blockbuster daddy.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.749
It was my idea for Rene
to use flea shampoo as volumizer.

09:01.832 --> 09:05.253
It burns a little, but I can't remember
the last time my hair had this body.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.214
I'm impressed
you're really trying to win this,

09:08.297 --> 09:10.591
but you don't have to change.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.260
The camera crew's here.

09:13.135 --> 09:16.180
Okay. Tim, relax, be yourself.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.850
You love this place.
You treat customers like your friends.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.769
-Your story is heartwarming.

09:21.852 --> 09:22.812
Wrong.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.689
-Is that a parrot?
-I got duck.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.191
It was a buzzer.
Has no one seen <i>Jeopardy?</i>

09:28.025 --> 09:30.152
People don't want their hearts warm.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.904
They want their minds blown!

09:31.988 --> 09:33.281
WWBBD?

09:34.615 --> 09:36.242
"What Would Boss Baby Do?"

09:36.325 --> 09:39.996
Yeah. Eliza, your plan seems nice,
but I've tried nice.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.583
If we're gonna stay in business,
we need to stop being polite and get real.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.585
-<i>The Real World</i> tagline?
-Yeah.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.963
-Tell me, who deserves that Itsy Bizzie?
-I do!

09:49.046 --> 09:52.008
-Who's the Golden Business Spider?
-I am!

09:52.091 --> 09:54.176
Um, I'm the Golden Business Spider?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.261
-Right!
-Yeah.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.263
What are you gonna say
to that camera crew?

09:57.346 --> 09:59.098
Welcome to my playground.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.144
That is not Timmy.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.687
These are my people.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.023
No, it's a supernova.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.902
Ew. Look at this shade of yellow.
"Smoker's Finger."

10:11.986 --> 10:15.364
Cute. Here's a pretty blue
called "Taken by an Avalanche."

10:15.448 --> 10:17.325
See, we're already having fun.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.785
Yeah. But I'm overwhelmed.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.953
Don't stress,

10:21.037 --> 10:23.873
self-care should be relaxing and fun.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.459
-That's the name of this color.
-That's not the color.

10:26.542 --> 10:30.212
That's the brand. Relaxing and Fun
is wet n wild's line for people over 40.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.049
I've always thought of myself
as over 40 at heart.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.216
Decisions.

10:34.300 --> 10:38.179
Um, I can take it from here.
Don't you have to study?

10:38.262 --> 10:40.431
No, we're focusing on you today.

10:40.931 --> 10:44.602
Ooh. I think I found my shade.
"Could be Fungal."

10:44.685 --> 10:46.520
Ooh.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.523
I am so glad they sprung for a good DP.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.192
DP is the Director of Photography.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.945
There's no worse sound in the world
than a man describing film terms.

10:55.029 --> 10:58.741
You know you don't have
to change yourself for this, right?

10:58.824 --> 11:01.702
Look, I have to win,
so I'm acting like a winner.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.289
I want you to win too.
It's how your rent problem goes away.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.792
I don't want you
to lose focus on yourself.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.627
I am laser focused.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.129
Maybe not as focused
as Rick's camera was.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.881
He made me look good.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.759
But believe me,
I am very focused on myself,

11:16.842 --> 11:18.135
my best self.

11:18.219 --> 11:22.014
The babysitter's dead and I'm going
to have a summer to remember.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.140
He's done it!

11:23.933 --> 11:25.601
Our boy's gone viral.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.729
This morning, you had 144 followers,

11:28.813 --> 11:31.399
now 147.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.110
-Ho!
-That says 145.

11:34.193 --> 11:38.572
Huh. Lost two. When you reach
these heights, backlash is inevitable.

11:39.407 --> 11:43.160
Connie, I was just talking to Timmy
about staying focused on--

11:43.244 --> 11:44.995
Winning. Couldn't agree more.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.790
It's a crucial moment
in any awards campaign.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.626
This is when we bring out the big guns!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.169
Gift bags for voters.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.129
Gift bags?

11:53.212 --> 11:54.839
You sweet naive thing.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.216
Every award is bought and paid for.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.845
Actually, I don't think
we should give the voters gifts, Con.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.223
We should bring them to the gift.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.184
An elegant evening at Blockbuster.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.520
The student has become the teacher.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.731
We have some event planning to do.

12:14.608 --> 12:19.321
So would you like a mani beaucoup,
pedi mort, or upper lip wax?

12:20.072 --> 12:23.159
Uh, these bottles
of Self-Worth Comes From Within,

12:23.242 --> 12:27.371
-Influencer Beige, Disgraced Girl Boss.
-I thought we were getting mani-pedis!

12:27.455 --> 12:30.124
I can get three bottles
for the same price as a manicure

12:30.207 --> 12:32.084
and do my nails at home.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.463
Maybe this home-school graduate
can teach you a thing about accounting.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.340
Fine, at least
you're doing some self-care.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.968
What you're describing is piracy.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.971
You're taking food
out of my birds' mouths.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.891
In that case, don't sell these to me.
Let's go.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.309
No, no, no. It's fine.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.395
That'll be 29.60.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.230
I'll be paying with this.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.650
A gift certificate?
The only reason you picked this place

12:56.734 --> 12:58.903
is because you wouldn't
have to spend any money?

12:58.986 --> 13:01.906
-That's cheating.
-Read the back of this for me.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.908
"Treat as you would real money."

13:05.034 --> 13:06.535
Caught on a technicality.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.746
I'd like my change back in fives.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.539
-It's 40 cents.
-I know.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.249
I want nickels.

13:15.169 --> 13:18.964
Wow, you guys really got
a lot of decorations for this party.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.801
Um, I think these are meant
for a quinceañera.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.553
Never hurts to seem young
and full of promise.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.513
Exactly.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.516
Okay. And this?

13:28.599 --> 13:32.228
The voting committee should feel
the balance of fear and gratitude

13:32.311 --> 13:35.481
that comes with
spending Thanksgiving with family.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.526
-Oh. Timothy.
-Percival.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.944
I heard you went to my store.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.696
Ugh. Grand Mill gossip really gets around.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.242
We are throwing a soiree
for my Itsy Bizzie nom tomorrow.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.370
I remember those days
when my business was still small enough

13:49.453 --> 13:53.624
to be considered for such an award.
Success is a double-edged sword.

13:58.462 --> 14:02.049
And look at you now.
Big enough to evict a friend.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.977
-Ooh. I just realized something.
-We need candles. Right?

14:13.060 --> 14:15.813
All the<i> Devil's Advocate</i> parties
were oozing with them.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.774
I read in <i>Parade Magazine</i>
that Pacino brought candles from home.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.611
Don't you guys think
Blockbuster has its own nostalgic charm,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.739
and all this stuff
might get in the way of that?

14:26.657 --> 14:29.827
Percival, does your un-nominated store
offer delivery?

14:29.910 --> 14:32.371
We are gonna need
your waxiest of candles.

14:38.586 --> 14:42.506
Hello. Oh, Madam Secretary,
thank you so much for coming out.

14:42.590 --> 14:47.469
Treasurer O'Brien, I'll tell you again,
we do not have a discount for male models.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.388
Who here matters?

14:49.471 --> 14:50.723
Can you up the lights?

14:50.806 --> 14:52.766
Customers are having trouble
finding movies.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.811
A lady knocked over
three shelves of new releases.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.814
First two were by accident,
but the last one was out of anger.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.982
Oh, you two.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.319
Anything worth finding
is worth searching for.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.156
Also, I love what the soft glow
is doing for my complexion.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.367
Floy Beckam?
The stars really are out tonight.

15:13.454 --> 15:17.917
-Uh, does Timmy seem off to you?
-He's a different person. I've been--

15:18.000 --> 15:20.127
He's kissing Floy Beckam on the cheek.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.297
Nope, he's moving towards the lips.
I should step in.

15:29.386 --> 15:32.139
So I see that you're washing garbage.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.933
-These are almost brand-new.
-I know.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.726
Pass them down to your grandchildren.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.187
I don't know if I'll have grandchildren.

15:38.270 --> 15:42.650
If I do, they'll be inheriting
my collection of Arby's Christmas goblets.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.152
I let the nail salon slide,
but this is too much.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.780
Next time you're at my house
you can drink from the hose.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.907
Your cheapness is pathological.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.200
What do you care?

15:51.283 --> 15:54.161
Look, money has always been tight
with my family.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.664
I've been counting coupons since I was 8.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.500
So I'm frugal.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.210
Isn't it better to be careful?

16:01.293 --> 16:03.712
I get careful, but it controls your life.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.882
You won't check out DVDs
and we get them for free.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.051
It is our one employee benefit.

16:09.134 --> 16:12.638
I don't wanna burn out my DVD player.
I've only had it since 2009.

16:12.721 --> 16:13.806
You'll wake up one day

16:13.889 --> 16:17.101
and realize you went ten years
without ordering shrimp on your nachos!

16:17.184 --> 16:18.102
A life wasted.

16:18.185 --> 16:21.397
Hey, I'm just sacrificing for my future.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.274
Like you
with that accounting school you hate.

16:25.109 --> 16:29.279
I do not hate accounting.
You have no idea what you're saying.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.280
Big surprise.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.743
If shrimp nachos are so important,
order them yourself, bro.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.872
Just don't come crying to me
when I'm on my flight to San Diego.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.458
That's right, San Diego.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.293
The one with the zoo.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.797
The big future you're saving up for
is a three-night stay in San Diego?

16:47.756 --> 16:49.466
Enjoy being miserable till then.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.427
It's four nights!

16:51.510 --> 16:53.929
And I'll be too busy mapping out my day

16:54.013 --> 16:57.850
at their world-class safari park
to be miserable.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.573
So still not jealous?

17:12.656 --> 17:15.784
Of this lame-ass party?
Look at all this junk in here.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.872
That they got at your store.
Okay, look, I'm sorry, that wasn't fair.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.583
This must be hard for you.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.460
You do so much for Timmy.

17:24.543 --> 17:28.047
Propping him up as a business owner,
you get no recognition.

17:28.130 --> 17:33.510
Things between us have been complicated.
It's hard to be the guy behind the guy.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.972
I guess I am a little jealous.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.728
So you admit it. I got you again.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.313
What a small man.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.648
-Have a nice night, Percy.
-It's "Dad."

17:46.732 --> 17:49.151
I told you about calling me Percy. Hey.

17:52.446 --> 17:57.034
Sorry, the computer seems to be dead.
Chocolate fountain must've blown a fuse.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.412
So I have to talk to my parents
while they're visiting?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.790
Let me go try to fix it.

18:02.873 --> 18:07.086
Remember, young lady, R-rated movies
require a parent or legal guardian.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.798
Mine have been dead for decades.
You have my vote, handsome.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.674
-Oh.
-Timmy, we're having an issue.

18:12.758 --> 18:17.596
I haven't seen you in forever.
What have you been working on?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.473
-It's Connie.
-Oh.

18:19.556 --> 18:23.018
I might have known if it weren't so dark.
I thought you were on candle duty.

18:23.102 --> 18:27.106
There's a difference between
being a guest and working a party, babe.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.565
Did you call me "babe"?

18:29.191 --> 18:33.153
-And is that a diamond bracelet?
-Rhinestone dog collar from Rene.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.489
You might've known if it weren't what?

18:35.572 --> 18:37.407
-Dark.
-That's my girl.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.287
Who needs to be filled to the brim
with the magic of Tim?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.832
Congrats, Dr. Frankenstein.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.043
Instead of being himself,
like I encouraged him to be,

18:48.127 --> 18:49.670
he's now a monster.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.672
Only a matter of time before he--

18:51.755 --> 18:54.049
Drowns a little girl?
I thought the same thing.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.467
But which little girl,

18:55.551 --> 18:58.095
and in which of
our state's countless lakes?

18:58.178 --> 19:00.973
I was gonna say
"before he absconds to the arctic."

19:01.056 --> 19:04.726
Always thinking of an excuse to say you
read the book instead of seeing the movie.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.147
Fine. Maybe I pushed him too hard.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.358
I just finally wanted to win one of these.

19:11.441 --> 19:12.860
But I'll go talk to him.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.949
The store is on fire!

19:20.075 --> 19:21.785
-Go, go, go!
-Come with me.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.176
Okay, so who's the dickbag
that owns this place?

19:38.427 --> 19:39.344
I'll say that again.

19:39.428 --> 19:43.223
Who's the dickbag who owns this place?
They didn't send me not to find a dickbag.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.100
I'm the dickbag who owns it.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.103
And I'm the dickbag behind the dickbag.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.355
I created this monster.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.692
-Arrest me, officers.
-We're the fire department.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.402
Have you guys seen Hannah?

19:55.485 --> 19:57.696
Oh, she went to the bar for a drink.

19:57.779 --> 20:02.075
Oh, great. This is my curse.
My hot takes drive people to drink.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.375
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.506
Um, I just wanted to say that...

20:17.633 --> 20:19.218
-I'm--
-Enjoy.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.928
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.388
Are those shrimp nachos?

20:26.141 --> 20:29.353
When the store caught fire,
I realized you were right.

20:29.436 --> 20:34.399
I should treat myself a little more
'cause tomorrow isn't promised.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.612
I came here for a drink,

20:38.695 --> 20:42.407
then realized the nachos
were 2 bucks cheaper, but baby steps.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.327
What did you wanna say?

20:46.578 --> 20:49.873
I shouldn't have been hard on you.
Your financial stuff is your business.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.543
And you were right.
I'm no better. I, uh...

20:55.003 --> 20:57.047
-I hate accounting.
-Oh, yeah.

20:57.130 --> 21:00.676
You changed the subject to my cheapness
this morning to avoid talking about it.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.220
You noticed? I thought I was so subtle.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.806
You'd be surprised by the things I notice.

21:05.889 --> 21:06.932
Oh--

21:08.016 --> 21:09.351
You'd be surprised.

21:11.186 --> 21:14.856
I'm sorry.
I was projecting my own stuff onto you.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.569
It's just, children of immigrants
don't really get to have dreams.

21:19.653 --> 21:20.654
It's complicated.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.991
Well, let's just agree

21:24.074 --> 21:28.245
that we both need to try to have
a little more shrimp on our nachos.

21:28.328 --> 21:29.162
Cool?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.540
Now, dig in!

21:34.293 --> 21:37.170
Oh, I love the play
of textures and temperatures.

21:37.963 --> 21:38.964
These are frozen.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.927
I've got some great news.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.513
-I won the Itsy Bizzie?
-No. No?

21:46.596 --> 21:48.598
No, you've been blacklisted.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.977
Hmm. You were saying there was good news.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.478
Yes. Right.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.981
The fire department isn't gonna fine you.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.400
Turns out strip mall carpet is toxic,

21:58.483 --> 22:01.528
so it counts as their disaster training
this year.

22:01.611 --> 22:05.532
No one can ever accuse me
of not supporting our first responders.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.745
Listen, I'm so sorry
about getting out of control today.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.914
I didn't wanna lose that prize money.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.876
And... I didn't wanna let you down.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.419
So you did both.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.880
Shrewd. Hey, let me help you with this.

22:19.963 --> 22:24.217
Oh, you know, I get what
Christina Applegate was going through.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.637
The babysitter dies,
then suddenly you're the babysitter?

22:27.721 --> 22:31.099
It's a heavy burden.
Still trying to figure it all out.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.101
You did save the day at the end.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.396
That's something.
What are you gonna do about the rent?

22:36.480 --> 22:40.817
I gotta sacrifice something,
so I am putting my Mitsubishi up for sale.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.235
Should buy me a few months

22:42.319 --> 22:44.529
while I figure
this small business thing out.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.031
Wait! The Eclipse?

22:46.114 --> 22:49.326
-But you love that car.
-Yeah, it's pretty cherry.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.286
But I love the store more.

22:51.912 --> 22:52.829
And you all.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.333
Wow. Spoken like
a true small business owner.

22:57.292 --> 23:02.506
Well, as sad as it is knowing I'll never
get to go for another 'bishi ride, thanks.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.342
You're the real Itsy Bizzie winner
in my eyes.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.760
Really. What do I win?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.806
I could buy you a drink.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.224
Yes, please.

23:16.311 --> 23:21.316
You want a pre-drink chocolate,
banana, marshmallow, or prosciutto?

23:21.400 --> 23:24.194
Mm. You leave one of those unplugged
for more five minutes,

23:24.277 --> 23:26.279
they become a breeding ground
for mosquitoes.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.073
Ruined my cousin's wedding.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.326
This could legally
be classified as swampland.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.248
You need to get that?

23:36.331 --> 23:37.165
Uh...

23:37.833 --> 23:40.377
Yeah, I probably should.
I'll just be a sec.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.295
Hey, goose!

23:44.714 --> 23:46.049
When I said I'd move back in,

23:46.133 --> 23:49.094
you promised you'd move the PS5
out of the bedroom.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.805
I cannot get addicted to <i>GTA</i> online again.

23:54.057 --> 23:54.891
Okay.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.187
Ready for that trophy drink?

23:59.271 --> 24:02.774
Um, I totally forgot
I have something I have to do.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.234
Oh.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.446
Okay. Next time then?

24:07.529 --> 24:08.822
Mm-hm.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.293
-Hey.
-Timmy.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.920
Hey, man. I'm sorry, okay?

24:25.130 --> 24:28.383
-At least let me--
-Forget it. I'll get you the rent.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.637
I need to get drunk
with my best friend, if that's cool?

24:33.680 --> 24:34.681
That's very cool.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.559
Give it up.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.144
Oh!

24:39.227 --> 24:40.645
Here's the big question.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.316
First round on you,
or the last round on you?

24:44.399 --> 24:48.445
I think first round on you
and last round on you.

24:48.528 --> 24:51.156
I might not remember
the last round.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.073
Okay.
