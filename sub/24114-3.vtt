WEBVTT

00:08.049 --> 00:10.719
<i>-Previously on You Me Her...</i>
-I need a plan.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.012
-Yeah, no shit.
-Some way to get the two of them

00:13.138 --> 00:15.181
alone in an enclosed space.

00:15.306 --> 00:16.474
Is that your dad?

00:16.558 --> 00:17.851
-I'm sober.

00:17.934 --> 00:20.437
-A little over a year.
-Wow. Only 26 years too late.

00:20.562 --> 00:23.148
<i>The State of the Millennial Man,</i>
that's my thesis.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.191
I should meet
all of my dates the same way.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.652
Right here, not too late,
not too early.

00:27.777 --> 00:28.945
When did you stop wanting kids?

00:29.029 --> 00:31.364
It just kind of happened
gradually over the years.

00:31.489 --> 00:34.284
Have you guys talked about
some version of child care?

00:34.409 --> 00:37.120
We're more talking about
talking about it.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.290
We can't publish almost-finished
theatre reviews.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.416
Yeah.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.042
Divorce signing thing still on
for Monday?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.586
Oh, buddy, is that what this is about?

00:44.669 --> 00:47.005
I just want to make sure
that we're still on for Monday.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.423
Yeah. We are totally a go.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.220
You hired an escort
to get your groove back,

00:54.345 --> 00:57.182
then you got down on your fucking knees
and begged her to have your baby.

00:57.265 --> 01:00.060
-You owe me 12 fucking years.
-Fuck you!

01:05.106 --> 01:06.775
What the fuck?

01:15.784 --> 01:16.868
Uh...

01:19.245 --> 01:21.456
Babe, I don't know
how it happened, okay?

01:21.539 --> 01:23.875
One minute she was leaving,
and the next minute we were all...

01:24.793 --> 01:27.879
-Well, I guess you saw.
-Iz. Izzy, look at me.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.006
You cannot break up
with him over this.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.385
Do not tell me who I can
or cannot break up with

01:34.469 --> 01:35.720
for whatever fucking reason.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.138
No, I'm not telling you.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.182
I'm begging you.
Look, nothing's changed.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.975
I'm still in a committed
relationship in Seattle.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.519
You two are...

01:46.356 --> 01:48.566
Well, this day has really taken a turn.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.906
You started without me...

02:14.300 --> 02:15.927
Oh.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.142
Oh.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.435
Oh, fuck.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.783
Hey, babe.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.140
So, that happened.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.352
Oh, you're mad now?

03:07.395 --> 03:10.398
I thought this is exactly what you wanted
when you parent-trapped us.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.402
I was hoping to find you guys
making nice, not making out.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.614
You sure that's all
you were hoping for?

03:18.531 --> 03:22.410
Quit mining my subconscious motivations,
doctor dickhead.

03:22.952 --> 03:26.205
Did your subconscious
buy the beer, pizza and candy?

03:26.789 --> 03:29.792
-Oh, you think you're very funny.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.968
Em, are you okay?

03:39.093 --> 03:40.428
Was that Kylie?

03:40.762 --> 03:41.846
Yeah.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.473
Was she super pissed?

03:43.598 --> 03:46.059
No, because I just lied
my fucking ass off.

03:46.142 --> 03:49.562
Something I was really hoping to
eliminate as a defining character trait.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.982
Why lie to her? Why don't you
just tell her what happened?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.694
Because she's going back.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.239
Uh, what?

04:00.323 --> 04:01.366
No, you're not.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.201
I told you, Izzy,
this was a mistake.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.578
Whether it was the two of us
or the three of us,

04:05.703 --> 04:07.455
this never should have happened.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.377
Emma, could you just
slow down, okay?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.504
It's not like we're gonna
throw a net over you.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.838
Wait, wait.

04:16.881 --> 04:21.052
What the three of us did here was
special, and you're just gonna bounce?

04:21.177 --> 04:22.679
Are you kidding me?

04:23.471 --> 04:24.847
I'm happy in Seattle...

04:25.682 --> 04:26.641
at Pinnacle

04:27.684 --> 04:29.269
with Kylie.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.898
You guys make sense.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.901
I'm the piece that doesn't fit.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.120
We did this... together,

04:47.203 --> 04:48.913
all three of us.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.707
Not just you.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.336
But you're right.
It was a mistake.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.509
I guess I'll see you Monday.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.219
Yeah.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.601
Izzy?

05:11.894 --> 05:14.897
If you walk out that door,
don't call, don't text,

05:14.981 --> 05:17.233
and sure as fuck
don't think about dropping by.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.443
You are dead to me.

Emma?

06:14.207 --> 06:16.209
Ah... Hey, Carm.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.299
What exactly are you doing
on my front porch?

06:23.382 --> 06:24.967
Not much.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.595
Crying, mostly. Um...

06:29.222 --> 06:32.809
-Jack and Izzy--
-Oh, no. No, no, no.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.812
You do not get to show up here
after four fucking months

06:35.937 --> 06:37.939
and just pick this bullshit up
like you never left.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.566
Carm, I'm begging you.
I'm a disaster. Please.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.401
Uh, okay.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.821
I'm gonna count to five,
and then I'm gonna call the cops

06:44.904 --> 06:46.364
and say there's
a skinny white woman

06:46.447 --> 06:48.616
kneeling on the porch
of my mixed-race house.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.828
Yeah, well, let's just wait for them
to get here, and then we'll tell them

06:51.953 --> 06:53.621
I'm your best friend
because cops love that.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.790
Oh, didn't you hear?
I have a new best friend now,

06:55.873 --> 06:58.543
and she's way cooler
than the old one.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.170
Oh, is this Emma?

07:01.295 --> 07:02.630
Hi, Emma!

07:03.881 --> 07:05.842
So, why is she kneeling?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.096
Oh, yikes. Never seen her like that.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.642
-Oh, I'm Hannah.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.104
So, Carmen tells me that
you are a late-onset lesbian.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.856
That is so cool.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.984
-I can't...
-It's... it's just so brave.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.360
Carm!

07:24.444 --> 07:25.486
Oh.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.910
You weren't
100% sure it was over.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.582
No.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.674
But now I am.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.055
Are we doing the thing?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.807
The telepathy thing? I believe so.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.106
Here, try it.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.733
What am I thinking?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.990
How much you love me.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.493
-Oh.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.329
Your turn.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.252
The same, I hope.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.504
No.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.298
I was thinking you should go
get us some Indian food.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.053
I'm kidding.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.430
I was thinking the same thing.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.644
Although now that I've said it, the
Indian food concept sounds pretty good.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.728
Mm.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.790
Are you serious
What is this, junior high?

09:00.915 --> 09:04.252
-Oh, no. I'm sure we can give you a--
-No, this is for work.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.045
Hannah and I are reviewing

09:06.170 --> 09:09.590
a very nice Wilhelma Valley Syrah
for <i>The Heights.</i>

09:09.715 --> 09:11.676
Okay, well, there is so little
in that sentence

09:11.759 --> 09:13.761
-that made sense to me.
-Gee, I wonder why.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.305
Okay, ladies.
I am sensing some seriously

09:16.389 --> 09:18.683
complicated relationship
dynamics here.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.561
Emma, I need you to know I am
not trying to poach your bestie.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.437
Who is she?
Who are you again?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.064
I'm Hannah.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.775
H-Hannah.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.152
Paul got transferred to Dallas.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.322
The Matherfields moved
and Hannah came into my life

09:33.406 --> 09:35.700
-just when I needed her most.
-Aww.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.743
And now we're starting
a magazine together.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.329
I mean, with my Internet following
and Carmen's writing experience,

09:40.413 --> 09:43.124
the idea kind of came up with itself.

09:46.460 --> 09:50.006
Whoa, okay, that's
right up in my personal space.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.674
Carmen Mae Amari,

09:51.757 --> 09:54.135
from the bottom of my heart
and the depths of my soul,

09:54.218 --> 09:58.347
I am so, so sorry for crawling so far up
my own ass that all I could see was...

09:58.723 --> 09:59.724
Your colon?

10:02.935 --> 10:04.854
Look, I never should have
pulled away like that,

10:04.937 --> 10:07.315
but everything here reminded me
of everything else here.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.733
Okay, just for scheduling purposes,

10:08.816 --> 10:10.901
how much longer are you
gonna be holding my face?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.571
Until you begin the process
of forgiving me.

10:14.655 --> 10:18.659
I can't stand it when you're mad at me.
I mean, I physically cannot stand it.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.537
You're a dick.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.248
Yeah, I'm a ginormous dick.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.376
And I know it's gonna take you
a while to forgive me, but--

10:27.501 --> 10:28.961
Okay. That's all I wanted to hear.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.922
Oh, thank you. I love you.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.299
Oh.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.634
Oh... Ladies...

10:38.304 --> 10:39.805
Okay. So, this is happening.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.849
Just let it happen.
She's a world-class hugger.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.644
Mm. When I spent
a summer living in a lavra

10:44.727 --> 10:46.854
-with Romanian hermits, I learned so--
-Hannah,

10:46.937 --> 10:49.565
I'm sure Carm's right and you're
really cool and everything,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.401
but I'm gonna need you
to disengage and give us a minute.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.861
And by "give us a minute,"

10:53.944 --> 10:56.572
I mean you got to go.
No offence.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.574
I totally understand.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.077
Oh. Okay.

11:02.953 --> 11:03.871
I love you.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.581
Well, I'm very lovable.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.679
Remember when you said
that I can't just drop in

11:20.805 --> 11:22.765
and dump throuple bullshit on you.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.310
-It seems longer.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.813
So here's the thing.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.066
I threw an octopus at Jack's head.
I had sex with him and Izzy.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.027
Izzy said if I walked out the door,
I was dead to her.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.238
Which I obviously did
because I am now standing here

11:37.321 --> 11:40.241
with you drinking wine
like a huge dick.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.618
But enough about me.
How are you?

11:42.701 --> 11:45.246
Tell me about <i>The Heights.</i>
Do you really get paid to drink wine?

11:45.329 --> 11:47.706
Because that is awesome.

11:56.882 --> 12:01.303
Okay, so I'm still... struggling -
I don't know why - to understand,

12:02.096 --> 12:06.142
you guys hadn't spoken in months, but
then you pulled a quickie ménage and...

12:06.934 --> 12:10.229
Why did anybody think
that was a good idea?

12:10.354 --> 12:11.689
Okay, you know that
ridiculous movie thing

12:11.772 --> 12:13.816
where two people wake up
staring at the ceiling like,

12:13.899 --> 12:15.276
how the hell did this happen?

12:15.359 --> 12:18.237
You know, like they just got
sucked up into a giant sex tornado?

12:18.362 --> 12:19.488
Okay.

12:19.613 --> 12:22.074
Yeah, okay, it is so real,
even with three people.

12:24.118 --> 12:27.872
But you're still getting divorced Monday
and driving back to Seattle?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.373
Yes.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.750
Okay.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.377
Okay.

12:33.961 --> 12:38.174
Hey. Look, Dave speaks to Jack
all the time, right, so he'd know.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.843
Jack and Izzy really are happy?

12:40.968 --> 12:42.970
Yeah. I mean, they're... they're good.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.890
If that crazy throuple shit
just woke you up in a life

12:46.015 --> 12:47.308
you didn't want anymore,

12:47.391 --> 12:49.977
then dragging it out would have
only made things worse.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.689
Are you sure that you left
for the right reasons,

12:53.772 --> 12:56.859
and not just because you felt
like Jack left you first?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.405
Wash that around for a little bit

13:01.530 --> 13:04.742
because I'm gonna have
some words with Mr. Amari.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.037
Hey, hon.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.165
So, I start a business
and ask for some support,

13:11.248 --> 13:12.875
and suddenly you're
working on a Saturday,

13:12.958 --> 13:15.628
and you come home after
the girls are fed and in bed?

13:15.711 --> 13:18.047
I'm working on a pitch. You know
what that's like, right?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.882
Guys, you know what?
I'm gonna take a tour

13:19.965 --> 13:23.344
around the old hood, see if everything
really seems smaller, like they say.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.678
Good to see you.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.598
Sorry, Emma. I can't talk to you.
Team Jack, no offence.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.016
I get it.

13:31.393 --> 13:34.730
So you seriously think I stayed at work
late on a Saturday to piss you off?

13:34.813 --> 13:36.065
Okay.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.360
I seriously think that nobody
leaves this room

13:39.443 --> 13:41.570
until we agree on a plan
for the girls.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.407
Well, it's a good thing we came up with
a plan two years and nine months ago.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.742
Wow.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.619
That is some freaky ass shit.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.829
What, that I know my daughter's
age to the month?

13:50.955 --> 13:52.790
How much you sound
like your dad.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.626
That's not cool, okay?
I'm not like my dad.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.294
Just in case that wasn't clear,

13:57.378 --> 13:59.421
I'm talking about
your wildly misogynistic,

13:59.505 --> 14:01.507
but otherwise charming,
Turkish father.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.133
I am not like my father.

14:03.217 --> 14:08.055
I am progressive and evolved
and feminist A.F.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.391
Which I was recently
told stands for "as fuck."

14:10.474 --> 14:12.268
Okay, here's the thing.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.603
I'm not asking for permission.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.855
Okay, I think I get
what's happening here, all right?

14:16.939 --> 14:19.608
Hannah's life seems all shiny and perfect

14:19.692 --> 14:21.652
with her after-school care
and her imaginary husband,

14:21.735 --> 14:24.280
but I'm standing here
all three-dimensional

14:24.363 --> 14:26.156
with actual opinions
on my daughter's upbringing.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.868
Now, I was under the impression
that that's the way you liked it.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.453
Nobody twisted your arm.
We came up with this together.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.623
You think this has to do with Hannah?
This has nothing to do with Hannah,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.917
and I resent you being
so reductive about my feelings.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.961
Now...

14:39.086 --> 14:43.173
Me and this amazing Syrah
are gonna take a bath together,

14:43.257 --> 14:45.134
and you're gonna
clean the kitchen.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.143
Oh, bummer.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.020
-Good luck with that.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.622
I didn't know how you took it,
so I brought you cream and sugar.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.625
What's the idea here?

16:41.709 --> 16:43.502
I'm walking you to school.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.549
Well, I am walking
myself to a meeting.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.300
What you do is your call.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.636
-Free country and all that.
-Okay.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.144
God, this is so weird.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.447
I'm sure you know
why I wanted to see you today.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.576
Um, yeah. As you are my thesis advisor,
I would assume that it has to--

17:15.659 --> 17:17.703
Please tell me that
you're making progress.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.748
Oliver, how do I put this?

17:20.831 --> 17:25.711
Um, I am in the "ironing out
the details" phase.

17:25.836 --> 17:30.466
I'm just, like, hacking through
the tall grass of the, um...

17:31.550 --> 17:33.844
I've had a lot going on lately.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.722
Like last semester when
you more or less went AWOL?

17:36.847 --> 17:39.641
No, no, no.
This is... this is different.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.478
My dad, who was dead,
came back to life...

17:43.604 --> 17:45.022
like Jesus.

17:46.106 --> 17:50.569
Except my dad wasn't so much dead
as he was... dead to me.

17:50.652 --> 17:55.074
Izzy, I know having a resurrection
in the family must be very distracting.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.575
See? Thank you.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.868
Yes, of course.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.288
But writing and defending
a thesis is gruelling work.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.499
You're behind on your TA duties recently,

18:03.624 --> 18:05.501
and you haven't even started
community placement.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.588
Are you sure
this is still what you want?

18:10.506 --> 18:13.717
It is. It really, really is.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.303
Great!
Well, no time like the present.

18:16.386 --> 18:20.057
Let's reach out to a few of my contacts
who might have a slot for you.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.267
I mean, that's so cool
and proactive, Oliver.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.645
I mean, you're so good at your job.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.855
But the thing is, is I had
like a previous thing,

18:26.980 --> 18:29.942
and I'm gonna sit
until you're done.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.947
<i>How was your meeting</i>
<i>with Oliver?</i>

18:35.072 --> 18:37.407
Well, he went off on me.
Just like, no thesis topic,

18:37.491 --> 18:41.245
no community placement,
worst TA ever, blah, blah, blah.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.330
He's such a ball buster.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.999
Uh, what have you been doing?

18:47.543 --> 18:48.502
Well...

18:48.585 --> 18:51.213
Okay, you really need to get
your head out of your ass, sister.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.674
Before you know it, you're gonna
be 35, married with kids,

18:53.757 --> 18:55.676
and every time you have
that second glass of Chard,

18:55.759 --> 18:58.262
you're gonna bore the living
shit out of the neighbour chicks

18:58.345 --> 19:00.681
with vows of some day
finishing your Ph.D.

19:00.764 --> 19:04.726
I know, I know. I'm actually
on my way to my first meeting

19:04.810 --> 19:07.479
at Directions Youth Services.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.065
It's a centre for homeless teenagers.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.276
You working at a soup kitchen
for street kids?

19:12.359 --> 19:15.988
I said youth centre, not soup kitchen.
What's your point?

19:16.238 --> 19:19.533
-Fuck soup. They are gonna eat you alive.
-Ugh.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.702
Jack and Emma signed
the papers today.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.913
It only took me six months, but
I finally destroyed their marriage.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.081
Bull fuck.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.500
Please use the more
conventional "bullshit."

19:28.584 --> 19:30.961
Bull fuck belongs
in that sex dictionary

19:31.044 --> 19:34.173
with Cleveland steamer
and dirty Sanchez.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.175
Okay, look.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.262
Here's the true post-mortem
on the Trakarsky marriage:

19:40.596 --> 19:42.514
desperate suburban
married couple brings

19:42.598 --> 19:47.311
a young, mediocre-looking
escort into their marriage

19:47.394 --> 19:50.189
only to discover that the real problem
with their shitty sex life

19:50.272 --> 19:53.442
is that wifey's actually gay
and doesn't want kids.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.736
You were never the villain
in this picture.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.946
In the end, you guys
all made your own choices.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.531
Nobody got bull fucked.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.826
That works.
-Hmm, thanks.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.754
I was jacking around
with my friend's guitar,

20:13.837 --> 20:17.966
and he was, all,
"Bro, that's fucking amazing."

20:18.050 --> 20:22.971
Which is weird because, like,
I've never... taken a single lesson.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.641
Um, check it.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.563
Dude, that's
something special right there.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.108
Don't let anyone tell you different.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.365
-Yeah, crazy.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.285
Anyway, um, after you
swiped right

20:45.369 --> 20:48.121
and said you were
"way up into my ass..."

20:49.248 --> 20:53.919
...you left everything else up to me.
Date, time, place, all of it.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.003
Why is that?

20:56.129 --> 20:57.965
What's your point, Nana?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.512
It's <i>Nina,</i> you imbecile.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.347
Nana means grandma.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.016
Why would anybody name
their child Nana?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.601
Nana, that's awesome.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.603
God, what is wrong with
your entire generation of men?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.689
Should I just date grateful widowers

21:13.814 --> 21:17.150
and leave you goofy twats
to your vintage bicycles,

21:17.234 --> 21:20.529
multimedia projects
and ridiculous hats?

21:20.654 --> 21:22.155
Mm...

21:22.239 --> 21:23.824
Mm...

21:23.907 --> 21:25.409
Mm!

21:27.828 --> 21:28.954
What the fuck was that?

21:29.079 --> 21:30.247
Oh, I know.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.915
Maybe some fleeting
curiosity about me,

21:32.040 --> 21:35.210
like what I do or what I'm into
or anything about me.

21:35.294 --> 21:40.215
Well, actually, I just wrote
an entire song about this experience.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.634
Let's get you out of here before...

21:42.759 --> 21:45.429
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Whoa, wow.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.681
...before something worse happens.

21:47.806 --> 21:51.310
-Wow.
-Yeah, okay, off you go.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.562
Wow.
-Wow!
-Okay, take care.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.317
Don't deprive the world.
Oh, he's Snapchatting.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.908
And here is where they check
their email, Facebook, et cetera.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.411
We help them with résumés,
job applications,

22:09.494 --> 22:11.663
doctor's appointments,
that kind of thing.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.623
If anyone's looking
for an open shelter bed,

22:13.749 --> 22:15.876
or you ever have a question,
just grab one of us.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.504
Okay. Actually, I do just have
one question.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.341
What do I do
in the meantime?

22:22.424 --> 22:24.593
Hang out.
Get to know them.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.553
You'll be fine.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.352
Check it out.
New counsellor, comin' in hot!

22:35.312 --> 22:38.523
Hey! White guilt.
How's it going?

22:52.120 --> 22:54.790
-I'm hiding.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.026
Hey.

23:31.409 --> 23:34.329
-Okay.
You don't wanna?

23:34.412 --> 23:35.789
Oh, I definitely wanna.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.792
But first we're gonna talk about
what you just went through

23:38.875 --> 23:41.586
because that's what people do
when they're in a loving,

23:41.670 --> 23:45.048
-Yeah.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.467
Scotch?

23:48.635 --> 23:49.636
Big yeah.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.942
What?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.444
-Nothing.

24:09.447 --> 24:11.491
So that's three
consecutive guys

24:11.575 --> 24:15.453
that left cartoon vapour trails
trying to get away from me.

24:15.871 --> 24:19.624
Well, you did basically call them
all pointless dick bags, so I mean...

24:19.708 --> 24:21.793
If I have to listen to one
more millennial talk

24:21.877 --> 24:24.045
about the 19 things that
he's barely doing, I'm gonna...

24:25.672 --> 24:27.883
Okay, you know, they're just...

24:28.675 --> 24:30.802
They're rifling through
things that they're into,

24:30.886 --> 24:32.971
hoping that maybe something
interests you, too.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.391
And they expect you
to dive in whenever, you know,

24:36.516 --> 24:38.101
not wait for an invitation.

24:38.768 --> 24:41.104
Dudes, they get...
they get crazy anxious

24:41.188 --> 24:43.356
when they're sitting across
from a beautiful woman.

24:44.691 --> 24:45.942
Are you anxious right now?

24:46.067 --> 24:48.028
-I'm always anxious around you.

24:51.823 --> 24:55.327
I don't know. Maybe Andy was right,
what he said to me when we broke up.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.829
Why, what'd he say?

24:57.954 --> 25:01.124
"It's not me, it's you."

25:03.460 --> 25:04.711
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.964
-That had to leave a mark.
-Yeah.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.424
Things were...

25:09.507 --> 25:12.093
they were really shitty
the last couple of weeks.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.137
Huh.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.060
Well, I will say this
about you, <i>Nana.</i>

25:20.143 --> 25:21.353
You are...

25:22.604 --> 25:26.900
uniquely
and completely you.

25:31.112 --> 25:34.616
How is that not just a nicer
version of what the fucker said?

25:34.741 --> 25:36.743
It's different because...

25:37.994 --> 25:39.955
because I wouldn't change a thing.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.797
-Way to kill a conversation.
-Yeah, it's a gift of mine.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.273
Hi. Hey.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.987
I'm digging the morning 'do.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.157
Pretty sure a team
of deranged psycho stylists

26:16.241 --> 26:18.910
sneaks in and fucks
with my hair every night.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.418
What's wrong?

26:27.335 --> 26:29.796
I recently got divorced.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.590
I heard.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.637
So, why do I still feel like
the luckiest guy on the planet?

26:39.222 --> 26:42.517
I could get used to being looked at
like that every morning.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.438
Okay.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.815
-Izzy.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.402
From the moment I opened
that hotel room door

26:52.485 --> 26:54.112
and saw you
for the very first time--

26:54.195 --> 26:55.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:56.239 --> 26:59.617
Are you about to propose
to me right now?

27:00.243 --> 27:01.828
What? No.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.248
I just got divorced
a few days ago.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.043
Okay.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.672
-But if I--
-Just, just don't.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.632
-Mm-hmm.

27:15.258 --> 27:18.053
Oh, maybe I'm not
the luckiest guy in the world.

27:18.845 --> 27:21.765
I'm a cautionary tale about
the dangers of polyamory.

27:21.848 --> 27:25.101
No, no, no. You <i>are</i>
the luckiest man in the world.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.480
We just need to...

27:29.022 --> 27:31.983
slow the fuck down,
just a little bit.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.485
-Alright.

27:34.736 --> 27:39.699
Just give it some air before
we start sprinting down aisles.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.576
-Popping out babies.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.287
Both of which
I am totally into.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.289
And you.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.917
-I'm very into you.
-Oh.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.669
Do you even know
how babies are made?

27:51.753 --> 27:53.213
Hm...

27:54.089 --> 27:56.883
I think I might have
missed that class.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.892
Pay very close attention.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.311
Ooh, Doctor.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.572
Well, congratulations.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.449
You're pregnant.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.703
You have got to be
fucking kidding me.
