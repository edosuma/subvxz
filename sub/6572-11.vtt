00:03.303 --> 00:05.897
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:06.072 --> 00:09.633
<i>Michael Bluth believed
heâ€™d just made a shocking discovery.</i>

00:09.743 --> 00:12.211
That might be an older sister
that we've never met.

00:12.312 --> 00:15.042
Wow. Look at the beak
on that bird.

00:15.148 --> 00:17.912
<i>Michael found the picture
in a secret room...</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:20.452
<i>while looking for incriminating
evidence against his father.</i>

00:20.553 --> 00:22.384
I have an older sister?

00:22.489 --> 00:25.253
<i>- Don't you kind of remember having
an older sister?</i> - Not at all.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.293
- What, do you?
- A little bit. I mean, "Nellie" does sound familiar.

00:28.395 --> 00:31.523
- Mom and Dad clearly were trying to keep this
hidden from us. - But this could be anybody.

00:31.631 --> 00:33.531
This could be a deformed neighbor or...

00:33.633 --> 00:36.864
A child that Mom and Dad
gave up for some reason...

00:36.970 --> 00:39.734
and whose identity they're now using
to pin their crimes on.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.933
The prosecutor said that there was that account
with money in it labeled "N. Bluth."

00:43.043 --> 00:44.874
Her name is Nellie.

00:44.978 --> 00:48.778
Do you remember when you thought
there was a mysterious Mr. "F" out to get you?

00:48.882 --> 00:52.283
Yeah, but that was retard... misguided.

00:52.385 --> 00:56.253
This is different. This is N. Bluth.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.416
Well, why don't you just go to Dad
and ask who Nellie is, point blank?

00:59.526 --> 01:01.426
So he can just cover it up and lie?

01:01.528 --> 01:03.962
I can't stand to hear one more lie
out of this family.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.965
Ah, there's the woman
I'm sexually attracted to.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.967
Okay. But that's the last one.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.766
- Well, I'm off to the gym to prepare for our tryst.
- Tryst?

01:12.872 --> 01:16.171
Yes, Lindsay and I are planning a night
of heterosexual intercourse.

01:16.276 --> 01:19.177
- You can just say intercourse.
- We talked about it last night.

01:19.279 --> 01:22.009
<i>After a disappointing
attempt at lovemaking.</i>

01:22.115 --> 01:25.141
Ah, this isn't going to happen.
I just want you to be satisfied.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.344
Oh, T., you're always thinking of others.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.479
I tried that. It didn't work either.

01:29.589 --> 01:34.026
You know, maybe I would be more attracted
to you if you were in better shape.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.925
You know, if you were just
more muscular, masculine.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.362
- Does that make me shallow?
- No.

01:39.466 --> 01:41.764
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

01:41.868 --> 01:44.200
Maybe we should take a little time
to work on ourselves...

01:44.304 --> 01:47.671
and then we'll plan a special night
in seven or eight days.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.038
- Or a couple of weeks.
- Let's say three weeks.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.475
- We're gonna go for it in a month.
- At the start of next month.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.479
And we're gonna call it
a 31-day month.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.845
Even though
this particular month has 30 days.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.680
Oh, you know, I've already
prepared a list of "won'ts."

01:59.786 --> 02:02.687
Oh, you're not gonna believe this.
My list of "can'ts."

02:02.789 --> 02:05.349
Marital love can be so romantic.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.449
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What?

02:07.560 --> 02:11.553
"Marital love." You were looking right at me,
and you said "marital love." Why would I...

02:11.664 --> 02:13.996
<i>George Michael
was interested because earlier that day...</i>

02:14.100 --> 02:18.400
<i>he discovered that the recent mock wedding
he'd acted in with his cousin Maeby...</i>

02:18.505 --> 02:21.406
- We're married?
<i>- was, in fact, as real and binding...</i>

02:21.508 --> 02:25.376
<i>as the rice pudding the disoriented
patients had thrown at them.</i>

02:25.478 --> 02:28.242
- I was talking to your aunt and uncle.
- Of course.

02:28.348 --> 02:31.078
They're married too... Each other.

02:31.184 --> 02:34.813
Oh, please. Pity the fool who gives me
a bunch of jibber-jabber about romance.

02:34.921 --> 02:38.220
My religious girlfriend just dumped me,
and for a simple little misunderstanding.

02:38.324 --> 02:42.488
If someone was always asking you to embrace
the Holy Trinity, what would you think they meant?

02:42.595 --> 02:44.756
<i>Gob thought it meant a three-way.</i>

02:44.864 --> 02:48.664
What? I thought that's what
all you guys lived for.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.668
What about you? You game?

02:50.770 --> 02:53.466
- Well, maybe she just wasn't for you.
- Which one?

02:53.573 --> 02:55.598
I really wasn't paying attention.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.337
The real problem is she keeps saying
that God is gonna show me a sign.

02:59.445 --> 03:03.506
The... something of my ways.
"Wisdom"?

03:03.616 --> 03:06.244
It's probably "wisdom."
Gob, listen, can I ask you a question?

03:06.352 --> 03:09.651
- Do you remember growing up with a sister?
- Sister.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.554
Uh, no, I don't.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.025
Not really ringin' any bells.

03:15.128 --> 03:18.120
- Other than Lindsay, of course.
- Oh, Lindsay!

03:18.231 --> 03:20.392
Well, you might not be
the most reputable source on this.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.900
<i>- Upstairs...</i>
- What?

03:23.002 --> 03:25.698
<i>- George Michael was sharing his news
with his cousin.</i> - You mean we're married?

03:25.805 --> 03:29.138
- It's just a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything.
- We should shred it.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.437
- It's creeping me out.
- Yeah, me... It's...

03:31.544 --> 03:34.809
But if we just put it over the dresser,
like we think it's a joke...

03:34.914 --> 03:37.144
- then we would always know...
- It is a joke.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.616
Unless we get it framed.

03:39.719 --> 03:43.177
<i>And Michael
went to investigate his mystery sister.</i>

03:43.289 --> 03:46.918
- Michael! What a surprise.
- Really? Were you expecting somebody else?

03:47.026 --> 03:49.824
Maybe, uh, one of
your <i>two</i> daughters?

03:49.929 --> 03:52.727
Oh, Lindsay and Tobias never visit.

03:52.832 --> 03:55.392
We're so bad!

03:55.501 --> 03:58.061
I-I actually meant Lindsay and Nellie.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.605
You call him that too?

04:00.707 --> 04:04.473
- Oh, it's so nice to be able to talk like this.
- Where's Dad?

04:04.577 --> 04:07.239
- What's all this?
- Computer stuff from the office.

04:07.347 --> 04:11.511
Pop, you're not doin' another one
of those Black Fridays? Your mass firings?

04:11.618 --> 04:14.143
<i>Before firing his employees, however...</i>

04:14.254 --> 04:17.485
<i>George Sr. had been sure
to clear the office of its valuables.</i>

04:17.589 --> 04:19.683
So, when do we get to see
our new, fancy offices?

04:19.791 --> 04:23.091
Soon as you get your new, fancy jobs.
You're all fired.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.323
<i>The employees never saw it coming...</i>

04:25.431 --> 04:30.767
<i>even though their first task was often
to unload computers from a rental truck.</i>

04:30.870 --> 04:33.839
No, it's not a Black Friday,
although I did enjoy those.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.376
No, the prosecution's gonna want
to have access to the hard drive...

04:37.477 --> 04:41.106
so I just want to make sure
everything's nice and clean for them.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.182
- What the hell is that thing?
- An electromagnet.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.114
Think of it as a giant delete key.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.186
Well, I hate to spoil your fun, Dad...

04:47.287 --> 04:50.882
but I got backups on all of that stuff,
and this is illegal.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.322
Oh! Well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold...

04:53.426 --> 04:56.122
but I am trying to protect my family.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.227
That's not a real gold necklace, is it?

05:00.333 --> 05:03.234
Well, it wasn't really
your 50th birthday.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.827
You know, Dad, you can't have
this stuff in here, all right?

05:05.938 --> 05:07.838
And we don't need more trouble.

05:07.940 --> 05:11.535
It's bad enough you got Buster faking a coma
just so he doesn't have to testify.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.908
I've been trying to get him
out of that coma.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.709
It's costing us a fortune.
He's sleeping us dry.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.809
Okay, faker, I'm cutting the cord.

05:20.920 --> 05:25.084
I'll see ya at the snack machine.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.853
If he knows that you don't want him
in the coma, then why's he still in it?

05:27.960 --> 05:30.360
For some reason, he won't tell me.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.728
<i>- He'd fallen for his day nurse.</i>
- Buster, you're so dear.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.667
<i>She'd found his complete lack of
personality and movement enchanting.</i>

05:37.770 --> 05:41.103
I wish you could say something.

05:41.207 --> 05:45.109
Course, if you did, everything would
be ruined 'cause you wouldn't be as pure.

05:45.211 --> 05:49.739
Speaking of living a lie, I don't suppose either
of you have remembered who this N. Bluth is.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.374
Not a Nick or a Nellie?

05:52.485 --> 05:56.012
Just the one who married Lindsay.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.420
Oh, isn't it fun to talk like this?

06:01.027 --> 06:04.360
<i>So Michael returned to the office,
where the atmosphere was paranoid.</i>

06:04.464 --> 06:07.065
- Is it Black Friday?
- No one's getting fired. No one's getting fired.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.067
But we haven't been paid,
and they took our computers.

06:09.168 --> 06:13.264
This looks bad, but it's just my father trying
to erase the hard drives to avoid conviction.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.841
The company is fine.
This is... This is fun though, isn't it?

06:15.942 --> 06:17.910
They brought out all the old machines.

06:18.010 --> 06:21.446
They've seen better days,
but I'm sure they're all functional, right?

06:21.547 --> 06:24.209
- Like Tom here.
- I'm 30.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.376
You're kidding me.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.751
<i>But Michael found
the equipment frustrating as well.</i>

06:29.856 --> 06:34.054
"Gob's Program"? Idiot.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.685
<i>And then he noticed something else.</i>

06:39.165 --> 06:41.497
- Nellie.
- Michael, I gotta talk to...

06:41.601 --> 06:44.331
Oh, wow. K-Y pro, huh?

06:44.437 --> 06:46.462
Hey, don't get any moisture
on these babes.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.506
Hey! Tobias.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.576
Buddy, I needed that information.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.735
This is that sister I've been lookin' for.

06:52.845 --> 06:56.178
Just hit "print screen." I'm sure
that whatever's on there will come up.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.682
Oh, look at that.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.584
I kind of remember these
being faster, you know?

07:02.688 --> 07:06.749
Well, we were probably all so jacked up
on amyl and disco music we didn't notice.

07:06.859 --> 07:08.759
But I'm glad about this printer lag...

07:08.861 --> 07:11.955
because I was hoping
to have a jaw session with you.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.532
Why don't we just say
as long as that means a talk?

07:14.634 --> 07:19.128
I find myself attracted
to someone who's not my wife.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.605
- What's her name?
- Michael.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.871
- Can you believe it?
- You're married to my sister.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.878
Don't you think I know that?

07:27.980 --> 07:30.778
- I-I'm not interested in you that way.
- What way?

07:30.883 --> 07:32.817
- Pick one.
- No.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.888
Did you think you were the Michael
I was talking about? No.

07:35.988 --> 07:39.219
- What? - No, interesting that
your mind went there though.

07:39.325 --> 07:44.285
Okay. Uh, no. I'm afraid the Michael
I'm talking about is all lady.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.127
- She's the trainer at my gym.
- The trainer you started with today?

07:47.233 --> 07:50.566
- Indeed. Can you believe she's a bodybuilder?
- Indeed.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.002
What am I doing?
What am I doing? What am I doing?

07:53.105 --> 07:56.006
- What am I doing? - You're nervous about
becoming intimate with Lindsay again.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.508
- I guess.
- You probably should not rush into things.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.580
Don't call this girl-Michael.
Stay away from the gym.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.377
- Just leave it alone.
- Wise words, boy-Michael.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.647
I'll tell you, if I wasn't so dripping
and disgustingly sweaty right now...

08:07.753 --> 08:10.916
I'd hop over this desk
and give you such a hug.

08:11.023 --> 08:13.548
- Hey, coulda, shoulda, woulda.
- Hey, hey. No, no.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.628
Ooh, look. Number's up.
Look at that.

08:16.729 --> 08:18.924
Ah, it would've been a seven.

08:19.031 --> 08:22.159
<i>Later that night,
Lucille visited Buster in the hospital.</i>

08:22.268 --> 08:26.227
- What the hell is this?
- My name is Representative John Van Heusen.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.604
I am here to protect
the dignity of this boy's life.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.768
Dignity? Easy for you to say.

08:31.878 --> 08:34.005
I'm the one who has to
loofah his stump.

08:34.113 --> 08:37.378
I believe death is wrong in all of its forms,
except lethal injection.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.043
But that's just as a deterrent
against more death.

08:40.152 --> 08:43.383
And this young man is enjoying life.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.753
Hey! Hey! Huh? Hey, look at us, huh?

08:45.858 --> 08:47.849
We're havin' a blast here, huh?

08:47.960 --> 08:50.451
How the hell did you even find out
about Sleeping Beauty here?

08:50.563 --> 08:53.532
It was an anonymous tip from someone
who cares about Buster's life.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.726
It's not ringing any bells.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.598
<i>In fact, it was Buster himself.</i>

08:57.703 --> 09:00.433
They're trying to kill Baby Buster.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.633
Oh, that's right... from the videos.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.870
Well, no one's killin'
Baby Buster on my watch.

09:05.978 --> 09:09.311
That is unless, of course, it's as a penalty
in a three-strikes scenario.

09:09.415 --> 09:13.408
No one's called him Baby Buster
since high school.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.646
<i>Michael, meanwhile...</i>

09:15.755 --> 09:19.213
<i>had called one number after another
until he found Frank...</i>

09:19.325 --> 09:22.294
<i>- a colleague of the woman he knew as Nellie.</i>
- I'm looking for Nellie.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.455
<i>Yeah. Well, she's workin'
a software convention at some hotel.</i>

09:25.565 --> 09:28.625
<i>- I can set up a meeting at the bar, man.</i>
- Appreciate it.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.032
<i>So Michael arrived at the bar...</i>

09:31.137 --> 09:34.937
<i>hoping to spot someone
who could be his sister.</i>

09:36.943 --> 09:40.242
She grew into the nose.
Nellie? Hey! Hi.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.246
Michael. Frank sent me.

09:42.348 --> 09:45.340
- I think I might be interested in your services.
- You won't be sorry.

09:45.451 --> 09:48.079
Yeah? I was hoping that maybe we
could just talk a little bit first, huh?

09:48.187 --> 09:51.020
- Yeah, most people want to.
<i>- They did talk.</i>

09:51.123 --> 09:55.253
<i>And Michael felt a connection
like he'd never felt with anyone in his family.</i>

09:55.361 --> 09:57.795
I had a locker on the first floor
freshman year...

09:57.897 --> 10:01.264
right next to the caf with all the junior lockers,
so it was clearly a mistake.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.632
- But I didn't say anything, right?
- Ooh, you're bad.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.932
I had that same locker
all throughout sophomore year.

10:07.039 --> 10:10.270
- Junior year they had me on the third
floor with all the frosh. - That is wild.

10:10.376 --> 10:13.368
I had the same combo throughout 'cause I
transferred the lock. Let me tell you why.

10:13.479 --> 10:16.676
<i>Hey, let's see what
some of the other folks are up to.</i>

10:18.084 --> 10:20.052
<i>Nothing there.</i>

10:21.420 --> 10:23.320
<i>Or there.</i>

10:23.422 --> 10:26.789
<i>Oh, my.</i>

10:26.892 --> 10:29.292
<i>Let's get back to Michael.</i>

10:29.395 --> 10:32.125
It was Joe Namath's number,
Babe Ruth's number, then my birthday.

10:32.231 --> 10:34.461
That is a great story.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.626
<i>It wasn't a great story.</i>

10:36.736 --> 10:40.069
<i>Nellie was just a great listener.
Most prostitutes are.</i>

10:40.172 --> 10:42.003
Nellie, the hell with formalities.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.474
- I think you and I should do business together.
- Me too.

10:51.784 --> 10:56.414
<i>Michael had just hired a woman
he'd secretly believed to be his sister.</i>

10:56.522 --> 10:58.649
How did you get into this line of work?

10:58.758 --> 11:01.989
<i>But, of course, he'd also yet
to figure out she was a prostitute.</i>

11:02.094 --> 11:05.655
I was buried in loan debt from business school,
so I started whoring myself out.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.665
<i>Not that there weren't clues.</i>

11:07.767 --> 11:11.066
What do you say we go up to my room
and seal the deal?

11:11.170 --> 11:14.003
You're stayin' here, huh? I was actually
hoping to get into your business tomorrow.

11:14.106 --> 11:16.836
It would give you a chance
to meet everybody in the office.

11:16.942 --> 11:19.035
'Cause you're gonna be working
for the whole staff.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.942
- You're gonna be filling three openings.
- Oh!

11:21.047 --> 11:24.505
I heard there were a couple of girls like me
consulting over at Enron.

11:24.617 --> 11:28.348
<i>So the next day, Michael
introduced his new consultant to his staff...</i>

11:28.454 --> 11:30.354
<i>who weren't that pleased to meet her.</i>

11:30.456 --> 11:33.857
You hired someone else?
We haven't even been paid yet.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.359
That's exactly why I hired her...
to help out with the finances.

11:36.462 --> 11:40.023
She's absolutely amazing at that stuff.
Right? You do do finances and stuff, right?

11:40.132 --> 11:43.590
- I do all sorts of scenes.
- There you go. Okay, guys.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.069
Don't be afraid to put her
in any position that you want, okay?

11:46.172 --> 11:49.573
Dave, you give her access
to everything, okay?

11:49.675 --> 11:52.473
I want you guys to think
of her as Nellie Bluth, all right?

11:52.578 --> 11:55.877
In fact, we should probably get an I.D.
With that printed on it, okay?

11:55.981 --> 11:58.415
<i>But she did have a list of "won'ts."</i>

11:58.517 --> 12:02.044
We're gonna have some ground rules
first, okay? No !@%$#

12:02.154 --> 12:04.384
!@%$ing or !@%ting.

12:04.490 --> 12:07.982
<i>And no !@%$#% unless
you're wearing a !@%$#.</i>

12:08.094 --> 12:10.062
Or you !@%$#% before you !@%$ me.

12:10.162 --> 12:14.496
And if this winds up on the Web,
I will !@%$ you in the !@%.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.398
Our computers don't even work on the Internet.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.165
Who's first?

12:20.272 --> 12:22.331
<i>Back at the model home,
George Michael was still...</i>

12:22.441 --> 12:24.409
<i>trying to make
his accidental marriage work.</i>

12:24.510 --> 12:28.469
I thought maybe tonight we could pop in
an !@%$#%@! in the old DVD player...

12:28.581 --> 12:31.243
and sit and watch it,
maybe just the two of us, husband and wife?

12:31.350 --> 12:34.911
I'm just kidding.
I mean, the State of California isn't, but...

12:35.020 --> 12:36.920
You know, that's what makes it funny.

12:37.022 --> 12:39.490
- I'm worried you're taking this too seriously.
- Are...

12:39.592 --> 12:41.651
Just the opposite.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.694
What the hell is that?

12:47.800 --> 12:50.268
I bought you a wedding ring... tone.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.770
Opposite of serious.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.967
<i>And Michael was getting an update
on how his newest employee, Nellie...</i>

12:57.076 --> 12:58.976
<i>was working out.</i>

12:59.078 --> 13:01.911
Really? And all the guys like her, huh?
That is... That is great.

13:02.014 --> 13:03.948
Uh, you mean "away" though, right?

13:04.049 --> 13:06.609
Because otherwise
it sounds a little different.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.187
But, uh, that's, uh...
that's outstanding.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.620
Real good.
You forgot to say "away" again.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.659
But, uh, listen, let me call you back
in a bit, okay? Bye.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.457
Nellie has blown them all away.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.464
Yeah, well, I think it's crazy.

13:20.566 --> 13:23.899
You've given her access to everything...
the banking... and for what?

13:24.003 --> 13:27.632
You're basing this on the fact she shares a name
with someone you played with as a baby.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.640
Lindsay, I can tell that it's real.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.210
It's like that feeling that
you read about twins having.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.711
We're twins. You didn't give me
access to the banking.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.341
No, you just... you'd go out and you'd
just whore it up, Lindsay, you know?

13:38.450 --> 13:40.577
She's different.
She's a little bit more like me.

13:40.686 --> 13:43.621
- It's like we finish each other's...
- Sandwiches?

13:43.722 --> 13:45.622
Sentences.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.692
- Why would I say...
- Sandwiches?

13:47.793 --> 13:50.660
That time I was gonna say sandwiches.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.493
- So I guess you haven't told Nellie
what you're thinking. - No, I have not.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.499
I've been waiting for the right time.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.900
I want to make sure she trusts me, especially
since Dad is probably setting her up.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.872
But I might want to hurry with that operation
because she's charging us a fortune...

14:02.975 --> 14:05.773
and she's got this old boss
that's claiming he wants a percentage.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.039
<i>Yo, man, you owe me money. I ain't no dummy.</i>

14:08.147 --> 14:12.584
<i>And it better be soon, or you're gonna
feel my hand up your !@%$#.</i>

14:12.685 --> 14:15.313
So Nellie wants to meet me tonight
for drinks. Maybe I'll tell her then.

14:15.421 --> 14:18.686
That's funny. I'm going out tonight
for drinks too... with an exciting new man.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.123
Really trying to make
that marriage work, aren't you?

14:21.227 --> 14:24.424
Well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold,
but I'm feeling a little pressure here.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.931
If you had to have sex with Tobias in four months,
you'd be shopping for a way out too.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.196
I stand corrected and disgusted.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.533
<i>And Michael arrived
for his meeting with Nellie.</i>

14:33.639 --> 14:35.539
- Are you Michael?
- Yes.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.542
- There's a nellie at the end of the bar
wants to see you. - Great. Thank you.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.373
- Oh, it's Tobias.
- Michael.

14:40.479 --> 14:45.542
Look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered?
Yes. Interested? Not tonight.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.551
I-I think I-I see what's happening.

14:47.653 --> 14:50.417
- You're meeting girl-Michael at the bar?
- It was her idea.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.888
She wanted to get a drink,
and I know it's crazy.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.586
I mean, I'm married.
And the carbs.

14:55.694 --> 14:58.822
Well, Tobias, sometimes life
is about making difficult...

14:58.931 --> 15:00.899
Sandwiches. I know.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.161
- You read my mind.
- Oh, God. Here she is.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.472
- Next to that guy?
- Uh, what guy?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.474
That guy.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.773
- No, that's her.
- Him?

15:13.879 --> 15:15.779
That's a girl.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.247
I-I think the name Michael
is making you look for a man.

15:18.350 --> 15:21.376
- Think I'm lookin' at a man.
- Michael.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.079
- Yes?
- Yes.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.315
- No, I meant girl-Michael.
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.359
So nice to meet you, girl-Michael.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.792
What? Yes? Hi, Nellie.

15:30.896 --> 15:33.421
I was thinking that
we could meet down here.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.864
Uh, actually,
I think I'm gonna come up.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.198
I really need to see you.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.534
I really want to see you too.
There's something we need to talk about.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.938
- I've always been mildly attracted to you.
- What?

15:44.043 --> 15:46.273
Let's face it. There's no denying
that there's a heat between us.

15:46.378 --> 15:50.280
- I'd like to deny that.
- I know you feel it too... this burning desire.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.909
I-I-I don't feel anything.
I-I feel a burning mutual respect.

15:54.019 --> 15:56.988
I've got an outfit that's gonna turn
that respect into something fun.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.114
Respect is fun, Nellie.

15:59.224 --> 16:02.557
You're gonna want the respect when
you hear where I... Where is the light?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.561
<i>- Don't touch that light!</i>
- What?

16:04.663 --> 16:08.463
<i>This is what happens when you steal
from Frank's stable without payin'.</i>

16:08.567 --> 16:10.967
You want to be her pimp,
you gotta settle up with me.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.402
- Pimp? You mean that she's a...
<i>- Lady of the evening.</i>

16:13.505 --> 16:17.271
<i>Working girl.
She turns illusions for money.</i>

16:17.376 --> 16:20.140
<i>And that's when
Michael recognized the voice.</i>

16:20.245 --> 16:22.145
- Tricks.
- Wait a minute.

16:22.247 --> 16:24.875
Don't you do it! Ain't nobody gonna
see what Frank look like!

16:24.984 --> 16:28.215
Franklin is Frank?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.357
<i>Michael had
just discovered that his brother...</i>

16:34.460 --> 16:37.361
<i>was the pimp for the woman
he thought was his sister.</i>

16:37.463 --> 16:39.931
What the hell is going on?
Nellie is not a prostitute.

16:40.032 --> 16:43.593
Of course she is. Oh, but I can see
what the misunderstanding is.

16:43.702 --> 16:46.830
You didn't know. Maybe we can
give him a family discount!

16:46.939 --> 16:49.237
Family discount is right. This is
the sister that I've been talking about.

16:49.341 --> 16:53.004
Maybe I should've been getting
a family rate. Oh, my God!

16:53.112 --> 16:55.546
- How do you know her?
- Met up with her after a show.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.842
- And you did things with her?
<i>- He didn't.</i>

16:57.950 --> 17:02.353
- I did. <i>- Well, if you consider
crying like a girl doing something.</i>

17:02.454 --> 17:06.584
I just want my brother to respect me,
you know. I don't even have a job.

17:06.692 --> 17:11.356
Look, I could use a man's voice on the phone,
and I like your little puppet show.

17:11.463 --> 17:14.125
Ain't so little when I take my pants off, lady.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.531
I mean, obviously I'd take
some of the cry out of that.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.729
But I am not a pimp, Michael.

17:19.838 --> 17:23.865
She needed protection,
so I make some threats, I wear this hat...

17:23.976 --> 17:26.103
and I collect my 10%.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.874
Yeah, that's a pimp,
and our sister is a prostitute.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.041
- I'm your sister?
- I think so.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.051
I found you in my dad's computer.

17:34.153 --> 17:37.179
I thought that maybe he was embezzling
money and taking advantage of you.

17:37.289 --> 17:40.383
- And that's why I hired you to do
your work at the office. - Oh, my God.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.722
Wait a minute.
What... What kind of work did you do?

17:42.828 --> 17:45.058
No wonder they were so happy.

17:45.164 --> 17:48.725
- I'm so embarrassed!
- Nellie, hang on a second.

17:48.834 --> 17:53.635
You know, Gob, this might be that sign
from God that you should change your ways.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.674
No, I think that's gonna be something big.

17:56.775 --> 18:00.438
<i>Downstairs, meanwhile,
Lindsay arrived at the bar for her date.</i>

18:00.546 --> 18:03.572
- Michael. Oh, my God! My husband!
- Oh, my God! My wife!

18:03.682 --> 18:06.308
- Are you two here for each other?
- Is that what you're doing?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.852
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

18:08.954 --> 18:11.252
- And with another man!
- And with another woman!

18:11.356 --> 18:13.324
Wait, wait.
You didn't plan this together?

18:13.425 --> 18:16.952
- I just assumed you wanted a Holy Trinity.
- Absolutely not!

18:17.062 --> 18:18.962
We're a happily married couple.

18:19.064 --> 18:21.999
Yes, who happen to be very much
in love with each other.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.502
Well, you're still gonna
have to pay Frank.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.573
<i>- And Michael confronted his father.</i>
- I know who N. Bluth is.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.108
It is Nellie, and I found her.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.838
That's your sissy cousin Larry.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.437
Even then we knew.
That's why we called him Nellie.

18:36.548 --> 18:39.312
Do you not know that expression, Michael?
I thought we were on the same page here.

18:39.418 --> 18:41.852
It's a nice try, Pop, but in your old computer
I found a Nellie.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.218
You're tryin' to tell me that
that is not my sister?

18:44.323 --> 18:47.292
Yes. It's perfectly innocent.
She's my prostitute.

18:47.392 --> 18:50.850
I'm a red-blooded man. I have certain needs
that your mom can't satisfy.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.261
<i>But sex wasn't one of them.</i>

18:53.365 --> 18:57.267
I just want my brother
to hand me my money.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.701
But he's got that hair.

18:59.805 --> 19:03.673
Why can't I have hair and money,
and him nothing?

19:03.775 --> 19:06.335
She's not my sister. I let her into the company.

19:06.445 --> 19:10.814
- You didn't give her access to the cash, did you?
- She said she liked me.

19:10.916 --> 19:15.944
She's a prostitute. That's her job.
Oh, no. The N. Bluth account.

19:16.054 --> 19:18.716
What? The N. Bluth account?
That is your account?

19:18.824 --> 19:23.022
Maybe. But it's only embezzlement
if you spend it outside the company.

19:23.128 --> 19:25.824
It's gone. It's empty.

19:25.931 --> 19:28.161
- She got to it.
- There goes the company.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.167
Okay. Now, hold on now.

19:30.269 --> 19:33.727
Let's not panic because
I-I know someone who can find her.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.932
- His name is Frank.
- That's Gob's puppet.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.836
I'm going to prison.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.106
You haven't heard from Oscar
lately, have you?

19:42.214 --> 19:43.681
- No.
- Okay.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.182
<i>And the next day
Michael returned to the office...</i>

19:46.285 --> 19:49.345
<i>to tell the employees
that Black Friday had indeed arrived.</i>

19:49.454 --> 19:51.354
Hey, Ted. What's goin' on?

19:51.456 --> 19:54.254
Nellie got all of us our checks
and these great new computers.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.884
Excuse me. Nellie, you did this?

19:56.995 --> 19:59.225
I took it out of the N. Bluth account.

19:59.331 --> 20:01.697
If you spend it within the company,
it gives the prosecutors nothing.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.792
Also, it was the only way to get myself
the 10 grand that you owed me.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.371
Ten grand? What... What did you
do with these guys exactly?

20:07.472 --> 20:10.703
They mostly just cried.
You've got a real morale problem here.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.972
You cried?

20:14.079 --> 20:17.048
- Listen, I thought that you were going to...
- Steal it?

20:17.149 --> 20:19.379
- Yes.
- But I might be your sister, remember?

20:19.484 --> 20:23.079
The fact that you didn't steal it
might actually be proof that you're not.

20:23.188 --> 20:26.487
Even if we're not related,
I think I would like for you to work here.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.958
You're very, very good at it...

20:29.061 --> 20:32.326
and what you do for a job is not really
a great way to make a living, you know?

20:32.431 --> 20:34.991
- I make 300 grand a year.
- Marry me!

20:35.100 --> 20:38.069
It's weird on so many levels.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.570
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.640
<i>Gob has a religious conversion.</i>

20:42.741 --> 20:45.232
I've seen a sign,
and I want to make this work.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.609
A committed relationship
that actually means something.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.584
How about you?
You want to do just the two of us?

20:54.686 --> 20:58.315
<i>And Buster's fake coma
is put to its greatest test.</i>

21:02.194 --> 21:05.857
- Don't you die on me. Don't you die on me.
<i>- Oh, my.</i>
