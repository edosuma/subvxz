SCOFIELD: <i>Previously on</i> Prison Break:

00:02.794 --> 00:03.961
SUCRE: What are you doing?

00:04.046 --> 00:05.672
I'm trying to remember those blueprints,

00:06.089 --> 00:07.508
what we lost to the burn.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.801
Without them,
we'll never be able to navigate those pipes

00:09.885 --> 00:11.094
beneath psych ward.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.098
Then I need to know
where you got that burn. Right now.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.601
Otherwise, your ass is going to solitary.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.728
I put my blood into this...

00:19.937 --> 00:21.230
How about you elaborate on that?

00:21.313 --> 00:23.273
How about you
stop with all the questions?

00:23.357 --> 00:26.652
You are a glorified bodyguard, that's it.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.780
Okay, I got it.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.448
KELLERMAN: Put it down.
You're not a killer.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.869
Get out of the way.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.955
You know, maybe they give you
those things for a reason.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.250
Yeah. To keep me
in their invisible freaking handcuffs.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.751
Hello, roomie.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.628
You were right about my tattoo.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.088
It is a path...

00:46.171 --> 00:49.550
And I need you to remember
when you saw it, Haywire.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.051
Who are you?

00:53.720 --> 00:56.557
Scofield. Michael Scofield.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.851
Doesn't ring a bell.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.355
We met a while ago in Gen pop. Cell 40.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.984
- Gen pop?
- General population.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.820
Officer Bellick assigned you to my cell.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.157
I have a tattoo, you drew it.

01:17.077 --> 01:21.373
Haywire, do I look even
vaguely familiar to you?

01:30.465 --> 01:33.218
Are you the guy who stole my toothpaste?

01:34.052 --> 01:38.015
Yes, yes. I stole your toothpaste.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.350
So you do remember.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.768
Candy man.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.062
Mr. Patoshik.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.320
- Mr. Scofield.
- No, thank you.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.197
Medication is mandatory.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.868
It's just a mild sedative
prescribed by Dr. Tancredi. Come on.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.038
Then I'll talk to her directly.
I'm feeling better.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.707
Oh, really? That's great. Now take the pill.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.834
Take them. They're good.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.003
I'm fine. Thank you.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.424
Carter, could you come here a sec?

02:13.759 --> 02:16.887
- Scofield went J-Cat?
- Sure did. I saw it coming, too.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.097
I knew he was gonna crack
first time I saw him.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.183
- So he's not coming back here?
- Doubt it.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.101
They had him in the whack shack.

02:23.185 --> 02:26.063
- What about Sucre?
- He's in ad seg. Why?

- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Maybe.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.407
We promise to keep it a single
for a couple of months, auction it off.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.826
Make it happen.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.084
I don't need medication.

All gone?

03:01.723 --> 03:02.808
Nice.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.453
You were right, Haywire.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.497
I did steal your toothpaste,

03:25.580 --> 03:29.209
and you drew that tattoo from memory,
and I need you to do it again.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.314
- We got a deal?
- Deal.

03:51.732 --> 03:55.360
Now get your ass out of here
and I'll put in the transfer.

Hey, man,

03:59.030 --> 04:00.866
the toilet's leaking.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.661
Look, it's dripping.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.039
I'll put in a work order.
It'll be replaced in 24 hours.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.791
You got it, boss.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.132
- I heard you was moving some real estate.
- Already been moved.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.135
- Ain't that Scofield's cell?
- Not anymore.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.017
My wife gave me this when she was born.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.983
Outliving your wife is bad enough.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.403
Outliving your daughter...

05:21.154 --> 05:23.573
No man should have to endure that.

How long does she have?

05:28.995 --> 05:32.415
Hospital says a week, maybe two.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.337
We got us a problem.

Mojo's moving into Scofield's cell,
and that ain't all.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.554
He's bitching about the toilet,
so Geary's putting in a work order.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.889
- They move that toilet...
- They find the hole.

<i>Oh, Gamer, now you see,
you had me scared there for a second.</i>

06:01.570 --> 06:04.823
- I hear you got a cell.
- Not anymore.

06:04.906 --> 06:08.118
And if you were smart,
you'd keep quiet about that.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.621
- Hey, look, I'll double what you're getting.
- I'm getting $250.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.623

- It's a surprise.

- I never said you did.

- Oh, yeah. Right there.

- It's right there in the back.

- Why are you doing this?
- I am helping you.

You hate them, remember?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.510
You got a phone call.

- Who is it?
- Your son. It's an emergency.

- Exactly.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.424

08:30.010 --> 08:32.386

08:32.470 --> 08:34.889
But where his head's at right now,
he won't listen to me.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.640
He'll listen to me. I need to see him.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.101

Open on 40!

16:53.262 --> 16:54.889
(DOOR BUZZING)

16:55.598 --> 16:57.141
Make it quick.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.785
Hey, Bob Vila, it's a cell.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.079
Quit kicking the tires and make a decision.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.332
I'll give you 100 bucks for it.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.252
You wasted my time.
Get the hell out of here.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.128
Sorry, boss. I thought it was a good bid.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.423
Close on 40!

17:29.715 --> 17:31.384
(DOOR BUZZING)

17:46.482 --> 17:48.150
Hello, Benjamin.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.860
Now, let me see,

17:49.944 --> 17:53.656
minted in 19 and 72.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.992
That's your buy-in.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.286
The rest is up to you.

18:00.788 --> 18:01.914
Hot damn.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.717
- Keep walking, peckervvood.
- Got the buy-in for the card game.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.510
Go get our money, boy.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.431
Unfortunately, you and I are gonna
have to be partners in this endeavor.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.018
Oh, hell, no.
I don't play cards, I'm a dice man.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.477
Look, all you need to know is this,

18:23.561 --> 18:27.023
every time I deal,
you bet big and never fold.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.360
See, if I'm winning every time I deal,
I end up with a Colombian necktie.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.112
You know what I'm saying?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.364
But if you're the one raking in all the cash,

18:35.448 --> 18:39.869
well, I seriously doubt anyone would
ever think you and I are working together.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.124
It's all right, baby, yeah.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.420
Excuse me.

18:49.503 --> 18:53.049
I've been all over town.
I can't find a charger for this.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.551
- Well, let me check.
- Thanks.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.608
How you doing, Savrinn?

19:10.900 --> 19:14.236
- Where's your girl?
- She's doing her job, all right?

19:14.779 --> 19:18.949
Filing a petition down at the courts.
She'll be at my place in about an hour.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.786
See, that was easy.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.915
I shouldn't have to chase you down
to get that information.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.792
Why don't you just take a step back?

19:27.875 --> 19:32.088
And why don't you remember
who you're talking to, who I work for?

19:35.424 --> 19:38.302
You need to keep
an eye on Veronica Donovan.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.013
Not some of the time, all of the time.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.766
'Cause pretty soon,
we're gonna call in our favor,

19:43.849 --> 19:46.560
unless you want to go back on our deal.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.939
- No.
- Good.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.193
Be in touch.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.870
Haywire.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.752
Haywire, did you take your meds?

20:13.170 --> 20:16.590
Well, come on.
You got something in your teeth again.

20:22.096 --> 20:26.559
You should be careful when you tell people
to remember things, Michael.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.311
Because I remember everything now.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.022
I remember how you set me up!

20:32.982 --> 20:35.526
How you smashed your own head

20:36.277 --> 20:38.738
and had me sent back here.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.284
I also remember this.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.789
The pathway.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.000
Your map.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.461
Your escape.

20:53.544 --> 20:54.712
Give me that.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.089
Don't. Don't.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.218
Now, do I tear this up

21:02.636 --> 21:06.599
or do you tell me exactly where
and when you're doing this?

21:17.568 --> 21:20.029
- It starts in the basement.
- Okay.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.533
This line leads
from the hatch in the coal room,

21:24.617 --> 21:28.370
to this pipe system here,
and that runs to the infirmary.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.498
That's how we'll get out.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.875
I just need to get out of psych ward
to set things up.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.879
But three days after I'm gone,
I'll come back up through the basement

21:36.962 --> 21:38.380
and get you out.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.049
You're just telling me what I want to hear.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.550
No, I'm not.

21:41.759 --> 21:44.553
I need you to let me get us out of here.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.598
I need you to trust me.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.696
If you try to screw me over again
I'll kill you.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.583
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.586
- How did it go?
- Filing the petition was easy,

22:17.670 --> 22:20.673
getting it approved,
that's a whole 'nother story.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.844
- You found the charger?
- Oh, yeah.

22:29.265 --> 22:33.602
- Why didn't you plug it in?
- I was just... Just thinking for a minute.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.063
- About what?
- Nothing.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.444
We're in business.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.779
What is it?

22:43.863 --> 22:47.199
His entire phone book is still in here,
322 numbers.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.153
No open seats. Gotta wait.

23:24.486 --> 23:29.450
- C-Note, crap or get off the pot.
- I'm thinking.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.536
We ain't betting on CPT here, man.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.913
Either you gonna see his bet

23:33.996 --> 23:36.081
or you can go outside
and Million Con March

23:36.165 --> 23:37.708
or whatever your people do.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.169
Either way, get on with it, son.

23:43.672 --> 23:44.882
I'm in.

23:48.177 --> 23:51.013
Three bitches, bitches.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.682
What you holding?

23:58.312 --> 23:59.730
You tell me.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.776
- Full house.
- A full house?

24:03.859 --> 24:08.030
That's a concept a Mexican should be
quite familiar with, eh, Jesus?

24:08.781 --> 24:10.449
(CHUCKUNG)

24:13.577 --> 24:14.745
She said what?

24:14.828 --> 24:18.540
She said, in unequivocal terms,
that I was not to move on Burrows.

24:18.624 --> 24:22.711
Whatever their agenda is with Burrows,
it is not the same as ours.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.505
This whole business with his father,

24:24.588 --> 24:27.841
it interferes with the one thing
that we set out to do in the first place.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.135
Put Lincoln Burrows in the ground.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.887
If he lives,

24:32.221 --> 24:34.765
you're the one that stands to lose,
not the Company.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.600
They get themselves another candidate,

24:36.684 --> 24:38.936
and you're the one
that suffers the brunt of it.

24:39.019 --> 24:42.064
Then maybe it's time we broke ranks.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.401
We do that,
they pull support for the campaign.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.653
You know that, don't you?

24:47.736 --> 24:51.073
That is, if they know, Paul.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.162
(SNIFFING) Smell that kitty.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.166
Jacks or better, Trips to win.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.007
Last hand.

25:08.382 --> 25:11.093
I'm tired of losing all my money today.

25:12.011 --> 25:16.348
- How much you up?
- I don't know. $300.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.934
- Does it hurt?
- What?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.728
The horseshoe up your ass.

25:20.811 --> 25:23.439
Rather be lucky than good, ping-pong.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.281
Misdeal. Bury the card.

25:33.115 --> 25:37.202
- Man, I don't care if you all saw my card.
- Yeah, I bet you don't.

25:37.578 --> 25:40.873
- Bury the card, young blood.
- Hey, chill, wrinkles.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.500
Ain't my fault saltine here
got a sloppy deal.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.294
That there was just uncalled for.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.129
Now, all right. You know what?
I'll tell you what.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.632
I'm gonna deal another hand,
you gonna be such a baby about it.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.930
On a misdeal, you bury the card,
finish out the hand.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.475
House rules.

26:34.343 --> 26:37.387
- Warden.
- I have some good news for you, Linc.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.974
Somehow, your lawyer's
petition went through.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.394
The Department of Corrections
is allowing you a one-hour visit

26:44.478 --> 26:46.021
with your son.

26:48.107 --> 26:51.360
I've never seen
one of these granted before, ever.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.405
- Good lawyers.
- No lawyer's that good.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.908
I'll make the travel arrangements,

26:57.991 --> 26:59.660
but this is not going to be
a ride in the country.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.121
You're gonna be y-cuffed,
and the men are gonna be heavily armed.

27:02.204 --> 27:06.542
- I don't want any problems.
- There won't be, I just want to see my son.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.978
I'll bet all I got.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.400
$82.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.113
You better have some aces
shoved up there with that horseshoe,

27:36.196 --> 27:37.948
or that pot's mine.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.287
You in or out?

28:11.940 --> 28:13.150
I'm in.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.447
And I raise you $74.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.411
- I said I only got $82 left.
- Well, then I guess you're out of luck.

28:24.494 --> 28:28.624
- You never heard of a gentleman's game?
- Yes, I have, but this ain't it.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.752
You want to borrow some money?
Ask your boys.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.838
But I'm in here to make money, bro.

28:34.922 --> 28:38.091
You want welfare,
you'd better vote Democrat.

28:53.148 --> 28:57.444
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stay away from me in the yard.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.033
(SIGHING)

29:12.000 --> 29:14.461
You think you're smarter than me?

29:36.900 --> 29:37.943
(ALARM BLARING)

29:38.026 --> 29:39.820
No,no,no!

29:39.903 --> 29:43.699
Okay, there's a pathway.
No, there's a pathway! There's a pathway!

29:43.782 --> 29:46.868
Look, he's trying to escape!
He's trying to escape. This is his map!

29:46.952 --> 29:49.579
- Haywire, I need you to come back!
- He set me up!

29:49.663 --> 29:51.957
- Zap him!
- No! No!

30:07.055 --> 30:08.473
There he is.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.232
Hey, boss.
I think you dropped something, man.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.819
That's half a G-note.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.946
- So when do I move in?
- You don't.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.114
What?

30:24.614 --> 30:29.411
- Oh, come on, chief, now, we had a deal.
- Renegotiation, the price is $700 now.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.165
That ain't right. I just gave you $500.

30:33.248 --> 30:37.586
What you gave me was a down payment.
If you can't come up with the rest, well...

30:37.669 --> 30:40.130
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.090
One minute, all right?

30:45.635 --> 30:48.096
Oh, man, he's trying to shake us down.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.640
- I'm gonna need that watch.
- Not an option.

30:50.724 --> 30:54.519
Look, would you rather be
looking at a picture of your daughter

30:54.603 --> 30:57.773
or holding her in your arms
once you get outside?

31:19.628 --> 31:22.714
Hey, look, man,
Father Time owed me a few bones.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.716
He gave me this in trade.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.469
That should be
more than enough to cover it.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.804
Not bad.

31:29.179 --> 31:32.057
Your problem is somebody
already gave me $700 for the cell,

31:32.140 --> 31:33.934
so, you're S.O.L.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.561
No! No! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:36.645 --> 31:38.480
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Look.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.190
So you're just gonna
take my money and walk?

31:40.273 --> 31:42.901
Yeah, well, write to your congressman.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.741
Oh, come on!

31:59.292 --> 32:00.502
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

32:02.170 --> 32:03.755
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:03.839 --> 32:07.259
- They said you wanted to talk to me.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:07.843 --> 32:08.969
Okay.

32:09.678 --> 32:10.846
Good.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.517
Please.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.645
Thanks.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.858
I made you something.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.032
It's an ashtray.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.201
- I don't smoke.
- Yeah, I know.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.663
But they only
let us make these and jewelry,

32:37.080 --> 32:39.291
and I didn't figure you
for the macaroni necklace type.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.043
It's very sweet.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.755
How about we talk
about how you're doing?

32:48.049 --> 32:50.886
I think we both know I don't belong here.

32:50.969 --> 32:55.223
I don't remember much about that night,
but being locked up in ad seg,

32:55.307 --> 32:57.350
something must've snapped.

32:59.478 --> 33:03.732
What I'm trying to say is,
I think I've had enough of arts and crafts.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.151
But that's your call.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.904
And the doctors here
do say that you've been acting fine.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.406
The problem is that
if you don't tell the Pope who burned you,

33:11.490 --> 33:13.742
he's gonna lock you back up in ad seg.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.829
And after a couple days of that,
you're gonna be right back here.

33:21.625 --> 33:25.670
Michael, I hate what happened to you,
and I hate that you're here.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.256
But you have got to let me help you.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.386
If you want to get out of psych ward,
and stay out,

33:33.470 --> 33:36.932
you've got to tell the Pope
the truth about that burn.

33:39.476 --> 33:42.229
Out with the old, in with the new, cons.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.491
I got a message from your cellie, bro.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.702
He says he's okay
and he's trying to fill in the blanks.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.997
Did he say he's trying,
or that he already got the blanks filled in?

34:01.081 --> 34:03.291
Yo, man, I don't know.
I didn't write it down.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.419
Okay. Now you gotta tell him
that I filled in the hole.

34:06.503 --> 34:10.172
Yeah, yeah, I'm done
with your little secrets and messages, bro.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.092
I saw Scofield's back.

34:12.175 --> 34:15.554
He's got a burn in the same spot
as the burn in that guard's shirt.

34:15.637 --> 34:19.099
I don't know what you're doing
but I have an idea, huh?

34:19.474 --> 34:23.270
And I'm through helping you
until you tell me what's going on.

34:23.353 --> 34:24.853
I can't, bro.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.315
- Then good luck in the hole, <i>jefe.</i>
- No, no, no! Wait, wait.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.609
LINCOLN: Manche.

34:30.318 --> 34:33.405
- Who's that?
- That's Linc, bro.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.364
- Linc the Sink?
- Yeah.

34:35.447 --> 34:36.783
Come here.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.714
I think we can work something out.

34:51.422 --> 34:56.177
All I can say is, before I get out of here,
Geary will pay. Believe that.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.971
No one's getting out of here

34:58.054 --> 35:01.349
if maintenance goes to
replacing Scofield's toilet.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.185
I got a way to help you
with your Scofield problem.

35:04.269 --> 35:08.148
- What'd you say, slim?
- I said I got a way to help you with...

35:08.815 --> 35:12.611
- Who the hell said we had a problem?
- It's cool, man. Relax.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.821
Lincoln and Sucre told me everything.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.033
What in the hell did they tell you?
Exactly, what did they tell you?

35:18.116 --> 35:22.621
Everything. They said I can come with you,
you know, on early parole,

35:22.704 --> 35:25.498
if I can help get the Fish out of psych.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.919
What are we, the A train?
Everyone gets to ride with us?

35:31.379 --> 35:34.758
Why don't you take a walk,
before I give you a smack?

35:36.843 --> 35:39.721
You got another solution to our situation?

35:42.474 --> 35:44.184
I didn't think so.

35:47.896 --> 35:51.691
Me and my cuz and Lincoln

35:52.233 --> 35:53.985
came up with something.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.738
Now, it can work, but it's risky.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.424
You ready to get out of
this aquarium, Fish?

37:20.864 --> 37:22.490
Assure me I'll be protected.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.616
(DOOR BUZZING)

37:23.700 --> 37:25.410
Michael, you know me
well enough by now.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.912
Such assurances are not necessary.

37:28.163 --> 37:31.332
With all due respect, Warden,
if I had been protected in the first place,

37:31.416 --> 37:33.793
none of this would have happened.

37:42.469 --> 37:46.014
- A name.
- Geary.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.308
Geary?

37:48.391 --> 37:52.395
He shakes cons down for money,
anything he can get his hands on.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.356
He knew I went to college, so he must've...

37:55.440 --> 37:57.650
He must've thought
I was rich or something.

37:57.734 --> 38:00.987
Anyway, when I couldn't pay up,

38:01.070 --> 38:05.492
he held me down with one arm,
and burned me with the other.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.206
I don't know what he used,

38:12.665 --> 38:14.584
but it was hot as hell.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.425
What a surprise. Disconnected.

38:22.634 --> 38:27.055
Two-hundred and fifty businesses,
72 residences, covering all 50 states.

38:27.138 --> 38:31.059
- London, Martinique, Jakarta, Dakar.
- All the numbers out of service.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.393
As soon as Quinn disappeared,

38:32.477 --> 38:34.521
they must've
erased the paper trail within days.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.898
Is there anything they can't do?

38:38.817 --> 38:41.736
My P.l. buddy in DC.
What if I send him all this,

38:41.820 --> 38:44.656
see if he can make
a connection between the numbers?

38:44.739 --> 38:46.825
I'll tell him I need it ASAP.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.077
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's no big deal.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.955
I'll just overnight him all this stuff.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.416
No. For everything.

38:55.792 --> 38:58.545
For hanging in there, keeping me going.

38:58.628 --> 39:01.881
- Thank you.
- Sure.

GEARY: Guy with a six ERA,
signs for four mil a year.

39:06.803 --> 39:09.055
Sucks at his job, he still gets a raise.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.975
You suck at your job.
You should ask the Pope for a raise.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.434
Very funny.

39:19.274 --> 39:22.402
Warden, what brings you
to our little clubhouse?

39:24.904 --> 39:26.531
Hey, what gives?

39:49.470 --> 39:50.847
Hey, that was a gift from my old man.

39:50.930 --> 39:55.101
Since when is your name Charles
and your dad's name Ann?

40:30.345 --> 40:33.139
This is a railroad. I didn't do nothing!

40:33.306 --> 40:37.435
Don't look at me like I'm some con.
You're as crooked as scoliosis.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.356
I don't get caught.

41:15.181 --> 41:16.349
When we get there,

41:16.432 --> 41:19.102
I'll take you out of the y-cuffs
and put you in a four-piece.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.479
- Got it?
- Got it, boss.

41:21.938 --> 41:24.065
You play nice, I play nice.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.901
- Understand?
- Got it.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.761
She's here. I've got her.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.403
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

42:11.946 --> 42:15.366
Never thought
I'd be so glad to be back in my cell.

42:20.246 --> 42:23.791
Pope wanted me to give you this.

42:59.285 --> 43:02.789
- What the hell are you staring at, anyway?
- Everything.
