WEBVTT

00:09.868 --> 00:13.934
Wow. That was great.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.734
Good, I'm glad.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.367
Wait, wait, wait.
You're glad?

00:19.367 --> 00:21.601
Yeah.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.901
I knew it.

00:23.968 --> 00:26.000
There was no "gaa."

00:26.067 --> 00:27.067
"Gaa"?

00:27.133 --> 00:29.234
When the sex is
working for you,

00:29.300 --> 00:33.067
you try to say "God,"
but it comes out "Ga."

00:33.100 --> 00:35.534
And this time,
there was no "gaa."

00:35.601 --> 00:36.701
Charlie...

00:36.767 --> 00:40.934
No "gaa," no good.

00:41.468 --> 00:42.934
And I'll tell you
another thing.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.667
You usually grab my ass
like you're holding

00:44.734 --> 00:47.600
a tree trunk in
a hurricane.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.401
Just now, it was more
like you were palming

00:49.468 --> 00:51.934
a couple of cantaloupes
at the supermarket.

00:52.001 --> 00:53.934
Fireworks don't have
to go off every time

00:54.001 --> 00:55.201
for me to enjoy it.

00:55.202 --> 00:59.202
Oh, please, fireworks is the whole
point of the exercise.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.767
Otherwise, all you've got I.

01:00.834 --> 01:03.533
two naked people humping
on a Stair Master.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.434
Sometimes it's nice
just being close.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.767
Nice being close.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.134
Great.

01:10.201 --> 01:12.500
Now I know what it's
like to be my brother.

01:12.567 --> 01:14.667
Would you stop it?

01:15.234 --> 01:17.434
No, this is the
beginning of the end.

01:17.434 --> 01:19.400
First our sex life
goes to hell,

01:19.467 --> 01:21.734
then we start eating
dinner at 4:,

01:21.801 --> 01:25.501
<i>watching reruns of
Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman,</i>

01:25.567 --> 01:29.133
and at 9:00 we shake hands,
pee and go to sleep.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.400
Then around midnight
I get up to pee again.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.767
Quit making such
a big deal out of it.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.234
Just because every once
in a while

01:35.300 --> 01:36.567
I don't have an orgasm...

01:36.634 --> 01:38.634
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:38.701 --> 01:40.534
This has happened before?

01:40.601 --> 01:41.868
Just a few times.

01:41.934 --> 01:44.100
Why didn't I know?
Were you faking it?

01:44.167 --> 01:44.968
Does it matter?

01:45.033 --> 01:46.501
You're damn right, it matters.

01:47.067 --> 01:49.167
Why'd you stop?
Don't you love me any more?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.101
Of course I love you.

01:51.167 --> 01:53.134
If you really loved me,
you'd keep faking it.

01:53.201 --> 01:55.500
Fine, from now on
I'll fake it.

01:55.567 --> 01:58.967
Too late.
Now I'm on to you.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.633
Honey, there's nothing
to get so upset about.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.533
I've just been working really
hard, under a lot of stress.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.167
Then on top of that,
I'm trying to plan our wedding

02:08.234 --> 02:11.033
and dealing with my parents,
your mother.

02:11.067 --> 02:13.800
But trust me,
as far as I'm concerned,

02:13.867 --> 02:15.767
you're still the sexiest man
on Earth

02:15.834 --> 02:18.900
and I'm the luckiest woman
who ever lived.

02:22.134 --> 02:25.633
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.034
Ooh

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.000 --> 02:57.967
I thought
you were taking

02:58.033 --> 02:59.000
your girlfriend out for dinner.

02:59.067 --> 03:00.434
I am. But if I eat first,

03:00.501 --> 03:02.634
I won't pick out in the
restaurant and make her sick.

03:02.701 --> 03:04.334
Good idea.
That way you'll have

03:04.401 --> 03:07.000
the whole rest of the night
to make her sick.

03:07.067 --> 03:09.933
Exactly.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Plus I won't snap at her if she
reaches for one of my fries.

03:14.067 --> 03:16.734
All right, Chelsea'll be home
in a few minutes.

03:16.801 --> 03:18.033
How are we doing?

03:18.100 --> 03:19.933
The wine's denting,
pasta's on the stove,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.868
salad's in the fridge, Martin
Gaye's on the CD player.

03:22.933 --> 03:24.601
Gay.

03:27.634 --> 03:29.167
And what about this?

03:29.234 --> 03:31.467
<i>Where's this gonna be tonight</i>

03:31.534 --> 03:33.868
It has a date.

03:34.933 --> 03:36.834
Oh, eating first.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.401
I taught you well.

03:38.467 --> 03:39.567
Thank you.

03:39.634 --> 03:41.434
Clean underwear?

03:41.501 --> 03:42.734
Cleanish.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.267
Not good enough.

03:46.334 --> 03:47.834
With underwear,
there's no gray area.

03:47.835 --> 03:49.335
Don't worry, it's not gray.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.634
Anything but white
is unacceptable.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.967
In that case, I'd better change.

03:58.334 --> 04:00.100
And take off the bib!

04:01.634 --> 04:04.134
If he can score just once
before I die,

04:04.200 --> 04:05.768
my life will have been
worthwhile.

04:05.834 --> 04:08.167
Well, then you might want
to start eating healthier.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.367
What's the big
occasion tonight?

04:12.434 --> 04:13.734
There's no big occasion.

04:13.801 --> 04:16.166
Just trying to keep the
fire going with Chelsea.

04:16.233 --> 04:17.767
You know
what's good for that?

04:17.834 --> 04:19.634
Doing it in public.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.033
Really?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.134
Yeah, there's nothing
like the thrill

04:24.200 --> 04:25.467
of thinking
you might get caught.

04:25.534 --> 04:26.734
I gotta tell ya,

04:26.801 --> 04:28.933
you almost walked in on me
a couple of times.

04:31.334 --> 04:32.734
You're kidding.

04:32.801 --> 04:35.134
Just a heads-up,
the next time you see

04:35.200 --> 04:37.768
the Sparkletts' truck parked
outside, avoid the garage.

04:41.701 --> 04:44.167
From nown,
I'm gonna avoid water.

04:51.267 --> 04:55.401
Good news, Alan, you're going
to the movies tonight.

04:57.933 --> 04:58.967
Alan?

05:15.467 --> 05:16.901
What are you doing?

05:16.967 --> 05:17.834
Nothing.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.268
What is that?

05:20.334 --> 05:21.767
That's, uh,
that's hairspray.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.901
Really? Hairspray.
Let me see it.

05:23.901 --> 05:26.067
No. Leave me alone.

05:26.134 --> 05:27.867
What's the big deal?

05:27.867 --> 05:30.101
It's not a big deal.
Just go away.

05:30.167 --> 05:32.533
All right, but I need you out
the house tonight

05:32.600 --> 05:34.234
so I can be alone with Chelsea.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.600
Don't worry, I have a date.

05:35.667 --> 05:36.867
Another Internet hook up?

05:36.934 --> 05:39.400
Suave Singles.com.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.433
First month's free.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.834
That must be how they keep out
the riff-raff.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.067
Have fun.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.267
Thank you, I will.

05:48.401 --> 05:50.367
Hey! Hey!

05:50.434 --> 05:54.534
"Captain Terry's
Spray-On Hair.

05:54.601 --> 05:57.567
guaranteed to
cover bald spots."

05:57.634 --> 05:59.000
It's not really a bald spot.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.801
I'm just getting
a little thin on top.

06:00.868 --> 06:03.167
So you're painting your head?

06:03.234 --> 06:05.033
It's not paint.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.667
It's a specially formulated
hairlike substance

06:06.734 --> 06:08.868
designed for the active man
on the go.

06:09.433 --> 06:12.533
Oh, you poor, gullible bastard.

06:14.567 --> 06:16.101
It gives me confidence.

06:16.101 --> 06:17.667
Okay, fine.

06:17.734 --> 06:19.368
But what happens
to your confidence

06:19.433 --> 06:21.500
when your date runs her fingers
through your...

06:21.567 --> 06:24.301
specially formulated
hairlike substance?

06:24.368 --> 06:28.034
It's "guaranteed not to smear
drip or ignite

06:28.101 --> 06:29.433
under normal circumstances."

06:31.467 --> 06:33.800
So you're gonna spend the rest
of your life spray-painting

06:33.867 --> 06:36.234
your head like it's
a free way underpants?

06:36.301 --> 06:38.368
This is just a stopgap
till the pills kick in.

06:38.433 --> 06:41.001
What's this, like Propecia?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.467
Better, stronger.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.034
It's from Eastern Europe
where they don't have

06:44.101 --> 06:46.301
to worry about all those pesky
FDA regulations.

06:46.368 --> 06:49.034
There's a monkey on the label.

06:49.101 --> 06:53.201
It is not a monkey,
it's the inventor.

06:54.234 --> 06:57.001
How long have you been
taking these?

06:57.067 --> 06:58.001
A couple of weeks.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.533
has to build up
in your system,

06:59.600 --> 07:01.167
and then stand back
and grab a comb.

07:01.234 --> 07:04.067
Okay, well, far be it for me
to judge someone

07:04.634 --> 07:06.667
for taking questionable
pharmaceuticals,

07:06.734 --> 07:09.434
but be careful with this stuff.

07:09.501 --> 07:11.067
Charlie, do you really think
I'm so vain

07:11.134 --> 07:12.300
that I would jeopardize
my health

07:12.367 --> 07:13.567
just to grow a little hair?

07:13.634 --> 07:14.900
Do I have to remind you

07:14.967 --> 07:18.167
about the Japanese penis
enlargement system you bought?

07:18.234 --> 07:21.967
That is not what caused
the rupture.

07:27.367 --> 07:30.167
I'm sorry, but this is a monkey.

07:37.300 --> 07:42.067
So did you make your way
around the mountain?

07:42.134 --> 07:43.567
Excuse me?

07:43.634 --> 07:47.501
You know, were you driving
six white horses?

07:47.567 --> 07:49.434
What are you
talking about?

07:54.900 --> 07:57.667
Are you asking me
if I had an orgasm, Charlie?

07:57.734 --> 07:59.768
Yeah, but I'm trying
to be cute about it.

07:59.834 --> 08:01.734
No, I did not.

08:01.801 --> 08:03.000
But it doesn't matter.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.434
It was wonderful.

08:04.501 --> 08:05.701
Were you at least close?

08:05.768 --> 08:06.801
Yes, I was close.

08:06.868 --> 08:07.967
Well, that's a start.

08:08.033 --> 08:10.234
Now, when you were close,
what was I doing?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.167
You were downstairs
getting a beer.

08:16.567 --> 08:17.634
I'm kidding.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.067
Can we please
just drop it?

08:19.134 --> 08:22.467
Excuse me for trying to
bring you back to "gaa."

08:22.533 --> 08:25.533
Sex is not just about orgasms.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.767
Oh, really?

08:26.834 --> 08:29.634
Then how are we supposed
to know when we're done?

08:29.700 --> 08:30.834
Don't pout.

08:30.901 --> 08:31.967
I'm not pouting.

08:32.034 --> 08:34.067
Yes, you are. Your bottom lip
is sticking out.

08:34.134 --> 08:35.967
It's swollen.

08:36.034 --> 08:39.900
You could've stopped
at any time.

08:39.967 --> 08:42.767
No, no, I am
not a quitter.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.467
Sweetheart, do you know what
the best part of tonight was?

08:45.533 --> 08:47.467
For you or me?

08:47.533 --> 08:49.634
'Cause I think mine
was pretty obvious.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.368
It was that you cared enough

08:51.433 --> 08:53.533
to plan this amazing evening
for me.

08:53.534 --> 08:57.234
The beautiful dinner, wine on the deck,

08:57.234 --> 09:00.134
the two of us talking,
just being together.

09:00.201 --> 09:03.834
It's nights like these that make
me realize how lucky I am

09:03.901 --> 09:07.567
to have found the man I want to
spend the rest of my life with.

09:09.901 --> 09:12.567
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

09:16.834 --> 09:19.268
Oh! Oh! Oh!

09:20.567 --> 09:22.400
Hey.
Hey.

09:24.967 --> 09:26.967
Alan, I don't know
how to tell you this,

09:27.034 --> 09:30.234
but your bangs are dripping down
your face.

09:30.301 --> 09:32.301
A little lesson for you,
Charlie.

09:32.368 --> 09:34.934
There are two things you never
want to buy on the cheap:

09:35.001 --> 09:37.834
canned hair and condoms.

09:37.835 --> 09:39.835
I'm assuming it never got

09:40.334 --> 09:42.134
No, it did not.

09:42.201 --> 09:44.334
Once my hair started dripping
on her chicken masala,

09:44.400 --> 09:48.201
the evening was
pretty well shot.

09:48.268 --> 09:51.667
I probably should've sprung for
Captain Terry's Hair Sealer.

09:51.734 --> 09:54.567
Well, maybe you'll have better
luck with the monkey pills.

09:54.634 --> 09:57.201
Oh, thanks for reminding me.

09:57.268 --> 10:00.167
If the date was so bad,
why are you home so late?

10:00.234 --> 10:03.867
I've been at the emergency room
having my eyes flushed.

10:03.934 --> 10:08.034
Apparently, my hair contains
small particles of fibreglass.

10:12.967 --> 10:14.734
What the hell's he doing?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.067
Trying to sneak in
two hours after curfew.

10:17.634 --> 10:18.834
Aren't you gonna punish him?

10:18.900 --> 10:21.167
Maybe tomorrow.

10:21.234 --> 10:23.067
It's hard to assume
any kind of moral authority

10:23.134 --> 10:24.933
with Captain Terry's
specially formulated hair

10:25.000 --> 10:26.801
all over my face.

10:26.868 --> 10:31.667
True. You do kinda look like
a hot fudge sundae.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.234
Oh, hey.

10:44.300 --> 10:45.768
Didn't see you there.

10:45.834 --> 10:49.467
That's the first time
anyone ever said that to me.

10:50.801 --> 10:52.667
Taking a lunch break?

10:52.667 --> 10:55.033
Sure, let's call it that.

10:56.067 --> 10:57.967
Mind if I ask you a question?

10:58.033 --> 11:00.334
It's Liz Taylor's
White Diamonds.

11:00.401 --> 11:01.701
What?

11:01.768 --> 11:02.801
My fragrance.

11:02.868 --> 11:04.300
You can get it at Cost co.

11:04.367 --> 11:06.134
Nice.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.367
It's a great stocking
stuffer for Christmas.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.601
I'll remember.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.801
I'll act surprised.

11:15.501 --> 11:18.267
Actually, I was gonna ask you
about when you were married.

11:18.334 --> 11:19.467
Which time?

11:19.534 --> 11:20.501
What was the long one?

11:20.567 --> 11:22.167
Jerry. 14 years.

11:22.234 --> 11:23.801
God rest his soul.

11:23.868 --> 11:26.534
He's dead?
He better be.

11:28.734 --> 11:31.567
Okay, well, when
Jerry walked among us,

11:31.634 --> 11:34.268
was there a time when
he wasn't, you know,

11:34.334 --> 11:35.667
doing it for you?

11:35.734 --> 11:38.600
<i>You mean even though
he was doing it to me?</i>

11:38.667 --> 11:39.901
Yeah.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.867
Well, sure.
But that's natural.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.834
Passion always fades over time.

11:43.901 --> 11:46.334
Before you know it,
you find yourself daydreaming,

11:46.334 --> 11:49.001
barely noticing the naked guy
with the bad mullet

11:49.067 --> 11:52.234
and the flip-flops doing his
dirty business on top of you.

11:52.301 --> 11:54.500
Jerry?

11:54.567 --> 11:57.034
God, no--
I never let Jerry on top.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.767
He was like a fur-covered
water heater.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.067
So that's it?

12:03.134 --> 12:04.967
That's all I have
to look forward to?

12:05.034 --> 12:07.400
A wife that has to go
to a happy place

12:07.467 --> 12:09.101
every time I have sex with her?

12:09.167 --> 12:10.567
Is Chelsea complaining?

12:10.634 --> 12:11.600
No.

12:11.667 --> 12:12.901
Can you read her mind?

12:12.967 --> 12:13.767
No.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.167
Then don't worry about it.

12:16.234 --> 12:18.134
How can I not worry?

12:18.200 --> 12:20.300
Orgasms is one of the few things

12:20.300 --> 12:22.601
I bring to the table
in this relationship.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.033
Well, I can't are
with you there.

12:26.434 --> 12:29.000
But maybe this is
the perfect opportunity

12:29.067 --> 12:31.200
for you to become
a better boyfriend,

12:31.267 --> 12:33.900
a more compassionate,
caring individual.

12:35.134 --> 12:38.067
Or you could buy her
one of them vibrating eggs.

12:39.768 --> 12:41.167
They're awesome.

12:41.234 --> 12:43.067
I heard.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.401
I got to go.

12:50.933 --> 12:53.434
Man, I hope
I can hold on to this buzz

12:53.501 --> 12:56.434
until the Sparkletts' guy
gets here.

13:01.401 --> 13:02.967
Alan, you in here?

13:03.033 --> 13:04.300
Bathroom.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.401
Getting ready for a date.

13:05.467 --> 13:07.534
Another Suave Single?

13:07.601 --> 13:09.868
No, my free trial
expired.

13:09.933 --> 13:11.900
Now I'm on J-Date.

13:14.267 --> 13:16.267
Alan, we're not Jewish.

13:16.334 --> 13:18.067
Who cares?
You should see these girls--

13:18.134 --> 13:20.067
very hotsy-totsy.

13:20.134 --> 13:23.300
And the best part is,
till my hair pills kick in,

13:23.367 --> 13:26.234
two birds with one stone.

13:28.033 --> 13:29.501
So, how can I help you?

13:29.567 --> 13:31.167
Well... believe it or not,

13:31.234 --> 13:33.367
I wanted to ask your advice
about women.

13:33.434 --> 13:34.501
Me? I'm flattered.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.100
What do you want to know?

13:36.667 --> 13:37.901
Well.

13:37.967 --> 13:39.734
Sit, boy chick.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.734
Okay, I'm having
a little problem,

13:45.800 --> 13:48.634
you know, satisfying
Chelsea in the bedroom.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.867
Uh-huh.

13:49.934 --> 13:52.867
So I thought to myself,
who knows more

13:52.934 --> 13:55.967
about not satisfying a woman
than my brother Alan?

13:57.567 --> 14:00.901
That's a very unfair
characterization...

14:00.967 --> 14:03.934
but not entirely
inaccurate.

14:04.001 --> 14:05.834
Go on.

14:06.901 --> 14:08.800
My question is...

14:08.867 --> 14:11.034
how do you live
with yourself?

14:11.034 --> 14:12.867
How do you wake up
in the morning

14:12.934 --> 14:15.268
and not drag a straight
razor across your throat?

14:15.334 --> 14:19.567
Well, that's not an
easy question to answer.

14:19.634 --> 14:23.800
Uh, first of all, I don't
own a straight razor.

14:23.867 --> 14:25.500
This is what happened
with you and Judith, right?

14:25.567 --> 14:28.101
Actual, Judith was
always highly orgasmic.

14:28.167 --> 14:28.901
Really?

14:28.967 --> 14:31.400
Not with me, of course.

14:31.467 --> 14:33.734
But as long as I didn't let
the battery drawer get empty,

14:33.800 --> 14:35.800
she was one happy shiksa.

14:36.367 --> 14:38.200
So, how did you
deal with that?

14:38.267 --> 14:40.768
Didn't it make you feel
like less of a man?

14:40.834 --> 14:42.734
Okay, I understand.

14:42.801 --> 14:44.967
Your problem is,
your male ego

14:45.033 --> 14:47.167
is tied to your partner's
sexual pleasure.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.967
Your self-esteem is
almost entirely based

14:49.033 --> 14:51.434
<i>on whether or not she
achieves some vel</i>

14:51.501 --> 14:53.567
of physical satisfaction.
Uh-huh.

14:53.634 --> 14:55.033
You got to get past that.

14:56.234 --> 14:58.900
What, you're saying
I shouldn't care?

14:58.967 --> 15:03.801
Charlie... our people have
spent thousands of years

15:03.868 --> 15:06.300
carrying the
burden of guilt.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.900
I say enough!

15:07.967 --> 15:10.601
It's time to break
the shackles.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.501
Okay, okay, first of all,
I'm pretty sure

15:13.567 --> 15:15.534
<i>that our people
are Scotch-Irish.</i>

15:15.601 --> 15:17.734
Perhaps. But the
Talmud teaches us

15:17.801 --> 15:21.033
that the true worth of a
man is in his good works

15:21.100 --> 15:22.434
and devotion to God.

15:22.501 --> 15:24.200
The Talmud?
Yeah, I Googled it.

15:24.267 --> 15:27.200
Figured I might need a
little Jewish dinner chat.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.234
Lucky I did some research--

15:29.301 --> 15:32.500
I was planning on taking
this girl to Red Lobster.

15:32.567 --> 15:34.533
Meshuggah, right?

15:35.667 --> 15:37.533
Oh! Uh, I got to go.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.467
Oh, uh, listen, Jake's grounded for coming
in late last night,

15:40.533 --> 15:42.967
so be a mensch and keep an eye
on the little pisher, would you?

15:47.001 --> 15:50.368
Boy...

15:59.500 --> 16:01.301
This is fun, huh?

16:01.301 --> 16:03.467
I guess.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.368
Gin.

16:05.433 --> 16:06.834
Damn.

16:06.901 --> 16:07.867
Okay.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.433
Let's go again.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.567
You do realize that
at a certain point

16:11.634 --> 16:13.634
we're going to have
to go to bed.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.268
I know. know.
It's not like

16:15.334 --> 16:16.433
I'm avoiding it
or anything.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.533
Really? Because this
is the first time

16:18.600 --> 16:21.500
since I've known you you've
suggested we play a game

16:21.567 --> 16:23.301
that doesn't involve
money or nudity.

16:23.368 --> 16:25.800
We could play for
money if you want.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.834
What do you say,
penny a point?

16:27.901 --> 16:30.667
We'll go to bed when someone's up
a hundred bucks.

16:30.734 --> 16:32.400
Come on,
are we gonna talk

16:32.467 --> 16:34.767
about the elephant
in the room or not?

16:34.767 --> 16:36.268
What's there
to talk about?

16:36.334 --> 16:38.134
I can't ring your
bell any more,

16:38.201 --> 16:40.101
so we'll grow
old, I'll die,

16:40.167 --> 16:42.600
and you'll find happiness
with a vibrating egg.

16:42.667 --> 16:46.500
Did you ever stop to consider that maybe
this isn't about you?

16:47.500 --> 16:49.034
No, not really.

16:49.101 --> 16:50.667
Well, it isn't.

16:50.734 --> 16:52.800
Then what's it about?

16:52.867 --> 16:54.634
It's personal.

16:54.700 --> 16:58.167
What's more personal
than bumping pee-pees?

17:01.268 --> 17:02.867
All right, fine.

17:06.532 --> 17:08.800
My ex-husband's
getting remarried.

17:10.201 --> 17:13.300
I'm sorry, are we still
having the same conversation?

17:15.534 --> 17:18.634
I know it sounds stupid,
but ever since I found out,

17:18.701 --> 17:21.166
I somehow felt shut down.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.200
Why?

17:22.267 --> 17:23.601
I don't know,
I guess because

17:23.666 --> 17:25.000
he's moving on
with his life.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.768
Yeah, but you're
getting married, too.

17:26.834 --> 17:29.267
<i>Yeah, but I'm getting married
because I'm over him.</i>

17:29.334 --> 17:31.501
<i>He's getting married
because he's over me.</i>

17:31.567 --> 17:32.667
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

17:32.734 --> 17:34.067
Are you still
in love with him?

17:34.134 --> 17:36.200
Of course not, you idiot--
I'm in love with you.

17:36.501 --> 17:39.201
Good.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.602
I'm sorry.

17:42.934 --> 17:44.934
Okay, let me just make
I'm sure I'm following this

17:45.001 --> 17:46.567
Knowing that this guy
is getting married

17:46.600 --> 17:49.101
has somehow gotten in the
way of you having an orgasm.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.967
Maybe.

17:51.034 --> 17:52.433
I think so.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.667
Boy, women.

17:54.734 --> 17:56.500
What's that supposed to mean?

17:56.500 --> 17:57.967
Well, nothing, nothing.

17:58.034 --> 18:02.134
It's just I once had an orgasm
with a lawn dart in my foot.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.967
Do you think I'm crazy?

18:08.033 --> 18:09.100
No, no. No.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.667
Having sex right over the hedge

18:13.033 --> 18:15.134
from where the kids were
throwing lawn darts, that was crazy.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.534
And believe it or not, I understand.

18:17.601 --> 18:19.167
You do?
Well, sure.

18:19.234 --> 18:21.067
No one wants their former
lovers to be happy.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.900
They don't?
Well, hell, no.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.567
Most of my former lovers want me dead.

18:27.533 --> 18:30.667
A couple have tried.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.567
In fact, now that I know you
have a vengeful, petty side,

18:34.634 --> 18:36.533
I love you even more.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.301
Thanks... I guess.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.368
Don't worry about the sex.

18:41.433 --> 18:43.334
It'll work itself out,

18:43.400 --> 18:45.334
just like the lawn dart.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.967
I love you, Charlie.

18:47.034 --> 18:48.500
Well, you should.

18:48.567 --> 18:51.067
I'm being really sensitive and
understanding and all that crap.

18:51.134 --> 18:54.368
Now, how about
another game?

18:54.433 --> 18:57.001
All right.

18:58.301 --> 18:59.567
I got to tell you.

18:59.634 --> 19:02.400
I'm kind of relieved to find
out I'm not the problem.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.967
Neither of us
is the problem.

19:04.034 --> 19:05.634
It's just that
I have feelings.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.400
Okay, for me, that
would be a problem.

19:08.467 --> 19:11.700
You do realize that Jake
just snuck out of the house.

19:11.767 --> 19:12.867
Well, he's grounded.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.600
How else is he gonna leave?

19:20.067 --> 19:24.201
Hey, how about the winner
of the next hand gets

19:24.268 --> 19:27.533
to be sexually satisfied without
any guilt or reciprocity?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.201
You have a good hand, don't you?

19:29.268 --> 19:30.533
No, not at all.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.234
All right, it's a bet.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.700
Gin.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.567
<i>Gaa!</i>

19:47.767 --> 19:50.467
Okay, I got to ask.

19:50.533 --> 19:54.167
Was that a real "gaa,"
or a mercy "gaa"?

19:54.234 --> 19:56.334
Oh, that was the real thing.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.967
So, it was good?

19:58.034 --> 20:00.134
Lawn dart good.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.834
You know what I think?

20:03.901 --> 20:06.734
I think the fact that you shared
your feelings with me,

20:06.800 --> 20:10.101
and I really listened,
made the sex more intimate

20:10.167 --> 20:12.800
and helped you overcome whatever
was inhibiting you from...

20:18.001 --> 20:19.667
Well, that's just rude.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.367
Morning.

20:28.434 --> 20:30.267
Morning.

20:29.834 --> 20:33.167
Hey, looks like your hair is
really filling in back there.

20:33.234 --> 20:36.667
Yeah, I think the pills
are starting to work.

20:39.734 --> 20:42.500
What?
