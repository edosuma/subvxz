00:06.083 --> 00:08.620
Up in the Pyrenees,

00:08.625 --> 00:10.616
there's about as pretty a patch
of country

00:10.625 --> 00:12.081
as you could ever hope to see.

00:12.083 --> 00:15.621
Peaceful forests, raging rivers,

00:15.625 --> 00:18.082
and Basque mountain men
who've been feudin'

00:18.083 --> 00:19.072
with France or Spain

00:19.083 --> 00:22.075
for as long as anyone can remember.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.620
Now and then,
an American tourist gets caught

00:25.125 --> 00:27.116
in the middle of one of
these private wars,

00:27.125 --> 00:30.117
and that's when I
usually get a call.

00:30.125 --> 00:33.117
When somebody's in trouble
and needs some rescuing.

01:28.709 --> 01:31.155
My mom was one of the great
kitchen experimenters--

01:32.709 --> 01:35.701
Japanese soup, Italian pasta,

01:35.709 --> 01:38.155
a terrific Basque stew.

01:39.709 --> 01:41.700
This one didn't come close.

02:14.208 --> 02:16.199
Hi.

02:16.208 --> 02:17.744
Dr. Gates,

02:17.750 --> 02:19.741
I've come to get you out of here.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.741
Name is MacGyver.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.742
My God!

02:24.750 --> 02:27.241
I'm glad to see you.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.740
But...

02:28.750 --> 02:31.241
I don't think I can sneak out
of here disguised the way

02:31.250 --> 02:32.740
you came in.

02:32.750 --> 02:36.242
It's the only towel
I brought with me.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.239
Here, try that on.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.741
Would you mind?

02:41.750 --> 02:44.241
Don't tell me you're shy.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.787
Yeah.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.786
Can you tell me
why they grabbed me?

02:49.792 --> 02:51.248
I mean,

02:51.250 --> 02:53.787
I'm a geologist.

02:53.792 --> 02:55.248
Well, we figure
this group just didn't

02:55.250 --> 02:56.239
know the difference between

02:56.792 --> 02:58.248
geology and physics.

02:58.250 --> 02:59.239
They probably thought

02:59.792 --> 03:01.248
you could build 'em an atom bomb.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.282
All right.

03:04.291 --> 03:05.781
let's see what they got here.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.827
All right.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.290
Time to get out of here.

03:31.291 --> 03:33.828
I'm all for that, but how?

03:33.834 --> 03:35.825
While they're distracted.

03:35.834 --> 03:37.825
Now I'd be willing to bet

03:37.834 --> 03:39.290
that someone's gonna be

03:39.291 --> 03:41.828
in a lot of hot water real soon.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.865
Oh, my God!

04:37.875 --> 04:39.866
Do you know
how far it is down there?

04:39.875 --> 04:42.366
No, ma'am, I don't.

04:46.917 --> 04:47.906
But I can't

04:47.917 --> 04:50.374
do that. I-I don't know
how to do that.

04:54.917 --> 04:56.908
You've got to do it.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.950
Another distraction?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.991
Hurry!

07:55.041 --> 07:58.033
MacGyver, are they still after us?

07:58.583 --> 08:01.040
No. Chances are,
those guys are all.

08:01.041 --> 08:03.032
washed up.

10:23.709 --> 10:26.746
Ah, what a life I lead.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.206
Riding the rapids

10:28.208 --> 10:30.199
in the Pyrenees Mountains
one day, and the next,

10:30.208 --> 10:32.745
crossing half the world
to help out a friend

10:32.750 --> 10:34.206
with a very weird problem

10:34.208 --> 10:36.745
in a very strange
part of the Amazon.

10:38.208 --> 10:41.746
I think I should
get an unlisted phone number.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.241
Still drawin' pictures
of everything, Charlie?

10:53.250 --> 10:56.242
MacGyver!

10:56.250 --> 10:58.741
How you doin', guy?

10:58.750 --> 11:00.741
So...

11:00.750 --> 11:02.240
is this the cause of the problem?

11:02.250 --> 11:03.740
I don't know.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.787
All we have is some
very strange phenomenon.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.783
A dozen species of birds
have been observed

11:08.792 --> 11:11.249
in desperate flight, terrified

11:11.250 --> 11:14.788
by something in the heart of
the rain forest.

11:14.792 --> 11:17.784
''Here be tigers and
unknown beasts...''

11:17.792 --> 11:19.248
Exactly, MacGyver.

11:19.250 --> 11:22.242
This is a mystery
that needs solving.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.786
That's why I'm so grateful

11:23.792 --> 11:26.283
you were able to arrange
this expedition.

11:26.291 --> 11:28.282
Just a small expedition.

11:28.792 --> 11:29.781
You and me.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.784
It's good to see you
again, Charlie.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.283
You know that you're the
only person in the world

11:52.291 --> 11:53.827
who calls me ''Charlie''?

11:57.291 --> 11:58.827
Hey, look at that!

11:58.834 --> 11:59.823
Look at those

11:59.834 --> 12:00.823
birds, MacGyver.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.828
Where are my binoculars?

12:03.834 --> 12:05.324
Psittaciformes.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.825
They're a hundred miles
from their natural territory.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.826
What could be upriver
that's so frightening?

12:16.333 --> 12:18.824
Here's our outpost, Charlie.

12:18.834 --> 12:21.826
We're going to need a guide
when we get there, MacGyver.

12:21.834 --> 12:25.326
Hope that won't be a problem.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.870
Well, I guess we better get ready.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.324
Take it easy, Charlie.

12:39.875 --> 12:42.332
Smooth.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.870
Now we've got to get
this equipment ashore.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.866
Charlie...

12:47.375 --> 12:48.865
go find a guide.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.365
I'll get the gear ashore.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.865
Okay.

12:51.875 --> 12:52.864
Got the permits.

12:53.375 --> 12:54.865
There won't be any problems.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.366
MacGyver.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.912
He says we can't have a guide.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.373
Not exactly.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.366
I am Commissioner Santos.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.367
And there are no guides.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.366
The Indian guides are all refusing

13:17.375 --> 13:19.366
to go deeper into the jungle.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.911
Any idea why?

13:20.917 --> 13:22.908
They are, uh, superstitious.

13:22.917 --> 13:24.407
They believe in dreams.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.908
Now they are dreaming of demons.

13:28.417 --> 13:29.907
I am sorry.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.407
There must be a way.

13:31.417 --> 13:33.908
We've gotta have a guide.
Hold on, hold on.

13:33.917 --> 13:34.906
Mr. Santos?

13:37.917 --> 13:39.407
Back in Orinas

13:39.417 --> 13:41.408
I kept hearing the name of
a cocoa planter

13:41.417 --> 13:43.908
with a place around here-- Trumbo?

13:43.917 --> 13:45.953
Lucien Trumbo.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.950
An impossible man.

13:47.959 --> 13:49.950
He lives two days up the river,

13:49.959 --> 13:51.415
on the far side of nowhere.

13:51.417 --> 13:54.955
Well, possibly we could
radio this Trumbo,

13:55.417 --> 13:56.953
and he could provide us with
a guide.

13:56.959 --> 13:59.416
Dr. Alden, he has no radio.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.954
Even if he did, it's pointless
to call him.

14:01.959 --> 14:04.951
Well, certainly he must care
about the ecology of the region.

14:04.959 --> 14:05.948
Eh!

14:06.458 --> 14:08.949
He cares only about
his cocoa plantation.

14:08.959 --> 14:10.449
You see,

14:10.458 --> 14:12.449
I'm the Government Commissioner
here.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.949
Which means I am the Law.

14:15.458 --> 14:20.452
But Lucien Trumbo recognizes
no law except his own.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.449
That sounds like an interesting guy.

14:23.959 --> 14:26.450
Maybe we ought to look this guy up.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.450
The last time I saw Trumbo,

14:29.458 --> 14:31.449
he took a shot at me.

14:43.458 --> 14:44.994
Morning.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.492
Think we'll be there this morning?

14:49.500 --> 14:51.991
so. Ah, maybe

14:54.500 --> 14:57.492
You know, I was wondering.

14:58.001 --> 15:00.993
If the Indians are so terrified,

15:01.001 --> 15:04.994
how does Trumbo keep his workforce?

15:05.000 --> 15:08.993
Maybe they're more afraid of him.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.491
MacGyver, something's not right.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.991
It's a little too quiet out here.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.992
Well, maybe this Trumbo's
got some answers for us.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.538
This river is getting
pretty narrow, MacGyver.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.533
We must be getting close.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.533
Slow it down.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.999
Geez.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.534
My God, what does it mean?

15:52.542 --> 15:54.032
I don't know.

15:54.041 --> 15:56.032
A warning, maybe?

16:01.542 --> 16:04.579
MacGyver...
there's something ahead.

16:05.041 --> 16:06.577
That's it.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.574
I am Lucien Trumbo.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.578
This is my land,
and you're trespassing.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.573
Can't you people read?

16:34.083 --> 16:37.075
The sign says ''keep out.''

16:37.083 --> 16:39.574
This is outrageous.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.575
This man shot at us!

16:43.083 --> 16:44.619
Charlie...

16:48.625 --> 16:52.072
This is a scientific expedition.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.074
I'm Dr. Charles Alden,

16:54.083 --> 16:56.074
and this is my associate,
Mr. MacGyver,

16:56.083 --> 16:58.074
and we are from the
Inter-Americas Institute

16:58.083 --> 17:00.620
of Tropical Ornithology.

17:00.625 --> 17:03.082
And I am not interested in birds.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.618
Hey, Mr. Trumbo?

17:05.625 --> 17:06.614
How long's that pump

17:06.625 --> 17:08.115
been giving you trouble like that?

17:12.125 --> 17:14.616
Are you an engineer?

17:14.625 --> 17:16.616
Well, no, not exactly.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.115
From the sound of her,I'd say

17:18.625 --> 17:20.115
the old gal will be
out of commission

17:20.125 --> 17:21.114
before the end of the day.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.614
You've got a busted
piston in there.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.661
And I'll just bet that
pump is the key

17:24.666 --> 17:26.657
to your whole irrigation system.

17:26.666 --> 17:29.659
Perhaps I could ask you to
repair it.

17:29.667 --> 17:30.656
Perhaps

17:30.667 --> 17:32.658
you could help us out a little.

17:33.125 --> 17:34.114
Luiz.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.116
Grab the boat.

17:37.125 --> 17:40.663
We need a guide
to take us back into the jungle.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.124
I'll not put any of my people
in unnecessary danger.

17:43.125 --> 17:44.661
Good day, gentlemen.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.657
Well, maybe I'll take a look
at that pump anyway.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.657
I don't bargain, MacGyver.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.658
Well, it's a shame

17:54.667 --> 17:58.660
to see a nice piece of machinery
like that just ruin itself.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.157
All right.
It's yours to fix.

18:24.166 --> 18:27.203
You got some place
I can work on this?

18:27.208 --> 18:29.199
Yeah.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.199
This is quite a spread.

18:32.208 --> 18:34.199
I was here before the
first buildings.

18:34.208 --> 18:37.200
Trumbo had only eight acres then.

18:37.208 --> 18:40.200
And now you can see...

18:41.208 --> 18:43.199
How long you been with Trumbo?

18:43.208 --> 18:46.200
He found me when I was a child
in the jungle.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.206
What about your own people?

18:49.750 --> 18:51.206
The Amap tribesmenattacked us.

18:51.208 --> 18:54.200
They killed my fat her and
took my mother.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.745
I was too young, so they left me.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.206
Trumbo found me.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.199
He gave me a place.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.740
Pulled the piston, hmm?

19:06.750 --> 19:07.739
Yeah.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.740
It's busted.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.241
But we got lucky--we found
both pieces.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.241
Not so lucky.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.241
My welding equipment
uses acetylene gas,

19:17.250 --> 19:19.741
and the tanks are empty.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.742
I've been waiting months
for supplies.

19:23.750 --> 19:24.785
Thank you, MacGyver,

19:25.250 --> 19:26.786
but I'm afraid your efforts
were useless.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.248
You know, you sure don't strike me

19:28.250 --> 19:30.241
as the type of fellow
who'd give up so easy.

19:32.792 --> 19:36.239
I don't waste time on the impossible.

19:37.792 --> 19:39.783
Well, maybe we can whip up something

19:39.792 --> 19:41.783
out of what you got around here.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.828
Electric arc welding.

20:06.834 --> 20:09.280
I could use a man of your
talents around here, MacGyver.

20:11.834 --> 20:14.280
Well, the way I see things,
Mr. Trumbo,

20:14.291 --> 20:15.827
you don't need anybody.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.282
Maybe a little cheap labor
and a few good machines.

20:19.834 --> 20:20.823
Hey, mister,

20:20.834 --> 20:24.281
I've fought this jungle back,
cut it down,

20:24.291 --> 20:26.828
created my boundaries, my world.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.824
No one else had the will to do that.

20:29.834 --> 20:32.325
And my Indians are paid well

20:32.333 --> 20:34.324
for their work, MacGyer.

20:39.834 --> 20:42.325
The power of the American dollar.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.324
Half-dollar, actually.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.325
Why don't we see if we can
get your pump going again.

21:08.875 --> 21:13.869
I made my peace with this
country a long time ago.

21:13.875 --> 21:16.867
I don't try to change it
or even understand it.

21:16.875 --> 21:17.864
I hold what I have.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.365
That is all I need.

21:19.375 --> 21:22.367
Personally,
I like a little variety,

21:22.375 --> 21:25.367
and some good people to share it with.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.912
I used to feel like that once.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.373
Until my wife died here.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.373
Mr. Trumbo, won't you reconsider

21:33.375 --> 21:34.911
and provide us with a guide?

21:35.917 --> 21:37.373
I know there is something happening

21:37.375 --> 21:38.911
in the deep jungle.

21:38.917 --> 21:41.909
We have shot animals
trying to break down my fences.

21:41.917 --> 21:43.373
They were out of control,

21:43.375 --> 21:46.913
running in panic from some danger.

21:47.417 --> 21:50.409
But I will not risk any of my people.

21:52.917 --> 21:54.908
Mr. Trumbo,

21:54.917 --> 21:56.908
we'll be shoving off in the morning.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.908
I want to thank you for
your hospitality.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.908
Mr. MacGyver,

22:01.917 --> 22:05.409
the pump at the river helps
to fill my dam.

22:05.417 --> 22:08.409
It made it possible for me
to build my plantation,

22:08.417 --> 22:12.410
to hold it in drought,
defend it in flood.

22:12.417 --> 22:13.406
It's filling again.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.408
I'm grateful, MacGyver.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.408
Then why won't you

22:17.417 --> 22:18.953
at least consider the possibility?

22:19.417 --> 22:20.953
I told you

22:20.959 --> 22:24.406
I will not risk any of my people.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.449
But I will guide you myself.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.949
We leave at daybreak.

22:35.458 --> 22:38.450
Okay.

22:58.667 --> 23:00.123
What?

23:00.667 --> 23:02.123
What could possibly cause
panic flight

23:02.125 --> 23:04.116
in both birds and small
ground animals?

23:04.125 --> 23:05.661
Well, that's a good question,
Charlie.

23:06.125 --> 23:07.114
There's an Indian village

23:07.125 --> 23:08.661
about three kilometers up country.

23:08.667 --> 23:10.123
Maybe they know more.

23:10.125 --> 23:12.116
Well, let's go.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.661
Hold it.

23:13.667 --> 23:14.656
What is it?

23:16.667 --> 23:18.157
Listen.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.157
That's this way.

23:35.667 --> 23:37.658
Dear God.

23:40.709 --> 23:43.701
Soldier ants.

23:43.709 --> 23:44.698
That's incredible.

23:44.709 --> 23:47.155
No wonder every living thing fled.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.702
Look at them.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.702
In the billions.

23:52.166 --> 23:55.158
Marabunda.

23:55.166 --> 23:58.203
The Indians believe
nothing can stop them.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.700
Well, that is
very close to the truth.

24:00.709 --> 24:02.199
They live peacefully
40, sometimes 50 years,

24:02.208 --> 24:06.702
gigantic ant civilizations
in their remote colonies,

24:06.709 --> 24:08.700
and they breed...

24:08.709 --> 24:10.199
until some internal clock

24:10.208 --> 24:12.199
ticks to its appointed moment,

24:12.208 --> 24:13.698
and they erupt.

24:13.709 --> 24:17.201
An eating machine, two miles wide

24:17.208 --> 24:19.745
and ten miles long.

24:22.208 --> 24:23.744
Heading northeast.

24:28.750 --> 24:29.739
The village.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.786
There's a woman trapped

24:59.792 --> 25:00.781
under that canoe!

25:07.250 --> 25:09.241
It's much too heavy to lift.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.787
If we roll it,
we'll break her legs.

25:11.792 --> 25:13.248
Hold on-- you'll be all right.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.786
Trumbo, give me a hand.

25:22.291 --> 25:23.781
Get on the other side of the boat.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.783
Thread this through
when I give it to you.

25:51.291 --> 25:53.282
Incredible!

25:53.291 --> 25:55.282
That's fantastic!

25:55.291 --> 25:57.282
I've never seen anything like this.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.324
Charlie,

26:09.333 --> 26:10.322
bring me that pole.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.869
MacGyver,

26:25.875 --> 26:26.864
the ants are getting closer.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.324
I got to check
the other side of the village.

26:29.333 --> 26:30.322
Charlie...

26:33.875 --> 26:34.864
All right, I'll hold it.

26:34.875 --> 26:36.331
See if you can get her clear.

26:51.375 --> 26:52.865
Fantastic!

26:55.875 --> 26:57.365
Oh...

26:57.375 --> 26:59.912
this is incredible!

27:17.917 --> 27:19.407
Oh!

27:22.917 --> 27:23.906
MacGyver!

27:23.917 --> 27:25.407
Over here!

27:25.417 --> 27:26.907
This way!

27:26.917 --> 27:28.908
Charlie!

27:36.417 --> 27:37.406
Charlie!

27:39.417 --> 27:40.953
Charlie!

27:40.959 --> 27:42.950
Don't be a fool!

27:44.417 --> 27:45.953
He's dead.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.949
Put those branches
closer to the wall.

28:16.959 --> 28:18.995
The fire will have to stop them.

28:37.001 --> 28:38.992
Charlie was a pretty good artist.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.990
He caught you.

28:43.001 --> 28:44.491
Yeah.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.492
Were you friends a long time?

28:49.001 --> 28:50.992
I'm going to miss him.

28:55.500 --> 29:00.494
So... you think the ants are
going to come towards us, huh?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.992
Well, we saw the main army

29:04.000 --> 29:06.491
about six kilometers
to the west moving northeast,

29:06.500 --> 29:08.991
but they'll be blocked
by the river, so they'll turn...

29:09.000 --> 29:11.491
Right into us.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.493
I will be ready with fire at
my front walls if necessary.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.489
Wait a minute.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.990
You're not planning on being here

29:18.000 --> 29:19.536
long enough to find out, are you?

29:19.542 --> 29:20.998
Trumbo!

29:21.000 --> 29:22.536
The workers!

29:22.542 --> 29:23.531
They've all run away!

29:24.000 --> 29:26.537
Some are taking the boats!

29:29.542 --> 29:30.998
Stop!

29:31.000 --> 29:32.991
No, you mustn't go! Stop!

29:33.000 --> 29:33.989
Listen to me!

29:34.000 --> 29:36.537
Hear what I have to say.

29:36.542 --> 29:37.531
You know me.

29:37.542 --> 29:38.531
I've never lied to you.

29:38.542 --> 29:40.533
I will not try to tell you

29:40.542 --> 29:42.032
the ants are not a danger.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.531
They are powerful.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.032
But we are powerful, too!

29:45.041 --> 29:48.033
Together, we conquered this jungle.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.032
I fought to make this place.

29:50.542 --> 29:52.032
I will fight to keep it!

29:52.041 --> 29:53.531
We will fight!

29:55.041 --> 29:56.531
The ants will come.

29:56.542 --> 29:58.578
We will destroy them.

29:58.583 --> 30:02.576
No! I have seen the ants before.

30:02.583 --> 30:05.040
We know what they can do.

30:05.583 --> 30:07.574
No, we will not stay.

30:08.041 --> 30:10.032
You will obey me!

30:10.041 --> 30:12.032
No, Trumbo!

30:22.083 --> 30:24.074
Don't leave! Don't leave!

30:24.083 --> 30:25.573
You must stay and fight!

30:34.583 --> 30:36.073
Keep out of this, MacGyver!

30:36.083 --> 30:38.074
They have a right to leave, Trumbo!

30:38.083 --> 30:41.621
They're scared; let them go.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.620
All right, let them run.

30:48.625 --> 30:51.082
I don't need them.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.072
I don't need anybody!

30:52.083 --> 30:54.074
But the ants--they will kill you.

30:54.083 --> 30:56.074
This plantation is my life!

30:56.625 --> 30:58.616
I will not give it up!

31:05.125 --> 31:06.615
You can still call to the boat.

31:06.625 --> 31:09.617
They'll wait for you.

31:11.125 --> 31:12.615
No. This is

31:12.625 --> 31:14.616
my home, too.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.116
What about you?

31:17.125 --> 31:19.116
Me? I'm kind of interested to see

31:19.125 --> 31:21.662
if that weld of mine is
going to hold up.

31:24.125 --> 31:26.116
Come on.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.157
I got an idea.

32:00.166 --> 32:01.702
It has to do with all that

32:02.166 --> 32:03.155
water you got stored.

32:03.166 --> 32:05.157
Now, as I understand things,

32:05.166 --> 32:06.702
you got the river flowing up here

32:06.709 --> 32:07.698
and the tributary into it.

32:07.709 --> 32:09.700
And you got all these
irrigation ditches, too.

32:09.709 --> 32:12.155
Well, if you flooded the ditches,

32:12.166 --> 32:14.157
they'd become like little moats

32:14.166 --> 32:17.158
and maybe force the ants down
into the river.

32:17.709 --> 32:19.199
What do you think?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.699
I think that is one
hell of an idea.

32:28.208 --> 32:30.199
What if it fails?

32:30.208 --> 32:31.698
How you fixed for gasoline?

32:31.709 --> 32:33.199
Some.

32:35.208 --> 32:37.699
Well, I don't know
how good ants are at swimming,

32:37.709 --> 32:39.199
but I'd be willing to bet

32:39.208 --> 32:41.199
a good fire would get
their attention.

32:41.208 --> 32:42.744
What if that doesn't work?

32:46.208 --> 32:50.747
I think we'd have to crack open
that dam of yours.

32:50.750 --> 32:51.739
A flood?

32:51.750 --> 32:53.206
It'll wipe out the entire crop.

32:53.208 --> 32:54.197
It'll wash away the topsoil.

32:54.208 --> 32:57.200
Maybe even this house.

32:59.750 --> 33:01.741
I don't think it'll come to that,

33:02.250 --> 33:04.241
but we better get started.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.241
Those ants are on their way.

33:23.792 --> 33:24.781
You got the garden hose?

33:25.250 --> 33:26.786
Yeah. What're you doing?

33:27.250 --> 33:29.787
Going to build a flame thrower.

33:29.792 --> 33:33.239
This little bit of kitchen
magic'll thicken the gasoline,

33:33.250 --> 33:35.787
stabilize it so it'll burn,
not explode.

33:39.291 --> 33:40.280
Listen, you got a hacksaw?

33:40.291 --> 33:42.282
I'll get one. Good.

33:42.291 --> 33:43.781
I hope we don't need all that.

33:44.291 --> 33:46.782
The water in the ditches--
that has to stop them.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.282
I'll send Luiz to the dam.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.282
Yeah.

33:52.792 --> 33:54.783
Luiz, you must stand guard
at the dam

33:55.291 --> 33:56.781
and flood the ditches.

33:56.792 --> 33:59.283
Keep the water level full
so the ants don't cross.

33:59.291 --> 34:01.828
Now, if we need more water,
we'll signal you.

34:12.291 --> 34:14.291
Doesn't look so tough, does it?

34:14.291 --> 34:17.829
After all I've done--

34:17.833 --> 34:20.826
fought to build here--
this is what threatens it all.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.824
You got that one,
Trumbo.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.824
Trouble is, a couple billion
of his relatives

34:29.833 --> 34:30.822
are coming to the funeral.

35:17.375 --> 35:20.367
Well, the ditches
are full.

35:20.375 --> 35:21.911
Now we wait.

35:23.917 --> 35:25.908
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.908
Well, the horses know
something's going on.

35:32.917 --> 35:35.374
Yes. The ants are here.

36:40.001 --> 36:42.447
Uh, you better take a look at this.

36:49.001 --> 36:50.992
They're coming across the water.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.457
The level's too low.

36:52.458 --> 36:54.449
Signal Luiz for more water.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.491
The water isn't coming.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.991
It's not happening.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.991
Luiz wouldn't run.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.991
Then he's dead.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.991
No!

37:37.000 --> 37:38.490
Luiz! Luiz!

37:38.500 --> 37:39.535
Trumbo!

37:41.542 --> 37:43.999
Damn, I think I tore something.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.991
Trumbo, it's too late.

37:46.000 --> 37:46.989
They're too close.

38:06.041 --> 38:07.531
All right, Trumbo, this is it.

38:07.542 --> 38:09.533
Start pumping.

38:25.041 --> 38:28.033
Burn them all.

38:57.583 --> 38:59.619
I feel like Nero burning Rome.

38:59.625 --> 39:02.617
Yeah, well, keep it coming, Nero.

40:01.166 --> 40:04.158
Empty...

40:04.166 --> 40:06.657
but we did it.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.658
We did it.

40:12.166 --> 40:14.657
What does it all mean, MacGyver?

40:14.667 --> 40:18.159
I worked a lifetime here,
and it's gone in one afternoon.

40:19.709 --> 40:22.701
Easy come, easy go.

40:58.208 --> 41:01.746
So they do inherit the earth...

41:01.750 --> 41:04.207
in just a few more hours.

41:06.208 --> 41:08.199
No.

41:09.208 --> 41:10.197
They crossed the moat.

41:10.208 --> 41:11.744
They've survived the fire.

41:11.750 --> 41:12.739
They've won.

41:12.750 --> 41:15.742
What more can we do?

41:15.750 --> 41:19.242
Blow the dam,
flood the fields, drown 'em.

41:19.250 --> 41:21.241
Blow the dam how? We have
no dynamite.

41:21.250 --> 41:23.741
No... but you got enough
around here,

41:23.750 --> 41:25.240
I might be able to fake it.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.240
Even so, there's a mountain of ants

41:28.250 --> 41:29.239
between here and the dam.

41:29.250 --> 41:30.740
How would you even get there?

41:30.750 --> 41:33.241
We're out of gasoline,
and we're out of miracles.

41:34.250 --> 41:37.742
So now's the time to
start thinking.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.787
And the first thing
I started thinking about

41:42.792 --> 41:45.784
was how to take that dam apart.

41:45.792 --> 41:48.249
Start with nitrate from fertilizer,

41:48.250 --> 41:49.786
cellulose from plant bark.

41:54.250 --> 41:58.789
Stir, don't shake,
with a drip or two of acid.

41:58.792 --> 42:02.284
So, this is nitroglycerin.

42:02.291 --> 42:03.781
Nitromanide, actually.

42:04.291 --> 42:05.781
It's a little less touchy,

42:05.792 --> 42:07.783
kind of a chemical kissing cousin.

42:09.291 --> 42:12.283
All right, fill this with this.

42:12.792 --> 42:13.781
Now, where's that garden hose?

42:13.792 --> 42:14.781
What for?

42:15.291 --> 42:16.280
I need to make a suit of armor.

43:36.375 --> 43:38.866
Ready, MacGyver?

43:38.875 --> 43:40.365
Good luck.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.991
He did it.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.992
MacGyver, you did it!

46:15.542 --> 46:17.533
MacGyver!

46:23.041 --> 46:26.033
MacGyver.

46:50.583 --> 46:52.574
MacGyver!

46:55.583 --> 46:57.574
What a mess.

46:57.583 --> 46:59.039
Look at this.Well, so are you.

46:59.041 --> 47:02.579
And who cares? We won!

47:02.583 --> 47:06.075
And, hell, this is more
than I started with.

47:06.083 --> 47:08.074
I'll do it again...

47:08.583 --> 47:10.073
better this time.

47:10.083 --> 47:12.074
I'll bet you do.

47:12.083 --> 47:15.075
I owe you...

47:15.083 --> 47:17.074
We know what
I owe you...

47:17.583 --> 47:19.619
but I'm going to ask you
one more favor.

47:19.625 --> 47:22.617
You come back in one year from now,

47:22.625 --> 47:25.617
take a look at what you
helped build.

47:25.625 --> 47:27.081
You bet.

47:28.625 --> 47:31.082
Come on.
