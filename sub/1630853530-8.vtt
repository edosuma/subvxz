WEBVTT

00:11.178 --> 00:12.763
Would you like some coffee, Commander?

00:13.430 --> 00:16.350
Thanks, but I've had enough
freeze-dried battery acid for one day.

00:16.433 --> 00:20.479
No, no, no, no, no. I stole
some Helios packets of French vanilla.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.147
Really good. You should try it.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.283
What the hell is this?

00:33.367 --> 00:34.368
A marsquake?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.370
I don't think so.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.704
What the hell is going on?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.586
It's a landslide.
The pattern is very clear on seismograph.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.130
Not at all like quake. You see?

00:47.214 --> 00:49.716
Yes. Isosceles rise in the highs.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.426
Not a huge P-wave spike.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.303
And the epicenter's near…

00:55.222 --> 00:56.306
the Helios site.

00:57.057 --> 00:57.891
Oh, no.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.525
Helios Base, Happy Valley.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.819
Helios Base, Happy Valley.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.281
Helios, Happy Valley. Do you copy?

01:14.700 --> 01:16.285
-Helios, Happy Valley.
-Okay.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.369
Can you hear me?

01:17.452 --> 01:20.205
Phoenix is eight minutes away
from acquisition of signal.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.416
That's when they'll have eyes
on their base from orbit.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.294
Maybe then they'll be able to tell us
what the hell's going on there.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.795
Meantime, you two suit up.

01:26.879 --> 01:30.883
Prep both rovers. Load 'em up with
all the emergency gear they can carry.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.927
And fill up the tanks. There's no telling
how long we'll be out there.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.345
-Helios, Happy Valley.
-Roger, boss.

01:35.429 --> 01:39.558
And whatever interpersonal crap
you two have going on stops now.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.934
Understand?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.311
-Understood.
-Understood.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.942
Helios, Happy Valley. Do you copy?

01:50.360 --> 01:53.655
Helios, Happy Valley. Can you hear me?

01:54.907 --> 01:57.910
Helios, Happy Valley. Do you copy?

02:28.065 --> 02:31.777
Mayday, Mayday. This is Alexei Poletov.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.947
Anyone on this channel?
Please respond. Over.

02:42.913 --> 02:43.956
Mayday. Mayday.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.749
This is Alexei Poletov.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.514
Anyone on this channel, please respond.
Over.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.060
Anyone on this channel, please respond.
Over.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.943
Isabel, do you copy?

03:15.237 --> 03:17.030
Isabel, do you copy?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.576
Anyone, come in. Please, anyone.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.246
Come in, please!

03:25.163 --> 03:26.415
Please!

03:28.667 --> 03:30.335
Come in. Do you read?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.548
Come in, come in, please. Please!

04:08.916 --> 04:11.502
Oh, God, no. Nick!

04:12.669 --> 04:14.880
No. Nick.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.475
So…

05:53.645 --> 05:54.646
This is weird.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.191
Shouldn't you be, like,

05:57.274 --> 06:00.110
negotiating a nuclear missile treaty
right now or something?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.555
That was a hard letter to write.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.894
You lied to me.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.899
Yep.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.902
Why?

06:45.322 --> 06:47.324
I know what it is to want something.

06:49.868 --> 06:54.081
So, I just made it easier for you
to go after the thing you really wanted.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.461
How generous of you.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.421
You didn't even put up a fight.

07:01.505 --> 07:05.676
You left me
without saying a word to my face.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.150
I used to think a lot
about what our life would be.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.696
Cute house with a little fence.

07:26.738 --> 07:30.158
A dog. Maybe a cat. Although…

07:33.120 --> 07:34.705
I'd make you coffee in the mornings

07:34.788 --> 07:38.542
and then write out on the patio
while you went to work.

07:39.877 --> 07:40.961
Sounds nice.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.090
Yeah, it would've been.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.634
But it wouldn't last.

07:49.094 --> 07:52.598
Eventually, you'd regret what you gave up.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.894
It would start trickling in
after some argument we'd had.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.896
You'd think about it while in the shower,

07:58.979 --> 08:01.356
maybe stuck in traffic
on your way to work.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.651
And it would just eat at you.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.945
And how could it not?

08:07.779 --> 08:08.780
I mean,

08:09.573 --> 08:11.909
you were headed for such great things,

08:12.993 --> 08:13.994
and I knew it.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.497
From the day I met you.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.501
So, yeah.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.128
I gave you up.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.591
Because I thought maybe one day,

08:27.674 --> 08:31.011
you could make a real difference
for people like us.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.850
But I guess I was wrong.

08:51.323 --> 08:55.577
When I saw you being sworn in,
I was so happy.

08:55.661 --> 08:58.497
You know,
finally things were going to change.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.415
But from that day on,

09:00.499 --> 09:04.670
I have just watched you make
compromise after compromise.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.297
Sometimes you have to settle
for what's possible.

09:14.263 --> 09:18.058
I wonder what the girl I met 20 years ago
at the Outpost would say about that.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.519
She had this fire.

09:22.813 --> 09:25.440
Ready to take on anything and everything.

09:26.859 --> 09:28.861
I'm not as powerful as you imagine.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.363
Look at me now.

09:31.989 --> 09:35.117
I had to sneak out of the house
to visit the love of my life.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.544
Well…

09:46.920 --> 09:48.839
it's good to hear you say that anyway.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.496
My guess is, it's for you.

10:30.088 --> 10:33.467
Madam President, you need to come
with me. There's a developing situation.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.323
Keep walking.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.617
I can't see you in all this dust.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.369
I think I see you.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.453
Alexei.

11:03.664 --> 11:04.873
Louisa.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.875
There you are. Oh, God.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.337
Oh, God.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.755
Are you okay?

11:12.714 --> 11:13.924
Yes, I'm okay.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.094
Good. Have you found any of the others?

11:18.220 --> 11:22.349
Yes. Yeah. I found someone
just back that way.

11:23.809 --> 11:24.810
Who?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.604
Isabel.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.245
The MSAM.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.454
The habs.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.623
The fuel factory.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.959
They're all gone.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.630
Could we be the only survivors?

12:00.179 --> 12:03.223
Phoenix, Happy Valley.
We're about to head over in our rovers

12:03.307 --> 12:04.641
to begin the search and rescue.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.226
Roger, Happy Valley.

12:06.310 --> 12:10.397
We have been able to raise hab 2 and will
send their position to your rovers.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.567
Lars Hagstrom, Kuznetsov
and Dr. Mayakovsky are alive.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.027
Any other survivors?

12:17.487 --> 12:19.156
We don't know yet.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.116
We have had no contact with hab 1

12:21.200 --> 12:23.619
or any of the other astronauts
who were on the surface.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.871
No word from Ed or Danny Stevens?

12:26.830 --> 12:27.915
Not yet.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.333
Shit.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.294
Okay. Thank you, Phoenix.

12:32.836 --> 12:35.172
Tell hab 2 we expect to see them
in two hours.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.175
-They're having a hard time receiving us.
-Wilco, Danielle.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.427
The landslide wrecked
their omnidirectional antenna.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.596
They can talk to us in orbit,
but not to the surface.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.640
They are trying to rig the spare.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.183
Phoenix out.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.271
Adarsh, have a look at this.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.943
I've seen strip mining demolition
on Earth and the moon,

12:56.026 --> 12:57.694
but nothing that compares to this.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.197
Christ.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.784
I'm gonna switch to InSAR and sync it
with images from our last pass.

13:03.867 --> 13:07.621
It should penetrate the dust,
so we can locate any survivors.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.504
My God. There is nothing left.

13:15.587 --> 13:18.006
It's just caved-in lava tubes
and debris flow.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.676
We need to reach out to NASA.
They're mounting the rescue efforts,

13:20.759 --> 13:23.804
and we need to get everybody that we can
working on this.

13:23.887 --> 13:27.933
She's right. If there are other survivors
trapped in that debris field,

13:28.433 --> 13:29.768
they're running out of air.

13:29.852 --> 13:33.188
Well, if Margo Madison wants to
send over her team, I'm sure--

13:33.272 --> 13:36.149
No. They have more working resources
on the ground up there,

13:36.233 --> 13:37.734
-so we go to them.
-Agreed.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.028
Okay. Let's go.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.492
Uh, I'm gonna stay behind,

13:45.576 --> 13:47.911
reach out to the families
of those that are unaccounted for.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.955
Henry Zinman can make those calls.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.039
Not calls.

13:51.123 --> 13:54.251
We need to go to them personally
and deliver the news and stay with them.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.087
Understood.

14:11.810 --> 14:12.811
Dev?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.524
Dev.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.576
I'm gonna do everything in my power

14:29.161 --> 14:30.454
to find Ed.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.031
What's happening?

15:06.657 --> 15:08.158
Hold still. I'm cleaning your wound.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.045
What the hell happened?

15:20.128 --> 15:21.713
Landslide from the ridge.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.509
It knocked the hab over?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.303
Worse. Buried us.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.806
And who knows how far down we are.

15:30.889 --> 15:31.890
Jesus.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.312
So we're trapped in the air lock.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.147
Yeah.

15:39.231 --> 15:43.819
Good news, cabin pressure's holding
steady, so there appear to be no leaks.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.530
Emergency beacon's broadcasting.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.907
Good. That's good.

15:49.908 --> 15:52.661
-That'll lead them to us.
-If we're not buried too deep.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.331
Sorry.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.751
Sorry.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.337
Gotta make sure it's as clean as possible.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.176
How bad is it?

16:09.052 --> 16:10.053
Bad enough.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.599
Looks like you got hit by a piece
of shrapnel when the drill came apart.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.475
Punched a hole in your abdomen.

16:17.603 --> 16:18.604
Exit wound?

16:20.439 --> 16:21.440
No.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.826
Fuck it. Just seal me up.
When they find us,

16:32.910 --> 16:35.204
-Mayakovsky will have to operate.
-If he's still alive.

16:35.287 --> 16:38.081
Hey, your bedside manner
leaves a hell of a lot to be desired.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.249
I'll work on that.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.669
Okay. I'm gonna bandage it.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.380
-It's gonna hurt.
-Yeah.

16:51.470 --> 16:56.308
Goddamn motherfucking son of a bitch.

17:11.906 --> 17:12.907
Okay, done.

17:16.994 --> 17:21.333
Ventilators aren't working, so all we have
is the atmosphere in this compartment.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.587
And the oxygen in our suits.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.925
And once that's gone, we suffocate.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.291
Listen up, people.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.918
You all know each other,
at least by reputation,

18:05.002 --> 18:07.212
and I won't waste time with introductions.

18:07.713 --> 18:10.465
Dev, is there anything new
we need to know?

18:10.549 --> 18:13.844
Yes, both our MSAM and one of our habs
were buried in the landslide.

18:14.428 --> 18:17.389
But our second hab managed
to avoid major damage.

18:17.472 --> 18:21.226
So we can't bring any more personnel
or supplies down from Phoenix.

18:21.310 --> 18:24.313
And without the MSAM,
everyone on the surface is stranded.

18:26.315 --> 18:28.150
That's a problem for downstream.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.320
Time is our enemy right now.

18:31.403 --> 18:35.032
Danielle Poole's team should reach
your hab 2 in about one hour.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.827
Our first task is
to find the missing people.

18:58.222 --> 19:01.934
-Commander, I'm glad to see you.
-The feeling's mutual.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.603
Have y'all been able to mount a search?

19:04.686 --> 19:06.271
So far, no success.

19:08.607 --> 19:11.568
Has there been any communication
from my dad or any of the others?

19:11.652 --> 19:13.987
Omni antennas were damaged
in the landslide.

19:14.071 --> 19:17.616
So we must fix UHF communications
before we can hear them.

19:17.699 --> 19:18.700
Right.

19:18.784 --> 19:21.662
Dr. Mayakovsky has been working
on the system as best he can.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.248
So there's been no sign
of any of the survivors?

19:24.957 --> 19:30.003
Corrado, Poletov, Castillo, Mueller
were all on the surface when it happened.

19:30.087 --> 19:31.088
There's been no word.

19:34.091 --> 19:36.468
Commander Baldwin and Stevens
were in hab 1.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.346
They could still be alive
and trapped inside.

19:56.572 --> 19:57.573
That's good.

19:59.908 --> 20:02.494
-Hey, Danny, you should have some.
-You should sit down.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.623
You're riding adrenaline. If you don't
watch out, you're gonna crash.

20:07.499 --> 20:08.792
It's fine.

20:08.876 --> 20:11.211
Won't stay that way
if you keep moving around.

20:15.007 --> 20:18.343
Okay, I'll sit after you have some water.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.179
I'm fine.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.055
Yeah?

20:24.600 --> 20:25.684
You don't look fine.

20:26.977 --> 20:27.978
You're sweating.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.396
So?

20:29.479 --> 20:32.816
So, it's cold in here,
and the temperature's dropping.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.282
-Hey, look at me.
-Why?

20:41.116 --> 20:42.242
I said look at me.

20:47.539 --> 20:48.916
Told you to get off those pills.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.835
-You're starting to go through withdrawal.
-Spare me the Sunday sermon.

20:53.128 --> 20:56.757
You've been shooting anabolics into
your ass for the last, what, five years?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.800
That's not at all…

21:00.469 --> 21:01.553
What's it matter now?

21:02.888 --> 21:05.015
It matters 'cause when we get outta here--

21:05.098 --> 21:06.099
Get outta here?

21:07.726 --> 21:10.521
Don't you get it? We're not getting out.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.606
Search party's probably
already locked onto our beacon by now.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.191
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.486
'Cause we could be buried
under 50 meters of regolith or more.

21:18.153 --> 21:19.738
Rest of our crew's probably dead anyway.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.949
Even if they are,
NASA will still come for us.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.368
We have maybe six hours of breathable air.

21:25.827 --> 21:29.414
Even if they started digging right now,
they'll probably never reach us in time.

21:29.498 --> 21:31.500
Okay, stop. Just stop.

21:44.346 --> 21:45.430
Thank God.

21:45.514 --> 21:46.515
Who is it?

21:55.399 --> 21:57.067
Can't hear you.

22:12.666 --> 22:16.170
So, if we walk back
from our original position

22:16.253 --> 22:19.965
at our walking speed
at around two kilometers an hour…

22:20.048 --> 22:23.510
It puts us right here,

22:23.594 --> 22:25.470
when we dug ourselves out.

22:26.346 --> 22:32.269
And… this is where we found
Castillo and Corrado.

22:33.312 --> 22:34.563
Hab 1's there?

22:35.063 --> 22:38.775
You think you can go back out?
Lead the search for Ed and Danny?

22:39.484 --> 22:42.613
Good. Then grab yourself
some coffee and some food.

22:43.238 --> 22:46.200
The sun's going down,
but this day is not done.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.076
I'm going with you.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.705
Okay. All right.

22:54.625 --> 22:57.419
All right. Let's get those
coordinates to NASA and Helios.

22:57.961 --> 23:01.965
We think astronauts Corrado,
Castillo, Poletov and Mueller

23:02.049 --> 23:04.801
were about here when the mountain fell.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.846
Then we move those positions
onto the current situation.

23:07.930 --> 23:10.349
Where Mueller and Poletov
dug themselves out.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.810
So granular debris flow
moves in a somewhat uniform path.

23:13.894 --> 23:15.103
Like a mudslide.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.314
So our starting assumption is that hab 1

23:17.397 --> 23:20.400
is buried
not far from where they ended up.

23:20.484 --> 23:23.028
If we're lucky,
this should give us a fighting chance

23:23.111 --> 23:24.655
of finding where hab 1 is buried.

23:24.738 --> 23:28.534
All right. We can't just go digging up
random holes, hoping to hit pay dirt.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.663
You guys mapped out
all the lava tubes around here.

23:32.746 --> 23:35.165
That means you've got
ground-penetrating radar, correct?

23:35.249 --> 23:36.917
Of course we've got GPR.
We're not assholes.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.754
Good. Can you figure out a way
to hook it up to one of the rovers?

23:40.838 --> 23:42.339
-I can.
-Okay.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.425
We can cover the search area
in a grid pattern.

23:45.509 --> 23:46.718
UHF radio is back online.

23:46.802 --> 23:48.846
-We're good to go.
-Good.

23:48.929 --> 23:52.933
Kelly, Alexei, Phoenix will guide you
to this point in the rover,

23:53.016 --> 23:56.353
where you will execute
a square-out GPR search from there.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.522
Take your time. Be accurate.

23:59.565 --> 24:03.151
Kel, you can't let your emotions
get the best of you out there.

24:03.235 --> 24:04.444
You gonna be okay?

24:05.320 --> 24:06.321
I can handle it.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.615
Okay then.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.742
Will, Rolan,

24:10.826 --> 24:13.537
I need you to gather up
all the soil-moving tools you can find

24:13.620 --> 24:14.955
aboard the other rover.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.583
We may need to dig a big hole. Very fast.

24:17.666 --> 24:19.084
-Roger, skip.
-Will do.

24:23.172 --> 24:25.299
The NASA, Helios and Russian teams

24:25.382 --> 24:27.718
have joined forces
in the hunt for survivors,

24:27.801 --> 24:30.637
the former rivals united by the hope

24:30.721 --> 24:35.350
that astronauts Edward Baldwin
and Daniel Stevens may still be alive.

24:35.934 --> 24:39.021
They've narrowed their search
to this area here

24:39.104 --> 24:42.191
and have sent out
astronauts and cosmonauts

24:42.274 --> 24:46.612
with what's called ground-penetrating
radar to locate the buried habitat.

24:47.196 --> 24:50.699
Meanwhile, the world holds its breath.

24:50.782 --> 24:51.783
Stay tuned

24:51.867 --> 24:54.661
for more of our around-the-clock coverage
after this break.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.666
I remember when
my man was doubting himself.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.753
Then his doctor prescribed Stelebris Plus,

25:02.836 --> 25:05.797
the miraculous new medication
for the treatment of erec--

25:08.342 --> 25:12.054
My brother may die, and they're using
this time to sell dick pills.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.264
Unbelievable.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.770
Please tell me that's not your friends.
Not right now.

25:19.853 --> 25:22.231
I didn't invite them. I swear.

25:39.039 --> 25:41.416
Karen. Oh, my God.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.751
Can't believe you came.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.586
Of course. Where else would I be?

25:45.170 --> 25:48.173
Thank you.
I don't know if I can handle this.

25:48.257 --> 25:49.550
You can.

25:49.633 --> 25:51.343
You don't know it, but you can.

25:52.511 --> 25:54.012
Hi, Jimmy. How are you?

25:54.096 --> 25:55.806
You gonna tell us what's really going on?

25:57.057 --> 25:59.059
Well, there was a landslide.

25:59.142 --> 26:01.854
And it was probably brought
by the drilling on the ridge.

26:01.937 --> 26:02.938
I see.

26:03.981 --> 26:05.315
So you came all the way here

26:05.399 --> 26:08.485
to repeat some bull crap
they're spouting on television.

26:19.204 --> 26:22.040
It's bringing up a lot of old feelings
about his parents.

26:23.375 --> 26:27.421
But I'm sure he's secretly glad
you're here. I know I am.

26:29.173 --> 26:31.341
When was the last time you ate something?

26:32.926 --> 26:36.972
I don't know. Everything's a blur.
Um, this morning, I guess.

26:37.055 --> 26:40.893
Okay. So you lead the way to the kitchen.
'Cause we are gonna make some dinner.

26:40.976 --> 26:44.771
-Really? You sure you--
-Yes, I am sure.

26:44.855 --> 26:48.108
It is better than sitting in front
of that television, drowning in fear.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.068
Believe me.

27:09.546 --> 27:12.799
Another search leg down.
And still no sign of them.

27:28.857 --> 27:29.858
What is that?

27:31.610 --> 27:32.611
Aspirin.

27:35.405 --> 27:38.033
The landslide, it was very…

27:42.496 --> 27:44.039
I cannot lose this headache.

27:56.510 --> 27:57.761
What is wrong?

28:05.060 --> 28:06.186
I grew up with…

28:08.564 --> 28:11.066
this idea that he might die someday.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.613
It was just part of my life.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.160
I used to lie in bed at night
worrying about it.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.499
But now that the moment
may finally be here--

28:27.583 --> 28:30.794
We cannot think that way.

28:30.878 --> 28:32.087
I can't help it.

28:34.173 --> 28:36.300
The thought that he may be lying
in a dirt hole somewhere,

28:36.383 --> 28:39.261
that we may never even find his body.
I just…

28:54.026 --> 28:56.403
I was also very close with my father.

28:58.405 --> 29:00.115
He was pilot in Soviet air force.

29:00.199 --> 29:03.118
He was fascinated with space program.

29:03.744 --> 29:05.662
He even named me Alexei after…

29:06.413 --> 29:07.497
Leonov.

29:08.498 --> 29:10.626
And my sister, Anastasia.

29:19.176 --> 29:20.469
-Wait, stop!
-What?

29:20.552 --> 29:22.763
Possible beacon signal. Very weak.

29:31.730 --> 29:32.731
Is it…

29:42.074 --> 29:43.075
It is them.

29:46.036 --> 29:47.037
We found them.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.580
Jesus.

29:52.543 --> 29:55.629
This is rover 1. We've located the hab.

29:55.712 --> 29:58.257
Sending you our coordinates.
Get here as fast as you can.

30:00.592 --> 30:04.179
So GPR places hab 1 here.

30:05.055 --> 30:07.015
Beneath 20 meters of debris flow.

30:07.766 --> 30:09.601
So the beacon signal was extremely weak,

30:09.685 --> 30:12.729
which one would expect from a radio
buried that far underneath the ground.

30:12.813 --> 30:16.900
But it wasn't crushed. So Baldwin
and Stevens may be alive inside.

30:16.984 --> 30:19.611
Affirmative. But it's night up there,

30:19.695 --> 30:22.739
and the temperatures
are down to negative 73 degrees.

30:22.823 --> 30:25.492
Work in that cold will not move quickly.

30:27.119 --> 30:29.496
Digging down 20 meters with hand tools…

30:30.998 --> 30:33.750
will take more time than Baldwin
and Stevens have left.

30:33.834 --> 30:36.587
We need to come up
with something better, people.

30:36.670 --> 30:39.673
Talk to your back rooms.
Do whatever you need to.

30:39.756 --> 30:41.383
Let's get on it.

30:53.478 --> 30:55.772
Where's-- Where's Dev?

30:57.733 --> 30:59.776
He said he needed some air.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.373
Do the Russians ever…

31:15.083 --> 31:16.168
say anything about Margo?

31:18.045 --> 31:20.714
Just that she's a ballbuster. Why?

31:21.757 --> 31:22.758
No reason.

31:33.769 --> 31:35.103
There you are.

31:37.272 --> 31:40.984
Feel free to join us anytime.

31:41.068 --> 31:44.446
We're only trying to come up with
a way to save your astronauts' lives.

31:44.530 --> 31:47.491
I think better when I'm not chained
to a conference table.

31:47.574 --> 31:48.951
It stifles the mind.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.830
My dad would've loved being in this room.

31:56.583 --> 31:59.169
NASA Mission Control.

32:02.214 --> 32:03.632
Talked about it his whole life.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.136
Right. He was an aerospace engineer.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.221
Yeah.

32:10.430 --> 32:13.016
My father was an engineer too.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.104
He mainly taught, over in Huntsville.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.569
It's quite a place to grow up, I'm sure.

32:25.112 --> 32:27.614
You couldn't throw a rock
without hitting a scientist.

32:29.992 --> 32:32.160
We moved around a lot.
My dad went from job to job.

32:32.244 --> 32:36.665
We wound up in Rockford, Illinois,
of all places.

32:37.416 --> 32:41.044
Rockford? Your dad worked for Kirkland?

32:41.128 --> 32:43.255
Building components for the Saturn V.

32:45.716 --> 32:47.259
It was the highlight of his life.

32:49.928 --> 32:54.349
Till Apollo 23 exploded on the pad.

33:13.076 --> 33:14.494
After the explosion,

33:15.746 --> 33:17.998
they replaced the whole Saturn V team.

33:19.249 --> 33:22.169
My dad lost his job, and he couldn't
find another one to save his life.

33:22.252 --> 33:25.255
Drove a taxi for a few years after that.

33:28.258 --> 33:29.801
Never really recovered.

33:33.722 --> 33:35.140
Passed away before I even…

33:36.808 --> 33:38.143
graduated college.

33:43.774 --> 33:44.816
I'm sorry.

33:49.154 --> 33:51.198
I tell the story
of how my dad came to this country

33:51.281 --> 33:55.118
with no money to his name and--
and how he achieved his dreams…

33:59.206 --> 34:00.916
but I leave out the rest.

34:01.792 --> 34:02.960
Why?

34:03.043 --> 34:06.505
People like to hear
about success in America.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.716
About rising up,
pulling yourself up from your bootstraps.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.176
They don't like to hear about

34:12.636 --> 34:13.846
failure.

34:24.063 --> 34:27.442
What you've accomplished
is incredible, Dev.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.322
I think your father would be proud.

34:37.202 --> 34:38.203
Was yours?

34:45.627 --> 34:47.254
I think he was.

34:48.255 --> 34:49.297
In his own way.

34:57.097 --> 35:00.642
We need to get back.
We're running out of time. You coming?

35:03.562 --> 35:06.148
Yeah. Soon.

35:33.509 --> 35:34.635
How is she?

35:34.718 --> 35:36.386
She was fine. She dropped right off.

35:37.179 --> 35:38.180
Thank God.

35:39.056 --> 35:42.309
She's been fussing a lot more.
I think she's picking up on my anxiety.

35:42.935 --> 35:44.269
She'll be okay.

35:46.438 --> 35:47.981
Didn't realize I was this hungry.

35:48.065 --> 35:49.274
That's good.

35:51.235 --> 35:52.736
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

36:09.336 --> 36:10.963
Sorry, I don't mean to cry.

36:11.046 --> 36:12.589
Hey. No, no, no, no, no.

36:12.673 --> 36:15.759
Hey. It's okay. Crying is good.

36:16.885 --> 36:19.680
It's better than pretending
like everything is okay.

36:22.015 --> 36:24.101
Thank you. For everything.

36:26.937 --> 36:27.938
May I?

36:34.611 --> 36:35.904
Hello? It's Karen Baldwin.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.450
Yes. She's here with me.

36:44.955 --> 36:45.956
Okay.

36:52.129 --> 36:54.506
Okay. That sounds encouraging.

36:56.216 --> 36:57.217
I will let them know.

36:57.801 --> 36:59.887
Thank you so much for calling.

37:02.306 --> 37:03.348
They located the hab.

37:04.224 --> 37:06.727
They haven't made any contact
with Ed or Danny yet.

37:06.810 --> 37:09.062
But they've locked on
to the emergency beacon.

37:09.855 --> 37:11.231
They're gonna dig it out.

37:11.315 --> 37:12.316
Oh, my God.

37:13.066 --> 37:14.067
-Oh, my God.
-It's good.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.528
-It's good.
-Yeah.

37:19.948 --> 37:21.533
Just have to stay hopeful, okay?

37:29.541 --> 37:31.001
They're on their way, Madam President.

37:31.084 --> 37:32.085
Thank you, John.

37:39.927 --> 37:40.928
Where have you been?

37:42.179 --> 37:43.514
You left town without telling anyone.

37:43.597 --> 37:45.182
No one had any idea
where the hell you were.

37:45.265 --> 37:46.850
Secret Service knew.

37:46.934 --> 37:48.101
You mind telling me?

37:50.437 --> 37:51.730
I went to see Pam.

37:56.318 --> 37:58.487
-Are you out of your mind?
-Close to it.

38:00.072 --> 38:01.740
How could you take a risk like that?

38:01.823 --> 38:02.824
What if someone leaks it?

38:02.908 --> 38:06.119
If the press finds out where you really
were when this all was happening,

38:06.203 --> 38:08.205
it'll be a complete catastrophe.

38:08.288 --> 38:12.209
So we're talking about
my lack of discretion now?

38:15.212 --> 38:17.798
Look, this situation on Mars
has grabbed the spotlight.

38:18.340 --> 38:20.843
By the time it's over, my situation is--

38:20.926 --> 38:23.637
Are you actually suggesting I take comfort

38:24.137 --> 38:26.640
from a disaster
that might have killed four people?

38:26.723 --> 38:27.724
Of course not.

38:27.808 --> 38:29.351
Then what are you saying?

38:30.727 --> 38:31.728
I…

38:33.647 --> 38:34.648
I don't know.

38:43.115 --> 38:45.075
The vice president
and Administrator Truly are here.

38:46.076 --> 38:47.077
Send them in.

38:51.915 --> 38:54.084
-Madam President.
-Jim, Richard,

38:54.168 --> 38:56.211
thank you for coming on such short notice.

38:57.337 --> 39:00.340
Larry, would you mind giving us the room?

39:02.968 --> 39:03.969
Of course.

39:08.473 --> 39:11.518
Madam President, I just got
off the phone with Margo Madison.

39:12.186 --> 39:14.271
Our other drill is still aboard Phoenix.

39:14.354 --> 39:16.940
-It's not an option.
-Why didn't you bring it down?

39:17.024 --> 39:19.234
We had to focus on the fuel factory.

39:19.735 --> 39:22.070
We had to make sure
we could get Phoenix back home.

39:22.154 --> 39:23.697
Lots of good that's doing you now.

39:23.780 --> 39:24.781
Well…

39:29.494 --> 39:30.871
We go up.

39:30.954 --> 39:31.955
Up?

39:32.623 --> 39:34.124
We're looking in the wrong direction.

39:38.712 --> 39:40.464
All right. As we all know,

39:40.547 --> 39:43.133
hab 1 is under 20 meters
of granular debris flow.

39:43.217 --> 39:45.677
A rescue attempt from above
will never get to them in time.

39:45.761 --> 39:46.762
But…

39:47.971 --> 39:51.141
hab 1 also sits above a lava tube.

39:52.267 --> 39:55.938
If we enter the lava tube
where it's closest to the surface,

39:56.021 --> 39:58.982
which GPR places
three meters below the debris field,

39:59.483 --> 40:01.401
traverse that tube

40:02.653 --> 40:04.988
until we're just downstream with the hab,

40:06.698 --> 40:09.117
blow a hole in the tube roof,

40:09.201 --> 40:13.121
enough of the material above
will flow down from the hab

40:13.205 --> 40:14.665
through the hole,

40:15.249 --> 40:18.836
into the lava tube
like grain from a hopper.

40:19.586 --> 40:22.881
After it's cleared out,
the hab will be exposed.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.676
And we can access it from above.

40:27.761 --> 40:30.848
Are you suggesting
that we set off a bomb near the hab?

40:31.515 --> 40:33.100
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.

40:33.851 --> 40:35.561
The stress of explosion could destroy it.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.896
There are too many unknowns.

40:37.980 --> 40:40.524
If we place the charge incorrectly,
we could blow up the hab.

40:40.607 --> 40:42.484
And the people in it.

40:42.568 --> 40:45.696
But he's right.
If we dig down, we will certainly fail.

40:45.779 --> 40:47.322
And Baldwin and Stevens die.

40:48.156 --> 40:51.368
Well, we have coring drills
and explosives on site.

40:52.369 --> 40:53.537
It is doable.

40:54.955 --> 40:57.416
But if we miscalculate by even one meter…

40:57.499 --> 41:00.669
These are engineering problems,
my friends.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.173
And we are engineers.

41:06.049 --> 41:07.050
Shall we begin?

41:12.723 --> 41:16.059
Okay. Let's overlay the InSAR data
with the GPR survey.

41:23.192 --> 41:27.196
PpCO2 is over 20, which means our
carbon dioxide scrubbers are maxed out.

41:27.863 --> 41:29.114
It's about to get rough.

41:29.198 --> 41:30.199
Great.

41:33.410 --> 41:37.289
It's cold,
but it's gonna get a damn sight colder.

41:38.999 --> 41:40.876
Pretty soon,
we have to put our suits back on.

41:42.711 --> 41:45.255
So I can live a few more hours
and die a horrible death?

41:45.756 --> 41:46.757
No, thanks.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.592
Well, then you'll die from hypothermia.

41:50.761 --> 41:52.471
They say freezing's a good way to go.

41:53.639 --> 41:55.057
It's just like falling asleep.

41:57.518 --> 42:00.354
You're getting into one of those suits
if I have to stuff you in it myself.

42:00.437 --> 42:02.022
With that hole in your belly?

42:04.608 --> 42:06.276
You're in no shape to make me do anything.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.153
You're nothing but a goddamned quitter.

42:11.323 --> 42:12.574
-A quitter?
-Yeah.

42:12.658 --> 42:13.659
You serious?

42:14.660 --> 42:17.454
When I was wounded in Korea,
I spent some time in a MASH unit.

42:17.538 --> 42:18.580
And I saw firsthand

42:18.664 --> 42:22.751
the people that lost hope,
they were the first to die, Danny.

42:22.835 --> 42:25.045
Maybe they lost hope
because they knew they were gonna die.

42:25.128 --> 42:26.755
They died because they gave up!

42:26.839 --> 42:28.674
Give me a break, Ed.

42:30.676 --> 42:32.511
You're not teaching me how to ride a bike.

42:32.594 --> 42:35.264
Ride a bike?
What the hell are you talking about?

42:36.682 --> 42:39.393
Shane told me
all about your bike-riding lessons.

42:40.394 --> 42:41.895
Told me he was terrified of you.

42:42.604 --> 42:43.605
What?

42:43.689 --> 42:46.817
Whenever we got in trouble,
Shane used to beg Karen not to tell you.

42:48.902 --> 42:51.655
'Cause he knew when you'd find out,
he'd get so afraid.

42:51.738 --> 42:53.448
-And when you were away…
-That's enough.

42:53.532 --> 42:56.493
…or on orbit or on the moon,
Shane came to life.

42:56.577 --> 42:59.121
Laughing, goofing around.

42:59.204 --> 43:02.332
When you came home, he'd withdraw again
because he was so scared of you.

43:02.416 --> 43:03.500
Hey, you shut up!

43:03.584 --> 43:07.004
What kind of man gets off
on terrifying a little boy?

43:07.087 --> 43:08.088
His own son.

43:19.141 --> 43:21.894
Oh, shit. Don't move, Ed.

43:24.688 --> 43:26.273
Med kit. Med kit.

43:26.857 --> 43:27.858
-QuikClot.
-Okay.

43:33.155 --> 43:34.239
-Pour it in.
-Yeah.

43:45.167 --> 43:46.585
More, more. More, more, more, more.

43:49.630 --> 43:51.215
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

43:55.969 --> 43:57.012
Oh, shit.

44:11.276 --> 44:13.278
Okay, so let me understand.

44:13.362 --> 44:16.740
The idea is for a team to rappel down
into that lava tube,

44:16.823 --> 44:19.493
walk 700 meters in their suits,

44:19.993 --> 44:21.703
drill a hole in the rock roof,

44:21.787 --> 44:23.247
pack it with explosives

44:24.039 --> 44:25.457
and run like hell.

44:26.834 --> 44:29.336
Which poor bastards
are you gonna get to do that?

44:32.506 --> 44:33.757
You had to ask?

44:33.841 --> 44:35.759
You must be precise.

44:36.468 --> 44:38.637
Any error in placement
will destroy the hab.

44:39.221 --> 44:40.514
And us with it.

44:41.056 --> 44:45.435
Look, if you two don't think
you can handle it, I'll do it myself.

44:45.936 --> 44:48.063
You don't know jack
about explosives, skip.

44:48.939 --> 44:50.899
Last thing we need
is for you to blow yourself up.

44:51.942 --> 44:54.111
-I'll get the drill.
-Yep.

45:11.378 --> 45:12.504
There you are.

45:14.464 --> 45:16.049
Aren't you chilly out here?

45:16.758 --> 45:17.759
I'm fine.

45:18.635 --> 45:20.846
I can get you a coat if you want one.

45:20.929 --> 45:22.181
I don't want anything.

45:23.056 --> 45:24.057
Okay.

45:32.274 --> 45:33.984
I know about you and Danny.

45:39.740 --> 45:41.116
I'm sorry, I don't…

45:43.035 --> 45:44.912
I don't know what you're talking about.

45:44.995 --> 45:46.538
Do him the favor of being honest.

45:47.998 --> 45:49.249
Especially now.

46:23.742 --> 46:24.743
Okay.

46:31.124 --> 46:32.376
Why'd you do it?

46:39.925 --> 46:41.176
I was angry.

46:44.263 --> 46:45.389
At my husband,

46:46.974 --> 46:49.393
at the space program, at myself.

46:52.396 --> 46:53.689
I guess I just…

46:55.482 --> 46:57.985
I wanted to do something that was wrong.

47:03.282 --> 47:04.825
But why Danny?

47:13.166 --> 47:14.585
Because I trusted him.

47:16.253 --> 47:17.254
No.

47:20.299 --> 47:21.550
You used him.

47:25.971 --> 47:27.723
Just like everybody else.

47:34.229 --> 47:35.230
Maybe.

47:37.566 --> 47:38.650
Maybe I did.

47:45.699 --> 47:50.120
He always tried to live up to what
everyone else thought he should be.

47:54.124 --> 47:55.375
Our parents.

47:59.171 --> 48:01.256
Mr. Baldwin, Ms. Poole.

48:04.343 --> 48:06.011
Ever since he was a kid.

48:26.073 --> 48:27.282
I hate it.

48:32.037 --> 48:34.915
I hate it with every fiber of my being.

48:40.212 --> 48:41.964
I know that feeling.

48:46.301 --> 48:47.302
Yeah.

49:04.403 --> 49:06.321
Rover 1, hab 2.

49:06.405 --> 49:08.031
We are almost at your position.

49:08.740 --> 49:11.994
Copy, hab 2. Sight for sore eyes.

49:13.036 --> 49:14.371
Roger that, rover 1.

49:22.713 --> 49:24.798
-So, once we get inside, we'll--
-I--

49:24.882 --> 49:26.216
Alexei, what's wrong?

49:26.300 --> 49:27.593
I do not feel well.

49:28.552 --> 49:30.262
Let's get you inside.

49:35.934 --> 49:37.394
Oh, my God.

49:37.477 --> 49:38.729
What happened?

49:38.812 --> 49:41.690
He had a headache.
He was stumbling when we came up the ramp.

49:41.773 --> 49:43.775
But he got worse when we repressurized.

49:45.360 --> 49:46.361
Was he slurring words?

49:46.445 --> 49:48.280
-Off balance?
-A little bit.

49:48.363 --> 49:49.531
Help me get him on table.

49:52.201 --> 49:53.327
I got his head.

49:54.328 --> 49:55.746
What's wrong with him?

49:56.997 --> 49:58.749
I suspect subdural hematoma.

49:59.249 --> 50:01.627
I will have to drill a hole in his skull
to release the pressure.

50:01.710 --> 50:03.545
-Jesus.
-And I will need blood for transfusion.

50:03.629 --> 50:04.963
-A-positive.
-I'm A-positive.

50:05.047 --> 50:06.048
-Good. Mueller.
-Yes?

50:06.131 --> 50:07.341
Can you do a blood crossmatch?

50:07.424 --> 50:09.092
The analyzer can. I'll set it up.

50:18.894 --> 50:23.023
So I will be blood kin to a Baldwin.
Amazing.

50:36.453 --> 50:37.454
Okay.

50:37.538 --> 50:40.832
Explosive charges are set into the roof
of the lava tube.

50:45.003 --> 50:46.296
Rappelling back down.

50:48.632 --> 50:50.425
-Copy.
-Where are you?

50:51.343 --> 50:53.178
I'm down here.

50:53.262 --> 50:54.263
Doing what?

50:54.972 --> 50:56.557
Checking our position.

50:57.266 --> 50:59.017
We checked our position twice

50:59.101 --> 51:02.229
before we even drilled the hole
to set the explosives.

51:03.021 --> 51:04.481
Yeah, and I'm checking it again.

51:05.816 --> 51:08.110
We only got one shot at this.
Better make it count.

51:34.344 --> 51:35.470
Yeah. We're good.

51:35.554 --> 51:36.555
So…

51:39.808 --> 51:43.520
Hook it up, check detonator continuity,
and let's go.

51:50.569 --> 51:52.112
Ready to make a run for it?

51:53.155 --> 51:54.865
I'm not as young as you.

51:55.657 --> 51:57.576
I'll give you a head start, old man.

51:57.659 --> 51:59.828
Yeah, give me a break.

52:05.334 --> 52:06.335
Ed.

52:08.629 --> 52:09.922
Ed, listen to me.

52:12.257 --> 52:13.425
We're in a world of hurt.

52:17.971 --> 52:19.598
CO2 levels are up.

52:20.599 --> 52:22.267
It's starting to fuzz my brain.

52:23.435 --> 52:24.645
Look, you were right.

52:27.856 --> 52:29.399
We need to get into the suits.

52:30.609 --> 52:31.818
I'm gonna help you.

52:32.819 --> 52:34.154
No.

52:34.238 --> 52:35.239
Ed.

52:37.157 --> 52:38.158
We have to.

52:42.829 --> 52:44.665
It doesn't matter now.

52:45.749 --> 52:46.834
Yeah, what about Kelly?

52:48.919 --> 52:49.920
It matters to her.

52:53.298 --> 52:54.842
I fought with her.

52:59.263 --> 53:00.264
Before--

53:01.348 --> 53:03.350
Before we went up to the ridge.

53:04.852 --> 53:06.687
My last conversation with her…

53:08.689 --> 53:13.652
She was angry with me,
and I dismissed her.

53:14.403 --> 53:15.404
What?

53:17.155 --> 53:19.241
The last time I talked to Shane too.

53:21.577 --> 53:22.828
I yelled at him.

53:24.079 --> 53:26.290
Told him to be a man.

53:28.542 --> 53:29.960
Be a man.

53:31.503 --> 53:32.838
Be a man!

53:36.925 --> 53:39.469
Look, I shouldn't have said those things.
I was angry.

53:43.891 --> 53:44.975
Besides…

53:47.853 --> 53:49.688
you're not the only one
who sinned against Shane.

53:54.860 --> 53:57.112
You remember all the shit Shane and I did?

53:59.531 --> 54:04.369
Breaking water meters, blowing up toilets,
defacing school lockers.

54:09.416 --> 54:11.168
Everyone thought Shane was the ringleader.

54:15.672 --> 54:17.049
I let them think it.

54:21.178 --> 54:22.930
It was never his idea.

54:26.808 --> 54:27.809
It was always mine.

54:30.604 --> 54:32.314
I even taught him how to shoplift.

54:33.690 --> 54:35.442
Yeah, I dragged him into all of that.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.237
Let him take the heat when we got caught.

54:43.075 --> 54:45.035
And he forgave me every time.

54:47.788 --> 54:50.082
No matter how many times
I stabbed him in the back.

54:56.213 --> 54:58.423
I'm the reason
Karen grounded him that day.

55:01.134 --> 55:02.636
If he had never met me,

55:03.554 --> 55:05.973
Karen would have driven him
to that basketball game.

55:08.058 --> 55:10.310
He would have never
gotten hit by that car.

55:10.394 --> 55:13.522
He would have gone to Annapolis,
and he'd be here today instead of me.

55:20.320 --> 55:23.448
You know, I thought
if I lived the life that I took from him…

55:26.869 --> 55:28.120
the life he was meant to live,

55:28.203 --> 55:30.497
that it somehow might make up
for what I did.

55:37.129 --> 55:38.505
I fucked it up.

55:43.260 --> 55:46.722
Fucked it up like I fucked up everything
my whole life.

55:47.681 --> 55:48.682
Hey.

55:49.850 --> 55:51.643
Now I'm gonna leave Avery…

55:57.691 --> 56:00.152
like my mom and dad left me and Jimmy.

56:06.450 --> 56:08.869
-It's not worth it, Ed.
-Danny.

56:10.746 --> 56:12.748
-Danny.
-It's just not.

56:12.831 --> 56:14.750
Danny. Hey.

56:15.834 --> 56:18.086
Hey. It's okay.

56:19.588 --> 56:20.631
It's okay.

56:23.217 --> 56:24.551
It's okay.

56:28.972 --> 56:29.973
Ed.

56:39.691 --> 56:40.734
Ed, there's--

56:41.401 --> 56:43.487
Ed, there's something else
I need to tell you.

56:46.990 --> 56:47.991
Something--

57:16.603 --> 57:17.604
Hello?

57:18.689 --> 57:20.357
No. This is Karen Baldwin.

57:24.945 --> 57:25.946
Thank God.

57:27.781 --> 57:29.616
No, of course. I'll tell her. Thank you.

57:30.617 --> 57:31.618
Thank you.

57:32.786 --> 57:33.912
-They made it.
-Oh, my God!

57:33.996 --> 57:36.290
-They made it.
-Oh, my God.

57:36.373 --> 57:38.208
-They're okay.
-They're okay.

57:38.292 --> 57:39.459
They're okay.

57:45.841 --> 57:48.051
They're okay. Danny's alive.

57:56.852 --> 57:57.853
They're okay.

58:05.944 --> 58:07.487
They're okay.

59:01.834 --> 59:02.835
Hey.

59:07.214 --> 59:08.715
-Hey.
-Hey.

59:11.552 --> 59:12.636
Feel like shit?

59:15.639 --> 59:16.640
Good.

59:17.224 --> 59:18.600
That means you're alive.

59:22.145 --> 59:24.940
Surprising, considering
what Dimitri pulled out of you.

59:35.576 --> 59:36.910
Is Kelly okay?

59:36.994 --> 59:38.078
And Danny?

59:38.161 --> 59:39.329
Yeah.

59:42.583 --> 59:43.667
But…

59:46.336 --> 59:50.090
Ed, Alexei Poletov didn't make it.

59:52.426 --> 59:54.094
Neither did Isabel Castillo.

59:57.306 --> 59:58.515
Or Nick Corrado.

1:00:08.108 --> 1:00:09.109
Hey.

1:00:10.819 --> 1:00:12.487
Kelly.

1:00:20.037 --> 1:00:22.915
Honey. Honey.

1:00:25.792 --> 1:00:27.002
Honey.

1:00:28.712 --> 1:00:30.422
Honey. I'm so sorry.

1:00:34.218 --> 1:00:35.636
I'm so sorry.

1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:40.349
Honey. I'm so sorry.

1:00:42.309 --> 1:00:44.061
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1:00:56.698 --> 1:00:58.033
I'm so sorry.

1:02:17.112 --> 1:02:18.113
Dima.

1:02:20.991 --> 1:02:21.992
Dima.

1:02:28.415 --> 1:02:30.292
You did everything you could.

1:02:39.051 --> 1:02:41.303
What do we do about the Baldwin girl?

1:02:45.766 --> 1:02:49.019
Sooner or later,
she will find out that she is with child.

1:02:53.398 --> 1:02:55.359
We must tell Moscow first.

1:02:56.693 --> 1:02:58.028
And her commander…

1:02:58.987 --> 1:03:01.532
it puts the whole crew at risk.

1:03:01.615 --> 1:03:03.200
You understand, don't you?

1:03:04.076 --> 1:03:04.910
Yes?

1:03:05.994 --> 1:03:06.954
Yes.
