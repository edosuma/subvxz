00:01.060 --> 00:02.994
POTE: Previously,
on Queen of the South...

00:03.030 --> 00:04.895
You were driving the car

00:04.930 --> 00:07.694
tied to the murder
of my nephew Ren.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.332
It was not his fault!
He didn't do it.

00:09.370 --> 00:11.304
-LAFAYE'|'|'E: Who's "he"?
-EMILIA: My boyfriend.

00:11.340 --> 00:12.238
LAFAYE'I'I'E:
Your boyfriend happen

00:12.280 --> 00:14.635
to work with Teresa Mendoza?

00:14.680 --> 00:15.635
What are you
talking about, man?

00:15.680 --> 00:16.874
I blew her car up.

00:16.910 --> 00:18.070
She wasn't in the car, asshole.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.543
She's alive.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.172
Kill Teresa Mendoza,

00:21.220 --> 00:22.209
or I'll kill you.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.184
Nobody ever suspects
the nurse.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.211

Luis!

00:31.460 --> 00:33.758
(uneasy music)

00:33.800 --> 00:35.927
I still have every intention
of taking out Teresa.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.723
He tried to kill me
and my godson.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.021
You have to make your choice.

00:39.070 --> 00:41.061
I'm gonna kill El Gordo.

00:41.100 --> 00:46.003
*

00:46.040 --> 00:47.177
RANDALL:
Someone was definitely trying

00:47.210 --> 00:48.939
to send a message here.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.744
(gunfire)

00:51.780 --> 00:52.940
Get an ID on these two?

00:52.980 --> 00:54.277
COP:
Got a long rap sheet

00:54.320 --> 00:55.844
for narcotic trafficking
out of Miami.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.812
Elias hit the truck.

00:57.950 --> 00:58.939
CHICHO: The shipment's gone.

00:58.990 --> 01:00.855
We're going to kill them all.

01:00.890 --> 01:04.656

02:14.960 --> 02:16.325
Thank you.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.218
Gracias.

02:34.250 --> 02:39.256

02:50.430 --> 02:51.863
POTE:
Okay, we'll be in touch.

02:51.900 --> 02:55.859
*

02:55.900 --> 02:57.868
George already landed
in Miami.

02:57.910 --> 03:00.231
He's waiting on your word
to retaliate.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.078
We need to be sure
it was Elias.

03:03.110 --> 03:04.407
When you were in the hospital,

03:04.450 --> 03:06.839
Elias attacked
one of our shipments.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.177
It was for Oksana.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.211
Taking a shipment
is one thing.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.218
Killing Tony
and trying to kill me

03:13.260 --> 03:14.579
is completely different.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.724
Then who else
could it have been?

03:16.760 --> 03:18.978
Elias know
that we killed El Gordo.

03:19.030 --> 03:21.919
Oksana was involved
in his death.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.860
He didn't attack her.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.322
Not yet.

03:25.370 --> 03:27.588
I want the people
who killed Tony.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.734
We need proof
of who is responsible.

03:30.770 --> 03:33.102
If it was Elias,

03:33.140 --> 03:34.402
we're gonna kill him.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.908
Orale.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.872
Let's get the proof, then.

03:47.420 --> 03:51.379
Victor and his swamp rat
have scattered in the wind.

03:51.430 --> 03:55.025
He knew we would be
after him.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.062
How hard can it be

03:57.100 --> 04:01.036
_ to kill
one little MeXIcan woman?

04:01.070 --> 04:03.368
Unfortunately, Mendoza's men
grabbed the woman

04:03.410 --> 04:05.230
that Victor sent
to finish the job.

04:05.270 --> 04:09.639
There's a good chance
she'll know where he's hiding.

04:09.680 --> 04:13.138
If Mendoza gets to him
before you,

04:13.180 --> 04:15.978
she'll know
who ordered that bomb.

04:16.020 --> 04:17.317
Then I best find Victor.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.420
Hang on a second.

04:23.460 --> 04:26.349
Maybe we can kill two birds
with one stone here.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.094
If Miss Mendoza
wants vengeance,

04:34.140 --> 04:35.493
we'll help her get it.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.507

BOAZ: (speaking Spanish)

04:55.960 --> 04:57.621
And out of respect for you
and the way you run

04:57.660 --> 04:58.649
your business,

04:58.690 --> 05:00.419
I haven't used all my tools.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.826
*

05:02.870 --> 05:05.168
I'm only gonna ask you once.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.168
Who sent you to kill Teresa?

05:07.200 --> 05:12.206
*

05:17.880 --> 05:20.542
What are you gonna do,
shoot me?

05:20.580 --> 05:22.445

Nqum

05:26.220 --> 05:30.850
*

05:38.030 --> 05:39.839
They're Cajun mercenaries.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.394
They have their own militia.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.704
(speaking Spanish)

05:43.740 --> 05:45.833
She said she doesn't know
who hired them.

05:45.870 --> 05:47.576
Ah.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.975
At least she gave us
the location

05:49.010 --> 05:50.546
where Victor is hiding.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.912
He's the one
who planted the bomb.

05:52.950 --> 05:55.919
He has a stronghold
in Deadman's Bayou.

05:55.950 --> 05:58.145
Not even law enforcement
wrll go In there.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.452
I'm coming with you.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.783
(cell phone buzzes)

06:06.860 --> 06:07.849
-Yes?
-KELLY ANNE: You need

06:07.900 --> 06:09.390
to come home.

06:09.430 --> 06:10.419
What's wrong?

06:10.470 --> 06:11.721
We have company.

06:11.770 --> 06:14.159
(ominous music)

06:14.200 --> 06:15.132
(gasps)

06:17.610 --> 06:21.205
Hurry home now, and bring
Miss Mendoza with you.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.676
It's not polite
to keep company waiting.

06:24.710 --> 06:29.170
*

06:29.220 --> 06:31.415
Out of my way, cabrn.

06:31.450 --> 06:32.883
Don't make me ask again.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.514
You'd best call off your dog,
Miss Mendoza.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.255
Why would I do that?

06:37.290 --> 06:42.296
*

06:47.800 --> 06:50.200
This is not over.

06:50.240 --> 06:55.234
*

07:00.280 --> 07:03.647
You know, uh, this, uh--
this pozole

07:03.690 --> 07:07.148
is not half bad.

07:07.190 --> 07:08.384
Call me old-fashioned,

07:08.420 --> 07:11.548
but I still like
a woman who can cook.

07:11.590 --> 07:14.650
I didn't cook it.
He did.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.122

07:16.160 --> 07:17.263
LAFAYE'I'I'E:
Ooh.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.495
Well, now, that's surprising.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.292
What do you want?

07:21.340 --> 07:23.103
(clears throat)

07:23.140 --> 07:25.506
I know you're--
you're going after the people

07:25.540 --> 07:27.132
who killed your godson.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.068
And?

07:29.110 --> 07:30.748
You're entitled
to your vengeance,

07:30.780 --> 07:33.510
but around here,
people don't take too kindly

07:33.550 --> 07:35.973
to decapitated heads

07:36.020 --> 07:38.841
and bodies hanging
from bridges.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.687
That's not my plan.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.812
Well, maybe not, but, uh,

07:41.860 --> 07:44.920
those Cajuns you're hunting--

07:44.960 --> 07:46.928
they're a nasty bunch.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.451
How do you know
who they are?

07:49.500 --> 07:51.866
LAFAYE'I'I'E:
I saw the--the security footage

07:51.900 --> 07:53.868
at the hospital.

07:53.900 --> 07:57.028
A couple of your boys
dragging out at gunpoint

07:57.070 --> 08:00.779
a girlfriend
of a certain bomb-maker.

08:00.810 --> 08:03.142
So you know
who I'm looking for.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.102
Oh, I do,

08:05.150 --> 08:07.471
and that's why I'm going
to insist that Randall

08:07.520 --> 08:08.942
and his men
accompany you

08:08.980 --> 08:11.187
on your little
hunting expedition.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.812
I don't need your help.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.816
It's not a request.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.657
*

08:16.690 --> 08:18.351
You see,
I have a vested interest

08:18.390 --> 08:20.324
in your safety,
Miss Mendoza.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.157
*

08:22.200 --> 08:24.668
After all, we're partners.

*

08:35.180 --> 08:36.772
(engine turns over)

08:40.220 --> 08:41.972
Neither Victor nor Mendoza

08:42.020 --> 08:45.478
make it out of the bayou alive.
Understood?

08:45.520 --> 08:47.010
We'll get it done.

08:47.060 --> 08:52.054
*

08:56.230 --> 08:58.528
We found the house, patrona,
but we can't tell

08:58.570 --> 08:59.832
how many people
are in there.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.030
RANDALL: _
They got security,

09:01.070 --> 09:02.606
at least two of them.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.868
Armed.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.866
We should split up,

09:05.910 --> 09:08.708
box them in.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.844
We'll come from the west.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.745
Your people
should come from the south.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.941
I want Victor alive.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.845
We can take out the guards,

09:16.890 --> 09:19.450
then fire a warning shot,

09:19.490 --> 09:21.879
order Victor to come out.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.388
We'll wait for nightfall.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.783
Then we hit them.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.799
(uneasy music)

Got here just in time.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.938
I said I wanted him alive.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.528
I had no choice.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.003
He was gonna kill you.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.029
You jumped the gun, cabrn.

11:52.070 --> 11:53.503
You almost got Teresa killed.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.098
Well, swamp rats fired first.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.698
(speaks Spanish)
That's bullshit.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.547
Hey, I'm the one
that just saved your boss!

11:58.580 --> 12:01.242
I suggest you watch
your tone.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.248
Or what, cabrn, huh?
What?

12:04.450 --> 12:05.439
Let's go.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.737
(line trilling)

12:24.910 --> 12:27.071
Good news, I hope.

12:27.110 --> 12:28.805
RANDALL:
Not exactly.

12:28.840 --> 12:29.875
Victor's dead.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.104
Shot him before he could talk,

12:31.150 --> 12:34.540
but Teresa got away.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.468
How the hell
did that happen?

12:36.520 --> 12:37.942
RANDALL:
Her men were everywhere.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.788
Couldn't get a shot
without showing our hand.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.981
You said it had to be clean.

12:43.030 --> 12:46.079
Don't quote me
to cover your failure, boy.

12:46.130 --> 12:49.099
I give you one simple task
to complete,

12:49.130 --> 12:50.324
and you blew it.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.838
Now how the hell
you gonna fix It?

13:00.540 --> 13:02.804
Got an idea.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.999
I'll call you back.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.301
You better.

13:10.550 --> 13:12.108
(device beeps)

13:17.330 --> 13:18.627
Time for your pill.

13:18.660 --> 13:20.651

13:20.700 --> 13:21.951
I hope you're feeling better.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.661
*

13:23.700 --> 13:24.689
A day or two more,

13:24.730 --> 13:26.595
you'll be right as rain,
as my mother

13:26.630 --> 13:28.268
used to say.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.131
You gave us
quite a scare, son.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.365
*

13:32.410 --> 13:34.037
All that talk of

13:34.080 --> 13:35.877
a damsel in distress

13:35.910 --> 13:40.142
and murder on the bayou.

13:40.180 --> 13:43.616
Amazing, how the mind
can play tricks on us.

13:43.650 --> 13:49.885
*

13:49.930 --> 13:51.955
Your mother always said

13:51.990 --> 13:55.357
the...the nightmares
were the worst part

13:55.400 --> 13:58.062
of the disease.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.988
Pity you inherited
her weakness.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.634
*

14:02.670 --> 14:05.059
You know, you just--
you just rest now.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.078
You'll be up and about
in no time.

14:07.110 --> 14:12.104
*

14:32.100 --> 14:33.032
POTE:
This is him.

14:33.070 --> 14:36.039
(uneasy music)

14:36.070 --> 14:37.002
*

14:37.040 --> 14:38.928
Thank you.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.699
I'll make some arrangements.

14:40.740 --> 14:44.904
*

14:44.950 --> 14:47.874
It was the coroner's office.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.114
*

14:49.150 --> 14:51.289
Tony's remains
are ready for pickup.

14:51.320 --> 14:55.108
*

14:55.160 --> 14:56.787
He was a good boy.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.378
*

14:58.430 --> 15:00.421
Our relationship
was complicated,

15:00.460 --> 15:02.189
but I loved him
like he was my own.

15:02.230 --> 15:04.425
*

15:04.470 --> 15:06.267
And I failed him.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.961
*

15:08.000 --> 15:09.763
We both did.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.529
JAVIER:
Patrona.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.629
Randall is here.

15:13.680 --> 15:20.574
*

15:20.620 --> 15:21.871
(cries out)

15:21.920 --> 15:24.809
*

15:24.850 --> 15:26.738
What is this?

15:26.790 --> 15:28.655
Tell her
what you told me.

15:28.690 --> 15:32.319
*

15:32.360 --> 15:34.590
Spit it out.

15:34.630 --> 15:37.428
*

15:37.470 --> 15:41.133
The men who hired Victor
to plant the bombs

15:41.170 --> 15:42.933
were from Miami.

15:42.970 --> 15:46.269
*

15:46.310 --> 15:47.800
Cubans.

15:47.840 --> 15:51.003
*

15:51.050 --> 15:52.074
Get him out of here.

15:52.110 --> 15:55.011
*

15:55.050 --> 15:56.574
Uh, if I told them that,
you said you'd let me go.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.440
*

15:58.490 --> 16:00.253
You said you'd let me go!

16:00.290 --> 16:01.587
I'll take care of him.

16:01.620 --> 16:06.626
*

16:07.500 --> 16:08.592
Call George.

16:08.630 --> 16:11.360
*

16:11.400 --> 16:13.061
Tell him we're going
to Miami.

16:18.370 --> 16:21.032
(upbeat synth music)

16:21.080 --> 16:22.604
GEORGE:
(laughs)

16:22.640 --> 16:26.201
Well, aren't you a sight
for sore eyes?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.616
Welcome to Miami,
principessa.

16:28.650 --> 16:31.448
-George.
-(kisses)

16:31.490 --> 16:33.014
Thank you for being here.
I appreciate it.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.880
Sorry about Tony.

16:34.920 --> 16:35.887
Thank you.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.979
(laughs)

16:38.030 --> 16:39.281
(laughs) Oh!

16:39.330 --> 16:40.957
*

16:41.000 --> 16:43.161
Look at
the Justice League here!

16:43.200 --> 16:45.623
We got Chewy, Javi...

16:45.670 --> 16:47.297
Even the Wild Man
from Sinaloa.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.238
JAVIER: (speaks Spanish)
cabrn.

16:48.270 --> 16:49.669
BOAZ: Oh,
cabrn.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.236
GEORGE:
What's up, guapo?

16:51.270 --> 16:52.532
(laughs)
How's it going, George?

16:52.570 --> 16:54.504
GEORGE:
Hey.

16:54.540 --> 16:55.632
You ready for this?

16:55.680 --> 16:57.238
*

16:57.280 --> 16:58.201
We're family.

16:58.250 --> 17:03.244
*

17:03.290 --> 17:04.712
Let's do it.

17:04.750 --> 17:09.756
*

17:10.790 --> 17:12.155
Just got word
that Mendoza and her men

17:12.190 --> 17:13.555
are in Miami.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.558
(serene classical music
playing)

17:16.600 --> 17:18.818
Tying the attack
on her shipment

17:18.870 --> 17:20.667
to the bomb

17:20.700 --> 17:24.033
was a stroke of genius.

17:24.070 --> 17:28.837
If Mendoza thinks he_r enemies
are In MIamI,

17:28.880 --> 17:31.542
she'll follow that trail
right off the cliff.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.741
Ah, that's the hope, anyway.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.839
Hope's got nothing
to do with it.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.189
*

17:38.220 --> 17:41.348
Revenge is like blinders
on a horse.

17:41.390 --> 17:44.723
Keeps all the other avenues
hidden from view.

17:44.760 --> 17:45.852
*

17:45.890 --> 17:50.190
Still, Mendoza's a fighter.

17:50.230 --> 17:51.766
I wouldn't bet against her
in Miami.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.563
(ominous music)

17:53.600 --> 17:54.635
Well, then, maybe we need

17:54.670 --> 17:55.591
to hedge our bet.

17:55.640 --> 17:59.736
*

17:59.770 --> 18:00.930
(suspenseful music)

18:00.980 --> 18:03.448
POTE: So this
is where it all happens?

18:03.480 --> 18:04.572
A tanning salon?

18:04.610 --> 18:06.305
TERESA:
It's a cash business.

18:06.350 --> 18:07.271
It's a good cover.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.412
GEORGE:
Elias got a string

18:08.450 --> 18:11.044
of these places
where he washes dirty money.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.910
This here's a headquarters.

18:12.950 --> 18:13.985
He's got a back room

18:14.020 --> 18:15.749
where he processes
the coke.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.122
That's where we'll find
our stolen product.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.390
And if we're luclq, Elias.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.819
(speaks Spanish)

18:22.860 --> 18:24.760
GEORGE:
That's one of his drug mules.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.119
No one
ever suspects 'em.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.798
Beauty makes
for a great cover

18:28.840 --> 18:30.137
and distraction.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.899
And that's
the third distraction

18:31.940 --> 18:33.237
since we've been here.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.975
I'm liking this town
a lot more.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.307
Javier?

18:36.340 --> 18:38.069
Patrona.

18:38.110 --> 18:39.304
(speaking Spanish)

18:40.380 --> 18:41.608
Eh?

18:58.730 --> 19:00.698
We're not gonna hurt you.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.362
I just need to know
how it works.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.379
(pensive music)

19:08.410 --> 19:13.416
*

19:16.880 --> 19:18.438
I'm sorry.
Can I have your cell phone?

19:18.490 --> 19:19.946
I need to call
my boyfriend.

19:19.990 --> 19:22.311
*

19:22.360 --> 19:23.327
DAVIS:
Damn It.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.453
Oh, my God.

19:25.490 --> 19:28.220
The police?

19:28.260 --> 19:33.266
*

19:35.270 --> 19:37.909
(cell phone beeps)

19:37.940 --> 19:42.934
*

19:50.890 --> 19:52.187
(door clatters)

19:52.220 --> 19:53.881
(Latin pop music playing)

19:53.920 --> 19:55.182
Hola.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.517
How can I help you?

19:56.560 --> 19:58.926
We'd like to have
a sessmn, please.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.496
Separate rooms.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.895
(laughs)

20:01.930 --> 20:03.363
$60.

20:03.400 --> 20:10.329
*

20:10.370 --> 20:13.339
Okay, rooms four
and five.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.506
*

20:14.540 --> 20:15.939
Straight down that hall.

20:15.980 --> 20:16.901
Gracias.

20:16.940 --> 20:21.912
*

20:35.960 --> 20:36.892
(key clatters)

20:36.930 --> 20:40.297
*

20:40.340 --> 20:41.637
(speaks Spanish)

20:41.670 --> 20:46.300
*

21:07.430 --> 21:08.499
(line trilling)

21:08.530 --> 21:10.418
(cell phone buzzes)

21:10.470 --> 21:11.494
Yeah.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.599
POTE:
We're in position.

21:12.630 --> 21:13.767
*

21:13.800 --> 21:15.597
Down the hall.
Make a left.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.664
The blue door.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.567
(door squeaks)

21:19.610 --> 21:20.679
Hola.

21:20.710 --> 21:21.802
How can I help you?

21:21.840 --> 21:24.149
I'm here
for the South Beach Special.

21:24.180 --> 21:29.174
*

21:32.050 --> 21:33.119
Thank you.

21:33.150 --> 21:37.359
*

21:37.390 --> 21:39.483
(door squeaks)

21:39.530 --> 21:40.849
Hey, hey.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.821
Hola.

21:41.860 --> 21:43.589
You, uh, here for a tan?

21:43.630 --> 21:46.019
Let me ask you a question.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.492
Are the Speedos optional?

21:47.540 --> 21:52.534
*

21:53.170 --> 21:56.537
Bikini lines ruin
the aesthetics of my frame.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.878
See, I prefer to tan
au naturel,

21:58.910 --> 21:59.842
if you know what I mean.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.941
*

22:03.990 --> 22:06.140
-(attendant laughs)
-(cell phone buzzes)

22:06.190 --> 22:10.149
*

22:10.190 --> 22:12.522
Hands up, darling.
No, no.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.824
Don't touch
that panic button.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.829
(ominous music)

22:17.870 --> 22:22.864
*

22:29.040 --> 22:29.972
-(silenced gunshot)
-(groans)

22:30.010 --> 22:30.999
(woman screams)

22:31.050 --> 22:32.745
*

22:32.780 --> 22:34.008
(women quavering)

22:34.050 --> 22:36.769
*

22:44.390 --> 22:47.553
(gunshots)

22:47.600 --> 22:52.594
*

23:02.380 --> 23:04.245
(magazine clicking)

23:04.280 --> 23:05.440
He's reloading!

23:05.480 --> 23:07.516
*

23:07.550 --> 23:09.211
(quavers)

23:09.250 --> 23:11.343
Don't--don't shoot!

23:11.390 --> 23:13.858
-Elias! Elias!
-I'm Nacho! I'm--

23:13.890 --> 23:16.085
-No!
-Shut up!

23:16.120 --> 23:19.089
(Nacho gasping)

23:19.130 --> 23:20.529
I don't know who you are,

23:20.560 --> 23:22.949
but do you know
who you're messing with?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.468
My name is Teresa Mendoza.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.799
I'm the one who killed
El Gordo,

23:28.840 --> 23:31.104
and that is my cocaine
you're processing.

23:31.140 --> 23:35.031
*

23:35.080 --> 23:37.071
What do you want from me?

23:37.110 --> 23:39.442
Tell me where Elias is.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.141
*

23:41.180 --> 23:44.388
Don't worry.
He found you.

23:44.420 --> 23:49.414
*

23:54.830 --> 23:55.728
(automatic gunfire)

23:55.760 --> 23:56.897
(shotgun firing)

23:56.930 --> 23:59.569
(dramatic music)

23:59.600 --> 24:01.739
*

24:01.770 --> 24:03.169
Where's the back door?

24:03.200 --> 24:04.406
I don't--

24:04.440 --> 24:06.135
(sputters and yells)

24:06.170 --> 24:09.071
(distant gunfire)

24:09.110 --> 24:10.099
Chewy!

24:10.140 --> 24:11.448
We got company!

24:11.480 --> 24:13.744
*

24:13.780 --> 24:15.919
(automatic gunfire)

24:15.950 --> 24:17.076
(speaking Spanish)

24:17.120 --> 24:18.417
(speaking Spanish)
No, no, no, no, no.

24:18.450 --> 24:21.453
(gunfire continues)

24:21.490 --> 24:26.450
*

24:27.030 --> 24:28.122
GEORGE:
Come on, Javi.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.923
JAVIER:
Entra, Teresa.

24:29.960 --> 24:34.465
*

24:36.970 --> 24:38.961
Heads up, George!
George!

24:39.010 --> 24:41.979
(energetic synth music)

24:42.010 --> 24:43.602
*

24:43.650 --> 24:44.947
(engine sputters)

24:44.980 --> 24:48.211
(engine turns over)

24:48.250 --> 24:50.946
-(distant sirens wail)
-JAVIER: Entra, entra!

24:50.990 --> 24:55.689
*

24:55.720 --> 24:58.382
(sirens wailing)

24:58.430 --> 25:03.424
*

25:06.030 --> 25:09.363
Been a while since you, um...

25:09.400 --> 25:12.733
paid us a visit here.

25:12.770 --> 25:16.479
The affairs of our city
keep my dance card pretty full.

25:16.510 --> 25:19.001
I'm sure you understand.

25:19.050 --> 25:23.316
I remember the night
you opened this place, hmm?

25:23.350 --> 25:25.045
Ah, you put the town
on notice.

25:25.090 --> 25:28.355
There--_there was a new boss
In the quarter.

25:28.390 --> 25:30.153
It was a memorable night.

25:30.190 --> 25:32.329
To see you grow
from that little teenaged boy

25:32.360 --> 25:34.897
selling dime bags
on the corner

25:34.930 --> 25:38.525
to the powerful man
you've become--

25:38.570 --> 25:39.867
I like to think I had
a little something

25:39.900 --> 25:41.162
to do with that.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.168
(laughs)

25:43.200 --> 25:44.929
You rounded off some corners.

25:44.970 --> 25:47.268
(laughs)

25:47.310 --> 25:50.677
We had a good run, Marcel.

25:50.710 --> 25:52.200
Been through a lot together.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.844
I suspect this, uh, stroll
down Memory Lane

25:54.880 --> 25:58.043
is leading to a point.

25:58.090 --> 26:01.753
Teresa Mendoza--

26:01.790 --> 26:05.123
she's becoming a problem.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.889
Her people have bought
nothing but chaos

26:06.930 --> 26:08.192
and bloodshed.

26:08.230 --> 26:12.291
And a very sizeable source
of revenue.

26:12.330 --> 26:16.562
True, at a cost.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.067
But who am I telling?

26:18.110 --> 26:20.465
You know that
more than anyone

26:20.510 --> 26:22.273
after Bobby's murder.

26:25.310 --> 26:27.301
-We buried that hatchet.
-LAFAYE'|'|'E: Mm.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.379
Well, I want you
to unbury it.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.638
All due respect, Judge,

26:32.690 --> 26:35.989
I think that may be
a bit short-sighted.

26:36.020 --> 26:37.282
Mm.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.925
Mendoza has enemies.

26:39.960 --> 26:43.498
You protect her,
those enemies become yours.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.089
You mean you.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.632
I-I didn't think this would be

26:52.670 --> 26:55.002
such a challenge
for you, Marcel.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.501
After all, you people
have a history

26:59.550 --> 27:01.518
of killing each other.

27:01.550 --> 27:04.542
(dark music)

27:05.390 --> 27:08.450
When that levee breaks,

27:08.490 --> 27:11.084
I need to know
I can count on you.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.690
*

27:13.730 --> 27:14.651
Yeah.

27:14.700 --> 27:19.694
*

27:33.210 --> 27:35.110
(whispering in Spanish)

27:35.150 --> 27:37.015
Patrona, Boaz isn't
picking up.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.608
Pilot says he's ready.

27:38.650 --> 27:40.618
We shouldn't stay here
any longer, Teresita.

27:40.650 --> 27:42.982
Chewy's right.
We should call back to NOLA,

27:43.020 --> 27:44.885
regroup, come back
with an army,

27:44.930 --> 27:46.056
and finish this.

27:46.090 --> 27:47.159
We could take Nacho
with us.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.464
We're not leaving

27:51.500 --> 27:53.127
until we find Elias.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.434
(tires squealing)

27:59.070 --> 28:00.708
JAVIER: (speaking Spanish)
cabrn?

28:02.410 --> 28:03.638
I barely made it out.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.875
The others?

28:05.910 --> 28:07.741
They weren't so luclq.

28:07.780 --> 28:10.749
(dark music)

28:10.790 --> 28:15.352
*

28:18.960 --> 28:23.966
*

28:28.700 --> 28:31.601
Tell us where Elias is,

28:31.640 --> 28:34.177
or they will make you talk
the Sinaloa way.

28:34.210 --> 28:39.204
*

28:39.480 --> 28:42.449
(heavy modern music playing)

28:42.480 --> 28:45.449
(tense music)

28:45.490 --> 28:47.583
*

28:47.620 --> 28:48.712
Do it.

28:48.760 --> 28:53.754
*

28:56.060 --> 28:57.027
(line trilling)

28:57.060 --> 28:59.722
(cell phone buzzes)

28:59.770 --> 29:00.725
Nacho.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.267
NACHO: They tried to grab me,
but I got away.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.561
I got one of them
in my trunk.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.032
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

29:07.070 --> 29:08.332
What did you say?

29:09.740 --> 29:10.729
NACHO:
He's--he's in my trunk.

29:10.780 --> 29:11.769
He's alive?

29:13.350 --> 29:14.749
He's talking.

29:14.780 --> 29:16.372
ELIAS:
What did he say?

29:16.420 --> 29:17.785
He said
that they're hiding out

29:17.820 --> 29:20.380
in the old factory
off the interstate.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.115
*

29:22.160 --> 29:23.218
How many?

29:23.260 --> 29:24.727
NACHO:
Five, including her.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.819
*

29:26.860 --> 29:27.997
I'm sending Indio.

29:28.030 --> 29:29.827
Get your ass
to the house.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.589
Bring him to me.

29:31.630 --> 29:34.064
(scoffs)
I'm on my way.

29:34.100 --> 29:39.106
*

29:41.140 --> 29:44.473
They're at the factory
off the interstate.

29:44.510 --> 29:45.807
Take everyone.

29:45.850 --> 29:48.614
I want that puta
and her people dead.

29:48.650 --> 29:50.117
Dead!

29:50.150 --> 29:51.947
(dramatic music)

29:56.860 --> 29:59.522
(suspenseful music)

30:05.470 --> 30:06.960
(line trilling)

30:07.000 --> 30:09.264
TERESA:
Elias' men are on their way.

30:09.300 --> 30:10.494
We'll be ready.

30:10.540 --> 30:11.859
*

30:11.910 --> 30:12.831
They're coming.

30:12.870 --> 30:13.973
Well, we'll be ready
for them.

30:14.010 --> 30:15.477
Let's give them hell.

30:15.510 --> 30:17.944

(groans)

30:53.010 --> 30:58.016

Whew.

31:03.460 --> 31:05.052

32:24.870 --> 32:27.168
(cell phone buzzes)

32:27.210 --> 32:28.734
Speak.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.805
POTE:
Your men are dead, cabrn.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.944
(laughs)

32:32.980 --> 32:34.311
Hear me, pendejo.

32:34.350 --> 32:35.669
I'm gonna find you.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.449
You know what I'ma do?
Mm?

32:37.480 --> 32:39.641
POTE:
Turn around.

(tense music)

32:42.690 --> 32:47.684
*

32:48.660 --> 32:51.128
You killed my godson.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.297
*

32:53.330 --> 32:55.036
You got it wrong.

32:55.070 --> 32:56.992
I didn't kill him.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.337
But you killed my uncle.

32:58.370 --> 32:59.462
*

32:59.510 --> 33:01.000
I don't believe you.

33:01.040 --> 33:05.306
*

33:07.650 --> 33:09.117
(laughs) You're gonna kill me
either way, right?

33:09.150 --> 33:11.118
*

33:11.150 --> 33:13.789
So you know what?

33:13.820 --> 33:15.549
I didn't kill him...

33:15.590 --> 33:18.127
*

33:18.160 --> 33:20.481
But now I wish I had.

33:20.530 --> 33:21.519
He would've suffered.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.891
It wouldn't be quick, either.

33:22.930 --> 33:24.727
(gunshot)

33:24.770 --> 33:26.123
*

33:26.170 --> 33:27.068
POTE:
It's done.

33:27.100 --> 33:32.106
*

33:34.780 --> 33:36.236
(doorbell rings)

33:38.410 --> 33:41.379

33:50.020 --> 33:51.681
(laughs)

33:51.730 --> 33:54.051
You starting early, I see.

33:57.060 --> 33:59.096
(laughs)

33:59.130 --> 34:02.236
*

34:02.270 --> 34:03.362
Good to see you, Marcel.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.606
Lucien.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.062
Thanks for seeing me.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.259
Have a seat.

34:07.310 --> 34:12.270
*

34:12.310 --> 34:13.345
He takes it neat.

34:13.380 --> 34:14.745
*

34:14.780 --> 34:16.008
That looks good.

34:16.050 --> 34:18.848
*

34:18.890 --> 34:20.187
So I know you didn't come
out here

34:20.220 --> 34:21.756
just to sample
my fine whiskey.

34:21.790 --> 34:26.227
*

34:26.260 --> 34:28.524
Judge paid me a visit.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.791
*

34:31.830 --> 34:33.092
Who is it?

34:33.130 --> 34:37.191
*

34:37.240 --> 34:38.935
It's Mendoza.

34:38.970 --> 34:41.063
*

34:41.110 --> 34:42.202
What you gonna do?

34:42.240 --> 34:44.549
I'm weighing my options.

34:44.580 --> 34:47.947
Options?

34:47.980 --> 34:49.914
We've been living
under the thumb of that man

34:49.950 --> 34:51.542
and his family

34:51.590 --> 34:52.887
for generations.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.251
There's a reason why.

34:54.290 --> 34:55.587
I know.

34:55.620 --> 34:58.384
This woman is a major player.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.328
I'm telling you--

34:59.360 --> 35:01.089
You ain't telling me nothing.

35:01.130 --> 35:05.226
*

35:05.270 --> 35:07.989
You think you special
all of a sudden?

35:08.030 --> 35:09.065
After all these years,

35:09.100 --> 35:10.397
you're just gonna topple
thejudge?

35:10.440 --> 35:13.739
I know I can't do it
by myself, LUCIen!

35:13.770 --> 35:16.477
Together, with her,

35:16.510 --> 35:18.239
we got a shot.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.498
*

35:20.550 --> 35:23.018
I thought I taught you
better than that, boy.

35:23.050 --> 35:24.847
You forgot what you are?

35:24.890 --> 35:28.519
Judge Lafayette and his kind
always win.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.017
Shit, it's been like this
since time immemorial.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.618
Ain't nothing
ever gonna change, ever,

35:32.660 --> 35:34.025
so get that shit
out of your head.

35:34.060 --> 35:39.020
*

35:43.140 --> 35:46.803
Listen, son,
I understand the desire.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.331
When I was in your shoes,
I wanted to make a move.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.541
Shit, I could've burned
this whole town down.

35:51.580 --> 35:53.878
*

35:53.910 --> 35:56.049
But you know what saved me?

35:56.080 --> 35:58.844
I remembered where I was.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.609
*

36:01.660 --> 36:02.979
You'd do well
to do the same.

36:03.020 --> 36:07.684
*

36:07.730 --> 36:09.027
Hello?

36:10.230 --> 36:13.199
(melancholy music)

36:13.230 --> 36:16.768
*

36:19.040 --> 36:22.578
*

36:22.610 --> 36:25.170
Emilia's not here,

36:25.210 --> 36:26.643
but I know where to find her.

36:26.680 --> 36:31.686
*

36:43.560 --> 36:45.425
It's done.

36:45.470 --> 36:47.199
Got your vengeance.

36:47.230 --> 36:50.199
Tony can rest in peace.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.162
Not yet.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.737
Elias didn't kill Tony.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.701
What are you talking about?

36:56.740 --> 37:00.198
I looked into his eyes.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.547
He was telling the truth.

37:01.580 --> 37:04.447
*

37:04.490 --> 37:06.242
Well, if not Elias, then who?

37:06.290 --> 37:08.178
*

37:08.220 --> 37:10.188
I don't know.

37:10.220 --> 37:13.280
But I'm gonna find out.

37:13.330 --> 37:16.094
Speaking of vengeance,

37:16.130 --> 37:19.566
I never got to ask you
about Birdie.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.137
*

37:22.170 --> 37:25.264
I don't need details.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.131
I just need to know
that she was properly avenged.

37:28.170 --> 37:30.900
(door opens)

37:30.940 --> 37:33.875
(footsteps approaching)

37:33.910 --> 37:36.549
*

37:36.580 --> 37:38.389
They're all here.

37:38.420 --> 37:43.414
*

37:45.160 --> 37:46.457
Thank you all for coming.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.958
*

37:49.000 --> 37:51.719
As you know,
Elias is dead.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.590
Anyone who bought from him

37:53.630 --> 37:54.961
can now buy from me.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.491
There are plenty of suppliers
in Miami.

37:57.540 --> 37:58.837
Why should we buy from you?

37:58.870 --> 38:02.909
El Gordo stepped
on the product he sold you.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.669
His profits went up,

38:04.710 --> 38:06.598
but the quality went down.

38:06.650 --> 38:08.618
Now that he's gone,

38:08.650 --> 38:10.515
no more middleman.

38:10.550 --> 38:13.587
If you buy from me,
you'll get pure cocaine

38:13.620 --> 38:17.579
at wholesale prices.
Everyone wins.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.986
Generous deal.
What's the catch?

38:20.030 --> 38:22.123
No catch,

38:22.160 --> 38:24.253
but if you walk away,

38:24.300 --> 38:27.098
you will not be a customer.

38:27.130 --> 38:29.462
You will be a competitor.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.036
(synth music)

38:31.070 --> 38:33.766
You hold up your end,
we'll hold up ours.

38:33.810 --> 38:36.699
*

38:36.740 --> 38:38.674
I look forward
to working with you all.

38:38.710 --> 38:43.716
*

38:44.720 --> 38:45.709
JAVIER:
Patrona.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.638
*

38:49.820 --> 38:52.789
(tense crescendo music)

38:52.830 --> 38:56.288
*

38:56.330 --> 38:58.093
Would you like a job?

39:00.930 --> 39:02.488
You start tomorrow.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.606
Gracias.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.877
How do you feel
about Miami?

39:09.910 --> 39:14.006
Weather, women...
what's not to like?

39:14.050 --> 39:15.347
Good.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.109
I'd like you to run it.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.215
You won't regret it, jefa.

39:21.250 --> 39:24.219
(dance music)

39:24.260 --> 39:29.254
*

39:44.580 --> 39:46.400
POTE: Are you sure
you want to give Boaz

39:46.450 --> 39:48.247
the keys to all this?

39:48.280 --> 39:50.373
TERESA:
People don't know us here.

39:50.420 --> 39:52.183
If anyone steps out of line,

39:52.220 --> 39:53.346
he'll send the right message.

39:53.390 --> 39:54.414
*

39:54.460 --> 39:55.859
You trust him now?

39:55.890 --> 39:58.859
No, but here,
we can keep an eye on him,

39:58.890 --> 40:00.778
and send someone else
to SInaloa.

40:00.830 --> 40:03.048
*

40:03.100 --> 40:05.489
(cell phone buzzes)

40:06.300 --> 40:07.369
Marcel.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.392
Judge came by my--

40:10.440 --> 40:12.465
my office today.

40:12.510 --> 40:14.603
He's making a move
against you.

40:14.640 --> 40:17.768
Ijust paid him $30 million.

40:17.810 --> 40:19.778
Why would he make a move
against me?

40:19.810 --> 40:21.243
DUMAS:
I don't know, but listen.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.771
Teresa, he wants you dead.

40:23.820 --> 40:26.209
Okay?
In the ground.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.138
(ominous music)

40:28.190 --> 40:29.612
I just want you to know.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.218
*

40:31.260 --> 40:32.659
I'm all in.

40:32.690 --> 40:33.657
*

40:33.690 --> 40:34.896
Thank you.

40:34.930 --> 40:37.956
Yeah.
You get back safe.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.319
I'll be here.

40:39.370 --> 40:44.364
*

40:46.110 --> 40:47.759
Lafayette killed Tony.

40:47.810 --> 40:51.906
*

40:51.950 --> 40:52.905
Puta madre.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.669
*

40:55.720 --> 40:59.508
We pay him a lot of money.
Why would he do that?

40:59.550 --> 41:01.654
It must be personal.

41:01.690 --> 41:04.989
He's coming for us.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.349
How you want to handle this?

41:06.390 --> 41:08.278
He owns New Orleans,
Teresita.

41:08.330 --> 41:09.297
If we kill him,

41:09.330 --> 41:10.490
they'll come after us

41:10.530 --> 41:11.929
with everything.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.289
Police, locals.

41:14.470 --> 41:17.860
We cannot come back
from that.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.368
I know.

41:20.410 --> 41:23.868
Orale, then.
Pues we burn it all.

41:23.910 --> 41:27.676
*

41:28.250 --> 41:29.808
This is my town.

41:29.850 --> 41:34.856
*

41:55.280 --> 41:56.235
(projector clicking)

41:56.280 --> 41:59.249
(keys clacking, bell dings)

41:59.280 --> 42:01.271
(high clear music)
