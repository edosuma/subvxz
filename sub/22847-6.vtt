00:01.210 --> 00:03.337
<i>Previously
on</i> Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:05.715 --> 00:07.925
May, your leg.
You're still not 100 percent.

00:08.426 --> 00:11.345
There's no way I can tell for certain
if you're being honest.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.889
- But he can.
- It's just me and Simmons.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.850
They're telling the truth. Both of them.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.184
<i>I covered for you.</i>

00:17.351 --> 00:18.978
You can let other people read
your mind, too?

00:19.145 --> 00:20.938
- Yeah.
<i>- It's a Cryo-Freeze Chamber.</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:23.149
<i>I'm taking the long way there.</i>

00:23.816 --> 00:26.277
While you were asleep,
I had time to put a plan in motion.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.404
With the price I'll fetch for you,

00:28.821 --> 00:32.825
I'll finally have the means to leave
this horrendous place once and for all.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.535
<i>She's the Destroyer of Worlds.</i>

00:37.371 --> 00:38.873
She should fight to the death.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.157
Gonna have to do.

01:20.873 --> 01:21.957
Hey, Gretch!

01:23.793 --> 01:25.002
Got your tin right here.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.254
I'll give you a token.

01:28.214 --> 01:29.215
A token?

01:30.007 --> 01:32.927
- I was hoping for at least three.
- Token's all I can spare.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.305
Only for my favourite customer.

01:41.644 --> 01:45.481
Hey, Citrus, look, I don't have enough
today, but maybe tomorrow, you can...

01:50.111 --> 01:54.490
- Sorry, junior. No gimmies today.
- Look, I don't need charity, all right?

01:56.367 --> 01:57.535
Only your best offer.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.123
Hmm.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.640
We've been looking for you.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.810
Kasius is breeding Inhumans
to sell.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.896
Guy's got his own Cronenberg
science division and everything.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.731
This would explain all the ships arriving.

02:28.107 --> 02:30.025
- You think they're here for Daisy?
- Afraid so.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.485
And still no sign of May?

02:31.819 --> 02:33.529
Normally, she could hold her own
against the Kree.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.906
But her leg... It's in bad shape.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.617
- There you are.
- Tess?

02:39.410 --> 02:41.370
- What is it?
- It's the Blues.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.665
They've come to harvest the children.

02:58.179 --> 03:02.099
That is Lady Karaba.
She is a demented brute.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.226
Her affection a curse to anyone
who receives it.

03:06.270 --> 03:10.274
And there is Senator Gaius Ponarian.
I am...

03:11.150 --> 03:13.819
repulsed by the sight.
Even the man's closest friends

03:13.986 --> 03:17.781
find his temperament to be
that of a diseased child monster.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.869
Seems Kasius has assembled
the worst of the worst.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.454
Do not fear.

03:24.622 --> 03:28.250
You are far more reprehensible
than any other creature in this room.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.003
- Thanks for that, Enoch.
- You're quite welcome.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.590
It was a rather fun pursuit,
constructing your alias.

03:35.257 --> 03:39.220
No longer are you Leopold Fitz,
but instead, Boshtok,

03:39.678 --> 03:42.556
a vile space Marauder of unlimited wealth.

03:43.349 --> 03:46.101
- Was the brooch really necessary?
- Indeed.

03:46.477 --> 03:49.188
That medal signifies the number
of enemy lives you've taken.

03:50.648 --> 03:51.649
Just...

03:52.358 --> 03:55.110
seems a little odd wearing a medal
with little rhinestones on it.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.363
That is quite amusing.

03:57.780 --> 04:00.241
You no doubt realise
those are Geg-ku larvae.

04:02.076 --> 04:06.247
Okay, you know what?
Let's drop the charade, find the others,

04:07.331 --> 04:08.582
and we'll shoot our way out.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.251
Mm.

04:10.417 --> 04:13.504
The chances of survival would be less
than two percent for each individual.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.012
That is Jemma Simmons.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.431
Would you like me to broker
an introduction?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.770
Why would I need you to introduce me
to Jemma Simmons?

04:30.104 --> 04:31.397
It's Marauder protocol.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.317
Ah, Marauder.

04:36.527 --> 04:37.945
Look at the snivelling horde.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.031
These same ingrates mocked me
all these years,

04:41.198 --> 04:45.577
yet, now they hover about,
clamouring for my favour.

04:51.292 --> 04:56.880
I, too, am unfamiliar with the Marauder,
though his fortune is rumoured to be vast.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.469
You want me to keep an eye on him.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.642
Ponarian...

05:09.727 --> 05:12.354
- how great to see you again, dear friend.
- Kasius.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.899
Pleasure to be here, as always.
Thank you for your hospitality.

05:16.442 --> 05:17.735
Thank you for coming all this way...

05:29.246 --> 05:30.956
Jemma, it's me. Don't turn around.

05:32.583 --> 05:33.751
Just play it cool.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.048
I've missed you so much.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.718
You know, I spent six months locked up
in an off-the-books military prison,

05:42.885 --> 05:46.138
not to mention 80 years frozen in space,
all just hoping to find you...

05:48.515 --> 05:49.683
and here you are.

05:58.776 --> 06:00.152
You know, I realised something.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.033
The universe can't stop us.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.370
'Cause we've crossed galaxies.
We've travelled through time.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.039
We've survived the bottom of the Atlantic
just so we could be together.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.417
Now, a love like that.
That's stronger than any curse.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.421
And you and I,
we are unstoppable together.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.759
I...

06:25.844 --> 06:27.763
I don't want to live another day
without you.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.107
So, Jemma Simmons, will you marry me?

06:46.657 --> 06:48.158
I know. I mean, I know I said,
"Play it cool,"

06:48.242 --> 06:50.160
but I didn't mean play it this cool.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.665
Jemma.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.500
Is there a problem?

07:04.925 --> 07:08.262
I asked your servant a question
which she ignored.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.390
My apologies.
My servitors are only allowed

07:11.557 --> 07:14.268
- to hear the voice of their master.
- Oh, are they?

07:14.685 --> 07:17.438
Well, why don't you tell me
how your guests' needs are met

07:17.813 --> 07:20.190
when your slaves can't hear them?

07:28.407 --> 07:30.117
- There.
- Thank you.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.370
This one is quite exemplary.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.583
In fact, she also travelled through time
with the Destroyer of Worlds.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.210
- Hmm?
- Which probably explains

07:40.419 --> 07:42.754
her flawless complexion.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.341
- Is she for sale?
- Not independently.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.969
She comes as a companion,
for she is quite adept

07:49.386 --> 07:51.180
at motivating the Destroyer.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.934
Well, I find the only motivation
people ever really need is pain.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.853
And its proper application.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.985
A wonderful sentiment.

08:06.528 --> 08:10.282
I should have expected no less from a man
with such an impressive brooch.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.409
Ah.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.871
I need you to go see what has been reaped
from today's harvest.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.923
- What? Terran food awaits?
- A bounty.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.258
Though the harvest is something else.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.929
Earlier today, my men were carrying out
the process of Terrigenesis,

08:33.472 --> 08:35.765
hoping to produce new Inhumans
for my guests.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.768
If any were so inclined.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.355
Depends on how many units I have left
after I purchase the Destroyer.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.441
It is said you are a man
of expensive tastes.

08:44.900 --> 08:50.614
We shall soon see if you have
the resources to support such desires.

08:59.957 --> 09:03.085
Every year, Kasius puts
all the 18-year-olds through Terrigenesis.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.629
- And that day's today?
- No, that was months ago.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.095
- Most of these kids are barely teenagers.
- That's the one in charge.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.430
Been working his way up
from the lower floors.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.058
I'm guessing this has something to do
with Kasius' big party.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.061
- More products, more profit.
- That's Flint.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.730
He doesn't have anyone
talking him through this?

09:23.981 --> 09:27.276
His parents were killed in a Renewal.
Virgil had a soft spot for the kid,

09:27.526 --> 09:31.488
was even teaching him to fly.
Gave him odds and ends to help him get by.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.865
You should go say something.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.458
Tess, this is crazy.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.836
I wasn't supposed to get misted
for another two years.

09:46.295 --> 09:49.047
- Just means you don't have to wait.
- Is this gonna mess me up?

09:50.048 --> 09:51.717
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.303
Going through the mist, it's no big deal.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.181
Terrigenesis is scary enough
without a bunch of hyenas watching.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.393
It's not their fault. These people
have all been fed the same lie.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.395
People believe what they want to believe.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.690
It's obvious they're lambs being led
to the slaughter.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.192
Let's just hope none
of these kids crust over.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.695
If I do turn...

10:12.404 --> 10:14.656
at least you won't have me coming around,
begging for scraps.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.953
I like having you come around.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.665
Children, it is time.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.923
It's all right.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.562
We seek a great bounty.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.315
Hoping that one of the young gathered
here today...

10:49.232 --> 10:51.777
ascends to something greater.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.539
Prepare to receive your gift from Kasius.

11:47.582 --> 11:48.625
Flint!

12:23.285 --> 12:24.286
Mmm!

12:24.619 --> 12:28.540
So, how are you faring
with that Vrellnexian litter I sold you?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.667
It has been trying.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.795
The savage beasts have proven
quite difficult to wrangle.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.715
Well, they're certainly not bred
to cuddle.

12:36.882 --> 12:37.966
They're creatures of war...

12:38.842 --> 12:40.343
not the shaggy dog of men.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.638
But I had hoped that the Vrells
would provide you a small triumph.

12:44.598 --> 12:48.059
Last time we spoke,
the strain of your exile seemed to...

12:49.311 --> 12:52.439
- wear heavy on your soul. Mm.
- I was never exiled.

12:52.814 --> 12:56.193
My father simply wanted me to oversee
his Earth project personally.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.904
While your brother oversees
the family empire.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.075
Kasius never offered me
as a fighter till today.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.536
Guess that's what I get for saving
your life.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.081
- I didn't ask you to help me.
- You were hoping for it.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.335
In your brain. Which is basically
the same thing for a mind-reader.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.422
Things are starting to turn in our favour,
so just trust me on this, okay?

13:17.589 --> 13:19.716
I'm really glad my Inhibitor's on
right now, so I can't hear

13:19.883 --> 13:21.343
whatever dumb idea's in your head.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.472
- We just need to work together.
- Stop thinking that you have a choice.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.474
We're slaves.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.814
I am sorry for getting you mixed up
in all this.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.196
Let's just hope one of us doesn't have
to kill the other.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.577
Dear friends,
in honour of Kasius

13:47.744 --> 13:51.373
presenting the Destroyer of Worlds,
I, too, have brought a rare delicacy

13:51.540 --> 13:52.958
for everyone's enjoyment...

13:53.875 --> 13:55.919
fresh Xandarian snail.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.172
- Oh!
- Mm.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.550
You are far too generous, Ponarian.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.094
Please keep that in mind
when the bidding begins.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.390
Mm.

14:08.557 --> 14:12.310
How do you keep your human population
so well under heel?

14:13.395 --> 14:14.604
He has them kill each other.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.406
Well, that's what I would do.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.243
Humans clearly have the numbers...

14:29.494 --> 14:30.787
so, fear is essential.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.748
And getting them to do it.
That is the trick.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.209
Ritualisation helps.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.378
Making it sort of a game.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.590
It's all very efficient, really...

14:45.093 --> 14:46.595
at least, in my experience.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.271
Seems we have similar minds.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.940
It has done wonder

14:59.107 --> 15:02.694
tamping down the humans' more
rebellious impulses.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.072
Mm.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.491
Oh.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.829
Well, I hope everyone's meal has been
to their liking.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.458
As for your more primal appetites,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.503
a fight to the death is moments away.
So, take a final look.

15:20.754 --> 15:25.258
One of these Inhumans will soon be
withdrawn from the marketplace.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.181
Marauder...

15:31.973 --> 15:33.808
you have yet to taste your snail.

15:36.394 --> 15:39.981
Perhaps unrefined men don't have
the stomach for such indulgences.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.280
I find...

15:47.948 --> 15:50.033
moist creatures...

15:52.869 --> 15:55.497
distasteful.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.793
Much like the fat mouths
slurping them down.

16:03.838 --> 16:04.839
Hmm.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.435
This Boshtok makes
for a lively dinner companion.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.358
Let us leave these snails to shrivel, huh?

16:25.360 --> 16:28.071
Much greater pursuits await our attention.

16:35.662 --> 16:40.709
- Maybe the boy's ability is to disappear.
- No, this is something else.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.503
Is he dead?

16:43.837 --> 16:45.130
How does someone just disappear like that?

16:45.296 --> 16:46.464
I'm really not sure...

16:49.009 --> 16:50.176
though I may have a theory.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.971
- We got to get back to The Exchange.
- It's not safe for you...

16:53.054 --> 16:55.306
- But the Guards will be looking for me.
- Only to sell you.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.437
But I get a better life
and the rest of the level profits.

17:00.603 --> 17:01.938
You get no better life.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.275
People who buy other people
are not good people.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.902
- They'll only hurt you.
- You don't know that.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.617
How did you do that?

17:16.661 --> 17:17.662
Tess.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.455
- Are you okay?
- No.

17:19.622 --> 17:23.292
- I was just kidnapped by a crazy woman.
- Yeah, the kid ain't wrong about that.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.252
Don't worry. She's with me.

17:25.462 --> 17:29.424
- Flint, this is Yo-Yo. She's Inhuman, too.
- Yeah, I kind of figured that already.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.718
Why aren't you living down
on the Kree levels?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.970
- I'm not really from here.
- None of us are.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.222
And she's not the only Inhuman with us.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.769
- You mean this guy?
- No, he's just cool.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.021
Look, we can't hide in here forever.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.732
Kasius' men will be looking for Flint
even as we speak.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.651
And Grill's reporting to his station boss.
He'll be back end of day.

17:48.818 --> 17:52.530
- We need to disappear long before that.
- Look, I could put in for a Trawler run.

17:52.989 --> 17:56.159
We hide Flint in the brig and head out.
Could buy us a couple days.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.952
Yeah, but without May,
we don't have a pilot.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.788
Least of our worries.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.539
Want any help?

18:02.415 --> 18:03.500
More people, more questions.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.251
Best I go on my own.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.214
Stay right here. Be back in a few.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.394
It is refreshing to have a man
of your calibre join our ranks.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.022
Would you care to join me
for the upcoming display?

18:27.023 --> 18:28.817
I'm eager to see everyone
you have to offer.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.945
Then I shall make every effort
not to disappoint.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.831
Our first contestant possesses
extraordinary skill.

18:43.248 --> 18:47.252
A telepath, able to read
his opponent's plan of attack

18:47.418 --> 18:48.920
before it is carried out.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.089
Ah.

18:51.673 --> 18:54.175
Normally, I'd pit Ben
against another Inhuman.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.302
Yet, for this select crowd...

18:57.095 --> 19:00.557
I've decided for a more unique opponent.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.725
One not of this time.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.936
This deadly assassin was trained

19:05.103 --> 19:08.815
by one of the galaxy's most despised
organizations.

19:09.524 --> 19:15.238
But most intriguing, she is also a friend
to the Destroyer of Worlds.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.074
Dear guests...

19:18.408 --> 19:19.909
...may I present to you...

19:22.036 --> 19:23.371
Melinda May...

19:24.873 --> 19:26.416
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.814
- You're cheating.
- And you're dying.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.401
How many travelled in time
with the Destroyer?

19:54.569 --> 19:57.488
My servant and Melinda May
are the only ones I've discovered,

19:57.822 --> 20:00.491
though Sinara remains convinced
there are more.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.664
The mind reader's a skilled fighter.
Speaks well of his training.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.460
Ben is quite talented for an Inhuman.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.588
But he wouldn't last a day
in my father's army.

20:14.005 --> 20:17.383
- You speak highly of your father.
- He's the greatest warrior I know.

20:18.968 --> 20:22.055
Ponarian made it seem as if you'd been
banished from your home world.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.059
Ponarian knows not of what he speaks.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.854
My father was disapproving.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.109
The things I did to earn his respect...

20:38.279 --> 20:39.530
they left scars.

20:40.615 --> 20:41.699
My own situation...

20:42.992 --> 20:44.619
is a tragic misunderstanding.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.586
No one can help you now.
Not even a guest of Kasius.

21:09.018 --> 21:12.021
<i>- You're doubting yourself.</i>
- Stay out of my head.

21:12.647 --> 21:16.276
My guess is you're selling the Destroyer
as a way to redeem yourself.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.737
I believe a great fortune
can smooth over any transgression.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.907
I'm prepared to help you with that.

21:26.327 --> 21:27.537
Don't make me the bad guy.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.540
<i>Kasius only tossed me in here
because I helped your friends.</i>

21:30.832 --> 21:33.084
Okay. Then I won't kill you.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.878
Thanks for promising not to do something
you can't...

21:40.300 --> 21:42.302
Didn't think, just did.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.790
- We have to work together.
- What is it with you guys and teamwork?

22:12.957 --> 22:14.584
This fight needs to end now,

22:15.126 --> 22:17.003
or else, they'll feed us both
to the Roaches on the surface.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.894
No way. Kasius isn't gonna change
the rules now.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.813
You just have to know who to ask.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.944
This fight bores me.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.161
I assure you it will end
in a most thrilling fashion.

22:50.328 --> 22:52.830
Sinara, have the guards throw in
more weapons.

22:53.331 --> 22:55.583
Lack of weapons is not the problem.

22:55.792 --> 23:00.755
I came to see the Destroyer fight,
not some ancient has-been.

23:01.631 --> 23:03.049
I'm afraid a life is owed.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.261
Send the Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
to the surface.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.848
The Vrellnexians will have much more use
for her than your weary audience.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.145
Guards!

23:16.813 --> 23:19.232
Escort the human woman
to the surface lift.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.152
Thank you.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.364
Unfortunately, your friend just delayed
the inevitable.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.241
No one can escape the Roaches.

23:29.700 --> 23:30.701
Ah!

23:31.285 --> 23:32.995
Ah.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.467
Have you seen the boy?

23:48.594 --> 23:51.639
Flint? Mm. Can't say I have.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.517
He's a total floor rat.
He could be anywhere.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.769
Or...

23:58.813 --> 24:00.231
you could be hiding him.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.736
- Why would I do that?
- I saw you together at the ceremony,

24:06.362 --> 24:08.322
offering the boy last words.

24:09.365 --> 24:10.825
Listen, Flint...

24:11.617 --> 24:15.413
He gets me things no one else can.
Giving the kid a pep talk?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.332
That was me just keeping
my business relationship on the steady.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.085
If I find you're keeping things from me...

24:22.086 --> 24:23.838
there will be consequences.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.841
Understood.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.634
We done here?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.144
Well, how come I don't have my powers yet?

24:38.478 --> 24:41.022
You have your power.
It just hasn't revealed itself.

24:41.606 --> 24:44.650
- How long did yours take?
- Oh, it was a total disaster.

24:45.067 --> 24:48.279
I crusted over three weeks earlier,
after eating fish soup and tacos.

24:48.446 --> 24:49.947
What are tacos?

24:50.114 --> 24:52.033
What the hell kind of future is this?

24:53.284 --> 24:54.368
Tacos are a food.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.705
Anyways, I had told myself
this was just a dream.

24:58.289 --> 25:01.459
And then my cousin Francisco calls
with bad news about his mum.

25:02.043 --> 25:04.378
I was upset, so I went to get a beer,
and... Whoosh!

25:04.795 --> 25:06.923
I'm back on my couch, beer in one hand.

25:07.131 --> 25:11.177
I realise I need a bottle opener,
and whoosh again, I'm back on my couch,

25:11.385 --> 25:13.721
- bottle opener in the other hand.
- What did you think was happening?

25:13.888 --> 25:15.598
Oh, my heart was beating so fast,

25:15.765 --> 25:17.558
I thought someone had put cocaine
in my beer.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.728
Whoa! Dial it back, Escobar.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.648
I got so worried, I told
my cousin Francisco to come over.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.441
He spent countless hours

25:25.608 --> 25:27.985
talking me out of an exorcism.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.365
That is a great story.

25:33.866 --> 25:37.370
Pretty sure Kasius is gonna wanna hear
that for himself.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.874
Ten thousand for the telepath!

25:42.041 --> 25:46.420
Kasius doesn't need money,
he wants weapons. Five Culverian Blasters.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.923
This is an auction,
Lady Karaba, not a flea market.

25:49.173 --> 25:52.051
Take your useless toys back
to the mud pits you crawled out of.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.970
My apologies to you both,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.973
but I cannot, in good faith,
sell this Inhuman.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.018
What dense thought rattles in your brain,
Kasius?

26:01.227 --> 26:04.063
If I wanted a tease, I would have visited
the brothels of Kitson.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.566
Your pent-up desires do not concern me.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.652
As to my reasoning...

26:17.743 --> 26:20.538
Perhaps you would care to illuminate
our guests.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.252
No. Please.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.965
It won't happen again. I was wrong.
Please!

26:31.132 --> 26:34.343
You see, Ben was present when I asked
the Destroyer if others had travelled

26:34.510 --> 26:38.055
through time with her. She insisted
that my servant was the only one

26:38.389 --> 26:41.851
- which turned out to be untrue.
- Kasius, th... it's not his fault. Kasius!

26:42.101 --> 26:43.436
He lied.

26:44.312 --> 26:47.106
Normally, that would not preclude him
from being sold.

26:47.732 --> 26:52.820
Only in this instance,
that lie was told to me.

26:55.197 --> 26:58.409
Is this really necessary?
Make one of the buyers discipline him.

26:58.784 --> 27:03.247
You of all people must understand.
No man of honour can allow the tongues

27:03.414 --> 27:07.209
- of his slaves to lie so boldly.
- I'm the one... I am the one to blame!

27:07.376 --> 27:08.878
- Not Ben!
- Perhaps.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.089
But he's far less valuable.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.926
<i>Don't blame yourself.</i>

27:21.057 --> 27:23.142
No! Ben!

27:23.934 --> 27:26.145
No! No, no, no.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.399
Hopefully, you found this display
more to your liking.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.327
You're home early.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.996
Thought I was getting called up
for another damn report.

27:44.372 --> 27:47.333
But turns out, my manager just wanted
to let me know

27:47.625 --> 27:51.170
that a Trawler pilot was fighting
in The Crater.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.464
- May.
- Is she all right?

27:54.131 --> 27:56.342
All right's not a word I would use
for someone

27:56.509 --> 27:58.511
who was chucked out as Roach food.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.430
Morsel, maybe.

28:02.556 --> 28:09.063
Now, it's time you tell me why the three
of you didn't have any Metrics.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.191
We came from the past to save the world.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.362
Are you... you speaking of...

28:19.031 --> 28:20.324
the Prophecy?

28:26.539 --> 28:28.624
Hey, look, I may be a rube,

28:28.874 --> 28:32.503
but only dumb rubes believe
in that prophecy nonsense.

28:33.045 --> 28:37.508
Though, I will be a rich rube
once I turn you four in to Kasius.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.051
You turn us in...

28:40.094 --> 28:41.595
- we're all dead.
- Listen.

28:42.972 --> 28:46.100
Once that creepy son of a bitch
pays me off...

28:46.892 --> 28:48.477
he can do whatever he wants.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.189
Now, being dead...

28:55.317 --> 28:57.153
might be your best option.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.084
I'm so sorry.

29:13.085 --> 29:17.047
Ben saved my life. He saved both
of our lives and Kasius just...

29:18.048 --> 29:20.593
murdered him while I stood there.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.179
There was nothing you could do.

29:23.804 --> 29:26.307
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Mm.

29:27.141 --> 29:28.642
Well, you'll have to get in line.

29:30.770 --> 29:31.771
So, you can hear now?

29:32.354 --> 29:34.482
Fitz tricked Kasius into turning
my hearing back on.

29:34.648 --> 29:37.526
- How is Fitz even here?
- I don't know. He just showed up

29:37.693 --> 29:41.071
- out of nowhere with his own spaceship.
- It's a baller move.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.741
Not to mention the whole
bounty hunter look he's rocking.

29:43.908 --> 29:45.367
Yeah, I still prefer him in cardigans.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.375
Do you have any idea what he's planning?

29:53.834 --> 29:56.378
Yeah, I'm not sure, actually.
We haven't had a moment to speak,

29:56.545 --> 29:58.172
though it would seem he's here
to purchase us.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.341
What if it doesn't work?

30:02.218 --> 30:03.427
I have a knife.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.346
We can do better.

30:05.846 --> 30:07.598
Well, there was limited cutlery
to choose from.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.100
No, with our plan. We have to figure out
a way to work together.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.271
Kasius has to turn my Inhibitor off
before the fight starts.

30:14.688 --> 30:15.856
We can make our move then.

30:16.607 --> 30:19.401
- Who are you facing?
- Someone disposable.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.780
I'm sure Fitz will be ready.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.701
- Here we are again.
- Us against the world.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.266
You must hurry. There's a situation.

30:57.648 --> 30:58.941
We have a problem.

31:01.652 --> 31:02.653
What is it now?

31:03.237 --> 31:07.283
Someone new has arrived to acquire
the Destroyer of Worlds from Kasius.

31:08.951 --> 31:11.620
- Someone more wealthy than me?
- And more feared.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.330
His brother.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.668
Why does Kasius have people fighting
downstairs, Grill?

31:17.835 --> 31:20.462
All part of the fun and games.

31:22.506 --> 31:24.592
Let's just hope he doesn't choose you.

31:28.762 --> 31:31.223
Hey! He's just a kid!

31:31.390 --> 31:32.850
I'm starting to think

31:33.017 --> 31:35.769
that Zev didn't deserve to die.

31:36.145 --> 31:39.773
That maybe your girlfriend set him up.

31:42.318 --> 31:45.404
Nothing says that I gotta turn you
in cherry.

31:45.696 --> 31:49.617
So, you know,
maybe I will just watch you sizzle.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.505
Hey, knock it off, junior.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.758
- I don't know how.
- Well, you figure it out!

32:06.216 --> 32:07.927
Flint, look at me.

32:08.552 --> 32:09.553
This is your gift.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.263
You can control it.

32:21.023 --> 32:24.109
You stop it, or I will stop you.

32:51.553 --> 32:52.972
- Kasius.
- Hmm.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.392
What is this about your brother coming
for the Destroyer?

32:57.309 --> 32:58.435
If you'd excuse me?

32:59.603 --> 33:03.399
Isn't it wonderful? The journey
from my home world is significant,

33:03.565 --> 33:06.819
so Father must be quite serious
if he sent Faulnak in person.

33:07.611 --> 33:12.032
I'm also serious, and I guarantee you
I have travelled a much longer journey.

33:12.282 --> 33:14.159
And it has been a privilege having you.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.163
No. Not if I don't get the Destroyer.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.625
You promised me a chance to make an offer.

33:22.126 --> 33:23.752
Which I look forward to entertaining...

33:24.753 --> 33:27.464
though I would encourage you to consider
one of my other Inhumans.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.350
That did not appear to go well.

33:40.561 --> 33:42.688
Let's hope the rest does.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.733
Okay, then.

33:47.818 --> 33:49.361
There's one last thing I need you to do.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.944
Our fate is soon at hand, Sinara.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.282
Ah.

34:37.076 --> 34:38.702
It is an honour to have you join us,
brother.

34:38.994 --> 34:42.289
There is no honour to be found
in this human cesspool.

34:42.831 --> 34:43.998
Yet here you stand.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.337
There must be something of worth
for you to travel such a great distance.

34:48.545 --> 34:51.507
- I'm only here because of Father's orders.
- Oh.

34:51.672 --> 34:55.761
It pleases to hear Father sent you,
his most trusted messenger.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.681
This Destroyer had better be
what you say...

35:00.641 --> 35:03.894
or I'll gladly remind you
of the many shapes my anger takes.

35:04.812 --> 35:05.896
Yes.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.525
You were always quick to offer
a demonstration.

35:10.651 --> 35:13.195
Perhaps now I can present one of my own.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.990
The Destroyer is set to battle
one of my most prised Inhumans...

35:17.157 --> 35:20.494
I have no desire to see one
of your homegrown experiments fight.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.497
The Destroyer must face a Kree warrior.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.001
Your stray shall suffice.

35:31.088 --> 35:34.675
- But Sinara is not prepared for battle.
- Is she not your greatest warrior?

35:36.385 --> 35:38.387
You cower behind her as though she is.

35:41.557 --> 35:42.975
Perhaps I have misjudged...

35:43.851 --> 35:45.686
and you no longer seek Father's approval.

35:48.897 --> 35:49.940
Of course.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.694
Sinara would be honoured to fight.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.207
Well...

36:10.544 --> 36:14.882
I understand this is sudden,
but it presents a tremendous opportunity.

36:15.966 --> 36:20.262
Everything I have been striving for
is but one fight away.

36:21.597 --> 36:22.848
To the death.

36:25.142 --> 36:26.143
Yes.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.729
That is what has been promised.

36:32.983 --> 36:38.739
I have every confidence that you will
provide us all a great spectacle.

36:48.790 --> 36:52.336
- No. I can't be here anymore.
- Hey, hold on.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.171
- It's too dangerous out there.
- It's better than staring

36:54.254 --> 36:58.842
at the guy I just killed! I knew him!
He was one of my best customers.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.886
Even gave me spare tokens
from time to time.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.138
What happened to Grill is not your fault.

37:04.306 --> 37:07.643
You had no choice. He was gonna kill us.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.853
Now, Mack and I, we're gonna go find Tess,

37:10.354 --> 37:12.648
and we're gonna get you on a Trawler,
okay?

37:16.318 --> 37:17.402
Go.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.535
Kid should be playing ball or running
for student council.

37:25.786 --> 37:28.247
- Or class treasurer.
- That's pretty specific.

37:28.538 --> 37:31.583
Ah, I've served three terms.
I'm a pretty financially responsible dude.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.090
Tess.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.093
They killed her
because she wouldn't give up Flint.

37:41.343 --> 37:42.427
She's already dead.

37:42.970 --> 37:45.889
The only thing we can do now is try
to keep Flint from meeting that same end.

37:46.515 --> 37:47.557
Come on.

37:48.016 --> 37:51.770
Now, our main event.
One of the galaxy's deadliest forces.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.231
Yet tonight, she fights
for your enjoyment.

37:54.648 --> 37:57.651
Dear friends, may I present to you...

38:00.696 --> 38:04.658
Quake, the Destroyer of Worlds!

38:20.465 --> 38:23.719
This puny girl is your Destroyer?

38:24.678 --> 38:27.431
Your rush to judgment has always been
a shortcoming, brother.

38:28.015 --> 38:30.434
Allow me to switch off
the Destroyer's Inhibitor.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.686
Then you shall see her true nature.

38:33.478 --> 38:37.441
Of course, before I unleash her,
we must take precaution.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.498
Would you care to give the opening
commencement?

39:00.797 --> 39:03.425
Seems your stray is done taking orders.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.014
All right, you freaky blue bitch.

39:09.848 --> 39:10.932
Let's do this.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.647
This is for Ben.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.955
Guards! Guards, stop them.

41:08.508 --> 41:09.885
I'm never leaving you again.

41:15.015 --> 41:17.684
- Then marry me, Fitz.
- Absolutely.

41:19.269 --> 41:20.479
Okay, come on.

41:23.690 --> 41:25.567
Also, um, just to say,
I did propose earlier

41:25.692 --> 41:27.569
- when Kasius had your hearing turned off.
- Oh, of course you did.

41:30.113 --> 41:31.281
No, I... Seriously, I did.

41:41.124 --> 41:42.209
Hello, friend.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.963
- Who are you?
- I am a Kree.

41:48.131 --> 41:50.175
As I have always been, brother.

41:55.639 --> 41:58.683
Do you know where you're going?
People don't come back from there...

42:02.187 --> 42:04.606
I am not a person.
