<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

00:16.044 --> 00:17.263
<i>What am I doing on a walk?</i>

00:17.414 --> 00:19.827
<i>Well, there's only so much</i>

00:19.946 --> 00:22.544

00:22.659 --> 00:24.396

00:24.531 --> 00:26.630

(Axl and Sue grunting)
<i>Oh, right. Here.</i>

00:35.263 --> 00:37.939
Mom! Axl ate my cheese
and sausage display!

00:38.056 --> 00:40.184
Mom's fault! Now that she's
home, she eats all our food.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.768
I need this display, Axl!

00:41.905 --> 00:44.173
Mom and dad only pay for half
my trip to Cincinnati,

00:44.297 --> 00:45.266
and we are responsible

00:45.366 --> 00:47.048
for fund-raising
the other half ourselves.

00:47.159 --> 00:49.461
Oh, this is for you to leave?
How much to get you to Alaska?

00:50.208 --> 00:53.031
Thank you guys <i>so</i> much.

00:53.199 --> 00:54.823
It's a really big deal
for the mascot

00:54.947 --> 00:56.216
to be asked on the band trip.

00:56.350 --> 00:58.548
Unprecedented, actually.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.722
I am making up a whole new
routine for the competition.

01:01.878 --> 01:02.972
Look.

01:04.293 --> 01:05.254
Don't show us too much.

01:05.339 --> 01:07.772
We... wanna be surprised
when we see the tape.

01:08.566 --> 01:10.235
I just wish
you were still at Ehlert's.

01:10.352 --> 01:12.217
Do you think you're gonna get
a new job anytime soon?

01:12.383 --> 01:14.499
Well, it's a big decision,
going back to school.

01:14.612 --> 01:15.689
I want to make
the right choice.

01:15.810 --> 01:16.696
Hey, what do you think about me

01:16.777 --> 01:18.884
being a crime scene investigator, huh?
(Door closes)

01:18.992 --> 01:20.885
A CSI sounds pretty cool
at cocktail parties.

01:21.028 --> 01:24.291
There's no crime in Orson...
or cocktail parties. (Liquid spilling)

01:24.426 --> 01:26.279
Brick, why don't you
use a bowl?

01:26.425 --> 01:28.441
A plate of water
just has a nice ring to it.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.383
So I guess it's my turn
to feed the bunny again?

01:31.479 --> 01:33.446
It's always your turn.
It's your bunny.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.464
I didn't ask for it,
I didn't buy it,

01:35.617 --> 01:37.466
and yet I'm stuck feeding it.

01:37.593 --> 01:38.633
Yeah, join the club.

01:38.852 --> 01:40.080
Mm. Mm!
(Water spills)

01:40.532 --> 01:41.928
You're making a mess.
Here, give that to me.

01:42.034 --> 01:43.162
You've gotta get to school.

01:43.275 --> 01:45.112
Actually, I was thinking
about taking a personal day.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.733
Why? What's going on
in school?

01:47.834 --> 01:48.793
It's just we're getting

01:48.913 --> 01:50.309
the human development
talk today.

01:50.452 --> 01:52.608
I guess they put girls in
one room, boys in the other,

01:52.733 --> 01:53.860
and make us all
watch this movie,

01:53.981 --> 01:55.513
"what's going on
down there?"

01:55.638 --> 01:56.821
And then we talk about it.

01:56.973 --> 01:59.357
Do I have to go?
It's embarrassing.

01:59.522 --> 02:00.628
You don't need a movie.

02:00.767 --> 02:01.871
Here's all
you need to know--

02:02.010 --> 02:05.107
before, after. (Laughs)
(Crunches)

02:05.673 --> 02:07.654
Don't sweat it, Brick.
You're just growing up.

02:07.777 --> 02:09.088
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.403
And anyway,
you already know the basics.

02:13.495 --> 02:15.922
You did have the talk
with him, didn't you?

02:16.162 --> 02:18.474
I thought so.
I-I can't remember.

02:18.581 --> 02:20.720
You must have, 'cause I know
I talked to Sue.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.307
- Didn't I?
- I don't know.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.459
- But I definitely talked to Axl.
- Okay.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.588
Hang on.

02:25.691 --> 02:27.312
Well, that's what school's for.
(Cereal rattles)

02:27.744 --> 02:29.645
Ha! Brainstorm.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.378
Since mom has
no current place of business,

02:31.493 --> 02:32.883
and I already hit
all the neighbors,

02:33.010 --> 02:35.087
why don't I come
to the quarry after school

02:35.242 --> 02:36.750
and sell
my cheese and sausage there?

02:36.854 --> 02:38.204
Uh, no, Sue,
I don't wanna do that.

02:38.331 --> 02:39.856
The guys will feel obligated
to buy from you

02:39.977 --> 02:40.905
'cause I'm the boss.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.484
Exactly.

02:45.453 --> 02:48.013
Sorry about this.
You know, kids.

02:48.134 --> 02:49.177
Yeah, kids.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.075
When mine wanted
to sell wrapping paper here,

02:51.217 --> 02:53.864
you said there was
a no soliciting policy at work.

02:54.047 --> 02:55.407
Door's open now, Mike.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.713
My girl's selling
popcorn tins again.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.440
She's the only one in her troop

02:59.538 --> 03:00.820
that didn't get to meet
Jane Pauley last year

03:00.939 --> 03:02.190
because of you.

03:02.709 --> 03:04.962
(Lowered voice) I got a hunch
she'll be going this year.

03:10.749 --> 03:13.345
Payday. Mike Heck around?

03:13.544 --> 03:15.342
Uh, no. He's with
the yellow hat guys.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.514
But I'm his daughter.
You can leave it with me.

04:10.433 --> 04:11.856

04:11.981 --> 04:14.504
Yeah, yeah.
Mailbox like a cow. You told me.

04:14.627 --> 04:16.130
No. You're not
gonna believe it.

04:16.435 --> 04:18.940
Rita Glossner.
She's back.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.288
Really? Are we sure
she was ever gone?

04:21.444 --> 04:23.367
I don't know,
but she's back. (Sighs)

04:23.476 --> 04:24.839
Well, leave her alone.

04:24.954 --> 04:26.007
Just don't start anything.

04:26.106 --> 04:26.924
(Mouth full) Oh, I didn't.

04:27.030 --> 04:28.850
When I saw her,
I ran right home.

04:28.974 --> 04:30.642
Good. Don't even
make eye contact.

04:33.338 --> 04:34.529
Aw, Frankie!

04:34.639 --> 04:36.808
I know! I tried not to,
but I think I did.

04:36.938 --> 04:39.214
My eyes were just
looking that way,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.634
and then she was there,
and her eyes were there.

04:41.764 --> 04:43.448
And before I knew it,
I was looking at her,

04:43.562 --> 04:45.747
and I think she saw me, too.
I didn't mean to!

04:45.900 --> 04:48.424
Oh, stupid eyes.
(Door opens and closes)

04:48.627 --> 04:49.611
(Brick) Ugh.

04:49.783 --> 04:51.100
Thank God that's over.

04:51.483 --> 04:52.758
(Bottles clinking) Oh, right.

04:52.831 --> 04:54.041
How'd the big talk go?
(Refrigerator closes)

04:54.172 --> 04:56.487
Well... (Sighs) The nurse
made us watch a movie

04:56.589 --> 04:58.315
where a boy kept running
around a track.

04:58.455 --> 05:00.573
It was boring, so Dillon Murray

05:00.689 --> 05:02.210
made an inappropriate
shadow puppet,

05:02.346 --> 05:04.488
and everybody giggled
and the nurse yelled at us.

05:04.785 --> 05:05.864
Yep, sounds about right.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.572
Then when she put
the movie back on,

05:07.677 --> 05:09.283
the boy took a cheerleader
roller skating

05:09.392 --> 05:10.891
and bought her some ice cream.

05:11.176 --> 05:13.084
After he got home,
he took a long shower,

05:13.196 --> 05:16.550
and a doctor told us not
to feel bad about our urges.

05:16.833 --> 05:17.905
Then the girls came back in

05:18.014 --> 05:20.416
and they had little pink
gift bags that we didn't get.

05:20.555 --> 05:22.053
That doesn't seem fair.

05:22.177 --> 05:23.521
Well, at least
you got through it.

05:23.929 --> 05:25.139
Not really.
They're making us

05:25.253 --> 05:27.100
have a follow-up discussion
next week.

05:27.358 --> 05:29.184
When does all
this sex stuff end?

05:29.540 --> 05:31.863
It... tapers off.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.448
Okay. Well, I guess I'll go
look at your bras now.

05:34.597 --> 05:35.876
I'm not sure why,
but apparently,

05:35.999 --> 05:37.157
it's totally normal.

05:37.395 --> 05:39.848
And you guys are always after me
to be normal, so...

05:48.183 --> 05:49.643
Car salesman?

05:49.759 --> 05:52.992
There's a class for that?
Guess I should have taken it.

05:53.148 --> 05:54.252
(Doorbell rings)

05:58.323 --> 05:59.958
I want my hose back.

06:00.188 --> 06:02.608
- What?
- My hose. You took it.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.561
Now what am I supposed to do,

06:03.666 --> 06:05.391
wait for the rain
to fill up my pool?

06:05.538 --> 06:06.718
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:06.817 --> 06:07.784
I don't have your hose.

06:07.929 --> 06:09.013
Right.

06:09.355 --> 06:10.951
I seen you casing my house,

06:11.254 --> 06:13.187
walking by, staring at me.

06:13.349 --> 06:15.497
No, no.
I was just... looking.

06:15.623 --> 06:17.668
N-not even a look.
Just a glance.

06:17.789 --> 06:20.031
Just 'cause we didn't know
you were back in town.

06:20.032 --> 06:22.218
You've been gossiping
about me behind my back?

06:22.421 --> 06:23.779
No, no.
No one did that.

06:24.123 --> 06:26.456
We were just wondering,
you know, a-about your kids.

06:26.601 --> 06:28.901
You got no business
wondering about <i>my</i> kids.

06:29.009 --> 06:30.842
My kids were fine.
People was looking in on 'em.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.061
Good. Good.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.887
That's responsible.
Looking in.

06:34.014 --> 06:36.081
Hey, you know,
m-maybe you should

06:36.212 --> 06:37.857
ask one of <i>them</i>
about your hose.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.441
Maybe one of your boys has it.

06:39.687 --> 06:42.167
You think my kids stole it?
Is that what you're hinting at?

06:42.279 --> 06:44.450
No, no.
I-I never said "stole."

06:44.574 --> 06:46.356
You know, I ought
to punch your boobs in.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.580
But I won't, 'cause I'm a lady.

06:48.986 --> 06:51.205
But if that hose ain't back
in my yard by tomorrow,

06:51.350 --> 06:53.892
I'm gonna rain fire down
on your house.

06:56.307 --> 06:58.122
Well, I won't be able
to put it out!

06:58.819 --> 06:59.627
(Clatter)

06:59.783 --> 07:02.011
'Cause I didn't take your hose!

07:08.702 --> 07:10.956
She can't really
rain fire, can she?

07:11.060 --> 07:12.864
I mean, she'd have to be Zeus
to pull that off.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.663
Oh, Sue, your check
and your permission slip

07:14.774 --> 07:15.574
are on the table.

07:15.672 --> 07:17.329
But tell 'em not
to cash it till Friday.

07:17.555 --> 07:19.117
Oh... yeah.

07:19.274 --> 07:21.460
Turns out I won't need it
after all.

07:21.658 --> 07:22.565
I'm not going.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.160
What?

07:24.402 --> 07:26.196
Why not?
Did the trip get canceled?

07:26.440 --> 07:29.539
Uh, they decided mascots
weren't allowed anymore.

07:29.798 --> 07:30.754
Oh, well.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.087
Really? And you were
so excited.

07:34.201 --> 07:35.160
What happened?

07:35.327 --> 07:38.161
Uh, yeah. Apparently
they had some concerns.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.941
Uh, it's really hot this year.

07:40.076 --> 07:42.071
Mascots are dropping
like flies,

07:42.185 --> 07:44.398
<i>and</i> they think
we distract from the music.

07:44.556 --> 07:47.220
Also, they're really worried
about mascot safety,

07:47.327 --> 07:49.413
because too many hours
in the giant head

07:49.550 --> 07:50.936
can hurt your spine.

07:51.231 --> 07:52.435
That's actually a big one.

07:52.574 --> 07:53.792
I should have said
that one first.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.730
Oh, honey, that really sucks.

07:55.833 --> 07:57.255
I know how much
you were looking forward--

07:57.378 --> 08:00.336
(Clattering, motor revving)

08:08.402 --> 08:09.505
<i>Mike wanted to call the cops,</i>

08:09.622 --> 08:11.096
<i>but I knew that'd only</i>
<i>make things worse.</i>

08:11.238 --> 08:11.942
<i>So the next day,</i>

08:12.058 --> 08:13.777
<i>I asked Axl to keep an eye</i>
<i>on the house--</i>

08:13.930 --> 08:16.170
<i>a job he took</i>
<i>surprisingly seriously.</i>

08:17.266 --> 08:19.205
Okay. I checked
the whole neighborhood,

08:19.297 --> 08:20.722
but this is all
the poop I could find.

08:20.854 --> 08:22.185
I was hoping for more ammo,

08:22.294 --> 08:23.717
but that'll do.

08:24.613 --> 08:25.495
Water balloon?

08:25.741 --> 08:28.176
It's not water. (Laughs)
You know.

08:28.435 --> 08:29.223
(Rustling)

08:29.375 --> 08:30.595
It's me, Sue.

08:32.157 --> 08:33.236
You guys...

08:33.365 --> 08:34.510
I have to tell you something.

08:34.703 --> 08:35.922
I don't know if I should say,

08:36.046 --> 08:39.057
but it's just so big,
I can't hold it in anymore.

08:39.587 --> 08:43.086
Mom and dad have been keeping
a terrible secret from us.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.679
We're poor!

08:46.114 --> 08:48.419
Oh, no. What'll they say
at the club?

08:48.577 --> 08:49.825
It's the truth, Axl.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.928
I accidentally peeked
at dad's paycheck

08:52.038 --> 08:53.799
and saw how much money
he makes.

08:53.976 --> 08:57.879
Sue, we go out after tornadoes
looking for clothes. We know.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.501
We have to do something
to help.

08:59.646 --> 09:01.972
I gave up my trip so they
don't have to pay for it,

09:02.091 --> 09:03.592
and you guys better start
thinking of ways

09:03.714 --> 09:04.934
we can save money, too.

09:05.049 --> 09:07.668
No way. It's their fault.
They don't know how to budget.

09:07.785 --> 09:09.160
They should have stopped
having kids after me.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.607
You guys are
the real money drain

09:10.762 --> 09:13.022
with your braces
and your <i>special school.</i>

09:13.161 --> 09:14.728
I don't go to a special school.

09:15.796 --> 09:16.928
You don't?

09:17.038 --> 09:18.512
I just feel so bad for them.

09:18.646 --> 09:21.235
They must be
so worried all the time.

09:21.354 --> 09:22.826
That's probably why
they're so cranky.

09:22.967 --> 09:23.945
<i>Right.</i>

09:24.082 --> 09:26.189
These might not even be
their real personalities.

09:26.326 --> 09:28.991
They could be lovely people.
We don't know.

09:29.323 --> 09:32.336
Oh, I just wish I'd never looked
at that stupid paycheck.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.885
Stop whining. It's about time
you joined the real world.

09:35.011 --> 09:36.141
Welcome to adulthood.

09:36.259 --> 09:38.568
Now arm yourselves with a poop
bomb and get ready to throw.

09:39.659 --> 09:40.265
Ugh.

09:41.574 --> 09:44.013
Mm. Here.
Take these outside.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.547
The boys are eating
in the bunker tonight.

09:45.739 --> 09:46.406
Frankie...

09:46.509 --> 09:48.102
Well, we can't just abandon it.

09:48.217 --> 09:50.312
It's almost dark.
That's prime Glossner time.

09:50.455 --> 09:52.803
Our kids are living
in an old picnic table.

09:52.924 --> 09:54.044
Even for us, that's weird.

09:54.172 --> 09:56.277
Look, I've got
a plan to fix this.

09:56.414 --> 09:58.962
Let's say we buy her
a new hose,

09:59.073 --> 10:00.262
just to keep the peace.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.006
We can't do that.
That's admitting guilt.

10:02.131 --> 10:04.441
Rain of fire, Mike.
Rain of fire.

10:04.566 --> 10:05.985
So that's it?
This is our life now?

10:06.149 --> 10:07.921
Pretty much.

10:08.072 --> 10:10.721
Unless I end up being
a really successful...

10:11.198 --> 10:13.782
car salesman. Seriously?

10:17.506 --> 10:20.168
(Both crunching)

10:23.352 --> 10:24.144
(Exhales)

10:24.271 --> 10:26.189
You know, I should
probably stay here

10:26.298 --> 10:27.910
and keep guard tomorrow, too.

10:28.134 --> 10:30.083
Guess I'll never know
what's going on down there.

10:30.193 --> 10:32.665
Dude, you're gonna want
to know that stuff.

10:33.035 --> 10:36.034
Trust me, one day, you're gonna
be just as excited about girls

10:36.149 --> 10:37.610
as you are about books.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.978
I don't really
see that happening.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.959
Okay. When you go a day
without reading a book,

10:43.110 --> 10:45.010
how do you feel?

10:45.766 --> 10:47.235
Like I'm going crazy.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.936
I just wanna get
my hands on one.

10:49.059 --> 10:50.457
Exactly.
That's how you're gonna feel

10:50.564 --> 10:51.726
about girls some day.

10:52.544 --> 10:53.450
I don't know.

10:54.064 --> 10:56.429
I'm still confused about
all that stuff in the movie.

10:56.696 --> 10:59.025
Maybe I should just go
to the library and research it.

10:59.144 --> 11:01.918
You don't need the library.
That's what the ax-man's for.

11:02.307 --> 11:03.022
Huh?

11:03.437 --> 11:04.476
Let me break this down
for you...

11:05.485 --> 11:08.313
<i>So over the next two hours,</i>
<i>Axl explained everything...</i>

11:08.873 --> 11:10.833
<i>in graphic detail.</i>

11:18.248 --> 11:19.629
And that's...

11:19.762 --> 11:21.012
why you gotta pretend to listen

11:21.119 --> 11:22.902
when chicks talk
about their feelings.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.952
<i>I know, I know.</i>
<i>Not my best moment.</i>

11:29.100 --> 11:30.963
<i>Mike's usually</i>
<i>pretty smart about things.</i>

11:31.174 --> 11:32.139
<i>But if you ask me,</i>

11:32.238 --> 11:35.660
<i>$13.99 is a small price</i>
<i>to pay for peace.</i>

11:35.885 --> 11:37.705
<i>Like the Peyton Manning</i>
<i>football I gave him</i>

11:37.803 --> 11:39.627
<i>that wasn't really signed</i>
<i>by Peyton Manning,</i>

11:39.775 --> 11:42.104
<i>he just doesn't need to know.</i>

11:45.304 --> 11:46.772
<i>Wow. For someone</i>
<i>with such big feet,</i>

11:46.891 --> 11:48.027
<i>she sure is quiet.</i>

11:48.130 --> 11:50.234
What are <i>you</i> doing in <i>my</i> yard?

11:50.587 --> 11:54.101
Oh, I, uh, was,
uh, walking at night,

11:54.237 --> 11:56.699
you know, like I always do.
You've probably seen me.

11:56.848 --> 11:58.058
And I noticed that, uh,

11:58.203 --> 12:00.154
oh, your hose is here
after all.

12:00.264 --> 12:01.729
Isn't that funny?
(Laughs)

12:01.839 --> 12:03.016
That's not my hose.

12:03.198 --> 12:05.478
Oh, I don't know.
I'm pretty sure it is.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.524
It looks like it.
Squirts water.

12:08.823 --> 12:10.077
Mine's orange.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.917
Really? Huh.

12:13.181 --> 12:15.689
Who would have guessed?
That's such a rare color.

12:16.298 --> 12:17.981
Well, a hose is a hose.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.828
Here, go ahead.
Take it.

12:19.963 --> 12:21.339
I don't want that crappy hose.

12:21.845 --> 12:23.405
Well, yeah,
this is even better.

12:23.517 --> 12:25.339
I mean, your hose was old
and beaten up,

12:25.465 --> 12:27.421
and look-- this is all shiny
and brand-new.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.453
You sure do know
a lot about my hose

12:29.577 --> 12:31.044
for someone who didn't take it.

12:31.157 --> 12:32.162
Hose thief!

12:33.105 --> 12:35.786
Okay, that's it.
I am a good neighbor.

12:35.978 --> 12:38.182
I don't steal.
My family doesn't steal.

12:38.312 --> 12:40.233
<i>Your</i> family's
the one who steals!

12:40.328 --> 12:41.297
I don't like
what you're implying.

12:41.392 --> 12:42.165
I'm not implying anything.

12:42.264 --> 12:44.385
It's a fact. Your kids
are a bunch of hooligans!

12:44.494 --> 12:45.758
They take everything
in the neighborhood--

12:45.887 --> 12:47.964
bikes, toys, shrubbery.

12:48.074 --> 12:50.855
Don't you talk about my kids.
Them's good boys.

12:50.975 --> 12:54.475
- Where you been at?!
- None of your damn business.

12:56.745 --> 12:57.764
(Burps)

12:58.834 --> 13:00.158
You expect me to believe

13:00.288 --> 13:02.233
that you're dumb enough
to bring back a hose

13:02.355 --> 13:04.359
that you didn't even take
in the first place?

13:04.572 --> 13:05.529
Fine. You know what?

13:05.656 --> 13:07.524
I tried to be nice,
but I'm done.

13:07.731 --> 13:10.537
I'm taking it home.
It's my hose now.

13:10.627 --> 13:12.591
Oh, so you're gonna steal it
a second time?

13:12.703 --> 13:15.433
You said you didn't want it!
It's on my property!

13:15.987 --> 13:18.019
No! I'm taking it back!
Let go!

13:18.145 --> 13:19.465
You let go!

13:19.575 --> 13:22.627
It's not your hose, lady!
You said you didn't want it! Give it!

13:22.763 --> 13:24.431
Uhh!
(Clink)

13:25.223 --> 13:26.378
Ow. (Exhales)

13:36.594 --> 13:37.278
Morning.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.019
Morning.

13:39.124 --> 13:40.075
Is there coffee?

13:40.190 --> 13:41.339
<i>Yep.</i>

13:44.822 --> 13:45.795
Somethin' wrong?

13:47.120 --> 13:48.179
(Pouring coffee)
Okay, if I tell you,

13:48.278 --> 13:49.764
you have to promise
not to get mad.

13:50.306 --> 13:51.505
I can't make that promise.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.303
(Coffeepot clatters)
Something happened last night.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.006
What the hell?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.810
- How'd you do that?
- I went over to the Glossners'.

14:01.014 --> 14:04.203
Frankie, I told you
that was a bad idea.

14:04.369 --> 14:05.440
She didn't hit you, did she?

14:05.555 --> 14:06.824
No, the hose did.

14:06.989 --> 14:08.559
What, she found the hose?

14:08.751 --> 14:10.555
Not exactly.

14:11.405 --> 14:12.812
(Sighs) Look, I know you
didn't love the idea,

14:12.924 --> 14:14.961
but I bought her a new hose
and went over there to leave it.

14:15.082 --> 14:16.423
But Rita caught me,
and she called me a thief,

14:16.560 --> 14:17.483
which, I mean, come on.

14:17.578 --> 14:19.398
So we got in a fight,
and the hose chipped my tooth.

14:19.502 --> 14:21.420
Listen, I don't want to hear
a bunch of "I told you sos."

14:21.520 --> 14:23.058
How many do I get?
Give me a number.

14:23.173 --> 14:24.405
Look, I did the honorable thing

14:24.508 --> 14:26.000
and snuck over there
in the middle of the night.

14:26.105 --> 14:28.058
Could you cover your mouth
while you talk?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.442
It's that noticeable?

14:29.620 --> 14:30.892
You're actually
starting to look like

14:31.032 --> 14:32.342
you're in our income bracket.

14:32.807 --> 14:33.920
(Sighs) It's that bad, huh?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.681
Ah, I'd better call the dentist
and see if he can squeeze me in

14:36.827 --> 14:39.156
before Ehlert realizes
I'm still on his insurance.

14:39.844 --> 14:40.996
(Doorbell rings)

14:45.462 --> 14:47.570
Mr. Heck, how <i>are</i> you?

14:48.158 --> 14:50.819
Fine.
Sue, your friends are here!

14:50.950 --> 14:52.278
(Sue) Be out in a minute!

14:53.927 --> 14:55.322
Brad and I are taking Sue
to the mall,

14:55.513 --> 14:58.084
but don't worry, we're not
gonna spend any money.

14:58.216 --> 14:59.845
Because <i>things</i>
don't make you happy.

14:59.958 --> 15:00.786
People do.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.599
But if Sue wants a Fro-Yo,
I can pay for it

15:02.718 --> 15:05.108
with the money I made juggling
at the ren fair this summer.

15:05.225 --> 15:06.654
That's short
for "renaissance."

15:06.936 --> 15:08.330
You don't have to
explain everything.

15:08.505 --> 15:10.886
Oh! I almost forgot.
I come bearing gifts.

15:11.742 --> 15:14.668
For Brick, some of
my favorite hand-me downs.

15:15.010 --> 15:18.319
For Mrs. Heck,
the Ali MacGraw yoga workout.

15:18.443 --> 15:20.485
It's like an antidepressant
in a VHS tape.

15:20.677 --> 15:23.391
And for you, Mr. Heck,
a hug.

15:24.005 --> 15:25.887
Hey, Sue! You don't want
to keep your friends waiting!

15:29.423 --> 15:31.597
Anyway, uh,
it's nice of you guys

15:31.680 --> 15:32.802
to get Sue out of the house.

15:32.928 --> 15:34.566
She's been kind of down
since they told her

15:34.671 --> 15:36.271
that the mascots
can't go on that trip.

15:36.551 --> 15:38.362
What? Yeah, they can.

15:38.923 --> 15:41.777
No, I think
you're wrong, Carly.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.665
You know what?
Uh, you guys go on ahead.

15:46.838 --> 15:48.209
I gotta talk
to Sue about something.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.535
Okay, but remember,
Mr. Heck,

15:49.657 --> 15:50.594
I'm not just her friend.

15:50.702 --> 15:52.649
I'm here for you, too, 24/7.

15:52.796 --> 15:55.670
Tweet me. We can also
Facebook, Skype, G-Chat.

15:55.787 --> 15:57.711
- You want me to write this all down?
- I'm good.

15:57.881 --> 15:58.956
(Whispers) Okay.

16:01.657 --> 16:03.634
Hey. So I was just wondering,

16:03.742 --> 16:06.032
who exactly decided
you couldn't go on this trip?

16:08.064 --> 16:09.808
I saw your paycheck,
okay? (Gasps)

16:09.928 --> 16:11.640
I am so, so sorry.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.094
It was just sitting there
on the desk,

16:13.211 --> 16:15.039
a-and they didn't lick
the sticky part,

16:15.154 --> 16:17.199
so it was open, and I looked,
and I saw how much you make,

16:17.311 --> 16:19.060
and my trip costs
too much money.

16:19.194 --> 16:20.273
I don't wanna go!

16:20.393 --> 16:21.901
What? Sue, what are you
talking about?

16:22.862 --> 16:24.233
I know you don't
get paid a lot of money.

16:24.430 --> 16:26.398
A-and I am a horrible person

16:26.518 --> 16:28.063
because I am always
asking for stuff,

16:28.206 --> 16:31.042
and mom doesn't have a job,
and you work all the time,

16:31.215 --> 16:33.779
and our TV has a weird,
squiggly line down the middle.

16:33.938 --> 16:35.645
But just last week,
I had mom buy me

16:35.770 --> 16:37.271
a "girls rule the world"
pencil case.

16:37.408 --> 16:38.949
I am so selfish!

16:39.125 --> 16:41.408
Sue, you're not selfish.
You're a normal kid.

16:41.662 --> 16:44.136
But I already know
girls rule the world.

16:44.261 --> 16:46.281
So do I really need to read it
on a pencil case?

16:46.427 --> 16:48.458
It's like I am just
throwing money away!

16:48.572 --> 16:49.712
Hey, hey, stop.

16:49.809 --> 16:50.825
Okay, listen, you're right.

16:51.768 --> 16:52.430
I am?

16:52.542 --> 16:56.036
Yeah. We don't have a lot
of extra money right now.

16:56.172 --> 16:58.080
Oh. Okay.

16:58.248 --> 16:59.936
But it's not your job
to worry about it.

17:00.254 --> 17:01.924
I'm the dad. It's my job.

17:02.133 --> 17:03.898
And I say "no"
to plenty of stuff.

17:04.133 --> 17:06.693
And this trip is a big deal.
You worked hard.

17:06.819 --> 17:08.443
So... we can do it.

17:08.556 --> 17:09.945
But your paycheck.

17:10.084 --> 17:11.840
If that's what you make
every two weeks,

17:11.971 --> 17:13.788
my trip is too expensive.

17:13.928 --> 17:15.510
Sue, you didn't look
close enough.

17:15.611 --> 17:16.897
I get paid every week.

17:17.005 --> 17:17.986
You do?

17:18.105 --> 17:18.972
Yeah.

17:19.082 --> 17:21.484
Now go get your costume.
The band needs its chicken.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.481
Are you sure?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.932
Go, honey.
Have a good time.

17:26.150 --> 17:28.989
I'm going to a band competition
in Cincinnati!

17:29.092 --> 17:31.234
How could I not?! Aah!
(Chuckles)

17:34.431 --> 17:36.095
(Sighs)

17:37.722 --> 17:39.399
You get paid every two weeks.

17:39.519 --> 17:40.535
Yeah.

17:40.774 --> 17:43.983
But just like that autographed
Justin Bieber hat we got her,

17:44.147 --> 17:45.274
she doesn't need to know.

17:46.355 --> 17:49.054
(Southern accent) It's a mighty
fine thing you done.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.409
Go get that fixed.

17:50.734 --> 17:51.541
(Normal voice) On my way.

18:11.946 --> 18:14.476
(Water flowing)

18:17.171 --> 18:18.581
(Scoffs) Are you kidding me?

18:18.709 --> 18:19.825
Brick, where did you get this?

18:19.927 --> 18:21.615
Oh, I took it
from the Glossners.

18:21.728 --> 18:23.827
<i>What?</i> And the whole time
I've been talking

18:23.938 --> 18:25.428
about the hose
that Rita thinks I stole,

18:25.551 --> 18:26.953
you didn't say anything?

18:28.405 --> 18:31.327
<i>Oh,</i> I thought you were
talking about panty hose.

18:47.055 --> 18:48.643
(Engine starts)

18:48.817 --> 18:50.080
Okay, look, we just have to
get rid of this

18:50.182 --> 18:51.542
before anybody finds out.

18:52.514 --> 18:53.900
Are you sure
it's even the Glossners'?

18:54.006 --> 18:55.776
I think they might have
stolen it from the Donahues.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.745
Yeah, well the Donahues
aren't gonna punch my boobs in,

18:57.858 --> 18:59.431
so we're getting
rid of it anyway.

18:59.642 --> 19:02.730
(Shifts gears) And, Brick, we
never speak of this again.

19:02.832 --> 19:05.553
Just like that autographed
X Games posters we got Axl.

19:05.784 --> 19:06.733
(Tires screech)

19:07.669 --> 19:10.179
Seriously, how does she
keep doing that?

19:17.911 --> 19:19.448
(Crows cawing)

19:22.151 --> 19:24.164
Where are you both
sneakin' off to?

19:24.823 --> 19:28.129
Just going to the dentist to get
my tooth fixed. (Chuckles)

19:28.295 --> 19:30.648
I did that once
on a cop's belt.

19:30.848 --> 19:32.042
(Laughs)

19:32.163 --> 19:33.698
That's really funny.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.465
Well, we should go.

19:38.701 --> 19:40.893
Nobody to watch him,
so he's gotta come with me.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.498
Not that our house
is empty right now.

19:42.657 --> 19:44.099
I know where my hose is.

19:45.109 --> 19:46.639
(Chuckles nervously) We don't.

19:46.883 --> 19:47.451
(High-pitched voice)
Whoop.

19:47.705 --> 19:48.772
(Whispering) Whoop.

19:49.661 --> 19:50.754
I'm lying.

19:51.526 --> 19:53.769
Somebody put it
back on my lawn.

19:54.535 --> 19:55.941
The orange one?

19:56.312 --> 19:58.754
Oh. Well... huh.

19:59.290 --> 20:01.519
Wow. That's great
that you got it back.

20:01.642 --> 20:03.281
When us Glossners
make a mistake,

20:03.367 --> 20:04.563
we admit it.

20:04.677 --> 20:06.346
That's why so many of us
is in jail.

20:06.485 --> 20:07.928
We've got integrity.

20:08.056 --> 20:12.317
Oh, yeah. That's-- that is
honorable. I appreciate it.

20:12.438 --> 20:14.960
So I want you all to come over
Sunday for a pool party.

20:15.266 --> 20:16.372
That's not necessary.

20:16.614 --> 20:18.782
I don't want to owe you nothing.
You're coming.

20:19.491 --> 20:22.584
Okay. Great.
(Chuckles) See you then.

20:23.392 --> 20:25.793
<i>I never did find out how that hose
got to Rita.</i> (Tires screech)

20:25.897 --> 20:27.686
<i>Probably some other</i>
<i>scared neighbor.</i>

20:27.874 --> 20:29.324
<i>But it's the Glossners,</i>

20:29.455 --> 20:31.526
<i>so Brick and I</i>
<i>made ours disappear,</i>

20:31.709 --> 20:32.764
<i>just in case.</i>

20:34.693 --> 20:37.034
<i>Brick and I never talked</i>
<i>about that night again.</i>

20:37.214 --> 20:39.818
<i>But he did have a lot to say</i>
<i>on another subject.</i>

20:39.938 --> 20:41.674
Does anyone have any questions?

20:41.801 --> 20:43.681
When chicks "want it,"

20:43.844 --> 20:47.204
do they want it right away,
or can I finish my book first?

20:47.311 --> 20:50.048
<i>He told the kids</i>
<i>everything Axl had told him.</i>

20:51.700 --> 20:53.778
<i>And the nurse told</i> us...

20:54.728 --> 20:56.038
<i>and we told Axl.</i>

20:56.157 --> 20:57.987
<i>At least he had the right info,</i>
<i>'cause it turned out,</i>

20:58.090 --> 20:59.856
<i>we hadn't talked</i>
<i>to any of the kids.</i>

21:00.039 --> 21:02.194
<i>Yep. You start going off</i>
<i>on a walk,</i>

21:02.293 --> 21:04.164
<i>and you never know</i>
<i>where it'll lead.</i>

21:04.262 --> 21:05.871
<i>If I hadn't gone</i>
<i>for a walk that day,</i>

21:05.985 --> 21:07.266
<i>I wouldn't have</i>
<i>chipped my tooth,</i>

21:07.398 --> 21:08.849
<i>which sent me</i>
<i>to the dentist's office,</i>

21:09.013 --> 21:09.952
<i>where I learned the girl</i>

21:10.053 --> 21:11.396
<i>that put the squirty thing</i>
<i>in my mouth</i>

21:11.508 --> 21:14.768
<i>is well paid and gets to wear</i>
<i>comfy shoes all day...</i>

21:14.872 --> 21:17.376
<i>which led me to finally settle</i>
<i>on my new career--</i>

21:17.526 --> 21:18.710
<i>dental assistant.</i>

21:18.825 --> 21:20.945
<i>'Cause believe me, if there's</i>
<i>one thing I've learned,</i>

21:21.073 --> 21:22.817
<i>teeth are important.</i>

21:23.207 --> 21:25.375
- Another beer?
- Sure.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.204
Then run over to your house
and get us some.

21:27.573 --> 21:29.040
I'll keep an eye on your kids.

21:29.781 --> 21:31.256
(Children shouting playfully)
