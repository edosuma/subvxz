her board the ship

them to New York.

07:25.458 --> 07:26.875

07:32.875 --> 07:34.750
Like when Hamilton was white?

07:34.834 --> 07:36.834
-After that.
-Okay.

07:36.917 --> 07:40.375
It would be 15 years before
Junious had the courage

07:40.458 --> 07:42.583
to ask for her hand.

07:42.667 --> 07:47.583
But her father said no,
and so, they eloped.

07:47.667 --> 07:51.583
Oh, they don't make love
stories like that anymore.

07:51.667 --> 07:52.834
(spits)

07:54.583 --> 07:57.125
As you can see,
we're each representing

07:57.208 --> 07:59.291
our newly-discovered
genetic history.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.417
(all chuckle)

08:00.500 --> 08:02.458
<i>Je m'appelle </i>Sophia.

08:02.542 --> 08:03.709
I'm 10% French.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.709
And I'm 60% Scottish.

08:05.792 --> 08:09.500
Well, turns out I'm related
to John Wayne Gacy,

08:09.583 --> 08:11.583
but I'm not gonna dress up
like that.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.333
Here's our genetic report.

08:13.417 --> 08:18.667
And here is the greatest
love story of all time.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.458
Junious and Wandy,

08:20.542 --> 08:21.667
my grandparents.

08:21.750 --> 08:22.875
HEATHER:
Huh.

08:22.959 --> 08:24.542
Well, that's weird.

08:24.625 --> 08:28.792
Wandy also had an uncle
named Junious, and he was

08:28.875 --> 08:31.458
born on the same day
as her husband.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.625
Oh, it was a family name.

08:33.709 --> 08:37.083
And he died on the same day
as her husband.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.583
Did she marry her uncle?

08:40.750 --> 08:42.250
No, don't be ridiculous.

08:42.333 --> 08:45.083
It's the greatest love story
of all time.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.959
He carried her off the boat.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.375
Because she was four months old.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.083
No! No, no, no, no, no.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.834
It was love!

08:52.917 --> 08:55.750
He-he taught her to walk,
he even spoon-fed her.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.667
They courted for 15 years.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.208
Yeah,
until she was 15 years old.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.750
No wonder her father
disapproved.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.250
Guy married his own niece.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.959
-(gasps)
-COLLEEN: Sam, that's like

09:06.041 --> 09:07.041
you marrying Uncle Matt.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.083
Oh... (stammers)

09:08.166 --> 09:10.125
So, we're the product of incest?

09:10.208 --> 09:12.834
Well, you are. (laughs)

09:12.917 --> 09:15.083
I guess this, uh,
means my mom and dad

09:15.166 --> 09:18.417
both wearing toupees isn't so
weird anymore, huh? (chuckles)

09:18.500 --> 09:20.166
No, it was a different time!

09:20.250 --> 09:22.834
He stole a baby and married it.

09:22.917 --> 09:23.917
He loved the baby!

09:24.041 --> 09:25.417
MATT:
Mom,

09:25.500 --> 09:27.333
are you <i>really </i>defending this?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.125
No.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.458
Give it back.

09:33.542 --> 09:37.125
It's just that it was
such a great love story,

09:37.208 --> 09:39.208
and I'm proud
of my incest and...

09:39.291 --> 09:40.667
No,

09:40.750 --> 09:41.959
I'm not proud of incest.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.166
It's just that,

09:43.250 --> 09:47.166
you know, DNA really sucks,

09:47.250 --> 09:49.750
because then
you find out incest.

09:49.834 --> 09:52.333
And so what's left for you?

09:55.417 --> 09:57.125
Well, best I was hoping for
was an explanation

09:57.208 --> 09:58.542
for Uncle Greg's tail.

09:58.625 --> 09:59.834
Think we found it.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.041
-Happy birthday.
-Oh!

10:08.125 --> 10:11.458
-Ooh! It's such a big box.
-(giggles) Mm-hmm.

10:11.542 --> 10:12.917
As my dad would say,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.709
-you can fit way more than
a human head in here.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.709
-Mm.

10:15.792 --> 10:16.750
What is it?

10:16.834 --> 10:18.083
(both squeal)

10:18.166 --> 10:19.667
(gasps)

10:19.750 --> 10:24.166
Oh, look, you gave me a book
of homemade coupons again.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.875
-Yeah.
-For chores

10:25.959 --> 10:28.166
and other silly, silly stuff.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.250
You just can't stop
giving me coupons as gifts.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.083
No way. You love 'em.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.333
Mm. Happy birthday.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.500
Thank you. Love you.

10:35.583 --> 10:37.709
Ugh.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.041
Classic Matt.

10:39.125 --> 10:41.166
Giving a gift
no one would ever use.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.917
Ugh. You know what?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.041
That all changes today.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.333
I'm gonna become the first
person in the world

10:47.417 --> 10:49.709
to actually cash
those coupons in.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.625
-Mm-hmm.
-(Greg whistles)

10:51.709 --> 10:53.000
Jen, have you seen my keys?

10:53.083 --> 10:55.291
Uh, Greg's whistling.
I got to go.

11:00.959 --> 11:03.333
I've decided it's time
to dive in

11:03.417 --> 11:05.792
and start using
those gift coupons.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.041
All right. What am I warming up,
the tub or the wax?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.583
'Cause I can get down
with either one.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.750
Ooh, you're gonna get down,
all right.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.000
With a little karaoke.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.917
I did not give you a coupon
for karaoke.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.375
No, but you gave me a coupon for

11:16.458 --> 11:17.625
"an adventure
of your own choosing,"

11:17.709 --> 11:19.208
and the choice has been made.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.417
-We'll do your hair in the car.
-But I don't like karaoke.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.417
That's 'cause you've only
done it in English.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.959
(singing in Korean)

11:29.083 --> 11:30.083
Hey!

11:30.166 --> 11:32.250
(continues singing in Korean)

11:32.333 --> 11:34.333
(both singing in Korean)

11:44.625 --> 11:46.625
COLLEEN:
Yay! This is the best.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.750
I can't believe I didn't
cash these coupons in sooner.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.875
I wish I could be
one of those people

11:49.959 --> 11:51.750
that ate all of my meals in bed.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.750
You're describing
a quadriplegic.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.417
Mmm, this is so good.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.917
Somebody order a sexy handyman?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.458
Yeah.

12:00.542 --> 12:01.959
The garbage disposal's clogged.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.917
-Mm-hmm.
-I'll be back in three hours.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.625
Mmm.

12:07.709 --> 12:10.041
That is amazing.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.834
Now work on that bunion.
Whittle it down.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.291
Yay.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.625
Oh.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.333
Mmm.

12:25.417 --> 12:26.959
Oh.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.375
Thank you, Mom.
I forgot what it was like

12:28.458 --> 12:29.834
to have someone
make breakfast for me.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.792
JOAN:
Aw, you're welcome, sweetie.

12:31.875 --> 12:34.667
Well, I guess I'm off
to do the dishes.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.792
Unless anybody wants to help me.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.291
No thanks, Joan.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.709
Joan, here.
Give this coupon to Matt.

12:41.792 --> 12:44.041
Then he'll do
any chores that you want

12:44.125 --> 12:45.792
in whatever outfit
that you want.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.625
Now, I prefer the French maid,
but I'm sure

12:47.709 --> 12:49.417
that you're gonna take it
in a different direction.

12:50.792 --> 12:53.000
I gave that coupon to you,
not to my mom.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.625
I know, and I'm giving it
to her.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.041
It's called regifting.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.375
Well, it's rude
and incredibly hurtful.

12:58.458 --> 13:00.333
Well, not as hurtful
as getting coupons

13:00.417 --> 13:02.166
for your birthday
instead of a gift.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.250
We can give coupons
for birthdays?

13:04.333 --> 13:06.291
Babe, if you can tell
me when my birthday is,

13:06.375 --> 13:07.542
you can give me a coupon.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.250
June. July.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.959
-Jewelry it is.
-That's right.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.875
I thought everybody
loved getting coupons.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.333
Coupons are literally
the worst gift

13:15.417 --> 13:16.583
you could ever give a person,

13:16.667 --> 13:17.792
and that's coming from a woman

13:17.875 --> 13:19.709
whose last present was
a flu shot.

13:19.792 --> 13:22.208
Now, that is a gift
that keeps on giving.

13:22.291 --> 13:24.375
Through flu season.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.166
30% of the time.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.583
Matt, it's not that we want you

13:27.667 --> 13:29.166
to spend more money on us.

13:29.250 --> 13:32.166
We just want you to, you know,
think about us a little.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.500
JOAN:
And luckily,

13:33.583 --> 13:34.959
you'll be able to do that

13:35.041 --> 13:36.542
while you're doing the dishes.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.041
Yeah,
and the French maid's outfit's

13:38.125 --> 13:40.458
up in the hall closet.

13:40.542 --> 13:42.709
Should be dry by now.

13:44.041 --> 13:46.625
You want the heels, let me know.

13:58.041 --> 13:59.625
Oh!

13:59.709 --> 14:02.291
Sorry. (chuckles)
I don't want to poke you.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.542
No, it's okay.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.291
TIM:
Boom!

14:05.375 --> 14:07.166
Right on the nipple.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.875
Oh! Babe, you think
my nipple is that high?

14:09.959 --> 14:11.542
Oh, honey.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.875
Guys, this is my prom,
not yours.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.250
I know. Sweetie, listen,

14:15.333 --> 14:17.125
we are here to chaperone,
okay? That is it.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.458
Yeah, tonight's all about you,
honey.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.834
Now you get out there,
you crazy kids.

14:21.917 --> 14:24.625
-(laughs)
-Come on.

14:24.709 --> 14:26.500
So the parents
can have a little fun.

14:26.583 --> 14:30.542
(gasps) Oh. I always fall
for the bad boys.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.291
Ah. Oh.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.709
I cannot believe that I get
to be at real prom with you.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.792
Oh, honey,
I am so in love with...

14:41.875 --> 14:43.959
Wayne Winger? (gasps)

14:44.041 --> 14:45.500
Oh!

14:45.583 --> 14:46.792
-Who's Wayne Winger?
-(yelps)

14:46.875 --> 14:49.834
He was only the most popular
guy in my high school.

14:49.917 --> 14:52.125
I mean, he was, like, the winner
of Battle of the Bands,

14:52.208 --> 14:53.709
he was prom king.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.500
He won class vice president,
and he only came in second

14:56.583 --> 14:58.125
because Janelle Swanson
had polio.

14:58.208 --> 14:59.750
I don't even think
that's a real thing.

14:59.834 --> 15:01.291
Why don't you just go say hi?

15:01.375 --> 15:04.125
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.458
He will never remember who I am.

15:05.542 --> 15:06.875
He was way too popular for me.
Okay?

15:06.959 --> 15:08.709
We talked, like, one time.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.750
He will have no idea
who this girl is.

15:10.834 --> 15:13.250
Heather Short.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.959
(chuckles)
You look exactly the same.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.959
It's me. It's Wayne Winger.

15:19.041 --> 15:20.041
Wayne... Wayne...

15:20.125 --> 15:22.375
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne W-Winger.
Wayne-w...

15:22.458 --> 15:25.667
Wayne Winger, right! Yes.
I haven't seen you since...

15:25.750 --> 15:27.625
-That night.
-Yeah. Whoa.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.291
-And then I shipped out.
-You did.

15:30.375 --> 15:31.500
Desert Storm one.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.542
-Oh, yeah.
-Military band.

15:33.625 --> 15:34.709
Mmm.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.625
Excuse me,
I have to go tune my axe.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.083
I like to keep
all my instruments

15:38.166 --> 15:39.291
in fine working order.

15:40.208 --> 15:42.834
Do not go away.

15:42.917 --> 15:45.375
Oh, no, I won't.
I won't. I won't.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.166
(whoops) (gasps)

15:47.250 --> 15:49.792
What was that about? You said
he only talked to you one time.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.834
Yes, the night that we had sex.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.250
Oh, my God, Tim,

15:53.333 --> 15:55.375
I cannot believe that
he remembers me. It just...

15:55.458 --> 15:57.208
It's Wayne Winger.

15:57.291 --> 16:00.291
Totally remembers me. Me!

16:03.291 --> 16:04.792
Can you help me
get my earring in?

16:04.875 --> 16:06.041
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.166
Yeah, if I can
remember correctly,

16:07.250 --> 16:08.500
you really knew how
to handle a stud.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.166
(high-pitched voice):
Hey, uh, let me help with this.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.583
I'm, uh...

16:11.667 --> 16:14.667
(normal voice):
I'm an ear doctor

16:11.667 --> 16:14.667
and her husband.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.750
Dr. Tim Hughes, it's actually
pronounced "Huge."

16:17.834 --> 16:19.959
Hello, North Tippet High!

16:20.041 --> 16:21.208
(crowd cheers)

16:22.500 --> 16:25.542
We are Wingz with a "Z"
for legal reasons.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.250
Are you ready to rock?

16:28.583 --> 16:30.583

16:43.083 --> 16:45.166
-Eh, he's not into me.
-No, no, no.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.875
I said you're still into him.

16:46.959 --> 16:49.917
(sighs) Oh...
I hate it when you get jealous.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.125
Jealous? Of who?

16:51.208 --> 16:52.583
-Wayne.
-(scoffs)

16:52.667 --> 16:54.875
(laughing):
Wayne? Wayne's dumb.

16:54.959 --> 16:56.375
Oh, come on, Tim.

16:56.458 --> 16:58.417
Wayne is not dumb, obviously.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.166
I mean, he's in a band, okay?

17:01.250 --> 17:04.250
You know what? Let's just...
let's not do this here.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.625
WAYNE:
♪ <i>Sat and waited,</i>

17:04.333 --> 17:06.625
<i>worried for you... </i>♪

17:06.709 --> 17:09.625
(sighs) What is up
with your dad?

17:09.709 --> 17:11.333
He thinks I like Wayne.

17:11.417 --> 17:13.375
Wayne Thompson?

17:13.458 --> 17:15.917
He's a ninth grader,
and you couldn't get him.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.250
SAMANTHA:
Really, Mom?

17:17.333 --> 17:19.291
I knew you guys would
make this night about you.

17:19.375 --> 17:21.417
What? We've been watching you
the whole time.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.834
You've been here, right?

17:22.917 --> 17:25.583
-Yeah, I've been having a blast.
-Good.

17:25.667 --> 17:28.291
-The lead guitarist keeps
licking his lips at you.

17:25.667 --> 17:28.291
-Really?

17:28.375 --> 17:29.750
And Ryan won't even dance
with me.

17:29.834 --> 17:31.709
-Why not?
-Because Dad stole him.

17:31.792 --> 17:33.250
He keeps calling him
"Rye Bread."

17:33.333 --> 17:34.625
This Wayne guy

17:34.709 --> 17:36.333
thinks he's so cool?

17:36.417 --> 17:38.041
Tell you what,
Heather's gonna change her tune

17:38.125 --> 17:40.083
as soon as the lease is up
on my minivan

17:40.166 --> 17:41.875
and I get a kick-ass sports car.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.291
You feel me, Rye Bread?

17:44.375 --> 17:46.750
-Yeah.
-All right, Tim, come on.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.041
Let's stop being a buzzkill

17:48.125 --> 17:49.792
and give Samantha
her date back, okay?

17:49.875 --> 17:53.667
I will, just as soon as my date
stops eye-banging Wayne.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.583
You did not just say that to me.

17:57.834 --> 18:00.542
-Come on, Sam, let's go.
-Really, Mom?

18:01.667 --> 18:02.667
Shouldn't your commitment

18:02.750 --> 18:04.583
to one another
for 20 years mean more

18:04.667 --> 18:07.041
than some really cool guy
from your wife's past?

18:08.583 --> 18:10.625
I mean, you won her heart.

18:10.709 --> 18:13.291
Isn't that what really matters,
Dr. Huge?

18:13.375 --> 18:16.542
You're a good kid, Ryan.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.417
Maybe the best.

18:20.542 --> 18:23.291
Your dad is behaving
like a child.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.959
He knows I wasn't
a virgin when I met him.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.500
Ew, you lost
your virginity to Wayne?

18:27.583 --> 18:29.166
I wasn't a virgin
when I met Wayne.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.500
I mean... (stammers) No.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.166
Derek Wilson lost his virginity

18:35.250 --> 18:36.709
to a wet toilet paper roll.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.750
I kind of have
a crush on him, though.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.208
Mom, you and Dad are both
acting like children.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.583
(sighs) You're right.

18:44.667 --> 18:48.625
You're right. I... Oh...

18:48.709 --> 18:51.208
I just got caught up

18:51.291 --> 18:52.875
in feeling like
a teenager again.

18:52.959 --> 18:54.542
It is such an exciting time.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.291
And when you grow up to be
a strong, beautiful woman,

18:57.375 --> 18:59.583
I want you to be able
to look back on tonight

18:59.667 --> 19:01.250
and have beautiful memories.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.458
-I'm sorry.
-Thanks, Mom.

19:04.542 --> 19:05.500
Yeah.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.166
But I won't have
anything to remember

19:07.250 --> 19:09.291
unless you let me go dance
with my boyfriend.

19:09.375 --> 19:12.250
-Okay, go, have fun.
-(Samantha giggles)

19:12.333 --> 19:15.458
(sighs)
Sam's kind of a bitch, huh?

19:19.667 --> 19:22.166
WAYNE:
All right,

19:19.667 --> 19:22.166
this next one goes out

19:22.250 --> 19:25.417
to a sexy little tiger
who's in the audience tonight.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.083
Just to be clear, I'm talking
about an adult chaperone

19:28.166 --> 19:29.750
and not a student.

19:35.583 --> 19:38.917
