WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:03.204
What are you doing,
babe?

00:03.271 --> 00:04.905
I got to get the kids up
for school.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.907
What? No!
Get some rest.

00:06.974 --> 00:10.010
Your man is home now.
I got you.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.813
Well, that's sweet, honey,
but it's a whole routine.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.483
I mean, Sara --
She's gonna call
you some names.

00:15.549 --> 00:16.850
I'm not gonna lie.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.687
She finds your weak spot,
and she just -- she digs in.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.022
And then Kendra
gets mad at Sara

00:22.090 --> 00:23.791
'cause she's making
too much noise,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.459
and Jack is, like,
a whole other story.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.927
Babe,
it's a 20-minute routine.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.396
I think
I can handle this.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.664
Okay, but you're gonna be
right back here

00:30.731 --> 00:31.732
asking meto do it.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.034
Oh, am I?
Mm-hmm.

00:35.103 --> 00:38.239
[Knock on door]

00:38.306 --> 00:41.475
Kendra. Sara.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.943
My little princesses,
time to get up.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.946
[Groans]
Leave me alone! I'm sleeping.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.948
Leave me alone.
I'm 21.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.049
[Air horn blares]

00:49.117 --> 00:50.551
[Screams]

00:50.618 --> 00:52.920
Dad!

00:52.986 --> 00:54.955
What the crap?!
Kids are up!

00:55.022 --> 00:57.825
[Air horn blares]

00:57.891 --> 01:02.896
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:02.963 --> 01:04.265
[Groans]

01:04.332 --> 01:06.967
Oh, look at my man's
whippin' up breakfast.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.302
Oh, yeah!

01:08.369 --> 01:10.671
I got to say, I'm not hating
the view from back here.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.005
You like it
when I whisk, huh?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.174
I do.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.276
It's mesmerizing,
like a lava lamp.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.610
[Chuckles]

01:16.677 --> 01:18.879
Let me break it down
for you, then, huh?
Ooh!

01:18.946 --> 01:21.382
Oh, honey, honey, honey,
now it's just lava.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.983
Yeah.
I felt it.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.518
Kendra, don't touch
my lacrosse bag!

01:24.585 --> 01:25.586
I'm serious.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.221
No, it's disgusting,
and it's getting washed.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.523
Okay, no, it isn't 'cause
we haven't lost in 10 games.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.924
There's a reason
for that.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.993
Yeah, because it stinks so bad
no one will cover you.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.262
All right, guys,
just Febreze it.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.063
Come on. Sit down.
Have some breakfast with me.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.098
No, Dad, I can't, okay?
I'm gonna be late for class,

01:38.166 --> 01:40.234
especially now that I have to
pull over and throw up.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.602
[Chuckles
sarcastically]

01:43.103 --> 01:45.573
Hey, buddy!
I'm making you some pancakes.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.041
And I'm gonna make them
in the shape of a T-Rex

01:48.108 --> 01:49.643
with the little arms
and everything.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.011
You're gonna love them,
all right?

01:51.078 --> 01:52.880
Okay? Hey!

01:52.946 --> 01:55.249
Hey, buddy!

01:55.316 --> 01:57.017
No kiss goodbye?

01:57.084 --> 01:59.420
What's going on
with this family?

01:59.487 --> 02:02.022
What are you doing?!

02:02.089 --> 02:05.426
It's like I shined a light
on a possum in a Dumpster.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.027
Please,
like I haven't watched you

02:07.094 --> 02:09.163
eat an entire Thanksgiving
dinner over the trash can.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.064
If your parents would have put
a chair at the table for me,

02:11.131 --> 02:12.600
I wouldn't have had to.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.603
Come on. Just settle in.
Have a pancake with me.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.737
I can't.
I got to go.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.272
I'm late.
I love you. Bye.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.107
Unbelievable.

02:22.109 --> 02:26.046
Oh, do I smell
some griddle cakes?

02:26.113 --> 02:27.948
[Chuckles]

02:28.015 --> 02:32.119
Oh, back in London, my Nana
used to make these for me.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.354
Yeah?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.323
Yeah,
and I remember on rainy days,

02:35.389 --> 02:37.658
I would hide
beneath the counter,

02:37.725 --> 02:39.493
and, uh,
I would reach out

02:39.560 --> 02:42.029
to try and catch
the -- the hot drippings.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.030
[Chuckles]

02:43.096 --> 02:44.698
But Nana knew
that I was there.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.201
She encouraged the --
Mr. Gable?

02:47.268 --> 02:50.271
**

02:54.675 --> 02:56.277
Okay, what --
w-what's he doing?

02:56.344 --> 02:57.845
I think
he's cleaning his pizza.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.480
Nope, just blotting off
the grease.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.515
What, do you think
you're better than us?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.050
I'm trying
to eat healthier.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.185
Yeah, well, it's coming off
super aggressive to the group.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.320
Yeah.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.821
Oh, hey, guys,
we're up on shuffleboard.

03:07.888 --> 03:08.956
Whoa.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.190
Hey, Kyle,
did you call your guy

03:10.258 --> 03:11.692
about the Billy Joel tickets
for Sunday night?

03:11.759 --> 03:13.894
Yeah. I called him,
I asked for five tickets,

03:13.961 --> 03:15.363
he laughed at me,
and hung up.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.097
So I think
they're totally sold out.

03:17.164 --> 03:21.101
Man, I've never seen him live.
I'd love to do that.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.270
All right,
so I guess we'll do,

03:22.336 --> 03:23.371
uh,
football at my house Sunday?

03:23.437 --> 03:25.072
Oh, wish I could.
I got a thing.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.674
What thing?
Family thing.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.476
Every year
around this time,

03:28.542 --> 03:30.544
we all go up to a cabin
in the Adirondacks,

03:30.611 --> 03:33.113
just a bunch of Motts running
around wild in the woods.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.682
[Chuckles]
It's the greatest.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.350
We even go
to the bathroom outside.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.852
How is that different
than at home?

03:38.919 --> 03:41.121
Because it's
a family tradition.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.991
The kids love it.
It keeps us all connected.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.159
Come on.
You got stuff
like that, right?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.028
Yeah, I mean, we --

03:48.095 --> 03:50.831
You know, we don't do the
bathroom thing, but we, uh --

03:50.898 --> 03:52.900
You know,
every time McDonald's
brings back the McRib,

03:52.966 --> 03:54.935
we definitely get together
as a family unit,

03:55.002 --> 03:57.705
and, uh,
it's pretty special.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.573
I'm getting another beer.
You in?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.443
No, no, I'm out of here.
You guys are useless.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.146
Come on. Do it.
Go, go, go, go!

04:06.213 --> 04:08.148
Aw, come on!
We're good.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.350
I gave him some story

04:09.417 --> 04:11.118
about wanting to
spend more time
with my family.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.686
[Chuckles]
He bought that?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.455
He didn't seem
that drunk to me.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.390
But -- But you really did
get the tickets?

04:16.457 --> 04:18.158
Oh, yeah,
five up front, boys.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.793
[Laughter]

04:19.860 --> 04:21.862
Kevin is going to
lose his mind.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.163
Yes!
Let me see the tickets.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.698
Well,
I-I-I don't havethem.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.167
I mean, I have them,
but I-I don't havethem.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.303
My guy has them.
And he's in Poughkeepsie.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.539
Whoa.
That's two hours away.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.140
It's not a problem.
I'll drive.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.808
We can all enjoy
each other's company.

04:34.875 --> 04:35.943
Why do we all have to go?

04:36.009 --> 04:37.177
This guy's
a little sketchy,

04:37.244 --> 04:38.479
and I could use
the backup

04:38.546 --> 04:42.916
in case this whole thing
goes sideways.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.184
Donna?!

04:44.251 --> 04:45.653
Donna?!

04:45.719 --> 04:47.388
[Whispering] Hey.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.122
Lower your voice.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.158
You're sitting on a bucket.
What are you doing?

04:51.224 --> 04:52.225
What does it look like
I'm doing?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.494
It looks like
you're on lunch break

04:53.561 --> 04:54.962
in the back
of a Chinese restaurant.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.931
Are you hiding
from the kids?

04:57.998 --> 04:59.066
And you.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.835
It's Friday night.
I'm -- I'm reading my book.

05:01.902 --> 05:02.836
What's the problem?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.204
This is the problem
right here,

05:04.271 --> 05:05.639
and this morning
with the kids.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.207
Nobody's sitting down
for breakfast.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.576
It's --
You know what it is?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.943
We have no traditions.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.311
Well, Ido.

05:11.379 --> 05:14.247
On Friday nights, I sit on
a bucket and I read my book.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.583
I mean, until now.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.751
Now I got to find
a new hiding spot.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.219
I'm telling you, we are
dropping the ball, all right?

05:19.286 --> 05:20.521
What?

05:20.588 --> 05:22.423
We -- Yes, we got to start
doing things together.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.624
Mott's family's
killing it.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.659
Oh, Mott.
Now it makes sense.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.128
Jolly Green Giant
gets in your ear,

05:28.195 --> 05:30.230
and there goes
my Friday night.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.666
I'm telling you, we're
gonna start doing things
together as a family.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.667
This is important.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.035
We do
tons of stuff together.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.103
Really?
Name some.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.005
Okay, um,
we go to mass.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.540
That's one.
Christmas.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.609
Technically,
that's mass.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.177
You get on these kicks,
and you're unstoppable.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.213
This isn't a kick!
Really?

05:46.279 --> 05:47.781
How is this
different from,

05:47.848 --> 05:51.218
"I'm gonna learn karate
and open up my own dojo"?

05:51.284 --> 05:54.488
I pulled a hammy.
It set me back a couple belts.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.624
Okay, well,
I know I promised

05:56.690 --> 05:58.025
that I'd never
bring thisup again...

05:58.091 --> 05:59.059
Not --

05:59.126 --> 06:00.461
...but do you remember...
Stop it.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.530
..."Let's grow our own"...
Donna, no! Nah!

06:02.596 --> 06:05.265
..."potatoes"?
[Groans]

06:05.332 --> 06:06.534
I told you
not to do that.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.802
Hey, you ruined our backyard,
and it cost $1,000

06:08.869 --> 06:10.971
to grow four potatoes
that turned out so weird

06:11.038 --> 06:12.406
that we were scared
to eat them!

06:12.473 --> 06:13.541
Okay, you know what?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.509
I love you,
but you have zero vision.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.578
Do you know how many things
you can make

06:17.645 --> 06:18.912
with one single potato?

06:18.979 --> 06:20.548
And here comes the list.
Yeah, I'm telling you --

06:20.614 --> 06:23.684
baked potatoes, French fries,
potato skins, hash browns.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.853
You want Italian?
You got gnocchi.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.320
Hey, you want
to eat healthy?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.556
Potato salad.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.190
And I'm not even mentioning

06:30.257 --> 06:32.259
the all-purpose
vehicle of spuds --

06:32.325 --> 06:34.227
the mashed potato.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.896
And I know
I'm forgetting one, too.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.297
Yeah,
you can also make vodka,

06:37.364 --> 06:38.932
which I would kill for
right now.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.834
No, that is not it.
Look, come on.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.736
Let's just do this.
We'll have fun.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.004
All right, all right,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.507
just -- just -- just --
just don't force things.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.576
I-I'm not gonna force it.
I promise you --

06:48.642 --> 06:50.778
Got it! Tater tots!
Boom!

06:50.844 --> 06:58.318
Chaka Khan!
Whoo!

06:58.385 --> 07:01.789
First family tradition --
the classic -- "Monopoly."

07:01.855 --> 07:04.692
[All complaining]

07:04.758 --> 07:06.627
Yeah, no -- Yes.
We're giving it a shot.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.828
"Monopoly."

07:07.895 --> 07:11.098
I must warn you,
I play at a very high level.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.901
Okay, well,
do you want to be banker?

07:13.967 --> 07:15.636
I'm pretty good
with money.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.237
I'll have to take
your word for that,

07:17.304 --> 07:19.139
considering I've never
seen you with any.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.474
Okay.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.142
Okay, Dad, are you sure
we should do this?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.410
Because last time
we played,

07:23.477 --> 07:24.878
Jack ended up with the thimble
stuck up his nose.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.279
I was smelling it.

07:26.346 --> 07:29.449
It happened.
Get over it.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.285
Well, I don't think that's
gonna be a problem because
there are no pieces.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.787
[All talking]

07:33.854 --> 07:35.556
No,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
It's okay! It's okay!

07:35.623 --> 07:37.290
Hey, look,
we don't need pieces.
What?

07:37.357 --> 07:39.426
We -- We will make our
own. Honey, you are
a set of car keys.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.329
Uh, Jack,
you are a cheese doodle.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.664
Do not smell it.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.566
Uh, Kendra,
you are gonna be

07:45.633 --> 07:48.168
Kenny Chesney's boot
from this magazine.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.938
And, Sara,
you are a Jets coaster.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.575
And, Chale, you are
a Jets coaster upside down.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.176
Babe, this is crazy.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.678
We're playing.
All right.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.479
Okay, we can play.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.414
Let's all just hope that
Sara doesn't start crying
like she always does.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.917
She'll be fine.
Okay, I wasn't crying,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.386
so say it one more time
and you'll regret it.
Okay, you know what?

08:06.453 --> 08:07.487
Get it over with
because you are

08:07.555 --> 08:08.355
being such a big brat.
I don't know why

08:10.057 --> 08:11.559
[Indistinct shouting]

08:15.663 --> 08:17.397
[Sighs]

08:17.464 --> 08:20.100
I know you're wondering
why game night
didn't work out.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.769
I'm not wondering that
at all.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.403
Well, here's why.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.039
Nobody says,
"Let's play 'Monopoly'."

08:26.106 --> 08:28.341
They say,
"Hey, power's out.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.477
We might as well
play 'Monopoly'."

08:30.544 --> 08:33.113
You literally said,
"Let's play 'Monopoly'."

08:33.180 --> 08:34.648
We can sit here all night
pointing
fingers at each other,

08:34.715 --> 08:36.850
but we need to find
a family tradition

08:36.917 --> 08:38.418
where we can all
get along!

08:38.485 --> 08:39.987
Okay, well,
that's not gonna work.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.488
I mean, Chale's living
in the garage.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.323
Kendra wantsto be living
in the garage,

08:43.390 --> 08:45.859
but instead, she's in a tiny
room with her baby sister.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.795
I mean,
tensions are gonna erupt.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.697
So let's work
that tension out.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.231
[Scoffs]
Well, what do you want to do?

08:51.298 --> 08:52.666
You gonna wrap their hands
in bubble wrap

08:52.733 --> 08:55.803
and just let the fists fly
like a Thunderdome?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.505
That's a little extreme,
okay?

08:59.740 --> 09:02.676
But you're close.

09:02.743 --> 09:07.214
Welcome to the first annual
Gable Bubble Ball Tournament.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.481
Dad, I can't move.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.384
No, it's okay, sweetie.
None of us can move.

09:11.451 --> 09:15.923
It's sort of like
you combine
soccer with an MRI.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.457
See, Chale gets it.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.026
Wait, Dad,
what are the teams?

09:19.092 --> 09:20.994
No teams. No rules.

09:21.061 --> 09:21.995
What?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.463
Ready? Go!
What?! Ohh!

09:23.530 --> 09:25.833
Aah!
Ow!

10:02.870 --> 10:03.804
Okay.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.505
He didn't get hurt.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.040
He bounced down a hill.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.608
Lightly.
He's fine.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.577
Well,
then, why did we take him
to the hospital, hmm?

10:10.644 --> 10:11.945
As a precaution --

10:12.012 --> 10:14.547
"pre" caution, which means
it's before caution.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.617
Mm-hmm. Then why did they
want to X-ray him?

10:17.685 --> 10:19.753
This is so crazy. 'Cause
they're already paying
the guy at the machine.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.154
What's he gonna do,
sit there in a lead vest

10:21.221 --> 10:22.589
listening to audio books
all day?

10:22.656 --> 10:23.957
Come on.
He's getting paid.

Press the button.
That's all.

Honey, look, I know that you
want to build
family traditions,

10:28.829 --> 10:31.765

organically over time.

I just -- I just wish
we had something.

You can't eat
this late because
you always get nightmares,

and then you wind up
kicking me in your sleep.

Not now.

for Billy Joel tickets, okay?

so many red flags here,

just to be clear,

12:18.839 --> 12:21.641
do we have to sit here
until we're all happy?

around this table,

a lotmore meatloaf.

3/4 of a mile in a beach ball,

butI didn't.

on that.

Now, when I was a kid,
we used to go
around the table,

12:46.733 --> 12:48.668
and we'd all say one thing
we were grateful for.

Oh, that's nice.
Chale: Mm.
Yeah.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.138
I am grateful
for cauliflower.

Because after staring death
in the face --

12:53.206 --> 12:54.574
Okay, Jack, Jack,
we -- we get it, buddy.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.143

hogging the ball
a little bit.

let's go with you.
What do you got in the tank?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.679

for the two years

13:01.214 --> 13:03.250
that Kendra
didn't live here.

to shower and read,

to be in Sara's box.

Okay, okay,
sorry I'm coordinated

13:11.491 --> 13:13.393
and I don't want to spend
my life in a library.

hear that? Sara knows
what a library is!

13:15.829 --> 13:16.763

that's not helping.

to step in here, please?

Yeah, I do. I'm tired
of every single one of you

doing stuff together,

look around,

the only family you got.

with school and work,

13:51.865 --> 13:54.034

on you.

drove you crazy.

Sorry I rubbed it
on your pillow, too.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.763
Oh, no, no, no. That's
all right. I switched it
with Jack's like a week ago.

all I wanted right here!

grab a beer.

is a little disturbing,

but this is awesome.

keep it flowing, okay?

You had to?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.009
That is so gross.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.111
My face was all...

14:39.947 --> 14:41.148
Honey,
did you see that?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.782
They were actually
communicating.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.418
That was incredible.
You were right.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.486
Of course I was right.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.787
And you know what?
We are not done.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.756

maybe some charades,

No, short story --

in a rest area

to bring us tickets.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.614
Yeah -- Billy Joel.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.383
We're taking you
to the Garden, guy!

15:16.449 --> 15:17.384
Yeah!

15:17.450 --> 15:18.851
But he -- he's sold out.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.554

at a rest stop
in Poughkeepsie.

we're picking you up in 20.

Yeah!

this hilarious game.

on your forehead

and you're a celebrity or
you guess it or I don't know.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you know,

15:41.774 --> 15:43.476
did you know
that tomorrow's a school day?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.478
I-I-I just didn't know.
I just was completely --

15:45.545 --> 15:47.480
The kids need their sleep.
I was thinking that.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.715
I was --
Honey, it's 6:30.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.250
Yeah, I know,
but they need 12 hours.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.852
You should know that as
a school nurse. That's
kind of embarrassing.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.887
I just feel like
I went too hard again.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.923
You know, I went
kind of full potato, and --

15:56.990 --> 15:58.858
No, no, no. We're having fun
in there. Come on.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.860
I know, but you can't
change them all in one night.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.295
It's like
when you get braces on.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.864
You don't have straight teeth
thatday.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.933
Okay, here's the game,
Mr. Gable.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.801
We're all celebrities.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.170
Right. Yeah.
We have a card on the head.
Everyone can see --

16:10.237 --> 16:11.804
You're Clint Eastwood,
okay?

16:11.871 --> 16:15.108
Mr. Gable
has won round one.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.477
I just think we need to
pull the plug on this now,

16:17.544 --> 16:18.878
you know,
for the family.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.180
Yeah,
it's probably best.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.881
It is. It is.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.751
Plus you went a little nuts
with the gravy down there.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.086
You might want
to change your shirt

16:26.153 --> 16:27.920
before you go see
Billy Joel.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.091
Billy who, now?

16:31.158 --> 16:34.327
Goody's wife just texted me
asking if I
wanted to get coffee

16:34.394 --> 16:37.897
because you guys
are all going to the concert.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.699
You guys
are getting coffee?!

16:39.766 --> 16:42.001
Oh, that's awesome.
We're all gonna have fun!

16:42.069 --> 16:44.904
That is so cool.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.906
What do you want me to do,
all right?

16:46.973 --> 16:48.775
They surprised me
with tickets.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.976
Honey,
I get it, all right?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.511
I mean,
you love Billy Joel.

16:51.578 --> 16:52.945
He's your favorite.
I get that.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.282
But you just accomplished

16:55.348 --> 16:57.317
something pretty special
in there.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.152
So...I don't know,

16:59.219 --> 17:01.688
where do you think
you should be?

17:04.224 --> 17:06.025
* Cadillac-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
*

17:06.093 --> 17:08.128
* You oughta know by now

17:08.195 --> 17:09.929
* You oughta know by now

17:09.996 --> 17:12.965
* If he can't drive
with a broken back *

17:13.032 --> 17:16.703
* At least he can polish
the fenders *

17:16.769 --> 17:21.208
* And it seems
such a waste of time *

17:21.274 --> 17:23.943
* If that's
what it's all about *

17:24.010 --> 17:29.949
* Mama, if that's movin' up,
then I'm *

17:30.016 --> 17:31.351
* Movin' out

17:31.418 --> 17:34.354
* Don't you know about
the new fashion, honey? *

17:34.421 --> 17:37.890
* All you need are looks
and a whole lotta money *

17:37.957 --> 17:41.961
* It's the next phase,
new wave,
dance craze, anyways *

17:42.028 --> 17:44.697
* It's still rock 'n' roll
to me *

17:44.764 --> 17:48.000
* Everybody's talkin' 'bout
the new sound *

17:48.067 --> 17:49.068
* Funny, but

17:49.136 --> 17:52.605
It's still rock 'n' roll
to me!

17:52.672 --> 17:55.675
[Cheers and applause]

18:09.322 --> 18:10.990
This is
a great tradition.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.692
[Chuckles]
Thank you.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.394
I wish you were
at the concert with me, Donna.

18:14.461 --> 18:15.995
I'm telling you,
Billy Joel was on fire.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.264
He closed
with "Piano Man."

18:17.330 --> 18:19.266
20,000 people just waving
cellphones in the air.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.467
They don't do
lighters anymore,

18:20.533 --> 18:21.634
you know?
No?

18:21.701 --> 18:23.470
Which is good.
You don't burn your fingers.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.104
Remember, you'd be like,
"Yeah! Aah."

18:26.539 --> 18:28.441
I think it's great
that you're so excited,

18:28.508 --> 18:31.010
but you should save all that
for next Sunday's supper.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.879
You know, it's gonna kill
at the table.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.583
And this is -- is more
of a quiet tradition.

18:36.649 --> 18:40.287
Wow, you get on the bucket
and you change.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.721
I'm just trying
to read my book.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.022
Yeah, I'm just trying
to tell you about my night

18:43.089 --> 18:44.924
with Billy Joel.
Oh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.359
I'll remember this

18:46.426 --> 18:48.027
next time you
want to talk about
"Downtown Abbey."

18:48.094 --> 18:49.829
It's "DowntonAbbey."
Yeah, whatever.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.464
You know what?
I'm out of here.
I don't need this stuff.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.966
Oh, legs are asleep.
Oh.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.902
Yep. That happens.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.338
Yep. Ohh!

18:58.405 --> 19:01.908
* Don't want no
sweet perfume *

19:01.974 --> 19:05.312
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

19:05.378 --> 19:07.580
* Do, do, do, do, do

19:07.647 --> 19:09.048
* Do, do, do, do

19:09.115 --> 19:12.752
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

19:12.819 --> 19:15.822
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

19:15.888 --> 19:17.724
* I just don't want no...
