02:05.250 --> 02:07.877
I think I'll make this the boys' room.

02:08.211 --> 02:13.216
- The master bedroom?
- Boys need, you know, space.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.969
- How old are they?
- Stephen's 10, Danny's 7.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.972
- Lucky kids.
- Lucky dad.

03:01.557 --> 03:06.269
- Is everything... It's my first house.
- Doyle, you're getting the loan.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.354
I'm not sure
I filled everything out correctly.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.022
You're approved.

03:10.691 --> 03:14.277
We'll have it done for you tomorrow.
Come by, say, 12:30.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.779
And we can sign off on this.

03:19.575 --> 03:23.077
- What about you?
- He bought all these instruments.

03:23.912 --> 03:29.417
Right. Did you know that
he built this hall? And a gallery,

03:29.501 --> 03:34.714
a shelter and a hospital in Mexico
and a lot of other really great things.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.551
I met Simon Dunne
when I was in college,

03:38.635 --> 03:43.389
I was tutoring kids in a local school,
kids who didn't have a lot of resources.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.183
And one of the people
I was working with

03:46.268 --> 03:50.062
said that her grandfather
liked to help children in need.

03:50.147 --> 03:55.318
Her name was Mina Dunne.
In fact, she's sitting right over here.

03:56.361 --> 04:00.865
So my friend and I went
to her grandfather and we said

04:00.949 --> 04:05.661
we have some kids who need
a playground. And we needed $1,000.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.079
He said, "Well, I'll tell you what.

04:07.164 --> 04:12.084
"You can't have $1,000
to build one playground,

04:12.586 --> 04:16.422
"you can have $10,000 to build 10."

04:16.505 --> 04:19.300
So we did. How long
have you been playing the violin?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.135
- Six years.
- How about you?

04:21.219 --> 04:24.055
I feel like champagne.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.934
I understand the idea of celebration.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.897
I see the bubbles in champagne

04:32.981 --> 04:36.692
as something good and beautiful,

04:37.778 --> 04:40.780
not part of my soul evaporating,

04:42.449 --> 04:44.283
but rising

04:46.161 --> 04:47.620
with joy.

04:49.414 --> 04:53.584
What I'm trying to say is,
I don't want champagne,

04:54.878 --> 04:58.005
I am champagne.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.053
It's great to be alive.
Thanks for letting me share.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.972
Thanks for sharing.

05:07.474 --> 05:11.060
- Mike.
- Hi, I'm Mike, and I'm an alcoholic.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.895
- Hi, Mike!
- Hi, Mike!

05:12.980 --> 05:15.189
I've been sober for 15 days.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.405
Hey, Mina. Mina! Mina, wait a second!

05:22.489 --> 05:26.367
My grandfather liked you for some
mysterious reasons of his own.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.120
Excuse me. That's the only reason
we allowed you to speak today.

05:29.204 --> 05:33.791
- Wait a minute. Mina, we're friends.
- We were friends, a long time ago.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.168
Mina, I owe you so much.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.297
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

05:42.175 --> 05:44.593
- See you in court.
- Mina, wait a second.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.845
It's okay, it's okay.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.471
- Mina!
- Let her go. Let it go.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.849
George, Melissa, how are you?

05:49.933 --> 05:51.684
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.686
...grant me the serenity

05:53.770 --> 05:55.104
to accept the things

05:55.188 --> 05:57.773
I cannot change and the wisdom

05:57.858 --> 05:59.525
to know the difference.

05:59.609 --> 06:00.818
So keep coming back.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.695
It works if you work it,

06:02.779 --> 06:05.114
so work it, you're worth it!

06:10.120 --> 06:12.121
- Morning, Julia.
- Hi, Gav.

06:12.664 --> 06:13.873
Morning, guys.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.710
...use of the premises by lessee,
then lessor and lessee shall...

06:17.794 --> 06:20.463
I don't deserve this.
I did absolutely nothing wrong,

06:20.547 --> 06:22.548
and now she just decides
that she's gonna hate me.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.051
- Just a second, Tom.
- No, nothing.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.511
Do your thing.
I just wanna tell you the news.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.389
You know,
I did absolutely nothing wrong.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.143
So what is it with
all this champagne stuff?

06:36.605 --> 06:39.732
- That was... That's just...
- It's a metaphor.

06:39.816 --> 06:44.820
Yeah, but I'm not drinking,
and that's what's important, right?

06:44.905 --> 06:49.075
Be careful with your metaphors, Doyle.
Just one drink, right?

06:49.159 --> 06:52.620
She's only mad at you,
because she can't be mad at him.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.790
He was your client.
She's not your client.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.416
Simon Dunne was your client.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.336
She's still just incredibly
angry about this.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.589
- Those are her feelings, not yours.
- I know that, Stephen.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.216
You got the documents,
they're all signed.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.426
Get in and get out, Gavin.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.763
- We didn't do anything wrong, though.
- Of course we didn't.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.308
File the papers and get out. Okay?

07:15.727 --> 07:16.811
Right.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.104
Okay, Mr. Warren.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.565
What you want is term insurance,
but you're not sure about the cost.

07:21.650 --> 07:25.111
What's important is that you be
realistic about what you need.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.654
All right, now, this particular policy

07:26.738 --> 07:30.825
is never gonna cost you
more than $15 a month. That's right.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.222
Ellen, call the courthouse
and tell them I'm gonna be late.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.516
You know what?
Just call Kaufman's office,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.977
and tell him that I called
to say that I'm gonna be late, okay?

07:58.061 --> 08:01.230
Your Honor,
I'm representing myself today,

08:01.648 --> 08:05.067
because I want you to hear
the sincerity of my words.

08:05.735 --> 08:09.989
Boys need their fathers.
Boys need their fathers.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.142
- You all right?
- Yeah, are you?

08:38.226 --> 08:41.061
Yeah. You got an insurance card?

08:41.645 --> 08:43.022
Yeah, sure.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.991
- Hello?
- We just got a call from the court.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.659
- They're looking for you.
- I had an accident.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.745
- Oh, no. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.455
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine. It's nothing.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.581
Nothing?

09:00.665 --> 09:01.916
- Who's that?
- It's no one.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.044
- This may be nothing to you...
- No, don't do that! Don't do that!

09:05.128 --> 09:06.837
- I'll do what I have to.
- I'm sorry. Not you.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.255
I have to do this right,
you know what I mean?

09:08.340 --> 09:11.050
Yes, I think so. I do.
Yes, hold on a second!

09:11.134 --> 09:12.927
- Clean, in all my actions.
- Gavin...

09:13.011 --> 09:15.721
- Hold on! Hold on for one second, okay?
- What do you want me to do?

09:15.805 --> 09:18.098
Call the court, tell them
that I'm on my way, all right?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.893
- Okay.
- Okay, tell them I'm on the steps.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.020
- Okay. Thank you.
- It's only gonna take five minutes.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.438
I gotta be somewhere
like five minutes ago.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.691
You know, you really should keep
your card in your glove compartment,

09:27.776 --> 09:29.735
- and not your briefcase.
- That's not what I'm looking for.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.947
Come on! Shit.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.866
- Thank you. All right, thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:35.951 --> 09:39.078
Thank you. Very nice of you. Okay.
Listen. Tell you what.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.414
I'm gonna write you a blank check,
and you just get your car fixed...

09:42.499 --> 09:44.291
- No, no, no.
- I trust you.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.585
- I don't want your check, man.
- You have an honest face.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.587
- Don't worry about it.
- I want to do this right.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.965
- Come on! Please! I gotta go!
- I gotta be someplace else, too!

09:51.049 --> 09:54.134
It's important to me that we do this right.
It should be important to you, too.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.762
That's it. I'm sorry. I gotta go.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.430
- You're sorry what?
- I gotta go, man. I'm late.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.266
- I have to go.
- I've gotta be somewhere, too, man!

10:00.350 --> 10:01.392
- Well, can I get a lift?
- I'm sorry.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.103
Where are you going, man? Yo, man,
don't leave me out here like this!

10:04.187 --> 10:07.481
- Sorry, better luck next time.
- Better luck...

10:07.565 --> 10:10.526
Hey! Hey, you're leaving
the scene of an accident!

10:49.232 --> 10:53.527
Your Honor, I'm sorry I'm late.
I was in a traffic accident.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.280
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Your Honor.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.324
- Was anyone hurt?
- No, Your Honor.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.576
Then will Mr. Kaufman begin?

11:03.872 --> 11:07.499
Your Honor, since its inception,
the Simon Dunne Foundation

11:07.584 --> 11:11.045
was managed by Mr. Dunne
and a board of trustees,

11:11.129 --> 11:14.631
which included his granddaughter,
my client, Mina Dunne.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.594
Upon his death,
that board was disbanded.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.139
We want to know why.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.311
Well, it was on instructions
from my client, Your Honor.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.356
Why would he do that?
These people were his friends.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.024
They were his friends,
they were wonderful people

11:32.108 --> 11:33.609
who loved kids and music,

11:33.693 --> 11:37.237
but they just weren't qualified
to manage a $100-million foundation.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.365
- That's why he signed...
- Your Honor, please.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.574
Address the court, Counselor.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.744
Simon Dunne signed
a power of appointment appointing

11:43.828 --> 11:47.748
Walter Arnell and Stephen Delano
sole trustees of the foundation.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.209
He was old
and he was taken advantage of.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.711
You took advantage of him, Gavin.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.880
Now you're charging a crime,
Ms. Dunne,

11:54.964 --> 11:57.216
and this is probate court,
not criminal court.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.718
Mr. Kaufman,
does your client understand?

11:59.803 --> 12:01.512
She does, Your Honor.

12:01.596 --> 12:05.391
Your Honor, I'm not here
to debate everyone's opinion

12:05.475 --> 12:07.476
about Simon Dunne's intention.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.688
I'm here to present some papers to the
court which are signed by Mr. Dunne.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.148
They've all been notarized.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.193
And furthermore, they direct
the foundation to be administered

12:16.277 --> 12:19.988
in precisely the way which Mr. Dunne,

12:20.073 --> 12:23.742
not his granddaughter, intended.
Please the court?

12:23.827 --> 12:26.453
- What do you got?
- Trust agreement.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.498
Tax exemption.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.960
Power of appointment.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.013
- Mr. Banek?
- Sorry.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.683
Mr. Banek?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.653
- I made a mistake.
- What mistake?

13:01.364 --> 13:04.491
This morning, after the accident,
by the side of the road,

13:04.576 --> 13:08.662
we were exchanging
insurance information,

13:08.746 --> 13:13.292
and I used the file folder to, you know...

13:13.376 --> 13:14.960
To, you know...

13:15.044 --> 13:18.964
- No, I don't know.
- To write my name on, and address.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.883
And I gave it to him.

13:21.843 --> 13:25.971
I just wasn't thinking clearly, I guess.
Must've been the accident.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.890
Did you get his name?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.059
Did I get his...
Yes, of course I got his name.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.686
Let's call him.

13:33.897 --> 13:38.275
As I... If memory serves, Your Honor,
I believe he's not in.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.068
How do you know?

13:40.153 --> 13:44.031
He made some reference
to the fact that he was feeling hurried,

13:44.115 --> 13:47.659
because he had to be
at an appointment of some sort.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.371
- Call his number and leave a message.
- Yes, of course, Your Honor, I will.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.627
- Your Honor?
- Yes, Mr. Kaufman?

13:56.711 --> 13:58.962
- May I make a suggestion?
- Yes.

13:59.881 --> 14:03.759
I'm in no hurry, and I know
how bad a person feels after a...

14:03.843 --> 14:06.512
- A car crash, right?
- Yeah. Thanks, Terry.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.972
No, don't mention it.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.769
So, Gavin, when the man,
whose name you don't know,

14:14.145 --> 14:16.980
gets out of the meeting
that you say he's in,

14:17.065 --> 14:20.400
would you call him at the number
that you think is in your car,

14:20.485 --> 14:23.695
so that we can have the document
that you assure us gives us the proof

14:23.780 --> 14:26.657
that the senior partners of your law firm
really do control

14:26.741 --> 14:29.034
the money Simon Dunne
left to the children of New York State?

14:29.118 --> 14:32.037
Doesn't matter anyway. He'll have
a copy. He'll bring the copy in.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.998
A piece of paper with
an original signature on it

14:35.083 --> 14:37.417
still has great magical power.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.212
Without that piece of paper
with the signature,

14:40.296 --> 14:42.798
Ms. Dunne can sue
that law firm for fraud,

14:42.882 --> 14:44.550
and possibly even send you

14:44.634 --> 14:47.761
and the other members
of your law firm, to jail.

14:48.763 --> 14:53.934
Mr. Banek, find your man and bring me
back that file by the end of the day.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.937
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you. Next case.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.731
Hold on, sir.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.110
- Put your hands up, please.
- Arms out to the sides.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.112
Wait. Hold on a second.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.448
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.550
- Dad!
- Hey, guys.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.344
- You're really late. Mom went in already.
- Okay, okay.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.430
- What's in the bag?
- What bag?

15:31.514 --> 15:34.933
- Daddy!
- This bag. It's a present for the judge.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.060
I want a present! I want a present!

15:37.145 --> 15:40.022
- You shouldn't lie to him, Dad.
- Okay, okay.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.401
I'd never give a judge
such a cool present.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.695
Happy birthday yesterday.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.489
Listen to me, guys.
Everything's gonna be better.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.825
- I bought a house.
- In Oregon?

15:51.909 --> 15:56.246
- No, in Queens.
- Mommy says we're moving to Oregon.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.914
Now you don't have to.
That's why I bought the house.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.750
So you don't have to move to Oregon.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.210
Are you gonna live there with us?

16:04.714 --> 16:06.882
See what the judge says, okay?

16:06.966 --> 16:10.135
The court denies the motion
for joint custody,

16:10.219 --> 16:12.554
and awards sole custody of the children

16:12.639 --> 16:13.930
- to their mother.
- No! No! Wait! Please!

16:14.015 --> 16:16.433
Your Honor, Ms. Gipson is moving
to Oregon to start a new job.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.810
Weekly visitations with Mr. Gipson
are gonna be impossible.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.146
- So noted. File with the court clerk.
- No, wait. Hold it!

16:21.230 --> 16:26.026
Your Honor... Your Honor, I know
I'm late, but someone hit my car.

16:26.110 --> 16:30.572
Now... See, look here.
This is evidence, new evidence.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.908
I have a new plan for joint custody.
It's all right here.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.494
Well, Mr. Gipson, you are late,
and the hearing has been conducted.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.663
- But I had an accident.
- Your Honor, are we free to go?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.164
No, I'm not done yet!

16:39.248 --> 16:40.999
- The court ruled, Mr. Gipson.
- But I wasn't here!

16:41.084 --> 16:42.376
- The court ruled.
- No!

16:42.460 --> 16:46.296
- Val... Valerie, I bought you a house.
- It's too late, Your Honor.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.799
No, it's not too late! It's 20 minutes.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.510
It's just 20 minutes,
20 minutes can't be too late.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.847
Valerie, please, don't let 20 minutes
stand in the way of what I'm trying to do!

16:55.932 --> 16:56.932
Please don't start.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.350
- Don't talk to him.
- No!

16:58.434 --> 17:00.185
Mr. Gipson, would you
please approach the bench?

17:00.269 --> 17:01.853
- Your Honor, can we leave now?
- Valerie... No.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.146
- Yes.
- No!

17:03.231 --> 17:04.856
Valerie, can't we talk?
Valerie, can't we talk?

17:04.941 --> 17:07.025
- Mr. Gipson?
- Valerie...

17:07.109 --> 17:09.944
Mr. Gipson, come here for a moment.
Please?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.571
Emotions run high in here.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.199
Now, if this weren't a divorce court,

17:14.282 --> 17:16.410
the way you just yelled
in my courtroom...

17:16.493 --> 17:17.868
- I'm sorry.
- Of course you are.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.872
You have children, Mr. Gipson.
Keep them in front of you.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.876
I just wanted to tell my wife
I got her a house for the children.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.713
- When?
- Well, I have it all right here.

17:27.797 --> 17:28.797
That's my plan.

17:28.881 --> 17:33.385
I found a house for Valerie and for
the boys, and they don't have to move.

17:33.845 --> 17:36.054
This is what I wanted to say.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.807
"Boys need their fathers.

17:39.225 --> 17:43.562
"The streets of this world are lonely
for boys without their fathers.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.565
"If I have made mistakes
and I have grown,

17:46.649 --> 17:49.901
"and I have recognized those mistakes. "

17:49.986 --> 17:51.820
What kind of a house?

17:52.864 --> 17:55.532
It's not a big house,
and it's not in great shape.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.701
But I can fix it. I can make it work.

17:57.785 --> 18:02.914
And there's a space for...
Well, if she'll have me back.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.084
There's a place for me, too.
But I'm not asking for that right now.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.503
I'm... I'm just asking
that she not take the boys

18:08.588 --> 18:09.963
and move halfway across the world!

18:10.047 --> 18:12.632
When they're settled, you can
arrange visitations with your children.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.259
Oregon is not
the other side of the world.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.721
It is to me! I want my family.
I want my boys.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.391
I had an accident. This...
This guy hit me on the FDR.

18:21.476 --> 18:25.145
He... He cut me off! I wanted to be here!

18:25.229 --> 18:27.230
If this was my marriage
and it was this important to me,

18:27.315 --> 18:30.609
I would have been here on time.
Everyone was here on time except you.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.652
Next case. Thank you.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.906
- Docket 718.
- Thanks.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.617
Counselor, step up, please.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.787
- How is everybody today?
- Good morning, Your Honor.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.413
Good morning, nice to see you again.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.393
It's not gonna help me
pay my electric bill.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.812
I'm not making any money
sitting in court.

19:06.896 --> 19:07.896
I'm going to court.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.272
I've been sitting in court
every single day.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.066
I'm not making any money.

20:04.829 --> 20:08.456
- Hello?
- If you and I had gotten caught

20:09.292 --> 20:10.959
before we stopped,

20:12.211 --> 20:16.006
and my wife found out,
and I left the law,

20:17.300 --> 20:20.176
and you died in a horrible accident
at sea,

20:21.470 --> 20:24.514
I would be better off than I am right now.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.017
What happened?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.896
He wouldn't take a check.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.774
He said he wanted
to be clean in all his actions.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.694
- The judge wouldn't take a check?
- The guy.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.196
- What guy?
- What day is today?

20:40.281 --> 20:42.782
Friday. Actually, it's Good Friday.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.077
- Good Friday. What's good about it?
- Gavin, what's going on?

20:46.162 --> 20:50.916
I know what's good about it.
My file's walking down the street.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.042
Gavin...

20:52.501 --> 20:54.711
Hey! Hey!

20:56.839 --> 20:59.257
Hey! Hey!

20:59.342 --> 21:00.842
Excuse me. Hey!

21:00.927 --> 21:03.053
Listen, man, you don't know me. I know.

21:03.137 --> 21:07.140
And you don't have to believe me,
but that was not like me today.

21:07.433 --> 21:11.227
I'm just so...
I'm so grateful, you know, just to God!

21:11.312 --> 21:14.189
And right here in front
of the Lord's house.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.901
Come on. Hop in. Get in the car.
Get out of the rain.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.363
I'm... I'm... My name's Gavin Banek.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.159
Doyle Gipson.

21:26.243 --> 21:29.496
Hey, listen, Doyle.
That is not what I'm like, this morning.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.624
That really isn't. That's not who I am.
I mean it. I'm a lawyer.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.585
I should never have left the scene
of an accident. I should know better.

21:39.548 --> 21:44.386
My file, did you find it?
I had an orange file.

21:46.055 --> 21:50.475
It was in my briefcase. I thought
maybe it fell out and you picked it up.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.854
Do you have it? Did you get it?

21:56.899 --> 22:00.610
You said, "Better luck next time. "
I said, "Give me a lift,"

22:00.820 --> 22:03.822
you said, "Better luck next time,"
and just...

22:06.575 --> 22:11.496
"Better luck next time"? I said that?
Listen, sir, please.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.749
I have no excuse for my behavior,
and I am sorry.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.918
I don't know what I can do
to make it up to you, except...

22:17.003 --> 22:19.129
I will buy you a new car.

22:22.008 --> 22:25.260
Money. You... You think I want money?

22:26.262 --> 22:28.555
What I want is my morning back.

22:29.890 --> 22:34.602
I need you to give my time back to me.
Can you give me back my time?

22:35.438 --> 22:39.065
Can you give my time back to me, huh?
Can you?

22:39.150 --> 22:42.444
Whoa! Wait a minute! Whoa! All right!

22:42.528 --> 22:45.238
So she won't move to Oregon!
So she won't take the boys!

22:45.322 --> 22:48.575
So they'll move into the house,
so I can be a father!

22:48.659 --> 22:51.202
Just 20 minutes! Can you give me that?

22:51.287 --> 22:53.872
I wish I could, man. I wish I could.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.584
I wish I could.

23:00.171 --> 23:03.048
Doyle, wait a minute. Wait.
Do you have the file?

23:03.132 --> 23:05.133
Doyle, you got the file?

23:05.634 --> 23:10.555
Wait a minute! Doyle, wait a minute!
Doyle, do you have the file? I'm sorry!

23:10.639 --> 23:12.390
I don't have your file! I threw it away!

23:12.475 --> 23:14.976
- What do you mean?
- I threw it away!

24:02.817 --> 24:05.819
- Hey. How did it go?
- Hey, guys.

24:11.158 --> 24:14.327
Well, Kaufman did some tap dancing.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.707
But once I filed the papers,
what was he gonna do?

24:20.376 --> 24:22.627
The guy squeaked like a mouse.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.879
I love it when they squeak.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.842
Yeah, I mean, we have the power
of appointment, so God's on our side.

24:32.346 --> 24:36.808
Hey, I'm going over to Southeast Harbor
tomorrow to look at a boat.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.396
- Hinckley 51.
-51-footer, huh? It's a tough life.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.607
You are not quite ready
for a 51-footer yet.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.484
Right.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.903
But as soon as I take delivery on her,

24:48.988 --> 24:52.282
I want... I want you and Cynthia
to have China Bird.

25:00.541 --> 25:01.749
Stephen, I don't know what to say.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.209
You don't have to say anything.
I'm saying it.

25:03.294 --> 25:06.671
I'm saying thank you
to my partner and my son-in-law.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.509
And my friend.

25:14.513 --> 25:18.558
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.105
Thank you.

25:25.191 --> 25:29.194
So I have a couple more interviews
I gotta bang out down the hall,

25:29.278 --> 25:32.864
so I'm gonna go back down there
and do some work.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.115
Great.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.910
Okay.

25:38.454 --> 25:42.373
- All right. Well, so long. All right.
- See you.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.468
- How you doing, Kate?
- Hey, Gavin.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.804
- Well?
- Hey.

25:58.140 --> 26:01.017
- So how'd it go?
- In and out. Easy-peasy.

26:01.101 --> 26:04.103
What do we...
What kind of people we have here?

26:04.188 --> 26:05.480
This is Sarah Windsor.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.898
- Hello. It's a pleasure.
- Hi, Sarah.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.484
- Tyler Cohen.
- Tyler, how you doing?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.277
- Who's up first?
- Ms. Windsor.

26:11.362 --> 26:17.325
Sarah Windsor, come on down!
Have a seat, please. And who are you?

26:18.285 --> 26:20.203
- Sarah Windsor.
- Not the nametag.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.039
I mean, who are you, as in
what have you been doing?

26:23.123 --> 26:25.291
Why do you want to be a lawyer?
Why do you want to work here?

26:25.376 --> 26:30.713
Well, I went to St. Paul's,
I did my undergraduate work at Yale,

26:30.798 --> 26:33.383
and now I'm finishing at Yale Law.

26:33.467 --> 26:37.262
I clerked last summer for
the California State Supreme Court.

26:37.471 --> 26:41.766
The reason I chose law is that my father
was District Attorney of San Francisco.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.560
- Really?
- I've always been interested in the law

26:44.645 --> 26:48.314
and politics,
and I was an economics major.

26:48.399 --> 26:53.403
This firm is particularly strong in
municipal finance law and public policy,

26:53.487 --> 26:55.196
which is the area

26:55.531 --> 26:58.574
I'm hoping to explore.

26:58.867 --> 27:03.997
Although, I gotta tell you,
I do have an eye on public service.

27:04.540 --> 27:07.125
I know how much this firm
supports pro bono work,

27:07.209 --> 27:11.045
and I'd love to help on
a death penalty defense for the poor.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.263
Why didn't I just give him
my insurance card?

27:20.347 --> 27:21.723
I'm sorry?

27:22.141 --> 27:25.810
I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's my fault.

27:26.562 --> 27:30.315
Excuse me. Gavin?
This really weird fax just came in.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.568
- I think you should look at it.
- Okay. Thank you.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.738
Do you know what it means?

27:45.247 --> 27:49.167
Michelle, I gotta talk to you. Michelle!

27:49.251 --> 27:50.710
Just a second. What the hell...

27:50.794 --> 27:54.005
Read this! It's from the file.
He's got the file.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.972
Help me.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.026
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.031
Can I have a

28:26.080 --> 28:28.247
- bourbon, straight up?
- Sure.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.018
Can I have a twist, please?

29:02.074 --> 29:06.494
I'm not a partner here.
That actually doesn't bother me.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.956
Partners have to bring in business.
I just gotta do my job.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.667
If I don't like it here, I can leave.

29:13.168 --> 29:16.629
- What's not to like?
- Watching you become one of them.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.760
I always thought you were
cutting a pretty big corner

29:22.845 --> 29:25.680
by convincing a dying old man
to sign a power of appointment.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.223
It wasn't like that.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.143
- Are you sure it wasn't like that?
- Of course I'm sure.

29:37.526 --> 29:38.776
What?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.073
He was in bad shape
when I went to see him.

29:44.158 --> 29:47.618
- I mean, it was... Maybe he didn't...
- Maybe?

29:49.037 --> 29:52.957
- Maybe he didn't understand exactly.
- Didn't understand exactly?

29:53.041 --> 29:55.460
He didn't know exactly
what he was signing.

29:55.544 --> 30:00.798
But Walter and Stephen said that
Simon put too much faith in his friends

30:00.883 --> 30:06.554
and the board was in his pocket,
and it was better for the foundation

30:06.638 --> 30:08.514
if we could just help control
and manage the money.

30:08.599 --> 30:10.516
- Delano said that?
- Yes.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.227
- Doesn't that sound reasonable?
- What's that supposed to mean?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.813
That means that without this file,

30:15.898 --> 30:19.150
you'll be in more trouble than
your father-in-law and his partner.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.611
You're the attorney of record.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.781
You could actually go to jail for this.
You need that file.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.910
What am I gonna do?

30:36.168 --> 30:37.793
There's this guy.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.796
He...

30:41.632 --> 30:45.301
He helps out with things
that need helping out.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.095
Like what?

30:49.306 --> 30:54.852
Like things, like getting people
to do things that you want them to do,

30:54.937 --> 30:57.855
when they don't necessarily
want to do them.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.360
Where is he?

31:08.534 --> 31:12.328
Michelle, I need help.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.498
Did you really believe it served
Simon Dunne to sign those papers

31:15.582 --> 31:17.041
- when he was too weak to read them?
- Of course.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.794
I wouldn't have done it otherwise. Yes!

31:21.463 --> 31:24.131
- Yes, I did.
- Do you want what's right?

31:24.675 --> 31:28.094
- Of course I do.
- And what's right is your job?

31:28.178 --> 31:30.096
Your wife?

31:31.265 --> 31:32.640
Your life?

31:35.852 --> 31:36.978
Yes.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.319
Where is he?

31:54.663 --> 31:56.581
- Hi.
- Don't go anywhere.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.459
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going out.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.422
I'm in a bar.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.842
You want company?

32:09.011 --> 32:10.052
No.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.514
That champagne feeling
gave you a hangover.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.183
Are you drinking?

32:21.356 --> 32:22.648
No.

32:26.737 --> 32:31.032
- What happened in court today?
- I'm in a bar. What's that tell you?

32:31.700 --> 32:34.327
It tells me that you're really angry.

32:35.412 --> 32:40.207
And that anger has gotten you into the
one place in the world you shouldn't be.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.587
Come on, leave that bar.

32:48.008 --> 32:49.925
Come on, leave the bar.

32:54.264 --> 32:55.598
I'm sorry.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.928
Can I have a Coke, please?

33:43.021 --> 33:44.271
Come on in.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.191
Okay, look, you tell Roberta

33:47.275 --> 33:51.237
that I said one cookie
before lunch is okay.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.698
Get better.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.784
- Mr. Banek.
- Are you Mr. Finch?

33:56.868 --> 33:59.203
- How are you?
- How are you doing?

34:00.664 --> 34:04.583
- You look nervous.
- Yeah, a little bit, I guess.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.585
Don't be. Have a seat.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.090
Who's your God?

34:12.259 --> 34:14.635
- Now, or hall of fame?
- Whenever.

34:15.637 --> 34:19.014
Well, I'd say it's the guy
who did the Volkswagen ad.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.306
You know, the one where the cop is

34:20.391 --> 34:22.059
giving a speeding ticket
to a guy in a Bug.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.393
Classic. Classic. Classic.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.813
Doyle Gipson.

34:26.690 --> 34:29.190
Shouldn't have told you he was
in insurance. Makes it too easy.

34:29.275 --> 34:33.279
I tell my clients, "Never tell
anyone anything about yourself. "

34:35.197 --> 34:38.576
Yeah,
here's his state insurance license.

34:38.659 --> 34:44.915
And that gives me his social security
number, which gives me everything.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.168
- You don't fucking know.
- I do know.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.335
- It's the one with the little kids.
- The little kids, yeah.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.880
He's sitting around, you know.

34:50.964 --> 34:54.550
Little... I don't know what he is.
Like, an Indian kid.

34:54.634 --> 34:57.762
Cute little black kid.
He's like, "I'm Tiger Woods. "

34:57.846 --> 34:59.180
"I'm Tiger Woods. "

35:02.017 --> 35:04.310
You had a fender-bender,
and the other guy's going postal.

35:04.394 --> 35:05.686
That's not the way to do things.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.939
I don't wanna kill anybody,
you know what I mean?

35:10.734 --> 35:15.529
I've just never done
this kind of thing before.

35:15.864 --> 35:19.867
- What kind of thing is that?
- I just want my file back, you know.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.747
You'll get your file back.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.750
How, exactly?

35:28.502 --> 35:33.297
It's like the dog collar that gives a little
electric shock when the dog barks.

35:34.549 --> 35:38.511
You don't kill the dog.
You just want the dog to settle down.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.598
Now we're torturing an animal?
I mean...

35:43.308 --> 35:45.434
We're all set. May I?

35:50.982 --> 35:52.900
Is there any other way?

35:53.693 --> 35:57.613
Well, sure, call him up
and just be nice to him.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.578
All right. Do it.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.916
- You guys are in advertising, right?
- Yeah. You, too?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.085
No, but...

36:12.504 --> 36:16.131
I hope you don't mind, but I was
intrigued by your conversation.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.926
I just thought you were in advertising.

36:19.553 --> 36:24.014
So I wanna give you my dream version
of a Tiger Woods commercial, okay?

36:25.517 --> 36:27.768
- Go ahead.
- By all means, yeah.

36:28.144 --> 36:31.105
There's this black guy on a golf course.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.401
And all these people are trying
to get him to caddy for them,

36:35.485 --> 36:37.236
but he's not a caddy.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.446
He's just a guy trying
to play a round of golf.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.868
Then these guys give him
a five-dollar bill

36:43.952 --> 36:48.163
and tell him to go to the clubhouse
and get them cigarettes and beer.

36:49.583 --> 36:52.251
So off he goes. Home.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.880
To his wife and to their little son,

36:55.964 --> 36:58.132
who he teaches to play golf.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.676
We see all the other
little boys playing hopscotch,

37:00.760 --> 37:03.637
while little Tiger practices
on the putting green.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.931
You see all the other kids
eating ice cream,

37:06.016 --> 37:09.268
while Tiger practices
hitting long balls in the rain,

37:09.352 --> 37:11.353
while his father shows him how.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.938
And we fade up

37:14.024 --> 37:18.527
to Tiger winning four grand slams
in a row

37:19.571 --> 37:23.824
and becoming the greatest golfer
to ever pick up a nine iron.

37:24.576 --> 37:25.951
- And we end on his father...
- Goodbye.

37:28.330 --> 37:32.833
...in the crowd on the sidelines,
and Tiger giving him the trophies.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.713
All because of a father's determination

37:38.757 --> 37:43.510
that no fat white man,
like your fathers probably,

37:44.804 --> 37:50.726
would ever send his son to
the clubhouse for cigarettes and beer.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.528
I'm sorry,
what did you say about our fathers?

38:05.200 --> 38:06.575
You better go.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.328
Mr. Doyle Gipson, you is now bankrupt!

38:12.374 --> 38:14.249
And you owe me $5,000.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.772
- Hello?
- It's me.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.692
- So you really bought a house?
- Yeah.

38:39.776 --> 38:41.819
- Wanna play a round of golf?
- Really? You actually own it?

38:41.903 --> 38:47.282
Yeah, it's not a mansion on a hill,
and it needs a lot of work.

38:47.367 --> 38:50.035
- Let me tee off!
- But it'd be yours, it'd be your house.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.746
- God!
- Here we go! Gonna hit the ball!

38:52.831 --> 38:54.331
God!

38:54.416 --> 38:57.376
What? This line's going dead.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.004
Obviously, it would be better for
the boys to be near their father.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.172
- What... What?
- To have you nearby.

39:02.257 --> 39:03.549
He's talking about our fathers.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.342
- What? What?
- You're perfectly clear.

39:05.427 --> 39:08.595
- Listen, I'll call you back.
- Talking to your daddy?

39:11.766 --> 39:15.144
- God! You hit me!
- I'll hit you again! You like it?

39:17.814 --> 39:19.606
Jesus, what the fuck?

39:20.525 --> 39:23.944
- Mister, please! I got kids, man!
- Yeah? Well, so do I!

39:30.368 --> 39:34.538
Doyle Gipson,
this is Gavin Banek calling.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.665
I have something that I want to tell you.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.959
First of all,
I wanted to shake hands, all right?

39:39.044 --> 39:41.754
I wanted to start over.
I gave you a chance.

39:41.838 --> 39:44.214
And you did this. Fine.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.717
I have just turned off your credit.

39:47.343 --> 39:51.638
You are now a spirit
without a body, all right?

39:51.723 --> 39:56.351
Now, I can go on and on pulling
your life down around your ears.

39:56.895 --> 40:00.355
You can turn it off.
You can go back to the way things were.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.609
Just give me my file back! Just... Today.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.321
I mean, just... I mean... Thank you.

40:07.614 --> 40:11.784
Give me my file back, get the credit
turned back on. Okay? Today.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.577
Thank you.

40:24.297 --> 40:26.423
- Has he phoned yet?
- Not yet.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.641
- Look at this.
- What? What is it?

40:35.725 --> 40:38.727
It's the life of Doyle Gipson.
His whole life.

40:39.854 --> 40:44.983
We have his bank, his wife, kids.
Two boys, Danny and Steve.

40:45.693 --> 40:49.863
Their birth dates, the school they go to,
credit card balances,

40:50.573 --> 40:54.451
health records, his cholesterol is high,
but his blood pressure is normal.

40:54.536 --> 40:59.873
I'm 29 years old.
The foundation has $107 million in it.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.918
My bosses are the trustees.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.131
So why didn't they come to court
with me?

41:09.634 --> 41:12.302
Mina Dunne hates me.
I assume there's a reason.

41:12.387 --> 41:15.764
Why am I always the last guy
in the room to know why?

41:17.600 --> 41:20.394
What's in those files
that I haven't seen?

41:36.244 --> 41:38.829
Willard. Can you get me a messenger?

41:39.372 --> 41:40.622
What for?

41:44.169 --> 41:45.294
I found something in the street.

41:45.378 --> 41:47.504
I wanna give it back
to the person it belongs to.

41:47.589 --> 41:51.425
- Is there a reward or something?
- Yeah.

41:52.093 --> 41:56.054
- What is it?
- Doing the right thing, giving it back.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.848
- That's it?
- That's it.

41:57.932 --> 42:01.185
- That's the reward.
- How about that?

42:02.145 --> 42:03.937
Yeah, how about that.

42:10.653 --> 42:15.866
Congratulations. Yes. Okay. Yes.

42:15.950 --> 42:19.328
Mr. Gipson, it's Ron Cabot
at Queens Borough Federal.

42:19.412 --> 42:22.497
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

42:23.833 --> 42:27.586
If you can give me a call today,
or if itâ€™s convenient to stop by the bank,

42:27.670 --> 42:29.880
I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

42:31.007 --> 42:35.302
Doyle Gipson,
this is Gavin Banek calling.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.180
I have something that I want to tell you.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.517
I lied to you this morning.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.396
When I was on my way to the court,
I stopped off at a diner to prepare.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.607
I took the files out, I looked them over.

42:48.691 --> 42:51.151
When I was leaving, I put them back.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.903
At least, I could've sworn
I put them back.

42:52.987 --> 42:56.240
But when I got to the court,
the power of appointment was missing.

42:56.324 --> 42:59.451
And the court has given me until the
end of the day to produce the original.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.787
- Call the diner?
- Yes, I did.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.538
All the trash has been picked up,

43:03.623 --> 43:06.041
but we're tracking it,
and I think we'll probably get it back.

43:06.125 --> 43:09.378
- I just wanted you to know.
- Why did you lie to us?

43:12.340 --> 43:13.966
I'm really sorry.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.010
You're sorry?

43:17.095 --> 43:19.721
Hey, who the fuck gives a shit
about the struggles of your character?

43:19.806 --> 43:21.390
Get out of here, you son of a bitch!

43:21.474 --> 43:23.850
If you have to go through every
fucking garbage bag in this city,

43:23.935 --> 43:25.060
you find that goddamn file,

43:25.144 --> 43:26.645
or you're gonna be
the disaster of my life!

43:26.729 --> 43:28.647
Look, wait a minute.
We might get the file back, okay?

43:28.731 --> 43:30.941
But if we don't, we have
to adopt a strong position.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.067
I need to see the rest of those files.

43:32.151 --> 43:33.360
No, you're not gonna see the files!

43:33.444 --> 43:34.653
What the hell do you
wanna see the files for?

43:34.737 --> 43:36.113
Why not? He's my goddamn client!

43:36.197 --> 43:37.656
Hey, what are you gonna do,
give me a lecture on law?

43:37.740 --> 43:39.157
Listen. Why did you send me
into the court by myself?

43:39.242 --> 43:40.325
I'm your son-in-law, for Christ's sake!

43:40.410 --> 43:42.244
Hey, don't talk to me like that.
I hired you, you little shit!

43:42.328 --> 43:44.413
Stephen. Stephen, calm down!
Stephen, quiet, please!

43:44.539 --> 43:47.457
There's a way out.
There's a way out of this.

43:48.793 --> 43:51.420
A way out?
By letting him bring the files into court?

43:51.504 --> 43:54.631
Calm down and stay with me here.
Okay.

43:54.716 --> 43:57.884
Now, we had a signed document, right?
Didn't we?

43:57.969 --> 43:59.970
- Yes.
- Okay. Now.

44:00.054 --> 44:03.181
The power of appointment
is eight pages.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.562
The living will, which also
has his signature, is 10.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.692
So we can reformat
the power of appointment

44:13.776 --> 44:17.070
and, using the signature page
from the living will,

44:18.239 --> 44:21.658
attach it to the new printout
of the power of appointment.

44:21.743 --> 44:24.578
And code the header
to match the document.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.830
- What do you think? Will it pass?
- Yeah, this could work.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.833
Stephen, I didn't ask you.
I didn't ask you, all right?

44:29.917 --> 44:32.085
Gavin, will it pass?

44:33.338 --> 44:35.213
We forge it?
We just forge the document?

44:35.298 --> 44:38.050
Hey, hey, hey. You screwed this up,
you lost the fucking file.

44:38.134 --> 44:39.885
Nobody's asking you
to get yourself out of it alone.

44:39.969 --> 44:42.512
We're willing to put ourselves
on the line for you with this.

44:42.597 --> 44:47.184
Making a file is fraud. A new file
is fraud. You understand that?

44:48.728 --> 44:51.688
And we're saying that we're gonna put
our own careers on the line for you.

44:51.773 --> 44:53.440
That's what it means to be a partner.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.817
We're not inventing. We're not.
We're not inventing.

44:55.902 --> 44:58.028
We're just reproducing something
that already exists.

44:58.112 --> 45:00.947
Look, Gavin, you take this into the court,

45:01.282 --> 45:05.702
and, buddy, we can go on with our lives
like this never happened.

45:09.665 --> 45:11.083
Let me think about it.

45:11.167 --> 45:14.961
What the hell are you gonna think
about, your high school ethics class?

45:15.046 --> 45:18.590
What choice have you got?
Wanna go to jail?

45:28.351 --> 45:30.644
No, I don't want to go to jail.

46:36.919 --> 46:40.005
Come on! Get out of here!
Leave it! Move it!

46:41.090 --> 46:42.674
Go! Move!

47:50.284 --> 47:53.662
- What does it say?
- They pay themselves $1.5 million.

47:53.746 --> 47:58.542
Each. Out of the trust. Out of
the income of the trust. Jesus Christ!

47:58.626 --> 48:01.670
Which is why they got rid of Mina Dunne
and the rest of the board.

48:01.754 --> 48:05.840
- It's probably not even illegal.
- No, it's probably just disgusting.

48:05.925 --> 48:09.928
- I did this. I did this.
- No, you didn't.

48:11.180 --> 48:13.723
- I did this. I did.
- No, you did not.

48:22.733 --> 48:24.192
What do I do?

48:25.152 --> 48:27.070
You give me the file and I'll take it back.

48:27.154 --> 48:28.613
- Take it back?
- What?

48:28.698 --> 48:31.408
You didn't know
who these people were?

48:31.492 --> 48:33.243
You married into it.

48:39.959 --> 48:43.253
Since breakfast, I've left
the scene of an accident,

48:43.796 --> 48:47.799
I just bankrupted a guy
I don't even know, lied to my bosses,

48:49.677 --> 48:51.886
pulled a false alarm at work,

48:53.514 --> 48:56.558
discovered I'm a party
to defrauding a charity,

48:59.645 --> 49:01.646
and now I'm sitting here,

49:02.189 --> 49:05.692
seriously contemplating forging
a power of appointment.

49:48.319 --> 49:49.569
Hey, mister!

49:50.404 --> 49:51.988
Mister, hold out your hand.

49:52.073 --> 49:53.073
- What?
- What have you got?

49:53.157 --> 49:54.908
Hold out your hand.

49:55.242 --> 49:57.369
How many hands have you got?

49:57.620 --> 49:58.912
Two.

50:01.791 --> 50:03.083
Thanks.

50:05.169 --> 50:07.128
- Oh, God.
- It's the file.

50:07.797 --> 50:09.756
Oh, no. Shit.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.512
- Wait. No, look, it's...
- It's not the power of appointment.

50:15.596 --> 50:19.057
- It's a notice to appear in court.
- Where's the kid?

50:21.435 --> 50:22.894
Look at this.

50:24.605 --> 50:26.398
It's a phone number.

50:29.694 --> 50:31.861
- Who's that you're with?
- Is that your business?

50:31.946 --> 50:34.781
- Is she your secretary?
- No, she's a lawyer.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.616
- Not your wife?
- No.

50:38.577 --> 50:41.663
Guy leaves the scene of an accident.
Guy cheats on his wife.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.081
Can I have my file back, please?

50:43.165 --> 50:45.417
It'll take me half an hour
to get to my bank.

50:45.501 --> 50:49.671
Now, if my credit's not on by the time
I get there, I destroy the file.

50:49.755 --> 50:53.091
- That's the deal.
- Yeah, okay. Understood. Okay.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.722
- Hello?
- Hey.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.932
- That was pretty fast, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was great.

51:01.016 --> 51:02.892
Listen, man, I need it
turned back on right away.

51:02.977 --> 51:04.728
As fast as you turned it off,
I need you to turn it back on.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.439
Amazing, wasn't it? Two hours!
Two hours!

51:07.523 --> 51:09.149
Yes, it was great, it was fine.
It was terrific.

51:09.233 --> 51:10.567
I need you to turn it back on right now!

51:10.651 --> 51:12.402
Thirty minutes, okay? Can you do that?

51:12.486 --> 51:16.990
- That's a... That's a little harder.
- Please, man. Don't tell me that.

51:17.074 --> 51:20.201
Please, do something.
Do something for me here.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.911
You gotta do something, man.

51:21.996 --> 51:23.580
I'll do my best.

51:31.756 --> 51:33.214
- Hey, babe, how's it going?
- I need to see you.

51:33.299 --> 51:35.967
- Well, it's not a great time right now.
- I need to see you right now.

51:36.051 --> 51:38.511
- Is something wrong?
- No, I just need to see you.

51:38.596 --> 51:40.221
Meet me at Refugio's,
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

51:40.306 --> 51:41.723
- All right. I'll be right there. Okay.
- Okay.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.141
- Don't be late.
- Okay, fine.

51:43.225 --> 51:45.560
- Okay, honey, thanks.
- All right.

51:49.190 --> 51:52.776
I gotta... I gotta go.

51:56.238 --> 51:58.531
Okay? I'll see you in a bit.

52:44.537 --> 52:46.579
Ron. You wanna tell me my credit's off

52:46.664 --> 52:49.290
and I can't get approved for the loan.

52:49.625 --> 52:51.251
- Right.
- Check it.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.587
Well, right here...

52:58.717 --> 53:01.636
Well, that was strange. You're right.
Your credit's back on.

53:01.720 --> 53:02.762
So?

53:05.432 --> 53:07.600
This is so weird.

53:09.478 --> 53:13.773
No, there you go. That's what I thought.
I knew I saw that. I knew it.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.776
I can't help you.

53:16.861 --> 53:19.195
What do you mean, you can't help me?
You just saw.

53:19.280 --> 53:23.074
- There's still a problem.
- No, no, no. It's all taken care of.

53:23.158 --> 53:25.869
It's all been solved.
Look in the computer.

53:25.953 --> 53:28.121
And it says you're bankrupt.

53:32.626 --> 53:35.295
This is a mistake.

53:35.379 --> 53:37.255
If it is... If it is a mistake,

53:37.339 --> 53:40.925
then clearing it up
shouldn't take more than three months.

53:47.725 --> 53:51.477
Ron, I've been having a bit
of a tussle today with someone.

53:51.562 --> 53:54.480
It doesn't matter who.
But what does matter

53:55.024 --> 53:56.566
is that he got into my records.

53:56.650 --> 53:59.068
I... I don't know how,
and that doesn't matter, either.

53:59.153 --> 54:01.988
- It's true, but...
- But you've seen what he did.

54:02.072 --> 54:04.991
He's got some kind
of a computer voodoo.

54:05.075 --> 54:09.078
I... I don't know, but he's got it,
doesn't he?

54:10.372 --> 54:12.916
Someone sure caused you
some trouble.

54:17.129 --> 54:21.174
I need this loan, Ron.
I need it for my life.

54:22.176 --> 54:25.637
Now, nothing has changed
between yesterday and today.

54:25.721 --> 54:28.765
I'm still the same guy.
I wasn't bankrupt yesterday,

54:28.849 --> 54:30.975
and I'm not bankrupt today!

54:33.562 --> 54:37.023
I'm sorry, Mr. Gipson,
the computer says you are.

54:49.119 --> 54:50.662
Now it doesn't!

55:08.931 --> 55:10.390
Are you okay?

55:13.852 --> 55:15.061
What's wrong?

55:19.608 --> 55:23.152
Did you know that my father
had a mistress for 20 years?

55:24.279 --> 55:26.072
- No.
- Don't lie.

55:31.745 --> 55:33.955
I didn't know it was 20 years.

55:35.624 --> 55:37.583
My mother knew about it.

55:38.502 --> 55:42.672
- Why didn't she leave him?
- Because she loved him so much.

55:45.009 --> 55:49.303
And she decided it'd be hypocritical
to leave a man for cheating at home,

55:49.388 --> 55:51.014
when the expensive life
she enjoyed so much

55:51.098 --> 55:55.268
was paid for by a man whose job
was based on finding ways to cheat.

55:56.812 --> 55:59.147
Is that your opinion on the law?

55:59.857 --> 56:02.275
What do you think the law is, Gav,

56:02.776 --> 56:05.278
at this level of the game,
at my father's level of the game,

56:05.362 --> 56:07.447
at your level of the game?

56:08.282 --> 56:11.200
It is a big, vicious rumble, Gavin.

56:13.454 --> 56:17.623
The people who founded this law firm,
and the people who sustain it,

56:18.625 --> 56:21.127
understand the way the world works.

56:22.755 --> 56:25.840
If you wanna continue to live
the way we've been living...

56:25.924 --> 56:27.592
You have to steal.

56:30.971 --> 56:33.473
I could have married an honest man.

56:36.060 --> 56:41.022
I could have lived with a professor
of Middle English, for example.

56:42.274 --> 56:45.526
If he was a moral man,
and had tenure at Princeton.

56:46.820 --> 56:50.490
But I didn't.
I married a Wall Street lawyer.

56:51.950 --> 56:54.118
Which means I married someone
who lives in a world

56:54.203 --> 56:57.538
where when a man comes to the edge
of things, he has to commit

56:57.623 --> 57:00.416
to staying there and living there.

57:01.126 --> 57:03.169
Can you live there, Gavin?

57:04.797 --> 57:06.881
Can you live there with me?

57:12.054 --> 57:15.348
You're not gonna do
anything stupid like leaving me.

57:15.724 --> 57:19.519
You've had fantasies, I'm sure.
So have I. But we're married.

57:22.523 --> 57:23.981
I knew about Michelle.

57:24.066 --> 57:28.069
I knew when it was happening.
And I knew when it was finished.

57:31.490 --> 57:33.366
And I know you love me.

57:35.202 --> 57:37.703
You do love me. And I love you, too.

57:39.623 --> 57:42.625
I'm your wife,
and I want to stand beside you.

57:51.385 --> 57:53.553
Just let me help you, Gavin.

57:54.847 --> 57:56.889
Let me help you with this.

58:02.604 --> 58:04.647
What do you want me to do?

58:07.442 --> 58:10.486
Take the signature page from
the living will and attach it

58:10.571 --> 58:14.115
to the newly formatted copy
of the power of appointment.

58:15.909 --> 58:19.871
Bring it to the courthouse,
and then meet me for dinner tonight.

58:20.414 --> 58:22.957
We're going out with Karen and Carl.

58:26.837 --> 58:28.379
Karen and Carl.

58:30.507 --> 58:32.300
I forgot about Karen and Carl.

58:32.384 --> 58:34.010
And I remembered.

58:37.181 --> 58:40.183
We're a team, Gav. We're partners.

59:12.633 --> 59:13.758
Arugula salad?

59:13.842 --> 59:15.551
- Hello?
- A deal's a deal.

59:15.636 --> 59:16.761
The credit's back on?

59:16.845 --> 59:19.222
- Yeah. I used my MasterCard just now.
- Sir, we don't allow cell phones.

59:19.306 --> 59:20.514
Wow, that was fast!

59:20.599 --> 59:21.724
- Sir?
- Okay, one second.

59:21.808 --> 59:23.809
They turned my credit back on.
Now I owe you something.

59:23.894 --> 59:26.687
Thank God you did not
throw that away this morning.

59:26.772 --> 59:29.440
- So how you wanna do this?
- One second.

59:29.566 --> 59:32.026
- You wanna come to my office?
- No. No.

59:32.110 --> 59:34.237
- Why not?
- You got your car?

59:34.321 --> 59:35.571
I can get it, it's at the office, yeah.

59:35.656 --> 59:38.741
How about the courthouse? You do
have to turn this thing in, don't you?

59:38.825 --> 59:39.992
Right.

59:40.410 --> 59:44.163
- See, I'm thinking about you.
- Okay. Listen, Doyle...

59:44.414 --> 59:47.917
Look, look, look, please. You aren't
gonna get all soft on me, are you?

59:48.001 --> 59:49.835
I just want you to know
that I'm sorry, you know.

59:49.920 --> 59:53.881
And I just...
I'm just glad this thing is over.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.377
Don't get too close.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:42.638
- Hello?
- Hey, my hero. My champion.

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:45.349
It's all over. He called me.
He's giving me back the file.

01:00:45.434 --> 01:00:47.977
- Really?
- What do you mean?

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:51.480
Because there's...
There's one thing I couldn't do.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.399
What couldn't you do?

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:56.986
Hey...

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.406
This damn bankruptcy
has a life of its own.

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:04.660
What couldn't you do?

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:08.372
I couldn't undo the bankruptcy. Sorry.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.003
Shit.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:01.777
Are you drunk?

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.448
No.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:06.991
Are you sure?

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:10.870
Yes, I'm sure.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.346
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:34.560
It's nice.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.407
Show me the house.

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:02.588
This is the wood of the cross

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:07.927
On which was hung
the Savior of the world

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:14.433
- Come, let us worship
- Come, let us worship

01:04:16.978 --> 01:04:21.190
This is the wood of the cross

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:26.278
On which was hung
the Savior of the world

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:33.244
- Come, let us worship
- Come, let us worship

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:39.500
This is the wood of the cross

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:44.880
On which was hung
the Savior of the world

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:54.348
Do you know
why I took the job in Oregon?

01:04:57.978 --> 01:04:59.270
To

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.818
get as far away from me as possible.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:12.491
I looked at a lot of cities,

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:17.329
and Portland has thousands

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.457
of nice, dull, bearded guys,

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:25.004
and I thought,
you know, guys like this, just...

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:28.173
Guys.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.634
I could find one.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:33.804
A better version of you, Doyle.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:37.433
A version of you,
but a better version of you.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.018
What I always

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:44.106
wanted you to be,
and what you were for a little,

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.026
when I met you.

01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:56.660
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

01:05:56.745 --> 01:06:00.623
I don't... It's all right.
I don't want confession. I just...

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:02.958
All the seats were full out there,
so I came in here,

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:05.210
just to listen to the song.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:07.463
There's some seats up front.
I'll show you.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:10.299
I don't... I don't want that. Thank you.

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:16.472
Are you Catholic?

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.396
It's beautiful.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:28.651
No, it's not. But it could have been.

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.072
I don't know what's gonna happen,

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:37.117
but I don't blame you
for wanting to leave.

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.580
Oregon,

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:44.708
the boys,

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.587
it'll be good for them.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.676
I know how hard it must be
for you to say that.

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:01.600
I'm sorry I was late today.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:05.604
We should have waited.

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:09.358
I came here for some meaning.
I'm trying...

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.277
I want you to give the world
meaning to me.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:14.905
Why does the world need meaning?

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.491
Why does the... What?

01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:20.494
Because the world's a sewer!

01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:23.872
Because the world's a shithole
and a garbage dump.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:27.751
Because my father-in-law
got me to screw a good man,

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:30.713
a decent man, out of his money,

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.798
and my wife cheers me on.

01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:36.176
Because I got into a fender-bender
with this guy on the FDR.

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:39.263
And I had a fight with him. I tried
to do everything I could to settle it.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:42.099
- But this guy just won't let it go.
- Why?

01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:47.396
- Why wouldn't he let it go?
- I don't know why! I don't know why.

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:52.025
Sometimes God likes to put two guys
in a paper bag and just let them rip.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.411
Thank you.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:07.624
Thank you for letting us go.

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.773
Are you saying
he's a threat to his children?

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:34.359
Yes, he's told friends
that if his ex-wife got custody,

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.112
he would kidnap his sons
and take them out of this country.

01:08:37.197 --> 01:08:39.113
- And she got custody?
- We were in court this morning.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.283
Now, I don't know for a fact
that he's coming here, but...

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:45.120
- Doyle Gipson. Really?
- Really. What does that mean?

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:47.790
He comes to every school play
that they're in. All the teachers...

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:50.959
So a guy comes to a school play,
you trust him?

01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:56.423
Doyle Gipson is a man
of no honor at all!

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:58.759
A low man.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:02.720
But that's okay, because
nobody else has any honor, either.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.973
That's what makes life
so hard for people,

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.642
is that we're taught this fairy tale.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:10.103
The good end well,
and the bad end poorly.

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:12.814
- Do you believe that?
- I'd like to.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:16.568
He's coming here. Be ready for him.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.580
Is he in?

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:32.042
Hello? Is he... Is he there?

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.337
Well, I just need to leave
a message for him.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:39.883
I'm... I'm calling
from his children's school.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.179
Yeah.
I'm afraid there's been an accident.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.093
How are my sons?

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.596
- Who are your sons?
- Danny and Stephen Gipson.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.264
I received a call
that said they were hurt.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.892
- Danny and Stephen Gipson?
- I haven't heard anything.

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.894
I wanna see my sons!

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.021
- Mr. Gipson...
- Mrs. Miller, how are the boys?

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:38.025
Mr. Gipson, I think you should leave.
Before we call the police.

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:43.071
Mr. Gipson, don't make me
call the police.

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:48.410
- So they're fine?
- Yes, your boys are fine.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.204
- And all of this is just a mistake?
- Yes.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.252
I'm sorry.

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:12.601
Danny! Stevie!

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:13.977
Call the police.

01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:17.064
Daniel Gipson! Stevie Gipson!
Can you hear me?

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.692
- Can you hear me?
- Call their mother.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.111
- Gipson boys, where are you?
- Daddy!

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.446
Danny, come back here.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.031
- Come back here and have a seat.
- My daddy!

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.326
- Stevie! Danny!
- Daddy!

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.329
- Stevie!
- Daddy!

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:34.623
- Get off me!
- Don't hurt my dad!

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:35.916
Danny! Stevie!

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.919
- Get down!
- Daddy! No!

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.796
- Daddy! No!
- Calm down!

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.798
Danny! Stephen!

01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:47.719
Daddy! Dad!

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.389
They said you were hurt!

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:53.392
- You haven't been hurt or sick today?
- No!

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.310
- Come back here.
- No! Daddy!

01:11:55.395 --> 01:11:57.312
We're gonna pick you up
nice and slowly. All right? Got it?

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:58.397
Okay. Okay.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:02.192
- Don't hurt my dad! Please! Stop!
- All right, let's go. Up.

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:06.071
- Daddy!
- Nice and easy. That's it.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.366
Come on.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.579
Okay, let's go.

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:18.208
See that?
I tried to make peace with you.

01:12:25.383 --> 01:12:28.677
You know what I can do to you
for trying to kill me?

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.222
You know who I am?
You know who I am?

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:35.434
You see what I can do to you?
You try to kill me?

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:38.103
Motherfucker. What's up now?

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:53.201
Shit.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:22.355
Empty your pockets, sir.

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:27.611
Keys.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:30.906
Change.

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:32.491
Wallet.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.409
Pager.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:39.790
File.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:49.216
Hey, how you doing?
I'm looking for a Ron Cabot.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.760
- Count your money, sir.
- What?

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.512
Count your money.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.683
Mr. Cabot, I'm Doyle Gipson's attorney.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.853
I don't really wanna talk about him.
Since we're closing now, I don't have to.

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:04.856
Okay. I understand that.
Mr. Cabot, I just need you to help me...

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:09.736
$77.

01:14:09.821 --> 01:14:12.531
I'm asking you to try
to help me help Doyle here.

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:13.990
- He needs it.
- You gotta understand.

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:15.617
He has had about
the worst day of his life.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.912
He had a credit problem that
was not his fault. It was caused by...

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:21.665
Someone who hacked their way
into his records, I know.

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:23.875
How can... How can we get
this whole thing straightened out?

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.919
- What can I do?
- Nothing.

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:37.222
Okay, Mr. Cabot...

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:42.936
Ron, let's try this another way, okay?

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:46.815
Let's say there's a different man.
You don't know this guy.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:49.985
And he has some credit problems
that aren't his fault.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.154
And then another man,
you don't know him,

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.322
he wants to help the first guy, okay?

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:58.952
Now what does he have to do to help
the second guy take out a loan? Ron.

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:02.205
Come on. What do I do? Just cosign?
What's the thing? What's the deal?

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:03.748
Can you please tell me what I gotta do?

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:07.419
I'm asking you what I have to do
to make this thing work.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:11.882
You know this has nothing
to do with you. It's this guy.

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:14.259
- He's been at me all day.
- Somebody you've been fighting with?

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:15.427
Yes.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.012
You had a fight with somebody
who hit your car,

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.472
and then you spent the day
in some kind of battle with him.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:22.184
And then he went to the school
to hurt you as hard as he could.

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:23.685
- You believe me?
- Yes.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:27.439
Thank God. Thank God.
This guy, this lawyer, Gavin Banek...

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:30.317
Doyle, stop! Stop, Doyle! I don't care!

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:33.320
See, whatever this little drama you've
gotten yourself into is, guess what?

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:35.864
It's just the kind of thing
that always happens to you,

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:39.242
and it never happens to me
unless I'm in your field of gravity.

01:15:39.327 --> 01:15:41.286
You went crazy
like you always go crazy,

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.704
like you always will go crazy.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:46.041
Drunk or sober, it doesn't matter, Doyle,
'cause that's you!

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:48.001
A person can be loving,

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:50.921
and a person can be crazy all at once.
Fine, great, that's life.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:54.132
But this is not just my life now, or yours.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:59.137
It is the life of two children,
and I have to protect those two children.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:02.265
Is that a misunderstanding? Is it?
Is it, Doyle?

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:05.310
I mean, is that... Is that this guy's fault?

01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:10.398
- At least let me say goodbye to them.
- No!

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:13.526
I'm taking those boys away,
and you will never see them again.

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:16.655
You will never find us.
Do not try to come after us.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.823
Do you hear me? It is over!

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:36.883
On Wall Street, the Dow's down at the
close, down by four and a third points,

01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:39.469
the NASDAQ higher
by around three and a half points.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:40.971
Hurry to your nearest authorized dealer,

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:43.765
save up to $100 during Frederick's
pre-season rebate sale,

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:47.811
which nears time 5:10.
Traffic and AccuWeather in 60 seconds.

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:51.731
Do you have what it takes to pass
the peace-of-mind checklist?

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.747
- Where's Ellen?
- She went home.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:13.253
- Why are you still here?
- You told me to wait.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:20.844
Well, come on in.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:28.893
Have a seat.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:40.363
- So why do you wanna be a lawyer?
- I believe in the law.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:43.575
I believe in order and justice.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:46.703
I believe that people are,
by nature, good.

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:51.291
I believe that historical forces
push us into conflict.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:54.336
And without the law
as a buffer between people,

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.923
we would have a world of vendetta,
a world of violence, a world of chaos...

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.888
The law... The law keeps us civilized.

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:07.390
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think it's...

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.852
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think it's funny.

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:14.939
That's why... That's why
I'm going to give you this job.

01:18:17.777 --> 01:18:21.780
I'm giving you the job, because I want to
hear what you have to say about the law

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:25.116
after you've worked here
for five years, or three years,

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:29.287
or a month, a week, a day, an hour.

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.125
I'm hired?

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:38.171
Don't I have to see a committee
or something?

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.551
- You made bail.
- Who?

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:45.887
A friend.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:52.268
"To the Honorable
Judge Frances Abarbanel.

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:54.437
"I have been unable to recover
the power of appointment

01:18:54.522 --> 01:18:56.439
"signed by Simon Dunne.

01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:58.900
"But even if I had been able to
produce the power of appointment,

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:02.570
"I want the court to know
that the document was a fraud. "

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:04.697
"I induced Mr. Dunne
to sign a document

01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:07.575
"when his mental status was
diminished and he was incapable

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.078
"of making an informed decision. "

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:17.085
They set you up! They made
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:19.295
- And they're gonna make more.
- Yeah, and I made partner

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.589
and a bonus that could've
paid for 200 pianos.

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:23.091
You don't say anything about them.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:26.719
You're taking everything
on your shoulder in this letter.

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:29.514
Why? I mean,
you could send them to jail.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.851
They gotta write their own letters.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:59.544
Let me go.

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:20.398
Hey.

01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:23.776
Should've left me inside.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.362
You're too important to me.

01:20:26.906 --> 01:20:31.242
- Come on, let's go to a meeting.
- No, no, no, I went to one yesterday.

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:35.997
- Well, that was yesterday.
- Yeah, one day at a time, right?

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.750
Yeah, one day at a time,
and do the next right thing.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:41.127
Let's go. There's a meeting at 6:00.

01:20:41.212 --> 01:20:46.257
God grant me the strength to accept
the things I cannot change.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:21:00.438
It's an admirable gesture,
but it's unnecessary.

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:01.814
I can't leave this.
I can't...

01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:04.526
It's unnecessary,
because you've already filed

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.362
the power of appointment with the court.

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:13.868
A bonded courier delivered it
to the judge just before 5:00,

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:16.204
and our bailiff signed for it.

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:21.292
Your note of apology was contrite,
but it was absolutely professional.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.461
Everything's taken care of.

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:27.924
- You filed a forgery.
- Bullshit.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:30.051
I filed what I had to file.
What happened to...

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:32.595
You just disappeared. Time was up.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.390
Come on, you scared the hell out of us.

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:37.475
I didn't know what to do.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.024
So you finally hit rock bottom?

01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:51.239
Today you almost killed a guy.
Tomorrow you might go all the way!

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:53.866
Keep doing the next wrong thing,
you could start a religion,

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:55.076
convince the sober to drink.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.620
Don't tell them to keep
each other alive with hope.

01:21:57.705 --> 01:22:02.000
What you saw today that everything
decent is held together by a covenant.

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:04.502
An agreement not to go bat shit!

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:08.006
You broke the contract!

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:11.301
- I didn't have a drink.
- Well, wow! Thank you for sharing.

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:13.511
You didn't have a drink today.
What an inspiration!

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.680
That's the point, isn't it?

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:18.349
God!

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:29.027
You know, booze isn't really
your drug of choice, anyway.

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:34.574
You're addicted to chaos.

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:39.954
For some of us, it's coke.
For some of us, it's bourbon.

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:42.540
But you, you got hooked on disaster.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:52.717
Fuck.

01:22:57.222 --> 01:23:00.725
Here's what you should do.
You get up Monday morning,

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.978
and you get yourself
on a plane to Texas.

01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:06.105
Take that letter with you.

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:08.399
When you get to Texas,

01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:12.403
you get on the defense team
of somebody on death row.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:18.117
And then put all your energy
into saving a man from execution.

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.747
And then come on back here
in a few months.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:26.584
If you still want to confess, go ahead.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.505
Come on.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:35.385
How the hell do you think
Simon Dunne got his money, huh?

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:42.016
You think those factories in Malaysia
have daycare centers in them?

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.978
Want to check the pollution levels
of his chemical plants in Mexico

01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:50.108
or look at the tax benefits
he got from this foundation?

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:56.197
This is all a tightrope.

01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:00.159
You gotta learn to balance.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:03.037
How can you live like that?

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:07.208
I... I can live with myself,
because, at the end of the day,

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:11.629
I think I do more good than harm.

01:24:15.426 --> 01:24:18.261
What other standard
have I got to judge by?

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:12.440
I have to thank you.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:20.823
For the house?

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.284
I understand what you were trying to do,

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:28.372
but my wife's moving,
she's taking the boys.

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:32.543
The house is a little bit
too much for me right now.

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:36.214
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:40.051
I was a horribly unstable father.

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:45.932
And Valerie says
I'll never see them again.

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:49.936
But you know what?

01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:52.814
I will.

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:55.817
I will.

01:25:58.779 --> 01:26:03.449
I'll see them in a year or two,
maybe three.

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:09.247
I'll go to Portland, I'll call her,

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.669
and I'll find a way
to be their father again.

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:21.259
How about you?

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.599
Well, I have the file,

01:26:30.394 --> 01:26:32.520
but I don't need it anymore.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:42.071
It's been taken care of,
you know, never happened.

01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:50.121
But it did happen. Right?

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:53.749
Right.

01:26:58.463 --> 01:26:59.881
So now what?

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:22.987
I'm going to dinner with my wife,

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.032
her parents,

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:33.331
and, this weekend,
I'm gonna go look at a boat.

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:46.177
And then on Monday, I'm gonna
come back in here and go to work.

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:49.055
And then,

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:53.100
magically, this whole

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:59.649
incredible day just somehow
becomes a memory.

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:07.281
It's like you go to the beach.
You go down to the water.

01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:10.868
It's a little cold.
You're not sure if you wanna go in.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:13.955
There's a pretty girl
standing next to you.

01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:16.958
She doesn't want to go in, either.
She sees you.

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:18.542
And you know

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:22.505
if you just asked her her name,

01:28:25.384 --> 01:28:27.385
you would leave with her.

01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:31.222
Forget your life, whoever you came with.

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:36.435
Leave the beach with her.

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:41.357
And after that day,

01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.652
you remember her.

01:28:45.696 --> 01:28:48.698
Not every day,

01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:50.282
or every week.

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:53.953
She comes back to you.

01:28:56.289 --> 01:29:00.459
It's the memory of another life

01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:02.920
you could have had.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.925
Today is that girl.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.578
I'm sorry about what I did.

01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:42.168
Me, too.

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:46.714
Thank you. You brought the file back.

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:06.650
And when you're done,
there's a lovely little place on the hill

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.736
where you can get a...

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:12.740
- Cappuccino.
- Yes, that's right, dear.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:17.078
They're lovely cappuccinos,
and it's clean and it's cool.

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:20.539
And they have these prints on the wall,
they're really quite lovely.

01:30:20.624 --> 01:30:24.877
I don't know who they're by.
They're by that artist...

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:28.130
- Chagall.
- Right. They're Chagalls.

01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:29.799
There are three of them.
They're early Chagalls.

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:33.177
I think he painted them
when he was visiting there.

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:41.310
Am I missing something this evening?

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:43.687
- What is this?
- This, my dear...

01:30:44.147 --> 01:30:48.692
This is Simon Dunne's
power of appointment.

01:30:51.071 --> 01:30:52.488
- I got it back.
- No, you didn't.

01:30:52.572 --> 01:30:54.573
Yes, I did. This is it.

01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:56.450
- It's right here.
- Please, Gavin.

01:30:56.535 --> 01:31:00.287
This is behind us, isn't it?
Haven't we put this behind us?

01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:01.455
- What you said...
- Come on.

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.457
I was thinking about
what you said to me.

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:07.169
About the end of the day,
about doing more good than harm.

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:09.213
That is what you said, isn't it?

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:12.842
- Don't you fuck with me.
- I'm not fucking with you, sir.

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:14.969
Can you imagine
how unpleasant it would be

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:16.804
if the judge got a hold of this file?

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:20.724
That's not going to happen.
That's not going to happen, Gavin.

01:31:22.853 --> 01:31:25.771
I think I might order the snapper.

01:31:29.067 --> 01:31:32.027
I'm gonna hold onto this file.
I'm gonna keep it in a very safe place.

01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:34.238
But I'm not going to Texas.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:36.949
I'm gonna come back
into work on Monday.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:41.245
And I'm gonna start doing that pro bono
work that you recommended that I do.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.873
But I'm gonna do it from our office.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:47.585
The first thing we're gonna do
is help a man buy a house.

01:31:47.878 --> 01:31:49.837
Gavin, can we please not do this?

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:53.299
And I think I would like to be the one
to call Mina Dunne.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:55.050
I'm gonna tell her that you and Walter

01:31:55.135 --> 01:31:57.344
are gonna give back the $3 million

01:31:57.429 --> 01:32:00.347
you stole from
her grandfather's foundation.

01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:11.817
You were right. I can do this.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:14.987
I found the edge.

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:18.657
Can you live there, with me?

01:32:20.952 --> 01:32:22.161
Can you?

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.880
I haven't had a fucking thing
to eat all day, and I'm starving.

01:32:36.426 --> 01:32:38.427
So what are we gonna eat?

01:32:57.447 --> 01:32:59.156
- Mrs. Gipson?
- Yes?

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:01.492
My name is Gavin Banek.

01:33:03.286 --> 01:33:04.912
What do you want?

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:07.831
Five minutes, ma'am.

01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:10.417
I owe your husband 20.

01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:13.961
Hell, I'm only asking for five with you.
