00:43.134 --> 00:47.180
Ooh! ln all my years,
never have I seen the streets...

00:47.347 --> 00:50.767
so full of bustle and hustle
and assorted commotion.

00:50.933 --> 00:52.769
Our princess is to wed.

00:52.935 --> 00:57.607
Ohh, wonderful!
And who's the lucky prince?

00:57.774 --> 01:02.153
Not a prince at all.
Just a no-account street rat!

01:02.320 --> 01:06.032
No way! Try it phonetically.

01:06.199 --> 01:09.327
It's Aladdin!

01:12.955 --> 01:16.793
Aw! Some of you don't believe.

01:24.008 --> 01:25.885
In colour!

01:29.973 --> 01:34.143
There's a party here in Agrabah
There's excitement in the air

01:34.310 --> 01:36.479
People pouring in
from near and far

01:36.646 --> 01:38.982
'Cause Jasmine and Aladdin
are gonna have a weddin'

01:39.148 --> 01:43.486
There's a party here in Agrabah
Everybody will be there

01:43.653 --> 01:48.032
So if you're a pauper or a shah
Do somethin' with your hair

01:48.199 --> 01:50.535
You mustn't wear
an outfit that's naughty

01:50.702 --> 01:52.745
A turban that's unravelling
just won't do

01:52.912 --> 01:55.164
No earrings that are
tasteless or gaudy

01:55.331 --> 01:57.583
You're gonna look gorgeous
when I get through

01:57.750 --> 02:02.005
There's a party here in Agrabah
So I'm going to paint the town

02:02.171 --> 02:06.843
If you want to see what colours are
Follow me around

02:07.010 --> 02:11.639
Aladdin's gettin' married and it's
gonna be the wedding of the century

02:11.806 --> 02:16.019
My buddy's gettin' married and
you're gonna see just how much I can do

02:16.185 --> 02:18.354
- You've heard of
your safari bar mitzvahs

02:18.521 --> 02:20.690
- You've all been to a luau sweet 16
- Ahh!

02:20.857 --> 02:22.984
Well, none of them compare
to what this is

02:23.151 --> 02:25.194
The food'll be disgusting
By evening you'll be busting

02:25.361 --> 02:29.699
There's a party here in Agrabah
and it's got us all aglow

02:29.866 --> 02:33.369
If a street rat could've come so far
Maybe I could do it

02:33.536 --> 02:36.706
- Sure, there's nothing to it
- There's a party here in Agrabah

02:36.873 --> 02:38.583
But we're not sure
that we'll go

02:38.750 --> 02:43.421
For although the bride is la-di-dah
The groom is awfully low

02:43.588 --> 02:48.384
And now we take you down
to the palace, where everyone

02:48.551 --> 02:51.721
Without Jafar and all of his malice
Everybody's happy

02:51.888 --> 02:53.890
What could possibly go wrong?

02:54.057 --> 02:58.269
There's a party here in Agrabah
and we're gonna rob 'em blind

02:58.436 --> 03:02.148
While they're all munching caviar
create a small disturbance

03:02.315 --> 03:04.400
I will sneak up from behind

03:04.567 --> 03:08.863
There's a party here in Agrabah
and the loot is pouring in

03:09.030 --> 03:11.449
I like this wedding stuff so far

03:11.616 --> 03:14.911
Maybe if I'm pleasant
I'll get to keep a present

03:15.078 --> 03:17.038
We've ordered just
a few tasteful flowers

03:17.205 --> 03:19.457
And valets who'll
carefully park for you

03:19.624 --> 03:21.751
The bridesmaids have
been dressing for hours

03:21.918 --> 03:23.628
Girls, you look just lovely
And so grown-up too

03:23.795 --> 03:28.508
There's a party here in Agrabah
Guests are filling up the room

03:28.675 --> 03:31.594
But there's something missing
Yes, aha

03:31.761 --> 03:34.222
Where is the groom

03:52.281 --> 03:53.783
Hello.

03:53.950 --> 03:57.453
Somebody's gonna be late
for his own wedding!

03:57.620 --> 03:59.998
Hold on, Genie.
There's something I need.

04:00.164 --> 04:02.333
I gotcha.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.462
It's a bachelor party, big boy!

04:06.629 --> 04:09.966
- None for you.
You're the designated flyer.

04:10.133 --> 04:13.136
This is for the wedding.

04:16.471 --> 04:19.058
Well, that's, uh--
that's a nice dagger.

04:19.225 --> 04:23.688
Interesting nuptial accessory.
It's a, uh, a bit sharp.

04:23.855 --> 04:26.941
- It belonged to my father.
- Your father?

04:27.108 --> 04:29.360
You never said a word
about your father.

04:29.527 --> 04:33.281
Oh, I've got to let the caterer know!
Chicken or sea bass?

04:33.406 --> 04:37.702
He's not coming to the wedding.
He died a long time ago.

04:37.869 --> 04:40.538
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

04:41.622 --> 04:43.791
I never knew him.

04:43.958 --> 04:46.127
Maybe if I did,
I'd feel ready for this.

04:46.252 --> 04:49.672
Al, are you getting cold feet?

04:49.839 --> 04:52.842
No, Genie. It's just that...

04:53.009 --> 04:57.513
I-l've always been a street rat,
stealin' what I need to survive,

04:57.680 --> 05:00.016
- runnin' from the guards,
- Uh-huh.

05:00.183 --> 05:02.769
- Iivin' my life alone.
- Ohh.

05:02.935 --> 05:06.272
I'm takin' a big step today
into a new world.

05:06.439 --> 05:09.275
Today's topic: fears
of the future family man.

05:09.442 --> 05:12.362
AI from Agrabah, share with us.

05:12.528 --> 05:15.198
I never had a father to show me
how to raise a family.

05:15.323 --> 05:17.533
No role model.
Get a little deeper.

05:17.659 --> 05:19.827
What do I know about families?

05:19.994 --> 05:21.871
Genie, what if
I'm no good at it?

05:22.038 --> 05:24.540
Ah, if my father were here--

05:24.707 --> 05:28.544
Al, little buddy, if your father were
here, he'd be as proud of you as I am.

05:31.214 --> 05:34.092
I just wish he could see this.

05:34.217 --> 05:36.928
There's a party here in Agrabah

05:37.095 --> 05:39.973
And the party's all for me

05:40.139 --> 05:43.059
Just look, you guys
at where we are

05:43.226 --> 05:46.062
And how our dreams
have come to be

05:46.229 --> 05:51.275
There's a party here in Agrabah
and I can't believe it's true

05:51.442 --> 05:53.945
After all this waiting
here we are

05:54.112 --> 05:57.281
We'll finally get to say
"I do"

05:57.448 --> 06:00.034
I never, ever had a real family

06:00.201 --> 06:03.246
I never, ever had
a real, true friend

06:03.413 --> 06:06.165
Someone who could just
understand me

06:06.332 --> 06:08.793
Hey, come on, Aladdin!
This mush has gotta end!

06:08.960 --> 06:13.673
There's a party here in Agrabah
and it's starting right away

06:13.840 --> 06:16.134
Let's get ya dressed
'cause you're the star

06:16.301 --> 06:18.594
Hey, come on
It's your wedding day

06:28.563 --> 06:31.232
Aladdin's gettin' married
and it's gonna be

06:31.399 --> 06:33.901
The wedding of the century

06:34.068 --> 06:36.487
Amazing how Aladdin
could've come so far

06:36.654 --> 06:38.906
- They're finally getting married!
- They're finally getting married!

06:39.073 --> 06:41.326
- They're finally getting married!
- Look at all these presents!

06:41.492 --> 06:43.786
We're finally getting married.

06:43.953 --> 06:46.164
- I'm finally gettin' married!
- They're finally gettin' married!

06:46.331 --> 06:55.506
At the party in Agrabah

06:55.673 --> 06:58.801
There's a party in Agrabah

06:58.968 --> 07:02.180
A party goin' on now! Gotta
party! Gotta party! Help me!

07:02.347 --> 07:04.849
I can't stop myself!
Somebody rub the lamp!

07:05.016 --> 07:07.935
Somebody rub the lamp!
Ah, you know I feel it!

07:08.102 --> 07:09.937
That's enough.

07:30.625 --> 07:34.295
Why do you walk in the open
while I suffocate like an animal?

07:34.462 --> 07:36.798
Someone has to keep
a cool head, Sa'luk.

07:36.965 --> 07:41.260
Someone will have no head
if this is another wild goose chase.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.639
The oracle is the real thing.

07:44.806 --> 07:46.683
This time I'm sure.

07:51.813 --> 07:55.441
Hello, and welcome to Lifestyles
of the Rich and Magical.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.695
That's right. We're taking you
to the marriage of the millennium.

07:58.861 --> 08:01.030
And who's this coming
on the lovely stretch camel?

08:01.197 --> 08:04.993
Oh, it's Cleopatra and Caesar,
and they're bringing a salad.

08:05.159 --> 08:06.911
How wonderful!

08:07.078 --> 08:09.664
Oh, look, there's Osiris.
Oh, Osiris!

08:09.831 --> 08:12.208
Osiris, can we have
a word with you?

08:12.375 --> 08:16.671
Oh, no, the crowd is parting.
Who's coming? It's Moses!

08:16.838 --> 08:20.508
- And your name is?
- I'm Thor.

08:20.675 --> 08:23.386
Once again, this whole broadcast
has been brought to you by sand!

08:23.553 --> 08:26.681
It's everywhere. Get used to it.

08:26.848 --> 08:28.725
Come on. Come on.

08:28.891 --> 08:31.269
I can see fine from back here.

08:31.436 --> 08:33.270
Uh-uh. It's Aladdin.

08:33.438 --> 08:36.274
Look, there's one thing
I get sentimental about...

08:36.441 --> 08:38.943
and I'm sittin' on it.

08:40.486 --> 08:44.365
- Huh?
- The loot, monkey. The loot.

08:44.532 --> 08:48.077
Bad news, Al. The boutonnieres
clash with the cummerbunds.

08:48.244 --> 08:51.247
Genie, isn't it
a little late for that?

08:51.414 --> 08:55.251
What? What are you trying
to say? Out with it! What? What?

08:55.418 --> 08:57.378
They're here.

08:57.545 --> 08:59.922
Oh, no!

09:00.048 --> 09:03.468
I'm late, I'm late
for a very important date.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.993
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

09:29.118 --> 09:30.995
Your Majesty.

09:52.517 --> 09:56.354
D-Don't look so solemn, boy.
This is a happy day.

09:56.479 --> 09:59.357
Oh, look. It's a Kodiak moment.

10:00.984 --> 10:03.027
Put that bear outta here.

10:09.534 --> 10:12.286
Ohh! Hmm.

10:27.635 --> 10:30.805
- Wow!
- Oh, yeah!

10:40.523 --> 10:42.734
I never thought
this day would come.

10:42.900 --> 10:46.029
Now I'm afraid that it
has come all too soon.

10:46.195 --> 10:48.406
Oh, Father.

10:50.074 --> 10:54.120
- You distract the guards.
- Part of your plan?

10:54.287 --> 10:57.040
A large part.

10:57.206 --> 10:58.875
It's time.

11:23.566 --> 11:26.069
It's all so magical.

11:26.235 --> 11:28.237
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not.

11:33.951 --> 11:36.120
Oh, sorry.

11:37.956 --> 11:41.959
- Well, we're here.
- Together forever.

11:50.426 --> 11:52.595
Let me be the point man.

11:54.931 --> 11:57.141
I thought the earth wasn't supposed
to move until the honeymoon.

11:57.308 --> 11:59.102
Whoa! Oh, my word!

12:01.270 --> 12:02.981
Stampede!

12:06.984 --> 12:09.654
What is going on here?

12:15.326 --> 12:18.621
Come here, monkey boy!
You were almost Dumbo toe jam.

12:21.791 --> 12:24.794
Oh, they trampled the carpet!
That's a little redundant.

12:24.961 --> 12:28.089
So this isn't a bad day
for you, really, is it?

12:37.015 --> 12:39.142
It is an attack.

12:41.686 --> 12:43.271
Not in this palace!

12:56.159 --> 12:59.829
I think we're gonna have
a little problem with leaks.

13:18.056 --> 13:20.433
It must be here somewhere.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.852
Meet your match, Zorro!

13:23.019 --> 13:26.022
Good birdie.
Polly want a little--

13:26.189 --> 13:29.525
Say "cracker" and I'll
let you have it on principle!

13:31.069 --> 13:34.197
- You have a lot of spirit.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:34.364 --> 13:36.366
And a lot of mouth.

14:02.725 --> 14:05.603
- They fight like demons.
- Worse than demons.

14:05.770 --> 14:08.898
- These are the Forty Thieves.
- Really? I get 39.

14:12.443 --> 14:14.320
Forty.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.447
Where is it?

14:16.614 --> 14:19.575
Ah, at last.

14:23.913 --> 14:27.208
- Can I see your invitation?
- Stay out of my way, boy,

14:27.375 --> 14:30.086
and you won't get hurt!

14:32.130 --> 14:37.010
Fool! You don't stand a chance
against the King of Thieves!

14:37.176 --> 14:39.595
When I get up, I'll bow to you!

14:40.388 --> 14:43.266
Mmm. Huh? Ohh!

14:43.433 --> 14:46.102
That was for ruining my wedding.

14:46.227 --> 14:49.731
Huh? Aah!

15:08.666 --> 15:11.336
I guess there's really
no point to this now.

15:33.858 --> 15:37.987
Freeze, sandbags!
Don't make me use the other end!

15:50.541 --> 15:53.503
Mama always said,
"Magic is as magic does."

15:53.670 --> 15:56.464
Cassim said nothing about
facing the powers of a genie.

15:56.631 --> 16:01.135
Get the others out of here.
We'll leave the "king" to his plans.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.867
Where's the King of Thieves?

16:27.412 --> 16:30.248
I'll see you again, boy.

16:34.544 --> 16:37.755
Ooh! This is not my fault.

16:37.922 --> 16:40.883
This was not built to code.

16:42.343 --> 16:46.889
Good luck gettin' back
the catering deposit.

16:47.056 --> 16:49.934
- Oh, my!
- Fear not, O father of the bride.

16:50.101 --> 16:53.396
- We can rebuild!
- Oh, please do.

16:53.563 --> 16:56.357
We can't have a wedding
without a pavilion.

16:56.524 --> 17:00.611
All right, a wedding pavilion
it is, my man.

17:03.781 --> 17:06.451
Hey, I wanna see some resumés
on these guys.

17:06.576 --> 17:09.829
And don't let the one with
the beak near any power tool.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.248
Uh, yes, yes, Genie,
whatever it takes.

17:12.415 --> 17:15.585
I am sorry about
all this, Jasmine.

17:15.752 --> 17:17.587
Daughter?

17:17.878 --> 17:20.256
What were they after, the gifts?

17:20.423 --> 17:24.344
Not all the gifts. This is what
the King of Thieves wanted.

17:24.510 --> 17:29.057
With all the other great stuff,
why go for this thing?

17:29.223 --> 17:32.393
Your question is mine to answer.

17:34.854 --> 17:39.150
The King of Thieves sought my sight
to find the ultimate treasure.

17:39.317 --> 17:42.236
- Did someone say "treasure"?
- Genie?

17:42.403 --> 17:45.281
Oh, it looks like an oracle.

17:45.448 --> 17:50.453
I see all that has been
and all that will be.

17:50.620 --> 17:54.290
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Definitely an
oracle. Tells the future. Uh-oh.

17:54.457 --> 17:57.293
Girlfriend,
where were you registered?

17:57.460 --> 18:00.254
Okay, you know all,
so tell all.

18:00.421 --> 18:04.634
Where is the treasure?
You know, the ultimate one?

18:04.801 --> 18:09.722
I am bound by the rule of one.
One question, one answer.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.392
I only want one answer!

18:12.558 --> 18:16.229
Where is the ultimate treasure?

18:16.396 --> 18:19.148
You have already asked
your one question.

18:19.315 --> 18:24.279
You mean before?
Oh, that wasn't a question.

18:24.445 --> 18:26.114
Very loud.

18:26.280 --> 18:30.034
Aladdin, we could learn anything
about our lives, our future.

18:30.201 --> 18:32.161
You have but to ask.

18:32.328 --> 18:35.373
I know what my future is.
My future is you.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.793
But my past is a blank.

18:38.918 --> 18:43.339
My mother died when I was just a kid,
and I never even knew my father.

18:43.506 --> 18:45.842
I have no idea
where I come from.

18:45.967 --> 18:51.472
Your question is your choice,
but remember the rule of one.

18:51.639 --> 18:56.018
Oh, sure, she warns him about
the one question thing. Hey!

18:56.144 --> 19:00.690
I don't think you can help me.
My past isn't just one question;

19:00.815 --> 19:06.237
Ah, but mere questions about your past
can be answered by your father.

19:06.404 --> 19:08.489
My father?

19:17.248 --> 19:19.876
My father is alive?

19:34.182 --> 19:36.517
Abu? Where's Aladdin?

19:40.938 --> 19:42.774
How long has he been up there?

19:46.027 --> 19:48.321
Aladdin?

19:49.572 --> 19:51.824
Are you all right?

19:53.826 --> 19:56.913
- What's wrong?
- I always wanted to know

19:57.080 --> 19:59.874
but just now I'm not so sure.

19:59.999 --> 20:04.379
What kind of man leaves his son?
Did he even care?

20:04.545 --> 20:07.548
- Maybe I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

20:07.715 --> 20:10.385
How can you be so sure?

20:10.551 --> 20:13.596
Because I already know him.

20:13.763 --> 20:15.848
Because I know you.

20:17.934 --> 20:20.269
You showed me the world

20:20.436 --> 20:24.607
When I was all locked up inside

20:24.774 --> 20:27.276
You reached out your hand

20:27.443 --> 20:31.906
And took me on
a magic carpet ride

20:32.073 --> 20:34.284
One look at your smile

20:34.409 --> 20:37.203
And I could see the light

20:37.370 --> 20:41.124
Shining everywhere

20:41.290 --> 20:48.464
People like you
don't come out of thin air

20:49.632 --> 20:51.551
Oh, Jasmine.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.970
You don't understand

20:54.137 --> 20:58.433
There is so much
that you don't see

20:58.599 --> 21:00.768
Just think if you can

21:00.935 --> 21:05.189
What growing up
had to be like for me

21:05.356 --> 21:07.650
Your father's a man

21:07.775 --> 21:10.695
Who taught you who you are

21:10.862 --> 21:14.157
Mine was never there

21:14.282 --> 21:20.079
So how can you say
I don't come out of thin air

21:21.331 --> 21:24.667
There's so much I want to know

21:24.834 --> 21:27.670
You've got the chance to learn

21:27.837 --> 21:30.923
If it means I'd have to go

21:31.090 --> 21:38.181
I'll be right here
when you return

21:38.348 --> 21:40.350
- Our wedding can wait
- I love you

21:40.516 --> 21:44.520
- I think it's worth this small delay
- Maybe you're right

21:44.687 --> 21:47.190
And won't it be great

21:47.357 --> 21:50.526
To have your father see
our wedding day

21:50.693 --> 21:54.697
- I've waited so long
to learn the truth

21:54.864 --> 22:00.203
And now at last
we can finally say

22:00.370 --> 22:03.706
Your father is really there

22:03.831 --> 22:07.293
There's so much
that we might share

22:07.460 --> 22:09.837
And you'll finally learn

22:10.004 --> 22:18.680
- You don't come out of thin air
- Don't come out of thin air

22:29.899 --> 22:32.735
- Have you chosen your question?
- I have.

22:32.902 --> 22:35.738
Then ask.

22:35.905 --> 22:38.074
Where is my father?

22:38.241 --> 22:40.910
Follow the trail
of the Forty Thieves.

22:41.077 --> 22:44.914
Your father is trapped
within their world.

22:45.081 --> 22:48.584
The Forty Thieves? ls he hurt?
How long has he been their prisoner?

22:48.751 --> 22:53.423
I'm sorry. I can only
answer one question.

22:55.550 --> 22:58.261
- It's up to me.
- Take as long as you need.

23:00.346 --> 23:03.683
I'll be back in time
for our wedding. I promise.

23:11.065 --> 23:13.318
I should've stayed
with the genie.

23:13.484 --> 23:16.029
Manual labour beats danger
any day.

23:25.455 --> 23:28.374
Good. The trail's still fresh.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.460
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah!

23:31.836 --> 23:34.797
Definitely should've
stayed with the genie.

23:40.970 --> 23:43.306
Shh.

23:46.893 --> 23:50.104
Whew. Well, they have
nowhere to go.

23:50.271 --> 23:52.565
- We got 'em trapped.
- We?

23:52.732 --> 23:55.401
They are 40 thieves.

23:55.568 --> 23:59.989
We are you, a rug,
a monkey and me.

24:00.156 --> 24:03.743
- Wait, don't count me.
- They're just standing there.

24:07.997 --> 24:12.335
Open sesame!

24:41.197 --> 24:43.324
Hyah!

24:54.335 --> 24:56.212
- Let's move!
- Oh, oh! Aah!

24:58.798 --> 25:01.134
- Whoa!
- Hang on!

25:15.064 --> 25:17.942
I know, Carpet.
It's incredible. Wha--

25:19.819 --> 25:23.114
How bad is it?

25:30.913 --> 25:33.166
Yeow!

25:34.542 --> 25:37.920
Oh, this is attractive.

25:45.428 --> 25:47.263
Come on.

25:59.108 --> 26:00.943
Hey!

26:03.613 --> 26:05.698
You wanna not hold up traffic?

26:05.865 --> 26:08.785
I wanna get in, get out
and go home.

26:08.951 --> 26:12.288
Actually, I wouldn't mind
skipping right to the "go home."

26:12.455 --> 26:14.290
- We could've had all of
the loot at the wedding,

26:14.457 --> 26:17.293
but we followed the King's plan.

26:17.585 --> 26:21.714
This is what we have to show
for our trouble in Agrabah.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.716
- Nothing!
- Yeah! I agree.

26:23.883 --> 26:27.887
- This oughta be good.
- Sa'luk is truly ticked.

26:28.054 --> 26:32.350
Your time draws
to a close, Cassim.

26:32.517 --> 26:34.977
Cassim? My father.

26:35.144 --> 26:39.232
If you're talking about
spilling my blood, well, I

26:39.399 --> 26:42.235
Then let me open your eyes.

26:43.820 --> 26:45.655
- Huh?
- Run! I've got him.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.825
I'm Aladdin. You're my father!

26:50.159 --> 26:51.869
His father?

26:52.036 --> 26:54.706
I don't know
about your father, boy,

26:54.872 --> 26:58.334
but I'll send you to meet
your other ancestors.

26:58.501 --> 27:03.339
Let him go. The boy is my son.

27:03.506 --> 27:06.300
I gave this dagger
to my wife years ago.

27:06.467 --> 27:10.513
I told her to give it
to our newborn son, Aladdin.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.265
It's true?

27:12.432 --> 27:16.519
Oh, the boy is the son
of the King of Thieves.

27:16.686 --> 27:19.022
You are the King of Thieves?

27:19.188 --> 27:22.191
Like it or not, boy,
we are blood.

27:22.358 --> 27:26.195
Look at you. I thought
I'd never see you again.

27:26.362 --> 27:28.740
Has it been so long?

27:28.906 --> 27:31.701
Blood or mud,
the boy is an intruder,

27:31.868 --> 27:34.579
and we have rules
about intruders.

27:34.746 --> 27:37.498
- Sa'luk is right.
- He knows our secrets.

27:37.665 --> 27:39.876
- I hate intruders.
- Hey, me too.

27:40.043 --> 27:42.420
He has found our secret lair.

27:42.587 --> 27:44.631
He has seen too much.

27:48.092 --> 27:49.969
He must die.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.305
Yes!

27:52.472 --> 27:56.434
- They must all die.
- Die?

27:56.601 --> 27:59.479
He's your son. I'm his friend.

27:59.646 --> 28:02.398
Cast a vote for mercy here!

28:02.565 --> 28:06.486
Yes, Cassim, mercy
would be so like you.

28:06.653 --> 28:08.905
Soft and weak.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.496
- Maybe Sa'luk should be king.
- Maybe Sa'luk should be king.

28:18.081 --> 28:20.625
- Kill him.
- Huh?

28:23.419 --> 28:26.214
Or the boy could--

28:26.381 --> 28:29.967
Yes, the boy could-- No.

28:30.134 --> 28:32.136
- What? What? Th-The boy could what?
- Speak.

28:32.303 --> 28:36.015
- Nothing. Probably a bad idea.
- Let's hear it!

28:36.182 --> 28:39.143
Well, it seems to me that--
Oh, never mind.

28:39.310 --> 28:42.021
- What?
- Oh, no, please!

28:44.190 --> 28:47.318
The boy could face
the challenge.

28:47.485 --> 28:49.570
- Ahh!
- Oh, that's right, the challenge!

28:52.740 --> 28:56.160
That's that. My son
shall face the challenge.

28:56.327 --> 29:00.123
And I shall be the one
to test him.

29:00.289 --> 29:03.584
- Yeah!
- A test, huh? Ah, that's not so bad.

29:03.751 --> 29:06.129
Maybe it'll be multiple choice.

29:18.808 --> 29:21.185
Escape? Not likely.

29:21.352 --> 29:23.771
Our ride home is grounded,

29:23.938 --> 29:27.316
and Al-- well, it's been
nice knowin' him.

29:27.483 --> 29:30.778
- What's going on, Dad?
- Oh, the challenge is simple enough.

29:30.945 --> 29:33.948
Only one man survives.

29:35.867 --> 29:38.828
But you're my son.
You'll be that man.

29:38.995 --> 29:42.290
Knock him dead, kid. Seriously.

30:47.397 --> 30:49.482
No!

31:51.419 --> 31:53.463
I thought our side won!

31:53.629 --> 31:56.466
- Look, l-- I-l didn't mean--
- Get him!

31:56.633 --> 31:59.302
Take him to the King.

32:02.930 --> 32:04.599
Look, I don't even
know him, okay?

32:10.772 --> 32:16.027
You killed Sa'luk. The code of the Forty
Thieves is very clear on this point.

32:17.362 --> 32:21.699
- You're in.
- Hooray! Hooray!

32:21.866 --> 32:24.619
- Congratulations, bub
- You've joined the club

32:24.786 --> 32:26.871
And everybody here agrees

32:27.038 --> 32:30.541
We got the finest blend
of nearly-honest men

32:30.708 --> 32:32.794
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

32:32.961 --> 32:36.297
A fraternity of thugs
that you can trust

32:36.464 --> 32:38.841
There's nothing up
our 80 sleeves

32:39.008 --> 32:42.220
- Got lots of grub to share
- Pull up an easy chair

32:42.387 --> 32:45.139
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

32:45.306 --> 32:48.017
Now you get to lie and cheat

32:48.184 --> 32:51.020
Never have to brush your teeth

32:51.187 --> 32:53.648
But we always aim to please

32:53.815 --> 32:56.859
- Care for one another
- You'll never miss your mother

32:57.026 --> 32:59.737
Oh, I love you guys.

32:59.904 --> 33:02.699
Schemin' up a scam
out on the lam

33:02.865 --> 33:04.909
Takin' whatever we please

33:05.076 --> 33:08.538
- And if you like to lurk
- You're gonna love this work

33:08.705 --> 33:11.249
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

33:20.174 --> 33:23.219
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

33:23.386 --> 33:26.055
Together we're the perfect team

33:26.222 --> 33:28.766
Larceny is in the genes

33:28.933 --> 33:31.894
Dare to share the family dream

33:32.061 --> 33:36.107
Live a life of leisure
Countin' all your treasure

33:37.692 --> 33:41.279
As an honorary member
of the gang

33:41.446 --> 33:44.449
That no one alive ever leaves

33:44.616 --> 33:47.702
- You gotta snatch and sneak
- Or else your future's bleak

33:47.869 --> 33:50.955
We got a lifetime contract
that you're bound to keep

33:51.122 --> 33:54.667
You wanna save your skin
You'd better fit right in

33:54.834 --> 33:57.295
Well, well, welcome to the--
Well, well, welcome to the--

33:57.462 --> 34:00.381
Forty

34:00.548 --> 34:05.511
Thieves

34:36.751 --> 34:39.128
Boy. And I thought I was blue.

34:42.172 --> 34:45.967
You would know if Aladdin
is in trouble, wouldn't you?

34:46.135 --> 34:49.554
I thought he'd be back by now.

34:51.808 --> 34:53.393
AI will be back.

34:59.232 --> 35:02.068
Listen to Genie, dear.
Genie knows.

35:02.235 --> 35:07.031
You've got to get your mind off
this incessant waiting.

35:07.198 --> 35:09.701
Here's a sure-fire way to cheer
up a bummed-out bride-to-be.

35:09.867 --> 35:12.870
A heaping helping
of matrimonial magic.

35:20.420 --> 35:23.089
Hey, that's-a no good.
What the wedding needs is a theme.

35:23.214 --> 35:27.468
- It needs a groom too, but
let's work with what we have.

35:27.635 --> 35:31.389
It's a joke. I do that.

35:31.556 --> 35:35.184
Okay, let's see. This'll
be the second wedding for both of you.

35:35.351 --> 35:39.856
I'm thinking we need something
a little more simple, a little

35:40.023 --> 35:44.569
Did it, done it, own it.
I'm gonna throw some colours

35:44.736 --> 35:48.448
What do you like besides
the salmon? Okay, Madonna!

35:48.614 --> 35:52.368
Don't keep it. Just put that
in the mix. Wink. Okay.

35:52.535 --> 35:55.997
I see lasers! It's a miracle!

35:56.164 --> 35:59.292
He believes! He believes!

35:59.417 --> 36:02.420
- Thank you very much.
- I don't think so.

36:03.713 --> 36:05.757
Tres gauche, right?

36:07.759 --> 36:10.261
Hmm, maybe you--
you could elope.

36:10.386 --> 36:12.722
No, you "cantaloupe."
But oh, "honeydew"!

36:15.725 --> 36:18.561
I don't know whether to
put it under props or produce.

36:18.686 --> 36:22.523
Please don't squeeze the tyres. They're
not ripe. And how about that gown?

36:22.690 --> 36:25.693
Whether you're dancing with dwarfs
or simply biting the apple,

36:25.860 --> 36:28.613
it says,
"I'm a princess for now."

36:28.780 --> 36:32.075
- Uh, Genie.
- Hey, it's synergy.

36:32.241 --> 36:34.827
The marketing guys are very
excited. It tests really well.

36:34.994 --> 36:38.247
Thank you, Genie.
I'm sure it will be wonderful.

36:39.540 --> 36:42.502
And thanks for cheering me up.

36:42.669 --> 36:47.090
I'm sure Ali Baba and the boy
are on the road to Agrabah right

36:47.257 --> 36:51.177
That's right, Bing. How 'bout
this town? ls it wild or what?

36:51.344 --> 36:54.263
It's like one giant sand trap,
and me without my wedgie.

36:54.430 --> 36:57.392
Hey, let's give a big hand
for Brooke Shields.

36:59.393 --> 37:02.605
I find my son
and lose my enemy.

37:02.772 --> 37:04.941
You did your old man proud,
Aladdin.

37:05.066 --> 37:07.068
- I was just trying to stay alive.
- Huh!

37:07.193 --> 37:09.570
If you didn't fight,
you would've been killed.

37:09.737 --> 37:11.948
So says the code
of the Forty Thieves.

37:12.115 --> 37:15.827
Does this code have any rules
that don't end in death?

37:15.994 --> 37:18.288
It's a strict code.

37:18.454 --> 37:23.000
But there is one thing that I added.
We never hurt the innocent.

37:23.167 --> 37:25.169
Uh, for future reference,

37:25.336 --> 37:28.756
I'm as innocent
as the day I was hatched.

37:28.923 --> 37:31.926
Oh, brother!

37:32.093 --> 37:34.137
My men don't even know
about this place.

37:39.309 --> 37:42.895
Listen, boy,
there is a treasure,

37:43.062 --> 37:44.814
the ultimate treasure.

37:44.981 --> 37:48.318
Compared to this, a pharaoh's
tomb is a pauper's grave,

37:48.484 --> 37:51.404
a sultan's fortune
nothing but lunch money.

37:51.529 --> 37:54.657
And I am this close to it.

37:54.824 --> 37:58.161
That's tantalizingly close.

37:58.286 --> 38:02.290
But it's on an island that is
never in the same place twice.

38:02.415 --> 38:06.502
- The Vanishing lsle.
- That would be a problem.

38:06.627 --> 38:10.089
- What is this ultimate treasure?
- The big one, boy.

38:10.256 --> 38:13.259
The Hand of Midas.

38:13.384 --> 38:17.055
- It's just a myth.
- It's not a myth, boy!

38:17.221 --> 38:21.559
It was once right here.
Look, there's your proof.

38:21.726 --> 38:24.854
From stern to stem,
every piece of rigging,

38:25.021 --> 38:29.734
every peg and board,
all of it, solid gold!

38:29.901 --> 38:31.736
Ooh!

38:31.903 --> 38:35.406
Adopt me, daddy-o!

38:35.573 --> 38:39.702
- Touched by the Hand of Midas.
- And sunk by it.

38:39.869 --> 38:43.706
Oh, you don't understand. You don't know
what it's like to have nothing.

38:43.873 --> 38:47.251
To stare up at the palace
and know you deserve more.

38:49.212 --> 38:51.047
To be called "street rat."

38:52.382 --> 38:54.383
Yes, I do.

38:54.550 --> 38:58.221
I knew exactly what I wanted
for my family-- the best.

38:58.388 --> 39:01.307
I couldn't give up
and go back empty-handed.

39:01.474 --> 39:05.061
But the weeks turned into months,
and the months turned into years.

39:08.022 --> 39:10.608
I came back to Agrabah
one night,

39:10.733 --> 39:14.904
but I couldn't find my wife
or my son.

39:15.071 --> 39:19.492
I thought my family
was lost forever.

39:19.617 --> 39:24.914
At that moment, I would've traded
anything to get your mother back.

39:25.081 --> 39:28.960
We never wanted gold.
We wanted you.

39:30.336 --> 39:33.423
I wanted a father. I still do.

39:33.590 --> 39:37.635
Come to my wedding. This time,
you have an invitation.

39:37.802 --> 39:40.513
Aladdin, l-l just don't know.

39:40.680 --> 39:43.349
Dad, I'm not going back
to Agrabah until morning.

39:43.474 --> 39:45.810
At least think about it?

39:48.771 --> 39:52.609
Aladdin may never understand,
but it just wouldn't work.

39:52.775 --> 39:54.777
I don't belong in his world.

39:54.944 --> 39:58.865
The oracle doesn't belong
in his world either.

39:59.032 --> 40:02.702
It belongs in the hands of two
enterprising treasure hunters:

40:02.869 --> 40:05.455
you and me.

40:05.622 --> 40:09.042
The oracle. It's probably
just another dead end.

40:09.167 --> 40:12.670
It works! That's how
the kid found you.

40:12.795 --> 40:16.466
- It knows everything.
- Everything?

40:16.633 --> 40:18.801
And I know where
they stashed it.

40:18.968 --> 40:21.971
Cassim, we are talking about...

40:22.138 --> 40:25.141
the wedding of your only son.

40:25.266 --> 40:30.104
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

40:30.271 --> 40:32.649
How can I pass it up?

40:38.446 --> 40:41.657
- Captain, over here.
- Show yourself!

40:41.824 --> 40:45.286
You're alone. Good.

40:45.453 --> 40:49.082
So you are the one with information
about the Forty Thieves?

40:49.248 --> 40:52.418
What would you say
if I handed you...

40:52.585 --> 40:54.545
the King of Thieves?

40:54.712 --> 40:57.549
I'd say, "What in it for you?"

40:57.715 --> 41:01.719
I'll just sleep better knowing
that he's off the streets...

41:01.886 --> 41:04.055
and on the executioner's block.

41:04.222 --> 41:08.351
Everyone knows that the King
of Thieves cannot be caught.

41:08.518 --> 41:11.062
What miracle do you possess?

41:11.187 --> 41:15.233
Two words that will make you
Agrabah's greatest hero.

41:15.358 --> 41:17.860
Open sesame.

41:22.115 --> 41:24.367
- Hop on, Dad.
- Oh, no.

41:24.534 --> 41:28.746
It's a rug. You sweep dirt under it.
You don't fly on it. At least I don't.

41:28.872 --> 41:32.500
- Don't be afraid. It's fun.
- I am not afraid!

41:32.667 --> 41:38.214
- Now get off that thing
before you break your neck.

41:38.381 --> 41:42.385
- Give him time. He'll come around.
- We'll take horses.

41:42.552 --> 41:47.056
Horses were good enough
for my father and his father before him,

41:47.181 --> 41:49.726
and they were always
good enough for me.

41:49.893 --> 41:52.437
- He sounds like a father, all right.
- Uh-huh.

41:55.982 --> 41:59.110
Whoa! This is the spot, men.

42:00.820 --> 42:04.907
- But there is nothing here.
- Now. But watch.

42:07.118 --> 42:10.455
Open caraway!

42:14.917 --> 42:16.919
There is still nothing here.

42:17.086 --> 42:20.548
When I get ahold
of that no good--

42:20.715 --> 42:25.970
But I thought you said
it was "open sesame."

42:26.137 --> 42:28.473
Easy. Whoa. Whoa! Hey, hey!

42:39.609 --> 42:42.779
- Looks like Genie has everything ready.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

42:42.904 --> 42:46.949
Genie? You have a genie? Have
you used all three wishes yet?

42:47.075 --> 42:50.787
Oh, please, don't go into it.
It's just too painful.

42:50.954 --> 42:54.290
Oh, Al, you're back,
and your front!

42:54.415 --> 42:57.126
- You're both here!
- That's great, Genie. Uh--

42:57.293 --> 42:59.629
No big crowd.
Immediate family only.

42:59.796 --> 43:04.008
- Perfect, because this is my--
- No lowlifes this time, other

43:04.175 --> 43:06.844
Observe.

43:13.393 --> 43:16.396
You have violated the perimeter
of the Aladdin and Jasmine wedding.

43:16.562 --> 43:18.731
Prepare to be vaporized.
Thank you.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.986
Armed and dangerous.

43:23.111 --> 43:25.905
I'd like to see one of those
Forty Thieves get within

43:26.072 --> 43:29.117
Allow me to introduce--

43:29.283 --> 43:31.995
The King of Thieves.

43:32.161 --> 43:35.331
- All units, we have a code red.
- Code red! Code red!

43:35.498 --> 43:37.542
Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red!

43:37.667 --> 43:40.670
Code red! Code red!

43:40.795 --> 43:45.174
Code red! Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red!

43:45.341 --> 43:47.885
Come on, boys. Follow me.

43:50.346 --> 43:54.267
- Cavalry, forward!
- Code red! Code red! Code red!

43:54.392 --> 43:58.521
- Geronimo!
- Arapaho!

43:58.688 --> 44:00.898
- Code red! Code red! Code red!
- C-C-C-C-C-Code red! C-C-C-C-C--

44:01.065 --> 44:04.861
- Code red!
- Do not attempt to move, or

44:05.028 --> 44:08.948
- Genie!
- Back off, Al. This creep's got a

44:09.115 --> 44:11.451
Genie, meet my dad.

44:14.370 --> 44:17.623
Stand down, men.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

44:17.790 --> 44:20.251
If you're Al's dad...

44:20.418 --> 44:22.962
and the King of Thieves,

44:23.129 --> 44:26.424
- I just want to know one thing.
- Yeah?

44:26.591 --> 44:29.385
Will you be having
the chicken or the sea bass?

44:29.552 --> 44:33.056
Come on, Dad. I can't wait
for you to meet Jasmine and the Sultan.

44:33.222 --> 44:37.018
Ahem, Al. Don't you think we oughta
lose the "Agrabah's Most Wanted" Iook?

44:37.143 --> 44:41.272
- What's wrong with the way I look?
- When you're here, you're

44:41.439 --> 44:43.566
You're my dad.

44:43.733 --> 44:47.904
Mmm, I had more practise
being the King of Thieves.

44:48.029 --> 44:50.490
Oh, come on.
Enough of this dark past.

44:50.656 --> 44:53.493
Let's roll out something
a little new.

44:53.660 --> 44:56.079
It's a big, bright
beautiful future

44:56.246 --> 44:58.748
Thank your lucky stars
you're alive

44:58.915 --> 45:01.876
You got someone special
to talk to

45:02.043 --> 45:04.420
A friend that you
can trust for life

45:04.587 --> 45:07.048
You've been on your own
with no family ties

45:07.215 --> 45:09.884
But those solo days are done

45:10.051 --> 45:14.681
You'll be two of a kind
spending quality time together

45:14.847 --> 45:17.517
As father and son

45:17.642 --> 45:20.103
Building model ships

45:20.269 --> 45:22.772
Takin' fishin' trips

45:22.939 --> 45:24.983
Workin' hand in hand

45:27.110 --> 45:29.445
Painting the palace
Mowin' the sand

45:29.612 --> 45:33.825
First and ten to go,
with your daddy-o!

45:33.992 --> 45:37.203
Once you break the ice

45:37.370 --> 45:40.456
You can postulate
paternal advice

45:40.623 --> 45:45.503
I see you're travelling at the speed of
light. That's the theory of relatives.

45:45.670 --> 45:48.339
It's a fine
"fantabulous" future

45:48.506 --> 45:50.967
I see fruit on the family tree

45:51.134 --> 45:53.636
You'll be great
as a grumpy old grandpa

45:53.803 --> 45:56.472
Bouncin' babies on your knee

45:56.639 --> 45:58.975
You can fall asleep
on the comfy couch

45:59.142 --> 46:02.061
After playin' one-on-one

46:02.228 --> 46:05.315
Dreaming back to back
that you walloped the Shaq

46:05.481 --> 46:08.234
Together as father and son

46:09.402 --> 46:12.113
May be a bumpy ride

46:12.280 --> 46:15.658
We'll make it side by side

46:15.825 --> 46:18.578
Good afternoon.
I'll be your travel guide!

46:18.745 --> 46:21.164
Move over, laddie
Make room for Daddy

46:21.331 --> 46:23.833
Got a whole new shoulder
to cry on

46:24.000 --> 46:26.669
Take a chance now
Give it a spin

46:26.836 --> 46:29.339
You've had chums
for pallin' around with

46:29.505 --> 46:32.175
But you never had
a friend like him

46:32.341 --> 46:34.844
Put your checkered past
behind you now

46:35.011 --> 46:37.680
No more living on the run

46:37.847 --> 46:40.683
Face the big, bright
beautiful future

46:40.850 --> 46:45.188
- Together
- Together

46:45.355 --> 46:48.691
As father and son

46:53.279 --> 46:57.033
My boy Aladdin must be born
under a lucky star...

46:57.200 --> 46:59.369
to find such a treasure.

46:59.535 --> 47:02.539
You are most definitely
Aladdin's father.

47:02.705 --> 47:06.250
-And I have the DNA to prove it.
-Oh, it must have been dreadful.

47:06.417 --> 47:09.545
- Trapped by the Forty Thieves.
- Uh-oh.

47:09.712 --> 47:12.257
I try to block out the memories.

47:12.423 --> 47:15.843
Say no more. Not another word
on the subject.

47:16.010 --> 47:19.055
Yes, let's turn our attention
to happier thoughts.

47:19.222 --> 47:22.725
- The blessed union of our children.
- Indeed.

47:22.892 --> 47:24.727
It worked, Genie.
They love him.

47:24.894 --> 47:27.897
It was the hat. Nothing does
the trick like a smart chapeau.

47:28.064 --> 47:30.566
- It's more than that.
- Ah, to be back among

47:30.733 --> 47:35.363
- Back among family.
- All he needed was a second chance.

47:35.613 --> 47:38.324
- You'll pay for this!
- You traitor!

47:38.491 --> 47:42.870
- My nose!
- He's not in there!

47:43.037 --> 47:45.123
You didn't capture
the King of Thieves?

47:45.289 --> 47:47.959
Because he was not
at the hideout!

47:48.084 --> 47:50.461
He had to be there.
Where else would he be?

47:50.628 --> 47:53.756
- Uh, apologies, Captain Rasoul.
- What?

47:53.923 --> 47:58.261
Well, the Sultan said
he won't be able to sentence

47:58.428 --> 48:01.931
What's more important
than sentencing my prisoners?

48:02.098 --> 48:06.811
Why, the wedding. Princess Jasmine and
Aladdin are finally getting married.

48:06.978 --> 48:10.565
Aladdin? You didn't capture
Aladdin with the others?

48:10.732 --> 48:13.526
Why would he be with
the Forty Thieves?

48:13.693 --> 48:17.822
Because his father is
the King of Thieves!

48:19.991 --> 48:23.828
Ooh, where can he be?
Oh, I do hope nothing's wrong.

48:23.995 --> 48:26.706
Perhaps we should dispatch
a search party, hmm?

48:26.873 --> 48:30.626
Now, Father, I'm sure
he's on his way.

48:30.793 --> 48:34.756
- Where is he?
- Hakuna matata.

48:34.923 --> 48:38.217
Whoa! I was having
an out-of-movie experience.

48:38.384 --> 48:42.221
My guess is he wants
to make an entrance.

48:45.808 --> 48:51.230
Here's the monkey's lock picks.
You know how to use 'em?

48:51.397 --> 48:55.485
I promise you, bird,
after this I go straight.

48:55.652 --> 48:57.820
Straight to the dungeon.

49:03.159 --> 49:05.703
We've been expecting you.

49:17.549 --> 49:20.593
Do you think something is wrong?

49:20.760 --> 49:23.429
- Genie, can you find him?
- I'll sniff him out.

49:27.517 --> 49:31.396
I need a scrap of his clothes
or a lock of his hair or a shoe.

49:31.562 --> 49:35.066
A shoe's good.

49:35.233 --> 49:39.195
- Huh?
- Ohh!

49:39.362 --> 49:42.865
Your Majesty, meet
the King of Thieves.

49:43.032 --> 49:45.368
- Dad!
- We seized him in the treasury.

49:45.535 --> 49:49.414
- He was after this again.
- No.

49:49.581 --> 49:52.250
And this is his accomplice.

49:52.417 --> 49:54.585
Big misunderstanding!

49:54.752 --> 49:58.089
It's a slap on the wrist and,
uh, community service kind of thing.

49:58.256 --> 50:00.508
Now I know why
you really came back.

50:02.427 --> 50:06.764
Your father is the leader
of the Forty Thieves?

50:06.931 --> 50:09.851
B-B-B-But this is most p--

50:10.018 --> 50:13.146
Aladdin, did you know?

50:13.312 --> 50:16.274
I thought I could change him.
I had to try.

50:16.441 --> 50:20.486
You can change my clothes, Aladdin.
You can't change who I am.

50:20.653 --> 50:24.782
And the law is crystal clear
on what we must now do.

50:24.949 --> 50:28.286
Father, isn't there
another way?

50:28.453 --> 50:33.207
I'm afraid there is not. Take
the prisoners to the dungeon.

50:33.374 --> 50:35.626
- Dungeon?
- For life.

50:35.793 --> 50:39.631
Life?

50:39.797 --> 50:43.301
There are some wishes that
even I can't make come true.

50:49.474 --> 50:54.270
The oracle was right. My dad was trapped
in the world of the Forty Thieves.

50:54.437 --> 50:58.149
Trapped by his own greed. I was
so stupid to think I could change him.

50:58.316 --> 51:01.486
Trying to show him a better life
wasn't stupid, Al.

51:01.653 --> 51:03.738
Leaving him alone with the
parrot, that was stupid.

51:03.905 --> 51:07.325
Everything was perfect
before he came into my life.

51:07.492 --> 51:10.495
I just want things
the way they were.

51:10.662 --> 51:12.789
Genie, I need
my father's clothes.

51:12.956 --> 51:16.834
A-A-A-Al, what, did you
wrap the turban too tight?

51:17.001 --> 51:21.547
Come on! Why you wanna dress
in the King of Thieves ensemble?

51:21.714 --> 51:24.592
Might I suggest something
that doesn't actually say, "Arrest me!"

51:24.759 --> 51:27.679
It fits. Good.

51:27.845 --> 51:31.849
I'm seeing-- I'm seeing nothing
for your future if you dress like this!

51:32.016 --> 51:37.188
I'm breaking my father out
of that dungeon. The guards

51:37.355 --> 51:42.151
Tonight the King of Thieves will
make his most miraculous escape ever.

51:42.318 --> 51:44.695
Out of my life!

51:44.862 --> 51:47.323
It's the cape talking, isn't it?

52:09.220 --> 52:13.641
Since he's captured the King of
Thieves, there's no living with Rasoul.

52:13.808 --> 52:18.187
Well, it wasn't exactly easy
living with him before.

52:31.576 --> 52:34.621
- Who?
- I've come to say goodbye.

52:34.787 --> 52:37.081
- Why are you--
- We don't have much time.

52:37.248 --> 52:39.917
While the guards chase me,
you get out.

52:40.084 --> 52:42.754
- I can't let you--
- Forget it.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.923
They can't catch me.

52:46.758 --> 52:49.594
He even sounds like me.

52:51.721 --> 52:54.682
When the Sultan gives me my due,

52:54.849 --> 52:59.312
I'll put the good word in
for you, the little people who--

53:00.730 --> 53:04.067
It can't be.

53:09.238 --> 53:11.074
He was here. I know it.

53:14.327 --> 53:18.706
- The King of Thieves!
- No man could've escaped that cell.

53:18.873 --> 53:23.419
He-- He isn't a man, I say.
He's a demon!

53:23.586 --> 53:27.048
I want him, dead or alive.

53:30.802 --> 53:34.639
Surround the block!
He's close. I can feel it.

53:34.806 --> 53:38.142
- Well, which way did he go?
- I don't see him.

53:38.309 --> 53:40.478
Look over there. Hurry!

53:49.279 --> 53:52.532
There! The King of Thieves
on the roof!

53:52.699 --> 53:55.118
Get up there! Now! Now! Now!

53:57.579 --> 53:59.622
- Found him!
- Lost him.

54:04.168 --> 54:06.337
- Which way did he go?
- I heard him over there.

54:06.504 --> 54:08.339
- Over there!
- There!

54:13.761 --> 54:15.596
Gotcha!

54:19.434 --> 54:21.727
The King of Thieves.

54:21.894 --> 54:26.149
Your charmed life is over,
Your Majesty!

54:28.610 --> 54:30.987
You!

54:31.154 --> 54:33.656
Yes.

54:33.823 --> 54:37.160
Well, I guess I'll have
to settle for the Prince of Thieves.

54:37.327 --> 54:41.289
We shall see if the Sultan
wants you in his family now.

54:45.460 --> 54:47.629
Keep your hands off my son!

54:47.795 --> 54:52.050
- Dad?
- Hurry, son. We must move.

55:12.487 --> 55:16.574
- Did we lose him?
- I don't know, but I did

55:16.741 --> 55:19.410
They won't be able to pick up
our trail 'til daylight.

55:19.577 --> 55:22.580
By then, we'll be
long gone from Agrabah.

55:28.503 --> 55:31.673
I'm sorry for what you lost.

55:31.839 --> 55:35.510
But you can't go back now.
You know that. What are you doing?

55:35.676 --> 55:38.596
I'm not going with you. I can't.

55:38.763 --> 55:43.518
Well, you can't go back.
The moment they saw your face,

55:43.685 --> 55:46.437
I have to go back.
Jasmine is there.

55:46.604 --> 55:49.440
Kid, it's over.
You're a criminal now.

55:49.607 --> 55:53.152
I won't do what he did.
I won't run away.

55:53.319 --> 55:57.281
- I never ran away
from anything in my life.

55:57.448 --> 56:02.120
I told you what happened. What else
could I do? What else can you do?

56:02.287 --> 56:04.956
The right thing.
You should take this back.

56:05.123 --> 56:10.461
- You can't!
- I won't walk out on Jasmine.

56:10.586 --> 56:14.424
- Aladdin.
- I'm your son, but I can't

56:14.591 --> 56:16.884
Al, they'll lock ya up.

56:17.051 --> 56:19.137
If there's a punishment,
I'll take it.

56:19.303 --> 56:22.765
- So be it.
- We have the oracle!

56:22.932 --> 56:28.187
- The treasure's just waiting for us.
- The oracle?

56:28.354 --> 56:33.151
- I had nothing left to lose.
- Yes, you did.

56:35.403 --> 56:38.614
It was supposed to be
a father-son outing.

56:40.325 --> 56:42.660
- Go with him, lago.
- What?

56:42.827 --> 56:44.787
You mean it? Really?

56:44.954 --> 56:46.831
Go.

56:46.998 --> 56:49.709
Good luck, kid.

56:59.177 --> 57:03.640
From 40 thieves down to 7.
What are we to do?

57:03.806 --> 57:07.685
How did they find us? How did
they learn the magic words?

57:11.064 --> 57:14.567
- Another raid?
- Not again.

57:14.734 --> 57:16.778
It is a good day to die.

57:16.945 --> 57:20.198
Or to come back from the dead.

57:20.365 --> 57:25.036
- Sa'luk?
- You're alive?

57:25.203 --> 57:27.872
I'm a survivor, like all of you.

57:28.039 --> 57:30.041
No thanks to Cassim.

57:30.208 --> 57:34.212
- The King?
- You saw him?

57:34.379 --> 57:37.549
He wants you to rot
in the palace dungeon.

57:37.715 --> 57:41.386
Bah! The King of Thieves
is loyal to the end.

57:41.552 --> 57:43.721
- Pushovers!
- Ouch!

57:43.888 --> 57:47.058
He betrayed you, sold you out.

57:47.225 --> 57:51.896
You have always hated the King.
Why should we believe you?

57:52.063 --> 57:55.566
How do you think the guard
got the magic words?

57:55.733 --> 57:58.736
He told him the magic words?

57:58.903 --> 58:03.866
- I don't believe it.
- Me neither.

58:04.033 --> 58:07.036
You've forgotten what life
was like before Cassim.

58:09.581 --> 58:12.417
I remember a time
when crime was sublime

58:12.583 --> 58:15.378
There was plenty of loot
in the lair

58:15.545 --> 58:18.381
We'd plunder and pillage
and ransack a village

58:18.548 --> 58:21.050
With nary a worry or care

58:21.217 --> 58:23.928
Then along came this king
with his soft-hearted dream

58:24.095 --> 58:26.639
But he ratted us out in the end

58:26.806 --> 58:29.767
So rally the troops
We were meant to regroup

58:29.934 --> 58:32.228
And return to our roots
once again

58:32.395 --> 58:35.565
Are you in or out

58:35.732 --> 58:38.443
Gotta know without a doubt

58:38.610 --> 58:41.279
I'm the one you need
for a dirty deed

58:41.446 --> 58:43.948
I'm the best
Success is guaranteed

58:44.115 --> 58:46.784
Are you men or mice

58:46.909 --> 58:49.412
Take a slice of my advice

58:49.579 --> 58:52.415
You want a fearless leader
One that's strong and stout

58:52.582 --> 58:55.460
Better vote for me
Are you in or out

58:58.338 --> 59:00.840
- We used to be smart
- Yes, horrendously heartless

59:01.007 --> 59:03.801
In a ravaging raid
we were rough

59:03.968 --> 59:06.387
We knew that we had to
be blissfully bad

59:06.554 --> 59:08.973
Then Cassim brought
this sensitive stuff

59:09.140 --> 59:11.976
And we strayed from the path
of our rigorous wrath

59:12.143 --> 59:14.645
- Now we're taking a bath in the dust
- Huh?

59:14.812 --> 59:17.690
But we'll reclaim our winnings
Our humble beginnings

59:17.857 --> 59:21.277
In turmoil and torture we trust

59:21.444 --> 59:24.822
Are you in or out

59:24.989 --> 59:27.533
Double-crossers or devout

59:27.700 --> 59:30.453
Put your faith in me
Pretty soon you'll see

59:30.620 --> 59:33.164
I'm the prince of generosity

59:33.331 --> 59:36.000
Are you foe or friend

59:36.167 --> 59:38.503
Here's the path I recommend

59:38.670 --> 59:41.339
You wanna ride to fame
I've got the fastest route

59:41.506 --> 59:44.509
What's it gonna be
Are you in or out

59:47.095 --> 59:50.181
We'll go robbing
in all the right places

59:50.348 --> 59:52.934
From Agrabah dunes to Paris

59:53.101 --> 59:55.561
Imagine the fear on their faces

59:55.728 --> 59:58.940
When we drop by
for cookies and tea

59:59.107 --> 01:00:02.193
Come along, boys. Follow me!

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.154
Are you in or out

01:00:05.321 --> 01:00:08.074
- If you're with me give a shout
- Yeah!

01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:10.910
I'll lead you all the way
into the glory days

01:00:11.035 --> 01:00:13.621
We'll begin a life of crime
that pays

01:00:13.788 --> 01:00:16.040
Are you out or in

01:00:16.207 --> 01:00:18.876
Make your choice now
Sink or swim

01:00:19.043 --> 01:00:21.796
You can stick with me
or stay behind and pout

01:00:21.963 --> 01:00:24.257
What's it gonna be

01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:27.009
Consider carefully

01:00:27.176 --> 01:00:29.137
Are you in

01:00:29.303 --> 01:00:33.391
Or out

01:00:36.602 --> 01:00:39.564
I know the treasure's limitless,

01:00:39.731 --> 01:00:42.734
but I'm not crazy
about a 40-way split.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.153
If it was just, uh, you and me--

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.739
I would never cut my men
out of the deal.

01:00:47.905 --> 01:00:50.825
They're my family,
my only family.

01:00:50.992 --> 01:00:52.994
I can always count on them.

01:01:04.213 --> 01:01:06.174
I'm home!

01:01:20.104 --> 01:01:23.149
Why don't they
look happy to see you?

01:01:23.316 --> 01:01:27.111
We are. We're thrilled.

01:01:34.035 --> 01:01:37.872
- Hurry, little friend.
- I'm wriggling. I'm wriggling.

01:01:38.039 --> 01:01:43.378
I am growing impatient, Cassim.
Ask the question.

01:01:43.544 --> 01:01:46.381
- We must be, uh--
- Just a little further.

01:01:46.547 --> 01:01:48.800
Further out to sea.

01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:52.637
- No. Ask it now!
- Now's good.

01:01:52.804 --> 01:01:56.975
Where can we find
the Hand of Midas?

01:02:04.315 --> 01:02:07.277
The Vanishing lsle
will appear at dawn.

01:02:07.443 --> 01:02:11.239
I will show you the way!

01:02:11.406 --> 01:02:13.825
There's your setting, Captain.

01:02:25.128 --> 01:02:28.381
Frankly, my boy, your actions
were most disappointing.

01:02:28.548 --> 01:02:31.384
It is tragic, Your Highness,
but the street rat...

01:02:31.551 --> 01:02:34.804
has obviously followed
in his father's footsteps.

01:02:34.971 --> 01:02:38.558
Aladdin is a criminal.

01:02:38.725 --> 01:02:41.811
I object, Your Honour.

01:02:43.563 --> 01:02:45.857
I object to that
outrageous statement...

01:02:46.024 --> 01:02:49.652
and I object to a tertiary
character having any lines

01:02:49.819 --> 01:02:53.114
Here, take this to
a higher court. Ciao!

01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:55.950
Your Honour, if I may enter
a plea of insanity,

01:02:56.075 --> 01:02:58.912
because I'm crazy
about this kid.

01:02:59.078 --> 01:03:02.498
Genie, I can handle this myself.

01:03:02.665 --> 01:03:06.002
Sultan, I convinced my dad
to come here.

01:03:06.169 --> 01:03:08.880
It was my fault.

01:03:09.047 --> 01:03:11.716
I would have been better off
if I had never known him.

01:03:11.883 --> 01:03:14.427
Aladdin, you found your father,

01:03:14.594 --> 01:03:17.555
a father who risked his freedom
to see your wedding.

01:03:17.722 --> 01:03:21.184
And you risked everything
to help him,

01:03:21.351 --> 01:03:24.353
just as I would for my father.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.815
Your father. Uh-- Oh, yeah.

01:03:27.982 --> 01:03:30.151
Uh, well-- Uh--

01:03:30.318 --> 01:03:34.822
Aladdin, I could not overlook
your father's crimes,

01:03:34.989 --> 01:03:37.075
but what you have done,

01:03:37.241 --> 01:03:40.495
well, you did it out of love.

01:03:40.662 --> 01:03:45.249
And you came back to take
responsibility for your actions.

01:03:45.416 --> 01:03:48.753
Let us put
this matter behind us.

01:03:50.463 --> 01:03:54.550
I believe we have postponed
the wedding long enough.

01:03:54.717 --> 01:03:59.555
Good call! Okay, let's give a big hand
for the wise and generous Sultan! Yes!

01:04:05.728 --> 01:04:09.732
- Al's-- dad-- Sa'luk--
- Just take a deep breath, lago.

01:04:09.899 --> 01:04:14.028
- Now, what about Aladdin's father?
- It's Sa'luk, the guy AI beat.

01:04:14.195 --> 01:04:18.783
He's not beat. He's back,
and he's got Cassim.

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:22.620
That's his problem. He chose
to go back to that life.

01:04:22.787 --> 01:04:27.625
Al, I know your dad made
a lot of bad choices, but that

01:04:27.792 --> 01:04:31.421
He is your father.
How can you do anything else?

01:04:34.591 --> 01:04:37.301
I'm being as stubborn as he was.

01:04:38.928 --> 01:04:41.264
Show me the way.

01:04:54.319 --> 01:04:56.737
Yeah.

01:05:07.957 --> 01:05:10.168
You have arrived.

01:05:15.423 --> 01:05:17.300
- Help!
- Where is it?

01:05:17.467 --> 01:05:19.927
- I see nothing.
- Nothing but fog.

01:05:20.094 --> 01:05:23.431
- I've had enough of your trickery!
- No, this is it.

01:05:23.598 --> 01:05:26.851
The Vanishing lsle. Watch.

01:05:38.362 --> 01:05:40.198
Look out!

01:06:18.403 --> 01:06:22.532
- The Vanishing lsle.
- On the back of a giant turtle.

01:06:22.699 --> 01:06:26.869
And never in the same place
twice. Let's get closer.

01:06:36.921 --> 01:06:39.716
Time to rock and roll, dude!

01:07:01.612 --> 01:07:03.281
Now I am here. I am here.

01:07:06.492 --> 01:07:09.245
- Huh?
- How 'bout a packet of Nutty Buddies?

01:07:12.039 --> 01:07:15.960
- Genie, we need a distraction.
- Survey says,

01:07:16.127 --> 01:07:19.714
"Show me turtle"!

01:07:21.883 --> 01:07:25.136
Boom! Another fake blow
to the head! Boom!

01:07:25.303 --> 01:07:28.973
Oh, no, he's got him in the half nelson.
Now he's got him in the full nelson!

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.517
Oh, no! The dreaded
Ozzie Nelson!

01:07:31.684 --> 01:07:34.645
Rick, boys, maybe you wanna
come over here and see what's happening?

01:07:34.812 --> 01:07:37.649
He's comin' in quick.
Oh, no, he's up! He's down.

01:07:37.815 --> 01:07:40.485
And he's actually
inside the turtle.

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:43.404
We'll be right back
after a brief message.

01:07:45.031 --> 01:07:46.866
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:59.504
It took me years to find my father.
I'm not losing him again.

01:08:07.345 --> 01:08:10.723
- You came to help me?
- How could I do anything else?

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.353
Now, let's get that
treasure of yours.

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:26.531
Amazing!

01:08:36.624 --> 01:08:38.459
There!

01:08:41.671 --> 01:08:44.048
Whoa.

01:08:44.215 --> 01:08:48.845
- Feels like Genie got carried away.
- No! It's the Vanishing lsle.

01:08:49.011 --> 01:08:52.098
The turtle is diving.
We must climb higher!

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.154
We're almost there!

01:09:07.321 --> 01:09:11.158
Don't you see, Aladdin?
We were meant to do this together.

01:09:11.325 --> 01:09:12.785
Come on!

01:09:51.323 --> 01:09:54.368
Pity I didn't find this place
years ago.

01:09:54.535 --> 01:09:58.456
This would be much easier
if I were much younger.

01:09:59.958 --> 01:10:01.834
Aladdin!

01:10:12.303 --> 01:10:15.306
See? It pays to have
a junior partner.

01:10:15.473 --> 01:10:18.142
Be careful. Don't touch
the golden hand.

01:10:27.318 --> 01:10:29.654
Heads up.

01:10:44.085 --> 01:10:47.839
The Hand of Midas!

01:11:14.824 --> 01:11:16.033
Time to go, Aladdin!

01:11:18.703 --> 01:11:21.664
Nobody's going anywhere.

01:11:21.831 --> 01:11:25.919
Give the Hand of Midas to me,
Cassim, or your son dies.

01:11:26.085 --> 01:11:30.381
-Sa'luk, your battle is with me!
-Don't worry, Dad. I can take him alone.

01:11:30.548 --> 01:11:33.426
But you're not alone,
not any more.

01:11:33.551 --> 01:11:36.095
You want the Hand of Midas,
Sa'luk?

01:11:36.262 --> 01:11:38.723
Take it!

01:11:49.192 --> 01:11:52.820
The Hand of Midas is mine!

01:11:52.987 --> 01:11:56.657
And also, the life of your brat.

01:11:59.744 --> 01:12:02.330
What are you staring at?

01:12:03.289 --> 01:12:05.416
Oh. No! No!

01:12:05.583 --> 01:12:07.418
No! No!

01:12:29.691 --> 01:12:33.695
Hurry, son.
We're running out of time.

01:12:51.296 --> 01:12:53.131
Come on, Dad. You can do it.

01:12:53.298 --> 01:12:57.802
Yes. But it would be
a lot easier without this.

01:13:11.774 --> 01:13:14.944
After all these years,
you finally have your treasure.

01:13:15.111 --> 01:13:18.072
This thing? No.

01:13:18.239 --> 01:13:21.325
This wretched thing almost
cost me the ultimate treasure.

01:13:21.492 --> 01:13:26.998
It's you, son.
You are my ultimate treasure.

01:13:27.123 --> 01:13:30.126
I'm just sorry it took me
this long to realize it.

01:13:30.251 --> 01:13:35.507
The Hand of Midas can take its
curse to the bottom of the sea!

01:13:46.684 --> 01:13:49.687
It's gold. It's turned
everything to solid gold.

01:13:51.564 --> 01:13:54.818
Oh, we are sinking!

01:14:04.202 --> 01:14:07.538
I didn't see where they went,
and they could be anywhere!

01:14:07.705 --> 01:14:10.583
There they are.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.419
Get up here, you blasted rug!

01:14:16.548 --> 01:14:20.551
- You actually trust this thing?
- With my life, son.

01:14:28.017 --> 01:14:29.268
Genie!

01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:45.910
- Genie!
- Present!

01:14:46.077 --> 01:14:49.789
Let's go home. We have
some unfinished business.

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:19.611
Yes!

01:15:47.346 --> 01:15:51.476
Out in the open? No mask?
Pretty risky, if you ask me.

01:15:51.642 --> 01:15:55.772
Even a wanted man can risk a bit
to see his own son's wedding.

01:15:55.939 --> 01:15:59.984
So, you little turkey,
come to say goodbye?

01:16:00.151 --> 01:16:02.654
Nah, I already said
my goodbyes.

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:08.159
Of course, the monkey had
to cry, and that got me goin'.

01:16:08.326 --> 01:16:11.662
- You're not gonna live in the palace?
- With the newlyweds?

01:16:11.829 --> 01:16:16.501
It'll be all lovey-dovey.
I'd just as soon keep my will to live.

01:16:16.668 --> 01:16:18.837
Well, I don't know
where I'm going,

01:16:19.003 --> 01:16:22.507
but you are welcome
to come along for the ride.

01:16:22.674 --> 01:16:24.842
You're a good guy, Cassim.

01:16:25.009 --> 01:16:29.263
But not too good.

01:16:32.183 --> 01:16:35.353
So it goes short and sweet
They were wed down the street

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.731
May their marriage
be truly blessed

01:16:38.898 --> 01:16:42.026
Happy end to the tale
And tomorrow's a sale

01:16:42.152 --> 01:16:45.279
So I'd better go home and rest

01:16:45.446 --> 01:16:48.699
Here's a kiss and a hug
Sure you don't need a rug

01:16:48.866 --> 01:16:51.452
I assure you the price is right

01:16:51.577 --> 01:16:55.665
Well, Salaam, worthy friend
Come back soon, that's the end

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:58.042
'Til another

01:16:58.209 --> 01:17:10.388
Arabian night

01:19:34.031 --> 01:19:36.701
- Congratulations, bub
- You've joined the club

01:19:36.868 --> 01:19:39.328
And everybody here agrees

01:19:39.454 --> 01:19:42.665
We got the finest blend
of nearly-honest men

01:19:42.832 --> 01:19:45.335
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:48.421
A fraternity of thugs
that you can trust

01:19:48.588 --> 01:19:50.882
There's nothing up
our 80 sleeves

01:19:51.049 --> 01:19:54.468
- Got lots of grub to share
- Pull up an easy chair

01:19:54.635 --> 01:19:57.305
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

01:19:57.472 --> 01:20:00.224
Now you get to lie and cheat

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:03.061
Never have to brush your teeth

01:20:03.227 --> 01:20:06.105
But we always aim to please

01:20:06.272 --> 01:20:09.275
- Care for one another
- You'll never miss your mother

01:20:09.442 --> 01:20:11.986
Oh, I love you guys!

01:20:12.153 --> 01:20:14.989
Schemin' up a scam
out on the lam

01:20:15.156 --> 01:20:17.325
Takin' whatever we please

01:20:17.492 --> 01:20:20.745
- And if you like to lurk
- You're gonna love this work

01:20:20.912 --> 01:20:23.581
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:35.384
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

01:20:35.551 --> 01:20:38.304
Together we're the perfect team

01:20:38.471 --> 01:20:41.224
Larceny is in the genes

01:20:41.391 --> 01:20:44.143
Dare to share the family dream

01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:47.605
Live a life of leisure
Countin' all your treasure

01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:53.778
As an honorary member
of the gang

01:20:53.945 --> 01:20:56.822
That no one alive ever leaves

01:20:56.989 --> 01:21:00.076
- You gotta snatch and sneak
- Or else your future's bleak

01:21:00.243 --> 01:21:03.287
We got a lifetime contract
that you're bound to keep

01:21:03.454 --> 01:21:06.708
You wanna save your skin
You'd better fit right in

01:21:06.874 --> 01:21:09.669
Well, well, welcome to the--
Well, well, welcome to the--

Thieves

01:21:19.011 --> 01:21:22.140
Wait a minute. We're not
gettin' outta here, man!

01:21:22.306 --> 01:21:26.102

Don't ya understand it, man?
