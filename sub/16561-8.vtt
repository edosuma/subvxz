WEBVTT

00:05.349 --> 00:07.376
Have you seen this person?

00:07.401 --> 00:09.487
His name is Danny.

00:11.948 --> 00:14.049
- He maybe found a shelter.
- Maybe.

00:14.084 --> 00:15.992
Or he could be riding
the train all night

00:16.017 --> 00:17.215
to stay warm.

00:17.622 --> 00:19.512
Ethan,
if you're trying to make me feel better,

00:19.537 --> 00:20.801
- it's not gonna work.
- I'm not.

00:20.826 --> 00:23.186
I'm just saying, we
can't look everywhere,

00:23.211 --> 00:24.531
and it's time to go to work.

00:24.556 --> 00:26.826
Well, you go ahead.
I'm gonna keep looking.

00:27.749 --> 00:30.094
Um, excuse me.

00:30.119 --> 00:33.325
- Excuse me?
- Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

00:38.281 --> 00:41.259
Lower Wacker is much more
popular this time of year.

00:41.284 --> 00:43.803
We'll check it out
tonight after our shift.

00:46.670 --> 00:48.188
Okay.

00:53.362 --> 00:55.396
- Paté, sweet breads.
- You ordered a paté platter

00:55.421 --> 00:56.969
- and sweet breads?
- Yeah.

00:56.994 --> 00:58.826
Pathologists love organ meats.

00:59.251 --> 01:01.162
You recognize that's weird, right?

01:01.340 --> 01:03.056
I think it's a vitamin D thing.

01:03.081 --> 01:04.985
We don't get much sunshine.

01:05.010 --> 01:08.234
Have a good day.

01:08.594 --> 01:10.765
- Hey, what's up?
- Morning.

01:10.790 --> 01:12.563
Big moving in party tonight?

01:12.588 --> 01:14.332
Evite wouldn't lie.

01:14.356 --> 01:16.011
Yeah, well, we'll be there.

01:16.484 --> 01:18.996
So how's it been so
far, living together?

01:19.288 --> 01:21.996
Only a couple days, but so far so good.

01:22.021 --> 01:23.341
I bet.

01:23.366 --> 01:25.956
I heard there's a giant
Whole Foods across the street.

01:25.981 --> 01:27.028
That's awesome.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.388
Yeah, it is.

01:29.702 --> 01:30.802
Good.

01:30.827 --> 01:32.596
Well, I'm really happy for you guys.

01:34.017 --> 01:35.994
Doctor Manning.

01:36.019 --> 01:38.227
- Treatment 6.
- Got it.

01:39.438 --> 01:41.723
You and Dr. Shore
better be the real deal.

01:41.748 --> 01:44.513
I am bringing a ChÃ¢teau Pichon 2005.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.029
Great, wine spritzers.

01:46.054 --> 01:48.818
Don't you dare. Treatment 1.

01:49.676 --> 01:52.028
Hey, did you get
those lab results yet?

01:52.053 --> 01:53.555
They just came in.

01:54.922 --> 01:56.540
Want me to come with you?

01:57.120 --> 01:59.580
Um, I think I better do this myself.

01:59.605 --> 02:02.183
Okay, just tell her if she
needs anything I'm here.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.598
Don't come too close.

02:17.202 --> 02:19.311
My TB's become active.

02:20.245 --> 02:23.830
The spot on your lung's a
half a centimeter larger.

02:23.854 --> 02:25.856
I'm sorry.

02:26.028 --> 02:28.385
I took my meds.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.832
I didn't overexert.
I-I just don't get it.

02:30.856 --> 02:33.973
Thing is, um, that's not all.

02:33.998 --> 02:35.405
- What do you mean?
- This...

02:35.430 --> 02:37.029
- Here, just... just read it.
- Come on, Noah.

02:37.054 --> 02:39.284
Just...  Just read it.

02:44.270 --> 02:46.029
Wait...

02:48.747 --> 02:50.573
I'm pregnant?

02:55.531 --> 02:57.530
I'm pregnant.

03:05.298 --> 03:07.448
Is it just me, or these Santas seem

03:07.472 --> 03:09.342
- to come out earlier every year?
- Right?

03:09.367 --> 03:10.707
The psych nurse station

03:10.732 --> 03:13.468
still has their
Halloween decorations up?

03:14.878 --> 03:16.629
Any Thanksgiving plans?

03:16.654 --> 03:18.971
Taking Robin out for some sushi.

03:18.995 --> 03:21.524
Good, so the two of you are
spending some time together?

03:21.549 --> 03:23.049
Yeah.

03:23.099 --> 03:25.066
Here and there. Yeah.

03:25.278 --> 03:27.755
Doing great, you know?
I mean, such a great kid.

03:27.830 --> 03:29.130
But you know how it is.

03:29.155 --> 03:30.491
You don't really worry about them.

03:30.516 --> 03:33.356
You worry about the people
they surround themselves with.

03:33.565 --> 03:35.212
Sounds like someone in particular.

03:35.237 --> 03:37.236
No, not really.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.179
I guess there's this one guy.

03:40.204 --> 03:43.612
You know, a great... great fella.
I mean, we work together.

03:43.637 --> 03:45.284
Terrific surgeon.

03:45.373 --> 03:47.788
But he's got these family issues, man.

03:47.813 --> 03:49.300
Big family issues,

03:49.325 --> 03:51.684
and obviously with
Robin's family history,

03:51.709 --> 03:53.098
it just can all

03:53.745 --> 03:55.668
turn into a bit of a powder keg.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.169
Have you spoken to her about this?

03:58.499 --> 04:00.681
No.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.152
So you're just keeping
it all to yourself?

04:03.598 --> 04:05.352
Didn't I just tell my shrink?

04:05.377 --> 04:07.041
Daniel.

04:08.898 --> 04:09.950
I don't know.

04:09.966 --> 04:11.604
I might have said something to they guy.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.286
Nothing intrusive. Just, I don't know.

04:14.311 --> 04:16.286
- Some friendly advice.
- Advice?

04:16.358 --> 04:17.656
Yeah.

04:17.908 --> 04:19.135
Daniel.

04:19.197 --> 04:20.596
Don't make the holidays

04:20.622 --> 04:23.608
any more hard than they have to be.

04:28.454 --> 04:30.722
Hey, I know this isn't ideal,
but a couple of weeks,

04:30.747 --> 04:32.694
we should have your
TB back under control.

04:32.719 --> 04:34.990
Yeah, you'll be back in the ED

04:35.015 --> 04:36.721
throwing me shade again in no time.

04:36.746 --> 04:38.698
But how did this happen?

04:38.723 --> 04:40.194
I take birth control.

04:40.219 --> 04:42.176
My opinion, your TB meds

04:42.201 --> 04:43.913
made your birth control less effective,

04:44.024 --> 04:46.984
and then becoming pregnant
weakened your immune system

04:47.010 --> 04:48.626
to let the TB become active.

04:48.651 --> 04:49.937
God.

04:50.578 --> 04:52.826
No one could have predicted this, April.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.735
In a few months I'll be
walking down the aisle

04:55.769 --> 04:56.936
with a baby bump.

04:56.961 --> 04:59.393
Yeah, but it's all good. Right?

05:00.554 --> 05:01.873
Yeah.

05:01.898 --> 05:04.233
No, it is, but...

05:04.329 --> 05:06.330
- what about Tate?
- You know Tate.

05:06.355 --> 05:08.712
He'll love it. He's
head over heels for you.

05:08.774 --> 05:11.993
Yeah, right now, but what if I get sick?

05:12.018 --> 05:13.495
What if I can't take care of this baby?

05:13.520 --> 05:15.877
- April...
- He didn't sign up for this.

05:19.766 --> 05:21.233
It's okay.

05:21.258 --> 05:22.582
Go.

05:22.698 --> 05:25.398
I'll check on you soon, okay?

05:37.484 --> 05:40.889
Jim Vance, 38, end stage kidney failure,

05:40.914 --> 05:43.484
suffered a syncopal
episode following dialysis.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.137
- Transplant candidate?
- Too far down the list.

05:47.253 --> 05:49.370
Hi, Mr. Vance. This is Dr. Halstead.

05:49.394 --> 05:51.252
Heard you had some trouble today.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.967
Today,

05:53.041 --> 05:54.541
Tuesday,

05:54.566 --> 05:56.433
last Friday.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.368
Almost every time I get dialysis now.

05:58.393 --> 05:59.593
What happens?

05:59.678 --> 06:03.013
My chest, um, it starts
to... to flutter...

06:03.327 --> 06:05.784
I feel really weak.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.202
Um, ventricular...

06:09.385 --> 06:10.919
Ectopy.

06:11.106 --> 06:12.474
- Yeah.
- Ectopy.

06:12.499 --> 06:13.899
May be IDH.

06:14.114 --> 06:16.097
Intradialytic hypotension.

06:16.266 --> 06:17.926
In some people, dialysis can cause

06:17.951 --> 06:19.640
an extreme drop in blood pressure,

06:19.665 --> 06:22.049
which prevents enough oxygen
from reaching the heart,

06:22.074 --> 06:24.543
and over time, that
can cause dysrhythmias

06:24.568 --> 06:25.844
or even a heart attack.

06:25.869 --> 06:27.455
So tell the transplant people.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.804
Maybe they can move me up the list.

06:28.829 --> 06:30.946
Well, we can try, but I'm sorry to say,

06:30.971 --> 06:33.019
heart disease usually
moves people down the list,

06:33.044 --> 06:34.436
not up.

06:35.923 --> 06:38.755
- But I'm not even 40 yet.
- I hear you,

06:38.837 --> 06:41.444
and I promise we're gonna do
everything we can to help.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.691
Yeah.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.714
Let's get him on 15 p.o. of kayexalate

06:44.739 --> 06:46.702
and start him on esmolol
to stabilize his rhythm.

06:46.727 --> 06:49.500
Or we could do low-volume dialysis.

06:49.853 --> 06:51.076
We could.

06:51.101 --> 06:52.714
Otherwise we're just
treating the symptoms

06:52.739 --> 06:54.232
and not the actual problem.

06:54.257 --> 06:55.952
- Yeah.
- Great.

06:55.977 --> 06:58.397
- Okay.
- I'll be back in a few.

06:58.422 --> 07:01.053
We'll see you.

07:03.598 --> 07:05.342
Natalie.

07:06.101 --> 07:08.374
We don't usually disagree
in front of a patient.

07:08.399 --> 07:10.126
I had to say something.

07:10.807 --> 07:13.234
You really think low-volume
dialysis will make a difference?

07:13.259 --> 07:14.425
I mean, it seems like six of one,

07:14.450 --> 07:16.001
- half a dozen the other, no?
- I don't know.

07:16.026 --> 07:17.569
Maybe. Let's find out.

07:22.673 --> 07:25.130
Hey, you bringing Clarke tonight?

07:25.155 --> 07:26.522
Good.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.225
Pathology party. Not much to look at.

07:29.457 --> 07:30.924
So how's it going with him?

07:31.115 --> 07:33.090
Good. You know, we're just

07:33.349 --> 07:35.673
trying to let it happen.
Not trying to force anything.

07:35.698 --> 07:37.631
- Force anything?
- Like moving in together

07:37.656 --> 07:39.080
for financial reasons or convenience.

07:39.105 --> 07:41.043
No, I wish Will all the best.

07:41.068 --> 07:43.041
- I just think it's weird.
- 36-year-old male,

07:43.066 --> 07:44.573
penetrating stab wound to the abdomen.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.512
- You're going to Trauma 1.
- Got it.

07:46.537 --> 07:47.894
What happened?

07:48.787 --> 07:51.388
I got jumped in the yard. Three guys.

07:51.413 --> 07:54.598
Why would they do that?
All I do is make friends.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.838
- I need to transfer him.
- Yeah, hold up.

07:58.747 --> 08:00.534
- Okay, he's ready.
- On my count.

08:00.559 --> 08:02.206
One, two, three.

08:05.522 --> 08:08.166
Guys, I got a hole in my gut.

08:08.191 --> 08:09.902
I ain't going anywhere.

08:10.012 --> 08:11.846
Left lower quadrant looks clean.

08:11.871 --> 08:13.437
No major vessels, no bowel.

08:13.462 --> 08:14.742
I can't take it.

08:14.767 --> 08:17.953
You need to put me under,
you do what you gotta do.

08:17.978 --> 08:20.308
No, I think you got lucky on this one,
Mr. Wallace.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.037
CT abdomen, then bring him back.

08:22.062 --> 08:23.029
We can take care of this one here.

08:23.054 --> 08:24.666
- Okay.
- Okay, Doc.

08:24.691 --> 08:26.692
I trust you, but I gotta ask.

08:26.717 --> 08:27.817
After you're done,

08:27.842 --> 08:30.010
am I gonna be able to play the piano?

08:31.207 --> 08:33.690
Hey, come on. Don't
leave me hanging here.

08:34.058 --> 08:37.481
Let me guess,
you never could play it before?

08:37.595 --> 08:40.313
I like you, Doc.

08:40.408 --> 08:43.577
You can stick your fingers
in me any time you want.

08:48.144 --> 08:50.350
- How's he doing?
- He'll be fine,

08:50.375 --> 08:51.842
though with a nice-looking scar.

08:51.867 --> 08:54.238
Pretty fortunate,
considering it was three against one.

08:54.263 --> 08:56.910
That's actually not the case, Dr. Choi.

08:56.935 --> 08:59.269
Seems he stabbed himself hoping to score

08:59.294 --> 09:01.013
- a holiday from prison.
- What?

09:01.038 --> 09:02.923
I guess when you're
up against 30 to life

09:02.948 --> 09:04.514
for a double homicide,

09:04.540 --> 09:06.772
you look for little diversions.

09:09.796 --> 09:12.523
Her name is Karina
Goff. She's 16 years old

09:12.548 --> 09:14.202
with a history notable
for Williams Syndrome.

09:14.227 --> 09:16.100
Her mom found her
passed out on the couch.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.659
Williams Syndrome. You ever seen it?

09:17.684 --> 09:19.652
No, never. It's a
genetic disorder, right?

09:19.677 --> 09:21.232
It's commonly associated

09:21.257 --> 09:22.767
with cardiovascular disease,

09:22.792 --> 09:24.615
but even more striking
is their personality.

09:24.639 --> 09:26.383
They produce enormous
amounts of oxytocin,

09:26.408 --> 09:28.815
which is the hormone commonly associated

09:28.840 --> 09:31.535
with feelings of trust and
the desire to be social.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.510
They're very interesting people.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.638
- Hi, Dr. Clarke!
- Hi, Karina.

09:37.663 --> 09:39.865
Wendy, this is Dr.
Latham and Dr. Rhodes.

09:39.890 --> 09:42.386
Karina. I like your earrings.

09:42.411 --> 09:46.109
- It's a moon and the stars.
- I see that.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.671
So, how we feeling today?

09:48.818 --> 09:50.084
Tired.

09:50.109 --> 09:52.198
Still awake enough to
donate her entire allowance

09:52.223 --> 09:54.017
to UNICEF this morning.

09:54.042 --> 09:55.576
Which is what? The
third time this month?

09:55.601 --> 09:56.907
Is this the first time she's fainted?

09:56.995 --> 09:58.538
Yes.

09:58.994 --> 10:01.084
May I listen to your heart?

10:11.611 --> 10:12.993
Mid-systolic ejection murmur

10:13.018 --> 10:14.993
over the right second intercostal space.

10:15.144 --> 10:16.700
Aortic stenosis?

10:16.725 --> 10:18.109
Probably.

10:18.134 --> 10:20.013
- Let's get an echo.
- Okay.

10:20.038 --> 10:21.839
Can you make me better?

10:21.904 --> 10:24.328
I am gonna try my best.

10:24.353 --> 10:26.006
Okay, dear.

10:26.031 --> 10:28.074
Let the doctor breathe.

10:29.698 --> 10:31.386
Doctor?

10:31.411 --> 10:34.900
Let us... let us run a few tests.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.242
We'll be back with our recommendations.

10:41.312 --> 10:42.950
Great.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.473
I thought maybe Sunday we
can go to the Field Museum.

10:50.897 --> 10:53.962
- That sounds good.
- DNA Center has an exhibit

10:53.987 --> 10:55.815
on the reproductive habits of sharks

10:55.840 --> 10:58.273
that's supposed to be great.

11:02.199 --> 11:04.722
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

11:05.992 --> 11:08.962
Danny still hasn't checked
in on Facebook, has he?

11:09.781 --> 11:12.256
- No.
- He'll turn up.

11:13.749 --> 11:15.478
You don't know that.

11:15.593 --> 11:17.287
He's helpless and alone out there.

11:17.312 --> 11:19.348
And you've been out there
every day looking for him.

11:19.373 --> 11:20.873
There's nothing else you can do.

11:20.898 --> 11:22.331
I could have let him stay with me

11:22.356 --> 11:24.626
- when he asked.
- No, Reese, you couldn't have.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.916
That's not your responsibility.

11:29.813 --> 11:32.396
He found you when he
needed you in the past.

11:33.231 --> 11:34.936
He'll turn up.

11:39.826 --> 11:41.257
I said get out of here.

11:41.282 --> 11:42.882
I just wanna talk to the doctor.

11:42.907 --> 11:44.751
You better get out of my face,
man; I'm not playing.

11:44.776 --> 11:46.876
I just wanted to know if you're okay.

11:46.901 --> 11:48.630
- Do I look like I'm okay, man?
- Excuse me?

11:48.655 --> 11:50.511
Sir, is everything okay in here?

11:50.706 --> 11:52.269
Yeah.

11:52.557 --> 11:54.024
I'm Ian.

11:54.049 --> 11:55.968
Jim's brother.

11:56.312 --> 11:58.085
Some brother.

12:00.225 --> 12:02.593
Go ahead. Tell 'em.

12:02.980 --> 12:05.458
- Jim...
- Go ahead and tell 'em, man!

12:05.504 --> 12:07.129
Tell 'em.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.514
I'm a perfect match to donate my kidney.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.795
Right,

12:17.926 --> 12:20.292
and he'd rather watch me
die than give it to me.

12:29.026 --> 12:30.861
I love my brother.

12:31.444 --> 12:33.245
I'd love to give him my kidney.

12:33.279 --> 12:35.018
What's stopping you?

12:36.202 --> 12:38.466
I'm HIV-positive.

12:39.561 --> 12:43.044
But giving him a kidney would
be giving him HIV as well.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.938
I'm guessing by his reaction
that he doesn't know?

12:47.963 --> 12:49.410
Not a clue.

12:49.514 --> 12:51.715
May I ask why don't you tell him?

12:51.928 --> 12:53.889
Because Jim is...

12:54.012 --> 12:56.210
incredibly homophobic.

12:56.672 --> 12:59.266
He thinks homosexuality is

12:59.453 --> 13:01.434
disgusting,

13:01.772 --> 13:03.858
deviant behavior.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.561
Yeah, well, but right now,

13:05.586 --> 13:06.989
he thinks you're willing to let him die.

13:07.014 --> 13:08.499
Well, right now...

13:08.800 --> 13:11.506
Right now he hates me
for what I'm doing,

13:12.252 --> 13:15.061
but if I tell him this,

13:15.653 --> 13:18.024
he'll hate me for who I am.

13:18.858 --> 13:20.504
I understand.

13:21.023 --> 13:22.989
But just so you know,

13:23.364 --> 13:26.069
if you don't tell him soon,
it may be too late.

13:34.441 --> 13:36.445
Hey, hello.

13:36.470 --> 13:38.910
Hey.

13:38.935 --> 13:40.464
You better put that mask on.

13:40.489 --> 13:43.324
I-I brought you some
stuff from home, okay?

13:43.349 --> 13:45.383
- Thank you.
- All right.

13:46.215 --> 13:47.968
All right, so,

13:47.993 --> 13:49.794
how you feeling?

13:49.869 --> 13:52.575
- Sit down.
- Why?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.167
What is it?

13:57.615 --> 13:59.358
I'm pregnant.

14:00.383 --> 14:02.604
Pregnant? Are you sure?

14:02.635 --> 14:03.902
You... you're on the pill.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.094
My TB meds screwed things up.

14:06.681 --> 14:09.817
I'm sorry. I know we
didn't plan for this.

14:09.842 --> 14:12.844
I know this changes everything.

14:13.309 --> 14:14.802
Yeah.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.279
We're gonna have a baby.

14:18.954 --> 14:20.910
You can't see. Um...

14:26.993 --> 14:28.943
Okay. Now put that back on.

14:29.715 --> 14:32.208
Babe, we slept in the
same bed last night.

14:32.233 --> 14:34.160
Put it back on.

14:39.325 --> 14:41.192
It's a beautiful thing, honey.

14:41.217 --> 14:42.864
It really is.

14:51.598 --> 14:54.266
Ms. Charles,
what brings you to the ED today?

14:54.301 --> 14:55.401
Yellow fever? Plague?

14:55.435 --> 14:57.190
Just a plain old cough.

14:57.215 --> 14:59.665
Things have not been the same
since the swine flu died down.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.535
Well, don't worry.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.801
They'll be another epidemic one day.

15:01.826 --> 15:03.288
That's what I keep telling myself.

15:03.313 --> 15:04.814
You know, gotta stay positive.

15:04.839 --> 15:06.360
I never figured you for an optimist.

15:06.385 --> 15:07.632
Are you kidding me?

15:07.657 --> 15:09.351
I still root for the White Sox.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.184
- Wow.
- I do.

15:11.209 --> 15:13.319
- How do you do it?
- I would love to tell you.

15:13.344 --> 15:16.784
I don't know. Maybe over drinks tonight?

15:17.312 --> 15:19.418
That sounds great. Really.

15:20.817 --> 15:23.619
I'm just not sure your
father would approve.

15:23.828 --> 15:25.799
Wha... did he say something to you?

15:25.824 --> 15:27.464
No, not... not really.

15:27.489 --> 15:30.097
He just mentioned something in passing.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.920
I see.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.636
Ms. Goff, hi.

15:43.661 --> 15:46.321
So we got Karina's test results.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.614
The large vessel leaving her heart

15:48.639 --> 15:50.375
has become severely congested.

15:50.431 --> 15:52.725
It's making her heart
work harder and harder

15:52.750 --> 15:55.648
and... and decreasing
the amount of oxygen

15:55.673 --> 15:56.879
that it can deliver.

15:56.913 --> 15:59.245
That's why she's become
so tired and listless.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.277
God. What do we do?

16:01.302 --> 16:03.303
Well, we recommend an operation

16:03.328 --> 16:06.314
to either fix the aortic
valve or replace it.

16:06.338 --> 16:08.770
- Heart surgery?
- Yes.

16:08.929 --> 16:10.740
Hi, Dr. Rhodes!

16:10.847 --> 16:13.050
What're you guys talking about?

16:13.606 --> 16:16.355
Dr. Rhodes was just
explaining your test results.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.209
Hey, Karina,
why don't we get you back to bed?

16:18.388 --> 16:20.098
There you are.

16:20.123 --> 16:23.859
So, based on what I am seeing,

16:24.058 --> 16:25.970
I believe you need surgery.

16:27.035 --> 16:28.553
Will that make me better?

16:28.578 --> 16:30.614
Well, there are never any guarantees,

16:30.639 --> 16:32.040
but, if things go well,

16:32.065 --> 16:34.240
then, yes, it will.

16:34.943 --> 16:37.095
Good! Then I wanna do it.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.621
It's not that simple, sweetheart.

16:38.655 --> 16:40.423
We need to think about this.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.438
- Give the doctor and I a minute.
- Okay.

16:43.552 --> 16:45.236
We'll be right back.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.744
I know you think surgery
has the best odds,

16:52.769 --> 16:54.135
but I also know that Williams patients

16:54.160 --> 16:55.405
have a much higher chance

16:55.430 --> 16:56.897
of not surviving general anesthesia.

16:56.922 --> 17:00.025
I completely understand,
but the fact is,

17:00.050 --> 17:01.917
her condition is quite advanced

17:02.163 --> 17:04.503
and she did express that
she wants the surgery.

17:04.529 --> 17:05.608
She doesn't understand.

17:05.634 --> 17:06.834
She says that just to please you.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.950
Well, she may not be able to make

17:07.974 --> 17:09.582
a completely informed decision,

17:09.607 --> 17:10.884
but she does know how she feels.

17:10.909 --> 17:13.258
She's under 18. It's
my decision to make.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.983
Shouldn't we at least let her
be a part of the conversation?

17:15.008 --> 17:17.977
Dr. Rhodes,
Karina is not like your other patients.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.538
I want options.

17:20.637 --> 17:22.449
Okay.

17:22.473 --> 17:25.209
Let me talk to Dr. Latham.

17:25.244 --> 17:27.113
See if he has any ideas.

17:36.886 --> 17:38.918
What did you tell Connor?

17:39.462 --> 17:40.694
Come again?

17:40.719 --> 17:42.406
Did you tell him to stay away from me?

17:42.431 --> 17:44.798
- No.
- You said something.

17:46.091 --> 17:48.438
- I might have ind...
- Who I date

17:48.493 --> 17:49.902
is not your concern.

17:49.927 --> 17:51.782
You are absolutely right. 100%.

17:51.807 --> 17:53.679
You are unbelievable.

17:53.704 --> 17:55.206
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

17:55.231 --> 17:57.006
If I worry about you, I can't help it.

17:57.031 --> 17:58.879
Okay, well, that's gonna need to stop.

17:58.904 --> 18:00.727
Can't do it. I'm your dad.

18:00.752 --> 18:03.449
I know I haven't won any
awards in that department...

18:03.474 --> 18:05.348
This is not a referendum on you.

18:05.373 --> 18:07.352
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
I'm sorry I wasn't a father.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.549
Okay, see? That... that right there.

18:08.575 --> 18:10.482
Why does it always go back to that?

18:10.507 --> 18:12.895
Does it ever occur to
you that I have moved on?

18:12.983 --> 18:14.483
I... didn't.

18:14.508 --> 18:15.719
Not only am I past it,

18:15.744 --> 18:17.685
but I really...  I do not care.

18:17.710 --> 18:20.278
So you can feel as guilty as you want,

18:20.339 --> 18:23.007
but you being overinvolved
in my life now

18:23.032 --> 18:24.651
is not gonna cut it.

18:32.139 --> 18:33.664
Hey, Doc.

18:33.689 --> 18:35.992
We gotta stop meeting like this, right?

18:40.805 --> 18:44.293
You giving me the
silent treatment?

18:45.833 --> 18:49.636
Hey, you think I could get a TV in here?

18:50.583 --> 18:53.229
You and I could watch a little...

18:53.540 --> 18:55.730
"Family Feud."

18:56.130 --> 18:57.641
Not enough time.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.172
I'm stitching you up
and then you're leaving,

19:01.197 --> 19:03.293
which means you won't be needing those.

19:04.051 --> 19:06.679
Come on. Why you gotta be like that?

19:06.704 --> 19:08.167
Because you're not here on vacation.

19:08.191 --> 19:11.059
Hey, give me a break here. I'm injured.

19:11.084 --> 19:13.157
By your own hand, I hear.

19:13.618 --> 19:15.726
You wanna play that game?

19:17.533 --> 19:20.678
I am extremely depressed,

19:21.465 --> 19:22.987
and you know what?

19:23.372 --> 19:26.781
That makes me wanna hurt myself.

19:27.550 --> 19:29.606
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

19:29.874 --> 19:31.456
You heard me too.

19:31.611 --> 19:35.806
I am gonna hurt myself!

19:37.052 --> 19:39.758
And we all know what that means.

19:45.107 --> 19:46.627
We have no choice.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.429
I'll call Dr. Charles
for a psych consult.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.508
That's right you will.

19:58.540 --> 20:01.067
He's in v-tach. Stop the dialysis.

20:01.463 --> 20:03.875
Pulse is thready. Shortness of breath.

20:04.253 --> 20:06.523
Lost his pulse. We
gotta defibrillate now.

20:06.548 --> 20:09.168
- Bag him.
- Get me the paddles.

20:09.193 --> 20:10.746
- What's going on?
- Charge to 200.

20:10.771 --> 20:12.170
He's in cardiac arrest.

20:12.605 --> 20:14.146
Clear.

20:15.491 --> 20:16.759
Still in v-tach.

20:16.784 --> 20:18.857
Come on. Charge to 300.

20:21.311 --> 20:23.256
Sinus rhythm.

20:25.012 --> 20:26.545
Jim, can you hear me?

20:29.890 --> 20:32.016
He's stable for now.

20:33.167 --> 20:34.832
Jim?

20:34.896 --> 20:37.150
I need to talk to you.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.960
I gotta tell you something.

20:47.259 --> 20:48.759
- There she is.
- Thank you.

20:48.818 --> 20:50.153
Yeah, of course.

20:50.316 --> 20:53.584
Hey, is there somewhere
we can go talk for a minute?

20:53.609 --> 20:55.042
Did you find Danny?

20:55.655 --> 20:58.323
Um...

20:58.421 --> 20:59.854
He's...

21:00.008 --> 21:01.779
he's dead, isn't he?

21:02.347 --> 21:03.945
Yes.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.963
I'm so sorry.

21:12.156 --> 21:13.866
Hey.

21:16.197 --> 21:18.801
Hey, you did everything you could.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.355
This is Sarah Reese.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.490
Hi, are you family? A friend?

21:37.515 --> 21:39.187
No, I'm his doctor.

21:39.891 --> 21:41.483
I was his doctor.

21:52.930 --> 21:55.000
Was he beaten to death?

21:55.735 --> 21:58.079
It looks that way.

21:58.914 --> 22:00.211
We won't know for sure

22:00.236 --> 22:02.665
until we have the
results of the autopsy.

22:18.813 --> 22:20.281
Hey.

22:20.522 --> 22:22.751
Your sputum cultures just came back.

22:22.858 --> 22:25.292
It turns out you don't have regular TB.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.342
It's multi-drug resistant.

22:27.366 --> 22:28.895
Okay, so...

22:28.966 --> 22:30.607
I'm gonna have to be on

22:30.632 --> 22:32.479
three or four meds instead of one?

22:32.504 --> 22:34.178
It's not quite that simple.

22:34.463 --> 22:36.721
It's only susceptible to one drug,

22:37.075 --> 22:39.643
but it's completely susceptible,
so it'll definitely work,

22:39.677 --> 22:40.881
but...

22:41.174 --> 22:42.942
this medication

22:43.018 --> 22:45.625
can cause neural tube
defects in a growing fetus.

22:45.650 --> 22:49.006
But not always. There's just a chance.

22:50.591 --> 22:52.425
Well, there... There
must be something else.

22:52.450 --> 22:54.203
I... they couldn't
have tested everything.

22:54.228 --> 22:55.190
They have.

22:55.215 --> 22:56.907
Well, tell them to test it again.

22:56.932 --> 22:58.271
I mean, try something.

22:58.296 --> 22:59.696
There's nothing else to try.

22:59.764 --> 23:00.964
I just placed the order.

23:00.989 --> 23:02.961
The first dose should
be up in a little while.

23:05.906 --> 23:07.562
I'm sorry, April.

23:33.891 --> 23:35.458
Spoke to your patient, Mr. Wallace.

23:35.493 --> 23:37.536
Let me guess, not a suicide risk.

23:37.561 --> 23:39.881
Garden variety sociopath.
He's an opportunist.

23:40.140 --> 23:43.434
Knows all the buzz words.
Not a sincere bone in his body.

23:43.467 --> 23:44.710
Good enough for me.

23:44.735 --> 23:47.209
Let's start discharge
paperwork on Treatment 4.

23:48.012 --> 23:50.418
Chalk one up for the good guys.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.305
Hi, Mr. Vance. Your rhythm looks good.

23:55.330 --> 23:56.664
How are you feeling?

23:56.689 --> 23:58.103
Disgusted.

23:59.587 --> 24:00.846
Given your latest reaction,

24:00.871 --> 24:02.852
I'd like to try something different.

24:02.877 --> 24:05.464
A medication called midodrine
to raise your blood pressure,

24:05.489 --> 24:08.879
followed by a special course
of low-calcium dialysate.

24:09.059 --> 24:10.360
Will it work?

24:11.302 --> 24:12.738
To be honest, it's a long shot.

24:12.763 --> 24:14.025
But it's our best option.

24:14.050 --> 24:15.306
Just tell me.

24:15.870 --> 24:17.237
How long have I got?

24:17.334 --> 24:19.043
You're experiencing cardiac events

24:19.068 --> 24:20.318
with every dialysis,

24:20.343 --> 24:22.110
and you need dialysis three days a week,

24:22.135 --> 24:23.595
so realistically,

24:23.747 --> 24:25.548
it can happen at any time.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.163
We are trying everything we have.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.331
Okay.

24:34.356 --> 24:35.963
Wait.

24:37.092 --> 24:39.154
You wouldn't give me your kidney

24:39.302 --> 24:41.428
'cause of the virus, right?

24:42.608 --> 24:44.780
But what if I don't care?

24:46.757 --> 24:48.644
Would you give it to me then?

24:49.638 --> 24:53.607
- But you'll get infected.
- HIV, it's better than dying.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.611
Would you do it?

24:57.748 --> 24:59.081
Yeah.

24:59.283 --> 25:00.851
Of course.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.328
Then let's do that. I want his kidney.

25:06.353 --> 25:09.255
Mr. Vance,
you are severely immunocompromised.

25:09.447 --> 25:11.414
If you received an HIV-positive organ,

25:11.440 --> 25:13.263
if you contracted HIV in any way,

25:13.327 --> 25:15.238
it could immediately progress to AIDS,

25:15.263 --> 25:16.845
and that would most likely kill you.

25:16.870 --> 25:18.009
Do it.

25:18.610 --> 25:20.098
Let's just do it.

25:20.123 --> 25:21.390
As your doctor, I strongly...

25:21.415 --> 25:24.571
Excuse...
will you excuse us for a moment?

25:24.672 --> 25:26.243
Thank you.

25:37.289 --> 25:38.705
We should look into this.

25:38.730 --> 25:42.072
Look into what?
Purposely giving someone HIV?

25:42.097 --> 25:44.059
He knows the risks. What does he have?

25:44.084 --> 25:45.563
Days? A couple of weeks?

25:45.588 --> 25:46.995
That's the thing. We don't know.

25:47.020 --> 25:47.983
He could surprise us,

25:48.008 --> 25:49.920
and make it long enough
to get a healthy kidney.

25:49.945 --> 25:53.096
We could put him on carnitine,
try sodium modeling.

25:53.121 --> 25:54.695
That's grasping at straws.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.544
Yes, a transplant is dangerous,

25:56.569 --> 25:58.591
but if it works, it
could give him years.

25:58.616 --> 26:00.217
It's unethical and illegal.

26:00.242 --> 26:02.243
Even if you found a
surgeon willing to do it,

26:02.268 --> 26:05.112
the minute anyone found out,
our licenses would be revoked.

26:05.137 --> 26:07.095
So we get a special dispensation.

26:07.678 --> 26:10.119
That man is dying in there.

26:10.144 --> 26:11.808
The least we could do
is give him a chance.

26:12.223 --> 26:15.183
Natalie...  I'm sorry.

26:15.233 --> 26:17.810
As the attending physician,
I cannot sign off on this.

26:18.299 --> 26:19.933
Fine.

26:19.958 --> 26:22.271
Then I'll figure it out myself.

26:24.999 --> 26:26.171
I'm gonna call the OR,

26:26.196 --> 26:28.531
see if they can bump
anybody till tomorrow.

26:29.031 --> 26:30.832
Dr. Rhodes, any news?

26:30.857 --> 26:32.362
We were actually just about to see you.

26:32.387 --> 26:33.872
The final reading of the echo showed

26:33.897 --> 26:35.915
even more significant
disease than we thought.

26:35.940 --> 26:38.563
We need to consider scheduling
surgery immediately.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.612
Where's Karina?

26:40.927 --> 26:42.837
That patient in there, where did she go?

26:43.159 --> 26:44.499
I told her to stay in her room.
Where is she?

26:44.524 --> 26:45.758
We'll find out. Check the ambulance bay.

26:45.783 --> 26:48.622
- You don't know where she is?
- Ma'am, just...

26:48.647 --> 26:50.222
Karina?

26:50.247 --> 26:52.940
Karina?

26:53.191 --> 26:56.173
She's in here.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.939
Sweetie,
I need you to step away from that man.

26:59.964 --> 27:01.549
Get away from him! Out of there.

27:01.575 --> 27:03.409
- Mom, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

27:03.434 --> 27:05.935
- That man is dangerous.
- But I was just saying hi.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.743
Okay, okay, I know, sweetie.

27:07.768 --> 27:10.427
Can't take my eyes off
you for one minute.

27:33.607 --> 27:35.260
It's my fault.

27:35.285 --> 27:37.547
No, that's not true.

27:37.572 --> 27:40.267
Of course it is.

27:40.399 --> 27:42.867
I told him we could remove the chip.

27:43.044 --> 27:44.678
I encouraged him to run away.

27:44.713 --> 27:47.155
You empowered him to make decisions.

27:47.180 --> 27:48.558
That's what good doctors do.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.750
But they were the wrong decisions.

27:49.775 --> 27:51.523
It was the wrong outcome.

27:53.995 --> 27:55.999
And now he's dead.

27:57.193 --> 27:58.852
I mean, who knows.

27:59.916 --> 28:01.250
If I'd have told him to wait,

28:01.275 --> 28:03.666
maybe the police would have
come and broken up the ring

28:03.691 --> 28:05.282
and he'd be free.

28:10.842 --> 28:12.641
I was careless with his life.

28:12.666 --> 28:14.345
Dr. Reese...

28:15.304 --> 28:17.269
you're anything but careless.

28:18.070 --> 28:20.071
Sometimes the best advice, you know,

28:20.096 --> 28:22.564
it's just not enough.

28:25.754 --> 28:27.588
Dangerous thing about psychiatry,

28:27.622 --> 28:30.180
it can sometimes give
those of us who practice it

28:30.231 --> 28:32.925
the illusion of control.

28:34.494 --> 28:36.367
But the human brain,

28:36.819 --> 28:38.637
it's...

28:38.662 --> 28:41.228
it is the most complex,
mysterious object

28:41.253 --> 28:42.629
in the universe.

28:43.868 --> 28:45.869
That means that what we do,

28:45.894 --> 28:47.211
it...

28:47.602 --> 28:50.229
it just doesn't come
with any guarantees.

28:52.009 --> 28:54.478
I don't think that makes
me feel any better.

28:56.349 --> 28:57.683
I know.

28:57.899 --> 28:59.400
It never does.

29:16.297 --> 29:17.882
It must be hard.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.178
It is.

29:22.812 --> 29:26.348
She is such a bright light.

29:27.698 --> 29:29.132
A breath of fresh air.

29:29.157 --> 29:32.075
You should see how people
spark up when they see her,

29:32.175 --> 29:34.394
and how happy it makes Karina.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.498
It's like she feeds off of it.

29:41.642 --> 29:43.683
If you don't operate...

29:45.143 --> 29:47.347
I'll be taking that from her.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.071
Do the surgery.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.141
We'll get her upstairs shortly.

30:19.501 --> 30:21.778
- Dr. Halstead?
- Yeah?

30:23.340 --> 30:27.422
Um, April is refusing to
take her new medication.

30:27.447 --> 30:29.382
She won't listen to me. I...

30:29.918 --> 30:32.086
I just don't know what to do.

30:45.671 --> 30:48.191
You know I'm here to convince
you to change your mind.

30:50.035 --> 30:51.469
I'm a nurse.

30:51.494 --> 30:53.791
I stopped listening to
doctors a long time ago.

31:00.466 --> 31:02.509
I know it doesn't make sense,

31:03.491 --> 31:07.431
but there's another
life inside of me now.

31:07.948 --> 31:10.079
How can I take a medicine
that could endanger it?

31:10.104 --> 31:11.574
Hopefully it won't.

31:11.935 --> 31:13.479
Hopefully.

31:14.684 --> 31:16.885
I see a lot of hopeful
people come in here

31:16.910 --> 31:19.678
and we tell them we're
doing everything we can.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.461
If I take that medication

31:22.486 --> 31:24.553
and something happens to this baby,

31:24.578 --> 31:26.595
then I didn't do everything I could.

31:26.809 --> 31:28.610
I can't live with that.

31:29.041 --> 31:32.352
April, you've been put into
an impossible situation,

31:32.632 --> 31:34.696
and I can't tell you what to do,

31:35.682 --> 31:37.950
but if you don't take this medication,

31:38.079 --> 31:39.914
there is a very high chance

31:39.939 --> 31:42.492
both you and your baby will die.

32:03.636 --> 32:05.938
It's unbelievable.

32:05.972 --> 32:07.431
Health and Human Services won't okay

32:07.456 --> 32:08.816
that HIV kidney transplant?

32:08.841 --> 32:10.530
Won't even consider it.

32:11.699 --> 32:13.785
Our local contact at the FDA.

32:13.810 --> 32:16.090
Deals with compassionate
use and experimental drugs.

32:16.115 --> 32:18.359
Might as well try everything. Thank you.

32:18.384 --> 32:19.884
Yeah.

32:25.532 --> 32:27.498
Looks like our time together's up.

32:27.768 --> 32:29.972
Yeah, you got me, Doc.

32:30.096 --> 32:32.631
Can't put anything over on you.

32:32.836 --> 32:34.971
I sent his prescription
ahead to the prison pharmacy.

32:34.996 --> 32:35.850
Great.

32:35.875 --> 32:37.673
Yeah, you're a real tough guy?

32:37.698 --> 32:39.634
Took my best shots.

32:39.659 --> 32:41.388
Bang, bang, bang. You just deflected 'em

32:41.413 --> 32:43.918
like Captain freaking America.

32:43.943 --> 32:45.942
I'm sorry your stay
was not satisfactory.

32:45.967 --> 32:47.134
Satisfactory?

32:50.678 --> 32:52.357
What the hell?

32:52.382 --> 32:53.845
Get me a portable chest X-ray, stat.

32:53.870 --> 32:55.110
On it.

32:56.535 --> 32:59.053
Doctor's too smart for
a stupid con like me.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.082
- Lungs are clear.
- Doctor.

33:03.706 --> 33:05.307
Come on.

33:06.764 --> 33:08.738
Did he swallow anything?

33:08.763 --> 33:09.915
Not that I saw.

33:17.533 --> 33:19.513
Wait, what are those?

33:22.078 --> 33:23.905
They look like little stars.

33:23.930 --> 33:25.816
They must have lacerated his esophagus.

33:25.841 --> 33:27.712
Get him up to surgery now.

33:37.532 --> 33:39.410
Wires are in. Chest is dry.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.308
Let's close the sternum.

33:50.232 --> 33:53.134
Dr. Vorspan,
was the patient wearing any earrings?

33:53.177 --> 33:54.349
No, why?

33:54.374 --> 33:56.575
They think she gave
'em to that convict downstairs,

33:56.600 --> 33:58.408
and he swallowed them.

33:59.793 --> 34:01.711
You think you've seen everything.

34:01.736 --> 34:03.800
- We'll need wire cutters soon.
- Yes, doctor.

34:03.826 --> 34:06.241
You know they did a
study once on oxytocin.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.241
College students exposed
to high levels of it

34:08.266 --> 34:10.326
just started giving their money away.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.196
Did you see how freely she
interacted with that man?

34:13.221 --> 34:14.804
Just a total stranger?

34:15.623 --> 34:17.456
I've never been good at that.

34:18.341 --> 34:20.828
It's just a symptom of
her genetic condition.

34:20.853 --> 34:22.190
True.

34:22.446 --> 34:24.841
But maybe that's not
entirely a bad thing.

34:33.387 --> 34:35.889
Any luck getting someone
to approve the transplant?

34:36.072 --> 34:38.815
Nope. Got stonewalled by everybody.

34:42.617 --> 34:44.351
I'm sorry.

34:46.397 --> 34:47.976
Yeah.

34:55.331 --> 34:58.294
Time to go tell Jim the bad news.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.429
- I'll come with.
- No.

35:02.454 --> 35:04.165
No, I'll do it.

35:04.595 --> 35:07.173
I'm the one who got his hopes up, so...

35:07.923 --> 35:09.571
What're you gonna tell him?

35:10.403 --> 35:11.821
The truth.

35:12.394 --> 35:14.653
That the one thing he
needs most in the world

35:14.678 --> 35:16.341
is right in front of him
and he can't have it,

35:16.366 --> 35:18.506
and he doesn't even have a choice.

35:19.637 --> 35:22.123
Natalie.

35:26.647 --> 35:29.182
There's still one thing we
can do to make this legal.

35:29.207 --> 35:30.605
What're you talking about?

35:31.256 --> 35:34.461
He's already said he's willing
to deal with HIV infection.

35:34.819 --> 35:36.620
Let's give him the option.

35:37.088 --> 35:38.931
Wait, are you serious?

35:38.956 --> 35:40.413
It's his decision.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.172
We'd just be giving him a choice.

35:42.197 --> 35:44.619
You realize the implications of this?

35:44.915 --> 35:46.370
I do,

35:46.613 --> 35:50.141
but if we wanna save his life,
is there any other way?

35:54.674 --> 35:57.166
Mr. Vance, I'm afraid that

35:57.191 --> 35:59.760
as things stand, there
is no possible way

35:59.785 --> 36:01.627
you can receive your brother's kidney.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.183
Wait, so there's nothing
at all that we can do?

36:04.208 --> 36:06.178
No, not as things currently stand.

36:06.203 --> 36:08.027
Even though I know the risk?

36:08.466 --> 36:10.167
Even though I wanna do it?

36:10.192 --> 36:11.359
That's correct.

36:11.476 --> 36:13.617
It is illegal to give an infected organ

36:13.642 --> 36:15.209
to a non-infected recipient.

36:15.234 --> 36:18.801
That's the terrible irony
because if you already had HIV,

36:18.826 --> 36:21.129
the procedure would be legal.

36:22.503 --> 36:26.663
Now, obviously, we can't give you HIV.

36:26.826 --> 36:28.983
No, but...

36:29.599 --> 36:31.465
but he can.

36:37.706 --> 36:39.993
And you do have a choice.

37:05.179 --> 37:06.938
How's he doing?

37:06.963 --> 37:08.657
Gonna be off solid food for a while.

37:08.682 --> 37:09.615
Could be a lot of scarring.

37:09.640 --> 37:10.840
We should know more in a few days.

37:10.919 --> 37:13.367
I guess he got his vacation after all.

37:13.392 --> 37:14.369
Yeah.

37:14.627 --> 37:16.454
I just can't believe I let him win.

37:16.659 --> 37:17.692
Really?

37:17.717 --> 37:19.852
Does this look like a win to you?

37:20.117 --> 37:21.601
He got what he wanted.

37:21.627 --> 37:24.496
So he's a patient that
came here to be treated.

37:24.521 --> 37:26.456
That should have been your focus.

37:26.481 --> 37:28.711
Are you saying I should
have let him have his way?

37:29.179 --> 37:31.726
You know, my grandfather used to say,

37:31.751 --> 37:33.718
"Never wrestle with a pig."

37:33.743 --> 37:35.174
You both get dirty,

37:35.199 --> 37:37.862
"but the pig likes it."

37:50.408 --> 37:52.236
She's gonna be fine.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.564
Back to herself.

37:56.163 --> 37:58.786
"Audentes Fortuna iuvat."

37:59.261 --> 38:01.380
"Fortune favors the bold."

38:02.815 --> 38:04.956
Congratulations, Dr. Rhodes.

38:08.051 --> 38:10.060
Good night, Dr. Latham.

38:20.470 --> 38:22.771
Hey, Sox fan.

38:22.796 --> 38:24.580
Hey.

38:25.087 --> 38:27.290
Is it too late for those drinks?

38:28.193 --> 38:30.856
What about not upsetting my father?

38:31.705 --> 38:33.907
Why stop now?

38:35.175 --> 38:38.210
Okay.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.884
- You need anything?
- No, I'm good.

38:49.909 --> 38:51.738
- Thank you.
- All right.

38:52.264 --> 38:54.106
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:54.378 --> 38:56.083
This is a really great place.

38:56.108 --> 38:57.628
I love the breakfast nook.

38:57.652 --> 38:59.829
Yeah, thanks.

39:00.401 --> 39:03.419
Are you feeling good about today?

39:04.692 --> 39:07.261
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

39:07.286 --> 39:08.546
Good.

39:11.071 --> 39:12.872
Hey, everybody.

39:12.897 --> 39:14.898
Um, thank you so much for coming.

39:14.923 --> 39:18.404
Celebrating with the people
who know Will and me best,

39:18.471 --> 39:20.038
it means a lot,

39:20.063 --> 39:23.399
but there is something that most
of you may not know about Will.

39:23.424 --> 39:25.773
He's still got a lot
of med school debt...

39:28.022 --> 39:30.768
But he paid part of his way through it

39:30.811 --> 39:32.779
by singing at Irish weddings.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.453
What?

39:35.478 --> 39:37.049
- No, no.
- Come on, come on.

39:37.074 --> 39:39.342
Yeah, you paying half
the rent now, buddy.

39:39.367 --> 39:40.308
- Come on.
- No, seriously.

39:40.333 --> 39:41.627
These people are trying
to have a good time.

39:41.652 --> 39:43.162
- Everybody wants you to.
- Come on.

39:43.187 --> 39:45.418
- Just one song.
- Okay, Ms. Goodwin.

39:45.443 --> 39:47.762
One song. She's the boss.

39:47.787 --> 39:49.058
That's right.

39:49.083 --> 39:51.338
- Can you hold this?
- Yes.

39:51.991 --> 39:53.850
You guys think you're funny, don't you?

39:53.875 --> 39:55.276
I know we're funny.

39:56.852 --> 39:58.490
All right...
