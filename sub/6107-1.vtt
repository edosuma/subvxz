02:41.500 --> 02:45.489
There's some coyotes hopping around
across the road from that windmill.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.292
What are they doing?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.260
Hell, l don't know.

02:51.533 --> 02:54.056
Looks like they're eating
something, l guess.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.793
Wanna shoot a coyote?

02:58.433 --> 03:00.296
Hell, yes.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.930
That's a dead son of a bitch.

03:33.134 --> 03:34.599
Fuck.

03:37.933 --> 03:40.455
-When did they find him?
-Sometime this morning.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.895
He was buried on a hill
near Boracho Peak.

03:43.066 --> 03:44.965
-Who killed him?
-No fucking clue.

03:45.134 --> 03:48.396
Was he involved with drugs
or smuggling or anything like that?

03:48.566 --> 03:50.191
Melquiades Estrada?

03:51.900 --> 03:53.331
No.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.629
l gotta get a mask.

04:08.867 --> 04:12.322
Jo Edna, let Earl tend to the
hot dogs and the hamburgers.

04:12.501 --> 04:14.466
He'll bring the charcoal and ice...

04:14.634 --> 04:17.122
...and folding chairs
and the whole nine yards.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.027
Just be sure Minnie
don't have to worry...

04:19.199 --> 04:21.427
...about a place to go
to the little girls' room.

04:21.601 --> 04:25.055
And tell Shawnelle she can forget
about a car on Saturday night...

04:25.234 --> 04:26.995
...if she don't show up.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.826
l love you too, baby. Gotta go.

04:31.566 --> 04:34.828
This beauty has two bedrooms,
each one with its own bathroom.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.898
Central AC and heat throughout.

04:37.067 --> 04:40.624
All of our homes come standard
equipped with electric oven...

04:40.800 --> 04:43.062
...washer, drier and dishwasher.

04:43.767 --> 04:46.733
Your Waste King garbage
disposal is optional, of course.

04:46.900 --> 04:50.354
lt's a good option because
we charge the wholesale price on it...

04:50.534 --> 04:53.364
...with no installation fee,
and it's top of the line.

04:56.867 --> 04:59.129
We're strictly top of the line.

04:59.300 --> 05:03.562
Strictly top of the line
all the time. That's our motto.

05:04.601 --> 05:08.431
-How much this house cost?
-Sixty thousand dollars.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.862
But if you're really interested...

05:11.034 --> 05:14.797
...l can get you a
1 0 percent discount, l think.

05:18.867 --> 05:20.060
Where y'all from?

05:20.234 --> 05:21.723
Cincinnati.

05:22.134 --> 05:24.464
Long way from home, huh?

05:24.833 --> 05:28.766
-What line of work bring you to Texas?
-Border Patrolman.

05:31.067 --> 05:33.499
We're always
a long way from home.

05:33.668 --> 05:35.929
Yeah. All right.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.725
Well, actually, this mobile
residence has the highest...

05:39.900 --> 05:43.298
...resale value of any domestic
residence in its price range...

05:43.466 --> 05:47.194
...in the Southwest
time and time again.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.191
l don't know.

05:50.367 --> 05:54.595
Well, we also have some excellent
previously owned mobile residences...

05:54.767 --> 05:59.597
...in the lower price ranges
if that would be your requirement.

06:21.334 --> 06:23.197
Come over here, Sparky.

06:24.668 --> 06:27.031
lt's a good thing
you can do something else.

06:36.001 --> 06:38.160
l think my horse needs water.

06:38.634 --> 06:39.997
Where'd you come from?

06:42.434 --> 06:43.797
Coahuila.

06:44.101 --> 06:46.123
What are you doing in Texas?

06:48.134 --> 06:49.531
Looking for work.

06:50.234 --> 06:51.859
What kind of work?

06:58.401 --> 07:00.697
l'm just a cowboy.

07:09.567 --> 07:11.226
Hey, Perkins.

07:12.467 --> 07:15.127
Here's the stuff that your
friend had on him.

07:17.834 --> 07:20.527
-You know who they are?
-That's his wife and kids.

07:20.700 --> 07:24.030
-Any idea how to get ahold of them?
-Well, they live in...

07:26.100 --> 07:27.566
...Mexico.

07:31.601 --> 07:33.999
Can l keep this?

07:34.434 --> 07:38.127
Yeah, l guess for a while. We're
gonna have to do an autopsy on him.

07:38.301 --> 07:41.892
When you get through,
l want you to give Melquiades to me.

07:42.068 --> 07:44.397
-Hell, l can't do that. Are you crazy?
-No.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.930
l'm not.

07:57.934 --> 07:59.524
Gotta go.

08:05.201 --> 08:08.361
-All right, see you tonight.
-Come back early, though.

08:08.534 --> 08:10.523
l get real bored here.

08:10.701 --> 08:13.167
Haven't you made
friends with the neighbors?

08:14.901 --> 08:16.924
No, l don't like them.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.926
l'm gonna buy you Nintendo
so you don't get so bored.

08:23.368 --> 08:24.390
Okay.

08:24.568 --> 08:27.590
And take me to the mall
this Saturday in Odessa.

08:28.268 --> 08:30.631
Okay, babe. Find out where it is.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.924
The deceased died of a gunshot
wound of an AR-1 5 .223 bullet.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.533
Entered 2 inches left of the sternum
between the fourth and fifth rib.

08:42.701 --> 08:44.167
lmpact caused a lung to burst.

08:44.335 --> 08:46.926
Severe hemorrhaging.
Took 1 5, 20 minutes to die.

08:47.101 --> 08:49.226
l would estimate
he died seven days ago.

08:49.401 --> 08:53.333
The trajectory indicates that the shot
was fired from 300 yards away.

08:53.502 --> 08:54.728
He was gunned down.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.961
Listen, bud, we need
to bury him now.

08:58.135 --> 09:02.362
Refrigeration in this dump is broke,
and l gotta be in El Paso tomorrow.

09:02.534 --> 09:05.932
-Okay, bury him.
-l need to notify his relatives.

09:07.668 --> 09:09.327
He ain't got any.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.824
<i>Two-one-seven, clear.</i>

09:22.801 --> 09:24.824
<i>Three-five-nine, clear.</i>

09:37.435 --> 09:38.526
<i>This is 7 49.</i>

09:38.702 --> 09:42.498
<i>I have approximately 1 5 individuals
crossing La Brecha de la Loma Negra.</i>

09:42.668 --> 09:45.692
<i>About a half a mile from me. Over.</i>

10:07.968 --> 10:09.332
Where are they?

10:09.902 --> 10:12.060
Right down there in that draw.

10:17.634 --> 10:19.123
On the ground!

10:22.835 --> 10:24.391
Get down!

10:24.567 --> 10:25.931
<i>Alto, goddamn it!</i>

10:34.035 --> 10:35.864
Run, run, Mariana!

10:40.335 --> 10:41.392
Take her.

11:22.101 --> 11:24.091
Stay down, bitch!

11:33.568 --> 11:35.295
Stay down.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.095
-How many got away?
-Three.

11:45.268 --> 11:47.825
Well, somebody's gotta
pick strawberries.

11:49.602 --> 11:52.159
You were way overboard there, boy.

11:53.069 --> 11:55.330
No, sir.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.791
Fuck it. They were
trying to get away.

11:58.535 --> 12:02.592
Think about how much trouble l'll get
into if you keep beating these people.

12:02.769 --> 12:04.462
l don't like trouble, boy.

12:04.835 --> 12:06.767
l don't like it at all.

12:40.902 --> 12:42.834
l'm awful sorry about Mel.

12:43.935 --> 12:45.423
So am l.

12:46.468 --> 12:48.764
He's a good Mexican.

12:52.669 --> 12:56.567
Pete, you been cooped up
in here for two days.

12:57.101 --> 13:00.659
You need to get outside
and do something.

13:01.336 --> 13:02.892
What's that to you?

13:13.136 --> 13:15.068
Brought you some jerky.

13:19.569 --> 13:21.397
l found these shells...

13:21.568 --> 13:25.262
...out there where Mel's
goats was on the loose.

13:25.436 --> 13:28.799
They was about
300 yards up the hill.

13:28.969 --> 13:31.560
They might mean something.

14:20.669 --> 14:21.966
You ladies fine?

14:28.336 --> 14:30.495
How's your eggs, sweetie?

14:57.069 --> 14:58.728
Bob's watching us.

15:01.102 --> 15:04.091
lt's been a while since
we've had some time together.

15:05.869 --> 15:07.426
You dirty bitch.

15:07.802 --> 15:09.428
l could see you tomorrow.

15:15.069 --> 15:17.661
-Miss.
-Just a second.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.298
Same place?

15:22.935 --> 15:24.595
Same place.

15:34.003 --> 15:35.695
What's it gonna be?

15:41.602 --> 15:44.694
-What do you want?
-l wanna talk to you.

15:49.169 --> 15:53.033
We found that stuff where
we found Melquiades' goats.

15:56.970 --> 15:59.492
Don't you wanna look at it?

16:00.036 --> 16:02.935
No, l don't. l wanna sit here
and have my breakfast.

16:03.302 --> 16:06.927
-Talk to me during business hours.
-lt might be some kind of proof.

16:07.102 --> 16:10.659
Hey, how many .223 shells
you think are laying out there?

16:10.970 --> 16:14.424
Hell, some of them gonna
have your fingerprints on them.

16:14.603 --> 16:18.865
That shit won't mean shit in court just
because you found it under a bush.

16:19.869 --> 16:22.529
l got a legal system
to think about here.

16:32.102 --> 16:35.228
You goddamn son of a bitch!

16:38.503 --> 16:41.469
<i>Bass seek cover from whatever
the local environment offers.</i>

16:41.636 --> 16:42.828
<i>Submerged rock....</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:45.901
<i>You've been late for dinner
the last four nights.</i>

16:46.069 --> 16:52.491
<i>Work. Work is hard.
Real hard. I work hard.</i>

16:52.836 --> 16:55.802
<i>And I'm tired. I'm so tired.</i>

<i>Please, understand.

Stuffed zucchini and broccoli.

17:03.037 --> 17:05.832
-That's it?
-l'm on a diet.

17:07.869 --> 17:11.165
<i>Someone else paying the bills?
Putting a roof over your head?</i>

17:11.336 --> 17:14.063
<i>Johnny, I know there's
someone else. I know it.</i>

17:14.236 --> 17:16.794
<i>-That's ridiculous.
-You're not fat.</i>

17:16.970 --> 17:20.492
<i>-It's that girl from the office. Sheila?
-Yes, l am. A little bit.</i>

17:20.670 --> 17:23.135
<i>-No way.

17:23.301 --> 17:26.030
<i>-You're my red-hot mama.
-She's pretty.</i>

17:26.203 --> 17:29.499
<i>She's prettier than me. She's free
and happy and has red hair.</i>

17:29.670 --> 17:32.295
<i>-Stop it.
-I'm not stupid, Johnny. I've got eyes.</i>

17:32.469 --> 17:36.060
<i>She'll wreck your life and mine
and hers. That's what will happen.</i>

17:36.236 --> 17:38.669
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

17:38.836 --> 17:43.269
<i>You're throwing your life away,
Johnny. Don't do it. Please don't do it.</i>

17:44.102 --> 17:47.967
<i>I need you. I love you. Please.</i>

17:48.670 --> 17:51.898
<i>You see, right there. That's
exactly what I'm talking about.</i>

17:52.070 --> 17:55.161
<i>It's always the same.
Always the same.</i>

17:55.670 --> 17:57.499
<i>Oh, Johnny.</i>

17:58.136 --> 18:00.466
<i>What's happening to us?</i>

<i>Don't you remember when
we were living in River Valley?</i>

18:10.370 --> 18:12.096
<i>Yes, doll.</i>

18:12.270 --> 18:15.031
<i>I remember River Valley.
We were happy then.</i>

18:15.903 --> 18:17.459
<i>And we'll be happy again.</i>

18:17.636 --> 18:19.102
<i>I know it.</i>

<i>Please, don't cry.</i>

18:22.503 --> 18:25.492
<i>There will always be
a River Valley for us.</i>

18:25.670 --> 18:27.500
<i>I hope so, Johnny.</i>

18:28.003 --> 18:29.663
<i>I hope so.</i>

18:55.703 --> 18:57.168
Thanks.

18:59.369 --> 19:02.665
You're getting to be a regular
customer around here.

19:03.836 --> 19:06.064
Well, l don't have
a lot to do right now.

19:43.537 --> 19:45.935

-How many calves left?
-1 20.

20:01.437 --> 20:02.902
That's a shitload.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.800
When's the boss
coming from Houston?

20:04.970 --> 20:06.436
Saturday afternoon.

20:06.603 --> 20:08.070
Fucking mama's boy.

20:08.370 --> 20:10.801
He says he's a rancher just because
they bought him this ranch...

20:10.970 --> 20:12.766
...but l ain't seen him out here
busting his ass.

20:12.936 --> 20:15.266
You're in a twist because
the only woman you've had...

20:15.437 --> 20:17.562
...for a while is your own hand.

20:22.337 --> 20:24.633
Let's go to Midland this Saturday.

20:25.070 --> 20:27.798
The Border Patrol will nab me
in Midland.

20:27.970 --> 20:31.766
Bullshit.
You scared of women, or what?

20:32.637 --> 20:35.694
Agustin, shut the goddamn gate!

20:39.370 --> 20:40.563
Don't worry.

20:40.737 --> 20:43.669
This happens to Bob
sometimes too.

20:45.138 --> 20:47.535
Well, it goddamn well
don't happen to me.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.567
lt's the first fucking time
it's ever happened to me.

20:50.737 --> 20:52.861
l don't give a shit
what happens to Bob.

20:53.038 --> 20:54.866
Yeah, l know.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.093
Viagra works for Bob.

21:00.704 --> 21:04.761
l'll turn truck-stop queer and
blowjob-giver before l use that shit.

21:07.437 --> 21:09.596
That's what Bob says.

21:13.604 --> 21:15.070
Fuck Bob.

21:30.437 --> 21:33.495
<i>Hey, man, you still listen to that
pinche white-boy candy rapper?</i>

21:33.671 --> 21:37.535
Reese's Pieces, Skittles, Eminem.
Gotta stop listening to that.

21:37.704 --> 21:41.192
Kumbia Kings. That's who you
need to listen to, man.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.368
-What's your favorite rifle round?
-What?

21:47.537 --> 21:50.003
What rifle do you shoot?
Always the same round?

21:50.171 --> 21:52.330
AR-1 5, .223 standard. Why?

21:52.504 --> 21:56.062
l was just curious.
l always use the .30-30 myself.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.800
Lever action.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.063
Open sight.

22:10.237 --> 22:14.364
-Don't know what you're missing.
-Eminem. That's all he listens to.

24:13.971 --> 24:15.597
Hello.

24:40.471 --> 24:42.800
Shit. Fuck.

24:46.605 --> 24:48.230
Fuck.

25:44.371 --> 25:46.394
How do we register him?

25:47.438 --> 25:48.801
Write down ''Melquiades.''

25:51.705 --> 25:53.864
Melquiades what?

25:54.238 --> 25:55.897
Where's he from?

25:56.538 --> 25:59.528
Mexico. Maybe Coahuila.

26:14.805 --> 26:18.033
Cincinnati"s real pretty
in the springtime.

26:19.305 --> 26:23.600
-There's lots of malls.
-l bet you miss it.

26:25.305 --> 26:27.430
We're glad to be here.

26:28.805 --> 26:30.668
You know, wherever
the job takes us.

26:30.838 --> 26:32.463
But this is different.

26:33.538 --> 26:35.094
Yeah.

26:37.271 --> 26:41.136
We were both
real popular in high school.

26:42.838 --> 26:45.599
Now it just seems like we
don't know anybody anymore.

26:45.772 --> 26:49.296
Well, living out here takes
some getting used to, l guess.

26:49.472 --> 26:51.733
Yeah. l guess it does.

26:51.905 --> 26:54.803
lt must seem real different.

26:59.838 --> 27:02.633
Do you know where, like,
the mall's at in Odessa?

27:02.805 --> 27:05.669
Sure. lt's easy to find.

27:42.005 --> 27:43.561
Hey, man.

27:44.972 --> 27:46.404
You okay?

27:47.072 --> 27:48.436
No.

27:56.238 --> 27:58.102
This working hours?

27:59.538 --> 28:01.300
Well, we're about to close.

28:01.472 --> 28:05.564
You need to investigate them
Border Patrols that use the .223.

28:05.938 --> 28:09.393
Want me to investigate the Kennedy
assassination while l'm at it?

28:09.572 --> 28:13.129
Before you bitch, find out
what that fucker was involved with.

28:13.471 --> 28:15.630
Melquiades wasn't
involved with nothing.

28:21.538 --> 28:23.731
By the way, we already buried him.

28:24.705 --> 28:26.638
l told you to notify me.

28:26.805 --> 28:29.397
lt seemed like you'd at least...

28:31.372 --> 28:33.201
...notify me.

28:35.605 --> 28:38.470
You're not his family.
l don't have to notify you.

28:38.638 --> 28:40.537
He was a wetback.

29:09.339 --> 29:12.634
-You like him?
-lt's the best horse l ever saw.

29:12.806 --> 29:15.533
Take him, he's yours.

29:17.239 --> 29:19.967
Really, take him.

29:20.139 --> 29:21.832
But it's your horse.

29:22.006 --> 29:26.404
Mine, yours....
What's the difference?

29:26.706 --> 29:30.967
He's got ''Pete'' branded in his brain.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.863
No, he cost you a lot.

29:38.372 --> 29:42.395
Shit, don't even get off of him.

30:58.972 --> 31:01.734
Hey, Bob, how long
we been married?

31:03.539 --> 31:05.096
Twelve.

31:10.606 --> 31:12.901
Hell, l don't know.

31:15.639 --> 31:16.900
What day is it?

31:43.040 --> 31:44.630
Relax.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.563
But the Border Patrol is everywhere.

31:46.739 --> 31:49.728
-lt's fine, man, don't worry.
-Where are you going?

31:49.906 --> 31:51.997
Where do you think? To get the girls.

31:54.839 --> 31:56.771
Hurry up.

32:43.507 --> 32:45.268
Could l see some photo lD, sir?

32:50.607 --> 32:52.936
Girls, this is Melquiades.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.097
-Lou Ann.
-Oh, Lou Ann.

32:57.006 --> 33:00.870
-Nice to meet you.
-You work with Pete, right?

33:04.473 --> 33:06.904
-That's the one from the cafe, right?
-Yes, genius.

33:07.073 --> 33:08.664
-But she's married.
-So's the other one.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.169

Wanna dance?

36:18.306 --> 36:20.671
-You're not coming?
-No, l'll wait here.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.704
-You've always liked the mall.
-l'll wait.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.929
But l don't wanna hurry,

37:47.174 --> 37:50.163
<i>And we are not loca. No way.</i>

38:40.141 --> 38:41.903
-Shit, what time is it?

38:42.075 --> 38:44.200
Fuck. Bob's gonna kill me.

38:45.174 --> 38:47.640

38:47.808 --> 38:50.501
-Sheriff's turn?
-Stop it. You know how things are.

38:50.675 --> 38:53.505
-All right, no problem.
-Hey, don't mix things up.

38:53.675 --> 38:55.868
You're the one l love,
darling, only one.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.633
-Belmont's something else.
-What about old Bob?

38:59.041 --> 39:00.871
That's different.
Bob's my husband.

39:01.041 --> 39:02.439
You understand, right?

39:16.641 --> 39:18.697
-Bye, Pete.
-Bye.

39:20.408 --> 39:21.930
Let's go.

41:22.075 --> 41:23.735
Hey, man.

41:25.042 --> 41:26.769
You okay?

41:29.341 --> 41:31.069
<i>You bueno?</i>

<i>You bueno?</i>

41:59.308 --> 42:01.500

-Just fine.

42:01.675 --> 42:03.539
-Morning.
-Morning.

42:03.975 --> 42:07.135
l need to talk to you about
that dead Mexican y'all found.

42:07.308 --> 42:08.637
What about it?

42:09.208 --> 42:12.264
-l'd rather talk outside.
-All right.

42:21.941 --> 42:24.930
lt's our new officer, Mike Norton.

42:25.109 --> 42:27.700
Yeah. Little prick.

42:29.809 --> 42:32.899
Apparently, he was out there
on the Boracho Peak, okay?

42:33.075 --> 42:35.166
Shots were fired.

42:35.342 --> 42:36.831
And he returned.

42:37.008 --> 42:38.941
There was only
two of them out there.

42:39.109 --> 42:43.006
Mike Norton, new kid from Cincinnati,
and that wetback.

42:43.175 --> 42:45.107
Shots were fired?
Who fired at who?

42:45.275 --> 42:47.434
He fired at him first.

42:47.609 --> 42:49.802
Now, l don't want any shit.

43:20.075 --> 43:22.940
-What are you doing here?
-l need to talk to you.

43:24.975 --> 43:26.601
What about?

43:27.042 --> 43:30.066
-Belmont came by the café today.
-So what?

43:30.708 --> 43:33.231
Border Patrol by the name
of Gomez came looking.

43:33.409 --> 43:34.636
So what?

43:35.976 --> 43:38.805
Gomez told him who killed
that Mexican.

43:46.409 --> 43:48.307
Don't fool with me, girl.

43:48.475 --> 43:50.270
Hell, no.

43:50.742 --> 43:53.731
He told Belmont a Border Patrol
killed him in a shootout.

43:53.908 --> 43:56.397
-Did he say his name?
-Yeah.

43:56.575 --> 43:58.939
A guy named Mike Norton.

43:59.909 --> 44:03.705
-You heard him say that?
-Said his name, like, three times.

44:03.876 --> 44:07.172
-What are they gonna do with him?
-They didn't say.

44:27.909 --> 44:30.965
-What's wrong with you? Goddamn!
-Arrest him.

44:31.143 --> 44:34.041
-Who do you think you are?
-That fellow who killed Melquiades.

44:34.208 --> 44:37.232
-Who would that be?
-That Border Patrolman, Mike Norton.

44:37.409 --> 44:40.807
-With what evidence?
-You know damn well who killed Mel.

44:40.976 --> 44:42.942
l don't know a goddamn thing.

44:43.109 --> 44:45.597
You know damn well
who killed Melquiades.

44:46.343 --> 44:48.605
You ain't gonna arrest him, are you?

44:48.776 --> 44:52.538
You better get out of here
before l throw your ass in jail.

44:56.842 --> 44:58.603
You ain't gonna arrest him.

46:29.410 --> 46:30.637
Who is it?

46:30.809 --> 46:34.741
l'm here for Patrolman Norton.
Captain Gomez sent me.

46:34.910 --> 46:36.637
Yeah, just a sec.

46:43.909 --> 46:45.807
You scream again, l'll kill you.

46:49.575 --> 46:51.542
Put your hands over your head.

46:54.777 --> 46:56.003
You got any handcuffs?

46:56.176 --> 47:00.541
-Yeah. ln my uniform belt.
-Get them handcuffs in that uniform.

47:00.710 --> 47:02.835
Bring them back in here
and keep quiet.

47:03.343 --> 47:05.502
Do what he says, Lou Ann.

47:12.243 --> 47:15.970
Put that uniform on
and then them handcuffs.

47:25.642 --> 47:27.268
You tell her what you did?

47:31.910 --> 47:33.136
What did he do?

47:36.009 --> 47:38.840
He killed Melquiades Estrada.

47:58.043 --> 48:00.032
You need to try to relax.

48:10.410 --> 48:12.501
Might get cold.

48:13.376 --> 48:15.205
There we go.

48:16.376 --> 48:20.570
Now, if you call the police,
l'm gonna have to kill him, darling.

48:27.942 --> 48:30.204
<i>There's rain coming now
through Cincinnati.</i>

48:30.376 --> 48:33.638
<i>We could be looking at heavy rain
through the day on Friday...</i>

48:33.809 --> 48:37.264
<i>...so flash flooding will be a huge
concern in the tri-state area.</i>

49:05.076 --> 49:06.702
Get out.

49:09.476 --> 49:11.238
You gonna kill me?

49:15.443 --> 49:16.932
Get out.

49:38.177 --> 49:39.665
Dig him up.

49:41.810 --> 49:43.504
-Who?
-Melquiades Estrada...

49:43.677 --> 49:48.803
...you stupid, gringo, son of a bitch.
You killed him, now dig him up.

49:51.343 --> 49:53.139
<i>Today's storm that swept Ohio...</i>

49:53.310 --> 49:56.070
<i>...sent dozens of vehicles
sliding on the roadways...</i>

49:56.244 --> 49:59.005
<i>...forced hundreds of stores
and businesses to close.</i>

49:59.177 --> 50:02.506
<i>Good news here is no one
was seriously injured.</i>

50:21.576 --> 50:23.304
Get him out.

51:20.410 --> 51:21.934
Get out.

51:31.477 --> 51:33.375
Get around here.

51:39.277 --> 51:41.243
Take him in the house.

51:48.411 --> 51:50.569
Sit him on that bed.

52:00.078 --> 52:01.906
Turn that light on.

52:07.177 --> 52:08.734
Sit down at this table.

52:09.377 --> 52:11.366
ln that chair.

52:15.577 --> 52:18.065
Melquiades lived here.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.935
That was his bed.

52:22.078 --> 52:24.339
Kept his clothes right over there.

52:30.910 --> 52:32.433
That was his plate.

52:34.511 --> 52:36.703
And that was his cup.

52:45.678 --> 52:47.166
Drink it.

52:51.511 --> 52:52.772
No.

52:58.444 --> 53:00.535
Drink from that cup.

53:20.244 --> 53:22.733
These was his work clothes.

53:25.744 --> 53:28.108
Put them work clothes on.

53:28.278 --> 53:31.266
Then put them dress clothes
on Melquiades.

53:49.978 --> 53:53.411
The oldest is Elizabeth.
She must be fourteen.

53:53.678 --> 53:56.337
And Yesenia is probably twelve.

53:56.511 --> 54:00.342
And this little guy is Aaron.

54:00.611 --> 54:03.009
He's going to be a damn good cowboy.

54:03.178 --> 54:06.905
And this is Evelia.

54:08.210 --> 54:10.870
Evelia Camargo, my wife.

54:12.744 --> 54:15.040
How long since you've seen them?

54:18.577 --> 54:20.271
About five years.

54:25.844 --> 54:27.833
Promise me one thing, Pete.

54:29.211 --> 54:30.972
lf l die over here...

54:32.411 --> 54:34.400
...carry me back to my family...

54:35.644 --> 54:37.667
...and bury me in my hometown.

54:39.344 --> 54:43.141
l don't want to be buried on this side
among all the fucking billboards.

54:43.311 --> 54:46.038
l'll die before you will, l'm older.

54:46.211 --> 54:47.836
Promise me.

54:53.911 --> 54:55.207
We're here, right?

54:55.377 --> 54:59.241
Go down to Ojinaga
and head south.

54:59.678 --> 55:03.667
Then turn east and follow the sierra
until you come to Coahuila.

55:03.844 --> 55:06.674
Then you'll come to a town
called El Toston.

55:07.512 --> 55:10.671
Between El Toston
and El Nacimiento...

55:10.845 --> 55:13.606
...there's a little place
named Jimenez.

55:13.911 --> 55:15.274
lt's my home.

55:15.444 --> 55:18.774
Ask for Evelia, my wife,
and explain things to her.

55:19.178 --> 55:20.439
l'll just throw you in the trash.

55:20.611 --> 55:22.669
You take me back to Jimenez, Pete.

55:24.178 --> 55:25.940
You promised.

55:39.511 --> 55:41.068
Come here.

55:47.311 --> 55:49.504
Sit down in that chair.

55:54.245 --> 55:55.608
l'll take them boots.

55:58.078 --> 56:00.067
Oh, shit!

56:03.644 --> 56:04.871
All right.

56:05.412 --> 56:06.742
Let's go.

56:06.911 --> 56:08.275
Oh, fuck.

56:11.512 --> 56:13.205
You fucker.

56:44.745 --> 56:46.904
What did he leave
that uniform there for?

56:47.079 --> 56:48.567
Tell us he's crazy.

56:55.545 --> 56:57.976
What time did we find
this guy's wife?

56:58.478 --> 57:00.842
About 9:00 this morning.

57:05.512 --> 57:08.705
Goddamn crazy son of a bitch,
Pete Perkins.

57:09.545 --> 57:10.772
What do you think?

57:17.046 --> 57:19.841
l think the son of a bitch is crazy.

57:32.645 --> 57:35.702
Right now they should be
somewhere here headed for Mexico.

57:35.879 --> 57:38.276
What about that
heat-seeking radar y'all got?

57:38.445 --> 57:40.604
-lt don't work.
-They found four steers...

57:40.779 --> 57:44.871
...in a canyon on the Cross Bar
diamond this morning at about 3:00.

57:45.046 --> 57:47.637
-What about rangers?
-Told them we had it covered.

57:47.812 --> 57:49.641
Be over by today.
Know what l mean?

57:49.812 --> 57:52.505
There's 1 000 ways he can go.
That son of a bitch...

57:52.679 --> 57:55.076
...is so fucking nuts
he might head to Canada.

57:55.246 --> 57:57.108
We'll start with the Llano Largo...

57:57.278 --> 58:00.244
...the Sierra Diablo
and the Arroyo Negro.

58:00.412 --> 58:01.900
Where y'all going?

58:02.079 --> 58:04.670
The rest of the
United States, l reckon.

58:05.445 --> 58:07.002
Due what?

58:08.745 --> 58:11.405
We'll head southeast
over to Alarid Canyon.

58:32.446 --> 58:34.843
Where are we going?

58:37.246 --> 58:39.803
There's nowhere to go, man!

58:44.979 --> 58:47.241
We're not going up there, are we?

58:47.812 --> 58:49.608
Shit.

59:56.445 --> 59:58.843
Well, hell.

01:00:11.746 --> 01:00:13.371
This is Frank Belmont.

01:00:13.545 --> 01:00:15.136
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.638
l'm at work.

01:00:18.312 --> 01:00:20.210
<i>Am I gonna see you today?</i>

01:00:22.513 --> 01:00:25.104
Yeah, all right.

01:00:25.279 --> 01:00:27.268
<i>Same time, same place?</i>

01:00:29.745 --> 01:00:33.404
<i>-Yeah, l guess.
-Good.</i>

01:00:33.579 --> 01:00:36.601
<i>Stop at the store
and pick up a pack of Kotex.</i>

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.639
Shit!

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.771
Shit, shit, shit!

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.078
What am l doing here?

01:02:43.213 --> 01:02:45.610
Well, it's our duty, sir.

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.110
Shut up.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.078
Where are you going?

01:03:17.546 --> 01:03:19.876
He stinks, man. l can't sleep.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.740
Get back over there
where you was at.

01:04:00.681 --> 01:04:02.169
Hey.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.070
Hey, you.

01:04:06.647 --> 01:04:08.475
My name's Pete.

01:04:11.713 --> 01:04:13.373
Well, Pete...

01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:16.474
...the ants are eating your friend.

01:04:21.413 --> 01:04:23.175
Fucker.

01:04:28.147 --> 01:04:30.010
Goddamn!

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:19.744
All right.

01:05:59.213 --> 01:06:01.441
Get down and don't try nothing.

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:20.874
Who's there?

01:06:36.147 --> 01:06:38.908
l don't speak Spanish.
What do you want?

01:06:39.781 --> 01:06:42.269
We're friends. Wanted some
water for our horses.

01:06:44.048 --> 01:06:45.842
Well, help yourself, then.

01:06:46.013 --> 01:06:48.980
l like listening to this
Mexican radio station.

01:06:49.147 --> 01:06:51.340
l can't understand anything...

01:06:51.514 --> 01:06:54.946
...but l like the way
Spanish sounds, don't you?

01:06:55.847 --> 01:06:57.369
Yes, sir.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.673
Sounds all right.

01:06:59.846 --> 01:07:02.039
Smells like something
dead around here.

01:07:02.213 --> 01:07:05.338
l killed a deer a couple days ago.
lt's starting to turn.

01:07:06.914 --> 01:07:10.038
Yeah? Well, you better
throw it away. lt's rotten.

01:07:10.213 --> 01:07:14.078
l wanna keep the hide. You got
any salt l could use to cure it?

01:07:14.248 --> 01:07:18.010
No, son. l barely got enough salt
to put on the dinner table.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.737
You got any alcohol
or anything like that?

01:07:20.914 --> 01:07:23.346
l got a jug of antifreeze.

01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:25.243
Would that work?

01:07:41.781 --> 01:07:44.179
Suck on this hose.

01:08:11.814 --> 01:08:14.473
Them ants won't eat
him anymore after this.

01:08:15.781 --> 01:08:17.303
You're crazy.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.469
You're totally fucking crazy, man.

01:08:21.647 --> 01:08:23.908
Y'all come and eat!

01:08:59.081 --> 01:09:01.171
Let us pray.

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:15.305
Dear Lord...

01:09:15.481 --> 01:09:17.242
...we thank you for this meal...

01:09:17.413 --> 01:09:20.540
...and for bringing me these friends
and our daily bread...

01:09:20.714 --> 01:09:23.680
...and all the animals
and all the beast in the field.

01:09:23.846 --> 01:09:25.506
Amen.

01:09:36.913 --> 01:09:38.778
You live alone?

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:44.004
l've got a son that comes and sees me
every month and brings me food.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.578
But it's been six months
since he was here.

01:09:50.415 --> 01:09:51.778
What do you live on?

01:09:54.281 --> 01:09:56.440
l got some things stored away.

01:10:07.947 --> 01:10:09.345
Thank you.

01:10:09.514 --> 01:10:12.640
-l'd like to ask you a favor.
-Anything you want.

01:10:13.014 --> 01:10:14.480
l wanted to ask you...

01:10:16.415 --> 01:10:18.381
...if you can shoot me.

01:10:22.682 --> 01:10:25.273
My son ain't coming back.

01:10:28.981 --> 01:10:30.970
Oh, he'll come back.

01:10:31.148 --> 01:10:34.410
No, he told me he had cancer.

01:10:35.615 --> 01:10:38.672
And he told me to
go back to town with him.

01:10:40.781 --> 01:10:44.111
But l don't wanna go,
because l've always lived here.

01:10:44.715 --> 01:10:46.544
Well, we can't do it.

01:10:46.715 --> 01:10:50.874
l don't wanna offend God
by killing myself.

01:10:51.048 --> 01:10:53.071
lt's a problem.

01:10:55.881 --> 01:10:58.348
We don't wanna offend God either.

01:10:58.914 --> 01:11:01.278
lt would be the best thing to do.

01:11:06.248 --> 01:11:08.339
You're good people.

01:11:11.481 --> 01:11:13.414
You need to go ahead
and shoot me.

01:11:14.915 --> 01:11:18.574
You know, l'm innocent actually.

01:11:19.348 --> 01:11:22.008
l didn't mean
to kill your friend, man.

01:11:23.515 --> 01:11:26.141
He shot at me, all right?

01:11:27.682 --> 01:11:30.443
And l swear to God,
really, if l could....

01:11:36.516 --> 01:11:38.845
You let me go and l promise--

01:11:39.381 --> 01:11:40.937
l swear.

01:11:41.115 --> 01:11:43.637
l promise l will not press charges.

01:11:45.581 --> 01:11:47.274
Where's that son of a bitch at?

01:11:47.448 --> 01:11:48.778
l don't know.

01:11:48.947 --> 01:11:51.607
You ought to,
you've been fucking him.

01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:58.239
We don't talk a lot.

01:12:25.481 --> 01:12:26.913
God almighty.

01:12:28.748 --> 01:12:30.907
Get this horse off of me.

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:33.537
Get up, Bill, get up.

01:12:33.715 --> 01:12:35.443
Come on.

01:12:36.281 --> 01:12:38.145
Come on, come on, come on. Up.

01:12:44.815 --> 01:12:47.281
Goddamn, Bill, get up.

01:12:48.648 --> 01:12:49.875
Whoa, Bill.

01:15:47.749 --> 01:15:50.647
Fucking motherfuck!

01:17:19.283 --> 01:17:20.771
Shit!

01:17:30.683 --> 01:17:32.649
Help!

01:17:32.817 --> 01:17:34.305
Help!

01:17:36.582 --> 01:17:38.275
Help!

01:18:11.582 --> 01:18:13.606
-Good afternoon, sir.
-How do you do?

01:18:13.783 --> 01:18:16.578
Sir, have you seen anyone
coming through this area...

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:18.874
...or in this general area
on horseback?

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:21.608
Like, maybe two men? Horseback?

01:18:21.783 --> 01:18:24.613
Maybe with a couple
pack horses or mules?

01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:27.147
l ain't seen anybody in 30 years.

01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:30.582
All right. l am sorry, sir.

01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:35.239
Have you heard anyone come this way
in the past few days or hours?

01:18:35.417 --> 01:18:36.848
Are y'all cops?

01:18:37.016 --> 01:18:39.481
No, sir, we're actually
with the Border Patrol.

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:41.905
Ain't no Mexicans
come through here.

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:44.844
We're not looking for Mexicans.

01:18:47.816 --> 01:18:50.112
-No one come through.
-Are you sure?

01:18:50.283 --> 01:18:52.715
Hell, no, l'm not sure.

01:18:52.884 --> 01:18:54.179
But l don't think so.

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:56.838
Okay. Do you need anything?

01:18:59.617 --> 01:19:01.139
No.

01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:04.439
All right, we're moving out.

01:19:22.283 --> 01:19:24.340
This way, hurry up!

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:31.914
Watch out.
That's a rattlesnake.

01:19:32.084 --> 01:19:34.209
He's not gonna bite anybody.

01:19:34.883 --> 01:19:36.713
A dead guy!

01:20:09.916 --> 01:20:11.405
He's still breathing.

01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:14.343
-l think that snake bit him.
-He sure did.

01:20:14.517 --> 01:20:17.677
-ls he a gringo?
-He looks too fucked up to be a gringo.

01:20:17.849 --> 01:20:19.247
Has he got money?

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:23.472
l think it's too late.

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:29.345
Take it easy. l'm a friend.

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:33.543
-We didn't do nothing, mister.
-l know it.

01:20:33.717 --> 01:20:36.444
-What happened to him?
-He was bite by a snake.

01:20:37.183 --> 01:20:38.706
He's dying.

01:20:38.883 --> 01:20:41.179
You know where
we can get some help?

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:46.339
l know a girl who is good with herbs.
Maybe she can cure him.

01:20:46.517 --> 01:20:48.347
But she lives across the border.

01:20:48.517 --> 01:20:50.449
ls it far?

01:20:50.617 --> 01:20:52.310
The border is not far.

01:20:52.483 --> 01:20:54.847
<i>But la Migra is all around.</i>

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:59.040
<i>They are looking for a gringo
who kidnap a Migra agent.</i>

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:02.976
You're the gringo.

01:21:07.617 --> 01:21:08.810
Yes.

01:21:12.884 --> 01:21:15.906
Can you help me get him across?
l don't want him to die.

01:21:18.284 --> 01:21:22.579
Tomas, keep going with them.
l'll take the gringo to get cured.

01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:42.116
l'm leaving.

01:21:43.084 --> 01:21:44.311
You're leaving.

01:21:45.051 --> 01:21:46.482
Yes.

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:49.610
l hate this place.

01:21:50.316 --> 01:21:52.283
Maybe he'll come back.

01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:54.075
l don't care.

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:56.275
He'll come back, honey.

01:21:56.684 --> 01:21:58.377
l don't care.

01:22:00.017 --> 01:22:02.483
The son of a bitch
is beyond redemption.

01:22:17.084 --> 01:22:18.743
l'm leaving him.

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:28.614
-Can you get us across?
-Yes.

01:22:28.784 --> 01:22:32.114
But l've never crossed people
from this side to that side.

01:22:33.051 --> 01:22:36.040
-Much less on horses.
-Okay, take us.

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.115
-What about the price?
-What price?

01:22:38.284 --> 01:22:40.147
The price to cross you.

01:22:40.316 --> 01:22:42.340
lt's 1 000 a person.

01:22:43.617 --> 01:22:46.015
l don't have $ 1 000.

01:22:46.184 --> 01:22:49.479
Three-thousand dollars.
A thousand for you.

01:22:49.651 --> 01:22:52.673
And 1 000 for the gringo.
And 1 000 for the dead guy.

01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:54.339
Shit.

01:22:55.484 --> 01:22:57.574
l'll find a way to get across.

01:22:59.950 --> 01:23:02.678
Okay, let's make a deal.

01:23:02.850 --> 01:23:04.440
Give me your rifle...

01:23:04.617 --> 01:23:06.606
...and your horse.

01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:09.443
No.

01:23:22.817 --> 01:23:25.682
All right, l'll give you the horse.
But not my horse.

01:23:25.851 --> 01:23:27.908
-The other horse.
-And the rifle.

01:23:28.351 --> 01:23:29.578
Just the horse.

01:23:31.518 --> 01:23:33.313
Okay, done deal.

01:23:36.518 --> 01:23:37.949
Okay.

01:23:50.184 --> 01:23:52.082
This is where we cross.

01:23:52.251 --> 01:23:55.274
-ls the water deep?
-A little.

01:24:02.418 --> 01:24:05.747
No! No, goddamn it! No!

01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:12.009
Fucking gringo bit me.
Sonofabitch.

01:24:12.184 --> 01:24:13.548

01:24:13.718 --> 01:24:15.707
Fuck you, sons of bitches!

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.407
What the hell is this on me?

01:24:17.584 --> 01:24:19.516
You sons of bitches!

01:24:19.684 --> 01:24:20.945

Fuck you!

01:24:29.252 --> 01:24:31.114
Fuck you!

01:24:45.084 --> 01:24:46.607
Fuck!

01:25:19.484 --> 01:25:22.678
-Dona Adriana, is Mariana at home?
-Yes, she is.

01:25:25.885 --> 01:25:27.612
What's going on?

01:25:31.985 --> 01:25:34.247
ls this the one that got snakebit?

01:25:38.518 --> 01:25:40.882
Get this gringo out of here.
He's the one that broke my nose.

01:25:41.052 --> 01:25:42.143
You sure?

01:25:42.318 --> 01:25:44.283
Hell yes,
he's got a face like a white rat.

01:25:44.452 --> 01:25:46.212
-He'll probably die.
-Let him die.

01:25:46.985 --> 01:25:48.712
Please...

01:25:52.485 --> 01:25:54.575
...heal him.

01:25:54.818 --> 01:25:56.579
Why?

01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:58.840
Because...

01:25:59.685 --> 01:26:02.083
...l need him alive.

01:27:24.785 --> 01:27:26.445
Will he get well?

01:27:31.285 --> 01:27:32.614
From the poison, yes.

01:27:32.785 --> 01:27:37.547
But if he gets gangrene,
we'll have to cut his foot off.

01:29:35.673 --> 01:29:37.662
Your call is ready.

01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:56.127

01:29:56.306 --> 01:29:58.000

<i>I'm in Mexico.</i>

You know the Border Patrol

01:30:08.739 --> 01:30:10.830
What's Belmont doing?

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:14.271
He went on vacation. He said he
had nothing to do with this.

01:30:14.439 --> 01:30:18.497
Said it's between you and the Border
Patrol, and he wanna go to SeaWorld.

01:30:23.639 --> 01:30:25.628

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:48.066
Because l love Bob, Pete.

01:30:49.873 --> 01:30:53.168
You said l was the only you loved.

01:30:55.873 --> 01:30:59.703
Pete, you don't understand.
l have to go. Take care.

01:32:46.006 --> 01:32:50.166
We'll get you home pretty soon,
Melquiades.

01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:53.401
Any day now.

01:32:59.906 --> 01:33:02.338
You look like hell, son.

01:33:44.307 --> 01:33:46.068
Good morning.

01:33:50.473 --> 01:33:51.734
Where am l?

01:33:55.373 --> 01:33:57.839
Mexico. Shit.

01:33:58.941 --> 01:34:03.270
-Who are you, man?
-Your private 91 1 , dude.

01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:06.570
The gringo asshole woke up.

01:34:09.141 --> 01:34:10.833
She's gonna check you up.

01:34:12.973 --> 01:34:15.633
Easy. Easy.

01:34:17.473 --> 01:34:19.303
Drink.

01:34:19.507 --> 01:34:21.939
-ls there hot coffee?
-Fresh made.

01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:23.766
Bring me the pot.

01:34:34.674 --> 01:34:37.401
Now we're even, asshole.

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.300
You want to help us?

01:36:24.341 --> 01:36:26.364
We'll have to walk it from here.

01:36:31.607 --> 01:36:33.267
Shit.

01:36:42.007 --> 01:36:43.337
Come here.

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:31.103
You try to run away again, l'll kill you.
l guess you know that by now.

01:37:31.274 --> 01:37:32.263
Yes, sir.

01:37:44.974 --> 01:37:46.940
<i>Do you even know how much
new tires cost?</i>

01:37:47.107 --> 01:37:50.437
<i>Do you even know what the mileage
on your little foreign car is?</i>

01:37:50.607 --> 01:37:54.096
<i>Do you know when the oil change
is due? Tell me. I want you to tell me.</i>

01:37:54.275 --> 01:37:56.968
<i>Johnny, is there someone else?</i>

01:37:57.141 --> 01:37:59.471
<i>What do you mean?
Someone else what?</i>

01:37:59.641 --> 01:38:01.868
<i>Someone else putting
a roof over your head?</i>

01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:03.905
<i>-Someone paying the bills--?
-Johnny.</i>

01:38:04.074 --> 01:38:07.370
<i>You've been so distant,
so far away. I cook. I clean house.</i>

01:38:07.541 --> 01:38:09.734
<i>I wonder what your mother
would say. I do.</i>

01:38:09.908 --> 01:38:11.669
<i>My mother has no say.</i>

01:38:11.841 --> 01:38:15.295
<i>Do you think she cares about me?
You think she cares about you?</i>

01:38:19.042 --> 01:38:20.439
<i>No, it's not.</i>

01:38:20.608 --> 01:38:23.073
<i>She is addicted to vodka
and Valium, and she is....</i>

01:38:23.242 --> 01:38:26.435
-You want some coffee?
-Yes, sir. Please.

01:38:30.474 --> 01:38:34.066
<i>No, she is not. She is not.</i>

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:35.468
<i>Oh, yes, I do care.</i>

01:38:38.974 --> 01:38:40.406
Sit down.

01:38:41.908 --> 01:38:45.431
<i>I gave up a scholarship
to State University to take this job--</i>

01:38:45.608 --> 01:38:47.267
Can you sell us some food?

01:38:47.441 --> 01:38:49.702
l'll give it to you.

01:38:50.441 --> 01:38:52.271
We have fresh meat.

01:38:53.575 --> 01:38:55.541
Take what you want.

01:38:58.108 --> 01:39:00.096
We had to kill him.

01:39:00.309 --> 01:39:03.138
This fucking bear was killing
too many goats.

01:39:04.308 --> 01:39:06.332
<i>No, it's not.
It's that girl from the....</i>

01:39:06.575 --> 01:39:10.268
-ls this Coahuila?
-Yes, you're right here in Coahuila.

01:39:11.374 --> 01:39:14.431
Do you know how to get to El Toston?

01:39:16.542 --> 01:39:18.598
Twenty kilometers that way.

01:39:19.142 --> 01:39:21.664
<i>I'm not stupid, Johnny.
I've got eyes in my head.</i>

01:39:21.841 --> 01:39:25.603
When you hit the sierra,
head south and you'll get there.

01:39:27.675 --> 01:39:29.834
<i>You're throwing your life away,
Johnny.</i>

01:39:30.007 --> 01:39:31.871
<i>Don't do it. Please don't do it.</i>

01:39:32.042 --> 01:39:35.133
l've seen that. l know this one.

01:39:35.309 --> 01:39:37.968
<i>Please. Please. Please.</i>

01:39:38.141 --> 01:39:40.801
<i>You see, that's it.
That's exactly it, right there.</i>

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:44.771
<i>That's what I'm talking about. It's
always the same, always the same.</i>

01:39:45.775 --> 01:39:47.708
<i>Johnny.</i>

01:39:47.875 --> 01:39:49.205
What'd the guy on TV say?

01:39:49.374 --> 01:39:51.136
<i>We used to be so happy.</i>

01:39:51.309 --> 01:39:53.400
Let's go.

01:39:58.108 --> 01:39:59.472
Take it...

01:39:59.641 --> 01:40:01.039
...for your troubles.

01:40:01.775 --> 01:40:03.604
<i>We were happy then.</i>

01:40:03.775 --> 01:40:05.435
<i>And we'll be happy again.</i>

01:40:05.608 --> 01:40:06.972
<i>I know it.</i>

01:40:07.141 --> 01:40:10.233
<i>Please, don't cry.</i>

01:40:10.408 --> 01:40:14.273
<i>There will always be
a River Valley for us.</i>

01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:17.366
<i>I hope so, Johnny.</i>

01:40:17.541 --> 01:40:19.769
<i>I hope so.</i>

01:41:15.742 --> 01:41:18.469
-Yes, it's $2.
-You speak English.

01:41:18.641 --> 01:41:21.665
Yeah, everyone here speak English.

01:41:21.841 --> 01:41:24.103
We were worked on the other side.

01:41:24.275 --> 01:41:27.968
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for a town called Jiménez.

01:41:28.142 --> 01:41:30.074
Jiménez?

01:41:31.042 --> 01:41:34.372
No, there's no place like that here.

01:41:34.708 --> 01:41:37.435
Do you know of a place
called Jimenez?

01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:42.767
Manuel...

01:41:43.075 --> 01:41:45.769
...you ever hear of Jimenez?

01:41:46.275 --> 01:41:47.935
Jiménez?

01:41:48.409 --> 01:41:51.034
No, not around here.

01:41:55.076 --> 01:42:00.007
They said it was a little village
about 1 0 kilometers away.

01:42:03.975 --> 01:42:09.169
No, the only village around
here is called Los Chilicotes.

01:42:09.342 --> 01:42:11.807
Do you know this woman?

01:42:11.975 --> 01:42:14.840
Her name is Evelia Camargo.

01:42:15.809 --> 01:42:18.037
Yeah, l know her.

01:42:19.275 --> 01:42:22.070
But her name's not Evelia.

01:42:22.242 --> 01:42:23.503
lt's Rosa.

01:42:25.375 --> 01:42:26.602
Do you know that man?

01:42:28.042 --> 01:42:31.769
He's the one lived in Jiménez.
His name is Melquiades Estrada.

01:42:32.875 --> 01:42:34.637
No, we don't him.

01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:39.731
What's he doing with that woman?

01:42:41.742 --> 01:42:43.537
l don't know.

01:42:46.109 --> 01:42:48.166
Why you don't ask her?

01:42:49.642 --> 01:42:51.335
She lives around the corner.

01:43:06.142 --> 01:43:07.369
You speak English?

01:43:13.209 --> 01:43:16.142
Well, señora...

01:43:16.908 --> 01:43:21.341
...Melquiades was a good friend.
l'm sorry to tell you he's passed away.

01:43:22.442 --> 01:43:25.374
Who is Melquiades?

01:43:26.475 --> 01:43:28.304
Melquiades, your husband.

01:43:28.943 --> 01:43:31.534
He's passed away and l've brought
his body back from Texas.

01:43:31.709 --> 01:43:34.766
l don't know anyone
named Melquiades.

01:43:37.509 --> 01:43:41.374
Well, this is you and that's him.

01:43:43.209 --> 01:43:45.108
What are you doing
with a photo of me and my kids?

01:43:45.275 --> 01:43:47.139
Melquiades gave it to me.

01:43:49.543 --> 01:43:53.270
Please, señora,
you can tell me the truth.

01:43:53.442 --> 01:43:55.465
He was a good friend of mine.

01:43:55.642 --> 01:43:57.267
You were married to him,
weren't you?

01:43:57.442 --> 01:43:59.635
Don't talk foolishness.

01:43:59.809 --> 01:44:02.798
Because you'll get me in trouble
with my husband, Javier Martinez...

01:44:02.976 --> 01:44:04.499
...and we don't know any Melquiades.

01:44:07.342 --> 01:44:10.275
Excuse me, ma'am.
l didn't want to offend you.

01:44:11.075 --> 01:44:13.167
But Melquiades was my friend.

01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:17.734
Go see Don Casimiro.

01:44:18.742 --> 01:44:21.174
He knows everybody
that comes through town.

01:44:21.777 --> 01:44:23.503
Maybe he can help you.

01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:30.472
No.

01:44:32.075 --> 01:44:33.302
l don't know him.

01:44:37.243 --> 01:44:40.208
You know anything about
a little town called Jiménez?

01:44:40.376 --> 01:44:42.001
No.

01:44:42.677 --> 01:44:45.370
lt doesn't exist around here.

01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:53.766
l know for sure.

01:44:55.376 --> 01:44:57.035
lt doesn't exist.

01:44:57.710 --> 01:44:58.970
Why?

01:45:11.475 --> 01:45:12.772
Your friend lied to you.

01:45:12.943 --> 01:45:15.773
-No, he didn't.
-Sure he did.

01:45:24.076 --> 01:45:25.702
There's no Jiménez, man.

01:45:25.876 --> 01:45:27.637
Wake up.

01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:04.041
-That place doesn't exist.
-Yes, it does.

01:46:08.243 --> 01:46:12.641
There is no fucking Jiménez, man!

01:46:14.842 --> 01:46:17.331
Don't you see? There's no Jiménez!

01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:19.339
lt exists.

01:46:20.010 --> 01:46:22.635
Jimenez is a beautiful fucking place.

01:46:23.842 --> 01:46:26.172
lt sits between two hills.

01:46:27.977 --> 01:46:30.340
The air is so clear there...

01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:33.704
...you feel like you can hug
the mountains with your arms.

01:46:35.076 --> 01:46:39.338
A stream of clear clean fresh water
bubbles up right out of the rocks there.

01:46:40.843 --> 01:46:42.705
lf you go to Jimenez...

01:46:44.009 --> 01:46:48.465
...l swear to you your heart will break
with so much beauty.

01:47:30.643 --> 01:47:32.973
This is Jimenez.

01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:42.337
lt's just like Mel said it was.

01:47:46.210 --> 01:47:48.267
Got good water.

01:47:52.411 --> 01:47:53.933
And...

01:47:55.376 --> 01:47:57.399
...that's the house.

01:48:01.243 --> 01:48:03.505
Store's right over yonder.

01:48:10.044 --> 01:48:11.270
Graveyard.

01:48:21.610 --> 01:48:23.076
Garden.

01:48:23.243 --> 01:48:24.971
Right there.

01:48:26.144 --> 01:48:27.575
See?

01:48:30.477 --> 01:48:32.840
Just like that right there.

01:48:34.244 --> 01:48:35.903
See?

01:48:39.276 --> 01:48:40.503
Yeah.

01:48:43.009 --> 01:48:44.600
This is it.

01:48:46.810 --> 01:48:48.867
You found it, Pete.

01:48:51.677 --> 01:48:53.075
Well...

01:48:54.743 --> 01:48:56.709
...get down.

01:50:37.443 --> 01:50:40.036
You got a grave to dig.

01:51:58.677 --> 01:52:00.610
Ask Melquiades for forgiveness.

01:52:00.777 --> 01:52:03.505
-What?
-Ask for forgiveness.

01:52:05.211 --> 01:52:08.904
Ask for forgiveness right now
or go to hell right now.

01:52:09.611 --> 01:52:11.372
l don't believe in hell.

01:52:21.011 --> 01:52:22.476
l'm sorry!

01:52:23.045 --> 01:52:25.567
l swear to God, l'm sorry.

01:52:40.744 --> 01:52:43.642
l swear to God. l swear to God.

01:52:43.811 --> 01:52:47.208
l did not mean to kill him.

01:52:48.578 --> 01:52:51.271
lt was a mistake.

01:53:03.478 --> 01:53:05.602
l didn't want it to happen.

01:53:16.044 --> 01:53:20.171
lt hurts me, and l regret it...

01:53:20.344 --> 01:53:22.833
...every single day.

01:53:24.744 --> 01:53:26.677
Forgive me.

01:53:27.078 --> 01:53:29.101
Forgive me...

01:53:29.644 --> 01:53:31.270
...Melquiades...

01:53:35.544 --> 01:53:37.703
...for taking your life. Forgive me.

01:53:37.878 --> 01:53:41.072
Forgive me.

01:53:41.244 --> 01:53:43.836
Forgive me.

01:54:40.212 --> 01:54:42.201
You can go now.

01:54:55.411 --> 01:54:56.672
Where?

01:54:58.545 --> 01:55:00.306
To your wife.

01:55:02.278 --> 01:55:03.607
Wherever.

01:55:16.579 --> 01:55:18.544
l always. . . .

01:55:20.844 --> 01:55:23.709
l always thought that
you'd end up killing me.

01:55:26.678 --> 01:55:28.735
You can keep the horse...

01:55:29.512 --> 01:55:30.875
...son.

01:56:26.478 --> 01:56:29.000
You gonna be all right?
