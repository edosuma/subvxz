00:35.390 --> 00:36.450
Nice decorations.

00:36.490 --> 00:37.920
I think you missed
a spot.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.190
I can still see a piece
of your lawn.

00:40.220 --> 00:41.660
Well I like your
decorations too.

00:41.690 --> 00:43.860
In case you hadn't noticed
it is Christmas time.

00:43.930 --> 00:45.790
How can you not notice
on this street?

00:45.860 --> 00:47.860
Me, I like to do
my own thing.

00:47.900 --> 00:48.600
Which is...?

00:48.630 --> 00:49.660
Hmm.

00:49.730 --> 00:50.970
Nothing I guess.

00:51.030 --> 00:51.770
Huh.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.300
Have a good day.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.690
Okay April, one
more decoration

01:14.720 --> 01:17.160
and you will officially
be over the top.

01:17.190 --> 01:20.400
Umm, there can never be
too many decorations.

01:24.970 --> 01:26.970
Awwwww!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.240
Oh my God!

01:28.270 --> 01:29.770
You still have these?

01:29.810 --> 01:31.470
Yeah forever!

01:31.840 --> 01:34.240
Do you remember why Mom
and Dad gave me these?

01:34.280 --> 01:35.440
Yes I do.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.380
It was so that you could
get your picture taken

01:37.410 --> 01:39.580
with Santa Claus even though
you were too old

01:39.620 --> 01:41.520
to sit on his lap
at the mall.

01:41.550 --> 01:42.980
You cried all the
way home.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.190
No, I'm sorry.

01:44.220 --> 01:46.520
You can never be too old
to sit on Santa's lap.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.590
Oh Elaine, here.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.520
Take a picture for me
to send to mom.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.930
Okay.

01:50.960 --> 01:51.930
Okay.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.560
She will love it.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.160
Okay, one,
two, three.

01:57.270 --> 01:58.200
Love that.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.500
Where is that
coming from?

02:00.540 --> 02:01.540
Two doors down.

02:01.570 --> 02:02.870
It's my new neighbor.

02:02.910 --> 02:04.810
From what I can
tell he's a real...

02:04.840 --> 02:06.770
Yeah, If it's not him
and his buddies,

02:06.810 --> 02:08.280
it's him and his
sports car.

02:08.310 --> 02:09.509
Oh.

02:09.550 --> 02:11.950
It's a shame you can't
choose your neighbors.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.650
No...And he's the only one
on this entire block

02:15.690 --> 02:17.690
who won't put decorations
in his front yard.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.320
Like not even
a little bit.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.590
Really?

02:20.620 --> 02:20.990
Nothing?

02:21.020 --> 02:21.820
Nothing!

02:21.860 --> 02:23.190
Like not even
one thing!

02:26.030 --> 02:29.660
So...How about that glass of
wine you promised me?

02:29.730 --> 02:30.800
That I can do.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.800
Mom's gonna be really happy
to hear you have a boyfriend.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.800
<i> What?!</i>

02:35.840 --> 02:37.340
He looks really cute
in this picture.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.010
I love you.

02:42.150 --> 02:43.510
<i>Oh they're</i>
<i> going deep!</i>

02:47.120 --> 02:48.180
Here it is!

02:48.220 --> 02:49.320
Come on!

02:49.350 --> 02:50.120
What?!

02:50.150 --> 02:51.120
Throw the fly!

02:51.150 --> 02:53.350
<i> That's terrible.</i>

02:53.390 --> 02:55.560
Pass me one of the slices
that have pepperoni.

02:55.630 --> 02:57.030
Hey Ted, how
are the kids?

02:57.090 --> 02:57.530
Doing well.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.730
Doing well.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.930
Speaking of...Anyone know
where you can find one

03:00.000 --> 03:01.400
of those talking Furry
Murray toys?

03:01.460 --> 03:02.460
Yeah forget it man.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.070
Those are the hottest
toy this year!

03:04.100 --> 03:06.170
I know, my kid wants
one for Christmas.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.340
We can't find them
anywhere.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.540
My wife found
one online.

03:08.610 --> 03:09.770
But you don't
wanna know

03:09.810 --> 03:11.710
how much we paid for
that thing, man.

03:11.740 --> 03:13.680
I think you're already
paying for it, buddy.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.110
Really?

03:14.140 --> 03:14.910
Seriously.

03:14.950 --> 03:16.180
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

03:16.210 --> 03:17.680
You do not know what
you're missing, my friend.

03:17.710 --> 03:20.080
When you see the smiles on their
faces on Christmas morning,

03:20.120 --> 03:21.280
it makes it
worth it.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.980
Says the guy wearing
a Santa hat.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.820
Get this thing off.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.960
It's not like I
don't like kids.

03:27.020 --> 03:28.220
I'm crazy about
my sister's.

03:28.260 --> 03:29.920
Then why'd you buy
this big house?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.190
More wall space for
my book jackets.

03:32.860 --> 03:35.130
So, Uncle Eric, what are
you doing for Christmas?

03:35.170 --> 03:36.260
Going skiing again?

03:36.300 --> 03:37.300
Not this year.

03:37.330 --> 03:39.200
Bridget's not much for
outdoor sports.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.040
Wait a minute...who's
Bridget?

03:41.100 --> 03:42.000
His latest girlfriend.

03:42.070 --> 03:42.500
Whoa.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.270
Whoa.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.340
Pump the brakes.

03:44.370 --> 03:45.540
She's not technically
a girlfriend.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.410
We've only been going
out for a few months.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.580
Plus, I gotta stick around
and finish my book.

03:49.610 --> 03:51.050
Deadline's the end
of the month.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.210
How's it going?

03:52.280 --> 03:54.120
Meh...You know...

03:54.150 --> 03:55.850
Another best-seller
I take it?

03:56.520 --> 03:57.790
Who wants
another beer?

03:59.660 --> 04:00.860
Got anymore of that
guacamole?

04:00.890 --> 04:02.060
<i> Yeah, that was</i>
<i> good stuff.</i>

04:02.090 --> 04:03.020
<i> Where'd you get it?</i>

04:03.060 --> 04:04.090
I made it.

04:04.130 --> 04:05.690
It's one of the recipes
from my book.

04:05.730 --> 04:06.760
<i> Oh yeah, that's right.</i>

04:06.830 --> 04:08.230
You didn't read
it, did you?

04:08.300 --> 04:10.430
You're going to make someone
a great wife someday.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.000
The game's back on.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.540
So, there is something that
I want to talk to you about.

04:17.570 --> 04:19.410
Did Steve propose?!

04:19.640 --> 04:20.510
No.

04:21.779 --> 04:23.540
If he had we'd be drinking
champagne right now.

04:25.350 --> 04:27.120
Well, tell me,
what is it?

04:27.150 --> 04:29.050
What do you
wanna tell me?

04:29.090 --> 04:30.950
Okay, it's about
the orchestra.

04:30.990 --> 04:34.290
So Ivan Samuels is retiring
at the end of the season,

04:34.360 --> 04:37.330
and they're starting
auditions soon.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.700
And...?

04:41.130 --> 04:42.300
Why are you
telling me?

04:42.330 --> 04:44.100
Because I think you
should audition.

04:48.440 --> 04:48.900
Wait, no.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.040
Are you serious?

04:51.070 --> 04:52.570
No!

04:52.640 --> 04:56.780
No,no,no,no,no...You know what
happens to me when I audition.

04:57.050 --> 04:59.310
So you get
the hiccups.

04:59.350 --> 05:01.280
I bet you they wouldn't
even notice.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.150
Do you remember the ninth
grade recital auditions?

05:08.730 --> 05:09.620
Oh, yeah.

05:12.360 --> 05:15.330
Oh I mean there's gotta be
a way to get over that.

05:16.030 --> 05:16.660
No.

05:16.730 --> 05:17.300
I have tried everything.

05:17.330 --> 05:18.300
Just think about it.

05:18.370 --> 05:20.470
How awesome it would
be if you got in,

05:20.500 --> 05:21.700
and we could
play together.

05:21.770 --> 05:24.040
I mean that's always
been our dream.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.210
Look, there
is a saying.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.280
"Those who can, do, and
those who can't, teach."

05:29.780 --> 05:31.310
Look, you're a good
teacher April,

05:31.350 --> 05:32.950
but you're a
great violinist.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.780
You're just afraid
to find that out.

05:34.820 --> 05:35.420
No.

05:35.450 --> 05:36.320
No.

05:36.350 --> 05:37.850
I am afraid to
audition.

05:37.890 --> 05:40.120
There is a clear
difference there.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.360
Enough about me.

05:41.390 --> 05:43.490
How are you,
and Steve?

05:43.530 --> 05:45.130
How's the restaurant?

05:45.160 --> 05:46.030
Good.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.530
It's his first Christmas since
he bought the restaurant,

05:48.570 --> 05:50.670
so he's just working
around the clock.

06:00.810 --> 06:01.640
Hey, Mom.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.780
How are you?

06:02.810 --> 06:04.410
I'm fine, but your niece and
nephew were

06:04.480 --> 06:06.910
a little disappointed you didn't
make it over here yesterday.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.320
I told you I would try and make
it by, but it turns out

06:10.350 --> 06:12.950
some of the guys came by for
the game, and well...

06:12.990 --> 06:14.090
you know.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.660
<i> How about stopping</i>
<i> by today?</i>

06:15.690 --> 06:16.520
Sorry, I can't.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.130
I got a meeting
with my agent,

06:18.160 --> 06:20.830
and then I have some writing
I need to get done.

06:20.860 --> 06:22.530
When are Dana and
Bruce coming home?

06:22.600 --> 06:23.770
Your sister and
brother in-law

06:23.800 --> 06:25.470
will be home the day
after tomorrow.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.940
I'll try to make it over
there before then.

06:27.970 --> 06:28.800
I promise.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.740
Eric, don't let
the kids down.

06:30.770 --> 06:33.780
They want to spend
time with their uncle.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.540
Don't make me feel
guilty or anything.

06:35.580 --> 06:37.680
Isn't that what mothers
do best?

06:38.080 --> 06:39.210
<i> See you soon, sweetheart.</i>

06:39.280 --> 06:39.680
Alright.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.150
Bye mom.

06:45.090 --> 06:46.120
<i>Another extension?</i>

06:46.160 --> 06:48.320
Look Eric, we've already
gotten you two.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.690
I don't think the publisher
will go for it.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.930
Why not?

06:51.960 --> 06:53.730
I'm one of their best-selling
authors, right?

06:54.230 --> 06:55.960
I'll give it a try.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.300
Just between us, what's
taking you so long?

06:58.370 --> 07:01.300
I mean, it's not like you're
writing War and Peace.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.070
What's that supposed
to mean?

07:03.110 --> 07:04.410
Oh c'mon, Eric.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.910
I've repped you
for ten years.

07:05.980 --> 07:07.740
These books are
pretty formulaic.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.740
Honestly, why are
you having such

07:09.780 --> 07:11.750
a hard time all
of a sudden?

07:11.780 --> 07:13.410
Honestly?

07:13.950 --> 07:17.320
I think I'm finally getting
tired of writing the same thing.

07:17.350 --> 07:18.850
No, that's not good.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.720
Nuh-uh.

07:40.910 --> 07:42.480
Oh, uh...Good
job sweetie.

07:42.550 --> 07:45.080
Just remember you wanna keep the
bow between the fingerboard

07:45.150 --> 07:47.350
and the bridge, It's
very important.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.450
Let's try it again.

08:21.780 --> 08:22.750
Hey!

08:23.090 --> 08:24.350
She did great today.

08:24.390 --> 08:25.090
Great!

08:25.120 --> 08:26.420
Did you have
fun, Hun?

08:26.890 --> 08:28.220
Afternoon, April.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.660
Conrad.

08:29.690 --> 08:32.630
I really must commend you on
your decorations this year.

08:32.700 --> 08:33.559
Aw.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.830
Thank you.

08:34.860 --> 08:37.330
Now if we could just get
everyone else on board.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.429
Oh.

08:38.470 --> 08:40.130
I think he's a
lost cause.

08:41.940 --> 08:44.610
I mean would it really be
that much trouble to...

09:32.290 --> 09:33.920
Afternoon, Mr. Redford.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.390
I'm glad I ran
into you.

09:37.190 --> 09:38.090
Really?

09:38.130 --> 09:39.330
Why's that?

09:39.360 --> 09:41.400
The neighbors have
generously offered

09:41.430 --> 09:42.960
to decorate your
front yard.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.930
You won't even have
to lift a finger.

09:44.970 --> 09:46.230
Thanks anyway,

09:46.270 --> 09:48.440
but I happen to like my
house just the way it is.

09:48.470 --> 09:49.670
That's why I
bought it.

09:49.740 --> 09:51.210
Maybe just a couple
of strings...

09:51.240 --> 09:52.470
No thanks.

09:52.510 --> 09:53.610
I'm good.

09:59.920 --> 10:00.680
Hey, Nick.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.250
How's the writing
coming?

10:02.290 --> 10:03.720
<i> It's not.</i>

10:03.750 --> 10:05.190
<i> Well, you better find</i>
<i> some inspiration fast,</i>

10:05.220 --> 10:08.760
because the publisher says
no more extensions.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.200
Uh...You alright?

10:25.980 --> 10:27.010
Oh just a moment.

10:27.940 --> 10:29.280
Excellent, beautiful
presentation.

10:36.650 --> 10:38.350
Oh hey, sorry I
am late, boss.

10:38.390 --> 10:39.120
Boss.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.620
I could get
used to that.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.360
Don't get used
to that.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.290
So what's up?

10:44.330 --> 10:45.490
The groom had
cold feet.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.830
I had to start The Wedding
March three times

10:47.860 --> 10:49.360
before he walked
down the aisle.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.340
Well I've got
to um...

10:56.470 --> 10:57.910
Coming.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.680
Your blind date
had to leave.

11:00.710 --> 11:01.610
What blind date?

11:01.640 --> 11:02.810
Oh, he's a friend
of Steve's.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.380
He's an ER doctor.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.380
We thought you two
might hit it off,

11:06.450 --> 11:10.080
but he got called out on
an emergency, so...

11:10.150 --> 11:12.850
Mhm...Don't you two
ever give stop?

11:13.490 --> 11:14.690
No.

11:17.060 --> 11:18.560
Looks like a full
house tonight.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.760
Minus one.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.830
Oh...Another potential
husband down the drain.

11:26.870 --> 11:29.140
Isn't this everything I
told you it would be?

11:29.170 --> 11:30.940
Yeah, it's very...

11:30.970 --> 11:32.040
Romantic.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.540
I know.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.060
I think that's
my neighbor.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.830
Where?

11:56.870 --> 11:57.900
The violinist.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.700
The teacher with those all
those annoying students?

12:01.770 --> 12:03.600
I didn't say they
were all bad.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.440
So are we doing anything
for New Years?

12:10.580 --> 12:12.150
I haven't even thought
about Christmas.

12:12.180 --> 12:13.750
All I can think about
these days

12:13.780 --> 12:15.450
is the looming deadline
for my book.

12:15.490 --> 12:18.120
Well maybe we can go to
the Black and White Ball

12:18.150 --> 12:19.320
at the Walker Museum?

12:19.360 --> 12:20.820
Yeah...About that...

12:39.240 --> 12:40.710
Any requests?

12:40.780 --> 12:43.380
We'd appreciate it if you could
play at someone else's table.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.380
We're just trying to
have a quiet dinner.

12:45.410 --> 12:46.110
Oh of course.

12:46.150 --> 12:46.950
I'm so sorry.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.480
I didn't mean to
disturb you.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.380
The way my students
obviously have.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.630
I guess she heard.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.200
What was that
all about?

13:01.230 --> 13:02.500
That's my neighbor.

13:02.530 --> 13:04.270
You know the one who won't
decorate for Christmas.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.470
Oh.

13:06.140 --> 13:09.170
Guess he's not much
of a music lover.

13:09.810 --> 13:11.370
He is kind of
cute, though.

13:16.550 --> 13:17.410
<i>Hello?</i>

13:17.450 --> 13:18.380
Mom?

13:18.410 --> 13:19.850
Hey, how's my favorite
daughter?

13:19.880 --> 13:23.020
As your only daughter that
joke never gets old.

13:23.050 --> 13:25.320
Shouldn't you be getting
on a plane right now?

13:25.350 --> 13:29.020
Yeah, uh, about that...Our
flight was cancelled.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.630
<i> Actually, all of the flights</i>
<i> were cancelled.</i>

13:31.660 --> 13:35.200
Their is a massive snowstorm
and everything's been shut down.

13:35.230 --> 13:36.230
Oh my.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.200
<i> Listen, how are</i>
<i> the kids?</i>

13:37.270 --> 13:37.800
Good, good.

13:37.830 --> 13:38.930
They're sleeping.

13:38.970 --> 13:40.370
Bruce is on the phone
trying to find out

13:40.400 --> 13:42.040
when we might get
a flight back.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.270
Don't you worry
about anything.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.710
They can stay with me
as long as you need.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.880
They're saying it's gonna
be four or five days,

13:47.940 --> 13:49.810
maybe even a week, before
the airport re-opens.

13:49.880 --> 13:50.340
A week?

13:50.380 --> 13:51.110
Oh my goodness!

13:51.180 --> 13:52.410
Mom, did you
hear that?

13:52.480 --> 13:53.950
I did.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.880
<i> We might not make it back</i>
<i> in time for Christmas.</i>

13:55.920 --> 13:58.490
<i> We've never missed a Christmas</i>
<i> with the kids before.</i>

13:58.520 --> 14:01.590
Sarah, do you mind looking after
the kids for another few days?

14:01.620 --> 14:02.490
Of course not.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.190
You know I love
to have them.

14:04.230 --> 14:04.690
Thanks mom.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.260
Love you.

14:05.290 --> 14:05.990
Bye!

14:06.060 --> 14:07.260
Take care you two.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.340
Whew!

14:21.380 --> 14:23.140
I did not think we were gonna
make it out of there

14:23.210 --> 14:24.450
in one piece.

14:24.510 --> 14:26.810
Remind me not to do anymore
Christmas shopping.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.720
At least for
a while.

14:29.220 --> 14:30.890
I can't believe after
all that shopping,

14:30.920 --> 14:33.090
and I still don't have
all of my presents.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.260
I mean I'm done.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.220
The last two things I
bought were for me.

14:36.260 --> 14:37.060
Oh.

14:37.130 --> 14:38.360
Do you have
time for tea?

14:38.430 --> 14:40.060
The Carlyle is doing their
special Christmas tea

14:40.100 --> 14:41.260
again this year.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.700
Oh I wish I could, but I
have to go to rehearsal.

14:43.770 --> 14:45.370
Noooo.

14:45.740 --> 14:48.170
Oh, before I forget, I
have something for you.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.300
What is it?

14:49.340 --> 14:51.040
It's an early Christmas
present.

14:53.510 --> 14:54.310
I don't understand.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.440
What's is it?

14:55.480 --> 14:58.680
It's the date and time
of your audition.

14:58.710 --> 15:00.680
I didn't agree
to this.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.250
What have you
got to lose?

15:03.850 --> 15:06.090
Oh, are we still on for
skating this week?

15:06.120 --> 15:06.690
Uh, yeah.

15:06.760 --> 15:07.820
Okay.

15:07.890 --> 15:08.560
Bye.

15:40.460 --> 15:41.090
Hi, mom.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
<i>Hello.</i>

15:42.190 --> 15:43.460
Before you say anything
I was gonna try

15:43.490 --> 15:46.130
and make it over there later
today to see the kids...

15:46.160 --> 15:47.590
You have to
come over now.

15:47.630 --> 15:49.130
<i> Why, what's wrong?</i>

15:49.170 --> 15:50.830
Oh, I think
it's the flu.

15:50.870 --> 15:54.230
I'm feeling achy all over,
and I think I have a fever.

15:54.270 --> 15:57.300
<i> And I'm in no condition</i>
<i> to look after the kids,</i>

15:57.340 --> 15:59.710
so you're gonna have to
come and pick them up.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.440
I can take them
for a day,

16:01.480 --> 16:03.940
but aren't Dana and Bruce
gonna be back tomorrow?

16:04.010 --> 16:05.010
<i> No.</i>

16:05.050 --> 16:06.510
<i> They're stuck</i>
<i> in Norway.</i>

16:06.550 --> 16:08.150
What does that
mean exactly?

16:08.180 --> 16:10.550
Haven't you been
listening to the news?

16:10.590 --> 16:12.550
No, I've been trying
to write a book.

16:12.590 --> 16:15.720
Northern Europe is covered
in a blanket of snow

16:15.760 --> 16:18.130
they're calling the snow
storm of the century.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.560
<i>So, you're gonna to have to come</i>
<i>over here and pick up the kids,</i>

16:21.600 --> 16:23.800
<i> and look after them</i>
<i> until I'm better,</i>

16:23.830 --> 16:25.700
<i> or until Dana and</i>
<i> Bruce get back.</i>

16:25.740 --> 16:27.270
<i> Whichever comes first.</i>

16:28.200 --> 16:29.770
<i> Eric?</i>

16:29.810 --> 16:31.370
<i> Are you still there?</i>

16:31.410 --> 16:32.570
Yeah.

16:32.610 --> 16:34.640
How long does a
flu usually last?

16:34.680 --> 16:35.340
Oh.

16:35.410 --> 16:37.380
At my age, who
knows?

16:37.410 --> 16:39.410
And why would anyone hold
a business conference

16:39.450 --> 16:42.380
in Norway in the middle
of the winter?

16:42.420 --> 16:45.290
Well you're gonna have to ask
Bruce that when you see him.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.620
Look honey, the kids
are all packed up.

16:47.660 --> 16:49.890
You just get here as
soon as you can.

16:57.470 --> 16:58.770
Cheque please.

17:07.780 --> 17:09.010
I brought you
some soup.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.109
Oh thank you, sweetheart.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.910
That was very
thoughtful.

17:11.980 --> 17:14.310
Mom, are you sure I should
be taking the kids?

17:14.349 --> 17:17.220
You know how bad my luck is
around this time of year.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.420
Are you still convinced you've
got that Christmas jinx?

17:19.460 --> 17:22.589
Why do you think I've gone out
of town the last four years?

17:22.630 --> 17:24.460
Well, you're stuck
in town now.

17:24.490 --> 17:25.890
Maybe you'll finally
get over it.

17:25.930 --> 17:26.630
Kids!

17:26.660 --> 17:28.400
Your Uncle Eric
is here.

17:28.430 --> 17:29.300
Come on!

17:29.670 --> 17:30.260
Okay, bye!

17:30.300 --> 17:31.670
Be good you two!

17:31.730 --> 17:32.730
<i>Bye Grandma!</i>

17:32.770 --> 17:33.930
<i>We will!</i>

17:35.240 --> 17:37.640
Who's ready to have some
fun with their Uncle Eric?

17:39.080 --> 17:40.740
We're not going
to fit in there.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.610
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

17:42.650 --> 17:45.250
I'm not sitting on
anyone's lap.

17:45.310 --> 17:47.010
I wasn't thinking that.

17:47.050 --> 17:48.320
We'll figure it out...

17:49.750 --> 17:52.690
Mom's car is just in the garage,
and it can fit all of us.

18:12.140 --> 18:13.710
Nice driving Uncle Eric.

18:13.740 --> 18:15.680
What, I'm not used
to driving this boat.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.780
Here let me take
that for you.

18:19.820 --> 18:20.980
You're my new
favourite.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.050
Dibs on the master.

18:24.090 --> 18:25.490
You're sleeping in
the basement.

18:27.590 --> 18:28.720
<i>Whoa</i>

18:31.530 --> 18:32.460
<i> Here we are.</i>

18:32.500 --> 18:34.060
Just get comfortable.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.460
Mi Casa...Su Casa.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.700
You've got no Christmas
decorations.

18:37.770 --> 18:40.030
Not that comfortable.

18:40.070 --> 18:42.240
How come you don't have
a Christmas tree?

18:42.270 --> 18:44.000
That's a long story.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.740
Don't you like
Christmas?

18:45.770 --> 18:47.880
Not particularly, no.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.740
How come?

18:49.780 --> 18:51.410
I'll tell you when
you're older.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.050
Gimme that.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.050
But Uncle Eric, if we don't
have a Christmas tree

18:56.090 --> 18:57.820
how will Santa
find us?

18:57.850 --> 19:01.760
Well maybe he's got
GPS or something.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.590
<i> And if we don't</i>
<i> have a tree,</i>

19:03.660 --> 19:05.930
where will we put
all the presents?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.260
What presents?

19:07.300 --> 19:09.660
And we always decorate the
tree, and string popcorn.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.330
And we have to make Christmas
cookies to leave for Santa.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.900
And we always hang
our stockings,

19:13.940 --> 19:15.800
and build a snowman...

19:16.170 --> 19:17.470
Aw, come on Chels.

19:17.510 --> 19:19.540
We're gonna have a
great time, I promise.

19:19.580 --> 19:20.570
How?

19:21.680 --> 19:22.610
I don't know.

19:22.650 --> 19:24.610
Let me think about
it for a minute.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.780
You got any ideas?

19:26.820 --> 19:28.180
Make Christmas for us.

19:33.190 --> 19:34.720
Right...

19:52.110 --> 19:53.670
<i>Uh, Eric, are</i>
<i> you okay?</i>

19:53.710 --> 19:54.680
Yep, yep.

19:54.710 --> 19:55.780
I'm up.

19:56.310 --> 19:57.710
<i> Uh, how are</i>
<i> the kids?</i>

19:57.750 --> 20:01.420
Um probably
still sleeping.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.350
<i> Look, I really can't</i>
<i> thank you enough.</i>

20:06.420 --> 20:09.260
Well, I don't think your kids
are gonna feel the same way.

20:09.330 --> 20:12.090
<i> Uh...Why's that?</i>

20:12.130 --> 20:13.530
You know I don't
do Christmas.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.100
<i> I know it's</i>
<i> asking a lot,</i>

20:15.160 --> 20:17.430
<i> but could you maybe just get</i>
<i> them a Christmas tree?</i>

20:17.470 --> 20:19.270
That is a big ask.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.900
<i> Okay Romeo.</i>

20:20.940 --> 20:24.440
<i> Listen, they're the only niece</i>
<i> and nephew you've got.</i>

20:31.750 --> 20:33.450
How about this one?

20:33.480 --> 20:34.650
No.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.690
This one's nice, right?

20:38.720 --> 20:40.650
It's not too small.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.260
It is too small.

20:42.290 --> 20:43.820
Okay, what'd you
have in mind?

20:43.860 --> 20:45.530
Something a lot bigger.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.500
Are you kidding me?

20:51.570 --> 20:53.500
This thing looks like it belongs
in Rockefeller Center.

20:53.540 --> 20:55.940
It's just like the ones Mom
and Dad always get.

20:55.970 --> 20:57.500
Are you sure?

20:57.540 --> 20:59.570
I don't recall them
being this big.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.240
Fine.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.080
Excuse me.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.680
We'll take this one.

21:08.020 --> 21:08.980
Okay, wait.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.180
I will get all of the
ingredients

21:10.220 --> 21:11.180
for the Christmas cookies.

21:11.220 --> 21:12.750
Okay, good.

21:12.790 --> 21:15.220
Oh, can you play at the
restaurant on Wednesday night?

21:15.260 --> 21:16.260
Can't.

21:16.330 --> 21:18.360
I am playing at an
anniversary party.

21:18.430 --> 21:20.360
Oh, that's too bad.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.330
Why?

21:21.360 --> 21:22.860
What are you up to?

21:22.900 --> 21:26.300
Steve maybe got the ER doctor to
come back on Wednesday night.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.000
He was gonna make a special
menu and everything.

21:29.370 --> 21:31.570
Maybe we could do it
Thursday night instead?

21:31.870 --> 21:33.370
That might work.

21:33.410 --> 21:35.680
I'm playing at a corporate
Christmas party that afternoon,

21:35.740 --> 21:38.910
but I could probably
get there by seven.

21:38.980 --> 21:41.450
Oh, have you given any more
thought to the audition?

21:41.480 --> 21:44.350
Opportunities do not come
around like this every day.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.920
I know, and I am
thinking about it.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.720
Okay good.

21:49.760 --> 21:50.620
I love you.

21:50.660 --> 21:51.790
I love you.

21:51.830 --> 21:52.490
Brat!

21:52.560 --> 21:53.590
<i> Yeah whatever.</i>

21:53.630 --> 21:55.500
Alright, I got this.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.800
<i>Be careful.</i>

22:03.340 --> 22:05.110
That wasn't good.

22:05.140 --> 22:06.840
That's quite a tree
you have there.

22:06.880 --> 22:07.810
Tell me about it.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.440
We picked it out
ourselves.

22:09.880 --> 22:10.840
I like your decorations.

22:10.880 --> 22:11.280
<i> Aw.</i>

22:11.350 --> 22:12.380
Thank you.

22:12.410 --> 22:13.150
Your kids?

22:13.180 --> 22:13.780
No!

22:13.820 --> 22:14.450
No.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.580
I don't have kids.

22:15.620 --> 22:16.880
<i> This is my niece</i>
<i> and nephew...</i>

22:16.920 --> 22:18.290
<i> Chelsea and Liam.</i>

22:18.320 --> 22:18.950
Hello.

22:18.990 --> 22:19.420
Hey Chelsea.

22:19.460 --> 22:20.350
Hey Liam.

22:20.420 --> 22:21.420
Sorry, I don't know
your name.

22:21.460 --> 22:22.660
April.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.490
And you're Uncle...

22:24.530 --> 22:25.490
Eric.

22:25.530 --> 22:26.330
Eric Redford.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.430
Nice to meet you.

22:27.460 --> 22:28.930
Uh...Can I help
you carry this?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.860
That'd be great,
thanks.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.870
Do you think Conrad
will notice?

22:34.900 --> 22:37.470
Ugh...He notices
everything.

22:38.370 --> 22:39.610
I got the door.

22:40.180 --> 22:42.980
At least you're better at
this than your driving.

22:43.010 --> 22:46.150
It's going to take a lot of
ornaments to fill up this tree.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.750
We forgot to buy
ornaments.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.320
Can't you just pretend
it has ornaments?

22:49.390 --> 22:51.720
<i> I mean you're kids, use</i>
<i> your imagination.</i>

22:51.790 --> 22:54.720
I don't think I can
pretend that good.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.890
Oh, come on Chels...

22:56.930 --> 22:59.830
the smell alone is plenty
Christmasy, right?

23:01.360 --> 23:02.200
Am I right?

23:02.230 --> 23:03.530
No!

23:03.570 --> 23:05.170
Look, I have a lot of extra
ornaments at my house

23:05.230 --> 23:06.130
that you can use.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.670
Of course you do.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.840
I bet the inside of your house
looks like Santa's workshop.

23:09.870 --> 23:10.940
Close to it.

23:10.970 --> 23:13.510
Wow, can we go over
there and see it?

23:13.540 --> 23:16.480
Maybe another time, Chelsea,
I've got a lot of work to do.

23:16.550 --> 23:18.210
Well, that's okay,
I can take them.

23:18.250 --> 23:19.680
I'm sure they'll
really love it.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.280
That's what I'm
afraid of.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.720
Please?

23:22.750 --> 23:23.850
Go ahead.

23:23.890 --> 23:25.550
<i> I'll be here with</i>
<i> the tree.</i>

23:25.620 --> 23:26.350
Bye Uncle Eric!

23:26.420 --> 23:27.650
Try not to break
anything!

23:27.720 --> 23:30.490
I'll just be here setting up
the Christmas tree.

23:30.830 --> 23:31.990
Fun, fun, fun.

23:33.060 --> 23:34.590
All by myself.

23:48.540 --> 23:49.940
Whoa.

23:50.210 --> 23:52.680
That's a lot of Christmas
decorations.

23:54.980 --> 23:57.680
Did somebody ask for
Christmas in a box?

24:00.620 --> 24:02.460
I love the reindeer!

24:02.520 --> 24:04.490
Here we can put
that on your hat.

24:06.230 --> 24:10.600
<i>You guys are doing</i>
<i> such a job with decorating.</i>

24:10.630 --> 24:12.900
<i> We definitely need more</i>
<i> ornaments you guys.</i>

24:21.810 --> 24:23.610
<i>Would you mind</i>
<i> turning that down?</i>

24:25.850 --> 24:27.380
What's your favourite
ornament guys?

24:27.450 --> 24:28.250
Whoah, whoah!

24:28.280 --> 24:29.550
<i> Hey!</i>

24:29.590 --> 24:32.320
That's exactly how I broke
my leg six years ago.

24:32.350 --> 24:34.150
Is that why you don't
like Christmas?

24:34.220 --> 24:35.760
One of the reasons.

24:36.490 --> 24:38.460
Well what do
you think?

24:39.760 --> 24:41.360
Is it possible it's
getting bigger?

24:41.400 --> 24:43.330
We haven't even turned
on the lights yet.

24:43.370 --> 24:45.300
Well who wants to
do the honors?

24:45.330 --> 24:47.100
Maybe Uncle Eric?

24:47.600 --> 24:48.800
How about Chelsea?

24:53.440 --> 24:54.610
Wow...

24:54.640 --> 24:56.110
Wow is right.

24:56.510 --> 25:00.650
That's the most beautiful
Christmas tree I've ever seen!

25:03.390 --> 25:06.920
Yeah...It, uh, looks,
uh...pretty good.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.160
Well, I should probably
get going.

25:10.190 --> 25:12.790
Thank you guys for letting me
help you decorate the tree.

25:12.830 --> 25:14.630
I'll walk you out.

25:14.700 --> 25:17.700
I feel like it needs more
sparkly things.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.340
Hey, uh...

25:22.370 --> 25:24.740
Thanks for doing all that for
my niece and nephew.

25:24.770 --> 25:27.240
Well, I guess it's no secret
that I love Christmas,

25:27.310 --> 25:30.140
and the way I look at it I
just got the chance

25:30.210 --> 25:32.150
to decorate a second
Christmas tree.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.680
You remind me of someone
I used to know.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.550
She was crazy about
Christmas, too.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.790
Well I hope I didn't bring
back any bad memories.

25:41.820 --> 25:43.220
Well, that's a whole
other reason

25:43.260 --> 25:44.460
why I don't like
Christmas.

25:44.490 --> 25:46.160
But you made the
kids very happy.

25:46.190 --> 25:49.400
I just hope it lasts until my
sister and her husband get back

25:49.430 --> 25:50.830
so I can finish
my book.

25:50.870 --> 25:52.930
Well, it was
my pleasure.

25:55.570 --> 25:57.300
Good luck with
that book.

25:57.340 --> 25:58.470
Thanks.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.280
What's going on?

26:35.310 --> 26:36.640
Maybe you could
tell me?

26:36.680 --> 26:38.680
<i> I found this thing</i>
<i> in my front lawn.</i>

26:38.710 --> 26:40.850
Do you happen to know
how he got here?

26:40.880 --> 26:41.680
No.

26:41.750 --> 26:42.920
I've never seen
him before.

26:42.950 --> 26:44.250
<i> What are you going</i>
<i> to do with him?</i>

26:44.290 --> 26:45.650
Curb him.

26:45.690 --> 26:50.060
And, hopefully whoever put
him here will take him back.

26:50.790 --> 26:52.190
I can see you!

26:52.690 --> 26:54.590
Would it really be
so hard for you

26:54.630 --> 26:56.060
to get into the
Christmas spirit?

26:56.100 --> 26:57.760
I mean just like
a little bit?

26:57.800 --> 26:59.570
What do you call that
Christmas tree

26:59.600 --> 27:01.270
that's taking up half
my living room?

27:01.340 --> 27:02.700
'Cause I call that
Christmas spirit...

27:02.770 --> 27:05.070
and then some.

27:05.110 --> 27:06.870
Maybe there's hope
for you yet.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.240
Hope for me?

27:17.190 --> 27:18.150
Come in.

27:19.290 --> 27:20.120
<i>Hey.</i>

27:20.190 --> 27:21.390
Hey.

27:21.420 --> 27:23.120
Oh, did I tell you I talked
to Mom last night?

27:23.160 --> 27:24.490
She's coming on
Christmas day!

27:24.560 --> 27:27.160
I know, I am so excited
to see her!

27:27.200 --> 27:28.530
She's gonna be
so happy.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.100
She misses the snow so much
now that she's in Florida.

27:31.130 --> 27:32.670
I know.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.830
Thank you so much for letting
me keep Steve's presents here.

27:34.870 --> 27:35.340
Oh yeah!

27:35.400 --> 27:36.370
No problem.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.140
Oh!

27:38.170 --> 27:40.770
I noticed your cute neighbor has
a Santa Claus on his lawn.

27:40.810 --> 27:44.480
Did he come around?

27:44.510 --> 27:47.150
No, not really, but he did
put up a Christmas tree

27:47.220 --> 27:49.650
for his niece and nephew while
they're staying with him.

27:49.690 --> 27:51.080
So cute.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.450
How do you
know that?

27:52.490 --> 27:55.060
Oh, I met him when he knocked
over Conrad's reindeer

27:55.090 --> 27:56.060
with his tree.

27:56.590 --> 27:59.090
Come again?

27:59.130 --> 28:00.330
It was this thing.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.160
But you know what?

28:02.200 --> 28:04.860
It turns out he's not really
that bad of a guy.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.370
You found out
all of this

28:06.400 --> 28:09.940
from a short conversation
on his front lawn?

28:09.970 --> 28:11.170
Easy.

28:11.210 --> 28:13.470
I helped him carry in
the Christmas tree...

28:13.510 --> 28:18.550
Then I helped him
decorated...It's no big deal.

28:18.610 --> 28:19.850
Stop.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.780
So...who is he?

28:23.820 --> 28:28.190
Well...His name
is Eric Redford.

28:28.220 --> 28:29.490
He's a writer.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.590
Wait!

28:30.630 --> 28:32.360
Eric Redford?

28:32.390 --> 28:34.060
Are you serious?

28:34.100 --> 28:34.790
What?

28:34.830 --> 28:36.330
Have you heard
of him?

28:36.400 --> 28:38.400
Only because of Steve.

28:38.430 --> 28:40.070
Steve owns like all
of his books.

28:40.140 --> 28:42.000
And his books are part
of the reason

28:42.070 --> 28:44.700
why Steve still has
not proposed.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.510
What kind of books
does he write?

28:47.240 --> 28:50.680
Only the kind that give men
great reasons to stay single.

28:51.610 --> 28:53.980
Uh-huh, yeah.

28:54.050 --> 28:55.420
That makes sense.

28:55.450 --> 28:57.050
<i>So how's it</i>
<i> going over there?</i>

28:57.120 --> 28:58.690
So far so good.

28:58.750 --> 29:01.920
<i> See, I told you there was no</i>
<i>such thing as a Christmas jinx.</i>

29:01.990 --> 29:03.320
<i> How's the book coming?</i>

29:03.360 --> 29:05.130
Slowly.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.190
How are you feeling?

29:07.230 --> 29:09.160
You ready to take the
kids back soon?

29:10.830 --> 29:14.330
I wish I could honey, but this
flu has really knocked me out.

29:14.370 --> 29:15.470
<i> I better go.</i>

29:15.500 --> 29:16.470
<i> I'll see you soon.</i>

29:17.540 --> 29:18.910
Talk to you soon.

29:26.180 --> 29:27.580
Okay...

29:34.460 --> 29:35.720
I'm working.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.390
<i>We're bored.</i>

29:39.430 --> 29:40.960
Hot on your tail.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.030
Nitrous!

29:43.470 --> 29:44.400
Here I come!

29:44.430 --> 29:45.060
Yeah!

29:45.100 --> 29:46.730
Oh making the pass!

29:47.170 --> 29:48.330
Look, there's the
finish line!

29:48.370 --> 29:49.340
Yes!

29:49.400 --> 29:50.270
Did you give me the bum
controller?

29:50.310 --> 29:51.500
No, you're just
not good.

29:51.540 --> 29:52.470
My controller's
not working.

29:52.510 --> 29:53.910
Come on! Come
on! Come on!

29:53.940 --> 29:54.640
Is that helping?

29:54.680 --> 29:55.580
Who's gonna win?

29:55.610 --> 29:56.280
Who's gonna win?

29:56.340 --> 29:57.040
Who's gonna win?

29:57.080 --> 29:57.340
Yes!

29:57.380 --> 29:58.710
I win!

29:58.780 --> 29:59.850
Way to go buddy.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.910
You did pretty good.

30:00.950 --> 30:03.080
Hey don't touch
the hair.

30:03.150 --> 30:04.220
Can I play?

30:04.290 --> 30:06.090
Uh no, it's almost
time for bed.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.090
And, I have some
writing to do tonight.

30:08.820 --> 30:10.290
Come on.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.660
Uncle Eric, when are you going
to buy your Christmas presents?

30:13.700 --> 30:14.390
The last minute.

30:14.460 --> 30:15.530
Why?

30:16.630 --> 30:18.600
Don't worry, you're
on my list.

30:18.630 --> 30:19.400
It's not that...

30:19.430 --> 30:20.730
Well then what's
the problem?

30:20.770 --> 30:23.900
We have to buy our Christmas
presents for mom and dad.

30:23.940 --> 30:24.670
Yeah.

30:24.710 --> 30:25.510
Could you take
us shopping?

30:25.540 --> 30:26.870
Sure I can do that.

30:26.940 --> 30:28.580
Come with me.

30:28.610 --> 30:32.610
This is how I shop for
Christmas every year.

30:36.990 --> 30:38.180
Gift cards.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.120
Makes life so
much easier.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.560
That's not how
we shop.

30:42.890 --> 30:44.320
We need art supplies...

30:44.360 --> 30:46.560
glue, paper, and glitter...

30:46.600 --> 30:49.000
You make your presents?

30:49.030 --> 30:50.160
<i> Yeah, some of them.</i>

30:50.230 --> 30:52.200
And besides, don't you
need gifts for like mom,

30:52.230 --> 30:54.270
dad and Grandma?

30:54.300 --> 30:55.270
And your friends?

30:55.300 --> 30:56.600
And us?

30:56.640 --> 30:58.710
Can't I just get you
guys gift cards too?

30:58.740 --> 31:00.210
No!

31:02.610 --> 31:05.610
It's eight days till Christmas,
the stores are gonna be packed.

31:05.650 --> 31:09.650
But we have to see Santa Claus,
and that's where he is.

31:10.350 --> 31:13.090
Santa Claus?

31:13.120 --> 31:14.750
You know like
jolly, hohoho...?

31:14.820 --> 31:15.590
Yeah, no.

31:15.660 --> 31:17.290
I get it, Liam.

31:17.330 --> 31:19.360
Please Uncle Eric?

31:19.390 --> 31:19.930
Please?

31:19.960 --> 31:20.730
Alright.

31:20.760 --> 31:23.030
Go get ready
for bed.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.570
Hey, Bridget...

31:32.640 --> 31:33.840
<i>Good morning.</i>

31:35.240 --> 31:36.410
<i> You're not calling to cancel</i>
<i> lunch are you?</i>

31:36.440 --> 31:37.740
How about we go Christmas
shopping instead?

31:37.810 --> 31:38.710
<i> I would love that.</i>

31:38.780 --> 31:39.910
Great.

31:39.950 --> 31:41.610
Oh and by the way I have
my niece and nephew

31:41.680 --> 31:42.850
so they'll be
coming too.

31:42.880 --> 31:43.680
<i> Oh...</i>

31:43.720 --> 31:44.620
Is that okay?

31:44.650 --> 31:46.050
<i> Oh yeah, sure.</i>

31:46.090 --> 31:47.220
<i> I love kids.</i>

31:47.260 --> 31:49.690
I'll pick you up
at noon.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.900
Christmas shopping?

31:57.330 --> 31:59.870
Isn't that a little
traditional for you?

31:59.900 --> 32:01.530
I suppose I
deserve that.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.540
Liam and Chelsea guilted
me into taking them.

32:03.570 --> 32:04.770
Oh, are they here?

32:04.840 --> 32:07.770
Yeah, they're waiting
in line to visit Santa.

32:07.810 --> 32:11.410
My uh, friend, Bridget's
over there with them.

32:11.480 --> 32:14.310
I thought I'd use the time
to buy my mom a gift.

32:14.380 --> 32:16.650
But I don't even know
where to begin.

32:18.650 --> 32:20.150
Would you have
any suggestions?

32:20.220 --> 32:22.220
They have some really
cute stuff over here.

32:22.260 --> 32:24.820
I found these adorable
Christmas socks...

32:29.360 --> 32:30.830
Okay, you're up next.

32:30.900 --> 32:33.100
<i>Ho-ho-ho,</i>
<i> now what's your name?</i>

32:33.170 --> 32:35.640
Are you Uncle
Eric's girlfriend?

32:35.670 --> 32:37.140
I think so.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.180
How much longer
is this gonna take?

32:44.210 --> 32:47.110
I don't know, but when it's
my turn to talk to Santa

32:47.150 --> 32:49.220
I have a big list.

32:50.390 --> 32:51.580
Oh, boy.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.820
He waved at me!

32:57.490 --> 33:00.090
Uh...well what did you
get her last year?

33:00.130 --> 33:01.260
A gift card.

33:01.530 --> 33:03.360
Okay...And the year
before that?

33:03.430 --> 33:05.370
A...gift card.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.530
And let me guess.

33:06.570 --> 33:08.770
You got her a gift card
the yard before that?

33:08.800 --> 33:09.770
Good guess.

33:10.940 --> 33:14.110
Have you ever done any
real Christmas shopping?

33:14.140 --> 33:17.180
The last year I did
someone stole my car.

33:17.210 --> 33:18.640
And it wasn't
just any car.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.410
It was a 1965 Corvette
Sting Ray.

33:21.450 --> 33:23.580
I bought it after I
sold my first book.

33:23.650 --> 33:26.020
They stole it right out of
the mall parking lot

33:26.050 --> 33:27.790
just before Christmas.

33:27.860 --> 33:30.160
That was six years ago.

33:30.190 --> 33:33.890
And is that the reason you
don't celebrate Christmas?

33:33.930 --> 33:35.500
Just another one
of the many.

33:36.130 --> 33:37.930
There are more?!

33:38.630 --> 33:39.570
Oh my gosh.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.970
What about Jewelry?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.370
This guy has some amazing
one-of-a-kind stuff.

33:46.410 --> 33:50.910
Now that's something
she would like.

33:50.980 --> 33:53.150
What about that necklace?

33:53.420 --> 33:55.050
That is pretty.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.280
Excuse me.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.220
Would you mind if we
took a look at this?

33:58.290 --> 33:59.620
<i> Sure thing.</i>

34:03.360 --> 34:04.890
That's beautiful.

34:06.090 --> 34:07.330
Would you try it on?

34:07.360 --> 34:09.000
Uh...Sure.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.639
It's beautiful.

34:21.909 --> 34:24.380
It really looks
nice on you.

34:24.409 --> 34:26.380
Thanks.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.380
You should get it.

34:28.420 --> 34:29.850
Oh no.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.620
I am not doing any Christmas
shopping for myself this year.

34:32.650 --> 34:35.889
You don't have anyone you could
drop a hint to this Christmas?

34:35.920 --> 34:36.889
No.

34:36.960 --> 34:37.860
Really?

34:37.929 --> 34:38.830
No.

34:38.889 --> 34:40.889
I didn't mean
anything by that.

34:40.929 --> 34:44.699
I just meant...that's
hard to believe.

34:49.900 --> 34:52.170
I guess Bridget could
use some saving.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.639
I should probably go.

34:53.940 --> 34:54.969
Yeah.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.610
Thanks for your
help...again.

35:03.820 --> 35:05.620
So we good now?

35:05.650 --> 35:07.620
You've got your tree,
your presents,

35:07.660 --> 35:09.760
and you visited
Santa today.

35:09.820 --> 35:12.260
<i> So we're done, right?</i>

35:12.490 --> 35:15.190
Yeah...I guess so.

35:15.230 --> 35:18.100
So why don't you go upstairs
and get ready for bed?

35:19.200 --> 35:20.700
I'm not tired.

35:20.740 --> 35:22.030
Really?

35:22.070 --> 35:23.640
I'm not tired either.

35:24.010 --> 35:26.010
Okay, so what do
you want to do?

35:26.040 --> 35:27.340
Can we watch
a movie?

35:27.640 --> 35:29.440
Please Uncle Eric?

35:29.940 --> 35:30.780
All right.

35:30.850 --> 35:32.250
You go pick
one out.

35:32.310 --> 35:33.950
I'll go make
the popcorn.

35:47.560 --> 35:52.370
Well, we've got an interesting
week of weather coming up...

35:57.140 --> 35:58.240
<i> Hello?...</i>

35:58.270 --> 35:59.440
<i>Sounds</i>
<i> like I woke you.</i>

35:59.510 --> 36:01.370
No...Liam and Chelsea
are asleep on the couch.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.140
We were watching a movie
and they passed out on me.

36:04.180 --> 36:06.780
<i> Aww that's adorable.</i>

36:06.810 --> 36:08.110
So how are
you feeling?

36:10.650 --> 36:12.020
Well, a little better.

36:12.050 --> 36:13.820
My throat is
still scratchy.

36:13.860 --> 36:15.520
How are you making
out over there?

36:15.560 --> 36:17.390
I took the kids Christmas
shopping today.

36:17.460 --> 36:19.330
<i> Next thing you know</i>
<i> you'll be telling me</i>

36:19.390 --> 36:20.890
<i> you bought a</i>
<i> Christmas tree.</i>

36:20.930 --> 36:22.660
Oh, we got a
Christmas tree.

36:23.160 --> 36:24.500
<i> That was Dana's idea.</i>

36:24.530 --> 36:26.930
But Liam and Chelsea have talked
me into everything else.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.130
Everything else?

36:28.170 --> 36:29.600
You know, everything
they normally do

36:29.640 --> 36:31.100
during Christmas time.

36:31.140 --> 36:33.340
<i> I don't know how Dana and</i>
<i> Bruce do it every year.</i>

36:34.380 --> 36:35.810
Well, you stay strong,
sweetheart.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.910
<i> And remember,</i>
<i> you're the boss.</i>

36:37.950 --> 36:38.910
Give them my love.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.680
I will.

36:45.050 --> 36:46.690
Okay, now you have
everything you need

36:46.750 --> 36:48.350
to make your Christmas
cards, right?

36:48.390 --> 36:49.360
Uh-huh.

36:49.390 --> 36:50.520
Because I need to
work undisturbed

36:50.560 --> 36:52.660
for the next few hours,
so unless it's really,

36:52.730 --> 36:54.890
really important you're
on your own.

36:54.930 --> 36:55.730
We good?

36:55.760 --> 36:56.730
Yep!

36:56.800 --> 36:58.260
We're gonna be busy
for a long time.

36:58.300 --> 36:59.100
Great.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.200
Hopefully I
will be, too.

37:01.100 --> 37:03.000
Where do we start?

37:03.040 --> 37:05.500
<i> ♪ The stars hung</i>
<i> on the tree ♪</i>

37:05.540 --> 37:10.380
<i> ♪ But it's just not the same</i>
<i>'cause you're not here with me ♪</i>

37:10.410 --> 37:15.180
<i> ♪ Santa if you hear me I hope</i>
<i> you got my list ♪</i>

37:15.220 --> 37:17.550
<i> ♪ 'Cause all I want for</i>
<i> Christmas ♪</i>

37:17.590 --> 37:23.820
<i> ♪ is the perfect Christmas</i>
<i> kiss from my baby ♪</i>

37:25.790 --> 37:28.530
I'm gonna spill this
all over the kitchen.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.800
A tablespoon of
this, right?

37:29.830 --> 37:30.630
Yep.

37:30.670 --> 37:31.560
No!

37:40.980 --> 37:42.010
What's up?

37:42.040 --> 37:43.210
We ran out
of glue.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.650
I was wondering if we
could go over to April's

37:45.680 --> 37:47.180
and see if she
has any?

37:47.580 --> 37:48.950
Yeah, sure.

37:57.460 --> 37:59.460
I'm gonna use gold.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.270
It is awfully quiet
out there.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.070
Hey, guys...

38:16.740 --> 38:17.780
Kids, where are you?

38:20.620 --> 38:22.150
Liam...

38:22.480 --> 38:24.020
Chelsea...

38:26.990 --> 38:28.520
Liam?!

38:29.860 --> 38:31.020
Chelsea?!

38:35.830 --> 38:36.860
Hey.

38:36.900 --> 38:38.100
Are Chelsea and
Liam here?

38:38.130 --> 38:38.900
Yeah.

38:39.730 --> 38:40.600
Sorry.

38:40.670 --> 38:41.400
That's okay.

38:41.470 --> 38:42.700
You want to
come in?

38:42.770 --> 38:44.300
Sure.

38:46.970 --> 38:47.970
<i> Nice place.</i>

38:48.010 --> 38:49.740
<i>Pink one...</i>

38:49.780 --> 38:53.810
<i> So focused on my writing and</i>
<i> I didn't even know they left.</i>

38:53.850 --> 38:55.350
Hey guys.

38:55.580 --> 38:56.780
This is my sister, Elaine.

38:56.850 --> 38:58.580
Hi, you must
be Eric.

38:59.190 --> 39:00.350
Sorry.

39:00.420 --> 39:01.150
Cookies...

39:01.220 --> 39:02.620
Yes, I am Eric.

39:02.690 --> 39:04.390
Nice to meet
you, Elaine.

39:04.460 --> 39:06.160
Looks like you two
have been busy.

39:06.190 --> 39:07.160
We're making Christmas
cookies.

39:07.230 --> 39:08.530
I can see that.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.760
Yeah, these are for the
neighborhood Christmas caroling.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.970
It's on December twenty-second
if you wanna join us.

39:13.030 --> 39:14.730
I'm not much
of a singer.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.540
Can we stay a
little longer?

39:16.600 --> 39:18.000
Yeah, there's a whole
other batch

39:18.040 --> 39:19.240
of cookies we
can decorate.

39:19.270 --> 39:20.740
Well that's not
up to me.

39:20.810 --> 39:22.440
I don't mind if
you don't mind.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.180
I don't mind.

39:23.240 --> 39:23.880
Alright.

39:23.910 --> 39:24.780
I'll take that.

39:24.850 --> 39:26.050
Alright, well you
two be good.

39:26.080 --> 39:26.410
Okay?

39:26.480 --> 39:27.010
We will.

39:27.050 --> 39:28.080
Alright, have fun.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.050
Bye.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.420
Bye.

39:32.890 --> 39:33.620
You collect vinyl?

39:33.650 --> 39:34.620
Yeah.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.260
You mind if I take a look?

39:37.330 --> 39:37.690
No.

39:37.730 --> 39:38.920
Go ahead.

39:42.330 --> 39:43.700
Nice collection.

39:44.030 --> 39:45.430
I'm a jazz man
myself.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.600
Oh, I've heard.

39:46.630 --> 39:47.570
<i> A little too loud?</i>

39:47.600 --> 39:48.730
Well...

39:48.800 --> 39:50.640
Sorry about that.

39:50.670 --> 39:51.540
That's okay.

39:51.570 --> 39:53.040
At least you've
got good taste.

39:53.070 --> 39:54.040
Thank you.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.080
Wow.

39:57.110 --> 39:58.040
Yeah.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.310
A lot of those belonged
to my dad,

39:59.350 --> 40:02.480
and when he passed away
he left them to me.

40:02.550 --> 40:04.520
I've just been adding
to them ever since.

40:05.390 --> 40:08.390
He was a jazz
pianist, actually.

40:08.420 --> 40:10.890
He taught me
everything I know.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.990
And now the student
has become the teacher.

40:13.460 --> 40:16.100
You got to stick to
what you do best.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.130
I get that.

40:17.170 --> 40:18.460
It's basically what
I've been doing

40:18.500 --> 40:20.470
the past few years
with my writing.

40:20.500 --> 40:24.070
Except lately it's been
a bit of a struggle.

40:24.570 --> 40:25.940
Not that I don't
love writing.

40:26.010 --> 40:26.870
I do.

40:26.910 --> 40:28.070
It's just...

40:28.110 --> 40:30.210
And apparently you love
what you write about.

40:30.710 --> 40:32.110
The whole bachelor
lifestyle and all.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.150
Yeah, well believe it or
not, there's more

40:34.180 --> 40:36.620
to me than just
being a bachelor.

40:36.650 --> 40:37.780
Oh.

40:37.820 --> 40:39.950
So the Corvette, late nights,
and poker games,

40:39.990 --> 40:42.120
are not really you?

40:42.890 --> 40:45.460
Maybe not so
much anymore.

40:45.690 --> 40:48.360
I mean after all, I am driving
a minivan these days

40:48.400 --> 40:49.800
and I kind
of like it.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.140
How did he get back
on my lawn?

41:00.910 --> 41:02.270
I have no idea.

41:03.310 --> 41:04.540
Well, he's not
staying there.

41:06.310 --> 41:08.510
I'll bring the kids back
in about an hour.

41:08.580 --> 41:09.320
Thanks.

41:22.100 --> 41:24.600
Here's Mr. Moose,
Chelsea.

41:24.630 --> 41:26.870
We got a fresh
bucket of popcorn.

41:26.900 --> 41:29.070
So, my buddies are gonna
be here any second.

41:29.140 --> 41:30.540
What do you
wanna to do?

41:30.570 --> 41:32.640
Wanna play a game,
watch TV, read?

41:32.670 --> 41:34.710
Could we read one
of your books?

41:34.740 --> 41:36.910
Mom and Dad talk about
them all the time.

41:36.940 --> 41:37.480
Oh yeah?

41:37.550 --> 41:38.580
What do they say?

41:38.610 --> 41:40.310
Mom says they're
juvenile.

41:40.350 --> 41:42.720
That means they're
for kids, right?

41:42.750 --> 41:44.220
Not intentionally, no.

41:44.820 --> 41:47.420
Look, why don't you just
watch T.V., okay?

41:47.460 --> 41:49.460
I'll be up later to
check on you.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.090
Okay.

41:50.160 --> 41:50.560
<i> You okay, Chels?</i>

41:50.590 --> 41:51.660
Yep.

41:52.460 --> 41:53.760
Do you like
this show?

41:53.790 --> 41:54.390
Yeah.

41:54.430 --> 41:55.860
How's that?

41:55.900 --> 41:56.800
Awesome.

41:56.830 --> 41:58.260
Does Mr. Moose
like that show?

41:58.300 --> 42:00.130
Mr. Moose do you
like that show?

42:00.200 --> 42:01.370
Yes I do.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.140
Yes he does.

42:07.980 --> 42:09.510
Is that glitter on
the table?

42:09.580 --> 42:11.510
<i> Yeah, I thought I</i>
<i> cleaned all that up.</i>

42:11.550 --> 42:13.510
Chelsea and Liam were making
their Christmas cards.

42:13.550 --> 42:15.510
Aww!

42:15.580 --> 42:17.420
Hey, anyone find that
Furry Murray toy yet?

42:17.450 --> 42:18.750
I did.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.860
I saw it at the
Christmas market.

42:22.890 --> 42:23.860
What?

42:23.890 --> 42:24.990
It was on Chelsea's
Christmas list.

42:25.030 --> 42:26.460
Well, I don't know what's
happening anymore.

42:26.490 --> 42:27.130
I'm out.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.030
Me too.

42:28.060 --> 42:29.560
Come to papa.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.600
Hey, I'm getting up, you
guys want anything?

42:31.630 --> 42:32.160
Some pretzels.

42:32.230 --> 42:33.200
All right.

42:35.400 --> 42:38.340
Could you not leave your empty
beer cans lying around.

42:38.370 --> 42:40.240
There's kids in the
house, you know.

42:40.270 --> 42:41.810
Who are you right now?

42:41.840 --> 42:44.040
Yeah, and what have
you done with Eric?

42:44.080 --> 42:45.580
Very funny.

42:45.610 --> 42:47.480
Seriously, all of a sudden it's
like playing poker with Mr. Mom.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.650
So you're basically telling me
the reason we always

42:49.720 --> 42:52.620
play poker here is because I
don't have a wife and kids?

42:52.650 --> 42:53.690
Well, yeah.

42:53.750 --> 42:55.690
There's no way my
wife would let me

42:55.720 --> 42:58.660
have three rowdy guys playing
cards till two in the morning.

42:58.690 --> 43:01.790
Or have a bunch of guys over
to watch a game every week.

43:01.860 --> 43:03.730
Face it, you're the last
man Standing, bro.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.730
It's not that we don't
love our families,

43:05.770 --> 43:07.230
it's just...

43:07.270 --> 43:09.130
It's just here you can put your
glasses down on the counter

43:09.170 --> 43:12.040
without a coaster, you can eat
all the junk food you want,

43:12.070 --> 43:14.710
and we can be loud and rowdy
without waking the kids.

43:14.740 --> 43:15.840
Amen.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.010
What do you think I've
been writing about

43:17.080 --> 43:18.240
for the last
seven years?

43:18.280 --> 43:19.210
I have no idea.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.150
I've never read
any of your books.

43:24.590 --> 43:25.990
Why do I invite
this guy?

43:26.020 --> 43:26.820
I don't know.

43:26.850 --> 43:28.320
I didn't know
you did.

43:28.390 --> 43:29.720
It's your deal.

43:29.760 --> 43:30.760
Okay.

43:38.570 --> 43:40.870
Bonjour

43:41.370 --> 43:42.330
How was the
performance?

43:42.370 --> 43:43.100
It was good.

43:43.140 --> 43:44.400
I'm starving.

43:44.710 --> 43:47.710
Tonight our special is
Omble Chevalier

43:47.780 --> 43:50.110
with a saffron semolina.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.350
It's my Grandmother's
recipe, and it's to die for.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.980
That sounds very cute.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.580
How's April doing
with the doctor?

43:56.620 --> 43:58.320
Oh, it's really going
well, I think.

43:58.350 --> 43:59.350
He's on the move.

43:59.420 --> 44:00.320
Now's your time.

44:00.390 --> 44:01.550
For what?

44:01.590 --> 44:04.020
You know, to
ask her.

44:04.060 --> 44:05.260
Ugh!

44:05.290 --> 44:07.390
Fine.

44:09.300 --> 44:10.900
Go!

44:11.500 --> 44:12.260
Hey!

44:12.300 --> 44:14.030
Hey!

44:14.070 --> 44:16.170
I wanted to bug you
about your audition.

44:16.670 --> 44:19.570
I have been practicing, if
that's what you want to know.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.510
I talked with the conductor
about you tonight.

44:21.580 --> 44:23.280
He's really excited to
hear you play.

44:23.310 --> 44:24.910
Okay.

44:25.810 --> 44:27.780
How are things going
with the doctor?

44:27.820 --> 44:28.950
He seems nice.

44:28.980 --> 44:30.480
Aw, I'm so happy
for you.

44:30.520 --> 44:33.290
I said he
seems nice.

44:33.320 --> 44:34.850
Okay, whatever.

44:35.260 --> 44:38.190
So, Steve has a favor to ask,
but he is too embarrassed

44:38.260 --> 44:40.790
to do it himself, so he
has recruited me.

44:40.830 --> 44:42.930
What is it?

44:42.960 --> 44:45.460
He would like to know if you
would ask your neighbor

44:45.530 --> 44:47.330
to sign a few of
his books?

44:47.670 --> 44:48.670
I know...

44:48.700 --> 44:49.740
it's really embarrassing
coming from me,

44:49.770 --> 44:52.740
given what I think
about them but...

44:52.810 --> 44:54.170
Yeah.

44:56.540 --> 44:58.510
Oh these are
too amazing.

44:58.550 --> 45:00.780
I mean, of course,
yes I will ask him!

45:01.980 --> 45:03.420
The things we
do for love.

45:06.620 --> 45:07.890
Help me.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.190
Do you smell that?

45:12.230 --> 45:15.160
I don't know but I wanna thank
you for a wonderful evening

45:15.200 --> 45:16.200
because that
was awesome.

45:16.230 --> 45:17.830
Can't believe Ryan
won it all, right?

45:17.900 --> 45:19.300
There's a first time
for everything.

45:19.370 --> 45:21.500
You hit a set of
five on a river.

45:21.540 --> 45:23.300
It was like the luckiest
hand ever.

45:23.340 --> 45:24.300
No, no, no.

45:24.370 --> 45:25.840
You gotta to know
when to fold'em.

45:25.870 --> 45:26.870
Okay.

45:26.910 --> 45:27.670
<i> I'll win again</i>
<i> next week.</i>

45:27.710 --> 45:28.940
<i> You keep thinking that.</i>

45:33.280 --> 45:34.910
Hey man, next week?

45:34.950 --> 45:37.080
Yeah, next week.

45:37.150 --> 45:38.020
Later guys.

45:38.050 --> 45:39.280
See ya!

46:27.230 --> 46:29.170
You gotta be
kidding me!

46:52.490 --> 46:54.290
Come on man,
give it up!

46:54.360 --> 46:57.800
I don't want your little Santa,
or your snowman!

46:57.830 --> 46:59.770
I haven't a clue what
you're rambling about.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.070
I'm talking about
these decorations

47:01.140 --> 47:02.970
you keep leaving
on my lawn.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.740
Not the guilty party.

47:04.770 --> 47:06.540
Well then, who is?

47:07.070 --> 47:11.080
Well maybe, you've been visited
by some Christmas elves.

48:08.770 --> 48:09.130
Hey.

48:09.170 --> 48:09.770
Hey.

48:09.800 --> 48:10.570
Come on in.

48:10.600 --> 48:11.570
Thanks.

48:11.610 --> 48:13.540
Brr...

48:16.180 --> 48:17.110
You bought my books?

48:17.140 --> 48:19.950
Oh, no not me.

48:19.980 --> 48:21.750
These are my sister's
boyfriend's books.

48:21.780 --> 48:25.620
He's a huge fan and he asked me
if you would sign them.

48:25.650 --> 48:27.020
I-I hope you
don't mind.

48:27.050 --> 48:29.350
No, it's fine.

48:29.390 --> 48:31.290
Oh my god!

48:31.330 --> 48:33.090
<i> That is so sweet.</i>

48:34.630 --> 48:37.130
I was wondering where all my
socks have been disappearing to.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.600
Here.

48:38.630 --> 48:39.430
Oh, thanks.

48:39.470 --> 48:40.870
Yeah.

48:40.900 --> 48:43.640
So I uhh, noticed you had
a late night last night.

48:44.100 --> 48:46.340
I noticed that you
had a late night, too.

48:46.370 --> 48:47.540
New boyfriend?

48:47.610 --> 48:49.780
No, just a blind date.

48:49.810 --> 48:51.240
How'd it go?

48:52.010 --> 48:53.610
Pretty good.

48:53.650 --> 48:57.180
I think that uhh, we will
be going out again, so...

48:57.220 --> 48:58.080
Hmm.

48:58.150 --> 48:59.650
So who should I
sign these to?

48:59.690 --> 49:01.520
Steve.

49:01.560 --> 49:04.460
To little Steve.

49:04.490 --> 49:05.990
I don't know what
that means.

49:06.060 --> 49:08.190
To Steve.

49:09.030 --> 49:10.800
Go get em', Tiger.

49:12.100 --> 49:16.370
To my good
buddy, Steve.

49:17.810 --> 49:19.000
Never give up.

49:19.270 --> 49:20.840
Eric.

49:22.810 --> 49:24.080
Another satisfied customer.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.180
Thank you very much!

49:26.210 --> 49:28.750
He will be
very happy.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.520
Anyways, I should
go practice.

49:38.030 --> 49:39.930
You sound amazing.

49:41.200 --> 49:44.360
I heard you when I
was outside earlier.

49:44.430 --> 49:46.100
Oh, well...

49:46.130 --> 49:47.600
I hope I wasn't
too loud?

49:47.670 --> 49:49.030
Not at all.

49:49.100 --> 49:51.240
Wasn't that Debussy
you were playing?

49:51.270 --> 49:52.540
Yeah.

49:52.570 --> 49:54.210
The girl with The
Flaxen Hair.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.610
I've never heard that
as a violin solo.

49:56.640 --> 49:58.840
You're really talented.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.210
Thank you.

50:00.910 --> 50:02.950
I just wish that talent
was enough.

50:03.420 --> 50:04.980
What do you mean?

50:05.020 --> 50:08.220
Uhh, I have this audition
with the Philharmonic

50:08.260 --> 50:11.860
and I have this history of
botching my auditions.

50:11.930 --> 50:12.990
How?

50:17.970 --> 50:19.360
Hiccups.

50:20.330 --> 50:21.400
What!?

50:21.470 --> 50:22.970
Don't laugh, it's serious.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.940
I get the worst hiccups
when I'm nervous.

50:24.970 --> 50:28.810
Okay, well then we need to find
a way for you to not be nervous.

50:28.840 --> 50:29.940
Here.

50:31.910 --> 50:34.010
How does someone get
over stage fright?

50:34.750 --> 50:35.810
Technology, it's the best.

50:35.880 --> 50:37.550
<i> Okay, I found this</i>
<i> on the web</i>

50:37.580 --> 50:39.750
<i> for "how do you get</i>
<i> over stage fright."</i>

50:39.790 --> 50:41.690
Okay we got something.

50:41.720 --> 50:42.620
Method one...

50:42.690 --> 50:44.920
try chewing gum to
relax your body.

50:44.960 --> 50:47.590
No, definitely do not wanna do
that while playing the violin.

50:47.630 --> 50:50.300
No, that sounds
very stupid.

50:50.330 --> 50:50.830
Alright.

50:50.860 --> 50:52.260
Method two...

50:52.300 --> 50:55.030
meditate for 15-20 minutes
before going on stage.

50:55.070 --> 50:56.170
That could be good.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.170
No, I've tried that.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.100
Sounds good.

50:58.140 --> 50:59.340
It didn't work
for me.

50:59.370 --> 51:01.810
Okay, moving on.

51:01.840 --> 51:02.970
Method three...

51:03.010 --> 51:04.610
laugh as much
as you can.

51:05.350 --> 51:06.480
It does not
say that!

51:06.510 --> 51:07.580
What?

51:07.610 --> 51:08.710
You think I'm making
this stuff it up.

51:08.750 --> 51:10.680
Look.

51:10.720 --> 51:12.980
Umm, yeah no, it
does say that!

51:13.020 --> 51:14.090
Yeah, it does.

51:14.120 --> 51:15.120
It definitely says that.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.660
I don't think that'll
work though.

51:16.690 --> 51:21.760
Okay, well, method four seems
a little bit more reasonable...

51:21.830 --> 51:25.300
Imagine that every seat in the
audience is filled with a clone

51:25.330 --> 51:26.700
of your favorite person,

51:26.730 --> 51:28.730
preferably someone who
encourages you.

51:29.770 --> 51:32.370
Well, that does seem
very reasonable.

51:32.410 --> 51:36.240
And I'm sure you have plenty of
people who would fit the bill.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.240
I have one
or two.

51:38.750 --> 51:40.780
Great, then you're covered.

51:42.420 --> 51:43.680
Thanks.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.220
And thank you
for these.

51:45.250 --> 51:46.790
Anytime.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.050
See ya.

51:49.090 --> 51:50.060
Bye.

51:57.430 --> 51:58.730
Hi, Bridget.

51:58.770 --> 52:00.770
Uh, hi.

52:01.570 --> 52:04.240
I didn't realize they were
coming to the party with us.

52:04.270 --> 52:05.900
<i> I couldn't leave them</i>
<i> with a stranger.</i>

52:05.940 --> 52:08.110
<i>What about that music</i>
<i> teacher neighbor of yours?</i>

52:08.140 --> 52:09.610
April?

52:09.640 --> 52:11.340
I barely know her and besides,
Nick set up a screening room

52:11.380 --> 52:14.280
in one of the offices, they've
got a ton of kids movies.

52:14.310 --> 52:16.950
Uncle Eric told us to be on
our best behavior tonight.

52:17.020 --> 52:19.320
And be extra
nice to you.

52:22.220 --> 52:23.420
<i>Okay...</i>

52:33.400 --> 52:35.800
All the kids are having
a great time in there.

52:35.840 --> 52:37.800
<i> ♪</i> Yeah, that was
a great idea.

52:37.840 --> 52:38.970
Thanks, Nick.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.370
Your date doesn't
look too happy.

52:41.680 --> 52:44.580
She didn't expect me to bring
Liam and Chelsea out with us.

52:44.610 --> 52:47.280
I guess you'll have to make
that up to her, huh?

52:47.310 --> 52:47.810
Yeah.

52:47.850 --> 52:49.150
Thanks.

52:49.220 --> 52:52.050
I hate to bug you, but umm,
how's the book coming?

52:52.120 --> 52:54.290
Not much better than the
last time you asked.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.350
Have you tried writing in
a different environment?

52:56.390 --> 52:57.720
That might help.

52:57.790 --> 52:59.520
I've tried every coffee house
and park bench in town.

52:59.560 --> 53:03.800
Mhm, are you gonna be able
to make your deadline?

53:03.830 --> 53:05.960
I hate to say it,
but if you don't,

53:06.000 --> 53:09.030
you could be in
breach of contract.

53:09.070 --> 53:09.770
But no pressure.

53:09.800 --> 53:10.440
Mmmm.

53:10.470 --> 53:11.570
Thanks for that, Nick.

53:11.970 --> 53:14.010
I-I guess I'm gonna
go mingle.

53:14.040 --> 53:15.440
You do that.

53:21.220 --> 53:22.710
<i> Hey, neighbor!</i>

53:22.780 --> 53:24.320
Hey.

53:24.380 --> 53:26.420
Nice candy-canes!

53:26.490 --> 53:28.750
Thanks, want me to put
some in your yard?

53:29.590 --> 53:31.060
No, I'm good.

53:31.990 --> 53:34.130
Hey umm, do you like ice
skating cause Elaine

53:34.160 --> 53:35.730
and I are gonna
go tonight.

53:35.760 --> 53:38.160
I thought maybe you and
the kids could tag along?

53:38.200 --> 53:40.130
That sounds fun,
but uhh, I can't,

53:40.170 --> 53:42.100
I have a
prior thing.

53:42.140 --> 53:44.340
But thanks, the kids
would've loved that...

53:44.370 --> 53:46.000
Well, they're welcome
to come with us,

53:46.070 --> 53:46.970
if you don't mind.

53:47.040 --> 53:49.010
No, you've
done enough...

53:50.610 --> 53:52.010
I wouldn't want
to impose.

53:52.080 --> 53:54.050
Not at all,
it'd be fun.

53:54.080 --> 53:54.480
<i> Really?</i>

53:54.510 --> 53:55.380
Yeah.

53:55.420 --> 53:57.880
Okay, I'll let
em' know.

53:57.920 --> 53:58.720
Okay, cool.

53:58.750 --> 53:59.520
Thanks.

53:59.550 --> 53:59.990
Alright, see
ya later.

54:00.020 --> 54:01.290
See ya.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.460
Sure you don't want
some candy canes?

54:04.520 --> 54:05.490
I'm good.

54:11.400 --> 54:13.630
This is absolutely
delicious.

54:13.670 --> 54:15.600
Where did you learn
to cook like this?

54:15.640 --> 54:18.340
Well, I started when I was
writing my bachelor's cookbook.

54:18.610 --> 54:20.640
You know, at first
it was research...

54:20.710 --> 54:22.710
turns out I was
pretty good at it.

54:22.740 --> 54:25.810
Well, thank you for making
this a special evening.

54:27.110 --> 54:29.350
I know I've been a little
distracted lately,

54:29.380 --> 54:31.950
but things will get better
once I finish my book.

54:31.990 --> 54:34.450
Once your sister gets back
and picks up the kids.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.420
Yeah, well that too.

54:38.260 --> 54:41.130
You should have heard Chelsea
and Liam on the phone with Dana.

54:41.160 --> 54:42.830
<i> You know, they</i>
<i> were just going on</i>

54:42.860 --> 54:45.230
<i> about how much fun</i>
<i> they're having with me.</i>

54:45.300 --> 54:48.400
I'd say you're having as
much fun as they are.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.340
Why shouldn't I?

54:51.370 --> 54:54.140
They are my niece
and nephew.

54:54.210 --> 54:56.880
Because one of the things that
first attracted me to you

54:56.940 --> 54:59.380
is the fact you
don't have kids.

54:59.410 --> 55:01.750
Lately you've been acting
more like a doting father

55:01.820 --> 55:04.280
than someone who writes
about being a single guy.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.780
Well, what's wrong
with that?

55:07.150 --> 55:11.860
The truth is, Eric, you're
nothing like your books at all.

55:19.970 --> 55:22.270
So, where's the handsome
uncle tonight?

55:22.300 --> 55:23.740
He had plans.

55:23.770 --> 55:27.610
Well, you're a very
good neighbor.

55:27.640 --> 55:30.210
Is there something going
on between you two?

55:30.240 --> 55:31.780
You are incorrigible.

55:31.810 --> 55:32.580
What?

55:32.610 --> 55:33.950
It's my job to
be a pest!

55:34.010 --> 55:36.380
If I don't find you a handsome
husband, who's going to?

55:36.450 --> 55:37.480
I will!

55:37.520 --> 55:39.580
I will find myself a
handsome husband.

55:39.620 --> 55:42.790
I like the kids, they like me
and we are having fun.

55:42.820 --> 55:45.890
Right and there's nothing
romantic between you two.

55:45.930 --> 55:47.460
No.

55:48.100 --> 55:50.630
Then uhh, I guess
we're all good here.

55:53.970 --> 55:56.770
Hey, you're here early.

55:56.840 --> 56:00.410
Yeah my uhh, prior engagement
didn't go so well.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.340
The woman from
the restaurant.

56:02.380 --> 56:03.510
Yeah.

56:03.540 --> 56:05.080
Uncle Eric,
look at me!

56:05.880 --> 56:07.180
Wow, Chelsea.

56:07.210 --> 56:09.110
You're an amazing
skater.

56:09.150 --> 56:10.450
I know.

56:10.480 --> 56:11.280
And humble.

56:13.420 --> 56:15.920
Hey guys, do you wanna go
get some hot chocolate.

56:15.960 --> 56:16.620
Yes!

56:16.660 --> 56:18.360
Of course!

56:19.060 --> 56:21.260
It's not even a question,
everybody loves hot chocolate.

56:21.290 --> 56:22.430
I know.

56:23.260 --> 56:24.160
Come join us!

56:24.200 --> 56:26.030
Nah, I'm
good here.

56:26.070 --> 56:28.430
I'm not gonna take
no for an answer.

56:28.470 --> 56:29.700
I don't have
any skates.

56:29.740 --> 56:31.470
They rent them here.

56:32.710 --> 56:34.140
Come on!

56:36.310 --> 56:37.210
I'll be right back.

56:37.280 --> 56:38.510
I'll show you
my moves!

56:38.580 --> 56:40.250
My super- Oh, did you
see that?

56:40.280 --> 56:41.550
I just turned.

56:45.120 --> 56:47.050
Thanks again for looking
after the kids tonight,

56:47.090 --> 56:48.850
they really love spending
time with you.

56:48.890 --> 56:49.850
Well, they're great.

56:51.360 --> 56:53.460
I'm sorry that your previous
engagement didn't turn out well.

56:53.490 --> 56:57.360
Well apparently, Bridget prefers
me as an unencumbered single guy

56:57.400 --> 56:58.600
without any kids around.

56:58.630 --> 57:01.000
So she would prefer to
be with the kind of guy

57:01.070 --> 57:02.870
that you write about
in your books?

57:02.900 --> 57:03.570
Wait, you--

57:03.600 --> 57:04.740
I-I read your books.

57:04.810 --> 57:07.070
The ones that you
signed for Steve.

57:07.110 --> 57:08.910
You hated them,
didn't you?

57:08.940 --> 57:10.410
Actually no, I didn't.

57:10.440 --> 57:12.780
I thought that there was an
honesty to what you were saying.

57:12.810 --> 57:14.850
I think you're a really
good writer,

57:14.880 --> 57:15.950
it's--

57:15.980 --> 57:17.520
Go on, I can
take it.

57:18.590 --> 57:20.550
Look, I only read two
of your books.

57:20.590 --> 57:22.990
It kind of feels like you're
saying the same thing

57:23.020 --> 57:24.060
just in different ways.

57:24.090 --> 57:25.260
I know, I know.

57:25.290 --> 57:28.590
I've been saying it
since my twenties.

57:28.630 --> 57:31.860
You know that quote, 'it
takes courage to grow up

57:31.900 --> 57:33.830
and be who you
really are'?

57:33.870 --> 57:37.270
No, I don't think that's a real
quote but I like how it sounds.

57:37.340 --> 57:42.010
Okay, well, maybe it's time for
me to admit that I'm growing up.

57:43.980 --> 57:47.210
Maybe you should write
about that in your books.

57:47.250 --> 57:49.010
I'm still putting the
pieces together,

57:49.380 --> 57:50.780
but you know what?

57:50.820 --> 57:52.250
I think they're falling
into place.

57:52.290 --> 57:52.880
Yeah?

57:52.920 --> 57:53.520
Yeah.

58:05.470 --> 58:06.660
<i> ♪</i> It was lots of fun.

58:06.700 --> 58:08.870
I'm glad you taught me
all those cool moves.

58:08.900 --> 58:09.700
You're welcome.

58:09.740 --> 58:11.840
I love spinning
on skates.

58:11.870 --> 58:13.270
Hey, go get
ready for bed.

58:13.310 --> 58:15.040
I'll be up there
in a minute.

58:15.080 --> 58:15.740
Come on, Chelsea.

58:15.780 --> 58:16.470
Goodnight, you guys.

58:16.510 --> 58:17.080
Goodnight, April.

58:17.140 --> 58:18.340
Bye.

58:19.180 --> 58:20.550
Let me walk
you home.

58:20.580 --> 58:22.650
It's a rough neighborhood
out there.

58:22.680 --> 58:24.350
Okay.

58:25.590 --> 58:27.550
Gosh, how can you deny
that Christmas

58:27.590 --> 58:30.560
is just the best
time of year?

58:30.590 --> 58:35.190
The air so cool and crisp, you
can smell the fireplaces,

58:35.260 --> 58:37.100
the stars are twinkling
in the sky,

58:37.130 --> 58:41.270
and all of these lights,
it's just so magical.

58:42.570 --> 58:45.340
I can't deny that it's
pretty, and charming,

58:45.370 --> 58:49.840
and all that other stuff,
but it reminds me

58:49.880 --> 58:52.480
of something I'd rather
not remember.

58:53.550 --> 58:56.010
That person that
I remind you of?

58:56.350 --> 58:59.950
Well, only in the sense that she
was all about Christmas too.

59:01.790 --> 59:04.090
So, one year I decided
to give her

59:04.120 --> 59:06.220
the ultimate Christmas
present,

59:07.030 --> 59:10.530
I proposed on Christmas
Eve, ring and all.

59:12.030 --> 59:14.430
What I didn't know

59:14.470 --> 59:17.070
was that she had fallen in
love with someone else.

59:20.810 --> 59:23.140
I can see why you'd
want to forget that.

59:23.980 --> 59:26.880
Now you know the real reason
I don't do Christmas.

59:26.910 --> 59:29.450
Or have much fondness
for women who do.

59:29.480 --> 59:31.950
That's not exactly true...

59:32.220 --> 59:33.750
anymore.

59:36.790 --> 59:39.090
Well, I'm glad
to hear that.

59:39.890 --> 59:42.560
And a lot of that's
your fault.

59:43.360 --> 59:46.460
Well, I take full
responsibility.

59:46.500 --> 59:47.670
<i>Uncle Eric.</i>

59:48.670 --> 59:49.530
I should--

59:49.570 --> 59:50.440
You should--

59:50.500 --> 59:51.570
Probably get those
kids to bed.

59:51.640 --> 59:53.640
Yeah, uh-huh.

59:55.140 --> 59:56.110
Well, goodnight.

59:56.180 --> 59:57.610
Night.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:02.510
Hey, umm--

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.550
I'm really glad that you came
ice skating with us tonight.

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:07.220
It was a lot
of fun.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.020
Yes, it was.

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:21.730
Flick him again!

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:26.570
Are you awake,
Uncle Eric?

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:28.840
I am now.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.640
Okay, come on!

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.110
Get up!

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:30.940
Come on!

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.040
We got something
to show you.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:32.510
What?

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:32.880
Hurry up!

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:33.240
Come on!

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.980
Just come!

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:36.980
Okay, come on,
come on!

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.250
Come on!

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:39.450
Ready?

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:41.150
You're gonna love it.

01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:46.890
Unbelievable!

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:48.930
You two get ready
for breakfast.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.400
I'll be right in.

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.310
What's the use?

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.750
Hi, this is April Stuart
and I am calling

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:24.320
to confirm my four o' clock
audition for today.

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:27.930
Yeah, thank you.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:34.370
Nick, I had an amazing
break through yesterday

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.570
and I worked
all night.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.970
But I gotta warn you,
I kind of went off

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.940
in a different direction.

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:39.900
<i> How different?</i>

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.170
Look, just read it.

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:43.510
Okay, I'm gonna send you
the pages in a few minutes

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.040
and we'll talk later.

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.510
Hey guys, breakfast
is ready.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.530
Adding some new
decorations?

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:09.700
No, I'm just moving
things around.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.500
My audition is this
afternoon,

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:15.140
so I'm just trying to keep
myself distracted.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.910
Well, I have no doubt
that you will crush it.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.340
What piece are you
gonna play?

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:22.250
I haven't
decided yet.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.380
Well, if I were you I'd play
that Christmas one

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.650
you've been practicing.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.350
I mean, look around.

01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:30.560
It's you.

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.290
True.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:35.530
But I just don't think it's the
best piece for an audition.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.830
But it's a great piece, and
it shows who you are.

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:41.370
And isn't that what you want
the orchestra to see?

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.070
Oh, uhh, I almost
forgot...

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:47.540
I wanted to return
your plate.

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:48.870
Oh, thank you.

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:51.140
And let you know that I
stayed up all night writing.

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:54.950
After we spoke, it dawned on
me, if I don't believe

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.650
what I'm writing, my
readers won't either.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.150
And, having Chelsea
and Liam around,

01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:03.020
it kinda put things
in perspective.

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.390
And then the words just
started pouring out of me.

01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:09.590
Wow.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.860
Well, I mean, maybe it
was the cookies?

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.870
They definitely
didn't hurt.

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.070
But seriously, you were
the inspiration.

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:23.440
Wow.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.410
Well, hopefully I've inspired
my students too.

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:28.010
Tonight's the big test.

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.280
Tonight?

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.050
It's the neighborhood
Christmas caroling.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.480
Ahh.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.920
Maybe you'll join us?

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.560
Ooh, no.

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:38.790
Come on!

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:39.620
No.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.660
It'll be fun.

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:42.430
You don't want me
to join you.

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:33.380
Okay.

01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.080
Hey guys, we gotta go
and see my agent.

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:51.200
<i> Thanks for coming in.</i>

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:53.430
<i> I felt we needed to talk</i>
<i> this out in person.</i>

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:54.800
That doesn't
sound good.

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:56.200
No, no.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.100
Not at all.

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:00.670
C'mon Nick, we've known
each other for too long.

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:02.170
You hated the pages,
didn't you?

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:05.580
I don't hate them, but this
isn't what the publisher bought,

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:06.510
that worries me.

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:07.950
Look, I know
it's different.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.580
This is not just
different.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.520
This is a whole new
genre for you.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:14.020
Can't that be a
good thing?

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:16.150
<i> It can also be a</i>
<i> dangerous thing.</i>

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.920
We're gambling with your
career here if we turn these in.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:25.830
Well, that's a gamble
I'm willing to take.

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:32.440
Merry Christmas, Nick.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.240
What no gift card?

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:50.860
Hey.

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:52.020
Hey.

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:55.190
Your house is beginning to
look a lot like Christmas.

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:56.530
I like it.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.600
Well, I figured if you
can't beat 'em,

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:01.100
you might as
well join 'em.

01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:01.730
Well, welcome.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.970
Thanks.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.970
Hey guys.

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:09.610
You're joining us?

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.140
Any objections?

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:15.750
I'm just surprised,
that's all.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.280
Listen, Conrad...

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.990
I think I owe you an apology for
being such a Scrooge.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.430
If you don't mind, I'd like to
offer a little advice

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.130
on your Christmas
décor...

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:38.140
Let's not push it.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.310
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:43.810
Welcome, everybody.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.940
It is so exciting to have
you here once again.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.680
And if everyone's
ready, let's go out

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:50.110
and spread some
Christmas cheer.

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.320
Woo!

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:57.460
♪ Joy to the world The
Lord has come ♪

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:02.430

Be careful with
that, it's hot.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:36.689
Thank you.

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:37.529
This is really good.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.960
Yeah, aren't they?

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.100
Great job, you guys!

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.300
Hey.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.470
Hey.

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:50.270
So, I know it's not
exactly a jazz concert,

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:53.710
but uhh, you seemed to be
enjoying yourself out there.

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:54.510
I did.

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:55.580
Mhm.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.710
The neighborhood does
this every year?

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:57.520
Mhm.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.149
Every December 22nd.

01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:00.680
For the past
27 years.

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:03.120
But the live accompaniment
just started a few years ago

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.520
when I moved here.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.390
Wow, we are lucky
to have you.

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:09.560
And so would
any orchestra.

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:11.330
How'd the
audition go?

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.899
Pretty good, yeah.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:16.470
I used method number four
and uhh, no hiccups.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.270
Nice.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.840
They said we'll hear by
the end of the month.

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:24.479
So, I'm just trying to keep
my mind off of it.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.810
I promised the kids we'd
watch a movie tonight.

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:29.109
Why don't you
join us?

01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:31.850
Maybe that would help you
keep your mind off of it.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.479
You're not writing tonight?

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.590
I am also trying to
stay preoccupied.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.120
I turned in my
new pages,

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.490
I'm waiting to hear back
from my new publisher.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.990
Maybe we can uhh, stay
distracted together?

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.800
I'll bring the popcorn?

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:47.830
One thing you should
know about me,

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:51.240
I am a master
popcorn popper.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.340
Oh, and I thought I knew
everything about you

01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:54.370
from your books.

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:55.770
Well, don't you know
you shouldn't judge

01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:56.970
a book by
it's cover?

01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:58.680
Or the author.

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:00.440
We'll see.

01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:07.250
You like that falsetto?

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:07.920
I did!

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:08.590
That wasn't intentional.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.490
I definitely think you have
a career in singing.

01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:17.390
You were impressed.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:19.160
I was, I was very
impressed.

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:20.460
I'll keep surprising you.

01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:22.130
I definitely was.

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:28.640
Umm, we should probably do
a rain check on that movie.

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:29.840
Yeah.

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:31.210
I'll see you later.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:38.580
I wasn't expecting you.

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:42.520
Yeah, I know, I was umm, just
about to leave you a note.

01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:45.620
I'm sorry about
the other night.

01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:47.060
Don't be.

01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:49.530
You were being honest.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.160
Blunt would be
more accurate.

01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:54.770
And I realized we left
things unresolved,

01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:57.270
so I just wanted to
clear the air

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.100
and say I don't think we
should keep dating.

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.440
I think you're right.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.110
Then there's no
hard feelings.

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.560
Merry Christmas, Bridget.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.500
Merry Christmas, Eric.

01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:36.340
Thank you so much April, I know
I keep asking you to watch

01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:38.680
the kids, but when my
agent calls and says

01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:41.580
it's important I kind of gotta
go and besides, if I bring

01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:45.480
the kids one more time, Nick's
liable to sign them as clients.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.550
I'm happy to help.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.090
Besides, the best
part about Christmas

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.020
is wrapping presents,
right guys?

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.560
I like getting
them better.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:52.690
Listen to this guy.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.890
Get in the house.

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:02.700
Hey uhh, sorry about the
interruption last night.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.970
If you're available,

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.370
would you be up for giving
it another try tonight?

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.680
I mean that is, if you're
free of course.

01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:14.180
I'm sorry, I'm working
tonight.

01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:15.650
Oh.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.380
Okay.

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.410
Good luck.

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:21.720
Thanks, I think I just
might need it.

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:28.790
I'm glad you're sitting down,
because the publishers--

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.730
Loved your pages!

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:36.870
In fact, they wanna sign
you to two sequels.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:37.600
What?

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.200
A-are you serious?

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.700
Boom-shacka-lacka!

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.370
I don't even know
what to say.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.580
How about you were right
and I was wrong?

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:47.210
Well, I'm not one to throw
things back in someone's face.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.450
No, no, I
deserve it.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.650
Especially this time.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.380
You were right on with
the new direction.

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.320
They think this is
gonna be huge.

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:55.850
We can't use
the old title,

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:58.990
so they want to know
what you gon' call it.

01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:02.360
How
Christmas heals the heart.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.390
Sounds like a winner.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.160
Right?

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:04.930
I need a copy,
baby.

01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:09.770
Wow!

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.040
You just pull it and then you
get the big release.

01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:16.240
That's so cool.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.540
Umm, I don't think
this one is ours.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.310
It's probably for
your Grandma.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.150
No, Uncle Eric bought
Grandma a watch.

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.620
We wrapped it
yesterday.

01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:28.820
Then who's this for?

01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:31.320
It's probably
for Bridget.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.630
We'll let Uncle Eric wrap
that one himself.

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:42.470
Hey mom, how's my favorite
lady feeling today?

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.440
<i> Better, but I'm still</i>
<i> a little weak.</i>

01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:46.770
<i> Doctor wants me to stay</i>
<i> in one more day.</i>

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.110
That's terrific!

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.810
<i> You sound awfully happy.</i>

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.410
I got some great news from
my publisher today.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.550
They loved my book.

01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:57.210
Oh honey, I'm so
proud of you!

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:59.880
And if this doesn't prove you
don't have a Christmas jinx,

01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:01.820
I don't know
what will.

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:02.550
Oh.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.090
Eric, I-I have to go
lie down.

01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:08.530
I'm feeling a little
tired just now.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.760
Bye.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.000
I'll be back in
a minute.

01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:14.600
I'll see you at
the house.

01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:17.200
That's really great
news, Eric.

01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:18.400
Congratulations!

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.770
Hey, how about I open a
bottle of champagne

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:23.910
and we celebrate tonight when
you get back from work?

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:27.710
I usually get off pretty
late and I'm tired so...

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.850
Okay, well, how about a
rain check?

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.650
I don't think so.

01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:36.220
Is something wrong?

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:40.290
I just, I don't think
it's a good idea.

01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:44.130
Look, I have a student coming
in a few minutes and I--

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.900
Congratulations again.

01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:57.610
Wake up, sleepy heads.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.910
Up, up, up!

01:14:58.940 --> 01:14:59.510
Come on.

01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:00.580
Five more minutes.

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:02.480
Is it Christmas already?

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.580
Not until tomorrow but I
have a surprise for you.

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:07.990
Come on, getup!

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.050
Gotta get dressed.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.120
Let's go!

01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:16.060
I know you guys are
disappointed

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:17.790
your Mom and Dad
aren't back yet,

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:20.760
so I thought maybe we could
start a tradition of our own.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.970
Just the three of us.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.400
Go on, go get
your skates.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.800
I'll meet you
over there.

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.640
Hey, man.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.570
Glad you made it.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.810
Thanks, where
are your kids?

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:34.410
They're already
on the ice.

01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:37.920
So uhh, how is Santa and
his reindeer doing?

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:41.050
What are you
talking about?

01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:43.250
Your front lawn.

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:45.090
That was you!

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.190
Wait, you didn't
figure it out?

01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:49.730
Obviously not.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.230
It's a good thing you're
not a mystery writer.

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:57.870
We should put that
one on the tree.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.800
Yeah.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.270
Looks pretty good,
doesn't it?

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.240
That's a lot of
turkey for just us.

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:03.710
Left overs are
the best part.

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.140
I don't care if it's just
the three of us.

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.850
We are gonna have a
Christmas Eve to remember.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.580
Can we invite April?

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:13.720
I thought about that, but I know
she's working tonight.

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:16.290
And besides, I think she
might be mad at me.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.420
What for?

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:18.690
I wish I knew.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.460
Do you think it's about
that necklace?

01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:21.460
What necklace?

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.930
The one you bought
for Bridget.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.730
I didn't buy Bridget
a necklace.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.060
Well, April said
you did.

01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:28.500
It was in the bag of presents
we were wrapping.

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:30.430
She said you should
wrap it yourself.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.870
Now it makes sense.

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.370
It does?

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:37.240
Yeah, I'll explain it to
you in a few years.

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.520
Sorry April, we
need to talk.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.060
Hey, how was
last night?

01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:55.330
How did it go?

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.590
It didn't.

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:58.200
What do you mean?

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:01.030
His girlfriend was there waiting
for him when we got home.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.470
I'm so sorry, April.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.040
It'll be okay.

01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:46.610
Uncle Eric, this is
uhh, kinda lumpy.

01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:50.480
Who could that be?

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.920
Maybe it's Santa.

01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:55.620
It's way too early,
Uncle Eric.

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:57.420
You're too smart for
your own good.

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:01.390
Surprise!

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:01.960
You're back!

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.960
We made it!

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:03.630
Hey!

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:04.590
Hey you!

01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:05.900
Smells like turkey
in here.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.100
Yeah!

01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:13.200
So nice to
see you!

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.080
<i>We decorated</i>
<i> it ourselves!</i>

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.380
Wow!

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.720
Did you really?

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:29.320
How long did
that take you?

01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:31.050
A long time.

01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:34.520
Mom, should you be out
in your condition?

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.230
Oh, about that...

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.800
I missed you
so much!

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:41.730
Let me see you, let
me see you.

01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:43.900
I was never
actually sick,

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:45.840
I kind of lied about
having the flu.

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:48.770
Well, if you wanted to get
rid of the kids that badly,

01:18:48.810 --> 01:18:50.710
you could have just been
honest with me.

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.640
Actually, you were the kid
I wanted to get rid of.

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:55.650
I just thought that if
you were forced

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.680
to take on some responsibility
you'd grow

01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:00.720
and you know, let
go of the past.

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:03.590
And you know what sweetheart,
from what I've seen this week,

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.590
I think it worked.

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.560
Now, I hope you're
too mad at me,

01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:08.590
huh?

01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:09.730
Huh?

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.500
I started to feel guilty
around day three.

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:15.800
I'm not mad.

01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:17.270
I get why you
did it...

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.270
but maybe you should be
the writer in the family...

01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:21.470
Definitely fiction.

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.510
Oh wow, look
at that tree!

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:26.810
Yeah!

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.750
You know, that is the largest
tree I've ever seen

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.010
in anyone's house.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.120
I thought it was like the
ones you get every year.

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:33.580
<i> What?</i>

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.520
<i> No.</i>

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:40.560
<i>Honey, this turkey is</i>
<i> absolutely delicious.</i>

01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:42.260
<i> I basted the turkey</i>
<i> for an hour.</i>

01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:44.460
<i> Where did you learn</i>
<i> how to cook like this?</i>

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:47.300
I wrote a book, which you
obviously didn't read.

01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:48.670
Has anyone read
my book!?

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:51.000
Has anyone read my recipe
book, I really wanna know!

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.140
Honey, honey tell
us about your trip.

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:56.740
We spent the last 24 hours
flying home by way of Moscow,

01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:58.180
Brussels, and London.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.780
But hey, at least we made it
back for Christmas, right?

01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:04.210
And you two really came
through for us, thank you.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.450
We were happy to help,
weren't we mom?

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.590
Looks like Uncle Eric
kept you two busy.

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:12.520
It was more like they
kept me busy.

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.160
Yeah, and we haven't even tell
you about the ice skating

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:16.630
and the Christmas
caroling with April.

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.060
Yeah, that was
so much fun...

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:22.970
Okay so someone needs to fill us
in and let us know who April is.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.200
I thought the last girl you were
dating was named Bridget.

01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:28.940
Well, the word 'was' pretty much
sums up that relationship.

01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:32.480
Okay, I'm a little confused
here, as to who April is.

01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:35.550
She lives two doors down, she
was great with Liam and Chelsea.

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.010
<i> Wasn't she, guys?</i>

01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:38.680
So, why isn't she
here tonight?

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:41.420
Because she doesn't seem to
be talking to me right now.

01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:44.620
Sounds like more than
just a neighbor to me.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.860
Yeah well, I was kinda hoping
that would be the case,

01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:49.890
but I guess I blew
it somehow.

01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:51.930
Okay Romeo, so if she
lives next door,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.630
why don't you just go over
and tell her how you feel?

01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:57.270
Cause she's not home.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.300
But I know
where she is.

01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:04.410
What am I doing?

01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:08.280
I'm sorry, guys.

01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:09.580
I-I gotta go!

01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:10.780
Thanks for the
advice, sis.

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.580
What?

01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:27.030
We need to talk.

01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:28.300
I can't, I'm working.

01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:30.430
I'm not going anywhere
until you listen to me.

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.140
There's nothing to say.

01:21:32.170 --> 01:21:36.670
You have a girlfriend, I misread
the signals, no harm done.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.640
You didn't misread
any signals.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.380
<i> Bridget and I are</i>
<i> not a couple.</i>

01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:42.380
She just came over last
night to apologize,

01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:44.380
and we wished
each other well.

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:47.080
<i> And, about that</i>
<i> necklace you saw...</i>

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.920
I bought it for you,
no one else.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.090
I told you the first
time I saw it,

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.130
it was meant
for you.

01:21:57.630 --> 01:21:59.360
And maybe I
am too...

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.400
maybe we're meant
for each other.

01:22:09.610 --> 01:22:12.840
And you don't even write
romance novels.

01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:14.240
I'd rather live one.

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:26.560
How's that for a
happy ending?

01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:28.960
Well, it's not
over yet.

01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:31.430
I heard from the
orchestra, I'm in!

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.000
Yes!

01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:39.070
By the way, what are you
doing New Years Eve?

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.210
You mind if I steal
April tonight?

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.040
You two get out
of here!

01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:47.780
Bye!

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.850
