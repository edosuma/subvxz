00:06.600 --> 00:11.133
OK, guess who
is crushing big time?

00:11.133 --> 00:12.767
Aw, Miley, not again.

00:12.767 --> 00:16.000
Even Jeff Gordon makes a pit
stop every once in a while.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.300
I am not talking about me.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.300
Although, uh, tall, dark
and yummy over there

00:21.300 --> 00:23.100
is definitely on my radar.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.600
- Miley.
- Right.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.567
Anyhoo, I'm talking
about Oliver.

00:30.567 --> 00:33.600
- He is in love.
- Are you sure?

00:33.600 --> 00:35.100
I was just in
the girl's bathroom

00:35.100 --> 00:39.200
and there was nobody sobbing,
"Why me, why me?"

00:39.200 --> 00:40.700
I'm sure.

00:40.700 --> 00:44.200
I saw him upstairs and he was
totally distracted and spacy.

00:46.500 --> 00:50.000
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:53.000 --> 00:56.900
I guess you're right. That's
love. Painful, painful love.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.600
Hey, how's it going?

00:59.600 --> 01:03.100
Nice kicks, Timmy.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.033
Spill it, Oliver.
Who is she?

01:05.033 --> 01:06.400
Who's who?

01:06.400 --> 01:11.200
The girl you've fallen for...
all the way down the stairs.

01:12.834 --> 01:14.200
- There's no girl.
- Oh, really?

01:14.200 --> 01:17.367
Then, uh, how do you explain
this box of chocolates?

01:18.567 --> 01:21.400
All right, fine.
They're for a girl.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.800
- What's her name?
- She's not even in our grade.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.233
- You don't know her.
- [scoffing]

want to tell us.
- Yeah.

Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

- Come on.
- Tell us.

Guys, I really...

- Come on.
- Tell us.

Just leave me alone, OK?

01:41.767 --> 01:43.567
[both meowing]

01:43.567 --> 01:46.233
- I've never seen him like this.
- I know.

01:46.233 --> 01:48.600
Maybe we should
respect his privacy.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.100
Yeah.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.867
Although, if we respect it
too long,

01:52.867 --> 01:54.000
we'll lose his trail.
Come on.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.367
[chuckling]
Aw. Thank you, Oliver.

02:07.767 --> 02:11.000
The ones with the little
squigglies on top are the best.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.867
I'm going to take
AP English.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.367
I'm going to take
AP Water Polo.

02:23.367 --> 02:25.500
Good night, nurse!

02:25.500 --> 02:27.500
Oliver is crushing
on someone old enough

on Monsieur Garneau,

"Tinkles Truscott."

Yeah! She's had a ton
of boyfriends since then!

04:19.100 --> 04:22.300
OK, fine, two.
And Lucas cheated on her,
so that doesn't really count.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.000
And the other one she
took to court, but if you...

04:24.000 --> 04:25.100
Stop helping me!

We can't make fun of Oliver.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.200
For this. Everything
else is fair game, right?

04:32.200 --> 04:36.700
Of course. Now we just
got to protect him from
the trash-talking twins.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.100
- How?
- Simple.

04:39.100 --> 04:43.700
We get him nursing on a new
crush, not crushing on an old
nurse.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.600
- Another good one I can't use.
- Come on.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.500
Ma, you may want
to sit down for this one.

04:54.500 --> 05:00.500
- Jackson, your grandson,
got a "B."
-<i>[screaming over phone]</i>

I told you, you may
want to sit down.

05:03.300 --> 05:07.000
Yep, and it's all because
of this new girlfriend he's got.

I'll tell you what,
she is smart as a whip,

05:09.300 --> 05:12.233

an influence she's been on him.

I got to go.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.700
If you can't get up,
call me back.

05:17.700 --> 05:22.867
There he is! My "B" boy
and his "A"-plus lady.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.700
- Dad.
- Hi, Mr. Stewart.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.700
Little lady, from now on you
can just call me, "Happy Pappy!"

05:29.000 --> 05:32.834
He's not really my dad.
I was left on his doorstep.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.133
By a wizard.

05:36.133 --> 05:37.967
Aw, son. Come on, now.

05:37.967 --> 05:40.667
I didn't mean to embarrass you,
but look at this!

05:40.667 --> 05:42.500
You made the refrigerator!

05:43.500 --> 05:45.400

05:45.400 --> 05:48.100
Just got a little dust
in my eye, that's all.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.500
Wow, what'll he do when he
finds out about your "A"
on the History quiz?

05:51.500 --> 05:54.767
Oh. That's a risk I can't take.

05:56.767 --> 06:02.000
OK, I'm just going to go for
a jog now and leave you two
to your...

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000

I don't know.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.300
He's cute, but I'm just
not feeling it anymore.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.667
I was gonna break
up with him today.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.300
[mouthing] No.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.734
But I just can't.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.967
I'll wait until
after the test tomorrow.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.367
[sobbing]

06:37.367 --> 06:39.000
Pull it together, old man.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.300
It's not like it's
the last "B" I'll ever get.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.734
Hey, what about Stephanie?
She's cute.

06:58.734 --> 07:01.400
And on last year's field trip
she sat in front of Oliver.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.233
Oh, yeah.

07:03.233 --> 07:05.934
He scarfed down three hot dogs
before they got on the bus...

07:05.934 --> 07:09.133
...and she was wearing
them when they got off.

07:10.767 --> 07:14.600
No problem. I'm sure there's,
uh, plenty of girls for Oliver.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.467
Yeah. Well, let's see.

07:16.467 --> 07:22.300
Tripped her, sat on her lunch,
spilled on, spilled on.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.600

07:23.600 --> 07:25.834
And poor Pamela...

...the only survivor of the Oken
natural gas disaster of 2006.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.467
[groans] This may be harder
than we thought.

07:36.500 --> 07:41.367
Oh, no. There she is. Sweet old
lady doesn't suspect a thing.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.200
Loverboy's at it again.
Let's go.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.767
Hey, guys. What's up?

08:02.767 --> 08:05.400
Oh, Miley, did you get
hit by a football again?

08:06.300 --> 08:08.100
- No.
- Soccer ball?

08:08.100 --> 08:09.934
- No.
- Boomerang?

08:09.934 --> 08:13.133
No! I'm fine.
This isn't about me.

08:13.133 --> 08:18.934
It's about Oliver and you and
the chocolates and that note.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.200
- So, you know?
- Yeah.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.667
- Oh, I am so glad he told you.
- You are?

08:27.667 --> 08:33.367
Absolutely. He wanted this
to be, uh, our little secret.

08:33.367 --> 08:36.300
But I told him there
was nothing to be ashamed of.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.300
You did?

08:38.300 --> 08:41.667
Of course. Oliver didn't
ask for this to happen.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.100
I mean, none of us ever do.

08:44.100 --> 08:47.133
But when it does,
you can either run away from it

08:47.133 --> 08:48.567
or you can embrace it.

08:48.567 --> 08:51.200
And you want him
to embrace it?

08:52.467 --> 08:53.734
Oh, I've begged him to.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.300
And now that he has,
I couldn't be happier.

08:56.300 --> 08:59.033
You're kidding me, right?

08:59.033 --> 09:02.100
Why would I kid about
Oliver having diabetes?

09:02.100 --> 09:04.100
[together] What?

09:08.867 --> 09:10.767
Oliver has diabetes?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.700
Of course. What did you
think I was talking about?

09:12.700 --> 09:14.133
Diabetes.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.734
Oliver has diabetes.

09:16.734 --> 09:18.400
She meant to say it
with a period,

09:18.400 --> 09:21.367
but she said it with
a question mark by mistake.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.834
- Right, Lilly?
- Uh. Oh, yeah.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.200
- It's a teenage girl thing?
- We all do it?

09:26.200 --> 09:27.500
My mom hates it?

09:28.767 --> 09:30.734
Wait a minute,
you didn't think that Oliver...

09:30.734 --> 09:33.100
- [together] No!
- Because I would never...

09:33.100 --> 09:35.500
- [together] Of course not!
- I mean, Oliver?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.000
[together] We know.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.600
I mean, let's face it,

09:39.600 --> 09:42.000
you still have
a couple of good years left.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.500
- You could do a lot better.
- Gee, thanks.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.500
Poor Oliver.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.400
I know. I just want
to give him a big hug.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.567
Oh, this is why he gave her
the chocolates,

09:54.567 --> 09:56.700
so he wouldn't eat them.
When you have diabetes,

09:56.700 --> 09:58.400
you're not supposed
to have a lot of sugar.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.033
Wait a minute.
You guys didn't know, did you?

10:02.033 --> 10:02.934
[both inhaling]

10:02.934 --> 10:05.200
- Uh-uh.
- No.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.967
Oh, boy. OK, listen.

10:07.967 --> 10:10.000
You can live a very
full life with diabetes,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.033
but this is still
all very new to Oliver

10:12.033 --> 10:13.233
and he's struggling with it.

10:13.233 --> 10:15.567
So, please,
let him tell you. OK?

10:15.567 --> 10:19.600
- But, what if he doesn't?
- Yeah, we're his friends.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.934
I mean, we want to help him.

10:21.934 --> 10:24.033
So you're just gonna
have to be patient, OK?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.300
OK. We can do that.

10:31.967 --> 10:34.033
We can't do this!

10:34.033 --> 10:36.900
<i>♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah ♪</i>

10:36.900 --> 10:40.600
It says here that Oliver's body
just doesn't process sugar

10:40.600 --> 10:43.200
the way it's supposed to.
But if he takes his insulin

10:43.200 --> 10:48.233
and doesn't eat too many sweets,
he can lead a normal life.

10:48.233 --> 10:51.934
I do not know why he
is so afraid to tell us.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.834
I could totally help him
stay away from sugar.

11:00.133 --> 11:04.000
I agree. You are quite
the little role model.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.900
That's not the point.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.000
I mean, he's gonna
tell us eventually.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.500
- What's he waiting for?
- I can't imagine.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.000
It's not like you
didn't tell him

11:13.000 --> 11:15.400
you were Hannah Montana
right off the bat.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.800
I mean, you didn't keep him
waiting, and waiting,

11:18.800 --> 11:22.200
- and waiting, and waiting...
- I got the point,
Captain Subtle.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.000
Hey, I got a great idea.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.100
Why don't you take him
to Traci's party tonight?

11:28.100 --> 11:32.734
Hang out, have fun,
get his mind off things.

11:32.734 --> 11:36.033
That's actually a good idea.

11:36.033 --> 11:38.934
I do have those on occasion,
you know.

11:38.934 --> 11:42.100
It's not like I'm one
of those dopey TV dads.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.100
You keep telling yourself that,
big fella.

11:48.834 --> 11:52.967
Oh. My little B-boy.

11:52.967 --> 11:56.600
[sniffling]
I hardly knew you.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.567
OK. OK. So, what do you
call a pig who knows karate?

12:01.567 --> 12:03.467
A pork chop!
Hi-ya!

12:05.000 --> 12:07.934
Jackson! Allison!

12:07.934 --> 12:11.867
You're here!
Together! That's great!

12:11.867 --> 12:16.233
You are a beautiful couple.

12:16.233 --> 12:19.900
Don't worry, he always gets
like this just before nappy
time, huh?

12:19.900 --> 12:22.033
I'll be right back.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.000
Don't blow this for me!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.467
She said she wants
to "talk,"

12:27.467 --> 12:29.500
and I think we both know
what that means.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.400
- [clicks tongue]
- Well, one of us does.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.000
Look, I don't have time for
your riddles, old man. Just go.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.400
- Hey. Hey.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

12:53.934 --> 12:55.300
[screeching]

12:57.500 --> 13:00.934
I... am just, uh,
dancing over to you

13:00.934 --> 13:05.834
because I can't
wait to "talk."

13:05.834 --> 13:08.367
[smacking]
Ready when you are.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.867
Actually, I really did
want to talk.

13:10.867 --> 13:13.900
Really? OK.

13:13.900 --> 13:16.400
Well, I guess we could,
you know, start with that.

13:16.400 --> 13:21.400
- Listen, Jackson. I...
- Hey! Um, before I take my nap,

13:21.400 --> 13:23.500
I just wanted to say to you

13:23.500 --> 13:30.033
that you are the best girlfriend
Jackson has ever had. Ever.

13:30.033 --> 13:31.233
And he's had a lot of them.

13:31.233 --> 13:34.400
I cannot keep the ladies off
of this one.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.700
Dad, we're trying to have
a little conversation here.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.900
Conversation?
Oh, you don't want to do that.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.767
Talking's the quickest way
to ruin a relationship.

13:43.767 --> 13:46.500
Hey, let me ask you,
have you kissed him yet?

13:46.500 --> 13:50.900
All the ladies say
he's got lips like butter.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.800
- Dad!
- Oh, son, don't be modest.

13:54.800 --> 14:00.567
You know, Stewart men only
get better-looking with age.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.767
Exhibit A.

14:02.767 --> 14:04.567
- Could you excuse us? OK.
- OK.

14:04.567 --> 14:08.100
Did I happen to mention he's
gonna inherit a lot of money?

14:09.367 --> 14:10.967
What are you doing?

14:10.967 --> 14:13.000
I'm trying to get you
into college.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.200
How? By humiliating me?

14:15.200 --> 14:17.233
By saving this relationship.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.200
I heard her on
the phone yesterday.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.700
She's gonna
break up with you.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.467
Whah?

14:24.400 --> 14:26.967
Sorry, son.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.033
Is that true?
You want to break up with me?

14:30.033 --> 14:32.767
[inhaling] Yeah.

14:33.934 --> 14:36.934
And I didn't know
exactly how to say it.

14:36.934 --> 14:38.967
Thank you so much,
Mr. Stewart.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.700
[chuckles] Wow, that
was easier than I thought.

14:48.934 --> 14:53.500
[sniffling] It's just so unfair.
I did everything I could.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.667
What more did she want?

14:57.667 --> 15:00.133
Look, these things happen.

15:00.133 --> 15:04.000
How can you be
so OK with this?

15:04.000 --> 15:08.767
Well, I just found out that I'm
going to inherit a ton of money!

15:10.200 --> 15:13.000
And get even better-looking!

15:13.000 --> 15:17.667
And you said I needed college!
Yeah! [whooping]

15:21.233 --> 15:24.000
Oh, come on, guys.
It'll be fun.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.233
You guys, I don't know.
I've got a ton of homework.

15:26.233 --> 15:29.300
- Maybe I should just go home.
- Oliver, you are not thinking
clearly, OK?

15:29.300 --> 15:34.867
This is Traci's sweet sixteen.
There's gonna be a ton of
sweet sixteens.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.000
Know what I mean? Eh?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.100
What do you mean?

15:39.100 --> 15:42.900
There'll be a lot of cute girls.
Pretty girls.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.500
Better yet, girls that haven't
formed an opinion of you yet.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.767
Oh, and you know,
sometimes it's good

15:48.767 --> 15:50.400
to take a break from
things, you know,

15:50.400 --> 15:54.600
like homework or stuff that
might be weighing heavily
on your mind.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.934
Or lightly.

15:56.934 --> 16:00.066
You know, stuff that seems
heavy now, but with time

16:00.066 --> 16:01.867
and the support
of your great friends...

16:01.867 --> 16:04.200
- ...and a well-balanced diet...
- ...life can be
a wonderful thing!

16:04.200 --> 16:06.033
A wonderful,
wonderful thing!

16:06.033 --> 16:09.867
OK. I'm thinking your wigs
are on a little bit too tight.

16:09.867 --> 16:12.600
And you are right.
See, we need you.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.000
We are not stable.
Come on, let's go have fun!

16:15.000 --> 16:16.667
- Yeah!
- [sighing]

16:23.734 --> 16:27.000
Oh, my gosh,
look at all the cupcakes.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Uh, yeah, you really should
get that homework done.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.734
It's not gonna do itself.
Let's go.

16:30.734 --> 16:31.934
Hannah!

16:31.934 --> 16:34.400
Welcome to my sweet sixteen.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.467
Emphasis on the sweet.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.900
Yep, everything looks great
here. Happy B-day. Air kiss!

16:38.900 --> 16:42.200
- Gotta go, bye!
- But you just got here.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.600
Let's split the difference.
<i>Ciao, </i>Lola.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.400
- [mocking noise]
- No, see, we all gotta get
outta here

16:48.400 --> 16:51.500
'cause I have a headache,
he's got homework to do,
and she just can't stand ya.

16:52.734 --> 16:54.033
OK, it can wait.

16:54.033 --> 16:57.734
Like you said, life can be
a wonderful, wonderful thing.

16:58.967 --> 17:00.867
Hello there,
wonderful thing.

17:01.867 --> 17:04.567
So it's settled!
You're staying!

17:04.567 --> 17:09.000
And, seriously, I have a driver
if you need a ride home.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.600
[mocking] And, seriously,
nobody here really thinks
you're sixteen.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.667
- [gasping]
- Yeah.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.500
Bye.

17:18.700 --> 17:22.734
Yeah, bring him along!
It'll be fun!

17:22.734 --> 17:26.000
- Thanks a lot, Dad.
- What are we supposed
to do now?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.500
Why does it always
have to be me?

17:27.500 --> 17:30.567
Don't you have an idea?
A suggestion?

17:30.567 --> 17:32.834
Something to get
the ball rolling? Yeesh!

17:32.834 --> 17:37.233
Hello! What do you want me
to do, eat every cupcake,

17:37.233 --> 17:39.734
cookie and brownie
before he does?

17:39.734 --> 17:42.367
- Finally, something useful!
- Yeah!

17:42.367 --> 17:45.867
Yeah! I had a good idea,
yes I did. Ooh, ooh!

17:45.867 --> 17:49.400
Getting a pet rat so at least
you look good next to something?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.734
Yeah, what size collar
do you wear?

17:51.734 --> 17:53.100
- [growling]
- [growling]

17:55.033 --> 17:57.934
Ooh, sweet things everywhere
I look, know what I mean?

17:57.934 --> 17:59.767
Oh, here you go.

17:59.767 --> 18:02.300
- Ooh! Thank you!
- Don't mind if I do!

18:02.300 --> 18:04.667
He's such a gentleman.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.467
What are you guys doing?

18:06.467 --> 18:09.934
- I'm just hungry.
- Really, really hungry.

18:15.667 --> 18:20.233
So I said to her, "Beyoncé,
in my book, you're A-yoncé."

18:20.233 --> 18:21.900
[chuckling] Right?

18:23.500 --> 18:25.900
- [grunting]
- What are you doing?

18:25.900 --> 18:28.734
- I love licorice. Hmm...
- Go get your own.

18:28.734 --> 18:31.834
- There's no more!
- She's got a whole tray
over there.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.600
They're like potato chips.
Can't have just one.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.233
Let's go!

18:38.233 --> 18:40.400
[scoffing] Celebrities.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.567
They think they're
entitled to everything.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.700
Wait! I don't know
where the food went.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.767
I got enough to feed a whale!

19:01.133 --> 19:03.133
Or two.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.367
Well, the good news is,

19:04.367 --> 19:06.967
we saved Oliver from all that...
[belches]

19:06.967 --> 19:11.467
...sugar. I never thought
I'd hate the taste of a brownie.

19:11.467 --> 19:16.500
[moaning] Hey, where is Oliver,
anyway? I can't see him.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.033
I can't see my belt.

19:20.934 --> 19:22.367
Where'd everybody go?

19:22.367 --> 19:24.100
- Party's...
- ...over.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.367
- Halle...
- ...lujah.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.900
Hey, you know, I never
even got anything to eat.

19:32.233 --> 19:34.667
[gasping] Finally.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.200
[together] No!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.300
[grunting]

19:44.934 --> 19:48.200
- What is wrong with you guys?
- We, uh...

19:48.200 --> 19:50.700
We really like cupcakes.

19:50.700 --> 19:53.100
And we know about your diabetes.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.233
You do?

19:55.233 --> 19:57.800
Yeah, the school nurse told us.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.700
And we couldn't just stand by
and let you eat that cupcake.

20:00.700 --> 20:05.867
Or this cupcake,
or this cupcake, or...

20:05.867 --> 20:08.200
...this pie.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.200
You guys think I can't eat this
stuff because I have diabetes?

20:13.200 --> 20:17.200
Well, yeah.
I mean, I think so.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.400
I didn't get to finish that
pamphlet because I got
ice cream all over it.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.400
- Shh! Don't say "ice cream"
in front of him.
- Sorry.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.100
Guys, I have Type 1 diabetes.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.100
Which means I can have stuff
with sugar in it.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.000
As long as I manage my diet,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.467
I monitor my blood sugar
with this...

20:32.467 --> 20:36.233
- [monitor beeps]
- Actually, according to this,
my blood sugar's low.

20:36.233 --> 20:40.934
Which means I actually need
something like a brownie...

20:40.934 --> 20:42.200
...if there were any left.

20:42.200 --> 20:46.033
Oh, wait, wait...

20:46.033 --> 20:48.100
Kept that warm for ya.

20:48.100 --> 20:51.400
Gee, thanks.

20:51.400 --> 20:56.934
Look, Oliver, I'm sorry,
but why didn't you tell us?

20:56.934 --> 20:58.500
I don't know.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.867
I didn't want you guys to look
at me like I was broken,

21:00.867 --> 21:04.900
- because I'm not.
- Well, we would have known
that if you'd have told us.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.867
Yeah, I know.
And I should have.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.867
And I guess I should have
rinsed off that pamphlet

21:10.867 --> 21:14.033
before we became
the food police.

21:16.033 --> 21:19.033
Hmm. It's chocolatey...

21:19.033 --> 21:21.967
...and it's got, like,
a hint of, uh...

21:21.967 --> 21:25.367
...pineapple? Mango?

21:25.367 --> 21:30.400
Uh, that's uh... that's my
"tropical mist" deodorant.

21:31.934 --> 21:34.000
Maybe we should just stop by a
smoothie place on the way home?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.100
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.033
Tonight, we learned
a lot of important things.

21:46.033 --> 21:51.000
Yeah. I learned that 40 kids get
diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes
every day.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And I learned you can't get it
from eating too many sweets.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.200
And I learned if you take your
insulin appropriately,

21:55.200 --> 21:58.133
exercise, and eat a balanced
diet, you can do anything

21:58.133 --> 21:59.967
and be anything you want to be.

21:59.967 --> 22:03.600
And I learned that someday,
I'm gonna be good-looking.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.100
And, I'm gonna inherit
a lot of money. Whoo-hoo!

22:07.100 --> 22:09.600
And I learned that
my brother's really annoying.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.000
Oh, wait, I already knew that.
