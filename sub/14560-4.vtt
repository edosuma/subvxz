WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:06.307
* When I'm walking
through town *

00:06.340 --> 00:08.709
* I got a gleam in my eye

00:08.742 --> 00:10.644
* My mama thinks it's kickin'

00:10.678 --> 00:12.646
* LJ swears that it's cool

00:12.680 --> 00:17.685
* There's a meadow in the forest
where we break all the rules *

00:17.718 --> 00:22.456
* Don't you know it's cool?
I got my songs on my TV *

00:23.791 --> 00:25.826
* Yeah

00:25.859 --> 00:29.263
* Got a wife, I got the kids,
I got the dog *

00:29.297 --> 00:32.300
* Won't you look at me?

00:32.333 --> 00:33.667
Mmovement, southwest corner

00:33.701 --> 00:35.136
of the house.

00:35.169 --> 00:38.439
MAN 2:
Team Alpha moving.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.342
MAN 3:
Team Delta moving.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.483
You guys move fast-- barely had
enough time to get ready.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.751
Yeah, westanding,where I'm

00:50.784 --> 00:51.785
this can't go fast enough.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.586
What's up, guys?

00:52.620 --> 00:55.323
Hey, look who it is!
What gives?

00:55.356 --> 00:56.690
Heard your team's
a man short.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.192
Yeah, newbie's got
anti-terror training.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.260
You filling in, huh?

00:59.293 --> 01:01.095
Well, if you guys
will have me.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.197
Okay, now, the FBI is gonna go
right in the front door.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.334
Secret Service, U.S. Marshals
have the side porches

01:06.367 --> 01:07.435
and the back door.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.502
LAPD,

01:08.536 --> 01:09.770
you're gonna be the perimeter.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.205
Looks like a bit
of overkill, no?

01:11.239 --> 01:12.673
This guy's just
a simple con man.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.275
Make no mistake, Agent Granger,

01:14.308 --> 01:16.210
there is nothing
simple about him.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.879
The FBI's been tracking
him for 26 months.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.349
I, myself, have been tracking
him for two years.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.318
If it's all right with you,
I'll call the shots.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.086
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:38.766 --> 01:40.134
Everybody ready?

01:40.168 --> 01:41.235
Standing by.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.336
BLOOM:
On my count.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.372
One, two, three...

01:44.405 --> 01:46.374
(door thuds open)
FBI! FBI!

01:46.407 --> 01:47.475
Move in!
Move in! Move in!

01:47.508 --> 01:49.777
Move! Move!

01:49.810 --> 01:51.545
We're clear!
Unit One, move in!

01:51.579 --> 01:52.780
Living room clear!

01:52.813 --> 01:54.815
Bottom floor clear!
-Go! Go! Go!

01:54.848 --> 01:55.816
AGENT 1:
Kitchen clear!

01:57.385 --> 01:58.452
AGENT 2:
Hallway clear!

01:58.486 --> 01:59.887
AGENT 3:
Bedroom clear!

01:59.920 --> 02:02.423
Where the hell is he?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.325
He's got to be somewhere.
We're going to find him.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.826
Perimeter,
you got anything?

02:05.859 --> 02:08.229
(over radio): Perimeter clear.
No one's exited.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.363
COLBY:
Don, take a look at this.

02:09.397 --> 02:10.864
A baby monitor.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.200
He saw us coming.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.634
DON:
Oh, yeah, check that out.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.236
Hey, I don't care
if he saw us coming.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.737
He was in when we hit.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.506
We're going to get him.
-All right.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.409
Nothing. Place is clean.
-Okay, so he's hiding.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.776
We've got to find him.

02:22.810 --> 02:23.811
There's a trapdoor
or something.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.413
You know what?
Everybody out.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.847
I know exactly what to do.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.182
First, we'll
bring in the dogs.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.317
And if that
doesn't work,

02:29.350 --> 02:30.818
we're just going
to rip this place apart.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.454
We're not going
to lose him this time.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.256
Everybody out.
Let's go.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.659
LARRY:
Charles, my little

02:38.692 --> 02:42.196
ambulatory reference book--
Chaitin's Omega Constant?

02:42.230 --> 02:45.799
Omega equals
.00787499699.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.967
What are you working on?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.001
Ooh, FBI file.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.504
Don asked me to take
a look at something. Hey!

02:50.538 --> 02:52.540
Don't be such a hard-ass.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.408
Look, as sympathetic
as I am to your plight,

02:54.442 --> 02:56.244
I'm not about to lose
my security clearance

02:56.277 --> 02:57.411
just to assuage
your curiosity.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.846
How long

02:58.879 --> 02:59.980
is this going to go on?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.583
I'm not talking about
your little Ricky and Lucy show.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.385
Charlie, the FBI?

03:04.418 --> 03:05.253
Shouldn't there be
a decision by now?

03:05.286 --> 03:08.322
Well, yeah, well,
McGowan still has

03:08.356 --> 03:10.358
to submit his
recommendation,

03:10.391 --> 03:12.460
and then I guess the ADIC's
going to make their decision.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.728
Not that your lack
of credentials

03:14.762 --> 03:16.330
has kept you
from working with Don.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.400
The "hard-ass" pejorative aside,
I hope you know

03:19.433 --> 03:21.469
we're all pulling for you,
and Don, of course.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.337
Thanks.
ALAN: Good grief.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.239
What is it, Dad?
(groans)

03:25.273 --> 03:27.575
The city has started a new
development down at Westmont.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.878
Look at this: theaters, shops,
apartment houses...

03:30.911 --> 03:32.813
Alan, when did you become
so anti-build?

03:32.846 --> 03:35.449
I'm not against development,
just not there.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.456
(indistinct radio transmission,
chatter)

03:44.392 --> 03:46.694
We had a secure perimeter.
He never exited.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.696
We'll get LAPD to put
the picture out wide.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.498
Well, that's the thing,
we don't have a picture.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.565
What do you mean?

03:51.599 --> 03:52.766
You said you've been after
the guy for two years.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.867
Well, that's how good he is,
Eppes-- there's no picture.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.370
There's no fingerprints on file.
He's got no record.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.805
Sounds like you're
chasing a ghost.

03:57.838 --> 04:01.309
Yeah, a ghost that took
$10 million from 14 companies.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.175
(Liz sighs)
-Anything?

04:02.209 --> 04:04.378
Nope, a lot of nasty stuff
up there,

04:04.412 --> 04:07.348
but none of it your target.
-Well, he just didn't disappear.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.949
You said this
guy's faked his way

04:08.982 --> 04:10.618
into a lot of jobs
before, right?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.486
He ever impersonate
a magician?

04:12.520 --> 04:16.023
Wait...
what about an agent?

04:16.056 --> 04:17.758
Brad, play that
video back for me.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.926
Yes, sir.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.861
How many agents went in?
-Uh, we, uh...

04:20.894 --> 04:22.029
five of ours,

04:22.062 --> 04:24.798
six marshals,
four Secret Service; 15.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.334
Okay, so how many come out?

04:26.367 --> 04:27.868
One, two,

04:27.901 --> 04:29.770
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

04:29.803 --> 04:31.939
nine, ten, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.006
Sixteen.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.442
Boom.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.877
Right there.
-Son of a bitch.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.079
Posed as an agent
and walked out with us.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.781
(slaps table)

04:54.061 --> 04:55.596
All right, so here he goes.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.730
He never turns.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.566
He never shows his face.

04:58.599 --> 04:59.900
There's just no way
to pull an ID from that.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.336
This is still all I've got.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.905
Early on, somebody called him
George Bailey, the name stuck.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.874
From, uh, It's a Wonderful Life?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.075
Everybody we interviewed said

05:08.108 --> 05:09.443
he's the nicest guy
in the whole world.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.744
I think his
greatest talent is

05:10.778 --> 05:13.781
that he can bluff his way
into any profession.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.016
He can be a school teacher,
a doctor,

05:16.049 --> 05:17.585
a salesman, a lawyer...

05:17.618 --> 05:21.822
He gets in, turns on the
charm, gains their trust.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.956
DON:
Which gives him access

05:22.990 --> 05:26.994
so he can get the files,
the accounts, the passwords...

05:27.027 --> 05:29.930
He steals modestly at first,
a thousand, $1,500.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.533
He disappears,
then he goes in again,

05:32.566 --> 05:33.601
hits the accounts,

05:33.634 --> 05:34.935
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.370
So the first
time's a trial run.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.506
He can test out
any of these passwords

05:38.539 --> 05:39.707
or PINs he's picked up.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.610
Waits till he's safely away
before making the big score.

05:42.643 --> 05:43.844
It's the same pattern we see

05:43.877 --> 05:45.479
with the Eastern European
syndicates.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.415
They have a single
guy on the inside,

05:47.448 --> 05:50.618
unlocks the accounts, and
then they wipe 'em clean.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.553
My bet is that this

05:52.586 --> 05:54.021
Mr. George Bailey
is just the tip

05:54.054 --> 05:56.524
of a much larger iceberg.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.860
Wait, hold on.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.429
Hey, McGowan, McGowan...

06:01.462 --> 06:03.531
Agent Eppes.
-What's going on? Come on.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.533
Agent Eppes, the
investigation is slow

06:05.566 --> 06:06.534
because I insist
on being thorough.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.502
All right, well, I mean,
can you at least tell me

06:08.536 --> 06:10.037
how long until
we get an answer?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.905
(sighs):
All right.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.574
You need an answer,
here it is.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.076
I'm recommending
disciplinary action against you

06:16.109 --> 06:18.078
for violations
in the cases

06:18.111 --> 06:19.513
of Crystal Hoyle
and Clay Porter.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.414
I'm also recommending

06:20.448 --> 06:21.715
against Professor Eppes

06:21.749 --> 06:23.451
getting his security
clearance back.

06:23.484 --> 06:27.821
You know, look,
I understand about me, but...

06:27.855 --> 06:29.557
Well, with Charlie,
you're just...

06:29.590 --> 06:30.724
you're hurting the Bureau.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.925
You and your brother
are the ones

06:31.959 --> 06:33.894
who tied your fortunes
together, not me.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.065
Besides, I already submitted
my recommendation.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.033
It's in the ADIC's hands now.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.074
This guy left in a hurry.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.076
Only the clothes on his back.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.812
Still there's not a single
personal item he left behind.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.947
It's kind of creepy.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.484
Maybe he's just
very careful.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.185
(sighs):
No.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.687
It's more than that.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.688
You and Colby, right,

07:00.721 --> 07:02.923
you guys are both
bachelors, you live alone.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.158
Either of your places
look like this?

07:05.192 --> 07:06.727
Little pillows, tchotchkes,

07:06.760 --> 07:09.963
all these pictures...
-"Tchotchkes"?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.632
You know what I'm saying.
-Yeah, you're saying

07:11.665 --> 07:15.202
the guy is creepy
for decorating his own house.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.738
No, it's generic,
like a catalog page.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.708
I mean, look at this.

07:20.741 --> 07:24.645
All these photos
came with the frames.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.615
It's like he was
trying to create a home,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.917
but didn't know how.
(car door closing)

07:29.950 --> 07:31.852
Neighbor.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.057
How are you
doing, ma'am?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.493
FBI. We, uh,
have some questions

07:39.527 --> 07:40.728
about the guy
that lives over here.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.896
Do you know him?
Not really.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.166
People up here tend to keep
to themselves.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.569
Okay. What about maybe people
coming and going?

07:48.602 --> 07:49.837
Have you ever seen anyone?

07:49.870 --> 07:52.606
His girlfriend was
out here two nights ago.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.473
They were arguing.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.576
How'd you know
it was his girlfriend?

07:55.609 --> 07:57.077
You could just tell, you know?

07:57.110 --> 07:58.245
What were they arguing about?

07:58.278 --> 07:59.580
I couldn't hear.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.782
I was watching
from inside.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.684
I thought you tend to keep
to yourselves up here?

08:03.717 --> 08:06.019
I've only been
in LA a couple of years.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.989
I'm still a little starstruck.
-What do you mean?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.558
Who's his girlfriend?

08:10.591 --> 08:11.692
Kelly Rand.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.161
She was briefcase
number 11.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.763
Now she's got a new TV show.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.568
Is he still not there?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.069
Nope.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.104
I left two messages.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.106
That's so unlike your dad.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.241
You worried?
-More curious

08:28.275 --> 08:29.910
than anything else,
'cause I can't understand

08:29.943 --> 08:31.178
what might have
bothered him so much

08:31.211 --> 08:32.179
about that building project.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.581
Hey,

08:33.614 --> 08:34.815
Charlie.
Hey.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.117
You got a second?

08:37.150 --> 08:38.218
There's been a decision.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.087
DON:
Not yet,

08:40.120 --> 08:42.623
but I know McGowan
recommended against us.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.892
AMITA:
It's just

08:44.925 --> 08:46.026
a recommendation though, right?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.294
The FBI doesn't have
to follow it.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.062
Yeah, they don't have to,
but they tend to.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.263
I'm sorry, man.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.165
Look, it's not your fault,
buddy.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.334
Clearly,
the guy is after me,

08:54.367 --> 08:56.770
and you're collateral damage.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.338
What are you going to do?
I mean...

08:58.371 --> 09:00.708
Something new.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.243
It's probably time.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.251
Actually, uh, we could use some
help on this in the meanwhile.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.923
Um, yeah, sure.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.360
Hi. We need to know
how to contact

09:20.393 --> 09:22.262
one of your clients,
Kelly Rand.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.097
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.298
I'm Kelly's manager.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.868
Maybe I should be
referring you

09:27.901 --> 09:29.870
to her attorney instead.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.873
We just want to talk
to her about a man

09:32.906 --> 09:34.241
she may be involved with.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.376
Well, Kelly is in New York
doing Regis today.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.611
But I think you may
have your information wrong.

09:37.645 --> 09:38.679
I'm sorry,

09:38.712 --> 09:40.948
but you don't even
know what our information is.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.015
That's true.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.018
But Kelly happens to be
"involved" as you put it,

09:45.052 --> 09:46.920
with someone here in the office.
-DAVID: Really?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.756
Who's that?
Ryan Goodwin.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.257
He's been with us
for a couple of weeks.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.660
He look anything like this guy?

09:54.227 --> 09:55.796
DAVID:
He's calling himself

09:55.829 --> 09:57.765
Ryan Goodwin.
Apparently, he set up a meeting

09:57.798 --> 10:00.333
with two of the partners a few
weeks ago; by the end of lunch,

10:00.367 --> 10:02.803
they offered him a job.
They didn't check his resume?

10:02.836 --> 10:05.038
I told you this guy
was filled with personality.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.273
They do require
background checks.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.741
They gave our guy
the paperwork.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.142
He just never
turned it in.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.713
Well, hello there.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.948
Hi.
You have very

10:14.982 --> 10:16.316
striking features.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.085
You ever thought of getting
in front of a camera?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.921
Think I'd just like
to focus on the case.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.891
Right.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.325
Well...

10:25.358 --> 10:28.261
I can't tell you how surreal
this whole thing is.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.296
If you ever met Ryan...

10:29.329 --> 10:31.164
He's the nicest
guy in the world.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.232
We've heard.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.767
Look, we're trying
to see if maybe

10:33.801 --> 10:35.803
you have some photos of him.
Something you took

10:35.836 --> 10:37.404
for a press release or something
that was taken

10:37.437 --> 10:39.807
at an office party? Anything?

10:39.840 --> 10:42.042
Well, he was going to have
a picture taken for an ID badge.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.012
But he just kept saying
he hadn't gotten around to it.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.114
Oh, my goodness,
isn't that a shock? Okay.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.315
Why don't we just
get into his computer

10:48.348 --> 10:50.083
so we can see how much
damage he's done?

10:50.117 --> 10:52.953
We're already on it.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.122
You're looking at all
the places he's struck, huh?

10:55.155 --> 10:58.325
LARRY: I was trying to discern
a pattern to his choices.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.994
Why does he select
the targets that he does?

11:01.028 --> 11:02.329
Clearly, there is

11:02.362 --> 11:03.263
a geographic factor,

11:03.296 --> 11:06.333
but, to be truthful,
predictive analytics

11:06.366 --> 11:08.335
is more up Charles'
alley than mine.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.703
Have we figured out
what he was up to?

11:09.737 --> 11:11.138
Well, he was
definitely trying

11:11.171 --> 11:12.372
to access
the agency's funds,

11:12.405 --> 11:13.874
probing for passwords.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.108
And he came
close to hacking

11:15.142 --> 11:16.276
into the client
escrow account.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.310
COLBY:
But he didn't get in?

11:17.344 --> 11:18.378
Doesn't look like it.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.447
LIZ: So, George Bailey
spent more

11:20.480 --> 11:22.883
than two weeks at the agency
with no payoff.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.185
Is he really the type
just to walk away?

11:25.218 --> 11:27.287
So, what are you saying,
he's gonna go back again?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.257
Sounds like I ought to cancel
my plans for tonight, huh?

11:30.290 --> 11:33.226
Yeah, right, Granger,
like you had any plans anyway.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.495
(whispering)

11:35.528 --> 11:37.064
(door opening)

11:38.465 --> 11:40.433
Oh. You're here.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.435
Hey, where were you all day?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.872
Oh, look at this.
Look at this.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.874
They could have put
the parking there,

11:46.907 --> 11:48.408
or even there.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.978
Would have given them
better access to the freeway.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.480
These are the plans
for the city's new project?

11:53.513 --> 11:54.481
Yeah. I got 'em from a guy

11:54.514 --> 11:56.383
who used to work down
at the planning office.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.985
He sent me a copy, and..

11:58.018 --> 11:59.152
(sighs)

11:59.186 --> 12:00.353
Look at this.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.454
Wow.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.423
It's... big.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.026
It's ridiculous is what it is.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.795
What is your issue exactly?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.329
The parking lot, or...?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.231
Well, look where
they're putting it.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.399
Look. Right there.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.167
Right on top of the park.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.502
But...

12:15.535 --> 12:17.504
Well, they've planned
another park here.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.839
It's not my park.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.081
(loud crowd chatter and music)

12:28.115 --> 12:30.517
So this is what it's like to be
on a stakeout.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.885
COLBY:
That's right.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.854
You just let us know
when the thrill gets

12:33.887 --> 12:35.889
to be too much
for you to handle.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.024
Come on, Agent Granger.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.927
Being an FBI agent must be
pretty exciting sometimes.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.962
Uh, it has
its moments.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.531
Tuesday night, and
this club is packed.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.499
Doesn't anybody else
have to work for a living?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.902
It's a fun club.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.338
If you ever wanted to go,
I could get us in.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.541
Yeah, I don't think
it'd really be my thing.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.544
We'd have a good time,
I promise.

12:57.577 --> 13:02.415
I believe it, but, uh,
the bureau frowns pretty heavily

13:02.449 --> 13:04.952
on fraternizing
with potential witnesses.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.888
Oh, wait, guys. Check it out.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.958
Ms. Stone,
is that him?

13:12.525 --> 13:14.361
I recognize the jacket.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.931
DAVID:
All right,

13:17.965 --> 13:19.799
he's going in.
You stay right here.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.203
(loud music and chatter)

13:26.139 --> 13:28.375
LIZ:
Hey, freeze!

13:28.408 --> 13:29.843
DAVID:
Hey!

13:29.877 --> 13:31.444
FBI!

13:31.478 --> 13:33.280
(tires squealing,
horn honking)

13:33.313 --> 13:34.848
Whoa! Get back!

13:34.882 --> 13:37.117
(tires squealing,
horns honking)

13:37.150 --> 13:38.518
He went that way.

13:38.551 --> 13:39.486
DAVID:
Move!

13:39.519 --> 13:41.889
Hey, out of the way! Move!

13:43.056 --> 13:45.458
(panting)
Hey, man!

13:45.492 --> 13:48.495
I didn't do anything.
Easy.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.530
He gave me 100 bucks,
and this jacket.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.564
Who?
Some guy.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.300
Just told me to go
in and out of the building.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.467
Said someone would chase me.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.436
We've been suckered.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.071
Get back! Get back! FBI!

14:02.409 --> 14:05.145
Hey, you!

14:05.178 --> 14:08.315
What? Hey, get off
my bus! Stop!

14:08.348 --> 14:10.117
Stop that guy.
He's stealing

14:10.150 --> 14:11.985
my bus!
Open up!

14:12.019 --> 14:14.587
Would you take a picture
of me and my friends?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.156
No, but I'll take
your camera.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.058
DAVID: Get off the bus
right now! Hey!

14:18.091 --> 14:19.392
Open up!

14:19.426 --> 14:20.527
Gotcha!

14:27.134 --> 14:28.268
Reflection's killing us.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.937
That's the best
the lab can do?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.639
Yeah. I mean, the techs
worked on it all night.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.074
That's twice
this guy has played us.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.342
He's starting to piss me off.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.644
AMITA: Well, I spent
some more time

14:37.677 --> 14:38.545
with his laptop
last night,

14:38.578 --> 14:40.380
and found something
very interesting.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.150
He spent a lot of time mining
Social Security numbers.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.918
LIZ:
Hmm. Why?

14:44.952 --> 14:46.619
You think he's branching off
into identity theft.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.621
COLBY: It supports the theory
that he's connected

14:48.655 --> 14:49.990
to one of the European
syndicates.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.158
LARRY:
You know something?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.326
You have managed
to catch an image here.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.494
Unfortunately, it's not useable.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.695
No, no, no, no, no.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.629
Not this one. Not that.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.266
Right there
on the busman's thermos cap.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.668
Can you just
enlarge this bit?

15:01.701 --> 15:03.603
COLBY: Yeah, actually,
I can.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.671
Give me a second.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.738
(computer chirping)

15:05.772 --> 15:08.575
Well, what are we supposed
to do with that, Larry?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.343
It's too distorted.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.980
Yeah. Well, certainly
to the limited human eye,

15:13.013 --> 15:15.248
it lacks the physiognomy
of a normal face.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.716
AMITA: The image has
been altered

15:16.749 --> 15:18.618
by the refracting nature
of the surface,

15:18.651 --> 15:19.652
but there's still
information here.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.454
It's called
non-linear warping.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.722
LARRY: That's right.
It's simply

15:22.755 --> 15:24.091
a matter of perspective.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.126
You take the earliest
astronomers gazing

15:26.159 --> 15:27.627
at the heavens through
their rudimentary telescopes.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.964
Now, they had a magnified image,
but it was flat.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.299
It was two-dimensional.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.668
They knew nothing
of the depth, the dimension,

15:35.702 --> 15:37.737
the measureless immensity

15:37.770 --> 15:39.606
that we can now behold

15:39.639 --> 15:42.475
thanks to Fourier
and the Hubble telescopes.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.578
They simply lacked
the proper perspective.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.747
What Larry is saying is,
we may be able

15:47.780 --> 15:50.617
to calculate the correct
perspective for this image.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.587
(indistinct shouting)

15:56.756 --> 15:58.358
MAN:
Come on, man!

15:58.391 --> 16:00.427
(sighs)

16:00.460 --> 16:02.429
You sure this is the park?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.064
(car door closes)

16:04.097 --> 16:06.033
(indistinct shouting)

16:08.701 --> 16:11.571
Well, it's probably been
25 years since I've been here,

16:11.604 --> 16:13.473
but this is it.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.643
Ah, looks like it's
been put to good use.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.279
Well, I know it doesn't look
like much right now,

16:19.312 --> 16:22.415
but you have to understand
what was going on at the time.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.717
It was only a short time
after the riots.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.486
The neighborhood
was badly scarred.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.022
They had burnt-out
liquor stores

16:29.056 --> 16:32.725
and vacant markets.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.594
You decided to
build a park.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.628
You know what?

16:35.662 --> 16:38.398
Tell you the truth,
it was your mother's idea.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.233
Really?
Yeah.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.534
We already had Donny,

16:41.568 --> 16:43.436
and she was probably
pregnant with you.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.605
Took eight months
to push this plan through.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.774
(indistinct shouting)

16:47.807 --> 16:50.510
Hey, remember Tyler James?

16:50.543 --> 16:53.046
Um... yeah.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.481
Played for UCLA.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.516
Yeah. He went on
to play for the Sixers.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.751
It was right here
on this court that he started.

16:58.785 --> 17:02.622
So, that's why you always
followed the Sixers so closely.

17:04.657 --> 17:08.761
You know, my guess is,
this park saved a lot of kids.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.635
I'm sorry.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.604
I know, it can't be easy.

17:17.637 --> 17:21.274
All your hard work...

17:21.308 --> 17:23.276
and they're wiping it away.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.523
So Ryan isn't really Ryan.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.757
That's a crime?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.726
You're not angry
your boyfriend lied to you

17:39.759 --> 17:40.760
about who he was?

17:40.793 --> 17:42.729
Nobody in this town
is who they say they are.

17:42.762 --> 17:43.830
Why should he be
any different?

17:43.863 --> 17:46.466
Wow. Then, you're a hell
of a lot

17:46.499 --> 17:48.201
more understanding
than I would be.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.569
I'd be a hypocrite if I wasn't.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.338
Kelly Rand isn't
my real name.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.240
I don't even know my real name.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.742
Kelly was raised
in foster care.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.545
KELLY: Ryan's the first guy
who wasn't freaked out

17:58.578 --> 18:00.613
by my foster care
horror stories.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.749
He actually wanted to hear.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.286
Can we be done
with this now?

18:06.319 --> 18:07.487
Kelly's been
up all night.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.122
She just got off
a long flight.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.790
Do you know where Ryan is?

18:10.823 --> 18:12.692
No.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.861
And I hope
you never find him.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.499
Well, she's either got
a heart of stone,

18:19.532 --> 18:21.634
or she's a hell
of a good actress.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.570
Yeah, well, I've
seen the new show.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.139
I'd go with
heart of stone.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.640
How's that?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.809
LARRY: Yeah, higher,
higher, higher. Yes!

18:29.842 --> 18:31.110
There.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.449
Charlie, don't move.

18:36.483 --> 18:39.786
His head was like this.
His head was like this. Yeah.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.788
Boy, you make a terrible
assistant, you know that?

18:41.821 --> 18:43.856
Then let's trade places
for a while.

18:43.890 --> 18:44.657
You're not even supposed
to be here now.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.693
Okay, well, why...
why am I here?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.761
Uh, because the dummy
the biomechanics department

18:48.795 --> 18:51.164
gave Larry was too heavy
for him to carry.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.233
You're here because
I couldn't bear

18:53.266 --> 18:54.701
to watch you pout any longer.

18:54.734 --> 18:55.768
Poor testament

18:55.802 --> 18:56.703
to your powers
of observation,

18:56.736 --> 18:58.571
'cause you failed

18:58.605 --> 19:00.373
to notice
that I have not been pouting.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.342
You do seem much more Zen
about the whole situation.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.544
Well, my brother's career
is on the line.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.845
My father's losing his park.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.414
Kind of puts things
in perspective.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.482
I just want there
to be a decision,

19:09.516 --> 19:11.651
one way or the other.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.396
I didn't realize

19:23.430 --> 19:25.265
lip-reading was one
of your superpowers.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.400
What's going on?
How-How'd it go?

19:27.434 --> 19:28.768
Oh! Let's just say,

19:28.801 --> 19:30.837
whatever you've heard
about actresses-- probably true.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.405
(laughs)

19:32.439 --> 19:34.807
Are you all right?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.510
Yeah, you know. It's...

19:37.544 --> 19:38.511
It's this thing with Charlie.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.347
Yeah, it's just that,

19:40.380 --> 19:42.649
before all this,
we weren't very close and...

19:42.682 --> 19:43.783
So, you're worried that,

19:43.816 --> 19:46.619
if Charlie stops working
for the FBI, you guys are gonna

19:46.653 --> 19:48.788
grow apart again.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.890
You guys have a bond now.
It's not just gonna disappear.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.260
(phone ringing)

19:53.293 --> 19:55.695
(sighs):
Yeah.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.299
Uh-huh.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.902
Okay. I'm on my way.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.871
This is it.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.977
Larry, why'd you stop?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.979
Oh, a moment
of contemplation.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.647
Contemplation,

20:14.681 --> 20:16.783
or second thoughts?

20:16.816 --> 20:18.885
You know, working cell by cell
may suffice,

20:18.918 --> 20:19.819
certainly in producing splines,

20:19.852 --> 20:22.289
but there must be
a more elegant approach.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.657
How's it coming?

20:26.826 --> 20:27.994
CHARLIE:
I was just wondering

20:28.027 --> 20:29.496
if either of you were hungry.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.963
AMITA: Oh. Really?
You're not here

20:30.997 --> 20:32.565
to check up on our progress?

20:32.599 --> 20:33.466
Maybe a little.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.634
ALAN:
Ah, so here's

20:34.667 --> 20:35.868
the brain
trust.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.404
Heard about the park, Alan.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.306
I'm sorry. I haven't
given up yet.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.740
I've been political in my time.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.709
There's no reason why
I can't be political again.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.976
In fact, you know
what I was thinking?

20:44.010 --> 20:46.513
I was thinking
about organizing an opposition

20:46.546 --> 20:48.014
in the neighborhood,
and then,

20:48.047 --> 20:49.882
starting a petition,
and taking that petition

20:49.916 --> 20:51.551
to the Board of Supervisors.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.685
AMITA: You know,
if you need

20:52.719 --> 20:53.986
any rabble-rousers, let us know.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.655
Thank you. I'll call on you.
-Okay.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.657
(phone ringing)

20:57.690 --> 20:59.892
It's Don.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.362
Hey, what's up?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.866
They've made a decision.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.638
(elevator bell dings)

21:11.671 --> 21:13.940
(applause)

21:17.377 --> 21:19.346
Welcome back,
Professor.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.913
DAVID:
Ah!

21:20.947 --> 21:23.015
Must feel good
to be legit again.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.385
Yeah. I got to admit,
it feels pretty good.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.686
Come on in.
Welcome back.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.054
Here you go.
This is temporary.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.556
The real one's
coming soon.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.391
Oh. That was
a close one, huh?

21:31.424 --> 21:33.993
I don't know
how we got out of it, brother.

21:34.026 --> 21:34.961
Mm, but we did.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.796
Now this feels like the
unit I used to know.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.964
How are you?
Good.

21:37.997 --> 21:41.401
So, you ready to
get back to work?

21:41.434 --> 21:44.036
Yeah. Actually, Larry and Amita
have something for you guys.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.872
Uh, the correction program
for your photograph.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.441
Now, it's not perfect,
but it's a huge improvement

21:48.475 --> 21:49.976
over what you had.

21:50.009 --> 21:53.446
Okay. Here's what happens
when we apply the correction.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.415
(computer chirps and trills)

21:58.751 --> 22:00.920
Is that the man you saw?

22:00.953 --> 22:02.789
It's close. I don't know.
Is there anything more

22:02.822 --> 22:03.890
you can do to it?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.858
Uh, let's try
diffeomorphic matching.

22:05.892 --> 22:06.926
Okay, we can
probably play

22:06.959 --> 22:08.395
with the refraction
threshold.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.762
No. Wait. I-I see it.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.364
I see it. Just, uh...

22:11.398 --> 22:12.865
All right.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.967
CHARLIE:
What if we...

22:15.001 --> 22:16.769
do... something like...

22:16.803 --> 22:18.938
this?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.079
DAVID:
That's it.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.180
That's our guy.

22:28.214 --> 22:31.384
All right, I'll run it
through facial recognition.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.587
CHARLIE:
Sorry, I didn't mean

22:34.621 --> 22:36.022
to take over like that.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.123
LARRY: Nonsense--
it's great

22:37.156 --> 22:40.393
to have you back.
-DON: Hey.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.862
I've waited
for two years for this.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.099
DAVID: There's no match.
LIZ: Nothing?

22:47.133 --> 22:48.768
What did you run it against?

22:48.801 --> 22:51.070
COLBY: Everything: NCIC,
government employees,

22:51.103 --> 22:52.805
DMV.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.941
The guy's like 25,
he's got no driver's license?

22:54.974 --> 22:55.942
DAVID:
Wait a minute.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.711
Try running it against,
uh, foster care records.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.948
It's a hunch, but, uh, something
that the girlfriend said...

23:05.017 --> 23:06.753
Okay, okay, I got it.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.089
CHARLIE:
Kevin Oliver.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.725
BLOOM:
Are you kidding me?

23:12.759 --> 23:14.661
Wait a minute,
this can't be right.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.063
He's only 18.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.532
We're chasing a kid?

23:26.939 --> 23:28.975
WOMAN:
Of course, I remember Kevin.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.445
We've had a lot of foster kids
here, but not so many

23:32.479 --> 23:34.046
I wouldn't
remember one.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.716
He was a charmer.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.851
One of those kids
who could really

23:38.885 --> 23:39.652
turn it on,
you know?

23:39.686 --> 23:42.589
So, did he get
into much trouble?

23:42.622 --> 23:43.923
Not exactly.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.758
Meaning what?

23:45.792 --> 23:48.528
Well, Kevin always looked older

23:48.561 --> 23:49.696
than he was.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.163
Other kids
looked up to him,

23:51.197 --> 23:52.865
so when someone else

23:52.899 --> 23:56.769
got into trouble,
it was usually my guess

23:56.803 --> 23:58.571
that it was Kevin

23:58.605 --> 23:59.906
who put them up to it.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.042
Our file says that Kevin

24:03.075 --> 24:05.812
entered the foster
care program

24:05.845 --> 24:07.213
after his parents
were killed.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.248
You have any idea how they died?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.751
Car accident.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.685
Drunk driver
got them.

24:12.719 --> 24:16.088
But it was his adoptive
parents, actually.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.091
I always felt for him.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.794
His birth mother
didn't want him.

24:21.828 --> 24:25.732
Then, his adoptive parents
get wiped out.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.937
Seems like more bad luck
than one kid deserves.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.541
BLOOM:
We're close.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.844
Closer than we've ever been,
and he knows it.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.679
He's long gone.
-That's what I thought

24:39.712 --> 24:40.780
after the raid
on the house,

24:40.813 --> 24:42.782
but he stayed around,
I mean, at least long enough

24:42.815 --> 24:44.116
to go back
to the management company.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.718
BLOOM:
Hubris, maybe greed.

24:45.752 --> 24:46.786
You know, he
never did

24:46.819 --> 24:47.920
crack their accounts.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.989
He didn't want
to leave empty-handed.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.758
Maybe.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.827
Look, this guy, he's...
he's photo-phobic, right?

24:54.861 --> 24:56.162
So he's been
able to operate

24:56.195 --> 24:58.565
for the last two years,
partially because

24:58.598 --> 25:00.833
no one's been able to get
a photograph of this guy.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.034
Why would he latch himself

25:02.068 --> 25:03.903
onto a celebrity,
even a minor one?

25:03.936 --> 25:05.738
DON: That's true.
It's a good point.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.874
Fans, paparazzi...
I mean, it's a big risk.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.709
Only reason I can
think of is that he

25:09.742 --> 25:11.544
fell for this girl... for real.

25:11.578 --> 25:12.645
BLOOM:
Yeah, well, you know,

25:12.679 --> 25:14.013
they both have
foster care backgrounds.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.282
Maybe he genuinely
cares for her.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.651
I say we should sit on her--
I'll take the first shift.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.752
All right,
I'm gonna go

25:19.786 --> 25:21.020
get Charlie back on the clock.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.955
N-No, you... you don't
understand.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.725
What I don't want
is a ballot referendum.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.293
What I'm looking to get
are the forms

25:27.326 --> 25:28.895
for a recognized petition.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.863
You under...

25:30.897 --> 25:32.865
Good, thank you.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.967
I don't remember there
being such bureaucracy

25:35.001 --> 25:37.036
involved in trying to just
make a change, you know?

25:37.069 --> 25:39.305
You have no idea what hoops
you have to go through.

25:39.338 --> 25:40.940
Thank you.
You're not giving up, right?

25:40.973 --> 25:41.741
No, of course not.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.643
Who else is gonna
save that park?

25:43.676 --> 25:46.078
Oh, hey, by the way,
Charlie, um...

25:46.112 --> 25:49.148
how was your triumphant return
to the FBI?

25:49.181 --> 25:50.650
(chuckling)

25:50.683 --> 25:51.951
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.853
I mean, it felt pretty great.

25:53.886 --> 25:54.887
(chuckling)

25:54.921 --> 25:56.022
I've been trying
to convince myself

25:56.055 --> 25:56.923
that it didn't matter,

25:56.956 --> 25:58.925
you know, that there
were other things

25:58.958 --> 26:00.292
I could do, and...

26:00.326 --> 26:01.794
I'm glad to be back.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.162
(door opening)

26:03.195 --> 26:03.996
Hey, guys.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.665
Donny.
Hey.

26:05.698 --> 26:08.000
Hey, Charlie,
we got work for you.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.736
We're thinking Oliver's
not working alone, you know?

26:09.769 --> 26:12.705
He's probably with a group
out of Eastern Europe.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.340
What makes you think that?
-It fits the pattern.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.208
We got a guy here in the States
picking locks,

26:16.242 --> 26:18.110
and the rest of them are abroad
sweeping the cash,

26:18.144 --> 26:19.045
which is almost $10 million now.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.280
You want to know which
European syndicate

26:21.313 --> 26:22.649
Kevin Oliver is part of?
-Yeah.

26:22.682 --> 26:23.650
Belief propagation.

26:23.683 --> 26:24.951
Algorithms

26:24.984 --> 26:27.019
that convert scattered
and incomplete information

26:27.053 --> 26:28.855
into a more coherent picture.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.123
Let's say
you are

26:31.157 --> 26:32.659
a TV network on election night,

26:32.692 --> 26:34.927
and you want to be the first
to predict the winner,

26:34.961 --> 26:35.962
so you're gonna gather
information

26:35.995 --> 26:37.029
from all over the country.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.165
And some of that information
is clearly relevant,

26:39.198 --> 26:43.102
like exit polls in Boise
or vote tallies out of Buffalo.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.404
And other information
is subtly related,

26:45.437 --> 26:49.108
like traffic in Houston,
weather reports out of Portland.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.743
What belief propagation does

26:50.777 --> 26:52.411
is it takes massive
amounts of data

26:52.444 --> 26:55.181
and uses probability
calculations to draw

26:55.214 --> 26:57.049
a complete
and accurate conclusion.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.185
In this case, the winner,
or in your case,

26:59.218 --> 27:00.753
Kevin Oliver's coconspirators.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.255
Can you get on that?
-Right away.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.925
All right, excellent.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.695
So, I guess it must feel good--
the FBI ruling in your favor.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.730
Yeah, I wish I knew why.

27:11.831 --> 27:12.965
You're overthinking it.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.133
You won.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.167
Be happy.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.103
Yeah.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.711
Morning, sunshine.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.979
Are we Kelly Rand fans yet
or what?

27:27.013 --> 27:29.749
No, but I'd definitely
take her lifestyle.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.950
Dinner at the Ivy.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.051
Drinks at Marmont.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.320
Then she went to
three different clubs.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.689
That sounds
about like my night,

27:36.723 --> 27:39.291
minus the dinner,
the drinks and the clubs.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.428
She nearly killed me.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.996
You're gonna have it
much easier, though.

27:44.030 --> 27:44.997
She'll probably
sleep all day.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.699
All right, bye.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.439
What is this?

27:56.809 --> 27:58.310
She waits till now
to get interesting.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.980
That's awesome.

28:16.796 --> 28:19.899
*

28:32.879 --> 28:35.081
If she came here to surf,
she forgot her board.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.387
How do you want to handle it?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.823
Uh, it's up to
you, but...

28:43.856 --> 28:45.057
they've both seen me before.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.527
Kevin?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.830
Kevin, where are you?

28:50.863 --> 28:52.832
Kelly.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.335
Hi.
I've been so worried.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.304
How are you?

28:58.337 --> 28:59.939
I'm fine--
I'm better now.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.407
COLBY: Come here,
Skip... Skipper?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.542
Skip, come here, little guy.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.877
Come here, buddy.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.848
Hey, excuse me, you
guys seen my dog?

29:08.881 --> 29:10.116
Uh, no, man, sorry.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.483
I got a picture of him.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.221
Please take a look,
just let me know.

29:17.990 --> 29:18.858
Oh, no...

29:18.891 --> 29:21.093
All right, buddy.
-No, no, let him go!

29:21.127 --> 29:22.161
Let him go!

29:22.194 --> 29:24.797
Stop! Let him go!

29:24.831 --> 29:26.365
Let him go! Let him go!
-Game's over, Kevin.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.500
Let's go.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.006
Bloom, we got him.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.075
You got him-- I
can't believe it.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.544
Bringing him in right now.
-I owe you big, Eppes.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.546
Just don't ask him
what he did to get him,

29:40.579 --> 29:41.881
'cause you don't want to know.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.816
The girlfriend was the key.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.451
See, you're
the greatest.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.820
Congratulations, Eppes.

29:47.854 --> 29:50.589
On this and even more
on the ADIC decision.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.558
Come on, Carl,
can't you let it go?

29:52.591 --> 29:54.226
I suppose you think

29:54.260 --> 29:55.527
this gives you carte blanche now

29:55.561 --> 29:57.329
to do whatever you please
around here.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.331
Who knows?

29:59.365 --> 30:01.500
Maybe it does.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.503
Look, I have no idea
why he ruled the way he did.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.373
Don't play naive, Eppes.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.441
We both know why.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.920
You want to know
something funny, Agent Bloom?

30:20.953 --> 30:23.522
I've always feared this day.

30:23.555 --> 30:26.092
Always.

30:26.125 --> 30:31.263
Now I'm sitting here,
you know what I feel?

30:31.297 --> 30:34.033
Relief.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.102
Being on the run...

30:36.135 --> 30:39.872
it's a rush, but...
man, it's no way to live.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.607
I mean, a kid my age
shouldn't have

30:41.640 --> 30:42.875
to worry about ulcers, right?

30:46.678 --> 30:48.647
And you want to know
the worst part?

30:48.680 --> 30:52.919
Always pretending
to be somebody else.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.921
I swear to God, Bloom...

30:54.954 --> 30:56.588
I've been so many
different people

30:56.622 --> 30:57.924
over these past two years,

30:57.957 --> 31:00.159
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.965
But you're gonna miss me,
you know that?

31:05.998 --> 31:07.533
The game?

31:07.566 --> 31:10.937
I mean, you'll be back
busting bank robbers

31:10.970 --> 31:13.005
or whatever,
and you'll see.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.673
It won't be the same.
-BLOOM: Why don't you

31:14.706 --> 31:16.408
wipe that smile
right off your face,

31:16.442 --> 31:18.110
Kevin, 'cause it's
not working on me.

31:18.144 --> 31:19.278
You've deceived
so many people.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.980
You cheated them
out of their money.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.415
Come on, Bloom,
I never hurt anyone.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.051
I only stole
what I needed

31:25.084 --> 31:26.185
and never from an individual.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.254
It was practically petty theft.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.621
9.8 mil is hardly petty theft.

31:29.655 --> 31:30.622
KEVIN:
What?

31:30.656 --> 31:33.559
I took maybe 75 grand, tops.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.927
August 18, 2006.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.964
$238,622.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.565
October 30, same year.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.501
$186,242.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.602
What about December?

31:43.635 --> 31:44.937
Oh, now we're getting

31:44.971 --> 31:46.405
really bold.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.942
$386,452.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.643
I can go on

31:51.677 --> 31:53.679
and on and on... you know why?

31:53.712 --> 31:55.414
Because I know every penny.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.548
You saw how I live.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.250
Am I a guy with $10 million?

31:58.284 --> 31:59.651
Look, we can
help you out.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.653
We can get you a deal--
just gotta tell us

32:01.687 --> 32:03.489
who you're working with.
-Who I'm what?

32:03.522 --> 32:06.158
You see, Don, I think that
he needs time to think,

32:06.192 --> 32:08.027
so why don't we try

32:08.060 --> 32:11.363
the Federal Detention
Center, 'cause it

32:11.397 --> 32:12.531
will change your mind...

32:12.564 --> 32:14.266
(snaps fingers) like that.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.371
CHARLIE:
No, Don's wrong.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.974
He has to be, because there
is not a single node

32:22.008 --> 32:23.409
connecting
to a European syndicate

32:23.442 --> 32:26.012
or anything overseas
for that matter.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.980
So their theory is wrong,
but nonetheless,

32:28.014 --> 32:30.716
a negative finding is
still a finding of value.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.184
Kevin Oliver
also lacks nodes

32:32.218 --> 32:34.086
connecting to any
of the major thefts.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.388
So he didn't steal
the $10 million.

32:36.422 --> 32:39.391
No, at least not according
to my belief propagation.

32:39.425 --> 32:40.326
ALAN:
Hello, everybody.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.494
Hey, how goes the
battle with city hall?

32:42.528 --> 32:44.263
Well, I've, um...

32:44.296 --> 32:46.265
I've raised the white flag.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.299
You're kidding. Why?

32:47.333 --> 32:48.367
Well, I've been thinking

32:48.400 --> 32:50.069
about something
that Charlie said

32:50.102 --> 32:52.271
about the park
being my hard work.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.774
And I realized that, um,
fighting to preserve it

32:55.807 --> 32:57.443
is just my being selfish,

32:57.476 --> 32:59.145
you know?

32:59.178 --> 33:00.646
Simple narcissism, you might
say.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.081
Hey, Dad, that's not what
I meant.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.082
Yeah, I know.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.750
I know, but I've been
studying those plans.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.218
You know,
they're very good.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.120
The project
is a good one,

33:08.154 --> 33:10.089
and, uh...

33:10.122 --> 33:12.791
well, the neighborhood
could certainly use the jobs.

33:12.824 --> 33:13.725
Yeah, but your park...

33:13.759 --> 33:18.097
The plans include a park,
a better one--

33:18.130 --> 33:23.669
you know, with a pool, and, uh,
skate ramps and, uh....

33:25.437 --> 33:27.073
Well, come on, let's face it,

33:27.106 --> 33:29.075
I'm the only one that's going
to miss that old park.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.511
Just me.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.516
(buzzer)
Thanks.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.051
I put in
the request sheet.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.086
They're bringing
him out.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.087
Okay, good.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.090
So, Charlie thinks Kevin's
telling the truth,

33:44.123 --> 33:46.092
that he wasn't involved
in the larger thefts.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.226
Does that make sense?

33:47.259 --> 33:49.095
Does to Charlie.

33:49.128 --> 33:52.098
So, I mean, who pulled
the larger hauls then?

33:52.131 --> 33:54.100
That's what we're
gonna ask Kevin.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.601
Somewhere along the way he
must've told someone

33:55.634 --> 33:57.103
about his operation;

33:57.136 --> 34:00.172
and then they just figured
out how to exploit it.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.140
Gonna be a moment.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.574
We're having difficulty, uh,

34:02.608 --> 34:04.076
finding the prisoner.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.211
What do you mean?
Where is he?

34:05.244 --> 34:07.446
We're gonna order a lockdown,
get a full head count.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.148
We'll find him.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.116
All right,
wait a minute.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.217
Wait a minute.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.518
Hey, roll back
those monitors.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.120
Roll 'em back.
-Yes, sir.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.122
All right, hurry up,
hurry up.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.623
This one right here,
roll that back.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.625
All right,

34:19.658 --> 34:21.093
hurry up. Keep comin',
keep comin'.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.694
Okay, stop right there.

34:23.729 --> 34:24.696
That guy's an attorney.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.864
I signed him out myself.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.667
Granted him early parole
is what you did.

34:35.341 --> 34:36.275
I don't understand.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.244
How the hell does he
just walk out of there?

34:38.277 --> 34:40.246
He convinced a guard he had
a meeting with his lawyer.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.447
The guard lets him into
the Attorney Room,

34:41.480 --> 34:43.249
Public Defender's
in the can,

34:43.282 --> 34:46.252
Kevin grabs his jacket
and his briefcase and....

34:46.285 --> 34:50.356
I mean you gotta admit, this
guy, he's resourceful, anyway.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.395
Hey, what do you
got, Charlie?

34:56.428 --> 34:58.130
Hey, so we've been looking
for the "other thief,"

34:58.164 --> 35:00.599
you know, the one that cleaned
out all the accounts.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.634
And, um, our thinking was
maybe that another employee

35:02.668 --> 35:05.237
along the way figured out
what Kevin Oliver was doing,

35:05.271 --> 35:06.705
and so we started looking
at his coworkers...

35:06.738 --> 35:08.174
And you found someone?

35:08.207 --> 35:09.541
Something else.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.610
An unexpected pattern

35:11.643 --> 35:13.312
of social security numbers.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.146
AMITA: Charlie,
here's another one.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.448
That's-that's 13 now!
-So, so far,

35:16.482 --> 35:18.217
every single business

35:18.250 --> 35:20.452
that Kevin Oliver targeted
had an employee

35:20.486 --> 35:22.154
with a social security
number that falls

35:22.188 --> 35:24.290
into this form.
Seven, eight, two, three...

35:24.323 --> 35:25.757
something, something,
something, six, four.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.393
And there's, at best,
a thousand combinations

35:27.426 --> 35:28.494
in the US

35:28.527 --> 35:30.429
that fit this.
This is no accident.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.432
You're saying that's why Oliver
chose what business to target?

35:33.465 --> 35:34.566
Because one of the
employees had that number?

35:34.600 --> 35:35.634
CHARLIE:
It has to be.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.541
BLOOM:
Hello.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.809
They're all women.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.477
And all in the same age range,

35:45.511 --> 35:46.812
38 to 46.

35:46.845 --> 35:49.415
Wait a minute.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.417
Where's, uh, Kevin Oliver's
Foster Care file?

35:51.450 --> 35:53.252
I need to see
if there's anything

35:53.285 --> 35:54.152
on his adoption in there.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.188
No, you're not going
to find anything.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.190
They're all blacked out to
protect the mother's identity.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.960
Look.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.962
You can still see part
of his mom's social.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.331
CHARLIE:
Mm-hmm.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.533
Seven, eight,
two, three,

36:07.566 --> 36:08.634
something,

36:08.667 --> 36:10.302
something, something,

36:10.336 --> 36:11.937
six, four.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.541
That's the Big Score
Kevin Oliver's been after.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.509
He's trying to find his mother.

36:20.779 --> 36:23.582
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.517
COLBY: That's what you said
last time.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.553
Then you took a little walk
underneath the pier.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.688
So, why don't you just tell me
where he is, Kelly?

36:29.721 --> 36:31.257
I know he's not going anywhere

36:31.290 --> 36:33.259
without telling you.
I'm done talking.

36:33.292 --> 36:37.496
From now on, you can go
through my lawyers.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.531
Never mind, Colby.
We found his mother.

36:39.565 --> 36:40.666
Bloom got a judge

36:40.699 --> 36:42.534
to open up his
adoption records.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.303
A couple of San
Diego agents

36:44.336 --> 36:45.604
just brought her up.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.974
Well, we're done here then.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.586
So, how long before
she makes the call?

37:00.619 --> 37:02.354
My guess,
as soon as she

37:02.388 --> 37:04.390
gets out of
the elevator.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.766
Think he'll go
for the bait?

37:14.800 --> 37:17.903
He's been searching
for her for two years.

37:17.936 --> 37:21.239
Maybe he's the type to be
patient, but I doubt it.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.276
Need a cab, ma'am?

37:31.583 --> 37:32.551
Wait.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.820
He's in the cab.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.288
He's in the cab!

37:36.322 --> 37:37.323
Take the taxi!

37:37.356 --> 37:38.990
(tires screeching)

37:41.627 --> 37:42.428
OFFICER:
All teams!

37:42.461 --> 37:43.562
This way, ma'am.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.863
FBI!

37:44.896 --> 37:46.898
...on suspect, moving in.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.567
No. No! You're...

37:48.600 --> 37:50.569
He just got out of the vehicle.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.270
Agents, go! Go, go, go!

38:01.947 --> 38:03.449
Is that really her?

38:03.482 --> 38:05.083
Is that my mother?
Hold on.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.653
Wait, you got to give me a
minute with her, please man.

38:09.821 --> 38:10.789
I'll tell you what--

38:10.822 --> 38:12.791
you'll catch up with her
in 20 years, all right?

38:12.824 --> 38:14.626
Wait, wait, hold on.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.427
Oh, no.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.496
He does not deserve this.
-Hey.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.898
Take your time.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.600
What?
Let's just go

38:21.633 --> 38:22.934
for a little walk.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.478
So his first target was
a software company

38:32.511 --> 38:33.945
owned by your sister.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.647
What, this was personal?

38:35.681 --> 38:37.649
I told you right from the
beginning it was personal.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.351
I just didn't tell you why.
-Come on.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.086
What-- he got away
with a couple thousand bucks,

38:41.119 --> 38:42.588
you launched
a full investigation.

38:42.621 --> 38:43.855
It's my sister.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.024
The regular cops wouldn't
even give it a look.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.494
Because it was petty theft.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.496
You don't get it do you?

38:50.529 --> 38:52.798
This guy keeps getting
away with everything.

38:52.831 --> 38:53.832
He's laughing at us.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.933
You saw him in
interrogation.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.602
He's making us
look like idiots.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.870
He's making me
look like an idiot.

38:59.971 --> 39:03.942
Oh, so you raised the stakes.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.944
Yeah, Charlie couldn't
connect him to that 10 mil.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.613
What happens
if he looked into you?

39:07.646 --> 39:10.949
I have just spent every
day of the last two years

39:10.982 --> 39:12.618
chasing this punk.

39:12.651 --> 39:15.387
I could've retired eight
months ago, but I didn't.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.889
I stayed until
this job was done.

39:17.923 --> 39:21.026
So you go out on a win,
eight figures in the bank.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.028
If...

39:23.061 --> 39:25.397
I took the money.

39:25.431 --> 39:26.432
Yeah.

39:26.465 --> 39:27.399
It would have only been

39:27.433 --> 39:30.569
to get this case the
attention it deserves.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.604
It would have been
put in a trust.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.607
Kid gets caught, every
penny goes back.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.744
Two years, Eppes.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.680
You do what you got to do
in order to get the job done.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.748
You know that.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.431
Just read your brief
on Agent Bloom.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.799
You willing to
stand by it?

40:00.832 --> 40:02.601
Meaning?
Meaning,

40:02.634 --> 40:04.870
on your say-so, I'm about to
erase a man's 34-year career;

40:04.903 --> 40:07.506
so I'm trying
to figure out

40:07.539 --> 40:09.475
which side of the line
you stand on.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.744
Well, maybe if the line stopped
moving, Carl, I could tell you.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.449
It's a funny thing,
but, uh...

40:19.551 --> 40:22.854
...I was thinking
that you were as surprised

40:22.888 --> 40:25.090
by the ADIC's decision as I was.

40:27.959 --> 40:31.630
Maybe it is more about "get
things done" these days.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.666
Maybe that's more appropriate
for the times. Hmm?

40:34.700 --> 40:37.068
Personally,

40:37.102 --> 40:39.204
I don't have the stomach
for that kind of FBI.

40:39.237 --> 40:40.171
You're not going

40:40.205 --> 40:42.574
to give it up and walk away
on us, are you?

40:42.608 --> 40:44.242
I've got no illusions,

40:44.275 --> 40:46.111
I'm one of the old guys
around here now.

40:46.144 --> 40:47.479
Guys like you,

40:47.513 --> 40:49.715
guys who don't
need boundaries--

40:49.748 --> 40:52.518
could be you're the future
of the Bureau.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.556
Give that to your brother
for me, will ya?

41:15.006 --> 41:16.642
What?

41:16.675 --> 41:18.109
Why is the room

41:18.143 --> 41:19.611
suddenly filled with people
staring at me?

41:19.645 --> 41:20.879
Take a look at these.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.948
Ah, Charlie, please.
No more plans.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.516
-I've seen enough.
These plans are different, Alan.

41:24.550 --> 41:25.817
CalSci is

41:25.851 --> 41:28.587
expanding their mechanical
engineering department.

41:28.620 --> 41:29.454
Right?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.523
They're building a
whole new complex.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.759
The emphasis will be
on eco-friendly design,

41:33.792 --> 41:35.794
minimal carbon footprint--

41:35.827 --> 41:36.828
right up your alley.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.229
Really?
-Larry's already talked

41:38.263 --> 41:39.430
to the Provost,
and if you're interested,

41:39.464 --> 41:41.833
they would love the benefit
of your planning expertise.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.535
Well, at a greatly
discounted rate,

41:43.569 --> 41:44.703
of course, I mean
technically,

41:44.736 --> 41:46.638
you are still a student.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.907
See, it'd be a chance at
a whole new legacy, Dad.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.009
One that might do
a little better

41:51.042 --> 41:52.544
at standing the
test of time.

41:52.578 --> 41:55.146
Well, now this looks
interesting.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.748
CHARLIE:
Hey, where you been?

41:56.782 --> 41:58.584
DON:
Hey.

41:58.617 --> 41:59.985
I've been getting these.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.152
ALAN:
Hey!

42:01.186 --> 42:02.187
AMITA:
Yay!

42:02.220 --> 42:03.288
Your permanent
credentials.

42:03.321 --> 42:04.322
You're officially

42:04.355 --> 42:06.157
official again.
-Yeah, must've

42:06.191 --> 42:08.894
burned McGowan's ass
to give these back.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.229
All right, I'm going to go grab
some beers.

42:11.262 --> 42:12.263
We'll have a victory toast.

42:12.297 --> 42:13.732
Uh, actually, uh,

42:13.765 --> 42:14.833
why don't you guys
go ahead.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.935
All right.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.904
For he's a jolly
good fellow.

42:18.937 --> 42:19.938
Yeah.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.974
Did I hear right
in there?

42:23.008 --> 42:25.143
You actually passed
on a beer?

42:25.176 --> 42:28.179
Well, if you insist.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.248
Look, it's not like I don't
feel good for Charlie.

42:30.281 --> 42:31.617
I just, I-I...

42:31.650 --> 42:34.352
I feel...

42:34.385 --> 42:36.588
like, lost.

42:36.622 --> 42:38.590
Oh.

42:38.624 --> 42:41.159
Well.

42:41.192 --> 42:42.961
When you were 12
years old, you broke

42:42.994 --> 42:45.631
a vase that your mom's
grandmother gave her.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.766
You went absolutely crazy

42:47.799 --> 42:49.801
because she didn't punish you.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.202
Do you remember that?

42:51.236 --> 42:52.971
Yeah, I remember that.
-Well, maybe

42:53.004 --> 42:54.973
you feel you got away
with something here,

42:55.006 --> 42:58.209
and that, next time, no one
will be there to stop you.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.045
Well, don't worry--

43:00.078 --> 43:01.179
someone will be there.

43:01.212 --> 43:02.213
You.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.182
You'll be there.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.922
Is that supposed
to make it easier?

43:10.956 --> 43:13.358
Who said it's supposed
to get easier?
