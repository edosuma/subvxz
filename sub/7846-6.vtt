[Scrooge] The Temple
of the Golden Cricket.

00:11.261 --> 00:15.185
Every 50 years, at sundown,
the golden cricket emerges

00:15.185 --> 00:17.267
singing its ethereal song.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.520
Some say the song
holds the answer

00:19.520 --> 00:21.351
to life's
greatest mysteries.

00:21.351 --> 00:22.603
How did we get here?

00:22.603 --> 00:24.404
What's our purpose
in the universe?

00:24.404 --> 00:27.147
Wait, is that
a neon hot dog?

00:27.147 --> 00:28.318
-Wow!
-So cool!

I'm hungry!

00:32.202 --> 00:34.114
[Scrooge]
Yes, yes, the city of Macaw

00:34.114 --> 00:35.656
is very exciting to look at,

00:35.656 --> 00:38.208
but you'll only find
empty distractions there.

00:38.208 --> 00:41.161
I can't believe
Uncle Gladstone is here!

00:41.161 --> 00:43.664
-He's so charming.
-And funny.

00:43.664 --> 00:45.465
He's, like,
the luckiest guy
in the world.

00:45.465 --> 00:47.167
Uh, Uncle Donald
you must've had

00:47.167 --> 00:50.340
the best time
growing up with him.

00:50.340 --> 00:54.474
Hey, $20.

00:59.139 --> 01:01.521
Hey, $20.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.995
He's the worst.
Just the worst.

01:14.995 --> 01:17.868
Gladstone Gander is
a complete layabout.

01:17.868 --> 01:19.870
I don't know why
we're responding
to his call.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.201
It was a call
for help.

01:21.201 --> 01:22.372
And like Uncle Donald says,

01:22.372 --> 01:24.374
"Family always helps family."

01:24.374 --> 01:26.256
Why did I say that?

01:26.256 --> 01:28.669
Plus, he's easily
our coolest uncle.

01:28.669 --> 01:32.052
-Hey!
-Sorry, coolest
non-trillionaire uncle.

01:32.052 --> 01:34.595

I won't wait
another 50 years

you needed help.

and with a cheaper haircut.

convince your Uncle Donald.

Is that "X"

09:49.379 --> 09:50.970
Oh, fine.

09:50.970 --> 09:52.922
But I am not changing
its litter.

09:52.922 --> 09:55.425
Now, about that exit.

09:56.806 --> 09:58.138
-[tiger growls]
-[man exclaims]

09:58.138 --> 09:59.769
That guy at the mall
with the iguana

09:59.769 --> 10:02.352
is gonna be so jealous.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.354
Give her a spin!

10:11.531 --> 10:14.234
-[game ringing]
-Whoo! Yeah!

10:14.234 --> 10:15.945
[Louie laughing]

10:15.945 --> 10:17.537
[laughs] Can't waste
all the luck on me.

10:17.537 --> 10:19.829
[scoffs]
I got this.

10:23.002 --> 10:24.374
[machine creaking]

10:26.796 --> 10:28.798
[patrons screaming]

10:28.798 --> 10:32.592
[items crashing, banging]

10:32.592 --> 10:34.924
[announcer]
<i>Attention, the 3:15 performance</i>

10:34.924 --> 10:37.717

10:46.356 --> 10:48.148
-Eight?
-No.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.112
-Five?
-No.

10:53.112 --> 10:54.444
Twenty-seven?

10:54.444 --> 10:56.115
No.

10:56.115 --> 10:58.618
-Twenty-seven.
-No.

10:58.618 --> 11:01.911
-Twenty-seven?
-No.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.165
How does he think he's
holding up 27 fingers?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.627
I don't know, Lou.
I just don't know.

11:13.753 --> 11:18.057
I navigated myself out of
the Infinitaur's labyrinth.

11:18.057 --> 11:21.471
Freed myself from the
Forever Fields of Fantoom.

11:21.471 --> 11:24.854
Why can't I find
the blasted hotel exit?

11:24.854 --> 11:26.356
[Webby]
Oh, don't worry.
I left a trail

11:26.356 --> 11:28.398
of snacks behind us
to mark our path.

11:32.071 --> 11:34.614
-[Webby groans]
-He's a tiger.

11:34.614 --> 11:36.446
You tell him
not to eat something.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.488
You look tired,
Mr. McDuck.

11:38.488 --> 11:41.160
I implore you to
check in to a room.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.913
Oh, no, we are
not interested.

11:43.913 --> 11:45.785
At least stay for lunch

11:45.785 --> 11:47.747
at our Buffet of Many Lands!

11:47.747 --> 11:50.750
You can visit the entire world
on a single dinner plate.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.002
Imagine taco dim sum.

11:53.002 --> 11:54.674
Fettucine eclairs.

11:54.674 --> 11:58.638
Why would I want
to imagine
any of that?

11:58.638 --> 12:01.891
Sorry, sir,
but the only thing
we're hungry for

12:01.891 --> 12:05.555
is adventure and--
is that a fountain
made of chocolate?

12:05.555 --> 12:07.897
You can dip
positively anything
in it.

12:07.897 --> 12:09.689
-Strawberries?
-Mm-hmm.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.481
-What about my hand?
-Sure.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.902
What about your hand?

12:12.902 --> 12:15.355
Um, uh, fine.

12:15.355 --> 12:18.778
Wait!
What about the Temple
of the Golden Cricket?

12:18.778 --> 12:21.781
What about the mysteries
of the universe?

12:21.781 --> 12:24.994
What about a nice, warm bed?

12:24.994 --> 12:28.788
Fine, check me in.

12:28.788 --> 12:30.870
Twenty-seven.
Twenty-seven.

12:30.870 --> 12:32.252
Twenty-seven!

12:32.252 --> 12:34.874
Ugh, give it up,
Uncle Donald.
Please.

12:34.874 --> 12:36.756
No, no, no, no.
Let it ride.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.837
-You're about to--
-Two?

12:37.837 --> 12:40.300
We have a winner!
Congratulations.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.141
You won a brand-new
Thunderclutch sports car.

12:42.141 --> 12:45.054
[laughs]
Great.

12:45.054 --> 12:46.936
This is the second car
I've won for--

12:46.936 --> 12:50.440
Four? [laughs]
You win again!

12:50.440 --> 12:53.273
Seriously?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.355
Wow, you really
can't lose.

12:55.355 --> 12:57.156
Yeah, I know.

12:57.156 --> 12:58.318
So close, Big D.

12:58.318 --> 12:59.449
Hey, how about we play--

12:59.449 --> 13:01.200
Oh, I give up.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.902
I came to help you.

13:02.902 --> 13:06.406
And instead you embarrass me
in front of the boys.

13:06.406 --> 13:08.668
Wh-- I'm not trying
to embarrass you.

13:08.668 --> 13:09.999
I just wanted to give
you and the fam

13:09.999 --> 13:11.751
a taste of the good life.

13:11.751 --> 13:13.623
By showing them
I'm a loser?

13:13.623 --> 13:15.915
Ugh, winners, losers,
who cares?

13:15.915 --> 13:18.177
If you want to
impress them,
keep playing.

13:18.177 --> 13:19.919
Your luck is bound
to change.

13:19.919 --> 13:21.090
[car horn honks]

13:21.090 --> 13:22.972
Hey, Uncle Gladstone!

13:22.972 --> 13:24.884
-[honks horn]
-I'm done.

13:24.884 --> 13:26.976
Wait, no!

13:26.976 --> 13:28.558
Uncle Donald's
taking a break, huh?

13:28.558 --> 13:29.979
Well, then this is
the perfect time

13:29.979 --> 13:32.061
for us to hit the
big winner's tables.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.934
I don't need you.
I need him.

13:34.934 --> 13:36.606
You'll feel so much better
after a night

13:36.606 --> 13:38.027
in one of our luxury suites.

13:38.027 --> 13:40.740
Maybe a week.
Perhaps a year.

13:40.740 --> 13:41.991
You may never
want to leave.

13:41.991 --> 13:44.654
I'll need a room
with a personal sauna,

13:44.654 --> 13:47.036
a poolside view,
and a distraction.

13:47.036 --> 13:48.538
A what?

13:48.538 --> 13:50.159
[Scrooge]
Check-in is always
by the exit.

13:50.159 --> 13:52.001
Thanks for the help, Liu Hai!

13:53.373 --> 13:56.085
Come on, kids.
We can make it in time

13:56.085 --> 13:57.877
for the Golden Cricket's
last chorus.

13:57.877 --> 13:59.549
I'm with you.
Let's go.

13:59.549 --> 14:00.630
Where you going, cuz?

14:00.630 --> 14:01.631
There's tons more games.

14:01.631 --> 14:02.632
Oh, and the buffet.

14:02.632 --> 14:04.053
I get it.

14:04.053 --> 14:05.555
You're the cool uncle.

14:05.555 --> 14:08.347
I'm not.
Have fun!

14:10.640 --> 14:12.642
[Gladstone grunts]

14:14.814 --> 14:16.025
[laughing]
Oh, dang.

14:16.025 --> 14:18.398
Did I not mention
I'm a prisoner here

14:18.398 --> 14:20.279
and that's why
I called you for help?

14:20.279 --> 14:22.902
What?
Why didn't you just tell us?

14:22.902 --> 14:24.824
[Liu Hai]
Because I'd find out.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:43.673 --> 14:49.769
I am Liu Hai, ancient spirit
of chance and fortune.

14:49.769 --> 14:53.222
Now, let's test your luck.

14:53.222 --> 14:56.225
Finally, a proper adventure.

14:58.478 --> 14:59.859
[evil laughter]

14:59.859 --> 15:01.901
I sat through
The Waters of Aquanadon

15:01.901 --> 15:04.193
three times when I could've been
fighting a demon?

15:04.193 --> 15:05.945
It's Aquarioon.
[grunts]

15:05.945 --> 15:07.697
Uh, yeah, you don't wanna
mess with Toad.

15:07.697 --> 15:09.028
He's a luck vampire.

15:09.028 --> 15:10.159
He's held me captive here

15:10.159 --> 15:11.991
to feast off my
natural good luck.

15:11.991 --> 15:13.082
I'm that delicious.

15:13.082 --> 15:15.124
Are you bragging
about that?

15:15.124 --> 15:17.587
I hoped Donald
would break
my lucky streak.

15:17.587 --> 15:19.088
-You know, 'cause he's--
-Bad luck.

15:19.088 --> 15:20.419
-A total jinx.
-The worst.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.884
Gladstone's good fortune
has been satisfying,

15:24.884 --> 15:27.887
but surely, as the
richest duck in the world,

15:27.887 --> 15:31.681
Scrooge McDuck's luck must be
the most delicious feast of all.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.313
Luck has nothing to do
with my success.

15:34.313 --> 15:36.105
Oh, really?

15:36.105 --> 15:38.267
I'll prove it.
One game.

15:38.267 --> 15:40.980
If I win, you set us free.

15:40.980 --> 15:44.273
If you win, we stay...
permanently.

15:44.273 --> 15:47.737
Unless you think the spirit
of luck and fortune will lose.

15:47.737 --> 15:50.910
Hmm, I can't resist
such a challenge.

15:50.910 --> 15:53.703
Yes! Thank you,
Screwdriver
McDollarsigns.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.284
I knew I could count on you.

15:55.284 --> 15:58.127
Behold.

15:58.127 --> 16:00.840
[Liu Hai]
First to the end wins.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.964
Okay, Toad, let's do this.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.546
[Liu Hai]
Unh-unh-unh.

16:06.546 --> 16:09.138
My house, my rules.

16:09.138 --> 16:11.300
Gladstone still
belongs to me.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.182
So he is my champion.

16:13.182 --> 16:16.185
You get--
Hmm, him.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.476
[gulps]

16:17.476 --> 16:19.188
The winner goes free.

16:19.188 --> 16:22.231
The loser is doomed.

16:23.563 --> 16:25.154
[evil laughter]

16:25.154 --> 16:26.656
I don't even
get to be part

16:26.656 --> 16:28.197
of the blasted challenge?

16:31.160 --> 16:33.613
We came out here
to help you

16:33.613 --> 16:35.745
and you put our family
in danger.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.667
I'm sorry, Don.
I really am.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.619
But I literally
just can't lose.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.252
-Good luck.
-[groans]

16:51.090 --> 16:52.552
There is only ocean.

16:52.552 --> 16:55.014
[Huey]
There is only light.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.976
And among the primal chaos

16:56.976 --> 16:59.308
lives Aquarioon!

16:59.308 --> 17:00.900
Oh!
Ow, ow, ow!

17:00.900 --> 17:02.191
Aah!
[mutters]

17:25.124 --> 17:26.464

17:26.464 --> 17:28.547
Whoa!

17:32.171 --> 17:34.433
[Donald screams]

17:36.175 --> 17:37.176
Whew!

17:39.308 --> 17:41.060
[Donald screams]

17:43.142 --> 17:44.143
Ow!

17:44.143 --> 17:46.235
Oh.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.280
It's Dewey Junior!

17:51.280 --> 17:53.823
[growling]

17:53.823 --> 17:55.905
[Donald panting]

17:55.905 --> 17:57.286
[panting continues]

17:59.579 --> 18:01.160
Oh, come on!

18:06.335 --> 18:07.877
[grunting]
Aah!

18:11.300 --> 18:13.212
The Buffet
of Many Lands!

18:16.636 --> 18:20.720
[muttering]

18:31.280 --> 18:33.232
Man, I'm really sorry
about this.

18:33.232 --> 18:34.904
I mean, obviously
not sorry enough

18:34.904 --> 18:37.286
to sign up for a lifetime
of servitude, but...

18:42.662 --> 18:43.953
Aww.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.587
Huh? Huh?

18:48.587 --> 18:50.009
[groans]

18:50.009 --> 18:51.460
[low growling]

18:51.460 --> 18:53.342
[evil laughter]

18:53.342 --> 18:55.845
Oh, what's the point?

18:55.845 --> 18:57.096
[Louie]
Come on, Uncle Donald!

18:57.096 --> 18:58.928
So you have the worst
luck in the world.

18:58.928 --> 19:00.019
Who cares?

19:00.019 --> 19:02.181
No matter how bad
things get,

19:02.181 --> 19:03.813
like really, really bad,

19:03.813 --> 19:05.224
you keep going.

19:05.224 --> 19:07.316
It's kind of ridiculous.

19:07.316 --> 19:09.939
You never had the common sense
to give up before.

19:09.939 --> 19:11.360
Why start now?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.735
[growling]

19:18.037 --> 19:19.659

19:32.291 --> 19:33.963
Hey, $20.

19:33.963 --> 19:35.384
Where did that
come from?

19:36.926 --> 19:40.299
[Donald grunts, mutters]

19:40.299 --> 19:42.351
[panting]

19:42.351 --> 19:43.512
-Whoa!
-[laughing]

19:43.512 --> 19:44.563
What?

19:44.563 --> 19:48.147
[kids cheering]

19:48.147 --> 19:49.438
Well, at least I still have

19:49.438 --> 19:51.360
the luckiest buffet on Earth.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.402
Bad fortune, Mr. Gander.

19:54.814 --> 19:57.446
Actually, Toad,
Gladstone lost to Donald

19:57.446 --> 20:00.409
so technically, Donald is
the new luckiest guy on Earth.

20:00.409 --> 20:02.241
It's really him
you should take.

20:02.241 --> 20:04.203
Yeah!
Wait, no!

20:04.203 --> 20:06.996
Hmm, a well-reasoned argument.

20:06.996 --> 20:08.998
Donald Duck is my prize.

20:08.998 --> 20:10.419
That wasn't the deal!

20:10.419 --> 20:13.422
All bets are off.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.295
Uh-oh.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.510
Uncle Donald!

20:21.510 --> 20:23.512
I can't believe
you just gave him up.

20:23.512 --> 20:25.895
The kid's not wrong,
Uncle McDuncle.
What do we do?

20:25.895 --> 20:28.898
Three, two, one.

20:28.898 --> 20:31.150
[Donald muttering, grunts]

20:31.150 --> 20:33.442
His luck, it's awful!

20:33.442 --> 20:35.564
So awful!

20:35.564 --> 20:38.357
[rumbling]

20:45.534 --> 20:47.286
So awful!

20:49.248 --> 20:51.580
You did it, Uncle Donald!
You won!

20:51.580 --> 20:52.962
That was pretty cool.

20:52.962 --> 20:54.543
I mean, especially for you.

20:57.046 --> 20:59.508
How the heck
did I win?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.971
I guess you're not
so lucky, after all.

21:01.971 --> 21:04.093
But if you think about it,
we're all free.

21:04.093 --> 21:07.767
So, me losing is the luckiest
thing that could've happened.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.059
Boom!
Still the luckiest guy on Earth

21:10.059 --> 21:12.942
and a hero.
Huh?

21:12.942 --> 21:15.394
Eh, luck's overrated.

[panting]

21:17.566 --> 21:21.200
Whoa, Launchpad,
what happened to you?

21:21.200 --> 21:23.492
Eh, you know,
tourist stuff.

21:26.455 --> 21:29.208
Goodbye, Ziyi,
wherever you are.

21:32.461 --> 21:35.214
Have I really just been
coasting on my luck,

21:35.214 --> 21:37.877
charm, and ridiculous
good looks?

21:37.877 --> 21:39.508
Who is Gladstone?

21:39.508 --> 21:40.880
I need to get my hands dirty.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.381
Do something meaningful.

21:42.381 --> 21:43.843
A new, noble purpose.

21:43.843 --> 21:45.014
[Woman]
Hey, handsome.

21:45.014 --> 21:47.056
[yacht horn honks]

21:47.056 --> 21:49.388
I need to get rid of my boat
for tax purposes.

21:49.388 --> 21:50.980
I'll sell it to you for $20.

21:50.980 --> 21:54.934
Gladstone is back, baby!

21:56.695 --> 22:00.860
[chirping]

22:00.860 --> 22:02.942
Okay, we can go now.
