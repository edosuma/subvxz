00:02.758 --> 00:03.869
PRIDE:
<i>They're taking her to jail.</i>

00:03.870 --> 00:05.403
SONJA:
<i>I'm in trouble, Lasalle.</i>

00:05.405 --> 00:07.305
They moved me to gen pop.

00:07.307 --> 00:08.373
IZZO: Patton Plame,
I'm gonna need you

00:08.375 --> 00:10.208
to take your hands
off that keyboard.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.509
Your computer specialist
has been involved

00:11.511 --> 00:14.145
in committing
federal cybercrime.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.613
Is this worth risking
your career over?

00:15.615 --> 00:16.714
We catch the killer,

00:16.716 --> 00:17.749
<i>Pride has a chance</i>

00:17.751 --> 00:18.850
<i>to bring down Hamilton.</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:21.286
PRIDE:
<i>“A new threat in Clearwater.”</i>

00:21.288 --> 00:23.521
<i>Hamilton removed</i>
<i>police services weeks ago.</i>

00:23.523 --> 00:25.790
<i>Set up a slush fund</i>
<i>to buy up properties.</i>

00:25.792 --> 00:27.592
<i>Forced people out</i>
<i>who wouldn't sell.</i>

00:27.594 --> 00:28.359
Who are you?

00:28.383 --> 00:30.579
My new security consultant,
Mr. Stone.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.997
STONE:
You said you'd handle NCIS.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
Mr. Stone, Hamilton's guy.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.268
STONE: Target arrives in New Orleans
in approximately 48 hours.

00:37.270 --> 00:39.637
Sounds like they're
talking about some kind of hit.

00:39.639 --> 00:40.772
We're not arresting Stone.
We're gonna follow him.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.374
<i>Take down Hamilton</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:11.069
PRIDE: Stone just pulled over.
He's entering Clement's Seafood.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.307
Stand by.

01:16.309 --> 01:17.408
LASALLE:
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:19.444
<i>We're one street over,</i>
<i>on Fulton.</i>

01:19.446 --> 01:20.812
<i>Want us to alternate?</i>

01:20.814 --> 01:22.380
PRIDE:
<i>No, hold your position.</i>

01:22.382 --> 01:23.915
Let's see what he's up to.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.351
LASALLE: It's a big risk
losing sight of him,

01:26.353 --> 01:27.986
ain't it, King?

01:27.988 --> 01:30.321
All right, we know he's
planning a hit on somebody,

01:30.323 --> 01:31.923
and, uh, we could've
arrested him,

01:31.925 --> 01:33.725
but we decided
to let him go.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.426
No, I chose to let him go.

01:35.428 --> 01:38.396
See who he's after.
Besides, it's Sunday.

01:38.398 --> 01:39.964
Clement's is closed.
I doubt his target's inside.

01:39.966 --> 01:41.733
GREGORIO:
But then what's Stone doing?

01:41.735 --> 01:44.235
We've been tailing him
all the way from Clearwater.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.371
Why stop there?
Could be he spotted us.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.772
Maybe he's hightailing it.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.908
PRIDE:
Stone's headed back to his car.

01:50.910 --> 01:51.876
Already?

01:51.878 --> 01:53.077
PRIDE:
I'll follow him,

01:53.079 --> 01:54.512
you two check out the warehouse,

01:54.514 --> 01:56.881
see if you can figure out
what he was doing in there.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.483
But be careful.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.151
I don't know
what you're gonna find.

02:00.153 --> 02:01.753
LASALLE:
You got it.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.589

(horn honking)

03:03.249 --> 03:05.149

03:06.453 --> 03:08.820
Get down!

03:08.822 --> 03:10.955
Get out of the way!
Get down!

03:14.094 --> 03:15.360
Get down!

03:21.334 --> 03:22.500

You all right?

03:59.005 --> 04:00.505
No, I'm not.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.540
Stone just opened fire.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.575
Crowded street.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.086
Didn't care about
hurting anybody else,

04:06.088 --> 04:07.587
just wanting
to get away from me.

04:07.589 --> 04:09.056
We got to find out
who this joker really is.

04:09.058 --> 04:10.524
Well, he obviously
doesn't think we can.

04:10.526 --> 04:12.392
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
done something like this.

04:12.394 --> 04:14.027
Yeah, well,
whatever Hamilton's up to

04:14.029 --> 04:16.228
has got to be
a lot worse than we thought.

04:16.231 --> 04:17.964
Hire somebody
like that.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.100
LASALLE: Why is NOPD processing
the scene and not us?

04:20.101 --> 04:22.669
Because we don't know who Stone
really is or who he's after.

04:22.671 --> 04:25.639
Still, we're following up on
leads from prior NCIS cases--

04:25.641 --> 04:26.973
Garcia, Clearwater.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.642
We know Hamilton's
behind this all.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.911
Yeah, but,
we're the only ones who do.

04:30.913 --> 04:32.112
And without solid evidence...

04:32.114 --> 04:33.480
It's not an NCIS case.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.981
(woman crying)

04:37.419 --> 04:39.886
You find anything out
at the warehouse?

04:39.888 --> 04:42.756
Lobster, oyster tanks, packing
materials, nothing unusual.

04:42.758 --> 04:44.257
No trace of Stone's pals.

04:44.259 --> 04:46.460
Stone drove there specifically
from Clearwater.

04:46.462 --> 04:48.295
There's got to be a reason.

04:48.297 --> 04:50.130
Call Sebastian, get him
out there, scour the place.

04:50.132 --> 04:52.099
The only problem is we have
Sebastian checking surveillance

04:52.101 --> 04:53.734
hoping to find Stone,
while also trying

04:53.736 --> 04:55.435
to figure out who
his target is.

04:55.437 --> 04:57.270
We're spread very thin here,
thanks to the good mayor

04:57.272 --> 04:59.873
doing everything he can
to break us apart.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.442
Only good news is we're working
on something to try to get

05:02.444 --> 05:04.644
the judge to rescind
Sonja's contempt charge.

05:04.646 --> 05:06.146
Yeah, hopefully get her
out of there

05:06.148 --> 05:07.781
before the other
prisoners eat her alive.

05:07.783 --> 05:10.150
Okay, well, go,
make that happen.

05:10.152 --> 05:14.254
If we can't find Stone, we got
to figure out who he's after.

05:14.256 --> 05:16.490
'Cause whoever
it is and why

05:16.492 --> 05:18.558
is the key to nailing Hamilton.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.428
(crying)

05:23.265 --> 05:25.132
It's not your fault, Pride.

05:25.134 --> 05:28.869
No, it's Hamilton's.

05:38.614 --> 05:40.147
HAMILTON:
The hell are you doing?

05:40.149 --> 05:41.481
Are you out of your mind?

05:41.483 --> 05:42.783
The shooting's
all over the news.

05:42.785 --> 05:44.484
The hell were you thinking?
Relax.

05:44.486 --> 05:46.686
All that matters is we're
on track for tomorrow.

05:46.688 --> 05:48.255
My team cleaned
out the warehouse

05:48.257 --> 05:49.756
before NCIS
found anything.

05:49.758 --> 05:51.424
So why are you here?

05:51.426 --> 05:53.894
Your partners.
They're concerned.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.095
Concerned about what?

05:55.097 --> 05:56.296
Pride.

05:56.298 --> 05:58.064
No matter what you do
to him or his team,

05:58.066 --> 05:59.666
they keep on
investigating.

05:59.668 --> 06:01.368
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

06:01.370 --> 06:02.602
I'll handle Pride.

06:02.604 --> 06:04.204
Meantime, get out of here.

06:04.206 --> 06:07.107
I got a presentation
to prepare.

06:12.314 --> 06:13.914
Your friend's
in a lot of trouble.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.516
Contempt of court is a serious
offense, Agent Lasalle.

06:16.518 --> 06:18.518
I understand, Your Honor.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.921
But you don't understand what'll
happen if you don't let her out.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.823
All right,
I don't have any proof of this,

06:22.825 --> 06:24.858
but a powerful politician,
a corrupt one,

06:24.860 --> 06:26.393
is trying to do
everything in his power

06:26.395 --> 06:27.828
to keep us from busting him.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.564
And every day
Percy is in prison

06:30.566 --> 06:31.832
not only puts her at risk

06:31.834 --> 06:33.266
because of the strings
he's pulled,

06:33.268 --> 06:35.836
but makes it easier for him
to get away with murder.

06:36.905 --> 06:38.572
(sighs)

06:38.574 --> 06:41.107
Sonja did wrong. I get that.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.009
But something
very bad

06:43.011 --> 06:46.012
is gonna happen here
if you don't help us.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.651
GREGORIO: <i>No luck</i>
<i>tracking Stone's getaway.</i>

06:51.653 --> 06:53.620
There's too many gaps
in city surveillance cameras.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.055
I kept losing him in alleys.

06:55.057 --> 06:56.857
I'm-I'm not as
good at this

06:56.859 --> 06:58.825
as Sebastian or
Patton, obviously.

06:58.827 --> 06:59.993
But, uh,

06:59.995 --> 07:01.061
maybe Patton should...

07:01.063 --> 07:02.662
No, I don't
want to risk it.

07:02.664 --> 07:04.364
FBI finds out Patton's
doing cyber anything,

07:04.366 --> 07:06.066
he ends up in jail, too.

07:06.068 --> 07:09.502
Besides, Sebastian thinks
he might've found something

07:09.504 --> 07:11.137
on the Clearwater tape.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.074
Hard copies. That's old school.
I like it.

07:14.076 --> 07:18.411
Yeah. So Sebastian
enlarged this blueprint.

07:18.413 --> 07:23.483
Looks like maybe a... corner
building with a large kitchen.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.552
Yeah?

07:25.554 --> 07:26.920
A restaurant?
Yeah.

07:26.922 --> 07:28.722
Probably in Orleans Parish,

07:28.724 --> 07:30.891
based on what I can
make of the maps.

07:30.893 --> 07:32.792
I think that this is
the cathedral.

07:32.794 --> 07:34.527
It's about the right distance
from the river.

07:34.529 --> 07:36.763
So Stone's targeting
a restaurant in the Quarter?

07:36.765 --> 07:38.064
Looks like.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.900
Problem is there are a lot
of corner restaurants there.

07:39.902 --> 07:42.636
We got to narrow it down if we
got any hope of stopping him.

07:42.638 --> 07:43.937
Yeah.
(monitor beeps)

07:43.939 --> 07:46.473
PATTON:
Hey, anybody home?

07:46.475 --> 07:49.042
Pride. Sebastian.

07:49.044 --> 07:50.677
Roy?

07:50.679 --> 07:52.979
Sorry, Patton,
we were in your office.

07:52.981 --> 07:56.449
Yeah, okay. But don't get
too comfortable in there.

07:56.451 --> 07:58.652
Just so we're clear,
I am coming back.

07:58.654 --> 07:59.719
You better.

07:59.721 --> 08:01.087
We're a little pressed
for time, Patton,

08:01.089 --> 08:02.389
so unless you got something...

08:02.391 --> 08:04.024
Oh, I got something.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.792
But if the FBI come calling,

08:05.794 --> 08:07.527
that's because I kind of,
sort of tapped

08:07.529 --> 08:08.929
into their central server.

08:08.931 --> 08:10.563
But you ain't hear that from me.

08:10.565 --> 08:12.032
Check it out.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.333
Who are they?

08:13.335 --> 08:15.068
Seven VIPs

08:15.070 --> 08:17.704
who all happen to be flying
into New Orleans tomorrow

08:17.706 --> 08:20.607
with a lot of secrecy
and even more security.

08:20.609 --> 08:22.776
PRIDE:
Deputy Secretary of Defense,

08:22.778 --> 08:26.179
Vice Admiral Thompkins,
Congresswoman Angelou.

08:26.181 --> 08:27.814
She's head of
the Armed Services Committee.

08:27.816 --> 08:29.683
Too big a coincidence
for it not to be connected

08:29.685 --> 08:31.351
to Hamilton and Clearwater,
right?

08:31.353 --> 08:33.653
What she said.
The timing is right, too.

08:33.655 --> 08:35.722
Because whoever Stone
is targeting,

08:35.724 --> 08:37.390
we know it's tomorrow.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.892
The question is:

08:38.894 --> 08:40.760
which one is the target?

08:40.761 --> 08:42.261
We find that, we find Stone.

08:42.264 --> 08:44.764
Then catch him in the act,
nail Hamilton,

08:44.766 --> 08:47.334
and I ain't hiding out
in no damn morgue anymore.

08:47.336 --> 08:50.103
Speaking of which,
Doc wanted me to tell you

08:50.105 --> 08:52.472
that she's getting the
shooting Vic transferred here.

08:52.474 --> 08:54.341
Between the bullet
and the casing,

08:54.343 --> 08:57.477
we're hoping we can figure out
who Stone really is.

08:57.479 --> 08:59.679
PRIDE: All right,
let me know when you know.

08:59.681 --> 09:01.614
And good work getting us
those names, Patton.

09:01.616 --> 09:04.150
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.385
Guys, you're not
gonna believe this.

09:05.387 --> 09:07.220
A fish tank?

09:07.222 --> 09:08.555
What? No, oh, yeah, no.

09:08.557 --> 09:10.590
It is fish tank,
or a lobster tank,

09:10.592 --> 09:12.325
or an oyster tank-- I'm
not really sure yet.

09:12.327 --> 09:14.527
All I do know is that
this is the only thing

09:14.529 --> 09:16.162
in that warehouse that
hadn't been bleached clean.

09:16.164 --> 09:17.864
Thinking maybe
his hit squad missed it?

09:17.866 --> 09:20.233
Yeah, that's a good question,
deserves a follow-up.

09:20.235 --> 09:22.035
But I wasn't talking about
the fish tank when I said

09:22.037 --> 09:24.371
you're not gonna believe it,
or frankly, like it.

09:24.373 --> 09:27.974
This city, our city,
deserves better.

09:27.976 --> 09:30.643
And as you all know,

09:30.645 --> 09:33.346
this is not the first time
NCIS and lead agent Pride

09:33.348 --> 09:36.316
have treated our streets like
some kind of Wild West shootout.

09:36.318 --> 09:38.418
This is outrageous,
it's unconscionable,

09:38.420 --> 09:40.754
and I promise to do something
about it once and for all.

09:40.756 --> 09:42.022
(phone beeps)

09:42.024 --> 09:43.890
I've personally spoken
with the director of NCIS...

09:43.892 --> 09:46.426
Turn it off.

09:46.428 --> 09:51.264
Deputy Director Sanchez, NCIS,
wants to talk to me now.

09:53.035 --> 09:54.501
SANCHEZ:
<i>The only reason</i>

09:54.503 --> 09:56.436
the director himself
isn't on this link

09:56.438 --> 09:58.405
is because he's currently
getting an earful from SecDef.

09:58.407 --> 09:59.973
I'm not gonna lie
to you, Dwayne,

09:59.975 --> 10:01.574
you're in a lot of trouble here.

10:01.576 --> 10:04.177
I'm telling you, Dan,
this is all a bunch of crap.

10:04.179 --> 10:05.445
Mayor Hamilton...

10:05.447 --> 10:07.514
Has formally requested
to relocate you

10:07.516 --> 10:08.982
and your team to another city.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.650
Because I'm onto him.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.452
Because he knows that I know
what he's really up to.

10:12.454 --> 10:14.421
And what exactly is he up to?

10:14.423 --> 10:16.890
Well, I-I don't have any clear
proof just yet, but he's...

10:16.892 --> 10:18.725
There is no “buts,” Dwayne.

10:18.727 --> 10:21.027
NCIS is supposed to be
a guest in cities,

10:21.029 --> 10:23.196
under the condition
that we don't make waves.

10:23.198 --> 10:26.366
And, frankly, lately, you've
done nothing but make waves.

10:26.368 --> 10:27.534
Dan, listen to me.

10:27.536 --> 10:28.701
No, you listen to me.

10:28.703 --> 10:30.270
You're one of the best
we've got.

10:30.272 --> 10:32.138
That's why we give you
so much slack.

10:32.140 --> 10:33.406
But now it's become a problem.

10:33.408 --> 10:35.075
And we can't afford
to lose New Orleans

10:35.077 --> 10:38.711
as a base of operations
to protect the Gulf.

10:38.713 --> 10:42.082
You are hereby ordered
to stand down, Agent Pride.

10:42.084 --> 10:45.485
If you do not, I'll have your
badge, do you understand me?

10:47.823 --> 10:50.824
Do you understand?

10:52.294 --> 10:54.227
Yes, sir.

11:04.439 --> 11:06.339
Look who I found.

11:06.341 --> 11:08.341
- I'm free!
- Hey! - Hey!

11:08.343 --> 11:09.609
So happy to see you!

11:09.611 --> 11:11.044
Oh, I'm so glad to be out.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.445
Whoa, you-you, uh,
you showered first, right?

11:12.447 --> 11:13.747
Wait, what's that?

11:13.749 --> 11:15.048
Just the lice epidemic
in prison's

11:15.050 --> 11:16.049
kind of crazy right now...

11:16.051 --> 11:17.717
Get over here, idiot.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.018
I can't believe
the affidavit worked.

11:19.020 --> 11:20.420
I honestly didn't think
it would.

11:20.422 --> 11:21.921
Well, it didn't.
I had to convince the judge

11:21.923 --> 11:23.323
we needed Percy on the case.

11:23.325 --> 11:24.657
My hero.

11:24.659 --> 11:26.359
Well, I'm not so sure
we have a case anymore.

11:26.361 --> 11:28.595
Pretty sure Pride just got
an ass-chewing from HQ.

11:28.597 --> 11:30.430
He's M.I.A.

11:30.432 --> 11:32.699
Is that because of the
shooting yesterday?

11:32.701 --> 11:34.367
No, it's 'cause of Hamilton.
The mayor's obviously doing

11:34.369 --> 11:36.002
everything he can
to get us off his back.

11:36.004 --> 11:37.670
The man doesn't give up,
does he?

11:37.672 --> 11:39.139
Yeah, well, neither do we.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.942
Gregorio, let's get
Percy up to speed.

11:42.944 --> 11:45.411
All right, learn everything you
can about the seven targets.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.944
We need to figure out
which one Stone's after.

11:46.968 --> 11:47.815
Let's go.

11:47.816 --> 11:48.948
All right.

11:48.950 --> 11:50.450
Where are we on this fish tank?

11:50.452 --> 11:51.484
Still fishing.

11:51.486 --> 11:53.720
All right, well, get on it.

11:53.722 --> 11:55.388
We need leads
when Pride resurfaces.

11:55.390 --> 11:57.090
Sooner we connect
Hamilton to all this,

11:57.092 --> 11:58.958
sooner things
get back to normal.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.627
Right. She totally
gave me lice, by the way.

12:00.629 --> 12:03.329
WADE:
<i>You can't do it alone, Dwayne.</i>

12:03.331 --> 12:05.031
That's not the way it works.

12:05.033 --> 12:06.666
Well, then what is
the answer, Loretta?

12:06.668 --> 12:08.401
Hamilton's picking us apart.

12:08.403 --> 12:11.171
Forcing us to focus more
on saving ourselves

12:11.173 --> 12:12.705
than going after him.

12:12.707 --> 12:14.707
It's what he wants,
and it's working.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.943
Still, you have a team.
Not for long I don't.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.044
Not at this rate.

12:18.046 --> 12:19.546
According to the director,

12:19.548 --> 12:23.049
the only way to save my team,
to keep us in New Orleans,

12:23.051 --> 12:24.818
is to drop the case.

12:24.820 --> 12:27.620
Which means let Hamilton go.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.956
And I can't do that.
I won't do that.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.225
Which is also what Hamilton
wants, because the more

12:32.227 --> 12:34.060
you go rogue, the
more ammunition

12:34.062 --> 12:35.295
he has to use against you.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.763
You're your own worst enemy.

12:36.765 --> 12:38.565
I'm not gonna let him
get away with this.

12:38.567 --> 12:42.235
And I'm not gonna let
another innocent person die.

12:42.237 --> 12:44.070
How can I?

12:44.072 --> 12:45.572
So why are you here?

12:45.574 --> 12:48.308
So I can politely listen,
nod, tell you you're right?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.310
Because if that's
what you want,

12:50.312 --> 12:52.912
then you sure as hell
don't know me as well

12:52.914 --> 12:54.180
as I thought you did.

12:54.182 --> 12:56.015
Ouch.

12:59.154 --> 13:03.456
Look, Dwayne,
as far as I'm concerned,

13:03.458 --> 13:06.259
after what Hamilton
threw at you,

13:06.261 --> 13:09.629
I don't blame you
for being pissed.

13:09.631 --> 13:12.866
But I'm telling you, the more
personal you make this,

13:12.868 --> 13:14.234
the more difficult
it's gonna be

13:14.236 --> 13:15.468
to see your way through.

13:15.470 --> 13:17.370
Just don't make it
about Hamilton.

13:17.372 --> 13:19.305
Make it about
stopping a bad guy

13:19.307 --> 13:20.707
from doing a bad thing,

13:20.709 --> 13:22.942
from hurting
anyone else.

13:22.944 --> 13:24.444
And use your team.

13:24.446 --> 13:26.246
You built them,
they're good,

13:26.248 --> 13:27.480
eager, loyal.

13:27.482 --> 13:30.383
They'll follow you
down any rabbit hole.

13:30.385 --> 13:32.552
And you know it.

13:34.489 --> 13:37.223
Probably wouldn't be able
to stop them, anyway.

13:37.225 --> 13:39.959
You should have been a shrink,
you know that?

13:39.961 --> 13:41.628
I prefer corpses.

13:41.630 --> 13:43.730
BOTH:
They don't talk back.

13:50.572 --> 13:52.505
LASALLE:
Everything all right, King?

13:52.507 --> 13:54.474
Some of us were getting
a little worried,

13:54.476 --> 13:55.742
but I won't name names.

13:55.744 --> 13:57.510
Don't listen to him
for a second.

13:57.512 --> 13:58.478
He was worried, too.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.679
He's just trying
to be tough.

13:59.681 --> 14:01.581
Sorry for the radio silence.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.716
I just had to think
things through.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.051
Yeah, that's another way
of saying

14:05.053 --> 14:06.319
Miss Loretta had to
kick his butt.

14:06.321 --> 14:08.688
PRIDE:
Anyway, Patton got a match

14:08.690 --> 14:11.391
on the shell casing fingerprint
from yesterday's shooting.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.725
Enough to find
Stone's real I.D.?

14:12.727 --> 14:14.093
PATTON:
No, he's still a ghost.

14:14.095 --> 14:17.096
But it's enough to connect
Stone to both Javier Garcia

14:17.098 --> 14:19.766
and the FBI agents' murder
from way back when.

14:19.768 --> 14:21.367
And to that Chinese operative

14:21.369 --> 14:24.304
tried to steal
the Navy's ship-activation CPU

14:24.306 --> 14:25.805
a few weeks ago.

14:25.807 --> 14:27.507
Wait, but killing the guy
actually helped the Navy

14:27.509 --> 14:29.008
keep the program alive.

14:29.010 --> 14:30.276
It doesn't make sense.

14:30.278 --> 14:32.912
Hamilton had Garcia killed
to keep his mouth shut,

14:32.914 --> 14:34.747
but then he kills
a Chinese operative,

14:34.749 --> 14:36.582
which turned out
to be a good thing?

14:36.584 --> 14:38.284
It only makes sense
if it's good for Hamilton.

14:38.286 --> 14:39.485
PRIDE:
Exactly, which means

14:39.487 --> 14:41.688
the sooner we figure out
what all this has to do

14:41.690 --> 14:42.956
with the mayor's plans
for Clearwater...

14:42.958 --> 14:44.590
The sooner I get
my damn office back.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.059
And the sooner I get payback,

14:46.061 --> 14:48.428
see Hamilton behind bars
instead of me.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.630
Welcome back, Sonja.

14:52.033 --> 14:53.866
You okay?
SONJA: You tell me.

14:53.868 --> 14:56.502
Word is HQ is still
pretty pissed at us.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.471
Actually, more me than you.

14:58.473 --> 15:03.076
Still, it goes without saying,
if any of you want to bow out...

15:03.078 --> 15:04.978
I think you know us
better than that.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.313
In for a penny, in for a pound.

15:11.886 --> 15:14.053
Which brings us back to Stone
and who his next target is.

15:14.055 --> 15:15.488
PRIDE: Yeah, you able
to narrow it down

15:15.490 --> 15:17.590
to one of the seven
incoming dignitaries?

15:17.592 --> 15:19.325
No, not yet,
but at least we know

15:19.327 --> 15:20.727
what they're doing
in New Orleans.

15:20.729 --> 15:21.861
Yeah, and they're not
incoming anymore,

15:21.863 --> 15:23.062
they're already here.

15:23.064 --> 15:24.530
Apparently for some shindig

15:24.532 --> 15:25.665
at city hall tonight.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.633
I hacked...

15:27.635 --> 15:30.603
I mean, I accidentally
stumbled across

15:30.605 --> 15:33.172
the NOPD and the
FBI communications

15:33.174 --> 15:35.675
coordinating security--
it's big-time.

15:35.677 --> 15:37.543
It's got to be
the big secret, right?

15:37.545 --> 15:38.945
Whatever Hamilton's plan is.

15:38.947 --> 15:40.947
Can we get ears in there?
No way.

15:40.949 --> 15:43.483
All that security?
It's like Fort Knox.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.618
Can we bug one of the guests
before they go in?

15:45.620 --> 15:47.086
Wouldn't make a difference;
they're all gonna

15:47.088 --> 15:48.287
get scanned before they even get

15:48.289 --> 15:49.756
in the building.

15:49.758 --> 15:51.858
Not all of 'em.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.965
All right, look, uh, you know,

15:58.967 --> 16:01.034
either we do this
or we don't, okay?

16:01.036 --> 16:02.535
I got people waiting.

16:04.139 --> 16:05.805
Told you to come alone.

16:05.807 --> 16:08.408
Yeah, I don't go anywhere
without NOPD.

16:08.410 --> 16:09.942
Especially here.

16:09.944 --> 16:11.677
After all,

16:11.679 --> 16:14.213
desperate men
do desperate things.

16:14.215 --> 16:16.249
Frisk him.

16:23.892 --> 16:26.092
You can wait outside.

16:31.199 --> 16:34.167
Now, you know I'm only here
'cause you said you wanted

16:34.169 --> 16:35.868
to save your team's jobs, right?

16:35.870 --> 16:36.608
That's right.

16:36.632 --> 16:38.305
Only one way
that's gonna happen.

16:38.306 --> 16:41.174
And that's if you back
the hell off me, and I mean

16:41.176 --> 16:42.675
all the way off.

16:42.677 --> 16:45.244
All right.
On one condition.

16:45.246 --> 16:47.280
(chuckles):
Condition? Oh, man, no, no.

16:47.282 --> 16:48.381
You don't get
conditions, Dwayne.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.883
All you have to do
is confess

16:50.885 --> 16:54.153
to killing Garcia
and the FBI agents

16:54.155 --> 16:57.123
and the Clearwater pastor
and your connection to Stone.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.092
Oh, man, you are
out of your mind.

16:59.094 --> 17:00.693
You are out of
your damn mind... (shouts)

17:00.695 --> 17:03.062
I'm gonna tear you down, Hamilton.
Hey! Son of a... (shouts)

17:03.064 --> 17:04.204
- I'm gonna connect your sorry ass
- Get in here!

17:04.229 --> 17:05.031
to everything you've done!

17:05.032 --> 17:06.766
- Every murder, every person you hurt!
- Get in here!

17:06.768 --> 17:08.367
And if I can't get
you the needle,

17:08.368 --> 17:09.935
I'm gonna make damn sure
you spend

17:09.938 --> 17:12.839
the rest of your miserable,
corrupt life in prison!

17:15.310 --> 17:17.310
(panting)

17:19.681 --> 17:22.013
Oh...

17:22.016 --> 17:24.450
you are finished, Dwayne.

17:24.452 --> 17:26.685
You are finished in this town,
do you understand?

17:26.688 --> 17:30.123
You and your
whole damn team.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.624
You're done!

17:35.930 --> 17:37.830
Let's get out of here.

17:48.042 --> 17:50.143
(phone beeps)

17:50.145 --> 17:52.612
(line ringing)

17:52.614 --> 17:54.914
Bug's in Hamilton's
coat pocket, Patton.

17:54.916 --> 17:57.316
Copy that, Pride. (Hamilton shouting)
I hear him loud and clear.

17:57.318 --> 17:59.218
And let me tell you,
he is pissed.

17:59.220 --> 18:02.388
So am I.

18:08.663 --> 18:10.830
(siren wailing)

18:12.901 --> 18:15.168
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

18:16.571 --> 18:18.204
MAN:
Sir.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.109
PRIDE (over radio):
All right, talk to me.

18:23.111 --> 18:25.311
It's 15 after.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.513
We only saw six of the
seven potential targets

18:27.515 --> 18:29.615
enter so far, King.

18:29.617 --> 18:31.884
Which means no sign
of the congresswoman yet.

18:31.886 --> 18:33.386
(sirens wailing)

18:33.388 --> 18:36.255
GREGORIO: Whoa, hold on
a second. Stand by.

18:36.257 --> 18:38.524
Here comes another
police escort.

18:41.696 --> 18:44.297
Check that, Pride. We just saw
the congresswoman enter

18:44.299 --> 18:46.432
through a side entrance
on Lafayette.

18:47.702 --> 18:49.602
They're all here.

18:49.604 --> 18:51.837
HAMILTON: So what do you say
we get this show on the road?

18:51.839 --> 18:54.307
You all traveled a long way.
I appreciate that.

18:54.309 --> 18:57.076
So let me make it
worth your while.

18:57.078 --> 18:57.848
Turn it up.

18:57.872 --> 18:59.146
Uh, I know it's been
a long, arduous process,

18:59.147 --> 19:02.148
but, um, it's my hope,
this evening,

19:02.150 --> 19:04.884
to convince those of you
who are still holding out--

19:04.886 --> 19:06.919
uh, I'm not gonna name
any names, now,

19:06.921 --> 19:08.254
(clears throat)
Congresswoman--

19:08.256 --> 19:11.557
uh, to convince you
once and for all

19:11.559 --> 19:14.961
why Clearwater, why New Orleans

19:14.963 --> 19:18.831
is the best candidate
for the first naval shipyards

19:18.833 --> 19:20.800
to be built in our country
in decades.

19:20.802 --> 19:22.134
Come on, come on
around here.

19:22.136 --> 19:23.169
Yeah, that's right.

19:23.171 --> 19:24.804
Whoa.
HAMILTON: See for yourself.

19:24.806 --> 19:25.972
Ah, she's a beauty, isn't she?

19:25.974 --> 19:28.407
Now, as you know, unlike

19:28.409 --> 19:31.711
the Georgia option, Clearwater
is all but shovel-ready.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.279
And on top of that,

19:33.281 --> 19:36.215
we offer easy Gulf
and Panama Canal access.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.151
We got plenty of slips
for stealth destroyers

19:39.153 --> 19:41.320
and nuclear subs and whatnot.

19:41.322 --> 19:44.223
And we also have enough
land and infrastructure

19:44.225 --> 19:45.324
to build high-tech centers--

19:45.326 --> 19:46.859
centers which will
allow the Navy

19:46.861 --> 19:49.595
to open the first
ship-activation centers

19:49.597 --> 19:51.097
east of San Diego.

19:51.099 --> 19:53.232
Something D.O.D.
has long coveted.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.734
Guess that answers
that question.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.236
This is bigger than I thought.
THOMPKINS: So, out of curiosity,

19:57.238 --> 19:58.904
how many people would
your shipyard employ?

19:58.906 --> 20:00.706
Well, I'm actually glad that
you asked that, Admiral,

20:00.708 --> 20:04.110
because our research says
that 11,000

20:04.112 --> 20:06.178
full and part-time jobs
will be created,

20:06.180 --> 20:08.180
both civilian and military.

20:08.182 --> 20:09.582
Which would be
a much-needed boon

20:09.584 --> 20:11.751
to both New Orleans
and Louisiana, I imagine.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.219
And great press for the Navy.

20:13.221 --> 20:15.288
Great press for you, too,
Mr. Mayor.

20:15.290 --> 20:16.789
As well as a boon

20:16.791 --> 20:18.457
to whatever political
aspirations you may have.

20:18.459 --> 20:21.427
Might as well start calling
him Governor Hamilton now.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.362
(scoffs)
Over Pride's dead body.

20:23.364 --> 20:24.764
HAMILTON:
No, no, no.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.098
Th-This is not about me,
Congresswoman.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.800
It's not about me.

20:27.802 --> 20:30.303
Folks around here have been
ignored by D.C. for too long.

20:30.305 --> 20:31.837
We're still recovering
from Katrina.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.439
Now, this will help
New Orleans.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.940
I make no bones
about that.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.777
But it will also help America
and the Navy, too.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.212
How does it help
the residents of Clearwater?

20:40.214 --> 20:42.315
Uh, s-sorry?

20:42.317 --> 20:44.483
The latest report
shows there are at least

20:44.485 --> 20:46.686
2,000 people still living there.
Right.

20:46.688 --> 20:47.987
Well, we will relocate them.

20:47.989 --> 20:49.155
Affordable housing
has already been designed

20:49.157 --> 20:50.122
into the entire process.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.158
But my point is...
Yes.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.559
...they're still there.

20:54.696 --> 20:56.262
You want to break ground
next month,

20:56.264 --> 20:58.497
but people are still living
on the very site.

20:58.499 --> 21:00.099
It's not even cleared.

21:01.736 --> 21:03.336
HAMILTON: All right, look,
we're getting down

21:03.338 --> 21:05.137
to the wire here, Congresswoman.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.540
We know that you are
the lone holdout here.

21:07.542 --> 21:10.009
But since you're the head of
the Armed Services Committee,

21:10.011 --> 21:13.446
we also know that your vote
holds great sway.

21:13.448 --> 21:16.182
So is there anything
I can do or say

21:16.184 --> 21:18.351
to convince you
before the final vote?

21:18.353 --> 21:20.786
No.

21:20.788 --> 21:23.222
Because I still think
the Georgia site's

21:23.224 --> 21:25.057
a better alternative.

21:27.929 --> 21:30.796
Yeah. Excuse me.

21:36.871 --> 21:38.871
HAMILTON: Don't worry about it.
She'll come around,

21:38.873 --> 21:39.939
one way or the other.

21:39.941 --> 21:41.874
What do you think, King?

21:41.876 --> 21:43.909
I think Hamilton will do
anything to get that shipyard.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.811
Which means
that poor congresswoman

21:45.813 --> 21:47.947
is obviously
Stone's next target.

21:47.949 --> 21:49.115
Question is: how do we save her?

21:49.117 --> 21:50.516
We don't even know
where Stone is

21:50.518 --> 21:52.618
or when and where
he's planning the hit.

21:52.620 --> 21:53.986
Can't exactly warn her.

21:53.988 --> 21:55.321
We're not even supposed
to know about this.

21:55.323 --> 21:57.556
Hell, we're not even supposed
to be on the case.

21:57.558 --> 21:58.657
PRIDE:
We'd better figure it out,

21:58.659 --> 22:00.860
because saving her
stops Hamilton,

22:00.862 --> 22:02.795
and that's all that matters.

22:15.651 --> 22:16.669
Wait, wait, you two

22:16.670 --> 22:19.704
are supposed to be watching
the congresswoman!

22:19.706 --> 22:21.172
We handed it off
to Lasalle and Percy.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.407
They're there,
don't worry.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.078
Sorry.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.949
Did you get any sleep?

22:30.951 --> 22:33.017
No, not much.
We're no further along

22:33.019 --> 22:35.053
knowing when or where
Stone's gonna strike

22:35.055 --> 22:36.287
than we were last night.

22:36.289 --> 22:38.723
Patton checked
surveillance cameras,

22:38.725 --> 22:40.792
he's-he's used facial
recognition, nothing.

22:41.158 --> 22:42.891
She's safe for
now. It's okay.

22:42.893 --> 22:45.093
Yeah, she's in her room,
Capitol Police are guarding her.

22:45.095 --> 22:46.995
Stone's not gonna make his move
until she leaves.

22:46.997 --> 22:47.416
How do you know?

22:47.440 --> 22:48.664
'Cause he's not
gonna take her out

22:48.665 --> 22:49.998
and make it look like a hit.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Be too easy
for authorities

22:52.002 --> 22:55.137
to connect it to the shipyard
vote, maybe even to Hamilton.

22:55.139 --> 22:58.440
Right. Right, so they...

22:58.442 --> 22:59.975
make it look like an accident.

22:59.977 --> 23:01.977
GREGORIO: Exactly.
It's probably a restaurant

23:01.979 --> 23:03.245
based on the
blueprints and maps.

23:03.247 --> 23:04.880
We just got to
figure out which one.

23:04.882 --> 23:06.348
Yeah, it's got to be
a seafood restaurant

23:06.350 --> 23:07.849
'cause of that fish tank,
which, by the way,

23:07.851 --> 23:09.651
I've been working on
in my old lab.

23:09.653 --> 23:12.154
Seems like they were cultivating
some kind of a fungus inside.

23:12.156 --> 23:13.588
I don't know.
I'm running tests right now.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.323
Yeah, well, go see
if anything's turned up.

23:16.193 --> 23:17.559
Go!

23:22.633 --> 23:26.001
Protect the congresswoman,
catch Stone in the act,

23:26.003 --> 23:28.336
use him to bust Hamilton.

23:28.338 --> 23:30.005
We got this, Pride.

23:30.007 --> 23:31.206
Save the day, save your badge.

23:31.208 --> 23:34.176
I don't care about my badge.

23:39.950 --> 23:41.249
Where-where are you going?

23:41.251 --> 23:43.318
To warn the congresswoman;
she needs to know.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.387
What are you gonna tell her?
We don't have any proof.

23:45.389 --> 23:48.456
So far, we don't have anything.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.559
Pride!

23:52.262 --> 23:54.863
HAMILTON: <i>I just want to know</i>
<i>what the time frame is.</i>

23:54.865 --> 23:56.565
<i>Just want to be prepared,</i>
<i>that's all.</i>

23:56.567 --> 23:57.766
Prepared for what?

23:57.768 --> 23:59.167
HAMILTON: Prepared for what?
What do you think?

23:59.169 --> 24:00.468
Media's gonna want answers.

24:00.470 --> 24:03.171
I-I'm the one that invited her
to come here, remember?

24:03.173 --> 24:05.507
Just tell them New Orleans
is a dangerous town.

24:05.509 --> 24:07.509
Don't be smug with me.

24:07.511 --> 24:09.311
Just answer my question.

24:09.313 --> 24:11.313
Couple hours,
it'll be done.

24:11.315 --> 24:12.347
Couple hours?

24:12.349 --> 24:14.449
That soon?

24:14.451 --> 24:16.084
Hey, guys, can I...
(silenced gunshot)

24:16.086 --> 24:17.219
Wh-What was that?

24:17.221 --> 24:18.086
What happened?

24:18.088 --> 24:20.488
Don't worry about it.

24:20.490 --> 24:22.824
Right now,
the bigger issue is Pride.

24:22.826 --> 24:24.659
He needs to be dealt with.

24:24.661 --> 24:26.261
(phone beeps)

24:31.768 --> 24:34.102
Wonder what the record is
for shortest stint

24:34.104 --> 24:36.471
as an NCIS field agent.

24:36.473 --> 24:37.939
Always wanted to be
the best at something.

24:37.941 --> 24:39.574
I kind of wish
it wasn't that.

24:39.576 --> 24:41.376
Yeah, well, at least
you'll be free.

24:41.378 --> 24:42.577
Broke but free.

24:42.579 --> 24:43.945
Me?

24:43.947 --> 24:45.580
I'm looking at five to ten hard,

24:45.582 --> 24:47.983
and undoubtedly
with a bunk mate named Bubba.

24:47.985 --> 24:49.684
Yeah, you're right.
You're way more screwed.

24:49.686 --> 24:52.187
Any luck tapping into
the congresswoman's itinerary?

24:52.189 --> 24:54.022
No offense,
but your old lab computers

24:54.024 --> 24:56.491
are not exactly set up
for a Triple P hacking.

24:56.493 --> 24:58.126
That's not cool.

24:58.128 --> 24:59.594
Man, don't go
getting sensitive.

24:59.596 --> 25:00.862
Man, it's not personal.

25:00.864 --> 25:02.564
No, no, it's not that.
It's this.

25:02.566 --> 25:03.498
What is it?

25:03.500 --> 25:04.633
SEBASTIAN:
<i>Karenia brevis.</i>

25:04.635 --> 25:05.900
Who is that?

25:05.902 --> 25:07.335
No, it's not a who,
it's an algae.

25:07.337 --> 25:09.204
I just found trace elements
of it in the fish tank.

25:09.206 --> 25:10.338
At first I
thought it was

25:10.340 --> 25:11.873
a fungus, but...

25:11.875 --> 25:13.775
I take it it isn't?

25:13.777 --> 25:15.010
No, you ever hear
of red tide?

25:15.012 --> 25:16.344
You know, a-a
microscopic algae

25:16.346 --> 25:17.412
that sometimes grows in
oysters in the Mississippi?

25:17.414 --> 25:19.748
Yeah, that stuff is deadly,
isn't it?

25:19.750 --> 25:21.983
Yeah, very.

25:27.991 --> 25:30.058
(sighs)
Anything happening?

25:30.060 --> 25:31.259
No, congresswoman's
still inside,

25:31.261 --> 25:33.261
safe and sound, I hope.

25:33.263 --> 25:34.829
Caramel Macchiato.

25:34.831 --> 25:36.031
Extra shot, right?

25:36.033 --> 25:37.432
Thank you.

25:37.434 --> 25:40.068
What's Pride doing here?

25:40.070 --> 25:42.103
(trolley bell dinging)

25:43.407 --> 25:44.806
I'll get your keys
for you, sir.

25:44.808 --> 25:47.309
Just leave it there.

25:47.311 --> 25:49.311
NCIS.

25:49.313 --> 25:50.545
I need to speak with the--

25:50.547 --> 25:52.147
Congresswoman.

25:52.149 --> 25:54.115
Special Agent Pride, NCIS.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.750
Sorry to bother you,
but it's important.

25:55.752 --> 25:57.252
What's this about?

25:57.254 --> 26:00.655
It's about the shipyard
and Mayor Hamilton.

26:00.657 --> 26:03.825
I'll be right there.

26:05.629 --> 26:08.363
Why does NCIS know
about the shipyard?

26:08.365 --> 26:10.665
NCIS doesn't, I do.

26:10.667 --> 26:13.168
I can't explain why
I know what I know,

26:13.170 --> 26:17.172
but I have to tell you, Hamilton
is not gonna let you vote.

26:17.174 --> 26:18.306
He's gonna stop you.

26:18.308 --> 26:20.542
Stop me?
How's he going to stop me?

26:23.146 --> 26:25.146
He's gonna try and kill you.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.715
What?

26:26.717 --> 26:27.916
That's ridiculous.

26:27.918 --> 26:30.418
No, no, listen.

26:31.355 --> 26:32.987
I'm sorry, but pl-please.

26:32.989 --> 26:35.323
You got to believe me.

26:35.325 --> 26:37.392
Me and my team have been
tracking a hit squad,

26:37.394 --> 26:39.461
and we have every
reason to believe

26:39.463 --> 26:40.695
they're connected to Hamilton

26:40.697 --> 26:42.230
and that you're
their next target.

26:42.232 --> 26:43.298
Do you have proof of this?

26:43.300 --> 26:45.400
No, not exactly, no.

26:45.402 --> 26:48.136
But I'm-I'm telling you,
I know Hamilton,

26:48.138 --> 26:49.771
and he'll do anything
to keep you from voting.

26:49.773 --> 26:51.539
Or maybe you're just
trying to scare me.

26:51.541 --> 26:53.475
I'm-I'm sorry?
Don't think I don't know

26:53.477 --> 26:55.310
how this town of yours works,
Agent Pride.

26:55.312 --> 26:57.846
New Orleans has a long
history of corrupt officials.

26:57.848 --> 27:00.348
This looks like
just another example.

27:00.350 --> 27:02.083
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

27:02.085 --> 27:03.551
You tell your
mayor friend...

27:03.553 --> 27:05.153
He's not my friend.

27:05.155 --> 27:07.589
...I will not be intimidated
by you or anybody else.

27:07.591 --> 27:09.391
That shipyard
will never be

27:09.393 --> 27:11.860
built in Clearwater, ever.

27:11.862 --> 27:13.762
Good day.

27:14.865 --> 27:16.145
Look, Congresswoman, I'm just...

27:19.436 --> 27:21.736
(siren wailing)

27:31.782 --> 27:33.982
(cell phones chime)

27:51.067 --> 27:52.734
He's got the
congresswoman's itinerary.

27:52.736 --> 27:54.969
Yeah, and she's headed to
lunch with Admiral Thompkins

27:54.971 --> 27:58.206
at Beaux's Oyster Bar,
corner restaurant.

27:58.208 --> 27:59.507
LASALLE: Plus,
Sebastian thinks he knows

27:59.509 --> 28:00.842

make the hit

(tires screeching)

28:07.451 --> 28:10.518

Hello, Admiral.

28:18.295 --> 28:20.929

Good to see you. Thank you.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.307

REPORTER:
Now, witnesses say the driver,

29:48.315 --> 29:50.282
identified as the same
federal agent

29:50.643 --> 29:52.576
who was chastised by the mayor

29:52.578 --> 29:54.845
for similar reckless action
just two days ago,

29:54.847 --> 29:58.449
intentionally drove his car into
the patio filled with diners.

29:58.451 --> 30:00.451
Now, fortunately,
nobody was injured.

30:00.453 --> 30:01.552
However,
the investigation into...

30:01.554 --> 30:03.587
LASALLE:
That's some bull.

30:03.589 --> 30:05.523
They ain't got a clue
of what was going on.

30:05.525 --> 30:07.424
King saved that
woman's life.

30:07.426 --> 30:08.859
SONJA: Problem is,
nobody knows.

30:08.861 --> 30:10.094
Yeah, not even
the congresswoman.

30:10.096 --> 30:11.262
SEBASTIAN:
Tammy's right.

30:11.264 --> 30:12.763
I mean, even if
they test those oysters,

30:12.765 --> 30:14.465
the red tide will look like
it was naturally occurring.

30:14.467 --> 30:16.300
There's no way anybody would
think that it was intentional.

30:16.302 --> 30:17.501
But that's Stone's play,

30:17.503 --> 30:19.470
to make it look
like an accident.

30:19.472 --> 30:21.505
Yeah, which means King's a hero,
and the media's trying

30:21.507 --> 30:23.440
to spin it like
he's some crazed maniac.

30:23.442 --> 30:25.543
You mean Hamilton's
trying to spin it.

30:25.545 --> 30:28.445
HQ can't really blame him for
doing the right thing, can they?

30:28.447 --> 30:30.748
They don't know he's doing
the right thing. We don't even

30:30.750 --> 30:31.815
have enough proof;
besides, we're not even

30:31.817 --> 30:33.817
supposed to be
on this case anymore.

30:33.819 --> 30:35.653
So, what do you think
is gonna happen?

30:35.655 --> 30:38.622
They're suspending us.

30:38.624 --> 30:41.492
Pending further review,
deputy director's ordered us

30:41.494 --> 30:45.296
to stand down, cease and desist
all NCIS activities.

30:45.298 --> 30:47.331
(chuckles):
Wait. That's not right.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.700
Yeah, if it wasn't for you, that
congresswoman would be dead.

30:49.702 --> 30:51.135
She's still in danger, too.

30:51.137 --> 30:52.570
Which means,
if we don't do something...

30:52.572 --> 30:55.873
There is no “we” anymore,
all right?

30:55.875 --> 30:59.176
At least not until
HQ figures it out.

30:59.178 --> 31:02.646

31:02.648 --> 31:04.315
“we” aren't doing anything.

How'd Pride save her?

exactly what we were doing,

31:41.320 --> 31:42.987

31:42.989 --> 31:45.122
Did you tell him? You tell him
when you met him in his bar?

31:45.124 --> 31:47.258
Course I didn't!
Why would I do that?

31:47.260 --> 31:50.127
And besides,
I don't know how and when.

31:50.129 --> 31:51.695
That's supposed to be your job,

31:51.697 --> 31:53.397

you been screwing up so much

31:53.399 --> 31:54.932

no other choice anymore.

31:54.934 --> 31:56.934
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- It means that

31:56.936 --> 31:58.202
I'm shutting it down,
that's what it means.

31:58.204 --> 31:59.837

31:59.839 --> 32:01.538

out of control

39:48.970 --> 39:51.404
It's on me.

39:54.776 --> 39:56.676
Enjoy.

40:06.221 --> 40:08.655
♪ ♪

40:27.609 --> 40:29.609
LASALLE:
I'm telling you,

40:29.611 --> 40:31.044
it's not him.

40:31.046 --> 40:32.312
Okay, fine.

40:32.314 --> 40:33.746
But what if it is?
It's not.

40:33.748 --> 40:35.949
It can't be.
SONJA: Then why was

40:35.951 --> 40:37.517
Pride's gun and badge
on the body, huh?

40:37.519 --> 40:38.618
How do you explain that?

40:38.620 --> 40:40.353
I don't know,
all right?

40:40.355 --> 40:43.122
I... It just can't be him.

40:43.124 --> 40:45.558
Because if it is, then...
All right, let's just...

40:45.560 --> 40:48.228
You know, this is, this is
hard for all of us, obviously,

40:48.230 --> 40:51.364
and-and, you know, we just
got to... we just got to wait.

40:56.338 --> 40:58.004
She's coming.

41:06.014 --> 41:08.214
It's not Pride.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.849
What?

41:09.851 --> 41:11.084
Thank God.

41:16.458 --> 41:17.924
Are you sure?

41:17.926 --> 41:21.094
DNA didn't come close
to matching.

41:21.096 --> 41:23.196
I don't know
who the hell that is,

41:23.198 --> 41:24.998
but I know it's not Pride.

41:26.034 --> 41:27.433
Okay, but wait.

41:27.435 --> 41:29.669
Do you think Pride
put his badge and gun

41:29.671 --> 41:31.104
on the body intentionally?

41:32.540 --> 41:33.973
Had to.

41:33.975 --> 41:36.209
Yeah, but why?

41:36.211 --> 41:38.678
Maybe he wanted us to know
that he was still alive.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.947
I mean, he had to know that
Doc was gonna check, right?

41:40.949 --> 41:42.482
Well, that can't be the only
reason; otherwise he would've

41:42.484 --> 41:43.850
shown up already,
let everyone else

41:43.852 --> 41:45.685
know he's still alive.

41:48.156 --> 41:51.524
Maybe he wants everyone else
to think he's dead.

41:53.194 --> 41:55.895
Yeah. Especially Hamilton.

41:58.833 --> 42:01.034
(train horn blowing)

42:12.219 --> 42:16.221
I just wanted to make sure
you were still breathing.
