00:01.168 --> 00:02.586
<i>Okay, let's do this thing.</i>

00:02.586 --> 00:04.839
<i>As you know,</i>

00:02.586 --> 00:04.839
<i>Jane married Michael,</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:06.173
<i>but then he was shot.</i>

00:06.173 --> 00:07.466
<i>And even though he recovered,</i>

00:07.466 --> 00:09.635
<i>he didn't pass</i>

00:07.466 --> 00:09.635
<i>the physical for work,</i>

00:09.635 --> 00:11.178
<i>so he couldn't be</i>

00:09.635 --> 00:11.178
<i>a detective anymore.</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:13.806
<i>Bright side,</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:13.806
<i>he'd settled on a new career.</i>

00:13.806 --> 00:16.391
How about a lawyer?

00:13.806 --> 00:16.391
<i>Exciting, huh?</i>

00:16.391 --> 00:19.603
<i>Also exciting, Jane's father,</i>

00:16.391 --> 00:19.603
<i>Rogelio, met a matchmaker,</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:21.396
<i>only he made a match</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:21.396
<i>with her...</i>

00:21.396 --> 00:22.773
<i>or rather,</i>

00:21.396 --> 00:22.773
<i>a business arrangement.</i>

00:22.773 --> 00:24.692
Not to date,

00:22.773 --> 00:24.692
just to have a baby with.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.778
NARRATOR:

00:24.692 --> 00:27.778
<i>But then he developed</i>

00:24.692 --> 00:27.778
<i>real feelings for Darci,</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:29.905
<i>which was a big old no-no.</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:29.905
But you got to get over it

00:29.905 --> 00:31.365
if you want to have

00:29.905 --> 00:31.365
a baby with me.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.283
<i>And speaking</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.283
<i>of complicated relationships,</i>

00:33.283 --> 00:35.995
<i>Xo is back together</i>

00:33.283 --> 00:35.995
<i>with her old flame, Bruce.</i>

00:35.995 --> 00:38.789
<i>Oh, and Jane's baby daddy,</i>

00:35.995 --> 00:38.789
<i>Rafael,</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:40.499
<i>he was dating Jane's cousin,</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:40.499
<i>Catalina,</i>

00:40.499 --> 00:42.584
<i>who Jane thought</i>

00:40.499 --> 00:42.584
<i>was pretty damn shady.</i>

00:42.584 --> 00:45.546
<i>But she wasn't as shady as</i>

00:42.584 --> 00:45.546
<i>Petra's twin sister, Anezka.</i>

00:45.546 --> 00:48.883
<i>You recall Anezka paralyzed</i>

00:45.546 --> 00:48.883
<i>Petra and then took her place,</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:52.970
<i>and to make matters worse, she</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:52.970
<i>started dating Scott as Petra.</i>

00:52.970 --> 00:55.472
<i>I know! Traumatic, right?</i>

00:55.472 --> 00:59.768
<i>So, when Petra finally woke up,</i>

00:55.472 --> 00:59.768
<i>well... she was pissed.</i>

00:59.768 --> 01:02.855
I was freaking paralyzed

00:59.768 --> 01:02.855
and nobody even noticed.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.356
<i>Oh, and one last thing...</i>

01:04.356 --> 01:05.524
<i>Rafael recently found out</i>

01:05.524 --> 01:07.568
<i>he wasn't really a Solano,</i>

01:07.568 --> 01:10.278
<i>and then he discovered an</i>

01:07.568 --> 01:10.278
<i>addendum to his father's will,</i>

01:10.278 --> 01:12.531
<i>leaving everything</i>

01:10.278 --> 01:12.531
<i>to his biological children,</i>

01:12.531 --> 01:14.491
<i>which means if that will</i>

01:12.531 --> 01:14.491
<i>comes to light...</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:17.494
<i>well, Rafael stands</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:17.494
<i>to lose a lot...</i>

01:17.494 --> 01:19.413
<i>of money, that is.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.957
<i>Which, my friends,</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.957
<i>is where we left off.</i>

01:21.957 --> 01:25.460
<i>It should be noted that</i>

01:21.957 --> 01:25.460
<i>Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:27.170
<i>knew her husband, well,</i>

01:27.170 --> 01:28.756
<i>like she knew herself.</i>

01:28.756 --> 01:31.550
The Law Offices

01:28.756 --> 01:31.550
of Michael Cordero Jr.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.260
I like the sound of that.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.304
<i>So, she knew when</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:36.304
<i>he decided to be a lawyer,</i>

01:36.304 --> 01:38.891
<i>well, there was</i>

01:36.304 --> 01:38.891
<i>no stopping him...</i>

01:38.891 --> 01:41.685
MICHAEL:

01:38.891 --> 01:41.685
<i>Though the evidence against the</i>

01:38.891 --> 01:41.685
<i>defendant is circumstantial,</i>

01:41.685 --> 01:43.604
it does fit a pattern

01:41.685 --> 01:43.604
of behavior, Your Honor.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.731
NARRATOR:<i> </i>

01:43.604 --> 01:45.731
<i>...from pretending</i>

01:43.604 --> 01:45.731
<i>he already was one.</i>

01:45.731 --> 01:48.275
Objection!

01:45.731 --> 01:48.275
Your Honor,

01:48.275 --> 01:49.860
the defendant is

01:48.275 --> 01:49.860
way too cute,

01:49.860 --> 01:52.487
and the prosecution

01:49.860 --> 01:52.487
is way too sexy.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.032
Objection sustained.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.032
High fives.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.450
So...

01:56.450 --> 01:57.993
Good news and bad

01:56.450 --> 01:57.993
news. Good news,

01:57.993 --> 02:00.161
you can take the LSAT

01:57.993 --> 02:00.161
at the end of this month.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.163
Bad news, I got to take the LSAT

02:00.161 --> 02:02.163
at the end of the month

02:02.163 --> 02:03.958
and I suck at tests.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.167
Standardized testing is about

02:03.958 --> 02:06.167
learning the rules, the tricks.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.462
You're trying to work in your

02:06.167 --> 02:08.462
SAT scores again, aren't you?

02:08.462 --> 02:10.422
No...

02:10.422 --> 02:11.757
but, Mateo,

02:11.757 --> 02:13.092
Mommy did really well.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.384
Let me help you.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.512
No, no way.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.512
Recipe for disaster.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.139
I just think

02:17.512 --> 02:19.139
it'd be smarter for us

02:19.139 --> 02:20.975
to separate church and state,

02:19.139 --> 02:20.975
you know?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.975
Yeah.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.601
You're probably right.

02:22.601 --> 02:23.644
But maybe you can make me

02:23.644 --> 02:24.686
one of your patented calendars.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.063
NARRATOR:

02:24.686 --> 02:26.063
<i>And, friends,</i>

02:26.063 --> 02:27.689
<i>it was the most romantic thing</i>

02:27.689 --> 02:29.316
<i>he could have said.</i>

02:29.316 --> 02:31.318
It just so happens that

02:29.316 --> 02:31.318
I'm making myself one

02:31.318 --> 02:32.569
to finish my thesis.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.071
Add me in.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.239
( gasps )

02:34.071 --> 02:36.239
I'd love to.

02:36.239 --> 02:39.076
Good... and schedule in

02:36.239 --> 02:39.076
lots of sex.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.452
<i>Which she did,</i>

02:39.076 --> 02:40.452
<i>for the record...</i>

02:40.452 --> 02:42.121
Mmm.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.581
<i>...as a reward incentive</i>

02:42.121 --> 02:44.581
<i>for lots and lots of studying.</i>

02:44.581 --> 02:47.918
<i>And I have to say, so far,</i>

02:44.581 --> 02:47.918
<i>separating church and state</i>

02:47.918 --> 02:49.044
<i>has proved highly productive...</i>

02:49.044 --> 02:51.170
( laughs )

02:49.044 --> 02:51.170
I can't believe it.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.048
I actually finished a draft

02:51.170 --> 02:53.048
of my novel.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.466
<i>...for church, anyway.</i>

02:54.466 --> 02:56.343
Congrats, babe.

02:56.343 --> 03:00.097
<i>State... has taken</i>

02:56.343 --> 03:00.097
<i>a more laid-back approach,</i>

03:00.097 --> 03:02.808
<i>which is totally stressing</i>

03:00.097 --> 03:02.808
<i>church out.</i>

03:02.808 --> 03:04.018
So, what's on the agenda today?

03:04.018 --> 03:06.645
Uh, same.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.645
Just hitting the books.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.563
Oh, did I tell you

03:08.563 --> 03:09.857
I got an e-mail confirming

03:08.563 --> 03:09.857
my interview

03:09.857 --> 03:11.190
with Putnam Law School

03:09.857 --> 03:11.190
on Wednesday?

03:11.190 --> 03:12.985
What? No.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.778
You never mentioned.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.778
No! Run.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.321
Run. Come on.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.532
Michael,

03:16.321 --> 03:18.532
Putnam's the ideal law school.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.783
It's one of the good ones.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.368
It's cheaper

03:19.783 --> 03:21.368
and close to where we live.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.621
I know, that's why

03:21.368 --> 03:24.621
I'm busting my butt studying.

03:24.621 --> 03:29.043
The-- The game helps me

03:24.621 --> 03:29.043
relax and focus.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.753
Weren't you gonna drop

03:29.043 --> 03:31.753
your novel off with your mom?

NARRATOR:<i> </i>

03:34.798 --> 03:37.509
<i>Which, for the record, is</i>

03:34.798 --> 03:37.509

03:37.509 --> 03:39.260
Hey, Dad.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.260
Where's Mom?

03:39.260 --> 03:40.387
I want to give her my...

03:41.930 --> 03:43.473
bracelet. Mom...

03:43.473 --> 03:45.517
wanted to borrow it.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.517
She was running late

03:45.517 --> 03:46.810
coming back from Bruce's.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.228
Shoot, I can't wait.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.646
( in Spanish ):

03:48.228 --> 03:49.646
I'll give her the bracelet.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.814
(in English):

03:49.646 --> 03:50.814
I can't wait, either.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.024
ALBA (in Spanish):

03:50.814 --> 03:52.024
Mm-hmm.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.274
You could have

03:52.024 --> 03:53.274
fooled me,

He's been here for

03:53.274 --> 03:54.735
two hours.

Which you told me about

03:59.073 --> 04:01.867
two hours ago.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.911
Okay, to be honest,

04:01.867 --> 04:03.911
I'm also here to soak in

04:03.911 --> 04:06.788
all of these lovely

04:03.911 --> 04:06.788
family vibes

04:06.788 --> 04:07.956
before I see Darci again.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.499
Is it time?

04:09.499 --> 04:10.876
( gasps )

04:10.876 --> 04:13.087
Why didn't you tell me

04:10.876 --> 04:13.087
that two hours ago?

<i>To explain:</i>

Oh, my!

04:22.221 --> 04:24.765
These three weeks apart

04:22.221 --> 04:24.765
were just what I needed.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.893
Whenever my feelings for her

04:24.765 --> 04:27.893
would... arise,

04:27.893 --> 04:29.061
I tamped them down

04:29.061 --> 04:30.395
and reminded myself

04:30.395 --> 04:32.022
what I'm fighting for:

04:32.022 --> 04:35.109
our potential child.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.818
Dad, what is that?

Yeah. I'm not stressed.

Mateo! Don't put that rock

05:26.118 --> 05:29.037
in your mouth!

05:34.835 --> 05:36.962
( keys clacking )

05:38.421 --> 05:40.132
RAFAEL:

05:38.421 --> 05:40.132
<i>A sentence?</i>

05:40.132 --> 05:42.843
I mean, the grammar was

05:40.132 --> 05:42.843
all over the place, but yes.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.553
Huh. Should we check in

05:42.843 --> 05:45.553
with Dr. Garcia?

05:45.553 --> 05:48.015
If you think so.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.850
You already made

05:48.015 --> 05:49.850
an appointment.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.559
11:30 tomorrow.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.559
Mm-hmm.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.562
Come on, Mateo, let's go

05:51.559 --> 05:54.562
play with your sisters.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.772
Have fun,

05:55.772 --> 05:57.316
Mr. Sweetface.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.316
Bye!

05:57.316 --> 05:59.400
Oh-ho.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.402
So, where's Cat?

06:01.402 --> 06:04.614
The days when I have three kids

06:01.402 --> 06:04.614
aren't really her speed.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.783
Gotcha.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.783
NARRATOR:<i> I'll remind you,</i>

06:06.783 --> 06:08.952
<i>Catalina isn't really</i>

06:06.783 --> 06:08.952
<i>Jane's speed these days.</i>

06:08.952 --> 06:12.080
But since you asked...

06:08.952 --> 06:12.080
I'm gonna end things with her.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.915
Oh, really?

06:13.915 --> 06:15.834
Stop pretending--

06:13.915 --> 06:15.834
you're obviously happy.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.169
I'm not.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.629
Okay, fine, I'm a little happy.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.797
Unless you're sad.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.132
I'm fine.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.134
I just don't need

06:22.132 --> 06:24.134
the distraction right now.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.637
Actually, there's,

06:24.134 --> 06:27.637
um, something else

06:27.637 --> 06:29.723
I wanted to tell you.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.600
A few weeks ago,

06:29.723 --> 06:32.600
I found an addendum

06:32.600 --> 06:34.393
to my father's will,

06:34.393 --> 06:35.854
and I've decided to probate it.

06:35.854 --> 06:39.524
I'm meeting with my lawyer

06:35.854 --> 06:39.524
on Friday, and...

06:39.524 --> 06:43.362
you know, after that,

06:39.524 --> 06:43.362
things could change for me.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.863
Financially.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.156
Substantially.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.785
Whatever happens,

06:48.283 --> 06:50.785
you'll be fine.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.288
We'll all be fine.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.415
RAFAEL (over speaker):

06:53.288 --> 06:56.415
<i>Thanks. That means a lot to me.</i>

06:57.792 --> 06:59.002
NARRATOR:

06:57.792 --> 06:59.002
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

06:59.002 --> 07:01.462
Someone<i> doesn't look fine.</i>

07:01.462 --> 07:03.757
<i>But</i> she<i> sure does.</i>

07:08.303 --> 07:10.680
Ah! Petra, darling!

07:11.556 --> 07:13.141
<i>To catch you up,</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:15.394
<i>these two first met</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:15.394
<i>about three weeks ago.</i>

07:15.394 --> 07:18.063
Hello, there. I'm Catalina,

07:15.394 --> 07:18.063
and I just thought

07:18.063 --> 07:20.941
I should introduce myself,

07:18.063 --> 07:20.941
because I'm dating Rafael<i> and...</i>

07:20.941 --> 07:23.277
redesigning the hotel menu!

07:23.277 --> 07:24.986
( laughs )

07:23.277 --> 07:24.986
Anything else?

07:24.986 --> 07:27.281
I'm also Jane's cousin.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.741
Oh. You went shopping

07:27.281 --> 07:29.741
on Ocean Drive.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.993
( laughs ):

07:29.741 --> 07:31.993
Oh, no,

07:29.741 --> 07:31.993
I'm not a hundred!

07:31.993 --> 07:33.870
I love your watch.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.163
<i>Trés chic.</i>

07:35.163 --> 07:38.750
Mm. So, I have

07:35.163 --> 07:38.750
a proposition for you.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.501
Sexual?

07:40.501 --> 07:42.170
Financial.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.714
( laughs ):

07:42.170 --> 07:44.714
Oh, what makes

07:42.170 --> 07:44.714
you think I need money?

07:44.714 --> 07:47.508
I Googled your ex-husband.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.011
Oh, please, there's no other

07:47.508 --> 07:50.011
reason you'd marry that guy.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.097
Trust me, I'd know.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.391
( cash register rings )

07:54.391 --> 07:57.102
So, Rafael's ending

07:54.391 --> 07:57.102
things with you.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.020
And Jane couldn't be

07:57.102 --> 07:59.020
happier about it.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.648
And clearly, you're trying

08:01.648 --> 08:03.691
to manipulate me.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.069
Oh, I... absolutely am.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.946
You see, we're alike,

08:06.069 --> 08:07.946
you and I,

08:07.946 --> 08:10.031
so I know an opportunist

08:07.946 --> 08:10.031
when I see one.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.699
And if a situation's

08:10.031 --> 08:11.699
not working,

08:11.699 --> 08:13.743
you might as well see what

08:11.699 --> 08:13.743
you can get out of it, hmm?

08:13.743 --> 08:16.079
Well, here's what you can get.

08:16.079 --> 08:19.958
$10,000. And all you have to do

08:16.079 --> 08:19.958
is take Rafael away

08:19.958 --> 08:21.209
for one night.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.545
( bell dings, doors open )

08:24.545 --> 08:26.631
I'll think about it.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.884
NARRATOR:

08:28.216 --> 08:29.884
<i>Yeah,</i> she's<i> a hard one to read.</i>

08:29.884 --> 08:31.636
JANE:

08:29.884 --> 08:31.636
<i>Promise you'll read it soon.</i>

08:31.636 --> 08:33.638
I just need to know

08:31.636 --> 08:33.638
if I can give it to Abuela.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.182
NARRATOR:

08:33.638 --> 08:35.182
<i>You'll recall Jane's novel is</i>

08:35.182 --> 08:37.725
<i>loosely based</i>

08:35.182 --> 08:37.725
<i>on her grandmother's feud</i>

08:37.725 --> 08:40.270
<i>with her family in Venezuela.</i>

08:37.725 --> 08:40.270
Mm. I'm sure she'll love it.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.981
<i>Hmm. Xo seems weirdly into it.</i>

08:42.981 --> 08:44.649
<i>Ah, yes, I almost forgot.</i>

08:44.649 --> 08:46.485
<i>These two are still</i>

08:44.649 --> 08:46.485
<i>in the honeymoon phase.</i>

08:46.485 --> 08:48.611
<i>Lots of PDA.</i>

08:49.779 --> 08:51.406
My bracelet?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.784
So, I guess

08:52.782 --> 08:54.784
I should head home.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.536
Is Michael still irritable?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.413
So irritable.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.415
Which I get.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.415
LSATs are grueling.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.460
Oh, yeah. I was so stressed,

09:00.415 --> 09:03.460
my ulcer had an ulcer.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.170
Then I got to the first

09:03.460 --> 09:05.170
year of law school

09:05.170 --> 09:07.172
and I realized, ha, that was

09:05.170 --> 09:07.172
nothin'.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.799
I basically lived

09:07.172 --> 09:09.799
in the law library.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.885
And then it was 90 hours a week

09:09.799 --> 09:11.885
in the office

09:11.885 --> 09:14.137
racking up billable hours,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.137
massive student debt.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.598
God, it was hard. That's when

09:14.137 --> 09:17.598
my marriage<i> really</i> fell apart.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.436
But you guys are gonna be fine.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.355
Is that what it's gonna be like

09:21.436 --> 09:23.355
for the next three years?

09:23.355 --> 09:24.898
Assuming he gets in.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.898
And if he doesn't,

09:24.898 --> 09:27.317
he's gonna have to wait

09:24.898 --> 09:27.317
a whole year to reapply.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.735
And his severance

09:27.317 --> 09:28.735
runs out in six months.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.529
You're spiraling.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.529
I'm totally spiraling.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.239
( whispers ):

09:30.529 --> 09:32.239
I just feel really unsettled.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.657
Talk to Michael.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.657
Share your anxiety.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.951
Remember, he wants you

09:34.657 --> 09:36.951
to share your burdens with him.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.704
You're my wife.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.122
Let me help you.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.957
Yeah, you're right.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.084
MICHAEL:

09:42.957 --> 09:44.084
<i>Why the hell</i>

09:44.084 --> 09:45.544
would you tell me this<i> now?</i>

09:45.544 --> 09:47.546
You said to share things.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.546
Yeah,

09:47.546 --> 09:49.964
but it's all about timing, Jane,

09:47.546 --> 09:49.964
and now is not a good time!

09:49.964 --> 09:52.259
Telling me all your fears

09:49.964 --> 09:52.259
two weeks before

09:52.259 --> 09:54.511
I have to take

09:52.259 --> 09:54.511
the biggest test of my life

09:54.511 --> 09:56.012
is not helping me relax.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.056
And I need to be relaxed

09:56.012 --> 09:58.056
to study,

09:58.056 --> 10:00.392
and I need to study if I'm

09:58.056 --> 10:00.392
gonna get into law school.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.810
Although, apparently, that's

10:00.392 --> 10:02.810
suddenly stressful for you, too.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.146
So what's the point

10:02.810 --> 10:05.146
of any of this?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.399
NARRATOR:

10:05.146 --> 10:07.399
<i>Well argued, Counselor.</i>

10:11.445 --> 10:12.862
I am so sorry.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.365
I didn't even know

10:12.862 --> 10:15.365
how stressed I was.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.576
No. No, I get it.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.453
And of course you can

10:17.576 --> 10:19.453
tell me when you're stressed.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.537
You know that, right?

10:20.537 --> 10:22.080
NARRATOR:

10:20.537 --> 10:22.080
<i>To refresh...</i>

10:22.080 --> 10:24.291
Why the hell-- Your fears--

10:22.080 --> 10:24.291
Is not helping--

10:24.291 --> 10:26.084
Yeah. Totally.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.753
And I'm also gonna sign up

10:26.084 --> 10:28.753
for an LSAT prep class.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.047
I think it'll help me

10:28.753 --> 10:31.047
feel better prepared.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.799
I think that's a great idea.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.509
Maybe I'll try something, too.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.720
NARRATOR:<i> </i>

10:34.509 --> 10:37.720
<i>Let me guess.</i>

10:34.509 --> 10:37.720
<i>Research? Making a list?</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:39.347
Yoga? Really?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.681
<i>Oh. Okay.</i>

10:40.681 --> 10:42.434
I'm trying to figure out

10:40.681 --> 10:42.434
how to relax.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.143
And I researched.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.894
<i>I knew it.</i>

10:44.894 --> 10:47.522
And the classes at the Marbella

10:44.894 --> 10:47.522
are very well-rated on Yelp.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.357
Of course. You should go.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.357
Thank you.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.818
Get ready. Next time you see me,

10:51.818 --> 10:53.487
I'm gonna be all kinds of Zen.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.487
( chuckles )

10:53.487 --> 10:55.696
Hey, guys.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.696
What's going on?

10:53.487 --> 10:55.696
Hey.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.740
Hey there. You know,

10:55.696 --> 10:57.740
it's probably nothing.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.326
But I noticed

10:57.740 --> 10:59.326
at Mateo's playgroup

10:59.326 --> 11:01.369
that the other kids

10:59.326 --> 11:01.369
have a lot of words.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.745
Sentences, even.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.414
And he doesn't have any,

11:02.745 --> 11:04.414
just mama and dada.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.707
And we know we're probably

11:04.414 --> 11:06.707
stressing for no reason.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.751
Well, he should have a few

11:06.707 --> 11:08.751
more words than mama and dada.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.379
Is he bilingual?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.590
I talk to him in Spanish

11:11.379 --> 11:13.590
sometimes. My grandma does.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.426
Sometimes kids who grow up

11:13.590 --> 11:16.426
in bilingual households

11:16.426 --> 11:18.970
speak later, but then their

11:16.426 --> 11:18.970
language suddenly explodes.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.472
It's great

11:18.970 --> 11:20.472
for their brain development.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.349
That might be

11:20.472 --> 11:22.349
what's happening here.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.391
( sighs )

11:23.391 --> 11:25.560
Either that, or...

11:25.560 --> 11:27.270
NARRATOR:

11:25.560 --> 11:27.270
<i>Come on. Use your words.</i>

11:27.270 --> 11:30.231
Let's keep an eye on it

11:27.270 --> 11:30.231
for the next three months.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.400
If the words

11:30.231 --> 11:32.400
still aren't coming,

11:32.400 --> 11:35.153
we'll consider

11:32.400 --> 11:35.153
a speech pathologist.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.113
Try not to stress,

11:35.153 --> 11:37.113
though.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.199
It's not good for you.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.199
Or him.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.410
XIOMARA:

11:41.242 --> 11:42.410
<i>Geez.</i>

11:42.410 --> 11:44.329
How much yoga are you gonna do?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.497
I don't know. A lot.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.165
It's gonna make

11:45.497 --> 11:47.165
everything better.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.083
Okay...

11:49.083 --> 11:50.544
And I hate

11:49.083 --> 11:50.544
to stress you out more,

11:50.544 --> 11:52.212
Oh, no. Ma.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.212
Hon.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.382
There's no way you can show

11:52.212 --> 11:55.382
Abuela your novel as is.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.883
Really?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.883
I love it

11:56.883 --> 11:59.718
so much, but the way

11:56.883 --> 11:59.718
you describe her

11:59.718 --> 12:01.596
and the whole feud

11:59.718 --> 12:01.596
with her sister...

12:01.596 --> 12:04.516
It's fiction.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.516
You know how sensitive she is.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.560
( in Spanish ):

12:04.516 --> 12:06.560
What are you two talking about?

12:06.560 --> 12:10.021
( in English ):

12:06.560 --> 12:10.021
The difference

12:06.560 --> 12:10.021
between fiction and reality.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.691
For instance,

12:10.021 --> 12:12.691
if I was a cobbler,

12:12.691 --> 12:15.402
with a time portal, I would

12:12.691 --> 12:15.402
bring back modern tools

12:15.402 --> 12:18.613
from the future to make cobbling

12:15.402 --> 12:18.613
easier, but since it's fiction,

12:18.613 --> 12:21.199
it doesn't need

12:18.613 --> 12:21.199
to be perfectly accurate.

12:21.199 --> 12:24.785
Because people take liberties.

12:21.199 --> 12:24.785
You know?

12:24.785 --> 12:27.622
(in Spanish ):

12:24.785 --> 12:27.622
Hmm. Honestly,

12:27.622 --> 12:31.167
Tiago has never made

12:27.622 --> 12:31.167
much sense to me,

12:31.167 --> 12:33.794
NARRATOR:

12:31.167 --> 12:33.794
<i>And speaking of...</i>

12:33.794 --> 12:36.797
Ladies, gentlemen.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.759
(<i> guitar theme playing</i> )

12:40.759 --> 12:46.015
Thank you for coming

12:40.759 --> 12:46.015
to the last taping of<i> Tiago.</i>

12:46.015 --> 12:47.517
( applause )

12:46.015 --> 12:47.517
WOMAN: Yeah!

12:47.517 --> 12:49.936
Okay.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.606
I've had trouble

12:49.936 --> 12:52.606
figuring out what to say

12:52.606 --> 12:54.857
now that<i> Tiago</i> is ending.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.902
What started as a cheap rip-off

12:54.857 --> 12:57.902
of<i> Quantum Leap</i>

12:57.902 --> 13:01.114
has become much, much more.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.283
And now, as I stand here,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.243
back where it all began,

13:05.243 --> 13:07.370
in this cobbler's shed,

13:07.370 --> 13:10.206
I realize...

13:13.501 --> 13:17.422
...we cannot end it here,

13:13.501 --> 13:17.422
absolutely not!

13:18.256 --> 13:19.633
What?

13:18.256 --> 13:19.633
Sorry.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.635
It just hit me.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.635
We can't end<i> Tiago</i>

13:21.635 --> 13:22.969
in the exact same place

13:21.635 --> 13:22.969
it began.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.097
Rogelio,

13:22.969 --> 13:26.097
we had five meetings about this.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.348
You chose this.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.807
Well, I unchoose it.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.017
We can do better.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.229
We have to do better!

13:33.229 --> 13:35.940
You might want to take

13:33.229 --> 13:35.940
your dad with you to yoga.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.609
NARRATOR:

13:35.940 --> 13:37.609
<i>Also in need of relaxing...</i>

13:37.609 --> 13:39.694
( gasps )

13:39.694 --> 13:41.154
What the hell

13:39.694 --> 13:41.154
are you doing here?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.905
I want to talk to you

13:41.154 --> 13:42.905
about Anezka.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.532
NARRATOR:

13:42.905 --> 13:44.532
<i>Deep breath, Petra.</i>

13:44.532 --> 13:45.700
<i>Find your inner lotus.</i>

13:48.244 --> 13:49.870
Don't send her away.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.289
I love her.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.457
I just saw her the other day,

13:52.457 --> 13:53.874
and we still have

13:52.457 --> 13:53.874
a real connection.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.710
NARRATOR:

13:53.874 --> 13:55.710
<i>Ah, yes. You remember this...</i>

13:55.710 --> 13:57.462
I just wanted to say good-bye.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.879
I missed you.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.757
She's already gone.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.216
And that wasn't Anezka,

14:02.216 --> 14:04.010
you idiot, that was me.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.306
That's right. I know you and

14:05.679 --> 14:08.306
Rafael

14:08.306 --> 14:10.141
were working together

14:08.306 --> 14:10.141
to screw me.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.644
Get out of here,

14:10.141 --> 14:12.644
you vested vermin.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.567
Ah, don't worry, baby.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.236
Petra thinks you're gone.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.617
Now what, my king?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.453
Well, now we get some

14:27.617 --> 14:30.453
leverage on her,

14:30.453 --> 14:34.332
so we can be together,

14:30.453 --> 14:34.332
out in the open forever.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.796
DARCI:

14:38.294 --> 14:39.796
<i>All right, Rogelio.</i>

14:39.796 --> 14:41.756
It's been three weeks,

14:39.796 --> 14:41.756
where are we?

14:41.756 --> 14:43.341
NARRATOR:

14:41.756 --> 14:43.341
<i>Alas, the moment of truth.</i>

14:43.341 --> 14:45.760
<i>Is there still</i>

14:43.341 --> 14:45.760
<i>a love connection here?</i>

14:45.760 --> 14:47.387
It's fine. I feel nothing.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.265
Really?

14:51.265 --> 14:53.226
Mm-hmm.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.226
( chuckles )

14:56.604 --> 14:58.231
Uh-uh.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.107
( whimpers quietly )

15:01.776 --> 15:02.902
Okay. I have a boner.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.237
Ay, Rogelio.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.031
Not a physical boner,

15:04.237 --> 15:07.031
an emotional one.

15:07.031 --> 15:11.411
An emo-ner, if you will.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.995
I'm sorry. I have to be honest.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.997
Yeah. I know.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.459
Okay.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.629
So it's a no-go on the kid.

15:21.629 --> 15:25.299
For now.

15:25.299 --> 15:28.094
Unless, perhaps...

15:28.094 --> 15:30.054
it were

15:28.094 --> 15:30.054
to happen eventually...

15:30.054 --> 15:32.306
the old-fashioned way.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.017
Can't we go on a date?

15:32.306 --> 15:35.017
See where this leads.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.774
Fine. One date.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.693
At this moment, I would love

15:40.774 --> 15:43.693
to grab you in my embrace

15:43.693 --> 15:45.236
and kiss you,

15:43.693 --> 15:45.236
but I must ask first,

15:45.236 --> 15:48.740
since Donald Trump has ruined

15:45.236 --> 15:48.740
romance for all of us.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.158
NARRATOR:

15:48.740 --> 15:51.158
<i>Along with a lot</i>

15:48.740 --> 15:51.158
<i>of other things.</i>

15:51.158 --> 15:54.370
Yes.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.413
You can kiss me.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.706
( groans )

16:00.960 --> 16:04.046
INSTRUCTOR:

16:00.960 --> 16:04.046
Now remember, thoughts are

16:00.960 --> 16:04.046
just things to let go of,

16:04.046 --> 16:06.800
so as a thought arises,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.968
let it drift away

16:06.800 --> 16:08.968
as if on a cloud.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.846
Inhale your worries...

16:08.968 --> 16:11.846
( inhales )

16:11.846 --> 16:13.514
and exhale, let them go.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.891
( exhales )

16:14.891 --> 16:17.268
Inhale...

16:17.268 --> 16:19.437
and exhale.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.439
Inhale...

16:21.439 --> 16:23.775
and exhale.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.277
Can you scooch over? Jane!

16:27.570 --> 16:29.238
Scooch a little.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.825
NARRATOR:

16:29.238 --> 16:31.825
<i>Inhale and exhale, Jane.</i>

16:31.825 --> 16:35.495
INSTRUCTOR:

16:31.825 --> 16:35.495
And slowly transition

16:31.825 --> 16:35.495
into downward dog.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.663
And exhale into the pose...

16:36.663 --> 16:38.289
So I actually wanted

16:36.663 --> 16:38.289
to talk to you.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.457
Now's not a great time.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.876
I can't relax

16:39.457 --> 16:41.876
until it's sorted.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.796
INSTRUCTOR:

16:41.876 --> 16:44.796
Good. Breathing in and out.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.464
( inhales )

16:46.464 --> 16:47.799
Inhale...

16:47.799 --> 16:50.927
Calm... exhale your fear.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.219
Did you actually say

16:52.219 --> 16:55.139
you'd be happy if Rafael

16:52.219 --> 16:55.139
broke up with me?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.307
Did he say that?

16:56.307 --> 16:57.767
You haven't answered

16:56.307 --> 16:57.767
my question.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.353
INSTRUCTOR:

16:57.767 --> 17:00.353
Now let's move into Kasyapasana.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.896
Beginners just try a side plank.

17:01.896 --> 17:05.525
I am not one

17:01.896 --> 17:05.525
to hold on to things.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.443
NARRATOR:

17:05.525 --> 17:07.443
<i>How is she doing that?</i>

17:07.443 --> 17:09.529
So if you said it,

17:07.443 --> 17:09.529
I'd rather you just tell me.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.571
Fine. I did.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.490
I can't believe it.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.825
Since you've been here

17:12.490 --> 17:13.825
you've constantly lied.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.910
That is not...

17:13.825 --> 17:15.910
It is. And you know it.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.244
You are a liar!

17:17.244 --> 17:18.830
Why don't you step away

17:18.830 --> 17:20.874
until you can...

17:18.830 --> 17:20.874
( inhales and exhales )

17:20.874 --> 17:22.166
...calm yourself down.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.006
( inhales )

17:31.384 --> 17:33.260
(<i> knocking on door</i> )

17:34.971 --> 17:36.138
I'm in.

17:36.138 --> 17:39.141
$10,000 and...

17:39.141 --> 17:41.394
throw in your watch.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.151
Afternoon.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.737
Hey.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.824
( in Spanish ):

17:52.989 --> 17:54.824
I read your book, Jane

17:54.824 --> 17:57.994
Don't blame your mother.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.994
I took it out of her bag.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.120
( in English ):

17:57.994 --> 18:00.120
I haven't turned it in.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.120
I-I can make changes.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.540
( in Spanish ):

18:00.120 --> 18:02.540
I loved it.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.875
You did?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.835
NARRATOR:

18:03.875 --> 18:05.835
<i>Whoa. I didn't see that coming.</i>

18:05.835 --> 18:07.545
Even though

18:05.835 --> 18:07.545
you made it seem

18:07.545 --> 18:11.090
like I stole that necklace,

18:07.545 --> 18:11.090
when I didn't--

18:11.090 --> 18:14.052
You are a writer, Jane.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.554
An incredible writer.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.140
Abuela.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.475
And if...

18:21.475 --> 18:24.062
this is what came out

18:21.475 --> 18:24.062
of all that

18:24.062 --> 18:28.274
drama with my sister and the

18:24.062 --> 18:28.274
letters and Catalina, well...

18:30.443 --> 18:32.904
it was all worth it.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.739
Thank you,

18:34.739 --> 18:36.741
for telling my story.

18:36.741 --> 18:39.744
( crying and laughing )

18:39.744 --> 18:41.955
I'm so happy right now.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.539
( both laughing )

18:43.539 --> 18:45.374
NARRATOR ( crying ):

18:43.539 --> 18:45.374
<i>Me, too.</i>

18:49.045 --> 18:50.588
Hey, Darci.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.048
Oh, hi.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.051
Hear you have

18:52.048 --> 18:55.051
a big date.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.177
I'm actually

18:55.051 --> 18:57.177
really excited.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.140
( Rogelio clears throat )

19:02.266 --> 19:03.935
Thank you all for coming.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.062
I'm sorry to announce

19:03.935 --> 19:06.062
we will not be filming

19:06.062 --> 19:08.022
the<i> Tiago</i> finale today.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.732
Thank you and drive safe.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.734
DINA:

19:09.732 --> 19:11.734
Rogelio.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.235
What are you doing?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.570
Ending<i> Tiago</i> in outer space

19:14.570 --> 19:16.238
on the International

19:14.570 --> 19:16.238
Space Station

19:16.238 --> 19:19.408
in an homage to

19:16.238 --> 19:19.408
<i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>

19:19.408 --> 19:21.995
is a dumb idea

19:19.408 --> 19:21.995
from a dumb film

19:21.995 --> 19:23.704
I admit

19:21.995 --> 19:23.704
I do not understand

19:23.704 --> 19:26.457
and should have

19:23.704 --> 19:26.457
never agreed to.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.042
Well, you did.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.377
Well, I un-agree.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.462
I...

19:33.255 --> 19:34.674
Xo, will you talk to him?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.634
You're the only one

19:34.674 --> 19:36.634
who can get through to him

19:36.634 --> 19:37.551
when he's like this.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.679
Of course.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.558
(<i> printer grinding</i> )

19:46.393 --> 19:49.188
I thought you were done.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.941
The deadline,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.941
your<i> abuela</i> liked it.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.651
I found a few typos.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.651
Oh.

19:53.651 --> 19:54.986
Got it.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.445
So much extra

19:54.986 --> 19:56.445
did you have to pay

19:56.445 --> 19:57.989
for the world's loudest printer?

19:56.445 --> 19:57.989
( chuckles )

19:57.989 --> 20:00.533
NARRATOR:

19:57.989 --> 20:00.533
<i>Here's a fun LSAT logic game:</i>

20:08.582 --> 20:10.250
<i>Is the answer:</i>

20:08.582 --> 20:10.250
<i>( printer beeping )</i>

20:11.335 --> 20:12.795
Shoot. Another one.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.757
<i>Or C...</i>

20:16.757 --> 20:19.259
Seriously?

20:19.259 --> 20:21.679
Sorry. Last time.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.891
Okay. You know what? I'm gonna

20:21.679 --> 20:24.891
go to the coffee shop, okay?

20:26.017 --> 20:28.853
Hmm.

20:28.853 --> 20:32.314
NARRATOR:

20:28.853 --> 20:32.314
<i>Looks like someone's having</i>

20:28.853 --> 20:32.314
<i>trouble letting go.</i>

20:32.314 --> 20:34.901
<i>And speaking of letting go...</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:37.528
<i>All right, Rafael,</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:37.528
<i>drop her like she's hot.</i>

20:37.528 --> 20:39.405
Listen, Rafael, we've

20:37.528 --> 20:39.405
been having loads of fun,

20:39.405 --> 20:41.657
but we've come

20:39.405 --> 20:41.657
to the end of our road.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.659
It's time for me to go.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.659
You're leaving?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.078
NARRATOR:

20:43.659 --> 20:45.078
<i>Well, that was easy.</i>

20:45.078 --> 20:46.579
Well, uh, if you

20:46.579 --> 20:48.915
really feel

20:46.579 --> 20:48.915
you have to go...

20:48.915 --> 20:50.875
But I thought maybe

20:48.915 --> 20:50.875
we could have

20:50.875 --> 20:52.376
one last adventure together.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.920
No strings attached.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.421
NARRATOR:

20:53.920 --> 20:55.421
<i>Don't do it, Rafael.</i>

20:55.421 --> 20:56.964
( laughing ):

20:55.421 --> 20:56.964
I, uh...

20:56.964 --> 20:58.340
happened to grab

20:56.964 --> 20:58.340
a few pamphlets

20:58.340 --> 21:00.176
from the front desk...

20:58.340 --> 21:00.176
( exhales )

21:00.176 --> 21:01.886
Things to do around Miami.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.137
Pick one.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.513
Oh, come on.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.849
What do you have to lose?

21:06.849 --> 21:08.851
We'll have great sex,

21:06.849 --> 21:08.851
great fun

21:08.851 --> 21:10.686
and a great story

21:08.851 --> 21:10.686
to tell someday.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.897
Our last hurrah.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.357
Besides, you could use

21:12.897 --> 21:15.357
a proper adventure.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.859
Couldn't you?

21:16.859 --> 21:18.318
Close your eyes.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.696
( both laughing )

21:20.696 --> 21:22.489
( sighs )

21:22.489 --> 21:25.076
NARRATOR:

21:22.489 --> 21:25.076
<i>Man, I can't even watch this.</i>

21:25.076 --> 21:27.995
<i>Hopefully, this is</i>

21:25.076 --> 21:27.995
<i>a happier date.</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:30.206
If we find ourselves

21:27.995 --> 21:30.206
overcome with desire

21:30.206 --> 21:32.458
and are unable to make it

21:30.206 --> 21:32.458
through the entrees,

21:32.458 --> 21:34.418
we can always

21:32.458 --> 21:34.418
finish our meal at home.

21:34.418 --> 21:40.967
I, for one, am always

21:34.418 --> 21:40.967
<i>ravenous</i> after lovemaking.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.761
Darci Rule Number 12--

21:40.967 --> 21:43.761
never lay it on too thick.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.012
It makes you look desperate.

21:45.012 --> 21:48.015
Rogelio de la Vega is not now,

21:48.015 --> 21:50.684
nor has he ever been, desperate.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.353
Classic narcissism paired

21:50.684 --> 21:53.353
with a third-person reference.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.231
I see it all the time from my

21:53.353 --> 21:55.231
A-listers.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.899
I didn't think

21:55.231 --> 21:56.899
I'd get it from you, though.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.860
Are you trying to say

21:56.899 --> 21:59.860
I'm not an A-lister?

21:59.860 --> 22:01.528
Are you trying

21:59.860 --> 22:01.528
to say that you are?

22:01.528 --> 22:03.739
Salad nicoise for the lady.

22:05.116 --> 22:08.828
And seafood quartet

22:05.116 --> 22:08.828
for the gentleman.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.788
NARRATOR:

22:08.828 --> 22:10.788
<i>Man, that's a lot of fish.</i>

22:15.084 --> 22:17.003
Darci Rule Number 23--

22:17.003 --> 22:19.880
never order something you

22:17.003 --> 22:19.880
don't look attractive eating.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.715
Clearly you skipped

22:19.880 --> 22:21.715
that lesson.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.383
What's going on?

22:23.383 --> 22:24.802
Why are you being so critical?

22:24.802 --> 22:26.553
Hey, this is me.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.553
You want to date me,

22:26.553 --> 22:27.763
you need to know

22:26.553 --> 22:27.763
exactly who I am.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.515
Not all at once!

22:29.515 --> 22:31.433
You hide this stuff

22:29.515 --> 22:31.433
on your first date.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.560
Then, as someone starts

22:31.433 --> 22:33.560
to fall for you,

22:33.560 --> 22:36.105
you slowly reveal

22:33.560 --> 22:36.105
all your quirks.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.857
I just want to cut

22:36.105 --> 22:37.857
to the chase.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.984
See if it's worth investing

22:37.857 --> 22:39.984
in this relationship or not.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.695
Well, you're gonna be this

22:39.984 --> 22:42.695
critical, then the answer is no.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.947
We should go

22:42.695 --> 22:44.947
our separate ways.

22:44.947 --> 22:48.201
Or, you know, put me back

22:44.947 --> 22:48.201
in your dating pool,

22:48.201 --> 22:50.203
since I paid for

22:48.201 --> 22:50.203
the three-month platinum plan.

22:50.203 --> 22:53.039
Fine. And we'll just go back

22:50.203 --> 22:53.039
to the kid plan.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.748
No.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.625
Kids deserve

22:54.748 --> 22:56.625
to be treated

22:56.625 --> 22:58.127
like A-listers, too.

22:58.127 --> 23:01.463
And if you're gonna be

22:58.127 --> 23:01.463
this critical with me, well...

23:01.463 --> 23:03.174
MICHAEL:

23:01.463 --> 23:03.174
<i>No way.</i>

23:03.174 --> 23:06.302
I thought you were just gonna

23:03.174 --> 23:06.302
make a few little changes.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.347
I was, but that led

23:06.302 --> 23:09.347
to a few bigger changes,

23:09.347 --> 23:12.474
and then the whole thing started

23:09.347 --> 23:12.474
unraveling, and now I'm lost.

23:14.352 --> 23:16.020
What's that?

23:14.352 --> 23:16.020
Essential oils

23:16.020 --> 23:17.897
from my new yoga teacher who

23:16.020 --> 23:17.897
thought I needed to chill out.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.067
She applies it to her temples.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.067
I'll try some of that.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.443
Really need a good night's sleep

23:21.067 --> 23:23.443
for my interview tomorrow.

23:23.443 --> 23:26.697
NARRATOR:

23:23.443 --> 23:26.697
<i>Okay, so just breathe</i>

23:23.443 --> 23:26.697
<i>that in and...</i>

23:26.697 --> 23:30.576
<i>Wow. The oils really seem</i>

23:26.697 --> 23:30.576
<i>to be relaxing Michael.</i>

23:30.576 --> 23:33.162
<i>Jane? Not so much.</i>

23:33.162 --> 23:35.706
<i>She needs to go medical grade,</i>

23:33.162 --> 23:35.706
<i>in my opinion.</i>

23:37.415 --> 23:39.293
<i>You know, I don't think</i>

23:37.415 --> 23:39.293
<i>you understand</i>

23:39.293 --> 23:42.296
<i>how truly stressed Jane is,</i>

23:39.293 --> 23:42.296
<i>so I'm going to let you in.</i>

23:42.296 --> 23:44.673
JANE:

23:42.296 --> 23:44.673
<i>Oh, good. Michael's sleeping.</i>

23:44.673 --> 23:46.217
<i>Good for him.</i>

23:46.217 --> 23:51.347
<i>I'm glad he can sleep.</i>

23:46.217 --> 23:51.347
<i>I'm so happy about that.</i>

23:51.347 --> 23:54.934
<i>And I'll get used to dealing</i>

23:51.347 --> 23:54.934
<i>with my own anxiety myself.</i>

23:56.394 --> 23:57.895
You seem stressed, babe.

23:56.394 --> 23:57.895
( sighs )

23:57.895 --> 23:59.313
I am.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.607
Actually, I was hoping

23:59.313 --> 24:01.607
that I could talk.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.649
Do you mind heading out

24:01.607 --> 24:02.649
to your stress shed,

24:02.649 --> 24:04.235
because I'm stressed,

24:04.235 --> 24:05.903
and your stress really

24:04.235 --> 24:05.903
isn't working for me, okay?

24:05.903 --> 24:07.321
JANE:

24:05.903 --> 24:07.321
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

24:07.321 --> 24:09.365
<i>Come on, Jane.</i>

24:07.321 --> 24:09.365
<i>Keep it real. Relax.</i>

24:09.365 --> 24:11.867
<i>Relax.</i>

24:11.867 --> 24:13.869
<i>Mateo. Oh, think of Mateo.</i>

24:13.869 --> 24:15.621
<i>Yes, Mr. Sweetface.</i>

24:15.621 --> 24:18.749
Hi, Mr. Sweetface.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.749
How was kindergarten?

24:18.749 --> 24:21.710
( in a deep voice ):

24:18.749 --> 24:21.710
It ruled! I totes dominated

24:18.749 --> 24:21.710
at kickball today.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.922
And I'm pretty sure I'll have

24:21.710 --> 24:24.922
my ABCs down any day now.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.591
JANE:

24:24.922 --> 24:27.591
<i>Mateo's fine.</i>

24:24.922 --> 24:27.591
<i>Do not stress about Mateo,</i>

24:27.591 --> 24:29.135
<i>not for three months.</i>

24:29.135 --> 24:30.844
<i>Focus on your novel.</i>

24:30.844 --> 24:33.180
<i>You have to finish</i>

24:30.844 --> 24:33.180
<i>your freakin' novel.</i>

24:33.180 --> 24:35.891
I'm just rethinking the opening

24:33.180 --> 24:35.891
of chapter four.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.269
I need those pages before

24:35.891 --> 24:38.269
I drop dead, Ms. Villanueva.

24:38.269 --> 24:40.771
NARRATOR:

24:38.269 --> 24:40.771
<i>Like I said,</i>

24:38.269 --> 24:40.771
<i>I think she's going</i>

24:40.771 --> 24:43.274
<i>to need something stronger</i>

24:40.771 --> 24:43.274
<i>than essential oils.</i>

24:49.780 --> 24:52.032
<i>Oh, good.</i>

24:49.780 --> 24:52.032
( sighs )

24:52.032 --> 24:53.826
<i>Looks like Jane finally</i>

24:52.032 --> 24:53.826
<i>got some sleep.</i>

24:53.826 --> 24:57.413
Ah. ( gasps ) Oh!

24:57.413 --> 24:59.832
<i>And Michael turned</i>

24:57.413 --> 24:59.832
<i>into a puffer fish!</i>

24:59.832 --> 25:01.917
What's wrong?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.917
<i>Whoa!</i>

25:04.753 --> 25:06.546
He had some allergic reaction,

25:06.546 --> 25:09.049
and now he has a law school

25:06.546 --> 25:09.049
interview this afternoon.

25:09.049 --> 25:13.429
Looks like I just pulled my head

25:09.049 --> 25:13.429
out of a beehive.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.848
All right, let's give him

25:13.429 --> 25:15.848
the full Mickey Rourke.

25:15.848 --> 25:19.435
He's gonna look a little tan

25:15.848 --> 25:19.435
and weird and greasy,

25:19.435 --> 25:22.938
but at least

25:19.435 --> 25:22.938
he won't look contagious. Go!

25:22.938 --> 25:26.400
Thanks for doing this, Dad.

25:22.938 --> 25:26.400
I hope I didn't put anyone out.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.945
No, no. The whole crew has

25:26.400 --> 25:29.945
been here for 24 hours straight.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.780
Nothing's right for

25:29.945 --> 25:31.780
the ending of<i> Tiago.</i>

25:31.780 --> 25:33.282
I get it.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.783
I thought I was done

25:33.282 --> 25:34.783
with my novel,

25:34.783 --> 25:36.618
and then I just took

25:34.783 --> 25:36.618
the entire thing apart.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.620
Ooh, I know.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.999
You can end<i> Tiago</i> in Venezuela

25:38.620 --> 25:41.999
circa 1975. ( laughs )

25:41.999 --> 25:44.710
Oh, God, no,

25:41.999 --> 25:44.710
that sounds incredibly boring.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.838
( chuckles )

25:44.710 --> 25:47.838
I meant to dramatize,

25:47.838 --> 25:49.382
you know, visually, on-screen.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.509
Nice save.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.509
Hmm.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.677
Hey, how was your date

25:51.509 --> 25:53.677
with Darci?

25:53.677 --> 25:56.472
Terrible.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.472
She was super critical.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.849
It was clear that she didn't

25:56.472 --> 25:58.849
even want to be there.

25:58.849 --> 26:02.228
What? She was so excited

25:58.849 --> 26:02.228
when I saw her right before.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.104
MICHAEL:

26:02.228 --> 26:04.104
So, how do I look?

26:06.190 --> 26:09.276
So much better.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.653
Eat your heart out,

26:09.276 --> 26:11.653
Mickey Rourke.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.364
Right, Matelio?

26:13.364 --> 26:15.157
And Rafael's not

26:13.364 --> 26:15.157
answering his phone,

26:15.157 --> 26:17.868
so looks like Mateo's coming

26:15.157 --> 26:17.868
with us to the interview.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.537
I'll drive, you rest.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.414
It'll be our first

26:19.537 --> 26:21.414
family road trip.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.665
Where's-where's Rafael?

26:23.665 --> 26:25.334
NARRATOR:

26:23.665 --> 26:25.334
<i>Let's find out.</i>

26:25.334 --> 26:28.962
Just... try

26:25.334 --> 26:28.962
and relax.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.631
Be... in the moment.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.551
NARRATOR:

26:31.631 --> 26:33.551
<i>What moment? Where are we?</i>

26:33.551 --> 26:36.387
Now, close your eyes.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.055
Open your spirit,

26:38.055 --> 26:40.640
and listen to the ancestors.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.017
( whispering ):

26:40.640 --> 26:42.017
This really isn't my thing.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.936
Feel the vibrations

26:42.017 --> 26:43.936
around you.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.936
Come on.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.480
What's the worst

26:43.936 --> 26:46.480
that could happen?

26:46.480 --> 26:48.857
With my luck, one

26:46.480 --> 26:48.857
of my ancestors will manifest

26:48.857 --> 26:50.276
and turn out

26:48.857 --> 26:50.276
to be an ax murderer.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.194
( laughing )

26:52.194 --> 26:53.446
Shh.

26:52.194 --> 26:53.446
( inhales )

26:53.446 --> 26:56.740
This is a ceremony

26:53.446 --> 26:56.740
about rebirth.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.825
The warm, dark hut

26:56.740 --> 26:58.825
represents the womb.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.287
And when this

26:58.825 --> 27:01.287
ritual is over,

27:01.287 --> 27:04.622
you will be reborn

27:01.287 --> 27:04.622
into the world.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.793
( steam hissing )

27:05.916 --> 27:07.793
Allow the steam

27:07.793 --> 27:10.712
to cleanse

27:07.793 --> 27:10.712
the impurities of your past.

27:10.712 --> 27:14.341
Let the heat melt your burdens

27:10.712 --> 27:14.341
and fears...

27:14.341 --> 27:17.219
I feel really hot.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.846
Like...

27:19.846 --> 27:21.765
<i>so</i> hot.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.934
( whispering ):

27:21.765 --> 27:23.934
Well, that's the point.

27:23.934 --> 27:26.061
It's a sweat...

27:23.934 --> 27:26.061
( thuds )

27:29.898 --> 27:32.526
( sighs )

27:29.898 --> 27:32.526
Are you okay?

27:32.526 --> 27:34.361
I'll be fine.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.946
I don't know what happened.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.490
( laughing )

27:39.617 --> 27:42.369
Look, this whole thing

27:39.617 --> 27:42.369
just isn't my scene.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.371
A little too

27:42.369 --> 27:44.371
hippy-dippy for me.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.789
Huh.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.000
See, I actually really liked

27:48.000 --> 27:50.919
what the guru was saying...

27:48.000 --> 27:50.919
about rebirth.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.340
I like to think that's possible,

27:50.919 --> 27:54.340
because there's something so...

27:54.340 --> 27:57.259
optimistic about it, you know?

27:57.259 --> 28:00.095
If you screw things up,

27:57.259 --> 28:00.095
you can make it right.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.972
Yeah, I can see that.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.560
(voice breaks):

28:04.183 --> 28:06.560
On the other hand...

28:08.270 --> 28:10.606
Rafael, are you all right?

28:12.274 --> 28:13.942
Well... ( laughs )

28:13.942 --> 28:15.528
Sorry. ( sniffles )

28:15.528 --> 28:17.904
I must still be

28:15.528 --> 28:17.904
overheated or something.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.032
Well, what's going on?

28:20.032 --> 28:23.369
Just the whole, um...

28:23.369 --> 28:26.497
all the rebirth thing.

28:26.497 --> 28:27.998
I just found out

28:27.998 --> 28:30.125
my parents aren't really

28:27.998 --> 28:30.125
my parents, so, you know?

28:30.125 --> 28:31.835
What?

28:31.835 --> 28:34.712
Which I shouldn't be dumping

28:31.835 --> 28:34.712
on you on our last trip away.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.507
No, no, no,

28:34.712 --> 28:36.507
of course you should.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.843
You can trust me.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.554
NARRATOR:

28:39.843 --> 28:41.554
<i>Only he couldn't, friends!</i>

28:41.554 --> 28:43.180
<i>Remember.</i>

28:45.807 --> 28:47.809
<i>I know. This is bad.</i>

28:47.809 --> 28:49.353
( door closes )

28:51.104 --> 28:52.814
<i>Really bad.</i>

28:52.814 --> 28:54.858
RADIO ANNOUNCER:

28:52.814 --> 28:54.858
<i>Really, really bad</i>

28:52.814 --> 28:54.858
<i>traffic.</i>

28:54.858 --> 28:56.860
<i>If you're on I-95 right now,</i>

28:54.858 --> 28:56.860
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

28:56.860 --> 28:58.529
( horn honks )<i> </i>

28:56.860 --> 28:58.529
<i>That oil spill</i>

28:58.529 --> 29:00.739
<i>has just shut down traffic</i>

28:58.529 --> 29:00.739
<i>in both directions.</i>

29:00.739 --> 29:01.948
( turns off radio )

29:01.948 --> 29:04.034
What?!

29:01.948 --> 29:04.034
Nothing.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.911
It's not my fault that

29:04.034 --> 29:05.911
they shut down the highway.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.204
I never said it was.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.081
Then would you stop

29:07.204 --> 29:09.081
giving me dirty looks?

29:09.081 --> 29:11.041
It's not dirty looks.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.041
This is just my swollen, puffy,

29:11.041 --> 29:13.669
melting

29:11.041 --> 29:13.669
Mickey Rourke face, okay?

29:13.669 --> 29:15.462
It actually looks like

29:13.669 --> 29:15.462
it's getting better,

29:15.462 --> 29:17.839
like the antihistamines

29:15.462 --> 29:17.839
are kicking in.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.341
This is ridiculous.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.510
There's no way

29:19.341 --> 29:21.510
we're gonna make the interview,

29:21.510 --> 29:23.387
so I'm calling to cancel.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.764
( touch tones sounding )

29:25.764 --> 29:26.682
( grunts )

29:26.682 --> 29:27.974
( touch tones sounding )

29:27.974 --> 29:29.893
Do you want me

29:27.974 --> 29:29.893
to dial for you?

29:27.974 --> 29:29.893
No!

29:29.893 --> 29:31.144
JANE:

29:29.893 --> 29:31.144
Okay.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.231
( Mateo sniffles, sobs )

29:34.231 --> 29:37.234
Oh, great. It's a voice mail.

29:37.234 --> 29:38.569
( Mateo screaming )

29:37.234 --> 29:38.569
Oh.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.988
NARRATOR:

29:39.778 --> 29:41.988
<i>Essential oils, anyone?</i>

29:44.783 --> 29:46.243
( Mateo continues crying )

29:46.243 --> 29:48.746
It's gonna take at least

29:46.243 --> 29:48.746
three hours to clear.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.456
Are you serious?

29:48.746 --> 29:50.456
According

29:48.746 --> 29:50.456
to the Internet.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.165
( sighing ):

29:50.456 --> 29:52.165
Oh!

29:52.165 --> 29:53.833
MICHAEL:

29:52.165 --> 29:53.833
Look, there's a campsite

29:52.165 --> 29:53.833
off that exit.

29:53.833 --> 29:56.128
We should pull off.

29:53.833 --> 29:56.128
Seriously?

29:56.128 --> 30:00.006
NARRATOR:

29:56.128 --> 30:00.006
<i>Let me remind you</i>

29:56.128 --> 30:00.006
<i>that Jane hates camping...</i>

30:00.006 --> 30:02.468
<i>which Michael knows.</i>

30:00.006 --> 30:02.468
I have my gear in the trunk.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.094
You want to stay the night?

30:04.094 --> 30:06.430
It'll be dark in an hour,

30:04.094 --> 30:06.430
and we're three hours

30:06.430 --> 30:08.140
from moving, okay?

30:06.430 --> 30:08.140
( Mateo shrieks )

30:08.140 --> 30:10.016
NARRATOR:

30:08.140 --> 30:10.016
<i>I think we know where</i>

30:08.140 --> 30:10.016
<i>Mateo stands.</i>

30:10.016 --> 30:11.893
Great. Fine, let's camp.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.979
Feet to the fire.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.979
I did.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.522
More personal than Brexit.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.149
Oh, it was so embarrassing.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.776
I thought it would never pass,

30:17.149 --> 30:18.776
so I didn't vote.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.026
Nope. Not counting it.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.487
I had so many friends

30:20.026 --> 30:21.487
in Parliament.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.613
More personal!

30:22.613 --> 30:24.906
Fine! Fine!

30:22.613 --> 30:24.906
More personal.

30:24.906 --> 30:28.327
I can't have kids.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.829
How's that?

30:32.331 --> 30:35.292
It's fine. No pity.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.464
Well... I can't have

30:37.002 --> 30:40.464
any more, either,

30:40.464 --> 30:42.215
so, you know...

30:42.215 --> 30:44.426
You do have three.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.595
So not the same.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.430
Uh-uh.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.430
Mm.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.265
I didn't even think

30:48.430 --> 30:50.265
you liked kids.

30:50.265 --> 30:54.060
Oh, I do. So much.

30:54.060 --> 30:58.023
That's why I've been...

30:54.060 --> 30:58.023
pulling away from yours.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.442
Don't want to get attached.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.361
I had no idea.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.571
Well, we've been

31:02.361 --> 31:04.571
getting drunk on tequila

31:04.571 --> 31:08.325
and having... great sex,

31:08.325 --> 31:12.496
so, hasn't been the most

31:08.325 --> 31:12.496
serious relationship.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.708
Yeah. You're right.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.003
NARRATOR:

31:18.001 --> 31:20.003
<i>Don't get sucked in, Raf!</i>

31:20.003 --> 31:22.922
<i>She's playing you! She took</i>

31:20.003 --> 31:22.922
<i>Petra's watch, for God's sake!</i>

31:22.922 --> 31:25.676
Wait.

31:25.676 --> 31:28.345
I need to tell you something.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.514
( groans )

31:30.514 --> 31:32.265
I wish we were home!

31:30.514 --> 31:32.265
NARRATOR:<i> To be clear,</i>

31:32.265 --> 31:34.017
<i>Michael definitely</i>

31:32.265 --> 31:34.017
<i>got that memo.</i>

31:34.017 --> 31:36.520
I told you, you need

31:34.017 --> 31:36.520
to use a rock.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.858
Not that hard.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.858
You'll bend the stake.

31:40.858 --> 31:43.026
You are the world's worst

31:40.858 --> 31:43.026
back-seat tent-putter-upper.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.110
It takes ten minutes.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.154
Good. Great.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.154
You get the medal.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.824
I don't want a medal. I don't

31:46.154 --> 31:48.824
understand what's happening.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.451
What's happening is

31:48.824 --> 31:51.451
you are stressing me out.

31:51.451 --> 31:52.786
And I'm not allowed to tell you,

31:52.786 --> 31:54.204
but you are. If we can't

31:52.786 --> 31:54.204
deal with stress

31:54.204 --> 31:55.955
while you're trying

31:54.204 --> 31:55.955
to get into law school,

31:55.955 --> 31:58.041
how are we gonna do it

31:55.955 --> 31:58.041
when you're<i> in</i> law school?

31:58.041 --> 31:59.501
Well, you don't have

31:58.041 --> 31:59.501
to worry about that,

31:59.501 --> 32:01.044
'cause I'm not getting into

31:59.501 --> 32:01.044
any law schools,

32:01.044 --> 32:03.171
since I failed every one

32:01.044 --> 32:03.171
of my practice tests.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.389
So what happened?

32:10.345 --> 32:12.389
Because you liked me.

32:12.389 --> 32:15.225
What?

32:12.389 --> 32:15.225
Even Jane saw it.

32:15.225 --> 32:16.852
So why did you

32:15.225 --> 32:16.852
push me away?

32:16.852 --> 32:18.437
I didn't.

32:19.897 --> 32:21.189
You feel something.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.359
I don't.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.528
And I don't believe you.

32:28.781 --> 32:31.324
Okay, fine. I have an

32:28.781 --> 32:31.324
emotional boner or whatever.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.368
But I don't want

32:31.324 --> 32:33.368
to get involved.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.536
Why?

32:34.536 --> 32:36.371
Because you're

32:34.536 --> 32:36.371
too attached to your ex.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.748
I know how this works.

32:37.748 --> 32:40.834
I'm a matchmaker

32:37.748 --> 32:40.834
for cripes' sake.

32:40.834 --> 32:44.296
That kind of baggage

32:40.834 --> 32:44.296
does not fit in the overhead.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.965
Oh, come on.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.965
Everyone's got baggage.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.552
The way you are reacting

32:46.965 --> 32:50.552
to the way I reacted to Xo,

32:50.552 --> 32:52.262
that's coming

32:50.552 --> 32:52.262
from your baggage.

32:52.262 --> 32:55.056
Yeah. Obviously someone

32:52.262 --> 32:55.056
you were dating

32:55.056 --> 32:56.850
went back to an ex.

32:56.850 --> 33:00.312
Look. Sure, in an ideal world

32:56.850 --> 33:00.312
we'd be like Adam and Eve,

33:00.312 --> 33:02.648
the first man

33:00.312 --> 33:02.648
and woman on Earth

33:02.648 --> 33:05.275
with totally clean

33:02.648 --> 33:05.275
slates, but...

33:05.275 --> 33:06.902
NARRATOR

33:05.275 --> 33:06.902
<i>And that's when it hit him.</i>

33:06.902 --> 33:08.528
<i>The genesis of a great idea.</i>

33:08.528 --> 33:10.029
What the hell

33:08.528 --> 33:10.029
are you looking at?

33:10.029 --> 33:11.615
I-I-I'm sorry, Darci,

33:10.029 --> 33:11.615
I know we're supposed

33:11.615 --> 33:13.074
to be discussing

33:11.615 --> 33:13.074
our relationship,

33:13.074 --> 33:15.368
but I need to get

33:13.074 --> 33:15.368
down to the stage

33:15.368 --> 33:17.579
and have the writers do

33:15.368 --> 33:17.579
another all-night revision.

33:17.579 --> 33:20.373
But I'd really like it if you

33:17.579 --> 33:20.373
came to the finale of<i> Tiago,</i>

33:20.373 --> 33:22.417
for the last time.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.587
You'll see that you

33:22.417 --> 33:25.587
have inspired it.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.636
Why didn't you tell me

33:30.216 --> 33:32.636
about the tests?

33:32.636 --> 33:34.471
Because I know the stuff.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.640
And I do fine

33:34.471 --> 33:36.640
when it's not timed,

33:36.640 --> 33:37.933
but then it's timed

33:36.640 --> 33:37.933
and I sit there,

33:37.933 --> 33:39.392
and it all just

33:37.933 --> 33:39.392
overwhelms me.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.645
I start thinking what if

33:39.392 --> 33:41.645
I don't have enough time

33:41.645 --> 33:43.229
to finish the logic questions?

33:43.229 --> 33:44.606
And then I start worrying

33:43.229 --> 33:44.606
about the fact

33:44.606 --> 33:46.399
that I wasted all that time

33:44.606 --> 33:46.399
time worrying.

33:46.399 --> 33:48.276
And if I don't finish,

33:46.399 --> 33:48.276
I'll do badly,

33:48.276 --> 33:49.486
and I won't get in anywhere,

33:49.486 --> 33:51.070
or I'll get in

33:49.486 --> 33:51.070
somewhere really crappy.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.906
Won't be able

33:51.070 --> 33:52.906
to get another job,

33:52.906 --> 33:54.115
we'll be in all this debt

33:54.115 --> 33:55.742
and we'll end up homeless.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.996
Michael,

33:55.742 --> 33:58.996
that's not gonna happen.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.080
At least worry

33:58.996 --> 34:01.080
about real things.

34:01.080 --> 34:04.042
NARRATOR:

34:01.080 --> 34:04.042
<i>Like a stress shed?</i>

34:04.042 --> 34:05.544
But I get it.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.588
I go worst-case

34:05.544 --> 34:08.588
scenario, too.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.924
Maybe we should think about

34:08.588 --> 34:10.924
what could actually happen.

34:10.924 --> 34:12.133
Worst case.

34:12.133 --> 34:14.594
Uh... ( sighs )

34:14.594 --> 34:16.763
I fail the test.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.224
I run out of severance,

34:16.763 --> 34:19.224
can't find another job.

34:19.224 --> 34:22.853
And I turn my book in

34:19.224 --> 34:22.853
and completely fail as a writer.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.771
Is that why you haven't

34:22.853 --> 34:24.771
turned it in?

34:24.771 --> 34:27.024
I mean, probably, right?

34:27.024 --> 34:28.817
So I fail, we're broke.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.736
I guess we move in

34:28.817 --> 34:30.736
with your mom and grandma.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.863
Oh, man, that would suck.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.863
So much.

34:32.863 --> 34:34.031
Maybe I could get my mom

34:34.031 --> 34:35.407
to move in with Bruce.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.407
That's good.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.576
Good thinking.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.576
We'll get your<i> abuela</i>

34:37.576 --> 34:39.077
to start dating that guy

34:37.576 --> 34:39.077
from the gift shop

34:39.077 --> 34:40.245
she's been crushing on.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.747
You noticed that, too?

34:40.245 --> 34:41.747
Yes, I have.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.289
So, she'll move in with him.

34:43.289 --> 34:46.251
Wow, just like that,

34:43.289 --> 34:46.251
we're unemployed with a house.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.127
And our home brewery

34:46.251 --> 34:48.127
is really taking off.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.505
( laughs )

34:50.505 --> 34:53.299
I was wrong to push you away.

34:53.299 --> 34:56.011
And I know we have

34:53.299 --> 34:56.011
to figure out

34:56.011 --> 34:58.221
how to deal with stress better

34:56.011 --> 34:58.221
as a couple.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.681
We just...

34:59.681 --> 35:01.767
have to find a way to relax

35:01.767 --> 35:04.686
that reminds us that even

35:01.767 --> 35:04.686
in the worst-case scenario...

35:04.686 --> 35:07.981
we still have

35:04.686 --> 35:07.981
each other, right?

35:07.981 --> 35:09.524
Tent.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.026
Did he just say... ?

35:09.524 --> 35:11.026
Was that... ?

35:11.026 --> 35:13.904
Ti ta tent.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.904
Oh, my God! Yes, Mateo!

35:13.904 --> 35:15.655
Yes! This is a tent.

35:15.655 --> 35:16.823
Whoa!

NARRATOR:

35:16.823 --> 35:18.533

( giggles )

35:21.286 --> 35:24.497
( coughing )

35:21.286 --> 35:24.497
Sorry to cut our trip short,

35:21.286 --> 35:24.497
Raf.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.832
I just don't feel too well.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.250

35:27.250 --> 35:28.251

NARRATOR:

35:36.635 --> 35:38.762
<i>Wait. I thought</i>

35:36.635 --> 35:38.762
<i>he was in the shower.</i>

35:38.762 --> 35:40.513
What are you doing here?

35:38.762 --> 35:40.513
Where are the cameras?

35:40.513 --> 35:41.765
What? What are you

35:40.513 --> 35:41.765
talking about?

35:41.765 --> 35:43.266
NARRATOR:

35:41.765 --> 35:43.266
<i>Oh, that was a set-up.</i>

35:43.266 --> 35:44.726
Cat told me what you said.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.726
Rafael, come on.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.311
The only way

35:44.726 --> 35:46.311
you could have known...

35:46.311 --> 35:47.437
Don't be paranoid.

35:47.437 --> 35:48.855
is if there were cameras.

35:47.437 --> 35:48.855
Rafael--

35:48.855 --> 35:50.189
Rafael!

35:51.357 --> 35:53.568
What the hell is this?

35:53.568 --> 35:55.487
Well, you had cameras first.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.487
Petra.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.655
You did, in the teddy bear.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.948
Because I thought

35:56.655 --> 35:57.948
it wasn't you.

35:57.948 --> 36:00.533
Exactly!

35:57.948 --> 36:00.533
Because I was paralyzed!

36:00.533 --> 36:02.035
Do you understand?

36:02.035 --> 36:04.454
I was paralyzed

36:02.035 --> 36:04.454
and I was forced to lie there

36:04.454 --> 36:08.000
and listen to what everybody

36:04.454 --> 36:08.000
really thought and-and said.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.876
And things are different now.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.420
I-I can't even tell

36:09.876 --> 36:12.420
what's real and what's not.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.297
But with the cameras I can.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.297
I can go back. I can...

36:14.297 --> 36:16.716
I can rewind,

36:14.297 --> 36:16.716
I can make sure. Petra.

36:16.716 --> 36:20.720
If you're looking for the will,

36:16.716 --> 36:20.720
it's over. I destroyed it.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.852
Why would you

36:25.266 --> 36:26.852
destroy the will?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.063
I had to.

36:30.063 --> 36:31.439
For the babies.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.108
It's the only thing

36:31.439 --> 36:33.108
I can do.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.318
We just started to bond.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.862
Do you remember

36:35.318 --> 36:36.862
when she paralyzed me?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.780
( squealing and laughing )

36:40.991 --> 36:42.283
( gasps )

36:46.705 --> 36:49.958
( crying ):

36:46.705 --> 36:49.958
They don't know me now.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.210
They cry when I hold them.

36:52.210 --> 36:56.131
But the money,

36:52.210 --> 36:56.131
I can help with the money,

36:56.131 --> 36:57.924
with you

36:56.131 --> 36:57.924
not losing your money.

36:57.924 --> 36:58.967
Hey, hey.

37:01.386 --> 37:04.347
( sighs )

37:01.386 --> 37:04.347
You're gonna be okay, Petra.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.728
You're gonna be okay.

37:09.728 --> 37:13.565
Right now...

37:09.728 --> 37:13.565
everything...

37:13.565 --> 37:15.150
just feels...

37:15.150 --> 37:16.609
MICHAEL:

37:15.150 --> 37:16.609
Like it's gonna work out.

37:16.609 --> 37:19.654
There's something

37:16.609 --> 37:19.654
about the big open sky.

37:19.654 --> 37:23.408
Our problems just seem

37:19.654 --> 37:23.408
so insignificant.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.951
Exactly.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.745
That's why

37:24.951 --> 37:26.745
I love camping.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.956
So maybe this is what we'll do.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.956
To de-stress.

37:29.956 --> 37:33.001
I don't know

37:29.956 --> 37:33.001
if I'd go that far.

39:32.954 --> 39:37.375
I agreed to help her before
