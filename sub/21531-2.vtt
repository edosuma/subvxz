WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:07.208
Okay, look at this picture.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.509
I-If you look at it closely,

00:09.610 --> 00:12.046
I swear you can see Katie Holmes
mouthing, "Help me."

00:14.648 --> 00:17.785
Please.
She made her own twin beds.

00:20.154 --> 00:23.657
Oh, God.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.127
Oh, my God, you're home.
I'll just come back later.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.696
Wait a minute. Wait.
W-What's with the hand truck?

00:28.796 --> 00:30.231
It's not what it looks like.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.766
I just came
to take your sofa.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.502
Why do you need
our sofa?

00:34.602 --> 00:36.036
Well, I really wanted
to do something

00:36.137 --> 00:37.271
to spruce up my talk show,

00:37.371 --> 00:39.573
'cause I have
a really exciting guest.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.076
Even better than the guest
on my first episode.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.777
Better than a moustache
drawn on your hand

00:43.877 --> 00:47.315
that you said
was Lou Diamond Phillips?

00:47.415 --> 00:49.450
I find that
hard to believe.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.152
Oh. Okay.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.620
Well, there's somebody

00:52.720 --> 00:56.257
who's not gonna get to meet
Harrison Ford!

00:56.357 --> 00:58.226
And there's somebody else

00:58.326 --> 01:00.728
who's not gonna get
to meet Harrison Ford.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.063
Anyway, Grace...

01:03.164 --> 01:05.799
would you like
to help me with my set?

01:05.899 --> 01:08.236
I asked the art department
to spruce it up,

01:08.336 --> 01:09.170
but they're all lesbians,

01:09.270 --> 01:11.739
and I feel like
it needs a woman's touch.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.574
Sure, Jack.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.843
But you should know better
than to stereotype lesbians.

01:15.943 --> 01:19.847
Ooh, while I'm there, I can
have one of them fix my watch.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.081
[door opening]

01:21.182 --> 01:22.116
(Karen)
Hey, kids.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.384
Just stopped by
to say hi.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.519
You live here now.
I never want to see you again.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.820
See ya later!

01:28.456 --> 01:31.091
Karen, what--what
are you doing?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.827
She still won't forgive me
for knowing Mr. Stan was alive.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.229
And she'll come to realize

01:35.329 --> 01:37.831
that I only did it
because I love her!

01:37.931 --> 01:40.434
Or when she needs
a bong buddy.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.774
Well, here it is.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.643
Everything she had
when I first brought her home.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.445
A doll made out of sticks,

01:51.545 --> 01:52.880
a moth-eaten blanket,

01:52.980 --> 01:55.183
and her degree
in Clinical Psychology

01:55.283 --> 01:57.518
from the University of Texas.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.789
Karen.
Rosie can't live with us.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.158
Why?

02:04.258 --> 02:06.760
Because she's black, Grace?

02:10.431 --> 02:14.202
Karen, she can stay
for a few days.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.703
But sooner or later,

02:15.803 --> 02:18.872
you're gonna have to deal
with what happened with Stan.

02:18.972 --> 02:19.840
What?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.309
Honey, I'm fine.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.843
I'm moving on with my life.

02:22.943 --> 02:27.715
I'm dating Malcolm,
I've joined Curves.

02:27.815 --> 02:31.352
Oh! And I finally got
into the Harry Potter books.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.521
You know, I say
I root for Gryffindor,

02:33.621 --> 02:35.756
but secretly I love
my Slytherin boys.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.790
Ha ha.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.902
[violin playing]

02:53.741 --> 02:56.577
That was heartbreaking,
Harumi.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.547
You are
an extraordinary talent.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.515
Arigato!

03:01.615 --> 03:02.916
Oh, and by the way,

03:03.016 --> 03:04.318
somebody threw up
on the radiator

03:04.418 --> 03:05.919
next to the toilet again.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.921
It's pretty baked on,

03:08.021 --> 03:11.725
but you can probably scrape
most of it off with your bow.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.798
[knocking]
Hey, Karen.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.500
Hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.402
Although, considering
this is a 17-bedroom mansion,

03:21.502 --> 03:23.504
should you really leave
the front door unlocked?

03:23.604 --> 03:26.206
Eh. What is there
to take in here?

03:26.307 --> 03:28.342
Well, it's not so much
what might get stolen

03:28.442 --> 03:32.246
as--as how many of your staff
might try to escape.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.852
Look...

03:38.952 --> 03:41.922
I'm--I'm worried
that you're not dealing

03:42.022 --> 03:44.725
with this whole
Stan being alive thing.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.261
I think you're in denial
about your feelings.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.562
Wait a minute.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.999
You're using psychiatry on me.

03:52.099 --> 03:57.571
I've read all the studies
on psychiatry. Have you?

04:01.609 --> 04:06.880
It's a pseudo science
and it doesn't exist.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.684
And neither do postpartum
depression or Brooke Shields.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.023
Karen.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.559
You don't have to put up
a wall with me.

04:18.659 --> 04:22.696
I've seen you
punching coat check girls...

04:22.796 --> 04:25.599
swallowing buttons
you thought were pills...

04:25.699 --> 04:28.969
shooting at the birds
in your wallpaper.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.905
So come on, talk to me.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.841
I don't know.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.042
Come on!

04:36.043 --> 04:37.378
Start taking that wall down
one brick at a time.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.412
Come on,
just one brick.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.714
Just one.
Yeah.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.916
Come on.
I'm right beside you.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.485
Take that brick down.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.786
Now, what do you see?

04:45.886 --> 04:49.557
[screams]
Oh! Okay, back, back.
B-B-Back.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.026
Too quick.
My fault.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.396
I shouldn't have
pushed you that hard.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.864
And please, swear to me

04:56.964 --> 04:59.066
you'll never tell me
what was behind that brick.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.070
Are you crying?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.975
Honey, I missed Stanley
so much.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.744
Now I find out
that he's alive

05:10.844 --> 05:13.013
and that he lied to me.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.683
It hurts, Will.

05:15.783 --> 05:19.853
I feel empty
and confused and...

05:19.953 --> 05:23.924
even more alone than I did
when I thought he was dead.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.560
Karen, c'mere.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.795
C'mere.

05:27.895 --> 05:28.962
[crying]

05:29.062 --> 05:32.032
You just let it all out.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.401
That's it.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.639
Now, you feel better?
[sniffling]

05:38.739 --> 05:41.341
[loud sobbing]
Okay, not yet.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.512
Not--Not yet.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.715
You take all the time
you need.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.787
[Karen sobbing]

06:07.468 --> 06:08.736
(Grace)
I'm sorry, Jack.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.571
I thought I'd have
more time before the show.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.939
No, Grace.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.707
This is great!

06:13.807 --> 06:14.775
Thank you.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.477
No, it just needed, uh,

06:16.577 --> 06:18.679
you know,
a touch of elegance.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.714
Ooh!
Hello, LifeSaver.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.150
What?
I'm not gonna eat it.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.122
I wonder what else
is in here.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.091
Uh, Jack.
We have a problem.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.126
Uh, if you got somebody
pregnant, straighty,

06:33.226 --> 06:35.963
that's your problem,
not mine.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.465
We don't have Harrison Ford.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.832
What?!

06:38.932 --> 06:40.968
Why would you swear we had him
if we didn't have him?

06:41.068 --> 06:43.070
Because you said if we didn't
have him, I'd be fired.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.674
Ugh! Okay, I probably
shouldn't have said that.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.976
Just don't let it
happen again, okay?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.110
Now.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.713
Do we have Angelina Jolie
for tomorrow?

06:52.813 --> 06:55.516
If you say no,
you're fired.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.417
She's super excited
to meet you.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.952
Great. Okay.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.789
Crap! What am I gonna do
for a guest?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.724
We're on in five, four,

07:03.824 --> 07:06.694
three, two...

07:06.794 --> 07:09.029
Welcome to Jack Talk.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.800
Today's guest,
interior designer Grace Adler.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.836
[applause]

07:20.641 --> 07:21.809
All right, settle down,
ladies.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.678
It's not like I brought
Judy back to life.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.680
[clears throat]

07:26.780 --> 07:30.551
Thanks for being
on the show, Grace.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.720
What the hell's
goin' on?
[laughs]

07:32.820 --> 07:34.822
Isn't she hilarious?

07:34.922 --> 07:36.056
Hey, Kathy Griffin!

07:36.156 --> 07:37.725
You're not the only
funny redhead over 40!

07:37.825 --> 07:39.593
[dings bell]

07:42.863 --> 07:44.164
I think I'm gonna go.

07:44.264 --> 07:47.200
Hey, um, here's a fun fact
about Grace.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.902
Um, she lives with a gay man.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.704
[audience oohing]

07:52.305 --> 07:54.074
Oh, yeah.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.044
Um, yeah, I have
for a while.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.212
He's been my best friend
for years.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.250
[applause]

08:03.350 --> 08:05.886
Thank you.
[laughing]

08:05.986 --> 08:09.256
I'm also, um, very involved
in the New York gay scene.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.924
That's right.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.493
Grace has closed more gay bars
than the Department of Health.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.095
[dings bell]

08:18.632 --> 08:20.768
Ah, like my mother
always says,

08:20.868 --> 08:24.237
If you love gay men so much,
why don't you just marry one?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.674
Believe me, I tried.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.712
Sounds like you love
everything about gay men.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.013
Not true.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.214
Jack Talk audience,

08:34.314 --> 08:38.185
can I speak seriously
for just a moment?

08:38.285 --> 08:42.022
There is one thing
I don't like.

08:42.122 --> 08:45.225
I don't like gay men

08:45.325 --> 08:49.863
who don't like themselves.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.566
[audience murmuring]

08:52.666 --> 08:54.635
Well, I could listen
to you talk forever.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.003
I could.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.639
But who wants to watch me
make a protein shake?

08:58.739 --> 09:01.675
[cheers and applause]

09:06.313 --> 09:08.716
What did you do to me?

09:08.816 --> 09:11.284
Uh...healed you?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.120
Do I look healed to you?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.554
You took a few bricks out,

09:14.655 --> 09:18.558
and the whole
damn building collapsed!

09:18.659 --> 09:19.793
I can't eat,

09:19.893 --> 09:20.861
I can't sleep.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.195
Yesterday I was so upset,

09:22.295 --> 09:23.697
I walked into the Mercer Hotel

09:23.797 --> 09:27.234
and threw a phone
at the front desk clerk.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.903
Karen, I-I'm sorry,

09:30.003 --> 09:31.905
but if you wanna get--
Get away from me!

09:32.005 --> 09:33.306
I wanna be alone,

09:33.406 --> 09:36.309
Haven't felt this emotionally
raw and exposed

09:36.409 --> 09:38.211
since Penthouse published
those photos

09:38.311 --> 09:40.313
of me and Vanessa Williams.

09:44.017 --> 09:48.355
Um, do you think Grace
would mind if I borrowed this?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.961
That's mine.

09:57.330 --> 10:01.835
[phone ringing]

10:01.935 --> 10:02.936
Hello?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.304
Grace, where are you?

10:05.505 --> 10:06.740
Why aren't you watchin'
Jack Talk?
I am.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.008
I'm getting my hair done,

10:08.041 --> 10:10.177
but I've got channel 749
on right now.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.112
Guys, when you hear
what I said about gays,

10:12.212 --> 10:13.814
I think you're gonna be
pretty happy.

10:13.914 --> 10:17.150
Maybe free hot oil treatment
happy.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.686
All right, Grace, look,
I gotta go.

10:18.786 --> 10:19.987
I can hear myself
through the phone,

10:20.087 --> 10:21.689
on your TV, on Will's TV,
in my head--

10:21.789 --> 10:23.691
It's too much of a good thing.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.158
Oh, here comes
my serious moment.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.359
Turn it up, Hector.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.963
Can I speak seriously
for just a moment?

10:30.063 --> 10:31.665
There is one thing
I don't like.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.168
I don't like gay men.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.205
[machine whirring]

10:51.051 --> 10:53.120
You know,
it's kinda weird.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.255
The way that episode
was edited,

10:55.355 --> 10:59.026
it almost makes it seem
like Grace hates gay men.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.064
Do you think she noticed?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.134
I'm sure it's fine.

11:07.234 --> 11:11.939
I just hope you're okay
with having only one testicle.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.449
Simba looks angry.

11:29.089 --> 11:35.095
I hate gays?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.096
Yeah, I know, Grace.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.132
You said it on my show,
remember?

11:39.232 --> 11:41.101
Do you have any idea
what I have been through?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.070
On my way over here

11:43.170 --> 11:46.173
I was egged
in the East Village,

11:46.273 --> 11:51.211
egg whited in the West Village,

11:51.311 --> 11:53.246
and in Chelsea,

11:53.346 --> 11:55.382
some vicious queen

11:55.482 --> 11:57.450
threw a skinless
chicken breast at me

11:57.550 --> 12:00.253
as he rollerbladed by!

12:00.353 --> 12:03.156
I'm sorry, Grace!

12:03.256 --> 12:04.758
The show ran crazy long.

12:04.858 --> 12:05.826
I had to cut something

12:06.693 --> 12:07.961
if I wanted to keep
my full four minutes

12:07.995 --> 12:09.362
of me makin' that shake.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.867
Ugh!

12:13.967 --> 12:16.103
Okay!

12:16.203 --> 12:18.105
See, that makes sense,

12:18.205 --> 12:20.273
now that I know
the context...

12:20.373 --> 12:21.141
Uh-huh.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.175
Right.
Yeah!

12:22.275 --> 12:23.210
It's almost kinda funny,
right?

12:23.310 --> 12:25.512
Kinda?
It's hilarious!

12:25.612 --> 12:26.413
I mean, look!

12:26.513 --> 12:29.282
I paid 200 bucks for this!
[laughing]

12:29.382 --> 12:32.953
Stick a pencil up your ass,
you're a troll doll!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.924
So good show, right?
Yeah.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.359
Yeah, yeah. C'mere,
lemme give you a little hug.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.761
[spits]
Uh!

12:41.862 --> 12:44.064
[coughs]

12:44.164 --> 12:45.365
I'm beginning to think

12:45.465 --> 12:48.168
you're not taking
this so well.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.904
I am not homophobic,

12:51.004 --> 12:53.440
you mincing little squirrel.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.844
So here's what you're
gonna do, Alice.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.212
You're gonna put me
on your next show

12:59.312 --> 13:01.281
so I can clear my name.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.515
I can't.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.518
Have Angelina Jolie.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.455
[Jack screaming]

13:11.424 --> 13:15.295
Smitty, do you ever think
about giving up?

13:15.395 --> 13:16.563
You know,

13:16.663 --> 13:19.066
just ending it all.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.901
Funny you should ask.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.271
Tonight's the anniversary
of the fire

13:24.371 --> 13:26.573
that killed my identical twin,

13:26.673 --> 13:29.209
and I've never felt
more alone.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.218
Now, how is it

13:38.318 --> 13:39.953
that you're tending bar,

13:40.053 --> 13:41.989
and Jimmy Kimmel
has his own show?

13:42.089 --> 13:44.424
It's just not right.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.195
There you are.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.530
Ugh.
Get lost, Wilma.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.232
Thanks to you,

13:52.332 --> 13:55.302
I've got all these
awful memories flooding back.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.405
My dog getting hit
by a car.

13:58.505 --> 14:03.944
My three-legged dog
getting hit by a slower car.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.279
My dog...

14:06.379 --> 14:07.614
on a little cart,

14:07.714 --> 14:11.985
rolling under a school bus.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.521
Look, as hard as it is
to remember these things,

14:14.621 --> 14:16.990
dealing with them
is how you heal.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.127
Was this all the same dog?

14:20.227 --> 14:22.495
W-Why wasn't he on a leash?

14:22.595 --> 14:25.933
Deal with things?

14:26.033 --> 14:29.602
Who are you to talk
about dealing with things?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.404
What do you mean?
I deal.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.872
Oh, please.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.875
You're zipped up tighter
than Star Jones in a...

14:35.976 --> 14:39.379
well, really,
anything with a zipper.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.953
That's why you spend
all of your time

14:46.053 --> 14:47.287
fixing everybody else's
problems,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.422
so you don't have to
look at your own.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.257
That's crap.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.325
Really?

14:52.425 --> 14:53.994
Then why don't we take

14:54.094 --> 14:56.029
a few little bricks
out of Will's wall, huh?

14:56.129 --> 14:57.430
Go ahead.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.066
But you're not gonna find
anything back there,

14:59.166 --> 15:01.334
'cause when something comes
into my life, I tend to it.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.103
Then move on.
Mm.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.404
So you don't keep
the remnants

15:04.504 --> 15:07.074
of your career back there?

15:07.174 --> 15:09.042
I quit my job

15:09.142 --> 15:10.443
to do something meaningful.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.146
And how's that goin' for ya?

15:16.683 --> 15:19.486
It takes time
to find the right thing.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.988
Oh.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.623
Well, apparently,
that applies to boyfriends too,

15:23.656 --> 15:24.291
because the only man
that you've had

15:25.225 --> 15:27.927
a successful relationship
with is Grace.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.366
I've had tons
of successful relationships.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.601
That all ended.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.270
Successfully!

15:37.370 --> 15:39.306
Well, I'm glad

15:39.406 --> 15:41.408
you've got it
all figured out, Will.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.443
Because, if I were you,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.145
I'd be worried.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.314
Oh, yeah?
Well, don't be.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.483
'Cause what I have
is a fresh start.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.185
It's exciting,
actually, you know?

15:52.285 --> 15:55.322
I'm--I-I'm unemployed,
I'm single, I'm 41.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.090
The world is my--

15:57.190 --> 15:58.658
Oh, just put me
in a little cart

15:58.758 --> 16:01.594
and roll me
under a school bus.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.069
Hi, I'm Jack McFarland!
Welcome to Jack Talk!

16:09.169 --> 16:11.238
Today I have

16:11.338 --> 16:15.408
my exclusive follow-up
interview with Grace Adler.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.610
Woman misunderstood
or homophobic monster?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.079
Let's give her a warm welcome.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.381
[audience booing and hissing]

16:21.481 --> 16:23.283
Okay, all right.
All right.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.351
Hey! Give her a chance!

16:24.451 --> 16:26.053
She hasn't even
sat down yet.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.420
Okay?

16:27.520 --> 16:28.755
Now, I need to correct

16:28.855 --> 16:31.024
an editing mistake
from yesterday.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.725
I've known little Grace Adler
here for many, many years,

16:32.825 --> 16:34.061
and she is not
a homophobe.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.762
I'm not.
Yes, you are.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.530
Yes, you are!
[booing]

16:37.630 --> 16:38.731
(Jack)
Hey, hey!

16:38.831 --> 16:40.433
Hey, hey, hey!
All right, hey, now.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.369
Let's take a deep breath,
okay?

16:42.469 --> 16:43.536
[breathing in]

16:44.504 --> 16:45.672
Oh, Grace, I think you broke
a rib yesterday

16:45.772 --> 16:47.107
when you attacked me.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.408
[audience booing]

16:48.508 --> 16:50.443
No, no.
I was--I was hugging him.

16:50.543 --> 16:54.281
[booing and yelling]

16:54.381 --> 16:56.049
Oh, shut up!

16:56.149 --> 16:58.485
Shut up!

17:00.487 --> 17:02.155
Shame on you!

17:03.423 --> 17:05.525
Bad queens!

17:05.625 --> 17:08.461
Bad queens!

17:08.561 --> 17:11.698
Do you even know
who you're booing?

17:11.798 --> 17:13.300
I have been

17:13.400 --> 17:16.035
devoted to you
for decades.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.571
When I was a little girl,

17:18.671 --> 17:22.709
I showed you mine
when you showed me yours.

17:22.809 --> 17:26.379
Even though you didn't care.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.148
When I was in high school,

17:28.248 --> 17:30.117
I showed you mine
when you showed me yours,

17:30.217 --> 17:32.219
even though you didn't care.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.554
And when I was in my 20s,

17:34.654 --> 17:36.223
I slept with you,

17:36.323 --> 17:39.726
even though you still
didn't care!

17:39.826 --> 17:42.662
And now you sneer at me

17:42.762 --> 17:44.431
at the Chelsea Market?

17:44.531 --> 17:47.367
And you--you throw
macaroni salad at me

17:47.467 --> 17:49.202
on Christopher Street?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.838
And it's so not fair.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.840
'Cause I love you people.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.675
I have always

17:55.775 --> 17:57.244
loved you

17:57.344 --> 18:01.581
in a very unhealthy way.

18:03.650 --> 18:09.289
For my own personal development.

18:09.389 --> 18:13.726
So now love me back, dammit!

18:13.826 --> 18:16.763
[cheers and applause]

18:20.300 --> 18:21.634
(Will)
You seem fine.

18:21.734 --> 18:26.506
Why are you so drank when we
together the same amount?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.541
Honey, you don't look so good.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.644
Not so much fun peeking
behind the wall, is it?

18:31.744 --> 18:33.413
No.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.283
People like us, we should
just leave the walls up

18:36.383 --> 18:39.319
and all the feelings
on the other side.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.588
What do you say we start

18:41.688 --> 18:44.391
stacking those bricks
back up, huh?

18:44.491 --> 18:46.226
Good idea.
Okay.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.428
Me first.
Um...

18:48.528 --> 18:51.498
Oh, the time that
the football team caught me

18:51.598 --> 18:53.566
kissing that poster

18:53.666 --> 18:56.303
of the football team.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.775
Never happened.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.212
My eighth birthday,
which my mother celebrated

19:05.312 --> 19:08.515
by changing my name
and moving us to Vancouver.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.616
Good-bye!

19:09.716 --> 19:10.650
Mm.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.252
Ooh, or the time

19:12.352 --> 19:14.454
that I told my first boyfriend
I loved him,

19:14.554 --> 19:18.391
and he said,
"Did you just eat falafel?"

19:20.727 --> 19:22.662
Doesn't hurt.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.731
The horrible, muffled cries

19:24.831 --> 19:28.468
of Patty Hearst
from behind that closet door.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.373
Never happened.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.543
Oh, what about--

19:36.643 --> 19:38.645
what about Stan coming back?

19:38.745 --> 19:41.248
That's--That's a big,
old brick.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.449
Yeah.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.550
I think I need

19:43.650 --> 19:45.485
to leave that one
out for a while.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.819
Really?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.355
Well, it hurts,

19:48.455 --> 19:52.659
but I may need
to take a peek again.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.627
Huh.

19:54.727 --> 19:58.498
I'll leave one out too.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.200
I had the perfect guy
and the perfect job,

20:01.301 --> 20:03.736
and I threw it all away.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.373
Honey, I said leave out
a brick,

20:06.473 --> 20:09.476
not blow out an archway.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.680
But you know,

20:13.780 --> 20:15.915
I do feel
a little better.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.216
Yeah?

20:17.317 --> 20:18.618
I'm glad.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.587
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.922
Okay.
Second door on your left.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.524
Harumi.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.459
Get your violin and spatula

20:26.559 --> 20:30.530
and meet Mr. Truman
in the john.

20:33.032 --> 20:36.303
(Grace on TV)
Love me back, dammit!

20:36.403 --> 20:39.439
[audience applauding]

20:39.539 --> 20:41.941
Wow.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.344
And that was my fourth take.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.446
I'm sorry
we had to keep doing it.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.880
Stupid sound man.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.951
New rule: you gotta be
at least 13 to work on a show.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.521
Wait a minute.
You did that four times?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.323
Mm-hmm.
How did you remember it?

20:56.423 --> 20:57.390
Oh, please.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.791
Any hag worth her salt

20:58.891 --> 21:02.895
has that speech ready to go
for the day you guys turn.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.932
Wanna hear it in Spanish?

21:06.032 --> 21:10.470
[speaking Spanish]

21:10.570 --> 21:10.670
No soy un homophobe.
