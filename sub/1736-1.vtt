<i>Come on, come on, came on.</i>

02:35.236 --> 02:37.079
Francis Kelly!

03:16.818 --> 03:19.287
Here you go.
That's everything.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.660
Yeah, that's my brother.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.245
Hey, Frankie.

03:31.942 --> 03:34.161
Frankie, see ya in a couple months.

03:34.859 --> 03:37.578
Yeah, I'll pay your mom
a visit in the meantime.

03:47.984 --> 03:53.836
- I'm a free motherfucker.
- Here he is.

03:55.567 --> 03:56.533
What's up, man?

03:56.608 --> 03:58.656
- What up, Frankie?
- What up, Sugar?

03:58.858 --> 04:02.533
I'm a free motherfucker!
Oh, shit. You got my hat.

04:03.441 --> 04:06.365
Yeah, Frankie's back, baby.
Frankie's back.

04:06.566 --> 04:08.364
- Frankie's back. My man.
- What's up!

05:07.064 --> 05:08.566
Come on, Frankie.

05:09.272 --> 05:11.695
Come on, boy. You go.
Watch your head, hm.

05:20.272 --> 05:23.243
Oh, shit.
Oh, Ray, man.

05:24.022 --> 05:26.866
This is your place, bro?
Oh, man.

05:27.022 --> 05:32.199
Yo, dude, this fucking girl tonight, bro,
this fucking pussy was like--

05:33.230 --> 05:35.823
- Bro, what--
- Where's his brother?

05:39.188 --> 05:41.190
Can somebody get that?

05:43.104 --> 05:46.074
James, grab the phone!

05:59.229 --> 06:01.152
Lewis's Auto.

06:02.937 --> 06:04.655
Yeah, I'm James Kelly.

06:11.187 --> 06:14.011
Yeah, well, I thought it was
your mandate or whatever...

06:14.103 --> 06:16.197
to support small business with loans.

06:20.020 --> 06:21.863
Yeah, no, I understand.

06:24.561 --> 06:26.304
No, man, I don't have a degree.

06:26.395 --> 06:28.567
And I don't really
see how that matters much.

06:31.144 --> 06:32.988
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

06:33.728 --> 06:37.153
All right, all right.
Thanks for your time, man.

06:37.769 --> 06:38.770
Asshole.

06:47.727 --> 06:48.728
Fuck.

07:01.143 --> 07:03.817
Hey, Joe! I got this.

07:13.726 --> 07:14.852
Emily.

07:18.684 --> 07:20.027
James Kelly.

07:26.101 --> 07:28.675
I thought you moved away after Katrina.

07:28.767 --> 07:33.047
I did, but soon as I could
get work, I came back.

07:33.142 --> 07:34.815
Oh, yeah?
What do you do?

07:34.934 --> 07:37.232
I'm a dispatcher for the NOPD.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.772
Really?

07:42.184 --> 07:45.438
- What, so you're like a cop or something?
- No, I'm not a cop.

07:45.767 --> 07:48.441
I'm a glorified operator.

07:49.642 --> 07:50.768
That's cool.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.147
You kind of disappeared.

08:02.766 --> 08:07.602
Yeah, yeah. No, I know.
I went traveling.

08:08.058 --> 08:10.731
I was traveling abroad
for a little bit, you know.

08:10.807 --> 08:13.937
Really? 'Cause I thought maybe
you got abducted by aliens...

08:14.057 --> 08:17.231
or started working for the CIA or,
I don't know, went to prison.

08:19.224 --> 08:23.274
Actually, yes.
I used to be a secret agent for the CIA.

08:23.432 --> 08:25.434
But on very top secret missions.

08:25.557 --> 08:28.982
But that was a long time ago and
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

08:32.265 --> 08:33.892
Come here for a second.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.150
- You live nearby?
- Not far.

08:38.972 --> 08:41.442
- Got a garage at your place?
- Sure.

08:42.431 --> 08:44.149
Look, this...

08:44.973 --> 08:47.817
this shop, it's, you know, too high priced.

08:50.014 --> 08:54.100
If you want,
I could just fix your car at your place...

08:54.181 --> 08:55.353
and you don't gotta pay me for my time.

08:55.431 --> 09:00.608
I'll pass along new parts at cost
and I'll save you a couple bucks.

09:01.389 --> 09:04.142
That is very sweet of you.

09:06.306 --> 09:08.058
Least I could do.

10:02.387 --> 10:04.515
So this guy goes to prison

10:06.762 --> 10:09.106
and they lock him down in a cell.

10:10.012 --> 10:11.889
Two-man room.

10:12.511 --> 10:15.961
He looks in and he sees there's
a big 350-pound black guy...

10:16.053 --> 10:18.977
just sitting there mean-muggin' him.

10:22.053 --> 10:25.557
Black guy says, "Say, man,

10:26.094 --> 10:30.224
you wanna be the mama
or you wanna be the daddy?"

10:32.386 --> 10:34.505
The guy says, "Excuse me?"

10:34.594 --> 10:37.313
He said, "Did I stu... stu...
stutter, motherfucker?"

10:37.552 --> 10:42.011
I say, 'You wanna to be the
mama or you wanna the daddy?

10:44.552 --> 10:48.227
Guy says, "Well, I'll be the daddy."

10:48.969 --> 10:52.518
He said, "Fine. You the daddy."

10:54.385 --> 10:57.389
Come over here and
suck on mama's dick.

11:01.385 --> 11:05.435
Come on, Jim. Come on, man.
It's been 10 years.

11:05.593 --> 11:08.221
You can do better than that, no?

11:10.259 --> 11:13.230
You got some fucking balls
showing up here, man.

11:14.884 --> 11:17.604
What's the matter, Jimmy?
I came to see you.

11:18.926 --> 11:20.599
You didn't come to see me.

11:22.217 --> 11:24.936
Whatever happened to me
and you against the world, huh?

11:25.634 --> 11:28.513
- You want to know what happened, Frankie?
- Yeah, what happened?

11:28.675 --> 11:30.243
- You want to know what happened?
- Yeah, what happened?

11:30.300 --> 11:32.473
Yeah?
I'll tell you what happened.

11:32.967 --> 11:35.766
You fucking turned the world against me.

11:36.009 --> 11:37.886
You still crying about that?

11:38.800 --> 11:41.178
That's life, buddy.
Shit ain't fair.

11:50.925 --> 11:51.720
Fuck!

11:53.008 --> 11:55.103
Hey, all right, all right, all right!

11:55.299 --> 11:58.633
Don't act crazy, come on.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry!

11:58.716 --> 12:00.468
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:01.383 --> 12:03.636
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:05.132 --> 12:05.975
I'm sorry.

12:09.299 --> 12:10.300
I'm sorry.

12:18.299 --> 12:20.427
Ah, shit, Jimmy.

12:21.299 --> 12:22.891
Shit, Frankie.

12:25.715 --> 12:27.809
Let's go get a drink, huh?

12:28.757 --> 12:30.976
Come on, let's go grab a drink.

12:32.298 --> 12:34.096
I can't tonight.

12:38.798 --> 12:40.015
Tomorrow.

12:52.672 --> 12:56.472
- You're prompt.
- I like to keep my appointments.

12:57.881 --> 12:59.883
Not what I recall.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.091
What happened to your eye?

13:02.630 --> 13:04.349
- Oh, it was just a--
- You know what? I--

13:05.047 --> 13:06.799
All good, it's not my business.

13:11.338 --> 13:13.966
So, I'm guessing you have tools?

13:14.047 --> 13:18.005
Yeah, yeah. In my car.
You got the keys?

13:18.130 --> 13:18.926
Yeah.

13:24.421 --> 13:27.721
It's very sweet of you to do this.
Really.

13:31.213 --> 13:34.763
I think I owe you.

13:36.463 --> 13:38.215
It's a long time ago, James.

13:38.546 --> 13:40.469
I'll be inside if you need me.

13:41.212 --> 13:42.179
All right.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.504
How's it going out there?

14:39.460 --> 14:42.304
It looks like someone put
sugar in your gas tank.

14:42.627 --> 14:44.997
- You're kidding.
- No.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.589
Probably just some bored kids.
You park in bad neighborhoods?

14:48.710 --> 14:52.089
I won't ever again.
Can you fix it?

14:52.168 --> 14:54.762
Yeah, yeah, sure.
It's fixable, it's just--

14:55.085 --> 14:58.054
It was gummed up pretty bad, so
I'm gonna have to replace the fuel filter...

14:58.126 --> 15:00.299
but we got a bunch of
those kicking around the shop...

15:00.543 --> 15:02.571
and clean out your gas tank,
which will take me a bit of time.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.386
But the worst part is
you're gonna need a new carburetor, so...

15:05.459 --> 15:07.587
I'm gonna go back
and order one of those tonight.

15:09.918 --> 15:11.635
Guess I'll see you tomorrow then.

15:12.167 --> 15:13.339
Guess so.

15:14.417 --> 15:18.092
All right, I'm gonna go lock up.
You have yourself a good night.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.090
Okay, you, too.

15:54.791 --> 15:57.444
Mr. Kelly, I'm afraid there's
been a misunderstanding.

15:57.541 --> 16:01.216
This is not the type of loan
that's attractive to us right now.

16:01.291 --> 16:04.215
Well, if you could just
take a look at what I got here.

16:04.499 --> 16:07.378
You know, you might
find it a little interesting.

16:07.499 --> 16:11.709
I've done the research and,
look, the area needs another auto shop.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.008
All right?  Here look.
This is my location right here.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.209
There's like 10,000 cars
that go around this circle.

16:16.373 --> 16:19.344
It's a prime spot.
It makes perfect sense.

16:20.082 --> 16:24.258
Here, look. This is it right here,
and it's just sitting there empty.

16:24.457 --> 16:26.003
I'm not looking for that much cash.

16:26.165 --> 16:27.942
<i>Just enough to cover
the rent for 7, 8 months</i>

16:28.023 --> 16:29.295
and then I'll start turning a profit.

16:29.415 --> 16:33.419
And my business plan,
it's good, all right?

16:33.540 --> 16:35.793
You just gotta take a look at it,
but I promise you...

16:35.914 --> 16:37.336
Frankly, Mr. Kelly

16:38.206 --> 16:40.834
we don't make small
business loans anymore.

16:50.622 --> 16:51.669
All right.

16:52.414 --> 16:54.883
Well, what the hell do you guys do?

16:56.705 --> 16:59.254
You know what? Never mind,
all right? I'm sorry.

17:02.747 --> 17:06.547
It's just your Johnny-on-the-spot
with those overdraft fees.

17:16.454 --> 17:17.455
Yo!

17:18.163 --> 17:21.791
I can't believe this place
is still in business, man. Come here.

17:21.913 --> 17:24.665
Yo, let me get another Jamison's.
Two.

17:24.746 --> 17:26.339
Two, for me and my brother.

17:26.829 --> 17:31.084
My brother, huh?
How you been, Jimmy?

17:31.829 --> 17:35.038
It's James now, all right?
People don't call me Jimmy no more.

17:35.287 --> 17:38.336
Okay, James.

17:38.537 --> 17:40.084
You all grown up now?

17:41.787 --> 17:43.585
Look, I know you're upset.

17:43.995 --> 17:45.542
You got a right to be.

17:46.579 --> 17:48.376
It's just, I figured all
this time, you know?

17:48.495 --> 17:50.668
Yeah?
What did you figure, Frankie?

17:51.078 --> 17:53.877
What did you figure, man?
You'd come back and what?

17:55.412 --> 17:57.505
I went to jail, Frankie.

17:58.911 --> 18:02.620
Bro, you got off easy with
16 months. I did 10 years.

18:04.995 --> 18:07.042
Every day I was in there

18:08.119 --> 18:10.999
every fucking day, Jimmy,
I thought about you, man.

18:12.119 --> 18:14.497
I'm sorry, man.
I want to make amends.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.543
- It's not so easy, Frankie.
- I know, I know.

18:18.369 --> 18:19.587
I know.

18:20.161 --> 18:22.504
Jimmy, I'm so proud of you,
bro, really.

18:22.577 --> 18:24.454
I'm proud of you.
You're a fucking good-looking kid.

18:24.619 --> 18:27.247
I mean, I don't know who Mom fucked,
but you lucked out.

18:28.035 --> 18:30.188
You know how much
I bragged about you, man?

18:30.252 --> 18:34.311
Like every fucking cat in D block knew about
you blowing up these al-Qaeda niggas, man.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.333
Everybody, dude.
You know what kind of street cred I got...

18:36.452 --> 18:38.705
for having a brother who knows
how to blow shit up?  Come on.

18:40.077 --> 18:43.001
- The world forgets fast, Frankie.
- So we'll make 'em remember.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.662
I got a solution.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.939
You got a solution.
Frankie, I've changed, all right?

18:51.035 --> 18:53.107
- Jimmy, I've changed.
- Yeah, you've changed.

18:53.201 --> 18:56.375
Yeah, I've done a lot of soul searching.
Really, I'm like--

18:56.868 --> 18:59.462
I'm like... I'm like Buddha and shit.

19:01.826 --> 19:05.785
Believe me,
I've had time to think.  Okay?

19:06.492 --> 19:08.712
A lot of suckers in there, man.
That ain't us.

19:09.117 --> 19:12.121
Okay?  I'm gonna make things right.
We just got a bad hand.

19:12.701 --> 19:14.328
Yeah, you think so?

19:16.367 --> 19:17.493
Jimmy...

19:19.200 --> 19:22.410
I know two guys, right?
They're good guys.

19:23.325 --> 19:25.102
They looked out for me in the joint.
They really did.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.918
Yeah, what about 'em?

19:28.408 --> 19:30.206
We all want the same things.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.248
To overcome the obstacles.

19:34.075 --> 19:36.293
Frankie, I'm not doing nothing shady.

19:37.991 --> 19:39.618
You call real estate shady?

19:40.658 --> 19:42.126
- Real estate?
- Yeah.

19:44.408 --> 19:47.482
What, you get yourself a fucking real
estate license when you were in the pen?

19:47.574 --> 19:50.077
I ain't trying to be a fucking agent, bro.

19:50.199 --> 19:52.443
I ain't a fucking agent. I'm a boss,
you know what I'm saying?

19:52.532 --> 19:56.536
A boss. Legit.  Calling the shots,
cashing the checks.

19:56.616 --> 19:59.244
- What, hollering, what?
- In that cheap suit?

19:59.741 --> 20:01.960
Fuck you, bro. Fuck you, man.

20:02.032 --> 20:03.750
Yeah, well, fuck you, bro.

20:04.782 --> 20:08.207
Come on, man. I want to look out for you.
Like the old days.

20:08.449 --> 20:10.621
Me and you against the world, remember?

20:11.323 --> 20:13.417
Let's go flip some houses, bro.

20:13.532 --> 20:15.660
I got the hook-up, man.
They're giving 'em away.

20:15.823 --> 20:19.623
- We fix and flip, fix and flip.  It's easy.
- Where you getting the cash from?

20:20.073 --> 20:22.246
Investor.
We got an investor.

20:23.573 --> 20:27.453
He's gonna take a big piece at first,
but it'll be all right.

20:28.948 --> 20:32.373
Come on. I want you to meet my boys.
They're outside.

20:34.489 --> 20:38.039
- What, now?
- Somebody had to give me a ride.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.074
You have some money on you?

20:43.489 --> 20:48.666
Oh, shit. Yo, this is my brother Jim--
I mean James.

20:49.155 --> 20:51.399
This is Ray.
This is Sugar.

20:51.489 --> 20:53.162
Hey, man.
How's it going?

20:54.072 --> 20:55.474
- Hey, man.
- How's it going, buddy?

20:55.572 --> 20:57.916
Sugar.
Sugar, Ray.

20:59.197 --> 21:00.494
Where's Leonard?

21:02.363 --> 21:04.161
That shit's funny, though.

21:04.238 --> 21:05.732
We heard a lot about you, man.

21:05.821 --> 21:08.826
So, like, James has some questions
about the investor...

21:08.988 --> 21:11.892
- how the deal's gonna go down, all that shit.
- As he should.

21:11.988 --> 21:16.414
I don't know if Frankie's told you, but
I don't have any cash or nothing like that.

21:16.529 --> 21:19.328
- Look, man, who does?
- No, we don't want your money, man.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.157
I'm putting together a team
of people that I can trust.

21:22.279 --> 21:25.658
We have a meeting tonight.
Give us a lift, I'll tell you more.

21:27.237 --> 21:29.035
- You want me to drive?
- Yeah.

21:29.529 --> 21:32.057
I thought you gave my bro a ride here.

21:32.154 --> 21:34.432
Oh, yeah, we drove.
We got a car, but it's small.

21:34.529 --> 21:36.907
I don't like small, man.
I don't like small at all.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.202
- Unless it's pussy, though.
- Unless it's pussy.

21:40.779 --> 21:42.746
Come on. Let's take a ride.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.492
All right, come on.
Hop in.

21:56.028 --> 21:57.996
So you did all the work
on this yourself, huh?

21:58.153 --> 22:01.077
Yeah. Yeah, I did all the body work
over the last couple months.

22:01.195 --> 22:04.779
- I just got her running a few weeks ago.
- Good with cars. It's good to know.

22:05.486 --> 22:08.160
- Yeah, I'm not bad.
- This kid's the best, man.

22:08.319 --> 22:10.788
He can fix 'em, he can build 'em,
he can race 'em.

22:11.069 --> 22:12.195
He's too humble.

22:13.111 --> 22:14.863
I also hear you did some time.

22:15.319 --> 22:17.321
Yeah, Frankie told you about that?

22:17.986 --> 22:20.865
- Yeah, Jimmy.
- Yeah, what can I say? I was stupid.

22:21.027 --> 22:23.951
Hey, happens to the best of us.

22:25.485 --> 22:27.079
Yeah, I guess so.

22:28.735 --> 22:30.408
Pull in right over there, Jimmy.

22:38.068 --> 22:41.151
- Who works this late?
- Who asks so many questions?

22:42.568 --> 22:44.662
Our investor owns the place.

22:45.151 --> 22:47.995
We won't be long. 20 minutes, tops.

22:49.443 --> 22:51.571
Hey, when we get back,

22:51.651 --> 22:53.278
your ass better be right here,
you hear me?

22:57.651 --> 23:00.951
- Frankie. Frankie.
- What? What?

23:01.067 --> 23:02.535
I got a bad feeling about this.

23:02.651 --> 23:05.404
Jimmy, come on, man,
the guy's got a red-eye to London.

23:05.526 --> 23:08.825
If we don't do it now, we lose
our shot.  It's good. It's good.

23:40.649 --> 23:43.118
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

24:20.815 --> 24:22.987
- Oh, shit. Get in the car.
- What the fuck?

24:23.106 --> 24:25.451
- Back in the fucking car!
- Get in the making car, come on.

24:27.314 --> 24:28.156
Go, go, go-

24:29.981 --> 24:32.279
When I say stay in the car,
you stay in the fucking car!

24:33.731 --> 24:35.929
- Drive!
- Oh, shit!

24:36.022 --> 24:36.944
Go!

25:37.437 --> 25:39.788
<i>You blew the fucking guy
away for no reason, man.</i>

25:39.789 --> 25:40.589
<i>What the fuck?</i>

25:40.590 --> 25:41.484
Relax.
Relax, man.

25:41.645 --> 25:44.444
- You shot that motherfucker for nothing.
- Shut the fuck up!

25:44.978 --> 25:47.902
- This is fucked, bro.
- Be more like your brother, Frankie.

25:50.395 --> 25:53.728
- Cool.
- Cool. All right. We're fucking cool, man.

25:55.061 --> 25:56.563
You're complicit in this.

25:57.769 --> 25:58.941
Welcome to the family.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.279
Get rid of this car.

26:06.311 --> 26:08.369
I don't think there's any way
he saw my plate.

26:08.370 --> 26:09.412
Just get rid of it!

26:09.811 --> 26:10.812
Fuck!

26:11.144 --> 26:12.987
You understand me, Jimmy?

26:15.310 --> 26:18.029
Look at me.
You understand me?

26:19.977 --> 26:21.696
Yeah, we're good.

26:24.602 --> 26:26.354
You kept your head.

26:27.018 --> 26:28.691
Usually do.

26:33.976 --> 26:36.071
Don't worry about the car, Jimmy.

26:36.518 --> 26:38.737
You can always jack another one.

26:41.310 --> 26:42.606
I'm sorry.

27:15.517 --> 27:17.860
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

27:20.058 --> 27:21.150
Fuck!

27:24.850 --> 27:25.896
Fuck!

27:33.141 --> 27:34.563
Yo, Jimmy,

27:38.724 --> 27:40.601
Yo, Jimmy, come on.

27:43.099 --> 27:46.399
- Fuck, Jimmy.
- Real estate, huh, motherfucker?

27:46.599 --> 27:49.319
Yo, yo, man. Watch the
suit, man. Come on.

27:50.557 --> 27:52.184
You didn't get rid of the fucking
car, man.  That's a problem.

27:52.265 --> 27:55.894
How could you do this to me, Frankie?
I'm your fucking brother, man!

27:56.015 --> 27:58.768
What?  It's not my fault, man.
It's not my fault.

27:58.890 --> 28:01.894
You know I'm fucking this close
to putting it all behind me.

28:02.015 --> 28:04.689
I'm fucking this close.
You're fucking screwing me again!

28:04.807 --> 28:07.104
I didn't know they were
gonna do that shit. Come on.

28:07.181 --> 28:09.400
The second I saw those two,
I knew they were trouble.

28:09.515 --> 28:11.017
What the tuck's the matter with you?

28:11.098 --> 28:13.626
- Open your fucking eyes!
- I talked to them.

28:13.723 --> 28:16.806
- There's not gonna be any more problems.
- Oh, yeah? No more problems?

28:16.931 --> 28:18.774
You're so fucking casual
about everything.

28:19.223 --> 28:21.942
No, seriously.  You got
a fucking screw loose, man!

28:22.014 --> 28:23.061
All right?

28:24.597 --> 28:26.474
You're fucked, all right?

28:26.889 --> 28:29.142
Jimmy, man. Come on, you can't go
anywhere right now.

28:29.222 --> 28:29.848
Where you going?

28:29.972 --> 28:32.020
- Yeah, no more problems?
- Come on, you can't leave.

28:32.097 --> 28:34.520
Yeah, no more problems?
Fuck you, Frankie.

28:34.639 --> 28:37.107
Yo, for real, man.
You can't do this.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.354
- You can't do it.
- You're my brother, all right?

28:41.639 --> 28:43.481
- You're supposed to look out for me.
- I am, I am.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.770
You are? Fuck you.

28:45.930 --> 28:49.980
- No, Jimmy, man.  Really, you can't.
- No?  Watch me.

28:50.138 --> 28:52.812
- 'Cause I'm leaving.
- No, Jimmy. Jimmy, really.

28:52.971 --> 28:54.143
For real.  Jimmy.

28:55.763 --> 28:57.857
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
They can't know you're running.

28:57.971 --> 29:00.191
They can't think you're gonna run on 'em.
Gimme that shit. Come on.

29:01.346 --> 29:03.065
Hey, what up?
What up?

29:03.263 --> 29:04.479
Taking a trip?

29:06.471 --> 29:10.226
Oh, no, James loaned me some
shit 'cause I ain't got no shit.

29:12.004 --> 29:13.305
You know, to where?

29:14.887 --> 29:16.514
Aren't you supposed to get rid of that?

29:18.054 --> 29:19.977
I was just about to do that.

29:21.137 --> 29:22.480
Hey, Jimmy, why don't
you hand Sugar your keys.

29:22.595 --> 29:23.972
He'll take care of it for you.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.225
Yeah, you do that.

29:27.012 --> 29:29.140
Come on, man.  You heard
him, give me the keys.

29:32.012 --> 29:33.604
Fucking amateurs.

29:34.012 --> 29:36.981
Sorry, Jimmy. It's a nice car.
I'm sorry.

29:39.386 --> 29:41.684
You know,
I'm having the conversation.

29:43.261 --> 29:44.763
Want to take this inside?

29:45.303 --> 29:47.101
No, I'm good here.

29:48.761 --> 29:50.308
It's your house.

29:54.511 --> 29:56.730
Frankie says you need money.

29:58.136 --> 30:01.936
- Oh, yeah? Did he say that?
- You need money, right?

30:05.427 --> 30:09.057
Tell him about the bank. Come on,
tell him about the bank.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.520
What bank?

30:15.719 --> 30:20.304
Yo, I'm not robbing no banks
with you guys, all right?

30:20.552 --> 30:21.973
Not happening.

30:24.552 --> 30:27.145
Take a look around, kid.
What do you see?

30:28.093 --> 30:30.062
Homes being foreclosed.

30:30.551 --> 30:33.430
People working two, three jobs just
to put food on the table...

30:33.551 --> 30:35.349
and still drowning in debt.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.436
Don't get me wrong.

30:38.634 --> 30:42.059
This country was founded
on great ideals and principles.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.803
But they've all been ruined...

30:46.051 --> 30:47.678
by the banks.

30:48.676 --> 30:51.019
Open your eyes, Jimmy.
It's the banks that are robbing you.

30:51.176 --> 30:53.053
Word the fuck up, man!

30:56.717 --> 30:59.391
- You know who my favorite president was?
- Who?

31:00.217 --> 31:01.719
Thomas Jefferson.

31:02.967 --> 31:06.141
Because he saw all
of this coming and tried to stop it.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.094
He fought the banks.

31:09.508 --> 31:11.806
JFK, too, and they killed him for it.

31:11.883 --> 31:14.102
Fucked up, man. Fucked up.

31:15.008 --> 31:19.012
The banking institution is more
dangerous than an army, he said.

31:21.883 --> 31:25.091
He also said that every
generation needs a revolution, Jimmy.

31:28.508 --> 31:31.101
The American Dream is just that...

31:32.091 --> 31:34.844
just a fucking dream.

31:35.091 --> 31:38.174
Deep. Shit, that's deep.

31:39.216 --> 31:41.719
Frankie, go start the car
and tum on the AC.

31:43.215 --> 31:45.092
It's too hot in this city.

31:47.007 --> 31:48.680
It's nice out, bro.

31:54.965 --> 31:59.926
Jimmy, man. Come on.
I'll be in touch.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.933
Get some sleep, Jimmy.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.308
But no sleepwalking.

32:09.964 --> 32:13.389
Any problems you cause
will he very bad for your brother.

32:43.047 --> 32:45.014
Aw, Frankie.

32:47.630 --> 32:50.679
You fucking motherfucker.

32:52.463 --> 32:53.965
You fucker.

33:04.621 --> 33:06.012
You motherfucker.

33:40.295 --> 33:42.717
Jimmy. Ah, Jimmy.

33:43.169 --> 33:45.171
Come on, you done calling dinosaurs?

33:46.919 --> 33:48.592
That's disgusting, man.

33:59.127 --> 34:00.870
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.462
Sug.
What's up, Sug?

34:07.419 --> 34:10.502
Oh, shit, look. They got all
this whip cream and shit.

34:10.710 --> 34:12.337
Yo, House. Come here, man.

34:13.043 --> 34:15.922
This is my brother, James.
He's driving and blowing shit up.

34:16.043 --> 34:17.260
Don't fuck this up.

34:19.085 --> 34:20.837
- You need to eat something, dude.
- What?

34:20.960 --> 34:22.052
Nothing. Nothing.

34:22.418 --> 34:24.545
That's like House's crew.
He's cool, he's cool.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.964
I don't talk to them too much.
Yeah, they're cool.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.962
- Fellas, what's up?
- Oh, shit. You remember Spoonie?

34:32.668 --> 34:34.010
- From back in the day.
- We used to play ball together, man.

34:34.083 --> 34:36.632
- Yo, Spoonie, from the Bywater..
- Boys, gather 'round.

34:37.417 --> 34:39.215
What's up, man?
What's up?

34:42.042 --> 34:46.002
War is a continuation of politics,
only by other means.

34:47.083 --> 34:49.757
Politics is a continuation
of economics by other means.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.092
This is our bank.

34:56.292 --> 34:58.465
This is our war.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.377
And this is our plan of attack.

35:02.958 --> 35:05.211
We need to create a staged distraction.

35:05.833 --> 35:08.178
James will jack four cars
and blow 'em up all over

35:08.250 --> 35:11.093
Central Business
District to draw out the cops.

35:29.332 --> 35:30.504
As we enter,

35:30.707 --> 35:33.130
Frankie will secure the guard
and disable the cameras.

35:33.207 --> 35:35.756
Spoon will take out the hostages.

35:36.540 --> 35:39.464
Sugar and I will grab the manager
and go for the vault.

35:40.332 --> 35:44.462
Our window of opportunity is five minutes
after the vault unlocks automatically...

35:44.523 --> 35:47.093
according to our source
back at the warehouse.

35:47.957 --> 35:49.459
No risk he'll squeal.

35:52.456 --> 35:55.666
Nevertheless, James will be
on police scanner in the van.

35:56.081 --> 35:58.709
And, James, we'll need a
nondescript getaway van.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.042
Weapons and ammo on you, House.

36:04.331 --> 36:05.503
We all clear?

36:15.539 --> 36:17.382
Yo, it's a good plan, man.

36:17.539 --> 36:19.962
- It's a fucking stupid plan.
- Jimmy, come on, man.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.425
We each break out with like
half a mil, man, come on.

36:22.997 --> 36:25.091
Jimmy, I need this.
We both need this.

36:25.622 --> 36:28.704
We get our life back on track.
Erase all those lost years.

36:28.772 --> 36:31.045
I was on track, Frankie.
All right, now get lost.

36:31.622 --> 36:33.615
Jimmy, come on, man.
Don't do this.  Don't do this!

36:33.705 --> 36:35.707
- Frankie, get the fuck out of my way.
- We need this, man. You can't walk.

36:35.872 --> 36:39.001
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Come on, man. Jimmy, please.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.378
Look, you know what?
If you're gonna rob a bank, Frankie...

36:41.538 --> 36:44.963
You fucking go in, you empty the tills,
then you run out, you fucking drive like fuck.

36:45.413 --> 36:49.043
Nobody actually goes for the vault.
That's just in the fucking movies, bro.

36:49.996 --> 36:54.375
Yeah, but we got the codes, bro.
We got the schedule to the time release.

36:54.496 --> 36:57.625
- That's fucking huge.
- They fucking killed a guy for it!

36:58.371 --> 37:02.246
- What the fuck doesn't register with you?
- I know that's bad, man. That's fucking bad.

37:02.337 --> 37:03.914
- It is fucking bad!
- Yeah, but what can I do?

37:04.012 --> 37:05.835
What can I do about it now, man?

37:06.496 --> 37:08.964
They'll fucking kill you, bro.
They'll fucking kill you.

37:09.037 --> 37:11.039
They'll kill me, man.
They'll even kill Emily.

37:14.495 --> 37:17.044
How the fuck do they
even know about Emily?

37:17.620 --> 37:18.542
What?

37:19.745 --> 37:22.953
Yo, how the fuck do they
even know about Emily, huh?

37:23.078 --> 37:25.456
- I don't know.
- Do they even fucking know about her?

37:25.911 --> 37:28.585
- I may have said something about you guys.
- What the fuck did you say?

37:29.370 --> 37:31.763
When I was in the joint,
I may have talked about you and Emily.

37:31.778 --> 37:34.001
- Why the fuck are you talking about us?
- I was so happy for you.

37:34.245 --> 37:37.249
Man, there's no love in there.
I was happy for you guys. I'm sorry.

37:38.078 --> 37:40.456
- Fuck!
- Look, man, there's no way out, man.

37:40.953 --> 37:44.858
This guy, Ray, he's like fucking...
he's like fucking Manson.

37:44.952 --> 37:47.125
Why the fuck do you
buy into his shit, huh?

37:48.619 --> 37:51.998
You don't know what it's like
being in there with the lifers. I fucking--

37:52.452 --> 37:55.786
It's brutal, man.
These guys... he saved me. I owe him.

37:55.952 --> 37:56.853
Yeah, you owe him?

37:56.952 --> 37:59.172
Yeah, so what?
You just gonna be his little bitch now?

38:00.369 --> 38:02.612
- What did you say?
- You gonna be his fucking little bitch now?

38:02.702 --> 38:05.751
- Don't you fucking talking.
- Just a fucking little clown!

38:05.827 --> 38:08.080
- Don't you fucking say that to me!
- A little fucking juggling clown.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.945
You don't know what
I've making been through!

38:10.035 --> 38:11.628
You don't know what I've been through!

38:11.702 --> 38:12.981
- You don't know!
- No, I don't!

38:12.982 --> 38:14.838
You don't fucking know,
man.  They fucked me...

38:16.660 --> 38:20.790
Fucking took my swagger, Jimmy!
They took my swagger!

38:21.993 --> 38:26.122
Fucking robbed me from me, man.
They making broke me, bro.

38:26.243 --> 38:29.451
You don't know shit.
You don't know what I've been through.

38:29.534 --> 38:31.707
You don't know what
I've fucking lived through.

38:31.784 --> 38:33.286
These motherfuckers...

38:34.742 --> 38:38.576
What happened, bro?
Tell me what happened.

38:39.201 --> 38:45.038
What the fuck happened to you?
I want my fucking bro back, all right?

38:47.992 --> 38:50.040
They fucked me, man.

38:54.325 --> 38:57.579
They're fucked, Jimmy.
You don't know shit, man.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.623
You don't know fucking shit, man!

39:00.825 --> 39:04.125
They fucked me in the ass
with toothpaste, man!

39:04.908 --> 39:09.038
They fucked me in the ass with toothpaste!
Bro, you don't know fucking shit!

39:09.783 --> 39:12.311
- All right? They fucked me.
- They what?

39:12.408 --> 39:14.035
This guy fucking saved me!

39:15.449 --> 39:18.703
These guys fucking saved me.
I'm fucking be done, bro.

39:19.366 --> 39:22.666
I swear to God, man.
I swear to God, listen to me.

39:22.866 --> 39:26.699
They know we're only in it for a one
time deal.  They're cool with that. Okay?

39:26.782 --> 39:30.366
Tuesday night, we bounce.
Okay?

39:31.032 --> 39:33.080
We good, man. I promise you, Jimmy.
I promise you.

39:33.199 --> 39:35.265
We don't have to do
anything like this again.

39:35.366 --> 39:37.035
You won't have to
do anything like this.

39:37.070 --> 39:40.408
Man, we don't have we're gonna...
We don't have to be like Mom!

39:41.032 --> 39:43.079
We can have fucking options.

39:43.740 --> 39:45.617
We can have fucking options!

39:47.115 --> 39:49.333
I'm gonna get you your own shop!

39:50.073 --> 39:52.075
You won't have to see me anymore.

39:54.531 --> 39:56.249
You don't have to see me.

39:59.406 --> 40:03.912
You just gotta trust me, Jimmy.
You gotta trust me, man.

40:10.031 --> 40:11.953
It's not so easy, bro.

40:12.864 --> 40:15.117
It's not so easy, Frankie.

40:19.989 --> 40:22.332
Hey, I know it's stressful.

40:26.697 --> 40:29.041
But what in life isn't?

40:45.763 --> 40:47.991
Thought you could use a cold drink.

40:49.154 --> 40:50.827
Hey, thanks.

41:07.054 --> 41:08.951
I think it's gonna rain all week.

41:09.945 --> 41:12.894
Hey, would you mind?
There's a ratchet over there on the table.

41:12.987 --> 41:14.954
- Could you pass it to me?
- Ratchet?

41:15.112 --> 41:17.705
Yeah, it might be in
the toolbox, actually.

41:20.611 --> 41:22.705
I don't know what a ratchet looks like.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.745
You know what actually?

41:30.819 --> 41:33.117
You wanna come over here
for a second and give me a hand?

41:33.194 --> 41:37.154
- Yeah, what do you need?
- If you could hold that right there.

41:37.861 --> 41:40.204
- Okay.
- And just keep that good and tight.

41:40.277 --> 41:42.496
- Here?
- Yeah. You got it?

41:43.111 --> 41:44.532
Yeah, got it.

41:45.277 --> 41:46.950
- Yeah, just like that.
- Okay.

42:05.443 --> 42:09.152
Right in here.
I'm gonna tighten this up.

42:12.818 --> 42:15.267
- And there she goes.
- Got it?

42:15.359 --> 42:18.489
- I got it. All right, thanks.
- You're welcome.

42:33.026 --> 42:35.073
Even the rain's hot tonight.

43:32.148 --> 43:35.823
I've heard some crazy stories
about you while you were away.

43:38.107 --> 43:39.984
Oh, yeah?
Like what?

43:41.065 --> 43:43.318
We went to school
with some bitter people.

43:47.231 --> 43:50.155
You mean stories like
I went to prison after Iraq?

43:52.273 --> 43:53.399
Yeah.

44:01.772 --> 44:03.365
So...

44:04.897 --> 44:06.023
So?

44:07.355 --> 44:09.449
They said the same thing about Frankie.

44:12.439 --> 44:14.817
Yeah, well, don't listen to 'em.

44:16.522 --> 44:18.650
Who should I listen to?

44:24.772 --> 44:26.865
Look, Frankie and I went traveling.

44:27.521 --> 44:29.398
He stayed on,
I came home.

44:30.021 --> 44:31.864
That's it, end of story.

44:39.729 --> 44:40.946
Okay.

44:48.854 --> 44:50.652
So, what happened to your car?

44:52.271 --> 44:55.775
I had to lend it to my brother.

44:56.062 --> 44:57.781
Frankie's back in town.

44:58.187 --> 45:01.066
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

45:02.937 --> 45:05.190
Driving a car without a key.

45:11.312 --> 45:15.146
You see, I went down to my work
this morning to grab a loner and...

45:16.145 --> 45:19.194
no one was around
and I couldn't find the keys and...

45:22.478 --> 45:26.061
- I know, it looks a little bit shady.
- No, not at all.

45:27.894 --> 45:29.237
I don't want to know.

46:12.268 --> 46:15.647
Units, dispatch is available.
Do I come across clear?

46:28.059 --> 46:31.108
Come here. Come on,
come on. Come on, come on.

46:37.350 --> 46:40.650
- What are you doing, Frankie? I'm working.
- I know. I know, hey.

46:41.475 --> 46:44.319
- I know what you're thinking.
- What are you doing with a fucking yellow--

46:44.392 --> 46:48.977
Know why? 'Cause who would think
I stole a fucking yellow car?

46:49.316 --> 46:51.120
- Who would steal a yellow car?
- Who would steal a yellow car?

46:51.155 --> 46:53.944
Exactly.
Nobody. I'm smart.

46:54.058 --> 46:58.939
And, if you're getting pussy and you
drive this car, you know she loves you.

46:59.683 --> 47:01.936
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Frankie, I'm working, I can't.

47:02.724 --> 47:05.523
Gotta make time, let's go.
Trust me, we gotta go.

47:07.099 --> 47:08.726
All right, one second.

47:12.182 --> 47:14.527
Hey, Burnell, cover for me.
I'll be one second.

47:14.599 --> 47:15.976
Yeah, all right.

47:18.099 --> 47:20.192
I mean, really, who steals a yellow car?

47:21.890 --> 47:23.608
It goes with my green jacket.

47:24.515 --> 47:25.732
And the brown.

47:27.140 --> 47:29.643
Oh, so when I stole it,
I fucked the door up.

47:29.723 --> 47:32.693
I'm like driving around having
to fucking hold the door.

47:32.973 --> 47:36.180
It's a clown car, man.
This is embarrassing.

47:36.181 --> 47:39.856
Let's just pull around the corner, we'll
jack something that's not yellow, okay?

47:40.181 --> 47:41.775
It's called fly yellow.

48:04.014 --> 48:06.392
I think the suspension
on this car's fucked.

48:07.889 --> 48:11.062
Fuck, man. Everybody can't
be as good as you, bro.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.021
Everybody can't take the fucking
hot rods all the fucking time.

48:14.097 --> 48:16.690
It's easy for me to pop this shit.
Come on.

48:18.305 --> 48:19.477
All right.

48:47.429 --> 48:48.555
What's up?

48:53.095 --> 48:54.597
Damn, whose funeral?

48:55.387 --> 48:57.685
- Yours.
- Yo, what the fuck's your problem, man?

48:58.970 --> 49:00.722
- You all right, Frankie?
- Yo, yo, Ray, man.

49:00.803 --> 49:02.647
Shut the fuck up, Frankie.

49:02.970 --> 49:06.428
- Like Montezuma's revenge of the mouth.
- What? I didn't say shit, man!

49:06.553 --> 49:09.148
- Why you hitting me, man?
- Yeah, man.  What the fuck?

49:09.261 --> 49:11.104
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

49:11.220 --> 49:13.213
What the fuck was you doing
at the police station this morning?

49:13.303 --> 49:15.022
Yo, chill, man. Come on, man.

49:15.511 --> 49:17.605
You think I don't know
about your little girlfriend?

49:18.011 --> 49:19.934
You think she can't
be taken away from your life

49:20.094 --> 49:22.347
just as quickly as
she was brought back into it?

49:23.136 --> 49:25.138
So let's try this one more time.

49:25.969 --> 49:28.998
Hold up, man!  I was dropping
her of! For work, that's it.

49:29.094 --> 49:32.551
All right? I haven't said jack shit.
She doesn't know nothing. I swear to God.

49:32.552 --> 49:34.930
- At the police station?
- Yeah, she just works there, that's it.

49:36.802 --> 49:38.646
- She a cop, Frank?
- Oh, man. Nah, man, come on.

49:38.760 --> 49:40.262
- She's not a cop.
- Yo, I didn't know that.

49:40.344 --> 49:41.686
She's not a cop.

49:42.177 --> 49:43.429
Is she a cop?

49:43.968 --> 49:44.890
Please listen to me.

49:44.968 --> 49:47.346
I promise you, she's not
a fucking cop, all right?

49:47.510 --> 49:51.415
The fuck, man?
She ain't a cop. We cool, right?

49:51.510 --> 49:54.353
- Jimmy, tell 'em.
- I promise you she's not a fucking cop.

49:54.468 --> 49:57.096
Chill, man.
She ain't a cop. Fuck.

49:58.343 --> 50:00.471
Fucking my hair all up and shit.

50:02.159 --> 50:04.352
- You all right?
- Don't shoot my dick, man.

50:04.468 --> 50:06.616
- You be alright, man, relax.
- Don't point that shit at my dick.

50:06.709 --> 50:08.011
Come on, let's go.

50:08.843 --> 50:11.346
- Come on, Jimmy.
- What the fuck, Frankie?

50:28.925 --> 50:31.020
Hey, remember...

50:31.383 --> 50:35.014
remember when you almost blew
your hand off that Fourth of July...

50:35.383 --> 50:37.681
with that homemade
blockbuster you made?

50:38.675 --> 50:42.100
Shit, Jimmy.
That was crazy.

50:43.716 --> 50:46.060
Every car alarm
in the neighborhood went off.

50:46.633 --> 50:48.055
And you were just looking at me, right?

50:48.216 --> 50:49.968
I remember you had
this look in your eye like...

50:50.924 --> 50:52.142
you're like

50:54.383 --> 50:56.976
like you discovered pussy or something.

51:01.882 --> 51:04.226
I couldn't hear shit for a week.

51:06.341 --> 51:09.765
You're the one that put the sugar
in her gas tank, aren't you?

51:17.048 --> 51:18.925
That was you.

51:19.632 --> 51:20.486
Jimmy, come on.

51:20.487 --> 51:23.045
You tried to set us up
so that I couldn't run.

51:24.757 --> 51:25.883
Jimmy.

51:29.756 --> 51:32.305
- That was you.
- Come on, Jimmy. I wouldn't do that.

51:32.423 --> 51:33.925
I swear, Jimmy.

51:34.340 --> 51:38.264
I didn't know they were gonna do that.
I didn't know, man.

51:39.506 --> 51:42.055
I know, it's not nice.
I know.

51:42.548 --> 51:43.825
But it's smart though, right?

51:43.922 --> 51:48.348
They needed someone close to you
to get to that you cared about, right? So...

51:51.047 --> 51:55.848
Anyway, look, hey,
it's a good thing, no?

51:57.880 --> 52:01.054
I like that girl.
Nothing's gonna happen.

52:03.630 --> 52:05.928
Some fucking brother I got.

52:08.213 --> 52:12.046
You're a fucking piece of work, Frankie.
You know that?

52:16.046 --> 52:17.515
I'm done eating.

52:20.088 --> 52:21.089
I'm done.

52:28.129 --> 52:30.223
You remember when Dad went away?

52:33.629 --> 52:35.848
Do you? You were young.

52:40.295 --> 52:43.015
Do you remember how Mom fell apart?

52:43.612 --> 52:47.841
- What the fuck?
- We had nothing!

52:48.962 --> 52:50.760
No one to come to!

52:55.337 --> 52:57.509
I remember that shit.

53:00.628 --> 53:03.431
I remember I came home,
I found you locked out of the house...

53:03.553 --> 53:06.006
'cause Mom had a fucking nigger over.

53:11.253 --> 53:13.346
And you were filthy.

53:16.253 --> 53:19.552
And I cleaned you up.
I fed you.

53:22.877 --> 53:25.926
I stole everything for us, Jimmy.

53:29.127 --> 53:32.381
Everything, man.
I stole everything for us.

53:33.544 --> 53:36.627
All your gear,
your first set of tools.

53:39.002 --> 53:42.961
Yeah, I made mistakes,
I'm a piece of shit.

53:43.377 --> 53:45.880
What can I say?
I'm human.

53:46.585 --> 53:49.088
But I always looked out
for my little brother...

53:49.335 --> 53:51.678
to the best of my abilities...

53:52.043 --> 53:55.172
even if they were somewhat impaired.

53:59.584 --> 54:02.428
It was always me
and you against the world.

54:07.667 --> 54:09.261
Me and you...

54:10.584 --> 54:12.382
against the world.

54:14.459 --> 54:16.086
Me and you, Frankie.

54:18.417 --> 54:20.090
It was me and you.

54:35.458 --> 54:37.927
I'm gonna go take a piss.

54:40.833 --> 54:42.425
Yo, Frankie.

54:44.958 --> 54:46.005
Yeah?

54:48.624 --> 54:51.377
You ever wonder what life
would be like if...

54:52.749 --> 54:55.628
if you never pulled the trigger
on that cop 10 years ago?

55:02.040 --> 55:03.917
But I did, Jimmy.

55:05.957 --> 55:07.004
But I did.

55:41.622 --> 55:44.091
Hey, I was just thinking about you.

55:44.206 --> 55:49.006
I think we should check out
this new place in the Bywater.

55:49.122 --> 55:51.591
I was just reading about it.
What do you think?

55:54.955 --> 55:56.423
Something's wrong.

56:03.392 --> 56:07.226
I just wanted to let you know
that your car is good to go.

56:13.684 --> 56:15.975
Okay come on, what's wrong?

56:18.809 --> 56:22.633
Look... this last week.

56:25.142 --> 56:28.142
You know, the time
that we've had...

56:30.975 --> 56:33.016
it's been a mistake.

56:44.058 --> 56:46.474
Yeah, of course, I was...

56:49.807 --> 56:51.830
No, you are absolutely right.

56:51.831 --> 56:54.933
It's stupid trying to recreate something
that never existed to begin with.

56:54.934 --> 56:55.634
Because it didn't.  It...

56:55.724 --> 56:58.323
- I'm agreeing with you.
- Emily, I...

56:58.324 --> 57:00.742
- How much do I owe you?
- Emily, listen to me...

57:00.777 --> 57:04.074
No, no, no. This is about business. This
is about you fixing my car.  So let me...

57:04.199 --> 57:06.890
Look, I don't want your
fucking money, alright?

57:09.223 --> 57:11.223
I'm sorry, it's just...

57:12.473 --> 57:14.606
- I care about you and I...

57:14.607 --> 57:16.918
- I can't explain things the way that makes sense.
-Obviously not.

57:16.953 --> 57:19.804
You can't.  I understand
perfectly.  Thank you.

57:20.005 --> 57:21.735
I'm leaving town.

57:23.598 --> 57:25.473
When?

57:29.806 --> 57:34.097
- Tomorrow.
-  You and your brother traveling again?

57:46.305 --> 57:50.489
- Well don't.  I don't.
- Okay so look, I'll put my name here.

57:50.514 --> 57:55.138
You gotta understand that
if things were different that...

57:55.263 --> 57:58.638
If I could just explain things to
you, I wish I can make things...

57:58.663 --> 58:03.255
Okay, I don't want to do this.
Okay, please.  Spare me.

58:05.221 --> 58:06.763
Go, James.

58:08.971 --> 58:12.988
Look I just... I care
about you, you know?

58:13.113 --> 58:16.346
I get that.
You still go.

58:18.171 --> 58:22.179
Right. So go.
Go!

58:22.304 --> 58:24.596
Alright.  Alright.
I'll leave you alone.

59:28.343 --> 59:31.052
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:58.382
- Yo, I'm going to light you up.
- You missed. You missed.

01:01:00.632 --> 01:01:02.590
Ain't missing with this, bitch.

01:01:14.673 --> 01:01:19.798
- Emily, I'm going for coffee? You want one?
- No, I'm already on my second.

01:01:21.256 --> 01:01:24.756
<i>An explosion in Greenpoint.
Send reinforcements.</i>

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:29.297
- Unit 31, could you please repeat?
- We got explosion at Greenpoint.

01:02:03.644 --> 01:02:05.473
I need units to respond to alarms at

01:02:05.494 --> 01:02:08.744
St. Charles and Jackson and in the Quarter
at Ursulines and Chartres.

01:02:08.773 --> 01:02:11.833
<i>We have an MVA with a tour bus</i>

01:02:11.868 --> 01:02:13.703
I'm sorry, unit 61, could
you please repeat?

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:16.403
Did you say, a tour bus and
three chained vehicles?

01:02:42.691 --> 01:02:46.241
Copy that.  Another explosion
reported by city parks.  A car bomb.

01:02:46.899 --> 01:02:49.152
Looks like it's gonna
be a busy morning.

01:03:00.023 --> 01:03:02.025
Looks like it's gonna rain.

01:03:58.938 --> 01:04:00.485
Nobody fucking move!

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.177
Nobody fucking move. Or
I'll show you your fucking insides.

01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:06.400
- Come on, get down!
- Down, motherfucker! Down!

01:04:06.488 --> 01:04:07.984
No phone calls, bitch!

01:04:08.771 --> 01:04:10.115
You! Down! Down!

01:04:10.229 --> 01:04:12.527
Hands, ladies!
Show us your fucking hands?

01:04:12.604 --> 01:04:14.982
- Against the fucking wall!
- Let's go, ladies. Out the back.

01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:16.614
Get the fuck down!

01:04:17.021 --> 01:04:19.469
- Let's go! Move it, move it, move it!
- Give me your cell phones!

01:04:19.562 --> 01:04:22.894
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Quick, quick, quick, quick.

01:04:22.895 --> 01:04:27.106
- Everybody listen up!
- Take a deep breath and relax!

01:04:27.187 --> 01:04:30.441
We're here to rob the bank, not you.

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:34.829
In the five minutes we spend here, the
CEO of this bank will make more money...

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:37.781
off of all of you than we take from him.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.570
Banks have become an invisible
threat to our democracy.

01:04:41.936 --> 01:04:43.313
<i>So consider this...</i>

01:04:46.103 --> 01:04:49.186
justice.
Don't be a hero!

01:04:49.436 --> 01:04:52.986
Don't.  Look away.
Look away!

01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:01.277
- The vault, now!
- Get the fuck up! Now!

01:05:01.352 --> 01:05:03.980
- I can't open the vault.
- Man, get outta here. Let's go.

01:05:04.061 --> 01:05:06.859
Get down, get down. Get down,
motherfucker, get down!

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:15.062
Move your fat fucking ass! Go!

01:05:16.852 --> 01:05:19.070
Open that gate.
Get it open!

01:05:19.227 --> 01:05:21.755
Look, it's not gonna work.
Even if I give you the code...

01:05:21.852 --> 01:05:23.354
this thing only opens
at predetermined times.

01:05:23.477 --> 01:05:26.070
- Just enter the fucking code.
- It's not gonna work!

01:05:27.435 --> 01:05:30.735
I'll only say it one more time.
Enter the code.

01:05:36.351 --> 01:05:37.898
Fuck you.

01:05:55.642 --> 01:05:58.065
Thanks a lot, man.
You've been a lot of help.

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:06.646
Nice.

01:06:08.142 --> 01:06:09.018
<i>Bags.</i>

01:07:21.306 --> 01:07:24.480
Oh, shit! Fuck, man.
I think somebody saw me!

01:07:24.556 --> 01:07:26.058
Fuck! Shit!

01:07:26.181 --> 01:07:28.299
What a fucking dumb ass!
Let's get the truck outta here!

01:07:28.389 --> 01:07:29.641
What the fuck you looking at?

01:07:29.764 --> 01:07:32.187
Just stop fucking twitching or I'm gonna
blow your-fucking head off. Look down!

01:07:32.347 --> 01:07:35.191
- Yo, she's probably calling the fucking cops.
- Get your shit together!

01:07:35.264 --> 01:07:38.468
- What are we gonna do? We gotta go!
- Calm down. What the fuck time is it?

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:40.813
- Shit.  How many minutes ago.
- About 2 minutes.

01:07:40.814 --> 01:07:42.048
- Where the fuck you going?
- Two fucking minutes!

01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:43.634
Then we'd be out of here, my man.
- Where the fuck you going, man?

01:07:43.672 --> 01:07:44.598
Fuck!

01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:47.089
Okay, and how many did you see?

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.478
<i>There was one inside
the bank and he had a mask,</i>

01:07:49.555 --> 01:07:51.228
<i>and I think he had a gun, too.</i>

01:07:51.305 --> 01:07:54.250
David-four, possible
armed robbery in progress.

01:07:54.254 --> 01:07:57.228
4140 Canal Street, Mid-City.
Do you copy?

01:07:57.554 --> 01:07:59.397
<i>Roger, that.
We'll check it out.</i>

01:08:06.929 --> 01:08:08.831
Hey, yo, time's up, man.
We gotta go.

01:08:08.929 --> 01:08:11.958
We got 30 seconds, come on!
Help him. Hold his bag!

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:14.455
- Grab his bag, come on.
- Hurry up, though. Hurry up, come on.

01:08:14.512 --> 01:08:17.506
We gotta go, come on!
Man, that's a lot of fucking dough.

01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:18.687
Yeah, baby!

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.459
Yo, cops are coming, man.
We gotta go!

01:08:30.553 --> 01:08:32.725
Ah, man, this is not good.
Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:08:32.803 --> 01:08:33.770
Where is everybody?

01:08:33.928 --> 01:08:36.430
In the fucking vault!  They been there
forever!  Where the fuck you going?

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:38.856
Where you going?
Get back in the fucking van!

01:08:38.928 --> 01:08:41.772
- Get back in the fucking van!
- Calm the fuck down, all right?

01:08:43.761 --> 01:08:44.761
Fuck!

01:08:47.394 --> 01:08:49.846
It's fucking crazy.
Gonna start killing!

01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:53.430
That's good. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:56.430
- Come on, let's get the fuck outta here!
- Yeah, we gotta go!

01:08:56.551 --> 01:09:00.055
We gotta go now! Come on!
Yo, leave it!

01:09:02.385 --> 01:09:05.059
Yo, Spoonie.
Where the fuck is Spoonie?

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.932
Spoonie!

01:09:08.469 --> 01:09:10.812
Where the fuck is Spoonie, man?

01:09:10.885 --> 01:09:13.788
Oh, shit!  Five-O, five-O!
Get the fuck away from the windows!

01:09:13.885 --> 01:09:16.913
- Hey! What the fuck is that?
- That was just our fucking van!

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:20.059
- Yo, he's gone, bro!
- Jimmy!

01:10:01.675 --> 01:10:05.054
Confirmed armed robbery in progress
at the Canal Street Savings Bank.

01:10:05.216 --> 01:10:08.060
Shots have been fired.
All available units respond.

01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:11.013
Get the fuck down!

01:10:29.466 --> 01:10:32.800
Motherfucker!

01:10:47.007 --> 01:10:47.929
Fuck!

01:10:49.007 --> 01:10:50.008
You all right?

01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:55.972
Frankie!
Are you hit?

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:02.884
Oh, shit. Jimmy.

01:11:03.631 --> 01:11:04.849
Oh, shit!

01:11:11.797 --> 01:11:12.844
Oh, shit!

01:11:15.797 --> 01:11:16.923
Fuck!

01:11:17.506 --> 01:11:19.008
All right, listen up!

01:11:19.922 --> 01:11:22.425
We have to adapt
to a changing situation.

01:11:22.589 --> 01:11:24.591
- New game plan.
- Game plan?

01:11:24.689 --> 01:11:27.468
Spoonie ran off with his bitch-ass
with our motherfucking getaway truck!

01:11:27.672 --> 01:11:29.470
We still have the advantage, Sugar.

01:11:29.838 --> 01:11:33.844
These are first response city cops!
They have handguns and shotguns.

01:11:34.255 --> 01:11:36.508
We have machine guns
and the high ground.

01:11:36.588 --> 01:11:38.716
But we gotta move
before they improve their position.

01:11:38.838 --> 01:11:42.217
Ray, man, I'm fucking bleeding, man!
I'm fucking bleeding!

01:11:42.296 --> 01:11:44.424
There is no other option, Frankie!

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.614
Now listen to me.
We need another getaway car.

01:11:48.713 --> 01:11:51.466
That's our only way out of here.
James!

01:11:51.546 --> 01:11:54.754
You got to get to the side entrance
and jack us another car!

01:11:55.129 --> 01:11:57.599
- Hang in there, Frankie!
- Frankie, listen to me.

01:11:58.004 --> 01:12:00.507
- We're gonna get outta here.
- We need collateral!

01:12:00.629 --> 01:12:03.678
Sugar, cover me. Go!

01:12:06.212 --> 01:12:08.931
- What's your name? What's your name?
- Katie.

01:12:09.045 --> 01:12:11.164
All right, Katie.
You be cool, you live.

01:12:11.254 --> 01:12:13.097
You freak out on me, you die.

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:14.547
Got it? Let's go!

01:12:15.045 --> 01:12:16.262
Come on, James!

01:12:18.503 --> 01:12:20.222
Come on, James, now's our break!

01:12:20.462 --> 01:12:22.590
- Get up, man.
- Frankie, we're gonna get out of here.

01:12:22.712 --> 01:12:23.883
Go with Sugar, okay?

01:12:25.836 --> 01:12:28.885
Get up, man, we gotta go!
Gotta go, man!

01:12:56.794 --> 01:12:59.493
- Come on, Frankie, get up!
- I'm bleeding out, man.

01:12:59.585 --> 01:13:01.007
We gotta go, man!

01:13:03.335 --> 01:13:04.587
Fuck, dude.

01:13:25.251 --> 01:13:27.971
Get in the car!
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:13:29.376 --> 01:13:31.674
- Drive!
- Where's Frankie?

01:13:31.751 --> 01:13:32.843
- Go, go, go, go!
- Where the fuck's Frankie?

01:13:32.959 --> 01:13:36.543
Frankie's as good as dead, James.
Let's go! Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:52.841
What the fuck are you doing?
Go, go!

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.627
I'm not leaving without Frankie!

01:13:57.625 --> 01:14:00.003
- Come on! Go, move!
- Shit!

01:14:00.583 --> 01:14:01.960
I got you covered. Go!

01:14:27.915 --> 01:14:29.132
<i>Here's what we know so far.</i>

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:33.215
<i>Gunfire's been exchanged with at least
two suspects trying to escape the Bank.</i>

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:36.372
<i>Looks like some assailants
are still inside holding hostages.</i>

01:14:36.373 --> 01:14:38.877
<i>What we don't know is exactly how--</i>

01:14:53.748 --> 01:14:54.795
Frankie.

01:15:06.122 --> 01:15:07.749
I'm sorry.

01:15:15.997 --> 01:15:17.966
What the fuck are you doing?

01:15:19.455 --> 01:15:21.253
I'm bleeding out.

01:15:21.622 --> 01:15:22.874
I'm bleeding out.

01:15:29.205 --> 01:15:32.664
All right,
I'm gonna take a look, all right?

01:15:35.413 --> 01:15:36.460
Okay?

01:15:44.871 --> 01:15:45.667
Shit.

01:15:55.787 --> 01:15:57.915
All right, it's not that bad.

01:16:00.829 --> 01:16:02.957
We gotta stop this bleeding though.

01:16:13.287 --> 01:16:14.288
All right...

01:16:15.703 --> 01:16:18.502
Let's get you fixed up
and get the fuck out of here.

01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:20.667
All right?

01:16:25.995 --> 01:16:26.587
I'm gonna go get some supplies.

01:16:26.703 --> 01:16:29.172
I'll be right back.
We'll get you all fixed up, all right?

01:16:31.994 --> 01:16:33.996
All right, I'll book it.
Keep going!

01:16:34.161 --> 01:16:35.959
Go! Go!

01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:38.896
Sugar!

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.291
Motherfucker!

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.868
Yo! Hey, lady. Lady.
Come here, get up.

01:17:12.243 --> 01:17:14.245
All right, I'm trying to get up.

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:15.912
- Get up. Don't worry.
- Shit!

01:17:16.034 --> 01:17:18.457
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
hurt you, all right?  Come on.

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.502
Come on.
Come in here.

01:17:22.243 --> 01:17:23.915
Get the fuck back!

01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:26.161
Tell your guys to get the fuck back!

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:28.916
All right?
I got hostages in here!

01:17:28.992 --> 01:17:31.541
I'm gonna start throwing
bodies out the window!

01:17:32.367 --> 01:17:34.995
<i>We're standing down.
Stand down!</i>

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:39.452
This is Captain Sullivan speaking.
Is everybody all right in there?

01:17:39.534 --> 01:17:40.955
What do you think!

01:17:41.075 --> 01:17:44.079
Do you need anything?
Do you need medical assistance?

01:17:44.242 --> 01:17:48.042
No! Just get your fucking guys
the fuck away from this bank!

01:17:49.075 --> 01:17:51.453
I'm gonna start fucking
murdering people, all right?

01:17:51.575 --> 01:17:54.854
Okay, I'm here to help you.

01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:57.293
Son, you tell me what you want.

01:17:57.366 --> 01:18:01.749
I just want... you know what?  I
want to talk to a real fucking negotiator,

01:18:01.784 --> 01:18:03.871
all right, Captain Whatever
-the-fuck-your-name-is!

01:18:03.949 --> 01:18:06.953
Okay, son. He's been contacted.
He's en route.

01:18:07.074 --> 01:18:08.792
<i>Negotiator's on the way.</i>

01:18:09.158 --> 01:18:09.999
All right.

01:18:10.574 --> 01:18:13.327
Just stay the fuck off
from this fucking bank!

01:18:13.616 --> 01:18:14.868
Come on, ma'am.

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:17.993
All right, you did good.

01:18:18.116 --> 01:18:21.495
You did good.
Thank you very much. You did good.

01:18:21.699 --> 01:18:24.773
Yo, I need a first aid kit.
Where the fuck's the first aid kit here?

01:18:24.865 --> 01:18:27.914
Somebody, where the fuck
is the first aid kit in here?

01:18:34.615 --> 01:18:37.289
<i>Okay, Central,
I've got eyes on the suspect.</i>

01:18:37.407 --> 01:18:40.000
He's on foot heading
north on Royal Street.

01:19:01.656 --> 01:19:02.682
What the...?

01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:17.973
Ah, fuck!

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:21.039
Mother motherfucker!

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.862
- Okay, last one. All right.
- Holy...

01:19:24.863 --> 01:19:26.360
- Take a deep breath.
- Do it.

01:19:27.361 --> 01:19:29.126
My God!

01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:31.994
All right.
All right.

01:19:43.987 --> 01:19:46.911
- All right, good as new.
- Oh, God.

01:19:52.046 --> 01:19:53.012
Come here.

01:19:53.987 --> 01:19:56.911
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:59.949
Oh shit. Oh, shit, Jimmy.

01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:03.700
Oh, shit. Jimmy.
What are we gonna do?

01:20:03.903 --> 01:20:05.780
What are we gonna do?

01:20:06.862 --> 01:20:09.240
We're gonna wait for
the negotiator to show up.

01:20:11.986 --> 01:20:16.697
I'm not going back.
I'm not going back.

01:20:18.903 --> 01:20:21.372
We can't shoot our way outta here, bro.

01:20:23.153 --> 01:20:26.736
I'm not going back.
You hear me?

01:20:26.744 --> 01:20:29.663
- I'm not going back. Think of something.
- Yeah, all right. I know.

01:20:29.736 --> 01:20:31.238
- No, you gotta think of something.
- I know.

01:20:31.944 --> 01:20:34.447
- Come up with something.
- I know, all right?

01:20:36.027 --> 01:20:40.328
They're wolves in there, Jimmy.
They're wolves in there.

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:42.029
I can't go back.

01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:49.696
All right.  You just got
to do what I say, okay?

01:20:51.402 --> 01:20:52.994
Gotta do what I say.

01:20:58.693 --> 01:20:59.615
Fuck!

01:21:12.151 --> 01:21:15.655
...invested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:21:18.901 --> 01:21:22.530
Get back!  I got a hostage!
I'll kill her!  I'll kill her!

01:21:23.692 --> 01:21:25.990
Step back! You! You!

01:21:27.484 --> 01:21:28.781

01:21:53.858 --> 01:21:55.202
<i>Target down!</i>

01:22:04.816 --> 01:22:06.193
All right!

01:22:07.107 --> 01:22:08.576
All right!

01:22:10.524 --> 01:22:13.528
You put down your guns,
I'll let y'all live!

01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:22.068
All right,
I ain't going warn you no more!

01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:23.570
This is it!

01:23:08.605 --> 01:23:10.027

01:23:11.022 --> 01:23:12.774
Yeah, Frankie?

01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:15.903
I'm just a thief.

01:23:19.021 --> 01:23:20.568
All my life...

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.528

01:23:27.854 --> 01:23:30.528
And I stole from you.

01:23:36.771 --> 01:23:39.445
I stole from you, bro.

01:23:44.812 --> 01:23:46.280
Look at me.

01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:52.772
Do you forgive me, Jimmy?

01:23:59.645 --> 01:24:02.023
You're my brother, Frankie.

01:24:08.436 --> 01:24:09.938
I love you.

I love you, too, man.
