WEBVTT

00:11.262 --> 00:12.217
Ready?

00:14.015 --> 00:17.633
Take a deep breath.
Try again.

00:23.399 --> 00:24.354
Whoa!

00:25.818 --> 00:27.274
What did you
do that time?

00:27.987 --> 00:30.729
Beg the invisible threshold to
knock me on my ass, obviously!

00:30.990 --> 00:32.150
Was I not
supposed to?

00:32.408 --> 00:33.363
Most Fae have years

00:33.618 --> 00:35.574
to train for their
Rites of Passage,

00:35.828 --> 00:37.159
you have days before you
devolve into something

00:37.413 --> 00:38.653
l have to keep
in a cage.

00:38.915 --> 00:41.031
Haven't you always
wanted a pet?

00:42.001 --> 00:45.243
| see impending doom hasn't
affected your sense of humour.

00:45.504 --> 00:48.792
This has to say how to get
through the stupid door!

00:49.425 --> 00:51.165
Much is left
to interpretation.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.177
Like I told you--

00:52.428 --> 00:53.008
Yes!

00:53.262 --> 00:54.422
--to focus on the now.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.965
Shift consciousness
and achieve

00:56.224 --> 00:58.556
an effortless merging
of action and awareness --

00:58.809 --> 01:01.892
To allow yourself to cross
through the threshold.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.102
So I'm on
my own then.

01:06.025 --> 01:06.980
Okay...

01:10.613 --> 01:12.194
Focusing...

01:13.032 --> 01:14.397
shifting...

01:15.201 --> 01:16.611
merging...

01:18.829 --> 01:24.449
And |, Bo Dennis,
allow myself to pass.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.044
Ah!

01:30.216 --> 01:32.002
Fine! Plan B!

01:32.426 --> 01:33.176
No, Bo!

01:33.427 --> 01:34.758
You can't smash
your problems away.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.001
Oh, yeah?

01:36.264 --> 01:38.801
Did your ancient book sort
of tell you that too?

01:39.433 --> 01:40.388
I need a break.

01:40.643 --> 01:40.927
Now?

01:41.185 --> 01:42.766
No-- Trick,
this isn't working!

01:43.020 --> 01:45.272
Sometimes you just gotta know
when to fold 'em, you know?

01:45.523 --> 01:47.809
ljust wanna go home.

01:57.994 --> 01:59.109
Mm.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.152
Smell that?

02:02.039 --> 02:03.779
Reminds me of
being on the field,

02:04.041 --> 02:05.577
throwing TD's
for Grimley High.

02:05.835 --> 02:07.496
All | smell is cow crap.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.748
Do you even know
what you're doing?

02:10.006 --> 02:12.167
I've done my fair share
of tire swaps, okay?

02:12.425 --> 02:14.416
And you brought me out
here for what, cherries?

02:14.677 --> 02:16.713
Best damn
cherries in the world.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.177
I kinda thought my
fiancee would be interested

02:18.431 --> 02:19.591
to see where I grew up.

02:19.849 --> 02:21.714
I'd be in a better mood
if I had cell service.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.386
And if I wasn't
about to burst.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.054
Pick a spot, honey.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.765
I am not squatting
in that field.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.356
Fine! But if I'm not
back in five, it's on you.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.228
Watch out
for poison ivy.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.401
And snakes!

03:17.823 --> 03:18.983
Brad!

03:20.993 --> 03:21.982
Brad?

03:22.828 --> 03:23.738
Brad!

03:23.996 --> 03:25.577
Brad!

03:26.207 --> 03:27.367
Brad!

03:29.001 --> 03:31.583
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.336
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.168
My love carries
a death sentence.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.841
l was lost for years...

03:40.096 --> 03:41.961
Searching while hiding.

03:43.057 --> 03:46.174
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.559
I won't hide anymore.

03:48.813 --> 03:51.771
I will live
the life I choose.

03:58.197 --> 04:01.189
You say she's already
shown signs of devolution?

04:01.450 --> 04:02.200
She's desperate.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.736
Whether she
realizes it or not...

04:03.994 --> 04:07.578
Well, her condition could become
grave at a moment's notice.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.288
Is she still unaligned?

04:09.542 --> 04:10.998
Stubbornly so.

04:12.002 --> 04:12.832
Pa rents?

04:13.087 --> 04:15.794
Father, unknown.
Mother, a Succubus.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.717
And there are rumours
about Bo's-- potential.

04:23.848 --> 04:24.587
Oh dear.

04:24.849 --> 04:25.759
Oh dear that's
great news?

04:26.016 --> 04:28.507
Succubi already take
more preparation,

04:28.769 --> 04:31.727
and are at greater risk
of failing their Rites.

04:31.981 --> 04:32.561
Yes.

04:32.815 --> 04:35.773
But if your granddaughter is
as powerful as I've heard...

04:36.026 --> 04:38.358
a Fae's devolution is
directly proportionate

04:38.612 --> 04:39.727
to their abilities.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.480
Bo is extra special,
so she runs the risk

04:42.741 --> 04:44.572
of becoming...
extra UnderFae?

04:44.827 --> 04:48.786
The Bo you know
will cease to exist.

04:51.041 --> 04:54.579
And in her place will be
something extremely dangerous.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.831
Stella--
Please.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.584
I realize you're
in high demand.

04:59.842 --> 05:03.460
Fae seek my guidance years
in advance of The Dawning.

05:03.721 --> 05:06.303
And I thank you for
coming to meet with me.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.761
She's all l have left.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.934
Fetch me some tea?

05:20.196 --> 05:20.901
Absolutely.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.066
I'll need to
evaluate the subject.

05:24.617 --> 05:26.733
But not amidst
this horrible racket.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.701
Of course. I'll turn
down the music.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.923
BO: Mama! something
is happening to me!

05:51.185 --> 05:52.516
I think I killed Kyle!

05:52.770 --> 05:55.933
BO'S MOM: I warned you about
having relations with that boy!

05:56.190 --> 05:57.726
BO'S MOM:
You promised me!

05:58.984 --> 06:02.101
BO'S MOM: You have
the devil inside you, Beth!

06:05.032 --> 06:06.943
BO'S MOM:
You're a slut. A whore!

06:07.201 --> 06:08.782
BO'S MOM:
You're not my daughter.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.572
BO'S MOM:
You never were!

06:16.210 --> 06:16.619
[Gasp!]

06:16.877 --> 06:23.373
[Phone ringing]

06:25.427 --> 06:27.804
Trick.
It is two a.m.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.386
Well, no, I'm fine.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.552
l was just having
a weird nightmare.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.178
Yes.
I'll be right there.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.277
Chunky!

06:51.620 --> 06:52.996
So what does it say?

06:53.622 --> 06:56.580
Will I meet a brave knight and
marry all my problems away?

06:57.001 --> 06:58.741
Why deny
your fear, child?

06:59.003 --> 07:00.743
Because it's scary?

07:01.005 --> 07:01.960
[Clears throat]

07:04.216 --> 07:07.583
Sorry. I'm just a
little on edge, Miss--

07:07.845 --> 07:09.051
Stella Nashira.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.547
And a Lodestar's work
cannot be rushed.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.049
Stella has given guidance
to hundreds of our kind

07:15.311 --> 07:17.097
as they've prepared
for The Dawning.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.101
You harbour great rage.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.942
And great regret.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.026
These two negatives
are making it very hard

07:27.281 --> 07:29.112
for you
to know yourself.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.482
Embrace your
true identity.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.942
Well, everyone
has hang-ups.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.944
The blockage can
usually be traced back

07:36.206 --> 07:37.582
to some
childhood imprint.

07:37.833 --> 07:38.743
A parental source.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.741
God, it's always mommy
issues with you guys.

07:41.003 --> 07:44.871
Okay, look, Aife and I,
we had our problems.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.918
But, um, we
worked them out

07:47.176 --> 07:48.882
with good ol' fashioned
hand-to-hand combat.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.342
You call your
mother by her name?

07:50.596 --> 07:52.427
Did Aife not raise you?

07:52.681 --> 07:54.546
Aife is Bo's
biological mother.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.891
And she and her
adoptive mom, Mary,

07:58.145 --> 07:59.760
also had a falling out.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.558
Twice the mommies,
twice the baggage.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.602
You must confront the
source of your estrangement.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.320
No. I can't.
I won't!

08:07.571 --> 08:09.152
Your anger is hurting you.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.566
She hurt me--!

08:10.824 --> 08:12.360
You have
to go home, Bo.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.154
You must forgive.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.405
Like hell I do.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.573
Look, I will do whatever
it takes to survive this.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.994
But I will not spend
one more minute

08:22.252 --> 08:23.958
with that ignorant,
warped bigot.

08:24.213 --> 08:27.000
But you'll devolve
into an UnderFae.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.543
Then let's hope
it's a nice cage.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.343
What they're asking me
to do is out of the question.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.140
There has to be
another way.

08:43.399 --> 08:45.936
I could really use some of your
patented nerdness right now.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.525
Bo, I hate to say this,
but this is one of those cases

08:48.779 --> 08:51.566
where your Faeness
trumps my nerdness.

08:51.824 --> 08:53.564
I can only treat
the symptoms.

08:53.826 --> 08:55.942
I can't go back there!

08:56.829 --> 09:00.697
Well, I mean, it seems a shame
to miss the cherry festival.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.075
You Googled
my hometown?

09:07.840 --> 09:09.296
Bo.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.666
I know why you left.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.884
Kyle.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.132
If there had just been
some understanding...

09:20.811 --> 09:22.347
You know,
someone to talk to.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.140
They were simple people.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.354
Try not to blame them
for their ignorance.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.893
Don't defend them!

09:28.152 --> 09:30.768
My mother cast me out like
I was some kind of deviant!

09:31.029 --> 09:34.772
I can't even imagine how
difficult this must be for you.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.022
Bo...

09:36.285 --> 09:38.526
This could be
your only hope.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.030
It's a five-hour drive.

09:43.625 --> 09:44.751
Well, I will
go with you.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.492
You're practically
insane, anyway.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.369
You can't go
by yourself.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.248
No...

09:53.719 --> 09:55.334
I need you to stay here
and do some hard-core

09:55.596 --> 09:57.552
doctoring in case
this doesn't work out.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.468
Besides, I know someone
else who could use a road trip.

10:01.018 --> 10:01.928
Hm.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.551
How is Kenzi?

10:03.812 --> 10:05.928
With every new wig
comes another brave face.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.430
Do we know yet--

10:07.691 --> 10:09.647
why the Kitsune
targeted her?

10:11.195 --> 10:13.561
No and I didn't asked.
You know, she's still--

10:13.822 --> 10:15.232
No--
Of course.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.981
Of course.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.749
This formula will
inhibit cell degradation

10:31.006 --> 10:33.338
by freezing the
UnderFae cells that are trying

10:33.592 --> 10:37.335
to take over-- rendering
them temporarily sterile.

10:38.597 --> 10:41.339
If you feel yourself
starting to lose control,

10:41.600 --> 10:42.806
inject yourself.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.229
Even if you said
"in the eyeball",

10:46.480 --> 10:48.721
it still sounds more appealing
than talking to my Mom.

10:48.982 --> 10:49.732
Emergency use only.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.359
Those are
the last three.

10:51.610 --> 10:52.895
Why can't you
make more?

10:53.153 --> 10:56.987
The formula produces
diminishing returns.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.365
With every injection
it will work a little bit less.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.494
Wish me luck.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.217
I don't understand why
you're letting her go.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.221
She has to go.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.712
It is part of
Bo's preparation.

11:21.974 --> 11:24.886
I can't just sit by and watch
her lose everything, Trick!

11:25.811 --> 11:27.096
I can't lose Bo a--

11:29.606 --> 11:31.142
When did you
get it back?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.139
What?

11:32.401 --> 11:33.982
Your love, Dyson.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.776
Bo has Lauren now.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.607
Lauren's human.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.861
Their relationship
can only be--

11:42.619 --> 11:43.779
--short term.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.744
So in the short term,
I am not going to interfere.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.366
I love Bo too much
to screw it up again.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.879
Those feelings aren't something
you can just make go away.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.337
'Less you want to book another
meeting with the Norn...

11:55.591 --> 11:57.957
These feelings
will never go away.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.626
Not for me.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.962
How are we having this
conversation without booze?

12:10.606 --> 12:13.063
Her guide--
Uh... The Lodestar?

12:13.817 --> 12:14.567
Stella.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.145
She's the best.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.984
And quite
the locker too.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.236
Don't worry.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.114
Bo will make it
through this.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.157
There will be
a long term.

12:28.624 --> 12:29.158
Promise?

12:29.416 --> 12:31.407
Just do your shot.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.720
BO: So I tell that
holier—than-thou witch

12:45.974 --> 12:47.350
that I forgive her,
peel home

12:47.601 --> 12:48.716
and waltz right past
the threshold.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.808
KENZI: And if you go crazy,
ljust needle your butt.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.849
No problemo.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.562
With everything
that's been happening

13:01.823 --> 13:03.609
we haven't had much
of a chance to talk.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.734
Pepperoni sticks and
one pint of candy corn--

13:06.995 --> 13:10.579
the Kenzi is awesome.
Bloated, but awesome.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.743
Go! Come on, pump,
gas me!

13:13.001 --> 13:14.377
That rash you had...

13:14.628 --> 13:15.959
You ever figure out
how you got it?

13:16.213 --> 13:18.169
Go in your hole!

13:18.423 --> 13:19.959
Let me help you
with that, Ma'am.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.253
Hi!

13:22.511 --> 13:25.969
I seem to have attracted
the attention of country folk.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.506
Perhaps of the
bumpkin variety?

13:30.018 --> 13:30.803
Beth?

13:31.061 --> 13:32.301
Beth Dennis?

13:33.981 --> 13:35.016
Dougie?!

13:36.858 --> 13:37.722
Hi! Uh...

13:37.985 --> 13:40.943
You-- You two know each other?

13:41.196 --> 13:44.359
Yeah, Dougie and l were,
uh, friends in high school.

13:44.616 --> 13:45.776
Just Doug now.

13:46.034 --> 13:46.864
Nobody ever figured
we'd ever see

13:47.119 --> 13:48.734
Beth around here
ever again.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.111
Beth?

13:52.416 --> 13:53.155
Beth-- Yes!

13:53.417 --> 13:54.953
I guess, they
did catch the guy

13:55.210 --> 13:57.576
who actually killed
Kyle... so, woohoo!

13:57.838 --> 13:59.578
I mean, I'm not
celebrating the murder,

13:59.840 --> 14:01.580
dude died right
in front of you,

14:01.842 --> 14:02.752
just that
they caught him.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.750
It was
a long time ago.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.343
A lot has changed since then.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.847
Including my name.

14:08.098 --> 14:08.723
l'm Bo now.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.339
Ah, okay.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.306
So I guess you're here
for the Cherry Fest?

14:12.561 --> 14:13.801
See some
of the old gang?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.927
No, actually,
it's personal business.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.350
I'll be heading out of here
before the pie-off.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.233
[Whispering]
Pie Off?

14:19.484 --> 14:20.644
That's probably good.

14:20.902 --> 14:23.735
This whole area's just
hit the skids since you left.

14:23.989 --> 14:27.277
It's just like one string
of bad luck after another.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.158
And, of course,
there was the accident...

14:30.412 --> 14:30.776
Accident?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.323
Not the pies.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.579
You remember Brad?

14:34.833 --> 14:37.165
He was crushed by a car
by county line yesterday.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.159
Tell me Brad's
not a cow.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.833
No, Mr. Popular High
School Quarterback.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.708
He and Dougie-- Doug--
weren't exactly best bros.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.925
Used to pick on
Dougie's head pretty bad.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.341
But that was eons ago.
That Dougie's gone.

14:50.599 --> 14:51.634
Just like Brad...

14:53.393 --> 14:53.927
Whoa, whoa--

14:54.186 --> 14:55.221
You okay, babe?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.478
Yeah... it's, uh,
it's all that driving.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.565
Okay, uh, go splash
some water on your face.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.103
Cleanest pissers
in Grimley county.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.068
Yeah, Bo, you don't
wanna miss the pissers!

15:07.991 --> 15:08.741
How's it going?

15:08.992 --> 15:10.778
Just great, great!
Uh...

15:11.036 --> 15:14.199
Could you fill me up, please?
Thanks.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.378
Ready?

15:25.050 --> 15:26.335
Maybe I'll just
write a letter.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.925
Dude, you have taken
on The Morrigan.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.135
Your old lady
should be child's play.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.005
She taught me l was evil.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.347
Now I'm supposed
to tell her it's okay?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.058
It's called being
the bigger person.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.768
Which reminds me,
I wanna scarf down

15:39.022 --> 15:40.137
like twenty pies
on the way home.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.854
I don't wanna be
the bigger person.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.600
I am so sick of being
the bigger person!

15:44.861 --> 15:47.603
That bitch has said things to
me that echo inside my head!

15:47.864 --> 15:49.479
They scratch away
at the inside of my brain

15:49.741 --> 15:51.777
every night when
I'm trying to fall-- Ow!

15:54.037 --> 15:55.152
What the hell...?

15:55.413 --> 15:56.949
| ass-provised.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.741
Oh-- Was that not one
of your monster fits?

16:01.002 --> 16:03.084
You seemed
really angry!

16:03.338 --> 16:03.963
Did I just waste
one of these?

16:04.214 --> 16:06.250
Not if you wanted to help
me re-focus my rage.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.133
Well, you're welcome.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.999
Now get your
head in the game.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.717
It's time to face
the Mom music.

16:10.971 --> 16:11.835
Okay...

16:12.097 --> 16:13.928
Then we get the hell
out of here, right?

16:14.182 --> 16:15.922
Does a horse
shit in the barn?

16:16.601 --> 16:18.557
No, seriously, is
that where they poop?

16:20.397 --> 16:21.853
Just, keep
the car running.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.267
You got it, boss.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.450
[Knocking]

16:44.921 --> 16:46.036
Over here.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.501
Beth?

16:53.305 --> 16:54.715
Oh.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.713
Oh, finally--

16:56.975 --> 16:59.933
You've finally came home.
I've missed you so much.

17:02.606 --> 17:03.971
Mama?

17:16.161 --> 17:18.652
To think that you'd finally
come back and I didn't have

17:18.914 --> 17:21.747
a crumb of fresh pie for
you and your new friend.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.116
Yeah. Your mom's...
What a bitch...

17:24.377 --> 17:25.753
She used to be.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.166
I didn't exactly
give you any warning.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.749
Do you go
to Grimley High, too dear?

17:33.011 --> 17:35.127
Um... no.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.720
Mom, Kenzi's not
from around here.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.056
I've been away
a long time.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.722
That's what your
father always says.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.719
Said--

17:44.981 --> 17:46.141
Said.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.226
He's gone now--

17:48.485 --> 17:50.601
Your Aunt Bea always says
that I keep getting confused,

17:50.862 --> 17:52.363
and that I should
write things down.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.731
But really, I don't think
that she listens very well.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.573
Certainly not to me!

17:57.827 --> 17:59.328
Do you remember why I left?

17:59.579 --> 18:00.955
Well, you were lost.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.367
And the Lord helped
you find your way back.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.583
Oh! Oh--
I forgot the rhubarb.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.960
What happened to the
forgiveness so we can get back

18:10.215 --> 18:11.796
to your monster-proofing
training junk!

18:12.050 --> 18:13.915
It's like she doesn't
even remember.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.337
So, remind her.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.755
And break
her heart again?

18:17.013 --> 18:19.174
Two minutes ago you
wanted to break her face.

18:19.975 --> 18:21.135
Hello time-warp.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.929
It's like some kind
of Beth shrine.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.302
Well at least it's not creepy.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.137
BO:
This is who I was.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.889
KENZI:
The perfect daughter.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.773
KENZI: Underneath
the crimped hair...

18:31.027 --> 18:32.733
Until the night
I ruined it all.

18:32.988 --> 18:35.149
"Local teen murdered...

18:35.407 --> 18:37.739
Kyle Williams, 18, found
in the back of his car...

18:37.993 --> 18:40.735
foul play is suspected...
last seen with Beth Dennis,

18:40.996 --> 18:41.826
whereabouts unknown."

18:42.080 --> 18:43.365
She must have
kept that for a reason.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.330
Reason being she's
loco en la cabesa.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.120
I think the medical
term is dementia.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.744
Sorry-- Small towns
make me nervous.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.914
What harm could it do
to write one more chapter

18:54.175 --> 18:56.302
in Beth's book, huh?
On my terms, not hers.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.713
Trick and Lauren will kill me

18:57.971 --> 19:00.257
if I don't have you
home tout de suite!

19:02.392 --> 19:04.724
Where is my mind?

19:04.978 --> 19:06.889
You children have
to see the Cherry Fest!

19:07.147 --> 19:08.683
And see some
of your old friends.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.851
So, you go on while
I make dinner, okay--

19:11.109 --> 19:12.224
--Okay.
--Oh, no, we really...

19:12.485 --> 19:15.147
Not before you change
out of your city clothes.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.316
It is hot as the Devil's
own oven out there.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.735
Besides, um...
people will stare.

19:19.993 --> 19:20.948
We didn't
bring anything--

19:21.202 --> 19:22.738
Sweetheart, you have
lots of pretty dresses

19:22.996 --> 19:23.951
up in your closet.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.867
And your friend
can borrow one and...

19:27.125 --> 19:29.081
Maybe some
sensible footwear.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.201
[Whispering]
What is this place?

19:31.463 --> 19:33.328
You said you wanted
to have some fun.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.922
A country makeover?
Gee, I can't wait.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.130
MAN: Last chance, folks!
For the fifty-fifty!

19:41.806 --> 19:43.967
KENZI: I feel like I fell
in some Amish.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.090
Own it,
Laura Ingalls.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.852
P When you feel
the burning sun P

19:50.106 --> 19:53.940
P Lady Polly has her fun P

19:54.194 --> 19:57.561
D How many children
will she slay? P

19:57.822 --> 19:59.358
J’ One...two... J5 J’

19:59.616 --> 20:00.571
Cute song!

20:01.618 --> 20:03.483
Why are they trying
to trip each other?

20:03.745 --> 20:05.030
It's Double Dutch.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.372
You're shitting me!

20:06.623 --> 20:08.159
I thought that
was only on Wii!

20:08.416 --> 20:10.623
I was on the team.
Regional champs.

20:11.586 --> 20:12.541
Beth?

20:13.004 --> 20:13.868
Jessica!

20:14.130 --> 20:14.789
I thought
you'd disappeared,

20:15.048 --> 20:16.128
Miss Witness
Protection Program.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.123
Are you still living
up on the hill?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.124
Try Chicago.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.751
Holla!

20:21.012 --> 20:21.922
What's with
Debbie Gibson?

20:22.180 --> 20:23.044
Sharonda.

20:23.306 --> 20:23.715
Hi.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.759
Pleasure's all mine.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.637
So, you guys old
chewin' tobacco pals?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.056
Can you call someone a
"pal" if she beats you

20:31.314 --> 20:32.724
three years running
for Miss Cherry Blossom?

20:32.982 --> 20:34.438
Oh, my, did you get
to wear a sash?

20:34.692 --> 20:35.397
No.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.142
From the time Beth
popped those boobs,

20:37.404 --> 20:38.860
all the guys
had their eyes on her.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.321
I was a late bloomer--
but I'm over it.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.404
You sure are.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.069
The little tease
strung them all along.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.158
They'd do
anything for her.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.903
Except Brad.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.037
He was always mine.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.409
Jessica,
I am so sorry.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.713
I saw on Facebook that
he was coming out here.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.332
Ihoped
to run into him.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.129
I starved myself.
I lost six pounds...

21:02.387 --> 21:03.752
Yeah...
I could tell.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.390
It's really too bad
he got crushed by a car.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.260
What?
It is...

21:09.018 --> 21:10.804
He's gone
to a better place.

21:11.146 --> 21:13.057
Unlike the rest
of this county.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.938
Has it always
been so creepy?

21:16.192 --> 21:17.853
Yeah, with the
gorgeous sunshine,

21:18.111 --> 21:19.567
and the scent
of cherry blossom...

21:19.821 --> 21:22.358
God, it is even more
beautiful than I remember.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.731
Oh--
You're serious?

21:24.993 --> 21:25.652
Of course.

21:25.910 --> 21:26.774
In less
depressing news,

21:27.036 --> 21:28.572
we ran into
your old friend Doug.

21:28.830 --> 21:29.945
Hey, Doug!

21:33.168 --> 21:35.204
Ugh, he's still
such a creep!

21:36.171 --> 21:37.911
Coming back here,
it was such a mistake.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.915
Yeah, I think I've had about
all the nostalgia I can take.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.541
Well, Bo-Bo,
why don't we go-go

21:42.802 --> 21:44.133
have a chat-chat
with your Mom-mom...

21:44.387 --> 21:46.423
God, you are
so weird.

21:46.681 --> 21:46.919
Thank you.

21:47.182 --> 21:48.797
Reminds me of that girl,
who used to sniff glue

21:49.058 --> 21:50.184
in chem class.

21:50.435 --> 21:53.142
Jessica...
that was you.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.145
I hate this place.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.486
There she is...

22:07.827 --> 22:09.738
Okay, you two go
have your Mom-ment.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.488
I will grab your
clothes and my dignity.

22:20.632 --> 22:21.371
Mom?

22:21.633 --> 22:23.498
Oh, you're back!
Oh, you must be hungry?

22:23.760 --> 22:25.625
Would you like
something to--

22:26.387 --> 22:28.378
Mom, do you remember
the night that I left?

22:28.640 --> 22:30.551
The night
that Kyle died?

22:33.603 --> 22:36.265
You said some things
to me that really hurt.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.189
Mom!

22:40.985 --> 22:43.897
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say to you?

22:46.491 --> 22:48.607
Is that another
friend of yours, dear?

22:52.121 --> 22:53.577
That would be a no.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.740
Ok, Lady,
what's your deal?

22:58.169 --> 22:59.329
Bo! You okay?

22:59.587 --> 23:01.168
What the hell
was that thing?

23:01.422 --> 23:03.629
Just look at what
your filthy fornication

23:03.883 --> 23:05.123
has brought down
on this house!

23:05.385 --> 23:05.874
What?

23:06.135 --> 23:07.750
I told you to stay away,
you Devil child!

23:08.012 --> 23:10.344
You bring nothing
but pain and sorrow!

23:10.598 --> 23:13.340
I want you gone!
I want you out of my house!

23:14.018 --> 23:14.768
Bo!

23:15.019 --> 23:16.805
Bo!
What are you doing?!

23:17.063 --> 23:18.473
It is all my fault--

23:18.731 --> 23:20.141
It has always
been my fault.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.685
What's your fault?!

23:21.985 --> 23:25.148
Bo! Do not Dukes
of Hazzard on me!

23:26.197 --> 23:28.859
Bo! Please!
Please--

23:29.200 --> 23:31.156
Bo!

23:40.712 --> 23:42.452
KENZI: This was
supposed to be a simple

23:42.714 --> 23:43.669
in-and-out
Mommy-makeup mission.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.788
Has Bo buried the
hatchet with her mother?

23:46.050 --> 23:48.257
Well, she tried, but
then gross nightie lady

23:48.511 --> 23:50.422
tried to bury her
sickle in Bo's face.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.466
From what you're
telling me, we're dealing

23:52.724 --> 23:54.464
with one mean
UnderFae: Poludnica.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.637
Gee, I wonder why that name
isn't more popular...

23:56.894 --> 23:59.146
The locals sometimes
call her Lady Polly.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.397
"Who has her fun
in the burning sun..."

24:02.650 --> 24:03.400
Right.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.858
Hey, did you know
that double Dutch is real?

24:06.112 --> 24:08.148
Polly's M.O. is staging
accidents when the heat

24:08.406 --> 24:11.273
and the glare of midday
disorients her victims.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.569
You mean like
getting smushed

24:12.827 --> 24:14.442
by a car when
changing your tire?

24:14.704 --> 24:15.284
That'd be her.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.199
When Bo finds out she
unleashed hell on the town

24:17.457 --> 24:19.994
by succu-killing Kyle,
she's gonna succu-plotz, Trick.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.115
No, that's
impossible.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.208
Kyle '5 death was
merely a Fae feed.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.454
Polly can only be
awakened by humans

24:25.715 --> 24:27.706
and released amidst
fire and brimstone.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.048
So who
summoned her?

24:30.303 --> 24:33.045
Probably the same
people she's been killing.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.724
Bo's former
classmates...

24:40.104 --> 24:41.435
They finally
all came home,

24:41.689 --> 24:43.475
and Lady Polly's
offing them.

24:43.733 --> 24:47.066
"Well house burns...
arson suspected..."

24:47.320 --> 24:48.070
Oh, boy...

24:48.321 --> 24:50.858
Poludnica can't stray
from county lines.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.025
She's bound
to the land.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.819
But if she
kills the humans

24:54.077 --> 24:55.817
who summoned her
from the ground--

24:56.079 --> 24:58.411
Tornado Tits can flee
this one horse town, yeah.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.621
Hey, you said
summoned from the land,

25:00.875 --> 25:02.536
what about summoned
from a well?

25:02.794 --> 25:04.455
Sure.
Polly is an elemental.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.043
She could be
trapped in water.

25:06.297 --> 25:07.833
Ok. Good to know.

25:08.091 --> 25:09.831
And Kenzi, don't let
Bo get distracted.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.425
She needs to forgive her
mother and get back here.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.840
I hear ya loud
and clear, boss.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.680
I just have
to... find her.

25:18.101 --> 25:18.931
You've lost Bo?

25:19.185 --> 25:21.096
No, I'm on it.
Missing the cow-tipping.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.935
I'm so sorry.
Thank you. Bye!

25:23.189 --> 25:24.395
Kenzi!

25:32.281 --> 25:33.612
Yo! Uh...Mom!

25:33.866 --> 25:37.233
I'm borrowing the car!
Okay!

25:49.090 --> 25:50.250
Delicious.

25:51.092 --> 25:52.047
One more.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.427
Ma'am,
these are samples.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.760
I'll have you know,
I was Miss Cherry Blossom

25:56.013 --> 25:57.469
three times over.

25:57.724 --> 25:58.338
More.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.971
Now!

26:00.893 --> 26:01.973
There you are!

26:02.520 --> 26:03.555
In the flesh.

26:03.813 --> 26:06.179
And on the sauce.
Great.

26:06.899 --> 26:10.266
I am so angry
and itchy--

26:11.446 --> 26:13.732
And everything smells
so overpowering--

26:13.990 --> 26:14.399
Uh oh--

26:14.657 --> 26:16.022
I'm hungry.

26:19.871 --> 26:22.237
And cherry pie
ain't gonna cut it.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.038
Look at them all...

26:25.293 --> 26:27.375
Horny corn-fed
farm boys...

26:27.628 --> 26:29.334
Buxom milk maids.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.453
I think you're projecting.

26:30.715 --> 26:31.921
I want to taste them all.

26:32.175 --> 26:33.756
Bo. Hey!

26:34.010 --> 26:35.250
You're changing, okay?

26:35.511 --> 26:36.421
You've got
to fight it.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.261
Oh, Kenzi,
I'm not changing--

26:39.515 --> 26:41.847
I'm not changing
into a monster.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.557
I've always been one.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.642
I've done so many
terrible things--

26:45.897 --> 26:47.478
So many
terrible things...

26:47.732 --> 26:49.393
And that is why
The Dawning is

26:49.650 --> 26:51.481
happening
to me so soon.

26:51.736 --> 26:54.068
Okay, I am just gonna
perch here yonder

26:54.322 --> 26:56.358
so we can talk--
Okay?

26:56.616 --> 26:58.356
Let me tell you
about the time

26:58.618 --> 27:00.324
my best friend and I,
went on this road trip?

27:00.578 --> 27:02.034
Let me tell
you... it was--

27:02.288 --> 27:02.617
Hi-ya!

27:02.872 --> 27:03.827
Ow!

27:05.291 --> 27:06.041
Oh, I'm sorry--

27:06.292 --> 27:07.828
I'm sorry.
Agan.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.410
Thank you.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.047
One strike left.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.623
But lucky for you,
I have good news.

27:14.884 --> 27:17.421
Okay, your first Fae
feed had nothing to do

27:17.678 --> 27:19.054
with releasing
Lady Polly.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.045
She can only be
summoned with fire.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.843
And look:
"Well house burns..."

27:23.100 --> 27:24.476
That's probably
what released her.

27:24.727 --> 27:25.807
Oh, Kenzi...

27:26.729 --> 27:28.094
I was there.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.435
Okay, I'll just--
I'll put that away.

27:31.692 --> 27:32.442
Oh, my God--

27:32.693 --> 27:34.684
More wine
for the lady, please!

27:36.656 --> 27:38.396
BO: Dougie was going
through his Occult phase.

27:38.658 --> 27:39.818
He believed he
could communicate

27:40.076 --> 27:42.032
with the town's local legend,
the supposed bogeywoman

27:42.286 --> 27:43.036
of the countryside--

27:43.287 --> 27:43.946
KENZI:
Lady Polly.

27:44.205 --> 27:44.830
Right.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.447
He led us through a seance
at the old well house.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.415
Brad, Jessica,
Kyle and-- me.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.331
But nothing happened,
it didn't work--

27:52.588 --> 27:53.703
Obviously, it worked.

27:53.965 --> 27:56.456
We lit some candles,
we must have left one burning.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.173
Later that night
I was with Kyle

27:58.427 --> 28:00.258
and I never thought
about the seance again.

28:00.513 --> 28:01.628
Killing your boyfriend
was the second

28:01.889 --> 28:03.004
shittiest thing
you did that night.

28:03.266 --> 28:04.051
Kenzi!

28:04.308 --> 28:05.468
I'm sorry, wow--
That's not helping.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.058
Okay, look, Bo, you
have enough on your plate.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.644
All right? Can you just
forget about saving the county?

28:10.898 --> 28:12.138
Save yourself.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.436
There's gotta be a way to get
rid of that midday bitch.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.481
Trick said only those who summon
Poll-ski can send her back.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.649
I'll find Jessica.
You grab Dougie.

28:19.907 --> 28:20.441
Gas station round up.
Got it.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.156
Meet at the well.
If we're together

28:22.410 --> 28:23.445
I can keep us safe
and lure back Polly.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.067
Like, bait?

28:24.328 --> 28:25.579
If you're up for it.

28:33.296 --> 28:34.251
Jess?

28:39.093 --> 28:40.173
Jessica!

28:48.311 --> 28:50.768
I need some
help over here!

28:53.900 --> 28:55.060
Fine.

28:55.318 --> 28:58.060
Fire and brimstone it is.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.030
Paging the Lord
of The Bumpkins!

29:07.288 --> 29:08.494
Kenzi?

29:08.748 --> 29:10.033
I thought you and Bo
were going home.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.748
We got a little bit
of business to take care of.

29:14.086 --> 29:14.836
Okay--

29:15.087 --> 29:16.827
How do I say this
in Farm Speak?

29:17.089 --> 29:19.671
Um, minor
Tornado lady issue.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.041
We've got a date with a
burned-down well house.

29:21.302 --> 29:23.042
I warned you!
I told you to leave--

29:23.304 --> 29:24.259
Why didn't you
listen to me?!

29:24.513 --> 29:25.764
Whoa!

29:26.015 --> 29:27.846
Don't go all Children of
the Corn on me, Dougie--

29:28.100 --> 29:29.385
It's Doug!

29:29.894 --> 29:30.679
Dougie's dead.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.098
And if we wanna
get rid of Lady Polly?

29:33.356 --> 29:35.438
We're gonna have
to give her a sacrifice.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.192
I nominate Dougie.
He's dead anyways.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.604
This isn't a joke,
Kenzi!

29:42.281 --> 29:45.068
Wait, back up--
You knew that Lady Polly

29:45.326 --> 29:48.068
escaped the well
and was killing people?

29:48.329 --> 29:50.615
I've been trying to get rid
of her for almost ten years.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.824
I invoked her during
a teenage Goth stage.

29:55.086 --> 29:56.417
You were Goth?
Here?

29:56.671 --> 29:59.413
I had to go two towns over
to get my favorite guy-liner.

29:59.674 --> 30:01.380
Dude, I just don't
understand why

30:01.634 --> 30:03.170
you wouldn't tell
anybody about Polly?

30:03.427 --> 30:04.758
People are dying.

30:05.012 --> 30:06.627
You don't think
I know that?

30:06.889 --> 30:09.005
After Kyle died,
everyone left town.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.847
I thought it was over,
that Lady Polly

30:11.102 --> 30:12.057
couldn't get to them.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.427
No matter how much
she taunted me...

30:14.689 --> 30:16.395
they were safe.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.230
Oh, Dougie...

30:18.484 --> 30:19.564
She--

30:19.819 --> 30:21.434
She told me
to lure them all home,

30:21.696 --> 30:23.027
but I wouldn't do it.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.817
But now they're coming
home and Brad's dead.

30:26.575 --> 30:27.735
And Jessica
and Beth are next.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.234
Hey!
She's Bo now.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.702
Trust me-- that makes
all the difference.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.041
Shit!

30:38.295 --> 30:40.251
LP came
to the party early!

30:40.506 --> 30:42.838
Come on! We can
lose her in the field!

30:43.092 --> 30:43.956
Oh, great!

30:44.218 --> 30:46.004
Nothing bad ever
happens in the field!

30:46.262 --> 30:47.422
Wait up!

30:51.892 --> 30:53.018
Bo!

30:54.395 --> 30:55.805
Where's Jessica?
We need three of us!

30:56.063 --> 30:56.848
She's dead.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.471
Lady Polly staged
another "accident".

30:58.733 --> 31:00.064
Poor Jessica
choked on a cherry.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.306
Dammit!

31:01.569 --> 31:03.730
P.S.: Senorita Shitstorm
is hot on our heels.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.148
I need to stop the
spirit of Lady Polly

31:05.406 --> 31:07.522
before she kills again.
This whole thing is my fault!

31:07.783 --> 31:09.159
Dougie, what are
you talking about?

31:09.410 --> 31:10.946
Back in high school,
after the séance,

31:11.203 --> 31:13.410
all you guys coupled off
and you left me alone.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.495
I knew I could connect
with the paranormal.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.287
Paranormal?
Don't you mean paraweird?

31:18.544 --> 31:20.045
I had my occult book
and my candles--

31:20.296 --> 31:22.252
And I burnt a copy
of Antichrist Superstar

31:22.506 --> 31:23.131
as an offering.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.838
You sacrificed
"Superstar"?!

31:25.092 --> 31:26.468
Dude,
Marilyn Manson is a god.

31:26.719 --> 31:27.629
I kicked
the candle over!

31:27.887 --> 31:28.797
So what?

31:29.055 --> 31:30.511
I burnt down the building!
I released her!

31:30.765 --> 31:31.629
Dougie,
it was an accident.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.052
She is the one killing
people for fun.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.016
She is the one
who's evil!

31:45.863 --> 31:47.023
Look who
just blew in.

31:47.281 --> 31:48.612
She blows,
all right.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.322
Lady Polly,
Leave her!

31:50.701 --> 31:51.451
I'll be your sacrifice.

31:51.702 --> 31:52.817
Dougie!
You were just a kid.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.319
You didn't know
what you were doing.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.990
It wasn't your fault!

31:57.083 --> 31:57.742
No--

31:58.000 --> 31:59.035
[Whack!]

31:59.293 --> 32:00.248
Doug!

32:00.503 --> 32:01.743
Prepare to die...

32:08.094 --> 32:11.461
You will be my
greatest accident!

32:13.099 --> 32:14.214
Kenzi!

32:15.309 --> 32:16.594
Ass-provise!

32:20.272 --> 32:21.387
Uh!

32:27.863 --> 32:29.399
Your eyes--

32:30.658 --> 32:32.319
They are like mine--

32:32.576 --> 32:33.611
I am Fae...

32:33.869 --> 32:36.326
But I am
nothing like you.

32:36.872 --> 32:40.410
Sometimes you just
have to go home.

32:40.668 --> 32:43.205
Whether you
want to or not!

32:43.671 --> 32:44.501
Whack!

32:50.094 --> 32:51.379
Nice kick.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.261
[Slam!]

32:57.101 --> 32:58.637
I guess she wasn't
feeling very "well."

32:58.894 --> 33:00.600
Not feeling
very "well?"

33:00.855 --> 33:01.594
Oh, sweetie--

33:01.856 --> 33:03.221
I'm still getting
my mojo back.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.892
You okay?

33:05.985 --> 33:07.350
Is he?

33:07.987 --> 33:08.817
--Come on.
--Dougie!

33:09.071 --> 33:10.607
Come on, Doug.
Come on...

33:10.865 --> 33:11.570
Come on...

33:11.824 --> 33:12.779
Ugh.

33:13.284 --> 33:14.399
Okay.
We got ya.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.070
Oh, what happened?

33:17.663 --> 33:19.403
Did we get her
back in the well?

33:19.665 --> 33:22.031
Ain't no celebrities gonna
be taking up that cause.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.033
Did I help?

33:25.880 --> 33:27.416
We couldn't have
done it without ya.

33:27.673 --> 33:28.423
Doug.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.039
High-five!

33:33.888 --> 33:34.718
So.

33:34.972 --> 33:36.428
Whadya say we
get out of hicksville

33:36.682 --> 33:38.422
and I get you back
to Trick stat?

33:38.684 --> 33:39.844
One more stop.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.184
Someone else
I need to talk to.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.223
Come on, buddy.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.563
It's all over...

34:06.295 --> 34:07.250
Mom?

34:08.505 --> 34:09.460
Beth!

34:10.716 --> 34:12.456
How was Cherry Fest?

34:12.718 --> 34:14.458
Did you make a lot
of new friends?

34:14.720 --> 34:17.837
People are always just falling
in love with you, aren't they?

34:21.101 --> 34:22.716
Well, of course I do.

34:23.479 --> 34:25.310
You and your new
friend had just changed

34:25.564 --> 34:26.428
into your summer clothes.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.396
I'm old, but
I'm not that old.

34:28.651 --> 34:30.232
[Laughing]

34:39.662 --> 34:42.449
Mom, there have
been a lot of things

34:42.706 --> 34:44.822
that I've wanted to say
to you over the years.

34:45.084 --> 34:48.292
And it took me a long time
to realize the things I did

34:48.545 --> 34:50.627
when I was younger
were beyond my control.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.211
I still do.
A lot of them.

34:57.513 --> 34:58.844
And I'm sorry.

35:00.516 --> 35:03.258
You don't need
to be sorry, sweetheart.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.885
Oh, you are
such a good girl.

35:07.481 --> 35:09.813
It's strange to hear
that coming from you.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.022
I am good, you know?

35:19.910 --> 35:20.865
Aww...

35:22.288 --> 35:24.574
You always make
everything better.

35:26.875 --> 35:30.038
Do you remember
that Sunday in Church

35:30.296 --> 35:32.833
when that dying butterfly
came through the window

35:33.090 --> 35:36.423
and it landed on your hand
and you tried to help it fly

35:36.677 --> 35:38.633
and it just couldn't.

35:40.514 --> 35:42.596
You cried all day.

35:45.102 --> 35:46.638
You remember that?

35:47.688 --> 35:50.805
Your father and I tell each
other that story all the time.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.402
Mom, I know that you
thought the way you chose

35:56.655 --> 35:58.520
to raise me was right.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.406
I see that now.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.447
When you screamed and
yelled at me like I was evil,

36:04.705 --> 36:07.822
it's because you didn't
really understand who I was.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.241
Neither did I.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.253
We were both scared.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.247
Scared? No--
No, no--

36:17.509 --> 36:20.171
You don't need
to be scared, no...

36:25.309 --> 36:28.142
I have
a family, Mama.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.812
And they love and protect
me without question.

36:32.066 --> 36:34.398
That girl that
I came here with?

36:34.651 --> 36:36.903
She's like my sister.

36:37.154 --> 36:40.612
When I'm with her, I know
everything is going to be okay.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.822
And I found
my grandfather, mama.

36:43.077 --> 36:44.863
And guess what?
He...

36:45.120 --> 36:47.406
Uh, he cares about me.

36:50.501 --> 36:52.833
I don't know what
I'd do without him.

36:54.505 --> 36:56.587
Without any of them.

37:00.511 --> 37:02.843
If you really
knew me now...

37:05.307 --> 37:07.673
...you would be proud.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.017
I did good.

37:14.691 --> 37:19.025
And I don't need to carry around
those terrible memories anymore.

37:19.279 --> 37:22.612
I am done--
[Crying]

37:22.866 --> 37:25.448
I am done reliving them,
and reliving them,

37:25.702 --> 37:27.658
and reliving them--

37:28.497 --> 37:30.658
But... Beth...

37:31.083 --> 37:34.826
Your pies
are so beautiful.

37:37.714 --> 37:38.624
It's okay.

37:41.301 --> 37:44.464
This is how I'm going
to remember you.

37:46.682 --> 37:48.422
As the sweet woman
who taught me how

37:48.684 --> 37:50.470
to make the best pies.

37:55.691 --> 37:58.273
You had
a hard life, too.

38:05.659 --> 38:07.695
I can't hate
you anymore.

38:10.873 --> 38:13.455
And I'm done
hating myself.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.294
I'm not
the devil, Mama.

38:23.093 --> 38:24.629
I'm Fae.

38:27.097 --> 38:28.837
I'm Bo.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.026
Goodbye, Mom.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.657
I love you too--

38:52.289 --> 38:53.654
Bo.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.693
DYSON: Trick?

39:37.292 --> 39:40.409
[Stereo music playing]

39:40.671 --> 39:42.457
TRICK:
No, no, no, no, no!

39:42.714 --> 39:44.045
She requires silence!

39:45.300 --> 39:46.005
Who?

39:46.510 --> 39:47.420
Stella!

39:47.678 --> 39:48.793
She's on her way.

39:50.681 --> 39:52.637
Actually I think
she's just arrived.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.047
Sorry for the racket.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.595
I'll have the bar
cleared out in an instant.

39:58.272 --> 39:58.931
Has Bo returned?

39:59.189 --> 40:00.520
She's on her
way as we speak.

40:00.774 --> 40:03.937
Good.
Let's prepare for her test.

40:08.865 --> 40:13.234
The threshold, it's
in your office, right?

40:13.495 --> 40:14.826
Yes!

40:15.080 --> 40:16.240
Of course.

40:16.498 --> 40:17.613
My office.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.616
Just the two of us.
Perfect.

40:22.504 --> 40:23.459
Trick?

40:24.506 --> 40:27.043
I hope you haven't
misjudged me.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.924
Sometimes
even I like it loud.

40:38.854 --> 40:40.014
[Chuckling]

40:40.272 --> 40:43.014
I knew she was Trick bait
as soon as I saw her.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.231
Trick bait?
You're crazy.

40:45.485 --> 40:46.941
That no-nonsense
ball-buster thing

40:47.195 --> 40:50.232
she's got going on?
That's like crack to you.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.321
I'm in trouble,
aren't I?

40:52.576 --> 40:56.410
But you have no reason to keep
your feelings under wraps.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.695
Enjoy.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.049
Aren't you going
to wait for Bo?

41:09.676 --> 41:11.792
I'd just be
in the way.

41:19.853 --> 41:22.435
Salutations, from the
Grimley Cherry Festival!

41:22.689 --> 41:23.678
Thank you!

41:24.066 --> 41:25.602
How'd it go?
Did you grant forgiveness?

41:25.859 --> 41:26.939
Oh, I forgave someone.

41:27.194 --> 41:28.980
Let's just hope I passed
Stella's little riddle--

41:31.698 --> 41:33.438
and spirit in a
state of oneness...

41:33.700 --> 41:35.201
Yes, Mrs. Miagi.

41:35.452 --> 41:37.317
So what happens
when I pass?

41:37.704 --> 41:39.410
When you're ready
to enter the temple--

41:39.665 --> 41:40.620
What--
There's a temple?

41:40.874 --> 41:42.614
The Rites
of Passage vary.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.616
Some physical,
some psychological.

41:44.878 --> 41:46.038
It's different
for each Fae.

41:46.296 --> 41:48.252
Which is why
time is of the essence.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.623
Then let's cut
to the chase.

41:59.851 --> 42:00.385
You did it!

42:00.644 --> 42:02.384
I did it!
I did! I did!

42:02.646 --> 42:03.635
Look! Look!

42:03.897 --> 42:05.808
I just successfully merged
action and awareness!

42:06.066 --> 42:07.146
I'm so proud of you!

42:07.401 --> 42:08.891
So this temple
that you speak of--

42:09.152 --> 42:11.234
Is there a dress code?
Do they take reservations?

42:11.488 --> 42:13.729
You've performed
one simple task.

42:14.491 --> 42:16.447
Now, the real
training begins.

42:16.702 --> 42:18.442
Crossing the threshold
only allows you access

42:18.704 --> 42:20.615
to the temple.
Where the most

42:20.872 --> 42:23.830
gruelling challenges
of your life await you.

42:24.668 --> 42:26.249
Oh, crud.

42:29.631 --> 42:31.417
--Hey.
--Hey! How'd it go?

42:31.675 --> 42:32.425
Great!

42:33.802 --> 42:35.713
Trick's gonna set up
a trust for my Mom.

42:35.971 --> 42:37.381
Sherbe
taken care of.

42:37.639 --> 42:38.754
Wicked.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.594
Can Trick set
me up a trust?

42:41.852 --> 42:43.217
Oh, and I crossed
the threshold!

42:43.478 --> 42:45.014
I mean, there's still
tons more training

42:45.272 --> 42:46.432
and there's
a temple, but--

42:46.690 --> 42:48.305
Come again?

42:48.567 --> 42:51.479
I feel better than I have
in a really long time.

42:52.696 --> 42:53.401
Thanks again
for coming.

42:53.655 --> 42:54.519
Of course.

42:54.781 --> 42:58.490
My goodness, it was
godly farm-fed fun!

42:59.661 --> 43:02.152
Kenzi, you can't keep
hiding behind your jokes.

43:02.664 --> 43:04.245
Sure I can.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.456
I'm worried
about you.

43:07.294 --> 43:08.750
I'm just glad to be home.

43:09.671 --> 43:10.831
With you.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.717
But I can't talk
about it yet.

43:20.474 --> 43:21.759
Okay...

43:23.852 --> 43:25.717
Then let's talk
about something else.

43:28.690 --> 43:31.682
Kenzi, why did you
go see the Norn?
