[music]

00:03.737 --> 00:07.007
[theme music]

00:09.043 --> 00:10.378
DJ, get down here.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.314
Your grandma's going to be
here to pick you up any second.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.715
DJ: I have homework.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.850
You can do it in the car.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.352
DJ: I'm sick.

00:18.386 --> 00:21.589
You can do that
in the car, too.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.324
I don't want to
go to the ballet.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.293
Ballets are for girls.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.895
DJ, ballets aren't
just for girls.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.029
They're fun.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.965
And you know, you just
might learn something.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.401
Jeez.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.203
Yeah, he's going to
learn how to mince around

00:35.236 --> 00:37.338
in public wearing tights.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.406
Why the ballet?

00:38.439 --> 00:40.174
Because we get rid
of him for two days.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.343
You know, and if he comes
back with certain awakenings,

00:42.376 --> 00:44.245
well, we had the weekend.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.551
Morning.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.086
Where'd you hide
Becky's present?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.187
In the cereal.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.588
What if she eats it?

00:54.622 --> 00:59.327
Dan, other people look
at their food first.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.295
What are you doing, Becky?

01:01.329 --> 01:02.830
Looking for a job.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.698
Oh well, in that case,
you'll need some cereal.

01:04.732 --> 01:05.799
I'll get it.

01:05.833 --> 01:06.700
Thanks.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.035
I'm not that hungry.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.537
You're going to need your
strength if you're going to be

01:09.570 --> 01:10.571
out there looking for work.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.672
All right.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.341
I guess I'll have some
toast or something.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.442
What's the matter?

01:14.475 --> 01:16.710
You're too good for
cereal all of a sudden?

01:16.744 --> 01:17.611
Fine.

01:17.645 --> 01:18.446
I'll have cereal.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.022
Oh my god.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.258
What's this check for?

01:30.291 --> 01:31.592
That's enough
for a full semester

01:31.625 --> 01:34.295
at the community college,
assuming none of your classes

01:34.328 --> 01:36.730
require books.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.332
Can you guys afford this?

01:38.366 --> 01:40.701
Well, funniest thing
happened the other day.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.404
I was out shooting at some
food, when up to the ground,

01:43.437 --> 01:46.440
come a-bubblin' crude.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.376
And I circled some of the
courses that you might be

01:48.409 --> 01:51.945
interested in, particularly this
Classics of World Literature

01:51.979 --> 01:53.514
there so you can
understand what me

01:53.547 --> 01:56.016
and your daddy is talkin'
about around the dinner table.

01:56.049 --> 01:59.019
Man, you guys.
This is so great.

01:59.052 --> 01:59.853
I'm going to go tell Mark.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.492
Well, Dan.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.459
We got two.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.360
Count them.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.496
Two daughters in college.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.563
Yeah.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.698
We're going to have
a lot of explaining

02:10.731 --> 02:13.634
to do at the next
white trash luncheon.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.403
BEVERLY: (SINGING)
Chicago, Chicago.

02:15.436 --> 02:18.272
This ain't Grandma's town.

02:18.306 --> 02:21.642
Mom, she's singing.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.044
Hello, everybody.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.047
I was thinking, since
DJ and I are going

02:27.080 --> 02:29.417
to spend a weekend in Chicago,
wouldn't it be wonderful

02:29.450 --> 02:31.952
if we dropped in on Darlene?
- Mom?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.555
Darlene and the ballet?

02:34.588 --> 02:38.759
Christmas has come early for
a certain little boy I know.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.162
Now tomorrow
night, don't wait up.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.398
We won't be back until after 10.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.299
Oh, Bev.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.967
You'll be back before that.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.802
It's only a two hour drive.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.038
55 is the speed limit, Dan.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.139
The limit.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.709
It doesn't mean you
have to go that fast.

02:55.743 --> 02:59.079
Meanest Mom alive.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.414
Hey, Mom.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.684
Just last week, DJ was asking
me about big band leaders.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.085
Well, that is lucky.

03:05.118 --> 03:09.957
I have the whole KTEL Fabulous
Forties Collection in the car.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.392
Get ready to swing.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.098
Are you going to tell
Darlene they're coming?

03:18.131 --> 03:19.066
No.
I want her to be there.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.772
Well, what have we here?

03:24.805 --> 03:27.775
"Yuletide greetings,
Delaware Street dwellers."

03:27.808 --> 03:29.643
From the Neighborhood
Association.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.613
Oh, them mow your lawn people?

03:32.646 --> 03:34.682
"This holiday season
we're asking everyone

03:34.715 --> 03:37.117
to restrict their decorations
to simple white lights

03:37.150 --> 03:40.087
in order to avoid eyesores,
such as last year's

03:40.120 --> 03:44.858
faded plastic Santas and
three legged reindeer."

03:44.892 --> 03:46.360
Well, what are we
supposed to do with them?

03:46.394 --> 03:49.363
Shoot 'em?

03:49.397 --> 03:51.632
They've singled us out, honey.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.935
We're the tackiest house
in the whole neighborhood.

03:54.968 --> 04:02.876
Well, this year, I say we
go for the national title.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.526
DAVID: This really
sucks, Darlene.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.728
I'll stay here alone on
Christmas in this room

04:54.762 --> 04:56.964
with no one to talk to.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.500
Well, why don't you
just come home with me?

04:59.533 --> 05:00.868
Right.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.036
Like your mom's going to believe
I left my mom for Christmas.

05:03.070 --> 05:03.937
Well, fine.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.139
Then stay.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.409
Well, I'm going to have to eat
which means I'll have to spend

05:08.442 --> 05:10.110
that money we've been saving.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.912
$112?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.313
No way.

05:13.347 --> 05:16.750
My mom never spent that much
money on food my whole life.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.185
Never mind.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.453
[knock]

05:19.487 --> 05:20.921

to see "The Nutcracker"

05:23.223 --> 05:25.258
and he brought you a
singing Grandma-gram.

Move, move.

05:26.727 --> 05:27.928
Oh my God.

Your grandmother

05:29.129 --> 05:31.999
and DJ are at your door.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.869
Your grandmother and
DJ are at your door.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.605
Oh, surprise.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.907
We're here for the weekend.

05:39.940 --> 05:40.874
And you're staying here?

05:40.908 --> 05:41.775
Oh, no.

05:41.809 --> 05:42.676
Don't be silly.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.678
We're staying at Aunt Shirley's.

05:44.712 --> 05:48.215
Oh, it's so great to see you.

05:48.248 --> 05:52.085
This place smells like feet.

05:52.119 --> 05:55.523
So this is how the artsy
kids are living today?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.224
My.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.760
You know, I'm taking
a ceramics class.

05:59.793 --> 06:00.994
We have a lot in common.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.467
I gotta go to the bathroom.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.367
No.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.802
Oh now, Darlene.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.203
Just let the boy go.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.540
Holding it too long could harm
his ability to have children.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.612
Well, look at this place.

06:18.646 --> 06:22.550
It's so charming.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.419
And how binding is your lease?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.824
Grandma, I really
like it here.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.726
Of course you do, dear.

06:32.760 --> 06:37.197
Filth is fun when you're young.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.967
Come on, DJ.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.102
Darlene, we'll pick you
up at noon tomorrow.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.638
I've bought you a ticket
to "The Nutcracker."

06:44.672 --> 06:47.775
They have dancing mice.
- Well, gee.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.176
Grandma, I have those here.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.214
Hi, DJ.
- Hi, Darlene.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.623
Grandma, can we go shopping?

07:02.656 --> 07:04.658
I thought you
didn't want to shop.

07:04.692 --> 07:05.726
I changed my mind.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.795
I want to spend my money.

07:07.828 --> 07:11.532
All $112 of it.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.468
$112?

07:14.502 --> 07:17.004
My, where'd you get that?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.773
I earned it.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.643
[music playing]

07:25.713 --> 07:27.515
Two mangers.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.350
Wow, dueling saviors.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.285
Yahoo.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.087
And that's not all.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.055
Ta da.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.358
Liberace.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.862
Because there was no
room at the Desert Inn.

07:41.895 --> 07:42.963
Thank you.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.197
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.132
Thank you.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.534
Well, you did
pretty good, Dan.

07:46.567 --> 07:52.640
But I'm afraid all of your stuff
pales in comparison to my find.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.175
You see, Ponchos
went out of business.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.054
Behold, the Goddess of Tacky.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.026
I'll see you after I pick
up the application, OK?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.161
By the way, thanks
for the money.

08:14.194 --> 08:18.465
That was really
cool of you guys.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.768
Where's he going?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.836
Well, Mark and I
talked things over.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.838
And we decided the best
way to use the money would

08:24.872 --> 08:26.974
be to send Mark to school.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.208
Hey, wait a minute.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.510
That's supposed to be Becky
money, not Mark money.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.179
Well, there's this
new course at the tech

08:32.212 --> 08:33.581
school on how to run a garage.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.115
In six months, he'll be
able to get a good job

08:35.148 --> 08:36.249
and pay for my college.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.484
Wake up, Becky.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.653
In six months, you
couldn't teach him to pull

08:39.687 --> 08:40.988
his hand off a hot burner.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.160
Dad, wouldn't you rather pay
for six months of his college

08:47.194 --> 08:49.096
than four years of mine?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.698
You know, that does--

08:50.731 --> 08:52.232
Dan, we worked
hard for that money.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.701
That could have been
our dream vacation

08:53.734 --> 08:57.905
to Dollywood and Twitty City.

08:57.938 --> 08:58.806
Dad?

08:58.839 --> 08:59.707
Dan?

08:59.740 --> 09:00.608
Daddy?

09:00.641 --> 09:01.642
Danny?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.076
Mhmm.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.278
Boy, do I have no
opinion about this.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.179
Damn it, Dan.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.514
You have to pick a side.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.682
A side, Roseanne?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.984
Well, my side.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.786
Mom, you can't do that.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.689
Well, what if, when he gets
out, Mark doesn't get a job?

09:15.723 --> 09:16.624
OK?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.158
What if they're
only hiring women

09:18.191 --> 09:19.827
and minorities or
people that aren't

09:19.860 --> 09:22.963
distracted by shiny objects?

09:22.996 --> 09:23.964
This is what's right for us.

09:23.997 --> 09:24.865
No.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.866
I don't think it is.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.000
I think it's a mistake.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.435
And I'm not going to let
you do it with my money.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.303
OK.
Fine, then.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.239
We don't need you or
your stupid money.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.307
From now on, we're going to do
everything all by ourselves.

09:34.341 --> 09:37.044
We're going to pay for our
own food, rent, everything.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.846
Oh well, that really hurts.
Hey.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.313
If you really want to
kill us, why don't you

09:40.347 --> 09:42.149
just go out and buy us a car?

09:42.182 --> 09:45.585
[music playing]

09:50.157 --> 09:51.992
BEVERLY: What a
lovely afternoon.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.927
You know, I never feel
like it's Christmas

09:53.961 --> 09:56.997
till I see "The Nutcracker."

09:57.030 --> 09:59.366
That was the longest
four hours of my life.

09:59.399 --> 10:03.103
I never thought I'd long
for "The Ice Capades."

10:03.136 --> 10:04.204
Well, DJ.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.506
We should really be
getting back to Lanford.

10:06.539 --> 10:10.744
You say goodbye to your
sister while I powder my nose.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.780
Well, this should
be an experience.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.819
DJ, I bought you your
video games yesterday.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.953
Now we're even.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.022
You keep your mouth shut
about David or you die.

10:22.055 --> 10:22.856
OK.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.461
Why is David here anyway?

10:28.495 --> 10:31.564
Because he couldn't
stand your smell either.

10:31.598 --> 10:32.966
No.
Really.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.067
Why is he here?

10:34.101 --> 10:35.869
Because we want
to be together.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.570
Why?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.472
Because we do.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.274
When you have a
girlfriend some day

10:41.308 --> 10:43.410
or a really good blow up
doll, you'll understand.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.918
Do you guys have sex?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.889
That is not for you to know.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.125
I'll tell mom about David.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.259
All right, DJ.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.660
I'm going to level
with you and talk

11:00.694 --> 11:04.364
to you like you're an adult. No,
David and I are not having sex.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.803
They told us in school
if you don't want a baby,

11:09.837 --> 11:12.205
you'd better use birth control.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.106
No.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.107
No.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.877
This conversation
is not happening.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.478
So do you use birth control?

11:18.511 --> 11:19.612
Yes, DJ.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.381
We keep a picture of you
right next to the bed.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.020
You're not ever coming
home again, are you?

11:27.054 --> 11:28.722
You should be so lucky.

11:28.756 --> 11:31.391
It's all different now.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.926
What is?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.161
Everything.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.662
Becky just cares about Mark.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.563
And you're gone.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.135
Well, gee, Deej.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.938
I never thought you'd
actually miss me.

11:44.972 --> 11:48.008
You want me to, like, sit
on your head or something?

11:48.041 --> 11:48.909
No.

11:48.942 --> 11:52.079
Maybe later.

11:52.112 --> 11:56.349
[music playing]

11:56.383 --> 11:57.250
Look.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.685
They marked all their stuff.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.953
Healy cheese.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.154
Healy jelly.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.523
And Healy pudding treats.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.591
Can you believe that?

12:04.624 --> 12:05.692
No.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.162
When did they start
making chocolate mint?

12:09.196 --> 12:10.630
And then she did her
laundry this morning.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.665
Look what I found on top
of the washing machine.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.334
Four Healy quarters.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.668
What do you say to that?

12:15.702 --> 12:17.337
Great.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.140
I want to buy me a pudding.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.943
Dan, you have got to talk Mark
out of going to that school.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.111
I can't do that.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.012
Yes, you can.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.880
You just talk real slow.

12:26.914 --> 12:27.848
No.

12:27.881 --> 12:31.051
I'm busy untangling
these lights.

12:31.084 --> 12:31.952
There.

12:31.985 --> 12:32.953
They're untangled.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.092
Hi, Dad.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.393
Oh, quit sucking up.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.796
He's not going to take a side.

12:42.830 --> 12:43.864
So where have you been?

12:43.897 --> 12:45.165
I got a job at a restaurant.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.299
I started training today.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.174
What?

12:54.207 --> 12:55.608
Buns?

12:55.642 --> 12:57.077
It's my waitress uniform.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.813
You're working
at that Buns place?

12:59.847 --> 13:01.048
Well, I don't
know about you, Dan.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.716
But I have absolutely no
opinion on this at all.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.288
Does your husband
know what you're doing?

13:08.321 --> 13:09.689
- Yes.
- Unbelievable.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.958
This isn't going
to happen, Becky.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.826
I'm old enough to do
what I want and I want

13:12.860 --> 13:13.927
to send my husband to school.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.963
As long as you are
living under my roof,

13:15.996 --> 13:17.764
you are not working there.
- Yeah.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.866
Your dad is right.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.167
And we're going to
give her back the check

13:20.200 --> 13:21.268
so Mark can go to school.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.837
Your dad's an idiot.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.206
Roseanne, you wanted
me to take a side.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.876
My little girl is not going
to work dressed like that.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.743
I am not a little girl.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.545
Why can't either of
you take me seriously?

13:32.579 --> 13:35.849
Because you've got
words on your butt.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.150
Now go change your clothes.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.054
So what?

13:41.088 --> 13:43.156
Now you just want to
give Mark the money?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.424
No, Roseanne.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.893
Believe it or not, I'm not
too thrilled with the guy

13:45.926 --> 13:46.960
right now.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.461
But I've seen what
goes on in that place.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.499
And I don't want my daughter
to have anything to do with it.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.733
You've been inside that place?

13:58.771 --> 13:59.639
Yeah.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.408
I heard the food was good.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.609
You know, brand new.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.277
And they had coupons.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.178
Hey.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.646
Mark's the bad guy here.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.349
I've got work to do.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.252
[music playing]

14:14.587 --> 14:15.855
Can you staple this down here?

14:15.889 --> 14:16.723
Yeah, sure.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.391
Thanks.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.426
Watch it.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.627
Oh, was that your foot?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.029
Sorry.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.030
What are you doing that for?

14:23.063 --> 14:24.764
I did that because
get a damn job.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.066
- Hey, I'm trying here.
- Yeah.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.167
Sure you are.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.568
Why should you when you
could have your wife

14:28.601 --> 14:29.903
go out there and
shake her moneymaker?

14:29.937 --> 14:31.905
I can't believe you
let her work there.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.106
What do you mean "let her?"

14:33.140 --> 14:34.541
Look, I don't make
my wife's decisions.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.377
She's got some rights
in this marriage.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.146
Oh, that is just beautiful.

14:41.748 --> 14:42.615
Yeah, well.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.984
I didn't really buy it, either.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.086
It sounded better
when Becky said it.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.921
And of course she was screaming.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.422
So you're against
her having this job?

14:49.456 --> 14:50.958
Yeah.
I was against it.

14:50.991 --> 14:51.858
I forbid her.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.460
You forbid her?

14:53.493 --> 14:55.828
Oh man, that can't
have been good.

14:55.862 --> 14:56.729
Yeah.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.165
Then she started yelling.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.332
You know, just
because you married

14:59.366 --> 15:00.500
me doesn't mean you own me.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.269
I'm an adult. And--

15:02.302 --> 15:05.038
She'll do what you
damn well pleases.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.840
How'd you know?

15:07.874 --> 15:09.642
I remember everything
about my wedding night.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.914
Is it always going
to be like this?

15:14.948 --> 15:15.815
No.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.217
No.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.221
Because eventually, like water
to a man crossing the desert,

15:21.254 --> 15:24.624
comes sweet, sweet death.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.059
What?

15:26.093 --> 15:27.460
Never mind.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.862
You see, Mark, in
a marriage there's

15:29.896 --> 15:31.731
three things that happen.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.534
First, there's your
win-lose situation.

15:34.567 --> 15:39.106
That's where you get what you
want and she has to sacrifice.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.241
That one is mostly theoretical.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.844
Secondly, there's the
lose-win situation.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.480
That's where she gets what
she wants and you lose out.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.315
Much more common.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.754
Finally, and as long as you'll
be living under this roof,

15:54.787 --> 15:56.456
there's the win-win situation.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.325
That's where Becky
gets what she wants

15:58.358 --> 15:59.559
and Roseanne gets
what she wants.

16:02.695 --> 16:03.997
Where do you want this?

16:04.031 --> 16:05.898
Mark?

16:05.932 --> 16:07.834
Where does Mrs.
Conner want this?

16:07.867 --> 16:11.104
Now you're talking like a man.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.672
So like you've been
doing with this kind

16:12.705 --> 16:13.840
of stuff for 20 years?

16:13.873 --> 16:16.476
I mean, how do you do it?

16:16.509 --> 16:19.879
Well, Mark, after a
while, husbands go to places

16:19.912 --> 16:20.980
they can call their own.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.383
Guy places, like the
garage, the basement.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.284
Roof.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.318
Bingo.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.653
Yeah.

16:26.686 --> 16:30.357
I come up here all time to
fix these damn loose shingles.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.191
Gah.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.196
See now?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.198
This baby will keep
me all next week.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.137
And the beauty part is,
the women send us up here

16:44.171 --> 16:45.805
without knowing we like it.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.839
You know, Dan.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.575
I'm real glad we got
to talk like this.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.609
You know?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.178
I'm really feeling
better about things

16:51.211 --> 16:54.047
and I think I'm
learning something.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.182
See?

16:55.215 --> 16:56.849
Now I bet you thought
I was paying attention.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.922
Tomorrow I'll show
you how to do that.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.325
[music playing]

17:07.660 --> 17:09.196
You're going to give
her the check, Roseanne.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.098
You might as well
admit she beat you.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.999
She did not beat me.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.403
None of my kids has ever beat
me ever since I became a mother.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.837
I am undefeated.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.508
And that is in 10
different weight classes.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.843
How about when Becky
was six and she gave

17:23.876 --> 17:25.011
you the silent
treatment till you

17:25.044 --> 17:26.179
got her the Barbie collection?

17:26.213 --> 17:27.914
I didn't get her
that Barbie collection.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.317
That was Santa Claus.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.219
So what's it taste like?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.120
What?

17:33.153 --> 17:34.020
The beer.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.088
I've been pregnant for so long.

17:35.122 --> 17:38.425
Describe it to me.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.526
You're not missing nothing.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.098
Ooh, that hits the spot.

17:47.867 --> 17:48.668
Becky.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.641
Here you go.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.542
JACKIE: Mhm.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.477
Told you so, Roseanne.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.378
Not from me.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.080
It's from Santa Claus.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.150
Even if we're going to use
it to send Mark to school?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.284
Doesn't matter.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.852
Long as you quit that
horrible job of yours.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.920
I am not quitting the job.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.356
Oh, Becky.
Come on.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.390
You won.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.892
Don't kick your mom
while she's down.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.794
I didn't take the
job to bother Mom.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.695
What?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.397
That's just one of the perks?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.932
Including tips, I
$14 bucks an hour.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.334
$14 bucks an hour.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.602
Wow.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.704
Maybe I should sashay down
there and pull one of them

18:24.737 --> 18:26.473
outfits up over my fat ass.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.112
Come on, Mom.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.447
No.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.083
Hey, if your dignity is for
sale, why shouldn't mine be?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.318
Oh please.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.153
If this family had
any dignity, there

18:40.187 --> 18:41.621
wouldn't be a row of
elves on the front lawn

18:41.654 --> 18:42.622
mooning the Angel Gabriel.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.690
Hey.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.458
We are not degrading
ourselves for tips.

18:45.492 --> 18:50.129
We are degrading ourselves for
the sheer holiday joy of it.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.498
You know, Roseanne,
this money could

18:51.531 --> 18:52.765
help her and Mark
get out of here,

18:52.799 --> 18:53.966
start a life of their own.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.101
Jackie, she
hasn't even thought

18:55.134 --> 18:56.469
this through all the way.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.871
I mean you might be feeling real
good about making big money.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.440
But when you come
home at night, you're

19:00.473 --> 19:02.074
going to feel like trash.

19:02.108 --> 19:06.613
I'll feel like I'm helping
my family get back on its feet.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.581
Well, what if it
doesn't work out that way?

19:08.615 --> 19:10.283
I mean you don't really
know what's going

19:10.317 --> 19:12.585
to happen between you and Mark.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.086
You still don't get it.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.388
Mark is not my boyfriend.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.456
He's my husband.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.257
That means forever.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.396
She's a married
woman, Roseanne.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.203
Becky, come back here.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.939
Now you're doing
the right thing.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.541
What?

19:34.574 --> 19:35.908
Here.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.610
Do you mean it?

19:37.644 --> 19:38.511
Yes.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.146
I do mean it.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.984
I will try to accept your
marriage and your new career

19:45.017 --> 19:48.255
as a prostitute.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.722
Thanks.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.625
[crash]

19:54.193 --> 19:55.262
Every damn year.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.600
They're actually working
pretty hard up there.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.101
Working?

20:02.134 --> 20:03.202
Don't kid yourself.

20:03.236 --> 20:06.373
They like it up there.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.275
Dan finally found
himself a little playmate

20:08.308 --> 20:10.843
that knows all
about double socket

20:10.877 --> 20:15.014
wrench thing or something.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.884
The two of them really
have a lot in common.

20:17.917 --> 20:21.554
You know, it's like the two
of you married the same guy.

20:25.124 --> 20:29.496
[music playing]

20:37.570 --> 20:39.606
Roseanne, your
Christmas decorations

20:39.639 --> 20:41.140
outside are appalling.

20:41.173 --> 20:44.911
The Wise Men are supposed to
be adoring the baby Jesus,

20:44.944 --> 20:46.946
not leering at Mrs. Claus.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.751
Well, of course
they're leering at her.

20:51.784 --> 20:55.087
She's wearing one of
those Buns outfits.

20:55.121 --> 21:01.060
And what on earth are those
shepherds doing to the flock?

21:01.093 --> 21:01.894
Grazing them.

21:04.564 --> 21:08.000
Well, it's time to turn on
our simple white lights.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.407
Mother Harris,
won't you join us?

21:28.154 --> 21:31.524
[switch flipped]

21:31.558 --> 21:33.426
BEVERLY: What is
Santa Claus doing?

21:36.028 --> 21:37.964
ROSEANNE: Well, he's just
telling the whole neighborhood

21:37.997 --> 21:41.801
that Christmas is number one.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.903
Hit the music, Dan.
