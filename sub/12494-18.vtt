00:03.834 --> 00:05.000
Gabe.

00:05.709 --> 00:07.709
Gabe, I have something to tell you.

00:08.667 --> 00:11.000
Tomorrow when I take you to school,

00:11.083 --> 00:14.125
I’m going to park the car and come inside.

00:14.834 --> 00:16.041
Mom, we've been over this.

00:16.125 --> 00:17.333
If you have to use the bathroom,

00:17.417 --> 00:18.917
you can just go at the gas station.

00:20.709 --> 00:22.041
You didn't let me finish.

00:22.125 --> 00:25.417
No. The reason I’m going inside is...

00:25.500 --> 00:26.709
Please don't freak out.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.333
I’m gonna be your school nurse.

00:28.959 --> 00:29.792
What!

00:31.208 --> 00:32.500
No!

00:32.583 --> 00:34.000
You can't...

00:34.250 --> 00:36.000
Why do you hate me?

00:37.208 --> 00:39.000
Well, thank you for not freaking out.

00:40.417 --> 00:42.667
My mom is working at my school?

00:42.792 --> 00:44.792
My life is over.

00:47.041 --> 00:48.667
It's just for a week, okay?

00:48.750 --> 00:51.667
I’m just filling in
while your regular nurse is on vacation.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.458
You couldn't have done this
at a worse time.

00:54.542 --> 00:55.667
Right now at school,

00:55.750 --> 00:57.792
I’m considered cool.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.583
I just--

01:02.667 --> 01:03.667
Okay, you're serious.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.166
Go on.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.041
Well, there's this really
cool kid, Walker,

01:11.125 --> 01:13.667
and he invited me to eat
at his lunch table.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.291
Now, they're all eighth graders,

01:15.375 --> 01:16.667
and I’m only a seventh grader.

01:17.125 --> 01:19.542
Do you how big of an honor that is?

01:20.291 --> 01:22.750
Oh, Gabe. I’m sorry. I, I had no idea.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.208
Why didn't you tell me?

01:24.291 --> 01:26.750
I’ll just turn down
The money we need for groceries.

01:26.834 --> 01:28.166
Thank you.

01:29.625 --> 01:31.750
And then I’ll teach you about sarcasm.

01:32.792 --> 01:36.208
Well, can't you at least
not tell anybody you're my mom?

01:36.250 --> 01:38.625
I mean, maybe you can
use a different name.

01:38.709 --> 01:40.542
Well, I guess I could use my maiden name.

01:40.625 --> 01:42.250
Blankenhooper.

01:43.667 --> 01:44.625
That's good.

01:44.709 --> 01:47.375
And if we see each other at school,
we just keep going.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.041
We don't talk,
we don't look at each other,

01:49.125 --> 01:50.792
we don't interact in any way.

01:50.875 --> 01:52.208
So just like breakfast?

02:53.083 --> 02:54.083
Oh, hey.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.500
I’m Bob. I’m Teddy's dad.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.500
I know. I’m Vonnie.

02:57.583 --> 02:59.000
We've met, like, three times.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.208
Oh, I’m-- I’m sorry.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.583
That's okay. Happens all the time.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.500
Some people just don't
stand out in a crowd.

03:07.583 --> 03:08.792
Or in a group of two.

03:10.792 --> 03:12.959
Well, I won't forget you again.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.792
All right, girls. So what you working on?

03:16.875 --> 03:18.166
Oh, it's a, it's an assignment

03:18.250 --> 03:19.667
for our business and marketing class.

03:19.750 --> 03:21.083
Basically,

03:21.166 --> 03:22.166
come up with a product idea

03:22.250 --> 03:23.500
then pitch it to the group.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.875
Oh! I got, I got a good idea
for a product.

03:25.959 --> 03:27.667
Let me guess, it's the corn chips

03:27.750 --> 03:29.458
that clean your teeth while you eat them?

03:31.583 --> 03:33.375
Did I mention they come
in different flavors?

03:33.417 --> 03:34.834
Bye, Dad.

03:38.041 --> 03:39.917
- Dentitos.
- Bye, Dad.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.041
So, let's talk.

03:45.834 --> 03:46.834
Let's talk ideas.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.125
What's up with your voice?

03:48.208 --> 03:49.750
Oh, it's just a little scratchy.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.959
So, uh, what'd you come up with?

03:52.041 --> 03:53.750
It's your house, you go first.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.834
Okay. Um,

03:54.917 --> 03:58.125
so my idea is pajamas with a fun twist.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.625
Basically, they're footie pajamas

04:00.709 --> 04:01.709
that you decorate yourself.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.333
Introducing...

04:04.792 --> 04:06.625
Graffooties!

04:07.625 --> 04:09.041
Wow.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.083
Man, that is so weird.

04:11.208 --> 04:12.208
What is?

04:12.291 --> 04:14.375
I had the exact same idea.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.667
I mean, I don't have a drawing,

04:17.750 --> 04:19.166
or like a name,

04:19.250 --> 04:22.667
But everything else, exactly the same.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.959
You don't have an idea, do you?

04:26.041 --> 04:28.208
No, ma'am. I do not.

04:29.875 --> 04:31.792
- Vonnie?
- Yep?

04:31.875 --> 04:33.667
What have you been doing all week?

04:33.750 --> 04:36.959
Congratulating myself
for picking you as my partner?

04:46.750 --> 04:48.166
I’m coming.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.000
I said I’m coming.

04:54.917 --> 04:56.375
Mom? What are you doing here?

04:56.417 --> 04:57.709
What am I doing here?

04:57.792 --> 04:59.208
I’m dropping off Charlie and Toby.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.417
I thought Gabe would be
the first kid you got rid of.

05:03.417 --> 05:04.625
PJ, I’m working at Gabe's school.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.959
You're gonna have to watch
the little ones for a few days.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.959
I thought I explained all this
on the phone to emmett.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.208
Didn't he give you the message?

05:10.250 --> 05:11.709
No, he didn't.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.625
I’m gonna call him.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.625
Hello?

05:19.709 --> 05:21.291
Emmett, did you forget
to give me a message?

05:21.375 --> 05:23.375
Your mom's dropping the kids off.

05:24.375 --> 05:25.291
I’ll pick them up at 3:30.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.250
She'll pick them up at 3:30.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.709
Hey, you. Have fun.

05:29.792 --> 05:30.792
Okay.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.792
Is this your house?

05:35.875 --> 05:36.875
Yep.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.166
Were you bad?

05:47.667 --> 05:49.750
Well, hello there, kid I don't know.

05:49.834 --> 05:52.458
I’m nurse Blankenhooper, what's your name?

05:52.542 --> 05:54.375
You promised you wouldn't talk to me.

05:54.458 --> 05:56.667
Well, I just wanted to let you know
that your zipper is down.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.166
Oh! Made you look.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.625
I love middle school.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.750
- Hey, s'up.
- S'up.

06:08.834 --> 06:12.041
I can't believe I have to
run the mile in p.e. today.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.333
I hate the mile.

06:13.417 --> 06:14.834
Yeah, me too.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.208
It totally ruins my hair.

06:22.709 --> 06:25.417
Someone as cool as you
shouldn't have to run the mile.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.041
I mean, your name's Walker, not runner.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.542
Am I right?

06:30.875 --> 06:32.625
Don't worry about me, dude.

06:32.709 --> 06:35.041
I’m not running it.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.125
How are you gonna get out of it?

06:37.208 --> 06:39.625
I've been in eighth grade
for three years now,

06:39.709 --> 06:41.583
I've picked up some things.

06:48.959 --> 06:50.709
Oh, nurse?

06:50.792 --> 06:51.875
Over here.

06:53.667 --> 06:54.583
What's the problem?

06:54.667 --> 06:56.291
Oh, the problem is, I just totally barfed.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.917
Guess I can't go to P.E.

06:58.041 --> 07:01.375
Wow, that looks like
potato soup and fruit punch.

07:02.417 --> 07:03.834
That's what I ate.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.250
Guess they had a fight in my stomach.

07:05.333 --> 07:08.041
Are you sure they were ever
in your stomach?

07:08.125 --> 07:10.834
They seem to have landed
in two separate puddles.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.041
Yeah. Gnarly, huh?

07:14.709 --> 07:16.959
So, guess you'd better write me a note

07:17.041 --> 07:18.041
to get out of P.E.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.917
Yeah, I better.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.542
Okay.

07:22.625 --> 07:25.625
I’m gonna write you an i.d. 10-t form.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.125
Okay.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.834
I want you to wear this All day.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.208
Enjoy P.E.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.083
Hey...

07:51.667 --> 07:52.667
There she is!

07:54.667 --> 07:56.083
There he is.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.166
The guy who can't remember my name.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.333
I remember your name...

08:02.667 --> 08:03.667
Connie.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.250
Nope.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.000
Oh, uh...

08:10.083 --> 08:11.333
Little bit of bad news,

08:11.417 --> 08:12.667
Teddy's got some laryngitis.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.792
Doctor's said she shouldn't
speak for a couple of days.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.291
A couple days?

08:16.375 --> 08:17.875
But what about our presentation?

08:19.458 --> 08:21.166
Oh, me?

08:21.208 --> 08:23.125
No. I can't.

08:25.709 --> 08:26.834
No, but...

08:26.917 --> 08:28.709
I've never given a presentation before.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.542
Wow. Look at this!

08:34.625 --> 08:36.917
It's like she knows
exactly what you're gonna say.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.000
Hey, I bet you don't have a card for me.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.125
And away I go.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.583
Oh, uh, good-bye--

08:51.917 --> 08:53.000
Vonnie!

08:55.667 --> 08:57.583
Can i-- can I keep the card?

09:05.667 --> 09:07.083
Okay, here we go.

09:07.166 --> 09:08.667
Can I have my balloon back now?

09:08.750 --> 09:10.041
Whatever.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.250
- Hi, PJ.
- Hey, Mindy.

09:14.375 --> 09:16.875
I didn't know you were a babysitter.

09:16.959 --> 09:18.959
I’m not. I’m just watching
my brother and sister.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.667
Actually, I’m kind of in a bind.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.166
My nanny just canceled.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.667
Any chance you could watch the twins

09:23.750 --> 09:24.959
for a couple of hours?

09:25.041 --> 09:27.542
Oh... I don't know.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.542
I’ll pay you 15 bucks an hour.

09:29.625 --> 09:30.959
- per kid?
- Sure.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.458
Wow.

09:32.542 --> 09:33.750
Let's see, that's 15 bucks an hour

09:33.834 --> 09:35.041
times two kids

09:35.125 --> 09:36.542
for two hours.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.375
Oh, let's see. Carry the one...

09:39.458 --> 09:40.750
Just say yes.

09:40.834 --> 09:41.834
Yes.

09:48.542 --> 09:49.625
Okay.

09:49.709 --> 09:51.500
So here's my new plan.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.709
Yesterday's fake puke went on the floor,

09:53.792 --> 09:57.208
tomorrow's is gonna go
all over nurse Blankenhooper.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.625
You're gonna puke on her?

09:59.709 --> 10:01.125
Doesn't that seem a little extreme?

10:01.208 --> 10:02.333
Yeah.

10:02.417 --> 10:03.709
We're gonna humiliate her so bad,

10:03.792 --> 10:06.417
she'll never show her face
in this school again.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.917
Well, I do like that part.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.208
Hey, Teddy.

10:17.291 --> 10:18.792
How you feeling?

10:18.875 --> 10:21.208
automated male voice:
Super good and getting better.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
What's all this?

10:24.041 --> 10:27.166
This is how I’m going
to communicate with you today.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.542
a text-to-speech program.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.375
Okay.

10:32.375 --> 10:33.667
Here's the presentation.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.750
Read this out loud.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.542
Hi. I’m Vonnie.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.458
My partner Teddy and I have something

10:43.542 --> 10:46.667
very exciting to share with you today.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.458
Be more excited.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.333
Give me some sizzle with that steak.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.625
Hi! I’m Vonnie.

10:54.709 --> 10:56.125
My partner Teddy and I have something

10:56.208 --> 10:58.041
very exciting to share with you!

10:58.125 --> 11:00.750
Stop. You're killing me.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.250
Hey. Don't take that tone with me.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.125
This is the only tone I have.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.709
I can't do this.

11:08.792 --> 11:09.709
Let's just give up.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.625
What is wrong with you?

11:11.709 --> 11:12.709
Are you a loser?

11:12.792 --> 11:14.083
Hey! I’m not a loser!

11:14.166 --> 11:15.583
You're a loser!

11:15.667 --> 11:16.709
That's it.

11:16.792 --> 11:19.000
Use that passion tomorrow.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.250
You'll nail it, Connie.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.792
Sorry, typo.

11:25.875 --> 11:26.709
Vonnie.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.875
Little lambs babysitting service,

11:33.959 --> 11:35.792
Taking good care of your kids since...

11:35.875 --> 11:37.166
yesterday.

11:38.375 --> 11:39.792
Yes, we are fully licensed.

11:39.875 --> 11:41.250
I've been driving for two years.

11:42.875 --> 11:43.875
Hello?

11:45.166 --> 11:47.500
PJ, this babysitting thing is a gold mine.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.291
I know, dude. We got seven kids.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.750
Seven times 15,

11:50.834 --> 11:51.875
Times two...

11:51.959 --> 11:54.250
Carry the three... Uh.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.625
I’m bored.

11:55.709 --> 11:57.750
Hey, I’m bored too.

11:57.834 --> 11:58.667
Okay.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.333
Uh, how about music time?

12:01.417 --> 12:02.750
- Yeah, music time?
- Yeah.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.625
- Come on, kids. Yay!
- Gather around, little lambs.

12:04.709 --> 12:05.625

Wait.

12:44.667 --> 12:45.792
Verna: What's going on in there?

12:45.875 --> 12:47.125
It's the landlady.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.583
Um, hey, kids.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.250
How about a field trip to bathroom land?

12:50.375 --> 12:51.792
- Yay!
- Woo!

12:51.875 --> 12:53.291
Hey, come on. Silent trip.

12:53.375 --> 12:54.375
Silent trip.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.667
Verna!

13:01.250 --> 13:02.959
Who's making all the noise?

13:03.041 --> 13:04.667
I heard kids.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.250
You got kids in here?

13:06.333 --> 13:07.875
No. No kids.

13:07.959 --> 13:09.250
just us.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.750
Then what's with all the juice boxes?

13:11.166 --> 13:12.333
And the shirts?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.834
We're just two young guys

13:14.917 --> 13:16.834
who like to drink juice from boxes

13:16.917 --> 13:18.625
while wearing matching shirts.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.542
It's relaxing.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.792
Yeah.

13:22.709 --> 13:25.375
Well, I hope you're not running
some kind of babysitting service.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.625
because that is against
building regulations.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.333
Babysitting service?

13:30.417 --> 13:31.583
Oh, that's ridiculous.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.709
No, it's just me and Emmett.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.834
Somebody in your bathroom?

13:36.917 --> 13:37.834
Mm-mm. No. It's--

13:37.917 --> 13:39.500
The toilet's broken.

13:39.583 --> 13:42.875
Yeah, we're having this
delayed flushing issue.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.500
It's very upsetting.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.625
When I do my business,

13:46.709 --> 13:48.583
I like it to be gone immediately.

13:51.709 --> 13:53.709
Well, thanks for stopping by.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.917
I’ll grab my tools and be right back.

13:58.000 --> 13:58.959
Okay.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.083
Dude, what are we gonna do?

14:01.166 --> 14:02.083
We have to hide the kids.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.083
Okay. Um.

14:05.166 --> 14:06.667
Field trip to the ledge.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.166
No.

14:09.750 --> 14:10.750
- No.
- Okay.

14:19.834 --> 14:21.750
- Hey, mom.
- Hey.

14:21.834 --> 14:22.750
Whoa.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.750
What?

14:24.834 --> 14:27.667
Nothing, it's just...

14:27.750 --> 14:28.917
You look kind of tired.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.041
What? That's ridiculous.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.834
I feel great. Took a three hour nap

14:33.917 --> 14:35.333
in the nurse's office today.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.625
Kids kept banging on the door,

14:38.709 --> 14:40.375
I was out.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.917
I think you should take tomorrow off.

14:45.000 --> 14:45.917
Why?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.625
Well, you've heard of

14:47.709 --> 14:49.625
bring your kid to work day?

14:49.709 --> 14:53.583
well, tomorrow's
keep your mom at home day.

14:54.709 --> 14:56.625
Come on, Gabe. You're better than that.

14:56.709 --> 14:58.083
Oh, just stay home. I’m desperate.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.875
What is going on?

15:02.959 --> 15:05.375
well, I’m going through
the worst dilemma of my life.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.709
It's you versus being cool,

15:06.792 --> 15:10.458
and I can't believe I’m picking you.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.083
Okay, Gabe.

15:15.166 --> 15:17.083
What's going on?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.792
Well, you didn't hear this from me,

15:19.875 --> 15:22.834
but there's a good chance
you're getting puked on tomorrow

15:22.917 --> 15:23.834
By Walker.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.834
I’m getting puked on
and you struggled to tell me?

15:31.542 --> 15:32.959
This kid throws really cool parties.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.166
I gave birth to you!

15:34.250 --> 15:36.333
That was a long time ago!

15:38.750 --> 15:41.959
Look, can you please just not
come to school tomorrow?

15:42.041 --> 15:44.542
Okay. Okay, so I don't go in tomorrow.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.542
What about Thursday and Friday?

15:47.625 --> 15:48.750
When does it end?

15:48.834 --> 15:49.959
Saturday.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.792
- Easy. Easy.
- Okay.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.500
Perfect.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.000
It's open.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.208
Here to fix the toilet.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.583
Bathroom's right over there.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.792
Was that there before?

16:12.875 --> 16:14.875
Was what there before?

16:16.458 --> 16:18.792
The giant pile of clothes.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.583
Laundry day.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.083
Yeah. You drink as much juice as we do,

16:25.166 --> 16:27.792
you're gonna have a lot of laundry.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.667
Well, shouldn't you
get started with your wash?

16:31.542 --> 16:32.667
Uh...

16:32.750 --> 16:34.083
Yes.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.458
We should.

16:35.542 --> 16:36.583
Emmett.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.041
Come on. Let's get started.

16:42.250 --> 16:43.834
Aah aah aah!

Turns out laryngitis Is contagious.

17:09.792 --> 17:11.333
Oh, no.

17:11.417 --> 17:13.417
Our presentation is in one hour.

17:15.709 --> 17:17.792
What are we going to do?

17:19.208 --> 17:21.333
Oh, hey girls. What's up?

17:21.417 --> 17:22.750
I have an idea.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.750
I have the same idea.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.041
You go first.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.375

17:41.458 --> 17:42.750
to share with you today.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.166
We take you to a sleepover

17:46.250 --> 17:50.333

17:52.625 --> 17:53.875
Ding dong.

17:53.959 --> 17:57.667
Hey, girl! Thanks for the sleepover.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.834
No prob. That's what besties do.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.417
I just wish there was some way

18:04.500 --> 18:06.834
we could wake up this slumber party.

19:18.834 --> 19:20.542
Yeah. I distract her

19:20.625 --> 19:22.542
while you take a big swig
of mushroom soup.

19:22.625 --> 19:23.625
And then boom.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.417
I get her right in the face.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.917
Oh, nurse?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.500
I don't feel so good.

19:31.792 --> 19:33.000
Oh, no. What's wrong?

19:33.083 --> 19:34.792
Oh, I feel nauseous.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.166
Oh.

19:36.667 --> 19:37.583
Nurse!

19:37.667 --> 19:39.208
Look over there. Something medical

19:39.250 --> 19:40.250
looks like it's happening.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.792
Hey, don't distract me, kid.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.000
Can't you see that this boy here
is very ill?

19:44.083 --> 19:45.583
Fortunately,

19:45.667 --> 19:47.083
I've come prepared.

19:51.709 --> 19:52.917
What's that?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.125
Your anti-nausea shot.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.667
Uh... I don't need it.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.792
Actually, I’m feeling
a whole lot better now.

19:59.875 --> 20:00.792
Oh, no.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.750
That means the puke is eating your brain.

20:04.208 --> 20:05.500
I’m gonna have to give you this shot

20:05.583 --> 20:06.500
right in your head.

20:06.583 --> 20:07.667
In my head?

20:07.750 --> 20:08.750
In your head.

20:10.458 --> 20:11.750
First, of course,

20:11.834 --> 20:13.583
I’m gonna have to shave your hair.

20:14.625 --> 20:15.542
What?

20:15.625 --> 20:16.917
No.

20:26.625 --> 20:27.834
Mmm!

20:27.917 --> 20:29.667
Spaghetti.

20:36.208 --> 20:37.417
Okay.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.709
All right, Charlie.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.834
Well, Teddy still can't talk,

20:40.917 --> 20:44.125
so Dad's gonna fill in
for the video diary.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.917
So, uh...

20:46.000 --> 20:47.125
Good luck, Charlie.

20:48.625 --> 20:49.542
What?

20:49.625 --> 20:50.959
I thought that was pretty good.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.125
We-- All right.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.500
We-- Okay.

20:53.583 --> 20:58.667
Uh, Charlie, I guess
I’m supposed to say more.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.375
All right, well--

21:00.458 --> 21:02.250
Okay, so this week,

21:02.375 --> 21:04.875
Teddy learned a very valuable lesson

21:04.959 --> 21:08.083
about um...

21:08.166 --> 21:11.083
being yourself?

21:11.166 --> 21:13.083
Telling the truth?

21:13.166 --> 21:14.583
Going for it?

21:14.667 --> 21:16.667
Teamwork?

21:16.750 --> 21:18.166
Teamwork!

21:18.250 --> 21:20.250
Teamwork.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.083
Because-- oh oh oh oh!

21:22.166 --> 21:25.083
Because if you don't work as a team,

21:25.166 --> 21:26.750
then the team don't work.

21:27.750 --> 21:28.875
Huh? How about that.

21:28.959 --> 21:30.583
That-- come on, that's pretty good.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.750
I got a bunch of that.

21:41.709 --> 21:43.500
automated male voice: Good luck, Charlie.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.625
What am I gonna do?

21:52.709 --> 21:53.709
Ever since the presentation,

21:53.792 --> 21:55.417
My voice has been like this.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.875
You think you got problems?

21:59.959 --> 22:02.583
I got kicked off
my bowling team because of this.

22:07.083 --> 22:08.291
Hey, guys.

22:10.583 --> 22:12.709
Something really strange
is going on around here.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.792
Tell me about it.

22:15.875 --> 22:18.083
I know at this age
my voice is supposed to change,

22:18.166 --> 22:19.834
But not into my mom's!

22:24.333 --> 22:25.375
What are you doing here?

22:25.458 --> 22:26.625
I’m just here

22:26.750 --> 22:27.834
to fix the toilet.
