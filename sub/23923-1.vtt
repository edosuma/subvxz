"Mike Tyson Mysteries"...

00:05.608 --> 00:06.875
Oh... ****

00:11.421 --> 00:13.284
Congratulations, Deezy,

00:13.372 --> 00:18.350
you are now an official member
of the Mike Tyson Mystery Team.

00:18.438 --> 00:20.140
I-I-I didn't
want to kill someone.

00:20.227 --> 00:21.821
We all had to kill someone
to join the team.

00:21.908 --> 00:24.321
We're a special,
secret government strike team.

00:24.409 --> 00:28.352
Also known as the Mike Tyson Special
Secret Government Strike Team.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.290

Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Time to Fly"</font>

00:31.009 --> 00:32.634
I just...
I just...

00:32.729 --> 00:34.299
I just can't have
killed someone.

00:34.387 --> 00:35.801
I took another person's life?

00:35.889 --> 00:37.357
I can't live with that burden!

00:37.849 --> 00:39.287
- No!
- Oh my God!

00:41.939 --> 00:43.526
What... what happened?

00:43.733 --> 00:45.514
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.449
You tried to kill yourself.

00:47.536 --> 00:48.714
Kill himself?

00:48.802 --> 00:50.456
He's holding a loaded gun,

00:50.544 --> 00:53.800
and instead he jumped out of
the window of a two-story house.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.970
It was nothing
but attention seeking.

00:56.058 --> 00:57.745
He's got a broken foot.

00:57.942 --> 01:02.307
Of course, they'll keep him
overnight for "observation".

01:02.398 --> 01:07.316
And who pays for that?
John Q. Taxpayer, that's who.

01:07.404 --> 01:09.386
This is why
I voted for Trump!

01:09.474 --> 01:12.323
I'm a Trump man!
Always have been.

01:12.411 --> 01:14.126
Give 'em hell, Trump.

01:14.214 --> 01:15.962
Drain that swamp!

01:16.050 --> 01:19.948
Build that wall!
Lock her up!

01:20.246 --> 01:22.929
So what is this secret government
strike team you got me on?

01:23.017 --> 01:25.866
What do we do? Do you have to
keep killing people? I can't!

01:25.954 --> 01:27.769
You can't make me.
Oh, God!

01:27.901 --> 01:29.768
Oh, God! Oh, God,
I killed someone!

01:29.856 --> 01:31.237
Blood on my hands, Lord!

01:31.325 --> 01:32.573
- Dad.
- What?

01:32.661 --> 01:34.261
You have to tell him.

01:34.349 --> 01:36.197
Tell me what?
That I'm off the team?

01:36.288 --> 01:38.437
No, I just got on this team.
I can kill.

01:38.525 --> 01:40.287
Who do you want me to kill?
I can kill anyone.

01:40.375 --> 01:41.783
I'll kill that
old man to prove it.

01:41.871 --> 01:43.686
- Prove my loyalty.
- Deezy, stop.

01:43.774 --> 01:47.457
Michael, tell him!
I will not be party to this any longer.

01:47.591 --> 01:50.874
Okay, fine. Deezy, I have
a confession to make.

01:50.962 --> 01:54.179
There's no Mike Tyson Secret Government...
Uh... What'd I call it?

01:54.267 --> 01:56.048
Secret Government Strike Team.

01:56.164 --> 01:58.113
Yeah, there's
no such thing as that.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.588
- I made it up.
- What?

01:59.676 --> 02:01.153
Yeah, here's the truth
of it, Deezy.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.604
You're a real shitty agent.

02:02.692 --> 02:05.167
And I wanted to fire you
for a long time.

02:05.308 --> 02:08.056
But my problem is that
I'm non-confrontational.

02:08.193 --> 02:11.464
That was my problem in boxing,
that's my problem in life.

02:11.552 --> 02:14.956
So instead of just telling you I would
no longer like you to be my agent,

02:15.044 --> 02:17.136
- we decided...
- Michael.

02:17.418 --> 02:20.042
I decided
to trick you into thinking,

02:20.130 --> 02:22.378
that you are on a secret
government team

02:22.466 --> 02:24.659
and so instead
of being my agent,

02:24.747 --> 02:28.197
I would send you to like, um,
Pakistan and just maybe, um...

02:28.434 --> 02:29.737
Never hear from you again.

02:29.825 --> 02:31.288
But what about
that guy I shot and killed?

02:31.375 --> 02:32.624
That dude that
looked just like me?

02:32.711 --> 02:34.813
You mean Terry,
our pool man?

02:34.901 --> 02:36.407
Terry, come on in.

02:36.529 --> 02:38.649
Hi, everyone. Hi, Deezy.

02:38.737 --> 02:40.055
Wait, I shot you.

02:40.143 --> 02:41.758
I was wearing
a bulletproof vest.

02:41.846 --> 02:43.790
But, how do you look
exactly like me?

02:43.878 --> 02:45.102
Is that some kind of a mask?

02:45.190 --> 02:49.118
No. I really did have total
facial reconstructive surgery.

02:49.258 --> 02:51.874
I've undergone over
a thousand skin grafts.

02:51.962 --> 02:53.443
I'd do anything for the champ.

02:53.531 --> 02:55.063
And in return he promised me

02:55.151 --> 02:56.314
that I'd be made a
member of

02:56.402 --> 02:58.955
the Mike Tyson Secret
Government Strike Team.

02:59.143 --> 03:01.391
I leave for Pakistan
first thing in the morning.

03:01.486 --> 03:04.251
- Bon voyage, Terry.
- Good day, everyone.

03:06.404 --> 03:08.919
He never got the chlorine
level right in the pool,

03:09.045 --> 03:10.825
but I didn't have
the heart to let him go.

03:10.913 --> 03:12.128
That's my problem.

03:12.216 --> 03:14.360
Okay, team, time to fly.

03:14.570 --> 03:17.180
That's my new catchphrase
when we're going somewhere.

03:17.268 --> 03:18.657
"Time to fly."

03:18.745 --> 03:21.086
Deezy, why don't you see about
copyrighting that ****.

03:21.174 --> 03:23.547
So wait, what does that mean, Mike?
Am I still your agent?

03:24.393 --> 03:28.343
<i>Say no, just say no.
Say, "Deezy, you're fired."</i>

03:28.454 --> 03:30.103
Of course,
you're still my agent.

03:30.308 --> 03:31.602
<i>Mother...</i> ****

03:31.690 --> 03:33.048
And can I still stay
at your house?

03:33.135 --> 03:34.946
<i> No way, Jose.</i>

03:35.034 --> 03:37.649
My <i> casa es su casa,</i> Jose.

03:37.737 --> 03:40.016
<i>Oh, no, what is my problem?</i>

03:42.413 --> 03:44.528
Hmm... Does that
taste good, Pigeon?

03:44.616 --> 03:47.061
Oh, does this bird seed
taste good?

03:47.149 --> 03:48.602
- Is that your question, Marquess?
- Okay.

03:48.689 --> 03:50.971
- Does this bird seed taste good?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:51.059 --> 03:54.399
No, it doesn't taste good,
you witless gadfly.

03:54.487 --> 03:58.437
I want to eat what you're eating,
but I can't because it gives me diarrhea.

03:58.524 --> 04:00.836
This is the only thing
that doesn't give me diarrhea.

04:00.924 --> 04:03.308
My asshole is so raw,

04:03.396 --> 04:07.579
it's just red and raw from
all the **** damn diarrhea.

04:07.666 --> 04:10.082
Okay, that... That's
not really breakfast talk.

04:10.169 --> 04:12.532
Oh! Should we
talk about my piss?

04:12.620 --> 04:15.136
How it's dark, almost orange.

04:15.243 --> 04:17.224
Because I'm so dehydrated

04:17.312 --> 04:19.793
on account of
how much diarrhea I have,

04:19.882 --> 04:21.952
while I'm not eating
bird seed.

04:22.081 --> 04:25.683
This delicious bird seed.
Go **** yourself!

04:26.595 --> 04:29.411
Why do you engage with him?

04:29.499 --> 04:31.266
Learn your lesson, Marquess.

04:31.354 --> 04:35.440
It's better to let someone walk away
from you than walk all over you.

04:35.528 --> 04:38.211
When people treat you like
they don't care, believe them.

04:38.299 --> 04:40.485
One of the most courageous
decisions you'll ever make

04:40.573 --> 04:44.163
is to finally let go
of what is hurting your heart.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.685
My God! Are you still talking?

04:46.772 --> 04:48.906
Ah, to hell with it.
Give me a bite of that.

04:50.002 --> 04:53.158
Ooh, that is good.
Oh hoh!

04:53.359 --> 04:54.907
It's gonna burn coming out,

04:54.995 --> 04:57.626
but you can't say it's not good going in.

04:57.768 --> 04:59.849
Real nice hot cakes, Mike.

04:59.937 --> 05:01.652
Thank you
for saying so, Pigeon.

05:01.740 --> 05:04.086
At least someone
in this house has manners.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.938
Morning, Deezy.
You sleep well?

05:06.058 --> 05:08.352
You're covered in bird
****, so probably not.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.456
Just feeling blessed to have
a roof over my head, Mike.

05:10.543 --> 05:11.821
Got a mystery
here for you guys.

05:11.909 --> 05:13.899
Thanks, Deezy. Here, Yung,
why don't you read it?

05:13.987 --> 05:15.836
You haven't spoken
in quite some time.

05:15.973 --> 05:17.938
Oh, hmm, all right.

05:18.104 --> 05:19.518
"Dear Mike Tyson
Mystery Team..."

05:19.606 --> 05:21.391
No, it's too boring
when you read it.

05:21.486 --> 05:24.135
Marquess, you read it.
You have that flamboyant style.

05:24.301 --> 05:26.550
Uh... Thank you?

05:26.692 --> 05:28.207
- "Dear Mike Tyson Mystery Team..."
- Hmm...

05:28.294 --> 05:30.219
maybe it's Pigeon
that's the flamboyant one.

05:30.307 --> 05:31.654
You read it, Pigeon.

05:31.776 --> 05:33.391
"Dear Mike Tyson
Mystery Team..."

05:33.479 --> 05:35.527
Damn, maybe
I'm the flamboyant one.

05:35.615 --> 05:37.831
"Dear Mike Tyson Mystery Team,

05:37.919 --> 05:43.004
no one believes me, but my husband
was abducted by aliens, please help.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.743
Megan Von Breyer."

05:44.934 --> 05:46.783
Yeah, I'm the flamboyant one.

05:46.909 --> 05:49.907
All right, team, time to fly.

05:49.995 --> 05:52.407
Hey, Deezy, what's the status
on that "Time to Fly"?

05:52.495 --> 05:54.076
You get that shit copyrighted?

05:54.164 --> 05:56.179
We should be making a lot
of money off that shit.

05:56.267 --> 05:58.616
I'm one step ahead of you
and two steps back, Mike.

05:58.804 --> 06:01.477
Ordered 10,000 ball caps with
"Time to Fly" on the front.

06:01.565 --> 06:02.946
We have a website
up and running,

06:03.034 --> 06:04.983
and we're already being
sued by United Airlines.

06:05.116 --> 06:06.299
No, Southwest.

06:06.387 --> 06:07.970
No, American Airlines.

06:08.057 --> 06:10.260
Oh, maybe it was Air France.
It's some airline,

06:10.348 --> 06:11.415
I gotta check my notes.

06:11.502 --> 06:12.961
I think I left them
in the coop.

06:16.608 --> 06:17.656
Can I help you?

06:17.744 --> 06:20.329
Oh, hello, we're the
Mike Tyson Mystery Team.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.899
- We got your note about the aliens.
- Huh!

06:23.158 --> 06:25.963
That little bitch.
Abducted by aliens?

06:26.051 --> 06:28.066
- She murdered my father.
- Oh!

06:28.154 --> 06:30.469
- So you're not Megan Von Breyer?
- No.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.239
I'm Emily Von Breyer.

06:32.395 --> 06:34.243
Carlton Von Breyer's daughter.

06:34.331 --> 06:36.401
And I was just asked to leave

06:36.489 --> 06:38.215
by the grieving widow.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.588
Oh, sorry about that.

06:40.676 --> 06:44.541
I had pancakes for breakfast.

06:45.884 --> 06:47.472
Ugh, gross.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.174
She just married him
for his money.

06:49.262 --> 06:51.244
Now, now, Yung,
you don't know that.

06:51.332 --> 06:54.682
Why, perhaps he was
a world-class cunnilingust.

06:54.827 --> 06:57.310
A magnificent **** eater.

06:57.398 --> 06:59.246
A proper **** muncher.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.861
- Just stop.
- Oh, there she is, outside.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.401
- Surprise!
- Ah!

07:05.489 --> 07:08.103
- Oh!
- Sorry, I sometimes shout, "Surprise!"

07:08.191 --> 07:10.274
when I really mean
to whisper, "Hello."

07:12.850 --> 07:14.531
You should have let me fall.

07:14.657 --> 07:16.306
My life is already over.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.309
Everyone thinks
I murdered Carlton.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.613
Why? Because
he was 84 and I'm 23.

07:21.776 --> 07:25.947
Because he had just changed his will so
that I would be the sole beneficiary.

07:26.035 --> 07:29.221
- Uh, yeah.
- It was his anniversary gift to me.

07:29.309 --> 07:32.692
He told me right here,
right before I gave him his gift.

07:32.780 --> 07:34.095
A shove off the cliff?

07:34.183 --> 07:35.831
You're just like
the rest of 'em.

07:35.919 --> 07:38.067
No, I got him a great gift.

07:38.155 --> 07:39.463
I got him a star.

07:39.551 --> 07:40.594
What?

07:40.682 --> 07:42.666
Online,
you can name a star after someone.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.135
And you get
a little certificate

07:44.223 --> 07:46.682
that tells you
exactly where the star is.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.485
The Carlton Star.

07:48.672 --> 07:51.121
It's up there... Somewhere.

07:52.566 --> 07:54.752
- And so is he.
- Oh, my God.

07:54.918 --> 07:57.701
That is a great gift.
You know what else is a great gift?

07:57.789 --> 07:59.096
A lottery ticket.

07:59.184 --> 08:02.432
It seems like something,
but it's really nothing. And it's cheap.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.478
So, after you
gave him this "star",

08:05.566 --> 08:07.025
is that when the aliens

08:07.113 --> 08:09.395
conveniently showed up
to take him off your hands?

08:09.616 --> 08:11.853
If I pushed Carlton
off this cliff,

08:11.941 --> 08:13.885
how come the police
didn't find a body?

08:13.973 --> 08:15.728
Because there is no body.

08:15.876 --> 08:19.426
Because aliens took him.
They took him into space.

08:19.514 --> 08:22.864
Please, you're my only hope
to clear my name.

08:23.029 --> 08:26.166
Find Carlton.
Bring him back to me.

08:27.614 --> 08:30.163
Okay, seems pretty clear
what we have to do.

08:30.251 --> 08:33.433
Simply go to space,
simply find these aliens,

08:33.522 --> 08:35.270
simply negotiate with them

08:35.357 --> 08:38.375
over the release of Carlton
and simply return to Earth.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.344
We may need to get
a heat shield.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.635
I think when you return to
Earth you need a heat shield

08:42.724 --> 08:44.272
or you burn up
in the atmosphere.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.975
But the rest is pretty
straightforward.

08:46.091 --> 08:48.507
Dad, it's obvious
she murdered him.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.610
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking, too.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.768
And now we don't need that heat shield.
Good job, Yung.

08:55.778 --> 08:58.961
There has to be some evidence
down there that the police missed.

08:59.056 --> 09:00.744
Ooh, Yung is on a roll.

09:00.832 --> 09:04.189
You didn't talk much at the beginning,
but now, boy, you're talking a lot.

09:04.363 --> 09:05.471
Go Yung!

09:05.559 --> 09:07.739
Marquess, Pigeon,
what are you guys doing, huh?

09:07.827 --> 09:10.242
You're only good as your
last line of the dialogue.

09:10.353 --> 09:13.185
Well, how on Earth
would we get down there?

09:13.272 --> 09:15.150
Ooh, Marquess,
getting it in there.

09:15.247 --> 09:17.439
Come on, Pigeon,
what do you got to say?

09:18.817 --> 09:19.817
Whoa!

09:19.919 --> 09:22.301
Pigeon with the unexpected
physical move.

09:22.389 --> 09:24.400
Now we're working like a team.

09:24.660 --> 09:27.900
Ah! Pigeon, you asshole!

09:27.988 --> 09:29.836
I thought you could fly.

09:30.020 --> 09:33.260
- Aren't you an angel?
- I'm a ghost!

09:33.416 --> 09:37.416
But, isn't your catchphrase,
"Time to fly"?

09:37.504 --> 09:40.553
That is
Michael's catchphrase!

09:40.641 --> 09:42.723
Oh, you know what,

09:42.913 --> 09:44.549
I think you're right.

09:46.431 --> 09:47.453
Oh, my!

09:47.541 --> 09:49.549
His wheelchair! Look!

09:49.637 --> 09:51.218
It's Carlton's wheelchair!

09:51.529 --> 09:53.578
So she did push
him off the cliff.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.381
And now we have our evidence.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.252
We also have something
for me to use on long walks,

09:58.340 --> 10:00.541
just in case
my legs get tired.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.582
I didn't do it! I swear!

10:02.670 --> 10:05.947
The wheelchair fell into the ocean
when the aliens beamed him up.

10:09.427 --> 10:12.135
I'm actually glad
she's as young as she is.

10:12.223 --> 10:15.674
It'll be more time that
she gets to rot in prison.

10:18.469 --> 10:21.418
What are your intentions with our
star which you claim is your own?

10:21.583 --> 10:25.200
I have no intentions.
It was just a gift from my wife Megan.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.752
It was meant to be romantic.

10:26.847 --> 10:30.205
She's the most loving,
kindhearted woman I've ever known.

10:30.293 --> 10:34.077
So you have no plans on enforcing
this document and enslaving us?

10:34.173 --> 10:37.650
Of course not. I just want
to go home to my wife.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.205
Then we shall release you.

10:39.293 --> 10:40.433
Oh!

10:43.231 --> 10:46.214
- Hmm...
- We forgot to give him a heat shield.

10:46.923 --> 10:48.459
Time to fly.

10:49.675 --> 10:52.699
