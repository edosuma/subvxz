WEBVTT

00:02.414 --> 00:04.554
Father, you need to help me.

00:04.689 --> 00:07.104
What is your plight?

00:07.778 --> 00:10.631
I feel darkness all around me

00:11.012 --> 00:12.564
that compells me to do things.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.083
What sorts of things?

00:15.554 --> 00:17.300
Shameful things, please

00:18.460 --> 00:19.481
to make me say

00:19.550 --> 00:21.905
But you must acknowledge you sin

00:22.013 --> 00:24.208
before you can be forgiven
for them

00:24.593 --> 00:26.306
I'm so weak...

00:28.553 --> 00:31.204
I allow the darkness inside me

00:31.353 --> 00:33.627
And I'm so afraid

00:33.807 --> 00:37.212
You're a child of God. He will
not let harm come to you

00:39.380 --> 00:42.195
I'm not afraid for me...

00:43.454 --> 00:45.649
I'm afraid for you

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:54.246 --> 00:57.506
I'm his flesh. I'll do

01:54.877 --> 01:57.627
This deed of trust... between Wickbold
EA and Arthur Conan Doyle With

01:57.671 --> 02:01.049
the offer to Purchase No. 46 Forbes Street,
London, The home of Charles Doyle.

02:28.704 --> 02:31.110
Hey,did you find out anything more
about night ou panic instan

02:31.186 --> 02:33.076
This is not the place

02:34.770 --> 02:37.248
Have you requested coroner's
report? Could be nothing!

02:37.275 --> 02:39.502
Dr. Doyle, have you discovered
anything?

02:39.572 --> 02:42.254
The victm's facial distortion is
the symptom of

02:42.283 --> 02:44.938
stress-provoked ventricular
fibrillation.

02:45.050 --> 02:47.188
which flooded her heart
with adrenaline

02:47.639 --> 02:49.615
She was frightened to death.

02:49.716 --> 02:51.324
You look worse than usual...

02:51.486 --> 02:53.575
Children were particularly
rambunctious last night

02:53.675 --> 02:57.194
Witnesses reported this woman
exhibited the strength of several men

02:57.368 --> 02:58.307
A drowning

02:58.401 --> 03:00.848
can make people do
extraordinary things.

03:00.995 --> 03:03.486
Like the Michigan's stunt, for example

03:03.590 --> 03:04.993
The whole thing frozen over

03:05.078 --> 03:07.518
I dove in this hole but
I can't find my way back

03:07.705 --> 03:09.338
I was drowning

03:09.925 --> 03:12.352
I'd punched out of 18 inches of ice

03:12.512 --> 03:15.925
The police claimed that she was
possessed by some sort of demon

03:16.091 --> 03:18.481
The only thing that possessed
her was a sick xxxxx.

03:18.674 --> 03:20.242
You don't believe in evil?

03:20.362 --> 03:22.430
Human evil, yes.

03:22.683 --> 03:25.020
Do'nt tell me you think there's
an actual devil out there

03:25.074 --> 03:26.925
somewhere walking around
with horns and pitchforks.

03:27.043 --> 03:29.115
I believe in God, why
shouldn't I believe in Lucifer?

03:29.175 --> 03:32.085
Just because you believe in one fairy
tale doesn't mean you believe in all...

03:32.159 --> 03:33.917
It's an obsession.
It's insanity

03:33.975 --> 03:35.311
For being possessed

03:35.384 --> 03:37.218
may have looked insane

03:37.343 --> 03:38.281
Look at this.

03:38.383 --> 03:40.679
It's some sort of
skin sensitiveness

03:40.723 --> 03:44.109
urticaria, although I've never
seen in such configuration

03:44.259 --> 03:45.899
She's wearing a nice ring

03:46.000 --> 03:47.460
The clothes... It seems...

03:47.538 --> 03:49.086
institutional

03:49.264 --> 03:50.819
B-R-H

03:50.925 --> 03:52.247
Bethlem Royal Hospital

03:52.305 --> 03:53.972
Only known as Bedlam.

03:54.079 --> 03:56.710
It's the clothes they issue the
patients who have been released

03:56.788 --> 03:59.329
So, she's just got out of
the loony bin...

04:00.270 --> 04:02.501
Then equals what? Loony?

04:03.134 --> 04:05.856
Anyone behaving at all out of
the ordinary can be commited

04:06.355 --> 04:08.918
champions to a frozen lake,
for instance

04:16.677 --> 04:20.362
What an atrocity is commited
in this snake berth.

04:20.879 --> 04:22.656
Bedlam or wakes.

04:29.911 --> 04:32.024
Clearly Molly shouldn't never
have been released.

04:32.108 --> 04:35.197
especially since with
a history of delusions

04:36.177 --> 04:37.832
I never went to medical schools...

04:37.848 --> 04:39.721
but didn't they just say 'I'm right and
you're wrong'?

04:39.783 --> 04:41.887
We necessarily rule out
possessions

04:42.055 --> 04:43.824
You've all tried for her realease?

04:43.920 --> 04:46.249
No, no, that's was Dr. Randall.

04:46.521 --> 04:48.983
He harbour a hope for
curing fear itself

04:49.093 --> 04:51.230
to abstract somatis...
- But a..

04:51.634 --> 04:54.187
He's had glimmer of promises

04:54.399 --> 04:57.103
A chase into some severe issues
made that happened again.

04:57.159 --> 04:58.826
Well, we only behave
his words

04:58.909 --> 05:01.396
Worth to show I'd take
a most substantive approach

05:01.427 --> 05:02.625
than Dr. Randall.

05:02.762 --> 05:05.648
Electroshock, lobotomies have
proved as effective

05:05.737 --> 05:08.250
Time people to house
plans

05:08.401 --> 05:09.331
Surely is.

05:09.399 --> 05:12.254
As a doctor you understands
the brain is an organ...

05:12.399 --> 05:15.136
like any other.
-Like any other?

05:16.855 --> 05:19.365
I'd hate to hear that kidneys
are there for symphony.

05:36.538 --> 05:38.918
Many patients here live in
their own filthy

05:39.204 --> 05:42.882
Which patriot confess chill to view
them like animals in the zoo?

05:43.067 --> 05:45.523
I brought humanity to
Bethlam

05:45.704 --> 05:47.201
Arthur Conan Doyle.

05:47.262 --> 05:49.096
We meet at last.

05:49.636 --> 05:51.432
My name is Hendridge

05:51.768 --> 05:52.927
Sherlock Holmes.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.167
We currently have three
patients

05:56.242 --> 05:57.358
with the same delusion

05:57.430 --> 05:59.891
In the matter of logic
two of us must be wrong

05:59.975 --> 06:01.129
At least.

06:01.374 --> 06:03.057
But you have a lot of fans in here

06:03.233 --> 06:05.141
I'm honored you like
the character

06:05.208 --> 06:05.956
Actually...

06:06.225 --> 06:09.617
I've noted 87 occasions for
you to betray me inaccurately

06:09.850 --> 06:12.798
I plan to get proper legal
action to stop this slime.

06:12.951 --> 06:14.788
I'll alert my solicitor

06:14.870 --> 06:17.105
That's right. Mock the lunatic.

06:17.605 --> 06:19.401
You didn't make me.

06:19.608 --> 06:21.807
I... made.... you!

06:22.930 --> 06:24.173
-

06:24.245 --> 06:26.321
His name was Wilson.

06:27.165 --> 06:30.187
I image you have several patients
claiming to be possessed...

06:30.314 --> 06:32.747
Yes, it's now too common illusion.

06:32.836 --> 06:36.091
Have you ever had a case you thought
could be actually possession?

06:36.976 --> 06:37.476
No.

06:38.278 --> 06:39.423
Well... ah...

06:39.985 --> 06:42.812
We do have one patient
who has given me pos?

06:42.915 --> 06:45.774
A defrocked priest, named
Nathaniel Ferdistat?

06:45.793 --> 06:48.437
It stepped the immagination of several
other patients including Molly

06:48.497 --> 06:49.947
How many others?

06:50.004 --> 06:51.646
Have they been released?

06:51.810 --> 06:52.951
I'm not sure.

06:53.045 --> 06:54.072
But there is no reason to...

06:54.101 --> 06:56.173
They're may be in danger.
We need to see your records.

06:56.288 --> 06:58.759
No, no, no. You know
I can't do that.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.940
The Lord Chief Justice
owes me a favour

07:01.107 --> 07:02.793
I'll be back very soon.

07:07.954 --> 07:11.165
Call boy to let him finish a lunch.
I need a court order.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.951
Did you tell him who's asking?

07:24.744 --> 07:26.423
Father, let's play some football

07:26.470 --> 07:27.170
I'm working.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.860
You don't look like
you're working...

07:30.105 --> 07:33.363
I'm thinking. For a writer
thinking is working.

07:33.774 --> 07:35.466
You're not thinking,
you're stomping.

07:35.483 --> 07:37.644
Kingsley! Out!

07:38.276 --> 07:39.761
Stop your whining.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.947
Stop your whining, Arthur!

07:48.992 --> 07:51.148
The world hates your whinge.

07:54.685 --> 07:56.615
Omni immundus spiritus

07:56.696 --> 07:58.620
Omni satanical potestas

07:59.110 --> 08:01.017
No, I can curtail ye all

08:02.127 --> 08:04.214
I cast out the demon in you.

08:04.262 --> 08:05.228
Go to hell with you!

08:05.255 --> 08:07.274
In name of our lord
-You people mads...

08:07.331 --> 08:10.084
disgust, your mental pathetic
witling

08:10.562 --> 08:12.769
and the holy water

08:13.173 --> 08:14.942
We use this purified water

08:15.211 --> 08:18.481
[.....] - to banish the creature
within you

08:18.928 --> 08:19.372
Damn you!

08:19.423 --> 08:21.264
To lever you on old..

08:21.309 --> 08:22.555
that is unpleasant

08:22.622 --> 08:23.521
Shut up!

08:25.269 --> 08:27.435
Put that scabbard away!

08:32.365 --> 08:33.480
Stand up!

08:38.014 --> 08:39.418
Cathatonia

08:39.719 --> 08:41.936
And it's also from Bedlam.

08:42.827 --> 08:45.687
We had access to the records which
might have helped us save this man.

08:45.745 --> 08:47.663
Please, stop!
-I smell whisky.

08:47.818 --> 08:48.815
and despair.

08:48.884 --> 08:50.520
Your children
are never rambunctious

08:50.604 --> 08:53.397
And for professional aims you're
spending way to much time with us

08:53.480 --> 08:56.215
so I'm guessing you have a
major case of writer's block

08:56.315 --> 08:58.999
Keeping home's dad is pretty
more difficult than I thought

08:59.106 --> 09:00.312
So it weren't worth?

09:00.409 --> 09:02.039
Give people what they want.

09:02.110 --> 09:04.234
More showup is more bore-
-Win, win.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.825
It's more complicated than that.

09:05.854 --> 09:06.960
Oh, my god!

09:09.653 --> 09:10.884
Another reaction.

09:11.139 --> 09:12.581
A configuration

09:12.643 --> 09:14.576
similar to the one we saw
in Molly

09:14.750 --> 09:17.821
Not similar.
Identical.

09:22.243 --> 09:24.139
This can't be random,
it has to be a pattern

09:24.205 --> 09:25.250
I don't see a pattern.

09:25.438 --> 09:26.777
I think I do.

09:26.804 --> 09:28.610
it's real built to spot patterns

09:28.768 --> 09:30.107
help us pick out hind predators

09:30.163 --> 09:31.581
xxx?

09:31.649 --> 09:34.155
and makes us see faces everywhere:
from man to moon to

09:34.304 --> 09:35.415
Jesus in a piece of toast.

09:35.437 --> 09:37.923
Sometimes it stays in front of
people's head.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.203
Oh, come on. You're playing
connect the dots

09:40.221 --> 09:41.719
You can make anything

09:42.793 --> 09:44.480
I know where I've seen it before.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.445
All the marks of the bad.

09:47.841 --> 09:50.106
This is helpful, means we have
not to wound up all demons...

09:50.260 --> 09:51.212
Just the bad.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.548
His points really suggest
a pentagram

09:53.977 --> 09:56.971
and Arthur made you
clearly looks like a bear.

09:57.745 --> 10:00.639
Abbadon, Lord of the Abyss

10:00.734 --> 10:03.048
paralyses his victims with fear

10:03.124 --> 10:05.499
so that he may feed on
the souls.

10:05.599 --> 10:08.000
leaving his marks on his preys

10:08.238 --> 10:10.669
It is the demonic equivalent
to stigmata.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.235
muss skin writing

10:12.527 --> 10:15.020
Some people can cause a
spontaneous allergic reaction

10:15.053 --> 10:17.336
and unconsciously forming
into whatever they want.

10:17.426 --> 10:19.469
It's like... getting a
tatoo without a needle.

10:19.611 --> 10:20.715
It's very tricky.

10:20.846 --> 10:23.173
How does one consciously
do sometfhing...

10:23.447 --> 10:25.893
when one is unconscious?

10:28.778 --> 10:31.024
The very question is why does
our Addy

10:31.109 --> 10:33.259
have big book with creepy symbols?

10:44.071 --> 10:45.594
It's my husband's.

10:46.275 --> 10:48.423
The ring is marking that.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.251
It's the insignia of
Anarchism

10:53.219 --> 10:55.129
Those guys have done some
nasty things.

10:55.323 --> 10:57.863
You think he was involved
with these assassins

10:58.024 --> 11:00.011
I think he was trying
to stop them.

11:00.173 --> 11:01.874
That's why he was killed.

11:02.451 --> 11:05.039
They left him hanging in
the study for me to find.

11:08.176 --> 11:11.083
I'm Little Guy's Trumsey Lordship
Justice's office

11:11.109 --> 11:11.788
Thank you.

11:13.597 --> 11:14.097
Ah!

11:14.477 --> 11:16.256
We have a warrant.

11:19.472 --> 11:22.106
We'll see the priest first, then
your records.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.322
Nathaniel.

11:41.456 --> 11:43.306
I've been waiting for you three.

11:43.687 --> 11:44.677
Nice jacket.

11:44.735 --> 11:46.125
I own one just like that home.

11:47.527 --> 11:50.999
Do you know Molly Morgan
and Samir Fleming.

11:52.206 --> 11:53.875
They were my akanans(?)

11:55.128 --> 11:56.711
and quite a number of them.

11:57.077 --> 11:58.433
How many?

12:01.211 --> 12:02.532
Molly's dead.

12:02.643 --> 12:03.773
insomnia catatonics.

12:04.206 --> 12:06.461
He has fulfilled that purpose.

12:06.908 --> 12:08.826
The beast must be fed

12:08.947 --> 12:10.591
All of them still alive.

12:10.913 --> 12:12.782
But his soul is gone.

12:17.326 --> 12:19.211
I think he uses narcissus

12:22.105 --> 12:23.990
I need no such trickery.

12:24.913 --> 12:27.719
I corrupt the sense for
Abaddon's feed off.

12:28.599 --> 12:29.892
How do you do that?

12:30.567 --> 12:32.642
Spirituals deepest to the end.

12:33.783 --> 12:35.679
And it is a simple matter

12:36.792 --> 12:38.085
Do you know what I most fear?

12:38.605 --> 12:41.087
Being condemned to the
same manner as me

12:41.863 --> 12:43.777
I see that you are weak

12:44.534 --> 12:46.758
Prisoner of your first

12:47.969 --> 12:49.479
And it will be long

12:51.687 --> 12:53.162
It's enough of that! Guard!

12:53.222 --> 12:54.739
It's never enough!

12:54.934 --> 12:57.437
Abaddon

13:10.652 --> 13:13.232
It's nothing more than a
talented code reader turner

13:13.403 --> 13:15.232
Crap credit for what happens to the victims

13:15.572 --> 13:17.413
No code reading can make
Molly in

13:17.453 --> 13:18.322
behaves as they did.

13:18.778 --> 13:22.216
All makes the mockery badges in
their bodies. (???)

13:22.562 --> 13:23.923
Here's another one.

13:23.998 --> 13:25.652
That's 5 patients

13:25.735 --> 13:29.013
They had contact with
Nathaniel or xxx? somewhere

13:29.143 --> 13:31.511
Time abounds waste
to go - What's that one?

13:32.240 --> 13:34.251
The patients it's not relevant.

13:35.985 --> 13:38.196
I'll ask xxx to check them down.

13:38.383 --> 13:41.866
You two go. And I will
see what Dr. Randall has to say

13:53.142 --> 13:56.376
I believe permitting one's
fears to paper

13:56.613 --> 13:58.620
as effect to defining it

13:58.774 --> 14:01.633
and wanting to find
and can be tacked it

14:01.913 --> 14:04.551
Molly's  xxxx ... what was
her condition when you released her?

14:04.628 --> 14:06.547
I thought them cured.

14:06.636 --> 14:08.831
That's arrogant, I know

14:08.977 --> 14:10.438
Now just sounds foolish.

14:10.571 --> 14:12.494
How a man like this
Nathaniel was allowed

14:12.534 --> 14:14.227
contact with
vulnerable patients?

14:14.302 --> 14:16.630
Not just allowed, encouraged

14:16.940 --> 14:18.580
and not by me.

14:18.751 --> 14:20.774
Dr. Pearson believes if we

14:20.845 --> 14:23.399
terrifies the patients with demons...

14:23.583 --> 14:24.908
they will come running to God

14:25.032 --> 14:27.164
He's using fear to manipulate them.

14:27.543 --> 14:29.301
Fear is the disease itself.

14:29.529 --> 14:30.735
He doesn't understand that.

14:30.778 --> 14:33.171
What about the rest of
Dr. Pearson's psychotherapies?

14:33.308 --> 14:35.058
Electroshock or the xxxx?

14:35.344 --> 14:37.168
He assures me he has success

14:37.292 --> 14:39.332
It's barbaric and you know it.

14:41.288 --> 14:42.460
I have a court order.

14:42.517 --> 14:43.798
I intend to search his place...

14:43.865 --> 14:45.654
and find how everything that
is going in here

14:45.765 --> 14:47.270
and stop the abuse!

14:47.446 --> 14:50.136
And I count on you help
or your hindrance

14:52.609 --> 14:54.991
We have much to discuss

14:55.230 --> 14:57.051
Can I offer you a cup of tea?

14:57.154 --> 14:57.850
Yes.

15:41.639 --> 15:42.927
Help me!

15:47.057 --> 15:49.049
Stop.

15:49.217 --> 15:51.206
The world takes a witcher

16:27.570 --> 16:29.913
B.R.H.

17:01.668 --> 17:03.344
[Dr. Pilsen]

17:21.661 --> 17:23.971
Four of the five released innates
have been found

17:24.040 --> 17:26.295
in detained, safe and healty.

17:26.365 --> 17:28.320
so trying to find an
address for the fifth.

17:28.982 --> 17:30.631
It just leaves one question:

17:30.962 --> 17:33.729
So, what's in the file you're
xxx ?   such an approach

17:37.916 --> 17:40.510
It's the coroner's report in
Nigel Pennington.

17:42.278 --> 17:45.403
No water found in lungs.
Likely strangulation

17:46.207 --> 17:47.635
It's suspicious stuff

17:48.522 --> 17:52.568
Billy has no leads
no suspects

17:53.659 --> 17:56.085
Long time with this guy?

17:56.574 --> 17:58.404
He was my husband's friend.

17:58.694 --> 17:59.960
And his business partner

18:00.146 --> 18:03.106
The police said Benjamin
gambled all our money away

18:03.182 --> 18:04.965
Nigel thought he'd
embezzled it.

18:05.164 --> 18:07.531
My tining was loss ?????

18:08.432 --> 18:10.549
well, five in nine you do
your

18:10.646 --> 18:12.172
Nigel was trying to
open in questioning if

18:12.222 --> 18:14.078
this was a hide and I wanted too

18:14.209 --> 18:16.647
You don't think your husband
gave off the money away

18:23.028 --> 18:24.993
Benjamin took me to
Eifell Tower

18:25.170 --> 18:28.170
Not to see the structure
or enjoy the view.

18:29.001 --> 18:31.490
he really kissed at
the top of the world

18:35.903 --> 18:37.521
He wasn't a gambler.

18:40.529 --> 18:42.270
He was a romantic.

18:43.711 --> 18:44.792
Yeah.

18:45.188 --> 18:48.622
Maybe you two were obviously
mutually exclusive?

19:07.496 --> 19:09.872
Dr. Pilsen is ruthless
and unyielding,

19:09.951 --> 19:12.271
devoid of any redeemable
human qualities.

19:12.326 --> 19:15.382
He has subjected me to one
unspeakable torture after

19:15.440 --> 19:18.567
another, each one more
horrible than the last.

19:18.650 --> 19:21.915
He has forced me to worship
Abaddon and enabled

19:21.925 --> 19:24.060
this monster to reveal its
hideous visage to me.

19:24.134 --> 19:25.332
There are no words

19:26.335 --> 19:28.256
You bastard!
-Don't, please.

19:28.310 --> 19:30.654
I know what you did
to my father.

19:30.897 --> 19:32.056
Yourself a father

19:32.194 --> 19:33.751
I-I do charge...
-Talk to me!

19:33.939 --> 19:35.795
-Detective!
You tortured him to death.

19:35.973 --> 19:37.481
You... you've been drinking.

19:37.482 --> 19:40.493
Perhaps your wife's condition
is too stressful to you.

19:40.777 --> 19:41.726
You can

19:41.857 --> 19:44.969
If I could give you a teinture
a lot that mean to opium

19:45.464 --> 19:47.414
You clearly need help
to order things

19:47.496 --> 19:49.195
something to break you anxiety?

19:49.313 --> 19:50.952
I'm not the crazy one!

19:51.106 --> 19:52.443
Nor was my father!

19:52.538 --> 19:53.926
Your father was savaged from...

19:53.965 --> 19:56.903
Dementia  preacox was a very

19:56.942 --> 19:58.960
-What you did to him!

20:01.172 --> 20:02.419
What's this?

20:02.642 --> 20:03.605
I'm .... you!

20:03.612 --> 20:05.527
You can't! You can't!

20:05.576 --> 20:07.145
You don't
just .... me up!

20:07.348 --> 20:08.055
No! No!

20:09.116 --> 20:11.840
Your father xxxx?
I'm afraid

20:12.661 --> 20:14.592
I'm sorry, Arthur.
'Noooo!

20:15.695 --> 20:16.491
Sorry.

20:38.717 --> 20:40.301
No el back yet?

20:40.358 --> 20:40.858
No.

20:41.171 --> 20:43.008
Then, I can't admit he was right.

20:43.145 --> 20:45.413
I know you think abaddon
was behind this.

20:45.557 --> 20:46.116
Don't be cute.

20:46.220 --> 20:48.623
I do think that something erratic
is going on in that asylum.

20:48.717 --> 20:51.276
I think that we should go back and
open every file they have.

20:51.689 --> 20:53.346
I thinl that we should
get on fast

21:09.749 --> 21:11.248
I've ordered to see my solicitor

21:11.338 --> 21:12.494
No one even know I'm in here.

21:12.970 --> 21:14.420
Meet your new roommate

21:14.496 --> 21:16.663
You. and your bloody solicitor!

21:16.723 --> 21:18.424
No, no, this isn't right.

21:18.801 --> 21:20.333
This time it is not so amusing, is it?

21:20.416 --> 21:21.838
What Pilsen is doing is ilegal

21:21.939 --> 21:23.953
You have to alert
Scotland Yard.

21:24.376 --> 21:25.489
Guard!

21:26.277 --> 21:27.536
Guard!

21:30.340 --> 21:32.432
I've been thinking...
- Not talking to you.

21:33.078 --> 21:34.585
Name it.

21:34.853 --> 21:35.810
Puffy eyes,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.986
you've been drinking heavily

21:38.130 --> 21:39.679
Apparently

21:39.823 --> 21:41.836
All you're doing is
drink is nurse

21:42.202 --> 21:44.140
Just the same old
long term

21:44.268 --> 21:46.032
abuse the devil's muscle

21:46.105 --> 21:49.067
one symptom of an
even bigger problem

21:49.589 --> 21:50.708
Fear.

21:50.858 --> 21:52.271
Of course I'm scared. I'm locked

21:52.313 --> 21:53.635
in a bloody mental hospital.

21:53.794 --> 21:55.758
What happened? Somebody
steal your identity?

21:55.826 --> 21:58.373
and now they call you crazy
as soon as you mention your name.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.029
Christi for head

22:01.363 --> 22:02.598
daunting eyes

22:02.730 --> 22:04.015
stupid pa.xxxxx

22:05.098 --> 22:07.074
So is the fear is within
you your entire life.

22:07.153 --> 22:08.356
Whine.

22:09.307 --> 22:11.244
What's wounded you so profoundly?

22:11.276 --> 22:13.432
More importantly,
why did you kill

22:13.486 --> 22:15.323
my fictional counterpart?

22:15.480 --> 22:17.299
Han
was a white lighting

22:17.337 --> 22:19.230
stood in the way of
something more profound

22:20.037 --> 22:22.828
It's a tad more personal and
I find interesting to me

22:22.893 --> 22:25.205
We must... after your father died.

22:25.849 --> 22:28.394
You're true Sherlock over the fons

22:34.280 --> 22:35.710
I made some inquiries

22:35.815 --> 22:37.667
Doyle's father was a patient
at den.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.422
where he died years ago.

22:40.802 --> 22:42.709
Well, then that explains
Doyle's behaviour.

22:43.155 --> 22:44.480
and that file.

22:46.738 --> 22:47.593
Let me guess.

22:47.688 --> 22:50.484
Daddy loved you when you
became a doctor and hated it

22:50.583 --> 22:52.588
when you became a rack
although within it

22:52.673 --> 22:56.127
every once in a while he did have
a inspired term or phrase. They say

22:56.705 --> 22:59.153
a little insanity steers
the creative juices

22:59.240 --> 23:00.553
I'm not insane.

23:00.701 --> 23:02.849
Your surroundings suggest
otherwise

23:02.892 --> 23:05.531
Did he ever whatso acknowledge you

23:05.631 --> 23:06.824
as a writer?

23:11.415 --> 23:14.185
Sherlock was one of my successful
characters in the history of fiction

23:15.126 --> 23:16.751
Not fiction

23:17.794 --> 23:19.207
I need to get out of here.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.734
Are you going to
embrace your intuition

23:20.753 --> 23:22.556
and see this as an opportunity

23:22.617 --> 23:24.615
to investigate from inside?

23:26.113 --> 23:27.535
I suppose I could

23:27.619 --> 23:30.357
Trying find proof that my father
was right, proof of abaddon

23:30.605 --> 23:32.964
I termed down the Abaddon

23:33.094 --> 23:34.663
disfocused in Nathaniel

23:35.750 --> 23:37.401
How did you know about the case?

23:37.468 --> 23:38.776
I hear things

23:38.905 --> 23:42.769
When thinking of your backing mad
known it is descripted so xxxx to matter

23:42.866 --> 23:44.357
Ah, really, you did?

23:44.679 --> 23:46.107
Professor Moriarty...

23:46.292 --> 23:48.034
An evil stepmother

23:48.858 --> 23:51.307
The victims died in a state

23:51.421 --> 23:53.663
of great fear. They also exhibited

23:53.765 --> 23:54.932
dry grangene

23:55.038 --> 23:57.744
and parathesis to everything
to may be in poison

23:58.910 --> 24:01.074
You are the fear inducing poison

24:01.128 --> 24:02.976
in study in scarlet

24:03.116 --> 24:04.226
Ergot...

24:04.527 --> 24:06.621
causes terrifying allucination

24:20.901 --> 24:23.376
The house of Charles Doyle

24:23.564 --> 24:25.010
offered purchase

24:25.298 --> 24:27.037
I thought he was just
sleeping in

24:27.068 --> 24:28.459
but his bed is untouched

24:28.513 --> 24:30.759
He mustn't come home
at all last night.

24:30.823 --> 24:32.244
Daddy?

24:32.561 --> 24:34.209
It's not your father, love.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.315
Where is he?

24:35.468 --> 24:36.768
I'm not sure.

24:38.217 --> 24:40.124
I'm Adelaide

24:41.744 --> 24:43.173
You must be Kingsley.

24:43.396 --> 24:45.634
Your father told me
so much about you.

24:45.807 --> 24:47.552
Mostly good.

24:47.740 --> 24:49.579
I don't like broccoli either.

24:51.232 --> 24:52.612
You're a policeman.

24:52.865 --> 24:54.124
I am.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.501
And we are going to
find your father.

24:58.166 --> 24:59.423
I promise.

25:09.448 --> 25:11.689
I think he told Nathaniel,
which is why

25:11.736 --> 25:13.560
I devised a way to get
you into his cell

25:13.607 --> 25:14.473
A five ways to find me

25:14.544 --> 25:16.561
before those animals give in
xxxx concussion

25:16.676 --> 25:17.795
I asked them five?

25:17.848 --> 25:18.967
Guard! Come quick!

25:20.079 --> 25:22.420
Dr. Doyle needs help
utterly consumption

25:22.489 --> 25:24.767
Otherwise at least eight
other helmet

25:24.804 --> 25:26.256
with manifest similar symptoms

25:26.333 --> 25:27.217
Look it!

25:35.088 --> 25:37.651
I thought you said this method
didn't involve knock him out

25:37.742 --> 25:40.045
I naild. I just
expect you'd disapprove

25:41.150 --> 25:43.421
Stakes and high enough to justify headache

25:45.695 --> 25:48.750
Prep xxx and mild brain injury

25:53.554 --> 25:55.574
You'd better come through.

25:55.839 --> 25:57.636
It's too late for that.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.441
Abaddon has come for me.

25:59.605 --> 26:01.361
Your followers flow

26:01.410 --> 26:02.738
We think they were poisoned.

26:02.808 --> 26:03.739
Yeah.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.422
Abaddon lost
this Milice

26:06.569 --> 26:08.210
Your father ricketed of it.

26:08.426 --> 26:10.298
How would you know about my father?

26:10.461 --> 26:13.281
He died eight years ago,
before you came to Bedlam.

26:13.728 --> 26:16.194
Badness always been here...

26:16.290 --> 26:18.894
is everywhere the true
has been xxx?

26:19.268 --> 26:21.842
Your father xxx good to weakness

26:21.964 --> 26:25.297
so easy to squeeze
life out of him

26:25.505 --> 26:27.077
He's girding you!

26:27.673 --> 26:29.078
Do you wak to Pilsen?

26:29.165 --> 26:31.117
I have but one master

26:31.653 --> 26:33.625
As does the

26:33.708 --> 26:36.159
Pilsen's access to a pattern

26:36.227 --> 26:38.193
That's why he brought me here.

26:39.188 --> 26:40.612
Act you.

26:45.643 --> 26:47.273
This is impossible.

26:51.403 --> 26:52.660
Apparently not.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.423
Doyle!

26:54.703 --> 26:55.320
What have you done?

26:55.465 --> 26:58.334
No. I didn't even tie.
I just came to talk to him.

26:58.756 --> 27:00.186
He was tactic garden!

27:01.637 --> 27:03.997
No, I've never touched him.
Some force... wrenched his neck.

27:04.048 --> 27:05.867
He said Abaddon was coming
for him. Tell him!

27:05.904 --> 27:08.372
He dragged me in here. I had
no idea he was going to do this.

27:08.405 --> 27:09.413
What? No!

27:09.491 --> 27:11.905
Tell him. Wait!
No! He's lying.

27:12.136 --> 27:14.759
No! No! No!

27:41.002 --> 27:42.617
I liked your father.

27:44.655 --> 27:46.442
But I failed him.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.105
Even if I've
here

27:49.146 --> 27:51.713
I'm sure he would be alive
and be grateful today.

27:52.500 --> 27:53.499
It will xxxx your writing,

27:53.570 --> 27:57.093
but it's a small price to
bury xxxx xxxxxx

27:59.601 --> 28:01.018
Doyle! Doyle!

28:10.980 --> 28:12.670
No, no, no!

28:13.424 --> 28:14.939
No, please!

28:15.226 --> 28:15.983
I need to write

28:16.050 --> 28:17.319
Ease. Relax.

28:18.054 --> 28:18.842
Just relax.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.057
Excuse me.

28:21.599 --> 28:23.693
Please, don't drill into
my friend's brain.

28:24.356 --> 28:25.282
Attendent!

28:25.324 --> 28:26.759
They are indisposed.

28:26.890 --> 28:29.445
By indisposed, I mean...
unconscious.

28:29.557 --> 28:31.883
Let me apologize in advance
to rendering you...

28:31.964 --> 28:33.452
unconscious as well.

28:35.041 --> 28:36.130
What do you say?

28:36.270 --> 28:38.310
By earlier to betrayal was
just ruth

28:38.351 --> 28:40.549
I had sixty to ablutions
xxxxx???

28:40.592 --> 28:42.463
only if you'd like the most
satisfying conclusion.

28:42.508 --> 28:43.970
Wait! Wait!

28:44.180 --> 28:46.496
Fergus was in an early draught of
the studing scholar

28:46.530 --> 28:47.967
But I caught it before it went to print.

28:48.054 --> 28:50.304
How could you know about it?
-We're in the middle of this thrilling escape

28:50.461 --> 28:52.317
What did you think of...
Come on!

28:53.532 --> 28:54.894
There's our way out.

29:03.038 --> 29:04.338
No!

29:08.232 --> 29:09.116
Doyle!

29:15.005 --> 29:17.157
There must be a logical
out to this.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.845
Nothing is making sense!

29:18.907 --> 29:20.897
Whenever I'm lying, you
steal for me

29:20.982 --> 29:22.926
What you eliminate as impossible

29:22.996 --> 29:24.317
Whatever remains...

29:24.758 --> 29:27.704
everything here is impossible.
-And therefore?

29:29.718 --> 29:32.519
everything is a signal
to my imagination.

29:32.992 --> 29:34.170
Including you.

29:36.051 --> 29:37.826
I'm just like everything
deuce.

29:38.380 --> 29:39.876
I've been giver ergot.

29:40.806 --> 29:42.491
I'm allucinating.

29:43.036 --> 29:44.394
The real me

29:45.310 --> 29:47.351
is dying.

29:52.847 --> 29:53.951
Convulsions...

29:54.388 --> 29:55.934
shock, oedema

29:56.144 --> 29:58.478
My best guess is
some sort of poison

29:58.559 --> 30:00.601
Unfortunately it is impossible
to tell which one.

30:04.230 --> 30:05.240
Ergot.

30:06.354 --> 30:07.167
Yes!

30:07.804 --> 30:09.692
Ergot concerning explains
all the symptoms

30:10.058 --> 30:11.692
How did you ever think of that?

30:12.082 --> 30:13.526
Lucky guess.

30:16.026 --> 30:18.459
Daddy?
-Kingsley.

30:18.698 --> 30:20.954
We found him and we're
going to make it better

30:21.048 --> 30:22.172
Good as new.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.154
Alright?

30:23.295 --> 30:25.619
I'm afraid the children
can't be in here.

30:26.115 --> 30:29.012
No! We're not leaving our father!

30:29.262 --> 30:30.661
We are throwing them out?

30:31.155 --> 30:33.931
Now that I xxx, there's nothing
I can do for him

30:45.000 --> 30:47.041
You have to find a way
out of your life now.

30:48.723 --> 30:49.881
Arthur!

30:54.342 --> 30:55.401
Tully!

31:02.778 --> 31:05.499
I haven't given up. I've been
searching the world for a cure.

31:05.726 --> 31:07.041
Well, stop searching.

31:07.134 --> 31:08.701
as I felt wonderful.

31:10.634 --> 31:13.157
He said ergot take 12
hours to peak.

31:13.202 --> 31:15.731
Both victims had their breakdown
the day they were released

31:15.796 --> 31:18.001
which means they were at Bethlem
when they were poisoned

31:18.102 --> 31:19.720
Nathaniel confined himself

31:19.798 --> 31:21.767
so... that lets him out of the hook.

31:22.150 --> 31:24.784
When'd everyone else were
scared peak to death

31:25.412 --> 31:26.568
Thrills?

31:27.102 --> 31:29.954
The only ones with access to the
victims were Pilsen and Randall

31:30.204 --> 31:32.856
But the only time Doyle
saw Pilsen he was with us

31:33.958 --> 31:35.766
And the only time
he wasn't with us

31:35.823 --> 31:37.314
he met Randall

31:42.273 --> 31:44.002
You think 'I' poisoned him?

31:44.143 --> 31:46.440
I'm trying to figure it out
why anybody would kill people

31:46.506 --> 31:48.388
in such a torturous way...

31:48.519 --> 31:49.769
But you're a scientist.

31:49.894 --> 31:52.701
You're not trying to kill the failures,
you're trying to kill the mothers.

31:53.314 --> 31:56.383
The way Pasteur inoculated
people against rabies

31:56.780 --> 31:58.212
by giving them small dosis.

31:58.266 --> 32:01.032
And how do you suppose
I administered this... poison?

32:01.115 --> 32:02.263
It's called ergot.

32:02.532 --> 32:04.266
As some kind of rife fungus.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.105
And we were wondering the
same thing.

32:06.153 --> 32:07.626
How the heck do you get...

32:07.776 --> 32:09.980
rife fungus in some way?

32:10.131 --> 32:11.343
Bread I suppose

32:11.496 --> 32:13.548
Certain drinks, beer and alcohol.

32:14.788 --> 32:16.365
Tea? - Like any good scientist

32:16.398 --> 32:18.511
you wouldn't take experiment with
something you can't control.

32:18.619 --> 32:20.179
I think you have an antidote

32:20.537 --> 32:22.001
Why would I have an antidote...?

32:22.173 --> 32:23.820
to a poison I don't have?

32:23.929 --> 32:25.160
You'd better have.

32:25.305 --> 32:26.780
Because I xxx your tea were eregot

32:28.374 --> 32:30.144
I do the sure thing professional.

32:30.171 --> 32:32.677
Stop you before you took
poison to any other poor people

32:32.715 --> 32:34.076
What are y ou doing?

32:34.317 --> 32:37.029
You can't kill me! -I think you would
give us the antidote before that.

32:37.083 --> 32:38.708
No. Don't do this.

32:39.061 --> 32:39.983
I'm so close.

32:40.177 --> 32:42.003
If I can kill fear

32:42.136 --> 32:43.599
It is  .

32:43.667 --> 32:45.909
Save so many lives from ruin.

32:45.980 --> 32:48.542
Yes. All those dies you caused,
will you undo?

33:02.415 --> 33:04.955
You told me you knew
how to sail.

33:05.064 --> 33:07.327
Like you told me you
know how to ski.

33:07.412 --> 33:08.613
'Cause I can ski.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.733
Take me to Mont Blanc
and I will show you.

33:11.607 --> 33:13.173
Yes, of course you can.

33:16.266 --> 33:17.771
Because you're not real.

33:30.969 --> 33:32.554
Why does that matter?

33:41.986 --> 33:42.801
The feelings are real.

33:43.913 --> 33:45.310
It's not enough?

33:45.498 --> 33:47.034
That's everything.

33:50.275 --> 33:52.257
I must go back.

33:55.125 --> 33:56.924
You have to want me die.

33:59.170 --> 33:59.942
I know.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.027
Then, why?

34:04.213 --> 34:06.621
Why go back to
all that pain?

34:07.460 --> 34:08.592
That torment...

34:10.003 --> 34:11.561
Because it's real.

34:12.929 --> 34:15.440
It's the pain that is real,
and so is the joy.

34:16.992 --> 34:18.280
Was about me?

34:21.257 --> 34:22.655
You're a dream.

34:24.021 --> 34:25.523
A beautiful dream.

34:30.967 --> 34:32.264
I'm sorry.

34:35.715 --> 34:36.940
Good bye, my love.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.449
Is it the dream like?

35:02.655 --> 35:04.548
That's the product ofyour dying brain.

35:05.141 --> 35:06.556
There's not much time left.

35:06.661 --> 35:08.141
There must be a way out of this.

35:08.199 --> 35:10.092
Ergot is the surge on
real vendor

35:10.152 --> 35:12.052
Can you possibly do abandon that?

35:13.460 --> 35:14.456
Euphoria.

35:14.675 --> 35:16.012
It's massive surge

35:16.134 --> 35:19.132
which spikes all calcium to constrict
peripheral blood vessels.

35:19.186 --> 35:20.527
Probably kill me

35:20.793 --> 35:23.726
It's the only thing that will
physically stop the encore

35:24.532 --> 35:27.121
How might I feel euphoria
in this place?

35:27.371 --> 35:30.344
By eliminating... your misery.

35:31.494 --> 35:33.443
What is causing all the dark

35:33.498 --> 35:35.514
memories of this house, son?

35:38.375 --> 35:40.164
Go on, say it.

35:41.831 --> 35:42.913
Father.

35:43.478 --> 35:45.981
In the flesh. So to speak.

35:49.784 --> 35:50.833
Am I dead?

35:52.277 --> 35:53.594
No, Arthur.

35:54.123 --> 35:56.309
You're losing your mind.

36:05.690 --> 36:07.534
Out of way!

36:10.737 --> 36:13.445
No, no, no, no!

36:13.527 --> 36:15.027
You're alright?
-Yes.

36:16.998 --> 36:19.231
Surprising thing that all your
problems are my fault.

36:20.257 --> 36:21.739
Do you deny that you
didn't have the

36:21.780 --> 36:23.139
faintest idea how
to be a father?

36:23.197 --> 36:24.773
Yes, I was a troubled father.

36:25.306 --> 36:26.425
All better now?

36:26.552 --> 36:27.097
Bastard.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.614
Hum. Hard enough.

36:30.541 --> 36:31.891
So that's it?

36:32.038 --> 36:33.875
What is this really about?

36:34.347 --> 36:35.411
Oh, I know.

36:35.498 --> 36:36.791
Your precious work.

36:38.088 --> 36:41.047
Most fathers would be proud
of what I created.

36:41.356 --> 36:42.467
Sherlock Holmes.

36:42.532 --> 36:44.838
The most skeptical asshole who ever lived.

36:44.958 --> 36:47.487
You hated my work because
it was a fictional character.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.481
Character who was contemptous
with everything that I was

36:50.802 --> 36:54.351
Character you made up that way with
the sole purpose of hurting me.

36:54.418 --> 36:56.527
Of course I wanted to hurt you.

36:56.833 --> 36:59.358
You were an alcoholic madman.

36:59.538 --> 37:01.423
And the best day of my life

37:01.536 --> 37:03.280
was the day they took you away.

37:04.467 --> 37:06.527
You know that's not true.

37:09.293 --> 37:10.108
There, now.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.318
Steady, steady.

37:20.326 --> 37:23.327
Dr. Doyle.
Steady... steady.

37:29.050 --> 37:31.103
The alcohol was my fault,
the madness was not.

37:31.139 --> 37:32.637
And whose fault was it, mine?

37:32.702 --> 37:34.673
It was no one fault.

37:34.822 --> 37:36.422
Do you know how miserable I was?

37:36.697 --> 37:39.324
To have such a lunatic
for a father

37:39.545 --> 37:43.000
Do you know the utter horror
of losing one's mind?

37:43.246 --> 37:47.028
At first, I tried to justify, it was a
quark of creative brain.

37:47.873 --> 37:50.090
Then I tried to camouflage
with alcohol.

37:50.210 --> 37:51.873
It bottled to the piano

37:51.943 --> 37:53.893
Better a lash than a
nut case.

37:54.789 --> 37:57.054
But I kept thinking deeper and deeper

37:57.114 --> 37:59.291
until it took everything from me

38:00.530 --> 38:02.300
My work...

38:02.539 --> 38:04.268
Your dear mother...

38:05.485 --> 38:07.119
Your brothers and sisters...

38:08.690 --> 38:10.342
You.
-Hum!

38:11.224 --> 38:12.856
Quite the  xxx?

38:13.690 --> 38:16.561
Would this all of this be different
if I remained the doctor?

38:16.715 --> 38:17.614
Probably.

38:18.344 --> 38:21.793
If it was anyone that I read your work to
I came to despise you.

38:38.603 --> 38:41.052
It was my work that awful?

38:44.186 --> 38:44.686
No.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.253
Her father and brothers
were aclaimed artists.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.025
I was...

38:54.795 --> 38:56.369
The disappointment...

38:56.909 --> 39:00.038
And you came along and
it was so easy for you.

39:00.693 --> 39:04.668
Your brilliance illuminated
my mediocrity

39:05.847 --> 39:09.501
My death didn't warrant a single
obituary in the newspaper.

39:10.637 --> 39:14.759
And yet the entire world mourned
the death of your cartoon.

39:15.724 --> 39:17.601
Why couldn't you tell me?

39:19.496 --> 39:20.925
Because I was a weak...

39:21.315 --> 39:22.869
and a petty little man.

39:25.224 --> 39:26.998
I didn't despise you.

39:27.981 --> 39:30.355
I despised myself.

39:33.072 --> 39:34.980
I know it's to late, but...

39:36.686 --> 39:38.570
but would you allow me
to do something that

39:38.610 --> 39:41.208
I wish I had the courage
to do when I was alive?

40:20.722 --> 40:21.842
Thank you.

40:24.465 --> 40:27.898
But you were thinking that
this was a shade to fuss out.

40:28.865 --> 40:32.376
And you will just realise I'm
just a figment of your imagination.

40:32.891 --> 40:34.170
Precisely.

40:36.045 --> 40:39.400
Hum, I thank you to take
my word for it.

41:02.407 --> 41:03.429
Daddy?

41:07.353 --> 41:08.659
Come here, son.

41:16.592 --> 41:18.811
I was never cross with you

41:20.416 --> 41:21.702
Nor you.

41:23.806 --> 41:25.440
I was cross with myself.

41:28.949 --> 41:32.097
You gave Adelaide and your
kids a hell of a scare.

41:32.264 --> 41:34.378
Yes, all three of us.

41:34.914 --> 41:37.012
It wasn't Pilsen, was it?

41:37.101 --> 41:38.577
It was Randall.

41:39.068 --> 41:40.632
How could you possibly learn that?

41:40.956 --> 41:42.657
Holmes cracked the case.

41:44.568 --> 41:47.797
Up here, the case was
cracked by Houdini.

41:47.942 --> 41:50.663
Figured out that your
poison was Ergot.

41:50.878 --> 41:52.849
How could you poss...?

41:56.070 --> 41:56.947
No!

41:58.045 --> 41:59.623
No. I don't know what are you thinking

41:59.664 --> 42:01.311
but put off that grin off your face

42:01.443 --> 42:04.239
They must've communicated
that to you telepathically

42:04.351 --> 42:08.009
Or... it came to me in one of my
frequent bursts of inspiration

42:08.291 --> 42:10.199
And where did that inspiration come from?

42:10.266 --> 42:13.197
Please, let him
have the last word.

42:19.293 --> 42:22.182
And one last signature.

42:26.882 --> 42:29.574
Thank you, Dr.  Doyle.
-Thank you.

43:55.012 --> 43:56.032
I love you, ma.
