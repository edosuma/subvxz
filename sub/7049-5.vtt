WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:03.211
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.295 --> 00:06.506
I overheard every word of that conversation
between you and Crowder,

00:06.590 --> 00:07.715
and I want that money.

00:07.800 --> 00:13.763
How am I gonna get my hands on that money,
you think, while I am inside here?

00:15.265 --> 00:17.016
Nap time's over, gimpy.

00:18.102 --> 00:19.268
There you go.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.395
What the hell, man?

00:20.479 --> 00:21.688
You're free, brother.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.690
Free where? Where the hell am I?

00:23.774 --> 00:25.858
- You're out of Tramble.
- Well, awesome.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.110
If things go well.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.319
How are you doing, Ash?

00:32.281 --> 00:33.366
Let's go.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.951
You know where they're going?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.077
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.413
So hard to get cell phone service
in these holler roads.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.248
Fine! But you got to promise me that,

00:40.332 --> 00:43.292
no matter how weird this thing gets,
you say I cooperated.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.336
See, Tanner's kind of like my talent scout.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.840
From what I've heard, you have been
pushed to a second tier position

00:48.924 --> 00:50.633
at an enterprise that's going nowhere fast.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.176
What, are you saying
you got something better?

00:52.636 --> 00:55.722
Devil, whatever led you to believe
that you could pull this off?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.474
Wait!

00:58.809 --> 01:01.436
There's supposed to be $3 million in here,
Limehouse.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.730
Look, it's all spent,
except what you see right there.

01:03.814 --> 01:07.692
I believe the terms of the deal are
I receive the money and then we are through.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.110
That's right. Those are the terms.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.071
Then you take it back. I do not accept this.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.073
If things are going to plan,
we would've heard by now.

01:14.158 --> 01:16.242
So now we got to do the other thing.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.327
Come on, no! No! No!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.415
Hey, before you get in the car,

01:22.499 --> 01:24.667
I may have a way for us
to make some more money.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.715
- What if he finds out?
- What if who finds out about what?

01:30.799 --> 01:32.925
What if Dickie Bennett finds out you lied

01:33.010 --> 01:35.303
when you told him this here
was all that was left of his mama's money?

01:35.387 --> 01:38.431
Well, about the only way I can see him
finding out about this here

01:38.932 --> 01:40.892
is if someone was to tell him.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.102
I ain't the only one who knows.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.774
He does find out,
you know he'll come looking for it.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.192
There'll be no stopping him.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.443
Oh, I'll stop him.

01:51.069 --> 01:54.697
Besides, I hear they fixin'
to send him back to Tramble.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.201
Inside or out, $3 million buy a lot of friends.

01:58.994 --> 02:02.747
Well, anybody comes,
we're gonna stop them.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.333
How it's always been.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.003
And why you asking questions?
You think I ain't taking care of business?

02:10.172 --> 02:11.380
No, sir, Mr. Limehouse.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.300
Just think we should get us
a couple Tramble brothers to shiv his ass.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.179
No. That ain't the agreement
I made with his mama.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.681
I don't know your agreement with his mama.

02:24.269 --> 02:28.314
Boy, what is you really asking?
Where that 3 million is?

02:29.608 --> 02:30.817
No, sir.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.486
So you lay down your head at night,

02:33.570 --> 02:36.405
and you dream about all the living
you could do with that money?

02:36.740 --> 02:40.201
Boy, that dream will get you killed
quicker than a bullet.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.412
Now, you know what you need to know.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.999
And it wasn't no 3 million. Not near.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.126
Now, you get that put away.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.254
I'm gonna go check this smoker here.

02:57.135 --> 03:00.596
Don't know why we're out here
freezing our asses off

03:00.722 --> 03:04.267
instead of just tossing this traitor
in a slurry pond.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.936
Devil was a friend before he became a traitor.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.897
You remember what your daddy used to say?

03:10.190 --> 03:15.069
"Once you make up your mind to kill a man,
there ain't nothing left to talk about."

03:22.995 --> 03:25.580
Thinking about it only makes it harder.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.165
Well, maybe it should be harder.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.879
That kind of attitude might make a man blink
when the moment comes.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.130
Did I blink?

03:49.605 --> 03:52.315
Arlo, there's no need
to rob the bodies of the dead.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.827
Thought we weren't robbing the dead.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.083
This is Devil's last gift to us.

04:13.879 --> 04:18.507
We return to the great unknown a man
with a bellyful of the fruit of temptation.

04:19.259 --> 04:24.138
May his entrance into that world
be more painless than his exit from this one.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.658
I'm sorry.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.494
- I was trying not to wake you.
- I was up.

04:46.578 --> 04:51.582
- Doing what?
- You know, packing, making lists.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.584
Looks smaller, doesn't it?

04:54.378 --> 04:57.672
Yeah, well, they always do, empty.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.218
You remember the first time
you set foot in this house?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.012
You came in the dark that night, too.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.263
Came in through the garden door.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.976
Poor Gary. Scared him half to death.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.853
I apologized for that.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.941
I remember coming down these stairs
and seeing you in the kitchen

05:19.027 --> 05:21.696
and knowing that my marriage to Gary
was over.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.158
I thought you'd be angry,
me coming home at 2:00 in the morning.

05:27.703 --> 05:28.828
Do you want a beer?

05:30.414 --> 05:33.666
Seriously. You're seven weeks pregnant,
ready to move.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.253
I haven't done anything
to line up a place for us.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.671
I'm just out there running and gunning...

05:38.755 --> 05:40.756
All right. You've convinced me. I'm angry.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.550
I'm still not gonna fight with you.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.511
I'm done trying to change who you are.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.516
And I'm done pretending
that I could ever feel about anyone else

05:50.600 --> 05:52.226
the way I feel about you.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.690
That may be the sweetest thing
you ever said to me.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.117
You want a beer or not?

06:27.304 --> 06:28.387
Wake up.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.684
Come on. Wake up, shitbird.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.228
Morning.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.779
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.407
Relax.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.160
Look, we don't have a lot of time.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.413
Well, actually, you don't have a lot of time.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.419
You ever see that movie,
where the evil, spic-a-roo surgeon

07:00.504 --> 07:04.715
snatches up the pretty gringo tourists
and cuts out all their organs,

07:05.217 --> 07:08.094
sells them off to rich folks
who want to skip the transplant line?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.471
Well, it turns out
that's pretty much all bullshit.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.722
Jesus. What did you do to me?

07:11.848 --> 07:15.684
Most organs, your heart, your lungs,

07:15.769 --> 07:18.771
won't stay viable
if removed outside of a hospital setting.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.397
Kidneys, though,

07:20.816 --> 07:23.901
you can take a healthy kidney,
put it on ice for two full days.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.946
Reinstall it, and that baby goes back to work
without ever missing a beat.

07:27.697 --> 07:31.450
Now, there are people all over the world
that are just chomping at the bit

07:31.576 --> 07:36.288
to pay 20, sometimes 30 grand,
for a new pair of kidneys,

07:36.373 --> 07:38.582
and they don't give two shits
where they came from.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.043
You can't take my kidneys.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.258
I already have.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.973
Now, like I said, your kidneys
will do just fine for a while without you.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.643
Unfortunately,
you can't last long without them.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.564
Poisons are gonna begin
to build up in your blood.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.858
It's gonna make your skin change color.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.944
<i>It's gonna feel like someone
reached inside of your guts</i>

08:07.028 --> 08:08.445
and literally just started twisting.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.407
<i>Eventually, you're gonna start puking blood.</i>

08:11.783 --> 08:13.826
<i>Your body's gonna go into convulsions,</i>

08:13.952 --> 08:18.497
and then your muscles are gonna seize up
so hard that your bones will actually break.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.749
Well, how do I stop it?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.376
You could go to the hospital.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.211
<i>Although, seeing as you're a fugitive,</i>

08:24.296 --> 08:27.590
<i>that means you're gonna have to spend the
rest of your life getting dialysis treatments</i>

08:27.674 --> 08:28.966
<i>in a prison infirmary.</i>

08:29.050 --> 08:31.760
Or you can buy them back from me.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.929
I don't have any money.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.433
I suggest you find some.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.394
Let's say 20 grand. Now, you have

08:42.397 --> 08:44.940
four hours to be at this address.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.236
<i>If you're late,</i>

08:50.906 --> 08:52.448
<i>if you don't have the cash,</i>

08:53.366 --> 08:54.950
<i>if you bring the cops,</i>

08:55.619 --> 08:57.411
then I'm gonna sell your kidneys

08:57.495 --> 09:00.039
to a businessman
I already have lined up in Chicago.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.007
Get out of the car. Now!

09:50.840 --> 09:51.924
You sure it was Dewey?

09:52.008 --> 09:54.301
First car on the scene
showed him the fugitive printout.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.552
That's why they called us.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.596
- What about fancy Lance?
- You okay?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.724
- Why?
- When's the last time you slept?

10:01.184 --> 10:03.519
Well, I was sleeping like a baby
till you called.

10:03.645 --> 10:04.687
Lance, the prison nurse?

10:04.771 --> 10:07.106
Yeah. I thought Dickie
said Dewey was his hostage.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.941
Oh, you're saying Dickie
might be full of shit?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.193
Or Dewey gave Lance the slip.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.658
They say which way he was coming from?

10:23.707 --> 10:27.584
You really think a male nurse gonna go
"Butch and Sundance" in a motel room?

10:27.711 --> 10:29.920
- Just Butch.
- He's a prison nurse.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.881
- What's that mean?
- Means he might know enough law

10:32.966 --> 10:36.135
to realize he's looking at felony murder
for his two dead partners.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.346
You want us to use a ram?

10:41.182 --> 10:42.266
Or...

10:59.617 --> 11:00.826
Lance, you in there?

11:02.287 --> 11:04.413
Looks like we get to use the ram after all.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.582
You're just dying to smash something,
aren't you?

11:15.425 --> 11:19.678
Did any of the witnesses of the carjacking
say Dewey was covered in blood?

11:20.555 --> 11:21.972
Perhaps a little pale?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.975
Looks like somebody's
been killing chickens in here.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.562
Maybe your boy Crowe got the drop on him
and it's the nurse's blood.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.398
Dewey ain't the
"get the drop on anyone" type.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.776
More like the "running around
with his head cut off" type.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.323
- Oh, my God.
- Open the register.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.075
- Okay.
- Move it!

11:41.159 --> 11:42.785
Don't make me hurt you. Come on!

11:51.920 --> 11:54.338
- Where's the rest of it?
- Rest of what?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.799
You heard me, man. I just need the register.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.675
Now, I don't want to hurt you,
but I will if I have to.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.802
Where's the rest of the cash?

12:00.011 --> 12:01.929
I swear all the cash is in the register.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.514
There's like 200 bucks!

12:03.598 --> 12:06.225
All this expensive shit you got here,
there's only 200 bucks?

12:06.309 --> 12:07.434
I'd barely get a blender with that!

12:07.519 --> 12:09.436
Mostly our customers just use credit cards.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.189
The receipts are in the drawer.

12:20.156 --> 12:24.368
Just take something, anything in the store,
and sell it on eBay.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.829
I don't have time for that. I need cash.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.502
Where do people use cash?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.298
He took $229 from the register,

12:38.383 --> 12:41.009
left 50-some-thousand-dollars'
worth of merchandise behind?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.221
Well, he never was
the sharpest apple in the city.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.014
Why did he take so long to start traveling?

12:46.141 --> 12:47.349
I mean, he could have driven
all day yesterday

12:47.434 --> 12:48.976
while we were busy chasing Dickie.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.687
Could have robbed a mattress store
in El Paso this morning

12:51.813 --> 12:53.522
before crossing the damn border.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.318
Well, maybe Lawrence Nightingale
really did take him prisoner.

13:00.029 --> 13:05.492
Get it? Lawrence...
Instead of Florence. Florence Nightingale?

13:06.161 --> 13:08.454
Yeah. I got it.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.168
Oh, Jesus. Not again.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.545
Don't tell me guys pay you by credit card.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.382
I saw some girl on TV say she could
make 3,000 bucks in one night on the pole.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.635
Now, granted, she was a nine-and-a-half,
and you're a six, if I'm feeling generous,

13:23.720 --> 13:25.345
but I figured you'd be good for a grand or so.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.265
- It's 10:00 in the morning.
- Lexington ain't hardly Vegas.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.725
You think I don't know that?

13:33.521 --> 13:35.898
- It's not too late for you, son.
- It's getting there.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.818
Guy said I had maybe six hours
before my skin would start turning color.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.820
First step is admit you need help.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.155
I need money.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.617
Son, drugs are a temporary solution
to a permanent problem.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.160
You think I'm a tweaker?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.120
Learned not to label others lest I be labeled.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.705
Man, you don't know shit.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.041
Do you know you're bleeding?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.309
Now, hold on!

14:12.560 --> 14:14.061
You think this is a joke?

14:14.187 --> 14:16.355
I told him! I told all of you!

14:17.273 --> 14:19.066
I'm a desperate man!

14:25.823 --> 14:28.200
- "Desperate man," huh?
- That's what he said.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.036
- He really bust out of Tramble?
- He had help.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.955
That where he got the transplant?

14:33.039 --> 14:34.831
- I'm sorry?
- The kidneys?

14:35.416 --> 14:36.959
The cuts on his stomach.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.461
He told you they were from a transplant?

14:39.629 --> 14:42.214
No, but when my aunt
had her kidneys swapped out

14:42.298 --> 14:47.010
for a new set from this kid who drowned,
she had cuts in the same places.

14:48.179 --> 14:51.473
Guy matching Crowe's description
just knocked over a Fluff 'n' Fold.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.521
I don't see what good we're doing
just trailing after his mayhem.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.022
You stick with Dewey.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.984
I'm headed to Tyree Medical,
pay a visit to Mr. Ash Murphy.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.112
The prison guard?
What makes you think he knows anything?

15:05.196 --> 15:08.532
He said things might get weird.
I'd say this qualifies.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.209
You never came home.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.338
I just need a little time.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.263
You regret killing him?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.266
I regret that he made it necessary.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.987
I want to show you something.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.500
Still hurts like hell sometimes.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.046
Dickie Bennett's gonna pay for that.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.550
Let me see yours.

16:28.029 --> 16:32.491
We didn't get these working down a mine
or putting a car in a ditch.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.619
This is the price we pay for the life we live.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.955
- I chose this life, Ava.
- So did I.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.959
And whatever you decide,
I'm in it, same as you.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.467
This fella

16:52.303 --> 16:56.598
that put these ideas into Devil's head,
a fella name of Tanner,

16:56.933 --> 17:00.185
I got to decide what to do about him.

17:00.269 --> 17:04.397
Now, Tanner himself, he ain't so much,
but the people he works for,

17:05.400 --> 17:08.734
well, if they decide to come in force,

17:11.364 --> 17:13.990
I don't know that we're gonna be equal to it.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.204
I don't believe that.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.849
What the hell do you want?

17:39.642 --> 17:41.727
Is that any way to greet the man
who saved your life?

17:41.811 --> 17:43.437
You ran me over.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.272
Twice.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.648
Saved me from having to shoot you.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.692
Do you not remember
drawing down on a federal officer?

17:48.776 --> 17:50.736
You did not have to do it a second time.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.155
- You still had the gun in your hand.
- Whatever.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.782
Okay. You know what?
Instead of a thank you,

17:55.908 --> 17:58.493
just tell me what you meant
when you said things might get weird.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.120
You really expect me to help you?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.164
I know that Junior and Coombs got popped,

18:02.498 --> 18:05.417
which means I'm on the hook
for felony murder, right?

18:05.543 --> 18:07.461
Which is a double life sentence.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.089
You really expect me to believe
that you're gonna be able to cut me a deal?

18:11.674 --> 18:13.383
- What is this, morphine?
- Yeah.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.552
You give it to yourself,
what's to stop you from ODing?

18:15.678 --> 18:19.890
Well, if you hit it too many times,
it locks itself out for a bit. Come on.

18:21.809 --> 18:22.934
What do you know about kidneys?

18:23.478 --> 18:25.771
They're the Cadillac of beans. Come on.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.276
Shit! Shit's starting to wear off.
Come on, come on, come on.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.573
Ash, you been futzing with men's organs?

18:38.993 --> 18:40.035
Shit!

18:42.205 --> 18:43.872
It was Lance.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.210
We were gonna strip them for parts.

18:48.377 --> 18:53.381
He said that we'd get 50 grand easy
just for livers and kidneys alone.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.092
He'd been doing it with bodies
at the Tramble morgue.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.137
It wasn't me.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.932
It was him, his idea.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.935
What I want to know now is
who was doing the cutting?

19:05.269 --> 19:06.603
I don't know.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.732
Excuse me. I thought I made myself clear
to the other detectives.

19:11.234 --> 19:15.028
He won't give me my morphine.
He hit me with his car.

19:15.112 --> 19:19.366
He... I told him everything that I know and...

19:21.577 --> 19:23.286
Deputy US Marshal, ma'am.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.831
Well, whoever you are,
this man is my patient.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.250
Well, he's my prisoner.
Don't worry about that.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.001
The machine cuts him off from ODing.

19:30.962 --> 19:34.214
I'm sorry. What is so important
that you would treat him that way?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.509
Do you know what he is, your patient?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.511
Well, I know it's not supposed to matter.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.930
Not to you, either, I believe.

19:43.266 --> 19:46.309
You know, I got a question.
It's a medical one.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.479
Say you took both a guy's kidneys,

19:50.106 --> 19:51.439
then you closed him up.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.776
If you're taking out both his kidneys,
there's no reason to close.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.904
Say you did. You made the two incisions.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.949
You wouldn't have to make incisions
'cause you take the heart and the lungs first,

20:01.033 --> 20:02.534
and you go in for the rest
once the guy's open.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.744
No, I'm not talking about a cadaver
or brain dead.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.624
You're talking about a healthy subject who's
just decided to donate both his kidneys?

20:10.001 --> 20:14.212
Well, say he didn't decide it.
It was decided for him.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.882
In a motel room.
You ever hear of something like that?

20:17.633 --> 20:20.802
- I've heard of Bigfoot, too.
- Yeah, well, he's not my problem.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.096
- You're crazy.
- What?

20:23.222 --> 20:26.391
A surgeon can't go broke out at Keeneland
and get in debt to a shylock?

20:26.475 --> 20:27.559
They bet playing golf.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.853
Yeah? You know any of them
bets more than he can afford?

20:29.937 --> 20:34.065
Well, my money would be on Dr. Boisineau,
but that may just be wishful thinking.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.151
- Boisineau, huh?
- Yeah. He's this young guy.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.154
Always comes out of the OR
thinking he's God, saving lives.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.447
He thinks we should reward him.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.240
He thinks that a nurse's job

20:42.325 --> 20:44.910
is to slap instruments in his hand
and then go to bed with him.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.621
He'll say,
"Hey, come on, I got a room set aside.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.123
"We can make it a quickie or do the other."

20:50.625 --> 20:53.168
I see. But you go for older guys. That it?

20:54.503 --> 20:57.088
Point is you work around Dr. Blow Job,

20:57.173 --> 20:59.674
you learn how to turn him down
without making him angry.

21:00.176 --> 21:04.721
You know where I might be able to find
this Dr. Boisineau?

21:05.306 --> 21:07.432
Well, unless he's got a procedure
scheduled...

21:07.516 --> 21:08.934
Maybe I'll check the empty rooms,

21:09.018 --> 21:11.686
see if he talked anybody
into this, that or the other.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.691
Your man came in the clinic
and said he was bringing me here,

21:17.735 --> 21:19.861
I thought maybe Ms. Crowder took a turn.

21:19.946 --> 21:26.159
No. As a matter of fact, I wanted to thank you
for all the hard work you did patching her up.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.084
She doing her exercises?

21:34.877 --> 21:37.295
I know they're painful,
but she can't let that scar tissue...

21:37.380 --> 21:39.756
I didn't ask you here to talk about Ava,
but, as a matter of fact,

21:39.840 --> 21:41.466
I am glad that you mentioned pain.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.010
Now, being a doctor, people...

21:44.887 --> 21:48.723
People must come to you all the time,
in need of help with their pain.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.475
As a matter of fact,

21:50.559 --> 21:54.646
there are those
who stand to profit from that pain.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.232
And I bet they come, too.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.609
You mean pharmaceutical reps?

21:59.902 --> 22:01.611
You know who I mean.

22:02.697 --> 22:06.533
I ain't angry. I just want to hear you say it.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.079
Frankfort.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.124
What are they offering?

22:14.208 --> 22:15.875
I write them prescriptions.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.378
They offer protection and Oxy.

22:18.462 --> 22:22.090
- Have they delivered any Oxy yet?
- Couple months' worth.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.802
What do you want me to do?

22:26.137 --> 22:28.430
Well, you're a doctor. I want you to sell it.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.225
Sell their Oxy and give you the money?

22:32.810 --> 22:33.893
They'll kill me!

22:33.978 --> 22:36.354
Not if we can put you somewhere
where they can't find you,

22:36.439 --> 22:39.107
like maybe with your mama up in Ewing.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.568
Now, you don't think
they know about her, do you?

22:41.652 --> 22:43.653
I don't see how they could.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.613
Well, now, the way I see this thing,

22:45.698 --> 22:48.658
you're between a rock
and a much, much harder rock.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.452
I do not envy your position.

22:50.619 --> 22:54.247
But you got to think, now,
how would your mama advise you,

22:54.915 --> 22:56.624
if we were sitting in her kitchen,

22:57.376 --> 23:00.211
having this conversation, eating jam cake

23:01.130 --> 23:03.298
at that little fold-out table

23:03.799 --> 23:07.135
just to the right of the back door
that she never locks?

23:13.434 --> 23:14.726
I need directions.

23:17.146 --> 23:21.649
You know, if you put a tablespoon
of nail-polish remover in a cup of water,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.693
that blood will wash right out.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.361
You know where this is?

23:25.446 --> 23:27.322
Yeah. Buckeye Fork.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.325
You going up there into God's country, huh?

23:30.451 --> 23:33.203
I don't need the tourist guide.
I just need to know how to find it.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.122
I'm not sure I like your attitude.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.000
Well, I'm sure I don't give
a good goddamn either way.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.252
Son, I'll ask you not to blaspheme in here.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.171
Listen, you old shit,
I need to find this address.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.714
Now, you gonna help me or not?

23:45.341 --> 23:47.592
Well, let's say not,
and we'll just leave it at that.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.678
Oh, you want to leave it like that, huh?

23:56.477 --> 23:58.103
You see what happens, dumb-ass?

23:58.187 --> 24:00.355
I was just gonna get the directions
and be on my way.

24:01.065 --> 24:03.024
Can't imagine you got much
in this dump worth taking,

24:03.109 --> 24:05.985
but whatever you got,
you can give over just for pissing me off.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.448
Jesus Christ, are you deaf or something?

24:11.075 --> 24:14.202
Son, you've cursed his name twice,
and there's not gonna be a third time.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.037
Got to be about the stupidest...

24:56.912 --> 24:59.914
- Anybody talking to him?
- I tried. LPD is trying now.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.374
He's not talking back.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.586
Usually you got to break his nose
to get him to shut up.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.922
Come on, Dewey.
You're gonna have to talk to me.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.718
We got options here,
but you're gonna have to meet me halfway.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.805
- Owner caught him in the leg, right?
- Yeah.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.225
Any chance he hit something major
and he's just passed out from blood loss?

25:19.393 --> 25:21.853
Nah. I can hear him moving around in there.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.272
You mind giving me a shot?
He kind of likes me.

25:24.398 --> 25:26.608
He's your fugitive. Knock yourself out.

25:26.692 --> 25:30.445
He don't respond soon, though,
we are gonna have to take down the door.

25:33.449 --> 25:34.949
Dewey?

25:36.160 --> 25:38.745
Dewey, it's me, Raylan. Can you hear me?

25:40.080 --> 25:43.124
- You hear that, Raylan?
- Oh, he likes you, all right.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.626
Yeah, I heard it.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.003
Want to make sure you know
I have one in the chamber.

25:47.087 --> 25:50.298
Save you asking if I can rack in a load
before you put a hole through me.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.967
Well, as I understand it,
you already got a couple holes in you.

25:53.928 --> 25:56.054
So, you know about my situation.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.805
Yes, we are all well aware.

25:58.349 --> 26:01.184
These are the end times for Dewey Crowe.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.812
The only choice I have left
is how I punch out,

26:05.689 --> 26:09.901
and I figure a bullet is better than feeling
my body rip itself apart from the inside.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.611
What the hell you talking about?

26:11.737 --> 26:13.863
It's best you not blaspheme in here, Raylan.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.616
Apparently, the owner takes that real serious.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.786
All right, Dewey. Put the goddamn gun down
and get your ass out here.

26:19.870 --> 26:20.995
Too late.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.665
I was supposed to meet
that son-of-a-bitch nurse an hour ago.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.167
Shop owner gave us the address.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.419
I bet my skin's changing color, too.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.672
Listen, Dewey. As I understand it,

26:31.006 --> 26:33.800
dying of kidney failure,
aside from some nausea,

26:33.884 --> 26:35.301
is pretty much like falling asleep.

26:35.386 --> 26:37.178
- Who told you that?
- A doctor.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.681
I was at a hospital not 30 minutes ago.

26:41.684 --> 26:45.311
Well, Lance told me my whole body would
clench so hard, my bones would break.

26:45.396 --> 26:48.856
Well, Lance sounds like a goddamn liar.
Have you been pissing?

26:48.941 --> 26:51.192
He took my kidneys, Raylan, not my dick.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.528
Your kidneys are for pissing.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.865
So why don't you try taking a leak,
and if you can do it,

26:57.950 --> 26:59.784
then we know you still got your two kidneys.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.392
Come on, come on.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.480
Holy shit.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.401
You mean I had four kidneys?

27:37.031 --> 27:38.656
God bless you, son.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.076
The address was an abandoned warehouse.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.412
- No sign of Lance?
- No sign of him.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.664
Could have taken off
when Dewey missed his deadline,

27:46.749 --> 27:49.959
or maybe he was watching from somewhere
when KSP rolled up.

27:50.627 --> 27:55.465
One last thing. Ash Murphy,
how did he seem when you left him?

27:55.799 --> 27:57.925
He was in a little bit of pain.
Nothing he don't deserve.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.594
Why? How's he seem now?

27:59.887 --> 28:01.554
- He died of a stroke.
- Dead?

28:02.431 --> 28:04.098
Stroke's always a worry post-surgery,

28:04.183 --> 28:06.100
especially with the amount of trauma
his body had been through.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.644
- He have any visitors?
- Just you.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.021
Yeah, but doctors?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.981
The orthos saw him on their morning rounds.

28:12.066 --> 28:16.110
Yeah, but what about...
Was it this Dr. Boisineau, maybe?

28:18.072 --> 28:20.073
Isn't he a transplant surgeon?

28:20.824 --> 28:22.367
I hear y'all call him Dr...

28:25.704 --> 28:28.706
- Where's the other nurse? Layla?
- Layla?

28:28.832 --> 28:32.418
Yeah, I talked to her this morning.
Local girl. Cute as a pailful of kittens.

29:31.353 --> 29:34.689
Well, it looks like
we have a friend in common.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.444
Or, better yet, we had a friend in common.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.487
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

29:42.990 --> 29:46.367
Now, can I trust you to relay that information
to the man you work for?

29:49.204 --> 29:50.997
There's a message that goes along with it.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.124
Yeah? What's the message?

29:55.127 --> 29:56.669
Jesus!

30:00.841 --> 30:04.302
Now, you tell your boss
if he has anything to say in reply,

30:04.970 --> 30:07.054
I'll be at my cousin Johnny's bar.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.352
Just down the road they got two-for-ones
on Wednesday and Thursday,

30:13.770 --> 30:15.563
if you want to gimp on over.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.949
Oh, nice to see you again, Deputy.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.202
You mind if I come in, ma'am?

30:29.745 --> 30:32.246
Layla. And I'd mind if you didn't.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.668
Your phone was off,
so I figured I'd just come over

30:37.753 --> 30:39.921
and push your buzzer till you answer.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.715
Well, I always turn off my phone
when I've been working doubles.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.675
Must be exhausted,

30:44.760 --> 30:46.844
especially since you also work
at the transplant center.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.471
You didn't tell me that.

30:49.473 --> 30:50.932
Well, you didn't ask.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.601
Just started working the ICU
in the last 24 hours,

30:53.685 --> 30:56.604
right after Ash Murphy checked in.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.481
I'll tell you something.

30:58.565 --> 31:02.652
A person with a suspicious mind might think
you had something to do with something.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.489
- You want a drink?
- I'd love one.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.247
You didn't work yesterday, though, did you?

31:14.665 --> 31:17.542
Were you out with your boyfriend?

31:18.293 --> 31:21.003
What makes you think I have a boyfriend?

31:21.630 --> 31:24.674
I'd like to talk to him,
just so I can get him to vouch for you.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.720
What's that? He married?

31:31.223 --> 31:33.849
Honey, I start arresting people
for committing adultery,

31:33.934 --> 31:35.810
I'd never make it home for supper.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.019
Wow.

31:37.854 --> 31:41.983
Your imagination
has me doing some nasty things.

31:42.568 --> 31:46.821
And, you know, you haven't even mentioned
how I gave Ash that stroke this afternoon.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.323
- No, how did you do that?
- How did I do that?

31:49.950 --> 31:53.953
Did I inject an air bubble into his brain
or is that just another urban legend?

31:54.037 --> 31:55.538
Like Bigfoot?

31:55.664 --> 31:57.832
Or stealing kidneys in motel rooms.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.505
Layla?

32:04.590 --> 32:06.841
Have you been stealing kidneys
in motel rooms?

32:07.593 --> 32:09.719
If I said no, would you believe me?

32:20.397 --> 32:21.939
What the hell else was I supposed to do?

32:22.024 --> 32:26.944
You didn't have to do anything except
stay hidden while I talked him out of it.

32:27.696 --> 32:28.863
What if you couldn't have?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.699
Well, then I'd have given him
the needle myself.

32:34.995 --> 32:39.206
Did you at least have a plan for what
you were gonna do after you stuck him?

32:41.251 --> 32:43.419
Cut him up and sell him for parts.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.588
You want to take his kidneys?

32:45.714 --> 32:48.799
- Why not? We got to kill him anyway, right?
- Oh, yeah, well, thanks to you.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.468
Look, the point is,

32:50.552 --> 32:52.720
we might as well make ourselves
a little traveling money

32:52.804 --> 32:54.138
while we're at it, right?

32:54.222 --> 32:57.058
- It's not like this is our first time.
- We're in my house.

33:01.772 --> 33:04.774
All right, well, at least put him in the tub.
Keep from getting blood on my floor.

33:05.067 --> 33:06.400
There you go.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.319
Hey, you want to...

33:08.403 --> 33:09.862
You want to give me a hand here or no?

33:09.946 --> 33:13.491
I got to get another syringe ready
'cause that one's gonna wear off.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.394
- Look at me.
- Kind of got my hands full, honey.

33:41.478 --> 33:44.271
Well, set him down a sec.
It's not like he's going anywhere.

33:44.606 --> 33:46.107
I want you to look at me.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.609
What is it?

33:57.786 --> 33:59.370
It's a real shame, Marshal.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.957
Something tells me we could have had fun.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.803
I can't believe you shot me.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.973
I can't believe it either.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.106
So, she shot him.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.275
You shot her through him. Is that right?

34:30.360 --> 34:33.320
If you say so. It's all a bit foggy to me.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.489
Deep breath. Slow.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.241
That's pretty impressive,

34:37.324 --> 34:40.161
considering they had you
full of enough tranqs to stop a rhino.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.580
- She gonna make it?
- Jury's still out.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.125
Pressure and respiration are both normal.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.501
Probably be hung over
for the next day or two,

34:47.627 --> 34:49.170
but otherwise, you're good to go.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.172
Thank you, sir.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.217
You all right?

34:56.636 --> 34:58.679
She was surprised.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.056
When I shot her.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.934
She was pointing a gun at you.
What did she think you were gonna do?

35:04.019 --> 35:05.519
I was surprised, too.

35:06.354 --> 35:10.191
- 'Cause you never shot a woman before?
- I guess.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.033
The infamous Boyd Crowder.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.285
Feel free.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.205
- Hey, Jimmy, did he come alone?
- Far as I could tell.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.875
He's clean.

35:28.084 --> 35:31.128
Would you be so kind as to offer me
a bourbon? Pappy family.

35:31.213 --> 35:34.507
Well, Mr. Quarles,
I can see that you got my message.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.258
Yes. Both of them.

35:36.343 --> 35:39.053
Well, that's funny. I thought I only sent one.

35:39.346 --> 35:43.766
Well, no. You assaulted one of my employees
and then you appropriated my product.

35:43.850 --> 35:44.975
I make that two.

35:45.060 --> 35:48.145
Well, now, taking the pills,
that wasn't a message.

35:48.230 --> 35:52.024
That was just me assessing you a fine
for sowing the seeds of mutiny.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.693
Why don't we just split the difference?
Call it a gift.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.781
To mark the launch
of our new business venture. Thank you.

35:58.865 --> 36:03.661
Well, if you wanted to be my partner,
why didn't you come to me directly?

36:03.745 --> 36:07.331
Call it a speed bump on the road
to cross-cultural understanding.

36:07.415 --> 36:10.334
The most important thing is I'm here now.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.838
Boyd, have you heard the saying,

36:13.922 --> 36:17.591
"The most successful war
seldom pays for its losses"?

36:18.677 --> 36:20.010
Thomas Jefferson.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.557
Prison doesn't offer much,
but it does give a man ample time to read.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.559
Amongst other things, I'm sure.

36:28.562 --> 36:29.812
Bottom line, Boyd.

36:30.272 --> 36:33.691
You and I'd make a lot more money
as partners than as enemies.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.777
That can't come as news to an educated man.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.282
Mr. Quarles,
have you heard the term "carpetbagger"?

36:41.741 --> 36:43.784
It was coined during Reconstruction.

36:43.910 --> 36:47.204
A man from the North
comes down to the South

36:47.289 --> 36:51.000
to take advantage of our backward ways.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.627
Yes, I'm familiar
with the term "carpetbagger."

36:53.712 --> 36:57.047
Well, then you know to a carpetbagger,
"partners" just means that,

36:57.132 --> 37:00.467
well, we do all the work
while you make all the money.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.719
Amen to that.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.688
Thank you for the bourbon.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.484
Mr. Quarles, there's one more thing.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.780
Carpetbaggers in three-piece suits
have been coming to Harlan for a long time.

37:21.865 --> 37:26.076
They have a habit of dying off
like deer flies at the end of summer.

37:28.330 --> 37:29.413
Saul Bellow.

37:34.085 --> 37:38.213
You're a smart man, Mr. Quarles. Smart man.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.843
Can't tell you how well I sleep

37:42.928 --> 37:47.264
knowing that you were out there,
my eyes and my ears.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.810
Yep. From what you done told me,
I'd say that

37:51.895 --> 37:54.480
Mr. Quarles tried to pull a fast one
on Boyd Crowder

37:54.564 --> 37:56.357
and ended up getting his hand slapped.

37:56.691 --> 38:00.110
Well, like I told Mr. Errol,
it was Tanner who took the beating.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.696
Yeah, but you heard Boyd Crowder tell him

38:02.864 --> 38:05.866
this was a message for his boss,
meaning Mr. Quarles?

38:10.538 --> 38:16.460
Did Tanner say what he thought
Mr. Quarles' intentions might be?

38:17.045 --> 38:19.797
Just that he's some water-walking badman
from Detroit,

38:19.881 --> 38:22.800
come down here to get things running right,
like they used to.

38:24.886 --> 38:30.933
You know, if I didn't know better,
I'd say Tanner got himself a little old crush.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.981
Mighty fine work, girl.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.108
Mighty fine.

38:40.110 --> 38:43.570
Now, you keep your ear to the ground,

38:44.155 --> 38:48.617
and remember I'm counting on you.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.463
You remember that guy in New Jersey,
had that crematorium?

39:02.549 --> 39:04.174
Funeral director.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.595
Finish the service,
and then he'd call in his cutters,

39:09.347 --> 39:11.974
and they'd harvest everything
out of the body that was worth anything,

39:12.100 --> 39:14.977
and they'd throw the rest
of it in the incinerator.

39:17.439 --> 39:20.816
And the human body, when you sell it
on the black market like that,

39:22.902 --> 39:25.279
I mean, you're talking about
a quarter of a million dollars.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.741
I think this was more of
a mom-and-pop operation.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.994
I'm just thinking that might be
where they got the idea.

39:32.829 --> 39:36.790
I'll tell you an idea I had sitting in the tub,
waiting to be cut open.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.626
I should find another line of work.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.631
- Give that a day or two.
- I'm serious, Art.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.050
Nah, that'll pass.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.931
What? Winona on your ass about it?

39:54.350 --> 39:55.726
No.

39:55.977 --> 39:58.729
No, she seems fine with the way things are.

40:01.483 --> 40:03.275
She's a special lady.
