WEBVTT

00:06.965 --> 00:12.137
[soft tense music]

00:12.178 --> 00:14.055
- We need to talk.

00:16.224 --> 00:19.477
Nate told me you sprung a leak?

00:19.519 --> 00:21.146
- Uh...

00:21.187 --> 00:23.189
we don't--we don't have a leak.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.608
- Yeah, he said
it was the new pipe I put in.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.027
I can't have that.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.739
* *

00:30.780 --> 00:32.115
I insist.

00:32.157 --> 00:35.035
I gotta stand
behind my work, you know?

00:35.076 --> 00:37.370
One bad Yelp review,
and I'm canceled.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.289
Not that you'd ever do that,
but, you know,

00:39.330 --> 00:41.583
it's the principle.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.710
After you.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.713
[clock ticking]

00:46.755 --> 00:53.678
* *

01:09.778 --> 01:11.780
Okay.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.242
Let's see what we got
going on in here.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.748
So, uh, how's work, huh?

01:21.790 --> 01:24.542
How's the market?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.294
- Yeah, you know, it's good.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.963
It's, uh--everyone's
always looking for a bargain.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.674
So it's...
- Yeah.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.092
- Tough.

01:32.133 --> 01:36.471
* *

01:36.513 --> 01:40.058
- Ah, here it is.
Yeah, there is a leak.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.894
So strange he didn't tell you.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.271
- Well, it's not really--

01:45.313 --> 01:47.816
- You know, in my experience,

01:47.857 --> 01:49.818
husbands don't keep
that many things secret

01:49.859 --> 01:51.027
from their wives.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.779
You know?
- Hmm.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.239
- Right?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.241
You guys tell
each other everything

01:56.282 --> 01:58.410
till death do you part.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.871
Hey, Ava?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.336
How long do you want me
to keep this up?

02:09.629 --> 02:12.173
- Wh-what?

02:12.215 --> 02:15.719
- You're really gonna make me
keep looking for the fake leak?

02:15.760 --> 02:21.975
* *

02:22.017 --> 02:24.686
So...

02:27.355 --> 02:29.941
Here's what I think happened.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.195
I think you figured out
the whole thing...

02:36.364 --> 02:39.701
The booties, the scratches,

02:39.743 --> 02:42.996
Pomona, all of it.

02:43.038 --> 02:46.958
There's no way our sweet Nathan
put all that together himself.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.669
He's not wired like us.

02:51.463 --> 02:55.258
I think you came up
with this...podcast.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.764
- No idea
what you're talking about.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.477
- Mm-kay.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.229
Here's what I'm gonna do...

03:11.316 --> 03:13.026
- [gasps]

03:13.068 --> 03:19.282
* *

03:19.324 --> 03:23.370
I'm gonna give you...
one more chance

03:23.411 --> 03:24.662
to tell me the truth.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.248
'Cause if this is gonna work,

03:27.290 --> 03:30.251
if we're gonna move forward
as partners,

03:30.293 --> 03:34.172
there's gotta be trust,
am I right?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.800
So what's it gonna be?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.554
- This is Ava.
Leave a message.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.223
[phone beeps]
- Hey, it's me again.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.933
Just call me
when you get this, okay?

03:44.974 --> 03:46.393
He's still not here.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.894
I don't know where you are.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.854
Just--just call me.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.315
[pounding on door]

03:53.942 --> 03:55.360
[doorbell buzzes]

03:58.321 --> 03:59.656
You're late.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.366
- Yeah. I brought a friend.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.327
[dramatic music]

04:04.369 --> 04:10.917
* *

04:10.959 --> 04:12.419
- [clears throat]

04:12.460 --> 04:15.422
[suspenseful music]

04:15.463 --> 04:19.926
* *

04:19.968 --> 04:22.595
Okay, so let's be clear,

04:22.637 --> 04:25.765
if we are gonna do this,
no more lies.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.019
One of us goes down,
we all go down.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.856
And this location?

04:32.897 --> 04:33.815
Amateur hour.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.608
You got one exit,
no escape route,

04:35.650 --> 04:37.485
and it's way too loud.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.448
- I don't--
I don't hear anything.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.449
- Mm-mm.
- Do you?

04:42.490 --> 04:43.575
- Mm-mm.
- Oh.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.868
Do you wanna know what I hear?

04:44.909 --> 04:46.453
- Sure.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.580
- The train station
100 feet away.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.081
The couple talking shit
about the traffic.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.458
[car horn honks]
The meth head mumbling

04:51.499 --> 04:52.834
at the dumpster.

04:52.876 --> 04:56.463
What if just one of them
mentions a street name?

04:56.504 --> 04:59.466
Every single second
of this podcast

04:59.507 --> 05:02.886
is gonna be studied, enhanced.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.763
The cops
are gonna hear everything.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.974
The SWAT team will be here
in 60 seconds.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.561
You guys wanna play murder,
you don't half-ass it.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.604
- Mm-mm.
- of course.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.148
- From now on, we use burners.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.316
- Burners?

05:16.358 --> 05:17.567
- Uh...
- Burners.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.319
All right, kids...

05:19.361 --> 05:20.612
rest of today's canceled.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.490
I'll find us a new location.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.493
Oh, hey,
and just a little heads-up,

05:26.534 --> 05:29.245
your friends came to see me.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.747
You know, the LAPD?

05:30.789 --> 05:32.832
- What?
- It's all good.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.001
I gave them my alibi.
They took off.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.628
- What alibi?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.589
- You know, after the bar,
we went back to your house.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.883
We got fucked up
and watched "Face/Off."

05:41.925 --> 05:43.385
- I'm your alibi?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.512
No, they're--
they're gonna ask me.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.180
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Yeah.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.556
They are gonna ask you.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.184
But we're partners now, right?

05:51.226 --> 05:52.936
Buddy?

05:52.977 --> 05:55.814
You watch my back...

05:55.855 --> 05:58.191
and I won't stick
a knife in yours.

05:58.233 --> 06:05.156
* *

06:12.080 --> 06:15.000
- [grunting]

06:17.377 --> 06:19.337
- God, Ava...
- [panting]

06:19.379 --> 06:20.922
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.924
- Girl's got some rage
in her today.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.301
- Tough day, uh-huh.
- I like it.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.845
Let's go.
- Okay, you ready, baby?

06:26.886 --> 06:28.513
- [groans]
- Oh, I'm ready.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.016
There we go, there we go.
[grunts]

06:31.057 --> 06:33.393
Nice! Yeah, baby.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.936
Give it to me hard.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.104
- [grunting]
- Harder, harder...

06:36.146 --> 06:36.938
- [moans]
- Harder!

06:36.980 --> 06:38.773
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

06:38.815 --> 06:40.108
[sighs]
- Look how wet we are.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.359
- Oh, my God.
You always get me wet...

06:41.401 --> 06:42.819
- You're a little wet.
- One way or another.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.070
- [chuckles]
- [moans]

06:44.112 --> 06:45.613
- Ooh, that feels nice,
doesn't it?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.907
- Mm. [chuckles]
- It's hot.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.784
- Stop.
[both chuckle]

06:49.826 --> 06:51.202
- I'm gonna get you
some electrolytes, okay?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.329
- Okay, thank you, baby.
- Ava, electrolytes?

06:53.371 --> 06:55.457
- Yeah...
- All right.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.792
- [sighs]
- Wow.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.463
You guys have some
insane chemistry there.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.006
- You have no idea.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.841
- Well...
- So speaking of...

07:04.883 --> 07:06.676
[sighs]
I don't know.

07:06.718 --> 07:10.013
You and Nathan have had some
weird-ass energy lately.

07:10.055 --> 07:13.058
- Nathan and I are just going
through some stuff.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.517
It's fine.
- What, like you're--

07:14.559 --> 07:15.727
- We're totally fine.
We really are.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.687
- Okay.
- Yeah.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.522
- Well, I have something
that might cheer you up.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.358
- Hmm?
- "Sisters In Crime."

07:21.399 --> 07:22.776
New season.
- Really?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.527
- Just announced.
Dropping Friday.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.738
It's all
about the Westside Ripper.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.658
[uneasy music]

07:30.700 --> 07:32.285
- "Sisters In Crime" is huge.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.162
If we don't get out
before then, we are fucked.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.956
I don't want all of
our sacrifices to go to waste

07:36.998 --> 07:39.793
because of the fucking
Lipinski sisters.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.671
We gotta fast-track this,
and now.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.339
God, I hate using this phone.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.882
It makes me feel
like a criminal.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.884
- Yeah, well, at least
you're not his alibi.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.261
I mean, I don't wanna lie
for a serial killer.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.971
I just--I don't wanna do that.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.848
- Listen, we'll deal with it
when we have to--if we have to.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.266
Maybe they won't
even follow up.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.810
[phone chimes]

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
Oh, wait.
Look, he's ready.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.314
He found a place for tomorrow.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.149
- What kind of place?

08:03.191 --> 08:07.195
* *

08:07.237 --> 08:08.780
How'd you find this?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.782
- I installed a toilet here.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.535
The Toto UltraMax single flush.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.286
It's a nice couple.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.163
They're in Mykonos, I think.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.624
They're in fashion.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.084
- [whispering]
Stop, stop.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.377
Don't do that.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.878
[keypad beeping]

08:23.920 --> 08:26.464
They gave you the code?
- Eh, don't ask.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.383
[garage door creaks]

08:28.425 --> 08:35.557
* *

08:36.266 --> 08:38.351
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, no one's gonna bug us.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.520
We're good.

08:40.562 --> 08:43.064
- Wow. Um, okay, that's great.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.190
This is good.
- It's so clean.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.650
- So we should probably--
we gotta move

08:45.692 --> 08:47.027
because we only have
a few days.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.404
- Guys, guys, I don't care
about "Sisters In Crime."

08:49.446 --> 08:50.697
All right? They're hacks.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.407
The audience is gonna smell it
a mile away.

08:52.449 --> 08:56.244
We don't need to be first.
We just need to be better.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.620
All right.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.372
[clears throat]
- Um...

08:59.414 --> 09:01.207
where's my gear?

09:01.249 --> 09:02.250
- Oh, I upgraded.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.918
Look, you guys wanna
half-ass this

09:03.960 --> 09:05.712
like everything else you do,
that's fine.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.840
Me, when I do something,
I wanna do it properly.

09:08.882 --> 09:13.261
So before we start,
let's talk marketing.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.306
Like, if we can't reveal
who we are,

09:16.348 --> 09:17.640
how do we sell this?

09:17.682 --> 09:19.267
- Well, you know,
no one ever went broke

09:19.309 --> 09:21.603
betting on America's obsession
with murder, so...

09:21.644 --> 09:24.397
plus we have
a really good title.

09:24.439 --> 09:28.443
It's "Interview
with a Serial Killer."

09:28.485 --> 09:30.111
- Boom.
- Oh.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.279
- She--that was her.
- [chuckles]

09:31.321 --> 09:32.864
- Yeah.
- It was--it was great.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.240
- Okay, but guys?

09:34.282 --> 09:37.160
I actually had
a really exciting idea on that.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.329
What about...

09:39.371 --> 09:41.122
"Based on a True Story"?

09:41.164 --> 09:43.500
- [clicks tongue]
- People love that shit.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.461
It could be the ultimate
true crime podcast, all right?

09:46.503 --> 09:48.922
And we could even make
a universe out of it.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.298
- A what?
- A universe.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.592
Like,
"Based on a True Story: Miami,"

09:52.634 --> 09:53.843
"Based on a True Story:
Atlanta."

09:53.885 --> 09:56.012
Just like the housewives.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.138
- Wow.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.015
- We do a serial killer
in each city.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.850
- You know,
here's what I think.

10:00.892 --> 10:04.396
Maybe we just try and,
like, master this first

10:04.437 --> 10:07.148
before we start talkin'
spin-offs and, you know...

10:07.190 --> 10:08.650
- Okay, yeah.
But you know what?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.402
For later, we could, uh--

10:10.443 --> 10:12.570
we could do something
really cool with the subtitle.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.116
"Based on a True Story:
The Westside Ripper Speaks."

10:16.157 --> 10:17.826
You know, just, like,
uh, I don't know,

10:17.867 --> 10:19.953
"Top Gun: Maverick."

10:19.994 --> 10:21.246
- Yeah, no, it's--

10:21.287 --> 10:23.832
it's totally like
"Top Gun: Maverick."

10:23.873 --> 10:25.667
- Great, okay.
Well, look, let's sit.

10:25.709 --> 10:26.835
[clears throat]

10:26.876 --> 10:28.086
- We're gonna use
a voice filter.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.587
We'll add that in.
- Okay.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.173
And, uh, who do we say you are?

10:32.215 --> 10:33.967
I mean,
you're interviewing me, right?

10:34.009 --> 10:37.429
- We're not gonna reveal
who we are or how we know you.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.555
That's part of the sell.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.681
We're gonna give details
each week

10:39.723 --> 10:41.975
only the killer knows.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.727
Um, and, you know,

10:43.768 --> 10:45.395
it's gonna create
a lot of buzz.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.689
People are gonna go crazy
for more info.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.691
- Yeah, okay.
Great, great.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.901
[inhales deeply]

10:51.943 --> 10:53.319
Let's do this.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.322
- [clears throat]

10:58.116 --> 10:59.200
- [sighs]

10:59.242 --> 11:00.869
- Let's start
from the beginning.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.328
- Recording.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.290
[eerie music]

11:05.331 --> 11:08.376
* *

11:08.418 --> 11:10.295
- Who are you?

11:10.337 --> 11:13.048
* *

11:13.089 --> 11:15.884
- I'm the Westside Ripper.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.802
I've killed seven women

11:17.844 --> 11:21.639
that the police are aware of...

11:21.681 --> 11:23.892
and at least 20 more.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.895
[dramatic music]

11:26.936 --> 11:31.107
* *

11:31.149 --> 11:34.569
I was so young. 18.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.780
She was my first.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.199
But from that day on,
I just...

11:39.240 --> 11:41.534
fell in love with it.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.288
- That's fuckin' nuts.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.456
- I know. It is.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.665
The planning, the details.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.168
No wonder
why no one can catch him.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.754
- You really think
there's 20 more bodies?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.339
- God, I don't know.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.633
All these creeps have,
like, a weird competition

11:56.675 --> 11:57.967
with each other, you know?

11:58.009 --> 12:00.178
They wanna be
in the Bundy Club, 30 plus.

12:01.763 --> 12:02.972
I think
people are gonna go nuts

12:03.014 --> 12:05.350
when they hear this.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.310
- Yeah.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.992
- Hey.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.871
- Hey, what are you doing here?
You can't come here.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.456
- Well, if you answered
your texts,

12:28.498 --> 12:29.916
then I wouldn't have
to be here.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.626
And I had to put my kid
in the Fun Zone

12:31.668 --> 12:34.295
just so me and you could have
a little talk.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.506
- Okay.
What are we talkin' about?

12:36.548 --> 12:38.883
- I got some exciting news.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.301
I made a new cut.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.053
- A new what?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.930
- A new cut of the podcast.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.515
- You made your own cut?

12:45.557 --> 12:46.474
- I listened to yours,

12:46.516 --> 12:49.436
and, honestly...
I didn't love it.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.396
- Really?
We think it's really great.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.356
- The ending just doesn't work,
all right?

12:53.398 --> 12:54.441
Or the beginning.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.026
And Uncle Stan?
That music--

12:56.067 --> 12:59.320
look, it just doesn't sound
authentic.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.115
- Okay.
Um, I gotta tell you,

13:02.157 --> 13:04.200
we've done tons of research.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.703
And we're listened to hundreds
of true crime--

13:06.745 --> 13:09.247
- Yeah, but have you ever
actually killed anyone?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.415
- Are you fucking kidding me?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.875
You can't come
to the Beverly Club

13:11.916 --> 13:13.335
and talk about killing people.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.587
- You don't have
any lived experience.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.838
- [sighs]
- All right?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.089
It just doesn't feel real.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.424
- Let me tell you something.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.886
We know what we're doing,
and you need to trust us.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.512
- Why?

13:24.554 --> 13:26.806
- Yeah, why?
Why do I need to trust you?

13:26.848 --> 13:28.016
This is my story.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.185
I'm trying to protect my brand.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.020
And you keep wasting time

13:32.062 --> 13:33.146
cutting
to these other characters.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.773
- They're good characters.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.857
- Nobody cares.
- Okay.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.150
- You know
what they do care about?

13:37.192 --> 13:39.486
Me. They care about me.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.862
Anytime you cut away
to the cops

13:40.904 --> 13:42.030
or the victim's family,

13:42.072 --> 13:43.239
they're just gonna fast-forward

13:43.281 --> 13:45.033
till they get
to the serial killer shit.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.452
So let's just...
just give 'em what they want.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.163
- You don't have final cut
of the podcast.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.499
Do you understand that?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.000
- I'm gonna send it to you,
all right?

13:54.042 --> 13:55.085
Just take a listen.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.711
It's all a discussion.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.380
I hope Ava loves it.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.423
Oh, and Nathan?
- Yeah.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.051
- You missed one.

14:03.093 --> 14:10.225
* *

14:12.936 --> 14:14.187
- Petrificus Totalus!

14:14.229 --> 14:16.439
- Tarantallegra!
- Wingardium Leviosa!

14:16.481 --> 14:19.317
- Tarantallegra!
- Petrificus Totalus!

14:19.359 --> 14:21.236
- Flipendo!

14:21.277 --> 14:22.946
- Hey, Ollie.
Ready to go?

14:22.987 --> 14:24.781
- Please? Five more minutes.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.575
- Aw, buddy.
- This is my new friend, Gabby.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.910
- Oh, hey, Gabby.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.246
I, uh--hey, I got
something for you.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.373
- This a spoon?
Expelliarmus!

14:33.415 --> 14:36.209
- Flipendo!
- Oh, you got me!

14:36.251 --> 14:38.253
- [giggles]
- [moans]

14:38.294 --> 14:41.089
- Can we have a playdate?

14:41.131 --> 14:42.298
- Gabby, you ready to go?

14:42.340 --> 14:44.050
- Mom, we're gonna have
a playdate!

14:44.092 --> 14:45.719
- Are we now?

14:45.760 --> 14:46.928
- Uh, hi.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.304
- Hi.
- Hey. [chuckles]

14:48.346 --> 14:49.931
- That was a really good fall.

14:49.973 --> 14:50.974
- Yeah, I've been practicing.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.393
- I'm Michelle.
- Matt.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.061
Great to meet you, Michelle.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.104
- Nice to meet you.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.147
- Can we, Dad?
- Can we, Mom?

14:57.188 --> 14:58.523
Please?
- Can we?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.567
- I guess
we don't have a choice.

15:00.608 --> 15:01.860
- Yes.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.486
- We have no choice. Yes.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.743
- The first time I did it,

15:09.784 --> 15:11.870
I went home covered in blood,
my heart beating like crazy.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.204
I was sure the police

15:13.246 --> 15:15.081
would come knocking
on my door,

15:15.123 --> 15:17.667
but no one came.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.670
[soft tense music]

15:20.712 --> 15:23.465
* *

15:23.506 --> 15:26.051
- God, I keep wondering...

15:27.969 --> 15:29.721
Is it really 20?

15:31.681 --> 15:33.516
- Give or take.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.480
- How do you not remember?

15:38.521 --> 15:40.732
- You can always turn me in.

15:40.774 --> 15:45.236
One phone call,
and all of this ends.

15:45.278 --> 15:50.492
* *

15:50.533 --> 15:53.370
- I mean, I'm not forcing
anyone to buy it.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.871
People don't have to listen.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.206
- Of course.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.999
- There are a hundred podcasts
just like it.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.709
- Absolutely.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.466
- Was it really more than 20?

16:06.508 --> 16:08.176
- [sighs]

16:08.218 --> 16:10.387
You know what I think?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.597
You need to take the edge off.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.773
Can I suggest something?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.942
[liquid pouring]

16:23.983 --> 16:26.152
Why don't you...

16:27.487 --> 16:30.156
Why don't you talk
to Nathan about it, you know?

16:30.198 --> 16:33.243
Just--just tell him
how you feel.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.079
- [sighs] I can't.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.289
He's not like us, you know?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.708
I mean, he wouldn't
even raise his prices

16:39.749 --> 16:42.836
when we couldn't afford
the mortgage.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.295
That was the day I realized

16:44.337 --> 16:47.382
that the world
was gonna eat this guy alive.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.135
If he sees I'm having
doubts about this, he'll--

16:50.176 --> 16:51.803
he'll completely collapse.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.471
Like, this will all be over.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.850
- You need
to be strong for him.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.184
- I can't fail.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.978
I mean,
it's not just us anymore.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.771
- I can help you.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.859
- How are you gonna help me?

17:08.611 --> 17:09.863
[gasps]

17:09.904 --> 17:15.952
* *

17:15.994 --> 17:19.205
- Babe?

17:19.247 --> 17:21.249
Babe?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.752
Hey, babe.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.132
- Mm, yeah. Hey.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.467
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.970
- Okay.
So Matt did his own cut.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.305
- He what?

17:35.347 --> 17:38.016
- He didn't feel
it was authentic.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.226
- [sighs]
Okay, what did he change?

17:40.268 --> 17:41.895
- I listened.
It's--it's--

17:41.936 --> 17:43.396
it's just mostly dialogue,

17:43.438 --> 17:45.273
and he did add some new music.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.317
He put Uncle Stan back in,

17:47.359 --> 17:48.943
changed the ending,
changed the beginning--

17:48.985 --> 17:50.195
- What the fuck?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.488
That's
an entirely different version.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.156
- To be fair,
some of the changes

17:53.198 --> 17:54.491
sounded kind of good.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.326
Like, the music--
- Oh, fuck this guy.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.535
If we give up control now,

17:57.577 --> 17:58.995
we are never getting it back.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.372
Okay? We hold the cards.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.956
- We hold the cards?

18:01.998 --> 18:05.210
Just listen to it and--okay?

18:05.251 --> 18:06.419
And see what you think.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.380
- Fuck, fine.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.132
But I'm taking notes
and making my own changes.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.093
[groans]

18:13.134 --> 18:15.053
- [sighs]

18:15.095 --> 18:16.513
Thanks for coming.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.307
I can't wait to hear
what you guys think.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.684
both: Hey.
- Hey.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.143
- Yes.
- Yes, do you want to, uh...

18:22.185 --> 18:23.228
- Yep.
- Start?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.563
- Listen, your new work
is great.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.357
- Aw.
- Yeah.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.526
The dialogue really pops.
- Yeah.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.653
- Um, the new ending
is actually really good.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.071
- It's better, right?
I told you.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.280
- It's--it's--

18:34.322 --> 18:36.032
- We got the emotion
back in there.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.117
- Yes.
- Yeah.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.118
- Mm-hmm?
- We just, like--

18:38.159 --> 18:39.619
we just have a few notes.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.371
- Yeah, sure, of course.
It's all a discussion.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.372
- Okay.
- So, uh, yeah.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.373
- Terrific.
- Hit me.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.416
- Awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.875
- So the first one, Uncle Stan.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.128
I think we can just end
with him at the carnival.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.005
I don't think we need to go
to the gelato store.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.216
- Yeah, it's just--it's
about my emotional journey,

18:53.258 --> 18:55.093
the highs, the lows.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.594
It's very moving.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.513
- Honestly,
does it really matter

18:58.555 --> 19:00.765
if Uncle Stan got you
a chocolate cone

19:00.807 --> 19:01.850
or a waffle cone?

19:01.891 --> 19:04.394
I don't think
anyone's gonna care.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.396
- You know,
I really know this genre.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.189
Like, I--trust me.
- She knows it.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.649
- Can I ask
you guys a question?

19:09.691 --> 19:11.735
- Mm-hmm.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.194
- Do you want this to just be

19:13.236 --> 19:15.030
like every other
dead white girl podcast,

19:15.071 --> 19:16.823
just about the body count?

19:16.865 --> 19:18.908
We are better than that.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.619
What I'm trying to do here
is drag you

19:21.661 --> 19:23.997
out of your Mar Vista,
chicken Caesar comfort zone

19:24.039 --> 19:26.875
and embrace
something truly visionary.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.294
All right?
Let's ask the big questions.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.922
Who's worse, the guy that puts
the bolt in the cow's skull,

19:32.964 --> 19:34.382
guilty,

19:34.424 --> 19:39.637
or the people that sit
around a restaurant and eat it?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.391
- I just--

19:43.433 --> 19:45.101
I don't think we need
to get into that.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.270
I think people
might just tap the fuck out.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.438
- You know,
all I'm trying to do

19:48.480 --> 19:50.357
is just elevate
the material, okay?

19:50.398 --> 19:53.526
So, uh, yeah.
Any more notes?

19:55.236 --> 19:56.654
- Actually, yes.
- Yeah, we do.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.366
Um, one more.
And this one we can't budge on.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.701
We gotta cut your last line,
"Who's next?"

20:01.743 --> 20:03.787
- Mm...

20:03.828 --> 20:07.791
- The deal was no more murders,
so there's no more next.

20:07.832 --> 20:08.875
- Sure, yeah.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.794
Between us,
there's no more, right?

20:10.835 --> 20:13.505
But the audience,
they don't need to know that.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.382
You know, I mean,
it can't be

20:15.423 --> 20:18.051
"Interview with a Retired
Serial Killer."

20:18.093 --> 20:19.636
Guys, come on, that's not hot.

20:19.678 --> 20:20.970
You know?
- It's not hot.

20:21.012 --> 20:24.891
- Our selling point here
is that I am still active.

20:24.933 --> 20:28.436
I'm out there, watching.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.314
Who's next?

20:31.356 --> 20:33.566
[dramatic music]

20:33.608 --> 20:34.901
You feel that? See?

20:34.943 --> 20:37.779
It sells jeopardy,
danger, stakes.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.656
That's what's gonna get
our fans excited.

20:39.698 --> 20:42.617
- We're not comfortable
being a part of a project

20:42.659 --> 20:46.162
that's promising
future murders.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.997
- Guess you should have thought
about that

20:48.039 --> 20:51.001
before you got into business
with a fucking serial killer.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.676
- You did say
this was a discussion.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.219
- Oh, yeah, no, and it is.
- Okay.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.471
- Always is.
It always is.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.432
Until it isn't.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.017
In the end,
there does need to be

21:07.058 --> 21:10.145
one voice that's in charge
of the creative.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.354
- Sure.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.314
- We got
the Stanley fucking Kubrick...

21:13.356 --> 21:14.983
- Okay.
- Of serial killers here.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.819
- So Uncle Stan stays in,
"Who's next?" stays in,

21:17.861 --> 21:20.447
and we go with my title, right?

21:20.488 --> 21:22.699
All good?

21:22.741 --> 21:25.201
- I think that's--
okay, I think that's fine.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.786
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

21:26.828 --> 21:28.455
- Yeah, all good.
- Great.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.914
You are not gonna regret this.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.916
I'm gonna upload it
onto the server.

21:31.958 --> 21:32.876
- Server?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.377
No, I got the VPN ready.
- Yeah.

21:34.419 --> 21:35.628
- No, no, no.
VPN's not secure enough.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.005
I got an off-shore
Russian server.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.548
It's totally untraceable.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.550
- Oh, my God, what?
- Don't ask.

21:40.592 --> 21:42.677
- Okay.
- Guys...

21:42.719 --> 21:44.429
I think we should toast.
- Mm.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.264
- Yeah? Come on.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.600
- Sure, let's do it.
- Yeah?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.852
"Based on a True Story."

21:50.894 --> 21:54.105
both: "Based on a True Story."

- Welcome
to "Based On A True Story:

season one.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.311
[tense music]

22:33.353 --> 22:36.523
What you're about to hear
has never been done before.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.066
An interview with...
- Nathan.

22:38.108 --> 22:39.526
- An active serial killer.
- Nathan.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.820
- Hey.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.155
Michelle, how are you?
- Good, good.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.282
Quick question.
- Sure, hit me.

22:46.324 --> 22:49.452
- That friend of yours
at the Fun Zone the other day,

22:49.494 --> 22:51.162
the hot dad?

22:51.204 --> 22:52.956
- The hot dad?

22:52.997 --> 22:54.708
Are you talking about Matt?

22:54.749 --> 22:57.752
- Yeah.
- What is he like?

22:57.794 --> 23:00.171
- Um, I have no idea.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.673
I mean, I don't really know
him that well.

23:01.715 --> 23:02.799
I just met him.
- Oh.

23:02.841 --> 23:04.175
Just wanted
to check in with you

23:04.217 --> 23:05.260
if he was good people.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.636
'Cause we have
a playdate coming up.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.430
- A playdate?
- Yeah!

23:08.471 --> 23:09.848
Yeah.
Our kids are hangin' out.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.266
- I don't know if that's a--

23:11.307 --> 23:14.436
- I mean, it's not
a weird, sexy date, per se,

23:14.477 --> 23:15.937
unless he wants to make it one,

23:15.979 --> 23:17.397
which would be
kind of awesome...

23:17.439 --> 23:18.732
- Yeah, no, I--
- But, um--

23:18.773 --> 23:20.025
- I just want
to be honest with you,

23:20.066 --> 23:21.192
I can't really vouch for him.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.861
I mean, LA guys, right?
- Yeah.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.863
- You gotta be careful
out there.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.365
- As long as there's
no red flags or anything.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.575
- I--

23:28.616 --> 23:30.118
- What's the worst
that could happen?

23:30.160 --> 23:31.411
- Listen, I can't
totally vouch for him.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.705
- That's--oh, one more thing.
- I just met him.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.373
- The cops were here
for you again.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.752
- What? When?
- Yesterday, the same ones.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.045
What is going on?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.504
Do you have a secret life
or something?

23:41.546 --> 23:43.131
- Me? No.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.924
I wish.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.470
- Okay, well,
can you, um, call them?

23:48.511 --> 23:51.139
'Cause the LAPD
hanging around the Pilates room

23:51.181 --> 23:52.307
isn't a great look.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.558
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.518
- I'm on it.
- Okay, bye.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.228
Wish me luck.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.563
- Bye.

23:58.605 --> 24:05.737
* *

24:08.865 --> 24:10.075
- Nice. All right.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.368
Good, good.
- Let's go again, Dad.

24:11.409 --> 24:12.952
- Ready?

24:14.662 --> 24:17.123
Nice, okay.
Nice, nice, nice, good job.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.209
All right, cool, I'm gonna
show you how to hit this.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.960
Cheat a little bit this way.
Yep.

24:21.002 --> 24:24.673
You start here, and then you go
high, low, high, all right?

24:24.714 --> 24:26.383
Come on.

24:26.424 --> 24:28.551
Ready?
- Yep.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.637
Thanks, Dad.
- You got it, buddy.

24:30.679 --> 24:32.639
All right.
Let's do this.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.517
- Babe, hey! Hi.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.227
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

24:37.268 --> 24:38.812
- What are you doing here?
- No, I'm good.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.272
The new numbers are dropping
in five minutes, the downloads!

24:41.314 --> 24:42.649
So I wanted
to be here with you.

24:42.691 --> 24:43.942
- Holy shit, already?
That was fast.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.443
- I know.
- What do we need?

24:45.485 --> 24:48.238
- Well, "Sisters In Crime,"
first 48 hours,

24:48.279 --> 24:50.657
did half a million
downloads, so...

24:50.699 --> 24:52.033
- Half a million?
- I know.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.493
- That's a fuckin' lot.

24:53.535 --> 24:54.661
- Yeah, but we're
gonna be a hit.

24:54.703 --> 24:55.954
We're gonna blow them
out of the water.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.081
So exciting.
- Listen, uh...

24:58.123 --> 24:59.708
- What?

25:01.501 --> 25:04.295
- I don't wanna do the alibi.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.089
- Why? What do you mean?

25:06.131 --> 25:07.549
- The cops came back again.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.009
- [sighs]
Shit, really?

25:09.050 --> 25:10.301
- Yeah.
They're not gonna stop.

25:10.343 --> 25:11.761
I don't wanna do it.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.013
Look at this kid.

25:13.054 --> 25:16.683
Look at the way
he looks at his dad.

25:16.725 --> 25:19.602
I want my kid
to look at me that way.

25:19.644 --> 25:22.355
- Ew, that's Lewis Heeney.
He's a total fucking creeper.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.649
He tried to fuck me
at the luau party.

25:24.691 --> 25:25.859
- What?
- Yeah.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.193
He hits on
all the pregnant women.

25:27.235 --> 25:28.987
Everyone knows that.
He's a real fuckin' weirdo.

25:29.029 --> 25:30.613
So you might want
to find another example.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.282
- Okay, fine.
He's not great.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.825
But I don't want
my kid to remember me

25:33.867 --> 25:35.869
as a guy who helped
a fuckin' serial killer.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.954
- We're not helping him.
We're stopping him.

25:37.996 --> 25:40.498
Your kid
is gonna remember a hero.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.500
And that's--
- Oh, fuck.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.002
* *

25:44.044 --> 25:46.421
- What?
- The cops are back.

25:46.463 --> 25:47.922
Fuck. Shit.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.341
- Okay, let's, uh--
- They're fuckin' here.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.009
- Let's just go
take a walk, okay?

25:51.051 --> 25:53.887
Yeah, let's just
kind of walk quickly.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.221
It's--okay.
- We gotta think, okay?

25:55.263 --> 25:56.681
We just need a minute to think.

25:56.723 --> 25:57.932
- Let's go--
- I'm--

25:57.974 --> 26:00.727
- Let's go this way.
- Where are we going?

26:00.769 --> 26:02.062
- Let's go for the stairs.
- Stair, really?

26:02.103 --> 26:03.188
- Go with the stairs.
- Oh, great.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.564
- Come on, come on.
- That's great.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.066
- Okay, okay?
You good?

26:06.107 --> 26:08.360
Can you go any faster?
- Pregnant women love stairs.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.195
Go, go, go, go, go.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.238
- Oh, my God.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.907
[sighs]

26:13.948 --> 26:16.993
* *

26:17.035 --> 26:18.203
- Fuck, they're coming.
- Okay, you're acting crazy.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.621
- Okay, we gotta
think this through.

26:19.662 --> 26:20.914
- You gotta calm down.
- Should I run? I'm gonna run.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.207
- Give me a kiss.
I'm gonna run.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.291
- You're not gonna run.
They know where we live.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.793
There's no running.
- Okay.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.336
What am I gonna say to them?
What the fuck am I gonna do?

26:26.378 --> 26:28.838
- Listen, we are
literally a minute away

26:28.880 --> 26:30.340
from all of our dreams
coming true.

26:30.382 --> 26:31.925
Do you understand that?
- What if it tanks?

26:31.966 --> 26:33.134
What if I'm selling
my soul for nothing?

26:33.176 --> 26:34.427
- Okay, what is the alibi?

26:34.469 --> 26:35.887
What is the movie that he said?
The alibi.

26:35.929 --> 26:37.555
- I think it was the, uh--
was it "The Rock"?

26:37.597 --> 26:39.557
- I think it was "Con Air."
- No, it wasn't "Con Air."

26:39.599 --> 26:42.394
"Snake Eyes."
- This isn't a guessing game.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.020
- What the fuck was it?
- Just--I don't--

26:44.062 --> 26:45.188
listen, we have ten--

26:45.230 --> 26:46.564
wait, we have
literally ten seconds.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.191
If you do not alibi this guy,

26:48.233 --> 26:50.110
our entire house of cards
falls down, okay?

26:50.151 --> 26:51.736
Do you understand that?
- You gotta go.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.113
- Okay, okay.
Okay, listen to me.

26:53.154 --> 26:54.823
Listen to me.
Alibi, alibi, alibi.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.282
If you want to.
It's your choice.

26:56.324 --> 26:57.659
If you don't alibi,
I swear to--

26:57.701 --> 27:00.286
- No, no, no, babe.
Babe, I don't know what to do.

27:00.328 --> 27:07.293
* *

27:08.420 --> 27:10.422
- There he is.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.756
- Hey.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.216
- Just the man
we're lookin' for.

27:13.258 --> 27:15.760
- Hey, I'm still waiting
for my spin class.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.387
- Let me--let me work
on that...

27:17.429 --> 27:18.805
- All right.
- And I'll get back to you.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.390
- Sweet, sweet.
- What's up?

27:23.309 --> 27:25.395
- The night
of the Chloe Lake murder,

27:25.437 --> 27:27.772
when you left the bar,
where'd you go?

27:27.814 --> 27:29.482
- Where'd I go?

27:29.524 --> 27:32.902
* *

27:32.944 --> 27:34.779
I went home.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.073
- Were you alone?
Anyone with you?
