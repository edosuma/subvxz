00:50.959 --> 00:52.250
- Mom.
- Olive.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.667
I really don't think
the kids are gonna like

00:54.667 --> 00:56.834
gruyere biscuits.

00:56.834 --> 00:58.667
You're goin' on a field
trip to the mountains

00:58.667 --> 01:01.792
and I promised Mr. Bowman
that I would provide

01:01.792 --> 01:03.000
an appropriate snack.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.834
I'm pretty sure
he meant trail mix.

01:05.792 --> 01:07.667
Gruyere is an Alpine cheese.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.333
And we're going
to the Rockies.

01:09.333 --> 01:11.542
And Mr. Bowman's
not even coming.

01:11.542 --> 01:13.834
He says he's needed at that.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.000
Right. So am I.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.417
Okay, so I think
they're gonna love 'em.

01:19.417 --> 01:21.458
Yes, and you're gonna
have the best time.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.250
I love you.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.291
You're gonna have a great time.

01:25.291 --> 01:27.125
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.041
That is the chocolate-covered
shortbread I have read about.

02:06.041 --> 02:08.667
Hi, Laura!

02:08.667 --> 02:10.208
Hi, honey.

02:10.208 --> 02:12.250
Or do I need to call you
Dr. Smiley on school grounds.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.083
Eh, call me excited
for your feast.

02:15.083 --> 02:16.542
Oh, you're gonna be here!

02:16.542 --> 02:18.583
Barring a student in need
of emergency counseling,

02:18.583 --> 02:19.875
I will be here.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.083
Aw.

02:21.083 --> 02:23.333
Well, that makes me
very happy because

02:23.333 --> 02:25.875
I would not have this
job if it weren't for you

02:25.875 --> 02:27.250
pitching me to Adele.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.667
Oh, I'd love to
take the credit,

02:28.667 --> 02:30.834
but when I went to Adele
to sing your praises,

02:30.834 --> 02:33.083
they'd already been
sung quite well

02:33.083 --> 02:35.333
by another faculty member.

02:35.333 --> 02:36.667
Any guesses as to who?

02:36.667 --> 02:38.000
Brad Bowman?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.542
Gold star for Goldy.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.333
Has he asked you out yet?

02:42.333 --> 02:43.583
No.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.166
He's Olive's teacher.

02:45.166 --> 02:49.291
There is no policy against
faculty-parent relationships.

02:49.291 --> 02:52.250
Did you come in here
to make me go on a date?

02:52.250 --> 02:53.792
No.

02:53.792 --> 02:55.291
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about something

02:55.291 --> 02:56.542
that I've noticed.

02:56.542 --> 02:57.625
There's been-
- Goldy.

02:57.625 --> 03:00.208
Oh, hi, Laura.

03:00.208 --> 03:01.458
Hi, Brad.

03:01.458 --> 03:02.959
It's funny, we were
just talking about-

03:02.959 --> 03:04.792
When people were gonna arrive.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.792
Uh, well, that would be now.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.333
They're gathering out front.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.875
Sending the menu in advance
was clearly a brilliant move.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.208
Yes, it was.

03:12.208 --> 03:13.959
So, are we good
to open the doors?

03:13.959 --> 03:14.959
Absolutely.

03:14.959 --> 03:16.208
I'll handle it.

03:16.208 --> 03:17.917
Oh, I thought
you wanted to talk.

03:17.917 --> 03:18.750
Later.

03:22.583 --> 03:23.750
I was wondering-

03:23.750 --> 03:25.625
When I was gonna
finish these cookies?

03:25.625 --> 03:27.375
Well, the answer is now.

03:28.959 --> 03:29.834
Yeah.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.959
Hi, hi, um.

03:43.959 --> 03:45.000
Hi.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.375
I'm sorry about that.

03:46.375 --> 03:47.834
Oh, no worries.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.834
I'm just gonna say it, okay?

03:51.834 --> 03:53.500
Okay.

03:53.500 --> 03:57.458
I haven't been on a
date since my divorce,

03:57.458 --> 03:59.250
which technically means
I haven't been on a date

03:59.250 --> 04:01.000
since before I was married.
- Right.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.083
And it's easy to say that
I just haven't had time

04:03.083 --> 04:05.667
between Olive and being
a chef at The Bistro

04:05.667 --> 04:06.750
and starting my own business,

04:06.750 --> 04:09.458
but the truth is, um,

04:11.041 --> 04:11.875
I am terrified

04:13.792 --> 04:14.959
to even think about it.

04:16.709 --> 04:17.542
I understand.

04:18.709 --> 04:20.542
You are very understanding.

04:20.542 --> 04:23.500
I'm a teacher.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.375
So.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.000
Friday night, The Bistro.

04:29.458 --> 04:32.291
I go on my first date

04:32.291 --> 04:35.458
in 12 years.

04:35.458 --> 04:36.500
Ah.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.750
- With you.
- Okay.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.166
If you're free.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.000
I am.

04:42.792 --> 04:43.792
I'll meet you at 7:00.

04:43.792 --> 04:45.208
Sounds good.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.291
There she is.

04:48.291 --> 04:49.792
And there he is.

04:49.792 --> 04:51.291
Hey, Adele, Archie.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.375
Excuse me.
- Okay.

04:53.917 --> 04:55.834
Goldy, confession.

04:55.834 --> 04:58.166
Brad did have to twist
my arm to convince me

04:58.166 --> 05:01.500
to use the booster club as the
beta test for your business.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.875
But look who's smiling now.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.333
Oh, I certainly am.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.750
It's like I'm sitting at Cafe
du Mont in the French Quarter.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.750
Yes, I had to stop
Archie from going back

05:09.750 --> 05:11.583
for second beignets.

05:11.583 --> 05:14.000
Anyways, everything looks
absolutely gorgeous.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.750
It's like you've been
doing this for eons.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.041
Thank you.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.917
And thank you so much
for this opportunity.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.792
I really appreciate it.

05:21.792 --> 05:22.959
And you know what?

05:22.959 --> 05:24.417
We have reserved
beignets in the kitchen.

05:24.417 --> 05:28.417
Oh, be still my heart.

05:28.417 --> 05:29.250
All right, you.

05:38.125 --> 05:38.959
Marla!

05:41.041 --> 05:42.834
That is exactly what
these shortbreads said

05:42.834 --> 05:44.500
when I walked in.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.583
They went, "Marla!"

05:46.583 --> 05:49.917
They called my name and now
we're in love.

05:49.917 --> 05:53.458
Well, as long as the beignets
weren't talking to you.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.875
Archie Dennison is already
in a committed relationship

05:55.875 --> 05:56.792
with them.

05:56.792 --> 05:58.417
Oh, I wonder if Adele knows.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.625
Maybe she'll catch him in
the act with the beignets.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.083
Stop it!

06:02.083 --> 06:03.792
She didn't catch anyone.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.750
Oh, it's not the
story Adele tells.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.792
I have told you, there
is nothing going on

06:07.792 --> 06:09.166
between Archie and Laura.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.792
Yeah, you did tell me that,

06:10.792 --> 06:12.625
just like you told me you and
Richard weren't splitting up.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.208
Oh! Hey now!

06:14.208 --> 06:15.667
Going for the jugular.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.667
No, not at all.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.917
I'm going for the truth.

06:18.792 --> 06:19.750
He's here, by the way.

06:19.750 --> 06:20.500
Who?

06:20.500 --> 06:21.417
Your ex.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.583
Yeah, he's cornered Brad Bowman.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.125
Might wanna go save Brad.

06:26.125 --> 06:27.583
Ugh.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.417
There's not enough
shortbread in this room.

06:29.417 --> 06:32.500
Not only is it a
great investment,

06:32.500 --> 06:34.667
but it's also great
for the community.

06:34.667 --> 06:35.834
I know that means a lot to you,

06:35.834 --> 06:37.667
being a a fourth
generation Elk Parker.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.250
Wow, how did you know that?

06:39.250 --> 06:43.291
Trust me, I do lots of
research on potential investors.

06:43.291 --> 06:44.917
Well, I'm not sure I'm that-

06:44.917 --> 06:46.834
Brad, I am.

06:46.834 --> 06:47.667
You are what?

06:48.834 --> 06:50.500
Ah, Goldy, hello.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.875
Nicely done, by the way.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.583
I should never have doubted you.

06:54.583 --> 06:55.750
Well, if you
hadn't doubted me,

06:55.750 --> 06:57.166
then I might not
have been so impelled

06:57.166 --> 07:00.041
to prove you wrong.

07:00.041 --> 07:01.250
You were what?

07:01.250 --> 07:03.458
Confident that Mr.
Bowman here will invest

07:03.458 --> 07:05.625
in a tremendous new
opportunity that will be

07:05.625 --> 07:06.709
a boon for the town.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.291
The Elk Park Wellness Center.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.000
What?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.166
Yeah.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.834
I mean, you're not the
only one that could

07:16.834 --> 07:18.208
start a new business.

07:19.709 --> 07:21.125
Forgive me, Dr. Korman.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.291
I see a parent in distress.

07:22.291 --> 07:23.417
Brad, yeah, thank you.

07:23.417 --> 07:24.875
I'll be in touch.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.834
Oh, come on.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.709
You don't have to worry
about your child support.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.458
I'm not, I'm not.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.917
But how much are you
putting into this thing?

07:39.917 --> 07:42.083
I'm a minority investor.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.625
Come on, you and
Olive will be fine.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.083
I'm not worried about that.

07:46.583 --> 07:49.750
Look, my new business
is just me doing

07:49.750 --> 07:52.208
what I've always done, cooking.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.041
Since when are you a
property developer?

07:55.041 --> 07:58.208
I'm a doctor, and the
property happens to be

07:58.208 --> 07:59.875
the wellness center.

07:59.875 --> 08:02.041
Well, if you're hitting
up school teachers

08:02.041 --> 08:03.834
for an investment, I
can tell you right now-

08:03.834 --> 08:06.375
I'm hitting up school
teachers who happen to be

08:06.375 --> 08:08.000
worth over $5 million dollars,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
thank you to their
family's silver mine.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.500
And I'm not the only investor.

08:14.542 --> 08:15.834
Who?

08:15.834 --> 08:16.667
Well, um.

08:18.250 --> 08:19.709
Archie, for one.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.291
That doesn't make
me feel better.

08:22.291 --> 08:25.291
And the other one is
about to make his way over.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.125
Owen Gentle?

08:26.125 --> 08:27.125
Dr. Gentle.

08:27.125 --> 08:29.208
I know he's a doctor.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.291
- Goldy.
- Hi.

08:30.291 --> 08:32.208
The meal is sublime.

08:32.208 --> 08:33.667
Oh.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.709
I confess to inhaling my
poached salmon.

08:35.709 --> 08:38.125
Mmm, well, I must
confess that my supplier

08:38.125 --> 08:41.125
was short and it's
actually steelhead trout.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.291
Hmm, and yet the
advanced menu said salmon,

08:43.291 --> 08:46.417
so my tongue tasted salmon.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.709
Power of suggestion
at work, eh, Richard?

08:48.709 --> 08:50.125
Absolutely.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.625
Power of suggestion?

08:51.625 --> 08:54.000
Oh, I, uh, use it all
the time in my hypnotherapy

08:54.000 --> 08:56.375
to treat serious addictions.

08:56.375 --> 08:57.625
Hmm.

08:57.625 --> 08:59.208
Oh, and speaking of
treating addictions,

08:59.208 --> 09:02.166
I was just telling
Goldy about our venture

09:02.166 --> 09:04.166
and she was-
- Confused.

09:05.667 --> 09:08.500
But so happy that
you're a part of it.

09:08.500 --> 09:12.583
I'm happy, too.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.291
Well, I have to
get back to work.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.375
Great job.

09:15.375 --> 09:16.667
Thank you. Enjoy.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.625
Right?

09:21.625 --> 09:22.875
Oh!

09:22.875 --> 09:24.083
There we go. Sorry.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.750
It's okay.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.834
Okay, that's all right.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.291
No, it's all good.

09:29.291 --> 09:30.750
Okay, no, it's fine.

09:30.750 --> 09:31.709
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.667
I didn't bring the champagne!

09:33.667 --> 09:36.000
Hey, I got it, I
got it, I got it.

09:39.834 --> 09:41.750
It's not a party until
someone breaks a glass.

09:45.709 --> 09:47.792
I'm sorry, but um, I
think we need to leave,

09:47.792 --> 09:49.375
and would it be okay
if I brought you

09:49.375 --> 09:50.208
your check tomorrow?

09:50.208 --> 09:51.208
Oh, of course, yeah.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.583
- You okay?
- Yeah, okay.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.375
Well, that was well handled.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.291
Well, cleaning up that
glass is a lot easier

10:02.291 --> 10:06.291
than fixing what's broken
in that relationship.

10:06.291 --> 10:08.208
Can we still talk?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.709
Yeah, go for it.

10:09.709 --> 10:10.709
Somewhere else.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.250
Okay, do you want
me to come meet you

10:13.250 --> 10:14.166
at your office when I'm done?

10:14.166 --> 10:15.959
I'm heading out.

10:15.959 --> 10:17.208
Counseling clinic?

10:17.208 --> 10:19.000
Would my house be okay?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.125
Yeah.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.166
You meet me there?

10:21.166 --> 10:22.333
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:22.333 --> 10:23.709
I'll see you there.
- Okay.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Excuse me.

10:44.000 --> 10:44.750
Can I help you?

10:46.208 --> 10:47.041
Julian.

10:47.041 --> 10:48.375
Hey, Mr. Bowman.

10:48.375 --> 10:49.667
Hey.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.250
Uh, your mom and Archie,
they left awhile ago.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.875
Yeah, no, I'm actually
not here for them.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.083
Okay.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.750
Well, can I help
you with something?

10:57.875 --> 10:59.709
No, I'm just
waitin' on someone.

11:00.667 --> 11:01.500
Okay.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.125
Well, uh, it's good
to see you, Julian.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.667
Yeah, you too, Mr. Bowman.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.542
We've
got your usual Elk Park

11:45.542 --> 11:47.041
drive time traffic report.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.000
Now we are getting some
reports of an accident

11:51.000 --> 11:53.917
on Copper Canyon Road that
could really slow things

11:53.917 --> 11:57.875
down tonight, so please
drive accordingly.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.917
Call Laura Smiley.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.667
Hi, it's Laura.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.000
You know what to do.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.583
Hey, it's me.

12:14.583 --> 12:15.458
Um.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
There's been an accident.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.917
I'm so sorry.

12:18.917 --> 12:21.583
I just, I don't know how
long this is gonna take,

12:21.583 --> 12:23.792
but I guess I'll see
ya when I see ya.

12:28.834 --> 12:29.834
Hey, Mason!

12:30.959 --> 12:31.792
What's goin' on?

12:31.792 --> 12:32.667
Hey, Goldy.

12:32.667 --> 12:33.542
Hey.

12:34.709 --> 12:36.125
Car ran off the cliff.

12:36.125 --> 12:36.959
What?

12:38.208 --> 12:39.959
Is it someone from Elk Park?

12:39.959 --> 12:41.291
Listen, before we
announce a death,

12:41.291 --> 12:43.375
we need to confirm
ID, notify the family.

12:43.375 --> 12:46.500
Vehicle
registered to one Laura Smiley.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.792
What?

12:47.792 --> 12:50.083
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.375
Goldy, you can't go in there!

12:51.375 --> 12:53.792
Goldy, you can't go down there!

12:53.792 --> 12:55.291
Ma'am, ma'am,
get back, get back.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.041
There's already one
body down there.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.166
What?

12:59.166 --> 13:00.041
Mason.

13:00.041 --> 13:00.792
She's dead?

13:02.291 --> 13:03.458
Laura's dead?

13:03.458 --> 13:04.959
Laura's her friend.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.583
She heard the dispatcher
give the ID on my walkie.

13:06.583 --> 13:07.709
No, no, no, no.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.125
I was, I was just with her.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.792
Miss Barry, she's gone.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.291
Okay, there's
nothing you can do.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.542
No.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.333
Mason's gonna
take care of you.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.375
I'll be by in a minute.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.667
Detective Shultz is
gonna talk to you now.

13:35.667 --> 13:39.917
He's, um, he can come on
kinda strong sometimes,

13:39.917 --> 13:44.166
but he's a great guy and,
you know, a real detective.

13:44.166 --> 13:45.834
I just mean he's
super experienced.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.291
He just transferred
from San Francisco

13:47.291 --> 13:49.542
and he's worked on major
cases and he's got this wavy-

13:49.542 --> 13:50.417
Mason.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.250
He's right behind
me, isn't he?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.083
Yup.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.417
Detective, I was just
explaining that you've

14:00.417 --> 14:01.208
worked on a lot of-

14:01.208 --> 14:02.041
Major cases?

14:02.917 --> 14:03.709
Yeah.

14:04.625 --> 14:08.375
Thanks, Mason.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.208
Mason.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.041
Notepad.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.125
I have my notepad.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.458
You have to take
notes too, okay?

14:18.458 --> 14:20.792
It's good to have more
than one perspective.

14:20.792 --> 14:21.792
Yes, sir.

14:23.291 --> 14:27.125
Miss Barry, I'm
Detective Tom Shultz.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.458
I'm sorry for your loss,

14:31.458 --> 14:32.959
and I know this is the
last thing you wanna be

14:32.959 --> 14:34.583
doing right now, but I have
to ask you some questions

14:34.583 --> 14:36.583
about your friend, okay?

14:36.583 --> 14:37.417
Okay.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.583
So how long have
you known Miss Smiley?

14:42.583 --> 14:44.792
Dr. Smiley, actually.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.166
She's a, um.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.083
Was.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.166
She was a psychiatrist.

14:59.583 --> 15:03.291
And how long have
you known Dr. Smiley?

15:03.291 --> 15:04.166
Uh.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.083
When she first moved to
town about four years ago.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.083
She was a counselor at my
daughter Olive's school,

15:13.083 --> 15:14.083
Elk Park Prep.

15:15.917 --> 15:18.291
But she's only been doing
that for like a year.

15:18.291 --> 15:22.041
She has a private
practice and, um,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.750
Olive was a client of
hers when my marriage

15:26.750 --> 15:27.709
was coming apart.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.125
She married?

15:31.125 --> 15:31.959
No.

15:31.959 --> 15:32.792
Children?

15:37.959 --> 15:39.375
You said you saw
her this afternoon.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.000
Where was that?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.208
Uh, the luncheon,
the booster club.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.041
I was catering.

15:46.041 --> 15:49.375
Was there alcohol
at the lunch?

15:49.375 --> 15:50.625
Mimosas.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.291
I'm sure that Laura
didn't have any.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.709
You know, it was just
mostly for parents,

15:53.709 --> 15:55.208
you know, the big donors.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.125
She have a heart condition?

15:59.166 --> 16:00.250
No.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.250
Her health, as
far as you know?

16:02.500 --> 16:05.417
She was a skier,
a runner, a hiker.

16:05.417 --> 16:06.834
- Was she depressed?
- No.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.500
That was a quick no.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.667
Why are you
asking me all this?

16:19.834 --> 16:21.000
There's no skid marks.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.208
No signs that Dr.
Smiley tried to stop.

16:24.208 --> 16:25.792
We'll know more when
we've done the autopsy,

16:25.792 --> 16:30.667
but for now we're treating
this as a suspicious death.

16:46.375 --> 16:49.208
Hi.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.291
Did you figure out the, um-

16:51.291 --> 16:52.417
Cause of death?

16:52.417 --> 16:53.250
Yeah.

16:55.375 --> 16:56.709
Can I come in?

16:57.875 --> 16:59.375
Sure, yes. Please.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.917
So, uh, when is
the autopsy done?

17:06.917 --> 17:10.417
Well, in a different
sized city, not long,

17:10.417 --> 17:12.625
but Ferma County has
a medical examiner

17:12.625 --> 17:15.208
that happens to be at
a conference in Florida

17:15.208 --> 17:16.834
and she's not back for
a couple more days.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.542
So then what happens?

17:18.542 --> 17:20.458
Forensics is
processing her car,

17:21.709 --> 17:22.667
and they've confirmed
that there was nothing

17:22.667 --> 17:24.333
done to disable it.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.917
What, it?

17:25.917 --> 17:29.166
Are you saying that you think
that someone might've, what?

17:29.166 --> 17:30.500
No, I'm saying
what I already said.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.834
Her death is suspicious,

17:31.834 --> 17:34.500
and it's my job to look
at every possibility.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.500
You mind if I ask you
a few more questions?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.458
Okay if I keep cooking?

17:45.458 --> 17:46.291
Sure.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.250
So, um, Laura's license, it
had a Denver address on it.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.583
She kept her condo.

17:54.583 --> 17:55.792
Uses it as an Airbnb.

17:55.792 --> 17:56.834
So she's not married.

17:56.834 --> 17:57.750
She seeing anyone?

18:00.125 --> 18:01.000
No.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.250
Why the hesitation?

18:05.166 --> 18:08.792
There's, there's just
this ugly rumor going around

18:08.792 --> 18:11.291
that she's having an
affair with a married man,

18:11.291 --> 18:15.208
but it's not true, and
Laura swore it wasn't.

18:15.208 --> 18:16.583
Okay, well, who was it?

18:16.583 --> 18:17.709
Archie Dennison.

18:18.750 --> 18:19.792
His wife's Adele.

18:21.875 --> 18:24.458
Does Adele know
about this gossip?

18:24.458 --> 18:26.959
As far as I know, she
probably started it.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.375
Would you like me to give
you a tour of my house?

18:31.291 --> 18:32.125
No, I'm fine.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.125
How long have Dr. Smiley
and Mr. Dennison been-

18:36.125 --> 18:37.041
Look, hey!

18:37.041 --> 18:39.625
They haven't been anything.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.959
I just told you that.

18:42.959 --> 18:45.458
How long have Dr.
Smiley and Mr. Dennison

18:45.458 --> 18:48.000
been allegedly involved?

18:50.667 --> 18:53.583
I heard the rumor
a few days ago.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.083
And were Archie and Adele
at the booster club luncheon?

18:56.083 --> 18:59.458
Yes, they both
were because Adele is

18:59.458 --> 19:01.041
the president of the boosters.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.083
Anything happen there
between the Dennisons

19:03.083 --> 19:03.917
and Dr. Smiley?

19:05.333 --> 19:06.750
What?

19:06.750 --> 19:09.583
Archie had a few
too many mimosas,

19:09.583 --> 19:11.750
and he's a flirt,
but not with Laura,

19:11.750 --> 19:16.667
and Adele and Archie left
hours before it was even over.

19:17.917 --> 19:20.000
What do they do,
Archie and Adele?

19:21.417 --> 19:24.709
Well, Adele is rich and
Archie is married to Adele,

19:24.709 --> 19:28.417
but apparently he
is now partnered up

19:28.417 --> 19:32.125
with my ex-husband to help
build a wellness center.

19:34.625 --> 19:36.000
You have something
against wellness centers?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.542
Not at all, no.

19:37.542 --> 19:39.959
I just would never expect
for either one of them

19:39.959 --> 19:41.417
to be involved with one.

19:41.417 --> 19:42.250
Gotcha.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.250
Well, thanks for the coffee.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.041
Look, I'm sorry.

19:48.041 --> 19:49.917
I'm just usually not, um-

19:49.917 --> 19:51.542
Dealing with the
death of a dear friend

19:51.542 --> 19:54.458
while talking to a
detective in your kitchen?

19:54.458 --> 19:55.375
Pretty much.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.709
I'll let you get
back to your cooking.

20:06.208 --> 20:07.083
Uh, listen.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.375
This probably doesn't
mean anything,

20:11.375 --> 20:14.834
but at the luncheon

20:14.834 --> 20:16.500
Laura asked to talk to me

20:16.500 --> 20:18.291
and she wanted to
talk in private.

20:19.959 --> 20:22.500
That's why I was on the
Canyon Road tonight.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.000
I was going to see her.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.834
And you have no idea
what it was about?

20:32.667 --> 20:34.083
I'll see myself out.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.667
Mr. Bowman?

20:50.667 --> 20:52.959
Do you know about...

20:52.959 --> 20:53.792
Dr. Smiley?

20:54.834 --> 20:56.458
I do.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.041
And we're gonna make a lot
of space today in class

20:58.041 --> 20:59.166
to talk about it.

21:00.125 --> 21:00.834
Go on in, kiddo.

21:07.208 --> 21:08.041
How are you?

21:10.834 --> 21:12.291
A mess.

21:12.291 --> 21:13.125
I bet.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.333
Listen, ah, we can
take a rain check

21:17.333 --> 21:19.333
this Friday at The Bistro.

21:19.333 --> 21:22.834
No, I, uh, I actually
think it'll be good.

21:24.792 --> 21:27.542
And I'm looking forward
to it.

21:27.542 --> 21:28.375
Me, too.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.291
Take care of her.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.166
I will.

22:50.125 --> 22:51.208
Excuse me, Goldy?

22:52.583 --> 22:53.458
Hi.

22:54.959 --> 22:55.792
Oh.

22:58.125 --> 22:59.750
You must've heard.

22:59.750 --> 23:00.500
It's, um.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.083
It's devastating.

23:03.917 --> 23:06.250
So, so tragic.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.750
The police called this morning.

23:09.750 --> 23:10.667
I just, I...

23:12.875 --> 23:14.250
I can't believe it.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.083
I know.

23:15.083 --> 23:15.917
Oh, I know.

23:16.959 --> 23:18.500
Oh, I'm so sorry.

23:22.125 --> 23:25.166
Goldy, please let
me know if I can help

23:25.166 --> 23:27.333
in any way with the funeral.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.792
That's so nice, thank you.

23:29.834 --> 23:30.667
Dr. Gentle?

23:36.917 --> 23:38.458
Dr. Gentle?

23:38.458 --> 23:39.291
Yes.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.583
Detective Tom Shultz.

23:42.583 --> 23:44.041
We spoke earlier.

23:44.041 --> 23:45.041
Owen Gentle.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.875
My condolences.

23:47.875 --> 23:48.709
Thank you.

23:50.834 --> 23:52.291
Miss Barry, what are you?

23:52.291 --> 23:53.166
What are you doing here?

23:55.291 --> 23:58.917
I just came by to
make sure that Owen

23:58.917 --> 24:00.125
had heard the news.

24:02.667 --> 24:06.208
Well, I told you not to
touch anything in her office.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.041
And I heeded your wishes.

24:08.041 --> 24:10.959
So what were you
doing in there?

24:10.959 --> 24:11.875
Uh.

24:11.875 --> 24:14.875
Actually, I was in the office.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.083
Okay.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.500
Well, I need to speak to you,

24:23.500 --> 24:25.375
but I have to talk to
you first, Dr. Gentle.

24:25.375 --> 24:26.875
And I really need
to get to work.

24:26.875 --> 24:27.792
That wasn't a request.

24:27.792 --> 24:29.417
You have somewhere we can talk?

24:29.417 --> 24:30.291
Uh, of course.

24:30.291 --> 24:31.542
My office is right over here.

24:35.333 --> 24:36.208
Have a seat.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.333
- Look, I don't-
- Come with me.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.500
What were you doing in
Dr. Smiley's office?

25:04.500 --> 25:07.458
I was, what does that mean?

25:07.458 --> 25:08.959
It's a pretty direct question.

25:08.959 --> 25:10.542
I was, I wasn't
doing anything.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.417
I was only in there for 30
seconds before Owen came in.

25:13.417 --> 25:14.917
Well, unfortunately we
don't have security cameras

25:14.917 --> 25:15.959
to prove that, do we?

25:17.417 --> 25:18.875
What are you implying?

25:21.500 --> 25:24.041
I think your
behavior is suspicious.

25:24.041 --> 25:25.250
Suspicious?

25:25.250 --> 25:26.417
Yes, it's suspicious.

25:27.291 --> 25:28.208
So answer my question.

25:28.208 --> 25:29.375
What are you doing here?

25:34.291 --> 25:37.041
I was dropping
Olive off at school

25:37.041 --> 25:40.959
when I saw Adele coming out
of Laura's counseling office.

25:40.959 --> 25:44.834
Adele didn't see me, but
why would she be in there?

25:44.834 --> 25:46.583
And I went to open the
door, but it was locked.

25:46.583 --> 25:48.792
Why didn't you
call me, Miss Barry?

25:50.250 --> 25:51.291
Well, next time I will!

25:51.291 --> 25:52.166
Good.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.417
You being here, did you find
out more about Laura's death?

26:02.625 --> 26:04.959
Did you bake
chocolate-covered cookies

26:04.959 --> 26:05.875
for the luncheon?

26:05.875 --> 26:07.291
Chocolate-coated shortbread.

26:07.291 --> 26:08.625
Well, we recovered
chocolate-covered shortbread

26:08.625 --> 26:10.625
from the front seat
of Dr. Smiley's car.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.917
Well, she probably
just took some to go.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.000
Why are you asking me this?

26:20.333 --> 26:22.667
Yeah, well, we're still
processing her office.

26:24.208 --> 26:28.041
But if you hear or see or
even think of anything else,

26:29.125 --> 26:29.959
you call me.

26:29.959 --> 26:30.792
Of course.

26:32.792 --> 26:33.625
Good.

26:34.625 --> 26:35.875
One more thing.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.166
You know Julian Geddes?

26:37.166 --> 26:38.083
Yeah, that's Adele's son.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.000
Yeah, from her first husband.

26:39.000 --> 26:39.834
- Right.
- Yeah.

26:41.208 --> 26:44.333
Did Laura mention
anything to you about him?

26:44.333 --> 26:46.792
Why would Laura talk
to me about Julian?

26:46.792 --> 26:47.625
Why would she?

26:59.291 --> 27:00.458
- Ah!
- Hey.

27:00.458 --> 27:01.709
Well, this is kismet.

27:01.709 --> 27:02.583
What is?

27:02.583 --> 27:04.875
I was just coming to find you.

27:04.875 --> 27:07.333
I, um, I actually
had a question.

27:07.333 --> 27:11.083
Did you ever teach
a Julian Geddes?

27:11.083 --> 27:13.083
- That's weird.
- Why?

27:13.083 --> 27:15.375
Well, Julian was a
junior my first year here,

27:15.375 --> 27:17.834
but what's weird is that
I saw him yesterday.

27:19.041 --> 27:20.500
Where?

27:20.500 --> 27:21.959
There.

27:21.959 --> 27:23.375
I was on my way from the
dining hall after the luncheon

27:23.375 --> 27:25.875
and I saw him pacing
around the parking lot.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.834
And you, you recognized him?

27:28.834 --> 27:30.417
Not at first.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.500
No, I just saw a man lurking
around the school parking lot

27:32.500 --> 27:34.208
with a hoodie on, so.

27:34.208 --> 27:35.166
Hmm.

27:35.166 --> 27:36.083
Yeah.

27:36.083 --> 27:37.500
Said he was waiting for someone.

27:39.667 --> 27:43.208
Can you show me where
exactly he was pacing?

27:43.208 --> 27:44.917
Yeah.

27:44.917 --> 27:46.375
I was there.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.291
He was,

27:50.375 --> 27:52.917
he was probably here.

27:54.083 --> 27:55.208
Yeah.

27:56.417 --> 27:57.291
Why?

27:57.291 --> 28:00.083
Is, is he in trouble or?

28:00.083 --> 28:01.375
Is everything okay?

28:01.375 --> 28:02.208
Uh.

28:04.458 --> 28:05.417
That's...

28:06.291 --> 28:07.458
Suspicious.

28:08.917 --> 28:09.792
Yeah.

28:26.291 --> 28:27.917
- Hello?
- Adele?

28:27.917 --> 28:29.041
It's Goldy Barry.

28:43.917 --> 28:44.917
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:46.166 --> 28:47.750
You found the place?

28:47.750 --> 28:49.250
I did, yes.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.792
You'll have to forgive me.

28:55.792 --> 28:58.583
My mind has been in a
million different directions.

28:58.583 --> 29:00.041
Ah, I know the feeling.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.250
I'm sure you do.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.583
That meal yesterday?

29:02.583 --> 29:04.000
My goodness.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.959
I mean, I can barely
manage not to burn toast.

29:05.959 --> 29:06.959
Oh.

29:06.959 --> 29:08.125
I don't believe that.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.333
Well, you don't know me.

29:17.709 --> 29:21.041
Did I see your son
at school yesterday?

29:21.041 --> 29:22.542
- Julian?
- Yeah.

29:22.542 --> 29:24.792
I can't imagine that he'd
be back at his alma mater.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.709
And he lives here
now with you, right?

29:30.709 --> 29:33.792
In the guest quarters for now.

29:33.792 --> 29:34.625
Hmm.

29:38.041 --> 29:38.875
Why do you ask?

29:40.125 --> 29:41.125
Oh, um.

29:42.709 --> 29:45.959
I'm always on the lookout
for potential cater waiters.

29:46.834 --> 29:50.333
Well, I will pass that along.

29:51.125 --> 29:52.000
Here you are.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.375
Thank you so much.

29:57.709 --> 29:58.542
Goldy.

30:02.083 --> 30:03.875
I heard about Laura Smiley,

30:03.875 --> 30:05.959
and I know the two
of you were friends,

30:05.959 --> 30:08.000
and I am so sorry.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.834
Thank you.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.917
I mean, I can't
understand why the police

30:11.917 --> 30:14.166
are calling her
death suspicious.

30:14.166 --> 30:16.250
Haven't they heard the
cliche doctors are the last

30:16.250 --> 30:17.250
people to seek help?

30:19.917 --> 30:24.917
Well, I don't know that we
should be making assumptions.

30:24.917 --> 30:26.166
What else could it be?

30:27.583 --> 30:30.250
I think that she was more
fragile that she let on.

30:30.250 --> 30:33.000
Working those two
terribly draining jobs?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.709
Is it any surprise
she literally ends up

30:35.709 --> 30:37.125
driving herself to death?

30:40.208 --> 30:41.291
Well, I, um,

30:42.792 --> 30:47.125
I realize that you probably
weren't the president

30:47.125 --> 30:48.250
of her fan club.

30:52.291 --> 30:53.583
You heard the rumors.

30:53.583 --> 30:54.458
I did.

30:56.250 --> 30:58.875
And Laura assured me that
there is no truth to them.

31:00.875 --> 31:01.709
Goldy.

31:03.959 --> 31:04.959
I saw her.

31:06.458 --> 31:08.875
I saw her sneaking out
of here late at night.

31:11.041 --> 31:11.792
When?

31:13.417 --> 31:14.375
About a week ago.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.500
I was in Denver at the opera

31:18.667 --> 31:20.667
and I had a headache
so I came home early.

31:24.417 --> 31:27.417
And my husband claims that he
didn't even know she was here.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.083
Adele, I'm so sorry.

31:34.083 --> 31:36.583
My father warned me.

31:36.583 --> 31:39.583
Never marry a handsome
man, and I married two.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.792
I never met your
first husband.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.500
Uh, he was gone before Julian
and I came back to Elk Park.

31:53.750 --> 31:57.041
Gone as in?

31:57.041 --> 31:58.250
There's someone at the gate.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.083
Would you excuse me?

31:59.083 --> 32:00.208
Of course, yeah.

32:14.542 --> 32:17.709
Miss Barry, you tell me
this was a coincidence?

32:17.709 --> 32:19.375
- I was just-
- Detective?

32:19.375 --> 32:22.375
I've just been advised by my
husband not to speak to you.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.709
Seriously?

32:23.709 --> 32:25.625
I wouldn't joke
about legal matters.

32:27.125 --> 32:29.834
Look, I just, I just wanna
ask you a couple questions.

32:29.834 --> 32:31.792
And you're perfectly
welcome to do that.

32:31.792 --> 32:34.625
I'll have my attorney contact
you and schedule a meeting.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.041
Goldy, thank you so much.

32:38.041 --> 32:38.959
No worries.

32:44.083 --> 32:45.417
What are you doing here?

32:45.417 --> 32:46.458
Getting paid for yesterday.

32:46.458 --> 32:47.583
Oh, yeah, really.

32:47.583 --> 32:48.583
No, seriously.

32:48.583 --> 32:49.500
Look. See?

32:53.875 --> 32:55.166
So you're telling me
you didn't come here

32:55.166 --> 32:57.834
because of what you told
me you saw her doing?

32:57.834 --> 33:00.667
I will tell you that,
and I will tell you more.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.000
Just not here.

33:07.667 --> 33:08.500
Fine.

33:09.417 --> 33:10.250
Follow me.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.750
As you can see, there's
a lot you don't know

33:28.750 --> 33:30.959
that goes into solving a crime,

33:30.959 --> 33:32.458
which is why I need
you to stop trying

33:32.458 --> 33:33.625
to do my job for me.

33:40.125 --> 33:42.375
Look, I'm not
trying to do your job.

33:42.375 --> 33:47.208
I care about Laura and
about what happened to her.

33:47.208 --> 33:49.125
And I know this community.

33:54.625 --> 33:55.792
What did you want to tell me?

33:55.792 --> 33:57.166
So after you
mentioned Julian to me,

33:57.166 --> 33:59.625
I went to ask a
friend about him, and-

33:59.625 --> 34:02.083
You told somebody I
was looking into Julian?

34:02.083 --> 34:03.959
Oh, give me some
credit, Detective, no.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.417
I just asked a friend.

34:05.417 --> 34:06.250
Name?

34:06.250 --> 34:07.083
Brad Bowman.

34:07.083 --> 34:08.333
He's a teacher.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.417
Teaches history and
was at the luncheon.

34:10.417 --> 34:12.333
Yeah, give me some
credit, Miss Barry.

34:13.834 --> 34:17.166
Well, I asked Brad if
he had ever taught Julian,

34:17.166 --> 34:19.750
but he said that he
actually saw Julian

34:19.750 --> 34:22.250
in the parking lot
after the luncheon.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.834
Yeah, I know, I know.

34:23.834 --> 34:26.333
Dr. Gentle saw him there, too.

34:28.417 --> 34:30.333
So that's why you
asked me about him.

34:31.583 --> 34:35.333
Well, Brad also said
that he asked Julian

34:35.333 --> 34:37.333
what he was doing there
and he said that he was

34:37.333 --> 34:39.875
waiting on someone
and he was standing

34:39.875 --> 34:41.417
right in front of Laura's car.

34:41.417 --> 34:44.333
Yeah, Dr. Smiley
invited him there.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.667
How do you know that?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.458
'Cause she sent him an email.

34:48.458 --> 34:49.792
What did the email say?

34:49.792 --> 34:51.792
I'm not discussing
this with you, okay?

34:51.792 --> 34:53.208
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.834
Thank you very much, Miss Barry.

34:57.208 --> 34:58.625
There's just one more thing.

34:58.625 --> 34:59.500
Um.

35:00.875 --> 35:04.458
I did go to Adele's house
to pick up my check.

35:04.458 --> 35:08.500
But also, she has a desk
drawer in her office

35:08.500 --> 35:10.542
full of prescription medications,

35:10.542 --> 35:13.667
and she tried to convince me
that Laura took her own life,

35:13.667 --> 35:16.166
and I am pretty sure
that her ex-husband

35:16.166 --> 35:17.291
was unfaithful to her.

35:20.625 --> 35:23.875
Where did Adele live before
she came back to Elk Park?

35:23.875 --> 35:24.709
Salt Lake.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.083
Whoa.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.917
Mr. Geddes' car

35:42.500 --> 35:43.917
found by hikers.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.750
He drove off a cliff.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.834
Vincent Geddes seems like-

35:59.834 --> 36:02.709
A con artist who married
rich and sponged off his wife?

36:04.166 --> 36:06.083
You know, Adele filed for
divorce a couple months

36:06.083 --> 36:08.750
before the crash and
then she rescinded it.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.125
Why?

36:11.125 --> 36:12.458
Well, maybe they made up.

36:13.959 --> 36:16.542
Or maybe she didn't
file a prenup.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.875
I bet I could
find out from Adele.

36:22.250 --> 36:24.959
And she won't have her lawyers
there when I talk to her.

36:26.625 --> 36:27.792
Miss Barry.

36:27.792 --> 36:29.792
You gotta stop
with the Miss Barry.

36:29.792 --> 36:30.959
It's Goldy.

36:30.959 --> 36:31.959
Okay, Goldy.

36:34.166 --> 36:36.125
I realize you might think
you're in a position to help.

36:36.125 --> 36:38.291
I am in a position to help.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.792
People talk to
me, they trust me.

36:40.792 --> 36:42.333
And I've already helped you.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.542
Well, I don't need your help.

36:46.375 --> 36:47.417
Oh, am I interrupting?

36:47.417 --> 36:48.291
Yes.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.250
Call me if you need more help.

36:55.458 --> 36:56.625
Good to see you, Mason.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.333
More help with what?

37:02.917 --> 37:03.917
This case.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.166
Oh.

37:06.166 --> 37:08.333
Well, she is very helpful.

37:10.417 --> 37:11.250
I, I...

37:12.250 --> 37:13.083
Drop.

37:18.917 --> 37:19.834
Hey, Mar.

37:19.834 --> 37:20.917
Hey, Goldy.

37:20.917 --> 37:23.291
I am so sorry about Laura.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.500
Yeah, it's awful.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.333
I'll swing by her house to
make sure everything's okay.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.333
You know?

37:29.333 --> 37:31.041
Trying to stay proactive.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.208
Hmm, well, speaking
of proactive,

37:33.208 --> 37:35.458
I was talking to
Archie Dennison.

37:35.458 --> 37:38.125
Yes, I cleaned up
the glass, remember?

37:38.125 --> 37:39.333
No, just now.

37:39.333 --> 37:41.458
Actually, we had lunch.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.583
Marla, he is after you.

37:43.583 --> 37:45.542
Well, and I'm after a job.

37:45.542 --> 37:48.458
So I know that we were both
invited to Adele's birthday,

37:48.458 --> 37:50.959
but how would you
like to work it?

37:50.959 --> 37:52.542
Seriously?

37:52.542 --> 37:55.500
Yeah, Archie had a different
caterer and florist set up.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.041
He was so wowed with the
luncheon that I convinced him

37:58.041 --> 37:59.875
to go with us.

37:59.875 --> 38:01.709
Now I know it's coming up
fast and you're gonna have to

38:01.709 --> 38:03.291
spend a little bit more time
at their house, but I'm-

38:03.291 --> 38:04.375
I'll take it.

38:05.792 --> 38:07.792
Oh, that was easy.

38:07.792 --> 38:10.375
Shall we make a plan
over dinner, chez you?

38:10.375 --> 38:12.208
As long as you
bring me flowers.

38:12.208 --> 38:13.375
Of course.

38:13.375 --> 38:14.750
I'll see you tonight.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.500
Bye.

39:41.041 --> 39:42.083
Pick up, come on.

39:42.083 --> 39:44.000
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.125
Goldy.

39:45.125 --> 39:46.333
- I'm in Laura's house.
- What?

39:46.333 --> 39:48.333
And somebody else is
in the house, upstairs.

39:48.333 --> 39:49.208
What are you doing?

39:49.208 --> 39:50.834
And I'm hiding in the closet.

39:50.834 --> 39:52.667
Stay there and stay hidden.

39:52.667 --> 39:53.834
I'm on the way.

39:53.834 --> 39:55.000
They're banging around.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.625
I think they're
looking for something.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.333
I just, I can't see.

39:58.333 --> 39:59.875
If I could just get
a little closer.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.083
Stay there and don't hang up.

40:02.083 --> 40:02.959
Okay, okay.

40:04.583 --> 40:06.041
Hey, hey!

40:06.041 --> 40:07.542
We need a patrol car on Laura
Smiley's house right now.

40:07.542 --> 40:08.625
Sirens and lights.

40:10.166 --> 40:11.417
Yeah, we're comin'.

40:11.417 --> 40:12.250
Okay.

40:20.375 --> 40:21.208
We're rolling.

40:21.208 --> 40:22.041
Stay put.

40:41.709 --> 40:43.709
They're leaving.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.458
We're almost there.

40:45.458 --> 40:50.458
Okay.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.291
Better?

40:54.667 --> 40:55.542
Thank you, yeah.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.333
Well, you
were definitely
trespassing this time.

41:06.250 --> 41:07.375
You gonna arrest me?

41:09.125 --> 41:10.041
Don't tempt me.

41:18.000 --> 41:18.917
Did they take anything?

41:18.917 --> 41:20.917
No, no, nothing important.

41:22.250 --> 41:24.917
We'd already been here yesterday
and took all of her files.

41:24.917 --> 41:25.792
Her laptop?

41:25.792 --> 41:26.667
At the station.

41:32.291 --> 41:33.750
I wanna show you something.

41:37.959 --> 41:41.041
I promise, that key was
not there when I got here.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.208
Well, you know
what that means.

41:45.625 --> 41:46.875
That whoever broke in
the house knew that there

41:46.875 --> 41:48.083
was a key under there.

41:48.083 --> 41:48.959
Well, I knew because
I water her plants

41:48.959 --> 41:50.208
when she's out of town.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.417
And you haven't
told anybody else?

41:51.417 --> 41:54.000
No.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.208
Ah, there she is.

41:57.041 --> 41:58.917
Tell her how many
goals you've scored?

41:58.917 --> 41:59.792
Yeah.

41:59.792 --> 42:00.875
You gonna brag?

42:00.875 --> 42:03.709
Maybe.

42:03.709 --> 42:05.750
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, ugh.

42:06.583 --> 42:08.083
Ah, that's okay.

42:08.083 --> 42:11.792
I was just in surgery and
handed over the scalpel.

42:11.792 --> 42:13.417
He's kidding, Mom.

42:13.417 --> 42:16.083
He was five minutes away
when you texted him.

42:16.083 --> 42:17.542
Guys.

42:17.542 --> 42:18.792
We were with Owen.

42:18.792 --> 42:21.083
We were scouting the
wellness center site.

42:21.083 --> 42:22.041
Wow.

42:22.041 --> 42:23.792
You guys have land already.

42:23.792 --> 42:26.458
Yeah, Goldy, I told you,
we're serious about this.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.417
Well, thanks for being here.

42:30.417 --> 42:31.834
Ah, don't worry about it.

42:31.834 --> 42:34.166
You've got a lot going on.

42:34.166 --> 42:35.166
You have no idea.

42:36.792 --> 42:38.542
And I just got a new gig.

42:38.542 --> 42:40.125
Adele Dennison's birthday party.

42:40.125 --> 42:41.417
Wow.

42:41.417 --> 42:44.083
Means I am already a
week behind.

42:44.083 --> 42:45.875
Okay, I'll tell you what.

42:45.875 --> 42:49.083
What would you think about
staying at Dad's house tonight?

42:49.083 --> 42:50.333
Can we order Vietnamese?

42:50.333 --> 42:52.166
Anything you want.

42:52.166 --> 42:53.166
Ah, you don't have to.

42:53.166 --> 42:54.750
No, I know, but I want to.

42:56.458 --> 42:57.333
Go on.

42:57.333 --> 42:58.166
Give your mom a hug.

42:58.166 --> 42:58.959
Let's head out.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.875
Well, as lousy as
he was as a husband,

43:07.875 --> 43:10.041
Richard is really
coming through as a dad.

43:10.041 --> 43:12.458
Well, Olive has
this magical power

43:12.458 --> 43:14.709
of making him forget
his gigantic ego.

43:16.291 --> 43:18.208
Well, he could've used
all of it at the luncheon.

43:18.208 --> 43:20.500
He can really go off on people.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.208
Don't ever let
him do that to you.

43:22.208 --> 43:24.125
Oh, I am not talking about me.

43:25.458 --> 43:26.291
Who?

43:27.458 --> 43:29.625
Okay, don't get upset,
but toward the end

43:29.625 --> 43:31.375
I was taking out some
trash and I saw him

43:31.375 --> 43:32.792
and Laura arguing.

43:34.208 --> 43:35.208
About what?

43:36.458 --> 43:37.375
I don't know.

43:37.375 --> 43:38.834
I was too far away to hear.

43:38.834 --> 43:39.709
Hmm.

43:40.750 --> 43:42.500
All right, all right, ready?

43:42.500 --> 43:45.959
Yes, please.

43:45.959 --> 43:46.834
Oh my goodness.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.041
What is in this?

43:49.041 --> 43:50.208
Guess.

43:50.208 --> 43:51.750
Okay, well, um.

43:51.750 --> 43:54.250
Tomatoes, obviously.

43:54.250 --> 43:56.208
Oh, I'll get it.

43:56.208 --> 43:57.083
Okay.

44:01.709 --> 44:02.542
Mmm.

44:05.417 --> 44:06.250
Detective.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.834
Did you come to arrest me?

44:11.500 --> 44:13.917
I'm beginning to think
you wanna be arrested.

44:15.583 --> 44:19.333
I came to tell you that I
got the medical examiner

44:19.333 --> 44:20.583
to come back a day early.

44:21.875 --> 44:23.500
Autopsy's gonna
be done tomorrow.

44:26.166 --> 44:27.000
Okay.

44:29.041 --> 44:29.959
Goldy.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.709
You gonna introduce me?

44:33.750 --> 44:36.125
Um, this is
Detective Tom Shultz.

44:36.125 --> 44:38.208
Tom, this is my friend Marla.

44:40.208 --> 44:42.542
Um, Marla McGuire.

44:42.542 --> 44:44.917
You did the flowers
for the luncheon.

44:44.917 --> 44:46.750
I did.

44:46.750 --> 44:49.041
Did you wanna question me or?

44:50.625 --> 44:53.000
Marla and I are working
on a party for Saturday

44:53.000 --> 44:55.041
for Adele Dennison.

44:55.041 --> 44:56.250
Oh, you should come.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.041
You know what? I should come.

45:01.041 --> 45:02.375
But she'll never invite me.

45:04.458 --> 45:08.000
I'll let you two get back
to what you were doing.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.583
Nice to meet you.

45:09.583 --> 45:10.417
You, too.

45:11.834 --> 45:13.000
Goodnight, Detective.

45:14.291 --> 45:15.583
Okay.

45:19.417 --> 45:20.917
Um.

45:20.917 --> 45:22.875
When were you gonna tell me
about this cute detective

45:22.875 --> 45:24.333
that has a little crush on you?

45:24.333 --> 45:25.291
He does not.

45:25.291 --> 45:26.834
I'm helping him with something.

45:26.834 --> 45:28.333
Uh-huh.

45:28.333 --> 45:30.166
I am, and it would be
weird and unprofessional,

45:30.166 --> 45:33.083
and besides, I'm going out
with Brad Bowman on Friday.

45:33.083 --> 45:35.500
Oh, and you don't
think that's weird?

45:35.500 --> 45:36.875
Because he's Olive's teacher?

45:36.875 --> 45:38.750
No, because of him and Laura.

45:38.750 --> 45:40.208
Him and Laura what?

45:40.208 --> 45:41.667
He's Laura's ex.

45:41.667 --> 45:42.917
She didn't tell you that?

45:45.750 --> 45:46.583
No.

45:48.875 --> 45:50.500
And neither did he.

45:54.291 --> 45:56.041
How does, how
does Marla know this?

45:56.041 --> 45:57.709
She said Laura
told her years ago

45:57.709 --> 45:59.667
when she first moved to town.

45:59.667 --> 46:01.000
And Laura never told you?

46:01.000 --> 46:01.875
Nope.

46:03.041 --> 46:05.375
Maybe it wasn't a
big deal to Laura.

46:05.375 --> 46:06.917
You know what?

46:06.917 --> 46:08.375
Maybe, I don't know, maybe
I could do some more digging

46:08.375 --> 46:10.000
tomorrow night.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.166
Tomorrow night?

46:11.166 --> 46:12.792
What do you, what do
you have tomorrow night?

46:13.750 --> 46:16.000
Brad and I are having dinner.

46:19.500 --> 46:20.333
Oh.

46:21.500 --> 46:23.625
Unless you think
it's a bad idea.

46:25.166 --> 46:27.166
No, I don't think
it's a bad idea.

46:31.375 --> 46:34.834
Where's this dinner
taking place?

46:34.834 --> 46:35.667
The Bistro.

46:37.166 --> 46:38.041
You know it?

46:39.083 --> 46:41.417
Yeah, yeah, yup, heard of it.

46:44.875 --> 46:45.750
Hey.

46:46.583 --> 46:48.083
Maybe you could be there, too.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.500
I don't think Brad
wants me at your dinner.

46:53.500 --> 46:55.500
No, no, not, not with us.

46:55.500 --> 46:58.834
You know, just in case
he, he tells me something

46:58.834 --> 47:01.083
and I have to tell
you something or...

47:03.041 --> 47:03.875
Something.

47:08.417 --> 47:09.667
Yeah, okay.

47:09.667 --> 47:12.917
But you know, um, I
should bring a date.

47:14.875 --> 47:15.709
- Oh.
- Mason.

47:17.458 --> 47:19.417
I'm taking you to
dinner tomorrow night.

47:19.417 --> 47:20.291
Me?

47:35.041 --> 47:36.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.542
I have to tell you,
I was over the moon

47:39.542 --> 47:41.625
when I found out Archie
had this inspired notion

47:41.625 --> 47:42.959
to get you to handle the event.

47:42.959 --> 47:44.250
Ah, me, too.

47:44.250 --> 47:45.625
Although I was looking
forward to getting

47:45.625 --> 47:46.917
dressed up to attend.

47:46.917 --> 47:48.375
Oh, you'll still be attending.

47:48.375 --> 47:50.291
No, no, no, no,
no, I'll be working.

47:50.291 --> 47:52.208
You'll be working
in a dual capacity,

47:52.208 --> 47:56.291
so you can get dressed
up and bring a plus one.

47:57.583 --> 47:59.000
You're the boss.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Literally.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.750
So, how can I help you?

48:02.750 --> 48:04.000
I have the guest list.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.917
I just need to scout,
make a detailed plan.

48:05.917 --> 48:08.166
I won't trouble you unless
I have any questions.

48:08.166 --> 48:10.667
Sounds like we're
in excellent hands.

48:10.667 --> 48:11.750
I'll let you get to it.

48:11.750 --> 48:12.583
Thank you.

49:07.125 --> 49:07.959
Hello?

50:02.000 --> 50:02.875
Hi.

50:02.875 --> 50:03.750
Oh!

50:04.583 --> 50:05.458
Archie!

50:06.500 --> 50:08.291
Oh, you startled me.

50:08.291 --> 50:09.291
Whoops, sorry.

50:09.291 --> 50:12.417
Oh, it's okay.

50:12.417 --> 50:16.208
Um, do you, do you know
if this oven works?

50:16.208 --> 50:18.959
Eh, well, we'd get it
fixed if the current tenant

50:18.959 --> 50:20.291
would do any cooking.

50:21.417 --> 50:22.709
Oh.

50:22.709 --> 50:24.458
Is this where your
stepson is staying?

50:26.208 --> 50:27.542
Oh. It's okay.

50:27.542 --> 50:29.125
I actually think
this will work better

50:29.125 --> 50:31.667
for a staging area for my crew.

50:31.667 --> 50:33.959
Do you think Julian will mind?

50:33.959 --> 50:36.291
Maybe I can use it as
an excuse to evict him.

50:37.291 --> 50:39.583
Yes, I know, I'm awful.

50:39.583 --> 50:41.709
Truth is, I should be
grateful to Julian.

50:41.709 --> 50:43.291
His troubles are what
inspired me to build

50:43.291 --> 50:44.417
the wellness center.

50:45.667 --> 50:47.625
Oh, I guess I
thought Richard had-

50:47.625 --> 50:49.000
No, no.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.583
I wanted to bring
in medical partners.

50:50.583 --> 50:52.083
- Yeah.
- As I told Owen,

50:52.083 --> 50:53.500
it's my vision.

50:53.500 --> 50:56.166
A state-of-the-art treatment
facility for anyone

50:56.166 --> 50:57.834
battling the illness
of addiction.

50:59.208 --> 51:00.250
Like the Betty Ford Center.

51:00.250 --> 51:01.417
Exactly.

51:01.417 --> 51:03.750
We'll have capacity
for 100 residents.

51:03.750 --> 51:04.583
Wow.

51:05.750 --> 51:06.750
That's amazing.

51:08.542 --> 51:12.750
So I'm assuming then that
Julian will be at the party.

51:12.750 --> 51:13.792
Who knows?

51:13.792 --> 51:15.959
He's as reliable as the wind.

51:15.959 --> 51:17.583
Adele's been trying
to reach him for days.

51:17.583 --> 51:18.750
No answer.

51:20.500 --> 51:22.083
And speak of the wife.

51:24.000 --> 51:24.834
Hello, darling.

51:24.834 --> 51:25.667
Just helping Goldy.

51:28.000 --> 51:28.834
On my way.

51:30.291 --> 51:31.125
Excuse me.

51:37.208 --> 51:38.041
Do you mind?

51:38.041 --> 51:38.875
It's a bit warm in here.

51:38.875 --> 51:39.792
Not at all.

51:46.542 --> 51:48.000
Miss Langsam.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.125
Detective Tom Shultz.

51:49.125 --> 51:50.041
Sarah's fine.

51:50.041 --> 51:51.792
And this is my husband.

51:51.792 --> 51:54.667
Archie Dennison,
this is Deputy Kildea.

51:54.667 --> 51:55.500
Mason.

51:57.291 --> 51:58.542
My first name, Mason.

51:59.709 --> 52:02.000
I thought we were all
saying our first names.

52:02.000 --> 52:02.792
Sorry.

52:06.375 --> 52:07.750
Mind if we take a seat?

52:07.750 --> 52:08.667
Please.

52:12.667 --> 52:14.417
Well, thank you
for seeing us today.

52:14.417 --> 52:16.250
As I said on the phone,
we're viewing this

52:16.250 --> 52:18.667
as a suspicious death.

52:18.667 --> 52:20.917
I'm not sure what's
suspicious about it.

52:20.917 --> 52:23.333
She was a deeply troubled woman
who decided to end it all.

52:23.333 --> 52:24.834
What makes you say that?

52:26.083 --> 52:27.667
Well, isn't it obvious?

52:27.667 --> 52:29.000
Can you be more specific?

52:30.583 --> 52:33.000
Uh, I didn't know
her terribly well.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.834
Well, you knew her
well enough to diagnose

52:34.834 --> 52:35.667
her mental state, though.

52:35.667 --> 52:36.500
Detective.

52:38.834 --> 52:40.917
How well did you
know her, Mr. Dennison?

52:43.250 --> 52:44.834
Only socially.

52:44.834 --> 52:47.750
Ah, 'cause a week
ago, Mrs. Dennison,

52:47.750 --> 52:50.208
didn't you see Dr. Smiley
leaving here late at night?

52:50.208 --> 52:51.542
Do you have
an eyewitness to that?

52:51.542 --> 52:53.125
Mrs. Dennison told
several people that.

52:53.125 --> 52:54.792
So no eyewitness.

52:54.792 --> 52:56.583
I'd consider it idle
gossip not worthy of

52:56.583 --> 52:57.792
your taxpayer funded time.

52:57.792 --> 52:59.917
Well, gossip starts
somewhere, right?

52:59.917 --> 53:02.125
And I'm afraid
it started with me.

53:02.125 --> 53:02.959
Adele.

53:04.792 --> 53:07.208
I imagined an affair.

53:07.208 --> 53:09.709
Did you imagine the same
thing with your first husband?

53:12.375 --> 53:13.208
Vincent?

53:14.667 --> 53:16.291
I'd love to speak to Vincent,

53:17.875 --> 53:19.709
but that's not possible.

53:19.709 --> 53:21.709
I'm not sure what
Adele's prior marriage

53:21.709 --> 53:22.917
has to do with any of this.

53:22.917 --> 53:24.417
You haven't told
your attorney, Adele?

53:29.542 --> 53:32.834
Vincent Geddes was
killed in a car accident.

53:34.792 --> 53:37.959
The kind where the
car falls off a cliff.

53:37.959 --> 53:38.917
This interview's over.

53:38.917 --> 53:40.291
Hold on a second, okay?

53:40.291 --> 53:42.917
Detective, my clients
have nothing further to say.

53:42.917 --> 53:45.667
So unless they're under
arrest, I'll show you both out.

53:57.625 --> 53:58.458
We'll be in touch.

53:58.458 --> 53:59.417
You have my number.

54:06.417 --> 54:07.583
He was accusing you-

54:07.583 --> 54:10.166
Yes, of killing Vincent.

54:10.166 --> 54:11.583
Archie, I figured that out.

54:13.625 --> 54:15.208
And of killing Laura.

54:18.709 --> 54:22.166
My darling Archie, what
possible motive would I have

54:22.166 --> 54:23.625
for killing Laura?

54:23.625 --> 54:25.875
You told me there was nothing
between the two of you.

54:25.875 --> 54:26.709
There wasn't.

54:28.000 --> 54:28.834
But

54:30.291 --> 54:31.542
hypothetically,

54:32.834 --> 54:36.000
if I did discover that you lied,

54:36.000 --> 54:39.333
then I guess I would
just simply divorce you,

54:39.333 --> 54:41.333
as per our prenuptial agreement.

54:44.291 --> 54:45.458
All that money.

54:48.000 --> 54:48.834
Gone.

54:52.291 --> 54:55.583
And that is a lot
of money to lose.

54:59.792 --> 55:01.041
That would be a
perfect motive for you

55:01.041 --> 55:03.166
to keep Laura
quiet, wouldn't it?

55:09.083 --> 55:10.250
Take this, will you?

55:14.083 --> 55:15.333
I'm heading to book club.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.208
I'm
heading to book club.

55:43.250 --> 55:44.959
He threw the glass?

55:44.959 --> 55:48.291
He threw his glass,
and it was nice crystal.

55:48.291 --> 55:50.750
Well, I mean,
Adele did it, right?

55:50.750 --> 55:52.291
Deputy.

55:52.291 --> 55:53.250
But the way Archie lost it
like that, maybe he did it.

55:53.250 --> 55:54.166
Mason.

55:54.166 --> 55:55.333
And what happened to Julian?

55:55.333 --> 55:56.709
Maybe he's dead, too!
- Mason.

55:57.792 --> 55:59.875
Sorry, I got excited.

55:59.875 --> 56:01.375
Never been part of a
homicide investigation.

56:01.375 --> 56:02.750
And you still might
not be when we're waiting

56:02.750 --> 56:03.875
on the autopsy results.

56:03.875 --> 56:05.417
Well, yeah.

56:05.417 --> 56:08.291
Sure, but you said it
was a suspicious death,

56:08.291 --> 56:09.959
and now it's really
suspicious with these two.

56:09.959 --> 56:11.875
Yeah, and now they
won't talk to me.

56:14.709 --> 56:16.291
Why don't you come to
Adele's birthday party

56:16.291 --> 56:17.917
with me as my plus one?

56:17.917 --> 56:19.750
- Could he do that?
- You're gonna do that?

56:19.750 --> 56:21.750
The invitation
said you and a guest.

56:23.959 --> 56:25.250
Do I have to wear a tux?

56:26.166 --> 56:27.166
Fresh tie will do.

56:28.750 --> 56:30.291
Anyway.

56:30.291 --> 56:32.667
I have to go talk to
my daughter's father.

56:37.208 --> 56:38.500
She's divorced.

56:39.667 --> 56:41.417
That's why she
said it like that.

56:41.417 --> 56:43.417
I know that.

56:43.417 --> 56:44.667
I think it looks nice.

56:53.458 --> 56:54.291
Enter.

56:58.792 --> 56:59.625
Uh-oh.

57:00.458 --> 57:02.083
Am I in trouble?

57:02.083 --> 57:03.875
Now why would you assume that?

57:08.166 --> 57:09.667
Skier?

57:09.667 --> 57:12.625
No, snowboarder, but that
was from a car accident.

57:12.625 --> 57:13.500
Oh, no.

57:13.500 --> 57:14.709
He okay?

57:14.709 --> 57:17.875
She, and she will
be when I'm done.

57:19.375 --> 57:22.542
Okay, really though,
am I in trouble?

57:23.709 --> 57:25.375
Not trouble, no.

57:26.959 --> 57:28.625
Um.

57:28.625 --> 57:29.709
I just, uh.

57:35.625 --> 57:38.125
Were you and Laura fighting
outside the dining hall

57:38.125 --> 57:39.166
the day of the luncheon?

57:39.166 --> 57:40.458
Wow.

57:40.458 --> 57:41.375
Seriously?

57:41.375 --> 57:44.709
I'm just asking a question.

57:44.709 --> 57:47.500
Oh, just like old
times when you would

57:47.500 --> 57:50.041
just ask a question
that sounded a lot more

57:50.041 --> 57:51.834
like an accusation.

57:53.417 --> 57:54.834
This is not about us.

57:54.834 --> 57:55.959
- No?
- No.

57:55.959 --> 57:58.083
Okay, well, um.

57:58.083 --> 58:00.000
I wasn't fighting with Laura.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.709
I was just passionately
conveying an opinion.

58:03.709 --> 58:04.917
Okay.

58:04.917 --> 58:06.166
What about?

58:06.166 --> 58:08.500
I was concerned
about all the rumors

58:08.500 --> 58:10.917
and gossip about her and
Archie and how it might

58:10.917 --> 58:12.417
impact the wellness center.

58:14.625 --> 58:18.166
I can fix bones in a few hours,

58:18.166 --> 58:20.834
but what Owen does,
it takes longer.

58:20.834 --> 58:22.250
He fixes lives.

58:24.250 --> 58:26.208
Did you know that his
mother was an addict?

58:26.208 --> 58:27.375
I didn't.

58:27.375 --> 58:28.625
Yeah, he was
gonna be a surgeon,

58:28.625 --> 58:30.792
but when she died, he
switched to psychiatry.

58:32.208 --> 58:34.959
The man is on a mission and
I'm doing whatever I can

58:34.959 --> 58:35.875
to help him.

58:37.041 --> 58:39.875
As I passionately
conveyed to Laura,

58:39.875 --> 58:43.583
more people need access to
what her and Owen actually do.

58:44.458 --> 58:47.625
And I'm living proof of that.

58:51.041 --> 58:52.083
You're in therapy.

58:53.208 --> 58:54.041
Yeah.

58:56.792 --> 58:58.291
Good for you.

58:58.291 --> 59:01.208
Yeah, well, maybe I
should've done it long ago

59:01.208 --> 59:02.750
like you wanted me to.

59:03.875 --> 59:05.917
Things might've turned
out differently.

59:11.583 --> 59:14.625
Well, how did, um, how did
things turn out with Laura?

59:14.625 --> 59:16.166
Well, I didn't get a
chance to talk to her

59:16.166 --> 59:18.667
and she got a call
from a patient.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Goldy, what is with
all the questions?

59:23.750 --> 59:24.792
I'm sorry.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.083
I'm just trying to
understand how my friend...

59:32.583 --> 59:33.500
Of course.

59:34.917 --> 59:37.250
Look, I'm sorry.

59:39.083 --> 59:41.041
You know, the one
thing that I've learned

59:41.041 --> 59:44.625
from all of this therapy is
that life is like a mystery

59:44.625 --> 59:48.625
and sometimes you just
have to accept that.

1:00:05.166 --> 1:00:06.834
- Shultz.
- Hey, it's Goldy.

1:00:06.834 --> 1:00:09.709
So, my ex-husband did talk
to Laura after the luncheon

1:00:09.709 --> 1:00:11.458
before she got in
her car and left.

1:00:11.458 --> 1:00:12.667
Did he see something?

1:00:12.667 --> 1:00:14.375
No, but he did say
that she received a call

1:00:14.375 --> 1:00:15.667
from a patient.

1:00:15.667 --> 1:00:17.417
Around what time?

1:00:17.417 --> 1:00:19.291
Probably 4:00ish.

1:00:19.291 --> 1:00:20.458
Hey, Mason.

1:00:20.458 --> 1:00:21.375
You're looking at
incoming calls, right?

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:22.875
Yeah, what do you need?

1:00:22.875 --> 1:00:24.208
Check out a call before
the crash around 4:00.

1:00:27.208 --> 1:00:28.333
Hey, this number.

1:00:28.333 --> 1:00:29.709
It's Julian Geddes' number.

1:00:30.875 --> 1:00:32.333
They talked for just a minute.

1:00:32.333 --> 1:00:33.291
It was Julian.

1:00:33.291 --> 1:00:34.417
They just talked for a minute.

1:00:34.417 --> 1:00:35.500
He was probably
calling her to tell her

1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:36.709
he was coming to
the parking lot.

1:00:36.709 --> 1:00:38.250
She got another call
nine minutes later.

1:00:39.208 --> 1:00:40.083
An unlisted number.

1:00:40.959 --> 1:00:42.500
This call was for 30 minutes.

1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:43.709
- Hang on.
- What?

1:00:43.709 --> 1:00:45.834
- Wait a second.
- What's going on?

1:00:45.834 --> 1:00:49.166
The distance from the school
to where she crashed, it's...

1:00:52.166 --> 1:00:53.000
Tom?

1:00:54.458 --> 1:00:56.166
I think we just figured
out that Laura was on a call

1:00:56.166 --> 1:00:58.250
with somebody when she
went off the cliff.

1:00:58.250 --> 1:00:59.792
With who?

1:00:59.792 --> 1:01:02.250
That's an excellent question.

1:01:04.083 --> 1:01:05.291
And Goldy's going
to ask Brad about

1:01:05.291 --> 1:01:07.333
his relationship with Laura.

1:01:07.333 --> 1:01:08.917
Shouldn't she
be wearing a wire?

1:01:09.917 --> 1:01:11.041
We're not there yet.

1:01:12.625 --> 1:01:13.458
They're here.

1:01:20.375 --> 1:01:23.375
I used to have a
major crush on Goldy

1:01:23.375 --> 1:01:24.542
when she was my babysitter.

1:01:24.542 --> 1:01:25.875
Really?

1:01:25.875 --> 1:01:27.208
She used to bring
me delicious treats

1:01:27.208 --> 1:01:28.792
she cooked in mason jars.

1:01:30.250 --> 1:01:32.250
Thought she had the jars
specifically made for me.

1:01:34.792 --> 1:01:38.375
I don't have a crush on her
anymore, for the record.

1:01:38.375 --> 1:01:39.500
Mmm.

1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:42.709
I mean, she's
cool, but, you know.

1:01:42.709 --> 1:01:44.458
Think we'd be a bad fit.

1:01:44.458 --> 1:01:45.792
Oh, yeah.

1:01:45.792 --> 1:01:47.709
Who would date a prep?

1:01:47.709 --> 1:01:49.375
Uh, technically, two.

1:01:49.375 --> 1:01:54.417
Um, I guess it just feels
like one.

1:01:54.417 --> 1:01:55.375
I have to confess.

1:01:55.375 --> 1:01:57.083
I'm a little bit disappointed.

1:01:59.083 --> 1:02:00.417
About what?

1:02:00.417 --> 1:02:02.250
I knew you were
going to Adele's,

1:02:02.250 --> 1:02:04.667
and I was really hoping
to dance with you.

1:02:04.667 --> 1:02:07.583
Well, that could still happen.

1:02:07.583 --> 1:02:09.083
Adele made me promise
that I would at least

1:02:09.083 --> 1:02:10.917
spend some time as a guest.

1:02:13.417 --> 1:02:15.125
They seem to be
having a nice time.

1:02:16.417 --> 1:02:19.000
Do you think she's into
him or just, you know,

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.291
playing along for
the investigation?

1:02:21.291 --> 1:02:22.625
You know her better than I do.

1:02:22.625 --> 1:02:23.500
Sure.

1:02:25.125 --> 1:02:26.500
I think she's playing along.

1:02:30.333 --> 1:02:31.625
He reminds me of Richard.

1:02:32.750 --> 1:02:34.041
He doesn't look
anything like Richard.

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:36.875
He's good-looking,
slick, well-dressed.

1:02:41.166 --> 1:02:42.375
And wrong for her.

1:02:43.333 --> 1:02:44.625
Yeah.

1:02:49.834 --> 1:02:54.834
Listen, I, um, I have to
ask you an awkward question.

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.375
As Olive has heard
me say a hundred times,

1:02:58.375 --> 1:03:01.041
I have never heard a question
that I didn't appreciate.

1:03:02.291 --> 1:03:03.792
Just ask.

1:03:03.792 --> 1:03:04.625
Okay.

1:03:06.625 --> 1:03:08.375
Is there any truth
to the rumor that you

1:03:08.375 --> 1:03:10.000
and Laura once dated?

1:03:12.333 --> 1:03:13.875
Oh, no.

1:03:13.875 --> 1:03:17.333
I think I just asked you a
question you didn't appreciate.

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:22.375
No, it's just
a pathetic story.

1:03:22.375 --> 1:03:23.750
I'll be the judge of that.

1:03:25.834 --> 1:03:28.750
Laura and I met
in Aspen, skiing.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.166
Cliche, I know, but
we really hit it off.

1:03:34.166 --> 1:03:36.500
We made it work for a
couple years long distance,

1:03:36.500 --> 1:03:39.583
and then she decided she
wanted to move to Elk Park.

1:03:39.583 --> 1:03:42.333
She said she just fell
in love with the place,

1:03:42.333 --> 1:03:45.750
but I thought it
was more than that,

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.417
and I bought a ring,

1:03:50.917 --> 1:03:54.417
which I returned a
couple days later.

1:03:57.834 --> 1:04:00.583
Well, that couldn't
have been easy.

1:04:00.583 --> 1:04:02.041
No.

1:04:02.041 --> 1:04:04.041
And I'm sure it was
even harder when she took

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:05.375
the school counseling job.

1:04:06.542 --> 1:04:07.375
I handled it.

1:04:12.208 --> 1:04:13.542
Ah.

1:04:13.542 --> 1:04:16.041
Now you owe me a
painful romance story.

1:04:16.041 --> 1:04:20.208
I have one or two of
those stories.

1:04:20.208 --> 1:04:21.375
Well, ante up.

1:04:22.625 --> 1:04:24.208
I, uh, I definitely will.

1:04:25.208 --> 1:04:26.875
I'll be back.

1:04:35.959 --> 1:04:36.875
What's going on?

1:04:36.875 --> 1:04:37.917
The autopsy came back.

1:04:37.917 --> 1:04:39.333
The crash didn't kill her.

1:04:40.709 --> 1:04:42.417
She was poisoned.

1:04:50.792 --> 1:04:53.750
The ME said the poison
was water hemlock,

1:04:53.750 --> 1:04:56.917
which apparently grows
all over the place here.

1:04:56.917 --> 1:04:59.083
I'm having forensics test the
chocolate-covered shortbread

1:04:59.083 --> 1:05:00.834
that was in the front
seat of her car.

1:05:00.834 --> 1:05:02.834
Chocolate is a great
masker of flavor.

1:05:04.083 --> 1:05:05.667
Wait a minute, you
don't think that?

1:05:05.667 --> 1:05:06.917
You're the killer?

1:05:06.917 --> 1:05:08.125
You've been helping me
in the investigation

1:05:08.125 --> 1:05:09.583
because you wanna get caught?

1:05:11.667 --> 1:05:12.583
No. Okay?

1:05:14.250 --> 1:05:17.417
But there's no question
that there is a killer now.

1:05:19.417 --> 1:05:23.625
And hemlock takes 30
minutes to take effect.

1:05:23.625 --> 1:05:25.041
Laura was on the
phone with someone for-

1:05:25.041 --> 1:05:26.917
30 minutes.

1:05:26.917 --> 1:05:29.208
Yeah, and since nobody
came forward after her death,

1:05:29.208 --> 1:05:31.083
I'm assuming the killer
was on the phone with her-

1:05:31.083 --> 1:05:32.291
To make sure that she died.

1:05:32.291 --> 1:05:33.125
Yeah.

1:05:35.458 --> 1:05:36.375
That is awful.

1:05:38.333 --> 1:05:39.959
Well, Brad, Brad
just admitted to me

1:05:39.959 --> 1:05:43.792
that he proposed to Laura
and she turned him down.

1:05:44.875 --> 1:05:46.125
I mean, he was trying
to joke about it,

1:05:46.125 --> 1:05:48.375
but it was clearly
still painful to him.

1:05:48.375 --> 1:05:50.709
I mean, do you think that he?

1:05:51.625 --> 1:05:53.041
I have to look into it.

1:05:55.792 --> 1:05:56.625
God.

1:05:58.291 --> 1:06:01.542
You should, you
should probably get
back to your dinner.

1:06:01.542 --> 1:06:02.917
I've lost my appetite.

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:10.208
I'm so sorry.

1:06:10.208 --> 1:06:11.667
It's Olive, I need to go.

1:06:11.667 --> 1:06:13.000
Okay, let's
get out of here.

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:14.250
Olive needs you.

1:06:14.250 --> 1:06:15.125
You're just being a great mom.

1:06:15.125 --> 1:06:16.417
But you still owe me a story.

1:06:17.375 --> 1:06:19.583
Tomorrow, while we're dancing.

1:06:19.583 --> 1:06:20.667
That sounds great.

1:06:21.667 --> 1:06:22.458
Thank you.

1:06:22.458 --> 1:06:23.542
You're welcome.

1:06:23.542 --> 1:06:24.375
Goodnight.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:47.041
I just, I thought
I'd check in on you.

1:06:48.709 --> 1:06:49.583
Thank you.

1:06:51.875 --> 1:06:55.792
I'm actually, um, doing
an impression of you.

1:07:02.458 --> 1:07:04.709
So these are for
the party tomorrow.

1:07:04.709 --> 1:07:08.083
They're not quite as
visual as your board.

1:07:08.083 --> 1:07:09.542
I like what you're
doing here, though.

1:07:09.542 --> 1:07:10.709
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1:07:10.709 --> 1:07:12.333
Well, I'm just
trying to figure out

1:07:12.333 --> 1:07:15.291
who was at the luncheon that
had access to the shortbread.

1:07:15.291 --> 1:07:16.875
All of them?

1:07:16.875 --> 1:07:18.917
When it was on
the buffet, yes,

1:07:18.917 --> 1:07:21.125
but that was in plain sight.

1:07:22.542 --> 1:07:24.208
How about before you brought
them out to the buffet?

1:07:24.208 --> 1:07:28.583
Well, I was in the
kitchen with Brad,

1:07:28.583 --> 1:07:31.834
but we were together
the entire time.

1:07:31.834 --> 1:07:33.250
But then-

1:07:33.250 --> 1:07:34.458
What?

1:07:34.458 --> 1:07:35.917
Well, I just, I went
out into the hall,

1:07:35.917 --> 1:07:39.959
and when I came back, Marla
was in the kitchen alone

1:07:39.959 --> 1:07:42.000
eating the shortbread.

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.792
And she was the one who told
me about Laura and Brad,

1:07:44.792 --> 1:07:48.333
and she was the
one that invited me

1:07:48.333 --> 1:07:53.166
to do this last minute gig
after going out with Archie.

1:07:54.208 --> 1:07:55.834
Going, going out?

1:07:55.834 --> 1:07:56.625
On a date?

1:07:56.625 --> 1:07:58.000
I mean, I don't know.

1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.959
They were clearly
flirting at the luncheon.

1:07:59.959 --> 1:08:01.333
Wow.

1:08:01.333 --> 1:08:03.083
But the thing
is, is, I've just,

1:08:03.083 --> 1:08:04.625
I've known Marla for years.

1:08:04.625 --> 1:08:07.291
There's just no way
that she's a killer.

1:08:07.291 --> 1:08:08.458
In my experience,

1:08:11.375 --> 1:08:12.500
there's always a way

1:08:15.041 --> 1:08:16.291
for anyone of us.

1:08:17.750 --> 1:08:22.208
It's just a matter of things
coming together in a way

1:08:23.959 --> 1:08:25.375
that makes it happen.

1:08:48.500 --> 1:08:50.375
Take the appetizers
to the staging area.

1:08:50.375 --> 1:08:51.667
Thank you.

1:08:53.083 --> 1:08:54.166
So beautiful.

1:08:58.000 --> 1:08:59.166
Oh.

1:08:59.166 --> 1:09:01.125
You as friendly
with Adele Dennison?

1:09:01.125 --> 1:09:03.250
As friendly as I need to be.

1:09:11.250 --> 1:09:13.375
What about Julian Geddes?

1:09:13.375 --> 1:09:14.875
That's Adele's son.

1:09:14.875 --> 1:09:17.750
Well, I was his teacher
for a couple of years, but...

1:09:19.375 --> 1:09:21.000
And how is he doing now?

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.083
I'm sorry, but that
would be violating

1:09:23.083 --> 1:09:24.417
doctor-patient privileges.

1:09:57.959 --> 1:09:59.458
Mmm.

1:09:59.458 --> 1:10:00.583
Excuse me.

1:10:00.583 --> 1:10:01.709
I'll see you later.

1:10:01.709 --> 1:10:03.166
- Wow, Goldy.
- Yeah?

1:10:03.166 --> 1:10:04.417
We're only in the appetizers,

1:10:04.417 --> 1:10:06.834
and it's already magnificent.

1:10:06.834 --> 1:10:08.458
Thank you, I appreciate that.

1:10:08.458 --> 1:10:12.834
However, I have been
instructed by the hostess

1:10:12.834 --> 1:10:16.583
to ask you to shed
your outerwear.

1:10:19.125 --> 1:10:20.083
Okay.

1:10:20.083 --> 1:10:21.083
She's the boss.

1:10:23.208 --> 1:10:24.417
I'll go stow this.

1:10:24.417 --> 1:10:25.917
No, please, let me.

1:10:25.917 --> 1:10:27.083
I can take it for you.
- Really?

1:10:27.083 --> 1:10:28.500
I actually have
to use the restroom.

1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:31.000
Oh, thank you, thanks.

1:10:33.458 --> 1:10:35.417
Goldy, you look...

1:10:37.583 --> 1:10:38.500
Oh, my.

1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:40.500
You struck Richard dumb, Goldy.

1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:42.208
Is there anything you can't do?

1:10:42.208 --> 1:10:44.250
I don't know, I'm sure Richard
can think of a few things.

1:10:44.250 --> 1:10:46.959
Oh, yeah, you
two are hilarious.

1:10:48.417 --> 1:10:50.625
Owen, the O'Connors
would love to hear more

1:10:50.625 --> 1:10:51.792
about the wellness center.

1:10:51.792 --> 1:10:52.667
Can you?

1:10:52.667 --> 1:10:54.458
Uh, duty calls.

1:10:54.458 --> 1:10:56.041
Have fun.

1:11:14.875 --> 1:11:17.959
Oh!

1:11:20.458 --> 1:11:22.959
Don't scream.

1:11:22.959 --> 1:11:24.542
It's me.

1:11:24.542 --> 1:11:25.875
I didn't want to scare you.

1:11:27.583 --> 1:11:28.875
Well, you failed!

1:11:28.875 --> 1:11:29.709
I'm sorry!

1:11:31.166 --> 1:11:33.583
And first off, what are
you doing without gloves?

1:11:33.583 --> 1:11:35.542
Put these on, okay?

1:11:35.542 --> 1:11:36.625
You wanna be detective,
you've gotta get better

1:11:36.625 --> 1:11:37.583
at sneaking around.

1:11:39.917 --> 1:11:41.083
This is Adele's desk.

1:11:47.709 --> 1:11:48.500
Look.

1:11:51.083 --> 1:11:51.917
Clonazepam.

1:11:53.417 --> 1:11:54.834
Isn't that for seizures?

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:58.875
I worked with a
chef who had them.

1:11:58.875 --> 1:12:00.375
Well, there also for anxiety.

1:12:03.166 --> 1:12:04.917
Looks like he hasn't
taken them in months.

1:12:13.083 --> 1:12:15.542
"Stay away from
my husband or I will

1:12:15.542 --> 1:12:16.917
end things for you here."

1:12:20.834 --> 1:12:22.542
Maybe she was
talking about getting

1:12:22.542 --> 1:12:23.959
Laura fired from school?

1:12:27.375 --> 1:12:29.166
Yeah, maybe.

1:12:29.166 --> 1:12:31.583
Don't you wanna take that?

1:12:31.583 --> 1:12:34.458
Not until I come back
with a search warrant.

1:12:34.458 --> 1:12:35.792
Oh, yeah. Yes.

1:12:38.542 --> 1:12:40.875
I was, um, starting
to think that you

1:12:40.875 --> 1:12:42.458
weren't gonna make it.

1:12:45.125 --> 1:12:46.542
Needed to buy a fresh tie.

1:12:52.041 --> 1:12:52.875
You did good.

1:13:06.291 --> 1:13:07.125
Wow.

1:13:09.166 --> 1:13:10.583
You are good at what you do.

1:13:12.750 --> 1:13:13.750
So are you.

1:13:18.583 --> 1:13:21.792
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you.

1:13:22.667 --> 1:13:23.917
What are you doing here?

1:13:26.250 --> 1:13:27.333
In Elk Park, I mean.

1:13:29.458 --> 1:13:33.333
That's a, that's a
funny story, actually.

1:13:33.333 --> 1:13:34.959
My ex-wife is from here.

1:13:37.166 --> 1:13:38.000
Ex-wife.

1:13:38.792 --> 1:13:39.667
Yup.

1:13:42.625 --> 1:13:44.208
Hmm.

1:13:44.208 --> 1:13:46.166
Yeah, she was always talking
about how much she missed it,

1:13:46.166 --> 1:13:49.125
especially when we were
going through a rough patch,

1:13:49.125 --> 1:13:53.458
which was a good description
of all three years

1:13:53.458 --> 1:13:54.458
of our marriage.

1:13:56.083 --> 1:13:58.291
Oh.

1:13:58.291 --> 1:14:02.375
Anyway, I saw this job
listed and I thought,

1:14:02.375 --> 1:14:04.709
you know, maybe, maybe
that'll be the thing to

1:14:06.333 --> 1:14:08.125
save our marriage.

1:14:08.125 --> 1:14:10.500
She served me with
the divorce papers

1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:12.667
on the same day the
job offer came through.

1:14:16.125 --> 1:14:17.709
But you came anyway.

1:14:17.709 --> 1:14:19.875
Yeah, San Francisco
just wasn't the same.

1:14:22.458 --> 1:14:24.417
And I needed a break
from all the crime.

1:14:29.208 --> 1:14:31.000
What was her name?

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.333
Jessamine.

1:14:32.333 --> 1:14:33.166
Jessamine?

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000
Jessamine Cole?

1:14:36.667 --> 1:14:37.500
You know her?

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:38.709
Since kindergarten.

1:14:41.667 --> 1:14:45.500
I'm surprised you lasted
three years.

1:14:57.917 --> 1:15:01.125
Ladies and gentlemen, will
you please head this way?

1:15:01.125 --> 1:15:02.667
Dinner will be served shortly.

1:15:40.083 --> 1:15:40.959
Owen.

1:15:41.750 --> 1:15:43.250
Goldy.

1:15:43.250 --> 1:15:44.291
What are you doing?

1:15:47.625 --> 1:15:49.750
Hoping not to find something.

1:15:52.458 --> 1:15:54.000
I don't understand.

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.750
My patient Julian Geddes
lives here, and, uh.

1:15:56.750 --> 1:15:58.041
What?

1:15:58.041 --> 1:16:00.291
I'm afraid Julian has, uh,

1:16:00.291 --> 1:16:03.375
developed an unhealthy fixation.

1:16:03.375 --> 1:16:06.583
An obsessive attraction,
really, to, uh,

1:16:07.834 --> 1:16:09.083
a mutual friend of ours.

1:16:11.291 --> 1:16:12.125
To Laura?

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:15.291
She obviously didn't tell you,

1:16:15.291 --> 1:16:18.083
probably trying to
protect him, I'm sure.

1:16:18.083 --> 1:16:20.917
But my concern was that
he might've somehow...

1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:24.542
Do you know that Julian's
father was killed

1:16:24.542 --> 1:16:26.500
the same way,
driving off a cliff?

1:16:28.083 --> 1:16:30.542
I did, actually.

1:16:30.542 --> 1:16:32.041
I was praying that...

1:16:40.291 --> 1:16:41.458
That's water hemlock.

1:16:44.834 --> 1:16:46.041
The police said it
was in the shortbread

1:16:46.041 --> 1:16:48.041
that Laura ate before she died.

1:16:48.041 --> 1:16:49.583
Your shortbread?

1:16:49.583 --> 1:16:51.709
Same recipe, minus the poison.

1:16:55.208 --> 1:16:59.291
I posted the menu online a
week before the luncheon.

1:16:59.291 --> 1:17:01.875
Goldy, Julian was in
the parking lot with Laura

1:17:01.875 --> 1:17:03.291
that day before she left.

1:17:03.291 --> 1:17:06.250
Do you think-
- What I think

1:17:06.250 --> 1:17:09.333
is that the person who planted
the hemlock in the drawer

1:17:12.333 --> 1:17:16.083
should've gone to the trouble
to look in Julian's kitchen.

1:17:16.083 --> 1:17:19.166
Do you know if this oven works?

1:17:19.166 --> 1:17:21.041
Yeah, we'd get it fixed
if the current tenant

1:17:21.041 --> 1:17:22.166
ever did any cooking.

1:17:25.709 --> 1:17:27.417
Julian couldn't
bake shortbread,

1:17:29.583 --> 1:17:32.250
but I bet your oven
works just fine.

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:34.834
Hang on.

1:17:34.834 --> 1:17:36.917
You, you think that I-

1:17:36.917 --> 1:17:39.667
Planted the hemlock in the
drawer before I walked in.

1:17:40.917 --> 1:17:41.834
Yeah, I do.

1:17:44.917 --> 1:17:47.000
But I'm not a detective, so.

1:17:49.583 --> 1:17:50.542
Maybe I'm wrong.

1:17:53.417 --> 1:17:55.041
I'm just gonna run it
by Detective Shultz.

1:17:55.041 --> 1:17:55.875
Wait.

1:17:57.709 --> 1:17:58.875
Goldy!
- What?

1:17:58.875 --> 1:18:03.875
Owen!

1:18:16.208 --> 1:18:17.500
You at the station?

1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:18.875
No, we're coming to you.

1:18:18.875 --> 1:18:20.291
Mason, we're
about to have dinner.

1:18:20.291 --> 1:18:22.667
We're watching Julian's
surveillance camera.

1:18:22.667 --> 1:18:24.458
Goldy's in trouble!

1:18:26.834 --> 1:18:28.458
He's taking her into the forest.

1:18:30.041 --> 1:18:31.792
Go on, deeper into
the woods, hurry.

1:18:31.792 --> 1:18:33.083
- Okay, just-
- Come on.

1:18:33.083 --> 1:18:34.250
Just let me take
my heels off, okay?

1:18:34.250 --> 1:18:36.417
- Come on.
- I can't walk in them.

1:18:48.625 --> 1:18:49.500
Goldy!

1:19:02.417 --> 1:19:04.000
Goldy!

1:19:16.166 --> 1:19:17.041
Goldy!

1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:31.333
Goldy!

1:19:35.792 --> 1:19:37.041
Goldy!

1:19:41.834 --> 1:19:42.959
Hey.

1:19:42.959 --> 1:19:44.166
Your head! Are you okay?

1:19:44.166 --> 1:19:45.125
Yeah.

1:19:45.125 --> 1:19:46.375
It's Owen.

1:19:46.375 --> 1:19:48.291
He killed Laura and he's
trying to frame Julian.

1:19:50.875 --> 1:19:53.458
Owen, put the gun down.

1:19:54.875 --> 1:19:57.417
Owen, Owen, look
at me, look at me.

1:19:57.417 --> 1:19:58.250
You knew.

1:19:59.250 --> 1:20:00.667
- Hey, Laura.
- Hi.

1:20:00.667 --> 1:20:02.667
Uh, here. For you.

1:20:02.667 --> 1:20:03.583
What is this?

1:20:03.583 --> 1:20:04.667
I don't know.

1:20:04.667 --> 1:20:06.083
Goldy just...

1:20:06.083 --> 1:20:07.333
You knew if she
started eating right away

1:20:07.333 --> 1:20:08.166
that the hemlock
would hit as she was

1:20:08.166 --> 1:20:09.250
driving up the mountain.

1:20:10.500 --> 1:20:12.000
And you stayed on
the phone with her

1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:14.208
just to make sure that
your plan would work.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.250
You should've stayed
out of it, Goldy.

1:20:18.250 --> 1:20:19.458
Stayed out of what?

1:20:19.458 --> 1:20:20.291
I'm trying to help people!

1:20:20.291 --> 1:20:21.834
You killed Laura!

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.166
No, you don't under,
you don't understand.

1:20:25.166 --> 1:20:26.750
Don't you see?

1:20:26.750 --> 1:20:29.208
The wellness center can help
treat people with addiction.

1:20:29.208 --> 1:20:31.375
Oh, I use it all the
time in my hypnotherapy

1:20:31.375 --> 1:20:33.125
to treat serious addiction.

1:20:33.125 --> 1:20:35.917
Modify behavior, help people
break through limitations

1:20:35.917 --> 1:20:37.250
in their thinking.

1:20:37.250 --> 1:20:39.041
The power of suggestion.

1:20:39.041 --> 1:20:43.000
What if Julian was
the inspiration to build

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:44.375
a wellness center?

1:20:44.375 --> 1:20:46.125
His troubles gave
me the inspiration

1:20:46.125 --> 1:20:47.583
to build the wellness center.

1:20:49.542 --> 1:20:51.667
And what about Julian?

1:20:51.667 --> 1:20:53.208
You were supposed to help him.

1:20:53.208 --> 1:20:56.250
Julian, tell your mother
that the wellness center

1:20:56.250 --> 1:20:59.959
is a wonderful investment,
and to give Archie the money.

1:20:59.959 --> 1:21:01.083
Yeah, but
then Julian realized

1:21:01.083 --> 1:21:02.583
what he was trying to do.

1:21:02.583 --> 1:21:04.125
Because he stopped
taking his medications.

1:21:04.125 --> 1:21:06.083
You both think you're
so clever, don't you?

1:21:06.083 --> 1:21:08.959
It wasn't Archie who Laura
was gonna see that night.

1:21:08.959 --> 1:21:12.458
It was Julian, and he
told her what you did.

1:21:14.125 --> 1:21:16.417
And Laura made a complaint
to the state medical board.

1:21:16.417 --> 1:21:18.125
How did you know that?

1:21:18.125 --> 1:21:20.083
You know, the state of
Colorado has strict laws

1:21:20.083 --> 1:21:22.458
against the misuse
of hypnotherapy?

1:21:22.458 --> 1:21:24.083
You're probably gonna
lose your license.

1:21:24.083 --> 1:21:24.917
Answer me!

1:21:24.917 --> 1:21:26.000
How did you know that?

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.333
So what's your next move?

1:21:28.959 --> 1:21:30.166
You gonna shoot us both?

1:21:31.291 --> 1:21:32.250
Put it on Julian?

1:21:33.458 --> 1:21:35.542
The thing you don't
know is that Julian has

1:21:35.542 --> 1:21:37.583
an alibi right now.

1:21:37.583 --> 1:21:39.959
For the past hour, he's
been with Deputy Kildea.

1:21:39.959 --> 1:21:40.834
No.

1:21:42.041 --> 1:21:45.000
No, you're, you're bluffing.

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.333
Just like you bluffed Julian

1:21:47.333 --> 1:21:49.667
when you sent him that email
from Laura's work computer.

1:21:49.667 --> 1:21:52.750
You needed people to see
Julian in the school parking lot

1:21:52.750 --> 1:21:56.959
with Laura before she
died because all you did

1:21:56.959 --> 1:21:58.500
was tip Laura off.

1:21:58.500 --> 1:22:01.083
As soon as Julian told her
that she sent him an email,

1:22:01.083 --> 1:22:03.041
Laura suspected that
he was in danger

1:22:03.041 --> 1:22:05.208
and she sent him somewhere safe.

1:22:05.208 --> 1:22:07.625
Julian's got a lot to
share with Deputy Kildea.

1:22:08.750 --> 1:22:11.291
With the thumb drive
Laura gave him,

1:22:11.291 --> 1:22:12.959
with the medical
board complaint,

1:22:14.291 --> 1:22:16.959
and the fact that two
weeks ago Julian installed

1:22:16.959 --> 1:22:19.709
hidden security cameras
in the guest quarters.

1:22:19.709 --> 1:22:22.291
That's how you knew
we were in the woods.

1:22:25.041 --> 1:22:27.291
You're lying. You're lying!

1:22:27.291 --> 1:22:29.166
Owen had to plant
the poison tonight

1:22:29.166 --> 1:22:30.542
so that by the time
the medical examiner

1:22:30.542 --> 1:22:31.750
got back from her conference,

1:22:31.750 --> 1:22:33.542
I'd have reason to
search Julian's room.

1:22:33.542 --> 1:22:35.542
But Owen, I had the ME
come back a day early,

1:22:35.542 --> 1:22:38.208
so we're a few
steps ahead of you.

1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:41.667
- It's over.
- Don't!

1:22:41.667 --> 1:22:42.792
Hey, hey!

1:22:42.792 --> 1:22:43.667
Owen.

1:22:43.667 --> 1:22:44.625
Don't.

1:22:44.625 --> 1:22:47.500
Don't get any closer, Goldy.

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.834
Owen, look.

1:22:51.834 --> 1:22:56.417
I know, I know that you
just wanna help people,

1:22:56.417 --> 1:22:59.709
and the wellness center,
it is such a great cause.

1:23:01.542 --> 1:23:02.375
But Owen,

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:07.000
your mother, she, she
wouldn't want this.

1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:09.500
Did you know that his
mother was an addict?

1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.000
I could've helped
so many people.

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.083
I know.

1:23:16.083 --> 1:23:17.166
Detective! Goldy!

1:23:23.208 --> 1:23:24.083
Hey.

1:23:25.041 --> 1:23:25.875
Hey.

1:23:27.709 --> 1:23:28.583
Take him away.

1:23:36.041 --> 1:23:38.458
You have the
right to remain silent.

1:23:38.458 --> 1:23:40.959
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1:23:40.959 --> 1:23:41.917
in the court of law.

1:23:41.917 --> 1:23:44.375
I was closer.

1:23:50.208 --> 1:23:51.208
You're good.

1:23:51.208 --> 1:23:52.041
Yeah.

1:23:55.417 --> 1:23:57.875
Hey, doin' all right?

1:24:08.750 --> 1:24:10.959
So you, like, you
like disarmed him?

1:24:12.250 --> 1:24:13.083
Well.

1:24:13.917 --> 1:24:14.792
I tackled him.

1:24:16.166 --> 1:24:17.917
You're like the
coolest person I know,

1:24:17.917 --> 1:24:21.583
and that even includes
Detective Shultz.

1:24:23.458 --> 1:24:24.291
Mason.

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:32.000
I'm gonna head
to the station now.

1:24:36.667 --> 1:24:38.542
Well, I hate to be uncool,

1:24:38.542 --> 1:24:40.667
but I gotta head there as well.

1:24:42.125 --> 1:24:44.250
Got a long night of
paperwork ahead of me.

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:47.917
I'm gonna need you to come
to the station tomorrow.

1:24:47.917 --> 1:24:49.542
Is that okay?

1:24:49.542 --> 1:24:50.375
Of course.

1:24:50.375 --> 1:24:51.208
9:00am?

1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:58.959
Try to get some sleep
tonight, all right?

1:25:03.208 --> 1:25:04.041
Thank you.

1:25:07.125 --> 1:25:08.291
I'm just doing my job.

1:25:09.792 --> 1:25:10.625
Well,

1:25:12.750 --> 1:25:16.208
thank you for doing it so well.
