KATARA: <i>Water...</i>

00:04.880 --> 00:06.090
<i>Earth...</i>

00:06.670 --> 00:08.340
<i>Fire...</i>

00:08.890 --> 00:10.300
<i>Air.</i>

00:11.350 --> 00:15.020
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:18.600
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.480 --> 00:22.570
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

00:22.650 --> 00:23.780
<i>could stop them.</i>

00:23.860 --> 00:25.570
<i>But when the world
needed him most,</i>

00:25.650 --> 00:26.820
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:28.400
<i>100 years passed,</i>

00:28.490 --> 00:31.120
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar―</i>

00:31.200 --> 00:32.780
<i>An airbender named Aang.</i>

00:32.950 --> 00:35.080
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great,</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:37.870
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:38.960
AANG: Oof.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.170
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

00:50.470 --> 00:53.850
Even though I was born blind,
I've never had a problem seeing.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.640
I see with earthbending.

00:56.220 --> 00:57.730
Look here, sugar queen,

00:57.810 --> 00:59.390
I gave up everything I had

00:59.480 --> 01:01.600
so that I could
teach Aang earthbending.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.740
Well, look at this.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.530
Enemies and traitors
all working together.

01:14.370 --> 01:15.410
Aah!

01:30.590 --> 01:32.050
Today's the day.

01:32.140 --> 01:33.260
Can you believe it?

01:33.340 --> 01:35.510
After all that time
searching for a teacher,

01:35.600 --> 01:37.890
I'm finally
starting earthbending.

01:38.020 --> 01:39.640
And this place,
it's perfect.

01:39.770 --> 01:41.100
Don't you think?

01:41.480 --> 01:42.480
Sokka?

01:43.270 --> 01:44.270
( GROWLS )

01:44.360 --> 01:45.860
Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?

01:48.530 --> 01:49.610
( WHISPERS ) Sorry.

01:51.950 --> 01:54.780
Good morning, earthbending student.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.330
Good morning, Sifu Toph.

01:57.540 --> 02:00.460
Hey, you never call me
Sifu Katara.

02:00.540 --> 02:02.540
Well, if you think I should.

02:02.620 --> 02:03.630
( SOKKA GROWLS )

02:04.250 --> 02:05.380
Sorry, snoozles.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.380
We'll do our earthbending
as quietly as we can.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.260
Aah!

02:14.590 --> 02:15.930
( GRUMBLING EXCITEDLY )

02:17.060 --> 02:18.890
Running around
and making noises

02:18.970 --> 02:21.140
and Sokka's trying to sleep.

02:22.060 --> 02:24.020
So what move are you gonna
teach me first?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.400
Rockalanche, the trembler?

02:26.610 --> 02:29.610
Oh, maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool
out of land.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.240
Well, let's start with, move a rock.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.280
Sounds good. Sounds good.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.580
The key to earthbending
is your stance.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.120
You've got to be
steady and strong.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.040
Rock is a stubborn element.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.500
If you're going to move it,

02:45.580 --> 02:47.840
you've got to be like a rock yourself.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.500
Like a rock. Got it.

02:49.590 --> 02:50.590
Good.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.300
Now, the actual motion of
this one is pretty simple.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.010
Ok, you ready to give it a try?

03:00.430 --> 03:01.430
I'm ready.

03:03.390 --> 03:05.940
Aah! Uh!

03:06.400 --> 03:07.730
SOKKA: Rock beats airbender.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.360
Ha ha! I got you, dad.

03:15.150 --> 03:17.490
No! Ha ha.

03:17.570 --> 03:18.990
( LAUGHTER )

03:23.370 --> 03:25.580
My beloved Lu Ten,

03:26.040 --> 03:27.540
I will see you again.

03:29.750 --> 03:30.750
ZUKO: <i>Uncle.</i>

03:31.460 --> 03:32.960
You were unconscious.

03:33.970 --> 03:35.130
Azula did this to you.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.590
It was a surprise attack.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.640
Somehow that's not so surprising.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.560
I hope I made it
the way you like it.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.770
( DEADPAN ) Good.

03:50.860 --> 03:51.860
( GAGS )

03:51.940 --> 03:55.740
That was very, um, bracing.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.160
So, uncle, I've been thinking.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.620
It's only a matter of time

04:01.700 --> 04:03.160
before I run into Azula again.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.750
I'm going to need to know more
advanced firebending

04:05.830 --> 04:07.710
if I want to stand a chance
against her.

04:07.790 --> 04:08.920
I know what you'll say.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.750
She's my sister. I should be
trying to get along with her.

04:11.840 --> 04:15.670
No. She's crazy,
and she needs to go down.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.350
It's time to resume your training.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.600
I don't understand
what went wrong.

04:27.690 --> 04:29.440
He did it exactly the way you did.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.770
Maybe there's another way.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.730
What if I came at the boulder
from a different angle?

04:33.820 --> 04:35.190
No, that's the problem.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.450
You've got to stop thinking
like an airbender.

04:37.780 --> 04:40.070
There's no different angle,
no clever solution,

04:40.160 --> 04:42.700
no trickity-trick
that's gonna move that rock.

04:42.990 --> 04:45.080
You've got
to face it head-on.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.460
And when I say head-on,
I mean like this.

04:48.790 --> 04:49.790
Hyah!

04:50.540 --> 04:51.540
Whoa.

04:54.050 --> 04:56.420
I've been training Aang
for a while now.

04:56.510 --> 04:59.590
He really responds well to a positive
teaching experience―

04:59.970 --> 05:01.840
Lots of encouragement
and praise,

05:02.180 --> 05:04.510
Kind words. If he's
doing something wrong,

05:04.600 --> 05:07.600
maybe a gentle nudge
in the right direction.

05:07.930 --> 05:11.600
Thanks, Katara.
A gentle nudge. I'll try that.

05:12.190 --> 05:14.480
Keep your knees high,
twinkle toes.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.960
Rock collide.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.490
Huh?

06:21.590 --> 06:22.800
Rock collide.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.110
You're awfully cute,

06:36.310 --> 06:39.150
But unfortunately for you,
you're made of meat.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.450
Just a bit closer.

06:42.530 --> 06:45.360
( YELLING )

06:50.200 --> 06:51.250
Gotcha.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.290
You are one lucky
little meat creature.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.050
Lightning is
a pure expression of firebending―

07:04.130 --> 07:05.510
Without aggression.

07:05.590 --> 07:08.050
It is not fueled by rage or emotion

07:08.140 --> 07:09.640
the way other firebending is.

07:10.390 --> 07:13.060
Some call lightning
the cold-blooded fire.

07:13.810 --> 07:16.730
It is precise and deadly, like Azula.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.230
To perform the technique requires

07:19.320 --> 07:20.690
peace of mind.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.860
I see. That's why we're drinking tea―

07:24.650 --> 07:25.950
To calm the mind.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.620
Oh, yeah, good point!

07:28.240 --> 07:29.700
( SLOWLY ) I mean, yes.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.370
There is energy all around us.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.920
The energy is both Yin and Yang―

07:36.250 --> 07:39.170
A positive energy and a negative energy.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.880
Only a select few firebenders
can separate these energies.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.550
This creates an imbalance.

07:45.630 --> 07:48.340
The energy wants to restore balance.

07:48.430 --> 07:51.470
And in the moment
the positive and negative energy

07:51.560 --> 07:53.470
come crashing back together,

07:53.560 --> 07:56.560
You provide release and guidance,

07:56.640 --> 07:58.230
creating lightning.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.290
I'm ready to try it.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.910
Remember, once you separate the energy,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.540
you do not command it.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.670
You are simply its humble guide.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.250
Breathe first.

08:22.630 --> 08:24.010
( INHALES )

08:30.640 --> 08:32.560
Hyah! Uh!

08:37.890 --> 08:40.980
TOPH: This time, we're going to
try something a little different.

08:41.060 --> 08:44.440
Instead of moving a rock,
we're going to stop a rock.

08:44.780 --> 08:46.320
Get in your horse stance.

08:47.990 --> 08:50.200
I'm going to roll that boulder
down at you.

08:50.610 --> 08:52.620
If you have the attitude
of an earthbender,

08:53.080 --> 08:56.000
you'll stay in your stance
and stop the rock,

08:56.620 --> 08:58.080
Like this.

08:58.460 --> 09:00.040
Sorry, Toph, but are you sure

09:00.120 --> 09:02.790
this is really the best way
to teach Aang earthbending?

09:03.170 --> 09:04.800
I'm glad you said something.

09:05.130 --> 09:06.840
Actually, there is a better way.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.430
This way, you'll really have to sense

09:09.510 --> 09:11.640
the vibrations
of the boulder to stop it.

09:12.180 --> 09:13.430
Thank you, Katara.

09:13.510 --> 09:15.260
( SARCASTICALLY )
Yeah, thanks, Katara.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.560
( CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY )

09:44.340 --> 09:45.920
I guess I just panicked.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.340
I don't know what to say.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.170
There's nothing to say.
You blew it.

09:50.260 --> 09:53.010
You had a perfect stance
and perfect form,

09:53.090 --> 09:54.720
but when it came right down to it,

09:54.800 --> 09:56.350
you didn't have the guts.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.770
I know. I'm sorry.

09:59.350 --> 10:00.680
Yeah, you are sorry.

10:00.890 --> 10:02.980
If you're not tough enough
to stop the rock,

10:03.060 --> 10:05.820
then you can at least
give it the pleasure of smushing you

10:05.900 --> 10:08.650
instead ofjumping out
of the way like a jelly-boned wimp.

10:09.070 --> 10:13.660
Now do you have what it takes
to face that rock like an earthbender?

10:14.870 --> 10:17.540
No, I don't think I do.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.200
Aang, it's no big deal.

10:19.290 --> 10:22.370
You'll take a break and try
earthbending again when you're ready.

10:22.460 --> 10:25.330
Besides, you still have
a lot of waterbending to work on, ok?

10:25.880 --> 10:27.840
Yeah, that sounds good.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.550
Yeah, whatever.
Go splash around until you feel better.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.600
Why can't I do it?

10:38.680 --> 10:41.140
Instead of lightning,
it keeps exploding in my face,

10:41.390 --> 10:43.020
like everything always does.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.730
I was afraid this might happen.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.520
You will not be able
to master lightning

10:48.610 --> 10:51.490
until you have dealt
with the turmoil inside you.

10:51.990 --> 10:53.110
What turmoil?

10:53.360 --> 10:56.570
Zuko, you must let go
of your feelings of shame

10:56.660 --> 10:58.740
if you want your anger to go away.

10:59.030 --> 11:00.740
But I don't feel any shame at all.

11:00.830 --> 11:02.000
I'm as proud as ever.

11:02.330 --> 11:05.540
Prince Zuko, pride is not
the opposite of shame,

11:05.620 --> 11:06.630
but its source.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.170
True humility is the only antidote
to shame.

11:10.250 --> 11:14.010
Well, my life has been nothing
but humbling lately.

11:15.430 --> 11:17.300
I have another idea.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.640
I will teach you
a firebending move

11:19.720 --> 11:21.430
that even Azula doesn't know,

11:21.680 --> 11:23.930
because I made it up myself.

11:28.610 --> 11:30.730
You probably think
I deserve this, don't you?

11:33.530 --> 11:34.950
Look, I'm sorry I hunted you,

11:35.030 --> 11:37.110
but that's just the natural
order of things.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.120
Big things eat smaller things.
Nothing personal.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.200
But this time,
it didn't work out that way.

11:42.540 --> 11:43.580
( CALLS )

11:44.210 --> 11:46.920
I admit it, you're cute.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.630
Ok, you convinced me.

11:51.050 --> 11:52.340
If I get out of this alive,

11:52.420 --> 11:55.510
it's a karmically correct
vegetarian existence for me.

11:55.720 --> 12:00.350
No meat, even though meat
is so tasty.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.900
Hey, it looks like my karma's
already paying off.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.820
That's ok. I got it.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.910
Now come back, boomerang.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.620
( CROAKING )

12:31.840 --> 12:34.760
You know this block you're having
is only temporary, right?

12:35.090 --> 12:36.550
I don't want to talk about it.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.130
You do realize
that's the problem, don't you?

12:39.550 --> 12:41.800
If you face this issue
instead of avoiding it...

12:41.890 --> 12:43.470
I know, I know, I know, I know.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.640
I get it, all right?
I need to face it head-on like a rock.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.440
But I just can't do it.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.350
I don't know why I can't, but I can't.

12:50.810 --> 12:53.190
Aang, if fire and water are opposites,

12:53.270 --> 12:55.070
Then what's the opposite of air?

12:55.320 --> 12:56.440
I guess it's earth.

12:56.690 --> 12:58.780
That's why it's so hard
for you to get this.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.280
You're working
with your natural opposite.

13:01.370 --> 13:02.570
But you'll figure it out.

13:02.660 --> 13:03.870
I know you will.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.660
Think fast.

13:10.620 --> 13:14.710
Excellent. You have the reflexes
of a waterbending master.

13:14.840 --> 13:18.510
Thanks, Katara, Sifu Katara.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.680
Fire is the element of power.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.680
The people of the Fire Nation
have desire and will

13:27.980 --> 13:30.390
and the energy and drive
to achieve what they want.

13:32.150 --> 13:34.770
Earth is the element of substance.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.570
The people of the Earth Kingdom

13:36.650 --> 13:38.240
are diverse and strong.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.900
They are persistent and enduring.

13:42.110 --> 13:44.490
Air is the element of freedom.

13:44.580 --> 13:47.240
The Air Nomads detached themselves

13:47.330 --> 13:49.330
from worldly concerns

13:49.620 --> 13:51.540
and found peace and freedom.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.540
Also, they apparently had

13:53.630 --> 13:55.920
pretty good senses of humor.

13:59.420 --> 14:02.180
Water is the element of change.

14:02.260 --> 14:04.050
The people of the Water Tribe

14:04.140 --> 14:07.220
are capable of adapting to many things.

14:07.640 --> 14:11.140
They have a deep sense
of community and love

14:11.350 --> 14:13.520
that holds them together
through anything.

14:14.860 --> 14:16.730
Why are you telling me these things?

14:17.320 --> 14:20.780
It is important to draw wisdom
from many different places.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.660
If we take it from only one place,

14:23.740 --> 14:26.120
it becomes rigid and stale.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.910
Understanding others―
The other elements

14:29.240 --> 14:30.950
and the other nations―

14:31.040 --> 14:32.920
will help you become whole.

14:33.670 --> 14:37.090
All this four elements talk
is sounding like Avatar stuff.

14:37.420 --> 14:40.670
It is the combination
of the four elements in one person

14:40.760 --> 14:43.300
that makes the Avatar so powerful,

14:43.630 --> 14:46.350
but it can make you more powerful, too.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.010
You see, the technique
I am about to teach you

14:49.100 --> 14:51.680
is one I learned
by studying the waterbenders.

15:00.860 --> 15:01.940
Aang...

15:02.030 --> 15:03.530
I found these nuts in your bag.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.160
I figured you wouldn't mind.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.030
And besides, even if you did,

15:07.120 --> 15:09.740
you're too much of a pushover
to do anything about it.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.330
As a matter of fact,
I don't mind.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.040
I'm happy to share
anything I have.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.920
You know, I'm really
glad you feel that way,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.130
Because I also have
this great new nutcracker.

15:23.670 --> 15:25.840
- Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't―
-( SMASH )

15:26.180 --> 15:28.350
That's an antique,
handcrafted by the monk―

15:29.140 --> 15:30.560
It's a delicate instrument.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.600
It's not the only
delicate instrument around here.

15:39.190 --> 15:41.570
Om.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.320
Hey, Aang, have you seen―

15:43.400 --> 15:44.450
Meditating here.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.490
It's important. It's almost sundown,

15:46.570 --> 15:48.320
and Sokka isn't back yet.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.990
I think we should search for him.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.240
We'll find him faster if we split up.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.670
Ok, karma person or thing,

15:56.750 --> 15:58.420
whoever's in charge of this stuff,

15:58.500 --> 16:01.090
if I can just
get out of this situation alive,

16:01.170 --> 16:05.420
I will give up meat and sarcasm, ok?

16:05.510 --> 16:08.220
Ow! That's all I got.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.430
That's pretty much my whole identity.

16:10.510 --> 16:13.060
Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.730
But I'm willing to be Sokka,

16:14.810 --> 16:16.600
the veggies and straight-talk fellow.

16:16.850 --> 16:17.850
Deal?

16:18.730 --> 16:19.730
Aang!

16:19.810 --> 16:21.820
Thank goodness.
Have you got any meat?

16:22.320 --> 16:24.190
Sokka, are you ok?

16:25.490 --> 16:28.280
Stop, stop!
You're gonna pull my fingers off.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.450
And I don't think
the rest of me is coming.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.870
Hmm, I bet I can airbend
you out of here.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.420
Seriously, Aang, I know you're new at it,

16:42.500 --> 16:45.170
but I could use a little
earthbending here. How about it?

16:46.510 --> 16:47.510
I can't.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.720
I can't do it.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.600
Well, if you can't earthbend me
out of here, go get Toph.

16:58.730 --> 16:59.980
I can't do that either.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.020
You can't? Why not?

17:02.440 --> 17:05.900
It would just be really... Uncomfortable.

17:06.110 --> 17:07.110
"Uncomfortable."

17:07.190 --> 17:09.530
Well, I wouldn't want you
to feel uncomfortable.

17:09.610 --> 17:10.780
Thanks, Sokka.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.280
This whole earthbending thing
really has me confused.

17:14.370 --> 17:15.990
There's so much pressure.

17:16.330 --> 17:18.330
Everyone expects me
to get it right away.

17:18.460 --> 17:21.040
It puts me in a really awkward position.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.380
Awkward position?
I think I know the feeling.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.380
If I try, I fail.

17:25.460 --> 17:28.590
But if I don't try,
I'm never gonna get it.

17:28.670 --> 17:31.260
I feel like I'm caught between
a rock and a hard place.

17:31.390 --> 17:33.050
Hmm, how about that?

17:33.760 --> 17:35.930
Aang, this is my friend,
Fufu Cuddly Poops.

17:36.010 --> 17:37.850
Fufu Cuddly Poops, Aang.

17:37.930 --> 17:41.520
Aw. What a cute name for a little baby
sabertooth moose lion cub.

17:41.980 --> 17:44.820
Really? He looks nothing like
a sabertooth moose lion.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.820
It's hard to tell before
their giant teeth and horns grow in.

17:48.070 --> 17:49.820
What you doing out here, little guy?

17:49.950 --> 17:51.110
Did you lose your mama?

17:52.490 --> 17:53.570
( ANIMAL GROWLING )

17:59.870 --> 18:02.500
Waterbenders deal
with the flow of energy.

18:03.130 --> 18:06.420
A waterbender lets their defense
become their offense,

18:06.500 --> 18:09.550
turning their opponent's
energy against them.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.130
I learned a way to do this with lightning.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.220
You can teach me to redirect lightning?

18:15.300 --> 18:18.350
If you let the energy
in your own body flow,

18:18.470 --> 18:20.100
The lightning will follow it.

18:20.180 --> 18:22.980
You must create a pathway
from your fingertips

18:23.060 --> 18:25.650
up your arm to your shoulder,

18:25.730 --> 18:27.730
then down into your stomach.

18:28.230 --> 18:31.070
The stomach is the source
of energy in your body.

18:31.530 --> 18:33.780
It is called the sea of chi,

18:34.740 --> 18:38.080
only in my case,
it is more like a vast ocean.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.950
( LAUGHING )

18:41.660 --> 18:46.710
From the stomach, you direct it
up again and out the other arm.

18:46.790 --> 18:48.800
The stomach detour is critical.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.720
You must not let the lightning
pass through your heart,

18:52.800 --> 18:54.970
for the damage could be deadly.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.850
You may wish to try
a physical motion

18:58.930 --> 19:03.020
to get a feel for the pathway's flow,
like this.

19:07.270 --> 19:09.900
Now, are you focusing your energy?

19:10.230 --> 19:13.450
Can you feel your own chi flowing in,

19:13.530 --> 19:16.490
down, up, and out?

19:16.570 --> 19:17.870
I think so.

19:19.580 --> 19:23.580
Come on. You got to feel the flow.

19:29.290 --> 19:31.510
Excellent. You've got it.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.090
Great. I'm ready
to try it with real lightning.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.470
What? Are you crazy?
Lightning is very dangerous.

19:38.550 --> 19:40.010
I thought that was the point―

19:40.100 --> 19:42.270
You teaching me how
to protect myself from it.

19:42.350 --> 19:45.440
Yeah, but I'm not going to shoot
lightning at you.

19:45.810 --> 19:46.810
If you're lucky,

19:46.900 --> 19:50.150
you will never have to use this
technique at all.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.150
( THUNDER )

19:54.240 --> 19:56.910
Well, if you won't help me,
I'll find my own lightning.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.410
Hey there.

20:02.990 --> 20:04.250

See? We have no problem with you.

20:13.550 --> 20:14.590
We're friendly.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.640
Aang, this is bad.
You got to get me out of here.

20:19.550 --> 20:20.550
Aah!

20:30.810 --> 20:32.020
This is really bad.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.530
Please, Aang!
You have to earthbend me out.

20:34.610 --> 20:35.990
There's no other way.

20:37.070 --> 20:40.820
Hyah! Hyah!

20:44.580 --> 20:45.580
Oh, no.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.210
Yoo-hoo! Look at me!

20:58.470 --> 21:00.010
Please. Don't leave me again.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.090
I won't.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.320
What are you doing here?

21:20.660 --> 21:21.990
Just enjoying the show.

21:22.070 --> 21:24.490
What? You were there the whole time?

21:24.580 --> 21:25.830
Pretty much.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.290
Why didn't you do something?

21:27.580 --> 21:28.790
Sokka was in trouble.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.120
I was in trouble!

21:30.210 --> 21:32.710
You could have gotten him out
and helped us get away.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.460
I guess it just didn't occur to me.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.590
Enough. I want my staff back.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.720
Do it now.

21:44.890 --> 21:45.890
What?

21:45.970 --> 21:47.430
Earthbend, twinkle toes.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.600
You just stood your ground
against a crazy beast.

21:50.690 --> 21:51.940
And even more impressive,

21:52.020 --> 21:53.810
you stood your ground against me.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.320
You've got the stuff.

21:55.610 --> 21:57.280
- But―
- Do it!

21:58.740 --> 21:59.820
Hyah!

22:00.650 --> 22:01.780
You did it!

22:02.360 --> 22:04.120
You're an earthbender.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.490
I can't believe it.

22:05.580 --> 22:08.950
Aw. This is really a wonderful,
touching moment.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.660
So could you get me out of here

22:10.750 --> 22:13.120
so I can give you both a big snuggly hug?

22:13.540 --> 22:14.790
No problem, Sokka.

22:15.170 --> 22:17.670
Actually, you should probably
let me do that.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.510
You're still a little new to this.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.380
You might accidentally crush him.

22:21.630 --> 22:23.050
Yeah, no crushing, please.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.310
You found him!

22:33.020 --> 22:34.940
The whole time I was in that hole,

22:35.020 --> 22:37.610
not knowing if I would live or die,

22:37.690 --> 22:40.400
it makes a man think
about what's really important.

22:40.490 --> 22:41.650
I realized―

22:41.740 --> 22:43.410
Hey, Katara, look what I can do.

22:46.830 --> 22:48.740
You did it!
I knew you would.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.540
You tried the positive reinforcement,
didn't you?

22:52.080 --> 22:54.370
Yup. It worked wonders.

completely rooted―
