- Hey, dudes.
- Hey, what's up?

00:47.206 --> 00:48.413
Just wondering
if you guys have seen me

00:48.413 --> 00:50.034
and Tolkien's
latest Tiktok?

00:50.034 --> 00:51.931
You guys made
another TikTok?

00:51.931 --> 00:53.724
I think it's really
our best one yet!

00:53.724 --> 00:56.206
Yeah, nobody really gives a shit
about your TikToks, guys.

00:56.206 --> 00:58.862
Hey, really great TikTok,
- guys!
- Oh! Thanks!

00:58.862 --> 01:01.551
Yeah, it was
- pretty amazing.
- Awesome!

01:01.551 --> 01:03.482
Well, anyway you guys
gotta check it out
when you get a chance!

01:03.482 --> 01:05.482
See ya later!
Yeah, see you guys!

01:08.448 --> 01:10.586
Hey fellas!
Loved that last TikTok!

01:10.586 --> 01:11.620
Thanks, Butters!

01:17.413 --> 01:19.517
<i>Konnichiwa!</i>

01:19.517 --> 01:21.896
<i>Sayonara!</i>

01:21.896 --> 01:24.137
<i>Kochi, kochi, kochi!</i>

01:24.137 --> 01:27.551
<i>Sayonara!</i>

01:27.551 --> 01:29.758
<i>Konnichiwa!</i>

01:29.758 --> 01:31.862
<i>Sayonara--</i>

01:31.862 --> 01:34.310
What the fuck is this?

01:34.310 --> 01:36.379
Seriously,
what the fuck is this?

01:36.379 --> 01:37.793
Have you guys noticed
that Kyle and Tolkien

01:37.793 --> 01:40.413
are, like, doing everything
together lately?

01:40.413 --> 01:42.310
Yeah, they're quite
the little team, aren't they?

01:47.724 --> 01:49.758
I, uh...
I'm gonna inside, guys.

01:49.758 --> 01:51.000
I'm gonna get
some homework done.

01:52.896 --> 01:56.275
Wow. I feel really bad
for Stan.

01:56.275 --> 01:57.965
It's gotta be hard to suddenly
have your best friend

01:57.965 --> 01:59.896
always hanging
with someone else.

01:59.896 --> 02:01.965
Mrph.

02:01.965 --> 02:05.310
I gotta see if there's
some way I can help.

02:05.310 --> 02:06.689
There's a little voice
inside me

02:06.689 --> 02:08.482
that can't stand to see
my friend suffer.

02:08.482 --> 02:10.482
Mrph rmh rmphm?

02:10.482 --> 02:12.103
I'm gonna go be
a good Christian.

02:22.862 --> 02:26.344
Okay, just the woodwinds
for this section.

02:32.344 --> 02:34.206
Hey, Tolkien!
What's goin' on?

02:34.206 --> 02:35.620
This is
the brass section.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.206
Yeah, I know.
I was just--

02:37.206 --> 02:38.620
I was noticing that
you're kind of hanging out

02:38.620 --> 02:39.931
a lot with Kyle lately.

02:39.931 --> 02:41.482
Is there a problem
with that?

02:41.482 --> 02:43.068
No, I think
it's amazing.

02:43.068 --> 02:44.448
It's awesome that someone
like you could be okay

02:44.448 --> 02:45.827
with someone like him,

02:45.827 --> 02:47.517
given all the new
information lately.

02:51.724 --> 02:53.793
You know, the stuff
that's come out about

02:53.793 --> 02:55.896
how the Jews stole
the Black race's identity,

02:55.896 --> 02:58.620
that the lost tribes of Judah
were actually all Africans.

03:02.586 --> 03:04.000
You didn't hear about this?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.448
Black people
are actually the Jews

03:05.448 --> 03:07.206
and people like Kyle
have taken that from them?

03:07.206 --> 03:09.862
- Stop talking to me.
- When the Jews
came to America

03:09.862 --> 03:11.862
to escape persecution
in World War II,

03:11.862 --> 03:13.379
they found that Blacks
were already the
underclass in America,

03:13.379 --> 03:14.793
so they had to invent
a story for themselves

03:14.793 --> 03:16.379
which they can make
everyone believe...

03:16.379 --> 03:18.172
...because
Kyle runs Hollywood!

03:23.448 --> 03:24.965
Kyle runs Hollywood, Tolkien.

03:39.655 --> 03:41.000
Hey, Stan.

03:42.206 --> 03:44.689
Guess what.
I have some good news for you.

03:44.689 --> 03:45.896
What?

03:45.896 --> 03:47.758
A little magic fairy
told me

03:47.758 --> 03:51.344
that you and Kyle are gonna
get back together soon.

03:51.344 --> 03:54.068
I don't care that Kyle
is making TikToks with Tolkien.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.862
Yes, you do.

03:55.862 --> 03:58.517
But don't worry, Stan.
It's almost Valentine's Day.

03:58.517 --> 04:00.379
And the little angel
on my shoulder

04:00.379 --> 04:02.931
says that Kyle is gonna come
running back to you any minute.

04:04.241 --> 04:05.620
Hey, Stan.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.620
Oh.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.482
Hey, Kyle.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.413
Rm!
Uh-huh.

04:10.413 --> 04:13.275
Well, dude,
- you wanna sit down?
- Oh, no sorry.

04:13.275 --> 04:15.413
I was actually just
seeing if you had a phone
charger I could borrow.

04:15.413 --> 04:16.758
Me and Tolkien are making
another TikTok video

04:16.758 --> 04:18.724
and my stupid phone died!

04:18.724 --> 04:20.241
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

04:22.482 --> 04:23.689
Thanks, dude!

04:23.689 --> 04:25.310
Tolkien,
I got one, dude!

04:27.103 --> 04:29.310
The fuck is going on?

04:29.310 --> 04:31.482
Well, um, I'm gonna
head back to class, guys.

04:33.448 --> 04:35.965
I don't get it. The little cupid
is always right.

04:35.965 --> 04:38.137
Mrph rmhmhm rm.

04:38.137 --> 04:40.103
Why didn't Tolkien listen?

04:41.827 --> 04:44.137
Did you tell him about
the Black Hebrew tribes?

04:44.137 --> 04:45.827
Yeah, I told him
everything, Cupid Ye!

04:45.827 --> 04:47.137
Tee hee hee!

04:47.137 --> 04:48.310
And did you tell him
how the Jews stole

04:48.310 --> 04:49.689
Black people's identity?

04:49.689 --> 04:51.620
Yeah, but it didn't work,
Cupid Ye.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.000
That's okay, Eric!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.793
Remember, being a good
Christian means

04:54.793 --> 04:56.413
helping people
even when it's hard.

04:56.413 --> 04:58.000
You're right, Cupid Ye.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Can you help make sure
Tolkien hears our message?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.206
Spreading information
is like spreading love.

05:02.206 --> 05:03.655
I'll help you
get the word out, Eric!

05:03.655 --> 05:05.551
Tee hee hee!
Tee hee hee!

05:05.551 --> 05:10.000
♪ All the pretty girls walk
like this, this, this ♪

05:10.000 --> 05:12.172
♪ This, this ♪

05:12.172 --> 05:16.172
♪ Pretty girls walk like
this, this, this, this ♪

05:16.172 --> 05:18.310
Wow, that's so cool, Tolkien.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.241
Look how many likes
we're getting for this one!

05:20.241 --> 05:22.137
Hey, Kyle,
you got a minute?

05:22.137 --> 05:23.413
Yeah. What's up?

05:23.413 --> 05:25.862
Well, there's
this rumor starting

05:25.862 --> 05:27.379
to go around the school.

05:27.379 --> 05:29.413
Kids are saying
that, like...

05:29.413 --> 05:31.448
I don't know, that,
like, you run Hollywood?

05:31.448 --> 05:33.000
What?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.931
I told Scott that
that's just people being dumb

05:34.931 --> 05:36.413
and he shouldn't listen
to stuff like that.

05:38.206 --> 05:40.724
But... Scott and I do
have this sweet movie idea

05:40.724 --> 05:42.241
about a dude
who has guns for hands

05:42.241 --> 05:44.000
and we have the first 20 pages
written, so...

05:46.310 --> 05:48.931
You don't really
run Hollywood, right?

05:48.931 --> 05:51.482
I'm not even going to
justify that with a response.

05:51.482 --> 05:53.758
Because repeating
a derogatory slur,

05:53.758 --> 05:55.241
even for the purpose
of refuting it,

05:55.241 --> 05:57.310
can make stupid
people think it's valid!

06:00.862 --> 06:02.482
Holy shit.
Kyle runs Hollywood.

06:02.482 --> 06:04.724
Kyle runs Hollywood,
and you fucked up the pitch!

06:04.724 --> 06:06.034
How'd I fuck
up the pitch?!

06:06.034 --> 06:07.620
You gotta tell him
what the stakes are.

06:07.620 --> 06:10.241
People who make movies, they
just care about the stakes!

06:10.241 --> 06:13.103
The guy has guns
for hands!

06:13.103 --> 06:16.724
Mr. Cartman, did you or did you
not tell students at this school

06:16.724 --> 06:19.034
That Kyle runs Hollywood?

06:19.034 --> 06:21.586
I think
I did say that, yes.

06:21.586 --> 06:23.896
And why would you say
such an intolerant,

06:23.896 --> 06:25.413
offensive thing like that?

06:25.413 --> 06:27.034
<i>Somebody</i>
runs Hollywood.

06:27.034 --> 06:28.965
Lots of people
run Hollywood!

06:28.965 --> 06:32.103
Yes, lots of...
people like Kyle.

06:32.103 --> 06:35.068
Mr. Cartman you are on dangerous
frickin ground here, buddy!

06:35.068 --> 06:36.655
I'm sorry,
why is it so offensive

06:36.655 --> 06:38.137
to say
who runs Hollywood?

06:38.137 --> 06:39.931
People like Hollywood.
Hollywood's cool.

06:39.931 --> 06:41.448
The Jews should be honored
to be in charge of it.

06:41.448 --> 06:43.931
Hey! I am telling you
right now, Eric.

06:43.931 --> 06:46.137
The next time anyone
says anything about

06:46.137 --> 06:48.000
Kyle running Hollywood,
that person

06:48.000 --> 06:49.896
Is gonna have
two months detention.

06:49.896 --> 06:51.896
Two months?!

06:51.896 --> 06:53.413
Jesus,
Mary mother full of grace.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.275
You guys really
take this seriously.

07:12.310 --> 07:15.344
Please help me be
the best Christian I can be.

07:15.344 --> 07:20.000
All I want is to help people,
but nobody understands.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.862
Please,
I can't do this alone.

07:22.965 --> 07:26.034
Tee hee hee!

07:26.034 --> 07:27.482
There you are, Cupid Ye!

07:27.482 --> 07:29.448
Sorry, Eric,
I was just busy

07:29.448 --> 07:31.896
praising our Savior's name
in the music studio!

07:31.896 --> 07:33.344
The Principal said
I can't talk about

07:33.344 --> 07:35.172
Kyle running Hollywood
anymore, Cupid Ye!

07:35.172 --> 07:37.827
Well, of course, Eric!
They're trying to silence you.

07:37.827 --> 07:39.482
That's what they do.

07:39.482 --> 07:41.000
Who's <i>they?</i>

07:41.172 --> 07:43.586
Oh right... <i>them.</i>

07:43.586 --> 07:45.344
Tee hee hee!
Jews!

07:45.344 --> 07:47.482
But Cupid Ye, I <i>have</i>
to get to Tolkien or else

07:47.482 --> 07:49.068
Stan is gonna be
sad forever!

07:49.068 --> 07:52.034
Okay! I'll help you help
your friend however I can.

07:52.034 --> 07:54.000
You're such a good
Christian, Eric.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.448
Thanks.

07:55.448 --> 07:57.137
Just don't do anything
too drastic, okay?

07:57.137 --> 07:58.620
What do you mean?

07:58.620 --> 08:00.310
I dunno know, it's just...

08:00.310 --> 08:01.965
ever since you changed your name
and got all into Jesus,

08:01.965 --> 08:03.448
you've been acting a little
bat shit crazy, Cupid Ye.

08:03.448 --> 08:05.413
Tee hee hee!
Don't worry, Eric!

08:05.413 --> 08:07.724
I'm gonna make
everything better!

08:11.931 --> 08:14.172
Praiiise Jesus!

08:17.448 --> 08:20.862
Tee hee hee!
Tee hee hee hee!

08:23.241 --> 08:26.586
The true Jews of Israel
are your Black ancestors...

08:26.586 --> 08:27.862
Tee hee hee...

08:27.862 --> 08:29.586
Huh?

08:29.586 --> 08:32.103
You think you and Kyle
make TikToks together?

08:32.103 --> 08:33.827
Kyle only cares
about money.

08:33.827 --> 08:35.068
Tee hee hee...

08:35.068 --> 08:36.413
Mmm?

08:36.413 --> 08:37.793
Think about it.

08:37.793 --> 08:39.413
Are you really
making TikToks <i>together,</i>

08:39.413 --> 08:42.275
or is Kyle
profiting off of you?

08:42.275 --> 08:44.862
It's just like
the lost tribes of Israel.

08:44.862 --> 08:47.551
Kyle wants to take all
the credit for what <i>you</i> doing.

08:47.551 --> 08:49.000
Tolkien?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.034
Oh, Jesus!

09:06.482 --> 09:08.344
Hey, I didn't see you
at the playground.

09:08.344 --> 09:09.896
Thought we were doing
that morning TikTok.

09:09.896 --> 09:11.413
Oh yeah, sorry.

09:11.413 --> 09:12.724
I didn't get
the best sleep last night.

09:12.724 --> 09:14.068
Everything okay?

09:14.068 --> 09:15.413
Hey, Kyle!
How's it going, man?

09:15.413 --> 09:16.931
Good, Jimmy. How are you?

09:16.931 --> 09:20.482
Great!
F-F-Fantastic!

09:24.655 --> 09:26.068
Is there something
you wanted, Jimmy?

09:26.068 --> 09:27.620
Oh, yeah!

09:27.620 --> 09:29.517
I just realized that I've never
given you my headshot.

09:29.517 --> 09:32.172
You know, just in case
anything ever comes up.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.517
Anything like what?

09:33.517 --> 09:34.862
Anything like...

09:34.862 --> 09:37.655
Anything you might need
my headshot for.

09:37.655 --> 09:39.965
Jimmy,
I do not run Hollywood!

09:39.965 --> 09:41.517
Well, that's not
what everyone's saying.

09:41.517 --> 09:44.275
Everyone! I do not
run Hollywood!

09:44.275 --> 09:46.413
Get a fucking clue!

09:47.862 --> 09:50.068
God dammit! This thing has
gotten out of control!

09:50.068 --> 09:52.724
Ah, it's not
a big deal.

09:52.724 --> 09:54.137
It's a <i>huge</i> deal!

09:54.137 --> 09:55.724
It's an attack on
my ethnicity, Tolkien.

09:55.724 --> 09:56.965
You don't understand!

09:56.965 --> 09:58.137
<i>I</i> don't understand?

09:58.137 --> 09:59.482
Yeah, Tolkien.

09:59.482 --> 10:01.482
There's lots of
Black people in the NBA,

10:01.482 --> 10:04.206
But nobody says, "The NBA
is run by Black people!"

10:04.206 --> 10:05.896
That's because the NBA
is run by white people!

10:05.896 --> 10:07.896
Okay, yeah, good point.

10:07.896 --> 10:09.344
Look, I'm sorry.

10:09.344 --> 10:10.620
You wanna just go make
the morning TikTok?

10:10.620 --> 10:12.517
Yeah, sure.
We still have time.

10:12.517 --> 10:14.310
Cool, come on.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.068
Stan?

10:22.068 --> 10:26.241
Sometimes,
Jesus works slowly.

10:26.241 --> 10:27.793
Stop talking to me.

10:39.793 --> 10:41.965
Hey, Ger. You got
a minute to talk?

10:41.965 --> 10:43.586
Yeah,
what's up, Randy?

10:43.586 --> 10:44.965
Look, I--

10:44.965 --> 10:46.758
I know that boys
will be boys

10:46.758 --> 10:48.827
and as parents,
we can't always control

10:48.827 --> 10:51.068
what their personal
decisions are.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.206
No, of course not.

10:53.206 --> 10:55.068
I just want you to know
first off that...

10:55.068 --> 10:57.275
your son
is a great kid.

10:57.275 --> 11:00.620
You know, Stan and Kyle
have always been really close,

11:00.620 --> 11:02.862
and I know their friendship
has meant so much.

11:02.862 --> 11:05.310
What's happened,
Randy?

11:06.724 --> 11:08.517
Well, Gerald,
I don't know

11:08.517 --> 11:10.862
if you can just <i>talk</i>
to your son but...

11:10.862 --> 11:13.344
can we just admit this whole
woke thing isn't working?

11:13.344 --> 11:14.965
Woke thing?

11:14.965 --> 11:17.068
I mean, it's been great
in so many ways,

11:17.068 --> 11:20.724
but now it's like <i>every</i>
movie and <i>every</i> TV show.

11:20.724 --> 11:23.172
You know, it's like,
you can see through it now.

11:23.172 --> 11:24.724
Audiences want to be <i>entertained.</i>

11:24.724 --> 11:26.137
They don't want
to be preached at,

11:26.137 --> 11:27.896
and if you're just
doing shows and movies

11:27.896 --> 11:29.689
that have like an agenda,
it's like--

11:29.689 --> 11:32.000
it's going to
keep failing.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.793
Randy, what are you
talking about?

11:33.793 --> 11:36.000
Box office is down,
people are tuning out.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.275
You know it's what killed
the Marvel franchise.

11:38.275 --> 11:40.724
And just as a side note,
I'm gonna say it out loud.

11:40.724 --> 11:44.000
"Avatar 2" sucked.
It just sucked, Gerald.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.517
Someone had to be brave
enough to say it.

11:45.517 --> 11:47.965
God dammit! I do not
fucking run Hollywood!

11:48.724 --> 11:50.344
Gerald,
can you talk to him?

11:50.344 --> 11:51.655
Kyle, what is he
talking about?!

11:51.655 --> 11:53.275
He's just being an idiot

11:53.275 --> 11:54.551
and listening to what
fucking Eric Cartman said!

11:54.551 --> 11:56.482
I did not hear it
from Eric Cartman.

11:56.482 --> 11:59.586
I heard it from a prominent,
respected artist on television.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.068
Who?!

12:01.068 --> 12:03.551
Our next guest is a world famous
rapper and artist

12:03.551 --> 12:05.827
who claims that the Jews
run Hollywood.

12:05.827 --> 12:07.965
What exactly
do you mean by that?

12:07.965 --> 12:10.758
Well, mostly I just mean
that Jews control everything

12:10.758 --> 12:12.517
we see on TV
and the movies.

12:12.517 --> 12:14.793
And why do you not want
to show your face right now?

12:14.793 --> 12:16.448
Well, that's 'cause
there's this one Jew--

12:16.448 --> 12:18.241
um, his name is Kyle.

12:18.241 --> 12:21.103
And he can totally retaliate me,
'cause he like, runs Hollywood.

12:22.586 --> 12:24.448
Yeah, and Jews try to silence
people all the time.

12:24.448 --> 12:25.689
Especially
Black people.

12:25.689 --> 12:27.517
Yeah, especially
Black people.

12:27.517 --> 12:29.517
<i>That's because of all
the new information lately.</i>

12:29.517 --> 12:31.275
<i>The new information about
how the chosen people</i>

12:31.275 --> 12:32.275
<i>were actually Africans.</i>

12:32.275 --> 12:33.517
So, you know,
Black people

12:33.517 --> 12:34.896
have really
been hurt by the Jews.

12:34.896 --> 12:36.931
Yeah, so Hitler actually
wasn't a bad guy.

12:36.931 --> 12:38.758
Yeah, so--
Whoa, whoa, Cupid Ye.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.000
That's going
a bit too far.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.517
He's just trying
to be shocking.

12:41.517 --> 12:43.517
What are you watching, honey?

12:43.517 --> 12:45.517
I have <i>no</i> idea.

12:51.241 --> 12:53.689
♪ Mommy? ♪ What is it, Caillou? ♪

12:53.689 --> 12:56.241
♪ Can I get Roblox
on my Xbox? ♪

12:56.241 --> 12:58.896
♪ Sure thing, Caillou,
as long as it's free ♪

12:58.896 --> 13:01.482
♪ Oh, for sure,
it is for free ♪

13:01.482 --> 13:03.310
Okay, wait, wait, cut.
Hang on.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.310
Let's try it again.
I think you forgot the words.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.586
Yeah, sorry.
I'm just tired.

13:07.586 --> 13:08.896
I didn't get
the best sleep last night.

13:08.896 --> 13:10.413
Maybe I should do
the mom part.

13:10.413 --> 13:12.000
Nah, you do the kid part.
It's funnier.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.862
Okay, yeah.
I guess you call the shots.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.310
What's that
supposed to mean?

13:16.310 --> 13:18.965
Just means
you're in charge.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.482
Oh, I'm in charge,

13:20.482 --> 13:22.172
Like I control things?

13:22.172 --> 13:24.689
Huh, are you gonna start saying
I run Hollywood now too?

13:24.689 --> 13:26.275
I didn't say
you run Hollywood.

13:26.275 --> 13:28.413
And honestly, I'm getting
kind of sick of hearing it.

13:28.413 --> 13:29.689
<i>You're</i>
sick of hearing it?

13:29.689 --> 13:31.137
Yeah,
I'm sick of hearing it.

13:31.137 --> 13:32.689
Oh, my God, are you
listening to yourself?

13:32.689 --> 13:34.931
You of all people should
have some compassion.

13:34.931 --> 13:36.931
Oh, really? Why me of
all people, Kyle?

13:36.931 --> 13:38.482
You seriously
don't know why?

13:38.482 --> 13:40.655
You know that Jews
have stood alongside Blacks

13:40.655 --> 13:42.413
since the Civil Rights
movement began, right?

13:42.413 --> 13:44.103
What does <i>that</i>
have to do with anything?

13:44.103 --> 13:46.000
I'm just saying I thought
you'd be a better friend.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.310
'Cause you're like...

13:47.310 --> 13:50.275
'Cause I'm like what?
Black?

13:50.275 --> 13:52.137
Oh my God,
this is so awesome.

13:52.137 --> 13:53.586
Whatever, Tolkien.

13:53.586 --> 13:54.793
Now you're gonna act
like I somehow

13:54.793 --> 13:56.068
did something
wrong to you.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.793
No, you didn't
do it to me.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.482
It just seems to work out that
way all the time for you people.

13:59.482 --> 14:00.827
You people?

14:00.827 --> 14:02.517
No, it works
that way for <i>you</i> people!

14:02.517 --> 14:04.827
You know what? I don't wanna
make TikToks with you anymore!

14:04.827 --> 14:06.551
I don't wanna make TikToks
with <i>you</i> anymore!

14:06.551 --> 14:10.034
Good!

14:11.724 --> 14:13.034
We did it.

14:13.034 --> 14:14.586
I can't believe we did it.

14:14.586 --> 14:17.655
Praise Christ! They'll probably
never talk again!

14:17.655 --> 14:20.000
And now Stan can have
his best friend back.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.206
Yeah, and we can spread
our Nazi message

14:23.206 --> 14:24.413
all over the world!

14:24.413 --> 14:26.482
Whoa, whoa,
okay, Cupid Ye.

14:26.482 --> 14:28.000
You mean our Christian message.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.689
It's the same thing.
Christian message, Nazi message.

14:30.689 --> 14:32.379
Hitler was
a great Christian.

14:32.379 --> 14:33.896
Cupid Ye, are you okay?

14:33.896 --> 14:35.172
Do you need to, like,
talk to somebody?

14:35.172 --> 14:36.689
I mean it.

14:36.689 --> 14:38.413
People have to die so that
the better races can live.

14:38.413 --> 14:42.137
Okay, Cupid Ye.
Time to go back inside.

14:42.137 --> 14:43.965
Tee hee hee hee!
Tee hee hee!

14:43.965 --> 14:45.827
Come on, let's go, Ye.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.137
I don't think so,
dawg!

14:47.137 --> 14:50.034
Let's go torch
some motherfuckers!

14:57.896 --> 15:00.206
Deathcon one, bitches!

15:01.448 --> 15:02.689
Yeeee?!

15:06.862 --> 15:09.620
Yeeeeeeeeeeee!

15:09.620 --> 15:11.379
Oh, shit.

15:14.448 --> 15:15.551
Yeah?

15:18.310 --> 15:19.793
Stan! We aren't safe!

15:19.793 --> 15:21.896
What?

15:21.896 --> 15:23.310
He's totally gone crazy.

15:23.310 --> 15:24.793
I don't think I can
reason with him anymore!

15:24.793 --> 15:25.862
Reason with who?

15:25.862 --> 15:27.448
Stan, listen to me.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.551
There's someone who's been
messing with Kyle and Tolkien.

15:29.551 --> 15:32.551
He said it was to be
a good Christian, but...

15:32.551 --> 15:35.034
But I think he's just been
using Christianity as an excuse

15:35.034 --> 15:36.931
to be a racist
piece of shit.

15:38.137 --> 15:39.448
What did you do?

15:39.448 --> 15:41.241
Not me, Stan!

15:41.241 --> 15:44.758
This is going to be extremely
hard to believe, but...

15:44.758 --> 15:46.137
There's a little
magic angel

15:46.137 --> 15:48.586
that comes each year
around Valentine's Day.

15:48.586 --> 15:51.275
He spreads love and brings
lonely people together.

15:51.275 --> 15:52.620
But this year
is different.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.896
Cupid me found Christ
and changed his name.

15:54.896 --> 15:57.965
And I have to find a way
to get him back on his meds.

15:57.965 --> 15:59.413
Dude, Cartman,
are you okay?

15:59.413 --> 16:00.896
Do you need to, like,
talk to somebody?

16:00.896 --> 16:03.000
Stan, do you believe
in Santa Claus?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.206
Yeah.

16:04.206 --> 16:05.793
Do you believe
in the Easter Bunny?

16:05.793 --> 16:07.206
I guess so.

16:07.206 --> 16:09.448
Then believe that tomorrow
is Valentine's Day...

16:09.448 --> 16:11.931
and there's no telling
what Cupid Ye is capable of.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.551
Happy Valentine's Day,
Clyde!

16:24.551 --> 16:26.448
Here's a Valentine
for you, Red!

16:28.517 --> 16:31.172
Ah, Valentine's day.
Isn't it nice?

16:31.172 --> 16:32.793
Love is in the air!

16:38.310 --> 16:40.310
♪ Dee deet deedle-y doo! ♪

16:40.310 --> 16:42.379
♪ I ain't sayin'
she's a gold digger ♪

16:42.379 --> 16:44.827
♪ But she ain't messin'
with no broke Jew ♪

16:48.793 --> 16:50.310
Who is it?
Tee-hee-hee!

16:50.310 --> 16:52.000
Hey! Asshole!

16:52.000 --> 16:54.310
Other people need
to use the bathroom, too!

17:01.517 --> 17:03.586
Whoa... Dude...

17:03.586 --> 17:05.344
Happy Valentine's Day,
bitch!

17:05.344 --> 17:06.586
What the hell?!

17:06.586 --> 17:08.034
How about a little
anti-Semitism?

17:08.034 --> 17:09.275
Ugh!

17:11.344 --> 17:14.241
Aahghgghgh!!!!

17:17.724 --> 17:19.000
Tee-hee-hee-hee!
Tee-hee-hee!

17:29.275 --> 17:30.689
What is that?!

17:35.862 --> 17:37.103
Tolkien!

17:37.103 --> 17:38.551
Tolkien,
I need to talk to you.

17:38.551 --> 17:39.862
About what?

17:39.862 --> 17:42.103
Tolkien...
I owe you an apology.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.896
Someone has been
messing with you...

17:43.896 --> 17:45.172
and it was all for me.

17:45.172 --> 17:46.758
I don't get it.

17:46.758 --> 17:49.448
I've been jealous about
you and Kyle's TikToks.

17:59.068 --> 18:00.827
Tee-hee-hee!
Tee-hee-hee-hee!

18:09.965 --> 18:11.413
Mr. Mackey [over P.A.]:
<i>Attention, students!</i>

18:11.413 --> 18:13.862
<i>There is a giant bee
in the school!</i>

18:13.862 --> 18:15.896
<i>Get somewhere safe!
There's a giant bee!</i>

18:15.896 --> 18:17.586
<i>Oh, Jesus, here it is!</i>

18:17.586 --> 18:19.310
Cupid Ye: <i>Tee-hee-hee-hee!
Tee-hee-hee!</i>

18:19.310 --> 18:21.517
Mr. Mackey: <i>Oh, God!
It's a bee!!</i>

18:21.517 --> 18:23.413
Look, there he is!

18:26.931 --> 18:28.862
What do you think
you're doing, Kyle?

18:30.413 --> 18:31.655
W-What do you mean?

18:31.655 --> 18:33.620
A "Lord of the Rings" prequel?!

18:33.620 --> 18:35.482
What were you thinking??

18:35.482 --> 18:38.068
How many more superheroes
do you think we need?!

18:38.068 --> 18:39.827
Mario Brothers, Kyle?!

18:39.827 --> 18:42.965
You seriously can't do better
than Mario Brothers?!

18:46.344 --> 18:47.586
That's enough,
you guys!

18:47.586 --> 18:48.620
Tolkien?

18:48.620 --> 18:49.862
I'm sorry, Kyle.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.413
It's not his fault,
it's mine!

18:51.413 --> 18:53.965
I was jealous of you guys
and your TikToks.

18:53.965 --> 18:57.275
What are you waiting for?!
Let's jack up these mofos!

18:57.275 --> 18:59.965
- Holy shit!
- What the hell is that?!

18:59.965 --> 19:01.724
Cupid Yeeeeeeee!

19:05.724 --> 19:07.931
Time to take your meds.

19:07.931 --> 19:10.172
No!
Those are how people control me!

19:10.172 --> 19:13.034
You're taking your meds, Ye,
one way or another!

19:17.827 --> 19:19.172
No! I'm not taking--

19:19.172 --> 19:20.379
- You're taking your medication!
- Let me go!

19:20.379 --> 19:21.862
I'm not t--You're taking it, Ye!

19:21.862 --> 19:25.172
Swallow it! Swallow it!

19:33.137 --> 19:35.310
Ye? Ye?

19:41.482 --> 19:42.862
Eric?

19:42.862 --> 19:44.241
Cupid me?!

19:44.241 --> 19:46.241
You guys! It's Cupid me!
He's back!

19:47.655 --> 19:49.413
What day is it?

19:49.413 --> 19:52.137
Why it's Valentine's Day,
Cupid me!

19:52.137 --> 19:53.413
Valentines Day?!

19:53.413 --> 19:55.482
Well, then, I need
to get to work!

19:55.482 --> 19:57.655
Tee-hee-hee-hee!
Tee-hee-hee!
Yeah!

19:58.965 --> 20:01.862
Tee-hee-hee-hee!
Tee-hee-hee!

20:08.655 --> 20:11.172
We have a young man
who is joining us here today

20:11.172 --> 20:13.896
to talk about stereotypes

20:13.896 --> 20:16.172
and the harm
that they can bring.

20:16.172 --> 20:19.655
Young man,
what is your message?

20:19.655 --> 20:22.896
My message is, we can't control
what people say.

20:22.896 --> 20:27.172
So we have to be smart
about what we choose to believe.

20:27.172 --> 20:29.206
If one idiot says
that a certain group

20:29.206 --> 20:31.896
"runs Hollywood,"
look into it.

20:31.896 --> 20:35.655
With very minimal effort,
you will find that "Hollywood"

20:35.655 --> 20:37.034
is a multi-tiered industry

20:37.034 --> 20:38.551
run by tens of thousands
of people

20:38.551 --> 20:41.689
from all over the world.

20:41.689 --> 20:44.724
In the past, Jews were shut out
of most professions.

20:44.724 --> 20:47.000
So they came to dominate
vaudeville, which back then

20:47.000 --> 20:49.551
was considered too low-brow
for good Christians.

20:49.551 --> 20:51.310
Those Jews eventually
moved West

20:51.310 --> 20:53.034
and started the first
movie studios

20:53.034 --> 20:55.655
when movies were also considered
work for the underclasses.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.068
And their descendants

20:57.068 --> 20:59.000
are now a decent percentage
of the thousands

20:59.000 --> 21:01.965
of people of all races
that make Hollywood run.

21:04.310 --> 21:06.482
This young man

21:06.482 --> 21:09.482
has said in plain words
what so many of us in Hollywood

21:09.482 --> 21:12.620
have been trying to get
people to understand.

21:12.620 --> 21:15.275
To hear it all so plain,
and so passionate.

21:15.275 --> 21:18.275
This kid thinks about things
the way we all need to.

21:18.275 --> 21:19.724
You know what I think?

21:19.724 --> 21:21.620
I think this kid should run
Hollywood!

21:21.620 --> 21:23.241
Yeah!

21:26.758 --> 21:28.620
Whoa, whoa--
Wait, what? Whoa.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.862
- Let him run Hollywood!
- Yeah! Give the kid a shot!

21:30.862 --> 21:33.793
- Come on!
- Let him do it!

21:33.793 --> 21:35.655
God damn it.

21:35.655 --> 21:44.068
Let the Jew run it!!

21:44.068 --> 21:46.068
Let the Jew run it!
