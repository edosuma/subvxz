00:57.440 --> 00:59.880
In September of 2007,

00:59.960 --> 01:02.840
Dr. Turner killed his wife,
Jennifer Turner,

01:03.080 --> 01:05.519
and several months after the killing,

01:05.600 --> 01:08.560
Dr. Turner was indicted by
the Davie County grand jury

01:08.640 --> 01:09.840
for first-degree murder.

01:09.920 --> 01:14.480
What did Dr. Turner say had happened
between him and his wife?

01:14.560 --> 01:19.120
Well, the killing occurred
in an outbuilding of the property

01:19.200 --> 01:21.000
that Dr. Turner and his wife

01:21.360 --> 01:26.120
had shared until they became separated,
about 18 months before the killing.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.280
And inside the building

01:28.360 --> 01:31.200
were just tons of stuff lying all around.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.640
One of the things that was lying around
was a large, seven-foot...

01:34.960 --> 01:38.320
I mean, for lack of a better term,
Viking spear

01:38.400 --> 01:41.920
that had about a 16-inch blade
on the end of it

01:42.000 --> 01:44.600
and Mrs. Turner picked up the spear

01:44.680 --> 01:48.320
and attacked him with it, driving it
through his leg, near his groin,

01:48.400 --> 01:51.320
through and through twice
and stabbing him on his arm.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.760
At that point in time,
he went into his pocket.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.600
He had a pocket knife with him

01:55.720 --> 01:58.120
and he used the pocket knife
to defend himself,

01:58.200 --> 02:00.960
and in the course of doing so,
inflicted the wounds that killed her.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.480
And did he, in fact,
have wounds on his leg

02:18.560 --> 02:22.040
that were consistent with
what he had said happened?

02:22.120 --> 02:24.800
Yes, he lost about a quarter
of his blood volume

02:24.880 --> 02:28.560
and one of those wounds
was about 1.5 centimeters

02:28.640 --> 02:30.000
from his femoral artery,

02:30.080 --> 02:32.800
which they also concluded would have
killed him if it had hit him.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.680
I’ll show you
what has been marked as Exhibit 27.

02:35.760 --> 02:36.600
Thanks.

02:38.160 --> 02:42.880
What was the initial opinion
that Agent Thomas had with regard to

02:43.440 --> 02:46.400
the shirt that Dr. Turner
had been wearing?

02:46.480 --> 02:48.400
"This transfer bloodstain pattern

02:48.480 --> 02:51.760
was consistent with a bloody hand
being wiped on the surface of the shirt."

02:52.360 --> 02:53.320
Alright.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.080
What does the second report say?

03:02.160 --> 03:05.160
It says, "It is consistent
with a pointed object,

03:05.240 --> 03:08.280
consistent with a knife being wiped
on the surface of the shirt."

03:08.760 --> 03:11.960
Was there any indication
in that second report

03:12.040 --> 03:15.480
that there had been a significant change?

03:16.160 --> 03:17.720
No, there wasn’t.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.240
What Special Agent Thomas
testified about

03:20.320 --> 03:23.560
is that the SBI and Special Agent
Deaver, who was working with him,

03:23.640 --> 03:26.600
had been presented with a new scenario

03:26.960 --> 03:30.480
that, in essence, he had inflicted
those wounds on himself

03:30.560 --> 03:32.920
and entirely staged the scene.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.080
Following that, they,
when looking at the shirt,

03:36.160 --> 03:40.040
"Could it possibly have been because
somebody was wiping a knife on the shirt?"

03:40.600 --> 03:44.640
Was that what he got out of
that meeting that Agent Deaver attended?

03:44.720 --> 03:46.480
- Yes.
- And then it says,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.560
"I’m going to meet with Duane
to do the actual reconstruction."

03:50.640 --> 03:51.600
Yes.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.520
- Who’s filming this?
- Special Agent Deaver.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.720
- He’s present there? Alright.
- He’s filming it, yes.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.400
I think what they
were trying to do is

04:08.680 --> 04:12.400
put blood on just the outside layers
of the knife

04:13.000 --> 04:14.760
in the hopes that it would somehow

04:14.880 --> 04:17.839
duplicate the initial stain, even though

04:17.920 --> 04:20.720
he didn't know of a scenario where
that would occur in actual real life,

04:20.800 --> 04:23.680
where you only have blood
on the absolute edges of a knife.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.040
Nice, good curve.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.440
Turn your wrist in.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.480
Oh, even better. Yeah, that's good.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.040
Alright, then you want to get some...

04:35.120 --> 04:37.920
just apply it on the fingers,
and just kind of...

04:40.200 --> 04:41.520
Up, up.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.480
Beautiful.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.160
That’s a wrap, baby.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.160
Not in any effort to recreate

04:49.240 --> 04:53.080
any scenario of what
actually happened that night,

04:53.440 --> 04:55.800
but just to create a stain

04:55.880 --> 04:59.640
that might look like another stain,
that might refute

05:00.080 --> 05:02.520
what our experts said about
what that stain was.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.560
There’s a bloodstain expert,
Stewart James.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.200
He’s universally regarded as one of the...

05:08.760 --> 05:11.840
handful, top two or three experts
in this field.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.960
He takes that... the video

05:15.440 --> 05:17.720
of the Kirk Turner blood experiments

05:17.800 --> 05:21.160
where Gerald Thomas wipes the shirt
and Duane Deaver is filming it,

05:21.560 --> 05:24.120
and he shows this video...

05:24.600 --> 05:29.040
uh, at professional conferences,
both in the United States and abroad.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.960
And the reaction in the community
of bloodstain pattern analysis,

05:34.560 --> 05:36.400
is... he says, it's shock.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.280
That everyone just looks
at these experiments and says,

05:39.480 --> 05:41.400
"That is a bunch of malarkey."

05:41.480 --> 05:44.000
It’s sort of what’s happening
in Mike Peterson’s

05:44.800 --> 05:47.000
motion for appropriate relief right now.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.200
You can, sort of, know
all of these anecdotal things,

05:50.280 --> 05:52.760
and you can experience them
in individual cases,

05:52.840 --> 05:55.360
like we did with Dr. Turner
and other cases,

05:55.640 --> 06:00.080
but once you see
all of those things synthesized

06:00.480 --> 06:04.600
and brought together
and woven into the same tapestry,

06:05.120 --> 06:07.640
it's pretty devastating to see,

06:08.040 --> 06:12.920
you know, what can pass for science
and justice in a courtroom.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.000
Thanks, we appreciate it.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.400
We're going to get lunch today, Deputy?

06:22.560 --> 06:24.120
We're working on it, Mike.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.760
What? This woman stabbed him
with a spear

06:27.840 --> 06:29.560
and then he cut her throat with...

06:29.640 --> 06:31.680
you know, this is not a good marriage.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.880
But anyway, but then when I read
that he...

06:37.080 --> 06:40.040
Duane Deaver believed
the man had taken a spear

06:40.320 --> 06:42.480
and put it through his leg.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.360
Man, I mean, it just

06:44.880 --> 06:49.160
boggles the mind to think that
anybody would come up with that.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.400
I got an orange.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.520
God!

07:03.760 --> 07:06.880
Yeah, feel how cool the sandwich is.
Just feel...

07:07.600 --> 07:08.760
feel how cold that is.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.480
Hm.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.560
Mm.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.800
Mrs. Sutton,
have you been qualified

07:28.880 --> 07:33.000
as an expert witness in the field
of bloodstain pattern analysis?

07:33.080 --> 07:34.040
Yes, sir, I have.

07:34.120 --> 07:39.280
I want to show you what Mr. Deaver
testified to at Mr. Peterson’s trial.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.160
I’m gonna ask for you to describe

07:42.240 --> 07:44.640
the types of experiments that you used

07:44.720 --> 07:48.680
and what the results were, generally.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.160
Test One was to place a source of blood

07:52.280 --> 07:56.680
a certain distance above the horizontal...
or above the ground,

07:56.840 --> 07:59.200
impact it with test shoes on,

07:59.320 --> 08:01.400
and to take a look at those spatters

08:01.520 --> 08:05.720
to determine if they were comparable
to what I found on the real shoes.

08:05.800 --> 08:06.640
Okay.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.760
But the wearer of these shoes,

08:33.240 --> 08:36.240
these shoes were actually
directly below

08:36.600 --> 08:40.720
a source of blood, which my opinion
is the back of the head of the victim,

08:41.039 --> 08:42.360
when it was impacted.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.320
Is there anything about
the experiments that you saw

08:46.840 --> 08:49.360
that in any way supports

08:49.840 --> 08:52.040
- Mr. Deaver’s opinion?
- No.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.320
The experiment won’t show that at all.

08:55.880 --> 09:00.320
What the experiment shows
is that if you impact a sponge,

09:00.680 --> 09:02.160
it’ll create spatter.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.360
That’s... that’s a given in my field.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.440
That’s a recreation.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.200
That’s trying to make
a set of circumstances

09:11.280 --> 09:13.960
and get a desired outcome.

09:14.360 --> 09:18.280
It’s not what I would classify
as an experiment.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.480
The opinion is that these pants

10:07.560 --> 10:09.960
are consistent with impact spatters,

10:10.040 --> 10:12.080
with a result of a forceful impact,

10:12.640 --> 10:16.040
and that the individual wearing
these pants at the time of that impact

10:16.120 --> 10:20.400
was in close proximity to the source
of blood when it was impacted.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.520
Was that experiment
that you just saw acceptable

10:24.600 --> 10:28.320
within the bounds
of bloodstain pattern analysis?

10:28.560 --> 10:31.760
No. The first thing
that really struck me was,

10:32.200 --> 10:37.280
as soon as he stepped into the stairway,
he pulled the short leg open.

10:37.680 --> 10:42.760
That’s not fair. If the question is,
"Can I take a step into the stairwell,

10:42.840 --> 10:46.360
hit somebody, and get spatter
back into my shorts,"

10:46.640 --> 10:50.400
then I have to do it
with as natural a motion as possible.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.600
One thing I did notice,

10:52.720 --> 10:57.600
the target was placed more towards
the center of the landing

10:57.680 --> 11:02.680
as opposed back where the area
of origin was actually calculated.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.240
And, of course, that’s so that
you can have one leg up.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.080
That certainly could be
one explanation, sure.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.360
If it was back further,
somebody'd be standing on the landing,

11:12.480 --> 11:14.640
they wouldn’t have their leg up,
would they?

11:14.720 --> 11:18.000
I agree with that and it would also be
difficult to hit that sponge.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.760
Are the experiments that you used

11:20.840 --> 11:24.560
consistent with
what others in the field use

11:24.640 --> 11:27.480
to conduct analysis
of bloodstain pattern...

11:27.560 --> 11:29.120
- Yes. Yes, they are.
- ...examinations?

11:29.200 --> 11:34.480
Is it consistent with the methodology
that you learned 15, 16 years ago?

11:34.560 --> 11:35.760
Yes, it is.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.920
- Is that true?
- No, sir.

11:39.400 --> 11:43.360
Is his methodology, as you saw
in these experiments, what others,

11:43.720 --> 11:47.120
who are competent in the field
of bloodstain pattern analysis use

11:47.280 --> 11:49.640
- to analyze crime scenes?
- No, sir.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.000
No, sir.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.160
Hey!

11:58.920 --> 12:00.120
Happy birthday.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.400
I didn't think you were coming.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.680
Hey, good to see you.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.400
I’m glad you were able
to finally get here.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.720
You can't shake hands.

12:43.640 --> 12:46.120
Remain seated. Come to order.
Court is back in session.

12:52.520 --> 12:56.560
Could you state your name and spell your
last name for the court reporter, please?

12:56.640 --> 13:00.640
Ronald Thomas Guerette.
G-U-E-R-E-T-T-E.

13:00.720 --> 13:05.160
Before becoming a private investigator,
what was your profession?

13:05.720 --> 13:07.280
I was a police officer.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.720
I was a police officer in Arvada,
Colorado for a couple years.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.640
Then I was a police officer
in Charlotte for about ten years.

13:13.960 --> 13:18.080
When did you first get involved
in the case of State vs. Michael Peterson?

13:18.520 --> 13:20.960
About a week after December the 9th.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.400
Of what year?

13:24.200 --> 13:27.280
- Ten years ago. 2001.
- 2001? Alright.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.960
In connection with this hearing,
did you review

13:31.040 --> 13:35.520
all of the discovery that was provided
by the state of North Carolina

13:35.600 --> 13:38.480
in response to the orders
that were issued by Judge Hudson?

13:38.560 --> 13:41.080
I did. Well over 100,000 pages,

13:41.160 --> 13:43.480
many CDs, and disks, and...

13:43.800 --> 13:47.000
- And you reviewed all of that? Alright.
- Unfortunately.

13:47.080 --> 13:51.360
Did you review some reports
that Duane Deaver

13:51.760 --> 13:53.920
either authored or was mentioned in?

13:54.040 --> 13:55.080
Yes, sir.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.320
How many cases

14:00.400 --> 14:05.000
of bloodstain pattern analysis
or evaluations have you actually worked?

14:05.840 --> 14:09.120
I don’t know for sure, but it would be
somewhere around 200

14:09.200 --> 14:11.480
that I have written reports on myself.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.640
Now, that doesn’t include the number
of cases that I have

14:14.720 --> 14:16.520
looked at as part of my training.

14:16.840 --> 14:19.760
And I continue to provide help
to others who are in training.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.640
I help them with their cases

14:21.720 --> 14:24.080
and I wouldn’t necessarily write
a report on that.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.120
Were you able to compare

14:26.360 --> 14:29.320
the results of your analysis of...

14:30.040 --> 14:33.080
the reports that he wrote
with his testimony?

14:33.480 --> 14:35.120
Yes, I was.

14:36.280 --> 14:41.080
How many cases were there
in total in which Agent Deaver

14:41.160 --> 14:45.920
just observed bloodstains
either at the scene,

14:46.240 --> 14:49.520
at the SBI laboratory,
or by looking at photos?

14:50.240 --> 14:51.880
Only 54.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.720
In how many of those cases
did Agent Deaver provide

14:54.800 --> 14:57.560
a bloodstain pattern analysis opinion?

14:57.760 --> 14:58.600
Thirty-six.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.760
In how many of those cases

15:00.840 --> 15:05.440
did Agent Deaver actually go
to the scene of an event?

15:05.640 --> 15:10.960
Well, he went to 17 different scenes
between 1987 and 2003.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.960
How many cases were there

15:13.040 --> 15:15.760
in which Agent Deaver performed

15:15.840 --> 15:19.920
tests or experiments
before the Peterson case?

15:20.440 --> 15:21.320
Three.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.360
- Only three.
- What was the date

15:24.440 --> 15:28.880
of the last experiment that Agent Deaver
conducted on his own

15:29.520 --> 15:31.720
before the Peterson case?

15:32.360 --> 15:36.160
Back in 1991.
Eleven years before.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.640
How many cases where there in which
Agent Deaver, before the Peterson case,

15:40.720 --> 15:44.280
- found a precise point of impact?
- Zero.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.920
I think Agent Deaver also gave
some testimony about falls

15:48.000 --> 15:52.080
- and investigating falls, correct?
- That is correct. And stairs.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.160
Have you ever analyzed...

15:54.640 --> 15:59.960
bloodstain evidence from a situation
that was known to be a fall?

16:02.040 --> 16:03.120
Well...

16:03.960 --> 16:08.320
yes, I have been to
probably fifteen times where

16:08.680 --> 16:11.600
it was reported that a fall had occurred.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.960
Probably five or six of those times

16:15.240 --> 16:17.640
I was in agreement
that a fall was involved.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.520
The rest of the those, I was not
in agreement that a fall was involved

16:21.600 --> 16:25.040
or created the spatters,
the patterns that were seen there.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.720
Mr. Guerette,
how many of Agent Deaver's cases

16:30.800 --> 16:34.720
did you find in which
he had gone to the scene of a fall

16:34.800 --> 16:36.760
to analyze it in some way?

16:37.120 --> 16:40.760
Well, I checked every word
on every page in these documents

16:40.840 --> 16:43.280
and the word "falls" never occurred.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.200
- That’s all I have, Your Honor. Thank you.
- Alright, you can come down, sir.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.920
Hey!

17:11.720 --> 17:13.800
Good to see...
Oh, look at those teeth!

17:15.079 --> 17:17.560
So, are you alive, or what?
Are you alive?

17:17.680 --> 17:20.400
Are you alive?
You've been hobbling around all day.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.560
Let's see you move!

17:21.640 --> 17:23.960
- Yes! Yes! I'm fine.
-

17:24.160 --> 17:26.560
It looks like it's going well.
Like, really well, right?

17:26.640 --> 17:29.280
It really is. Yeah, it really is.
There's...

17:30.720 --> 17:32.480
I mean, you never know, of course,

17:32.680 --> 17:35.120
but I would think he will

17:35.640 --> 17:37.120
rule in my favor.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.920
Freaking, that'd be amazing, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.080
No! It's supposed to be
the way it's supposed to be.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.640
Either way, it's amazing.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.960
Well, here it is!

17:45.040 --> 17:49.720
So with any kind of luck,
I'll be out of here, you know...

17:50.840 --> 17:51.720
soon.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.160
Obviously, that's what
we're all hoping for.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.240
Yes.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.400
But it'd be so amazing
for that to happen.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.760
- I know. I know.
- Right?

17:59.840 --> 18:03.760
Yesterday, there was around 217 articles

18:04.160 --> 18:06.360
from local papers
to the Washington Post.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.000
On what?

18:08.080 --> 18:11.480
Well, they're just basically talking about
how all the experts

18:11.560 --> 18:14.160
- are discrediting Deaver.
- Oh, yeah.

18:14.240 --> 18:18.320
But he really did convict me
with his points of origin

18:18.560 --> 18:21.400
and "the head had to be right here,

18:21.480 --> 18:24.440
and so, therefore,
if the head's right here,

18:24.520 --> 18:28.080
all the blood had to have been hit
and on there."

18:28.240 --> 18:31.680
- And that's just bullshit.
- Well, it's so convincing, right?

18:31.760 --> 18:34.200
When you can get so specific and say
it happened here, there,

18:34.280 --> 18:37.120
- and there, it's--
- Yeah, there's no question.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.600
And the thing with the shorts
and the tennis shoes

18:39.680 --> 18:44.800
and what David picked up, and I had
missed also, the second time was

18:44.880 --> 18:48.600
the first-degree murder charge,
premeditation,

18:48.680 --> 18:51.160
only came because of Deaver.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.760
Enough about me.
We've all seen me. I'm sick of me.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.360
Tell me about you, kid.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.840
- Man, my life has changed night and day.
-

18:59.040 --> 19:01.840
- I've got this best friend...
-

19:02.080 --> 19:04.960
this girl named Jasmine,
and she's lived there for...

19:05.040 --> 19:08.200
- I got to come closer. I can't hear.
-

19:09.800 --> 19:11.880
Yeah, so, you want to stand up?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.560
- You can stand up.
- Sit down.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.400
They're making too much damn noise.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.760
- Can't you hear that shit down there?
- Yeah.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.520
- It's buffered, it's buffered here.
- It's coming in my ear.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.200
What the fuck are they doing?

19:27.560 --> 19:30.920
Okay. Well, when am I gonna
become a grandfather again?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.520
I'm working on it, very hard,
I'll have you know.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.560
- I'm working on it, hard.
- Good!

19:35.640 --> 19:36.600
Yes, sir.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.480
- Time's up, sir.
- Okay.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.560
I gotta go.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.000
- OK.
- I love you very much, Dad.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.160
And put it there.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.920
OK. I love you and I'm so glad
to see you again.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.560
I'll see you.
I'll see you. Alright.

20:33.720 --> 20:38.280
Not to jump the gun in any way,
but we want to try to be prepared...

20:38.360 --> 20:40.480
- Right.
- just in case this goes our way.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.960
- Which I don’t know is gonna happen.
- I understand. I understand.

20:45.600 --> 20:50.960
But anyway, so, we’ve put together
about $300,000 worth of property.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.000
Okay.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.680
Actually, a little bit more than that,
but enough property that will secure

20:55.760 --> 20:57.880
- a $300,000 bond.
- Okay.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.520
Kerry has checked into
electronic monitoring.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.400
- Joan Miner...
- Right.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.760
has agreed to allow you to stay there
for as long as you need to.

21:07.840 --> 21:08.880
OK.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.840
And I need to talk with her to ask her

21:10.920 --> 21:13.640
if she’s also willing to be
a third party custodian,

21:13.720 --> 21:17.280
which simply means,
if you don’t come home one night...

21:18.200 --> 21:20.280
- not only... No.
- She goes to jail.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.680
Not only would the monitor go off,
but she would call...

21:23.760 --> 21:25.680
- Okay.
- the sheriff and say, "Hey,

21:25.760 --> 21:27.920
- he's not here."
- Okay.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.320
- All right?
- And what do you think? Seriously?

21:31.880 --> 21:35.880
I think the same thing I thought
before the verdict came in, Mike.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.280
Okay... all right.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.320
- I mean, what can I say?
- I know.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.880
And...

21:43.760 --> 21:45.560
- we’ll finish today.
- Okay.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.560
- All right? All right.
- All right.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.480
- Hang in there. All right.
- Okay, sure.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.240
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, David. Okay, all right.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.720
I feel like I’m coming out

22:00.800 --> 22:04.280
the other side of a really
dark tunnel that I’ve been in

22:04.360 --> 22:06.080
with regard to this case.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.920
And it’s different.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.520
I don’t think anything will ever heal

22:11.680 --> 22:13.320
what I felt

22:14.360 --> 22:18.640
when that jury came back
in October of 2003. The...

22:20.640 --> 22:23.360
It was as devastating

22:24.000 --> 22:26.400
a moment as I’ve ever had professionally.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.520
So, that won’t heal.
That won’t go away.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.280
But I do feel like...

22:35.240 --> 22:36.480
a weight...

22:37.080 --> 22:39.440
has sort of been lifted a little bit,

22:39.520 --> 22:41.480
if we get a new trial. Now if...

22:41.680 --> 22:46.200
if we don’t get a new trial,
I will feel crushed...

22:47.000 --> 22:48.240
all over again.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.520
And so, there’s a part of me that’s...

22:52.320 --> 22:55.320
very scared about what’s gonna happen,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.720
because I don’t want to be crushed again.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.280
Silence in the court.
Please be seated.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.920
Judge Hudson...

23:06.520 --> 23:09.480
what do we know now that we didn’t,

23:09.960 --> 23:13.800
and couldn’t have, known in 2003?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.400
We know Duane Deaver misled the court

23:16.480 --> 23:18.760
and the jury about his training
and experience,

23:19.280 --> 23:22.080
that he mislead the court
and the jury about points of impact,

23:22.760 --> 23:25.400
that he mislead the court
and the jury about the experiments,

23:25.680 --> 23:30.320
that he had a pattern and practice
of having a strong bias for the state,

23:30.400 --> 23:34.600
writing misleading reports
and giving misleading testimony.

23:35.640 --> 23:40.480
Now, you had indicated
that you had worked 200 cases

23:40.760 --> 23:44.560
and that you had been involved
in roughly 500 cases.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.520
Yeah. That was an estimate.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.760
Let’s give Agent Deaver
the benefit of the doubt

23:50.520 --> 23:54.120
and just put aside
the 300 he claimed he did,

23:54.360 --> 23:56.040
which there's no reports for.

23:56.120 --> 23:59.120
What about the 200 he claimed
he did reports for?

24:00.440 --> 24:01.840
That was a lie.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.160
There’s no nicer way to say it.

24:05.960 --> 24:10.920
He lied. He only went
to seventeen scenes total,

24:11.280 --> 24:15.800
and none of those involved a fall.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.680
Not a single one.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.640
I have no doubt that a source of blood
was out there,

24:23.120 --> 24:27.640
and that it was impacted, creating those,
and that they are not on a surface.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.280
Mr. Deaver brings, sort of,
new meaning to the phrase,

24:31.400 --> 24:34.120
"Often wrong, but never in doubt."

24:35.280 --> 24:40.040
He testified that way, as the court,
I’m sure, will remember

24:40.960 --> 24:45.520
all the way through this trial,
on and on and on.

24:45.600 --> 24:50.320
We didn’t know at the time that he
had left out of all his lab reports

24:50.680 --> 24:52.880
negative confirmatory results.

24:52.960 --> 24:57.720
And the reason he didn’t put
those negative confirmatory tests in

24:57.800 --> 24:59.720
was because he didn’t want
the defense to have it,

25:00.040 --> 25:02.520
because they might "confuse” the jury

25:03.160 --> 25:04.960
by pointing out the truth.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.120
He wasn't just an expert.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.760
He actually became an advocate

25:10.840 --> 25:14.120
for the guilt of the people
whose cases he worked on.

25:14.840 --> 25:17.320
He did it in Mr. Peterson’s case.

25:18.800 --> 25:22.640
And we know he did it
in Greg Taylor’s case back in 1991.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.200
Not only does he do testing that’s
not accepted by anyone in the field,

25:28.760 --> 25:33.320
but then with regard to one
of the critical opinions he gives,

25:33.800 --> 25:36.440
he bases it entirely

25:37.040 --> 25:38.480
on this testing

25:39.440 --> 25:43.520
and testifies to the jury that
that’s what proves Michael Peterson

25:43.840 --> 25:47.320
was there in the stairway,
hitting Kathleen.

25:48.520 --> 25:51.760
And you relied on these
experiments in reaching your opinions,

25:51.840 --> 25:53.360
- did you not?
- Yes, I did.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.800
As a matter of fact,
there were several opinions

25:55.880 --> 25:58.600
that you’ve testified to in front
of this jury that...

25:58.880 --> 26:02.120
you wouldn’t have testified to
without those experiments, correct?

26:08.280 --> 26:09.280
Yes.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.960
For example, your opinion about
the cause of the spatter

26:13.040 --> 26:15.280
inside of Mr. Peterson’s shorts.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.880
That was an opinion you wouldn’t have
given without the experiments, right?

26:20.280 --> 26:21.120
Yes.

26:21.200 --> 26:25.600
It all boils back
to his ridiculous experiment

26:25.680 --> 26:29.040
and the little victory dance
that Susie Barker did

26:29.320 --> 26:31.760
when he finally was able
to get it into his shorts.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.360
That’s the critical testimony

26:41.800 --> 26:44.000
that basically says it’s a beating

26:44.680 --> 26:47.040
and Michael Peterson committed it.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.920
And there is no other evidence
in this trial,

26:50.240 --> 26:51.800
Deborah Radisch included,

26:52.680 --> 26:55.240
who could ever say
it was Michael Peterson.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.840
It’s not just new evidence, Your Honor,

26:57.920 --> 27:02.200
it violates Mr. Peterson’s
constitutional right to due process.

27:02.280 --> 27:06.720
You have a right not to be tried
with fabricated evidence,

27:06.800 --> 27:09.000
and that's what happened in this case.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.360
I’m therefore gonna ask the Court
at this time,

27:13.160 --> 27:18.200
as hard as that is,
given the length of this trial,

27:18.280 --> 27:22.720
to grant Michael Peterson
a trial at which the evidence

27:22.960 --> 27:26.840
can be presented in a fair way,
and an unbiased way,

27:27.320 --> 27:29.520
and then let a jury of twelve

27:30.360 --> 27:32.960
sort it out.
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:33.320 --> 27:36.840
One of the most important
things about the criminal justice system

27:36.920 --> 27:39.040
is the verdict of the jury.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.440
I will ask the Court,
looking at the record,

27:42.520 --> 27:44.800
what is the newly discovered evidence?

27:45.360 --> 27:48.120
There is no newly discovered evidence.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.280
The same old, same old,
same old thing.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.120
The defendant must show this court

27:54.520 --> 27:57.320
that, had they gotten
all this information,

27:57.480 --> 28:00.080
that the jury
would have decided differently.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.720
The blood spatter, the blood patterns,

28:04.240 --> 28:07.640
the wiping of the blood off the wall,
blood drops,

28:08.680 --> 28:10.280
spatter on shoes,

28:11.280 --> 28:13.480
spatter inside of pants.

28:14.080 --> 28:17.480
When you look at the injuries to her head,

28:17.840 --> 28:22.360
when you look at how she laid
in that stairwell,

28:22.440 --> 28:24.960
when you look at the sweatpants

28:25.080 --> 28:26.760
with a footprint

28:27.520 --> 28:29.160
on the back of her leg,

28:29.640 --> 28:31.520
and when the medical examiner testified,

28:31.600 --> 28:34.520
based on her training and experience,
and now she’s a chief medical examiner,

28:34.880 --> 28:37.960
that this was not an accident,

28:38.960 --> 28:42.200
how in the world would a jury
find it different because of Mr. Deaver,

28:42.280 --> 28:44.200
a reasonable doubt,

28:44.640 --> 28:48.720
is reasoned based on
common everyday sense.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.560
It does not take a rocket scientist

28:53.200 --> 28:56.560
to look at Kathleen Peterson,
the back of her head,

28:56.960 --> 29:01.240
the blood every which a way,
way up in the air, on the ceiling,

29:01.400 --> 29:03.640
and say that that was an accident?

29:05.480 --> 29:06.680
Judge, I'll ask that you follow

29:06.760 --> 29:08.720
the outline
of North Carolina Supreme Court

29:08.800 --> 29:12.360
and North Carolina Court of Appeals
and uphold this righteous verdict.

29:13.760 --> 29:14.920
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:25.160 --> 29:30.080
All right. Has Mr. Peterson proven
that Duane Deaver

29:30.440 --> 29:34.160
misled the court
into allowing him to express

29:34.360 --> 29:37.800
certain opinions that you put up
on the board?

29:38.280 --> 29:41.680
The answer to that question is yes.

29:42.840 --> 29:47.280
Has Peterson proven
that Duane Deaver misled the jury

29:47.360 --> 29:50.960
about the validity
of certain of his arguments?

29:51.120 --> 29:54.160
The answer to that question is yes.

29:55.160 --> 29:59.720
Was Deaver’s false and misleading
testimony material?

29:59.800 --> 30:03.200
The answer to that question is yes.

30:04.200 --> 30:09.160
Is a new trial required
for newly discovered evidence,

30:09.400 --> 30:14.320
due process violations,
and for perjured testimony?

30:14.400 --> 30:18.080
The answer to those questions is yes.

30:19.240 --> 30:24.000
It will be the court’s order
that Mr. Peterson receive a new trial.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.160
About time.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.600
Come on.

30:29.880 --> 30:30.880
Thank you.

31:08.680 --> 31:10.200
Now it’s so good to have you back.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.920
What do you mean "now"?

31:18.080 --> 31:20.240
It’s impossible to say what happened,

31:20.400 --> 31:23.560
but I know my father didn’t kill Kathleen.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.760
I loved Kathleen more than anything,

31:25.960 --> 31:27.400
but he didn't do it.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.000
He told me and I know it.
I believe it in my heart.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.360
Thanks.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.800
Oh, God.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.000
Oh!

31:43.080 --> 31:45.280
- Honest to God, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.480
I appreciate it. It was just fantastic.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.360
I’m... I’ll be crying a while.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.480
Well, Michael...

31:52.560 --> 31:55.000
God, that was quick. I did not believe it.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.160
You know, I told you when I went
to visit you

32:00.240 --> 32:01.720
the first time after the verdict...

32:01.800 --> 32:02.640
Right.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.320
- ...how devastated I was by that.
- I know.

32:06.240 --> 32:09.680
You also told me it might be harder
on you than me and I told you,

32:09.760 --> 32:13.400
"Wait a minute, you’re leaving in
your goddamned BMW and I’m going back."

32:14.760 --> 32:17.440
I understand, but having said that,

32:17.560 --> 32:19.680
- this has weighed on me for eight years.
- I know it has.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.360
Oh, God, I’m so happy.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.320
Jesus Christ.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.400
- Eight years.
- I told your kids,

32:26.480 --> 32:30.400
"I’m getting tired of this.
He gets convicted and you guys cry.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.280
He gets a new trial
and you guys still cry."

32:33.360 --> 32:34.880
We’re a very emotional family.

32:34.960 --> 32:39.280
Now, my goal is to walk you out
of this courthouse this afternoon.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.440
- We’ll see if we can do that. We'll try.
- Oh, God.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.680
That would be wonderful.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.800
All right, all right.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.640
We might have to carry you, but...

32:45.720 --> 32:48.360
No. I’m much better right now.

32:48.720 --> 32:52.240
I suspect that some of that
was just stress.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.000
You think?

32:54.080 --> 32:56.000
Like my high blood pressure?
Yeah.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.280
Okay. All right. Thank you.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.320
- Thank you.
- You can relax now.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.720
Enjoy your gourmet lunch.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.760
Oh, listen to this... Oh, fuck it.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.760
- All right. We’ll see you at 2:30.
- All right. Okay.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.680
- Thank you, David.
- Okay.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.240
And you, too, Ron.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.040
- Oh, God!
-

33:30.680 --> 33:33.720
Oh, God, oh, God, I’m so happy.

33:35.120 --> 33:38.440
It wouldn't have happened
without you guys.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.600
You know that? I know that.

33:40.680 --> 33:44.640
I know that... I knew that from
the very beginning, when I told you,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.920
Jean, the first time we talked,

33:48.480 --> 33:50.040
I told you

33:50.280 --> 33:53.000
I wanted it filmed.
I wanted a complete...

33:53.600 --> 33:54.720
uh...

33:54.800 --> 33:57.160
history of everything that was done.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.720
And you’ve been there from the beginning.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.640
I don't think...

34:03.720 --> 34:05.280
I don't think any...

34:06.840 --> 34:08.600
There would be no retrial,

34:09.760 --> 34:12.400
I don’t think, without--
Well, with all that happened,  but...

34:12.960 --> 34:15.480
what you guys did
has just been fantastic.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.320
I’m so grateful.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.840
I have kept everything inside of me

34:20.199 --> 34:24.080
for years, and years, and years.

34:24.719 --> 34:27.120
I think I could go on a roll now

34:27.560 --> 34:29.800
and I could cry about Kathleen

34:30.120 --> 34:33.520
and I could cry about my mother,
I could cry about my father,

34:33.960 --> 34:36.360
I could cry about Margaret
and Martha...

34:36.880 --> 34:38.600
Clayton and Todd.

34:39.040 --> 34:43.600
Oh, all the things that we’ve all
gone through and suffered.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.159
They would just...

34:45.239 --> 34:49.880
There’s just this ocean of tears
inside of me and...

34:55.199 --> 34:57.160
Now, I just want to just breathe.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.240
We went to the gas station today

35:22.320 --> 35:25.440
and Margaret and Martha were on
the front page of the newspaper, right?

35:25.520 --> 35:28.520
- But in a good way this time.
- Yeah, we were hugging.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.880
So, we had Margaret
hold up the newspaper

35:30.960 --> 35:34.640
in the middle of a public location.
Like, "Margaret, come on, take a photo."

35:34.720 --> 35:37.240
And... something we would have
never done before.

35:37.320 --> 35:41.240
There were a number of people who came up,
like the photographer that’s like,

35:41.320 --> 35:43.800
"I work for a newspaper,
I’m not allowed to have an opinion,

35:43.880 --> 35:47.080
- but I’m really happy for you!"
- Yes, so many times.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.400
Just walking around Durham,
it's like you feel that label

35:50.480 --> 35:52.640
- of Peterson over your head.
- Yeah.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.200
You're concerned that people
look at you a certain way,

35:55.280 --> 35:57.680
But, like, for the first time,
I was standing up...

35:57.760 --> 36:00.240
- Yeah!
- walking around, like, "Peterson, yeah!”

36:00.320 --> 36:02.640
It feels good to be in Durham now.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.840
- Yeah. It's not sad.
- We went to the cemetery today.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.160
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.560
- It was beautiful.
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.

36:10.640 --> 36:14.360
- The beautiful tree, the roses. Yeah.
- The rosebush. That’s great!

36:14.880 --> 36:16.920
It was really different this time.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.520
I mean, it was sad,
but it was also amazing.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.840
- Yeah.
- Yeah, to have that...

36:23.080 --> 36:25.920
Like, I mean, 'cause it's so fresh,
like the...

36:26.160 --> 36:29.440
memory of her death and the funeral,

36:29.520 --> 36:33.360
but to go there with this new...

36:34.560 --> 36:37.640
feeling was just...
it was pretty remarkable...

36:37.720 --> 36:39.120
- Yeah.
- to be there.

36:58.240 --> 36:59.960
- Nine eighty-six.
- Nine eighty-six.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.120
We’re taking you to get dressed up.
Wait right here.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.080
See that mirrored dome down there?

37:45.200 --> 37:47.760
Well, you're gonna put on your coat
and a neck tie.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.040
Okay.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.720
- It might be in the bag. Okay.
- I got a belt right here.

38:00.800 --> 38:01.720
I got you.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.600
And my shoe laces, for the tennis shoes.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.120
- The shoe laces are in the bag over there.
- Okay.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.960
- Move!
- Yeah.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.520
I’m right in the Durham County Jail.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.480
He’s not even here yet.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.880
Go, Michael!

40:04.480 --> 40:06.160
Do it, Michael!

40:08.360 --> 40:10.160
Over eight years...

40:10.920 --> 40:14.720
2,988 days, as a matter of fact,

40:15.080 --> 40:16.520
that I counted,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.120
for an opportunity to have a retrial.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.360
I want to thank Judge Hudson

40:21.840 --> 40:24.040
for giving me that opportunity,

40:24.280 --> 40:26.040
so that I can vindicate myself

40:26.480 --> 40:30.080
and prove my innocence,
in a fair trial this time.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.040
I want to thank all the people
who have supported me

40:34.120 --> 40:36.000
from all over the world.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.960
It’s impossible
for me to express my gratitude.

40:41.480 --> 40:45.760
What I want to do now, though,
is to spend time with my family

40:46.120 --> 40:49.080
and with my children, and certainly

40:50.200 --> 40:53.960
at a later time, I’d be happy to talk
with everybody and share more.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.880
Thank you very, very much.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.760
Mr. Peterson, what's
the first thing you plan to do tonight?

41:00.480 --> 41:02.280
There you go, Dad. Please come in.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.880
Oh, Michael!

41:07.400 --> 41:09.240
I know! Hi, guys!

41:09.320 --> 41:11.840
-
-

41:18.360 --> 41:21.320
So, I’m interested in
how much buzzing this...

41:21.400 --> 41:22.960
It’ll keep you up all night.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.720
Well, I was thinking something...

41:24.800 --> 41:27.960
I can honestly say I tried it
and the only time it buzzed,

41:28.040 --> 41:30.880
the transmitter buzzed when I needed
to charge it, I forgot to plug it in.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.320
- Oh, good.
- Mr. Peterson, this paperwork

41:33.400 --> 41:35.840
pretty much says that this is
electronic monitoring equipment

41:35.920 --> 41:38.760
that belongs to Michael King’s company,
Reliant Monitoring.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.080
We will make you a copy and make...

41:40.160 --> 41:41.200
What is today?

41:41.280 --> 41:43.840
- 12/15, that ought to be right.
- Today is 12/15.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.000
"This is your current address."

41:49.440 --> 41:51.760
I'll be able to finally become a Buddhist!

41:51.840 --> 41:53.000
It should be okay.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.080
Om!

41:56.160 --> 41:59.040
- Spoiled already.
- Oh, he’s a momma’s boy.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.480
Oh, right.

42:00.720 --> 42:01.960
We’ll change that.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.400
We’ll change that.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.400
Well, you guys both ended up
momma’s boys too, right?

42:10.480 --> 42:12.000
Only this guy right here.

42:15.920 --> 42:18.280
- Well, champagne.
- So, champagne.

42:23.960 --> 42:28.640
I cannot tell you how much I appreciate
what you all have done

42:30.320 --> 42:34.640
and how long you have fought
and stayed by my side, so...

42:35.720 --> 42:38.280
- To you! Thank you.
-

42:38.560 --> 42:40.400
Thank you, my love. Thank you.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.160
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.240
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.320
And then a second toast
to the family:

42:46.400 --> 42:48.600
Margaret, Martha, Clay, everybody else.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.840
You guys just took this so well.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.400
You were in there.
You were suffering,

42:53.480 --> 42:56.600
but there’s a lot of emotional anguish
and mental anguish that we have too.

42:57.120 --> 43:00.840
And you guys were just incredible,
your emotional spirits,

43:01.160 --> 43:02.880
they never wavered, so cheers...

43:02.960 --> 43:04.880
- to you guys.
- La familia!

43:04.960 --> 43:07.080
- La familia!
-

43:07.160 --> 43:08.880
Hear, hear. Santé.

43:08.960 --> 43:09.880
Ching, ching!

43:10.000 --> 43:12.440
- Santé.
- Santé, santé.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.520
I can’t share my experience
for the last eight years

43:47.160 --> 43:48.360
with anybody.

43:48.480 --> 43:51.240
They wouldn’t understand it.
They have no way of knowing

43:51.560 --> 43:53.760
what that means.
I could say, "Well,

43:53.960 --> 43:56.840
I was locked away for eight years
and I didn’t have any privacy

43:56.920 --> 43:59.560
or any freedom.
I was in prison for eight years."

43:59.720 --> 44:03.000
People could say, "You were in prison for
eight years, it must have been terrible!"

44:03.240 --> 44:05.720
And you think, "Yeah it was."

44:05.800 --> 44:10.560
But you have
no real understanding of that.

44:10.680 --> 44:13.000
And I can’t tell you that.

44:13.080 --> 44:16.400
No matter what I tell you
can make you understand and realize that.

44:16.480 --> 44:21.360
And so, therefore you just...
your world is very different

44:21.680 --> 44:23.520
from everybody else’s world.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.120
I wanted to come back to who I was.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.360
But I can't.

44:29.800 --> 44:34.120
So, I’m still working about me

44:34.480 --> 44:37.240
in this world out there.

44:37.520 --> 44:41.840
Then with the realization also,
"Oh, don’t ever forget, Mike,

44:41.920 --> 44:43.760
they're trying to send you back there.

44:43.840 --> 44:47.600
They still think that you’re guilty,
many of them.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.840
They want you go to back there
for the rest of your life.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.400
They want you to die in prison."

44:51.480 --> 44:55.480
So, while you’re trying to move along,

44:55.560 --> 44:57.720
always on your shoulder is this...

44:59.560 --> 45:02.840
heavy burden.
Or, in my case, on my foot,

45:02.960 --> 45:05.240
the monitoring device.

45:05.520 --> 45:07.160
- David!
- How are you, sir?

45:07.240 --> 45:09.320
Good. Fine, fine. I'm fine.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.040
Have you shrunk a little?

45:11.120 --> 45:13.880
I’m still taller than you are.
I don’t care how damn much I’ve shrank!

45:16.160 --> 45:17.520
You look better than
the last time.

45:17.600 --> 45:20.880
Well, shit! If I was worse,
I’d be up there in Maplewood!

45:21.280 --> 45:24.680
Nothing much is gonna happen
in your case, no matter what,

45:25.200 --> 45:27.200
for the rest of this year.

45:27.720 --> 45:29.640
Um, after that,

45:29.760 --> 45:33.960
depending on what
the Attorney General’s office decides,

45:34.040 --> 45:36.080
what the Court of Appeals decides,

45:36.160 --> 45:37.720
- we could be back in...
- Right.

45:37.800 --> 45:41.080
putting it on the docket for trial
sometime next year.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.520
And then of course, the question becomes,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.120
do you want to retry this case,

45:47.400 --> 45:52.040
or do you want to see
if some sort of a resolution

45:52.120 --> 45:55.600
can be negotiated, and there’s
lots of different ways to do that.

45:55.680 --> 45:58.640
So, there’s a no-contest plea,
where you simply are

45:58.720 --> 46:00.840
saying, "I’m not gonna contest this."

46:00.920 --> 46:04.200
There’s an Alford plea,
where you basically say,

46:04.280 --> 46:06.200
"I’m pleading guilty,

46:06.280 --> 46:08.840
but I’m not pleading guilty
because I’m guilty.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.840
I’m pleading guilty because I don’t want
to go through another trial."

46:11.920 --> 46:13.920
I know guys in prison
who have taken an Alford Plea

46:14.000 --> 46:16.560
and said, basically,

46:16.640 --> 46:18.560
"Fuck it. I don’t want to go on
any further."

46:18.640 --> 46:20.760
- Yeah.
- "Just end this damn thing right now."

46:20.840 --> 46:23.080
But what that means is you’re guilty.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.240
- I mean, on the record...
- On the record.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.400
- you're guilty.
- On the record you're guilty.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.640
- I’m not guilty.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.400
I don’t care about any money,
I don’t care... whatever.

46:31.480 --> 46:33.800
I mean, I’m gonna go along
with what you say on this.

46:33.880 --> 46:36.120
Could the DA decide

46:36.200 --> 46:38.360
that he’s just gonna drop it?
He could...

46:38.440 --> 46:40.640
but I don’t think he’s gonna do that.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.640
So...

46:41.960 --> 46:44.400
realistically speaking,
the only three options

46:44.480 --> 46:48.200
are a No Contest Plea,
an Alford Plea, or go to trial.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.320
Even going to trial
doesn’t guarantee innocence.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.080
No, I understand,
but it gives me an option.

46:52.160 --> 46:54.160
The other two, there’s no option.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.840
You’re basically guilty.

46:55.920 --> 46:59.520
And you see, the whole thing is, I didn't
do it, so why would I even do this?

46:59.600 --> 47:00.920
- Right.
- Uh...

47:01.240 --> 47:04.960
- But...
- I think, we don’t need to discuss that

47:05.520 --> 47:07.160
today. I mean...

47:07.240 --> 47:08.600
But nothing's going to be until...

47:08.720 --> 47:10.680
- Oh, it's gonna be...
- ...maybe in the middle of next year.

47:10.760 --> 47:12.680
- At least.
- At least?

47:12.760 --> 47:14.240
Nothing’s gonna happen quickly here.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.520
Jesus. Okay. Alright.

47:40.640 --> 47:43.840
I can remember,
oh, when I was a very young man,

47:43.920 --> 47:48.280
I thought, "I’m going to live a life
with as few regrets as possible."

47:48.800 --> 47:51.920
And now I’m getting to be
a pretty old man.

47:52.280 --> 47:55.920
And I look back and,
oh, Lord, there are some regrets.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.400
"Oh, I wish that...
I wish I had done that differently.

47:58.480 --> 48:02.400
I wish I hadn’t done that. I wish..."
Yes, it’s filled with regrets,

48:03.080 --> 48:09.600
but in the balance I’ve got these
wonderful children.

48:10.560 --> 48:13.480
I had a wonderful relationship
with Kathleen.

48:13.560 --> 48:16.240
I was loved and I loved.

48:17.240 --> 48:19.720
And I still do. And I guess...

48:20.560 --> 48:23.000
that’s about the best you can say
about a person.

48:24.880 --> 48:28.000
Their capacity to love, and mine is...

48:28.160 --> 48:29.160
is infinite.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.200
Honestly, it gets bigger all the time.

48:32.720 --> 48:35.360
And I can look at my children and think,

48:35.680 --> 48:37.480
"Yeah, they love me."

48:39.280 --> 48:40.640
What else do you want?

50:02.400 --> 50:03.600
Did you plant the roses?

50:03.680 --> 50:06.040
No, I didn’t. No. No, no.

50:08.360 --> 50:09.280
Ow.

50:11.040 --> 50:12.200
I can get this one.

50:12.280 --> 50:13.240
Okay.

50:13.640 --> 50:14.480
Here.

50:36.960 --> 50:38.240
Hm.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.480
Ten years later.

50:53.040 --> 50:53.880
I know.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.960
Still hurts.

50:59.400 --> 51:01.400
It’ll always hurt. It’ll never go away.

51:02.080 --> 51:04.440
Ever. None of it ever goes away.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.320
You never forget it.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.400
Always pain, always pain.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.240
Come on, dear, let’s go.
