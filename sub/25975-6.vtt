00:17.760 --> 00:19.751
[radio stations changing]

00:24.770 --> 00:28.513
[Junior Walker &amp; The All Stars' "Shotgun"
playing on radio]

00:28.610 --> 00:30.396
[Buddy laughing]

00:30.480 --> 00:33.938
Oh, man. Now this takes me way back.

00:41.700 --> 00:45.579
Hey, what? You're choking the lifeout
of the steering wheel.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.832
Come on. We got the job done.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.126
Let's enjoy it.

00:54.130 --> 00:55.540
[coughing]

00:57.470 --> 00:59.347
[clears throat] Ow!

00:59.430 --> 01:00.886
-You okay?
-[grunts]

01:01.510 --> 01:02.511
Yeah.

01:03.270 --> 01:04.919
-Buddy, you all right?
-[coughs]

01:06.190 --> 01:07.680
You sure you're okay?

01:07.770 --> 01:08.850
[grunts]

01:09.310 --> 01:10.311
Never better.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.607
Whoa! [chuckling]

01:17.200 --> 01:18.349
You know, I...

01:20.580 --> 01:22.400
I saw these guys

01:22.490 --> 01:28.827
at the Fox Theater, in Detroit, in '65.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.160
[both chuckle]

01:32.050 --> 01:35.122
-God damn, that was some show.
-Hmm.

01:35.920 --> 01:36.921
[exhales]

01:37.010 --> 01:40.138
Do you miss it? Your life back in Detroit?

01:41.100 --> 01:43.170
-[Buddy grunts] Sometimes.
-Hmm.

01:43.810 --> 01:47.473
You know, that city was in its prime.

01:48.770 --> 01:52.809
It was vibrant. And it really had soul.

01:52.900 --> 01:53.935
[Wendy] Hmm.

01:55.820 --> 01:57.526
Yeah, I always thought I...

01:58.530 --> 02:00.361
I'd make my way back.

02:04.790 --> 02:05.779
[Buddy] Yeah.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.877
[exhales]

02:12.380 --> 02:13.699
Promise me,

02:14.880 --> 02:17.371
when you get that casino up and running,

02:18.760 --> 02:21.137
you're gonna get the hell out of here.

02:23.350 --> 02:24.556
Yes?

02:26.560 --> 02:27.879
We have a plan.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.561
There's a small town in Australia.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.897
It's about an hour's drive
from the Gold Coast.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.730
Mullumbimby.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.570
[laughs]

02:47.330 --> 02:48.319
[chuckles] What? Mullum what?

02:50.790 --> 02:51.996
[chuckling]

02:52.080 --> 02:54.412
-Mullumbimby.
-Don't make me laugh.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.297
[laughing]

02:56.380 --> 02:59.417
-Have you been there?
-No. Oh, God, no.

03:00.220 --> 03:01.790
No, I've only read about it.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.966
Growing up,
we didn't have any money to travel.

03:07.060 --> 03:08.596
I mean, we didn't have any money
to do anything,

03:08.680 --> 03:10.386
so I would go to the library.

03:11.310 --> 03:13.301
And I'd put my finger on the map.

03:15.110 --> 03:16.316
[chuckles]

03:17.190 --> 03:18.521
Well, what's it like?

03:19.900 --> 03:20.889
Remote.

03:21.740 --> 03:25.699
Lush. It's surrounded by mountains.
It's near the water.

03:25.780 --> 03:29.159
I mean, it's a lot like the Ozarks.
[laughs]

03:29.250 --> 03:31.070
Except people talk funny there.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.280
I told Marty about it.

03:35.790 --> 03:38.088
At first, it was the name that we liked.

03:40.590 --> 03:41.921
Gold Coast.

03:45.010 --> 03:49.265
And then I remembered this spot nearby,
kind of like a hideout.

03:49.770 --> 03:50.759
Of course, Marty,

03:50.850 --> 03:53.978
he's paranoid that there's gonna be
a tsunami that hits the coast.

03:54.060 --> 03:57.018
But, you know,
I figure the town is so far inland,

03:57.110 --> 04:00.147
I mean, we'll have beach-front property
by the time the water gets to us.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.777
[chuckles]

04:15.500 --> 04:16.489
Buddy. Buddy?

04:28.680 --> 04:29.920
[exclaims]

04:45.990 --> 04:47.526
[exhales]

05:02.210 --> 05:03.199
[knocking on door]

05:05.930 --> 05:06.999
Ruth?

05:09.300 --> 05:10.631
You okay in there?

05:14.140 --> 05:16.096
-Ruth?
-[knocking continues]

05:17.310 --> 05:18.720
[cell phone vibrating]

05:19.400 --> 05:21.436
-Ruth.
-[sniffles]

05:24.740 --> 05:25.729
[knock on door]

05:25.820 --> 05:26.696
What?

05:27.240 --> 05:30.698
[Wyatt] Uncle Cade told me what happened.
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

05:30.780 --> 05:34.989
I'm fine. Just stop being a stalker
and get your shit together for school.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.957
I'm not leaving until you come out.

05:44.130 --> 05:45.370
Suit yourself.

06:10.030 --> 06:10.985
[shudders]

06:17.460 --> 06:19.576
[sobbing]

06:56.620 --> 06:59.202
Buddy told me he wanted to die
at home in his bed.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.661
Do you think he'd be upset
that he died in his car?

07:02.750 --> 07:05.287
No, sweetheart, I don't think
he'd be upset about that.

07:13.470 --> 07:15.381
What were you guys doing out so late?

07:17.310 --> 07:19.471
And why did he smell like gasoline?

07:22.230 --> 07:24.642
Well, Buddy wanted to help us
with something,

07:24.730 --> 07:28.518
_ _ but it was... _
It was Just too much for hIm.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.179
Help us with what?

07:31.200 --> 07:32.986
Why did you let him go with you?

07:35.870 --> 07:37.326
I thought he was better.

07:41.120 --> 07:46.160
It's nobody's fault, Jonah, okay?
Buddy was sick. This was his time.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.040
-All set.
-Yeah.

07:49.130 --> 07:51.121
Thank you, Harry.
Sorry for the short notice.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.335
[Harry sighs] That's life.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.460
Sorry again for your loss.

07:59.180 --> 08:01.262
Why don't we all stay at home today?

08:02.060 --> 08:04.972
Just the four of us? We can...
We can make pancakes.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.357
You okay, Charlotte?
Does that sound like a good idea?

08:08.690 --> 08:11.067
[sighs] I just feel so stupid.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.732
I know that this was coming,
but it just doesn't make...

08:14.490 --> 08:15.650
[Marty] I know.

08:17.870 --> 08:20.111
-I know.
-[Charlotte exhales]

08:20.200 --> 08:21.246
Go help Jonah.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.785
Um...

08:27.960 --> 08:29.700
I'm gonna go try to get in front of this.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.461
At least take the morning.

08:34.840 --> 08:38.253
You blew up their ﬁeld, Wendy.
It's just gonna get worse from here.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.596
Try to stay off the phone.
The feds might be listening.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.180
[chattering]

08:58.950 --> 09:02.158
Any of those dogs
so much as pisses in that barn,

09:02.250 --> 09:03.569
you'll be hearing from our lawyer.

09:03.660 --> 09:05.912
What exactly do you expect to turn up?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.661
His name is Camino Del Rio.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.706
Ring any bells?

09:14.720 --> 09:15.926
He a Mexican?

09:16.510 --> 09:18.922
[Petty] Last he was seen,
he was headed on to your property.

09:21.390 --> 09:24.052
Well, anything you can tell me
about the fire out here last night?

09:24.930 --> 09:28.093
That was a prescribed burn
on one of our fields.

09:28.190 --> 09:30.567
-[Petty] A prescribed burn?
-Mm-hmm.

09:30.650 --> 09:32.527
If you farmed, you'd know.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.185
In the middle of the night?

09:36.320 --> 09:37.856
Because I think you're hiding something.

09:37.950 --> 09:40.236
I think you're trying
to destroy evidence out here.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.571
Evidence of what?

09:42.990 --> 09:44.366
I guess we'll see.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.587
-You okay?
-Stil| walking on two feet, ain't I?

09:58.130 --> 10:01.008
You're late.
And if I find out you're skipping class,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.306
I will hunt you down,

10:02.390 --> 10:05.268
tie you to the back of the beast
and drag you there myself.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.807
Go get Three and get in the damn car.

10:09.020 --> 10:09.896
Go!

10:11.860 --> 10:13.009
Where are you heading?

10:14.440 --> 10:15.350
Work.

10:16.690 --> 10:17.941
Here. Let me see.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.320
Good girl.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.197
Now, you know better than
to let those fuckers get you down.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.366
You play that long game.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.326
You strike back when they least expect it.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.542
We'll get that money, one way or another.

10:48.310 --> 10:49.129
[dogs barking]

10:49.230 --> 10:50.845
-[man] Get over here.
-[woman] There you go.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.786
[cell phone ringing]

11:10.670 --> 11:11.864
Petty.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.700
Copy that.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.301
Can I help you with something?

11:31.560 --> 11:35.519
-Just here to see my business partners.
-And what business is that exactly?

11:36.150 --> 11:38.220
We have a bid for a casino.

11:38.730 --> 11:39.776
Right.

11:39.860 --> 11:43.853
Well, I'm afraid I can't allow you
to have any contact with your partners,

11:43.950 --> 11:47.784
because anything we turn up today could
persuade them to testify against you.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.402
Any contact you have with them
could compromise that.

11:53.370 --> 11:54.997
So, I'm sure you understand.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.296
He's gonna back up.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.659
Asshole.

12:01.340 --> 12:02.250
Pnck.

12:08.850 --> 12:12.172
[man] Simmer down. Simmer down! Good boy.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.317
[sniffs]

12:20.280 --> 12:22.441
Hey! I think we got something.

12:53.390 --> 12:54.880
[Wendy]
Do we know what’s on the warrant?

12:55.560 --> 12:56.720
No, we don't.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.892
It's weird, you know.
Petty didn't actually tell me.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.777
Well, it's a good thing
that we burned that field, at least.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.488
It's not. It's not so good
that you didn't run it by me.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.060
When were we supposed
to talk about it, Marty? Hmm?

13:08.160 --> 13:11.072
When Ruth was being tortured by the cartel
and you were tied up on the ground?

13:11.160 --> 13:13.037
It's not like I stole your credit card
and I bought a dress.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.326
You made the right call. It's just...

13:14.410 --> 13:17.072
we gotta stay on the same page always,
or things fall apart.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.873
You know, you got a real way
of complimenting me

13:20.960 --> 13:23.508
and walking it back in the same breath.
You know that?

13:23.590 --> 13:24.750
Tell me they cleaned out the barn.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.468
Tell me that the feds are not about
to find a herom processmg...

13:28.090 --> 13:29.170
Hey there, Harry.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.591
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

13:31.680 --> 13:32.556
No, you're not. No.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.767
This one comes in gray or pink granite.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.010
-It's modern, but timeless.
-Mm-hmm.

13:42.110 --> 13:44.237
You're thinking single occupancy
or double?

13:44.320 --> 13:46.732
[Wendy] Oh, double.
Let's give him some room in there.

13:47.990 --> 13:50.276
-We're getting Buddy a mausoleum?
-Mm-hmm.

13:50.370 --> 13:52.577
-When were you gonna tell me about that?
-I'm telling you now.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.451
[Harry] How do we feel about statues?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.204
I've been texting.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.915
[Wendy] I've been away from my phone.

17:36.010 --> 17:39.594
-It's important.
-I've had something more important.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.131
FBI wants to question me.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.427
An Agent Petty. I'm guessing you know him.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.341
I need to know
what I'm involved with here.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.396
I think you know exactly
what you're involved in.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.356
Do I?

17:51.940 --> 17:53.521
If we're gonna have
any kind of relationship,

17:53.610 --> 17:55.987
you need to start being 100% honest
with me.

17:56.570 --> 17:58.526
The casino deal is completely legal.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.908
But the business your investors
are involved in isn't.

18:04.870 --> 18:05.780
No.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.786
Did you know this
before you started working with them?

18:14.090 --> 18:15.205
Yes.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.297
Well, don't stop now, Charles. Let's go.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.041
You want the whole truth,
now's your chance.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.016
Shit. Fuck.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.230
Hi.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.195
Hi.

18:40.660 --> 18:44.369
I didn't, uh... I didn't know
if you'd be in today.

18:44.450 --> 18:45.610
[chuckles softly]

18:46.500 --> 18:49.867
You think those poles
wipe themselves off? [sniffs]

18:52.040 --> 18:55.248
No, I mean...
You know, you weren't answering my calls.

18:55.340 --> 19:01.256
And, you know, I just figured that I would
make the rounds myself until you got back.

19:02.640 --> 19:06.462
Mmm, just throw it in the safe.
I'll deal with it later.

19:06.970 --> 19:10.758
You know, Ruth, if you need more time,
you take all that you need. I can--

19:10.850 --> 19:12.511
I'm fucking fine, Marty.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.566
Okay? Just...

19:15.480 --> 19:18.779
Just put it in the safe!
I got other shit I have to deal with.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.536
[chattering]

20:02.820 --> 20:05.232
-Call my lavwer.
-I already did.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.400
I want to hear you say it.

20:10.580 --> 20:11.786
Say what?

20:11.870 --> 20:14.828
That we should never have gotten involved
with these people.

20:16.540 --> 20:20.795
Whose idea was it to put the bones
into the poppy field? Ash's?

20:21.880 --> 20:26.044
If I was you, I don't think Ash would be
the topic to be talking about right now.

20:26.140 --> 20:27.255
[Petty] Excuse me.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.056
Here's where I ask
if you'd like to discuss

20:30.140 --> 20:32.222
all your business dealings
with Marty Byrde.

20:32.310 --> 20:34.722
[Jacob] I ain't gonna discuss anything
without a lawyer.

20:34.810 --> 20:36.641
Oh. Well, in that case,
I'm required by law

20:36.730 --> 20:38.766
to tell you that you have the right
to remain silent.

20:38.860 --> 20:42.102
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

20:42.190 --> 20:46.866
The mere existence _of bones_ in a field
does not constitute a crime.

20:46.950 --> 20:48.986
Are you waiving your Miranda rights, hmm?

20:49.580 --> 20:50.729
Will the sheriff please note

20:50.830 --> 20:53.242
that Mr. Snell here is choosing
to waive his Miranda rights?

20:53.750 --> 20:54.785
We're gonna have to bring you in.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.160
On what charge?

20:57.250 --> 21:00.299
There's a county ordinance banning fires,
due to drought.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.007
You're a farmer. You know.

21:02.670 --> 21:03.910
Are you kidding me?

21:04.010 --> 21:05.796
[Petty] The good news is
I'm gonna get that all thrown out

21:05.880 --> 21:07.586
when I charge you for murder.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.044
Cuff him.

21:11.390 --> 21:12.766
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.

21:12.850 --> 21:13.805
I do.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.760
Cuff him.

21:37.210 --> 21:38.370
Let's go.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.666
Would someone please explain
to your business partner

21:45.760 --> 21:49.503
that we need to know exactly what it is
that the FBI is about to uncover.

21:49.590 --> 21:51.342
-Oh, do you now?
-Yes, we do.

21:51.430 --> 21:54.058
Darlene, is Del in that field?

21:54.140 --> 21:55.471
Del...

21:56.770 --> 21:58.476
Del is located elsewhere.

21:59.190 --> 22:00.555
Okay, good.

22:00.650 --> 22:05.349
Uh, and the other missing persons,
are they gonna cause us any problems?

22:05.440 --> 22:06.441
I can't rightly say.

22:06.530 --> 22:08.270
[Helen] In case this is somehow unclear,

22:08.360 --> 22:12.148
targets of murder investigations
are not granted casino licenses.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.903
I don't give a damn
about any casino license.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.149
[Helen] I'll rephrase that.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.491
Your husband might go away
for mass murder.

22:19.580 --> 22:21.070
What do you plan to do about it?

22:21.170 --> 22:24.662
Seems to me
that the people who burnt our field

22:24.760 --> 22:27.160
are the ones who have to come up
with some kind of solution.

22:27.260 --> 22:28.545
But we didn't burn your field.

22:28.630 --> 22:31.508
-[Darlene] You're a goddamn liar.
-I burned the field.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.215
And it's a good thing, too.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.097
Otherwise, both you and Jacob
would be in jail for drug trafficking.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.561
You stood in my home

22:46.610 --> 22:49.647
and talked about adoption agencies.

22:50.860 --> 22:52.521
You lied to me.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.782
I saved this entire enterprise
from going under.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.457
[Marty] Darlene, they found bones
on your property.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.030
We need to find out who they belong to,

23:01.120 --> 23:03.588
and we need to figure out
what to do about it.

23:06.590 --> 23:10.799
You need to get my husband out
of fucking jail.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.310
[machine whirring]

23:32.410 --> 23:33.695
[clears throat]

23:42.210 --> 23:45.031
Pastor, I thought that was you.
What brings you in here?

23:45.130 --> 23:48.588
Uh, on the TV, they said they found bones
on the Snells' property. Is that true?

23:48.670 --> 23:50.251
Yeah. There was a search warrant
executed yesterday.

23:50.340 --> 23:51.216
Is it Grace?

23:51.300 --> 23:52.927
We don't know anything yet.

23:53.510 --> 23:55.671
I told you that they're the ones
that killed her.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.888
Well, we don't want to jump
to any conclusions.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.973
They're in the initial stages
of identifying the remains,

24:02.060 --> 24:04.597
-checking the DNA against missing persons.
-Okay.

24:05.110 --> 24:08.523
But, you know,
I'm afraid Grace isn't in the database.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.351
Um, what ifI bring my boy in?

24:12.450 --> 24:15.738
And you can sample his DNA for Grace.
You can do that, right?

24:16.660 --> 24:19.732
[stammers] Medical examiner's
not gonna be in the office

24:19.830 --> 24:22.993
till the day after tomorrow,
but, yeah, you could bring him back then.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.240
-Okay.
-All right.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.536
-Okay, thank you.
-Sure.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.425
Wendy, that was Darlene.

24:42.520 --> 24:46.763
Mason plans to bring his baby in
to get a sample of Grace's DNA.

24:48.940 --> 24:52.148
-Oh, Jesus. Is Grace in that grave?
-She wouldn't say.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.904
You don't really have a plan
for whatto do about those bones, do you?

24:57.620 --> 24:58.655
Do you?

24:59.450 --> 25:00.439
Uh, not yet.

25:03.370 --> 25:06.419
-I have to talk to Jacob.
-What good will that do?

25:06.500 --> 25:11.085
-Um, honestly, I don't know, but--
-Yeah. No, we have to warn him.

25:13.050 --> 25:15.257
-Who?
-Mason.

25:15.970 --> 25:17.289
You know what Darlene is capable of.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.506
There's no way in hell
she's gonna let him take her down.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.227
I'm right. You know I'm right.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.432
[Jim] I want it on record
that my client is here voluntarily,

25:32.980 --> 25:34.186
as a courtesy.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.107
[Petty clears throat] It's noted.

25:38.740 --> 25:40.696
Okay, let's see.

25:44.290 --> 25:47.612
Fifth largest private business owner
in the state.

25:49.580 --> 25:52.993
And you serve on the boards
of museums, universities.

25:53.090 --> 25:56.582
In the last year,
you donated over $2.3 million

25:56.680 --> 26:00.673
to Republican candidates
in local and state elections.

26:05.810 --> 26:09.769
Guess I understand
what the Byrdes see in you,

26:09.850 --> 26:12.762
but I'm having a hard time understanding
what you see in them.

26:12.860 --> 26:15.988
My client and the Byrdes
have no official business ties.

26:17.400 --> 26:22.690
Does a $50,000 donation to your charity
really buy that much goodwill?

26:23.410 --> 26:25.787
I have nothing but goodwill in this state.

26:26.290 --> 26:30.078
The idea that $50,000 somehow
buys my loyalty is ridiculous.

26:30.540 --> 26:33.748
[Petty] Okay, fine.
Let's just stick to the facts.

26:33.840 --> 26:39.085
Like, you're 18 days late
on a $136 million bank payment.

26:39.430 --> 26:40.920
My guess,

26:41.550 --> 26:44.849
if we were to look into your charity,
we'd see that you're siphoning funds

26:44.930 --> 26:47.478
to help prop up
your agricultural business.

26:48.690 --> 26:53.434
That's the real reason _ _
you need this casmo so badly, Isn't It?

26:54.520 --> 26:56.181
I'm not interested in your business.

26:57.150 --> 26:59.232
But I do know some people who would be.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.611
Unless I talk about Marty Byrde.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.815
Mm-hmm.

27:08.830 --> 27:11.162
Are you sure you want to be filming this?

27:13.670 --> 27:15.831
-I am.
-Fair enough.

27:16.420 --> 27:17.330
September.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.717
A man described
as looking very much like you

27:19.800 --> 27:23.634
fired a handgun inside a bar
called The Rusty Hull.

27:24.510 --> 27:29.516
Silly name if you ask me,
The Rusty Hull, but to each his own.

27:31.230 --> 27:34.939
That was, coincidentally,
the night before your motel room

27:35.020 --> 27:37.602
sustained over $10,000 worth of damage.

27:38.110 --> 27:39.429
Another funny thing,

27:39.530 --> 27:41.441
when I inquired about the shooting,

27:41.530 --> 27:45.318
a local drug dealer
became particularly interested.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.943
Turns out he was robbed and assaulted.

27:50.620 --> 27:54.078
Didn't report it. Drug dealer and all.

27:55.090 --> 27:58.628
It's amazing what you can find
if you look hard enough.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.621
I imagine at the moment
your bosses aren't particularly interested

28:02.720 --> 28:05.507
in looking hard at you at all.

28:06.970 --> 28:09.712
Though, I'm sure those things change.

28:21.990 --> 28:23.355
Quid pro quo.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.447
I tell you everything I know
about the Byrdes.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.820
[Petty] And what do you get?

28:29.330 --> 28:34.324
I'm free from investigation.
And Wendy Byrde gets protection.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.758
[Marty] Come on, God damn it.
Just tell me about the bods, okay?

28:49.350 --> 28:52.808
Who are they? Is one of the bodies Grace?

28:53.730 --> 28:55.971
Shouldn't ask questions you don't want
to know the answers to.

28:56.060 --> 28:57.766
You're old enough to know that.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.182
Are there other_ Masons out there
that are looking for answers?

29:01.280 --> 29:04.488
"Who knows what hath been buried,

29:05.490 --> 29:07.401
until the earth belches it up,

29:07.490 --> 29:12.325
and new eyes
are lain upon some old, dank deed."

29:13.460 --> 29:16.361
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
I'm just trying to get you out of here.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.121
Feds are just trying to screw me

29:18.210 --> 29:21.202
the same way they screwed my family
when they flooded us out.

29:23.590 --> 29:26.889
Five generations of Snells have lived
on that land.

29:27.890 --> 29:31.212
Their remains are scattered all over.

29:32.640 --> 29:36.224
You can't expect me to account
for every pile of bones that turns up.

29:40.900 --> 29:42.140
Say that again.

29:43.940 --> 29:44.895
No.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.279
It's a possible way out of here.
Tell me where your ancestors are buried.

29:50.780 --> 29:52.657
That is desecration.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.458
We do not disturb our dead.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.286
Then you're gonna rot in here.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.555
Mason.

30:15.850 --> 30:16.930
What are you doing here?

30:17.020 --> 30:20.683
[scoffs] He's beautiful. What's his name?

30:28.820 --> 30:30.731
I heard you came by to see Sheriff Nix.

30:30.820 --> 30:32.071
[Mason groans]

30:32.160 --> 30:34.731
-You people--
-I'm here because I'm worried about you,

30:34.830 --> 30:36.695
and I'm worried about your baby.

30:38.580 --> 30:41.037
You've never cared
about anyone but yourself ever.

30:42.790 --> 30:44.872
I am so sorry that Grace is gone.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.165
There is nothing we can do
to bring her back,

30:48.260 --> 30:50.000
but you can still help your son.

30:50.090 --> 30:51.717
Call the sheriff.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.928
Tell him you don't plan to bring
the baby in to test for Grace's DNA.

30:57.310 --> 31:00.268
-Why would I do that?
-Because you know the Snells.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.470
You know what they're capable of.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.647
They'll do anything they can
to stop that test.

31:09.780 --> 31:13.568
Grace would still be alive
if it wasn't for you and Marty.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.782
IfI hadn't invited you into my home,

31:17.870 --> 31:21.499
if you hadn't fed me lies
about your father

31:21.580 --> 31:24.834
helping build a church
and the depth of your faith.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.239
That wasn't a lie.

31:26.340 --> 31:28.456
You think coming here
is gonna absolve you?

31:29.550 --> 31:33.543
That blood is never washing off.
I'm gonna see to that.

31:35.350 --> 31:36.920
I want you to remember
what happened to you

31:40.020 --> 31:42.147
Please, I am begging you. Smarten up.

31:43.310 --> 31:46.859
Save yourself. Save your son.
Don't come back to the lake.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.781
[TV playing]

32:04.920 --> 32:06.080
[Ruth clears throat]

32:08.210 --> 32:09.507
You not working?

32:10.720 --> 32:12.210
I took the day off.

32:14.180 --> 32:17.889
-What's Marty gonna say about that?
-I don't know, and I don't care.

32:23.310 --> 32:25.358
Can I ask you for a favor?

32:26.610 --> 32:27.895
Yeah, of course.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.180
You know those pills you had?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.697
Can I have a couple?

32:35.200 --> 32:37.691
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

32:38.870 --> 32:40.189
I mean, it's just...

32:40.290 --> 32:43.532
You're coming in here, asking me for Ow.
I'm just wondering if--

32:43.620 --> 32:47.738
You know, I can go to Jimmy in town.
Ijust figured if you had...

32:47.840 --> 32:49.410
It's all right. I got you.

32:57.970 --> 33:00.518
This have anything to do
with why you're not at work?

33:03.060 --> 33:04.266
[sighs]

33:04.810 --> 33:10.476
You know that FBI guy Petty,
the one that raided Marty?

33:11.530 --> 33:13.430
_-Mm-hmm.
-He still comes In here?

33:15.030 --> 33:16.486
Sometimes.

33:17.450 --> 33:19.577
Well, stay the fuck away from him.

33:23.750 --> 33:25.035
Tell me what happened.

33:30.710 --> 33:33.452
He set me up to look like a rat.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.963
Did something fucking happen to you?
Is that what you're saying?

33:40.050 --> 33:42.177
Jesus, Ruth,
tell me what fucking happened.

33:58.990 --> 34:01.732
Who did that? Did he?

34:04.160 --> 34:06.071
All I'm just saying,

34:06.160 --> 34:09.618
if that fuckwad shows up here,
don't trust him.

34:10.130 --> 34:13.122
He'll use you up and spit you out.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.180
You fucking with me, nerdcore?

34:38.320 --> 34:42.768
-Um... no. I don't think so.
-Is this how you run a business?

34:42.870 --> 34:44.656
You take people's money and flake?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.115
Oh, crap.

34:49.580 --> 34:53.539
Look, I'm... so sorry.
We, uh, had a death in the family.

34:53.630 --> 34:54.995
What the fuck's that?

34:55.670 --> 34:57.297
It's your money back.

34:57.380 --> 34:59.336
I'm failing that class
because of you, dipshit.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.500
And I'll give you 50% discount
on the next one.

35:02.550 --> 35:03.460
That's fragile.

35:04.930 --> 35:06.010
[grunts]

35:06.890 --> 35:07.879
[Wyatt] Hey!

35:09.190 --> 35:11.556
-What the fuck, man?
-He's, like, half your size, bro.

35:11.650 --> 35:13.265
Just stay the fuck out of it, burnout.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.522
-[crowd gasping]
-[boy] Oh, yeah!

35:20.400 --> 35:21.560
[man] Hey, hey! Break it up.

35:49.020 --> 35:52.262
[cell phone beeps]

35:53.770 --> 35:55.010
This is Marty Byrde.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.272
[Charlotte]
50, they really suspended you?

35:58.990 --> 35:59.979
For a week.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.986
They said it was a violation
of the honor code.

36:04.490 --> 36:05.650
What about Wyatt?

36:06.160 --> 36:07.479
He's still in there.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.458
You two, let's go.
We can talk about this at home.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.622
-Hi.
-I'm gonna stay and talk to Wyatt.

36:15.710 --> 36:18.201
Talk to him later. We got a lot of stuff
on our plate. Come on.

36:18.750 --> 36:22.004
He saved Jonah from getting beat up.
That kid was huge.

36:22.090 --> 36:23.125
[Marty] Yeah, that's another thing.

36:23.220 --> 36:25.006
You're doing homework
for tenth graders, huh?

36:25.090 --> 36:27.718
-What did they say?
-They expelled me.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.768
[Charlotte] What? They can't do that.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.557
It's 'cause of the zero-tolerance policy
against fighting.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.221
You were protecting Jonah.

36:35.310 --> 36:37.642
I'm gonna go the fuck in there
and talk to them.

36:37.730 --> 36:39.561
Please, Ruth, not now.

36:39.650 --> 36:43.142
If you get kicked out, that means
no Mizzou. You know that, right?

36:43.240 --> 36:46.698
-I know. Please, can you just let it be?
-Dad, you have to fix this.

36:46.780 --> 36:48.190
I don't make the rules. Come on.

36:48.280 --> 36:52.205
What? Oh, the rules about the one
suspending your kid for cheating,

36:52.290 --> 36:55.669
but kick out Wyatt for saving his ass
from being stomped on?

36:56.830 --> 36:58.161
What am I supposed to do?

36:58.750 --> 36:59.910
I don't know, Marty.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.333
I guess there's nothing
you ever can do, is there?

37:04.880 --> 37:05.790
Come on.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.597
-Stay the fuck away from Wyatt.
-[Wyatt] Ruth.

37:14.640 --> 37:18.303
-She's a bad goddamn influence, Marty.
-Ruth, stop!

37:23.280 --> 37:25.657
[Ma/1y]
I don ’t understand.
If you needed money, you could just ask.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.156
-I know.
-Then why did you do it?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.911
Uh-oh. You got something you wanna add?

37:41.880 --> 37:44.462
I didn't steal five thousand, I stole ten.

37:45.470 --> 37:46.835
And we split it.

37:47.340 --> 37:48.921
Before you yell at me about honesty,

37:49.010 --> 37:52.468
look me in the eye and tell me that
you've never lied to us about anything.

37:55.310 --> 37:56.800
You would have done the same thing.

37:59.270 --> 38:01.226
Hey, what'd you do with your money?

38:01.820 --> 38:02.639
Jonah?

38:04.990 --> 38:05.888
I cleaned it.

38:07.820 --> 38:08.855
[Wendy] You what?

38:09.700 --> 38:12.237
-You don't have a bank account.
-Yeah, well...

38:13.410 --> 38:14.616
I sort of do.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.950
This says Mike Fleming. Who's that?

38:25.050 --> 38:27.086
-[chuckling]
-Who's Mike Fleming? It's the name on the passport you got me.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.715
I used it to open a bank account,

38:33.430 --> 38:34.966
along with two offshore accounts...

38:35.560 --> 38:37.175
one in Panama, another in Cyprus.

38:38.690 --> 38:41.261
They're numbered, just like you taught me.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.810
Every time I got paid for doing homework,

38:43.900 --> 38:47.779
I'd generate an invoice and mix in some
of the dirty money with the clean.

38:47.860 --> 38:49.566
[Wendy]
Okay, go to your rooms, both of you, now.

38:54.330 --> 38:56.321
Uh, listen, before you get...

38:56.410 --> 38:57.900
-We don't need to make a big deal of this.
-Oh, yeah?

38:58.000 --> 38:58.864
-No.
-Yeah?

39:01.540 --> 39:05.624
Charlotte is stealing drug cartel cash
and telling secrets to Wyatt Langmore,

39:05.710 --> 39:07.507
who, incidentally,
thinks that you killed his dad.

39:07.590 --> 39:08.830
So, you know, I think, even for us,

39:08.920 --> 39:10.672
we need to make
a big fucking deal about this.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.170
I don't need a recap, either, okay?

39:12.260 --> 39:14.672
[stammering] This is just a moment,
and we're gonna get out of it.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.591
We need six months,
and then we're free, Wendy.

39:18.060 --> 39:20.972
-You're lying to yourself.
-How so?

39:21.480 --> 39:24.438
And every time you say it out loud,
I decide to believe you,

39:24.520 --> 39:27.182
because it sounds so much better
than what's actually gomg on here.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.565
It is what's really going on.

39:28.650 --> 39:30.311
Oh, stop. Just stop it.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.903
Well, what would you like to do, Wendy?
You want to send 'em out of here?

39:32.990 --> 39:35.868
No, we tried that already.
It didn't work.

39:35.950 --> 39:37.998
Yeah, because you let them
talk you into coming back.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.162
Is that what you wish?
That we didn't come back?

39:41.250 --> 39:44.742
-No, that's not what I said.
-Then we need to be here for them.

39:45.630 --> 39:48.201
What does that mean? Was that for me?

39:48.800 --> 39:51.212
Marty, you can't sit in this house
for more than 15 minutes

39:51.300 --> 39:52.426
without being distracted.

39:52.510 --> 39:55.718
-Okay, that's enough.
-No, what, the deposits, the meetings...

39:55.810 --> 39:58.347
-You're hiding from me and the kids...
-I'm busy.

39:58.850 --> 40:00.761
I'm not going back to that life.

40:00.850 --> 40:03.307
I mean, do you want to know why
Jonah is laundering money?

40:03.400 --> 40:05.391
Because he wants to prove to you
that he's useful,

40:05.480 --> 40:07.107
so that you have to
pay some attention to him.

40:07.190 --> 40:08.600
[scoffs] Jesus Christ.

40:09.190 --> 40:12.853
What? What? Where are you going?

40:14.240 --> 40:15.696
You want me to deal with things?
This is what it looks like.

40:15.780 --> 40:17.111
This is me dealing with things.
I gotta go.

40:17.200 --> 40:20.328
-Great. Of course you do. [scoffs]
-I don't know what you want from me.

40:20.410 --> 40:23.163
This is our life now. I can stay here.
I can talk about our feelings.

40:23.250 --> 40:27.038
Or I can go take care of shit
and make sure that we don't die, okay?

40:36.390 --> 40:37.675
[Marty grunting]

40:38.350 --> 40:41.422
[Darlene] I hope you understand
what you've asked of us.

40:42.890 --> 40:44.391
[Marty] I'm saving your husband.

40:45.730 --> 40:48.688
[Darlene] Because you think
what's dead is dead. Is that it?

40:49.440 --> 40:51.988
[Marty panting]

40:52.070 --> 40:54.402
This ground is fucking half-frozen.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.189
[thuds]

41:13.380 --> 41:14.790
[cell phone vibrating]

41:22.430 --> 41:23.385
Hey.

41:23.890 --> 41:25.130
[l/l/l7/(esj
You //ed to me.

41:25.730 --> 41:27.686
Look, it's not a good time, Charles.

41:28.610 --> 41:30.396
I need to talk to you.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.812
Marty’s not home.
I can ’t leave the kids a/one.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.197
I'm on your dock.

41:57.970 --> 42:00.291
Don't act like you're some kind of hero.

42:00.390 --> 42:04.724
We both know I could've taken care
of our preacher problem.

42:09.900 --> 42:11.936
[VI/likes]
You told me the relationship
with your investors
started a year ago in Chicago...

42:14.900 --> 42:16.310
that you got involved with them

42:16.400 --> 42:19.779
when you were soliciting money
for a business venture.

42:21.580 --> 42:24.367
Marty's been working for them
for over ten years.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.998
You're not just involved with the cartel.
You are the cartel.

42:28.080 --> 42:31.493
-What did you tell the FBI?
-What does it matter? It was all lies.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.205
I needed to know what you'd feed them.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.588
-You think this is some kind of game?
-Trust me. I know it's not.

42:36.670 --> 42:37.671
Ah...

42:38.550 --> 42:41.508
-I was trying to protect you.
-I don't need your protection.

42:42.300 --> 42:46.179
Wendy, for a smart woman,
you are so, so wrong.

42:46.850 --> 42:49.899
I have seen people shift money
from account to account,

42:49.980 --> 42:53.188
trying to keep hustling fast enough that
the whole thing somehow stays together.

42:53.270 --> 42:55.477
It's not sustainable.

42:56.690 --> 42:59.944
If what you say is true, there's nothing
you can do for me anyway.

43:01.950 --> 43:03.326
What if there was?

43:06.700 --> 43:07.746
Leave Marty.

43:09.870 --> 43:13.328
-So you can be my knight in shining armor?
-No, this isn't about me.

43:13.420 --> 43:14.489
You need to get out.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.009
You do that, I'll push the casino through.

43:19.090 --> 43:23.254
And then Marty will be able to try to keep
this insanity alive for as long as he can.

43:29.100 --> 43:30.340
You should go.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.850
[Wilkes sighs]

43:45.280 --> 43:46.406
[knocking on door]

43:49.500 --> 43:51.240
What happened to Ruth Langmore?

43:54.340 --> 43:56.376
You don't just show up here
without any warning.

43:56.460 --> 43:59.042
This isn't a partnership.
I don't talk about my work with you.

43:59.130 --> 44:02.759
She has bruises up and down her arms.
Did you do that to her?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.967
Ruth Langmore is a petty thief helping

44:05.050 --> 44:07.507
to launder money
for a Mexican drug cartel.

44:07.600 --> 44:10.342
So it's a miracle she's not gutted
in a ditch somewhere.

44:15.020 --> 44:16.567
I want to talk to your boss.

44:17.070 --> 44:20.062
I want it in writing that I get
a plea deal when this is over.

44:20.150 --> 44:21.856
There is no written agreement.

44:21.950 --> 44:25.818
Besides, no one knows who you are,
and that's for your own safety.

44:25.910 --> 44:28.481
You only get a plea deal
when you deliver something useful.

44:28.580 --> 44:32.209
-I got you a search warrant.
-Yeah, which so far is doing nothing.

44:32.290 --> 44:34.167
Well, that's not my fucking problem.

44:34.250 --> 44:36.741
Maybe if you hadn't outed me
to Marty Byrde...

44:36.840 --> 44:38.660
Maybe if you hadn't forced my hand...

44:38.750 --> 44:40.251
Maybe if you could hold
a fucking conversation with him

44:40.340 --> 44:41.159
without being loaded...

44:41.260 --> 44:44.218
I did everything I was supposed to do.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.427
-You can't keep doing this to me.
-"To you"?

44:47.850 --> 44:49.670
Doing this to you?

44:51.310 --> 44:56.179
Christ, why is it that criminals
are always so indignant?

44:56.270 --> 44:58.761
-I'm not a criminal.
-Yeah?

44:59.270 --> 45:01.898
Then why are you in this mess, huh?

45:02.490 --> 45:07.154
Why are you standing here,
in some strange gay guy's $40 motel room,

45:07.240 --> 45:11.404
whining like a grade school brat
who just flunked her test

45:11.500 --> 45:14.151
and swears it's everyone else's fault
but her own?

45:15.620 --> 45:17.372
[sighs]

45:19.380 --> 45:22.122
-I don't want any more drugs.
-Well, they're not for you.

45:22.510 --> 45:25.502
The next time Ruth comes
looking for drugs, give her these.

45:39.020 --> 45:41.011
[TV playing]

45:48.490 --> 45:50.947
Still chopping boats out
at Taylor's place?

45:52.330 --> 45:55.117
I thought you didn't wanna hear nothing
about that shit.

45:56.290 --> 45:58.702
You keep Wyatt and Three out of it.

45:58.790 --> 46:01.293
You do that,
and I'm in for whatever you need.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.611
That's the FBI, isn't it?

46:32.660 --> 46:33.729
Ignore them.

47:19.960 --> 47:22.372
What's Wilkes doing here?
He never met Buddy. I don't know.
Paying his respects, I guess.

47:26.300 --> 47:27.870
-Hey, Harry.
-Mr. Byrde.

47:30.090 --> 47:31.216
Mrs. Byrde.

47:31.890 --> 47:33.505
-Should we get started?
-Yeah, I think so.

47:59.620 --> 48:00.780
Who are they?

48:02.330 --> 48:03.740
Kansas City mob.

48:05.130 --> 48:06.290
[chuckles]

48:06.380 --> 48:07.916
Of course they are.

48:10.090 --> 48:12.001
Any news
from the medical examiner?

48:13.180 --> 48:14.499
[Ma/1y]
Not yet.

48:20.640 --> 48:22.551
We have a positive DNA match.

48:33.110 --> 48:37.194
Hi, I'm Jonah Byrde.
Did we speak over the phone?

48:37.280 --> 48:38.281
[Frank sighs]

48:39.160 --> 48:41.537
-You're Marty's boy?
-Yes, sir.

48:41.620 --> 48:42.575
[sighs]

48:43.330 --> 48:44.410
Frank Cosgrove.

48:45.130 --> 48:47.416
-I'm really glad you could make it.
-Me, too.

48:47.920 --> 48:48.830
Frank.

48:50.550 --> 48:53.508
Me and the boys wanted to come by
and pay our respects.

48:53.590 --> 48:54.420
Sure.

48:55.680 --> 48:57.921
And by the way,
hell of a kid you got here.

49:01.430 --> 49:02.886
I'm not sure I follow.

49:03.480 --> 49:08.929
I found a paper wheel in Buddy's room.
You know, with all his contacts on it.

49:09.020 --> 49:10.931
-You mean Jimmy.
-You mean a Rolodex.

49:11.030 --> 49:15.148
Yeah, so I contacted some of his friends
to tell them about the funeral.

49:15.660 --> 49:17.400
I hope that was okay.

49:17.490 --> 49:19.446
Yeah, no, good idea. Thank you. -A word?
-Yeah.

49:25.670 --> 49:26.819
Thank you, pal.

49:28.670 --> 49:31.548
Our people,
they're just standing around, Marty.

49:31.630 --> 49:33.757
We're gonna break ground
at the casino any day now.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.546
We got a couple of, uh...

49:35.630 --> 49:37.257
-Hitches.
-Yeah. Uh...

49:37.760 --> 49:41.764
No disrespect, but if there's any way
that we can delay paying them

49:41.850 --> 49:45.479
until after the work
actually gets done or started?

49:45.560 --> 49:46.470
Ah.

49:47.400 --> 49:48.549
[chuckles]

49:50.440 --> 49:51.850
In Jimmy's memory.

49:52.940 --> 49:54.316
I'll see what I can do. I appreciate it. Thank you.

49:57.700 --> 50:02.239
All five skeletons have about
a 1 to 12.5% match to Jacob Snell.

50:02.330 --> 50:04.901
Hmm? I don't understand.

50:06.460 --> 50:09.281
Isotope analysis showed
that the remains ranged

50:09.380 --> 50:11.792
from 90 to 150 years old.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.256
They're all related.

50:14.800 --> 50:17.621
Must have been
just an old family burial plot.

50:22.470 --> 50:25.132
Jesus wanted me to tell you
that just because you go to church,

50:25.230 --> 50:27.516
just because you dress
in your Sunday best,

50:27.600 --> 50:29.727
does not mean that he smiles down on you.

50:30.610 --> 50:33.898
Christ wants you to know also that
false piety is the greatest of all sins,

50:33.980 --> 50:36.392
because false piety is fakery.

50:37.400 --> 50:40.403
-In James 1:26--
-Excuse me.

50:40.870 --> 50:42.155
Do you have a permit to be out here?

50:44.950 --> 50:46.861
[stammers] A permit?

50:46.960 --> 50:50.532
Why would I need a permit
to exercise my freedom of speech

50:50.630 --> 50:53.121
on behalf of my Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ?

50:53.210 --> 50:54.416
-That what it is?
-Yes.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.161
Calling all these Christians fakers?

50:58.720 --> 51:00.335
[stutters]

51:00.430 --> 51:01.886
I'm not calling them all fakers.

51:02.470 --> 51:03.960
We received a child endangerment report

51:04.060 --> 51:07.348
about a preacher out here, with a baby,
in the cold,

51:07.430 --> 51:08.727
-seven, eight hours a day.
-[sighs] Now, I think that report's true.

51:11.560 --> 51:12.640
[Mason] No, don't touch him!

51:12.730 --> 51:14.061
Don't touch him!

51:14.940 --> 51:17.238
Oh, God. [panting]

51:17.320 --> 51:19.060
-No, no, no.
-Do not resist.

51:19.150 --> 51:20.026
No.

51:21.660 --> 51:23.901
Leave my son alone! [grunts]

51:25.160 --> 51:28.493
[Wendy]
When we ﬁrst met; I actually
didn ’t know what to make of Jimmy Small,

51:29.500 --> 51:30.706
whom we called Buddy.

51:31.790 --> 51:35.123
We were roommates, but we didn't get off
to a particularly smooth start.

51:35.210 --> 51:38.043
See, Buddy liked to skinny-dip.

51:38.130 --> 51:39.040
[crowd laughs]

51:41.220 --> 51:45.054
In fact, the first morning that my husband
and I woke up in the Ozarks, we...

51:45.970 --> 51:49.383
we looked out over the vastness
of the lake, and there was Buddy,

51:49.480 --> 51:52.347
buck naked, staring back at us.

51:54.190 --> 51:56.818
But we... we got to know him.

51:57.940 --> 51:59.066
And love him.

52:01.450 --> 52:02.815
[chuckles]

52:02.910 --> 52:04.400
He saved our family.

52:05.490 --> 52:08.653
In ways I can't explain,
he literally saved us.

52:10.410 --> 52:14.244
And he was the man who I wanted to
have a drink with at the end of a bad day.

52:15.790 --> 52:18.122
We weren't related, but he was family.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.331
We loved him, and we will miss him.

52:41.360 --> 52:43.442
Would anyone else like to speak?

52:48.290 --> 52:50.110
-[Jonah] I'd like to say a few things.
-Right.

53:02.470 --> 53:07.749
Hi, I'm Jonah Byrde,
and I lived with Jimmy.

53:10.310 --> 53:12.551
I reached out
to some of his friends this week.

53:12.640 --> 53:14.221
But, unfortunately,
a lot of them were dead.

53:14.310 --> 53:16.187
[crowd laughs]

53:17.560 --> 53:19.471
He didn't talk much about his past.

53:20.690 --> 53:25.309
But I found out that Jimmy was a war hero
and that he'd won a Purple Heart.

53:25.700 --> 53:27.691
Also, he was one of the best negotiators

53:27.780 --> 53:30.487
that the United Auto Workers,
up in Detroit, ever had.

53:30.580 --> 53:31.399
[whispering] I didn't know that.

53:31.490 --> 53:35.779
Anyway, a lot of people wanted me
to pass along messages to you.

53:36.750 --> 53:37.876
So, um...

53:39.040 --> 53:43.374
Gretchen from Pontiac said,
"Jimmy was the handsomest man I ever knew.

53:44.630 --> 53:47.588
I'm no home-wrecker, but I was a sucker
for those bright green eyes."

53:47.680 --> 53:50.308
[crowd chuckling]

53:50.390 --> 53:54.633
[Jonah] Pete from Flint told me,
"He was a real son of a bitch.

53:55.600 --> 53:58.649
And I mean that in the best way, kind of."

53:58.730 --> 53:59.890
Thanks, Pete.

54:00.940 --> 54:03.989
His friend Mike
from Tallahassee, Florida, said,

54:04.070 --> 54:07.028
"Jimmy was the best damn chopper pilot
in Vietnam."

54:08.660 --> 54:11.732
He also told me that Gretchen
was the love of Jimmy's life.

54:13.830 --> 54:15.616
So, I guess what I wanna say is...

54:17.670 --> 54:19.786
to me, Buddy was just Buddy.

54:23.130 --> 54:25.917
He was an old man,
but he knew how to talk to a kid.

54:29.640 --> 54:31.596
He knew how to tell you
what you need to know.

54:34.100 --> 54:36.477
He knew how to ask you things,
and he knew how to listen.

54:40.230 --> 54:41.970
Buddy was my best friend.

54:45.860 --> 54:49.899
In a way,
he's the only real friend I ever had.

54:54.740 --> 54:56.958
And I'll carry our secrets to my grave.

55:20.270 --> 55:23.819
We're dropping the charges,
calling it a misunderstanding.

55:23.900 --> 55:27.188
They can call it whatever they like.
I ain't gonna forget it.

55:28.450 --> 55:31.567
I missed you so, baby.

55:32.990 --> 55:37.529
-Half what I missed you, honey.
-[sighs] Oh! Let's go.

55:41.330 --> 55:42.376
Thank you.

55:43.340 --> 55:44.955
So, how'd you do it?

55:46.130 --> 55:48.166
Pardon me. Do what?

55:49.800 --> 55:51.336
Oh, come on.

55:52.550 --> 55:56.099
You know, when the power company
dammed up our land,

55:56.180 --> 55:59.843
our family's remains had to be moved out
of harm's way.

55:59.930 --> 56:04.185
So, I guess I should thank you
for helping us find them.

56:05.730 --> 56:08.437
[Darlene] That said,
you'll be hearing from our lawyer

56:08.530 --> 56:12.409
about the civil suit
we're bringing against the FBI

56:12.490 --> 56:14.151
for desecrating our graves.

56:24.460 --> 56:26.951
[chattering]

56:29.340 --> 56:32.969
Honestly, when I showed you Buddy's house,
I thought you'd never take it.

56:33.470 --> 56:37.463
And then you did, and I thought,
"Uh-oh! This isn't gonna work."

56:38.470 --> 56:41.348
-And then you became so close.
-[Wendy] Life's funny like that.

56:41.940 --> 56:45.103
Yeah, like me taking the job
at Lickety Splitz.

56:45.610 --> 56:48.852
If I hadn't done that,
I never would have met Jade.

56:48.940 --> 56:51.647
I mean, Melissa. [chuckles]

56:53.450 --> 56:55.611
No, you certainly wouldn't have.
[chuckles]

56:57.740 --> 56:59.867
-If you'll excuse me one minute.
-Yeah, sure.

57:04.040 --> 57:06.122
It's getting late.
We should get the kids home.

57:06.210 --> 57:07.086
[Marty] Yeah.

57:07.790 --> 57:10.258
I agree. Okay, um, I will...

57:10.340 --> 57:12.376
I'll finish up here, okay?

57:14.430 --> 57:15.419
See you at home.

57:21.220 --> 57:22.551
[door opens]

57:23.480 --> 57:24.515
[door closes]

58:42.220 --> 58:45.724
Don't worry about cleaning up anymore.
I'll finish it before I go.

58:47.100 --> 58:48.385
[Rachel] Well...

58:49.650 --> 58:53.609
I may not like you, but I'm not gonna
let you drink by yourself.

58:59.530 --> 59:01.191
[R&amp;B music playing on jukebox]

59:02.580 --> 59:03.979
Buddy would approve.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.286
[Rachel chuckles]

59:15.800 --> 59:17.586
Do you think I hide my emotions?

59:24.350 --> 59:28.059
I think you bury 'em in just about
the deepest grave I've ever seen.

59:33.820 --> 59:38.029
Oh, I know that it pisses off Wendy,
but I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

59:38.110 --> 59:41.694
You know, I'm trying to keep everything
from unraveling.

59:42.160 --> 59:45.652
And if I let myself get emotional...

59:49.370 --> 59:51.418
Maybe you could say exactly that.

59:52.210 --> 59:53.529
It's not that easy.

59:56.460 --> 59:57.700
Yeah, it is.

1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:02.580
You know, when Charlotte was born...

1:00:04.100 --> 1:00:06.091
do you know what my first thought was?

1:00:06.180 --> 1:00:07.306
[Rachel] Hmm?

1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:11.385
It's not okay to die.

1:00:14.730 --> 1:00:17.392
The most joyful day of my life,

1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:22.406
and I'm hit with that crushing realization

1:00:22.490 --> 1:00:25.903
that I'm the last line of defense,
you know, against anything.

1:00:28.660 --> 1:00:33.871
I mean, no one can live up
to that standard... not even Marty Byrde.

1:00:41.470 --> 1:00:42.368
To Buddy.

1:00:43.470 --> 1:00:44.505
To Buddy.

1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:52.978
You know, the last time I saw him,
I cut him.

1:00:55.270 --> 1:00:56.430
-What?
-Yeah.

1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:58.511
The last few days there, he was...

1:01:02.610 --> 1:01:05.158
He was worse than ever, you know?
Obviously.

1:01:06.820 --> 1:01:08.868
And he couldn't get out of bed and...

1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:12.862
And so, I helped him shave.

1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:17.746
Cut him. [chuckles]

1:01:22.130 --> 1:01:24.007
Last thing I did was hurt the guy.

1:01:24.090 --> 1:01:28.459
-Aw, you didn't mean to.
-Yeah, I know. Doesn't matter. I hurt him.

1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:35.936
All right, I'm gonna clean up.

1:01:39.610 --> 1:01:40.599
Listen...

1:01:43.570 --> 1:01:45.026
if this goes wrong,

1:01:45.110 --> 1:01:47.863
ifI don't pull off
opening up this casino,

1:01:48.620 --> 1:01:50.941
I want you to know that
I'm not gonna leave you hanging, okay?

1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:58.031
Um, what do you mean?

1:01:59.130 --> 1:02:02.418
I mean, there's a guy in Chicago,
a private investigator.

1:02:03.260 --> 1:02:07.549
And if this fails, you're gonna go to him.

1:02:08.140 --> 1:02:10.631
And he's gonna make sure
that the feds can't touch the Blue Cat.

1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:12.301
You're gonna get it back, okay?

1:02:12.850 --> 1:02:15.341
You can do whatever you want with it.
Sell it. Keep it.

1:02:16.390 --> 1:02:17.641
But it'll be up to you.

1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:21.140
You understand?

1:02:22.110 --> 1:02:23.099
Okay.

1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:28.279
No one's ever gonna know
what you did to help me.

1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:32.983
Not the feds, not the cartel.

1:03:10.700 --> 1:03:11.564
[Rachel] Yeah.

1:03:12.070 --> 1:03:13.025
Wait.

1:03:13.660 --> 1:03:15.366
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.900
-I-- I can't.
-Sorry. I know.

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:20.115
-I'm sorry. It's my fault.
-Marty.

1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:24.831
I'm sorry.

1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:27.002
-Marty...
-I know. I'm...

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:29.757
I'm sorry. Okay?

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:30.886
I know. Hey...

1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:32.846
Rachel.

1:03:48.820 --> 1:03:50.731
[soul music playing]

1:04:11.380 --> 1:04:15.009
Hang ups, let downs

1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:20.219
Bad breaks, setbacks

1:04:21.310 --> 1:04:25.428
Natural fact is

1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:29.889
0h, honey, that I can ’t pay my taxes

1:04:30.780 --> 1:04:35.114
0h, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands

1:04:35.950 --> 1:04:40.319
Yeah, it makes me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands

1:04:40.410 --> 1:04:41.650
Oh, oh/

1:04:41.750 --> 1:04:45.459
Crime is increasing

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:50.543
Tr/gger happy policing

1:04:52.170 --> 1:04:55.333
Panic is spreading

1:04:57.100 --> 1:05:00.388
God knows where we ’re heading
