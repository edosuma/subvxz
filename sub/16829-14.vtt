WEBVTT

00:03.270 --> 00:04.336
(door opens)

00:04.338 --> 00:06.071
PAIGE:
(chuckles) Okay.

00:06.073 --> 00:08.240
Well, don't forget
your sunblock.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.208
Yeah, I miss you, too.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.609
I'll talk to you tonight.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.211
Okay. Mwah. Bye.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.679
That Cabe?

00:13.681 --> 00:14.713
Funny.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.382
Tim says hi.
What is this?

00:16.384 --> 00:17.716
Mapping grid of
the section of the ocean

00:17.718 --> 00:19.118
that we're covering today.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.519
Ocean? We're doing
the Department of Energy

00:20.521 --> 00:21.520
server upgrade today.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.055
Nope.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.590
That job has been
postponed indefinitely.

00:24.592 --> 00:28.027
What? I-I spent weeks
landing that contract.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.763
And Walt spent minutes
dismantling it.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.164
Explanation. Now.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.150
Well, it's quite simple really.

00:34.151 --> 00:36.135
Our point person at the D.O.E.
kept saying he was gonna pay us

00:36.137 --> 00:37.803
"A hundred and
nine thousand dollars."

00:37.805 --> 00:39.605
Yeah, that's what we agreed to,
$109,000.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.775
Ah-ah-ah, that's not
what he said.
Here we go.

00:42.777 --> 00:45.444
He said "A hundred<i> and</i>
nine thousand dollars."

00:45.446 --> 00:47.312
That's a $100 bill and $9,000.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.481
That's substantially less
than our fee.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.417
For the love of God,
Walter, it's an expression.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.052
Well, "Make haste, not waste"
is an expression.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.553
"Penny for your thoughts"
is an expression.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.455
"Not playing with a full deck"
is an expression!

00:56.457 --> 00:58.390
Exactly, but what
the D.O.E. rep said

00:58.392 --> 00:59.591
was mathematically inaccuracy.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.527
And I told him.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.062
Repeatedly.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.563
I mean, don't people want
to better themselves?

01:04.565 --> 01:05.831
The irony of that question

01:05.833 --> 01:08.133
is completely lost on you,
isn't it?

01:08.135 --> 01:12.104
Hmm. I can tell that
you're upset, but don't be

01:12.106 --> 01:13.772
because I got us
a new case.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.375
We are working
with a well-funded

01:16.377 --> 01:18.544
Marine salvage concern
that believes it's found

01:18.546 --> 01:20.712
the<i> San Caldera, </i>
a Manila galleon

01:20.714 --> 01:22.748
that went down
in Drakes Bay in 1595

01:22.750 --> 01:24.984
carrying a fortune in gold.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.219
O-Okay, but who is this client,
and what are we doing for him?

01:27.221 --> 01:28.654
Her. And Joan Davis found us.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.489
She e-mailed us
after reading

01:30.491 --> 01:33.292
about our use of echolocation
in the bat caves of Arizona

01:33.294 --> 01:35.527
and wants us to utilize
our tech

01:35.529 --> 01:37.396
to find the missing treasure.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.332
We designed a depth-penetrating
acoustic gun.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.202
It shoots sound waves into
the water that bounce upwards.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.870
Floating hydrophone mics
send the readings

01:44.872 --> 01:48.173
to our tablets, so we can map
the ocean floor debris.

01:48.175 --> 01:51.844
And I rigged the Proton Arnold
cabinet so I can control

01:51.846 --> 01:52.845
those babies.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.864
PAIGE: Are those...?
Yep.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.882
Deactivated World War Two
torpedoes.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.551
Retrofitted propulsion
with wireless control

01:59.553 --> 02:03.288
and waterproof cameras so these
submersibles can have a look-see

02:03.290 --> 02:04.756
at what's in
Davey Jones' locker.

02:04.758 --> 02:05.791
CABE:
I named 'em

02:05.793 --> 02:08.861
Ethel Mer-man
and Water Matthau.

02:08.863 --> 02:09.828
No idea who they are.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.296
TOBY:
(whistles) Ah!

02:11.298 --> 02:12.898
(pirate voice):
Perfect cannonball strike.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.502
Is me gang of buccaneers ready
to find some precious booty?

02:16.504 --> 02:19.138
Argh, looks like
I already found me some.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.373
Keep it up, and I'll knee you
in your doubloons.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.509
That would send me
to the E-Argh!

02:23.511 --> 02:24.877
I'm not joking.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.145
(normal voice):
Saucy wench, ain't she?

02:26.147 --> 02:28.313
Leave me out of it,
Captain Schnook.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.749
Walter, it's great
that you lined up another gig,

02:30.751 --> 02:32.351
but you have to run
these things by me.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.253
Paige, do not
kibosh this job.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.321
I've been obsessed
with pirates since I was a kid.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.923
<i> Treasure Island--</i>
I read that so many times,

02:37.925 --> 02:39.291
the binding fell apart.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.893
Makes perfect sense, actually.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.794
Pirate culture fetishizes
the thrill of the hunt

02:42.796 --> 02:44.796
and the procurement
of treasure.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.231
Those are the foundations
of gambling addiction.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.233
What is the pay on this job?

02:48.235 --> 02:51.170
Uh, we'll be working
for a five percent commission.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.505
(pirate voice):
No prey, no pay!

02:53.507 --> 02:55.707
A contingency agreement?
You're not ambulance chasers.

02:55.709 --> 02:56.875
You're geniuses.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.344
Geniuses who better get moving.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.247
So Happy will stay here,
drive the robotic submersibles;

03:02.249 --> 03:04.183
Sly, you will run
point on the mapping.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.250
Let's go. Gear up.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.619
CABE:
Allie.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.956
Glad I caught you.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.958
You left this at my place.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.960
It's a nice excuse
to see you again.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.962
(Sylvester clears
throat loudly)

03:16.964 --> 03:19.965
Cabe, uh, don't you think
carousing with the enemy

03:19.967 --> 03:21.833
is at cross purposes
with your role

03:21.835 --> 03:22.968
as my campaign manager?

03:22.970 --> 03:24.620
I'm not your enemy.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.271
My boss just insists
that I work on his campaign

03:26.273 --> 03:27.623
every two years.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.974
And you had nothing to do
with the ad that ran

03:28.976 --> 03:29.975
that depicted me as a wizard?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.577
I bought the airtime.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.429
That's it.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.280
Kid, only a handful
of people saw that ad.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.217
A handful of votes is all
it'll take to decide this race!

03:39.787 --> 03:41.770
I'm sorry.

03:41.771 --> 03:43.754
I am just tense because
the<i> West Altadenia Shopper</i>

03:43.757 --> 03:45.490
has not announced
their endorsement yet,

03:45.492 --> 03:48.260
and their reporter
will not call me back.

03:48.262 --> 03:51.230
They get lazy because
they always endorse Patel.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.332
I'll make sure you
get a fair shake.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.667
I'll see you later?

03:55.669 --> 03:56.969
Absolutely.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.239
Do you think
Zachariah Chandler,

04:00.241 --> 04:02.307
campaign manager
for Rutherford B. Hayes,

04:02.309 --> 04:05.244
dated the chargé d'affaires
for Samuel J. Tilden

04:05.246 --> 04:07.579
in the election of 1876?

04:07.581 --> 04:10.749
If he looked like Allie,
he damn well should've.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.284
(pirate voice):
Let's shove off, me hearties!

04:12.286 --> 04:14.553
High seas adventures awaits.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.257
(sighs)

04:21.362 --> 04:24.396
Bounty's out there.
I can smell it.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.764
Think that's your cologne.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.899
Oh, you like that? It's
got the essence of pirate.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.001
It's called Walk the Stank.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.902
Guys, focus on the task?

04:30.904 --> 04:32.938
Oh, yes. A very long
and difficult task

04:32.940 --> 04:35.007
which will most likely result
in no money

04:35.009 --> 04:37.576
because no one knows where the
ship or the gold actually is.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.678
That's because they didn't
know where to look.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.812
WALTER:
Ms. Davis?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.281
You must be Team Scorpion.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.482
You're Joan the Pirate?

04:43.484 --> 04:44.783
What were you expecting?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.018
I was expecting
Indiana Joan,

04:46.020 --> 04:48.020
a rapscallion huntress,
like Anne Bonny

04:48.022 --> 04:50.222
or Mary Read.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.423
Most people think this business
is pure excitement.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.027
It's actually extensive research
and meticulous calculations.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.962
That sounds exciting to me.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.665
I was quite impressed by
your theory that ripple effects

04:59.667 --> 05:01.300
of a previously unknown
historical tsunami

05:01.302 --> 05:02.768
took the<i> Caldera</i> off course.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.036
Thank you.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.305
My contemporaries mock me,

05:06.307 --> 05:08.674
but we'll be laughing
when we find the gold.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.343
Here are the maps
of the areas we'll be searching

05:11.345 --> 05:12.744
from our respective boats.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.046
These are our
pirate vessels?

05:14.048 --> 05:16.081
Sturdy 40-foot fishing vessels.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.649
Just had them serviced.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.052
More than sufficient
for our work.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.853
When we find the treasure,
I'll call for larger ships

05:21.855 --> 05:23.422
with retrieval cranes.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.856
Okay. Let's get to work.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.725
So, Paige and I will
start in the small boat.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.060
The rest of you
go with Joan.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.429
We'll start off at
the far end of our grids,

05:30.431 --> 05:32.764
work our way in,
and then meet up at the middle

05:32.766 --> 05:35.434
so no fathom goes unsearched.
Great.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.337
I'm not gonna let these
pathetic vessels kill my buzz.

05:38.339 --> 05:41.373
The action out on the
water will be thrilling.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.408
Exhilarating.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.085
TOBY:
<i> Uh....</i>

05:53.087 --> 05:55.687
I've never been so bored
in my life.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.689
Mr. Curtis, I warned you.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.691
This is tedious work.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.793
Shoot the acoustic gun,
wait for readings,

06:01.795 --> 06:05.097
record the readings, repeat.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.798
That is the job description.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.367
Thought we'd be
cutting up treasure.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.968
All I'm doing is cutting cheese.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.038
(beeping)

06:13.040 --> 06:15.874
Our hydrophone mics have
picked up some more kickback

06:15.876 --> 06:17.409
from the acoustic gun.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.878
SYLVESTER: According to
acoustic bounceback,

06:19.880 --> 06:22.514
it's non-organic solid material.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.815
Happy?

06:23.817 --> 06:26.952
I am sending Water Matthau down
for a closer look.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.020
Go get 'em, Happy.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.159
HAPPY:
Ah, strikeout.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.827
Looks like you're positioned

06:35.829 --> 06:37.562
over a rock formation.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.481
I'll re-dock Water Matthau
under the boat.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.399
<i> Walter, how come you're not</i>
<i> sending me anything?</i>

06:41.402 --> 06:42.768
WALTER:
<i> I've been asking myself</i>

06:42.770 --> 06:43.936
the same thing.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.103
Haven't had a ping
in over two hours.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.706
We're only 60 nautical
miles from Toby's boat.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.175
There shouldn't be such a
discrepancy in the results.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.843
Maybe your equipment's off.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.645
Yeah. Now that you mention it,

06:53.647 --> 06:55.781
my comm's been cutting in and
out since we got on the boat.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.816
Well, it is possible that
the boat's electronic system

06:57.818 --> 06:59.785
is interfering
with our tech.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.186
We'll check it out.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.857
Okay.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.193
We might be able to remove the
boat's electrical system.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.896
(grunting): That might be able
to eliminate the interference.

07:10.898 --> 07:11.997
Oh, smells funny.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.799
Oh, this is an issue.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.834
Joan just had
the boat serviced.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.669
The workers didn't tighten
the fittings properly,

07:17.671 --> 07:19.871
so the fumes made denser
air, which made it harder

07:19.873 --> 07:21.673
for the electrical
signals to operate.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.542
We have to get off
this boat. Here!

07:23.544 --> 07:25.477
What's going on?
This could spark any moment.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.845
Surrounded by gas.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.647
The boat's gonna explode.
Get in the water!

07:28.649 --> 07:29.681
(grunts)

07:29.683 --> 07:31.750
(Paige screams)

07:33.887 --> 07:35.487
(both panting)

07:35.489 --> 07:36.488
Okay?

07:36.490 --> 07:38.757
Yeah.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.192
Walter?
Uh-huh.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.227
Are you sure
the boat's gonna explode?

07:42.229 --> 07:43.695
Uh, well,

07:43.697 --> 07:45.764
the odds were
better than not.

07:45.766 --> 07:49.701
Okay, 'cause I'm looking
at "not" right now.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.772
Well, it really

07:53.774 --> 07:56.575
is against the odds
that nothing would...

08:02.850 --> 08:05.517
See? I was right.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.798
WALTER:
You okay? Okay.
Yeah.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.167
Well, the good news is
with the ship destroyed,

08:22.169 --> 08:24.870
so is the source
of electrical interference.

08:24.872 --> 08:28.106
So we use the comms
to touch base, tell the guys

08:28.108 --> 08:30.075
what happened, and then
they come and rescue us.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.710
Yeah, you're gonna have
to do that, 'cause my comm

08:31.712 --> 08:33.712
is at the bottom of the ocean;
it fell out when I jumped.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.814
Oh.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.116
Something tells me
your comm's my comm.
That's okay.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.886
The others will eventually
realize that something's wrong

08:40.888 --> 08:43.889
and come for us... hopefully.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.190
I know that look.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.058
That is never good.
Based on the distance

08:47.060 --> 08:48.159
that the boat's traveled

08:48.161 --> 08:50.161
to reach the perimeter
of the grid...

08:50.163 --> 08:51.630
What?

08:51.632 --> 08:52.931
They're over two hours away.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.533
Oh, wonderful.
Okay.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.168
We need a plan, 'cause we can't
tread water that long.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.170
And we'll eventually die
from hypothermia,

08:59.172 --> 09:02.140
so all this debris,
it's gonna save our lives.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.842
We're gonna have
to build a raft.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.176
Let's go.

09:05.178 --> 09:08.847

I'm gonna grab you
by the ankles

09:55.829 --> 09:58.129
and swab the deck
with your head.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.098
At least that'll give me
something to do.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.666
(hydrophone pings)

10:04.004 --> 10:05.937
Got a hit.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.807
Sylvester. Reading.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.276
SYLVESTER: Based on the numbers,
and this is exciting,

10:11.278 --> 10:13.178
these specs are showing
possible organic material,

10:13.180 --> 10:15.280
the general length
of the<i> Caldera's</i> hull,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.949
equally interspersed
solid masses.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.301
Those could be
the on-deck cannons.

10:19.302 --> 10:20.652
This is the closest match
we've seen

10:20.654 --> 10:22.220
to the<i> San Caldera </i>
all day.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.857
Water Matthau needs
a closer look.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.026
He's descending
at a 40 degree angle,

10:28.028 --> 10:29.761
20 knots.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.129
Currently 300 feet away.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.798
I have been working
towards this moment

10:33.800 --> 10:35.367
for the past six years
of my life.

10:35.369 --> 10:38.803
I have been bored for the past
few hours of my life,

10:38.805 --> 10:40.972
so we both got a lot
riding on this.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.874
Toby, hold on
to your frilly hat.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.010
I see something
coming into view.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.715
There she is!

10:50.717 --> 10:53.051
The<i> Caldera.</i> We found it.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.887
I knew I was right.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.722
I'm gonna contact
the retrieval crews.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.392
They will be here in the next
three and a half hours.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.894
(pirate voice):
Arr! There be me booty.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.964
Technically, there be<i> me</i> booty.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.266
There be your five percent.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.201
CABE: Still
a sweet payday.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.772
Congratulations, Walter.
Your gamble paid off.

11:14.741 --> 11:15.907
Walter.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.942
Hey, Walt, you there, buddy?

11:17.944 --> 11:19.978
Actually, Cabe, Walter and Paige
haven't been active

11:19.980 --> 11:21.913
on their comms
for a few minutes now.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.214
That's weird,
'cause I can't seem

11:23.216 --> 11:25.283
to get their submersible
to come online.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.885
You sure?
Yeah.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.421
Nothing from
Ethel Mer-man at all.

11:29.423 --> 11:30.889
Radio silence.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.991
Weird.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.993
Maybe they turned their
treasure ship into a love boat.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.194
Know what I'm saying?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.697
Open water, no one around,
Tim in Qatar...

11:38.699 --> 11:40.999
HAPPY: Zip it, Toby.
Quit clowning around.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.551
Don't be an idiot.

11:42.552 --> 11:44.102
They're just having some
sort of technical issue.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.336
Right, Hap?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.905
It's possible that
an electrical issue

11:46.907 --> 11:48.840
on the boat
knocked out the comms

11:48.842 --> 11:49.974
and the submersible's signal.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.043
(knocking on door)

11:52.045 --> 11:54.029
You go get that.

11:54.030 --> 11:56.014
I'll try to reboot the
connection to Ethel Mer-man.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.082
(door opens)

11:57.084 --> 11:59.350
Oh. Hi, Allie.
Cabe's not here.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.152
I know. I'm here to see you.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.754
I feel bad
about the wizard commercial,

12:02.756 --> 12:04.322
so I want to make it up to you.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.925
This is Patty Logan.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.160
She's a reporter
with the<i> West Altadenia Shopper.</i>

12:09.162 --> 12:10.729
She'd like to interview you.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.297
Hello.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.867
You're a teenager.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.069
I work at the<i> Shopper</i>
for school credit,

12:18.071 --> 12:20.105
but my age isn't relevant.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.072
Oh.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.942
Okay. I need to run,

12:23.944 --> 12:26.745
but I'll leave you two
to discuss the issues.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.913
Good luck, Sylvester.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.350
Okay.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.752
Uh...

12:33.754 --> 12:35.153
Please, come in.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.021
We are just in
the middle of work.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.858
Oh, uh, this might
interest you.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.461
We found a sunken ship
that's centuries old.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.463
Actually, Mr. Dodd,
I'm here to learn about

12:45.465 --> 12:46.998
your platform for alderman.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.167
Now, some say that you're
a one-issue candidate

12:49.169 --> 12:52.137
who only cares about the fate of
his favorite comic book store.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.038
So, setting that topic aside
for the moment, can you explain

12:54.040 --> 12:56.040
how you'd handle the budget
crisis in West Altadenia,

12:56.042 --> 12:58.276
when reports are
you've yet to request a copy

12:58.278 --> 13:01.179
of the city's financials
from the town council.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.248
SYLVESTER: Ms. Logan,
I am a genius.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.917
I haven't requested the budget
because it would take me

13:05.919 --> 13:08.086
less than a few minutes
to read it,

13:08.088 --> 13:11.022
identify any inefficiencies
and then balance it.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.057
Budget not a priority...

13:13.059 --> 13:14.793
Uh, no, no, no.
That's not what I said.

13:14.795 --> 13:15.860
What I said was...

13:15.862 --> 13:18.029
Sly, I need you.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.864
Now?

13:19.866 --> 13:21.065
Excuse me.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.435
Excuse me.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.138
Reboot didn't work.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.740
No contact with my submersible,

13:28.741 --> 13:30.341
and Walter and Paige
are still off their comms.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.010
Hmm.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.246
Something's wrong.
Cabe, you need to go find them.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.415
JOAN:
<i> I'm sorry, gentlemen,</i>

13:37.417 --> 13:39.017
but I'm not leaving this spot

13:39.019 --> 13:40.952
because of
a communications failure.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.954
I'm sure
your crew is fine.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.255
Oh, I don't care if you're sure.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.024
I need to be sure.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.226
Walter O'Brien isn't some flake
who just drops out of contact

13:48.228 --> 13:50.395
with his team; it's completely
out of character.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.097
We need to go
find our friends, now.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.098
My call.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.135
Wrong. This is my boat.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.204
I'm the captain,
and under maritime law,

13:59.206 --> 14:00.505
you have no control here.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.407
So let me be clear.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.009
I'm not leaving the site
of the treasure.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.545
(chuckles)

14:07.547 --> 14:09.180
Fair enough.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.152
There are laws.
This is a mutiny!

14:14.154 --> 14:16.321
While I'm wearing a pirate hat.
How cool is that?

14:16.323 --> 14:18.089
This is a win-win, Joan.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.191
You don't have to leave
the<i> Caldera,</i> we can go

14:20.193 --> 14:21.259
find our friends.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.328
Okay. Sat phone,

14:23.330 --> 14:25.463
water, some energy bars.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.168
(pirate voice): I doff me hat
to you, fair scallywag.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.237
We scurvy dogs must
now bid ye farewell.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.574
Now you're down a bar.
How does that help?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.510
HAPPY:
Toby, quit your grab-ass.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.180
We need to focus. Okay, Cabe,
remember when I helped you

14:42.182 --> 14:43.815
soup up that old Pontiac?

14:43.816 --> 14:45.449
Let me guess. We're gonna
do that to this boat?

14:45.452 --> 14:46.951
I'll walk you through it.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.486
TOBY:
Smart idea, Happy.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.388
It's gonna take a while
to get to Walter and Paige,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.090
and if something's wrong,
every second counts.

14:52.092 --> 14:55.960
Ocean isn't a place you want to
be lost without communication.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.997
Shoelace should
hold for a while.

14:58.999 --> 15:02.200
(exhales) Feels like a vacation
compared to treading water.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.201
What are you doing?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.303
Taking inventory.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.605
Everything that can
help us survive's

15:07.607 --> 15:11.276
in this bag, so I need to
know exactly what we've got.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.111
All the computing power
in the world, and in the middle

15:13.113 --> 15:15.179
of the ocean,
you can't do a thing with it.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.547
Uh, wrong.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.017
For now, it's a table.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.953
Here.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.589
I am building

15:24.590 --> 15:27.224
an astrolabe to help determine
our exact position.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.559
Happy already knew
the coordinates

15:28.561 --> 15:30.328
of our boat before it blew up.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.463
Well, consider this
a confirmation.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.882
Or a waste of time.

15:33.883 --> 15:35.300
Determining facts is
never a waste of time.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.302
I don't care about facts,
but since you love them so much,

15:37.304 --> 15:39.171
would you like to hear one?

15:39.172 --> 15:41.039
If you hadn't pissed off
the Department of Energy rep,

15:41.041 --> 15:42.573
if you could've just accepted
that some people

15:42.575 --> 15:44.475
say "one hundred
<i> and</i> nine thousand"

15:44.477 --> 15:46.577
instead of "one hundred
nine thousand..."

15:46.579 --> 15:48.079
It was inaccurate.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.314
...we could've been
working a nice,

15:49.316 --> 15:51.149
landlocked, dry job,
instead of floating

15:51.151 --> 15:53.117
in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean on a leaky raft.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.321
So let me ask you. Was it,
was it worth being right?

15:58.658 --> 16:00.091
Yes.

16:09.169 --> 16:12.303
MAN:<i> Dispatching a vessel now,</i>
Seven Seas.<i> Over.</i>

16:12.305 --> 16:13.705
Okay. Thank you.

16:13.707 --> 16:16.407
All right. The Coast Guard's
gonna send out a team,

16:16.409 --> 16:20.278
but their ship is further
away than we are.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.280
Hey, Happy.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.615
I don't see anything.
Are we getting close?

16:24.617 --> 16:27.552
Less than a mile out from
your last logged location.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.420
SYLVESTER: You should be
seeing them any second.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.223
CABE:
Hey, Toby, bear right.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.992
I see something up ahead.
That's got to be them.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.527
(pirate voice):
Aye, Captain. Starboard ho.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.297
Oh, my God.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.565
What do you see?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.433
CABE:
Pieces of their boat.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.669
Nothing else.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.139
PAIGE: They should've
found us by now.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.541
A high probability they have--
should've discovered

16:50.543 --> 16:52.143
the boat wreckage
right about now.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.244
Yeah. Well, I hate
to break it to you,

16:53.246 --> 16:54.645
but there's no boat
on the horizon.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.682
That's because we're nowhere
near the wreckage.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.351
What are you...
What are you talking about?

16:59.352 --> 17:01.019
Debris can't be more
than 50 yards in any direction.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.520
We've just, we've just
been bobbing here.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.555
Well, it just
feels that way.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.458
The astrolabe uses the sun's
position to measure latitude,

17:07.460 --> 17:09.794
so according to it,
we are over 20 miles

17:09.796 --> 17:11.496
from the site
of the explosion.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.698
That's impossible.
Current can be deceiving.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.216
They won't know
where to find us.

17:15.217 --> 17:16.733
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.336
'Cause you said you weren't
interested in facts.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.071
Are you kidding me?

17:20.072 --> 17:21.805
You're acting like the flow
of the current is my fault.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.142
No. I'm acting like the fact
is we're going to die out here.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.777
We could drown. We could starve.
We could dehydrate.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.712
There are a hundred and
fifty thousand different ways

17:27.714 --> 17:28.713
we could kick the bucket.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.415
That's how I'm acting.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.451
One hundred fifty thousand.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.186
(groans):
Oh, my...

17:35.188 --> 17:37.255
(groans)

17:44.164 --> 17:45.596
I studied detailed
images of Walter's ship,

17:45.598 --> 17:47.765
and the bad news is, half
the boat and what's left of

17:47.767 --> 17:50.334
Ethel Mer-man are at
the bottom of the ocean.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.569
Must've been an explosion.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.571
What's the good news?

17:53.573 --> 17:54.605
I've scanned
every inch of this thing,

17:54.607 --> 17:55.773
and there's no sign of bodies.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.542
Not to be morbid,
but if they were

17:57.544 --> 17:59.844
blown to bits,
there'd be, well, bits.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.512
And that would've attracted
scavengers of the sea,

18:01.514 --> 18:03.081
and there's none of that here.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.149
That means that Walter
and Paige are still alive.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.851
Oh, man. They're drifting.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.186
On what?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.320
If it was me,
I would've engineered

18:09.322 --> 18:11.322
some kind of makeshift raft

18:11.323 --> 18:13.323
out of the debris,
tied it together with shoelaces

18:13.326 --> 18:15.093
and cable from the hydrophones.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.327
Walt probably did the same.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.529
We're in the North Pacific
Gyre current.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.131
It's large and swirling
and occupies

18:20.133 --> 18:22.500
the northern basin
of the Pacific.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.534
How do you know that?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.503
I was a Marine.

18:25.505 --> 18:30.141
As in mariner, maritime,
related to the sea?

18:30.143 --> 18:32.643
I don't like Condescending Cabe.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.145
According to
the National Oceanic

18:34.147 --> 18:36.014
and Atmospheric Administration,

18:36.015 --> 18:37.882
the movement of northern waters
southward plus the upwelling

18:37.884 --> 18:40.551
of colder sub-surface water

18:40.553 --> 18:43.454
makes the coastal
current stronger.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.523
Well, what does that mean
about their location?

18:45.525 --> 18:48.659
It means that
from where you are now,

18:48.661 --> 18:52.430
the last place that we knew
they were alive,

18:52.432 --> 18:55.266
they are most likely...
(sighs)

18:55.268 --> 18:57.668
dozens of miles out,

18:57.670 --> 19:00.338
in any direction.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.540
PATTY: This is an
incredible story.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.509
Can you tell me
how you're feeling right now?

19:04.511 --> 19:06.310
How do you plan
to find your friends?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.714
I'm sorry, uh, I have to focus.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.783
Happy, we need to figure out
a plan to narrow

19:12.785 --> 19:14.685
the 360 degree range
that they could be in.

19:14.687 --> 19:18.222
If only we had
Walt's brain right now.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.593
You know that
song Toby likes,

19:22.595 --> 19:26.531
"Brandy," about the girl who's
a-a waitress in a harbor town?

19:26.533 --> 19:30.535
Uh, by all accounts,
she was quite the catch,

19:30.537 --> 19:33.538
but the man in the song
wouldn't marry her

19:33.540 --> 19:35.439
because he loved
the sea so much

19:35.441 --> 19:37.341
that he couldn't
be away from it.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.515
He was an idiot.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.919
I have faith that our team will
find us, so, you know, optimism.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.761
I-I find it confusing
that... (chuckles)

19:56.763 --> 20:00.398
you are giving me the silent
treatment, when the truth is,

20:00.400 --> 20:03.467
you are more to blame for our
current situation than I am.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.569
What?

20:04.571 --> 20:05.670
You heard me.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.804
You must have sun stroke.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.739
Oh, you know, I-I
have fact stroke.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.608
Fact: I'm afflicted with low EQ.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.976
Oh, tell me something
I don't know.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.945
Fact: As a result, I often

20:13.947 --> 20:15.947
can't connect with humans.
And how.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.282
Fact: despite knowing all that,
you still abandoned me.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.951
You still let me
deal with people like

20:19.953 --> 20:21.919
the Department of Energy rep
when you know I shouldn't!

20:21.921 --> 20:22.954
Abandoned you?

20:22.956 --> 20:24.589
Please, Paige.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.757
You know, I-I might have no EQ,

20:26.759 --> 20:28.993
but I am more than capable
of picking up when someone

20:28.995 --> 20:31.229
is trying to distance
themselves from me.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.399
It happened at school

20:34.400 --> 20:35.833
when kids could tell
that I was different,

20:35.835 --> 20:38.002
I felt it with my parents,
and now, then...

20:38.004 --> 20:40.905
then i-it happened with you.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.275
Walter...

20:44.277 --> 20:47.445
You have completely cut me loose
these past weeks.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.780
Completely missing in action
when I need you.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.582
Walter, I...
No, I...

20:51.584 --> 20:56.020
I understand that
eventually I can be

20:56.022 --> 20:58.723
too much for most humans,
but I thought...

20:58.725 --> 21:00.958
I thought that...

21:00.960 --> 21:02.860
you were different.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.864
I thought that we were friends.

21:10.903 --> 21:14.038
(sighs) You're right, I...

21:14.040 --> 21:17.975
I did distance myself
from you... on purpose.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.977
But it's not because
I don't like you anymore.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.046
It was part of a plan
to let you sink or swim,

21:22.048 --> 21:24.982
to see if... I wanted to see if
you could get to another level

21:24.984 --> 21:27.235
of EQ on your own,

21:27.236 --> 21:29.487
to see if you could grow
without me holding your hand,

21:29.489 --> 21:31.055
because I believe you can.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.725
So you decided to run
an emotional experiment on me?

21:34.727 --> 21:36.427
No, no, that's not
how I looked at it.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.429
It's your job
to hold my hand.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.765
That's why you're
on Scorpion.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.400
I should dock your pay.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.934
I wanted to believe
that my work with you

21:43.936 --> 21:46.003
these last three years
haven't been wasted,

21:46.005 --> 21:48.739
that if you fell,
you could get up on your own

21:48.741 --> 21:50.708
without me there to pick you up
and dust you off.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.943
Shh. Quiet.
Don't tell me to be quiet.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.412
No, no, no.
Listen, listen.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.914
(bell clanging faintly)
Wait.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.750
Is that a...
Is that a bell?

21:59.752 --> 22:02.687
It's got to be a high-end
acoustic buoy.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.989
If we can get to it,
I might be able to hack

22:04.991 --> 22:07.758
the wireless relay box,
and send out an S.O.S.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.627
Now, the trick is picking
it up with the naked eye

22:09.629 --> 22:12.330
in the middle of the ocean.
Wait.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.432
No, we won't have to.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.800
What?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.335
Your reading glasses?

22:17.337 --> 22:19.603
At Ralph's last
Forestry Braves meeting,

22:19.605 --> 22:21.539
they taught us
how to make a telescope

22:21.541 --> 22:25.609
out of a lens and a...
paper towel tube.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.412
We just have to find...

22:28.414 --> 22:30.481
Ah! This PVC pipe should do.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.083
Good thinking.

22:32.085 --> 22:35.953
Now I will fashion oars
from this wood over here.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.723
But it will weaken the raft
substantially,

22:38.725 --> 22:40.958
so we better find that buoy.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.793
You see anything?
Uh, yeah.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.563
A lot of water.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.897
Wait, over there.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.766
Something just
a few miles, tops.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.801
Time to paddle.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.009
SYLVESTER:
<i> The currents are too mixed</i>

22:59.011 --> 23:01.812
and unpredictable to narrow down
which direction they drifted.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.647
There are too many
variables.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.116
Well, the constant is
Walt and Paige

23:05.118 --> 23:06.817
floating around on a raft.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.086
That's it! The raft.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.456
Happy, can you pull up
the film of their wreckage?

23:13.760 --> 23:15.393
Tell me why
I'm doing this.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.561
Well, look at the blown-out
back of the boat.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.064
What kind of material do you
think that's made out of?

23:20.066 --> 23:22.666
Treated cedar on the deck,
thermoplastic fiberglass--

23:22.668 --> 23:25.035
both float well.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.670
And some PVC pipes

23:26.672 --> 23:29.140
floating under the
plumbing system.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.609
Okay, start calculating the
ballpark buoyancy force numbers

23:31.611 --> 23:35.179
for those materials, and throw
in some floatation cushions

23:35.181 --> 23:36.947
and some pieces of life vests.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.649
Hold on, are you saying you can

23:38.651 --> 23:40.084
figure out where
your friends are

23:40.086 --> 23:41.869
based on the scraps
they used to build a raft?

23:41.870 --> 23:43.653
I'm saying if we figure out
the general weight and buoyancy

23:43.656 --> 23:45.122
of those materials,
we can plug those numbers

23:45.124 --> 23:46.891
into an algebraic function
to predict

23:46.893 --> 23:48.526
how the current
would have treated them,

23:48.528 --> 23:50.060
and then we can find
the general area.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.729
Slow down. Say it all again,

23:51.731 --> 23:53.664
but not so many
big words this time.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.065
(chuckles) I'm sorry,
but you got to go.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.168
No, wait, this is a great story.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.836
It's not a story,
it's my friends' lives.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.671
We haven't even gotten
to the interview yet.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.840
I don't even have
a single quote from you.

24:02.842 --> 24:03.908
Well, here's this.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.543
Candidate says, "Beat it."

24:05.545 --> 24:06.777
But, Mr. Dodd...

24:06.779 --> 24:08.512
Sly, I got the buoyancy data!

24:12.552 --> 24:14.485
Let's do some math.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.189
Still nothing, Doc.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.090
I'm starting to get
real scared here.

24:20.092 --> 24:23.194
My whole life, I wanted a chance
to be a swashbuckling hero.

24:23.196 --> 24:26.063
Now our friends need us,
I'm just a schmuck on a boat

24:26.065 --> 24:28.098
with no idea how to save them.
SYLVESTER: Not anymore.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.734
Now you are a schmuck
with an idea.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.703
We ran the numbers based
on the estimated weight

24:32.705 --> 24:35.206
of Walter, Paige
and the raft.

24:35.208 --> 24:38.108
We accounted for buoyancy
and the current differential...

24:38.110 --> 24:39.577
Just tell them where
the hell they are.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.579
Uh, right, okay.
Based on my calculations,

24:41.581 --> 24:43.914
they should be 30 degrees east

24:43.916 --> 24:44.982
of the wind flow.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.550
(pirate voice):
Me bicorne!

24:48.120 --> 24:49.854
All right, wind's
blowing southwest.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.489
Okay, then turn the boat
30 degrees east

24:51.491 --> 24:52.923
of the southwesterly winds.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.525
We're on our way.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.801
(buoy bell clanging)

25:05.738 --> 25:07.538
I'm gonna jump on first, okay?

25:07.540 --> 25:08.973
Okay.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.675
Great.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.512
(grunts)

25:14.514 --> 25:15.813
Come on.
Oh, wait.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.681
Whoa, whoa, here, here.
I'm drifting.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.085
You got it.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.086
Whew!
Okay.

25:22.088 --> 25:24.054
Oh, God.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.756
I never thought we'd make it.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.225
Tie this up.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.194
You got it?

25:30.196 --> 25:31.862
Yeah.
(grunts)

25:31.864 --> 25:33.097
Okay.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.165
Here.
Thanks.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.570
Hold on while
I get online.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.939
Okay.

25:41.941 --> 25:46.010
Now, these buoys
allow scientists

25:46.012 --> 25:50.648
to monitor ocean patterns
in real time.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.250
So I'm gonna use
the Wi-Fi transmitter

25:53.252 --> 25:56.287
to send a signal to the shore.

25:56.289 --> 25:59.290
Ah, from these markings,
it's a Danish lab outpost.

25:59.292 --> 26:00.991
Oh.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.961
I hope whoever's monitoring
it speaks English. (chuckles)

26:03.963 --> 26:05.796
Okay, I'm into
their system.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.099
(loud bang)

26:09.101 --> 26:11.201
(buoy bell clanging)

26:14.206 --> 26:16.273
Wow, that was
a big current.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.745
Uh, Paige?
Yeah?

26:21.747 --> 26:24.114
That wasn't a current
that just struck us.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.888
We're gonna need
a bigger buoy.
Mm-hmm.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.929
(buoy bell clanging)

26:40.833 --> 26:42.132
Hold on, hold on.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.204
(thud)
Oh, God!

26:49.775 --> 26:52.009
Oh, my God.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.110
You okay?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.279
Oh, no. Oh, no.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.814
This is very bad.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.383
He snapped the cable.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.151
Even if he doesn't come back,

27:01.153 --> 27:02.720
we have no ride off this buoy.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.822
Yeah, he's turned around
and coming back at us.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.157
Okay, hold on.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.360
(thud, bell clanging)

27:10.963 --> 27:11.996
Oh, oh, oh!

27:11.998 --> 27:13.797
(panting)

27:14.967 --> 27:17.701
I'm gonna send out
an S.O.S. signal.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.170
You have to stop the shark
from knocking this tablet,

27:20.172 --> 27:21.305
or worse yet us,
into the water.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.974
How do I do that?
Sharks have intense

27:23.976 --> 27:26.043
neural ganglion
in the center of their snouts.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.312
Here, use that oar to
whack him on his next pass.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.280
That'll disorient him, and
that'll buy me enough time

27:30.282 --> 27:33.050
to set up the tablet
and get the message out.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.319
That's the plan-- you want me
to punch a shark in the nose?

27:35.321 --> 27:37.855
He-He's circling back.
Here, grab the oar.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.924
This more than makes up for the
pay you were going to dock me.

27:40.926 --> 27:43.293
Okay, here he comes. Oh, God.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.197
It worked!

27:47.199 --> 27:50.134
We're into the
satellite signal.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.736
Uh, found a
communications interface.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.705
Sending the message,
and then done.

27:54.707 --> 27:57.207
Great, let's just hope who
finds it can actually help us.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.309
(rapid beeping)

28:02.348 --> 28:05.082
(Danish accent):
Bernhard?

28:19.832 --> 28:21.932
D-876. Got it.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.367
Thank you.

28:24.203 --> 28:27.204
Uh, yes, it's a real election.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.807
Alderman of West Altadenia--
Look, I got to go.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.776
According to some
confused Danish scientists,

28:32.778 --> 28:35.279
Walter and Paige are
at the buoy D-876.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.947
Those are the coordinates.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.982
Okay, guys, you're already
headed in the right direction,

28:38.984 --> 28:41.318
and you're closer
than the Coast Guard.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.755
Just need to slightly adjust
course three degrees west.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.524
We're on it.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.292
Eyes peeled for a yellow buoy
with people clinging to it.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.860
Shouldn't be more
than a few of those.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.061
SYLVESTER:
And, Cabe,

28:51.063 --> 28:52.796
you said only
a handful of people

28:52.798 --> 28:55.165
watched Patel's ad,
but guess what--

28:55.167 --> 28:57.034
it made it to Denmark.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.836
Denmark!

28:58.838 --> 29:00.471
(thud)

29:05.911 --> 29:07.044
Walter!

29:12.418 --> 29:14.418
I think he's pissed
about the punch to the nose.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.754
Well, sharks are intelligent;
they have a sixth sense

29:16.756 --> 29:20.324
called electrosensory
perception to track their...

29:20.326 --> 29:22.259
You were gonna say "prey."

29:22.261 --> 29:24.495
Ah...
(thud)

29:24.497 --> 29:26.230
(gasps)

29:27.133 --> 29:28.999
(shrieks)

29:29.969 --> 29:32.436
That was too close, Walter.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.772
I have faith in Scorpion.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.440
Besides, from a
logical standpoint,

29:36.442 --> 29:38.876
the odds are pretty slim that
things could get any worse.

29:38.878 --> 29:39.910
(thud)

29:39.912 --> 29:41.145
(both gasp)

29:41.147 --> 29:43.347
Holy cow, things just got worse.

29:43.349 --> 29:44.848
How?

29:44.850 --> 29:46.250
After the Danish
scientists called,

29:46.252 --> 29:48.285
I hacked their system
to monitor any readings

29:48.287 --> 29:50.053
that their buoy might receive
that could help us

29:50.055 --> 29:51.355
with our rescue--

29:51.357 --> 29:55.359
like the changes in current
or wave cap heights,

29:55.361 --> 29:56.393
stuff like that.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.345
So what's the problem?

29:58.346 --> 30:00.296
Problem is
they don't study the ocean.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.398
They study what lives

30:01.400 --> 30:03.467
inside the ocean.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.269
Specifically,
migratory patterns.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.204
Migratory patterns of what?

30:08.174 --> 30:10.440
(buoy bell clanging)

30:10.442 --> 30:12.309
(gasping)

30:12.311 --> 30:13.443
I think he's bringing
his friends!

30:13.445 --> 30:15.579
Actually, you know,
a group of sharks

30:15.581 --> 30:16.947
is called a "frenzy."

30:16.949 --> 30:20.350
Walter, who gives a crap?!

30:20.352 --> 30:22.486
Sharks? Are you kidding me?

30:22.488 --> 30:24.154
A frenzy of them.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.456
A group of sharks
is called a "frenzy."

30:26.458 --> 30:27.825
Who gives a crap?!

30:27.827 --> 30:29.326
Hundred yards ahead!

30:29.328 --> 30:32.429
I can see the buoy,
and Walter and Paige!

30:32.431 --> 30:34.464
And sharks,
lots and lots of sharks.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.866
Punch it, Gallo.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.237
Walter, they're closing in!

30:40.239 --> 30:42.406
(gasping)
(thud)

30:42.408 --> 30:44.875
The impact of multiple
sharks is gonna be

30:44.877 --> 30:47.311
exponentially worse than
just one, so brace yourself.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.312
(thud)

30:48.314 --> 30:50.147
I think we spoke too soon.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.216
Hey! Hey, hey!

30:52.218 --> 30:54.085
TOBY:
They see us!

30:54.086 --> 30:55.953
We did it!
We're heroes of the high seas!

30:55.955 --> 30:57.387
(pirate voice):
Keep the wind at our backs,

30:57.389 --> 30:59.323
and take this girl
to port, Cap'n.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.225
(engine sputtering)

31:01.227 --> 31:03.126
(hissing)

31:03.128 --> 31:04.194
What the hell?

31:04.196 --> 31:05.963
Oh, this isn't
happening.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.197
What isn't happening?

31:07.199 --> 31:09.233
TOBY:
The boat's engine blew,

31:09.235 --> 31:11.301
and we're still about
50 yards from the buoy.

31:11.303 --> 31:14.238
Not good! When we souped it up,
we must've pushed its limits.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.506
It's toast.
No, Walter
and Paige are toast

31:16.508 --> 31:18.141
if they can't get to them!

31:18.143 --> 31:19.376
(thud, bell clanging)

31:19.378 --> 31:20.611
Hey, what's happening?

31:20.613 --> 31:23.013
Why aren't they
coming to get us?

31:23.015 --> 31:25.215
WALTER: Uh, I see smoke.
The boat must've died.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.767
Yeah, well,
speaking of dying,

31:26.768 --> 31:28.318
we can't hold on much longer;
this buoy's gonna tip.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.157
You were a
lifeguard, right?

31:34.159 --> 31:36.894
Uh, in summers when
I was a teenager. Why?

31:36.896 --> 31:38.262
I'm gonna swim
for the raft.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.364
The flailing will
attract the sharks.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.599
No.
Shark's worst sense
is their eyesight.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.002
They'll circle me to try and
figure me out before attacking.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.136
It'll give me time.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.654
Now, as soon as
I hit the water,

31:47.655 --> 31:49.171
you dive in and
head for the boat.
Walter, no.

31:49.174 --> 31:50.908
Even if you make it
to the raft,

31:50.910 --> 31:52.242
they will tear that
thing apart in seconds.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.944
You said it yourself.
Eventually, this buoy gets

31:53.946 --> 31:55.479
tipped over, and I can't have
you on it when that happens.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.214
Walter...
As flawed as I am,

31:57.216 --> 31:59.383
I'm still a better person
than before we met,

31:59.385 --> 32:01.518
thanks to you.
Now go!
Walter!

32:13.399 --> 32:15.198
They're making a break
for the boat.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.466
No, only Paige is.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.035
Walt's trying to
get to the raft.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.536
He's never gonna make it.
He's chum in the water.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.551
♪ ♪

32:44.330 --> 32:46.430
Grab my hand!

33:04.450 --> 33:08.285
(panting):
Walter is... Walter is...

33:08.287 --> 33:09.720
In big trouble.

33:09.722 --> 33:12.723
Those sharks are circling him;
they're figuring him out.

33:12.725 --> 33:15.425
Once they figure out
he's lunch, it's all over.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.432
(panting)

33:24.003 --> 33:27.070
I'm not gonna make it.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.507
Not gonna... not gonna make it.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.380
What the...?

33:39.251 --> 33:41.151
(shouts)

33:41.153 --> 33:42.452
It's Water Matthau!

33:42.454 --> 33:45.622
Cabe and Toby, get ready
to receive your cargo.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.360
Thank you, Happy!

33:50.362 --> 33:51.695
Here he comes.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.533
So do the sharks.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.368
Uh, Happy, sharks top out
at 35 miles per hour.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.037
Can you goose
Mr. Matthau, please?

34:00.039 --> 34:01.471
HAPPY: It's been
straining to keep up

34:01.473 --> 34:02.506
with your boat for hours.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.575
40 miles per hour
is all he's got.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.643
And I got to slow it down so
that Walter can get on the boat.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.578
You slow that thing down,
the sharks will be all over him!

34:08.580 --> 34:10.714
And the torpedo wake
is agitating them.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.450
I have an idea.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.153
Hurry! Hurry, Happy!

34:16.155 --> 34:17.521
What the hell are you doing?

34:17.523 --> 34:19.356
Swashbuckling!

34:30.235 --> 34:31.635
(shouts)

34:34.773 --> 34:36.840
(Toby grunting)

34:39.411 --> 34:40.777
Yes!
Yes!

34:40.779 --> 34:43.080
(Walter groans)

34:43.082 --> 34:45.549
Thanks for the lift.
What's with the knife?

34:45.551 --> 34:47.851
I'm a super-cool pirate.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.853
I got seaweed in my eye.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.455
Dropped me cheese knife.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.357
(chuckles)

34:58.630 --> 35:01.531
Huh? A little hot cocoa

35:01.533 --> 35:04.167
should warm the weary bones
of you seafarers.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.470
How is your eye?

35:06.472 --> 35:08.438
Little seaweed
never hurt Blackbeard.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.474
It ain't gonna slow
this hardened Jolly Roger.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.776
Oh, baby marshmallows.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.578
I love those.
HAPPY:
Almost forgot.

35:14.580 --> 35:15.745
This came in from Joan Davis

35:15.747 --> 35:17.447
while you were heading
back into shore.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.715
Pieces of eight!

35:21.620 --> 35:23.253
PAIGE:
Chocolate coins?

35:23.255 --> 35:24.788
What the...?

35:24.790 --> 35:28.625
"Dear Team Scorpion,
you're in breach of contract.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.160
"Section B2 clearly
states that your team

35:30.162 --> 35:31.328
"was to provide tech support

35:31.330 --> 35:33.163
"until the moment of retrieval.

35:33.165 --> 35:35.365
"You made your choice
to abandon the treasure,

35:35.367 --> 35:37.434
"so you are entitled

35:37.436 --> 35:40.270
to no contingency fee.
Sincerely, Joan Davis."

35:40.272 --> 35:41.538
Hmm.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.340
But sh-she's right.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.175
We did breach contract.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.643
To save you guys,
it was worth it.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.179
Plus, we can license
the tech we designed

35:49.181 --> 35:50.680
to other maritime
exploration concerns.

35:50.682 --> 35:53.183
No matter how you slice it,
she absconded with me booty.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.784
This sucks.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.692
Pretty disappointed, huh?

36:02.694 --> 36:05.729
I wanted treasure.
I got chocolate.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.597
Yeah, about the whole...

36:07.599 --> 36:10.500
Captain Hook thing.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.536
Pirates chase treasure.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.671
Gamblers chase money.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.607
It's the chase that
gives them the high.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.411
Boy howdy, it does.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.648
So... what if it's the chase

36:24.650 --> 36:26.750
that's kept you
on your toes with me?

36:31.557 --> 36:33.557
Once we're married,

36:33.559 --> 36:37.861
the chase is over, the high is
over, and then you'll get bored.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.729
Happy Quinn,
you're showing an adorable

36:39.731 --> 36:41.698
pang of insecurity right now.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.501
My angst makes you feel good?

36:44.503 --> 36:46.703
No, no.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.705
The fact that
you love me enough

36:48.707 --> 36:52.676
to worry about losing me
makes me feel good.

36:52.678 --> 36:55.278
Look me in the eye.
Uh, the good one.

36:56.582 --> 37:00.684
You are the treasure that I've
been hunting for my whole life.

37:00.686 --> 37:03.653
And-and you, frankly,
are such a tough nut to crack

37:03.655 --> 37:07.824
that the chase
is never really over.

37:07.826 --> 37:11.828
You keep me on my heels.
I'm never gonna be bored by you.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.897
Good.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.469
Keep the hat...

37:19.471 --> 37:22.372
the eye patch...

37:22.374 --> 37:23.740
for the honeymoon.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.476
Ahoy, matey.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.752
Hey.
Hey yourself.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.837
You ready?

37:36.838 --> 37:37.921
Reservation's
in 20 minutes.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.990
Let me grab my coat.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.630
Sylvester.

37:46.632 --> 37:47.964
I spoke with Patty.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.800
I bet you did.
Congratulations.

37:50.802 --> 37:54.671
You got the endorsement
and the votes and the election.

37:54.673 --> 37:57.507
I think you and Patty had very
different takes on your meeting.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.576
It's an early edition
of the paper.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.879
<i> "West Altadenia Shopper </i>
endorses Sylvester Dodd."

38:02.881 --> 38:04.481
CABE:
Really?

38:04.483 --> 38:07.717
That's the biggest upset
since Ali/Foreman in '74.

38:07.719 --> 38:11.621
I have no idea who that is,
but this is amazing news.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.524
Thank you.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

38:15.694 --> 38:17.661
"Sylvester Dodd is a candidate
who cares more about the people

38:17.663 --> 38:19.429
"that are counting on him
than making sure

38:19.431 --> 38:20.964
"he looks good to the press.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.432
"He has the kind of character

38:22.434 --> 38:24.434
that will make him
a fine representative."

38:24.436 --> 38:27.504
Congratulations.
You earned it.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.342
Good work, kiddo.

38:35.447 --> 38:38.415
(door opens, closes)

38:42.688 --> 38:43.987
Hey.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.822
Hey.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.328
I-I wanted to thank you.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.330
What you did on that buoy

38:53.332 --> 38:54.898
(chuckles):
was insane.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.666
I-I would have made it
to the raft.

38:56.668 --> 38:59.002
Oh, uh, don't think so.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.471
And it's not really the point.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.106
Well, it was the least
I could do.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.741
I owed you.

39:04.743 --> 39:05.942
Owed me? For what?

39:08.980 --> 39:12.349
For, uh...
for letting me sink or swim.

39:12.351 --> 39:15.085
See, at first, I was...
I was mad at you

39:15.087 --> 39:17.854
because I-I didn't understand
why you would do that to me.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.726
Mm-hmm.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.894
But then I realized

39:24.896 --> 39:27.997
that you did it<i> for</i> me.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.033
I've never had anyone who cared

39:30.035 --> 39:32.736
about my emotional
development before,

39:32.738 --> 39:36.139
someone who'd try
different things to help me.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.441
But you care.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.677
And, um...

39:40.679 --> 39:43.947
sometimes caring means
tough love.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.850
So I owed you, so I jumped in.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.488
An extreme way of
paying off debts, but...

39:51.490 --> 39:54.524
I don't think
you owed me.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.159
Walter, can I be honest?

39:56.161 --> 39:57.494
Mm, of course.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.162
You're the most
honest person I know.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.564
Okay. Here goes.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.768
I-I tried being mad at you
for the whole Tim thing,

40:04.770 --> 40:06.803
and that just...

40:06.805 --> 40:09.406
well, it felt crummy.
So I have an idea.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.641
I'd... I'd like for us
just to acknowledge

40:11.643 --> 40:13.176
that we're great friends,

40:13.178 --> 40:16.780
special friends,
who care deeply

40:16.782 --> 40:19.449
about each other,
the-the kind of friends

40:19.451 --> 40:21.918
who'd do anything for
each other, including...

40:21.920 --> 40:23.520
risk their lives.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.722
That's...

40:25.724 --> 40:27.424
That's accurate and logical.

40:27.426 --> 40:29.492
Yeah. I like it.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.461
Great.

40:31.463 --> 40:35.165
Um, we can put any
recent tension behind us.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.633
Agreed. Yeah.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.802
(slaps legs)

40:38.804 --> 40:41.438
So, friend...

40:41.440 --> 40:43.440
(chuckles)

40:43.442 --> 40:45.542
...uh, what do you have
planned for tonight?

40:45.544 --> 40:48.545
I'm just gonna...
like, Skype with Tim.

40:48.547 --> 40:49.846
You?

40:50.782 --> 40:53.016
I w-worked up a list of clients

40:53.018 --> 40:55.785
that I've recently offended;
I was gonna...

40:55.787 --> 40:59.022
try to, uh, apologize to them.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.758
Using the-the skills
that you taught me.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.827
Okay.

41:05.597 --> 41:09.899
You know what, um, I could,
I could Skype with Tim tomorrow.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.901
How-how about we make
those calls together,

41:11.903 --> 41:14.170
and I can help you
through any rough spots?

41:14.172 --> 41:17.040
I'd like that.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.641
Okay.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.582
Can I see?
Yeah.

41:25.584 --> 41:26.816
Here you are.
Thanks.
