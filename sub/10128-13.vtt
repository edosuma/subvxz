09:02.200 --> 09:03.400
TO HEAR YOUR VOWS.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.467
THOSE AREN'T MY VOWS.
THOSE ARE YOUR VOWS.

09:06.467 --> 09:09.834
UH, TOPANGA,
I APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT,

09:09.834 --> 09:14.200
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
I CAN WRITE MY OWN
WEDDING VOWS?

09:14.200 --> 09:17.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY?

09:17.200 --> 09:18.667
OK.

09:19.867 --> 09:23.300
SOMETIMES TWO PEOPLE
WHO LOVE EACH OTHER

09:23.300 --> 09:25.133
ARE IN LOVE.

09:25.133 --> 09:28.834
AND BECAUSE
OF THAT LOVE...

09:28.834 --> 09:31.600
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.100
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WRITE THE VOWS.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.767
OK, NOW, REGARDING
OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

09:35.767 --> 09:37.200
TOPANGA!

09:37.200 --> 09:38.300
BERMUDA.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.200
I'LL CALL YOU
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.800
NO, CORY, WE'RE GOING
TO HONEYMOON IN BERMUDA.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.300
IT'S THE PERFECT CLIMATE,
FABULOUS FOOD,

09:44.300 --> 09:47.400
AND JUST ABOUT
THE BEST DARN SNORKELING
THIS SIDE OF ANYWHERE.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.567
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE IN THE OCEAN.

09:49.567 --> 09:51.200
I WANT TO BE IN THE ROOM.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.000
A LOT.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.100
WHY ARE YOU
SO OBSESSED WITH SEX?

09:55.100 --> 09:57.000
BECAUSE I DON'T GET ANY.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.767
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

09:58.767 --> 10:00.734
TELEPHONE.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.934
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.600
ISN'T MY PATIENT
LITTLE CORY CUTE?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.233
HE'S NOT GONNA BE SO CUTE

10:07.233 --> 10:09.300
WHEN HIS PATIENT
LITTLE HEAD EXPLODES.

10:12.033 --> 10:15.967
SHAWN'S FATHER
HAD A HEART ATTACK.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.500
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.934
DID YOU HIT ME?

10:28.934 --> 10:30.934
YOU HAD A HEART ATTACK.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.100
OH.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.834
WHERE ARE ALL
THE OTHER PATIENTS?

10:34.834 --> 10:37.200
YOU GOT YOUR OWN ROOM.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.033
WELL, THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

10:40.033 --> 10:41.600
JACK PAID FOR IT.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.000
WHERE IS JACK?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.200
HE'S OUTSIDE
FILLING OUT SOME FORMS.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.200
LISTEN, DAD,
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

10:47.200 --> 10:48.967
ABOUT WHAT I WAS SAYING
BACK AT THE APARTMENT.

10:48.967 --> 10:50.934
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

10:50.934 --> 10:52.767
WHAT THE HECK
IS WRONG WITH HER?

10:52.767 --> 10:55.900
SHE THINKS SHE CAUSED
YOUR HEART ATTACK
WITH HER CAKE OF DEATH.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.100
I DIDN'T SAY
MY CAKE CAUSED IT.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.934
I SAID IT WAS
A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.

10:58.934 --> 11:00.400
THAT SUCKER
WAS RICH, MAN!

11:00.400 --> 11:02.934
I STILL GOT
CHEST PAINS MYSELF.

11:02.934 --> 11:04.600
COME HERE, DARLIN'.

11:05.934 --> 11:08.600
NOT YOU, YOU MORON!

11:10.567 --> 11:12.400
LOOK, IT WEREN'T
YOUR CAKE OF DEATH

11:12.400 --> 11:14.200
WHAT GIVE ME
THE HEART ATTACK.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.000
IT WAS SHAWN'S
YELLIN' AND SCREAMIN'.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.233
I GUESS YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER.

11:19.233 --> 11:21.000
I'LL GO TELL JACK
YOU'RE AWAKE.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.800
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OK.
I WAS SO SCARED
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.700
YEAH, DUDE, THE WAY
YOUR EYES WERE BUGGING
OUT OF YOUR HEAD,

11:26.700 --> 11:28.834
THAT WAS
TOTALLY COOL, MAN.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.834
WELL, I'LL TELL YA,
IT'S WORTH LIVING

11:30.834 --> 11:33.100
JUST TO LOOK AT
THIS LOVELY FACE.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.033
OH, YOU'RE SUCH
A SWEET MAN.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.300
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

11:37.300 --> 11:39.934
THERE IS SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO FOR ME.

11:39.934 --> 11:41.300
TOMORROW'S
JACK'S BIRTHDAY...

11:41.300 --> 11:43.467
IF YOU COULD PICK HIM UP
SOMETHING NICE

11:43.467 --> 11:45.233
FOR ME TO GIVE HIM.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.667
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:46.667 --> 11:49.000
I THINK I HAVE
THE PERFECT THING.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.600
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, OK?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.500
REST UP.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.300
OK, CHET.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.767
JUST TRY TO RELAX,
ALL RIGHT?

12:06.033 --> 12:09.300
HEY. HE'S ASLEEP AGAIN.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.734
GOOD. SLEEP IS GOOD.

12:11.734 --> 12:14.300
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
PROBABLY GONNA SOUND CRAZY,

12:14.300 --> 12:15.867
BUT THIS WHOLE ORDEAL

12:15.867 --> 12:18.867
CAN BE A--A BLESSING
IN DISGUISE.

12:18.867 --> 12:20.767
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

12:20.767 --> 12:22.367
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO
SLOW DOWN, RIGHT?

12:22.367 --> 12:24.033
SO MAYBE HE'LL
STICK AROUND FOR A WHILE.

12:24.033 --> 12:25.900
JACK, THE SECOND
HE GETS OUT OF HERE,

12:25.900 --> 12:27.200
HE'S GOING STRAIGHT
TO VEGAS.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.967
DON'T SAY THAT,
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW.

12:28.967 --> 12:31.734
I DO KNOW.
I KNOW HIM.

12:31.734 --> 12:32.734
I <i>AM </i>HIM.

12:32.734 --> 12:34.100
YOU'RE NOT, SHAWN.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.367
YES, I AM.

12:35.367 --> 12:38.000
WHY CAN'T I GET CLOSE
TO ANYBODY IN MY LIFE?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.567
I'M EXACTLY LIKE HIM.

12:39.567 --> 12:42.367
LOOK AT YOU AND ME.
WE'RE BROTHERS, RIGHT?

12:42.367 --> 12:44.500
WE'RE NOT CLOSE AT ALL.

12:45.800 --> 12:46.767
HEY.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.700
HOW YOU GUYS
HOLDING UP?

12:49.700 --> 12:52.834
FINE.
I'LL BE FINE.

12:52.834 --> 12:55.567
THANKS FOR COMING DOWN,
MR. AND MRS. MATTHEWS,
MR. FEENY.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.600
BOYS, TAKE ALL
THE TIME YOU NEED.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.000
DON'T WORRY ABOUT SCHOOL.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.967
JUST TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAD
AND YOURSELVES.

13:01.967 --> 13:04.400
AND YOU KNOW THAT
IF YOU NEED TO TALK,

13:04.400 --> 13:05.600
WE'RE HERE.

13:08.133 --> 13:09.867
SHAWN?

13:11.400 --> 13:12.600
I'M FINE.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.934
ANY WAY YOU COULD SLIP
A LITTLE TEQUILA IN THAT THING?

13:16.934 --> 13:21.200
YOU MEAN TO GO WITH
THAT CIGAR YOU'RE HIDING
UNDER THE MATTRESS?

13:21.200 --> 13:24.734
YOU KNOW, I'M DATING THIS
TALL, BEAUTIFUL REDHEAD,

13:24.734 --> 13:28.100
BUT I'D DROP HER IN A SECOND
FOR YOU, SWEET BUNS.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.100
YOU REPULSE ME.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.734
WELL, HE'S ALERT.

13:32.734 --> 13:35.467
HEY, HOW YOU FEELING?

13:35.467 --> 13:37.300
I'VE BEEN BETTER,
BEEN WORSE.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.700
FEENY.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.400
THAT'S SOME COLLEGE
THEY GOT YOU AT.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.567
YOU'RE MOVING UP
IN THE WORLD, HUH?

13:43.567 --> 13:46.400
WITH THAT POOL TABLE
AND EVERYTHING.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.967
MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER,

13:47.967 --> 13:50.200
WE'LL PLAY A LITTLE GAME
OF, UH, 9-BALL?

13:50.200 --> 13:51.734
50 BUCKS.

13:51.734 --> 13:54.033
I'LL LET YOU BREAK.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.800
YOU'RE ON.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.567
UM, ALAN, COULD I
ASK YOU A BIG FAVOR?

13:59.567 --> 14:00.800
ANYTHING YOU WANT, CHET.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.500
CAN YOU LOOK AFTER
MY BOYS AFTER I'M GONE?

14:04.500 --> 14:07.500
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.000
CHET, YOU'RE NOT DYING.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I DON'T MEAN DYING.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I MEAN WHEN I MOVE
TO LAS VEGAS.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.300
WELL, WOULDN'T YOU
RATHER BE HERE
WITH YOUR BOYS?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.967
PLEASE LOOK AFTER THEM.

14:25.033 --> 14:26.867
OF COURSE
I'LL LOOK AFTER THEM.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.200
BUT I'M NOT
THE ONE THEY NEED.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.300
SHAWN?

14:44.734 --> 14:45.800
OH, HEY, GUYS.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.767
HOW YOU DOING?

14:47.767 --> 14:51.133
GOOD. I WAS JUST...
RESTING MY EYES.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.300
HOW'S YOUR DAD?

14:55.300 --> 14:58.400
WELL, THE DOCTOR
SAYS HE MIGHT NEED
BYPASS SURGERY.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.000
IS IT OK IF WE GO IN
AND SEE HIM?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.100
YEAH. YEAH,
HE'D LIKE THAT.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.367
YOU OK?

15:22.367 --> 15:25.800
HE'S LYING IN THERE,
HE'S SICK...

15:25.800 --> 15:28.000
I SHOULD BE PUTTING
MY ARMS AROUND HIM

15:28.000 --> 15:30.500
AND TELLING HIM
THAT I LOVE HIM.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.934
BUT I CAN'T, CORY,

15:31.934 --> 15:35.133
BECAUSE I AM STILL
SO ANGRY AT HIM.

15:41.734 --> 15:45.300
YOU KNOW, SHAWNY,
ALL THESE YEARS
HE'S BEEN SORT OF...

15:45.300 --> 15:47.834
BLOWING IN AND OUT
OF YOUR LIFE.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.934
BUT NOW YOU GOT HIM
RIGHT IN THERE,

15:49.934 --> 15:53.567
AND HE ISN'T
GOING ANYWHERE.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.400
MAYBE I'M
NOT THE ONE

15:55.400 --> 15:56.834
YOU SHOULD BE
TALKING TO.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.300
[WHISPERING]
How's he doing?

16:10.300 --> 16:12.767
HE LOOKS SO HELPLESS.
YEAH.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.500
ALTHOUGH HIS NURSE
DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK
HE WAS SO HELPLESS.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.500
I OFFERED HER A JOB
TAKING CARE OF HIM
WHEN HE GETS HOME.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.233
I CAN STILL HEAR HER
LAUGHING.

16:19.233 --> 16:22.500
HE DOESN'T NEED A NURSE.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF HIM.

16:22.500 --> 16:26.233
LOOK, UH, HE NEEDS
PROFESSIONAL CARE,
SHAWN, YOU KNOW?

16:26.233 --> 16:29.133
I CAN JUST ARRANGE
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.
IT'S OK.

16:29.133 --> 16:31.400
WOW.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.100
YOU'VE GOT THIS WHOLE SITUATION
FIGURED OUT, DON'T YOU?

16:35.100 --> 16:37.233
I'M JUST TRYING TO TAKE
CARE OF THINGS, MAN.

16:37.233 --> 16:40.000
YEAH, YEAH. WELL,
I GUESS IT'S EASY
TO BE EFFICIENT

16:40.000 --> 16:42.200
WHEN YOU'RE NOT FEELING
WHAT I AM.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.300
DON'T TELL ME HOW
I'M FEELING, OK?

16:46.300 --> 16:47.667
I'M HIS SON, TOO.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.500
ARE YOU?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.233
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE KID,

16:51.233 --> 16:54.567
DID YOU SIT NEXT TO HIM
WHILE HE WATCHED TV
ALL NIGHT LONG,

16:54.567 --> 16:57.767
HOPING THAT HE'D SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU?

16:57.767 --> 17:01.400
DID YOU EVER ONCE
CLEAN UP AFTER HIM
WHEN HE CAME HOME DRUNK?

17:01.400 --> 17:03.367
AND WHEN HE DIDN'T
COME HOME AT ALL,

17:03.367 --> 17:05.667
DID YOU LAY IN BED THINKING
IT WAS SOMETHING <i>YOU </i>DID

17:05.667 --> 17:07.967
THAT DROVE HIM AWAY?
AND WHEN HE WAS GONE,

17:07.967 --> 17:10.900
DID YOU WALK AROUND
AND MAKE BELIEVE
THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK,

17:10.900 --> 17:14.100
WHEN INSIDE IT WAS
TEARING YOU APART?

17:14.100 --> 17:15.467
DID YOU?

17:15.467 --> 17:17.100
NO.

17:17.100 --> 17:21.300
NO, I--I DIDN'T
GET TO DO ANY
OF THOSE THINGS.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.300
YOU SEE, I KNEW
I HAD A FATHER,

17:23.300 --> 17:27.200
AND HE WAS
GONE FROM ME
MY WHOLE LIFE.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.400
BUT YOU TURNED OUT
OK, JACK.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.800
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.600
YOU DEAL WITH THINGS.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.000
ME, I'M JUST ANOTHER
VERSION OF HIM.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.700
SH-SHAWN.

17:42.867 --> 17:46.500
OH, GOD, DAD,
YOU'RE UP.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.467
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
DO RIGHT BY YOU, SON.

17:50.467 --> 17:53.000
I'M A LOUSY FATHER.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.700
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID?

17:55.700 --> 17:58.467
YEAH.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.967
YOU BEEN SAYING IT
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

18:00.967 --> 18:03.000
I JUST NEVER LISTENED.

18:04.467 --> 18:06.900
I'M LISTENING NOW.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.767
I'M REALLY
SCREWED UP, DAD.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.200
IT'S LIKE I'M
WATCHING MYSELF
DO THESE THINGS

18:22.200 --> 18:23.867
THAT I HATE,

18:23.867 --> 18:25.233
AND I CAN'T
STOP THEM.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.000
WHY COULDN'T YOU
JUST STICK AROUND?

18:31.800 --> 18:34.500
WASN'T I GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

18:34.500 --> 18:37.800
NO, SHAWN. I WASN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.000
I NEED YOU, DAD.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.467
I NEED YOU, TOO, SON.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.100
AND THIS TIME, BOYS...

18:48.100 --> 18:49.967
I'M STAYING.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.700
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.667
NOT THIS TIME.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.600
YOU MEAN IT?

18:57.600 --> 19:00.100
'CAUSE
I FEEL LIKE...

19:00.100 --> 19:04.033
I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN HELP ME.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.600
WE'RE--WE'RE A FAMILY.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.400
IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME
WE STARTED ACTING LIKE ONE.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.600
HEY, HEY, YOU.

19:14.600 --> 19:18.000
YOU GOT A BIRTHDAY
COMIN' UP.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.500
OW.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.600
HERE.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.667
OPEN IT UP.

19:24.667 --> 19:27.467
SEE WHAT I GOT--
GOT YOU.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.834
DAD, WHAT'S WRONG?

19:34.834 --> 19:37.033
MAYBE YOU BETTER
CALL SOMEBODY.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.000
UH...UH...

19:39.000 --> 19:40.100
DAD!

19:40.100 --> 19:41.900
SOMEBODY HELP!
A DOCTOR!

19:41.900 --> 19:45.200
I'M SORRY...SHAWN.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.867
DAD?

19:48.200 --> 19:49.200
DAD!

19:54.867 --> 19:57.200
HE'S BEEN UP THERE
A LONG TIME.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.300
GUYS, I REALLY HOPE
YOUR DAD'S GONNA BE OK.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.467
YEAH. SO DO I.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.367
CHET IS A FIGHTER, BOYS.

20:04.367 --> 20:07.000
AND BESIDES, HE OWES ME
A GAME OF POOL.

20:10.467 --> 20:11.567
HEY.

20:11.567 --> 20:13.100
YOU GONNA OPEN
YOUR PRESENT?

20:13.100 --> 20:14.467
YEAH.

20:24.734 --> 20:27.900
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING
I DON'T HAVE.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.500
WE LOST HIM.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.133
HIS HEART WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH.

20:49.767 --> 20:52.300
I'M SORRY, BOYS.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.133
I'M SORRY.
