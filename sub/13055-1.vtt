09:13.486 --> 09:15.455
2221 SPECK ROAD,
SEATTLE.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.390
IS THAT ADDRESS

09:17.424 --> 09:18.892
I HOPE SO.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.794
THAT'S ALL WE GOT.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.795

09:43.651 --> 09:45.052
Waiter:

09:45.085 --> 09:46.820
HOW LONG HAS HE
BEEN IN THERE?

09:46.854 --> 09:48.521
ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.701
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

10:01.635 --> 10:02.636
REALLY?

10:03.837 --> 10:06.940
DO YOU EAT LIKE THAT
IN FRONT OF YOUR MOTHER?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.942
IT'S AN OLD
FAMILY CUSTOM.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.344
IT'S NOT HEALTHY.
YOU GOTTA TAKE
YOUR TIME.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.181
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT DOES TO
YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM?

10:14.214 --> 10:16.016
NO, BUT I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.252
YOU'VE GOT TO SAVOR
THE QUALITIES OF
THE CUISINE.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.821

10:20.854 --> 10:21.855

10:36.169 --> 10:37.738
THERE HE IS.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.789
HE'S NOT HERE.

10:55.823 --> 10:59.192

I'LL TAKE THE DOCKS.

OH, SHIT!

11:56.984 --> 11:58.518

11:58.551 --> 12:02.122

15:07.574 --> 15:10.043
FREE AIR,
MAN, FREE AIR.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.280
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.048
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.149
LET'S MOVE.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.740
HI, BERNIE, I'D
LIKE SOME PRINTS.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.509
AND THERE'S BLOOD
ON THE BLADE.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.077
I'D LIKE
TO HAVE IT TYPED.
THANK YOU.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.312
WHAT IS
THAT SMELL?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.415
Other officer:
CHRIS, OH, OH...

15:48.448 --> 15:51.318
SOMEBODY'S BEEN
IN A FIGHT, JACK.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.520
WHAT, NOBODY
IN CUFFS HERE?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.022
THIS MEANS
SOMETHING...

15:55.055 --> 15:56.923
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:56.956 --> 15:57.924
I THINK
THAT MEANS

15:57.957 --> 16:00.160
SOMEBODY GOT
THEIR ASS KICKED.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.161
COMPLAINTS.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.162
I'M BERNIE.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.864
OKAY.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.134
GOD, YOU STINK!

16:07.167 --> 16:08.501
HEY, GUYS?

16:08.535 --> 16:12.172
CAPTAIN WANTS TO
SEE YOU IN HIS

16:12.205 --> 16:13.340
A.S.A.P?

16:13.373 --> 16:16.143
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
A SHOWER FIRST.
PLEASE.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.345
Bernie:
I WISH YOU WOULD, BUT
BY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE

16:18.378 --> 16:21.414
I THINK HE'LL SEE YOU AS IS.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.686
Bernie:
WAIT A MINUTE,
CHUCKLES.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.688
CAPTAIN WANTS TO SEE YOU, TOO.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.092
WHAT DID
YOU DO NOW?

16:33.893 --> 16:35.995
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU?

16:36.029 --> 16:37.630
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU GOT YOUR ASS KICKED.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.833
NO, NO,
DON'T SIT THERE.
SHUT THE DOOR.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.370
GENTLEMEN, THIS IS
AGENT THOMAS LUSK

16:43.403 --> 16:45.972
FROM THE REGIONAL
F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.174
DETECTIVE BILL
REIMERS...

16:47.207 --> 16:48.241
HEY, BILLY.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.677
THAT'S CHRIS
LECCE OVER THERE.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.678
CHRIS.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.012
AH, PHIL COLDSHANK.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.013
PLEASURE.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.415
AND JACK PISMO.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.883
RIGHT ON.

16:56.916 --> 16:57.884
HE SAID,
"RIGHT ON."

16:57.917 --> 17:00.520
THE F.B.I. HAS
REQUESTED HELP

17:00.553 --> 17:02.189
OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE OF WEEKS

17:02.222 --> 17:04.257
SO YOUR CASES HAVE
BEEN REASSIGNED.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.325
WHOA, REASSIGNED?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.060
WE ARE CLOSE TO
BREAKING THIS...

17:07.094 --> 17:09.162
A FORKLIFT, WASN'T IT?

17:09.195 --> 17:13.266
FROM NOW ON YOU'RE WORKING
FULL TIME ON THIS.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.867
- KLEENEX, PLEASE.
- IN THE DRAWER THERE.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.671
MR. LUSK IS IN CHARGE
OF THIS OPERATION

17:18.704 --> 17:20.107
SO I'LL LET HIM
TO THE TALKING.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.209
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
FAMILIAR WITH MONTGOMERY

17:22.242 --> 17:24.444
BUT IN CASE YOU'RE NOT,
TWO YEARS AGO

17:24.477 --> 17:27.012
HE KILLED ONE
OF OUR AGENTS.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.349
HE SHOULDA HAD THE CHAIR,
BUT HE HAD A SHARP ATTORNEY

17:29.382 --> 17:32.619
AND THE LOCAL POLICE
WERE TOO ZEALOUS

17:32.652 --> 17:35.021
IN THEIR PURSUIT
OF EVIDENCE.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.056
A PLEA-BARGAIN
KEPT HIM FROM FRYING.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.725
BUSTED OUT OF
STONEHURST?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.293
KILLED A GUARD?

17:40.327 --> 17:43.029
YEAH, HE AND HIS COUSIN
CROSSED INTO WYOMING

17:43.062 --> 17:44.631
DITCHED THEIR TRUCK
AND HAD A CAR WAITING.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.599
IF HE'S IN WYOMING,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

17:46.633 --> 17:48.768
WE THINK HE'LL
HEAD FOR MEXICO

17:48.801 --> 17:51.271
BUT HE HAS FRIENDS HERE

17:51.304 --> 17:53.072
SO WE'RE SETTING UP
A HALF-DOZEN STAKEOUTS.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.774
WE'LL HANDLE THE
IMPORTANT ONES

17:54.807 --> 17:56.876
BUT SINCE WE'RE
A LITTLE SHORT ON HELP

17:56.909 --> 17:58.278
YOUR MEN WILL
TAKE THE OTHERS.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.279
OF COURSE.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.047
WHO WE WATCHING?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.749
HE HAS AN
OLD GIRLFRIEND HERE.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.817
HE HASN'T SEEN HER
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.719
HER NAME IS MARIA McGUIRE.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.721
YOU'LL BE WATCHING HER HOUSE.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.559
THE SECOND PRECINCT
TAKES THE RESTAURANT
WHERE SHE WORKS.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.327
HERE ARE THE KEYS
TO THE APARTMENT
WE RENTED

18:14.361 --> 18:17.063
ACROSS THE STREET
FROM WHERE SHE LIVES.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.232
WE HAVE TO MOVE
ON THIS ONE QUICK.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.833
I KNOW IT'S
SHORT NOTICE

18:20.867 --> 18:24.237
BUT THIS IS REAL BAD
PEOPLE WE'RE AFTER.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.005
DO WE GET A BUG?

18:26.038 --> 18:28.007
HOPEFULLY,
WITHIN 24 HOURS.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.677
AH, JUST ONE
OTHER THING--

18:30.710 --> 18:34.181
IF YOU SPOT
MONTGOMERY, REPORT IT.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.583
NOTHING MORE.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.985
REMEMBER, THIS IS
AN F.B.I. OPERATION.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.187
Chris:
WAIT A SECOND.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.588
EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.191
THERE'S SOMETHING
A LITTLE RIPE HERE.
LET ME ASK A QUESTION.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.694
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
IS, YOU'D LIKE US
TO SIT ON OUR BUTTS

18:47.727 --> 18:50.797
ON SOME LOW-PRIORITY
SHIT DETAIL

18:50.830 --> 18:54.801
ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT WE'LL
RUN ACROSS SOME "BAD PEOPLE"

18:54.834 --> 18:56.436
AND THEN WHAT
ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.305
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GIVE YOU A JINGLE

18:58.338 --> 19:01.174
SO YOU CAN MAKE
THE ARREST AND GET
THE KEYS TO THE CITY?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.875
EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN,
I'M SORRY.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.712
I DON'T LIKE TO
SOUND NEGATIVE

19:05.745 --> 19:07.046
BUT THIS IS BULLSHIT.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.015
I'M A COP.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

19:09.048 --> 19:10.983
I'M NOT A
SECURITY GUARD.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.152
I SEE SOME BAD PEOPLE

19:13.186 --> 19:18.358
I'M GOING TO BE A LITTLE
TOO BUSY TO MAKE A PHONE CALL.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.626
I HOPE THE ATTITUDE

19:19.659 --> 19:21.294
DOESN'T AFFECT
THE PERFORMANCE.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.530
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE HOW
THIS ATTITUDE...

19:23.563 --> 19:24.631
ARE YOU THROUGH

19:24.664 --> 19:26.299
MR. LECCE?

19:26.333 --> 19:28.167
WE'LL CALL.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.210
WHAT AN ASSHOLE.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.177
DEFINITELY.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.479
HEY, HEY!

19:39.512 --> 19:41.814
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THAT KIND OF CRAP.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.384
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THAT SOMEONE ELSE HEARD IT,
GOT IT?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.719
THIS IS A 24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.556
JACK AND PHIL WILL
TAKE THE DAY SHIFT

19:49.589 --> 19:51.558
CHRIS AND BILL
THE NIGHTS.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.593
SAME ROUTINE
AS LAST TIME.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.861
SOMETHING
BOTHERING YOU

19:54.894 --> 19:56.195
MR. COLDSHANK?

19:56.229 --> 19:57.163
NO, NO.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.698
DON'T BULLSHIT ME.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.033
WHAT'S ON YOUR SO-CALLED MIND?

20:01.067 --> 20:03.035
IF IT'S ALL
THE SAME TO YOU, SIR,
I'D JUST AS SOON NOT

20:03.069 --> 20:06.573
BE ON A STAKEOUT
WITH THEM AGAIN.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.375
Jack:
HEAR, HEAR, SIR.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.376
WHY?

20:09.409 --> 20:10.377
WHY?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.979
YEAH. WHY?

20:14.113 --> 20:16.048
CHRIS AND BILL
ARE SLOBS, SIR.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.250
( shocked reaction )

20:17.284 --> 20:20.186
NO, NO.
ON THE LAST STAKEOUT
WE WERE ON WITH THEM

20:20.219 --> 20:21.854
THEY NEVER
ONCE CLEANED UP
AFTER THEMSELVES.

20:21.888 --> 20:22.955
LOOK AT THEM.
SMELL HIM.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.757
LICK MY LEFT ONE,
BUDDY!

20:24.791 --> 20:25.958
YOU LEFT CIGAR BUTTS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.461
OH, PLEASE.
YOU NEVER CHANGED
THE TOILET PAPER.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.963
YOU ARE DISGUSTING.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.533
YOU ARE FILTH.
WHAT ABOUT HIS DOG?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.868
HE LET HIS DOG
PISS ALL OVER
THE CARPET.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.437
THAT'S
A GODDAMN LIE.
COME ON, COME ON.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.205
DON'T BLAME THE DOG.
PHIL DID ALL THE PISSING.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.073
HOW'D YOU LIKE ME
TO PISS ON YOU?

20:41.107 --> 20:42.409
Giles:
SIT DOWN.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.410
SIT DOWN!

20:43.443 --> 20:45.712
I THINK I BROKE
MY ZIPPER.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.814
Giles:
THAT'S ENOUGH.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.383
THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION
TO A PROM, BOYS.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.719
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE DATE.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.388
YOU GENTLEMEN WILL
WATCH THIS BROAD

20:55.422 --> 20:57.390
UNTIL THE FAT LADY SINGS
OR I SAY DIFFERENT.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.392
AND IF YOU FUCK THIS UP

20:59.426 --> 21:01.428
I'LL TAKE YOUR NUTS
AND TIE THEM IN A KNOT

21:01.461 --> 21:03.195
AND RUN THEM
THROUGH MY SHREDDER.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.599
- CAPTAIN?
- YEAH?

21:06.633 --> 21:09.469
PHIL DOESN'T HAVE
ANY NUTS, SIR.

21:09.502 --> 21:13.139
GET OUT, GET OUT.
Phil:
DOWNWIND, PLEASE.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.284
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S HERS.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.320
( Chris groans )

21:28.955 --> 21:31.190
AND WE'RE THERE.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.159
( groans )

21:33.192 --> 21:34.894
HOME SWEET HOME.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.870
Chris:
I HOPE THE PLACE
HAS GOT SOME HEAT.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.806
CAROL'S OKAY WITH
ALL THIS, ISN'T SHE?

21:46.839 --> 21:49.809
BONNIE WILL KILL ME
IF SHE FINDS OUT

21:49.842 --> 21:52.679
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE
FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.682
Both:
* HEIGH-HO, HEIGH-HO

21:55.715 --> 21:59.185
* IT'S OFF TO WORK WE GO...

21:59.218 --> 22:00.920
UGH.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.696
( Cuban accent: )
"LUCY!

22:09.729 --> 22:13.099
YOU GOT SOME
EXPLAINING TO DO."
( Laughs )

22:14.066 --> 22:15.334
VERY ATTRACTIVE.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.770
I THINK JASON
LIVES HERE.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.272
PHEW-WEE.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.545
( coughing )

22:26.513 --> 22:27.880
WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

22:27.914 --> 22:28.881
REALLY.

22:28.915 --> 22:32.318
WHAT THE HELL DID WE
DO TO DESERVE THIS?

22:32.351 --> 22:35.855
WE SENT THAT STRIPPER TO
THE CAPTAIN ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.157
WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THE WOMAN.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.159
YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.528
I SCREWED UP.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.696
( phone rings )

22:45.598 --> 22:46.833
HELLO.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.701
Bill:
HELLO, BABY.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.536
Hi.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.037
Where are you?

22:51.070 --> 22:53.005
RIGHT NOW I'M FREEZING
MY BUTT OFF, STARING
THROUGH A TELESCOPE

22:53.039 --> 22:55.742
AT A HOUSE ON SPECK ROAD.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.044
Didn't anyone ever tell you
that's against the law?

22:58.077 --> 22:59.345
NO PERSONAL CALLS.
NO PERSONAL CALLS.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.181
CHRIS AND I GOT A STAKEOUT
ON THE NIGHT SHIFT.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.784
THAT DOES IT.
I'M CROSSING THE CAPTAIN
OFF THE CHRISTMAS LIST.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.153
( no audio )

23:08.988 --> 23:10.457
UH, CHRIS SAYS HI.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.924
That's nice.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.693
So how long is this one
supposed to take?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.027
COUPLE WEEKS.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.563
A COUPLE OF WEEKS?

23:16.596 --> 23:18.465
JEFFREY WILL BE
FULL GROWN NEXT TIME
YOU SEE HIM.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.700
Yeah, I hope he remembers me.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.535
I GOTTA GO, OKAY?

23:22.569 --> 23:23.703
I LOVE YOU.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.204
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.138
BE GOOD. BYE.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.239
Bye-bye.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.142
PIZZA.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.245
WE'RE IN LUCK.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.983
WE GOT EVERY ROOM COVERED,
EXCEPT THE BATHROOM.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.551
HEY, YOU KNOW, MAYBE

23:38.585 --> 23:39.719
YOU SHOULD
CALL BONNIE.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.554
SHE'D ONLY YELL.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.955
WELL, I CAN CALL HER.
YOU WANT ME TO CALL?

23:42.989 --> 23:44.791
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.125
I CAN CALL HER.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.328
I CAN TAKE CARE OF
MY OWN LOVE LIFE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

23:49.361 --> 23:50.663
GET AWAY, GET AWAY.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.265
SHE'S PROBABLY
IN BED WITH
SOME OTHER GUY.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.502
POOR BASTARD.
POOR BASTARD.

23:55.535 --> 23:58.004
SO, WHO WE
WATCHING ANYWAY?

23:58.037 --> 24:01.440
AH, MISS MARIA GUADALUPE...

24:01.474 --> 24:02.575
GUADALUPE?

24:02.609 --> 24:03.610
...McGUIRE.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.478
IRISH-MEXICAN.

24:05.512 --> 24:08.515
A WAITRESS GOING
TO NIGHT SCHOOL,
BUT NOT THIS QUARTER.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.683
SHE DRIVES A 1980 VOLKSWAGEN.

24:10.717 --> 24:11.951
LIVES ALONE.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.252
NOTHING.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.488
LONG BROWN HAIR,
BROWN EYES.

24:15.522 --> 24:16.689
HMM.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.591
FIVE-FOOT-SIX.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.792
TOO TALL.
FOR US, ANYWAY.
TOO TALL.

24:19.826 --> 24:24.030
OH, AND THE MOMENT WE'VE
ALL BEEN WAITING FOR--

24:24.063 --> 24:26.332
313 POUNDS.

24:26.365 --> 24:27.767
313 POUNDS?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.268
LET ME SEE THAT!

24:29.301 --> 24:30.670
THAT'S FULLY
CLOTHED.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.138
OH, MY GOD!

24:32.171 --> 24:34.674
SHE COULD BE
THE HOUSE!

24:34.707 --> 24:36.709
THIS IS DISGUSTING!

24:36.743 --> 24:38.811
I HATE THIS JOB!

24:44.817 --> 24:47.353
Bill:
"THEY'RE DUSTING OFF
THE HOT SEAT FOR ME."

24:47.386 --> 24:48.120
"ON THE WATERFRONT."

24:48.154 --> 24:49.522
WHO SAID IT ?

24:49.556 --> 24:51.524
LEE J. COBB.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.793
THE 16th PRESIDENT
OF THE U.S.?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.361
I DON'T KNOW.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.864
HERE'S A HINT.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.732
ABE LINCOLN.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.403
OKAY, WHAT MOVIE,
WHAT MOVIE?

25:04.436 --> 25:06.639
"WELL, THIS WAS NOT
A BOATING ACCIDENT."

25:06.673 --> 25:08.240
I DON'T KNOW.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.241
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.844
15th PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.

25:11.878 --> 25:15.014
I DON'T KNOW. FILLMORE.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.015
Chris:
BUCHANAN.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.016
GIVE ME
ANOTHER ONE.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.350
1980 VOLKSWAGEN, RIGHT?

25:18.384 --> 25:19.919
RIGHT.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.990
THE ROCK'S
IN THE SOCK.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.525
WE GOT SOME
MOVEMENT, BUDDY.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.232
THIS IS GUADALUPE?

25:38.638 --> 25:40.573
TURN AROUND.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.011
I THINK SHE'S GONE ON A DIET.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.514
ARE YOU GOING TO SHOOT PICTURES

25:48.547 --> 25:50.850
OR DRAW SOME
FROM MEMORY?

25:50.883 --> 25:51.784
RIGHT, RIGHT.

25:51.818 --> 25:52.852
EXCUSE ME.
PARDON ME.
PARDON ME.

25:52.885 --> 25:53.853
EXCUSE ME.
MY FAULT.

25:53.886 --> 25:54.987
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.759
GOD, SHE'S CUTE.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.297
IT'S 2:30.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.499
I BETTER MAKE
SOME NOTES.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.743
Bill:
SHE'S WALKING
INTO THE KITCHEN.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.481
NOW SHE'S WALKING
ACROSS THE ROOM.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.050
WHERE'S SHE GOING?

26:24.083 --> 26:26.585
LOOKS TO BE
THE BEDROOM.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.455
WHAT'S SHE DOING?

26:29.488 --> 26:31.590
LOOKS LIKE, UH...

26:32.358 --> 26:33.459
LIKE WHAT?

26:35.127 --> 26:36.763
LIKE SHE'S UNDRESSING.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.035
MY GOD!

26:44.503 --> 26:46.005
OH, WOW.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.139
OH, YEAH.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.440
OH, YEAH.

26:48.474 --> 26:50.476
YEAH, YEAH...

26:50.509 --> 26:51.477
NO, NO, NO!

26:51.510 --> 26:52.812
NO, NO, NO, NO!

26:52.845 --> 26:54.480
NO, NO, NO, NO!

26:54.513 --> 26:56.082
Chris:
ARGH! ARGH!
ARGH! ARGH!

26:56.115 --> 26:57.950
TO PROTECT AND TO SERVE.

26:57.984 --> 27:02.855
OOH, OOH, OOH,
I LOVE MY JOB SO MUCH.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.380
JACK, JACK.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.817
WINSTON,
TAKE A BREAK.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.284
( laughter )

27:32.318 --> 27:33.352
GOOD DOG.

27:33.385 --> 27:34.520
YOU LIKE THAT?

27:34.553 --> 27:37.223
WHAT, DID YOU
TEACH HIM THAT?

27:37.256 --> 27:38.357
THAT'S GOOD.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.896
( door opens )

27:46.933 --> 27:48.367
( door closes )

27:48.400 --> 27:50.502
OH, WILL YOU
STOP THAT?!

27:51.403 --> 27:53.639
SUCH A KID
SOMETIMES.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.507
OH, YEAH, FINALLY.

27:55.541 --> 27:58.978
SHE CAME IN AT 2:30
IN THE MORNING.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.547
SHE HASN'T
BEEN UP SINCE.

28:01.580 --> 28:02.681
GOOD-BYE.

28:02.715 --> 28:05.417
Bill:
JUST REPLACE
WHAT YOU STEAL

28:05.451 --> 28:06.385
ALL RIGHT?

28:06.418 --> 28:07.887
( whines )

28:07.920 --> 28:09.756
Phil:
WHAT A DUMP.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.258
Jack:
LOOKS LIKE YOUR
PLACE, HUH, PHIL?

28:12.291 --> 28:13.325
FUNNY.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.361
WATCH WINSTON,
WILL YOU?

28:15.394 --> 28:17.764
I'M GOING TO
TAKE A BREAK.

28:17.797 --> 28:18.898
ALL RIGHT.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.008
IT'S STARTED.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.076
CUTE.

28:31.744 --> 28:32.945
VERY CUTE!

28:33.913 --> 28:34.947
AMATEURS.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.176
( loud engine starts )

29:05.144 --> 29:07.079
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

29:07.113 --> 29:09.248
( loud noise )

29:38.110 --> 29:40.146
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

30:00.399 --> 30:03.202
( phone rings )

30:03.235 --> 30:06.805
( trash can lids crashing )

30:10.176 --> 30:11.343
YEAH?

30:11.377 --> 30:13.379
SO THE ANSWER TO THE QUIZ

30:13.412 --> 30:16.015
"WHY DIDN'T BONNIE
ANSWER THE PHONE?"

30:16.048 --> 30:18.217
IS THAT SHE'S MOVED OUT.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.390
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

30:24.423 --> 30:27.526
Yeah. You want to
go back to sleep?

30:27.559 --> 30:32.398
I ALREADY TRIED THAT.
IT'S TOO GODDAMN LIGHT.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.400
WELL, THEN, PULL THE SHADES.

30:35.567 --> 30:36.702
I CAN'T.

30:36.735 --> 30:38.737
SHE TOOK THEM.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.572
( laughs )

30:40.606 --> 30:42.741
SHE TOOK THE SHADES?

30:42.774 --> 30:45.511
( they laugh )

30:45.544 --> 30:47.179
She paid for them.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.348
SORRY I DIDN'T GET THE PHONE.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.585
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
LET YOU GO BACK TO SLEEP?

30:53.619 --> 30:56.855
UHM... NO, NO.

30:59.091 --> 31:03.662
Look, there's nothing you can
do about it right now, anyway.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.797
HMM...

31:06.899 --> 31:09.201
DID YOU CRACK THE SEAL YET?

31:10.536 --> 31:11.670
NOPE.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.872
Well, then, put it back.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.574
OKAY, DAD.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.577
OH, OH... GOOD NEWS--

31:18.610 --> 31:21.047
WE GET THE PHONE
BUG TONIGHT.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.648
YIPPEE.

31:23.815 --> 31:25.284
KISS CAROL FOR ME.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.219
MMM...

31:28.554 --> 31:30.389
LOWER-- GOOD-BYE.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.059
HOW'S CHRIS?

31:33.092 --> 31:34.360
OKAY.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.861
AND HOW ARE YOU?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.429
I'M TIRED.

31:37.463 --> 31:38.764
TIRED?

31:38.797 --> 31:39.932
MMM...

31:39.966 --> 31:42.401
NOT THAT TIRED.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.937
( engine starts up again )

31:49.808 --> 31:52.244
( noise from tree shredder )

31:56.748 --> 32:00.019
* I WAS LOOKING
OVER YOUR SHOULDER *

32:01.487 --> 32:03.622
* YOU WERE NEXT TO ME...

32:04.623 --> 32:06.325
Driver:
DO YOU EVER THINK

32:06.358 --> 32:08.794
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER YOU DIE?

32:08.827 --> 32:10.462
Stick:
AFTER I DIE?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.999
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN?

32:13.032 --> 32:15.367
I'M GOING TO BE
REINCARNATED...

32:16.335 --> 32:17.970
...AS A JUDGE.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.007
FORGET IT, BAD TOPIC.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.642
SO, I WANT TO GET PAID, RIGHT?

32:23.675 --> 32:26.312
FIGURE SHE STILL HAS YOUR MONEY?

32:26.345 --> 32:27.679
I KNOW SHE'S
STILL GOT MY MONEY.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.515
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER

32:29.548 --> 32:31.017
IN A YEAR
AND A HALF.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.019
YES, BUT SHE
DOESN'T KNOW

32:33.052 --> 32:34.553
SHE'S GOT IT.

32:40.859 --> 32:42.894
( phone rings )

32:56.975 --> 33:00.346
( no dialogue )

33:00.379 --> 33:04.183
Maria:
...over to Peter's. I'm sure
he'll have some money for bail.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.318
I'm coming up to your house.

33:06.352 --> 33:10.156
No, Mom... Mom, I'm hanging
up right now, all right?

33:10.189 --> 33:11.390
Good-bye.

33:21.367 --> 33:22.634
Operator.

33:22.668 --> 33:23.869
OPERATOR, YEAH.

33:23.902 --> 33:27.339
CAN YOU GIVE ME SEATTLE,
I MEAN, AREA CODE 206...

33:27.373 --> 33:28.874
( phone rings )

33:28.907 --> 33:30.509
YEAH, WHAT?

33:30.542 --> 33:32.010
DON'T YOU EVER SAY "HELLO"?

33:32.044 --> 33:32.844
YOU READY?

33:32.878 --> 33:34.646
I'M READY WHEN YOU ARE, C.B.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.882
OKAY, AND LET HER ANSWER

33:36.915 --> 33:38.684
before you cut them.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.058
( phone rings )

33:46.092 --> 33:48.026
( busy signal )

33:48.960 --> 33:50.862
I DON'T KNOW.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.831
( Maria's phone rings )

33:52.864 --> 33:54.533
Bill:
What did you do?

33:54.566 --> 33:55.534
YEAH?

33:55.567 --> 33:57.803
Â¿COMO ESTA, MARIA?

33:58.804 --> 34:00.139
HELLO?

34:01.773 --> 34:03.409
GUESS WHO THIS IS.

34:05.811 --> 34:06.945
HELLO?

34:06.978 --> 34:08.547
HELLO, HELLO?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.047
HELLO?

34:19.658 --> 34:21.293
( knocks )

34:27.299 --> 34:28.567
HI.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.703
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
I'M FROM THE PHONE COMPANY.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.572
APPARENTLY THERE'S
A LINE PROBLEM
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.739
SERIOUSLY?

34:34.773 --> 34:36.275
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOUR PHONE?

34:36.308 --> 34:38.076
YEAH, MY PHONE'S DEAD.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.146
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
ALREADY HERE.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.880
WELL, WE GOT A LOT
OF CALLS, YOU KNOW.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.983
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD IS DOWN.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.418
WELL... YOU KNOW

34:46.452 --> 34:49.455
IT'S REALLY NOT A VERY
GOOD TIME FOR ME.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.456
I HAVE TO BE GOING.
I UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.559
IT WOULD ONLY TAKE
A COUPLE OF MINUTES

34:53.592 --> 34:54.926
BUT IF IT WOULD BE
A LOT EASIER

34:54.960 --> 34:56.462
WE COULD COME BACK
NEXT WEEK.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.930
AH... WAIT
A MINUTE.

34:58.964 --> 35:00.899
IF I DON'T HAVE
IT FIXED NOW

35:00.932 --> 35:03.269
IT'LL BE ANOTHER
COUPLE OF WEEKS?

35:03.302 --> 35:05.003
NO... NO, NO.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.572
FIVE DAYS, MAX.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.906
FIVE DAYS?

35:07.939 --> 35:09.341
COME ON, MARIA.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.177
HOW CAN YOU RESIST HIM?

35:11.210 --> 35:12.744
OKAY, IF IT DOESN'T
TAKE TOO LONG,
COME ON IN.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.347
BE OUT OF YOUR WAY
IN JUST A SECOND.

35:15.381 --> 35:16.148
BINGO.

35:16.182 --> 35:18.250
THERE WE GO.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.118
NOT BAD FOR AN OLD FART.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.356
THERE'S ONE
PHONE OVER THERE

35:24.390 --> 35:26.492
AND ANOTHER
IN THE BEDROOM.
OKEYDOKE.

35:26.525 --> 35:29.561
I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY
AS FAST AS I CAN.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.716
Bill:
Hi, sailor.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.986
She's in the bedroom

35:55.020 --> 35:58.457
tidying up, trying to
make a good impression.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.026
Oops, don't look under the bed.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.597
Okay, okay, now--
she's coming back.

36:08.066 --> 36:09.701
OKAY.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.370
ALL CHECKED OUT HERE.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.038
WANT TO SHOW ME
THE NEXT ONE?

36:13.071 --> 36:14.273
SURE.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.654
Hi!

36:28.687 --> 36:31.022
Now a word from our
sponsors-- ( burps ).

36:31.056 --> 36:32.691
She's in the kitchen

36:32.724 --> 36:34.726
just in case
you were wondering.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.274
What's that?

36:52.411 --> 36:55.447
NOW IS NO TIME TO BE
PAUSING FOR NEWS, CHRIS.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.753
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:01.787 --> 37:03.422
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

37:03.455 --> 37:05.557
CHRIS, SHE IS IN THE HOUSE.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.527
STOP SCREWING AROUND,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.562
IF YOU BLOW THIS
AND WE GET BUSTED...

37:11.997 --> 37:13.699
Goddamn it, Chris,
come on.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.901
Stop messing around.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.803
Chris, she's...

37:17.836 --> 37:20.138
She's right there,
for Christ's sake.

37:20.171 --> 37:22.374
Chris... Chris, she's coming.

37:22.408 --> 37:23.609
Chris, she's coming.
She's coming!

37:23.642 --> 37:25.143
Chris, goddamn it!

37:25.176 --> 37:26.645
Jesus Christ!

37:26.678 --> 37:29.247
I REALLY CAN'T WAIT ANY MORE.

37:29.281 --> 37:30.749
I'M SORRY.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.751
PROBLEM?

37:32.784 --> 37:36.455
MY BROTHER IS IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.624
HE'S DOWN WITH THE POLICE

37:38.657 --> 37:39.658
AT THE
STATION

37:39.691 --> 37:42.227
AND THERE'S BAIL
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.395
SOMETHING SERIOUS?

37:43.429 --> 37:45.964
YEAH, I THINK IT IS.
COULD YOU COME BACK

37:45.997 --> 37:47.333
TOMORROW MAYBE,
OR..?

37:47.366 --> 37:48.834
I'M DONE.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.068
IT'S FIXED?

37:50.101 --> 37:51.770
THE PROBLEM ISN'T
IN THE PHONE.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.739
IT'S ON THE POLE.
I HAVE TO CHECK
OUTSIDE.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.941
OH.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.245
WELL...

38:00.278 --> 38:02.381
THANKS A LOT.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.585
I'M IN LOVE, BILL.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.286
I'M LEAVING YOU.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.856
IT HAPPENS TO ONE
OUT OF EVERY SIX MEN.

38:10.889 --> 38:14.125
I HAVE TO FACE UP
TO MY HETEROSEXUALITY.

38:14.159 --> 38:17.162
BUT DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL BE WELL PROVIDED FOR.

38:17.195 --> 38:19.264
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU DOING?

38:19.297 --> 38:20.666
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT WAS I DOING?

38:20.699 --> 38:22.267
I WAS PUTTING IN A BUG,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.002
OH, REALLY.
IS THAT WHAT THAT WAS?

38:24.035 --> 38:27.606
I DON'T CALL GOING THROUGH
THAT WOMAN'S DRAWERS
PUTTING IN A GODDAMN BUG!

38:27.639 --> 38:29.274
OH, CALM DOWN.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.177
DON'T BLOW A BOWEL.
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

38:32.210 --> 38:35.146
I THOUGHT I SAW
SOMETHING IN HER BUREAU

38:35.180 --> 38:39.150
THAT WOULD TELL
US WHETHER OR NOT
SHE TALKED TO MONTGOMERY.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.522
YEAH,
SHE'S GONE.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.824
GIVE ME THE FLASHLIGHT.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.560
I'M GOING TO GO
BACK IN THERE
AND CHECK IT OUT.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.328
COME ON.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.798
NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.299
NO?

38:54.332 --> 38:55.867
NO. CHRIS,
THIS IS THE
FEDS' PARTY.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.703
I AM NOT GONNA
GET MY ASS CANNED

38:57.736 --> 38:59.905
FOR ILLEGAL
PROCEDURE.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.040
"THIS IS THE
FEDS' PARTY.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.910
I'M NOT GONNA
GET MY ASS CANNED
FOR ILLEGAL PROCEDURE"?

39:04.943 --> 39:07.345
GIVE ME THE
GODDAMN FLASHLIGHT.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.214
NOTHING'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO YOU.

39:09.247 --> 39:12.684
THE WORST THING THEY COULD
DO TO YOU IS SUSPEND YOU
FOR, WHAT, THREE YEARS.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.420
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.155
I'M KIDDING!

39:17.188 --> 39:18.857
JESUS. THE MAN NEVER KNOWS
WHEN I'M KIDDING.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.859
I'M ONLY MAKING
A LITTLE JOKE,
A LITTLE HUMOR.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.894
WHAT A BONER.

39:34.239 --> 39:35.306
YOU THERE?

39:36.475 --> 39:37.509
YOU IN?

39:37.543 --> 39:38.677
I'M IN.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.311
Then hurry up.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.127
CAR.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.869
I'M SORRY, SORRY.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.804
Are you kidding me?

40:05.837 --> 40:08.540
You're sorry?
You're making me very nervous.

40:08.574 --> 40:11.309
I'M MAKING YOU NERVOUS?
THAT'S A HOOT.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.824
OKAY, I THINK I GOT
SOMETHING REAL IMPORTANT HERE.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.994
A bunch of letters here,
all from Montgomery

40:29.027 --> 40:32.998
and the last one's dated
about four months ago.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.666
"Dear Maria--

40:34.700 --> 40:37.235
"First you stop
coming to visit me

40:37.268 --> 40:40.405
"and now you won't
even answer my letters.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.808
"I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE LONELY.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.777
"I HEAR YOU'RE SEEING
A COUPLE OF GUYS.

40:45.811 --> 40:50.181
"SOMETIMES I GET SO MAD THAT I
COULD WIPE OUT A WHOLE PLANET

40:50.215 --> 40:52.518
AND ENJOY MYSELF DOING IT."

40:52.551 --> 40:55.487
HOW COULD SHE HAVE DUMPED
A CHARMER LIKE HIM?

40:58.657 --> 41:00.859
All right, take this down.

41:00.892 --> 41:03.695
I think we got
something to check out.

41:03.729 --> 41:07.298
He apparently has a buddy
with the initials "B.C."

41:07.332 --> 41:09.200
right here in Seattle.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.503
Seems to work on the docks.

41:11.537 --> 41:15.340
NOW HE'S TALKING
ABOUT SOME FURNITURE.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.543
He bought it for a present...

41:19.410 --> 41:21.613
Does she still have it?

41:21.647 --> 41:24.182
Apparently got it
for her birthday.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.553
It's very important to him.

41:31.389 --> 41:32.791
Holy shit!

41:32.824 --> 41:33.792
WHAT?

41:33.825 --> 41:35.160
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.962
Get out
of the fuckin' house.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.097
SHE'S RIGHT THERE.
SHE'S AT THE STAIRS.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.969
ARE YOU FUCKING
WITH ME?

41:44.002 --> 41:44.870
NO, I'M NOT
FUCKING WITH YOU!

41:44.903 --> 41:46.071
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!

42:06.558 --> 42:08.193
COME ON, CHRIS.

42:08.226 --> 42:11.029
( water running in shower )

42:18.536 --> 42:21.807
( loud music )

43:02.614 --> 43:04.582
( quietly: )
ARE YOU, CRAZY?

43:05.583 --> 43:07.118
* AT NIGHT

43:07.152 --> 43:10.822
* WHEN YOU TURN OFF
ALL THE LIGHTS *

43:10.856 --> 43:14.793
* THERE'S NO PLACE
THAT YOU CAN HIDE *

43:14.826 --> 43:16.895
* NO, NO

43:16.928 --> 43:19.597
* THE RHYTHM IS GONNA GET YOU

43:20.699 --> 43:23.334
* THE RHYTHM IS GONNA GET YOU

43:23.368 --> 43:25.637
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

43:27.639 --> 43:30.075
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

43:30.108 --> 43:32.143
* THE RHYTHM IS GONNA GET YOU

43:32.177 --> 43:33.311
* TONIGHT.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.324
* THE RHYTHM IS GONNA GET YOU

43:49.227 --> 43:50.528
* TONIGHT.

43:51.629 --> 43:52.831
AHHH...

43:53.732 --> 43:55.133
JESUS!

43:56.201 --> 43:57.535
( engine starts )

44:01.673 --> 44:04.375
( motorcycle engine revs )

44:15.086 --> 44:16.521
SERGEANT BERNIE?

44:16.554 --> 44:18.690
YEAH, THIS IS CHRIS LECCE.

44:18.724 --> 44:20.191
I'M FINE, FINE.

44:20.225 --> 44:21.526
HOW ARE YOU?

44:21.559 --> 44:23.061
GREAT.

44:23.094 --> 44:27.298
I WANT YOU TO RUN A MAKE ON
A GUY NAMED REYNALDO McGUIRE.

44:27.332 --> 44:30.568
YEAH, FIND OUT ANY PRIORS,
ANYTHING AT ALL.

44:30.601 --> 44:31.837
THANKS.

44:31.870 --> 44:34.339
OH, I'M JUST
ENJOYING MY DAY OFF.

44:34.372 --> 44:35.673
BYE.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.678
OH, COME ON.
THERE IS NO WAY, CHRIS!

44:40.712 --> 44:42.580
THERE IS NO
WAY ONE BULLET

44:42.613 --> 44:44.515
COULD HAVE DONE
ALL THAT DAMAGE.

44:44.549 --> 44:45.583
"NO WAY"?
WHAT DOES "NO WAY" MEAN ?

44:45.616 --> 44:47.652
ONE BULLET CAME FROM
THE GRASSY KNOLL

44:47.685 --> 44:50.655
THE OTHER FROM THE TEXAS
SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.091
HOW NAIVE CAN YOU BE?
YOU THINK THE CHIEF JUSTICE
OF THE UNITED STATES LIED?

44:53.124 --> 44:55.560
IS THAT RIGHT?
THAT GERALD FORD LIED?

44:56.762 --> 44:58.663
THOSE BASTARDS.
WHAT?

44:58.696 --> 45:02.033
THEY ATE EVERYTHING
AND LEFT US
A GODDAMN DOG TURD!

45:02.067 --> 45:04.069
EARL WARREN LEFT US
A DOG TURD?

45:04.102 --> 45:06.171
NO, PHIL AND JACK.

45:06.204 --> 45:07.605
WHY DO YOU CARE
ABOUT THAT STUFF?

45:07.638 --> 45:09.674
YOU WERE FIVE
YEARS OLD WHEN
IT HAPPENED.

45:09.707 --> 45:12.110
I DON'T KNOW HOW YET,
BUT I'M GOING TO GET
THOSE GUYS, MAN.

45:12.143 --> 45:14.179
GIVE ME THE KEYS
TO THE CAR. I'LL GO
TO THE SUPERMARKET.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.546
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

45:15.580 --> 45:17.215
HOW ABOUT
SOME TRUTH AND JUSTICE?

45:17.248 --> 45:18.049
WHAT ELSE?

45:18.083 --> 45:19.517
DOUGHNUTS.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.552
WHY NOT? WE'RE COPS.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.077
HI.
HI.

45:46.111 --> 45:47.745
THE PHONE MAN,
RIGHT?

45:47.779 --> 45:49.214
RIGHT, RIGHT.
HOW'S YOUR PHONE?

45:49.247 --> 45:50.715
IT STILL WORKS.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.483
DO YOU LIVE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

45:52.517 --> 45:54.452
NO, NO. I WAS IN
THE AREA WORKING.

45:54.485 --> 45:55.921
MORE LINES DOWN?

45:55.954 --> 45:57.388
ALWAYS.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.958
ARE YOU SATISFIED
WITH THE PHONE SYSTEM?

45:59.991 --> 46:02.961
YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING
ELSE INSTALLED?

46:02.994 --> 46:06.131
ANY TRIMLINE,
OR VIDEOPHONE,
OR ANYTHING AT ALL?

46:06.164 --> 46:07.799
YOU A A PHONE MAN,
AREN'T YOU?

46:07.833 --> 46:08.900
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

46:08.934 --> 46:11.002
YOU'RE STILL WORKING
ON ANOTHER LINE.

46:11.036 --> 46:12.237
GET IT?

46:12.270 --> 46:13.504
GOT IT.
GOOD.

46:13.538 --> 46:14.772
$16.13.

46:17.876 --> 46:19.945
HOPE YOUR PHONE
BREAKS REAL SOON.

46:19.978 --> 46:21.847
YOU PROMISE TO FIX IT

46:21.880 --> 46:23.081
IF IT DOES?

46:23.114 --> 46:24.382
I PROMISE.

46:25.716 --> 46:26.885
BYE.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.289
EATING IN BETWEEN MEALS?

46:32.357 --> 46:34.492
"EATING IN BETWEEN MEALS?"

46:46.171 --> 46:47.705
( thunder )

46:53.678 --> 46:55.380
WAIT A MINUTE.
DON'T GO.

46:56.681 --> 46:58.183
OH, SHIT.

46:59.584 --> 47:01.887
YOU WOULDN'T BE HEADED

47:01.920 --> 47:03.188
IN MY DIRECTION,
WOULD YOU?

47:03.221 --> 47:05.957
I'M SORRY. I DON'T
KNOW YOUR NAME.

47:05.991 --> 47:09.127
OH... UH... EH... BILL.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.161
BILL?

47:10.195 --> 47:11.062
BILL.

47:11.096 --> 47:12.030
I'M MARIA.

47:12.063 --> 47:13.364
HI.

47:13.398 --> 47:15.200
CAN I MAKE YOU A TRADE?

47:15.233 --> 47:17.202
A CUP OF COFFEE
FOR A RIDE HOME?

47:17.235 --> 47:19.070
MY BIKE HAS
THIS STUPID FLAT

47:19.104 --> 47:21.406
AND IT'S GETTING
READY TO RAIN.

47:21.439 --> 47:22.707
WELL, UH...

47:24.009 --> 47:25.676
PLEASE?

47:26.544 --> 47:28.213
YEAH, WHAT THE HELL.

47:28.246 --> 47:30.615
GOOD. THANK YOU.
WE'LL PUT IT
IN THE TRUNK.

47:43.895 --> 47:46.397
OH, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

48:10.555 --> 48:12.557
( phone rings )

48:13.791 --> 48:15.293
YEAH?

48:16.094 --> 48:17.128
HI.

48:18.463 --> 48:20.898
I'm going to be a little late.

48:20.932 --> 48:22.867
NO, NO, TAKE YOUR TIME.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.370
I'm having a cup of coffee.

48:25.403 --> 48:26.771
HAVE TWO CUPS.

48:26.804 --> 48:30.575
NOTHING GOING ON HERE--
JUST DULL OLD POLICE WORK.

48:30.608 --> 48:32.110
Hey, great.

48:32.143 --> 48:35.213
Tell me, how's that
forklift coming?

48:35.246 --> 48:37.048
HEH-HEH-HEH...

48:37.082 --> 48:39.750
I'll be about a half hour.

48:39.784 --> 48:42.153
WHERE ARE MY DOUGHNUTS,
YOU PRICK?

48:42.187 --> 48:43.921
Maybe more.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.999
YOU REALLY ARE A NICE GUY,
AREN'T YOU?

48:54.032 --> 48:55.967
DON'T SAY THAT.

48:56.001 --> 48:57.335
WHY?
YOU ARE.

48:57.368 --> 48:58.836
YOU GAVE ME A RIDE HOME.

48:58.869 --> 49:00.438
YOU'RE UNPACKING
MY GROCERIES.

49:00.471 --> 49:02.007
YOU FIXED
MY PHONE.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.741
YOU'RE NICE.

49:03.774 --> 49:06.244
I KNOW, I KNOW,
I'M NICE, I'M NICE.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.478
I HATE THAT.

49:07.512 --> 49:08.813
IT'S A CURSE.

49:08.846 --> 49:10.348
WHAT?

49:10.381 --> 49:12.617
IT'S LIKE "MEDIUM."

49:14.652 --> 49:17.522
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE... BAD.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.526
OH, THESE GO IN THE SACK.

49:21.559 --> 49:23.228
THINK BAD IS GOOD?

49:24.295 --> 49:25.463
WELL, YEAH.

49:25.496 --> 49:27.532
I ALWAYS WANTED
A LITTLE BAD.

49:27.565 --> 49:29.134
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
MAKE MY "NICE"

49:29.167 --> 49:30.435
BETTER.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.503
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING--

49:32.537 --> 49:35.173
BAD ISN'T ALL IT'S
CRACKED UP TO BE.

49:35.206 --> 49:36.607
BAD IS BAD

49:36.641 --> 49:40.545
AND I THINK RIGHT NOW I'D
SETTLE FOR A LITTLE NICE.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.381
I THINK.

49:48.019 --> 49:50.555
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

49:52.990 --> 49:54.525
DINNER.

49:54.559 --> 49:56.694
DO YOU LIKE
MEXICAN FOOD?

49:56.727 --> 49:59.964
I MADE THIS MEAN
CAMARONES VERACRUZANOS.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.366
YOU LIKE SPICY?

50:06.604 --> 50:08.206
I LOVE SPICY.

50:08.239 --> 50:11.542
GOOD. THEN YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO MARRY ME AFTER THIS.

50:17.182 --> 50:21.386
AH, CHRIS-- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

50:25.890 --> 50:27.258
OH, YEAH.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.044
AW, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

50:52.817 --> 50:54.885
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.

50:54.919 --> 50:57.188
I WAS BORN ON THE
DAY OF THE DEAD.

50:57.222 --> 50:59.590
IT'S A BIG DEAL
IN LATINO CULTURE.

50:59.624 --> 51:01.859
THEY DO IT TO
MAKE FUN OF DEATH

51:01.892 --> 51:04.462
AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
AT THE SAME TIME.

51:04.495 --> 51:07.132
SO EVERY YEAR, AS LONG
AS I CAN REMEMBER,
SOMEONE IN MY FAMILY

51:07.165 --> 51:09.567
HAS ALWAYS GIVEN ME SOME
KIND OF SKELETON

51:09.600 --> 51:10.968
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

51:11.001 --> 51:14.272
AND NOW I'VE GOT
THIS FULL GRAVEYARD.

51:16.674 --> 51:18.543
GOT A BIG FAMILY?

51:18.576 --> 51:21.546
MY YOUNGER BROTHER LIVES
AT HOME WITH MY MOM,
EXCEPT THIS WEEK

51:21.579 --> 51:23.981
AND I'VE GOT A TON OF RELATIVES

51:24.014 --> 51:25.550
IN VERACRUZ.

51:25.583 --> 51:27.385
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER--

51:27.418 --> 51:28.986
I... I HAPPEN
TO KNOW

51:29.019 --> 51:30.655
A COUPLE OF COPS.

51:30.688 --> 51:31.989
I COULD
ASK AROUND

51:32.022 --> 51:33.958
FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

51:33.991 --> 51:35.826
YOU THINK
THEY'D TELL YOU?

51:35.860 --> 51:37.562
YEAH, IF THEY WANT
THEIR PHONES TO WORK.

51:37.595 --> 51:39.664
OH, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

51:39.697 --> 51:41.098
OH,
I'M SORRY--

51:41.132 --> 51:42.967
THERE'S THAT
WORD AGAIN.

51:47.705 --> 51:49.940
I KIND OF LIKE YOUR SMILE.

51:53.544 --> 51:55.880
WELL, I MUST BE KIND OF DRUNK.

52:00.551 --> 52:02.920
MARIA, LET
ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

52:02.953 --> 52:04.522
WHAT, MR. BILL?

52:06.824 --> 52:10.495
HOW COME YOU KNOW SO
MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S BAD?

52:11.896 --> 52:13.164
WELL...

52:14.732 --> 52:16.701
THERE WAS THIS MAN ONCE

52:16.734 --> 52:18.503
AND HE WAS VIOLENT

52:18.536 --> 52:21.306
AND CRAZY, AND DANGEROUS

52:21.339 --> 52:22.973
AND I...

52:24.008 --> 52:25.376
I WAS INSANE.

52:25.410 --> 52:27.545
I WAS INSANE

52:27.578 --> 52:30.315
BECAUSE I WAS WITH
HIM FOR A WHILE.

52:30.348 --> 52:32.049
IT'S ALL
OVER NOW.

52:34.051 --> 52:35.653
DID YOU LOVE HIM?

52:37.555 --> 52:39.023
I WAS CRAZY

52:39.056 --> 52:40.325
I THINK.

52:40.358 --> 52:42.460
WHERE IS HE NOW?

52:42.493 --> 52:44.562
WHY DO YOU ASK?

52:46.163 --> 52:47.732
WHY DO YOU THINK?

52:54.605 --> 52:56.407
I THINK I
HAVE TO GO.

52:56.441 --> 52:57.975
YEAH, ME, TOO.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.810
I'VE GOT THE
LATE SHIFT.

52:59.844 --> 53:01.679
NO, NO, NO,
LEAVE THEM.

53:01.712 --> 53:04.215
I'LL DO THEM IN
A COUPLE OF YEARS.

53:06.116 --> 53:10.187
WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE BEST
THING YOU SAID TONIGHT WAS?

53:10.221 --> 53:11.522
WHAT?

53:12.890 --> 53:14.759
THAT YOU LIKED
MY SMILE.

53:14.792 --> 53:16.327
OH...

53:16.361 --> 53:18.696
I KNOW, I KNOW--
I'M NICE.

53:18.729 --> 53:20.298
I KNOW.

53:23.301 --> 53:25.370
I'M NOT THAT NICE.

53:33.077 --> 53:35.613
HONEY,
I'M HOME.

53:35.646 --> 53:39.550
I BUMPED INTO HER
AT THE GODDAMN STORE.

53:39.584 --> 53:41.552
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

53:41.586 --> 53:46.090
PRETEND I'D NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE?
HUH?

53:46.123 --> 53:49.560
ANYWAY, WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE
WATCHING THE HOUSE.

53:49.594 --> 53:51.762
SO I WAS WATCHING
THE HOUSE--

53:51.796 --> 53:53.464
FROM THE
INSIDE.

53:53.498 --> 53:54.465
NOTHING.

53:54.499 --> 53:56.133
HERE ARE YOUR DOUGHNUTS.

53:56.166 --> 53:57.635
I DIDN'T EAT ONE OF THEM,
AND THERE WAS A GLAZE ON IT
AND EVERYTHING.

53:57.668 --> 53:59.537
I GOT YOU
SOME PRINGLES
AND SOME OREOS.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.739
YOU GOING TO GET TOGETHER
WITH HER AGAIN?

54:01.772 --> 54:03.040
MAYBE GO TO..?

54:03.073 --> 54:05.610
GIVE ME A BREAK--
SHE MADE ME DINNER.

54:05.643 --> 54:07.211
THAT WAS IT.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.546
NOTHING MORE?

54:08.579 --> 54:09.680
NOTHING MORE.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.818
OKAY,
MISTER LIAR.

54:13.851 --> 54:15.553
SERGEANT
BERNIE CALLED.

54:15.586 --> 54:18.389
SAYS THAT REYNALDO
McGUIRE WAS ARRESTED

54:18.423 --> 54:21.559
ON THE 17th
FOR A "G.T.A."

54:21.592 --> 54:24.762
WOULDN'T JUST HAPPEN
TO BE ANY RELATION,
WOULD IT?

54:24.795 --> 54:27.332
GIVE ME A BREAK.
SHE TOLD ME HER
BROTHER WAS IN JAIL.

54:27.365 --> 54:29.900
I CHECKED IT OUT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A LEAD.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.268
A LEAD?

54:31.302 --> 54:33.103
YEAH, A LEAD.

54:33.137 --> 54:36.173
FINE. YOU TELL ME YOU'RE
CHECKING OUT A LEAD.

54:36.206 --> 54:38.008
I'M GONNA BELIEVE
YOU'RE...

54:38.042 --> 54:39.344
CHECKING OUT A LEAD.

54:39.377 --> 54:42.179
I REALIZE THIS IS
A SHIT DETAIL.

54:42.212 --> 54:43.514
OH, BOY!

54:43.548 --> 54:45.149
I MEAN, CAN WE TALK?

54:45.182 --> 54:48.586
NOBODY'S GONNA CARE
WHAT WE DO HERE.
BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.

54:48.619 --> 54:50.355
BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE

54:50.388 --> 54:53.190
THAT YOU NOT ACT LIKE
A WALKING HARD-ON

54:53.223 --> 54:54.992
WHILE WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

54:55.025 --> 54:56.327
EXCUSE ME.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.465
SUCCINCTLY PUT.

55:13.978 --> 55:16.614
ALL THE MONEY IN
THE CASH REGISTER,
RIGHT NOW.

55:16.647 --> 55:20.885
Cashier:
OKAY, OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.

55:23.688 --> 55:25.055
REACH UP AND GET ME

55:25.089 --> 55:27.257
A HUNTING KNIFE,
WOULD YOU PLEASE?

55:47.845 --> 55:49.346
SORRY, WE'RE CLOSED.

56:07.297 --> 56:08.733
72...

56:08.766 --> 56:10.267
WHAT'VE WE GOT?

56:10.300 --> 56:11.502
$273.

56:11.536 --> 56:12.770
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S PLENTY.
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

56:12.803 --> 56:14.705
ALL WE NEED
IS GAS MONEY.

56:14.739 --> 56:17.608
IT'S HARDLY WORTH
RUBBING PEOPLE OUT FOR.

56:17.642 --> 56:18.776
WHAT?

56:18.809 --> 56:20.110
NOTHING.

56:29.086 --> 56:30.788
WHAT DID
I DO NOW?

56:32.389 --> 56:34.191
REYNALDO, ISN'T IT?

56:34.224 --> 56:35.593
RAY.

56:37.462 --> 56:40.698
I HEARD YOU GOT YOURSELF
INTO A LITTLE TROUBLE.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.332
YOU A COP?

56:43.300 --> 56:44.602
YOU A CRIMINAL?

56:44.635 --> 56:46.036
NO.

56:46.070 --> 56:49.540
THIS GIRL'S FATHER'S
GOT IT IN FOR ME.

56:49.574 --> 56:50.975
HE DOES?

56:52.610 --> 56:54.111
WHY?

56:54.144 --> 56:57.715
DOESN'T WANT
ME SEEING HIS
DAUGHTER.

56:57.748 --> 56:59.850
SHE'S PRETTY
PRECIOUS, HUH?

57:00.985 --> 57:02.487
YEAH.

57:02.520 --> 57:05.322
WHY DID YOU HOT-WIRE THE CAR?

57:06.791 --> 57:09.293
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OKAY.

57:12.129 --> 57:13.764
I WAS STUPID.

57:16.701 --> 57:20.004
IT'S NOT VERY PLEASANT
BEING IN HERE, IS IT?

57:20.037 --> 57:21.839
WHY DO YOU CARE?

57:21.872 --> 57:23.741
I JUST WANT
TO FIND OUT

57:23.774 --> 57:25.943
WHAT KIND OF
A GUY YOU ARE

57:25.976 --> 57:27.878
BEFORE I
GET YOU OUT.

57:29.313 --> 57:30.481
GET ME OUT.

57:30.515 --> 57:33.651
I CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER
NIGHT IN THIS PLACE.

57:35.820 --> 57:38.155
YOU LIKE TO WORK
WITH YOUR HANDS?

57:38.188 --> 57:40.424
I'VE GOT A JOB HERE.
CONSTRUCTION.

57:40.457 --> 57:42.527
STARTS MONDAY MORNING,
7:30 TO 5:00

57:42.560 --> 57:44.161
FIVE DAYS A WEEK.

57:44.194 --> 57:46.363
GOT TO BE HOME
EVERY NIGHT.

57:46.396 --> 57:47.965
THAT'S THE DEAL.

57:49.233 --> 57:50.367
EVERY NIGHT.

57:50.400 --> 57:52.637
TAKE IT AND YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

57:52.670 --> 57:55.139
MESS WITH ME
AND YOU'RE BACK IN.

57:55.172 --> 57:56.707
WHAT DO
YOU SAY?

57:57.842 --> 57:58.876
DEAL.

58:01.679 --> 58:02.713

OH, OH... THAT.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:32.843
What do you mean, "Oh, that"?
It was a very good thing what
you and your police friend did.

01:03:32.877 --> 01:03:36.213
My brother's out of jail,
he's got a new job.

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:38.348
My mother wants to marry you.

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:40.617

MARIA, THERE ARE THINGS
ABOUT ME THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:09.146
THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT ME

ISN'T THAT WHY PEOPLE GO OUT?

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:10.414
YEAH, THEY DO.

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:13.017
BUT THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT ME

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.052
THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:17.021

01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:33.970
WHAT'S UP?
I'M LOOKING
FOR MY WIFE.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.971
WHERE DID YOU
LEAVE HER, PAL?

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:36.872
SHE'S HERE.

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.207
HE THINKS HE CAN
BARGE RIGHT IN HERE.

01:09:38.242 --> 01:09:39.209
SHE RAN OUT.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:41.211
SHE'S HIDING!

01:09:41.245 --> 01:09:43.479
IS SHE HERE?
NO. THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO TELL HIM.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:44.747
I THINK MAYBE

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:46.515
YOU MADE
A MISTAKE.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.184
GO TO HELL!

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:51.255
LET'S CALL THE COPS.
I WANT HIM OUT OF MY HOUSE.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.522
I WANT YOU TO CALL--

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:53.590
WHY DON'T I HELP YOU
LOOK FOR HER?

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.158
HEY, GAIL?

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.192
GAIL?

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:57.193
OW!

01:09:57.227 --> 01:10:00.029
OH, GEE, I'M
REAL SORRY.

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:01.164
JUST RELAX.
CALM DOWN.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.833
THERE'S A CHAIR
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:06.303
WHEN I LIFT YOU UP,
YOU'LL PUT YOUR ASS
RIGHT DOWN IN IT.

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:14.210
YOU'RE DOING OKAY.

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:16.513
WE'RE DOING JUST FINE.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:17.947
NOW, YOUR KNEE'S
BAD, HUH?

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:19.916
THAT'S IT,
JUST RELAX.

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:23.420
WE'LL GET YOU
SOME ICE FOR THE KNEE,
AND SOME ASPIRIN FOR THE HEAD.

01:10:23.453 --> 01:10:25.355
COULD WE HAVE
ASPIRIN, AND ICE?

01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:26.623
YEAH.

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:28.091
WE'RE DOING OKAY.
WE'RE DOING FINE.

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:31.361
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
TALK TO GAIL RIGHT NOW

01:10:31.395 --> 01:10:33.363
BECAUSE YOU'VE
BEEN DRINKING

01:10:33.397 --> 01:10:35.031
AND YOU SAY
MEAN THINGS

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:37.667
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN
DRINKING, RIGHT?

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.070
THANK YOU.

01:10:41.104 --> 01:10:42.406
THANKS A LOT.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.207
( opens aspirin bottle )

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.709
WHAT'S YOUR DRINK?

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.311
LITTLE RYE AND COKE.

01:10:47.344 --> 01:10:48.445
RYE AND COKE?

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:50.647
THAT USED TO BE MY DRINK.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.482
GIVE ME
YOUR HAND.

01:10:52.516 --> 01:10:55.652
I USED TO GET
DIAMOND SPLINTER
HEADACHES

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.454
RIGHT BETWEEN MY EYES--
MURDEROUS.

01:10:57.487 --> 01:10:59.323
EVER GET THOSE THINGS?

01:10:59.356 --> 01:11:00.790
NO.

01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:02.258
NO?

01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:05.261
I GUESS IT MUST
HAVE BEEN ME.

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:07.130
WE'RE DOING OKAY.

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:10.066
WE'RE
DOING FINE.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.068
HOW ABOUT SOME COFFEE?

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:14.070
YEAH, COFFEE'S GOOD.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.072
YEAH, WE'LL HAVE COFFEE,
WE'LL CALM DOWN,
TALK ABOUT GAIL.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.542
CAN WE HAVE SOME
COFFEE, PLEASE?

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.277
SURE.

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:37.527
* WHERE DO WE BEGIN?...

01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:40.196
I'M IMPRESSED.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:42.632
I WAS JUST IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:45.535
I'M BEGINNING TO LIKE
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
MORE AND MORE.

01:11:45.569 --> 01:11:49.005
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED
AFTER THAT PHONE CALL.

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:52.609
YEAH, I WAS KIND
OF OUT OF IT.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:56.045
BUT I GUESS THIS ISN'T
THE BEST TIME, HUH?

01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:57.046
UH-UH.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.515
A DATE'S A DATE.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:01.818
LOOK, MARIA, I'M...
I'M REALLY INVOLVED...

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:05.455
* THERE'S NOTHING
TO FEAR, BABY *

01:12:05.489 --> 01:12:07.491
* NOW THAT YOU'RE NEAR ME.

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:12.061
* I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
SO CLEARLY. *

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:16.366
OH, BOY.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.169
* THIS NIGHT WAS MADE
FOR ONE THING ONLY *

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:24.508
* TO COME AS CLOSE
AS WE CAN COME *

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:29.012
* THIS NIGHT WAS MADE
FOR ONE THING ONLY *

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:33.883
* IT'S SUCH A CHANGE--
SOMEONE NICE LIKE YOU. *

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:35.385
OH, BOY.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.724
I'M IN OVER MY HEAD HERE.

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:41.891
STAY WITH ME.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:43.292
MARIA...

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:48.364
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
BREAK MY PHONE, DO YOU?

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:51.568
IF I DO, THEY'LL SEND
SOMEBODY ELSE HERE.

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.715
OH, BILL.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:07.717
FUCK BILL.

01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:10.286
* ...FOR ONE THING ONLY

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:15.058
* TO COME AS CLOSE
AS WE CAN COME. *

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:19.362
* THIS NIGHT WAS MADE
FOR ONE THING ONLY *

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:22.298
* TO COME AS CLOSE
AS WE CAN COME. *

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:26.402
* WHERE DO WE BEGIN?

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:30.807
* YOU COULD JUST HOLD ME.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.944
* WHERE DO WE BEGIN?

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:39.215
* YOU COULD JUST HOLD ME.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.818
* WHERE DO WE BEGIN?

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.343
GOD!

01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:44.173
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:46.442
I HAD A BAD DREAM.

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:48.077
OH.

01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:50.580
OH.

01:15:50.614 --> 01:15:52.381
SCARY MONSTERS.

01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:55.051
WHERE DID
THEY GET YOU?

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:56.419
HERE?

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.488
HERE.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.986
WHAT TIME IS IT?

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:31.287
7:30.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.789
JESUS CHRIST!

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:36.192
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:39.228
IT'S MORNING.

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:40.764
ARE YOU GOING TO
BE LATE FOR WORK?

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:42.098
UH-HUH.

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.167
COULD YOU TELL THEM
YOU'LL BE A LITTLE LATE?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.368
MM-MM. MM-MM.

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:56.846
LISTEN, YOU THINK YOU
COULD LEND ME A HAT?

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.015
- A HAT?
- YEAH, A HAT.

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:02.485
I GOT THIS BAD SKIN CONDITION
AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS
FOR ME TO GO OUT IN THE SUN.

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:03.419
LIKE A RASH?

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:04.688
YEAH, YEAH,
LIKE A RASH

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:06.355
BUT IT'S WORSE.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:09.292
OH. IS THIS ONE
OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T
WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT?

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:10.293
NO, NO, NO.

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:12.295
NO, IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:13.863
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS.

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:22.806
I'M NOT SURE
IT'S YOUR COLOR.

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:27.243
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.048
- MUCH BETTER.
- THANK YOU.

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:34.350
WAIT, WAIT.

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:36.485
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT...

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:41.524
I REALLY GOT YOU
THINKING NOW, DON'T I?

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.727
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.795
COULD I BORROW THIS?

01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:46.730
IT'S YOURS.

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:58.742
WHAT ARE YOU WAVING AT, HUH?

01:17:58.775 --> 01:17:59.876
WHO YOU WAVING AT?

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:02.378
( Winston barks and whines )

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:03.880
JACK-- THIS MAY BE HIM.

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:05.381
GET ON THAT HORN, HUH?

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:06.883
OH, RIGHT.

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:08.551
GET ON
THAT HORN.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:13.322
LYNN-- JACK PISMO,
SPECK ROAD STAKEOUT.

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:15.358
WE HAVE A MAN RUNNING
FROM THE HOUSE.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:17.193
Phil:
CAUCASIAN, ABOUT FIVE-TEN.

01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:20.196
JEANS, JACKET, PINK HAT,
AND HE'S HEADING SOUTH.

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:22.766
CAUCASIAN, FIVE-TEN,
JEANS, JACKET...

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:24.233
PINK HAT?

01:18:24.267 --> 01:18:25.534
YEAH, AND A SHAWL.

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:27.070
HE'S HEADING SOUTH.

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:30.273
( high voice: )
EXCUSE ME!

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:32.275
MY FAULT, MY FAULT, SORRY.

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:33.877
( sirens )

01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:56.432
NO! NO! BACK IT UP!

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:00.804
ASSHOLE.

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:57.994
( dog growling )

01:20:09.372 --> 01:20:10.573
GET AWAY FROM ME!

01:20:11.374 --> 01:20:12.375
GET DOWN.

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:13.509
GET AWAY FROM ME.

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.477
GET DOWN!

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.051
WHOA--

01:20:22.085 --> 01:20:23.019
WHOA!

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:24.420
( yells )

01:20:29.692 --> 01:20:30.860
COME ON, COME ON!

01:20:30.894 --> 01:20:32.728
GET IN!

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.015
DID WE PRACTICE
SAFE SEX?

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:59.088
Chris: Hello?
Maria: Hi. It's Maria.

01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:00.689
Chris:
Hi, hi.

01:21:00.723 --> 01:21:02.191
What's wrong?

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:04.327
Maria:
Did I wake you?

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.729
Chris: No, no, no.

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:07.931
It's okay.

01:21:07.964 --> 01:21:09.432
Where are you?

01:21:09.465 --> 01:21:11.034
Maria: At home.
Listen to me, fella.

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:13.937
Just because you're having
a little bit of trouble

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.338
doesn't mean I'm going
to let you off the hook...

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:18.041
Chris:
Holy shit!

01:21:18.074 --> 01:21:20.243
( exaggerated coughing )

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:29.418
( Chris, disguised: )
I can't talk now.

01:21:29.452 --> 01:21:31.387
I have to call you back.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.289
Maria:
Is it the police?

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:34.190
( dial tone )

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:36.625
Maria:
Hello? Bill?

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:40.196
WE ALSO HAVE A VIDEOTAPE

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:41.931
OF A MAN LEAVING

01:21:41.965 --> 01:21:43.933
THE SPECK ROAD HOUSE.

01:21:43.967 --> 01:21:47.203
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
THE MAN ON THE PHONE

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.872
OR IF HE HAS ANY RELATIONSHIP

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:51.707
WITH MONTGOMERY.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.978
WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:57.981
WE ALSO FOUND THIS.

01:22:05.488 --> 01:22:07.256
"BILL"?

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:09.292
MAN, THAT'S THE LAST
FUCKIN' STRAW.

01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:11.627
YOU BREAK IT...

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.262
NIGHT.

01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:17.266
HEY, HEY--
I'M SERIOUS, MAN.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.102
IT ENDS RIGHT HERE.

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:20.936
EITHER YOU BREAK IT OFF,
OR GET YOUR ASS REASSIGNED

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:23.272
'CAUSE I AM NOT
GOING DOWN WITH YOU!

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:25.274
I BUSTED MY ASS TO MAKE
DETECTIVE BEFORE 30.

01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:28.077
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
FUCK THAT UP!

01:22:28.111 --> 01:22:29.712
YOU GOT THAT, CHRIS?

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:34.350
YEAH, I GOT THAT.

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:43.092
YOU USED TO BE A
HELL OF A COP, MAN.

01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:45.294
GET YOUR SHIT
TOGETHER.

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:57.640
AH.

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:04.280
UH-OH, BACON
ON THE LEFT.

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:06.482
BACON BURGERS
ON THE LEFT.

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:08.184
GREAT.

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:09.618
DAMN IT!

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.720
ALL RIGHT--
GET IN THE BACK.

01:23:11.754 --> 01:23:13.322
USE THE SHOTGUN.

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:15.358
I'M NOT SHOOTING
AT COPS!

01:23:15.391 --> 01:23:17.026
GET IN THE BACK, MAN.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.527
HOW FAR

01:23:18.561 --> 01:23:21.030
ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE THIS?

01:23:21.064 --> 01:23:22.665
( siren )

01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:39.348
YEAH!

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:11.247
( car horn )

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:19.322
WATCH THIS.

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.795
OH, YEAH!

01:24:26.829 --> 01:24:28.464
( Stick laughs )

01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:30.333
( car horn )

01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:34.903
AAH!

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:38.441
( horns )

01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:43.512
HANG ON, I'M GOING TO JAM THEM.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:24:59.662
YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:00.729
NO.

01:25:00.763 --> 01:25:02.531
JUST HANG IN
THERE.

01:25:21.684 --> 01:25:23.552
( sirens )

01:25:31.294 --> 01:25:32.661
OH, FUCK.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:34.830
IT'S OVER, MAN.

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:36.899
IT'S OVER!

01:25:41.404 --> 01:25:44.840
IT'S NEVER OVER
TILL IT'S OVER.

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:46.442
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN!

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.577
IT'S GOT TO STOP, MAN.

01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:57.019
WHOA.

01:25:57.052 --> 01:25:58.421
WHOA!

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:29.318
HOPE THIS ROAD
GOES SOMEWHERE.

01:26:29.352 --> 01:26:30.753
WE'RE NEVER GONNA
GET OUT OF THIS!

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.393
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

01:27:44.427 --> 01:27:45.928
WE'RE BLOWING THIS POP STAND.

01:27:45.961 --> 01:27:46.929
IT'S OVER.

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:48.931
THEY GOT MONTGOMERY?

01:27:48.964 --> 01:27:50.966
YEAH, A COUPLE
HOURS AGO.

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.968
DIDN'T GET MANY DETAILS, BUT
THERE WAS SOME BIG SHOOTOUT.

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.337
THE CAR ENDED UP

01:27:54.370 --> 01:27:55.471
IN THE NASQUALE RIVER

01:27:55.504 --> 01:27:57.506
AND NO ONE
CAME OUT.

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:01.510
SO, WE GET A PAT ON THE BACK--
JOB WELL DONE--

01:28:01.544 --> 01:28:03.546
NEXT CASE.

01:28:14.723 --> 01:28:17.626
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE
ONE LUCKY SON OF A BITCH.

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:31.139
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT HER?

01:28:31.173 --> 01:28:32.841
OH, MAN, I...

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.777
I THINK I LOVE HER.

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:36.011
I REALLY DO.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:38.514
I'D HATE TO THINK
YOU RISKED IT ALL

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:40.516
JUST BECAUSE
YOU LIKED HER.

01:28:40.549 --> 01:28:42.551
YEAH, YEAH.

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:46.855
NOW COMES THE
HARD PART.

01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:48.524
SAY, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT GOING ACROSS THE STREET

01:28:48.557 --> 01:28:50.693
AND TELLING HER THAT I'M A COP,
NOT A PHONE MAN

01:28:50.726 --> 01:28:52.861
AND I'VE BEEN LYING TO HER
AND I'VE BEEN TAKING
PICTURES

01:28:52.895 --> 01:28:54.229
AND LOOKING AT HER
THROUGH TELESCOPES...

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:55.364
MM-MM. NO.

01:28:55.398 --> 01:28:57.966
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D LIKE THAT.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.670
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE YO THAT SCREWED UP.

01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:04.873
WELL, MAYBE I'LL LEARN
FROM YOUR MISTAKES.

01:29:04.907 --> 01:29:06.341
PROBABLY NOT.
PROBABLY NOT.

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:07.510
NO.

01:29:07.543 --> 01:29:08.677
WISH ME LUCK.

01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:09.912
GOOD LUCK.

01:29:13.382 --> 01:29:17.386
The force of the water against
the car is making it difficult
to pull it from the river.

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:20.088
It is not yet confirmed
but it is believed

01:29:20.122 --> 01:29:22.224
that the body of
escaped prisoner

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:25.428
Richard "Stick" Montgomery
is still trapped inside.

01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:27.730
The body of his cousin,
Caylor Reese

01:29:27.763 --> 01:29:29.765
was found
two miles downriver.

01:29:29.798 --> 01:29:31.333
HI.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:33.536
Normally, police divers

01:29:33.569 --> 01:29:36.238
would have tried to
pull Montgomery free

01:29:36.271 --> 01:29:38.373
but that has not been possible.

01:29:38.407 --> 01:29:39.908
( TV off )

01:29:41.544 --> 01:29:43.278
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:29:47.282 --> 01:29:48.551
I KNOW.

01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:50.085
I KNOW.

01:30:01.764 --> 01:30:03.932
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK.

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:07.870
YOU'RE WANTED

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:09.538
BY THE LAW,
AREN'T YOU?

01:30:09.572 --> 01:30:11.273
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

01:30:12.441 --> 01:30:14.810
I HEARD SIRENS
THIS MORNING

01:30:14.843 --> 01:30:16.612
AFTER YOU LEFT.

01:30:16.645 --> 01:30:20.683
THE POLICE
FOLLOW YOU HERE?

01:30:23.318 --> 01:30:25.287
I DON'T THINK
I REALIZED

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.824
THE SIZE OF THE HOLE
THAT I DUG FOR MYSELF.

01:30:28.857 --> 01:30:30.859
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
ARE YOU IN?

01:30:35.598 --> 01:30:37.966
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO LIKE ME VERY MUCH

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.635
WHEN I TELL YOU THIS.

01:30:39.668 --> 01:30:42.638
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LET THIS HAPPEN.

01:30:44.039 --> 01:30:45.574
BUT I DID.

01:30:45.608 --> 01:30:47.075
I WANT YOU
TO KNOW

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:49.311
BEFORE YOU
START HATING ME--

01:30:49.344 --> 01:30:51.680
AND YOU WILL
START HATING ME--

01:30:51.714 --> 01:30:53.816
THAT I'VE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:54.883
DON'T, DON'T.

01:30:56.885 --> 01:30:59.888
DON'T INTERRUPT
A CONFESSION.

01:31:08.564 --> 01:31:10.198
I DON'T WORK

01:31:10.232 --> 01:31:12.267
FOR THE
PHONE COMPANY.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.336
AND MY NAME
IS NOT BILL.

01:31:14.369 --> 01:31:16.171
IT'S CHRIS.

01:31:17.673 --> 01:31:19.107
YOU'RE A COP?

01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:20.676
I'M A DETECTIVE.

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:25.180
I'M STAKING OUT THE HOME
OF AN EX-GIRLFRIEND

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:27.482
OF AN ESCAPED
FEDERAL PRISONER.

01:31:27.516 --> 01:31:30.485
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME?

01:31:32.154 --> 01:31:33.055
FROM WHERE?

01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:36.559
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:45.534
AND MY PHONES?

01:31:51.073 --> 01:31:52.340
MARIA!

01:31:54.176 --> 01:31:55.944
Chris:
LISTEN TO ME!

01:31:59.047 --> 01:32:00.415
FROM THERE?

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:02.851
UH-OH...

01:32:05.754 --> 01:32:07.122
MARIA!

01:32:13.929 --> 01:32:16.231
WHAT DO YOU
GOT THERE?

01:32:38.253 --> 01:32:39.421
WELL...

01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:45.293
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.

01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:51.967
I HOPE I DIDN'T DISAPPOINT YOU.

01:32:59.274 --> 01:33:00.943
Chris:
MARIA!

01:33:00.976 --> 01:33:03.078
MARIA! DAMN IT.

01:33:03.111 --> 01:33:04.479
MARIA, LISTEN!

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:05.814
HOLD IT
A MINUTE.

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:09.551
LISTEN TO ME!

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:13.488
I WAS DOING MY JOB,
GODDAMN IT!

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:16.625
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR WHETHER I LIKE IT
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

01:33:16.659 --> 01:33:18.994
THERE WASN'T
ANY FUN IN IT.

01:33:19.027 --> 01:33:22.731
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
YOU AND ME WAS...

01:33:22.765 --> 01:33:24.166
WAS NOT PART OF IT.

01:33:24.199 --> 01:33:26.268
IT WAS MY MISTAKE.

01:33:29.271 --> 01:33:30.773
MARIA...

01:33:35.878 --> 01:33:37.646
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.214
I JUST COULDN'T.

01:33:43.551 --> 01:33:44.853
SON OF A BITCH.

01:34:15.718 --> 01:34:16.719
( screams )

01:34:21.323 --> 01:34:23.091
YOU BROKE MY HEART

01:34:29.331 --> 01:34:31.566
THEY SAID YOU WERE DEAD.

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:33.535
OH...

01:34:46.614 --> 01:34:50.018
JESUS CHRIST.

01:34:50.052 --> 01:34:52.520
I MADE IT.

01:34:52.554 --> 01:34:54.022
I MADE IT!

01:34:54.056 --> 01:34:56.691
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
I MADE IT!

01:34:56.725 --> 01:34:58.861
Chris:
MARIA, WOULD YOU JUST
THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE?

01:34:58.894 --> 01:35:01.596
LISTEN TO ME.
WHO THE FUCK IS THAT?

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:02.765
OKAY?

01:35:02.798 --> 01:35:05.333
I COULDN'T TELL YOU
THAT I WAS...

01:35:05.367 --> 01:35:07.102
DON'T!

01:35:07.135 --> 01:35:09.237
YOU COULDN'T TELL
HER YOU WERE WHAT?

01:35:13.475 --> 01:35:15.277
YOU COULDN'T TELL
HER YOU WERE WHAT?

01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:18.646
WHO IS THIS GUY?

01:35:20.615 --> 01:35:22.250
YOU...

01:35:22.284 --> 01:35:24.186
IS THIS
THE GUY?

01:35:24.219 --> 01:35:26.755
IS THIS
THE REASON?

01:35:28.623 --> 01:35:32.427
YOU WANT TO TAKE A WALK
IN THE OTHER ROOM,
PRETTY PLEASE?

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.398
TAKE A FUCKIN' WALK.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:59.788
CHRISTOPHER...

01:35:59.822 --> 01:36:01.389
CHRISTOPHER "LEE-CHEE"?

01:36:01.423 --> 01:36:02.757
LECCE.

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:04.159
LEE-CHEE.

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:08.630
SO "LEE-CHEE,"
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
BOTHERING MY OLD LADY?

01:36:08.663 --> 01:36:10.933
WE HAD A FIGHT.
OH, YOU HAD A FIGHT?

01:36:10.966 --> 01:36:12.634
THAT'S TOO BAD.
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?

01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:14.436
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:16.671
WATCH IT, PAL.

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:18.473
IT IS ALL MY BUSINESS.

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:19.641
NOW WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?

01:36:19.674 --> 01:36:22.477
SHE FOUND OUT I WAS
VIOLATING MY PAROLE, OKAY?

01:36:25.948 --> 01:36:28.550
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:35.257
WHAT KIND
OF CANDY-ASS CRIME
DID YOU COMMIT, CHRIS?

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:37.525
DID YOU STEAL
SOME OLD LADY'S HANDBAG?

01:36:37.559 --> 01:36:40.028
WHAT DID
YOU DO?

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:43.365
TAKE IT EASY.
TAKE IT EASY.

01:36:43.398 --> 01:36:46.668
DON'T TELL ME
TO TAKE IT EASY.

01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:48.536
WHAT DID YOU DO?

01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:51.239

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.709

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.567
WALLA WALLA.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.242
I SAID

01:37:32.948 --> 01:37:35.283
( scraping )

01:37:39.554 --> 01:37:41.423
YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

01:37:41.456 --> 01:37:44.626
NO, MAN, I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

01:37:47.029 --> 01:37:48.563
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:50.865
WHAT THE HELL
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

01:37:50.899 --> 01:37:53.201
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW

01:37:53.235 --> 01:37:55.770
WHAT THESE THINGS
WERE STUFFED WITH.

01:37:59.074 --> 01:38:01.443
THEY'RE MADE
OF MONEY!

01:38:01.476 --> 01:38:04.646
SHE'S SAFER THAN
A BANK, CHRIS.

01:38:12.087 --> 01:38:14.056
I HAD FRIENDS
AT WALLA WALLA.

01:38:14.089 --> 01:38:15.557
YOU KNOW
CLETUS INK?

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:20.528
NOPE.

01:38:20.562 --> 01:38:21.629
YOU DON'T?

01:38:21.663 --> 01:38:24.199

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:29.037
NO, I DON'T,
BUT IT WAS A BIG PLACE.

01:38:29.071 --> 01:38:32.640
YOU DON'T KNOW CLETUS INK,
YOU DON'T KNOW MAD DOG ROSS?

01:38:32.674 --> 01:38:34.076
WHO THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW?

01:38:41.583 --> 01:38:44.252
DO YOU KNOW EDDIE GANT?

01:38:48.623 --> 01:38:50.792
YEAH, I DID KNOW EDDIE GANT.

01:38:50.825 --> 01:38:53.095
WHAT WAS HE IN FOR?

01:38:56.631 --> 01:38:58.600
HE KILLED A COP.

01:39:01.169 --> 01:39:02.570
HELLO?

01:39:02.604 --> 01:39:03.638

GUESS WHO THIS IS?

01:39:05.373 --> 01:39:07.175
YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:39:07.209 --> 01:39:09.111
SHUT UP FOR
A SECOND.

01:39:09.144 --> 01:39:10.512
I CAN ONLY SAY

01:39:10.545 --> 01:39:13.348
THAT THE REPORTS
OF MY DEMISE

01:39:13.381 --> 01:39:15.183
HAVE BEEN GREATLY
EXAGGERATED.

01:39:15.217 --> 01:39:17.885
WHEREVER WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,
WE HAVE TO DO THIS NOW.

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:25.860
UH-HUH.

01:39:28.163 --> 01:39:29.264
YEAH.

01:39:29.297 --> 01:39:32.367
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
IN 20 MINUTES.

01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:36.138
PACK A BAG.

01:39:36.171 --> 01:39:38.206
WE'RE TAKING A TRIP.

01:39:41.143 --> 01:39:42.844
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

01:39:42.877 --> 01:39:44.179
THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE.

01:39:47.382 --> 01:39:49.684
YOU! GET OUT
THE FRONT DOOR!

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:51.219
JUST RELAX, MAN.
GET OUT THE
FRONT DOOR!

01:39:51.253 --> 01:39:53.121
I'M NOT IN THIS!

01:39:53.155 --> 01:39:54.556
GET OUT.

01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:56.191
GET OUT!

01:39:57.092 --> 01:39:59.061
I WILL BE BACK.

01:40:26.554 --> 01:40:27.722
OH, SHIT!

01:40:29.257 --> 01:40:30.125
JESUS CHRIST.

01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:46.874
WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON?

01:40:46.908 --> 01:40:48.276
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:49.611
TAKE IT EASY.

01:40:49.644 --> 01:40:52.214
GET HIM INSIDE.

01:40:52.247 --> 01:40:54.749
THROW HIM ON
THE COUCH.

01:40:57.919 --> 01:40:59.587
A COP.

01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:01.389
I KNEW IT.

01:41:05.227 --> 01:41:06.194
WHAT THE HELL...

01:41:06.228 --> 01:41:07.595
SHUT UP

01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:08.696
PIG!

01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:10.398
BACK OFF.

01:41:10.432 --> 01:41:12.700
HOW DID YOU KNOW

01:41:12.734 --> 01:41:14.302
I WAS HERE?

01:41:14.336 --> 01:41:15.537
HOW DID YOU KNOW

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:17.205
I WAS HERE?!

01:41:17.239 --> 01:41:20.508
YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER ME?
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR MAMA.

01:41:21.976 --> 01:41:22.710
RICHARD, DON'T!

01:41:22.744 --> 01:41:23.611
HE WASN'T

01:41:23.645 --> 01:41:25.280
FOLLOWING YOU.

01:41:25.313 --> 01:41:26.914
HE WAS FOLLOWING ME.

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:28.883
WHAT?

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.051
YEAH.

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:32.620
I VIOLATED MY PAROLE, REMEMBER?

01:41:32.654 --> 01:41:35.390
HE'S BEEN
FOLLOWING ME

01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:36.391
FOR A WEEK.

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:38.393
YOU DON'T DO YOUR
JOB VERY WELL.

01:41:38.426 --> 01:41:40.895
I GOT A CAR RIGHT OUTSIDE.

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:42.564
I CAN DRIVE YOU

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:44.566
TO WHEREVER
YOU WANT TO GO.

01:41:44.599 --> 01:41:46.334
CUFF HIS HANDS
BEHIND HIM.

01:41:46.368 --> 01:41:47.835
IF HE GETS LOOSE

01:41:47.869 --> 01:41:49.504
YOU DIE.

01:41:49.537 --> 01:41:51.906
YOU MAY THINK SERVING TIME
AND HAVING COPS ON YOUR ASS
GIVES ME A REASON

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:54.509
TO TRUST YOU,
BUT LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING, PAL.

01:41:54.542 --> 01:41:57.979
THE LAST PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD I TRUST
ARE EX-CONS. LET'S MOVE.

01:42:05.887 --> 01:42:08.190
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THIS GUY?

01:42:08.223 --> 01:42:09.857
I MEAN, REALLY.

01:42:09.891 --> 01:42:13.161
WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH THIS GUY?

01:42:13.195 --> 01:42:16.331
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHO HE IS.

01:42:16.364 --> 01:42:19.167
Stick:
ISN'T LOVE
GREAT, CHRIS?

01:42:19.201 --> 01:42:21.102
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE A GOD

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:24.706
THE NEXT MINUTE, YOU'RE
A SCUM-SUCKING PIG.

01:42:32.314 --> 01:42:33.848
I'M LEAVING
THE COUNTRY, BABY.

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.016
YOU'RE GOING WITH ME.

01:42:35.049 --> 01:42:36.684
YOU GOING TO CANADA?

01:42:36.718 --> 01:42:38.720
ARE YOU A
TRAVEL AGENT?

01:42:38.753 --> 01:42:40.087
DRIVE, SUCKER.

01:42:53.901 --> 01:42:55.403
Stick:
GET OUT.

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:20.528
SIT DOWN.

01:43:22.264 --> 01:43:23.365
SIT DOWN.

01:43:23.398 --> 01:43:24.432
HEY!

01:43:24.466 --> 01:43:25.767
SHUT UP!

01:43:28.736 --> 01:43:30.272
COME HERE.

01:43:30.305 --> 01:43:32.440
I GOT TO TALK
TO THIS GUY

01:43:32.474 --> 01:43:34.376
FOR ABOUT
FIVE MINUTES.

01:43:34.409 --> 01:43:36.244
COULD YOU TAKE A WALK
AND COME BACK
IN FIVE MINUTES?

01:43:36.278 --> 01:43:37.312
WHAT FOR?

01:43:40.748 --> 01:43:42.684
JUST TAKE
A WALK.

01:43:42.717 --> 01:43:44.386
YOU'RE GONNA KILL THEM,
AREN'T YOU?

01:43:44.419 --> 01:43:47.722
I'M NOT GOING TO
MAKE LOVE TO THEM.

01:43:47.755 --> 01:43:49.591
YOU EXPECT ME TO GO WITH YOU
AFTER YOU DO THIS?

01:43:49.624 --> 01:43:51.526
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, LET THEM GO?

01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:53.361
DO I LOOK STUPID?

01:43:53.395 --> 01:43:55.196
IF I LET
THEM GO

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.198
I AM DEAD.

01:43:57.231 --> 01:43:59.200
HOW LONG
DO YOU THINK

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:00.702
IT'S GONNA TAKE
FOR THEM

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:03.237
TO PICK ME UP
IF I LET THEM GO?

01:44:03.271 --> 01:44:05.273
THEY'RE GOING TO DIE,
NOT ME.

01:44:05.307 --> 01:44:09.143
WHY?
WHY? BECAUSE THAT GUY'S
A COP, AND THAT GUY

01:44:09.176 --> 01:44:11.613
HAS BEEN INSIDE YOU.

01:44:11.646 --> 01:44:13.047
GET OUT
OF MY WAY.

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.148
NO.

01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:15.650
MARIA...

01:44:17.585 --> 01:44:19.821
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO STOP ME.

01:44:22.957 --> 01:44:24.392
MARIA, GET OUT
OF MY WAY.

01:44:24.426 --> 01:44:26.461
GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS
OFF ME.

01:44:26.494 --> 01:44:28.796
MARIA, GET OUT.
NO!

01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:30.031
NO!
NO, RICHARD!

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.675
DON'T YOU EVER HIT ME.

01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:42.377
YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.849
B.C.:
COME ON, MAN!
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

01:44:51.786 --> 01:44:54.255
JESUS CHRIST.
THAT GUY'S A COP!

01:44:54.288 --> 01:44:55.857
I KNOW HE'S A COP.

01:44:55.890 --> 01:44:58.259
HIS HANDS
ARE CUFFED.

01:44:58.292 --> 01:44:58.960
NOT HIM.

01:44:58.993 --> 01:44:59.794
THE OTHER ONE.

01:45:24.218 --> 01:45:25.219
( Maria screams )

01:45:29.757 --> 01:45:31.726
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?!

01:45:31.759 --> 01:45:32.860
HEY!

01:45:32.894 --> 01:45:35.229
WAIT FOR ME,
YOU BASTARD!

01:45:55.016 --> 01:45:56.484
NO!

01:45:56.518 --> 01:45:58.252
GET UP THERE.

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:15.870
( gunshot )

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:20.041
YOU WANT TO SHOOT?

01:46:20.074 --> 01:46:21.943
HUH?

01:46:21.976 --> 01:46:24.546
GO AHEAD, PAL.
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU CHICKEN?

01:46:52.239 --> 01:46:53.240
( thump )

01:47:28.309 --> 01:47:29.711
( gasping )

01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:16.584
( screams )

01:51:13.567 --> 01:51:14.702
( laughs )

01:51:16.037 --> 01:51:18.840
I HOPE YOU BELIEVE
IN REINCARNATION--

01:51:18.873 --> 01:51:20.007
SUCKER!

01:51:28.115 --> 01:51:29.083
GET AWAY!

01:52:20.968 --> 01:52:23.938
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU
A CALL, WASN'T I?

01:52:23.971 --> 01:52:25.572
I FORGOT.

01:52:27.274 --> 01:52:28.242
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

01:52:28.275 --> 01:52:30.444
NOT IF YOU DON'T
KEEP OUT OF THE WAY.

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:33.114
HEY, MAN.
HOW YOU DOING?

01:52:33.147 --> 01:52:35.449
YEAH, I'M OKAY.
I'M JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

01:52:35.482 --> 01:52:38.886
TIRED, HUH?
LISTEN. GO HOME,
GET PLENTY OF REST

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:40.054
BECAUSE WHEN
I GET BETTER

01:52:40.087 --> 01:52:42.723
I'M GOING TO BREAK
BOTH YOUR LEGS.

01:52:42.756 --> 01:52:45.059
YOU'RE DUST, LECCE.
YOU HEAR ME?

01:52:45.092 --> 01:52:48.062
NOT ONLY DID
YOU HIT ME ONCE,
BUT TWICE.

01:52:48.095 --> 01:52:50.231
THIS IS ONE OF
THE WORST NIGHTS
OF MY LIFE.

01:52:50.264 --> 01:52:52.233
WELL, I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

01:52:52.266 --> 01:52:53.567
SHE'S OKAY.
OKAY.

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.469
LUSK THINKS YOU GOT
SOMETHING GOING ON
WITH THAT GIRL.

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:57.504
HE WANTS
AN INVESTIGATION.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:52:57.538 --> 01:52:59.740
HE SAYS
YOU COULD BE
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:02.543
HELL,
I TOLD HIM YOU'RE
ALWAYS IN TROUBLE.

01:53:17.992 --> 01:53:20.094
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

01:53:20.127 --> 01:53:23.931
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS, DON'T YOU?

01:53:23.965 --> 01:53:25.799
NO.

01:53:25.833 --> 01:53:26.633
WHAT?

01:53:26.667 --> 01:53:30.337
YOU BELONG
TO ME NOW.

01:53:55.096 --> 01:53:56.830
WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
REALLY?

01:53:56.864 --> 01:53:58.132
IT'S CHRIS.
CHRIS?

01:53:58.165 --> 01:54:00.201
I LOVE
YOU, CHRIS.

01:54:02.003 --> 01:54:04.338
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

01:54:07.608 --> 01:54:09.343

WHAT A BONER.

01:54:15.883 --> 01:54:20.354
* IS IT LOVE,

* THE BROKEN RECORD

01:54:34.301 --> 01:54:36.370
* GOES ROUND AND ROUND

01:54:36.403 --> 01:54:38.372
* WITHIN A CIRCLE

01:54:38.405 --> 01:54:40.441
* WITHOUT A SOUND

01:54:40.474 --> 01:54:42.543
* I'M UNDER WATER

01:54:42.576 --> 01:54:44.611
* IN OVERDRIVE

01:54:44.645 --> 01:54:46.680
* YOU HIDE IN LAUGHTER

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:48.315
* WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
