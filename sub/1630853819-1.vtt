02:02.039 --> 02:04.125
<i>To Mr. Tatsuo Sato</i>

02:04.708 --> 02:06.877
<i>From Kayo Suzuki</i>

02:21.350 --> 02:27.898
<i>Dear brother, you don't think about the grave
because you are on your own.</i>

02:29.525 --> 02:33.195
<i>If you had your own child,</i>

02:33.445 --> 02:38.409
<i>You would know how much
our parents cared for us.</i>

02:40.202 --> 02:44.206
<i>I don't know your plan.</i>

02:44.874 --> 02:49.128
<i>But think of me,
I'm still safe keeping the ashes...</i>

02:52.423 --> 02:58.512
<i>New graveyard has been built on the hill.</i>

02:59.054 --> 03:02.933
<i>I want to buy a plot there.</i>

03:04.977 --> 03:08.397
<i>It has a lovely view.</i>

03:09.899 --> 03:13.777
<i>Can you go and have a look one day?</i>

03:21.452 --> 03:25.247
Hey.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.461
Hey.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.422
Got a light?

03:44.391 --> 03:45.267
Thanks.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.731
- Here.
- Keep it.

03:51.357 --> 03:52.858
- Keep it.
- What?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.242
Lighter.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.208
Day laborer sucks.

04:09.708 --> 04:13.921
Lazy buggers get better pay.

04:14.338 --> 04:17.091
Who did this?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.559
Only a short walk.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.812
You don't need to.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.065
Come and have something to eat.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.150
Want a ride?

04:36.652 --> 04:37.945
No thanks.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.827
What do you do?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.204
Nothing really.

04:47.830 --> 04:51.625
How do you survive?
Not in a dodgy job I hope.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.044
My company supplied these trees.

04:59.717 --> 05:02.344
Bureaucrats had them planted here.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.140
They will die in sea breeze. Ignorant.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.101
They are always discussing something.

05:09.226 --> 05:13.731
They say kindness is more important
than money.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.442
It's inferiority complex.

05:17.276 --> 05:20.321
I want money more than kindness.

05:22.072 --> 05:27.411
I used to sneak into the pool at night
for a late night swim.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.705
Me too.

05:29.830 --> 05:34.209
Really? Let's do it soon.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.045
Not at my age.

05:37.338 --> 05:42.801
The police were going to call my parents.

05:42.926 --> 05:48.223
Then a couple came out fighting.

05:48.390 --> 05:52.102
They were grabbing each other and yelling.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.438
Threatening to kill each other.

05:54.563 --> 05:58.442
So the police went to intervene.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.569
I was going to help, too.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.073
But the police said I can go.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.909
So I was spared. Great, isn't it?

06:07.618 --> 06:08.619
Here we are.

06:13.415 --> 06:17.086
Sis, anything to eat?

06:24.176 --> 06:26.428
Come in.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.155
Sis.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.242
- Come in.
- Thanks.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.127
Sit down.

06:59.628 --> 07:00.337
Sis.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.339
Quiet.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.425
It's your problem if he wakes up.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.968
Sorry to intrude.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.594
A friend from inside?

07:07.719 --> 07:08.804
Stop it.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.098
You don't have a record?

07:12.057 --> 07:12.975
No.

07:13.142 --> 07:15.936
Your friends are no good.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.824
Shut up.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.620
I can make fried rice?

07:36.290 --> 07:38.667
Give him something to eat.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.171
What's your name?

07:43.255 --> 07:44.673
I'm Sato.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.593
I'm Chinatsu.

08:00.397 --> 08:06.445
Kazuko.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.824
You're getting a lot of action for your age.

08:10.908 --> 08:11.950
Takuji.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.191
Hot, isn't it?

08:45.943 --> 08:47.402
Thanks.

08:51.657 --> 08:52.866
Use it.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.676
Ready.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.554
- Made too much.
- Thanks.

09:20.811 --> 09:24.106
What? Go ahead.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.781
It's good.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.456
Good?

09:41.832 --> 09:42.666
Yeah.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.295
It's good.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.301
What do you do?

09:54.136 --> 09:56.179
Nothing really.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.559
Married?

10:00.809 --> 10:01.977
No.

10:02.894 --> 10:03.979
I see.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.776
What?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.344
Sex maniac.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.179
Eat.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.024
What?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.323
I want to swim.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.555
He had a stroke.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.601
You knew what was going on next door.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.772
Takuji says we should kill dad.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.277
We could use drugs to control his sex urge.

12:16.111 --> 12:20.115
But it will ruin his brain.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.787
Surprised?

12:27.622 --> 12:28.623
Not really.

12:51.229 --> 12:55.233
<i>Higashiyama Cemetery</i>

13:45.116 --> 13:46.952
What do you do everyday?

13:48.370 --> 13:49.996
Pachinko and walking.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.166
Nice.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.089
Bored?

14:00.590 --> 14:01.967
Not really.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.596
You?

14:09.808 --> 14:12.143
Things are restarting in the mountains.

14:17.148 --> 14:22.279
Everyone wants to see you there.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.743
- It wasn't your fault.
- Stop it.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.062
Welcome.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.534
Beer.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.120
Here you are.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.840
You've had a few already.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.319
Something to eat?

16:36.913 --> 16:37.914
Coming.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.584
Thank you.

16:43.086 --> 16:46.923
A girl is free. Would you like her?

17:14.075 --> 17:15.702
You come to a place like this.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.163
Not really.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.170
What do you want?

17:30.425 --> 17:31.426
How much?

17:34.429 --> 17:36.389
8,000 yen.

18:57.512 --> 18:59.597
You're behaving like a woman.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.063
I am a woman.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.725
What do you want to eat?

19:46.186 --> 19:50.064
I'm sorry, can you take me home?

19:50.899 --> 19:52.317
Why?

19:56.112 --> 19:57.322
I'm tired.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.266
Pay attention.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.519
Mind the branch.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.610
Lower it.

20:39.822 --> 20:43.368
Come to see me when you're done.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.619
Yes.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.038
Takuji, it's slacking.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.847
This is from us, chairman.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.850
Thank you very much. This is a lot.

21:07.976 --> 21:11.938
Not at all.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.482
- I'm going home.
- Well done.

21:15.483 --> 21:16.317
I've finished.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.611
Come in.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.198
Is the festival lantern up?

21:22.532 --> 21:24.325
Not yet.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.536
I asked you to.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.663
Nice to see you.

21:29.664 --> 21:32.667
Here is a blank receipt.

21:33.084 --> 21:36.004
Thank you for everything.

21:44.804 --> 21:49.058
Only a town association, but has to be done.

21:51.686 --> 21:54.063
Help us again with shipping soon.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.356
Thank you.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.530
Do you know something?

22:03.072 --> 22:03.906
What?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.117
About Chinatsu.

22:09.037 --> 22:11.998
Hurry up, mum's waiting.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.333
Coming.

22:24.886 --> 22:27.847
Squish up for mum.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.766
Get in, Mami.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.101
Lock up for me.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.686
Mind the door.

22:39.734 --> 22:40.735
See you.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.258
Shall I?

23:04.675 --> 23:06.260
I'm on it.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.724
This is the last pill.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.370
I am going to go to a hospital tomorrow.

23:35.665 --> 23:40.670
Let's order sushi, Nakajima paid me.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.465
Miroku Sushi, OK?

23:44.632 --> 23:46.676
They're not as good as before.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.803
Never mind, give them a call.

23:55.977 --> 23:56.978
Tasty.

24:11.159 --> 24:15.538
Are you having a problem with Nakajima?

24:17.081 --> 24:21.002
Be nice, or it's awkward for me.

24:21.252 --> 24:25.506
Why should I, for your sake?

24:26.257 --> 24:29.844
Of course you do. Be nice.

24:30.845 --> 24:34.765
Sushi for two, please.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.767
Make it for three.

24:36.893 --> 24:38.686
For three, please.

24:42.607 --> 24:45.693
Sushi is coming.

27:41.494 --> 27:46.874
Detonate in 5 seconds. 4, 3, 2, 1, detonate.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.876
Going for a swim?

28:33.421 --> 28:34.755
Let's go.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.966
I'm not going.

28:40.511 --> 28:41.762
What are you doing?

28:44.890 --> 28:48.519
I've got these from the mountain
to sell them at the festival.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.438
Stingy.

28:50.604 --> 28:51.772
Shut up.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.616
You can have one.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.287
It's called Campanula.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.083
Look.

29:13.669 --> 29:17.923
It's annoying, hydrangea in summer.

29:18.966 --> 29:24.054
Cosmos is already out by the racetrack.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.315
Sis is still in bed.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.152
I'll get her.

29:40.821 --> 29:43.657
Sis, Tatsuo is here.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.936
Why are you here?

30:13.562 --> 30:14.730
Let's go swimming.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.650
You are on your own.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.907
Last time, I was drunk.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.700
- So?
- I came to apologize.

30:27.368 --> 30:30.287
Why? You can laugh at me.

30:30.704 --> 30:33.374
For selling myself at a place like that.

30:41.924 --> 30:43.092
I'll go.

30:49.223 --> 30:50.015
Wait.

30:53.435 --> 30:54.728
I'm coming.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.987
You aren't his wife or lover.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.423
What did you do?

31:25.092 --> 31:27.094
I used to quarry stones in the mountains.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.220
Stones?

31:29.263 --> 31:31.181
For roads and so on.

31:32.141 --> 31:33.225
I see.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.066
Was Takuji in prison?

31:43.444 --> 31:47.114
He stabbed someone in a drunken fight.

31:48.699 --> 31:51.577
It was one of the day laborers.

31:52.244 --> 31:56.248
He doesn't even remember why he did it.

31:59.126 --> 32:01.962
He used to cry a lot when he was little.

32:02.713 --> 32:05.382
Then he started to pretend he's OK.

32:09.511 --> 32:14.975
He is on parole.
He needed a job for his release.

32:15.225 --> 32:20.147
So he works at my friend's nursery garden.

32:21.565 --> 32:26.487
It's funny how he looks up to that guy.

32:26.904 --> 32:29.114
Copying the way he talks.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.954
Is he your lover?

32:38.415 --> 32:40.167
It's a rotten relationship

32:45.673 --> 32:49.009
Why did you quit the quarry?

32:54.473 --> 32:58.560
The sea is nicer than the mountains.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.189
What's that?

36:02.327 --> 36:04.580
A lunatic passes by often.

36:05.706 --> 36:06.874
I see.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.854
There is one right here.

36:32.983 --> 36:37.237
You're mad.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.650
Haven't you had enough?

38:17.546 --> 38:19.131
Who was that?

38:21.800 --> 38:22.884
Who?

38:29.349 --> 38:30.851
Are you going to hit me again?

39:02.841 --> 39:04.384
Hang on.

39:06.303 --> 39:08.472
Stop it.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.686
I don't mind if you're with someone.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.341
Let's end this.

39:47.344 --> 39:51.848
I won't take calls from you.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.486
Tatsuo.

40:51.825 --> 40:53.160
Are you off work?

40:54.995 --> 40:56.329
The nursery garden.

40:56.413 --> 40:59.708
It's only for a few days a month.

41:06.548 --> 41:08.508
Your sister's lover's company?

41:09.009 --> 41:11.470
Yeah, and he's married.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.809
Sis stayed at yours?

41:19.019 --> 41:19.728
Yes.

41:19.853 --> 41:21.438
Is that your type?

41:24.399 --> 41:26.193
She's complicated.

41:31.281 --> 41:32.282
I guess so.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.993
- Not a fling then?
- Is that bad?

41:35.118 --> 41:38.038
Of course, it's the worst.

41:38.872 --> 41:42.375
Will it ruin your parole?

41:42.709 --> 41:45.921
She's got a big mouth.

41:48.965 --> 41:51.426
I shouldn't have accepted your lighter.

41:59.309 --> 42:04.314
Go home, dad is on his own.

42:14.574 --> 42:15.992
Shall we go and eat something?

42:16.910 --> 42:20.163
- I'm penniless.
- Are you spent up?

42:20.288 --> 42:21.540
So what.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.592
You should answer your mobile.

42:33.385 --> 42:34.970
I don't carry it around.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.473
I was waiting at yours.

42:38.932 --> 42:40.684
I have nothing to say.

42:45.272 --> 42:47.399
We could go and have a drink.

42:51.903 --> 42:55.448
Takuji, he's taking us out.

42:56.491 --> 42:58.451
Really?

42:58.535 --> 42:59.786
Let's go.

43:43.872 --> 43:47.208
Let's talk about it next time.

43:52.172 --> 43:56.176
I almost forgot.
Surprise inspection will be on the 29th.

43:56.301 --> 43:57.802
Thank you.

43:57.927 --> 44:00.889
Let me know if I can help you.

44:14.944 --> 44:16.780
Come to the shop if you want to talk.

44:16.905 --> 44:17.906
I'll give you a lift home.

44:18.031 --> 44:20.116
You just can't stand being dumped.

44:21.117 --> 44:23.203
What do you want me to do?

44:52.232 --> 44:53.191
Detonate?

44:53.858 --> 44:54.859
Dynamite.

44:54.984 --> 44:57.946
The thing that explodes.

44:58.780 --> 45:01.783
I got hit by debris.
I was not concentrating.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.749
You look scary.

45:11.167 --> 45:14.254
Still, I can't give it up.

45:15.839 --> 45:17.465
I'm impressed.

45:18.299 --> 45:21.594
Do you want to be a one-eyed, too?

45:21.970 --> 45:24.681
Don't be rude.

45:25.849 --> 45:29.686
Not just an eye,
You won't be able to have sex.

45:29.978 --> 45:31.771
Can you not get it up?

45:31.938 --> 45:32.939
Fool.

45:35.483 --> 45:37.986
I'm not sure what you mean.

45:40.447 --> 45:44.367
I'm going soon. Come with me.

45:46.286 --> 45:50.790
You've rested. Everyone is waiting for you.

45:52.542 --> 45:56.463
Mountains are good. I want to go, too.

46:06.139 --> 46:13.146
Kazuko.

46:17.150 --> 46:21.821
Mother.

47:02.821 --> 47:05.698
I do triathlon.

47:06.032 --> 47:10.703
Really, you've got energy.
That's why you eat so much.

47:13.039 --> 47:14.541
Funny chap.

47:14.791 --> 47:15.834
Yes.

47:19.420 --> 47:21.756
We used to take meat to the mountain.

47:21.881 --> 47:25.802
Grilled on an iron plate.

47:29.806 --> 47:31.975
You still dream about the mountains.

47:34.602 --> 47:36.896
I dreamed every night after the accident.

47:38.731 --> 47:42.068
I kept hearing the evacuation siren.

47:45.738 --> 47:50.535
You're itching to go back, aren't you?

47:58.543 --> 48:00.795
This guy says...

48:13.224 --> 48:14.642
Do you hear voices?

48:31.618 --> 48:33.912
You won't survive in town.

48:35.914 --> 48:38.249
Ah...

48:38.625 --> 48:43.796
- Go after him.
- Sure, Tatsuo.

48:45.715 --> 48:50.386
Tatsuo, wait a minute.

48:51.888 --> 48:53.765
What's up?

48:54.474 --> 48:57.685
Say something.

48:57.810 --> 49:01.773
Tatsuo, Tatsuo.

49:42.981 --> 49:45.066
You're up early.

49:49.946 --> 49:51.698
I need to get ready for the festival.

49:51.864 --> 49:55.493
You're too noisy.

50:13.094 --> 50:14.721
I'm serious.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.891
About the mountains.

50:19.058 --> 50:21.227
Still on about it.

50:22.020 --> 50:24.981
I can't rely on sister's lover forever.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.527
There's lots of other work.

50:30.236 --> 50:31.863
Like what.

50:32.905 --> 50:37.577
Work at the squid factory like sis?
That's only for 3 days a week.

50:37.910 --> 50:39.370
There is no work.

50:42.415 --> 50:45.043
Matsumoto won't have an amateur.

50:45.168 --> 50:47.128
Everyone is an amateur at the beginning.

50:59.932 --> 51:01.059
Tatsuo.

51:03.478 --> 51:05.897
I don't want to be like my dad.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.949
Put a good word in for me.

51:17.116 --> 51:18.618
Stop it.

51:18.785 --> 51:20.078
- Please.
- Won't happen.

51:20.203 --> 51:21.996
Why?

51:22.955 --> 51:26.125
Matsumoto wants you back.

51:26.542 --> 51:29.462
Tell him you'll come back if he lets me in.

51:29.587 --> 51:31.255
Why?

51:32.799 --> 51:35.885
Please.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.011
You know...

51:48.648 --> 51:50.233
It's too much for you.

51:54.529 --> 51:56.447
What?

52:01.035 --> 52:05.748
I fed you and got you a girl
but you won't do a thing for me.

52:10.253 --> 52:12.213
You mean Chinatsu?

52:13.714 --> 52:16.092
You slept with my sister for free.

52:16.676 --> 52:18.177
Disgusting.

52:38.072 --> 52:39.615
Ouch, sorry, stop it.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.576
Wait a minute, Tatsuo.

52:41.701 --> 52:44.704
What is it?

52:45.246 --> 52:48.207
Wait, what on Earth?

52:50.459 --> 52:54.255
Stop messing around. Come out.

52:56.883 --> 53:01.262
Ouch. Wait a moment.

53:02.722 --> 53:03.848
What's wrong?

53:08.144 --> 53:09.937
Come out.

53:11.230 --> 53:14.317
Stop this, do you hear me?

53:19.071 --> 53:22.200
Tatsuo.

53:31.959 --> 53:35.755
It's clouding over. Hurry up.

53:36.088 --> 53:37.423
Yes.

53:41.385 --> 53:45.348
Okano, Hurry up.

53:47.892 --> 53:48.768
Yes.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.574
- Check the cables, too.
- Will do.

54:08.621 --> 54:12.708
Evacuate for detonation.

54:13.042 --> 54:14.210
<i>Roger.</i>

54:18.381 --> 54:20.049
- Going for line maintenance.
- OK.

54:34.313 --> 54:35.439
No.

55:01.048 --> 55:02.508
Okano.

55:43.549 --> 55:44.425
What's up?

55:45.384 --> 55:47.595
Why the sudden phone call?

55:48.971 --> 55:50.181
Yeah.

55:57.938 --> 56:02.151
You're drenched. What's wrong?

56:04.195 --> 56:07.865
Are you working today, too?

56:08.616 --> 56:09.450
What?

56:12.787 --> 56:14.413
Skive off.

56:17.583 --> 56:19.210
Who do you think you are?

56:20.753 --> 56:22.004
We did it once and...

56:22.129 --> 56:24.090
Call the shop.

56:24.215 --> 56:25.549
Why?

56:35.059 --> 56:37.728
Sure, I'm scared.

56:40.773 --> 56:44.693
I need to earn.

56:48.322 --> 56:51.784
- Call the shop.
- Stop it.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.288
What's wrong?

57:07.842 --> 57:09.343
Can you not end it?

57:10.136 --> 57:12.138
- What?
- Your rotten relationship.

57:12.680 --> 57:14.348
Don't you want to end it?

57:20.896 --> 57:25.234
Do you want to marry me?

57:36.328 --> 57:38.205
You are a fool.

57:44.295 --> 57:45.838
Aiming for a jackpot.

57:46.380 --> 57:48.132
Not possible.

57:49.049 --> 57:53.179
<i>Five minutes to the 4th race.</i>

57:53.345 --> 57:57.725
<i>The book will be closing...</i>

58:04.773 --> 58:06.025
I got it for you.

58:06.150 --> 58:07.818
Good.

58:10.196 --> 58:10.988
Have a drink.

58:11.113 --> 58:12.531
Thank you.

58:17.912 --> 58:19.163
Sit here.

58:23.250 --> 58:27.171
It won't be easy for the cyclist.

58:40.935 --> 58:43.145
How is Chinatsu?

58:43.437 --> 58:46.148
What happened?

58:47.233 --> 58:49.401
She has no idea.

58:51.070 --> 58:53.405
She's been defiant.

58:54.782 --> 58:59.411
I can get her onto a better job, too.

59:16.929 --> 59:18.764
When does your parole end?

59:20.391 --> 59:21.809
February next year.

59:23.060 --> 59:25.938
You like looking after trees?

59:26.105 --> 59:26.939
Yes.

59:27.565 --> 59:30.609
I will teach you everything.

59:32.778 --> 59:33.904
So stay with me.

59:35.030 --> 59:35.906
Sure.

59:46.292 --> 59:50.421
Good, go on.

1:00:25.247 --> 1:00:26.457
Welcome.

1:00:42.139 --> 1:00:43.015
Beer.

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:44.642
No need.

1:01:03.243 --> 1:01:04.203
Thank you.

1:01:04.328 --> 1:01:06.163
Tell me when you're done.

1:01:17.424 --> 1:01:18.717
Go home.

1:01:25.057 --> 1:01:28.727
I said to go home.

1:01:41.281 --> 1:01:42.658
In the mountains,

1:01:46.995 --> 1:01:48.747
I let someone die.

1:01:56.255 --> 1:01:57.381
I told him...

1:01:58.966 --> 1:02:02.970
I told him to hurry up.

1:02:12.271 --> 1:02:14.940
That's why you have someone like me.

1:02:15.107 --> 1:02:16.108
No.

1:02:16.275 --> 1:02:17.651
Yes you do.

1:02:34.126 --> 1:02:39.173
Stop working at a place like this.

1:02:41.967 --> 1:02:43.427
You know,

1:02:47.306 --> 1:02:52.895
I had a proper job once.
As a receptionist.

1:02:55.230 --> 1:03:00.235
But I only lasted a month.

1:03:04.490 --> 1:03:07.117
I don't understand it.

1:03:09.745 --> 1:03:15.000
Go to work everyday
and go for a drink after work.

1:03:18.086 --> 1:03:20.672
It was too decent for me.

1:03:28.347 --> 1:03:30.349
You wouldn't understand.

1:03:36.939 --> 1:03:38.732
Madame, we are done.

1:03:45.405 --> 1:03:46.615
Madame.

1:06:08.674 --> 1:06:09.675
Takuji.

1:06:15.931 --> 1:06:16.932
I'm sorry.

1:06:19.351 --> 1:06:21.895
I'm busy, don't get in my way.

1:06:25.857 --> 1:06:27.985
Where can I find Chinatsu's man?

1:06:35.075 --> 1:06:36.660
Are you mad?

1:06:40.414 --> 1:06:41.915
Wait a minute, Tatsuo.

1:07:18.326 --> 1:07:19.745
- It's you.
- Hello.

1:07:19.911 --> 1:07:21.413
- Takuji.
- Hello.

1:07:21.788 --> 1:07:24.082
Carry on.

1:07:25.751 --> 1:07:26.752
What's up?

1:07:27.210 --> 1:07:30.797
Well...

1:07:32.591 --> 1:07:33.759
Who's this?

1:07:38.263 --> 1:07:42.517
Will you break up with Chinatsu, please?

1:07:43.226 --> 1:07:44.227
What?

1:07:48.607 --> 1:07:51.276
Why did you bring him here?

1:07:52.611 --> 1:07:54.446
It's over, isn't it?

1:07:57.115 --> 1:07:59.117
You know what you're doing?

1:08:05.290 --> 1:08:07.209
You're making a fool of yourself.

1:08:10.462 --> 1:08:12.631
Do you know who I am?

1:08:34.653 --> 1:08:35.904
Get off.

1:08:38.532 --> 1:08:39.741
Get off me.

1:08:53.255 --> 1:08:54.506
Your family.

1:08:57.843 --> 1:08:59.719
You should take care of your family better.

1:09:04.266 --> 1:09:09.980
I do, that's why things get twisted.

1:09:22.659 --> 1:09:25.328
I lost my job because of you.

1:09:28.915 --> 1:09:30.959
Come with me to the mountains.

1:09:31.334 --> 1:09:32.169
What?

1:09:32.794 --> 1:09:34.713
I will ask Matsumoto.

1:09:35.172 --> 1:09:36.047
Seriously?

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:37.674
Yes.

1:09:37.924 --> 1:09:39.176
Really?

1:09:39.301 --> 1:09:40.886
If he says no, it won't happen.

1:09:41.052 --> 1:09:45.307
He won't. He will say yes if you ask him.

1:09:47.225 --> 1:09:51.229
I'm sorry, sorry. Tatsuo.

1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:53.648
I don't know.

1:09:53.773 --> 1:09:58.111
I'm sure it'll be OK. I'm counting on you.

1:09:58.403 --> 1:09:59.237
Sure.

1:09:59.529 --> 1:10:04.117
Hooray. Let's go for a drink.

1:10:05.452 --> 1:10:08.413
Drink, Tatsuo.

1:10:10.957 --> 1:10:12.918
Wait for me.

1:10:14.127 --> 1:10:17.839
Let's go for a drink.

1:11:07.138 --> 1:11:08.306
Here, Takuji.

1:13:40.458 --> 1:13:42.252
Drunken fight?

1:13:48.508 --> 1:13:49.592
No.

1:13:55.557 --> 1:13:57.142
Grow up.

1:15:02.832 --> 1:15:04.542
I knew you'd come back.

1:15:05.793 --> 1:15:07.212
I need money.

1:15:09.255 --> 1:15:10.882
Spent up your savings?

1:15:11.382 --> 1:15:12.467
Partly.

1:15:18.848 --> 1:15:20.099
Woman?

1:15:32.779 --> 1:15:35.949
I want to start a family.

1:15:43.456 --> 1:15:44.624
Fool.

1:15:47.502 --> 1:15:48.878
Look at me.

1:15:50.338 --> 1:15:53.675
I have no one left. That's fine.

1:16:00.390 --> 1:16:04.269
I'm not like you.

1:16:09.274 --> 1:16:10.900
Stop it.

1:16:11.526 --> 1:16:12.777
Indeed.

1:16:27.875 --> 1:16:28.793
When do we start?

1:16:28.918 --> 1:16:30.336
We'll know next month.

1:16:30.461 --> 1:16:33.214
Do I need something? Tell me.

1:16:33.339 --> 1:16:35.508
I will tell you before we go.

1:16:40.972 --> 1:16:42.849
Mountains.

1:16:43.266 --> 1:16:45.393
It's not a school trip.

1:16:45.810 --> 1:16:46.728
Shut up.

1:16:49.439 --> 1:16:50.982
Welcome.

1:16:56.112 --> 1:16:57.488
I told her to come.

1:17:02.660 --> 1:17:04.162
Want some beer?

1:17:04.454 --> 1:17:05.330
Sure.

1:17:05.788 --> 1:17:06.873
A glass, please.

1:17:15.214 --> 1:17:16.382
Thanks.

1:17:27.393 --> 1:17:33.524
Let's have a toast. Cheers.
To Tatsuo, and to my sister.

1:17:47.997 --> 1:17:51.125
Tatsuo wants to become my brother.

1:17:51.376 --> 1:17:53.503
Ouch. Say something.

1:18:00.385 --> 1:18:04.472
Did Nakajima do it to you?

1:18:09.894 --> 1:18:12.230
What are you thinking?

1:18:16.734 --> 1:18:21.030
I'm going to the mountains with Tatsuo.

1:18:21.406 --> 1:18:22.281
What?

1:18:24.117 --> 1:18:28.579
Let's go and tell the shop you quit.

1:18:31.666 --> 1:18:35.086
I will earn with Tatsuo from now on.

1:18:36.254 --> 1:18:37.088
Won't we?

1:18:50.143 --> 1:18:54.021
Cheers! Tatsuo, sis, cheers!

1:18:54.147 --> 1:18:57.400
Tatsuo and sis, cheers!

1:19:12.123 --> 1:19:13.207
What's that song?

1:19:15.585 --> 1:19:21.299
When I was little, I used to go to town
with dad to sell fish.

1:19:22.383 --> 1:19:26.679
He always sang this
when driving his truck.

1:19:28.514 --> 1:19:32.935
He bought me ice cream after work.

1:19:33.978 --> 1:19:38.191
We bought different flavors
and swapped.

1:20:13.726 --> 1:20:18.314
I tried to leave this town.

1:20:20.274 --> 1:20:26.322
I wanted a fresh start
where nobody knew me.

1:20:29.742 --> 1:20:33.621
But I couldn't leave my family.

1:20:40.044 --> 1:20:41.754
Before we move to the mountains,

1:20:44.173 --> 1:20:46.509
Let's visit the grave of the deceased.

1:21:10.616 --> 1:21:11.659
Yes.

1:21:17.707 --> 1:21:18.791
Thank you.

1:25:47.101 --> 1:25:51.939
I'm going to see Matsumoto with Takuji.
Paperwork to sort out.

1:25:52.731 --> 1:25:55.151
Call me when it's done.

1:25:55.484 --> 1:25:56.193
Sure.

1:25:56.318 --> 1:25:57.319
See you.

1:26:43.407 --> 1:26:46.368
Your boyfriend came to see me.

1:26:48.078 --> 1:26:49.538
Why didn't you come yourself?

1:26:52.291 --> 1:26:56.503
Who writes the report
to Takuji's probation officer?

1:26:58.839 --> 1:27:01.800
Do you want to ruin his parole?

1:27:08.015 --> 1:27:09.767
You are disgusting.

1:27:10.434 --> 1:27:12.311
Get in.

1:28:47.948 --> 1:28:49.325
What do you want?

1:28:53.078 --> 1:28:57.708
I had to do this
just to have a proper talk with you.

1:29:02.921 --> 1:29:08.218
I need you.

1:29:13.307 --> 1:29:17.436
If you want to do it so much,
go to a brothel.

1:29:18.354 --> 1:29:20.564
You'll get a more obedient girl.

1:29:20.731 --> 1:29:21.940
You.

1:29:33.202 --> 1:29:34.620
Make it quick.

1:29:45.255 --> 1:29:46.799
Recline the seat.

1:30:48.485 --> 1:30:50.237
Be quiet.

1:31:36.408 --> 1:31:37.493
Hi.

1:31:38.035 --> 1:31:41.371
I'm going to see Tatsuo.

1:31:42.331 --> 1:31:45.459
We need to talk about the mountains.

1:31:55.511 --> 1:31:56.553
What happened to your face?

1:31:56.678 --> 1:31:59.598
Nothing. I walked into something.

1:32:03.852 --> 1:32:05.020
Don't tell him.

1:32:40.138 --> 1:32:43.642
We'll get crawlers working next week.

1:32:46.311 --> 1:32:49.439
It's 18-meters high this time.

1:32:50.274 --> 1:32:51.942
Deck charge?

1:32:55.571 --> 1:32:59.366
Yes, it's also wide. We can set 20 at least.

1:35:39.818 --> 1:35:41.778
Takuji

1:35:42.904 --> 1:35:45.323
Join us.

1:35:49.661 --> 1:35:52.372
Did you see my sister today?

1:35:53.290 --> 1:35:54.291
I did.

1:35:55.834 --> 1:35:58.545
Can you still smell her on my fingers?

1:36:06.511 --> 1:36:09.639
I paid, so she shouldn't complain.

1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:16.146
You know she's quit.

1:36:16.271 --> 1:36:21.818
She'll be back soon.
Filthy girl, it's in her blood.

1:36:27.365 --> 1:36:31.912
Go and get something to eat.

1:37:22.921 --> 1:37:24.130
What's that?

1:37:25.507 --> 1:37:29.177
What's in your hand? Let go.

1:37:45.610 --> 1:37:48.655
Look at yourself.

1:37:50.115 --> 1:37:51.116
Go home.

1:37:53.368 --> 1:37:55.912
No one wants you.

1:38:07.215 --> 1:38:11.344
Stop it, Takuji. Someone stop him.

1:38:17.726 --> 1:38:23.607
Stop it. Help me.

1:38:23.773 --> 1:38:25.817
Takuji, stop.

1:38:27.944 --> 1:38:29.237
Stop.

1:38:44.711 --> 1:38:46.087
Ambulance.

1:39:08.109 --> 1:39:09.152
Chinatsu.

1:39:11.237 --> 1:39:12.489
What happened?

1:39:14.366 --> 1:39:16.159
It's my fault.

1:39:17.744 --> 1:39:19.829
It's all because he has bad friends.

1:39:19.996 --> 1:39:21.998
Stop it, mother.

1:39:23.667 --> 1:39:25.919
Where is Takuji?

1:39:39.474 --> 1:39:40.642
Has he run?

1:39:45.355 --> 1:39:47.315
There is nowhere to go.

1:40:11.381 --> 1:40:12.799
Leave it with me.

1:41:06.102 --> 1:41:08.938
It's all because he has bad friends.

1:41:11.274 --> 1:41:13.693
Bad company.

1:41:19.574 --> 1:41:22.869
Tatsuo wants me to...

1:41:32.295 --> 1:41:33.755
Do it yourself.

1:41:53.399 --> 1:41:58.321
Go for a walk, mother.

1:43:20.361 --> 1:43:21.571
Tatsuo.

1:43:25.074 --> 1:43:26.075
Give me a cigarette.

1:45:11.472 --> 1:45:12.974
I have a lighter.

1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:53.306
Did he die?

1:45:54.515 --> 1:45:55.683
No.

1:45:58.102 --> 1:46:01.773
He is tough.

1:46:02.231 --> 1:46:03.566
Yeah.

1:46:12.742 --> 1:46:13.951
Shit.

1:46:16.496 --> 1:46:17.705
Tatsuo.

1:46:17.872 --> 1:46:18.790
What?

1:46:20.208 --> 1:46:24.420
I can't go to the mountains.

1:46:34.138 --> 1:46:35.807
I can't go.

1:46:39.268 --> 1:46:43.106
Mum, dad and sis.

1:46:44.607 --> 1:46:47.026
I wanted to make them happy.

1:46:48.945 --> 1:46:49.946
I...

1:46:52.949 --> 1:46:56.035
I just wanted to make everyone happy.

1:47:12.927 --> 1:47:16.556
I can't do anything right.

1:47:18.975 --> 1:47:23.104
Nothing at all.

1:47:27.275 --> 1:47:30.820
Tatsuo, thank you.

1:48:30.046 --> 1:48:31.047
Thanks.

1:49:14.423 --> 1:49:20.763
<i>Dear brother, I'm so happy to hear from you
after such a long time.</i>

1:49:23.349 --> 1:49:26.936

1:49:33.943 --> 1:49:38.573
<i>I envied my friend who had sisters
when I was little.</i>

1:49:38.990 --> 1:49:43.452
<i>I wanted to be a daughter of her family.</i>

1:49:44.954 --> 1:49:47.957
<i>My dream will finally come true.</i>

1:49:59.635 --> 1:50:04.932
<i>My husband's family became my family.</i>

1:50:05.433 --> 1:50:10.438
<i>We will have more family when you marry.</i>

1:50:10.563 --> 1:50:13.107
<i>I like that very much.</i>

1:50:15.151 --> 1:50:21.741
<i>I need to come back soon for some chores.
I would love to see her then.</i>

1:50:23.326 --> 1:50:26.704
<i>I 'm looking forward to it.</i>

1:52:03.092 --> 1:52:06.053
Chinatsu.

1:52:35.291 --> 1:52:39.295
Chinatsu.
