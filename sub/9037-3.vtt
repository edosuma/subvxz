00:02.769 --> 00:05.604
- You know what today is,
don't you?

00:05.606 --> 00:08.207
It's the second anniversary
of your brother's divorce.

00:08.209 --> 00:11.110
- Oh, I didn't
get him a card.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.179
- You should see him

00:14.181 --> 00:15.514
Sitting over there
with the dog.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.083
It is so sad.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.685
Oh, your father's
trying everything

00:19.687 --> 00:21.620
To get him
to snap out of it.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.654
- What's he doing?

00:22.656 --> 00:25.591
- He's yelling,
"snap out of it."

00:25.593 --> 00:27.426
- Why is robert
thinking about his divorce?

00:27.428 --> 00:29.495
He's got this
great girlfriend now.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.562
Where is amy?

00:30.564 --> 00:32.464
- She's out of town
on business.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.533
Does she care
that robert is sensitive?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.168
- Ma.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.503
- Does she care about
this is the day that--

00:37.505 --> 00:40.172
- Ma, ma, ma!

00:40.174 --> 00:43.175
What do you want?

00:43.177 --> 00:45.711
- I want you to be
a brother.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.579
Go to him.

00:47.581 --> 00:52.084
- What?

00:52.086 --> 00:54.420
- Take him out.
Spend an evening with him.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.221
Make him feel better.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.158
Your father and I
are out of material.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.393
- Is he gonna do it?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.798
- I'm not going over there,
all right?

01:05.800 --> 01:07.066
I wouldn't know
what to say.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.134
- I don't care
what you say.

01:09.136 --> 01:11.537
Just get him
out of the house.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.572
It's depressing.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.311
- I really don't believe
you people.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.680
He's your son.
He's your brother.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.382
None of you
can talk to him?

01:23.384 --> 01:26.652
- Where have you been?

01:26.654 --> 01:28.454
- Look, robert's going
through a tough time.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.255
All he needs is someone
to listen to him,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.157
To understand
what he's going through.

01:34.828 --> 01:38.597
- You go.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.265
- No, not me.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.633
I mean, if I went,

01:41.635 --> 01:43.569
It would only be embarrassing
for robert.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.104
He would know that you're all
over here talking about him.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.705
- She's right.
Not her.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.474
She's not family.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.278
- That's how
I'm able to go on.

01:55.381 --> 01:56.482
- What's to eat here?

01:56.484 --> 01:57.483
- Probably nothing.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.151
I'll make you something.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.554
- Ray, you got
to go over there.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.722
- I don't want
to talk to him.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.324
- Don't talk to him, then.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.192
Just...Well,
take him to the movies.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.328
You don't have
to talk at the movies.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.730
- That's true.
You don't have to talk.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.266
We should go
to movies more.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.367
- Ray.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.368
- I don't want to go.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.469
- I don't want your--

02:17.471 --> 02:18.704
- All right. Shh!

02:18.706 --> 02:20.806
- Listen.
[mumbling]

02:29.415 --> 02:30.516
- All right, look,
I'll go.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.817
But later...

02:31.819 --> 02:34.820
[mumbling]

02:44.364 --> 02:45.564
Hey.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.199
- Hey.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.337
- So...

02:55.775 --> 02:57.876
How's it going?

02:57.878 --> 02:59.878
- Well...

02:59.880 --> 03:02.514
You know,
today's...

03:02.516 --> 03:04.383
- Oh, yeah.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.685
- Yep!

03:06.687 --> 03:08.187
That's today.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.969
- Where's the dog?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.637
- Went out.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.379
- That's what they do.
They go out.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.417
- Yeah, they do, yeah.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.454
- I was gonna go out too.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.425
- Where you going?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.694
- Nowhere.
I don't know.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.731
Movies, something,
you know.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.334
- Movie, huh?

03:55.336 --> 03:56.602
- Yeah. Why?
Did you want to...

03:56.604 --> 03:58.337
- No, no.
No.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.541
- You sure?
'cause...

04:02.543 --> 04:03.942
I was thinking, uh...

04:03.944 --> 04:06.278
- What?

04:06.280 --> 04:08.247
Want me to go?

04:08.249 --> 04:10.449
- If you don't sit
in front of me.

04:14.554 --> 04:15.887
- Where's debra?

04:15.889 --> 04:19.458
- Tired. She's...
Kids, you know?

04:19.460 --> 04:21.260
Yeah.
- Just you and me?

04:21.262 --> 04:21.960
- Unless you don't want to.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.430
- No, no.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.633
- Good, good.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.034
- What's playing?

04:29.036 --> 04:31.403
- Whatever. The 8:30.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.339
- Good, good, good.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.308
Huh, maybe I'll go with you.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.582
- Although the shooting...
- Yeah.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.916
- I'll tell you,
my favorite part

04:44.918 --> 04:45.917
Was when the guy
hits the pimp

04:45.919 --> 04:47.452
With the manhole cover.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.689
- No, I saw that coming.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.458
Yeah, you know the part
that I thought was fake?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.893
When that little guy
came in the room

04:54.895 --> 04:56.728
Shooting like this:
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

04:56.730 --> 04:58.797
What was that?
- I loved that.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.434
- You're sacrificing accuracy.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.636
- Anybody can shoot like this:
Boom. Boom. Boom.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.904
That's boring.
That's boring.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.506
You've seen that
in a hundred movies.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.841
But this way...

05:09.843 --> 05:13.979
Let's say this table here
is full of drugs, right?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.614
Bad guys on each side,

05:15.616 --> 05:16.848
And they're splitting up
the money.

05:16.850 --> 05:17.816
You know, you come in:
Boom!

05:17.818 --> 05:19.818
"hey, mother..."

05:31.931 --> 05:34.466
Get down!

05:43.109 --> 05:44.476
I know.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.476
It's kind of messy,

05:45.478 --> 05:47.379
But there was some shooting
in the movie

05:47.381 --> 05:50.482
That we had to try, and...

05:50.484 --> 05:51.516
I know.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.617
It's late,
and we were loud,

05:52.619 --> 05:55.087
And the kids
are sleeping, and...

05:55.089 --> 05:57.089
Oh, look.
You were sleeping too.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.461
- Nonpareil?

06:23.950 --> 06:25.951
Man.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.487
She really
let you have it, huh?

06:30.123 --> 06:32.557
- She had that look like mom did
when we were kids

06:32.559 --> 06:34.559
And she caught us eating
that whole box of sucrets.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.762
Remember that?

06:36.764 --> 06:38.964
- Yeah, my tongue
was numb for a month.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.001
- Mom thought we were gonna be
drug addicts.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.636
She said,
"that's how it starts!"

06:46.539 --> 06:47.706
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.875
- Huh?
Yeah.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.777
Remember when she flushed

06:51.779 --> 06:53.011
The children's aspirin
down the toilet?

06:53.013 --> 06:54.446
- Yeah.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.747
Those sucrets
were your idea.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.616
- Yeah.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.117
But you were
right there with me,

06:59.119 --> 07:01.086
Lozenge for lozenge.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.821
Everything I did,
you always did.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.590
- Yeah.
- Couldn't get rid of you.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.792
Remember what I used
to call you?

07:06.794 --> 07:09.094
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.162
- What did I used
to call you?

07:10.164 --> 07:13.098
- Right-behind-me raymond.
- Yeah.

07:21.674 --> 07:22.908
- All right, go ahead.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.476
- Yeah.

07:25.545 --> 07:28.547
[spoons clinking loudly]

07:35.555 --> 07:37.055
Do you remember
that assistant principal?

07:37.057 --> 07:38.523
Mrs. Mccaffrey.

07:38.525 --> 07:39.825
Right? The one
with the wooden leg?

07:39.827 --> 07:41.660
- Yeah, yeah.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.961
I used to try to sneak
a look at her legs

07:42.963 --> 07:44.663
To figure out
which one it was.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.599
- It was her left one.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.968
- Yeah?
How could you tell?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.838
- No hair on it.
- Ah.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.838
[laughs]

07:53.840 --> 07:56.141
Hey, remember...
Remember mike kimmelman?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.976
He snuck
into her office.

07:57.978 --> 08:02.247
He left her an apple
and a can of lemon pledge.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.982
- Crazy kimmelman, huh?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.517
- Ah, kimmelman.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.228
- Well, getting kind of late.
- Yeah.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.230
- Got a day shift tomorrow.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.271
Listen.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.507
This was, uh...

08:28.509 --> 08:30.876
You know, 'cause...

08:30.878 --> 08:33.778
I was feeling a little...
Then you...

08:33.780 --> 08:35.247
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.249
Listen,
I'll see you.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.017
- Yeah.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.125
Hey.
- Yeah.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.227
- Tonight was good.
It was good.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.097
- It was good.
- Yeah.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.299
- Thanks for asking me.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.735
- I'm glad mom and dad
thought of it, really.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.272
- What?

09:02.542 --> 09:03.742
- Huh?

09:07.647 --> 09:09.080
- You mean
this was their idea?

09:10.750 --> 09:12.851
- Yeah,
but it was a good one.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.186
- Whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.955
You asked me to go
with you tonight

09:16.957 --> 09:18.990
Because they told you to?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.892
- Oh, no, no, no.
Not told.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.761
They told me
you were alone, that's all.

09:22.763 --> 09:26.197
- Thanks a lot, raymond.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.632
Thanks for the charity.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.134
- Oh, come on.
Robert. Robert!

09:29.136 --> 09:30.669
Come on!

09:30.671 --> 09:32.704
Robert.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.292
Hey.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.262
Can I talk to you?

09:58.831 --> 10:00.298
Robert, stop a second.

10:03.636 --> 10:05.704
- 68.

10:10.843 --> 10:13.178
- Mom and dad didn't tell me
to go with you.

10:13.180 --> 10:17.315
Okay, they told me,
but then I agreed to it.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.750
Okay?

10:20.820 --> 10:23.221
Come on. Come on, robert.
I'm serious.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.624
Look, we can go to another movie
if you want.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.092
And nobody's telling me
to say that.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.327
That's just me talkin'.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.663
- I just want some tea.
My throat hurts.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.665
- As long as you're down here,
make me something.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.133
- Frank,
the boys are back.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.636
- Hey...

10:37.638 --> 10:39.704
Wasn't it nice of ray
to come and get you

10:39.706 --> 10:41.640
And take you somewhere?

10:47.913 --> 10:49.914
- I know what you did.
You put ray up to it.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.050
Thanks a lot.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.286
- Well, you're just sittin'
around here like a lump.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.657
Jeez, you try to be
sensitive to somebody...

10:58.659 --> 11:01.159
- Ugh.
Again with the shoes?

11:01.161 --> 11:04.396
Ooh, I have a sore throat.

11:04.398 --> 11:07.832
- Maybe you should
take a sucrets, mom.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.702
- Oh, that's a good idea.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.270
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:21.781 --> 11:25.183
- Yeah. Don't take too many
of those, though, ma, you know?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.718
[laughs]

11:26.720 --> 11:29.020
- What's...

11:29.022 --> 11:32.057
What's so funny?
I have a sore throat.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.458
[laughter]

11:33.460 --> 11:36.361
- That is a little funny.
[laughs]

11:36.363 --> 11:38.863
- Why is that funny, frank?

11:38.865 --> 11:41.399
- Because you're always talking,
so you got a sore throat.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.934
[laughter]

11:42.936 --> 11:45.070
- So my pain
is your pleasure?

11:45.072 --> 11:47.305
- That's not pain.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.808
I was in korea.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.376
<i>That</i> was pain.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.712
- Oh, yeah. That's right.
Korea, dad, huh?

11:53.714 --> 11:54.712
Yeah, but at least they had

11:54.714 --> 11:57.215
A lot of medicine
over there, right?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.384
- They did not!

11:59.386 --> 12:01.786
It was just the opposite.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.822
You take a mortar shell
right in the head,

12:03.824 --> 12:07.292
They slap a band-aid on it
and say, "snap out of it!

12:07.294 --> 12:09.227
- Walk it off!"

12:09.229 --> 12:11.129
- That's right.
- Tough it out.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.164
- If you love somethin',
set it free.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.501
- What?

12:16.503 --> 12:17.736
- What,
they didn't say that?

12:17.738 --> 12:18.937
They didn't say that
over there?

12:18.939 --> 12:23.742
[laughter]

12:23.744 --> 12:26.244
- What--what are you?
Are you wise guys?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.279
- No, no.
- No, no.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.748
- Hey, what is this?

12:29.750 --> 12:31.483
Has someone been eating
my sucrets?

12:33.252 --> 12:35.120
- Yes!

12:35.122 --> 12:37.388
Yes, we're hopped up
on the sucrets.

12:38.991 --> 12:41.226
- Look at all
the pretty colors.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.130
- Hey, dad's got hair!

12:46.866 --> 12:51.136
- Come on. No, no, no.
There were six in here.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.804
- Hey, ma, look.
Don't worry. I know a guy.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.206
We can score
some more for you.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.144
- What's so damn funny?

12:59.146 --> 13:03.081
- Nothin'. Nothin' funny.
Nothing's funny.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.150
[laughter]

13:05.152 --> 13:07.919
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
Keep laughing.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.254
One of these days,
you'll turn around,

13:09.256 --> 13:10.421
And I won't be here.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.863
- Not today.
- Ah!

13:18.865 --> 13:21.466
[laughter]

13:31.010 --> 13:32.243
- Hey, robert.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.243
How's it going?
- Great, great.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.080
Decided to come over and watch
a ballgame with raymond.

13:36.082 --> 13:40.351
- Noooo!
- He's puttin' the kids to bed.

13:40.353 --> 13:44.389
You know, I love it that you two
are gettin' along so well.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.524
Kind of reminds me
of me and my sister...

13:46.526 --> 13:48.326
When we used to get along.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.096
[loud crash]

13:52.098 --> 13:55.133
Eh...How's it going
up there?

13:55.135 --> 13:56.868
- They want you!

13:59.038 --> 14:00.538
- Listen, deb,
if it's okay with you,

14:00.540 --> 14:03.174
I was thinkin' maybe
I'd take ray fishin' on Sunday.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.943
- Oh, yeah?
Oh, great.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.311
You guys can
bring home dinner.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.914
- No, no.
Strictly catch and release.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.583
Yeah, it's not
about the fish.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.018
It's about two guys in a boat,
sittin' on the water

14:14.020 --> 14:16.321
With a big cooler
full of soda and peaches.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.060
What did I do?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.428
- You're just cute,
that's all.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.263
- Ah...

14:25.265 --> 14:27.866
- Sorry. They want to talk
to my supervisor.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.537
- You should know
I'm interviewing other people

14:32.539 --> 14:34.272
For your position.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.209
- So, raymond,
you ready for the knicks?

14:38.211 --> 14:40.278
- Got the ginger ale.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.046
- Hey, your brother wants
to take you fishing on Sunday.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.015
- Oh, yeah?
Hey, that's great.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.352
- Hey, ally,
what are you still doing up?

14:47.354 --> 14:50.188
- I had a bad dream.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.925
- Come on, kiddo.
I know all about bad dreams.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.960
At least you get
to wake up here.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.967
- Oh, my god. Fishing.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.103
- What?
What's wrong with fishing?

15:05.105 --> 15:06.504
- I'm fishing with robert.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.939
Look, I like
doing things with him,

15:07.941 --> 15:10.041
But fishing is too quiet.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.176
I like loud things.
He's gonna want to talk.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.279
- So why can't you
talk to him?

15:14.281 --> 15:16.014
You know, talk about...

15:16.016 --> 15:19.951
Cars or breasts or whatever crap
guys talk about.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.654
- I wish.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.055
Since we've been hangin' out,

15:24.057 --> 15:27.392
It seems like he wants
to talk about...

15:27.394 --> 15:28.559
- What? Talk about what?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.528
- Feelings.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.197
- Feelings?
Oh, no.

15:33.199 --> 15:37.001
That could lead to caring
and even...Closeness.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.003
[shudders]

15:42.007 --> 15:44.242
- The two of us
just stuck on a boat

15:44.244 --> 15:46.644
With the soda
and the peaches.

15:48.580 --> 15:52.317
- I'll tell you, those kids
get cuter every day, huh?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.218
Oh, man,
don't you just melt

15:54.220 --> 15:56.287
When they give you
that good-night kiss

15:56.289 --> 15:58.156
And tell you how much
they love you?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.058
- Yeah, well,
that's a great thing.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.360
Listen, the game's gonna start.
Let's crank it up.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.095
Turn it way loud

16:04.097 --> 16:05.330
So it's like we're there.

16:09.601 --> 16:11.135
- So how was work today?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.135
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.738
I want to catch
the opening lineup here.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.474
- Mr. Speaker, the president
of the United States.

16:16.476 --> 16:22.280
<i>[hail to the chief</i> plays]

16:25.718 --> 16:29.287
- What the hell is this?

16:29.289 --> 16:31.689
- It's the damn
state of the union address.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.324
- Now?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.526
He's got to do this now?

16:35.528 --> 16:37.695
Oh, god,
it's on every channel.

16:39.698 --> 16:42.667
- Oh, man. Well, here,
let's just turn it off.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.502
Give us a chance to talk.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.008
You know what I did
to mom today?

16:50.010 --> 16:52.710
I got into
the sucrets drawer.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.445
I put more in.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.117
Can't wait to see her face.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.287
- Yeah, the sucrets.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.295
- You know what was funny
about the other night?

17:11.297 --> 17:14.532
Making fun of mom and dad,
I realized something.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.768
Only you and I know
how funny they really are.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.469
No one else has that.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.138
- Yeah.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.507
It's kind of that
unspoken thing, you know?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.542
The thing that really doesn't
have to be spoken about,

17:24.544 --> 17:25.710
You know?

17:27.513 --> 17:28.579
You want to rent a movie
or something?

17:28.581 --> 17:31.182
- No, no.
No.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.484
Listen, I wanted
to ask you something.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.620
- [stifling a groan]

17:37.723 --> 17:39.090
- It's about amy.

17:39.092 --> 17:43.227
- Oh...Okay. Amy?
Go ahead.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.630
- Did you feel that...

17:45.632 --> 17:48.066
You had to sleep with debra
to see whether or not

17:48.068 --> 17:49.367
You were really
in love with her?

17:57.176 --> 17:58.509
I--I mean, you know,

17:58.511 --> 18:00.545
I think that sexual attraction
is so important,

18:00.547 --> 18:02.246
And I was just wondering

18:02.248 --> 18:05.650
If your feelings changed
for debra after you had sex.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.860
- What happened to amy?

18:15.862 --> 18:18.629
- Well, look, this is
what I'm going through.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.498
I wanted to talk about it.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.835
We never used to be able
to talk like this.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.870
- Yeah...

18:28.140 --> 18:29.740
- What's the matter?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.510
- I just--I'm not good
at this stuff, you know?

18:32.512 --> 18:33.644
- Want to talk about it?

18:33.646 --> 18:35.813
- No!

18:35.815 --> 18:38.749
I don't like talkin'.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.385
- You mean you don't like
talkin' to me.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.753
- That's right.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.589
I don't like talkin'
about this stuff with you.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.291
It gives me the creeps.
You're my brother.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.593
- Want to talk about that?

18:48.595 --> 18:51.229
- No! No! No.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.331
I just want it
to be like before.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.532
- Where you didn't
talk to me at all.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.334
- No--

18:56.336 --> 18:57.635
- Oh, come on.
Admit it, raymond!

18:57.637 --> 18:59.437
You never wanted
to be close.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.772
- Close? You grew up
in the same room as me.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.207
You live
right across the street.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.609
You're over at my house
every day.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.177
How much closer
can we be?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.245
- Well,
I don't know you, okay?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.247
I want to know you.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.182
- Okay! You want to know me?
- Yeah!

19:11.184 --> 19:12.182
- All right.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.719
You asked about the first time
I had sex with Debra.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.154
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.
I couldn't believe it.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.555
I couldn't believe
that someone like her

19:17.557 --> 19:20.224
Would allow someone like me
to sleep with them.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.626
So you know
what happened?

19:21.628 --> 19:23.161
I cried, all right?

19:23.163 --> 19:24.729
I cried.
I was so embarrassed.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.729
I couldn't let her see me,

19:25.731 --> 19:30.268
So for the whole time, I never
looked at her once, okay?

20:13.779 --> 20:17.481
- President looks good.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.584
- Yeah.

20:19.586 --> 20:23.321
- Yeah.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.388
- Chip?
- Yeah.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.825
- Speaker...

20:27.827 --> 20:30.995
Speaker,
mr. Vice president...

20:30.997 --> 20:32.263
- Game will be on soon.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.332
- Yeah.
Yeah, it'll be good.

20:36.635 --> 20:37.635
- Let's turn it up.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.871
- Yeah, turn it up.

20:40.873 --> 20:45.243
- The challenge is great
as any in our peacetime history.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.578
[both sigh heavily]
