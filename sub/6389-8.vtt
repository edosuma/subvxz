WEBVTT

00:00.402 --> 00:02.052
Previously on Californication...

00:02.149 --> 00:03.651
*** is fucking my shit up.

00:03.771 --> 00:05.809
He's all about the drama,
I'm all about the fucking fun.

00:05.929 --> 00:06.919
I'm not that funny.

00:07.039 --> 00:09.876
Yeah, but you's fucking witty,
and together we can...

00:10.253 --> 00:11.052
Damn.

00:11.590 --> 00:13.890
- Who's that piece ass?
- That? That would be Julia.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.482
Is it cool if I...pursue her?

00:16.602 --> 00:18.594
- You're not looking to rekindle?
- No, no, not at all.

00:18.714 --> 00:19.251
Why not?

00:19.371 --> 00:20.410
- This is...
- It's a terrible idea.

00:20.443 --> 00:21.461
A terrible idea.

00:21.581 --> 00:23.610
I don't like the way Rath
is writing my character.

00:23.643 --> 00:26.914
You're--you're very pleasant,
uh, just very--very real.

00:26.947 --> 00:28.482
- [Gasps]
- Oh!

00:28.515 --> 00:30.305
[Clears throat]
I can do better.

00:30.338 --> 00:32.100
I want to sleep
with Marcy again,

00:32.133 --> 00:34.590
with your permission
and hers, of course.

00:34.623 --> 00:38.996
I am willing to pay you guys
a cool $1 million

00:39.392 --> 00:41.746
if you will let me
sleep with her again.

00:41.971 --> 00:44.440
Think about it.

00:44.473 --> 00:45.879
We were wondering

00:45.912 --> 00:47.528
if maybe he could audition
for a small part.

00:47.561 --> 00:48.944
Um, yeah, you can read

00:48.977 --> 00:50.486
- for something.
- Awesome.

00:50.519 --> 00:52.121
I want to talk
to you about Becca.

00:52.154 --> 00:54.026
I know.
That's why I'm ducking you.

00:54.059 --> 00:56.851
Well, when are you gonna
tell her about Levon?

00:56.892 --> 00:59.630
Just don't give up on me, okay?

00:59.663 --> 01:01.926
I'm still me.

01:01.959 --> 01:04.165
We're still us.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.487
I got it.

02:04.606 --> 02:06.676
I fucking got it.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.907
How about I just kiss the bitch?

02:08.941 --> 02:09.908
- What?
- No.

02:09.942 --> 02:10.907
What?
Wait. What did you say?

02:10.949 --> 02:13.713
What if I just grabbed her face,

02:13.746 --> 02:15.546
went in for a slow kiss,

02:15.579 --> 02:17.714
and just made out with her,
you know what I'm saying?

02:17.747 --> 02:19.427
Okay, guys,
I'm calling my fucking agent,

02:19.452 --> 02:20.524
- 'cause this is bullshit.
- Amy, hold on.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.620
Wait.
How is this bullshit?

02:21.653 --> 02:23.092
Yo, let's be bold up
in this bitch.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.156
- Yeah, I--
- What does that even mean?

02:24.189 --> 02:25.695
I'm not really up on the rules

02:25.728 --> 02:28.969
of television, per se,
but I think the idea is to--

02:29.002 --> 02:30.938
- is to milk the sexual tension...
- It is.

02:30.971 --> 02:33.044
For as long
as inhumanly possible.

02:33.077 --> 02:34.245
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:34.278 --> 02:36.675
Let's milk
the sexual tension, right?

02:36.716 --> 02:38.644
Fuck that.
Let's change that rule.

02:38.685 --> 02:39.981
I'd have to run that by Rath.

02:40.014 --> 02:41.318
Yo, where's
that motherfucker anyways?

02:41.351 --> 02:42.622
He's not even around.
He's never even here.

02:42.655 --> 02:44.558
He just sits up
in his ivory tower,

02:44.591 --> 02:46.158
pulling strings, just like,

02:46.191 --> 02:48.664
"Dance for me, motherfucker!
Dance! Yeah! Unh!"

02:48.697 --> 02:50.330
Tell him I am not his bojangles.

02:50.365 --> 02:52.174
He's got, like,
a zillion things to do,

02:52.207 --> 02:54.380
and he--he thinks the set
is a big time-waster,

02:54.413 --> 02:56.413
and I'm beginning
to see his point.

02:56.454 --> 02:57.917
- [Sighs]
- Let's not waste time, then.

02:57.950 --> 03:01.256
What if I kiss this bitch,
make her jealous,

03:01.289 --> 03:02.826
and they just start,
like, fighting.

03:02.860 --> 03:03.963
Can you stop calling

03:03.996 --> 03:05.068
- us bitches, Hashtag?
- Yeah.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.165
Oh, I'm sorry, ladies.

03:06.198 --> 03:07.732
Look, I'm--
look, I mean no harm.

03:07.773 --> 03:09.406
It's just, like--you know,
I got love for both of y'all,

03:09.439 --> 03:10.839
but it's the way
I express myself.

03:10.872 --> 03:12.606
You got to let me be free
with my language.

03:12.639 --> 03:14.680
That's what makes me
the Bruce Lee of comedy,

03:14.713 --> 03:15.746
you know what I'm saying?

03:15.787 --> 03:17.788
"Enter the fucking dragon,"
whoo!

03:17.821 --> 03:19.219
<i>Herr</i> Director,

03:19.252 --> 03:21.460
care to weigh in
with your expert opinion?

03:21.493 --> 03:23.861
I mean, I think Hashtag has a point.

03:23.894 --> 03:26.367
Network television is
on its fucking deathbed.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.231
Goethe said it best.

03:28.264 --> 03:33.011
Let's be bold, mighty forces
will come to our aid.

03:33.044 --> 03:35.244
- What do you think?
- Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:35.277 --> 03:37.182
I don't know who
this bitch "Berta" is,

03:37.215 --> 03:38.488
but I like the way she thinks.

03:38.521 --> 03:42.994
All right, so I think
you should talk to Rath.

03:43.027 --> 03:44.291
Half hour, you guys.

03:44.331 --> 03:47.070
Half hour, everybody.

03:47.103 --> 03:48.367
You really think this
is a good idea?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.735
I think it's a terrible idea.

03:49.768 --> 03:51.641
He's a fucking crazy person.

03:51.674 --> 03:53.074
He terrifies me, Hank,

03:53.114 --> 03:54.282
but I got to keep him
on my side,

03:54.315 --> 03:55.946
or it's gonna be
a long fucking season.

03:55.979 --> 03:57.547
You're fucking useless,
you know that?

03:57.580 --> 03:58.851
Am I?
Am I useless?

03:58.884 --> 04:02.051
Or am I, like,
a strategic thinker?

04:02.092 --> 04:03.123
Useless.

04:03.156 --> 04:04.755
Just go talk to Rath.

04:04.788 --> 04:07.124
He'll shout it down.
We'll do it as scripted.

04:07.165 --> 04:10.134
Sometimes you got to indulge
the children.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.631
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:11.671 --> 04:14.031
You're not gonna make me kiss
that fucking lunatic, are you?

04:14.041 --> 04:17.012
- Not if I can help it.
- Thank God...

04:17.045 --> 04:19.317
'cause I can think of somebody
else I'd much rather be kissing.

04:19.350 --> 04:21.519
- The director?
- [Laughs]

04:21.552 --> 04:23.087
God. [Gasps]
Did I tell you?

04:23.120 --> 04:25.119
He texted me a picture
of his penis.

04:25.159 --> 04:27.127
Oh.
How'd you respond?

04:27.160 --> 04:29.294
I texted back, saying,
"Where's the rest of it?"

04:29.327 --> 04:30.430
- Ah!
- [Laughs]

04:30.463 --> 04:31.797
He hasn't give me a note since.

04:31.830 --> 04:34.563
Amy Taylor Walsh,
kicking ass and taking names.

04:34.596 --> 04:36.099
That's right, motherfucker.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.405
- Yeah, motherfucker.
- [Laughs]

04:38.439 --> 04:40.134
- Speaking of notes...
- Yeah?

04:40.175 --> 04:42.807
Do you want to come
to my trailer and discuss.

04:42.841 --> 04:45.175
Yeah, I'm--I'm trying to be
a good boy, you know?

04:45.208 --> 04:46.646
I'm trying to keep
my head on straight.

04:46.679 --> 04:48.909
[Sighs] Why, Hank?
Where's the fun in that?

04:48.943 --> 04:50.951
No, it's not fun.
It's not fun at all.

04:50.984 --> 04:52.151
But I'm not a "funster"
right now.

04:52.184 --> 04:53.616
- [Laughs]
- I'm trying to be a producer.

04:53.657 --> 04:54.824
[Gasps] That's right.

04:54.857 --> 04:56.920
- You're a producer. Of course.
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.953 --> 04:57.992
Actually, I do need some help

04:58.025 --> 04:59.089
producing something
in my trailer.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.561
- You stop!
- [Laughs]

05:00.594 --> 05:02.633
I've got to talk to Rath
before we shoot the scene,

05:02.666 --> 05:04.297
and I don't want a boner
while I'm doing that.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.033
Fine.
Come by afterwards.

05:06.066 --> 05:08.431
There's a few lines
that need sharpening.

05:08.464 --> 05:10.199
It's more than a few.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.568
It's triage, Hank.

05:11.609 --> 05:13.376
We do what we can
in the time we have,

05:13.409 --> 05:15.006
and if we're lucky,

05:15.039 --> 05:18.079
we have some good old dirty fun
while we're at it.

05:18.112 --> 05:20.543
Gosh, you make it sound
so honorable.

05:20.576 --> 05:22.310
You know where to find me.

05:24.717 --> 05:28.219
- Not a good idea, my friend.
- What?

05:28.252 --> 05:29.913
That woman is
a fucking man-eater.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.154
The stories are legendary.

05:31.187 --> 05:33.155
I am staying strong, like bull.

05:33.188 --> 05:34.387
Do better than that, okay?

05:34.420 --> 05:35.756
You start fucking the actresses,

05:35.789 --> 05:37.459
the whole show is gonna
go down in flames.

05:37.492 --> 05:40.258
Trust me, I've been there,
a couple of times.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.867
I believe you.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.500
- Fun memories, though.
- Okay.

05:44.533 --> 05:47.805
Back to earth, where Hashtag
wants me to rewrite the scene.

05:47.838 --> 05:48.942
Fuck that!

05:48.975 --> 05:51.045
That's what I said, in my head.

05:51.078 --> 05:52.309
You're producing
the episode, Hank.

05:52.342 --> 05:53.645
You make the call.

05:53.678 --> 05:55.381
If they want to do something
stupid, don't let them.

05:55.414 --> 05:56.878
You tell them no.
It's that simple.

05:56.919 --> 05:59.350
It sounds simple
when--when you say it.

05:59.383 --> 06:00.783
All right, let me ask
you something.

06:00.823 --> 06:02.119
What?

06:02.152 --> 06:04.192
How do I get back
in Julia's good graces?

06:04.225 --> 06:05.528
I don't know, man.

06:05.561 --> 06:06.992
I think maybe you just got
to let it go for a while.

06:07.025 --> 06:08.296
You know, wait until--

06:08.329 --> 06:11.036
wait until we wrap
or get canceled.

06:11.069 --> 06:13.268
I don't know
if I can do that, you know?

06:13.309 --> 06:15.076
- She haunts my dreams.
- Yeah.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.077
Has she said anything about me?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.414
No, not really.

06:18.447 --> 06:20.750
You know, just...

06:20.783 --> 06:22.014
no.

06:22.047 --> 06:23.767
You're not sniffing
around there, are you?

06:23.784 --> 06:26.751
I mean, I would understand
the temptation if you were.

06:26.792 --> 06:29.330
You have the kid in common.
You both have private parts.

06:29.363 --> 06:31.898
I would imagine shit
could go down pretty easily.

06:31.931 --> 06:34.404
- Fuck, I got to go.
- Really? What? Where?

06:34.437 --> 06:37.101
What could be more fascinating
and important than this?

06:37.142 --> 06:39.037
I am sitting down
with Eddie Nero.

06:39.070 --> 06:41.375
The network's desperate
for some stunt casting.

06:41.408 --> 06:43.414
Well--well, give
that pansexual loon my best.

06:43.447 --> 06:44.550
I will.

06:44.583 --> 06:45.950
He took a man in his mouth,
you know.

06:45.983 --> 06:47.918
- Really?
- Yeah, it was research

06:47.951 --> 06:49.946
for a part.
He'll tell you all about it.

06:49.979 --> 06:52.951
He engineered that orgasm
with hands and feet.

06:52.984 --> 06:54.645
- Can't wait.
- Yeah.

06:54.678 --> 06:56.349
- Stay strong, Hank.
- [Groans]

06:56.382 --> 06:58.548
These are the times
that try a man's soul.

06:58.581 --> 07:00.588
Yeah.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.651
Psst! Psst!

07:07.825 --> 07:10.727
[Sighs heavily]

07:10.760 --> 07:12.893
- Ooh, ah.
- Hi.

07:12.926 --> 07:14.597
Let me guess, Rath, huh?

07:14.630 --> 07:15.756
Lovely.

07:15.797 --> 07:18.996
Gets my juices flowing.
How about yo--mm.

07:19.029 --> 07:21.435
Mm, well, I guess so.

07:21.468 --> 07:23.697
Hey, you're not just buttering
me up for notes, are you?

07:23.730 --> 07:25.096
- I do have one note.
- You do? What is it?

07:25.137 --> 07:26.464
- Shut up and fuck me.
- Wow!

07:26.505 --> 07:28.999
You really have caught
the boning bug, haven't you?

07:29.040 --> 07:30.532
Is there a problem with that?

07:30.565 --> 07:32.301
No, there's nothing wrong
with it at all. It's just--

07:32.334 --> 07:33.941
Do you have a problem
with single moms being sexual?

07:33.974 --> 07:35.404
I-I encourage single moms

07:35.436 --> 07:37.001
- to be highly sexual.
- Good. [Laughs]

07:37.042 --> 07:38.903
It's just that I wouldn't want
Levon to find out about it.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.102
Forget about Levon.

07:40.135 --> 07:41.501
Yes, but I don't want
to get his hopes up.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.739
Oh, just stay
in the moment, okay?

07:43.772 --> 07:46.674
Oh, my--
oh, my God!

07:46.706 --> 07:49.673
[Moaning] Oh, my God!

07:49.706 --> 07:52.574
[Moaning]

07:52.607 --> 07:54.575
Oh, my God.

07:54.615 --> 07:57.278
Oh, my God.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.517
Oh...
[Knock at door]

07:58.550 --> 08:00.213
Mom!
Is Hank in there?

08:00.246 --> 08:01.253
[Sighs]

08:01.286 --> 08:03.390
Fucking cock-blocker
strikes again.

08:03.424 --> 08:06.556
Oh.

08:06.589 --> 08:08.251
Hey, buddy.

08:08.292 --> 08:09.988
- What's going on?
- What?

08:10.029 --> 08:11.156
What do you mean?

08:11.196 --> 08:12.858
- You guys been messing around?
- What?

08:12.891 --> 08:14.561
Why would you--why would you--
why would you ask that?

08:14.594 --> 08:16.193
- [Laughs]
- Why would you think that?

08:16.226 --> 08:19.031
That is a weird fucking
question, dude, right?

08:19.064 --> 08:21.367
- No, it's not.
- It's fucked up.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.202
Yeah, well, the energy feels
all weird in here right now...

08:23.235 --> 08:24.706
- Does it?
- And your makeup's all screwy.

08:24.739 --> 08:26.876
- You look like a homeless hooker.
- Don't be silly, honey.

08:26.910 --> 08:28.710
I just have a few questions
about the scene.

08:28.743 --> 08:29.847
- Yeah.
- Really?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.783
- Can I help you?
- I need to talk to you.

08:31.816 --> 08:33.816
Okay, well, let's talk.

08:33.857 --> 08:34.950
I think we're good?

08:34.982 --> 08:36.462
Yeah, I just need
to fix up my makeup.

08:36.484 --> 08:37.881
- Get out of here.
- But you got--you know--

08:37.914 --> 08:39.482
yeah, okay.
All right, and you?

08:39.523 --> 08:41.785
[Giggles] Come back.

08:43.092 --> 08:44.726
I'm about to do my audition.

08:44.759 --> 08:46.360
Can--can you be in the room
when I do it?

08:46.367 --> 08:47.901
Ah, I don't have time
for that shit

08:47.934 --> 08:49.795
- right now, kid--sorry.
- Please?

08:49.828 --> 08:52.362
The casting director hates me.
She thinks it's just a favor.

08:52.403 --> 08:54.833
- It is just a favor.
- Yeah, I know.

08:54.866 --> 08:57.033
But at least this way
you can tell Rath you saw me

08:57.074 --> 08:58.370
and I was fucking awesome.

08:58.403 --> 09:00.741
I'm worried
that she'll tell him I suck,

09:00.774 --> 09:02.012
and he'll never see it.

09:02.045 --> 09:05.014
Five minutes--
that's all I ask.

09:16.425 --> 09:19.090
Hey, Hank.
Um, Hashtag's looking for you.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.227
Fuck, where is he?

09:20.260 --> 09:21.595
Around here somewhere.
I don't--

09:21.628 --> 09:23.395
All right, well, just tell him
I'm on set, all right?

09:23.437 --> 09:25.037
- Wait. That's a lie.
- So what?

09:25.070 --> 09:27.745
It's not the fucking boy scouts.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.484
You don't need
to sit in on this, Hank.

09:34.517 --> 09:37.956
Yet, here I am.
Let's get this party started.

09:37.989 --> 09:40.228
- Ready, Levon?
- [Sighs] Sure.

09:40.261 --> 09:42.430
Should--should I sit or stand?

09:42.463 --> 09:44.931
Totally up to you, hon.

09:44.964 --> 09:46.864
Relax, kid.
You're sweating like a pig.

09:46.897 --> 09:48.098
I know. I know.

09:48.131 --> 09:50.301
I'm really fucking nervous.
I'm sorry.

09:50.334 --> 09:52.273
[Exhales sharply]

09:52.306 --> 09:55.409
No, no, I don't know if that's
gonna help with the sweating.

09:55.442 --> 09:58.283
- Just--
- [Exhales sharply]

10:00.390 --> 10:02.088
- Oh, my God! Okay.
- You all right?

10:02.128 --> 10:03.393
- Man down.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:03.426 --> 10:04.763
I am so sorry.

10:04.797 --> 10:06.837
You know what? No problem.
Don't worry about it.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.702
You all right?

10:08.735 --> 10:11.038
Thank you.
Okay, it's just--

10:11.071 --> 10:13.143
- Levon, leave it.
- Great.

10:13.176 --> 10:14.909
- Sorry.
- No, not to worry.

10:14.942 --> 10:16.478
Have a seat.

10:16.511 --> 10:18.749
Okay.

10:18.783 --> 10:21.582
Slate for the camera.

10:23.455 --> 10:26.156
Hello.
I'm Levon Moody...

10:26.189 --> 10:28.156
Hey-o.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.463
Rep--represented
by Charles Runkle,

10:30.496 --> 10:32.063
the Runkle Agency.

10:32.096 --> 10:34.895
I'm reading for the part
of the kid.

10:34.936 --> 10:36.368
And I'm okay with nudity.

10:36.401 --> 10:38.800
No nudity required.

10:38.841 --> 10:40.812
I know. I'm just letting
you know I-I'm okay with it.

10:40.845 --> 10:42.812
I'm pretty happy
with my body right now.

10:42.845 --> 10:45.377
Great.
Okay, you ready?

10:45.410 --> 10:47.218
Yes.
Yes, I am.

10:47.251 --> 10:49.683
Yo, is your father home?

10:53.449 --> 10:54.689
[Mouths words]

10:54.722 --> 10:57.259
Oh...

10:57.292 --> 10:59.728
Who--who wants to know?

10:59.761 --> 11:00.791
Danko Jones is who.

11:00.824 --> 11:02.895
Get your old man out here, kid.

11:05.767 --> 11:08.198
[Farts]

11:08.231 --> 11:10.534
[Imitates farting] Excuse me.

11:10.567 --> 11:11.935
I'm sorry.

11:11.968 --> 11:13.872
I am so sorry.
I-I mean, excuse me.

11:13.905 --> 11:15.775
I-I have a really nervous tummy
right now.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.206
- Can--can I do that again?
- [Imitates farting, laughs]

11:18.239 --> 11:19.846
You know what?
I think we got it.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.582
[Knock at door, door opens]

11:21.615 --> 11:23.648
Sorry.
Uh, he didn't believe me, Hank.

11:23.681 --> 11:26.123
- He's coming up the stairs.
- Fuck!

11:26.156 --> 11:27.556
- That was great, kid.
- It stinks in here.

11:27.589 --> 11:29.027
It would have been better

11:29.060 --> 11:32.533
without that one-cheek sneak,
but right up until then, aces.

11:34.030 --> 11:35.597
- Hey. Sorry.
- Oh, hey, Hank.

11:35.630 --> 11:37.036
No, you do not have
to apologize.

11:37.069 --> 11:38.838
I'm just--
I got to wait for Hashtag.

11:38.871 --> 11:40.343
- He's just, you know--
- Oh, sit down. Stay.

11:40.376 --> 11:41.810
You want a water?

11:41.843 --> 11:43.482
Sure. I'm--I'm a little parched.

11:43.515 --> 11:45.313
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

11:45.346 --> 11:47.346
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

11:49.421 --> 11:51.293
- Oh, look at you.
- [Laughs]

11:51.326 --> 11:53.294
You kind of feel it, don't you?

11:53.327 --> 11:54.831
Mm, mm-hmm.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.128
What?

11:56.168 --> 11:57.448
You know, like,
the us of it all.

11:57.465 --> 11:59.105
- Oh, that!
Both: Yeah.

11:59.138 --> 12:00.137
So much tension.

12:00.170 --> 12:02.041
- Right, right.
- You know, just--

12:02.074 --> 12:03.442
ever since you started
working here...

12:03.476 --> 12:04.708
- Mm-hmm.
- This job has just gotten

12:04.748 --> 12:06.212
to be so much more fun,
you know,

12:06.245 --> 12:07.611
like, exponentially more fun.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.579
Well, you know,
I-I try to be additive.

12:09.612 --> 12:11.451
Yeah. Yeah, it's just nice

12:11.484 --> 12:13.450
to have some real male energy
around here.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.785
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- You know, Rath--he's cool.

12:14.818 --> 12:15.920
He's great and all,

12:15.953 --> 12:17.784
but, you know,
he's just so closed off.

12:17.825 --> 12:19.992
Yeah, I do find him
emotionally unavailable.

12:20.025 --> 12:21.559
- Oh, totally.
- Mm, yeah.

12:21.592 --> 12:23.295
And you don't know what
it's like to sit next to Hugh.

12:23.328 --> 12:24.358
- Oh, I do.
- He's just--

12:24.391 --> 12:25.756
Yeah, it's excruciating.

12:25.789 --> 12:28.723
Yeah, so I just want you
to know that I am into it...

12:28.764 --> 12:29.795
- All right.
- If you are.

12:29.828 --> 12:30.899
Well, into what exactly?

12:30.932 --> 12:32.164
You know, like
an interoffice romance...

12:32.197 --> 12:33.469
- Oh, okay, you know what?
- You know, some kind

12:33.502 --> 12:34.638
- of a thing like--you know?
- [Laughs]

12:34.671 --> 12:36.303
- Oh.
- Yeah, you know what, jade?

12:36.336 --> 12:37.905
- Oh.
- I got an idea.

12:37.946 --> 12:39.409
Let's not,
and pleasure ourselves

12:39.442 --> 12:40.678
to the thought that we did.

12:40.712 --> 12:42.005
Oh, a little naughty.

12:42.046 --> 12:44.141
Yes, I took
the sexual harassment seminar.

12:44.182 --> 12:46.381
- Or I bribed Hugh to take it...
- Uh-huh.

12:46.414 --> 12:48.014
With a sprinkles gift card,
you know?

12:48.047 --> 12:49.317
And I just don't think

12:49.350 --> 12:51.918
that my handsome ten inches
is worth the trouble.

12:51.951 --> 12:53.086
You know what they say--

12:53.119 --> 12:54.560
a moment on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.

12:54.593 --> 12:57.758
- It doesn't really make sense.
- Oh, I am making you flustered!

12:57.791 --> 12:59.798
[Laughs] Aren't I?

12:59.831 --> 13:00.926
Yes, you are.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.534
Come on, it would be so fun,
you know.

13:02.567 --> 13:04.430
And it's not love or anything,
you know?

13:04.463 --> 13:05.670
- No, no.
- But you are definitely

13:05.703 --> 13:07.167
the hottest guy in the room.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.705
Well, that's--that's not
really saying much, is it?

13:08.738 --> 13:10.377
Oh, I mean, and it's safe to say

13:10.410 --> 13:12.114
that I'm the hottest girl
in the room.

13:12.147 --> 13:13.378
Well, you are.
You are...

13:13.411 --> 13:15.314
- except for Terry, of course.
- Of course!

13:15.347 --> 13:16.313
- Right.
- Yeah.

13:16.346 --> 13:17.383
Terry is pretty ho--

13:17.416 --> 13:18.815
what is the deal
with him, anyway?

13:18.848 --> 13:19.983
I haven't been able to get
the straight story from anybody.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.151
Yeah, I'm not really sure.

13:21.184 --> 13:23.054
Everyone says one thing,
and then he says anoth--

13:23.087 --> 13:24.349
- Yep.
- Oh! Oh, hey.

13:24.382 --> 13:26.586
- Hank, your manager's here.
- Oh, awesome.

13:26.619 --> 13:27.985
All right, well,
you think about it, Hank.

13:28.018 --> 13:29.819
I will, "Jarde."

13:29.859 --> 13:31.556
- [Laughs]
- Think about what?

13:31.589 --> 13:33.292
None of your
fucking business, Hugh.

13:33.325 --> 13:34.564
Get out of here.

13:34.597 --> 13:37.460
Close the door.

13:37.501 --> 13:39.164
[Sighs]

13:39.197 --> 13:41.640
- Jade's pretty cute, huh?
- Totes.

13:41.673 --> 13:43.747
I'm trying to get the nerve
to ask her out.

13:43.780 --> 13:46.347
You should do that.
You should do that right now.

13:46.381 --> 13:47.942
- Yeah, you think I have a shot?
- Yeah.

13:47.947 --> 13:49.982
We're always the last
to know, aren't we?

13:50.015 --> 13:52.812
She is totally warm
for your pear-shaped form, dude.

13:52.845 --> 13:54.318
Trust.

13:54.351 --> 13:56.885
What's up, sweet cheeks?
What are you doing here?

13:56.918 --> 13:59.085
I came to support
my most important client

13:59.118 --> 14:01.254
as he produces his very first
episode of television.

14:01.295 --> 14:03.157
Yeah, it's really
kind of an imposition, Charlie.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.428
I don't have time to babysit

14:04.461 --> 14:06.193
your pale, pockmarked
ass right now.

14:06.226 --> 14:08.507
Actually, I kind of need
to talk to you about something.

14:08.532 --> 14:09.613
Of course it's about you.

14:09.629 --> 14:11.230
I should have figured
that out sooner.

14:11.271 --> 14:13.238
I'm in a really bad way
right now, Hank.

14:13.271 --> 14:15.805
What is it--still
with the uncooperative ween?

14:15.838 --> 14:17.606
No, that's working
pretty well now, actually.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.639
Well, that's great!

14:19.680 --> 14:22.079
- Right?
- Not exactly.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.544
Come on, Charlie,
I don't have all day.

14:23.585 --> 14:25.753
I got to meet Karen
for a drink later on.

14:25.786 --> 14:28.014
A drink with Karen--
what's that all about?

14:28.055 --> 14:29.751
Everything
is so fucking crazy right now,

14:29.784 --> 14:32.288
I don't feel like I can make
the right move to save my life,

14:32.321 --> 14:33.958
and she centers me, you know?

14:33.991 --> 14:36.293
I could use some centering
myself right now.

14:36.327 --> 14:38.629
Okay.
All right, buddy, out with it.

14:38.662 --> 14:39.964
- [Sighs]
- What is it?

14:39.997 --> 14:43.672
Stu has offered me
a million dollars

14:43.705 --> 14:45.272
to let him fuck Marcy again.

14:45.305 --> 14:47.136
[Laughs] You're kidding?

14:47.169 --> 14:48.875
- I'm not kidding.
- That is fucked up, Charlie.

14:48.908 --> 14:49.916
I know!

14:49.949 --> 14:51.920
You're not gonna do it, are you?

14:51.953 --> 14:53.783
I don't know yet.

14:53.824 --> 14:56.119
Marcy really wants the money.

14:56.152 --> 14:59.395
- We could really use the cash.
- Wow.

14:59.428 --> 15:01.395
You know, I-I would never
be okay with somebody

15:01.428 --> 15:03.133
fucking Karen
for a million dollars.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.775
I mean, I had to put up
with Bates banging her

15:04.808 --> 15:07.309
for that whole time, and
I didn't even get paid for it.

15:07.342 --> 15:08.941
And who knows what kind
of nasty shit

15:08.974 --> 15:10.675
is swimming around
that guy's urethra?

15:10.708 --> 15:13.338
He's probably got the avian flu
swimming around in his semen.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.515
- Back to me, okay?
- Sure. What?

15:15.548 --> 15:17.681
All right,
slightly complicating matters

15:17.714 --> 15:20.715
is the fact that every
single time we discuss it,

15:20.748 --> 15:23.220
we get incredibly turned on
and end up fucking.

15:23.253 --> 15:25.186
What the fuck is wrong
with you two?

15:25.219 --> 15:26.893
I don't know.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.631
I'll tell you what's wrong
with you and your dick, Charlie.

15:28.664 --> 15:30.144
It's that deep down,
you don't believe

15:30.167 --> 15:31.396
that you deserve to be happy.

15:31.429 --> 15:32.701
That's your fucking problem.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.295
You got to tell your dick
that it's okay

15:34.303 --> 15:35.767
to live happily ever after.

15:35.808 --> 15:38.469
- Speak of the fucking devil.
- The handsome devil.

15:38.501 --> 15:40.203
How's everything going
on the stage?

15:40.236 --> 15:41.371
It's a fucking nightmare, Stu.

15:41.404 --> 15:44.169
- Care to lend a hand?
- Oh, God, no.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.811
I'm what they call a
"hands-off executive producer."

15:46.844 --> 15:48.379
Except when it comes
to the money, right?

15:48.412 --> 15:49.546
Oh, but of course.

15:49.579 --> 15:51.178
Oh, speaking of money,

15:51.211 --> 15:52.881
I'm gonna be putting a clock

15:52.914 --> 15:55.152
on that offer
I made you, Charlie.

15:55.185 --> 15:57.088
I think you know which one
I'm talking about.

15:57.121 --> 15:59.320
Yeah, we know all about
your indecent proposal, Stu.

15:59.353 --> 16:01.025
Well, I think
it is very decent--

16:01.058 --> 16:03.058
- Oh! Oh-ho!
- Oh!

16:03.091 --> 16:04.530
- My man, butterbean!
- Oh!

16:04.563 --> 16:05.995
- Champion!
- Jesus!

16:06.028 --> 16:07.964
Runkle, are you
out of your mind?

16:07.997 --> 16:09.637
You insulted my man's pride.

16:09.670 --> 16:10.973
- That's right.
- Insulted him?

16:11.006 --> 16:12.501
I made a very generous offer,

16:12.542 --> 16:15.037
and I think it speaks
to the depth

16:15.078 --> 16:17.575
of my feelings for Marcy
that the offer still stands,

16:17.616 --> 16:21.848
in spite of this completely
unwarranted aggression.

16:21.889 --> 16:24.017
Hashtag's looking for you, Hank.

16:24.058 --> 16:27.921
What the fuck does
that asshole want now?

16:27.962 --> 16:30.993
He's standing right behind me,
isn't he?

16:32.267 --> 16:33.507
I thought we was friends, Moody.

16:33.529 --> 16:35.166
We are, Hashtag.
We are.

16:35.199 --> 16:37.062
It's just--it's--
I'm in such a frenzy here,

16:37.095 --> 16:40.569
and this bitch is running off
the rails as we speak.

16:40.602 --> 16:42.472
Come on, walk with me.

16:42.505 --> 16:44.544
Man, what the fuck is up
with that motherfucker?

16:44.577 --> 16:45.809
Which one?

16:45.842 --> 16:47.979
The one whose gender confuses
the shit out of me.

16:48.012 --> 16:50.822
- Terry, yep.
- Yeah, Terry.

16:50.855 --> 16:52.391
What's the deal
with that lady-dude?

16:52.424 --> 16:53.961
I haven't been able to get
a straight answer.

16:53.994 --> 16:55.897
- I don't know.
- You smoke weed?

16:55.930 --> 16:58.435
- I most certainly do.
- Smoke with me.

16:58.468 --> 17:00.933
- Vaporizer.
- I will.

17:04.742 --> 17:06.477
Level with me, Moody.

17:06.511 --> 17:08.877
- You think I got what it takes?
- What it takes?

17:08.910 --> 17:10.382
Yeah, to handle superstardom.

17:10.415 --> 17:14.719
Sure. Why not, Hashtag?
You're as cool as they come.

17:14.752 --> 17:17.919
I present myself that way,
but I don't know, man.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.128
It's like, sometimes
I want to go back to the clubs,

17:20.162 --> 17:21.729
you know, make motherfuckers
laugh their asses off,

17:21.762 --> 17:23.634
- you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I get it.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.969
Sometimes I want to go back
to my childhood bedroom

17:26.002 --> 17:28.065
and write a short story
and then pleasure myself

17:28.106 --> 17:31.198
to my trusty old copy
of <i>Penthouse Letters.</i>

17:31.239 --> 17:33.007
You know,
if this shit flops, right,

17:33.040 --> 17:34.977
my face is on every billboard.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.880
That's why I'm so particular
about my shit.

17:36.913 --> 17:38.709
I-I understand.
It's just--

17:38.742 --> 17:40.212
I wouldn't steer you wrong,
Hashtag.

17:40.245 --> 17:44.278
So what you think
about Amy Taylor Walsh?

17:44.319 --> 17:45.814
Very talented.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.455
Yeah, yeah,
she's a good actor and all.

17:47.488 --> 17:49.954
I'm saying, like, you know,
she's crazy hot, right?

17:49.995 --> 17:52.115
Hey, why don't you write me
a scene where me and her--

17:52.131 --> 17:53.499
like, we're just making out.

17:53.532 --> 17:55.436
I mean, I don't care if it's,
like, a dream sequence.

17:55.469 --> 17:56.500
That way,
if the show get canceled,

17:56.533 --> 17:57.500
at least I'll have that.

17:57.531 --> 17:59.033
I could do that for you,
Hashtag,

17:59.066 --> 18:01.166
but I think the third episode
is too soon, you know?

18:01.199 --> 18:03.568
I trust your instincts.

18:03.601 --> 18:05.272
I thought you were into Julia.

18:05.305 --> 18:08.111
Nah, Julia, man--
it's too complicated.

18:08.144 --> 18:09.836
You got a kid with her.
Rath digs her.

18:09.877 --> 18:11.275
[Clicks tongue] I'm good, man.

18:11.308 --> 18:13.275
I'm not trying to have a project
on my hands, you feel me?

18:13.308 --> 18:16.075
- Copy that, motherfucker.
- [Laughs]

18:16.116 --> 18:17.379
Yeah, man.

18:17.412 --> 18:18.652
You know, I'm happy
we had this talk.

18:18.685 --> 18:20.380
I feel like we connected
on a human level.

18:20.421 --> 18:21.515
Me too.

18:21.548 --> 18:23.587
- I really respect your writing.
- Thank you.

18:23.620 --> 18:26.018
And I really respect
your taste in weed.

18:26.052 --> 18:28.491
Hey, we can smoke anytime.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.259
Boys! Ah!

18:30.292 --> 18:32.659
- [Laughs] What up? What up?
- Oh, whoo!

18:32.692 --> 18:34.426
Hey, y'all got
some pitches for me?

18:34.467 --> 18:36.531
Yeah!
Yo, man, we got a phone book

18:36.564 --> 18:38.467
full of funny shit right here,
brother, right here.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.866
We're shitting jokes
on the walk over here, boy.

18:39.899 --> 18:41.136
Shitting jokes?
Shitting jokes!

18:41.169 --> 18:42.938
What? What? What?
[Laughter]

18:42.971 --> 18:44.738
Shit them jokes!
Hey, fuck exposition, right?

18:44.771 --> 18:46.537
Wait, wait, hold it.
What are you talking about?

18:46.578 --> 18:48.902
Oh, I had them rewrite the
scene, you know what I'm saying?

18:48.943 --> 18:50.971
- Punch it up, make it funny.
- My--my scene?

18:51.004 --> 18:52.876
The one I wrote,
the one we're about to shoot?

18:52.909 --> 18:54.212
I mean, you said
you didn't want to rewrite it,

18:54.245 --> 18:56.442
so I had these boys come in,
you know, make it funny.

18:56.475 --> 18:58.547
And plus, you know what?
You're not a comedy writer.

18:58.580 --> 19:01.181
But I'm witty, right?
[Laughter]

19:01.222 --> 19:04.255
- Sorry, Moody.
- I still love you, Moody.

19:04.288 --> 19:06.496
Amy Taylor Walsh
wants to see you...

19:06.529 --> 19:08.632
- in her trailer.
- Lovely.

19:08.665 --> 19:10.001
Do you want me to chaperone?

19:10.034 --> 19:11.994
I do have a lot of experience
with these weirdoes.

19:12.003 --> 19:14.340
That is a kind offer,
Terry, but--

19:14.373 --> 19:15.476
but, no, thank you.

19:15.510 --> 19:17.742
But--but can I ask
you something?

19:17.775 --> 19:21.014
Yes.

19:21.047 --> 19:23.885
Never mind.

19:23.919 --> 19:25.620
Forget it.

19:33.987 --> 19:36.795
[Knock at door]
Come in.

19:40.997 --> 19:42.101
Wowza.

19:42.134 --> 19:44.531
Just wanted your thoughts
on my wardrobe.

19:44.572 --> 19:46.171
- Huh.
- What do you think?

19:46.204 --> 19:48.106
I think it looks great.

19:48.139 --> 19:50.138
Is--is there another option?

19:50.171 --> 19:51.738
Nope.
[Laughs]

19:51.771 --> 19:54.745
I just really wanted you to see
me in my lacy underthings.

19:54.778 --> 19:57.778
Mission accomplished,
and thank you for that.

19:57.811 --> 19:59.480
You're welcome.

19:59.512 --> 20:01.478
You know, I do need
to fix something.

20:01.511 --> 20:04.719
- What is that?
- This.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.484
- Mm.
- There, done.

20:09.517 --> 20:11.187
What--what exactly
did you fix?

20:11.220 --> 20:13.088
I just--I didn't think
it was right

20:13.121 --> 20:15.320
that you'd gone down on me,
and we hadn't even kissed yet.

20:15.353 --> 20:16.423
Oh, you're right.

20:16.456 --> 20:18.124
That does seem
a little improper.

20:18.158 --> 20:19.723
- Mm-hmm.
- Absolutely right.

20:19.757 --> 20:21.553
Yeah, very.

20:21.586 --> 20:23.456
Oh, you--ooh, you know what,
Amy Taylor Walsh?

20:23.488 --> 20:25.056
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

20:25.089 --> 20:29.831
and suggest that perhaps
this is not the best of ideas.

20:29.864 --> 20:31.359
Why is that?

20:31.400 --> 20:36.030
Because these are the times
that try men's souls.

20:36.063 --> 20:37.835
[Laughs]
Is that what I'm doing?

20:37.868 --> 20:40.432
- Yeah.
- Am I trying your soul?

20:40.465 --> 20:43.333
- Among other things.
- [Chuckles]

20:45.634 --> 20:48.370
Mm.
Are you high?

20:48.403 --> 20:50.902
Um, a little bit more
than I'd like to be.

20:50.935 --> 20:54.598
Hmm.
Who'd you get high with?

20:54.639 --> 20:57.538
[Door opens] Amy Taylor Walsh!

20:57.571 --> 21:00.106
What the--
what the--

21:00.139 --> 21:02.105
- What the fuck is this shit?
- What the fuck?

21:02.138 --> 21:03.858
You can't just come busting
into my trailer!

21:03.873 --> 21:05.105
Lock the fucking door.

21:05.146 --> 21:07.409
I wasn't expecting
any fucking visitors.

21:07.442 --> 21:09.114
- Listen, I'm gonna go--
- This is my joint, okay?

21:09.147 --> 21:11.115
I'm number one
on the call sheet!

21:11.148 --> 21:13.156
I don't give a shit
what number you are,

21:13.189 --> 21:14.525
I'm not gonna fuck you, Hashtag.

21:14.558 --> 21:15.892
Well, you making a mistake,

21:15.925 --> 21:17.922
'cause bitches love me,
and I need an on-set romance!

21:17.955 --> 21:19.753
Go fuck an extra!
That's what they're for.

21:19.794 --> 21:22.789
- I'm too pretty for that.
- Get out!

21:22.822 --> 21:24.125
Bullshit!
[Door slams]

21:24.158 --> 21:26.692
Can you believe how
unprofessional some people are?

21:26.725 --> 21:27.995
- So unprofessional.
- So crazy.

21:28.028 --> 21:29.363
[Door opens]

21:29.396 --> 21:31.427
Moody,
I can't believe this, man.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.929
After the talk we had?
This is bullshit.

21:33.962 --> 21:35.495
Get out.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.096
They're ready on set.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.504
All right,
let's make some television!

21:46.502 --> 21:48.634
- Are you on your way?
- Yeah, I'm on my way.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.368
- How about you?
- I will be, shortly...

21:51.409 --> 21:52.575
very shortly.

21:52.608 --> 21:53.838
We just got to rehearse
this scene.

21:53.871 --> 21:55.806
- 30 minutes or less.
- Oh, Hank.

21:55.839 --> 21:58.007
I don't want to wait
for what already promises

21:58.047 --> 22:00.110
to be a pretty
unpleasant conversation.

22:00.143 --> 22:01.644
Why you got to be like that?

22:01.677 --> 22:03.516
I'm looking forward to this.
And thank you.

22:03.549 --> 22:05.149
- Thank you for doing it.
- It's okay.

22:05.183 --> 22:06.582
You know, I just want to talk

22:06.616 --> 22:09.116
about how and when you plan
to tell Becca

22:09.149 --> 22:11.154
about all the shiny, new people
in your life,

22:11.187 --> 22:12.554
and then--and then
I want to go, okay?

22:12.587 --> 22:13.785
I want to go home.

22:13.818 --> 22:15.655
- Deal?
- Deal.

22:15.688 --> 22:17.358
But I just got to see you smile

22:17.391 --> 22:20.424
before you go home, okay?
One time?

22:20.456 --> 22:22.126
I can't make any promises.

22:22.159 --> 22:24.458
Perfect. I wouldn't want it
any other way.

22:24.491 --> 22:26.528
I'll see you soon.

22:35.463 --> 22:36.903
- I thought you could use this.
- Oh.

22:36.998 --> 22:38.997
Thanks, kid, you read my mind.

22:39.038 --> 22:41.404
How did I do?
Was I any good?

22:41.436 --> 22:43.705
I don't really remember it,
except for the fart,

22:43.738 --> 22:46.536
which was good--
solid, solid fart.

22:46.569 --> 22:48.840
Yeah, it was fucking
embarrassing, though.

22:48.873 --> 22:50.304
It was memorable.

22:50.345 --> 22:52.838
You were right.
Eddie Nero is a fucking psycho.

22:52.878 --> 22:54.803
I mean, the guy wouldn't stop
talking about you

22:54.844 --> 22:56.370
and taking a man in his mouth.

22:56.411 --> 22:59.070
I think what he really wants
is to take you in his mouth.

22:59.103 --> 23:01.036
Oh, well, it's always nice
to be wanted.

23:01.076 --> 23:02.674
Yeah.
How's it going?

23:02.707 --> 23:04.737
Not great.

23:04.777 --> 23:06.545
- Are you stoned?
- Huh?

23:06.578 --> 23:09.145
- Are you stoned?
- Not as much as I'd like to be.

23:09.178 --> 23:11.311
- And try one.
- We'll just try it.

23:11.344 --> 23:13.677
- Will you just listen?
- And action.

23:13.710 --> 23:15.077
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

23:15.118 --> 23:17.408
You got the right
to remain sexy.

23:17.441 --> 23:18.678
Oh, come on!

23:18.711 --> 23:22.044
And anything you say
will be held against me.

23:22.077 --> 23:23.716
One time, do it like the script--once.

23:23.749 --> 23:26.577
Do you understand the kisses
that's coming out of my mouth?

23:26.610 --> 23:29.050
What the fuck is this?
Cut!

23:29.083 --> 23:31.554
Who the hell is yelling "Cut"
on my se--oh, sorry.

23:31.587 --> 23:33.217
I call "Cut" when I see the inmates

23:33.258 --> 23:34.288
running the fucking asylum!

23:34.321 --> 23:36.222
Hank, what's going on here, man?

23:36.255 --> 23:38.051
I think Hashtag is just
working some shit

23:38.084 --> 23:40.218
through his system,
and--and, you know,

23:40.251 --> 23:42.058
we're gonna circle back
and get it all.

23:42.091 --> 23:43.427
- It's gonna be fine.
- You're the adult.

23:43.460 --> 23:44.956
You have to babysit them,

23:44.997 --> 23:46.531
or they're gonna
rollerblade all over you.

23:46.564 --> 23:48.699
Wait, wait, wait.
Moody's your idea of an adult...

23:48.732 --> 23:50.395
when he's sticking his pecker
in all the female actresses?

23:50.436 --> 23:51.468
For real?

23:51.501 --> 23:53.173
Okay, let's not rehash
ancient history.

23:53.206 --> 23:54.804
That was weeks ago.
We're past that.

23:54.837 --> 23:55.868
Now let's deal with this.

23:55.909 --> 23:58.109
Oh, no, it was five minutes ago!

23:58.142 --> 23:59.845
I caught him macking
on Amy Taylor Walsh.

23:59.878 --> 24:01.411
What the fuck did I tell you?

24:01.444 --> 24:02.507
- You were macking on her?
- [Sighs]

24:02.548 --> 24:04.412
- What does "macking" mean?
- Nothing.

24:04.445 --> 24:06.084
It means, like, making out.

24:06.117 --> 24:08.855
You were--you were macking on
her when you were inside of me?

24:08.888 --> 24:10.689
- Julia, hold on.
- Wait. You were inside her?

24:10.719 --> 24:12.421
- What the fuck, man?
- That didn't happen.

24:12.454 --> 24:13.789
May I suggest a sidebar?

24:13.822 --> 24:16.326
See, I-I should have trusted
my gut with you.

24:16.359 --> 24:18.198
I never should have hired you.
I was right.

24:18.231 --> 24:20.935
You are a fucking toddler
with a toxic personality.

24:20.968 --> 24:22.537
Wait. Does this mean you guys
are getting back together?

24:22.570 --> 24:24.001
'Cause that would be incredible.

24:24.042 --> 24:25.470
It's like the world's greatest
fucking love story.

24:25.503 --> 24:26.869
I can't believe
I'm playing second fiddle

24:26.902 --> 24:28.204
to a fucking guest star.

24:28.237 --> 24:30.374
- Come on, really?
- That's not very nice.

24:30.407 --> 24:32.711
Look, I'm not trying
to be a bitch.

24:32.744 --> 24:34.279
- I'm--
- Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

24:34.312 --> 24:35.909
Time-out, time-out.
What's the rules?

24:35.950 --> 24:37.582
She said "bitch."
I can't say "bitch"?

24:37.615 --> 24:39.383
Nobody's talking to you!

24:39.416 --> 24:40.950
- A woman can say it. Exactly.
- Oh, women can say it?

24:40.984 --> 24:42.488
I'm sorry. I just--
I'm feeling slightly used.

24:42.521 --> 24:44.626
That's all it was. Sorry.
I know the feeling.

24:44.659 --> 24:46.226
You knew I liked her. Where's
your fucking sense of honor?

24:46.259 --> 24:48.929
This guy--he has no honor
and no shame!

24:48.962 --> 24:50.563
Watch it, you fucking worm.
You want that stink finger?

24:50.604 --> 24:52.139
'Cause I'll fucking give it
to you!

24:52.172 --> 24:53.706
All right, you know what?
You're fucking fired.

24:53.739 --> 24:56.099
Take your fucking stink fingers
and get the fuck off my set,

24:56.106 --> 24:57.473
before you give
somebody pinkeye!

24:57.506 --> 24:58.976
Okay, excuse me.

24:59.009 --> 25:00.473
Whose set is this?

25:00.506 --> 25:02.210
You want to fire someone,
you got to go through me.

25:02.243 --> 25:04.807
- I'm an executive producer.
- In name only.

25:04.848 --> 25:06.480
- Can I fire him?
- No!

25:06.513 --> 25:08.679
You're lucky I live to shoot.

25:08.712 --> 25:10.948
- Rath, look, it's complicated.
- It's not complicated.

25:10.981 --> 25:13.049
I asked you, "Are you okay
with me pursuing her?"

25:13.082 --> 25:14.585
- Yes.
- You said you were, right?

25:14.618 --> 25:15.953
- Yes, yes.
- Then you move in on her?

25:15.986 --> 25:17.681
- What the fuck is that?
- I didn't move in on her.

25:17.721 --> 25:19.184
But it's like you said--

25:19.217 --> 25:21.523
we share a kid.
We both have private parts.

25:21.556 --> 25:23.059
Shit happens.

25:23.092 --> 25:25.026
And I'm not--I'm not gonna
apologize for any of this shit.

25:25.059 --> 25:26.456
It's none of your business
who she fucks

25:26.497 --> 25:29.758
or who she doesn't fuck,
'cause it's up to her.

25:29.791 --> 25:31.628
She doesn't exist to service us.

25:31.661 --> 25:34.259
We're lucky she even looks
in our direction occasionally.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.635
Oh, I want to be mad at you,
but then you're so sweet!

25:36.668 --> 25:39.529
I know.
What a fucking asshole.

25:39.570 --> 25:42.431
- What the--
- Okay, back to work!

25:42.464 --> 25:44.303
Let's do the fucking scene,
all right?

25:44.336 --> 25:46.102
If there is so much
as a comma out of place,

25:46.135 --> 25:49.437
we stay all night
until we get it!

25:49.470 --> 25:52.476
This isn't the fucking
Improv Olympics, all right?

25:52.509 --> 25:54.874
It's Rick Rath's
finishing school for assholes,

25:54.907 --> 25:57.808
where the script is innocent
until proven guilty!

25:57.841 --> 26:00.849
[Cell phone ringing]

26:03.848 --> 26:06.447
Karen, I am so sorry.
I'm on my way.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.521
Hank, it's Marcy.

26:08.554 --> 26:10.487
Marcy, what are you doing
with Karen's phone?

26:10.521 --> 26:12.558
And what's this I hear
about you fucking Stu for money?

26:12.591 --> 26:14.087
Hank, shut up and listen to me.

26:14.128 --> 26:16.150
I got to try to get through this
without crying.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.746
I'm at the hospital.

26:18.866 --> 26:22.504
Karen was in a car accident.

26:29.608 --> 26:32.605
[Engine turning]
