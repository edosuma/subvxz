[ Sighs ] I understand
nothing anymore. Nothing !

11:27.280 --> 11:29.400
Why ?

11:29.440 --> 11:32.640

Why ?

11:32.680 --> 11:37.280
Can you explain ?
Can anyone explain ?

12:03.480 --> 12:05.880

- Oh, Axel.

[ Steven ] Oh, hell, I hope
he didn't break an axle.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.760
I wouldn't want
to take advantage of you.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.080
It's a million-to-one shot
against a sure thing.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.000
- There's no such thing as a sure thing.
- Yeah.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.920

a scarf with a tuxedo.
- [ Speaking Russian ]

20:07.320 --> 20:10.240
- You tryin' to look like a prince ?
- What do you mean "trying" ?

The whole thing, it's crazy.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.240
I'll tell ya one thing.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.000
If I found out my life
had to end up in the mountains,

20:42.040 --> 20:43.920
I'd be all right.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.720
But it has to be
in your mind.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.640
What ?

20:49.680 --> 20:51.520
One shot ?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.560
Two is pussy.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.840
I don't think about one shot
that much anymore, Mike.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.440
You have to think about one shot.
One shot is what it's all about.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.360
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.

They don't listen.

The way the trees are.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.800

I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy
I go huntin' with, you know ?

21:41.920 --> 21:44.920

49:24.160 --> 49:26.960
I never really did it
with Angela, Nicky.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.520
Great. That's great.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.720
That's my last one true secret.

49:36.800 --> 49:39.360
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Just forget about it.

49:39.400 --> 49:42.200
- Angela, Angela !

49:45.000 --> 49:46.840
Oh, Angela.

49:46.920 --> 49:48.760
What am I gonna do
when she has the baby ?

49:48.840 --> 49:50.680
- That's Angela's part, right ?
- That's right.

49:50.760 --> 49:52.600
- Just hang loose.
- Hang loose ?

49:52.640 --> 49:54.560
Be happy.

49:54.640 --> 49:57.400
Go on. Get out of here.
We don't wanna see you anymore.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.320
[ Axel ]
Look at this maniac.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.400
I'll see you Monday
on the train.

50:03.480 --> 50:06.880
- Hey.
- Drive carefully.

50:06.920 --> 50:11.160
- You didn't know that
about Angela, huh ? Right ?
- Oh, that's bullshit.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.480
- Oh, it's bullshit, right ? Yeah ?
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.400
- I happen to know it's true.
- That's bullshit.

50:15.440 --> 50:17.320
-I happen to know it's true. All right ?
-You're full of bullshit.

50:17.360 --> 50:20.360
- Do you wanna bet ?
Put your money where your mouth is.
- Yeah. Bullshit.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.320
- Go fuck yourself, Stan.
- Huh ? Go fuck yourself.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.240
- Fuck you.
- Ah, grow up.

50:26.240 --> 50:30.000
[ Steven ]
Hey ! Hey ! All right !

50:41.640 --> 50:44.960
[ Angela ]
Michael, Michael, what are you doing ?

50:45.040 --> 50:49.000
- Mike ! Hey, Mike !
- Michael !

50:49.080 --> 50:53.160
[ Angela ]
Michael, what the hell are you doing ?

50:53.240 --> 50:56.200
- Michael !
- Hey !

50:56.240 --> 50:59.280
Michael, what the hell
are you doing ? Michael !

50:59.360 --> 51:02.720
- Hey, hey, hey !
- [ Axel ] Fuck it !

51:02.760 --> 51:07.320
Michael, come back here !
What the hell is he doing ?

51:07.360 --> 51:09.480
[ Angela ]
Michael, what the hell are you doing ?

51:09.560 --> 51:11.400
- [ Nick ] Hey, Mike !
- [ Angela ] Michael, come back here !

51:11.480 --> 51:13.320
[ Angela ]
Come here, Michael !

51:13.400 --> 51:15.760
[ Angela ] You know we love you !
Get back here !

51:15.800 --> 51:20.360
[ Nick ] Hey, Mike !
I gotta talk to you !

51:28.720 --> 51:30.880
Mike !

51:37.600 --> 51:39.480
Hey !

52:03.280 --> 52:05.120
Shit !

52:07.440 --> 52:09.920
I must be out of
my fuckin' mind.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.800
I must be out of my mind.

52:16.960 --> 52:19.720
I don't know.
Everything's going so fast.

52:19.800 --> 52:22.600
Man, oh, man.

52:22.680 --> 52:24.520
Hey, Nick.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.720
Think we'll ever come back ?

52:28.800 --> 52:30.640
- From Nam ?
- Yeah.

52:33.960 --> 52:36.120
You know something ?

52:36.200 --> 52:41.240
The whole thing,
it's right here.

52:41.320 --> 52:43.160
I love this fuckin' place.

52:43.240 --> 52:45.240
- You're crazy, man.
- I know that sounds crazy.

52:45.280 --> 52:49.280
If anything happens, Mike,
don't leave me over there.

52:49.320 --> 52:51.960
You got-- You gotta--
Just don't leave me.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.800
- You gotta promise me that, Mike.
- Hey.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.200
No, man, you got--
you gotta--

52:58.280 --> 53:01.400
You gotta promise definitely.

53:01.480 --> 53:03.480
- Hey, Nicky.
- Huh ?

53:03.520 --> 53:07.160
- You got it, pal.
- Promise ?

53:47.200 --> 53:50.080
* Shout Geronimo, Geronimo *

53:50.160 --> 53:53.080
* It's a silk and check your canopy
and take a look around *

53:53.120 --> 53:56.160
* The air is filled with troopers
set for battle on the ground *

53:56.200 --> 53:59.360
* 'Til we join the stick of angels
Kill the lengthy Amazon *

53:59.440 --> 54:02.800
- * Shout Geronimo, Geronimo *
- It's the Screaming Eagles
Airborne song.

54:02.880 --> 54:05.760
* It's a gory road to glory
But we're ready
Here we go *

54:05.880 --> 54:07.680
- * Shout Geronimo *
- Screaming assholes.

54:07.720 --> 54:10.680
- * Geronimo, look out below *
- Fuckin' A.

54:10.760 --> 54:14.000
- * Look out below **
- * Let me be free *

54:14.040 --> 54:17.280
-* Let me be free *
-I don't remember the rest of the words.

54:17.320 --> 54:19.200
* So let me be free *

54:19.240 --> 54:23.800
- * You'll always be happy with me **
- Chickenshit, get scared.

54:38.240 --> 54:40.080
Oh, boy.

54:40.160 --> 54:42.000
Fuckin' cold.

54:44.440 --> 54:46.760
Thirty-six beers.

54:46.800 --> 54:49.960
- Whoo ! What ?
- Come on.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.960
All right,
I'll go on, already.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.880
Wait, wait.

54:57.920 --> 55:02.680
You ever piss and take a drink of beer
at the same time ?

55:06.240 --> 55:08.120
Whoa.

55:10.400 --> 55:13.040
Ah, I just barely
got a chance to shake it off.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.960
Wait ! Come on !
Oh, fuck !

55:18.360 --> 55:20.200
Bastards !

55:21.600 --> 55:23.440
Sons of bitches !

55:57.680 --> 56:00.480
- You guys goin' my way ?
- Come on.

56:06.320 --> 56:08.160
Fuck !

56:11.360 --> 56:13.280
That's not funny !

56:31.960 --> 56:33.800
No fuckin' around now.

56:35.720 --> 56:38.600
Come on. Stick around.
Don't fuck around.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.960
All right ?
No fuckin' around.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.000
- Lemme out ! Lemme out !
- Out, out. Get out.

57:16.400 --> 57:18.280
This is not it.
Definitely.

57:18.320 --> 57:20.200
- They changed it.
- No kidding.

57:20.240 --> 57:22.080
Somehow they changed it.

57:22.160 --> 57:26.480
- Like this happens every goddamn year.
- You're full of shit, Stanley.

57:26.520 --> 57:29.160
- Who did you say was full of shit ?
- You're full of shit.

57:29.200 --> 57:32.640
- You're always full of shit.
- I'm starvin'.

57:32.720 --> 57:35.480
Eat that.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.800
Nick, how come
I never see you eatin' ?

57:37.840 --> 57:40.400
I like to starve myself.
Keeps the fear up.

57:40.480 --> 57:44.240
- It ain't natural. Come on, John.
- Hey ! That's mine.

57:44.320 --> 57:46.840
- You really want it that bad ?
- You're goddamn right.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.280
- Hey, give me a Twinkie, Mike.
- What are you guys,
a bunch of cripples ?

57:58.440 --> 58:01.160
- That's mustard !
- What ?

58:01.240 --> 58:04.880
He put mustard
on his Twink--

58:04.960 --> 58:07.400
You're talkin' like
a goddamn traffic cop.

58:07.480 --> 58:10.480
- Oh, fuck--
- Come on. Give me a beer, Mike.

58:10.560 --> 58:13.520
- Come on. Come on.
- I can't believe you guys.

58:13.600 --> 58:16.120
- What the hell am I doing with you ?
- This is not it.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.800
They changed it.
Somehow they changed it.

58:18.840 --> 58:22.840
- You couldn't find your
own ass with two hands.
- Fuckin' A.

58:22.920 --> 58:27.360
Hey, you know, we forgot
to toast Steven and Angela.

58:27.440 --> 58:29.400
Steven and Angela !

58:29.480 --> 58:31.320
Na zdorovije !

58:31.400 --> 58:33.880
Na zdorovije !

58:35.880 --> 58:39.640
- What ?

58:39.720 --> 58:43.000
Don't make me laugh
when I have things in my mouth.

58:43.080 --> 58:45.600
I can't take you guys anyplace.
What the hell you doin' ?

58:45.680 --> 58:47.880
Get your hands
off the fuckin' bread.

58:47.960 --> 58:50.200
You can dress 'em up,
but you can't take 'em anywhere.

58:50.320 --> 58:52.200
Oh, come on.
Come on !

58:52.240 --> 58:55.000
What the fuck you doin' ?
That was mine, you assholes.

58:59.920 --> 59:02.680
Fuckin' assholes.
I can't fuckin'--

59:02.720 --> 59:05.960
- Fuckin' A !
- What the fuck ?

59:06.040 --> 59:08.720
You know, Axel, you got
a terrific vocabulary.

59:08.800 --> 59:10.640
- Fuckin' A.
- Hey, watch the gear.

59:10.720 --> 59:14.200
Watch the rifle.
Axel, gimme my bag.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.640
It's gettin' cold, huh ?

59:19.960 --> 59:22.800
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks ?

59:29.200 --> 59:32.320
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks ?

59:33.480 --> 59:35.320
Never mind. I got 'em.

59:36.680 --> 59:38.560
Where the hell's my boots ?

59:41.440 --> 59:43.760
Anybody see my boots ?

59:43.840 --> 59:47.200
Somebody took my boots.
I bought 'em special.

59:48.760 --> 59:52.600
All right. All right, you guys.
Whoever took my boots, I want 'em back.

59:52.680 --> 59:56.120
I got a boot for you, Stan,
right up your ass.

59:56.240 --> 59:58.080
- Hey, Mike.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.080
Hey, Mike, lemme borrow
your spares, huh ?

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.960
- Your extra pair ?
- No, Stan.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.880
No ?

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.240
- What do you mean, "No" ?
- Just what I said. No. No means no.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.320
Some fuckin' friend.
You're some fuckin' friend,
you know that ?

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.280
Every time you come here,
you got your head up your ass.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.720
- Maybe he likes the view from up there.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.560
Every time he comes up,
he's got no knife, no jacket.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.880
He's got no pants, no boots.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.240
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries like John Wayne.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.160
That ain't gonna help ya.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.840
Oh, what the hell, Mike.
Give him the boots.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.640
No, I ain't givin' him no boots.
No more. That's it.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.520
You're a fuckin' bastard,
you know that ? Huh ?

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.520
Stanley, see this ?
This is this.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.600
This ain't somethin' else.
This is this.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.480
From now on, you're on your own.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.880
I fixed you up a million times.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.760
I fixed him up a million times.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.040
I don't know how many times
I must've fixed him up with girls.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.640
And nothin' ever happened. Zero.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.800
You know your trouble, Mike ?
Nobody ever knows
what you're talkin' about.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.640
"This is this." What the hell's
that supposed to mean ? "This is this."

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.520
Is that faggot-soundin' bullshit,
or is that faggot-soundin'--

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.440
Shut up, Stan, will ya ?
Hey, man, you're outta line.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.680
Watch out with that gun, Stan.
Watch out with the gun.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.480
Do you know what I think ? There's
times I swear I think you're a faggot.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.440
Hey, come on, you guys.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.400
Last week he could've had that new
redheaded waitress at the Bowladrome.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.680
He could've had it,
but look what he did.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.120
Nothin', that's what.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.160
Shut up, Stan.
Just shut up !

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.480
Just shut up. Take-- Take Michael's
goddamn boots and shut up.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.280
Otherwise, I'm goin' home.
I'm goin' home right now.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.520
- Get off my stuff.
What the hell're you doin' ?

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.720
Hey, Stosh.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.640
I said, "No."

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.040
What ? Are you gonna
shoot me ? Huh ?

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.120
Here.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.280
What's the matter with you ?

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.960
Stan.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.360
- Watch it, Mike ! Pow ! Whack !

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.120
Hey ! Hey, Angela !

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.640
Bums ! Go home !
Go home !

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.960
* Drop-kick me, Jesus *

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.240

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.040

* Drop-kick me, Jesus *

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.720
- * Through the goalposts of life **

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.360
- Un-fuckin'-believable.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.040
Oh, Christ.
I don't believe it.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.920
- Mike ?
- Mike !

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.520
Jesus Christ !
Hey !

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.840
- [ Man ] lncoming !

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.720
Steven, take it easy.
Stevie !

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.600
- Stevie, calm down !

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.560
Think of something else.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.560
Tell yourself to think
of something else.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.480
- We don't belong here.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:15.560
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:19.200
- I'm all right.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.720
I'm okay.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.360
Okay, just take it easy.
