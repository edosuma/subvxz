Once upon a time there was

11:26.286 --> 11:28.119
His mother had gone missing,
and his brother

11:28.121 --> 11:30.855
and father had gone into

This boy, it so happens,

in the woods.

you don't go in the woods.

[Aria] 'Cause the woods
was a bad place.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.709
[Wyatt] They was just scared of
what they didn't know.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.278
Now, this boy's friend,
he got frightened

11:53.280 --> 11:55.113
and he left that boy
in the woods all alone.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.415
What frightened him?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.385
[clattering and thudding]

really matter.

-Me.

Yes, you, there you were.

How'd I look?

12:18.772 --> 12:21.840
Like a rabbit, soft and scared.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.309
[Aria] Then what?

12:26.012 --> 12:28.480
We both lost our
mothers that night.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.251
I stood by you.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.122
At your side until sunrise.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.161
You're leaving out
all the sad parts.

your ass out the door.

you're going to go, huh?
Back to Uncle Johnny's house?

You want to wake up with
him in your bed again?

14:52.292 --> 14:53.992
I got other places to go.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.296
Yeah, like where?

You're still gonna be
sitting here in this filth,

turn the radio on

hear me and my voice

15:41.041 --> 15:44.108
and you're gonna think about
how much you could've loved me,

15:44.110 --> 15:48.279
but it'll be too late because
I will be long gone, baby.

name out of people's mouths?

your name's in people's mouths
for a whole new reason lately.

-Said they saw you
on the road back

that sounds romantic.
-Fuck you.

So, who is she?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.454
-No one.
-Well, she is someone,
that's a fact.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.424
I don't know why you're getting
so shy all of the sudden.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.160
From what I hear,
everyone's just...

18:17.230 --> 18:20.531
glad you're swinging
for the right team
after all these years.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.104
Well, I'm happy to relieve
you all, be seeing you, then.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.707
Wait, I'm just fucking with you.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.413
I'm happy for you,
buddy, I really am.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.283
So happy, in fact,
that next weekend, I got
a little surprise for you.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.519
I don't need anymore surprises.
I got enough to worry about.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.355

just a little get together,
if you will.

stomping grounds.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.328
-Why?
-Why not?

18:52.165 --> 18:54.465
We just don't get to see you
too often these days, Wyatt.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.401
Why don't you bring that
mystery friend of yours too?

18:57.403 --> 18:59.137
I know Ruby would
like to say hello.

excuse for the whole town

where they don't belong.

19:16.356 --> 19:21.159
Brothers and sisters...
this day is an opportunity

19:21.161 --> 19:24.529
to remember a pillar of our
community that held us together.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.432
On this anniversary of
the death of Nathalie West,

19:29.536 --> 19:33.237
we remember that the effect
of our choice is much like sin,

19:33.239 --> 19:35.606
rippled through the very
fabric of our fellowship.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.877
Nathalie wasn't like
most other people.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.181
She was so vibrant.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.552
She was a mother
to everyone she knew.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.626
<i>it happens to everything living.</i>

20:03.369 --> 20:04.869
[Abe] And like
many of us know...

20:06.573 --> 20:09.373
there were those we reluctantly
called our neighbors.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.781
Those who hid their sins deep
in the woods for generations.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.522
Nathalie, like many
before her, fell victim

20:24.524 --> 20:25.856
to the pull of those woods.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.863
[Aria]<i> The idea is intriguing...</i>

20:35.802 --> 20:37.368
<i> but as humans,</i>

20:37.971 --> 20:41.572

<i> accept the natural order.</i>

20:51.584 --> 20:53.351
But time is sometimes brutal.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.554
It causes us to lose those

20:56.556 --> 20:58.623
precious pieces of
our loved ones.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.625
Their voices become a wisp.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.795
The smell they left on their
favorite sweaters fades.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.266
But we can never lose
the mark they left,

21:08.735 --> 21:10.968
and that's the love
they left in our hearts.

heaven, brothers and sisters.

is our souls

22:01.754 --> 22:04.322
left stirring in the hearts
of those we leave behind.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.725
And it makes us dare
to ask the question,

22:07.727 --> 22:09.960
what will we leave behind
in those we love

22:09.962 --> 22:11.696
when the lord calls us home?

22:13.433 --> 22:15.599
Will we leave heaven in
the hearts of our people?

22:17.370 --> 22:18.502
Or hell?

22:22.575 --> 22:24.709
Perhaps we might all
leave a little bit of both.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.746
I want to thank you all
for joining us today,

22:28.748 --> 22:30.915

give our love and prayers

dedicated Sheriff, Jaxon West,

22:39.392 --> 22:41.525
And we delight in being
of service to you.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.598
Won't you please
join me in prayer?

22:49.869 --> 22:53.137
Heavenly dear father,
we thank you for--

23:05.551 --> 23:07.451
[car engine revving]

23:13.092 --> 23:14.859
Thank you, it's good to see you.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.795
Thank you, thanks.
Thanks for coming.

23:17.797 --> 23:21.065
Thanks, take care now.
Hey, hold, hold up there, Jaxon.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.401
Let me get a word in with you
before you head off.

23:24.837 --> 23:27.772
Hot one today, huh?
It's a good turn out though.

23:28.941 --> 23:31.909
If you only got the weather
to talk about, Abe,
I best be getting home.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.713
It was good to see Rule
in those pews again.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.681
It was good to see all
the West men there together.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.450
Yeah, it was downright lovely.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.787
Thank you again for your
kind words about my Nathalie.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.990
And best regards to
you and your family.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.958
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry,
Jaxon, but, um,

23:48.528 --> 23:50.194
if I could just get
a couple more words with you?

23:50.963 --> 23:52.563
All right, words, go.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.567
Look, I've,
I've known you for many years.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.936
Everyone in this
town has known me

23:58.938 --> 24:01.505
for many, many, many years, Abe.

24:01.507 --> 24:04.074
Yeah, but I'd like to think
I know you especially well.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.510
And well...

24:07.713 --> 24:08.913
I just want to check on you,

24:08.915 --> 24:10.581
on your well being and such.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.617
Asking me how I feel, Abe?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.920
Yeah, Jaxon, I suppose I am.

24:20.226 --> 24:24.528
I, uh... feel old... Abe.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.064
I feel older than my age.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.134
I feel tired 'cause
I do the work of seven men

24:30.136 --> 24:32.470
in all these bum-fuck
counties that surround us.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.772
I feel angry
'cause I'm underpaid.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.576
53-year-old man,
put my life at risk everyday.

24:38.578 --> 24:42.513
I feel like a failure
because my son is a junkie

24:42.515 --> 24:43.848
and he's shacked up with a whore

24:43.850 --> 24:46.484
in the dilapidated home
of my dead mother.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.118
And I feel depressed
because I haven't touched

24:48.120 --> 24:50.054
my wife's skin in ten years.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.057
And every morning I wake up,
I lose another piece of her.

24:54.727 --> 24:58.496
And sometimes I feel
like blowing my brains out

24:58.498 --> 25:00.631
all over my desk,
just pieces of me spilling

25:00.633 --> 25:03.033
in my morning coffee,
'cause maybe then...

25:05.204 --> 25:09.206
maybe then, I wake up from
this nightmare that is my life.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.844
That satisfy your curiosity?

25:14.914 --> 25:17.147
No, wait, Jaxon,
come on, I just--

25:20.586 --> 25:21.619
Okay.

25:28.694 --> 25:29.994
[door slams]

25:29.996 --> 25:32.162
[rock music]

25:32.164 --> 25:33.731
<i> ¶ Baby, come outside ¶</i>

25:36.836 --> 25:39.236
[Jolene] My mommy used to make
us fried baloney sandwiches

25:39.238 --> 25:40.971
after church every Sunday.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.541
They were my favorite.

25:43.543 --> 25:47.645
And then my daddy would spread
the paper all out on the floor

25:47.647 --> 25:49.780
so we could each pick
our favorite parts.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.551
Mine was always the funnies.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.655
They were so colorful
and everything else was gray.

26:02.628 --> 26:03.994
Do you believe what he said?

26:05.831 --> 26:09.066
The preacher...
about our souls living out

26:09.068 --> 26:10.834
in what we left in people?

26:11.137 --> 26:12.303
Do you think that's right?

26:14.273 --> 26:15.272
No.

26:17.643 --> 26:20.210
Well, if it is, I hope my
mommy and daddy's souls

26:20.212 --> 26:22.313
get fried baloney sandwiches

26:22.315 --> 26:24.915
and the most colorful
funnies today.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.053
Jolene, your mama was a whore.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.156
Your daddy died
in Eddyville State Pen.

26:34.994 --> 26:37.261
You're the meanest
man I ever met.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.029
Yeah, you never met my daddy.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.933
You know, you always talk
about how fucked up I am.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.235
But what about you?

26:45.838 --> 26:47.638
So, your mommy died
and your daddy

26:47.640 --> 26:51.008
thinks you're a piece
of shit, that's it?

26:52.211 --> 26:53.777
Who cares?

26:53.779 --> 26:55.813
Just stop fucking talking,
all right?

26:56.315 --> 26:59.016
All you do everyday is
try to quiet demons

26:59.018 --> 27:01.885
-and I want to know
why, you tell me.
-Fuck, Jolene, fuck!

27:02.955 --> 27:04.622
Just get the fuck out, Jolene!

27:06.092 --> 27:07.391
Just get the fuck out.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.293
Go, go!

27:10.830 --> 27:12.162
Go, I ain't playing around.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.367
You're an asshole.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.050
[Rule] Jo.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.119
Jolene.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.389
Jo Jo, come on, baby,
get back in the car.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.158
Jo Jo, come on.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.693
Get back in the car, honey.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.765
Come on.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.434
Come on, it's just words,
I didn't mean nothing by it.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.368
Come on.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.681
I didn't mean nothing.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.818
[whispers] You're mean.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.354
You're a mean person, Rule.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.158
I may be mean,
but I'm all you got, girl.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.474
[car approaching]

28:35.815 --> 28:37.014
[car door closes]

28:59.872 --> 29:01.305
You've been gone a long time.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.143
I know.

29:07.747 --> 29:08.879
I'm sorry.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.872
My family is going
through some things.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.310
Must be nice.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.314
It's not.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.986
Must be nice to have
people though.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.424
I'm not always sure.

29:56.896 --> 29:57.828
I have no one.

30:02.868 --> 30:03.867
You have me.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.071
You're not my people.

30:13.879 --> 30:15.345
Blood isn't everything.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.081
I am your people.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.517
Only sometimes.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.956
[somber music]

30:37.002 --> 30:38.468
[Millie] What are we gonna do?

30:40.239 --> 30:41.405
What do you mean?

30:42.441 --> 30:44.074
They're gonna come for her.

30:47.580 --> 30:48.612
I know.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.092
You okay?

31:02.094 --> 31:06.296
[Millie] Are you thinking
they're just going
to come in peace?

31:08.634 --> 31:11.235
I'm thinking there's
a pretty good understanding
how things go out here.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.436
I hate this.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.273
Just because you watched
somebody die

31:16.275 --> 31:17.941
doesn't make you broken, Mill.

31:19.445 --> 31:20.911
We've watched people die.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.882
Are we broken?

31:30.322 --> 31:32.089
I remembered today.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.503
What did you remember?

31:52.611 --> 31:54.444
Some sad parts.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.081
We knew that there were
gonna be sacrifices

31:58.083 --> 31:59.683
to live the way
that we wanted to live.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.486
We're not bad people, Mill!

32:03.155 --> 32:04.521
We're not bad people!

32:04.523 --> 32:07.257
Those are bad people,
we're not bad!

32:33.519 --> 32:35.085
[Aria] This is it.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.189
This is the night.

-[Aria] They came.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.633
Before you found me,

before my family went away,

32:53.405 --> 32:54.972
they're in these photos.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.441
Why didn't you tell me?

32:59.478 --> 33:02.079
[crying] I didn't
want to remember.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.649
You want me to...

You all remember last
time we were here?

34:56.462 --> 34:58.862
You fucking remember.
He got his fucking dick out.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.665
Staring right--
He's staring, he's looking
in his own eyeballs.

-[Rule] Jo, you are
so fucking high.
-[laughs]

35:08.574 --> 35:12.109
I'm not, [laughs]
I'm feeling great.

35:25.390 --> 35:26.890
[Arlo] Oh, oh, look who's there.

35:27.693 --> 35:31.194
I mean, he's a little
bit late but... he's here.

-[grunting]
-[Arlo] How are you, bud?

35:33.365 --> 35:34.698
How's it going?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.767
Oh. Now, who do we have here?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.537
-Hmm?
-This is Aria.

35:41.206 --> 35:45.342
Well, Aria, it my sincere
pleasure to meet you.

-This is Ruby.
-Hi.

Looks like, uh, the old stomping
grounds are pretty popular.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.929
Yeah, yeah, I mean, uh, yeah.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.265
Even your brother made
it out the hollow for this one.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.836
Oh, great.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.605
Brother?

36:15.607 --> 36:17.474
Oh, you all haven't met?

36:18.443 --> 36:20.844
Well, why don't you
come on over?

36:21.513 --> 36:23.246
[laughs] We'll introduce.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.449
[Arlo] Wyatt, come on.

36:42.935 --> 36:44.634
[Rule] I lined this fucker up.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.688
Get up.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.456
Get up!

37:08.894 --> 37:09.960
Bye you all.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.607
Aria. Aria!

[eerie music]

37:58.343 --> 38:00.610
Your girlfriend's into
some weird shit, man.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.313
What the fuck you doing here?

38:03.882 --> 38:06.783
Your place is so pretty.

38:08.553 --> 38:11.488
-Get out!
-Hey, easy, brother.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.293
You're trespassing.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.461
Now leave.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.031
You kidding me? [chuckles]

38:21.566 --> 38:23.633
You come over to
my house anytime you want.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.802
Got shit to say about
every way I live.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.805
You start paying for my way,

38:28.807 --> 38:31.675
-you can say all you want.
-[chuckles softly]

38:31.677 --> 38:35.545
-Fuck you, I don't
need your charity.
-Rule.

38:35.547 --> 38:38.315
You can take your money and
stick your nose up Daddy's ass

38:38.317 --> 38:40.083
until you fucking can't feel
it anymore you hear me, brother?

38:40.085 --> 38:42.519
-Rule, Rule.
-What?

38:48.627 --> 38:50.026
What the fuck's she doing?

38:50.028 --> 38:51.094
[Wyatt] Aria.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.797
They're, they're leaving.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.435
Yeah, maybe we won't.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.937
Maybe we'll just stick
around for a little while.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.943
Rule... now.

39:10.949 --> 39:13.116
[eerie music]

39:29.634 --> 39:30.867
I know who you are.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.443
Can I go now please?

39:51.590 --> 39:52.789
It's okay.

39:53.992 --> 39:54.991
You too.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.462
-What?
-[Aria] Get out.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.666
-Aria, I don't--
-[gun cocks]

41:00.892 --> 41:02.225
[screaming]

41:23.715 --> 41:25.582
Last night was really scary.

41:32.691 --> 41:34.090
Baby, I got an idea for us.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.627
Will you sit down?

41:39.931 --> 41:41.097
Please?

41:54.546 --> 41:57.580
Now, I want you to hear me
out completely.

42:01.953 --> 42:04.087
There's a place I think
we should go to.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.125
You're not sober enough to drive
your ass out of this mountain.

42:10.929 --> 42:13.062
But that's
the whole thing, Rule.

42:14.266 --> 42:15.932
What if we tried clean?

42:18.637 --> 42:20.236
I'm being for real,
I want to go.

42:21.806 --> 42:22.739
Why?

42:24.643 --> 42:25.575
To get sober.

42:25.577 --> 42:26.576
Sober for what?

42:28.146 --> 42:29.946
I've been trying my whole life.

42:32.651 --> 42:35.585
Don't you feel that,
the weight of this place?

42:38.056 --> 42:42.125
You know, baby, after so long
we, we got to ask ourselves,

42:42.127 --> 42:44.327
is it, is it this place
or in our own selves

42:44.329 --> 42:45.895
that's keeping us here?

42:46.298 --> 42:47.830
What's wrong with here?

42:49.601 --> 42:51.234
You think you deserve
better than here?

42:52.203 --> 42:54.671
No, I don't,
I don't deserve better,

42:55.907 --> 42:58.141
'cause I ain't never done
anything to deserve it.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.877
Maybe it ain't too
late to start.

43:02.681 --> 43:03.980
Are you unhappy with me?

43:05.116 --> 43:06.049
No, baby.

43:07.218 --> 43:08.585
I give you everything,

43:08.587 --> 43:10.153
you live in my house,
you eat my food.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.322
Why's that not enough for you?

43:12.324 --> 43:15.892
-This is our house, Rule--
-Oh, fuck you, our house.

43:17.963 --> 43:19.862
Your brother keeps
these lights on.

43:37.148 --> 43:38.314
Happy with yourself?

43:41.119 --> 43:43.720
Breaking up your happy
home with your two boys.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.624
Are you fucking him?

43:47.626 --> 43:48.758
I am!

43:49.628 --> 43:51.127
Get out of my house!

43:51.830 --> 43:53.396
Get out! Treating me like--

43:54.165 --> 43:55.331
Get out!

44:02.707 --> 44:04.173
[Rule] I'll help you find her.

[Nathalie panting]

44:20.358 --> 44:21.991
Look at us.

44:25.296 --> 44:28.831
I just want us to be a little
bit better, just normal.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.099
It's never going to happen.

44:33.872 --> 44:35.972
You feel normal going into
that church on Sunday?

44:37.075 --> 44:38.074
Huh?

44:38.910 --> 44:40.109
Is that what you want?

44:41.246 --> 44:42.845
You wanna be like those people?

44:43.848 --> 44:45.715
People who just
pretend everything's good,

44:45.717 --> 44:46.749
day in and day out?

44:46.751 --> 44:50.853
Meanwhile the inside's
just festering.
Is that what you want?

44:50.855 --> 44:52.288
That's pretend, Jolene.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.858
Everything about you is pretend.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.728
Everything good in your life
is fucking make believe.

45:00.432 --> 45:02.398
I don't want to pretend
good anymore.

45:04.436 --> 45:06.369
I want it here,
right in front of me.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.074
I want to be it,
I want to make it.

45:12.243 --> 45:14.177
Who the fuck do you think
you are, Jolene?

45:15.413 --> 45:19.382
You ain't got
no choice, you were born here.
Think you just skip town?

45:19.384 --> 45:22.151
Waltz out of here, huh?
Like this town ain't
got you by the nuts?

45:22.754 --> 45:25.388
Like it did my daddy
and your daddy and their daddies
before them, huh?

45:26.958 --> 45:28.391
You ain't got a choice, Jolene.

45:28.927 --> 45:32.161
You're a piece of shit
and I'm a piece of shit.

45:34.099 --> 45:35.865
Nobody cares about you.

45:37.502 --> 45:38.901
You got that?

47:25.944 --> 47:27.176
What happened last night?

47:28.580 --> 47:30.947
-I don't know.
-Mm-mm.

47:32.617 --> 47:35.885
Someone... say something to her?

47:37.522 --> 47:39.889
She was behind me
the whole time, I'm not sure.

47:41.059 --> 47:45.094
-And then Rule followed
me back to her place.
-Oh, shit.

47:45.096 --> 47:46.863
Yeah, wasn't good.

47:48.233 --> 47:50.233
She hasn't spoken to me since.

never left the house. [laughs]

48:04.282 --> 48:07.450
Just 'cause you ain't put eyes
on her doesn't mean she hasn't
left the house.

48:09.621 --> 48:11.020
Where did you find her?

48:18.496 --> 48:21.931
All right, Wyatt, what is it
you're not telling me?

48:24.936 --> 48:26.202
I met her in the woods.

48:30.408 --> 48:31.941
What do you mean in the woods?

-You said--
-I said a lot of things, I lied.

49:19.090 --> 49:21.123
I was a kid, I lost my mother.

You've known her
all these years?

49:30.234 --> 49:32.601
-She saved me.
-Saved you from what?

49:33.371 --> 49:34.403
The trap.

49:34.405 --> 49:37.506
-The trap that she set.
-No, no, she didn't.

to do this anymore.

a fuck anymore,

experienced anything real.

experience one ounce

it just
all explodes in your face.

And all that shitty shit shits
just staring right at you.

that you could just...

1:00:52.182 --> 1:00:54.850
Yeah, sometimes the truth's
better left alone, son.

1:01:07.064 --> 1:01:09.931
[Abe] Lord, we ask
that you would meet us
in this time and place

1:01:09.933 --> 1:01:12.234
and bless us with your
unconditional love.

1:01:13.737 --> 1:01:15.170
And we thank you
for that tiny baby

1:01:15.172 --> 1:01:16.738
growing in our sweet Ruby,

1:01:16.740 --> 1:01:20.175

she will bring into our lives.

-Amen.
-Amen.

1:01:25.849 --> 1:01:28.250
Oh, thank you for
this delicious meal.

1:01:29.219 --> 1:01:31.119
And you are going to
make a wonderful mother

1:01:32.289 --> 1:01:33.822
and a wife some day.

1:01:35.859 --> 1:01:36.792
Thank you.

1:01:40.130 --> 1:01:41.697
So, Arlo, what did you do today?

1:01:42.232 --> 1:01:44.366
You know, Dad, I met with Wyatt.

1:01:44.368 --> 1:01:45.967
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1:01:46.437 --> 1:01:50.939
We had a bunch of stuff
we, uh... needed to catch up on.

1:01:50.941 --> 1:01:54.142
Let's just say, um...
he's doing good.

1:01:54.144 --> 1:01:55.444
I hadn't seen him
too much recently

1:01:55.446 --> 1:01:57.245
until the bonfire
the other night.

1:01:57.247 --> 1:01:58.346
Tell him.

1:01:59.817 --> 1:02:01.283
Your father
has the right to know.

1:02:02.486 --> 1:02:06.121
What do, what do I have
the right to know about?

1:02:07.391 --> 1:02:08.890
Nothing, Dad.

1:02:08.892 --> 1:02:12.294
Well, let's just say that we
need to lift Wyatt up in prayer.

1:02:13.130 --> 1:02:14.129
[Abe] I always do.

1:02:16.366 --> 1:02:17.399
So...

1:02:17.401 --> 1:02:21.236
there something specific
we should be lifting up?

1:02:27.177 --> 1:02:31.046
Well, he's been sleeping
with an unsavory character.

1:02:32.182 --> 1:02:33.882
And what character is that?

1:02:37.888 --> 1:02:39.087
She's a Dumont.

1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:44.526
We don't know that.

1:02:45.095 --> 1:02:47.462
[Ruby] Arlo, he told
you with his own mouth.

1:02:48.999 --> 1:02:50.031
Well...

1:02:52.202 --> 1:02:53.535
that is certainly something

1:02:53.537 --> 1:02:56.404
we should be, um,
lifting up in prayer.

1:02:56.406 --> 1:02:57.405
[Ruby] Mm-hmm.

1:02:57.407 --> 1:03:00.876
Thank you for bringing
that to my attention, Ruby.

you ever notice
how much alike we are?

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:12.754
I mean, just like you,
the people in this town
are my business.

1:08:14.091 --> 1:08:16.724
You try to protect their
bodies, I, their souls.

1:08:17.727 --> 1:08:20.728
And in order to do that,
I need to know what's
happening in their lives.

problems too if I were you.

Look, I'm, I'm not
here to fight with you.

1:08:52.696 --> 1:08:56.397
Then, may I ask you kindly
what the fuck you're here for?

1:08:57.534 --> 1:08:58.466
The truth.

1:08:59.636 --> 1:09:01.302

of me and my boys,
we ain't ever met.

1:09:20.457 --> 1:09:23.825
Yeah, maybe if you took your
head out of what happened in
your family ten years ago,

1:09:23.827 --> 1:09:26.227
you'd know what's happening
to them right now, brother.

1:09:26.630 --> 1:09:27.929
I am not your brother.

1:09:29.266 --> 1:09:32.167
Look, reach out and connect
with your family.

1:09:33.236 --> 1:09:34.636
Know where they are.

1:09:35.705 --> 1:09:37.906
Find out what they love
and what they're scared of,

1:09:38.675 --> 1:09:41.743
and tell them all the things
that make you drink every
hour of the day.

1:09:45.882 --> 1:09:48.249
You best go. Now.

1:09:50.921 --> 1:09:52.921
We all know about Rule.

1:09:54.858 --> 1:09:56.824

your favorite boy does?

1:09:56.826 --> 1:09:59.260
Do you know who he spends
his days with?

1:10:01.531 --> 1:10:02.463
You should find out.

1:10:04.501 --> 1:10:06.968
Look, you're still responsible
for this, for them,

1:10:08.238 --> 1:10:09.704
even when you feel pain.

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:13.374
You need to figure out
where all that comes from.

1:10:13.376 --> 1:10:15.777
Hmm. Yeah, I got
a pretty good idea.

covet thy neighbor's wife?

1:10:44.841 --> 1:10:46.441
How's that working out for you?

1:10:48.778 --> 1:10:51.946
Nathalie wasn't the only one
who died out there
that night, was she?

1:10:55.819 --> 1:10:58.853
Come on, you can tell me.

1:11:02.025 --> 1:11:04.459
I did what I had to do
to protect my son

1:11:04.461 --> 1:11:06.961
from rotting away in prison
for the rest of his life.

1:11:07.497 --> 1:11:09.931
And now he's rotting away
in a hollow,

1:11:09.933 --> 1:11:12.934
in a prison of his own
addiction because
you can't forgive.

1:11:17.007 --> 1:11:18.906
-You want the truth?
-Yes.

1:11:21.611 --> 1:11:24.379
I will never forgive anything
that happened that night.

1:11:34.958 --> 1:11:38.493
Go talk to your sons,
do it soon.

1:12:16.433 --> 1:12:17.598

1:13:15.124 --> 1:13:16.557
I should've told you but
I couldn't, I didn't want to.

1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:19.160
I did something so wrong.

1:13:21.698 --> 1:13:23.664
Something really
truly awful, baby,

1:13:23.666 --> 1:13:25.800
and if I told you,
I thought you'd hate me.

1:13:29.172 --> 1:13:31.105
I should've told you, baby.

Where's that tramp you've
been knocking around with?

1:15:16.145 --> 1:15:17.645
I don't know.

1:15:17.647 --> 1:15:18.913
Where is she, Rule?

1:15:25.054 --> 1:15:25.987
Gone.

1:15:27.190 --> 1:15:28.189
Good.

1:15:29.025 --> 1:15:30.258
What about your brother?

1:15:32.228 --> 1:15:33.160
Huh?

1:15:34.898 --> 1:15:36.864
You been hanging
with your brother lately.

1:15:38.735 --> 1:15:40.568
I haven't been
hanging out with nobody.

1:15:41.638 --> 1:15:42.837
Well, you're full of shit.

1:15:42.839 --> 1:15:46.807
You know something,
and you tell me what you know.

1:15:48.912 --> 1:15:52.313
-[thudding]
-You spit your goddamn
words out, boy,

1:15:52.315 --> 1:15:54.248
or I will skin your hide.

All, all I know is Wyatt,
Wyatt's been with a girl.

1:16:09.566 --> 1:16:10.298
What girl?

1:16:12.835 --> 1:16:14.035
A girl from the woods.

1:16:16.706 --> 1:16:18.806
So, you tell me
why that means fuck all.

1:16:21.144 --> 1:16:22.643
I seen where she lives.

1:16:23.613 --> 1:16:24.345
So what?

1:16:28.017 --> 1:16:29.584
It's the ten acres of hell.

1:16:31.154 --> 1:16:32.286
[chuckles softly]

1:16:35.658 --> 1:16:36.891
She the Dumont girl?

1:16:40.897 --> 1:16:42.196
[Rule] Wyatt don't know.

1:16:46.235 --> 1:16:47.768
We better find him.

1:16:48.271 --> 1:16:49.837
I ain't going fucking nowhere.

1:16:51.341 --> 1:16:52.907
We've done enough to that girl.

1:16:55.278 --> 1:16:57.044
We've done enough to that girl.

1:17:01.818 --> 1:17:02.600
Hmm.

1:17:02.601 --> 1:17:03.383
The drugs have fucked
your mind, boy.

1:17:04.087 --> 1:17:05.720
She murdered your mother.

1:17:08.057 --> 1:17:08.990
No.

1:17:09.926 --> 1:17:10.958
Nobody killed Mama.

1:17:12.962 --> 1:17:16.297
Whose traps were they, huh?
Who built them, huh?

1:17:16.299 --> 1:17:19.166
Her blood, her family, and
none of this would've happened

1:17:19.168 --> 1:17:21.202
if you hadn't of fucked up
and pulled that trigger.

1:17:21.204 --> 1:17:22.303
I was just a boy.

1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:25.640
But you knew what
you were doing.

1:17:26.042 --> 1:17:27.742
And you knew what I'd do.

1:17:33.883 --> 1:17:35.783
She was a beautiful woman.

1:17:37.020 --> 1:17:38.986
You must've loved her very much.

1:17:40.923 --> 1:17:43.691
[Rule] I did. You killed her.

1:17:46.763 --> 1:17:50.297
No, baby, it was an accident.

1:17:50.299 --> 1:17:53.868
[guns firing]

1:17:54.904 --> 1:17:58.139
Well, we all got to
be held accountable
for the stupid shit that we do.

1:17:59.375 --> 1:18:00.975
You hate me, don't you?

1:18:02.879 --> 1:18:04.111
Yeah, I do.

1:18:05.815 --> 1:18:07.448
[whimpers] I hate me too, Dad.

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:12.286
[crying] We killed them all.

1:18:13.056 --> 1:18:15.222

[Jaxon] Come on.

1:19:04.207 --> 1:19:05.840
We're going to go finish this.

1:19:06.242 --> 1:19:07.208
I can't.

1:19:10.313 --> 1:19:12.313
I ain't got no hate
left in me, Daddy.

1:19:14.250 --> 1:19:15.816
I got nothing left for her.

1:19:30.199 --> 1:19:31.298
Fucking useless.

1:19:56.793 --> 1:19:57.525
Get up.

1:19:59.962 --> 1:20:01.495
Get the fuck up.

1:20:02.365 --> 1:20:07.501
You go, you leave.
You have to get lost.

1:20:08.471 --> 1:20:09.804
You pack nothing.

1:20:09.806 --> 1:20:11.405
You don't talk to anybody.

1:20:11.407 --> 1:20:13.440
You don't look at anybody.

1:20:13.442 --> 1:20:16.177
You don't stop,
you don't look back

1:20:16.179 --> 1:20:19.213
until the soles of your
feet are blood and bones.

1:20:19.215 --> 1:20:22.349
I hate you because
you're more like me

1:20:22.351 --> 1:20:25.219
than anything else
on this Earth.

Some of those are gonna hurt.

1:21:36.192 --> 1:21:37.992
I don't need them anymore.

1:21:39.228 --> 1:21:40.527
I remember now.

1:21:52.541 --> 1:21:55.009

[Nathalie crying]

1:22:44.660 --> 1:22:46.427
What if I can't forget?

1:22:51.701 --> 1:22:54.168
That was a long time ago,
it's over now.

1:23:53.596 --> 1:23:54.661
[Wyatt] Dad.

1:23:57.400 --> 1:24:00.067
You don't even know what you're
doing with this girl, son.

1:24:01.470 --> 1:24:02.469
Yeah, I do.

1:24:04.373 --> 1:24:05.305
No, you don't.

1:24:06.642 --> 1:24:08.375
I refuse to believe that you do.

1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:12.246
[Wyatt] Put the guns down.

1:24:14.316 --> 1:24:15.449
Put them down.

1:24:15.785 --> 1:24:17.251
She's done nothing wrong.

1:24:17.653 --> 1:24:19.219
That's where you're wrong, son.

1:24:19.221 --> 1:24:22.823
This girl's to be
held accountable
for the death of your mother.

1:24:25.294 --> 1:24:26.560
Mama's death was an accident.

1:24:27.163 --> 1:24:28.262
What do you know?

1:24:29.065 --> 1:24:30.564
You never saw what they did.

1:24:32.101 --> 1:24:33.300
[Jaxon] You weren't there.

1:24:33.636 --> 1:24:34.835
I wanted to be there.

1:24:35.838 --> 1:24:38.272
There are no accidents
out here, Wyatt.

1:24:39.075 --> 1:24:42.342
Generation after generation
dying in traps on this land

1:24:42.344 --> 1:24:44.545
because these bootlegging
wastes of skin

1:24:44.547 --> 1:24:46.814
want to protect themselves
and live above the law?

1:24:48.250 --> 1:24:49.817
Your mother was murdered
plain and simple.

1:24:49.819 --> 1:24:53.554
And I love you, Wyatt,
I love your mommy more.

1:24:56.692 --> 1:24:58.158
What are you gonna do?

1:24:59.261 --> 1:25:00.427
You gonna kill us both?

1:25:03.532 --> 1:25:04.865
Why don't I let you choose?

1:25:06.602 --> 1:25:08.102
Her or me?

1:25:08.571 --> 1:25:09.670
[Aria] Enough.

1:25:17.113 --> 1:25:18.412
What do you need to know?

1:25:19.415 --> 1:25:20.747
[melancholic piano music]

1:25:20.749 --> 1:25:22.149
What do I need to know?

1:25:23.819 --> 1:25:25.652
-I want to know everything.
-Dad, don't.

1:25:30.860 --> 1:25:32.860
[Aria] I remember the first
time I saw her.

1:25:37.166 --> 1:25:38.599
I wanted to save her.

1:25:42.471 --> 1:25:44.371
I still dream
about it every night.

1:25:50.379 --> 1:25:51.745
She said something...

1:25:54.850 --> 1:25:55.916
before she went.

1:26:03.859 --> 1:26:05.659
-It's okay.
-[Aria crying]

1:26:06.729 --> 1:26:07.928
You can tell me.

1:26:11.567 --> 1:26:12.799
She said...

1:26:14.937 --> 1:26:16.403
"I forgive you."

1:26:34.557 --> 1:26:35.789
What did she say?

1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:38.859
[whispers] "I forgive you."

1:26:40.930 --> 1:26:43.597
-For my drinking.
-[Aria] "I forgive you."

1:26:45.568 --> 1:26:48.235
-For throwing you
out of the house.
-[Aria] "I forgive you."

1:26:48.704 --> 1:26:50.204
For letting you go in the woods.

1:26:50.573 --> 1:26:51.738
"I forgive you."

1:26:51.740 --> 1:26:54.741
-For not calling you back.
-[Aria] "I forgive you."

1:26:54.743 --> 1:26:57.678
-For not telling you I love you.
-"I forgive you." [crying]

1:27:04.286 --> 1:27:05.986
[Jaxon grunting]

1:27:14.697 --> 1:27:16.263
[grunting]

1:27:18.801 --> 1:27:20.534
All right, what's done is done.

1:27:22.304 --> 1:27:23.337
It's over.

1:27:25.007 --> 1:27:26.440
Sheriff?

1:27:30.713 --> 1:27:31.812
I'm sorry.

1:27:45.561 --> 1:27:46.994
[gun firing]

1:27:46.996 --> 1:27:48.629
[light dramatic music]

1:27:48.631 --> 1:27:49.596
[Wyatt] No!

1:27:50.799 --> 1:27:53.400
No. No.

1:27:54.503 --> 1:27:56.036
What did you do?

1:27:59.975 --> 1:28:01.541
What did you do?

1:28:03.012 --> 1:28:04.678
A fox ain't a chicken.

1:28:09.952 --> 1:28:12.352
[somber piano music]

1:28:22.064 --> 1:28:24.965
[police sirens blaring]

1:28:28.570 --> 1:28:30.504
[officer over speaker]
<i> Stop. Get your hands up.</i>

1:28:30.973 --> 1:28:32.039
<i> Turn around.</i>

1:28:32.675 --> 1:28:33.874
<i> Get down on your knees.</i>

1:28:35.611 --> 1:28:37.844
<i> Let me see your hands,</i>
<i> put them up.</i>

1:28:40.349 --> 1:28:41.381
<i> Turn around.</i>

1:28:45.020 --> 1:28:46.420
<i> Get on your knees.</i>

1:28:51.593 --> 1:28:53.460
[somber violin music]

1:28:53.462 --> 1:28:54.561
I'm sorry.

1:28:55.698 --> 1:28:57.931
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:30:20.149 --> 1:30:21.948
