of Pakled Planet.

What we know at this hour:
Starfleet Captain Carol Freeman

00:26.947 --> 00:30.038

a devastating attack

00:30.081 --> 00:31.430

00:31.474 --> 00:34.738

"Big Strong City."

stands trial.

-No comment.

-What did you hear?
-I said no comment.

00:47.359 --> 00:48.665
-Please, a little respect.
-Did she hate Pakleds?

in the courtroom know it, too.

that's now putting her on trial?

the Golden Gate Bridge.

Why do you need a bridge?

This planet's wack.

17:40.284 --> 17:41.764
we're gonna be right beside you.

17:41.807 --> 17:43.592
Yeah, we're in this together.

17:43.635 --> 17:44.897
SECURITY OFFICER [over comms]:
USSCerritos,

17:44.941 --> 17:46.638
this is an unauthorized launch.

17:46.682 --> 17:48.423
What is the nature
of your emergency?

17:48.466 --> 17:50.468
Oh, crap, it's security.
What do we say? What do we say?

17:50.512 --> 17:51.774
This is all my fault, okay?

17:51.817 --> 17:53.167
I'll-I'll say
I took you hostage and...

17:53.210 --> 17:54.342
[gasp] Wait, look.

17:54.385 --> 17:55.995
It's the verugament.

17:58.128 --> 18:01.131
RUTHERFORD: Oh, man, I
stopped us right in their path.

18:01.175 --> 18:03.307
They're incandescent
extremophiles.

18:03.351 --> 18:05.135
They migrate through space
and feed on microscopic...

18:05.179 --> 18:07.050
[screams]
They're attacking the ship.

18:07.094 --> 18:08.704
No, look at this sensor.

18:08.747 --> 18:10.271
I-I think they're synthesizing
carbon off the hull,

18:10.314 --> 18:11.707
and it's triggering
a mass reproductive event.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.796
MARINER:
It's an orgy?

18:13.839 --> 18:16.059
Aw, I guess they were in search
of a breeding ground,

18:16.103 --> 18:18.757
and we're it.
[gasps] So magical.

18:18.801 --> 18:20.194
SECURITY OFFICER:
Cerritos, I repeat,

18:20.237 --> 18:22.761
this is an unauthorized launch.
Please respond.

18:22.805 --> 18:24.415
[gasps] Quick, open a channel.

18:24.459 --> 18:26.417
-What? What're you gonna say?
-TENDI: Just do it!

18:26.461 --> 18:28.376
This is Ensign D'Vana Tendi

18:28.419 --> 18:30.508
of the Cerritos.We are
performing a biological survey

18:30.552 --> 18:32.728
of these reproducing organisms.

18:32.771 --> 18:34.686
Uh, we're only reading
four of you.

18:34.730 --> 18:36.384
That's right.
Everyone else is grounded.

18:36.427 --> 18:39.213
This is a rare scientific event.
We must not be interrupted.

18:39.256 --> 18:40.692
Interrupted? [stammers]
We're coming aboard,

18:40.736 --> 18:41.780
just stay where you are.

18:41.824 --> 18:43.260
Okay, uh,

18:43.304 --> 18:45.610
open the bay doors
and follow me. Come on!

18:49.353 --> 18:52.226
What the hell
is going on in here?

18:52.269 --> 18:55.490
Uh, these endangered
creatures need help

18:55.533 --> 18:57.231
transferring their gametes.

18:57.274 --> 18:59.494
We're facilitating while we...
[screams] ...study them.

18:59.537 --> 19:02.323
Uh, doesn't it hurt? Seems like
a lot of charged tentacles.

19:02.366 --> 19:04.325
Ow. Yeah, no, yeah, it hurts.

19:04.368 --> 19:07.197
But there's no substitute
for first... [dry heaves]

19:07.241 --> 19:08.503
...firsthand data.

19:08.546 --> 19:11.332
This is-- Ow!--
just a marvelous-- Ow!--

19:11.375 --> 19:12.985
specimen. Ouch!

19:13.029 --> 19:15.074
Okay, I think I've seen
just about enough here.

19:15.118 --> 19:16.554
Are we under arrest?

19:16.598 --> 19:19.122
For what? Helping
these precious creatures?

19:19.166 --> 19:20.210
Of course not.

19:20.254 --> 19:21.429
And let me just say,

19:21.472 --> 19:23.300
I love seeing junior officers

19:23.344 --> 19:24.823
committed to the pursuit
of science.

19:24.867 --> 19:26.434
Yeah, man. [chuckles]

19:26.477 --> 19:28.262
That is us,
just pursuing and doing.

19:28.305 --> 19:30.133
Super. We'll just need to know
the commander

19:30.177 --> 19:32.179
who ordered this mission,
and we'll be on our way.

19:32.222 --> 19:34.006
Uh...

19:34.050 --> 19:35.486
[chuckles] It's not like
you just stole a starship

19:35.530 --> 19:37.619
all on your own.
That'd be bananas.

19:37.662 --> 19:39.360
So, come on, who ordered this?

19:39.403 --> 19:40.578
Uh...

19:40.622 --> 19:43.755
I did. Captain Carol Freeman.

19:43.799 --> 19:45.714
-Mom?
-Thanks, Captain Freeman.

19:45.757 --> 19:48.325
Glad to have you back.

19:48.369 --> 19:49.848
We're clear.

19:49.892 --> 19:51.589
What the...

19:51.633 --> 19:53.200
What are you doing here?
What happened with the trial?

19:53.243 --> 19:54.201
Are you on the run?

19:54.244 --> 19:55.985
The trial's over, Beckett.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.508
It is? How?

19:57.552 --> 19:59.336
While I was sitting in court,

19:59.380 --> 20:02.034
Starfleet was carrying out
a secret investigation

20:02.078 --> 20:03.558
into the Pakled bombing.

20:03.601 --> 20:05.734
Led by Captain Morgan Bateson,

20:05.777 --> 20:08.127
this elite team learned
of a Pakled connection

20:08.171 --> 20:09.912
to a known data fabricator,

20:09.955 --> 20:11.914
whom they discovered had faked

20:11.957 --> 20:14.046
the incriminating footage of me.

20:14.090 --> 20:16.571
They pursued
and captured this forger

20:16.614 --> 20:18.573
inside the Romulan Neutral Zone.

20:18.616 --> 20:21.489
Under some rather
invasive questioning

20:21.532 --> 20:24.274
from Commander Tuvok,
this forger revealed

20:24.318 --> 20:26.494
the true identity
of the bombers,

20:26.537 --> 20:28.626
the Pakleds themselves.

20:28.670 --> 20:31.020
-OTHERS: What?
-FREEMAN: It was a huge reveal.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.241
Turns out that their plan
was to blow up their own capital

20:34.284 --> 20:36.721
and frame me
to force the Federation

20:36.765 --> 20:40.725
into relocating them
to a more resource-rich planet.

20:40.769 --> 20:45.339
So, it was a classic Pakled
Samaritan Snare writ large,

20:45.382 --> 20:47.384
and it would have worked,

20:47.428 --> 20:49.560
if not for Starfleet's best

20:49.604 --> 20:52.563
believing in one of their own.

20:52.607 --> 20:54.565
Holy... [bleep].

20:54.609 --> 20:56.437
[groans] Can we hear that
again, please?

20:56.480 --> 20:58.134
Wow. Wow.

20:58.177 --> 20:59.744
Starfleet really came through.
Who'd have thought?

20:59.788 --> 21:01.268
Me, Beckett.

21:01.311 --> 21:03.879
I told you from the start
to trust in the system.

21:03.922 --> 21:05.315
I said it this morning.

21:05.359 --> 21:06.925
I bet your friends
told you just as much.

21:06.969 --> 21:09.319
Um... they might've said...
I mean, whatever,

21:09.363 --> 21:11.103
all that matters is
you're free, right, Mom?

21:11.147 --> 21:12.801
All's well that, you know,
turns out fine.

21:12.844 --> 21:14.846
[chuckles] Oh, no, no,
no, no, missy.

21:14.890 --> 21:17.022
Do you realize
I was out of court

21:17.066 --> 21:18.589
for less than an hour

21:18.633 --> 21:20.330
before I learn that my own

21:20.374 --> 21:23.333
daughter has stolen my ship
from a military impound?!

21:23.377 --> 21:25.335
You three, go start cleaning

21:25.379 --> 21:27.076
-whatever the hell this is.
-Uh, well, they're a type of

21:27.119 --> 21:28.904
incandescent extremoph... Mm...

21:28.947 --> 21:30.253
Yes, Captain.
Right away, Captain.

21:30.297 --> 21:31.559
And you?

21:31.602 --> 21:33.517
You're with me.

21:38.566 --> 21:40.524
[sighs] I blame myself.

21:40.568 --> 21:42.309
For wearing out that carpet?
Yeah, agreed.

21:42.352 --> 21:43.353
Beckett, come on.

21:43.397 --> 21:44.833
You see? You see, 'Zo?

21:44.876 --> 21:47.314
Even now, she thinks
she can just say

21:47.357 --> 21:50.099
and do whatever she wants
with no repercussions.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.883
'Cause you know what?
She could.

21:51.927 --> 21:54.364
This whole time,
we have covered for her

21:54.408 --> 21:57.976
and excused her, and now,
we are reaping what we sowed.

21:58.020 --> 21:59.978
Well, what do you want me
to say? I was trying to help.

22:00.022 --> 22:02.851
And I love you for that, I do.

22:02.894 --> 22:05.897
Honey, you have
so much potential,

22:05.941 --> 22:08.117
but if you're ever
going to amount to anything,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.902
it won't be because
you saw me as an authority.

22:10.946 --> 22:12.600
And we know how often
you listen to me.

22:12.643 --> 22:14.210
Ugh, here we go,
I'm being, what,

22:14.253 --> 22:15.907
demoted and transferred again?

22:15.951 --> 22:17.518
Where would you go?

22:17.561 --> 22:19.781
The Cerritosis still
your last chance.

22:19.824 --> 22:22.000
But I can't be the one
to rein you in.

22:22.044 --> 22:25.221
As your mother, I could never
kick you out of Starfleet.

22:25.264 --> 22:26.831
However,

22:26.875 --> 22:30.008
I know someone who
isn't burdened by family ties.

22:30.052 --> 22:31.836
-[door chimes]
-Come.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.837
MARINER:
No.

22:32.881 --> 22:34.056
Not him, not him.

22:34.099 --> 22:35.797
-No, no, no.
-Ensign Beckett Mariner,

22:35.840 --> 22:38.277
I'm giving your full
and final oversight

22:38.321 --> 22:39.844
to Commander Ransom.

22:39.888 --> 22:42.934
If you do in fact
want to remain in Starfleet,

22:42.978 --> 22:45.284
it's going to be his call.

22:45.328 --> 22:46.634
Thank you, Captain.

22:46.677 --> 22:48.462
As far as you're
concerned, Mariner,

22:48.505 --> 22:50.420
I'm your mama now.

22:51.813 --> 22:53.858
[vocalizing]

22:56.078 --> 22:59.168
Ah, you know, even covered
in alien sploof,

22:59.211 --> 23:00.735
there's no place I'd rather be.

23:00.778 --> 23:03.477
Yeah. Home, sticky home.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.174
Oh, hey, turn on FNN.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.219
Let's see if they're talking
about the trial.

23:07.263 --> 23:09.004
We'll talk to the little boy

23:09.047 --> 23:11.789
who solved
Fermat's last theorem.

23:11.833 --> 23:14.444
But first, a daring rescue
near the moons of Jupiter,

23:14.488 --> 23:16.751
as a malfunctioning
theme park ride

23:16.794 --> 23:18.753
leaves one young man
traumatized.

23:18.796 --> 23:21.408
No, no, let me go!
I'm Captain Gavin.

23:21.451 --> 23:23.235
I am on a trek
amongst the stars!

24:20.205 --> 24:21.685
[man imitates weapons firing]

24:23.644 --> 24:25.646
Chirp.
