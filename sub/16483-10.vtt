00:01.335 --> 00:03.254
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.421 --> 00:06.257
I've asked Agent Nathanson
to accompany Aida back to your lab.

00:06.424 --> 00:08.676
Oh, my God. What the...

00:10.386 --> 00:12.179
This is clearly the Darkhold's fault.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.598
- You're not getting that book.
- Yes, I am.

00:17.893 --> 00:20.604
Your previous model had
the Darkhold book in her hand.

00:20.813 --> 00:22.356
And all the answers it holds.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.858
You'll have to stay here for now

00:24.025 --> 00:26.110
until your substitute has served her
purpose.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.862
I said the new director should be
a powered person

00:28.029 --> 00:29.030
the public could trust.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.407
- And they came up with you.
- Look, we're both Inhuman.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.076
Why not make the most of it?
The public was turning against you.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.536
<i>Now, they look up to you.</i>

00:35.953 --> 00:38.622
Seems they look up to you,
too, the hero of Vienna.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.542
Not as big a deal as they made it.
They gave me too much credit.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.637
No, a true hero's
not in it for the glory.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.599
Some seek out justice in the face
of danger

00:57.266 --> 00:59.685
even if it means living life
in the shadows.

01:00.895 --> 01:04.690
But I'm proud to announce...
that Daisy Johnson,

01:04.857 --> 01:07.777
one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most dedicated
agents,

01:08.235 --> 01:11.155
can finally step
into the spotlight...

01:12.740 --> 01:14.909
and get the recognition she deserves.

01:25.795 --> 01:27.296
During her time undercover,

01:27.963 --> 01:30.466
she risked her life to protect
everyday citizens.

01:31.175 --> 01:34.136
When Watchdogs targeted the Edison Bridge,

01:34.929 --> 01:39.850
Agent Johnson held off the collapse
until everyone was evacuated.

01:40.559 --> 01:44.897
Now, she fled to protect her cover,
but today, we finally get to say...

01:47.066 --> 01:51.153
Thank you.

01:52.321 --> 01:56.659
Right now, I would like to invite
Sunbury's own Michelle Caldwell

01:56.826 --> 01:59.078
up to tell the story
in her own words.

02:03.541 --> 02:05.209
Thank you, Director Mace.

02:06.252 --> 02:08.378
It's hard to remember details
from that night,

02:08.628 --> 02:13.259
but three things stand out clearly.
Fire, falling...

02:14.969 --> 02:16.679
and Agent Johnson saving my life.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.931
I was heading home
on the Edison Bridge...

02:19.140 --> 02:21.392
Looks like Director Mace
is enjoying this more than Daisy.

02:22.852 --> 02:24.645
Know who's more excited about it
than either of them?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.357
General Talbot bails us out one time,

02:28.524 --> 02:30.234
then acts like we owe him
a damn parade.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.778
Yeah, he did what he had to do.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.949
- Though it didn't reduce his ego any.
- Burrows isn't helping, either.

02:37.241 --> 02:40.870
If he gets any further up Talbot's ass,
he'll need a snorkel.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.080
And there they go again

02:43.247 --> 02:45.416
with the world's
most conspicuous briefcase.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.667
What do you think's in there?

02:46.750 --> 02:49.461
Could be anything.
Nuclear codes, hush money...

02:49.962 --> 02:50.963
Girl Scout Cookies.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.220
What's up?

02:58.429 --> 02:59.889
We're supposed to have an agent
on that roof.

03:00.431 --> 03:03.475
...my son still has his mother,
thanks to Agent Johnson.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.646
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Oh.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.987
Yeah. Okay.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.701
Sniper! Get down!

03:27.958 --> 03:29.418
Stand clear!

03:35.549 --> 03:38.886
- I've got eyes on the shooter.
- Sir, wait! You're on the clock.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.981
Coulson, we're initiating
Contingency Plan Foxhole.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.192
- Get the director outta here, pronto.
- Already on it.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.072
Sir, we need to get you
to a safe house.

03:58.155 --> 04:01.075
- We have a Quinjet standing by.
- Lead the way. Burrows, with me.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.309
What is that doing out?

04:27.518 --> 04:29.979
Um, Agent Fitz asked us
to keep it out for a few tests.

04:30.521 --> 04:33.232
The only test anyone should be
running is how best to destroy it.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.026
That thing killed Nathanson.
Could've killed us all.

04:36.652 --> 04:39.071
I'll talk to Agent Fitz,
make sure he hasn't forgotten that.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.324
And in the meantime...
don't go near it.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.994
What now?

04:51.041 --> 04:53.627
- How did the shooter get close enough?
- What's going on?

04:53.877 --> 04:55.713
There was an assassination attempt
on Director Mace.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.673
- What? Is he...
- He's fine.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.551
Coulson and Mack are following
protocol, taking him to a safe house.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.928
What do we know about this guy Daisy
grabbed? Who's he working for?

05:03.095 --> 05:04.430
Would you stop hounding me
with questions?

05:04.596 --> 05:06.974
Get in there and ask him yourself.
I need you in the interrogation room.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.434
I don't trust
Little Miss Richter Scale

05:08.600 --> 05:11.186
- to handle it herself.
- I take orders from the director,

05:11.353 --> 05:12.938
- not you.
- May's right.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.648
Maybe we should check
with Director Mace.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.109
Well, he's not gonna get here
in time, so I'm taking the reins.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.402
And here's how it's gonna go down.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.280
You, get Lee Harvey whatever to talk.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.907
You, find out if Burrows
was on the Quinjet.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.909
- Excuse me?
- And you, hey, with the hair

05:26.327 --> 05:29.413
Get me a coffee. And don't forget
the French vanilla creamer this time.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.791
Agent May,

05:33.125 --> 05:35.544
with the possible exception
of my mother, you are

05:35.669 --> 05:38.172
the single most intimidating woman
I have ever met.

05:39.214 --> 05:42.134
We need answers. You can get them.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.345
Fine.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.182
<i>She was designed
for this very purpose.</i>

05:48.599 --> 05:52.478
Aida was meant to save lives,
prevent assassination attempts.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.855
But instead we just had a funeral
for Agent Nathanson.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.066
Yeah, yeah.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.026
A painful loss, we all agree.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.779
But look, I can figure out
what went wrong.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.781
Let me examine her! I'll pinpoint
the problem, we can...

06:04.198 --> 06:05.949
- Radcliffe.
- ...sort it, restart the program.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.785
I don't think that's the best idea
just now.

06:09.787 --> 06:13.665
Tempers are running high
after... the incident.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.921
I think you should steer clear of HQ
for a few days.

06:20.089 --> 06:22.299
Who's this coming from? The Director?
Agent Coulson?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.719
Yep and yep.
Along with everybody else.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.638
But it'll blow over.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.933
And in the meantime, I'll still
pop 'round for football matches.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.227
Whatever you think is best...

06:35.687 --> 06:36.730
All right.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.320
This is not good.
Not good at all.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.989
Aida!

06:49.118 --> 06:50.619
Get me two... no, four aspirin.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.498
If you have a headache,
I could get the acupuncture needles.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.166
No, the pills are fine.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.044
We have a problem with Agent May.

07:01.547 --> 07:02.714
She's in a better place now.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.676
No, the... the May LMD.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.679
Apparently, I am unwelcome
at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters,

07:08.846 --> 07:10.305
so she's all on her own.

07:10.681 --> 07:13.058
This is unprecedented technology
at play here.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.810
I need to keep an eye on her.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.688
The slightest miscalculation
could reveal her true nature.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.066
I have confidence in you, Doctor.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.944
Of course, you do.
But if she draws suspicion,

07:24.111 --> 07:25.362
this is all for naught.

07:29.616 --> 07:34.997
Yuri Zaikin, Russian national.
Ex-KGB, ex-HYDRA.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.916
S.H.I.E.L.D. thought you died
in the battle over the Fridge.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.712
Well, it's too bad you didn't.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.591
You killed a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,

07:45.799 --> 07:48.010
tried to kill the director
with exploding bullets.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.387
They don't sell those at Walmart,
yet.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.433
Who's your supplier?

07:57.769 --> 07:59.605
You just don't shut up, do you?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.569
You've got an angle here?

08:07.237 --> 08:10.282
When they don't talk, usually means
they have someone to protect.

08:10.574 --> 08:11.658
So, he's just a lackey.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.785
Probably why there wasn't
an extraction plan.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.829
Send in the dumb guy
they can afford to lose.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.164
No wonder he failed.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.832
We didn't fail.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.171
Phase One only ever had a 13 percent
chance of success.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.093
<i>Doesn't make any sense.</i>

08:30.427 --> 08:33.054
We had agents all over the place,
not to mention two Inhumans.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.807
Who would send a sniper in there
and think they could get away with it?

08:35.974 --> 08:37.226
Smart money's on the Watchdogs.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.770
Though Senator Nadeer may have
pointed them in my direction.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.145
She's on the Intelligence Committee,

08:41.313 --> 08:42.688
so she had access
to my event schedule.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.317
Nadeer has motive,
but she's too smart to tie herself

08:45.484 --> 08:47.528
to the assassination of an American hero.

08:47.945 --> 08:51.240
- And Mack's right. Their plan was sloppy.
- Oh, silver lining?

08:51.490 --> 08:53.450
Director looked like a total hero,
throwing that podium.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.786
I bet every network is covering it.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.413
There is no silver lining
for that dead agent's family.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.123
Agent Mackenzie has a point.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.001
McCafferty,
can we get HQ on the line?

09:03.418 --> 09:04.419
Working on it, sir...

09:06.255 --> 09:07.297
There's some interference.

09:07.506 --> 09:11.343
I'm having the same problem.
If I could just get a couple of bars,

09:11.510 --> 09:12.719
and see if we're trending...

09:16.515 --> 09:18.725
- No.
- We've lost the port engine!

09:20.477 --> 09:21.687
Everybody hold on!

09:36.243 --> 09:38.662
Everyone okay?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.956
Still breathing.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.624
I'm fine.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.461
McCafferty, you all right?

09:49.047 --> 09:50.340
McCafferty?

09:55.554 --> 09:57.055
He's dead.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.316
The assassination attempt...
this crash,

10:07.608 --> 10:10.736
- it's not a coincidence.
- No. Whoever came after us,

10:11.194 --> 10:13.655
anticipated the protocols,
knew we'd fly to safety.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.533
The sniper was just their first move.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.869
Sabotaging the Quinjet was plan B.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.748
There's no comms.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.542
Crash must've cut the power.
I can still try to fix it.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.545
HQ can still track
the transponder signal.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.756
Search and rescue
should already be on the way.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.883
May not be that easy.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.847
- Damn it.
- Can't be another EMP.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.267
Our tech is working.
Just can't get a connection.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.519
Well, if this was their plan B,

10:45.020 --> 10:47.481
we can only assume
plan C isn't far behind.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.107
Yep.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.610
And I don't feel like sticking around
to find out what that is.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.195
We're sitting ducks here.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.822
We need to get to high ground, try to get
a signal for this sat phone.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.241
First, we find Burrows.

10:59.910 --> 11:03.246
Burrows? Sir, the chance
of him surviving is practically...

11:03.413 --> 11:05.082
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't leave
a man behind.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.462
You really think this is our best move?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.089
You know the saying...

11:12.339 --> 11:15.050
If a jet crashes in the woods
and there's no one there to hear it,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.386
stay close to the guy with super-strength.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.227
Oh, boy.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.627
I thought this scenario
was supposed to keep her calm.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.380
It's unclear
why her neocortical activity

11:53.547 --> 11:56.299
is so erratic.
The environment is quite peaceful.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.343
We're gathering very useful data.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.513
Well, as long as we're
not causing the poor woman any undue harm.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.265
There's been enough of that around.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.142
Last thing we need is another incident.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.729
You're referencing the actions I took
to protect your secret?

12:09.020 --> 12:12.774
Well, the protection I appreciate.
The homicide was a bridge too far.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.527
My parameters place your security
above all others.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.363
- You would have been exposed.
- I was exposed when they found a corpse!

12:18.572 --> 12:20.574
If I terminate anyone else
for your protection,

12:20.824 --> 12:22.242
I will dispose of the body more
discreetly.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.286
No. Don't terminate anyone!

12:26.037 --> 12:29.249
I have to calibrate your settings
down to something a little less lethal.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.755
My apologies.
I only follow your directives.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.882
Yeah, well, sometimes you follow them
a little too well.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.884
Agent Simmons knew
what you were at immediately.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.261
Agent May's decoy
will be more convincing.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.929
She's more advanced than I am.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.098
Yes, and you know what you are.
She doesn't.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.809
Her programming operates
on a subconscious level.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.145
And you believe this will keep her
from being noticed?

12:50.353 --> 12:52.898
If Agent May isn't aware
of her mission to retrieve the Darkhold,

12:53.023 --> 12:54.524
then she won't be able
to reveal herself.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.110
Her programming will present
as human emotion.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.280
She'll instinctively climb the ranks,
gain access,

13:00.530 --> 13:02.240
and get closer to Agent Coulson,

13:02.407 --> 13:05.160
the man who knows
just where this book is.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.245
It might be quicker for me to search
the base myself.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.414
No, I've tried the quick way.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.375
Now we're playing
a longer, more nuanced game,

13:12.584 --> 13:14.336
hopefully with less violence.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.172
But isn't the real Agent May
already prone to violence?

13:23.553 --> 13:26.932
- How do you lose a damn Quinjet?
- Simmons, tell me they're alive.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.559
I don't know. We lost contact
approximately seven minutes ago.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.895
Zaikin said he wasn't alone.
This must be Phase Two.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.147
Then we may need
more than the standard rescue team.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.857
General, have we made contact?

13:36.024 --> 13:37.692
They just dropped off the map.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.653
No signal, no emergency beacon,
nothing.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.072
It could be an equipment malfunction.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.157
When have we ever been that lucky?

13:44.533 --> 13:46.451
If we want our team back,
we're gonna have to act fast.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.495
Daisy and I can take point on the rescue
mission.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.997
Coulson would want me to take command
of Zephyr One.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.625
Simmons, I need expanded clearance
to do that.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.710
I'll take care of that.

13:56.753 --> 14:01.341
I'll make you... DayGlo Pink,
or whatever's high enough.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.970
If we find them, they won't be alone.
Zaikin had partners.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.429
I'm the highest-ranking agent here,

14:06.721 --> 14:08.682
and contingency protocols grant me
greater access

14:08.974 --> 14:10.225
if the director is missing in action.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.644
I know that.
I wrote the damn protocols.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.145
Besides, I have an assignment
for you.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.314
But I could look through Mace's file
for any leads.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.941
If we've overlooked any enemies
he might have...

14:18.108 --> 14:20.527
I'll handle this.
I'm gonna squeeze our prisoner

14:20.694 --> 14:23.238
like a lime wedge
on dollar beer night.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.576
Now, find me some science-y way

14:27.742 --> 14:29.286
to regain contact with our men
on the ground.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.704
But we...

14:33.248 --> 14:34.332
You all have jobs to do.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.462
If you'll excuse me, I need to update
the leader of the free world.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.223
Mr President. We don't know
who survived,

14:50.765 --> 14:53.101
but I've got our top agents searching
for the Quinjet.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.980
Agent Burrows has the package,
but we don't know if he was onboard.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.399
Yes, sir.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.860
Let's hope for all our sakes
that Director Mace got it.

15:04.321 --> 15:08.074
Burrows should have landed...
northwest of here.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.244
Director, we may want to consider
our options here.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.830
Given our altitude
when the door blew,

15:13.914 --> 15:15.206
the chances that Burrows
survived that...

15:15.290 --> 15:16.958
I know we're only looking for a body
at this point,

15:17.042 --> 15:18.335
but it's still the right thing to do.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.295
Or you really need that briefcase.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.049
All you need to know
is it's classified.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.550
You know the drill.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.052
All too well,
but I still don't know...

15:27.135 --> 15:28.261
Wait. Hold up, hold up.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.389
You hear those engines?

15:47.656 --> 15:49.824
That truck must be scrambling
our communications.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.201
I've seen tech like that...

15:51.785 --> 15:53.536
When we took out a HYDRA stronghold
in Argentina.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.206
Can't be HYDRA. I thought
you and Talbot put those guys to bed.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.832
We dismantled their network,

15:57.999 --> 15:59.960
but that just sent the rats
scurrying off the sinking ship.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.713
From squid to rat to mutt.
Perfect Watchdog material.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.675
Priority one is to destroy that truck
so we can call for backup.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.844
- No. Too risky.
- What?

16:10.220 --> 16:12.597
We stick to the plan. Find the case.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.018
Like it or not, he's in charge.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.983
Keep me updated, Agent Crawford.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.734
- Coulson?
- We don't know.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.529
Daisy and May are looking
while I try to restore communication.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.614
And General Talbot's here, "helping"?

16:29.864 --> 16:32.867
- In his own way.
- Soothing as sandpaper, that guy.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.870
You collected your stuff
from Radcliffe's place?

16:36.496 --> 16:37.539
Yeah, I did.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.208
And, um, hopefully, he takes
my advice and lays low for a while.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.877
- It's for the best.
- Yeah, absolutely...

16:43.336 --> 16:45.213
Even though the program did show promise.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.299
Well... promising or not, it was
a mistake.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.302
You're right, you're right, but...

16:52.595 --> 16:56.266
I mean, just to be clear,
the mistake wasn't the program,

16:56.433 --> 16:58.727
- it was keeping the program from you.
- Fitz, let's not.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.812
I know, but you were the brain
we needed on this.

17:00.979 --> 17:04.273
So maybe we could just reboot
the head in a controlled environment,

17:04.441 --> 17:05.900
and then we could diagnose
the problem together.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.111
Please! Drop it.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.994
Can we just let it go?
Our friends are missing...

17:17.829 --> 17:19.914
- maybe dead.
- Yeah, as always.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.336
I just want you to understand,
that I only wanted...

17:25.462 --> 17:27.464
To prevent this very thing. I know.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.175
- You're trying to protect...
- To protect you.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.264
We'll find them.

17:37.557 --> 17:42.979
Daisy's back on the team. And, uh...
May's too stubborn to give up.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.902
Aida, no!

18:34.823 --> 18:36.658
I knew it wasn't real.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.285
Aida, don't kill her!

18:44.249 --> 18:46.543
The syringe, Aida.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.170
We have to sedate her.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.509
You bastard.

19:08.898 --> 19:12.318
What was that? She was supposed to be
in a relaxing simulation.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.904
She was in a day spa, getting
a hot-stone massage.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.282
How hot did you make the stones?

19:18.783 --> 19:21.744
I did exactly as you asked.

19:26.124 --> 19:29.127
Well, at least you didn't snap
her neck, so that's an improvement.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.255
Fetch some restraints.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.134
We may have misjudged what it takes
to keep Agent May comfortable.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.649
So you're allowed to touch Lola?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.822
Wanted to let you know we're a few minutes
out from the crash site.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.255
Did he ever let you drive her?

20:20.220 --> 20:23.181
I have this one image in my head...

20:23.848 --> 20:26.559
an early mission of ours, maybe in Madrid?

20:27.936 --> 20:30.355
Coulson had a moustache.

20:30.647 --> 20:34.609
He gave me the keys,
and told me not to let anyone else know.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.823
- We're gonna find them, you know.
- I know.

20:42.700 --> 20:46.788
I just... can't shake this feeling...
Something's off.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.629
Off how? With the mission
or between you and...

20:56.589 --> 20:58.675
Did I miss something
while I was gone?

20:59.175 --> 21:01.886
- Like what?
- You know like what.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.348
Agent May!
We've reached the crash site,

21:05.640 --> 21:07.892
but we scanned for 100 square miles
and there's no Quinjet.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.228
Someone must have hijacked
the transponder signal.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.771
So, where the hell are they?

21:15.942 --> 21:18.486
- All right, let's go, let's go!
- Well, this is a fly in the ointment.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.655
This squad must've been searching
the debris trail.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.407
Who knows how many others are out there?

21:25.368 --> 21:27.287
How worried should we be about them
getting into that thing?

21:27.745 --> 21:29.872
It's biometrically locked.
Only I can open it.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.250
Unless they use explosives.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.628
Still don't feel like telling us
what's inside?

21:38.840 --> 21:40.091
Then I guess we're doing this.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.969
Mack and I can go around,
ice the three on the far side.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.595
Director, you take out
the two by the case.

21:44.679 --> 21:45.888
Are we sure there aren't more inside?

21:45.972 --> 21:48.891
If there are, you can always shot put
them with your super-strength.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.143
Yeah.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.317
- I'll make it work.
- We have to move now.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.572
<i>You need a new strategy, son.</i>

22:03.364 --> 22:05.366
This silent treatment isn't working
for you.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.328
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

22:10.246 --> 22:13.416
How did you know the director
was going to get on the Quinjet?

22:14.709 --> 22:18.588
Probability...
We consider every scenario...

22:19.380 --> 22:22.008
and all eventualities lead
to our target's death.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.891
This little mathlete stunt what kept
you alive when I wiped out HYDRA?

22:31.559 --> 22:32.769
That's right...

22:33.561 --> 22:36.981
I personally had the pleasure
of putting your outfit down.

22:38.316 --> 22:43.279
And believe me when I tell you,
I can make Siberia feel like a luau

22:43.446 --> 22:45.656
if you don't start giving me
some answers.

22:48.368 --> 22:51.871
The hammer shatters glass
but hardens steel.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.332
You are glass.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.293
Okay, Pushkin.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.090
I'll go get a hammer.

23:06.511 --> 23:10.723
I miss the Cold War...
A man could do his job

23:10.890 --> 23:12.642
without one hand tied behind his back.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.978
What, you've never been tempted
to use every tool in the box?

23:16.521 --> 23:18.981
A spud wrench? Hay hook?
Plugging chisel?

23:19.399 --> 23:20.900
Are you speaking English?

23:22.360 --> 23:23.611
Never mind.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.697
How's, uh, the location on Mace?

23:27.657 --> 23:30.410
Tracking the Quinjet's
proving near impossible.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.830
The saboteurs have projected
a false transponder signal

23:33.996 --> 23:35.581
while simultaneously jamming
the real one.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.959
We have no way to contact
the director or the Quinjet

23:38.126 --> 23:40.253
while this jamming equipment
is still active.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.505
This is clearly more
than just some...

23:42.797 --> 23:46.300
pissed-off former squid heads.
Someone with means is backing them.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.470
And someone with motive. Could be
Watchdogs, Senator Nadeer,

23:49.679 --> 23:52.265
again why I should perform
a thorough analysis of Mace's file.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.267
Leave the who and the why to me.
Just keep working.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.936
Every minute we waste places
our friends in greater danger.

23:57.103 --> 24:00.231
- I told you, I've got this.
- You may mean well, General,

24:00.523 --> 24:02.483
but you are impeding my ability to...

24:05.361 --> 24:08.156
- What is it?
- This section of Mace's file...

24:09.073 --> 24:10.158
Project Patriot...

24:10.741 --> 24:13.077
The only people who have access
are Director Mace,

24:13.244 --> 24:15.580
General Talbot, Agent Burrows,
and now me.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.790
You mentioned Burrows earlier.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.877
- Any chance it's because of this project?
- Not relevant.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.504
Burrows is always following the director
about with that briefcase...

24:24.797 --> 24:27.425
- It's not very subtle.
- What aren't you telling us, General?

24:29.302 --> 24:31.971
You two do not want to get into this
right now with me.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.725
You knew I had access.
You wrote the protocols, right?

24:35.892 --> 24:37.894
And have been
intentionally steering me away.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.482
You want to tell us why?
Or should I just read the file myself...

24:44.567 --> 24:45.693
aloud?

24:48.070 --> 24:52.241
- Clear the room.
- Hey, everybody out.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.209
There's a very good reason

25:01.334 --> 25:04.629
Director Mace is never
too far away from that briefcase.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.483
Man down!

25:28.986 --> 25:30.363
Nice shot.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.923
Hey!

25:59.016 --> 26:01.185
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.302
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

26:41.142 --> 26:43.185
What happened?

26:43.644 --> 26:45.062
It was just one guy.
You could've crushed him.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.322
No, he couldn't.
He doesn't have Inhuman powers.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.409
He doesn't have powers at all.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.755
Thanks.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.135
This is what gave you
your super-strength? What is it?

27:17.386 --> 27:19.555
Some sort of drug cocktail.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.308
- So, steroids on steroids?
- Yeah.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.144
You probably should've asked
for more specifics.

27:26.771 --> 27:29.774
I know it was uniquely calibrated
for my DNA.

27:30.191 --> 27:33.069
They told me it would make me strong,
and it did.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.237
I never questioned the science
behind it.

27:35.488 --> 27:36.906
And who exactly is "they"?

27:39.200 --> 27:40.242
Talbot.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.203
Look, it's not like we gave him
cancer.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.247
- He's a superhero now.
- But you lied to all of us.

27:45.831 --> 27:49.418
It's a choice I stand by still,
100 percent. You didn't need to know.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.295
Why did you fake his abilities?

27:52.546 --> 27:54.256
Well, the decision was made
that the new director

27:54.423 --> 27:57.593
had to be enhanced.
No candidate fit that criteria.

27:58.511 --> 28:01.138
- So we made one.
- You restarted the Erskine program.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.308
There's no program. Just took
a very well-vetted candidate

28:04.517 --> 28:06.185
and turned him into the hero
and leader that we needed.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.270
- So how'd you do it?
- Targeted gene therapy?

28:08.479 --> 28:09.480
Biomechanical implants?

28:09.855 --> 28:12.525
Actually, we used a modified version
of that formula

28:12.692 --> 28:14.443
you confiscated
from Agent Johnson's father.

28:14.568 --> 28:15.569
- That's horrible!
- Are you mad?

28:15.736 --> 28:17.863
- Think of the formula's side effects
- You never fought a juiced-up Cal.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.490
- aggression, mood swings?
- The guy nearly killed us.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.409
We're not idiots.
We took the bad stuff out.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.327
Most of it, anyway.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.788
Oh, oh, okay. So you're just...
you're just mostly idiots.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.248
Mostly.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.292
We only gave it to him when he needed
to put on a show for a congressman,

28:30.543 --> 28:32.628
say, lift a car, something like that.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.715
He was coming off the final dose
when Zaikin took a shot at him.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.216
We don't know if he got the next one.

28:38.259 --> 28:39.885
Which is what Burrows
had in that briefcase.

28:40.136 --> 28:44.515
Without it... Mace is about as strong
as a paper bag in a rainstorm.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.351
Explains why you were so eager
to find Burrows.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.895
God, I shouldn't have dragged him
into this.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.690
And you two, I hate that you're
out here without protection.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.359
What, you think we need you
to protect us?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.362
No, I...

29:01.198 --> 29:02.241
No.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.871
And I only lied,
'cause those were my orders.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.874
When your country calls, you answer.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.709
Yeah, well, you won't be
answering anything

29:11.792 --> 29:13.794
if we don't get that bullet wound
patched up.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.590
Maybe there's a first-aid kit
in that ranger station.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.731
Not a great time for round two.

29:48.329 --> 29:50.206
So even if they survived the crash,

29:50.372 --> 29:51.624
they could be stranded
in the wilderness,

29:51.832 --> 29:53.667
on the run from a band
of ex-HYDRA thugs,

29:53.918 --> 29:57.505
unaware that their enhanced asset
is a charlatan.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.758
No need to be so melodramatic,
Poppins, but yeah, that's it.

30:01.383 --> 30:04.720
Fitz, is there any other way
to fix the transponder signal?

30:05.429 --> 30:07.932
Scrambled. If I had a day,
maybe I could find a workaround,

30:08.098 --> 30:11.268
- but in an hour, not so much.
- Then we need to break Zaikin.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.770
There's no time for anything else.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.231
What do you think I've been trying
to do? The Russki isn't talking.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.274
Yeah, all right, well, we need
to come at it from a different angle.

30:17.358 --> 30:19.109
We have to try and find a way
to motivate him.

30:23.614 --> 30:24.740
I know that look.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.661
I don't... What are you thinking?

30:38.170 --> 30:42.508
I've seen American movies.
Good cop, bad cop, no?

30:43.133 --> 30:45.469
- I told you I'd bring a hammer.
- Mm.

30:45.719 --> 30:48.055
It wasn't just HYDRA who had
operatives within S.H.I.E.L.D.

30:49.223 --> 30:52.726
It was the other way around, too.
I learned a lot undercover.

30:52.977 --> 30:56.897
I can't deny HYDRA had some
very persuasive interrogation methods.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.151
You like statistics, here's one for you...

31:01.819 --> 31:04.029
There's a 100-percent chance
I get inside your head.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.323
The question is how long you'll live
afterwards.

31:07.658 --> 31:11.620
You're so weak.
You bring in this woman, to scare me?

31:12.496 --> 31:14.456
The last HYDRA operative we captured

31:14.623 --> 31:17.042
didn't take Agent Simmons seriously,
either.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.629
What's that saying you're so fond of
at HYDRA?

31:30.806 --> 31:33.100
<i>Zaikin admitted
to being hired by the Watchdogs.</i>

31:33.350 --> 31:35.769
<i>Their plan was to take down
the Quinjet in rural West Virginia.</i>

31:36.228 --> 31:38.022
We weren't even searching
in the right state.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.399
<i>The comms are still jammed but at least
we've narrowed down the search area.</i>

31:40.566 --> 31:42.860
Well, hopefully Mace can hold
these guys off until we find them.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.739
<i>Yeah... Um, I'm not so sure
about that.</i>

31:50.910 --> 31:53.370
Won't be long before they find
the other guys we iced.

31:54.705 --> 31:55.789
What's the situation?

31:56.040 --> 31:57.666
Well, we got good news
and bad news.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.502
The good news is, the transmitter truck's
parked out by that tool shed,

32:00.586 --> 32:01.837
so we got a chance to disable it.

32:02.004 --> 32:04.256
But the bad news, there's a squad
of heavily armed mercs guarding it.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.675
And it's only a matter of minutes
till they bust down that door.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.428
Should've left me in the woods
when you had the chance.

32:09.803 --> 32:13.182
Not helping. What's the plan, sir?

32:24.902 --> 32:26.278
Time to suit up, Director.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.073
You heard the part where I don't have
powers, right?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.575
Yeah... but they don't know that.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.127
You know you're being lied to,
right?

32:42.920 --> 32:44.880
I can only speculate
as to who hired you,

32:45.339 --> 32:47.424
Probably some burly guys
in dog masks,

32:47.925 --> 32:49.718
but they're working
for Senator Nadeer,

32:50.135 --> 32:53.138
And what she really wants
is inside this case.

32:53.555 --> 32:56.850
- It's a cure, for Inhumans.
- Hold your fire.

32:57.851 --> 33:00.521
I don't suppose she told you
how much this was worth.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.439
Probably a lot more
than she's paying you.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.442
If you're making me an offer,
get on with it.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.909
Looks like we got two choices here.

33:15.285 --> 33:18.455
Either I crush this case down
to the size of a baseball,

33:18.956 --> 33:20.332
and nobody gets what they want,

33:21.041 --> 33:23.752
- or...
- Or we could kill you and take it.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.382
Try if you want.
I'm ready to go toe-to-toe all day.

33:30.134 --> 33:32.052
But I'm the only one who can open
this case.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.915
I'd rather end this...
without any bloodshed,

34:02.416 --> 34:03.667
by which I mean yours.

34:04.418 --> 34:07.421
So why don't you just put your guns
down and, uh,

34:07.671 --> 34:09.047
we'll talk this through.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.149
- I don't think they want to talk.
- You distracted them long enough.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.027
- Mack made short work of that truck.
- So, what do we do now?

34:30.485 --> 34:31.570
Survive.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.137
It's not an axe, but I'll take it.

35:05.562 --> 35:08.398
- I'm running out.
- Yeah, I'm running low, too.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.442
Help me get this table.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.491
They're about to breach that door.
How's your aim?

35:17.741 --> 35:19.910
Talbot ran me through some
basic training when I got this job,

35:20.077 --> 35:23.122
but I didn't think I'd need it...
with the super-strength and all.

35:23.497 --> 35:25.916
No better time to practice
than when your life depends on it.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.295
Is that...

35:40.597 --> 35:41.807
Where's Mack?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.314
I'm gonna make this hurt!

35:52.693 --> 35:53.735
It's about damn time.

36:16.592 --> 36:20.012
- You okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.183
All right,
let's get the hell out of here.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.604
<i>Agent May is resilient.</i>

36:28.896 --> 36:31.231
She never stops fighting,
yet she showed more distress

36:31.356 --> 36:33.233
before she woke than during the fight.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.694
That's odd.

36:39.323 --> 36:42.659
No... that makes perfect sense.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.872
The flaw isn't in the hardware.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.041
It was in May herself.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.126
The simulation was rejected

36:51.335 --> 36:54.880
because Agent May thrives in conflict
and chaos, not tranquillity.

36:55.047 --> 36:57.341
- She's a warrior.
- You're saying fighting against me

36:57.507 --> 36:59.051
- stabilised her?
- Precisely.

36:59.343 --> 37:00.719
If we want her to accept
the simulation,

37:00.886 --> 37:03.347
we need to give her an opponent
to fight, an enemy to vanquish,

37:03.555 --> 37:06.016
- a dragon to slay.
- Shall I design a dragon?

37:06.183 --> 37:07.434
No.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.146
I have something else in mind.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.153
Don't worry.
I'm gonna figure out what broke you.

37:18.946 --> 37:22.824
<i>- Thank you, Fitz. Thank you.</i>
- Fitz?

37:31.291 --> 37:35.462
- Ah, there you are. You hungry?
- Yeah. Famished.

37:36.672 --> 37:41.218
I was, um... just locking away
Aida's head... For good.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.387
Let's never look at that awful thing
again.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.305
Yeah. Well, you never know.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.808
You might want to go all Godfather
on somebody else.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.436
Is it weird
that I found that attractive?

37:51.645 --> 37:52.813
Yes.

37:54.815 --> 37:57.609
- You handled Talbot like a pro.
- Oh, please.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.028
Coulson always made it look so easy.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.948
Really, Glenn?
You should be thanking me.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.658
We're in the middle of an arms race.

38:04.825 --> 38:08.078
World War III is gonna be decided
by whoever has more enhanced assets.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.289
You need Inhumans to trust
S.H.I.E.L.D.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.416
And your plan to earn their trust
was to lie to them?

38:12.624 --> 38:15.127
If you'd consulted me, I probably
would have advised against that...

38:15.294 --> 38:16.628
Which is exactly why I didn't.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.588
Keep digging that hole,
see how that works out for you.

38:18.839 --> 38:22.843
You needed a face for your poster.
Fine. Your girl Daisy went rogue.

38:23.343 --> 38:26.638
The President tasked me with finding
the next Captain America.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.932
Not an easy job, but I did it.

38:29.099 --> 38:32.144
I delivered a patriot,
a bona fide American hero!

38:32.853 --> 38:34.980
That man could have done anything
after Vienna.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.356
General?

38:37.649 --> 38:38.984
Could we have the room, please?

38:40.986 --> 38:42.112
What?

38:42.946 --> 38:46.033
You're taking his side?
After everything we've done for you?

38:47.492 --> 38:48.577
Please.

38:51.913 --> 38:53.040
You'd think a damn spy

38:53.123 --> 38:55.125
would understand the need
to keep a secret.

39:05.302 --> 39:08.805
After the explosion,
everything was... chaos.

39:10.182 --> 39:12.476
People were... screaming.

39:14.561 --> 39:15.979
I had smoke in my eyes.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.402
I wanted to get to safety...

39:24.404 --> 39:25.614
and...

39:26.948 --> 39:27.991
I tripped.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.578
I didn't even know she was there.

39:33.330 --> 39:36.458
- Someone snapped a picture.
- So you just went with it.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.796
I tried to deflect.
Everyone thought I was being modest.

39:43.340 --> 39:46.843
But they were treating me
like the man I always wanted to be.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.263
Few months later, Talbot
came to me with an offer.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.767
I thought I could be the face to end
Inhuman prejudice.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.603
- And you wanted to help.
- I thought I could.

39:57.687 --> 40:01.775
I believe... that Inhumans deserve
the same rights...

40:02.484 --> 40:04.152
as anyone else in this country.

40:09.616 --> 40:10.951
I'll call a press conference...

40:12.411 --> 40:13.453
resign...

40:14.621 --> 40:16.164
reinstate you as director.

40:23.296 --> 40:24.923
You're not going anywhere.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.886
- Excuse me?
- S.H.I.E.L.D. still needs a face.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.097
Sure, you lied,
but you were good at it,

40:32.556 --> 40:34.599
even with a gun pointed at you,
and that's not nothing.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.436
So... so what do you...
What do you want me to do?

40:37.936 --> 40:38.937
Same thing you've been doing.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.731
Defend S.H.I.E.L.D. to the public,
play the hero.

40:42.149 --> 40:45.819
Keep the title, handle the politics.
I never loved that part, anyway.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.406
But when it comes to operations,
make no mistake.

40:50.532 --> 40:53.452
From now on... I'm calling the shots.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.177
Ah.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.274
- Hey.
- Hey, you need help with that?

41:24.900 --> 41:27.277
Uh. No. It's, uh, it's just a scratch.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.780
Um. Coulson's gathering everyone
in the director's office.

41:31.490 --> 41:32.824
I'll see you in there.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.662
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Never better.
