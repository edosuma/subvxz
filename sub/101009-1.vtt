00:53.161 --> 00:54.929
<i>Good
evening, my fellow Americans.</i>

00:54.963 --> 00:57.832
<i>It's me,
your last semblance of a decent,</i>

00:57.865 --> 01:00.469
<i>law-abiding, qualified
president, Barack Obama...</i>

01:00.502 --> 01:03.838
<i>here to introduce to you
the trailer...</i>

01:03.871 --> 01:05.807
<i>for Marques Black's
new film...</i>

01:05.840 --> 01:07.509
<i>Uh...</i>
Secret Service Man.

01:09.043 --> 01:12.348
<i>Now, although
I am highly disappointed</i>

01:12.381 --> 01:14.115
<i>with our current president,</i>

01:14.148 --> 01:15.917
<i>I gotta say...</i>

01:15.950 --> 01:18.019
<i>Marques Black's career
choices of late</i>

01:18.052 --> 01:20.222
<i>have disappointed me far more.</i>

01:20.256 --> 01:21.457
<i>That's right, Marques.</i>

01:21.490 --> 01:25.361
<i>You are single-handedly
responsible for disappointing</i>

01:25.394 --> 01:27.529
<i>the world's most
beloved black man.</i>

01:29.163 --> 01:31.165
<i>I'm just kidding!
What's up with y'all, baby?</i>

01:31.200 --> 01:33.569
<i>It's Deandre McDonald.</i>

01:33.602 --> 01:35.304
Okay, here talking shit

01:35.337 --> 01:37.939
about Marques Black's
latest piece of shit.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.007
Okay, that's wrong of me.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.908
See, I think
it's a piece of shit.

01:40.942 --> 01:44.246
<i>But here, watch this
shitty new trailer</i>

01:44.280 --> 01:47.516
<i>and just show me and tell me
how shitty you think it is.</i>

01:47.549 --> 01:49.184
<i>Roll that beautiful
bean footage.</i>

01:53.589 --> 01:55.457
I don't need more
protection.

01:55.491 --> 01:57.892
Sir, we have it on good
authority that an attempt

01:57.925 --> 02:00.028
will definitely be made
on your life.

02:00.061 --> 02:02.564
But why?
What have I ever done to anybody?

02:04.065 --> 02:05.334
Yeah.

02:07.035 --> 02:08.336
<i>At some point...</i>

02:08.370 --> 02:10.406
That's better than Tiger.

02:10.439 --> 02:12.374
<i>...in every man's life...</i>

02:12.408 --> 02:14.976
Go, go, go! Make him run,
make him run.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.412
<i>...he gets a chance...</i>

02:16.445 --> 02:18.280
I already have enough blacks.

02:18.314 --> 02:19.914
What do I need
with this black?

02:19.947 --> 02:23.252
Sir, he is the best black
for the job.

02:24.486 --> 02:26.488
<i>...to be great.</i>

02:26.921 --> 02:27.989
So close.

02:28.022 --> 02:31.327
Now, I know that being late
is your people's thang...

02:31.360 --> 02:33.262
but I can't risk
losing my life

02:33.295 --> 02:35.197
because you're on CP time.
Does that make sense?

02:35.230 --> 02:37.333
Yes, sir. My baby mama's
been tripping.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.901
Who, Shanika?
She was tripping?

02:39.934 --> 02:41.035
He's got a gun!

02:41.069 --> 02:43.272
<i>Marques Black is...</i>

02:46.542 --> 02:48.577
Did good by you, sir,
didn't I?

02:48.610 --> 02:50.646
Eh. You were just okay.

02:50.679 --> 02:52.214
Come on, let's get
the hell out of here.

02:52.247 --> 02:54.516
...Secret Service Man.

02:58.454 --> 03:00.422
<i>Marques, Marques,
Marques. Um...</i>

03:00.456 --> 03:02.257
<i>Marques, I can only imagine</i>

03:02.291 --> 03:04.259
<i>what you were thinking
when you took this film.</i>

03:04.293 --> 03:06.462
You were probably just sitting
there, just being like...

03:06.495 --> 03:08.397
"Um, excuse me, hold on.

03:08.430 --> 03:11.099
"Now, how can I make
the most amount of money

03:11.132 --> 03:13.302
"while selling out the
most amount of people

03:13.335 --> 03:15.237
<i>"while being
dead-ass terrible?</i>

03:15.270 --> 03:16.904
<i>"How to be terrible?</i>

03:16.938 --> 03:19.241
<i>"How to be terrible?
How to be terrible?"</i>

03:21.377 --> 03:23.512
This motherfucker
need to be checked.

03:23.545 --> 03:24.480
<i>Now, my question is</i>

03:24.513 --> 03:26.482
<i>are you gonna step up
to the challenge</i>

03:26.515 --> 03:28.183
<i>and be who you used to be</i>

03:28.217 --> 03:32.221
<i>that authentic comedian
that we all fell in love with?</i>

03:32.254 --> 03:34.088
<i>That's all I got to say.</i>

03:34.122 --> 03:35.591
This is Deandre McDonald.

03:35.624 --> 03:36.991
<i>And, oh, yeah, baby!</i>

03:37.024 --> 03:41.028
<i>We got millions!
We got millions!</i>

03:41.062 --> 03:43.632
So you think I should
have him killed?

03:43.665 --> 03:47.034
Motherfucker got
over a million followers.

03:47.068 --> 03:50.037
Wouldn't let that nigga
stay alive like that.

03:51.306 --> 03:53.475
Man, if you don't
knock it off...

03:53.509 --> 03:54.976
I'm just
saying.

03:55.009 --> 03:57.646
Black licorice
and peanut butter-mayonnaise

03:57.679 --> 03:59.314
probably got
a million followers.

03:59.348 --> 04:01.483
I got 30 million fans.

04:01.517 --> 04:04.620
Relax. We can't
kill everybody, man.

04:04.653 --> 04:06.622
This tired nigga's
just gotta have cake.

04:07.423 --> 04:08.457
All right.

04:12.059 --> 04:14.028
Yeah, this is
gonna be great. Yeah.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.456
Don't worry.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.592
I'm too tired
to make a move anyway.

04:44.426 --> 04:45.427
Oh.

04:46.228 --> 04:48.630
Don't look at me
like that, okay?

04:48.664 --> 04:50.666
I had to work double
shifts at the hospital...

04:50.699 --> 04:52.201
helped Jaylin
with his homework,

04:52.234 --> 04:54.670
and I studied three hours
for my exam. Yup.

04:54.703 --> 04:57.206
Oh, babe,
you must be exhausted!

04:57.239 --> 04:58.373
- Yes.
- Here.

05:00.409 --> 05:02.344
Let me rub your shoulders.

05:02.377 --> 05:04.111
Okay, that's nice.

05:04.145 --> 05:05.547
It is.

05:05.581 --> 05:09.284
You know, I could get deeper
if you take your shirt off.

05:09.318 --> 05:10.786
- I bet you can.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:10.819 --> 05:13.120
I mean, not that I'm
trying to get you naked...

05:13.154 --> 05:14.656
because you know,
you're exhausted

05:14.690 --> 05:16.391
and that's the last
thing that I want.

05:16.425 --> 05:18.059
- I don't wanna do it.
- Oh, you don't?

05:18.092 --> 05:19.495
Mmm-mmm. Sex?

05:19.528 --> 05:21.463
No! Hell no.

05:21.497 --> 05:22.698
Girl, ew!

05:22.731 --> 05:26.301
Girl, I'm a Christian.
I don't do that.

05:27.469 --> 05:29.136
Now hurry up
and take that shirt off.

05:29.170 --> 05:31.038
So, uh, I can rub down

05:31.072 --> 05:34.776
your soft naked body with this
oil with no ulterior motive.

05:34.810 --> 05:36.378
Dre, this is lube.

05:36.411 --> 05:37.813
Is it?

05:37.846 --> 05:39.414
Oh, my God!

05:39.448 --> 05:41.783
I'm so embarrassed!
Is it the lube?

05:41.817 --> 05:43.452
I'm sorry.
But you know what?

05:43.485 --> 05:44.386
You're crazy.

05:44.419 --> 05:46.321
We might as well
not let it go to waste.

05:46.355 --> 05:48.290
Right? Hmm?

06:12.614 --> 06:14.416
Babe. Babe, wake up.

06:14.449 --> 06:15.517
What?

06:15.551 --> 06:18.220
Babe, wake up. My last video
got over 100,000 hits!

06:18.253 --> 06:19.655
That's so good, babe.

06:19.688 --> 06:21.490
- Don't you wanna see it?
- Yeah.

06:21.523 --> 06:22.791
I'll see it later.

06:22.824 --> 06:26.127
Gotta get up and get Jaylin up
or else we're gonna be late.

06:28.230 --> 06:29.731
Speaking of late...

06:29.765 --> 06:31.533
our rent is late

06:31.567 --> 06:33.067
and very short.

06:34.168 --> 06:35.304
How much?

06:35.337 --> 06:38.206
- Your half.
- Oh.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.375
I'll get that to you today.

06:40.409 --> 06:41.376
Thank you.

06:41.410 --> 06:43.478
Because I cannot cover you
again this month.

06:43.512 --> 06:45.581
I still have to pay
for my nursing exam

06:45.614 --> 06:47.783
and my entire savings is gone.

06:47.816 --> 06:50.352
That's because you're not as
good with money as I am, baby.

06:50.385 --> 06:51.486
Very funny.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.489
- Love you, cutie.
- Love you, too.

06:56.391 --> 06:57.526
Mmm.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.203
$22? Dre, you a loser, man.

07:08.236 --> 07:09.805
What the fuck do you do
with your money?

07:09.838 --> 07:10.872
Well, let's see here.

07:10.906 --> 07:13.775
Food, take care of our
kid, and, oh, yeah...

07:13.809 --> 07:15.344
- eat crack.
- You eat crack?

07:15.377 --> 07:16.378
That's what it is then.

07:16.411 --> 07:18.747
Man, you can't eat crack.
That shit is expensive.

07:18.780 --> 07:21.483
Oh, our rent is expensive
as shit, and it's due ASAP.

07:21.516 --> 07:23.285
Won't even get paid
till next week.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.487
Get an advance.
I do it all the time.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.855
I will say it helps

07:26.888 --> 07:28.757
that Zena don't hate me
as much as she hates you.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.325
Wait, wait, wait.
Zena hates me?

07:30.359 --> 07:31.360
Yeah.

07:35.364 --> 07:36.832
Yeah, she ain't gonna
hook me up with shit.

07:36.865 --> 07:38.734
The worst she can do
is say no, man.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.402
No ain't never hurt
anybody.

07:43.205 --> 07:44.673
Hey, Zena!

07:44.706 --> 07:46.942
Is it possible
if I get a, uh...

07:46.975 --> 07:49.244
Can I get an advance
on my check?

07:49.277 --> 07:50.479
- Maybe...
- Advance?

07:50.512 --> 07:51.546
Boy, hell no.

07:51.580 --> 07:55.217
Your lazy ass, too long of
a lunch break taking,

07:55.250 --> 07:56.885
backwards-ass food stocking,

07:56.918 --> 07:59.588
motherfucker who stepped
on my goddamn toe last week,

07:59.621 --> 08:01.757
and you didn't even say
sorry about that shit!

08:01.790 --> 08:03.725
You know what?
I hope your mother regrets

08:03.759 --> 08:05.427
even having
your monkey ass

08:05.460 --> 08:06.795
and anything
that you put your mind to,

08:06.828 --> 08:08.764
I hope
you fail at it miserably.

08:08.797 --> 08:10.465
Don't ask me for shit.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.533
Move!

08:11.566 --> 08:12.868
<i>Clean up in aisle three.</i>

08:12.901 --> 08:14.336
There's a lot of hurt
in her past.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.304
I thought
that went well. I really did.

08:16.338 --> 08:17.472
Good afternoon, ma'am!
How you doing?

08:17.506 --> 08:18.640
Hey, ma'am!

08:18.674 --> 08:20.242
Would you like
some Port Salut?

08:20.275 --> 08:21.376
Oh, no.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.245
Oh! Wait, I'm sorry.
Do it again.

08:23.278 --> 08:25.313
I wanna get it on the camera,
uh, for his reel.

08:25.347 --> 08:26.448
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah, ask her again.

08:26.481 --> 08:27.749
Do your...

08:27.783 --> 08:30.252
<i>Would you like some cheese?</i>

08:30.285 --> 08:32.953
Cheese, cheese,
cheese plate!

08:32.988 --> 08:35.323
<i>Crackers, we gonna make it
rain crackers</i>

08:35.357 --> 08:37.491
<i>like blessings
from the Lord up in here!</i>

08:37.525 --> 08:38.659
<i>Crackers...</i>

08:38.693 --> 08:39.760
I'm not talking
about white people.

08:39.794 --> 08:40.729
I'm talking about crackers!

08:40.761 --> 08:43.398
<i>That's what we do.
Let's mess up some cheeses.</i>

08:43.432 --> 08:44.666
<i>Let's mess up
some cheeses, yeah.</i>

08:46.535 --> 08:48.003
<i>♪ Gorgonzola, Pepper Jack</i>

08:48.036 --> 08:49.304
<i>♪ Gouda cheese
Yeah, all of that ♪</i>

08:49.337 --> 08:51.573
Uh... Mmm.

08:51.606 --> 08:53.608
No, no, no.
Come here.

08:53.642 --> 08:55.610
Cut out the comedy show

08:55.644 --> 08:57.813
and just sell them cheese,
Deandre.

08:57.846 --> 08:58.947
The problem is,

08:58.980 --> 08:59.948
they don't just
want cheese, huh?

08:59.981 --> 09:02.651
She don't want cheese.
He don't want cheese.

09:02.684 --> 09:04.553
I don't want cheese.
We want respect.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.588
And until I find it,
I ain't gonna stop.

09:06.621 --> 09:07.923
- Oh, Denzel Washington!
- That's right.

09:07.956 --> 09:09.491
- Hey, do something else.
- No, no, no, no!

09:09.524 --> 09:11.393
Go cover my express line.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.994
I don't
wanna cover the express line!

09:13.028 --> 09:14.496
- <i>Oh, Tracy Morgan!</i>
- <i>That's right.</i>

09:14.529 --> 09:17.399
<i>Deandre, go over there now.</i>

09:17.432 --> 09:19.601
<i>Listen, last time I covered
the express line,</i>

09:19.634 --> 09:21.903
<i>ladies came with
100 cans of cat food!</i>

09:21.937 --> 09:23.739
Little lady talking
about some...

09:23.772 --> 09:25.741
"Since it's the same brand,
it only counts as one."

09:25.774 --> 09:27.042
But I was like,
"You know what?

09:27.075 --> 09:29.778
"Fuck that! It doesn't
count as one."

09:29.811 --> 09:31.613
Deandre, you are
pushing it now, okay?

09:31.646 --> 09:32.748
I'm pushing it?
You know what's pushing?

09:32.781 --> 09:33.949
Your hairline!

09:33.982 --> 09:35.517
That's pushing
all the way back!

09:35.550 --> 09:37.319
It's one, two, way back!

09:37.352 --> 09:39.321
- That's what it is.
- Zena's got mad forehead!

09:39.354 --> 09:41.523
You need to stop talking
like Tracy Morgan

09:41.556 --> 09:44.292
and go over there
and do your damn job now.

09:44.326 --> 09:45.927
<i>If I don't
talk like Tracy Morgan,</i>

09:45.961 --> 09:47.395
<i>I'mma talk like Kevin Hart.</i>

09:47.429 --> 09:48.663
<i>Tell you why,
tell you what you did.</i>

09:48.697 --> 09:51.399
<i>It's terrible, disrespectful.
Listen, I'm a human being.</i>

09:51.433 --> 09:53.368
Just because you're a more
handsome man than I am,

09:53.401 --> 09:54.669
strong-ass jawline
and a mustache...

09:54.703 --> 09:55.904
Excuse me.

09:55.937 --> 09:56.972
...that doesn't mean
anything.

09:57.005 --> 09:58.039
Okay, I got you.

09:58.073 --> 09:59.374
You got a mustache.
What you doing?

09:59.407 --> 10:00.842
Say it again.
Say all that shit again.

10:00.876 --> 10:02.644
No, no, no.
I can't even remember now.

10:02.677 --> 10:03.979
The part about
me being a man.

10:04.012 --> 10:05.413
- I said you was a man?
- Yeah.

10:05.447 --> 10:06.782
I might've said that
in character.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.351
It's kind of like I get
possessed by the spirit.

10:09.384 --> 10:10.685
You know what I'm saying?
Like the spirit.

10:10.719 --> 10:12.320
I've been touched by God

10:12.354 --> 10:14.523
and redeemed
by the blood of Jesus!

10:14.556 --> 10:17.859
Hallelujah!

10:17.893 --> 10:19.694
- Lord Jesus!
- Yeah, come here.

10:19.728 --> 10:21.429
You hit like a girl.
That's one redeeming thing.

10:21.463 --> 10:23.431
Yeah, straight up.

10:27.936 --> 10:30.605
Yeah. Need a postcard
for that trip?

10:31.640 --> 10:33.942
- You are so fucking fired!
- I'm fired?

10:33.975 --> 10:35.610
- Yes!
- I'm fired? Thank you!

10:35.644 --> 10:36.978
Who's fired? We're fired?

10:37.012 --> 10:39.648
Fine! Give me the vegetables!
I want this cauliflower.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.749
I'mma take some
squash, take these bananas.

10:40.782 --> 10:42.450
Give me this
God dang apple! Give me it!

10:42.484 --> 10:45.086
We gotta go,
we gotta go, we gotta go!

10:45.120 --> 10:46.321
We out!

10:47.489 --> 10:48.523
Right.

10:53.795 --> 10:55.397
Nice job, Thomas.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.399
Okay, please practice
your sheet music

10:57.432 --> 10:59.501
on your pianos at home. Okay?

10:59.534 --> 11:01.603
What if you
don't have a piano?

11:01.636 --> 11:03.772
Thomas, stop it.

11:03.805 --> 11:06.441
I'm just asking what
Jaylin's supposed to do,

11:06.474 --> 11:07.909
since his family is
too poor to buy one.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.780
That's enough!

11:11.813 --> 11:13.114
Please, be kind.

11:13.148 --> 11:14.716
I will see you all next week.

11:26.094 --> 11:27.362
- Dad!
- Come on.

11:28.430 --> 11:29.464
Oh. Mr. McDonald!

11:31.967 --> 11:35.570
Um, have you made any progress
in getting Jaylin a piano?

11:35.604 --> 11:36.972
- So he could practice?
- Absolutely.

11:37.005 --> 11:38.139
Oh, great!

11:38.173 --> 11:39.541
Yup!

11:39.574 --> 11:40.709
Well, kind of.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.945
I'll figure something out.

11:43.979 --> 11:46.581
You know, you've been
saying that for six months.

11:46.615 --> 11:48.850
Jaylin is starting
to fall behind.

11:48.884 --> 11:51.119
Our lessons are advancing,

11:51.152 --> 11:52.721
and I'm afraid
he's gonna have to

11:52.754 --> 11:54.190
drop the class
until he gets one.

11:54.223 --> 11:57.592
Dad, no! I can't quit piano.

11:57.626 --> 11:59.828
Look, if it's
about the money...

11:59.861 --> 12:01.529
Ain't about
the money, girl.

12:01.563 --> 12:03.565
What you talking about, girl?
We balling around here.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.101
Drip-drop, make it rain
everywhere. Precipitation.

12:06.134 --> 12:07.602
That's right, that's right.

12:07.636 --> 12:09.471
But what if it is
about the money?

12:09.504 --> 12:10.772
I'm sure there's
some music stores

12:10.805 --> 12:12.974
that can extend you credit.

12:13.008 --> 12:15.777
Ain't nobody gonna extend
me no damn credit.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.545
- Credit!
- Crazy!

12:20.216 --> 12:22.117
I just want Jaylin to be able

12:22.150 --> 12:24.119
to better participate
in class.

12:24.152 --> 12:25.887
He just has a lot
of potential.

12:25.921 --> 12:27.822
I agree.

12:27.856 --> 12:30.458
I don't mean
to sound harsh here

12:30.492 --> 12:32.761
but I just would hate
if your life circumstances

12:32.794 --> 12:34.496
would stand in his way.

12:34.996 --> 12:36.531
What?

12:36.898 --> 12:37.899
Lady...

12:38.334 --> 12:40.202
I do for my son.

12:40.236 --> 12:41.102
You feel me?

12:41.136 --> 12:44.639
Oh. No, no, I'm sorry.
I know you can.

12:44.673 --> 12:46.141
- I'm just trying to help.
- Oh, you're trying to help.

12:46.174 --> 12:47.976
Uh, well, you need to
help them bangs

12:48.009 --> 12:49.711
in the front of your face.
That's what you need to do.

12:49.744 --> 12:51.746
- What's wrong with my bang?
- What's wrong with your bang?

12:51.780 --> 12:54.015
It looks like a French horn.

12:54.049 --> 12:55.483
Looking like a broke-ass
Rosie Perez.

12:55.517 --> 12:56.484
Okay.

12:56.518 --> 12:57.852
Looking like
a Puerto Rican version

12:57.886 --> 12:59.854
of Janelle Monae.

13:01.656 --> 13:04.693
Man, fuck Zena,
and fuck that punk-ass job.

13:04.726 --> 13:07.028
I wasn't gonna blow up
working at no grocery store.

13:07.062 --> 13:09.664
Now I got more time to devote
to my comedy. Yes!

13:09.698 --> 13:12.100
Okay. Dre, this shit is about
to crack for the both of us.

13:12.133 --> 13:14.002
I want you to see this.

13:14.035 --> 13:15.837
I just submitted
your audition tape

13:15.870 --> 13:18.274
and Instagram videos
to this showcase.

13:18.307 --> 13:19.774
Boom. Come on!

13:19.808 --> 13:20.909
Good shit, my G.

13:20.942 --> 13:22.043
It is your time, man.

13:22.077 --> 13:24.180
I got a feeling
about this, Dre!

13:24.213 --> 13:26.614
You gonna win this thing, man.
You hear me?

13:26.648 --> 13:28.850
You are going to win this
and when you do,

13:28.883 --> 13:29.918
you gonna go on tour.

13:29.951 --> 13:32.087
Then your stand-up, that's
gonna lead to acting.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.689
Then we gonna parlay that
into an action movie career.

13:34.723 --> 13:36.024
I'mma represent you,

13:36.057 --> 13:37.726
and then I'mma open up
a big-ass management firm.

13:37.759 --> 13:39.195
Guess who I'm gonna sign?

13:39.228 --> 13:41.730
Sarah Silverman. Make her have
my little black baby.

13:41.763 --> 13:43.098
Boom.

13:43.131 --> 13:45.734
Dre, you are exactly
what they're looking for.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.535
You exactly
what I'm looking for, too.

13:47.569 --> 13:48.603
- Hey!
- Oh, hey!

13:49.637 --> 13:51.006
Oh, wow! Okay.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.141
Look at this. This right here,
you know what this is?

13:53.174 --> 13:55.710
This is black love.
I love that.

13:55.744 --> 13:58.013
Feel like I shouldn't
even be here. Goddamn.

13:58.414 --> 13:59.714
You shouldn't.

13:59.748 --> 14:01.217
You just gonna do me
like that?

14:01.250 --> 14:02.684
Eddie just submitted me
for this

14:02.717 --> 14:04.953
Laugh Out Loud
comedy showcase.

14:04.986 --> 14:07.189
So, uh, they're looking
for the next big thing...

14:07.223 --> 14:08.623
and it's me.

14:08.656 --> 14:10.058
Shit, it better be you.

14:10.091 --> 14:11.626
You know
you ain't got no job.

14:12.093 --> 14:13.928
What?

14:13.962 --> 14:15.697
- What is he talking about?
- Oh, shit!

14:16.031 --> 14:17.299
Huh?

14:17.333 --> 14:19.768
That's on me.
That is my bad.

14:19.801 --> 14:21.870
- You lost your job?
- I'm sorry, dawg.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.973
Yeah, but look, babe.
Come on, you know me, babe.

14:25.006 --> 14:27.243
I'll figure something out.
It's all good.

14:27.276 --> 14:29.211
Listen, that job was
for suckers anyway.

14:29.245 --> 14:31.012
I need to be focused
on my comedy,

14:31.046 --> 14:32.614
building all my numbers
on the socials.

14:32.647 --> 14:35.650
We need rent money, okay?

14:35.683 --> 14:38.019
And followers don't pay!
You sound crazy.

14:38.053 --> 14:40.622
Sometimes, they do.
Not to cut you off.

14:40.655 --> 14:42.090
But you just gotta get
brand sponsorship.

14:42.123 --> 14:43.225
Like the Kardashians, right?

14:43.259 --> 14:44.326
- They make six...
- Okay!

14:44.360 --> 14:46.928
But does he have
a brand sponsorship?

14:46.961 --> 14:48.330
Mmm, no, he does not.

14:48.364 --> 14:49.864
Because you didn't
get him one.

14:49.898 --> 14:51.733
You been managing him
for what?

14:51.766 --> 14:53.335
- Three years now?
- Like two and a half.

14:53.369 --> 14:55.136
And you really
ain't did shit.

14:55.170 --> 14:56.738
But then again,
why would you be able to get

14:56.771 --> 14:58.240
his career cracking
when you...

14:58.274 --> 15:00.108
Whoa, wait, don't say anything
that you can't take back, Sky.

15:00.141 --> 15:01.310
...live with your mama!

15:01.343 --> 15:02.977
Oh, shit. You just went there.

15:03.011 --> 15:04.045
- Yeah.
- You just went there

15:04.079 --> 15:05.214
- like that, huh?
- Yeah.

15:05.247 --> 15:07.082
You said you would never
bring that up, Sky.

15:07.115 --> 15:07.982
I lied.

15:08.016 --> 15:09.684
Sky, listen,
stop tripping.

15:09.717 --> 15:10.952
I'll figure something out.

15:10.985 --> 15:12.954
A few months ago, you figured
out you were gonna make money

15:12.987 --> 15:14.823
by putting ads
on your website.

15:14.856 --> 15:16.091
- Yup.
- Did that pay?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.193
Yes, it did.

15:17.226 --> 15:18.726
Google AdSense
is a great way

15:18.760 --> 15:20.829
to monetize
your online content.

15:20.862 --> 15:21.896
So, yeah.

15:21.930 --> 15:23.399
How much did you make?

15:23.432 --> 15:26.734
- Uh... In the last 30 days?
- Sure.

15:26.768 --> 15:28.736
If you carry over the one,

15:28.770 --> 15:29.904
carry over the twos,
30 days...

15:29.938 --> 15:31.940
That's gonna be,
for the April...

15:31.973 --> 15:34.310
- How much, Dre?
- Okay, up to...

15:35.844 --> 15:37.313
Six dollars.

15:37.346 --> 15:39.948
And a little extra.
Babe, babe, it's all good.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.218
I can't keep doing this.

15:42.251 --> 15:44.652
I work hard
and I hold us down.

15:44.686 --> 15:46.754
But you, you just do
whatever you want.

15:46.788 --> 15:48.424
I'm not doing
whatever I want.

15:48.457 --> 15:49.958
I'm following my dreams.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.159
You have a family.

15:51.193 --> 15:54.662
No job, no money,
and you rent a house.

15:54.696 --> 15:56.798
At a certain point,
following your dreams

15:56.831 --> 15:58.367
is irresponsible, Dre.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.135
And I have to be honest...

16:00.168 --> 16:01.736
I'm tired.

16:03.372 --> 16:04.973
- Ooh.
- Sky.

16:08.042 --> 16:09.378
Now, maybe, just maybe,

16:09.411 --> 16:11.012
when she says she's tired,

16:11.045 --> 16:12.881
she means it
in a different way.

16:16.017 --> 16:16.851
Nope.

16:16.885 --> 16:18.820
You got a big
fucking mouth, Eddie.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.722
I know. It just slipped out
'cause I was...

16:25.760 --> 16:27.028
Hey, you up last, baby.

16:27.061 --> 16:28.163
I bet.

16:30.266 --> 16:32.434
- Can I ask you a question?
- What's up?

16:32.468 --> 16:34.702
Why you always writing
in this?

16:34.736 --> 16:36.871
Like, what is this book?

16:36.905 --> 16:38.207
I'm journaling, fool.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.707
- You're journaling?
- Yeah!

16:39.741 --> 16:40.875
- You're journaling?
- It helps me process

16:40.909 --> 16:42.110
what I feel about life.

16:42.143 --> 16:44.145
My shit is so fucked up
right now,

16:44.180 --> 16:45.713
I need to channel it
somewhere.

16:45.747 --> 16:47.982
So until I can pay
an uptight white lady

16:48.016 --> 16:49.218
to listen to my problems,

16:49.251 --> 16:51.152
I'mma put it all down
right here.

16:51.187 --> 16:52.221
Okay.

16:52.254 --> 16:53.322
You should try it.

16:53.355 --> 16:55.123
Me? I should try journaling?

16:55.156 --> 16:57.792
Yeah, everybody has something
they need to work out.

16:57.825 --> 16:59.461
Get the fuck out! I ain't
got shit I need to work out.

16:59.495 --> 17:00.862
You wanna know why?

17:00.895 --> 17:02.163
I keep all my
shit up top, Dre.

17:02.198 --> 17:04.300
I let everybody know
how I feel.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.166
- Uh-huh.
- Everybody.

17:06.202 --> 17:08.069
Except maybe my daddy.

17:08.102 --> 17:09.405
'Cause I never really
could talk to the man.

17:09.438 --> 17:10.573
And you know what's funny?

17:10.606 --> 17:13.775
No matter how curious I was
to learn things about him,

17:13.808 --> 17:15.310
he was never comfortable
sharing with me.

17:15.344 --> 17:16.978
So, then I'm like,
"What is it about me?"

17:17.413 --> 17:19.146
Like I said.

17:20.982 --> 17:22.150
Fuck you.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.154
<i>This cop has never
seen shit like this.</i>

17:26.188 --> 17:28.424
<i>Not a .08, not a .10.</i>

17:28.457 --> 17:30.825
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I blew a 3.7!</i>

17:31.493 --> 17:33.094
<i>That's a goddamn GPA.</i>

17:33.127 --> 17:34.796
<i>You understand that?</i>

17:34.829 --> 17:36.965
<i>I got a DUI
and a scholarship!</i>

17:37.865 --> 17:39.067
<i>I'm killing in this bitch!</i>

17:39.100 --> 17:40.302
<i>I'm killing in this bitch!</i>

17:41.803 --> 17:43.472
<i>Y'all ready
to get this show rolling?</i>

17:47.909 --> 17:49.345
<i>Last up for the night...</i>

17:49.378 --> 17:51.247
<i>Dre, just get up here.</i>

17:51.280 --> 17:53.014
Yeah!

17:53.047 --> 17:54.350
Go kill it. Go do you.

17:54.383 --> 17:56.918
- I will, I will. I got you.
- Kill it, baby.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.886
Listen, it's 1:00 a.m.

17:59.388 --> 18:01.190
It's tomorrow.

18:01.223 --> 18:03.325
- Get this shit over with.
- Yeah.

18:06.828 --> 18:08.230
<i>What up?</i>

18:08.264 --> 18:09.431
Get 'em, Dre!

18:09.465 --> 18:11.500
<i>Give it up for the ladies.</i>

18:11.533 --> 18:13.167
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

18:13.202 --> 18:15.304
<i>That's... Yeah!</i>

18:15.337 --> 18:17.038
<i>You know what's crazy?
You know what would be crazy?</i>

18:17.071 --> 18:19.408
<i>Fucking Jay-Z at a
motherfucking McDonald's.</i>

18:19.441 --> 18:20.609
<i>That shit would
be crazy as shit.</i>

18:20.643 --> 18:22.578
<i>Hey, yo, can I
please get an apple pie?</i>

18:22.611 --> 18:24.313
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:24.346 --> 18:26.382
<i>I want an apple pie
and a large fry.</i>

18:26.415 --> 18:27.982
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:28.016 --> 18:29.251
<i>Shyeah.</i>

18:29.285 --> 18:32.020
<i>I love Oreos, yeah.</i>

18:32.053 --> 18:33.121
<i>It's a flurry.</i>

19:02.618 --> 19:04.018
Yeah.

19:04.052 --> 19:06.154
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:30.945 --> 19:31.946
Dad?

19:35.417 --> 19:37.118
Go back to sleep, buddy.

19:39.188 --> 19:40.389
What is that?

19:41.523 --> 19:42.924
A piano?

19:42.957 --> 19:44.259
Yeah.

19:44.293 --> 19:47.629
Well, you know,
it's not the real thing.

19:47.663 --> 19:49.665
Duh, Dad. It says
Charmin on the side.

19:49.698 --> 19:52.434
This is so dope.

19:54.503 --> 19:55.937
Look, it's temporary,
you know.

19:55.970 --> 19:57.473
I know you've been
falling behind in class

19:57.506 --> 19:59.173
'cause you haven't
been able to practice.

20:00.409 --> 20:02.910
I figure at least
you can practice

20:02.944 --> 20:05.247
finger positioning
and building chords.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.014
This is perfect.

20:08.015 --> 20:09.518
Hey. Hey.

20:09.551 --> 20:10.918
Don't get used to it,
all right?

20:10.952 --> 20:12.053
All right.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.490
Look, I'mma get you
something dope.

20:14.523 --> 20:16.023
Believe that.

20:16.057 --> 20:18.059
- I just gotta...
- I know.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.228
Figure something out.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.263
I say that a lot, don't I?

20:21.296 --> 20:22.464
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:22.498 --> 20:23.965
Well, I mean it.

20:25.066 --> 20:26.368
- All right now?
- All right.

20:26.402 --> 20:27.469
You're gonna be
like a little Mozart,

20:27.503 --> 20:28.570
a little Amadeus.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.705
That's what
they gonna call you.

20:29.738 --> 20:31.306
Get excited, all right?

20:31.340 --> 20:33.174
- Game time. Say "Game time!"
- Game time.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.041
- Game time.
- Game time.

20:34.075 --> 20:35.344
That's right.
Stick your chest out!

20:35.377 --> 20:36.712
Stick your chest out
like this.

20:36.745 --> 20:38.514
- Game time.
- There you go! There you go!

20:38.547 --> 20:39.681
All right.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.294
Morning, family!

20:52.327 --> 20:54.196
What up, boy?

20:54.730 --> 20:56.030
You good, baby?

20:56.063 --> 20:57.098
I'm fine.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.166
Good. Me, too.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.034
Ooh, we got pancakes, huh?

21:00.067 --> 21:01.303
Special occasion?

21:01.336 --> 21:04.071
Well, my little guy here's
been working so hard in school.

21:04.105 --> 21:07.975
And when people work hard,
they deserve pancakes.

21:08.009 --> 21:10.044
So cute!

21:10.077 --> 21:11.180
Great!

21:11.213 --> 21:12.314
Can I have a pancake?

21:12.347 --> 21:13.981
There's none left.

21:14.015 --> 21:15.384
But there's
a stack right...

21:16.552 --> 21:18.119
These are mine.

21:20.054 --> 21:21.757
You know, uh...

21:21.790 --> 21:23.625
I'm starting to feel like
you just made pancakes

21:23.659 --> 21:25.594
to make it a point to
not give me pancakes.

21:25.627 --> 21:27.196
Is that what's happening?

21:31.667 --> 21:33.469
Got a lot of malice
in your walk there.

21:34.403 --> 21:36.103
Boy...

21:36.137 --> 21:38.540
if I don't teach you anything
else, you just remember...

21:38.574 --> 21:42.009
when a woman says she's
fine, don't believe it.

21:42.043 --> 21:43.745
All right. What'd you do?

21:43.779 --> 21:45.380
Come on, Jaylin,
so I can get you to school,

21:45.414 --> 21:48.550
before I go to work
at the job that I have.

21:50.752 --> 21:53.655
Looks like it has something
to do with the job.

21:53.689 --> 21:55.457
What?
Just get your book bag.

21:55.491 --> 21:57.493
All right. Just saying.

21:59.126 --> 22:00.127
Enjoy.

22:01.763 --> 22:03.532
You ain't even gonna
crack it though?

22:05.099 --> 22:08.035
So, while I'm at
my occupation...

22:08.069 --> 22:09.505
what will you
be doing all day?

22:09.538 --> 22:11.273
Oh, well, writing jokes.

22:11.306 --> 22:12.808
Oh, I got this new idea
for a comedy video,

22:12.841 --> 22:14.610
so I'mma go ahead
and produce that.

22:14.643 --> 22:16.211
So, you just gonna
be sitting at home,

22:16.245 --> 22:17.679
writing jokes...

22:17.713 --> 22:19.248
doing comedy all day?

22:19.281 --> 22:20.616
That's nice. That's good.

22:22.751 --> 22:25.152
- Sky, why you gotta...
- Dre, Dre, Dre!

22:25.187 --> 22:27.054
You got into
the LOL showcase.

22:27.088 --> 22:29.224
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Just slow down. Get it out.

22:29.258 --> 22:30.392
You got into the LOL showcase.

22:30.425 --> 22:31.660
What?

22:31.693 --> 22:33.662
Hey, hey, takeoff,
I can't understand what you're saying.

22:33.695 --> 22:37.299
I said, Dre, you got into
the Laugh Out Loud showcase.

22:37.332 --> 22:38.400
- What?
- Yes!

22:38.433 --> 22:39.401
I'm going to LA?

22:39.434 --> 22:41.737
Well, we going to LA, man.
All expenses paid!

22:41.770 --> 22:43.372
Air, hotel, rental car.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.773
And I ain't talking about,
like, the little economy.

22:44.806 --> 22:47.442
I'm talking about the SUV,
minivan, 4x4 category...

22:47.476 --> 22:48.577
'cause they classy, Dre!

22:48.610 --> 22:49.745
The seat's first class?
They gonna recline

22:49.778 --> 22:51.179
all the way back
like this here?

22:51.213 --> 22:52.681
Recline, dawg, like that!

22:52.714 --> 22:53.749
Baby!

22:53.782 --> 22:55.317
That's great.

22:55.350 --> 22:56.785
That's great.

22:56.818 --> 23:00.087
Just lost my appetite,
but that's great.

23:01.823 --> 23:05.227
Hold on. Hey.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.261
Ooh, pancakes!

23:07.896 --> 23:09.431
Sky, why you hating?

23:09.464 --> 23:11.333
I'm not.
I'm happy for you.

23:11.366 --> 23:13.167
Well, it doesn't
seem like it.

23:13.201 --> 23:14.570
Dre.

23:14.603 --> 23:16.438
You always do
some big audition

23:16.471 --> 23:17.839
or get props
on social media

23:17.873 --> 23:19.106
and think it'
your big break.

23:19.140 --> 23:21.577
We get all worked up thinking
it's gonna change our lives

23:21.610 --> 23:22.511
and then nothing.

23:22.544 --> 23:25.213
But it's different this
time. It's Cali.

23:25.247 --> 23:28.183
- Cali, Sky. Cali.
- Maybe.

23:29.651 --> 23:32.187
Or maybe the time spent
there chasing your dreams

23:32.220 --> 23:34.690
is better off spent here
chasing a paycheck.

23:34.723 --> 23:36.892
So what am I supposed to do?
I'm supposed to just stay here

23:36.925 --> 23:40.161
and be a regular-ass guy
with a regular-ass job?

23:40.195 --> 23:41.530
Not regular.

23:42.397 --> 23:43.699
Reliable.

23:45.233 --> 23:46.335
- See you tonight.
- Sky.

23:46.368 --> 23:47.469
- Come on, Jaylin.
- Baby.

23:54.409 --> 23:55.777
I'm proud of you, Dad.

23:56.745 --> 23:58.112
Thanks, bud.

24:01.316 --> 24:02.718
I can't go.

24:02.751 --> 24:04.720
Bullshit! You gotta go.

24:04.753 --> 24:06.355
- I can't, man.
- You gotta go, Dre.

24:06.388 --> 24:08.857
No, no, no. I'm on thin ice
with her right now, man.

24:08.890 --> 24:10.626
- I can't leave.
- I get it, man.

24:10.659 --> 24:12.227
You are afraid that somebody

24:12.260 --> 24:13.562
gonna hit that
while you gone.

24:13.595 --> 24:14.763
Because, yes, tired women,

24:14.796 --> 24:17.332
they are very vulnerable to
random dick. This is true.

24:17.366 --> 24:18.834
Well, I wasn't thinking
about that,

24:18.867 --> 24:20.302
but thanks for
putting it in my head.

24:20.335 --> 24:21.803
Dre, you know
why you gotta go?

24:21.837 --> 24:22.771
Because if you don't,

24:22.804 --> 24:24.740
you will resent Sky
for holding you back.

24:24.773 --> 24:26.742
Next thing you know,
you a old-ass man,

24:26.775 --> 24:29.277
a janitor at a fucking
elementary school,

24:29.311 --> 24:30.545
doing jokes for kids.

24:30.579 --> 24:31.680
Or worse.

24:31.713 --> 24:33.815
Or worse, I could be
security at the rec center.

24:33.849 --> 24:34.816
Oh, my God!
Dre, that's even...

24:34.850 --> 24:35.951
Oh, my God!
I'd be talking about some...

24:35.984 --> 24:37.853
Putting the basketballs away.

24:37.886 --> 24:39.421
Put the basketballs away!

24:39.454 --> 24:41.423
And for what?
We ain't gonna do nothing but take

24:41.456 --> 24:43.225
the balls back out
and play ball with them.

24:43.258 --> 24:44.559
- That's right.
- It's fucking bullshit!

24:44.593 --> 24:46.194
It will be bad for me.

24:46.228 --> 24:47.763
Hey, you know what?

24:47.796 --> 24:49.931
And Sky wouldn't want me
to live being unhappy.

24:49.965 --> 24:51.199
Come on,
you are saving her

24:51.233 --> 24:52.434
from a lifetime
with a bitter man

24:52.467 --> 24:53.935
who blames her
for his failures.

24:53.969 --> 24:55.237
I can't let her
live like that.

24:55.270 --> 24:56.304
Hell no, you can't.

24:56.338 --> 24:58.340
You gotta do what the fuck
you wanna do for her.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.741
You know what? Forget it!

24:59.775 --> 25:01.343
- We going to Cali!
- Hell yeah, we going to Cali!

25:01.376 --> 25:03.412
- We going to Cali! We going!
- We going to LA, baby!

25:03.445 --> 25:05.280
- We going to the west side!
- We going to the west side!

25:05.313 --> 25:06.715
The west side is the best
side, motherfucker!

25:06.748 --> 25:10.252
Yes! Maybe we'll tone down some of that.
You know what I'm saying?

25:10.285 --> 25:11.653
'Cause we don't wanna scare
'em when we get on the plane

25:11.687 --> 25:13.355
with the Tupac, right?

25:13.388 --> 25:14.423
- Give me that goddamn pancake.
- Just gonna take the pancake?

25:14.456 --> 25:15.957
Here, you take this
right here. Yes.

25:15.991 --> 25:17.459
- Give me the fucking egg?
- Yes!

25:18.527 --> 25:20.262
Oh! God!

25:25.467 --> 25:27.769
Well, this is it.

25:27.803 --> 25:28.870
Wish me luck.

25:28.904 --> 25:30.238
Go win, Dad!

25:31.707 --> 25:33.208
Yeah. Oh!

25:34.710 --> 25:36.411
Got you something.

25:36.445 --> 25:37.546
What's this?

25:37.579 --> 25:39.247
That's my half of the rent.

25:39.281 --> 25:40.549
You know, plus a little more.

25:41.016 --> 25:42.217
Thanks.

25:44.486 --> 25:46.488
Sky, come on.

25:46.521 --> 25:47.956
I gotta do this.

25:47.989 --> 25:50.425
I wouldn't be the man you
love if I stayed.

25:51.727 --> 25:53.528
I don't know if the
man I love would leave.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.048
It's Cali, bitch!

26:13.081 --> 26:15.283
We in Cali, bitch!

26:16.651 --> 26:18.053
Whoo!

26:18.086 --> 26:19.921
What's up?
You feel me?

26:24.693 --> 26:25.794
We in there, baby. Hold on.

26:25.827 --> 26:27.896
Can I get in there?

26:29.631 --> 26:30.665
Boom! Kill it!

26:35.971 --> 26:37.072
What up, Sky?

26:39.374 --> 26:40.209
<i>Fuck we at?</i>

26:40.243 --> 26:41.476
Man, don't cuss, man!
It's my mama!

26:41.510 --> 26:42.811
- Oh, my bad!
- This is my mama.

26:48.683 --> 26:49.818
Welcome to the hotel, sir.

27:04.699 --> 27:06.968
- Oh, okay! You know what?
- God dang!

27:07.002 --> 27:09.704
We ain't even gonna trip.
We ain't even out here for that.

27:09.738 --> 27:11.506
- Hello. How you doing?
- Hi. Good.

27:11.540 --> 27:12.607
Checking in.

27:12.641 --> 27:13.675
Name on the reservation,
please.

27:13.708 --> 27:15.577
Sure, it's Deandre McDonald.

27:17.712 --> 27:18.613
My boy.

27:18.647 --> 27:19.915
It's not showing your name
in our system.

27:19.948 --> 27:20.816
Really?

27:20.849 --> 27:22.450
That's so weird.
It's totally in there.

27:22.484 --> 27:23.585
Why don't you just
check again for me, okay?

27:23.618 --> 27:24.653
Thank you.

27:24.686 --> 27:25.787
Dre, you know what I hope?

27:25.821 --> 27:26.955
I hope there's
a spa credit, man.

27:26.988 --> 27:28.023
I want a massage.

27:28.056 --> 27:29.457
I never had
a real massage, man.

27:29.491 --> 27:30.792
- Yeah.
- I wanna get a Swedish...

27:30.826 --> 27:32.127
I'm sorry,
it's not in our computer.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.096
Maybe your reservation's
at another hotel.

27:35.130 --> 27:37.866
Why would the reservation
be at another hotel?

27:38.767 --> 27:40.035
Oh...

27:40.068 --> 27:42.103
- Okay, I see what's going on.
- Ed, I...

27:42.137 --> 27:43.505
No, I see what's going on.
It's all good.

27:43.538 --> 27:44.940
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

27:44.973 --> 27:46.775
Yeah, this right here, this is,
like, classic racial discrimination.

27:46.808 --> 27:47.742
Hey, hey, hey!
Hold on, man!

27:47.776 --> 27:48.610
You see me and my boy.
Hold on, I got this.

27:48.643 --> 27:50.045
You see me and my boy
come in here.

27:50.078 --> 27:51.012
We got a little melanin
in our skin.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.614
Now, all of a sudden,
y'all wanna lose...

27:52.647 --> 27:54.382
Hi. Reservation for
Carl Johnson.

27:54.416 --> 27:55.717
Welcome back, Mr. Johnson.

27:55.750 --> 27:58.954
Yes, I have your room
right here

27:58.987 --> 28:01.389
and it's a pleasure
having you stay with us.

28:01.423 --> 28:02.424
Thank you.

28:04.426 --> 28:05.560
But he's mixed.

28:05.594 --> 28:07.629
Are you mixed?
Excuse me, are you mixed?

28:07.662 --> 28:09.464
Sir? A little?

28:09.497 --> 28:12.434
A quarter Cherokee
or something?

28:12.467 --> 28:14.069
Mixed at all? No? Really?

28:14.102 --> 28:15.637
He's mixed.
He's totally mixed. What?

28:15.670 --> 28:16.938
He's black as shit.
Come on.

28:16.972 --> 28:18.274
Come here.
I need to talk to you.

28:18.307 --> 28:19.908
Can you give me just one second?
Thank you. I appreciate it.

28:19.941 --> 28:20.976
What?

28:21.009 --> 28:22.677
I'm trying to
work this out.

28:22.711 --> 28:24.145
Yeah, but we don't have
a reservation.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.847
- Who don't have a reservation?
- We don't!

28:25.881 --> 28:27.082
- Yes, we do!
- No, we don't!

28:27.115 --> 28:28.450
Why don't we have
a reservation, Dre?

28:28.483 --> 28:29.985
- 'Cause I sold it.
- You sold...

28:30.018 --> 28:31.453
Shh!

28:31.486 --> 28:33.455
Sorry, just real quick.

28:33.488 --> 28:34.723
Why would you sell
our reservation?

28:34.756 --> 28:36.458
- For rent money, man.
- Okay.

28:36.491 --> 28:39.027
Okay. Okay. So this isn't
racial discrimination?

28:39.060 --> 28:40.762
No, no, no. It ain't
racial discrimination.

28:40.795 --> 28:42.564
This is just a total fuck-up.
We ain't even staying here.

28:42.597 --> 28:43.665
Okay, all right.

28:43.698 --> 28:44.699
Hey!

28:45.634 --> 28:47.068
Um...

28:47.102 --> 28:48.970
- You having a good day?
- Great.

28:49.004 --> 28:50.438
Great. Good, good.
What's your name?

28:50.472 --> 28:52.440
- Tiffany.
- Tiffany!

28:52.474 --> 28:53.608
Um, here's the thing, Tiffany.

28:53.642 --> 28:56.077
As a black man in America,

28:56.111 --> 28:59.447
I tend to experience
racial discrimination

28:59.481 --> 29:00.383
at, say,
a higher rate than, say,

29:00.415 --> 29:01.483
someone like you.
You know what I mean?

29:01.516 --> 29:02.751
You got your blue eyes,
you got your blonde hair.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.921
When's the last time you was,
like, discriminated against?

29:06.855 --> 29:09.057
Besides right now?

29:09.090 --> 29:10.892
You think I'm
discriminating?

29:13.828 --> 29:14.863
God!

29:14.896 --> 29:17.632
Dre, you had so many
opportunities to tell me!

29:17.666 --> 29:18.833
You could've told me
at the airport.

29:18.867 --> 29:20.168
You could've told me
on the plane.

29:20.202 --> 29:21.569
You could've told me
when I was planning

29:21.603 --> 29:22.804
my little bubble bath
and Jacuzzi!

29:22.837 --> 29:24.539
Hey, I'm sorry!

29:24.572 --> 29:26.741
Where we gonna stay, Dre? Hmm?

29:26.775 --> 29:28.076
Man, look.
I don't know, man.

29:28.109 --> 29:30.545
I gave the rest
of the money to Sky.

29:30.578 --> 29:31.913
Well, I spent all my money
on these Jordans.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.383
Don't look at me
like that, Dre.

29:34.417 --> 29:37.585
How am I gonna pull a fancy
client wearing some ASICS?

29:37.619 --> 29:39.154
I can't wear no ASICS!

29:39.188 --> 29:41.957
That's when you go online, and you go
to one of those Chinese online things,

29:41.990 --> 29:43.925
and you get yourself
some knockoff Jordans!

29:43.959 --> 29:45.126
- You know what I'm saying?
- No, I don't.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.729
With one of the little fat
niggas on the side like this.

29:47.762 --> 29:48.763
That's what you get.

29:49.731 --> 29:51.499
Don't make me
laugh right now.

29:51.533 --> 29:53.568
- But you wanna laugh though.
- No, I wanna sleep right now.

29:53.601 --> 29:55.503
I wanna get a massage right now.
That's what I wanna do.

29:55.537 --> 29:56.604
But that's hilarious.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.674
- That's so funny.
- Ah, uh, ah!

29:59.708 --> 30:01.142
You smiling, you smiling!

30:01.177 --> 30:02.844
No, no, no. Don't dap me.

30:02.877 --> 30:05.013
This is not
a dap moment, at all.

30:08.783 --> 30:11.987
Technically, all we need
is a roof over our heads.

30:12.020 --> 30:14.022
Dre, you gonna make me
live in a car?

30:14.055 --> 30:16.091
It's free.

30:16.124 --> 30:17.959
"It's free! It's free, man!"

30:25.201 --> 30:27.168
Marq, you ain't
gonna believe this.

30:27.203 --> 30:28.536
Deandre McDonald is out here

30:28.570 --> 30:29.771
for that
Laugh Out Loud showcase.

30:29.804 --> 30:31.606
And who is Deandre McDonald?

30:32.040 --> 30:33.608
Nobody.

30:33.641 --> 30:35.643
Nah, he's the influencer
that made that video

30:35.677 --> 30:38.280
dissing you and
<i>The Secret Service Man.</i>

30:38.314 --> 30:40.081
Uncle Nico,
I'm just trying to remind him...

30:40.115 --> 30:42.117
about the dude that was
talking shit about his movies.

30:42.150 --> 30:43.219
You remember.

30:43.252 --> 30:45.687
He said they was trash,
they was ass.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.921
I was watching it
this morning.

30:46.955 --> 30:48.056
What's your email?
I'mma send it to you.

30:48.089 --> 30:49.024
Let me send it to you.

30:49.057 --> 30:51.726
Jethro, get your ratchet
away from my feathers.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.061
These are real feathers.

30:53.094 --> 30:55.563
And why is your name
Jethro, anyway?

30:55.597 --> 30:56.798
You're not a slave.

30:56.831 --> 30:58.033
It was my granddaddy name.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.567
He was gonna give it
to my uncle,

30:59.601 --> 31:01.836
but he gave it to my
auntie, and then she...

31:01.870 --> 31:03.171
Y'all want something
from craft service?

31:03.205 --> 31:04.340
We want you
to get out of here.

31:04.373 --> 31:06.674
I'mma get him some sunflower
seeds since he a bird.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.714
Like I give a fuck about

31:12.747 --> 31:16.084
what some internet
motherfucker say about me!

31:16.117 --> 31:17.520
Sitting back there, judging.

31:17.552 --> 31:20.655
How many views he got on that
<i>Secret Service Man</i> thing anyway?

31:20.688 --> 31:22.624
Like barely any.

31:22.657 --> 31:23.758
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

31:23.792 --> 31:25.894
<i>That's what I thought.
How many?</i>

31:28.029 --> 31:29.798
Like one...

31:31.267 --> 31:33.034
million...

31:33.068 --> 31:34.769
two hundred and forty...

31:35.337 --> 31:36.671
and five...

31:37.705 --> 31:38.807
thousand.

31:39.341 --> 31:40.376
That's a lot.

31:40.409 --> 31:42.143
- Is it?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:42.178 --> 31:43.611
Really?

31:44.879 --> 31:46.981
Look, I don't
care about him.

31:47.015 --> 31:49.050
I'm sure my fans
don't care about him.

31:49.084 --> 31:51.152
They don't.
They never have.

31:51.187 --> 31:53.121
He does a good impression
of you, though.

31:53.154 --> 31:55.056
Does he really?

31:55.090 --> 31:57.959
Good. I'mma do a good impression of him.
Here it goes.

31:57.992 --> 31:59.295
Deandre McDonald.

32:00.929 --> 32:03.232
See that?

32:03.265 --> 32:05.733
Wasn't shit.
'Cause he ain't shit.

32:05.767 --> 32:07.135
He's a nobody.

32:07.168 --> 32:08.636
Can't do an
impression of him.

32:08.670 --> 32:11.106
You do an almost impression.

32:11.139 --> 32:12.841
That was almost him
right there.

32:14.310 --> 32:16.878
There he almost go again.

32:16.911 --> 32:18.079
Nothing after nothing.

32:18.113 --> 32:20.216
Do it one more time.

32:20.249 --> 32:22.251
There he is again.
You see him?

32:24.719 --> 32:27.389
Wish I could make a living
doing Deandre McDonald.

32:29.023 --> 32:30.058
Again!

32:31.693 --> 32:33.161
He's a weak-ass...

32:33.195 --> 32:35.830
- <i>fake-ass wannabe comedian.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

32:35.864 --> 32:37.665
- <i>And I'm the real thing.</i>
- <i>Yes, you are.</i>

32:37.699 --> 32:39.134
<i>Original.</i>

32:39.167 --> 32:42.003
You understand the words
coming out of my beak?

32:42.036 --> 32:44.340
<i>Deandre McDonald is nothing.</i>

32:44.373 --> 32:45.740
Ghetto bird.

32:45.773 --> 32:46.975
Ain't got no time
to be worried about him.

32:47.008 --> 32:49.378
He'll never be the big bird
on the block, ya underdig me?

32:50.179 --> 32:51.646
- Never.
- Never.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.188
<i>They say black people don't snitch.
Shit, I snitched!</i>

32:59.221 --> 33:02.123
<i>I've been a snitch since
I've been 12 years old.</i>

33:02.157 --> 33:04.792
<i>I remember my mother came
home from work one day...</i>

33:04.826 --> 33:06.295
<i>and she told me and my
brother and my sister,</i>

33:06.328 --> 33:08.029
<i>"I'mma whoop
everybody ass in here</i>

33:08.062 --> 33:10.399
<i>"till somebody tell me
who broke my lamp!"</i>

33:10.432 --> 33:11.900
<i>I looked her
straight in her face,</i>

33:11.933 --> 33:13.302
<i>"Then no need to hit me.</i>

33:15.404 --> 33:17.872
<i>"Matter of fact, grab that belt
and meet me in the kitchen."</i>

33:19.073 --> 33:20.476
<i>I go, "Shit, I'm about
to tell you!</i>

33:20.509 --> 33:22.143
<i>"You gonna cook me
something to eat!"</i>

33:23.345 --> 33:25.914
<i>Are y'all ready
to continue this show?</i>

33:25.947 --> 33:29.083
<i>Welcome to the Laugh Out Loud
Comedy Showcase.</i>

<i>One of these comedians

<i>Hey! What's up, y'all?</i>

<i>Yeah, please vote for me</i>

33:53.942 --> 33:55.177

33:56.245 --> 33:58.913
<i>You can tell when a friend

<i>when they start
asking you stuff like,</i>

34:00.516 --> 34:02.384
<i>"Um, you wanna

34:02.418 --> 34:04.152
<i>You be like,
"A shot of what?"</i>

34:04.186 --> 34:06.087
<i>He like,
"Patron and Hennessy."</i>

34:06.921 --> 34:08.224
<i>"Together?"</i>

34:08.257 --> 34:10.259
<i>"I ain't drinking
no Patrennessy!"</i>

34:10.292 --> 34:12.060
<i>Mr. LaMont Keish!</i>

34:14.263 --> 34:16.097
<i>One of my best friends
growing up</i>

34:16.130 --> 34:18.266
<i>was this white boy
named Bobby Jack.</i>

34:18.300 --> 34:21.303
<i>His dad would say some
borderline racist shit like,</i>

34:21.337 --> 34:23.938
<i>"Don't you have
Bobby Jack out too late...</i>

34:23.972 --> 34:26.074
<i>"or you're gonna have
to hang by yourself!"</i>

34:29.277 --> 34:30.812
<i>Y'all weren't expecting
a black woman</i>

34:30.844 --> 34:32.146
<i>to come up here

34:32.181 --> 34:34.250
<i>First thing I get
when I win is</i>

34:34.283 --> 34:35.817
<i>I'm changing my name

34:37.018 --> 34:39.221
<i>There's always that one
girl to save your ass like,</i>

34:39.255 --> 34:41.155
<i>"Look like your friend
about to throw up.</i>

34:42.424 --> 34:44.393
<i>"Y'all need to
get him outside."</i>

34:45.860 --> 34:47.228
<i>You know when
gangbangers get mad?</i>

34:47.263 --> 34:49.331
<i>They get like them John McCain arms.
You know what I mean?</i>

<i>Are y'all ready

35:02.043 --> 35:05.980
<i>Our last contestant

<i>You might recognize him from

35:09.184 --> 35:10.885
<i>he has on the internet.</i>

35:10.918 --> 35:14.223
<i>We need a lot of energy and

You're up.
You got five minutes.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.925
Go a second over,
you're disqualified.

35:17.959 --> 35:19.194
Okay, cool. Thank you.

35:19.827 --> 35:21.397
All right. You ready, baby?

35:22.030 --> 35:23.432
Huh?

35:23.465 --> 35:25.133
Boom! Kill it!

35:25.166 --> 35:26.834
- Let's go. You ready?
- I'm ready.

35:26.868 --> 35:29.103
<i>Deandre McDonald!</i>

Let's go!

35:38.414 --> 35:40.449
<i>What up?</i>

35:40.482 --> 35:41.949
<i>What's going on, peoples?</i>

35:41.983 --> 35:45.086
<i>I'm from Birmingham, Alabama.</i>

35:45.119 --> 35:47.323
- <i>Uh, anybody been there?</i>
- No.

35:47.356 --> 35:48.990
- <i>Anybody from there?</i>
- No.

<i>Good. 'Cause it sucks!</i>

35:51.560 --> 35:54.062
<i>Like that shit suck bad,
and it's racist, too.</i>

35:54.095 --> 35:55.963
<i>Birmingham, Alabama,
is racist as shit.</i>

35:55.997 --> 35:58.567
<i>Like, white dude, right now.</i>

35:58.600 --> 36:01.437
<i>When you come down there your
voice will probably be the GPS</i>

36:01.470 --> 36:03.505
<i>that say this shit right here.
"Nigga, you moved the wrong fucking way."</i>

36:03.539 --> 36:06.575
<i>That's the fuck
what would happen.</i>

36:06.608 --> 36:08.910
<i>Eddie Murphy would be
a dope-ass GPS motherfucker.</i>

36:08.943 --> 36:12.247
<i>Hey, hey, motherfucker,
wait, wait, wait! One second.</i>

36:12.281 --> 36:14.015
<i>So your ass
was supposed to go south.</i>

36:14.048 --> 36:15.617
<i>You were supposed to go south.
Your ass went north,</i>

36:15.651 --> 36:17.885
<i>and now you sittin' here looking
stupid as a motherfucker.</i>

36:17.919 --> 36:19.087
<i>You were supposed
to go to Texas.</i>

36:19.120 --> 36:20.322
<i>You supposed to go to Texas.</i>

36:20.356 --> 36:21.390
<i>You were supposed to be
in Texas, motherfucker!</i>

36:21.423 --> 36:23.057
<i>But now you can't go to
Texas. You know why?</i>

36:23.091 --> 36:24.125
<i>'Cause your ass
is at a different place.</i>

36:24.158 --> 36:25.059
<i>You at a different
motherfucking place.</i>

36:25.093 --> 36:26.362
<i>You at different
motherfucking place!</i>

36:26.395 --> 36:27.329
<i>If you had listened,</i>

36:27.363 --> 36:28.630
<i>you would've been
in the right place!</i>

36:28.664 --> 36:30.098
<i>But now, you stuck.</i>

36:35.002 --> 36:35.870
<i>I'm Deandre McDonald.</i>

36:35.903 --> 36:37.439
<i>That's been my time.

39:33.782 --> 39:35.149
...but I peeped it.
You weren't bad.

39:35.183 --> 39:36.251
Mmm-hmm.

39:36.285 --> 39:37.753
You weren't good enough
to get through

39:37.786 --> 39:39.788
without somebody else
getting disqualified.

39:39.821 --> 39:40.923

Are you down?

39:49.898 --> 39:51.633
No.

39:51.667 --> 39:52.734

39:52.768 --> 39:54.369
Wait, what do you mean?

39:55.837 --> 39:58.707
Wait, wait, wait! Don't go!

39:58.740 --> 40:00.342
Wait, what do you mean?

40:06.481 --> 40:08.350
Oh. Wait a minute.

40:08.383 --> 40:10.586

40:18.527 --> 40:20.762
- <i>Deandre McDonald is nothing.</i>
- Ooh.

40:20.796 --> 40:23.198
Okay. I'mma take that
as a yes.

40:23.231 --> 40:25.767
<i>He's a weak-ass
wannabe comedian.</i>

40:25.801 --> 40:27.603
<i>He'll never be the big bird
in the flock.</i>

40:27.636 --> 40:29.338
Yeah, this is great.

40:29.371 --> 40:30.305
- That's great?
- Mmm-hmm.

40:30.339 --> 40:32.641
What's so great about
the biggest comedy star

40:32.674 --> 40:34.209
in the world
being mad at you?

40:34.242 --> 40:35.477
Because the biggest
comedy star

40:35.510 --> 40:37.212
in the world
is talking about me.

40:37.245 --> 40:38.847
Oh, I see what you saying.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.649
- Yeah.
- Congratulations!

40:40.682 --> 40:42.250
- Are you about to...
- Yup!

40:42.284 --> 40:43.352
- You about to drop some fire?
- Hell yeah. Let's do it.

40:43.385 --> 40:44.486
Drop some fire, dawg.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.756
<i>Hey, yo, what up, y'all?
Real quick.</i>

40:47.789 --> 40:48.857
<i>Did y'all see that video</i>

40:48.890 --> 40:50.826
<i>where Marques Black
was talking shit about me?</i>

40:50.859 --> 40:53.295
We all saw the crow suit.

40:53.328 --> 40:54.496
Bruh, let me tell you, really?

40:54.529 --> 40:56.231
You comfortable
with that as an actor?

40:56.264 --> 40:58.467
Playing a crow? Really?

40:58.500 --> 41:00.167
My black ass can play a crow.
You know why?

41:00.202 --> 41:01.236
Because I'm broke as shit

41:01.269 --> 41:02.337
and I'll do anything
for money.

41:02.371 --> 41:03.438
But I wouldn't let you
play a crow.

41:03.472 --> 41:04.506
Yeah, exactly.

41:04.539 --> 41:06.208
I wouldn't let you
play a crow.

41:06.241 --> 41:08.210
You wouldn't. Dude, you
could've been a peacock.

41:08.243 --> 41:09.378
Could've been.

41:09.411 --> 41:10.812
- Could've been a flamingo.
- Yeah.

41:10.846 --> 41:12.381
- Could've been a rooster.
- All day.

41:13.548 --> 41:15.217
Some shit like that. Bruh?

41:15.250 --> 41:17.185
<i>Real talk, man.
Look, look, look.</i>

41:17.219 --> 41:18.620
<i>Have some self-respect.</i>

41:18.654 --> 41:19.888
<i>I could imagine
he was just sitting there</i>

41:19.921 --> 41:21.523
<i>before his decision, right?</i>

41:21.556 --> 41:23.859
Hmm...

41:23.892 --> 41:25.794
<i>Should I play a racist,</i>

41:25.827 --> 41:29.598
jive-time walking, jive-time
talking fucking crow,

41:29.631 --> 41:31.533
whose name happens
to be Jim Crow

41:31.566 --> 41:33.268
and lives up in a tree?

41:33.301 --> 41:35.771
Which is not a euphemism
for lynching at all.

41:35.804 --> 41:37.439
<i>Nah,
I ain't mad at you, Marques.</i>

41:37.472 --> 41:39.741
<i>I'm mad at your whole team.
You know what I'm saying?</i>

41:39.775 --> 41:42.511
<i>You need to fire everybody
in your corner.</i>

41:42.544 --> 41:44.513
Uh, thanks
for the shout-out, boo!

41:44.546 --> 41:46.515
Smooches!

41:46.548 --> 41:47.683
Oh, shit!

41:52.320 --> 41:54.423
Wait a minute now.

41:54.456 --> 41:56.625
You know
you gotta post that, right?

41:56.658 --> 41:58.960
- We got to.
- Got to. Good shit.

42:02.330 --> 42:03.532
That video,
I got over 25,000 views!

42:03.565 --> 42:04.833
Why the fuck are you
hitting me so hard?

42:04.866 --> 42:06.034
Don't hit me that hard.

42:06.068 --> 42:09.504
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait!
What, you, uh, out?

42:09.538 --> 42:12.374
Yeah, I have a show to host.

42:12.407 --> 42:13.942
Oh. What kind of show?

42:14.242 --> 42:15.510
Comedy.

42:15.544 --> 42:16.878
What?

42:16.912 --> 42:18.547
I just figured,
when we were talking about

42:18.580 --> 42:20.515
the showcase,
you would've mentioned it.

42:20.549 --> 42:22.551
Well, I don't mention
a lot of shit.

42:22.584 --> 42:24.519
Especially to guys
I don't know.

42:24.553 --> 42:26.288
Well, you know me now.

42:26.722 --> 42:28.356
Uh, no. Sorry,

42:28.390 --> 42:29.858
I didn't mean to bump you.
You don't know her.

42:29.891 --> 42:30.759
You just met her.

42:30.792 --> 42:32.761
And then y'all talked
for two minutes,

42:32.794 --> 42:33.995
and now you outside,
stalking her

42:34.029 --> 42:35.530
in front of the club
in the heart of darkness

42:35.564 --> 42:36.665
asking for her resume.

42:36.698 --> 42:39.000
Dawg, you are the definition
of "stranger danger."

42:39.034 --> 42:40.635
She shouldn't
tell you shit.

42:40.669 --> 42:43.605
- He's not wrong.
- Hey, tell all your friends.

42:43.638 --> 42:44.706
Can you please tell
all your friends?

42:44.740 --> 42:45.774
Word?

42:45.807 --> 42:47.309
- Thank you.
- You defending him?

42:47.809 --> 42:49.444
You know what? I...

42:50.946 --> 42:53.749
I just had someone
cancel on me tonight.

42:53.782 --> 42:54.916
So I have an open slot

42:54.950 --> 42:56.585
if you wanna work out
some material.

42:56.618 --> 42:58.453
I'll take
whatever you give me.

42:58.920 --> 43:00.055
Cool.

43:00.088 --> 43:02.758
- Comedy Basement, 10:00 p.m.
- All right.

43:02.791 --> 43:05.494
10:00 p.m. See you later.

43:05.527 --> 43:07.662
I'll take
whatever you can give me.

43:16.772 --> 43:19.441
<i>You sexy as hell! How you doing, girl?
You can get it!</i>

43:20.575 --> 43:21.710
<i>You come out
of a clinic crying,</i>

43:21.743 --> 43:23.378
<i>I'll still pick you up.</i>

43:25.747 --> 43:26.648
<i>I'll be in the car,</i>

43:26.681 --> 43:28.750
<i>"That doctor don't
know everything!"</i>

43:30.719 --> 43:32.921
<i>I can't remember
none of my passwords.</i>

43:32.954 --> 43:35.524
<i>I changed all my passwords
to "incorrect."</i>

43:37.659 --> 43:39.895
<i>I push any key,
"Your password incorrect."</i>

43:39.928 --> 43:41.096
<i>Thank you.</i>

43:43.465 --> 43:44.866
<i>I gotta get out of here.
I love y'all!</i>

43:45.901 --> 43:48.804
Wow.

43:48.837 --> 43:50.939
<i>All right, all right!
You guys having a good time?</i>

43:50.972 --> 43:53.475
<i>Doing good?</i>

43:53.508 --> 43:54.676
<i>Okay.</i>

43:54.709 --> 43:56.812
<i>So, let's keep
the party going.</i>

43:56.845 --> 43:59.014
<i>This next guy
is new to town...</i>

43:59.047 --> 44:00.782
<i>and is a semi-finalist</i>

44:00.816 --> 44:03.885
<i>in the Laugh Out Loud
Comedy Showcase.</i>

44:03.919 --> 44:06.621
<i>Give it up
for Deandre McDonald!</i>

44:13.795 --> 44:16.031
<i>Taylor Jones. Give it up
for her one more time.</i>

44:18.800 --> 44:21.469
<i>Ah, shit.</i>

44:21.503 --> 44:24.139
<i>I am so happy to be here, man.</i>

44:24.172 --> 44:27.475
<i>I'm from, you know, from,
I'm from Birmingham, Alabama.</i>

44:27.509 --> 44:28.877
<i>Small town, you know?</i>

44:28.910 --> 44:30.512
<i>Anybody from there?</i>

44:30.545 --> 44:31.746
I am. What about it?

44:33.815 --> 44:34.916
<i>Oh.</i>

44:34.950 --> 44:36.051
<i>Cool, that's...</i>

44:36.084 --> 44:38.787
You needed audience to say,
"No, we not from there,"

44:38.820 --> 44:40.622
so you can tell us
all about it?

44:42.858 --> 44:43.992
<i>Yeah, man.</i>

44:45.194 --> 44:46.528
<i>You got me.</i>

44:46.928 --> 44:48.096
<i>Great.</i>

44:48.129 --> 44:52.100
<i>Uh, well, if you're not
from Birmingham, Alabama...</i>

44:52.133 --> 44:53.368
<i>consider yourself lucky...</i>

44:53.401 --> 44:55.003
- <i>'cause I'm gonna tell you...</i>
- 'Cause it sucks, right?

44:56.071 --> 44:57.572
It's gotta suck.

44:57.606 --> 44:59.774
It's not funny
if it doesn't suck, folks.

44:59.808 --> 45:02.410
<i>Uh...</i>

45:02.444 --> 45:05.914
<i>Yeah, man, it sucks.
It's terrible.</i>

45:07.048 --> 45:08.783
<i>It's bad.</i>

45:08.817 --> 45:09.918
<i>Not bad and boujee.</i>

45:09.951 --> 45:11.987
<i>The shit just bad.</i>

45:12.020 --> 45:13.154
<i>So you ever notice</i>

45:13.189 --> 45:14.522
<i>that your girl's
kind of a hypocrite?</i>

45:14.556 --> 45:15.757
- Yeah.
- <i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

45:15.790 --> 45:17.158
<i>Thank you.</i>

45:17.193 --> 45:18.793
<i>Thank you, Snoop Khalifa.
I appreciate that.</i>

45:19.728 --> 45:21.496
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

45:21.529 --> 45:23.598
<i>Think about that.
She is though!</i>

45:23.632 --> 45:25.700
<i>She can get naked
in front of her friends.</i>

45:25.734 --> 45:27.002
- <i>But as soon as I try...</i>
- <i>Soon as you do it,</i>

45:27.035 --> 45:30.005
<i>it's a whole different story, right?
That's the punch line?</i>

45:38.546 --> 45:41.416
That was the punch line.
He is good!

45:44.986 --> 45:45.987
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:47.088 --> 45:48.190
<i>All right.</i>

45:48.224 --> 45:50.625
<i>Give it up for him trying to
be a comedian here tonight.</i>

45:50.659 --> 45:52.127
<i>He did a good job,</i>

45:52.160 --> 45:54.863
<i>except for the part where
he let a real comedian</i>

45:54.896 --> 45:58.033
<i>come up and stop him
in the middle of his own show.</i>

45:58.066 --> 46:00.502
<i>But let me tell them
what they missing.</i>

46:00.535 --> 46:02.637
<i>Oh. Y'all was gonna love it!</i>

46:02.671 --> 46:06.007
<i>It is the best hack shit
you ever heard!</i>

46:06.041 --> 46:08.143
<i>So he's gonna tell us
all about relationships</i>

46:08.177 --> 46:10.045
<i>and how hard those are. Right?</i>

46:10.078 --> 46:12.514
<i>Then he's gonna segue
into differences</i>

46:12.547 --> 46:13.815
<i>between black people
and white people.</i>

46:13.848 --> 46:15.550
<i>Weren't you?</i>

46:15.583 --> 46:17.552
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Yup, yup.</i>

46:17.585 --> 46:19.188
<i>Then talk about rap music
so you could do</i>

46:19.221 --> 46:21.089
<i>your little lazy
Jay-Z impression?</i>

46:25.126 --> 46:27.696
<i>There it is. That's the one
I was talking about, yup.</i>

46:27.729 --> 46:28.964
<i>You was gonna
talk about politics,</i>

46:28.997 --> 46:30.498
<i>so you could do Obama, right?</i>

46:30.532 --> 46:32.167
<i>I was gonna do Trump,
actually.</i>

46:32.201 --> 46:36.137
<i>Obama is out and Trump is in.
How progressive of you.</i>

46:38.240 --> 46:41.142
<i>He was gonna do
Tracy Morgan and Chris Rock.</i>

46:41.177 --> 46:42.244
<i>Were they what you gonna do?</i>

46:42.278 --> 46:44.813
<i>I was gonna do Mike Epps.
That's what I was gonna do.</i>

46:44.846 --> 46:46.915
- <i>Yeah, of course you were.</i>
- <i>But you know what, man?</i>

46:46.948 --> 46:48.850
<i>But Mike Epps
is probably doing Mike Epps.</i>

46:48.883 --> 46:50.085
<i>Why don't you do you?</i>

46:52.887 --> 46:55.056
<i>Do your shit.
Talk about your life.</i>

46:55.090 --> 46:56.558
<i>But you can't,</i>

46:56.591 --> 46:58.927
<i>'cause you practiced
this shit on YouTube!</i>

46:58.960 --> 47:00.262
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

47:00.829 --> 47:03.565
<i>I get them views though.</i>

47:03.598 --> 47:06.034
<i>He get
them views though.</i>

47:06.735 --> 47:08.270
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:08.304 --> 47:10.905
<i>Let me ask you a question.</i>

47:10.939 --> 47:12.941
<i>If a dog took a shit
in the middle of this room,</i>

47:12.974 --> 47:14.976
<i>wouldn't everybody view it?</i>

47:16.845 --> 47:19.614
<i>That's your whole career,
my dude.</i>

47:20.249 --> 47:22.150
<i>We look at you</i>

47:22.184 --> 47:25.020
<i>when we waiting in line,
or we waiting on a Uber.</i>

47:25.053 --> 47:26.688
<i>That's when you get a view.</i>

47:26.721 --> 47:28.123
<i>When we taking a shit,</i>

47:28.156 --> 47:29.824
<i>we view the shit,</i>

47:29.858 --> 47:31.559
<i>then we view you.</i>

47:31.593 --> 47:32.827
<i>Two views.</i>

47:34.162 --> 47:35.498
<i>That's why
it's called number two.</i>

47:35.530 --> 47:38.267
<i>You see how it's a real joke
crafted by a real comedian?</i>

47:38.300 --> 47:40.336
<i>That's the difference there.
That's the difference.</i>

47:40.369 --> 47:42.204
<i>I'm not viewed.
I'm an experience.</i>

47:42.238 --> 47:44.039
<i>I'm here. I'm here.</i>

47:44.072 --> 47:46.107
<i>That's places
you'll never get to</i>

47:46.141 --> 47:48.244
<i>with this weak-ass shit
you serving</i>

47:48.277 --> 47:51.046
<i>at the Comedy Basement
this evening.</i>

47:51.079 --> 47:53.715
<i>Anyway, folks, I'm sorry
for bringing the mood down.</i>

47:53.748 --> 47:55.884
<i>Drinks on me. Please enjoy
the rest of your night.</i>

47:57.685 --> 47:59.954
<i>Thank you for coming.
God bless you. Good night.</i>

47:59.988 --> 48:01.923
It's still hot.
You might wanna use this one.

48:06.895 --> 48:08.330
How much money
you think it was?

48:08.364 --> 48:10.765
I think it was at least a G,
maybe 1500, right?

48:10.799 --> 48:13.335
He just threw the money on the
fucking stage like it wasn't nothing.

48:13.369 --> 48:14.669
Dre, did you see it?
Of course you saw.

48:14.702 --> 48:17.072
You was right there.
He threw the fucking money in your face.

48:17.105 --> 48:20.176
That's how I wanna be.
I wanna be like Marques Black.

48:20.209 --> 48:22.244
Hey, Benedict Arnold. Huh?
Fuck Marques Black! Okay?

48:22.278 --> 48:23.678
Oh, come on, man.
Don't hate.

48:23.711 --> 48:24.879
Don't hate
'cause he got money.

48:24.913 --> 48:26.282
He wasn't wrong!

48:26.315 --> 48:28.083
Y'all YouTubers
don't appreciate

48:28.116 --> 48:30.386
how much of an art
stand-up is.

48:30.419 --> 48:32.053
You wanna win this showcase,

48:32.087 --> 48:34.190
you better step it up 'cause
it's not a game out here.

48:34.223 --> 48:35.458
Tell you
what ain't a game.

48:35.491 --> 48:38.294
The fact that you cannot get
food in LA after 10:00 p.m.

48:38.327 --> 48:40.028
That's how y'all stay
so fucking skinny.

48:40.061 --> 48:42.063
You don't have access to
food late at night!

48:42.097 --> 48:43.131
Maybe you better eat
some sleep!

48:43.164 --> 48:44.233
I'mma have to. Shit!

48:44.266 --> 48:46.968
I ain't got no damn money.
We broke, both of us!

48:47.001 --> 48:48.770
- Here.
- Together!

48:48.803 --> 48:50.772
Take this. For tonight.

48:50.805 --> 48:51.940
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

48:51.973 --> 48:55.244
No, thank you.
I can't accept money for doing shows,

48:55.277 --> 48:56.945
while I'm doing
the showcase.

48:56.978 --> 48:59.981
- Are you serious?
- It's not for your show.

49:00.014 --> 49:02.117
Actually, you owe me money
for that bullshit,

49:02.150 --> 49:04.752
so, come on,
it's just a few bucks for some food.

49:04.786 --> 49:07.021
What type of <i>Lady and the
Tramp</i> cash grabbing...

49:07.055 --> 49:09.191
- Let go! She's doing us a favor, man!
- What the hell?

49:09.225 --> 49:11.059
God damn!

49:11.092 --> 49:13.895
You weren't lying, boy.
It's just a few bucks.

49:13.928 --> 49:15.663
But you know what?
Beggars can't be choosers.

49:15.697 --> 49:17.299
I'll give you 10.
I'll keep 10.

49:17.333 --> 49:19.134
Thank you, Taylor.
I appreciate this.

49:20.902 --> 49:22.637
Hey, yo, wait up!

49:23.138 --> 49:24.273
Come on!

49:24.306 --> 49:26.040
What up, buddy?

49:26.074 --> 49:27.976
<i>Thomas in piano
is still messing with me.</i>

49:28.009 --> 49:28.977
<i>What happened this time?</i>

49:29.010 --> 49:30.346
All I did was take
the piano you made me

49:30.379 --> 49:32.780
to class so I could
show Miss Ellen.

49:32.814 --> 49:36.252
Oh, Jaylin, you took
the cardboard piano to class?

49:36.285 --> 49:37.752
Yeah.

49:37.785 --> 49:39.954
<i>Buddy,
that's an at home piano.</i>

49:39.988 --> 49:41.689
<i>We don't show that
to anybody.</i>

49:41.723 --> 49:43.259
<i>Well, I think it's cool,</i>

49:43.292 --> 49:45.126
<i>but they just
kept on laughing at it,</i>

49:45.160 --> 49:47.061
<i>saying that we can't
afford a real piano.</i>

49:47.095 --> 49:50.765
That's 'cause
it's not cool, Jaylin.

49:50.798 --> 49:53.335
<i>Didn't I tell you I was gonna get
you a dope set of keys one day?</i>

49:53.835 --> 49:54.936
Yeah.

49:54.969 --> 49:56.338
<i>Then believe that.</i>

49:56.372 --> 49:58.907
<i>Just keep the cardboard piano
at home from now on.</i>

49:58.940 --> 50:00.309
- <i>Okay?</i>
- All right.

50:00.342 --> 50:01.843
Now where's your mom?

50:01.876 --> 50:05.046
She's right here,
reading her nurse book.

50:05.079 --> 50:06.348
Go upstairs, baby.

50:08.750 --> 50:09.751
What?

50:11.019 --> 50:12.288
What up with you?

50:12.321 --> 50:13.322
Nothing.

50:14.223 --> 50:16.057
You pay the rent okay?

50:16.090 --> 50:17.193
<i>Yup.</i>

50:17.226 --> 50:19.761
Oh. I've been calling you.

50:20.061 --> 50:21.297
<i>So?</i>

50:21.330 --> 50:22.864
<i>I made
it to the second round</i>

50:22.897 --> 50:23.998
<i>of the showcase.</i>

50:24.266 --> 50:25.267
Cool.

50:26.468 --> 50:28.337
<i>Oh, I get it. Yeah.</i>

50:28.370 --> 50:31.307
<i>So we in the one word
part of the fight, huh?</i>

50:31.340 --> 50:33.107
- Fuck you.
- <i>Ha!</i>

50:33.141 --> 50:35.477
Two words! That's progress.

50:35.511 --> 50:38.046
<i>I can see you smiling!</i>

50:38.079 --> 50:39.847
Bye, Deandre. Bye.

50:39.881 --> 50:41.015
<i>You so chocolatey mocha...</i>

50:45.019 --> 50:46.455
Shit!

50:49.225 --> 50:51.393
License and registration.

50:54.162 --> 50:55.197
Morning.

50:55.231 --> 50:56.798
Uh, morning, Officer.

50:56.831 --> 50:58.534
You do realize
you're in a tow-away zone?

50:58.567 --> 51:00.768
Oh, damn it!
Well, uh...

51:01.970 --> 51:04.072
Well, can I park over there?

51:04.105 --> 51:06.242
Not if you're gonna
fall asleep again.

51:07.209 --> 51:08.444
Wait, are those braces?

51:08.477 --> 51:10.446
What are you,
a dental hygienist?

51:10.479 --> 51:12.113
Ain't you a little too old
to have braces?

51:12.146 --> 51:13.415
You're not too old
to get shot.

51:13.449 --> 51:15.184
Okay, turning the car on

51:15.217 --> 51:16.985
and getting
the fuck out of here.

51:22.591 --> 51:24.293
<i>Not only did
the superstar rant about</i>

51:24.326 --> 51:25.994
<i>the Instagram comedian,</i>

51:26.027 --> 51:29.331
<i>he heckled him at the poor
kid's amateur comedy show.</i>

51:29.365 --> 51:31.400
<i>This is all in
How to Be a Comedian 101.</i>

51:31.433 --> 51:34.068
<i>He just began studying this,
as y'all can tell.</i>

51:34.102 --> 51:35.337
<i>Yeah.</i>

51:35.371 --> 51:38.039
<i>With the pressure of his
last few box office bombs</i>

51:38.072 --> 51:40.509
<i>insiders suspect that Black
is feeling threatened</i>

51:40.542 --> 51:42.110
<i>by the comedy newcomer.</i>

51:42.143 --> 51:44.446
I don't feel
threatened by shit.

51:44.480 --> 51:45.648
Hmm. That's good.

51:45.681 --> 51:49.050
If that was me, if somebody
was trying to replace me...

51:49.083 --> 51:50.419
I'd be scared.

51:50.452 --> 51:51.520
I'd be writing
my will right now.

51:51.553 --> 51:52.854
'Cause if you play
it back, right?

51:52.887 --> 51:53.988
- Jethro.
- If you look

51:54.022 --> 51:55.990
- at what he said...
- Jethro.

51:56.024 --> 51:57.992
If you wanna keep coming
to work with me...

51:58.960 --> 52:00.895
shut the fuck up.

52:00.928 --> 52:02.096
Sorry, Uncle Nico.

52:02.130 --> 52:03.332
Shut the fuck up.

52:03.365 --> 52:06.235
And what box office bombs?
I make hits.

52:07.035 --> 52:09.271
Actually,
your last few movies,

52:09.305 --> 52:10.572
they ain't even
on demand. Look.

52:10.606 --> 52:12.140
If we go look for 'em...

52:12.173 --> 52:13.174
Jethro...

52:13.908 --> 52:16.110
I will have my dogs
eat you alive,

52:16.144 --> 52:17.513
if you don't shut
the fuck up.

52:20.516 --> 52:22.016
Marq, look, man.

52:22.050 --> 52:24.052
You can't keep listening
to them people, all right?

52:24.085 --> 52:26.087
'Cause they gonna make
a story about anything.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.855
Another story gonna come
in the news

52:27.889 --> 52:29.224
and it's gonna knock
this right out,

52:29.258 --> 52:31.059
and ain't nobody gonna
be worried about this shit.

52:31.092 --> 52:33.061
- Don't even worry about that.
- All right.

52:33.094 --> 52:34.229
I would expect that
from you, Nico.

52:34.263 --> 52:35.464
My man.

52:35.497 --> 52:36.864
'Cause this your fault.

52:36.898 --> 52:38.467
How's it my fault?

52:38.500 --> 52:39.601
You got me in a situation

52:39.635 --> 52:41.603
where I can't
trust nobody, Nico!

52:41.637 --> 52:44.138
What have you managed
to do but surround me

52:44.172 --> 52:46.308
by motherfuckers
I don't even fucking know?

52:46.342 --> 52:47.476
I don't know her!

52:47.509 --> 52:48.644
I don't know her!

52:48.677 --> 52:51.280
I don't know
none of these niggas!

52:51.313 --> 52:53.215
Right now,
in my very own house,

52:53.248 --> 52:54.183
I could be talking

52:54.216 --> 52:56.385
while a nigga's
filming me in my mouth!

52:56.418 --> 52:58.520
Ain't nobody
filming you, Marq. Relax!

52:58.554 --> 53:00.088
What you talking about?

53:04.460 --> 53:05.960
Damn phone off!

53:05.993 --> 53:06.961
Sorry.

53:06.994 --> 53:08.896
This is a game to everybody
but me and Nico.

53:08.930 --> 53:10.666
I need you to fix this shit.

53:10.699 --> 53:12.934
What am I supposed to do
about that?

53:12.967 --> 53:14.936
All right, well,
you the manager.

53:14.969 --> 53:16.938
Manage this shit!

53:20.141 --> 53:21.210
Uncle Nico.

53:22.411 --> 53:25.280
You think his dogs
really be eating people?

53:25.314 --> 53:27.416
That motherfucker almost
bit me when I came in.

53:28.183 --> 53:30.118
I'mma shoot you.

53:30.151 --> 53:31.587
I'mma shoot you
in the face.

53:31.620 --> 53:32.654
You gonna shoot me?

53:32.688 --> 53:34.356
I'mma shoot you
in the face.

53:42.331 --> 53:43.699
Wow.

53:43.732 --> 53:46.134
Dudes be thirsty
in Birmingham.

53:46.167 --> 53:47.403
Uh,
don't flatter yourself, okay?

53:47.436 --> 53:48.504
I'm working on my jokes.

53:48.537 --> 53:51.240
Oh, so there wasn't another
bar in all of Los Angeles?

53:51.273 --> 53:53.709
I guess if you did that,

53:53.742 --> 53:56.245
you couldn't see
my pretty face.

53:56.278 --> 53:57.546
Who said you were pretty?

53:57.579 --> 53:59.080
That look on your face.

54:00.482 --> 54:01.650
Busted.

54:01.683 --> 54:04.085
Well, I'm glad you're here.

54:04.118 --> 54:07.222
Well, sorry, country boy.
I don't have time to play.

54:07.256 --> 54:09.491
I got work to do 'cause these
jokes don't write themselves.

54:09.525 --> 54:11.360
Hey,
wait, wait, wait.

54:11.393 --> 54:12.628
You write jokes?

54:12.661 --> 54:14.128
Yeah.

54:14.162 --> 54:16.964
I write, act, tell jokes.

54:16.998 --> 54:18.467
I'm a one-stop shop.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.536
Oh. Dope.

54:20.569 --> 54:22.571
Just dope.

54:22.604 --> 54:26.742
Uh, any help
with your material?

54:26.775 --> 54:28.644
You know, I give
good notes, you know?

54:28.677 --> 54:32.113
I am also known
for my excellent timing

54:32.146 --> 54:34.081
and sardonic wit.

54:34.115 --> 54:36.485
Sardonic wit?
Girl, that's a sex word.

54:36.518 --> 54:38.253
If you don't get out of here,
in the words of Eddie Murphy.

54:38.287 --> 54:39.288
Girl, you better go ahead

54:39.321 --> 54:40.589
and get out of here
before something happens.

54:40.622 --> 54:42.023
You know what I'm saying?

54:42.056 --> 54:43.392
Listen, once you unload
Pandora's box,

54:43.425 --> 54:45.260
once you open Pandora's
box, you can't close it.

54:45.294 --> 54:46.361
That's right.
Once you unleash the kraken,

54:46.395 --> 54:47.663
it's gonna be crackin'!

54:47.696 --> 54:49.364
Now, go ahead and get up out of here.

54:49.398 --> 54:51.098
No, stay. Now, go.

54:51.132 --> 54:52.334
Now, stay, go. Stay, go.

54:59.675 --> 55:01.276
I dated a bisexual chick.

55:01.310 --> 55:02.678
Couldn't trust her ass
around nobody.

55:03.812 --> 55:05.380
- Like that?
- No.

55:07.282 --> 55:09.384
Ah! Yeah, my perky tits.

55:09.418 --> 55:11.420
<i>This has been a rough year, people.
Hasn't it?</i>

55:11.453 --> 55:13.722
<i>I can't believe we have
allowed this to happen,</i>

55:13.755 --> 55:15.324
<i>as a country.</i>

55:15.357 --> 55:16.492
<i>As a black man,
I can't believe it.</i>

55:16.525 --> 55:18.627
<i>As an American citizen,
I can't believe this shit.</i>

55:18.660 --> 55:20.195
<i>I feel like it's
ridiculous.</i>

55:20.229 --> 55:22.331
<i>I can't believe the Verizon
man switched to Sprint.</i>

55:22.364 --> 55:24.031
<i>I never thought
that shit was gonna happen.</i>

55:35.744 --> 55:37.312
<i>It's a bad time
to be a creep.</i>

55:37.346 --> 55:39.781
<i>You cannot be
a creep anymore.</i>

55:39.815 --> 55:41.383
<i>That goes for you, guy,
right here.</i>

55:41.416 --> 55:42.784
<i>You can't be a creep.</i>

55:42.818 --> 55:44.419
<i>You can't be a creep
anymore, man.</i>

55:44.453 --> 55:45.521
<i>They getting everybody.</i>

55:53.295 --> 55:55.397
- Yo!
- Is this a diary?

55:55.430 --> 55:58.367
No, it's not a diary.
I don't have a diary, okay?

55:58.400 --> 55:59.401
Got a journal.

55:59.434 --> 56:01.336
What y'all talkin'
about? How Dre got a diary?

56:01.370 --> 56:02.437
- Mmm-hmm.
- Shut up, fool.

56:02.471 --> 56:04.806
What? No, it's just where
he complain about shit.

56:05.641 --> 56:07.276
Okay, wait.

56:08.744 --> 56:11.213
You made your son a piano
out of cardboard?

56:11.246 --> 56:12.180
Yes, I did.

56:12.214 --> 56:14.349
I didn't have money
to get him a real one

56:14.383 --> 56:16.150
and he had to practice.

56:17.619 --> 56:21.155
Okay, this shit is hilarious!

56:21.189 --> 56:23.759
Glad you find my failures
as a man funny...

56:23.792 --> 56:25.727
- sweetheart.
- Honestly,

56:25.761 --> 56:27.229
that stuff is funnier
than anything

56:27.262 --> 56:28.430
you've said on that stage.

56:29.264 --> 56:31.266
You should be using it.

56:31.300 --> 56:34.168
Come on, you heard Marques
the other night.

56:34.803 --> 56:36.305
Tell your truth

56:37.171 --> 56:38.774
and make it funny.

56:41.910 --> 56:45.480
Nobody's gonna care
about me being a shitty dad.

56:45.514 --> 56:47.649
Yeah, except everyone
in the audience

56:47.683 --> 56:49.785
that also feels
like a shitty dad.

56:54.356 --> 56:55.557
<i>Bruh,
let me tell you, really?</i>

56:55.591 --> 56:57.492
<i>You comfortable
with that as an actor?</i>

56:57.526 --> 57:00.228
<i>Am I gonna play
a racist crow</i>

57:00.262 --> 57:02.598
<i>whose name
is actually Jim Crow</i>

57:02.631 --> 57:03.665
<i>who lives in a tree,</i>

57:03.699 --> 57:06.368
<i>which is not a euphemism
for lynching at all.</i>

57:06.401 --> 57:07.703
<i>What should I do?</i>

57:18.880 --> 57:20.816
Hey, let's get it,
let's get it.

57:20.849 --> 57:23.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

57:23.185 --> 57:24.286
I thought you said
we was going to Taylor's.

57:24.319 --> 57:26.722
No, no, no.
We ain't gonna do shit.

57:26.755 --> 57:28.357
See, I'm gonna
go hang out with Taylor.

57:28.390 --> 57:29.391
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:29.424 --> 57:31.827
Dre, you don't even know
this girl, man. Okay?

57:31.860 --> 57:33.362
She could be a temptress.

57:33.395 --> 57:34.896
I could be leaving you alone

57:34.930 --> 57:36.732
in the clutches
of a temptress.

57:36.765 --> 57:37.899
When you make bad decisions,

57:37.933 --> 57:39.067
it tends to reflect
poorly on me.

57:39.101 --> 57:41.236
Oh, it's not gonna reflect
poorly on you, my brother.

57:41.269 --> 57:44.439
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my best friend, my brother.

57:44.473 --> 57:46.375
Appreciate it. Yeah.

57:46.408 --> 57:47.609
Hope it's worth it.

57:53.649 --> 57:54.816
Shit!

57:58.520 --> 58:01.223
Expecting a call?

58:01.256 --> 58:02.724
Huh? What?

58:02.758 --> 58:05.627
- Nah, baby, I'm here with you.
- Mmm.

58:05.661 --> 58:08.263
I know that,
and you know that.

58:08.296 --> 58:10.298
But does she know that?

58:11.600 --> 58:14.302
- Yeah, I peeped your socials.
- Mmm.

58:16.672 --> 58:18.807
Who is Sky?

58:20.842 --> 58:22.611
It's complicated.

58:22.644 --> 58:23.745
Mmm.

58:27.449 --> 58:28.717
Works for me.

58:32.454 --> 58:33.522
Dre, you gotta take me
to the hospital!

58:33.555 --> 58:34.556
What?

58:34.923 --> 58:37.325
Nigga!

58:37.359 --> 58:38.593
You gotta take me
to the hospital!

58:38.627 --> 58:40.362
What? Why?

58:40.395 --> 58:42.230
- Because I got cancer.
- You have cancer?

58:42.264 --> 58:43.565
- No, he got cancer.
- I don't got cancer.

58:43.598 --> 58:44.766
Wait. Do you have
anything else?

58:44.800 --> 58:46.501
- No. Do you?
- No!

58:46.535 --> 58:47.636
You know what?
Y'all don't sound sure

58:47.669 --> 58:48.804
so why don't we all
get tested

58:48.837 --> 58:49.938
before the fun stuff
and then we'll save

58:49.971 --> 58:51.373
this visit for another day.

58:51.406 --> 58:52.808
- Wait, no, no!
- We gotta go.

58:52.841 --> 58:55.310
Let go, let go.
Go, go. Go, go.

58:55.343 --> 58:56.678
Have a good night.

59:03.585 --> 59:06.421
Cancer? That's the most
realistic excuse?

59:06.455 --> 59:07.622
Dawg, I'm sorry.
It's all I could think of.

59:07.656 --> 59:08.924
I just had to get you
out of there.

59:08.957 --> 59:10.692
- I was good.
- Whatever, man.

59:10.726 --> 59:13.462
All I know is that
if you fuck this up with Sky,

59:13.495 --> 59:15.263
you gonna find
some way to blame me.

59:15.297 --> 59:16.965
- Like you did with jorts.
- Hey. Jean shorts are a thing.

59:16.998 --> 59:18.300
Not for your legs.

59:18.333 --> 59:19.401
Oh, come on.
Don't talk about my legs.

59:19.434 --> 59:20.702
- They're my mama legs.
- All right.

59:20.736 --> 59:21.970
I don't know.
You could've interrupted

59:22.003 --> 59:23.505
something real, bruh.

59:23.538 --> 59:24.773
You know, I'm just saying,
Taylor gets me.

59:24.806 --> 59:26.007
We care about the same things.

59:26.041 --> 59:27.275
And she's fine.

59:27.309 --> 59:28.977
- She's funny.
- And she's fine.

59:29.010 --> 59:32.314
And everything is just
so easy with her, man.

59:32.347 --> 59:34.783
With Sky, it's just
so difficult and complicated.

59:34.816 --> 59:35.884
This might be
the one chance I got

59:35.917 --> 59:37.285
to be with somebody

59:37.319 --> 59:39.554
who wants
the same things as me.

59:39.588 --> 59:40.655
And she's fine.

59:40.689 --> 59:42.557
Fine enough to only see
your son on the weekends?

59:42.591 --> 59:43.625
- No.
- Exactly.

59:43.658 --> 59:46.061
But a lot of good things
happen on the weekends.

59:46.094 --> 59:50.298
Uh, Saturday morning cartoons.
Football. Bottomless mimosas.

59:51.733 --> 59:53.869
- Yeah.
- What?

59:53.902 --> 59:56.037
Yes, yes, y'all.

59:57.773 --> 59:59.274
So good.

59:59.674 --> 01:00:02.043
Go, baby, go.

01:00:02.077 --> 01:00:03.445
Oh, yeah!

01:00:07.716 --> 01:00:09.851
So, let me see
if I got this right.

01:00:09.885 --> 01:00:13.722
So, a black man
shucking and jiving...

01:00:13.755 --> 01:00:15.891
in a crow suit
with gold chains

01:00:15.924 --> 01:00:18.493
is absolutely hilarious
to y'all?

01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:20.629
Oh, come on.
No one thinks that.

01:00:20.662 --> 01:00:22.364
I mean,
you're killing it.

01:00:22.397 --> 01:00:24.833
What do y'all think then?

01:00:24.866 --> 01:00:26.768
We think that you're a
comedic genius

01:00:26.802 --> 01:00:28.503
who can do whatever he wants.

01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.340
I'm with you.

01:00:32.374 --> 01:00:33.909
He can do whatever he wants.

01:00:33.942 --> 01:00:36.578
I wanna quit.

01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:38.747
Uh, well, uh,
you have a contract.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.116
Yeah, well,
fuck the contract.

01:00:41.149 --> 01:00:43.018
If the contract means
I gotta do this...

01:00:44.686 --> 01:00:46.421
I just can't do it.

01:00:46.454 --> 01:00:48.056
Look, we didn't mean
any disrespect.

01:00:48.089 --> 01:00:50.759
Marques, look,
you're taking a beating in the press.

01:00:50.792 --> 01:00:52.460
Okay, we get it.

01:00:52.494 --> 01:00:56.565
If you want us to handle
this McDonald kid, we got it.

01:00:56.598 --> 01:00:58.867
Josh, I told you
not to mention that.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.101
What y'all gonna do anyway?

01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:01.903
Rough him up in the alley
or somethin'?

01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:05.774
Just get the fuck
outta here. Now.

01:01:05.807 --> 01:01:07.142
- Okay.
- We're sorry.

01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:08.844
And we're going
to leave right now.

01:01:08.877 --> 01:01:10.579
That way. That way.

01:01:10.612 --> 01:01:12.080
Back on my phone.

01:01:12.113 --> 01:01:13.849
So, let me get this straight.

01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:17.652
We are walkin' away
from a $20 million paycheck

01:01:17.686 --> 01:01:22.023
because you're mad
at a social media influencer?

01:01:22.057 --> 01:01:24.559
Who does that?
What are you doin'?

01:01:25.694 --> 01:01:27.762
What are you doin', Marq? Yo.

01:01:28.797 --> 01:01:30.065
We're not walkin' away.

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:32.634
I am.

01:01:32.667 --> 01:01:34.069
Turn this shit off.

01:01:46.948 --> 01:01:48.617
Look at this punk.

01:02:03.498 --> 01:02:05.100
Jaylin, what happened?

01:02:05.133 --> 01:02:06.835
I got into a fight. Cool, huh?

01:02:06.868 --> 01:02:09.205
<i>No. Come on, boy, you know you
ain't supposed to be fighting.</i>

01:02:09.238 --> 01:02:10.538
Did you win?

01:02:10.572 --> 01:02:11.806
<i>I think so.</i>

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.708
Oh, that's my boy. Yeah.

01:02:13.742 --> 01:02:15.644
It was that kid
from piano class, huh?

01:02:15.677 --> 01:02:17.479
Yeah. I ain't no punk.

01:02:17.512 --> 01:02:18.713
I know you ain't
no punk, boy.

01:02:18.747 --> 01:02:20.048
You got hands
like your father.

01:02:20.081 --> 01:02:22.184
They're Muhammad Ali hands.
That's what they are.

01:02:22.218 --> 01:02:23.652
You float like a butterfly,

01:02:23.685 --> 01:02:25.053
sting like a bee.

01:02:25.086 --> 01:02:27.656
You're the world's greatest.
And you're pretty.

01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:29.457
Your head got baby hair.

01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:31.559
- <i>It's nice.</i>
- You're grounded, boy.

01:02:31.593 --> 01:02:34.596
Go brush your teeth. Fast.

01:02:34.629 --> 01:02:36.498
<i>Baby, don't be
so hard on the boy.</i>

01:02:36.531 --> 01:02:37.866
<i>I wouldn't have to be</i>

01:02:37.899 --> 01:02:39.235
<i>if his daddy was here
to do it for me.</i>

01:02:39.268 --> 01:02:41.603
Oh, so I'm
a deadbeat dad now, huh?

01:02:41.636 --> 01:02:43.071
<i>You know
that's not what I meant.</i>

01:02:43.104 --> 01:02:45.674
<i>Sky, I'm out here taking
care of my business.</i>

01:02:45.707 --> 01:02:47.108
<i>Why can't you just
help me do that?</i>

01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:48.411
You know what, Deandre?

01:02:48.443 --> 01:02:50.645
If you're taking care of you,
and I'm taking care of you...

01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.514
who is taking care of me?

01:02:52.547 --> 01:02:53.815
I will.

01:02:53.848 --> 01:02:56.885
As soon as I win this
showcase and get back.

01:02:56.918 --> 01:02:59.054
Sky, come on.
This isn't us.

01:02:59.087 --> 01:03:02.258
You know I got your back.
Why can't you just have mine?

01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:05.227
Can you do that for me? Baby?

01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:07.495
<i>♪ Can you do that for
me, baby? ♪</i>

01:03:07.529 --> 01:03:09.231
<i>♪ Baby</i>

01:03:09.265 --> 01:03:10.732
Stop!

01:03:10.765 --> 01:03:12.133
You know I don't like
when you start singing.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:14.035
<i>Okay.
Hey, is the boy gone?</i>

01:03:14.303 --> 01:03:15.637
Yeah.

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:16.771
Let me see your titty.

01:03:16.805 --> 01:03:17.839
Just whip it out.

01:03:17.872 --> 01:03:19.741
Show me a nipple
or somethin'.

01:03:19.774 --> 01:03:22.911
I need that. It's my life.
They're nice and chocolatey.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.847
<i>Psych! Bye!</i>

01:04:09.191 --> 01:04:10.558
Boy crazy.

01:04:10.592 --> 01:04:11.693
<i>You believe this shit?</i>

01:04:12.994 --> 01:04:14.296
<i>Me neither. I can't believe</i>

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:15.897
<i>the Verizon man
switched to Sprint.</i>

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:18.200
<i>I never thought that shit
was gonna happen.</i>

01:04:19.868 --> 01:04:21.770
- Boy is stupid.
- <i>I was like...</i>

01:04:24.606 --> 01:04:26.708
Who the hell? What?

01:04:29.677 --> 01:04:31.012
What the hell?

01:04:32.214 --> 01:04:34.616
I mean, if you into
that kind of thing.

01:04:44.959 --> 01:04:46.895
Look at this bitch
one more time.

01:04:57.705 --> 01:05:00.642
Oh, shit.

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:10.319
Oh, boy.

01:05:10.352 --> 01:05:11.686
Never been so happy
to see a bed in my life.

01:05:11.719 --> 01:05:12.921
Right?

01:05:12.954 --> 01:05:14.155
You sure
we won't owe nobody?

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:16.124
Oh, I'm positive, Dre.

01:05:16.157 --> 01:05:18.360
Pretty sure somebody
let it slip

01:05:18.394 --> 01:05:20.329
that we lost
our hotel room somehow

01:05:20.362 --> 01:05:22.264
and we been sleeping
in our car.

01:05:22.298 --> 01:05:24.200
Who you think let it slip?

01:05:24.233 --> 01:05:26.935
Oh, it was me, Dre.
I let it slip.

01:05:26.968 --> 01:05:28.803
Of course.

01:05:34.676 --> 01:05:36.010
No.

01:05:36.044 --> 01:05:37.112
No, no, no, no.

01:05:38.713 --> 01:05:39.881
What? What?

01:05:39.914 --> 01:05:41.015
- No! No.
- What?

01:05:41.049 --> 01:05:42.784
- No. No. No.
- What?

01:05:42.817 --> 01:05:45.221
No, man. Taylor just tagged
a pic of me on Facebook.

01:05:45.254 --> 01:05:47.088
- And Sky saw it.
- How you know she saw it?

01:05:47.122 --> 01:05:48.156
Because, nigga,
she just liked it.

01:05:49.291 --> 01:05:50.859
Well, that means
that she saw it

01:05:50.892 --> 01:05:52.394
and she wants you
to know she saw it.

01:05:54.396 --> 01:05:56.164
Oh, shit.

01:05:56.198 --> 01:05:58.066
Okay.
It's fine. It's fine.

01:05:58.099 --> 01:05:59.901
Ain't no problem. Ain't no problem.
I'll just delete it.

01:05:59.934 --> 01:06:02.137
It never happened. Her eyes
are playing tricks on her.

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:04.172
So now you playing her
and you think she's stupid?

01:06:04.206 --> 01:06:06.875
Look, Dre. That's what
she's gonna say to you.

01:06:06.908 --> 01:06:08.009
Oh, look,
she typin' somethin'.

01:06:08.042 --> 01:06:09.178
On the picture?

01:06:09.211 --> 01:06:10.379
Hilarious.

01:06:11.447 --> 01:06:13.449
"Who is Taylor?"

01:06:13.482 --> 01:06:15.850
Straight to the point.
You gotta love her.

01:06:15.884 --> 01:06:17.152
Okay, I gotta...

01:06:17.186 --> 01:06:18.220
<i>Okay, bye!</i>

01:06:19.455 --> 01:06:20.922
- Straight to voicemail.
- Oh, shit.

01:06:22.023 --> 01:06:24.859
Let me see.

01:06:24.893 --> 01:06:28.197
All right. "Don't call
me. Who is Taylor?"

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:30.232
Okay. Let's not panic.

01:06:30.266 --> 01:06:31.300
Let's not panic.
Take a deep breath.

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:32.234
Okay, okay.

01:06:32.268 --> 01:06:35.170
You just gotta tell her
who Taylor is, okay?

01:06:35.204 --> 01:06:37.273
And Taylor is, uh...
She's a stand-up comic.

01:06:37.306 --> 01:06:38.873
You're right!
Facts, facts, okay.

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:40.041
Type that, type that!

01:06:40.074 --> 01:06:41.843
She's a comic.

01:06:44.846 --> 01:06:45.747
What is she saying?

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.115
I don't know but
she's saying somethin'.

01:06:47.148 --> 01:06:48.317
The little message bubbles
popping up.

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:49.485
- She's saying somethin'.
- I can't stand

01:06:49.518 --> 01:06:50.519
- the message bubbles.
- Yeah, me neither.

01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:52.153
I don't want nobody to know
when I'm typing shit.

01:06:52.188 --> 01:06:53.322
Invasion of privacy.
I don't even like it.

01:06:53.355 --> 01:06:55.056
Yeah. Right?

01:06:55.089 --> 01:06:56.292
Are you...

01:06:56.659 --> 01:06:57.959
Are you...

01:06:57.992 --> 01:06:59.060
"Are you fucking her?"

01:06:59.093 --> 01:07:01.029
Because of me,
you can answer that question honestly.

01:07:01.062 --> 01:07:02.096
You're right.
'Cause I didn't.

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:03.265
You did not.

01:07:03.299 --> 01:07:05.434
- I was good. Chastity belt, nigga!
- Come on.

01:07:05.467 --> 01:07:07.135
- Let her know.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:07:07.168 --> 01:07:08.204
No.

01:07:11.873 --> 01:07:13.275
"So why she calling you

01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:14.976
"a 'cutie at
work' for no reason?"

01:07:15.009 --> 01:07:16.945
Let me get that.

01:07:16.978 --> 01:07:19.147
I don't know
who she thinks I am.

01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:20.482
Okay. So you're
keeping it vague.

01:07:20.516 --> 01:07:22.050
- Yeah.
- That's nice, that's nice.

01:07:23.219 --> 01:07:24.353
"Don't be vague with me."

01:07:24.386 --> 01:07:27.055
Sky's smart as fuck though.

01:07:28.224 --> 01:07:30.091
"What are you really
doing out there?"

01:07:30.925 --> 01:07:32.927
Because I'm trying to...

01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:35.096
I'm out here
trying to make moves.

01:07:35.129 --> 01:07:36.465
Why can't you believe that?

01:07:39.368 --> 01:07:40.469
She answering?

01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:44.005
Well, nah, not yet.

01:07:45.307 --> 01:07:47.041
But the bubbles
are popping up again

01:07:47.075 --> 01:07:49.478
for the messages,
so, you know.

01:07:49.511 --> 01:07:51.145
So, just gonna...
Come on.

01:07:53.948 --> 01:07:55.284
Mmm? Mmm?

01:07:56.485 --> 01:07:58.487
What the fuck, man?
Is she writing a novel?

01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.521
What the fuck?
I don't know, man.

01:07:59.555 --> 01:08:01.423
But she better hurry up.
My phone about to die.

01:08:01.457 --> 01:08:02.458
God damn.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.493
"If you say so"?

01:08:04.526 --> 01:08:05.827
- And that's it?
- Yeah.

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.296
But the message bubbles,
they was...

01:08:07.329 --> 01:08:08.830
Man, you know what?
Fuck it, man.

01:08:08.863 --> 01:08:10.432
Been blowing me off
since I left the house.

01:08:10.466 --> 01:08:12.334
I don't even know
if we still together.

01:08:12.368 --> 01:08:14.068
I ain't gonna worry
about this. Ha!

01:08:14.102 --> 01:08:15.136
Big dog.

01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:17.904
Ain't gonna run
my blood pressure up.

01:08:19.308 --> 01:08:22.544
You know what?
Nah, I need to go ahead and see.

01:08:22.578 --> 01:08:24.212
Anticipation is gonna
drive me insane!

01:08:24.246 --> 01:08:25.447
I'm just gonna call her.

01:08:25.481 --> 01:08:27.448
Okay? Deep breath.

01:08:32.086 --> 01:08:34.256
Hi, baby.

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:37.158
So, maybe you should just
give me a call, huh?

01:08:37.925 --> 01:08:39.261
Huh, you know how...

01:08:39.295 --> 01:08:40.995
You know how things
get lost in translation

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:42.298
when you sendin' messages.

01:08:42.331 --> 01:08:44.566
My phone's about to die,

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.368
but I'm at the new hotel
in West Hollywood...

01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:49.970
uh, room 945.

01:08:50.004 --> 01:08:51.340
Give me a call.

01:08:51.372 --> 01:08:54.042
I love you. Baby.

01:08:55.511 --> 01:08:56.877
Give me the phone.

01:08:56.911 --> 01:08:58.212
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:08:58.247 --> 01:09:00.249
- Since when you start...
- Wait. She's typing something.

01:09:00.282 --> 01:09:02.384
Hmm? What's it say?

01:09:04.118 --> 01:09:05.254
"Fuck you."

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.154
Clear as day.

01:09:07.555 --> 01:09:08.624
I told you.

01:09:14.929 --> 01:09:15.997
So, check,
I had an audition

01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:17.064
- the other day, right?
- Uh-huh.

01:09:17.098 --> 01:09:20.001
I'm no Meryl Streep
but people know me.

01:09:20.033 --> 01:09:22.304
The first thing they
asked me is how many likes

01:09:22.337 --> 01:09:24.273
do I have on my Instagram.

01:09:24.305 --> 01:09:25.374
They got
these Instagram stars.

01:09:25.407 --> 01:09:26.475
They got
maybe three minutes...

01:09:26.508 --> 01:09:27.576
Spotify?

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:29.077
Spotify is music, man.
It ain't that.

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:31.212
Whatever the hell it is,
they got it.

01:09:31.246 --> 01:09:32.080
At least know
what the damn thing is.

01:09:32.113 --> 01:09:33.081
See, that's why
you not in the game.

01:09:33.113 --> 01:09:34.216
You don't even know what it is.

01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:37.252
You know what Instagram
used to be? On the street...

01:09:37.286 --> 01:09:39.053
"Hey, I heard that bitch
is funny. Go see her."

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:39.921
That was it.

01:09:39.953 --> 01:09:41.390
And you know
what a phone used to be?

01:09:41.423 --> 01:09:42.558
That was somebody
who was gonna kill you,

01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:43.925
or a sexual predator.

01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:45.627
That's what I like.

01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:48.529
I can't allow these
internet up-and-comers

01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:51.332
to just come in
and start regulating.

01:09:51.367 --> 01:09:53.067
I don't understand
what they've done.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.404
If that means I gotta
go back on the road,

01:09:55.437 --> 01:09:57.004
then we'll make it
on the road.

01:09:57.038 --> 01:09:58.106
That's right.

01:09:58.139 --> 01:09:59.040
I ain't mad at you.

01:09:59.073 --> 01:09:59.941
I stay on the road.
I live on the road.

01:09:59.974 --> 01:10:01.410
These kids don't wanna
be on the road.

01:10:01.443 --> 01:10:02.511
They wanna get famous.

01:10:02.544 --> 01:10:03.479
Now.

01:10:03.512 --> 01:10:05.280
I don't understand
how they're in our lane.

01:10:05.314 --> 01:10:07.081
We're not in their lane.

01:10:07.115 --> 01:10:09.251
- That's all I'm saying.
- You don't get it. When we were young,

01:10:09.284 --> 01:10:10.619
they thought
we were crazy.

01:10:10.652 --> 01:10:13.121
But, no, that was 1906,
when you was young.

01:10:13.154 --> 01:10:14.556
You shut the fuck up.

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.157
You've got to listen
these days.

01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:17.593
Young kids can
learn from you.

01:10:17.626 --> 01:10:19.026
You can learn from them.

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:19.994
How you gonna listen?

01:10:20.027 --> 01:10:21.062
The kid that you're having
a problem with,

01:10:21.095 --> 01:10:22.297
maybe you should become
his friend, be his ally.

01:10:22.331 --> 01:10:26.435
You never know. He might be
the next big thing coming up.

01:10:26.468 --> 01:10:28.537
Hey, Marques, you haven't been
on the road in about 10 years.

01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:31.172
It's gonna be so epic.
First of all, you write your stuff up,

01:10:31.206 --> 01:10:32.474
you go in the clubs,
and they go...

01:10:32.508 --> 01:10:34.942
"Ooh! There's a Marques sighting.
Ooh!" And they show up.

01:10:34.976 --> 01:10:37.212
And get the little internet kids.
Matter of fact, use them.

01:10:37.246 --> 01:10:38.647
Use them to
help you go viral.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.382
That's what I'm telling you!
Didn't I say that?

01:10:40.416 --> 01:10:41.350
No, you ain't
say it that way.

01:10:41.383 --> 01:10:42.551
I'm doing a better way
than what you said.

01:10:42.584 --> 01:10:46.288
Let them make you viral too.
Let them make you viral too.

01:10:46.321 --> 01:10:47.689
Them young kids know
how to do that shit.

01:10:47.723 --> 01:10:51.326
Y'all used to go together?
'Cause y'all acting like two bitches.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.661
- Did you call me a bitch?
- Yes.

01:10:52.694 --> 01:10:55.230
I can't call you bitch,
because calling you bitch is wrong.

01:10:55.264 --> 01:10:56.331
No, call me a bitch.

01:10:56.365 --> 01:10:57.433
If we put this
on the internet,

01:10:57.466 --> 01:10:58.600
we could be viral.

01:10:58.634 --> 01:11:01.203
You know what? Where is
my chicken wings? God damn it!

01:11:01.236 --> 01:11:02.671
Look, y'all gonna take care
of the check?

01:11:02.704 --> 01:11:03.938
- What?
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:11:03.971 --> 01:11:05.741
I just turned down 20 million.
Y'all know I ain't got it.

01:11:05.774 --> 01:11:07.074
Yes, yes. We got you.

01:11:07.108 --> 01:11:08.210
Hey, Sinbad,
where you going?

01:11:08.243 --> 01:11:09.211
To pay the check.

01:11:09.244 --> 01:11:11.647
We've talked
to Thomas's parents,

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.047
and they just want an apology

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.082
from Jaylin
for his part in all of this.

01:11:15.116 --> 01:11:16.452
Yes, he'll apologize.

01:11:17.519 --> 01:11:18.520
No, I won't.

01:11:19.788 --> 01:11:20.988
Excuse me?

01:11:21.022 --> 01:11:25.126
I'm not sorry I fought him.
He was talking mess about dad.

01:11:25.159 --> 01:11:26.528
Saying that
he doesn't have money

01:11:26.562 --> 01:11:27.696
and that he's a loser...

01:11:27.729 --> 01:11:29.598
and that he's never
gonna give me a piano.

01:11:30.599 --> 01:11:32.534
Jaylin, he might not, sweetie.

01:11:32.568 --> 01:11:34.670
You just don't
believe in him.

01:11:34.703 --> 01:11:36.170
You think I don't believe
in your father?

01:11:37.372 --> 01:11:39.541
You didn't want him
to go to LA.

01:11:39.575 --> 01:11:40.676
You don't know
what he's doing out there.

01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:42.478
He's doing
what he said he would.

01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:44.279
He's following his dreams.

01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:48.250
Look, I'm sorry. If we
could just get back to...

01:11:48.283 --> 01:11:49.785
Of course, hold on.

01:11:49.818 --> 01:11:52.187
Jaylin, do you think
I believe in you?

01:11:54.723 --> 01:11:57.992
I do. I believe
in the both of you.

01:12:03.632 --> 01:12:05.634
Jaylin's not apologizing.

01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:07.503
And, you know,
maybe instead of asking my son

01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:09.471
to apologize
for defending his father,

01:12:09.505 --> 01:12:11.038
you should talk
to the other kid

01:12:11.072 --> 01:12:13.408
about disrespecting
Jaylin's dad.

01:12:13.442 --> 01:12:16.311
When Thomas is ready
to apologize to my son,

01:12:16.845 --> 01:12:18.313
you know where we are.

01:12:18.347 --> 01:12:19.381
Come on, baby,
let's bounce.

01:12:21.283 --> 01:12:22.384
That was so dope.

01:12:22.417 --> 01:12:23.585
I know, right?

01:12:23.619 --> 01:12:24.786
So, we're just
gonna walk out?

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.556
Yes, and then I'm going
to see your daddy.

01:12:27.589 --> 01:12:29.358
You want some ice cream?

01:12:32.594 --> 01:12:34.496
<i>Pee-wee
Herman just got busted</i>

01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:38.165
<i>for jacking off
in a porno theater.</i>

01:12:42.604 --> 01:12:44.506
<i>Didn't you think jacking off</i>

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.508
<i>and porno theater
went together</i>

01:12:46.542 --> 01:12:48.477
<i>like a unspoken marriage?</i>

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:49.778
<i>That's like saying,</i>

01:12:49.811 --> 01:12:52.347
<i>"He ordered fries,
and he ate them too."</i>

01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:54.449
<i>"Did he? What a monster."</i>

01:12:54.483 --> 01:12:55.751
<i>You feel something sticky
on the floor,</i>

01:12:55.784 --> 01:12:57.286
<i>that's probably not popcorn.</i>

01:12:57.319 --> 01:12:59.254
<i>You should just walk
a little faster.</i>

01:13:02.558 --> 01:13:04.626
I was pretty good,
wasn't I?

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.428
Marques to go.

01:13:08.664 --> 01:13:10.299
Mr. Black.

01:13:10.332 --> 01:13:13.535
I have a Mr. McDonald here
to see you.

01:13:13.569 --> 01:13:15.136
Mr. McDonald?

01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:16.338
Thank you, Alfred.

01:13:16.371 --> 01:13:19.341
- That's Alfred. What's up, man?
- You for real?

01:13:19.374 --> 01:13:21.643
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

01:13:21.677 --> 01:13:24.580
Oh, no problem.
Is that a golden microphone?

01:13:24.613 --> 01:13:28.317
Sure is. Marques has used
it in every one of his shows

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:31.520
since his first
big concert special.

01:13:31.553 --> 01:13:33.188
<i>Marques Black Uncensored.</i>

01:13:33.221 --> 01:13:34.423
Yeah, I might have
seen that one.

01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:36.558
You might have
seen that?

01:13:36.592 --> 01:13:39.661
Yeah, okay.
Everybody's seen it.

01:13:39.695 --> 01:13:40.762
Yeah, everybody.

01:13:40.796 --> 01:13:42.431
I'm gonna leave
you two alone.

01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:43.665
I'll be damned.

01:13:43.699 --> 01:13:44.800
Come on, boy.

01:13:45.867 --> 01:13:47.569
Let's go outside.

01:13:47.603 --> 01:13:48.604
Sure.

01:13:51.873 --> 01:13:53.742
Gave that $20 million back.

01:13:53.775 --> 01:13:55.344
What you do that for?

01:13:55.377 --> 01:13:57.245
Well,
'cause you were right.

01:13:57.279 --> 01:13:59.214
I lost sight of myself
just focusing

01:13:59.247 --> 01:14:01.283
on making that money.

01:14:01.316 --> 01:14:03.385
Forgot I was being
who they wanted me to be,

01:14:03.418 --> 01:14:04.886
instead of who I truly am.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.457
Well, I'm glad I could
teach you something, playboy.

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:12.461
Yeah, well, I don't mind
learning from my mistakes.

01:14:12.494 --> 01:14:14.363
Speaking of mistakes...

01:14:14.396 --> 01:14:16.163
I should've been
the bigger person

01:14:16.198 --> 01:14:18.700
in this situation we got here.

01:14:18.734 --> 01:14:21.470
You young,
rough around the edges,

01:14:21.503 --> 01:14:23.305
but you're talented.

01:14:23.338 --> 01:14:24.740
And I could've
been helping you,

01:14:24.773 --> 01:14:26.942
instead of trying
to destroy you.

01:14:26.975 --> 01:14:28.110
Listen, man,
no offense. Thanks.

01:14:28.142 --> 01:14:30.545
But, listen, I'm not your little
project, all right?

01:14:30.579 --> 01:14:33.782
I'll get to where I
need to be on my own.

01:14:33.815 --> 01:14:35.784
Yeah, well, see,
when I was breaking in

01:14:35.817 --> 01:14:37.452
we had to learn
from the greats.

01:14:37.486 --> 01:14:39.187
I had to learn
from Redd Foxx.

01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:40.822
I had to learn
from Richard Pryor.

01:14:40.856 --> 01:14:42.591
I was out there fetching
Eddie Murphy's coffee.

01:14:42.624 --> 01:14:44.292
Well, look, it's a new day.

01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:45.694
It's a new time,
it's a new era.

01:14:45.727 --> 01:14:48.296
Ain't nobody gonna be
shining your damn shoes.

01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:50.365
I get all the views
I need to get

01:14:50.399 --> 01:14:52.234
on this thing right here.

01:14:52.267 --> 01:14:56.405
So you don't need us
'cause you got followers?

01:14:56.438 --> 01:14:57.572
Exactly.

01:14:59.408 --> 01:15:00.776
Look, you gotta
look to your past

01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:02.611
to understand
your future, young blood.

01:15:02.644 --> 01:15:06.481
I am the future, old man.

01:15:12.521 --> 01:15:16.558
You're scared.
That's what it is.

01:15:16.591 --> 01:15:19.695
Finally. I couldn't figure
out what was really going on,

01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:23.498
but that's what's
behind the arrogance,

01:15:23.532 --> 01:15:25.934
and the angry rants about me.

01:15:25.967 --> 01:15:27.636
This is all some

01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:29.971
"fight the biggest dude
on the yard...

01:15:30.005 --> 01:15:33.408
"so everybody doesn't
see how scared I am."

01:15:33.442 --> 01:15:36.778
Listen, man,
I definitely ain't scared.

01:15:41.917 --> 01:15:45.387
I know fear,
and it's all in your eyes.

01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:47.556
Yeah.

01:15:47.589 --> 01:15:50.559
And what you're really
scared of is failure.

01:15:50.592 --> 01:15:52.360
'Cause you convinced
everybody

01:15:52.394 --> 01:15:54.463
around you
to believe in you,

01:15:54.496 --> 01:15:57.432
and you don't believe
in yourself.

01:15:57.466 --> 01:15:58.700
You know what? We'll see
who's scared,

01:15:58.734 --> 01:16:00.368
when I win
that showcase tonight.

01:16:01.336 --> 01:16:02.704
We'll see who's scared then.

01:16:05.373 --> 01:16:07.642
If you was
who you saying you were,

01:16:07.676 --> 01:16:10.278
you wouldn't give a fuck
about a showcase.

01:16:15.984 --> 01:16:17.953
But, uh...

01:16:17.986 --> 01:16:20.455
But don't be late for
your little showcase, playboy.

01:16:20.489 --> 01:16:21.990
Good luck out there.

01:16:55.423 --> 01:16:57.692
All right, Dre. I'm leaving
you another message, dawg.

01:16:57.726 --> 01:17:00.662
How the fuck are you gonna be
late to your own showcase?

01:17:00.695 --> 01:17:03.331
You got to get here, man,
before you fuck up my whole plan.

01:17:03.365 --> 01:17:04.866
No management company,
no Sarah Silverman,

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.334
no nothing, dawg.

01:17:06.368 --> 01:17:08.770
Come on, man,
this is very black of you.

01:17:08.804 --> 01:17:10.739
Where the fuck have you been?

01:17:10.772 --> 01:17:11.973
I don't even know.

01:17:12.007 --> 01:17:13.575
I don't even know
how to explain it.

01:17:13.608 --> 01:17:14.876
Dre, are you high?

01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:16.711
- Huh?
- You look high. Are you high?

01:17:16.745 --> 01:17:17.913
No, I don't think so.

01:17:17.946 --> 01:17:20.949
Oh, my fucking God, dawg.
Come on, man. Get it together.

01:17:20.982 --> 01:17:23.051
McDonald, you're up.

01:17:23.084 --> 01:17:24.853
- Okay.
- All right, this is it, baby.

01:17:24.886 --> 01:17:27.722
Look, I'm live-streaming
this whole round.

01:17:27.756 --> 01:17:29.124
Been promoting it all day.

01:17:29.157 --> 01:17:31.059
Everybody is gonna be watching,
so you know what you've got to do.

01:17:31.092 --> 01:17:32.694
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?

01:17:32.727 --> 01:17:34.429
Boom! Kill it!

01:17:34.462 --> 01:17:35.597
Let's do this.

01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:36.731
Let's go,
let's go. I'm ready.

01:17:36.765 --> 01:17:38.099
- Do your thing, baby.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:38.133 --> 01:17:39.401
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:39.434 --> 01:17:40.468
What's up, Dre?

01:17:40.502 --> 01:17:41.670
- What up, bruh?
- You all right?

01:17:41.703 --> 01:17:43.438
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
- Do your shit, bruh.

01:17:43.471 --> 01:17:45.073
Fo' sho. Fo' sho.

01:17:59.688 --> 01:18:01.756
It's my time, motherfucker.

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:03.124
Let's go.

01:18:06.928 --> 01:18:08.630
<i>Glad I'm not
in this competition.</i>

01:18:08.663 --> 01:18:10.765
<i>I'd be back there scared.</i>

01:18:10.799 --> 01:18:12.567
<i>Y'all ready
for another comedian?</i>

01:18:12.601 --> 01:18:14.603
<i>Well, let's bring him up.</i>

01:18:14.636 --> 01:18:17.839
<i>Put your hands together
for Deandre.</i>

01:18:28.783 --> 01:18:30.485
<i>Oh, man.</i>

01:18:30.518 --> 01:18:34.055
<i>What a day. What a day.
What a day. What a day.</i>

01:18:34.389 --> 01:18:36.691
<i>Um...</i>

01:18:36.725 --> 01:18:39.494
<i>Uh...</i>

01:18:39.527 --> 01:18:44.432
<i>I just came from
Marques Black's house.</i>

01:18:44.466 --> 01:18:48.436
<i>Did I say house? I meant
to say palatial estate.</i>

01:18:49.571 --> 01:18:51.973
<i>Marques Black's house
is so big</i>

01:18:52.007 --> 01:18:54.910
<i>this motherfucker has slaves.</i>

01:18:54.943 --> 01:18:57.846
<i>Like, I seen
three niggas picking cotton.</i>

01:18:57.879 --> 01:19:01.983
<i>Like, what the fuck is this?
Where is Quentin Tarantino?</i>

01:19:02.017 --> 01:19:06.087
<i>Is this fucking</i> Django?
<i>What is happening?</i>

01:19:06.121 --> 01:19:08.556
<i>I'm saying, look...
And this is not even the set</i>

01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:10.525
<i>that I was normally
gonna do, all right?</i>

01:19:10.558 --> 01:19:13.028
<i>I mean, usually I would've worked
this shit out in my journal,</i>

01:19:13.061 --> 01:19:17.233
<i>but I just came from Marques
fucking Black's house</i>

01:19:17.266 --> 01:19:19.668
<i>and honest to God,
I'm still trying to process this shit.</i>

01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:21.469
<i>So if I could
work it out with y'all,</i>

01:19:21.503 --> 01:19:22.971
<i>I would love to.
Is that cool?</i>

01:19:23.004 --> 01:19:25.106
<i>All right.</i>

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.641
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:19:26.675 --> 01:19:28.076
Hey, can I go talk to him
for a second

01:19:28.109 --> 01:19:29.678
and find out
what's going on?

01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:32.248
Sorry. The clock's
already started.

01:19:32.281 --> 01:19:34.950
<i>Me and Marques Black got this
internet beef going, man.</i>

01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:36.985
<i>And I done talked
shit about him.</i>

01:19:37.018 --> 01:19:40.822
<i>I talked about his movies.
I talked about his height.</i>

01:19:40.855 --> 01:19:42.991
<i>I done talked
about everything, man.</i>

01:19:43.024 --> 01:19:45.126
<i>And you know what, man?
Marques Black, even though,</i>

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.629
<i>even though his movies
are trash as fuck...</i>

01:19:47.662 --> 01:19:50.098
<i>uh, he's cool as hell.</i>

01:19:50.131 --> 01:19:52.600
<i>Got a cool house,
with cool shit.</i>

01:19:52.634 --> 01:19:55.737
<i>He's got a solid gold
microphone in a case.</i>

01:19:55.770 --> 01:20:00.242
<i>A solid gold microphone?
The fuck?</i>

01:20:00.276 --> 01:20:04.112
<i>Like, yo, God don't even
use a solid gold microphone.</i>

01:20:04.145 --> 01:20:07.015
<i>God's microphone he uses
to talk to us is gold-plated.</i>

01:20:07.048 --> 01:20:09.851
<i>He got
a solid gold microphone.</i>

01:20:09.884 --> 01:20:11.220
<i>What the hell, man?</i>

01:20:11.253 --> 01:20:13.989
<i>So he's talking to me
about being great, right?</i>

01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:17.726
<i>And he tells me
that I'm scared of failure.</i>

01:20:17.759 --> 01:20:21.129
<i>And I was like,
"Wow! Scared of failure."</i>

01:20:21.162 --> 01:20:23.531
<i>Who says that to somebody?</i>

01:20:23.565 --> 01:20:25.066
<i>I wanted to be like...</i>

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:28.770
<i>"Nigga, how did you know
I was scared of failure?"</i>

01:20:28.803 --> 01:20:30.939
<i>Nah, but you know I ain't
say that. I ain't say that.</i>

01:20:30.972 --> 01:20:32.241
<i>You know, 'cause
I'm tough. I'm a man.</i>

01:20:32.274 --> 01:20:33.641
<i>Had to put on
that tougher side.</i>

01:20:33.675 --> 01:20:36.278
<i>So, I was like, "Man,
what the hell are you talking about?</i>

01:20:36.312 --> 01:20:38.013
<i>"Ain't nobody
fucking scared.</i>

01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:40.115
<i>"I ain't scared.
What? What?</i>

01:20:41.716 --> 01:20:43.252
<i>"Let me
tell you something, bruh.</i>

01:20:43.285 --> 01:20:44.320
<i>"Let me tell you something.
Let me tell you something, little buster.</i>

01:20:44.353 --> 01:20:46.322
<i>"Let me tell you something,
little buster."</i>

01:20:46.355 --> 01:20:47.722
<i>He said I don't believe
in myself.</i>

01:20:47.756 --> 01:20:49.057
<i>I wanted to look at him
and be like,</i>

01:20:49.090 --> 01:20:50.925
<i>"Who keeps telling you
all these secrets?</i>

01:20:50.959 --> 01:20:52.694
<i>"Are you a spirit
whisperer?</i>

01:20:52.727 --> 01:20:54.330
<i>"How do you know this shit?"</i>

01:20:54.363 --> 01:20:55.864
<i>And nobody ever tells you</i>

01:20:55.897 --> 01:20:57.333
<i>when you go
to Marques Black's house</i>

01:20:57.366 --> 01:20:59.667
<i>that he gonna give you
a divine intervention, right?</i>

01:20:59.701 --> 01:21:00.769
<i>Look, they need
to tell you that</i>

01:21:00.802 --> 01:21:03.138
<i>before you drop your keys
off to his valet.</i>

01:21:03.171 --> 01:21:06.641
<i>At his house, 'cause he got
a valet at his fucking house.</i>

01:21:06.674 --> 01:21:08.843
<i>And the valet be looking at
you, talking about some...</i>

01:21:08.877 --> 01:21:10.779
<i>"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"</i>

01:21:10.812 --> 01:21:12.614
<i>This old-ass nigga
about 200 years old.</i>

01:21:12.647 --> 01:21:15.750
<i>"Hey, be careful.
That nigga know your heart."</i>

01:21:15.784 --> 01:21:18.119
<i>Like, huh, what the fuck?</i>

01:21:18.153 --> 01:21:19.821
<i>He knows my heart.
Is he Jesus or something?</i>

01:21:19.854 --> 01:21:21.323
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:21:21.357 --> 01:21:23.058
<i>Look, man. My girl, man...</i>

01:21:23.091 --> 01:21:25.126
<i>My girl is
the fucking best, man.</i>

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.928
<i>I can understand
why she's frustrated.</i>

01:21:26.961 --> 01:21:28.696
<i>You know, 'cause
I'm out here talking about</i>

01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:30.165
<i>I'm chasing my dreams.</i>

01:21:30.199 --> 01:21:32.368
<i>I ain't chasing shit.</i>

01:21:32.401 --> 01:21:34.836
<i>Really. I'm just doing
free internet videos</i>

01:21:34.869 --> 01:21:38.039
<i>and beefing
with celebrities for free.</i>

01:21:38.073 --> 01:21:40.008
<i>Meanwhile, she got a check.</i>

01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:41.343
<i>And she taking care
of the house,</i>

01:21:41.377 --> 01:21:42.777
<i>taking care of our kid,</i>

01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:44.313
<i>trying to further
better herself.</i>

01:21:44.346 --> 01:21:47.148
<i>You know what I'm saying?
Just being an adult.</i>

01:21:47.183 --> 01:21:50.085
<i>And I'm just out here
doing stupid shit, man.</i>

01:21:50.118 --> 01:21:54.323
<i>Our relationship is synonymous
to Jay-Z and Beyonce.</i>

01:21:54.356 --> 01:21:57.025
<i>If Beyonce would've
married DMX.</i>

01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.528
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

01:21:59.562 --> 01:22:02.964
<i>I'm like, "Hey, yo!
Hey, yo! Hey, baby!</i>

01:22:02.997 --> 01:22:04.233
<i>"Hello!</i>

01:22:05.767 --> 01:22:07.168
<i>"Baby, baby,
can I get some money?</i>

01:22:07.203 --> 01:22:08.803
<i>"Can I get
some allowance money</i>

01:22:08.837 --> 01:22:10.171
<i>"so I can do
my few dumb videos?</i>

01:22:10.206 --> 01:22:12.841
<i>"I mean, even though it's free
and it's coming out of you,</i>

01:22:12.874 --> 01:22:14.809
<i>"please help out me, boo."</i>

01:22:17.346 --> 01:22:18.746
<i>I love her.</i>

01:22:20.081 --> 01:22:23.685
<i>We expect a woman to accept
us for all our bullshit.</i>

01:22:23.718 --> 01:22:25.887
<i>I mean,
so much bullshit, too.</i>

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:30.725
<i>We talking about... We talking about
joblessness, womanizing, poverty.</i>

01:22:30.758 --> 01:22:32.794
<i>Meanwhile, as soon as
she does that, what we do?</i>

01:22:32.827 --> 01:22:35.830
<i>Leave her for a chick
with a fatter ass.</i>

01:22:35.864 --> 01:22:38.367
<i>And it don't even got to be
really much that fatter.</i>

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.003
<i>It's just the margin of one
percent of a fatter ass.</i>

01:22:42.036 --> 01:22:43.372
<i>That shit could
change an election.</i>

01:22:43.405 --> 01:22:44.873
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

01:22:44.906 --> 01:22:46.442
<i>Just that one fucking percent.</i>

01:22:46.475 --> 01:22:48.377
<i>I'll be sitting with my girl
sometimes and I'll be like,</i>

01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:50.145
<i>"What the fuck
are you doing here?</i>

01:22:50.179 --> 01:22:52.113
<i>"You can do
way better than me.</i>

01:22:52.147 --> 01:22:53.249
<i>"Do you believe in yourself?</i>

01:22:53.282 --> 01:22:56.352
<i>"I believe you can get
in a better relationship.</i>

01:22:56.385 --> 01:22:57.919
<i>"Maybe we need
to talk to Marques Black</i>

01:22:57.952 --> 01:22:59.087
<i>"to have an intervention</i>

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.422
<i>"cause I don't know
what the fuck</i>

01:23:00.456 --> 01:23:02.790
<i>"you are doing here
with me right now."</i>

01:23:02.824 --> 01:23:05.194
<i>But you know what, folks?
It's not supposed to be easy.</i>

01:23:05.227 --> 01:23:07.196
<i>'Cause if it's easy,
it's not worth it.</i>

01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:10.131
<i>You feel me? That's why
I'm so hard on my girl.</i>

01:23:10.165 --> 01:23:12.234
<i>'Cause I'm worth it.
You know what I'm saying?</i>

01:23:12.268 --> 01:23:14.035
<i>Nah, I'm just fucking
with y'all.</i>

01:23:14.068 --> 01:23:18.440
<i>Baby, please go out there
and find your damn Jay-Z.</i>

01:23:18.474 --> 01:23:21.876
<i>Because DMX still got
some soul-searching to do.</i>

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:23.711
<i>You know what I mean, nigga?</i>

01:23:23.745 --> 01:23:24.946
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

01:23:24.979 --> 01:23:27.115
<i>I'm Deandre McDonald.
That's my time.</i>

01:23:27.148 --> 01:23:29.451
<i>Thank y'all so much.
Appreciate it.</i>

01:23:29.485 --> 01:23:31.187
<i>Thank you, man.</i>

01:23:39.961 --> 01:23:41.230
- Dre! Dre!
- Yo!

01:23:41.263 --> 01:23:42.298
The fuck was that, man?

01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:43.765
I had some shit I had
to get off my chest, man.

01:23:43.798 --> 01:23:44.999
That shit was lit, baby.

01:23:45.033 --> 01:23:46.202
Yeah, I'll call my baby up.

01:23:46.235 --> 01:23:47.436
- Come on, go ahead, go ahead.
- Cool, cool.

01:23:47.469 --> 01:23:48.736
I'll record it.

01:23:50.972 --> 01:23:52.774
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

01:23:52.807 --> 01:23:56.010
Baby, hit me back.
Baby, I did it.

01:23:56.044 --> 01:23:57.179
I killed it.
I got a standing O

01:23:57.213 --> 01:23:58.480
talkin' about my shit.

01:23:58.514 --> 01:24:01.383
I can't believe it.
I fucking did it!

01:24:01.417 --> 01:24:03.918
Okay, hit me back.
Soon as you can.

01:24:03.952 --> 01:24:05.987
All right? I love you.
All right.

01:24:07.088 --> 01:24:08.790
- Bruh...
- Dawg...

01:24:08.823 --> 01:24:10.892
- What? What? What?
- Did you hear 'em?

01:24:10.925 --> 01:24:12.494
Come on, man, let's go.

01:24:18.833 --> 01:24:21.370
<i>All right,
all right, all right.</i>

01:24:21.403 --> 01:24:24.072
<i>Look, when I call your name,
please step forward.</i>

01:24:25.106 --> 01:24:26.874
<i>DeJuan Bickerstaff.</i>

01:24:26.908 --> 01:24:28.377
That's what I told ya!

01:24:34.148 --> 01:24:35.783
<i>Montana Prestley.</i>

01:24:43.259 --> 01:24:44.360
<i>LaMont Keish.</i>

01:24:50.199 --> 01:24:51.933
<i>And last but not least...</i>

01:24:57.406 --> 01:25:00.074
<i>Paul Wilds!</i>

01:25:09.218 --> 01:25:11.019
Hey, excuse me?
Excuse me? Judge?

01:25:11.052 --> 01:25:12.153
He should be
in the next round, man.

01:25:12.187 --> 01:25:13.355
You heard the crowd.
They love him.

01:25:13.389 --> 01:25:16.090
Yeah, he was hilarious,
and we did too.

01:25:16.124 --> 01:25:17.025
But apparently he took money

01:25:17.058 --> 01:25:20.229
while he was performing
in the showcase.

01:25:20.262 --> 01:25:23.931
Taylor Jones. Look, man, I didn't get
money for her showcase, all right?

01:25:23.965 --> 01:25:25.601
She just gave us money
for food.

01:25:25.634 --> 01:25:27.001
Well, if there's
a misunderstanding,

01:25:27.035 --> 01:25:28.136
you should take it up
with her.

01:25:28.169 --> 01:25:30.838
Round three starts
in, uh, two hours.

01:25:34.876 --> 01:25:36.245
What the fuck?

01:25:36.278 --> 01:25:38.213
- To us.
- Wait.

01:25:38.247 --> 01:25:40.582
Why is Taylor talking
to Marques' manager,

01:25:40.616 --> 01:25:42.318
your mortal enemy?

01:25:42.351 --> 01:25:43.519
So we're working together?

01:25:43.552 --> 01:25:44.653
Something ain't
right about this.

01:25:44.687 --> 01:25:46.921
I think I know what exactly
isn't right about this.

01:25:46.954 --> 01:25:49.291
You do? Like,
you figured it out already?

01:25:49.325 --> 01:25:50.592
God damn! You quick, bruh.

01:25:50.626 --> 01:25:53.262
A show coming up.
That's right. Oh.

01:25:53.295 --> 01:25:54.929
Taylor.

01:25:54.962 --> 01:25:56.097
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:25:56.130 --> 01:26:00.336
It is the internet kid,
everyone.

01:26:00.369 --> 01:26:02.571
You and Marques set me up.

01:26:02.604 --> 01:26:05.139
How'd you do? Did you win
that little contest?

01:26:05.173 --> 01:26:07.509
No, I didn't win,
'cause she played me.

01:26:07.543 --> 01:26:10.078
Look, it wasn't personal,
all right?

01:26:10.111 --> 01:26:13.147
He offered me representation
if I helped him.

01:26:13.182 --> 01:26:14.283
You know what, Taylor?

01:26:14.316 --> 01:26:17.219
<i>You know damn well I didn't
get paid to be in your show.</i>

01:26:17.252 --> 01:26:20.121
<i>Oh. Was that how
she pulled it off?</i>

01:26:20.154 --> 01:26:22.291
<i>I never got the details.</i>

01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:25.327
<i>But I like it.</i>

01:26:25.361 --> 01:26:27.995
Turn the car around, please.

01:26:28.029 --> 01:26:29.298
<i>Look, I'm sorry, Dre.</i>

01:26:29.331 --> 01:26:30.965
<i>He's gonna
help me break in.</i>

01:26:30.998 --> 01:26:32.668
<i>Right, Nico?</i>

01:26:32.701 --> 01:26:36.338
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll put in some calls,

01:26:37.339 --> 01:26:39.408
but, uh,
I can't promise nothing.

01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:41.008
But you said that you...

01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:44.546
Hold on. Yo, what's good?
Hold on for a minute.

01:26:45.447 --> 01:26:47.416
Hey, uh, McDonald. Uh...

01:26:47.783 --> 01:26:49.518
It's over.

01:26:49.551 --> 01:26:51.953
Have a safe,
safe flight back home.

01:26:51.986 --> 01:26:55.257
And next time
you're out here,

01:26:55.290 --> 01:26:57.693
be careful
who you fuck with.

01:26:57.726 --> 01:27:00.128
You know what?
I'm tripping.

01:27:00.161 --> 01:27:01.963
There probably won't be
a next time.

01:27:03.565 --> 01:27:05.467
And, um, take her with you.

01:27:06.301 --> 01:27:07.536
Yeah?

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.007
Hope it was worth it.

01:27:18.112 --> 01:27:20.249
And we keeping the $20.

01:27:25.119 --> 01:27:27.256
Live-streaming that
show killed my battery.

01:27:27.289 --> 01:27:28.557
Dre, I gotta crick in my neck

01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:30.325
from sleeping
in a fucking minivan.

01:27:30.359 --> 01:27:33.195
I got it, I got it.

01:27:33.228 --> 01:27:35.531
- Go, go, go.
- God damn!

01:27:38.099 --> 01:27:39.100
Wait.

01:27:40.502 --> 01:27:41.703
Baby...

01:27:41.737 --> 01:27:43.505
Oh! Mmm.

01:27:43.539 --> 01:27:44.706
Mmm.

01:27:46.241 --> 01:27:47.443
Mmm.

01:27:47.476 --> 01:27:49.378
Damn, baby...

01:27:49.411 --> 01:27:51.246
Wait a minute now.
What's up with this?

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.449
What you doing here, baby?
Where's Jaylin?

01:27:53.482 --> 01:27:54.383
With my mom.

01:27:54.416 --> 01:27:56.485
Baby, I saw the show.
You were amazing.

01:27:56.518 --> 01:27:58.554
So funny and honest.

01:27:58.587 --> 01:27:59.621
Stop.

01:27:59.655 --> 01:28:02.191
It's not just about me,
and it should never be.

01:28:02.224 --> 01:28:04.426
Baby, I've been
so caught up

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.696
on what I want that I ain't
even consider what you need.

01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:09.498
Well, I've been
so in my feelings,

01:28:09.531 --> 01:28:12.201
it's been hard for me
to have faith in your vision.

01:28:12.234 --> 01:28:15.370
But I do.
Baby, you are so talented.

01:28:15.404 --> 01:28:18.005
You're doing exactly
what you should be.

01:28:18.039 --> 01:28:20.576
Well, I'm done
with all that.

01:28:20.609 --> 01:28:22.411
I ain't cut out for this.

01:28:22.444 --> 01:28:24.078
No, I know
you're not giving up.

01:28:24.111 --> 01:28:25.681
Not after everything
we done been through.

01:28:25.714 --> 01:28:28.717
Boy, the Dre I know
would never quit.

01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:30.352
Not the Dre I know.

01:28:30.385 --> 01:28:32.187
He quit tee-ball,
junior varsity basketball.

01:28:32.221 --> 01:28:34.055
Veganism. That lasted a day.

01:28:34.088 --> 01:28:35.089
Mind your business!

01:28:35.457 --> 01:28:36.558
Yep.

01:28:36.592 --> 01:28:37.793
I got disqualified
from the showcase.

01:28:37.826 --> 01:28:39.160
What am I supposed to do?

01:28:39.194 --> 01:28:42.397
Figure it out.
You always do.

01:28:42.431 --> 01:28:46.435
Hell, as long as you get back
at that shady-ass Nico.

01:28:46.468 --> 01:28:48.804
Wait, how'd you know
Nico was shady?

01:28:48.837 --> 01:28:51.105
- It was on the livestream.
- It was?

01:28:51.138 --> 01:28:53.509
Yes, and all that stuff
about Taylor.

01:28:53.542 --> 01:28:56.411
Matter of fact, fuck that bitch
for trying to sabotage you.

01:28:56.445 --> 01:28:57.479
Wait, wait, wait.

01:28:57.513 --> 01:28:59.146
She ain't even cute,
to be honest.

01:28:59.181 --> 01:29:01.283
Whoa, the whole Nico
conversation was on livestream?

01:29:01.316 --> 01:29:03.552
Mmm-hmm. Now, stop saying his
name, 'cause he's dead to me.

01:29:03.585 --> 01:29:07.121
That's the proof I need
to show that I was set up.

01:29:07.154 --> 01:29:09.224
Eddie, you recorded
that livestream, right?

01:29:09.258 --> 01:29:10.459
What am I,
a amateur live-streamer?

01:29:10.492 --> 01:29:11.760
Yeah, I recorded that shit.

01:29:11.793 --> 01:29:13.328
If I can get that footage
to the judges,

01:29:13.362 --> 01:29:15.096
they gotta let me back
in the showcase.

01:29:15.129 --> 01:29:16.798
We only got, like, an hour
before the final round starts.

01:29:16.832 --> 01:29:18.233
Not without us.

01:29:18.267 --> 01:29:19.368
Look at us,
out in these streets.

01:29:19.401 --> 01:29:20.536
Let's go!

01:29:20.569 --> 01:29:22.804
Yo, hey, wait,
look at us. Huh?

01:29:22.838 --> 01:29:25.240
We running around
Hollywood and shit.

01:29:25.274 --> 01:29:26.642
Just want y'all to know
I love y'all.

01:29:26.675 --> 01:29:28.577
What you want?
A Drake compilation album

01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:30.279
to go with that damn
speech of yours?

01:29:30.312 --> 01:29:31.580
It got real sugary up in here.

01:29:31.613 --> 01:29:32.748
Right, right.

01:29:32.781 --> 01:29:35.149
Baby, baby. Baby, look.

01:29:35.183 --> 01:29:36.251
I've been a idiot,

01:29:36.285 --> 01:29:37.686
but you're the only
one for me.

01:29:37.719 --> 01:29:39.288
Oh, baby,
I know.

01:29:39.321 --> 01:29:40.756
I'm fine as hell.

01:29:40.789 --> 01:29:42.591
You are. You gonna get it
when we get back.

01:29:42.624 --> 01:29:44.293
After you
win the showcase.

01:29:44.326 --> 01:29:46.228
Damn right. Let's go.

01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:49.264
<i>Welcome to the final round of
the LOL Comedy Showcase.</i>

01:29:49.298 --> 01:29:52.234
<i>Now, one of these comedians
are going on a 30-city tour.</i>

01:29:52.267 --> 01:29:53.869
<i>That's right.
A 30-city tour.</i>

01:29:53.902 --> 01:29:55.504
<i>Now, without
any further ado...</i>

01:29:55.537 --> 01:29:56.705
Damn, man.
They already started.

01:29:56.738 --> 01:29:58.607
No, no, no. You know what?
I got this.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.375
Everybody, get down!

01:30:00.409 --> 01:30:02.244
Oh, my God! He got a gun!
Take my money!

01:30:02.277 --> 01:30:03.178
What they doing?

01:30:03.211 --> 01:30:04.613
You can't say "get down"
in LA, dumbass.

01:30:04.646 --> 01:30:05.714
Why not?

01:30:05.747 --> 01:30:06.782
Because they'll think
you got a gun.

01:30:06.815 --> 01:30:07.816
Why would I have a gun?

01:30:07.849 --> 01:30:10.686
I was trying to tell
the comedians to get down

01:30:10.719 --> 01:30:12.854
'cause I want my boy,
Deandre, to get on the stage.

01:30:12.888 --> 01:30:14.456
<i>You know damn well</i>

01:30:14.489 --> 01:30:15.857
<i>I didn't get paid
to be in your show.</i>

01:30:15.891 --> 01:30:17.192
Wait a second!
Don't boo!

01:30:17.225 --> 01:30:18.393
You need to show him
the video of Nico.

01:30:18.427 --> 01:30:19.528
What if they don't
believe me?

01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:20.796
Oh, shit!

01:30:20.829 --> 01:30:22.831
Who's that?

01:30:31.373 --> 01:30:32.507
You look good, baby!

01:30:33.508 --> 01:30:35.310
You the man, Marques!

01:30:35.344 --> 01:30:37.144
<i>Thank you, everybody.
I appreciate it.</i>

01:30:37.179 --> 01:30:39.146
<i>I appreciate it. I do.</i>

01:30:39.181 --> 01:30:42.284
<i>Uh, this is an interruption,
and I'm sorry for that.</i>

01:30:42.317 --> 01:30:44.486
<i>But somebody
was disqualified earlier</i>

01:30:44.519 --> 01:30:46.388
<i>and they should not have been.</i>

01:30:46.421 --> 01:30:48.724
<i>And so I came
to make this right.</i>

01:30:48.757 --> 01:30:50.726
<i>It's my pleasure
to introduce a guy</i>

01:30:50.759 --> 01:30:52.327
<i>who is not just a friend,</i>

01:30:52.361 --> 01:30:53.795
<i>but may one day
be my successor,</i>

01:30:53.829 --> 01:30:55.263
<i>if he doesn't fuck this up.</i>

01:30:55.297 --> 01:30:58.567
<i>Please give it up for Deandre
McDonald, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:30:59.835 --> 01:31:01.637
You got this, baby.

01:31:08.777 --> 01:31:10.412
Go, Dre!

01:31:13.415 --> 01:31:15.183
I don't know what to say.

01:31:15.651 --> 01:31:17.185
Just be great.

01:31:20.355 --> 01:31:21.490
Let's go.

01:31:27.496 --> 01:31:28.630
<i>Well...</i>

01:31:30.832 --> 01:31:34.336
<i>I got a golden
microphone, bitch!</i>

01:31:42.511 --> 01:31:43.712
Then all the kids
started bragging about

01:31:43.745 --> 01:31:44.913
who's coming to see them
at the recital.

01:31:44.946 --> 01:31:46.014
Oh, yeah?

01:31:46.048 --> 01:31:50.185
Yeah. Mom, do you think
Dad will be home by then?

01:31:52.387 --> 01:31:53.555
It's a tough one, baby.

01:31:53.588 --> 01:31:55.791
He's got a lot of
days left on his tour.

01:31:56.825 --> 01:31:58.427
Are you hungry?

01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:01.263
I can make you something.
Your favorite.

01:32:01.296 --> 01:32:02.464
Mmm. Okay.

01:32:06.368 --> 01:32:07.536
Come on.

01:32:10.338 --> 01:32:11.907
Dre?

01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:13.775
- For real?
- Dad?

01:32:20.782 --> 01:32:22.651
- You got me a piano?
- Yeah!

01:32:22.684 --> 01:32:25.387
That's you and that's yours.
I bought that.

01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.588
Love you, Jaylin.

01:32:26.621 --> 01:32:28.023
Love you too, Dad.

01:32:28.056 --> 01:32:29.391
Yeah!

01:32:29.424 --> 01:32:30.459
Baby...

01:32:34.996 --> 01:32:36.398
Uh-huh.

01:32:39.568 --> 01:32:41.536
You don't know how to do
nothing like that.
