10:15.397 --> 10:17.225
is the hotel's
video surveillance.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.531
I told you, that place has a
very high-security firewall.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.185
It would take days
to break through.

10:21.229 --> 10:23.057
Well, that's why we've just got
to go down there and get it.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.755
But how? You're not a cop.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.801
Yeah, and I have a feeling
that they're not just gonna

10:27.844 --> 10:29.367
hand it over if you go
there and ask nicely.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.413
No, you're probably right.

10:31.456 --> 10:34.459
But I think I have an idea.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.115
[line ringing]

10:38.159 --> 10:39.421
HIGGINS:
Hello.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.205
Higgy, it's Magnum.

10:41.249 --> 10:44.078
Uh, how do you feel
about being my wife?

10:48.996 --> 10:51.694
Must we really walk
arm-in-arm?

10:51.738 --> 10:54.610
Y-Yes. Well, you want them
to buy it, don't you?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.308
Aloha. Welcome to the
Maika'i Hotel and Spa.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.483
How may I help you?

10:58.527 --> 11:00.311
Hi there, Philip.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.052
Uh, me and my lovely wife here
have a reservation

11:02.096 --> 11:04.707
under Sam Marlowe.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.187
[typing]

11:06.230 --> 11:07.492
PHILIP:
Hmm.

11:07.536 --> 11:10.191
I don't see any reservation
under that name.

11:10.234 --> 11:13.716
Well, there must be
some kind of mistake.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.631
We made the reservation
months ago.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.459
[American accent]:
Um, Philip,

11:17.502 --> 11:20.070
if you could just do me a favor
and would you just check again?

11:20.114 --> 11:22.203
There must be some
kind of a mix-up.

11:22.246 --> 11:25.728
I mean,
it's-it's our anniversary.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.122
I'm sorry, but, uh,
it's not here.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.254
Wait. Okay, hold up.

11:30.298 --> 11:33.214
Are you saying a reservation
that I made three months ago

11:33.257 --> 11:34.389
somehow just vanished?

11:34.432 --> 11:36.434
HIGGINS:
Honey, calm down.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.740
I'm sure that they can, uh,

11:37.784 --> 11:39.133
still accommodate us,
right, Philip?

11:39.176 --> 11:40.961
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but it's just that

11:41.004 --> 11:42.658
the International Pet Food
Convention's in town

11:42.702 --> 11:44.051
and we're completely
booked up.

11:44.094 --> 11:47.315
The International
Pet Food Convention?

11:47.358 --> 11:48.795
Are you kidding me?

11:48.838 --> 11:50.579
We-we flew 15 hours from Omaha

11:50.622 --> 11:52.059
to get here to celebrate
our anniversary,

11:52.102 --> 11:54.191
and now you're kicking us out
on the street

11:54.235 --> 11:55.845
because some International

11:55.889 --> 11:57.281
Pet Food Convention is
happening? That's crazy.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.892
HIGGINS:
Honey, relax.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.242
It's-it's not good for your
blood pressure.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.809
I want to talk
to the manager,

12:02.852 --> 12:05.812
Mr. Akamu; I made
my reservation with him,

12:05.855 --> 12:08.336
and he promised me not only that
the suite would be ready,

12:08.379 --> 12:10.468
but that there'd be rose petals
scattered from the doorway

12:10.512 --> 12:12.949
to the bedroom,
just like I asked.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.299
I'm sorry, babe, that was
supposed to be a surprise.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.475
Aw... rose petals?

12:17.519 --> 12:19.390
Honey, that's so romantic.I know, it's really...

12:19.434 --> 12:20.435
I know.

12:20.478 --> 12:21.828
Akamu, of course.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.090
One second.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.181
Okay, do your thing.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.620
Nice American accent,
by the way.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.013
HIGGINS [normal voice]:
There's nothing nice about
an American accent.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.843
Wish me luck.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.372
AKAMU: Mr. Marlowe?Yes.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.895
I'm Akamu.Mm.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.115
I understand we have an issue.Yeah.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.812
Yeah, there's an issue.
My wife's in the ladies room

12:49.856 --> 12:51.205
crying her eyes out right now.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.816
You know, I'm a verified user
on Yelp

12:53.860 --> 12:56.993
with 714 reviews,
and I have never,

12:57.037 --> 13:00.301
okay, not once,
left a one-star review.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.693
Don't make me start today.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.960
Not only that,

13:07.003 --> 13:10.180
I have almost 10,000 followers
on Twitter.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.313
I don't want to leave a review
talking about this clusterfudge.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.794
I want to talk about how
spectacular this place is,

13:14.837 --> 13:17.013
how attentive the staff can be,

13:17.057 --> 13:18.885
the food, the-the spa,
the services.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.234
Like, all that stuff.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.018
And we all want that, too.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.852
It seems we actually have
a last-minute cancellation.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.811
Okay.
It's not the room
you booked

13:31.854 --> 13:33.421
but it does have an ocean view.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.379
I like ocean.
Plus,

13:35.423 --> 13:37.468
I can give you a voucher
for two free nights

13:37.512 --> 13:39.601
in our fabulous honeymoon suite

13:39.644 --> 13:41.472
to be redeemed at
a later date.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.518
Would that be satisfactory?

13:43.561 --> 13:46.042
You know what, Akamu?

13:46.086 --> 13:50.525
This is the kind of service
I expect from the Maika'i Hotel.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.222
You just earned yourself
five stars, buddy.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.484
Thank you, sir.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.921
Thank you.
You, too, Philip.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.748
I'm going to go
tell my wife.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.664
They bolted right
after midnight.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.884
I'll check the cameras by
the lobby elevator and stairs.

14:01.928 --> 14:05.192
MAGNUM:
Uhp, there. Took the
service elevator down.

14:05.235 --> 14:08.499
It looks like they're headed
for the parking garage.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.024
RICK:
Terrific.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.895
No clear shot
of their faces.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.723
It's like they knew where
the cameras were.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.986
Could've done some recon
beforehand.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.206
RICK:
Ah, getaway car.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.860
They had a wheelman.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.383
HIGGINS: Right.[typing]

14:27.910 --> 14:30.870
The vehicle is registered to
a Terry Kanarot.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.872
His address is in Mililani.
450 Coral Road.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.658
MAGNUM:
Let's go.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.546
[quietly]:
You find him?

14:55.590 --> 14:57.766
You don't have to whisper.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.134
TC:
Damn.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.745
RICK:
Is that the money?

15:20.789 --> 15:24.053
Nah. It's just
the personal stuff.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.316
Wallets,
phones, watches.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.971
This one here is,
uh, Mike Davis.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.104
Then that must be Terry.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.844
You think the guy that was
driving turned on these guys

15:32.888 --> 15:34.150
and split with the cash?

15:34.194 --> 15:35.717
Maybe.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.200
Or it was whoever told them
about the poker game.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.813
Your boy's eyes are closed.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.336
You're gonna have to
pry 'em open

15:46.380 --> 15:47.816
if you want that to work.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.994
I'm gonna go ahead
and call "not it."

15:52.038 --> 15:53.996
Yeah. TC and I
found this place, man.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.345
I... I think it's all you.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.003
RICK:
You guys are such candy-asses.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.094
There you go.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.661
[sighs]

16:06.704 --> 16:07.575
Okay, this is interesting.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.706
What you got?

16:08.750 --> 16:10.447
Terry was texting

16:10.491 --> 16:12.014
with a guy named Charley Franks
immediately before

16:12.058 --> 16:14.016
and after the robbery,

16:14.060 --> 16:16.236
saying, "Almost at the door."

16:16.279 --> 16:17.367
"Keep the engine running."

16:17.411 --> 16:18.760
Terry was giving Franks
updates.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.588
So this Franks could be
the wheelman.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.373
Maybe. If he is,
we got to find him.

16:23.417 --> 16:24.853
Go through that, see if there's
anybody connected to the game.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.466
No, it doesn't look like it.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.207
They got a tip from somebody.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.906
What?

16:36.734 --> 16:39.215
Okay. Just... just hear me out.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.087
Theoretically,

16:41.130 --> 16:44.742
Toni could have told these two
guys about the game, right?

16:44.786 --> 16:47.528
Oh, come on. You crazy? Toni?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.138
You said it yourself.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.053
Her brother needs care.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.447
A big score like that
could help.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.144
Yeah, but she was already
taking a rake.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.624
What is it, five percent?

16:56.667 --> 16:58.234
Toni's not gonna rip off
her own game.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.149
I don't know, man.
You'd be surprised

17:00.193 --> 17:01.846
what people would do for family.

17:01.890 --> 17:05.024
Hey, you don't know her, okay?[phone ringing]

17:07.026 --> 17:09.419
Hey.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.638
All right, stay there.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.292
Stay there, I'll be right over.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.641
Is there a problem?

17:13.684 --> 17:14.946
Yeah. It's, uh, it's Toni.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.861
I got to go over there.She okay?

17:16.905 --> 17:18.080
Not really.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.168
Should we come?

17:19.212 --> 17:22.171
No. No. Y-You just...

17:22.215 --> 17:23.999
you go and make sure you find
that Franks guy.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.132
[sighs]

17:26.175 --> 17:27.959
I don't think he wanted
to hear that about Toni.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.918
Yeah.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.138
So what do we do
with these two stiffs?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.276
[horn honks]

17:47.979 --> 17:50.504
Pascale's crew do this?

17:50.547 --> 17:54.595
If they were sending a message,
I heard it loud and clear.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.380
This is all my fault.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.382
No, it's not.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.644
No, it is.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.385
I'm the one that
roped in Pascale.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.085
What? What is it?

18:06.128 --> 18:08.478
I'm thinking I should just get
on the next flight off-island.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.654
You're gonna run?

18:10.698 --> 18:12.265
What choice do I have?

18:12.308 --> 18:13.614
I promise, we're gonna find
the money.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.703
Odds are you won't.

18:15.746 --> 18:16.965
No, that's not true.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.662
No, we got a lead
and it's a good one.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.142
The guys are working
on it right now.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.274
Running is
the safe move here.

18:27.062 --> 18:28.237
Were you in on this?

18:30.326 --> 18:31.501
What?

18:31.545 --> 18:32.807
Just answer the question.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.243
Were you involved in this
in any way?

18:34.287 --> 18:36.332
In the robbery?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.117
How could you even ask me that?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.814
Your brother needs money
right now.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.424
100% is better than five.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.644
Are you serious?

18:43.687 --> 18:45.950
Look, those guys didn't just
stumble onto that game.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.343
Somebody told them about it.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.432
Somebody gave them
the time and the place.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.782
And you think that
didn't occur to me?

18:51.826 --> 18:54.350
I've been asking myself,
was it Liko, was it my dealer

18:54.394 --> 18:55.960
who could've talked?

18:56.004 --> 18:58.311
But you have to believe me,
I had nothing to do with this.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.704
Look, I want to believe you,
but I...
Forget it, Rick.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.315
I don't want to talk anymore.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.099
Hey, hey, hey.
Listen, listen.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.535
Don't leave.
Don't leave.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.581
Look.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.366
You. Me. This.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.020
This...

19:12.063 --> 19:13.891
This could be something.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.461
Come on, tell me
you don't feel it, too.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.290
Tell me you feel something.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.726
I'm-I'm really
putting myself out here.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.295
I do.

19:29.559 --> 19:32.780
Look, I know you're scared,
but you got to trust me.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.434
And if we don't find
the money,

19:34.477 --> 19:36.175
I'll be on that flight with you.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.089
You can't mean that.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.178
Why not?

19:44.357 --> 19:47.577
MAGNUM: TC and I went by
Charley Franks' apartment.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.231
Place was empty,
but we talked to a neighbor

19:49.275 --> 19:51.233
who saw Charley leaving
this morning with a backpack

19:51.277 --> 19:52.887
and overnight bag.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.324
My guess is our wheelman's
gonna lay low for a bit.

19:55.368 --> 19:56.978
And I think I might know where.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.415
So you think we're gonna find
him over there?

19:59.459 --> 20:02.157
Mm. I know this might sound
crazy but I've had my fair share

20:02.201 --> 20:04.464
of skip traces, and
more than half the time

20:04.507 --> 20:07.336
they're hiding out
at their mom's place.

I'm about to head out
to a crime scene in Mililani.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.086
Two bodies at a house.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.653
You know anything about that?

20:19.696 --> 20:21.176
No, I-I can't say I do.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.699
Magnum,

20:22.743 --> 20:24.919
you know they record those
anonymous tip lines, don't you?

20:24.962 --> 20:26.312
And you know

20:26.355 --> 20:28.009
I know your voice, right?

20:28.052 --> 20:30.011
Uh, yeah, yeah.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.360
No, I-I...

20:31.404 --> 20:33.754
I called it in, all right?
You got me.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.277
Great. Want to explain
how you ended up

20:35.321 --> 20:37.192
at a crime scene
with two dead bodies?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.282
Uh, you know, I'd love to,
but I'm on a case right now.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.980
But I promise you I-I
will fill you in later.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.721
I'm gonna check out
this crime scene,

20:44.765 --> 20:46.419
but after that,
you're gonna tell me everything.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.432
What's that for?

20:59.475 --> 21:01.434
Just follow my lead.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.218
I don't know, man.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.003
This Charley guy looks like he
grew up in a nice neighborhood.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.441
Patriotic family.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.007
Yeah, how'd he get involved
in something like this?Yeah.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.749
Good question.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.800
Hi. Can I help you gentlemen?

21:19.843 --> 21:22.019
You're not here to sell
me something, are you?

21:22.063 --> 21:24.283
Mm, no, ma'am. We're
actually census takers.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.548
Uh, but the census isn't
for another two years.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.201
Just getting
an early jump on it.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.856
A lot of people to count.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.685
So, it says here, uh,

21:35.729 --> 21:37.644
Charley Franks resides
at this address.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.602
Uh, can I talk to him?

21:39.646 --> 21:40.864
That can't be right.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.779
Charley has his own place.

21:42.823 --> 21:45.304
So... Charley's not here?

21:45.347 --> 21:47.393
No. Sorry.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.655
So nobody else resides here?

21:48.698 --> 21:50.483
No, just me.

21:50.526 --> 21:53.355
Oh. Who's the other pair
of slippers for?

21:53.399 --> 21:55.488
Uh, those.

21:55.531 --> 21:56.967
They're mine.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.317
[chuckles]:

A lot of people ask me

22:16.117 --> 22:17.553
why I choose to drive
Robin Masters' car

22:17.597 --> 22:19.207
instead of getting
one of my own.

22:19.250 --> 22:22.906
Easy. Zero to 100
in just 2.9 seconds.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.441
Thomas, I-I think
he's gonna hit us, man.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.356
MAGNUM:
Nah, he's gonna stop.

22:37.399 --> 22:40.271
That's easy for you
to say-- if we get T-boned,
I'm the one getting boned!

22:40.315 --> 22:42.230
Come on, man, do something!
Quit playing, man!

22:46.582 --> 22:48.845
See? Told you he
was gonna stop.

22:48.889 --> 22:49.977
I hate you.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.766
Got the money.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.028
Who are you guys?

22:58.072 --> 22:59.856
He's a private investigator,

22:59.900 --> 23:02.468
and I'm... I guess
you could say I'm the muscle.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.470
[panting]: I thought
maybe you were the guys

23:04.513 --> 23:05.949
that killed
Terry and Mike.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.124
Oh, so you didn't kill them?

23:07.168 --> 23:08.909
What? No way, man.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.519
Okay, so there's two dead guys,
and you got

23:10.563 --> 23:12.434
the money they stole--
you tell me how that looks.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.393
Yeah. But I didn't kill them.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.003
Look, when I got
to Terry's place this morning,

23:16.046 --> 23:17.526
they were already dead.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.093
I just saw the money there,
and I grabbed it.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.225
So somebody else killed them

23:21.269 --> 23:23.532
and left that big wad
of cash behind?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.491
Good luck selling HPD on that.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.971
It's the truth.
I'd never betray
those guys.

23:28.015 --> 23:30.931
So if you didn't kill them,
who did?I don't know.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.628
And who told them
about the poker game?

23:32.672 --> 23:34.195
I don't know
that, either.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.762
Look, they didn't
tell me much.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.546
Terry just, he...
he asked for my help,

23:37.590 --> 23:38.504
and I said okay.

23:38.547 --> 23:39.896
Just like that?

23:39.940 --> 23:41.594
He was a good guy.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.030
Mike, too.

23:43.073 --> 23:45.206
Look, I get how it looks,
but it's the truth.

23:45.249 --> 23:48.252
My older brother served
with them.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.341
2nd Ranger Battalion.
He was KIA.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.301
Terry and Mike brought
his body back,

23:53.344 --> 23:55.042
so my mom and I
could give him a proper burial.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.394
I owed those guys.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.483
I would've done whatever
they asked, no questions.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.877
And besides,

24:03.920 --> 24:06.488
Terry... he said he
was doing it for a good reason.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.795
He said he was doing it
for his family,

24:08.838 --> 24:10.492
and it wasn't about money.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.983
All right, I checked out the
crime scene. Now it's your turn.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.680
How the hell'd you
get onto a double murder?

24:24.724 --> 24:27.291
I was investigating a robbery.

24:27.335 --> 24:29.859
The two vics ripped off
a friend of mine last night.

24:29.903 --> 24:30.686
You sure about that?

24:30.730 --> 24:32.296
100%.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.821
Well, I'm finding that
a little hard to believe.

24:34.864 --> 24:35.822
Why?

24:35.865 --> 24:36.910
We ran both of them.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.086
Terry Kanarot and Mike Davis

24:39.129 --> 24:40.217
were decorated former soldiers.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.784
Both served with distinction.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.526
Both had good jobs,
stable lives.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.962
Is that right?

24:46.006 --> 24:47.268
Any idea who killed them?

MAGNUM:
My little voice is telling me

24:51.490 --> 24:53.143
that Charley
is telling the truth,

24:53.187 --> 24:55.537
which means I've got
a choice here: tell Katsumoto

24:55.581 --> 24:57.713
about him, or leave him out
of it and cross my fingers

24:57.757 --> 25:00.499
that I'm not letting
a killer off the hook.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.066
No, I don't... I don't know.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.546
Sorry.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.548
I have to talk to the M.E.

25:06.592 --> 25:09.638
But I want to see you
in my office in two hours.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.771
You're gonna walk me
through every step of
your investigation.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.036
Well, Charley,

25:16.079 --> 25:17.777
looks like it's
your lucky day.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.301
We're gonna take this,

25:20.344 --> 25:22.042
try not to mention
your name to HPD.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.260
In the meantime,

25:23.304 --> 25:24.479
lay low, all right?

25:24.523 --> 25:25.480
Whoever killed

25:25.524 --> 25:26.960
Terry and Mike
might want

25:27.003 --> 25:29.136
to try and tie up
some loose ends.

I got it.
Thank you.

25:31.442 --> 25:32.487
Let's get out of here.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.575

for this money.

Now all I got to do is
text Pascale

25:52.855 --> 25:55.205
and tell him
we have his money.

25:55.249 --> 25:59.209

but I am beat.

sitting on ice in the morgue.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.717
Yeah, that's true.

I mean, HPD's on it,
though, right?

26:30.806 --> 26:33.113
I don't get it.
They-they served with honor,

26:33.156 --> 26:34.767
they had great jobs,
and then they suddenly decide

26:34.810 --> 26:37.334
to break bad and-and pull off
a robbery like this?

26:37.378 --> 26:38.466
It just doesn't
make sense.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.641
Well, Charley said that
they did it

26:39.685 --> 26:41.991
for a good reason, right?

26:42.035 --> 26:43.427
That it was about family.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.081
Maybe that's where
the answer lies.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.431
He also said
it wasn't about money.

26:47.475 --> 26:51.087
Maybe they were
after something else.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.306
What do you mean,
"something else"?

26:52.349 --> 26:53.786
Well...

26:57.050 --> 27:01.141
...money wasn't the only thing
they stole at the poker game.

after the keys,

27:17.940 --> 27:19.986
and they-they stole everything
else to cover it up?

27:20.029 --> 27:21.770
And then they
killed those guys

27:21.814 --> 27:23.337
to get the keys back.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.948
And that explains
the left-behind money.

I don't know, Thomas.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.777

a reach to me, man.

You know, Icepick said
something to me earlier.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.001
He said,
"You don't rob a poker game

27:35.044 --> 27:36.089
until the end of the night."

27:36.132 --> 27:37.699
These guys didn't do that.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.006
That tells me money
wasn't the priority.MAGNUM: Exactly.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.485
They were after the keys.

27:41.529 --> 27:44.053
Okay, so who do the keys
belong to?

27:44.097 --> 27:45.881
Whoever it is, they're
probably the killer, right?

Let's see, uh, who was

What's his story?

27:53.802 --> 27:55.499

27:55.543 --> 27:58.198
He owns some sort
of employment agency.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.590
Agro Workforce Solutions.
Something like that.

27:59.634 --> 28:01.114

What can you tell me
about Russell Chang?

Why are you asking?

Chang guy, then what?

what's in there

And he wouldn't tell us why,

Chang's main business

is recruiting workers
from foreign countries,
