11:28.062 --> 11:30.439
[inhales deeply] Oh, she crazy.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.441
[laughs and gasps]

11:32.525 --> 11:33.943
Yeah, she real crazy.

11:35.027 --> 11:35.903
[clears throat]

11:38.656 --> 11:39.740
"Upshaw".

11:40.866 --> 11:41.992
[tapping nails]

11:44.286 --> 11:46.080
What the hell is wrong with you?

11:46.163 --> 11:47.623
You see me.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.043
What? I like to keep my shit professional.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.046
Okay. So, would you like some water?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.756
[sighs] Not thirsty.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.675
-Are you hungry?
-Brought my own.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.843
[inaudible]

11:59.677 --> 12:04.849
So, if you want to try
something kind of fun,

12:04.932 --> 12:06.684
I got a whole bag of burgundy hair.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.478
-Like things the way they are.
-Oh.

12:09.562 --> 12:13.524
It's your hair. I'm just saying if you
wanna try to switch things up.

12:13.607 --> 12:17.361
No, you have switched things up
enough in my life, thank you.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.113
[sighs]

12:19.196 --> 12:25.536
You know, you have had a stank attitude
ever since you walked through my door.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.873
Oh, believe me, I didn't wanna be
walking through your door today.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.083
You don't have to be here. You called me.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.253
[chuckles] We don't need to talk.

12:34.336 --> 12:35.796
No problem.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.257
Let me get you out of here real quick.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.341
Thank you.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.219
[chuckling]

12:42.303 --> 12:43.387
Girl, I'm just playing.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847
Girl, I'm not laughing.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.806
[sighs]

12:45.890 --> 12:48.267
[funky instrumental music playing]

12:50.060 --> 12:51.687
Hey! What you doing?

12:52.688 --> 12:56.442
I'm out with my friends, we're in the car,
and we're across state lines.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.111
What does it look like I'm doing, dummy?

12:59.195 --> 13:02.156
You don't have to be mean.
I was gonna offer to help you.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.157
Oh.

13:03.657 --> 13:04.533
That's what's up.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.036
Well, when you finish this basket,

13:07.119 --> 13:10.456
this pile goes in Mom's closet
and those go in Dad's corner.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.460
I meant together. Like, we hang out.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.419
Oh.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.923
All right.
Well, I already started this pile.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.091
So, it's mine. You can start another one.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.639
So, what's the tea?

13:28.474 --> 13:29.475
I got nothing.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.269
Well, I heard Mom's making
pork chops for dinner.

13:32.353 --> 13:36.106
[gasps] Wow, keep folding while I process.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.860
Oh, that's nothing. I got lots of dirt.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.279
Maya, what the hell?
That took me, like, forever.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.656
It was an accident.

13:43.739 --> 13:46.909
Leave me alone. It's your fault
I have to do this in the first place.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.079
If you hadn't called Aunt Lucretia,
no one would have known I left you.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.123
-I needed coffee!
-You're seven.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.084
That's why I didn't know how to make it.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.586
I'm not doing this with you.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.047
You never do anything with me anymore.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.257
'Cause you're a baby.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.635
If you don't wanna be around me,
then I don't wanna be around you.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.513
That's literally what I'm asking for.
[clicks tongue]

14:08.889 --> 14:09.723
[Maya] Wait.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.767
You really don't want to be around me?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.019
[sighs]

14:14.103 --> 14:16.272
[funky instrumental music playing]

14:16.355 --> 14:19.483
What's it called when
you have three nines and two tens?

14:20.359 --> 14:22.570
Stop playing. You know it's a full house.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.364
Oh. Well, I have four kings.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.658
You a lucky-ass leprechaun!

14:28.409 --> 14:32.204
Just for that, you'll be coming in
at the top of the morning, me laddie.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.998
[scoffs] Top of the morning?

14:34.081 --> 14:37.918
All I got to do is beat Bennie here.
I don't have to leave my house till noon.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.336
[both laughing]

14:39.420 --> 14:42.172
[fake laughing]
I'll slap the shit out of you, Tony.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.842
Damn, bro. Where'd that come from?

14:44.925 --> 14:47.136
Someone woke up and chose violence today.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.054
If I was you, I would've woke up

14:49.138 --> 14:53.350
and chose to be in that shop
when it caught on fire. [laughing]

14:53.434 --> 14:55.978
What? Lucretia ain't the only one
who got jokes.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.313
Yeah, but she ain't mean.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.772
There's a lightness to her.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.524
I am a treasure.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.027
Somebody should bury you.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.195
Alive.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.406
[laughing]

15:07.489 --> 15:10.576
What? Laugh. It's a joke. What's going on?

15:10.659 --> 15:12.369
Another soldier down.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.122
I'll take another one, boss.
As long as they're still free.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.042
Well, they gotta be free. I broke you.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.710
[laughing]

15:19.793 --> 15:22.296
Oh, God. I love her.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.007
You gonna be out of a job.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.554
You gotta go. Uh-uh. Let's go. Wrap it up.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.599
Not while there's still
a dime left in your pocket.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.894
No, I'm sick of you all up in my life.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.688
You do it in my house.
You come between me and Regina.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.942
-You got something to say.
-No, you treat Regina like shit.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.818
I make her stand up for herself.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.779
Well, we saying the same thing.

15:47.821 --> 15:51.241
-Now you turning my boys against me.
-I'm fun. Sue me.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.370
Your so-called boy already is.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.290
Naw, we ain't gonna talk about
that ungrateful bastard right now.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.209
I'm pretty sure we are.

16:01.251 --> 16:05.547
You ain't mad about no poker game.
All this displaced anger.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.758
Oh, now you wanna come
between me and my anger?

16:07.841 --> 16:09.426
Your problem isn't with me.

16:09.510 --> 16:15.099
Your problem is that Davis is suing you
because you're an asshole and you know it.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.394
The man fell, Lucretia.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.853
The man fell on the ground.

16:19.937 --> 16:24.149
He's not suing you because he fell.
He's suing you because you hurt his pride.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.152
Davis don't have nothing
to be proud of, Lucretia.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.239
-See? That. That right there.
-No! I'm just telling the truth.

16:30.322 --> 16:34.910
No… That. That's it. Your friend fell
and all you did was clown him.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.537
The jokes keep coming.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.330
[laughing] What am I supposed to do?

16:40.207 --> 16:43.544
And all your little jokes
is gonna cost us the shop.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.088
And I'm not going to let that happen.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.674
So you need to man up,

16:48.757 --> 16:52.970
get out your little feelings
and go be a real friend and end this.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.181
-[Bennie] Uh-huh.
-[clicks tongue] Make me sick.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.935
[funky instrumental music playing]

17:00.644 --> 17:02.646
Okay, Mama. Enjoy your soak.

17:04.314 --> 17:07.401
Can't believe she took
my lavender bath bomb.

17:08.235 --> 17:10.195
She knew damn well I was saving that.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.449
[knocking at door]

17:19.329 --> 17:20.247
Lucretia?

17:20.873 --> 17:24.418
You are taking a chance coming to the door
without your leg brace on.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.836
Oh, it's itchy.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.047
[scoffs] Let me close this
in case they're watching.

17:28.130 --> 17:28.964
Who's watching?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.133
Look, if Bennie sent you--

17:31.216 --> 17:33.218
No. No one knows I'm here.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.179
I came for you.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.599
You should know my mama's upstairs.
She'll hear a gun go off.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.853
You're too jumpy.
Can we talk limp-to-limp?

17:43.645 --> 17:45.647
I know after my fall, I was miserable.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.441
Oh, I'm hanging in there.

17:47.524 --> 17:50.736
No, no, no. Mama said those chairs
are just for looking.

17:52.362 --> 17:56.241
Well, I gotta tell you,
you are a tougher man than me.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.412
My lawsuit was hell.
And I had to do all that rehab.

18:00.496 --> 18:04.875
Oh, no. Mama called the pastor
to lay hands on me. I'll just heal.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.586
That's not good enough for the lawyers.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.214
They gonna make you
jump through all kinds of hoops.

18:10.297 --> 18:14.343
Doctor visits, physical therapy
four times a week,

18:14.426 --> 18:16.095
surgeries.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.805
-Surgery.
-Oh, yeah.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.932
Law says they got to cut you.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.351
I mean, if you want the big money.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.437
But first they gonna make you lose weight.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.232
I hope you like broth.
Your mama can make broth right?

18:28.315 --> 18:30.442
I do most of the cooking around here.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.945
Well, I'm sure
your friends will drop some off.

18:33.028 --> 18:33.862
Well, I mean,

18:34.363 --> 18:36.865
not the guys
at the shop, obviously. [scoffs]

18:36.949 --> 18:38.242
Them days are over.

18:38.784 --> 18:42.246
Bennie and I have gotten into it before.
He'll get over it.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.456
You'll meet some new friends at rehab.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.459
You know what? Worry about that

18:47.543 --> 18:50.295
once the lawyers finally
let you leave the house.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.133
But this is a cool spot to be trapped in.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.803
You can just splash
your broth all over this.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.931
Do I smell lavender?

19:01.515 --> 19:02.432
Yeah.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.270
You know what?
Look at me running off at the mouth.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.982
You wanna probably plan all the fun stuff
you gonna do with your money.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.859
Oh, Mama's got some ideas.

19:11.942 --> 19:15.487
Oh, well, make sure Mama don't forget
about Uncle Sam's cut, though.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.197
[scoffs] Them taxes are a bitch.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.198
Ooh.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.994
I took home way less
than I thought I would've.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.495
Almost wasn't even worth it.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.290
God bless.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.500
God bless.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.587
[funky instrumental music playing]

19:31.670 --> 19:35.924
-Are you sitting on something?
-[sarcastically] I am sitting on a lot.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.178
Okay. If you don't stop shading me
in my own house…

19:39.887 --> 19:42.139
Tired of you treating me
like I'm less than you.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.684
I treat you like
the side chick that you are.

19:46.852 --> 19:47.728
Okay.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.648
Okay, you need to slow your roll,
Miss 16 and Pregnant.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.151
How many times do I have to tell you,

19:54.234 --> 19:56.528
I did not know that Bennie was married.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.239
Yeah, but you've known
for quite some time,

19:59.323 --> 20:02.075
and yet, you act like
you still don't know.

20:02.159 --> 20:05.579
Always popping up
in his face asking for shit.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.247
Like he got shit to give.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.791
-I'm asking for Kelvin.
-Ah, mm-mmm.

20:09.875 --> 20:15.297
Kelvin can't drive, and Bennie stole
my money to buy your ass a car.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.716
Oh. A car? [scoffs]

20:18.300 --> 20:20.302
Okay, girl, let's clear things up.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.013
Okay, you talking about…

20:23.764 --> 20:24.932
that piece of shit?

20:26.391 --> 20:29.811
Now, I don't know about no stolen money,
but you can have the car.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.482
I leave the keys right there on the hood
hoping somebody will steal it!

20:35.067 --> 20:36.902
-That's what he gave you?
-Mm-hmm.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.863
Even you deserve better than that.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.242
Look.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.829
I work crazy hours, okay?

20:47.913 --> 20:51.667
Putting food on the table, trying
to take care of my son by myself.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.254
And then Bennie
finally decides to step up.

20:55.337 --> 20:59.549
And, yes, I know… I know
that a lot of that is 'cause of you.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.262
But damn, girl, why all the drama?

21:03.345 --> 21:07.516
It's like, I come, you go.
I sit, you stand. What are we doing?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.309
Oh, I know what I'm doing.

21:09.393 --> 21:13.146
I'm waiting for a damn, "I'm sorry."

21:14.189 --> 21:16.858
Apologize to you for what?

21:17.651 --> 21:21.822
Sleeping with some guy who didn't tell me
he was married? Getting pregnant?

21:22.406 --> 21:23.740
Keeping the kid?

21:24.741 --> 21:27.035
Asking the daddy to act like a daddy?

21:27.953 --> 21:28.870
Like… [scoffs]

21:28.954 --> 21:30.372
Where did I go wrong?

21:30.455 --> 21:34.334
You gonna have to draw me a map,
because I am so lost.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.754
Just do my hair.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.882
Please.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.180
[sighs] With pleasure.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.226
[funky instrumental music playing]

21:51.310 --> 21:53.562
This is so not worth being popular.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.940
Who am I kidding?
It's definitely worth it.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.905
"Just got back from the gym.
#Holdingitdown"

22:04.781 --> 22:08.118
"Look at me. I'm Aaliyah!"

22:08.201 --> 22:10.329
What the hell are you doing in my clothes?

"'Gram, 'Gram, 'Gram!
I hope Steph likes my 'Gram."

22:15.000 --> 22:16.460
I'm not playing with you, Maya.

22:16.543 --> 22:21.882
"I don't have time for Maya.
All I care about is Steph Greene."

22:21.965 --> 22:25.927
"Hey, Siri, tell Steph Greene
that I love being in her butt."

-Uh-oh! The phone did it!
-I hate you!

22:33.894 --> 22:36.563
-I can't believe you just did that!
-I can't believe I missed.

22:36.646 --> 22:37.981
Well, I won't.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.361
Hey! What the hell is going on in here?

22:42.444 --> 22:45.405
-Maya threw a bowl at me!
-Aaliyah threw one first!

22:45.489 --> 22:48.700
I don't know what y'all are arguing about
and I don't care.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.243
You're both on punishment!

22:50.327 --> 22:53.413
Y'all wanna fight with each other?
You're gonna do chores with each other.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.498
Cool!

22:58.668 --> 23:00.921
-Your hair looks real--
-Don't even try it!

23:04.257 --> 23:07.511
You know I don't allow yelling
when I've just got my braids done.

[funky instrumental music playing]

23:09.388 --> 23:10.222
Boop.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.557
-[Bennie sighs]
-Damn!

23:13.141 --> 23:14.810
You just took my last dollar.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.938
Somebody punch me
so I can tell my girl I got mugged.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.022
[laughs]

23:19.523 --> 23:22.567
Hey, I cleaned you out,
but I filled you up. You're welcome.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.988
Truth be told, this is the first
real food I've had since the fire.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.326
Edible underwear isn't the same
when you're not eating it off somebody.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.454
Good luck to you, man.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.083
[muttering] Look at this--

23:38.166 --> 23:41.795
I know. Y'all don't want to see me,
but I got something to say.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.755
Well, say it outside, man.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.966
-I'm dropping the suit.
-Say it again?

23:46.925 --> 23:50.345
Look, I really wasn't
trying to hurt you guys.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.807
Well, shit. I can't lose
my friends over money.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.183
Your mama cool with that?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.727
I'm a grown-ass man.
I make my own decisions.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.396
You didn't tell her yet, did you?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.398
Because I decided not to.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.859
But I called the lawyer.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.987
It's done. So, we good?

24:07.070 --> 24:08.113
[scoffs] Nah.

24:08.822 --> 24:12.075
We ain't good, man. You tried to sue me.
Get your ass out of here.

24:12.159 --> 24:15.745
-Come on. He's trying to make it right.
-I make fun of Tony, we good.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.291
I sent Duck to prison, we cool.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.627
I owe Larry five Gs, we all right.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.713
How much?

24:24.796 --> 24:28.467
And I bag on this piece of shit
a couple times

24:29.050 --> 24:31.011
and he tried to ruin my life.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.721
I'm not going to forget about that.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.931
He sued me too.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.893
But Davis is a friend.
You should get over it.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.937
Yeah. You should stop telling me
how to feel about shit.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.234
I mean, it is what it is, man.

24:49.362 --> 24:51.031
I don't need any of this drama.

24:51.114 --> 24:55.619
I'm gonna head back to the shelter.
Lucretia, can you spot me another five?

24:56.328 --> 24:57.662
I gave you a five?

25:00.707 --> 25:02.375
You're still with me, right?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.213
Oh, totally.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.090
Wanna grab some dinner?

25:10.675 --> 25:12.427
I would, but, um…

25:13.762 --> 25:14.596
I, uh…

25:15.972 --> 25:17.724
I just started fasting.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.729
