- Not a chance.

ICE Agent Mike Mulder's chest.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.067

Other agents?

would've been targeted, yeah?

of the video

13:58.105 --> 13:59.472

a glimpse of the shooter,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.583

of Mulder and Alvarez.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.180

went missing,

22:29.782 --> 22:30.683
I moved the rest to my office.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.218
Then prove it by giving us

22:32.284 --> 22:34.220
a lead that we
can work with here, Brad.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.688

you're staring down

22:35.755 --> 22:37.590
an accessory to murder charge.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.495
Okay, is there--
is there anyone else

22:42.562 --> 22:44.230
that you know
that he blames for this?

22:44.296 --> 22:46.433
Or--or a hideout
that maybe he's gone off to?

22:46.499 --> 22:48.367

I would tell you

22:48.435 --> 22:50.970

he's gonna stop.

But you have to find him
another way.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.409
Then that's what we'll do.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.978
We're gonna send you down

23:02.882 --> 23:04.150

the Trojan horse

didn't know who the sender was

23:21.167 --> 23:23.670

wouldn't there be some evidence
on the hard drive?

23:26.939 --> 23:29.375

a third to Congressman Grange.
