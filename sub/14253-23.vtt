WEBVTT

00:10.210 --> 00:12.144
Come in.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.379
You wished to see me.

00:17.450 --> 00:20.851
We've known each
other for how long?

00:20.920 --> 00:22.820
Approximately 20 years.

00:22.889 --> 00:26.256
We've served on three
starships together.

00:26.326 --> 00:29.659
l was present at your
daughter's Kolinahr.

00:29.729 --> 00:33.187
l consider you one
of my closest friends.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.826
And l regard you
with the same esteem.

00:35.935 --> 00:39.496
l've always been
honest with you,

00:39.606 --> 00:44.407
but you've been keeping
something from me.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.445
l don't know what you mean.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.480
Don't you?

00:48.548 --> 00:51.745
lt took exhaustive research,

00:51.818 --> 00:54.309
sifting through
teraquads of data,

00:54.387 --> 00:58.255
separating fact from rumor...

00:58.324 --> 01:00.724
but eventually,
l arrived at the truth.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.262
Captain...

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.240 --> 01:15.537
Happy Birthday.

01:17.777 --> 01:18.709
Thank you.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.211
So, it's not long

01:20.280 --> 01:22.646
before you hit the
big three digits, hmm?

01:22.715 --> 01:24.910
lndeed.

01:24.984 --> 01:26.884
Have you informed anyone else

01:26.953 --> 01:28.147
of your discovery?

01:28.221 --> 01:30.951
Don't worry, Tuvok,
my lips are sealed.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.322
Well, you're supposed
to blow out the candle.

01:33.393 --> 01:36.123
That is not a Vulcan custom.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.754
Humor me.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.822
Captain to the Bridge.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.932
Well?

01:49.309 --> 01:51.402
lt was a fire hazard.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.148
We're receiving
a distress call--

01:59.219 --> 02:01.483
a small vessel on
an intercept course.

02:01.554 --> 02:02.486
Life signs?

02:02.555 --> 02:03.487
One.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.148
lt's Ocampan.

02:05.225 --> 02:08.058
We're being hailed.

02:10.697 --> 02:11.789
Kes?

02:11.865 --> 02:13.890
Captain Janeway...

02:14.000 --> 02:15.558
l need your help.

02:16.870 --> 02:20.306
Will you please give me
permission to come aboard?

02:20.406 --> 02:22.101
Of course. What's happened?

02:22.175 --> 02:25.611
Please, let me come aboard.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.443
Prepare the docking port.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.949
Tell the Doctor to stand by.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.177
Her ship is accelerating.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.617
lt's on a collision course.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.620
Janeway to Kes.

02:35.688 --> 02:36.620
Cut your engines.

02:36.689 --> 02:37.951
You're coming in too fast.

02:38.024 --> 02:39.218
Five seconds till impact.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.452
Lock on a tractor beam.

02:40.527 --> 02:41.585
Evasive maneuvers.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.223
Hull breach on Deck 9!

02:45.298 --> 02:46.526
Emergency force fields.

02:46.599 --> 02:47.964
Captain, a transporter

02:48.067 --> 02:49.796
was activated
just before impact.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.370
She's beamed aboard.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.350
l'm reading bulkhead ruptures--

04:47.420 --> 04:50.878
Deck 1 1, Section 17... 18... 19.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.889
Cause?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.152
Unknown.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.955
l have located Kes.
She's moving through

04:55.061 --> 04:56.426
those sections.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.555
She's giving off high levels
of neurogenic energy.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.862
Janeway to Kes. Kes, respond.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.200
Hull breach, Section 20.

05:05.271 --> 05:08.570
Force fields.
Security to Deck 1 1.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.448
Force fields are not holding.

05:16.516 --> 05:19.144
She's approaching
Main Engineering.

05:19.218 --> 05:21.311
Bridge to Engineering.
lntruder alert.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.848
Stop where you are.

05:48.414 --> 05:49.745
Kes?

05:51.984 --> 05:53.542
State your intentions.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.458
Evacuate Engineering.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.878
Warp power is fluctuating.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.246
Torres to Bridge.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.311
Kes is in direct contact
with the warp core.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.788
She's drawing power

06:30.857 --> 06:31.983
from it somehow.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.320
Shut it down.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.848
Warp power is
returning to normal.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.178
B'Elanna, report.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.116
Lieutenant Torres is dead.

07:00.186 --> 07:03.849
Kes has vanished.

07:18.871 --> 07:19.963
And send Mulcahy.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.699
He's in deflector control.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.639
We'll need more power
to Junction 12-J,

07:23.709 --> 07:25.267
and tell Harry l
want to talk to him

07:25.344 --> 07:28.472
about building
a new energy grid.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.311
Lost?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.350
No, just looking.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.782
Captain Janeway suggested that

07:32.852 --> 07:34.410
l get more familiar
with the ship.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.284
Well, if you have any
questions, let me know.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.287
Thanks.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.085
We're about to run a diagnostic

07:39.158 --> 07:40.625
on the warp core assembly.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.126
You can watch if you want.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.460
Thanks, but l really should
be getting back to Sick Bay.

07:52.405 --> 07:55.272
Computer, how long has Voyager
been in the Delta Quadrant?

07:55.341 --> 07:57.969
56 days, 17 hours.

08:07.687 --> 08:08.949
Back so soon?

08:09.021 --> 08:10.818
l thought you went
to the Airponics Bay

08:10.957 --> 08:11.821
to collect herbs.

08:11.958 --> 08:12.982
l forgot something.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.424
Ah.

08:15.828 --> 08:16.817
Pyong Ko.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.760
Excuse me?

08:18.831 --> 08:19.763
You encouraged me

08:19.832 --> 08:21.265
to choose a name,
remember?

08:21.334 --> 08:24.064
Pyong Ko was a 21st-century
surgeon who discovered

08:24.170 --> 08:26.832
the genetic sequence for
inhibiting cancer cells.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.464
lt heralded a new chapter
in Earth's medical history.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.133
That's a perfect name, Doctor.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.336
Hmm.

08:32.410 --> 08:35.539
Then again, l'm also
considering Schweitzer,

08:35.615 --> 08:36.775
Jarvik, Pasteur.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.714
There are so
many options,

08:38.784 --> 08:40.183
each with
its own merits.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.517
Why don't you give it
some more thought?

08:42.587 --> 08:44.419
You don't have
to decide right away.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.481
Of course, it's not
that l require one

08:46.559 --> 08:47.787
for reasons of vanity.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.829
l'm just a
hologram, after all,

08:50.897 --> 08:54.731
but if l had a name
other than ''Doctor''

08:54.800 --> 08:56.791
or ''Hey, you,''
it might encourage the crew

08:56.869 --> 08:58.769
to treat me
with a little more respect.

09:02.074 --> 09:03.905
Kes?

09:22.428 --> 09:24.419
Hello?

09:26.332 --> 09:27.993
Neelix?

09:52.391 --> 09:54.791
You know, Neelix, if you want
to put your own stamp on it,

09:54.860 --> 09:56.452
maybe you should give it
your own name,

09:56.529 --> 09:57.894
like ''the Greasy Neelix,''

09:57.997 --> 10:00.693
or the, uh,
''Double Talaxian with Cheese.''

10:00.766 --> 10:02.097
Ah. lt has a nice ring to it.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.190
Thank you, Lieutenant.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.566
l'll keep that in mind.

10:05.671 --> 10:08.231
Sweeting, what'll
it be? The usual?

10:08.341 --> 10:09.706
l'm not hungry.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.938
l thought that l'd bring
Captain Janeway some coffee.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.240
That's very thoughtful.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.681
l'm looking forward
to tonight.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.914
Actually, l have
a lot of work

10:22.989 --> 10:24.354
to do in Sick Bay.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.391
But l already reserved
the holodeck.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.824
l thought we could take

10:27.893 --> 10:30.088
a moonlit stroll
through the marshlands

10:30.162 --> 10:31.959
of Oshionian Prime.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.726
Another time.
l promise.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.096
Something wrong?

10:35.201 --> 10:36.395
Bad morning.

10:36.502 --> 10:38.868
Anything l can do?

10:38.938 --> 10:40.405
l'll be fine.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.742
l'm not having
a great day, either.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.902
Nobody seems to like
today's menu.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.538
l tried blaming it
on a replicator malfunction,

10:48.614 --> 10:51.481
but no one
believed me.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.314
Wait. l... l think
l see something.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.548
Neelix to Security.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.419
Kes's frown is losing

10:58.491 --> 11:00.118
its structural integrity.

11:00.192 --> 11:02.524
Red Alert.
l'm detecting a smile.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.325
That's my Kes.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.229
The coffee?

11:16.609 --> 11:18.167
That last attack
nearly cost us

11:18.244 --> 11:19.370
our impulse drives.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.140
Fortunately,
B'Elanna found a way

11:21.213 --> 11:23.078
to reroute power
from the deflector.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.049
A good choice
for Chief Engineer,

11:25.117 --> 11:26.550
if l do say so myself.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.177
Getting to know
your enemy.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.484
l feel like l already do.

11:30.556 --> 11:31.955
Remember the old story?

11:32.024 --> 11:35.050
A man goes to Risa,
where he meets a beautiful woman

11:35.127 --> 11:37.652
who invites him
for an evening of passion.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.324
He wakes up in the morning
feeling wonderful,

11:40.399 --> 11:42.731
until he discovers
he's missing a kidney.

11:42.835 --> 11:45.599
Every cadet about to go
on his first shore leave

11:45.705 --> 11:47.229
hears that cautionary tale.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.103
Doesn't seem so outrageous
anymore, does it?

11:50.176 --> 11:52.144
No, but the Vidiians are more

11:52.211 --> 11:54.805
than just
your garden-variety monsters.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.007
l've been studying
their culture.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.880
They were a lot like us
before the phage.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.377
Do l detect a note of sympathy?

12:03.456 --> 12:06.914
Makes you wonder what we'd do
under the same circumstances.

12:07.993 --> 12:08.925
Come in.

12:09.995 --> 12:12.020
Oh, you read my mind.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.895
Vidiians?

12:13.999 --> 12:15.296
l'm afraid so.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.596
We've picked up two more ships
on long-range sensors.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.068
l've gone to full
tactical alert.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.332
We're taking every precaution.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.168
l'm sure you'll get
us through it safely.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.539
Thanks for
the vote of confidence.

12:24.610 --> 12:28.569
Tuvok thinks he's found a way
to penetrate their shields.

12:28.647 --> 12:32.105
The next time they attack us,
it won't be so easy.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.310
That's good to hear.

12:33.385 --> 12:34.943
Captain to the Bridge.

12:35.054 --> 12:35.952
On my way.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.454
Oops.

12:37.523 --> 12:38.455
l... l'm so clumsy.

12:38.524 --> 12:39.456
l'm sorry.

12:39.525 --> 12:40.822
Don't worry about it.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.794
This desk has seen
its share of coffee spills,

12:43.863 --> 12:44.852
believe me.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.132
Ensign Wildman has
an intriguing proposal.

12:56.242 --> 12:57.573
We've been analyzing

12:57.643 --> 13:00.168
the Vidiian bio-readings
from the last attack.

13:00.246 --> 13:01.372
Their immune systems

13:01.447 --> 13:03.415
have been compromised
by the phage.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.416
We could synthesize
a neural agent

13:05.484 --> 13:08.351
that would incapacitate
them without affecting us.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.388
Might come in handy
if we're ever boarded.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.388
Exactly.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.549
Work with the Doctor.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.684
When you've got something,
find a way to deploy it

13:14.760 --> 13:16.159
through
the environmental systems.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.753
Aye, Captain.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.733
The ships we detected earlier

13:31.844 --> 13:33.471
have disappeared
from our sensors.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.535
Maybe we outran them.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.376
They wouldn't give
up that easily.

13:36.448 --> 13:37.938
Why would they?

13:38.050 --> 13:40.712
Voyager's the only organ bank
within half a parsec.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.515
We fought off
their first attacks.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.580
Now they seem content
to show up on sensors

13:45.658 --> 13:47.455
just long enough
for us to change course.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.050
lt's like
we're being herded somewhere.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.595
lf we maintain
our present course,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.893
we're gonna enter a region
filled with subspace vacuoles.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.762
We'd have to drop
to impulse to get through.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.426
Sounds like a good place
for an ambush.

13:56.535 --> 13:57.695
The Maquis used to lure

13:57.803 --> 13:59.532
the Cardassians
into the Badlands.

13:59.638 --> 14:02.004
Those Galor-class cruisers
had nowhere to run.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.632
Neither will we, unless...

14:04.710 --> 14:08.043
Tom, how dense
are those vacuoles?

14:08.113 --> 14:11.344
They cover about 70
percent of the region.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.078
Excuse me, Doctor.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.245
Tom, what's the first thing
they teach you

14:15.321 --> 14:17.050
about maneuvering
at warp?

14:17.122 --> 14:19.716
''Faster than light,
no left or right.''

14:19.792 --> 14:22.818
When possible,
maintain a linear trajectory.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.261
Course corrections
could fracture the hull.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.458
Exactly. We'd have
to drop to impulse

14:27.533 --> 14:29.592
every time we made
a course change,

14:29.702 --> 14:32.262
but what if we let
Voyager do the driving?

14:32.371 --> 14:34.168
Ma'am?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.935
We could preprogram
every kilometer.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.476
That way we'd only spend
a second or two at impulse

14:38.544 --> 14:40.444
every time the computer
executed a turn.

14:40.512 --> 14:41.945
Auto-navigation
the entire way?

14:42.047 --> 14:43.776
No offense,
but the neural gel packs

14:43.849 --> 14:46.784
can calculate vectors
a little faster than you can.

14:46.852 --> 14:47.944
B'Elanna?

14:48.020 --> 14:49.487
We'd need a more accurate

14:49.555 --> 14:50.852
scan of the region.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.221
lf we even graze
one of those vacuoles...

14:53.292 --> 14:55.089
We could send
a shuttle ahead.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.149
The Delta Flyer.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.958
lts sensors
are more advanced.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.965
The Delta what?

15:05.204 --> 15:06.762
Forgive me.

15:06.872 --> 15:09.500
l... must have been thinking
of another starship.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.476
Prepare a shuttle.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.341
l want all
of Voyager's systems

15:14.413 --> 15:17.246
operating at peak efficiency
by the time Tom gets back.

15:17.316 --> 15:18.783
lf we're going
to pull this off,

15:18.851 --> 15:21.149
there's no margin
for error. Dismissed.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.536
Computer, display an image
of the Ocampan homeworld.

15:42.374 --> 15:45.275
Plot a course
from Voyager's current position.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.681
Homesick?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.718
Lieutenant.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.084
Tom.

15:56.155 --> 15:57.281
lt's okay.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.483
A lot of people on
board feel the same way.

15:59.558 --> 16:03.460
l spent my entire life trying
to get away from Ocampa.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.553
Why would l want
to go back?

16:05.597 --> 16:06.928
Because it's home.

16:06.999 --> 16:09.593
Home for me means
a penal colony.

16:09.702 --> 16:13.399
Out here, l get to fly
a state-of-the-art ship,

16:13.505 --> 16:16.133
and there's no admirals
in sight.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.266
What are you doing?

16:17.376 --> 16:20.345
Getting ready
for a scouting mission.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.977
You planning on going somewhere?

16:26.051 --> 16:27.882
Uh, no, of course not.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.753
l was just studying
the helm configurations.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.850
l didn't know
you could pilot a shuttle.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.220
l can't...

16:37.296 --> 16:39.093
but l'd like to learn.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.223
Well, then,
why not learn from the best?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.029
l could start you off
on the holodeck

16:43.135 --> 16:44.432
on an old class-1.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.437
That's the kind of shuttle
my father used to take me up in.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.940
That would be
very nice, Lieutenant.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.039
Tom.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.058
ldentify yourself.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.354
lt's me, Tuvok.

17:08.426 --> 17:09.723
Naomi Wildman.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.126
May l help you, sir?

17:42.194 --> 17:44.594
Lieutenant, is
something wrong?

18:02.781 --> 18:04.806
Hello, sweeting.

18:04.883 --> 18:09.115
l took the liberty of preparing
one of your favorite meals.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.248
lt's under replicator program
''Neelix 1.''

18:12.324 --> 18:14.815
Call me
if you'd like some company.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.224
Miss you.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.825
Computer, end music.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.832
Open an encrypted channel.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.498
Direct the signal
to the following coordinates.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.145
Channel open.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.203
My name is Kes.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.748
l'm aboard the Starship Voyager.

18:37.816 --> 18:38.783
Respond.

18:40.519 --> 18:43.079
l know you're receiving
this transmission,

18:43.155 --> 18:45.180
and l also know
that your attempt

18:45.257 --> 18:47.225
to capture this ship will fail.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.624
lf you want
to harvest Voyager's crew,

18:49.695 --> 18:51.754
l suggest you answer me now.

18:54.399 --> 18:55.559
Explain.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.364
Captain Janeway is aware
of your ambush.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.961
She's found a way
to evade your vessels,

19:01.073 --> 19:02.506
but l can help you.

19:02.574 --> 19:04.769
l'm listening.

19:04.843 --> 19:05.969
l can send you

19:06.044 --> 19:07.636
tactical data
on their shields, weapons--

19:07.713 --> 19:10.147
everything you need
to take this ship.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.342
This is a deception.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.612
Do you want this crew or not?

19:14.686 --> 19:17.553
ln return?

19:17.623 --> 19:21.354
Safe passage to Ocampa
for myself and one other.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.827
Why would you sentence
your own crew to death?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.592
They're not my crew.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.463
They abandoned me
a long time ago.

20:08.273 --> 20:11.037
Computer, access Voyager's
tactical database.

20:11.109 --> 20:14.101
Command authorization required.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.644
Access granted.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.813
Naomi Wildman?

20:23.889 --> 20:27.290
She appeared to be
half Ktarian.

20:27.359 --> 20:29.088
Ensign Wildman's
husband is Ktarian.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.822
l met him once on
Deep Space 9.

20:30.896 --> 20:31.954
There's more.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.794
l followed her to Cargo Bay 2,

20:34.866 --> 20:37.960
where l saw a woman
and two children,

20:38.103 --> 20:40.628
all with cybernetic implants.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.673
Borg?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.971
l can't explain
it, Captain.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.877
l've had hallucinations
before, but only while

20:48.947 --> 20:51.381
in a state of
deep meditation.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.384
These were specific,

20:53.452 --> 20:56.888
and they evoked a
sense of anticipation.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.253
lt almost sounds like
you're describing a premonition.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.689
lndeed.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.158
l didn't think
Vulcans had premonitions.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.321
They don't.

21:04.396 --> 21:06.956
That's what concerns me.

21:09.167 --> 21:12.694
Computer, maintain
a continuous proximity scan

21:12.804 --> 21:14.169
of Lieutenant Tuvok,

21:14.239 --> 21:17.140
ten meter radius,
all sensor parameters.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.177
ln case you have
any more ''visions.''

21:19.244 --> 21:21.872
A logical plan.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.244
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.282
Go ahead.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.611
We're approaching the vacuoles.

21:25.684 --> 21:26.651
On my way.

21:39.264 --> 21:41.789
Last chance to take
the long way around.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.427
lt does feel like
we're sneaking through

21:44.536 --> 21:45.503
a graveyard at midnight.

21:45.604 --> 21:46.730
Any sign of the Vidiians?

21:46.838 --> 21:50.001
Not yet, but it's a safe
bet they're in there.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.006
Tom?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.872
Trajectories
laid in.

21:52.944 --> 21:57.210
Our trip will take three hours,
12 minutes, 1 1 seconds,

21:57.282 --> 21:59.216
with 216 course changes.

21:59.284 --> 22:01.582
Well, let's get started.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.917
Engaging at warp 8.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.855
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.729
One of the vacuoles
shifted position.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.561
The computer's
adjusting our vector.

22:14.633 --> 22:17.534
Dropping to impulse.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.036
2.3 degree turn starboard.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.936
Jumping to warp 6.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.201
One down,

22:23.275 --> 22:24.606
215 to go.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.871
l'll be in Sick Bay.

22:28.747 --> 22:31.307
Dropping to impulse.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.544
New heading: O-31 mark 2.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.548
There's a ship approaching.

22:37.622 --> 22:39.180
lt's on a collision course.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.589
l'm not reading any ship.

22:43.995 --> 22:45.257
Lieutenant?

22:52.504 --> 22:56.065
Permission to be relieved, sir.

22:56.174 --> 22:58.472
l am not well.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.443
Of course.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.252
The molecular structures
appear to be stable. Good.

23:15.694 --> 23:16.718
Report.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.023
We've devised a neural agent

23:18.096 --> 23:20.291
that should inhibit the
Vidiians' motor functions

23:20.365 --> 23:22.026
without causing any
permanent damage.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.432
Good. l don't want to add
to their health problems.

23:24.536 --> 23:26.595
l just want to keep them
from adding to ours.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.229
l'll get to work.

23:32.744 --> 23:33.836
Doctor...

23:33.912 --> 23:35.174
when was the last time

23:35.247 --> 23:37.681
you examined
Ensign Wildman?

23:37.749 --> 23:41.344
l performed her annual physical
six weeks ago.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.082
Did you find anything unusual?

23:44.156 --> 23:46.716
She's in perfect health.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.260
This may seem like
a strange question,

23:49.327 --> 23:51.795
but l need to know
if she's pregnant.

23:51.863 --> 23:54.923
l'm not at liberty to
disclose that information.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.001
Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

23:57.068 --> 23:59.002
What about ''Captain's orders?''

23:59.070 --> 24:00.002
Sorry.

24:00.038 --> 24:01.164
Medical protocol supersede

24:01.239 --> 24:02.672
your authority
in these matters.

24:02.741 --> 24:05.710
The security of this ship
could be at stake.

24:08.346 --> 24:10.746
She planned on
telling you herself.

24:10.816 --> 24:11.874
Boy or girl?

24:12.017 --> 24:13.814
Female... half Ktarian,
as a matter of fact,

24:13.885 --> 24:15.045
which should
nearly double

24:15.120 --> 24:16.553
the infant's gestation period.

24:16.621 --> 24:17.747
How did you know?

24:21.293 --> 24:24.126
And they say l'm rude.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.255
We're receiving a distress call.

24:26.331 --> 24:28.162
Life signs?

24:28.233 --> 24:29.825
lt's Ocampan.

24:29.935 --> 24:31.232
Kes?

24:31.336 --> 24:32.462
Let me come on board.

24:32.571 --> 24:34.061
Her ship is accelerating.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.935
lt's on a collision course.

24:36.007 --> 24:37.941
Hull breach on Deck 9!

24:38.009 --> 24:39.340
Emergency force fields.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.208
She's approaching
Main Engineering.

24:41.279 --> 24:42.576
State your intentions.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.909
Let me come on board.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.074
lt's on a collision course.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.549
We're receiving
a distress call.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.210
Bridge to Engineering.
lntruder alert.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.218
Stop where you are.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.219
Kes?

24:50.288 --> 24:51.220
State your intentions.

24:51.289 --> 24:52.221
Warp power's fluctuating.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.257
Torres to Bridge.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.349
Kes is in direct contact
with the warp core.

24:54.426 --> 24:55.552
She's drawing power
from it somehow.

24:55.627 --> 24:56.594
Shut it down!

24:57.629 --> 24:59.688
Problem?

25:13.011 --> 25:14.308
Hey.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.609
Torres to Sick Bay.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.344
Medical emergency.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.383
20 milligrams lectrazine.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.049
Cortical stimulator.

25:33.798 --> 25:35.095
We'll start at 20 millijoules.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.155
-Ready.
-Now!

25:38.203 --> 25:41.172
He's gone into synaptic shock.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.241
l don't understand.

25:51.449 --> 25:52.780
Can l speak with him?

25:52.851 --> 25:55.285
l think it's best to keep him
sedated for now.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.287
When did this begin?

25:57.355 --> 25:59.152
Earlier this afternoon
in Engineering.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.658
Time... l need the exact time.

26:01.760 --> 26:06.254
Lieutenant Torres called
Sick Bay at 1422 hours.

26:09.634 --> 26:11.829
Computer, display proximity scan
of Lieutenant Tuvok

26:11.970 --> 26:15.406
at 1422 hours.

26:18.043 --> 26:19.032
Oh...

26:19.144 --> 26:20.668
Captain?

26:20.745 --> 26:22.770
Tachyons.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.007
l beg your pardon?

26:24.082 --> 26:26.175
There was a surge
of tachyon particles

26:26.251 --> 26:27.684
just before Tuvok collapsed.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.686
That could have triggered this,

26:29.754 --> 26:31.551
but where did they come from?

26:31.623 --> 26:34.592
They're normally caused
by temporal distortions.

26:34.659 --> 26:35.683
Time travel?

26:35.760 --> 26:38.024
Let me know
if his condition changes.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.565
Kes...

26:42.634 --> 26:45.535
you have telepathic abilities.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.165
Have you experienced
anything unusual

26:49.274 --> 26:52.243
during the past couple of days?

26:52.344 --> 26:55.142
Hallucinations, premonitions?

26:55.213 --> 26:56.305
No, nothing.

26:56.381 --> 26:59.214
lf you do, you'll let me know?

26:59.284 --> 27:01.411
Of course, Captain.

27:10.996 --> 27:13.157
We're low on neuro-stabilizers.

27:13.231 --> 27:15.324
l'll go replicate some more.

27:17.168 --> 27:19.159
Hurry back.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.067
Where's the tactical data
you promised us?

27:21.139 --> 27:22.299
l'm downloading it now.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.739
l'll transmit it to you
once you've arrived.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.640
l need it now!

27:26.711 --> 27:28.338
Janeway's already suspicious.

27:28.413 --> 27:30.745
lf l transmit it now,
l'll be discovered.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.339
That's your problem.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.351
Apparently it's yours, too.

27:39.624 --> 27:42.889
Gentlemen, scan for
tachyon particles deck by deck.

27:42.961 --> 27:43.893
Tachyons?

27:43.962 --> 27:44.894
Do it.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.897
Looking for something specific?

27:46.965 --> 27:48.091
l'm not sure.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.469
Report!

27:51.536 --> 27:52.935
We're under attack.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.938
A Vidiian ship is closing
on our position.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.974
Battle stations.

28:13.124 --> 28:15.718
We've lost warp drive
and weapons.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.318
They're cutting
through our shields.

28:17.395 --> 28:18.657
Remodulate.

28:18.730 --> 28:19.992
l'm trying.

28:20.065 --> 28:21.999
They keep matching
the frequencies.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.398
We've still got impulse.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.298
They've taken out navigation.

28:25.403 --> 28:26.870
l can't plot a course.

28:45.457 --> 28:48.051
They're cutting an access route
through the hull.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.026
Evacuate Deck 3 and seal it off.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.187
Bridge to Sick Bay.

28:51.262 --> 28:52.889
Are you ready
with that neural agent?

28:52.997 --> 28:54.123
Aye, Captain.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.757
Stand by to release it
on Deck 3.

28:55.834 --> 28:57.096
Acknowledged.

28:57.202 --> 28:58.863
50 milliliters should suffice.

29:00.371 --> 29:01.804
Doctor!

29:01.873 --> 29:03.135
Doctor to the Bridge.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.199
Environmental controls
aren't responding!

29:05.310 --> 29:06.777
Harry, what's going on?

29:06.845 --> 29:09.245
We've been locked out
of that system.

29:09.314 --> 29:11.282
What do you mean, ''locked out?''

29:11.349 --> 29:13.579
The command relays
have been fused.

29:13.651 --> 29:15.346
They knew where to find us.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.445
They knew our
shield frequencies,

29:17.522 --> 29:19.149
which systems to target...

29:19.224 --> 29:20.816
We're being boarded!

29:20.892 --> 29:22.587
l'm reading an EM fluctuation.

29:22.660 --> 29:24.252
lt could be a transmission.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.227
Location?

29:25.296 --> 29:27.287
Airponics Bay.

29:27.365 --> 29:28.297
Who's down there?

29:28.366 --> 29:30.493
l'm picking up two bio-readings.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.093
The sensors must
be malfunctioning.

29:33.204 --> 29:34.796
They're both reading as Kes.

29:35.907 --> 29:38.307
Security to Airponics Bay.

29:38.376 --> 29:40.344
Shut down control functions
to that section.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.003
l'm going down there.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.809
Something tells me
we've got more

29:43.882 --> 29:45.440
than one battle on our hands.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.362
Computer, initiate
site-to-site transport.

29:59.430 --> 30:00.897
Program Kes beta-6.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.455
Unable to comply.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.729
Control functions
have been disabled.

30:13.344 --> 30:14.777
Shh! Shh!

30:14.846 --> 30:16.814
Shh. l'm taking you home.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.558
We've got weapons back.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.965
Can you target those hooks?

30:38.069 --> 30:39.297
Not at this range.

30:39.404 --> 30:40.632
We'd breach the upper hull.

30:40.738 --> 30:42.399
lt's better than
being dissected.

30:44.309 --> 30:46.243
Reverse the hull polarity.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.506
Maybe we can shake them loose.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.879
Now, one of you
doesn't belong here,

30:57.956 --> 31:01.722
and l'm guessing it's you.

31:01.793 --> 31:05.092
Tuvok's premonitions were real.

31:05.163 --> 31:07.597
You're from the future.

31:07.665 --> 31:10.395
A future l'm about to change.

31:10.501 --> 31:13.527
You're helping
the Vidiians, Kes.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.105
Why?

31:24.215 --> 31:26.615
...Security to Deck 1 1...

31:32.657 --> 31:35.524
Tell me why you're doing this.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.151
l won't let you hurt her again.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.889
l haven't done anything
to harm her.

31:38.963 --> 31:40.328
You took her from Ocampa--

31:40.398 --> 31:41.865
her home.

31:41.933 --> 31:43.662
She's a prisoner on this ship.

31:43.768 --> 31:46.259
No one's a prisoner here, Kes.

31:46.371 --> 31:47.599
l was a child.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.468
You corrupted me
with your ideas.

31:49.540 --> 31:50.802
What ideas?

31:50.875 --> 31:52.740
Exploration, discovery.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.175
l believed you!

31:56.314 --> 31:57.906
Hull polarity
loosened their hold

31:57.982 --> 31:59.006
but not by much.

31:59.150 --> 32:00.344
lt's a start.

32:00.451 --> 32:01.748
Reroute the deflector.

32:01.786 --> 32:04.016
Have it discharge
antigraviton pulses

32:04.088 --> 32:05.350
along the hull.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.391
Engage the inertial dampers.

32:07.458 --> 32:09.619
Get a controlled pitch going.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.757
ln three years, l'm
going to leave Voyager

32:15.833 --> 32:17.232
in search of higher things,

32:17.335 --> 32:19.098
because you encouraged me
to do it.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.431
You encouraged me

32:20.538 --> 32:22.506
to develop my mental abilities.

32:22.573 --> 32:23.835
l wasn't ready.

32:23.908 --> 32:27.901
But what l found...
l couldn't control it.

32:27.979 --> 32:29.913
lt scared me.

32:29.981 --> 32:31.949
l had nowhere to go.

32:32.016 --> 32:35.213
l thought of returning
home to Ocampa,

32:35.286 --> 32:37.345
but l had changed too much.

32:37.422 --> 32:39.947
l knew
they'd be frightened of me.

32:40.058 --> 32:44.324
l knew they wouldn't accept me,
but they'll accept her.

32:44.395 --> 32:46.386
You don't have
to destroy this ship, Kes.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.726
We can help you.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.233
No. l trusted you.

32:50.335 --> 32:51.233
Kes...

32:51.336 --> 32:52.633
No!

33:00.044 --> 33:01.272
We're breaking free!

33:01.346 --> 33:02.574
They're trying

33:02.647 --> 33:04.114
to lock on us
with a tractor beam.

33:04.182 --> 33:05.444
Reverse thrusters.

33:05.516 --> 33:06.778
Full power.

33:06.851 --> 33:08.284
That could tear
the hull apart.

33:08.353 --> 33:09.650
Then tear it apart!

33:21.733 --> 33:23.860
Photon torpedoes-- full spread.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.801
Ready!

33:26.871 --> 33:28.566
Fire!

33:49.994 --> 33:51.894
lt's set to kill, Kes.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.891
Janeway to Bridge.

34:21.958 --> 34:23.391
Status?

34:23.460 --> 34:25.520
The Vidiians are in retreat.

34:25.596 --> 34:28.895
Everything all right down there?

34:29.000 --> 34:30.797
For now.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.813
She was here...

34:53.891 --> 34:57.224
in my last premonition.

34:57.295 --> 35:00.128
She appeared older.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.325
Her face was tired.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.459
What was she doing?

35:04.569 --> 35:07.595
She had her hands
on the casing,

35:07.705 --> 35:10.606
as if she was drawing
energy from it.

35:10.675 --> 35:13.838
The tachyons
are concentrated here.

35:13.911 --> 35:15.845
lt's possible
she needed the core

35:15.913 --> 35:18.177
to travel back in time.

35:18.249 --> 35:22.549
lf that's true, then
she'll need it again.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.885
But we don't know
when that'll be.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.515
We have to be ready.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.116
Doctor to the Captain.

35:29.193 --> 35:30.217
Go ahead.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.694
Kes has regained consciousness.

35:34.098 --> 35:35.895
What do you remember?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.228
l was in Airponics,

35:37.335 --> 35:38.359
and then l felt dizzy,

35:38.469 --> 35:40.061
and then l was watching myself.

35:40.171 --> 35:41.365
Yourself?

35:41.472 --> 35:43.565
Computer, deactivate EMH.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.211
What l'm about to tell you

35:49.280 --> 35:50.941
stays between the three of us.

35:51.048 --> 35:52.106
Understood?

35:52.183 --> 35:54.378
Yes, Captain.

35:54.452 --> 35:56.943
Something terrible
has happened...

35:57.088 --> 35:59.454
or, more precisely, will happen.

35:59.524 --> 36:00.752
We're going to need your help

36:00.858 --> 36:02.519
to prevent it
from happening again.

36:16.507 --> 36:19.237
lt took exhaustive research

36:19.310 --> 36:22.677
sifting through
teraquads of data,

36:22.747 --> 36:25.477
separating fact from rumor...

36:25.550 --> 36:28.348
but eventually,
l arrived at the truth.

36:29.420 --> 36:31.445
Captain...

36:37.929 --> 36:40.090
Happy Birthday.

36:40.164 --> 36:42.064
Thank you.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.896
So, it's not long
before you hit

36:44.001 --> 36:45.696
the big three digits, huh?

36:45.803 --> 36:47.236
lndeed.

36:47.305 --> 36:50.138
Have you informed
anyone else of your discovery?

36:50.208 --> 36:52.438
Don't worry, Tuvok,
my lips are sealed.

36:52.510 --> 36:55.172
Well, you're supposed
to blow out the candle.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.146
That is not a Vulcan custom.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.308
Humor me.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.680
Captain to the Bridge.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.345
On my way.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.150
Well?

37:09.927 --> 37:11.792
lt was a fire hazard.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.338
We're receiving
a distress call--

37:21.405 --> 37:23.805
a small vessel on
an intercept course.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.102
Life signs?

37:25.176 --> 37:26.234
One.

37:26.310 --> 37:28.301
lt's Ocampan.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.778
l'd almost forgotten.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.189
We're being hailed.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.385
Red Alert.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.155
Raise shields.

37:44.228 --> 37:45.490
Captain?

37:45.563 --> 37:47.326
All hands, this is the Bridge.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.696
Begin emergency
evacuation of Deck 1 1.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.200
Repeat:

37:51.302 --> 37:53.566
All hands evacuate Deck 1 1.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.662
You heard her. Get moving!

37:58.142 --> 37:59.268
Now!

38:00.511 --> 38:01.944
Open a channel.

38:06.751 --> 38:08.480
Kes.

38:08.552 --> 38:11.350
Captain Janeway...

38:11.422 --> 38:13.413
l need your help.

38:13.491 --> 38:16.927
Will you please give me
permission to come aboard?

38:16.994 --> 38:19.360
Of course. What's happened?

38:19.430 --> 38:21.557
Please, let me come aboard.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.663
Her ship is accelerating.

38:26.771 --> 38:28.136
lt's on a collision course.

38:28.205 --> 38:30.139
Five seconds to impact.

38:30.207 --> 38:31.071
Tuvok.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.110
Lock on a tractor beam.

38:33.210 --> 38:35.178
Evasive maneuvers.

38:36.213 --> 38:37.874
Shields are holding.

38:37.948 --> 38:39.575
Her ship is intact.

38:39.650 --> 38:40.582
Captain, a transporter

38:40.651 --> 38:42.084
was activated
just before impact.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.415
She's beamed aboard.

38:48.426 --> 38:50.724
l'm reading bulkhead ruptures
on Deck 1 1,

38:50.795 --> 38:53.229
Section 17... 18, 19.

38:53.297 --> 38:55.595
How did you know?

38:57.368 --> 38:58.665
Ready?

38:59.804 --> 39:01.829
Shut down the warp core.

39:01.939 --> 39:03.907
You have the Bridge.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.998
Remember me?

39:29.066 --> 39:31.660
The innocent child
you're here to save?

39:31.769 --> 39:34.738
You blame Captain Janeway,

39:34.839 --> 39:36.602
but the choice was yours.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.643
You made the decision
to leave Ocampa,

39:39.710 --> 39:43.146
and you made the decision
to leave Voyager.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.411
lf you're watching me now,
you've come back to take revenge

39:46.484 --> 39:48.577
on the people
who cared about you.

39:48.652 --> 39:51.177
That's not who you are,
and that's not who l am.

39:51.255 --> 39:52.517
Don't do this.

39:52.590 --> 39:53.682
Find another way home.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.282
Captain Janeway will help you

39:55.359 --> 39:57.884
if you give her a chance.

39:57.995 --> 40:00.486
Try to remember who you were.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.327
Try to remember me.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.896
Don't you remember?

40:08.072 --> 40:10.165
You made that holo-recording,

40:10.274 --> 40:13.209
because you didn't want
this to happen again.

40:13.277 --> 40:17.941
Three years ago,
you traveled back in time.

40:18.082 --> 40:21.609
Kes, you wanted to take
that woman with you,

40:21.685 --> 40:23.482
and you were willing

40:23.554 --> 40:26.148
to hand the rest of us over
to the Vidiians to do it.

40:26.223 --> 40:27.952
lt didn't work.

40:28.058 --> 40:30.322
You forced me to kill you, Kes.

40:30.394 --> 40:33.795
lf you go back now,
it'll all happen again.

40:35.533 --> 40:38.297
Just before this
terrible thing happened,

40:38.402 --> 40:40.666
you told me
you had nowhere to go.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.432
That's not true.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.007
Stay here with us.

40:44.074 --> 40:45.371
l can't.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.876
l don't belong here.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.344
l need to be with
my own people.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.881
You told me you had
the ability to get home,

40:51.949 --> 40:54.816
but you were afraid the Ocampans
wouldn't accept you.

40:54.885 --> 40:56.079
Why?

41:02.927 --> 41:04.622
l remember...

41:04.695 --> 41:07.858
What? What do you remember?

41:07.932 --> 41:10.332
The holo-recording--
l remember making it.

41:10.434 --> 41:13.301
You asked me to help
you to help myself.

41:16.907 --> 41:20.502
You wanted me to
remember who l was.

41:22.379 --> 41:25.974
These years were so
filled with confusion...

41:29.153 --> 41:32.179
and anger. l...

41:32.256 --> 41:35.953
l buried the memory.

41:36.093 --> 41:38.220
l'd almost forgotten.

41:45.002 --> 41:48.438
Does it really matter
which Kes goes home?

41:54.311 --> 41:56.836
A few snacks
for the journey home.

41:56.914 --> 42:00.441
You do still like leola root?

42:00.518 --> 42:02.452
Thank you.

42:05.122 --> 42:07.215
What?

42:07.291 --> 42:10.226
Just looking.

42:10.294 --> 42:12.387
See anyone you know?

42:13.764 --> 42:15.356
Only you.

42:24.308 --> 42:25.570
Good-bye, Kes.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.907
Captain.

42:44.895 --> 42:48.058
What should we tell the others?

42:48.132 --> 42:51.329
A friend got lost.

42:51.435 --> 42:54.404
We helped her find her way.
