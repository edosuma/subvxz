WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.920
SOMEWHERE IN MUNICH

00:10.360 --> 00:12.400
Are you happy?
- Yes, I am.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.480
We'll manage.
- As I just told them,

00:17.360 --> 00:20.320
the most important thing as of now

00:20.680 --> 00:24.760
is that we want to be open
and honest with one another.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.840
And always talk about everything,
no matter who has a problem.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.360
No matter when or how.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.960
That we're starting a new era with you.

00:35.480 --> 00:39.000
That we focus on soccer

00:39.640 --> 00:44.000
and push aside everything
that's happened. So it's just …

00:45.080 --> 00:46.720
soccer.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.200
How were those squad talks with Julian?
Where does he see Serge?

01:51.880 --> 01:54.880
We've only just started the talks.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.600
Of course he's happy to be here.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.200
He will certainly …

02:02.480 --> 02:05.760
He will also have different systems.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.960
The way he is,
he will certainly be flexible,

02:10.680 --> 02:15.640
and he will also demand this flexibility
from the players. And I think

02:16.040 --> 02:19.040
as a result they'll be able to grow.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.960
Any ideas about the coaching team,
and downward communication?

02:25.320 --> 02:29.200
That's a very good question.
We have definitely learned

02:29.880 --> 02:33.440
from our recent experiences,
and of course that is

02:34.160 --> 02:37.880
one of the crucial
structural issues we've had.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.640
Of course, the new coach
wants to bring his team,

02:43.000 --> 02:44.640
and we'll see …

02:45.440 --> 02:48.000
In the next meetings we will

02:48.760 --> 02:52.240
plan and discuss everything.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.560
Yes, go ahead.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.680
Most importantly
the team has to be in sync

02:58.040 --> 03:00.840
from the very first minute
of next season.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.560
There are unpleasant conversations too.
But that comes with the job.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.560
Okay, it's good.

03:11.640 --> 03:15.600
You always wonder what will happen
when the head coach changes.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.560
DANNY RÖHL - ASSISTANT COACH
As I've worked very closely with Hansi,

03:20.080 --> 03:22.360
I'm worried about the changes.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.200
You have to wait for the outcome of
the talks, the new coach's ideas.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.320
How does he want to play?

03:28.680 --> 03:31.160
Then you have to
make a decision for yourself.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.720
Sometimes it's your own decision,
sometimes a third party decides.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.960
And you must always expect it
to be over.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.640
For 25 years I've been with one club.
And Germany's top club at that.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.880
Now I have decided to leave the club.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.200
It's not easy, but it is what it is.

03:58.080 --> 04:02.360
He is a fantastic person,
he has a great personality,

04:02.720 --> 04:05.760
and he knows how to
work with young people.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.600
He is tremendously experienced
and has a great eye for talent.

04:10.960 --> 04:15.680
Whether Hermann gives the thumbs-up
or the thumbs-down, he's right.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.120
He has an enormous aura.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.560
You're in awe of him,
but he's also

04:23.000 --> 04:25.280
a little scary.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.640
If they don't want to learn this,
I'll have to say,

04:30.000 --> 04:34.200
"Listen, pal. You'll stay behind after
every workout to run some rounds."

04:35.320 --> 04:39.440
I thought it would be fun to show up
for breakfast with black hair.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.360
He saw me and said,
"What's that on your head?"

04:43.720 --> 04:47.480
I said, "I wanted to try something new,
no more blond hair, but black."

04:47.840 --> 04:49.360
He said, "Stop it!

04:49.720 --> 04:52.960
You're going to run rounds
until your hair is back to normal."

04:55.560 --> 04:59.520
His great contribution was
training some first-class players.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.240
Be it Lahm or Thomas Müller …

05:02.680 --> 05:05.040
Basti Schweinsteiger, Holger Badstuber,

05:05.560 --> 05:08.960
Mats Hummels.
If I forget a few, please forgive me.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.360
The legendary header pendulum. No one
gets past it with Hermann Gerland.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.680
Before the Wolfsburg match
we did header pendulums.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.280
We always joke around because my headers
aren't that strong. He was super happy

05:24.640 --> 05:26.680
when I scored my first headed goal.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.080
If you worked hard and performed well,

05:30.440 --> 05:33.440
and he felt you were giving 100 percent,

05:33.800 --> 05:37.080
he gave you your space
and exceptional support.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.120
I used to cry when I was sad.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.560
Today I have tears in my eyes
because I'm happy

05:45.280 --> 05:46.800
to be part of it.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.520
Hermann Gerland

05:52.880 --> 05:55.240
Hermann Gerland

05:55.840 --> 05:59.160
You are the best man

05:59.520 --> 06:01.840
Constant luck equals skill.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.080
So, what's constant bad luck?

06:05.640 --> 06:10.440
MAY 2, 2021
SÄBENER STRASSE

06:15.560 --> 06:18.280
They have to clean up, don't they?
- Yes.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.800
They always have a hard time
keeping their lockers straight, right?

06:24.000 --> 06:28.320
Growing up around here, I think Bayern
Munich must be every child's dream.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.040
First as a player, of course.
I don't think a lot of kids

06:32.400 --> 06:35.120
say they want to be a coach
at age three.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.560
But a player, of course.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.000
Whoa, look at this!
The pure expertise of German soccer.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.240
And me.
- Yeah. Him.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.880
Hey. You look tired.
- Yeah, well,

06:49.240 --> 06:53.240
when I have to talk to you guys,
I get these dark circles around my eyes.

06:58.640 --> 07:03.120
The club is going to great lengths,
but Julian is more than fair.

07:03.480 --> 07:09.200
He's contributing to the transfer fee,
to give the club the chance to raise it.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.960
And that's pretty generous.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.480
It's down to some details now.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.760
A long way to go.
But it's always like that.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.480
Your change has caused a problem.
Now we have to rephrase other passages.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.920
What now? - That clause you asked for
must be taken out again.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.720
What clause?
- That new clause you had them add.

07:45.080 --> 07:48.800
It's on speaker.
Sorry, please give us a moment.

08:01.240 --> 08:05.480
We have to rephrase that clause
in a way that suits both parties.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.360
Fine. Meet in the middle, it's done.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.840
I need to practice my signature,
it's been so long.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.000
Shall we take a photo?

08:20.000 --> 08:20.840
There.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.960
Congratulations.
- Thanks. Likewise.

08:26.360 --> 08:29.920
Hasan now has the trainer
he originally wanted.

08:30.280 --> 08:35.440
So it's important that everything
works perfectly with Julian Nagelsmann.

08:35.800 --> 08:40.400
Hasan's experience with Hansi at the end
was certainly an important lesson,

08:40.840 --> 08:44.640
but for him this is a new beginning,
with Julian Nagelsmann.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.960
I am absolutely convinced we will be
very successful with this trainer.

08:52.720 --> 08:58.720
MAY 4, 2021
SÄBENER STRASSE - FITNESS AREA

09:00.720 --> 09:01.720
Okay, men.

09:02.240 --> 09:06.240
Yesterday the club's future
was clarified.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.960
I know that Julian is a very good coach.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.800
I texted him right away that
he'll have great fun with the team.

09:13.160 --> 09:18.480
I am totally convinced of that,
due to your great skills and attitude.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.680
That's why I'm convinced
this will benefit the club very much.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.280
Any comments or questions?

09:25.640 --> 09:26.920
Brazzo?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.280
Nothing?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.920
Right. Now it's important that we
once again increase our focus.

09:34.280 --> 09:38.720
In the last three games I expect you to
give everything for what we've had here.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.400
What's the general mood,
will we win on Saturday?

09:46.840 --> 09:50.720
We'll definitely win, but the mood
is muted. - Really?

09:51.680 --> 09:54.520
It's just a weird situation.
- Sure.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.680
You're so close to becoming champions.

09:58.040 --> 10:02.160
You'll have to kill it one more time.
And a new coach on top of that …

10:03.080 --> 10:04.760
That's only human.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.920
We just have to try to …
- Just get it done.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.120
Check it off and …
- Exactly.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.480
Yeah, we got it.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.720
Everybody riles you. They all
want you to lose, and in the end

10:21.080 --> 10:24.640
you have to come through
and withstand all this pressure.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.600
To me, that actually feels nicer
than somehow being the underdog.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.800
Of course this is a special situation.

10:36.160 --> 10:40.360
Before our game, Dortmund plays
against Leipzig. And if Dortmund wins,

10:40.720 --> 10:44.880
that would make us champions.
That doesn't happen every day.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.200
Wicked!
- That was a foul. He'll bawl him out.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.640
And it's 3-2. There it is!

11:07.320 --> 11:09.040
Thanks to BVB,

11:09.400 --> 11:11.880
FC Bayern are the German champions.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.880
Congratulations!

11:19.320 --> 11:22.760
Okay.
- We're the German champions! - Sure!

11:23.120 --> 11:26.600
Let's go, guys.
- Men, see you tomorrow, I'm off.

11:28.040 --> 11:32.120
We were champions in advance.
During high fives in the locker room

11:32.480 --> 11:35.920
I thought,
"Well, now we'll have to prove that we

11:36.280 --> 11:38.320
really deserve this."

11:40.360 --> 11:42.920
FC BAYERN VS. BORUSSIA MÖNCHENGLADBACH
MAY 8, 2021

12:16.360 --> 12:18.800
Bayern Munich are the German champions.

12:19.640 --> 12:25.280
And Robert Lewandowski is only one goal
away from the historic 40-goal mark.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.640
OLYMPIC PARK - MUNICH

12:37.480 --> 12:39.480
We had pretty much agreed.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.760
Then I had to go to prison.
When I came back …

12:43.560 --> 12:47.160
When I decided to step back
from the presidency in 2019,

12:47.520 --> 12:50.800
one of my reasons was Herbert Hainer,

12:51.160 --> 12:55.120
in whom I had found
an excellent potential successor.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.080
He fits in wonderfully with FC Bayern.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.800
He managed Adidas very successfully,

13:02.160 --> 13:04.880
was on FC Bayern's
supervisory board for years.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.440
When I became CEO at Adidas,

13:07.880 --> 13:09.400
I basically became

13:09.760 --> 13:12.320
the main contact person
for FC Bayern Munich.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.880
And that business relationship
turned into friendship,

13:17.560 --> 13:21.360
which made my love for FC Bayern Munich
grow even stronger.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.800
It is important to me

13:25.160 --> 13:27.800
that FC Bayern continues to stand

13:28.160 --> 13:31.840
for cosmopolitanism, tolerance, respect

13:32.200 --> 13:34.440
and social commitment.

13:36.840 --> 13:41.600
Thank you. Let's get started with
today's supervisory board meeting.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.080
For the former CEO
of a global enterprise

13:45.440 --> 13:48.520
to be sitting in the stands,

13:48.880 --> 13:52.720
getting excited over everything,
getting angry, screaming.

13:53.080 --> 13:58.040
All the emotion that comes out there,
that's always fascinating.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.920
And I think it also
makes you bond in a certain way.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.160
AUDI DOME - MUNICH
FC BAYERN BASKETBALL

14:06.520 --> 14:08.800
Success doesn't only mean winning.

14:09.160 --> 14:13.960
It also means being an inspiration,
representing values, loving the game.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.200
Take off the soccer mask,
put on the basketball mask.

14:17.560 --> 14:21.040
In my inaugural speech I said

14:21.400 --> 14:25.080
I want to be everyone's president
at Bayern Munich. Not only

14:25.440 --> 14:29.640
for men's soccer. I'm also in touch
with our amateur sports,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.440
no matter if it's amateur basketball,
chess or ninepins.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.320
When you go to the Audi Dome
and see the players' commitment,

14:44.040 --> 14:47.360
their motivation,
and their high technical level,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.160
it's just amazing to watch.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.880
Wherever we appear
in professional sports,

14:54.240 --> 14:56.560
be it in men's soccer,
women's soccer or basketball,

14:56.920 --> 14:59.760
we want to be among the best
in Germany and Europe.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.640
Soccer has always been part of my life.

15:03.080 --> 15:07.400
I used to play in Bayern Munich's
women's team myself.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.560
Women's soccer was a long way
from where it is now.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.080
I think I got only 350 Euros per month.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.680
The girls now

15:18.240 --> 15:21.240
have much better
and more professional conditions.

15:26.520 --> 15:31.400
Women's soccer has developed enormously.
Today we have a top European team,

15:31.760 --> 15:34.200
it's really inspiring to watch.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.120
I hope their audiences will increase.

15:37.640 --> 15:41.200
They really deserve to play
in front of more people.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.960
First and foremost
I'm an FC Bayern Munich fan.

15:49.320 --> 15:55.120
I love this club because I've been
following it since my childhood.

15:59.200 --> 16:03.800
Let's say I wasn't privileged.
My parents didn't have time for us.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.840
They were struggling to make ends meet.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.920
They had a butcher's shop,
and we had to help out.

16:11.280 --> 16:16.560
I did everything. I slaughtered pigs,
I made sausages, all sorts of things.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.840
I balanced the cash,
which I was best at.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.240
And therefore, I think,

16:22.600 --> 16:26.720
from a very early age I gained
a certain understanding of business.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.920
After tenth grade
I did an apprenticeship,

16:30.560 --> 16:33.600
then got my high school diploma,
so I could study economics.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.560
During my last year at university
I was often in Munich, and I saw

16:38.920 --> 16:41.720
that the traditional taverns
had been replaced

16:42.080 --> 16:45.240
by bars with long counters,
where people were standing.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.960
I really loved that,
so I opened my own bar in Dingolfing.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.920
My partner and I would
study in the mornings,

16:55.280 --> 16:57.600
go to soccer practice
three times a week,

16:57.960 --> 17:00.920
and on three days we'd work at the bar.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.880
Back then we were adored as footballers

17:04.240 --> 17:07.360
and also as these
barkeepers with long hair …

17:07.880 --> 17:10.880
We were some kind of heroes
in Dingolfing.

17:18.640 --> 17:21.080
Guys, look whom we've brought here.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.560
Good to see you. How are you?

17:23.920 --> 17:25.960
Good to see you. Been a long time.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.280
I'm really happy that we're here.

17:29.640 --> 17:35.360
We need a new push now, after more
than a year that we didn't get together.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.520
We'll fly over to Kansas
in a couple of days.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.960
The NFL. Guys, we worked on that
for a long time. Now they've finally

17:43.320 --> 17:47.120
publicly announced it, and that's
one of the reasons why Jörg is here.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.120
Yeah. Perfect.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.320
Soccer is

17:51.680 --> 17:55.520
the only global sport in existence.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.160
That's soccer.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.960
And the USA
is a very important market for us.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.760
Last year, when the COVID crisis hit …

18:05.120 --> 18:08.720
If you want to position a brand
on a market, you have to be present.

18:09.080 --> 18:13.080
You have to understand the people
and the culture. And we went for that.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.360
In 2014 we opened a New York office.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.760
There are 36 million
active soccer players.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.120
Miami's mayor told me that Miami is

18:30.480 --> 18:34.040
replacing all the baseball fields
with soccer fields.

18:37.160 --> 18:40.040
We need to reach people.
The most important job is

18:40.480 --> 18:43.960
bringing the fans together
and getting closer to the fans.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.040
Internationalization is all about

18:54.480 --> 18:57.160
positioning the FC Bayern brand
more strongly.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.680
And that's exactly what we did.

19:02.160 --> 19:07.320
Two years later we set up a base
in Shanghai and built a team there.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.960
In China we have more than
110 million followers.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.840
In all of Asia
it's just under 400 million,

19:21.200 --> 19:24.760
which is a little over 40 percent
of our global followers.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.920
I want to welcome you guys
to FC Dallas. It's so great

19:35.280 --> 19:37.600
to be here in the
National Soccer Hall of Fame.

19:38.720 --> 19:43.560
Dan and I had the privilege of working
with US Soccer to develop this facility,

19:43.920 --> 19:48.040
so the people who helped make soccer
what it is today in the United States

19:48.400 --> 19:50.440
could be properly celebrated.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.720
We met Clark Hunt.

19:53.080 --> 19:57.240
He owns both the Kansas City Chiefs
and the FC Dallas.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.160
FC Bayern are the best in the business.

20:00.520 --> 20:05.680
At the Kansas City Chiefs and FC Dallas
we aspire to have the best people,

20:06.320 --> 20:10.040
so we can help FC Bayern continue
to grow their brand in the US,

20:10.400 --> 20:14.840
and they can help the Chiefs and the NFL
grow their brand in Europe.

20:31.680 --> 20:36.480
We exchange know-how and ideas
about sports, and thus place our brand

20:37.000 --> 20:38.440
on their market.

20:38.800 --> 20:43.000
But at the same time we bring
their brand to Germany or Europe.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.080
Which side of the shirt, the back?
- Yeah.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.720
May 15, 2021
FREIBURG / BREISGAU

20:54.160 --> 20:56.840
The Bayern team
wants to help Robert Lewandowski

20:57.200 --> 21:00.720
score the legendary 40th goal today …

21:01.080 --> 21:03.640
Lewi can become
the first Bundesliga player

21:04.000 --> 21:06.680
to set the record of scoring 41 goals.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.440
So far our club legend Gerd Müller
holds the record with 40 goals.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.640
As long as I remember,
no one has even come close to that.

21:26.280 --> 21:30.000
I have a lot of respect for Gerd Müller
and his record.

21:30.360 --> 21:35.200
But I am a person who believes
he can do that. I can write history.

21:36.960 --> 21:40.200
Lewandowski is gonna try to score
at least one goal today here,

21:40.560 --> 21:43.000
to break that unbreakable record.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.240
SC FREIBURG VS. FC BAYERN
MAY 15, 2021 - PENULTIMATE MATCHDAY

21:46.680 --> 21:48.240
Come on! Go on!

21:48.600 --> 21:51.800
Pass to Alaba, who crosses
to the middle. Thomas Müller.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.040
There's Lewandowski!
That could have been it.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.240
Lewi, score the Gerd Müller goal.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.960
Thomas Müller's foot was stepped on.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.040
The ref awards a penalty to Bayern.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.080
This is Robert Lewandowski's big chance.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.120
There's Robert Lewandowski's 40th goal!

22:57.120 --> 23:00.360
There's a lot of time left.
Maybe he will break that record today.

23:03.320 --> 23:06.920
And it's Robert Lewandowski with the
next opportunity! A great chance ….

23:07.360 --> 23:09.040
Come on, Lewi!

23:09.400 --> 23:11.520
Still not over. What a chance here.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.040
He doesn't really want to do it!

23:14.400 --> 23:18.840
Chance number two basically denied
by Lewandowski himself.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.600
One more, damn it.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.080
There's a good ball. Kimmich,

23:27.440 --> 23:29.760
and Lewandowski with another chance.

23:30.800 --> 23:35.320
Lewandowski equals. He had some
opportunities here to break that record.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.080
He's got one more against Augsburg.

23:38.440 --> 23:42.080
I wish Robert all the best because he
really is an outstanding player.

23:42.520 --> 23:46.640
But actually, deep down I think,

23:47.440 --> 23:51.880
40 by Gerd Müller and 40 by
Robert Lewandowski is a beautiful tie.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.440
MAY 18, 2021 - QUARANTINE TRAINING CAMP
GRASSAU, GERMANY

23:56.200 --> 23:58.000
He's gonna speak French.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.560
I knew that Kingsley,
Ben and Lucas were on the list.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.720
I was a bit nervous. I didn't know
if I was on it. I remembered

24:18.080 --> 24:20.920
what happened when I was injured,
how hard it had been.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.800
THREE MONTHS EARLIER

24:25.160 --> 24:27.920
Get something to carry him off.

24:28.280 --> 24:32.520
Right after the kick
I felt something snap in my thigh.

24:33.160 --> 24:37.320
They did an MRI and told me right away
they'd have to operate.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.400
At that moment I knew
the Euros were over for me.

24:43.520 --> 24:46.720
For two or three weeks
I was totally devastated.

24:48.800 --> 24:53.000
When I started to work out every day,
I saw that I made rapid progress.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.480
If I give it my best,
I know I can get there.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.040
Defenders: Lucas Digne, Léo Dubois,

25:03.000 --> 25:04.920
Lucas Hernandez,

25:05.280 --> 25:07.280
Presnel Kimpembe,

25:08.280 --> 25:10.000
Benjamin Pavard,

25:12.440 --> 25:13.680
Kurt Zouma,

25:14.560 --> 25:16.080
N'Golo Kanté,

25:16.440 --> 25:17.400
Corentin …

25:51.520 --> 25:54.000
Hey, tell him to go his room.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.080
That's typical Alexander Nübel!

26:19.360 --> 26:23.120
Let's do some classic ones. Bring it on.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.680
Group one!
- Poor shot.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.760
Do Tomislav Piplica!

26:35.560 --> 26:36.880
Piplica?

26:40.520 --> 26:46.160
Manuel has a really dry sense of humor.
You wouldn't expect that from him.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.760
Jens Lehmann.
- Lehmann?

26:49.320 --> 26:52.280
No, Lehmann's style is
peeing behind the goal.

26:54.520 --> 26:58.440
We both came in during the 2011/2012
season. Manu had a rough start too,

26:58.800 --> 27:00.120
coming from Schalke.

27:04.240 --> 27:07.040
NEUER, YOU'LL ALWAYS REMAIN A GUEST!
NO NEW GUY!

27:09.560 --> 27:13.360
When we wanted to sign him,
there was this huge campaign

27:13.720 --> 27:16.480
with "No new guy" banners.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.920
After they'd seen him play a few times,
they realized,

27:20.280 --> 27:23.840
"There's nothing we can do.
We have the world's best goalie."

27:24.200 --> 27:28.120
This is dangerous, Welbeck alone
going for goal … Unbelievable!

27:28.480 --> 27:31.520
Oh my Lord!
- Ronaldo is foiled by Neuer.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.720
His presence too.
When you're on the field,

27:35.240 --> 27:39.560
you look around, you see Manuel Neuer.
You think, we have Manuel Neuer.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.800
His presence alone gives you confidence.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.320
And he can dribble.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.600
Neuer is miles away from his goal.
This is incredible!

27:49.960 --> 27:52.640
Manu is a world-class player and person.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.880
Haaland's chance to take the lead …
Nope! Manuel Neuer, great!

27:57.840 --> 28:00.480
He stands for continuity.

28:00.840 --> 28:05.400
He became team captain after me.
He's the face of this club.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.520
Even if some shots get through,
you know Manu's there

28:09.880 --> 28:13.600
to saves even the impossible ones.
And not only once.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.160
He has made impossible saves
very, very often.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.640
He is probably the best
soccer goalkeeper in history.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.840
Actually he is both goalkeeper
and outfield player.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.120
World champion,
multiple World's Best Goalkeeper,

28:31.560 --> 28:36.120
two-time Champion's League winner,
multiple German champion and cup winner.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.560
And yet he has remained
incredibly humble.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.720
A pro player's private life
has to take a back seat.

28:43.160 --> 28:47.000
When my grandpa was still alive
and celebrated his 90th birthday,

28:47.360 --> 28:49.640
I wasn't able to visit him.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.640
Things like that really hurt.

28:54.280 --> 28:57.520
My whole family
has always been supportive.

28:57.880 --> 29:02.080
It's a shame that on days like that
you can't just be there for them.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.280
Basically, for your best friend.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.600
It's over. Last training.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.000
One more.
- What? - Kick in one more.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.280
Goal!

29:28.400 --> 29:30.840
World's best goalkeeper, my ass.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.520
There are a few beers left,
if you want one.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.040
Let's start by drinking to someone

29:40.400 --> 29:45.280
who equaled Gerd Müller's record today,
Lewi, congratulations once again.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.880
You know that a few important people

29:53.240 --> 29:57.680
will leave us. Probably. With FC Bayern
you can never be sure. Right, Brazzo?

29:59.760 --> 30:02.760
Right. With David, Jérôme, and Javi,

30:03.720 --> 30:07.600
I think we've ushered in
a very successful era.

30:07.960 --> 30:12.200
David was already here. Thomas was
part of everything too, of course.

30:12.800 --> 30:17.240
We're family here, so the club
and all of us will miss you very much.

30:17.600 --> 30:21.560
And I'm really grateful I got the chance
to play with you.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.240
Roll it!

30:29.760 --> 30:33.000
David is a real FC Bayern legend.
He represents the club,

30:33.360 --> 30:35.800
he came from its own youth team.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.760
Klinsmann was the first to let me
train with them. With van Gaal

30:40.200 --> 30:42.520
I became much more
involved with the pros.

30:42.960 --> 30:47.000
I'm still a young player, and I try to
pull out all the stops in workouts

30:47.360 --> 30:50.600
in order to establish myself
as a professional.

30:51.320 --> 30:54.240
I gave all I had
in every single training session

30:54.600 --> 30:57.720
and I got a role as a sub,
and got to play more,

30:58.080 --> 31:00.080
and finally made my first appearance.

31:00.440 --> 31:06.080
And now van Gaal makes a substitution,
sending a young left-back into the game.

31:06.520 --> 31:10.320
A left-back who later also played
in midfield and central defense.

31:10.680 --> 31:14.400
Back then, that left-side attack
with Franck Ribéry,

31:14.920 --> 31:17.000
I think that was unique.

31:18.320 --> 31:22.880
I said, "Little brother, I'll help you.
What do you need?" He was cute.

31:23.400 --> 31:27.240
In 2012 Jérôme and I
both started playing for FC Bayern.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.720
We transferred at the same time.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.840
All that was new to me,
and I felt honored to go to Munich.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.480
But I admit it wasn't an ideal start.

31:43.080 --> 31:46.800
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL
FC BAYERN VS. CHELSEA FC - MAY 19, 2012

31:47.400 --> 31:49.640
To play the final at home
in our own stadium …

31:50.080 --> 31:52.560
THE CUP IS OURS
The atmosphere from the Bayern fans

31:52.920 --> 31:54.160
is incredible.

31:54.520 --> 31:55.920
THE CUP STAYS HOME

31:56.360 --> 31:59.800
The players were under
incredible pressure. The entire city

32:00.320 --> 32:02.040
was a red-and-white orgy.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.760
The atmosphere was amazing here.

32:07.120 --> 32:10.240
It clearly showed
FC Bayern's importance for the city.

32:10.600 --> 32:15.360
I was happy and thought, "Today we'll
win the Champions League in Munich."

32:18.200 --> 32:22.880
The final at home may have been the most
incredible event in my entire career.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.560
And Thomas Müller scores!

32:31.920 --> 32:35.560
The feeling after that goal,
when the stadium exploded …

32:36.640 --> 32:38.400
The city exploded.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.640
It wasn't just joy over a goal.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.600
Everyone's eyes were popping.

32:45.960 --> 32:49.240
It was like
all of Bavaria had goosebumps.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.720
We played a good game.

32:56.360 --> 32:57.600
1-0.

32:57.960 --> 33:01.880
Not one of our best matches,
but Chelsea didn't do anything.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.040
And then comes Drogba …

33:06.520 --> 33:10.280
The first corner of the game
for Chelsea, with two minutes to go.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.440
And it's in!

33:12.880 --> 33:15.560
Didier Drogba scores.

33:19.560 --> 33:23.920
I'd say the match went as fatally wrong
as it possibly could.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.040
You lead 1-0 in the 89th minute.
There's extra time.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.440
You get a penalty kick.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.040
Arjen Robben misses.
There's a penalty shootout.

33:34.960 --> 33:39.920
If Manuel Neuer is picked to take
a penalty, that's a really bad sign.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.520
Established players ducked out,

33:44.880 --> 33:47.720
simply dodging the responsibility.

33:48.440 --> 33:51.840
We were leading 3-1.
Then no one else scored.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.520
That was definitely
my most bitter defeat.

34:06.160 --> 34:10.920
Right afterwards I saw the
faces of the fans, and I just hid.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.360
It was too hard to grasp.

34:22.720 --> 34:26.080
For two or three days I didn't eat,
that's how down I was,

34:26.440 --> 34:27.760
how frustrated.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.400
After that match …

34:31.560 --> 34:33.920
I'm telling you, my life …

34:34.440 --> 34:36.720
It felt like a nightmare.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.040
Really bad.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.120
About two hours later
I drove through Munich.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.480
The streets were empty!
Worse than during COVID.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.920
It was the last game of the season.

34:49.760 --> 34:53.200
For a few days I didn't go to the club.
Hardly anyone felt up to it.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.280
The facility was practically deserted.

34:56.720 --> 35:01.160
Jupp Heynckes phoned every day, totally
motivated to get the team going again.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.440
For two weeks it only went downhill
on the transfer market.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.120
When we met for the first
training session of the new season,

35:08.480 --> 35:13.400
I gathered the team around me,
and I told them, "Guys,

35:14.040 --> 35:18.240
I'm telling you, this season
we're going to win everything."

35:18.600 --> 35:21.680
GERMAN SOCCER LEAGUE SEASON 2012/13

35:23.520 --> 35:26.680
It's a pass in by Phillip Lahm.
Schweinsteiger, wonderful back heel,

35:27.120 --> 35:28.960
and Bayern Munich are up by a goal.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.240
A defeat is always
more motivating than a win.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.520
At FC Bayern, the only thing
you can't do is stay down.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.000
But we had this team spirit,
and we said,

35:39.360 --> 35:42.000
"We won't let it get us down.
We'll attack again."

35:42.360 --> 35:45.960
During this season
the team grew together,

35:46.320 --> 35:48.160
like a large family.

35:48.800 --> 35:53.720
Our energy level
was even higher than before.

35:55.440 --> 36:00.240
Physically we were so strong and fit,
and they all fought for each other.

36:00.600 --> 36:04.400
Every one of them went to his limit,
and from that moment on

36:04.760 --> 36:07.720
they just pushed right through
with outstanding games.

36:08.280 --> 36:09.560
There's Müller!

36:09.920 --> 36:13.720
By and by I recognized
the amazing spirit within this team,

36:14.080 --> 36:18.120
and I told them,
"We can win something really big."

36:18.720 --> 36:22.120
Javi, as a new player,
was crucial to this.

36:29.040 --> 36:33.000
Even before the final against Borussia
Dortmund I was convinced we'd win.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.920
But a Champions League final
is also a matter of nerves.

36:37.360 --> 36:41.200
Welcome to Wembley, to the Champions
League final between Borussia Dortmund

36:41.560 --> 36:44.760
and Bayern Munich, who are so desperate
to improve from last year.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.440
Dortmund had come very close

36:47.800 --> 36:51.240
and even overtaken them at times,
and they don't like that.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.480
We were runners-up in the league,
for instance.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.560
And we lost the cup
against Dortmund too.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.920
Dortmund are taking them apart
with counterattacks.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.920
2013 the empire struck back.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.800
They had a fantastic team,

37:15.160 --> 37:19.520
played great football, even that year,
especially in the Champions League.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.840
Then you're in London,
in the venerable Wembley Stadium,

37:24.800 --> 37:27.600
with an incredible weight
on your shoulders.

37:28.600 --> 37:32.160
The first 20 minutes we were under
great pressure and didn't play freely.

37:32.600 --> 37:36.960
We made a lot of small mistakes.
The Dortmund match was really tough.

37:37.640 --> 37:41.640
After 20 minutes, it was through Javi
that we found our game,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.480
through the one-on-ones
and his dynamic play.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.920
The great thing was that we overcame it.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.120
And that is only possible
with team spirit and mutual support.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.320
Nutmegged, Robben, with the left.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.840
There it is, 1-0 for Bayern!

38:02.400 --> 38:04.800
So right now Bayern are on the way

38:05.160 --> 38:07.000
to the treble.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.240
Dante, that was clumsy!
That's a penalty.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.840
And now Gündoğan, short run-up.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.320
1-1!

38:20.360 --> 38:22.920
It's all back to square one.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.960
They all went to their limit,
or even beyond.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.720
They have Lewandowski under control now.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.120
Ribéry. Ribéry!

38:36.480 --> 38:37.560
Robben!

38:38.320 --> 38:40.640
Robben, now he scores!

38:45.840 --> 38:47.600
It was like an explosion.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.560
This feeling of joy

38:49.920 --> 38:53.280
was something I had never even
experienced as a player.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.040
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE WINNERS 2013

39:09.560 --> 39:13.520
We had kind of played ourselves
into a frenzy, winning all those titles.

39:13.880 --> 39:15.520
GERMAN CHAMPIONS 2013

39:15.960 --> 39:16.920
German champions!

39:18.280 --> 39:20.240
The three players who are leaving

39:20.600 --> 39:24.160
have made the club what it is today,
in terms of sports.

39:24.520 --> 39:28.320
All of them won the treble twice
while they were here.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.320
MAY 22, 2021
LAST DAY OF GERMAN SOCCER LEAGUE

39:54.960 --> 39:57.160
The storks were often

39:57.680 --> 39:59.520
To be envied

40:00.320 --> 40:01.960
Today I fly

40:02.560 --> 40:03.920
Much further away

40:05.240 --> 40:07.040
I mostly see you

40:07.960 --> 40:09.680
Just from afar

40:11.080 --> 40:12.800
Who understands

40:13.160 --> 40:15.320
How much that sometimes hurts?

40:15.680 --> 40:18.680
No matter what I do

40:19.040 --> 40:21.400
That's where I'm from,
where I belong

40:21.760 --> 40:24.280
That's where the ice melts from my soul

40:24.640 --> 40:27.280
Just like a glacier in April

40:27.640 --> 40:31.160
I am the apple, you're my tree

40:33.120 --> 40:37.040
FC BAYERN VS. FC AUGSBURG
MAY 22, 2021

40:38.320 --> 40:41.800
At least there are 250 fans here
who are cheering.

40:42.160 --> 40:46.640
Of course, today is a day of goodbyes.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.600
Bayern Munich have quite literally

40:49.960 --> 40:52.960
one goal to help Robert Lewandowski
break the record.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.600
Now, the next ball into the center,
and two fantastic saves!

41:01.200 --> 41:05.080
Serge Gnabry scores the next goal!
They're trying to make it happen.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.480
I think it might be an own goal.

41:12.480 --> 41:15.480
The follow-up shot by Lewandowski …
unbelievable.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.040
Kimmich. What a strike!

41:26.840 --> 41:27.800
Coman!

41:28.520 --> 41:31.280
Everyone's scoring except Robert.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.080
Sané, Sané takes the shot!

41:37.960 --> 41:42.080
It's Lewandowski in front of goal!
And Robert Lewandowski does it!

41:42.600 --> 41:44.560
He did it! Lewandowski

41:44.920 --> 41:47.560
did it.
No. 41, there it is!

41:47.920 --> 41:50.160
He wanted to, couldn't do it,
did it anyway.

41:54.040 --> 41:57.400
That I broke this record
in the last minute,

41:57.760 --> 42:01.520
that's a historical event.
I know what this means,

42:01.880 --> 42:04.760
not only for Germany
but for European soccer.

42:05.120 --> 42:08.800
That's why I'm very proud
and grateful to my team.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.800
I love you.
- Right back at you.

42:48.040 --> 42:52.920
The time we had together …
Nobody can take that away from us.

42:53.280 --> 42:56.240
Our years together
were incredible and beautiful.

42:57.160 --> 43:00.880
Even off the football field
we had some really great times.

43:10.440 --> 43:14.080
41 goals in one season!

43:17.520 --> 43:19.080
These last few days

43:19.640 --> 43:24.000
have been tough and sad.
But of course I'm content.

43:24.720 --> 43:28.520
And I'm very happy to have played here.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.320
This way, for me it was

43:35.680 --> 43:38.360
a great finish
with a great team of coaches.

43:40.240 --> 43:43.040
If Hansi had stayed with FC Bayern,

43:43.400 --> 43:45.800
I would have liked to stay as well.

43:48.360 --> 43:52.360
I've had a wonderful time. I've been
a Bayern fan since my childhood.

43:52.720 --> 43:56.640
And after playing here,
I'd never have expected

43:57.000 --> 43:59.400
to come back as a coach.

43:59.760 --> 44:04.360
So I'm totally proud of
what we've achieved as a team.

44:04.720 --> 44:08.160
And, of course,
it was a great honor for me.

44:09.600 --> 44:13.440
Bayern has always been close to
his heart, so he always dreamed

44:13.800 --> 44:16.240
of becoming FC Bayern's head coach.

44:17.560 --> 44:21.800
I've had the privilege to work
with world-class coaches.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.440
Hansi was the most successful of them.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.600
Besides, he is incredibly kind.

44:28.960 --> 44:32.640
He's a fantastic coach
and a fantastic human being.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.120
It hurts to see him leave.

44:35.480 --> 44:39.720
But all our achievements with Hansi
will be remembered forever.

44:40.280 --> 44:43.720
It feels as though he's been head coach
here for 15 years,

44:44.080 --> 44:48.800
but it was only one and a half.
And with all the titles he has won …

44:49.680 --> 44:52.680
Well, I'm basically lost for words.

44:54.680 --> 44:57.080
We should be grateful to him, but he

44:57.440 --> 45:01.280
may also be grateful to FC Bayern,
because we gave him this chance.

45:01.640 --> 45:04.760
Which he grasped admirably
with both hands,

45:05.120 --> 45:10.840
rewarding us and our fans with all those
titles and beautiful soccer games.

45:11.680 --> 45:14.720
It's been amazing to be part of this.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.600
It's a great club,

45:16.960 --> 45:20.920
which has always been close to me,
even when I was a young boy.

45:21.280 --> 45:25.480
So I wish everyone there all the best.

45:37.080 --> 45:38.040
Hello!

45:40.920 --> 45:43.960
We used to walk in here saying,
"Today we'll win!"

45:45.240 --> 45:47.640
It worked only once. But it did.

45:49.880 --> 45:53.760
"Welcome Julian." Great guy.
- Also on a personal level.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.640
Do you prefer a particular side?

45:59.000 --> 46:00.040
No.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.040
Where shall we do it?

46:08.880 --> 46:12.640
Let's do it like this.
- Right. - Adjusting the settings …

46:14.800 --> 46:17.120
Okay, I just have to focus for a second.

46:17.480 --> 46:21.480
Julian Nagelsmann has big shoes to fill
as Hansi Flick's successor.

46:21.840 --> 46:25.840
Now it will be exciting to see
what Julian will change and improve.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.560
There's not a lot
he can do better, really,

46:28.920 --> 46:30.960
as Hansi Flick did such a great job.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.320
Focus …

46:36.680 --> 46:37.680
and go!

46:38.040 --> 46:41.040
Quick, quick, go, go!
Come on, do the steps.

46:47.600 --> 46:51.440
Dealing with players who have
won everything is more demanding

46:51.800 --> 46:55.760
than dealing with players who
haven't been professionals for long.

46:56.120 --> 46:59.480
But I've found that
the boys are eager to improve

46:59.840 --> 47:02.600
and want to live by the motto,
"Always keep going."

47:03.280 --> 47:05.520
First of all, welcome everyone.

47:07.040 --> 47:10.120
I'm happy that we're starting again.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.120
I wanted to welcome the head coach
and his team.

47:16.520 --> 47:20.280
Xaver Zembrod,
Dino Toppmöller, Benji Glück,

47:20.800 --> 47:22.000
welcome.

47:22.920 --> 47:27.400
I welcome you to the preparation
for the new season.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.840
I'm very happy to be here
and to be Bayern Munich's coach.

47:32.280 --> 47:36.080
Every one of you can use the opportunity
to bring yourself more into focus.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.760
Give me some time
to assess you in units.

47:39.120 --> 47:43.680
If you have questions about your play,
come and see me anytime.

47:44.040 --> 47:47.440
You don't need to knock.
I'm always decent.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.840
All of you hopefully
carry the Bayern gene,

47:51.360 --> 47:53.800
which means,
"always win everything".

47:54.320 --> 47:57.200
We have to win. But we also want to win.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.600
Let's do it. Thank you.

48:00.840 --> 48:05.560
I think every soccer club
expects you to try to win everything.

48:05.920 --> 48:08.920
At Bayern, rather than trying,
it's having to win.

48:09.280 --> 48:11.920
You have to win everything
and claim the titles.

48:18.680 --> 48:21.240
It's a pivotal day in the history
of FC Bayern Munich.

48:21.600 --> 48:24.200
CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has decided

48:24.560 --> 48:28.920
to terminate his contract early,
effective July 1, 2021.

48:29.560 --> 48:32.520
Herbert and I discussed this
a few weeks ago,

48:33.400 --> 48:36.320
and afterwards both of us were convinced

48:36.680 --> 48:40.080
that this is the best time to end it,
on June 30.

48:40.440 --> 48:42.560
The season is over.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.840
Fortunately we won the German league.

48:46.280 --> 48:49.160
I think this is a nice conclusion,

48:49.680 --> 48:52.120
and it's also the right time

48:52.840 --> 48:55.480
to pass the baton on to Oliver.

48:55.840 --> 49:00.240
See you soon. Thank you.
- I'll get in touch when I'm back.

49:00.600 --> 49:04.200
Today is my last day.
All this time I've been

49:04.560 --> 49:08.640
pretty relaxed and rational about it.
But this morning …

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
I always take the same route
from Grünwald,

49:12.440 --> 49:17.360
and normally I float along in traffic
until I arrive in the parking garage.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.240
But today, for the first time,

49:20.600 --> 49:22.960
I felt a little nostalgic.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.360
Bye.
- Thanks.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.000
It will go on.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.600
Even here.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.640
Soccer doesn't stop.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.480
We're entering a decade

50:15.840 --> 50:18.520
that will bring a lot of changes.

50:23.760 --> 50:27.000
We've become champions
nine times in a row.

50:27.360 --> 50:30.160
Now we also want the tenth title.

50:41.200 --> 50:46.600
The club has never rested, and that
has always been its great strength.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.520
And that's inspiring.

51:00.240 --> 51:05.560
People were always up in arms when
a great player retired or changed clubs.

51:07.760 --> 51:12.640
But interestingly, we became
a bit more successful every time.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.480
Success is what we strive for.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.760
And success is our goal.
