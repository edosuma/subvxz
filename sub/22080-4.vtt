WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:12.178
[spectators] Blood, blood, blood!

00:12.262 --> 00:14.014
Hit him, you pussy!

00:14.848 --> 00:16.433
No blood, no porn!

00:17.517 --> 00:19.019
Rip his face off!

00:19.102 --> 00:21.896
You motherfucker!

00:26.735 --> 00:29.904
Gentlemen, tonight is gonna be
the ultimate sleepover--

00:29.988 --> 00:32.699
no parents, no rules, no shirts,

00:32.782 --> 00:35.035
and best of all,
"Hooker Killer: Vatican City."

00:35.618 --> 00:38.038
-What's that now?
-I've read about this game.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.122
I can't believe you got it.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.625
It's rated "CSMBP,"
for "Child Services Must Be Present."

00:42.709 --> 00:45.462
Yeah. I had to show the guy at GameStop
my dick just to get it.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.588
-Worth it.
-Oh, Jay.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.758
So I know your parents
aren't going to be home,

00:49.841 --> 00:52.010
but what about your brothers?

00:52.093 --> 00:55.096
Those guys are manimals. They stabbed
their aunt in the fucking leg.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.099
Val and Curt? They're out all night.

00:58.183 --> 01:03.313
Good. It'll be three almost-teenage boys
and a violent sexual video game.

01:03.396 --> 01:06.900
-I guess that could be fun.
-Oh, Andrew, my sweet boy,

01:06.983 --> 01:09.486
it's going to be the greatest night
of our lives.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.197
Sleepover!

01:13.573 --> 01:16.159
Lucky me! Free shards of glass.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.654
-So what are you guys doing tonight?
-We're having a sleepover.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.781
It's at my house, and you can't come.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.533
We're playing the new "Hooker Killer."

01:56.616 --> 01:58.868
Okay, eww, that game is so misogynistic.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.121
The whole point
is just to kill women with jobs.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.082
Remember, they're not women,
they're hookers.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.459
Stop quoting your dad's
stupid law commercials.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.378
If the ads are stupid,
how come they went viral?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.964
-Because they went bad viral.
-There's no such thing as bad viral!

02:11.047 --> 02:14.676
-Name one thing that's viral that's bad.
-HIV.

02:14.759 --> 02:18.888
You mean the most famous
autoimmune disease in existence?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.056
Come on!

02:20.140 --> 02:22.767
[groans] Jay is such a jerk.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.145
You don't need those gross boys.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.898
-Have your own sleepover.
-With who?

02:28.982 --> 02:33.194
-I don't really have many girlfriends.
-Well, what about them?

02:33.278 --> 02:34.571
Devin and Lola?

02:34.654 --> 02:38.867
[Mistress]  ♪ Popular girls
Walkin' down the hallway ♪

02:38.950 --> 02:42.704
♪ Flat-iron hair
Calling the fuckin' shots ♪

02:42.787 --> 02:45.206
I don't really want to be friends
with the popular girls.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.586
Of course you do.
Everybody wants to be friends with Devin.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.129
She's the queen bee.

02:51.212 --> 02:54.674
And you want their honey. Bzzz.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.385
-Hey, Devin.
-Hey. What's up,  chica ?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.846
Hola, mujer.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.348
I know it is  lasto minuto--  [groans]

03:02.432 --> 03:03.766
I'm just gonna speak in English.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.603
Do you guys maybe want to come
to a sleepover at my house tonight?

03:06.686 --> 03:10.523
Interesting. Yeah, I've been looking
to diversify my friend group.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.775
-Wait, what?
-I could use a smart girl.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.736
-Double wait, what?
-Great!

03:14.819 --> 03:16.988
It'll be fun.
We'll be like  Little Women.

03:17.071 --> 03:20.658
Little women? Are you calling me a midge?
'Cause you're a nobody.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.076
-Lola.
-[Missy] Oh, no.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.496
I think she was probably talking about
the novel  Little Women.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.042
It's a touching story about sticking
together in the face of the Civil War.

03:29.125 --> 03:32.462
Yes, that. Missy, do you want
to come to the sleepover too?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.756
-Ah! I'd love to come.
-What are you doing?

03:34.839 --> 03:38.009
I could use another smart girl there.
These chicks are scary.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.469
I've never been to a sleepover.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.305
There's a nightgown I've been saving
for a very special occasion.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.391
It was my grandmother's. She died in it.
One day I will also pass away.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.602
Maybe in this, who knows?
Maybe during the sleepover. Just kidding!

03:47.685 --> 03:49.979
This is actually gonna be interesting.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.148
-Let's do it.
-Yeah, let's do it.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.152
And Jessi, just like logistically,
Devin is my best friend.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.489
If you get too close to her
I will literally end you.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.616
Yay, a sleepover!

04:02.700 --> 04:05.078
Okay, sweetie, now,
you sure you don't want me to cancel?

04:05.161 --> 04:06.412
-It's fine.
-'Cause I will.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.123
Go have fun with Cantor Dinelle.
I'll be okay.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.792
Dad will be the designated adult.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.253
What do you think the deal is
with Sour Patch Kids?

04:13.336 --> 04:15.505
Probably all come
from different fathers, right?

04:15.588 --> 04:18.174
-"My dad was a lemon."
-"My dad was a purple."

04:18.258 --> 04:20.009
Actually, your dad is a lemon.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.011
-Okay, Shannon.
-Okay, Greg.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.181
[Andrew's Mom] Okay, you have
your salicylic acid,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.058
acne wash, and your scraping brush?

04:27.141 --> 04:29.060
-Got 'em.
-What about your special pillow?

04:29.143 --> 04:32.814
It's not special.
In fact, I might not even take it.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.483
-You're not gonna take "Pilbo Baggins"?
-Mom!

04:35.566 --> 04:38.695
You have been on some
very unexpected journeys together.

04:38.778 --> 04:42.615
Yes, I'm being made fun of for coming up
with an awesome name for my pillow.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.368
-Goodbye, Mrs. Glouberman.
-Goodbye, sweetheart.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.536
Bye, Mom.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.664
Remember, Andrew-- be afraid of things.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.082
Okay, love you too, Mom.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.085
-Hi.
-Hi, Jessi.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.921
Your house is beautiful,
but your driveway needs to be repaved.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.673
These are my parents,
they're both professors.

04:58.756 --> 05:03.344
Holy smokes! Your dog
looks like Nathan Fillion.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.679
Did you see  Firefly ?

05:04.762 --> 05:07.307
Sort of a Western sci-fi
genre hybrid, but--

05:07.390 --> 05:09.434
look at ol' Dad geeking out again.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.603
If you're a geek,
then I don't wanna be cool.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.938
Okay.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.692
Missy, here are your snacks--
edamame and carrots.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.569
Sugar makes me spazz out.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.405
She has what the Incans call
"la fuerza de azúcar."

05:22.488 --> 05:23.573
"Sugar strength"!

05:23.656 --> 05:25.658
Maybe we should lay down
some ground rules.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.370
I know we're not doing bedtimes,
but maybe we can sleep in shifts.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.332
-I'd hate to lose my Saturday.
-No, just relax.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.624
Tonight is gonna be baller.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.461
It will be baller than most...
anything else.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.671
-Am I using that at all right?
-No.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.257
Go around to the side!
Kids can't use the front door.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.300
Clients only.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.760
-Hi, Jay.
-Hey.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.013
This place looks like
the Holocaust Museum.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.599
-Big dog!
-Oh, God, big dog!

05:49.682 --> 05:51.601
That's just our pit bull,
Featuring Ludacris.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.978
He won't hurt you guys,
will you, Featuring Ludacris?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.855
Are you a good featured artist?

05:55.938 --> 05:57.815
He's grumpy, 'cause he has
a rare medical condition

05:57.899 --> 05:59.692
that makes him aware
of his own existence.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.110
[whines]

06:02.028 --> 06:03.196
Let me give you the tour.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.698
My bros and I are developing
a shitstorm worth of extreme sports,

06:05.782 --> 06:08.451
like "breakball,"
"golf punch," and "peep-kour."

06:08.534 --> 06:10.787
-"Peep-kour"? wow.
-Have you heard of it?

06:10.870 --> 06:12.288
No, no one ever has.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.707
It's a cross between parkour
and peeping tomfoolery.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.126
Here, watch, check this out.
[grunting]

06:19.045 --> 06:20.171
[Mrs. Albert] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.548
-Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Albert.
-Hi, Jay!

06:22.632 --> 06:23.466
That was awesome.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.635
I got 10 points 'cause I saw
both their buttholes.

06:26.385 --> 06:30.056
I love your kitchen.
It looks so... what is the word?

06:30.139 --> 06:31.974
Shitty. Do you guys have any Cokes?

06:32.642 --> 06:34.060
Yeah, we have Cokes.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.604
Missy, do you want some
unsweetened cranberry juice?

06:36.687 --> 06:38.439
Nope. I want to try a Coke.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.483
Missy, aren't you not supposed
to have sugar?

06:40.566 --> 06:43.152
Oh, my God, what are you,
like, her mom?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.154
Yeah. Are you gonna divorce her dad

06:45.238 --> 06:47.698
and then marry some guy
who lives in another state,

06:47.782 --> 06:50.910
and then sometimes your daughter
has to, like, Uber to school

06:50.993 --> 06:55.915
because it's cheaper for you
to fly back on a Tuesday, or like what?

06:55.998 --> 06:58.084
Jessi, I-I appreciate your concern,

06:58.167 --> 07:01.462
but I'm a part of this group now
and I'd like to try a Coke.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.508
Let's do makeovers, you guys.
Where's your makeup?

07:05.591 --> 07:08.761
I don't have makeup
but I do have sunscreen.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.514
Okay, sweetie,
where's your mom's makeup?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.891
[Jay] Everything I know
I owe to my brothers.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.351
[Nick] Where are Val and Curt?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.229
Oh, man. They're at some bitchin'
high school party tonight.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.022
They made me trim their pubes
before they left

07:20.106 --> 07:23.192
because they are out there
swingin' dicks and bonin' chicks.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.444
Oh, man!

07:25.653 --> 07:27.864
Okay, so, this is our percussion room.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.657
This is the armory.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.325
And this is the door we never open.

07:33.911 --> 07:37.957
And we never open it because
something quite terrible is behind it...?

07:38.040 --> 07:40.334
Andrew, it's the door
we never open. Okay.

07:40.418 --> 07:44.589
And finally, this is where
the magic happens.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.924
-Literally.
-Jesus!

07:48.092 --> 07:50.720
Was that a pigeon spray-painted white
to look like a dove?

07:50.803 --> 07:53.055
-A magician never reveals his secrets.
-[Nick] Okay.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.267
Now, there's someone very special
I want you guys to meet.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.978
-That's a pillow.
-No, no, no, no.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.481
She's so much more than a pillow.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.651
Marrone.  Don't you want
to just stick your dick in her?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.487
Hey, what's that, now?

08:07.570 --> 08:11.157
-Jay, do you... fuck the pillow?
-Yeah, my same question.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.910
Oh, yeah, guys, I fuck my pillow.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.581
I'm sorry, my tone was off.
Yes, I 100-percent fuck my pillow.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.500
First, I make a slit.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.085
Not too long,
careful as to not rip the edges,

08:23.169 --> 08:25.171
making what I call "the husband stitch."

08:25.254 --> 08:27.256
Then, I take two Ziploc bags

08:27.340 --> 08:29.258
and I fill them
with Amy's Organic Lentil Soup,

08:29.342 --> 08:32.512
which I microwave
to exactly 98.6 degrees--

08:32.595 --> 08:36.057
not enough to burn you,
but just enough to feel warm and inviting.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.851
Then I place them
in the slit of the pillow.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.772
There's another slit in the back,
but that's only for my birthday.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.358
-This kid might be a genius.
-What do you do for cleanup?

08:45.441 --> 08:46.817
I eat the soup.

08:46.901 --> 08:47.944
It's in the bag!

08:48.027 --> 08:50.571
You know, Jay,
Andrew has a special pillow, too.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.114
-Let me see.
-No! God damn it!

08:52.198 --> 08:53.616
Don't touch him, please.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.244
Yours is a him. Interesting, Andrew.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.913
It's okay, big guy.
No one's touching Pilbo.

08:58.996 --> 09:02.124
-That's your special pillow.
-It's not my special pillow.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.919
It's just a pillow.
And it is normal for me

09:05.002 --> 09:07.672
to not want Jay
to stick his penis inside it.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.633
Just a little powder, and  voilà.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.180
I'm sorry, am I gorgeous right now?

09:16.264 --> 09:19.559
Take a selfie of yourself
and get Devin in there,

09:19.642 --> 09:23.020
so everyone knows
that you fucks with the big dogs.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.106
#Stunning.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.317
You should see how long it takes
with this dump truck.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.989
That's funny. We can say terrible things
to each other because we're so close.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.534
Now that I see you all made up
you're like, naturally very pretty.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.911
-Yeah, if you, like, like Jews.
-Lola.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.497
What? We're all joking.
I'm a dump truck.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.292
[Missy yells] Guys!
What should we do next?

09:44.375 --> 09:47.587
Can I drink out of the goldfish bowl?
I won't eat the fish, maybe I will!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.088
Missy, are you okay?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.675
Yeah, you look kind of psycho.

09:52.758 --> 09:56.679
[Missy] Nope, I'm hunky-dory,
or should I say horsey-donkey?

09:56.762 --> 09:59.849
[laughing hysterically]
Make me pretty like Jessi!

09:59.932 --> 10:01.767
Maybe you should have
a drink of water or something.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.644
Maybe you should suck my dick!

10:03.728 --> 10:07.940
I said, make me pretty like Jessi!

10:08.024 --> 10:09.775
Why are you wasting ammo?

10:09.859 --> 10:11.986
[Jay] You are in strangling range. Andrew!

10:12.069 --> 10:14.113
[Andrew] Oh, my God,
they die in real time?

10:14.196 --> 10:16.741
Yeah, you watch their souls
leave their bodies.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.409
A nun's covering her with a blanket.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.785
-[Andrew] This is fucked-up.
-[Jay] Grab the soul!

10:19.869 --> 10:21.996
-Grab the soul!
-[Andrew] I got the coins, here you go.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.748
Okay, wash your bloody hands
in the fountain,

10:23.831 --> 10:25.791
-and we gotta get outta here.
-Oh, a gela-teria.

10:25.875 --> 10:26.917
It's pronounced  gelate-ria.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.003
How many coins do you have?
We can both buy a gelato.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.421
[Andrew] Hey, what the hell?

10:30.504 --> 10:32.548
I'm sorry, were you
in the middle of a game?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.592
Val, Curt, don't be assholes!

10:34.675 --> 10:36.427
Yeah, don't be assholes,
you fucking assholes.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.512
I thought you guys
were at a cool high school party.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.806
We did make an appearance,
grabbed some tit.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.017
That part was rad.
But when you get to be our age,

10:43.100 --> 10:45.936
you'll see those parties,
they're full of fakers, full of skanks.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.190
Would you two care to play some
"Hooker Killer: Vatican City" with us?

10:49.273 --> 10:51.984
Game for babies.
You guys want to see some real sex?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.027
We already saw your neighbors.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.863
We're talking about one
of the greatest pornographic works

10:55.946 --> 10:57.698
in the history of skinema.

10:57.782 --> 11:02.286
It stars the Italian Stallion himself,
Mr. Sylvester Stallone.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.206
-That's my buddy Frank's brother.
-Did it before he was famous.

11:05.289 --> 11:08.626
Just a struggling actor
with a thick, meaty cock.

11:09.251 --> 11:12.505
Yes. So tired of jacking off
to the ladies from  SportsCenter.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.508
Well, I would certainly not be opposed
to seeing that film.

11:15.591 --> 11:18.511
Today's the day, Andrew Glouberman,
you become a man.

11:18.594 --> 11:19.637
Mazel tov! [yells]

11:20.846 --> 11:24.850
I didn't wrap a napkin around the glass
and I don't wear shoes! Oh, God!

11:24.934 --> 11:27.269
Are you bitches ready?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.479
Here she is.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.191
I love these sock boobs.
They're real bazongas.

11:32.274 --> 11:35.486
-I like grabbing on to 'em.
-That's good, 'cause nobody else will.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.657
Oh, gosh, isn't she tragic, Jessi?

11:39.740 --> 11:43.744
Agree with Devin. She is the alpha,
and she must be satiated.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.996
-No.
-Missy is the weak one.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.706
She must be sacrificed.

11:48.624 --> 11:52.378
She looks like one of the meth heads from
the sex scene in  Dallas Buyers Club.

11:53.546 --> 11:57.049
Oh, my God. I don't know what
that movie is, but that sounds spot-on.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.052
Let's do nails. Let's paint them up.
I want to do nails!

12:00.136 --> 12:04.223
-Do my nails or suck my dick!
-I am so glad you invited her.

12:04.306 --> 12:06.392
Every party needs entertainment.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.562
Normally I would just have Lola
spread a rumor about herself.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.148
I'm lesbians with my mom.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.399
[Curt and Jay grunt]

12:13.732 --> 12:16.235
This is crazy.
Why is Jay doing this?

12:16.318 --> 12:19.196
You're an only child. You don't get it.
This is how brothers are with each other.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.699
He's right. My brother's a real asshole.
Want to see a picture?

12:21.782 --> 12:23.325
I fuckin' love this guy.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.495
Oh, my God! Is he dead?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.789
Jesus, Jay, are you okay?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.082
How long was I out?

12:30.166 --> 12:33.127
My record is two and a half minutes.
Let's do it again!

12:33.210 --> 12:35.588
Nah. I want to see these gaywads fight.

12:35.671 --> 12:39.133
-No, no, no.
-Thank you, Curt, but I think we're good.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.551
-Oh, you're good?
-Yeah.

12:40.634 --> 12:44.221
Okay, they're good.
Well, eat my swampy ass, bitch!

12:44.305 --> 12:47.183
You want to see porn?
You gotta pay for it in blood.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.019
Blood for sex?
That's some old-school shit. I'm into it.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.396
Blood. Nick, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.522
Sure.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.277
-Look, I don't want to fight you.
-I don't want to be here at all.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.488
Think we can just, you know,
pretend to fight.

13:00.571 --> 13:04.867
Yeah, maybe throw a couple soft,
fake hits and then it's porn city.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.327
-What could go wrong?
-What could go wrong?

13:06.410 --> 13:09.038
-[crowd noise]
-Ladies and gentleturds,

13:09.121 --> 13:11.916
welcome to the octagon of death.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.085
In this corner,
weighing in at practically nothing,

13:15.169 --> 13:18.339
it's "Polly Pocket" herself,
the "Lilliputian Leprechaun,"

13:18.422 --> 13:20.299
Saint Nick!

13:20.382 --> 13:22.092
BLOOD! BLOOD! WE REQUIRE BLOOD!

13:22.176 --> 13:24.345
One at a time!
Vegas odds only!

13:24.428 --> 13:27.389
And in this corner:
the "Fiddler on the Roof,"

13:27.473 --> 13:31.644
the "Pubescent Delicatessen,"
the Gloubermensch!

13:31.727 --> 13:33.270
Now fight!

13:33.354 --> 13:34.772
-Little right.
-Yeah, there you go.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.065
Rip his face off!

13:36.148 --> 13:37.441
-Sorry.
-No, no, we're good.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.901
-Too hard?
-No blood, no porn!

13:38.984 --> 13:39.944
-Nice hook.
-Thank you.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.404
Kiss! Kiss on the mouth!

13:43.155 --> 13:45.407
Oh, shit! Are you okay?
I'm sorry, man.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.786
I'm bleeding, you asshole!

13:48.869 --> 13:50.412
Blood? Blood.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.499
Don't think, react!
Tear his fucking head off!

13:53.582 --> 13:55.626
-Motherfucker!
-Ow!

13:56.418 --> 13:59.922
Jesus! What the hell?
We were supposed to be pretending.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.590
[grunting and gasping]

14:01.674 --> 14:04.468
Tear his face off!
Hit him with the  hai...

14:04.552 --> 14:06.470
-Get off me!
-[Val and Curt laugh]

14:06.554 --> 14:08.597
This is even better than
"Killing Hookers."

14:09.348 --> 14:11.767
Okay, Jessi, who do you have a crush on?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.311
-And you can't say nobody.
-I have a crush!

14:14.395 --> 14:16.605
It's TV's Nathan Fillion.
I wanna kiss him.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.108
I don't know who that is,
so he sounds stupid.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.318
Au contraire,  Nathan Fillion's a hunk!

14:21.402 --> 14:24.989
Oh, man, I should stop her.
She's on a serious sugar high.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.867
Hush, puppy. Let her dig her own grave.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.202
Sometimes I like to imagine a scenario
where we're friends

14:30.286 --> 14:31.662
and we solve crimes, like  Castle,

14:31.745 --> 14:33.581
but the crimes are in space,
like  Firefly,

14:33.664 --> 14:38.502
and then we fall in love, but we stay
best friends at the same time.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.546
Missy, I'm falling in love with you,

14:40.629 --> 14:43.382
but I also want to stay best friends
with you at the same time.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.092
Oh, Nathan Fillion.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.177
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you

14:47.261 --> 14:49.179
solving space crimes, doing homework,

14:49.263 --> 14:50.764
and listening
to  Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.892
But first, let's dance the merengue.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.103
Because I spent time in Latin America
and understand other cultures.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.439
You are so beautiful, Missy.

14:58.522 --> 15:02.818
-May I kiss you with my mouth?
-Of course, Nathan Fillion.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.614
-Ruff! Ruff!
-[dog barking]

15:07.406 --> 15:08.240
Nathan Fillion?

15:09.491 --> 15:12.661
-Oh, my God, this is the best thing ever.
-[laughs] Oh, my God.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.079
Missy, what is wrong with you?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.040
What? Why? Why are you mad at me?

15:16.123 --> 15:19.960
I'm mad because you're so weird.
Why can't you be more normal?

15:20.711 --> 15:24.340
You're being really mean, Jessi.
I thought we were gonna be friends.

15:24.423 --> 15:28.719
I am trying to be your friend,
but you make it so hard!

15:28.802 --> 15:30.262
Stop yelling at me.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.390
All I wanted was to be
a part of a fun sleepover--

15:34.141 --> 15:37.186
-[Lola] Oh, my God!
-No! Darn it, Nathan Fillion.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.479
Don't eat that.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.440
-Are we having fun or what?
-Or what.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.109
Please, it wasn't on purpose.
You leaned into the punch.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.319
Eat shit.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.905
Okay, look,
let's lighten the mood a little.

15:47.988 --> 15:51.116
You know what we need?
To harness the healing power of magic.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.494
You gonna pull a rabbit out of your butt?

15:53.577 --> 15:55.496
-Magic's gay.
-Magic is not gay.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.247
-It transcends sexuality.
-Gay.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.916
-You assholes unplugged our game!
-Gay.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.210
You kicked me in the face,
and I take it all...

16:01.293 --> 16:02.795
-Right up your butt?
-Next to the rabbit?

16:02.878 --> 16:05.756
I fuckin' hate you guys!
These are my friends,

16:05.839 --> 16:09.468
and you ruined
a whole night sleepover!

16:10.010 --> 16:12.262
You guys are the worst! [crying]

16:13.806 --> 16:16.100
All right, next task:
you guys have got--

16:16.183 --> 16:17.810
No! No next task.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.688
You said if we fought each other
we could watch a porno.

16:20.771 --> 16:24.149
And we fought each other, brother,
we fought each other!

16:24.233 --> 16:26.610
-So show me the porno.
-Show us the porno.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.071
-We've been through so much!
-Show us the goddamn porno!

16:29.154 --> 16:30.864
All right, jeez! Calm down, ladies.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.658
I didn't realize
it was this important to you.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.327
-We can watch the porno right now.
-Oh, thank God!

16:35.411 --> 16:38.247
Just as soon as we have a light snack.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.418
The name of the game is "Jizzcuit,"

16:42.501 --> 16:45.170
AKA "Ookie-Cookie,"
AKA "Cum on a Cracker."

16:45.254 --> 16:47.172
It's very simple.
We stand around in a circle

16:47.256 --> 16:48.716
and jerk off onto a Triscuit.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.384
Last one to come eats it.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.594
Wait, what's that now?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.596
But, and here's why
we're men of our word,

16:54.680 --> 16:58.392
you get to watch the porno
while you jerk off, so everybody wins.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.853
Except for the bitch who has to eat
the cum-soaked cracker.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.897
-[gags]
-Wow, okay, a lot to process here.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.941
On the one hand, we get to watch porn,

17:06.025 --> 17:07.985
but on the other
we might have to eat cum.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.946
But on the third hand,
I'm looking at prepubescent Nick

17:11.030 --> 17:14.366
and I don't think his "frosting factory's"
open for business yet.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.619
But on the fourth hand
that fucker punched you in the face,

17:17.703 --> 17:20.039
so he can eat a dick and a jizzcuit.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.707
[whimpers]

17:23.083 --> 17:26.128
Pardon me, Val, may I see
that cracker for a second?

17:26.211 --> 17:28.255
Sure. It's low-sodium, for now.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.842
What the hell, you assclown?
Now we have to get another Triscuit!

17:31.925 --> 17:33.802
You two, don't go anywhere.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.473
-Nick, we're getting you out of here.
-What? Why?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.893
This has been a terrible night, filled
with many dark and regrettable things.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.812
Years from now we'll talk about this
at a party, thinking it's funny,

17:43.896 --> 17:45.314
and then immediately feel embarrassed

17:45.397 --> 17:47.691
and realize this was almost certainly
child abuse.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.110
-Let's go.
-Do you think we can get out of here?

17:50.194 --> 17:54.948
My dear boy, I make this vow--
no cum shall enter your tummy.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.993
-A broken promise I made to Rod Stewart.
-Is that true?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.912
You're picturing it,
we're talking about it.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.247
-What?
-A callback to the last episode.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.666
They're binge-watching it.
You're binge-watching it, right?

18:05.209 --> 18:08.754
I can't wait for you to see the next one.
Jessi discovers her vagina.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.798
It's a very sex-positive episode.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.091
[vomiting]

18:12.758 --> 18:16.178
[sobbing] You just invited me here
to make fun of me.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.387
No, I didn't.

18:17.471 --> 18:21.016
This is going to be
my harrowing middle-school story

18:21.100 --> 18:22.684
that I tell on  The Moth.

18:23.602 --> 18:27.106
[Devin] Jessi, you have to see this pic
of Missy kissing your dog.

18:27.189 --> 18:30.025
-We're posting it #MissyFit.
-What?

18:30.609 --> 18:33.946
It's awesome. I got her
full-on Frenching your dog.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.866
-Come on, guys, you can't post that.
-No one touches my phone!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.828
Pull her hair out from the roots!

18:41.370 --> 18:44.706
-Let go of the phone!
-Stop trying to make out with me, lesbo!

18:44.790 --> 18:46.542
You're not my mom!

18:46.625 --> 18:48.377
-[Jessi] Let go of my hair!
-[bong burbling]

18:48.460 --> 18:51.338
Rusted Root isn't rusty at all.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.342
♪ On my way
On my way ♪

18:55.425 --> 18:56.343
[yells]

18:57.553 --> 18:58.804
Done. They're deleted.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.265
I hate you. Your house sucks!

19:01.348 --> 19:04.685
My God, I'm a dump truck.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.856
I don't think
you're a very nice person, Jessi.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.524
But I deleted the photo.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.569
But you yelled at me
and you called me weird.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.196
Honestly, Jessi,
there's a special place in hell

19:16.280 --> 19:17.948
for women who don't support other women.

19:18.031 --> 19:21.618
Are you fucking joking, Devin?
You're the ringleader of all of this!

19:21.702 --> 19:24.246
I only went along with it
so you would like me.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.624
I only do everything
so that Devin will like me.

19:28.959 --> 19:32.087
I'm sorry you're all such beta-bitches,

19:32.171 --> 19:35.674
and for your 411-formation,
it's tough being in charge.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.635
You don't know what it's like

19:38.719 --> 19:42.639
being the prettiest
and the most popular girl at school.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.725
You can't know.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.351
God!

19:46.935 --> 19:49.271
"Prettiest" seemed
kinda wedged in there.

19:49.354 --> 19:53.442
[Monster] Soldiers of fortune,
your mission is to escape this house.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.985
Okay, what do we do?

19:55.068 --> 19:57.279
Press my nip. It's the start button.

19:57.821 --> 19:58.780
[videogame sound effects]

20:02.743 --> 20:05.078

think you're going?

20:08.457 --> 20:10.792
-That's coarse!
-Run!

Eat my seed, gaylords! [grunting]

20:17.341 --> 20:18.884
When did he have time to jerk off?

20:21.553 --> 20:22.387
Hyah!

20:22.596 --> 20:25.807
-[yells] It stings!
-But it's worth it!

20:27.517 --> 20:28.644
[Nick] Make a right.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.980
-That's the door they never open.
-Screw that!

20:32.439 --> 20:33.357
[Nick gasps]

20:33.482 --> 20:36.026
Jay's mom was here the whole time?

20:36.109 --> 20:39.196
-You boys havin' fun?
-No. Your sons are insane.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.697
We want to go home.

20:42.074 --> 20:46.036
I didn't realize you were
a bunch of pussies.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.454
-What's that?
-Huh?

20:47.537 --> 20:50.290
Boys! We've got runners!

20:50.374 --> 20:52.960
-My God, she's one of them.
-Come and get 'em!

20:53.043 --> 20:54.002

[slow-motion sound effect]

21:06.014 --> 21:09.184
Oh, my God, we made it.
That was insane!

21:09.268 --> 21:11.895
No. No, no, wait. No.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.730
No, no, this can't be...

21:13.814 --> 21:17.276
Pilbo. Oh, no, I can't leave him
with those monsters, Nick.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.569
Oh, man. I'm really sorry, Andrew,

21:19.653 --> 21:22.364
but we can't go back in there
just for a pillow.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.867
Nick, it's not just a pillow...

21:25.951 --> 21:28.620
it's my special pillow.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.207
-Hey, look at me.
-Oh, my God.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.584
Hey. We're going back in.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.795
We're going to get Pilbo.

21:36.878 --> 21:40.173
Devin! Devin!

21:40.257 --> 21:41.591
We've got to do something.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.594
The neighbors are gonna think
you're sacrificing a goat.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.306
Lola, I want to help you guys make up.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.640
Like, why?

21:48.724 --> 21:52.394
Because I would never want
to come between you and Devin.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.439
Wait, hold on, are you saying
we should kill Devin,

21:55.522 --> 22:00.527
take her skin and wear it, and then
blame the whole thing on Missy, or what?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.947
No. I just think you and Devin
belong together.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.700
Oh, my God,
that's actually, like, very sweet.

22:06.783 --> 22:10.162
Okay, here, just repeat after me.
[whispers]

22:10.287 --> 22:11.705
-Devin...
-[Devin] What?

22:11.788 --> 22:14.249
Are you gonna yell at me
for kissing your stepdad, too?

22:14.333 --> 22:17.336
Wait, what?
I will cut your skin off!

22:17.419 --> 22:19.254
Lola... [whispers]

22:19.463 --> 22:21.631
Okay. Listen, I get it.

22:21.715 --> 22:25.677
It's really hard being in charge
and we're super lucky to have you.

22:25.761 --> 22:26.678
[whispers]

22:27.345 --> 22:29.598
We demand perfection
and that's not fair,

22:29.681 --> 22:33.477
but we only do it because
you're honestly, like, a goddess

22:33.560 --> 22:39.357
and that's why it's so hard to not want to
literally turn you into a human jumpsuit.

22:39.441 --> 22:43.278
-That's all I ever wanted to hear.
-Oh, my God.

22:43.987 --> 22:47.032
-I went off-script there at the end.
-I know.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.910
Wow, you really pulled a Cyrano, Jessi.

22:49.993 --> 22:53.538
Oh, Missy, I'm so sorry I was mean.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.625
And I'm sorry I made you say that stuff.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.336
I just wanted you to be popular

22:59.419 --> 23:01.004
and have flat-iron hair

23:01.088 --> 23:04.007
and call the fucking shots!

23:04.591 --> 23:06.510
And I'm sorry I spazzed out.

23:06.593 --> 23:10.347
This really has been a harrowing ordeal
of emotional brutality.

23:10.430 --> 23:14.226
So, the crying portion of the evening
has concluded,

23:14.309 --> 23:15.936
and now it's time to watch a movie.

23:16.019 --> 23:19.815
Or we could watch  Castle
starring Nathan Fillion.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.817
That sounds good to me.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.903
Damn it, it's not here.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.864
[sniffs] Andrew, do you smell that?

have all your stuff?

23:40.669 --> 23:42.546
Because we have to go home, Jay.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.673
Your brothers are trying
to make us eat jizz.

-Jay, come with us.
-No, Andrew. My place is here.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.100
Go. The window. I'll cover you guys.

Okay, aim for the trampoline.

-Yeah, Andrew?

23:59.479 --> 24:01.356
Can I sleep over at your place?

Sure, Andrew,
if the fall doesn't cripple us

[Kate]  Wait a minute, Castle,
if Arroyo's a trained lifeguard--

24:32.679 --> 24:34.639
[Castle]  Then who was wearing
those water wings?

24:34.723 --> 24:38.560
This show is great.
Their chemistry's undeniable.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.438
We actually shot this scene
day-for-night, L.A. for New York.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.355
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

24:42.439 --> 24:45.150
-You do a heck of a job, my man.
-Thanks. You're too much.

Oh, my God, what a rush, right?

24:48.195 --> 24:49.863
I mean, that's exciting!

24:51.156 --> 24:52.407
Oh, Andrew.

24:52.490 --> 24:55.076
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.704
No, no, no. It's okay, Nick.

24:57.787 --> 25:02.042
It's probably time
for pillows to just be pillows.

25:03.543 --> 25:06.379
But, you know, it's a bummer
we went through all of that

25:06.463 --> 25:08.506
and never got to see Stallone bone.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.968
Actually, I did manage to grab this
on the way out.

We do, but there's this Jane Fonda
workout tape stuck in it.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.440
[Nick] It's kind of amazing that Jay's
not more screwed up than he is, right?

25:25.523 --> 25:27.651
[Andrew] His mom called us pussies.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.403
[Nick] And his brothers make him
for real eat their jizz.

You never know how many people
are inside eating jizz.
