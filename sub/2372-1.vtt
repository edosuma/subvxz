01:14.856 --> 01:17.026
Beautiful day.

01:17.726 --> 01:19.194
Yes, it certainly is.

01:19.294 --> 01:22.164
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

01:22.264 --> 01:23.632
What you reading?

01:24.532 --> 01:27.102
- Poetry.
- I know a poem. Want to hear it?

01:27.202 --> 01:29.597
- No, thanks.
- I love Little Pussy.

01:29.698 --> 01:34.876
Her fur is so warm. And if I don't
hurt her, she'll do me no harm.

01:35.518 --> 01:39.814
What's the matter, don't you like it?
Hey, why don't you and I get some lunch

01:39.914 --> 01:42.150
and you could read
some of those poems to me?

01:42.250 --> 01:43.985
No, thank you.
I prefer to read silently.

01:44.085 --> 01:47.922
Oh, 'cause I'm real hungry
and I hate to eat alone.

01:48.022 --> 01:51.493
Then perhaps a cafeteria-style diner
would suit your needs.

01:51.593 --> 01:53.295
Think you're pretty cute, don't you?

01:53.595 --> 01:55.597
My mother says I have
a certain kind of loveliness

01:55.697 --> 01:59.568
though I believe in the Anasazi Indians
that the face is for others to look at.

01:59.668 --> 02:01.103
Get in.

02:01.803 --> 02:04.439
I'm going to walk away now.
I suggest you let me.

02:05.739 --> 02:07.039
Get in!

02:09.077 --> 02:12.445
- Are you threatening me?
- Get in!

02:17.952 --> 02:19.187
Toodle-oo.

02:33.701 --> 02:38.206
Who saw him die?
"I," said the fly, "With my little eye."

04:36.090 --> 04:39.093
Mother dear,
how do we get blood out again?

04:39.193 --> 04:42.997
<i>I told you, dear.
Lemon juice with equal parts ice water.</i>

04:43.097 --> 04:45.200
<i>If you let it soak long enough,
no one'll know the difference.</i>

04:45.300 --> 04:48.936
- It'll be our little secret.
- We have so many, Mother dear.

04:49.036 --> 04:50.972
Now, tell Mother.

04:51.072 --> 04:54.809
<i>Don't fib. Did you accidentally
cut yourself with a knife again?</i>

04:54.909 --> 04:57.278
No, but don't worry about me,
Mother dear.

04:57.378 --> 05:01.616
- Oh, Mother never stops her worry, Mary.
- You always say that.

05:01.716 --> 05:05.019
- 'Cause it's always true.
- I can take care of myself.

05:05.119 --> 05:08.122
So... what does my little big girl
plan on doing today?

05:08.222 --> 05:11.591
I am substitute-teaching
in a low-income,

05:11.692 --> 05:15.363
racially mixed bottom-scoring,
first-grade classroom.

05:15.463 --> 05:19.701
Oh, you poor darling.
You could have run a charm school

05:19.801 --> 05:23.204
in a soon-to-be bankrupt
department store or been president.

05:23.304 --> 05:25.139
But that wasn't my destiny, Mother.

05:25.239 --> 05:28.376
Well, I hardly think your destiny
is being a temporary teacher.

05:28.476 --> 05:31.512
Well, no one knows
their destiny except... God...

05:31.612 --> 05:35.049
or... a best-selling author.

05:35.149 --> 05:38.786
Well, I just don't understand
why you don't something more permanent.

05:38.886 --> 05:40.722
Permanence is temporary, Mother dear.

05:41.322 --> 05:44.192
Well, I suppose
there's some truth in that, Mary.

05:44.292 --> 05:45.994
The truth is relative.

05:46.794 --> 05:49.664
<i>- I guess I should let you go.</i>
- You'll never let me go.

05:49.764 --> 05:54.033
- Toodle-oo. I love you.
- Toodle-oo. I love you too.

06:13.588 --> 06:17.458
<i>Life is mostly froth and bubble.
Two things stand like stone:</i>

06:17.758 --> 06:22.630
Kindness in another's trouble
and courage in your own.

06:22.930 --> 06:25.767
What the author in this book
is trying to tell us,

06:25.867 --> 06:30.838
that no matter what the most important things
in life are kindness and courage.

06:30.938 --> 06:33.775
Who can tell me an example
of courage in their own lives?

06:33.875 --> 06:35.710
- Miss Meadows, Miss Meadows!
- Gordon?

06:35.810 --> 06:39.181
- Mrs. Meadows?
- It's Miss Meadows. Let's continue.

06:39.281 --> 06:42.983
If you're a "miss," does that mean
you miss having a husband?

06:43.083 --> 06:45.864
Well, that's one interpretation.

06:45.964 --> 06:51.292
Although the other is that I prefer it
that way because I have all of you.

06:51.692 --> 06:54.696
So who has an example for me?

06:55.196 --> 06:57.998
Wow! You thought of one, Heather?

06:58.098 --> 07:00.935
Can I take a snack break now?

07:01.035 --> 07:06.539
No, not yet. Can I help you find
an example of courage?

07:07.408 --> 07:09.377
Well, Mrs. Dodd left us.

07:09.477 --> 07:11.646
Well, Mrs. Dodd isn't here right now.
Miss Meadows is.

07:11.746 --> 07:13.848
She's never coming back.

07:13.948 --> 07:16.584
- Of course she is.
- No, she's not!

07:16.684 --> 07:20.121
My grandma had the same thing
she does and she died.

07:20.221 --> 07:25.124
I saw her in her coffin.
She looked like string cheese.

07:31.933 --> 07:36.737
Well, it sounds like Mrs. Dodd
is an example of courage.

07:36.837 --> 07:39.941
How about we make
"get well soon" cards for Mrs. Dodd

07:40.041 --> 07:44.178
and I will personally see that she gets them?
Are we doing coloured or plain?

07:44.278 --> 07:47.649
- Plain. Coloured!
- Plai... Oh, my goodness!

07:47.749 --> 07:52.286
Mrs. Dodd's got the Big C. Don't fill
those children's minds with false hope.

07:52.586 --> 07:56.023
There are over 13 million cancer survivors
throughout the world.

07:56.123 --> 07:58.292
The only thing false
is not having any hope.

07:58.392 --> 08:01.095
- Is that a fact?
- Yes. For verification,

08:01.195 --> 08:04.365
you can contact
the American Cancer Society.

08:04.465 --> 08:08.534
All right, Miss Meadows.
I've had it up to here with you.

08:12.073 --> 08:14.844
Perhaps you're confusing me with the scarf
around your neck that's in danger

08:14.945 --> 08:19.680
of becoming a tourniquet.
I shall return to Mrs. Dodd's class.

08:19.980 --> 08:23.485
The children don't need
any more changes right now.

08:24.485 --> 08:26.954
I shall give them
as much consistency as I can

08:27.054 --> 08:29.557
which might serve to reassure them
in these troubled times.

08:29.657 --> 08:33.727
- Go home. Your cheque's in the mail.
- I seriously doubt that.

08:33.828 --> 08:39.399
I rarely receive any cheques
through the mail. Toodle-oo.

09:24.511 --> 09:27.848
- Good morning, Mrs. Davenport.
- Good morning, Miss Meadows.

09:27.948 --> 09:32.587
Oh! Your garden looks especially
perky today. What's your secret?

09:34.322 --> 09:39.093
Honestly, coffee grinds
and meticulous weeding.

09:39.193 --> 09:40.528
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:40.628 --> 09:44.932
All right, I'm gonna have to try that.
I just have to say, Miss Meadows,

09:45.032 --> 09:47.468
it is such a pleasure having you
in the neighbourhood.

09:47.968 --> 09:51.205
Ever since you've moved here,
things just feel different.

09:51.305 --> 09:52.873
For the better, I hope.

09:52.973 --> 09:56.444
Oh, yes! I mean,
it's a pleasure to live here again.

09:56.544 --> 09:59.413
I do hope you'll renew
your lease and stay for good.

09:59.513 --> 10:02.382
Stay for good? Good to stay.

10:03.082 --> 10:05.286
What doth the bluebird say?

10:12.393 --> 10:16.731
Miss Meadows,
a new dentist joined Doug's practice

10:16.831 --> 10:21.303
and he's available and we thought
we might fix you two up.

10:22.103 --> 10:25.272
Thank you. But I don't need a dentist.

10:25.372 --> 10:30.011
Oh no, I just meant... Well,
I don't want you to end up an old maid.

10:31.154 --> 10:34.982
That's impossible.
I don't clean houses for a living.

10:35.082 --> 10:38.519
And I have no intentions
to start domestication training.

10:39.619 --> 10:42.357
- Okay.
- But thank you. Ooh...

11:08.816 --> 11:12.785
Careful on the thorns. Toodle-oo.

11:36.443 --> 11:39.180
Oh, it's okay.

11:42.583 --> 11:45.519
Okay. No broken legs.

11:45.619 --> 11:48.355
Good job. Yeah.

11:48.455 --> 11:49.855
Excuse me, miss.

11:51.492 --> 11:53.686
Hello, Sheriff.

11:55.262 --> 11:58.899
Do you have any idea why I pulled over?

11:59.599 --> 12:03.304
Yes. I parked my vehicle illegally
in the middle of the road

12:03.404 --> 12:08.275
which causes the same safety hazard
as leaving a vehicle unoccupied.

12:08.475 --> 12:11.945
But I was concerned
for the safety of this toad.

12:12.345 --> 12:14.781
And there was no on-street parking.

12:14.981 --> 12:18.085
Do you think if I kissed it,
it would turn into a prince?

12:21.655 --> 12:23.258
Maybe.

12:23.858 --> 12:26.427
Or it'll just be one lucky toad.

12:26.527 --> 12:29.997
This is a '56 Metropolitan Nash?

12:30.097 --> 12:33.067
Yeah, it reminds me of an old pair
of saddle shoes I once had.

12:33.167 --> 12:35.803
Reminds me of my grandmother's
kitchen floor.

12:35.903 --> 12:38.632
So clean you could eat dinner off it.

12:38.832 --> 12:41.035
I prefer a table setting.

12:41.174 --> 12:42.943
Right.

12:43.443 --> 12:45.946
Can you... One... Don't move.

12:46.046 --> 12:51.583
Do you think that's really true? That you
can make a difference in this world?

12:57.057 --> 12:58.891
I think it's impossible not to try.

13:00.394 --> 13:02.327
I feel the exact same way.

13:04.832 --> 13:08.269
- What is it you do for a living?
- I teach kids.

13:08.369 --> 13:11.904
- Oh, that's nice.
- My pleasure.

13:16.043 --> 13:18.145
All right, so I think
I'm gonna let you off

13:18.245 --> 13:20.348
- with a warning this time, Miss...
- Meadows.

13:20.448 --> 13:23.484
- Meadows. That's a beautiful name.
- Thank you.

13:23.584 --> 13:24.952
Can I ask where you're from?

13:25.652 --> 13:30.022
"Can ask" is if you're physically able;
"may ask" is permission.

13:30.925 --> 13:32.693
Toodle-oo, Sheriff.

13:36.931 --> 13:39.131
C-Carry on.

13:57.217 --> 14:01.488
I know it's hard but although
Mrs. Dodd has left this world

14:01.588 --> 14:04.892
and is teaching in another,
we're never going to forget her, right?

14:04.992 --> 14:08.529
And she's never going to forget
any one of you.

14:09.329 --> 14:15.302
I can feel her spirit in this classroom
right now, especially if I close my eyes.

14:16.502 --> 14:18.639
I see her.

14:18.739 --> 14:23.510
She's wearing that blue dress.
She looks so pretty.

14:23.610 --> 14:26.247
And she's smiling at all of you.
Do you see it?

14:26.347 --> 14:29.583
- Yeah.
- Do you see her pretty smile?

14:29.683 --> 14:31.285
Yeah.

14:31.785 --> 14:33.587
See, we're starting to remember her.

14:33.687 --> 14:37.024
If we do this every single day,
she'll always be with us.

14:37.124 --> 14:39.860
- Okay?
- Yeah.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.898
You're probably wondering
why I passed your cards back out?

14:43.998 --> 14:49.270
I was thinking that we should paste them,
each one to its own balloon,

14:49.370 --> 14:52.539
and then one day,
we're going to release them.

14:52.639 --> 14:54.172
Yeah.

14:54.942 --> 14:58.746
- You said she'd come back.
- I know, sweetheart.

15:00.346 --> 15:03.851
I was wrong. Sometimes Miss Meadows...

15:03.951 --> 15:06.053
Lie! You lied!

15:06.153 --> 15:10.257
Heather. Excuse me, children.
Why don't you get started?

15:10.357 --> 15:12.560
Heather, sweetheart.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.030
Heather, sweetheart. Heather.

15:16.130 --> 15:18.465
Come here, come here. Heather.

15:18.565 --> 15:21.802
It's okay, sweetie. I'm so sorry.

15:21.902 --> 15:23.872
I'm so sorry.

15:24.972 --> 15:29.610
All the bad people stay
and all the good ones die.

15:29.710 --> 15:34.214
I hate the world. It's a terrible place.

15:34.514 --> 15:38.819
I know.
Sometimes it is but not all the time.

15:38.919 --> 15:41.689
And it's our responsibility...

15:42.989 --> 15:44.927
to make it a better place.

15:50.898 --> 15:53.133
Hey, Miss Meadows,
do you want to come to Happy Hour?

15:53.233 --> 15:54.601
Hey, Katharine.

15:54.701 --> 15:57.004
I don't see how Happy Hour
will make much of a difference...

15:57.104 --> 16:01.275
- Bye, Miss Meadows. I like your outfit.
- Well, thank you. Have a good afternoon.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.982
- Toodle-oo.
- Miss Meadows.

16:05.312 --> 16:08.449
- May I?
- Sheriff.

16:08.549 --> 16:11.185
An absolutely splendid edition
that is essential to all.

16:11.285 --> 16:14.486
If this doesn't make you proper,
nothing will.

16:22.429 --> 16:23.995
Thank you.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.336
I've always wanted my own copy.

16:43.716 --> 16:46.220
A sentence contains
no unnecessary words,

16:46.320 --> 16:49.623
a paragraph no unnecessary sentences.

16:50.223 --> 16:52.159
Make every word tell.

16:53.559 --> 16:58.065
I would like to take you
for an afternoon spin

16:58.165 --> 17:02.534
in my 1970 classic
Chevrolet pickup truck.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.778
I would like that very much.

17:16.650 --> 17:19.353
How, may I ask,
do you know where I work?

17:21.053 --> 17:22.753
I ran your plate.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.626
Your work address came up. I...

17:31.164 --> 17:34.334
- That's illegal.
- Yes, it is. I feel really bad.

17:34.434 --> 17:37.938
I just... I couldn't stop thinking
about this girl

17:38.038 --> 17:40.927
in the middle of the road
holding a toad.

17:41.028 --> 17:46.011
Dead right, I'm sorry.
I apologize to you. I broke the rules.

17:51.752 --> 17:54.321
I think it's okay to break
the rules sometimes.

17:54.421 --> 17:55.653
Good.

17:57.057 --> 17:59.090
You tell your kids that?

18:02.296 --> 18:03.464
What?

18:03.564 --> 18:06.464
That it's okay to break
the rules sometimes?

18:10.137 --> 18:13.641
Well, I remind them of their goodness.

18:14.241 --> 18:16.274
How to...

18:18.145 --> 18:21.715
protect themselves if they're around someone
that they don't think is good.

18:21.815 --> 18:23.982
I like that.

18:26.019 --> 18:30.955
Listen, if kids aren't safe,
if they don't feel safe, we're all lost.

18:38.832 --> 18:42.369
- I like the rain.
- Why?

18:43.169 --> 18:45.469
Makes me feel clean.

18:48.575 --> 18:51.512
I bought this property a few years ago.

18:51.912 --> 18:56.548
And right here, this is where I figured
I would build a house one day.

18:58.419 --> 19:01.355
- Do you have a contractor's licence?
- No, I don't have a contractor's licence

19:01.455 --> 19:04.658
but I will hire someone
to help me, so thank you.

19:04.758 --> 19:07.058
Butterscotch or liquorice?

19:17.304 --> 19:22.777
Sheriff, what may I ask made you choose
law enforcement as your career?

19:23.577 --> 19:26.713
- Fear.
- Of what?

19:27.213 --> 19:30.373
It's a career choice motivated by
the soul-numbing fear that I might end up

19:30.474 --> 19:33.585
- like the rest of my family.
- What does that mean?

19:35.422 --> 19:39.124
Are you familiar with the term convicts?

19:42.829 --> 19:45.296
So you have bad blood.

19:47.100 --> 19:51.338
I don't know if I'd call it that.
Why did you start teaching?

19:51.438 --> 19:54.241
- I'm asking you the questions.
- Oh, really? Okay.

19:54.341 --> 19:56.610
So what's your second...

19:57.910 --> 19:59.884
career choice?

20:03.350 --> 20:06.853
- You have to promise not to laugh.
- No.

20:07.553 --> 20:09.053
No?

20:11.858 --> 20:14.326
- You want me to take a risk?
- Yes, please.

20:16.530 --> 20:18.565
Professional accordion player.

20:20.065 --> 20:21.199
Why?

20:23.637 --> 20:27.875
Why not?
I think it has this obscure beauty.

20:27.975 --> 20:30.011
It's misunderstood.

20:32.011 --> 20:38.217
Did you know that the accordion is the
second least-appreciated musical instrument

20:38.417 --> 20:42.822
right ahead of the bagpipe
and right behind the dead-kitten flute?

20:42.922 --> 20:46.191
No, I did not know that
until right this very moment.

21:03.377 --> 21:07.781
- What may I ask are you doing?
- I'm dancing to your accordion.

21:09.683 --> 21:11.653
I'm not that good.

21:12.253 --> 21:14.389
It's a work in progress.

21:15.889 --> 21:17.321
Isn't everything?

22:16.116 --> 22:20.687
Thank you for the...
the spin and the snack.

22:21.487 --> 22:23.687
You're very welcome.

22:29.996 --> 22:31.898
Miss Meadows.

22:31.998 --> 22:33.998
Yes?

22:36.070 --> 22:38.535
- May I...
- Yes.

23:11.872 --> 23:13.505
Right.

23:18.111 --> 23:20.247
That's gonna cover
that top window pane, right?

23:20.347 --> 23:22.015
- Yep.
- The top and the bottom.

23:22.115 --> 23:24.284
Mrs. Davenport, what are you doing?

23:24.384 --> 23:26.753
Oh, better safe than sorry.

23:26.853 --> 23:30.624
I'm sorry you don't feel safe. I thought
you said the neighbourhood had improved.

23:30.724 --> 23:33.059
Haven't you been reading the newspapers?

23:33.159 --> 23:36.830
The Department of Corrections
released nearly 2000 prisoners

23:36.930 --> 23:39.466
over the last six months
because of "overcrowding."

23:39.566 --> 23:42.342
Now they can only account
for 800 of them.

23:42.443 --> 23:46.773
Some say that they've moved
right into this very neighbourhood.

23:46.873 --> 23:48.775
My Doug says that it's unconstitutional

23:48.875 --> 23:51.311
to try and stop them.
He says it's the law.

23:51.411 --> 23:55.215
Well... you can't live in fear.

23:55.315 --> 23:58.985
Oh, Miss Meadows.
You're so young and naive.

23:59.085 --> 24:02.088
I dare say I'm neither.
I just appear that way.

24:02.188 --> 24:05.893
I hate to say this but I would not
walk around the neighbourhood

24:05.994 --> 24:10.263
in such lovely outfits.
You make yourself a target.

24:14.100 --> 24:18.305
Mrs. Davenport,
I don't change my style for anyone.

24:19.405 --> 24:20.905
Toodle-oo.

24:23.410 --> 24:26.980
Yes, Toodle-oo to you, too.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.516
Oh, dear.

24:29.616 --> 24:33.487
<i>Holy, holy, holy</i>

24:33.587 --> 24:37.656
<i>Lord God Almighty</i>

24:37.756 --> 24:41.927
<i>Early in the morning</i>

24:42.027 --> 24:47.398
<i>My soul shall rise to thee</i>

24:47.701 --> 24:52.205
<i>Holy, holy, holy</i>

24:52.305 --> 24:56.843
<i>Merciful and mighty</i>

24:56.943 --> 25:01.747
<i>God in three persons</i>

25:01.847 --> 25:06.750
<i>Blessed Trinity</i>

25:06.920 --> 25:10.857
So, I leave you, my friends,
with a question from Luke.

25:10.957 --> 25:13.727
Who are our neighbours?

25:13.827 --> 25:18.498
Let's then ask ourselves,
how can we serve them better?

25:18.598 --> 25:22.999
Isn't that the example
we want to give our children?

25:24.971 --> 25:28.906
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

25:35.147 --> 25:38.149
- Hello, Sheriff.
- Miss Meadows.

25:40.520 --> 25:45.425
Much as I was looking forward to seeing you,
I never imagined I'd see you here.

25:46.025 --> 25:49.093
- Are you Catholic?
- No.

25:50.530 --> 25:52.533
No, thank you.

25:54.033 --> 25:56.208
I like singing in choirs.

25:56.909 --> 25:58.302
You?

25:59.539 --> 26:04.578
Recovering. My grandmother
used to take me here when I was a kid.

26:04.678 --> 26:07.698
I used to get kicked out all the time.
And she sat me down

26:07.799 --> 26:11.451
and reminded me that she's the only one
in the family not going to hell.

26:11.551 --> 26:14.374
And that if I played my cards right,
she'd take me along with her

26:14.475 --> 26:18.357
which I think is quite morbid, actually.
Anyway,

26:19.158 --> 26:21.394
I promised her I'd just show up.

26:22.694 --> 26:24.728
You kept your promise.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.967
I don't make them if I can't keep them.

26:34.908 --> 26:37.241
I can still taste your kiss.

26:53.426 --> 26:55.626
Make a wish.

27:07.573 --> 27:10.777
- Is it okay?
- Yeah.

27:18.785 --> 27:20.449
Is that good?

27:27.560 --> 27:30.463
- Look at me.
- I'm sorry.

27:30.563 --> 27:33.133
- It feels good.
- Okay.

27:33.233 --> 27:33.893
Okay.

27:35.794 --> 27:38.302
- Look at me.
- Okay.

28:18.478 --> 28:23.347
Do you think repeat criminal offenders
can be rehabilitated?

28:26.852 --> 28:29.120
Is this your idea of pillow talk?

28:30.890 --> 28:33.057
Pillows don't talk.

28:34.626 --> 28:35.862
Just... just...

28:35.962 --> 28:38.930
- Sorry.
- Okay.

28:43.536 --> 28:46.736
Come here. Come here.

28:56.049 --> 28:58.033
So do you?

28:59.319 --> 29:01.354
Do I?

29:01.654 --> 29:04.656
I believe in second chances.

29:05.892 --> 29:11.362
I believe in trying but rehabilitation
didn't work for my father.

29:16.702 --> 29:18.738
So why do you do what you do?

29:18.838 --> 29:20.707
Okay, why don't we keep business
out of the bedroom?

29:20.807 --> 29:23.476
Because the law is everybody's business.

29:24.696 --> 29:27.547
Is it? Is it?

29:27.647 --> 29:29.482
Is the law everybody's responsibility?

29:29.582 --> 29:32.052
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

29:32.152 --> 29:37.524
Look at this vigilante case I'm working on.
Part of me admires the guy.

29:38.224 --> 29:42.526
But you're never gonna get me to say it
out loud because it's not politically correct.

29:53.940 --> 29:57.610
You know, "politically correct"
is for politicians.

29:57.710 --> 30:00.513
And there are bad people in the world.

30:00.613 --> 30:03.614
And they shouldn't be around
the good people.

30:05.951 --> 30:08.985
Especially the little ones.

30:19.699 --> 30:21.799
You're amazing.

30:25.838 --> 30:30.841
You look amazing. You are amazing.
That was amazing.

30:34.881 --> 30:36.204
Can I ask a question, Miss Meadows?

30:36.305 --> 30:38.282
- Sure.
- Was that amazing for you?

30:41.788 --> 30:43.256
Sheriff,

30:44.256 --> 30:49.294
there are certain things
that a lady doesn't... tell a gentleman.

30:56.836 --> 31:00.738
You do have manners.
Don't you, Miss Meadows?

31:09.715 --> 31:12.416
What would the world be without them?

31:16.589 --> 31:21.124
We'll never forget you, Mrs. Dodd!

31:22.328 --> 31:26.698
She's an angel up there now. Isn't she?

31:28.701 --> 31:30.937
Yes, she certainly is.

31:31.037 --> 31:33.907
Would you be our teacher for the rest
of the year, Miss Meadows?

31:34.007 --> 31:37.410
- Oh, no, I'm just your substitute.
- Why don't you stay?

31:37.510 --> 31:40.013
Can we have our snack now?

31:40.113 --> 31:41.714
Yes.

31:41.814 --> 31:45.251
I think that we all have earned a treat.
I'm gonna go get us some hot dogs.

31:45.351 --> 31:48.955
You guys stay with Miss Katherine.
Play nicely. I expect good manners.

31:54.227 --> 31:57.297
Hi, I'd like to order
16 Top Dogs, please.

32:04.704 --> 32:06.272
Hello.

32:17.383 --> 32:19.717
I want to die.

32:21.954 --> 32:24.624
- I think you should.
- What?

32:24.824 --> 32:28.394
You're of no use to society.
You'll waste innocent taxpayers' dollars,

32:28.494 --> 32:31.965
abuse the weak legal system
and enter a cowardly plea of insanity

32:32.065 --> 32:35.468
to a morally bankrupt
defence attorney. For what?

32:35.768 --> 32:40.440
Oh, and once incarcerated, you're gonna cost
taxpayers approximately $47,000 per year.

32:40.540 --> 32:45.979
So you know what? Make sure you point the
barrel of the gun to the back of the throat.

32:46.779 --> 32:49.615
- I think I've changed my mind.
- That is so not an option.

33:40.467 --> 33:44.504
- Never fear, Miss Meadows is here.
- Where's our hot dogs?

33:45.204 --> 33:50.776
Oh, well, Top Dog is experiencing
some unforeseen problems

33:50.876 --> 33:54.213
and when it does, it's important
to have another plan to fall back on.

33:54.313 --> 33:59.518
You know, when one path is blocked,
we simply walk down another path. Right?

33:59.619 --> 34:02.488
- Yes.
- And that's what hope is.

34:02.588 --> 34:06.059
Hope is usually...

34:06.159 --> 34:11.031
right around the corner. Just like that
ice cream truck. Ice cream for everyone!

34:11.130 --> 34:13.099
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

34:13.199 --> 34:15.234
What kind of flavour are you gonna get?

34:15.333 --> 34:19.237
Same kind as you, Miss Meadows.

34:19.338 --> 34:23.076
Miss Meadows, when I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

34:23.176 --> 34:26.946
- Please don't say that, sweetheart.
- Why not?

34:27.045 --> 34:30.583
Well, because you should aspire
to be your own individual.

34:30.683 --> 34:34.687
You know, grow up
and have your own unique traits.

34:34.786 --> 34:37.388
And secret ways, too?

34:40.859 --> 34:43.728
- Pardon me?
- I can keep a secret, Miss Meadows.

34:43.829 --> 34:47.299
But children shouldn't have secrets.
And they shouldn't keep them.

34:47.599 --> 34:51.501
But you spilled something on your dress.

34:53.338 --> 34:54.306
What?

34:54.407 --> 34:57.141
But you spilled something
on your dress, Miss Meadows.

35:00.479 --> 35:02.548
I guess I did.

35:02.648 --> 35:06.252
I dislike that very much.
How about we get some ice cream?

35:08.053 --> 35:10.423
Miss Meadows needs
some ice cream right now.

35:10.523 --> 35:12.558
- Yay!
- Yeah, let's do it.

35:12.658 --> 35:15.061
- What's his name?
- Frank.

35:15.161 --> 35:17.163
- Hi, Frankie.
- I said his name is Frank.

35:17.263 --> 35:20.398
Children, we mustn't approach animals
that we don't know. Come on.

35:20.499 --> 35:23.770
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Always let them come to you.

35:24.570 --> 35:26.970
Always let them come to you.

35:42.755 --> 35:44.090
- Mike.
- Yo.

35:44.190 --> 35:46.292
- Heads up.
- What?

35:47.022 --> 35:48.527
Nice catch.

35:48.627 --> 35:52.465
Hey listen, we've been compiling the case
information from the other jurisdictions

35:52.565 --> 35:55.034
and we've got a composite
on the vigilante.

35:55.134 --> 35:58.704
And it looks like some kind of a...

35:58.804 --> 36:01.173
Pulp Fiction Mary Poppins.

36:01.373 --> 36:04.677
Now, personally I'm not buying
that a woman is pulling all this off.

36:04.777 --> 36:08.029
I mean, not that they're not capable of it.
Clearly Michelle is batshit

36:08.130 --> 36:09.715
before her period comes.

36:09.815 --> 36:11.882
- Danny, thank you.
- You got it.

36:15.388 --> 36:17.554
And can I get the ball back?

36:19.358 --> 36:21.225
Thought I taught you better than that.

37:03.502 --> 37:06.572
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

37:06.672 --> 37:07.873
Miss Meadows.

37:09.573 --> 37:11.374
How you doing?

37:13.145 --> 37:15.045
You look beautiful.

37:15.848 --> 37:18.048
I got you something.

37:22.488 --> 37:26.192
Wow. I love yellow.

37:26.292 --> 37:28.794
I hope so. I stole it
from your front yard.

37:34.266 --> 37:36.736
So I thought maybe we could talk?

37:36.836 --> 37:40.773
- Yeah, it's a lovely day.
- It is a lovely day.

37:40.873 --> 37:43.073
And this is a lovely door.

37:58.892 --> 38:01.560
You always wear those on your shoes?

38:01.660 --> 38:03.593
Yeah.

38:06.899 --> 38:09.235
Oh, this needs some work.

38:09.335 --> 38:11.937
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. You?

38:12.037 --> 38:16.640
Good, yes. I'm fine. I'm just asking...
There was a shooting near the school today.

38:17.576 --> 38:21.981
And civilians were massacred.
The alleged shooter was killed also.

38:22.881 --> 38:27.588
- Excellent.
- Excellent? That's a good thing?

38:29.288 --> 38:30.487
Yeah.

38:32.524 --> 38:35.461
Wait, I'm... I'm confused, Sheriff.

38:35.561 --> 38:39.095
You just said that civilians
were killed.

38:40.099 --> 38:43.568
What's the concern
over how the shooter died?

38:43.668 --> 38:45.871
Oh, no. My concern is about you.

38:45.971 --> 38:48.808
There was an ice cream vendor
who said there was

38:48.908 --> 38:52.978
children from your school there
right around the time of the shooting.

39:04.523 --> 39:06.960
- Vanilla chocolate chip.
- Excuse me?

39:07.060 --> 39:09.947
That's my favourite flavour
and they said that they will have it

39:10.048 --> 39:12.529
restocked by tomorrow.

39:15.768 --> 39:18.970
- What's your favourite?
- Vanilla chocolate chip.

39:25.611 --> 39:27.680
Then maybe we could
go together sometime.

39:27.780 --> 39:32.036
- I'd like that. Do you like cones?
- Yeah.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.640
Good. I like the cones.
I feel a little goofy

39:34.741 --> 39:38.557
when I'm walking down the street
holding one but the uniform helps.

39:40.125 --> 39:42.594
Where did you live
before you moved here?

39:43.638 --> 39:46.733
- Somewhere else.
- Like Dayton?

39:47.333 --> 39:50.769
No. I didn't like Dayton.

39:50.869 --> 39:52.435
So you did live there.

39:54.105 --> 39:55.840
Why do you want to know?

39:55.940 --> 40:00.428
Well, there was just other vigilante-style
killings there and I thought maybe

40:00.529 --> 40:03.814
- you'd heard of them.
- Nope.

40:07.286 --> 40:08.653
No.

40:13.492 --> 40:16.092
I moved here five and a half months ago.

40:22.635 --> 40:25.372
Is there something
you're not telling me?

40:27.872 --> 40:31.074
There are a lot of things
I'm not telling you, Sheriff.

40:32.678 --> 40:37.516
<i>Elements of Style's</i> 17th instruction
recommends to omit...

40:38.416 --> 40:40.616
needless words.

40:42.621 --> 40:43.821
Okay.

40:59.471 --> 41:02.251
Sheriff, can you do me
a favour please? I want to know

41:02.352 --> 41:05.943
if any of the newly released convicts
have moved into this neighbourhood.

41:08.580 --> 41:12.018
- Why?
- For the school, for the kids.

41:12.618 --> 41:16.286
And I've seen someone
lurking about and he makes me...

41:18.890 --> 41:21.521
- uncomfortable.
- Okay, who?

41:21.622 --> 41:24.797
- Someone said anything to you?
- No.

41:24.897 --> 41:27.931
- Nothing's happened?
- No.

41:31.503 --> 41:33.270
I'll look into it.

41:36.309 --> 41:39.645
I should go back to...

41:40.245 --> 41:42.212
work, so...

41:48.486 --> 41:51.655
You're killing me.
I can't sleep at night.

41:52.925 --> 41:54.891
Toodle-oo.

42:05.737 --> 42:09.542
You're a vital young woman. Don't worry.

42:09.642 --> 42:12.212
A mother never stops her worry.

42:13.412 --> 42:15.681
- Is it fair?
- What's that, Miss Meadows?

42:15.781 --> 42:19.149
To bring a child into this world?

42:22.287 --> 42:26.222
I tell all my patients, if you make
your home a loving, stable environment,

42:26.323 --> 42:28.743
that's all a child needs to thrive.

42:29.126 --> 42:31.761
- How big is it?
- About the size of your thumbnail.

42:39.271 --> 42:41.173
Wow.

42:48.347 --> 42:50.113
Wait.

42:55.020 --> 42:56.889
Toodle-oo.

43:01.189 --> 43:02.817
Frank, shut up.

43:09.668 --> 43:12.071
Frank, I said shut up!

43:15.040 --> 43:17.074
Sit down!

43:18.610 --> 43:21.780
That's him.
I've seen him walking with his dog.

43:21.880 --> 43:25.051
He was convicted of felony child abuse.

43:34.393 --> 43:37.762
That's a nice purse you have,
by the way.

43:37.862 --> 43:39.417
Thank you.

43:40.097 --> 43:44.503
My mother says a lady never leaves home
without her accessories. I agree with her.

43:44.603 --> 43:48.641
You don't talk about your mother much.
What's she like?

43:49.241 --> 43:52.611
Peanut brittle. Maybe artichokes.

43:52.711 --> 43:56.148
In that rare exception, a clean
public restroom, which I agree with.

43:56.248 --> 43:57.250
- Miss Meadows?
- Yes.

43:57.350 --> 43:58.751
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

43:58.851 --> 44:01.186
What do you do when you're not working?

44:01.286 --> 44:06.325
My hobbies. You know, my gardening.
Takes a lot of time.

44:06.425 --> 44:12.297
And knitting, and sometimes I paint.
And then there's my volunteer work.

44:12.397 --> 44:15.501
Can you be a little more
vague, maybe? Today.

44:15.601 --> 44:18.534
What did you do
when you got off work today?

44:24.272 --> 44:26.242
Sheriff...

44:30.181 --> 44:35.585
I went to the fabric store, and I
got some yarn and knitting needles.

44:38.857 --> 44:41.057
And I started making a blanket.

44:45.264 --> 44:49.566
A baby blanket... for our baby.

45:00.512 --> 45:03.016
Why didn't you tell me?

45:04.716 --> 45:05.749
I just did.

45:09.621 --> 45:12.258
Do you know what this means?

45:14.058 --> 45:18.161
Yeah. I don't... I don't know.

45:19.198 --> 45:20.998
Look at me.

45:24.503 --> 45:26.570
Miss Meadows...

45:30.108 --> 45:31.744
I want you to marry me.

45:32.844 --> 45:34.280
Me?

45:35.080 --> 45:36.446
Yes, you.

45:39.618 --> 45:43.186
- You don't know me.
- I know everything I need to know.

45:46.124 --> 45:47.892
I'll take care of you.

45:48.392 --> 45:53.029
It would be the highest honour
of my life to protect you and this child.

45:58.237 --> 46:00.170
Really?

46:04.509 --> 46:06.042
Please.

46:11.816 --> 46:12.916
Yes.

46:14.152 --> 46:15.852
Yes!

46:54.927 --> 46:56.530
Sheriff...

46:58.630 --> 47:00.701
Miss Meadows?

47:03.101 --> 47:07.272
You know marriage has a certain...
ring to it.

47:07.372 --> 47:10.843
You know, a wedding ring,
engagement ring...

47:10.943 --> 47:12.410
suffer-ring.

47:12.510 --> 47:14.780
Oh, you have a very strange
sense of humour.

47:14.880 --> 47:18.217
- You think I have a sense of humour?
- I do think you have a sense of humour...

47:18.317 --> 47:20.951
- You think I'm funny?
- I think you're strangely funny.

47:39.304 --> 47:41.338
Mother?

47:44.109 --> 47:46.179
I met someone.

47:47.579 --> 47:52.581
And he has... kind eyes.

47:53.218 --> 47:57.723
- Just like Grandpa did, remember?
<i>- What are little boys made of?</i>

47:58.123 --> 48:00.792
Frogs and snails and puppy dog tails.

48:01.392 --> 48:05.897
Well, he's not a boy.
He says he's a man.

48:06.297 --> 48:10.569
- That's what they all say.
- Was I a good baby, Mother?

48:11.769 --> 48:14.439
Mary... you were a perfect baby.

48:14.839 --> 48:16.544
Mother...

48:18.844 --> 48:21.714
When did I become...

48:22.514 --> 48:25.884
- less perfect?
- You were always perfect to me.

48:25.984 --> 48:28.220
When did I start to realize
that the world was...

48:28.320 --> 48:30.522
A rotting cesspool
of decay and mediocrity?

48:30.622 --> 48:34.559
I'd have to say that was when that awful
Mr. Redding tried to bomb the mall.

48:34.659 --> 48:37.963
- I thought it was when Uncle Clybert...
- Oh, no. It was years later, honey.

48:38.063 --> 48:42.868
And it was before I found Mrs. Hartford
hanging from the theatre rafters.

48:42.968 --> 48:47.637
Oh, I still think that was a shame.
She has such a beautiful singing voice.

48:52.377 --> 48:54.113
Or maybe it was...

48:54.513 --> 48:56.713
<i>Of course it was, dear.</i>

48:59.818 --> 49:04.656
<i>The wheels on the bus
go round and round</i>

49:04.756 --> 49:08.961
<i>Round and round
Round and round</i>

49:09.061 --> 49:12.729
<i>The wheels on the bus
go round and round</i>

49:15.133 --> 49:19.635
All... through... the town...

49:21.239 --> 49:24.974
The wipers on the bus go swish,
swish, swish...

49:26.211 --> 49:30.449
Swish, swish, swish...
swish, swish, swish...

49:30.549 --> 49:35.652
The wipers on the bus go swish,
swish, swish...

49:37.489 --> 49:40.990
All... through... the town...

49:53.005 --> 49:55.843
- I did it.
- Of course you did.

49:55.944 --> 49:59.378
- You can do anything.
- I can?

50:00.668 --> 50:03.149
Hey, come here.

50:07.953 --> 50:10.889
<i>Mary? Mary?</i>

50:10.989 --> 50:13.189
<i>Are you still there?</i>

50:17.963 --> 50:20.232
Mother, I have to go.

50:20.832 --> 50:23.902
- Where are you off to now, my love?
- I'm going to have tea with a neighbour.

50:24.002 --> 50:26.238
Oh, very good, dear.
Remember, mind your manners.

50:26.838 --> 50:31.576
Our time we must not idly waste,
since all our hours fly off in haste.

50:31.676 --> 50:36.913
With each new minute I strive
to fill my seven new acts of duty still.

50:39.651 --> 50:43.719
- Toodle-oo, I love you.
- Toodle-oo, I love you too.

51:10.014 --> 51:10.915
You.

51:11.915 --> 51:14.453
- Hello.
- Hello.

51:15.253 --> 51:18.354
I brought some tea and crumpets.

51:19.491 --> 51:23.095
Really? That's nice.

51:23.195 --> 51:25.764
You have no idea
how much that means, Miss?

51:25.864 --> 51:28.832
- Meadows.
- Won't you come in, Miss Meadows.

51:39.978 --> 51:41.778
Please.

51:46.318 --> 51:49.121
You'll have to, excuse the house.

51:49.221 --> 51:51.990
I'm still settling in.

51:52.290 --> 51:57.229
- Did you just move to town?
- Yes, just like you, right?

51:57.529 --> 51:59.832
No, I've lived here for months.

52:00.832 --> 52:02.399
Me too.

52:05.870 --> 52:11.875
This is so thoughtful. To be honest,
I haven't made a lot of friends yet.

52:35.300 --> 52:38.103
First of all, I wanted to say...

52:38.903 --> 52:41.775
that I try to approach...

52:43.875 --> 52:46.378
every situation...

52:47.078 --> 52:51.081
- hoping for the best.
- What a lovely way to think.

52:52.817 --> 52:57.390
And I certainly do hope
that you respect the...

52:58.490 --> 53:02.994
peaceful and safe ways that
this community works so hard at,

53:03.094 --> 53:05.530
and they've come to cherish it.

53:05.630 --> 53:07.666
I'm looking forward to it.

53:07.766 --> 53:11.069
And I also want you to know that I know
exactly who and what you are,

53:11.169 --> 53:16.038
and should you harm anyone,
or any child, you will be killed.

53:16.741 --> 53:19.075
What did you just say?

53:22.614 --> 53:24.480
I said you will be killed.

53:25.817 --> 53:27.984
And just... who's going to kill me?

53:32.857 --> 53:35.092
- I am.
- You?

53:38.730 --> 53:44.400
Miss Meadows, have no fear.
Your message was received loud and clear.

53:46.544 --> 53:47.879
Good.

53:52.778 --> 53:54.378
Good.

53:54.879 --> 53:57.516
That was my intention.

53:57.716 --> 54:01.953
I have to say...
we're two peas in a pod,

54:02.053 --> 54:05.621
- and we have a lot in common.
- We have nothing in common.

54:11.796 --> 54:16.302
- Actually...
- So now that you've come to visit me,

54:17.402 --> 54:20.636
I think I should pay you
a visit at the school sometime.

54:25.342 --> 54:29.649
That is not a good idea.
It won't end well for you.

54:30.149 --> 54:35.068
- Gosh, that sounds like a threat.
- I do not make threats.

54:36.169 --> 54:40.123
I make promises.
And only promises that I intend to keep.

54:44.529 --> 54:48.166
Where are my manners?
Here you are in my house,

54:48.266 --> 54:52.003
and I've not even properly introduced
myself. My name is Skylar.

54:52.303 --> 54:54.937
I don't care to know your name.

54:58.410 --> 55:01.010
Well, now, who's forgotten
their manners?

55:05.249 --> 55:09.836
What gives you the right to come into
my house, threatening, making accusations,

55:09.937 --> 55:13.455
when I haven't done anything wrong?

55:13.892 --> 55:17.392
That's illegal, Miss Meadows.

55:20.465 --> 55:23.135
The truth is not illegal.

55:24.035 --> 55:25.504
Hey.

55:26.404 --> 55:30.038
You have no idea what it's like
to have to start over again.

55:34.478 --> 55:37.580
- I most certainly do.
- Are you forgetting something?

55:39.651 --> 55:42.821
My therapist says I have to take care
of myself and my needs

55:42.921 --> 55:47.025
before I can be good for anyone else.
Do you have one?

55:47.925 --> 55:51.229
Because... and please
don't take this personally...

55:51.329 --> 55:55.633
I think you could really use one. And I would
be happy to make a recommendation,

55:55.933 --> 55:59.501
because... you shouldn't wait.

56:00.304 --> 56:02.205
Toodle-oo.

56:21.860 --> 56:24.060
Hey, you.

57:24.722 --> 57:28.260
Even though this is Sunday, what we discuss
in here applies to every day, Louie.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.028
- Miss Meadows?
- Yes?

57:30.128 --> 57:32.764
How come Jesus looks like
a fashion model in that picture,

57:32.864 --> 57:35.600
but, like, any better
in my Aunt Bea's bedroom.

57:35.900 --> 57:38.570
Well, since Jesus was a Jew
and came from Israel,

57:38.670 --> 57:41.473
my guess is that he looked like
neither one of those paintings.

57:41.573 --> 57:44.008
Those paintings
were most probably done by...

57:44.108 --> 57:46.511
an idealistic painter.

57:53.051 --> 57:54.920
- Oh, look at him!
- He's so cute!

57:55.020 --> 57:57.889
He looks like he's about two years old.

57:58.989 --> 58:01.537
That's 16 in a dog life.

58:01.826 --> 58:03.793
Too old for this class.

58:19.343 --> 58:25.214
We were discussing how every day is Sunday,
in terms of how we live, right?

58:30.588 --> 58:34.126
Hey, William,
what are you drawing a picture of?

58:34.626 --> 58:36.891
I don't know.

58:39.664 --> 58:43.034
- You don't want to join the other kids?
- I don't know.

58:43.134 --> 58:45.534
Are you feeling okay?

58:47.905 --> 58:51.910
Why does Jesus say to turn
the other cheek when someone hits you?

58:52.310 --> 58:55.413
Because he's saying that
that's preferable to fighting.

58:55.513 --> 59:00.616
But what if you do turn it,
and then he, like, punches that one too?

59:19.203 --> 59:23.706
Miss Meadows has an idea.
How about an early cookie break?

59:26.237 --> 59:28.046
Special one for you.

59:28.146 --> 59:32.727
Amber? I think it's your turn.
You're doing a very nice job.

59:32.828 --> 59:37.256
You're so quiet.
One cookie each, all right? Ooh.

59:38.156 --> 59:39.889
Beautiful.

59:42.360 --> 59:45.129
You know you can
tell me anything, right?

59:45.229 --> 59:47.421
Are you sure you ran into that wall?

59:48.332 --> 59:51.569
- I have to prepare at church for mass.
- What are you talking about? It's over.

59:51.669 --> 59:53.271
Papa Peter says I have to be there.

59:53.371 --> 59:56.671
He doesn't like it if I'm late.
He says it's a sin!

01:00:03.481 --> 01:00:06.619
Stop it! Stop!

01:00:10.121 --> 01:00:14.225
- Father!
- The lord ask that we not judge.

01:00:14.325 --> 01:00:17.095
I think he asks more of us than that.

01:00:17.195 --> 01:00:20.098
How dare you? How dare you?

01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:23.334
- I do God's work!
- Don't you touch him!

01:01:59.897 --> 01:02:01.566
- Get out of my bed.
- Boo!

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:08.270
Is that a toy gun?

01:02:16.447 --> 01:02:18.216
Guns are not toys, sweetie.

01:02:18.316 --> 01:02:22.120
That was a... secret toy?

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.223
Heather, I'm so sorry.

01:02:25.823 --> 01:02:27.525
I hope I didn't frighten you.

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:32.194
Never fear... Miss Meadows is here.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.870
- How did you get here?
- I walked.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:44.675
It was only a couple of blocks.
I wanted to surprise you.

01:02:44.875 --> 01:02:46.911
And how did you get in my bed?

01:02:47.011 --> 01:02:50.114
It was easy.
I just crawled through the window.

01:02:50.214 --> 01:02:53.982
You don't have ugly bars
like everyone else.

01:03:01.425 --> 01:03:02.958
Miss Meadows?

01:03:06.231 --> 01:03:08.033
Can I...

01:03:08.733 --> 01:03:11.833
May I... be your flower girl?

01:03:13.537 --> 01:03:16.974
- Flower girl?
- Please? Oh, please!

01:03:17.074 --> 01:03:18.674
Okay, okay.

01:03:24.014 --> 01:03:26.625
I want you to be happy.
If you want to be my flower girl,

01:03:26.726 --> 01:03:30.154
- you can be my flower girl.
- It'll be so much fun!

01:03:30.254 --> 01:03:32.490
We'll be like best friends.

01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:37.191
I could tell you my secrets,
because I already know yours.

01:03:40.064 --> 01:03:41.366
Secrets?

01:03:41.966 --> 01:03:46.003
- Miss Meadows has a secret.
- What are you talking about?

01:03:46.103 --> 01:03:48.272
If I told you, it wouldn't be
a secret anymore.

01:03:48.372 --> 01:03:51.609
You have to tell me.
It'll be a secret between you and me.

01:03:51.709 --> 01:03:54.512
If I tell you,
can I still be your flower girl?

01:03:54.612 --> 01:03:56.180
Yes!

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.117
Only if you tell me.

01:04:00.217 --> 01:04:02.352
I saw you kill that man.

01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:06.491
What?

01:04:07.091 --> 01:04:09.660
- What man?
- In the Top Dog.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.664
I forgot to tell you
I wanted relish on my hotdog,

01:04:13.764 --> 01:04:17.032
and I went to the window, and I saw.

01:04:38.989 --> 01:04:41.859
You're just a little girl.
You're just a little girl.

01:04:41.959 --> 01:04:46.364
You're just a little girl. You're just
a little girl. You're just a little girl.

01:04:46.464 --> 01:04:50.368
You're just a little girl. I'm so sorry.

01:04:50.468 --> 01:04:53.871
I'm so, so, so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:58.607
I'm so sorry. I'm very, very sorry.

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:01.844
I'm so sorry.

01:05:07.618 --> 01:05:10.254
I still saw. It's okay.

01:05:10.654 --> 01:05:13.689
I have to go home now, for dinner.

01:05:20.631 --> 01:05:23.567
Why do you lock that one twice,
Miss Meadows?

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:30.775
Sometimes Miss Meadows
can be so... silly.

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:33.208
It's not silly to be scared,
Miss Meadows.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.218
I'm not scared of anything.

01:05:40.718 --> 01:05:43.120
Can I wear gloves like you do?

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.287
Yes. Come on.

01:05:57.068 --> 01:05:59.070
<i>- Hello, Mary.</i>
- Hey, Mommy.

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.404
<i>I had a feeling you might call.</i>

01:06:04.042 --> 01:06:08.212
Mom... Mom, I'm scared.

01:06:08.612 --> 01:06:10.882
I think I might...

01:06:10.982 --> 01:06:12.916
I might call the police.

01:06:13.016 --> 01:06:14.852
<i>- The police?</i>
- Yeah.

01:06:14.952 --> 01:06:18.222
Mary, how many times must I tell you?

01:06:18.322 --> 01:06:21.525
<i>We must never rely on others
to do what we know must be done.</i>

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:25.096
<i>We have to take it upon ourselves
to right the wrongs of this world.</i>

01:06:25.196 --> 01:06:28.766
If a woman's tongue is her sword,
just think what her body can do.

01:06:28.866 --> 01:06:30.739
But...

01:06:31.936 --> 01:06:36.163
our bodies can bring new life, right?
I mean, that too, right?

01:06:36.264 --> 01:06:38.476
- Right?
<i>- Sometimes.</i>

01:06:39.176 --> 01:06:40.845
It can also take it away.

01:06:40.945 --> 01:06:44.715
- Isn't that up to God?
- Oh, Mary, here you go again.

01:06:44.815 --> 01:06:47.051
<i>We don't want to rely
on the overburdened heavens</i>

01:06:47.151 --> 01:06:50.185
<i>to give everyone their retribution,
now, do we?</i>

01:06:52.089 --> 01:06:53.593
Mom...

01:06:55.493 --> 01:06:57.860
Mom, I almost...

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.336
I'm gonna have a...

01:07:05.636 --> 01:07:08.436
I'm gonna have a baby.

01:07:10.608 --> 01:07:15.010
Me. I'm gonna... I'm gonna have a baby.

01:07:18.282 --> 01:07:20.315
I'm gonna have a...

01:07:25.022 --> 01:07:27.723
I'm gonna have a wedding!

01:07:44.842 --> 01:07:47.111
Are we supposed to forgive everyone?

01:07:47.211 --> 01:07:48.212
Mommy...

01:07:48.312 --> 01:07:53.284
<i>Not everyone, my love.
Some things are unforgivable.</i>

01:07:58.989 --> 01:08:02.093
Today, we bid our dear
Mother Meadows goodbye.

01:08:02.193 --> 01:08:06.897
Lost to another act of senseless,
random violence.

01:08:06.997 --> 01:08:09.934
She leaves behind her pride and joy.

01:08:10.234 --> 01:08:15.439
Little Mary. Let us all pray
for good to triumph over evil,

01:08:15.539 --> 01:08:20.408
and let us pray that some thing
or someone will guide us on.

01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:25.448
So am I... Am I always
gonna be the black sheep?

01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:29.720
- <i>Yes, dear.</i>
- Okay. But I don't want to be.

01:08:29.819 --> 01:08:33.823
<i>Oh, now, now... there, there...</i>

01:08:33.924 --> 01:08:37.595
<i>Just remember...
black sheep are still lambs.</i>

01:08:37.694 --> 01:08:40.694
Mommy? Mother?

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.899
I miss you.

01:08:48.706 --> 01:08:51.339
But I'm gonna let you go now.

01:08:53.844 --> 01:08:56.411
I'm gonna let you go now.

01:09:02.051 --> 01:09:04.886
I'm gonna let you go now.

01:09:19.603 --> 01:09:21.337
- Hey, Mike?
- Yeah.

01:09:21.438 --> 01:09:22.973
- Got your ballistics report.
- Great.

01:09:23.073 --> 01:09:25.209
- Looks like we got a match.
- Right on.

01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:28.145
The truck driver and the Top Dog kid,
and now the priest,

01:09:28.245 --> 01:09:32.183
all with a .25 calibre
short-barrelled pistol. Same gun.

01:09:32.483 --> 01:09:34.950
- Okay.
- Oh, and there's this.

01:09:40.491 --> 01:09:44.694
It appears Father Peter
was a serial child molester.

01:09:44.795 --> 01:09:48.432
And now a bunch of kids are coming forward
claiming sexual abuse.

01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:52.238
Nobody misses a pervert.
If you ask me, this guy's lucky he's dead.

01:09:54.338 --> 01:09:58.475
Anyway. Oh, hey, we got
the wedding invitations too.

01:09:58.575 --> 01:10:02.179
- That didn't take long, did it?
- I guess when you know, you know.

01:10:02.279 --> 01:10:04.481
- Danny.
- Yeah.

01:10:04.581 --> 01:10:07.484
Was there anything about Michelle
that would've been a deal breaker?

01:10:08.184 --> 01:10:12.988
Maybe if she was a Steelers fan.
That probably would've done it.

01:10:27.604 --> 01:10:30.741
The baby has grown
since I started making this.

01:10:30.841 --> 01:10:35.179
I had to let out the seam. Can you tell?

01:10:35.279 --> 01:10:37.479
I think you look beautiful.

01:10:40.017 --> 01:10:41.717
Thanks.

01:10:45.155 --> 01:10:47.693
Is your mother coming to the wedding?

01:10:49.393 --> 01:10:52.096
My mother doesn't like weddings.

01:10:52.196 --> 01:10:55.633
You don't think she'll make
an exception this time?

01:10:55.733 --> 01:10:57.067
No.

01:10:57.167 --> 01:11:00.435
What mother doesn't want to see
her daughter walk down the aisle?

01:11:02.172 --> 01:11:03.739
Mine.

01:11:08.912 --> 01:11:11.048
What happened to your shoe?

01:11:11.548 --> 01:11:14.783
Oh, it lost a tap.

01:11:20.758 --> 01:11:22.791
I found this one.

01:11:26.897 --> 01:11:31.432
Oh! I've been looking all over for this.
Where did you find it?

01:11:33.404 --> 01:11:36.038
It was at the church.

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:50.021
I am gonna just put that on right now.

01:11:50.621 --> 01:11:52.488
Thank you.

01:12:12.109 --> 01:12:14.609
Dammit, it's not fitting.

01:12:16.447 --> 01:12:20.384
Yeah. That's right.

01:12:20.784 --> 01:12:23.184
Because it's not real.

01:12:27.224 --> 01:12:29.793
What are you talking about?

01:12:29.893 --> 01:12:32.127
It's not real.

01:12:34.465 --> 01:12:36.698
None of it is.

01:12:39.403 --> 01:12:41.972
Let's stop pretending, okay?

01:12:42.072 --> 01:12:47.208
Okay, now, let's stop pretending,
and let's tell the truth, you and I.

01:12:48.445 --> 01:12:50.949
Because I know.

01:12:51.749 --> 01:12:53.451
I know.

01:12:54.951 --> 01:12:57.376
I've been covering.
I've been denying the obvious,

01:12:57.477 --> 01:13:01.244
because I would do
anything for you. Anything.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:03.960
So I need you to do something for me.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:08.564
I need you to promise me
you're going to stop this. Okay?

01:13:14.137 --> 01:13:16.474
I can't promise you that.

01:13:17.074 --> 01:13:20.442
- Do you want cream or sugar?
- What happened to you?

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.340
You can tell me. You can tell me anything.
If you don't want to tell me,

01:13:26.441 --> 01:13:30.888
that's fine too. I'm here.
But I don't know what made you this way.

01:13:31.188 --> 01:13:34.124
And I just need you
to stop all this insanity.

01:13:34.224 --> 01:13:37.027
It's not insane!
What I do is not insane.

01:13:37.127 --> 01:13:41.398
You gotta be kidding me. You're walking
around with a gun in your purse.

01:13:41.498 --> 01:13:43.534
I don't know what
you're talking about anymore.

01:13:43.634 --> 01:13:45.302
I don't understand
anything you're saying.

01:13:45.402 --> 01:13:47.969
You can't talk to me
like a normal human being.

01:13:52.376 --> 01:13:55.112
You think I want to do this?
No one else is doing it!

01:13:55.212 --> 01:13:57.212
I see that. I'm aware of that.

01:14:02.085 --> 01:14:05.122
I mean, it's like the wolf
says to the lion...

01:14:05.222 --> 01:14:09.293
Okay, no. No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
You can't talk to me like this anymore.

01:14:09.393 --> 01:14:11.626
Just talk to me like a normal person.

01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:18.102
- I'm trying, okay?
- If you keep doing this...

01:14:18.702 --> 01:14:22.172
we're gonna get married
in federal prison.

01:14:22.272 --> 01:14:24.972
I don't want to, but I'll do it.

01:14:26.176 --> 01:14:27.978
I'll come visit you.

01:14:28.778 --> 01:14:31.081
But if you stop...

01:14:31.181 --> 01:14:34.749
If you can stop, I can bury this.

01:14:36.253 --> 01:14:41.292
Okay? But I need you to say that you
promise me you will never do this again.

01:14:41.392 --> 01:14:45.093
I need to know
that you're here with me also.

01:14:46.763 --> 01:14:49.066
Can you promise me?

01:14:49.566 --> 01:14:51.702
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:14:51.802 --> 01:14:52.903
- Yeah.
- You can?

01:14:53.003 --> 01:14:54.271
- I promise you.
- Okay.

01:14:54.371 --> 01:14:58.540
- Okay, good. Good, good, good.
- I'll...

01:15:01.478 --> 01:15:03.911
- Sheriff?
- Yes.

01:15:06.984 --> 01:15:08.753
I'll try.

01:15:10.153 --> 01:15:12.387
I will try.

01:15:20.063 --> 01:15:21.901
Here you go.

01:15:24.401 --> 01:15:27.304
She's got quite a...

01:15:27.604 --> 01:15:29.306
following.

01:15:29.606 --> 01:15:33.043
Oh, Miss Meadows, you look so pretty.

01:15:33.143 --> 01:15:37.180
Thank you. You look beautiful.

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.948
Can I see you twirl in that dress?

01:15:41.518 --> 01:15:42.753
Wow!

01:15:42.853 --> 01:15:45.789
What about your hair?
You should have a flower in it?

01:15:45.889 --> 01:15:49.325
- You don't think the veil is enough.
- You need a flower too, for the baby.

01:15:49.425 --> 01:15:54.197
What a sweet thought. You know, there is
one single white rose in the back garden.

01:15:54.297 --> 01:15:56.633
I'll get it, and then
we'll leave for the church, okay?

01:15:56.733 --> 01:16:00.003
Not in your dress. I'll do it.

01:16:00.103 --> 01:16:02.439
Oh, no, sweetie, there's thorns.
I'll get it in a second.

01:16:02.539 --> 01:16:07.011
I'm a big girl, Miss Meadows.
Besides, I have gloves on. See?

01:16:07.511 --> 01:16:09.746
Okay. Go ahead, but be careful.

01:16:09.846 --> 01:16:12.949
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome.

01:16:25.161 --> 01:16:28.164
Heather, it's okay.
I think the veil is enough.

01:16:28.264 --> 01:16:32.436
You know, I just remembered that my mom
said it's bad luck to pick the last flower,

01:16:32.536 --> 01:16:36.239
and I have this whole bouquet right here.
I'll save it for the baby.

01:16:36.339 --> 01:16:39.006
I just don't want to be late.

01:16:43.012 --> 01:16:44.581
Heather?

01:16:47.884 --> 01:16:50.554
Heather? Heather?!

01:16:50.854 --> 01:16:52.253
Heather?

01:17:22.252 --> 01:17:23.153
Heather!

01:17:23.253 --> 01:17:25.322
- Miss Meadows!
- I got you, sweetie.

01:17:25.422 --> 01:17:30.260
Late on your first day.
And a tad overdressed, but oh, well.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.763
- Stop, stop, stop. Give me that.
- No! No!

01:17:32.863 --> 01:17:36.500
I will cut your throat.
Now, no offence, Miss Meadows,

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.534
but you do tend to over-accessorize.

01:17:44.207 --> 01:17:47.311
Sheriff? She's never late.

01:17:47.711 --> 01:17:49.611
Never ever.

01:17:56.253 --> 01:17:58.689
You wouldn't let me come to your school.

01:17:59.389 --> 01:18:01.792
So I thought I'd bring you to mine.

01:18:01.892 --> 01:18:05.461
- I thought you said you changed.
- I did, and then I changed back.

01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:09.232
And that's what the system gets
for kicking a kid out of school.

01:18:09.332 --> 01:18:11.902
You can't teach an empty seat, can you?

01:18:12.302 --> 01:18:17.407
You know what they say,
you spare the rod, you spoil the child.

01:18:17.507 --> 01:18:21.709
- I don't agree with...
- Nobody cares! You're in my classroom!

01:18:23.546 --> 01:18:26.947
So you can shut up, okay?

01:18:28.884 --> 01:18:32.089
He says he's a teacher,
but I don't believe him.

01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:35.458
That's 'cause he's pretending.
He likes pretend, just like you.

01:18:35.558 --> 01:18:37.761
Just like Miss Meadows.

01:18:37.861 --> 01:18:42.933
Now, Heather, shall we continue
where we left off?

01:18:43.033 --> 01:18:46.837
Well, come on. Be excited!

01:18:46.937 --> 01:18:51.172
I honestly do not know
how you do this all day long.

01:18:55.478 --> 01:18:59.216
Go, go! Go come on, let's go!
We're gonna go come on.

01:19:02.018 --> 01:19:03.687
Run, Heather, run!

01:19:03.787 --> 01:19:07.225
- Get off me.
- Stop it! Sit down!

01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:11.728
- Get off me!
- Sit down. Sit down...

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:16.666
That's it. There we go. There we go.

01:19:16.966 --> 01:19:19.917
You really think you could just go off
and live happily ever after,

01:19:20.018 --> 01:19:23.874
while the rest of us struggle
to carve out any version of a life?

01:19:24.274 --> 01:19:27.107
I'm assuming that's rhetorical question?

01:19:46.596 --> 01:19:49.830
You think you're so much better than me.

01:19:50.567 --> 01:19:52.770
You think you're perfect.

01:19:53.370 --> 01:19:58.005
You wanna know something?
We're exactly the same.

01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:02.276
Exactly.

01:20:06.249 --> 01:20:09.417
Help! Help!

01:20:12.455 --> 01:20:16.224
He's got Miss Meadows!
He's got Miss Meadows!

01:20:19.162 --> 01:20:22.165
No! No! No! No!

01:20:22.265 --> 01:20:25.302
- Give it here!
- No! No, give it to me! Give it to me!

01:20:25.402 --> 01:20:27.504
Give me my purse! Give it to me!

01:20:27.604 --> 01:20:29.873
What's got you in such a fuss?

01:20:31.073 --> 01:20:33.377
What have we got here?

01:20:37.814 --> 01:20:40.002
- That's why you're so excited.
- No.

01:20:40.103 --> 01:20:42.786
- Is this thing real?
- It's not real. It's not real.

01:20:42.886 --> 01:20:46.223
- Really? Really? Is it? Is it?
- No, it's not.

01:20:47.819 --> 01:20:49.692
Oh, yes, it is real!

01:20:49.792 --> 01:20:52.696
- Don't do this.
- Crazy, arrogant...

01:20:52.796 --> 01:20:57.632
I am not crazy!
You are crazy, and I'm nothing like you!

01:20:59.302 --> 01:21:02.273
You really think you can save the world?

01:21:07.844 --> 01:21:11.514
How about you try saving yourself first?

01:21:11.614 --> 01:21:12.716
No! No!

01:21:21.291 --> 01:21:23.426
- Is that your gun?
- Yes.

01:21:24.826 --> 01:21:27.695
That's great. That's his prints now.

01:22:11.241 --> 01:22:13.441
You can have some.

01:22:46.576 --> 01:22:48.609
Dinner's gonna be late.

01:23:01.057 --> 01:23:02.790
It won't take long.

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:14.004
Mommy has to go,
but she always comes back.

01:23:14.104 --> 01:23:18.208
If others need what I can spare,
I must with them my treasures share.

01:23:18.708 --> 01:23:19.743
Bye.

01:23:20.743 --> 01:23:24.145
- Be careful.
- I always am.

01:23:25.281 --> 01:23:27.248
Toodle-oo.

01:23:38.728 --> 01:23:43.129
<i>You keep playing
where you shouldn't be playing</i>

01:23:44.367 --> 01:23:48.369
<i>And you keep thinking
that you'll never get burnt</i>

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:55.645
<i>I just found me
a brand new box of matches, yeah</i>

01:23:55.745 --> 01:24:00.447
<i>What he knows
you ain't got time to learn</i>

01:24:01.451 --> 01:24:04.521
<i>These boots are made for walking</i>

01:24:04.621 --> 01:24:07.557
<i>And that's just what they'll do</i>

01:24:07.657 --> 01:24:13.530
<i>One of these days these boots
are gonna walk all over you</i>

01:24:15.498 --> 01:24:17.734
<i>Are you ready boots?</i>

01:24:17.834 --> 01:24:20.034
<i>Start walking</i>

01:24:29.479 --> 01:24:34.717
<i>We'll be fine, I'm sure
Just use the other door</i>

01:24:34.817 --> 01:24:40.623
<i>I wanna have a house like they did</i>

01:24:40.723 --> 01:24:46.729
<i>We wrestled till we cried
They fucked our state of mind</i>

01:24:46.829 --> 01:24:52.869
<i>Don't celebrate me 'cause I'm jaded</i>

01:24:53.169 --> 01:24:58.575
<i>Welcome to the storm
We're babies till we're born</i>

01:24:58.675 --> 01:25:04.547
<i>Then adults from our first day
Breathing</i>

01:25:04.647 --> 01:25:10.386
<i>Our innocence was staged
The jury all got paid</i>

01:25:10.486 --> 01:25:16.590
<i>I'd lock it but it's not worth stealing</i>

01:25:17.694 --> 01:25:23.729
<i>When the drunks start singing this way</i>

01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:29.835
<i>Baby's got her best dress stained</i>

01:25:30.039 --> 01:25:35.612
<i>I hope you got a minute
Hope you want me in it</i>

01:25:35.712 --> 01:25:39.282
<i>For the long haul</i>

01:25:39.382 --> 01:25:43.849
<i>All night long</i>

01:25:45.922 --> 01:25:52.091
<i>When the drunks start singing this way</i>

01:25:52.195 --> 01:25:58.197
<i>Baby's got her best dress stained</i>

01:25:58.401 --> 01:26:03.706
<i>I hope you got a minute
Hope you want me in it</i>

01:26:03.806 --> 01:26:07.510
<i>For the long haul</i>

01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:12.144
<i>All night long</i>

01:26:12.715 --> 01:26:16.886
<i>It must get better than this</i>

01:26:16.986 --> 01:26:21.888
<i>'Cause as far as I can see</i>

01:26:23.092 --> 01:26:27.894
<i>The world belongs to me</i>

01:26:29.098 --> 01:26:33.870
<i>There's a place at your table</i>

01:26:33.970 --> 01:26:38.138
<i>With my name on</i>

01:26:39.609 --> 01:26:45.348
<i>When we walk they roll
the carpet out at our feet</i>

01:26:45.448 --> 01:26:51.254
<i>And when we talk they gather around
and cheer in the street</i>

01:26:51.354 --> 01:26:56.025
<i>'Cause we're the kings
of imagining things</i>

01:26:56.125 --> 01:27:01.994
<i>When the drunks start singing this way</i>

01:27:02.265 --> 01:27:08.233
<i>Baby's got her best dress stained</i>

01:27:08.438 --> 01:27:13.743
<i>I hope you got a minute
Hope you want me in it</i>

01:27:13.843 --> 01:27:17.547
<i>For the long haul</i>

01:27:17.647 --> 01:27:22.147
<i>All night long</i>

01:27:25.154 --> 01:27:30.693
<i>We'll be fine I'm sure
Just use the other door</i>

01:27:30.793 --> 01:27:36.063
<i>I wanna have a house like they did</i>

01:27:37.305 --> 01:27:43.792
