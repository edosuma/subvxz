00:42.741 --> 00:44.109
Hey.

00:44.944 --> 00:46.610
Where's your bag?

00:46.612 --> 00:48.077
I forgot it.

00:48.079 --> 00:49.783
You didn't bring anything?

00:51.417 --> 00:52.982
I got some change.

00:52.984 --> 00:54.653
Oh... I've dropped
it.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.591
- Let's go.
- All right. Come on.

01:05.697 --> 01:08.297
Ooh, that car just drove away.

01:08.299 --> 01:10.170
He was like, pow pow.

01:21.046 --> 01:22.115
What's up?

01:34.359 --> 01:37.197
'Cause yours...

01:44.436 --> 01:47.440
Oh, now. Oh.
What the hell was that?

01:51.677 --> 01:53.142
- See the ocean?
- Yeah.

01:53.144 --> 01:54.881
It means the Staples Center
is that way.

02:07.992 --> 02:09.360
Ninety-eight.

02:17.635 --> 02:18.905
Ninety-nine.

02:29.814 --> 02:31.216
Hundred.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.171
<i>That's what's up.
She's out. She's out.</i>

03:29.540 --> 03:31.708
<i>She picked up her hand.
She's out.</i>

03:31.710 --> 03:33.609
<i>She's done, Mike.</i>

03:33.611 --> 03:36.412
<i>So, we just passed 40 hours
here, which is, uh...</i>

03:36.414 --> 03:39.215
<i>This is usually when people
start dropping off like flies.</i>

03:39.217 --> 03:41.118
<i>You know, you kinda
have to go inside.</i>

03:41.120 --> 03:44.588
<i>Um, it's not just standing there
with your hand in a car, you know.</i>

03:44.590 --> 03:46.722
<i>It's more of a spiritual
experience for me.</i>

03:46.724 --> 03:50.393
<i>I think that's why I went.
You know, I went...</i>

03:50.395 --> 03:54.633
<i>I think focus, drive,
and some strength, obviously.</i>

03:55.933 --> 03:57.534
<i>There are not that
many big dogs out there.</i>

03:57.536 --> 03:58.937
<i>I'm the biggest of them all.</i>

03:59.805 --> 04:00.836
<i>The wolf.</i>

05:56.065 --> 05:58.001
- What up, Alex?
- What up, dude?

05:58.669 --> 06:00.137
Check this out.

06:05.609 --> 06:06.844
What is this?

06:07.476 --> 06:09.313
It's a survival contest.

06:10.380 --> 06:12.216
What did you
draw this with? Crayons?

06:23.025 --> 06:24.525
- What's up, player?
- What's up?

06:24.527 --> 06:25.826
- How's it going?
- It's all right.

06:25.828 --> 06:27.631
- How you doing?
- Good.

06:39.676 --> 06:41.176
Hey, Sage.

06:41.178 --> 06:42.477
Hey, Edison.

06:42.479 --> 06:44.849
Hey, Sage, check this out.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.686
Dude, what is this?

06:49.419 --> 06:51.055
It's a secret contest.

06:51.688 --> 06:53.487
Skate contest?

06:53.489 --> 06:55.392
No, a survival contest.

06:58.061 --> 06:59.430
We can win money?

07:00.262 --> 07:01.198
Yeah.

07:05.335 --> 07:06.803
Uh... nah.

07:07.703 --> 07:09.739
Dude, you drew this.

07:26.890 --> 07:27.955
Dude, I did draw it,

07:27.957 --> 07:30.758
but I copied it
from the Internet.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.862
See, there's a truck full
of skateboards and $1,000.

07:34.864 --> 07:37.965
Whoever can hold on the longest
without letting go wins.

07:37.967 --> 07:40.438
- Huh?
- You gotta hold on like this.

07:44.039 --> 07:45.607
You gotta hold on like this.

07:45.609 --> 07:47.378
But you can't let go,
no matter what.

07:48.811 --> 07:50.380
What about to pee?

07:51.248 --> 07:52.315
No matter what.

07:53.784 --> 07:55.316
Dude, that's easy.

07:55.318 --> 07:58.652
But you have to be at the Staples
Center tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

07:58.654 --> 08:01.422
- Staples Center?
- We can sleep there tonight.

08:01.424 --> 08:03.724
Isn't that like 100 miles?

08:03.726 --> 08:06.162
Nah, it's only 12.
I mapped it.

08:09.832 --> 08:11.969
Just think about
all that money.

08:14.003 --> 08:16.737
- And the skateboards.
- All right.

08:16.739 --> 08:19.873
Just tell your mom you're staying
at my house for a school project.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.309
I can do whatever I want.

08:21.311 --> 08:24.380
And my house is so big,
they don't even know I'm gone.

08:25.048 --> 08:26.851
Meet at the pier after dark?

08:28.118 --> 08:29.017
All right.

08:29.019 --> 08:31.956
Okay. Bye, Sage.
I gotta go get ready.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.152
What's up, scrappy?

09:05.154 --> 09:07.154
<i>Finish
on a high note. Dessert.</i>

09:07.156 --> 09:10.360
<i>Three full courses.
Just $12.95...</i>

09:14.029 --> 09:16.497
I swear to God.
This is over.

09:16.499 --> 09:17.965
What's all this, huh, Janice?

09:25.641 --> 09:27.207
What, now
you're upset with me?

09:27.209 --> 09:28.945
Yeah,
maybe I am.

09:29.612 --> 09:30.945
Baby, you know, come on.

09:30.947 --> 09:33.116
I'll break your hand
if you touch that money.

09:34.650 --> 09:36.587
Get out.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.322
Don't... Baby,
don't worry about it.

09:42.324 --> 09:44.360
Don't worry about it.
It's all good. It's fine.

09:46.630 --> 09:47.998
Come here.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.778
- See you later, man.
- Yeah.

11:48.818 --> 11:50.884
Yo, what up, sucker?

11:50.886 --> 11:52.186
Listen, you boys
behave tonight.

11:52.188 --> 11:53.488
Chris, don't be a jerk
to your brother.

11:53.490 --> 11:56.460
Mom, I have a show tonight.
No babies allowed.

11:59.328 --> 12:01.030
Are you for real?

12:01.997 --> 12:04.165
Mom, can I go
to Jake's tonight?

12:04.167 --> 12:06.834
I have a science project
for school.

12:06.836 --> 12:09.005
Since when are you
doing science?

12:12.042 --> 12:14.207
Yeah. I'll drop you off,
all right?

12:14.209 --> 12:15.643
Just get your stuff,
get ready.

12:15.645 --> 12:17.612
Grab your backpack. Let's go.

12:17.614 --> 12:19.283
Chris, you're off the hook.

12:25.822 --> 12:27.254
<i>♪ Yeah, money ♪</i>

12:27.256 --> 12:29.092
<i>♪ Money, money, uh ♪</i>

12:35.932 --> 12:39.303
Hey, give this to Jake's mom.
Tell her to call me if she needs anything.

12:46.643 --> 12:48.045
Sage, wait.

12:49.279 --> 12:51.012
Don't worry about James. We...

12:51.014 --> 12:52.515
We don't need
his help anyway.

13:10.766 --> 13:12.566
- See the ocean?
- Yeah.

13:12.568 --> 13:14.604
It means the Staples Center
is that way.

13:15.105 --> 13:16.407
Let me show you.

13:24.981 --> 13:27.683
Dude, put that away
before we get robbed.

13:29.018 --> 13:31.622
- Seriously?
- Seriously. Put it away.

13:44.733 --> 13:48.337
- Sage, I'll lead.
- Three, two, one.

13:50.106 --> 13:52.109
Three, two, one.

14:43.193 --> 14:44.794
$1.75.

14:47.263 --> 14:50.263
Two dollars twenty cents.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.898
Two dollars and twenty cents.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.700
I want a bear claw.

14:53.702 --> 14:55.204
I'm not buying them.

14:56.239 --> 14:58.342
My mom makes me wait
in the car here.

14:59.275 --> 15:00.443
Don't be a wuss.

15:08.851 --> 15:10.117
What do you want?

15:10.119 --> 15:11.719
Can we have a bear claw?

15:11.721 --> 15:14.457
Chocolate twists
and four donut holes.

15:18.528 --> 15:20.264
$4.30.

15:25.168 --> 15:26.570
Four dollar.

15:27.270 --> 15:28.838
We only have $2.20.

15:30.606 --> 15:31.942
So sorry.

15:34.644 --> 15:36.310
Hey, Song.

15:36.312 --> 15:38.479
How about a dozen
of those glaze?

15:38.481 --> 15:39.980
Already
have them ready for you.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.882
Holy crap,
it's a real life pirate.

15:41.884 --> 15:43.587
Mm-hmm. Sure.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.721
Why'd he
order so many?

15:47.723 --> 15:48.958
Mmm-mmm.

15:50.626 --> 15:51.928
Goodnight, boys.

15:57.232 --> 15:59.367
Goodnight, Song.

15:59.369 --> 16:02.472
Kids, Mr. Karl,
for you the rest.

16:09.746 --> 16:10.813
Goodnight, Song.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.803
We need to eat a lot so we're
not hungry at the contest.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.307
Sometimes I forget
to eat breakfast.

16:40.677 --> 16:41.878
That's nothing.

16:42.812 --> 16:44.644
Sometimes I don't eat
until after school,

16:44.646 --> 16:46.814
'cause school lunches
are nasty.

16:46.816 --> 16:48.285
Yeah, they are.

16:57.327 --> 16:59.093
There's the bus.
Come on.

16:59.095 --> 17:00.731
Let's catch the bus,
come on.

17:06.836 --> 17:08.305
Come on!

17:22.117 --> 17:23.849
We're not supposed
to take the bus.

17:23.852 --> 17:26.423
We're not supposed
to be out all night either.

17:27.289 --> 17:29.123
Did you see the people
at the bus stop?

17:29.125 --> 17:31.428
They're crazy.
They'll kill us.

17:35.765 --> 17:38.802
Fine. Game of Skate.
You lose, we take the bus.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.674
One, two.

17:46.676 --> 17:48.912
All right, all right.
One, two three.

17:53.349 --> 17:54.685
Don't turn around.

17:58.688 --> 18:00.390
Dude, relax.

18:00.857 --> 18:01.925
See, watch.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.460
Hey.

18:03.892 --> 18:05.225
He's fine.

18:25.180 --> 18:26.949
Whoo! Okay.

18:30.186 --> 18:31.554
You're fucking up.

18:32.854 --> 18:35.057
Ooh, man.

18:36.958 --> 18:39.126
Oh...

18:44.266 --> 18:45.800
Flip it.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.874
Oh, damn!

18:54.877 --> 18:56.510
Whoo...

19:03.319 --> 19:04.784
Ooh!

19:06.121 --> 19:07.423
Oh, no!

19:08.524 --> 19:10.124
You don't
want that to happen.

19:12.995 --> 19:14.497
Oh, you suck.

19:17.934 --> 19:19.132
Oh!

19:19.134 --> 19:20.503
One more try.

19:23.339 --> 19:24.508
Argh!

19:29.845 --> 19:31.046
Good game.

19:39.522 --> 19:42.356
Dude, my brother's friends
always take the bus.

19:42.358 --> 19:43.927
See? They might see us.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.596
Hey, let's go look for
a roof or something.

19:48.598 --> 19:50.697
Maybe we can see
how far we are.

19:50.699 --> 19:52.366
Nah, that's
the wrong way, though.

19:52.368 --> 19:54.604
We'll need a skyscraper
to see downtown.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.006
Let's just keep going.

19:57.907 --> 19:58.975
All right.

20:31.073 --> 20:33.543
Hey, what's the farthest
place you've ever been?

20:34.342 --> 20:37.176
Uh, I think Mexico.

20:37.178 --> 20:40.848
I've been to Minnesota,
Michigan, and Philadelphia.

20:40.850 --> 20:42.252
So much farther.

20:53.996 --> 20:56.233
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

21:00.669 --> 21:02.104
Oh, shit!

21:02.938 --> 21:03.907
Run!

21:17.352 --> 21:19.587
Come on, dude!

21:19.589 --> 21:21.888
Damn!
You're an idiot!

21:21.890 --> 21:24.527
Why'd you have to
knock on the van?

21:44.947 --> 21:46.283
Come on!

22:02.898 --> 22:05.601
That's not okay, dude.
I'm not built for this.

22:06.636 --> 22:08.204
Shut up.
You're fine.

22:17.979 --> 22:21.148
My mom talks about these
camper freaks all the time.

22:21.150 --> 22:23.352
They probably steal kids
and they sell them.

22:26.889 --> 22:28.158
Holy shit!

22:30.258 --> 22:32.760
Shoot. This is the bus.

22:32.762 --> 22:35.361
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me.

22:35.363 --> 22:36.629
Please don't kill me.

22:36.631 --> 22:38.564
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

22:38.566 --> 22:41.203
Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

22:45.707 --> 22:47.209
It's okay. Come on.

23:02.224 --> 23:04.824
<i>Would you
rather have $1,000,</i>

23:04.826 --> 23:06.959
<i>or be able to
breathe underwater?</i>

23:06.961 --> 23:09.965
<i>Um...
Breathe underwater, for sure.</i>

23:11.100 --> 23:13.500
<i>I'd rather
have $1,000.</i>

23:13.502 --> 23:16.869
<i>Then I could pay for my mom
not to work for a whole month.</i>

23:16.871 --> 23:19.773
<i>And we could go to Disneyland,
Chuck E. Cheese,</i>

23:19.775 --> 23:21.708
<i>and go to the movies.</i>

23:21.710 --> 23:23.345
<i>And then I can get
a new skateboard.</i>

23:24.513 --> 23:26.112
<i>If you could
breathe underwater,</i>

23:26.114 --> 23:28.482
<i>you could hide and scare
people at the beach,</i>

23:28.484 --> 23:29.949
<i>and see when sharks come in,</i>

23:29.951 --> 23:32.186
<i>and look at girls' butts.</i>

23:32.188 --> 23:35.289
My brother, Chris,
he always talks about ass.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.657
Ass this. Ass that.

23:37.659 --> 23:39.396
"Dat ass tight."

23:40.830 --> 23:44.063
And titties.
He loves titties.

23:44.065 --> 23:45.698
Titties are pretty cool.

23:45.700 --> 23:49.203
Would you rather be invisible
or shoot fire out of your butt?

23:49.205 --> 23:51.170
Fire out your butt?

23:51.172 --> 23:53.742
Chris, he lights
his farts on fire.

23:56.211 --> 23:59.314
Invisible. Everything would
be easier to do.

24:02.284 --> 24:04.187
Wait. Will anybody see me?

24:04.919 --> 24:08.155
No. Invisible forever.

24:08.157 --> 24:11.457
Fire then.
I could use it for self defense.

24:11.459 --> 24:14.360
And he'd
smell like a burnt fart, too.

24:16.599 --> 24:18.898
I wish I had a brother
to burn farts with.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.904
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Me and Chris hang out a lot.

24:23.872 --> 24:26.476
Hey, maybe we can see
downtown from up there.

24:29.644 --> 24:31.477
If only I just had
some Internet,

24:31.479 --> 24:33.415
I could have
checked on the map.

24:35.383 --> 24:38.320
Chris, he gets his Internet
from Starbucks.

24:39.188 --> 24:41.123
He doesn't even
buy anything, though.

24:42.056 --> 24:44.259
I thought you had
Internet at your house?

24:45.226 --> 24:46.760
Yeah, we got all that.

24:46.762 --> 24:49.596
Cable, Netflix, video games...
All that shit.

24:49.598 --> 24:51.165
What I meant to say was

24:51.167 --> 24:53.736
Chris just goes to Starbucks
when he's not home.

24:54.136 --> 24:55.769
Oh.

24:55.771 --> 24:57.804
My mom wouldn't even
buy me a TV.

24:57.806 --> 24:58.974
You're lucky.

25:01.075 --> 25:03.609
Internet should
be free everywhere.

25:03.611 --> 25:05.448
Like invisible Internet
right here.

25:07.615 --> 25:09.084
And over here.

25:10.518 --> 25:11.987
And over here.

25:16.158 --> 25:17.427
Ah!

25:39.547 --> 25:43.417
<i>I'm really tired, dude.
Come on, let's take the bus.</i>

25:43.419 --> 25:46.255
No, dude, I told you.
We're not taking the bus.

25:46.589 --> 25:48.024
Wow.

25:49.057 --> 25:50.159
Fine.

25:51.826 --> 25:54.494
I promise it's all right.

25:54.496 --> 25:56.131
I take the bus all the time.

25:56.966 --> 25:58.165
It's so fun on the bus.

25:58.167 --> 26:00.370
You know how there's
all those bars in there?

26:00.835 --> 26:02.002
People hold on.

26:02.004 --> 26:04.036
I always
swing around on 'em.

26:04.038 --> 26:05.539
Last time I went on the bus,

26:05.541 --> 26:08.375
I was swinging around
the whole entire thing.

26:08.377 --> 26:10.944
It's just... Watch out for people.
Don't like...

26:10.946 --> 26:13.312
If you swing,
look out for people.

26:13.314 --> 26:15.415
Don't hit 'em.

26:15.417 --> 26:18.388
But yeah, they don't...
They never really care.

26:23.859 --> 26:25.361
It's me and him.

26:27.563 --> 26:29.265
I thought you only had change?

26:32.001 --> 26:33.833
Does this bus
go to downtown?

26:33.835 --> 26:35.438
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:46.681 --> 26:48.250
Hey, yo, Edison.

26:50.185 --> 26:51.421
Hey, Edison.

26:53.155 --> 26:54.290
Look.

26:57.426 --> 26:59.128
- Come on.
- No.

27:00.428 --> 27:01.794
Dude, come over here.

27:01.796 --> 27:02.966
Come on.

27:07.503 --> 27:09.302
Come on. Don't be a wuss.

27:09.304 --> 27:10.606
Come back here.

27:11.105 --> 27:12.140
Fine.

28:25.781 --> 28:27.317
Where's your backpack?

28:44.132 --> 28:46.068
We got to get off the bus.

29:05.019 --> 29:07.622
Yo, kid.
Is that your backpack?

29:12.061 --> 29:13.629
Some money in that backpack?

29:23.938 --> 29:25.608
Is that your backpack?

29:44.092 --> 29:45.958
I didn't know
you speak Spanish.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.360
I'm Mexican, stupid.

29:48.362 --> 29:51.031
You told me nothing bad
was gonna happen. And see?

29:51.033 --> 29:52.565
Nothing bad did happen.

29:52.567 --> 29:55.068
You're supposed to be helping
me, not trying to get me killed.

29:55.070 --> 29:57.036
Helping you?
Why would I be helping you?

29:57.038 --> 29:59.275
Only one of us can
win the money, Edison.

30:05.246 --> 30:07.249
We're helping each other,
aren't we?

30:09.685 --> 30:11.187
I mean, I guess.

30:27.936 --> 30:29.105
Here.

30:31.506 --> 30:32.641
You see this?

30:35.274 --> 30:36.446
So, go like this, side.

30:37.312 --> 30:38.811
In.

30:38.813 --> 30:40.749
Out. Careful, it's sharp.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.285
All right.

30:47.089 --> 30:48.524
You got that,

30:49.024 --> 30:50.493
I got these.

30:52.561 --> 30:54.163
Feel better now?

30:58.100 --> 30:59.401
Yeah.

31:20.788 --> 31:22.257
Know where we are?

31:29.931 --> 31:31.133
I got an idea.

31:49.418 --> 31:51.217
Did you hear that?

31:51.219 --> 31:52.854
Mm-hmm.

31:54.255 --> 31:56.225
Maybe somewhere over here.

31:59.328 --> 32:01.329
Wait, no. It's more this way.

32:04.399 --> 32:06.802
- Shh. Be quiet.
- I'm trying.

32:12.940 --> 32:14.643
I see somebody. Come on.

32:21.015 --> 32:23.349
Yeah, there's more
service here.

32:23.351 --> 32:25.188
Who's out there?

32:26.255 --> 32:27.987
Get down! Stop moving.

32:27.989 --> 32:29.622
Don't make me
shoot you.

32:29.624 --> 32:30.956
We're dead!

32:32.593 --> 32:36.399
I want the lights up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

32:41.602 --> 32:42.772
Sorry, lady.

32:44.406 --> 32:46.375
What do you think
you're doing?

32:47.342 --> 32:49.842
She doesn't even
have a gun.

32:49.844 --> 32:52.448
We're lost, and we're
trying to find some Internet.

32:52.948 --> 32:54.113
Internet?

32:54.115 --> 32:55.884
What are you gonna do
with the Internet?

32:56.918 --> 32:57.986
For the iPad.

32:58.453 --> 32:59.789
iPad?

33:02.457 --> 33:04.392
You boys like whisky?

33:08.063 --> 33:10.299
We aren't old enough
for that yet.

33:11.733 --> 33:12.768
Says who?

33:13.935 --> 33:15.004
Everyone.

33:22.244 --> 33:24.246
Nana 911.

33:26.515 --> 33:27.382
What?

33:28.050 --> 33:29.685
That's the password.

33:36.557 --> 33:37.492
Thank you.

33:40.996 --> 33:42.262
It worked.

33:42.264 --> 33:44.567
All right.
Where are you boys off to?

33:45.667 --> 33:47.466
We're on our way
to the Staples Center.

33:47.468 --> 33:49.738
No, we're not.
We're going home.

33:56.178 --> 33:58.144
What's at the Staples Center?

33:58.146 --> 34:00.580
Y'all going to
a Clippers game?

34:02.184 --> 34:05.084
Mr. Wilson took me
to a Clippers game

34:05.086 --> 34:07.486
for my 80th birthday.

34:07.488 --> 34:08.955
Dude, seven miles left.

34:08.956 --> 34:10.391
Almost halfway.

34:10.992 --> 34:12.391
Barely going anywhere.

34:12.393 --> 34:15.159
Ooh. We took that
new metro line.

34:15.161 --> 34:17.799
Mm! Real nice train.

34:19.967 --> 34:21.667
Did you say train station?

34:21.668 --> 34:25.338
Yeah. Oh, about
two blocks over there

34:25.340 --> 34:27.476
across the boulevard.

34:28.576 --> 34:31.878
Love me some Blake Griffin.

34:31.880 --> 34:36.851
He jumped over that car.
Whoo-wee!

34:38.452 --> 34:42.925
But I know it's way too damn
late for a Clippers game.

34:46.427 --> 34:47.728
Come clean.

34:48.996 --> 34:50.065
Spill it.

35:00.909 --> 35:02.475
Our dad's in the military,

35:02.477 --> 35:04.943
and he's got us on
this scavenger survival hunt.

35:04.945 --> 35:06.945
And if we can make it
to the Staples Center,

35:06.947 --> 35:08.881
we pass the test.

35:08.883 --> 35:10.149
And if we pass the test,

35:10.151 --> 35:12.588
we get to go to, uh...

35:13.354 --> 35:14.689
Oh, yeah, Disneyland.

35:15.423 --> 35:16.990
Yeah, we're brothers.

35:16.992 --> 35:19.528
Dad's out there waiting
for us to keep us safe.

35:23.197 --> 35:26.265
You boys watch a lot
of TV, don't you?

35:26.267 --> 35:28.901
Mom says TV is bad for you,

35:28.903 --> 35:30.539
and just a waste of time.

35:31.872 --> 35:34.740
I like me a good movie.

35:34.742 --> 35:37.813
I didn't get TV
till I was old.

35:38.447 --> 35:40.916
And that keeps me up late.

35:41.749 --> 35:44.085
I can't skateboard anymore.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.490
I'm going to get Mr. Wilson

35:48.322 --> 35:50.058
to take you to your house.

35:51.392 --> 35:53.028
To your mama's house.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.227
Mr. Wilson!

35:55.229 --> 35:57.733
You are not gonna
believe this!

36:33.200 --> 36:34.533
Oh, look!

36:34.535 --> 36:36.104
Let's go in.

36:38.006 --> 36:39.809
The train station!

36:44.345 --> 36:46.412
Have you ever
been on the train?

36:46.414 --> 36:48.648
No. You?

36:48.650 --> 36:51.718
I think when I was
super little, with my mom.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.756
Hey, look.
Over there, come on.

37:07.068 --> 37:08.571
Mmm...

37:11.039 --> 37:12.638
It says how far we go.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.510
I think I just
pushed a button.

37:18.646 --> 37:20.582
It says $5 for a ticket.

37:21.182 --> 37:22.651
I only have $5.

37:23.251 --> 37:25.019
Hey, I can sneak in under.

37:26.921 --> 37:28.086
Okay.

37:33.227 --> 37:34.394
Hey, it's working!

37:34.396 --> 37:35.698
Yes!

37:40.968 --> 37:42.171
Let me see.

37:43.939 --> 37:45.941
Hey, come on.
Let's go upstairs.

38:10.831 --> 38:12.867
It's better
on the train than here.

38:14.468 --> 38:15.938
Yeah, you're right.

39:07.822 --> 39:09.657
We missed the train.

39:11.425 --> 39:12.524
What?

39:18.198 --> 39:20.336
The last one came
30 minutes ago.

39:28.677 --> 39:30.813
Dude, I told you to hurry!

39:31.211 --> 39:32.845
I'm sorry.

39:32.847 --> 39:34.213
You're too scared
all the time.

39:34.215 --> 39:35.818
Acting like a little bitch.

40:09.184 --> 40:10.252
Hey, yo. Wait.

40:24.264 --> 40:26.134
You were really gonna
leave without me?

40:27.535 --> 40:28.803
Yup.

40:44.753 --> 40:46.155
Don't be mad.

41:25.559 --> 41:27.262
Dude, raisins?

41:27.829 --> 41:29.061
I'd rather eat turds.

41:49.784 --> 41:51.783
Ew. What is this?

41:51.785 --> 41:54.222
Hotdog sandwiches.
They're my favorite.

42:01.595 --> 42:04.396
Mm. I'm so full
from the donuts.

42:09.871 --> 42:11.870
It's a crazy man.

42:11.872 --> 42:14.909
<i>♪ I ride the bicycle... ♪</i>

42:18.079 --> 42:19.412
- Shit!
- Back up, dude!

42:19.414 --> 42:22.117
- Back up! Back up!
- Don't turn at me!

42:26.653 --> 42:28.322
I didn't mean to startle you.

42:35.762 --> 42:37.498
I... I ruined your sandwich?

42:42.803 --> 42:44.437
You can have 'em.

42:44.439 --> 42:45.808
Yeah, mine, too.

42:50.477 --> 42:51.479
Back up.

43:05.425 --> 43:06.961
This is really good.

43:09.396 --> 43:10.832
You must be the chef.

43:11.532 --> 43:12.965
I'm just Edison.

43:12.967 --> 43:15.037
And this is
my bodyguard, Sage.

43:19.273 --> 43:23.311
Bodyguard Sage.
It's my lucky day.

43:28.048 --> 43:30.082
Where are you two going?

43:30.084 --> 43:32.017
Uh, we're on our way
to Staples Center,

43:32.019 --> 43:33.588
but we missed the last train.

43:50.704 --> 43:51.973
Ah!

43:55.610 --> 43:57.111
I owe you for the sandwich.

43:59.514 --> 44:00.615
I have rope.

44:01.282 --> 44:02.150
Rope?

44:02.883 --> 44:04.218
Hold that.

44:11.758 --> 44:14.362
- Oh. Okay.
- Oh.

44:17.264 --> 44:20.134
All right, boys,
Arthur at your service.

45:32.305 --> 45:33.275
Oh, yeah!

45:35.910 --> 45:37.709
Dude! Arthur!

45:39.414 --> 45:40.749
You okay, Arthur?

45:53.994 --> 45:55.329
You did a flip.

45:57.731 --> 45:59.266
You were flying.

46:08.008 --> 46:09.307
You...

46:09.309 --> 46:12.077
You guys gotta go on
without me.

46:12.079 --> 46:14.512
We can't just
leave you here, Arthur.

46:14.514 --> 46:16.684
It's just a few
more miles that way.

46:17.617 --> 46:19.151
I promise.

46:19.153 --> 46:20.753
It'll be okay.

46:20.755 --> 46:22.423
I'm just gonna lie here.

46:28.963 --> 46:30.399
All right.

46:31.932 --> 46:33.735
Wait, wait, wait.

46:40.041 --> 46:41.410
Take this.

46:44.177 --> 46:46.447
Take this with you.

46:47.881 --> 46:49.383
Bye, Arthur.

47:05.867 --> 47:07.502
Oh! Hey, look.

47:08.769 --> 47:10.202
Those are nice.

47:10.204 --> 47:11.370
I need to get one.

47:11.372 --> 47:13.175
- You like onions?
- Yeah.

47:16.878 --> 47:18.080
Come on.

47:26.988 --> 47:28.123
Look at that.

47:30.758 --> 47:32.694
Oh, that looks so good.

47:59.086 --> 48:00.188
Hmm.

48:00.720 --> 48:01.822
I saw boobs last week.

48:03.858 --> 48:06.791
My brother and a girl were
doing sex FaceTime things,

48:06.793 --> 48:08.229
and I saw it all.

48:09.896 --> 48:11.232
What did they look like?

48:12.200 --> 48:13.468
Like boobs.

48:14.535 --> 48:15.570
How big?

48:16.604 --> 48:19.637
Probably like a peach,
or a small orange.

48:19.639 --> 48:20.875
Not the big kind.

48:25.479 --> 48:27.682
Hey... Hey, let me see
the piece of cardboard.

48:41.329 --> 48:43.430
Hey, you got a marker
in your backpack?

48:44.131 --> 48:45.367
Yeah.

48:52.472 --> 48:53.440
Thanks.

49:11.992 --> 49:13.661
Sorry for calling you a bitch.

49:19.032 --> 49:20.332
It's okay.

49:20.334 --> 49:21.834
I am sometimes.

49:22.936 --> 49:24.503
<i>Tricks for tacos.</i>

49:24.505 --> 49:28.039
Come on.
Help us get some tacos.

49:28.041 --> 49:30.242
Imagine the fear
of my little friend,

49:30.244 --> 49:32.311
trying to ollie over me.

49:32.313 --> 49:34.046
Tricks for tacos.

49:34.048 --> 49:36.450
Come on.
Help us get some tacos.

49:37.218 --> 49:39.654
Even a dollar or two
will help.

49:44.124 --> 49:47.225
Come on. Two tacos.
My friend over there is very hungry.

49:47.227 --> 49:49.664
Me, too.
He'll ollie over me.

49:52.332 --> 49:53.867
You're so cute.

49:55.302 --> 49:56.769
Well, let me
see some tricks,

49:56.771 --> 49:59.506
and then, maybe I'll
give you some money.

50:07.782 --> 50:10.548
- Okay. Come on, babe.
- All right. I guess I'm gonna have to...

50:10.550 --> 50:14.119
You got $4. But I wanna
see him ollie over you.

50:14.121 --> 50:15.389
All right.

50:16.423 --> 50:17.856
- Thank you.
- All right.

50:17.858 --> 50:18.994
We have a winner.

50:21.061 --> 50:22.396
We have a winner.

50:23.164 --> 50:24.262
It's easy. Just go fast.

50:24.264 --> 50:25.463
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

50:25.465 --> 50:26.934
Here, give me your backpack.

50:41.414 --> 50:42.816
You can do it.

50:44.385 --> 50:46.321
The girlfriend thinks
you can do it.

50:52.425 --> 50:54.660
All right. Ready?

50:54.662 --> 50:55.697
Yeah.

51:00.300 --> 51:02.166
I need you to...
I need you to really...

51:02.168 --> 51:03.501
- Like, that was real.
- Do it again.

51:03.503 --> 51:05.269
Let me see it
on the front side.

52:12.907 --> 52:14.042
Holy crap!

52:15.175 --> 52:16.378
What?

52:17.610 --> 52:19.311
It's 2:00 in the morning.

52:19.313 --> 52:20.749
Dang!

52:22.081 --> 52:24.017
And the battery's almost dead.

52:28.588 --> 52:30.157
We need to plug this in.

52:31.224 --> 52:32.559
I'll be back.

53:22.776 --> 53:24.175
Hey.

53:24.177 --> 53:25.212
What's up, little dude?

53:26.146 --> 53:27.448
Nice car.

53:27.747 --> 53:29.080
Thanks.

53:29.082 --> 53:31.552
Hey, I was wondering if you
could help me and my homeboy out.

53:47.233 --> 53:48.902
Downtown's kind of far, dude.

53:49.970 --> 53:50.872
Please?

53:51.372 --> 53:53.338
Oh, no.

53:53.340 --> 53:55.108
I gotta take my buddy
to Hollywood.

53:55.976 --> 53:57.276
Kind of out of my way.

53:57.278 --> 53:58.913
I can't go downtown
right now.

53:59.213 --> 54:00.481
Please?

54:09.322 --> 54:11.158
Hey, I got us a ride
from Ricardo.

54:12.358 --> 54:13.727
Come on.

54:16.262 --> 54:17.829
I gotta tell you something.

54:17.831 --> 54:20.101
What? I got us a ride,
but we have to hurry.

54:22.369 --> 54:24.035
Get up, fatty. Come on.

54:24.037 --> 54:25.137
Wait.

54:25.139 --> 54:27.809
Get up. I got us a ride,
but we have to hurry.

54:28.541 --> 54:30.441
The battery's barely charged.

54:30.443 --> 54:32.613
Who cares? Let's go.

55:07.381 --> 55:09.914
Why are you guys
trying to get downtown?

55:09.916 --> 55:13.220
To see who can hold on to
the car longest for $1,000.

55:14.488 --> 55:15.857
<i>Hands on a Hard Body?</i>

55:18.992 --> 55:20.561
I love that movie.

55:21.762 --> 55:23.260
What's that?

55:23.262 --> 55:24.329
"What's that?"

55:24.331 --> 55:26.164
Hey, show him the paper.

55:26.166 --> 55:28.767
It's a great ol'
documentary they made

55:28.769 --> 55:30.669
about a bunch of people
in a contest

55:30.671 --> 55:32.604
who put their hands on a car,

55:32.606 --> 55:34.640
last man standing wins.

55:34.642 --> 55:35.841
It's crazy.

55:35.843 --> 55:37.712
People will do anything.

55:41.749 --> 55:44.182
Hey, did you draw this?

55:44.184 --> 55:45.787
Yeah, from the Internet.

55:46.586 --> 55:48.188
It's pretty good, mister.

55:48.756 --> 55:52.090
You are an artiste.

55:52.092 --> 55:53.126
Thank you.

55:58.432 --> 55:59.734
Question.

56:00.501 --> 56:04.272
Where are your parents?

56:08.307 --> 56:09.943
I can do whatever I want.

56:12.512 --> 56:14.848
Relax, I'm just asking.

56:19.019 --> 56:20.484
My mom's a nurse.

56:20.486 --> 56:21.889
She works at night.

56:23.256 --> 56:25.226
And she goes to school, too.

56:26.793 --> 56:28.395
Well, what about your dad?

56:29.195 --> 56:30.797
He doesn't know his dad.

56:32.832 --> 56:35.966
He sends me stuff sometimes,
like my first skateboard.

56:35.968 --> 56:37.804
He's pretty cool like that.

56:44.410 --> 56:46.278
You never met him?

56:46.280 --> 56:48.015
My mom met him in Detroit.

56:57.925 --> 56:59.727
I never met my dad
either, Eddie.

57:06.767 --> 57:08.166
I'm gonna meet him though.

57:08.168 --> 57:10.303
- No, you won't, Edison.
- Shut up.

58:01.582 --> 58:03.985
- See you in a little bit?
- You got it, buddy.

58:08.724 --> 58:12.195
Well, boys, there she is.

58:12.727 --> 58:13.894
You live in a hotel?

58:13.896 --> 58:15.662
I work here.

58:15.664 --> 58:17.430
That was my lunch break.

58:17.432 --> 58:18.564
The late shift.

58:18.566 --> 58:21.901
Rico and I get tacos once a
week, don't we, Rico?

58:21.903 --> 58:23.206
Oh, yeah.

58:24.338 --> 58:29.376
Ah! Well, I'm back to work.
I will see you later.

58:29.378 --> 58:32.979
Boys... keep chasing
those dreams.

58:32.981 --> 58:35.218
- Bye, Marvin.
- Bye-bye, boys.

58:36.550 --> 58:40.887
Yo. You guys wanna hit
the skate spots in Koreatown?

58:40.889 --> 58:42.122
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:42.124 --> 58:43.392
I got my board in the trunk.

58:44.159 --> 58:45.227
Okay.

01:00:20.956 --> 01:00:23.224
Whoo!

01:00:28.697 --> 01:00:30.032
Shit.

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:37.706
Yo.

01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:40.409
Fuck.

01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:44.112
What do you mean
they need the car now?

01:00:48.749 --> 01:00:50.186
Okay. Later.

01:00:51.186 --> 01:00:53.689
Dudes. Yo, I gotta go.

01:00:55.122 --> 01:00:56.923
Go down Wilshire.

01:00:56.925 --> 01:00:59.892
It'll take you to the bridge,
see some construction, you'll see Staples.

01:00:59.894 --> 01:01:01.894
And if you don't find it,

01:01:01.896 --> 01:01:04.631
there's a 24-hour
McDonald's with Wi-Fi.

01:01:04.633 --> 01:01:08.337
You win the money, buy me lunch.
I'll see you later.

01:02:21.008 --> 01:02:24.146
Dude, Ricardo's such a jerk.
He just left us there.

01:02:24.912 --> 01:02:27.349
I don't see no McDonald's.

01:02:39.994 --> 01:02:41.663
I don't feel so good.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.001
You gonna throw up?

01:02:48.003 --> 01:02:49.438
I don't know.

01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:22.170
I can't breathe.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.242
What are you doing?

01:03:34.249 --> 01:03:35.718
I wanna call my mom.

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:46.858
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.394
I promise.

01:03:48.396 --> 01:03:50.832
Ricardo never would have
left us if it wasn't okay.

01:03:51.532 --> 01:03:52.500
Right?

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.715
I hate this right now.

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:11.486
You know, we'll be ten
by the time we get there.

01:04:21.061 --> 01:04:23.562
Don't look back,
just keep going.

01:04:23.564 --> 01:04:24.666
Come on.

01:04:34.642 --> 01:04:35.841
Run!

01:04:35.843 --> 01:04:37.313
Come on, Sage!

01:04:41.983 --> 01:04:43.519
They're coming!
They're coming!

01:04:47.988 --> 01:04:49.354
Come on, Edison!

01:04:49.356 --> 01:04:51.390
Keep going! Go!

01:04:51.392 --> 01:04:52.827
Edison, what are you doing?

01:05:05.273 --> 01:05:08.041
What's up, little dude?
What you got?

01:05:08.043 --> 01:05:09.644
Let me see that, man.

01:05:11.246 --> 01:05:13.046
Stay down. Let's see here.

01:05:13.048 --> 01:05:14.582
IPad, bro.

01:05:18.419 --> 01:05:19.519
Give it back.

01:05:22.157 --> 01:05:24.356
- Please.
- Aw, look at this photo.

01:05:24.358 --> 01:05:26.694
Your mommy and dad.

01:05:27.729 --> 01:05:28.897
You dick!

01:05:30.231 --> 01:05:31.530
Oh, shit.

01:05:32.633 --> 01:05:34.269
Punk ass kid.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.675
Little punk.

01:05:40.742 --> 01:05:41.910
Stop!

01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:50.283
What you gonna
do with that, kid?

01:05:50.285 --> 01:05:51.983
Come on, man.

01:06:05.867 --> 01:06:07.069
You okay?

01:06:11.939 --> 01:06:12.974
Yeah.

01:06:30.624 --> 01:06:32.057
I'm sorry.

01:06:32.059 --> 01:06:33.461
It's all my fault.

01:06:34.595 --> 01:06:36.597
At least they only
beat me up.

01:06:44.305 --> 01:06:46.075
They took everything.

01:06:53.046 --> 01:06:54.416
Fuck this.

01:07:00.287 --> 01:07:02.053
We're going to
the Staples Center.

01:07:02.055 --> 01:07:04.059
I'm going to win
that money.

01:07:04.925 --> 01:07:07.093
I'm going to be rich.

01:07:07.095 --> 01:07:08.964
I'm gonna have $1,000.

01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:11.834
You're funny.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.834
I'm gonna
eat donuts all day,

01:07:15.836 --> 01:07:17.472
play video games,

01:07:18.206 --> 01:07:19.807
and buy a new house.

01:08:12.392 --> 01:08:14.827
Holy shit! Look.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:17.895
That was the construction
Ricardo was talking about.

01:08:17.898 --> 01:08:20.198
My brother's never
gonna believe me.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.736
Believe what?

01:08:22.502 --> 01:08:23.769
That we
made it down here.

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:26.372
He doesn't think
I can do anything.

01:08:26.374 --> 01:08:28.374
I thought
your brother was awesome?

01:08:28.376 --> 01:08:29.608
I mean, he is.

01:08:29.609 --> 01:08:31.912
Just sometimes...
'cause I'm younger.

01:08:33.413 --> 01:08:34.649
Come on.

01:08:39.886 --> 01:08:41.456
Come on. Let's go!

01:08:51.733 --> 01:08:53.999
It's gotta be
behind those buildings.

01:08:54.001 --> 01:08:56.103
Come on, we can be
the first one in line.

01:09:47.287 --> 01:09:48.823
We're almost there,
come on.

01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:26.094
Come on.

01:10:38.238 --> 01:10:39.340
Whoa!

01:10:42.509 --> 01:10:43.978
Where is everyone?

01:10:53.588 --> 01:10:55.189
There should be people here.

01:11:02.062 --> 01:11:03.931
Maybe it's on
the other side.

01:11:07.035 --> 01:11:09.101
Why aren't you
saying anything?

01:11:09.103 --> 01:11:10.636
Just wait.

01:11:10.638 --> 01:11:12.307
Come on,
let's go on the other side.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.627
You said it was today.
Right, Edison?

01:11:34.629 --> 01:11:36.729
That's what you said.

01:11:36.731 --> 01:11:38.367
Yeah, that's what I said.

01:11:39.332 --> 01:11:40.635
Look.

01:11:44.539 --> 01:11:46.971
You said 8:00 a.m.

01:11:46.973 --> 01:11:49.043
Where's everyone?
Where's the truck?

01:11:52.345 --> 01:11:53.812
That's when the line starts.

01:11:53.814 --> 01:11:55.715
Maybe it doesn't start
till later.

01:11:55.717 --> 01:11:57.115
Is that what it said?

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.020
Can't remember.

01:12:01.022 --> 01:12:03.191
What do you mean
you can't remember?

01:12:04.192 --> 01:12:05.293
Edison?

01:12:05.893 --> 01:12:07.359
I can't remember, okay!

01:12:07.361 --> 01:12:08.863
Maybe it wasn't real.

01:13:30.812 --> 01:13:32.080
I made it up.

01:13:39.286 --> 01:13:40.354
You suck.

01:13:42.389 --> 01:13:43.788
Do it.

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:45.858
- Do it! Come on.
- Do what?

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.362
Hit me. Come on.

01:13:50.598 --> 01:13:52.000
Why did we come here?

01:14:01.942 --> 01:14:03.508
My dad will be here today.

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:05.179
Why would your dad
come here?

01:14:08.816 --> 01:14:12.019
My dad plays basketball
for Detroit.

01:14:12.652 --> 01:14:14.789
And they play LA today.

01:14:19.559 --> 01:14:21.062
You are stupid.

01:14:24.365 --> 01:14:26.599
This whole time,
you didn't tell me.

01:14:26.601 --> 01:14:27.900
All this way!

01:14:27.902 --> 01:14:30.135
You got me beat up
because you've been stupid.

01:14:30.137 --> 01:14:32.270
Your dad's a loser,
not a basketball player.

01:14:32.272 --> 01:14:34.842
You and your
stupid ass dreams, Edison.

01:14:36.277 --> 01:14:37.479
It's not a dream.

01:15:27.061 --> 01:15:30.162
My mom told me
when she met my dad,

01:15:30.164 --> 01:15:33.634
he played basketball
for the pros, in Detroit.

01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:38.503
That's why he
couldn't see us.

01:15:38.505 --> 01:15:40.040
He was always too busy.

01:15:41.142 --> 01:15:43.945
But then,
he stopped calling my mom.

01:15:44.946 --> 01:15:46.845
He didn't wanna
see her anymore.

01:15:46.847 --> 01:15:48.314
Not me.

01:15:48.316 --> 01:15:50.518
So, I'm gonna wait here
until I see him.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.156
I have his picture my
mom keeps in her room.

01:16:02.295 --> 01:16:03.365
It's him.

01:16:07.668 --> 01:16:10.671
I don't think you would have come
with me if I told you the truth.

01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.677
I lied,
and you should hate me.

01:16:25.251 --> 01:16:27.052
I lied, too.

01:16:27.054 --> 01:16:29.591
My brother... He's not cool.

01:16:30.924 --> 01:16:32.326
He hates me.

01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:35.627
And I don't have
a dad either.

01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:37.695
Just my mom's
stupid boyfriend.

01:16:37.697 --> 01:16:39.233
And he left us today.

01:16:40.934 --> 01:16:42.403
We live in a hotel.

01:16:43.903 --> 01:16:45.671
And my mom's broke.

01:16:45.673 --> 01:16:47.442
We're about to be kicked out.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.323
We're even now.

01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:05.593
You don't hate me?

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:09.160
Nah, this has been
the best night of my life.

01:17:09.162 --> 01:17:11.499
Except for getting beat up
and losing our skateboards.

01:17:43.997 --> 01:17:45.767
You little dudes okay?

01:17:46.534 --> 01:17:47.535
Yeah.

01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:52.570
Hey, you got
anything to drink?

01:17:52.572 --> 01:17:54.142
I'm really thirsty.

01:17:54.775 --> 01:17:56.010
Me, too.

01:17:56.677 --> 01:17:57.746
Where's your parents?

01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:02.150
Around.

01:21:24.653 --> 01:21:29.653
