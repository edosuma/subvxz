Laura, voice-over:
IT WAS SPRING,

01:42.061 --> 01:45.190
AND PA TOOK ALL OF US
WITH HIM TO MANKATO.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.650
IT WAS A WONDER
TO SEE THE CITY,

01:47.817 --> 01:49.402
BUT LIKE PA SAYS,

01:49.569 --> 01:51.696
IT'S A FINE THING
TO BE GOING HOME,

01:51.863 --> 01:56.242
AND BESIDES,
I MISSED MY DOG JACK.

02:03.708 --> 02:04.793
WHOA.

02:10.507 --> 02:12.217
WHAT'S WRONG,
CHARLES?

02:12.383 --> 02:13.593
NOTHIN', I'M SURE.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.305
JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS
WHEN I SEE MEN IN A HURRY.

02:25.939 --> 02:27.273
GOOD DAY TO YOU.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.733
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

02:28.900 --> 02:31.778
I'M JIM ANDERS, U.S.
MARSHAL OUT OF SLEEPY EYE.

02:31.945 --> 02:33.863
MY DEPUTIES HILL

02:34.030 --> 02:35.490
I'M CHARLES INGALLS.

02:35.657 --> 02:37.283
THIS IS MY WIFE.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.118
WE'RE CHASING
A SAVAGE,

02:39.285 --> 02:42.121
A RENEGADE SIOUX BY THE
NAME OF JACK LAME HORSE.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.958
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WERE ANY
SIOUX LEFT IN THESE PARTS.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.794
WELL, THERE WON'T BE,
SOON AS WE CATCH THIS'UN.

02:47.961 --> 02:50.296
I CAN'T HELP YOU.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

02:50.463 --> 02:51.798
MUCH OBLIGED.

02:51.965 --> 02:54.717
IF I WAS YOU FOLKS, I'D
START LOOKIN' FOR SHELTER.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.344
THERE'S A BLIZZARD
COMIN'.

02:56.511 --> 02:59.222
A STORM, MAYBE. A LITTLE LATE
IN THE YEAR FOR A BLIZZARD.

02:59.389 --> 03:02.141
WELL, NOW YOU CALL IT
WHAT YOU WANT TO, MISTER.

03:02.308 --> 03:03.560
BUT THAT'S
A BLIZZARD WIND.

03:03.726 --> 03:06.062
BOTH OF MY FEET
HAVE BEEN FROSTBIT TWICE.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.897
THEY TELL ME WHEN
A BAD ONE'S COMIN',

03:08.064 --> 03:09.399
AND THEY'RE
TELLIN' ME NOW.

03:09.566 --> 03:11.317
BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR
THAT SAVAGE, Y'HEAR?

03:11.484 --> 03:13.528
I WILL. WHAT DID
THIS LAME HORSE DO?

03:13.695 --> 03:17.073
HE GOT BORN.

03:19.701 --> 03:21.119
GOOD DAY, MA'AM.

03:21.286 --> 03:23.329
HYAH!

03:27.375 --> 03:29.836
HE CALLS THE INDIAN
A SAVAGE.

03:30.003 --> 03:31.087
HYAH!

03:43.683 --> 03:45.894
[WIND HOWLS]

04:16.466 --> 04:17.800
I COULD CUT ACROSS
PARKER POINT,

04:17.967 --> 04:19.177
BUT I'M AFRAID
TO TAKE A CHANCE.

04:19.344 --> 04:20.678
THIS WIND'S GOT ME
THINKING THAT FELLOW

04:20.845 --> 04:22.388
WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THE WEATHER.

04:22.555 --> 04:24.682
THE TEMPERATURE'S
DROPPING AWFULLY FAST.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.060
YOU BEST GET INSIDE
WITH THE GIRLS.

04:40.782 --> 04:41.824
Charles: YOU ALL SET?

04:41.991 --> 04:43.952
YES.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.746
HERE WE GO! HYAH!

05:08.559 --> 05:11.354
IT SURE IS COLD.

05:11.521 --> 05:14.482
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
SNUGGLE DOWN AND KEEP WARM.

05:19.988 --> 05:21.531
IT'S SNOWING!

05:28.162 --> 05:29.831
I KNOW, DEAR.

06:35.021 --> 06:37.565
PLACE IS DESERTED.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.112
EVERYBODY OUT.

06:45.615 --> 06:47.909
TAKE CARRIE INSIDE.

07:04.717 --> 07:07.261
Mary: OVER HERE.
COME ON, HURRY!

07:15.186 --> 07:17.355
LET ME WEDGE
THAT DOOR.

07:20.108 --> 07:22.443
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S GOT IT.

07:29.826 --> 07:32.120
WELL, WE GOT
4 WALLS AND A ROOF.

07:33.329 --> 07:36.040
AND A FIREPLACE.

07:36.207 --> 07:38.126
WE'RE IN LUCK.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.836
YOU GOT ENOUGH KINDLING
HERE TO GET A FIRE STARTED.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.921
I'LL GO OUT AND GET US
A LOAD OF WOOD.

07:42.088 --> 07:43.881
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THIS
PLACE'LL BE WARM AS TOAST.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.341
PAPA...

07:45.508 --> 07:47.093
I'M THIRSTY
AND HUNGRY.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.598
BETTER GET THIS
WINDOW FIXED BEFORE I LEAVE.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.100
Caroline:
No, I'LL Do THAT.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.227
GET SOME WOOD
BEFORE IT GETS DARK.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.062
YOU SURE?

07:58.229 --> 08:00.148
THE WOMEN
IN THIS FAMILY

08:00.314 --> 08:02.108
CAN MANAGE
QUITE NICELY.

08:02.275 --> 08:05.153
ALL RIGHT. SOME TOOLS
IN THE SUPPLY BOX.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.612
I'LL BE BACK SOON.

08:06.779 --> 08:09.490
MAKE SURE YOU BRACE
THIS DOOR GOOD.

08:33.264 --> 08:36.893
MARY, WILL YOU GET
THE FIRE STARTED?

08:37.059 --> 08:38.352
YES, MA.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.022
AND, UH...

08:41.189 --> 08:44.483

ABOUT THIS WINDOW.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.140
[WHINNIES]

09:47.630 --> 09:49.882
OOH. WELL, IT'S NOT
THE WORK OF A CARPENTER,

09:50.049 --> 09:51.550
BUT IT WILL KEEP SOME
OF THE WIND OUT.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.052
IT'S SNOWING
HARDER, MA.

09:53.219 --> 09:55.263
OH, I NOTICED
A FLAKE OR TWO.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.015
OOH! OH, THAT'S FINE, MARY.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.684
THE CHIMNEY DRAWS
VERY WELL, DOESN'T IT?

09:59.850 --> 10:00.935
UH-HUH.

10:01.102 --> 10:03.562

10:06.649 --> 10:07.692
WITH SOME WOOD,

10:07.858 --> 10:10.152
AND WE'LL MAKE
A BIG, WARM FIRE.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.862
WHEW!

10:12.029 --> 10:14.240
WE GONNA HAVE A BLIZZARD
LIKE THE MAN SAID?

10:14.407 --> 10:15.950
WE'VE GOT A STORM.

10:16.117 --> 10:17.410
ISN'T A BLIZZARD YET.

10:17.576 --> 10:18.995
WE'LL JUST HOPE IT
DOESN'T TURN INTO ONE.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.579
WHAT IF IT DOES?

10:20.746 --> 10:21.872
WELL, WE'LL JUST MAKE DUE.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.916
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
COLD WEATHER BEFORE.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.127

11:54.673 --> 11:58.344
I WAS WORRIED
YOU WERE SO LONG.

11:58.511 --> 12:00.471
I CAN'T MOVE
VERY FAST IN THIS.

12:00.638 --> 12:03.849
SUPPER'S READY.
CAN'T YOU EAT NOW?

12:04.016 --> 12:06.185

JUST HAD ENOUGH FOOD
TO GET US FROM MANKATO.

13:04.535 --> 13:07.580

THERE CAN'T BE MUCH LEFT.

THAN 2 FEET OF SNOW OUT THERE.

13:47.077 --> 13:50.039
IF IT STOPPED RIGHT NOW,
WE'D BE IN TROUBLE.

SNUGGLE DOWN
AND GO BACK TO SLEEP.

14:50.808 --> 14:52.768
SURE, MA.

15:06.532 --> 15:07.950
THE LONGER THEY SLEEP,

15:08.117 --> 15:10.786
THE LESS TIME THEY'LL HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT BEING HUNGRY.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.871
YOU DIDN'T SLEEP
AT ALL.

HE'S THE LAW.
