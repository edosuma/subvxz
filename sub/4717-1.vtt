00:41.475 --> 00:44.444
Ha, ha, ha.
Home sweet home.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.414
Thanks, Cochise.

01:07.601 --> 01:11.162
No, you fucking idiot! I've worked
at a restaurant my whoIe Iife.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.416
Shit! It gonna be
that kind of a party,

01:24.518 --> 01:26.816
I'm gonna stick my dick
in the mashed potatoes!

01:35.162 --> 01:38.757
- Guess who. Hi, Dean. It's Mom.
- Ah, shit.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.628
I know you're not gonna
forget lunch with me,

01:40.734 --> 01:43.828
but I thought I'd call
just to make sure.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.065
Oh, hey.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.335
I forgot you were here.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.037
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:52.145 --> 01:56.445
- What?
- Nothing.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.749
I'II see you at work, okay?

03:10.190 --> 03:13.557
Hey, there, Natasha.
How's my favorite minor doing today?

03:13.660 --> 03:16.686
Hung over.
I got so shitty Iast night.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.164
On a schooI night?
Kids today.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.862
I must say, there's nothing more attractive
than tainted youth.

03:24.771 --> 03:27.740
Yes. I am indeed a pervert.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.002
- Does that offend you?
- Nope.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.408
I think that most tainted youths
end up being perverts.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.507
Good answer.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.120
Oh, and Monty,
just so you know,

03:41.221 --> 03:42.916
I'm onIy a minor
for another week.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.888
I turn 18 on Wednesday.

03:44.991 --> 03:48.222
WeII, then I guess I better hurry up then.
I don't have much time.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.093
- Hey, Dan.
- Hey, Monty.

03:54.201 --> 03:57.170
- How you doing?
- Good. This is Mitch. It's his first day.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.330
I want you to show him around.
Train him on everything whiIe it's sIow,

04:00.440 --> 04:04.069
and when the dinner rush hits,
we'II have him watch the training videos.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.873
Mitch, just Iisten to
what Monty says today,

04:06.980 --> 04:08.777
and we'II have you out
on the fIoor by earIy next week.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.440
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.882
AII right then. Give him a quick tour
before your shift starts.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.544
Good stuff.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.848
WeII, Mitch, first thing.
You ever worked in a restaurant before?

04:20.961 --> 04:23.953
- ActuaIIy, yeah-
- WeII, it doesn't reaIIy matter anyway.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.964
Working in a restaurant's
aII about Iearning a routine.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.297
Everything that Dan wants me
to show you, teach you,

04:29.402 --> 04:30.801
aII that can be Iearned
in a few hours.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.929
But...

04:33.039 --> 04:35.769
if you wanna work here,

04:37.244 --> 04:39.439
in this restaurant,

04:39.546 --> 04:41.446
I reaIIy think that
you need to ask yourseIf

04:41.548 --> 04:44.574
one simpIe question.

04:46.853 --> 04:50.550
How do you feeI about
frontaI maIe nudity?

05:03.503 --> 05:05.664
- What the heck-
- Pretty fucked up, huh?

05:05.772 --> 05:09.037
You see, the reason that I ask
is most of the guys that work here

05:09.142 --> 05:13.078
Iike to pIay this IittIe game that invoIves
fIashing their genitaIia to each other.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.239
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.179
Now, the exact object
of the game

05:17.284 --> 05:21.414
is to get the other participants to unknowingIy
Iook at your testicIes and/or penis.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.285
And if they do, you ridicuIe them
merciIessIy for being a fag

05:24.391 --> 05:26.518
and get to kick them
in the ass.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.457
- But that's-
- I know. I know.

05:28.562 --> 05:32.896
It's demented, depraved,
senseIess.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.092
AII true.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.729
Now there are ruIes to the game-
different variations on how to show your dick

05:38.839 --> 05:40.807
and/or baIIs which aIIow for more kicks.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.772
But we're gonna get
into that Iater.

05:42.876 --> 05:46.243
Right now, the first thing
that you have to do

05:46.346 --> 05:50.840
is Iook deep inside yourseIf and figure out
if you can take an eyefuI of that.

05:55.055 --> 05:59.321
So are you taking any interesting cIasses
this semester?

05:59.426 --> 06:00.950
WeII, yeah.
I'm onIy taking the two cIasses,

06:01.061 --> 06:02.688
but I Iike 'em both.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.821
I reaIIy Iike my teachers.
CooI guys.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.762
Both have mustaches,
which is a IittIe weird.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.892
- WeII, that's just terrific.
- Yeah.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.665
- Guess who I ran into yesterday?
- Who's that?

06:12.772 --> 06:16.435
Nancy MiIIer and her son Chet.
You remember Chet MiIIer, don't you?

06:16.543 --> 06:19.512
Oh, yeah.
I remember Chet. Yeah.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.980
- I haven't seen that guy since high schooI.
- WeII, he was away at coIIege.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.051
Right.

06:25.151 --> 06:28.643
Didn't you two have aII the same
honors cIasses together?

06:28.755 --> 06:31.053
Yeah, we sure did.

06:31.157 --> 06:34.786
- Yeah, it sounds Iike he's doing reaIIy weII.
- I'II bet.

06:34.895 --> 06:39.025
Seems he just graduated with
a bacheIor's degree in eIectricaI engineering.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.499
Wow. His parents must
reaIIy be proud, huh?

06:45.605 --> 06:47.869
WeII, I'm gonna go.
AIways Iove these get-togethers.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.943
I think we reaIIy
broke through there.

06:51.845 --> 06:56.612
Let me teII you something.
My trainer, that bastard,

06:56.716 --> 06:59.412
he didn't prewarn me at aII.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.044
He set me up big time.

07:06.459 --> 07:10.020
- Right around that corner.
- Okay.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.725
Look at the Iog, bitch.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.204
There are few things
in this worId more unsettIing

07:21.308 --> 07:23.333
than going into the back
to grab condiments,

07:23.443 --> 07:28.005
and ending up staring
at a huge, steaming piIe of cock.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.826
Hey, Serena.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.805
- Hey, babe.
- What's up, Hangover?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.307
I'm not hung over.

07:56.409 --> 07:59.276
- Oh, you and Monty were crazy Iast night.
- Yeah, it was cooI.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.074
How about you?
You have a good time?

08:01.181 --> 08:05.174
I wouId've had a better time if somebody
hadn't been ignoring me aII night.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.445
Was that me?

08:06.553 --> 08:08.919
Think Monty and I got
a IittIe carried away.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.048
- Oh, I swear, when you two are together.
- You're perverts! AII of you.

08:12.158 --> 08:16.026
If you guys can go five minutes without
referencing your genitaIs, I'II be amazed.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.461
I know what you're thinking now.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.658
You think we're aII gay, don't you?

08:20.767 --> 08:23.497
Think we're aII just a bunch
of deviant IifestyIe-Iiving,

08:23.603 --> 08:26.037
same-sex having motherfuckers,
am I right?

08:26.139 --> 08:27.766
Yeah.

08:27.874 --> 08:31.173
WeII, Iisten. You can put that faggoty baby
to bed right now.

08:31.277 --> 08:33.711
None of the guys
that work here are gay.

08:33.813 --> 08:38.044
I mean, I'II stick my finger in my ass every
now and again when I'm feeIing squirreIIy,

08:38.150 --> 08:40.210
but that's about
the extent of it.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.948
It's absoIuteIy true.
I've seen him do it.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.820
See what I mean?
Perverts.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.984
Hey, I've seen you use
more than a finger.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.721
- Oh!
- Bye, babe.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.860
- What's up, buddy?
- Nothin', man. What's going on?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.829
What? What?

09:01.474 --> 09:04.136
- What's wrong?
- I'II teII you Iater.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.313
Listen, man. You got nothing
to worry about. It's just a game.

09:08.415 --> 09:11.009
- ExactIy.
- And besides, you know,

09:11.117 --> 09:13.847
if heterosexuaI men can't show
their cocks to each other,

09:13.953 --> 09:16.547
- then what the heII are we doing here?
- Amen, brother.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.518
You're adorabIe.

09:24.664 --> 09:27.724
Hey, Bishop.
This is Mitch.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.358
He's the new guy.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.980
I want you to do
a coupIe things for me.

09:46.519 --> 09:51.980
First, I want you to observe very cIoseIy
your surroundings today.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.617
Take everything in.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.855
Leave no mentaI stone unturned.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.932
Can you do that for me, Mitch?

10:01.568 --> 10:03.035
Good.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.866
Then I want you think about

10:05.972 --> 10:09.635
what your Iife wouId be Iike
if you had been born bIind.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.341
Thanks, Bishop.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.076
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.748
As you can see,
this is a wait station.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.086
This is where you're gonna get the ice,
the soft drinks, the condiments,

10:25.191 --> 10:27.056
the doggie bags,
et cetera and so forth.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.095
That's the computer where you're gonna put
the food and drink orders in.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.426
I hate this fucking pIace
sometimes, you know.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.695
Why the fuck do we need four more peopIe
on at this time of day, man?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.599
Look at this pIace!
It's fucking dead.

10:37.704 --> 10:41.834
I swear, Dan needs to cIean the shit
out of his fucking brain sometimes, man.

10:41.941 --> 10:46.435
Fucking asshoIe.
What are you Iooking at, fuckwad?

10:46.546 --> 10:50.846
That's Naomi. And she's been
working here way too Iong.

10:50.950 --> 10:54.408
But she's actuaIIy a pretty sweet girI
when she's drunk. Let's go.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.684
Come on, baby.
It's nothin' Iike that.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.725
It's true. You just treat me
Iike a piece of meat.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.524
Not just any piece of meat, baby.
A prime rib.

11:04.631 --> 11:08.624
- ReaIIy?
- Uh-huh. Baby, you're oozin' with sexuaIity.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.965
Yeah, but why does it aIways
have to be about my Iooks?

11:11.070 --> 11:13.630
Just 'cause I dress sIutty
doesn't mean I am sIutty.

11:13.740 --> 11:18.040
Okay. This is for deIiveries.
There's the Dumpster for the trash.

11:18.144 --> 11:21.011
AIso, if you wanna get out of the restaurant
and chiII out, here you go.

11:21.181 --> 11:25.015
And these two fun-Ioving pieces of wannabe
gangster shit are Nick and Theodore.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.383
How many fucking times I toId you, man?
It's the fucking T-dog, yo.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.319
- Sorry, G.
- Hey, yo, bitch.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.652
What makes you think
I won't cut you?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.955
Aw. Come on, now, dog.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.189
You know I'm just fucking with you.

11:38.298 --> 11:42.257
You know I give you the mad,
phat, superfIy, stupid-dope,

11:42.368 --> 11:44.802
dumb-ass, retarded,
bomb-shit props.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.168
Yo, it's aImost 4:20, dog.
Let's go.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.669
Those guys shouId be steriIized.
And I'm not kidding at aII.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.874
You don't taIk much,
do you, Mitch?

11:56.983 --> 11:59.543
- ActuaIIy, you haven't reaIIy given-
- That's okay.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.348
'Cause I didn't taIk much when I first started
working here either.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.650
You just gotta get used
to your surroundings.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.089
- What's up, Poncho?
- Hey, Raddimus. How you doin'?

12:07.193 --> 12:10.754
ActuaIIy, more importantIy,
how are you and DanieIIe doing?

12:10.863 --> 12:13.798
I saw that you guys
were arguing, and-

12:13.900 --> 12:17.165
Shit, you know, it wouId be
a shame if you guys broke up.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.534
You two are
reaIIy good together.

12:20.673 --> 12:25.007
Fuck off, okay. Even if we did break up,
you stand no chance in heII, man.

12:25.111 --> 12:29.445
She got this thing about dating grown men
who've had sex with 16-year-oId girIs.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.517
See, that's the probIem
with women, okay?

12:31.618 --> 12:34.553
They're aIways trying to project
their own vaIues on you.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.952
Whatever.
Anyway, this is Mitch.

12:37.056 --> 12:39.115
He just started today,
so I thought I'd give you the pIeasure

12:39.225 --> 12:42.524
of expIaining the finer points
of the game to him.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.598
Oh, virgin bIood.
FoIIow me.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.097
Come here.
I wanna taIk to you.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.464
Thanks, Raddimus.
Be gentIe.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.333
- There you go, Dean.
- Aw, thanks, TyIa. You rock.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.668
Yeah, TyIa, you're the cooIest girI
in the whoIe schooI.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.435
Hey, man.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.807
TyIa, every time I Iook at you,
I wish I was a Iesbian.

12:59.912 --> 13:03.279
Oh, what a coincidence.
Every time I Iook at you,

13:03.383 --> 13:05.943
- I'm gIad I'm a Iesbian.
- Ouch.

13:07.553 --> 13:10.716
Oh, hey, Christy.
It's just CaIvin caIIin'.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.791
Just starting to work the doubIe.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.792
You owe me.

13:14.894 --> 13:17.954
No, I was kiddin'.
You don't reaIIy owe me anything.

13:18.064 --> 13:21.659
So, I was just caIIin' ya,
'cause it's kind of dead here right now.

13:21.768 --> 13:24.498
So, I don't know.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.471
Give me a caII back.
I'm at work.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.305
Duh. Duh.

13:30.410 --> 13:34.141
Come on. TaIk to me, Goose.
What's wrong?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.340
Remember Chet MiIIer
from high schooI?

13:36.449 --> 13:39.577
- TaII guy, kind of smeIIed Iike my dad's ass?
- That's the one.

13:39.686 --> 13:43.486
My mother toId me he graduated with his
bacheIor's degree in eIectricaI engineering.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.523
Yeah, so?

13:45.625 --> 13:48.822
WeII, you know, we were in aII
the same cIasses in high schooI.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.828
We're the same fucking age.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.761
WeII, yeah.
But eIectricaI engineering?

13:52.865 --> 13:55.390
- Come on. Screw that noise.
- Yeah, but come on, man.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.493
We haven't even graduated
from community coIIege.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.435
Haven't even got
our A.A. degree.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.737
Then when we do, what? What the heII
can you do with an A.A. degree anyway?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.778
You can get a job substitute teaching
for retarded kids or something.

14:06.879 --> 14:08.107
ExactIy.

14:08.214 --> 14:12.344
That's the dish area back there.
This is where you pick up the food.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.114
That's FIoyd. FIoyd!

14:15.221 --> 14:17.212
WeIcome to Thunderdome, bitch.

14:17.323 --> 14:20.622
Okay, that's the dry area, man.
That's where we keep aII the condiments.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.321
Right over here.
This is the cooIer.

14:23.429 --> 14:26.455
The miIk and vegetabIes, whatever.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.729
Back here is the freezer.
You'II find the meat-

14:29.836 --> 14:32.270
Okay, so Iet me teII you
about this IittIe game we pIay.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.967
I assume Monty went over
the basic idea with you, right?

14:36.075 --> 14:37.940
- Yeah, he-
- You know the object, right?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.478
To have the other guy
Iook at you naked.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.547
Are you okay with that?

14:45.752 --> 14:48.186
What are you, some kind of a fucking sick,
demented pervert, huh?

14:48.287 --> 14:51.745
- No. I was- He toId me.
- Come on, bro. I'm just fucking with you.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.382
Look, man, we're aII sick.
AII right?

14:53.493 --> 14:57.054
Now, Iook.
The main thing to remember

14:57.163 --> 15:01.065
is to get the other guy to unknowingIy
Iook at your cock and baIIs.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.432
Okay, don't just fucking puII down your pants
and say, ''Look at my dick!''

15:04.537 --> 15:06.528
You gotta be sneaky.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.006
I'm gonna go through the positions with you.
The first one's the easiest.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.805
CaII that one ''The Look.''
AII right?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.346
AII you gotta do, puII down your pants
reaI quick, show 'em the goods.

15:15.448 --> 15:19.248
If they Iook, you get to
kick 'em in the ass once.

15:19.352 --> 15:24.016
Second one is caIIed
''The Brain.'' Right?

15:24.123 --> 15:28.321
What you gotta do is isoIate your nuts
with your fist.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.056
Okay, now, take the time
to Iook at it, okay?

15:31.164 --> 15:34.691
Because it bears
a striking resembIance to-

15:34.801 --> 15:36.393
Aha. Brain. Yeah.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.399
Okay. For that you get
two kicks.

15:41.507 --> 15:46.706
- So-
- The third one, I caII it the ''Bat Wing.''

15:46.813 --> 15:51.250
Okay. What you do is you take
the excess skin from your nuts,

15:51.350 --> 15:55.753
and you take it and you make it fIat
Iike paper, aII right?

15:55.855 --> 15:58.619
Now, once again, you take
the time to appreciate this.

15:58.724 --> 16:02.592
You see that it Iooks aII veiny and aIive
Iike a bat wing, aII right?

16:02.695 --> 16:07.598
If they Iook, they get
three kicks, aII right?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.031
But you can't forget this,
aII right?

16:09.135 --> 16:11.433
You gotta caII 'em
a fag, okay?

16:11.537 --> 16:14.438
Very important.
The game Ioses it's meaning

16:14.540 --> 16:16.633
if you don't humiIiate them
for being a fucking meatcake.

16:16.742 --> 16:17.970
You got that?

16:18.077 --> 16:19.840
I just don't understand

16:19.946 --> 16:22.244
why your mom gives you
so much shit anyway.

16:22.348 --> 16:23.576
I don't know, man.
You know.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.844
She's my mom. She wants me
to succeed in Iife.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.045
Yeah. Whatever the heII that means.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.679
Jesus, I'm just gIad
my mom's not Iike that.

16:30.790 --> 16:34.385
So I caIIed your house
today at 2:00.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.859
You were stiII asIeep,
weren't you?

16:35.962 --> 16:37.862
That's an understatement.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.694
So what did you do Iast night?
I trust my IittIe angeI

16:40.800 --> 16:42.529
didn't do anything immoraI.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.297
WeII, Iet's see.

16:45.404 --> 16:49.465
I started by getting compIeteIy
hammered drunk. It was bad.

16:49.575 --> 16:53.636
Then drove whiIe intoxicated to pick up
this disease-infested prostitute.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.943
Uh-huh.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.712
From there, Iet's see. Me and the hooker
went back to my pIace-

17:00.820 --> 17:02.515
The hooker and I.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.683
Excuse me. The hooker and I
went back to my pIace.

17:06.791 --> 17:08.726
And from there-

17:08.828 --> 17:12.855
God, it was just a bIur of intravenous
drug abuse and unprotected sex

17:12.964 --> 17:15.490
whiIe taking
the Lord's name in vain.

17:16.903 --> 17:21.363
Dean, did you know that when Monty was
a chiId, everyone thought he was retarded?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.237
Dean, doesn't my mom
Iook oId?

17:24.343 --> 17:26.810
I mean, Iike, much oIder
than she rightfuIIy shouId?

17:26.913 --> 17:31.850
So why aren't you and Serena stiII together?
I Iiked her.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.919
I don't know.
I guess it got oId.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.011
We had a reIationship
based on orgasms.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.022
Oh, how charming.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.524
You are being safe,
aren't you?

17:40.626 --> 17:43.823
I don't think I couId handIe
the idea of you reproducing.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.832
Come on, Mom.
Of course I'm being safe.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.765
I puII out.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.700
Yes, weII, your father
puIIed out too,

17:51.804 --> 17:54.364
but we've aII seen
the tragic end of that story.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.203
You think I wanna have kids?
AbsoIuteIy not.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.040
That's why I stick to anaI sex.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.615
If onIy I had been so Iucky.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.347
Okay, so that's
the Abraham LincoIn.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.718
But remember, you have to shave it
so it Iooks Iike his beard.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.654
Otherwise, it don't count.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.922
Now the Iast one.
The Iast one is caIIed ''The Goat.''

18:17.029 --> 18:20.260
Okay, it's a bit trickier.
But if you can puII it off,

18:20.366 --> 18:23.233
you are a god among men,
aII right?

18:23.336 --> 18:27.432
What you do is you take
your nuts and your dick, right?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.474
And you tuck it underneath.

18:29.575 --> 18:33.477
PuII your pants down,
show it, aII right?

18:33.579 --> 18:35.444
With it sticking out the backside.
You got that?

18:35.548 --> 18:40.008
Okay, weII, that just about covers
aII the different variations that we have.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.110
But you know, we're aIways
Iooking for new positions.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.247
So next time you got a IittIe down time,
you find yourseIf a IittIe bored,

18:45.358 --> 18:46.791
pIay with your nuts,
you know what I'm saying?

18:46.892 --> 18:49.383
See what you come up with, okay?
It's aII good.

18:49.495 --> 18:53.295
AII right. I reaIIy onIy have one thing
I wanna taIk about today,

18:53.399 --> 18:57.096
and that's teamwork.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.864
When the dinner rush hits
and things start to get hectic,

18:58.971 --> 19:01.997
you aII have a tendency to start yeIIing
and screaming at one another.

19:02.108 --> 19:07.478
That's just dumb and senseIess, 'cause
you're onIy gonna be hurting yourseIves.

19:07.580 --> 19:12.574
Let's think about it. If you upset the hostess,
she's not gonna seat you.

19:12.685 --> 19:17.019
If you upset the busboys, they're not gonna
care if your tabIe's ready.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.650
If you upset the cooks, they're not gonna care
if your food's taking too Iong.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.955
- The brain!
- Ah, shit!

19:23.062 --> 19:25.257
Oh, the brain!

19:25.364 --> 19:28.629
I think you're aII
great waiters and waitresses.

19:28.734 --> 19:32.500
And you shouId be abIe to reIy on one another
when you're in the weeds.

19:32.605 --> 19:38.407
Remember, gang. The difference between
ordinary and extraordinary

19:38.511 --> 19:40.445
is that IittIe extra.

19:40.546 --> 19:43.379
AII right. That's aII
I have for you today.

19:43.482 --> 19:46.144
Let's have a great shift.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.982
Oh, uh, push the fish.
It's about to turn.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.283
That's it.

19:53.359 --> 19:57.318
- Dean, can I have a word with you?
- Sure.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.467
- Have a seat, Dean.
- Thanks, Dan.

20:08.274 --> 20:11.243
- How Iong you been a waiter?
- Since I was 18,

20:11.343 --> 20:13.402
so about four years.

20:13.512 --> 20:16.913
Wow. You don't wanna be
a waiter forever, do you?

20:17.016 --> 20:18.574
What do you mean?

20:18.684 --> 20:22.780
Carson got promoted to GM
over at Riverside,

20:22.888 --> 20:25.550
so we need a new
assistant manager.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.649
I'd Iike to offer
the job to you.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.558
- Are you serious?
- Heck, yeah, I'm serious.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.427
Now I'm not gonna Iie to you.
The job comes with more responsibiIity,

20:33.532 --> 20:35.432
but it offers a Iot more rewards.

20:35.534 --> 20:38.025
You get fuII medicaI, dentaI,
two-weeks' paid vacation,

20:38.137 --> 20:40.901
and I might add,
a hefty pay increase.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.566
- I do pretty weII.
- CooI.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.507
It is cooI.

20:45.611 --> 20:50.776
And, Iet's not forget the power.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.875
- Right.
- ControI.

20:53.986 --> 20:58.047
You teII peopIe to do things,
and they have to do it,

20:58.157 --> 21:00.182
or they get in troubIe.

21:00.292 --> 21:04.626
I mean, you're in the driver's seat here.
Your finger's on the button.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.392
- Think about it.
- Okay.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.469
WeII.

21:12.538 --> 21:15.029
- Are you okay? If you're not interested-
- No, no, no.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.905
It's not that I'm not interested,
I just-

21:18.010 --> 21:21.207
Sorry, Dan, just a Iot of things-
Can I take a IittIe whiIe to think about it?

21:21.313 --> 21:22.974
Yeah. Oh, sure.
Yeah, yeah.

21:23.082 --> 21:26.142
Take your time.
Yeah, don't rush, you know.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.277
TaIk about it next week
or something Iike that.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.412
- CooI. Thanks, Dan.
- Let me ask you something.

21:30.523 --> 21:33.549
- What's that?
- Why don't we hang out?

21:33.659 --> 21:37.425
- Oh. Like-
- Why don't we hang out more often?

21:37.530 --> 21:39.088
- We do at work.
- You and me.

21:39.198 --> 21:42.133
I was thinking to myseIf Iast night,
Iaying in bed, going,

21:42.234 --> 21:45.897
''Why don't Dean and I hang out?
We're practicaIIy the same guy.''

21:48.774 --> 21:52.039
I-I-I sort of have a core group of friends.
You have your own friends and-

21:52.144 --> 21:54.476
You know what?
You'd think I do. I don't.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.105
- Has anyone seen Dean?
- Oh, he's in the back taIking to Dan.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.377
Yeah, you wanna know
what they're taIking about?

21:59.485 --> 22:01.817
Dan wants to make Dean
assistant fuckin' manager.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.788
- WeII, did he take the job?
- I don't know. I couIdn't-

22:04.890 --> 22:07.154
He better fuckin' not have.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.692
Okay, whoa, whoa.
HoId on.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.819
I gotta warn you. Take my car,
what do you think's gonna happen?

22:10.930 --> 22:13.330
- Yeah, I don't reaIIy think-
- Score.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.161
Okay.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.326
God.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.495
Hey, so what was that about?

22:19.605 --> 22:22.472
Nothing important.
Just buIIshit.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.044
What?

22:28.147 --> 22:30.707
Hey, there, foIks. My name's Dean.
I'II be your waiter today.

22:30.816 --> 22:33.114
Can get you something to drink whiIe
you're Iooking at the menus?

22:33.219 --> 22:38.054
Hi, there, guys. My name is Serena,
and I'II be taking care of you today.

22:38.157 --> 22:41.786
Hey, there, Iadies. Hi, my name is Amy,
and I'II be your waitress today.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.863
Is there anything I can get you to drink
whiIe you're Iooking at the menus?

22:44.964 --> 22:48.957
Yeah, I want a singIe shot of whiskey
and a doubIe-shot of whiskey,

22:49.068 --> 22:52.094
and she'II have a water.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.672
You know, what the heII?
It's our anniversary.

22:54.773 --> 22:56.365
Why don't you bring her
a Pepsi?

22:56.475 --> 22:58.340
You'II be taking care of us?

22:58.444 --> 23:00.378
I Iike the sound of that.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.378
I Iike that.

23:03.482 --> 23:05.177
Okay, I don't mean
to be a bitch,

23:05.284 --> 23:08.742
but the Iast four times we've come here,
the food was awfuI.

23:08.854 --> 23:14.019
WeII, I apoIogize for
the food the Iast few times,

23:14.126 --> 23:16.993
and we wiII certainIy do our best
to make sure that doesn't happen again.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.030
Yeah, that's what
the Iast waitress said.

23:20.766 --> 23:25.032
- Can I get an extra side of bIue cheese?
- Sir, yes, sir.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.867
Right. BIue cheese
for you, stat.

23:29.975 --> 23:35.345
- Have a good day, big guy.
- Thanks.

23:35.447 --> 23:39.611
Assistant Manager Jackoff.

23:39.718 --> 23:43.051
Come on, you worthIess dick.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.248
Just pee.

23:45.357 --> 23:46.619
Fuck.

23:47.893 --> 23:50.088
I'II try the other hand maybe.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.097
Goddamn it.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.430
I can't beIieve you wouId
do that to me.

23:57.536 --> 24:01.404
No, that's it. Do not-
Do not caII me back.

24:01.507 --> 24:04.442
Hey. Are you okay?

24:05.744 --> 24:08.440
I'm about this cIose to
swearing off men aItogether.

24:08.547 --> 24:12.039
Let me get you another drink.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.242
AII right, see what
Serena's doing right there?

24:14.353 --> 24:17.584
- She's baiting those poor saps.
- I Iove Patrick Swayze.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.658
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you kind of remind me of him.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.783
I guarantee you they're gonna
Ieave her a fat tip.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.795
Women, they're so fuckin' wiIy.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.600
Oh, but poor, Amy.
She's a different story.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.636
She was D.O.A.
from the very beginning.

24:31.737 --> 24:36.003
And by extra Iemon we mean enough
for our waters and then some more.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.099
Look at the scowI
on that woman's face.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.643
- It's aII my fauIt.
- That wouId be IoveIy.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.144
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

24:41.246 --> 24:42.235
- Don't worry.
- You are too kind.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.782
She'II be Iucky to get
ten percent.

24:44.883 --> 24:46.817
I'm surprised you didn't
give those guys a Iap dance.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.854
Oh, what's that, jeaIousy?

24:49.955 --> 24:53.721
- Women troubIes, Amy?
- I just don't understand

24:53.826 --> 24:58.058
what wouId compeI a person to be
such a bitch to a totaI stranger.

24:58.163 --> 25:02.532
- Maybe she was abused as a chiId.
- Oh, God. I fucking hope so.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.400
Oh, man.
You Iook reaIIy pissed.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.438
- You reaIIy are an asshoIe.
- Shenaniganz.

25:07.539 --> 25:11.100
- Fuck you.
- He has a shy bIadder.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.906
- So is there-
- Mitch, go in the back, check out the cooks.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.675
I'II be there in
a few minutes, okay?

25:18.884 --> 25:21.648
So, what do you think
of Natasha?

25:21.754 --> 25:25.451
- I think she's iIIegaI.
- Yeah. I've made peace with that.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.958
SeriousIy, Iook at her. You know
she has that Scooby-Doo tongue.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.790
Statutory rape.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.761
On the other hand,
maybe she is too young.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.696
Like that's ever
stopped you before.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.394
That is a very,
very good point.

25:37.503 --> 25:41.837
And I'm convinced Natasha wiII be mine.
Thanks for the advice, buddy.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.170
- Hey, anytime.
- Yeah.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.904
- What's going on with you and Amy?
- What's up, Obsession?

25:47.012 --> 25:50.675
- Shut up.
- So how Iong have you two been-

25:50.783 --> 25:53.684
- Three months. Shit or get off the pot time.
- Yep.

25:53.786 --> 25:57.722
- Has even hinted that he's aware of it?
- No, he's acting obIivious.

25:57.823 --> 26:01.020
Are you gonna taIk to her or hope you're never
forced to make an actuaI decision?

26:01.126 --> 26:03.720
- I'm going with option ''B''.
- That's my boy.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.992
- Have you taIked to him about it?
- No. I'm pIaying hard to get.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.330
Oh, but haven't you sIept
with him the past five nights?

26:10.436 --> 26:12.336
WeII, not reaI hard to get.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.566
She reaIIy is a IittIe badass though.
And fun to hang out with. Laid back.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.505
Maintenance fees are reaIIy Iow.
I Iike that.

26:17.609 --> 26:22.273
Yeah, she's a cooI chick. I'd do her.
HeII, I'd probabIy even pay.

26:23.715 --> 26:25.376
I wouId.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.544
I don't know, man. I'm not even
thinking about Amy right now.

26:28.654 --> 26:31.122
- Who are you thinking about?
- Chet MiIIer.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.282
Come on, man!
You're wracked with regret

26:33.392 --> 26:36.691
just because some oId fuck-boy
cIassmate graduated coIIege?

26:38.964 --> 26:41.865
Are you gonna take
the assistant manager job?

26:41.967 --> 26:43.457
Wait. How the heII
do you know about that?

26:43.569 --> 26:45.901
Are you fucking kidding me?
You know this pIace.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.938
PeopIe with the day off
aIready know.

26:48.040 --> 26:52.602
HaIf of me is Iike take the job. I couId
reaIIy use the money. It's a smart move.

26:52.711 --> 26:56.203
But the other haIfs Iike,
''Am I fucking nuts?''

26:56.315 --> 26:59.375
Do I reaIIy wanna
end up Iike Dan?

27:00.886 --> 27:03.719
Busted.

27:07.326 --> 27:11.285
Hey, Rocco?
It's Dan down at Shenaniganz.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.387
Got another one for ya.

27:13.499 --> 27:16.024
AII right.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.727
Not on my watch.

27:17.836 --> 27:21.169
And there you go, foIks.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.571
Damn, boy. What the heII
took so Iong?

27:23.675 --> 27:26.667
WeII, you had
the two weII-done steaks,

27:26.778 --> 27:28.609
so it usuaIIy takes
a IittIe whiIe to cook.

27:28.714 --> 27:31.012
Yeah, weII, couId you
get me some more ketchup?

27:31.116 --> 27:34.051
Sure. No probIem.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.353
Nothin' sets off the fIavor
of a steak Iike some ketchup.

27:39.458 --> 27:43.258
And his mouth tasted
just Iike buttermiIk.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.887
Hey, Monty? CouId you
drop off my food, pIease?

27:45.998 --> 27:48.330
I can't deaI with
that bitch anymore.

27:50.435 --> 27:52.630
No probIem.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.467
It's go time, Mitch.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.774
Hey, there, Iadies. Amy's busy
so I thought I'd bring your food out.

28:00.879 --> 28:02.972
But I stiII have
some saIad Ieft.

28:03.148 --> 28:06.447
Oh, weII, wouId you Iike me to take the food
back and bring it out in a few minutes?

28:06.552 --> 28:08.918
Yeah, and Iet it dry out
under the heat Iamps?

28:09.021 --> 28:10.488
Just give me the food.

28:10.589 --> 28:13.217
Okay. There you go.

28:13.325 --> 28:18.957
Wait. Did that waitress
Iisten to a word I said?

28:19.064 --> 28:20.964
This steak is medium rare.

28:21.066 --> 28:26.060
I asked for it medium. And I wanted
extra gravy on my mashed potatoes.

28:26.171 --> 28:30.073
Let me ask you something.
How hard is your job?

28:30.175 --> 28:34.373
How inteIIigent do you have to be
to take a food order?

28:34.479 --> 28:35.707
- Jesus!
- Ma'am.

28:35.814 --> 28:40.217
Ma'am, you're absoIuteIy right,
and I apoIogize.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.484
I'm gonna get this fixed
for you right away.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.525
Good. Now I can
finish my saIad.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.355
Okay.

28:56.268 --> 29:01.331
GentIemen, we have our first
officiaI bee-atch of the day.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.773
Oh, come on, guys.
She wasn't that bad, was she?

29:04.876 --> 29:08.243
WeII, Amy, it's your tabIe.
You decide.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.445
She was a fucking bitch!
Do it.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.223
Yo, we need to get
some fucking hydroponics

29:19.324 --> 29:21.224
so we can grow
our own shit, yo.

29:21.326 --> 29:25.194
HeIIs, yes. Soon as we get the hydro,
we can run this city Iike the fuckin' mob.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.789
I swear, we gotta grow it, smoke it, seII it.
We'd be a fucking pimp.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.891
Yo, and you know the bitches
be Iovin' that shit.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.767
We'II get more fuckin' puss
than Busta, more than Dre,

29:33.872 --> 29:35.931
more than fuckin' Snoop Dogg.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.770
So it's on then?
We're getting the fucking hydro.

29:37.876 --> 29:40.436
We're gonna run this city
Iike the motherfucking mob.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.708
The first thing we do is add a IittIe extra gravy
to the mashed potato.

29:49.721 --> 29:53.782
Ah, that's it. Good job, buddy.
Nice one.

29:53.892 --> 29:57.384
FoIIowed by a thin spread
of cheese for your garIic bread.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.397
- Some ''fromunda'' cheese.
- Yeah, make us proud.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.629
Fresh from the taint.
We Iike this. Good.

30:04.736 --> 30:08.570
- Up next, what we're gonna do-
- How about a IittIe guacamoIe for the steak?

30:08.674 --> 30:12.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

30:12.577 --> 30:16.104
Come on, man. You can't be mixing
Mexican and ContinentaI.

30:16.214 --> 30:19.206
Come on, man.
I thought you was better than that.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.684
AII right.
How about a IittIe garIic saIt?

30:26.758 --> 30:29.625
That's what I'm taIking about.
Finesse, baby!

30:29.728 --> 30:31.855
These guys have
a deep commitment to their job.

30:31.963 --> 30:36.900
FinaIIy, a garnish
of aIfaIfa sprouts.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.492
Adds a touch of cIa-

30:41.873 --> 30:46.435
Touch of cIass to any meaI.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.705
There we go.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.680
Oh, God.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.751
Good stuff.

31:02.327 --> 31:05.160
I'II puII out my motherfuckin' shotty.

31:05.263 --> 31:06.355
PuII up Iike John Gotti.

31:06.465 --> 31:10.128
I'II have the motherfucker on the carpet.
I fucked that bitch!

31:10.235 --> 31:11.964
HeII, yeah, motherfucker.
We be down-

31:12.070 --> 31:15.506
Okay, NichoIas,
Theodore. Boys.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.575
It doesn't take ten minutes
to take out the trash.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.611
Now, if you don't get your asses out front
and start doing some work,

31:20.712 --> 31:24.011
I'm gonna fire you faster than you can say,
''Yo, MTV Raps.''

31:24.116 --> 31:25.140
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry?

31:25.250 --> 31:27.150
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.591
Hey, Rocco.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.218
Yeah, right there.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.668
Here you go, ma'am.

31:44.703 --> 31:48.070
I had the chefs take
extra speciaI care of it for you.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.232
I'm truIy sorry
for the inconvenience.

32:02.220 --> 32:05.712
You know, we shouId probabIy feeI guiIty,
but she broke the cardinaI ruIe:

32:05.824 --> 32:09.692
Don't fuck with peopIe
that handIe your food.

32:09.795 --> 32:12.389
AII right. How you guys doin'?
Everything prepared okay?

32:12.497 --> 32:15.193
CouId be better.
It'II do.

32:15.300 --> 32:18.531
I'm sorry. Is there anything
I can do to make it better?

32:18.637 --> 32:21.231
Yeah, get me an extra roII.

32:21.339 --> 32:22.738
And bring me the check.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.433
Sure.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.568
No probIem.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.976
And I'm gonna sing
that bitch a fucking 187.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.207
AII right then, CaIvin.

32:31.316 --> 32:33.784
Just reIax and start
at the beginning.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.216
Okay.

32:36.488 --> 32:42.586
About three months ago I just finished my shift,
and I reaIIy had to take a piss.

32:42.694 --> 32:47.097
So, I go into the bathroom.

32:47.199 --> 32:50.930
And I'm at the urinal,
just waiting for the flow,

32:51.036 --> 32:52.936
minding my own business.

32:53.038 --> 32:56.997
When I notice out of
my peripheral vision

32:57.108 --> 33:02.068
the guy standing next to me
was looking straight at my dick.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.978
He's just staring at it
like they're old pals.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.347
I could practically hear
what he was thinking.

33:07.452 --> 33:11.445
''Whoa. That's a nice dick. ''

33:12.624 --> 33:14.182
And that's it.

33:14.292 --> 33:17.125
Since that time, I haven't been abIe
to use a pubIic bathroom.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.696
Goodness.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.924
And the next time I tried to take a Ieak,
I couId've sworn

33:21.032 --> 33:24.001
the guy standing next to me was staring at me,
and I freaked.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.838
Quit staring at my dick!

33:29.941 --> 33:33.138
In retrospect, I think
I might've been mistaken.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.406
What about the staII?

33:35.514 --> 33:37.379
No, it didn't work either.

33:37.482 --> 33:42.886
Every time I go to take a piss, I get the image
of that guy's eyes on my shank.

33:42.988 --> 33:46.424
And then that's when
I start hearing the voices.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.958
Voices?

33:48.059 --> 33:51.153
I get this paranoid feeIing
there are peopIe outside the staII,

33:51.263 --> 33:54.357
and they know I'm having
a difficult time taking a piss.

33:54.466 --> 33:58.459
I can hear them saying,
''What's taking him so long?

33:58.570 --> 34:01.198
Why can't he just piss
Iike a normaI person?

34:01.306 --> 34:03.774
I don't hear any peel''

34:03.875 --> 34:06.002
I'm reaIIy fucked up.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.742
Psychosomatic auditory
haIIucinations.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.507
Most peopIe have to pay
for such a thing.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.051
So what the heII shouId I do?

34:15.152 --> 34:16.552
WeII, first,

34:17.556 --> 34:20.547
you need to think about how this probIem
affects other parts of your personaIity.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.524
- Oh.
- See, I recommend-

34:30.034 --> 34:31.502
Oh, bro, that ain't right, man.

34:31.603 --> 34:36.404
- Take a Iook at the bat wing, bitch!
- Oh, it's so veiny.

34:38.577 --> 34:43.310
Damn, Raddimus. Does DanieIIe know that
you Iike to go both ways? How does that work?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.572
Sweet victory.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.514
Good job, asshoIe.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.856
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

35:00.599 --> 35:04.126
HeIIo, sir. My name is Monty.
This is my trainee, Mitch.

35:04.235 --> 35:08.433
- How are you doing today?
- Oh, I'm sIipping graduaIIy into seniIity.

35:08.540 --> 35:12.738
ReaIIy? Do you consider that
a good thing or a bad thing?

35:12.844 --> 35:14.675
WeII, it's a mixed bag.

35:14.779 --> 35:20.012
It's good in the sense that
I can take waIks in my underwear.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.848
I can give smaII chiIdren
the middIe finger.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.685
But as Iong as I Iook happy
whiIe I'm doing it,

35:26.791 --> 35:29.453
peopIe just assume I'm seniIe.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.426
Yeah, so what's the bad?

35:31.529 --> 35:35.295
WeII, sometimes I give
smaII chiIdren the middIe finger

35:35.400 --> 35:39.598
and don't reaIize I'm doing it
untiI someone sIaps me.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.638
So I reaIIy am going seniIe.

35:42.741 --> 35:45.209
AIzheimer's can't be aII bad.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.437
You get a chance to meet
new peopIe every day.

35:51.016 --> 35:54.474
- I Iike you, Monty.
- I Iike you too, sir.

35:54.586 --> 35:57.146
I Iike you too, Monty.

35:57.255 --> 35:59.951
So what couId I get you
to drink?

36:00.058 --> 36:01.616
I trust you.

36:02.827 --> 36:06.319
You know what?
You can count on me, sir.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.034
I don't even care if
he gives me a poor tip,

36:11.136 --> 36:13.730
that is the cooIest oId man
I've met in my entire Iife.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.272
- How's your tabIe?
- CoupIe of hicks.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.672
- Yikes.
- Yeah, but the check totaI's $63,

36:18.777 --> 36:21.974
so even if they tip 15 percent
I shouId make 10 bucks.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.107
You're a bastard. So far I've made
15 percent of jack shit.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.147
Jesus.

36:33.558 --> 36:36.755
There you go, buddy.
It's aII you.

36:36.861 --> 36:41.298
Thanks a Iot.
We'II see you next time.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.671
How much did they Ieave you?

36:52.777 --> 36:54.870
$1.91.

36:54.979 --> 36:58.710
No fucking way.

37:08.326 --> 37:12.194
Excuse me, sir.
You forgot your change.

37:12.297 --> 37:15.391
No. That's for you.
That's your tip.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.263
Oh, no, no, no.
I insist. You take it.

37:17.368 --> 37:21.634
You obviousIy need this
more than I do.

37:21.740 --> 37:26.200
I wanna speak to your manager now, pIease.
This is horse shit.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.779
Okay, Mitch, you see what
Dean did there?

37:28.880 --> 37:30.814
Don't ever do that.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.349
- What, did he stiff you?
- He might as fucking weII have.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.715
Two bucks on a $63 check.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.720
Oh, damn.
That is pretty shitty.

37:37.822 --> 37:43.260
For insuIting me I shouId get some free
gift certificates and a key chain and a hat.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.760
AbsoIuteIy, sir. Yes.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.491
And how about a coupIe of sundaes
with some nuts on 'em?

37:47.599 --> 37:50.466
Yeah, I wiII have Natasha
take down aII your information,

37:50.568 --> 37:53.002
and I wiII make sure corporate
sends those to you.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.436
You're gonna maiI me a sundae?
I want it now.

37:55.540 --> 38:00.102
Get in here. You wanna expIain to me
what the heck you were thinking?

38:00.211 --> 38:02.236
InsuIting a customer Iike that?

38:02.347 --> 38:04.872
You're right. I know.
I know. He just-

38:04.983 --> 38:08.612
I'm having a reaIIy bad day, Dan, and that guy
caught me at the worst possibIe moment.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.382
- I'm sorry. I Iost it.
- You're sorry?

38:11.489 --> 38:14.151
I don't understand.
I've never gotten a compIaint on you.

38:14.259 --> 38:17.160
And you had to pick the day
I offer you a promotion?

38:17.262 --> 38:19.127
I promise you it won't
happen again, okay?

38:19.230 --> 38:23.496
Opportunity is knocking at the door.
If you don't wanna answer it, fine.

38:23.601 --> 38:25.432
There are peopIe who
wouId jump at the chance.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.437
CaIvin is chomping at the bit
for this job.

38:27.539 --> 38:32.033
I am offering you an opportunity to take it
to the next IeveI, earn more money.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.749
I want an answer by the end
of your shift...tonight!

38:38.850 --> 38:41.478
And Dean,
this is an expIoding offer.

38:41.586 --> 38:45.522
I don't work within
the exact boundaries of the Iaw,

38:45.623 --> 38:48.421
because I wasn't consuIted
when the goddamn Iaws were made.

38:48.526 --> 38:52.485
No, instead, nameIess,
faceIess poIiticians,

38:52.597 --> 38:57.398
the so-caIIed protectors of the moraI majority
decide what is right and what is wrong.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.470
I mean, come on!

38:59.571 --> 39:03.439
I govern my Iife around my own personaI code
of ethics, and I suggest you do the same.

39:03.541 --> 39:07.136
That way if, within the constructs
of my own moraIity

39:07.245 --> 39:10.976
I were to do something
that was considered iIIegaI, so be it.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.913
I feeI no guiIt whatsoever.

39:13.017 --> 39:17.181
And furthermore, if I were to buckIe
under the sociaI weight of the system

39:17.288 --> 39:19.381
by adhering to Iaws that
I do not truIy beIieve in,

39:19.490 --> 39:24.018
then I wouId be extinguishing the very fire
of patriotism and individuaIity.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.959
It's- It's so-

39:27.899 --> 39:29.332
In a sense,

39:30.768 --> 39:32.793
by having sex with Natasha,

39:32.904 --> 39:38.001
I'd be preserving the rights our forefathers
fought and died for, right?

39:39.110 --> 39:42.568
- WeII, I guess-
- Bro, it was a rhetoricaI question.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.307
Okay? So-

39:47.418 --> 39:52.048
Oh, hey, Dean. I heard Dan yeIIing at you.
It was kind of crazy.

39:52.156 --> 39:54.351
You think you're stiII in the running
for the assistant manager?

39:54.459 --> 39:58.190
Did you ever just wake up and reaIize,
''HoIy shit. I'm a fucking Ioser.''

39:58.296 --> 40:00.389
Yeah, man.

40:00.498 --> 40:03.626
God, I just wanna be abIe to say,
''I wanna be a teacher,'' you know,

40:03.735 --> 40:07.193
or a podiatrist or
a fucking eIectricaI engineer.

40:07.305 --> 40:09.466
Anything!
Just have a fucking cIue!

40:09.574 --> 40:11.439
Hey, who has a cIue, right?

40:11.542 --> 40:15.842
Hey, I don't. HeIIo?
I don't know what's going on.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.642
Hey, couId you put down
the ice pick?

40:17.749 --> 40:21.742
- Sorry you had to hear that guy yeII.
- Oh, it's okay.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.821
You shouIdn't have to be
subjected to that.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.152
You're way too sweet.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.784
- Way too cute, too.
- Stop it. You're gonna make me bIush.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.520
Bet you drive the boys wiId
at your schooI.

40:33.631 --> 40:36.361
Maybe. I don't reaIIy Iike
the boys at my schooI.

40:36.467 --> 40:38.901
No? Why?

40:39.003 --> 40:41.062
I prefer oIder men.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.197
ReaIIy? Wow.

40:43.308 --> 40:45.469
I Iike a man in power.

40:45.576 --> 40:49.740
Yeah, weII, being a manager,
obviousIy, I know what you mean.

40:49.847 --> 40:53.339
It takes a Iot of power to command the respect
of everybody at the restaurant.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.510
- That's true.
- Yeah.

40:55.620 --> 41:01.115
We shouId go to dinner sometime
and taIk about it.

41:01.225 --> 41:04.023
I'II bring my manager card,
and we'II just eat for free.

41:04.128 --> 41:08.963
As they say,
membership has its priviIeges.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.430
What's up with you?
What are you stiII doing here?

41:11.536 --> 41:14.130
Christy asked me to work for her,
so I'm working a doubIe.

41:14.238 --> 41:17.230
Time-out. Isn't this
your onIy night off this week?

41:17.342 --> 41:18.331
Yeah.

41:18.443 --> 41:22.641
And you're using it to work
a doubIe-shift for Christy?

41:22.747 --> 41:25.648
Wait. You actuaIIy have to get the pussy
before you can be whipped by it.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.411
- That's right.
- You guys suck.

41:27.518 --> 41:31.113
- Yes, we do.
- Wait. Didn't you take out Christy Iast night?

41:31.222 --> 41:33.486
- Yeah, we went out Iast night.
- Come on, man! DetaiIs!

41:33.591 --> 41:37.288
Fuck the detaiIs. I wanna know.
Did you do it? Did you make a move?

41:37.395 --> 41:39.761
- What do you mean?
- Don't give me that shit. You know.

41:39.864 --> 41:42.355
- Did you kiss her? Rub against her skin?
- CuddIe with her? Rub her Ieg?

41:42.467 --> 41:45.368
- HoId her hand?
- NippIe tweak? Anything?

41:45.470 --> 41:47.461
- No, I'm stiII-
- Oh, my God!

41:47.572 --> 41:48.504
I need more time.

41:48.606 --> 41:51.404
- Forget it. It's over. You're fucked.
- Not IiteraIIy.

41:51.509 --> 41:55.070
- Why? Because you won't puII the trigger.
- And you're too fucking nice!

41:55.179 --> 41:56.806
Why do you aIways say that?
I'm not-

41:56.914 --> 41:59.178
- What happens with every girI you Iike?
- Nothing!

41:59.283 --> 42:02.343
You take 'em out, you pay for everything,
and you never make a move!

42:02.453 --> 42:06.389
Then you home, aIone, to masturbate
whiIe you cry, using your own tears-

42:06.491 --> 42:11.224
That was once, and I was drunk
and it was VaIentine's day. So back off.

42:11.329 --> 42:15.197
Don't try to candy coat it.
AII we ever do is hang out and have sex.

42:15.299 --> 42:19.895
What are you taIking about? Didn't I take you
to the movies Iast week, huh? Huh?

42:20.004 --> 42:22.666
Yeah, but you kept trying
to get me to jerk you off.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.368
What do you want?
It was a duII movie.

42:27.478 --> 42:32.211
Yeah, but I just get the feeIing
that you don't care.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.685
I don't care?
I don't care?

42:36.721 --> 42:40.953
When my uncIe died, didn't I ask
you to be by my side at the funeraI?

42:41.059 --> 42:44.893
Yeah, but you kept trying
to get me to jerk you off.

42:47.832 --> 42:50.164
How many times can we have
the same exact conversation?

42:50.268 --> 42:52.463
It's Iike we're stuck
in a time paradox

42:52.570 --> 42:55.038
where neither our wisdom nor your virginity
wiII ever escape.

42:55.139 --> 42:58.108
I attempt to make a move.

42:58.209 --> 43:01.610
I get in cIose.
I'm there and I just get-

43:01.712 --> 43:02.838
Fuck!

43:02.947 --> 43:06.542
- You need therapy.
- Hush, now.

43:06.651 --> 43:09.484
The way I see it, with chicks,

43:09.587 --> 43:12.317
there's reaIIy onIy two possibIe things
that couId happen.

43:12.423 --> 43:16.484
Either they won't sIeep with you,
and then there's no need to caII them again,

43:16.594 --> 43:20.655
or they do sIeep with you, and then
there's no need to caII them again.

43:20.765 --> 43:24.792
This is what I don't get. How can someone
be such a compIete asshoIe aII the time

43:24.902 --> 43:26.802
and get as many women
as you do?

43:26.904 --> 43:29.338
That's a good question.

43:30.508 --> 43:33.569
- Amy! Serena! CaIvin needs our heIp.
- No.

43:33.678 --> 43:35.805
- No, I don't need heIp.
- Shh, shh.

43:35.913 --> 43:37.813
Women Iike asshoIes,
am I right?

43:37.915 --> 43:40.907
- WeII, I agree that you're an asshoIe.
- Okay.

43:41.018 --> 43:45.182
''A'', fuck you.
''B'', just answer the question.

43:45.289 --> 43:49.157
WeII, okay. GirIs Iike asshoIes,
not women.

43:49.260 --> 43:52.286
What women are attracted to
is seIf-confidence.

43:52.396 --> 43:55.263
Yes, and we absoIuteIy
fucking hate insecurity.

43:55.366 --> 43:57.630
Yes! The more insecure you are
the more you ask, ''Is something wrong?''

43:57.735 --> 43:59.566
- ''Is everything okay?''
- ''What are you thinking about?''

43:59.670 --> 44:02.070
''What's wrong?''
And the more you do that, CaIvin,

44:02.173 --> 44:04.664
the more it becomes
this seIf-fuIfiIIing prophecy.

44:04.775 --> 44:08.438
You just need to reIax
and not worry so much. Okay?

44:11.682 --> 44:14.515
Yeah. That makes
a Iot of sense.

44:14.619 --> 44:17.850
- I'm gonna work on it.
- Yeah. Yeah, you do that.

44:17.955 --> 44:22.324
And by the way, take whatever advice
that she gives you with a big grain of saIt.

44:22.426 --> 44:25.122
Yeah, and take anything that he gives you
with a shot of peniciIIin.

44:25.229 --> 44:28.426
SeriousIy, CaIvin,
do yourseIf a favor.

44:28.533 --> 44:31.161
UnIess you're combing the pIayground
for middIe schooIers,

44:31.269 --> 44:34.432
don't become an asshoIe
Iike Monty.

44:34.539 --> 44:38.270
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but haven't I been inside you?

44:46.651 --> 44:48.585
- Oh, Monty.
- Oh, me.

44:48.686 --> 44:52.486
You wanna brag about your sexuaI conquests,
you big stud, you?

44:52.590 --> 44:55.320
Okay, you know what? Fine.
Let's taIk about it.

44:55.426 --> 44:59.123
Let me describe Monty's
amazing sexuaI prowess.

44:59.230 --> 45:03.326
He'd barreI into me with that pathetic excuse
for a chiId's penis.

45:03.434 --> 45:07.495
And it wouId end so quickIy,
so abruptIy,

45:07.605 --> 45:10.073
I wouIdn't even have time
to feeI any sort of

45:10.174 --> 45:13.803
morbid, accidentaI amusement
towards his ''technique,''

45:13.911 --> 45:16.141
which was basicaIIy him
seizuring on top of me

45:16.247 --> 45:18.613
for, oh, about 45 seconds,

45:18.716 --> 45:22.345
whiIe I Iaid there trying
not to Iaugh...or cry.

45:22.453 --> 45:23.511
Ouch.

45:23.621 --> 45:26.784
Is it any wonder why you stiII date girIs
in high schooI?

45:26.891 --> 45:29.382
They're the onIy ones Ieft.
They don't know any better.

45:29.493 --> 45:31.723
Okay, okay. AII right.

45:31.829 --> 45:34.059
First of aII, for the record,

45:34.165 --> 45:37.259
I aIways had an orgasm
when we had sex.

45:37.368 --> 45:40.030
SecondIy, everybody knows
that I'm oraIIy fixated.

45:40.137 --> 45:42.765
You can't deny that I pIayed your vagina
Iike a vioIin.

45:42.873 --> 45:47.606
Oh! As if that somehow negates the fact
that once we got past forepIay,

45:47.712 --> 45:50.306
you turned into the IittIe engine
that couIdn't hoId his Ioad.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.541
Oh, what the fuck ever!

45:52.650 --> 45:55.744
If I was that bad, then why were
you at my house every night?

45:55.853 --> 45:58.651
AII I had to do was caII
and say, ''Hey. I'm horny.''

45:58.756 --> 46:00.724
And then fucking poof!

46:00.825 --> 46:04.420
As if by some form of sIut magic
you'd appear. Now why is that?

46:04.528 --> 46:07.554
Because at first, I reaIIy
Iiked spending time with you.

46:07.665 --> 46:10.225
I thought you were a genuineIy
interesting guy to be around.

46:10.334 --> 46:11.301
Very true.

46:11.402 --> 46:14.701
But eventuaIIy, it aII wore thin.
I reaIized that your personaIity

46:14.805 --> 46:17.365
was just one short punctuated
joke after another,

46:17.475 --> 46:19.534
much Iike our sex Iife.

46:19.644 --> 46:23.478
And, oh, Monty, do you remember
why we stopped dating?

46:23.581 --> 46:26.812
Yeah, I do.
Because you were oId news.

46:26.917 --> 46:30.910
I was Iooking at other girIs and getting bored.
BasicaIIy, that was why.

46:31.022 --> 46:33.115
Yeah, yeah. AII that.

46:33.224 --> 46:34.714
And the fact that I dumped you.

46:34.825 --> 46:37.385
- Wait, I thought you said you dumped-
- Shut up, CaIvin.

46:37.495 --> 46:40.225
I was just trying to Iet you down easy,
but this is buIIshit.

46:40.398 --> 46:43.697
We both know that you enjoyed
having sex with me.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.634
The onIy reaI pIeasure I ever got
from having sex with you

46:46.737 --> 46:48.500
came from making fun of it
Iater with my friends.

46:48.606 --> 46:51.666
- TeII him, Amy.
- It's true. We Iaughed a Iot at your expense.

46:51.776 --> 46:56.110
So you know when you're waIking past
a group of peopIe, you hear them Iaughing,

46:56.213 --> 46:59.341
you sometimes get that paranoid
seIf-conscious feeIing?

46:59.450 --> 47:02.419
Maybe they're Iaughing about you
when they're reaIIy not?

47:02.520 --> 47:05.751
WeII, in your case,
they reaIIy are.

47:21.505 --> 47:24.372
God, I Iove her.

47:26.043 --> 47:27.601
Oh, hello there.

47:27.712 --> 47:30.613
Thank you for joining our family
at Shenaniganz bar and grill.

47:30.715 --> 47:33.479
It is our goal to maintain the absolute
highest standard in all aspects-

47:33.584 --> 47:36.951
Hey, man.
We aII had to watch it.

47:37.054 --> 47:40.615
I'm gonna come back and get you after
the dinner rush. The tape shouId be done then.

47:40.725 --> 47:41.749
CooI?

47:43.661 --> 47:45.424
WeII, I mean, I guess. I-

47:45.529 --> 47:47.258
...of our most sacred
company policies

47:47.365 --> 47:49.833
to ensure that you have
all the skills necessary

47:49.934 --> 47:53.392
- to uphold our standard of excellence.
- Shit.

47:53.504 --> 47:57.304
Are you ready? Well, okay.
Follow me.

47:57.408 --> 47:59.672
AII right, men.
This is it.

47:59.777 --> 48:03.907
The time has come. Remember,
product pride. Portion consciousness.

48:04.014 --> 48:06.482
Zero hour is upon us.

48:06.584 --> 48:09.144
Let us seize the day!

48:09.253 --> 48:11.551
Yeah, yeah!
Carpe deez nuts.

48:11.655 --> 48:13.714
God, I can't wait to quit
this job!

48:25.102 --> 48:26.933
Okay, your waiter
wiII be right with you.

48:27.037 --> 48:28.595
Hi there, foIks.
What can I get you to drink?

48:28.706 --> 48:30.435
WouId you Iike to start
with an appetizer?

48:30.541 --> 48:32.941
WouId you Iike a baked potato,
french fries or rice piIaf?

48:33.043 --> 48:35.511
- Order up!
- Is everything prepared okay?

48:35.613 --> 48:38.047
- How about some dessert?
- And here you go, foIks.

48:38.149 --> 48:40.879
I hope you enjoyed everything.
I know I did.

48:50.594 --> 48:53.927
- Fuck!
- The five-second ruIe! The five-second ruIe!

48:54.031 --> 48:55.896
One, two, three,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.696
four, five.

49:00.538 --> 49:04.474
A IittIe fIoor spice makes everything nice.
There you go.

49:05.509 --> 49:08.603
Damn, man. We aImost had to switch
to the ten-second ruIe.

49:11.215 --> 49:13.649
You green
snot-beard faggot!

49:20.858 --> 49:22.052
Fuck you!

49:22.159 --> 49:25.686
- Oh, no.
- Hang on. I onIy have a smaII order.

49:25.796 --> 49:28.492
- I have to put in an appetizer. Goddamn it.
- ChiII the fuck out!

49:28.599 --> 49:30.567
WeII, hurry up.

49:32.870 --> 49:34.929
Okay, hey, gang.
Listen up.

49:35.039 --> 49:36.666
Let's get out there,
take care of our guests.

49:36.774 --> 49:39.174
I know it's getting crazy,
but we can do it. We can do it.

49:39.276 --> 49:42.074
Let's put that extra- just that IittIe extra-
back in extraordinary.

49:42.179 --> 49:45.205
Okay. There's no
''me'' in ''team.''

49:46.217 --> 49:47.206
Yeah.

49:48.352 --> 49:50.183
Hey, guys. Which one of these
is medium rare?

49:55.025 --> 49:56.959
Shoot. Let's just-

49:59.029 --> 50:01.793
Goddamn it!

50:01.899 --> 50:04.925
PIease.

50:05.035 --> 50:08.493
Let me do it.

50:08.606 --> 50:10.437
AII right, you two, Iet's go.

50:10.541 --> 50:13.908
Hurry up, or your asses
are fired!

50:16.180 --> 50:19.638
So remember, find the solution
before there's a problem.

50:19.750 --> 50:23.277
Now let's go take a look at our problem
back in the kitchen.

50:24.755 --> 50:26.780
Come on, guys.
This is buII crap.

50:26.891 --> 50:29.451
Where the heII's
my chicken sandwich?

50:31.228 --> 50:33.059
Fuck you, bitch!

50:33.163 --> 50:34.858
What the heII
did I do to you, FIoyd?

50:34.965 --> 50:38.423
Eat at Shenaniganz
enjoy your food

50:38.536 --> 50:42.472
Eat at Shenaniganz
Calvin works here

50:42.573 --> 50:44.165
Okay, that's hardIy sanitary.

50:44.275 --> 50:47.676
Hey, Dan. I have a tabIe
that needs to-

51:13.604 --> 51:18.234
Trying to get a feeI for the whoIe
manager thing. You caught me.

51:18.342 --> 51:21.800
Do you think you couId get a feeI for it outside?
I need some fresh air.

51:24.415 --> 51:27.077
Hey, hey, Christy.
It's CaIvin again. I-

51:28.886 --> 51:32.151
Just caIIing again.
Just checking in or whatever.

51:32.256 --> 51:35.282
CaIIed before a few times.
Maybe you didn't-

51:35.392 --> 51:36.791
I got aII my bars.

51:36.894 --> 51:39.055
So anyway, it's getting
kind of busy.

51:39.163 --> 51:41.859
But I'm never too busy
to caII you.

51:41.966 --> 51:46.460
So caII me back. You know the number.
Okay. Bye.

51:46.570 --> 51:47.867
Fuck.

51:49.406 --> 51:52.898
So is everything okay?
Is something wrong?

51:54.979 --> 51:56.412
Are you mad?

52:00.484 --> 52:02.111
Yeah?

52:02.219 --> 52:06.280
Somethin' bad happens
when you become a manager.

52:06.390 --> 52:10.554
You put on your fuckin' tie, and you get
your fuckin' IittIe manager card,

52:10.661 --> 52:13.061
and you're think you're so fuckin' cooI
because you write the scheduIe

52:13.163 --> 52:14.824
and teII us what to do.

52:14.932 --> 52:17.924
When in reaIity, you know you're not even
worth a bit of buIIshit!

52:18.035 --> 52:19.969
Whoa, Naomi!

52:20.070 --> 52:22.095
ReIax.

52:22.206 --> 52:25.539
ReIax, woman.

52:25.643 --> 52:30.410
I guess if you become manager, you won't
be abIe to date any of the waitresses.

52:30.681 --> 52:34.082
While working here, you'll probably find some
of your fellow employees attractive.

52:34.184 --> 52:38.245
It's okay. There's nothing
wrong with that.

52:38.355 --> 52:41.051
But it's important
not to act on those urges.

52:41.158 --> 52:44.559
For Shenaniganz to run like an efficient,
well-oiled machine,

52:44.662 --> 52:48.098
it's a must that
everyone act as a team.

52:48.198 --> 52:51.964
And when employees date each other,
unfortunately, it complicates things.

52:52.069 --> 52:53.400
So for that reason

52:53.504 --> 52:57.270
we strongly discourage
such relationships from forming.

52:57.374 --> 53:00.400
- Dean, Amy, I just sat you.
- Oh, shit. What do we got?

53:00.511 --> 53:03.605
WeII, yours are cooI.
They Iook Iike business peopIe.

53:03.714 --> 53:05.705
- AII right.
- What about mine?

53:05.816 --> 53:08.011
I don't know.
They don't speak EngIish.

53:08.118 --> 53:09.676
- Foreigners!
- I'm sorry.

53:09.787 --> 53:14.486
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I swear. I'm just going by the rotation.

53:14.591 --> 53:19.893
I fuckin' hate foreigners!
It's such buIIshit!

53:19.997 --> 53:21.658
Like they don't know how to tip?
Oh, they know.

53:21.765 --> 53:23.756
Aw, yeah, they fuckin' know.

53:23.867 --> 53:28.133
AII right.
It's time to show the goat.

53:33.177 --> 53:35.805
You could cut through shoes
if you had to.

53:35.913 --> 53:39.440
- I mean-
- What are you doing, man?

53:39.550 --> 53:41.643
FrontIine stuff. Watch this.
Watch this.

53:41.752 --> 53:44.414
We have just been cutting things
90 to nothing.

53:44.521 --> 53:47.149
And the cooks, they just
love it because every time-

53:49.893 --> 53:53.761
Hey, there, foIks. My name is Amy,
and I'II be taking care of you.

53:58.702 --> 54:01.967
- Sir, what can I get for you?
- I'd Iike a New York strip, mid rare,

54:02.072 --> 54:04.939
and a baked potato with
sour cream and chives onIy.

54:05.042 --> 54:08.011
And- Hey. You're not
writing any of this down.

54:08.112 --> 54:11.775
Oh. SteeI-trap.

54:11.882 --> 54:13.816
You got the baby back ribs
with fries,

54:13.917 --> 54:17.216
you got the Mandingo chicken with rice
and a saIad with a side of bIue cheese.

54:17.321 --> 54:19.789
I respect
the Iactose intoIerance.

54:19.890 --> 54:22.051
Okay. Okay, you're good.

54:27.831 --> 54:32.393
HaIey is so fuckin' fine, you know I be aII up
in that shit. Give her the bowIing baII grip.

54:32.503 --> 54:35.995
Two in the pink,
one in the stink.

54:40.444 --> 54:43.607
You guys are so one-dimensionaI.

54:45.783 --> 54:47.580
WeII, fuck you, whitey.

54:48.886 --> 54:52.652
I just sat you.
You're gonna Iove them.

55:02.065 --> 55:05.296
Hey, there, Iadies.
My name is Monty.

55:17.548 --> 55:20.540
Hey, FIoyd, make sure there's no bacon
on that chef saIad. It's against her reIigion.

55:20.651 --> 55:23.245
- AII right?
- Yes, master. Right away, master.

55:23.353 --> 55:25.548
Ain't gonna be no bacon
on the saIad, master.

55:25.656 --> 55:30.093
No bacon. Oh, no, no.
Oh, no, no. PIease. Oh.

55:30.194 --> 55:32.628
Oh, no.

55:32.729 --> 55:35.061
No bacon on the salad

55:42.606 --> 55:47.475
So, is there anything eIse
I can get you foIks this evening?

55:47.578 --> 55:50.945
I think I'd Iike
a hot fudge sundae.

55:54.818 --> 55:58.219
That does sound good.
I'II be right back with that for you.

56:00.524 --> 56:04.358
Like that bitch needs to be
eating dessert anyway.

56:07.064 --> 56:11.023
You know, if you ever want counseIing
in anger management or...

56:12.703 --> 56:17.731
aIcohoIism, I'd be more
than gIad to do it for you.

56:20.210 --> 56:22.303
You'd do that for me?

56:25.983 --> 56:29.419
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

56:29.519 --> 56:33.455
But I think I'd rather you just
wash the fucking dishes

56:33.557 --> 56:36.048
and shut the fuck up!

56:36.159 --> 56:40.789
Fucking psychobabbIe-buIIshit
asshoIe!

56:42.165 --> 56:45.498
Fuckin' bitch.
Son of a bitch, cocksucker.

56:45.602 --> 56:48.628
Fuckin', I hate her.
I hate her!

57:03.053 --> 57:05.544
Fuckin' Nick and T-dog!

57:18.302 --> 57:23.001
That is why we are always on guard
for guests. You never know when-

57:23.106 --> 57:27.202
- Shit.
- So you have to make sure they-

57:28.245 --> 57:30.873
Fuck! Man, no!

57:31.081 --> 57:34.278
If we're gonna beat Iast year's numbers,
I need you to be more hands-on.

57:34.384 --> 57:37.251
I need you to be sure things
don't faII through the cracks.

57:37.354 --> 57:39.982
BasicaIIy, I need you
to be more Iike Dean here.

57:40.090 --> 57:43.651
I question whether you can
see that by me serving food,

57:43.760 --> 57:46.251
but thank you anyway.

57:46.363 --> 57:49.355
- How is everything, guys?
- Everything's perfect.

57:49.466 --> 57:50.763
You're a master of your craft.

57:50.867 --> 57:52.960
Thanks.

57:53.070 --> 57:55.868
You keep this up, I may just try
to Iure you away from this pIace.

57:57.374 --> 57:59.433
AII right.
WeII, thank you, sir.

57:59.543 --> 58:02.671
Let me know if
you need anything, guys.

58:02.779 --> 58:07.045
You're probably wondering what makes
Shenaniganz such a great restaurant.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.914
So I thought I'd share with you
a few key examples

58:10.020 --> 58:12.318
of why we've had so much success.

58:13.123 --> 58:16.422
First of all,
our entrées are always cooked

58:16.526 --> 58:18.994
exquisitely to perfection.

58:19.096 --> 58:22.293
Our deserts were designed
by gourmet chefs.

58:22.399 --> 58:25.562
We always treat our guests
with respect and dignity.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.261
Did you see the tits
on tabIe 12?

58:27.371 --> 58:29.896
We treat each other
with respect and dignity.

58:30.007 --> 58:31.474
Fuckin'-ass pervert!

58:31.575 --> 58:36.342
Remember, the difference between ordinary
and extraordinary

58:36.446 --> 58:38.277
is that little extra.

58:38.382 --> 58:43.445
The penis just Iooks ridicuIous.
It's Iike a shriveIed roII of dimes or something.

58:43.553 --> 58:45.248
I know. It's a joke.

58:45.355 --> 58:47.289
- She's in Iove.
- Hey, TyIa.

58:47.391 --> 58:50.383
You gonna taIk to your girIfriend aII night
or make my drink?

58:59.903 --> 59:03.168
That's okay.
I understand how it works.

59:03.273 --> 59:06.970
Birds of a feather
fIock to vagina.

59:15.752 --> 59:18.312
Get off your ass and get heIp!

59:18.422 --> 59:20.049
You want some heIp, bitch?

59:23.627 --> 59:25.618
Here you go.

59:28.331 --> 59:30.822
Theodore! What the heck
are you doing?

59:30.934 --> 59:34.631
How many times I toId you?
My name is T-dog, bitch!

59:34.738 --> 59:39.175
My name is T-dog, bitch!
My name is T-dog, bitch!

59:40.243 --> 59:44.942
Hey, sweetie. It's aImost 9:00.
I just came to say good-bye.

59:46.783 --> 59:48.273
Hey, baby.

59:48.385 --> 59:51.354
You wanna go in the car
and have a IittIe sex?

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:05.691
So what if there's pIenty of parking spaces?
It's the principIe of the matter.

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:08.532
Hey, you're preaching to the choir here.
Know what I mean?

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:12.130
The Iord giveth, the Iord taketh away.

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.504
Damn, come on.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.042
What the fuck?

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.680
Here you go, sir. Once again,
I hope you enjoyed everything.

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:26.983
- Thanks.
- See you guys.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.615
Dean, I wanna teII you,
you did an extraordinary job.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.250
Oh, thank you, sir.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.625
- How oId are you?
- I'm 22.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.426
WeII, you're obviousIy
a very inteIIigent young man.

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:38.967
Let me give you my card.

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:41.629
Ever get tired of this pIace,
you're Iooking for a new opportunity,

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.968
- you give me a caII.
- AII right.

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:46.372
Thank you, sir.
I honestIy appreciate that.

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:49.343
Great. AII right.
Have a good night, guys.

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.243
Thanks again. Thank you.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.311
WeII, I hope he caIIs.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.899
Mama said they's my magic shoes.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.833
Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:17.168
Of course, Mama used to beat me
with a rubber hose, caII me a retard.

01:01:17.274 --> 01:01:20.175
Dude, pIease stop.
Stop. Okay?

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:23.269
I appreciate what
you're trying to do. I do.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:27.316
But, dude, I'm reaIIy not in the mood
for smiIing, aII right?

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:28.577
Okay.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.949
- What?
- The oId Iady at tabIe 37 wants you to sing

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.612
the birthday song
for her grandson.

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:35.850
His name is Timmy,
and he's eight years old.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.019
I need birthday singers!

01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:42.724
- Come on, peopIe! We need birthday singers!
- Fuck.

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:51.163
There he is.
There's the big winner.

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:53.834
- Yeah!
- Hey.

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:56.208
AII right. Attention, guests!

01:01:56.313 --> 01:02:01.512
Today's a very speciaI occasion.
It's Timmy's eighth birthday!

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:05.179
Big round of appIause.
He's earned it.

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.722
He's got his whoIe Iife ahead of him.
The sky's the Iimit.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:10.088
I don't know but I've been told

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:11.990
Someone here is getting old

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:14.063
Good news is dessert is free

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:16.029
Bad news is we sing off-key

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.997
Happy birthday

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.625
To you

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:28.870
- Look at the camera!
- Picture time.

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:33.772
- AII right. AII right.
- Cry it off.

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:36.317
WeII, we can't go
in the parking Iot.

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:39.788
Can't go anywhere
in the kitchen.

01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:43.818
WeII, maybe we couId-

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:46.327
We are not having sex
in the bathroom.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.522
- But-
- No. No way. Forget it.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:55.199
Oh. Come on, baby.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.037
Come on.

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.070
Okay.

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:07.646
- Okay, but this is the Iast time.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.819
So where do you girIs
go to coIIege?

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.490
ActuaIIy, we're stiII
in high schooI.

01:03:15.592 --> 01:03:18.755
You're kidding.
How oId are you girIs?

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:20.557
Sixteen.

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:22.427
Wow.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:28.368
You Iook a Iot oIder than that.
I wouId've guessed 19, 20, maybe 21.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.268
Yeah, we get that a Iot.

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.943
Here. Let me give you
a hand with that.

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:38.514
It's the stupid chiIdproof Iighters.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:44.378
Hey, Bishop. Can I taIk
to you about something?

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.045
Yeah, sure. Have a seat.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.714
Thanks.

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:54.124
AII right, so I went
to my mother's this morning.

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:56.596
You've been working here, what?
About a year and four months, right?

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.533
Yeah, I guess. About.

01:03:59.636 --> 01:04:03.834
- But anyway, we have a good reIationship-
- About three years ago,

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.137
this restaurant went through
quite a Iow point.

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:10.644
Okay, I'm sorry. Did you wanna hear
what I was gonna say or-

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:14.581
PIease. See, the store moraIe
was beginning to sIip.

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:17.209
CIienteIe base began
dropping off.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.447
That of course, Ied to Iower tips,
which in time,

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:21.524
Ied to an even Iower
store moraIe.

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:26.254
BasicaIIy, the entire restaurant was going
through quite a downward spiraI.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:28.422
Okay.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.694
Then Raddimus began
working here.

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:35.635
And with him came the penis-showin' game
you aII Iike to pIay.

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:40.108
Okay, I- Why are you
teIIing me this?

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.474
Restaurant began to improve.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:47.141
EmpIoyees started having more fun at work.
They started joking around a Iot more,

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.344
which Ied to a raise in the cIienteIe base,
higher tips

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.080
and so on and so forth.

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:56.249
Yeah, I stiII don't understand, Bishop.

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.054
Point is,

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:02.494
the penis-showin' game
became a cataIyst

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:05.568
for the change necessary
to be made in the restaurant.

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:12.101
So, when things in your Iife
become stagnant.

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:16.338
You know, you're no Ionger happy
with what you're doing.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:19.813
Then you figure out
what's important to you.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:24.353
Then create your own
penis-showin' game.

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:27.820
MetaphoricaIIy speaking,
that is.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:33.260
Okay. Okay, thanks, Bishop.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:41.570
So do you think taking the assistant manager
job wouId be Iike my penis-showing game?

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.571
Is that what you're saying?

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.638
Okay.

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:52.377
Where the heII is it?
It's been over haIf an hour!

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:54.882
ToId you it'd be up in a minute!
Get out of my face or I'II Iose your ticket!

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:58.385
What? What do you want?
Get back to the training room, you ass cock!

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:02.219
Goddamn it! I hate these fuckin' cooks.
I hate them!

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:04.953
Twenty minutes for two medium-rare steaks?
This is buIIshit.

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:09.464
What the heII? They need to get rid of every
singIe one of these Iousy cocksucking mother-

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:12.228
So how is everything?

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:17.730
Give me a caII
when you get this.

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:20.867
Can you bring this to tabIe 75?
I gotta try to take a piss.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.504
- Okay, good Iuck.
- Thanks.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:28.050
Okay, so how wouId you Iike
your steak prepared?

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:31.678
Oh, Iet's see.
Medium, medium-rare.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:35.280
WeII, I want a hot, pink center.

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.188
Don't we aII?

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:42.092
AII right. Do you know
what you guys want?

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:45.690
- I'd Iike a tossed saIad, pIease.
- Oh, you're bad.

01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:47.861
Yo, girI, give me
the instant camera.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:51.407
Yo, there's a birthday party in the kitchen.
We're gonna take a picture.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.136
Bus tabIe 73 first,
and then I'II give you the camera.

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:56.542
Yeah, whatever.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:58.841
Ma'am, I don't doubt
the steak was overcooked,

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.610
but did you have to eat it aII
before you compIained about it?

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:05.245
It's too bad chIamydia has to be a venereaI
disease. It's such a pIeasant-sounding word.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.118
- ChIamydia?
- ChIamydia.

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:10.488
ChIamydia. I think I might
name my daughter ChIamydia.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:14.757
Okay, he wanted the jumbo shrimp
with baked potato, and she wanted the-

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.729
Fuck. What did she order?

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:18.198
- I can't.
- Hothead.

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:23.765
Hi. Here's your change.
I hope you guys have a reaIIy nice evening.

01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:44.859
- Fuck.
- Hurry up. Come on.

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:46.360
What's taking so Iong?

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.191
Shh. I'm trying to concentrate.

01:07:48.298 --> 01:07:49.993
Somebody here?

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:51.532
Hurry up.

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:53.033
This is crazy.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:54.467
Shh, shh, shh.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.095
No, no. Stop. Stop.

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:59.436
- Here we go.
- Oh, God!

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.815
- My fuckin' man! Yeah, man!
- You Iike that?

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.009
Yo, give me the fucking picture back.

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:40.473
So, what are you doing tonight?

01:08:40.582 --> 01:08:42.915
Oh, I'm sure I'II end up
at the party.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.747
Oh, yeah?

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:51.019
Do you-

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.429
Do you think I-

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:58.055
- You wanna come to the party?
- WeII, yeah.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:02.263
Those guys, they aIways seem to forget
to teII me where it's at.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:06.103
Okay. As soon as
I find out where it is,

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:09.234
I'II make sure
to give you directions.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:14.840
WeII, then. Tonight shouId be a good night
for both of us, huh?

01:09:20.288 --> 01:09:22.256
OnIy 30 more minutes
to go, man.

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:25.555
We better not have no Iate-night asshoIe
comin' in here.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.425
So how'd y'aII do tonight?

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:31.125
- I made about 70.
- 86.

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:33.862
I made 67 on a doubIe.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.461
Oh, God.
How pissed are you?

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:38.971
- How much did you make?
- A biII.

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:43.535
I never make- How do you make
a hundred doIIars every night?

01:09:43.645 --> 01:09:44.977
- You wanna know?
- Yeah.

01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:47.948
You reaIIy wanna know how I make
a hundred doIIars every night?

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:50.952
- Yes.
- It's aII about that right there.

01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:54.849
Yes!

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:56.447
Yes!

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.322
Monty with the assist!

01:09:58.428 --> 01:10:00.589
I can't beIieve how many homos
we got working in here.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.928
It's crazy.
Mitch, cherry-popping time.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.002
Okay, Monty, my bitch.
Kick me a fieId goaI.

01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:08.832
You know what?
I don't understand.

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:12.704
You pIot and you scheme on how to
get the other person to Iook at your goat

01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:14.640
or chicken wing or whatever.

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:17.679
And then when he Iooks,
you caII him a fag.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.682
It's Iike it's an exercise
in retarded homophobic futiIity.

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:23.479
You know you girIs Iove it.

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:27.545
So, seriousIy, Iadies,
why don't you wanna pIay the game?

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:29.818
I reaIIy think that we'd be wiIIing
to amend the ruIes for you.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:33.327
- Oh, yeah. I bet you wouId.
- No girI wouId ever pIay that game.

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:34.487
Why not?

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.155
- You wanna know why?
- Yeah.

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:38.495
- You reaIIy wanna know why?
- I reaIIy do.

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:41.661
Okay. I'II teII you why.

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:44.331
- It's because of this!
- Oh!

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.000
Oh, yeah. Bang.
Pow! Pow! Pow!

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.975
It's so angry!

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:52.406
Oh, God.
Does that thing have its shots?

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:56.645
- Put it away. Put it away.
- Dinner is served!

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:58.681
Oh, my God.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:02.781
WeII, it's officiaI.
Now my penis is just for show.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:05.588
Mitch, you picked a fucked-up night
to start working here.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.128
- Oh, my God.
- Bend over, boys.

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:11.166
Oh, it's Iadies' time.

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:16.797
- Spread 'em. Let's go.
- AII right. That's enough.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:21.268
You Ioved it.

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.902
- Mitch, you're coming to the party tonight?
- WeII, yeah-

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:25.503
Great. Let's get
this party started then.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.845
I gotta stop home first.
I'II meet you there.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.111
Why do you have to go home?

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:32.881
Oh. Right. Sorry, CaIvin.

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:36.653
Okay, baby doII,

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:39.284
If you do everything right,

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:43.126
Oh, God, Natasha, you're gonna have
to stop that. You're making it hard.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:44.790
I mean, difficuIt.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:47.267
Hey, Cochise, we're out.
I'II see you, okay?

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.032
Yeah. I'II see you there.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:52.972
Okay, I am so ready

OnIy three more minutes

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:02.942
Come on.

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:10.325
- Oh, hi there.

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:13.359
- Not quite.

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:18.828
- Great.

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:20.994
And Dean wiII be

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:23.367
Awesome.

Hey, there, foIks. My name is Dean.

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:32.744
HeIIo, Dean.

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:38.782
Hey, Chet.

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:42.557
I'm sorry, guys.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:51.758
Why? Why? Why? Why?

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.564
Okay, so I'II go ahead

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.695

01:12:56.806 --> 01:13:00.606
- Yeah, sounds good.

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:08.573
Oops. How cIumsy of me.

Oh, man, Iook what I did.

Yeah, yeah.

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:37.870
Anyway. Yeah. I just started my new career.
They're starting me off at 48,000 a year.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.914
Wow. Wow.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:42.883
Yeah, I've been Iooking at houses.
It's reaIIy exciting.

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.179

01:13:44.287 --> 01:13:47.313
- So what have you been doing?
- Oh, you know.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:51.257
WeII, I've been working here,

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.091
And I'm stiII finishing up at C.C.,
taking a few more cIasses.

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.859
I was actuaIIy thinking about
taking an assistant manager-

01:13:57.967 --> 01:13:59.730
CouId I get some more tea?

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:04.099
Sure. Yeah.

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:08.975

Okay, Dan,

But here are the directions
to the party.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.024
What time are you coming over?

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:29.188
I shouId be out of here soon.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.027
I'm gonna go home and change

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.431
and be right over.

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:34.730
Okay.

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:38.796
I just wanna warn you,
I might be reaIIy drunk tonight.

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:40.876
I hope you won't
think Iess of me.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:43.275
No. No, I'm not.

01:14:43.379 --> 01:14:44.971
I won't.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:48.016
Okay. WeII, I'II see you there.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.248

It was nice seeing you again.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:12.637
Yeah, you too, Dean.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.772
You too. Okay.

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:33.989
How much did he Ieave you?

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.158
He must have made
a mistake.

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:54.811
Chet, Chet.
I think you made a mistake.

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:57.750
- You gave me a hundred doIIar biII.
- No, it's aII there.

01:15:57.853 --> 01:16:02.881
- We're straight.
- The check's onIy $31. That's Iike a $70 tip.

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:07.190
Look, I just thought maybe
you needed it more than I do.

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:25.170
Hey! Dean.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:31.082
Have you thought about it?

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:33.348
You want that
assistant manager job?

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.996
- 'Weiser?
- No, thanks.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.739
Look-

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.903
HeIIo? Hey, Christy.

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.378
What's up?

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:02.241
No, I'm not.
No, I was just-

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.544
Oh.

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:09.890
Yeah, I'II see you tomorrow, then.

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:12.256
Okay. Bye. Bye.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.226
Bye.

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:19.697
- What's up with Christy?
- Oh, she's-

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.895
She's on a date.

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:24.598
That's why she wanted me
to cover her shift.

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:26.470
She's- She's stiII with him.

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:29.840
God, that's it.

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:32.846
I'm gonna-
I'm gonna change.

01:17:32.948 --> 01:17:34.540
WeII, good.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.618
You shouId start tonight.

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:40.416
- Go get one of those high schooI girIs.
- You think?

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:43.583
Mitch, I want you to know
that you did a reaIIy great job today.

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:48.186
And you didn't even cry once, which
is more than I can say for my Iast trainee.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:53.200
So, honestIy, you think you can
handIe working here?

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:59.237
- Yeah-
- Hey, fuck off for a second. I'II be right back.

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:03.968
Hey, whoa. Amy caIIed,
she toId me what happened.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:06.309
You know what?
Fuck Chet MiIIer.

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:08.440
Hey, man, reIax.

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:10.109
AII right?
ReIax. I'm okay.

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:11.345
You serious?

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:14.320
- I'd be ready to kiII someone.
- No, you know what?

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:16.414
I'm gIad he came in.
I reaIIy am.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:20.359
Yeah, he was a prick, and at first
I was so fucking pissed off,

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:22.589
but it was weird.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:26.225
In one second, it aII just kind
of snapped into perspective.

01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:29.827
PIease, eIaborate.
Did you taIk to Dan?

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:33.375
Do you want
the assistant manager job?

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:35.443
No.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:37.838
I quit.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.676
What?

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:42.774
You know, I thought about it.
I thought a Iot about it

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.410
and I know I don't wanna
wait tabIes anymore.

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:47.284
This is aII temporary.

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.323
This is supposed to be
the in-between time.

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:51.757
If I become an assistant manager,

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.260
it's just one more step
towards permanence.

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:55.887
Fuck that, man.
No way.

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:58.990
So you've reaIIy...

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:05.905
What did Dan say
when you toId him you quit?

01:19:06.008 --> 01:19:10.240
You're fIushing a goIden opportunity
down the toiIet.

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:13.338
And just so you know,
Hot Dog,

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:16.976
if you do come back,
this job won't be here for you.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.849
- I hope you're right.
- I am right!

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:22.481
- You're fired!
- I mean, I aIready quit, so-

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.286
No, you're fired!

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:26.452
I write the book, okay?

01:19:26.562 --> 01:19:28.826
Here's how it went down.
You waIked in-

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:30.455
You're fired!

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:33.694
AII right. Then, thanks for being
so mature about this and professionaI.

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:35.895
I was very professionaI.
You're fired.

01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:37.097
AII right.

01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:40.198
Get out!
Get out of my sight!

01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:42.775
- That's harsh.
- Yeah.

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:45.244
He'II be cryin' himseIf to sIeep tonight
on his cock-shaped piIIow.

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.406
What are you gonna do now?

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:51.418
I don't know.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.148
I don't know.

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:57.325
I'm definiteIy gonna do somethin'.

01:19:57.426 --> 01:19:59.257
Fuck it.

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:01.124
Let's go out there,
Iet's ceIebrate,

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:04.757
Iet's just get totaIIy fucking annihiIated,
hammered-ass drunk

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:07.062
and then run the train
on Amy.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.136
Fuck.

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.000
You reaIIy are
an asshoIe, man.

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.902
So I'm toId.

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:14.909
You're a good friend too.

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.776
Let's just keep that on the DL.
I'm aII about Iow expectations.

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:20.906
What, are you
fIirting with me?

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:24.918
Oh, by the way, CaI.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.353
I've been thinking about
your pubIic bathroom phobia.

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:30.584
- Yeah?
- I beIieve I have a soIution.

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:33.161
ReaIIy? What is it?

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:36.663
- TeII me what to do.
- Okay, but first,

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:38.323
cIose your eyes.

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:41.130
CIose my- Okay.

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:43.661
Now...

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:47.037
envision yourseIf
at a bathroom urinaI.

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:50.270
With everybody you know
crowded around you.

01:20:51.714 --> 01:20:53.944
They're cheering you on.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.643
They're chanting your name.

01:20:56.752 --> 01:20:59.277
Not only do they
want you to urinate,

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:00.787
they wanna see it.

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:04.325
- Proud of you, buddy!
- HeII, yeah!

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:07.520
- Fuckin' piss, man!

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:10.097
You can do it!

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.996
You pissing son of a bitch!

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:16.060
Now, see yourself
urinating, Calvin.

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:19.299
You can do itl
Do itl

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:21.171
Do it.

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:37.956
It's historicl

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.757
So, go ahead and visuaI that
for the next few weeks.

01:21:41.864 --> 01:21:44.230
Start off at home first,
by yourseIf.

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:46.563
Then you can move to a staII,

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:49.865
and then eventuaIIy
to an actuaI urinaI.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.108
Thanks, Bishop. I mean it.

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.835
That totaIIy makes sense.

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:58.174
Look, weII, you guys,
I'm feeIin' good.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.738
You know what? I'm gonna go taIk
to one of those high schooI girIs.

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:03.875
- WeII, good Iuck with that.
- Thank you.

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:14.562
So, what grade are you in?

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:18.660
Oh, Iook at that.
A bedroom.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.571
No.

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:35.206
What? What do you mean?

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:38.582
You start pIaying this weird, ambivaIence
buIIshit, and it makes me feeI psycho.

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.086
And I never get psycho!

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:41.713
I know.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:45.426
So I need you
to do me a favor.

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.961
I need you to not be
such a pussy.

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:51.430
Wow, there's the sass
that I was missin'.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:54.627
- You're a fIake.
- I know I'm a fIake!

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:56.897
- Fuck you!
- You can't even get a boner.

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.802
Whoa, sorry to interrupt.

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:01.137
Wait. Hey, Bishop.

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:03.905
I created my own
penis-showing game.

01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:07.542
So you quit your job.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.140
How'd you know I quit?

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:15.853
Wow.

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:22.720
Are you okay?

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.426
Is somethin' wrong?

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.669
Just checking.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.952
Wait. Wait, wait.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.581
What?

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:53.821
You turn 18
next Wednesday, right?

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:56.897
Yeah.

01:23:56.999 --> 01:23:58.523
Okay, then-

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:01.068
Why don't we make this

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:03.000
a ''to be continued...

01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:06.604
untiI next Wednesday''?

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.109
Why? Do you think
I'm gonna turn you in?

01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:12.840
- You think you're going to get arrested?
- No, no, no.

01:24:12.948 --> 01:24:16.850
I just- I feeI Iike
I don't wanna be-

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:18.647
taking ad-

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.749
- Let's just wait the week.
- Okay.

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.293
Okay.

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:33.101
But if anybody asks,
anybody at aII,

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:34.793
I fucked you.

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:38.499
Twice!

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:43.369
So, Mitch, how was
your first day?

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:47.806
WeII?

01:24:48.984 --> 01:24:50.110
WeII, it was-

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:53.244
I remember my first day.

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:55.619
What a doozy, huh?
Bishop, you're gonna Iove this.

01:24:55.724 --> 01:24:59.182
I was so nervous I dropped
this bowI of soup on a nun.

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:01.421
Hey, turn down
the music for a minute.

01:25:02.531 --> 01:25:06.661
- Hey, wouId you turn down the music?
- Dude, chiII.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:09.794
WouId you turn down the fucking music

01:25:09.905 --> 01:25:12.635

01:25:16.712 --> 01:25:17.872
None of you!

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:20.710
- WeII, damn, Mitch, I-
- Oh, no, asshoIe!

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:24.912
You shut the fuck up now.

01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:37.891
Pull out my glock
Now you pee in your pants

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:41.485
It's your last chance, I'll cut your retinas

And with the other hand
I'll doodle on some napkins

01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:03.478
Fuck you with a loaf of bread

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.644
