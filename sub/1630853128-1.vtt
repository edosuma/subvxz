[Narrator] 200 years
ago, born of flame and ash,

00:35.803 --> 00:40.808
the demon lord, Abaddon,
burst forth from the abyss

00:41.441 --> 00:45.713
and unleashed upon the land
a great and growing darkness.

00:46.881 --> 00:51.451
Five kingdoms rose up against
him, their once divided armies

00:51.485 --> 00:55.122
united against Abaddon's dread
legions.

00:55.790 --> 00:59.561
The dragons too waged war
against the demon lord

00:59.594 --> 01:03.565
and with them, an ancient
banner of knights,

01:03.598 --> 01:06.701
known as the Order of the
Dragon.

01:07.635 --> 01:12.205
The great war against Abaddon's
armies raged for 100 years.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.544
In that time, the mighty
dragons,

01:17.444 --> 01:18.412
one by one,

01:20.213 --> 01:21.081
were slain.

01:21.916 --> 01:25.853
With them, died all hope of
victory.

never to come out, for
anything, no matter what.

lives,

still the insolence of his-

subordinate!

19:51.291 --> 19:53.828
[metal scrapes]

19:56.764 --> 19:57.632
Leave him!

19:58.533 --> 20:01.401
[assassin grunts]

20:02.302 --> 20:05.006
I mean, she could do
anything. She could kill us.

20:05.039 --> 20:05.907
She could.

20:06.874 --> 20:07.742
No?

20:09.276 --> 20:12.245
She tried to kill you, twice!

20:12.279 --> 20:14.015
We can use another fighter.

20:14.048 --> 20:15.883
Teach me, then!

20:15.917 --> 20:20.922
[playful music]
[Brayden chuckles]

20:23.356 --> 20:26.293
I'm stronger than I look! And
fast.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.766
Is that so?

20:31.799 --> 20:32.667
String bean.

20:37.772 --> 20:39.040
[Edwin sighs]

20:39.073 --> 20:42.043
[crickets chirp]
[fire crackles]

20:42.076 --> 20:46.948
[Edwin grunts]
[metal clangs]

20:46.981 --> 20:49.951
[assassin chuckles]
[somber music]

20:49.984 --> 20:51.519
He is so...

20:52.587 --> 20:53.453
Innocent.

20:55.022 --> 20:56.323
His mother and father

20:58.391 --> 21:01.629
were murdered in front of him
when he was four years old.

21:06.834 --> 21:07.902
But he wasn't taken.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.842
Few have the courage to
stand against Abaddon.

21:16.476 --> 21:20.413
Rarer still are those who
would turn against him.

21:22.683 --> 21:23.818
[metal scrapes]

21:23.851 --> 21:25.820
[Edwin groans]

21:25.853 --> 21:28.022
You haven't destroyed my sword,
have you?

21:29.690 --> 21:31.324
No!

21:31.358 --> 21:32.727
Just my dignity!

21:37.865 --> 21:40.601
[fire crackles]

21:47.440 --> 21:50.611
[assassin gasps]
[gasps]

21:50.645 --> 21:52.647
[sighs]

22:00.121 --> 22:04.324
[distant birds tweet and chirp]

22:06.594 --> 22:08.395
You're taking the Akamin Pass?

22:11.799 --> 22:13.901
The King's Road is overrun
with raiders!

22:15.136 --> 22:17.104
They won't come this way.

22:17.138 --> 22:20.340
[assassin chuckles]

22:21.108 --> 22:23.010
The way of the damned.

22:24.979 --> 22:26.514
What is she talking about?

22:36.858 --> 22:40.595
[brooding orchestral music]

22:47.168 --> 22:49.469
What's the way of the damned?

22:50.805 --> 22:55.442
Not far from here, there
was a village, called Derren.

22:57.678 --> 23:00.848
One night, a scout rode in to
warn them

23:00.882 --> 23:02.382
that raiders were coming.

23:03.985 --> 23:07.088
So, they fled, abandoned their
homes

23:07.121 --> 23:11.759
and headed to the mountains,
hoping to take refuge there.

23:14.461 --> 23:18.431
They took the Akamin Pass, a
narrow route,

23:18.465 --> 23:20.500
in between the twin mountains.

23:21.636 --> 23:24.071
But the enemy had been watching
them.

23:25.973 --> 23:28.709
They knew exactly where they
were headed.

23:30.611 --> 23:31.579
They killed them?

23:32.847 --> 23:35.082
The men and women, yes.

23:36.117 --> 23:38.753
The children, they kept.

23:40.087 --> 23:41.555
For their armies?

23:41.589 --> 23:45.593
Now, they call it the way of
the damned.

23:45.626 --> 23:48.930
They say the ghosts of the
slaughtered linger there,

23:48.963 --> 23:53.567
luring any who pass through to
join them in their half life.

23:58.239 --> 23:59.840
[Edwin pants]

23:59.874 --> 24:02.910
I strongly suggest we go
another way.

24:02.944 --> 24:05.880
Just keep looking in front
of you! You'll be fine.

24:07.148 --> 24:12.153
[crickets chirp]
[ominous music]

24:18.292 --> 24:20.761
[owls hoot]

24:22.697 --> 24:24.031
[Spirit] Edwin.

24:26.701 --> 24:28.235
Don't look!

24:28.269 --> 24:29.804
[Spirit] Edwin!

24:32.907 --> 24:33.774
Edwin.

24:37.111 --> 24:37.979
Edwin.

24:48.155 --> 24:49.223
Sir Knight?

24:50.291 --> 24:51.759
Jigme!

24:51.792 --> 24:52.960
Edwin.

24:52.994 --> 24:56.897
[Edwin screams and pants]

24:56.931 --> 24:59.600
[Edin gasps]

24:59.633 --> 25:00.500
Edwin.

25:02.236 --> 25:03.237
Sweet child.

25:07.942 --> 25:12.947
Come.
[Edwin yelps]

25:13.681 --> 25:15.082
Sir Knight!

25:15.116 --> 25:16.250
Where are you?

25:20.254 --> 25:23.190
[breathes heavily]

25:29.330 --> 25:34.535
[wind whistles]
[crickets chirp]

25:46.847 --> 25:47.715
Jigme?

25:52.720 --> 25:53.654
[Spirit] My love.

25:54.655 --> 25:55.923
My fearless one.

26:01.729 --> 26:03.130
My love.

26:03.164 --> 26:05.199
[wind howls]

26:05.232 --> 26:06.700
My fearless one.

26:08.869 --> 26:10.104
No! Jigme!

26:10.137 --> 26:13.340
[spirit shrieks]

26:13.374 --> 26:15.009
Jigme!
[Jigme gasps]

26:15.042 --> 26:15.910
Wake up!

26:16.977 --> 26:19.180
It's all right now, she's gone!

26:19.213 --> 26:20.581
Snap out of it!

26:22.283 --> 26:25.753
[Jigme gasps and pants]

26:27.988 --> 26:28.856
Where is she?

26:30.024 --> 26:30.791
I must go with her.

26:32.393 --> 26:34.361
That thing was about to kill
you!

26:36.964 --> 26:38.032
That was my mother.

26:40.935 --> 26:42.970
But, how is that...

26:47.842 --> 26:49.076
Were you taken that day?

26:55.249 --> 26:58.052
[Jigme sniffles]

27:01.322 --> 27:02.690
We should keep moving.

27:05.326 --> 27:10.331
[stream babbles]
[birds tweet]

27:19.206 --> 27:21.809

27:36.090 --> 27:39.026
[man yelps]

27:39.059 --> 27:40.761
[Man] [yelps] No, no, no!

27:40.794 --> 27:45.799
[metal scrapes]
[ominous music]

28:00.881 --> 28:03.284
[Edwin pants]

28:10.791 --> 28:12.426
They're coming!

28:12.459 --> 28:13.894
- Who?
- Faceless!

28:13.928 --> 28:15.129
- How many?
- Too many.

28:15.162 --> 28:16.797
We have to go, now!

28:17.932 --> 28:18.799
Run!

28:19.833 --> 28:20.701
Run!

28:21.902 --> 28:25.239
[tense orchestral music]

29:05.212 --> 29:07.815

29:17.592 --> 29:22.796
[somber music]
[distant flames crackle]

29:48.222 --> 29:50.525
[Edwin] How far is it to the
castle?

29:50.558 --> 29:52.159
[Brayden] Half a day's walk.

29:55.162 --> 29:57.998
I thought kings were supposed
to protect their people!

29:59.567 --> 30:03.837
The kings of Agonos are
not what they used to be.

30:04.872 --> 30:07.207
[Edwin sobs]

30:24.158 --> 30:26.226
This is where I leave you.

30:26.260 --> 30:28.028
I don't think an assassin of
Abaddon

30:28.062 --> 30:29.897
will be welcome in the king's
court.

30:32.966 --> 30:34.001
You're with us now.

30:35.903 --> 30:38.540
I may be known here. I won't
put your mission at risk.

30:45.446 --> 30:49.216
My father gave this to
me on the day he died.

30:50.451 --> 30:52.486
He told me to keep it safe.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.988
That one day, it could help us.

30:57.057 --> 30:58.192
I did as he asked.

30:59.426 --> 31:02.196
But after all these years, I
still don't know what he meant.

31:05.466 --> 31:07.167
Maybe you will learn its secret.

31:10.170 --> 31:11.573
[footsteps recede]

31:11.606 --> 31:15.610
If Thollin is willing to
fight, will you fight with us?

31:20.414 --> 31:25.419
[brooding orchestral music]
[doors creak]

31:46.440 --> 31:48.976
I see you wear the
costume of a Dragon Knight.

31:50.043 --> 31:52.913
But of course, that order is
long dead.

31:55.149 --> 31:59.052
How shall I execute this, uh,
pretender?

31:59.086 --> 32:00.588
By ax?

32:00.622 --> 32:02.189
Or by sword?

32:03.190 --> 32:05.926
It is for my father
that I wear the symbol

32:06.694 --> 32:09.329
and in his name, I implore you
to fight,

32:09.363 --> 32:12.199
drive out the evil that's
spread in your lands!

32:12.232 --> 32:14.268
Castle Dunn has stood for
1,000 years

32:14.301 --> 32:16.036
and it will stand 1,000 more!

32:16.069 --> 32:17.639
You may be safe behind these
walls,

32:17.672 --> 32:20.474
but have you not seen what
is happening in the villages?

32:20.508 --> 32:23.678
Your people are slaughtered
while you hide in your castle!

32:23.711 --> 32:25.479
Who are you to question a
king?

32:25.513 --> 32:27.314
Get these traitors out of my
sight!

32:27.347 --> 32:28.550
Father, please!

32:33.053 --> 32:33.721
Hear them.

32:37.659 --> 32:40.494
[throne creaks]

32:40.528 --> 32:42.730
How many men do you command?

32:44.398 --> 32:46.033
Enough to do my bidding.

32:47.434 --> 32:51.138
Is it your bidding
that your men stand idle

32:51.171 --> 32:54.074
while there, women and children
burn?

32:54.107 --> 32:56.644
I have barely enough
men to hold the castle.

32:58.145 --> 33:00.180
The king's guard is 100
strong.

33:00.214 --> 33:03.585
Another 100 men are posted at
the Fort of Cairn to the west.

33:03.618 --> 33:07.287
Our numbers are so few to
maintain peace with Abaddon.

33:08.656 --> 33:11.225
Under Abaddon, there will be
no peace!

33:12.226 --> 33:13.126
Heresy!

33:13.160 --> 33:14.027
Treason!

33:19.333 --> 33:24.137
What use are 200 men
against the armies of Abaddon?

33:25.740 --> 33:28.710
The war was lost before you were
born.

33:28.743 --> 33:33.380
The dragons are long dead and
the old gods have forsaken us.

33:34.616 --> 33:37.184
We cannot resist

33:38.452 --> 33:39.554
what's to come.

33:42.256 --> 33:46.293
My father often spoke to me

33:46.326 --> 33:48.228
of your fearlessness in battle!

33:49.329 --> 33:50.732
Your father, too, was brave.

33:51.833 --> 33:53.233
And look what it got him.

33:55.202 --> 33:58.272
If called, the people
would fight for you, Father,

33:58.305 --> 33:59.373
and for their freedom.

34:05.713 --> 34:08.583
An emissary, sire, from Mount
Voros.

34:11.451 --> 34:14.487
He will speak of peace,
but offers only tyranny!

34:15.723 --> 34:17.090
I will hear him out.

34:21.295 --> 34:23.230
[ominous music]
[muffled wind howls]

34:23.263 --> 34:26.333
[footsteps approach]

35:01.468 --> 35:04.471
To what do I owe this honor,
Saskak?

35:05.940 --> 35:07.809
[Saskak] My lord Abaddon

35:07.842 --> 35:10.745
can no longer tolerate your
heresy.

35:13.213 --> 35:15.516
I would hardly say that
he has been tolerant.

35:16.450 --> 35:18.185
[Saskak] He has,

35:19.186 --> 35:20.287
in his mercy,

35:21.288 --> 35:23.691
spared the castle.

35:23.725 --> 35:27.862
Riddled, though it is, with
dissenters and heretics.

35:29.296 --> 35:32.734
This reprieve, however,

35:32.767 --> 35:34.802
must now come to and end.

35:36.336 --> 35:39.641
You come here to taunt
me with threats of war!

35:40.708 --> 35:43.778
I don't know what horrors lie
beneath that helmet of yours,

35:43.811 --> 35:45.880
but I will have your head and
find out!

35:47.247 --> 35:48.916
[Saskak] The question, king,

35:48.950 --> 35:53.253
is not what lies behind my mask,

35:53.286 --> 35:56.256
but what rests beneath your
crown.

35:57.391 --> 36:00.494
For I have not come to threaten
war,

36:01.495 --> 36:03.898
but to offer peace.

36:03.931 --> 36:07.802
If you are wise enough to choose
it.

36:11.471 --> 36:15.710
Pledge fealty to the lord of the
abyss,

36:15.743 --> 36:18.278
the one true god, Abaddon,

36:19.881 --> 36:23.417
and you, and all who serve him,

36:24.351 --> 36:26.186
shall enjoy his favor.

36:29.791 --> 36:31.793
And you will spare the
villagers?

36:33.828 --> 36:37.464
[Saskak] Those who
accept the rule of Abaddon

36:37.497 --> 36:40.233
shall know peace,

36:40.267 --> 36:42.369
in this life and the next.

36:44.539 --> 36:46.373
You would offer up your
subjects

36:46.406 --> 36:48.375
like lambs to the slaughter!

36:48.408 --> 36:50.678
Destroy whatever freedoms they
have left,

36:50.712 --> 36:55.248
for these false promises of
peace!

36:55.282 --> 36:58.720
Ignore this war monger.

36:58.753 --> 37:01.589
A great alliance is finally at
hand.

37:03.624 --> 37:04.491
I need time.

37:06.293 --> 37:09.564
[Saskak] Answer to us this
day, king,

37:09.597 --> 37:11.999
or to his black legion,

37:12.033 --> 37:13.835
tomorrow and forever.

37:15.069 --> 37:17.705
Tell our lord that I accept
his offer.

37:17.739 --> 37:18.606
Father!

37:21.341 --> 37:23.811
[armor clinks]

37:39.493 --> 37:42.295
[footsteps thud]

37:48.503 --> 37:52.607
Let us herald this new era of
peace!

37:52.640 --> 37:55.342
Hail to the wisdom of King
Thollin!

37:56.443 --> 37:58.311
Wisest of all men!

38:00.581 --> 38:02.315
Throw them in the dungeon.

38:02.349 --> 38:03.017
No!

38:07.054 --> 38:09.322
[grunts]

38:24.038 --> 38:25.673
What have you done?

38:25.706 --> 38:27.842
[somber orchestral music]

38:27.875 --> 38:29.710
One day, you will be king.

38:31.913 --> 38:34.347
And then you will understand.

38:36.117 --> 38:38.318
There is only one king now,
Father,

38:40.688 --> 38:42.355
and his name is Abaddon.

38:43.758 --> 38:46.894
[distant water drips]

38:53.701 --> 38:56.369
[Edwin groans]

38:59.640 --> 39:00.942
[Edwin gasps]

39:00.975 --> 39:03.376
There's something inside!

39:18.025 --> 39:20.027
[gasps]

39:21.562 --> 39:24.932
"The key will come disguised as
death."

39:24.966 --> 39:26.133
She was talking about Jigme!

39:27.869 --> 39:32.707
This map will lead us through
the mountain, to the dragon!

39:32.740 --> 39:34.976
Even if you are right about
the map,

39:35.009 --> 39:37.678
there are 1,000 mountains in
Agonos.

39:37.712 --> 39:40.948
We have no idea which
one this dragon hides in.

[prisoner giggles]

39:44.118 --> 39:46.020

39:46.053 --> 39:49.023
They thought the dragon dead.

39:50.992 --> 39:53.493
Uh, excuse me?

39:53.527 --> 39:55.529
I didn't quite...

39:55.563 --> 39:57.531
They can't find it. They
can't.

39:57.565 --> 39:59.700
Tunnels and tunnels.

39:59.734 --> 40:03.070

They never come back.

40:06.473 --> 40:09.777
Are you talking about
the dragon's labyrinth?

40:09.810 --> 40:12.647
He's been down here too
long. Pay him no mind!

[prisoner mumbles]

40:26.694 --> 40:30.231
They wanted to take my head.

We haven't got long.

41:08.869 --> 41:10.204
You don't want to escape?

41:12.139 --> 41:15.109
Down here, he can't see me.

41:21.048 --> 41:23.784
[Brayden sighs]

41:28.622 --> 41:31.659
- How could this happen?
- We are on their trail, sire!

41:31.692 --> 41:33.094
We will find them.

41:34.762 --> 41:35.629
No.

41:37.698 --> 41:38.566
Sire?

Where were they going?

42:09.330 --> 42:12.033
[prisoner breathes heavily]

42:12.066 --> 42:15.569
Tell me what you know or I'll
send you back to the pit.

42:15.603 --> 42:17.204
The way is long.

42:17.238 --> 42:20.174
But, but the day, the day
is longer than the night.

42:20.207 --> 42:24.111
Do not play your riddling
games with me!

42:29.350 --> 42:30.217
The dragon.

42:31.352 --> 42:32.219
They know.

42:33.087 --> 42:34.655
They know about the dragon.

42:35.723 --> 42:36.690
They seek it.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.227
And?

42:42.263 --> 42:43.564
Answer to me.

42:44.899 --> 42:45.766
Or...

42:46.867 --> 42:48.202
Answer to Abaddon!

42:51.839 --> 42:52.840
Speak, child.

42:55.743 --> 42:58.212
They, they have the, the map.

43:05.386 --> 43:06.620

He said something that
I didn't understand.

43:47.294 --> 43:48.429
Well, I mean, he said a lot of
things

43:48.462 --> 43:49.730
that I didn't understand.

43:49.763 --> 43:50.698
Spit it out.

43:52.099 --> 43:55.636
I think it was Saskak. Do you
speak it?

43:59.240 --> 44:00.107
He said...

44:01.842 --> 44:05.246
[speaks foreign language]

44:07.715 --> 44:09.884
"Heart of fire"?

44:09.917 --> 44:11.886
What do you think he meant?

44:11.919 --> 44:16.824
Stop searching for hope,
in the ravings of a mad man!

44:16.857 --> 44:19.293
You're wasting your time!

44:19.326 --> 44:20.794
[groans]

44:20.828 --> 44:21.929
But we have to...

Try.

[Brayden breathes heavily]

45:01.536 --> 45:02.803
I'm tired.

45:04.305 --> 45:05.940
So rest.

A dragon that hides in a

Sounds like just another coward.

45:18.886 --> 45:22.890
You're afraid you'll
fail, just as they are.

45:22.923 --> 45:24.892
If they won't fight for
themselves,

45:24.925 --> 45:26.393
why should I fight for them?

45:27.928 --> 45:29.430

The heart of fire.

It's a mountain in Skaargard.

Stay with him.

55:08.976 --> 55:11.311
Many more will come.

How you have weakened since
you turned against our lord.

The map.

55:26.393 --> 55:27.995
I have what you want.

before giving it to you.

[Saskak] So be it.

55:36.671 --> 55:37.538

It's lucky

57:23.110 --> 57:25.813
that I made a copy, then.

We can still make it to

Just find the dragon.

in?

soon,

thousands of innocent people
will die!

01:00:56.157 --> 01:00:57.691
I know.

01:00:57.725 --> 01:01:00.227
So, if you're tired,

01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:03.063
I suggest you rest!

01:01:03.097 --> 01:01:05.132
Because you're slowing me down!

01:01:06.233 --> 01:01:07.902
Wait! Sir Knight!

01:01:09.103 --> 01:01:11.105
[sighs]

01:01:14.775 --> 01:01:17.378
[sinister music]

01:01:31.425 --> 01:01:35.896
[brooding orchestral music]
[rock clacks]

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:38.732
[Brayden grunts]

01:01:40.467 --> 01:01:43.204
[Brayden roars]

01:01:49.076 --> 01:01:51.812
[wind whistles]

01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:04.425
[playful music]

01:02:19.139 --> 01:02:21.342
[chuckles]

01:02:24.278 --> 01:02:26.413
[sneezes]

01:02:29.984 --> 01:02:32.119
[screams]

01:02:35.889 --> 01:02:37.891
[sighs]

01:02:42.329 --> 01:02:43.531
Stupid berries.

01:02:54.308 --> 01:02:57.244
[breathes heavily]

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.114
Yes!

01:03:00.147 --> 01:03:01.315
Yes!

01:03:01.348 --> 01:03:02.216
Yes!

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:07.321
[wind whistles]

01:03:07.354 --> 01:03:09.557
[whistles]

01:03:12.527 --> 01:03:15.996
[dark orchestral music]

01:03:24.606 --> 01:03:25.873
What is it?

01:03:35.416 --> 01:03:37.885
[pats back]

01:04:01.175 --> 01:04:06.180
[suspenseful music]
[distant water drips]

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.868
It can't be too much further.

01:04:29.436 --> 01:04:30.304
Left.

01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:43.585
[muffled growls]

01:04:52.393 --> 01:04:57.398
[Brayden] Let's go!

01:04:58.399 --> 01:05:00.968
That should be it! Through
that door!

01:05:02.035 --> 01:05:02.970
Stay behind me!

01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:08.175
[metal scrapes]
[pants]

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:11.211
[suspenseful music]

01:05:30.431 --> 01:05:33.033
[man shrieks]

01:05:37.171 --> 01:05:40.307
[flames whoosh]

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.409
[grunts]

01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:49.483
What do you do? You just take
up space!

01:05:49.517 --> 01:05:51.985
Go wherever you want to
go and don't come back!

01:05:52.019 --> 01:05:54.421
I'm sick of you! I'm sick of
you!

01:05:54.455 --> 01:05:57.191
[Edwin screams]

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.529
[grunts]

01:06:01.563 --> 01:06:04.164
[man shrieks]

01:06:12.607 --> 01:06:15.209
[man shrieks]

01:06:22.684 --> 01:06:25.018
Think of something good.

01:06:26.086 --> 01:06:28.088
Think of something good.

01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:33.427
Think of something good!

01:06:35.763 --> 01:06:38.432
[Brayden grunts]
[man shrieks]

01:06:38.465 --> 01:06:39.601
You can fight it.

01:06:39.634 --> 01:06:40.501
Come on!

01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:43.103
Think of...

01:06:43.136 --> 01:06:45.339
Me, falling over, like an idiot!

01:06:46.406 --> 01:06:48.308
Of...

01:06:48.342 --> 01:06:50.244
A hot, steaming rabbit pie!

01:06:51.613 --> 01:06:53.413
Think of, think of...

01:06:55.517 --> 01:06:56.718
Think of Jigme!

01:07:01.121 --> 01:07:03.725
That's it. That's it, come on.

01:07:03.758 --> 01:07:07.227
[Brayden breathes sharply]

01:07:07.261 --> 01:07:10.264
[Brayden grunts]

01:07:10.297 --> 01:07:13.033
[Brayden roars]

01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:19.473
[whooshing]

01:07:21.543 --> 01:07:22.442
Are you all right?

01:07:25.847 --> 01:07:28.650
[Brayden grunts]

01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:35.489
[Brayden breathes heavily]

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.462
[brooding orchestral music]

01:07:42.496 --> 01:07:44.599
For what pressing concern
have I been wrenched

01:07:44.632 --> 01:07:46.568
from my bed in the dead of
night?

01:07:46.601 --> 01:07:50.404
She came to the gates,
demanding to speak with you, sire.

01:07:50.437 --> 01:07:54.107
When we refused, she drew her
dagger.

01:07:54.141 --> 01:07:56.711
She claims to speak
for the Dragon Knight.

01:07:59.212 --> 01:08:01.481
I thought I had made my
position clear.

01:08:01.516 --> 01:08:05.485
I have pledged fealty to
Abaddon in exchange for peace.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.122
And yet, and a faceless
army has crossed your border

01:08:09.156 --> 01:08:12.225
and makes camp not two
days march from the castle.

01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:13.528
War is coming!

01:08:15.863 --> 01:08:18.165
But I have done nothing to
provoke this.

01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:25.471
The merest offense
is treason to Abaddon,

01:08:25.506 --> 01:08:28.710
and I suspect you have
a spy in your midst.

01:08:33.648 --> 01:08:34.716
How many are they?

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:37.819
An entire legion.

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:45.727
You must call for
reinforcements.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.563
I will go to the Fort of
Cairn and rally them myself.

01:08:48.595 --> 01:08:50.464
You would not make it back in
time.

01:08:51.832 --> 01:08:53.265
For what?

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.902
To save the castle.

01:08:57.904 --> 01:08:59.372
Then what can we do?

01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:05.479
We will cut them off
at the Valley of Gavern.

01:09:07.915 --> 01:09:11.283
Rally the troops at Cairn
and lead them there.

01:09:11.318 --> 01:09:13.854
I will take the king's guard
and ride out to meet you.

01:09:15.857 --> 01:09:16.724
Father.

01:09:19.493 --> 01:09:21.529
If we can at least delay their
advance,

01:09:22.897 --> 01:09:24.497
we may give the women and
children

01:09:24.532 --> 01:09:26.198
a chance to flee the castle.

01:09:37.243 --> 01:09:42.249
You do realize, don't you, that
not one of us shall survive?

01:09:44.952 --> 01:09:46.953
Nothing is certain, sire.

01:09:59.332 --> 01:10:01.736
[Edwin yelps]

01:10:06.607 --> 01:10:11.612
[chain clinks]
[ominous music]

01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:29.463
[muffled growls]

01:10:34.569 --> 01:10:37.370
[muffled growls]

01:10:43.077 --> 01:10:48.348
[dragon roars]
[fire roars]

01:10:48.381 --> 01:10:52.520
I am Brayden of Alloway,
last of the Dragon Knights,

01:10:52.553 --> 01:10:54.555
and I summon you to war!

01:10:54.589 --> 01:10:55.823
[dragon roars]

01:10:55.857 --> 01:10:58.559
[flames roar]

01:10:58.593 --> 01:11:01.461
The people you are sworn to
protect

01:11:01.495 --> 01:11:03.731
are driven from their homes,

01:11:03.765 --> 01:11:05.499
tortured, massacred!

01:11:06.968 --> 01:11:08.669
By Abaddon's armies.

01:11:09.537 --> 01:11:11.706
And you do nothing.

01:11:12.707 --> 01:11:15.543
What kind of dragon are you?

01:11:15.576 --> 01:11:18.311
[dragon growls]

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:22.784
It is not too late to
reclaim your honor, dragon.

01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:24.519
Come with us now and fight!

01:11:25.485 --> 01:11:26.921
Rise up once more,

01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:30.958
and fill the sky with
the glory of your flame.

01:11:30.992 --> 01:11:35.563
Together, we can rid the
world of the demon Abaddon.

01:11:36.864 --> 01:11:39.600
[dragon sniffs]

01:11:41.434 --> 01:11:44.906
[dragon growls and snorts]

01:11:47.742 --> 01:11:51.946
This is not a request. It is a
command!

01:11:51.979 --> 01:11:54.816
It is your duty, as it is mine,

01:11:54.849 --> 01:11:57.718
to stand against the tide of
evil!

01:11:57.752 --> 01:11:59.887
If we do not fight, it will win,

01:12:01.421 --> 01:12:02.990
and Agonos will fall.

01:12:07.829 --> 01:12:12.834
[footsteps thump]
[dragon growls]

01:12:15.002 --> 01:12:17.839
We came here to find a dragon...

01:12:17.872 --> 01:12:19.507
[sighs]

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.877
But I see now that they're all
long dead!

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.716
[dragon growls]

01:12:32.787 --> 01:12:35.422
You can't just give up.
We have to keep trying!

01:12:35.455 --> 01:12:37.390
- He's not going to help us.
- But...

01:12:37.424 --> 01:12:40.460
[grunts] We will go to
Dunn and we will fight!

01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:41.829
Even if he won't!

01:12:41.863 --> 01:12:43.496
But without the dragon-

01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:45.833
- [Brayden] We've survived
100 years without a dragon!

01:12:45.867 --> 01:12:47.068
What's another day?

01:12:48.936 --> 01:12:49.604
[Edwin sighs]

01:12:49.637 --> 01:12:52.506
Just think about it, please!

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:53.406
Wait!

01:12:54.909 --> 01:12:55.877
Sir Knight.

01:12:57.178 --> 01:12:59.914
[ominous music]

01:13:06.654 --> 01:13:09.389
[metal scrapes]

01:13:11.959 --> 01:13:14.629
[metal clangs]

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:19.834
[Saskak] Even the
dragon refuses your call.

01:13:19.867 --> 01:13:24.505
[Brayden grunts]
[metal clangs]

01:13:24.538 --> 01:13:25.940
All who follow you

01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:28.943
will die, Dragon Knight.

01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:30.912
You first.

01:13:30.945 --> 01:13:36.050
[metal clangs]
[flesh squelches]

01:13:40.821 --> 01:13:44.892
Let's get you out of here.
[Edwin screams]

01:13:44.926 --> 01:13:49.830
[Edwin breathes sharply]
[somber orchestral music]

01:13:49.864 --> 01:13:50.731
Go.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.068
Save them.

01:13:56.837 --> 01:13:57.905
I'll be fine.

01:13:59.874 --> 01:14:02.475
I'm not leaving without you.

01:14:03.244 --> 01:14:07.715
[Edwin sobs]
[chain clinks]

01:14:07.748 --> 01:14:09.550
Give this to Jigme.

01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:15.523
[groans]

01:14:15.556 --> 01:14:16.824
No.

01:14:16.857 --> 01:14:18.526
You give it to her.

01:14:19.727 --> 01:14:21.896
I've had the best adventure of
my life.

01:14:22.797 --> 01:14:25.599
[groans]

01:14:25.633 --> 01:14:27.268
[sobs]

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.736
I went to a castle.

01:14:31.739 --> 01:14:32.606
Met a king.

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:35.776
[groans]

01:14:36.744 --> 01:14:38.779
And saw a dragon.

01:14:38.813 --> 01:14:40.815
[coughs]

01:14:40.848 --> 01:14:41.716
I'm happy.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.522
[pants]

01:14:50.758 --> 01:14:51.625
Go.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.227
Go!

01:14:54.562 --> 01:14:56.630
[groans]

01:15:12.046 --> 01:15:15.649

[metal scrapes]

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:38.365
Take me to your king!

01:16:42.837 --> 01:16:45.372
[metal scrapes]

01:16:46.407 --> 01:16:49.143
[fires crackle]

01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:32.052
I wasn't sure I'd see you
again.

01:17:35.856 --> 01:17:39.059
Is there no dragon?
[brooding orchestral music]

01:17:39.093 --> 01:17:42.963
The dragon lives, but
he will not fight for us.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.735
And where is Edwin?

01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:57.011
[chain clinks]

01:17:58.979 --> 01:18:00.414
He found it.

01:18:00.447 --> 01:18:03.117
[chain clinks]

01:18:10.357 --> 01:18:12.059
We fight for Edwin Nath.

01:18:18.799 --> 01:18:20.968
[crow caws]

01:18:21.001 --> 01:18:24.939

[distant marching]

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.038
Hold!

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.216
[distant marching]

01:19:58.899 --> 01:20:01.268

01:20:10.144 --> 01:20:11.845
Stupid dragon!

[muffled growls]

01:20:40.642 --> 01:20:42.443
Why didn't you use your fire?

01:20:47.448 --> 01:20:50.585
[dragon growls]

01:20:50.618 --> 01:20:53.153
Isn't that what dragons do?

01:20:53.187 --> 01:20:54.054
Breathe fire?

01:20:58.526 --> 01:21:00.094

[dragon growls]

01:21:18.278 --> 01:21:19.647
If you got your fire back...

01:21:23.283 --> 01:21:24.151
Would you fight?

Take him to safety!

01:24:40.748 --> 01:24:41.616
No!

01:24:42.584 --> 01:24:44.819
Come with me, sire!

01:24:44.852 --> 01:24:47.589
[metal scrapes]

01:24:49.691 --> 01:24:52.492
[Saskak] Abaddon weeps for
you.

01:24:54.328 --> 01:24:56.664

[Jigme grunts]

01:29:21.596 --> 01:29:24.131
[Saskak] Seeing you like this,

01:29:26.534 --> 01:29:28.135
prone and whimpering,

01:29:29.937 --> 01:29:32.506
you remind me of your mother.

01:29:34.675 --> 01:29:37.612
You were just a mewing infant
then.

01:29:39.547 --> 01:29:41.649
How you wailed

01:29:41.682 --> 01:29:42.617
as my grip

01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:45.086
tightened

01:29:46.486 --> 01:29:47.889
around her throat.

01:29:54.962 --> 01:29:55.997
[Brayden grunts]

01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.898
No!

01:29:59.166 --> 01:30:03.671
[dragon roars]
[dramatic orchestral music]

01:30:03.704 --> 01:30:06.439

01:30:14.548 --> 01:30:15.816
I have a message

01:30:16.717 --> 01:30:17.985

01:31:32.259 --> 01:31:34.996
[dragon growls]

01:31:40.301 --> 01:31:42.870
That's quite unnecessary,
really.

01:31:44.872 --> 01:31:47.608
[dragon growls]

01:31:55.082 --> 01:31:55.883
Sorry I'm late.

01:31:59.153 --> 01:32:01.022
You convinced the dragon to
fight?

01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:04.525
He lost his fire.

01:32:06.727 --> 01:32:07.595
I just

01:32:08.896 --> 01:32:09.897
gave it back to him.

01:32:10.765 --> 01:32:13.601
[Brayden grunts]

01:32:13.634 --> 01:32:14.702
This man is hurt!

01:32:15.736 --> 01:32:16.871
He needs help!

01:32:21.809 --> 01:32:23.177
T'is good to see you.

01:32:24.845 --> 01:32:25.713
Friend.

01:32:40.127 --> 01:32:45.132
[somber orchestral music]
[wind whistles]

01:33:03.784 --> 01:33:05.352
We have won the battle!

01:33:06.353 --> 01:33:10.024
But the war for our
freedom has just begun!

01:33:13.694 --> 01:33:14.795
Will you fight?

01:33:14.829 --> 01:33:17.631
[soldiers cheer]

01:33:22.002 --> 01:33:24.972
[dragon growls]

01:33:25.005 --> 01:33:25.973
Not today.

01:33:27.708 --> 01:33:30.778
Today, we hail the Dragon
Knight!

01:33:30.811 --> 01:33:32.646
[soldiers cheer]

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.748
All hail the Dragon Knight!

01:33:37.718 --> 01:33:41.922
I did not fight alone!

01:33:41.956 --> 01:33:43.357
Alone, we cannot win.

01:33:44.925 --> 01:33:47.161
Only when we stand together

01:33:47.194 --> 01:33:50.164
will we defeat the evil that is
Abaddon.

01:33:51.065 --> 01:33:52.766
[Soldiers] Aye!

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.203
Today, we have lost friends.

01:33:57.371 --> 01:33:58.239
Brothers.

01:33:59.373 --> 01:34:00.274
Sons.

01:34:03.244 --> 01:34:05.045
I have lost a father!

01:34:06.447 --> 01:34:08.249
And Dunn, a king!

01:34:11.218 --> 01:34:12.119
But tomorrow...

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:17.358
Tomorrow, we fight to reclaim
our kingdom.

01:34:17.391 --> 01:34:18.392
Our freedom!

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:20.394
Our hope!

01:34:21.996 --> 01:34:25.432
Never again can we allow fear to
rule us,

01:34:25.466 --> 01:34:29.170
for it is fear itself that
breeds evil.

01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:33.174
It is fear that allows Abaddon
to reign!

01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:36.076
No more!

01:34:37.912 --> 01:34:40.714
[soldiers cheer]

01:34:45.819 --> 01:34:48.756
[dragon growls]

01:34:48.789 --> 01:34:50.925
Like our forefathers,

01:34:50.958 --> 01:34:54.328
we will rise up against
the forces of the abyss!

01:34:56.230 --> 01:34:57.698
But this time...

01:34:58.766 --> 01:35:00.201
We will win!

01:35:01.368 --> 01:35:04.171
