The woman was abandoned

Oh, you wanna talk about your

to box with God

03:39.486 --> 03:41.587

03:41.589 --> 03:43.589
Honey, just know
that you are beloved,

will shine brighter

Ooh!

03:51.765 --> 03:53.432
Excuse me!

03:53.434 --> 03:54.833
How embarrassing!

03:54.835 --> 03:57.035
I am so, so sorry.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.538
Auntie Mama, you never have
to apologize to me.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.107
You can be as outrageous
as you want to be.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.041
You know what?

04:03.043 --> 04:06.144

04:18.125 --> 04:19.925

recognize her.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.509
You should talk.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.377
Cleveland...?

05:12.379 --> 05:15.013
Auntie Mama,
you haven't changed a bit.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.015
Have you?

05:17.017 --> 05:20.152
Now, Cleveland, every girl
has to have her secrets.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.586

What do you want?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.989
I need your help

05:23.991 --> 05:25.090
(deep voice):
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.358
I can't help you with that.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.293
But you must know
where she is.

05:28.295 --> 05:30.829
She's your sister
and she entrusted you,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.998
or a version of you,
to raise Donna

05:33.000 --> 05:35.334
as your daughter,
or your son.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.636
I don't know how these things
work in your community,

05:37.638 --> 05:41.006
which I respect but don't want
to know anything more about.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.541
I did try to find her.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.976
But I came up empty
every time.

05:44.978 --> 05:48.280
Did it ever occur to you that...
(clears throat)

05:48.282 --> 05:50.115
(normal voice):
Did it ever occur to you

05:50.117 --> 05:51.950
that Dee Dee might not
want to be found?

05:51.952 --> 05:52.784
Who's Dee Dee?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.786
Dorothy.
Who's Dorothy?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.621
Dorothy "Dee Dee" Tubbs.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.023
Donna's mama.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.024

listening better.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.866
Good-bye, Cleveland.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.768
It's not for me, you know.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.871
It's for Donna.
She's hurting.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.306
We both love her.

06:14.308 --> 06:15.874
We should both help her.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.544
She really needs this bad, huh?

06:19.546 --> 06:22.381
No, it's just her mom!

06:22.383 --> 06:24.416
Should we see if we can dig
anything up

06:24.418 --> 06:25.684
at the Hall of Records?
Yes!

06:51.145 --> 06:53.311
Okay, that was
pretty good.

Dorothy Tubbs.

06:55.449 --> 06:58.517
Last I have is a driver's
license renewal in 1992,

06:58.519 --> 06:59.951
but after that, nothing.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.453
She's either
hiding or dead.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.121
Dag, we got nothing.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.657
Wait! Would you mind doing
Reagan for my boss, Tracy?

07:05.659 --> 07:06.825
What?

07:06.827 --> 07:09.127
Contrary to popular belief,

07:09.129 --> 07:13.632
I raised taxes 11 times

07:13.634 --> 07:16.668

07:19.005 --> 07:21.506
Why did I ever think
I could help Donna?

07:21.508 --> 07:23.975
I don't even know anything

07:23.977 --> 07:26.011
For all I know,
any of the women here

07:26.013 --> 07:27.879
could be Donna's mom.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.614
She could be Donna's mom.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.949
She could be
Donna's mom.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.950
She could be...

07:31.952 --> 07:34.953
(gasps)
I have a terrible idea.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.923

You're a better finder

my badge and gun.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.924
Holy (bleep), it's real!

08:12.926 --> 08:14.459
I'm gonna go put on
my sweatpants

08:14.461 --> 08:18.029
and hang out with the New York
Giants at a nightclub.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.097
(screams)

08:19.099 --> 08:20.632

peppermint candies, are you?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.536

Loose gum?

08:24.538 --> 08:25.937

08:47.995 --> 08:49.661
assistant.
Wow.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.429
Really?
An astronaut's assistant?

08:51.431 --> 08:53.131
That's a common occupation.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.500
You know, you and I
do not look much alike.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.769
(clears throat)
You know what, Donna,

08:57.771 --> 09:00.472
I'll take that reward
chocolate milk now.

09:00.474 --> 09:01.940
Can't you make your own?

09:01.942 --> 09:03.508
It's chocolate mixed with mi...

09:03.510 --> 09:05.644
Bup, bup, bup.
Maintain the magic.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.978
Cleveland.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.514
Excuse me for a moment.

09:09.516 --> 09:10.882
Astronaut?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.818
Your resume had "improv"
under special skills.

09:13.820 --> 09:17.522
I'm starting to wonder if
you can really do rope tricks.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.090
Uh-yum.

09:19.092 --> 09:22.160
I've been thinking
about this moment my whole life,

09:22.162 --> 09:25.697
but now that it's here,
I don't know what to say.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.965
Great!

09:26.967 --> 09:29.167
Well, you've met.
All is forgiven...

09:29.169 --> 09:32.037
All right, Dee Dee,
thanks for stopping by.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.439
Don't you want to
know why I left?

09:34.441 --> 09:34.973
What?!

09:34.975 --> 09:36.808
I do. Yes, I do.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.676
(groans)

09:37.678 --> 09:39.444
(sighs)

09:39.446 --> 09:41.846
Because I knew in my heart
that I couldn't give you

09:41.848 --> 09:44.683
any more or any less
than all of my heart.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.684
And since I could not

09:45.686 --> 09:46.785
give that to you,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.453
I had to give you

09:48.455 --> 09:50.355
to the world.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.957
And scene.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.426
You did the best you could.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.795
I feel bad for my dumb wife.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.030
So, who was my father?

09:59.032 --> 10:00.030
How should I know?

10:00.032 --> 10:03.268
Okay, well, we're all
very emotional right now.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.471
But if we're gonna get you
to the Days Inn by sundown...

10:06.473 --> 10:08.707
Cleveland, she's staying here.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.508
In our bed.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.310
Fine, but she's
not allowed to look

10:12.312 --> 10:14.512
while we're doing
our maritals.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.918
You know, Rallo has
his recital this Sunday.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.953
I wish you didn't have
to leave tomorrow.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.622
I do too, baby...

10:23.624 --> 10:26.358
If wishes were horses,
and horses were cars,

10:26.360 --> 10:28.193
we'd have a dealership.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.662
...which is why
I have decided to stay.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.330
That's wonderful.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.599
I'll clear out
a drawer for you.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.468
Cleveland, you don't
need all these shirts.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.971
Look, Shirl, it is time
for you to go.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.439
I don't know
what made you think

10:41.441 --> 10:42.974
you could barge
into my home

10:42.976 --> 10:45.310
and pretend you're
my wife's mother,

10:45.312 --> 10:47.145
but the show is over.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.480
Are you kidding?

10:48.482 --> 10:50.949
This is the easiest money
I've ever made.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.251
Oh, I'm not letting
the curtain close on this.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.953
I'll stop paying you.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.989
Fine, then I'll
tell her everything.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.158
Yeah, I was hoping
you wouldn't think of that.

11:37.263 --> 11:38.630
Cleveland, after this,

11:38.632 --> 11:40.098
you should take all
us to brunch.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.332
Brunch?!

11:41.334 --> 11:43.468
But that's breakfast
<i>and</i> lunch!

11:43.470 --> 11:45.603
I'm buying two meals
for each person?!

11:45.605 --> 11:47.539
You mother faker.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.307
Up next, we have
a special request

11:49.309 --> 11:51.176
from Rallo's mother,

11:51.178 --> 11:54.979
who is celebrating her first
Mother's Day with her mother.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.848
I, of course, have no children

11:56.850 --> 11:58.917
because I was brought up
to believe

11:58.919 --> 12:00.785
I was too good for everybody.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.053
Donna Tubbs.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.624
(microphone feedback)

12:06.626 --> 12:09.027
I know we only met
a few days ago,

12:09.029 --> 12:12.163
but it feels like I've known you
my whole life.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.832
And I look forward

12:13.834 --> 12:16.334
to a long and wonderful future
together.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.003
This song is about something
I've always dreamed

12:19.005 --> 12:20.972
of baking with my mother.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.541
"Hot Cross Buns."

12:26.212 --> 12:27.278
Oh!

12:27.280 --> 12:29.180
Yeah, she can't play

12:34.620 --> 12:38.022

12:38.024 --> 12:40.358
Why, why, why?!

12:40.360 --> 12:41.426
(clears throat)

12:41.428 --> 12:44.963
Uh, Donna, you wanna hear
something funny?

12:44.965 --> 12:47.799
I never want to see you again!

12:47.801 --> 12:50.034
First of all,
that's unrealistic.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.537
Second of all, can you throw
my jacket down next?

12:52.539 --> 12:54.439
It's getting
a little chilly.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.611
No. It's on the hook
in my closet!

Wife kicked me
out of the house.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.102
Living with my parents.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.471
Dad made me pay
first, last, and security.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.106
Yeah, I'm great.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.542
Well, we're male friends,
so I'll take that at face value

13:30.544 --> 13:33.845
and look no further into it.
Later, Bud!

13:33.847 --> 13:36.147
Cleveland Brown?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.782
I'm Dee Dee Tubbs.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.084
Who the hell are you
and why did you kill me?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.019
Holy...!

13:41.021 --> 13:43.755
Wha...? Oh! Oh!

13:43.757 --> 13:46.024
I'm gonna need at least five
(bleep) commercials

13:46.026 --> 13:48.193
to take this all in.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.633
And then the woman
you hired to play me died,

13:55.635 --> 13:58.002
so they issued a death
certificate in my name,

13:58.004 --> 14:00.638
which led to my mortgage
being cancelled

14:00.640 --> 14:03.041
and my Curves membership
being suspended.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.643
That's where embarrassed women
work out.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.146
(sighs)
I guess I didn't
think this through

14:08.148 --> 14:09.781
even more than I thought.

14:09.783 --> 14:13.251
But hey, now that you're here,
you and Donna can reunite.

14:13.253 --> 14:17.422
And our wedding registry's still
open, so there's that...

14:17.424 --> 14:19.591
No. Absolutely not.

14:19.593 --> 14:22.293
I came here to clean things up,
not complicate them.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.028
Come on.
You have to meet her.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.496
She's an amazing woman.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.365
She can bench-press
twice her weight.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.534
It's remarkable.
She's like an ant.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.936
Well, upper-body strength
runs in the family,

14:31.938 --> 14:34.305
but I'm not interested.
Now, come on. Let's go.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.807
(grunts) Hey!

14:35.809 --> 14:37.976
We're going to the courthouse
to clear this mess up

14:37.978 --> 14:39.544
so I can have my life back.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.612
Put me down!

14:40.614 --> 14:42.013
Or lift me
a little higher

14:42.015 --> 14:44.215
so I can touch
the ceiling!

14:44.217 --> 14:45.350
Did it!

14:46.785 --> 14:48.086
It's uncanny.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.655
That's exactly where
Donna sits

14:50.657 --> 14:53.825
when we're in the car together
and she lets me drive.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.026
So... how is she
otherwise?

14:55.028 --> 14:57.829
Don't know.
She kicked me out.

14:57.831 --> 15:00.098
She got a temper, does she?
(chuckles)

15:00.100 --> 15:01.165
That's from me.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.934
You wouldn't also happen
to be responsible

15:02.936 --> 15:05.703
for her being cold
whenever we go anywhere?

15:05.705 --> 15:08.439
No, that's just
all women.

15:08.441 --> 15:12.010
Well, nothing would warm
Donna up more

15:12.012 --> 15:15.680
than the fuzzy turtleneck
of a long-lost mother's return.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.115
Poetic.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.349
Look, I left her.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.952
And there's no point
in opening old wounds.

15:20.954 --> 15:24.122
It'll be too painful for her,
and I, well...

15:24.124 --> 15:26.624
I have too many regrets.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.026
Like, what else?

15:28.028 --> 15:30.929
Believe me, I'd love
to see my daughter.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.463
But there's no way
I could do it

15:32.465 --> 15:35.033
without all the baggage
getting in the way.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.937
Hmm. What if you could see
how great your daughter was

15:38.939 --> 15:40.939
without her knowing
who you were?

15:40.941 --> 15:44.008
And nobody would
get hurt?

15:44.010 --> 15:47.145
Nobody.
Except the two of us.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.012
(tires screech)

15:50.816 --> 15:52.517
Oh, I have airbags!

15:56.021 --> 15:57.822
Cleveland,
what happened?!

15:57.824 --> 16:00.992
I hit a tree,
and they gave me
this free dress.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.994
Mr. Brown, we need
to put you in the hallway

16:02.996 --> 16:05.863
for 20 minutes while you
wait to have an X-ray.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.131
Okay!

16:07.133 --> 16:10.134
Don't worry.
Edna will keep you company.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.102
Who's Edna?

16:11.104 --> 16:12.470
That'd be me.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.205
Oh, hi.
I'm Donna Tubbs.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.041

16:17.043 --> 16:18.376

16:18.378 --> 16:20.144
Drink?

16:20.146 --> 16:22.680
Now I'm falling in love.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.649
So, you from Stoolbend?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.784
Originally, but I've
lived all over.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.086

to tell you

16:28.088 --> 16:30.755

I  <i>haven't</i>lived.

16:30.757 --> 16:34.359

16:36.096 --> 16:38.429

I <i>have</i> lived.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.665
Stoolbend, Detroit...

16:40.667 --> 16:42.600
Detroit? Where the buildings
cost a dollar

16:42.602 --> 16:44.502
and they won't put up
the Robocop statue?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.037
Wow, you must have
some stories.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.806
Sure do.
And I'll start
with the story

16:48.808 --> 16:50.308
of you giving me
back that flask.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.377

16:52.379 --> 16:53.878

16:53.880 --> 16:55.947

I'm guessing--

16:55.949 --> 16:58.383

18:15.428 --> 18:17.662
but the timing
couldn't have been worse.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.031
Good news, ladies!

18:20.033 --> 18:23.034
I got you booked on the
next <i>American Bandshtung.</i>

18:23.036 --> 18:25.002
(women squeal, laugh)

18:26.538 --> 18:27.872
<i>I was 19.</i>

18:27.874 --> 18:29.707
<i>I didn't know how</i>
<i>to be a mother,</i>

18:29.709 --> 18:32.477
<i>and there were so many</i>
<i>people counting on me.</i>

18:32.479 --> 18:34.979
And-and I guess I just couldn't
<i>let go of my dream.</i>

18:34.981 --> 18:38.149
<i>So I took my daughter back</i>
<i>to my brother in Virginia.</i>

18:38.151 --> 18:39.917
Take good care
of her, Kevin.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.986
You'll be her uncle
and her daddy.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.255
Maybe you can call yourself
Uncle Daddy.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.057
Or something like that, yeah.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.864
(cooing)

18:52.866 --> 18:55.333
I knew my baby was
in good hands,

18:55.335 --> 18:57.935
but I've regretted
that decision ever since.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.937
You were 19 and scared.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.772
What choice did you have?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.608
I couldn't help
but overhearing.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.810
So, Donna,
you understand

19:05.812 --> 19:07.612
why this woman gave up
her daughter?

19:07.614 --> 19:08.880
I think so.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.982
Well, then, Donna,
once again,

19:10.984 --> 19:13.751
I gotta tell you
something funny.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.788
This woman is not
Edna Uhmalmahay.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.923
This is...

19:18.925 --> 19:22.293
Dee Dee Tubbs,
your real mother!

19:22.295 --> 19:23.394
What?!

19:25.130 --> 19:26.330
Donna, I did it!

19:26.332 --> 19:28.432
I found her
just like I promised!

19:28.434 --> 19:31.035
And you like her!
And she likes you!

19:31.037 --> 19:32.703
Happy Mother's D...

19:32.705 --> 19:34.539
(whimpering):
See how she do me,
Dee Dee?

19:34.541 --> 19:35.940
See how she do?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.642
Donna, don't be mad
at Cleveland!

19:37.644 --> 19:38.943
Yeah.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.679
As crazy as his scheme was,
I'm glad he did it.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.181
Because without that,
I'm not sure

19:43.183 --> 19:45.149
I would've been brave enough
to face you.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.184
Why not?

19:46.186 --> 19:48.019
I was ashamed.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.420
And thanks to Cleveland,

19:49.422 --> 19:52.089
while I'll walk with a limp
for the rest of my life...

19:52.091 --> 19:53.524
The doctor said "may."

19:53.526 --> 19:56.594
May walk with a limp
for the rest of my life,

19:56.596 --> 19:59.297
it was worth it
just to see you again.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.531
Happy day!

20:00.533 --> 20:01.999
Oh, Cleveland.
Don't hit me!

20:02.001 --> 20:03.601
I'm not going to.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.635
(smooching)

20:04.637 --> 20:06.204
Thank you, Cleveland.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.872
Oh. You're welcome.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.141
I probably won't put
this much effort

20:10.143 --> 20:12.710
into anything for you
ever again.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.279
Mr. Brown, we really do
need you in X-ray.

20:15.281 --> 20:17.982
The doctor believes you might
have some internal bleeding.

20:17.984 --> 20:18.950
(huffs)

20:18.952 --> 20:21.118
Let me give you
a little tip, Nursie,

20:21.120 --> 20:24.989
it's bad when the blood is
outside your body.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.024
(grunting, groaning)

20:27.026 --> 20:28.859
(grunting)

20:33.165 --> 20:36.300
I'm not asking
for your forgiveness, Donna,

20:36.302 --> 20:39.170
and I know we've got
a long road ahead of us.

20:39.172 --> 20:42.039
I'm just asking to be
a part of your life.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.675
I'm not calling you "Mom."

20:44.677 --> 20:48.112
(sobbing):
I'll call you "Mama."

20:49.881 --> 20:51.148
Wait a minute.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.818
You said you gave me
to your brother to raise.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.920
But I was raised
by Auntie Mama.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.521
Who's Auntie Mama?

20:57.523 --> 20:58.522
"Who's Auntie Mama?!"

20:58.524 --> 20:59.624
(farting loudly)

20:59.626 --> 21:01.959
I'm outrageous!
