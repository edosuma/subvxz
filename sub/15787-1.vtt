01:01.428 --> 01:02.761
Max?

01:02.763 --> 01:02.761
Max, it's me.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.200
Max, I want you
to come with me,
but I need you to be quiet.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.702
And don't make
a sound no matter
what happens,

01:10.704 --> 01:11.770
do you understand?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.396
Everyone okay?

02:26.212 --> 02:27.312
Damn it.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.617
Dad!

02:37.590 --> 02:38.857
No, dad.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.860
Ari.

04:58.364 --> 04:59.998
<i> All my life,</i>
<i> I've been running.</i>

05:05.672 --> 05:05.671
<i> It's all I've ever known.</i>

05:07.907 --> 05:10.409
<i> And I've always found</i>
<i> one thing to be true.</i>

05:42.408 --> 05:44.109
<i> It's the only thing</i>
<i> you have to remember.</i>

05:54.620 --> 05:56.555
<i> The only thing</i>
<i> you need to believe.</i>

06:16.109 --> 06:17.876
<i>No matter how bad things get,</i>

06:18.711 --> 06:20.779
<i> there's always a way out.</i>

06:31.125 --> 06:33.091
Max, wake up.

06:33.626 --> 06:34.726
I'm up.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.178
Slow down.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.480
I'm in a hurry.

07:35.521 --> 07:36.855
Can I help you
with something?

07:38.791 --> 07:39.825
No.

07:39.827 --> 07:40.892
Okay.

07:40.894 --> 07:45.797
And clean up after yourself.
You're not the only one
that lives here.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.673
You got it, mom.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.997
Good morning, sunshine.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.735
Iggy wants to talk to you.

08:24.804 --> 08:24.803
Inventory.

08:24.805 --> 08:28.240
He's been calculating
his long-term projection
all morning.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.775
Yeah, I'm gonna need
breakfast first.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.514
Good choice.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.918
You're right.
One cookie's a snack,
two is a meal.

08:46.058 --> 08:47.192
Yes.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.830
Five miles away.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.832
I can't wait
to leave this house.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.167
I mean, you've had
some bad ideas,

08:56.169 --> 08:57.903
but this is by far
your worst.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.138
Why? It's not like
anyone's gonna find out.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.807
You're willing to put
your life in danger
for a jacket?

09:02.809 --> 09:05.010
I'll be back before
anyone knows I'm gone.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.078
Are you kidding me?

09:18.257 --> 09:19.658
Really, nudge?

09:20.626 --> 09:22.193
You're up.
Don't play with me.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.764
What do you mean?
I know.

09:26.632 --> 09:27.732
Don't look at her.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.167
Get out of my head,
you little rat.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.236
Hey, leave angel alone,
it's not her fault

09:31.238 --> 09:32.938
you're planning
something stupid.

09:32.940 --> 09:36.308
Coming from
the idiot making a bomb
at the breakfast table.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.710
That's a bomb?
Like a real bomb?

09:38.945 --> 09:40.011
No.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.248
Don't worry.
It's not dangerous.

09:44.283 --> 09:47.319
As long as these two
aren't connected,
it can't go off.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.823
Oh, I see.
Never mind. Totally cool.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.025
If they find us,
they'll send the erasers.

09:54.193 --> 09:57.262
And those guys could
rip down these walls
with their bare hands.

09:57.863 --> 10:00.665
So excuse me for wanting
a little extra firepower.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.667
Yeah, well,
they're not gonna have to
send the erasers

10:02.669 --> 10:04.869
if you do their job for them
and kill all of us first.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.005
And you,

10:07.007 --> 10:10.375
were you really
gonna put us all at risk
just to go shopping?

10:10.377 --> 10:12.844
Relax. What's the big deal?
I would have been back

10:12.846 --> 10:12.844
before you even
knew I was gone.

10:12.846 --> 10:17.382
I'm just tired
of being cooped up
in this house all the time.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.351
And what was your plan
if you got caught?

10:19.353 --> 10:20.785
I'm too fast to get caught.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.220
You think you're fast?

10:23.089 --> 10:25.023
Well, let me tell you
something, nudge.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.960
I'm faster,
I'm bigger, I'm stronger

10:29.629 --> 10:32.364
and if you ever
even think about

10:32.366 --> 10:34.032
leaving this house
on your own again,

10:34.767 --> 10:37.969
I will take you down so hard
you won't know what hit you.

10:47.713 --> 10:48.880
All right, John Wayne.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.652
What are you looking at?

10:56.756 --> 10:58.189
You don't have to
be so hard on them.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.258
Someone has to be
in charge around here.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.331
Sounds like that went well.

11:06.732 --> 11:07.899
Eavesdropping again?

11:08.267 --> 11:08.266
I might be blind,

11:08.268 --> 11:11.336
but I can't help
that my hearing
is better than yours.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.172
You wanted to
meet with me?
Right.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.208
Well, uh, the verdict is
we won't starve tomorrow,

11:17.210 --> 11:20.345
but between the food supply
and the money
that Jeb left us,

11:21.347 --> 11:23.748
we're looking at
six months tops.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.851
Great. That gives us time
to come up with a plan.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.055
Like what? Stealing?
Becoming farmers?

11:30.389 --> 11:31.956
Okay,
maybe it's time we leave.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.024
We're not leaving.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.993
We may not
have a choice, Max.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.396
Change is going to come
whether we're prepared
or not.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.831
Yeah, I'm with iggy on this.

11:40.232 --> 11:41.866
I can't blame
nudge or the others

11:41.868 --> 11:43.234
wanting to go out
and experience more.

11:44.236 --> 11:45.837
These kids need things, Max.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.941
Ordinary things,
like making friends
or seeing more than just

11:49.943 --> 11:51.276
the inside of this house.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.978
Well, at least
they're not in cages.

11:54.313 --> 11:54.312
We're not leaving.

11:54.314 --> 11:58.249
Jeb put us here
for a reason.
He knew we'd be safe.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.187
You still think
he's coming back,
don't you?

12:37.857 --> 12:39.958
How am I supposed to
do this without you?

12:43.062 --> 12:44.395
<i> You're their leader, Max.</i>

12:45.231 --> 12:47.766
<i> Show them the way,</i>
<i> they will follow.</i>

13:07.153 --> 13:08.453
I'm going upstairs.

13:15.327 --> 13:16.427
All right.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.363
Where'd she put it?

13:20.499 --> 13:22.934
Fine. I don't need your help.

13:23.402 --> 13:24.869
I'll find it myself.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.538
Or I'll just
make another one.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.297
Hey.

15:02.334 --> 15:04.102
Hey.
Hi.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.308
You okay?

15:13.512 --> 15:14.579
I'm fine.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.249
I know you think
Max doesn't care,

15:19.518 --> 15:20.585
but she does.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.422
I didn't ask for
Max to be my mom.
I can take care of myself.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.659
No. None of us can.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.928
We all need each other.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.930
I just want to be
a normal teenager.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.366
I want to go out and have fun
and have a life.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.135
We can't, nudge.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.270
As much as we try,
we can't.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.039
We can't risk the exposure.

15:45.477 --> 15:47.345
Max only cares
about herself.

15:47.546 --> 15:50.381
She has her own plan,
and I'm tired of
sticking to it.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.518
You're wrong if you think
Max doesn't care.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.219
She does.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.956
Look, I know she cares.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.460
I just don't want to stay here
because we're afraid.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.030
I'm tired of being afraid.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.977
<i> What are we waiting for?</i>

16:22.448 --> 16:23.514
<i> Can they hear us?</i>

16:24.049 --> 16:25.416
<i> Maintain position.</i>

16:40.165 --> 16:41.332
Angel.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.141
Angel!

16:51.076 --> 16:52.510
Angel!
Angel!

16:55.681 --> 16:57.048
Angel!

16:58.150 --> 16:59.250
Angel!

17:05.723 --> 17:07.157
Angel!

17:09.627 --> 17:10.795
Angel!

17:46.065 --> 17:47.131
Angel.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.315
They don't want you
anymore, Max.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.351
They just want your
sweet, precious angel.

18:09.721 --> 18:11.089
Ari.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.204
Hey.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.307
Wanna play?

19:15.888 --> 19:15.887
What you drawing?

19:18.423 --> 19:20.224
This is where we're going
when we get out.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.393
It looks cool.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.562
Who are they?

19:25.197 --> 19:26.430
That's my family.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.700
Are they your parents?

19:32.304 --> 19:34.438
We don't have parents.
It's just us.

19:38.610 --> 19:39.844
Who's that guy?

19:40.579 --> 19:41.646
That's Jeb.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.950
Why would you draw my dad?

19:47.452 --> 19:48.753
He takes care of us.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.725
He takes care of everything.

19:55.894 --> 19:57.795
He's working on
something really big.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.531
He's gonna save the world.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.434
His job is really important.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.207
Do you see him much?

20:10.542 --> 20:11.742
Every day.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.748
Ari.
I have to go.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.754
Ari...

20:24.823 --> 20:26.757
This area is off limits.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.526
But why?

20:28.528 --> 20:29.627
You know the rules.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.230
She's very special.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.866
Do you understand? Now go.

20:41.506 --> 20:42.673
Hello, Max.

21:06.698 --> 21:09.000
Max!

21:15.674 --> 21:17.675
Angel.
Where is she?

21:17.677 --> 21:18.743
We don't know.

21:20.412 --> 21:22.046
Did you find them?
No.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.015
They must have had
some kind of aircraft.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.416
How'd they find us?

21:25.418 --> 21:26.951
Who cares?
We have to get her back.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.387
Where are they taking her?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.422
The school.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.490
No.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.492
We have to
go back there.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.726
We don't even know
where that is.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.529
Jeb did.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.520
Hey, look at this.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.587
What is it?

22:04.956 --> 22:04.955
Look at this.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.926
All right, he marked a path
ending at the house,

22:10.729 --> 22:11.929
and starting
in death valley.

22:11.931 --> 22:12.997
There's nothing there.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.832
Not according to Jeb.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.469
I'm pretty sure that's it.
I remember us
driving over sand.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.339
If we leave now,
we can be there
in a day and a half.

22:22.107 --> 22:25.042
Here. There's campgrounds
off of lake mead.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.078
That's the halfway point.
We'll stop there
for the night.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.946
Who knows
what they'll have
done to her by then.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.115
Angel's strong,
she'll find a way
to hold on until we get there.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.983
So what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

22:35.053 --> 22:36.454
You're not coming.

22:36.688 --> 22:37.922
What? Why?

22:38.657 --> 22:40.591
You and nudge can't fly
as fast as us.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.627
Not yet.
You'll just slow us down.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.963
No way.
Gazzy.

22:45.965 --> 22:45.963
She's my sister.

22:45.965 --> 22:50.034
I know.
And I'm gonna get her back,
i promise, okay?

22:50.669 --> 22:52.703
But I can't do that
if I'm worried
about you, too.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.839
I need you to stay here
where it's safe.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.641
It's not safe, not anymore.
They know we're here.

22:57.643 --> 22:59.143
And they left us here alive.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.512
If they wanted to take us,
they could have.

23:01.646 --> 23:02.780
They only wanted angel.

23:02.782 --> 23:06.016
I'm sorry,
but this is how
it has to be, guys.

23:10.622 --> 23:11.989
This isn't fair.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.164
I'll look after them.
Thanks.

23:20.699 --> 23:23.067
But that does bring up
the obvious question.

23:23.735 --> 23:27.004
Why angel?
Why not all of us?

23:27.006 --> 23:28.706
Maybe they know
what she can do.

23:29.741 --> 23:30.841
How?

23:30.843 --> 23:35.045
Well, we always
assumed they got Jeb.
So maybe they got him to talk.

23:35.514 --> 23:36.814
Why would they wait
this long?

23:37.616 --> 23:39.183
Maybe that's how long it took
to break him.

23:39.851 --> 23:39.850
You guys
should get going.

23:39.852 --> 23:43.487
I'll put together
some supplies for the road.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.889
Thanks.
Yeah.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.824
There's one other thing.

23:47.893 --> 23:50.494
The guy who knocked
me out, it was Ari.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.597
How is that even possible?
I know.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.466
I barely
recognized him, but...

23:59.204 --> 24:01.071
I can't believe
they turned him into
an eraser.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.941
Well, they did.
And we're gonna
have to deal with it.

25:12.611 --> 25:13.911
Where's Ari?

26:08.133 --> 26:09.266
What are you doing in here?

26:10.168 --> 26:11.902
Ever wonder who
your parents are?

26:12.938 --> 26:14.638
We're not
supposed to be in here.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.640
Says who? Max?

26:17.075 --> 26:18.208
I don't see her around.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.178
Look,
there's all these documents,

26:21.180 --> 26:23.047
medical records,
personal information.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.616
I think they're about us.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.651
There's no names,
only numbers,

26:27.653 --> 26:29.253
but we can match 'em up
by our ages.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.059
I think this one's about me,
about where I came from.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.197
What do you mean
where you came from?

26:40.199 --> 26:41.699
I thought we were
test tube babies.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.000
Not according to this.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.071
Wait, seriously?

26:47.639 --> 26:49.707
There's a name
along with an address
in New York.

26:51.142 --> 26:54.745
I think... I think
it might be my mother.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.756
Iggy...

27:10.962 --> 27:12.229
Over here.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.941
You're getting warmer, iggy.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.714
Who's there?

27:31.883 --> 27:33.083
Where's Max?

27:39.991 --> 27:42.693
What was that? Wait.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.010
No!

28:14.292 --> 28:15.826
Now, where are you?

28:18.296 --> 28:19.897
You want to play games?

28:21.766 --> 28:22.833
Okay.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.179
Is everyone all right?
I think so.

29:09.447 --> 29:11.148
Nudge? Nudge?

29:12.050 --> 29:15.119
Whatever I said
about making a bomb,
i take it back.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.123
We need to find Max.

29:24.295 --> 29:25.829
Come on.

31:21.112 --> 31:24.214
We need more data.
I recommend
we increase the voltage.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.284
That's enough for now.
Let her rest.

33:06.517 --> 33:08.118
We shouldn't have
stopped yet.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.553
We need to eat
and we need to rest.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.221
We're no good
to angel otherwise.

33:11.223 --> 33:14.591
I know. You're right.
I just keep thinking about

33:14.593 --> 33:15.659
how she's all alone
and that they...

33:15.661 --> 33:17.027
Stop.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.596
Imagining the worst
won't get us there
any faster.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.403
Thanks.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.498
It's so quiet here.
It's weird.

33:56.467 --> 33:57.634
Yeah.

33:58.603 --> 34:00.170
It gives you time to think.

34:01.172 --> 34:02.272
About what?

34:04.375 --> 34:05.542
Anything you want.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.112
Let go of me!

34:10.380 --> 34:11.581
Just, stop!

34:12.583 --> 34:14.184
- Get away!
- Hey, get back here!

34:14.418 --> 34:15.786
No.
Yes.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.254
We don't have time for this.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.556
It's one guy.
It'll take five minutes,
tops.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.690
We're supposed to be keeping
a low profile,

34:21.693 --> 34:23.493
not drawing attention
to ourselves, remember?

34:23.728 --> 34:26.696
By the time he realizes
what's going on,
we'll be long gone.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.067
You don't know that.
You can't just jump in
without thinking.

34:30.301 --> 34:31.435
Not this time.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.536
You need to choose, Max.
Us or them?

34:33.804 --> 34:35.304
Well, I can't think
like that.

34:35.306 --> 34:38.074
You don't want to
think like that,
but it's the truth.

34:38.376 --> 34:39.708
I know you feel
helpless right now,

34:39.710 --> 34:39.708
and I know you want to
do something,

34:39.710 --> 34:43.813
but saving one random girl
who could probably
take care of herself

34:43.815 --> 34:45.581
is not gonna bring
angel back.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.754
Fine. You're right.
It's not our problem.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.768
Let go of me! Stop it!

35:05.203 --> 35:06.269
Get off!

35:07.205 --> 35:09.206
Hey, get back here!
Jake, stop!

35:12.578 --> 35:15.579
Jake, stop!
You shouldn't have done that!

35:15.581 --> 35:18.315
Get off of me!
Stop! Get off!

35:18.317 --> 35:19.549
Get off! Help!

35:27.558 --> 35:28.792
Go!

35:31.329 --> 35:32.729
You're dead.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.604
Make sure you tell
your friends you were
beat up by a girl.

35:47.745 --> 35:48.912
Really?

35:52.483 --> 35:53.617
What are you?

35:54.585 --> 35:55.719
Oh, my god.

35:57.221 --> 35:58.855
Oh, boy.

36:14.205 --> 36:15.305
Max!

36:17.341 --> 36:19.309
Oh, no, no, no.

36:19.744 --> 36:21.211
Hang on, Max.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.447
She needs to go
to the hospital.

36:25.816 --> 36:27.284
No hospital.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.752
My mom's a doctor.
She can help her.

36:30.621 --> 36:31.855
No one can know about us.

36:32.523 --> 36:33.757
I understand.

36:33.759 --> 36:37.194
It's only a few blocks.
Come on. Come on, hurry.

36:53.678 --> 36:54.978
I'm gonna go get my mom.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.915
It's gonna be okay.
Stay with me.

37:01.419 --> 37:06.523
All right. What do we got?
Come on. Max?

37:07.692 --> 37:10.360
Stay with me. Max?

37:13.431 --> 37:14.731
Max.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.800
Damn it.

37:16.802 --> 37:20.370
You're so stupid.
Why do you not listen to me?

37:20.838 --> 37:22.339
You're selfish.

37:23.374 --> 37:24.774
It's gonna be okay. Come on.

37:26.644 --> 37:28.511
We'll get you
fixed up, Max.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.547
Like nothing ever happened.

37:32.350 --> 37:33.583
Max.

37:34.852 --> 37:36.386
Damn it, Max.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.623
- What's going on?
- Come in here.

37:40.458 --> 37:41.691
Come on.
What's going on, Ella?

37:41.693 --> 37:43.026
Just get in here, mom.

37:44.495 --> 37:45.762
What happened to her?

37:46.664 --> 37:47.964
She's been shot.

37:48.966 --> 37:50.267
Mom, we have to help her.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.937
But we can't call the police,
and we can't take her
to the hospital.

37:54.639 --> 37:56.373
That's not how this works.

37:57.041 --> 37:59.976
Please.
Mom, she saved my life.

38:03.314 --> 38:04.748
I don't know
what's going on here,

38:04.750 --> 38:06.316
but I can tell you
i don't like it.

38:08.886 --> 38:10.387
Not at all.

38:23.534 --> 38:24.801
Is she gonna be okay?

38:37.715 --> 38:39.482
<i> Mom, she saved my life.</i>

38:40.318 --> 38:41.384
We're almost there.

38:41.386 --> 38:42.886
What are you doing to me?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.688
Her heart's
beating too fast.

38:44.690 --> 38:45.922
We need to slow it down.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.657
Where's Jeb? Where is he?
I wanna see him.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.359
Code purple.
She's starting to panic.

38:50.594 --> 38:51.928
You need to calm down.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.331
Please,
you don't have to do this.
I'm sorry.

38:55.399 --> 38:58.735
Please. It wasn't my fault.
He started it. Please!

38:59.704 --> 39:01.104
A little help here, please?

39:01.772 --> 39:04.841
What are you doing?
Stop! Please!

39:04.843 --> 39:04.841
It's all
going to be just fine.

39:04.843 --> 39:08.078
When I get out of here,
you're going to be sorry!

39:08.080 --> 39:09.913
You need to calm down.

39:10.881 --> 39:11.948
Hurry.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.883
Get off of me.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.086
- Hold her down.
- I'm trying.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.123
Calm down.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.391
- No!
- Hurry!

39:21.393 --> 39:24.694
Everything's
going to be just fine.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.929
Keep her immobile.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.497
Now take deep breaths.

39:27.499 --> 39:28.932
You need to
calm her down.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.433
Keep breathing.

39:30.435 --> 39:31.901
Her heart rate
is increasing.

39:32.903 --> 39:34.604
Calm down.

39:35.573 --> 39:36.840
We need a sedative.

39:36.842 --> 39:37.907
Got it.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.075
No! Get off of me!

39:39.077 --> 39:40.477
Calm down.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.619
That's it, deep breaths.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.790
Everything will be just fine.

39:53.792 --> 39:54.858
Okay.

39:55.693 --> 39:57.794
I just wanna be normal.

41:22.213 --> 41:25.114
Um, I don't really know
what would have happened

41:25.116 --> 41:26.249
if you weren't there.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.986
At least stay for breakfast.

41:31.021 --> 41:32.622
My mom really
wants to meet you.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.025
Okay.

41:39.698 --> 41:42.765
Okay, this one's,
like, a little well-done,
but here you go.

41:47.239 --> 41:50.740
Okay, I don't get it.
Where do you put it all?

41:51.542 --> 41:53.209
I have a really
fast metabolism.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.512
Hey, girls. Laundry done.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.213
Thank you, mom.
Yep.

41:58.215 --> 41:58.214
I washed your clothes.

41:58.216 --> 42:02.218
The shirt was a loss,
but you and Ella
are the same size.

42:03.988 --> 42:06.656
Um, after breakfast,
why don't you go up
and take a shower?

42:06.857 --> 42:08.525
I'll meet you in the clinic
when you're done.

42:09.827 --> 42:11.261
I need to have
another look at you.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.907
They are stopping
in lake mead,
we'll be right behind them.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.277
There's a cabin
just north of there.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.847
Pick up the pace
so that we can catch them
before they leave.

42:31.949 --> 42:33.116
It's a solid plan.

42:33.118 --> 42:34.951
I don't see any
other alternative,

42:34.953 --> 42:37.554
unless you got
some bright idea.

42:38.188 --> 42:39.556
She's gone.
What?

42:46.297 --> 42:47.964
Seriously, nudge?

42:50.635 --> 42:51.834
Come on.
But I just...

42:56.140 --> 42:58.274
Never, never do that again.

42:58.276 --> 42:59.842
I was just looking.

42:59.844 --> 43:01.177
We didn't know
where you were.

43:04.014 --> 43:06.215
You're right.
You do heal fast.

43:07.017 --> 43:07.016
What do you mean?

43:07.018 --> 43:11.354
As far as I can tell,
your shoulder
is nearly fully recovered.

43:21.799 --> 43:23.132
Did you know
that was there?

43:25.002 --> 43:26.202
No, what is it?

43:26.904 --> 43:28.738
I would say it looks like
a tracking chip.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.240
Like the kind
people put inside their pets.

43:31.909 --> 43:33.076
Can you get it out?

43:33.778 --> 43:37.046
It must have been put in
when you were very little.

43:38.215 --> 43:40.049
Your muscles, nerves,

43:40.051 --> 43:42.752
even your blood vessels,
have grown
completely around it.

43:44.154 --> 43:46.756
If I tried,
I'm afraid you'd lose
use of your hand.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.626
Then there's this.

43:50.894 --> 43:52.629
You see this long,
curved line?

43:53.797 --> 43:54.998
It looks like bone.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.002
Secondary skeletal system
underneath your muscle tissue.

44:00.004 --> 44:01.771
Which just
doesn't make any sense.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.342
The scar on your back.

44:07.011 --> 44:08.144
That was recent.

44:08.779 --> 44:08.778
Very recent.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.716
Layered over and over again
in the exact same place.

44:15.419 --> 44:18.321
Look, I don't know
what kind of
trouble you're in.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.657
I'm not sure
if I even want to know.

44:22.259 --> 44:24.761
But you're a brave girl,
and we owe you.

44:25.429 --> 44:27.230
And we'll always
be here for you.

44:28.198 --> 44:29.699
No questions asked.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.235
Thank you.

44:33.303 --> 44:33.302
Uh...

44:33.304 --> 44:38.074
I don't feel very good.
Do you mind
if I just go and rest?

44:38.342 --> 44:40.677
Of course.
We can talk later.

45:41.071 --> 45:42.739
This isn't gonna work.

46:20.244 --> 46:21.978
You can hurry up.

46:28.185 --> 46:29.252
What?

46:30.320 --> 46:31.921
Let's go. Come on.

46:40.364 --> 46:43.065
I didn't mean for you
to walk ahead of me.

46:43.067 --> 46:45.134
I just meant, like, you know,
you can walk next to me.

46:50.474 --> 46:52.074
You say something?

46:54.144 --> 46:55.545
Okay, I'm the one
that should be mad at you,

46:55.547 --> 46:57.346
not you being mad at me.

48:08.619 --> 48:10.186
Let's try
to find some power.

48:26.169 --> 48:28.304
Well, I got power outside,
but I don't have power inside.

48:29.373 --> 48:30.940
I found some candles.

48:35.612 --> 48:36.946
How's your shoulder?

48:38.148 --> 48:39.215
It's fine.

48:42.519 --> 48:43.920
Seriously?

48:45.122 --> 48:46.522
That's all you're gonna say?

48:49.192 --> 48:50.459
What do you
want me to say?

48:51.261 --> 48:53.229
Well, you're obviously
still mad at me.

48:57.167 --> 48:58.367
Yeah, I am.

48:59.136 --> 49:00.403
I have every right to be.

49:01.204 --> 49:02.705
He caught me off guard.

49:04.174 --> 49:06.175
I'm sorry for all the time
and trouble it cost us,

49:06.177 --> 49:07.643
but I'm not sorry
that I helped her.

49:09.112 --> 49:10.579
It was the right thing to do.

49:12.316 --> 49:12.315
The right thing to do?

49:12.317 --> 49:16.953
Max, we're beyond worrying
about the right thing to do.

49:18.355 --> 49:20.957
They experimented
on us like lab rats.

49:22.059 --> 49:24.493
And now we have to run,
hide and fight

49:25.262 --> 49:27.496
every day
just to stay alive.

49:28.465 --> 49:30.266
And you're willing
to risk angel's life,

49:31.034 --> 49:32.501
yourself, everything,

49:33.270 --> 49:34.470
just because it's
the right thing to do?

49:34.472 --> 49:35.538
Yes.

49:35.540 --> 49:39.342
Because if I don't,
that means
I'm exactly like them.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.644
Well, if we
want to survive,

49:41.646 --> 49:43.679
we have to be
just as ruthless.

49:45.048 --> 49:46.349
That doesn't work for me.

49:46.351 --> 49:49.385
If I can't be better,
then I should
just give up now.

49:49.586 --> 49:52.188
Maybe you should.
You'd live a lot longer.

49:57.594 --> 49:59.161
I almost lost you.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.263
Do you understand that?

50:02.599 --> 50:04.433
Do you understand
how that feels?

50:18.081 --> 50:19.382
There's someone out there.

50:35.165 --> 50:36.766
It's nice to see you, too.
Iggy,

50:37.534 --> 50:39.468
why aren't you
back at the house?
Max!

50:41.405 --> 50:43.239
It's a long story.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.108
The house is gone.

50:46.476 --> 50:46.475
I kinda blew it up.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.046
I guess it's not
that long of a story.

50:50.048 --> 50:51.414
You have to be kidding me.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.082
It's not his fault, Max.

50:53.383 --> 50:56.118
There was an eraser.
Gazzy saved our lives.

50:56.386 --> 50:57.520
We think it was Ari.

50:57.522 --> 51:00.523
What did he want?
He was looking for you.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.326
All right,
let's get inside.

51:47.170 --> 51:49.572
So far,
her physical responses,
though extraordinary,

51:49.574 --> 51:51.273
are no different
than the other subjects.

51:52.209 --> 51:54.376
Since we took subject 11,

51:55.178 --> 51:57.513
the others all have
increased levels of stress,

51:57.515 --> 51:59.348
expected under
the circumstances.

52:00.417 --> 52:03.586
But despite extensive testing
and a brain biopsy,

52:03.588 --> 52:05.654
we're still unable to find
the source of the variance.

52:06.189 --> 52:07.656
Here and here.

52:09.226 --> 52:10.292
Then so be it.

52:11.628 --> 52:13.596
We devise a new
series of tests.

52:15.332 --> 52:17.766
Yes. Of course, sir.

52:35.452 --> 52:37.286
She said it was
a tracking chip,

52:37.487 --> 52:38.888
but I guess if he didn't
know where I was,

52:38.890 --> 52:40.422
it must not work anymore.

52:41.191 --> 52:42.458
Or it's not a tracking chip.

52:42.859 --> 52:44.193
What else could it be?

52:46.696 --> 52:48.564
Well, we can't worry
about it right now.

52:49.699 --> 52:50.933
You said Ari came back?

52:51.768 --> 52:52.868
Yeah.

52:53.236 --> 52:54.637
He had that same scar.

52:56.406 --> 52:57.706
Max is the one
that gave it to him.

52:57.708 --> 53:01.177
He used to poke at her
while she was in the cage,
but...

53:01.945 --> 53:03.712
There was nothing I could do
to stop him.

53:06.316 --> 53:07.650
Why didn't you tell Jeb?

53:07.652 --> 53:09.285
Ari was Jeb's son,

53:09.287 --> 53:11.887
and I was nobody.
I didn't think
anyone would care.

53:12.589 --> 53:13.956
So, how'd you
give him the scar?

53:15.192 --> 53:16.325
It doesn't matter.

53:18.261 --> 53:19.895
She grabbed his arm,
pulled him up to the bars,

53:19.897 --> 53:24.266
and then took
the scissors he was using
and turned it around on him.

53:25.435 --> 53:26.702
Whoa!

53:26.903 --> 53:28.604
I think he hated all of us.

53:29.272 --> 53:31.907
The only reason
Ari came to the lab
was to see Jeb,

53:32.809 --> 53:34.543
and he spent
all his time with us.

53:35.378 --> 53:36.712
He spent
all his time with you.

53:39.449 --> 53:39.448
You were his favorite.

53:41.284 --> 53:43.219
Maybe that's why
Ari became an eraser.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.287
To be more like us.

53:45.855 --> 53:47.456
Erasers
are nothing like us.

53:48.458 --> 53:50.492
They don't keep erasers
locked away in cages.

53:51.862 --> 53:53.495
I hope he died in the blast.

53:55.332 --> 53:57.466
Yeah, well, I don't think
we got that lucky.

54:00.770 --> 54:02.504
We should all get some rest.

54:02.906 --> 54:04.540
We have a big day
ahead of us.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.392
What are you
doing here again?

55:01.031 --> 55:02.464
Does it bother you?

55:03.700 --> 55:05.301
I can't figure it out,

55:05.835 --> 55:07.536
why dad likes you so much.

55:09.673 --> 55:12.808
Because there's nothing
special about you.

55:13.910 --> 55:16.779
You're just
a bunch of chemicals
somebody cooked up in a lab.

55:21.318 --> 55:24.386
If he wanted to,
he could make 100 of you.

55:26.489 --> 55:28.857
The truth is,
you're a mistake.

55:29.592 --> 55:31.527
An experiment gone wrong.

55:33.363 --> 55:34.897
You're not even human.

55:38.068 --> 55:41.537
How does it feel
to be a monster?

55:43.773 --> 55:46.875
Things would be so much better
if you would just go away.

55:48.078 --> 55:49.578
Would you like that?

55:51.748 --> 55:54.450
Then we would never
have to see each other
again, right?

55:55.819 --> 55:59.388
I mean I could
leave you in here
with no hope.

56:00.957 --> 56:03.992
Or I could just let you go.

56:08.465 --> 56:09.765
Come and get it.

56:11.134 --> 56:12.501
Come and get it.

57:51.968 --> 57:53.869
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

57:53.871 --> 57:55.204
I've been
looking forward to this.

57:55.805 --> 57:57.606
Well, I wouldn't
want to disappoint you.

58:03.046 --> 58:04.746
Well, I guess
if you still hate me,

58:04.748 --> 58:05.948
you still have
feelings, huh?

58:05.950 --> 58:10.085
I was wondering about that.
Are you still a person
or just an animal?

58:10.087 --> 58:11.620
I didn't come here to talk.

58:15.091 --> 58:17.993
Come on, Ari.
Jeb wouldn't want it
to be like this.

58:20.230 --> 58:23.665
You still don't get anything!

58:24.100 --> 58:25.968
We're the good guys.

58:40.850 --> 58:43.886
Come on, Ari.
You should know better.
I'm never really alone.

58:45.923 --> 58:47.189
Neither am I.

58:51.895 --> 58:54.096
You chose
to become a monster.

58:54.697 --> 58:56.198
I didn't have that luxury.

58:56.933 --> 58:59.001
And that's a decision
I'm gonna make you regret.

58:59.536 --> 59:00.836
And I might even enjoy it.

59:01.204 --> 59:03.906
Max, I just couldn't
quite hear you.

59:16.853 --> 59:19.888
Max, I don't know
if you can hear me,
but I can't hear you.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.106
No!

59:38.575 --> 59:39.841
No!

59:43.680 --> 59:45.113
No!

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:19.948
Don't worry, angel.

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:25.387
Your whole family
will be reunited soon enough.

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.233
Is everyone okay?

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:41.670
I'm fine.

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.205
Iggy?

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:44.272
Present.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.074
I'm okay, Max.

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.143
Gazzy?

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:50.178
Look.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.116
Oh, my god. Angel.

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:57.252
Angel, it's me, Max.
Can you hear me?

01:00:58.388 --> 01:00:58.387
Max?

01:00:58.389 --> 01:01:02.891
Yeah.
Yes, it's me. I'm right here.
Everything's okay.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:04.726
Max, I'm sorry.

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:06.128
I'm so sorry.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.730
It's okay, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.298
Don't listen to him, Max.

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:13.735
Please.
Please don't listen to him.

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:14.936
Listen to who?

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.223
Somebody wants to
talk to you, Max.

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.280
Hello, Max.

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:21.937
Why don't you
take a seat, Max?

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.139
We have a lot of
catching up to do.

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.023
I got you something to eat.

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.096
You must be starving.

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.299
Chocolate chip cookies.

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.302
Your favorite.

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.208
You're not hungry?

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:06.414
I'm trying really hard
to come up with a story

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.116
that would explain
any of this.

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:11.253
And what have you
come up with so far?

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.190
That two years ago,
you were caught.

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.460
So to protect us,
you pretended
that we were dead.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.062
But you knew they'd
always be watching,

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:22.931
so you stopped
communicating with us.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:26.501
But I'm guessing
that's just
wishful thinking, huh?

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:30.972
Anything else?

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.009
Option two,

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.145
that it was all a lie.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:41.149
You never really rescued us,
and this is all part
of some master plan,

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.318
the experiments,
everything. It was you.

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:47.455
How am I doing, Jeb?

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:51.193
Warm? Cold?
Room temperature?

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:57.899
Both of those scenarios
are extremes.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.535
Opposite extremes.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:06.408
The truth usually lies
somewhere in the middle.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:11.880
Like I'd believe
anything you had to say
after what you did to angel.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.515
That was unavoidable.

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:18.220
We've been monitoring
your physical health,
all of you.

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:21.289
But angel
developed some anomalies

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.991
that required
closer inspection.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.127
She's just a kid.

01:04:26.129 --> 01:04:28.396
No. She's not.

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.267
She's extraordinary.

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:34.569
All of you are.

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.339
Then why
did you abandon us?

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.579
We kept you here
until we knew
that your DNA was stable.

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:47.549
I brought you to
the house so you could

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:49.117
develop physically
and emotionally,

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:52.520
and then I left.

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:55.891
So you could
learn independence.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:00.195
It's the same process
that every child goes through.

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.233
God, you actually
believe that, don't you?

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.303
You really think
that what you did
was for the best?

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:10.672
No, not for you, Max. No.

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:14.042
For everyone.

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.281
Why do you think
you were created
in the first place?

01:05:20.116 --> 01:05:23.285
I don't know. Maybe
you were just really,
really bored one day.

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.989
Most scientists
serve a larger purpose.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:30.926
To help people,

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:34.262
to better the world,
to save it.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:39.267
Their methods may differ,
but it's always
for the greater good.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.404
And what about the people
you hurt along the way?

01:05:42.406 --> 01:05:43.972
They don't count?

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:49.477
Variables.

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:55.317
There's only
success or failure.

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:59.087
And you, Max, are a success.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.657
Lucky me.

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.127
So what happens now?

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:09.731
Unfortunately,
now that the illusion
has been shattered,

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:11.333
we will have to
keep you here.

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.302
At least for now.

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:17.639
Home sweet home.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.211
You really should
try the cookie, Max.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.349
They're homemade.

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.393
I know you let Ari
become an eraser.

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.528
It was his choice.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.697
You could have
stopped him if you tried.

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:45.567
There are some things
in life that are
out of our control.

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:50.372
Accepting that
is just another part
of growing up.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:59.214
I don't like
chocolate chip
cookies anymore.

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.251
I've outgrown them.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.337
I'm done.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.110
Come on!

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:33.048
Get in the cage.

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:40.088
Get in the cage.

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:42.190
Or what?

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.326
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:48.797
I'm not afraid of you.

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:50.432
I don't care
what you've done to yourself.

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:53.768
You're still the same weak,
pathetic little boy

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:55.804
desperate for approval.

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:58.840
And you're not
gonna lay a hand on me.

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:00.442
You know why?

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:04.079
Because daddy
wouldn't like it.

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.114
Get in the cage.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:10.085
Get in the cage.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:23.331
Is it true? Was it him?

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:28.470
Yeah, it's true.
Jeb's alive.

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:31.171
Alive and a traitor.

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:33.841
I'd rather he was dead.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:36.578
So what do we do?

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:39.814
There's not much we can do.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:41.816
They're out there
and we're locked in here.

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.687
So you have a plan, right?

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:48.256
No. I don't, actually.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:53.361
And the thing is,
Jeb said some stuff about us,

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:56.731
why we're here,
and it sounded
really important.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:57.799
I think we should trust him.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:01.202
- Trust him? We can't.
- Are you serious? No.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.504
Are you out of your mind?

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:04.738
Max, he's gonna
turn us into an eraser.

01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:06.875
What are you
talking about?
You can't keep...

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.511
<i> No, we can't...</i>

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:12.647
No, Max, no.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.616
After everything
he's done.

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:16.451
Max! Max!
This isn't fair.
We can't trust him.

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:17.719
There is no way!

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.154
Oh, my god.

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:20.220
Look where we are.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.358
It makes no sense, Max.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.560
<i> Angel, can you hear me?</i>

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.930
<i> We're being watched.</i>
<i> And we can't trust Jeb.</i>

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:31.599
<i> We're getting out</i>
<i> of here tonight.</i>

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.434
<i> Tell the others.</i>

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:24.219
<i>How's Dr. batchelder</i>
<i>handling the reunion?</i>

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.289
<i>If you're not up to this...</i>

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:30.258
I...

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:34.362
I'm afraid he may be
losing his conviction.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:35.863
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.801
His behavior indicates that

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:41.669
he's become emotional
with the subject.

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:41.669
He's grown attached.

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:44.973
<i> Well, she'll never</i>
<i> trust him again after this.</i>

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:48.810
And I'm not sure
if he's capable
of following through.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:50.645
He's always been soft.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.714
That's what makes him good
at what he does.

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:55.350
<i> Yes.</i>

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:58.519
What he doesn't understand
is that they're not human.

01:10:59.488 --> 01:11:02.323
The most dangerous mistake
is to think of them
as if they are.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.459
They're expendable.

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:06.394
If this gets out of control,

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:10.765
we have other facilities,
other products.
We pick up and move on.

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:11.532
<i> Yes, madam.</i>

01:11:11.534 --> 01:11:16.504
If we fail here,
we need to be prepared
to walk away from a loss.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.807
<i> I don't think</i>
<i> he sees it that way.</i>

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:23.645
This program is a failure
if we can't control them.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.848
Jeb seems to have forgotten
that they are weapons.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:31.052
<i>Very dangerous weapons.</i>

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:52.940
What do you want?

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:54.342
Just enjoying the view.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:56.744
You know, I don't think
you're supposed to be in here.

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.846
Why don't I just
scream and find out?

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.548
Oh, I wouldn't,
if I were you.

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:01.783
Wow.

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:05.320
Threatening a girl
while she's locked in a cage.

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:07.455
That's low, even for you.

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:09.724
You're such a coward.

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:14.996
Max, I could rip
your throat out
with my bare hands.

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.098
So what's stopping you?

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:20.001
It's just you and me.
Prove it.

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:22.003
You think
I'm gonna let you out?

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.740
How stupid do you think
i am, Max?

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.676
Pretty stupid.

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:53.968
Come on.

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:04.846
All right,
we all know the plan?

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:13.988
Come on.

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:20.461
Nudge, you guys head
for the main power.

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:22.163
You know how to
shut it down, right?

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:25.466
Take my hand.
I know
what I'm doing.

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:28.002
You know
where this place is?

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:31.706
Don't worry.
I know where
the chemical room is.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:32.940
Come on,
we gotta move fast.

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:38.646
There's been
a breach in sector five
and sector three and four.

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:40.415
Send in the erasers.

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:44.619
Do you know
which switch it is?

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.857
Come on, quickly, hurry.

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.798
You know what?

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.833
I guess I'll shut down
the entire power source.

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:12.113
Run!

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:27.495
Please hurry.
I know.

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:38.873
How we doing?

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.617
Gazzy?
I'm done.

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:50.718
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:57.718
This is the end.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:09.230
You're never
leaving this place alive.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:11.299
There's no way out, Max.

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:18.973
There's always a way out.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:54.709
Ari!

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.241
Max. Don't.

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:30.311
You're not ready.

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.248
You don't understand
what's happening, Max.

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.384
Trust me.

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:38.819
Never again.

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.655
Max, please!

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:49.964
And don't bother
looking for us, Jeb.
This experiment's over.

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:26.067
You came.
Of course, I came.

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.736
I'll always come for you
no matter what.

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:30.838
You scared me to death.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.307
So what now?

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:38.179
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:44.985
Max.

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:47.488
Max.

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:49.390
What's wrong? Max?

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.445
Hey, you're back.

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:47.381
What the hell happened?

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:49.784
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:51.919
Are you okay?

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:54.421
Yeah.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.056
I think so.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.893
I thought I lost you again.

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:01.195
You got to stop
doing that to me.

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:03.798
I'll work on it.

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:10.171
I thought you were blind.

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:11.405
Your breathing changed.

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:15.342
What happened?

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:17.111
It looked like
you were having a seizure.

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:19.480
Yeah, you were shaking
and mumbling and stuff.

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:25.519
My head felt like
it was gonna explode,
and then I saw things.

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:26.954
What kind of things?

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:29.223
Images, New York City.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:31.959
There was this building
filled with files,

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:34.495
and one of them
had my name on it.

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.897
New York?

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:40.601
What do you think it means?

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.536
I don't know.
It was like a memory,

01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:44.138
but I've never
been there before.

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:46.006
We should go.

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:47.942
Sounds like a trap.

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:49.143
No, she's right.

01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:52.346
We need answers,
and this is the first clue
we've ever had.

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:52.580
It couldn't hurt.

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:56.517
It's not like we have
anywhere else to go.

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.265
<i> So,</i>
<i> we're going to New York.</i>

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:20.541
<i> And don't bother</i>
<i> looking for us, Jeb.</i>
<i> This experiment's over.</i>

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:26.213
<i> And don't bother</i>
<i> looking for us, Jeb.</i>
<i> This experiment's over.</i>

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:31.352
<i> And don't bother</i>
<i> looking for us, Jeb.</i>
<i> This experiment's over.</i>

01:21:32.455 --> 01:21:34.188
<i> This experiment's over.</i>
