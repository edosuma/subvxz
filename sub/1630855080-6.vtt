WEBVTT

00:07.006 --> 00:08.883
Barry:
Alright, I'm gonna
time you on this

00:08.883 --> 00:10.301
because most murderers
don't wait for you

00:10.301 --> 00:12.053
to put your gun together
and shoot 'em.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.472
- Ready?
- Why can't I just leave
the safety on?

00:14.472 --> 00:17.225
- Because John will know
how to turn it off.
- No, he won't.

00:17.225 --> 00:20.395
- Look, boys instinctively
know how guns and cars work.
- (sighs)

00:20.395 --> 00:21.771
Alright? I can't have
him messing around

00:21.771 --> 00:22.981
with this stuff
while I'm in LA.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.483
Alight? Here we go.
Five, four,

00:25.483 --> 00:27.652
three, two, one.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.195
- Assemble.
- (timer beeps)

00:29.195 --> 00:30.572
Assemble it.

00:30.989 --> 00:34.075
- Sally, assemble it!
- Why can't we just move again?

00:34.075 --> 00:35.410
- (timer beeps)
- (sighs)

00:35.410 --> 00:37.495
Because you can't
outrun a movie.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.913
People are gonna see it.
It's gonna bring

00:38.913 --> 00:40.248
a lot of unwanted
attention to us.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.584
You know what's gonna bring
unwanted attention to us?

00:42.584 --> 00:43.877
Killing Gene.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.962
What's your big plan, huh?
What, you're gonna go to LA,

00:45.962 --> 00:48.298
you're gonna kill Gene,
the head of the studio,

00:48.298 --> 00:49.716
anyone else who
has read about us?

00:49.716 --> 00:51.301
- Just Gene.
- Why?

00:51.301 --> 00:54.345
Because this whole movie is
gonna be from his point of view,

00:54.345 --> 00:55.847
and that's...

00:55.847 --> 00:58.016
not the truth.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.685
Okay? And I don't want
our son to see it.

01:00.685 --> 01:01.853
(sighs)

01:04.522 --> 01:05.648
You know...

01:06.357 --> 01:09.152
I don't think that this is
God's message for you.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.530
Because this goes against
everything we believe.

01:12.530 --> 01:15.492
Killing is a sin, a big one.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.287
- And I don't think that--
- This isn't a discussion, alright?

01:19.287 --> 01:20.997
We either do this,
or we drop John off

01:20.997 --> 01:23.792
at an orphanage,
and we kill ourselves.

01:26.711 --> 01:29.047
I think you just wanna do this
because Gene turned you in.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.174
I want our son
to know his parents.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.258
He thinks my name is Emily.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.345
But he knows the real you.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.806
Lord, please give us
the strength to get through

01:37.806 --> 01:39.849
these next 24 hours.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.352
Please give John the strength
to know that his daddy

01:42.352 --> 01:44.187
is gonna be back from LA,

01:44.187 --> 01:46.022
and that he's gonna be okay.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.818
Please give Mommy the strength
to not leave the house...

01:50.902 --> 01:52.737
and to tend to John's needs.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.656
Amen.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.033
Wh-Why can't
I come with you?

01:57.033 --> 01:58.618
'Cause it's work stuff.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.370
But you don't have a job.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.330
It's a job interview.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.332
Would we have
to move again?

02:04.332 --> 02:06.835
If everything goes well, no.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.588
I have to stay home
while Mom's at work?

02:10.588 --> 02:13.258
Well, I called in sick today, sweetie,

02:13.258 --> 02:16.511
so I'm gonna be with you
until Daddy gets back.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.179
Sound good?

02:21.349 --> 02:23.685
(sighs)
Okay, I know. I know.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.728
- It's gonna be okay.
- John: Don't go.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.272
Barry:
It's gonna be alright.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.190
It's okay.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.818
- Oh... (sniffles)
- (Sally sighs)

02:31.818 --> 02:33.570
- Oh, you're my big guy.
- (patting back)

02:33.570 --> 02:34.779
John:
I love you so much.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.281
Barry:
You're my big guy.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.615
Okay, now I'm gettin' sad.

02:37.615 --> 02:41.411
(car engine rumbling,
growing louder)

Welcome to Nohobal.
My name is Val, and I...

(indistinct chatter)

04:51.624 --> 04:54.877
(soft lobby music)

05:00.550 --> 05:02.719
Hey, guys?
Hank's office is this way.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.221
I will show you.
Please follow me.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.312
(elevator dings)

05:14.230 --> 05:17.608
Val:
This is the executive floor
with kitchen, juice bar.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.360
Can I interest anyone
in something to drink?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.070
Small batch kombucha maybe?

05:21.070 --> 05:22.780
Kale smoothie?

05:22.780 --> 05:26.325
- Jason: Y'all got Squirt?
- Val: Squirt? No.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.578
- Damian: How about Jolt?
- Val: Uh, one second.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.997
- (Val speaking Chechen)
- (door opens)

05:32.623 --> 05:34.625
- Yay!
- (shuts laptop)

05:34.625 --> 05:37.211
Wow, look at what
the cat brought in...

05:37.211 --> 05:39.589
to the house! Alright!

05:39.589 --> 05:42.467
Wow! So good to see you.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.095
What the fuck
happened to you?

05:46.095 --> 05:47.680
I found myself.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.098
In a tattoo parlor?

05:49.098 --> 05:50.308
No, Hank.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.102
My body tells the story
of my journey.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.398
Initially, I went through
a gauntlet of...

05:57.899 --> 06:01.152
pain, but that pain
turned into pleasure.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.445
Pleasure manifested--

06:02.445 --> 06:05.114
(shouting gibberish)
Oh, so these
are the guys, huh?

06:05.114 --> 06:07.200
- Welcome, guys.
- Yep.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.701
We are at your service.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.287
Right. Right.
Still trying to figure out
what that looks like.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.748
In the meantime,
all of you have these.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.250
You can access the money
you're owed on the Moolah app.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.794
(sighs) All 800.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.797
Well, that's for you
to distribute how you like.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.756
(Fuches sighs)

06:21.756 --> 06:24.300
I was a good soldier
on the inside.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.468
I kept my mouth shut.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.012
Don't play businessman
with me, Hank.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.056
Don't worry.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.391
Whatever you do for us,
I'll make sure

06:32.391 --> 06:34.519
it is extremely lucrative.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.188
We can move forward
on two conditions.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.940
You put us up
on your best property,

06:38.940 --> 06:41.776
and then you find and deliver

06:41.776 --> 06:43.861
Barry Berkman to me.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.072
Barry? (laughs)

06:46.072 --> 06:47.615
That's old news, man.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.909
I mean,
Barry's in the wind.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.410
He's probably dead.

06:51.410 --> 06:52.995
I can definitely get
you guys a house--

06:52.995 --> 06:56.916
- Your best house.
- But I suggest you
move on from Barry.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.961
Okay? We have much
better fish to fry.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.631
Barry, alone, in a room
with me and my guys.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.342
That's the top priority.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.262
We'll see what we can do.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.890
Pastor Pat (on headphones):
<i>This is Pastor Pat,
and on today's podcast,</i>

07:12.890 --> 07:16.185
<i>we're gonna talk about
what it means to sin.</i>

07:16.185 --> 07:20.148
<i>To sin is to choose
our own way
against God's way,</i>

07:20.148 --> 07:21.691
<i>and we know all the big ones.</i>

07:21.691 --> 07:24.777
<i>Using God's name in vain,
being lustful, stealing.</i>

07:24.777 --> 07:27.738
<i>There's no real reason
to rank sins, you know.</i>

07:27.738 --> 07:29.740
<i>You can't say this one's
worse than that one.</i>

07:29.740 --> 07:31.784
<i>That's not really
how it works.</i>

07:31.784 --> 07:33.661
<i>Unless you're talking
about murder, of course.</i>

07:33.661 --> 07:36.247
- (sighs)
<i>- Murder is, by far,
the worst--</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:40.293
Attendant (over PA):
<i>...passengers seated in
the zones E and F at this time.</i>

07:41.419 --> 07:44.380
Gene:
Tom, what is all this shit
you put in my house?

07:44.380 --> 07:46.090
Well, I'm gonna have
everything moved outta here

07:46.090 --> 07:48.551
as soon as I find myself
a new place.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.012
Of course, that does
require me locating a, uh,

07:51.012 --> 07:53.389
a white glove moving service.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.309
- For dolls?
- They're not dolls, Gene.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.603
It's the world's
foremost collection.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.148
They truly mean
the world to me.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.692
Listen, get yourself together
and get dressed, okay?

08:04.692 --> 08:06.444
We've got a pitch to hear.
Let's go.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.987
(light piano music playing)

08:07.987 --> 08:10.323
We thought the article
turned out great.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.949
Well, Gene can't
really consult

08:11.949 --> 08:14.035
until we find out
what the film is about.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.661
Josie:
Here's the movie in a nutshell.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.872
It's a cat-and-mouse thriller

08:17.872 --> 08:21.667
between a teacher
and his killer student.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.170
Now, Barry Berkman
is the main character,

08:24.170 --> 08:26.589
but he's the villain.

08:26.589 --> 08:30.176
You, Gene Cousineau,
would be the hero
that defeats him.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.428
Tom:
Ah-ha.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.223
Well, that, uh, that does
sound rather interesting.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.807
The studio is very excited.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.060
We think we can attract
some A-list talent.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.478
No kidding?

08:40.478 --> 08:42.063
So, uh,
what do you think, Gene?

08:43.314 --> 08:45.691
You can't make this movie.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.486
Why?

08:48.736 --> 08:52.240
You know, there was a time when
I would be thrilled by this.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.534
I was a narcissistic,
self-involved person.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.120
But for the past eight years,

08:58.120 --> 09:00.081
I've been living
on a kibbutz in Israel,

09:00.081 --> 09:03.876
where I learned selflessness
and true happiness.

09:04.627 --> 09:08.339
Now, when Tom told me
that you were making
a movie about Barry,

09:08.339 --> 09:10.967
- I had my concerns.
- (Tom sighs)

09:10.967 --> 09:13.511
But now that
I've heard your pitch,

09:13.511 --> 09:16.305
I see my concerns
are warranted.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.393
But, this movie
is what happened.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.978
It's the truth.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.272
This is a mindless entertainment.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.357
You are glorifying
a psychopath,

09:26.357 --> 09:29.568
and you're
exploiting the memory
of the woman I loved.

09:29.568 --> 09:32.071
Gene, listen.
This is merely
a discussion, you know?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.739
I mean, they could wind up
making the movie

09:33.739 --> 09:35.116
with whatever
you're comfortable with.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.952
What I'm comfortable with
is this movie going away,

09:37.952 --> 09:41.831
and you leaving me
and the memory of Janice alone.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.335
(laughs)
I'm sorry, but we are
going to make this movie

09:46.335 --> 09:48.546
- with or without you.
- Well, I'm very sorry.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.507
- You're gonna have a fight
on your hands.
- DA Agent: Gene Cousineau!

09:52.967 --> 09:54.635
The DA
would like to see you.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.346
Take two bites of that salad
and come with me.

10:00.599 --> 10:03.311
- (mystical music playing)
- Pastor Carl (on headphones):
<i>Hi, this is Pastor Carl,</i>

10:03.311 --> 10:05.938
<i>and on today's podcast,
we're gonna be talking about</i>

10:05.938 --> 10:08.816
<i>is a sin actually a sin?</i>

10:08.816 --> 10:12.236
- (car unlocks)
<i>- Now, some of the sins that
we all know from the Bible</i>

10:12.236 --> 10:16.240
<i>- are pretty serious,
but others, uh, not that bad.</i>
- (opens door)

10:16.615 --> 10:20.286
<i>- Some of it is just
human behavior.</i>
- (door ajar beeping)

10:20.286 --> 10:22.330
<i>Let's start with
the big one first.</i>

10:22.330 --> 10:24.665
<i>- Matthew 5-21.
"Thou shalt not kill."</i>
- (starts engine)

10:24.665 --> 10:28.461
<i>Now, when talking about
taking a human life...</i>

10:30.129 --> 10:33.632
(continues over car speaker)
<i>...the act of killing
another person,</i>

10:33.632 --> 10:36.385
<i>that's pretty generally
considered a sin,</i>

10:36.385 --> 10:38.846
<i>but it's a little more
complicated than that.</i>

10:38.846 --> 10:41.057
<i>Because the Old Testament
tells us</i>

10:41.057 --> 10:44.560
<i>that there are sanctioned
killings in the eyes of God.</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:48.230
- Barry: Exactly.
- Pastor Carl: <i>There's also
an eye for an eye.</i>

10:48.230 --> 10:52.109
<i>Now, I'm a big believer
in capital punishment, obviously.</i>

10:52.109 --> 10:55.321
(continues on headphones)
<i>In ancient times, we know
God commanded his followers</i>

10:55.321 --> 10:59.200
<i>to wipe out
whole cities and peoples.
It had to be done.</i>

10:59.200 --> 11:01.327
<i>Those people had to kill</i>

11:01.327 --> 11:02.745
<i>- to protect
future generations.</i>
- (muffled chatter)

11:02.745 --> 11:04.997
<i>But, at the end of the day,
I, I ask myself...</i>

11:04.997 --> 11:06.707
- I'm sorry, what?
- Clerk: Oh, uh...

11:07.666 --> 11:10.711
By law, I'm supposed
to show you these pictures.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.675
Oh, okay.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.928
(bag crinkles, thuds)

11:18.928 --> 11:20.554
- Thank you.
- Clerk: Mm-hmm.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.556
Pastor Carl (on headphones):
<i>But before you get
too bloodthirsty,</i>

11:22.556 --> 11:25.935
<i>just know most killings
are not sanctioned by God.</i>

11:25.935 --> 11:28.479
<i>You can't just kill anyone
that crosses you.</i>

11:28.479 --> 11:31.107
<i>That's murder,
and you will go to Hell.</i>

11:31.107 --> 11:32.316
(bag crinkles)

11:33.651 --> 11:34.568
(sighs)

11:34.568 --> 11:36.445
(muffled office chatter)

11:36.445 --> 11:38.656
So, you shot your son.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.200
Disappeared for eight years.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.952
Onto a kibbutz.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.746
I really thought my life
was in danger.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.748
You could have come to us.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.459
But you were the ones
who were supposed to protect me

11:50.459 --> 11:52.420
against Berkman.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.922
Do you have any idea
where he is?

11:57.216 --> 11:58.801
(sighs)

11:59.468 --> 12:01.262
We lost track of him
eight years ago.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.849
You came out of hiding,
risked your life for a movie?

12:04.849 --> 12:07.643
I did not want
Berkman immortalized.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.770
I thought that was worth it.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.524
So, you found a spine
over there in Israel?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.444
I did.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.823
How'd your son
take seeing you?

12:23.534 --> 12:27.246
Pastor Nick (on radio):
<i>Hey, everybody! It's Pastor
Nick Saint Angelo again,</i>

12:27.246 --> 12:29.165
<i>and on today's podcast,
we're gonna talk about</i>

12:29.165 --> 12:32.126
<i>how murder is
definitely not a sin.</i>

12:32.126 --> 12:35.087
<i>Now, the Bible is filled
with tons of righteous</i>

12:35.087 --> 12:36.547
<i>and justified killings.</i>

12:36.547 --> 12:38.841
<i>Most of them are my favorite
part of the book.</i>

12:38.841 --> 12:40.676
<i>But how are you supposed
to know in your own life</i>

12:40.676 --> 12:42.720
<i>when it's okay
to use violence?</i>

12:42.720 --> 12:44.847
<i>Well, as many of you know,
I was an enforcer</i>

12:44.847 --> 12:47.224
<i>for the Rockford Ice Hogs,
and, in 1997,</i>

12:47.224 --> 12:50.352
<i>I was sentenced to 10 years
for killing Billy Zorillo</i>

12:50.352 --> 12:51.770
<i>in an exhibition game.</i>

12:51.770 --> 12:53.772
<i>Since then,
people have been surprised</i>

12:53.772 --> 12:56.400
<i>at my general lack of guilt
around this incident.</i>

12:56.400 --> 12:59.445
<i>- I just tell 'em it's because
it was done within my faith.</i>
- (parks, cuts engine)

12:59.445 --> 13:01.614
- (sighs)
<i>- Now, what does that mean?</i>

13:01.614 --> 13:03.782
<i>It means I prayed about it,</i>

13:03.782 --> 13:05.659
<i>and I looked for God's signs.</i>

13:05.659 --> 13:07.286
<i>If you go back
and watch the replay,</i>

13:07.286 --> 13:09.997
<i>you'll see Zorillo check
my teammate Mark Flanagan,</i>

13:09.997 --> 13:12.208
<i>putting him in the hospital.</i>

13:12.708 --> 13:14.418
<i>This pissed me off.</i>

13:14.418 --> 13:16.337
<i>This gave me
an intense feeling</i>

13:16.337 --> 13:19.173
<i>that I knew was a sign
from God saying,</i>

13:19.173 --> 13:20.716
<i>"You got my blessing, Nicky."</i>

13:20.716 --> 13:22.468
- Bingo.
- (turns of radio)

13:22.927 --> 13:26.138

13:27.932 --> 13:31.143

13:32.061 --> 13:33.145
(sighs)

13:34.480 --> 13:36.023
(exhales)

13:36.941 --> 13:38.567
Hey, Johnny...

13:39.777 --> 13:42.112
you wanna color?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.074
- Johnny: Mm-mmm.
- (sighs)

13:49.745 --> 13:52.581
How about some lunch?
Are you hungry?

13:52.581 --> 13:55.793
(smoke alarm beeping)

13:58.087 --> 14:00.548
- (beeping stops)
- (Johnny sniffling)

14:04.510 --> 14:05.719
Johnny: Mm!

14:05.719 --> 14:08.931
(wind continues blowing)

14:10.766 --> 14:12.977
Worked really fucking hard
on that.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.563
(Johnny sniffling)

14:15.563 --> 14:17.189
(sighs)

14:32.162 --> 14:33.497
(sniffling)

14:43.716 --> 14:45.301
Okay, sweetie.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.720
- Drink your juice.
- (John sniffles)

14:47.720 --> 14:50.306
Come on, everyone!
That's it, stick together.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.808
Find your buddy.
Okay? (inhales)

14:52.808 --> 14:55.894
Ah, breathe in those
Malibu trade winds.
It's great.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.730
(birds chirping)

14:57.730 --> 14:58.856
Alright.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.526
Welcome to your new home!

15:02.526 --> 15:04.945
Entourage:
Oh...

15:04.945 --> 15:08.782
Yep.
We got the infinity pool.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.619
- Entourage: Ooh...
- Yeah.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.079
And this is
the place <i>de résistance.</i>

15:14.079 --> 15:16.498
- The crow's nest.
- Entourage: Whoa...

15:16.498 --> 15:18.917
Yeah.
Now, listen up, guys.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.419
We updated your Moolah app.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.505
- We're hooking you up
with two grand each!
- (excited chatter)

15:23.505 --> 15:26.508
And Nohobal Enterprises
would like to have you homies

15:26.508 --> 15:28.969
be our security
for the new sites

15:28.969 --> 15:30.721
on Beachwood fucking Canyon, alright?

15:30.721 --> 15:33.432
Let's go.
You'll be paid handsomely.
Let's fucking go!

15:33.432 --> 15:35.517
- (cheering)
- Yeah! Yeah!

15:35.517 --> 15:38.103
(chatter fades)

15:38.103 --> 15:39.104
(sighs)

15:39.104 --> 15:41.940
(wind blowing)

15:41.940 --> 15:43.108
(sighs)

15:43.734 --> 15:45.027
And you're gonna
put out feelers

15:45.027 --> 15:47.071
for our dumb,
lanky friend, right?

15:47.071 --> 15:48.822
- Yeah, already in the works.
- Mm.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.824
His acting teacher resurfaced.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.993
Shut the fuck up.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.578
- Let me handle it.
- (sighs)

15:54.578 --> 15:57.122
We do not need any heat
on that front.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.374
Just focus on making sure

15:58.374 --> 16:00.668
your guys protect
my properties, alright?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.419
You got it.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.799
NoHo Hank:
Alright, guys! Let's check out
the rest of the house.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.635
(soft, excited chatter)

16:09.635 --> 16:11.178
(sighs)

16:20.229 --> 16:22.815
(birds chirping)

16:22.815 --> 16:25.067
Hello, Leo.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.031
Come on in.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.953
Well, that's a sign.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.498
(racks slide)

16:40.874 --> 16:42.292
Um... (laughs)

16:45.254 --> 16:46.922
I came to apologize
for shooting you.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.717
I thought you were
somebody else.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.052
Then, Tom told me
that your injuries

16:52.052 --> 16:55.389
were not life-threatening.
<i>Baruch Hashem.</i>

16:57.224 --> 16:59.560
I'm gonna be
paying back that debt

16:59.560 --> 17:01.937
for the rest of my life.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.193
Why are you back?

17:09.111 --> 17:12.030
Warner Brothers
wants to make a movie
of my life.

17:12.322 --> 17:15.075
- (scoffs) Of course.
- I came to kill the movie

17:15.075 --> 17:17.119
because I don't want
that kind of attention.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.162
I don't believe that.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.873
Well, I knew you were
gonna say that,

17:20.873 --> 17:22.666
and you'll just have to see.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.003
(door ajar beeping)

17:26.003 --> 17:27.588
(sighs)

17:30.299 --> 17:31.759

17:45.606 --> 17:47.649
(rooster crowing)

17:47.649 --> 17:50.861
(heavy breathing)

17:55.991 --> 17:57.618
Gene: Hi, Gordon.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.997
What is he doing here?

18:01.997 --> 18:04.333
Uh, it's okay.
Hug your grandfather.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.632
(patting back)

18:12.966 --> 18:15.093
You are so handsome!

18:19.765 --> 18:21.350
How long
are you in town for?

18:21.350 --> 18:23.560
As long as you're comfortable.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.062
(room door shuts)

18:28.690 --> 18:30.234
You still have
the same number?

18:31.401 --> 18:33.654
I don't.
I have a new one,

18:33.654 --> 18:36.490
and I'm gonna give it
to you right now.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.492

Sally:
John.

18:56.385 --> 19:00.055

19:00.055 --> 19:01.765
John, it's too bright.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.353
John, go nap in your bed.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.148

19:12.276 --> 19:13.819
Come on, wake up.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.196
Wake up and go nap in your bed.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.031

19:29.835 --> 19:31.420
Okay.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.963
You sleep here.

What'd your mom put in my eye?

- Raise it up. Not you.
Raise it up.
- (entourage murmur)

24:02.440 --> 24:04.192
I got a family now, boys!

- (glasses clinking)
- Motherfucker! Hey!

24:06.987 --> 24:10.740
(laughs)
I didn't even think
that was possible.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.994
But this woman right here,

24:13.994 --> 24:16.580
she opened a valve in my heart

24:16.580 --> 24:18.582
I didn't think existed.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.711
And now, I've also inherited

24:22.711 --> 24:26.047
a daughter!
Who I... just met.

24:26.047 --> 24:29.301
I mean, I'm a father!
Can you believe that?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.094
I'm a fuckin' dad?

24:31.094 --> 24:32.471
(Fuches laughs)

24:32.471 --> 24:35.390
But, guess what?
She's going to college.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.684
Yeah, I study, um,
agriculture at Pepperdine.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.060
- Pepperdine?
- Is a very good school.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.645
- Great volleyball.
- Fuches: Yeah!

24:40.645 --> 24:44.357
Pepperdine!
And she is a fucking genius.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.861
But, you?
Y-Y-You started
with that dinky,

24:47.861 --> 24:51.656
you know, sand operation,
and now, you...

24:52.115 --> 24:55.035
Well, you have an empire,
Mr. Fortune 500.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.703
Mr. Nice Guy.

24:56.703 --> 25:00.707
Mr. Hanging with the Mayor
and Actors and Shit.

25:00.999 --> 25:05.086
Yeah, I didn't think
you had it in you,
but you proved me wrong

25:05.086 --> 25:07.255
by putting
your biggest competitors

25:07.255 --> 25:08.632
through a fuckin' sand silo!

25:08.632 --> 25:10.967
The NoHo Hourglass.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.386
Fuches:
Oof! The NoHo Hourglass!

25:13.386 --> 25:15.931
That is legendary shit
in the joint, man.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.599
You know,
I was there, too.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.559
Yeah, yeah?
Oh, you know--
You know about it?

25:19.559 --> 25:21.811
- I was there with the sand, yes.
- Yeah.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.897
You did it! (laughs)
And then, you,

25:23.897 --> 25:25.732
you know,
you got rid of Cristobal,

25:25.732 --> 25:29.069
you took his idea,
and you made it into your own.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.279
And you are now doing
so well with it.

25:31.279 --> 25:34.115
I'm so proud of him.
Aren't you proud of him?

25:34.115 --> 25:35.617
I didn't kill Cristobal.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.703
(laughs) What?

25:38.995 --> 25:41.790
Our rivals
had Cristobal killed.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.124
Oh, that's funny.

25:43.124 --> 25:46.628
That's a funny motherfucking
thing you just said. (laughs)

25:46.628 --> 25:48.505
No, I-- huh?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.048
Fuches?

25:50.048 --> 25:51.800
I think you might be
a little drunk.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.427
Oh, yeah!
I'm definitely drunk,

25:54.427 --> 25:56.179
(laughs) but you know what?

25:56.179 --> 25:58.723
That doesn't change
the truth, does it?

25:58.723 --> 26:01.393
(sighs) You're talking all sorts
of crazy shit right now, man.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.229
Buddy, buddy, buddy.
Everybody knows

26:04.229 --> 26:06.439
you had him killed, right?

26:07.691 --> 26:10.110
I'm just sayin',
why don't you accept it?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.361
You're a badass,

26:11.361 --> 26:13.780
and I'm giving you
a fuckin' compliment.

That's it. Deal's over.

and your fucking men
outta here, alright?

By tomorrow morning.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.836
Okay? This is done.
Deal is fucking done.

you talking about?
- You...

26:29.921 --> 26:32.632
You fucking say
that's a compliment, huh?

26:32.632 --> 26:34.259
You're saying this shit
as a fucking compliment?

26:34.259 --> 26:36.678
Fuck you. I want you
fucking out by tomorrow,

26:36.678 --> 26:37.846
7:00 AM, okay?

26:37.846 --> 26:39.264
What if I don't
get outta here?

26:39.264 --> 26:42.017
You're gonna give me
one of those suits?
