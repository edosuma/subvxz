37:29.915 --> 37:32.382
it's a deadly 100 foot drop.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.253
Art: This is all thawed out

37:36.255 --> 37:37.787
and full of (bleep) water

37:37.789 --> 37:39.689
and there's ruts in it
and (bleep) holes in it

37:39.691 --> 37:42.192
and everything else, man.

37:42.194 --> 37:44.728
It's probably thawing
as we speak.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.129
(ice cracking)

37:47.699 --> 37:50.333
believe it or not here we're at
the end of this (bleep) thing.

37:51.336 --> 37:53.770
So I'm just hoping that nothing
nuts is gonna happen.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.338
(ice cracking)

37:57.142 --> 37:59.576
come on, come on,
come on, come on!

37:59.578 --> 38:01.811
(ice cracking)

38:01.813 --> 38:12.055
♪♪♪

38:12.057 --> 38:14.090
okay, b'y.

38:14.092 --> 38:17.193
Thank (bleep)
we're out of there.

38:19.031 --> 38:20.997
Narrator: Art makes it across.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.632
- Well, I can't say
I'm not happy

38:22.634 --> 38:25.035
to get the (bleep) off of that.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.903
(thud)

38:26.905 --> 38:28.838
well, well, well, well,
well, well, well.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.344
All right, away we go again.

38:41.186 --> 38:43.787
Narrator: And as the sun rises
throughout the north...

38:46.425 --> 38:48.024
(engine hums)

38:48.026 --> 38:49.826
- okay, buddy.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.530
Now believe it or not
we're here.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.232
Narrator: ...Art delivers what's
likely

38:56.234 --> 38:59.035
the last load for the village
of pauingassi.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.205
- My, my, my.

39:03.475 --> 39:06.576
On a one to ten that road
was terrible.

39:06.578 --> 39:07.777
Road's are (bleep), man.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.312
It's thawing out.

39:09.314 --> 39:12.082
Narrator: And despite the
arrival of the early melt...

39:12.084 --> 39:13.950
Art: Thank you, buddy.
Man: Yeah.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.086
Narrator: ...The ice road
truckers aren't ready

39:16.088 --> 39:18.521
to quit anytime soon.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.923
Art: I'm in pauingassi, man.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.524
The load is unloaded.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.094
It's this community's last load
this year.

39:24.096 --> 39:26.563
I'm glad I, I got to do it.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.566
And now I'm all straightened
out here

39:29.568 --> 39:30.700
and I'll be able to kick
(bleep),

39:30.702 --> 39:33.236
and go back to winnipeg
and get another load.

39:36.475 --> 39:37.874
(wind gusts)

39:40.312 --> 39:43.947
narrator: The driver's are
heading into the final stretch
of the season...

39:43.949 --> 39:46.082
(truck rattles)
alex: Whoa!

39:46.084 --> 39:47.283
- Yee haw!

39:47.285 --> 39:50.120
Narrator: ...And the melt
is coming fast and furious.

39:50.122 --> 39:52.322
Lisa: I can't get stuck here.

39:52.324 --> 39:55.225
Steph: Holy crap, man,
these cracks are unreal.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.327
(ice cracking)
oh my god!

39:57.329 --> 39:58.995
Todd: What in the hell?

39:58.997 --> 40:01.197
That sucks.

40:01.199 --> 40:02.832
Narrator: All bets are off...

40:02.834 --> 40:04.033
Mark: Darrell ward and mark.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.602
This is gonna be interesting.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.337
Art: Broke down
on the (bleep) ice.

40:07.339 --> 40:08.738
This is a nightmare.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.573
Narrator: ...As the action
heats up...

40:10.575 --> 40:11.775
Lisa: Oh no!

40:11.777 --> 40:13.510
Narrator: ...Like never before.

40:13.512 --> 40:14.744
(coughing)
darrell: Holy (bleep).

40:14.746 --> 40:15.812
Mark: Stop the (bleep) truck.
