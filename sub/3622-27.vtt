that guy's hair?

10:31.797 --> 10:34.165
<i>I'm sure I don't</i>
<i>have to tell you</i>

10:34.167 --> 10:35.367
that your dad's a terrific guy.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.469
Yeah. The family took a vote.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.770
We're keeping him.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.138
So, your thing is...?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.273
Advanced Cyber Robotics.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.716
I love it.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.218
Oh, yeah.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.219
You're going down,

10:54.221 --> 10:55.320
Stoppable.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.788
Not if I accidentally

10:56.790 --> 10:57.689
hit the reset button.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.857
I'm so glad

10:58.859 --> 11:00.225
Felix found friends.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.693
New in town.
Oh, because he's...

11:01.695 --> 11:03.928
And it's hard to make friends
for any kid.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.731
Oh, right. Yeah. Of course.

11:06.733 --> 11:09.434
You know, it's okay to be a
little uncomfortable about it.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.836
Oh, um... about what?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.304
Felix being in a wheelchair.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.706
No, I think it's great.

11:14.708 --> 11:15.840
I mean, it's awful.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.876
But... I'm going
to stop talking now

11:17.878 --> 11:19.444
before I say some other

11:19.446 --> 11:20.945
( <i>phone rings</i>) stupid thing.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.647
Excuse me. I'd better take this.

11:22.649 --> 11:23.481
Kim...

11:23.949 --> 11:25.917
just relax.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.952
Right. I'm relaxed.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.688
Wade.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.356
I think I've got an idea

11:31.358 --> 11:32.924
on our monster truck-jacker.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.726
Motor Ed... widely regarded

11:34.728 --> 11:37.896
as the most brilliant mechanical
engineer in the country.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.731
He didn't quite fit in though.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.801
Let's just say the top secret
government lab he worked at

11:42.803 --> 11:44.335
had a dress code.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.970
Ed, I'm afraid

11:45.972 --> 11:47.672
the mullet has to go.

11:47.674 --> 11:50.608
No! Seriously, bro!

11:50.610 --> 11:52.310
No!

11:52.312 --> 11:54.879
Seriously!

11:54.881 --> 11:58.283
Have you ever noticed how many
of my foes have hair issues?

11:58.285 --> 11:59.784
Still not sure how to find him?

11:59.786 --> 12:01.986
Oh, we're not going to find him.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.788
He's going to find us.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.924
Wade, how fast
can you spread a rumor?

12:05.926 --> 12:07.492
As fast as I can type...

12:07.494 --> 12:10.395
320 words a minute,
last time I was clocked.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.831
So, all you have to do
is start a rumor

12:12.833 --> 12:16.668
that my dad's lab is working on
some ferocious new engine part,

12:16.670 --> 12:19.537
and Motor Ed will
be totally drooling for it.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.308
Boo-yah!

12:23.310 --> 12:26.277
Oh, don't bring that weak
stuff into <i>my</i> neighborhood!

12:31.283 --> 12:34.586
Yeah! There's more
where that came from.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.555
Well, keep it coming,
Steel Wheels!

12:38.457 --> 12:40.959
Oh! Another brick
from... oh, yes,

12:40.961 --> 12:42.694
he is in fact... Stoppable!

12:43.729 --> 12:45.296
Ooh! Fast hands, K.P.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.898
Want to call a winner?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.601
Ron, what do you
think you're doing?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.569
( <i>whispering</i>): Shooting
hoops with Felix.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.706
No, but it looks like you're
really trying to... you know...

12:54.708 --> 12:55.607
Win?

12:55.609 --> 12:56.608
Exactly.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.909
You can't.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.577
Well, I know
I'm down two buckets,

12:59.579 --> 13:01.913
but if I focus
on rebounding and boxing out,

13:01.915 --> 13:02.981
I think that I can...

13:02.983 --> 13:04.482
You're acting
like... like...

13:04.484 --> 13:05.817
Like he's just a normal person?

13:05.819 --> 13:08.486
I've got to just stop talking.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.721
Hey, Kim.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.356
Hey.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.424
You know, we'd better
get over to the lab

13:13.426 --> 13:14.559
if we're going
to set that trap.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.361
Right. We'd better... We?

13:16.363 --> 13:17.829
Yeah. Felix wanted
in on the action.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.465
He even came up with a great
name for the fake part.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.667
"Turbonic Charger Valve."

13:22.669 --> 13:24.035
Wahoo!
Sounds

13:24.037 --> 13:25.069
state-of-the-art, huh?

13:25.071 --> 13:26.337
Yeah.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.605
A guy thing. Okay, Felix,

13:27.607 --> 13:28.640
you go stand watch.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.941
You mean sit watch.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.443
Kim, I'm just playing you.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.411
Dude, good one.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.946
Hey, take Rufus with you.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.080
He's a great lookout.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.949
Thanks.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.520
Why does everything
just come out wrong

13:42.522 --> 13:44.022
when I'm around Felix?

13:44.024 --> 13:46.090
I don't know but, man,
you've been getting amped up.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.926
It... it's just... I don't know.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.093
I see him in that chair,

13:49.095 --> 13:50.995
and then I guess I feel
it's not fair

13:50.997 --> 13:53.598
because I can walk and he can't,
and so, then...

13:53.600 --> 13:56.000
You end up saying the positively
worst thing possible.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.101
I have so offended him.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.336
Does he hate me?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.704
Nah. He just
thinks you're funny.

13:59.706 --> 14:00.939
Swell.

bring me down? Seriously.

that, it is sure to rock heavy.

What did you say?

16:29.122 --> 16:30.221
Motor Ed.
That's who called.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.956
Now put me down
or I'll tell Mom

16:31.958 --> 16:33.591
that you blew off
your biology test

16:33.593 --> 16:35.827
to save a village from a
tidal wave last week.

he'd called you back.

hanging with me and the boys.

but that can change

to waste his time on a trace.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.189
He's not as dumb
as the hairstyle

17:38.191 --> 17:39.791
might lead you to think.

17:39.793 --> 17:42.093
Just bring
the Turbonic Charger Valve.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.895
Don't have much choice, do I?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.063
Seriously? No.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.864
See you soon, Red.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.666

It... it's too...

17:58.978 --> 18:00.344
Too dangerous?
I agree.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.980
Way too dangerous
for you to go alone.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.136
( <i>growling</i> )

21:20.846 --> 21:22.346
Okay.

21:43.168 --> 21:44.435
This is bogus, Red.

21:44.437 --> 21:47.104
A man should not
be booted off his ride.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.506
Quit calling me Red.

21:48.508 --> 21:49.840
Seriously.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.208
But... Red.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.543
( <i>screaming</i> )

21:52.545 --> 21:55.379
Oh, I warned him.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.018
Thanks for the backup, Possible.

22:02.621 --> 22:07.024
This is so rank. Seriously.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.427
<i>No fancy</i>

22:09.429 --> 22:11.095
cyber-chair stuff.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.397
Oh, like I need
that to beat you.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.100
Got game, Possible?

22:16.102 --> 22:18.202
Oh, I came to play, Felix.

22:18.204 --> 22:19.470
Bring it on, Possible.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.538
Bring it on.
