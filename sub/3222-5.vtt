00:04.632 --> 00:07.863
I hate witches. Always spewing
their bodily fluids everywhere.

00:08.036 --> 00:09.799
Creepy. It's downright unsanitary.

00:09.971 --> 00:11.233
I can't hold them back.

00:11.406 --> 00:12.634
- Hold who back?
- Leviathan.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.799
Like Shapeshifters, only a lot more
into eating folk. Nothing can kill them.

00:16.978 --> 00:20.436
Yes. Sam Winchester was definitely here.
I'll find out where they went.

00:21.849 --> 00:25.341
You know me.
You know the kind of person I am.

00:26.554 --> 00:28.886
She's dropping bodies.
Means we gotta drop her.

00:29.057 --> 00:31.287
She killed her own mom to save me.

00:31.993 --> 00:33.290
She's done.

00:33.461 --> 00:36.555
You ever do something behind
someone's back because you had to?

00:36.731 --> 00:39.256
You are what you are.
You will kill again.

00:40.501 --> 00:42.059
I'm sorry.

00:52.180 --> 00:54.239
Karen, don't second-guess yourself.

00:54.415 --> 00:56.110
Yes, your house is beautiful.

00:56.284 --> 00:59.276
But didn't you tell me a million times
it's Rick's dream house?

00:59.454 --> 01:01.820
Selling it is how you punish his ass,
Karen.

01:01.989 --> 01:04.321
After what you've been through,
you deserve that.

01:04.492 --> 01:05.982
You do, honey.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.628
I'll have the papers ready tomorrow.

01:08.796 --> 01:09.820
Yay!

01:09.997 --> 01:11.487
I'm proud of you.

01:11.666 --> 01:12.792
Bye.

01:14.202 --> 01:16.693
I'm not good. I'm very good.

01:18.806 --> 01:20.205
- There you are.
- Thank you.

01:20.408 --> 01:22.501
All right.

01:28.950 --> 01:30.918
Ten minutes.
Holler if you need anything.

01:57.512 --> 01:58.638
Chris!

02:03.851 --> 02:05.682
Ow. Chris!

02:13.161 --> 02:14.651
Chris! Get back here!

02:16.330 --> 02:17.388
Chris!

02:32.246 --> 02:35.113
Oh, my God. Somebody help!

02:36.584 --> 02:38.279
Is she okay?

03:07.648 --> 03:09.479
Leave me alone! I said shut up!

03:09.650 --> 03:10.947
Just stop!

03:12.320 --> 03:13.787
You are what you are.

03:14.088 --> 03:15.646
You will kill again.

03:15.823 --> 03:17.620
I won't. I swear.

03:56.297 --> 03:59.266
- Somebody better be chasing you.
- It's good for you.

03:59.467 --> 04:01.196
No, no. It's not good for you.

04:01.369 --> 04:06.306
Look, you're a mess and you stink.
While you were being Lance Armstrong...

04:06.474 --> 04:08.305
- That would be biking.
- I was working.

04:08.476 --> 04:10.535
Heard of a town
called Prosperity, Indiana?

04:10.711 --> 04:12.804
- Has anybody?
- Two of their fine citizens...

04:12.980 --> 04:14.345
...died over the past two weeks.

04:14.515 --> 04:17.142
Uh, this one chick,
she, uh, roasted...

04:17.317 --> 04:20.310
...underneath one of those beehive
hair dryers at a hair salon.

04:20.488 --> 04:22.115
And this other guy...

04:22.623 --> 04:23.817
...boiled in a hot tub.

04:24.325 --> 04:26.190
- You don't see a lot of that.
- No.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.590
- It's worth checking out.
- Yeah.

04:31.098 --> 04:34.295
You know, one more thing.
What's going on with you?

04:37.471 --> 04:40.065
- We have had this conversation, Sam.
- No, we haven't.

04:40.241 --> 04:44.610
See, to do that,
you'd have to, uh, sort of speak.

04:44.979 --> 04:49.882
Okay. See if you can get this straight.
See, ahem, you're new Sam, right?

04:50.051 --> 04:51.313
- Lance Armstrong.
- Biking.

04:51.485 --> 04:53.919
And, uh, I'm still me. Okay?

04:54.322 --> 04:56.722
All right?
So you might see things different now.

04:56.891 --> 04:59.587
Uh, call it a runner's high
or some crap.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.558
But that doesn't mean
that something is going on with me.

05:04.432 --> 05:05.694
Yeah. Okay.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.561
No. Don't say yeah, okay
like "yeah, okay."

05:08.869 --> 05:10.427
Yeah, okay.

05:20.748 --> 05:22.943
Yes, sir, I understand.

05:23.217 --> 05:26.675
Yeah. I do realize this Winchester thing
has taken far too long.

05:26.854 --> 05:28.549
I'm sorry about that.

05:30.024 --> 05:31.787
No worries.

05:31.959 --> 05:34.393
I can be there in a day and a half.

05:35.229 --> 05:36.662
Yeah. I'll hit the road now.

05:37.465 --> 05:39.456
Just stopped for a quick refuel.

05:39.667 --> 05:40.759
Thanks.

05:40.935 --> 05:42.869
It'd be my pleasure.

05:58.419 --> 06:01.877
I'm sorry. I know this is a tough
time to have to talk about all this.

06:02.056 --> 06:04.889
I've already been through it
many times with the lawyers...

06:05.059 --> 06:08.153
...the police, insurance guys.
Right. I know, I know. We just...

06:08.329 --> 06:10.889
We have to conduct
our own separate investigation.

06:11.065 --> 06:12.259
Sorry. I know it's tough.

06:13.734 --> 06:17.067
Can I ask you,
did your sister have any enemies?

06:17.238 --> 06:18.296
Why do you ask that?

06:19.707 --> 06:22.437
- You think her death wasn't accidental?
- No. No, no, no.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.441
We have to consider every possibility.

06:24.612 --> 06:27.740
Is there anyone
who might have wanted to harm her?

06:28.416 --> 06:30.976
You don't live here,
so you don't know.

06:31.152 --> 06:33.586
Everyone loved Wendy.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.646
She volunteered at the church.

06:36.824 --> 06:39.349
She ran a group for kids.

06:40.027 --> 06:43.292
I was the big sister,
and I looked up to her.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.967
What about this man who died?
Carl Dunlap. Did she know him?

06:49.136 --> 06:51.434
- I don't think so.
- Wendy was in real estate.

06:51.605 --> 06:53.539
Carl was an architect.
Business dealings?

06:53.741 --> 06:56.335
If they had worked together,
I would've heard the name.

06:58.846 --> 07:01.644
Agent Sambora,
if someone did this to my sister...

07:02.817 --> 07:03.875
...find out who.

07:12.059 --> 07:13.788
Nobody was back here but Wendy.

07:14.295 --> 07:15.455
No.

07:15.629 --> 07:18.063
But I was only gone for a minute.

07:18.766 --> 07:21.826
Can't crank these things
past a certain temperature, am I wrong?

07:22.002 --> 07:25.369
If it started to blow a fuse or something,
it would have shut down.

07:25.539 --> 07:27.029
Hmm.

07:28.476 --> 07:30.467
You're saying
this couldn't have happened.

07:31.045 --> 07:33.707
Basically, I'm saying
it couldn't have happened.

07:36.317 --> 07:38.581
Insurance adjusters already did that.

07:38.786 --> 07:40.777
Thanks for the heads-up.

07:44.892 --> 07:46.154
Wait. What kind of a coin?

07:46.327 --> 07:48.818
<i>Not American.
I don't know where it's from.</i>

07:49.163 --> 07:51.893
It was wedged
back behind one of those machines.

07:52.066 --> 07:53.533
Somebody could've dropped it.

07:53.701 --> 07:54.861
<i>They don't have pockets...</i>

07:55.035 --> 07:56.696
<i>...in those robe thingies you wear.
Ha.</i>

07:56.871 --> 08:01.672
<i>- I didn't realize you're a spa expert.
- Shut up. I observe. With my eyes.</i>

08:01.842 --> 08:03.036
<i>Yeah. Whatever you say.</i>

08:03.377 --> 08:05.436
So it must be some kind
of hex talisman?

08:05.746 --> 08:08.078
- Uh, maybe.
- All right. Pick me up.

08:08.449 --> 08:09.939
Why don't you run home, Lance?

08:10.885 --> 08:13.217
- Dean...
- Yeah, I'll be there in a bit.

08:21.695 --> 08:23.026
Sounds good.

08:23.197 --> 08:25.825
- All right. Catch you later.
- All right. I'll see you.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.606
Aw, come on...

09:13.480 --> 09:15.072
No. Unh.

09:15.316 --> 09:16.408
No.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.852
What do we know about the vic?

09:56.123 --> 09:57.283
Dewey Stevens.

09:57.458 --> 10:01.155
Owner, Dewey Stevens Construction.
Biggest outfit in town.

10:01.528 --> 10:03.621
Rotarian, Methodist, tenor...

10:03.797 --> 10:06.630
...blue ribbon pecan pie champ,
asthmatic.

10:09.236 --> 10:11.568
We're a close-knit community.

10:13.374 --> 10:16.138
So this, um, pillar of the community...

10:16.310 --> 10:20.007
...he was taking a leak
before he, uh, sprung a few?

10:20.447 --> 10:23.644
The crew had gone for the day.
Site was shut down.

10:33.027 --> 10:35.996
Anything unusual
besides the nails in the eyes?

10:36.463 --> 10:39.990
Well, we're still trying to figure out
where they plugged in the nail gun.

10:40.167 --> 10:42.965
Seeing as there's no generator
on the truck.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.202
When you figure that out, let me know.

11:05.893 --> 11:08.384
So another victim everybody likes.

11:08.562 --> 11:09.961
Not everybody.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.189
Another physically impossible death.

11:12.366 --> 11:14.891
- You got any ideas?
- Cirque du Soleil?

11:16.136 --> 11:19.401
Oh, I, uh, found another one of these...

11:19.573 --> 11:21.734
...like at the, uh,
hair dryer-slash-brain roast.

11:22.743 --> 11:24.711
And I found a connection
with all the vics.

11:24.878 --> 11:27.574
Uh, e-mail logs show Wendy,
the real estate chick...

11:27.748 --> 11:30.080
...uh, Carl, the architect, and Dewey
were working...

11:30.250 --> 11:33.879
...on a shopping center project together.
Why didn't we know about that?

11:34.054 --> 11:35.282
It all fell apart.

11:35.456 --> 11:39.017
There are these e-mails, hot and heavy,
then, suddenly, they just stopped.

11:39.460 --> 11:42.088
So everybody working on this project
has died?

11:42.262 --> 11:44.059
Well, not yet. Um...

11:44.231 --> 11:47.325
They were working with a developer.
A guy named Don Stark.

11:48.435 --> 11:51.097
Don Stark? Why do I know that name?

11:54.141 --> 11:56.769
Man,
this Stark guy is really plugged in, huh?

11:56.944 --> 11:59.572
So all the players
in this shopping center project...

11:59.747 --> 12:02.511
...have either fried, boiled
or kebabbed.

12:02.683 --> 12:04.810
He could be next.

12:05.986 --> 12:08.921
Really? From a freaking flask?

12:09.089 --> 12:10.488
<i>What are you, Bad Santa?</i>

12:11.625 --> 12:13.616
- On the job?
- We're always on the job.

12:16.430 --> 12:17.829
Bobby e-mailed back.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.989
I sent him pics
of those coins you found.

12:20.167 --> 12:22.635
He says the writing
is Romanian Cyrillic...

12:22.803 --> 12:25.533
...used only
in the mid-15th to the 19th century.

12:25.706 --> 12:29.699
- Apparently, an antique Walachian ducat.
- So we're looking for an old Romanian?

12:31.712 --> 12:34.374
You know what?
Is it just me or is this really weird?

12:35.883 --> 12:37.111
Huh.

12:37.284 --> 12:40.219
I've seen this once before.
Plants are all dead in one spot.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.545
- Where?
- A bus bench...

12:42.723 --> 12:44.623
...with Wendy Goodson's picture
on it.

12:44.792 --> 12:48.125
I'm no expert, but I don't think
plants are supposed to act like this.

13:08.115 --> 13:11.175
If the Bureau is involved,
I assume all three were murdered.

13:11.351 --> 13:12.682
It's looking that way, yes.

13:12.853 --> 13:16.755
Mr. Stark, you had a relationship
with all three victims, correct?

13:16.924 --> 13:19.085
Oh, I knew them in business circles,
sure.

13:19.259 --> 13:21.921
And you were all involved
in a shopping center project.

13:22.129 --> 13:23.596
Why did that fall through?

13:23.764 --> 13:25.561
Uh, these things happen.

13:27.034 --> 13:28.399
Oh, Jenny.

13:28.569 --> 13:30.400
These gentlemen are from the FBI.

13:30.571 --> 13:32.562
- Jenny Klein, my assistant.
- Hi there.

13:33.173 --> 13:36.870
I'm off to the cleaners, then I'm gonna
stop at Beaman, Beaman and Beaman...

13:37.044 --> 13:39.171
- ...for the revised contracts.
- Hurry back.

13:39.346 --> 13:41.678
- Things fall apart without you.
- Heh.

13:41.915 --> 13:44.884
- Oh, I baked you some cupcakes.
- Mm-hm.

13:45.052 --> 13:46.383
- Coconut, heh.
- Heh.

13:46.553 --> 13:48.043
Coconut. You're too good to me.

13:48.922 --> 13:51.152
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

13:55.229 --> 13:57.424
- She bakes cupcakes.
- Yummy.

13:58.031 --> 14:01.057
Could you point me to the restroom?
I had a bit too much java.

14:01.235 --> 14:04.363
- Yeah. Around the corner, down the hall.
- Thanks.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.767
So, uh, usually in cases like these...

14:07.941 --> 14:09.602
Are there cases like these?

14:09.776 --> 14:12.711
You'd be surprised.
Uh, we start out with the basics.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.279
You have any business rivals?

14:14.448 --> 14:16.746
Sure. Tons.
You know, real estate's brutal.

14:17.584 --> 14:18.710
Well, that was easy.

14:18.886 --> 14:22.151
Heh, on the other hand,
I've demonstrated my love for this town.

14:22.322 --> 14:25.314
I think it's safe to say
I'm respected for what I've done here.

15:22.249 --> 15:23.876
And one of my real treasures.

15:27.821 --> 15:30.619
"To Don. Take no prisoners.
D. Trump."

15:30.791 --> 15:32.656
- The Trumpster, wow.
- Heh.

15:32.826 --> 15:35.954
Like I said,
success breeds fierce competition...

15:36.129 --> 15:38.825
...but in the end,
everyone here respects and admires me.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.489
Including your wife?

15:42.769 --> 15:45.260
It's just we heard the two of you
are splitting up.

15:46.673 --> 15:48.004
Yeah, that's, uh, what we heard.

15:48.175 --> 15:51.167
Yeah. Maggie and I are going through
a tough time.

15:51.678 --> 15:54.078
It's a separation. Temporary.

15:55.482 --> 15:58.645
Sometimes, you know, you grow apart.
It's no one's fault.

15:58.819 --> 16:02.755
How would you describe the, uh, issues
between you and your wife?

16:02.923 --> 16:06.484
It's just one of those
marital misunderstandings, you know.

16:07.794 --> 16:09.284
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

16:10.197 --> 16:13.997
It's one of those vague,
hard-to-define passages.

16:14.301 --> 16:15.893
She caught you cheating, huh?

16:16.670 --> 16:19.537
I couldn't help but notice, uh,
things were kind of cordial...

16:19.706 --> 16:22.607
...between you and your assistant.
Heh.

16:22.809 --> 16:24.333
Pretty good with the ladies there.

16:24.511 --> 16:27.412
- It's a blessing and a curse, isn't it?
- I'm a people person.

16:27.581 --> 16:30.744
And I admire dynamic,
confident women.

16:30.917 --> 16:32.544
Admire?

16:35.455 --> 16:40.358
Okay, look, it's true,
I had a recent little thing...

16:40.527 --> 16:42.893
...with a business associate.
That's all it was.

16:43.063 --> 16:44.121
- A thing.
- Yeah.

16:44.331 --> 16:46.128
Like a shoe or a golf club.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.425
- A waffle iron.
- Yeah.

16:47.601 --> 16:50.297
Yeah. See, Don, uh,
wives generally think of an affair...

16:50.470 --> 16:53.633
...as something more than a thing.
Yes. When Maggie found out...

16:53.840 --> 16:55.273
...she needed some time off.

16:55.442 --> 16:56.534
Temporarily.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.041
Mm. Now, if we were to guess...

16:58.211 --> 17:02.307
...that the, uh, business associate
was Wendy Goodson...

17:02.482 --> 17:04.244
...would we win the trip to Maui?

17:04.417 --> 17:06.784
No. Her death had nothing to do
with the affair.

17:06.953 --> 17:09.547
It was over long before her accident.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.623
If it was an accident.

17:11.791 --> 17:13.453
You're not implying
Maggie was behind this.

17:13.627 --> 17:17.461
No, we're not implying anything.
We're just saying you should be careful.

17:17.631 --> 17:20.395
And take her to dinner and apologize.

17:20.567 --> 17:23.001
Yeah. And grovel.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.296
Wouldn't hurt.

17:27.874 --> 17:30.638
Found a bunch of hex junk in her stuff.
Clearly her thing.

17:30.811 --> 17:34.247
The empty closet didn't seem
like she was coming back any time soon.

17:34.414 --> 17:37.577
So Don admires Wendy. Biblically.

17:37.751 --> 17:39.309
Wendy dies weird...

17:39.486 --> 17:41.750
...and the scorned wife
is into the dark stuff.

17:41.922 --> 17:43.822
While Don is just in the dark.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.924
<i>Hmm. It's kind of like Bewitched.</i>

17:46.093 --> 17:47.958
Don's the Darrin.
Doesn't even know it.

17:48.128 --> 17:50.426
A lot of laughs
until, uh, you cheat on your wife.

17:50.597 --> 17:52.758
<i>Heh, Bewitched reference. Really?</i>

17:52.933 --> 17:55.595
Dude,
Nicole Kidman was in the remake.

17:55.769 --> 17:57.794
- Redhead. Hello.
- Look at these dead plants.

17:59.973 --> 18:04.342
Oh. Kind of like the real estate
lady's place. And Don's statue thing.

18:04.845 --> 18:06.176
If she's strong enough...

18:06.346 --> 18:09.645
...just being pissed off is enough
to send some bad vibes their way.

18:09.816 --> 18:13.547
Literally kill off everything around her
just by PMSing at it?

18:13.720 --> 18:16.348
Eeh. That's not creepy at all.

18:16.523 --> 18:19.048
Bobby. Hey, it's Dean. Listen...

18:19.326 --> 18:21.624
Winchester. Yeah, very funny.

18:22.195 --> 18:24.993
So we need, uh, our kind of Terminix.

18:25.665 --> 18:26.927
A witch.

18:27.734 --> 18:30.498
We're headed over to her place
to get you more specifics.

18:30.670 --> 18:31.967
So if you could just, uh...?

18:32.672 --> 18:35.038
Ye... Thank...

18:35.709 --> 18:36.801
He's on it.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.906
Don. Keep it in your pants, man.

19:53.220 --> 19:55.654
<i>All circuits are busy.</i>

19:59.259 --> 20:00.783
Mrs. Stark.

20:01.394 --> 20:02.452
Can I have a moment?

20:02.629 --> 20:05.894
Of course. Um, would you mind
coming back in, say, a half an hour?

20:06.066 --> 20:08.762
- Bad time right now.
- It's very important I talk to you.

20:08.935 --> 20:12.098
Of course, I'm happy to.
I'm just in the middle of an emergency...

20:12.272 --> 20:14.297
...so please come back. Thank you.

20:33.593 --> 20:34.651
Sorry, uh...

20:35.996 --> 20:37.554
Restless leg syndrome.

20:57.384 --> 21:00.717
Spoiler alert. Jenny Klein's next.
Swiped her photo off a hex deck...

21:00.887 --> 21:03.481
...but Maggie is gonna know this is gone,
eventually.

21:04.090 --> 21:06.217
We gotta get over to Jenny's.

22:33.279 --> 22:35.611
Find the coin. Now!

22:41.721 --> 22:42.779
Come on, Sam!

22:57.837 --> 22:59.566
Okay.

23:03.743 --> 23:08.237
There were tiny beating hearts
in my cupcakes.

23:08.415 --> 23:10.474
There were hearts in my cupcakes.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.278
Hearts in my cupcakes.
That's never happened before!

23:13.453 --> 23:14.511
Hearts in my cupcakes!

23:15.522 --> 23:17.319
- Should I slug her?
- Give it a second.

23:21.428 --> 23:22.793
Oh, my God.

23:22.962 --> 23:25.089
- What just happened?
- You were hexed.

23:26.166 --> 23:27.428
Hexed?

23:27.934 --> 23:29.799
Who are you people?

23:29.969 --> 23:32.164
- What the hell do I do?
- You go in there...

23:32.338 --> 23:35.273
...and you pack a bag,
you get in your car, and you go.

23:36.609 --> 23:38.099
- Go where?
- It doesn't matter.

23:38.278 --> 23:40.007
Five or 600 miles ought to do it.

23:40.180 --> 23:44.674
You got someone powerful real pissed,
and they're trying to get rid of you now.

23:45.185 --> 23:48.746
In line with that, you might wanna
cool things with Don Stark.

23:49.556 --> 23:51.456
Don Stark?

23:51.624 --> 23:54.115
- What are you talking about?
- You and Don?

23:55.395 --> 23:56.862
You know.

23:57.664 --> 23:59.063
"You know"?

23:59.265 --> 24:01.028
There's no "you know."

24:03.136 --> 24:04.899
No?

24:05.305 --> 24:07.068
Don Stark is my boss.

24:07.273 --> 24:08.331
That's it.

24:08.508 --> 24:11.477
Heh, he's married, for God's sakes.

24:11.644 --> 24:12.702
Yeah, well.

24:12.879 --> 24:17.407
Heh, me and Don Stark. Ew.

24:18.218 --> 24:21.016
What are you doing?
Bunch these tables more in the middle.

24:21.187 --> 24:24.554
- Give me more air between paintings.
- Can you sign for the flowers?

24:24.724 --> 24:26.521
- I checked them.
- Thank you, Sue.

24:26.693 --> 24:30.493
- What would I do without you?
- I like helping. What are best friends for?

24:30.663 --> 24:33.928
It's just been so tough to focus
with Don, the whole mess.

24:34.100 --> 24:37.228
- Like he put a knife right in your heart.
- Yes.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.728
- Was I wrong to tell you about Wendy?
- No, no.

24:39.906 --> 24:42.704
You think I want you to stand by
and watch him make a fool of me?

24:42.876 --> 24:44.776
I love you for what you did.

24:44.944 --> 24:46.036
I love you too.

24:46.212 --> 24:50.012
No, no. The still life doesn't go there.
It goes on the left side.

24:50.917 --> 24:54.580
So, uh, we're gonna need, uh, one
centerpiece on each of the tables...

24:54.754 --> 24:56.381
...and two in the back.

24:58.057 --> 24:59.615
- Don.
- Where's my wife?

24:59.826 --> 25:02.056
You mean
the one who's divorcing you?

25:02.228 --> 25:04.856
I know you can hardly wait
till I'm out of the picture.

25:05.031 --> 25:07.556
It's been a thrill whispering lies
into Maggie's ear.

25:07.734 --> 25:09.861
Oh, but they weren't lies,
were they, Don?

25:10.403 --> 25:12.371
I made one mistake. One.

25:12.539 --> 25:13.767
I sincerely doubt that.

25:14.073 --> 25:17.474
Heh, this is between Maggie and me.
Nothing to do with you.

25:17.644 --> 25:19.043
What do you want, Don?

25:20.446 --> 25:21.845
I'd like to speak with you.

25:27.921 --> 25:29.081
Make it quick.

25:29.255 --> 25:30.313
Okay.

25:31.758 --> 25:32.918
I think I've been patient.

25:33.793 --> 25:36.489
You've had your fun.
Very creative, the thing with Wendy.

25:36.663 --> 25:37.823
But enough is enough.

25:37.997 --> 25:41.057
No, Don, enough is not enough.
Not even close.

25:41.234 --> 25:42.826
What do you want?
My oysters on a tray?

25:43.002 --> 25:46.165
- Now that you mention it.
- The fact is, none of this was my fault.

25:48.174 --> 25:50.005
Maybe if you'd been around more.

25:50.176 --> 25:53.168
But between the art and the charity
and that evil bitch, Sue...

25:53.379 --> 25:54.937
...I was edged out of your life.

25:55.114 --> 25:58.140
Oh, boohoo, Mr. Big-Shot.

25:58.318 --> 26:01.082
Mr. L-Gotta-Put-My-Name-
on-Every-Public-Works-in-Town.

26:01.254 --> 26:03.085
- You...
- Three of us in this marriage:

26:03.256 --> 26:04.587
Me, you and your ego.

26:04.757 --> 26:06.520
That was the problem, Don.

26:08.027 --> 26:10.962
So excuse me,
I have a charity event to arrange.

26:11.130 --> 26:13.189
Two FBI agents came by.

26:13.399 --> 26:14.832
Asking questions.

26:15.802 --> 26:17.030
Hunters, sweetheart.

26:17.203 --> 26:18.898
That's what they are.

26:19.439 --> 26:21.839
I can see you're terribly concerned
for my safety.

26:22.008 --> 26:24.602
- But don't worry, I'll take care of it.
- Maggie.

26:24.777 --> 26:26.972
This stops. You hear me?

26:27.146 --> 26:29.307
As of now.

26:32.485 --> 26:35.943
You're so cute when you try to tell me
what to do.

27:21.501 --> 27:23.264
Okay, now she's just getting nasty.

27:23.469 --> 27:26.529
Killing the girlfriend is one thing,
but his commemorative bust?

27:26.706 --> 27:27.764
- Heh.
- That's gotta hurt.

27:27.974 --> 27:30.772
She'll take the whole town out.
She doesn't care who gets in the way.

27:32.245 --> 27:33.371
Bobby, what do you got?

27:35.515 --> 27:37.983
Yeah? You think it will take her out?

27:39.485 --> 27:40.543
All right.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.086
I don't need to write it down.
I'll remember. Go ahead.

27:43.256 --> 27:44.780
Mm-hm.

27:45.024 --> 27:47.925
The... Wh... Wait, hang on, hang on.

27:48.194 --> 27:49.627
Yeah?

27:50.063 --> 27:52.930
Wait. Wh...? Hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:53.599 --> 27:56.534
Okay. What was the, uh...?
What was that last one?

27:57.570 --> 28:00.061
Right. Uh-huh.

28:00.239 --> 28:02.764
I'll remember. Yeah. It's fine.

28:04.243 --> 28:05.733
Hello, everyone.

28:05.912 --> 28:07.880
And thanks for coming.

28:08.047 --> 28:09.446
Most of you know...

28:09.615 --> 28:12.209
...that philanthropy and art
are my two passions.

28:12.385 --> 28:13.909
But what we've... Not there.

28:14.087 --> 28:16.954
Where is the ice?
People will be here in seconds.

28:19.258 --> 28:21.988
What we've assembled here
may be my crowning achievement.

28:22.161 --> 28:24.152
Not to be immodest, heh.

28:27.166 --> 28:29.225
See? I told you.

28:29.836 --> 28:32.031
Everything's perfect.

28:33.806 --> 28:36.832
Yeah. You just reminded me.

28:37.110 --> 28:39.101
I have to check
on the finger sandwiches.

28:44.317 --> 28:46.547
Dude, pie.

28:49.956 --> 28:52.424
- That's...
- Chicken feet. Like the recipe calls for.

28:52.592 --> 28:54.253
- Butcher's fridge is down.
- I can smell that.

28:54.427 --> 28:57.624
Uh, says the power's been wonky,
lost so much product...

28:57.797 --> 28:59.958
...probably won't make rent.
Ditto every shop.

29:00.133 --> 29:02.567
- Nothing but burst pipes and blackouts.
- Oh.

29:02.935 --> 29:05.426
He says
it's like the town ran out of luck.

29:05.605 --> 29:07.800
- So coincidence, right?
- Uh...

29:09.142 --> 29:11.167
Yeah.
We're past the point of dead flowers.

29:11.344 --> 29:13.471
What can I say,
I guess the witch is pissed.

29:13.646 --> 29:15.944
All right, uh...

29:16.315 --> 29:17.942
Better get a move on. You just...

29:18.885 --> 29:21.149
Can you take the feet?

29:30.396 --> 29:31.863
Yes.

29:32.298 --> 29:34.232
To us.

29:34.801 --> 29:36.564
I couldn't have done it without you.

29:36.736 --> 29:38.363
To us.

29:47.046 --> 29:48.377
That is disgusting!

29:52.185 --> 29:53.709
No.

29:57.990 --> 30:00.254
No.

30:01.727 --> 30:04.093
Not my paintings!

30:04.263 --> 30:06.026
Maggie...

30:06.499 --> 30:09.400
...what is going on?
He did this.

30:09.569 --> 30:10.661
How could he?

30:11.571 --> 30:13.038
He knew what this meant to me.

30:13.873 --> 30:15.363
Do you mean Don?

30:16.142 --> 30:17.370
Don rigged all this?

30:17.543 --> 30:19.272
- Yes.
- But how?

30:21.047 --> 30:26.542
Just trust me, he wants to hurt me.

30:29.155 --> 30:31.419
I told you. He's a dick.

30:33.226 --> 30:34.454
We'll get through this.

30:35.094 --> 30:36.857
You have people who love you...

30:38.364 --> 30:40.924
...and he can't take that away
from you.

30:57.416 --> 30:59.611
Fine, Donald.

31:00.319 --> 31:02.253
It's war.

31:07.727 --> 31:09.558
What the hell?

31:20.106 --> 31:21.630
Whoa.

31:23.109 --> 31:25.509
Cleanup on aisle seven.

31:25.711 --> 31:26.769
Let's do it.

31:26.946 --> 31:28.914
I don't guess she'd
do this to her auction.

31:29.081 --> 31:31.345
Obviously, it was someone
who hated her guts...

31:31.517 --> 31:33.075
...and wanted her party trashed.

31:35.221 --> 31:36.586
Don Stark.

31:38.457 --> 31:40.322
So the mister is a witch himself.

31:40.493 --> 31:42.825
We got not just one pissed off witch,
we got two.

31:42.995 --> 31:45.828
<i>- Full-on War of the Roses.
- Bewitched got a lot less funny.</i>

31:45.998 --> 31:48.364
Just like when they switched Darrins.

32:11.524 --> 32:13.185
Where is she?

32:13.359 --> 32:15.554
She'll be here.
Been throwing thunderbolts...

32:15.761 --> 32:19.663
...at each other's favorite toys.
Nothing left to destroy but each other.

32:20.032 --> 32:23.126
- This is basically ground zero.
- I hope so.

32:23.703 --> 32:26.399
We need them both in the same place
if we take them down.

32:26.572 --> 32:28.164
Screens up, captain.

32:38.484 --> 32:40.418
- Want one, sweetie?
- Shove it.

32:40.586 --> 32:42.053
We are so having it out. Right now.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.359
Let me guess. Chicken feet?

32:57.003 --> 32:58.265
Not chilled?

32:58.437 --> 33:02.168
For obvious reasons,
you won't be leaving this room.

33:02.341 --> 33:03.933
Well, you will be leaving...

33:04.110 --> 33:05.202
...just not alive.

33:05.378 --> 33:06.743
Maggie?

33:10.449 --> 33:11.541
Okay, plan B.

33:11.717 --> 33:13.116
- What's plan B?
- Talking.

33:14.186 --> 33:15.346
Now? Really?

33:15.521 --> 33:18.251
Obviously a domestic dispute.
If you can't kill them...

33:19.358 --> 33:22.919
...counsel them.
Yeah. You know what? Not my area.

33:25.331 --> 33:28.391
Okay, okay, okay. Uh, heh.

33:29.035 --> 33:31.697
Obviously, you two are capable
of wiping each other out.

33:31.871 --> 33:33.463
Right? But you haven't.

33:33.773 --> 33:34.865
Huh?

33:35.708 --> 33:38.768
Which means that you two...

33:38.978 --> 33:41.913
...you still value
whatever it is you've got.

33:42.715 --> 33:45.775
And you wanna keep that dance
going.

33:47.987 --> 33:49.784
Maybe it's punishment.

33:49.955 --> 33:53.914
Maybe it's sick, messed up, erotic...

33:54.293 --> 33:57.319
...kinky,
clamps and feathers kind of love.

33:57.496 --> 33:59.896
Okay. That's going way too deep there,
cowboy.

34:00.066 --> 34:02.500
Look, what he's trying to say
is that you two...

34:02.668 --> 34:05.228
...whatever it is you have,
you're bonded.

34:05.404 --> 34:06.598
Are you out of your mind?

34:07.773 --> 34:10.435
He cheated on me. Humiliated me.

34:10.609 --> 34:12.839
We're not trying to say
what Don did was right.

34:13.946 --> 34:17.541
When a relationship cracks,
usually both parties have a hand in it.

34:17.949 --> 34:19.507
Indeed.

34:19.685 --> 34:21.016
You're defending him.

34:22.822 --> 34:25.723
Okay, okay, okay,
look, nobody can defend Don.

34:25.925 --> 34:27.516
Right? Totally.

34:27.860 --> 34:31.795
But, uh, we get that you feel betrayed
because you were.

34:31.964 --> 34:33.454
Don't suck up to her.

34:38.070 --> 34:40.300
I was betrayed. By all of them.

34:40.473 --> 34:41.996
Carl introduced you to Wendy.

34:42.174 --> 34:44.005
Dewey covered for you.
Wendy did you.

34:44.176 --> 34:45.234
Okay, okay, look.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.735
I gotta say
I don't think Don was lying...

34:47.947 --> 34:51.007
...when he said
he regrets the whole Wendy thing.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.310
Thing.

34:54.487 --> 34:55.545
Sit down.

34:57.490 --> 35:00.186
Affair. That's right. Terrible.

35:00.359 --> 35:02.418
The only thing he regrets
is getting caught.

35:02.595 --> 35:06.190
Wendy was nothing to me.
It was over as soon as it started.

35:06.365 --> 35:09.163
She was part of a pattern.
I've had 800 years of this.

35:09.335 --> 35:12.532
- Don't make me bring up the Renaissance.
- Oh, oh! You're one to talk.

35:12.705 --> 35:14.195
That 1492 ring any bells?

35:14.373 --> 35:18.332
The man was about to set sail! He could
fall off of the edge of the Earth.

35:18.677 --> 35:20.736
I took pity. So, what's your excuse?

35:20.913 --> 35:24.349
I told you.
Nothing happened with the Medici chick.

35:24.517 --> 35:27.543
- You've always been insanely jealous.
- Oh, I wonder why.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.211
- Jenny, Wendy.
- Jenny? Nothing happened with Jenny.

35:30.389 --> 35:31.947
- She's just my assistant.
- Heh.

35:32.124 --> 35:34.183
It's true. She, uh... She told us.

35:34.693 --> 35:35.751
Just an assistant.

35:38.197 --> 35:41.030
- Is that true?
- Yes. I swear it, babe.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.360
I would never.

35:44.236 --> 35:45.294
I made a mistake.

35:47.439 --> 35:48.736
I'm sorry, Maggie.

35:52.778 --> 35:54.040
See? See?

35:54.213 --> 35:56.010
Guys. Guys.

35:57.216 --> 35:58.649
You're talking.

35:58.818 --> 36:02.584
All these years, you buried your anger
and your disappointment.

36:02.922 --> 36:05.720
Till it tore you apart.
All you needed to do was talk.

36:05.891 --> 36:09.383
And I would've missed the nuking
my melon just took. Who wants that?

36:16.435 --> 36:18.027
- Nice touch.
- Thank you.

36:25.244 --> 36:27.041
He's right.

36:27.279 --> 36:28.678
I couldn't kill you.

36:29.548 --> 36:31.448
All I ever wanted is you, Mags.

36:33.085 --> 36:35.451
I've been crushing on you
since forever.

36:36.422 --> 36:39.687
You're the woman
I wanna never grow old with.

36:40.426 --> 36:42.189
I could never murder you either, Don.

36:42.828 --> 36:43.920
It's crazy...

36:44.330 --> 36:45.991
...but true.

36:52.004 --> 36:54.097
Somebody wanna call these things
off?

36:56.208 --> 36:57.300
Excuse me.

37:14.159 --> 37:16.127
- Oh, give me a break.
- I didn't say anything.

37:16.295 --> 37:18.195
It's been a long day.

37:18.597 --> 37:19.655
And it's not over yet.

37:22.334 --> 37:23.494
Hi, Sam.

37:24.703 --> 37:26.034
Hi, Dean.

37:27.473 --> 37:28.997
- Do we know you?
- I know you.

37:29.708 --> 37:30.834
You're the dead guys.

37:31.010 --> 37:33.672
Well, you will be in a minute.

37:41.754 --> 37:43.585
Sorry. You're a bit outmatched.

38:05.577 --> 38:06.839
Don.

38:07.012 --> 38:08.206
Wow, thank you. We owe you.

38:08.380 --> 38:10.746
Good God, what is that thing?

38:10.916 --> 38:14.079
- I guess we should be figuring that out.
- It is on our to-do list.

38:14.253 --> 38:17.051
You know, uh, find a bottomless pit
and drop it in.

38:17.222 --> 38:19.190
That spell will only last
for a few days.

38:21.427 --> 38:24.260
Uh, what are you even doing here?

38:24.430 --> 38:27.297
Uh, apparently, saving your lives.

38:27.466 --> 38:28.956
Twice.

38:29.601 --> 38:30.932
Got it.

38:31.603 --> 38:34.128
- Maggie? Seriously?
- She was gonna kill us?

38:34.306 --> 38:35.967
- We saved your damn marriage.
- Yeah.

38:36.175 --> 38:39.542
But, to be fair,
you also tried to kill her.

38:39.945 --> 38:42.607
You know how she is
when she gets a bug up her ass.

38:42.781 --> 38:44.442
Gotta love her, right?

38:46.819 --> 38:47.945
Right.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.054
Bottomless pit.

38:50.923 --> 38:52.447
Ciao.

39:02.067 --> 39:04.228
Yeah. He's ready for transport.

39:04.403 --> 39:06.997
I just hope you got some place
you can put him, Bobby.

39:07.206 --> 39:08.696
All right.

39:09.808 --> 39:11.469
We should hit the road.

39:11.643 --> 39:12.940
You ready?

39:13.112 --> 39:14.636
Were you, uh?

39:16.315 --> 39:18.977
Were you listening
to the Starks tonight?

39:19.718 --> 39:23.654
Uh, when I wasn't getting slammed
into a wall or stung by bees.

39:25.958 --> 39:27.789
You notice how they, uh?

39:27.960 --> 39:30.622
How they opened up?
Got everything off their chest?

39:30.796 --> 39:32.457
Kudos on selling them that crap.

39:32.631 --> 39:35.031
Heh, it wasn't crap, Dean. It worked.

39:36.802 --> 39:41.762
Sam, I am so very, very, very tired...

39:41.940 --> 39:45.205
Like it or not, the stuff you don't
talk about doesn't just go away.

39:45.377 --> 39:47.937
It builds up.
Whatever is eating at you right now...

39:48.113 --> 39:50.047
There's always something eating
at me.

39:50.249 --> 39:52.046
It's who I am.

39:52.251 --> 39:54.845
Something happens, I feel responsible.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.784
All right?
Uh, the Lindbergh baby, that's on me.

39:57.956 --> 40:00.390
- Unemployment, my bad.
- Not what I'm talking about.

40:00.559 --> 40:04.256
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Whatever you're not telling me about.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.800
Look, Dean, it's fine.

40:09.968 --> 40:13.165
You can unload.
That's kind of what I'm here for.

40:19.211 --> 40:20.974
I mean...

40:21.280 --> 40:22.508
We're good, right?

40:23.182 --> 40:24.649
We're good.
