&lrm;Is it me,
&lrm;or does everyone seem a bit weird?

11:14.880 --> 11:17.400
&lrm;Forget about them.
&lrm;Let's go dance. Come on.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.080
&lrm;There's no way this is happening.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.600
&lrm;Lucky charm!

11:40.280 --> 11:41.280
&lrm;A record?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.320
&lrm;[she cackles]

11:55.720 --> 11:56.920
&lrm;[funky music]

11:57.720 --> 11:58.680
&lrm;[gasps]

11:58.800 --> 12:00.160
&lrm;[giggling]

12:00.280 --> 12:01.600
&lrm;[cheering]

12:03.120 --> 12:05.400
&lrm;Dude, who just hijacked my mix?

12:05.680 --> 12:06.760
&lrm;Yours truly.

12:06.880 --> 12:07.880
&lrm;[bleeping]

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
&lrm;[she gasps]

12:09.120 --> 12:11.640
&lrm;Better bug out quick before I change back.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.360
&lrm;Spots off.

12:20.000 --> 12:20.880
&lrm;Marinette!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.440
&lrm;It was an emergency.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.040
&lrm;Yeah, if by emergency you mean jealousy.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.840
&lrm;Once you use your lucky charm,

12:27.960 --> 12:29.640
&lrm;you only have minutes before...

12:29.760 --> 12:32.360
&lrm;I turn back, I know, but I figured...

12:32.480 --> 12:34.440
&lrm;The Bubbler... he's not going anywhere.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.120
&lrm;We've time to get some food
&lrm;to get your energy back.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.640
&lrm;Then, we'll get right back out there.
&lrm;I promise.

12:42.360 --> 12:48.160
&lrm;[dance music]

12:48.280 --> 12:50.960
&lrm;Gotta find a place
&lrm;where I can transform fast.

12:51.080 --> 12:54.160
&lrm;Where have you been, girl?
&lrm;I was scared for you.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.440
&lrm;Me too.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.960
&lrm;I'm sure Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;will save us.

12:59.080 --> 12:59.920
&lrm;They've never failed us.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.320
&lrm;Come with me, I have something for you.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.560
&lrm;I have to do something first.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.200
&lrm;[tauntingly] It's about Adrien.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.560
&lrm;[reluctantly] OK.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.280
&lrm;Marinette, the Bubbler.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.320
&lrm;OK, OK, in a sec.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.360
&lrm;Look... Now you can sign your gift.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.720
&lrm;Yes.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.080
&lrm;Hey, you. Why aren't you having fun?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.680
&lrm;None of your business.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.520
&lrm;Then I'm gonna make it my business.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.640
&lrm;[he cackles]

13:26.960 --> 13:28.920
&lrm;"Love, Marinette"

13:29.320 --> 13:30.240
&lrm;There.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.080
&lrm;[she giggles]

13:33.840 --> 13:35.280
&lrm;We're good. Spots on, Marinette.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.680
&lrm;I can't do it now. Alya's here.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.760
&lrm;[Ayla] What?

13:39.040 --> 13:41.840
&lrm;Hey... Go ahead.
&lrm;I'll meet you in the yard.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.600
&lrm;No! You were right, Tikki.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.440
&lrm;I never should have waited.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.920
&lrm;Hey, Paris! How ya doin'?

13:50.040 --> 13:51.920
&lrm;[crowd groans]

13:54.000 --> 13:56.560
&lrm;[cheering]

13:58.280 --> 13:59.120
&lrm;[Adrien] Ladybug?

14:03.560 --> 14:05.320
&lrm;Sorry, Bubbler, party's over.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.240
&lrm;Why you gotta be like that?

14:07.560 --> 14:09.960
&lrm;You made all the adults disappear,

14:10.080 --> 14:12.680
&lrm;and now you're imprisoning
&lrm;anyone who isn't having fun.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.360
&lrm;You will not bust up my party!

14:27.240 --> 14:29.160
&lrm;I think I've been a complete idiot.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.360
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

14:56.320 --> 14:58.040
&lrm;Looks like I made it just in time.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.080
&lrm;I had it under control...

15:00.200 --> 15:01.040
&lrm;but thanks.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.600
&lrm;Get their Miraculouses.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.560
&lrm;I want those powers... Now!

15:07.280 --> 15:09.080
&lrm;[he roars]

15:09.240 --> 15:10.440
&lrm;[bubbling]

15:10.600 --> 15:11.680
&lrm;[she gasps]

15:18.560 --> 15:19.400
&lrm;[he cackles]

15:26.120 --> 15:28.440
&lrm;[Marinette whimpers]

15:28.560 --> 15:30.840
&lrm;[he laughs wickedly]

15:35.200 --> 15:37.200
&lrm;Give me your Miraculouses
&lrm;before you run out of air.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.520
&lrm;Dream on, Bubbler.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.520
&lrm;Total party-poopers, just like adults.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.320
&lrm;Kids need adults!

15:43.680 --> 15:47.080
&lrm;False. Kids need freedom, fun,
&lrm;let loose and live it up.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.920
&lrm;[Bubbler] Adults are bossy.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.320
&lrm;[Marinette] But adults keep children safe.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.840
&lrm;They care for their kids. They love them.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.200
&lrm;Most adults do anyhow.
&lrm;You must bring the adults back.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.240
&lrm;Nope, never... Know what?

15:59.400 --> 16:03.840
&lrm;Since you care about them so much,
&lrm;why don't you go float with them?

16:07.720 --> 16:09.320
&lrm;[they scream]

16:10.920 --> 16:13.000
&lrm;What do you think you're doing, Bubbler?

16:13.160 --> 16:15.360
&lrm;You're supposed to seize
&lrm;their Miraculouses!

16:18.160 --> 16:19.320
&lrm;Use your Cataclysm.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.480
&lrm;Couldn't you have said that 500 feet ago?

16:21.720 --> 16:24.600
&lrm;We can't stay stuck
&lrm;in this bubble together forever.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.480
&lrm;Cataclysm!

16:32.000 --> 16:33.120
&lrm;[she screams]

16:33.240 --> 16:36.240
&lrm;-Shall we see if you land on your feet?
&lrm;-No thanks.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.880
&lrm;Your stick... there!

16:39.200 --> 16:40.200
&lrm;Got it!

16:43.400 --> 16:44.640
&lrm;Hang on!

16:46.840 --> 16:48.320
&lrm;[they yell]

16:50.800 --> 16:52.360
&lrm;Good thing cats aren't afraid of heights.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.080
&lrm;We have to get to his bubble sword.
&lrm;That's where the Akuma is.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.480
&lrm;[bleeping]

16:58.200 --> 16:59.360
&lrm;We'd better hurry.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.000
&lrm;Where is everybody?
&lrm;Get out here and party.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.920
&lrm;Sorry to burst your bubble.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.319
&lrm;-Ladybug!
&lrm;-Ladybug! Ladybug!

17:07.440 --> 17:10.040
&lrm;No one wants to party with you anymore,
&lrm;Bubbler.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.119
&lrm;What's wrong with you all guys?
&lrm;Why you gotta be such haters?

17:14.240 --> 17:16.200
&lrm;[he roars]

17:18.359 --> 17:19.440
&lrm;No!

17:21.359 --> 17:24.000
&lrm;Outer space is the next stop
&lrm;for your precious peeps.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.640
&lrm;And they're never coming back!

17:41.800 --> 17:43.200
&lrm;[bleeping]

17:43.360 --> 17:44.880
&lrm;I'm gonna switch back soon. Hurry!

17:45.680 --> 17:47.040
&lrm;Lucky charm!

17:51.800 --> 17:54.440
&lrm;Your... plumbing skills gonna help us out?

18:01.480 --> 18:02.320
&lrm;Your aim needs work.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.800
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Is that all you got?

18:10.440 --> 18:11.520
&lrm;Got it.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.600
&lrm;[hissing]

18:16.760 --> 18:18.480
&lrm;[Ladybug] Cat Noir, cover me.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.680
&lrm;Go on!

18:24.320 --> 18:25.880
&lrm;[he roars]

18:33.800 --> 18:36.320
&lrm;[Ladybug] Get out of here, you nasty bug.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.880
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.400
&lrm;Time to de-evilize!

18:48.080 --> 18:48.920
&lrm;Gotcha.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.960
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.400
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:03.400 --> 19:05.240
&lrm;Who? Dude...

19:06.040 --> 19:07.000
&lrm;Pound it.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.640
&lrm;You can't run forever, Ladybug.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.840
&lrm;And when I catch you, I will crush you.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.880
&lrm;I will destroy you both!

19:19.720 --> 19:20.560
<i>&lrm;Nathalie?</i>

19:20.680 --> 19:21.800
<i>&lrm;Did my son like his gift?</i>

19:22.200 --> 19:24.080
&lrm;[nervously] Actually...

19:24.200 --> 19:25.640
&lrm;I was going to check right away.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.800
<i>&lrm;Good.</i>

19:32.160 --> 19:33.160
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

19:42.840 --> 19:45.040
&lrm;A birthday present... from your father.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.720
&lrm;[happily surprised] Oh... thank you.

19:48.160 --> 19:51.080
&lrm;I mean... please say
&lrm;thank you to my father for me.

19:57.840 --> 19:58.800
&lrm;[Chloe] What do you mean

19:58.920 --> 20:00.000
&lrm;'"Not for a week"?

20:00.440 --> 20:02.720
&lrm;There were no adults to deliver it.

20:02.840 --> 20:06.600
&lrm;So what? Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.520
&lrm;Serves Chloe right.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.040
&lrm;[Adrien] Hey, girls.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.760
&lrm;Hey, that's my scarf.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.440
&lrm;He's wearing my scarf.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.160
&lrm;Hey, dude.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.520
&lrm;Yo, nice scarf, Adrien. Off the chain.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.160
&lrm;Yeah. Can you believe it?

20:23.280 --> 20:24.280
&lrm;My dad got it for me?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.240
&lrm;It's so awesome.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.200
&lrm;He's gotten me a lame pen
&lrm;for 3 years in a row.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.160
&lrm;Wow. I guess anyone can change.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.520
&lrm;Adults can be cool
&lrm;when you least expect it.

20:32.640 --> 20:36.120
&lrm;Speaking of adults, my father said
&lrm;you were a bad influence but...

20:36.240 --> 20:40.080
&lrm;Don't sweat it.
&lrm;We're buds, always n' forever.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.000
&lrm;You've gotta tell him
&lrm;you knitted the scarf.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.760
&lrm;But he seems so happy about his dad.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.480
&lrm;I don't want to spoil it for him.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.960
&lrm;[endearing sigh] Marinette...

20:50.800 --> 20:53.520
&lrm;You're amazing, girl.
&lrm;You know that, right?

20:53.640 --> 20:57.160
&lrm;And someday,
&lrm;Adrien will figure it out too... promise.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.440
&lrm;[school bell rings]
