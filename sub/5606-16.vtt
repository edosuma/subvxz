Barbers would make house calls

00:18.719 --> 00:20.219
to families and nobility.

00:20.221 --> 00:23.122
Come on.
I'm serious.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.025
They found hieroglyphics
in the pyramids

00:26.027 --> 00:27.559
showing pharaohs
getting their hair cut.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.162
Okay, and you're carrying
the legacy for all barbers?

00:30.164 --> 00:32.181
Exactly.
Uh-huh.

00:32.182 --> 00:34.199
Why go out when your hair
maintenance man can come to you?

00:34.201 --> 00:35.167
Huh.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.735
Truthfully,

00:36.737 --> 00:39.405
the whole thing
has been liberating.

00:39.407 --> 00:42.508
Not having insurance on the shop
turned out to be a blessing.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.276
I'm saving a fortune on rent,

00:44.278 --> 00:45.677
electricity, water.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.346
Yeah, right,
low overhead, right?

00:47.348 --> 00:48.347
Must be good for profits.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.249
Well, actually,

00:50.251 --> 00:52.251
I'm still just barely
getting by. Go figure.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.154
But, uh, I'm not complaining.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.488
Catching waves, cutting hair.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.123
What else does
a man need?

00:58.125 --> 00:59.324
You said it, pal.

00:59.326 --> 01:02.227
All right, let's take a look.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.495
Voilà.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.531
(whistles)
Buddy.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.299
Thank you, it's perfect.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.201
That's what I want to hear.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.702
Anything else I can do for you?

01:10.704 --> 01:13.472
Yes. I didn't just call
you down here for a haircut.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.441
I need a favor.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.110
That's my cue to say good-bye.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.245
Where you going? You haven't
even heard what it is yet.

01:20.247 --> 01:23.082
Yeah. Last time
I did you a favor

01:23.084 --> 01:26.218
I opened my shop early,
I spent the rest of my day

01:26.220 --> 01:28.854
dodging bullets.
So if you don't mind,

01:28.856 --> 01:30.622
I'd like to leave now

01:30.624 --> 01:33.559
with my cash
for services rendered

01:33.561 --> 01:35.394
and, uh, a generous tip.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.728
And I will see you again

01:36.730 --> 01:38.564
when things get unruly upstairs.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.265
Odell, if I had

01:40.267 --> 01:41.834
another choice,
I wouldn't ask, but I don't.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.335
My friend needs a lawyer,

01:43.337 --> 01:45.471
right now you're my only option.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.739
Well, as you can see...

01:47.741 --> 01:49.274
I'm not a lawyer.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.976
Yeah,
but you were a lawyer.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.677
You passed the bar when
you first moved to the island,

01:52.680 --> 01:54.146
which means technically

01:54.148 --> 01:55.380
you can still practice.

01:55.382 --> 01:58.117
(chuckles)
That was ten years ago, man.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.219
I only took the bar
because I needed a loan

02:00.221 --> 02:02.354
to open up my shop and my father

02:02.356 --> 02:03.889
wouldn't give me the money
unless I did.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.393
Just out of curiosity,

02:08.395 --> 02:10.229
what's your friend
being, uh, accused of?

02:10.231 --> 02:11.763
What is it, DUI, a B and E?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.433
Murder.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.335
I'm really not interested.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.170
He's innocent.
The public defender

02:18.172 --> 02:19.772
is ready to throw in the towel.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.373
The guy, he wants
to take a plea bargain.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.342
Well, don't take the deal.
Get a better lawyer.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.343
We can't. We tried.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.878
No one wants to touch this.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.413
Well, if everybody's saying
it's a losing horse,

02:28.415 --> 02:30.716
then, uh, maybe you better
step away from the window.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.718
Odell, this guy's
a Five-O asset.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.920
If he says he didn't do it,
we believe him.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.422
Unfortunately we're part
of the minority.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.725
Now, he's been in front
of this judge before. This guy

02:39.727 --> 02:42.728
has it in for him.
He's-he's accelerated the trial.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.230
Till when?

02:45.232 --> 02:46.431
This Monday.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.300
(laughs)
That's three days from now.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.936
I know it's three days from now.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.873
(sighs)

02:54.875 --> 02:57.476
Who the hell is this guy?

02:57.478 --> 02:59.545
(buzzer blares, door unlocks)

03:00.414 --> 03:02.181
Oh, sorry, this room's taken.

03:02.183 --> 03:05.284
You're gonna have to interrogate
this<i> haole</i> somewhere else.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.352
Sang Min, meet Odell Martin,

03:07.354 --> 03:09.421
your new lawyer.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.759
Seriously, McGarrett?

03:13.761 --> 03:16.395
This is the best you can do?

03:16.397 --> 03:17.596
Huh? What happened?

03:17.598 --> 03:18.597
Pizza delivery guy
wasn't available?

03:18.599 --> 03:22.401
Hey, Big Trouble
in Little China.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.870
You want my help,
ease up on the digs.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.572
Ho, ho, ho, yeah.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.374
You must be some lawyer.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.511
Huh? What, are you going
all out for casual Friday?

03:32.513 --> 03:34.413
Are you sure
you don't want

03:34.415 --> 03:36.515
this guy locked up for life?
'Cause I do.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.417
He grows on you. I promise.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.418
I bet he does,

03:39.420 --> 03:40.886
like a bad fungus.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.655
And if this is gonna happen,
first thing I'm gonna need to do

03:43.657 --> 03:45.857
is cut whatever that thing
is growing out of his head.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.326
You touch my hair,

03:47.328 --> 03:48.594
and I'll be going
to jail for your murder.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.300
This is gonna work out great.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.002
I can feel it.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.572
<i> (Hawaii Five-O</i>

04:28.302 --> 04:30.369
(buzzer blares)
ODELL: No, no.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.371
Absolutely no way

04:32.373 --> 04:34.473
am I representing
that cartoon character.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.540
Good luck.

04:35.542 --> 04:36.675
You didn't pay me
for the haircut.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.277
You know, maybe your
old man was right.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.611
Hey. Do me a favor,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.280
don't ever bring up my old man.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.447
All right?
My bad,

04:42.449 --> 04:43.515
sensitive subject.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.450
I get that.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.452
Must've been tough on him,
too, though.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.354
Putting all his
hopes and dreams

04:49.356 --> 04:50.656
into his son

04:50.658 --> 04:53.325
who would one day
follow in his footsteps

04:53.327 --> 04:55.527
and, you know, reside over
the family practice...

04:55.529 --> 04:57.529
I know what you're doing.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.830
Is it working?

04:58.832 --> 04:59.865
It's annoying.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.603
Odell, I know
it doesn't seem like it,

05:04.605 --> 05:07.039
but that man in there
is innocent of this crime.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.608
And I need you.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.578
I'm trying to free myself from
the binds of responsibility

05:13.580 --> 05:14.913
and you want to put
a man's life in my hands.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.582
But if you say no to me,

05:17.584 --> 05:19.518
an innocent man goes to prison.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.021
(buzzer blares)

05:25.025 --> 05:26.692
Come on.
Oh, let me guess.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.460
You couldn't find the elevator.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.795
Must be a bitch getting old.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.930
Would you shut up, please?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.332
He's taking the case.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.534
Well, what if I decide
I don't want him?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.536
You go to prison
for the rest of your life.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.639
Okay. He can represent me.
Hey!

05:40.641 --> 05:42.607
Well, your gratitude
is appreciated.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.476
STEVE:
That's great.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.344
ODELL: Okay, look, we only got
three days to prepare,

05:46.347 --> 05:49.414
so we can't afford to waste
any more time, hmm?

05:49.416 --> 05:52.417
Okay, Perry Mason...<i> not.</i>

05:52.419 --> 05:54.386
You know, but I draw the line
at cutting my hair.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.620
You know, it took me
almost a year to grow it back

05:55.622 --> 05:57.622
after skipping out on Halawa.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.526
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.530
You do know that a defendant

06:05.532 --> 06:06.865
who escaped from prison

06:06.867 --> 06:08.734
is probably gonna be somebody

06:08.736 --> 06:10.435
that a jury finds hard
to trust, you know?

06:10.437 --> 06:11.737
Yeah.  Kind of,
kind of destroys

06:11.739 --> 06:14.539
his credibility a bit.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.024
Yeah, so that's why it's
really important you make sure

06:16.025 --> 06:17.508
it doesn't get brought up
while we're in court.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.611
Only way for that to happen

06:19.613 --> 06:21.563
is keep him off the stand.

06:21.564 --> 06:23.514
Can you do me a favor
and tell him that, please?

06:23.517 --> 06:27.619
Um... look,
i-if you don't testify,

06:27.621 --> 06:30.088
the jury will only hear facts
pertaining to this case.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.690
As far as the court
of law is concerned,

06:31.692 --> 06:34.059
any crime you
committed in the past

06:34.061 --> 06:34.993
has no relevance.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.528
No, no, no, no.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.596
I have to testify.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.597
No, you don't.
No.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.598
Yes, I do!

06:39.600 --> 06:40.866
You don't.
No, you don't.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.135
Okay?
You get on that stand,

06:43.137 --> 06:44.536
they're gonna
attack your character.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.604
Everything you've ever done--

06:45.606 --> 06:46.838
<i> ever done--</i>

06:46.840 --> 06:48.740
is admissible, okay?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.609
And it's a long,
long list.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.414
I didn't shoot that guy,

06:55.416 --> 06:57.749
but there are
no witnesses

06:57.751 --> 06:59.584
who can back up my story.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.687
The jury has to hear
the truth from me.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.891
Hey, it ain't my life
on the line.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.859
You want on the stand,
have at it.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.195
But don't say I didn't
warn you. Okay?

07:10.197 --> 07:11.763
We got that cleared up? Yeah.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.198
Let's start
at the beginning.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.767
Tell me exactly what happened,
step by step.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.872
Well, it started, uh...
last year.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.141
I was lending my, uh, services

07:23.143 --> 07:25.110
to Five-O. STEVE: At that point,

07:25.112 --> 07:26.611
the human trafficking game
on the island

07:26.613 --> 07:27.746
was up for grabs.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.080
Two guys took it over.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.850
We knew the identify
of one of them, James Lam,

07:31.852 --> 07:33.185
but the other, we did not.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.454
That's why we took
Sang Min out of prison again

07:35.456 --> 07:36.688
ten days ago.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.523
SANG MIN:
Lam and I go way back,

07:38.525 --> 07:40.692
you know, I gave him his first
job collecting unpaid debts,

07:40.694 --> 07:42.861
so I set up
a face-to-face.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.030
<i> But when I showed up,</i>

07:45.032 --> 07:47.566
<i> the guy was, uh,</i>
<i> lying on the ground</i>

07:47.568 --> 07:49.100
<i> with a bullet in his chest.</i>

07:51.872 --> 07:54.706
(footsteps)

07:57.711 --> 07:58.777
(grunts)

08:05.586 --> 08:07.586
What happened next?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.955
Oh, let's just say
I was caught in a...

08:09.957 --> 08:11.756

08:21.802 --> 08:23.668

09:23.663 --> 09:25.262
You know,
I didn't realize

09:25.264 --> 09:27.431
you cared so much
about my safety.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.099
I'm, um, I'm deeply touched.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.335
You know, I'd feel
a lot safer

09:31.337 --> 09:34.038
if you were by my side
until the trial starts.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.005
KONO:
Okay. You know what?

09:35.007 --> 09:36.106
I'm glad
your lawyer's here,

09:36.108 --> 09:37.307
because I'm gonna hit you,

09:37.309 --> 09:38.942
and I want proof
that it was provoked.

09:38.944 --> 09:40.244
Oh, you know,

09:40.246 --> 09:41.945
give me your best shot, Spicy.

09:41.947 --> 09:44.014
You know, because
it's been a long time

09:44.016 --> 09:47.017
since I felt a woman's
hands on my body.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.686
Is he always this creepy?
KONO: Yes.

09:48.687 --> 09:50.354
Yeah, pretty much the whole time
we've known him, mm-hmm.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.457
Take off your dress

09:53.459 --> 09:55.726
so I know you're not
wearing a wire.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.404
You know, for the record,

10:07.406 --> 10:09.707
I knew you were a cop.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.076
I just wanted to see you,
you know...

10:12.078 --> 10:13.777
naked.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.380
Let me hit him, please.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.915
Hey, yo, McGarrett.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.184
Hey.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.753
All right, so,
the results came back

10:22.755 --> 10:24.221
from that sketch artist
composite

10:24.223 --> 10:25.956
that the mullet gave us
on the shooter.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.991
Photo imaging system
says no hits.

10:27.993 --> 10:29.860
(chuckles)

10:29.862 --> 10:31.295
Well, any gangsta
worth their salt

10:31.296 --> 10:32.729
wouldn't be in any system.
(phone ringing)

10:32.732 --> 10:34.732
You were.
Whoa.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.233
I got hate coming
from every direction, huh?

10:36.235 --> 10:38.769
Where's the love?
I thought we were<i> 'ohana.</i>

10:38.771 --> 10:40.237
Yeah, Max?
(knocking at door)

10:40.239 --> 10:41.972
I'll be right there.
I got to go.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.007
Oh, if that's room service,
I'm starving, man.

10:44.009 --> 10:46.343
That's for me.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.078
(knocking continues)

10:48.080 --> 10:49.980
What's happenin'?

10:51.383 --> 10:52.950
You're early, for once.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.852
Yo, you didn't tell me
Five-O was gonna be here.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.487
Everything all right?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.155
Everything's fine.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.023
The guy's got the wrong room.
Sorry, pal.

11:00.025 --> 11:01.859
STEVE:
Excuse me.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.827
You're lying.

11:04.797 --> 11:07.131
Okay. I'm lying.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.167
Come on, man. This is my friend
Bones. I do his dreads.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.070
He manages my dreads.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.974
Bones is a shaper
from the west side.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.176
Why didn't
you just say that?

11:20.112 --> 11:21.812
We got to tell 'em.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.147
GROVER:
Tell us what?

11:23.149 --> 11:25.482
Uh, okay. Bones

11:25.484 --> 11:27.017
might not be
what you call

11:27.019 --> 11:29.353
a legal citizen
of the United States.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.021
KONO: Okay, let me guess.
Your friend here

11:31.023 --> 11:33.190
has connections
to the human trafficking world.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.359
Exactly.
That's why I called him.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.560
With Bones' street cred,

11:36.562 --> 11:38.495
I think he's gonna
be able to help us out.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.497
Hey.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.833
Okay.

11:42.835 --> 11:45.569
But if my man
comes on board,

11:45.571 --> 11:47.838
I expect him to have
a green card waiting for him

11:47.840 --> 11:49.206
when this is all over.
Win or lose.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.874
Is it... is it just me

11:50.876 --> 11:52.342
or does he actually sound
like a lawyer?

11:52.344 --> 11:54.344
No, it ain't just you.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.480
A green card.

11:56.482 --> 11:59.349
Green card.

11:59.351 --> 12:00.584
It's a deal.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.553
Deal.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.188
There you go.
What'd I tell you?

12:04.190 --> 12:05.455
What'd I tell you? Okay.
Irie, bruddah. Blessed.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.044
The victim's approximately
25 years of age.

12:10.045 --> 12:12.129
He was discovered floating off
Waikiki Beach this morning.

12:12.131 --> 12:14.097
Cause of death--
gunshot wound to the head.

12:14.099 --> 12:15.432
Okay, and what's this got
to do with Sang Min?

12:15.434 --> 12:16.900
Quite a lot, actually.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.435
The slug I pulled
from our victim

12:18.437 --> 12:20.604
was a ballistics match
to the gun that was used

12:20.606 --> 12:22.539
to murder James Lam.

12:22.541 --> 12:25.108
Which mean Lam's competitors
killed both men.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.177
If we are to believe Sang Min's
account of events, then yes.

12:27.179 --> 12:28.545
STEVE: All right,
but if T.O.D.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.214
was before we took
Sang Min out of prison,

12:30.216 --> 12:31.481
then that would create
reasonable doubt.

12:31.483 --> 12:33.116
Well, unfortunately,
the condition

12:33.118 --> 12:35.452
of the body makes it
very difficult to determine

12:35.454 --> 12:37.254
the precise time of death,
however,

12:37.256 --> 12:38.922
I can confirm it was
within the last 72 hours.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.291
Well, that's within
the timeframe

12:41.293 --> 12:42.626
when Sang Min was released.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.428
Yeah, it doesn't
help our case.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.230
Who is he?

12:46.232 --> 12:47.681
His name is Carlos Sarte.

12:47.682 --> 12:49.131
Uh, his prints showed up
in the National I.D. System

12:49.134 --> 12:50.400
for the Republic
of the Philippines.

12:50.402 --> 12:52.002
However,
there were no records

12:52.004 --> 12:53.570
of him actually
entering the United States.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.939
Well, he could've been smuggled
into the country illegally.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.474
All right, we need to track down
his family in the Philippines,

12:57.476 --> 13:00.277
find out who his connections are
here in O'ahu.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.045
And see if we can figure out who
brought him into this country.

13:02.047 --> 13:04.181
If we do that,
maybe we can I.D. our shooter.

13:04.183 --> 13:05.215
Thanks, Max.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.187
(whoops)

13:12.124 --> 13:14.124
Oh, where was I?

13:14.126 --> 13:18.028
You were telling about the time
you almost killed Five-O.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.430
Oh, yeah.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.065
CHIN:
Gun!

13:26.205 --> 13:27.170
Anybody hurt?

13:27.172 --> 13:29.006
Good!
Good!

13:30.676 --> 13:32.643
(tires screeching)

13:41.620 --> 13:43.420
(car alarm wailing)

13:44.390 --> 13:46.423
Out of the car right now!

13:46.425 --> 13:49.693
Promise me you will not--
under any circumstances--

13:49.695 --> 13:52.062
repeat that story
while you're on the stand.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.597
Do you understand me?
Not a word.

13:54.566 --> 13:56.400
They instigated it!

13:56.402 --> 13:59.169
What did I just say?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.203
I can't hear.

14:00.205 --> 14:03.040
I got bubbles in my ear.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.642
WOMAN:
Oh!

14:09.682 --> 14:12.382
(crying)

14:12.384 --> 14:14.451
I'm sorry.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.458
We know that you
and your brother

14:21.460 --> 14:24.494
came into this
country illegally.

14:24.496 --> 14:27.297
We need to know
who brought you in.

14:27.299 --> 14:28.699
CHIN: Andrea,
this information

14:28.701 --> 14:30.267
could help us find out
who killed your brother.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.007
Now, we know you're scared.

14:37.009 --> 14:40.277
But anything you could
tell us would be helpful.

14:44.249 --> 14:46.249
The man who brought us

14:46.251 --> 14:49.252
called two days ago

14:49.254 --> 14:52.389
asking for more money
or he would report us

14:52.391 --> 14:54.591
to immigration.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.695
Is this the man?

14:58.697 --> 15:01.164
(sniffles)

15:01.166 --> 15:03.300
No.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.407
Okay.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.477
Can you, uh,
can you describe him to us?

15:15.381 --> 15:18.281
He's, um,

15:18.283 --> 15:21.585
Korean, I think.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.253
Tattoo on his neck

15:23.255 --> 15:26.256
and, uh, long black hair.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.298
Is that him?

15:35.300 --> 15:37.334
Yes.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.605
He's the one who called us.

15:43.542 --> 15:47.110
That man killed my brother.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.662
Who is he?

16:05.664 --> 16:07.798
Carlos Sarte.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.333
Our victim's sister
just I.D.'d you for his murder.

16:10.335 --> 16:12.436
Yeah, she said you
brought her and her brother

16:12.438 --> 16:13.503
over from the Philippines.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.405
Well, how am I supposed
to do that

16:15.407 --> 16:16.540
when I've been locked away
in a cement hole

16:16.542 --> 16:18.442
for the past year?!

16:18.444 --> 16:19.676
You can relax.
We believe you.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.445
Look, someone must've
gotten to her.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.780
Made sure that she I.D.'d Sang
Min for her brother's murder.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.382
STEVE:
Yeah, the shooter.

16:25.384 --> 16:26.516
Right?

16:26.518 --> 16:28.085
He knew the bullet
that killed Lam

16:28.087 --> 16:29.486
would lead us to Sarte.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.821
ODELL:
Okay, look, I'm glad

16:30.823 --> 16:32.456
everybody here thinks
the career criminal

16:32.458 --> 16:34.424
is telling the truth,
but we got a bigger problem now.

16:34.426 --> 16:37.594
You just gave the prosecution
their star witness.

16:37.596 --> 16:39.396
You know, I could
have her in a crate

16:39.398 --> 16:42.132
back to the Philippines
in seven hours.

16:44.369 --> 16:47.537
What? I thought
we were problem solving.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.606
Yeah.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.445
Okay, buddy, yeah.

16:55.447 --> 16:57.781
Okay, I'll talk
to you soon, bye.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.649
That was Danny.
He just landed in Jersey.

16:59.651 --> 17:01.451
He and Clara
headed to the bank.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.820
And then Danny's gonna take
Matty's money to the FBI.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.455
Hmm.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.125
You think he's right?

17:08.127 --> 17:09.893
That this whole thing
dragging Clara and Danny in

17:09.895 --> 17:12.662
was just a ploy
to rattle our cage?

17:12.664 --> 17:14.664
Yeah, I do.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.801
I think somebody has
us in their sites,

17:17.803 --> 17:20.670
and I got a feeling this
is just the beginning.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.540
(reggae music playing)

17:25.344 --> 17:28.545
BONES:
<i> Yo, what wrong with you?</i>

17:28.547 --> 17:30.547
No, I tell you already!

17:30.549 --> 17:33.316
I never even
talked to that bobo!

17:33.318 --> 17:35.318
No, no need to get bad mind!

17:35.320 --> 17:37.787
You're all that I want!
There's nobody else!

17:37.789 --> 17:39.656
Sure.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.658
Anyway, we talk later.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.859
Miss you, too.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.561
Yeah.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.562
Thank you, brother.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.764
Yeah.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.934
Anything else I can
do for you, brother?

17:50.936 --> 17:52.536
I mean, I'm driving you around.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.171
You're using my damn phone.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.406
You want me to stop
by a restaurant,

17:56.408 --> 17:58.608
get you some lunch?

17:58.610 --> 18:00.677
It's all right, man.
I'm not really hungry right now.

18:00.679 --> 18:01.845
Maybe later.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.549
(sighs)

18:05.551 --> 18:07.651
All right, Bones.

18:07.653 --> 18:11.354
Now, tell me about this guy
we're going to see.

18:11.356 --> 18:12.789
Rory.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.492
Rory have the hookup on bringing
people into the island.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.294
Mm.
Then...

18:17.296 --> 18:19.362
him keep a low profile.

18:19.364 --> 18:20.564
But him hear everything

18:20.566 --> 18:21.898
that's going on
in the trafficking game.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.500
Mm.

18:23.502 --> 18:24.601
If you are looking

18:24.603 --> 18:26.203
for a major player
in that world,

18:26.205 --> 18:27.637
him would know who it is.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.639
Right.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.641
Only one thing, though.

18:31.643 --> 18:32.742
What's that?

18:32.744 --> 18:35.612
Him don't like the po-po.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.347
What a shock.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.715
Straight up.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.818
Just follow my lead
and everything irie.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.887
<i> Oy vey.</i>

18:45.390 --> 18:46.656
(sighs)

18:50.495 --> 18:51.962
Bones!

18:53.665 --> 18:56.233
What's going on, man?
Yo.

18:56.235 --> 18:57.334
Been a long time, brother.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.335
Too long, Rory.

18:58.337 --> 18:59.736
(chuckles)

18:59.738 --> 19:00.570
Everything irie?

19:00.572 --> 19:01.972
Can't complain, man.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.540
Nice, nice.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.375
You didn't mention you were
bringing someone, man.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.477
This is Walt, man.
My boy is some cool.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.346
(Jamaican accent): Everything irie, man.
Relax, man.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.715
Me and the Bones been doing
business a long time.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.783
Me grew up in Jamaica
with him father.

19:13.785 --> 19:16.720
Oh, yeah? Where you from?

19:16.722 --> 19:17.887
Where...?

19:17.889 --> 19:19.689
Hey, Bones, why you not tell me

19:19.691 --> 19:21.024
the man gonna give me
a quiz when I get here.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.260
Just talk to the man, man...

19:23.262 --> 19:25.362
No cast no suspicion upon me.
Me not like that.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.464
You see me 100% Jamaican

19:27.466 --> 19:29.466
from the root to the fruit.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.302
And me born in Surrey,
just like him father.

19:32.304 --> 19:35.338
Now, come now, man.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.774
No need for get vex.

19:37.776 --> 19:40.043
We have a pile of money.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.378
You want some of it?

19:41.380 --> 19:43.147
Just like I
told you, Rory.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.650
Remember that deal
I was telling you about?

19:45.652 --> 19:47.451
I got some friends
in the Ivory Coast.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.786
Been looking to bring
some people Stateside.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.555
Won't be cheap, brother.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.991
(chuckles)

19:52.992 --> 19:55.426
Well, good thing them people
have plenty cash.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.595
I will need someone
with your connections

19:57.597 --> 19:59.463
can, you know,
secure the transportation.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.365
Make sure them arrive safe.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.833
Just one little detail.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.436
We may have to take
a small percentage

20:05.438 --> 20:07.605
for we.
A good piece.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.575
I might know someone
who could help you out, man.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.576
Nice.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.610
I'll hook you guys up

20:12.612 --> 20:13.811
with a sit-down, all right?

20:13.813 --> 20:15.646
Sound good, sound good.
We cool, man.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.748
(no accent): That's perfect,
man. That's all I need.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.420
Bones!
Aw, don't get mad at ol' Bones.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.256
He got more charges
than my wife's credit cards.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.691
He'll do anything
to get out of them.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.260
That's entrapment, man.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.628
Won't hold up in court.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.263
You know it and I know it.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.497
Oh, you think I'm a cop.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.866
Oh, I'm not a cop.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.768
No, see, um,

20:37.770 --> 20:39.837
I'm Five-O.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.776
So, what, him fess up?

20:45.778 --> 20:48.613
You better quit popping up like
toast in other people's cars.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.615
That's how you get shot.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.583
(phone dialing)

20:52.585 --> 20:55.486
GROVER:
I just met with Bones' contact

20:55.488 --> 20:57.388
He I.D.'d the sketch
that Sang Min provided.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.324
The guy's name is Graham Clark,
and guess what?

21:00.326 --> 21:03.261
He's bringing in a shipment
of clients this afternoon.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.662
Where?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.731
(gunshots)

21:18.344 --> 21:21.045
Chin, watch your lines--
we got people in that container!

21:21.047 --> 21:23.047
Copy!
(people screaming)

21:29.589 --> 21:31.789
I got eyes on Graham!

21:36.362 --> 21:37.862
Hey, where the hell is he going?

21:40.767 --> 21:41.832
To buy himself some time.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.939
Chin!

21:48.941 --> 21:50.875
We're gonna get wet!

21:50.877 --> 21:52.710
I'm right with you!

21:52.712 --> 21:55.746
Cover me!
Do your thing. I got you!

22:10.496 --> 22:12.096
(clanks)

22:16.669 --> 22:18.602
(squeaking)

22:32.485 --> 22:34.552
(coughing)

22:38.424 --> 22:41.025
(coughing)

22:43.663 --> 22:45.096
(gasps for air)

22:45.098 --> 22:46.430
We're good.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.565
Okay?

22:47.567 --> 22:49.133
Everybody all right?

22:49.135 --> 22:51.102
Yeah.
Come on.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.109
We got everyone
but Graham Clark.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.944
I've got all my men
searching, Steve.

22:59.946 --> 23:02.413
We'll find him.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.748
All right, continue
with the compressions.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.616
(garbled radio transmission)
All right, head's good.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.818
Hey, yo, McGarrett?

23:07.820 --> 23:10.454
(siren wailing)

23:10.456 --> 23:13.557
So this mutt in the
ambulance just confirmed

23:13.559 --> 23:14.859
that Clark killed James Lam.

23:15.862 --> 23:16.961
Will he testify?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.963
If he comes out
of surgery.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.831
(sirens wailing)

23:23.770 --> 23:25.770
Your Honor,

23:25.772 --> 23:27.838
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

23:27.840 --> 23:29.673
the prosecution is going
to present evidence...

23:29.675 --> 23:31.175
Objection.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.810
ODELL:
Jerry, it's

23:32.812 --> 23:34.745
my opening statement.
You can't object.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.013
Oh. Sorry.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.848
I just always wanted
to do that.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.084
Yeah, while we're on the
subject, I also object.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.952
To what? Well, according
to the Constitution,

23:41.954 --> 23:43.621
I have the right

23:43.623 --> 23:45.723
to be tried
by a jury of my peers.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.592
And neither of them
are my peers.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.195
That hurts.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.831
I must remind the jury

23:53.833 --> 23:57.701
it is against the rules
to interact with the defendant.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.003
Relax, Judge Ito.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.704
My fellow juror was
just responding

24:00.706 --> 24:01.872
to a character attack.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.574
Hey, where you get those?

24:03.576 --> 24:05.743
Mini bar?  ODELL:
Hey, you can't eat.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.945
You're on the jury. KAMEKONA:
We could be sequestered

24:07.947 --> 24:09.713
for days.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.015
It's a mock trial.
(knocking)

24:11.017 --> 24:12.516
MAN:
Room service.

24:12.518 --> 24:13.984
Who the hell
ordered room service?

24:13.986 --> 24:15.486
KAMEKONA:
That would be me.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.955
And I object
to your use of language,

24:17.957 --> 24:20.925
'cause this is
a place of law.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.760
Order's been cancelled.

24:22.762 --> 24:23.761
Mahalo.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.847
(door closes)

24:25.848 --> 24:27.932
A man's life hangs
in the balance, okay?

24:27.934 --> 24:30.468
I'm asking just
for a couple of hours

24:30.470 --> 24:33.637
to work on some things before
going into court on Monday.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.240
So how about we show
a little professionalism?

24:36.242 --> 24:38.242
Yeah, you heard
my lawyer-barber.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.579
Show some respect.
KAMEKONA: I'll participate,

24:41.581 --> 24:42.880
but only in silent protest.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.648
Me, too.

24:44.650 --> 24:45.883
I appreciate that.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.184
Max, would you please?

24:48.554 --> 24:51.822
The defense may call
upon their first witness.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.924
Once is enough with that. Okay.

24:53.926 --> 24:57.161
Uh, Defense calls
Officer Kono Kalakaua

24:57.163 --> 24:58.562
of the Five-O Task Force.

24:58.564 --> 25:01.165
All right. Ooh!

25:01.167 --> 25:03.701
(clicking tongue)

25:03.703 --> 25:06.670
My beautiful sister,

25:06.672 --> 25:08.706
do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

25:08.708 --> 25:11.359
and nothing but
the sweet truth?

25:11.360 --> 25:14.011
Uh, I think you're butchering
that, but I'll say yes.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.679
That work for me.

25:15.681 --> 25:19.683
Officer Kalakaua, everybody
knows the Five-O task force

25:19.685 --> 25:22.019
has had run-ins
in the past with my client.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.921
You could say that.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.056
Yet even with your history,
you stand here today

25:26.058 --> 25:28.058
in defense of my client,

25:28.060 --> 25:29.593
believing him innocent
of the crime.

25:29.595 --> 25:30.594
Is that correct?

25:30.596 --> 25:31.929
Yes, it is.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.597
Well, that is quite
the turnaround, no?

25:33.599 --> 25:35.032
I mean, you did arrest him.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.903
People change, Counselor,
and I can honestly say,

25:38.905 --> 25:40.905
in all my time
on the Five-O task force,

25:40.907 --> 25:44.208
no one has changed
more than Sang Min.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.144
JERRY:
That might be true,

25:47.146 --> 25:50.714
but these photos
are mug shots...

25:52.151 --> 25:56.020
...taken of Sang Min
for crimes committed

25:56.022 --> 25:58.889
during his illustrious career
as a criminal.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.659
Looks like
an evolutional chart.

26:01.661 --> 26:04.695
Only, it's going the other way.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.764
JERRY:
Do you recall

26:06.766 --> 26:10.067
what offense you committed
when this mug shot was taken?

26:13.272 --> 26:17.174
Why don't you tell me, Paco?

26:17.176 --> 26:19.043
I'd be happy to.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.611
It's from...

26:20.613 --> 26:23.347
your early years
as a criminal mastermind.

26:23.349 --> 26:27.017
When you and James Lam
were arrested

26:27.019 --> 26:29.353
for extortion.

26:29.355 --> 26:32.323
Only, Lam never went to prison.

26:32.325 --> 26:35.059
And you did.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.061
For a whole year.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.198
That, my friends, is motive.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.633
Ah, take it easy, Matlock.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.736
Yeah, I hated him,
but I wouldn't kill him.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.739
No, death just ain't
my bag, baby.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.075
Well, if James Lam
were here today,

26:51.077 --> 26:52.910
I'm guessing
he'd disagree with you.

26:52.912 --> 26:57.014
Well, seeing as he's dead,
I guess we'll never know, huh?

26:57.016 --> 27:00.985
How very convenient.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.720
The prosecution rests.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.288
McGarrett should've called Saul.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.028
Maybe we should
take the deal.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.400
Thank God. Please, tell me
Clark's guy pulled through

27:16.402 --> 27:18.068
and he's willing to testify.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.970
He died in surgery.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.972
Well, what about Clark?

27:21.974 --> 27:23.140
Can we find him?

27:23.142 --> 27:24.141
I don't know.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.376
He's in the wind.

27:25.378 --> 27:28.178
(sighs)

27:30.149 --> 27:31.815
It's up to you, bruddah.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.283
Time for you to shine.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.352
(sighs)

27:44.697 --> 27:46.764
♪ ♪

28:04.917 --> 28:07.251
What are you doing?

28:07.253 --> 28:08.919
Odell, the judge just
put you on the clock.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.921
You got... you got, like,
four minutes to get in there.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.257
I don't need any more pressure,
McGarrett, okay?

28:13.259 --> 28:14.391
I'm panicked enough
as it is.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.659
What are you panicked about?

28:15.660 --> 28:16.926
You got this.
You're gonna be fine.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.396
Yeah, well, I'm-I'm
glad you think so.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.932
What are you talking about?

28:21.934 --> 28:26.270
Look, I promised myself I would
never be like my old man,

28:26.272 --> 28:28.839
and now you're asking me
to just...

28:28.841 --> 28:30.474
break that promise.

28:35.448 --> 28:36.447
Okay.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.048
I'm sorry.

28:43.289 --> 28:47.825
You know,
it's funny, my, uh...

28:47.827 --> 28:52.362
my dad and I didn't talk
for a long time.

28:52.364 --> 28:55.199
Years and years.

28:55.201 --> 28:59.103
I regret that time
in my life...

28:59.105 --> 29:02.973
more than pretty much anything
that's ever happened.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.944
I don't know what's going on
between you and your dad, Odell.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.278
It's not my business.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.380
But...

29:10.382 --> 29:13.350
whatever it is,
you gotta resolve it.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.752
Or you gotta let it go.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.456
Right now...

29:19.457 --> 29:21.457
Right now, there's a courtroom
full of people in there,

29:21.460 --> 29:23.327
and there's an innocent guy
waiting for you,

29:23.329 --> 29:25.496
so what do you want to do?

29:27.233 --> 29:28.232
<i> "E ho mai</i>

29:28.234 --> 29:30.434
<i> ka ike mai luna mai e."</i>

29:32.138 --> 29:34.471
"Come, come bring us knowledge
and wisdom from above."

29:34.473 --> 29:35.806
You only said
half the prayer.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.875
I only know half of it.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.345
Better than nothing.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.193
Better late than never,
Counselor.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.264
Tell you what.

30:00.266 --> 30:04.468
You win this case,
I'll let you cut my hair.

30:09.809 --> 30:13.477
My client, Sang Min Sooh,
is innocent.

30:13.479 --> 30:17.314
He did not kill... James Lam.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.448
No.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.818
He was acting

30:20.820 --> 30:22.986
as a confidential informant

30:22.988 --> 30:25.556
for the Five-O Task Force

30:25.558 --> 30:29.226
when the, uh, incident
in question occurred.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.896
Now, we all know the Five-O,

30:32.898 --> 30:36.600
and-and-and-and we know
all the hard work they do,

30:36.602 --> 30:39.603
protecting this great
island of Oahu.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.473
Their investigation
into human trafficking

30:43.475 --> 30:45.475
led them to James Lam,

30:45.477 --> 30:49.546
and they needed Sang Min Sooh's
help to bring him to justice.

30:49.548 --> 30:53.217
And Sang Min was more
than willing to help.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.419
He didn't waver.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.620
He didn't...

30:56.622 --> 30:58.589
he didn't worry
about his own safety.

30:58.591 --> 30:59.590
He...

30:59.592 --> 31:01.024
just said yes.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.628
He just said yes.

31:06.599 --> 31:08.866
Most people
would call that heroic.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.970
Thank you.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.311
(sighs)

31:21.313 --> 31:23.380
Not bad for a barber.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.519
And you're 100% certain

31:29.521 --> 31:32.990
Sang Min Sooh fired
the murder weapon?

31:32.992 --> 31:35.993
Our crime lab
technicians conducted

31:35.995 --> 31:38.328
a gunshot residue test on scene.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.297
The result was positive.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.633
The slug that was pulled
from James Lam matched the gun

31:42.635 --> 31:45.135
that Sang Min was in possession
of at the crime scene.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.603
Was Sang Min Sooh
wearing a wire?

31:46.605 --> 31:49.139
No, uh, it was too risky.

31:49.141 --> 31:52.609
We needed to give him some space
to protect his cover.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.479
Which means you didn't have
eyes on him at all times.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.548
So then you have no proof Sang
Min Sooh didn't kill James Lam.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.517
No, but we...

32:00.519 --> 32:02.119
No further questions, Commander.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.489
Prosecution rests.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.991

32:08.961 --> 32:11.228
Counselor Martin?
Yes, yes, yes.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.724
that knows the truth...

32:40.726 --> 32:42.459
about James Lam's murder.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.196
Yeah, that's right.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.743
Okay, well,
that-that would explain

32:59.745 --> 33:03.280
why, uh, you were holding the
murder weapon when HPD arrived

33:03.282 --> 33:06.249
and why you tested
positive for GSR.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.719
That's the fact, Jack.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.021
ODELL: Um, Your Honor,

Uh, these...

33:23.669 --> 33:27.371
These photographs are
of the shell casings

33:27.373 --> 33:29.072
found at the crime scene.

33:29.074 --> 33:32.209
One is near the body,
as you see,

33:32.211 --> 33:34.678
but the other... was found

33:34.680 --> 33:35.746
by the inventory

33:35.748 --> 33:38.448
of the warehouse.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.117
That's where Sang Min said
he encountered the shooter.

33:40.119 --> 33:43.453
So the-the locations
of these shell casings

33:43.455 --> 33:44.688
corroborate his story.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.289
Objection.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.258
Counselor is speculating.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.594
Your objection was
more convincing, bruddah.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.729
Shh!

Graham Clark.

34:03.709 --> 34:07.711
Your Honor, I'd like
to show the jury exhibit C.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.246

34:09.248 --> 34:10.580
Thank you.

34:10.582 --> 34:13.250

This is a mug shot

34:16.722 --> 34:19.689
who is a suspected
human trafficker.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.593
Is this the man you fought with?

34:36.608 --> 34:38.608
Yeah, that's him.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.344
PROSECUTOR:
Your Honor, I object.

34:41.346 --> 34:42.813
Mr. Clark's not on trial here.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.581
Sang Min Sooh is.

34:45.651 --> 34:47.751
JUDGE:
Sustained.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.719
Um, I...

34:49.721 --> 34:52.722
withdraw the question.

34:52.724 --> 34:55.459
Do you wear
prescription glasses?

34:55.461 --> 34:57.594
Huh?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.763
Do you wear
prescription glasses?

34:59.765 --> 35:01.248
Glasses?

35:01.249 --> 35:02.732
Yeah, glasses, eyeglasses.
Do you wear them?

35:02.734 --> 35:05.602
I'm the perfect
package, bruddah.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.637
(laughter)
No imperfections here, huh?

35:07.639 --> 35:09.639
Yeah, well, maybe
you're not so perfect.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.141
Do me a favor.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.844
Read the Hawaiian state
seal right over there.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.618
Don't look at me.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.320
Read the seal.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.556
Go ahead, read it.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.562
You can't read it, can you?
No, I can't.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.664
Huh?!

35:37.236 --> 35:38.702
Now why don't we,
you know, get back

35:38.704 --> 35:41.571
to the regular scheduled
program, huh, Judge?

35:41.573 --> 35:44.674
Have you ever suffered a head trauma?
Does this head look trauma'd to you?

35:44.676 --> 35:47.677
Sang Min, isn't it true
that Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly

35:47.679 --> 35:49.379
of the Five-O Task Force

35:49.381 --> 35:51.214
hit you across the face
with an ash tray

35:51.216 --> 35:52.582
the first time
he met you?

35:52.584 --> 35:55.152
I don't remember!

36:00.726 --> 36:04.494
Judge, please instruct my client
to answer the question.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.865
The witness will answer
the question.

36:12.804 --> 36:13.937
Yes.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.473
Lieutenant Kelly hit me.

36:16.475 --> 36:21.178
But to be fair, eh,
probably deserved it.

36:21.180 --> 36:23.446
I'm gonna sue you
for entrapment.

36:23.448 --> 36:25.348
And when I'm done collecting,

36:25.350 --> 36:27.684
I'm gonna find that little
hottie you sent in here,

36:27.686 --> 36:30.854
and this time, I'm gonna be
less of a gentleman.

36:32.524 --> 36:35.792
I have no further questions
for the witness, Your Honor.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.795
McGarrett, your man
is leaking oil.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.797
He's doing something. Hang on.
ODELL: Hey.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.933
(whispering): Okay, I need
you to do something for me.

36:48.207 --> 36:52.776
Uh... defense calls
Dr. Max Bergman

36:52.778 --> 36:55.212
once again to the stand.

36:55.214 --> 36:57.547
The bullet that struck
Mr. Lam hit center mass,

36:57.549 --> 36:59.883
and there was no starring
around the entry wound,

36:59.885 --> 37:02.552
which would suggest that
the shot that killed Mr. Lam

37:02.554 --> 37:03.920
was fired at a distance.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.223
Okay, and now in your
expert medical opinion,

37:06.225 --> 37:10.527
is it possible to suffer
long-term vision problems

37:10.529 --> 37:11.861
after sustaining
a head trauma

37:11.863 --> 37:13.230
like the one
my client received

37:13.232 --> 37:14.998
at the hands
of Lieutenant Kelly?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.534
In my expert medical opinion,

37:17.536 --> 37:20.870
blunt ocular trauma
is known to cause myopia,

37:20.872 --> 37:23.873
which in layman's term
is nearsightedness.

37:23.875 --> 37:24.874
Nearsightedness.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.576
ODELL:
Officer Kalakaua,

37:26.578 --> 37:29.246
is it true that you're
an expert in marksmanship?

37:29.248 --> 37:30.413
Yes.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.749
Okay, the murder
weapon used

37:32.751 --> 37:35.752
was a Beretta
model 86 Cheetah .22.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.855
Now, how accurate
would you say that gun is?

37:38.857 --> 37:41.391
The Beretta model 86
has a short barrel,

37:41.393 --> 37:42.859
which means if fired
at a distance,

37:42.861 --> 37:44.628
it's highly unreliable.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.963
Highly unreliable at a distance.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.299
So what would you say
the probability is

37:49.301 --> 37:50.767
that a man with poor eyesight

37:50.769 --> 37:52.535
who hasn't fired a gun

37:52.537 --> 37:53.770
in over a year

37:53.772 --> 37:56.606
could shoot a man
dead center mass

37:56.608 --> 37:59.976
with a Beretta model 86
from 60 feet away

37:59.978 --> 38:01.978
in a dark environment?

38:03.382 --> 38:06.283
I'd say it's nearly impossible.

38:14.893 --> 38:19.029
It is mandatory for every inmate
to receive a physical exam

38:19.031 --> 38:21.831
before entering a prison
in the United States.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.301
I pulled Sang Min's
records from Halawa.

38:24.303 --> 38:27.904
He did a short stint
in 2008, at which time

38:27.906 --> 38:30.040
his eyesight was 20/20.

38:30.042 --> 38:33.576
However, his most recent exam
earlier this year

38:33.578 --> 38:35.478
showed his eyesight
to be 20/100.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.014
(courtroom chattering)

38:38.016 --> 38:42.519
Apparently, Mr. Sooh was offered
spectacles at the time,

38:42.521 --> 38:43.920
which he declined.

38:46.358 --> 38:48.692
With my client's
poor vision,

38:48.694 --> 38:51.361
there is no way he could
have fired the shot

38:51.363 --> 38:52.462
that killed James Lam.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.403
Thank you, Commander.

39:00.405 --> 39:02.839
