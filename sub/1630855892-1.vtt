-Yeah?
-In return, I'm gonna need you

32:42.588 --> 32:44.466
to spread the word
among the usual suspects

32:44.551 --> 32:45.803
that moving forward,

32:45.886 --> 32:47.849
my house is a place
where a human now lives,

32:47.932 --> 32:50.228
and is therefore
no longer a suitable venue

32:50.311 --> 32:51.606
for social functions.

32:51.690 --> 32:53.151
-Okay.
-Yeah? Can you do that?

32:53.234 --> 32:54.863
-That's all you need?
-That's it.

32:55.781 --> 32:58.286
-I mean, for sure.
-[knocks table] Great.

32:58.369 --> 32:59.581
-Thank you, Isaiah.
-Thank you.

32:59.664 --> 33:01.041
-Hey, before you go...
-Yeah?

33:02.085 --> 33:03.421
Here is the key to your house.

33:03.505 --> 33:05.509
Hey, how kind of you.

33:05.593 --> 33:06.636
[Isaiah] Yeah.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.805
[Bratt smacks lips]

33:07.889 --> 33:10.101
That's the slaps, right?

33:10.185 --> 33:12.189
Oh, I'll figure it out.
I don't think I'm using it right.

33:12.272 --> 33:14.276
This is gonna be great.
We're gonna laugh about this one day.

33:14.359 --> 33:16.990
-Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Bratt.
-Nice to meet you!

33:17.073 --> 33:18.201
You too!

33:18.284 --> 33:20.413
[Isaiah sighs]

33:28.513 --> 33:31.435
[unsettling music]

33:48.720 --> 33:50.348
What the hell?

33:58.197 --> 33:59.283
[Margot scoffs]

34:03.374 --> 34:05.838
[ominous music]

34:10.305 --> 34:12.100
[candy bar thuds]

34:16.358 --> 34:18.822
Um... Can I help you?

34:20.993 --> 34:22.495
[school bell rings]

34:22.580 --> 34:25.501
[students chattering]

34:25.586 --> 34:28.049
[Margot coughing]

34:30.345 --> 34:31.806
Are you okay?

34:31.890 --> 34:34.604
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wh-- What's wrong with her?

34:34.687 --> 34:35.647
Nut allergy. Get the nurse!

34:35.731 --> 34:36.858
-Get the nurse!
-Move, move, move!

34:36.941 --> 34:38.904
Tell me you have your EpiPen? Yeah?

34:38.987 --> 34:40.699
Get the nurse, man!

34:40.783 --> 34:42.410
-[Margot coughs]
-Look! Ready?

34:42.494 --> 34:43.705
Ready?

34:44.373 --> 34:45.458
[Margot gasps and coughs]

34:45.542 --> 34:47.462
Margot! Honey, are you okay?

34:47.546 --> 34:49.007
Can you breathe?

34:49.091 --> 34:51.095
Deep breath, nice and slow.

34:51.178 --> 34:54.059
[Margot coughing]

34:54.142 --> 34:55.311
I'm okay, I am, really.

34:55.395 --> 34:56.940
-Breathe easy.
-I'm okay. Thanks.

34:57.023 --> 34:59.529
[coughs] I'm okay.

35:07.168 --> 35:08.922
-[engine starts]
-[hip-hop music playing]

35:09.005 --> 35:11.176
Hey, James! James!

35:11.260 --> 35:12.095
[tires screech]

35:12.178 --> 35:13.515
[car thuds]

35:14.182 --> 35:15.435
[music stops]

35:16.019 --> 35:17.230
Isaiah!

35:17.313 --> 35:18.859
I'm so sorry, okay?

35:18.942 --> 35:21.071
That's my bad. I just came running
to try and find you.

35:21.155 --> 35:22.365
-For what?
-It's an emergency.

35:22.449 --> 35:24.327
You have to see these! James!

35:24.411 --> 35:25.413
See what?

35:26.331 --> 35:27.543
What?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.045
Ja-- Ja-- James, these were the photos

35:29.129 --> 35:30.256
I took of Allison and Margot.

35:30.339 --> 35:31.843
The ones I took in the house,

35:31.926 --> 35:33.012
before it actually happened,

35:33.095 --> 35:34.431
which is impossible, James!

35:34.515 --> 35:35.893
Slow down. What're you saying?

35:35.976 --> 35:37.521
I'm saying this camera
is haunted, okay?

35:37.605 --> 35:39.065
It's a haunted camera, James,

35:39.149 --> 35:40.401
and you gotta believe me!

35:40.485 --> 35:42.363
Because you found it in the basement
where the kid died.

35:42.447 --> 35:44.075
Yes.

35:44.159 --> 35:45.788
Yes, that-- that is exactly
what I'm saying.

35:45.871 --> 35:47.123
[James]
Okay, that makes sense.

35:47.207 --> 35:49.002
Can I see the camera?

35:49.085 --> 35:50.756
-Please?
-Yes, but be careful, okay?

35:50.839 --> 35:53.427
There's some cursed devil
stuff going on there.

35:53.512 --> 35:54.680
Okay?

35:55.808 --> 35:58.103
-[shutter clicks]
-[camera whirs]

35:58.187 --> 36:00.191
Why... Why would you do that, man?

36:00.274 --> 36:01.401
That's not cool!

36:01.485 --> 36:03.824
'Cause there is no such thing
as a cursed camera, dude!

36:03.907 --> 36:05.869
That isn't real!
Wanna know what is real?

36:05.953 --> 36:08.542
The scratch on my brand
new fully-loaded Rubicon.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.589
This, it was on back order
for like a year, dude!

36:11.673 --> 36:12.800
Now I have to text my mom!

36:13.760 --> 36:15.388
[car door thuds]

36:15.471 --> 36:17.977
[creepy music]

36:40.354 --> 36:42.066
-Hey, Margot?
-Hey.

36:42.150 --> 36:43.945
Hey, I was just gonna drop off my stuff

36:44.029 --> 36:45.782
so I could come see you and...

36:45.866 --> 36:48.538
Thank you so much for saving my life.

36:48.622 --> 36:50.834
I still can't believe that
I picked the wrong bar.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.170
That's never happened.

36:53.673 --> 36:55.969
-Hey, is something wrong?
-Yeah...

36:56.053 --> 36:57.932
Can you take a look
at this for me, please?

36:59.225 --> 37:00.562
Huh.

37:01.856 --> 37:04.277
Oh, man, you just don't want me
to show anyone, do you?

37:04.361 --> 37:06.908
-What is wrong with you, man?
-Why are you talking to that camera?

37:06.991 --> 37:08.995
Because it's trying to ruin my future.

37:09.079 --> 37:11.458
-What?
-Well, it's the reason why you choked.

37:11.542 --> 37:14.464
No, I choked because I ate the wrong bar.

37:14.548 --> 37:16.803
No, no, it's the same thing
that happened to Allison.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.890
And if I play in tomorrow night's game,

37:18.973 --> 37:20.519
I'm gonna be this thing's next victim.

37:20.602 --> 37:22.063
But, Margot, if I don't play,

37:22.146 --> 37:24.401
the scouts skip me over
and I don't get my scholarship.

37:25.612 --> 37:27.156
So what I'm saying is either way,

37:27.240 --> 37:28.367
this thing has got me trapped.

37:30.413 --> 37:32.417
I could just really use
your help with this.

37:33.377 --> 37:34.714
I don't believe this.

37:34.797 --> 37:36.008
I know how crazy it sounds.

37:36.091 --> 37:38.555
No, not that. This, us.

37:39.724 --> 37:42.020
I thought you were actually
coming to check up on me,

37:42.103 --> 37:43.898
to see how I was doing for a change.

37:43.982 --> 37:46.612
But as usual, you made it about you again.

37:46.696 --> 37:49.117
You always make it about you and...

37:49.200 --> 37:51.246
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you right now,

37:51.329 --> 37:53.459
but I can't be the person
that you always come to

37:53.543 --> 37:55.212
-when you have problems.
-I know.

37:56.048 --> 37:57.885
I know, and I'm sorry,
but I swear, this is different.

37:57.968 --> 38:01.601
No, no. You're gonna have
to solve this one on your own.

38:01.684 --> 38:03.730
Okay? I'm done.

38:07.696 --> 38:10.451
[breathes heavily]

38:11.996 --> 38:14.543
[tense music]

38:22.475 --> 38:24.772
You can't hurt me if you don't exist.

38:27.820 --> 38:30.074
Mm-mm. This is what you get.

38:30.867 --> 38:32.913
[shouting]
I'm gonna play that game,

38:32.996 --> 38:36.754
I'm gonna win that game,
and there's nothing you can do about it!

38:53.453 --> 38:54.874
Come on! Yeah!

38:55.499 --> 38:56.961
Now let's go. [roars]

38:57.044 --> 38:58.798
[Isaiah]
Titans, let's go! Let's go!

39:07.816 --> 39:11.031
Whoo, all right!
That's our offense, come on!

39:11.114 --> 39:12.784
Six more, baby,
six more! Come on!

39:12.868 --> 39:14.580
One-eighty!

39:14.663 --> 39:15.749

39:24.892 --> 39:26.269
Yeah!

39:26.353 --> 39:27.564
That's what I'm talking about!

39:29.359 --> 39:31.321
Isaiah's on fire tonight!

39:36.707 --> 39:38.418
[announcer]
That ends the first half,

39:38.503 --> 39:41.007
and your Port Lawrence
Titans are up by six.

39:42.468 --> 39:43.428
[players clamoring]

39:43.513 --> 39:44.598
What did I tell you, huh?

39:44.682 --> 39:45.767
-What'd I tell you?
-You tell me!

39:45.850 --> 39:47.562
-Didn't I say this is our year?
-Yes, sir!

39:47.646 --> 39:48.898
Didn't I say this is our time?

39:48.982 --> 39:50.777
-[players] Yeah!
-Didn't I say the glory days

39:50.860 --> 39:52.739
are right there at our fingertips?

39:52.823 --> 39:55.160
-[players] Yeah!
-Now y'all better hold 'em up!

39:55.244 --> 39:56.413
-That's right!
-[Coach Rifkin] Okay,

39:56.496 --> 39:57.498
we still got another half!

39:57.582 --> 39:59.503
Let's get out there,
keep up the intensity,

39:59.586 --> 40:00.922
and finish strong!

[direful music continues]

40:20.002 --> 40:21.630
Okay, get out there.

-Go on!
-[players shouting]

40:23.175 --> 40:24.469

-Coach, take me out!
-You just went in!

40:26.097 --> 40:28.185
-Please!
-Let's go!

40:28.268 --> 40:30.189
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah!

40:34.072 --> 40:35.407
What's the plan?

40:35.491 --> 40:37.579
[Isaiah]
Oh, uh, uh, uh...

40:37.662 --> 40:38.831
O-- okay, right, right.

40:38.915 --> 40:40.459
Right now, it's not about plays,

40:40.543 --> 40:42.547
it's about goals, okay?

40:42.631 --> 40:44.885
-Right now, what's our goal?
-To win.

40:44.968 --> 40:47.557
No. Your goal is to protect the QB.

40:47.641 --> 40:50.270
Okay? That's your new goal.

40:50.354 --> 40:52.734
That's not the goal.
Our goal is definitely always to win.

40:52.818 --> 40:53.903
Generally, that is the goal.

40:53.986 --> 40:56.742
But right now, your new goal
is to protect me,

40:56.826 --> 40:59.038
even if it means we lose, okay?

40:59.122 --> 41:01.167
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Yes, it does make sense!

41:01.251 --> 41:02.838
It does! It makes perfect sense!

41:02.921 --> 41:04.550
[whistle blows]

41:04.633 --> 41:05.927
[players groaning]

41:07.096 --> 41:08.683
[grunts]
Have you lost your mind?

41:08.766 --> 41:10.687
Get your head in the game!

41:10.770 --> 41:13.860
Damn it! What the heck
are you doing out there?

41:13.943 --> 41:17.241
[announcer]
Delay of game! Offense, Number 11.

41:17.324 --> 41:19.580
Five-yard penalty. Still first down.

41:19.663 --> 41:22.293
Far north 24-slot!

Call the snap, Isaiah!

41:36.237 --> 41:38.283
[demonic voice]
Call the snap, Isaiah!

41:39.327 --> 41:40.370
Oh, screw this!

42:20.660 --> 42:22.079
-Somebody please stop the game!
-[Lucas] Mom.

42:22.162 --> 42:24.166
-Please, somebody stop the game!
-Mom, what's wrong?

42:24.250 --> 42:26.379
-Something's wrong.

42:36.399 --> 42:37.902
Get away from me!

-[terrifying music stops]
-Isaiah! Isaiah!

42:46.795 --> 42:48.256
Don't move. Don't move.

42:48.340 --> 42:50.720
-Oh! Oh, my God.
-Look at me, son. Look at me.

42:50.803 --> 42:52.974
Medic! Get a stretcher!

42:54.060 --> 42:55.938
-No, don't. Just look at me.
-Just breathe.

42:56.022 --> 42:58.151
Isaiah, just breathe. Help is on the way.

42:58.234 --> 42:59.738
-[Isaiah gasps]
-[Ben] Look at me. Look at me.

42:59.821 --> 43:01.575
[Isaiah screams]

43:01.658 --> 43:02.702
Stay down!

43:02.786 --> 43:03.913
[Isaiah whimpering]

43:03.996 --> 43:05.332
Look at me, look at me!

43:07.169 --> 43:08.296
Oh, my God.

43:16.730 --> 43:18.274
How you doin', champ?

43:18.358 --> 43:20.070
-Did we win?
-Yeah.

43:20.153 --> 43:22.074
But... not that it matters.

43:22.157 --> 43:24.203
-I just talked to the doctor.
-Yeah?

43:24.286 --> 43:27.042
And she said, based on
your age and the X-rays,

43:27.126 --> 43:29.004
doctor feels real optimistic.

43:29.088 --> 43:31.552
If you really get after
your physical therapy,

43:31.635 --> 43:33.889
you could make a full recovery,

43:33.973 --> 43:35.308
probably won't even miss a step.

43:35.392 --> 43:36.687
Okay, but did she mention a timetable?

43:36.770 --> 43:39.066
Oh, well, it's gonna

six to eight months.

43:51.048 --> 43:53.011
That's gonna knock
me out for the season, Dad.

I'll miss my scholarship window.

the scholarship, all right?

on all our children.

44:42.652 --> 44:44.573

44:45.282 --> 44:46.618
I saw Biddle!

44:47.954 --> 44:49.874
He's come back, Ben.

44:49.958 --> 44:52.462
He's come back to make us pay
for what we did to him.
