ZAK: Do you know
what's happening right now?

00:04.405 --> 00:05.804
It's ready to have fun
with us.

00:05.806 --> 00:06.905
GREG:
Are you the one that did it?

00:07.908 --> 00:10.576
-Are you all right, Zak?
-Huh?

00:10.578 --> 00:11.910
Are you all right?

00:11.912 --> 00:14.046
SPERA: She's responsible for
the death of a young man.

00:14.048 --> 00:17.349
-[ Gasps ] Oh, what?
-Annabelle the Doll.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.484
Dude, I'm burning up, bro.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.120
Would you like
to have a heart attack?

00:21.122 --> 00:22.755
Because that can happen.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.289
I just want to touch her
so bad.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.358
No, the doll is trying
to take control.

ZAK:
There are things in this world

00:34.335 --> 00:36.635
that we will never
fully understand.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.437
[<i> Distorted</i> ]<i> Understand.</i>

00:38.439 --> 00:41.240
[ Echoing ] We want answers.

00:41.242 --> 00:44.309
We have worked years to build
our credibility,

00:44.311 --> 00:47.813
our reputation,

00:47.815 --> 00:51.350
and in honor of
this special Halloween season,

00:51.352 --> 00:53.986
I invite all of you
to step inside

00:53.988 --> 00:57.022
my Haunted Museum
in Las Vegas...

00:57.024 --> 00:58.757
Do you want me,
Annabelle?

01:01.662 --> 01:04.830
...as we search for evidence

01:04.832 --> 01:09.268
behind "Ghost Adventures:
Annabelle's Curse."

01:09.270 --> 01:13.305
¶¶

01:13.307 --> 01:15.174
¶¶

01:15.176 --> 01:17.843
Are you guys ready
for a Halloween

01:17.845 --> 01:22.881
unlike anything that
you've ever seen before?

01:22.883 --> 01:26.652
Since becoming an investigator
so many years ago,

01:26.654 --> 01:30.122
I have worked to prove
the existence of the paranormal

01:30.124 --> 01:34.059
and unexplained
to as many people as possible.

01:34.061 --> 01:37.830
That's why I am opening
a museum in Las Vegas,

01:37.832 --> 01:40.299
so that people from
all over the world

01:40.301 --> 01:41.667
can come face-to-face

01:41.669 --> 01:44.636
with absolute proof
of the Other Side

01:44.638 --> 01:47.739
through direct experiences
with amazing...

01:47.741 --> 01:49.741
<i>Dr. Jack Kevorkian's van.</i>

01:49.743 --> 01:51.743
...world-renowned artifacts...

01:51.745 --> 01:54.146
<i>Ed Gein's cauldron.</i>

01:54.148 --> 01:58.116
...which three lucky fans
will come face-to-face with

01:58.118 --> 02:00.752
to test their fears and beliefs.

02:00.754 --> 02:05.157
But first, I want to see
what happens when I introduce

02:05.159 --> 02:09.027
this already-incredibly
haunted collection

02:09.029 --> 02:10.896
to one of the most famous

02:10.898 --> 02:14.166
and dangerous artifacts
in the world.

02:14.168 --> 02:19.972
There's one object that I've
always been intrigued about.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.040
I've always wanted
to be near it.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.475
Annabelle.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.678
In 1970, the Annabelle Doll

02:26.680 --> 02:29.381
was gifted to a nursing student

02:29.383 --> 02:31.016
who soon noticed that the doll

02:31.018 --> 02:34.319
would mysteriously
change position

02:34.321 --> 02:37.523
and she began to find
written pleas for help

02:37.525 --> 02:41.126
scattered around the apartment.

02:41.128 --> 02:44.496
After a man who touched
the doll was punished

02:44.498 --> 02:46.164
with a physical attack,

02:46.166 --> 02:49.167
the infamous
Ed and Lorraine Warren

02:49.169 --> 02:52.604
determined that the doll was
obviously possessed

02:52.606 --> 02:57.075
by something demonic.

02:57.077 --> 03:00.546
We are getting ready
to meet Tony Spera.

03:00.548 --> 03:04.783
Tony is the son-in-law
to Lorraine Warren

03:04.785 --> 03:09.855
and the current owner
of Annabelle the Doll.

03:09.857 --> 03:15.027
He has never allowed
an investigation

03:15.029 --> 03:19.765
of Annabelle before
on a television show.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.833
¶¶

03:21.835 --> 03:23.368
This is a historic moment

03:23.370 --> 03:27.873
for Annabelle and for us.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.976
It's kind of like meeting
a serial killer

03:30.978 --> 03:32.878
without the handcuffs on.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.081
¶¶

03:36.083 --> 03:37.349
-How you doing?
-Good.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.984
-How are you, Zak?
-Nice to meet you.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.385
Pleased to meet you,
as well.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.155
What I brought tonight
is probably

03:43.157 --> 03:46.291
the most dangerous object
that we have in the museum

03:46.293 --> 03:47.960
back in Connecticut.

03:47.962 --> 03:52.397
I made the trek here, Zak,
because you asked me to.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.766
I appreciate that.
Normally, I wouldn't do it,

03:54.768 --> 03:57.336
but I know that a lot
of people watch your show.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.204
We're going to talk
about Annabelle

03:59.206 --> 04:01.773
and the dangers
within her,

04:01.775 --> 04:05.344
to show people that evil
exists and evil's real.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.347
The holy water you
requested is on standby.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.148
-Okay.
-Why do we need the holy water?

04:10.150 --> 04:12.351
I want you to tell me
and everyone watching this.

04:12.353 --> 04:16.455
Okay, well, the holy water
is for the crew, you, me,

04:16.457 --> 04:18.590
for protection.

04:18.592 --> 04:23.061
¶¶

04:23.063 --> 04:26.465
Just before Tony
introduces me to Annabelle,

04:26.467 --> 04:29.468
I am suddenly overcome
with a strange feeling

04:29.470 --> 04:32.037
of confusion
and disorientation.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.973
It's difficult to focus
or even form words,

04:34.975 --> 04:37.542
let alone conduct an interview.

04:37.544 --> 04:40.545
But I have to speak
with Tony to find out

04:40.547 --> 04:44.216
if he is familiar with
any of these symptoms.

04:44.218 --> 04:45.550
Tony?

04:45.552 --> 04:49.454
I just want to know if,
has anybody ever experienced

04:49.456 --> 04:50.722
anything before
they were getting ready

04:50.724 --> 04:52.991
to go meet her
or anything?

04:52.993 --> 04:54.393
Yeah.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.062
Yeah, that's what we call
a "forerunner."

04:57.064 --> 04:59.097
It's a warning.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.900
Annabelle doesn't want us
to show her.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.002
-Right.
-So she is affecting you.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.304
-Yeah.
-Let's walk over there.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.873
Where did it happen?

05:07.875 --> 05:12.844
To be exact,
it was right about here.

05:12.846 --> 05:16.248
We did our interview
and then I'm walking up here

05:16.250 --> 05:18.383
and then, boom,
it hit me right here.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.718
What exactly did you feel?

05:19.720 --> 05:22.287
It was just like something
just hit through my chest,

05:22.289 --> 05:23.622
in the center of my chest,

05:23.624 --> 05:26.191
and then I kind of went
like that a little bit.

05:26.193 --> 05:29.428
I didn't feel influence,
like any negativity,

05:29.430 --> 05:32.097
to where like, you know,
you get rage or anything.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.232
It was nothing like that.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.333
It's just weird.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.502
It's just strange to me
that this...

05:37.504 --> 05:38.537
That happened
right here, too.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.238
...on the way to meet her.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.175
¶¶

05:43.177 --> 05:46.411
In this field, I have
to document everything,

05:46.413 --> 05:49.114
even though that, yeah, this
could be maybe something medical

05:49.116 --> 05:50.482
or I don't know.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.584
-Well, you know, I --
-It's just strange.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.386
Now, I'm getting just
kind of really weird,

05:54.388 --> 05:55.287
you know what I mean?

05:55.289 --> 05:57.089
I think -- I think it

05:57.091 --> 06:00.325
shows us the power
of Annabelle,

06:00.327 --> 06:03.962
the power of evil.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.364
Though I am beginning
to feel more like myself

06:06.366 --> 06:08.767
and finally ready
to meet with Annabelle,

06:08.769 --> 06:12.671
there is yet another
surprising delay,

06:12.673 --> 06:15.707
when our audio technician
Mike alerts me

06:15.709 --> 06:17.809
that during
the last conversation

06:17.811 --> 06:19.544
with Tony in the hallway,

06:19.546 --> 06:24.549
he noticed a strange audio
anomaly within the recording.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.754
We decide to immediately
play it back for review.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.989
Will you let us know
if this was you

06:30.991 --> 06:33.425
or like a --
a breathing or --?

06:33.427 --> 06:34.926
-I'll let you know.
-Okay.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.362
But there's no --
Hold on, let me...

06:37.364 --> 06:38.363
So right here, right?

06:38.365 --> 06:39.631
<i>It's just -- it's strange.</i>

06:39.633 --> 06:40.766
<i>Now, I'm getting</i>
<i>just kind of...</i>

06:40.768 --> 06:42.067
<i>[ Voice whines ]</i>
<i>...really weird,</i>

06:42.069 --> 06:43.068
<i>you know what I mean?</i>
<i>-I think --</i>

06:43.070 --> 06:44.035
What the hell?

06:44.037 --> 06:45.437
Okay, what was it?
What was it?

06:45.439 --> 06:46.671
Turn it up.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.540
What was it, Mike?

06:48.542 --> 06:51.042
It's just -- it's strange.
Now, I'm getting just kind of

06:51.044 --> 06:52.544
really weird,
you know what I mean?

06:52.546 --> 06:53.879
-I think it's --
-Can you hear it?

06:53.881 --> 06:55.247
Yeah, it's not me.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.749
It's not me,
no, it's not me.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.252
It's just -- it's strange.
Now, I'm getting just kind of

07:00.254 --> 07:01.720
really weird,
you know what I mean?

07:01.722 --> 07:02.521
I think it --

07:02.523 --> 07:03.922
That proves it right there.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.724
I think we need
to go meet her.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.125
Is the holy water in there?

07:07.127 --> 07:08.927
The holy water is in there.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.564
¶¶

07:12.566 --> 07:16.968
Do you know
what's happening right now?

07:16.970 --> 07:19.738
It's ready to have fun
with us.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.239
MIKE: It's already starting.

07:21.241 --> 07:25.377
It's mimicking what it wants
to do, what we think it is.

07:25.379 --> 07:29.314
I need to soak my hands
in holy water.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.484
I need to say some prayers

07:32.486 --> 07:35.687
around Annabelle.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.422
There's one.

07:37.424 --> 07:41.693
The doll was possessed
by an inhuman spirit

07:41.695 --> 07:45.530
and it would mimic
and mock a little girl.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.799
This is blessed holy water
from a priest.

07:47.801 --> 07:52.204
Name of the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.106
A human spirit is not going
to possess a doll.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.743
Name of the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

07:58.745 --> 08:01.513
An inhuman demon is going
to possess a doll

08:01.515 --> 08:05.183
to trick the living into
thinking it's a little kid.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.953
"St. Michael the Archangel,
defend us in battle.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.955
Be our safeguard against
the wickedness

08:09.957 --> 08:11.423
and snares of the Devil.

08:11.425 --> 08:14.192
May God rebuke him,
we humbly pray,

08:14.194 --> 08:16.661
by the power of God,
thrust into hell Satan,

08:16.663 --> 08:18.430
and all the evil spirits,

08:18.432 --> 08:21.800
who wander through the world
for the ruin of souls.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.702
Amen."

08:23.704 --> 08:25.337
This is the doll.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.038
I'm not going to
hold her for long.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.174
This is her.

08:29.176 --> 08:35.347
¶¶

08:35.349 --> 08:36.948
Okay.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.251
Okay, you can bring them in
if you'd like now.

08:39.253 --> 08:42.854
¶¶

08:42.856 --> 08:46.591
It's time to meet
Annabelle.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.594
This is Annabelle,
right here.

08:49.596 --> 08:52.497
Now, Zak, before we do
anything, here's the holy water.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.332
I want you to use
your right hand.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.402
You're going to go,
The Father, Son...

08:57.404 --> 08:58.703
Father, the Son...

08:58.705 --> 09:01.139
The Holy Ghost.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.608
¶¶

09:03.610 --> 09:06.678
She's responsible for
the death of a young man.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.313
Do you want me,
Annabelle?

09:17.040 --> 09:24.412
¶¶

09:24.414 --> 09:26.815
We are in my Las Vegas museum,

09:26.817 --> 09:30.485
and I am finally going to meet
the world's most haunted doll,

09:30.487 --> 09:32.687
Annabelle.

09:32.689 --> 09:34.122
Am I allowed
to touch her?

09:34.124 --> 09:35.523
No. Oh, no.

09:35.525 --> 09:36.624
Don't touch her.

09:36.626 --> 09:38.693
Do not touch her.

09:38.695 --> 09:40.829
She's responsible for
the death of a young man

09:40.831 --> 09:43.598
who came to our --
our cult museum in Connecticut.

09:44.634 --> 09:48.269
Ed Warren was giving
a small tour of the museum

09:48.271 --> 09:52.173
to some college kids,
and one was about 19 years old.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.409
He came with his girlfriend
on a motorcycle.

09:54.411 --> 09:57.712
Ed was talking about
what happened with this doll,

09:57.714 --> 10:01.549
that a young man
had slashes put on him.

10:01.551 --> 10:03.284
When he gets to that point,

10:03.286 --> 10:07.055
the college student
runs up to the glass case,

10:07.057 --> 10:11.593
starts banging on the case,
says, "This is a bunch of bull.

10:11.595 --> 10:16.231
If that doll can put slashes on
anybody, do it to me right now."

10:16.233 --> 10:19.167
Ed said, "Son, you and your
girlfriend got to leave."

10:19.169 --> 10:22.437
He challenged what was
in that doll, right?

10:22.439 --> 10:24.639
Three hours later, though,
that 19-year-old man

10:24.641 --> 10:27.175
was -- was dead.

10:27.177 --> 10:30.178
They were laughing and joking
about that doll,

10:30.180 --> 10:32.280
when he lost total control
of the bike

10:32.282 --> 10:34.549
and straight on into a tree.
He was killed instantly.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.316
[ Tires squeal ]

10:35.318 --> 10:38.253
[ Metal crashes ]

10:38.255 --> 10:42.457
By touching her,
what are you doing?

10:42.459 --> 10:45.827
You are opening that door
to the other realm,

10:45.829 --> 10:48.329
to the preternatural realm.

10:48.331 --> 10:50.565
We've opened one
too many doors already.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.833
Yeah, and by opening
that door up,

10:51.835 --> 10:54.402
what happens is you can
never close the door.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.838
Can we at least...

10:56.840 --> 11:01.009
creek it open?

11:01.011 --> 11:04.579
Right now, is an historic
moment on this Halloween,

11:04.581 --> 11:09.150
for the very first time
ever allowed on television,

11:09.152 --> 11:14.489
we are investigating
the real Annabelle Doll.

11:14.491 --> 11:17.859
We have Tony back
at Nerve Center.

11:17.861 --> 11:21.830
The only way that we are allowed
to investigate Annabelle

11:21.832 --> 11:25.200
is if he is able to watch
Annabelle at all times

11:25.202 --> 11:29.070
and make sure that we do not
make contact with her.

11:29.072 --> 11:32.140
As we enter the area
where Annabelle is sitting on

11:32.142 --> 11:33.808
a chair in my doll room,

11:33.810 --> 11:35.376
I notice flickering lights

11:35.378 --> 11:37.312
coming from
my fortune-telling machine

11:37.314 --> 11:39.714
that's within about
10 feet of Annabelle.

11:39.716 --> 11:42.183
So I decide to unplug
the machine.

11:42.185 --> 11:45.453
It's under that back one.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.122
<i>-The electricity --</i>
-What the...?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.224
Why did it say that?

11:49.226 --> 11:51.693
There is no way
that it can say that.

11:51.695 --> 11:53.261
Let me just show you
right now.

11:53.263 --> 11:56.464
What did it say?
That takes a quarter
for that to talk.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.032
-Yeah.
-What the hell?

11:58.034 --> 12:00.735
And you heard what it said?
"Electricity."

12:00.737 --> 12:02.770
The disturbing part
about this is,

12:02.772 --> 12:05.406
I never say the word
"electricity"

12:05.408 --> 12:08.309
in my main recording
that comes on after you

12:08.311 --> 12:10.645
deposit a quarter
into the machine.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.480
Also, the word "electricity"

12:12.482 --> 12:16.651
will mean something shocking
to me within the next 24 hours.

12:16.653 --> 12:21.022
And as I look over to my left,
I see a terrifying face.

12:21.024 --> 12:22.790
-Wow.
-And what -- what did it say?

12:22.792 --> 12:24.192
-Something about --
-Feel this?

12:24.194 --> 12:26.528
-Yes. Yes.
-Oh, my God.

12:26.530 --> 12:28.363
It's something about
the electricity, it said.

12:28.365 --> 12:29.597
Yeah, something about
the electrify. I -- I --

12:29.599 --> 12:31.933
There's no way
that it could talk.

12:31.935 --> 12:35.203
As we are feeling this energy,
within just a few feet

12:35.205 --> 12:36.504
from us in the doll room,

12:36.506 --> 12:39.941
we capture a strange anomaly
close to Annabelle.

12:43.113 --> 12:46.814
Okay, so right now,
we are going to go inside

12:46.816 --> 12:50.051
this little doll room
where Annabelle is

12:50.053 --> 12:54.789
and we're going to try
to communicate with "Annabelle,"

12:54.791 --> 12:56.257
who's actually a...

12:56.259 --> 12:58.359
-Uh-huh.
-...inhuman spirit.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.794
[<i> Indistinct</i> ]
Did you hear that?

12:59.796 --> 13:01.896
I swear I just heard
something.

13:08.471 --> 13:11.172
Aaron, make sure you
do not touch Annabelle.

13:11.174 --> 13:12.974
I'm coming in.

13:12.976 --> 13:15.843
We're in a pitch-black room

13:15.845 --> 13:19.280
with the real-life
Annabelle the Doll

13:19.282 --> 13:23.618
in a room already filled
with haunted dolls.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.553
When you think about all
the millions of people

13:25.555 --> 13:29.223
that show fear from Annabelle,
Ed and Lorraine Warren,

13:29.225 --> 13:31.693
the notoriety
she's gotten from them

13:31.695 --> 13:33.595
and then now from the --
Oh, God!

13:33.597 --> 13:35.997
Now, feel that.
Aaron, come here!

13:35.999 --> 13:37.131
-Whoa.
-Yes.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.967
Dude, I'm telling you
right now --

13:38.969 --> 13:40.935
Don't touch her, dude,
don't touch her.

13:40.937 --> 13:43.171
All the millions of people
that have fear,

13:43.173 --> 13:44.906
just by saying her name
every day,

13:44.908 --> 13:47.375
over and over and over, every
time a new movie comes out,

13:47.377 --> 13:50.345
all of this fear
for Annabelle, this doll,

13:50.347 --> 13:53.348
it can empower her
just from all that.

13:53.350 --> 13:56.284
ZAK: As I theorize about
how this evil spirit

13:56.286 --> 13:59.320
within Annabelle
harnesses its dark powers,

13:59.322 --> 14:01.189
the strong energy returns,

14:01.191 --> 14:04.292
only this time it's
directly beneath the doll.

14:04.294 --> 14:05.093
Put your hand right there.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.728
-What is that?
-Exactly.

14:06.730 --> 14:09.364
I immediately place
the Spirit Box down here

14:09.366 --> 14:13.668
and we receive a voice with
an absolutely disturbing tone.

14:13.670 --> 14:16.437
-It's under her.
<i>-Listen.</i>

14:16.439 --> 14:18.406
It's under her.

14:18.408 --> 14:20.408
Under her.

14:20.410 --> 14:22.310
Under her.

14:22.312 --> 14:25.880
After I ask, "Who are
we supposed to listen to?"

14:25.882 --> 14:28.416
We receive this...

14:28.418 --> 14:29.684
<i>-Annabelle.</i>
-I heard it.

14:29.686 --> 14:31.185
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah, it said, "Annabelle."

14:31.187 --> 14:32.520
-A man's voice.
-A man's voice.

14:32.522 --> 14:34.188
"Annabelle."
Like that.

14:34.190 --> 14:35.023
-Oh, wow.
-A man's voice.

14:35.025 --> 14:36.224
I heard that.

14:37.727 --> 14:41.796
I heard it.

14:41.798 --> 14:45.667
We decide to move Annabelle away
from these other haunted dolls

14:45.669 --> 14:48.202
so that we can focus
on the visual aspects

14:48.204 --> 14:49.704
of our investigation.

14:49.706 --> 14:53.908
We aim multiple cameras at her,
including the thermal camera,

14:53.910 --> 14:55.510
the full-spectrum camera,

14:55.512 --> 14:57.578
the structured light
sensor camera,

14:57.580 --> 15:00.248
and then we began trying
to make further communication

15:00.250 --> 15:02.784
by using our talking EVP machine

15:02.786 --> 15:06.154
designed by electrical engineer,
Bill Chappell.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.789
What do you want,
Annabelle?

15:07.791 --> 15:09.624
<i>-You.</i>
-What'd it say?

15:09.626 --> 15:11.459
-"You."
-It said, what?

15:11.461 --> 15:13.795
You said, "What do you want,
Annabelle?", and it says, "You."

15:13.797 --> 15:15.363
I swear, it says, "You."

15:15.365 --> 15:16.898
Oh, wow.

15:21.905 --> 15:23.738
Are you all right, Zak?

15:23.740 --> 15:25.039
I just want to touch her
so bad.

15:25.041 --> 15:27.875
No, don't.

15:33.974 --> 15:41.714

15:41.716 --> 15:44.483
ZAK: We are investigating
the Annabelle doll

15:44.485 --> 15:47.252
in my Las Vegas Haunted Museum

15:47.254 --> 15:49.922
and just like in the 1970s,

15:49.924 --> 15:53.158
she seems intent
on making contact.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.727
AARON: You said, "What do
you want, Annabelle?",

15:54.729 --> 15:57.496
and it says, "You."
I swear, it says, "You."

15:57.498 --> 16:00.966
Oh, wow.

16:00.968 --> 16:03.502
Do you want me,
Annabelle?

16:03.504 --> 16:05.871
"Us."

16:05.873 --> 16:08.707
-She's using that device.
-"Us." "Us."

16:08.709 --> 16:10.509

16:10.511 --> 16:12.277
You want us?

want with us, Annabelle?

16:20.254 --> 16:21.353
SPERA: Be careful, Zak.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.390
Are you using the ground,
Annabelle?

16:24.392 --> 16:25.958
[<i> Indistinct</i> ]

16:25.960 --> 16:28.060
Whoa, I just heard, "rugh."

16:28.062 --> 16:29.294
Huh?

16:29.296 --> 16:30.696
I just heard like a, rugh,
like, sound, like --

16:30.698 --> 16:33.499
like a snarl, like
animal sound, I swear.

16:33.501 --> 16:35.868
Are you using the ground,
Annabelle?

16:38.105 --> 16:40.472
Whoa.

16:40.474 --> 16:44.743
Whoa, I just heard, rugh.

16:48.849 --> 16:54.520
Zak, right now, oh, my God.
You had two skeletons on you.

16:54.522 --> 16:57.790
You had your mapped figure,
two figures over top each other,

16:57.792 --> 16:59.191
and then one went...

16:59.193 --> 17:01.593
Oh, my God.
It's on your shoulder.

17:01.595 --> 17:03.162
It's standing on top of you.

17:03.164 --> 17:05.697
It keeps going between
you and the doll.

17:05.699 --> 17:08.133
I'm not -- I'm not joking
around with you right now.

17:08.135 --> 17:09.968
It was just standing up
on top of your shoulder,

17:09.970 --> 17:12.237
a little figure,
and then back into you,

17:12.239 --> 17:15.340
and then from your stick figure
into her stick figure,

17:15.342 --> 17:16.608
I swear to God.

17:16.610 --> 17:19.578
Annabelle, was that what
you were meaning by "us"?

17:19.580 --> 17:22.514
We capture something that
we've never captured before,

17:22.516 --> 17:24.349
using the SLS camera.

17:24.351 --> 17:26.185
As I'm whispering to Annabelle,

17:26.187 --> 17:29.421
my body is being mapped
by a skeletal figure,

17:29.423 --> 17:30.789
as it should be.

17:30.791 --> 17:35.627
But then, all of a sudden,
a second unknown skeletal figure

17:35.629 --> 17:38.063
also appears inside my body.

17:38.065 --> 17:40.098
This second unknown
skeletal figure

17:40.100 --> 17:43.368
then transfers itself
from me to Annabelle.

17:43.370 --> 17:47.473
Next, it's as if this figure
jumps back out of Annabelle,

17:47.475 --> 17:50.776
hovers behind me,
and then behind her,

17:50.778 --> 17:53.212
before getting on
top of my shoulders.

17:53.214 --> 17:56.782
I believe our equipment is
detecting the evil spirit

17:56.784 --> 17:58.317
inside Annabelle,

17:58.319 --> 18:04.056
leaving her to find something
or someone else to possess.

18:04.058 --> 18:06.492
-Are you all right, Zak?
-Huh?

18:06.494 --> 18:09.127
-Are you all right?
-Man, I can feel

18:09.129 --> 18:11.129
a lot of energy
right in front of me.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.532
It is now that
I start zoning out.

18:13.534 --> 18:16.969
Everything feels weird around me
and I know this sounds crazy,

18:16.971 --> 18:20.672
but I feel connected to
Annabelle and protective of her

18:20.674 --> 18:24.643
and her stick figure keeps
jumping in and out of me.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.144
I just want to touch her
so bad.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.914
-No. Don't.
-Don't touch, man.

18:28.916 --> 18:31.083
SPERA: Don't touch the doll,
whatever you do.

18:31.085 --> 18:33.652
It's probably
trying to entice you.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.988
I know, Tony, but I just
feel like I want to.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.789
Do not touch the doll.

18:37.791 --> 18:40.959
If you do, you're inviting
evil right to you.

18:40.961 --> 18:42.394
I'll accept it.

18:42.396 --> 18:44.463
-No.
-No. Don't do it.

18:44.465 --> 18:46.832
I just feel a connection with
her right now, though, Tony.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.300
I feel a connection with her.

18:48.302 --> 18:51.904
It's starting to map the doll.
The doll's now mapped, Zak.

18:51.906 --> 18:53.772
Zak, don't.

18:53.774 --> 18:56.408
I'll have to abort this whole
thing if you continue that,

18:56.410 --> 18:58.210
because it's affecting
your behavior.

18:58.212 --> 19:00.445
I'm burning up, guys.
I'm serious.

19:00.447 --> 19:01.914
Like, look at the sweat
on my forehead.

19:01.916 --> 19:04.082
Aaron. I feel like --
like I have a fever.

19:04.084 --> 19:07.252
I think at this point,
we should abort.

19:07.254 --> 19:08.520
Dude, I'm burning up, bro.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.689
It's getting to the point
now where the doll

19:10.691 --> 19:12.357
is trying to take control.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.526
You can see what it did
to Zak.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.796
It's time to put that doll
back in the case.

19:17.798 --> 19:19.698
Oh, my God.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.199
It says, "Ann."

19:21.201 --> 19:24.336
If all of this evidence
isn't enough already

19:24.338 --> 19:27.439
to add to Annabelle's legend
of being a haunted doll,

19:27.441 --> 19:32.210
we yet again receive her name
on another communication device.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.780
She's trying to take
control of us.

19:34.782 --> 19:37.449
I feel like I have
a fever of 105.

19:37.451 --> 19:39.217
I'm like, sweating
like crazy.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.285
It was cold in here.

19:40.287 --> 19:41.453
ZAK: Tony, please.
Can I give you --?

19:41.455 --> 19:42.921
I'll give you
anything you want.

19:42.923 --> 19:45.357
Can I please just,
just hold her once?

19:45.359 --> 19:48.093
You are playing right into
the hands of the demonic.

19:48.095 --> 19:51.296
She wants me to grab her, Tony.
She wants me to. She's --

19:51.298 --> 19:53.565
I want you to say
to yourself right now,

19:53.567 --> 19:58.737
"God, protect me, God,
stop me from thinking this way."

19:58.739 --> 20:01.406
I don't want to say that
to myself right now.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.708
I'm going to come in
and take the doll.

20:02.710 --> 20:03.475
I want a priest.

20:03.477 --> 20:04.776
She wants me to grab her.

20:04.778 --> 20:07.045
It says, "God."
It says, "God," right now.

20:07.047 --> 20:09.147
-Are you serious?
-Nope, it says, "God."

20:09.149 --> 20:12.384
As Tony is telling me
to ask God for protection,

20:12.386 --> 20:15.654
a talking EVP device that's
aimed directly at Annabelle,

20:15.656 --> 20:17.656
says the word "God."

20:17.658 --> 20:19.625
God is your protector,
remember that, Zak.

20:19.627 --> 20:22.127
If you touch the doll, Zak,
all bets are off.

20:22.129 --> 20:24.630
I cannot guarantee your
safety in the future.

20:24.632 --> 20:26.965
Would you like to be
in a car accident?

20:26.967 --> 20:30.002
Have a heart attack?
Because that could happen.

Do not touch
[bleep] doll.

20:33.474 --> 20:35.474
-Whoa. That said...
-"Jesus"!

20:44.043 --> 20:50.447
¶¶

20:50.449 --> 20:53.017
ZAK: The world-renowned
Annabelle doll

20:53.019 --> 20:55.286
is inside my Haunted Museum,

20:55.288 --> 20:59.056
and although she has harmed
other men who have touched her,

20:59.058 --> 21:03.093
I can't help but feel
an almost irresistible urge

21:03.095 --> 21:06.697
to reach out and make
direct physical contact.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.400
SPERA: If you touch the doll,
Zak, all bets are off.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.169
After Tony tells me
not to touch the doll,

21:12.171 --> 21:15.639
it seems Annabelle commands me
to do the opposite

21:15.641 --> 21:18.976
as the talking EVP device
suddenly says...

21:18.978 --> 21:20.344
<i>-"Grab."</i>
-..."grab foot."

21:20.346 --> 21:22.379
BILLY: You know what this
talking EVP just said?

21:22.381 --> 21:23.714
-What?
-"Grab."

21:23.716 --> 21:25.215
-"Foot."
-What'd it say?

21:25.217 --> 21:27.351
-"Foot."
-It's trying to tempt you,

21:27.353 --> 21:28.519
but you're stronger
than that.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.687
I understand, but there
was a moment there

21:29.689 --> 21:31.121
where I was sitting next to it

21:31.123 --> 21:33.257
and it was just like
I was connected to her.

21:33.259 --> 21:34.558
Of course.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.327
In that whole moment,
I felt nothing but goodness

21:36.329 --> 21:38.062
and just happiness and sadness.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.163
There was no evil.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.332
You're not alone, Zak.
It is inside of you.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.666
You need to have it...

21:46.706 --> 21:48.972
Why would you do that?

21:48.974 --> 21:51.475
Did he do it?

21:51.477 --> 21:52.843
Did he touch it?

21:52.845 --> 21:54.478
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:54.480 --> 21:59.083
Don't touch the doll.
Do not touch [bleep] doll.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.651
-All right.
-Okay?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.453
Because if you touch
the doll, Zak,

22:02.455 --> 22:03.854
you're going to be
in spiritual danger.

22:12.932 --> 22:16.233
Tony is very angry
and removes Annabelle.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.902
Once he returns, I feel
the need to confess

22:18.904 --> 22:20.604
that I grabbed the doll's foot.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.040
It was weird. I wasn't
expecting it, trust me.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.508
There was a weird
connection there.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.410
She told me to grab her.

22:26.412 --> 22:27.678
She told you to grab her?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.612
Yes.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.114
You know what that is,
right?

22:30.116 --> 22:32.683
That's their way of getting
you to touch 'em, like I said.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.219
I think I grabbed her foot
on accident.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.687
When?

22:36.689 --> 22:39.757
I don't -- like,
I don't remember doing it,

22:39.759 --> 22:41.492
but then again, I do.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.494
Is there something
I can do to reverse it,

22:43.496 --> 22:45.129
just in case I did do it?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.864
And honestly,
if I did do it,

22:46.866 --> 22:48.365
it was a subconscious thing

22:48.367 --> 22:50.834
and I didn't mean
any disrespect, Tony.

22:50.836 --> 22:52.436
All right.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.204
'Cause I'm so already in like,
this weird, confused state.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.373
BILLY: Stop for a second,
stop talking.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.509
You have a double skeleton
again,

22:58.511 --> 23:00.177
and it just left your body.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.846
ZAK: Again, a second,
unexplained figure

23:02.848 --> 23:05.616
appears in my body,
and as I'm telling Tony

23:05.618 --> 23:08.419
about my state of confusion,
it leaves my body,

23:08.421 --> 23:11.288
then appears behind us
as a smaller figure

23:11.290 --> 23:13.257
before disappearing completely.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.292
I still believe the evil entity

23:15.294 --> 23:17.661
that possesses
Annabelle has left her

23:17.663 --> 23:21.398
and is currently roaming free
inside of the Haunted Museum.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.901
The question is, will it
return to the doll

23:23.903 --> 23:27.204
before Tony abruptly
takes it away?

23:27.206 --> 23:30.541
What if the entity that
possesses Annabelle stays here?

23:30.543 --> 23:31.809
That's what I'm saying.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.744
That doll is evil.
That doll is bad.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.280
There's no innocent --
innocence at all.

23:36.282 --> 23:39.783
Dude, I feel like
something's not right with me.

23:39.785 --> 23:42.619
You're not acting normal.
Dude, he needs something.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.688
Saying like, I need
to bless myself.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.590
<i>-"Jesus."</i>
-Did that just say --?

23:46.592 --> 23:47.825
-Whoa!
-That says...

23:47.827 --> 23:49.293
"Jesus"!

23:49.295 --> 23:53.430
Oh, my God.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.732
ZAK: As our investigation
comes to an end

23:55.734 --> 23:58.602
and Tony heads back
to his hotel with Annabelle,

23:58.604 --> 24:00.737
I start to become
very affected,

24:00.739 --> 24:02.873
while also having
violent thoughts.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.775
-What's wrong with you?
-You look weird.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.110
And as I make
the difficult drive home,

24:07.112 --> 24:10.614
I arrive at my house and make
a rather ironic discovery.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.883
I'm just pulling into
my house here

24:12.885 --> 24:16.019
from filming
with Annabelle.

24:16.021 --> 24:18.455
And look at my odometer.

24:18.457 --> 24:23.293
6,666 miles.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.362
Then, the next day,
as I meet my friend

24:25.364 --> 24:27.264
for lunch at a local cafe,

24:27.266 --> 24:30.834
we are sitting outside
when a freak thunderstorm hits

24:30.836 --> 24:33.770
and a bolt of lightning
strikes a light pole

24:33.772 --> 24:36.373
within just a few feet
from my car.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.810
My hairs on my arm
stand up a split-second

24:39.812 --> 24:41.345
before a lightning bolt

24:41.347 --> 24:44.414
hits the light right there
where that white mark is.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.283
And if you look where
the white mark is,

24:46.285 --> 24:48.886
it's right where my car is.

24:48.888 --> 24:52.089
Has Annabelle already sent me
her first warning

24:52.091 --> 24:56.360
through the form of a powerful
electric lightning strike?

24:56.362 --> 25:01.465
<i>-The electricity --</i>
-"The electricity," it said.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.535
After the storm clouds clear
and this new day

25:04.537 --> 25:06.770
turns once more into night,

25:06.772 --> 25:09.940
I return to prepare
for the three fans

25:09.942 --> 25:11.542
who will face their fears

25:11.544 --> 25:16.246
by stepping inside
the Haunted Museum.

25:16.248 --> 25:20.584
-Oh, man.
-This is going to be sick.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.119

yourself into?

25:30.796 --> 25:31.895
-Yes.
-Probably not.

25:31.897 --> 25:33.163
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.832
Yeah.

Oh, my...
Look, skulls.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.847
Well, I hope you know
what you got yourself into.

25:50.849 --> 25:52.349
-I'm ready.
-There's a message

25:52.351 --> 25:53.884

-Hey.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.482
-Martin.
-Yep.

Are you guys ready for this?

27:00.919 --> 27:03.787

27:03.789 --> 27:06.723
-Oh, absolutely.
-Oh, yeah.

27:06.725 --> 27:09.259
Greg, I want you to,
real quick,

27:09.261 --> 27:11.928
something weird
happened with you?

27:11.930 --> 27:14.898
You visited the museum
once before on the outside.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.534
You took a photo or something?
What happened?

27:17.536 --> 27:19.569
GREG: Stopped by here,
we took a couple pictures.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.938
And about 1:00 in the morning,
I got an alert.

27:21.940 --> 27:25.676
Couple of my friends liked the
picture I posted on Facebook.

27:25.678 --> 27:29.246
The problem is, I didn't
post anything on Facebook.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.847
I clicked on it,
and son of a gun,

27:30.849 --> 27:33.684
it was the picture
I took of the clown tree.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.752
¶¶

27:35.754 --> 27:39.589
And it had the caption,
"You can call it."

27:39.591 --> 27:41.024
The caption said,
"You can call it,"

27:41.026 --> 27:42.392
and you didn't ever
write that.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.928
I didn't select you,
the spirits here did, obviously.

27:44.930 --> 27:45.862
Yeah.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.297
You guys are here
for a reason.

27:47.299 --> 27:52.836
Everything that you heard over
there is very, very serious.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.638
In this building,

27:54.640 --> 27:58.008
I have personally seen
people drop to the ground

27:58.010 --> 28:00.210
and not know
what their names are

28:00.212 --> 28:03.714
and they can't answer
the question.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.515
This is Dakota Laden.

28:05.517 --> 28:10.687
Dakota won our fan contest
about five years ago.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.624
And he came in and did
a lockdown back in Charleston.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.927
He just started doing
camera for us,

28:16.929 --> 28:20.864
just doing interviews and stuff
like that a few months ago.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.200
¶¶

28:23.202 --> 28:26.570
And while he was here filming,

28:26.572 --> 28:28.438
he got scratched
on his back

28:28.440 --> 28:31.274
during another moment
in this museum.

28:34.980 --> 28:38.682
I'm just telling you, this isn't
just a haunted attraction.

We are here to make
contact with you.

ZAK: Greg, Martin, and Alex will
now enter the Haunted Museum

29:02.766 --> 29:04.766
from three separate doors

29:04.768 --> 29:09.037
so that they will begin their
investigations entirely alone.

29:09.039 --> 29:10.672
We will be watching
and listening

29:10.674 --> 29:13.475
to their every move
from a secret Nerve Center

29:13.477 --> 29:15.978
hidden inside
the Haunted Museum.

to do something to me.

29:49.213 --> 29:52.481
This must be where you are.

29:52.483 --> 29:55.017
ZAK: Because Greg is still
seeking answers

29:55.019 --> 29:58.987
as to how this photo he took
of the clown tree outside

29:58.989 --> 30:02.357
was mysteriously posted
to his Facebook page,

30:02.359 --> 30:06.561
I find it ironic that he is now
asking a clown mannequin

30:06.563 --> 30:09.965
if<i> it</i> is the one
who posted the photo.

30:09.967 --> 30:13.802
How are you?
Are you the one that did it?

through my museum,

he finds Alex, and they continue
their investigation together.

Yes, there is.

He and Alex have no idea
that just a few nights ago,

31:24.274 --> 31:26.875
Father Sebastian was staring
into this mirror

31:26.877 --> 31:28.677
when he suddenly collapsed,

31:28.679 --> 31:32.381
while his partner was also
severely marked on her neck.

31:32.383 --> 31:34.816
Without disclosing
these full details,

31:34.818 --> 31:37.319
I warn them that
the mirror's cursed,

31:37.321 --> 31:39.121
but they open
its curtains anyway.

[ Gasps ]

31:43.093 --> 31:45.927
Wow.
Bela Lugosi's mirror.

31:45.929 --> 31:49.264
The legend behind this
is unbelievable.

31:49.266 --> 31:50.332
People see things in it.

31:50.334 --> 31:53.702
[ Gasps ] Holy.
They do see things.

31:53.704 --> 31:56.772
So, come on. We're here.

31:56.774 --> 32:01.977
We're here.

32:01.979 --> 32:05.347
So is it a scrying mirror?

32:05.349 --> 32:07.983
All of a sudden,
for the first time tonight,

32:07.985 --> 32:10.252
Greg's demeanor
changes immediately

32:10.254 --> 32:12.621
after he starts
challenging the mirror,

32:12.623 --> 32:15.624
which is exactly what
Father Sebastian was doing

32:15.626 --> 32:17.159
right before he fainted.

32:43.687 --> 32:46.621
Did you?

32:46.623 --> 32:49.958
But it went away
pretty quick.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.928
And I'm not going
to be intimidated.

32:52.930 --> 32:55.864
What makes this moment
very chilling is that seconds

32:55.866 --> 32:58.700
before Greg and Alex
drew open the curtain

32:58.702 --> 33:00.402
to the Bela Lugosi mirror,

33:00.404 --> 33:02.237
an unexplained light anomaly

33:02.239 --> 33:05.207
appears to shoot
directly into it.

33:05.209 --> 33:08.176
We debunk this as not
being a flying insect,

33:08.178 --> 33:11.813
as you can see it vanishes
mid-screen into the mirror.

33:11.815 --> 33:13.548
With Greg being affected,

33:13.550 --> 33:17.052
the energy now turns
its focus on Alex.

33:17.054 --> 33:21.623
I feel like I keep seeing
something right here.

Don't touch her, touch me!

33:34.972 --> 33:38.840
[ Gasps ] Oh, man.
My chest got really tight.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.709

right over here, huh?

33:40.711 --> 33:42.310
Something right here
in the mirror, huh?

33:42.312 --> 33:44.479
Oh, my God, I got
goosebumps everywhere.

33:44.481 --> 33:47.816
Just as Alex is feeling
a tightness in her chest,

33:47.818 --> 33:50.385
as well as static energy
all around her,

33:50.387 --> 33:53.121
the same light anomaly
that shot into the mirror

33:53.123 --> 33:57.959
is now captured manifesting
directly out of her chest.

34:00.898 --> 34:02.030
There's something right here

34:02.032 --> 34:03.832
between these two rooms
in the hallway.

34:19.650 --> 34:23.151
Just stand right here
for a second.

34:23.153 --> 34:24.419
I thought you were
right behind me

34:24.421 --> 34:26.054
and I thought you were
like breathing on my neck

34:26.056 --> 34:29.057
and it wasn't you.

34:29.059 --> 34:31.459
Aaron now takes Martin
down into the basement

34:31.461 --> 34:33.228
to do some Spirit Box sessions

34:33.230 --> 34:36.598
where dark rituals
took place in the 1970s

34:36.600 --> 34:38.400
and where recently Bloody Mary

34:38.402 --> 34:40.969
performed several
voodoo rituals.

34:40.971 --> 34:44.072
I then lock Alex inside
of the funeral parlor.

34:44.074 --> 34:47.108
I'm going to let you know
exactly what's going on in here

34:47.110 --> 34:48.476

34:48.478 --> 34:51.212
This room is so pitch-black
that she cannot tell

there are two caskets
containing human skeletons,

one of which was discovered
in the attic

another session like that.

have to leave?

while Bloody Mary was down
here conducting dark rituals?

the name "David Cook,"

to identify itself.

-Light blue, wasn't it?
-It was blue.

41:39.256 --> 41:42.824
It was right here,
now it's gone, dude.

41:42.826 --> 41:45.393
¶¶

41:45.395 --> 41:48.363
A thunderstorm and a bolt
of lightning,

41:48.365 --> 41:51.833
a balloon that pursues me
at the height of a child,

41:51.835 --> 41:54.569
or perhaps, a doll's height.

41:54.571 --> 41:57.873
It's clear that I formed
a connection with Annabelle.

41:57.875 --> 42:01.042
Whether part of her remains
here is yet to be seen.
