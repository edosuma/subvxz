WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:02.792
Previously, on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

00:02.792 --> 00:04.292
We're lucky to have a new
addition to our team.

00:04.292 --> 00:08.292
Welcome her with open arms.

00:08.292 --> 00:09.334
This is Scarlett.

00:09.334 --> 00:11.125
Hey, Scarlett, nice to meet you.

00:11.125 --> 00:12.501
Do you need a hand
with luggage or stuff?

00:12.501 --> 00:14.667
Do you wanna check on that?

00:14.667 --> 00:16.292
Out of my way!

00:16.292 --> 00:18.501
Keely Washburn... last year,
she chartered PIII

00:18.501 --> 00:21.751
with Erica Rose,
and I think Jess was here.

00:21.751 --> 00:23.542
These ladies are ready
for lots of sailing

00:23.542 --> 00:26.375
-and dinner with the captain.
-Yeah!

00:26.375 --> 00:28.000
-You shagged Ashley.
-No, I did not.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.751
-Own it and control it.
-I will own it, I never...

00:30.751 --> 00:33.209
If someone wants to deny the
fact that anything happened,

00:33.209 --> 00:36.584
but I remember the ----ing
penis in my vagina.

00:36.584 --> 00:38.667
So clingy, and just so childish.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.375
Oh sh--.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.292
[vomits]

00:42.292 --> 00:43.959
Have you worked on a
charter boat before?

00:43.959 --> 00:46.000
-Just days.
-Oh, okay.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.959
Knowing that Scarlett
has no experience

00:48.959 --> 00:51.042
is giving me life right now.

00:51.042 --> 00:53.751
Daisy, have you given any
thought into second stew?

00:53.751 --> 00:56.584
Not this again.

00:56.584 --> 00:58.584
I have more
experience than her.

00:58.584 --> 01:01.626
This title bullsh--
needs to stop.

01:01.626 --> 01:26.250
But I think you're missing
the teamwork aspect.

01:26.250 --> 01:30.501
I want you to work
as a team and get this...

01:30.501 --> 01:32.209
this hierarchy out of your head.

01:32.209 --> 01:33.792
Until you figure that out,

01:33.792 --> 01:36.417
the two of you are gonna
be the same.

01:36.417 --> 01:40.167
And concentrate on working
as a team, the three of us.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.083
After what I went through
with Ashley and Gabriela,

01:42.083 --> 01:43.751
what did you ----ing expect?

01:43.751 --> 01:45.584
Ashley may be
unhappy about this,

01:45.584 --> 01:49.083
but being second stew isn't
always about experience.

01:49.083 --> 01:52.584
It's about character, and at
the moment, Ashley isn't there.

01:52.584 --> 01:54.000
We're working great together.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Good.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.209
Turning over a new leaf, Daisy.

01:56.209 --> 01:57.542
I'm happy to hear it.

01:57.542 --> 01:59.626
Trying to, I'm really trying.

01:59.626 --> 02:01.292
Good, good, good.

02:01.292 --> 02:03.792
So, Kels, you're gonna be
on days this trip.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.626
Okay.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.167
Yeah, I mean, I haven't been
on days since charter three.

02:08.167 --> 02:10.584
So, just vinegar
with paper towel

02:10.584 --> 02:12.083
on all the mirrors
and stainless.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.375
-Okay.
-Hey, big B.

02:13.375 --> 02:14.792
Yes.

02:14.792 --> 02:19.542
You're gonna be on
nights this trip, okay?

02:19.542 --> 02:21.250
-Twelve at night?
-Yeah.

02:21.250 --> 02:24.542
Oh, wow. Hmm.

02:24.542 --> 02:26.751
I am really annoyed
about the night shift.

02:26.751 --> 02:29.125
I mean, it's great you don't
have to do very much,

02:29.125 --> 02:31.083
but ultimately it's so boring.

02:31.083 --> 02:34.417
Wouldn't it make sense to have
the exciting guy in the day,

02:34.417 --> 02:39.375
that's gonna make your guests
happy and make the tip bigger,

02:39.375 --> 02:41.209
Somebody's done a
[bleep]-up here.

02:41.209 --> 02:43.167
It looks like this one's
wrong already.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.375
-That one's definitely wrong.
-That one, we didn't touch.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.959
Just so you know,
Ashley isn't second stew.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.250
-Okay.
-They're both the same.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.959
-Okay.
-I want her to learn teamwork.

02:50.959 --> 02:57.667
-That's better.
-Yeah.

02:57.667 --> 03:01.250
-How's it going, ladies?
-It's going well, how are you?

03:01.250 --> 03:02.667
Yeah?
Good.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.459
Sh--, look how clean
this place looks, wow.

03:04.459 --> 03:06.459
Yawn, over it.

03:06.459 --> 03:07.792
Are you ready
to listen to my problems?

03:07.792 --> 03:10.000
-Yeah.
-There's a lot of them.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.417
It's gonna take you all day.

03:11.417 --> 03:14.042
Hey... no, I've got
no ----ing problems.

03:14.042 --> 03:15.501
Get away.

03:15.501 --> 03:17.167
So, we're gonna stop
being childish, Ash.

03:17.167 --> 03:18.459
Oh, Gary.

03:18.459 --> 03:21.083
We should all just
kiss and make up.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.417
No, I haven't.

03:22.417 --> 03:23.792
That's what friends do,
don't they?

03:23.792 --> 03:26.626
It makes everything better.

03:26.626 --> 03:28.542
-It does.
-Yeah. Yeah.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.792
That's quite romantic.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.667
Okay, Gary.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.000
Okay, ladies,
I'll see you later.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.125
-Bye.
-Bye, bye, bye.

03:36.125 --> 03:40.083
Gary... he is fun
to flirt with. I love it.

03:40.083 --> 03:42.417
But there's tension with Ashley,
and I don't want any drama.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.959
Like, I feel like
I have to keep it good.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.209
It's so annoying.

03:46.209 --> 03:48.375
Gary's such a ----ing loser.

03:48.375 --> 03:49.375
[sighs]

03:49.375 --> 03:51.042
Fair warning.

03:51.042 --> 03:55.375
All crew, all crew,
provisions are here.

03:55.375 --> 03:58.167
Hey, Marcos, que pasa, dulce?

03:58.167 --> 04:00.042
-How you doing?
-Hi, Marcos, good morning.

04:00.042 --> 04:01.334
-Morning, guys?
-How are you doing, my love?

04:01.334 --> 04:03.167
-Finally.
-Candy.

04:03.167 --> 04:04.542
Oh, seriously?

04:04.542 --> 04:06.751
Oh, you guys are so naughty.

04:06.751 --> 04:08.417
-Finished.
-Yay! Yay.

04:08.417 --> 04:09.584
Thanks.

04:09.584 --> 04:11.292
I don't know if these'll fit,

04:11.292 --> 04:13.375
but ginger beer
for Moscow Mules.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.042
It's on her
preference sheet, so...

04:15.042 --> 04:16.709
Okay.

04:16.709 --> 04:18.167
So, you're on nights?

04:18.167 --> 04:19.167
-Yeah.
-Are you nervous?

04:19.167 --> 04:21.125
-No.
-Good.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.584
It's more that I'll be bored.

04:22.584 --> 04:25.626
-Oh, you stay pretty busy.
-Yeah.

04:25.626 --> 04:27.584
You've gotta come for
these windows.

04:27.584 --> 04:28.792
Yeah.

04:28.792 --> 04:30.000
All right, you
start on that end?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.292
Okay.

04:31.292 --> 04:37.000
Wait, let me just do
this top bit.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.792
-Can you speed up a bit?
-No.

04:39.792 --> 04:43.751
Come on, you can definitely
walk faster than that.

04:43.751 --> 04:47.751
Is it wrong of me to think
I work harder than Barnaby?

04:47.751 --> 04:50.209
â™ª Sugar pie, honey pop

04:50.209 --> 04:53.709
I think Barnaby does enough to
get by and get the job done,

04:53.709 --> 04:57.667
whereas I put in effort to
make sure everything's done,

04:57.667 --> 04:59.083
like, with a cherry on top.

04:59.083 --> 05:01.000
Can't relate.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.459
Oh, you're so good at that.

05:02.459 --> 05:05.584
I'm good at most
things that I do.

05:05.584 --> 05:06.834
You missed one.

05:06.834 --> 05:07.834
You can do that one.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.209
Are you kidding me?

05:09.209 --> 05:10.334
You've done all of
them except one.

05:10.334 --> 05:14.083
I think we're about there.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.542
I'm gonna keep you
on mids this charter.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.000
So, what you're gonna
do is probably, like,

05:18.000 --> 05:19.792
-8:00 till midnight.
-Okay.

05:19.792 --> 05:22.375
I'll keep Ashley on lates,
and I'll do earlies.

05:22.375 --> 05:23.626
You'll do dinner
with me tonight,

05:23.626 --> 05:24.626
Ashley will do turn-downs.

05:24.626 --> 05:26.167
Okay.

05:26.167 --> 05:27.751
And tomorrow,
you'll do turn-downs.

05:27.751 --> 05:31.209
How is it having the extra
set of hands again today?

05:31.209 --> 05:34.167
Do you feel like...

05:34.167 --> 05:37.000
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.792
It'll be her first
overnight charter.

05:38.792 --> 05:39.792
Oh, really?

05:39.792 --> 05:41.375
She does day charters, mostly.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.042
Yeah, that is pretty crazy.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.626
I feel like after this
charter is under my belt,

05:45.626 --> 05:48.167
like, the next one's will
just be, like, smooth sailing.

05:48.167 --> 05:50.000
Honestly, it's easy,
it's not hard?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.417
It's easy, Ashley, isn't it?

05:52.417 --> 05:53.459
-I think we're done.
-Yeah?

05:53.459 --> 05:55.292
Yeah, I think we're good.

05:55.292 --> 05:59.292
Cool, so just be ready in your
uniform for quarter to 1:00.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.083
-Quarter to 1:00?
-Yeah.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.417
All crew, all crew,
one hour until guest arrival.

06:03.417 --> 06:05.167
Please suit up, thank you.

06:05.167 --> 06:09.459
All right, let's have a
little walkaround... nice.

06:09.459 --> 06:11.375
You wipe that with a
wet chamois,

06:11.375 --> 06:14.042
and then we're good.

06:14.042 --> 06:23.792
Bed looks great.

06:23.792 --> 06:30.792
Ah, God.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.167
Hey, what happened to your face?

06:32.167 --> 06:33.792
-The flavor-saver.
-Yeah.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.584
The French tickler.

06:35.584 --> 06:37.375
No, that's the French
tickler, down here.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.459
-Oh, is that the French tickler?
-I think so, yeah.

06:38.459 --> 06:39.792
This is the flavor saver, okay.

06:39.792 --> 06:41.000
Let's do this sh--
one more time.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Three more times.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.250
Yeah.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.417
Just give that a
quick wipe with a...

06:44.417 --> 06:45.959
-Chamois.
-...a dry chamois.

06:45.959 --> 06:47.292
-Don't... don't...
-Okay.

06:47.292 --> 06:48.584
Yeah, don't even touch
the rest of it.

06:48.584 --> 06:51.125
Oh, just the person
I'm looking for.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.417
How are you?

06:52.417 --> 06:55.584
I'm good, thanks.

06:55.584 --> 06:58.167
How's your day going, getting
your head around everything?

06:58.167 --> 06:59.792
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

06:59.792 --> 07:01.417
-It'll take a little bit.
-Yeah, I'll get there.

07:01.417 --> 07:02.792
Yeah.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.417
I'm actually just looking
for some shorts,

07:04.417 --> 07:06.125
because I don't think
I have many shorts.

07:06.125 --> 07:09.083
Come, stop that for a second,
stop that for a second.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.334
-Stop that!
-What?

07:10.334 --> 07:12.250
Ooh!

07:12.250 --> 07:14.167
You know, I don't know
what it is about Scarlett

07:14.167 --> 07:15.501
that I'm attracted to.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.042
I mean, she's definitely
flirting with me,

07:17.042 --> 07:18.834
and I'm gonna flirt back

07:18.834 --> 07:26.334
because I'm quite
a flirtatious person.

07:26.334 --> 07:28.167
See ya.

07:28.167 --> 07:30.459
I'm thinking to myself, this
girl should not be a yachtie,

07:30.459 --> 07:35.000
she should be a supermodel.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.000
Whew. I'm sweating.
I'm sweaty.

07:35.000 --> 07:55.501
Previously, on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

07:55.501 --> 07:57.709
All crew, all crew,
let's get everybody

07:57.709 --> 07:58.709
up into the cockpit, please.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.167
Copy.

08:00.167 --> 08:02.125
Ready, let's smash
this charter.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.459
I'm sweating.
There are sparks.

08:04.459 --> 08:10.667
I think it's exciting.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.375
Okay, that already
looks way better.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.125
You get the towels first,

08:14.125 --> 08:16.250
and then Ashley will be at
the end with the champagne.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.292
Everybody out of my way.

08:18.292 --> 08:19.459
Is the 'stache
gonna stay the whole trip,

08:19.459 --> 08:20.792
or is it gonna get shaved off?

08:20.792 --> 08:23.667
Ugh, why do you have
that on your face, Gary?

08:23.667 --> 08:25.334
Like, you literally couldn't
look any creepier

08:25.334 --> 08:27.167
-than you do right now.
-[laughing]

08:27.167 --> 08:29.417
Here we go.

08:29.417 --> 08:30.584
That 'stache.

08:30.584 --> 08:32.334
Why, is it that bad?

08:32.334 --> 08:33.667
I thought it was quite...
I thought I was quite cute.

08:33.667 --> 08:34.751
Look at us,
it's perfect timing.

08:34.751 --> 08:36.209
I'm starting to feel the swamp.

08:36.209 --> 08:37.751
My butt is so sweaty.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.584
-Hey, ladies.
-Hi! Hello!

08:39.584 --> 08:40.792
-Good to see you again.
-Good to see you.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.375
Good to see you again.
How are...

08:42.375 --> 08:43.709
-Gimme a hug.
-Okay, let's do a hug.

08:43.709 --> 08:44.751
Good to see you.

08:44.751 --> 08:46.375
Is there anything in my teeth?

08:46.375 --> 08:47.751
-Hi, I'm Scarlett.
-Hello, I'm Gary.

08:47.751 --> 08:49.083
Scarlett, nice to meet you.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.584
Hello. Gary.

08:50.584 --> 08:52.626
-Kelsie, nice to meet you.
-Are you gonna hug me?

08:52.626 --> 08:54.250
Yeah, of course, come on!

08:54.250 --> 08:55.792
-Hi, I'm Barnaby.
-Nice to meet you.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.334
-Hi.
-Can we just chug this?

08:57.334 --> 08:59.792
Later.

08:59.792 --> 09:02.167
Well, it's really nice
to see some familiar faces,

09:02.167 --> 09:05.209
and especially nice
to see some new faces.

09:05.209 --> 09:07.375
The last time we had
an all-female charter,

09:07.375 --> 09:10.375
it was, um, challenging.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.667
Since we got here,
you've been making fun of me.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.792
Just pull put your
bathing suit on, Erica.

09:13.792 --> 09:14.792
Titties for Trump.

09:14.792 --> 09:16.250
Oh, my God.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.959
She's making America
great again.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.542
I hope this time everyone'll be
able to have better manners.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.167
I'm gonna hand
you over to Daisy,

09:22.167 --> 09:23.250
who's gonna take you
on the tour.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.626
Thank you.

09:24.626 --> 09:26.709
If you wanna follow me up
to the fly bridge.

09:26.709 --> 09:28.626
All right, bitches, let's go.

09:28.626 --> 09:29.792
Yeah.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.626
Up here, we've got the sky deck,

09:31.626 --> 09:35.876
which is a nice area
to lay out in the sun.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.375
I need an umbrella.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.584
-It is hot.
-Huh?

09:38.584 --> 09:39.751
-It's hot.
-What?

09:39.751 --> 09:42.334
-It's hot!
-Oh, yeah.

09:42.334 --> 09:44.709
So, in here we've
got the main saloon,

09:44.709 --> 09:45.709
which is obviously a bit cooler.

09:45.709 --> 09:47.209
Beautiful.

09:47.209 --> 09:49.167
If you wanna follow me
down to the cabins.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.918
Ooh, this is gonna give me
a nice little leg workout.

09:50.918 --> 09:52.375
One more big one.

09:52.375 --> 09:53.918
In here, we've got
the master cabin,

09:53.918 --> 09:55.209
and then you've got
the two twin cabins,

09:55.209 --> 09:56.584
which are the exact same.

09:56.584 --> 09:58.417
Linda, you can sleep
looking at yourself.

09:58.417 --> 09:59.751
You'll be really happy.

09:59.751 --> 10:01.167
Does this one have
the most mirrors?

10:01.167 --> 10:05.709
-Is that it?
-That's it.

10:05.709 --> 10:07.125
Keely, what time would
you like dinner?

10:07.125 --> 10:08.626
8:30?

10:08.626 --> 10:10.375
And would you like to
talk to him about the menu,

10:10.375 --> 10:11.667
or are you happy for him to...

10:11.667 --> 10:13.542
-He can do whatever he wants.
-Okay.

10:13.542 --> 10:16.167
Okay, guys,
I'm ready to drop lines.

10:16.167 --> 10:17.667
Pull, pull, pull,
pull, pull, pull.

10:17.667 --> 10:18.709
-This one next.
-You can go.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.167
Pull in.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.375
Okay, that's all
lines clear, Glenn.

10:21.375 --> 10:22.375
Thank you.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.209
Ooh, we're moving.

10:24.209 --> 10:27.792
Chicken, fig, and crispy bacon
with a pear-wine reduction.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.709
Okay, Wendy and Debbie, smile.

10:29.709 --> 10:32.876
-Besties for the resties.
-Yes.

10:32.876 --> 10:36.417
It's chicken with fig, crispy
bacon, and a wine reduction.

10:36.417 --> 10:38.667
I grew up on Lunchables
and freezer mac and cheese.

10:38.667 --> 10:39.792
-Stop.
-I'm not kidding.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.584
No!

10:41.584 --> 10:43.334
-That is excellent. Beautiful.
-That's really good.

10:43.334 --> 10:45.542
Jess is like, I need to go
compliment the chef personally.

10:45.542 --> 10:47.334
So, we can definitely
go sailing now?

10:47.334 --> 10:53.209
Well, you can see the flag
is just barely moving.

10:53.209 --> 11:11.250
Yeah.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.125
I enjoy being on days.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.709
-Marcos, 8:30 dinner.
-Yeah.

11:14.709 --> 11:18.542
They said that you are free
to make whatever you want.

11:18.542 --> 11:20.209
Good thing, they give me
a green light.

11:20.209 --> 11:21.584
Yeah.

11:21.584 --> 11:23.167
These charter guests
are super really picky.

11:23.167 --> 11:25.501
The primary guest
is gluten-free,

11:25.501 --> 11:27.250
two of them don't eat shellfish,

11:27.250 --> 11:33.626
another two,
they're dairy-free.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.792
My options are getting smaller
and smaller and smaller.

11:35.792 --> 11:38.417
So, to make a menu,
it's not easy.

11:38.417 --> 11:41.125
She can eat lobster,
she can eat lobster,

11:41.125 --> 11:44.292
she can eat lobster,
she can eat lobster...

11:44.292 --> 11:46.292
the rest don't like it.

11:46.292 --> 11:47.792
Oh, my gosh,
I drank that way too fast.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.000
I'm not letting
her have too much.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.709
Get outta here, Mother.

11:51.709 --> 11:59.584
Okay, Colin, let her go,
let her go, let her go.

11:59.584 --> 12:01.125
Actually, we have a
competition

12:01.125 --> 12:02.375
to see who can irritate
Daisy the most?

12:02.375 --> 12:05.250
No. No. Absolutely not.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.584
Okay, fine, I'll play
by myself, then.

12:07.584 --> 12:09.667
That's three shots at
the waterline there.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.167
That looks like
a pretty good bite to me.

12:12.167 --> 12:13.792
That's fine, and we're done.

12:13.792 --> 12:16.292
Daisy, do you think we could
set up that rope swing?

12:16.292 --> 12:17.334
Yeah, sure.

12:17.334 --> 12:18.417
What? I don't want 50.

12:18.417 --> 12:23.876
Well, now it's too late.

12:23.876 --> 12:31.584
It's ----ing hot today here.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.667
Yeah.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.542
Are we doing the table like
that, or is that just after?

12:36.542 --> 12:37.709
It's dinner.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.459
Who's ready to rope swing?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.125
You may have to do it
first to show us.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.375
No, I'll definitely do
it first, yeah.

12:42.375 --> 12:44.792
Because I am way too scared.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.501
Run as fast as you can.

12:47.501 --> 12:50.667
Woo! Ah!

12:50.667 --> 12:52.667
Oh, my God!

12:52.667 --> 12:55.918
I don't even know if my little
legs can take me far enough.

12:55.918 --> 12:59.083
-You got this.
-Run, run, run!

12:59.083 --> 13:00.250
Holy sh--.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.709
[laughing]

13:01.709 --> 13:03.375
Put your other hand above it...
that's it.

13:03.375 --> 13:06.876
You ready, Gary?

13:06.876 --> 13:09.083
Run, run, run, run,
run, run, run!

13:09.083 --> 13:12.292
-Ah!
-Let go, let go, let go!

13:12.292 --> 13:14.125
And let's go, like,
all the way back here,

13:14.125 --> 13:15.792
and then just literally run.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.459
Go for it, Jen.

13:17.459 --> 13:21.334
-Oh, no.
-Oh!

13:21.334 --> 13:23.250
False start.

13:23.250 --> 13:26.250
Just make sure she can see you,
and then she'll get incentive.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.876
-I am shaking.
-Jen.

13:27.876 --> 13:32.292
-Three...
- Two, one!

13:32.292 --> 13:33.709
-Go!
-Yes!

13:33.709 --> 13:36.667
-Woohoo!
-Keep going!

13:36.667 --> 13:38.334
Oh!

13:38.334 --> 13:40.375
Ow! Ow!

13:40.375 --> 13:41.584
-You okay?
-You all right?

13:41.584 --> 13:43.584
She went with a splash.

13:43.584 --> 13:44.709
Did you get that
on your phone?

13:44.709 --> 13:46.167
I did.

13:46.167 --> 13:48.167
You could just add that
to the shared album.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.876
No, I don't... I think I'm gonna
have to just delete that one.

13:49.876 --> 13:54.375
And that's how we stopped
halyard swings on Parsifal III.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.751
Coming up...

13:55.751 --> 13:57.667
Gary, do you really need a stew
for drinks?

13:57.667 --> 14:00.834
We've got one reason to be here,
and it's to ----ing work.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.584
There's guests unattended,

14:02.584 --> 14:05.876
Daisy, we're here
for the guests.

14:05.876 --> 14:08.584
Oh, you're ----ing...

14:08.584 --> 14:08.584
Asshole.

14:08.584 --> 14:12.876
All crew, all crew,
let's get everybody

14:12.876 --> 14:15.918
Would anybody else like to go?

14:15.918 --> 14:17.375
-No thanks.
-Are you sure?

14:17.375 --> 14:18.834
-Yeah, no thanks.
-Hundred percent?

14:18.834 --> 14:20.292
Yep, 100%.

14:20.292 --> 14:23.459
All right, I'm gonna go shower.

14:23.459 --> 14:24.959
Barnaby, you can go down
now, if you want.

14:24.959 --> 14:28.459
I'll be up at midnight.

14:28.459 --> 14:29.667
Yeah, she probably
just got a fright.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.626
Oh, poor, poor, poor girl.

14:31.626 --> 14:33.459
I've done a lot of sailing,

14:33.459 --> 14:35.375
but this is the first boat
that's bigger than 28 meters.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.709
Wow.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.292
Have you ever been
tempted to race her?

14:38.292 --> 14:40.792
We do regattas on
this boat.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.584
We actually have done
really well in regattas.

14:42.584 --> 14:44.375
-Fun racing.
-Yeah, exactly.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.876
We got surf and turf.

14:45.876 --> 14:48.667
Whoever don't like lobster,
we give only meat.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.876
Hey, girls, do you mind changing
into your blacks, please?

14:50.876 --> 14:52.959
-Okay, perfect.
-What time's dinner?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.542
8:30.

14:54.542 --> 14:55.792
Cool, but they have to
be finished by 9:00.

14:55.792 --> 14:57.334
That's part of the deal.

14:57.334 --> 14:58.667
Why?

14:58.667 --> 15:00.918
Why, because you're
eating with them?

15:00.918 --> 15:02.834
I'm missing out
on all the fun.

15:02.834 --> 15:04.542
-You wanna see magic?
-Yeah.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.501
Boom. Oo-eee!

15:06.501 --> 15:11.709
â™ª It's a kind of magic

15:11.709 --> 15:14.876
-You're gonna be on service.
-Okay.

15:14.876 --> 15:17.709
Wigs, yeah. Oh!

15:17.709 --> 15:20.292
So, I'll show you where
the placemats are.

15:20.292 --> 15:21.542
-You wanna help?
-Yeah.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.250
Blue cheese, dah, dah, dah.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.792
What wig are you gonna wear?

15:24.792 --> 15:26.667
-Do we get to wear wigs?
-Yeah.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.167
Put these on the
top or the left?

15:28.167 --> 15:29.751
On the top, in the middle.

15:29.751 --> 15:31.459
No, no, sorry... in the middle
of the placemat, so...

15:31.459 --> 15:33.667
I'll show you.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.292
Like this, and then
the cutlery...

15:36.292 --> 15:37.667
-Okay.
-...is gonna go at the side.

15:37.667 --> 15:38.667
Yeah, exactly.

15:38.667 --> 15:39.959
I'm freaking out.

15:39.959 --> 15:41.542
Like, I have never
done this before.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.209
I want all of these
firsts to be over with.

15:44.209 --> 15:46.209
Where do you want these knives?

15:46.209 --> 15:50.417
Starter knives are gonna
be the next one.

15:50.417 --> 15:54.834
Just please, Scarlett,
do it right.

15:54.834 --> 15:58.626
Soup, starter, and steak.

15:58.626 --> 16:00.250
So then we only
need two knives?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.250
Yeah.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.542
I love fire.

16:03.542 --> 16:04.667
Are you putting your
wig on, Evelyn?

16:04.667 --> 16:06.334
Yep, I'm doing it.

16:06.334 --> 16:10.751
Do you need help?
I can hold the front for you.

16:10.751 --> 16:11.876
Hey, guys.

16:11.876 --> 16:14.375
Oh sh--.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.334
Kinda look like
my grandma, though.

16:16.334 --> 16:18.209
Look at us.

16:18.209 --> 16:19.792
Oh, my God.

16:19.792 --> 16:20.959
What's up!

16:20.959 --> 16:23.334
You guys look so cute.

16:23.334 --> 16:24.918
Ashley, the master cabin
is free

16:24.918 --> 16:26.959
if you wanna do turn-down
in there, thank you.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.709
Great.

16:28.709 --> 16:30.167
Hopefully, we won't get
synthetic hair in our food.

16:30.167 --> 16:32.292
We'll be able to see it,
at least.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.792
Do you guys like my wig?

16:33.792 --> 16:35.209
-Yes!
-Cool, it looks so natural.

16:35.209 --> 16:37.292
Glenn, Daisy found this
wig for you.

16:37.292 --> 16:40.292
All right.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.459
I can't see,
where'd you guys go?

16:43.459 --> 16:45.792
Wow, that looks amazing.

16:45.792 --> 16:50.751
Tonight for dinner
I'm preparing duck breast.

16:50.751 --> 16:52.375
And I hope they like it,
you know?

16:52.375 --> 16:54.542
I'm just crossing
my fingers, please.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.375
It's gluten-free, primary, okay?

16:56.375 --> 16:58.918
Bailey and Jess
don't eat dairy.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.751
Keep it straight,
okay, guys, please.

17:01.751 --> 17:03.584
What have you been doing
since we saw you?

17:03.584 --> 17:07.876
Pretty much this.

17:07.876 --> 17:13.375
Oh, wait, no, I think I...

17:13.375 --> 17:21.167
This one here? Okay.

17:21.167 --> 17:24.501
Ugh... why?

17:24.501 --> 17:29.167
We have a seared duck breast
with a pear-Bordeaux reduction.

17:29.167 --> 17:30.584
In your case,
we put gluten-free.

17:30.584 --> 17:31.709
Thank you.

17:31.709 --> 17:32.959
And you and you,
no blue cheese.

17:32.959 --> 17:34.292
Oh, thank you.

17:34.292 --> 17:37.792
Enjoy!

17:37.792 --> 17:41.167
Are you doing it?
Are you eating it?

17:41.167 --> 17:42.209
Mm.

17:42.209 --> 17:43.834
I had some bites.

17:43.834 --> 17:44.959
Dude, I just ----ed up.

17:44.959 --> 17:46.459
Why?

17:46.459 --> 17:48.292
I, like, set the food
in the wrong place.

17:48.292 --> 17:50.375
It's not like you
dumped food on somebody.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.584
Thank you, I needed that.

17:51.584 --> 17:55.792
[laughing]

17:55.792 --> 17:56.876
Oh!

17:56.876 --> 17:59.876
I'm trying to put it all in.

17:59.876 --> 18:02.542
It actually doesn't taste
like I anticipated.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.751
I just feel terrible
eating a duck.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.501
-Scarlett, Daisy.
-[snoring]

18:06.501 --> 18:07.667
What did she say?

18:07.667 --> 18:09.834
She's calling you.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.209
[bleep]

18:11.209 --> 18:12.876
Medium-rare, medium,
medium-well.

18:12.876 --> 18:14.250
Do I look stressed?

18:14.250 --> 18:17.542
We can start clearing.

18:17.542 --> 18:18.959
All the other ones are the same?

18:18.959 --> 18:21.375
No, there's medium-well
done, which is Bailey.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.834
So, I'll do Bailey
and Glenn, yeah.

18:23.834 --> 18:24.959
That's Bailey.

18:24.959 --> 18:27.751
Medium-well, got it.

18:27.751 --> 18:30.876
Right now, we have a
beef tenderloin,

18:30.876 --> 18:32.667
center cut, with a
black pepper sauce.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.334
And then whoever have lobster,

18:34.334 --> 18:36.501
I just steamed the lobster,
and then I bake it.

18:36.501 --> 18:38.167
Thank you.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.959
Oh, I think my wig fell
off, oh, no.

18:40.959 --> 18:43.959
Should we just eat
with our nets on?

18:43.959 --> 18:45.292
Excuse me?

18:45.292 --> 18:46.792
-Our what?
-Just the hairnet.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.209
I thought you said
"eat with our nuts on."

18:49.209 --> 18:50.834
-Yeah.
-[laughing]

18:50.834 --> 18:53.501
I was like, I only think one
person at this table has nuts.

18:53.501 --> 18:55.542
[laughing]

18:55.542 --> 18:56.959
I think we're about
ready to clear.

18:56.959 --> 18:58.501
Thanks.

18:58.501 --> 18:59.584
Hey, Kels, you can go down,
if you want.

18:59.584 --> 19:02.375
That was excellent.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.000
[bleep] mate,
that looks amazing.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.542
[chattering]

19:06.542 --> 19:08.792
You better find some wind,
that's all I can say.

19:08.792 --> 19:13.751
A real sailor can make wind,
even when it's flat calm.

19:13.751 --> 19:14.959
Gary out there.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.792
Yeah, Gary... oh,
yeah, Gary, no...

19:17.792 --> 19:19.250
Gary can do everything.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.959
We need a bit more
than we had today.

19:20.959 --> 19:32.959
When you go to bed tonight,
make a wish for wind.

19:32.959 --> 19:34.626
-I'll be up at 8:00.
-Yeah.

19:34.626 --> 19:38.501
Okay.

19:38.501 --> 19:40.751
Right, get up prior.

19:40.751 --> 19:43.918
Ashley, you can come
with us to serve.

19:43.918 --> 19:45.584
Wow.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.459
All right, that's a gluten-free
chocolate cake,

19:47.459 --> 19:49.292
and then we have a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e,

19:49.292 --> 19:52.417
and then we have an Italian
meringue with a raspberry sauce.

19:52.417 --> 19:55.292
Oh, that is fresh strawberry.

19:55.292 --> 19:56.959
-That is good.
-Yeah. Yummy.

19:56.959 --> 19:58.417
A lot of different flavors.

19:58.417 --> 19:59.417
No, his food is...

19:59.417 --> 20:00.959
[chattering]

20:00.959 --> 20:03.667
Okay, and then he walked out
and was also amazing.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.375
It was a lot.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.459
Yeah, and I was like, "And the
food tastes better now."

20:06.459 --> 20:07.626
Feeling more confident now?

20:07.626 --> 20:09.375
Yeah, I feel better.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.918
Like, I'm not gonna lie,
I've got a little crush on you.

20:11.918 --> 20:14.459
Yeah.

20:14.459 --> 20:19.417
Maybe it's mutual,
maybe it shouldn't be.

20:19.417 --> 20:20.834
You get people that click,

20:20.834 --> 20:22.959
and then you get people
that don't click.

20:22.959 --> 20:24.417
Well, ladies, thank you
very, very much.

20:24.417 --> 20:25.459
Thank you.

20:25.459 --> 20:26.542
See you guys later, thank you.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.250
Bye, good night!

20:28.250 --> 20:30.417
Oh, my God, you look like
you should be milking a cow.

20:30.417 --> 20:32.584
[laughing]

20:32.584 --> 20:34.167
-All right, let's go.
-Oh!

20:34.167 --> 20:39.375
-All right, I'm yours.
-Okay.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.167
Okay.

20:41.167 --> 20:42.959
I'm gonna start taking
the decorations down upstairs.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.792
Okay.

20:44.792 --> 20:46.417
Gary likes everybody.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.876
You're good up here.

20:47.876 --> 20:49.626
Do you wanna just check
laundry before you go down?

20:49.626 --> 20:51.375
Yeah.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.918
I heard you told her that
I've got a crush on her.

20:53.918 --> 20:55.918
-Yeah.
-Yes.

20:55.918 --> 20:57.792
Good night.
Thank you.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.501
You did really good today.

20:59.501 --> 21:01.501
Maybe that's why I've got
a spring in my step.

21:01.501 --> 21:03.792
No sh--, Sherlock.

21:03.792 --> 21:05.792
In typical Gary fashion,

21:05.792 --> 21:07.667
Scarlett's the new girl
on the block,

21:07.667 --> 21:09.584
so he's trying out all
his best moves.

21:09.584 --> 21:11.459
He's pulling out all the stops.

21:11.459 --> 21:13.250
Oh, this guy...

21:13.250 --> 21:23.167
I just can't figure out how
his brain works.

21:23.167 --> 21:24.959
[laughing]

21:24.959 --> 21:28.375
[bleep] you.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.375
Yeah.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.918
[knocking]

21:32.918 --> 21:37.125
Yes?

21:37.125 --> 21:38.792
Come in.

21:38.792 --> 21:39.834
Yeah?

21:39.834 --> 21:44.125
-[knocking]
-[bleep]

21:44.125 --> 21:44.125
[laughing]

21:44.125 --> 21:58.584
Would anybody else like to go?

21:58.584 --> 22:01.542
[vocalizes]

22:01.542 --> 22:10.834
I'm so bored.

22:10.834 --> 22:19.834
I'm gonna go to bed.

22:19.834 --> 22:21.334
Yeah.

22:21.334 --> 22:22.542
Yeah, I know, I just said,
you know,

22:22.542 --> 22:25.334
10 courses, but oh sh--, yeah.

22:25.334 --> 22:28.334
-That's fine, we'll be fine.
-Yeah.

22:28.334 --> 22:29.876
-I'm not worried.
-Morning, Dais.

22:29.876 --> 22:30.876
-Morning.
-Morning, Marcos.

22:30.876 --> 22:32.167
Hey.

22:32.167 --> 22:33.751
Good morning.

22:33.751 --> 22:35.167
Mm.

22:35.167 --> 22:36.167
Look at you.

22:36.167 --> 22:50.501
I'm gonna add some milk.

22:50.501 --> 22:52.334
Thank you very much, Colin.

22:52.334 --> 22:53.375
All right.

22:53.375 --> 22:54.834
You guys ready?

22:54.834 --> 22:56.876
I'll show you how
to fold the towels.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.375
Do it with, like,
this little seamy thing,

22:59.375 --> 23:00.918
and then you're gonna
fold it down.

23:00.918 --> 23:02.876
-Can I get you a coffee?
-Yes.

23:02.876 --> 23:05.375
Let's do an iced black coffee.

23:05.375 --> 23:09.918
Yep.

23:09.918 --> 23:12.834
-Okay, there are guests awake.
-Thank you.

23:12.834 --> 23:14.667
[bleep] it's hot, eh?

23:14.667 --> 23:15.667
Yeah.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.250
Good, good, good.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.250
-There you go.
-Thank you very much, thank you.

23:18.250 --> 23:19.250
You're welcome.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.667
We're ready to eat.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.250
Okay, sure, I'll start
bringing everything up.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.501
I know you can crawl
under this table.

23:23.501 --> 23:24.792
We can totally fit.

23:24.792 --> 23:25.834
Oh, I could totally
get under it.

23:25.834 --> 23:26.834
Are we fitting?

23:26.834 --> 23:27.876
Gluten-free blueberry muffins?

23:27.876 --> 23:29.334
Yeah.

23:29.334 --> 23:30.834
There's no way
I can fit in that.

23:30.834 --> 23:31.876
-It's tight.
-Yes, there is.

23:31.876 --> 23:33.834
-Turn...
-Suck in and turn.

23:33.834 --> 23:35.334
Are you that drunk, that you're
crawling on the floor, that's...

23:35.334 --> 23:37.584
No, we just wanted to try it.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.584
They're just trying
to be dramatic.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.334
Oh, okay.

23:40.334 --> 23:41.792
I just wanted to figure out
what we're going to do

23:41.792 --> 23:44.584
after you guys have breakfast.

23:44.584 --> 23:46.751
Right now, there's no wind,
unfortunately,

23:46.751 --> 23:48.709
to go for a little sail,
but this afternoon,

23:48.709 --> 23:50.417
we could go in with the tender,

23:50.417 --> 23:52.959
in between the island
where that nice, blue water is,

23:52.959 --> 23:55.542
and you guys can play
around in there.

23:55.542 --> 23:56.876
-All right, thanks.
-Cool?

23:56.876 --> 23:57.959
Thank you.
Bon appÃ©tit.

23:57.959 --> 23:58.959
-Thank you.
-Thanks so much.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.375
Some bacon and hash browns.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.709
Do you wanna grab some...
eight goggles and snorkels?

24:03.709 --> 24:04.959
I don't know if we've got
that many.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.542
So much stuff.

24:06.542 --> 24:07.876
I'm like, I don't know
where to start.

24:07.876 --> 24:09.834
Do you want some hash browns?

24:09.834 --> 24:11.542
Do you want ones that connect?

24:11.542 --> 24:12.918
Four.

24:12.918 --> 24:15.209
No, no... this one
is a good one.

24:15.209 --> 24:17.626
What did you do, just pick them
all up and throw them in here?

24:17.626 --> 24:18.918
I wanna do some water things.

24:18.918 --> 24:20.375
Yeah.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.918
-Should we get bathing suits on?
-Yeah.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.751
How's the 10 courses going?

24:24.751 --> 24:26.792
I got the desserts,
I got the first one.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.501
People wants a 10-course meal

24:28.501 --> 24:31.459
because they wanna see
how many quality cuisines

24:31.459 --> 24:33.501
you can present
on one night.

24:33.501 --> 24:35.584
I want them to have
the same experience

24:35.584 --> 24:37.334
with all their restrictions.

24:37.334 --> 24:38.792
It's gonna be hard to do it,

24:38.792 --> 24:40.375
but it's not gonna
be impossible.

24:40.375 --> 24:44.542
Rib-eye, lemon sorbet,
matcha tiramisu, sh--.

24:44.542 --> 24:47.834
Six, that's seven.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.834
How old do I look?

24:49.834 --> 24:51.667
Honestly, I would have
put you in your twenties.

24:51.667 --> 24:53.417
I would have said
at least, like, 34.

24:53.417 --> 24:55.417
Wow, you had to give me
that ----ing high?

24:55.417 --> 24:56.834
-Wait, aren't you 34?
-Yeah.

24:56.834 --> 24:58.792
Oh, yeah.

24:58.792 --> 24:59.876
I feel like you look your age.

24:59.876 --> 25:01.626
That's not good!

25:01.626 --> 25:05.375
Are we wanting to swim,
or... yeah, okay.

25:05.375 --> 25:06.375
-If we can go now, then...
-Yeah?

25:06.375 --> 25:07.834
...we would love to.

25:07.834 --> 25:08.834
Awesome, all right,
I'll let the boys know.

25:08.834 --> 25:11.250
Okay.

25:11.250 --> 25:14.542
Jess is saying they wanna go
swimming as soon as they can.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.375
Can you go by yourself?

25:16.375 --> 25:17.792
No, I'll take Scarlett with me.

25:17.792 --> 25:19.626
Can you not be by yourself here?

25:19.626 --> 25:22.959
No, I can, I just...
yeah, fine.

25:22.959 --> 25:25.626
So, we're gonna go on a
tender cruise for the guests.

25:25.626 --> 25:29.501
You're gonna come with so
you can give them drinks.

25:29.501 --> 25:31.667
I have Gary so figured out.

25:31.667 --> 25:33.375
He is so transparent.

25:33.375 --> 25:36.834
I don't want Scarlett going off
on a little tender run,

25:36.834 --> 25:39.167
chatting and flirting
with Gary for an hour.

25:39.167 --> 25:46.375
I mean, this sh--'s
so predictable.

25:46.375 --> 25:47.959
-Morning, shaggers.
-How's it?

25:47.959 --> 25:51.501
Gary, do you really need
a stew for drinks?

25:51.501 --> 25:53.792
I would rather not send a stew,
but if you need someone,

25:53.792 --> 25:54.959
I mean, it's literally
mimosas and water.

25:54.959 --> 25:56.959
Well, he's gotta do stuff here.

25:56.959 --> 25:58.709
He's gotta pack this away,
and he's gotta do the waterline,

25:58.709 --> 26:00.709
and Kelsie's going down now.

26:00.709 --> 26:01.792
Basically they're
gonna be ----ing around

26:01.792 --> 26:03.667
hanging out in the boat.

26:03.667 --> 26:05.584
I just think it looks more
professional when I'm driving,

26:05.584 --> 26:06.959
so I don't have to
give them drinks also.

26:06.959 --> 26:08.375
But if you don't
want it, that's fine.

26:08.375 --> 26:11.584
I can do it by myself.

26:11.584 --> 26:14.959
Do you get what I'm saying?

26:14.959 --> 26:18.417
You've got one reason to be
here, and it's to ----ing work.

26:18.417 --> 26:20.334
I'm not gonna argue with you.

26:20.334 --> 26:21.751
I just think it's more
professional having two people

26:21.751 --> 26:22.792
-for the guests.
-Okay, then I'll send someone.

26:22.792 --> 26:27.626
Okay. We need some towels.

26:27.626 --> 26:30.417
What do we want
to bring for drinks?

26:30.417 --> 26:32.459
I'll probably stick with
the pineapple mimosas.

26:32.459 --> 26:33.459
Yeah.

26:33.459 --> 26:40.292
So, is a stew coming or not?

26:40.292 --> 26:41.709
Sounds good.

26:41.709 --> 26:44.167
If all the guests are off,
what are three girls

26:44.167 --> 26:46.709
going to be doing on the boat,
not ----ing around?

26:46.709 --> 26:49.667
Yes, you can't win with
that chick, bro, swear to God.

26:49.667 --> 26:51.584
-Yes.
-It's a joke.

26:51.584 --> 26:54.042
So over working with her,
I'm not gonna lie.

26:54.042 --> 26:56.292
Gary wants someone because
it looks more professional,

26:56.292 --> 26:58.042
and I'm like, that's literally
a stew ----ing around

26:58.042 --> 27:00.459
-in a boat for an hour.
-Yeah.

27:00.459 --> 27:02.334
When they could be
here laundering

27:02.334 --> 27:03.792
or vacuuming or anything.

27:03.792 --> 27:06.459
So, I'm gonna go,
to prove a point.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.250
Daisy, Gary.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.709
We are ready to rock and roll,

27:09.709 --> 27:11.334
if you wanna let
the guests know.

27:11.334 --> 27:13.626
Copy, thank you.

27:13.626 --> 27:16.542
Ladies, we are ready for you.

27:16.542 --> 27:24.918
Yes.

27:24.918 --> 27:27.417
I... what the...
are you being serious?

27:27.417 --> 27:29.334
Dead serious, yeah. It's like...

27:29.334 --> 27:30.918
-How am I starting a fight?
-...there's no guests on board.

27:30.918 --> 27:32.876
There's guests
in the tender, Daisy.

27:32.876 --> 27:35.542
We're here for the guests.

27:35.542 --> 27:42.667
You ladies ready to go?

27:42.667 --> 27:44.584
Are you ----ing kidding me?

27:44.584 --> 27:46.626
You're such a ----ing asshole.

27:46.626 --> 27:47.834
What the [bleep]?

27:47.834 --> 27:50.250
Don't you dare accuse me

27:50.250 --> 27:51.667
of not caring about the guests

27:51.667 --> 27:52.918
or putting the guests forward.

27:52.918 --> 27:54.667
It's ridiculous.

27:54.667 --> 27:57.375
----ing lecture me on what
I'm ----ing here for.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.751
-No, you're ----ing...
-Yeah, I am ----ing coming.

27:58.751 --> 28:07.626
Are you insane? Asshole.

28:07.626 --> 28:10.959
-No, you're ----ing...
-Yeah, I am ----ing coming.

28:10.959 --> 28:12.959
Are you insane? Asshole.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.959
-Ow... [bleep] me.
-Calm down,

28:14.959 --> 28:18.000
It's not ----ing funny, Gary,
you're a ----ing right ----ed.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.501
I'm not really upset that
he wants a stew to go.

28:20.501 --> 28:24.375
I'm not happy because
of the accusatory tone

28:24.375 --> 28:27.959
that Gary is using towards
me that I am unprofessional

28:27.959 --> 28:31.542
and that I don't care
about the guests.

28:31.542 --> 28:32.584
Unbelievable.

28:32.584 --> 28:34.375
What would you like?

28:34.375 --> 28:39.709
Oh, Gary's got it, it's fine.

28:39.709 --> 28:41.083
Do you want one of
those things that

28:41.083 --> 28:52.834
suction-cups you to the hull?

28:52.834 --> 28:57.375
It's hot now, though.

28:57.375 --> 28:59.501
-Did you see any fish?
-Yeah.

28:59.501 --> 29:00.584
You did?

29:00.584 --> 29:02.417
You should catch them for lunch.

29:02.417 --> 29:10.959
[laughing]

29:10.959 --> 29:12.959
Oh, I'm ----ing tired already.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.626
I think it's just a little
hard sometimes, because,

29:14.626 --> 29:16.375
like, I have to exert
more energy

29:16.375 --> 29:20.125
telling her how to do things
and what to do.

29:20.125 --> 29:25.709
Okay.

29:25.709 --> 29:28.959
Whew.

29:28.959 --> 29:31.751
Would you like another drink?

29:31.751 --> 29:35.667
What the [bleep]
am I doing here?

29:35.667 --> 29:37.959
Come on, that's just
----ing ridiculous.

29:37.959 --> 29:39.584
Parsifal, Parsifal, Parsifal,

29:39.584 --> 29:41.501
we are on our way back
with the guests.

29:41.501 --> 29:48.918
Yeah, copy that, we're waiting
for you on the swim platform.

29:48.918 --> 29:50.375
Ah!

29:50.375 --> 29:51.918
-Thank you.
-How was that?

29:51.918 --> 29:53.417
Lovely.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.751
I just wanna tuck it
in like that.

29:55.751 --> 29:56.751
Yeah, just like that.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.459
[bleep] me.

29:58.459 --> 30:02.417
Hey, girls, do you mind changing
into your blacks, please?

30:02.417 --> 30:04.083
Are you getting ready
for dinner now?

30:04.083 --> 30:05.292
Yeah.

30:05.292 --> 30:06.501
Gary, do you know this boat?

30:06.501 --> 30:08.626
-La Cattiva.
-I know the captain.

30:08.626 --> 30:10.375
The guy is there,
he just bought her.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.459
Maybe we should do a
little race or something.

30:12.459 --> 30:14.918
-Us against them?
-Yeah, friendly competition.

30:14.918 --> 30:16.459
That sounds awesome.

30:16.459 --> 30:18.250
All we need is a
few hours' of sea breeze.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.250
Yeah, and if the wind picks up
I think they would like it also,

30:20.250 --> 30:21.584
because they wanna
go sailing.

30:21.584 --> 30:23.000
Yeah, exactly.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.792
We don't normally do,
like, a match race,

30:24.792 --> 30:26.918
but being that we haven't
been able to sail yet,

30:26.918 --> 30:29.375
if the wind changes,
having a little match race

30:29.375 --> 30:31.876
is gonna make it all
that much more special.

30:31.876 --> 30:33.501
We'll just say
there's an imaginary mark

30:33.501 --> 30:34.959
out there somewhere?

30:34.959 --> 30:36.501
Yeah, we'll put a mark
or whatever, you know.

30:36.501 --> 30:37.918
Mm-hmm.

30:37.918 --> 30:39.751
I've done a lot of
races on Parsifal,

30:39.751 --> 30:41.292
five St. Barths buckets,

30:41.292 --> 30:44.375
two or three Virgin Gorda
super yachts.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.626
It does pretty well on
the race course,

30:46.626 --> 30:48.667
so why not have a little fun?

30:48.667 --> 30:50.751
I'll let you know if anything...
if it goes forward.

30:50.751 --> 30:59.417
Yes, that'd be awesome.

30:59.417 --> 31:00.834
Gary, he's been, like,

31:00.834 --> 31:02.959
coming on to me
really strong lately.

31:02.959 --> 31:03.959
That's how... yeah.

31:03.959 --> 31:07.792
Does that bother you?

31:07.792 --> 31:15.792
-Yeah.
-Meh.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.042
First of all, I didn't wanna,
like, step on your toes,

31:18.042 --> 31:20.042
so I'm glad that you
just don't give a sh--.

31:20.042 --> 31:21.751
What do you want me to say?

31:21.751 --> 31:23.667
Yes, you have my permission
to hook up with a guy

31:23.667 --> 31:24.834
that's gonna treat you
like sh--.

31:24.834 --> 31:26.042
Go for it?

31:26.042 --> 31:30.584
Do you think Daisy cares?

31:30.584 --> 31:35.751
Yeah. So...

31:35.751 --> 31:37.959
Gazpacho's ready,
beet salad, boom.

31:37.959 --> 31:40.626
Pasta, Dover sole, steamed.

31:40.626 --> 31:42.792
Sauces ready, veggies ready.

31:42.792 --> 31:44.584
Salmon, beef tenderloin,

31:44.584 --> 31:47.751
rib-eye, lemon sorbet,
and matcha tiramisu.

31:47.751 --> 31:51.375
Everyone has to help tonight,
there's 80 plates.

31:51.375 --> 32:08.792
Sweet.

32:08.792 --> 32:09.959
That's all right.

32:09.959 --> 32:11.417
Yeah, should we look at
the sunset?

32:11.417 --> 32:12.667
Let's go this side, come on.

32:12.667 --> 32:15.834
I think Gary and
Scarlett are outside.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.459
Wait, I need to make sure
that I'm not needed.

32:17.459 --> 32:19.083
Oh, really?

32:19.083 --> 32:20.792
Actually, you are, because
I'm gonna distracting you,

32:20.792 --> 32:22.375
and then Daisy's gonna get
even more angry with me.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.459
-Where's Scarlett?
-Talking to Gary.

32:24.459 --> 32:26.375
-Oh, it's so pretty, yeah.
-Oh, this is so pretty.

32:26.375 --> 32:30.542
The sunset's not
too bad either.

32:30.542 --> 32:32.584
Scarlett, do you mind
checking laundry, please?

32:32.584 --> 32:33.751
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

32:33.751 --> 32:34.751
Yeah... look, you see?
Told you.

32:34.751 --> 32:36.417
-Yeah.
-Told you.

32:36.417 --> 32:37.959
He needs to stay the [bleep]
out of my department,

32:37.959 --> 32:39.709
and I'm ----ing sick of it.

32:39.709 --> 32:41.542
I look so much better.

32:41.542 --> 32:45.626
Is that good?

32:45.626 --> 32:48.292
The master might be free.

32:48.292 --> 32:51.250
Okay, my suitcases are going
to fall down, I'm sorry.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.918
Ladies, would you like
anything to drink?

32:52.918 --> 32:54.959
Can I just do a red wine?

32:54.959 --> 32:57.959
Holy moly,
that's a lot of plates.

32:57.959 --> 32:59.584
Mm-mm.

32:59.584 --> 33:00.584
Just so you know,
I wasn't mad at you.

33:00.584 --> 33:02.959
I'm fuming at Gary.

33:02.959 --> 33:05.584
All day, he ----ing banged on
at me about my department

33:05.584 --> 33:07.584
and about how
unprofessional I am.

33:07.584 --> 33:10.542
Daisy this and Daisy that, yeah,
because you're a ----ing baby.

33:10.542 --> 33:12.918
Oh, poor Gary, ooh.

33:12.918 --> 33:16.083
All Gary does
all day is cause trouble.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.751
You don't do that to two stews.

33:18.751 --> 33:20.792
You don't [bleep] one
and then go

33:20.792 --> 33:22.501
and try and [bleep]
her roommate.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.542
What the hell is this?

33:24.542 --> 33:27.000
One you've already ----ed who's
kissed you, like, five times,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.918
and now you're already
pursuing the next stew,

33:29.918 --> 33:32.834
and I'm the ----ing
unprofessional one?

33:32.834 --> 33:36.375
You're an asshole!

33:36.375 --> 33:38.375
Where did this come from?

33:38.375 --> 33:39.834
Daisy, Daisy, Ashley.

33:39.834 --> 33:41.375
I'm just, like,
if you're not interested,

33:41.375 --> 33:42.417
why did you sleep with her?

33:42.417 --> 33:43.918
Yeah.

33:43.918 --> 33:45.626
-Yeah, go ahead.
-T
hey're all seated.

33:45.626 --> 33:47.292
Okay, sorry, I've gotta go.

33:47.292 --> 33:48.751
-Okay. Thanks, Daisy...
-Copy. You're welcome.

33:48.751 --> 33:50.417
...for coming and
talking about it.

33:50.417 --> 33:51.584
There's gonna be a lot
of plates to wash tonight,

33:51.584 --> 33:53.459
I'm not gonna lie.

33:53.459 --> 34:00.792
I feel like it's gonna be,
like, speed dish-washing.

34:00.792 --> 34:02.709
-How are you, girls?
-Good. Hello.

34:02.709 --> 34:04.542
We have gazpacho Andaluz,

34:04.542 --> 34:08.334
with crispy prosciutto
and quail egg on top.

34:08.334 --> 34:09.584
Gracias.

34:09.584 --> 34:11.417
The crispy prosciutto
is really good.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.417
So scared to eat a quail egg.

34:13.417 --> 34:14.584
It tastes like quail.

34:14.584 --> 34:15.959
No, it doesn't!

34:15.959 --> 34:17.584
This is number two.

34:17.584 --> 34:18.584
If you need stuff, I can help,

34:18.584 --> 34:19.792
I can take stuff
out for you, eh?

34:19.792 --> 34:21.375
Tea towels.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.459
I got 'em,
chuck 'em right there.

34:22.459 --> 34:23.792
Thank you.

34:23.792 --> 34:26.834
-What is that, beetroot?
-Beetroot and mango.

34:26.834 --> 34:28.501
That looks beautiful.

34:28.501 --> 34:32.542
Daisy, I just cleared
the first course.

34:32.542 --> 34:35.375
Beetroot tartare with mango,

34:35.375 --> 34:36.918
caramelized hazelnut,

34:36.918 --> 34:38.959
goat cheese foam,
and balsamic reduction.

34:38.959 --> 34:40.375
Sounds delicious.

34:40.375 --> 34:41.834
Thank you, this is
right up my alley.

34:41.834 --> 34:43.709
Oh, my gosh, it's
the best dinner ever.

34:43.709 --> 34:45.542
Oh, yeah.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.918
Uno, dos...

34:47.918 --> 34:49.584
Yeah, I need six forks
and five knives.

34:49.584 --> 34:50.667
-We need the forks?
-I need forks, yeah.

34:50.667 --> 34:51.751
Okay.

34:51.751 --> 34:53.000
No cutlery.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.792
One, I'm not gonna put cheese.

34:54.792 --> 34:55.959
Okay.

34:55.959 --> 34:57.501
All right, number three,
coming up.

34:57.501 --> 35:00.584
Three on the left.

35:00.584 --> 35:03.375
So, we have a penne rigate
with cherry tomatoes,

35:03.375 --> 35:05.042
white wine, no cheese.

35:05.042 --> 35:08.792
Okay. No stomach ache tonight.

35:08.792 --> 35:10.959
Every time he comes up,
she's like,

35:10.959 --> 35:15.584
"Oh, muy caliente,
muchos gracias."

35:15.584 --> 35:16.751
This is all clean, correct?

35:16.751 --> 35:18.042
Yep.

35:18.042 --> 35:19.751
Kelsie, can we get
the big forks washed?

35:19.751 --> 35:21.584
Can you pass me that
little flower?

35:21.584 --> 35:23.542
He definitely knows that
you think he's hot,

35:23.542 --> 35:27.959
because you turn into a little
Latin lover when he comes out.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.751
All right, vamos.

35:29.751 --> 35:31.584
-We have Dover sole.
-Braided.

35:31.584 --> 35:32.959
-Yeah, a braid... enjoy, guys.
-Thank you.

35:32.959 --> 35:34.792
This is a baby cucumber.

35:34.792 --> 35:36.459
-No, it's a zucchini.
-No, zucchini, eat it.

35:36.459 --> 35:39.459
I can't eat it with
everybody looking at me.

35:39.459 --> 35:42.584
It has a good flavor.

35:42.584 --> 35:44.667
[bleep], I'm sweating
like an animal.

35:44.667 --> 35:47.751
I'm ready.

35:47.751 --> 35:50.584
You like to speak Spanish,
though, when he comes out.

35:50.584 --> 35:52.584
I don't know.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.334
Muy caliente.

35:54.334 --> 35:57.042
So, we have a seared salmon.

35:57.042 --> 35:58.959
We have some chipotle
aioli on the side.

35:58.959 --> 36:00.959
-So, enjoy it.
-Thank you.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.792
She's gonna ask him to
take his shirt off.

36:02.792 --> 36:05.459
Okay, there's those.

36:05.459 --> 36:08.834
We're clearing, Marcos.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.542
All right.

36:11.542 --> 36:14.626
So, we have a beef tenderloin
marinated with fresh herbs.

36:14.626 --> 36:20.918
It's so good.

36:20.918 --> 36:22.417
I'm lying... maybe I do.

36:22.417 --> 36:24.584
I think it's a
unanimous wondering...

36:24.584 --> 36:28.959
I'm wondering now, too.

36:28.959 --> 36:30.792
Oh, muchas gracias.

36:30.792 --> 36:32.751
It's a simple
green bean tempura.

36:32.751 --> 36:33.792
Three more to go.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.459
I hope they're all desserts.

36:35.459 --> 36:37.584
The last two are desserts, yeah.

36:37.584 --> 36:39.959
Good.

36:39.959 --> 36:41.417
Hey, how are you doing?

36:41.417 --> 36:42.542
Pretty much done.

36:42.542 --> 36:44.626
Don't forget about this head.

36:44.626 --> 36:46.083
And this needs another water.

36:46.083 --> 36:48.000
Okay.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.459
Sorry, I'm gonna just keep
telling you what you're missing.

36:49.459 --> 36:50.751
No, yeah.

36:50.751 --> 36:52.042
You're missing a
white facecloth here.

36:52.042 --> 36:55.584
-Okay.
-But it's looking good.

36:55.584 --> 36:57.584
-I think I'm ready.
-Okay.

36:57.584 --> 37:00.417
Okay.

37:00.417 --> 37:05.709
Oh, my God, I'm so exhausted.

37:05.709 --> 37:08.417
We have a Wagyu rib-eye.

37:08.417 --> 37:10.626
Oh!

37:10.626 --> 37:12.792
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

37:12.792 --> 37:14.584
Can I use your hat?

37:14.584 --> 37:16.000
He wants to take a piece of
your clothing and fan himself.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.751
Oh, my God, probably
they imagine me

37:18.751 --> 37:20.918
with the apron, no shirt.

37:20.918 --> 37:23.834
I'm here to fill any
chef fantasy they have.

37:23.834 --> 37:26.375
Thank God that I know how
to please a picky woman,

37:26.375 --> 37:31.375
you know... eesh.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.626
[laughing]

37:33.626 --> 37:35.375
Coming up...

37:35.375 --> 37:37.042
We're gonna be racing with this
boat here behind us.

37:37.042 --> 37:39.959
Let's get this
thing cranked over.

37:39.959 --> 37:42.584
[honking]

37:42.584 --> 37:48.167
You will lose.

37:48.167 --> 37:50.501
Es muy caliente.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.959
You guys, we need to ask him
to be in the hot tub later.

37:53.959 --> 37:56.000
-No way!
-No!

37:56.000 --> 37:57.167
No?

37:57.167 --> 38:00.792
-Ah!
-Oh, my God.

38:00.792 --> 38:02.042
I got it.

38:02.042 --> 38:03.125
-Do you want this in?
-Leak.

38:03.125 --> 38:04.584
Okay. I'm heading out.

38:04.584 --> 38:05.834
Ooh!

38:05.834 --> 38:08.959
Lemon sorbet, lemon zest
on top, and mint.

38:08.959 --> 38:10.792
That's gonna clean your
palates before...

38:10.792 --> 38:12.542
Jacuzzi?

38:12.542 --> 38:15.542
Postre en Jacuzzi, no?

38:15.542 --> 38:17.709
"Dessert in Jacuzzi?"

38:17.709 --> 38:19.626
Postre en Jacuzzi...
I got that.

38:19.626 --> 38:21.626
[laughing]

38:21.626 --> 38:29.167
Yeow, okay.

38:29.167 --> 38:33.709
Yeah, I'm gonna wipe
all the wood, yeah.

38:33.709 --> 38:34.918
Are we all finished?

38:34.918 --> 38:38.125
Yeah.

38:38.125 --> 38:39.792
[sighs]

38:39.792 --> 38:42.584
-All right, it's over.
-Good job, Marcos.

38:42.584 --> 38:43.709
-Yeah, good job.
-Is that dessert?

38:43.709 --> 38:46.959
-Yes.
-Yeah, the last one.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.834
That looks good.

38:48.834 --> 38:52.167
This is a matcha tiramisu with
the gold strawberry on top.

38:52.167 --> 38:54.792
Anybody who doesn't finish
yours, just give it to me.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.667
All right, ladies,
buenas noches.

38:56.667 --> 38:57.959
Everything's wonderful.

38:57.959 --> 39:02.626
Okay.

39:02.626 --> 39:03.918
I worked a lot sh--.

39:03.918 --> 39:05.125
Yeah, no, that was
amazing, honestly.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.959
Time to lay on
the ----ing couch.

39:07.959 --> 39:10.000
I'm actually disappointed
now that this is gone.

39:10.000 --> 39:10.959
Do you want mine, too?

39:10.959 --> 39:12.959
Well, yeah.

39:12.959 --> 39:16.792
Ah...

39:16.792 --> 39:18.709
Daisy, I'm really sorry for
picking a fight with you.

39:18.709 --> 39:20.167
I shouldn't have.

39:20.167 --> 39:22.959
It was pretty petty, and
it was petty from my part.

39:22.959 --> 39:24.459
Not from yours, you had reason.

39:24.459 --> 39:25.792
Okay.

39:25.792 --> 39:26.834
And you had reason to
be pissed with me.

39:26.834 --> 39:27.918
This is freaking me out.

39:27.918 --> 39:29.042
What, I'm saying sorry to you.

39:29.042 --> 39:30.542
I appreciate you...

39:30.542 --> 39:31.834
Just stop it,
I'm saying sorry!

39:31.834 --> 39:33.584
I appreciate your apology,
thank you.

39:33.584 --> 39:35.167
Thank you.

39:35.167 --> 39:37.417
I get the vibe from
Daisy sometimes

39:37.417 --> 39:39.667
that she has a thing for Gary.

39:39.667 --> 39:42.000
Daisy is my boss,
and it's just...

39:42.000 --> 39:43.918
it's a weird dynamic for me.

39:43.918 --> 39:45.000
Okay, friends again,
besties.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.709
Yes, thanks for the apology.

39:46.709 --> 39:49.584
You're welcome, sorry
for being such a dick.

39:49.584 --> 39:50.876
All right, guys,
we're going to hit the hay.

39:50.876 --> 39:53.125
Good night.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.459
Good night, Scarlett,
see you in the morning.

39:55.459 --> 39:56.959
Not much for you.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.626
Still wanna get the windlass
area, around there.

39:58.626 --> 39:59.876
Yeah. Good night, mate.

39:59.876 --> 40:01.167
Night, I'll see you
in the morning.

40:01.167 --> 40:02.542
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

40:02.542 --> 40:16.459
-Good night.
-Good night.

40:16.459 --> 40:17.959
-Good morning, how are you?
-How are you?

40:17.959 --> 40:23.834
Good, thank you.

40:23.834 --> 40:26.375
Morning, ladies.
Do you want coffees?

40:26.375 --> 40:27.959
I have never wanted
something more.

40:27.959 --> 40:31.000
Okay.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.125
So, what's the deal
with this current?

40:32.125 --> 40:33.626
I don't know.

40:33.626 --> 40:36.751
Oh sh--, there's
some wind around here.

40:36.751 --> 40:37.959
Hopefully.

40:37.959 --> 40:39.959
[phone ringing]

40:39.959 --> 40:41.584
Andy, it's Glenn from Parsifal.

40:41.584 --> 40:43.667
Listen, I got
a question for you.

40:43.667 --> 40:46.959
We haven't been able to do any
sailing so far this charter.

40:46.959 --> 40:49.000
There's a little bit
of wind forecast,

40:49.000 --> 40:50.834
and I'm wondering if you guys

40:50.834 --> 40:53.000
maybe wanna do,
like, a fun race.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.459
Really? Excellent, perfect.
Thank you very much, man.

40:56.459 --> 40:58.125
Talk to you later.
Thanks, bye.

40:58.125 --> 40:59.501
Well, if this one stays up,
it'll be quite a nice sail

40:59.501 --> 41:00.959
I know, I thought
the same thing.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.959
Good morning, we're gonna
get ready to go sailing.

41:02.959 --> 41:04.959
It's on!

41:04.959 --> 41:08.542
We've kind of organized a race
with this boat here behind us.

41:08.542 --> 41:10.501
-Wow!
-Yes!

41:10.501 --> 41:11.667
So, we're not just gonna be
sailing, we're gonna be racing.

41:11.667 --> 41:13.417
Yes!

41:13.417 --> 41:15.125
Nobody's more
competitive than me.

41:15.125 --> 41:16.125
Let's get this going.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.501
This is intense.

41:17.501 --> 41:19.751
I can skip breakfast for this.

41:19.751 --> 41:20.834
Yeah, I'm easy like that.

41:20.834 --> 41:23.834
Okay, great.

41:23.834 --> 41:25.959
Marcos, we're not
doing breakfast today.

41:25.959 --> 41:29.584
Okay.

41:29.584 --> 41:30.876
[sighs]

41:30.876 --> 41:32.792
So, this is the plan...

41:32.792 --> 41:36.459
this boat, La Cattiva, they've
agreed to do a little race.

41:36.459 --> 41:39.834
We'll do a start here,
around, first mark out here,

41:39.834 --> 41:41.042
and finish up back here.

41:41.042 --> 41:42.042
I wanna win.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.667
So, we should go up.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.501
It's so fun,
we're gonna race a boat.

41:45.501 --> 41:46.792
All crew, all crew,
the other boat, La Cattiva,

41:46.792 --> 41:54.918
is gonna be here
in about 15 minutes.

41:54.918 --> 41:56.501
Colin, Colin, Glenn.

41:56.501 --> 41:58.959
You can start picking up,
I'll come ahead.

41:58.959 --> 42:02.542
Whenever we heel and we go
sailing, something breaks.

42:02.542 --> 42:04.876
Anchor's home, anchor's home.

42:04.876 --> 42:10.667
Bloody Marys.

42:10.667 --> 42:12.918
Cattiva, Cattiva, you
guys will hear a horn.

42:12.918 --> 42:14.709
When the horn starts,

42:14.709 --> 42:16.959
that's when we'll unfurl
the genoa and start racing.

42:16.959 --> 42:17.959
Let's do this,
time for a little competition.

42:17.959 --> 42:18.959
Let's do this!

42:18.959 --> 42:20.501
Okay, let's start unfurling.

42:20.501 --> 42:21.876
Okay, going up.

42:21.876 --> 42:24.000
-You wanna watch the mizzen?
-Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.792
I may not be a seasoned
hard yachtie,

42:25.792 --> 42:27.959
but I've raced
a million race boats.

42:27.959 --> 42:29.667
Hold.

42:29.667 --> 42:30.751
Okay, that's good,
let's go to the main.

42:30.751 --> 42:32.667
This is what I'm here for,

42:32.667 --> 42:34.876
not this toodling around
on night shift.

42:34.876 --> 42:37.167
Let's get this
thing cranked over.

42:37.167 --> 42:39.459
Okay, hold.

42:39.459 --> 42:40.876
[horn sounds]

42:40.876 --> 42:42.626
Is that the horn to start?

42:42.626 --> 42:46.375
Okay, coming out on the genoa.

42:46.375 --> 42:49.042
Take a picture of
the competition.

42:49.042 --> 42:50.667
You happy with that genoa?

42:50.667 --> 42:53.459
Yeah, it looked good.

42:53.459 --> 42:55.000
Nothing like a friendly race.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.083
I know.

42:56.083 --> 42:58.000
No such thing as a friendly.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
You will lose.
