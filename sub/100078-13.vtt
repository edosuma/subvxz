WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:07.299
You have to work out whatever feelings
you're having about Dr. Marcel.

00:08.134 --> 00:09.301
Fast.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.347
Get me a Narcan inhaler.

00:14.807 --> 00:15.850
(GASPS)

00:15.933 --> 00:18.310
You overdosed.
But you're gonna be all right.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.063
You let this get way too personal, Will.
Never a good idea.

00:21.147 --> 00:22.773
For God's sakes, isn't it personal?

00:22.857 --> 00:24.442
You lost a brother to drugs.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.735
Enough!

00:28.154 --> 00:29.238
I met you this morning.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.490
-I'm gonna try to turn things around.
-Good.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.539
Hey.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.958
(CHUCKLES) Hi.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.677
-I love you.
-(GASPS)

00:51.761 --> 00:52.803
-Easy.
-Oh, God.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.180
-Sorry.
-Only me.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.723
I wasn't expecting that.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.601
Hey, I know work's not the place
for ambush affection,

00:58.684 --> 00:59.769
but I couldn't help myself.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.562
I won't hold it against you.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.481
-(CHUCKLES)
-What's up?

01:03.564 --> 01:04.940
I haven't seen a smile this big

01:05.024 --> 01:07.234
-since Navy beat Army.
-(LAUGHS)

01:07.860 --> 01:09.570
Just thinking about being a dad.

01:10.488 --> 01:13.199
Birthday parties, coaching teams.

01:13.282 --> 01:16.744
That's a decade down the road.
We are three weeks into IVF.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.497
You know what they say,
you blink and the kids are grown.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.918
-Hey.
-What up?

01:24.001 --> 01:25.544
Pelicans covered the spread.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.380
How many rings do the Pelicans have?

01:28.464 --> 01:29.548
-(LAUGHS)
-Go Bulls.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.091
Yeah, we'll see.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.724
I'm a horrible person, aren't I?

01:38.808 --> 01:40.976
No, you're human.

01:41.811 --> 01:42.895
What can I do to help?

01:42.978 --> 01:44.897
You got a time machine?

01:48.734 --> 01:49.985
-Hey, you.
-NATALIE: Hey.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.695
Date last night, spill it.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.198
It was nice. He was polite,

01:54.281 --> 01:57.368
handsome, smart, but... I don't think so.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.454
Oh. Well, polite, smart
and handsome. Sounds awful.

02:00.538 --> 02:03.624
All right, the real reason,
he's a psych professor.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.251
The way he looked at me,

02:05.334 --> 02:07.211
I just couldn't shake the feeling
that I was being analyzed.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.047
This is the fourth first date
without even considering a second.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.924
NATALIE: Well, I'm glad
you're counting, Mom.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.175
-(MAGGIE GRUNTS)
-Look, it doesn't matter,

02:13.259 --> 02:14.885
because none of those guys
were gonna work out anyways.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.389
Wow. ESP.

02:19.056 --> 02:22.726
Say, do you know when the Saints
are gonna win another Super Bowl?

02:24.144 --> 02:27.606
All right, well, let me know
if you get another vision.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.444
All I'm saying is the right
second date is out there,

02:32.528 --> 02:34.154
and I'll know it when I meet him.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.574
WOMAN: Help! Please, my son!

02:36.657 --> 02:37.700
-APRIL: Oh, my...
-NOAH: I got him.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.160
-Where am I going?
-Trauma One.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.287
WOMAN: Help my husband and son!

02:41.370 --> 02:43.205
MAN: Help! Help, help, help, help!

02:46.792 --> 02:49.253
Help him, I... I didn't know what to do.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.340
(DYLAN SCREAMING)

02:58.304 --> 03:00.514
Okay, bruising on his neck.
Protect it and bag him.

03:00.598 --> 03:02.600
Hold C-spine. What's his name?

03:02.683 --> 03:03.976
Jamie.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.896
Jamie. Hey, Jamie.
Can you hear me?

03:06.979 --> 03:10.733
Okay, okay. Take it easy.
You're okay. Take it easy.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.818
-What happened?
-MAN: It was an accident.

03:13.736 --> 03:14.778
I choked him out.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.824
I had to.

03:33.631 --> 03:36.258
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

03:36.342 --> 03:38.093
It all happened so fast.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.554
I didn't realize,
I just wanted it to stop.

03:40.638 --> 03:42.723
Jamie was screaming,
Dylan was crying and...

03:42.806 --> 03:45.643
Gordon, I want you
to take a deep breath, okay?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.394
-Take a deep breath.
-(BREATHING DEEPLY)

03:48.103 --> 03:49.313
All right.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.357
Have a seat. Sit down.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.692
Okay.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.571
And, um... I...

03:58.489 --> 04:00.699
I just want you to tell me...
Tell me what happened.

04:00.783 --> 04:03.494
Okay, so I was driving,

04:04.536 --> 04:06.413
talking with Bella, my wife.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.540
Um... The boys were in the back.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.793
Jamie was playing with his iPad.

04:11.377 --> 04:14.838
Dylan grabbed it from him,
wouldn't give it back.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.468
Jamie can't control his anger.
He started punching Dylan,

04:19.551 --> 04:23.222
got out of his seatbelt
and got on top of him and kept pounding.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.225
Bella couldn't pull him off.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.519
(CRYING)

04:30.229 --> 04:35.109
I could hear Jamie's fists
cracking against Dylan's face.

04:35.192 --> 04:39.822
He was screaming for help,
so I pulled over.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.076
I just threw myself on top of Jamie.

04:44.159 --> 04:47.121
I wrapped my arms around him and held him
as tight as I could.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.164
(SOBBING)

04:52.626 --> 04:55.921
When he gets like this, the bear hugs
are the only thing that bring him back.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.089
Bring him back?

04:57.673 --> 04:58.841
From his dark place.

05:00.718 --> 05:03.512
Huh. Okay.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.683
Will you... Will you excuse me
for a moment, Gordon?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.476
Yeah.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.063
(SOBBING)

05:13.814 --> 05:16.233
NOAH: We're gonna take care
of you, little man, okay?

05:18.027 --> 05:19.278
All right.

05:24.241 --> 05:29.288
Ordered a CT, but I'm almost positive
there's a bilateral mandible fracture.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.874
Gonna need surgery to wire it shut.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.129
Man, Ethan, kid's only six years old.

05:38.464 --> 05:39.673
Jamie?

05:41.341 --> 05:45.679
He's stable, but tormented.
Dad choked him out.

05:45.763 --> 05:48.348
Probably so he couldn't defend
his little brother.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.518
Sometimes I hate the ED.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.611
Jamie, how you doing? I'm Dr. Charles.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.572
Um, would you mind
if I looked at your hands?

06:10.079 --> 06:12.581
(SIGHS) Fifth metacarpal
is broken on each hand.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.249
That's really gotta hurt.

06:14.792 --> 06:19.880
Um, look, we're gonna get you
completely fixed up, okay?

06:20.464 --> 06:22.091
It's nice to meet you.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.346
This is not child abuse.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.526
Thanks, man.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.278
You know, one of the volunteers
works at a rehab center.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.156
If you'd like,
she can tell you about their program.

06:46.782 --> 06:49.118
Yeah, sure.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.703
Maybe another time.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.792
If you change your mind, we're here.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.133
-Will.
-Yeah?

07:04.216 --> 07:07.845
You have been here for hours.
Go home, get some rest.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.557
Yeah. I could use some sleep
before I start my shift.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.892
Ah, damn it! Starts in a half-hour.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.311
Uh, okay. All right,
that woman over there, her name's Susan.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.855
When she comes down,
she's gonna be hungry.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.189
-I stashed some protein bars...
-I know.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.860
I saw. The electrolyte drinks, too.
Get to work.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.822
I'll be back later. You call me
if you need anything.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.242
(CRYING)

07:30.325 --> 07:32.870
That's the cry, that one.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.999
It's not "I'm hungry"
or "I'm tired." It's new.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.627
Okay. I know, I know, Axel.

07:40.711 --> 07:44.214
You're in pain, and my touching
is only making it worse.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.425
Any changes in his sleep pattern?

07:46.508 --> 07:48.218
No. Every baby book I read said

07:48.302 --> 07:50.304
put your child on a schedule
and stick to it.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.139
Been there. My son's almost four.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.142
I know, I know. Almost finished.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.477
Okay. What about diet?

07:57.561 --> 07:59.479
I had to start using formula.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.856
Just not enough hours in the day

08:00.939 --> 08:04.401
to pump, work, nurse,
do laundry, pump again.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.696
Single mom?
Yeah, me, too.

08:07.779 --> 08:11.116
-Dad still in the picture?
-No. But I'm okay with it.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.453
Well, I'm not seeing anything
out of the ordinary.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.163
I mean, the switch from
breast milk to formula

08:16.246 --> 08:18.040
could be upsetting Axel's stomach.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.000
Have you noticed any diarrhea
since the change?

08:20.083 --> 08:24.087
Here and there, but this cry
has been consistent for the last month.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.299
I'll test for allergies,
but infants and crying...

08:27.382 --> 08:30.677
Don't say colic.
I've been to three pediatricians.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.930
They all diagnosed colic and sent me home.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.808
No, something else is going on.

08:36.892 --> 08:40.312
Run tests, X-rays, scans.
Just please, figure it out.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.815
Okay, well, why don't we start
with some basic labs and go from there?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.402
Is that okay?

08:48.195 --> 08:49.947
-Sure. Thank you.
-(CRYING)

08:51.448 --> 08:53.116
I'll send a nurse in to get started.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.248
Thank you.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.960
Hey, Jamie, you hungry? Thirsty?

09:05.128 --> 09:07.422
I know your casts are bulky.
I can help you.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.425
I'll leave the tray
right here, just in case.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.516
(INAUDIBLE)

09:18.976 --> 09:20.602
They're talking about me.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.733
About what I did to my little brother.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.405
I didn't mean to hurt him.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.324
-Okay.
-(CRYING) I'm so sorry.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.909
It's okay, okay. Okay.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.128
After two miscarriages
and five failed IVF attempts,

09:46.211 --> 09:47.421
we'd had enough heartbreak.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.048
We adopted Jamie
when he was a few days old.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.175
Best day of our lives.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.845
Do you know anything
about his birth parents?

09:55.429 --> 09:59.391
Nothing really.
Um, Mom was young, in foster care.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.643
-We don't know anything about Dad.
-Well, Jamie's 11 now,

10:01.727 --> 10:04.646
so how old was he
when he first started acting out?

10:05.230 --> 10:08.483
As an infant, he didn't like being held,
was always fidgety.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.068
Hmm. How about as a toddler?

10:10.652 --> 10:13.697
Sitting still, taking turns,
following directions,

10:13.780 --> 10:14.948
they were all a challenge.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.160
When did Jamie's behavior
start becoming aggressive?

10:18.243 --> 10:22.956
Elementary school.
Fights with classmates and teachers.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.708
We're homeschooling now.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.253
And your other son, Dylan,
is he adopted as well?

10:28.337 --> 10:29.671
BELLA: Yeah.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.841
It was initially Jamie's idea.
He wanted to be a big brother.

10:32.924 --> 10:36.345
And in the beginning,
Dylan's presence seemed to calm Jamie.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.264
He would push his stroller,
feed him his bottle,

10:39.348 --> 10:40.515
let him climb all over him.

10:40.599 --> 10:44.311
They are so... Were so close.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.523
I'm assuming that Jamie's been
evaluated by a psychiatrist.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.775
Several.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.319
They all just add to the diagnosis.

10:52.402 --> 10:56.990
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.
Co-morbid ADHD.

10:57.074 --> 11:00.410
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.579
Tell me, what meds is he on right now?

11:03.455 --> 11:07.250
Risperidone, Valproic Acid,
Lithium, Adderall, Tenex.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.003
They all work for a bit, but then...

11:10.087 --> 11:12.381
He always ends up in his "dark place."

11:13.924 --> 11:15.258
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

11:15.342 --> 11:19.054
Mr. and Mrs. Shaw, Dylan's out of surgery.
I'll take you to Recovery.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.891
Look, what I'd like to do is admit Jamie
for a five-day hold.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.644
That'll give us a chance
to assess the situation

11:25.727 --> 11:27.020
and come up with some
treatment options for you.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.439
Anything. Please, just help him.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.113
(DOOR OPENS)

11:36.196 --> 11:38.824
Shh. He's out. Cried himself to sleep.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.242
What'd the tests say?

11:40.325 --> 11:43.954
The labs were normal, um, but the babygram
revealed a mild bowel distention.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.747
There are no obstructions,

11:45.831 --> 11:48.542
however, the stool
in Axel's diaper was watery.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.293
That suggests a GI issue.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.004
-Okay, what do you do for that?
-Endoscopy.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.756
So, under general anesthesia,

11:54.840 --> 11:56.967
a surgeon will guide
a camera down Axel's throat

11:57.050 --> 11:59.511
into his GI tract
to search for abnormalities.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.847
And if necessary,
we'll do a colonoscopy as well.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.682
Can I be there?

12:05.183 --> 12:06.643
I wouldn't recommend that.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.813
I mean, seeing the scope inside Axel,
it might be upsetting.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.816
No, I really wanna be there.

12:12.899 --> 12:16.278
Are you sure? Because I can't
overstate how distressing

12:16.361 --> 12:18.321
this procedure can be
for a parent to watch.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.615
I mean, seeing your child
on the table unconscious...

12:20.699 --> 12:22.075
I'll be okay.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.746
All right. Techs will be by shortly
to bring up Axel.

12:26.830 --> 12:27.956
I'll be there as well.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.919
-Signed.
-Thank you.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.132
Hey, Doris.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.426
Julia, the mom in Treatment Three,
did you get a read?

12:40.177 --> 12:41.553
I like her.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.556
I wish all parents would handle
the ED that smoothly.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.516
You don't think she's too composed?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.936
I mean, her son is clearly in distress
and she hasn't even broken a sweat.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.938
There's that Manning ESP again.

12:52.522 --> 12:56.318
Okay. She asked me to run
more tests on her baby than necessary,

12:56.401 --> 12:58.695
and now she wants to be front
row when he gets scoped.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.614
You don't think that's a little odd?

13:00.697 --> 13:03.116
Uh... If you say so.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.663
Call Dr. Frisch. I wanna put Axel
on today's schedule for an endoscopy.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.874
She's busy. Omphalocele repair.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.292
Gonna be locked away all day.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.586
But I'm free. I can
take care of it right now, if you'd like.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.713
Okay, thanks.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.341
Meet you upstairs. Nurse Doris.

13:19.716 --> 13:20.967
-Thank you.
-Sure.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.929
-Nurse April.
-Dr. Marcel.

13:27.641 --> 13:31.728
Okay, stomach and esophagus appear normal.
Let's reset for a colonoscopy.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.525
Julia, are you okay?

13:36.608 --> 13:38.068
You don't have to keep watching, you know.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.154
No, I'm okay. It's just...
I have a scrape on my stomach.

13:41.238 --> 13:44.032
I forgot to change the bandage, and it's
beginning to slide around.

13:44.115 --> 13:47.077
Why don't I have a nurse change that
out for you when we're back in the ED?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.037
Oh. Okay.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.206
-Yeah. Thanks.
-Yeah.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.583
Somehow I keep scraping myself
right there.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.002
I don't know how.
Mom brain, I guess.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.676
(GROANING) Right there.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.220
Okay. Sharp or dull pain, Chloe?

14:05.303 --> 14:07.430
I think both. Is that even possible?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.182
Unfortunately.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.482
How long have you been feeling off?

14:17.566 --> 14:19.734
I don't know, couple weeks.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.070
Three months. She downplays everything.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.697
(CHUCKLES)

14:23.780 --> 14:25.448
We just got married.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.367
I figured the pain
was just nervous energy.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.954
But the wedding's behind us now
and I still feel blah.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.455
Any constipation, bloating?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.374
She hasn't pooped in a week.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.378
So, Chloe, I'm gonna need to take
a closer look to see what's going on.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.672
We'll get some X-rays,
a pelvic and a rectal.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.550
Just keeping the sexy flowing, aren't I?

14:43.633 --> 14:45.427
Till death do us part.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.513
Well, a nurse will come in
and get things going.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.682
Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. James.

14:52.684 --> 14:53.685
-(PAGER CHIMES)
-Crockett.

14:53.768 --> 14:54.853
-MARCEL: Yeah?
-Perfect timing.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.898
Single vehicle accident landing now.
Massive trauma. I'll have Baghdad ready.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.692
-Got it.
-(ALARM BEEPS)

15:02.193 --> 15:03.653
What do you got?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.489
Lucy Seaver, 20, GCS three,
intubated in the field.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.284
Bilateral femur fractures
and traction splints.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.952
SATS 100% on oxygen.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.163
Okay, Lucy, don't be afraid.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.206
You're in the ED.
We're gonna take good care of you.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.333
Parents should be here any second.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.959
They were on the scene.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.336
They were in the car behind Lucy.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.046
-They saw the crash?
-And the aftermath.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.173
Lucy's car was so mangled,

15:23.256 --> 15:25.800
it took us 20 minutes to extricate her
and get her in the ambo.

15:25.884 --> 15:29.846
Okay, all right. Here we go.
On my count, one, two, three.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.272
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.277
Belly's hard as a rock.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.737
BP is 70s.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.405
Two of plasma, two of blood
on the transfuser.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.741
Trigger the MTP. Let's FAST her.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.455
Ton of soft tissue damage.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.706
Glass everywhere.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.334
All right, no, scrap the X-ray.
No time.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.835
Give me that wand.

16:06.383 --> 16:09.427
FAST is positive.
Yeah, I gotta get into her belly.

16:09.511 --> 16:12.013
All right, let's go.
(SHOUTING) Let's open up the Hybrid OR.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.516
-Oh, my God, Lucy!
-MARCEL: Get her prepped, all right?

16:14.599 --> 16:16.559
-MAN: Lucy!
-Let's get her on the move.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.980
All right.
Mr. and Mrs. Seaver, if you will.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.191
Your daughter has been seriously injured.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.652
She needs immediate surgery
to control internal bleeding.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.904
It's fixable? She's gonna live?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.572
We will do everything we can.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.955
(MRS. SEAVER SOBBING)

16:41.209 --> 16:42.252
Huh.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.796
So, uh, what is your favorite sport?

16:45.380 --> 16:47.465
Football, I guess.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.717
Bears fan?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.302
My dad likes them. I like the Chiefs.

16:51.386 --> 16:54.556
Oh, really? Well, how'd that happen?

16:54.639 --> 16:58.017
The quarterback. Saw a video of him throw
the ball out of the stadium.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.269
That was cool.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.522
I saw that clip, too.
And you're right, it was cool.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.818
You know, I was wondering if we could talk
a bit about...

17:07.485 --> 17:10.739
About what happens,
you know, about how it feels

17:10.822 --> 17:13.366
when you start to get upset?

17:15.994 --> 17:18.246
I don't know... Kind of...

17:20.123 --> 17:21.332
It's fuzzy.

17:21.416 --> 17:26.004
Fuzzy? So kind of like, um, like a dream?

17:26.755 --> 17:27.839
I guess.

17:28.798 --> 17:32.260
And when that happens,
I mean, what does it...

17:32.343 --> 17:33.678
What does it feel like?

17:33.762 --> 17:36.181
I mean, like, you know, I mean, in here?

17:36.264 --> 17:38.767
I mean, do you feel anything in your body?

17:40.101 --> 17:42.061
It feels like I'm gonna explode.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.355
Wow, I'm sorry.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.983
That must be really scary.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.401
You wanna take a little break?

17:48.485 --> 17:50.361
I want this off. It's sticking to me.
I can't stand it.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.654
DANIEL: Okay. Okay.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.739
(SCREAMING) Don't touch me!

17:52.822 --> 17:55.325
Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you!

17:55.408 --> 17:57.243
Let go! Stop it!

17:57.327 --> 17:59.204
Go away! Stop it!

17:59.287 --> 18:01.122
-Go away! Go away!
-Two of Haldol!

18:01.206 --> 18:03.875
Stop it! No! No! I don't want that!

18:03.958 --> 18:08.296
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop! No!

18:08.379 --> 18:10.381
I don't want that! Stop! Stop it!

18:13.802 --> 18:16.429
I wish I could tell you
exactly what happened in there,

18:16.513 --> 18:19.390
what triggered Jamie,
but honestly, I can't.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.892
I have reviewed his medical records.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.519
I've spoken with several of his doctors.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.605
And what is clear to me is that your son
is struggling

18:25.688 --> 18:29.400
with multiple impulse control
and mood regulation disorders.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.861
So what do we do? We just wanna help him.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.530
Well, it's the hospital's recommendation

18:33.613 --> 18:36.991
that Jamie be admitted
to a residential facility

18:37.075 --> 18:39.994
where he can receive
sustained clinical care

18:40.078 --> 18:42.038
as well as supportive therapy.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.207
-A residential facility?
-SHARON: Mmm-hmm.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.417
DANIEL: Yeah. Mrs. Shaw,
you know, Jamie's 11.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.378
Puberty is fast approaching.

18:48.461 --> 18:53.508
And that surge of hormones is just gonna
undoubtedly exacerbate his conditions.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.594
You know, just make him more difficult
to treat in general,

18:56.678 --> 18:58.596
you know, find the right balance of meds.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.473
And a specialized setting like this

19:00.557 --> 19:04.936
will have the behavioral resources
Jamie needs for the future.

19:05.019 --> 19:08.398
And it'll be a safe place
for him right now.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.484
Anything for our son.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.320
All right. I'll take care
of all the arrangements.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.036
MARCEL: Okay. Looking good.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.706
Four tears in the small bowel
mesentery tied off.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.833
Liver's packed and hemostatic.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.836
-(ALARM BEEPING)
-Pressure's no good.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.423
MARCEL: We maxed out on pressors?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.967
Yeah, and I've given ten units
of blood and ten of plasma.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.176
She's still bleeding somewhere.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.887
MARCEL: I don't...

19:40.388 --> 19:43.766
Hematoma on the pelvis.
Bigger than my first look and growing.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.560
Gotta assume the pelvis
is shattered and bleeding.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.854
Okay, team, new deal. Preperitoneal packs.
Let's go.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.735
Hey, Chloe, how you feeling?

19:53.818 --> 19:55.403
Like a stuffed turkey.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.238
X-rays showed your bowel is FOS.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.283
Full of... Stool.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.911
The pelvic suggests
your uterus is enlarged.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.163
So I suspect a fibroid
is sitting on the uterus,

20:05.246 --> 20:06.748
putting pressure on the rectum.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.291
You were right.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.502
The last few weeks she was
scouring the web with her symptoms,

20:11.586 --> 20:13.212
and a fibroid fit the bill.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.881
We're trying to have a baby.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.508
Internet says fibroids hinder the ability
to conceive.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.469
Not all fibroids are created equal.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.764
Okay, I'm gonna order a pelvic
ultrasound and a gyne consult.

20:22.847 --> 20:23.973
I'll check back soon.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.643
And no more googling, okay?
Doctor's orders.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.730
-How's it going with your six-month-old?
-Dead end.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.815
Nothing's jumping out on any of the labs

20:32.899 --> 20:34.901
and the endoscopy and colonoscopy report.

20:35.485 --> 20:38.321
I'm starting to wonder if it's really
baby Axel who's the one that's sick.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.615
-What do you mean?
-Well, Mom, she's just...

20:40.698 --> 20:44.702
She's got this air about her.
This nonchalance that screams,

20:44.786 --> 20:47.455
"Yeah, my baby's in the ED,
but it's just another day."

20:47.538 --> 20:49.666
Well, it wouldn't be the first time we see
a parent pretend

20:49.749 --> 20:52.126
their child was sick to get attention.

20:52.210 --> 20:56.130
Yeah, unfortunately.
Have you seen Dr. Charles?

20:56.214 --> 20:57.799
He's upstairs. I'll page him for you.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.133
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

20:59.801 --> 21:03.388
Dr. Manning, it's Julia.
There's something you need to see.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.850
You know, I had my appendix
taken out when I was in tenth grade.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.186
All right, well, let's take a look.

21:11.312 --> 21:14.273
Oh, my God. This is a fistula.

21:15.233 --> 21:19.445
Basically, a tunnel
between your small bowel and your skin.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.823
The green fluid is leaking from
your intestines.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.533
-Seriously?
-Mmm-hmm.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.536
I've been getting these scrapes for years.
They heal up.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.538
It's been my intestines oozing out?

21:28.621 --> 21:30.832
The tissue sample taken
during Axel's endoscopy,

21:30.915 --> 21:32.500
I'd like it biopsied.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.419
Biopsy? You're testing for cancer?

21:34.502 --> 21:35.753
No, something new.

21:35.837 --> 21:38.172
And now I'm thinking
you may have it as well.

21:38.256 --> 21:41.050
The test that I ran on your son,
I'd like to run on you as well.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.095
Okay.

21:44.679 --> 21:49.058
MARCEL: All right, pelvis is packed.
Bleeding is under control.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.394
Call ICU and tell them
Lucy is coming up to rewarm.

21:51.477 --> 21:54.022
MARTY: Something's wrong. Pressure's still
in the toilet.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.107
74 over 38 and falling.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.942
-MARCEL: What?
-She's peri-arrest.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.610
MARCEL: She's still bleeding?

22:00.486 --> 22:01.779
The abdomen is dry.

22:02.363 --> 22:05.742
Pelvis is contained.
I mean, we are hemostatic, Marty.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.036
-MARTY: She's bradying down.
-(ALARM BEEPING)

22:08.119 --> 22:09.954
-No pulse.
-MARCEL: Come on.

22:13.708 --> 22:14.917
Milligram of epi.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.173
-Epi's in. Pulse check?
-MARCEL: Go.

22:21.841 --> 22:22.842
Still nothing.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.012
Come on, Lucy.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.514
MARTY: Hold compressions.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.351
What do you got?

22:33.519 --> 22:34.520
Asystole.

22:34.604 --> 22:35.688
Come on.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.859
Come on, Lucy. Come on.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.823
Damn it!

22:47.450 --> 22:49.577
(SIGHS)

22:59.796 --> 23:02.715
Time of death, 16:17.

23:05.635 --> 23:09.680
Okay, if everyone
could clear the room, please.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.599
I'd like a moment alone with my patient.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.364
ETHAN: What's going on?

23:27.532 --> 23:29.158
There's room for Jamie at Meyerbrook,

23:29.242 --> 23:32.453
which is the only residential facility
capable of handling his needs.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.747
Unfortunately,
neither his private insurance

23:34.831 --> 23:36.666
or State Medicaid is gonna cover the cost.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.751
What about an individual
care grant from the state?

23:38.835 --> 23:40.336
I already looked into it. It's no help.

23:40.419 --> 23:44.048
Yeah, the grant's so underfunded,
it wouldn't come close to what's needed.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.466
So what's plan B?

23:45.550 --> 23:48.886
Well, you know, I'm gonna just
try to use the five-day hold

23:48.970 --> 23:50.680
to normalize his meds as best I can.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.348
And I do know a brilliant guy

23:52.431 --> 23:54.684
who specializes in these kind of disorders
that I wanna refer him to.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.312
An outpatient service?
Jamie pummeled Dylan over an iPad.

23:58.396 --> 23:59.981
The kid's jaw is wired shut.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.357
He's only six years old.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.192
He's going to invade
his brother's space again.

24:03.276 --> 24:06.654
And when that happens
and Jamie loses his temper,

24:07.363 --> 24:09.157
I'm worried he could kill Dylan.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.533
I don't like it either, Ethan,

24:10.616 --> 24:12.577
but I mean, you know,
I can't hold him here forever.

24:12.660 --> 24:16.664
I get it, but we have an obligation
to protect Dylan.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.583
And he needs our help
just as much as Jamie.

24:27.175 --> 24:30.428
Dr. Halstead, the gyne attending on call
came down a few minutes ago.

24:30.511 --> 24:31.554
She's with Chloe right now.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.097
Great, thanks.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.349
HANNAH: ...if you feel
comfortable with that.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.101
Okay.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.650
Dr. Hannah Asher, Gynecology.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.988
Will Halstead. It's nice to meet you.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.699
Yeah. Likewise.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.451
I was just explaining

24:53.534 --> 24:56.037
to Chloe and David
hat I reviewedt her pelvic ultrasound.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.497
Considering the location
and size of the fibroid,

24:58.581 --> 25:01.334
I believe removing it surgically
is the best course of treatment.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.045
A myomectomy? By who? When?

25:04.128 --> 25:06.047
Me. Today.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.967
Chloe, David, you should know
this surgery can be risky.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.429
Yes. I've explained the pros and cons,
Dr. Halstead.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.598
Was clear that
while this is a big operation,

25:15.681 --> 25:16.933
it's also a common one.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.644
You know, nevertheless,
complications could arise.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.939
So, I would suggest non-surgical options.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.982
Hormone therapy will shrink the fibroid.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.193
DAVID: Well, that's what Dr. Asher said,

25:27.276 --> 25:31.322
but to ensure that it doesn't grow back,
Chloe would have to go on the pill.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.282
We're anxious to start a family.

25:33.366 --> 25:34.909
The pill takes that off the table.

25:34.992 --> 25:37.161
In the short term, yes,
but not permanently.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.372
CHLOE: Actually, it kind of does.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.123
I'm 41, Dr. Halstead.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.751
My window for getting pregnant
is already closing.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.879
If I choose hormones,
I might as well slam it shut.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.757
DAVID: We appreciate your passion,
Dr. Halstead.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.301
But surgery is the best for us.

25:53.094 --> 25:56.055
I'll get that started.
It was so nice meeting both of you.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.099
Doctor.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.478
Excuse me just a moment.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.982
Dr. Asher? Doctor!

26:07.441 --> 26:09.527
-Hmm?
-You can't perform this surgery.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.821
-Hmm?
-I mean, you shouldn't even be working.

26:11.904 --> 26:16.033
Look, thank you for your help last week,
but I'm better now. I'm over that hump.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.035
So, heroin addiction is like a cold?

26:18.119 --> 26:20.037
-(SCOFFS)
-What, you just get over it?

26:20.121 --> 26:23.082
-What I saw at that injection site...
-Was me having a bad day.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.084
-A bad day? You...
-Mmm-hmm.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.921
You OD'd.

26:30.715 --> 26:32.883
For all I know, you're high right now.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.885
Right. And how many all-nighters

26:34.969 --> 26:36.679
you pull over there
since I saw you last, huh?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.598
Three? Four?

26:41.350 --> 26:43.144
Maybe I should be the one
worried about your judgment.

26:43.227 --> 26:46.188
Don't twist this.
I'm not an addict about to operate.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.523
(SCOFFS)

26:47.606 --> 26:50.109
You step into that OR,
you put Chloe's life in jeopardy.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.903
I would never risk
the well-being of a patient.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.576
And not that it is any of your business,
I'm sober now.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.536
I'd expect an addict to say that.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.912
(SCOFFS)

27:02.997 --> 27:05.082
Chloe is in good hands with me.

27:15.760 --> 27:19.221
Axel has Crohn's disease?
But he's only six months old.

27:19.305 --> 27:23.392
Well, it's rare in children,
let alone infants, but not unheard of.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.019
Isn't Crohn's a diet thing?

27:25.102 --> 27:26.896
Axel's barely started on solids.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.441
Well, diet aggravates Crohn's,
but it's not the cause. Genetics is.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.818
Crohn's tends to cluster in families.

27:32.902 --> 27:35.029
Whoa. My test results...

27:35.112 --> 27:36.489
Show that you have Crohn's as well.

27:36.572 --> 27:39.116
The fistula is just evidence
of the severity.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.078
This doesn't make sense.
If I've got Crohn's badly enough

27:42.161 --> 27:45.289
to burn a hole in my skin,
shouldn't it bother me?

27:45.373 --> 27:47.375
Well, fistulas themselves are painless,

27:47.458 --> 27:50.711
but, yes, a Crohn's flare-up
is excruciating.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.963
You should be in pain. Agony.

27:53.047 --> 27:55.716
Yeah, well, I don't feel a thing.

27:57.218 --> 27:58.886
This is weirding you out, isn't it?

27:58.969 --> 28:01.097
It's definitely unusual.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.897
Or actually, maybe it's...

28:10.731 --> 28:12.149
Maybe it's rare.

28:13.234 --> 28:16.946
Let me ask you a question.
What emotion are you feeling right now?

28:18.114 --> 28:20.199
Uh, I'm not sure what you mean.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.742
Well, I just told you
that you and your son

28:21.826 --> 28:23.869
have an inflammatory bowel disease.

28:23.953 --> 28:27.832
I mean, what are you feeling?
Stress? Anxiety? Fear?

28:27.915 --> 28:30.543
Confusion, that's for sure.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.797
You know what? I'd like to
run one more test. Okay?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.132
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:42.138 --> 28:45.224
B, it's taking too long.
Check with Dr. Asher?

28:45.307 --> 28:47.601
Again? I've already gone
in there twice for you, Dr. Halstead.

28:47.685 --> 28:49.728
Please, I'm treating Chloe in the ED.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.815
I just wanna make sure Dr. Asher's got
everything under control.

28:52.898 --> 28:53.899
Fine.

28:53.983 --> 28:55.317
Thank you.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.744
Dr. Asher said, "Go away."

29:06.745 --> 29:08.414
Nope. Staying right here.

29:10.207 --> 29:11.876
(ELEVATOR DINGING)

29:14.753 --> 29:15.754
ETHAN: Hey.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.883
-Got your page.
-You have a new plan to help Jamie?

29:20.426 --> 29:21.469
Yeah.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.804
Yep, I do.

29:25.806 --> 29:29.602
So, Mr. and Mrs. Shaw, I have given this
a tremendous amount of thought.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.897
I've consulted with numerous colleagues,

29:32.980 --> 29:37.234
with social workers, with our
Executive Director of Patient Services.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.739
Jamie needs to be at the Meyerbrook
Residential Facility.

29:41.822 --> 29:44.158
So the insurance companies,
they agreed to pay?

29:44.241 --> 29:48.746
No. Both your private insurance
and Medicaid won't budge.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.665
Then, uh... I'm confused.

29:51.749 --> 29:56.587
There is a way to force Medicaid
to cover Meyerbrook's cost in full.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.256
It's called a psychiatric lockout.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.677
But it will require you to surrender Jamie
to this hospital.

30:03.761 --> 30:07.389
Surrender? I don't understand.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.726
If you were to leave Jamie
here and refuse to come back,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.729
Child Protective Services
would have to take custody of him.

30:13.812 --> 30:18.234
Then, as a ward of the state, legally,
Illinois would have to provide him

30:18.317 --> 30:20.444
with the mental health
services that he needs.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.196
Meyerbrook.

30:22.279 --> 30:25.699
This is insane. We're not doing this.

30:25.783 --> 30:29.119
- So there is no other way
- I'm so sorry, but there just isn't.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.249
We would absolutely find a way
for you to maintain contact with Jamie,

30:33.332 --> 30:35.167
but you also need to know that,

30:35.251 --> 30:37.628
legally, you won't have
any say in his care.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.218
We're still his parents.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.512
This doesn't change that.
Nothing changes that.

30:46.595 --> 30:50.474
No. No, no, no.
We're not abandoning our son.

30:50.558 --> 30:52.560
Mrs. Shaw, you will not be abandoning him.

30:53.227 --> 30:55.938
This... This won't be forever.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.358
Jamie needs us to do this.

31:08.576 --> 31:09.618
When?

31:10.202 --> 31:13.872
I cannot imagine how agonizing
this decision must be,

31:14.957 --> 31:18.377
but the sooner Jamie starts to heal,

31:18.460 --> 31:22.381
the sooner you all can look forward to
becoming a family again.

to tell you. Okay?

32:04.423 --> 32:07.384
Listen, buddy, it's gonna be okay.
But right now, the best thing...

32:07.968 --> 32:10.971
We think it's better if...
For you to stay with the doctors.

32:11.055 --> 32:12.306

Dr. Marcel, Lucy's parents
are still in the waiting room.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.856
-You haven't told them...
-She should be alive.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.692
Well, it's been over an hour.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.569
They need to know
that their daughter has passed.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.989
I won't speak to them until
I can explain how she died,

33:12.866 --> 33:14.284
why I couldn't save her.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.253
Can you give me some light?

33:26.130 --> 33:27.172
Right here.

33:30.092 --> 33:33.429
Every other injury was either
a tear or a rip in the skin.

33:34.221 --> 33:36.014
This one's a hole.

33:38.142 --> 33:40.018
Something embedded inside.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.020
More shrapnel from the windshield?

33:42.104 --> 33:43.897
Doesn't really feel like glass.

33:43.981 --> 33:46.734
Can you swing that X-ray machine around?

33:57.202 --> 33:58.287
Go ahead.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.755
That's a bullet.

34:08.589 --> 34:10.507
Lucy was shot?

34:19.683 --> 34:23.020
Lucy was shot? How?

34:23.604 --> 34:27.775
She was driving down the highway,
alone in the car.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.986
The steep angle of entry
shows that the bullet struck from above

34:31.069 --> 34:33.030
and lodged into Lucy's pelvis.

34:33.113 --> 34:35.991
It severed her external iliac artery.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.243
-Shot from above?
-Yes.

34:38.869 --> 34:41.038
Now, the police will run ballistics.

34:41.121 --> 34:44.124
But they believe,
and the science backs it up,

34:44.208 --> 34:47.461
that someone, somewhere in the city,
fired a gun into the air.

34:47.544 --> 34:52.090
And when that bullet came down,
it struck Lucy.

34:53.425 --> 34:59.014
Someone? Somewhere?
And now our daughter is dead?

you ordered on Axel's mom.

Oh, wow.

35:21.829 --> 35:24.665
This whole time,
my take on Julia has been off.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.667
Way off.

NATALIE: Julia, all day I've been
troubled by your demeanor

35:50.983 --> 35:54.111
because you didn't seem
worried about Axel.

35:54.194 --> 35:57.406
But now I know
you really aren't worried.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.909
And I suspect you've never
felt anxious, depressed

36:00.993 --> 36:03.704
or even afraid your entire life,
have you?

36:03.787 --> 36:05.831
No, not really.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.542
Same goes for physical pain,
doesn't it?

36:10.043 --> 36:12.421
Kind of feels like this is
a trick question or something.

36:12.504 --> 36:17.926
No. Okay. So, when I had my son,
labor was a beast.

36:18.510 --> 36:23.307
Intense pressure, cramps, spasms.
But you didn't feel any of that, did you?

36:23.390 --> 36:27.019
Nope, whole thing just kind of tingled.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.354
But I've always had an extremely
high pain tolerance.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.316
I know. There's something
wrong with me, right?

36:32.399 --> 36:34.026
My friends have been saying it forever.

36:35.569 --> 36:38.488
Wait, is there something wrong with me?

36:38.572 --> 36:41.992
No. No. But there is something
missing from you.

36:42.075 --> 36:44.536
So, we all have what's called
a FAAHP1 pseudogene.

36:44.620 --> 36:48.123
Your preliminary blood work
shows that you have a rare microdeletion

36:48.206 --> 36:49.917
which affects your insensitivity
to pain.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.712
When I was a kid, my dad would
say everyone else were wimps,

36:53.795 --> 36:57.966
that we were a hardy breed,
that pain was just a word.

36:58.050 --> 37:01.136
Well, microdeletion is a genetic thing.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.473
So, it's likely that your father
and other family members have it as well.

37:08.810 --> 37:09.853
Julia?

37:11.355 --> 37:13.357
(JULIA CRYING)

37:18.111 --> 37:19.404
What's wrong?

37:20.030 --> 37:22.699
I passed Axel the gene for Crohn's,

37:22.783 --> 37:25.077
but not the one
so he won't be tortured by it.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.163
And if I didn't know when I hurt myself,

37:28.246 --> 37:30.374
I wouldn't have known when I hurt my son.

37:30.791 --> 37:34.461
I probably made the bath too hot,
didn't dress him warm enough...

37:34.544 --> 37:37.673
Hey, you knew it wasn't colic.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.883
You knew to bring your son into the ED.

37:41.802 --> 37:44.554
You may not feel everything he feels,

37:44.638 --> 37:48.225
but you're his mother,
you'll always know what he needs.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.114
Uh, keep going. Grab her husband,
I'll meet you in Recovery.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.868
Wonderful. You're still here.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.036
Is Chloe okay?

38:08.120 --> 38:10.622
Yeah. She's fine.
Operation was flawless.

38:11.957 --> 38:12.958
This time.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.251
(SCOFFS)

38:15.085 --> 38:17.295
How about you and I keep
our distance from one another?

38:17.379 --> 38:20.340
Yeah, fine. Just as soon as
you stop treating patients,

38:20.424 --> 38:21.717
and seek treatment for your addiction.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.968
Screw you, Halstead.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.971
In that case, I'm going to submit a letter
to the hospital's Chief Medical Officer,

38:26.054 --> 38:27.556
and that decision will be made for you.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.932
That's a stupid idea.

38:29.683 --> 38:32.561
You out me, I out your own involvement

38:32.644 --> 38:35.063
in a not-quite-legal injection site.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.482
So if I go down, so do you.

38:39.276 --> 38:41.236
So if you wanna report me,

38:43.071 --> 38:44.656
have at it, cowboy.

38:53.123 --> 38:55.333
NATALIE: Hey. Hey.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.961
Heard you had a rough one today.
You all right?

38:58.045 --> 39:03.550
Yeah. Little boy and his mom,
your ESP pan out?

39:03.633 --> 39:06.636
(CHUCKLES) Not even close.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.972
(CHUCKLES)

39:11.933 --> 39:12.976
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.102
Night.

39:25.697 --> 39:26.740
Hey.

39:29.993 --> 39:31.703
-Today sucked.
-(LAUGHS)

39:31.787 --> 39:33.872
Yes, it did.

39:34.539 --> 39:39.294
We just don't have enough
psychiatric resources for kids.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.755
And unfortunately, the Shaws

39:41.838 --> 39:44.925
won't be the last family
to face a lockout.

39:45.008 --> 39:48.261
But Jamie will get the help he needs.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.223
And that's a good thing.

40:08.698 --> 40:11.618
Hey, buddy. Come on, let's go.

40:33.723 --> 40:35.684
(CRYING)

40:56.746 --> 41:00.834
