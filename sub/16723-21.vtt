WEBVTT

00:04.271 --> 00:06.272
Come one, come all!
Come on in!

00:06.306 --> 00:08.274
You! Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

00:08.275 --> 00:10.509
Don't walk away, you coward!
Hello, children.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.278
Why aren't you spending
what little money

00:12.279 --> 00:14.447
your family has
at Wonder Wharf today?

00:14.481 --> 00:16.282
We're supposed to be
handing out these fliers,

00:16.283 --> 00:18.050
but no one's biting,
so we were about

00:18.051 --> 00:20.319
to give them all
to our old friend Gary Trashcan.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.688
You guys, we could give
Mr. Fischoeder a flier.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.457
Looks like he's
got his hands full

00:24.458 --> 00:26.359
with his own struggling
business flyers, right, buddy?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.793
What? Struggling?

00:27.794 --> 00:29.195
The wharf isn't
struggling.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.863
Ha, ha, ha.
It's great!

00:30.864 --> 00:32.798
In fact, we're giving
the whole park a facelift.

00:32.799 --> 00:35.201
And not the kind you give
to decrepit old businesses,

00:35.202 --> 00:38.304
but the kind you give to hot,
sexy, successful businesses.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.039
- You go girl.
- Hey, listen,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.641
here's three coupons
for one ride each.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.543
We've reopened
the Scream-i-cane...

00:43.544 --> 00:45.378
same thrilling ride
without any lost limbs.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.779
One hopes.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.481
Aah! The Scream-i-cane!

00:48.482 --> 00:50.850
That's the idea! Yes! Aah!
Aah!

00:50.851 --> 00:51.918
BOTH:
Aah!

00:51.919 --> 00:53.186
We'll take 'em.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.991
BOB:
<i>Hey, look.</i>

00:59.026 --> 01:00.393
I made a flower
out of a napkin.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.827
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.062
That's great, honey.
I know it is.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.031
Wow. Not so busy
today, huh, Bob?

01:05.032 --> 01:06.699
Hello, everyone.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.634
Hey, Mr. Fischoeder
number two.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.670
(laughs) Yeah, you can
call me just Felix.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.505
I'm gonna call you Lil' Fish.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.207
♪ You're a little fish,
Calvin's a big fish ♪

01:14.208 --> 01:15.975
♪ Something smells fishy,
la, la, la... ♪

01:16.009 --> 01:18.044
Stop it! I don't like
degrading nicknames!

01:18.078 --> 01:19.545
Now, if you'll allow me
to introduce you

01:19.546 --> 01:21.514
to my dirty, flirty,
little squeeze thing,

01:21.515 --> 01:24.050
Fanny, the 29-year-old
girlfriend that I have.

01:24.051 --> 01:25.718
I just bought
seven bras!

01:25.719 --> 01:26.619
Wow.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.087
Yeah.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.622
Bob, I have a proposition for you.
No.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.524
You haven't heard it yet.
How would you like...

01:31.525 --> 01:34.293
I wouldn't.
...to see this run-down old town

01:34.294 --> 01:36.395
turn into a thriving now town?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.598
No thanks.
Wait. Felix, what are you talking about?

01:38.632 --> 01:41.367
I am in the midst
of negotiations

01:41.368 --> 01:43.703
to sell Wonder Wharf
and build...

01:43.704 --> 01:45.271
high-end condos!

01:45.272 --> 01:47.740
It has a ring to it, right?
Condos?

01:47.741 --> 01:49.375
Condos.
Condos?

01:49.376 --> 01:51.277
Condos! We talking about condos here?

01:51.311 --> 01:52.778
Wait a minute.
Sell Wonder Wharf?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.447
What does Mr. Fischoeder say
about that?

01:54.481 --> 01:57.650
He says no,
because he's a big dumb wiener!

01:57.651 --> 02:00.887
He thinks he can fix that wharf
with a few "renovations"?

02:00.888 --> 02:04.123
Does putting a Band-Aid
on a fart make it go away?

02:04.158 --> 02:05.091
That doesn't make sense.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.526
Yes, it does.
I don't know.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.227
Lot of memories
on that wharf.

02:08.228 --> 02:11.297
I told Bobby I was pregnant
with Louise on the Ferris wheel.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.965
He just kept screaming. I did.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.468
The wharf was where I won
my first black light poster.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.069
Beginning of a lifelong
love affair.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.405
The first body I ever worked
on washed up under the pier.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.073
Little Italian
guy. Strangled.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.508
Aw, sweet.

02:22.509 --> 02:23.976
You don't get it.
What?

02:24.011 --> 02:25.111
They don't get it.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.479
High-end condos

02:26.480 --> 02:28.080
means rich people with money,

02:28.081 --> 02:29.916
which they will give
to your businesses,

02:29.917 --> 02:31.717
so <i> you</i> can become rich.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.287
Well, when you put it that way,
all right! I love condos!

02:34.288 --> 02:35.655
Yeah! Money, money, money. Yeah!

02:35.656 --> 02:37.056
Rich, rich, rich, rich,
rich, rich, rich.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.958
Hurray for money!

02:38.992 --> 02:40.426
Well, I don't see
how we can help,

02:40.427 --> 02:42.128
and I don't want
to help, so...

02:42.162 --> 02:43.996
Bob, I don't think I've
gotten through to you.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.765
Take a look at your
specials board.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.267
(chuckles) Do you think these
people appreciate saffron?

02:48.268 --> 02:49.669
Appreciate what
you're doing here?

02:49.703 --> 02:51.137
What is saffron,
Bobby?

02:51.138 --> 02:52.705
Uh, Mort was asking.
I already know.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.141
Is it like a food thing,
or more of an attitude?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.776
What if, on the ground floor

02:56.777 --> 02:58.478
of this condo development,
there was...

02:58.479 --> 03:00.813
(singsongy):
an upscale burger place?

03:00.814 --> 03:04.283
You could call it "Bob's Bistro
on the Beach with the Burgers."

03:04.284 --> 03:06.052
Ooh-la-la!
Hello bah jour!

03:06.053 --> 03:07.720
I could make
that happen.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.490
Hmm. You've described
a secret fantasy of mine.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.325
I mean, a nice restaurant,
upscale location.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.460
I wouldn't name it that,
but I'd like to-to...

03:14.461 --> 03:17.196
B-Bob, Bob, will you help me
with something in the bathroom?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.865
What? Um, no.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.366
Uh, uh.
Felix, I don't want to go, so...

03:20.367 --> 03:21.701
And yet, here
I am pulling you.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.170
Yes, you are. Linda?
Bye, Bobby!

03:24.204 --> 03:25.838
(both grunting)

03:25.839 --> 03:27.306
(people screaming)

03:27.307 --> 03:28.941
The Scream-i-cane.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.710
We're going on it.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.513
Or... hear me out...
we <i>don't</i> go on it.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.314
Ooh, interesting.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.183
I'll go on it,
but only if you guys go

03:37.184 --> 03:38.551
on the carousel with me after.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.353
I want to go visit Mr. Goiter.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.721
You never forget
your first horse love.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.756
(calliope music playing)

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.033 --> 03:55.067
Fine, we'll go
on the Scream-i-cane,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.903
then the boring carousel
with the freakish horse

03:56.904 --> 03:58.838
with a lump on it's neck. Yay!

03:58.872 --> 04:01.374
Hey, burger babies!

04:01.408 --> 04:02.842
BOTH:
Hey, Mickey.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.544
Three of your finest seats,
please, Mickey.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.279
Gee. Sorry, Louise.
You're too short.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.647
I can't let you ride.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.582
Oh, too bad!
Bye-bye.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.084
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, what's
a couple inches between friends?

04:12.119 --> 04:13.519
Wouldn't be safe,
and I also happen

04:13.520 --> 04:15.354
to be up for
Employee of the Month.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.055
We get our pick
of the stuffed animals,

04:17.057 --> 04:19.425
and I have my eye on a banana
wearing Bermuda shorts.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.527
What?! Louise, let's just go. Come on.

04:21.528 --> 04:25.531
Oh, I hope you're happy
with your shorts-wearing banana!

04:25.532 --> 04:27.500
Your only friend now, Mickey!

04:27.534 --> 04:29.936
Enjoy the park!
Don't talk to me!

04:29.970 --> 04:32.004
Oh, Felix also
bought me these.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.207
What?
These. Blink, blink, blink.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.575
Y-Your eyeballs?

04:35.576 --> 04:36.976
The lashes.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.478
Oh, they're beautiful.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.812
Yeah, they're
weasel fur.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.247
I knew it.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.615
Oh, and when
the condos go in,

04:42.649 --> 04:45.118
Felix is gonna build me
a recording studio.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.619
What?
Also a nightclub.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.054
Oh. 'Cause I have a really good voice,

04:48.055 --> 04:49.455
so I'm gonna sing
at the nightclub.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.723
I love nightclubs
and singing!

04:50.724 --> 04:52.058
Sing me a song.
Okay.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.559
She's gonna sing!

05:06.173 --> 05:08.841
Yes, Bob's Burgers
on the Beach sounds nice,

05:08.842 --> 05:11.577
but I still don't see what
you need me for in all this.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.446
Also, I wish
you weren't peeing right now.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.982
Look, Bob. God, I love this
bathroom I built for you.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.750
I just do.
Felix!

05:17.785 --> 05:21.354
Okay! I need you
for a covert operation.

05:21.355 --> 05:24.257
Phase one: you call Calvin
with some reason

05:24.258 --> 05:27.093
to get him away from the wharf
at 1:00 p.m. today

05:27.094 --> 05:28.694
so I can
take the developers around.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.630
Oh, God.
I don't like phase one.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.165
Phase two:
you work on him.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.599
Convince him to sell.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.001
Me work on him? Why me?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.536
He listens to you.
Mm.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.204
You remind him of our
father for some reason.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.705
Maybe something
about that arm hair.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.307
He is always staring at it. Yeah.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.775
I understand why.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.510
It's exactly our
papa's arm hair.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.212
That's pretty crazy. I...

05:46.213 --> 05:47.914
Hi, Daddy.
Um...

05:47.948 --> 05:50.116
Too short? I'm not
too short. I'm perfect!

05:50.117 --> 05:51.684
Hey, I know
what this gang needs...

05:51.685 --> 05:53.687
a trip
to merry-go-round town.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.288
(humming)

05:55.289 --> 05:56.789
What?

05:56.824 --> 05:59.158
"Carousel no longer
in service"?

05:59.193 --> 06:01.561
"Newer, better,
less boring ride coming soon"?

06:01.562 --> 06:02.995
Let's take it down, fellas.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.797
(Tina yells)

06:04.798 --> 06:05.832
Mr. Goiter!

06:05.866 --> 06:07.366
Whoa!

06:07.367 --> 06:09.602
Merry-go-down, am I right?
Too soon.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.638
Please, Bob, just keep my
brother away from the wharf

06:12.639 --> 06:15.575
for a couple of hours, work
your arm hair magic on him,

06:15.576 --> 06:17.844
and you can have the
beachfront restaurant

06:17.845 --> 06:19.212
you've always wanted.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.847
(sighs):
Oh, I don't know.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.649
This whole thing doesn't
seem completely right.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.352
Bob's Bistro on the
Beach with the Burgers.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.421
I still don't want
to name it that.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.523
Do we have a deal?
(sighs)

06:30.524 --> 06:32.658
Okay, deal.
(laughs maniacally)

06:32.659 --> 06:34.394
But why are you doing that?

06:34.395 --> 06:36.662
Oh, I was just thinking of
something from earlier today.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.064
Well, now I feel
weird about this,

06:38.065 --> 06:39.499
'cause you're laughing
like that.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.833
No, no, no,
it's-it's fine.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.668
(laughing manically)
You're doing it again.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.571
All right, come
on, let's shake.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.907
(chanting):
Uh! Mr. Dance Floor!

06:47.908 --> 06:49.776
Ooh!
Mr. Dance Floor!

06:49.777 --> 06:51.844
Wonder Wharf is open for business!
(chanting continues)

06:51.845 --> 06:55.014
Hey, you... you don't look
like you have a job. Come in!

06:55.049 --> 06:56.249
TINA:
<i>No!</i>

06:56.283 --> 06:57.417
You bastards!

06:57.451 --> 07:00.019
Whoa. I just got
a weird feeling.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.423
Well, I didn't wash my hands,
so it could be my pee pee.

07:04.649 --> 07:07.451
Okay, so you're telling me that
Felix gave you a covert mission

07:07.452 --> 07:10.487
to keep Mr. Fischoeder away from
the wharf for a couple hours...

07:10.488 --> 07:12.957
Uh-huh. ...so that Felix can
take his developers around,

07:12.958 --> 07:14.558
get 'em interested.
Uh-huh.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.794
And while we've got him,
you have to somehow

07:16.795 --> 07:18.829
convince Fischoeder to
sell Wonder Wharf? Yup.

07:18.830 --> 07:20.965
And we get a restaurant on
the beach, and we all get rich?

07:20.999 --> 07:22.399
Yes.
Great. Easy peasy.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.968
You think?
Yeah.

07:23.969 --> 07:25.836
Aw, look at you,
humble little burger man

07:25.837 --> 07:27.504
deciding the fate
of the whole town.

07:27.505 --> 07:29.206
I'm not little.
Little burger boy wonder.

07:29.207 --> 07:31.675
Ooh, I'm gonna make you
a T-shirt that says that.

07:31.676 --> 07:33.277
I won't wear it.
You will.

07:33.311 --> 07:36.080
So, a lie to keep Mr. Fischoeder
busy for a few hours.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.581
Ooh! I got an idea!
Mm-hmm.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.183
We call him up, tell him

07:39.184 --> 07:40.951
we're looking to swing,
see if he's into it.

07:40.986 --> 07:43.020
Um, no?
What? We're cute.

07:43.021 --> 07:44.388
Hmm.
Oh!

07:44.389 --> 07:46.824
What about Take Your
Landlord to Lunch Day?

07:46.825 --> 07:49.026
We tell him it's
Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day?

07:49.027 --> 07:51.262
Yeah. Hmm. He does like lunch.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.863
He loves lunch.
God, I'm hungry.

07:52.864 --> 07:54.064
Me, too. Let's
eat first.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.499
Lady Big Nose, no!

07:55.534 --> 07:57.167
Oh!
Oh!

07:57.168 --> 07:58.903
Mr. Down There Hair!

07:58.904 --> 07:59.670
Ooh!
Aah!

07:59.671 --> 08:01.572
Henry Human Feet!

08:01.573 --> 08:03.040
His feet were more human
than mine!

08:03.041 --> 08:04.608
Boss, I don't know
what to do here.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.210
Listen, little girl,

08:06.244 --> 08:08.712
Mr. Fischoeder wants us
to take down the carousel.

08:08.713 --> 08:10.447
No one rides
it anymore.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.516
Possibly because they're put
off by the deformed horses.

08:12.517 --> 08:14.084
This one makes me
a little sick.

08:14.085 --> 08:15.586
I don't care
about your facelift!

08:15.587 --> 08:17.188
Nobody touches Mr. Goiter!

08:17.189 --> 08:18.589
He's a hideous delight!

08:18.590 --> 08:19.957
Oh. Oh, man!

08:19.958 --> 08:21.525
Tina, got an idea!
Be right back!

08:21.526 --> 08:24.195
Okay. Oh, no!
Dr. Big Butt!

08:24.229 --> 08:27.097
Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day? Yup.

08:27.098 --> 08:29.266
And you want to go
to King's Head island?

08:29.301 --> 08:31.669
It's your special day. (Fanny humming)

08:31.703 --> 08:33.837
Fanny, you want
to come to lunch?

08:33.871 --> 08:35.371
Mm-kay!
Hop in!

08:35.407 --> 08:36.472
(humming)

08:36.474 --> 08:37.808
Hi. Hi.
How are you?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.309
Ooh, what'd you get?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.811
It's a skirt, but
I'm gonna wear it

08:40.812 --> 08:42.446
as a dress so you
can see my butt.

08:42.447 --> 08:43.914
Butt-dress.
I like it!

08:43.914 --> 08:46.150
Butt-dress, butt-dress golly. (laughs)

08:46.151 --> 08:48.652
(whispering loudly): Psst.
Fanny, want to hear a secret?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.654
We're doing the plan.
Hmm?

08:50.655 --> 08:53.424
BOB: Lin? Felix is planning to get
Fischoeder away from the wharf.

08:53.458 --> 08:56.193
BOB: Lin? LINDA: He doesn't have
any idea. He doesn't have a clue.

08:56.228 --> 08:57.761
Linda, we can hear you.

08:57.762 --> 08:59.363
What? No.
It's girl talk.

08:59.397 --> 09:00.831
(whispering loudly):
They can't understand us.

09:00.832 --> 09:01.832
Oh, my God.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.400
Bob?
Yes?

09:03.401 --> 09:06.303
There is no Take Your Landlord
to Lunch Day, is there?

09:06.304 --> 09:09.306
Oh, maybe they can
understand us. Little bit.

09:09.307 --> 09:11.208
Damn. I was really
excited about it.

09:11.243 --> 09:13.811
Landlords never get any fun stuff.
LINDA: Aw.

09:13.812 --> 09:15.679
I just got a refill.
What'd I miss?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.147
Well, the workers
went on break,

09:17.148 --> 09:18.949
so I'm just taking
a little breather.

09:18.950 --> 09:21.051
They're not on break.
They're right there. What?!

09:21.086 --> 09:23.554
You said you were gonna sit with
your lunch boxes and chitchat!

09:23.588 --> 09:25.389
We ran out of stuff
to talk about.

09:25.423 --> 09:28.559
Well, I... How about, um, like,
what you did this weekend?

09:28.593 --> 09:30.427
Sorry, kid,
but we got to do this.

09:30.462 --> 09:32.029
(sighs)
Fine.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.764
Just, let me
say good-bye.

09:33.765 --> 09:34.798
Okay.

09:34.799 --> 09:37.635
♪ Good-bye, Mr. Goiter ♪

09:37.636 --> 09:40.571
♪ I love you so much ♪

09:40.605 --> 09:42.506
Nice bike lock.
It's Teddy's.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.475
He was hoping
it'd inspire him to get a bike.

09:44.509 --> 09:45.943
Tina.
What?

09:45.944 --> 09:47.711
Put your head right there.
Okay.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.380
Hey!
Oh. I wish I could have gotten

09:49.381 --> 09:51.849
in a more comfortable position.
Now swallow the key.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.651
What is going on?!

09:53.652 --> 09:55.619
And that's how you lock
your sister to a wooden horse!

09:55.620 --> 09:57.021
Yeah! Um, unrelated...

09:57.022 --> 09:59.682
does anyone have any water
or some pudding?

10:00.190 --> 10:01.491
So, as you can see,

10:01.492 --> 10:03.849
incredible ocean views,
and a girl

10:03.850 --> 10:05.784
bike-locked to the carousel.
What? I didn't say that.

10:05.785 --> 10:07.119
Okay, snow cones on me.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.721
Go pick out your flavors,
go crazy.

10:08.722 --> 10:10.089
I'll be right back.

10:10.123 --> 10:11.757
Hi, how you doing?
Greetings.

10:11.791 --> 10:13.325
Um, what are you doing?

10:13.359 --> 10:14.793
I've bike-locked myself

10:14.794 --> 10:16.195
to Mr. Goiter to save him.
Yeah.

10:16.229 --> 10:18.664
Leave now,
or I will make you leave.

10:18.698 --> 10:20.199
Oh, do you have
the ability

10:20.200 --> 10:21.900
to make 13-year-old
girls poop out keys?

10:21.901 --> 10:23.502
He might! Don't
look in his eyes!

10:23.536 --> 10:25.671
This guy's trying
to make my sister poop!

10:25.672 --> 10:27.139
(laughs):
No, I am not!

10:27.140 --> 10:29.141
Girl-pooper!
Girl-pooper!

10:29.142 --> 10:30.676
Girl-pooper!
Shut up!

10:30.677 --> 10:32.878
This is boarding school
all over again!

10:32.879 --> 10:34.813
Boarding school
sounds fun.

10:34.814 --> 10:36.849
FISCHOEDER: So, Felix put you
up to this, huh?

10:36.850 --> 10:38.450
Kidnapping me so he can show

10:38.485 --> 10:41.320
his developers around
my wharf parts?

10:41.321 --> 10:42.921
No. Yes.

10:42.922 --> 10:44.757
Well, I want to go shopping.
I want some new stuff.

10:44.758 --> 10:47.426
What? You can't just leave
a kidnapping to go shopping.

10:47.427 --> 10:48.827
This isn't Florida.

10:48.862 --> 10:50.229
BOTH:
Bye!

10:50.230 --> 10:51.497
(humming)

10:51.498 --> 10:52.798
Shop!
Yeah.

10:52.832 --> 10:53.832
(sighs)

10:53.833 --> 10:55.768
So, you're probably mad.

10:55.769 --> 10:57.169
Not really.
Doesn't matter.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.737
I'm not going to sell,
anyway, ever.

10:58.738 --> 11:00.239
So, we might as well eat.
Right?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.607
Uh, yeah. Oh, my God.

11:01.608 --> 11:02.608
I... forgot my wallet.

11:02.609 --> 11:04.176
Ah! Imagine.

11:04.177 --> 11:05.944
Uh, you could cover
and I'll get you back.

11:05.945 --> 11:07.679
You want to do that?

11:07.680 --> 11:10.215
Of course. Why wouldn't I pay
for my own kidnapping lunch?

11:11.885 --> 11:13.419
(quietly): All right.
Bob's Bistro on the Beach.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.320
Bob's Bistro on the Beach.
Here we go.

11:15.355 --> 11:18.023
Mr. Fischoeder, I know you said
you weren't gonna sell ever,

11:18.024 --> 11:20.092
but if you did sell
the wharf, you could...

11:20.093 --> 11:22.294
I told you, Bob,
it's off the table.

11:22.295 --> 11:24.363
Now, uh,
what to talk about.

11:24.364 --> 11:26.398
What do you think of...
loose women?

11:26.399 --> 11:27.766
(music playing)
I like them.

11:27.801 --> 11:29.968

13:01.461 --> 13:02.961
Sorry. Terribly sorry.
Yeah. Thank you.

13:02.962 --> 13:04.296
Got carried away.

13:04.331 --> 13:05.535
LINDA:
<i>So...</i>

13:05.565 --> 13:06.999
did you guys
have fun?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.635
Uh, yeah. We, uh,
shared a moment.

13:09.636 --> 13:11.236
I think.
Or maybe not.

13:11.237 --> 13:12.638
I don't know.
This is a disaster.

13:12.639 --> 13:13.872
Bob?
Yeah?

13:13.873 --> 13:15.674
I don't know
what it is about you,

13:15.675 --> 13:17.576
you bushy-armed bastard.
Um...

13:17.577 --> 13:19.712
But you've convinced me
to sell Wonder Wharf.

13:19.713 --> 13:21.246
Really?
That-That's great.

13:21.247 --> 13:23.215
Hooray! Hooray!
All right!

13:23.216 --> 13:25.484
Have you ever tried
brushing it this way? Like this?

13:25.485 --> 13:27.820
No, uh, but I will.

13:27.821 --> 13:29.221
It's a good look for you.

13:29.222 --> 13:31.056
Calvin, where
have you been?

13:31.057 --> 13:32.725
What have I been doing?
Just, you know,

13:32.726 --> 13:34.259
had myself
kind of a chill-out day.

13:34.260 --> 13:35.995
You know, made a collage,
skipped a rock.

13:35.996 --> 13:37.529
Felix, listen.

13:37.564 --> 13:40.032
You can tell your developers
that I'll sell.

13:40.033 --> 13:42.001
(exclaims)
Yah mo be there!

13:42.002 --> 13:44.036
Let's start calling
the lawyers!

13:44.037 --> 13:45.437
What's going on
over at the wharf?

13:45.438 --> 13:46.405
Oh, nothing,
nothing.

13:46.406 --> 13:47.306
Lot of people.

13:47.340 --> 13:48.474
Are those news trucks?

13:48.508 --> 13:49.908
Hey. Don't worry about that.

13:49.909 --> 13:51.343
Look at me.
Check this out. Here we go.

13:51.344 --> 13:52.911
Go down, and then my arms
go back and forth,

13:52.912 --> 13:54.179
I lift my leg up and...

13:54.214 --> 13:55.714
Why have you
locked yourself

13:55.715 --> 13:57.049
to this horse,
young lady?

13:57.083 --> 13:59.618
Well, um, he has a name;
it's Mr. Goiter.

13:59.619 --> 14:01.320
Oh, there's my dad. Dad!

14:01.354 --> 14:02.855
They want to destroy
the carousel.

14:02.856 --> 14:05.057
You have to help me stop them.
Tina!

14:05.058 --> 14:06.859
Aw, you look so pretty
for the news.

14:06.893 --> 14:08.560
Tina, I know
you love the carousel,

14:08.561 --> 14:10.462
but I have to tell you
something.

14:10.463 --> 14:13.065
(quietly): They're tearing down
Wonder Wharf to build condos.

14:13.066 --> 14:15.605
(crowd gasps)
No...!

14:15.635 --> 14:17.503
Uh, you weren't
supposed to hear that.

14:17.537 --> 14:18.737
It's for the best.

14:18.738 --> 14:20.272
You understand,
right, honey?

14:20.307 --> 14:22.445
Damn you all to hell!

14:22.475 --> 14:24.243
Yup, so... great.

14:24.244 --> 14:25.811
They're tearing
down Wonder Wharf?

14:25.812 --> 14:27.146
What if I grow?

14:27.147 --> 14:29.148
What rides am I
gonna ride on now?!

14:29.149 --> 14:30.616
Why even grow?!

14:30.617 --> 14:33.052
And what do I do with
10,000 skee-ball tickets?!

14:33.053 --> 14:35.287
I've been saving up
for the Pontiac Solstice!

14:35.288 --> 14:37.756
Mr. Fischoeder, is this true?
Are you selling the Wharf?

14:37.757 --> 14:39.725
Uh, yes, it's, uh...
Uh, Calvin, Calvin.

14:39.726 --> 14:41.060
Can I take this one?

14:41.094 --> 14:42.161
Hi, I'm Felix Fischoeder.

14:42.162 --> 14:43.729
The other odor.
(chuckles)

14:43.730 --> 14:45.931
Listen, folks, once those
wealthy condo owners

14:45.932 --> 14:47.733
start patronizing
your businesses,

14:47.767 --> 14:51.437
your disappointing, fruitless
lives will be full of fruit,

14:51.438 --> 14:54.477
because you will be
rich enough to buy fruit.

14:54.507 --> 14:56.742
Yeah. Sweet condo-people money.

14:56.743 --> 14:58.077
That's right!
That's right!

14:58.078 --> 14:59.411
That's right!
That's right!

14:59.412 --> 15:00.479
Let's get their money!

15:00.480 --> 15:01.780
All right.

15:01.815 --> 15:03.916
Hey, I know you got
a lot going on here,

15:03.917 --> 15:05.150
but, uh, here's
what we're gonna do.

15:05.151 --> 15:06.619
We're gonna
cut out this pole,

15:06.653 --> 15:08.354
pull you off
with a forklift,

15:08.355 --> 15:09.655
and... hopefully,
it's safe.

15:09.656 --> 15:10.923
What?

15:10.957 --> 15:12.324
LINDA:
What's happening?

15:12.359 --> 15:14.193
What's going on?
What is happening?

15:14.194 --> 15:15.995
What is happening?!
Tina!

15:16.029 --> 15:17.496
Uh...

15:17.497 --> 15:19.632
Well, at least
Mr. Goiter's okay.

15:19.666 --> 15:20.666
(screams)

15:20.700 --> 15:23.002
Tina, my precious
baby angel!

15:23.036 --> 15:24.203
Tina, are you
all right?

15:24.204 --> 15:26.305
No, I'm not!
First Mr. Fischoeder

15:26.306 --> 15:27.840
wants to tear down
the carousel,

15:27.874 --> 15:29.808
now you want to tear down
the whole wharf?

15:29.809 --> 15:32.311
This place means a lot
to a lot of people.

15:32.312 --> 15:33.512
What's wrong
with you?!

15:33.513 --> 15:34.847
Okay, honey,
you're hysterical.

15:34.848 --> 15:36.048
It's all right.
Come here.

15:36.049 --> 15:37.283
(grunts)
Mama's gonna hug you

15:37.284 --> 15:38.851
back to normal.
Come on.

15:38.852 --> 15:41.387
This park is like...
like the heart of the town.

15:41.388 --> 15:42.688
Shu-shush, shush,
shush, shush.

15:42.689 --> 15:44.290
Shu-shush, shush,
shush, shush.

15:44.291 --> 15:47.026
Oh, my God. You're right.
Tina's right.

15:47.027 --> 15:49.228
I was gonna say all that stuff!
You were?

15:49.229 --> 15:51.617
No, but you guys
are getting so clique-ish!

15:52.893 --> 15:55.395
So you convinced
Mr. Fischoeder to sell?

15:55.429 --> 15:57.196
Yes.
To build condos?

15:57.197 --> 15:59.432
As in condominiums?
Yes.

15:59.466 --> 16:01.467
Dad, I love you, but what
the hell were you thinking,

16:01.468 --> 16:03.036
you idiot?
Sorry, I love you.

16:03.070 --> 16:04.771
Oh, God, I-I got to go
talk to him.

16:04.772 --> 16:06.372
No! The condos!
The money!

16:06.373 --> 16:08.041
Hey, I got an idea,
let's go get pretzels.

16:08.075 --> 16:09.809
Lin, I-I knew Felix was wrong,

16:09.810 --> 16:11.578
but I let myself
get talked into it.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.912
I got to go fix this.

16:12.913 --> 16:14.781
Just be rational!

16:14.782 --> 16:16.249
Linda.

16:16.250 --> 16:17.417
Linda, let go.
(growls)

16:17.418 --> 16:18.718
Linda, stop it.

16:18.719 --> 16:19.886
You're hurting me!

16:19.887 --> 16:22.255
Mom, let him go.
Let him go, Mom!

16:22.256 --> 16:24.257
Drag her off me!
Don't do it!

16:24.258 --> 16:25.792
No, you let him go!
Don't you do it!

16:25.793 --> 16:26.893
Get her off!

16:26.894 --> 16:28.561
(all grunting)

16:28.562 --> 16:29.662
Nuts.

16:29.663 --> 16:30.930
Now, these condo people...

16:30.931 --> 16:32.265
what percentage
of their income

16:32.266 --> 16:34.133
would you say
they spend on yarn?

16:34.168 --> 16:35.969
Oh, what a good question.

16:35.970 --> 16:37.003
Roughly 45%.

16:37.004 --> 16:39.239
That's not very high!

16:39.273 --> 16:41.574
Hey, Mr. Fischoeder, could
I speak to you for a minute?

16:41.575 --> 16:43.276
In private?
Yes. Please.

16:43.277 --> 16:45.111
These people
keep talking to me.

16:45.112 --> 16:46.946
Uh, how about
we go on a ride?

16:46.947 --> 16:49.315
Hey, I heard good things
about the Scream-i-cane.

16:49.316 --> 16:50.483
Okay, what the hell.

16:50.484 --> 16:51.851
Come on, Gene.
We're going, too.

16:51.852 --> 16:53.853
I told you, no
roller coasters!

16:53.854 --> 16:56.089
The technology just
isn't there yet!

16:56.123 --> 16:57.790
Now here's
a question for you.

16:57.825 --> 16:59.959
Who likes nightclubs
with a Caribbean theme

16:59.960 --> 17:03.663
and a 29-year-old singer
who happens to be my girlfriend?

17:03.664 --> 17:05.265
(giggles)
It's me.

17:05.299 --> 17:06.598
Hey, Mr. Fischoeder.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.101
You're looking
rich today, sir.

17:08.102 --> 17:10.837
Hey, we're with the boss
man, Mickey, so lay off!

17:10.838 --> 17:12.972
Yup, safety second,
that's what I always say.

17:12.973 --> 17:16.009
Stop us! Stop us!
You're terrible at your job!

17:16.010 --> 17:17.477
We appreciate your feedback.

17:17.511 --> 17:19.345
I'm gonna die and I never

17:19.346 --> 17:21.314
got to see
Hall & Oates live!

17:21.348 --> 17:23.348
So, you can't sell the wharf.
Really?

17:23.349 --> 17:24.651
Yes.
Great.

17:24.685 --> 17:26.719
Hey, I have some laundry here.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.655
Maybe I'll just
throw it into you,

17:28.656 --> 17:30.591
big fat washing machine man.

17:30.624 --> 17:32.760
What?
'Cause you're wishy-washy!

17:32.793 --> 17:35.179
You just convinced me
to sell the wharf.

17:35.196 --> 17:38.641
Look, Mr. Fischoeder,
I was wrong. I got greedy.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.201
(all screaming)
BOB: I don't feel good!

17:41.235 --> 17:43.536
FISCHOEDER: Good!
LOUISE: Yeah!

17:43.571 --> 17:45.572
I got caught up
in having this nice place

17:45.573 --> 17:47.207
on the beach,
selling burgers to...

17:47.241 --> 17:49.976
Oh, God... fancy rich people.

17:50.010 --> 17:53.112
Aah! Why did I think this
would be a good place to talk?!

17:53.147 --> 17:55.849
'Cause you're an idiot!

17:55.883 --> 17:57.617
Hmm.

17:57.651 --> 17:59.552
It always seems to get stuck
here on the big hill.

17:59.587 --> 18:01.221
And then the limbs
come off.

18:01.255 --> 18:02.889
Oh, God.
Louise, is it over?

18:02.890 --> 18:04.991
Am I home on the couch
watching <i> The Closer</i> yet?

18:04.992 --> 18:06.426
Yup.
Aah!

18:06.427 --> 18:08.361
This episode takes place
on the Scream-i-cane!

18:08.395 --> 18:10.396
Wow. It's beautiful.
Are you going to try to kiss me?

18:10.397 --> 18:11.924
What?

18:11.932 --> 18:13.333
Well, you used to be straight,

18:13.334 --> 18:14.844
but who knows
with Mr. Flippy Floppy?

18:14.869 --> 18:16.369
Mr. Fischoeder, listen.

18:16.370 --> 18:17.904
I thought I wanted nice things,

18:17.905 --> 18:19.932
but I don't even
like nice things.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.241
I mean, look at this shirt.

18:21.242 --> 18:22.609
This is my favorite shirt.

18:22.610 --> 18:24.911
Ooh. That is so sad.

18:24.912 --> 18:27.940
Look, those condos would
make us like everywhere else.

18:27.948 --> 18:29.849
The wharf is the
heart of the town.

18:29.850 --> 18:31.684
It's what makes
this place special.

18:31.685 --> 18:34.420
I mean, sure, it's run down,
it-it's really seedy,

18:34.421 --> 18:36.856
it's kind of dirty, they
don't pick up the garbage.

18:36.857 --> 18:39.092
Mm.
But it's also great.

18:39.093 --> 18:41.261
Hmm. So, are they gonna
chopper us out of here or...

18:41.262 --> 18:43.196
(all screaming)

18:45.533 --> 18:47.367
(Louise whoops)

18:47.401 --> 18:50.103
Oh, God, off.
Yes, off.

18:50.104 --> 18:51.938
We did it! I lived.

18:51.939 --> 18:54.274
I knew that rules didn't
apply to me. I knew it!

18:54.275 --> 18:56.743
Whew! My pants
are moist but not wet.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.278
Oh, that part's wet.

18:58.279 --> 18:59.813
Boy, it's been a long time
since I've been

18:59.814 --> 19:01.281
on a ride; they're wonderful.

19:01.315 --> 19:02.782
(laughs) Papa always said
people like things

19:02.783 --> 19:04.551
that go up and down
and side to side

19:04.552 --> 19:06.219
and jiggle all
their stuff around.

19:06.220 --> 19:08.321
And mother sewed that on a pillow.
That's nice.

19:08.322 --> 19:09.923
I'm never selling
Wonder Wharf.

19:09.924 --> 19:11.157
What?
Never!

19:11.158 --> 19:12.158
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:12.159 --> 19:13.760
What are you saying?!

19:13.794 --> 19:17.564
I'm not ever
selling this wharf!

19:17.598 --> 19:18.832
What?!

19:18.833 --> 19:20.266
No, no, no, no, no!

19:20.267 --> 19:21.234
Damn it!

19:21.268 --> 19:22.335
Linda!
Wha...?

19:22.336 --> 19:23.937
I'm going on again.
Me, too!

19:23.971 --> 19:25.905
And here I come, too.

19:25.906 --> 19:29.209
Clop, clop, clop, clop,
clop, clop, clop, clop.

19:29.243 --> 19:31.511
Felix, what about
my nightclub?

19:31.512 --> 19:33.012
Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny,
Fanny, Fanny, Fanny...

19:33.013 --> 19:34.948
No! You're not
getting any of this.

19:34.949 --> 19:36.082
Or this.
What?

19:36.083 --> 19:38.051
Or even this.
(screams)

19:38.085 --> 19:39.319
Thanks for
saving the town, Dad.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.020
You're welcome, Tina.

19:41.021 --> 19:42.922
Thanks for reminding me
what's important.

19:42.923 --> 19:45.158
Yeah, sure. Hey have you ever
pooped out a key?

19:45.159 --> 19:47.527
No. Um... dice.

19:47.528 --> 19:49.429
Mm. Well, okay,
I'll figure it out.

19:50.698 --> 19:53.266
So, we really
did it, huh?

19:53.267 --> 19:54.801
Well, I did it.
You almost blew it.

19:54.835 --> 19:56.636
Yeah, but then I
brought it all home,

19:56.637 --> 19:58.838
kind of heroically... not to
pat myself on the back, but...

19:58.839 --> 20:00.106
Felix.

20:00.107 --> 20:01.908
There you are.
Uh, sorry.

20:01.942 --> 20:04.177
I, uh... I realized
what you were trying to do was

20:04.178 --> 20:06.646
horribly wrong and...
is that a gun?

20:06.680 --> 20:09.649
Yup. It sure is.
It's where I keep my bullets.

20:09.683 --> 20:12.085
(nervous laugh) Okay, well,
I'm going to, uh, head out.

20:12.119 --> 20:13.620
No, no!
No, no, no.

20:13.654 --> 20:15.622
(laughs maniacally)

20:15.656 --> 20:17.323
Oh, he's doing
that laugh.

20:17.324 --> 20:19.058
I don't like that.
No.

20:19.059 --> 20:21.861
Are you thinking of something
funny from earlier today?

20:21.896 --> 20:24.364
No! I'm laughing maniacally!
Okey dokey.

20:24.398 --> 20:27.033
Glad you like this
rotten old wharf so much,

20:27.034 --> 20:28.501
'cause it's where
they're going to find

20:28.502 --> 20:30.136
your rotten old bodies.

20:30.171 --> 20:32.972
Hey, hey. I-I don't think
you have a rotten old body.

20:32.973 --> 20:35.175
Um, I think he's talking
to both of us, right?

20:35.176 --> 20:36.743
No, no, no. Can't be.

20:36.744 --> 20:39.145
You're the old one. Look at your face.
What?

20:39.180 --> 20:40.747
Shut up! You're both old
and you're both gonna die!

20:40.748 --> 20:42.382
Oh, so you did mean both of us.
Yeah.

20:42.383 --> 20:43.950
(gunshot)
Quiet, please!
