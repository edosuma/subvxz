THE LIST IS COMING DOWN,
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN,

00:10.410 --> 00:12.412
AND NOW, I'M FAR
FROM BEING SOLD OUT.

00:12.445 --> 00:13.780
- ONE OF THE BUYERS
THAT I HAVE

00:13.813 --> 00:15.248
IS STILL VERY INTERESTED.

00:15.281 --> 00:17.517
- PRICE IS 1,175,000.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.386
- AND THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE AVAILABLE?

00:19.419 --> 00:20.487
- NO.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.555
IT'S SUPPLY AND DEMAND,
ISN'T IT?

00:22.589 --> 00:24.557
- FINE.
SO WE'LL DO 6C.

00:24.591 --> 00:25.558
- CHING! CHING!

00:25.592 --> 00:27.660
- I HATE LOOKING AT YOUR FACE.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.562
- 1.9 MILLION
FOR THE FULL PACKAGE.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.631
- WELL, AS THE SAY,
"ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL."

00:31.664 --> 00:32.899
- NOW I'M IN
THE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.200
ALL RIGHT!
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:34.234 --> 00:35.402
ALL THE STUFF
IS STILL IN HERE.

00:35.435 --> 00:36.836
- WE'RE HAVING A LOT
OF ISSUES.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.837
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A LOT OF ISSUES?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.639
- OUR INTERIOR DESIGNER WALKED.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.840
- GET THE [bleep]
OUTTA HERE.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.475
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
CO-LISTING ANYTHING,

00:42.509 --> 00:44.678
AND THEN JILL,
INSTEAD OF HELPING,

00:44.711 --> 00:46.680
IS LOSING HER MIND.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.947
$15 MILLION PENTHOUSE.

00:47.981 --> 00:51.351
THIS IS GONNA MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE A TOTAL AMATEUR.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.554
[upbeat music]

00:54.587 --> 00:56.056
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:56.089 --> 00:59.926
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:59.959 --> 01:03.063
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

01:03.063 --> 01:04.898
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:04.931 --> 01:07.500
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

01:07.534 --> 01:10.070
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.404
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

01:11.438 --> 01:12.839
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

01:12.872 --> 01:15.241
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:15.275 --> 01:16.509
- IT'S OVER!

01:16.543 --> 01:18.578
* *

01:26.720 --> 01:28.722
- I THINK THESE ARE THE MOST
IMPORTANT THINGS RIGHT NOW.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.190
- THIS IS FOR THE CEREMONY.
- YEAH.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.158
WE NEED A SHIRT FOR THIS.
WE DON'T HAVE A SHIRT.

01:32.192 --> 01:33.827
- WE'RE JUST A FEW DAYS AWAY
FROM GETTING MARRIED

01:33.860 --> 01:37.530
ON A REMOTE ISLAND
OFF THE KEYS IN FLORIDA,

01:37.564 --> 01:39.499
AND IT FEELS
REALLY EXCITING.

01:39.532 --> 01:42.102
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
WEAR NOTHING UNDERNEATH.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.269
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOKING
WHEN YOU SAID THAT.

01:43.303 --> 01:44.804
- WELL, IT'S A GAY WEDDING.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.106
IT'S, LIKE, WE'RE IN--
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S--

01:46.139 --> 01:47.307
WE'RE ON THE BEACH.
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.742
I DON'T WANT IT
TO LOOK LIKE A GAY WEDDING.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.343
YOU--ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?

01:50.377 --> 01:54.781
- LIKE, ACTUALLY
MARRYING DEREK.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.517
OOH.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.785
OKAY, WHATEVER IT IS,
WE GOTTA PACK

01:58.818 --> 02:01.354
'CAUSE I-I HAVE TO GO BACK TO--
TO MY MEETINGS.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.089
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,
GETTING MARRIED

02:03.123 --> 02:05.058
IS NOT THE ONLY THING
THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT.

02:05.091 --> 02:06.726
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY CURRENT PROJECT,

02:06.760 --> 02:08.294
250 BOWERY.

02:08.328 --> 02:11.831
250 BOWERY IS A 24-UNIT BUILDING
BLOCKS FROM SOHO.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.367
AFTER I SOLD A UNIT TO RYAN,
I SOLD FOUR MORE,

02:14.401 --> 02:17.971
BRINGING THE TOTAL UNITS SOLD
TO 13, OVER HALF SOLD.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.073
UNFORTUNATELY, ZACH,
THE DEVELOPER,

02:20.106 --> 02:23.309
IS A CLIENT WHO WANTS
EVERYTHING DONE IMMEDIATELY.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.778
- THERE'S A LOT
WE HAVEN'T DONE, FREDRIK.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.846
JUST, LIKE, THE VOWS.
WE DON'T HAVE THE VOWS.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.815
LIKE, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE SAYING TO EACH OTHER.

02:28.848 --> 02:31.217
WE'RE LEAVING THIS LAST-MINUTE,
AND IT'S, LIKE...

02:31.251 --> 02:32.452
[cell phone rings]
LET'S DO THE VOWS.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.887
LET'S SORT
THE SHIRTS OUT.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.289
LET'S GET...
[ringing continues]

02:36.322 --> 02:38.425
ANSWER IT IF YOU--
IT'S LIKE--

02:38.458 --> 02:41.928
I MEAN, I'M--
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.563
YEAH, THE PENTHOUSE CONTRACT
WENT OUT.

02:43.596 --> 02:45.098
OKAY, I GOTTA GO,
I HAVE SOMEBODY VERY ANGRY

02:45.098 --> 02:46.299
LOOKING AT ME RIGHT NOW.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.867
YES, BEFORE--
OKAY, BYE.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.502
[sighs]
OOH.

02:49.536 --> 02:52.739
- I'M FEELING
REALLY FRUSTRATED.

02:52.772 --> 02:55.108
- WHEN WE GET TO THE ISLAND,
EVERYTHING'LL BE FINE.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.477
WE'RE GONNA, LIKE,
BE REALLY RELAXED.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.080
TRUST ME, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

03:00.113 --> 03:03.049
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
COME HERE.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.818
both: MWAH.
- OKAY.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.186
I LOVE YOU.
LET'S FINISH THIS.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.655
FLORIDA, HERE WE COME.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.797
- [clicks tongue]

03:17.831 --> 03:20.300
- HELLO.
- I WAS ON TIME.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.068
I'M SORRY.
- YOU<i>ARE</i>ON TIME.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.237
- MY BOSS EDDIE
HAS ASKED ME TO CO-LIST

03:24.270 --> 03:26.072
WITH ANOTHER BROKER.
HER NAME IS JILL.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.540
- HOW IS EVERYTHING?
- GOOD, LET'S SIT.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.142
WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME.
- OKAY, GREAT.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.077
- EDDIE WANTED SOMEONE
WHO WAS EXPERIENCED

03:31.077 --> 03:32.078
TO HELP GUIDE HER.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.680
LITERALLY,
ALL I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO

03:33.713 --> 03:35.081
WAS JUST GET THE LISTING.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.082
[groans]

03:36.082 --> 03:37.417
BUT APPARENTLY,
SHE HAS NO IDEA

03:37.450 --> 03:38.551
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.154
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS?

03:41.187 --> 03:44.157
YOU TAKE CONTROL.
AND I DID IT.

03:44.190 --> 03:47.394
BASICALLY, I HAD TO TAKE OVER
ALL THE STAGING FOR THIS THING,

03:47.427 --> 03:51.998
BUT IT TURNED OUT
PHENOMENALLY

03:52.098 --> 03:53.900
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

03:53.933 --> 03:56.536
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

03:56.569 --> 03:57.971
- I FEEL OKAY.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.907
- DO YOU THINK
I FEEL OKAY?

04:00.940 --> 04:02.342
- I THINK
YOU'RE ALWAYS OKAY.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.710
- I'M NOT OKAY.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.146
I'M STRESSED THE [bleep] OUT
RIGHT NOW.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.048
- I'M SORRY.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.282
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES.

04:09.315 --> 04:10.817
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A FOOT RUB
WHILE WE TALK,

04:10.850 --> 04:12.819
'CAUSE YOU'RE
REALLY STRESSED.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.621
I WILL GIVE YOU A FOOT RUB.
YOU HAVE NICE SOCKS ON,

04:14.654 --> 04:18.591
SO I WON'T TOUCH
YOUR FEET.

04:18.625 --> 04:23.063
- UH, SO WE HAVE THE [bleep]
SHOW WITH THE CATERING,

04:23.063 --> 04:24.264
BUT IT'S OKAY,
SO I'M TAKING CARE OF IT.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.565
- OKAY.
- AND THAT'LL BE FINE.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.566
- WELL, THANK YOU.
- SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.834
YOU'RE WELCOME.
- THANK YOU.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.269
- AND THEN, WE HAVE
THE INVITES, RIGHT?

04:29.302 --> 04:31.137
WHAT IS THIS?

04:31.171 --> 04:33.540
- IT'S THE INVITE
FOR THE PARTY ON THURSDAY.

04:33.573 --> 04:34.874
- FOR THE BROKER PARTY?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.843
NO ONE'S GONNA COME TO IT.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.179
SO I THINK IT'S MY FAULT,
PROBABLY,

04:39.212 --> 04:40.814
THAT I DIDN'T LOOK
AT THE INVITES WELL ENOUGH.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.082
BUT THEY--THEY LOOK LIKE
THEY WERE DONE

04:42.082 --> 04:44.784
BY, LIKE,
A THIRD GRADER.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.386
I CAN'T DO
A WHOLE NEW INVITATION.

04:46.419 --> 04:47.921
PEOPLE WILL THINK
IT'S A NEW PARTY.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.389
SO WE NEED TO EMBRACE
THE ONE WE HAVE,

04:49.422 --> 04:51.691
AND WE NEED TO LOVE IT
IN ALL OF ITS TOTAL [bleep]NESS.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.226
- HOW MANY RSVPs
HAVE YOU GOTTEN?

04:53.259 --> 04:55.762
- HOW MANY RSVPs HAVE WE GOTTEN
FOR THIS BROKERS' OPEN HOUSE?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.097
- YEAH.
- I-I KNOW THE NUMBER.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.832
DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER?

04:58.865 --> 05:01.601
SEVEN.

05:01.634 --> 05:05.038
WE HAVE SEVEN, IN TOTAL,
FOR A BROKERS' OPEN PARTY

05:05.071 --> 05:07.640
THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO FILL
WITH AT LEAST 200.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.576
- MY EARS ARE TURNING RED.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.044
[laughs]

05:11.044 --> 05:12.278
OKAY, YOU
JUST REALLY SCARED ME.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.414
SEVEN PEOPLE?
SEVEN PEOPLE?

05:14.447 --> 05:15.882
- DO YOU NEED
AN ANTIHISTAMINE?

05:15.915 --> 05:17.183
- NO, I'M OKAY.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.852
- I DON'T THINK
TAKING THIS LISTING

05:18.885 --> 05:21.788
WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR ME,
MENTALLY.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.758
- DO I HAVE LIPSTICK
ON MY TEETH?

05:24.791 --> 05:27.660
- I THINK NOW I KNOW THAT JILL
IS A LITTLE BIT SCATTERED,

05:27.694 --> 05:29.896
AND I NO LONGER
THINK SHE'S HOT.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.298
I AM GOING TO PERSONALLY CALL
EVERY SINGLE BROKER

05:32.332 --> 05:33.366
AND CLIENT CONTACT THAT I HAVE.
- SO AM I.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.502
I'VE BEEN CALLING ALL DAY,
ALL DAY.

05:35.535 --> 05:36.736
- THAT'S FINE,
BUT THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN DONE

05:36.770 --> 05:37.737
A LONG TIME AGO.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.905
DEAL?
- DEAL.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.940
- OKAY.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.985
- I MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY
WHEN I WAS 18

05:52.085 --> 05:53.286
BECAUSE THIS CITY
IS WHERE I BELONG.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.888
IT'S FAST-PACED.
WHOO!

05:54.921 --> 05:56.389
IT'S EXCITING.
IT'S SEXY.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.625
THIS IS WHAT PUSHES ME,
CHALLENGES ME,

05:58.658 --> 06:00.927
AND MAKES ME COMFORTABLE
TO DO ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO

06:01.027 --> 06:02.095
BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY CITY

06:02.128 --> 06:03.463
WHERE YOU CAN MAKE
ANYTHING POSSIBLE.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.665
MR. WILSON.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.400
- HEY.
- THERE HE IS.

06:07.434 --> 06:11.604
[both speaking Spanish]

06:11.638 --> 06:12.772
GOOD, MAN.
- ALL RIGHT.

06:12.806 --> 06:13.940
- YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS TELL YOU
THE SAME THING.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.076
I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN
A MASSAGE IN MY LIFE.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.811
I DO SHOE SHINING.
- ALL RIGHT.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.347
[cell phone rings]

06:20.380 --> 06:22.482
MR. PENNER.
-<i>SENOR,</i>HOW ARE YOU?

06:22.515 --> 06:24.517
- GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

06:26.453 --> 06:28.455
YES.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.397
THE ONES
IN THE WEST VILLAGE?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.233
RICHARD MEIER
IS ONE OF THE MOST

06:40.266 --> 06:41.735
FAMOUS ARCHITECTS
IN THE WORLD.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.136
HE'S CONSIDERED
A "STARCHITECT."

06:43.169 --> 06:44.671
A STARCHITECT
IS AN ARCHITECT

06:44.704 --> 06:45.972
THAT HAS REACHED
STAR LEVEL.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.174
FOR ME TO PUT MY NAME
ON ONE OF THOSE SALES,

06:48.208 --> 06:50.377
IT'S AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.911
I LOVE THAT BUILDING,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.513
IT'S OUR FIRST TIME
TO GET TO WORK TOGETHER,

06:53.546 --> 06:54.581
AND I'D LOVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.217
SO LET'S MAKE
SOMETHING HAPPEN.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.918
ALL RIGHT.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.488
BOOM.
MAN, THIS IS GOLD.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.523
[laughs]
- ALL RIGHT.

07:09.696 --> 07:13.033
- I'M GETTING MARRIED!

07:13.033 --> 07:14.868
WHOO!

07:14.901 --> 07:17.103
WHEE!
[laughs]

07:17.137 --> 07:18.138
IT'S WEDDING TIME.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.407
[cheering]

07:20.440 --> 07:23.176
EIGHT MONTHS OF PLANNING,
AND IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.511
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.312
BABE, IS THAT THE ISLAND?
- THAT'S IT.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.847
YES.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.250
- FOR MY WEDDING,
I'M GOING BIG.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.086
AND WHEN I SAY BIG,
I MEAN HUGE.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.422
OH, MY GOD, IT'S SO GORGEOUS.
- WOW.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.457
- I RENTED AN ENTIRE ISLAND.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.626
NO, LIKE,
A ENTIRE ISLAND.

07:39.659 --> 07:40.827
THIS WHOLE THING IS OURS.

07:40.860 --> 07:44.397
ALL IN ALL, I'M SPENDING
AROUND $1/2 MILLION.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.832
HI.
- HELLO!

07:45.865 --> 07:48.435
- WE'RE HERE.
- HI, I'M BRENDA.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.070

07:53.807 --> 07:55.675
I'LL HAVE MEMORIES FOREVER.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.478

[bird calls]

08:13.893 --> 08:15.662
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
MY OWN EYES.

08:15.695 --> 08:18.131
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.067
PALM TREES,
SERENE WHITE BEACHES.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.470
THERE'S BEAUTIFUL BUNGALOWS
FOR ALL MY GUESTS.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.106
LITTLE BIRDS EVERYWHERE.
DEER.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.340
OH, MY GOD!

08:27.374 --> 08:29.676
I COULDN'T HAVE PICKED
A BETTER PLACE.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.878
IT IS GORGEOUS.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.780
I MEAN, THIS ISLAND
IS MAGICAL.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.582
WOODPECKER, WOODPECKER.
HERE IT IS.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.951
- CAN IT BE MORE EXCLUSIVE
AND PRIVATE THAN THIS?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.652
- HOLY MOLY.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.521
OH.
[sighs]

08:41.554 --> 08:43.556
- OH, WOW.
LOOK AT THAT.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.692
THIS IS AMAZING.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.894
- OH, MY GOD.
[laughs]

08:47.927 --> 08:49.362
- [laughs]
[cell phone beeps]

08:49.396 --> 08:50.797
OKAY, WHERE DO
WE START?

08:50.830 --> 08:53.900
WE HAVE A LOT TO DO
RIGHT NOW.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.571
- 126 EMAILS.
- [sighs]

08:58.605 --> 09:00.240
BABE, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.775
LET'S JUST AGREE
TO SOMETHING.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.209
[sighs]
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:03.243 --> 09:06.279
- UM, NO MORE PHONE.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.747
- NO PHONE
THE WHOLE WEEKEND?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.149
- 48 HOURS, NO PHONE.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.383
- I HAVE
SO MUCH STRESS, BABY.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.352
I HAVE ALL THESE--
THESE CONTRACTS FOR 250 BOWERY.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.154
ZACH IS ACTUALLY COMING.
YOU KNOW THAT.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.356
I WANNA IMPRESS HIM.
HE'S MY NUMBER ONE CLIENT.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.025
- THIS IS OUR WEDDING.
- BABE, THEY'RE BIG DEALS.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.293
- THEY'RE DEALS,
THEY'RE DEALS.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.929
THIS IS OUR WEDDING.

09:23.029 --> 09:26.199
PLEASE?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.034
I DON'T WANT THESE DEALS
COMING IN BETWEEN OUR MARRIAGE.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.035
- OKAY, OKAY.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.437
I'M SUPER EXCITED
TO BE HERE,

09:30.470 --> 09:33.506
BUT I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SELLING OUT A BUILDING

09:33.540 --> 09:34.708
IN NEW YORK CITY.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.509
- WHY DON'T WE BOOK MASSAGES?
- [sighs]

09:36.543 --> 09:38.111
I COULD USE IT THOUGH.
ALL THAT STRESS,

09:38.144 --> 09:39.212
ALL THOSE CONTRACTS,

09:39.245 --> 09:41.047
AND ALL THOSE E-MAILS
I CAN'T ANSWER.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.416
I KNOW DEREK WANTS ME
TO PUT MY PHONE DOWN,

09:43.450 --> 09:47.554
WHICH, FOR ME,
IS NOT EASY.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.556
OKAY, LET'S GO.
- YOU READY?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.325
- IT'S FINALLY TIME
FOR THE OPEN HOUSE

09:52.359 --> 09:53.660
AT 250 EAST 49TH STREET,

09:53.693 --> 09:55.462
AND AS USUAL,
I CAN'T FIND JILL.

09:55.495 --> 09:56.696
BIG SURPRISE.
WHERE'S JILL?

09:56.730 --> 10:00.066
WHY ARE YOU AND I
THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE HERE?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.845
TO CHARLES STREET.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.813
165 CHARLES STREET
IS LOCATED

10:13.847 --> 10:15.115
RIGHT BY THE WATER
IN THE WEST VILLAGE,

10:15.148 --> 10:17.384
AND IT'S
A VERY PRESTIGIOUS LOCATION

10:17.417 --> 10:19.552
FOR HIGH-END,
HIGH-END CLIENTS

10:19.586 --> 10:21.121
DUE TO THE FACT
THAT IT'S VERY PRIVATE.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.122
- MR. PENNER.
THERE HE IS.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.490
- LUIS, MY FRIEND.
- HOW ARE YOU?

10:23.523 --> 10:25.058
GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUD.
EVERYTHING GOOD?

10:25.091 --> 10:26.826
- WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK?

10:26.860 --> 10:28.261
LET'S--LET'S GO
ON THROUGH HERE.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.264
[hip-hop music]

10:31.297 --> 10:37.437
* *

10:37.470 --> 10:40.607
- MY FIRST IMPRESSION
OF THE APARTMENT IS, "WOW."

10:40.640 --> 10:42.042
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALL,

10:42.075 --> 10:44.411
BUT THE WAY EVERYTHING
IS LAID OUT IN THIS APARTMENT,

10:44.444 --> 10:45.645
IT'S PERFECT.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.347
IT'S ELEGANT.
HOW MUCH IS THIS CHANDELIER?

10:47.380 --> 10:49.115
- 40.
- 40 GRAND?

10:49.149 --> 10:50.617
- YEP.
- JESUS [bleep].

10:50.650 --> 10:54.354
AND THEN, THE MOST
INCREDIBLE PART: THE VIEW.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.488
THIS IS AMAZING, MAN.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.091
NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY PEOPLE

10:58.124 --> 10:59.926
CELEBRATE THIS BUILDING
SO MUCH.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.461
YOU ARE PAYING
FOR ONE OF THE MOST

11:01.494 --> 11:03.563
PRESTIGIOUS ARCHITECTS
IN THE WORLD.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.933
- SO, AND THIS IS
THE MASTER CHAMBER.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.235
- BUT I WALK
INTO THE MASTER BEDROOM,

11:09.269 --> 11:11.871
AND THERE'S A PROBLEM.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.640
I WOULD NEVER WANNA
BE FACING A BRICK WALL,

11:13.673 --> 11:15.442
ESPECIALLY FROM
MY MASTER BEDROOM.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.543
- THIS IS AN OBSTACLE.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.878
THIS IS WHY
WE ARE HERE TODAY.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.314
- WE'LL FIND A CREATIVE WAY
TO MAKE IT WORK.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.982
SO HOW DO YOU WANNA
WORK THIS OUT?

11:23.083 --> 11:24.451
- SO HE--HERE'S
WHAT I'M THINKING,

11:24.484 --> 11:25.719
IS THAT, YOU KNOW,

11:25.752 --> 11:27.087
I'VE HAD THIS ON
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.755
THE OWNER MOVED BACK
TO CALIFORNIA.

11:28.788 --> 11:29.756
AND I'VE JUST BEEN SWAMPED

11:29.789 --> 11:31.224
WITH SOME OF THE STUFF
GOING ON.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.693
I NEED, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE
WHO'S GONNA HELP TO MOVE THIS.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.795
- HOW MUCH IS THE PRICE?
- 6.5.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.530
- I KNOW THAT $6.5 MILLION

11:37.564 --> 11:39.232
MAY SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,

11:39.265 --> 11:41.534
ESPECIALLY FOR
A 2,300-SQUARE FOOT APARTMENT.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.169
BUT THE APARTMENT
TWO FLOORS UP

11:43.203 --> 11:45.405
ALSO JUST TRADED
FOR 6.5 MILLION.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.540
SO PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND
RICHARD MEIER,

11:47.574 --> 11:48.775
UNDERSTAND THIS AREA,

11:48.808 --> 11:51.511
ARE ALL FOR SPENDING
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.380
- LET ME ASK YOU THIS:
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE SEEING

11:53.413 --> 11:55.715
THAT YOU THINK CAN HELP
TO TURN THIS AROUND

11:55.749 --> 11:57.283
AND SHOW
IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT?

11:57.317 --> 11:58.385
- I LIKE THE BUILDING.

11:58.418 --> 12:02.555
BUT I THINK AT 6,500,000,
I WOULD--

12:02.589 --> 12:04.324
I WOULD WANNA BE IMPRESSED
FOR MORE

12:04.357 --> 12:06.393
THAN JUST
THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.294
SO IT NEEDS DEFINITELY
SOME STAGING.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.496
THIS APARTMENT
HAS BEEN ON THE MARKET

12:09.529 --> 12:12.098
FOR A FEW MONTHS,
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.401
ONE THING I DID LEARN
FROM LISPENARD

12:14.434 --> 12:15.502
WAS THAT YOU NEED TO STAGE
AN APARTMENT

12:15.535 --> 12:16.870
TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S PRESENTABLE,

12:16.903 --> 12:18.905
THAT IT SHOWS WELL,
AND THAT IT LOOKS

12:18.938 --> 12:20.573
LIKE IT'S WORTH
WHAT I'M PRICING IT AT.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.342
- SO YOU FEEL
THAT THE BEST WAY

12:22.375 --> 12:23.843
TO REALLY START THIS OFF
IS TO REALLY STAGE THIS

12:23.877 --> 12:24.978
AND TURN THIS AROUND?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.846
- I THINK WE HAVE TO STAGE THIS.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.549
- BUT THAT MEANS
WHATEVER I SPEND, YOU SPEND.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.918
WE SPLIT.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.219
I WOULD LOVE TO WORK
WITH YOU, MAN,

12:33.253 --> 12:35.388
BUT IF I GO OUT
AND PICK THE RIGHT STAGER

12:35.422 --> 12:36.623
AND SERVE ALL
THE OPEN HOUSES,

12:36.656 --> 12:37.891
MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYBODY'S CATERED,

12:37.924 --> 12:39.092
EVERYBODY'S FOLLOWED UP,

12:39.125 --> 12:42.729
I THINK WE SHOULD
SPLIT IT 50/50.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.933
- IF WE'RE GONNA GO IN,
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS TOGETHER.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.435
WE'RE TALKING THE EXPENSES
AND THE INCOME

12:48.468 --> 12:49.436
THAT'S COMING THROUGH.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.604
WE'RE GOING IN
AS PARTNERS.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.006
- ALL RIGHT.
BOOM.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.241
I LOVE IT.
ALL RIGHT, COME HERE.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.810
[laughs]
ALL RIGHT.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.378
- LET'S DO SOME BUSINESS.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.512
- I KNOW THERE'S
SOME CHALLENGES,

12:59.546 --> 13:01.047
BUT IF THERE'S ANYBODY
IN THIS TOWN

13:01.081 --> 13:03.049
THAT CAN SELL THIS LISTING,
IT'S MYSELF--BOOM.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.719
- SEE, THIS IS
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.061
- OH, YEAH.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.230
[sighs]

13:17.263 --> 13:19.432
OOH.
OH, MY GOD.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.235
[sighs]
OH!

13:22.268 --> 13:25.171
THIS IS LIKE SEX...
- [chuckles]

13:25.205 --> 13:27.140
IT'S NOT AS GOOD
AS OUR SEX.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.442
- IS THERE ANYTHING,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

13:29.476 --> 13:32.712
THAT MAKES YOU NERVOUS
ABOUT THE "FOREVER" THING?

13:32.746 --> 13:34.681
I MEAN,
FOREVER IS A LONG TIME.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.484
LIKE, WHAT ABOUT MONOGAMY?

13:37.517 --> 13:38.852
- MONOGAMY?
- YEAH.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.221
I MEAN, LIKE--
- I BELIEVE IN MONOGAMY.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.224
- WHAT IF, LIKE,
I'M 92...

13:44.257 --> 13:46.159
- [laughs]
- AND BALD...

13:46.192 --> 13:48.194
- [laughs]
- IN DIAPERS?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.296
- YOU'RE EVERYTHING
THAT I WANT.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.332
I MEAN, I CANNOT THINK
ABOUT BEING WITH ANYONE ELSE

13:52.365 --> 13:55.935
OTHER THAN YOU
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.740
- WHOO.
MONOGAMY.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.510
GOOD THING IT'S DEREK.
[ding]

14:03.543 --> 14:06.880
[water running]

14:06.913 --> 14:09.215
AAH!
OH, MY GOD.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.884
AAH!
[sighs]

14:10.917 --> 14:12.052
IT'S TOO HOT.
BABE, IT'S--

14:12.052 --> 14:13.453
OOH, AH.
AH, AH, AH, AH.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.689
OH, OH.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.058
HELLO, CAN I HAVE
A TOWEL?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.368
- SO WE HAVE DRINKS OVER HERE.
THIS IS ALCOHOL.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.569
WE'LL DO WINE OVER HERE.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.804
- WHERE'S JILL?

14:30.837 --> 14:31.805
WHY ARE YOU AND I
THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE HERE?

14:31.838 --> 14:32.972
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:33.073 --> 14:33.973
- IT'S FINALLY TIME
FOR THE OPEN HOUSE

14:34.074 --> 14:35.141
AT 250 EAST 49TH STREET...

14:35.175 --> 14:36.242
[groans]

14:36.276 --> 14:39.079
AND AS USUAL,
I CAN'T FIND JILL.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.146
BIG SURPRISE.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.383
OKAY, WHAT TIME IS IT?

14:43.416 --> 14:44.751
WELCOME.
- HI.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.186
- HI.
YOUR MAKEUP LOOKS GREAT.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.387
- I HAVE TO GO CHANGE.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.722
- THERE'S ALREADY
PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.423
I GOT HERE AND THIS PLACE
WAS A TOTAL MESS.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.925
HI.
- OKAY, YEAH.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.562
WELCOME TO MY LIFE.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.831
- [groans]

14:57.864 --> 15:00.166
HEY, JILL?
- GIVE ME ONE SECOND!

15:00.200 --> 15:01.301
- SO THERE'S
100 PEOPLE OUTSIDE

15:01.334 --> 15:02.535
THAT THEY'RE NOT
LETTING UP--

15:02.569 --> 15:03.770
- ALL RIGHT,

15:03.803 --> 15:04.771
OKAY, I'M COMING--
WAIT RIGHT HERE FOR ME

15:04.804 --> 15:05.839
SO WE CAN WALK TOGETHER...

15:05.872 --> 15:07.073

I'M GONNA WAIT HERE.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.074
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE MY--
YOU'RE GONNA BE

15:08.108 --> 15:09.309
MY FAKE HUSBAND
TONIGHT, OKAY?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.777
- OH, SWEET.
I'M GONNA WAIT RIGHT HERE...

15:10.810 --> 15:14.247
- OKAY.
- JUST LIKE YOUR FAKE HUSBAND.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.551
[indistinct chatter]

15:18.585 --> 15:20.854
- TELL ME ABOUT THIS LISTING.
THIS PLACE LOOKS INCREDIBLE.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.056
- YEAH, IT'S INSANE.
IT'S 5,500 SQUARE FEET.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.692
A LITTLE OVER 1,100 SQUARE FEET
EXTERIOR SPACE.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.861
WE'VE LISTED IT FOR 14.9,
WHICH IS CHEAP.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.663
- NO WAY.
WOW.

15:30.697 --> 15:34.134
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE SKINNY.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.135
- SO THIS
IS THE FIRST BEDROOM.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.670
WE RESTAGED ALL THESE.

15:36.703 --> 15:37.971
WE TOTALLY DECKED IT OUT.

15:38.071 --> 15:38.972
I THINK
IT LOOKS GOOD.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.573
EVERY ROOM
HAS A MAJOR VIEW.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.875
- I DIDN'T TELL YOU,
BUT I'M GOING

15:41.908 --> 15:44.210
TO THE CAYMAN ISLANDS
NEXT THURSDAY FOR FIVE DAYS.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.245
- SO THIS IS THE WHOLE
MASTER BEDROOM SUITE,

15:45.278 --> 15:46.279
AS YOU CAN KINDA TELL.
- RIGHT.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.448
- SO IT'S
AN OPEN-CANVAS SPACE

15:48.481 --> 15:49.816
FOR YOU TO KINDA
PLAY AROUND WITH,

15:49.849 --> 15:51.217
BUT IT'S GOT
CRAZY OUTDOOR SPACE.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.218
- GREAT.
- YOU WANNA BUY IT?

15:52.252 --> 15:53.353
- ABSOLUTELY.
- LET'S DO IT.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.454

15:54.487 --> 15:55.455
- ALL RIGHT.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.556
I TAKE HARD CASH.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.992
[indistinct chatter]

15:59.092 --> 16:01.928
DESPITE EVERYTHING,
THIS OPEN HOUSE IS GOING GREAT,

16:02.028 --> 16:03.596
THANKS TO ME.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.031
- THIS IS AMAZING.
THIS IS GREAT.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.032
- SO BRING PEOPLE.
LET'S DO IT.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.233
- WE'LL HAVE TO.
- LET'S DO THIS.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.402
- I WILL.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.371
- OH, MY GOD.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.206
- OOH, AND I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE THAT JILL

16:13.239 --> 16:14.874
IS HAVING
SUCH A GOOD TIME.

16:14.908 --> 16:16.743
NOW I NEED TO TAKE A HOLD
OF THAT MOMENTUM

16:16.776 --> 16:18.411
AND SCHEDULE
AS MANY PRIVATE SHOWINGS

16:18.445 --> 16:19.813
OF THE PROPERTY
AS POSSIBLE.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.815
- WE'LL HAVE SOME BUYERS.
AND JUST MENTION MY NAME.

16:21.848 --> 16:22.816
- OKAY, WILL DO.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.552
- AWESOME.
- ALL RIGHT.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.297
- WHOO!

16:37.330 --> 16:39.566
- GESTURE.
GESTURE.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.901
NO, NO, THAT'S UGLY.
[laughs]

16:41.935 --> 16:43.603
- LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS IS.
- YEP.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.939
- IT'S EVERYTHING
THAT I COULD WISH FOR.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.841
- THIS IS THE BEST WEEKEND
OF MY LIFE.

16:47.874 --> 16:48.842
* BUH-DUH, BUH-DAH *

16:48.875 --> 16:49.876
TO CELEBRATE WITH DEREK

16:49.909 --> 16:51.277
AND THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE THE MOST

16:51.311 --> 16:53.513
IN THIS WORLD,
IT'S JUST PRICELESS TO ME.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.948
WHOO!

16:54.981 --> 16:57.751
I'M GETTING MARRIED!

17:01.021 --> 17:03.056
LET'S ORDER SOME FOOD!

17:03.089 --> 17:05.225
- SO THE WEDDING'S GONNA BE
DOWN AT THE BEACH?

17:05.258 --> 17:06.926
- YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE
RIGHT THERE.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.728
IN REAL ESTATE,
I DON'T TAKE A DAY OFF.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.164
MOST OF THE DAYS,
I DON'T EVEN TAKE AN HOUR OFF.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.266
I'M USUALLY SUCH A MACHINE.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.235
AND NOW, I'M FREE,
AND I-I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.302
I MEAN,
THIS "NO PHONE" THING

17:16.336 --> 17:19.939
IS ACTUALLY CRAZY...
IN A GOOD WAY.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.074
- DO YOU WANT KIDS NOW?

17:21.107 --> 17:22.642
OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT?
OR...

17:22.676 --> 17:24.711
- WE'VE BEEN TRYING,
BUT NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

17:24.744 --> 17:25.945
- BUT DO--
[laughter]

17:26.046 --> 17:27.714
- WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT
A LOT.

17:27.747 --> 17:28.715
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT
A LOT.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.951
- BUT--BUT IN WHICH WAY
WOULD YOU DO IT?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.553
- TELL THEM WHAT WE DID.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.589
- WHAT?
- THE GOOD NEWS.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.825
SO WE REGISTERED
FOR THIS SURROGACY.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.694
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- UH-HUH, YOU ARE?

17:40.727 --> 17:41.928
- IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.
- YEAH.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.963
- SO EXCITING.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.268
- THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE,

17:48.301 --> 17:50.070
AND THE DAY
AFTER TOMORROW,

17:50.070 --> 17:52.939
I GET MARRIED TO THE MAN
THAT I LOVE.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.610
- YOU SHOULD BE OVER THERE
WITH ME.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.945
EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.647
I FIND YOU HERE,
AND YOU'RE SITTING ON THE PHONE,

18:00.680 --> 18:01.781
AND I'VE ACTUALLY
HAD ENOUGH.

18:01.815 --> 18:03.883
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.685
[cries]

18:16.029 --> 18:17.297
- HI, ZACH!

18:17.330 --> 18:18.598
I INVITED ZACH
TO MY WEDDING

18:18.631 --> 18:20.667
BECAUSE WE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

18:20.700 --> 18:22.068
DOING ALL THESE DEALS
TOGETHER.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.203
HEY.
- HEY, FREDRIK.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.105
- WHAT A FRICKIN'
CRAZY BOAT.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.173
IT'S A HOUSE.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.742
[sighs]

18:28.775 --> 18:31.044
I COULD GET USED TO THIS.

18:31.044 --> 18:32.045
- THE ISLAND'S BEAUTIFUL.

18:32.045 --> 18:34.214
BUT LET'S TAKE
A COUPLE MINUTES

18:34.247 --> 18:35.448
AND TALK ABOUT WORK.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.816
- UM...

18:36.850 --> 18:39.519
- TALK TO ME ABOUT BOWERY.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.787
- WE'RE STILL
DOING WELL,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.922
13 CONTRACTS SIGNED
OUT OF THE 24,

18:42.956 --> 18:45.191
SO JUST HAD
OVER 50% SOLD.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.193
BUT IT'S GETTING
VERY DIFFICULT.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.629
- FOR WHAT REASON?
- PRICES.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.399
I MEAN, WE RAISED THE PRICES
SO AGGRESSIVELY.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.968
THE PENTHOUSES ARE ALMOST
3,000 A FOOT.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.870
THE MOST EXPENSIVE THING
EVER SOLD ON BOWERY

18:56.903 --> 18:58.338
WAS PROBABLY 1,100 A FOOT.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.206
- WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN LOWERING THE PRICES AT ALL.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.207
- I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK

19:01.241 --> 19:02.375
THAT IT'S EASY BREEZY,

19:02.409 --> 19:05.679
BECAUSE IT ISN'T.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.846
- YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T
BE TALKING TO YOU

19:06.880 --> 19:08.515
ABOUT WORK ON YOUR WEDDING
UNLESS I WAS,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.316
YOU KNOW, UNDER PRESSURE
FROM MY LENDERS.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.317
- I KNOW.
I KNOW THE PRESSURE.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.318
I KNOW, I KNOW.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.687
- I NEED TO GET
THIS BUILDING SOLD.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.821
- RIGHT.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.289
THIS IS
MY NUMBER ONE CLIENT.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.792
I KNOW HE HAS
A LOT MORE BUILDINGS COMING.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.394
IF I FAIL,
HE'LL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.797
- WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR MAKING IT HAPPEN?

19:23.830 --> 19:27.033
- WORKING HARDER.
WORKING EVEN [bleep]ING HARDER.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.735
IT'S MY WEDDING,
BUT I CAN GET IT DONE.

19:28.768 --> 19:32.105
IT'S JUST, UM...

19:32.138 --> 19:35.442
IT'S A LOT.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.477
I'LL GET IT DONE.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.751
- THIS IS ONE
OF THOSE APARTMENTS

19:44.784 --> 19:47.253
THAT IT IS A MUST
TO HAVE STAGED.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.222
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ARCHITECT
IS A GREAT ARCHITECT,

19:49.255 --> 19:51.057
BUT RIGHT NOW,
YOU HAVE TO GIVE A REASON

19:51.091 --> 19:53.059
TO PEOPLE WHY TO PAY
THIS MUCH MONEY

19:53.059 --> 19:54.527
FOR THIS GLASS BOX...

19:54.561 --> 19:55.895
AH, THERE SHE IS.

19:55.929 --> 19:58.798
SO I CONTACTED
THE MOST AMAZING

19:58.832 --> 20:00.967
INTERIOR DESIGNER
IN THE COUNTRY: ANGELA RICH.

20:01.001 --> 20:03.269
- I HAVE SEEN THIS ONE
ON THE WEBSITE.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.404
- BUT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME,
AND I'M

20:04.437 --> 20:06.339
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THIS APARTMENT.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.540
- I'M SURE YOUR MOTHER
THINKS SO.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.009
- MWAH. JESUS CHRIST,
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.543
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING
TO GET PEOPLE

20:10.577 --> 20:13.446
TO PAY $6.5 MILLION
FOR THIS LISTING.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.915
- YOU KNOW,
THE FURNITURE NEEDS TO BE

20:15.949 --> 20:17.417
SEXY BUT CONTEMPORARY.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.985
THE PERSON THAT BUYS
THIS APARTMENT

20:19.019 --> 20:20.854
WANTS<i>"CASA DE PENIS ERECTUS,"</i>
YOU KNOW?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.522
-<i>"PENIS ERECTUS?"</i>
I LOVE IT.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.391
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

20:24.424 --> 20:26.259
- YOU HAVE TO CREATE
THE WHOLE AMBIENCE

20:26.292 --> 20:28.828
OF LIVING HERE
IN A "RICHARD MEIER BUILDING,"

20:28.862 --> 20:29.996
WHO, OF COURSE,
I KNOW.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.398
AND...
- DO YOU KNOW HIM?

20:31.431 --> 20:33.166
- YES, I WENT OUT WITH HIM.
- REALLY?

20:33.199 --> 20:35.802
ON A DATE?
- HMM. YES, ON A DATE.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.504
- WAS IT GOOD?
- NO.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.406
- JESUS CHRIST.
- I'VE BEEN ON BETTER DATES.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.141
[both laugh]

20:41.174 --> 20:43.309
SO...TYPE OF DRY BAR
IN THE DINING ROOM.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.911
I MEAN, ONLY FAT AND UGLY PEOPLE
STAY IN

20:44.944 --> 20:46.079
IN NEW YORK
TO EAT AT NIGHT.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.048
- I COOK.
- OKAY.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.250
OVER HERE,
THIS TO ME IS SO BLANK.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.285
YOU NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE
COME IN HERE AND SAY,

20:52.318 --> 20:54.220
"YEAH, I WANT
SOME OF THOSE NUTS."

20:54.254 --> 20:55.221
NOT YOURS, HOPEFULLY.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.856
THIS CHANDELIER
LOOKS LIKE A HOOKER

20:56.890 --> 20:58.291
WHO GOT HER FIRST PAIR
OF EARRINGS.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.061
- WOW, FIRST OF ALL,
I HAVE NEVER MET SOMEONE

21:01.061 --> 21:03.063
IN MY LIFE WHO HAS
MORE ENERGY THAN I HAVE,

21:03.063 --> 21:04.664
AND SECOND, SOMEONE
THAT TALKS ABOUT SEX

21:04.698 --> 21:06.866
MORE THAN I EVER
EVEN CAN THINK ABOUT.

21:06.900 --> 21:07.867
BUT I LIKE THAT.

21:07.901 --> 21:10.804
SO THIS IS
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.439
- [sighs]
OH.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.973
I SEE.

21:14.074 --> 21:15.675
- CAN YOU MAKE IT
NOT A PROBLEM?

21:15.709 --> 21:17.711
- I COULD MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE A BETTER PROBLEM.

21:17.744 --> 21:18.745
- OKAY.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.081
NOW, YOU LOOK
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.283
- I AM.
ASK ANY OF MY EX-HUSBANDS.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.085
- JESUS CHRIST.
OKAY.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.219
- I AM EXPENSIVE.

21:26.252 --> 21:27.654
I MEAN,
I'LL WORK WITH YOU ON IT.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.089
I'LL SEND YOU SOME PRICING.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.758
I MEAN, THIS BE--
- BE GENTLE ON THE PRICING

21:31.791 --> 21:32.759
WITH THE PUERTO RICAN.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.795
- YOU CRACK ME UP, LUIS.

21:44.838 --> 21:46.106
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT WAS JUST ME,

21:46.106 --> 21:47.640
BUT FREDRIK JUST SEEMED
A LITTLE BIT STRESSED OUT

21:47.674 --> 21:49.275
EARLIER ON TODAY.
- YEAH.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.477
- I DON'T KNOW,
HE WAS--

21:50.510 --> 21:53.246
I MEAN,
I'VE HARDLY SEEN HIM TODAY.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.347
- THIS IS WHAT
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.116
BOWERY IS THE HOTTEST STREET
RIGHT NOW

21:56.116 --> 21:57.117
IN THE HOTTEST NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.019
THIS IS A GOLD MINE.
YEAH.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.887
YES, BUT BOWERY,
YOU HAVE A TAX ABATEMENT,

22:00.920 --> 22:02.722
SO YOU WILL
SAVE SOME MONEY THERE.

22:02.756 --> 22:03.923
[flutters lips]

22:03.957 --> 22:05.358
[indistinct chatter]

22:05.392 --> 22:07.527
- HEY, FREDRIK.
JOIN US, HAVE A DRINK.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.096
- NO, UM, MAYBE LATER.

22:10.130 --> 22:11.831
I GOTTA WORK.
SORRY, GUYS.

22:11.865 --> 22:14.167
I WOULD LOVE TO RELAX
ON THIS ISLAND

22:14.200 --> 22:15.568
AND ENJOY MY OWN WEDDING...

22:15.602 --> 22:17.671
WHAT?
YOU'RE BREAKING UP.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.072
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
RIGHT NOW.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.740
GETTING MARRIED OR NOT,
THIS BUILDING,

22:20.774 --> 22:22.175
RIGHT NOW,
RIGHT THIS SECOND,

22:22.208 --> 22:23.176
NEEDS MY ATTENTION.

22:23.209 --> 22:24.844
[blender whirs]

22:24.878 --> 22:26.312
UH, LOVE?

22:26.346 --> 22:28.682
CAN YOU--CAN YOU--
CAN YOU TURN IT OFF, PLEASE?

22:28.715 --> 22:29.683
I'M TRYING TO WORK.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.818
UM...

22:31.851 --> 22:35.121
- LET ME GIVE HIM A QUICK CALL,
JUST SEE WHERE HE IS.

22:35.155 --> 22:36.790
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

22:36.823 --> 22:40.093
IT IS SUPER SUCCESSFUL.
WE'RE SELLING LIKE HOT CAKES.

22:40.093 --> 22:42.128
- NOT EVEN RINGING.

22:42.162 --> 22:43.930
- JUST GET IT DONE,
PLEASE?

22:43.963 --> 22:46.733
- I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.601
- THIS IS--THIS IS WHY
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WALK AWAY

22:48.635 --> 22:51.604
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA--
YOU'RE GONNA R-REGRET THIS.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.573
- [sighs]

22:53.606 --> 22:55.675
- OKAY, G--

22:55.709 --> 22:58.478
OH, MY GOD.

23:02.115 --> 23:05.085
[indistinct chatter]

23:08.955 --> 23:10.690
- WELL, THANKS A LOT
FOR HAVING US.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.258
- OUR PLEASURE.
A PLEASURE, SO--

23:12.292 --> 23:13.927
- LISTEN TO ME,
THE INVENTORY--

23:13.960 --> 23:17.130
THE INVENTORY
IS AT A SEVEN-YEAR LOW.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.565
I FEEL GUILTY, YES.

23:18.598 --> 23:21.701
I CAN HEAR, LIKE,
MUSIC AND PEOPLE LAUGHING.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.603
- MWAH.
- HEY!

23:23.636 --> 23:25.839
- AND WHAT AM I DOING?

23:25.872 --> 23:26.840
I'M NOT WITH THEM.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.074
OKAY.

23:28.108 --> 23:30.610
I JUST--I-I CAN'T STOP.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.644
- WHERE IS FREDRIK?

23:31.678 --> 23:34.581
- HI, DO YOU WANT AN OLIVE?
YEAH?

23:34.614 --> 23:36.282
- WELL, THEN, YOU HAVE TO PAY
THE PRICE OF THE APARTMENT.

23:36.316 --> 23:39.986
IF YOU WANT IT,
YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.256
THAT'S WHY I'M SITTING HERE
IN THE FRICKIN' DARK

23:43.289 --> 23:46.159
TALKING TO YOU, BECAUSE IT'S--
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.360
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.
I GOTTA GO.

23:47.394 --> 23:50.397
I GOTTA GO.

23:51.464 --> 23:54.167
- BABE.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.773
SERIOUSLY, I'M SITTING THERE
WITH ALL OF OUR LOVED ONES,

23:59.806 --> 24:01.141
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN
WITH ME?

24:01.174 --> 24:03.576
YOU'RE ON THE PHONE
ABOUT YOUR DEVELOPMENT?

24:03.610 --> 24:06.046
WE AGREED, THIS--
IT'S THE ONE THING I ASKED FOR.

24:06.046 --> 24:07.047
- SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

24:07.080 --> 24:08.381
YOU WANT ME TO, LIKE,
QUIT MY JOB?

24:08.415 --> 24:10.517
- FREDRIK, YOU'VE ACTUALLY
MISSED THE WHOLE POINT.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.719
WE AGREED THAT YOU WOULDN'T
EVEN CHECK YOUR PHONE.

24:12.752 --> 24:13.720
AND I SAID--
- IT'S ONE NIGHT.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.121
IT'S A WHOLE WEEKEND.

24:15.155 --> 24:16.756
- FREDRIK, THIS IS WHY
I'M LOSING PATIENCE WITH YOU.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.058
- SHH. SHH!

24:18.058 --> 24:20.694
I TAKE MY JOB SUPER SERIOUSLY.
I HAVE TO.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.696
I'M THE TOP AGENT
IN NEW YORK CITY.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.130
I HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

24:24.164 --> 24:25.965
IF I DON'T,
WHO'S GONNA DO IT FOR ME?

24:26.066 --> 24:27.500
- YOU SHOULD BE OVER THERE
WITH ME.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.868
- THIS IS [bleep] RIDICULOUS.
- EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

24:28.902 --> 24:31.471
I FIND YOU HERE, AND YOU'RE
SITTING ON THE PHONE.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.773
- WHAT IS THIS?
- FREDRIK, NO, SERIOUSLY.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.408
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE ACTUALLY HAD ENOUGH.

24:35.442 --> 24:38.178
GIVE ME THAT PHONE.

24:38.211 --> 24:41.081
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOOK, LOOK.

24:41.081 --> 24:42.916
[phone splashes]
- OH, MY GOD.

24:42.949 --> 24:47.087
YOU HAVE L--HE'S F--
YOU HAVE [bleep]ING LOST IT.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.223
OH, MY GOD.
- MAKE SENSE, FREDRIK.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.424
- GO, GO--
- OUR FUTURE IS OVER THERE.

24:51.458 --> 24:52.792
IT'S NOT LYING HERE
ON A HAMMOCK

24:52.826 --> 24:56.329
TALKING PROPERTIES
AND SELLING [bleep].

24:56.363 --> 24:58.365
I'M SICK OF IT.

24:58.398 --> 25:01.401
- [sniffles]

25:08.241 --> 25:11.544
- SO THE ELEVATOR, RIGHT,
LANDS HERE ON FLOOR 24.

25:11.578 --> 25:14.080
AND THEN, YOU ALSO
HAVE FLOOR TWENTY--

25:14.114 --> 25:17.350
- OH, WOW.
- 25.

25:23.289 --> 25:26.059
WHAT...

25:26.092 --> 25:29.462
THE...

25:29.496 --> 25:33.233
WHERE DID ALL THESE BEDS
COME FROM?

25:33.266 --> 25:35.268
- THERE'S A LOT
OF BEDS HERE.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.237
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

25:37.270 --> 25:38.405
- COULD--COULD YOU--
COULD YOU GIVE--

25:38.438 --> 25:39.673
COULD YOU GIVE ME ONE SECOND?
- SURE.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.776
- JUST GONNA MAKE
A QUICK PHONE CALL.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.512
[line trilling]

25:45.545 --> 25:48.715
[sighs]

25:48.748 --> 25:50.383
[trilling continues]

25:50.417 --> 25:51.851
- YOUR CALL
HAS BEEN FORWARDED

25:51.885 --> 25:54.788
TO AN AUTOMATED
VOICE MESSAGING SYSTEM.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.623
- HEY, JILL.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.291
COULD YOU COME
TO THE PENTHOUSE, PLEASE,

25:58.324 --> 25:59.392
AT 49TH STREET?

25:59.426 --> 26:01.027
OKAY.
BUH-BYE.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.662
WE ARE CO-LISTING THIS.

26:02.696 --> 26:03.863
YOU CAN'T JUST COME IN
AND TURN IT

26:03.897 --> 26:05.665
INTO A BED WAREHOUSE.

26:05.699 --> 26:07.801
WHAT ARE ALL THESE MANNEQUINS
WEARING ROBES FOR?

26:07.834 --> 26:09.336
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[laughs]

26:09.369 --> 26:11.571
LIKE--LIKE SOMEONE'S PLAYING,
LIKE, A PRACTICAL JOKE ON ME.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.207
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE
THREE BEDROOMS DOWN HERE,

26:14.240 --> 26:17.811
AND THEN, YOU...

26:17.844 --> 26:19.946
UM...
- [chuckles]

26:20.046 --> 26:21.214
- YEAH, SO THEN,
THIS IS A BEDROOM AS WELL.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.382
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY BIG.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.517
YOU COULD FIT
TWO QUEEN-SIZE BEDS IN HERE.

26:24.551 --> 26:25.719
WORKS WELL.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.120
BAH!

26:27.153 --> 26:28.788
- I'D LOVE TO BRING
MY INVESTORS HERE

26:28.822 --> 26:32.092
AS LONG AS WE CAN PRESENT THIS
IN A MORE FORMAL FASHION.

26:32.125 --> 26:33.259
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU

26:33.293 --> 26:35.929
HOW BIG THIS SPACE
ACTUALLY IS.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.431
THE ONLY POSSIBLE REASON
THAT I CAN THINK

26:38.465 --> 26:40.500
THAT JILL WOULD NEED
TO PUT ALL OF THESE BEDS

26:40.533 --> 26:43.903
IN THIS APARTMENT
IS SHE'S OPENING A HOSTEL

26:43.937 --> 26:46.806
OR SHE IS A HOOKER.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.742
[door opens]

26:48.775 --> 26:50.210
- HELLO.

26:50.243 --> 26:54.314
HELLO.

26:54.347 --> 26:57.650
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WE RENTED IT OUT.

26:57.684 --> 26:58.818
- I JUST BROUGHT
A CLIENT THROUGH

26:58.852 --> 27:03.156
AND WALK INTO--TO--
TO A HOTEL BED HEAVEN.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.058
SO WHO'D YOU RENT IT TO?

27:05.091 --> 27:06.593
- THEY'RE A BEDDING
MANUFACTURER.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.761
- [laughs]

27:07.794 --> 27:09.129
WE JUST SPENT A MONTH
LISTING THIS PLACE

27:09.162 --> 27:10.163
AND GETTING IT PREPARED,

27:10.196 --> 27:11.164
AND BRINGING
ALL THE FURNITURE IN,

27:11.197 --> 27:12.432
AND THE STAGING,
AND THE ART.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.868
AND THEN, WE WALK IN
TO THE FIRST REAL BUYER WE HAVE

27:14.901 --> 27:17.303
AND THIS PLACE
IS A TOTAL [bleep]ING MESS.

27:17.337 --> 27:18.538
- THIS IS VERY ORDERED.

27:18.571 --> 27:19.639
I THINK
THAT IT'S VERY PRETTY.

27:19.673 --> 27:20.807
IT'S VERY COLORFUL.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.609
AND THEY PUT IN
THESE FANTASTIC TREES.

27:22.642 --> 27:23.810
- LOOK AT THOSE TREES.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.111
- WE HAVE TO LOOK
AT THE UPSIDE.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.847
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
WE HAVE TIME TO SELL IT...

27:27.881 --> 27:29.115
- OH, REALLY?
- AND WE'RE--

27:29.149 --> 27:30.450
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SELL IT.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.785
I ALREADY SPENT
A [bleep]LOAD OF TIME.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.453
- WE HAVE SOME RENTAL INCOME
COMING IN.

27:33.486 --> 27:36.289
- I COULD GIVE--I COULD GIVE--
HOW MANY BEDS ARE IN HERE?

27:36.322 --> 27:37.524
- 14.

27:37.557 --> 27:39.893
- I COULD GIVE 14 [bleep]S
ABOUT THE RENTAL INCOME.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.227
THE GOAL IS TO SELL THIS,
RIGHT?

27:41.261 --> 27:43.430
- THE GOAL IS TO SELL IT.
- IT IS A SALES LISTING.

27:43.463 --> 27:45.131
THIS IS NOT AN APARTMENT
I CAN SELL.

27:45.165 --> 27:46.833
I CAN'T SELL THIS.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.335
THIS IS
A LUXURY APARTMENT,

27:48.368 --> 27:50.937
NOT THE HOME FURNISHING SECTION
OF MACY'S.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.439
THEY SIGNED LEASES
ON THIS, RIGHT?

27:52.472 --> 27:54.674
- THEY DID SIGN A LEASE,
SO THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

27:54.708 --> 27:56.343
THEY DID SIGN A LEASE, SO--
- GREAT.

27:56.376 --> 27:58.211
THIS JUST IS NOT WORTH IT.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.747
IT IS NOT WORTH MY TIME.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.083
[sighs]

28:03.116 --> 28:06.853
I--THIS IS--THIS IS NOT
WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.222
I'M--I'M DONE.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.124
I QUIT.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.859
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.627
I'M OUT.
GOOD LUCK WITH THE LISTING.

28:14.661 --> 28:17.130
HAVE FUN RENTING IT, OKAY?

28:17.163 --> 28:20.166
THANKS.

28:21.634 --> 28:23.636
[opens door forcefully]

28:29.109 --> 28:32.045
[indistinct chatter]

28:40.653 --> 28:41.654
- WHERE'S FREDRIK?
THAT'S A--

28:41.688 --> 28:43.690
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.

28:45.225 --> 28:46.192
- [chuckles]

28:46.226 --> 28:48.061
- NO, IT'S WORSE
THAN THAT.

28:48.061 --> 28:50.630
HE'S GOT
A TELEPHONE ADDICTION.

28:54.968 --> 28:56.536
- PEOPLE ARE WAITING.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.837
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE HOST.

28:57.871 --> 28:59.372
- I HAD A FIGHT
WITH DEREK.

28:59.406 --> 29:02.709
- AW, COME ON.

29:04.444 --> 29:08.114
- HE WANTS ME TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN MY WORK AND HIM.

29:08.148 --> 29:10.316
IT'S, LIKE--
IT'S NOT FAIR OF HIM.

29:10.350 --> 29:12.018
HE WAS SO ANGRY.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.054
- YEAH, GOOD THING HE IS.

29:14.087 --> 29:16.022
HE SHOULD BE ANGRY.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.257
YOU SHOULD CARE MUCH MORE
ABOUT HIM

29:17.290 --> 29:18.825
AND LESS ABOUT YOUR WORK.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.427
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S--

29:20.460 --> 29:21.628
YOU SHOULD TAKE MY SIDE.

29:21.661 --> 29:22.662
YOU WORK ALL THE TIME.

29:22.696 --> 29:25.365
- BUT THIS IS
YOUR WEDDING NIGHT.

29:25.398 --> 29:26.666
- NO, TOMORROW
IS MY WEDDING NIGHT.

29:26.700 --> 29:29.569
- TOMORROW IS YOUR--BUT BUSINESS
CAN WAIT FOR 48 HOURS.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.705
SO THROW THE DAMN PHONE AWAY.
TURN IT OFF.

29:31.738 --> 29:33.340
- IT'S THROWN--HE THREW IT
IN THE--IN THE WATER.

29:33.373 --> 29:35.642
- HE DID?
GOOD THING.

29:35.675 --> 29:36.743
- OH, MY GOD.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.279
- LIFE IS ABOUT COMPROMISES.

29:39.312 --> 29:44.117
HE'S WORTH MORE THAN THAT.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.618
YES.

29:45.652 --> 29:48.455
AND YOU CAN TRY
TO GET THE DEAL DONE MONDAY.

29:48.488 --> 29:49.756
- BEING SINGLE
FOR SO LONG,

29:49.789 --> 29:51.691
I COULD WORK
WHENEVER I WANTED TO.

29:51.725 --> 29:53.326
IT ONLY BROUGHT ME
GOOD THINGS:

29:53.360 --> 29:57.964
ACCOLADES, MONEY,
RECORD PRICES.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.399
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME,
I THINK,

29:59.432 --> 30:04.004
THAT I'M REALIZING
IT'S COSTING ME SOMETHING.

30:04.037 --> 30:05.338
- DOING THE BIGGEST DEAL
OF YOUR LIFE:

30:05.372 --> 30:06.706
GETTING MARRIED.

30:06.740 --> 30:09.876
THAT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
THAN DAMN APARTMENTS.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.144
- YOU THINK HE'S GONNA
FORGIVE ME?

30:11.177 --> 30:14.481
- HE BETTER OR I'LL THROW HIM
IN THE WATER.

30:14.514 --> 30:16.583
- MY DAD,
HE HAS LIVED MY LIFE.

30:16.616 --> 30:18.318
HE'S DONE THE MISTAKES
I'M DOING RIGHT NOW,

30:18.351 --> 30:20.253
AND HE DOESN'T WANT ME TO DO
THE SAME MISTAKES.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.654
- COME ON.

30:21.688 --> 30:23.857
- I'M GETTING MARRIED
IN A FEW HOURS, TOMORROW,

30:23.890 --> 30:26.693
AND I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

30:26.726 --> 30:29.729
I NEED TO BE THERE.

30:31.498 --> 30:32.899
- NO.
[laughter]

30:32.932 --> 30:34.968
NO!

30:35.001 --> 30:36.136
[laughter]

30:36.169 --> 30:39.172
[giggles]

30:41.808 --> 30:45.045
- IF I WERE TO LOSE BOWERY,
IT'D BE TERRIBLE.

30:45.078 --> 30:47.781
BUT IF I LOST DEREK,

30:47.814 --> 30:49.482
I LOST EVERYTHING.

30:49.516 --> 30:50.650
I LOVE YOU.

30:50.684 --> 30:54.320
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.656
- WE NEED SOME HAPPINESS.
IT NEEDS TO BECOME A PARTY.

30:56.690 --> 30:57.857
- [chuckles]
- WHOO!

30:57.891 --> 31:02.529
MUSIC!
[cheers and applause]

31:02.562 --> 31:05.265
- I LOVE YOU.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.300
- WHOO!
[laughter]

31:08.735 --> 31:11.905
THE DAY HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.173
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

31:13.206 --> 31:17.210
- DEREK, DO YOU ACCEPT FREDRIK
AS YOUR HUSBAND?

31:25.385 --> 31:27.320
- OOH, LA, LA.
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

31:27.354 --> 31:29.389
- CHESS.
- OH, I'M GONNA KILL YOU GUYS.

31:29.422 --> 31:31.091
- ME AGAINST YOU.

31:31.091 --> 31:33.326
THIS GIVES A WHOLE
NEW DEFINITION TO "CHEST."

31:33.360 --> 31:34.728
- "CHEST."

31:34.761 --> 31:35.862
- I MEAN "CHESS."

31:35.895 --> 31:37.297
- THAT'S A REALLY BIG BALL,
FREDRIK.

31:37.330 --> 31:40.100
- OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.634
- SO IF I MOVE THIS ONE,
CAN I GO--

31:41.668 --> 31:43.470
- OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD.

31:43.503 --> 31:44.971
- MORE BRAINS,
LESS BOOB.

31:45.005 --> 31:46.239
BRING IT TO ME.
COME ON, COME ON.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.908
YOU'VE GOT THIS.

31:48.942 --> 31:50.310
- OH, [bleep].

31:50.343 --> 31:52.278
OH!
- WHOO!

31:52.312 --> 31:53.480
[laughter]

31:53.513 --> 31:55.582
- OKAY, I HAVE AN IDEA.
LET'S MAKE IT MORE FUN.

31:55.615 --> 31:57.851
THIS IS--
FOR EVERY PIECE OUT,

31:57.884 --> 31:58.952
LOSE ONE PIECE
OF CLOTHING.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.353
- OKAY, PERFECT.
WE'RE UP.

32:00.387 --> 32:02.555
- YEAH, BUT YOU--WAIT.
- [laughs]

32:02.589 --> 32:03.556
I HOPE YOU'RE WEARING BOXERS.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.892
- I'M NOT WEARING ANYTHING.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.127
- WHOO!
TAKE 'EM OFF!

32:07.160 --> 32:09.329
- WHOO!

32:09.362 --> 32:12.832
[cheering]

32:12.866 --> 32:15.168
[laughter]

32:15.201 --> 32:17.070
- HE HAS
GREAT TAN LINES.

32:29.816 --> 32:32.419
- AFTER MEETING ANGELA
FOR A CONSULTATION,

32:32.452 --> 32:34.554
I HAVE REALIZED
THAT SHE IS EXACTLY

32:34.587 --> 32:37.190
WHAT THIS APARTMENT NEEDED.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.692
SO SHE AND HER PARTNER,
GEORGE,

32:38.725 --> 32:40.126
HAVE BEEN WORKING
LIKE MANIACS

32:40.160 --> 32:41.594
TO GET
THIS APARTMENT STAGED.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.697
SO NOW, I'M HEADING TO SEE
THEIR MASTERPIECE,

32:43.730 --> 32:46.433
AND I AM HOPING
THAT IT'S AMAZING.

32:52.939 --> 32:54.541
HOLY [bleep].

32:54.574 --> 32:57.510
- MY LATIN WONDER.
- OH, MY GOD.

32:57.544 --> 32:59.746
<i>SENORITA,</i>HOW ARE YOU?
-<i>COMO ESTAS?</i>

32:59.779 --> 33:01.848
<i>MUY BIEN, TU?</i>
- YOU LOOK STUNNING, WONDERFUL.

33:01.881 --> 33:03.616
I'LL TELL YOU THAT
A THOUSAND TIMES, BUT JESUS!

33:03.650 --> 33:05.885
IT'S AMAZING,<i>SENOR!</i>
- YOU LOOK PRETTY GOOD YOURSELF.

33:05.919 --> 33:08.121
- HOW ARE YOU?
WOW, LOOK AT THIS.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.256
WOW, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

33:10.290 --> 33:13.460
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

33:17.297 --> 33:20.900
ANGELA RICH
TURNED A COMPLETE WHITE BOX

33:20.934 --> 33:23.703
INTO A GODDAMN SHOWROOM,
BUT A BEAUTIFUL ONE.

33:23.737 --> 33:26.606
THIS DEAD APARTMENT,
IT'S REBORN.

THIS IS AN APARTMENT

33:32.078 --> 33:33.947
LET ME TELL YOU,
I DID NOT EXPECT--

33:33.980 --> 33:35.882
I MEAN, I DID EXPECT IT,
BUT IN 48 HOURS--

33:35.915 --> 33:39.519
- WE EVEN ACTUALLY DID IT
IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS

33:39.552 --> 33:42.088
BECAUSE THE MOVERS WERE AMAZING
AND YOU WERE ALL AMAZING.

33:49.329 --> 33:51.231
YOU COULD DO SIT-UPS ON THEM,
NOT THAT YOU NEED THEM.

33:56.936 --> 33:58.204
- YOU DO.

33:58.238 --> 34:00.540
YOU CAN'T ROLL WITH THEM,
BUT YOU CAN SIT ON THEM.

34:00.573 --> 34:02.375
- AND THEN SOMEBODY CAN SIT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

34:02.409 --> 34:03.510
- WELL, THAT'S UP TO YOU,
DARLING.

34:03.543 --> 34:05.078
- BUT, I MEAN, LOOK AT THE--

34:05.111 --> 34:06.846

34:08.314 --> 34:10.383
- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
THAT CAN BE DONE IN THIS THING.

34:23.296 --> 34:25.865
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

34:28.568 --> 34:31.471
LOOKING AT THIS

THE CONGENIALITY OF THE ROOM.

34:34.641 --> 34:36.142
SO YOU DON'T NOTICE THAT
AS MUCH.

34:36.176 --> 34:38.144
