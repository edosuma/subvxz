00:20.895 --> 00:22.814
When you look
at Isaiah in relationship

00:22.814 --> 00:24.315
to the New Testament,

00:24.315 --> 00:26.026
you get whole
new interpretations of it,

00:26.026 --> 00:27.569
don't you?

00:28.153 --> 00:32.198
For example,
Jesus wasn't <i>the</i> messiah.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.034
He was <i>a</i> messiah.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.910
He wasn't even the first,

00:35.910 --> 00:38.663
and sure as heck
won't be the last.

00:38.663 --> 00:41.207
Messiah comes
from the Hebrew <i>"Mashiach."</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:43.752
Who here knows
what that word means?

00:43.752 --> 00:45.587
"An anointed one."

00:46.796 --> 00:48.089
Good.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.384
And many were anointed.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.095
King David, Noah, Daniel.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.431
There are dozens of messiahs
in the Old Testament.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.725
But, but the word
means more than that.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.228
A messiah is
a savior, a liberator.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.355
"One lamb
you shall offer in the morning

01:04.355 --> 01:06.649
and the other lamb
you shall offer at twilight."

01:06.649 --> 01:07.817
Meaning...

01:09.611 --> 01:12.739
there are only two messiahs.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.742
Yashua, or Jesus the Christ,

01:15.742 --> 01:17.869
and the Lamb,

01:17.869 --> 01:19.746
who will open the scroll.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.665
<i>Exodus</i> 29:39.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.251
Two Messiahs...

01:25.251 --> 01:26.920
not dozens.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.382
So you think
the next time we see a messiah,

01:31.382 --> 01:33.551
it will be the second lamb
who will open up the seven seals

01:33.551 --> 01:35.261
and usher in
the end of the world?

01:35.261 --> 01:38.431
I guess that depends
on how you read <i>Revelation.</i>

01:39.808 --> 01:41.392
What's your name?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.977
Livingstone.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.313
Well, Livingstone,

01:45.313 --> 01:47.899
you're an obstinate
son-of-a-gun, ain't you?

01:47.899 --> 01:51.444
You have no idea.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.279
<i>You know,
it's rare I speak to someone</i>

01:53.279 --> 01:55.031
with such deep understanding
of scripture.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.910
I feel like I've learned more

01:58.910 --> 02:00.745
in the last two hours
with you than...

02:00.745 --> 02:03.748
in the last
two years at this college.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.960
Well...

02:08.169 --> 02:11.047
it seems to me like you know
what you need to do.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.550
And what's that?

02:13.550 --> 02:15.301
I got a place in Texas

02:15.301 --> 02:17.971
where there's
a whole group of us.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.223
We study scripture together,

02:20.223 --> 02:23.643
and we follow
the rules set out by the <i>Bible.</i>

02:23.643 --> 02:25.145
It's a pretty great life.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.439
You should join us.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.441
We could use someone like you,

02:30.441 --> 02:31.985
the mind of a theologian.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.530
To Texas?

02:37.657 --> 02:41.035
Sometimes...
God has bigger plans for us

02:41.035 --> 02:43.413
than we could
ever dream up ourselves.

02:45.039 --> 02:48.251
Tell you this,
just come for a visit.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.337
See if you believe God is there.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.680
After we were
forced out of Mount Carmel,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.265
we didn't know where to go.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.808
We were a lost tribe
like those mentioned

03:03.808 --> 03:07.061
in 2nd Kings,
being tested by God.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.147
And then we found this place,

03:09.147 --> 03:11.691
a place to heal and rebuild.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.401
We call it New Palestine.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.364
This is right here is where
we have our church services.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.201
Nothing too fancy,
but we get by.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.872
Uh, you're living
in a real Christian commune,

03:25.872 --> 03:27.373
like the <i>Bible</i> teaches.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.710
Is this Livingstone?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.546
Welcome! Uh.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.384
Vernon says
you are the smartest man

03:38.384 --> 03:39.844
he's ever met.

03:39.844 --> 03:43.223
Oh, I've spent
a lot of years studying.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
- You're Australian?
- I am.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.936
Yeah, we've got people here
from all over the world.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.313
People like you who
have been called to this place.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.567
So, uh, good news,

03:54.567 --> 03:56.778
Lois rang this morning.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.073
She's accepted your invitation
to Passover dinner.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.658
Really?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.743
Maybe she's ready
to bury the hatchet.

04:04.702 --> 04:05.912
Well, that's good.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.581
That's really good.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.918
You're in luck.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.795
Came here in an exciting time.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.049
Welcome to the Promised Land, Livingstone.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.723
Get up.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.935
Why?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.436
You gotta be strip-searched

04:30.436 --> 04:32.105
before you can go exercise
in the yard,

04:32.105 --> 04:33.481
same as every day.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.694
Fine. I won't exercise, then.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.862
Well, that's not up to you.

04:39.862 --> 04:40.947
Get up.

04:46.494 --> 04:50.123
I said get up.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.877
And I said...

04:56.129 --> 04:57.797
I will not.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.973
theme music plays

06:02.487 --> 06:04.489
I met some oddballs in my time,
but none of them

06:04.489 --> 06:06.115
ever followed me
into the men's room before.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.867
Not unless you were paying them.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.036
The guy was kind of
making sense by the end though.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.829
What's this guy's name?

06:11.829 --> 06:15.666
Uh, the card said, uh, "Noh-vel"
or Novel, or I don't know.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.585
Gordon Novel?

06:17.585 --> 06:19.128
Oh, he's the real deal.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.005
Yeah, he's,
he's CIA from way back.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.091
- Bullshit.
- No, really.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.300
You know that photo
of J. Edgar Hoover

06:24.300 --> 06:25.718
wearing a lady's dress?

06:25.718 --> 06:28.513
- Novel leaked it.
- Stop.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.266
Hey.
Man's crazy, but he's connected.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.851
I wonder how he got it.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.520
Hot off the presses!

06:35.520 --> 06:36.854
Ah.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.064
Monday's discovery list.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.733
Oh, shit.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.361
What?

06:43.361 --> 06:45.488
Jamie Helliver.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.532
They're putting him
on the stand on Monday.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.535
Helliver is the ATF agent
who claims Livingstone Fagan

06:50.535 --> 06:54.330
shot him, our first eyewitness
to attempted murder.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.542
Says two white guys
and a Black guy shot him.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.585
Can't ID the white guys,
but what do you know,

06:59.585 --> 07:02.422
the one Black guy that survives,
that's the one who shot him.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.714
Tell me that's a coincidence.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.383
I won't,
but I will tell you

07:05.383 --> 07:07.593
we're not gonna win
painting the ATF as racist.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.345
- You don't know that.
- No, I do know that.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.097
You never win these things
from up on a soapbox.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.349
This can't be about race.
Not in Texas.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.685
No, we just need something
we can use

07:15.685 --> 07:17.645
to plant some shred of doubt

07:17.645 --> 07:19.522
in the jury's mind
and then move on.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.149
Take our lumps on this one.
That's it.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.567
Yeah.

07:22.567 --> 07:26.946
So, who's doing the cross?

07:26.946 --> 07:28.865
Helliver is going to ID
my client.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.284
- My client, my witness.
- It's just...

07:31.284 --> 07:34.245
you can get a little emotional
up there, Rocket.

07:35.246 --> 07:38.124
Look, y'all keep saying
we're a team, right?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.792
Well, that means
you guys gotta trust me.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.461
No, we do trust you.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.963
But maybe I can help you prep.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.631
All right?
Now, let me ask you something.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.717
What does Livingstone say
about Helliver's claims?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.302
Nothing.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.888
All he ever does
is quote <i>Bible</i> verses.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.556
Doesn't know
how to help himself.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.475
Well then, maybe we should head
down there tomorrow

07:55.475 --> 07:58.269
and have a little chat, see if
we can't shake something loose.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.729
We?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.986
Good morning, Livingstone.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.033
We need to talk
to you about what happened

08:12.033 --> 08:13.743
on the first day of the siege.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.412
I told you, I have no interest
in discussing that.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.248
You have no interest
in being acquitted?

08:19.248 --> 08:21.918
I won't be acquitted.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.503
How do you know?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.129
Because I've spent
the better part of my life

08:25.129 --> 08:26.506
studying the <i>Bible.</i>

08:26.506 --> 08:28.716
Never ends well for apostles.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.013
They're trying
to silence us

08:34.013 --> 08:36.182
because they know
we're speaking the truth.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.518
No, there's no conspiracy,
it's a Federal trial.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.977
There's always a gag order.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.521
Look, you need
to fight this thing

08:41.521 --> 08:42.897
in a courtroom
and not through theologians.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.482
I will not.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.650
So you're just gonna let them
run over you?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.318
They've already rolled over me!

08:47.318 --> 08:48.694
- Okay.
- You seem to be the only one

08:48.694 --> 08:49.820
who doesn't see that.

08:49.820 --> 08:50.905
I'm sorry.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.202
That's what they want. They...

08:56.202 --> 08:58.204
They want me to...

08:58.204 --> 08:59.747
fight back,

09:00.748 --> 09:03.292
so they can smile
as they watch me suffer.

09:04.794 --> 09:05.878
But...

09:07.755 --> 09:10.299
I will not give them
that satisfaction!

09:12.802 --> 09:15.930
They've killed
everyone I love,

09:15.930 --> 09:18.808
but I will never let them
see me suffer!

09:21.435 --> 09:22.645
Okay.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.023
Never.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.404
I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.115
I don't mean
to be obstinate, but...

09:34.115 --> 09:37.618
I don't have a lot of time.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.579
The Romans are coming.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.248
The Romans?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.042
St. Paul, who spread
the word of Christ,

09:45.042 --> 09:47.503
he was beheaded by the Romans.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.422
Okay. Well,
I feel like we're getting

09:49.422 --> 09:50.881
a little off topic here.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.842
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.012
Didn't St. Paul
ask for an appeal?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.513
- What?
- Yeah.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.724
You know,
after he was thrown in prison,

09:59.724 --> 10:01.726
he appealed
his case to the Caesar?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.561
You're a biblical scholar now?

10:03.561 --> 10:05.938
No, 12 years of Catholic school,
I hated every minute of it.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.940
So boring. No offense.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.775
What's your point?

10:09.775 --> 10:12.778
That even the Apostles
played the legal game

10:12.778 --> 10:14.447
when it suited them.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.950
Paul bought himself time.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.036
He preached
for another couple years,

10:20.036 --> 10:25.249
gained followers,
spread Christ's message.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.793
Look, Agent Helliver
is gonna get up there

10:27.793 --> 10:30.463
on Monday and tell the jury
you shot him.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.591
So we just need something
we can use

10:33.591 --> 10:35.968
- to argue that isn't true.
- It's not true.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.512
You didn't shoot anybody?

10:38.512 --> 10:39.847
I didn't say that.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.015
I'm saying that...

10:42.308 --> 10:44.769
Look, I didn't shoot him.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.813
Well, we can't
really say you were too busy

10:47.813 --> 10:49.315
shooting other people.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.942
Probably not a winning alibi.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.529
Can you provide us
with any more details?

10:55.529 --> 10:58.824
I don't know what, what,

10:58.824 --> 11:01.786
what else I can tell you. It...

11:01.786 --> 11:03.245
it was chaos.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.083
Well, Helliver says
he was on the north side

11:07.083 --> 11:09.335
when the firefight started.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.836
Says you shot him
within the first

11:10.836 --> 11:13.339
couple minutes
of the exchange.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.758
I was never
on the north side. I...

11:15.758 --> 11:17.176
When it started,

11:17.176 --> 11:18.469
I was on the opposite end
of the building.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.513
Peter had been shot and I...

11:22.932 --> 11:27.019
I was trying to help him

11:27.019 --> 11:28.604
away from the window...

11:30.356 --> 11:33.275
before I realized he was dead.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.988
You moved the body
by yourself?

11:37.988 --> 11:40.491
No. Clive helped me.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.911
You were with Clive
when Helliver was shot?

11:43.911 --> 11:45.579
My Clive? Clive Doyle?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.583
- Yeah.
- Well, hallelujah!

11:49.583 --> 11:51.460
We got ourselves an alibi.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.346
I don't even know
what you're looking for.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.390
Everything we have
on Elohim City.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.660
What about this?
Who's Richard Snell?

12:24.660 --> 12:27.580
- Do you know?
- Yeah. Why?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.750
It says here Pappy Millar
is his spiritual advisor,

12:30.750 --> 12:33.335
visits him in prison regularly.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.755
I do remember Snell.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.466
Bingo.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.804
- Huh.
- Huh.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.264
"Member of the Covenant,
the Sword,

12:45.264 --> 12:46.932
and the Arm of the Lord."

12:46.932 --> 12:48.601
He frequented Elohim City.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.145
Currently on death row
in Arkansas

12:51.145 --> 12:53.981
at Cummins Unit Prison
for killing a pawnshop owner

12:53.981 --> 12:55.441
he believed to be Jewish.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.068
- Spoiler, he wasn't.
- Hmm.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.904
He also killed a black cop.

12:59.904 --> 13:03.282
Who do we know
at Cummins Unit Prison?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.034
<i>What's this about?</i>

13:05.034 --> 13:07.161
We'd like to make a request
to sever my client,

13:07.161 --> 13:09.079
Livingstone Fagan's case
from the others.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.915
On what grounds?

13:10.915 --> 13:12.750
On the grounds
that my client has an alibi

13:12.750 --> 13:15.461
during the time Agent Helliver
claims Mr. Fagan shot him.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.962
Alibi?

13:16.962 --> 13:19.590
Yes, my client, uh,
Clive Doyle, Your Honor.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.383
I'm not
gonna waste the public's time

13:21.383 --> 13:24.804
and money
trying this case more than once.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.764
This is a conspiracy case.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.099
Defendants can't testify
on each other's behalf.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.810
- It's self-serving.
- Wait, wait, wait.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.561
What do you mean self-serving?

13:32.561 --> 13:34.146
Of course it's self-serving.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.815
Every person
I put up on the stand

13:35.815 --> 13:37.483
is self-serving for my case.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.567
- That's why they're up there!
- Okay. Okay.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.735
Your Honor, the--we, we--

13:39.735 --> 13:41.237
there is a legal precedent...

13:41.237 --> 13:43.447
I don't give a fig
about your precedent.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.282
I'm not going to let
his best buddy

13:45.282 --> 13:48.202
and co-defendant
give him an alibi.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.788
Motion denied.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.045
<i>Vernon, they're here!</i>

14:00.548 --> 14:02.383
They're here.

14:05.845 --> 14:10.516
Oh, so good to see you.

14:18.774 --> 14:19.817
Vernon.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.153
Come here.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.700
The story of Passover
tells us that the Israelites

14:27.700 --> 14:29.535
were enslaved to the Pharaoh.

14:30.578 --> 14:34.039
That Moses delivered them
from that slavery.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.875
But that the Jews
wandered the desert

14:35.875 --> 14:38.419
for 40 years before being
delivered to the Promised Land.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.340
And now all these years later,

14:43.340 --> 14:46.343
we find ourselves
like the Israelites,

14:46.343 --> 14:48.137
living in Biblical times.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.266
And like the Israelites, we also
find ourselves wandering,

14:54.184 --> 14:55.895
waiting for the Lord to tell us
how we can help

14:55.895 --> 14:58.397
deliver ourselves
and our families

14:58.397 --> 15:00.190
back to the Promised Land.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.152
Well...

15:03.152 --> 15:05.237
you won't have to wait
much longer.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.323
I've invited Vernon back to
Mount Carmel

15:07.323 --> 15:09.241
under my guidance.

15:09.658 --> 15:13.120
Well, Lois, that's mighty kind.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.459
I do want to return
to Mount Carmel.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.045
I really do.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.256
And one day I will.
God has promised me that.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.094
But not under
the rule of the Pharaoh.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.264
What are you talking about,
Vernon?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.682
Look what's happened
to Mount Carmel

15:33.682 --> 15:35.434
under your guidance.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.437
It's falling apart.
Does anybody look

15:38.437 --> 15:40.439
at Mount Carmel
right now and say, "Wow,

15:40.439 --> 15:42.524
God has blessed
this place"?

15:42.524 --> 15:45.444
Or do they look here,
in these woods,

15:45.444 --> 15:47.279
at these passionate believers,

15:47.279 --> 15:50.282
and see that this is where God
has chosen to stay?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.953
God has left you, Lois.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.871
And I can't bring Him
back to you.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.166
Look around,

16:00.459 --> 16:02.962
He's here with us,
just like He was with Moses.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.966
We will return
when the time is right,

16:08.258 --> 16:10.135
but not when you tell us.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.763
You bastard.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.473
I am the Lamb,

16:14.473 --> 16:16.809
the Lion
of the tribe of Judah,

16:16.809 --> 16:17.935
the root of David.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.271
No. No, you're not!

16:21.271 --> 16:22.481
You are the serpent!

16:27.194 --> 16:28.529
Come on.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.282
Ruth?

16:36.578 --> 16:39.331
I think I'm gonna stay here
for a bit.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.749
I'm sorry.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.171
dramatic music plays

16:59.476 --> 17:01.103
I'm starting to feel
like an idiot.

17:01.103 --> 17:04.565
The guy was supposed to be here
15 minutes ago.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.026
Are you sure he's legit?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.610
Legit?

17:08.610 --> 17:10.696
No, he's a maniac,
but we're desperate.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.001
Get in.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.003
rock music plays

17:26.003 --> 17:27.421
Shotgun.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.551
I don't think
I was being followed,

17:32.551 --> 17:34.386
but you can't be too careful.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.096
I didn't think
I was gonna hear from you.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.644
Yeah. Well, uh,
Gordon, things have changed.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.564
We're in a little bit of a bind
with some upcoming testimony.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.816
Whose? Agent Helliver's?

17:47.816 --> 17:49.860
Uh, yeah.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.570
Yeah. Looks like you were right

17:51.570 --> 17:53.405
about those front doors
being metal.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.699
Figured we could see
if we could get a little help.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.826
The door is just
the tip of the iceberg.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.329
There's a much bigger story
with Waco.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.789
Much bigger.

18:01.789 --> 18:02.790
Eyes on the road there, boss.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.626
Here. Look at this.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.253
Did you know that the Davidians,
that none of them

18:08.253 --> 18:12.132
had a proper autopsy
because the morgue lost power?

18:12.132 --> 18:13.550
Oh God.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.761
Or Jimmy Riddle?

18:15.761 --> 18:19.139
Dragged back into the fire
after he was shot,

18:19.139 --> 18:20.474
arm ripped off by a tank.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.267
Wonder who murdered him? Hmm?

18:22.267 --> 18:24.186
Gordon, let me ask you
a question.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.687
What's in this for you?

18:25.687 --> 18:28.065
Why are you so hell-bent
on digging up dirt?

18:28.065 --> 18:29.775
Because I hate the ATF

18:29.775 --> 18:31.527
with the fire
of a thousand suns, that's why.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.487
- I'm getting there myself.
- Yeah, but why?

18:33.487 --> 18:36.198
Because they arrested me
four times for fire-bombing

18:36.198 --> 18:38.242
the Federation
of Churches building

18:38.242 --> 18:39.993
in New Orleans, that's why.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.703
Which you didn't do?

18:41.703 --> 18:43.831
Oh, no, I did it,
but it was a misunderstanding.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.415
I just wanted to get
the World's Fair to New Orleans.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.626
Okay. Yeah. Pull over.
Pull the car over.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.299
No. Nuh-uh.

18:54.299 --> 18:58.220
Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, God. Get me out.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.814
I think it's best if we just
don't tell anybody about this.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.570
First one went in here,
the second here.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.614
You can see
where the bullets hit.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.950
And those holes
correspond to your wounds,

19:19.950 --> 19:21.118
as far as you can tell?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.953
The ones on my chest, yes.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.498
Uh, two other shots went
through my arm and my shoulder.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.250
The second was on its way out

19:28.250 --> 19:31.628
when it hit the back
of the vest, went into my chest.

19:36.049 --> 19:39.469
The vest appears
to be discolored.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.848
What is that discoloration?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.893
Blood.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.019
My blood.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.774
- Now, you've described...
- Hey. It's Novel.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.527
...what happened to you
in those first moments.

19:55.527 --> 19:59.281
Do you have any doubt
as to whether or not

19:59.281 --> 20:02.826
Defendant Fagan shot you?

20:02.826 --> 20:03.994
No.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.704
There's no doubt in my mind

20:06.705 --> 20:09.208
that man shot me.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.885
Gordon, we're in the middle
of a trial here.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.887
I did some digging
into Agent Helliver.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.138
Found something.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.226
What am I looking at here?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.977
This is the lineup card
that the Texas Rangers

20:28.977 --> 20:31.813
showed Helliver
when they asked him to ID Fagan.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.983
Read the notes in the margin.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.778
Is this real?

20:40.113 --> 20:41.782
Got it from a Texas Ranger.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.412
Crazy son of a bitch.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.081
How do we even know it's real?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.124
Hmm, fair question,
do we have anything to speak

20:51.124 --> 20:53.752
to the veracity
of this document?

20:53.752 --> 20:56.046
I have a signed affidavit
from a Texas Ranger

20:56.046 --> 20:57.339
saying it is.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.471
Hmm. Uh-hmm.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.728
I withdraw my objections.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.438
Great. Thanks, Bill.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.690
Admitted.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.778
Is this the circle you drew
around Livingstone Fagan

21:19.778 --> 21:22.906
to ID him
as the man who shot you?

21:22.906 --> 21:24.408
It is.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.285
When was
this interview?

21:26.576 --> 21:30.789
Um, believe it was
in the summer, June or July.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.959
So at least five months
after the siege.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.294
Yes.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.586
That's a long time.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.839
Hey, can you read
what the officer

21:38.839 --> 21:42.009
who took your statement wrote
in the margins here?

21:42.009 --> 21:46.346
"Unsure if ID
is from shootout or TV."

21:46.346 --> 21:50.183
So, you weren't actually sure

21:50.183 --> 21:53.395
that Livingstone Fagan
was the man who shot you.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.356
Well, um...

21:58.066 --> 22:00.110
the, uh, picture is blurry,

22:00.110 --> 22:02.029
that's why I was unsure.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.530
I know who shot me.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.666
How many Black people
lived at Mount Carmel?

22:14.666 --> 22:15.917
Do you know?

22:18.545 --> 22:19.671
No.

22:19.671 --> 22:23.258
Uh, White, Black, Hispanic,

22:23.258 --> 22:25.761
I just knew
that there were people there.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.471
You remember saying
that two White men

22:27.471 --> 22:29.181
and one Black man shot at you?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.099
Yes, shot at me.

22:31.099 --> 22:34.353
Livingstone was the only one
who actually hit me.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.647
But you never identified
the White men, did you?

22:37.647 --> 22:39.149
No.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.692
So the only person you ID'd
as a shooter

22:40.692 --> 22:44.404
happened to be
the only surviving Black guy?

22:44.905 --> 22:46.531
I guess so.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.325
And is it true
that your ATF Field Office

22:48.325 --> 22:50.869
has recently been sued
by its own Black agents

22:50.869 --> 22:53.538
for creating
an unsafe work environment?

22:53.538 --> 22:56.083
It was not unsafe.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.544
The Black agents were, uh,
offended by some jokes,

22:59.544 --> 23:01.505
- that's all.
- Right.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.590
Like the framed certificate
on the wall that said

23:03.590 --> 23:05.550
"Negro Hunting License"?

23:05.550 --> 23:07.928
Like that funny joke of yours,
you racist son of a bitch?

23:07.928 --> 23:10.097
- Objection!
- Watch yourself, counselor.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.723
I'm not a racist.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.643
And you can call me names
all you want,

23:14.643 --> 23:19.564
but I am standing here now,
by the grace of God,

23:19.564 --> 23:22.692
and I'm looking
at that man right now

23:22.692 --> 23:24.236
with my own eyes,

23:24.236 --> 23:26.488
and I am telling you,

23:26.488 --> 23:29.783
that's the man who shot me.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.792
<i>Why are you here, Fed?</i>

23:41.253 --> 23:43.171
<i>Well,
I, I'd like, if I could,</i>

23:43.171 --> 23:46.091
<i>to learn more
about Elohim City.</i>

23:46.091 --> 23:48.677
<i>Why would I
talk to you about anything?</i>

23:50.137 --> 23:54.266
You guys are putting me down
like a dog on April 19.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.479
Do you know that date?

24:00.856 --> 24:02.482
The significance?

24:04.651 --> 24:06.695
You should.

24:06.695 --> 24:10.907
It's the two-year anniversary
of the day you Feds

24:10.907 --> 24:14.161
burned 76 innocent women

24:14.161 --> 24:17.414
and children alive at Waco.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.623
Were you there?

24:20.292 --> 24:26.131
Oh, you were, weren't you?

24:26.131 --> 24:29.259
Do you hear their screams
when you sleep,

24:29.259 --> 24:32.471
the children, those babies?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.933
You know, Richard,

24:36.933 --> 24:40.812
not that I owe you
an explanation,

24:40.812 --> 24:44.149
but I'm gonna tell you
what the problem at Waco was.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.942
Okay?

24:45.942 --> 24:50.947
On one hand, we had a selfish,
narcissistic cult leader

24:50.947 --> 24:54.784
who wouldn't listen
to a goddamn thing anybody said.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.328
And on the other,

24:56.328 --> 24:58.663
we had some FBI leaders
who chose to take

24:58.663 --> 25:01.750
an unfortunately
aggressive approach.

25:01.750 --> 25:05.504
But there is plenty of blame
to go around.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.298
It wasn't all on us.

25:08.298 --> 25:13.303
Do you think they would've
just killed themselves

25:13.303 --> 25:16.014
if you didn't push them to it?

25:18.767 --> 25:20.560
Guard?

25:20.560 --> 25:23.688
I hope you still smell
their burning flesh.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.106
Guard?

25:25.106 --> 25:27.359
Because I sleep like a baby!

25:27.359 --> 25:31.655
And when April 19th rolls in,
and I have my last meal,

25:31.655 --> 25:35.534
I will imagine
the look on your ugly face

25:35.534 --> 25:40.372
as you realize who we are,
how we punch back!

25:53.176 --> 25:54.135
You all right?

25:54.135 --> 25:55.554
Yeah. Thanks.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.058
Why would he mention
his last meal?

26:00.058 --> 26:01.726
What's that?

26:01.726 --> 26:03.562
He said he'll be having
his last meal

26:03.562 --> 26:06.356
as we realize
how they punch back.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.440
Huh.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.526
Well, that's odd,

26:09.526 --> 26:13.280
seeing as he chose
not to have a meal.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.656
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.408
He said he didn't wanna eat,

26:16.408 --> 26:19.452
just wanted a TV
so he could watch the news.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.206
On April 19th.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.880
You gonna sulk
over here at the bar

26:30.880 --> 26:33.592
or are you gonna join us
at the big boys' table?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.760
They're all pissed at me.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.053
Yeah.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.556
Yeah, they'll get over it.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.600
We all make mistakes, Rocket.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.101
Hell, I flipped off the judge

26:43.101 --> 26:44.477
first day of the trial.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.856
I just wanted to help my client.

26:47.856 --> 26:51.610
And that's not a weakness,
that's your strength.

26:52.235 --> 26:55.113
You're all heart, Rocket.
Everybody knows it.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.365
That's a good thing.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.284
You'll find a way
to help Livingstone.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.454
Listen, on the plus side,

27:02.454 --> 27:06.750
looks like Novel might not
be completely full of shit.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.419
Are we gonna start looking
for Jimmy Hoffa now?

27:09.419 --> 27:11.755
The second shooter
on the grassy knoll?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.423
No, but maybe
we should start looking

27:13.423 --> 27:16.176
- for those goddamn doors.
- Hmm.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.014
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah...</i>

27:22.932 --> 27:24.851
Hi. Uh, I'm looking for a woman.

27:24.851 --> 27:28.188
- She's about, uh...
- Pig's in the mud

27:28.188 --> 27:29.773
<i>When he tires...</i>

27:29.773 --> 27:31.232
Oh, never mind.

27:31.232 --> 27:32.692
<i>Pig's in zen</i>

27:33.735 --> 27:35.320
<i>Pig's in zen</i>

27:36.154 --> 27:37.781
<i>Pig is nude...</i>

27:37.781 --> 27:39.949
- What do you want?
- <i>Unashamed...</i>

27:39.949 --> 27:41.826
You weren't easy to find.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.620
<i>Pig's in zen</i>

27:44.287 --> 27:45.872
<i>Pig's in zen</i>

27:45.872 --> 27:47.457
<i>I'm talking
about the pig...</i>

27:47.457 --> 27:50.043
Jesus, I told you, Gary,
just leave me alone.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.048
I wanted to give you
a second chance.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.177
Believe me, I could use
a second chance, too.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.684
Look, Carol, I don't think
you're a bad person. Okay?

28:05.684 --> 28:08.812
But you do know
some very bad people,

28:08.812 --> 28:12.273
and I'm afraid they're gonna do
something really stupid.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.777
Maybe on April 19th.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.696
And I need your help
to stop them,

28:17.696 --> 28:19.197
whatever they're up to.

28:24.452 --> 28:27.414
- April 19th?
- Yeah.

28:30.875 --> 28:34.170
Pappy Millar mentioned that date
last time I was at Elohim City.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.675
He said the revolution
would start by then.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.177
That date? You sure?

28:41.177 --> 28:44.389
It's my mom's birthday, Gary.
That's why I remembered it.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.893
Well, then you really
gotta help me.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.603
I don't gotta do shit.

28:53.773 --> 28:56.025
Look, if they do
something stupid,

28:56.025 --> 28:58.903
that sucks, okay, sure.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.197
But they're scary people.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.574
They're not messin'.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.328
And ain't none of this
is my problem.

29:07.328 --> 29:09.748
My whole modus operandi
is, like,

29:09.748 --> 29:11.499
not getting myself killed
for shit that isn't my problem

29:11.499 --> 29:12.917
in the first place.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.628
Especially not for the FBI!

29:15.628 --> 29:16.921
I mean, I hate the FBI,

29:16.921 --> 29:18.423
fucking bunch of baby killers.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.676
Right.

29:31.811 --> 29:34.397
Hey, just so you know...

29:35.774 --> 29:37.984
sometimes we pay informants.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.156
Like, what are we talking?

29:55.835 --> 29:58.922
tense music plays

30:23.822 --> 30:25.573
I really have to wear this?

30:25.573 --> 30:27.242
If you're buying drugs
with federal money,

30:27.242 --> 30:28.910
- you have to wear a wire.
- You don't need

30:28.910 --> 30:30.912
to overdo it in there.
If he asks a question

30:30.912 --> 30:34.457
or you do something that doesn't
feel right, don't push.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.501
Thanks for looking out
for me, daddy.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.628
No. I'm serious.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.297
If you overstep in there,
you make these guys suspicious,

30:41.297 --> 30:43.007
this whole thing is over.

30:43.007 --> 30:47.011
Gary, how many times
you bought drugs?

30:47.011 --> 30:49.013
- Zero.
- Then maybe relax

30:49.013 --> 30:50.723
with the advice, huh?

30:51.724 --> 30:53.977
Okay. Now, remember,
the objective is to get

30:53.977 --> 30:56.062
an invitation to Elohim City
on a later date.

30:56.062 --> 30:58.064
- You don't have to rush things.
- Okay.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.149
I get it. Just be cool.

31:00.149 --> 31:02.527
Jeez, can I just go in there
and buy some drugs already?

31:02.527 --> 31:04.028
I mean, shit.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.780
These people are dangerous,

31:05.780 --> 31:08.032
don't you ever forget that.

31:15.248 --> 31:18.459
You really think what
we're doing here is important?

31:18.459 --> 31:19.794
I do.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.466
Do me a favor,

31:25.466 --> 31:27.385
it's just in case.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.679
What's this?

31:29.679 --> 31:31.556
If anything happens to me,

31:31.556 --> 31:34.392
it's a letter for my daddy
explaining things a little.

31:37.395 --> 31:38.730
You're gonna be fine.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.097
Oh, hey, man.
Can I have a beer?

32:15.975 --> 32:17.894
Thank you.

32:17.894 --> 32:21.230
<i>I'm the man in the box</i>

32:25.109 --> 32:27.278
<i>Buried</i>

32:27.278 --> 32:30.615
<i>In my shit</i>

32:34.077 --> 32:38.247
- <i>Won't you...</i>
- All the way now. Come on, now.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.291
Yeah, good job.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.585
I'm sorry.
Let's rewind that.

32:42.585 --> 32:43.795
I'll take a drink to that.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.796
Hey, Becca.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.802
We met at Earl's, remember
through my boyfriend, Wild Bill?

32:53.304 --> 32:54.639
Carol.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.140
Sure. Yeah.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.642
It's, uh, shitty

32:57.642 --> 32:59.185
what happened with him
getting busted.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.646
Yeah. It's been tough.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.439
Hey, you--I'm gonna...

33:05.900 --> 33:07.860
Are you holding?

33:07.860 --> 33:10.863
Because I, I could really use
a pick-me-up.

33:10.863 --> 33:13.324
You a cop?

33:13.324 --> 33:14.993
Am I a cop?

33:14.993 --> 33:17.537
Jesus, look at me,
I'm too hot to be a cop.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.331
I'm actually a superspy.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.916
- Oh.
- Got my little own white van

33:21.916 --> 33:23.626
<i>outside full of FBI agents</i>

33:23.626 --> 33:26.504
<i>just waiting for me
to get my coke on.</i>

33:26.504 --> 33:28.631
- What the hell is she doing?
- I don't know.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.468
Okay. I-I remember you now.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.970
You're the crazy girl.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.472
How much you looking for?

33:36.472 --> 33:38.933
I don't know,
like 8 ball, maybe.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.185
120, but it's good.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.022
Okay.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.858
I'm good for that.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.907
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

33:54.907 --> 33:58.911
<i>Shove my nose
in shit...</i>

33:58.911 --> 34:00.663
What's going on here?

34:00.663 --> 34:02.415
- Quarters.
- Quarters.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.417
Can I play?

34:04.417 --> 34:06.294
By all means.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.503
Oh!

34:07.503 --> 34:09.047
That was so close.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.135
- Oh, shit!
- Oh!

34:14.135 --> 34:17.138
That's it. That's it.
All drink. All drink.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.599
Oh, shut up, Carol.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.976
- Are you enjoying this?
- No.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.811
Good, 'cause
this is just stupid.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.938
<i>Becca. Becca,</i>

34:25.938 --> 34:28.274
over here.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.735
All right.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.361
- Thank you.
- Tell Wild Bill,

34:32.361 --> 34:34.030
- I said, "What's up?"
- I will.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.699
Hey, um...

34:36.699 --> 34:39.911
you know the other thing that
sucks about the whole situation?

34:39.911 --> 34:43.748
I left a bunch of my shit
at his place at Elohim City.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.083
You know how crazy
they are about

34:45.083 --> 34:46.751
letting people in and all that?

34:46.751 --> 34:49.212
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. You got a trailer there,

34:49.212 --> 34:51.255
right? Right?

34:51.255 --> 34:54.342
So, you know, maybe
you could vouch for me?

34:54.342 --> 34:56.260
Just, just so
I could get in, you know.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.430
You know, like a woman
to woman kind of thing?

34:59.430 --> 35:02.975
- I don't know.
- Come on.

35:02.975 --> 35:05.478
I'm trying to avoid buying
a whole new wardrobe.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.943
Okay. Yeah. Maybe we can--

35:11.943 --> 35:13.694
I'm not paying you shit.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.530
I had to ask my uncle

35:15.530 --> 35:17.448
redo the cash out to this shop.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.617
That's bullshit.
Dude, no matter what,

35:19.617 --> 35:20.827
- you owe me.
- I'm not trying

35:20.827 --> 35:22.286
to Jew you out of nothing.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.080
- Now, get the fuck out!
- Get back!

35:24.080 --> 35:25.748
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, shit.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.792
- Put the gun away, man.
- Did she say, "gun"?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.752
<i>Stay calm.</i>

35:29.752 --> 35:31.754
Whoa. What happened to her mic?

35:31.754 --> 35:33.381
Dispatch, this is Agent Gram.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.969
Alert local authorities
that there's been gunfire.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.721
Come on,
let's blow this shithole.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.306
Come on.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.891
Keep going.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.981
Where is she going?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.399
What's happening?

36:02.076 --> 36:03.744
Shit.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.629
You heading out?

36:13.963 --> 36:18.968
Ah. I have to get back
to my family.

36:18.968 --> 36:22.722
Well, sure was hoping
you'd stay a little longer.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.018
What is it?

36:27.018 --> 36:29.312
I know what you meant
the other night,

36:29.312 --> 36:31.522
at Passover dinner.

36:33.274 --> 36:36.235
The Lamb, the Lion,

36:36.235 --> 36:37.904
the root of David.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.948
Saying you're a Messiah.

36:40.948 --> 36:43.201
You've been here
for a few weeks now.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.371
What do you think?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.877
I never asked for this.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.046
And I'll be honest,
sometimes it feels

36:55.046 --> 36:56.589
like a burden too great.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.634
But I have been chosen.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.679
And then I was led to you, Livingstone,

37:05.014 --> 37:06.849
because you've been chosen, too.

37:08.017 --> 37:10.144
You've read <i>Revelation.</i>

37:10.686 --> 37:13.231
You know how this old story
ends for me.

37:14.982 --> 37:18.444
God has chosen you to tell
my story when I'm gone.

37:18.444 --> 37:20.029
Why me?

37:21.280 --> 37:24.200
Nobody understands my teachings
like you do.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.080
Where is he?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.623
Where is that son of a bitch?

37:30.623 --> 37:32.959
Hey! What's going on?

37:34.210 --> 37:36.420
This is all your fault.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.297
- You killed her.
- What?

37:38.297 --> 37:39.715
- Killed who?
- Mama!

37:39.715 --> 37:43.469
She's dead.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.263
You are never
coming back to Mount Carmel!

37:45.263 --> 37:47.348
Never!

37:47.348 --> 37:50.142
You goddamn rapist!

37:54.480 --> 37:56.107
Are you okay?

37:59.068 --> 38:00.903
It's already begun.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.906
The forces of darkness trying
to snuff out the light.

38:03.906 --> 38:07.326
Livingstone,
God has asked you to stay

38:07.326 --> 38:09.453
and to fight for that light.

38:15.001 --> 38:17.586
David is Messiah.

38:17.586 --> 38:20.464
<i>The lamb "was slain</i>

38:20.464 --> 38:23.342
<i>and has redeemed us
to God by thy blood."</i>

38:23.342 --> 38:24.635
<i>He will come again</i>

38:24.969 --> 38:27.388
in Judgment...

38:27.388 --> 38:29.557
of the living and the dead.

38:29.557 --> 38:32.768
And his name is David Koresh!

38:33.853 --> 38:35.229
David Koresh.

38:35.229 --> 38:38.232
The name of the lamb
is David Koresh!

38:38.232 --> 38:40.026
When he returns,

38:40.026 --> 38:42.653
he'll bring the kingdom
of heaven to Earth!

38:43.904 --> 38:46.824
The seventh seal will open!

38:46.824 --> 38:49.452
He will slaughter
the Babylonians

38:49.452 --> 38:50.995
and the unbelievers,

38:50.995 --> 38:54.707
pulling down the curtain
on mankind!

38:54.707 --> 38:57.668
The end days are coming.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.879
We will all witness...

39:03.549 --> 39:06.218
She played you, Gary.
She's not gonna call.

39:06.218 --> 39:09.096
- It happens.
- No. She's not doing that.

39:09.096 --> 39:12.016
She's... she's trying.

39:13.434 --> 39:16.145
I know you wanna believe that,
but she's not.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.647
Look, she gave me this letter
in case something went wrong.

39:18.647 --> 39:22.526
Now, why on earth would she do
that if she wasn't serious?

39:22.526 --> 39:24.278
I don't know.

39:24.278 --> 39:27.323
Maybe you should give it a read,
see what she said.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.959
"Hi, Dad.
If you're reading this,

39:38.959 --> 39:41.003
then I'm probably dead.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.799
<i>But if that's true,</i>

39:44.799 --> 39:48.803
<i>it's only because
I was doing something right</i>

39:48.803 --> 39:50.429
<i>for once.</i>

39:52.431 --> 39:54.266
I know I've been
a real disappointment

39:54.266 --> 39:58.229
to you and mom,
but... if you're reading this,

39:58.229 --> 40:00.898
then at least
I died for something important.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.110
Love, Carol."

40:12.952 --> 40:15.704
What if in my blind drive
to make up for the fact

40:15.704 --> 40:18.707
that 76 people died
on my watch,

40:18.707 --> 40:21.085
I go out and get
another one killed?

40:23.921 --> 40:26.924
The people in Elohim City
are scary

40:26.924 --> 40:29.301
and this could go
very badly for her.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.599
I'm gonna go home
to my daughter.

40:35.599 --> 40:36.892
Uh-hmm.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.352
You heading out?

40:39.103 --> 40:40.438
No. I'm gonna stick around,

40:40.438 --> 40:42.481
see if she calls,

40:42.481 --> 40:43.899
if that's okay.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.027
Sure.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.662
<i>Hey, I, I know we were
just gonna pop in and out,</i>

40:56.662 --> 40:58.330
<i>but I kind of need
a place to crash,</i>

40:58.330 --> 40:59.915
so is there any chance

40:59.915 --> 41:01.959
I can stay with you
for a few nights?

41:01.959 --> 41:04.753
Shit. We ain't even there yet

41:04.753 --> 41:07.173
and you're trying
to burrow in like a tick.

41:07.173 --> 41:08.674
You got a crush on me
or something?

41:08.674 --> 41:10.134
No.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.136
- You ain't my type.
- Oh.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.138
I like assholes.

41:15.514 --> 41:17.141
Well, all right by me,

41:17.141 --> 41:18.976
but you'll have to ask
the big guy.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.665
I don't remember checkpoints

41:41.665 --> 41:43.167
last time I was here.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.710
Yeah.
They've been on high alert

41:44.710 --> 41:47.421
since your Wild Bill
and his boys went down.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.850
They have a second gate?

41:59.850 --> 42:03.354
Yeah. This is where
they, uh, search us.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.891
Who the hell are you?

42:40.891 --> 42:42.476
I'm, I'm with Becca.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.853
- I was--
- This is not what I asked.

42:44.853 --> 42:46.897
Who the hell are you?

42:48.607 --> 42:50.067
I'm Carol.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.944
She's Wild Bill's girl.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.704
Get out of the car.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.914
Why?

43:03.914 --> 43:06.458
So I can search you.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.796
Hands up.
You know the deal.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.773
Easy there, perv.

43:40.576 --> 43:43.621
You guys really know how
to make a girl feel welcome.

43:43.621 --> 43:47.625
We do what we can.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.126
Morning, Pappy.

43:49.126 --> 43:51.462
How's training going
with the new recruits?

43:51.462 --> 43:53.422
They'll get there.

43:53.422 --> 43:55.716
Uh, that's my friend Carol.

43:55.716 --> 43:58.594
She wants to see if
she can stay here for a bit,

43:58.594 --> 44:00.346
crash in my trailer.

44:02.056 --> 44:04.725
Nice to meet you, Pappy.

44:04.725 --> 44:06.852
You're Wild Bill's girl.

44:06.852 --> 44:08.062
That's right.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.813
Shame what happened to him.

44:09.813 --> 44:11.649
Yeah. It was messed up.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.984
Yeah. It's just strange,

44:13.984 --> 44:17.279
Wild Bill robbed 21 banks
without a hitch.

44:17.279 --> 44:19.657
And number 22, the cops were
right there waiting for him.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.951
One of his boys was probably
running his mouth.

44:22.951 --> 44:24.328
<i>Nein.</i>

44:24.328 --> 44:25.454
<i>Sitze.</i>

44:31.377 --> 44:33.462
My daddy raised Dobermans,
you know,

44:33.462 --> 44:36.924
beautiful dogs
just like these guys.

44:40.552 --> 44:42.680
Church is at noon.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.682
I wouldn't miss it, Pappy.

45:21.218 --> 45:25.556
theme music plays
