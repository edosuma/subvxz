00:00.960 --> 00:02.121
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.200 --> 00:04.680
Sean Renard. I'm Kenneth.

00:04.960 --> 00:08.806
I'm here for one reason, and that's to
get your child back for the family.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.369
And unless you
join forces with me,

00:12.440 --> 00:14.841
the King will mourn
the loss of another son.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.041
Juliette.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.360
I need to get
some of my stuff.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.768
What, so you're just
moving out?

00:20.960 --> 00:24.043
I need a place to stay with
somebody who understands me.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.361
What happened?
Juliette's a Hexenbiest.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.528
I want my life back!

00:30.600 --> 00:32.728
And if I don't get it...
You better watch out.

00:36.280 --> 00:41.286
"Ah! It was colder than ice; it
penetrated to his very heart."

01:18.960 --> 01:20.246
Where's Adalind?

01:23.320 --> 01:24.367
How'd you get in here?

01:24.480 --> 01:25.606
You gave me a key,
remember?

01:25.680 --> 01:26.886
I want it back.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.606
What happened to you?

01:33.160 --> 01:34.491
I met the new Prince
in town.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.684
Is Adalind with him?
Why?

01:37.120 --> 01:38.246
I'm gonna kill her.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.885
Good idea.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.166
She's at the Deluxe Hotel. Careful though.
Kenneth is not Viktor.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Apparently.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.889
What are you doing?
Finishing what we started.

01:58.880 --> 01:59.927
Does that hurt?

02:01.520 --> 02:02.521
Yeah.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.411
So Will this.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.920
Good.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.128
Ah, crap.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.921
Damn it!

03:05.080 --> 03:07.401
Have you tried
giving her a bit of honey?

03:07.480 --> 03:10.006
It'll soothe her throat
so she stops coughing.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.209
Mom, I am not
gonna give a 5-year-old

03:12.280 --> 03:13.960
a shot of honey
this late in the afternoon.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.490
She's supposed
to be taking a nap.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.884
Just try it.
It worked for you.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.850
Mmm, just a second,
somebody's at the door.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.962
Are you expecting anyone?
No.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.321
Well, don't just
open the door.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
I know.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.441
Sorry.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.810
My car broke down
on the road. I need help.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.163
I'm freezing.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.241
Who is it?

03:35.560 --> 03:38.643
There's a man at the door.
He says his car broke down.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.801
Can I use
your phone?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.565
Please, I'm so cold.

03:43.680 --> 03:44.761
Don't open the door, Mom.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.366
But his car broke down.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.644
Tell him that you'll call
a tow truck for him.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.008
Oh, my daughter says I should
call a tow truck for you.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.170
Open the damn door!

03:56.240 --> 03:57.241
Oh, my God!

03:57.320 --> 03:58.606
Mom, are you okay?

03:58.680 --> 04:01.206
He got very angry
when I told him what you said.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.521
Where is he?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.525
I think he's gone.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.651
Jenna, he's breaking
into the house!

04:09.720 --> 04:11.404
Mom, I'm calling 911.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.249
Get out of there right now.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.290
Mom, are you there?

04:19.680 --> 04:20.805
Mom?

04:23.440 --> 04:24.680
Mom!

04:26.440 --> 04:27.487
Mom!

04:28.360 --> 04:29.407
Mom!

04:31.080 --> 04:32.366
Mom, can you hear me?

04:35.080 --> 04:36.491
Mom, answer me!

04:38.240 --> 04:39.366
Mom!

04:41.960 --> 04:44.531
Mom, answer me! Mom!

05:12.240 --> 05:13.241
What do we got?

05:13.320 --> 05:15.163
Esther Blake,
71 years old,

05:15.240 --> 05:16.401
was on the phone
with her daughter

05:16.480 --> 05:18.528
when someone broke into the
house through the backdoor.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.250
No attempt to be quiet.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.520
Daughter heard
the whole thing.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.642
Called 911,
rushed right out here.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.091
So we've got
a home invasion.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.049
Yeah. Except the house
wasn't ransacked.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.167
Looked like
the only thing taken

05:28.240 --> 05:30.049
was the victim's vehicle,
a Toyota Corolla.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.565
We got a BOLO out on that.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.881
But that's not
the strange part.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.929
Which is?
The body.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.442
Is she frozen?
Solid.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.685
Doesn't feel
that cold in here.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.760
It's a balmy 72

05:45.800 --> 05:48.007
according to the thermostat,
which is working.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.242
It's definitely not cold
enough outside to do this.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.760
Body's still cold.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.524
You'd have to be exposed
to freezing temperatures

05:55.600 --> 05:57.045
for hours to do
something like this.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.043
Her daughter called
911 two hours ago.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.204
Looks like frostbite.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.884
You usually get
frostbite on your face,

06:03.960 --> 06:05.371
feet and fingers.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.920
Never seen it on
somebody's shoulders.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.486
That looks like a bite.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.843
So, I'm thinking
this is not the usual

06:14.920 --> 06:17.810
home invasion suspect
we're looking for.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.563
I think we'd better
talk to the daughter.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.484
Jenna Blake.
In the kitchen.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.890
Hi, Jenna.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.887
I'm Detective Burkhardt.
This is Detective Griffin.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.490
We are so sorry
for your loss.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.488
We need to ask you
a few questions.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.641
Was anyone else with your
mother when she was attacked?

06:45.600 --> 06:48.604
No. Um, my mom
lived by herself.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.560
My dad passed away
five years ago.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.760
I told her
to sell the house,

06:52.840 --> 06:54.729
it wasn't safe for her
to be by herself, but...

06:55.960 --> 06:58.327
But she was always
so independent

06:58.400 --> 07:00.448
You were on the phone with your
mother when the attack happened?

07:00.680 --> 07:03.684
Yes. God, it was awful.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.809
She said that there
was a man at the door.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.609
That she didn't know him.

07:08.680 --> 07:12.241
That he said his car broke
down, and that he needed help.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.288
I told her
not to let him in.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.604
But he broke into
the house.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.841
And...

07:18.520 --> 07:21.490
I told her to run,
to get away from him.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.170
She was so scared.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.889
I called 911 and...

07:29.680 --> 07:32.286
Why would someone
do this to her?

07:32.440 --> 07:34.204
Just to steal a car?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.648
How could
she die like this?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.563
If you can think
of anything else,

07:41.640 --> 07:42.971
please, give us a call.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.201
Okay.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.124
Well, if his car broke down,
he'd need a new one.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.281
He must've been in a hurry.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.885
Otherwise, why wouldn't
he get a tow truck?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.405
Maybe the car
was stolen.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.371
Either way, if his car broke
down, he had to walk.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.805
Then his car must
still be out there.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.248
Unless he was just using it as
an excuse to get into the house.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.527
Well, he still had to
come from somewhere.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.410
Unless he was an alien and his
spaceship is parked out back.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.566
You never know.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.241
Check state police,

08:10.320 --> 08:13.290
see if they've located any other
breakdowns within about five miles.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.566
You got it.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.081
Man.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.847
Wu, what have you got?

08:30.920 --> 08:33.001
The victim's vehicle was just
spotted leaving a gas station

08:33.080 --> 08:34.366
about 10 miles
from her house,

08:34.440 --> 08:35.851
traveling west
on Highway 2.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.206
Looks like
he stopped to refuel.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.885
Tell the officers not to move
in, suspect is dangerous.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.200
Have them set up a road block.
We'll intercept from here.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.049
Meet us there.
On my way.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.447
It's time.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.809
And without the shedding of
blood, there shall be no atonement.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.565
I love my wife,
and I always will.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.609
That's what real purity is.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.804
What's wrong?

09:28.120 --> 09:29.360
Sorry.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.040
What is it?

09:38.360 --> 09:40.249
It's just time.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.041
Time?

09:44.400 --> 09:45.526
Just...

09:47.600 --> 09:49.648
We never know
how much we're gonna have.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.081
Aw!

09:54.200 --> 09:55.361
Okay.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.451
Well, that's why
we have to make sure

09:58.520 --> 10:00.568
we never take
any of it for granted.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.201
Suspect's car pulled a U-turn.
We are in pursuit.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.361
That's him.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.000
Let's give him
something to think about.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.045
He thinks
he's getting past us.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.884
Stay with the car.
Yes, sir.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.361
He's that way.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.560
I don't hear him anymore.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.811
He must have stopped.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.006
Grimm!

13:06.080 --> 13:07.161
Stay down!

13:10.560 --> 13:12.369
Did you see him Woge?
Yeah.

13:12.760 --> 13:13.761
What is he?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.046
I have no idea.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.804
Don't let him
kill me.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.130
I'm cold.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.887
Once I found out it was
an early 1833 brass movement

13:26.000 --> 13:30.642
made by Chauncey Jerome, come on,
I mean, I had to take it on.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.087
I couldn't let anyone else
touch this one.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.523
Not least of which, due to
the fact that before 1830,

13:36.600 --> 13:39.444
almost all American shelf
clocks had wooden works

13:39.760 --> 13:41.205
because brass
was so expensive.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.203
So, you know,
this is a real find.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.241
Oh!

13:46.920 --> 13:49.366
That wooden works part really
got to you, didn't it?

13:52.360 --> 13:55.045
Why don't you tell me what
was really going on today

13:55.120 --> 13:56.406
when I came home?

14:00.360 --> 14:01.646
I was just
working on the clock,

14:01.720 --> 14:04.405
and I started
thinking about,

14:05.160 --> 14:09.085
you know, how much time this clock
had ticked its way through.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.886
I mean, the Civil War,

14:11.960 --> 14:14.611
and everything after that,

14:14.680 --> 14:16.011
and I thought

14:17.960 --> 14:21.248
how important time is, and
it just keeps ticking past.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.284
And that's why you Woged?

14:28.880 --> 14:31.486
No, I was thinking about
the whole Wesenrein deal.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.085
And how close our clock
came to stopping.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.201
You know? I mean,
we almost ran out of time.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.961
But We didn't.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.409
And we're rewound now.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.051
And we have
a whole lot more

14:53.160 --> 14:56.164
ticking and tocking to do.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.367
Wow.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.363
You really took
that clock metaphor

15:00.440 --> 15:01.805
and you ran with it.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.721
I love you.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.366
Knute Gunderson, 32 years
old, no criminal record.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.044
North Dakota
driver's license.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.167
Car registered
in his name,

15:14.240 --> 15:19.201
1997 Ford Explorer, registered
in Dickinson, North Dakota.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.123
Guy's a long way from home.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.441
I'll see if state police
have tagged his car yet.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.966
So, how does he
freeze his victims?

15:26.040 --> 15:28.520
It's gonna be hard
to charge him with that,

15:28.600 --> 15:30.090
but we've got him
for the stolen car,

15:30.160 --> 15:31.764
home invasion,
and assault.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.205
He's not going anywhere.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.040
I still want to know
what we're dealing with.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.891
Let's hit the books.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.122
Hey! Something happened
to our suspect.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.201
He's dead. Cold as ice.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.131
Looks like
he froze to death.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.850
How could that happen
in here?

15:59.920 --> 16:01.922
Well...

16:02.640 --> 16:04.688
State police just found
Knute Gunderson's car.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.206
Three miles south of
the victim's house.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.569
Can't wait to see
what the ME says.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.766
No.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.845
No, no, no. No!

17:02.920 --> 17:04.046
Three wounds.
Right upper, left lower.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.121
He's bleeding
like a sieve.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.201
I'm seeing
a liver laceration.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.724
A bullet has tumbled,
it's pressing on his spine.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.450
- He's asystolic.
- Clear.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.964
Both sockets flat.
We're losing him.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.288
So, Gunderson
ditches the car,

17:55.360 --> 17:57.328
starts walking,
finds the house.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.004
At least we know
where he is.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.003
Knute ate
a lot of fast food.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.923
It's a long drive
from North Dakota.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.809
Looks like
two of everything.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.763
Make that three. Got another
cup and wrappers back here.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.330
Got a receipt.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.882
Three combo meals, three buffalo
wings, three apple pies.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.050
Three bags in back.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.363
This all can't be Knute.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.842
You think there were
two more with him?

18:30.200 --> 18:32.601
Where'd they go?
They weren't with him.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.205
Maybe they had a fight.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.888
Knute could've killed them,
dumped the bodies.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.326
That'd be wishful thinking.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.721
'Cause if he didn't, there'd be
another two out there like him.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.723
Then we got a problem.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.289
Burkhardt must be communicating
with his mother somehow.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.283
Everyone says they don't
know where she is.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.521
Well, that's
probably true,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.523
but that doesn't mean
they're not communicating.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.568
And she does know
where he is.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.883
But if she thinks something's
wrong, she might come to him.

18:57.240 --> 19:00.005
She might very well.
He is her son.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.411
And she did come
to him for help

19:01.480 --> 19:02.840
when she had Adalind
and the child.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.291
I want to know how
they're communicating,

19:04.360 --> 19:06.601
whether it be
by phone, email

19:07.600 --> 19:09.011
or pigeon.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.048
I want his phones tapped
and his email hacked.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.167
Yes, sir.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.721
I have a problem.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.890
None of my clothes fit.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.883
Then you'll
have to go shopping.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.291
I'll send someone with you.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.600
I can do that myself.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.888
I'm sure you can,
but you're not going to.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.204
There are shops just around the corner.
I'll walk.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.930
This is not a discussion.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.445
Send someone with her.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.325
Hey, are you okay?

19:53.440 --> 19:56.410
Please, I need help. Oh,
my God, you're freezing.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.801
You must be suffering from hypothermia.
What happened?

19:58.880 --> 20:00.086
Car broke down.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.366
It's okay.
Come on.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.124
I'm a nurse.
I'll get you to a hospital.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.280
You're gonna be okay.
The hospital's not that far.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.322
Cold. So cold!

20:20.480 --> 20:22.448
What're you doing?
I need you.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.889
That's cute.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.160
You think that
would look good on me?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.566
How would you know?

21:47.520 --> 21:48.806
"As I
crossed the frozen tundra

21:48.880 --> 21:50.928
"With my guide, Akiak,
en route to Nordvagen,

21:51.320 --> 21:53.322
"he told me about the Wesen
I was looking for,

21:53.400 --> 21:54.925
"describing it as
a human-like creature

21:55.040 --> 21:57.441
"his people called
an 'Amarok, '

21:57.520 --> 21:59.249
"fur-covered,
whose breath he swore

21:59.320 --> 22:01.243
"could chill its victims
to death."

22:01.320 --> 22:04.290
The Wesen we dealt with
wasn't covered in fur.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.727
It had scales,
like a snake.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.802
Then this isn't it.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.769
I don't think
this is it either.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.082
A Fossegrim, lives in a
waterfall, plays the fiddle.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.568
I didn't see any
fiddle in his car.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.531
You know,
Monroe once mentioned

22:21.600 --> 22:25.400
a cold climate Wesen,
a Gefrierengeber.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.285
I don't think we're
looking for Santa.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.165
No.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.686
But maybe
he and Rosalee know

22:30.760 --> 22:32.250
what kind of Wesen
we're dealing with.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.367
Worth a try.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.520
We got two more
whatever-the-hell-they-are out there.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.283
Did you really order
six boxes of Syrian rue?

22:44.560 --> 22:46.688
I did. Not that I
know what that is.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.527
Oh, it's basically
a Banisteriopsis

22:49.600 --> 22:51.045
with the same
active alkaloids.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.884
It flies off the shelves.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.886
Well, you can't argue
with Banisteriopsis.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.729
As long as you can
pronounce it.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.484
Monroe, Rosalee!

23:01.560 --> 23:02.561
In here, Nick!

23:02.640 --> 23:04.642
What's up, guys?

23:04.720 --> 23:06.927
We got a Wesen-related case
we're working on.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.240
You guys busy?

23:09.640 --> 23:10.971
You're kidding, right?

23:11.920 --> 23:13.604
Couldn't find
anything in the books.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.167
It's some kind of Wesen
that freezes its victims.

23:16.680 --> 23:17.886
Freezes?
You mean like solid?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.411
Just like a TV dinner.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.484
That's a Varme...
Varme-something.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.800
Varme Tyv.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.245
That's the one.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.005
If I'm not mistaken, it's Norwegian
for "somebody who takes heat."

23:28.400 --> 23:30.368
"Heat Thief."
That's right.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.521
Was he a scaly fella?

23:31.600 --> 23:33.967
Yeah, and snaky.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.204
Mmm. That's a Varme Tyv.
Naturally cold-blooded.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.645
Winter is when
they're most dangerous.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.210
They can't generate
their own body heat.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.011
So, in order to survive, they have
to take it from other people.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.206
Otherwise they, like,
freeze to death.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.720
Why don't they just make their
way south for the winter?

23:47.480 --> 23:49.482
Doesn't really
work like that.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.843
A Varme Tyv's physiology can
only process human body heat.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.524
Other sources of heat
have no effect on them.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.960
These guys could freeze to death
sitting next to a campfire.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.685
Ordinarily,
they're harmless.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.600
They don't bother anybody unless they
get, like, caught out in the cold.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.001
Well, the one we found last
night had his car break down.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.605
He killed a woman,
froze her to death.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.963
Well, that must've
been why.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.121
I mean,
if his car broke down,

24:09.200 --> 24:10.804
then he'd have to
find heat or die.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.803
Her heat must not have
been enough for him.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.360
We locked him up last night, and
he froze to death in his cell.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.081
Ooh!

24:17.800 --> 24:19.768
That can't be easy
to explain, can it?

24:20.120 --> 24:21.760
We still think
there's two more out there.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.560
Must've been heading
to their hibernaculum.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.481
Hibernaculum?

24:26.120 --> 24:27.963
Every winter
Varme Tyv hibernate.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.690
They crawl into
an enclosed space,

24:29.760 --> 24:31.364
collectively sharing
their body heat.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.171
So they can survive through
the winter as a group.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.285
Sort of like a...

24:36.680 --> 24:39.001
It's like
an animal heat orgy.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.288
And where would
a hibernaculum be?

24:42.800 --> 24:44.848
Anywhere off the beaten path.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.401
Be right there!

24:47.840 --> 24:49.490
Hibernaculum is usually

24:49.560 --> 24:51.600
somewhere secluded where
they wouldn't be disturbed.

24:51.640 --> 24:52.720
Kind of like
bears in caves.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.720
We should go see who this is.
We'll be right back.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.491
Hey.

25:00.920 --> 25:01.967
What's wrong?

25:04.560 --> 25:05.686
Are you sick?

25:06.000 --> 25:10.961
It's the side effects of me becoming
Adalind and sleeping with Nick.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.080
What side effects?
What are you talking about?

25:16.920 --> 25:18.331
Juliette, talk to us.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.685
I'm...

25:21.760 --> 25:24.445
I'm losing myself.
I need help.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.046
Juliette.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.360
I didn't know
you were here.

25:36.480 --> 25:37.481
You told them?

25:38.560 --> 25:39.846
No, I didn't.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.805
You told Hank?

25:47.480 --> 25:49.482
Well, yeah,
he's my partner.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.645
So, what do you think, Hank?

25:53.280 --> 25:54.406
What is going on?

25:54.480 --> 25:56.289
Oh, my God,
did you guys break up?

25:56.600 --> 25:58.602
In a way.
Why?

25:58.920 --> 26:00.604
Can someone just tell us
what's happening right now?

26:00.680 --> 26:01.841
Tell them.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.650
If you don't, I will.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.644
All right.
Hold on to your hats.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.005
Oh, my God!

26:14.360 --> 26:15.407
It's the new me.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.845
There, it's done.
Are you happy?

26:24.200 --> 26:25.406
There's got to be
something...

26:25.520 --> 26:26.931
You always say that.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.446
This time you're wrong. There's
nothing anybody can do.

26:29.800 --> 26:30.926
When did this happen?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.802
Sometime after
we did what we did.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.125
I made a mistake
in coming here.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.766
I don't know
what I was thinking.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.321
You all had a hand in this.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.085
This is my fault, not theirs.
Don't blame them.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.289
There's enough blame
to go around.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.006
You can fix this, Nick.
Right? You can change this.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.482
Like when you
took Adalind's powers away.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.840
That's not gonna
work this time.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.245
How do you know?
I mean, are you sure?

27:06.320 --> 27:09.051
She met with a friend of
Renard's who knows about this.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.691
Juliette tried to undo it
before she told me. She can't.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.925
This is unbelievable.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.640
I mean, how are you two
still even living together?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.686
We're not.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.886
Oh.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.207
Okay, well, I'm sure
you both need time to...

27:23.280 --> 27:24.884
Time is not gonna
help this.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.922
She's a Hexenbiest,
I'm a Grimm.

27:31.920 --> 27:35.242
Wu, we're at the Spice Shop with
Monroe and Rosalee. You're on speaker.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.529
Hey, a woman was
attacked on the highway.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.524
She's okay, but the guy
who attacked her is not.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.524
Got ourselves
another frozen stiff.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.931
You got a location?

27:44.640 --> 27:47.041
Route four, mile marker 17.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.088
We're on our way.
Yeah.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.965
I should probably
go with you guys.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.326
Yeah.

27:52.920 --> 27:56.970
Nick, I'm gonna call Juliette.
We're not giving up.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.921
Thanks, Rosalee.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.607
on, my God.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.127
She's a freakin' Hexenbiest?

28:17.440 --> 28:18.805
Hey!

28:18.880 --> 28:20.530
Female driver
picked up a hitchhiker.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.284
He looked sick,
like he needed help.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.886
She was taking him to the
hospital when he attacked her.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.042
- Hey, Monroe.
- Sergeant.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.522
Monroe knows a thing or two
about the Varme Tyv.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.806
Varme Tyv?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.041
That what we're
dealing with here?

28:33.120 --> 28:34.167
Uh, we think.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.643
From what I know about Varme
Tyv, they need body heat.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.405
This is what happens
when they don't get it.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.130
They're really
cold-blooded.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.441
North Dakota license.
Just like Knute Gunderson.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.249
This is Jalmer Gunderson.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.521
I'm guessing brothers.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.681
Unless they're married.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.087
Whatever their relationship,

28:51.160 --> 28:52.844
Jalmer must've
gotten out of Knute's car

28:52.960 --> 28:54.564
after it broke down,
started hitchhiking.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.644
Well, this makes two. There's
still a third out there.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.483
If they need body heat so
bad, why would they split up?

29:01.880 --> 29:04.360
I guess three of them couldn't
generate enough heat outside.

29:04.440 --> 29:07.683
And one victim wouldn't
sustain all three, so...

29:07.760 --> 29:10.120
Plus no one's gonna pick up three
guys hitchhiking together.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.527
So, it's every
Varme Tyv for himself.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.120
All right, Wu,

29:14.160 --> 29:16.208
check out the police department
in Dickinson, North Dakota.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.282
See if any other Gundersons
are licensed there.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.528
We need to run
Gunderson here in Portland.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.840
If they're headed
for a hibernaculum,

29:21.920 --> 29:24.127
there might be
a relative here.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.480
Makes sense.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.768
It's Portland.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.891
Jeez, buddy, I didn't think
it was that cold out.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.450
Where you wanna go?

29:44.520 --> 29:45.601
Home.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.404
Gonna need an address.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.930
You sure you're okay?

29:55.200 --> 29:56.645
Hey, hey!

30:05.240 --> 30:08.801
Seven Gundersons in the Portland
area, from Beaverton to Troutdale.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.882
Any one of them could
be the hibernaculum.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.564
Then we'll have
to check them all.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.369
Not gonna believe this.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.330
We got another frozen body.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.525
Thank you.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.849
You think this guy's
the third Varme Tyv?

30:28.920 --> 30:30.046
Let's look.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.243
No, but he sure looks like he got his
heat stolen by one.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.247
"Mitchell Gareth." I have a
business card with his name on it.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.085
He was a cab driver
at Bridgetown Cab.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.684
Both the others
tried to steal cars.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.489
So, you think this
other guy stole a cab?

30:45.560 --> 30:47.244
One way to find out.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.686
Bridgetown Cab, this is Detective
Griffin with the Portland PD.

30:50.760 --> 30:54.924
I'm calling about one of your
drivers, Mitchell Gareth.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.483
Can you tell me
his last pickup?

31:01.040 --> 31:02.690
Last pickup was here.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.125
Thank you.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.402
Just got a call
from Dickinson PD.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.165
They have three Gundersons
licensed in North Dakota.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.891
Last known residence was a housing
compound for shale oil workers.

31:15.120 --> 31:18.886
Knute, Jalmer and Sven.
All brothers.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.205
Sven's the only one with a
record, all misdemeanor stuff.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.408
Charged for a couple
of drunk and disorderlies,

31:25.480 --> 31:26.527
spent a couple
of nights in jail.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.371
Booking sheet says he's got snake
tattoos up and down his forearms.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.771
Snakes, that's original.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.883
They all headed west
after their car broke down.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.770
Which of the Gundersons
lives out west?

31:34.840 --> 31:38.322
Well, of the seven addresses we
have, only one is west of here.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.764
A farm belonging to Sovnig
Gunderson, on Lost Mill Road.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.286
That's where we start.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.005
That was not an accident.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.440
What makes you think that?

31:49.560 --> 31:52.928
Because I saw her. I saw
Juliette across the street.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.525
She made it fall.
You're sure?

31:55.080 --> 31:57.003
Sure enough!

31:57.560 --> 31:59.005
You need to kill her,

31:59.360 --> 32:01.010
before she kills me!

32:01.280 --> 32:03.806
Don't be stupid.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.762
She helped Kelly Burkhardt
take your child.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.002
She might know how to get in
touch with Nick's mother.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.366
And now that
she's a Hexenbiest,

32:10.440 --> 32:11.521
there's no telling
how this has affected

32:11.600 --> 32:13.090
her relationship
with the Grimm.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.247
Can't imagine it's good,

32:14.520 --> 32:16.124
which is probably why
she's coming after you.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.043
She blames you
for what happened.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.323
This could well turn out
to our advantage.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.201
What, her killing me?

32:23.120 --> 32:26.647
Calm down.
No one's going to kill you

32:28.040 --> 32:29.451
unless you keep shouting.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.885
Lot Of cars.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.485
Maybe they're
having a party.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.925
That could be awkward.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.845
Pretty dark for a party,
don't you think?

32:57.920 --> 32:59.200
I don't see
the stolen cab.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.520
Well, if it's a party,
maybe he wasn't invited.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.483
We still need to check.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.244
If he's in there,
we're bringing him out.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.807
Right, but if this is the
hibernaculum, we got to be careful.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.524
There could be, like,
four or five of them in there.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.410
We can handle that. Only one
of them's guilty of murder.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.766
Hey.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.560
This way.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.202
Okay, it sure doesn't
look like anybody's home.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.280
I don't smell anything.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.209
Do you think we should knock?
Do you?

33:42.280 --> 33:43.400
He's still a murder suspect.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.283
I think the answer's no.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.845
Whoa, you feel that?

34:02.920 --> 34:04.570
It's like walking
into a freezer.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.041
Yeah, I've heard of winterizing a
place, but this is ridiculous.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.645
It's colder in here
than it is outside.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.290
I thought they were supposed
to be looking for warmth.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.402
Okay, if this is the hibernaculum,
where is everybody?

34:12.480 --> 34:14.402
Look, I've only heard stories
about hibernacula.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.643
I've never been inside one, okay?
So, don't ask me.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.370
Hey, wait, wait.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.565
You feel that?

34:21.639 --> 34:23.324
Yeah,
it's getting warmer.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.565
And warmer.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.362
Wait, I think the heat's
coming from the floor.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.288
Over here.
It's really warm over here.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.241
It's stuck.

34:46.199 --> 34:47.565
I got a trap door.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.125
Easy, easy.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.601
- Wow!
- Oh!

34:53.800 --> 34:55.848
That is really hot
down there.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.050
Wait a minute.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.363
If this is the hibernaculum,
what are they doing down there?

35:13.040 --> 35:15.361
Hibernaculating?

35:26.880 --> 35:28.882
It's like a sauna down here.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.603
What the hell is that?

35:49.800 --> 35:52.246
There's a lot more than
four or five down here.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.486
I think we found
the hibernaculum.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.410
Are you kidding?

36:11.280 --> 36:13.009
They're in
a deep sleep, right?

36:13.080 --> 36:14.764
Pretty deep,
as far as I know.

36:16.120 --> 36:18.566
We got to find Sven
and get out of here.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.640
You know how you're never
supposed to wake a sleeping bear?

36:24.240 --> 36:27.608
A pile of sleeping
Varme Tyv could be way worse.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.682
Then we better be careful
who we wake up.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.201
Hey.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.849
I think this is Sven.
He's got the tattoos.

36:48.120 --> 36:52.603
Yeah, but he's got two, make that
three, people on top of him.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.002
We just
got to be careful.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.645
Move slow.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.569
All right, get her,
and you get him.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.329
- Let me get her.
- I'll move his arm.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.721
Um...

37:08.800 --> 37:10.404
Guys, careful.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.802
Hey.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.970
Okay, get back, get back.
Come here. Come on.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.923
Uh... Okay, now what?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.840
I don't know,
there are too many of them.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.331
There's people down here.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.370
All right, everybody just stay calm.
We're the police.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.440
We're only here for Sven.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.680
All right,
get up, get up.

37:31.960 --> 37:32.961
Kill them!

37:33.040 --> 37:34.530
Go, go,
up the stairs, go!

37:34.640 --> 37:37.007
No one can know we're here.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.524
Come on, come on.
Come on.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.720
We got to rethink this.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.921
We're not gonna be able
to keep them down there.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.001
We have to get
back to the cars.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.161
We're just gonna
let them loose?

37:48.240 --> 37:49.287
I don't think we
have a choice now!

37:49.600 --> 37:50.840
Three, two, one, go!

37:57.920 --> 37:59.126
Hurry up!

37:59.200 --> 38:01.360
They went outside!
Don't let them get away!

38:07.840 --> 38:09.808
We'll never make it to the cars!
To the barn!

38:12.040 --> 38:13.041
Over here!

38:13.120 --> 38:14.360
It's cold out here.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.360
Don't worry about it.
Get them, get them!

38:16.520 --> 38:18.409
- Stop them!
- Faster!

38:20.360 --> 38:21.441
Oh, my God!

38:21.520 --> 38:22.720
Don't let them get away!

38:23.440 --> 38:25.283
Stop them before
they get there!

38:29.240 --> 38:30.321
There's the stolen cab.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.520
I'm calling for back-up!

38:35.560 --> 38:36.607
No, they'll never
get here on time!

38:36.680 --> 38:38.045
Hell of a lot of
them coming this way!

38:38.120 --> 38:39.167
Get the shovel!

38:43.240 --> 38:44.241
Everybody get ready.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.121
Get the door.
Yeah.

38:53.960 --> 38:54.961
Got it!

38:58.320 --> 38:59.367
They're in!

39:42.000 --> 39:43.729
So cold, so cold.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.484
Nick, Hank,
get over here.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.487
What's happening?

39:57.560 --> 39:58.686
They're freezing.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.250
How do we
explain this one?

40:00.480 --> 40:01.641
I don't think we can.

40:01.960 --> 40:02.961
So, what do we do?

40:04.240 --> 40:05.321
We got to put them back.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.047
All of them?

40:07.120 --> 40:09.122
They're innocent.
We can't just let them die.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.685
Okay.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.200
You think
they'll survive?

40:30.240 --> 40:31.685
I hope.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.363
Let's
get it closed back up.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.886
Quietly, quietly.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.561
We were never here.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.282
Ah. Probably better that way.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.611
Hey, wait a minute.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.560
What happened to Sven?

40:57.760 --> 40:59.444
Frozen solid in the barn.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.564
Yeah, he was
never here either.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.120
Otherwise they're gonna
find everyone else.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.727
So, what are we
gonna do with him?

41:12.040 --> 41:13.280
Taxi!

41:15.160 --> 41:17.288
Excuse me, are you on duty?

41:38.920 --> 41:40.490
The misfortune
of our family

41:40.600 --> 41:42.045
is already passing to you.

41:42.440 --> 41:43.965
I'm so sorry.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.765
I know you love Juliette,

41:46.640 --> 41:48.722
but you have to end it
and never see her again.
