WEBVTT

01:31.820 --> 01:34.513
I told you I was gonna do this.

01:34.513 --> 01:37.895
I wish you were here
with me, but...

01:39.552 --> 01:41.382
I'm gonna do this.

04:06.665 --> 04:09.564
Five. Moment of truth.

05:01.029 --> 05:04.895
Don't look. Don't look.

05:21.464 --> 05:24.121
Come on. Shut. Come on. Shut,
Come on! Shut!

05:42.070 --> 05:45.591
Okay. Back to one.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.847
Oh, God! It's going up!

06:06.060 --> 06:07.751
What?

06:11.099 --> 06:14.586
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on!

06:14.586 --> 06:17.209
Come on, come on!

06:17.209 --> 06:20.764
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

06:44.270 --> 06:45.858
Where are you going?

08:38.143 --> 08:41.042
Welcome to
"Nightmare on Dare Street."

08:41.042 --> 08:44.943
I'm your host, Kris Russo!

08:44.943 --> 08:48.256
And with me as always,
Chloe Young.

08:48.256 --> 08:50.983
M-M-M-Matty Davis!

08:50.983 --> 08:56.057
And Izzy Simpson!

08:56.057 --> 08:58.612
Izzy, we good? Cool!

08:58.612 --> 09:01.960
Chloe, want to tell the folks
at home all about today's game?

09:01.960 --> 09:04.065
Today, we're playing
Three Kings,

09:04.065 --> 09:05.929
which when played right
will allow us

09:05.929 --> 09:08.104
to talk to the spirit
of a dead king

09:08.104 --> 09:09.761
with the help of these mirrors.

09:09.761 --> 09:13.247
Uh-huh.
Talking to a dead king. Wow.

09:13.247 --> 09:15.801
Want to tell the folks at home
how we're gonna throw

09:15.801 --> 09:18.148
some spice on this bad boy?

09:18.148 --> 09:20.875
By playing in the abandoned
home of a serial killer,

09:20.875 --> 09:22.601
Lester Digby King.

09:22.601 --> 09:24.672
Ohh! See what we did there?
Huh?!

09:24.672 --> 09:26.363
Matty, what do you got
going on over there?

09:26.363 --> 09:28.780
I'm making
a salt protection circle.

09:28.780 --> 09:30.609
never talk to the dead
without one.

09:30.609 --> 09:32.749
Is that the salt
from the office break room?

09:32.749 --> 09:34.751
Another week
of flavorless lunches.

09:34.751 --> 09:36.063
Yeah, well, when shit goes south

09:36.063 --> 09:37.720
and we're all huddled
inside here,

09:37.720 --> 09:39.618
you won't be complaining
about bland fries.

09:39.618 --> 09:41.413
Could you make the salt circle
just a little bit bigger

09:41.413 --> 09:44.071
so we don't have to huddle
quite so close together?

09:44.071 --> 09:46.004
Don't forget
this episode is sponsored

09:46.004 --> 09:48.972
by Something Green
vegetable drink.

09:48.972 --> 09:50.180
Mwah!

09:53.183 --> 09:56.739
Okay. Who can tell me
what's wrong here?

10:02.054 --> 10:04.919
Your shirt has three
coffee stains on it?

10:04.919 --> 10:07.957
No. On the screen.
On the screen.

10:07.957 --> 10:09.234
Kris looks like a tool.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.063
- Eat it, Izz.
- Ugh.

10:11.063 --> 10:14.688
When we mention the sponsor,
we need to see their product.

10:14.688 --> 10:15.896
It's there.

10:15.896 --> 10:17.035
It's, uh-- It's not there.

10:17.035 --> 10:18.415
Yeah.

10:19.831 --> 10:21.764
See? It's right there.

10:21.764 --> 10:24.870
In all fairness, that is
an iced latte in there.

10:24.870 --> 10:28.115
Regardless, Kris,
you need to be holding it.

10:28.115 --> 10:29.668
Kris can't have my iced latte.

10:29.668 --> 10:31.877
I--

10:34.777 --> 10:37.262
Are we gonna start getting
reimbursed for travel expenses?

10:37.262 --> 10:39.160
- Travel expenses?
- I take the bus here.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.404
Yeah, if Matty gets
reimbursed for bus fare,

10:41.404 --> 10:44.096
then I should at least
get reimbursed for gas.

10:44.096 --> 10:45.926
We don't have the budget
for that.

10:45.926 --> 10:48.204
What about reimbursing us
for food and drink on set?

10:48.204 --> 10:51.379
Not in the budget,
but feel free to grab

10:51.379 --> 10:54.003
one of the Something Green samples.

10:54.003 --> 10:56.764
Ew! That stuff
tastes like a moldy carrot

10:56.764 --> 10:59.077
had angry sex with a lawnmower.

10:59.077 --> 11:03.046
True, but when we're on air,
let's use their slogan--

11:03.046 --> 11:05.048
"Tastes like healthy!"

11:07.016 --> 11:08.880
Okay. Look.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.226
Dude. Again?

11:10.226 --> 11:12.055
Another one of your
boring lectures?

11:12.055 --> 11:13.401
I bet it is.

11:13.401 --> 11:15.024
Guys, just let him talk.

11:15.024 --> 11:16.232
Thank you, Izzy.

11:16.232 --> 11:17.820
I've heard enough already.

11:17.820 --> 11:18.959
Yeah. Me too.

11:18.959 --> 11:20.719
Everyone, just listen!

11:20.719 --> 11:22.100
When we were in high school,

11:22.100 --> 11:24.136
we started this show for fun, right?

11:26.035 --> 11:29.797
But we also said our main goal
was to do this professionally.

11:29.797 --> 11:33.180
Matty, your parents started
charging you rent, right?

11:33.180 --> 11:35.320
The day I graduated.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.426
Chloe, your mom said
go to college or get a job.

11:39.876 --> 11:42.948
Kris, you really want to go
to dental school

11:42.948 --> 11:44.743
like your dad wants?

11:44.743 --> 11:46.883
I just threw up thinking about
Kris' hands in my mouth.

11:46.883 --> 11:48.436
And, Izzy...

11:50.024 --> 11:52.544
I-I actually don't know what
your parents want you to do.

11:52.544 --> 11:56.306
Oh, my parents are wonderful
and supportive people

11:56.306 --> 11:58.930
who encourage me
to follow my dreams.

11:58.930 --> 12:01.380
But you just moved in
to your own place, right?

12:01.380 --> 12:03.417
Yep. It was cool at first.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.764
Turns out adulting sucks.

12:05.764 --> 12:08.111
So can we all just agree
to please

12:08.111 --> 12:10.320
make the sponsors really happy

12:10.320 --> 12:13.220
so we don't have to
stop doing the show?

12:13.220 --> 12:14.462
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

12:14.462 --> 12:16.568
Okay. Great.

12:16.568 --> 12:20.054
Next on the agenda,
our new team member.

12:20.054 --> 12:21.573
- What?!
- Are you kidding me?

12:21.573 --> 12:23.471
You can't reimburse us
for food and drink,

12:23.471 --> 12:25.094
but we're getting
a new employee?

12:25.094 --> 12:26.992
He's not on-camera talent,
is he?

12:26.992 --> 12:29.374
No, he's not on-camera
talent and he's not being paid.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.894
He's a fan of the show
who volunteered to help us out,

12:31.894 --> 12:33.378
so I figured
since he's a local--

12:33.378 --> 12:35.207
So, like, an intern?

12:35.207 --> 12:37.520
Technically, no.
He's still in high school.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.591
- So it's more like a--
We can get interns?

12:39.591 --> 12:41.282
Game changer! I want an intern!

12:41.282 --> 12:42.594
What do you know
about this guy?

12:42.594 --> 12:44.285
He e-mailed us
wanting to help.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.391
Are you sure he's not
some kind of serial killer

12:46.391 --> 12:48.117
who wants to chop off
our fingers

12:48.117 --> 12:49.843
and wear them as a necklace?

12:49.843 --> 12:51.810
There's a lot of crazy
out there.

12:51.810 --> 12:53.122
And in here apparently.

12:53.122 --> 12:54.571
He's not a serial killer, Matty.

12:54.571 --> 12:57.298
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.818
Is he the weird-looking dude
that I saw on the way in here?

13:01.337 --> 13:04.858
It's okay. He's definitely
not on-camera material.

13:04.858 --> 13:07.067
I'm just gonna bring him in.

13:09.172 --> 13:11.934
Hey, uh, Ryan, could you
come on in, please?

13:11.934 --> 13:13.211
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

13:21.322 --> 13:24.463
Okay. Uh...

13:24.463 --> 13:28.398
Everyone, this is Ryan Keaton.

13:28.398 --> 13:30.504
Hey, guys.
It is so awesome to be here.

13:30.504 --> 13:32.920
So, can he fetch stuff for us?

13:32.920 --> 13:34.991
Ryan's here to help us
with whatever we need.

13:34.991 --> 13:37.338
- What about--
- As long as it's appropriate.

13:37.338 --> 13:40.100
- And what about--
- And legal.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.653
Welcome aboard, Ryan!

13:41.653 --> 13:44.276
Okay, why don't you
go grab yourself a seat

13:44.276 --> 13:46.347
and we can keep this thing
moving?

13:51.352 --> 13:54.079
- Thanks.
- Okay, so...

13:54.079 --> 13:56.530
Next episode. Any ideas?

14:00.016 --> 14:02.122
Anything at all?

14:02.122 --> 14:04.365
Feel free to just jump out
with them.

14:06.298 --> 14:09.543
There's a haunted hotel
in Sendai, Japan.

14:09.543 --> 14:11.372
We could play
Hitori Kakurenbo there.

14:11.372 --> 14:14.617
Uh, we don't have a budget
for overseas travel

14:14.617 --> 14:17.965
or any travel outside of the
tri-state area for that matter.

14:17.965 --> 14:20.588
Doesn't give us lots of options.

14:20.588 --> 14:23.660
Well, how about we play
the bath game at my place?

14:23.660 --> 14:26.491
Doesn't that game involve us
all getting in a bathtub?

14:26.491 --> 14:28.044
I mean...

14:28.044 --> 14:29.632
- Gross.
- Hm.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.635
Wha--

14:34.499 --> 14:37.398
Yeah. Ryan.

14:37.398 --> 14:40.332
What about the Elevator Game?

14:40.332 --> 14:42.610
You guys haven't played
that one yet.

14:42.610 --> 14:44.543
That's the one
where you ride an elevator

14:44.543 --> 14:48.547
to unlock a gateway
and summon some spirit?

14:48.547 --> 14:51.999
- That's the one.
- The Fifth-Floor Woman.

14:51.999 --> 14:54.450
Supposedly, she opens a portal
to the world of the dead.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.141
But if you don't
do the game right,

14:56.141 --> 14:58.419
she rips you apart, right?

14:58.419 --> 15:00.352
Kris pitched that one last year.

15:00.352 --> 15:02.527
Yeah, and we decided that no one
wants to watch us ride

15:02.527 --> 15:05.323
an elevator for 20 minutes.

15:05.323 --> 15:07.601
Sounds like an easy shoot, though.

15:09.499 --> 15:11.674
You can play it anywhere.

15:11.674 --> 15:14.228
As long as the building
has at least 10 floors.

15:14.228 --> 15:15.712
Well, that means this one's out.

15:15.712 --> 15:17.611
Well, I don't think
finding a building

15:17.611 --> 15:21.097
- is going to be a problem.
- But that's not our show.

15:21.097 --> 15:24.169
We play scary games
in scary places.

15:24.169 --> 15:28.104
So... does anyone know
of any haunted elevators?

15:28.104 --> 15:31.176
- But, uh--
- Local haunted elevators.

15:31.176 --> 15:32.350
Right.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.975
There is one.

15:36.975 --> 15:40.461
A building just a few blocks
from here, I think.

15:40.461 --> 15:43.671
I read a story online about
a girl who went missing there.

15:43.671 --> 15:46.019
They say she went missing
playing the game.

15:46.019 --> 15:48.607
"They" say?

15:48.607 --> 15:50.437
Chat groups and Reddit posts.

15:50.437 --> 15:52.577
So, unsubstantiated
online rumors.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.993
Isn't that all the Internet is?

15:54.993 --> 15:57.340
Well, I also know
that she was local.

15:57.340 --> 16:00.378
From the suburbs, at least.

16:00.378 --> 16:03.070
In high school at the time.
A freshman.

16:03.070 --> 16:07.523
The police have her
as a runaway, but like I said,

16:07.523 --> 16:10.319
rumor is it was
the Fifth-Floor Woman.

16:10.319 --> 16:12.045
Got a name?

16:13.839 --> 16:17.774
Becki... something.

16:17.774 --> 16:19.431
Can we make this happen?

16:19.431 --> 16:21.088
We can make anything happen.

16:21.088 --> 16:23.815
Question is,
do people want to see us ride

16:23.815 --> 16:26.162
an elevator for 20 minutes?

16:26.162 --> 16:29.717
Yeah. I'm already bored.

16:33.687 --> 16:35.585
So is that a no?

16:37.070 --> 16:39.244
Anybody?

16:39.244 --> 16:42.454
Okay. Uh, great suggestion,
Ryan. Maybe next time.

16:42.454 --> 16:44.180
- Uh...

16:44.180 --> 16:48.840
Oh, no! That's Mr. Klein.
I gotta take this!

16:48.840 --> 16:51.256
- Who's Mr. Klein?
- He's the sponsor!

16:51.256 --> 16:55.467
Hi, Mr. Klein!
I was just about to call you.

16:55.467 --> 16:59.195
Yeah, no, I--
I totally understand.

16:59.195 --> 17:01.335
We will make sure
it is prominently featured

17:01.335 --> 17:02.716
in the next episode.

17:02.716 --> 17:05.236
Come on. I'll show you around.

17:09.895 --> 17:14.659
This is the office.
These are our desks.

17:16.212 --> 17:18.870
That's our lavish studio.

17:18.870 --> 17:21.493
A fully stocked break room.

17:21.493 --> 17:24.634
And over there
is Kevin's office.

17:24.634 --> 17:27.430
This concludes your orientation.
Welcome aboard.

17:27.430 --> 17:29.674
Ooh.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.365
That's a lot to remember.

17:31.365 --> 17:32.746
Oh! Almost forgot!

17:32.746 --> 17:35.645
Wait till I show you
the wellness area.

17:46.346 --> 17:48.348
This is... nice.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.352
Did someone move my doll
or did it do that on its own?!

17:53.939 --> 17:56.528
Sometimes you need an escape.

18:00.532 --> 18:03.673
Thanks for helping us out.

18:05.537 --> 18:07.608
Here. Let me see your phone.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.894
In case you have
any questions...

18:22.244 --> 18:23.590
Here's my info.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.595
Thanks.

18:47.338 --> 18:48.787
This doesn't sound good.
What's going on?

18:48.787 --> 18:50.962
I think we just
lost our sponsor.

18:50.962 --> 18:54.517
Uh-huh. And I hear--
It's hard to hear you

18:54.517 --> 18:57.175
when you're using
that tone of voice.

18:57.175 --> 18:59.626
Hello? Hello?!

19:04.217 --> 19:07.599
Um, so, I just got
my ass handed to me

19:07.599 --> 19:10.223
by our very irate sponsor.

19:10.223 --> 19:12.190
If Mr. Klein
doesn't get a new episode

19:12.190 --> 19:14.227
by the end of the week,
he's pulling our funding.

19:14.227 --> 19:17.264
A completed show in a week?
That's impossible.

19:17.264 --> 19:19.715
Well, if we don't,
we lose everything

19:19.715 --> 19:22.994
that we've worked for,
so, uh, we're gonna have to.

19:22.994 --> 19:24.513
I need at least a week to edit,

19:24.513 --> 19:25.893
not to mention the time
to film it.

19:25.893 --> 19:29.311
Okay, well, uh--
We'll do Ryan's suggestion.

19:29.311 --> 19:32.693
The, uh--
The elevator thing.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.454
We can shoot it.
It's one location.

19:34.454 --> 19:35.834
It's not a lot of moving around.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.733
We can preload the graphics
to save time.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.493
And--
And we'll shoot it tonight.

19:39.493 --> 19:40.908
- What?!
- Tonight?

19:40.908 --> 19:42.600
- There's no way!
- The building you mentioned,

19:42.600 --> 19:44.326
it's an office building, right?

19:44.326 --> 19:45.948
Um, yeah, yeah.

19:45.948 --> 19:47.881
Okay, so office building
on a Saturday evening

19:47.881 --> 19:49.607
- is gonna be a ghost town.
Well put.

19:49.607 --> 19:51.333
Still doesn't get us
around the issue

19:51.333 --> 19:54.508
of going up and down in a box
for 20 minutes.

19:54.508 --> 19:58.271
Uh, we have to--
You know, no.

19:58.271 --> 20:00.307
We need to do this.

20:04.587 --> 20:06.002
Yeah, still don't know

20:06.002 --> 20:08.626
how you're gonna make
all that interesting.

20:08.626 --> 20:10.214
Just sayin'.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.012
Is that a challenge?

20:16.012 --> 20:17.462
Is he challenging us?

20:17.462 --> 20:18.843
I think he is.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.672
- I love a challenge.
- Me too.

20:20.672 --> 20:22.260
I think we should do it.

20:22.260 --> 20:23.882
Out of spite for
doubting our brilliance.

20:23.882 --> 20:25.919
Best reason ever.

20:25.919 --> 20:27.679
That sounds good to me.

20:27.679 --> 20:30.717
Um, great. Let's, uh--
Okay. Let's get a move on. Yeah?

20:30.717 --> 20:32.753
I'll start researching
the history.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.410
- I'll look up the rules.
- Send those to me

20:34.410 --> 20:36.067
when you get them,
and I'll preload the graphics.

20:36.067 --> 20:39.346
- Fuck yeah.
- Okay.

20:39.346 --> 20:41.866
Uh, what can I do?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.971
You can help me with the gear.

20:46.008 --> 20:47.527
Okay.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.789
Who's ready to get arrested
for trespassing?

21:08.789 --> 21:11.827
If someone stops us, just
pretend we're lost tourists.

21:11.827 --> 21:14.657
Hm. Lost with several bags
of video equipment.

21:14.657 --> 21:16.694
- I can do an accent!
- Please, don't.

21:16.694 --> 21:20.629
Hey. Hey. Okay.
Take this shirt.

21:20.629 --> 21:22.113
Did you run all the way here?

21:22.113 --> 21:25.461
Yeah.
Mr. Klein sent these over.

21:25.461 --> 21:28.015
He, uh--
He wants you guys to wear these.

21:28.015 --> 21:29.465
I don't do green.

21:29.465 --> 21:32.744
Guys!
I am so rocking this look.

21:32.744 --> 21:34.470
Everyone wearing the same thing?

21:34.470 --> 21:36.679
We're not worried about
losing our credibility?

21:36.679 --> 21:37.956
I don't look credible?

21:37.956 --> 21:39.751
Ugh! Can we just have
Izzy wear it?

21:39.751 --> 21:43.514
Okay. Fine. Just make sure
that she's in the shot, okay?

21:43.514 --> 21:45.654
I'm, uh--
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

21:45.654 --> 21:46.931
Does anyone want a coffee?

21:46.931 --> 21:50.383
- Iced latte!
- Uh-huh!

21:50.383 --> 21:52.419
Okay. Let's do this.

21:56.768 --> 21:58.736
This shot would look
really badass from behind.

21:58.736 --> 22:01.566
- Do you want to shoot it?
- Nah, I'll get it later.

22:11.473 --> 22:13.026
- Set it down here.
- Okay.

22:13.026 --> 22:15.373
Kris, don't forget
your body mic this time.

22:15.373 --> 22:17.375
And don't ask me
to help you hide the cord.

22:17.375 --> 22:20.378
Fool me once. Okay.
Grab that bag and follow me.

22:20.378 --> 22:21.724
Okay.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.663
After you.

22:33.011 --> 22:34.737
There's not enough room
for lighting in here,

22:34.737 --> 22:36.705
but we'll make it work.

22:42.193 --> 22:43.781
A little help?

22:45.127 --> 22:47.543
- Yeah, I got it.
- My hero.

23:01.143 --> 23:03.076
- Mnh!

23:13.500 --> 23:16.917
We are up and running, folks.

23:16.917 --> 23:19.161
You run the entire show
off that little tablet?

23:19.161 --> 23:21.784
Little tablet? This is
the mobile command center.

23:21.784 --> 23:24.753
I could launch missiles
from this "little tablet."

23:24.753 --> 23:27.445
You're just lucky
I'm a lady of peace.

23:27.445 --> 23:28.826
Okay.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.730
Am I interrupting?

23:36.730 --> 23:38.767
No, no, I'm just
going over my notes

23:38.767 --> 23:40.769
on our Fifth-Floor Woman.

23:40.769 --> 23:42.495
Find anything good?

23:42.495 --> 23:46.775
Uh, so far, I found out
that she is a vengeful ghost

23:46.775 --> 23:51.055
that haunts some place
called the Red Worlds.

23:51.055 --> 23:53.747
Oh, and she likes
ripping people apart.

23:53.747 --> 23:56.232
- She sounds great.
- A total blast.

23:56.232 --> 23:58.683
You better turn on
in the next five seconds,

23:58.683 --> 24:01.652
or I'm gonna throw you
across the room!

24:01.652 --> 24:04.102
Is it always like this?

24:04.102 --> 24:06.829
The looming specter
of potential paranormal doom

24:06.829 --> 24:10.005
accompanied by total
financial collapse?

24:10.005 --> 24:12.801
Yeah, that's normal for us.

24:12.801 --> 24:14.872
Well, you all seem
to handle it pretty well.

24:14.872 --> 24:19.255
Uh! Oh! The plug fell out.

24:19.255 --> 24:21.948
Oh, we're total pros.

24:23.743 --> 24:27.885
So, what got you into
this ghost-game stuff?

24:27.885 --> 24:29.921
Typical answer--

24:29.921 --> 24:32.234
it's fun, exciting, dangerous.

24:32.234 --> 24:35.548
I get to work
with all my friends.

24:35.548 --> 24:39.103
But the honest, boring answer--

24:39.103 --> 24:41.208
I'm a total research nerd.

24:41.208 --> 24:44.315
I like finding out things
that no one knows about.

24:44.315 --> 24:46.628
Did you know they started
pumping music into elevators

24:46.628 --> 24:50.045
in the 1920s as a way
to calm first-time passengers?

24:50.045 --> 24:51.322
I did not know that.

24:51.322 --> 24:53.324
Or that we wouldn't even
have elevators

24:53.324 --> 24:55.326
if Elisha Otis hadn't
invented the safety break.

24:55.326 --> 24:57.535
And without that,
there'd be no modern elevators,

24:57.535 --> 24:59.882
and without modern elevators,
there'd be no skyscrapers,

24:59.882 --> 25:04.024
and without skyscrapers,
there'd be no modern cities.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.750
I know all that,

25:05.750 --> 25:09.202
but I know fuck-all
about the Fifth-Floor Woman.

25:09.202 --> 25:13.240
And that is what I really
want to know about.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.623
There's got to be something
to the story, right?

25:16.623 --> 25:18.936
I hope so.

25:18.936 --> 25:21.179
Oh, and Elisha Otis
also invented

25:21.179 --> 25:23.043
the rotating bread oven.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.874
Ohh.
I do love freshly baked bread.

25:25.874 --> 25:28.014
- Oh, it's the best, right?
- Yeah.

25:29.153 --> 25:32.570
Okay! Are we all set?

25:32.570 --> 25:35.918
That doesn't look like
an iced latte.

25:35.918 --> 25:38.334
Alright. Come on. I'll show you
how to film these fools.

25:38.334 --> 25:41.027
Grab the camera and put
your hand through here.

25:41.027 --> 25:44.133
Underneath. Yep.
And then flip out the monitor.

25:44.133 --> 25:45.997
Okay. And you're gonna want
to have that facing you.

25:45.997 --> 25:48.621
And the power button.
Come on, come on, come on.

25:48.621 --> 25:52.348
Everyone in front of the
elevator for the intro, please.

25:52.348 --> 25:55.317
- Okay. Yep.
- Yeah.

25:55.317 --> 25:58.285
Yep. Just get a wider frame.

25:58.285 --> 26:00.598
Okay. Action!

26:00.598 --> 26:02.842
Oh, uh, Kris, remember--
before you tell them

26:02.842 --> 26:04.671
to smash that subscribe button,

26:04.671 --> 26:08.917
it's been moved to the lower
right-hand corner, okay?

26:08.917 --> 26:10.608
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you.

26:10.608 --> 26:13.922
Alright.
Action for real this time!

26:13.922 --> 26:16.027
Welcome to
"Nightmare on Dare Street."

26:16.027 --> 26:18.305
I'm your host, Kris.

26:18.305 --> 26:20.342
And today,
we'll be tackling a creepy

26:20.342 --> 26:23.345
little Internet legend called...

26:23.345 --> 26:25.243
the Elevator Game.

26:25.243 --> 26:27.004
Now, for years we've pondered,

26:27.004 --> 26:30.214
"Is there more to life
than this?"

26:30.214 --> 26:31.871
Well, tonight, the Elevator Game

26:31.871 --> 26:34.149
might finally answer
that question.

26:34.149 --> 26:36.910
But with the Elevator Game,

26:36.910 --> 26:38.912
we aren't just
summoning spirits.

26:38.912 --> 26:41.812
No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:41.812 --> 26:47.127
We are opening a door
to a cursed, ghostly realm...

26:47.127 --> 26:50.855
with the help, of course,
from the Fifth-Floor Woman.

26:50.855 --> 26:52.201
Chloe?

26:52.201 --> 26:54.790
She lives in her own private
land of the dead

26:54.790 --> 26:56.827
they call "The Red World."

26:56.827 --> 26:59.208
But if we play the game
just right,

26:59.208 --> 27:01.107
she'll open the door
and let us inside.

27:01.107 --> 27:02.280
Matty?

27:02.280 --> 27:05.421
Uh, okay.
So, here's how you play.

27:05.421 --> 27:07.872
You go to each floor
in the following order--

27:07.872 --> 27:14.154
4, 2, 6, 2, 10, 5, and 1.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.431
Okay. Sounds simple enough.

27:15.431 --> 27:18.124
But wait. There's more.

27:18.124 --> 27:19.746
When you reach the fifth floor,

27:19.746 --> 27:21.679
the doors will open
and a woman will step on.

27:21.679 --> 27:23.750
She'll step on
and stand behind you.

27:23.750 --> 27:26.442
Now, you can't turn to look at
her and you can't speak to her.

27:26.442 --> 27:28.444
Remember, when you reach
the fifth floor,

27:28.444 --> 27:30.895
you must keep your eyes closed
and your mouth shut.

27:30.895 --> 27:35.106
Whatever you do, don't turn
around and don't look at her.

27:35.106 --> 27:39.455
But... what happens
if we do look?

27:39.455 --> 27:43.874
Well, Kris, if you see her
or talk to her,

27:43.874 --> 27:46.428
- she will rip you apart.
Get them both in frame.

27:46.428 --> 27:48.948
If you look back
before finishing the game,

27:48.948 --> 27:50.950
she will curse you
with her presence.

27:50.950 --> 27:53.711
She will haunt you
like a waking nightmare.

27:53.711 --> 27:56.887
And when she's had her fill,
she will shred you to pieces,

27:56.887 --> 28:00.338
both body and soul.

28:00.338 --> 28:03.169
- Oh, shit!
- Oh. Okay.

28:03.169 --> 28:05.067
Um...

28:05.067 --> 28:07.173
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Spread it out. Thank you.

28:07.173 --> 28:10.003
Today's
episode is brought to you

28:23.810 --> 28:26.813
Alright. You guys ready to see
the other side or what?

28:26.813 --> 28:28.746
- Ready!
- I'm not quite sure yet.

28:28.746 --> 28:30.886
- Overruled, Matty.
- Okay.

28:30.886 --> 28:34.510
Okay.
Step one, enter the elevator.

28:37.444 --> 28:39.826
I thought you said
the building was empty.

28:42.864 --> 28:45.142
Elevator small talk?
How about that weather?

28:45.142 --> 28:47.903
You see that game last night?

28:47.903 --> 28:49.974
I wonder if life
is just an endless loop

28:49.974 --> 28:52.252
of creation and destruction
and hell is the realization

28:52.252 --> 28:55.324
that we're powerless
to alter the course?

28:56.843 --> 28:59.363
- Oh, good. It's here.
- Okay.

29:02.573 --> 29:04.989
Okay. First, we go to four.

29:04.989 --> 29:06.508
- Wait. Four first?
- First is four.

29:06.508 --> 29:08.579
- No, first floor is--
- No, fourth floor is first.

29:08.579 --> 29:10.995
- Press four.
- I was wrong.

29:10.995 --> 29:12.859
This is hell.

29:15.862 --> 29:18.106
See you on the other side.

29:27.874 --> 29:29.911
Well, that sounds up to code.

29:52.071 --> 29:55.246
Okay.

29:55.246 --> 29:58.353
Should we mention that girl?

29:58.353 --> 30:00.527
- Who?
- That Becki girl.

30:00.527 --> 30:04.048
You know, the one
that disappeared?

30:04.048 --> 30:07.362
Oh. Yeah, sure.
Knock yourself out.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.469
Okay.

30:11.469 --> 30:13.575
Next stop is two.

30:17.234 --> 30:20.064
Now, what makes today's episode
even more special

30:20.064 --> 30:23.481
is that we have evidence
the game actually works.

30:23.481 --> 30:26.208
Her name was Becki,
and supposedly

30:26.208 --> 30:29.177
she is the Fifth-Floor Woman's
latest victim.

30:29.177 --> 30:31.041
And according
to our investigation,

30:31.041 --> 30:33.906
this is the very elevator
she vanished from.

30:33.906 --> 30:36.909
Go to www.nightmare-on-
dare-street.com.

30:36.909 --> 30:38.876
There, you'll find all
the details we've compiled--

30:38.876 --> 30:40.913
And while you're there,
you may as well go ahead

30:40.913 --> 30:42.535
and smash the subscribe button

30:42.535 --> 30:45.020
on the lower left-hand corner
of your screen.

30:45.020 --> 30:46.504
Right! Right-hand corner!

30:46.504 --> 30:48.368
I'll fix it in post.

30:58.033 --> 31:00.311
Sex anyone?

31:00.311 --> 31:02.106
You are so witty.

31:09.355 --> 31:10.494
You doing alright?

31:10.494 --> 31:15.016
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

31:15.016 --> 31:18.640
Nothing. You're just usually
a lot more chatty on camera.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.125
Hm.

31:21.125 --> 31:23.265
I don't know.

31:23.265 --> 31:25.233
I feel like I've talked enough
this episode, honestly.

31:25.233 --> 31:28.167
Since when have you
ever thought that?

31:33.586 --> 31:36.347
Let's just finish this, okay?

31:36.347 --> 31:37.659
Yeah.

31:37.659 --> 31:41.559
And now back to two!

31:41.559 --> 31:43.354
Again.

31:49.567 --> 31:52.260
No, no, no!
Don't glitch out on me!

31:52.260 --> 31:54.227
Come on, Izz.

31:56.505 --> 31:59.060
Nothing to worry about.
Just some interference.

32:06.688 --> 32:10.519
Well, the second floor
looks the exact same,

32:10.519 --> 32:13.729
just as it did
a few minutes ago.

32:18.148 --> 32:20.046
Hello?! Anybody there?!

32:20.046 --> 32:22.497
Are you trying to get someone
to call the cops on us?

32:22.497 --> 32:25.189
Relax! I'm just trying
to stir up some ghosts!

32:29.642 --> 32:34.060
No sign of the
Fifth-Floor Woman yet.

32:34.060 --> 32:37.270
Probably because we haven't gone
to the fifth floor yet.

32:37.270 --> 32:40.032
- Alright.

32:40.032 --> 32:43.104
Whoa. Yes! Yes! That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

32:43.104 --> 32:44.760
Holy...

32:44.760 --> 32:46.314
I-I'm gonna take the stairs.

32:46.314 --> 32:48.109
What? No, no, no.

32:48.109 --> 32:51.733
Everyone exits the elevator
when the game ends or else.

32:51.733 --> 32:54.184
Or else what?

32:54.184 --> 32:58.222
Curses. Soul shredding.
And we lose the episode.

33:00.776 --> 33:04.815
Ugh! Nothing to worry about.

33:04.815 --> 33:07.093
See? All good.

33:21.142 --> 33:23.247
Well...

33:23.247 --> 33:26.492
it's time for
the moment of truth.

33:26.492 --> 33:30.461
Finally time to head
to the fifth floor!

33:30.461 --> 33:31.773
Oh!

33:31.773 --> 33:33.499
A woman will enter.

33:33.499 --> 33:35.328
Do not look at her
and do not talk to her

33:35.328 --> 33:39.229
because she is not human
and she will rip you apart.

33:39.229 --> 33:42.749
Shredding your body and soul.

33:42.749 --> 33:45.062
Ohh!

33:45.062 --> 33:47.375
Anyone else feel like
taking a peek?

33:47.375 --> 33:49.239
Dude, don't you fricking dare.

33:49.239 --> 33:53.174
Oh, come on, dude.
Just a tiny peek. Huh?

33:59.835 --> 34:01.423
It's looking better.

34:01.423 --> 34:03.080
- So, like, does this--
- Don't touch it, man.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.496
- Trust me. You--
- Okay.

34:05.496 --> 34:09.086
Izzy's a little particular
about things like that.

34:09.086 --> 34:10.708
He'll learn.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.884
That looks good.
That looks really good.

34:13.884 --> 34:15.575
- As long as it stays stable.
- Yeah, I think it--

34:15.575 --> 34:18.509
- Izz, security.
- Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide!

34:18.509 --> 34:20.580
- Hide where?
- In the corner!

34:28.174 --> 34:30.142
Everything's secure outside...

34:30.142 --> 34:31.695
- Oh, no. My baby.
- No!

34:31.695 --> 34:34.146
Okay. Yeah.
- Shhhh.

34:34.146 --> 34:35.526
Quiet.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.640
- I wanna look.
- Stop it, Kris.

34:45.640 --> 34:48.125
Dude, it's gonna make
a much more interesting episode

34:48.125 --> 34:49.816
- than this.
- I'm gonna push the stop button

34:49.816 --> 34:52.233
- right now, I swear to God.
- Okay, both of you, stop!

34:52.233 --> 34:54.511
Matty, he's just joking, okay?

34:54.511 --> 34:58.860
Kris, you're just joking.
Say it.

34:58.860 --> 35:01.828
I'm just joking, Matty.
I won't look.

35:01.828 --> 35:03.692
- Swear it.
- Okay, yeah, whatever, fine.

35:03.692 --> 35:05.211
I'm not gonna look, I swear.

35:05.211 --> 35:07.386
Okay. Eyes closed.

35:50.774 --> 35:54.329
What's he doing?

35:54.329 --> 35:56.297
He's talking on his phone.

36:13.624 --> 36:17.456
Okay. Final step, press one.

36:17.456 --> 36:20.528
If we did this right, the
elevator should go up to ten.

36:32.056 --> 36:34.818
Oh, we're going up!
No frickin' way!

36:34.818 --> 36:36.509
What's he doing now?

36:36.509 --> 36:39.029
Oh, he's gone, he's gone.

36:39.029 --> 36:40.996
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

36:40.996 --> 36:42.826
What? What, what, what?

36:42.826 --> 36:44.621
- I don't know what's happening.
- Why is there no picture?

36:44.621 --> 36:46.036
I don't know. I'm trying
to figure that out!

36:46.036 --> 36:48.314
Dude, that's not funny.
You hit ten, didn't you?

36:48.314 --> 36:49.591
Chill.
I didn't do anything, Matty.

36:49.591 --> 36:51.041
Oh, God. She's pulling us up.

36:51.041 --> 36:52.698
It's probably just some
kind of maintenance code.

36:52.698 --> 36:53.837
No, no. We have to get off!
We have to get off!

36:53.837 --> 36:55.735
- No, Matty! No!
- Stop right here!

36:55.735 --> 36:57.565
- No!

36:57.565 --> 36:59.636
- Why are we stopping on nine?
- Something's not right here.

36:59.636 --> 37:02.846
Well, maybe it's
the Fifth-Floor Woman.

37:02.846 --> 37:07.540
No, tell him not to sign
the paper... work.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.818
How the fuck
did you get in here?

37:09.818 --> 37:11.648
Um...

37:11.648 --> 37:14.616
The file's on me.

37:17.964 --> 37:20.588
- No, no, no, no, I don't care.

37:20.588 --> 37:22.900
She can keep the kids.
I get the house.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.799
Yeah, well, you can
tell her that 50%...

37:24.799 --> 37:28.320
- Solid excitement.
- Don't start, Kris.

37:28.320 --> 37:31.978
- So are we done?
- How'd the footage look?

37:31.978 --> 37:34.326
- About that...
What happened?

37:34.326 --> 37:36.811
I don't know.
Thick elevator walls.

37:36.811 --> 37:39.296
Lead pipes.
Some weird interference.

37:39.296 --> 37:40.711
Meaning?

37:40.711 --> 37:44.025
Meaning we lost
a healthy chunk of footage.

37:44.025 --> 37:47.097
What?!
Well, how much did we lose?

37:47.097 --> 37:48.719
- Ask Izzy.
- How much did we lose?

37:48.719 --> 37:50.687
- I'd say the last half.
- Great.

37:50.687 --> 37:52.378
We wouldn't have had to
rush if you would've--

37:52.378 --> 37:53.448
So, what do we do now?

38:02.423 --> 38:04.425
Chloe, don't.

38:04.425 --> 38:07.876
- Did you hear that?
Hear what?

38:07.876 --> 38:12.329
Uh... nothing.
Just-- It was nothing.

38:12.329 --> 38:13.848
Do it again!

38:16.437 --> 38:18.335
One more time.

38:18.335 --> 38:19.750
But...

38:19.750 --> 38:22.374
put all the gear in the elevator
this time.

38:24.168 --> 38:27.827
Yeah. No can do.
I gotta get home.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.519
- Yeah. Me too.
- Mm-hmm.

38:29.519 --> 38:31.866
Do we have any usable footage?

38:31.866 --> 38:33.764
I'll head back to the office
and check.

38:33.764 --> 38:35.939
I might be able to
scrape something together.

38:35.939 --> 38:39.356
- Okay. I'll go with you.
- Is it worth it?

38:39.356 --> 38:41.669
Unless you have anything else
that you can throw together--

38:41.669 --> 38:44.361
Kris is just afraid that this is
all gonna tie him back to Becki.

38:46.984 --> 38:49.055
Uh...

38:53.025 --> 38:55.096
The girl who went missing.

38:55.096 --> 38:58.720
Kris knows her. Right?

39:01.205 --> 39:05.071
She was a huge fan of the show,
and then you hooked up with her.

39:05.071 --> 39:07.384
How do you know that?

39:10.560 --> 39:12.665
I'm her brother.

39:16.807 --> 39:19.120
I found your DMs on her laptop.

39:19.120 --> 39:22.675
She told you how much
she loved the show.

39:22.675 --> 39:25.747
And then you had sex with her.

39:25.747 --> 39:28.474
A week later, she went missing.

39:28.474 --> 39:31.960
You know,
she was just a freshman.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.721
Is this true?

39:36.206 --> 39:39.209
Come on, man.

39:39.209 --> 39:40.521
I was in high school then.

39:40.521 --> 39:42.005
High school was a month ago!

39:42.005 --> 39:46.181
You hooked up with Becki
and then you ghosted her...

39:46.181 --> 39:49.944
but not before telling her
all about the Elevator Game.

39:49.944 --> 39:52.187
You told her to play it
and record it,

39:52.187 --> 39:57.814
that you'd put it up on the Web
and make her famous.

39:57.814 --> 39:59.678
When you stopped responding,

39:59.678 --> 40:03.544
she decided
to play it on her own

40:03.544 --> 40:05.028
just to fucking impress you.

40:05.028 --> 40:06.788
This is so gross, Kris.
- What?

40:06.788 --> 40:08.169
You knew she was a fan,

40:08.169 --> 40:10.102
and you used that
to take advantage of her.

40:10.102 --> 40:12.242
The fact that we even have to
explain this to you

40:12.242 --> 40:14.106
- is even grosser.
- You know, you've done

40:14.106 --> 40:15.935
skeevy shit before, Kris,
but promising

40:15.935 --> 40:17.661
you'd make her famous is--

40:17.661 --> 40:21.458
This could destroy everything
that we've worked for.

40:21.458 --> 40:24.185
Yeah, well, it's not like
I'm responsible

40:24.185 --> 40:26.567
- for her disappearance!
- No!

40:28.810 --> 40:30.881
But I need your help
finding her.

40:36.577 --> 40:39.787
Oh, wow.

40:39.787 --> 40:44.861
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

40:44.861 --> 40:47.277
You are fucking pathetic.

40:47.277 --> 40:49.072
You know that?

40:52.903 --> 40:55.181
So you actually think

40:55.181 --> 40:59.116
that she's lost
in the fucking Red World?!

40:59.116 --> 41:00.635
Huh?!

41:05.709 --> 41:08.056
You're a fucking joke.

41:08.056 --> 41:10.887
So let me explain this in a way
that your little walnut

41:10.887 --> 41:13.752
of a brain
can actually comprehend.

41:13.752 --> 41:16.030
Okay?

41:16.030 --> 41:19.827
Your loser sister ran away.

41:19.827 --> 41:21.553
Hey, guys! Guys, guys, guys!

41:25.073 --> 41:26.523
Stop!

41:26.523 --> 41:28.905
Fuck you!
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

41:28.905 --> 41:31.701
And fuck you! Okay?! Okay?!

41:31.701 --> 41:35.808
This has nothing to do with me!
Nothing! I'm out!

41:35.808 --> 41:38.984
You kids can't be in here.
You all have to leave. Now.

41:38.984 --> 41:41.227
- Yep.
- Yes, sir.

41:45.231 --> 41:47.717
Alright. Let's go.
Everyone out.

41:47.717 --> 41:50.651
Yeah, yeah.

41:50.651 --> 41:52.238
Faster, faster. Come on.

41:52.238 --> 41:53.999
Come on.
Let's get back to the office.

41:53.999 --> 41:55.794
Yeah. Yeah.

41:55.794 --> 41:57.934
Pick up your feet. Let's go.

41:57.934 --> 42:00.281
I don't want to see you kids
back here.

42:00.281 --> 42:02.041
Hey, Chloe.

42:05.976 --> 42:08.358
I'm sorry I didn't say
anything before.

42:08.358 --> 42:10.878
No, you're not.

42:10.878 --> 42:14.985
Kris is a total asshole,
and he deserved this, but...

42:14.985 --> 42:16.918
you lied and used all of us

42:16.918 --> 42:19.162
to get to this exact moment, right?

42:21.716 --> 42:24.961
Shit. I-I'm sorry.

42:24.961 --> 42:26.790
Yeah.

42:26.790 --> 42:31.692
And I am really sorry
about your sister.

42:31.692 --> 42:33.625
I hope she turns up safe.

43:09.971 --> 43:13.630
What could you possibly have
to say to me right now?

43:13.630 --> 43:17.910
Okay. Look.
What am I supposed to do?

43:17.910 --> 43:21.017
You're asking me? Because
my feelings are pretty raw

43:21.017 --> 43:23.260
and you are not gonna
like my answer.

43:33.754 --> 43:36.342
Chloe, you there? Chlo--

43:38.897 --> 43:42.935
Yeah, I'm-- I'm here.

43:42.935 --> 43:46.456
Okay, well...

43:46.456 --> 43:49.148
Look. I'm almost home.

43:49.148 --> 43:51.944
Okay? I j--

43:51.944 --> 43:55.914
I just want to talk. That's it.

43:55.914 --> 43:58.433
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

44:00.056 --> 44:01.402
Kris?

44:03.404 --> 44:05.337
Chloe?

44:14.070 --> 44:15.727
- Chloe?

45:24.968 --> 45:26.383
Hello?

48:15.518 --> 48:17.037
I can't believe
he would do this.

48:17.037 --> 48:18.348
Yeah, but we've
known him for years.

48:18.348 --> 48:19.729
There's no way--

48:19.729 --> 48:21.075
I mean,
I should have expected this.

48:21.075 --> 48:23.146
This is so on par for him,
but ugh.

48:23.146 --> 48:24.941
I know.
I just didn't think that--

48:26.115 --> 48:28.324
So, we can't have Kris
on the show anymore.

48:28.324 --> 48:29.739
Agreed.

48:29.739 --> 48:32.431
Uh, I guess we could start
auditioning Monday

48:32.431 --> 48:35.020
and get some sort of...

48:35.020 --> 48:37.022
- Oh, no!
- ...background check.

48:37.022 --> 48:38.644
- What?
- You wouldn't have happened

48:38.644 --> 48:40.681
to have grabbed a camera
from the elevator, would you?

48:40.681 --> 48:42.338
No.

48:42.338 --> 48:44.133
Then I left a camera
back in the elevator.

48:44.133 --> 48:46.135
Uh, which-- which one?

48:46.135 --> 48:47.722
The one in the corner
that now contains

48:47.722 --> 48:50.415
a healthy amount of footage
of us totally trespassing.

48:50.415 --> 48:51.761
Huh.

48:51.761 --> 48:53.452
You want me to go back for it,
don't you?

48:55.075 --> 48:57.353
Very, very much so.

48:58.250 --> 48:59.700
By myself?

48:59.700 --> 49:01.012
At night?

49:03.083 --> 49:05.085
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

49:05.085 --> 49:06.776
Yeah, yeah.
Let's hurry, though.

49:06.776 --> 49:08.605
- I gotta check the footage.
Yeah, I know.

49:50.440 --> 49:54.030
<i>♪ Your thoughts
were hiding from me ♪</i>

49:54.030 --> 49:57.758
<i>♪ Where you at, where you at,
where you at?♪</i>

49:59.139 --> 50:01.520
<i>♪ Where you at, where you at? ♪</i>

50:09.494 --> 50:11.047
Okay.

50:42.803 --> 50:43.838
Okay.

50:43.838 --> 50:45.081
Fifth.

52:02.607 --> 52:04.126
Oh, my God.

55:07.481 --> 55:08.793
Becki?

55:33.196 --> 55:34.612
Hello?

56:00.154 --> 56:02.122
All clear.

56:03.744 --> 56:05.677
Thanks, Mr. Bond.

56:24.247 --> 56:25.904
Hey, can I get a hand?

56:25.904 --> 56:28.631
I got these little T-Rex arms,
so I can't really--

56:28.631 --> 56:29.805
You know?

56:30.564 --> 56:32.186
That's better.

56:32.186 --> 56:34.948
You're pretty when you smile.
You should do it more often.

56:36.052 --> 56:37.571
What are you doing?

56:37.571 --> 56:39.608
- Having fun.
- We don't have time for that.

56:39.608 --> 56:41.126
Oh, there's
always time for fun.

56:55.727 --> 56:58.523
I believe two is next
on our journey?

57:03.010 --> 57:04.702
So, what's got you
all worked up?

57:04.702 --> 57:06.945
You're all silent
and despondent.

57:06.945 --> 57:09.603
It can't just be
our failing start-up.

57:10.293 --> 57:11.881
Come on, come on.

57:17.577 --> 57:19.544
Come on.
Spill it, Kev.

57:31.522 --> 57:33.731
You know how
I put the deposit down

57:33.731 --> 57:36.009
on the office building
and I said we had enough money

57:36.009 --> 57:37.562
to float us for a month or two?

57:37.562 --> 57:38.770
Yeah.
Was that not true?

57:40.738 --> 57:43.913
No, the problem
is where the money came from.

57:43.913 --> 57:45.777
You didn't get it
from some loan sharks

57:45.777 --> 57:48.021
who break kneecaps, did you?

57:48.021 --> 57:50.782
I wish. That money
was from my savings account

57:50.782 --> 57:53.233
and supposed to be tuition
for my first year of college.

57:53.233 --> 57:55.925
Oh, my God.
Seriously?

57:55.925 --> 57:58.480
Yeah.

58:06.798 --> 58:10.077
So, I take it your dad
found out?

58:10.077 --> 58:11.631
Yeah.

58:11.631 --> 58:13.633
Well, you're still alive.

58:13.633 --> 58:14.806
That's a good sign.

58:14.806 --> 58:16.152
I am.

58:16.152 --> 58:17.982
Been sleeping at the office
ever since.

58:17.982 --> 58:20.018
Or... you can stay at my place

58:20.018 --> 58:22.193
until you get things
figured out with your folks.

58:22.193 --> 58:23.125
Thanks.

58:27.992 --> 58:30.028
Okay.

58:30.028 --> 58:32.306
Can we get back
to the office now?

58:32.306 --> 58:34.274
I want to reach out to
a few more possible sponsors

58:34.274 --> 58:35.827
before we call it a night, so...

58:35.827 --> 58:37.173
Sure.

58:37.173 --> 58:39.659
But we do only have
one more floor left.

58:39.659 --> 58:41.730
You want to finish the game?

58:42.731 --> 58:44.249
Fine.

58:45.319 --> 58:47.149
Might as well get
some more footage out of it.

58:48.840 --> 58:49.772
Okay.

59:15.246 --> 59:17.731
Fifth floor.

59:17.731 --> 59:19.146
Hello?

59:19.146 --> 59:21.217
Fifth-Floor Woman?

59:22.840 --> 59:25.221
Oh, wait, I wasn't
supposed to look.

59:25.221 --> 59:26.740
Okay.

59:26.740 --> 59:28.949
Well, we had our fun.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.436
Come on.

01:00:19.862 --> 01:00:21.657
Close!

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.696
Close!

01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:29.354
Close, God damn it!

01:00:40.711 --> 01:00:41.988

Okay, you and your friends
are in danger.

01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:40.028
What?

01:03:40.028 --> 01:03:42.064
It's real, Chloe, the game.

01:03:42.064 --> 01:03:43.376
I, uh--

01:03:45.412 --> 01:03:47.311
I have to talk to you.

01:03:48.588 --> 01:03:49.969
Chloe?

01:03:51.004 --> 01:03:52.281
Fuck.

01:03:53.317 --> 01:03:57.148
Okay, um, can you meet me
at the office in 15?

01:03:57.148 --> 01:04:00.186
- I'll be in the wellness area.
- Okay. Okay!

01:04:16.236 --> 01:04:18.998
Ugh, what's going on?

01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:31.493
Hello?

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:33.598
Anyone there?

01:04:40.053 --> 01:04:41.986
Come on.

01:04:41.986 --> 01:04:45.369
Any day now.

01:04:45.369 --> 01:04:48.096
Hello?

01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:49.580
Nope.

01:04:51.478 --> 01:04:53.480
Ugh.

01:05:10.463 --> 01:05:12.016
<i>You've reached</i>

01:05:12.016 --> 01:05:14.018
<i>the bus transit
after-hours help line.</i>

01:05:14.018 --> 01:05:15.744
<i>Due to higher than normal

01:05:15.744 --> 01:05:18.609
<i>your wait could be as long

01:05:18.609 --> 01:05:21.474
You fuckin'-- Ugh!

01:06:05.173 --> 01:06:06.519
Ah!

01:06:37.032 --> 01:06:39.034
Shit!

01:06:39.034 --> 01:06:41.174
Fuck! Aah!

01:06:42.762 --> 01:06:46.110
Fuck me!

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:48.388
Shit, shit, shit!
Shit, no fucking way.

01:06:48.388 --> 01:06:50.321
We opened the door.
Now she's out to get us!

01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:52.047
Now what do we do,
what do we do?

01:06:52.047 --> 01:06:53.497
Chloe, Chloe.
I'll call Chloe!

01:07:03.403 --> 01:07:04.853
Hey, Matty,
I tried calling you--

01:07:04.853 --> 01:07:07.442
Stop talking! I need you
to meet me at the office!

01:07:07.442 --> 01:07:08.546
What?!

01:07:08.546 --> 01:07:10.307
Shit, shit.

01:07:10.307 --> 01:07:12.102
Matty, are you okay?

01:07:12.102 --> 01:07:14.173
I'm at the office now, I--

01:07:14.173 --> 01:07:16.416
Okay, perfect.
I-I'll see you there!

01:07:19.868 --> 01:07:21.283
No!

01:07:23.147 --> 01:07:25.770
Salt, salt, gotta find salt,
gotta find salt.

01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:29.498
Okay, this will do.

01:07:34.158 --> 01:07:35.608
Can I help you?

01:07:35.608 --> 01:07:37.541
Uh, no, no, I'm good.

01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:41.131
I-I see my party
sitting right over there.

01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:43.340
I need this, actually.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.858
Okay, so, it's a door,
it's a door, it has to be.

01:07:44.858 --> 01:07:46.860
It's a portal.
That's the only explanation.

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.690
- Hey, hi. Sorry.
- Excuse me.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:51.210
And then because
she's a sleep paralysis

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:53.212
or a walking nightmare
stuck between the existence

01:07:53.212 --> 01:07:55.386
and the--
Are you done with that? Thanks!

01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:58.803
Do you have anything courser?

01:07:58.803 --> 01:08:00.391
I'm calling the police.

01:08:00.391 --> 01:08:01.910
Yeah, okay, sure,
you do that.

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:04.430
Uh... okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:06.121
Okay, Matty,

01:08:06.121 --> 01:08:07.916
so now we just gotta figure
how to close the door.

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:10.401
No shit we gotta
close the door, but how?

01:08:10.401 --> 01:08:11.747
Bingo!

01:08:11.747 --> 01:08:14.785
Yes, hello?
Some kid just wandered in...

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:17.201
Get off me, get off me!

01:08:18.547 --> 01:08:19.928
Just get the hell out of here!

01:08:19.928 --> 01:08:21.550
Right.
Right, okay, no problem.

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:23.897
'Cause-- 'Cause Chloe
likes researching things.

01:08:23.897 --> 01:08:26.417
- Close the door.
- You guys have to do something.

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:29.765
Yeah, she'll figure out a way
to close the door.

01:08:29.765 --> 01:08:31.767
- Perfect.
Hey.

01:08:31.767 --> 01:08:33.286
Hey!

01:08:34.356 --> 01:08:36.393
Yeah, uh, thank you
for the lovely evening.

01:08:36.393 --> 01:08:37.566
Five stars! Oh.

01:08:37.566 --> 01:08:40.707
Can't forget this.

01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:43.193
I am so, so sorry, everybody.

01:08:43.883 --> 01:08:45.781
Hello?
Hello?

01:09:14.016 --> 01:09:15.328
I have mace.

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:19.919
And if you do anything weird,
I'll just--

01:09:19.919 --> 01:09:21.369
I'll throw you off the building.

01:09:29.308 --> 01:09:30.343
Now talk.

01:10:06.931 --> 01:10:07.967
It worked.

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:13.006
I was there...

01:10:13.006 --> 01:10:14.525
in her world.

01:10:14.525 --> 01:10:15.871
The game worked.

01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:18.943
What are you talking about?

01:10:18.943 --> 01:10:20.704
I had to find out.

01:10:20.704 --> 01:10:23.534
I had to see if my sister
was there.

01:10:25.018 --> 01:10:28.470
I went back to the building
and I played the game by myself.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.027
I was there!

01:10:34.027 --> 01:10:35.753
This is completely insane.

01:10:35.753 --> 01:10:37.962
No, it's real, Chloe!

01:10:37.962 --> 01:10:40.275
The Red World,
the Fifth-Floor Woman,

01:10:40.275 --> 01:10:42.415
the entire goddamn game is real!

01:10:42.415 --> 01:10:43.968
Okay, I need you to go!

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:46.695
Well, I found this...

01:10:46.695 --> 01:10:49.008
on the floor of the elevator.

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:52.943
I think something happened
to Izzy and Kevin.

01:10:55.048 --> 01:10:56.809
Just-- Just watch it.

01:11:09.684 --> 01:11:12.825
I-I need to call everyone.

01:11:12.825 --> 01:11:14.482
We need to take this
to the police.

01:11:14.482 --> 01:11:16.932
The police can't help us, Chloe.

01:11:16.932 --> 01:11:19.728
Look, I don't know you!
And I don't really trust you!

01:11:19.728 --> 01:11:22.835
Chloe, I am sorry about
how this all went down,

01:11:22.835 --> 01:11:24.423
I really, truly am.

01:11:25.493 --> 01:11:27.874
But the police gave up
on finding Becki.

01:11:27.874 --> 01:11:30.705
Even my parents gave up
on finding her.

01:11:32.534 --> 01:11:34.295
But I can't give up.

01:11:35.779 --> 01:11:37.953
I know she would never run away.

01:11:39.748 --> 01:11:41.647
Look, if you lost someone
that close to you,

01:11:41.647 --> 01:11:44.615
wouldn't you do anything
to help find them?

01:11:47.687 --> 01:11:49.379
Look, I needed your help

01:11:49.379 --> 01:11:51.795
and I just didn't want you all
to think I was crazy.

01:11:55.557 --> 01:11:56.696
No.

01:11:58.733 --> 01:12:00.597
This is Kris' fault.

01:12:01.598 --> 01:12:06.119
And what he did
is absolutely awful, but...

01:12:06.119 --> 01:12:09.053
right now, I'm more concerned

01:12:09.053 --> 01:12:11.677
with making sure
my friends are okay.

01:12:21.928 --> 01:12:25.035
What-- What is all this?

01:12:34.147 --> 01:12:36.909
T-This wasn't here before.
I--

01:12:54.616 --> 01:12:56.480
- Oh!
- Ah! What the fuck, Chloe?

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.413
- Sorry, I'm sorry!
- What was the for?

01:12:58.413 --> 01:13:00.208
My nerves are on edge
right now, okay?

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:02.797
Oh, and this guy's back.

01:13:02.797 --> 01:13:04.764
Break up any more
web shows today?

01:13:04.764 --> 01:13:07.111
Don't touch the circle.

01:13:08.492 --> 01:13:11.012
What the hell is all this?

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:13.635
Nourishment. It's gonna be
a long night here, folks.

01:13:13.635 --> 01:13:15.223
That doesn't answer
my question, Matty.

01:13:15.223 --> 01:13:17.398
Just get inside the circle.
I'll explain everything.

01:13:18.606 --> 01:13:22.057
Do you have to drag your feet
when you walk?

01:13:26.752 --> 01:13:31.688
Okay, so, here's what's up.

01:13:31.688 --> 01:13:33.034
Something happened
when we played the game.

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:34.691
We-- We broke a rule.

01:13:34.691 --> 01:13:36.486
I thought the game
was ruined by that office guy.

01:13:36.486 --> 01:13:37.763
See, that's what I thought, too,

01:13:37.763 --> 01:13:38.867
but then I started
thinking about it.

01:13:38.867 --> 01:13:40.144
And Kris hit the last button.

01:13:40.144 --> 01:13:42.492
He pressed one.
But then we went up.

01:13:44.977 --> 01:13:46.461
So, you actually did
open the door.

01:13:46.461 --> 01:13:47.773
Exactly.

01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:51.224
You're supposed to
add water to that.

01:13:51.224 --> 01:13:53.779
That... makes sense.

01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:57.714
And then you looked back?

01:13:57.714 --> 01:13:59.854
I looked back
'cause Chloe looked back.

01:14:00.958 --> 01:14:02.822
Are you guys seriously
blaming me?

01:14:02.822 --> 01:14:05.169
And what, you're both
claiming to be cursed?

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.724
Wait, how did he get cursed?

01:14:07.724 --> 01:14:09.967
Oh, he went back
and played solo.

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:11.244
That was dumb.

01:14:11.244 --> 01:14:13.902
Look, I am not spending my night

01:14:13.902 --> 01:14:16.560
standing in a circle of salt
and votive candles.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.837
What happened when you did it?

01:14:21.013 --> 01:14:23.015
No... way, bro!

01:14:23.015 --> 01:14:24.844
You saw the Red World,
didn't you?

01:14:24.844 --> 01:14:26.846
Did you go in?

01:14:26.846 --> 01:14:29.055
Yeah.
- That is so frickin' cool!

01:14:29.055 --> 01:14:30.747
Oh, my gosh, what was it--

01:14:30.747 --> 01:14:32.645
That's the dumbest thing
you could have ever done.

01:14:32.645 --> 01:14:33.853
Why would you do that?

01:14:33.853 --> 01:14:36.787
He thought he could
find his sister.

01:14:39.549 --> 01:14:40.619
Oh.

01:14:41.723 --> 01:14:44.277
Wow. Now we have to find a way
to close the door.

01:14:44.277 --> 01:14:46.832
Okay, we need to go
to the police.

01:14:46.832 --> 01:14:49.213
You can't call the cops
on a ghost, Chloe.

01:14:49.213 --> 01:14:50.663
I really think something bad

01:14:50.663 --> 01:14:51.940
has happened to Kevin and Izzy.

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.528
Did they play, too?

01:14:53.528 --> 01:14:56.324
I think, and something
may have scared them!

01:14:56.324 --> 01:14:58.222
- Yeah, the F--
If you say

01:14:58.222 --> 01:14:59.914
they were attacked by a fucking
ghost woman, I swear to God...

01:14:59.914 --> 01:15:02.744
Look, did you find
anything else in your research?

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.545
What'd you find, Chlo?

01:15:12.685 --> 01:15:16.620
I traced the game back to a news
story from a few decades ago.

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.899
It was during
a sorority pledge weekend.

01:15:19.899 --> 01:15:23.213
They-- They took one of the
girls into an office building

01:15:23.213 --> 01:15:25.871
and they locked her
into the elevator shaft.

01:15:27.355 --> 01:15:29.288
Her name was Allie McCormack.

01:15:29.288 --> 01:15:31.324
Come on, guys.
Guys?!

01:15:31.324 --> 01:15:33.119
They said they'd come
back in an hour to get her,

01:15:33.119 --> 01:15:36.226
but apparently, they went back
to the sorority house,

01:15:36.226 --> 01:15:39.091
got drunk, and forgot about her.

01:15:39.091 --> 01:15:40.644
Let me out!

01:15:40.644 --> 01:15:43.613
She spent
the entire weekend all alone,

01:15:43.613 --> 01:15:44.752
slowly losing her mind.

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:49.584
That Monday when people
started coming in for work,

01:15:49.584 --> 01:15:52.276
she was still down there.

01:15:52.276 --> 01:15:56.971
She was crushed by the elevator,
causing her spine to shatter.

01:15:56.971 --> 01:15:59.145
But that isn't what killed her.

01:15:59.145 --> 01:16:00.871
According to the coroner,

01:16:00.871 --> 01:16:04.116
she eventually got twisted up
in the elevator gears

01:16:04.116 --> 01:16:07.291
and was very slowly
ripped apart.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.647
They didn't find her body
until several days later.

01:16:23.273 --> 01:16:26.276
So, she's a vengeance spirit.

01:16:27.173 --> 01:16:30.176
No, Matty, she's a poor, dead
girl from a few decades ago.

01:16:30.176 --> 01:16:32.834
And you scared yourself
into thinking this is all real.

01:16:32.834 --> 01:16:35.250
All these years of doing this
and you still don't believe it?

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:37.114
Because it's never fucking real!

01:16:37.114 --> 01:16:38.944
It's all stories people made up

01:16:38.944 --> 01:16:41.878
because they're afraid of
the finality of their own death.

01:16:43.776 --> 01:16:45.916
That was dark.

01:16:45.916 --> 01:16:47.435
Okay.

01:16:47.435 --> 01:16:50.611
Listen, guys.

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:54.200
Let's just say
that this is real...

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.892
'cause it is.

01:16:57.928 --> 01:17:00.137
What do we do about it?

01:17:02.346 --> 01:17:03.762
Uh...

01:17:05.695 --> 01:17:06.937
I...

01:17:08.421 --> 01:17:10.147
...don't know.

01:17:14.048 --> 01:17:15.463
Look, I've been
searching online,

01:17:15.463 --> 01:17:17.189
but anything I can find
on the rules

01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:19.087
tells me how to open the door,
just not how to close it.

01:17:19.087 --> 01:17:21.089
I'm giving this
five more minutes

01:17:21.089 --> 01:17:23.229
and then I'm going
to the police.

01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:25.956
Fine. I've got
a few more sources to check.

01:17:30.133 --> 01:17:31.928
I can't believe I'm letting
this lunacy play out.

01:17:31.928 --> 01:17:33.170
You saw what was on that camera.

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:34.862
It doesn't mean that they--

01:17:41.075 --> 01:17:42.904
What is that song?

01:17:42.904 --> 01:17:44.837
Hmm?

01:17:44.837 --> 01:17:46.114
What song?

01:17:46.114 --> 01:17:49.083
You were just humming a song.

01:17:51.085 --> 01:17:52.811
Yeah, I guess I was.

01:17:52.811 --> 01:17:54.951
Um, I don't know,
probably heard it somewhere.

01:17:54.951 --> 01:17:56.918
Pretty catchy.

01:17:56.918 --> 01:17:59.024
I heard it, too,
when I was there.

01:17:59.024 --> 01:18:01.371
She was humming it.

01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:02.475
It's...

01:18:02.475 --> 01:18:05.099
Ugh, it's really familiar.

01:18:06.514 --> 01:18:10.311
♪ The elevator goes up

01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:14.315
♪ Comes back down and then

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:16.144
The elevator song.

01:18:16.144 --> 01:18:18.388
It's a nursery rhyme
my mom used to sing.

01:18:18.388 --> 01:18:19.976
You've heard it before, right?

01:18:19.976 --> 01:18:21.287
No.

01:18:21.287 --> 01:18:22.737
My mom didn't sing
nursery rhymes.

01:18:22.737 --> 01:18:25.395
She mostly cursed
and threw things.

01:18:25.395 --> 01:18:28.467
♪ The elevator goes up

01:18:28.467 --> 01:18:30.469
♪ Comes back down and then

01:18:30.469 --> 01:18:33.506
♪ The doors open,
the doors close ♪

01:18:33.506 --> 01:18:36.475
- ♪ Let's all ride again
- That's what she was humming.

01:18:36.475 --> 01:18:38.822
It's just a kids' song.
I'm sure you've heard it before.

01:18:38.822 --> 01:18:40.997
Uh, sorry.

01:18:40.997 --> 01:18:43.275
The doors close.

01:18:44.103 --> 01:18:46.485
A-And then we ride again.

01:18:46.485 --> 01:18:49.868
We-- We didn't finish the game.

01:18:51.524 --> 01:18:52.940
We never finished.

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.355
We have to--
We have to play again.

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:56.564
We have to step out
into her world.

01:18:56.564 --> 01:18:58.808
And then we ride again.

01:18:58.808 --> 01:19:00.292
That's how we close the door!

01:19:00.292 --> 01:19:02.018
- Yes!
- That's it!

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:05.055
Yes!

01:19:05.055 --> 01:19:06.470
What are you doing?

01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:08.403
- I'm calling the police.

01:19:08.403 --> 01:19:11.234
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, uh, we need a plan.

01:19:11.234 --> 01:19:12.856
We have to step back
into the elevator

01:19:12.856 --> 01:19:14.133
and we have to play again.

01:19:14.133 --> 01:19:15.583
Right, right, right,
and then, uh...

01:19:15.583 --> 01:19:18.241
Chloe, you can stop humming.
We got it. Um...

01:19:21.071 --> 01:19:22.797
That's not me.

01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:33.566
Hello?

01:19:33.566 --> 01:19:36.362
Yeah, just call the monster
right over to us, why don't you?

01:19:38.364 --> 01:19:40.159
Chloe, step back
into the circle.

01:19:40.159 --> 01:19:42.403
Chloe.
Chloe!

01:19:52.447 --> 01:19:53.932
Allie?

01:19:56.589 --> 01:19:59.247
Okay, that's good.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.424
That's good.

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:16.023
Maybe she goes by Alice.

01:20:16.023 --> 01:20:17.231
Is the salt ring gonna work?

01:20:17.231 --> 01:20:18.888
According to what I've read.

01:20:22.305 --> 01:20:23.444
P-Please work.

01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:31.970
Oh, fuck.

01:20:51.161 --> 01:20:52.611
Okay.

01:20:52.611 --> 01:20:54.544
Okay, t-this is perfect.

01:20:54.544 --> 01:20:56.477
S-S-She--
She can't get through.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:57.478
Matty.

01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:59.031
Can you?!

01:20:59.031 --> 01:21:00.274
Matty.

01:21:00.274 --> 01:21:01.896
No, I'm telling you guys,

01:21:01.896 --> 01:21:03.346
the Internet does not lie
about these things.

01:21:03.346 --> 01:21:05.210
- Matty, no!

01:21:09.179 --> 01:21:10.594
Matty!

01:21:23.953 --> 01:21:27.266
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

01:21:29.613 --> 01:21:31.650
- Run, run!
- Okay, okay.

01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:50.462
Go, go, go!

01:22:01.473 --> 01:22:02.715
Come on.
Come on.

01:22:02.715 --> 01:22:05.063
Come on, come on, come on.

01:22:06.305 --> 01:22:08.929
Come on, come on.

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:11.310
I thought I told you kids
not to come back here.

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:13.140
- No, we have to just get up--
- I don't want to hear it.

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:14.348
Get your asses
out of the building.

01:22:16.039 --> 01:22:18.731
I'm not messing around.
Let's go!

01:22:18.731 --> 01:22:20.285
- Come on! Let's go.
- Fine.

01:22:20.285 --> 01:22:22.045
Fine, fine.

01:22:22.045 --> 01:22:25.738
- Chloe.
- It's-- It's over, Ryan.

01:22:25.738 --> 01:22:27.430
We'll-- We'll get out. Okay.

01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:29.984
Okay.
Smart choice.

01:22:31.779 --> 01:22:33.505
- No, we're not leaving.
- Okay, you know what?

01:22:33.505 --> 01:22:35.300
I've given you this chance
once already.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.681
- I'm calling the cops.

01:22:37.681 --> 01:22:40.132
- Oh!
- Sorry, I'm so sorry!

01:22:40.132 --> 01:22:41.478
I'm so, so sorry!
Sorry!

01:22:41.478 --> 01:22:43.998
- Oh, my God.

01:22:48.761 --> 01:22:51.109
So, you really did have mace.

01:22:51.109 --> 01:22:52.489
Of course, I did.

01:23:05.468 --> 01:23:07.470
What if it doesn't work?

01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:08.678
It's gotta work.

01:23:13.131 --> 01:23:14.201
Okay.

01:23:15.547 --> 01:23:17.583
Up until 15 minutes ago,

01:23:17.583 --> 01:23:20.793
I didn't have a shred of faith
at any of this ever being real.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.213
Now all I have is faith in
the fact that this has to work.

01:23:34.393 --> 01:23:37.362
All we have to do
is follow her rules.

01:23:37.362 --> 01:23:40.641
If we do that, we'll be fine.

01:24:00.419 --> 01:24:01.455
Listen.

01:24:02.697 --> 01:24:05.390
If it doesn't work,
we run like hell.

01:24:06.253 --> 01:24:07.737
And we don't look back.

01:24:07.737 --> 01:24:09.566
Ever, Chloe.

01:24:10.878 --> 01:24:15.641
We find a way to break this
curse or a way to kill her.

01:24:18.437 --> 01:24:20.681
But this is gonna work.

01:24:21.716 --> 01:24:23.615
- Yeah.

01:24:26.721 --> 01:24:28.102
Wait.

01:24:31.899 --> 01:24:34.108
We're about to invite her
in here with us.

01:24:37.284 --> 01:24:38.423
I know.

01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:46.569
Hey.

01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:53.714
Remember, don't look at her,

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:57.097
don't speak to her,
no matter what.

01:24:57.959 --> 01:25:00.100
- Okay?
Okay.

01:25:09.799 --> 01:25:13.182
Don't look, don't look.

01:25:30.509 --> 01:25:32.408
Don't look, don't look.

01:25:38.276 --> 01:25:40.519
Close. Close.

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:54.464
Okay.
Okay, okay, do it.

01:25:59.711 --> 01:26:01.299
It worked.

01:26:02.369 --> 01:26:04.509
- Okay.
- It's working.

01:26:36.886 --> 01:26:38.681
This place...

01:26:41.028 --> 01:26:43.341
...it's real.

01:26:43.341 --> 01:26:45.446
All of it...

01:26:45.446 --> 01:26:47.241
real.

01:26:52.522 --> 01:26:54.421
Ryan, come on.

01:26:55.387 --> 01:26:56.285
Ryan!

01:26:57.665 --> 01:27:02.256
Ryan, we need to go, please?

01:27:02.981 --> 01:27:04.327
It's her.

01:27:05.673 --> 01:27:06.916
It's Becki.

01:27:12.301 --> 01:27:13.440
Ryan, come on.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.304
I knew I'd find you here.

01:27:15.304 --> 01:27:16.753
No, it's a trick.

01:27:16.753 --> 01:27:18.376
Please?

01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:23.622
Ryan, Becki's gone.

01:27:23.622 --> 01:27:26.832
I know it hurts, okay?
But she's gone.

01:27:29.318 --> 01:27:32.528
I'm scared.
Please, let's go.

01:27:38.844 --> 01:27:41.744
So, we just go back
to one now, right?

01:27:41.744 --> 01:27:44.402
And it's all over?

01:27:44.402 --> 01:27:45.851
Yeah.

01:27:45.851 --> 01:27:47.715
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:28:05.112 --> 01:28:07.459
Why are we stopping on five?

01:28:09.392 --> 01:28:10.704
She's not going to give up.

01:28:10.704 --> 01:28:12.809
- What?
- She's not going to let us go.

01:28:14.155 --> 01:28:15.743
Close your eyes.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.313
- Is she here?
Yeah.

01:28:59.511 --> 01:29:01.651
Where are you going?

01:29:01.651 --> 01:29:03.895
Chloe, don't.

01:29:12.421 --> 01:29:14.146
Don't leave me, Ryan.

01:29:14.146 --> 01:29:15.976
I'm so scared here.

01:29:36.824 --> 01:29:38.067
Ryan?

01:29:58.984 --> 01:30:01.435
Hey, girlies, guess what.

01:30:01.435 --> 01:30:02.850
I finally found it.

01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:05.888
I found the actual elevator
from the story.

01:30:05.888 --> 01:30:07.614
Okay, so Chloe Young
and her friends

01:30:07.614 --> 01:30:08.891
all played the elevator game

01:30:08.891 --> 01:30:10.824
before they disappeared
a few years ago.

01:30:10.824 --> 01:30:13.930
Now, rumor has it the police
just never found their bodies.

01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:16.968
Or did the Fifth-Floor Woman
take them?

01:30:18.521 --> 01:30:20.558
So, guess what I'm gonna do.

01:30:20.558 --> 01:30:24.803
I'm gonna play the elevator game
in this very elevator.

01:30:24.803 --> 01:30:30.015
Okay, Internet, who's ready
to meet the Fifth-Floor Woman?

01:30:30.015 --> 01:30:31.085
