Laura.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.985
-Are you in there?

01:08.027 --> 01:10.237
Laura.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.364
-Hey, open the door!

01:12.406 --> 01:15.868
-Laura, open the door,
seriously!

01:17.912 --> 01:19.371
What are you doing in there?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.043
I'm not playing with you,
come on!

You know, here's
what I'm thinking.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.583
What if we just, like,
took a break?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.460
You've been working
at this like all day.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.213
I've just been staring at that
for the past five hours.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.298
But there's really
good light today.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.425
There's really good light
every day, it's the sun.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.053
It's gonna be up there tomorrow,
I promise you.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.471
I'm literally dying out here.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.640
Maybe you can paint
a picture of me dying.

02:19.682 --> 02:21.725
Is that a little bleak for you?
I don't know.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.810
-Okay.
-Yeah?

02:22.852 --> 02:24.812
Let's take a break.

02:24.854 --> 02:28.649
Gosh, thank goodness.
I am so ready
to get out of here.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.109
Let's go to Lost & Found.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.236
Isn't that that
janky old record store?

02:32.278 --> 02:34.154
"Janky" is a strong word.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.742
-Chloe.
-Hmm?

02:38.784 --> 02:40.744
Doesn't your brother
work at a record store?

02:40.786 --> 02:43.622
Yeah. So?

02:43.664 --> 02:46.709
That's why you want me
to go there, you're trying
to set me up with your brother.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.043
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are!

02:48.085 --> 02:49.628
I'm not, I swear.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.176
Let's go.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.061
-Come on.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.943
-Harrison.
-Thank you, man.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.236
-Yo.
-Yo, what's up?

03:14.278 --> 03:16.655
-Hello. Nice shirt.
-Thanks.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.702
Uh, I have a little
surprise for you.

03:21.744 --> 03:24.955
Laura, this is
my stepbrother Harrison.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.373
All righties.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.668
-I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
-Hi.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.171
"Hi"? That's how you're
gonna start this whole thing?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.680
Are those cassettes over there?

03:41.722 --> 03:46.352
Yeah.
Those are all actual mixtapes
that people have given us.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.145
Why would they give them up?

03:48.187 --> 03:50.356
Sometimes people
will put their mixtapes in

03:50.397 --> 03:52.316
with their boxes
of other music stuff,

03:52.358 --> 03:54.652
and then,
when they sell those boxes,

03:54.693 --> 03:56.946
the tapes end up here
without a home.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.697
It's kind of sad
that they lose them.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.658
I think that's why my boss
started the wall.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.535
If there's even a possibility
that one of these can
get reunited,

04:03.577 --> 04:06.538
they stand a much better chance
up on the wall then...

04:06.580 --> 04:10.668
in a trash can
or landfill somewhere.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.170
-Lost & Found.
-Mm-hmm.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.130
That's clever.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.966
-I'll tell him you said that.
-Okay.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.598
What, Japanese Breakfast?
I can't believe you guys
have this.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.267
Ooh, yeah, neither can I.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.311
You don't like them?

04:29.353 --> 04:31.480
No, I like them. I like them.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.566
-This is such a good album.
-That is a very good album.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.443
Um, it has a very unique sound.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.570
-Oh, my God, you hate them.
-No, no.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.073
No, they sound
slapped together sometimes.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.908
-Ow! Stop!
-Becky just texted me.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.493
Lei Lei-- Can you not?

04:44.535 --> 04:46.537
Lei Lei's is doing
karaoke night,

04:46.578 --> 04:48.038
so I'm gonna do some Cardi.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.873
-I think you should.
-Yeah.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.917
Um, yeah, I'll just...

04:51.959 --> 04:54.503
I'll meet you outside
in a second.

04:57.423 --> 04:58.924
Oh.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.592
Okay.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.096
Stop, stop, stop.

05:04.138 --> 05:07.433
Um... I'm going
to their show next week.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.809
Really?

05:08.851 --> 05:11.687
I'm not gonna give you my number
unless you go with me.

05:11.729 --> 05:15.024
Unless I go with you
to the Japanese Breakfast show?

05:15.065 --> 05:16.275
Yes, that one.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.318
-Do you have a pen?
-Yeah.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.112
-Do you want a pen?
-I would love one.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.075
There we go.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.286
Oh, no, nope.
You can't...

05:27.327 --> 05:28.704
can't do that.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.874
O...kay.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.920
There we go.

05:38.547 --> 05:39.757
It's for you.

05:39.798 --> 05:40.883
Okay.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.137
I guess I have to buy this now?

05:47.056 --> 05:48.307
I guess you do.

Well, I'm really glad
that you changed your mind.

07:30.659 --> 07:34.705
Why do you
like records so much
when streaming is so easy?

07:34.746 --> 07:37.624
With records and tapes,
you have this tangible thing,

07:37.666 --> 07:39.126
right there in front of you.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.629

you get to flip it.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.131
I love that.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.925
With streaming, they just
bunch it all together and...

07:48.635 --> 07:50.304
the original is lost.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.225
What?

07:56.310 --> 07:57.436
Nothing.

07:59.605 --> 08:02.024
I have something for you.

Medical Biochemistry?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.693
No, the tape.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.404
The book was a present
from my dad.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.990
Light reading.

08:10.032 --> 08:13.410
Yep. Growing up
a doctor's son, no pressure.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.870
Good morning.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.915
I don't suppose you plan
on doing any work back here.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.834
-Nope.
-Just don't break anything.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.295
Coop, all this stuff
is broken anyway.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.089
Just because it's broken
doesn't mean it's busted.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.716
I'm not just collecting parts.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.718
There's nothing here
that I can't fix.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.220
I know.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.889
-Oh, Cooper.
-Laura.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.391
Oh, that kid's smarter
than he looks,

08:36.433 --> 08:39.853
so... or is it that he looks
smarter than he is?

08:42.231 --> 08:44.149
Guess the jury's
still out on that.

08:45.609 --> 08:46.818
Nice meeting you.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.195
You too.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.492
All right, you wanna put
that cassette in here?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.496
Okay.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.332
-This way?
-Mm-hmm.

09:04.253 --> 09:07.506
All right, see that red
recording button?

09:09.675 --> 09:11.176
-This one?
-Mm-hmm.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.679
Press it.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.437

09:50.757 --> 09:53.593
-You sure?
-Yes, yes.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.222
But I'm not coordinated.
I have like zero balance. Zero.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.267
That is precisely why
I wanna take you.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.394
I think seeing you wipe out
a thousand times

10:02.436 --> 10:05.272
could be sort of... fun.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.398

-Yeah.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.482

-Yeah.

Ow!

10:09.234 --> 10:11.320
-Are you kidding me?
Don't make me...
-Ow!

10:11.361 --> 10:12.696
Don't do that!

10:12.738 --> 10:14.531
-Stop! Stop.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.825
-Stop, stop, stop.
-I am so sorry, I'm done.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.498
Hello, this is Laura.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.461
Really?

10:27.502 --> 10:30.213
-I mean, that's fantastic.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.425
Thank you so much.
That sounds great.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.760
Bye.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.303
What was that?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.639
The Walsh Art Mentorship.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.810
Um... I got in.

10:43.852 --> 10:44.895
What?

10:44.936 --> 10:46.313
-Yeah.
-That's amazing.

10:46.355 --> 10:47.814
Have you heard of it?

10:47.856 --> 10:50.817
No, but a mentorship,
that sounds huge!

10:50.859 --> 10:53.362
All the students have gone on
to do amazing things, like...

10:53.403 --> 10:56.365
huge gallery exhibits
and commissioned private work

10:56.406 --> 10:58.658
and public murals, and I...

10:58.700 --> 11:00.702

11:15.634 --> 11:19.137

I don't wanna go to the beach.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.895

-You can just tell me if you
don't wanna hang out with me.

-No, that's not
what I'm saying.
-It's fine.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.485

34:15.179 --> 34:17.848
-What... What's happening?
-Is this real?

34:17.890 --> 34:20.100
I don't know
how this is happening.

34:20.142 --> 34:22.186
-How am I here?
-What are you talking about?

34:22.227 --> 34:23.687
You're alive!

34:23.729 --> 34:26.440
Oh, shit,
did you take something?

34:26.482 --> 34:28.567
-No.
-Was it ecstasy?

34:28.609 --> 34:30.861
No, no, I didn't take anything.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.529
I... I...

34:32.571 --> 34:35.783
Okay, well, then someone
definitely slipped
something in your drink.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.910
-You had a beer?
-I'm not on drugs, okay?

34:37.951 --> 34:39.286
-But...
-Okay.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.914
Well, maybe... you wanna
go to the bathroom,

34:41.955 --> 34:44.374
maybe splash some
cold water on your face?

34:44.416 --> 34:46.043
-Yeah.
-Okay.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.670
-I'll just stay here?
-No, I'm not going
anywhere without you.

34:48.712 --> 34:49.797
Oh, oh!

34:57.596 --> 34:59.056
I'm dreaming,
I'm dreaming.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.390
This has to be a dream.

35:00.432 --> 35:04.394
I... I was just sitting
in my room and then...

35:04.436 --> 35:06.146
and, um...
my God, you're real.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.607
Why don't you-- let's put
some cold water on your face.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.818
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm, uh...

35:10.859 --> 35:13.070
Well, how, um, is this...

35:13.111 --> 35:15.781
-I really think somebody
put something in your drink.
-I don't think so.

35:15.823 --> 35:17.449
-Okay, yep, time to go.

35:17.491 --> 35:20.536
-We're going now? All right.
-Excuse us. Sorry.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.872
Um... wait, I, uh...

35:23.914 --> 35:25.541
Do you wanna go to Urgent Care?

35:25.582 --> 35:26.708
-No.
-Really?

35:26.750 --> 35:28.710
-Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

35:28.752 --> 35:31.296
I just... can we get outta here?

35:31.338 --> 35:33.340
'Cause I really need
to talk to you and it's...

35:33.382 --> 35:35.759
-...a little loud in here,
and, I, um...

35:35.801 --> 35:38.428
Yeah, hey, absolutely...

36:12.254 --> 36:14.882
-What?
-Oh, my God,
this is actually happening.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.425
-What?

36:16.466 --> 36:17.968
Uh...

36:18.010 --> 36:19.303
Laura, where are you...?

36:19.344 --> 36:20.888
How is this happening?

36:20.929 --> 36:23.307
How is this happening?

36:23.348 --> 36:25.350
How is this...
How is this happening?

36:25.392 --> 36:28.270
Did I do something wrong?

36:28.312 --> 36:31.315
Hey, are we moving too fast?
I feel like maybe we're
moving too fast.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.900
No, no, we're not,
it's not that.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.401
-It's, um...
-What?

36:36.194 --> 36:38.488
-You're gonna think I'm crazy.
-No, no, I won't.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.198
-Um...
-What?

36:40.240 --> 36:41.742
I'm from the future.

36:44.995 --> 36:46.246
Like, like...

36:46.288 --> 36:47.581
hoverboard future

36:47.623 --> 36:50.542
or "buried Statue of Liberty
on the beach" future?

36:50.584 --> 36:52.294
Wait, are we still together?

36:52.336 --> 36:54.796
Eh, feel like that might be
a little too presumptuous.

36:54.838 --> 36:57.257
-Is that maybe...
-Harrison, I'm not kidding.

36:57.299 --> 36:58.425
You're gonna die.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.052
Yeah, okay.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.596
No, listen to me, it happens
the day after your birthday.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.556
You go-- you go surfing

37:04.598 --> 37:06.266
and...

37:06.308 --> 37:07.601
you, um...

37:07.643 --> 37:09.937
Are you...
are you being serious?

37:09.978 --> 37:12.981
Are you... are you saying that
you had a dream that I died?

37:13.023 --> 37:15.776
No, it already hap--
It's going to happen.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.320
What do you-- what do you mean,
it already happened?

37:18.362 --> 37:19.947
You die on September 25th.

37:19.988 --> 37:23.075
You get hit by a car
crossing the road
to go surf that morning.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.119
Okay, this...

37:26.161 --> 37:27.829
this joke is getting too real.

37:27.871 --> 37:30.290
Do you remember
that night of the concert
when I freaked out?

37:30.332 --> 37:32.834
Yeah. You said you didn't
remember anything that happened.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.253
I did?

37:35.295 --> 37:37.339
-Stop, stop.
-I did?

37:37.381 --> 37:39.341
No, that's...

37:39.383 --> 37:40.884
Look, I'm telling the truth.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.387
Harrison, I'm from the future
and you have to promise me...

37:43.428 --> 37:45.347
you have to promise me
that you don't go back there.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.307
-No, come on.
-Harrison, I need you
to believe me.

37:47.349 --> 37:50.477
To believe you?
To believe that you've come
back in time in your own body

37:50.519 --> 37:53.021
to tell me that I'm gonna die?

37:53.063 --> 37:54.314
Yes!

37:54.356 --> 37:56.525
Think about how that sounds.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.487
Really bad, really bad.

38:00.529 --> 38:01.989
Really...

38:02.030 --> 38:03.740
Laura, are you--
I feel like maybe--

38:03.782 --> 38:05.826
Oh, oh, hey, there's
gonna be an earthquake.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.203
-What do you mean?
-I mean I'm predicting
the future.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.496
Okay, when?

38:09.538 --> 38:11.081
Now.

38:16.003 --> 38:17.295
Wait for it.

38:19.506 --> 38:20.841
Any second now.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.512
Laura, I'm gonna take you home.

38:25.554 --> 38:28.473
No. No,
it's like surfing on land.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.517
That's what you told me.

38:37.816 --> 38:42.654
Oh, my God.
How did you--

38:57.794 --> 38:59.379
Hey.

38:59.421 --> 39:03.050
Hey. Is everything okay?
You said it was an emergency?

39:05.469 --> 39:06.928
Laura. Hey!

39:06.970 --> 39:08.972
What is it?

39:09.014 --> 39:11.516
I don't really know how
to say this without sounding...

39:12.934 --> 39:14.061
crazy.

39:15.645 --> 39:16.938
But, um...

39:16.980 --> 39:19.066
I can travel through time.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.738
Come on, Laura,
you said that it was serious.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.656
I'm being serious.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.159
Okay, uh...

39:29.201 --> 39:30.744
Right, um...

39:30.786 --> 39:32.579
So, where is your time machine?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.838
I made a timeline.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.632
So if the tape
only goes forward,

39:43.673 --> 39:45.217
that's only five more songs.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.636
That's only five more chances
to save him.

39:47.677 --> 39:50.388
So you said
that you told Harrison

39:50.430 --> 39:54.059
the date that he was gonna die
and how it happened, right?

39:54.101 --> 39:56.520
Yeah.

39:59.481 --> 40:02.192
Then why isn't he here? Laura?

40:03.652 --> 40:04.861
I don't know.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.450
At my wedding...

40:10.492 --> 40:13.203
I know you made up all that
stuff about having a boyfriend.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.663
Chloe, I'm not making this up.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.998
You're telling me
that you traveled through time.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.834
I did, I was there,
I saw him, we spoke,

40:18.875 --> 40:20.752
and he was just
as confused as I was and...

40:20.794 --> 40:22.671
Are you... are you
hearing what you're saying?

40:22.712 --> 40:24.464
Think about the things
that you're telling me.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.091
I know it sounds crazy,
but I have...

40:26.133 --> 40:28.593
I have no other
explanation, Chloe.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.220
I talked to him!

40:30.262 --> 40:31.638
Okay? I touched him.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.557
He's alive.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.018
And I can prove it to you.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.063
I can...

40:41.773 --> 40:42.899
Put these in.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.485
Please.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.576
I'm gonna play the next song.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.786
You're gonna feel a rush,
and then you're there.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.246
It's a little disorienting.

40:57.497 --> 41:00.917
-You ready?
-Yep.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.043
All right.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.401
Nothing's happening.

41:29.571 --> 41:31.573
This is the wrong song.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.742
I wonder why this song is...

41:33.783 --> 41:35.869
-We never heard this together.
-Hey, babe.

41:35.911 --> 41:39.080
-Maybe we can just sit and talk.
-Where's my travel kit?

41:39.122 --> 41:40.707
Uh, I would--

41:40.749 --> 41:42.250
Did you check
the bedroom closet?

41:42.292 --> 41:44.169
-Yes, you must have moved it.
-I didn't touch it.

41:44.211 --> 41:45.712
Well, it isn't
where I left it.

41:45.754 --> 41:47.547
Well, I don't really know
what to tell you.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.925
I keep things
in specific places
for a reason, Chloe.

41:49.966 --> 41:53.220
Can't you just, like,
maybe go to the airport
and buy a new one?

41:53.261 --> 41:54.638
Oh.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.097
-Okay.
-What?

41:56.139 --> 41:57.933
Look, I'm sorry,
maybe under the bed.

41:59.976 --> 42:03.271
Chloe, where is Jason?

42:04.814 --> 42:05.899
Jason?

42:05.941 --> 42:08.109
Uh, who is Jason?

42:10.070 --> 42:11.988
Hey, no, it's okay.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.740
Where are you going?

42:14.783 --> 42:15.909
Laura?

43:49.586 --> 43:52.380
Laura, I love it.

43:58.136 --> 43:59.179
Are you okay?

43:59.220 --> 44:01.139
It's me.

44:03.308 --> 44:05.060
You believed me.

44:05.101 --> 44:07.520
-What?
-You stayed away from the beach.

44:07.562 --> 44:08.855
You believed me.

44:11.524 --> 44:13.735
Please, just talk to me.
Say something.

44:13.777 --> 44:16.529
I-- I...
No, I thought you were crazy.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.531
Laura, I...
I thought I was crazy.

44:18.573 --> 44:20.825
You denied everything
seconds later.

44:20.867 --> 44:23.661
But the more I thought about it,
I mean the earthquake...

44:25.955 --> 44:27.582
How is this even possible?

44:27.624 --> 44:29.292
I-I don't know,
but it's happening,

44:29.334 --> 44:31.378
and every time I play
a song on the mixtape,

44:31.419 --> 44:33.380
the one we're making,
it takes me back in time

44:33.421 --> 44:35.423
to the moment
we first heard it together.

44:35.465 --> 44:37.759
We have a chance
to change what happens to you,

44:37.801 --> 44:39.552
a chance to save you.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.847
Wait, but there's a song
on the mixtape that you
didn't come back for.

44:42.889 --> 44:45.183
Yeah, but you and me, we never
went to the beach together,

44:45.225 --> 44:48.353
so now the Laura that you know
has a completely different
memory than me.

44:48.395 --> 44:51.564
That changed the tape.
We have to be careful.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.483
I don't know how much time
we have left.

44:53.525 --> 44:55.777
When the song ends,
it's gonna send me back.

44:55.819 --> 44:59.322
Okay, so I'll just change
the things that happen
on the day that I die.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.658
Yeah.

45:03.284 --> 45:04.702
How does it happen?

45:06.955 --> 45:08.289
Okay, so, um...

45:08.331 --> 45:10.875
you fall from Sunset Cliffs,
but that's far from now.

45:10.917 --> 45:13.503
So just... stay away
from there on the day.

45:13.545 --> 45:16.756
-Okay.
-Stay away from the beach
and the cliffs.

45:16.798 --> 45:18.133
Okay.

45:19.592 --> 45:21.010
You think that'll do it?

45:24.681 --> 45:26.850
Laura?

45:26.891 --> 45:29.394
Hey, we're gonna fix this.

45:30.645 --> 45:31.688
We're gonna fix this.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.189
-Yeah. Yeah.
-We're gonna make it work.

45:33.231 --> 45:35.525
♪ ...before they fade ♪

46:22.155 --> 46:25.116
Hey, YouTubers,
here's how you manually
rewind a cassette tape.

46:25.158 --> 46:28.369
You get a pencil like this,
or a pen as well,

46:28.411 --> 46:32.665
and you put it in like that
so it catches the gears
inside the tape

46:32.707 --> 46:35.710
and you wind it back,
you want to wind it back...

46:35.752 --> 46:39.506
Einstein's equations
do allow for time travel.

46:39.547 --> 46:41.674
For example,
gigantic spinning cylinders,

46:41.716 --> 46:45.261
you can go around a cylinder,
and you come back
before you left.

47:15.208 --> 47:16.334
It's me.

47:17.919 --> 47:19.754
We didn't fix it, did we?

47:19.796 --> 47:20.838
No, not yet.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.924
But, um, I've been doing
some research,

47:22.966 --> 47:25.885
but I haven't found
anything that specifically
fits our situation.

47:25.927 --> 47:27.637
-Have you?
-No.

47:29.264 --> 47:32.308
So, I didn't mention it
before, but, um...

47:32.350 --> 47:34.394
we changed something
with Chloe.

47:34.435 --> 47:37.397
With Chloe, what?
What happens to Chloe?

47:39.274 --> 47:40.817
She ends up with him.

47:45.196 --> 47:47.615
No, focus, okay?
It's not gonna fix anything.

47:47.657 --> 47:50.410
Just let's save you first,
we can worry about her after.

47:50.451 --> 47:53.246
Okay. So, if I'm still dead...

47:53.288 --> 47:55.790
...how do I die now?

47:55.832 --> 47:58.918
What should I avoid?

48:00.545 --> 48:03.256
Laura?

48:04.340 --> 48:06.342
Are you okay?

48:06.384 --> 48:08.928
You don't look so good.

48:08.970 --> 48:11.055
Har...ri...son.

48:57.060 --> 48:59.896
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

49:43.147 --> 49:45.525
Excuse me. Hi, sorry.

49:45.566 --> 49:48.778
Um, do you know what happened
to Lost & Found?

49:48.820 --> 49:50.780
The record store
that used to be here.

49:50.822 --> 49:53.741
Oh, honey, have you
been away for a while?

49:53.783 --> 49:56.703
A fire burnt out the interior
a few years ago.

49:56.744 --> 49:59.497
We've been here
about three years now.

49:59.539 --> 50:01.666
Do you know what happened
to the owner?

50:28.401 --> 50:29.485
Yeah.

50:30.737 --> 50:31.946
Hi.

50:49.464 --> 50:52.550
I was just gonna
make myself a drink.

50:52.592 --> 50:55.344
-Want one?
-No, I'm okay.

51:20.411 --> 51:21.621
Um...

51:21.662 --> 51:24.081
so happy you were able
to save these.

51:24.123 --> 51:26.292
Uh, do they still play?

51:26.334 --> 51:29.921
Would you prefer I ignored
that you were looking
through my stuff?

51:31.339 --> 51:32.590
What are you doing here,

51:32.632 --> 51:36.677
if not to apologize
for the fire?

51:36.719 --> 51:39.555
Or not showing up
for the past four years.

51:41.724 --> 51:44.060
I was looking for something.

51:44.101 --> 51:46.354
Yeah. So I see.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.397
Do you remember that mixtape

51:48.439 --> 51:50.274
that Harrison and I
were making together?

51:51.734 --> 51:52.902
Yeah.

51:52.944 --> 51:55.947
Have you seen it anywhere?

51:55.988 --> 51:58.032
What you see is what's left.

51:58.074 --> 52:00.159
Well, you know,
it wasn't on the wall though,

52:00.201 --> 52:02.370
so maybe it could be
somewhere else here, right?

52:02.411 --> 52:04.914
Like in one
of these boxes, maybe?

52:04.956 --> 52:07.416
No, nothing in those boxes.

52:10.962 --> 52:13.506
The Knotts did return
a bunch of stuff

52:13.548 --> 52:16.968
that Harrison "borrowed"
from the store.

52:19.929 --> 52:21.138
That kid.

52:23.850 --> 52:25.852
Uh, let me look back here.

52:25.893 --> 52:27.937
Just give me a second, okay?

52:27.979 --> 52:29.146
Yeah.

52:48.541 --> 52:49.667
This it?

52:52.086 --> 52:53.880
Yes! Thank you.

52:53.921 --> 52:55.590
Thank you. Um...

52:55.631 --> 52:58.259
You know what, I think I will
take that drink now, actually.

52:58.301 --> 53:00.344
Uh, rum and Coke okay?

53:00.386 --> 53:01.721
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

53:32.126 --> 53:34.754
I hope this is
enough ice.

53:39.008 --> 53:41.802
-Something wrong?
-It's not working.
It was working before. I...

53:41.844 --> 53:43.512
Here, let me
take a look at it.

53:51.854 --> 53:53.397
How old are these batteries?

53:55.524 --> 53:57.443
Always the simplest thing.

54:02.823 --> 54:04.116
There.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.580
Whoa.

54:14.919 --> 54:16.545
Oh, it can't rewind.

54:24.053 --> 54:25.888
Hmm.

54:25.930 --> 54:27.932
Let me try something. Here.

54:33.729 --> 54:36.816
Hmm. Doesn't seem
to rewind here either.

54:38.109 --> 54:40.361
-Huh.

54:40.403 --> 54:41.529
Yeah.

54:41.570 --> 54:43.572
At least we know it plays.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.704
You okay?

55:03.801 --> 55:05.928
So, after
everything slowed down,

55:05.970 --> 55:08.431
the music stopped
and I came here.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.850
And that's basically
where I'm at.

55:12.351 --> 55:14.103
So you believe me?

55:14.145 --> 55:16.313
Uh, I've heard people say

55:16.355 --> 55:18.482
that music transcends
space and time,

55:18.524 --> 55:22.361
but I've always thought it was
just a, uh, a metaphor.

55:22.403 --> 55:24.155
Yeah.

55:25.364 --> 55:27.742
-Here.
-No, I'm okay.

55:27.783 --> 55:30.036
Anyone else know?

55:30.077 --> 55:33.039
I tried to tell Chloe but she
just thought I was losing it,

55:33.080 --> 55:34.248
so...

55:34.290 --> 55:36.542
You saying that
she saw you disappear?

55:36.584 --> 55:38.669
And did she say
anything about it?

55:38.711 --> 55:42.256
No, I tried to have her listen
to see if it would send her
back, but it didn't work,

55:42.298 --> 55:45.217
and when I tried,
nothing happened because
it was the wrong song,

55:45.259 --> 55:47.511
a song I didn't remember.

55:47.553 --> 55:48.721
Uh-huh.

55:48.763 --> 55:50.222
Nothing happened to me

55:50.264 --> 55:55.061
with... I presume,
one of the right songs.

55:55.102 --> 55:57.730
Well, I guess
it seems that it's...

55:57.772 --> 55:59.148
it's you.

55:59.190 --> 56:01.067
That's what I was thinking.

56:01.108 --> 56:03.986
I'm just burning through
my chances to save him

56:04.028 --> 56:07.073
and I can't buy myself
more time because
I can't rewind the thing,

56:07.114 --> 56:09.158
and I just...

56:09.200 --> 56:10.743
just don't know what else to do.

56:12.453 --> 56:14.830
Sounds like to me
you have to break the pattern.

56:14.872 --> 56:18.167
If you want to keep him alive,
that's the only way.

56:21.003 --> 56:22.213
Well?

56:24.131 --> 56:25.841
I didn't say
I had all the answers.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.635
I thought you said
you could fix anything.

56:29.553 --> 56:30.638
Well...

56:30.679 --> 56:33.933
there's also a chance
that maybe

56:33.974 --> 56:35.684
you're not meant to save him.

56:35.726 --> 56:38.437
-What?
-Don't get me wrong.

56:38.479 --> 56:42.191
You've been telling me,
no matter what you change,

56:42.233 --> 56:43.984
he still ends up dying.

56:44.026 --> 56:45.861
-So...
-So, so...

56:45.903 --> 56:50.032
maybe you should just enjoy
the extra time you have
with him.

56:50.074 --> 56:52.910
Most people only get one shot

56:52.952 --> 56:55.121
at being with the person
they love.

56:55.162 --> 56:57.414
You've been given two.

57:00.543 --> 57:03.170
Which is all the more
reason why I...

57:03.212 --> 57:05.005
I need to try and save him.

57:05.047 --> 57:07.466
Well, y-y-you're
telling me to give up,

57:07.508 --> 57:09.844
and I... I...
I can't just do that.

57:09.885 --> 57:12.263
I can't just sit here
with a second chance

57:12.304 --> 57:13.722
and just let him die.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.850
-Wait a minute!
-I have to try.

57:15.891 --> 57:18.435
You, you're bleeding.

57:21.564 --> 57:23.023
Laura. Hey, hey. Hey!

57:26.610 --> 57:28.154
Shit!

57:29.738 --> 57:31.198
-What's going on?
-I-I don't know.

57:31.240 --> 57:32.825
I think she cut herself.
Hang on.

57:37.163 --> 57:39.039
Laura, hey,
what the hell happened?

57:39.081 --> 57:41.959
The player ran out of batteries,
everything got all weird
and there was a fire.

57:42.001 --> 57:43.752
But don't worry.
Listen...

57:43.794 --> 57:45.963
Oh, my God. Huh?

57:47.715 --> 57:49.967
We need to get her to the ER.
That looks pretty deep.

57:50.009 --> 57:51.844
-Yeah.
-I'll pull my car up, okay?

57:51.886 --> 57:53.554
-We'll meet you outside.
-Harrison...

57:53.596 --> 57:55.472
Here, apply some pressure.

57:55.514 --> 57:57.641
The, um, article,
I read about what happened.

57:57.683 --> 58:00.227
-Mm-hmm.
-Stay away
from Beach Road, okay?

58:00.269 --> 58:02.897
We go for a walk there
on the 25th after a rainstorm,

58:02.938 --> 58:05.524
and, uh, there's
some downed power lines.

58:05.566 --> 58:06.817
Okay, okay.

58:06.859 --> 58:08.903
Maybe you need to spend
less time with me too.

58:08.944 --> 58:10.613
What the hell are you
talking about now?

58:10.654 --> 58:13.282
I don't know,
nothing seems to be working.
We have to try it, okay?

58:13.324 --> 58:14.825
We're running out of time.

58:14.867 --> 58:17.328
If that doesn't keep you alive,
we only have two more chances.

58:17.369 --> 58:20.080
-Okay.
-Harrison, did she hit her head?

58:35.137 --> 58:37.431
Who wants some 'nanas?

58:38.766 --> 58:40.684
I'm so sorry!

58:58.494 --> 58:59.870
Cooper.

58:59.912 --> 59:02.498
Hey.

59:02.539 --> 59:04.792
There you are.
Where the hell did you go?

59:04.833 --> 59:06.627
Never mind.

59:06.669 --> 59:08.254
Is he still dead?

59:08.295 --> 59:13.217
Ah, a bad car accident
on 72, man.

59:13.259 --> 59:16.845
His old man couldn't control
the car and just hydroplaned.

59:18.889 --> 59:20.349
Dr. Knott was driving?

59:23.686 --> 59:25.688
Okay, um...

59:25.729 --> 59:27.398
That's an easy fix,
I can fix that.

59:27.439 --> 59:29.400
-Um...
-An easy fix?

59:29.441 --> 59:32.987
It sounds like every way
in which you try to save him,

59:33.028 --> 59:34.488
he still ends up dying.

59:35.823 --> 59:38.158
It's like the universe
has a plan,

59:38.200 --> 59:40.286
and you can't deviate
from that plan.

59:40.327 --> 59:45.124
Most people only get one shot
at being with the person
that they love.

59:45.165 --> 59:48.043
For whatever reason,
you've gotten two.

59:48.085 --> 59:50.337
Yeah, we've already
been through this.

59:50.379 --> 59:53.132
-We have?
-The other you.

59:53.173 --> 59:58.178
W-Well, if I came
to the same conclusion
on two different timelines,

59:58.220 --> 1:00:00.723
then maybe you should
consider it.

1:00:00.764 --> 1:00:03.017
Yeah, okay, um,
thanks for your help.

1:00:16.488 --> 1:00:17.865
Coming.

1:00:18.866 --> 1:00:20.075
Hi.

1:00:24.121 --> 1:00:26.540
You know what you pulled earlier
was pretty messed up.

1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:31.837
I made so much progress
this past year,

1:00:31.879 --> 1:00:34.673
and you just come in here
and say all that stuff to me?

1:00:38.385 --> 1:00:43.140
One of the toughest things
about these past four years,
Laura, was that...

1:00:43.182 --> 1:00:45.976
I didn't just lose
my brother and my dad.

1:00:48.687 --> 1:00:50.481
I lost my best friend too.

1:00:52.691 --> 1:00:53.984
Chloe, I'm...

1:00:56.570 --> 1:00:58.739
I'm so sorry
for not being there.

1:01:04.495 --> 1:01:05.996
Don't really have an excuse.

1:01:06.038 --> 1:01:07.790
I'm not looking for an excuse.

1:01:19.176 --> 1:01:20.511
You know, uh...

1:01:22.471 --> 1:01:24.431
a few weeks
before Harrison's birthday,

1:01:26.308 --> 1:01:27.810
I tried to break up with him.

1:01:30.604 --> 1:01:32.523
Tried to convince him to leave.

1:01:34.775 --> 1:01:37.111
But his mind was made up,
he was not changing it.

1:01:38.612 --> 1:01:40.280
I should have...

1:01:40.322 --> 1:01:42.991
I should have argued more,
I should have fought.

1:01:44.785 --> 1:01:47.663
I've been trying
to figure out how to keep him
and save him, but...

1:01:49.998 --> 1:01:51.625
what if I can't have both?

1:01:51.667 --> 1:01:54.545
You're doing it again,
you're just diving back
into all of it.

1:01:54.586 --> 1:01:56.338
I need to go.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:57.506
What?

1:01:57.548 --> 1:01:58.841
I need to go.

1:01:58.882 --> 1:02:01.635
No. Laura, please,
can we just talk?

1:02:01.677 --> 1:02:03.929
-I think you need help.
-We'll talk tomorrow!

1:02:36.545 --> 1:02:39.465
Most people just talk
about what they want to do
and they never do it.

1:02:42.384 --> 1:02:44.178
-It's you?
-Yeah.

1:02:44.219 --> 1:02:47.306
It didn't work, and
it's not just you this time,
your dad is dead, too.

1:02:47.347 --> 1:02:50.350
-Wait, what? How?
-It...

1:02:50.392 --> 1:02:51.643
How?

1:02:51.685 --> 1:02:53.562
You guys were going
for a drive along the coast

1:02:53.604 --> 1:02:55.939
and the road was slick
from the storm
and he lost control,

1:02:55.981 --> 1:02:57.483
but it's okay,
I know how to fix this.

1:02:57.524 --> 1:02:59.026
You need to leave.

1:02:59.067 --> 1:03:00.569
How is that gonna fix anything?

1:03:00.611 --> 1:03:03.197
We just haven't
been thinking big enough.

1:03:03.238 --> 1:03:04.990
What do you mean?

1:03:05.032 --> 1:03:07.868
We keep addressing
the immediate problem,
which is how you die, right?

1:03:07.910 --> 1:03:10.454
-Isn't that what we're trying
to do here, keep me alive?
-Yeah.

1:03:10.496 --> 1:03:13.332
But no matter which way you die,
it's always after you
should have gone to school,

1:03:13.373 --> 1:03:16.460
after you decided
to stay here with me.

1:03:16.502 --> 1:03:17.794
So you want me to leave?

1:03:17.836 --> 1:03:20.422
That's the only way.
You won't be here to be killed

1:03:20.464 --> 1:03:22.758
and you won't be
driving with your dad
so he'll be saved too.

1:03:22.799 --> 1:03:24.927
It's the safest bet.

1:03:24.968 --> 1:03:26.887
Well, what does
that mean for you?

1:03:29.389 --> 1:03:31.600
As long as you're alive,
I'll be okay.

1:03:32.976 --> 1:03:34.895
That's all that matters to me.

1:03:38.899 --> 1:03:41.944
Promise me you'll do this.

1:03:41.985 --> 1:03:43.904
You have to break up with me.

1:03:46.031 --> 1:03:48.492
You really think
it's the only way?

1:03:48.534 --> 1:03:50.619
Nothing else has worked.

1:03:55.749 --> 1:03:58.544
You know, we had almost
the exact same conversation

1:03:58.585 --> 1:04:00.170
when we were here before.

1:04:00.212 --> 1:04:01.630
Déjà vu.

1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:04.550
Yeah.

1:04:05.759 --> 1:04:07.886
So if I leave...

1:04:07.928 --> 1:04:10.347
this is it then.

1:04:10.389 --> 1:04:11.515
Yeah.

1:04:12.891 --> 1:04:14.935
That'll make this the last song.

1:04:15.978 --> 1:04:18.355
And if it doesn't work?

1:04:18.397 --> 1:04:19.940
Are you gonna be okay?

1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:25.112
I just need to know.

1:04:27.573 --> 1:04:28.907
Yeah.

1:04:31.743 --> 1:04:32.953
I'll call you when I get back.

1:04:32.995 --> 1:04:34.413
Don't change your number, okay?

1:04:34.454 --> 1:04:35.706
I won't.

1:04:35.747 --> 1:04:37.541
See you in the future.

1:04:37.583 --> 1:04:39.042
Okay, I'll see you.

1:04:56.602 --> 1:04:58.854
-We're sorry.

1:04:58.895 --> 1:05:01.523
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

1:05:01.565 --> 1:05:03.775
or is no longer in service.

1:05:19.041 --> 1:05:20.959
-Whoo-hoo!

1:05:22.502 --> 1:05:25.422
Harrison, you promised me.
You promised me you'd go.

1:05:25.464 --> 1:05:28.050
-Laura.
-I looked you right
in the eyes when you did,

1:05:28.091 --> 1:05:30.552
-and you lied to me,
you straight-up lied to me.
-Listen.

1:05:30.594 --> 1:05:33.680
-No, I need you to understand.
-What's there to understand?
You're still dead!

1:05:33.722 --> 1:05:36.683
I tried, I tried to leave.

1:05:36.725 --> 1:05:39.603
I tried, okay,
but you forgot about you.

1:05:39.645 --> 1:05:42.522
Th-The other you, the one
that stays when you leave?

1:05:42.564 --> 1:05:45.776
I'm left with her just
staring at me in anticipation,

1:05:45.817 --> 1:05:49.613
like she, like you are waiting,

1:05:49.655 --> 1:05:51.114
hanging on to the moment,
my words.

1:05:51.156 --> 1:05:53.325
It's like time stops for you.

1:05:53.367 --> 1:05:55.494
You haven't heard
a word that we've said,

1:05:55.535 --> 1:05:58.205
and I know that you wouldn't
understand, and I can't...

1:05:58.246 --> 1:05:59.581
I can't bear
to hurt you like that.

1:05:59.623 --> 1:06:01.667
But you have to,
you have to, Harrison.

1:06:01.708 --> 1:06:04.378
This is-- it's your life
we're talking about, okay?

1:06:04.419 --> 1:06:07.172
We don't even know if it's
gonna make a difference, Laura.

1:06:07.214 --> 1:06:08.799
We don't even know.

1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:11.677
The plane might crash,
another car might
come out of nowhere.

1:06:11.718 --> 1:06:15.013
We don't know, and I would
much rather take my chances
here with you.

1:06:16.682 --> 1:06:19.059
And look, if...

1:06:19.101 --> 1:06:21.770
if not being able to face
death alone makes me selfish,

1:06:21.812 --> 1:06:25.774
then I'm sorry, but I am
selfishly in love with you.

1:06:32.739 --> 1:06:34.533
I've wasted this.

1:06:34.574 --> 1:06:35.617
Laura.

1:06:35.659 --> 1:06:37.119
I've wasted this.

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:39.788
Cooper, he tried to...
he tried to warn me,

1:06:39.830 --> 1:06:44.084
this one chance to be with you,
I should have just lived it.

1:06:44.126 --> 1:06:45.252
I should have...

1:06:45.293 --> 1:06:48.255
But I... I-I wasted it
and now it's gone.

1:06:48.296 --> 1:06:49.923
-No, hey, hey.
-Why did I do that?

1:06:49.965 --> 1:06:52.259
You did that for the same reason
that I can't leave,

1:06:52.300 --> 1:06:54.886
and that, that is the best

1:06:54.928 --> 1:06:58.390

We're gonna need you
in the kitchen.

1:11:58.106 --> 1:12:01.568
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?

1:12:01.609 --> 1:12:03.069
You want the moon?

1:12:03.111 --> 1:12:05.321

throw a lasso around it

I'll give you the moon, Mary.

1:12:10.452 --> 1:12:11.953
I'll take it.

1:12:11.995 --> 1:12:13.538
Then what?

1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:15.749
Well,
then you could swallow it,

1:12:15.790 --> 1:12:17.542
and it would all dissolve, see?

1:12:17.584 --> 1:12:21.212
And the moonbeams would
shoot out of your fingers
and your toes

1:12:21.254 --> 1:12:24.090
and the ends of your hair,
and then...

1:12:24.132 --> 1:12:25.425

to beat this year,

a few years ago...

1:12:59.626 --> 1:13:01.211

better than mine.

the painting coming along?

1:13:11.346 --> 1:13:14.015

that's a penalty!

1:13:14.057 --> 1:13:16.101

going all right.

What are you doing?

1:13:18.186 --> 1:13:20.021

a lot, Mom.
