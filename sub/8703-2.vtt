00:17.271 --> 00:18.477
Bring us that boat.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.270
Happy birthday, Dad.

00:20.271 --> 00:22.061
Happy birthday. We love you.

00:22.062 --> 00:23.151
Open your mouth.

00:26.799 --> 00:27.928
I love you, bro.

00:27.929 --> 00:29.903
But you are a loser.

00:31.438 --> 00:33.902
Hey, shoo, go on, get! Go on, scram.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.181
The Cat said we had

00:35.182 --> 00:37.997
24 hours to return the boat.

00:37.998 --> 00:39.022
What time, exactly,

00:39.023 --> 00:39.982
did he say that?

00:41.103 --> 00:43.055
Anyone?

00:47.823 --> 00:49.967
Okay, I'll just ballpark it.

00:49.968 --> 00:52.253
- We should go.
- Hold on.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.733
He deserves more dignity than this.

00:55.696 --> 00:56.655
We'll give it to him,

00:57.326 --> 00:59.229
we just got to return the boat first, okay?

00:59.379 --> 01:00.350
- Get the camera you forgot.

01:00.405 --> 01:01.583
And get the camera that I forgot.

01:01.584 --> 01:02.633
I'm just saying it would have been really convenient

01:02.634 --> 01:04.116
- Yeah, Christ's sake.
- If you hadn't forgotten it.

01:04.117 --> 01:05.075
- Stop.

01:50.865 --> 01:51.824
Yes.

01:52.542 --> 01:53.546
Found it!

01:54.386 --> 01:56.035
- I'll try and get the boat started.
- Yeah.

01:56.881 --> 01:58.800
Come on, guys, let's get the hell out of here.

01:58.801 --> 01:59.833
Need any help?

02:00.261 --> 02:02.486
Do you know anything about boats you didn't know yesterday?

02:03.475 --> 02:05.892
Hey. Hey, why you got to throw shit into the water?

02:05.893 --> 02:07.620
Because our fingerprints are all over them.

02:07.621 --> 02:09.187
Uh, oceans aren't polluted enough?

02:09.189 --> 02:10.852
Okay, how about we just turn ourselves in to the police?

02:10.853 --> 02:12.772
Would that be environmentally responsible enough?

02:12.773 --> 02:14.181
Let's wipe everything down.

02:14.182 --> 02:15.141
Copy!

02:20.261 --> 02:21.412
Yes!

02:21.413 --> 02:22.821
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:22.822 --> 02:24.165
Yeah, Lex!

02:24.166 --> 02:25.253
Lexy!

02:28.998 --> 02:30.501
- What's that?
- What?

02:30.502 --> 02:31.877
Listen.

03:04.806 --> 03:07.367
This was not the meeting place.

03:10.087 --> 03:12.135
I'm sorry, can we help you?

03:18.567 --> 03:20.550
Seahorse?

03:20.551 --> 03:22.632
This is the boat, yes?

03:24.103 --> 03:25.766
There is a problem?

03:25.767 --> 03:26.982
Not with us.

03:26.983 --> 03:28.806
Russell!

03:28.807 --> 03:30.790
No, n-n-n-no, no, there-there's no problem.

03:30.791 --> 03:32.940
- So you're ready?
- We're ready.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.028
Move!

04:00.958 --> 04:01.995
It's all here?

04:04.041 --> 04:05.545
It's all there.

04:34.346 --> 04:35.912
Why touch it?

04:35.913 --> 04:37.257
I'm helping.

04:37.258 --> 04:38.793
Don't.

04:38.794 --> 04:41.098
He's not... he's not gonna touch it anymore.

04:43.434 --> 04:44.426
Who are you?

04:48.874 --> 04:50.922
Who are you?

04:52.971 --> 04:55.721
Look, we're the guys Jesús sent with the drugs.

04:55.722 --> 04:57.514
You got a problem with the way we do it,

04:57.515 --> 04:58.923
take it up with him.

05:03.531 --> 05:05.322
Give it to me.

05:12.269 --> 05:15.305
This payment doesn't get to Jesús,

05:15.306 --> 05:16.587
it's on you.

05:16.588 --> 05:18.091
Sounds fair.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.119
Whose cell phone is that?

05:23.851 --> 05:24.810
Mine.

05:25.228 --> 05:26.379
You bring a cell phone to a drop?

05:26.380 --> 05:27.691
You want cops to track us?

05:34.173 --> 05:37.132
You put my wife in danger.

06:15.259 --> 06:16.141
What just...?

06:16.142 --> 06:17.125
Was Milo...?

06:17.613 --> 06:18.572
Okay.

06:19.193 --> 06:20.496
Holy shit.

06:21.902 --> 06:22.936
It's euros.

06:26.670 --> 06:28.172
Okay, well, we still got time.

06:28.173 --> 06:29.223
We can do this, okay?

06:29.224 --> 06:31.179
Give me your cell phones.

06:31.203 --> 06:33.123
Come on, give me your cell phones. Quick.

06:34.817 --> 06:37.509
- What are you doing?!
- You want the cops to track us here?

06:37.510 --> 06:39.158
Do you want her to catch us with this money?

06:39.159 --> 06:40.506
Well, you could have asked us before just tossing them

06:40.507 --> 06:41.762
- into the Atlantic.
- Caribbean.

06:41.763 --> 06:43.841
They can still trace it when it's underwater, can't they?

06:43.842 --> 06:45.441
Not in salt water!

06:45.442 --> 06:47.756
- Right?
- He took out a fuse.

06:47.891 --> 06:49.980
- What do we do with this money?
- We return it

06:49.981 --> 06:51.521
along with the boat to Jesús, obviously.

06:51.522 --> 06:53.282
Hey, I can't start the boat without a fuse.

06:53.283 --> 06:54.785
Then we'll get another fuse!

06:54.786 --> 06:56.973
Yeah, and in the meantime, what do we do with the cash?

06:56.974 --> 06:58.323
Uh, we'll leave somebody here with it.

06:58.383 --> 06:59.370
Oh, that sounds real safe.

06:59.371 --> 07:01.251
Well, what's your idea, then, huh?

07:24.420 --> 07:26.500
Whoa. Dude.

07:32.944 --> 07:34.133
Why the fuck were you running?

07:34.134 --> 07:35.708
I was running 'cause you were running.

07:35.738 --> 07:37.330
- I was running 'cause you were fucking running.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.619
What? Did you see anything?

07:38.620 --> 07:40.191
Are you fucking kidding?

07:40.192 --> 07:41.481
- Huh?
- No.

07:46.606 --> 07:47.632
What are you doing?

07:48.748 --> 07:50.029
I'm counting the money.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.948
We should have left it on the boat.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.772
Should have left it on the fucking boat.

07:53.773 --> 07:55.469
Why-why-why did we take it? Are we fucking insane?!

07:55.470 --> 07:57.165
We had to take the money, Lex, okay?

07:57.166 --> 07:58.668
It's okay, we'll fix it.

07:58.669 --> 07:59.884
We'll fix it, we'll figure it out, okay?

07:59.885 --> 08:01.006
It's all right.

08:06.222 --> 08:08.460
Five...

08:08.461 --> 08:10.318
And a half million.

08:11.982 --> 08:13.069
Which is what?

08:13.924 --> 08:15.370
$7 million.

08:16.494 --> 08:18.733
That's change-your-life money.

08:18.734 --> 08:20.525
- That's drug money.
- Yeah, but it's...

08:20.526 --> 08:22.637
That's get-yourself-killed money.

08:22.638 --> 08:24.813
This kind of money?

08:24.814 --> 08:26.927
You could just disappear.

08:28.847 --> 08:32.683
Just, like, buy a boat and just sail off anywhere.

08:32.815 --> 08:34.092
Like where?

08:34.094 --> 08:35.662
Where are you gonna sail to from here?

08:35.663 --> 08:36.817
I don't know.

08:37.775 --> 08:38.952
Cuba?

08:42.414 --> 08:43.491
Did he know?

08:45.295 --> 08:48.303
Did Milo fucking know what was on the boat?

09:00.431 --> 09:01.584
Let's pack it up.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.745
Someone else needs to carry that bag.

09:45.746 --> 09:47.665
Well, I hurt... I hurt my shoulder

09:47.666 --> 09:49.296
hauling it over those rocks back there.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.928
Oh, it's pretty painful, huh?

09:50.929 --> 09:53.617
- You know I tore my rotator cuff.
- In the '90s.

09:53.618 --> 09:55.568
- Playing intramural softball.
- Yeah, well,

09:55.569 --> 09:56.848
it flares up whenever I tweak it,

09:56.849 --> 09:58.321
- which I fucking did.
- Okay.

09:58.322 --> 09:59.824
So, what now?

09:59.825 --> 10:01.072
I have a plan.

10:01.073 --> 10:02.512
Just let me think a minute.

10:02.513 --> 10:04.433
Did you not just hear me say "I have a plan"?

10:06.276 --> 10:07.025
Two of us stay here with the cash,

10:07.026 --> 10:08.241
the other two guys

10:08.242 --> 10:10.033
hike back to the villa, get Milo's car,

10:10.034 --> 10:11.952
come back, pick up the cash and the other two guys.

10:12.477 --> 10:14.128
We return the boat, but keep the bag.

10:14.129 --> 10:16.753
Now, we cannot bring that money back to the villa,

10:16.754 --> 10:18.482
knowing that we got cats and cops

10:18.483 --> 10:20.017
and whatever the fuck else snooping around.

10:20.018 --> 10:21.362
So we rent a car,

10:21.363 --> 10:22.559
stash the money in the car,

10:22.560 --> 10:24.013
park the car in a safe place,

10:24.658 --> 10:26.193
take our asses home.

10:26.194 --> 10:29.297
Mail the keys back to this... Jesús dude,

10:29.298 --> 10:31.731
so he doesn't come looking for us.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.426
It's not bad.

10:36.880 --> 10:37.847
Okay.

10:38.451 --> 10:39.922
Lex and I will stay with the cash,

10:39.923 --> 10:41.330
you guys go get the car.

10:41.331 --> 10:42.578
What, I hike five miles through the jungle

10:42.579 --> 10:43.793
while you sit in the shade?

10:43.794 --> 10:45.239
Yeah, well, you're not in pain.

10:46.163 --> 10:49.234
Look, anybody's hiking back for sure, it's Lex.

10:49.235 --> 10:51.634
What? I've been carrying this money more than anyone.

10:51.635 --> 10:52.851
Why am I hiking back?

10:52.852 --> 10:54.004
- Cobi.
- What?

10:54.400 --> 10:55.382
Where's the villa?

10:56.403 --> 10:57.684
Which way?

10:59.315 --> 11:00.595
Joel?

11:05.683 --> 11:07.858
Oh, so-so I'm punished for having a sense of direction?

11:07.859 --> 11:09.010
Well, I'm the money guy.

11:09.011 --> 11:10.578
I should stay with the money.

11:10.579 --> 11:12.503
Why? That doesn't even make any sense.

11:12.533 --> 11:15.283
Well, for one thing, I'm used to being around a lot of cash.

11:15.284 --> 11:16.563
It doesn't intimidate me.

11:16.564 --> 11:17.939
Well, trust me, I'm not intimidated.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.155
No, you know what?

11:19.156 --> 11:20.299
Joel is staying here with me.

11:20.336 --> 11:22.515
- Why?
- Because we wouldn't be here

11:22.516 --> 11:24.083
if you hadn't left the camera on the damn boat.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.610
Yeah, keep bringing it up, asshole.

11:25.611 --> 11:27.923
Besides, who said you get to decide anyway?

11:27.924 --> 11:29.075
It's my plan.

11:29.076 --> 11:30.490
Yeah, but you're not in charge!

11:31.651 --> 11:32.610
Okay.

11:33.119 --> 11:34.291
Vote on it.

11:34.292 --> 11:35.891
Who here thinks

11:35.892 --> 11:37.695
that Cobi should be the one to go back with Lex?

11:39.837 --> 11:42.047
Who here thinks that Gus should go back...

11:43.014 --> 11:44.632
that Gus should go back with Lex?

11:45.654 --> 11:47.060
What's your vote?

11:47.061 --> 11:47.814
I abstain.

11:47.838 --> 11:49.215
You can't abstain!

11:49.216 --> 11:51.636
That's the same as a vote against me.

11:51.637 --> 11:53.478
Okay, whatever. Come on, let's get this over with.

11:53.502 --> 11:54.955
So let's go.

11:54.956 --> 11:56.756
Hey, Lex, you know what?

11:56.757 --> 11:58.580
Going by yourself, you can move faster,

11:58.581 --> 12:00.788
- You... it's more stealthy...
- I'm not going alone.

12:00.789 --> 12:02.450
- Goddamn it!
- Let's go.

12:02.451 --> 12:03.893
Bring back water.

12:03.894 --> 12:05.501
Sparkling or flat?

12:37.589 --> 12:39.222
You see how Cobi lied to them

12:39.223 --> 12:41.335
about us working for Jesús?

12:43.735 --> 12:45.174
Saved our asses.

12:45.175 --> 12:46.940
Yeah, but did you notice how good he was at it?

12:48.319 --> 12:49.758
Meaning what?

12:50.792 --> 12:51.383
Just... nothing.

12:51.384 --> 12:52.899
It just came very naturally to him.

12:54.199 --> 12:55.192
That's all.

13:04.589 --> 13:06.403
What the... fuck?

13:06.616 --> 13:08.918
- You think they bite?
- I don't know, I never met one before.

13:08.919 --> 13:10.870
- Fuck.
- Well, should we just run past it?

13:10.871 --> 13:12.439
What if it runs after us?

13:12.440 --> 13:13.654
I don't know, how fast do they run?

13:13.655 --> 13:14.743
Here, hold on.

13:14.744 --> 13:15.818
What if it's poisonous?

13:16.856 --> 13:17.847
Okay. Okay, here's

13:17.848 --> 13:20.119
what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna, like...

13:20.120 --> 13:22.424
I'm gonna get this and I'm gonna pull it, like, right over.

13:22.425 --> 13:24.379
- You just, like, scurry around and...
- No, no, no.

13:24.380 --> 13:25.863
- You go scurry around.
- I'll, like, distract it.

13:25.864 --> 13:27.229
- You go first, you got the stick.

13:29.290 --> 13:30.744
Fuck it, let's go find another trail.

13:38.616 --> 13:39.611
Hey.

13:40.504 --> 13:43.416
You cool with the way Gus is giving orders?

13:44.414 --> 13:47.192
I mean, don't you find it strange that one day,

13:47.193 --> 13:49.144
he's, like, a lawyer with some big law firm

13:49.145 --> 13:51.256
and the next, he's selling antiques out of his living room?

13:51.257 --> 13:52.536
His firm was restructured

13:52.537 --> 13:54.584
and he wanted to get out of the rat race.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.344
That's what he told us,

13:56.345 --> 13:57.975
but a few months ago, I looked it up.

13:58.679 --> 14:02.458
His firm was under investigation and he got disbarred.

14:04.090 --> 14:05.720
- For what?
- I don't know.

14:05.721 --> 14:06.834
I'm just saying.

14:07.993 --> 14:09.785
- That's the guy calling the shots.
- Yeah, well,

14:09.786 --> 14:11.577
trust me.

14:11.578 --> 14:13.018
I know what Gus is capable of.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.031
It's this way.

14:17.672 --> 14:19.049
No.

14:19.072 --> 14:20.607
No, this way.

14:20.608 --> 14:22.975
Definitely. Come on.

14:41.473 --> 14:44.033
What the fuck?

14:50.754 --> 14:53.761
What is it? Like a... shrine?

15:02.401 --> 15:04.449
It's fucked up, is what it is.

15:10.209 --> 15:13.313
"Ex-tah-bee."

15:13.314 --> 15:14.370
Xtabai.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.554
Ew.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.706
- Ugh!
- What?

15:40.707 --> 15:41.986
Look at this shit.

15:45.250 --> 15:49.086
Fucking sick shit.

15:51.074 --> 15:52.547
I told you it was this way!

15:56.323 --> 15:58.722
Just... I'm literally

15:58.723 --> 16:00.836
sitting on $7 million.

16:02.788 --> 16:04.699
That I can't ever spend.

16:05.478 --> 16:06.887
And will probably get us killed.

16:09.027 --> 16:10.435
Thanks, Milo.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.124
Ah, fucking Milo.

16:25.508 --> 16:28.068
Filmishmish. Tomorrow we have apricots.

16:46.917 --> 16:49.124
Aw... I don't know the code.

16:49.125 --> 16:51.940
Shit. We're just gonna have to climb it.

16:51.941 --> 16:55.140
It's the last year the Cubs won the World Series.

17:03.781 --> 17:05.220
What is that?

17:05.221 --> 17:07.717
I don't know.

17:13.061 --> 17:14.885
- Kick it.
- What?

17:14.886 --> 17:16.709
Yeah, just go give it a little kick.

17:16.710 --> 17:18.693
You give it a little kick.

17:18.694 --> 17:20.387
Just nudge it.

17:20.388 --> 17:22.438
Just a little bit.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.534
Um, Angel?

17:46.535 --> 17:48.805
Hello. I'm ready.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.278
Did we say now?

17:50.279 --> 17:51.366
Yes.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.062
Exactly now.

17:53.063 --> 17:54.310
I brung all the paperwork.

17:55.751 --> 17:57.670
Oh, wow. Okay.

17:57.671 --> 17:59.689
See, we gotta go.

17:59.713 --> 18:01.888
But you make arrangements with me, for this time,

18:01.912 --> 18:02.871
now, today.

18:02.872 --> 18:05.272
Yeah, yeah. Well... the... I...

18:05.273 --> 18:07.030
Yes, I remember now.

18:07.031 --> 18:08.734
I skip work today to do this.

18:08.735 --> 18:10.806
Yeah, well, we're going to have to reschedule.

18:10.807 --> 18:13.240
Did I reschedule when you asked me to your bedroom

18:13.241 --> 18:14.711
to make dreams come true?

18:14.712 --> 18:16.631
No, you didn't, and I'm...

18:16.632 --> 18:18.666
It was a wonderful evening.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.471
You brag how you make all your millions,

18:20.472 --> 18:22.776
that you can help my family with our transfer of money.

18:22.777 --> 18:24.983
I can. And I will. I just can't do it right now.

18:24.984 --> 18:26.456
Well, you promise!

18:26.457 --> 18:28.183
Look, our friends that...

18:28.184 --> 18:30.296
You met them. Those guys?

18:30.297 --> 18:32.056
They're-they're stranded right now.

18:32.057 --> 18:33.240
We have to go pick them up.

18:33.241 --> 18:34.680
It is an emergency.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.217
Out of my control.

18:40.778 --> 18:41.737
I see.

18:42.561 --> 18:43.704
So I can help you later...

18:43.705 --> 18:45.304
Like, like, later...

18:45.305 --> 18:48.077
- with the paperwork.
- I will wait here for you, then.

18:48.078 --> 18:48.610
No.

18:48.634 --> 18:50.135
I will wait here for you to go and pick up your friends,

18:50.137 --> 18:52.088
and when you get back, we will do the paperwork.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.840
No, no, look, see, uh... there's no one here right now,

18:54.841 --> 18:57.690
so I'd feel a lot more comfortable if we... Goddamn it.

19:08.186 --> 19:09.464
Don't. Don't even...

19:09.465 --> 19:10.905
Don't look at me like that, dude.

19:10.906 --> 19:14.620
So, how many millions are you sitting on exactly?

19:14.621 --> 19:17.562
Forgive me, I'm not as versed in your portfolio as she is.

19:17.563 --> 19:20.085
- You know...
- Hey, you faked some credentials,

19:20.109 --> 19:22.489
she fakes an orgasm... Everybody wins.

19:24.221 --> 19:25.401
She didn't fake anything.

19:27.705 --> 19:29.145
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.

19:29.146 --> 19:30.507
Fuck!

19:34.409 --> 19:35.533
Fuck.

19:47.993 --> 19:49.835
We're not gonna make it out of this, are we?

19:52.486 --> 19:53.491
We might.

20:02.649 --> 20:03.929
Maybe you're lucky.

20:04.696 --> 20:06.617
Being estranged from your kids, you know?

20:09.880 --> 20:12.727
They already know how to survive without you.

20:13.984 --> 20:14.943
My...

20:19.852 --> 20:21.047
I didn't mean it like that, man.

20:21.048 --> 20:23.641
It's all right, it's all right.

20:52.153 --> 20:53.880
What's this?

20:53.881 --> 20:55.289
We don't know.

20:55.290 --> 20:56.505
It was just lying in the driveway

20:56.506 --> 20:57.594
when we got back to the villa...

20:57.618 --> 20:59.832
No name, no address, nothing.

20:59.833 --> 21:01.401
Well, why didn't you open it?

21:01.402 --> 21:03.051
Because we don't know what it is.

21:03.052 --> 21:04.047
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:04.048 --> 21:05.673
That thing might be booby-trapped.

21:10.266 --> 21:11.482
Jesus Christ!

21:11.483 --> 21:12.600
What the fuck does that mean?

21:12.601 --> 21:13.604
Is there a message with it?

21:13.605 --> 21:15.096
Maybe the gun is the message.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.130
- Saying what?
- I don't know,

21:16.154 --> 21:18.300
maybe they're saying we should kill ourselves.

21:18.301 --> 21:19.601
You got a better explanation?

21:19.602 --> 21:21.596
- Maybe they want us to kill someone.
- Who?

21:21.597 --> 21:22.972
We wait for instructions.

21:22.973 --> 21:24.733
Anyone know how to use this thing?

21:24.734 --> 21:25.916
Not really, you?

21:25.917 --> 21:26.972
Shit, no.

21:26.973 --> 21:28.092
Lex?

21:28.093 --> 21:29.342
Besides pull the trigger? No.

21:31.199 --> 21:33.118
I'll hang onto it.

21:35.038 --> 21:37.406
I played paintball a few times.

21:41.699 --> 21:43.017
Fuck.

21:43.159 --> 21:44.510
Lex, we need a fuse and a car.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.333
You want to hurry the fuck up?

22:31.583 --> 22:34.239
So, uh, nothing too small.

22:34.745 --> 22:35.775
Because there's four of us.

22:35.776 --> 22:37.310
We're gonna need some leg room.

22:38.318 --> 22:41.148
You should've told me midsize to begin with.

22:41.792 --> 22:44.145
I have to go check and see if we have any.

22:53.344 --> 22:54.511
Sorry.

22:57.825 --> 22:59.295
How was the walk back to the villa?

22:59.296 --> 23:02.394
Good, how was, uh, sitting in the shade on your ass?

23:03.271 --> 23:04.927
Refreshing.

23:05.537 --> 23:08.512
Hey, uh, Lex was asking and I couldn't answer.

23:08.513 --> 23:09.920
What-what happened to your law firm?

23:09.921 --> 23:12.032
Wasn't it under investigation or something?

23:12.033 --> 23:12.832
No.

23:12.833 --> 23:14.848
We got hit with a malpractice suit.

23:14.849 --> 23:16.161
You know, total bullshit.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.272
Fucked over by the big boys as usual.

23:18.273 --> 23:21.409
Hmm, I thought you and your firm were the big boys.

23:23.778 --> 23:26.272
There's always someone bigger.

23:26.273 --> 23:28.418
Why didn't you just go somewhere else to be a lawyer?

23:29.550 --> 23:31.936
'Cause law wasn't what I thought it was gonna be.

23:31.937 --> 23:34.498
You know, I think I'm happier now.

23:37.506 --> 23:39.456
Going from a sweet weekly check

23:39.457 --> 23:41.249
to starting a new business, divorce.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.945
That had to hammer you financially.

23:42.946 --> 23:45.153
Look, look, if this is about the ten grand that I owe you,

23:46.127 --> 23:47.328
just say when, all right?

23:47.329 --> 23:49.153
Let me know, let me know when you need it.

23:49.154 --> 23:50.818
- I don't.
- Sounds like you need it.

23:50.819 --> 23:53.057
No, I'm just, I can help. I'm not...

23:53.058 --> 23:54.721
- I'm just worried about you, that's all.
- Worried about me?

23:54.722 --> 23:56.833
Well, you should probably worry about yourself.

23:56.834 --> 23:58.092
All right.

24:09.331 --> 24:11.698
We have a midsize.

24:11.699 --> 24:13.104
Who will be paying for this?

24:13.142 --> 24:14.164
He will.

24:14.273 --> 24:15.296
Why me?

24:15.297 --> 24:16.783
You can afford it.

24:16.784 --> 24:18.690
It's your plan.

24:19.215 --> 24:21.359
Have you decided on insurance?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.735
Yeah, um, yes.

24:22.736 --> 24:25.984
We will take liability, collision.

24:26.337 --> 24:28.950
Oh, and we'll prepay for a full tank of gas.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.568
Oh, right here, right here.

24:42.569 --> 24:44.873
Right here. Dude.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.891
Right there, right there.

24:46.915 --> 24:48.418
Good thing we got the gas option.

24:48.419 --> 24:50.049
We're just gonna run out.

24:50.050 --> 24:52.001
Making sure we're not being tailed, that's all.

24:52.002 --> 24:53.473
- By who?
- Cops.

24:53.474 --> 24:54.497
The Cat.

24:54.498 --> 24:55.879
You ever heard of a guy named Jesús?

24:56.811 --> 24:57.582
Right there.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.081
Listen, we have to park

24:59.082 --> 25:00.362
the money in a place that doesn't have

25:00.363 --> 25:02.441
so much foot traffic that it draws attention,

25:02.442 --> 25:04.366
but it's not so private that people feel comfortable

25:04.367 --> 25:06.314
breaking into it... what's so hard to understand about that?

25:06.315 --> 25:07.371
Nothing.

25:07.986 --> 25:08.906
What is he doing?

25:08.907 --> 25:11.211
He's passed at least a dozen good spots.

25:11.212 --> 25:12.459
A-Another one right there!

25:12.460 --> 25:13.834
Christ! Come on, already!

25:13.835 --> 25:15.051
Easy! Jesus.

25:15.052 --> 25:17.130
We do not want to get pulled over.

25:17.131 --> 25:19.275
Yeah, well, my phone's in the Caribbean, so

25:19.276 --> 25:21.546
how am I supposed to communicate with him... smoke signals?

25:21.547 --> 25:23.755
Is that Lex honking at me?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.611
Yeah, probably. I'd honk, too.

25:25.612 --> 25:27.519
So-so we shouldn't be careful trying to find the right spot?

25:27.520 --> 25:28.763
You know what the point of this is?

25:28.787 --> 25:30.290
To return the money and the boat in time to save our asses

25:30.291 --> 25:32.799
- and get the fuck out of here!
- I will tell you what... Fuck.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.701
No, the point of it is, if you think you can do better,

25:34.702 --> 25:36.403
why don't you...?

25:39.223 --> 25:40.119
You distracted me!

25:40.120 --> 25:41.974
- Me?
- You distracted me.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.855
- Watch the road, dude.
- I was watching the road!

25:45.239 --> 25:47.254
Are you okay?

25:47.255 --> 25:49.879
- I am sorry. Is everyone okay?
- What were you doing?

25:49.880 --> 25:51.862
- My friend distracted me!
- Well, how are you gonna fix this?

25:51.863 --> 25:53.826
- It-It's not that bad.
- Is everyone okay?

25:53.827 --> 25:55.063
- Oh, you are with them?
- Yeah.

25:55.064 --> 25:56.726
Then ask your friends how they're going to pay for this!

25:56.727 --> 25:58.519
I'm very sorry, but we are in a hurry.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.991
Uh, how about we just exchange information,

25:59.992 --> 26:01.784
and we let the insurance company...

26:01.785 --> 26:03.415
You're tourists, right?

26:03.416 --> 26:04.856
Yes? From America.

26:04.857 --> 26:06.776
Is it that obvious?

26:06.777 --> 26:08.278
Yeah, yeah, we're tourists.

26:08.279 --> 26:09.719
Listen, I am very well insured.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.639
So I'm to let you just go back home and hope

26:11.640 --> 26:13.336
some insurance company sends me a check in six months?

26:13.337 --> 26:14.840
Yeah, no, thank you!

26:14.841 --> 26:17.144
I work the counter at the pharmacy around the corner.

26:17.145 --> 26:19.448
You think I can afford to pay for this myself?

26:19.449 --> 26:20.855
- We need to wrap this up.
- Yeah, I know.

26:20.856 --> 26:21.847
Give me a second.

26:21.848 --> 26:23.447
I am going to make this right.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.271
- Right now. Guys?
- What are you gonna do?

26:25.272 --> 26:27.864
Just give me whatever you have, give me whatever...

26:27.865 --> 26:29.111
- That's all I got.
- How about you, Cobi?

26:29.112 --> 26:30.232
That's plenty.

26:30.233 --> 26:31.545
- It's a piece of shit.
- Agreed, agreed.

26:31.546 --> 26:32.824
- We are so sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.032
- Thank you, all right?
- All right.

26:35.033 --> 26:37.560
$123?

26:37.561 --> 26:38.999
What is this shit?!

26:39.000 --> 26:40.888
- It's a piece of shit.
- Call the police now!

26:40.889 --> 26:42.264
- No, no, no, no.
- The Yankees are trying to rob me!

26:42.265 --> 26:43.800
Lady, no one's trying to rob you.

26:43.801 --> 26:45.688
- Then pay what you owe me.
- Okay, okay, all right.

26:45.689 --> 26:49.017
Listen to me, listen to me right fucking now, okay?

26:49.018 --> 26:50.361
Look, you see this right here?

26:50.362 --> 26:51.960
Take the $123,

26:51.961 --> 26:53.849
turn around, get back in your fucking shitty car,

26:53.850 --> 26:55.966
and get the fuck out of here right now.

26:56.619 --> 26:57.833
Or what?

26:58.682 --> 27:00.792
You'll shoot me dead in the street?

27:00.793 --> 27:03.226
- Hmm?
- No, you don't, you do not want to know.

27:03.227 --> 27:04.889
Oh, you will, you'll shoot me, huh?

27:04.890 --> 27:07.641
- The Yankee says he's going to shoot me!
- No! No! No! No!

27:07.642 --> 27:09.401
- Nobody's gonna shoot anybody!
- What the fuck are you doing?

27:09.402 --> 27:10.809
I said I was gonna shoot her.

27:10.810 --> 27:12.121
How about you just give me your name and address?

27:12.122 --> 27:13.689
I will give you double

27:13.690 --> 27:15.130
whatever it costs to fix this car.

27:15.131 --> 27:16.698
Look, we'll take care of this right now.

27:16.699 --> 27:18.169
Why should I trust you to do

27:18.170 --> 27:19.321
the right thing after you leave Belize?

27:19.322 --> 27:20.313
Fuck's sake, man!

27:20.314 --> 27:21.850
Listen to me.

27:21.851 --> 27:23.454
- Fuck.
- Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude!

27:23.455 --> 27:25.177
- Cobi, Cobi.
- What are American promises worth?

27:25.178 --> 27:26.874
Where are they going?

27:26.875 --> 27:28.282
All right, here, okay?

27:28.283 --> 27:29.626
Take this and go.

27:29.627 --> 27:30.682
What is that?

27:30.683 --> 27:31.770
No, no, no.

27:31.771 --> 27:33.146
Do you want the money or not?

27:33.147 --> 27:34.489
If you won't let me see what is in the trunk,

27:34.490 --> 27:36.827
I will just talk to the police instead.

27:36.828 --> 27:38.939
What?

27:41.115 --> 27:44.539
Come on, man, we got to get out of here, let's move it.

27:44.540 --> 27:45.755
Hey, hey, hey!

27:45.756 --> 27:46.970
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

27:46.971 --> 27:49.628
What are you doing?

27:51.739 --> 27:54.107
What happened here?

27:54.108 --> 27:55.322
A very minor accident.

27:55.323 --> 27:56.826
But we worked it all out, though.

27:56.827 --> 27:57.947
Is there anybody injured?

27:57.948 --> 27:59.419
No, we are fine.

27:59.420 --> 28:00.987
But I do have to get my grandmother to her treatment.

28:00.988 --> 28:02.875
Are we free to go, Officer?

28:02.876 --> 28:04.283
As long as everybody's happy.

28:04.284 --> 28:05.628
I am happy.

28:05.629 --> 28:06.619
You?

28:06.620 --> 28:08.315
I'm happy.

28:08.316 --> 28:09.338
Yeah, see?

28:09.339 --> 28:10.843
Very well, be careful now.

28:10.844 --> 28:12.060
Mm-hmm.

28:13.309 --> 28:15.387
Good-bye, then.

28:15.388 --> 28:16.955
I'll see you.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.108
Thank you.

28:18.109 --> 28:20.060
Wow.

28:20.061 --> 28:21.691
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

28:21.692 --> 28:23.611
- Un-fucking-believable.
- Have a good afternoon, y'all.

28:23.612 --> 28:24.699
All right?

28:24.700 --> 28:26.204
And sorry about the...

28:26.205 --> 28:27.868
Mm-hmm, right.

28:27.869 --> 28:29.532
See you later.

28:31.933 --> 28:33.980
- "See you later."
- What?

28:33.981 --> 28:35.356
- For real?
- Man, you know what?

28:35.357 --> 28:37.406
I'm not even...

28:42.110 --> 28:44.125
So-so the car's got a little damage,

28:44.126 --> 28:45.916
and we just need to return it for something

28:45.917 --> 28:48.796
a bit more, um, drivable.

28:48.797 --> 28:50.684
Yeah, it was a good thing

28:50.685 --> 28:53.116
we got all that insurance.

30:20.257 --> 30:22.176
Come on, come on.

30:22.177 --> 30:23.968
We're cutting this awfully close.

30:23.969 --> 30:25.471
Finally.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.319
I have everything ready.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.728
I have waited long enough.

30:29.729 --> 30:31.135
What the hell is she doing here?

30:31.136 --> 30:32.672
Turns out Cobi's not just her boy toy,

30:32.673 --> 30:33.984
he's also her millionaire financial advisor.

30:33.985 --> 30:35.808
Jesus Christ, Cobi, what the fuck?

30:35.809 --> 30:37.920
Okay, okay, just go get the flashes and fuses.

30:37.921 --> 30:39.233
I'll take care of this.

30:39.234 --> 30:41.154
God.

30:48.449 --> 30:50.912
- It's all here.
- Uh, I'm sorry, can't...

30:50.913 --> 30:52.371
I'm sorry, I can't help you right now.

30:53.666 --> 30:55.392
Yeah.

30:58.242 --> 30:59.201
Hey.

30:59.202 --> 31:00.161
Hey, go.

31:00.162 --> 31:01.121
Get out of here, go.

31:02.082 --> 31:04.321
Wait a second.

31:04.322 --> 31:06.370
Was that...?

31:12.898 --> 31:14.273
Scram! Out of here!

31:14.274 --> 31:16.225
I do not accept this as an answer.

31:16.226 --> 31:19.586
Okay, well, you're gonna have to... right now, I-I'm afraid.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.249
Did you say you would help me?

31:21.250 --> 31:22.977
This is an emergency.

31:22.978 --> 31:23.937
Another emergency.

31:23.938 --> 31:25.410
It's complicated, okay?

31:25.411 --> 31:26.658
It's bullshit.

31:26.659 --> 31:28.514
We can't just leave him here like this.

31:28.515 --> 31:29.730
The dog will just keep digging him up.

31:29.731 --> 31:31.203
You want the gardener to find him?

31:32.386 --> 31:33.954
So, what the fuck do we do now?

31:33.955 --> 31:35.066
Get a shovel.

31:36.099 --> 31:39.935
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave... right now.

31:45.187 --> 31:47.043
Thank you.

32:00.611 --> 32:02.530
You know what?

32:02.531 --> 32:04.771
Fuck, I've been a real asshole.

32:04.772 --> 32:06.691
I can help you with your paperwork.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.613
- You can?
- Yeah, come on.

32:11.812 --> 32:13.731
Oh, uh, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it...

32:13.732 --> 32:15.715
I can't.

32:15.716 --> 32:16.963
You all right?

32:16.964 --> 32:18.787
Got him? Got him?

32:20.676 --> 32:23.331
Normally when you transfer this
amount of money internationally,

32:23.332 --> 32:25.124
you're subjected to numerous fees.

32:25.125 --> 32:26.788
But since we're going through your company,

32:26.789 --> 32:28.804
- no fees.
- That's right.

32:28.805 --> 32:30.596
Your money is going through a shell company

32:30.597 --> 32:32.516
in the Cayman Islands under our control.

32:34.149 --> 32:36.004
The freezer, let's put him in the freezer.

32:36.005 --> 32:38.277
We're friends, so no fees.

32:38.278 --> 32:41.444
Okay, just sign here, here, here.

32:41.445 --> 32:43.300
Help me unload this.

32:43.301 --> 32:44.836
And this is legal?

32:44.837 --> 32:46.212
Barely.

32:46.213 --> 32:47.396
So yeah.

32:52.229 --> 32:53.700
Fax this to my office in Chicago,

32:53.701 --> 32:55.557
and we'll take care of the rest.

32:57.317 --> 32:58.726
Thank you.

33:03.430 --> 33:05.221
Uh, dry his pants, dry his pants.

33:05.222 --> 33:07.206
- Uh, laundry room,
- The bar, in the bar.

33:10.662 --> 33:13.413
- What the fuck?
- The mutt dug up the body.

33:13.414 --> 33:15.365
- Hello again.
- You remember Angel.

33:15.366 --> 33:16.358
Hey.

33:22.502 --> 33:24.870
Someone's at the gate.

33:26.118 --> 33:27.719
Hello.

33:28.934 --> 33:30.214
Fuck.

33:30.215 --> 33:31.877
I know you are inside.

33:31.878 --> 33:33.349
Why are the police here?

33:33.350 --> 33:35.557
Um, they're here to ask Milo some questions.

33:35.558 --> 33:36.870
You don't need to get involved.

33:36.871 --> 33:38.374
Look, I'm gonna take you out the side door.

33:38.375 --> 33:39.622
Open the gate.

33:39.623 --> 33:40.742
Is she gone?

33:40.743 --> 33:42.502
She's gone, but the cop's here.

33:42.503 --> 33:44.038
- What?
- Cop's here.

33:44.039 --> 33:45.157
Open the gate.

33:45.158 --> 33:46.535
Oh, my God.

33:46.536 --> 33:47.495
Gonna stall her.

33:47.496 --> 33:48.710
Hide the body.

33:48.711 --> 33:50.149
I mean, it's starting to smell.

33:50.150 --> 33:51.911
Let's go, let's go.

33:58.759 --> 34:00.359
It has been good to know you.

34:00.360 --> 34:03.080
It's been good to know you, too.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.359
- Hello.
- Hey.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.599
Let me in, please.

34:18.600 --> 34:22.056
Oh, you know, I-I don't even know the code to this thing.

34:22.056 --> 34:24.295
How do you get in and out?

34:24.295 --> 34:26.471
Oh, uh, we usually have a clicker, and we...

34:26.472 --> 34:28.135
Why don't you get that, then?

34:28.136 --> 34:30.920
We lost the damn thing, and I'm sorry.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.351
So you are just locked in forever.

34:33.351 --> 34:35.592
Hope not.

34:35.592 --> 34:39.369
Maybe you and I can talk here.

34:40.873 --> 34:43.688
Just like in jail.

34:49.018 --> 34:49.864
Oh, fuck.

34:49.864 --> 34:51.880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Milo.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.992
All right, all right, let's both get over here.

35:02.282 --> 35:03.721
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:03.722 --> 35:04.681
Here, let me.

35:06.282 --> 35:08.073
Oh, my God.

35:08.074 --> 35:09.609
Are you sure he's gonna fit?

35:10.326 --> 35:11.989
It's like he's stuck on the side, man...

35:11.990 --> 35:14.344
Get him up higher.

35:14.345 --> 35:16.297
- He's fucking stuck, man.
- Okay, he's stuck, try something.

35:16.298 --> 35:17.769
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- What?

35:17.770 --> 35:19.113
- Hey, uh, some lubricant.
- What?

35:19.114 --> 35:20.522
- Some kind of lubricant.
- Yeah, lubricant.

35:20.523 --> 35:22.857
- Suntan lotion.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:22.858 --> 35:26.345
You realize Belize can be a very dangerous place.

35:26.346 --> 35:29.738
Oh, yeah, yes, but, you know, we're just on vacation.

35:29.739 --> 35:33.575
And so far, this place is pretty fantastic.

35:33.706 --> 35:37.543
What if I told you I will put you in an airplane

35:38.059 --> 35:39.978
back to the United States tonight?

35:39.979 --> 35:43.114
And you will never have to worry about anything here again.

35:43.115 --> 35:45.738
Just you.

35:45.739 --> 35:48.746
Just me?

35:48.747 --> 35:50.986
I can tell you're innocent of anything.

35:51.513 --> 35:52.843
I want to send you home.

35:56.137 --> 35:57.675
You have two daughters, yes?

35:59.339 --> 36:01.131
How do you know about my daughters?

36:01.132 --> 36:03.018
And they are special to you?

36:04.131 --> 36:06.315
I want to send you home tonight.

36:06.316 --> 36:08.523
To be with your daughters.

36:08.524 --> 36:12.361
But first I need to know the truth about everything.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.507
About Milo, about the boat.

36:14.508 --> 36:17.739
Then I promise I will send you home,

36:17.740 --> 36:19.596
far away from here.

36:21.676 --> 36:22.956
Okay, push hard.

36:24.428 --> 36:26.220
He's too tall.

36:29.657 --> 36:33.164
Please do not put me in this position.

36:34.861 --> 36:37.099
You want to go home, yes?

36:37.100 --> 36:40.684
To your two daughters who are everything.

36:40.685 --> 36:42.604
Then tell me.

36:42.605 --> 36:45.676
Tell me the truth about everything,

36:45.677 --> 36:48.044
and I will let you go home.

36:48.045 --> 36:50.444
They are your friends, I understand,

36:50.503 --> 36:52.268
but they are not your family.

36:53.268 --> 36:55.789
Do what you need to for your family now.

37:01.933 --> 37:04.237
It opens.

37:07.281 --> 37:09.389
Maybe one of your friends would like to go home instead.
