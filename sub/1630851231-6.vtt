You--you said that--that I have
a right to be upset.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.499
Why?
- Because I lied.

34:29.632 --> 34:33.636
I testified that your dad
got to the crime scene

34:33.680 --> 34:36.509

- Why?

34:43.037 --> 34:44.647
Why would you say that?

34:50.218 --> 34:53.787
- When your dad was arrested,
Gerrard and Dane told me

34:53.830 --> 34:56.181
that he was a dirty cop
who had stolen all that cash.

34:59.053 --> 35:01.534

My dad could have cut a deal.
