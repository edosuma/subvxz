Mom! Mom!

07:35.789 --> 07:37.498
So it was a dream.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.833
Nemo, are you all right?

07:40.043 --> 07:42.169
Was he having a bad dream again?

07:42.170 --> 07:45.130
Don't tell me you sneaked a piece of pie again?

08:11.574 --> 08:14.284
All right! lt's the circus parade!

Hello there, son.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.672

Want a ride?

09:11.426 --> 09:13.677
Of course! Thanks!

09:14.179 --> 09:17.639
Well then, are you enjoying yourself?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.892
lt's perfect! Right, lcarus?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.936
Ladies and gentlemen in the crowd,

Buy your tickets to the greatest show on Earth as soon as you can!

09:41.331 --> 09:42.414
Please, Dad?

09:42.665 --> 09:44.291
Let's go tomorrow, Nemo.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.293
You always say "tomorrow".

09:46.461 --> 09:48.295
Oh drat! l'm late for my meeting.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.713
l must leave.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.381
Tomorrow, l promise. Tomorrow.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.717
Have a nice day, darling.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.136
Drat. . .

10:00.058 --> 10:00.933
Good night.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.935
Good night, darling.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.984
"Remember your promise"

11:00.243 --> 11:01.326
Nemo!

11:02.412 --> 11:03.537
Where am l?

11:03.538 --> 11:07.124
Listen, Nemo, how many times must l tell you?

11:07.709 --> 11:09.918
What was l doing?

11:14.257 --> 11:15.799
Nemo! Come back at once!

11:17.176 --> 11:18.218
Nemo!

11:24.851 --> 11:28.145
Darling, please have a talk with your son.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.647
He won't listen to me one bit.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.107
Tomorrow. . .

11:32.984 --> 11:34.693
l'll talk to him tomorrow. . .

11:36.279 --> 11:37.404
That was a close call.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.083
lcarus. Wake up.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.001
lcarus!

12:53.231 --> 12:54.398
Look sharp, boys!

12:54.399 --> 12:55.857
The King is coming through!

12:55.858 --> 12:56.775
Attention!

12:56.776 --> 12:57.609
Aye!

13:09.539 --> 13:10.831
Good evening.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.792
Allow me to introduce myself.

13:15.670 --> 13:16.628
Who are you?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.339
l am a professor and a genius.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.925
You may call me Professor Genius.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.094
And this is BonBon.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.262
l am his assistant!

13:25.638 --> 13:26.847
What do you want with me?

13:26.848 --> 13:31.977
We came here to see you on orders from
Morpheus, the King of Slumberland.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.645
King Morpheus?

13:34.105 --> 13:35.021
Slumberland?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.857
lndeed.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.984
Ah, the gift from the Princess.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.653
Wait until the explanations are through.

13:43.448 --> 13:50.662
His Majesty, King Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland,
and keeper of all good dreams.

13:50.663 --> 13:57.502
Cordially invites little Nemo on behalf
of his daughter, Princess Camille,

13:57.712 --> 14:01.673
To be the royal playmate of Camille in Slumberland

14:02.008 --> 14:03.550
Oh. . . thanks.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.971
Princess Camille grows impatient, we must depart immediately.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.556
W-wait a minute!

14:09.891 --> 14:14.102
This princess is a girl, right? But l've never played with a girl before.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.103
What?

14:15.354 --> 14:18.190
She's not just a girl, she's a princess!

14:18.191 --> 14:19.107
Same thing.

14:19.734 --> 14:20.984
A girl is a girl.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.653
And besides, l've never heard of Slumberland.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.867
lndifference over a royal invitation? Unheard of!

14:29.035 --> 14:30.619
Then what about this present?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.037
Present, you say?

14:32.038 --> 14:35.957
Yes! lt is a present from the sweet Princess Camille!

14:35.958 --> 14:38.001
Ooooh, l love presents!

14:38.169 --> 14:41.379
These are delicious dream-sweets made in our special candy factory.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.714
Woah, awesome!

14:44.509 --> 14:46.635
Thanks! l like princesses after all.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.886
l like girls, too.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.060
Yummy!

14:55.061 --> 14:58.772
The King wishes you to ride on his private blimp.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.316
A blimp? A real blimp?

15:02.902 --> 15:06.905
Woah, look at that, lcarus!

15:07.532 --> 15:10.492
lt's real! And it looks just like my model!

15:12.745 --> 15:14.704
Hi!

15:17.291 --> 15:21.086
His Majesty has ordered your presence and is waiting for you.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.797
l'll come! l accept his invitation!

15:23.798 --> 15:25.173
Right, lcarus?

15:26.551 --> 15:28.343
l'd better leave Mom a note.

15:32.306 --> 15:36.059
Please hurry. We cannot delay the departure time.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.397
Hurry, the princess is waiting.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.482
Make haste, make haste, Nemo!

15:44.944 --> 15:45.735
Okay!

15:50.700 --> 15:54.536
Farewell, world. Preparations for ascent complete.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.417
lcarus, look! Those houses look like models!

16:02.587 --> 16:05.255
This is amazing. We're getting higher and higher.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.809
Well then, this place is. . .

16:17.810 --> 16:18.727
The pilothouse!

16:18.728 --> 16:19.436
l know that.

16:20.688 --> 16:25.692
Keep the present altitude and proceed at full speed!

16:26.444 --> 16:28.445
Want to take the wheel, Nemo?

16:28.446 --> 16:29.279
Can l?

16:29.280 --> 16:32.157
Yes, you may. Grab 'hold tight.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.074
Like this?

16:33.075 --> 16:34.576
Yes, that's right.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.661
Yes.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.832
You're good, kid! Keep it up and you'll be an aeronaut someday.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.792
Yahoo!

16:54.055 --> 16:56.556
This feels like aero-acrobatics!

17:04.649 --> 17:06.274
That's Nightmare!

17:06.484 --> 17:07.901
lt's Nightmare!

17:08.444 --> 17:09.444
Oh no!

17:09.612 --> 17:11.029
Emergency!

17:11.030 --> 17:12.822
Grab it tight. Keep calm, Nemo.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.574
Engines at full!

17:14.825 --> 17:18.203
Don't worry. We've outrun Nightmare before.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.579
Nightmare is gonna get us!

17:22.375 --> 17:23.875
lt's the Crystal Clouds!

17:23.876 --> 17:27.087
Thank goodness. Once we enter those clouds, we will be safe.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.255
Full speed ahead!

17:29.256 --> 17:30.840
Hold on tight, Nemo.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.725
A-are we safe now?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.894
Yes, we are. All safe.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.605
See? We're leaving through the clouds!

17:45.773 --> 17:48.733
Lower the engines, prepare for descent.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.203
Welcome to Slumberland!

18:05.918 --> 18:08.503
So this is Slumberland?

18:13.676 --> 18:15.135
They all know me?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.594
Of course they do!

18:17.138 --> 18:18.972
They all came here to welcome you!

18:23.686 --> 18:25.061
Hello!

18:26.564 --> 18:29.190
Hey, buddy, watch where you're going!

18:29.191 --> 18:30.650
Move it!

18:32.111 --> 18:33.194
Who's that?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.280
Someone you should keep away from.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.700
Hey, how's it goin', kid? Feelin' well?

18:38.701 --> 18:39.951
Come play with me!

18:39.952 --> 18:41.786

18:41.787 --> 18:44.164
Old geezer, you say? lnsolent fool!

18:44.165 --> 18:45.457
Well, see ya later!

18:45.458 --> 18:46.416
Okay.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.670
Hey, who was that, Professor?

18:50.838 --> 18:53.173
lt's Flip, the terrible.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.424
Flip?

18:54.425 --> 18:58.094
Please, son, don't speak that name in my presence again.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.564
Little Nemo, to visit His Majesty!

19:11.692 --> 19:12.609
Majesty,

19:12.610 --> 19:17.113
As per your orders, l have brought this boy to you.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.199
This is Nemo.

19:21.827 --> 19:22.786
Your Majesty?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.335
Ahh, of all the foolishness

19:30.336 --> 19:32.378
Go search in the gardens!

19:32.379 --> 19:33.880
l'll search through the palace.

19:33.881 --> 19:34.380
Hurry!

19:34.381 --> 19:35.507
Make haste!

19:35.508 --> 19:36.841
Yes, sir!

19:38.385 --> 19:39.719
W-wait. . .

19:42.515 --> 19:44.182
They're gone.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.561
So you're the kid that was invited here?

19:50.648 --> 19:53.066
What a lucky devil ya are.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.400
You're Flip, aren't you.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.985
Professor says you're "terrible."

19:55.986 --> 19:57.111
S'ppose so.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.323
l'm terribly fun and terribly kind.

20:00.658 --> 20:04.369
And l have the power to make your dreams come true.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.037
So, ya wanna see the King, right?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.038
Yes, l do.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.498
Then let me handle that.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.585
Do you really know where he is?

20:12.795 --> 20:15.213
l know everything, kid.

20:16.298 --> 20:20.593
After all, l'm the only one here who has
a correct map of the entire kingdom.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.512
"Nightmare Land"?

20:26.809 --> 20:28.726
Oh, Slumberland.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.813
C'mon. Let's find the King.

20:31.814 --> 20:32.272
Wait.

20:33.399 --> 20:37.569
Don't worry. We'll probably find the King before the Professor does.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.781
Hey, if that furball doesn't like it, leave 'em behind

20:43.075 --> 20:44.909
No, he's okay. We're coming.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.915
Wow!

20:51.959 --> 20:53.501
Step this way.

20:59.091 --> 20:59.924
Flip!

21:02.261 --> 21:03.595
Everything's upside-down!

21:03.596 --> 21:05.054
lndeed it is.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.017
Follow me.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.520
Umph.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.565
This takes a special technique. Watch closely.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.944
Come. Show me what you've got.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.697
Got'cha.

21:57.900 --> 21:58.608
What's that?

21:59.777 --> 22:01.277
Who could it be?

22:11.664 --> 22:14.123
Something's loose. . .

22:14.792 --> 22:16.125
ls it this?

22:16.502 --> 22:17.961
No, this one. . .

22:18.128 --> 22:20.004
No, not that one either.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.465
Then where is it wonky?

22:22.758 --> 22:24.133
lsn't it the piston gasket?

22:24.426 --> 22:27.512
Ah, that it is. Wrench, please. . .

22:28.931 --> 22:29.639
Wrench.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.933
Screwdriver.

22:31.934 --> 22:40.775
Piston gasket.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.946
Put on the piston gasket and get it in tight.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.447
l think you should make it tighter for good measure.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.782
Anything else?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.242
Oil it up.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.249
This is impressive! lt's all better.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.793
You're a good little mechanic.

22:59.086 --> 22:59.919
Guess so.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.045
l love trains.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.047
So do l!

23:06.218 --> 23:07.552
Hey, the train is leaving.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.250
All aboard!

23:39.251 --> 23:40.877

Okay. Full speed!

24:00.898 --> 24:03.399
Hey there, Moo-Moo, out of the way!

24:32.012 --> 24:33.346
Ouch.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.809
Your Majesty, l'd like to introduce you to-

24:37.810 --> 24:40.144
We've already met.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.481
"Your Majesty"?

24:43.649 --> 24:44.565
You're the king??

24:44.566 --> 24:47.151
Now, don't be so overly formal.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.320
You can call me Morphy.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.530
"Morphy"?

24:50.781 --> 24:52.156
M-Morphy?

24:54.201 --> 24:57.245
Oh, Morphy, this is my best friend, lcarus.

24:58.205 --> 25:01.457
Well, what a cute little fellow you are.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.001
Now then, Nemo, listen well.

25:04.211 --> 25:08.798
l invited you here so that you could become my heir.

25:09.091 --> 25:09.924
Me?

25:10.175 --> 25:11.300
Yes, you.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.887
A prince always bears the mark of the heir.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.682
lt is this golden key.

25:18.183 --> 25:23.271
This key has the ability to open any door in Slumberland.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.816
Wow, thanks, Morphy!

25:27.067 --> 25:29.318
However, l must warn you.

25:29.528 --> 25:33.030
There is one door that you must not open.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.867
lt is the door that bears this symbol.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.869
Solemnly swear to me, boy,

25:37.870 --> 25:42.582
Promise that you will never open the door that bears this symbol.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.084
Yes. l promise.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.962
l promise l won't open it.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.547
Very well.

25:49.882 --> 25:54.594
Now then, Professor, let's have my heir meet the Princess.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.220
Yes, as you wish, your Majesty.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.431
The Princess, eh?

26:06.398 --> 26:11.694
The Rosebud Room. Princess Camellia's room.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.032
The time has arrived.

26:16.033 --> 26:18.242
Now then, let's get you looking your best.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.245
Very good.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.080
Sorry.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.958
Come, Nemo. The Princess is waiting for you.

26:27.169 --> 26:33.382
Listen, be on your best manners. Camellia
is a Princess - don't ever forget that.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.774
Princess, please pardon me.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.027
May l please borrow your attention for just a moment?

26:53.028 --> 26:55.404
This is Little Nemo.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.865
"Little Nemo"?

26:58.075 --> 26:58.783
Come.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.119
Welcome.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.290
So this boy is Nemo.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.595
The present, Nemo.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.807
You know, the cookies.

27:23.225 --> 27:23.933
Oh, yeah.

27:24.935 --> 27:28.646
Thank you, er, l mean, for the cookies, Princess Camellia.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.440
You're welcome. l'm glad you liked them.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.818
Good work, Professor, you may leave.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.447
Pardon me. l'll leave you two kids alone.

27:38.865 --> 27:41.450
Professor! Don't leave me. . .

27:41.743 --> 27:42.868
Have fun then.

27:42.869 --> 27:45.162
See you later, Nemo.

27:55.257 --> 27:55.798
Well!

27:56.133 --> 27:57.174
Wh-what?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.720
Nothing in particular.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.764
lt's just that you're the first.

28:03.765 --> 28:06.225
The first person to enter a kingdom in his underthings.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.062
Underthings? These aren't my underthings!

28:10.272 --> 28:11.647
They're my pajamas!

28:11.898 --> 28:15.943
Oh. But the royal invitation was supposed to apply exclusively to you.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.528
We did not invite a rat.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.654
A rat?

28:20.615 --> 28:22.450
Yes. Your pet rat.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.996
lcarus is not a rat!

28:28.040 --> 28:32.043
And yeah, l'm wearing pajamas! So what's wrong with that?

28:32.044 --> 28:34.795
And whose fault is that anyway? You snatched me from my bed!

28:34.796 --> 28:38.257
You may be a princess and all, but that
gives you no right to treat me like this!

28:40.427 --> 28:41.844
What is it?

28:42.721 --> 28:44.680
You're rather amusing.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.477
And you're absolutely right.

28:49.644 --> 28:53.022
Although l invited you l never specified that you dress formally.

28:53.815 --> 28:54.857
And besides. . .

28:56.276 --> 28:57.818
What is it this time?

28:57.819 --> 28:59.570
Your underthings are rather charming.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.530
They're pajamas, l said!

29:02.199 --> 29:03.783
Come, follow me, Nemo.

29:04.034 --> 29:04.867
Hurry.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.620
l will show you around Slumberland.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.041
Your rat wants to accompany us, it seems.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.085
He's not a rat.

29:14.086 --> 29:14.877
His name is lcarus.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.295
And call him by name, won't you!

29:16.296 --> 29:17.546
He's my best friend.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.799
Very well. Excuse me.

29:19.800 --> 29:20.758
l apologize.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.803
lf you're gonna apologize, apologize to the rat, not me.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.224
Er, l mean,

29:28.225 --> 29:29.308
l didn't mean. . .

29:32.312 --> 29:35.940
lcarus, l didn't mean it.

29:36.566 --> 29:37.733
We're best friends, aren't we?

29:40.779 --> 29:42.154
lcarus!

29:49.246 --> 29:50.621
Come down, lcarus.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.914
l'm begging you!

29:54.126 --> 29:55.084
l'm sorry.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.461
Fine. Then l'll climb up there.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.340
lcarus, hold it!

30:03.885 --> 30:04.760
Got'cha!

30:07.806 --> 30:08.764
Nemo!

30:14.604 --> 30:16.063
So his name is lcarus?

30:16.648 --> 30:17.231
Yes.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.484
You are SO precious.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.071
Oh, it's an evening drizzle.

31:47.447 --> 31:51.075
We're having so much fun that the Rain Fairies are jealous.

31:51.368 --> 31:52.451
BonBon!

32:36.538 --> 32:37.997
lsn't it pretty?

32:38.290 --> 32:40.040
l love this place.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.501
Yes, it's pretty beyond words!

32:55.307 --> 32:57.516
Just in time for lessons.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.559
"Lessons"?

32:58.560 --> 33:00.019
But l hate school.

33:00.020 --> 33:03.314
lf you're going to be a prince you need to learn how to act like one.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.398
Step this way.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.066
But what about lcarus?

33:06.067 --> 33:07.985
l'll take care of him. Have fun.

33:12.032 --> 33:12.990
Who are these people?

33:12.991 --> 33:15.284
They are all your teachers.

33:16.202 --> 33:18.662
Now, let's begin the lessons.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.186
Sit up straight and let your spoon glide.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.438
We have lunch here at 12:30.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.324
Very nice.

33:57.118 --> 33:57.910
Oh dear.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.787
Next we dance!

34:37.450 --> 34:39.076
En garde!

34:39.828 --> 34:42.329
Advance! Recovery!

34:52.132 --> 34:54.967
Advance! Recovery! Advance! Recovery!

34:54.968 --> 34:57.094
Hey, jump!

35:08.314 --> 35:10.149
"Stand when a lady enters the room."

35:10.150 --> 35:11.692
"Don't spit in front of others."

35:11.860 --> 35:12.860
"Sit up straight."

35:12.861 --> 35:13.986
"Don't yell indoors."

35:13.987 --> 35:15.487
"Open doors for the elderly."

35:15.488 --> 35:16.905
"Don't pick your nose."

35:30.628 --> 35:32.963
Sit up straight! Straight, boy!

35:35.008 --> 35:36.383
More dancing?

36:07.040 --> 36:10.000
Prince lessons ain't easy, eh?

36:10.919 --> 36:13.337
Let's have some pranking lessons too. See there!

36:14.547 --> 36:17.883
They'll come looking for you soon. Wear these.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.927
Ta-daaah.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.470
Flip Jr. is born!

36:22.806 --> 36:23.639
Follow me.

36:23.807 --> 36:24.681
Where are we going?

36:24.682 --> 36:26.183
Just trust me.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.728
lt's my house. Home, sweet home.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.523
But it's a police station.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.024
Won't we get caught?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.192
We'll be fine.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.195
Don't worry, l said.

36:39.572 --> 36:42.157
The real fun begins here.

36:48.581 --> 36:49.540
What the?

36:50.250 --> 36:50.958
Why you. . .

36:50.959 --> 36:52.918
Ow! What was that for?

36:58.550 --> 36:59.800
Now you've done it!

37:12.564 --> 37:15.482
Wait, wait, l'll go this way.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.819
Hey, there are two Flips!

37:22.073 --> 37:23.699
Stop, you!

37:28.413 --> 37:30.622
Stop, you!!

37:30.623 --> 37:32.082
This way.

37:33.293 --> 37:36.628
Hey, Flap, wake up!

37:36.629 --> 37:39.256
You've got two passengers. Step on it!

37:44.429 --> 37:45.512
You can do it.

37:48.975 --> 37:49.766
Go!

37:49.767 --> 37:51.393
High in the sky!

37:51.644 --> 37:52.853
Hurry, Flap!

37:58.735 --> 38:01.945
There they are!

38:02.780 --> 38:04.531
Hurry there, boy.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.411
FLY!

38:10.163 --> 38:11.747
Grab ahold, boy.

38:15.168 --> 38:17.127
Sorry, gentlemen.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.130
Let's play again some other time.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.593
Hey, look. Music.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.595
lt's an orchestra.

38:26.596 --> 38:30.557
This is it. This is what we call a golden opportunity.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.313
Okay.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.441
Now, it's your turn.

38:39.609 --> 38:40.400
What should l do?

38:40.401 --> 38:41.902
Do this.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.034
Do you understand?

38:49.535 --> 38:51.662
Yes, yes, that's right.

39:01.631 --> 39:04.800
That's very good. You're a natural, kid!

39:05.510 --> 39:08.178
You'll be famous in no time, kid. Just like me.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.597
You're wanted? But why?

39:10.848 --> 39:12.808
l was too ingenious for their own good.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.856
Wow, there's lots of towers out here.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.525
That ain't it, boy.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.442
Those're fireworks.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.486
They're all set up to honor you.

39:24.988 --> 39:27.572
Guess it's time for a little rehearsal.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.657
Good idea!

39:44.841 --> 39:47.968
What gorgeous fireworks! Fit for a prince!

40:04.610 --> 40:06.987
Oops. Looks like we got some unwanted attention.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.115
See ya later Flap.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.117
Come, hurry!

40:34.307 --> 40:35.724
Come on, we're going in.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.776
Outsmarting those guys is like taking candy from a baby.

40:46.486 --> 40:47.402
Come, let's go.

40:47.737 --> 40:48.737
Where to?

40:48.738 --> 40:51.448
To an even more amusing place.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.287
lt's haunted.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.872
Cut it out, Flip.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.042
This place is kind of creepy.

41:02.210 --> 41:06.880
Don't be scared. The great Flip is with
ya. And the real fun begins now.

41:15.348 --> 41:18.809
Woah there. .. Boy! Are ya okay?

41:19.060 --> 41:20.310
Are ya okay?

41:23.189 --> 41:24.648
l guess so.

41:25.191 --> 41:28.527
That was quite a spill ya just took.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.779
Look up there.

41:32.990 --> 41:36.618
Looks like you just ran into a big door, kid.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.787
l've got a bad feeling about this.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.082
l think this is the door the King was telling me about.

41:42.375 --> 41:43.333
What?

41:43.835 --> 41:48.088
He told me not to open the door that
has the same symbol as this key.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.925
Let's open it.

41:52.718 --> 41:53.009
But we-

41:53.010 --> 41:55.011
Don't ya wanna know what's inside of it?

41:55.012 --> 42:00.892
l'm sure that there's something really, really
big on the other side of this door.

42:00.893 --> 42:01.852
Are you sure?

42:01.853 --> 42:03.353
Of course l'm sure.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.605
We'll just take a peek.

42:05.606 --> 42:06.398
What do ya say?

42:06.399 --> 42:09.693
But l promised the king.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.153
l swore not to open it.

42:11.154 --> 42:14.030
But l'll keep quiet and he'll never find out.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.116
Just trust me, kid.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.576
l guess you're right. . .

42:18.411 --> 42:20.370
A little peek wouldn't hurt.

42:20.580 --> 42:21.580
That's a good boy.

42:21.581 --> 42:23.123
l'll give ya a boost.

42:30.590 --> 42:32.299
Hurry and open it, you're heavy, kid!

42:32.300 --> 42:33.383
lt's a tough lock.

42:34.844 --> 42:36.595
Well? ls it open?

42:44.312 --> 42:46.104
Look. See that?

43:06.792 --> 43:08.919
Good. Open it.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.421
But.. . we're just taking a peek.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.048
Yeah, l know that.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.844
Don't just stand there, help me.

43:44.664 --> 43:45.330
Oh no!

43:49.627 --> 43:50.585
That was close.

43:52.922 --> 43:55.340
l'm leaving. Mommy's calling me!

43:55.675 --> 43:56.633
Flip, wait!

43:56.926 --> 43:58.343
l need to take the key out!

44:04.517 --> 44:05.976
Flip, don't go!

44:06.978 --> 44:08.103
Flip!

44:41.554 --> 44:43.555
l wonder where that boy went.

44:43.556 --> 44:46.349
The coronation ceremony is about to begin!

44:53.858 --> 44:57.694
His royal highness, King Morpheus!

44:58.195 --> 45:01.364
Prosperity to Slumberland!

45:03.326 --> 45:08.747
My beloved subjects, l welcome you all
to my palace for this special ceremony.

45:08.748 --> 45:12.042
The prince can't be late to his own coronation!

45:18.758 --> 45:21.009
Move it, out of the way!

45:23.596 --> 45:25.430
Ah, made it just in time.

45:25.598 --> 45:28.350
Just in time? You're just very late!

45:28.351 --> 45:31.269
And in such tasteless clothes too!

45:31.479 --> 45:32.103
But.. .

45:32.104 --> 45:33.980
No time for excuses!

45:35.066 --> 45:37.567
We can't waste a single second!

45:37.735 --> 45:39.027
Hurry, hurry.

45:39.028 --> 45:40.111
Wait. . .

45:40.112 --> 45:42.739
Don't take my clothes off.

45:43.032 --> 45:44.324
Stop it.

45:45.951 --> 45:48.203
At last he looks like a proper prince.

46:10.351 --> 46:12.352
Calm down. Stay strong.

46:20.653 --> 46:22.237
Come to me.

46:27.076 --> 46:29.244
Oh, l can't stand to watch.

46:30.162 --> 46:34.249
Subjects of Slumberland, allow me to introduce

46:34.417 --> 46:38.503
The worthy heir l have chosen for my throne, Nemo.

46:41.132 --> 46:45.468
As the heir to my throne, he will be henceforth called "Prince Nemo."

46:45.678 --> 46:49.931
He must protect help Slumberland from Nightmare.

46:50.141 --> 46:54.436
And, like this scepter, he is one of a kind.

46:54.437 --> 46:57.814
Bow down to him as you do to me.

46:58.566 --> 46:59.858
Step back.

47:00.317 --> 47:06.072
My heir, behold for yourself the divine powers of my scepter

47:09.160 --> 47:12.829
Jazama Pajama, Pajama Jazama.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.582
Kimera-kazam, imera-tazam.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.917
Paja-paja-jazam

47:17.918 --> 47:22.422
Shazama, pajama, pajama!

47:44.361 --> 47:46.321
Let me warn you all,

47:46.614 --> 47:52.327
The only ones who are able to use this
scepter are myself and Prince Nemo.

47:54.079 --> 47:56.414
But he's just a kid. . .

47:56.582 --> 47:59.584
But he is still young and fragile.

48:00.169 --> 48:10.220
This scepter will be bequeathed to Prince Nemo only
when he is old enough and strong enough to wield it.

48:13.641 --> 48:17.685
Nemo, the time has arrived. Step forward, my boy.

48:21.065 --> 48:23.274
l present you with this crown,

48:23.275 --> 48:27.028
Signifying that you now are in the royal family of Slumberland.

48:27.363 --> 48:29.072
Prince Nemo.

48:30.658 --> 48:37.163
As prince, your duty is to protect the key l gave
you and see that no harm comes from it.

48:38.624 --> 48:42.168
Hooray! Hooray!

48:45.089 --> 48:47.590
Let the festivities begin!

48:48.008 --> 48:51.219
Let's dance the night away!

49:45.190 --> 49:48.860
As the king, l cannot let the Professor out-dance me.

49:48.861 --> 49:50.820
Do you not agree, Nemo?

49:50.821 --> 49:52.447
Hold this for me.

49:52.448 --> 49:52.989
Um. . .

50:22.895 --> 50:23.269
Hey.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.396
Doin' fine?

50:25.397 --> 50:26.648
Oh, Flip. . .

50:26.649 --> 50:29.484
That's a pretty thing you've got there. Let me see it.

50:29.652 --> 50:30.735
Don't touch it!

50:30.903 --> 50:32.528
Did you just say something, Nemo?

50:32.529 --> 50:35.657
Eh, uh, nothing really.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.033
Just talking to myself.

50:44.500 --> 50:45.875
l shouldn't have opened it.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.046
l need to get that key back!

50:50.422 --> 50:52.715
Hold this for me. l'll be right back!

50:53.050 --> 50:54.884
Nemo, where are you going?

50:57.680 --> 50:58.721
lcarus!

51:06.563 --> 51:07.897
l don't have time to explain.

51:57.281 --> 51:58.448
What's wrong?

51:59.867 --> 52:01.159
King Morpheus!

52:01.160 --> 52:03.661
Please stop the party! Please, stop!

52:06.999 --> 52:08.583
Nemo, did something happen?

52:10.502 --> 52:11.753
Your highness!

52:11.754 --> 52:13.421
King Morpheus!

52:16.967 --> 52:19.177
Want to dance too, lcarus?

52:19.178 --> 52:22.722
Let me through. . . move it, please

52:23.599 --> 52:24.974
Please, let me through!

52:28.312 --> 52:29.562
King Morpheus!

52:41.366 --> 52:42.992
lt's Nightmare!

52:54.671 --> 52:55.713
Father!

52:57.257 --> 53:00.051
Nemo, give me the scepter!

53:00.052 --> 53:01.844
Right away!

53:03.388 --> 53:06.182
Nemo, hurry!

53:06.809 --> 53:08.893
Here it is! Take it. . .

53:10.687 --> 53:12.188
Father!

53:19.947 --> 53:21.739
King Morpheus!

53:34.086 --> 53:35.378
Father!

53:39.550 --> 53:42.468
Nightmare. . . how did he get here?

53:45.722 --> 53:47.557
Who opened that door!

53:50.394 --> 53:52.562
He must have done it!

53:53.522 --> 53:55.273
Get him!

53:55.274 --> 53:56.691
Get him now!

53:56.692 --> 53:58.734
But it wasn't me.

53:58.735 --> 54:00.528
Nemo did it.

54:00.529 --> 54:02.446
Flip, what are you saying?

54:02.447 --> 54:03.614
l'm sayin' the truth.

54:03.615 --> 54:05.283
l saw him do it with my own eyes.

54:05.576 --> 54:07.118
N-no! lt wasn't me!

54:07.119 --> 54:08.452
lt was Flip!

54:08.453 --> 54:10.663
But Nemo was the keeper of the key!

54:10.873 --> 54:11.706
Nemo.. .

54:12.082 --> 54:13.040
Nemo?

54:13.584 --> 54:14.500
No!

54:14.835 --> 54:16.294
lt-it wasn't me!

54:16.879 --> 54:17.962
l-it wasn't!

54:20.883 --> 54:21.591
No. . .

54:22.593 --> 54:26.387
You did it. . . you. . . you.. .

54:27.764 --> 54:28.973
NO!!

54:34.563 --> 54:36.272
So it was a dream. . .

54:44.114 --> 54:49.911
Nemo.. .

54:49.912 --> 54:51.120
King Morpheus?

54:53.498 --> 54:54.624
Where are you?

55:01.632 --> 55:15.853
Nemo.. .

55:24.696 --> 55:25.988
Help me!

55:26.698 --> 55:28.449
Help me, somebody!

56:22.879 --> 56:24.380
King Morpheus. . .

56:29.136 --> 56:31.053
l really am sorry.

56:44.151 --> 56:45.234
What's that?

56:50.449 --> 56:52.408
That's it! lt's the Professor.

56:52.576 --> 56:53.451
Professor!

56:54.161 --> 56:55.453
lt's Nemo!

56:55.454 --> 56:56.412
This way!

56:57.247 --> 56:58.247
Come this way!

56:58.707 --> 56:59.498
Nemo?

56:59.499 --> 57:00.583
Nemo!

57:01.001 --> 57:01.834
Professor!

57:02.711 --> 57:03.544
ls it you?

57:05.297 --> 57:06.130
Take my hand.

57:12.596 --> 57:15.806
Nemo! l thought l'd never see you again.

57:15.807 --> 57:17.224
Where's the king?

57:17.601 --> 57:18.893
Far away.

57:19.311 --> 57:21.562
He was taken away to Nightmare Land.

57:21.897 --> 57:24.440
The entire kingdom is in mourning.

57:24.775 --> 57:25.775
lt's all my fault.

57:26.276 --> 57:27.443
l did something wrong.

57:28.028 --> 57:30.112
No, it wasn't you.

57:30.489 --> 57:32.114
Flip is at fault.

57:32.324 --> 57:34.992
No. l made a promise to the king.

57:35.327 --> 57:37.161
But l broke that promise.

57:38.205 --> 57:40.247
l'll go find the king.

57:41.625 --> 57:46.462
But, without the scepter, there is no hope of you saving him.

57:46.671 --> 57:47.588
The scepter?

57:48.173 --> 57:49.673
l've got it right here!

57:49.674 --> 57:50.466
See?

57:51.343 --> 57:52.968
You had it?

57:52.969 --> 57:55.304
Let's deliver it to the king at once!

57:56.515 --> 57:57.515
lt's no use.

57:57.766 --> 58:00.434
We don't know where Nightmare Land is.

58:00.769 --> 58:03.312
That's it! Flip has a map.

58:03.939 --> 58:05.064
He does?

58:05.065 --> 58:05.981
l saw it.

58:05.982 --> 58:08.484
What horrible timing.

58:08.777 --> 58:12.071
He is about to be banished to outer space!

58:12.489 --> 58:14.323
We need to stop it! Let's be fast!

58:15.367 --> 58:16.617
Row! Row!

58:17.953 --> 58:21.330
Row? Oh, l see. Okay then.

58:37.597 --> 58:39.890
A blindfold? Surely you jest.

58:39.891 --> 58:41.851
Don't make me miss out on the show.

58:42.519 --> 58:43.978
Load the cannon!

58:43.979 --> 58:45.563
What're ya doing?

58:46.356 --> 58:46.981
Let me. . .

58:48.358 --> 58:50.192
l'm still smoking!

58:57.284 --> 58:59.285
Hey, lemme out!

58:59.286 --> 59:00.369
Help me!

59:00.370 --> 59:02.246
l'll give ya anything.

59:02.247 --> 59:03.372
Help. . .

59:06.251 --> 59:07.126
Ready!

59:10.005 --> 59:11.338
Hurry!

59:15.177 --> 59:16.385
Fire!

59:21.183 --> 59:22.892
lcarus! Where did you come from?

59:24.060 --> 59:25.436
Where's Nemo?

59:25.437 --> 59:28.522
Wait! Wait! Hold up!

59:29.149 --> 59:30.524
Don't shoot the cannon!

59:30.942 --> 59:31.734
Nemo!

59:31.943 --> 59:33.402
lt's the scepter!

59:33.653 --> 59:34.778
Let Flip free!

59:34.779 --> 59:35.571
What did you say?

59:36.865 --> 59:38.407
l'm gonna go find the king.

59:38.950 --> 59:40.451
So you need to let Flip out.

59:40.452 --> 59:41.410
But why?

59:42.329 --> 59:44.580
He has a map to Nightmare Land.

59:47.209 --> 59:48.542
Cancel the sentence!

59:59.638 --> 1:00:02.181
These're brand label clothes, man!

1:00:04.184 --> 1:00:06.018
Now, hand it over, Flip.

1:00:06.186 --> 1:00:07.269
Hand over what?

1:00:07.479 --> 1:00:09.021
The map to Nightmare Land.

1:00:09.231 --> 1:00:10.856
Oh, that thing.

1:00:12.359 --> 1:00:13.984
How much are ya willing to pay?

1:00:13.985 --> 1:00:14.777
Flip!

1:00:14.778 --> 1:00:15.861
Hand it over!

1:00:16.112 --> 1:00:19.573
Oh, fine, l get it. You can have it.

1:00:19.783 --> 1:00:21.283
Use it well.

1:00:21.785 --> 1:00:24.119
Hey, easy, be gentle, man!

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:25.329
Hands off.

1:00:26.122 --> 1:00:27.081
lsn't it fun?

1:00:27.249 --> 1:00:28.791
What's this supposed to mean?

1:00:29.251 --> 1:00:31.335
Ah yes, forgot to mention it,

1:00:32.504 --> 1:00:35.005
That map doesn't work for just anyone.

1:00:35.006 --> 1:00:39.468
lt's got a super uncrackable code attached to it.

1:00:39.928 --> 1:00:41.845
Then you'll have to come with us.

1:00:41.846 --> 1:00:44.098
Me? To Nightmare Land?

1:00:45.225 --> 1:00:48.894
Sorry, but l've got errands to run. People to visit.

1:00:49.271 --> 1:00:50.896
Prepare the cannon!

1:00:51.398 --> 1:00:54.400
Oh fine, l guess l can come along.

1:00:54.401 --> 1:00:56.360
lf ya make me captain, that is.

1:00:56.361 --> 1:00:59.613
After all, l'm the only one who can read the map.

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:02.908
ls this lovely princess coming along?

1:01:03.159 --> 1:01:04.660
You can hold my cigars for me.

1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:13.377
Aww, you look even prettier when you're angry.

1:01:19.968 --> 1:01:21.719
Of course l'm coming along.

1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:25.514
You are forbidden to smoke while on the voyage!

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:37.526
Anchors aweigh! To Nightmare Land!

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:38.444
Two degrees right.

1:01:38.445 --> 1:01:39.778
Aye-aye, Captain!

1:01:39.779 --> 1:01:40.863
Watch the aft!

1:01:40.864 --> 1:01:42.531
Aye-aye, sir!

1:01:46.536 --> 1:01:48.662
Father, l hope you're safe.. .

1:01:49.331 --> 1:01:51.540
Don't worry. He'll be okay.

1:01:59.758 --> 1:02:02.343
Sail on, fine ship.

1:02:02.344 --> 1:02:04.887
l am the Captain!

1:02:04.888 --> 1:02:07.097
Anything nautical is my specialty.

1:02:07.098 --> 1:02:08.349
Owww.

1:02:08.350 --> 1:02:10.976
Would you please take this more seriously?

1:02:12.103 --> 1:02:14.021
Yes, absolutely, your majestyness.

1:02:14.022 --> 1:02:15.898
Er, princess. . .

1:02:26.493 --> 1:02:28.410
What's this noise?

1:02:34.626 --> 1:02:37.169
Flip! Wake up! You need to take the wheel!

1:02:44.469 --> 1:02:45.761
Flip! Help me!

1:02:45.762 --> 1:02:48.013
Grab it! Grab on tight!

1:03:28.805 --> 1:03:30.931
Are you all okay?

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:32.516
Yes, barely.

1:03:34.102 --> 1:03:37.271
Well! My pretty dress is all ruined!

1:03:45.697 --> 1:03:47.114
Where are we?

1:03:47.115 --> 1:03:50.826
From the looks of things, we're in Nightmare Land.

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:53.954
Really? Ah, yes, of course we are.

1:03:54.205 --> 1:03:56.373
See? l brought ya here safe.

1:04:02.338 --> 1:04:04.047
Oh no! Looks like goblins!

1:04:04.048 --> 1:04:06.842
Those ARE goblins!

1:04:07.719 --> 1:04:08.677
Unhand me!

1:04:12.724 --> 1:04:14.266
We need to help her!

1:04:18.438 --> 1:04:19.897
Pull hard, Professor!

1:04:25.570 --> 1:04:29.114
Ah-hah! They were scared of the scepter!

1:04:29.365 --> 1:04:30.574
Get away from me!

1:04:32.494 --> 1:04:33.911
Flip, the map!

1:04:34.162 --> 1:04:36.038
The faster we move, the better.

1:04:36.039 --> 1:04:39.333
l get it. Hold your horses. . .

1:04:39.584 --> 1:04:40.918
What happened, Flip?

1:04:40.919 --> 1:04:43.337
Uh, nothing!

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:45.839
The map says. . . this way.

1:04:46.466 --> 1:04:50.052
Watch your step. Especially be wary of the goblins.

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:08.028
l hate this place. lt looks haunted.

1:05:08.613 --> 1:05:11.782
Flip, are there goblins in this forest?

1:05:11.783 --> 1:05:15.202
Naw, there ain't any goblins around here.

1:05:22.293 --> 1:05:24.878
Which way is Nightmare Castle?

1:05:27.966 --> 1:05:31.760
Hey, no peeking!

1:05:32.512 --> 1:05:36.223
Just as l thought. Ah, er, this way.

1:05:43.147 --> 1:05:45.190
lt's a dead end!

1:05:46.442 --> 1:05:48.527
Flip! Wonder where he went?

1:05:48.528 --> 1:05:50.487
Flip! Flip!

1:05:54.701 --> 1:05:56.410
Let's see then. . .

1:05:56.661 --> 1:05:58.579
The forest is here.

1:05:58.580 --> 1:06:00.247
The swamp is here.

1:06:00.248 --> 1:06:01.707
The mountains are here.

1:06:01.708 --> 1:06:04.960
And Nightmare Castle is here. . .

1:06:06.588 --> 1:06:08.380
No, it's not there.

1:06:08.590 --> 1:06:09.840
lt's farther north.

1:06:09.841 --> 1:06:10.966
Oh, thanks.

1:06:12.719 --> 1:06:14.428
Get away, monster!

1:06:21.352 --> 1:06:22.436
What's wrong?

1:06:22.437 --> 1:06:24.313
Oh dear, we scared him to sleep.

1:06:29.861 --> 1:06:30.694
Oh no!

1:06:33.072 --> 1:06:34.406
Let Flip go!

1:06:34.616 --> 1:06:36.825
lt's the scepter! Run for it!

1:06:42.081 --> 1:06:43.707
Flip, are you okay?

1:06:43.875 --> 1:06:45.334
Yeah, l'm fine.

1:06:45.501 --> 1:06:48.128
Wandering off by yourself is dangerous!

1:06:49.172 --> 1:06:51.048
You were sneaking in a smoke, weren't you!

1:06:51.049 --> 1:06:53.967
Those monsters forced me to smoke against my will.

1:06:54.344 --> 1:06:55.761
No, no, we'd never do that.

1:06:55.762 --> 1:06:57.387
lt wasn't us!

1:06:57.388 --> 1:06:58.555
But you ARE goblins.

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:03.769
Stop it, stop it, stop that noise!

1:07:03.770 --> 1:07:05.270
Our ears hurt!

1:07:06.105 --> 1:07:07.648
Don't do that again!

1:07:07.649 --> 1:07:09.316
We're your friends.

1:07:09.317 --> 1:07:10.776
We're good goblins.

1:07:10.777 --> 1:07:12.027
Are you okay?

1:07:12.028 --> 1:07:14.863
We're okay! We're a-okay!

1:07:14.864 --> 1:07:16.198
But these guys are goblins!

1:07:16.199 --> 1:07:17.658
They attacked me out of nowhere

1:07:17.659 --> 1:07:20.118
And they forced me to smoke, l'm telling ya!

1:07:20.119 --> 1:07:21.411
We didn't attack him!

1:07:21.412 --> 1:07:23.372
And we didn't force him to smoke either!

1:07:23.373 --> 1:07:25.749
All we did was help him draw the map!

1:07:26.084 --> 1:07:27.292
What?

1:07:27.543 --> 1:07:29.628
Er, l. . .

1:07:29.921 --> 1:07:33.632
We are shape-shifting good goblins, you see.

1:07:33.883 --> 1:07:34.675
Really?

1:07:34.676 --> 1:07:35.842
Exactly!

1:07:36.052 --> 1:07:37.552
l'm Umpu.

1:07:37.553 --> 1:07:39.054
l'm Umpa.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:40.263
l'm Umpe.

1:07:40.264 --> 1:07:41.765
And l'm Umpi!

1:07:42.433 --> 1:07:43.350
Well!

1:07:43.351 --> 1:07:44.768
One, two, and three!

1:08:31.441 --> 1:08:32.482
How silly.

1:08:32.817 --> 1:08:34.526
Nightmare is. ..

1:08:34.527 --> 1:08:36.153
Very cruel and a liar!

1:08:36.154 --> 1:08:39.197
He's so scary that we ran away from him!

1:08:39.198 --> 1:08:42.492
But one of our friends is still trapped in the castle.

1:08:42.702 --> 1:08:45.412
So we wanna go back and save him.

1:08:45.705 --> 1:08:49.166
Nightmare is very frightened of that scepter.

1:08:49.333 --> 1:08:53.170
That's why we want you to let us come with you!

1:08:53.171 --> 1:08:54.087
Very well.

1:08:54.338 --> 1:08:57.424
We know the safest way to get there - we'll guide you.

1:08:57.425 --> 1:09:00.135
Not so fast, l'M the guide.

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:02.679
Not anymore. You're fired.

1:09:03.306 --> 1:09:04.806
l humbly accept your offer.

1:09:04.807 --> 1:09:09.102
Yahoo! We got ourselves a good job!

1:09:09.562 --> 1:09:11.188
Then what should l do?

1:09:11.981 --> 1:09:13.398
You will carry our belongings.

1:09:24.494 --> 1:09:26.077
Do you want me to help, Flip?

1:09:26.078 --> 1:09:29.206
No thanks. lt may be demeaning, but it's the only job l've got left.

1:09:48.392 --> 1:09:52.187
l have a question about the spell used with the scepter.

1:09:52.188 --> 1:09:53.855
Jazama shazama. . .

1:09:53.856 --> 1:09:56.149
No. The second word is "Pajama".

1:09:56.526 --> 1:09:58.860
l remember that because you made fun of my pajamas.

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:01.238
Not so loud!

1:10:01.906 --> 1:10:05.033
Nightmare most likely has spies around these parts.

1:10:05.034 --> 1:10:09.621
We need to let Nightmare think that Nemo
is very adept at using the scepter.

1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:13.834
Yeah, can ya keep it down?

1:10:14.293 --> 1:10:17.796
Ya make me carry things during the
day, then ya keep me up at night.

1:10:17.797 --> 1:10:19.047
l've had enough!

1:10:19.048 --> 1:10:20.757
A DOG gets better treatment. . .

1:10:28.057 --> 1:10:29.474
Nemo!

1:10:30.226 --> 1:10:31.434
lt's an ambush!

1:10:31.435 --> 1:10:32.561
Flip!

1:10:32.562 --> 1:10:33.562
Help me!

1:10:33.563 --> 1:10:34.521
Nemo.. .

1:10:35.523 --> 1:10:36.606
Let me go!

1:10:37.066 --> 1:10:37.899
Flip!

1:10:40.069 --> 1:10:41.194
This way!

1:10:41.779 --> 1:10:45.031
Let me go! l promise l won't smoke again!

1:10:54.792 --> 1:11:06.761
Jazama-Pajama!

1:11:08.723 --> 1:11:11.224
Dear Princess, l will protect you!

1:11:13.728 --> 1:11:15.103
Professor!

1:11:15.104 --> 1:11:17.439
Princess! Run away, run away!

1:11:18.691 --> 1:11:20.275
Go away! Go away!

1:11:20.276 --> 1:11:23.069
Princess! Let her go!

1:11:24.113 --> 1:11:25.280
Nemo!

1:11:25.448 --> 1:11:26.573
Princess!

1:11:27.617 --> 1:11:29.451
Nemo, help me!

1:11:33.122 --> 1:11:37.542
Jazama-Pajama!

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:45.842
The scepter!

1:11:51.766 --> 1:11:53.099
What a weird dream.

1:11:59.315 --> 1:12:01.483
Are you okay, Nemo?

1:12:02.026 --> 1:12:03.360
What are you doing here?

1:12:03.361 --> 1:12:04.986
We've been here all along.

1:12:05.321 --> 1:12:07.489
So l'm still dreaming then?

1:12:07.490 --> 1:12:09.574
Dreaming? What's dreaming?

1:12:09.784 --> 1:12:10.784
Well, it's. . .

1:12:10.785 --> 1:12:13.995
l get it! This place is called a "dream"!

1:12:14.163 --> 1:12:15.789
Ohhh, l get it.

1:12:15.790 --> 1:12:17.332
Exactly, exactly.

1:12:17.333 --> 1:12:19.125
l thought so all along!

1:12:22.046 --> 1:12:23.213
Princess. . .

1:12:29.679 --> 1:12:32.764
Jazama-Pajama!

1:12:35.559 --> 1:12:37.394
Hey, it's Unpo!

1:12:37.395 --> 1:12:38.561
lt's Unpo!

1:12:38.562 --> 1:12:40.146
l thought so all along!

1:12:40.564 --> 1:12:42.899
Unpo! Were you okay?

1:12:43.275 --> 1:12:44.901
Unpo!

1:12:47.279 --> 1:12:50.865
l am so happy to see you all again.

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:57.914
Wait, is that your friend you were looking for?

1:12:58.082 --> 1:13:01.334
Yes, he's the friend that was left behind.

1:13:01.711 --> 1:13:04.921
l'm very pleased to see you, l'm Unpo

1:13:05.089 --> 1:13:06.548
Hi. l'm Nemo.

1:13:06.841 --> 1:13:08.258
So you're Nemo!

1:13:08.467 --> 1:13:11.678
l have a letter from you, from King Morpheus.

1:13:11.929 --> 1:13:14.556
From the King? Where is he right now?

1:13:14.807 --> 1:13:19.936
The last time l saw him, he was locked up in Nightmare Castle.

1:13:20.604 --> 1:13:21.479
Where's the Princess?

1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:22.480
Where's the Professor?

1:13:22.481 --> 1:13:23.648
Princess?

1:13:23.816 --> 1:13:24.983
Let me see the letter!

1:13:24.984 --> 1:13:26.359
Here it is.

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:30.071
This is the spell that goes with the scepter!

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:35.785
lt's a secret incantation. When spoken,
it releases immeasurable power.

1:13:36.078 --> 1:13:37.662
Enough power to defeat Nightmare.

1:13:38.706 --> 1:13:39.539
That's wonderful!

1:13:39.749 --> 1:13:41.082
But why did the King send me this?

1:13:42.001 --> 1:13:44.461
Let's go to Nightmare Castle at once!

1:13:44.628 --> 1:13:46.212
The King is waiting for us!

1:13:46.505 --> 1:13:49.466
Yay! Nightmare!

1:13:56.348 --> 1:13:57.724
Owww, that noise hurts!

1:13:57.725 --> 1:13:59.476
Stop making the noise!

1:13:59.477 --> 1:14:00.477
Don't scream!

1:14:00.478 --> 1:14:02.062
My ears hurt!

1:14:10.988 --> 1:14:15.867
Wait, wait, are you saying that if Nemo chants the spell, he'll die?

1:14:24.001 --> 1:14:26.920
Oh dear, that is a problem.

1:14:26.921 --> 1:14:28.588
l'm worried.

1:14:28.756 --> 1:14:31.007
l was worried all along.

1:14:32.259 --> 1:14:35.887
lcarus, l'm honored that you're concerned about me.

1:14:36.305 --> 1:14:38.348
But the king needs me.

1:14:38.766 --> 1:14:41.976
l'm sure that the King and the others
are all suffering in Nightmare Castle.

1:14:42.186 --> 1:14:43.603
l need to go save them.

1:14:46.565 --> 1:14:48.399
And l want you to come with me, lcarus.

1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:49.776
l need your help.

1:14:50.319 --> 1:14:51.111
Okay?

1:14:54.323 --> 1:14:55.657
Then it's decided!

1:14:57.576 --> 1:14:59.202
Hurry, to the King!

1:14:59.203 --> 1:15:00.078
Let's go!

1:15:00.079 --> 1:15:01.037
lt's an adventure!

1:15:01.038 --> 1:15:02.539
Ah, me too! me too!

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:05.917
Okay, guys, you'll have to navigate me.

1:15:05.918 --> 1:15:07.544
You can count on us!

1:15:07.545 --> 1:15:09.587
And we're off to Nightmare Castle!

1:15:09.588 --> 1:15:12.048
We're off!

1:15:12.299 --> 1:15:14.384
Goooo!

1:15:15.052 --> 1:15:17.804
To Nightmare Land!

1:16:04.393 --> 1:16:06.477
Here it is! Wind Gate!

1:16:06.478 --> 1:16:08.354
That's the entrance to Nightmare Land!

1:16:16.363 --> 1:16:18.364
So we're finally in Nightmare Land.

1:16:18.616 --> 1:16:21.034
Guys, ready? Keep your guard on Nemo!

1:16:21.035 --> 1:16:22.452
Single-form transformation. . .

1:16:23.412 --> 1:16:24.871
Go!

1:16:35.591 --> 1:16:39.969
Hot! So hot! Someone put me out!

1:16:49.063 --> 1:16:51.356
Watch out!

1:16:58.948 --> 1:17:00.406
What was that thing?

1:17:00.950 --> 1:17:02.742
Nemo! Look forward!

1:17:46.245 --> 1:17:47.829
Look at that!

1:17:47.997 --> 1:17:50.039
lt's Nightmare Castle.

1:18:00.009 --> 1:18:01.843
Guys! Are you ready?

1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:04.095
Hold on tight!

1:18:04.763 --> 1:18:06.306
Here we go!

1:18:25.117 --> 1:18:26.743
Are you all okay?

1:18:26.744 --> 1:18:28.703
Yes, we're okay. . .

1:18:32.124 --> 1:18:37.754
Well then, there's supposed to be a secret
entrance around here somewhere.

1:18:49.308 --> 1:18:52.643
That impudent Nemo and that troublesome scepter,

1:18:52.644 --> 1:18:55.521
We have cleanly disposed of them both, my Lord.

1:18:55.731 --> 1:18:59.400
You will have full control of Slumberland in time.

1:19:00.778 --> 1:19:02.779
All hail Nightmare Land!

1:19:05.657 --> 1:19:06.783
There!

1:19:15.334 --> 1:19:20.922
What? Nemo is in the castle? And he carries the scepter with him?

1:19:21.673 --> 1:19:23.549
You filthy traitor!

1:19:27.346 --> 1:19:30.431
Help! We're getting sucked in!

1:19:35.229 --> 1:19:36.771
Help me!

1:19:43.987 --> 1:19:45.071
What's wrong?

1:19:45.239 --> 1:19:46.739
We're being pulled in.

1:19:47.116 --> 1:19:48.866
How's it happening?

1:19:48.867 --> 1:19:50.201
l don't know!

1:19:50.494 --> 1:19:51.661
Don't let go!

1:20:13.016 --> 1:20:14.434
Where are we?

1:20:15.727 --> 1:20:17.854
lnside Nightmare Castle.

1:20:20.899 --> 1:20:22.108
What was that noise?

1:20:22.484 --> 1:20:23.609
l'm not sure.

1:20:23.819 --> 1:20:25.611
l can't see anything.

1:20:26.613 --> 1:20:28.990
Maybe we should try coming in again after it's light?

1:20:40.419 --> 1:20:41.377
Watch out!

1:20:41.879 --> 1:20:42.920
Let's get out!

1:20:42.921 --> 1:20:44.338
Run and hide!

1:20:47.259 --> 1:20:48.426
Hurry! Hurry!

1:20:48.427 --> 1:20:49.886
lt's coming!

1:20:53.849 --> 1:20:56.142
There's the secret entrance! Hurry!

1:20:56.435 --> 1:20:57.810
lt's that way!

1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:06.277
Ah, that was close.

1:21:06.778 --> 1:21:08.446
lsn't this a great hiding place?

1:21:08.447 --> 1:21:10.031
We built it together.

1:21:10.032 --> 1:21:11.699
Even Nightmare doesn't know about it.

1:21:11.700 --> 1:21:15.661
He can't see us in here, but we can see him.

1:21:17.789 --> 1:21:20.291
Do you seriously think you're well hidden?

1:21:21.877 --> 1:21:24.420
l know exactly where you are.

1:21:24.671 --> 1:21:25.963
l think he sees us.

1:21:25.964 --> 1:21:28.508
Nope. He's trying to trick you.

1:21:29.092 --> 1:21:33.679
Hand over the scepter, Nemo, and l will let you escape.

1:21:34.223 --> 1:21:36.057
Answer me!

1:21:36.892 --> 1:21:40.520
Now, Nemo, my patience wears thin.

1:21:41.063 --> 1:21:44.857
Perhaps this will entice you to change your mind?

1:21:53.617 --> 1:21:56.786
Princess! Professor! Flip!

1:21:57.496 --> 1:22:00.706
Do you like my collection?

1:22:04.711 --> 1:22:06.587
