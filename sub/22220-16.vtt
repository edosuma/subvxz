00:06.382 --> 00:10.375
Crichton:
It's always the same here, Dad.
Nice and quiet.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.379
Zhaan:
Chiana, what is this?

00:11.470 --> 00:12.425
Chiana:
I don't know.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.889
Zhaan:
Look at it, please.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.258
-Well maybe it's your...
-|t's my Bassim Oil.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.304
What? I didn't take it.

00:16.392 --> 00:17.472
I found it in your
chamber, dear.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.516
Well maybe it...
okay, so I took it. Arrest me.

00:19.604 --> 00:21.720
Look Chiana, when we agreed
to let you stay on Moya...

00:21.814 --> 00:23.975
-And if you leave it out again,
I'll take it again!
-you promised to adapt to our ways.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.273
I changed my mind.
You adapt to me.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.019
Chiana!

00:27.111 --> 00:28.351
I've changed my mind!

00:29.864 --> 00:33.698
Yeah, it's always the same
here, Dad. Nice and quiet.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.236
(sighs)

00:39.624 --> 00:41.364
lt's late.

00:41.459 --> 00:45.418
Well, it's space. I don't
really know what time it is.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.995
It's, uh...

00:48.090 --> 00:53.676
I miss the sun, days, nights.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.047
Simple things.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.552
Anyway, I, um...

00:59.644 --> 01:01.680
I wanted to tell you
about this thing.

01:01.771 --> 01:04.433
I'm holding it right now.

01:04.523 --> 01:08.562
It's... it's my first gray hair.

01:11.489 --> 01:12.729
You know, I wouldn't mention it.

01:12.823 --> 01:15.235
It's just that...

01:15.326 --> 01:17.487
I'm afraid I might be
growing old out here.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.489
Pilot:
John Crichton.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.287
You'd better get up here.

01:23.209 --> 01:25.746
I can't deal with this.

01:27.380 --> 01:31.874
(engine slows)

01:31.968 --> 01:33.674
Why have the engines stopped?

01:33.761 --> 01:36.252
Okay, Pilot, I'm here.
What's the problem this time?

01:36.347 --> 01:41.432
Moya hasn't sensed anything
like this since the day
you arrived.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.640
Pilot, how long has that
been there?

01:49.735 --> 01:53.728
ltjust appeared on my scanners,
but it's already breaking apart.

01:53.823 --> 01:55.688
Stability's down to 80%.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.239
What are you up to, Crichton?

01:57.326 --> 01:59.237
Rygel, do you see this?

01:59.328 --> 02:00.317
Do you see this?

02:00.413 --> 02:02.119
Chiana:
What is that?

02:02.206 --> 02:05.243
Rygel:
That is a pathetic little waste
funnel of which I care little about.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.746
We're supposed to be on our way
to the commerce planet,

02:07.837 --> 02:10.169
where I believe they have
Hynerian marjols.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.042
Is he the captain?

02:12.133 --> 02:14.374
Because if he's not the captain,
then how does he get to
stop the ship?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.333
That is a wormhole.

02:16.429 --> 02:19.262
Rygel:
Yeah, yeah, now restart the
engines, if you please.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.054
What if I wanted to
stop the ship?

02:21.142 --> 02:24.305
Crichton, look at this.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.139
Oh my God.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.562
Rygel:
What? It's just a
tiny blue planet.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.560
What are you getting so
worked up about?

02:30.651 --> 02:33.108
Oh, it's got no particle
rings, no red moons.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.527
Chiana:
Totally unimpressive.

02:38.034 --> 02:39.399
That's Earth.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.915
That's my home.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.132
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

02:57.219 --> 03:00.347
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:00.431 --> 03:03.218
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

03:03.309 --> 03:06.597
A living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

03:06.687 --> 03:07.472
Help me...

03:07.563 --> 03:09.178
Listen, please.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.264
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:11.359 --> 03:15.102
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

03:15.196 --> 03:17.403
...doing everything I can...

03:17.490 --> 03:19.856
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:46.602 --> 03:47.842
You're going now?

03:47.937 --> 03:51.304
Yeah. Pilot says we're
running out of time.

03:52.942 --> 03:55.979
I can't go with you.

03:56.070 --> 03:59.278
Aeryn, this could be
our only chance.

03:59.365 --> 04:01.447
No, this is your only chance.

04:01.534 --> 04:03.866
I'm not certain l'll
belong there.

04:03.953 --> 04:06.911
You would. You will. I promise.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.409
I'm sorry.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.743
Crichton, wormhole stability
down to 57%.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.122
I'm on my way.

04:19.969 --> 04:22.176
That wormhole could blast
you out anywhere.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.218
I know.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.886
Pilot says it's unsafe
and it could...

04:24.974 --> 04:26.259
It could kill me, Zhaan.
I know.

04:26.350 --> 04:29.308
You've given me every good
reason not to go.

04:29.395 --> 04:33.263
I could end up dead,
I could end up more lost
than I already am.

04:33.357 --> 04:37.316
You've given me every single
thing except one.

04:37.403 --> 04:38.267
What?

04:38.362 --> 04:39.442
This could be Earth.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.486
This is the way I got here,
through a wormhole.

04:41.574 --> 04:43.030
It could be my way home.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.153
I've got to do this, Zhaan.

04:47.246 --> 04:51.956
Look, however this works out,
this could be goodbye.

04:52.042 --> 04:59.210
And I know that you, ah,
didn't expect me to be here,
but thanks.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.382
You saved my life.

05:02.428 --> 05:03.292
All of you.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.342
Pilot:
Crichton.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.591
Stability down to 48%.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.638
Yeah, I'm going, Pilot.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.852
Goodbye, big guy.

05:21.947 --> 05:26.316
I, ah, hope you get your
chance one day.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.406
You go see your son.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.200
I hope so too.

05:36.629 --> 05:40.247
Goodbye, John.

05:46.597 --> 05:54.185
John Crichton, remember, there's
a part of me inside you.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.648
Take care of it.

05:57.942 --> 05:59.682
|Wi||.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.020
Sparky.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.070
What?

06:06.158 --> 06:07.694
I'm not taking my stuff.

06:07.785 --> 06:09.321
Mmm?

06:09.411 --> 06:11.117
So I thought I'd give it
to somebody.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.786
Hmm.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.158
To Aeryn.

06:14.250 --> 06:14.909
No!

06:15.000 --> 06:16.410
No, you can't do that...

06:17.836 --> 06:21.203
(Rygel laughing)

06:27.388 --> 06:28.343
Goodbye.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.654
Pilot:
39% stability.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.827
I'm doing this as fast
as I can, Pilot.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.203
Pilot:
You're almost at entry vector.

06:59.295 --> 07:01.331
Just a little more.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.261
Now! Go now, Crichton.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.430
Entry angle confirmed.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.427
Go!

07:14.518 --> 07:15.598
What's the matter with him?

07:15.686 --> 07:20.350
Rygel:
Just go, you lucky prabakto. Go.

07:21.025 --> 07:22.014
Crichton.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.064
Yeah, D'Argo?

07:23.152 --> 07:24.892
I understand the fear.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.148
If you don't do this now,
you will regret it forever.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.322
You must go now.

07:31.327 --> 07:33.158
Do it, John.

07:34.330 --> 07:35.991
Thirty-four percent.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.793
Crichton:
Thanks, big guy.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.460
Okay.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.585
Give me some luck.

08:06.779 --> 08:09.316
John, can you hear me?

08:09.406 --> 08:11.658
Pilot, are you reading
anything from him?

08:11.742 --> 08:14.404
He's off my sensors.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.201
He's gone.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.627
Pilot, are you tracking me?

08:29.718 --> 08:30.707
Pilot?

08:44.358 --> 08:47.225
(loud beeping)

08:47.319 --> 08:50.186
( loud roar)

09:31.363 --> 09:34.275
(laughing)

09:36.493 --> 09:41.362
Hello, sky!

09:53.802 --> 09:56.179
Excuse me.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.757
Miss, I know this is this is
going to sound insane,

10:00.851 --> 10:05.265
but this is Australia, right?

10:08.066 --> 10:09.442
What?

10:15.491 --> 10:16.947
Hey!

10:17.034 --> 10:19.195
Guys, where you been?

10:28.253 --> 10:29.538
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:29.630 --> 10:31.336
Wait. I'm John Crichton.

10:31.423 --> 10:32.924
(gunshot)

10:44.478 --> 10:49.438
(panting)

11:26.520 --> 11:28.351
Man:
Let's go again.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.401
So why did you land in
Australia?

11:36.822 --> 11:38.403
ldidn't land.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.991
l crashed.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.904
And what is your mission here?

11:46.999 --> 11:48.580
What are you talking about?

11:48.667 --> 11:51.204
I don't have a mission.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.791
Have you been here before?

11:58.886 --> 12:02.253
l'm John Crichton.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.929
You know that, Wilson.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.679
What? You-you-you think
I'm an alien?

12:07.769 --> 12:10.260
( chuckles )

12:10.355 --> 12:12.220
Have you been here before?

12:16.945 --> 12:19.652
Australia?

12:19.740 --> 12:21.526
Yeah. Three times.

12:21.617 --> 12:27.203
You were here with me last year
when I tested the Farscape's
engines, Wilson.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.530
So what the hell is going on?!

12:31.251 --> 12:38.419
(speaking african dialect)

12:40.093 --> 12:42.254
This is the 12th guy, Wilson.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.302
How many more are you going to
roll in here before you believe

12:44.389 --> 12:49.349
these are translator microbes
in my head and not some
space virus?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.301
What did he say?

12:51.396 --> 12:56.356
Well, I think he said that...

12:56.443 --> 13:01.437
until he gets some answers he's
not going to play anymore.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.088
Hey, Cobb, when am |
getting out of here?

13:20.175 --> 13:22.382
I don't know.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.797
You don't know.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.220
Can I get a newspaper?

13:30.435 --> 13:33.973
Oh, come on, Cobb!

13:34.064 --> 13:36.100
What am I going to find out?

13:36.191 --> 13:37.806
I mean...

13:37.901 --> 13:39.641
Look, I've been away for, what
would you say, seven months?

13:39.736 --> 13:43.069
| just want to know what's
happened, something since
I've been gone.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.533
Who won the Super Bowl, Cobb?

13:49.037 --> 13:51.244
I don't know.

13:51.331 --> 13:56.371
I know you're Australian, Cobb,
but you've got to know who won
the Super Bowl.

13:57.462 --> 14:01.296
You know who Ty Cobb is, Cobb?

14:01.383 --> 14:03.089
No? How about Babe Ruth?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.507
You know who Babe Ruth is?

14:04.594 --> 14:07.301
Some fat guy that played
for the Yankees.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.471
Good. Fat guy.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.685
You're kidding me.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.637
This is how he described them?

14:17.733 --> 14:20.315
Guard:
I'm sorry, sir, there's
no access. Stop, sir.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.233
-Out of my way.
-This is a restricted area, sir.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.355
Back off, soldier.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.311
Kill that switch.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.737
Crichton:
Dad!

14:26.575 --> 14:28.111
I've waited two days.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.987
I want to see him.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.409
I want to see my son now.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.282
Jack, that's what we're
trying to determine.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.328
Whether it is your son.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.781
What have you done to him?

14:35.876 --> 14:38.834
He's got foreign microbes
in his brain stem,

14:38.920 --> 14:42.754
and the Farscape module has
been modified by non-human
technology.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.674
You know how this works,
Colonel.

14:45.761 --> 14:49.299
Once we've confirmed John poses
no threat, then you can see him.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.926
I don't buy that.
I want to see him now.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.436
Dad.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.365
Get me out of here, please.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.943
I need to ask you some
questions.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.380
What happened on your
tenth birthday?

15:34.810 --> 15:36.846
What?

15:37.979 --> 15:39.935
Tenth birthday?

15:41.566 --> 15:43.397
I don't know.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.397
I can't remember.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.444
We were living in Annapolis.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.648
Annapolis.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.821
Right.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.327
You were late.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.871
Again.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.331
Why?

16:03.421 --> 16:05.673
You said...

16:08.343 --> 16:10.584
you said they held you in
Houston for tests.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.089
You missed your flight.

16:12.180 --> 16:15.343
But you commandeered a jet
and you came anyway.

16:18.395 --> 16:21.853
I woke you up at four o'clock
in the morning.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.805
You took me fishing.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.026
At Sawyer's Mill.

16:29.114 --> 16:32.823
And you caught the biggest
damn bass I'd ever seen.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.619
It was a trout, Dad.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.126
Yeah, it was a trout.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.254
I missed you, son.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.505
Crichton:
What's going on?

16:56.600 --> 16:58.966
I know recovery procedure
as well as anyone.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.596
This is way beyond routine.

17:00.687 --> 17:05.272
Nothing's been routine since the
day you left seven months ago.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.350
That wormhole you went through
is still there.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.478
You opened a door, son.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.612
A door to Earth we don't know
how to close.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.240
(whispers ):
Get me out of here.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.329
Jack:
Believe I will.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.498
Crichton:
ldon't buy this, Dad.

17:31.593 --> 17:32.423
Jack:
What?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.592
Wilson, letting me out.

17:34.679 --> 17:38.422
There's no way he'd let me out
of his sight if what you
say is true.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.380
You know Wilson?

17:39.476 --> 17:41.762
Yeah. Know Cobb, too.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.558
He hasn't let you out
of his sight, son.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.898
See that van in the parking lot?

17:52.280 --> 17:54.316
Those two women to our right?

17:54.407 --> 17:57.695
The one in the red with the
headphones, you know, sunning
herself on the rocks?

17:57.786 --> 17:58.650
Yeah, yeah, I see them.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.781
They're watching us.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.456
They like to get real close.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.411
( radio static )

18:26.481 --> 18:29.723
Listen. A global alliance has
been set up to track
the wormhole.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.275
Ray Wilson's been put in charge
by the Pentagon.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.853
What the hell does he
want from me?

18:34.948 --> 18:39.112
He wants you to relax so that I
can tell whether or not you're
really my son.

18:39.202 --> 18:41.443
Then he wants to know everything
you know about the wormhole

18:41.538 --> 18:43.403
and everything you saw on
the other side.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.704
Oh, give me a break, Dad.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.702
I'll tell him everything.
You know that.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.205
I know that.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.254
I kept that safe for you.

18:57.345 --> 19:01.429
Don't know if it brought me
luck, but it saved my ass.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.307
You know, when you disappeared
in Farscape One, I...

19:08.398 --> 19:12.858
had to deal with the
possibility that you might
not be alive.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.185
Well, now you know.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.239
Now you know how I felt as
a kid every time you went
on a mission.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.199
Come on, son.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.498
We've got a lot of work to do.

19:34.966 --> 19:40.256
( Crichton chewing ):
They have worlds out there,
people out there that you wouldn't believe.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.303
But they do not have chocolate.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.255
Hang on a second.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.600
Hey, no. Don't do it like that.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.474
It's a propulsion fin.
It's part of the
hetch drive, okay?

19:50.565 --> 19:52.066
Yes, sir.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.066
Deja vu.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.363
Have we met?

20:00.450 --> 20:02.657
Yes, sir. Last year in the
Simpson Desert,

20:02.744 --> 20:04.735
when you were down there
for the shuttle tests.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.160
You were with Cobb, right?

20:06.247 --> 20:07.498
Yes, sir.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.744
Right.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.790
Well, it's, um...

20:11.878 --> 20:14.119
it's good to see you again.

20:22.097 --> 20:22.802
Sir!

20:22.889 --> 20:24.004
What's going on?

20:24.099 --> 20:25.464
Cobb:
Strat Comm from Sector
Three, sir.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.173
Something else has come
through the wormhole.

20:27.268 --> 20:31.136
Bring him!
What do we got?

20:31.231 --> 20:33.313
There's an unidentified ship
tracking in on the
same trajectory

20:33.400 --> 20:34.731
as the Farscape module.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.149
F-16s are scrambling
for a visual.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.191
Are they here for you?

20:37.278 --> 20:38.734
-What?
-Are they here to save you?

20:38.822 --> 20:40.608
-I don't...
-Who is it?!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.068
Who is that?!

20:43.159 --> 20:44.239
Look, I can't see...

20:44.327 --> 20:45.112
Who is it?!

20:45.203 --> 20:46.989
Who's on first!
What's on second!

20:47.080 --> 20:48.911
I don't know!
I can't see them!

20:48.998 --> 20:50.329
F-16s locked and ready.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.783
Crichton:
Wait! That's Moya's
Transport Pod.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.083
Tell them not to fire.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.706
Are they here to attack us?

20:55.797 --> 20:58.163
No, they're not here to harm us,
Wilson. Just tell them
not to fire.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.964
That's not my call, Crichton.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.211
Tell them, Wilson!

21:01.302 --> 21:04.260
They don't have any weapons
on board the transport!

21:04.347 --> 21:06.713
Tell them not to fire!

21:11.396 --> 21:13.387
Tell them not to fire.

21:40.008 --> 21:44.798
After you left, your Earth
disappeared through the
wormhole.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.674
It was her idea to see what
was going on...

21:46.764 --> 21:47.970
Wilson:
What are they saying, Crichton?

21:48.057 --> 21:52.141
( Rygel speaking Hynerian )

21:52.228 --> 21:58.770
(Aeryn speaking Sebacean )

21:58.860 --> 22:01.021
There was nothing I could do.

22:01.112 --> 22:03.068
(low grumbling)

22:03.156 --> 22:05.488
Crichton:
Rygel, you okay?

22:05.575 --> 22:08.863
No. I'm frelling sick.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.236
What are they saying?

22:11.331 --> 22:14.073
They're scared, Wilson.
That's what they're saying.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.533
I'm not scared. I'm sick.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.118
What the yotz did you give me?

22:18.213 --> 22:20.329
(hissing)

22:20.423 --> 22:23.256
Jack:
Son, are you okay in there?

22:23.343 --> 22:24.207
I'm fine.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.634
( D'Argo growling )

22:28.473 --> 22:31.260
It's the tranquilizer, Rygel.
That's what's making you sick.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.807
lt'll wear off soon.
You're going to be okay.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.680
( Rygel speaking )

22:34.771 --> 22:36.511
Crichton:
They're freaking out.

22:36.606 --> 22:40.940
You're an alien and they're
freaking out.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.280
l vowed I would never be
taken prisoner again.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.028
You're not a prisoner.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.109
Trust me.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.035
I'm going to take care
of you guys.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.364
Rygel:
Crichton, | feel
frelling terrible.

22:56.459 --> 22:59.326
Yeah. I'm going to get someone
in here for you, Rygel.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.454
( knocks )

23:03.550 --> 23:05.415
(door opening)

23:17.522 --> 23:20.480
What's going on?
What's taking so long?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.182
-Relax, son.
-And do what, Dad?

23:22.277 --> 23:24.268
Read a magazine? They're all
seven months old, Dad.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.648
They don't want me to have
any idea what's going on.

23:26.739 --> 23:32.359
If what you say about those
aliens is true, they can help
us unlock the universe.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.660
You're positive they're not
here to harm us?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.487
No.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.495
They came looking for me.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.998
They were worried.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.747
You trust them?

23:45.842 --> 23:48.379
A lot more than I trust Wilson.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.928
I like 'em, Dad.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.052
They're my friends.

23:55.143 --> 23:58.385
Sir, we need you in the
medical unit.

23:58.479 --> 23:59.639
What's the matter?

23:59.731 --> 24:01.346
I think you should see this.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.064
Wilson!

24:42.148 --> 24:44.309
We spent our lives waiting
for this moment.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.858
We sent Voyager. We left damn
greeting cards on the moon

24:47.945 --> 24:51.108
and as soon as | get here,
look at what you're doing.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.564
They can help us.

24:53.660 --> 24:57.244
Just take a step back and you
look at what you're doing.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.663
You think about it.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.207
Don't worry. I've thought of
everything, Commander.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.883
You make me sick!

25:11.969 --> 25:17.805
Official word is Rygel died
from an allergic reaction
to the tranquilizer.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.348
What do you think happened?

25:19.435 --> 25:22.302
It doesn't matter what
I think, D'Argo.

25:27.235 --> 25:29.226
No, I think they killed him.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.312
You know that those animals
killed him.

25:32.407 --> 25:33.613
Then they cut him open.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.691
They said they were just trying
to restart his heart.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.697
They were studying him
like an animal.

25:38.788 --> 25:41.200
Like an alien.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.622
Which one of us do you think
they'll kill next, Crichton?

25:43.710 --> 25:47.578
D'Argo, it's not going to
go down like that.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.708
Look, I know that you have
no reason to trust me...

25:49.799 --> 25:52.165
You're right!
I don't trust you.

25:53.845 --> 25:59.590
But you tell those humans that
when they come for me,
I'll kill them.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.929
D'Argo, don't...

26:02.019 --> 26:05.762
We've tried it your way and
one of us is dead.

26:07.108 --> 26:08.348
Go.

26:20.455 --> 26:23.947
Aeryn?

26:24.041 --> 26:31.709
You know, Crichton,
Peacekeepers wouldn't even kill
their prisoners to study them.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.542
D'Argo's right.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.424
Just go.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.315
Let me out of here.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.826
Son.

27:06.918 --> 27:10.160
I gave them my word, Dad.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.631
I told them I'd take
care of them.

27:12.715 --> 27:16.253
You were naive to think you
could protect them from
people like Wilson.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.297
I need a favor, Dad.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.093
Name it.

27:24.185 --> 27:27.473
I want you to call in every
markerthat you have.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.771
Every General, every
Undersecretary, every
Pentagon mistress.

27:30.858 --> 27:35.101
You tell them what's going on
here and you get them
to stop it.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.652
What are you going to do, son?

27:36.739 --> 27:38.275
I'm just going to plead
with Wilson.

27:38.366 --> 27:41.153
I'm going to beg for
their lives.

27:41.244 --> 27:43.485
No, no. I know that look, John.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.285
You be careful.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.284
I'm just going to make him
understand, Dad.

27:47.375 --> 27:50.583
Son, are you willing to die for
those creatures in there?

27:53.631 --> 27:55.792
I gave my word.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.261
Did I kill him?

28:44.974 --> 28:46.589
No.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.848
Are you with me?

28:52.398 --> 28:54.309
Orthem?

28:54.400 --> 28:55.480
I'm with you.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.399
Aeryn.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.394
Trust me.

29:01.324 --> 29:03.360
Put down the gun.

29:13.002 --> 29:14.367
They know you're out?

29:15.338 --> 29:16.874
They took D'Argo somewhere.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.797
When the guard came back for me
l was ready for him.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.210
Where'd they take him?

29:24.305 --> 29:27.342
I don't know, but I'm not
waiting for them to come back.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.304
All right then. Let's move.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.611
Hey, Cobb.

29:43.908 --> 29:47.492
You find out who won the
Super Bowl yet?

29:48.829 --> 29:51.115
What do you want, Crichton?

30:00.758 --> 30:04.467
(Aeryn speaks in Sebacean )

30:04.553 --> 30:06.714
What is she doing here?

30:07.515 --> 30:11.133
(Aeryn speaks in Sebacean )

30:11.227 --> 30:12.842
What did she say?

30:12.937 --> 30:16.270
She says she wants to
shoot you, Cobb.

30:16.357 --> 30:18.313
I don't know if it's a
good idea or not,

30:18.401 --> 30:21.985
but I figure since you've
pushed us this far it doesn't
really matter, does it?

30:24.699 --> 30:26.280
Where's D'Argo?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.742
They flew him to another base.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.370
He's gone, Crichton.
You can't save him.

30:41.257 --> 30:44.590
If you'd only been reasonable.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.885
You're wrong in what you're
doing here, Cobb.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.345
You're wrong.

30:51.559 --> 30:54.346
You're not going to
shoot me, are you?

31:02.319 --> 31:04.105
You're wrong.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.655
That's for Rygel.

31:13.122 --> 31:15.829
Aeryn, pick it up. I want to
get out of this rain.

31:17.418 --> 31:19.704
This is the place.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.960
Rain.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.538
Is that what you call this?

31:24.633 --> 31:26.169
I like it.

31:26.260 --> 31:28.046
Aeryn!

31:33.851 --> 31:35.807
Why this place?

31:37.688 --> 31:39.770
My Dad and I stayed here
last year.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.848
He said we could use it
as a safe house.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.069
Your father told you about
this place?

31:44.153 --> 31:44.983
Yeah.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.231
Crichton, he is with them.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.903
This is the first place they
will look for us.

31:47.990 --> 31:49.651
ldon't think so.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.357
I trust him.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.367
Ladies first.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.629
(distant thunder)

32:15.309 --> 32:17.345
(thunder continues)

32:22.233 --> 32:23.393
So what's this?

32:23.484 --> 32:25.065
It's beer.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.268
Alcohol.

32:27.363 --> 32:29.649
Trust me, it'sjust what
we need right now.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.690
Down the hatch.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.694
Down the hatch.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.533
You like it?

32:43.212 --> 32:44.622
Yes.

32:47.675 --> 32:49.711
It's like Fellip nectar.

32:49.802 --> 32:53.260
A Fellip's a creature on Tarsis
and they get the nectar from...

32:53.347 --> 32:54.962
Aeryn, please.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.093
Don't tell me where it
comes from.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.425
Just drink the beer.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.021
Sorry.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.767
What for?

33:07.862 --> 33:09.727
Everything.

33:10.531 --> 33:13.523
What's happened here,

33:13.617 --> 33:15.733
getting you stuck on Moya.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.944
I mean, if it wasn't for me,
you'd still be the

33:18.038 --> 33:21.826
happy little Peacekeeper
dominating the lesser races.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.751
Hmm.

33:25.838 --> 33:28.500
I've got a lot to blame you
for, Crichton.

33:30.301 --> 33:31.791
Look at that.

33:31.886 --> 33:32.966
What?

33:33.053 --> 33:34.918
That's it.

33:36.307 --> 33:37.342
Earth.

33:37.433 --> 33:40.470
(distant siren wailing)

33:40.561 --> 33:43.598
Minus the sunshine.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.977
You know, you were right.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.228
It's actually very beautiful.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.652
(thunder rumbling)

34:00.873 --> 34:07.164
Were you scared to join me,
when I left Moya?

34:13.385 --> 34:15.216
Yes.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.506
I won't be recaptured,
Crichton.

34:20.601 --> 34:24.344
They will have to kill me if
they come to take me tomorrow.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.771
I know.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.118
(birds chirping)

35:22.997 --> 35:26.865
(John moaning)

35:29.044 --> 35:30.375
Get out of bed, John.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.204
Ohhhh...

35:33.299 --> 35:35.085
Morning.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.302
Come on. I've worked out that
plan we talked about.

35:40.389 --> 35:45.304
Aeryn, um, about last night.

35:45.394 --> 35:49.137
Yes, it's fine John. It's just
not top priority right now.

35:49.231 --> 35:53.144
I've gone through all of these
pictures and I've found
a few places

35:53.235 --> 35:56.068
that seem to be uninhabited
enough to hide in.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.065
You're right.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.197
We, um, we have to find
a place to hide.

36:04.288 --> 36:05.323
Let's go.

36:05.414 --> 36:09.657
No, you're not going anywhere
dressed like that.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.345
You sure about this?

36:24.433 --> 36:26.264
You look fine. We got...

36:26.352 --> 36:27.842
( knocking at door)

36:30.731 --> 36:32.141
It's my father.

36:32.232 --> 36:34.359
I knew it. He's betrayed us.
There'll be soldiers outside.

36:34.443 --> 36:35.432
No, he won't. I trust him.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.687
Idont

36:44.161 --> 36:45.196
Are you okay, son?

36:45.287 --> 36:46.151
Yeah.

36:46.246 --> 36:48.077
Remember Aeryn Sun?

36:49.333 --> 36:50.288
We actually never met.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.331
Hak nyatse.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.203
What's she saying?

36:52.294 --> 36:53.204
He doesn't have a gun.

36:53.295 --> 36:54.159
Hak nyatse!

36:54.254 --> 36:55.630
I'm not going to search him.

36:57.758 --> 36:59.498
Is she ever going to
put that down?

37:01.387 --> 37:03.252
I don't think so.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.796
What are you doing here?

37:05.891 --> 37:07.301
Does Wilson know you're here?

37:07.393 --> 37:09.224
No.

37:09.311 --> 37:12.929
It's not going to take them
long to start searching places
we've been before.

37:13.023 --> 37:15.139
Did you talk to anybody for us?

37:15.234 --> 37:17.350
Everybody.

37:17.444 --> 37:21.028
No one's going to help us, son.
It's too dangerous.

37:21.115 --> 37:22.104
And what about you?

37:22.199 --> 37:23.234
I don't matter in this.

37:23.325 --> 37:25.691
Official word is that these
aliens never existed.

37:25.786 --> 37:29.324
D'Argo's on his way to a
military base in Utah and the
warehouse has been swept clean.

37:29.415 --> 37:30.200
(Aeryn speaks in Sebacean )

37:30.290 --> 37:31.325
Aeryn!

37:31.417 --> 37:32.657
Back off.

37:33.210 --> 37:34.541
Please.

37:38.298 --> 37:39.162
Listen.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.044
The two of you have to get
out of town.

37:41.135 --> 37:43.296
You've got to find someplace
that's safe.

37:44.805 --> 37:46.420
I'll hold them off here
as long as I can.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.881
No. No, I don't want you
to cover for me.

37:48.976 --> 37:51.433
This is the only play, son.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.135
You're in this too deep.

37:53.230 --> 37:55.687
They're not going to let you
just walk away.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.276
Look.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.147
At least this time I get
to say goodbye.

38:04.366 --> 38:07.153
Oh well, um...

38:07.244 --> 38:09.906
we'll hole up somewhere,
and I'll, uh, contact you.

38:09.997 --> 38:10.952
No.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.291
If I know anything,

38:14.334 --> 38:15.870
they'll try to make me tell 'em.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.251
You just go.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.882
Goodbye, Dad.

38:42.321 --> 38:49.989
(Aeryn speaks in Sebacean )

38:55.250 --> 38:57.866
Thank you, Aeryn Sun.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.304
Why is everyone looking at me?

39:18.398 --> 39:20.138
That's 'cause they think you
look good.

39:23.612 --> 39:24.897
Aeryn:
What?

39:24.988 --> 39:27.604
That girl. She was on the beach
the other day,

39:27.699 --> 39:29.280
when I crash landed. That one.

39:29.993 --> 39:30.948
So?

39:31.036 --> 39:33.402
I think I know her. I think...

39:33.497 --> 39:36.284
we went to high school
together. It was only for
a couple of weeks.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.115
We never talked, but...

39:38.210 --> 39:40.417
Yeah, yeah. She looks familiar.

39:40.504 --> 39:42.836
( chuckles )

39:46.301 --> 39:47.757
Hey, can I help you, mate?

39:51.306 --> 39:53.342
They're all seven months old.

39:53.433 --> 39:56.425
Why are they all seven
months old?

39:57.896 --> 39:59.602
John, stop it.

39:59.690 --> 40:00.975
I've seen all these before.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.567
They're from when I left!

40:02.651 --> 40:04.266
What are you doing, John?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.274
I know you, don't I?

40:08.365 --> 40:09.229
What?

40:09.324 --> 40:10.279
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

40:10.367 --> 40:12.699
You're the guy on the
beach the other day!

40:12.786 --> 40:14.242
Shh! Just keep your voice down.

40:14.329 --> 40:19.369
I used to ride my bike past
your house in the fifth grade.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.165
I don't know what you're
talking about. I've never seen
you before in my life.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.335
Everybody here, Aeryn.
I know them all.

40:23.422 --> 40:26.960
I know Wilson, I know Cobb,
I know you!

40:27.050 --> 40:29.257
John, stop it. Keep your voice
down. What are you doing?

40:29.344 --> 40:31.335
I know everyone!

40:31.430 --> 40:34.046
Get away from me, Aeryn.
Get away!

40:34.141 --> 40:35.221
Back off!

40:35.309 --> 40:39.222
Every place I've been,
I've been there before.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.520
Every place.

40:44.318 --> 40:47.401
Frank Cokonis! I dated
your sister!

40:55.662 --> 40:58.119
Yeah! Here we go!

40:58.206 --> 40:59.707
Ha-ha!

41:00.834 --> 41:03.291
This is exactly the way
I remember it.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.755
I know all you guys, don't I?

41:08.592 --> 41:10.799
It's a little out of context.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.546
But I know you.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.639
How the hell you been?

41:26.401 --> 41:28.437
Quit.

41:30.030 --> 41:32.897
Now what the hell are
you doing here?

41:36.286 --> 41:38.447
Yeah, I've been here.

41:40.457 --> 41:42.072
Been in there.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.293
Nothing new.

41:55.889 --> 41:58.471
But I've never been in there.

42:19.955 --> 42:21.240
Make me.

42:21.331 --> 42:23.117
You're not going to shoot.
You're not even Wilson.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.163
Where's the female alien?

42:24.251 --> 42:25.832
I'm going to talk to the
man in charge

42:25.919 --> 42:27.830
and we both know it ain't you.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.636
Who are you?

42:44.354 --> 42:46.094
You did well, John.

42:46.189 --> 42:49.056
Most species don't do as well.

42:49.151 --> 42:52.018
What is all this?

42:52.112 --> 42:56.276
Everything here is a physical
creation from your memory.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.490
But you're not real.

42:59.578 --> 43:01.318
Well...

43:03.290 --> 43:05.406
I'm not your father.

43:06.460 --> 43:08.291
And what about my friends?

43:08.378 --> 43:09.208
They're real.

43:09.296 --> 43:11.161
Living matter.

43:11.256 --> 43:14.589
They were investigating the
wormhole we'd created from
your memory.

43:14.676 --> 43:17.042
So we decided to use them
in our trial.

43:17.137 --> 43:19.594
D'Argo:
Crichton.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.137
Enough is enough.

43:21.224 --> 43:22.555
D'Argo!

43:22.642 --> 43:24.018
Get us back home.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.343
Ry... Rygel.

43:27.439 --> 43:28.349
They didn't kill you.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.190
Rygel:
Kill me?

43:29.274 --> 43:30.684
( laughs )

43:30.776 --> 43:33.358
These people treated me
splendidly.

43:33.445 --> 43:35.276
They gave me marjols, Crichton.

43:35.363 --> 43:37.649
Lovely Hynerian marjols.

43:37.741 --> 43:39.948
Mmm...

43:40.660 --> 43:42.116
(munching)

43:42.204 --> 43:45.162
Whoever you are, I thank you!

43:45.248 --> 43:46.988
Of course we didn't kill him.

43:47.083 --> 43:49.074
We created his corpse.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.576
Why?

43:51.671 --> 43:55.505
Why would you make me think
that he was dead?

43:55.592 --> 43:59.255
We needed a human reaction,
John.

43:59.346 --> 44:00.381
Your reaction.

44:00.472 --> 44:03.430
You made me think you
were my father!

44:10.440 --> 44:12.351
I'm sorry.

44:12.442 --> 44:15.400
For the trial to have value you
had to believe everything.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.236
Let me show you.

44:22.244 --> 44:25.156
Are we anywhere near Earth?

44:25.247 --> 44:27.738
Actually, we're not far
from Moya.

44:29.334 --> 44:34.954
We brought you here to
recreate your memory.

44:35.048 --> 44:37.960
But if you can make all this,

44:38.051 --> 44:41.384
why not just make a wormhole
to take you to Earth?

44:41.471 --> 44:44.178
That would use all our
remaining power.

44:44.266 --> 44:49.260
We only have enough left to
transport our race
one last time.

44:49.354 --> 44:52.187
We had to be certain of how
we'd be received.

45:31.771 --> 45:34.558
Though space is without
boundanes

45:34.649 --> 45:37.812
there are but a few planets
where we can live.

45:38.987 --> 45:41.444
So you're looking to take over
someone else's?

45:41.531 --> 45:43.317
Not take over.

45:43.408 --> 45:45.273
Cohabitate.

45:45.368 --> 45:47.529
To replenish our hive.

45:50.248 --> 45:55.208
The ancients have stories of a
world that will welcome us.

45:55.295 --> 45:57.536
We can only hope they're true.

45:59.174 --> 46:01.165
You can move closer.

46:01.259 --> 46:02.669
Thanks.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.297
I'm close enough.

46:04.387 --> 46:08.255
We had to find out whether
humans would welcome us
or fight us.

46:29.162 --> 46:31.118
You stole my memories.

46:31.206 --> 46:34.619
I'm sorry to have taken
this form,

46:34.709 --> 46:38.042
but I thought the best spy
would be a father,

46:38.129 --> 46:41.087
as seen through his son's eyes.

46:43.301 --> 46:45.508
You stole my memories.

46:45.595 --> 46:48.086
We had no choice.

46:52.018 --> 46:55.886
Show me what you really
look like.

47:34.227 --> 47:38.311
Many of us hoped that Earth
might be our welcoming place.

47:38.398 --> 47:41.731
If all people were like you,
maybe it could be.

47:41.818 --> 47:43.854
But they're not.

47:43.945 --> 47:47.403
In your memory, we saw millions
of Wilsons and Cobbs.

47:47.490 --> 47:50.072
It also led us to a familiar
conclusion.

47:50.160 --> 47:51.821
Which was?

47:51.911 --> 47:55.369
That the highest life form on
the planet is also the most
destructive.

47:56.082 --> 47:58.323
Your humans would kill us.

48:06.843 --> 48:08.754
So, what will you do now?

48:08.845 --> 48:12.053
What we've done since before
I was hatched.

48:12.140 --> 48:14.847
We continue searching
for a home.

48:16.102 --> 48:18.388
So Will I.

48:22.150 --> 48:23.515
Here.

48:40.502 --> 48:42.083
Thanks.

48:55.683 --> 48:58.550
Maybe we'll meet again
one day, John.

49:02.816 --> 49:04.397
Maybe.
