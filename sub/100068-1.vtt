WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:03.307
I'll see you at the lake.

00:07.224 --> 00:10.967
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.449
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.492 --> 00:17.017
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:21.151 --> 00:24.198
DEE:
Hey, look what I just found,
at the bus stop.

00:24.241 --> 00:27.766
"Gruesome twosome seek exotic
Europeans for weeklong rental

00:27.810 --> 00:30.160
"in luxurious
one-bedroom apartment.

00:30.204 --> 00:33.163
"Bed to be shared with owners.
Shitter down hall.

00:33.207 --> 00:37.080
Email F. Reynolds
at Warthog-OrgyFart.edu."

00:37.124 --> 00:39.430
-FRANK: Nice.
-Wha-- what?-CHARLIE: Yeah. It's a good ad.

00:39.474 --> 00:42.129
You know, we got the Airbnb idea
from Dennis and Mac,

00:42.172 --> 00:44.522
-'cause they're doing it.
-Yes, but we're not posting
creepy flyers at bus stations.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.350
I mean, w-what kind
of people do you think

00:46.394 --> 00:48.135
-you're gonna attract with that?-FRANK: What?

00:48.178 --> 00:50.485
Young Bohemians
with no sexual boundaries,

00:50.528 --> 00:52.965
w-who don't mind a shitter
down the hall.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.358
CHARLIE:
Yeah, like,
European backpacking chicks

00:54.402 --> 00:56.447
-who stay in hostels and stuff.-Yeah. Free.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.536
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah. Don't be jealous
when Charlie and I

00:58.580 --> 01:02.018
are up to our eyebrows
in Viennese gash.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.150
-Ugh.
-Ugh, gross.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.715
Come on, man.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.370
Guys, don't try to lump
yourselves in

01:06.414 --> 01:08.155
with what we're doing, okay?
What we're doing

01:08.198 --> 01:10.113
is very charming and romantic.

01:10.157 --> 01:13.029
-We're setting up a meet-cute.
-Ah, a-a w-what?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.162
Are you trying to say,
uh, "meat cube"?

01:15.205 --> 01:17.120
-Like, a little cube of meat?
-Meat?

01:17.164 --> 01:19.514
-Because that's a good idea,
actually.
-MAC: No.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.993
We're doing a meet-cute.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.126
It's-it's where
two soul mates meet

01:23.170 --> 01:26.216
under charming
and/or cute circumstances.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.000
-Like, from a rom-com.
-DENNIS: No.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.524
-Let-let's keep the trap simple.-Yeah.

01:29.567 --> 01:32.353
Well, don't call it a trap,
because that's not romantic.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.442
Yeah, I'm sure for Dennis,
it's a trap.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.557
-MAC: Coming.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.429
You must be Lisa.

02:05.473 --> 02:06.952
-And you must be Mac.
-That's right.

02:06.996 --> 02:10.217
Come on in
to my very spacious apartment.

02:10.259 --> 02:11.783
This is gonna be your room here,

02:11.827 --> 02:13.437
-and I think that...
-DENNIS: Hello. Oh...

02:13.481 --> 02:15.961
Hello, I'm Dennis.
I'm here for the room.

02:16.005 --> 02:18.355
Oh, my God. Dennis, no.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.183
Y-You're supposed
to be here next week.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.184
No, it was this week.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.273
Uh, for sure it was this week.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.362
Oh, my God, it wasthis week.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.408
-You know, this is,
this is humiliating.
-Did something happen?

02:27.451 --> 02:28.974
-I must have overbooked...
-Oh.

02:29.018 --> 02:31.412
-...this Airbnb,
and that's a problem...
-Oh, my gosh.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.979
-...because we only have
the one room, so...
-We can work this out,

02:34.023 --> 02:35.633
because I think
we can probably stay

02:35.677 --> 02:37.853
in the same room to-together.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.550
It wouldn't bother me
if it wouldn't bother you.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.031
I mean, I-I don't like to come
off as a difficult person.

02:42.074 --> 02:45.208
-Um...-Oh. Now, d-do you like to comeoff as a difficult person?

02:45.252 --> 02:47.384
- No.
-No. Of course not.
-Oh, no.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.777
-Who-who would? Who would?
-Yeah. No, no one likes

02:48.820 --> 02:50.909
to be a difficult person,
so we can make it work.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.260
-I'm Dennis.
-: Uh...

02:53.303 --> 02:54.652
I don't think my husband and I
would be comfortable

02:54.696 --> 02:56.263
sharing a room.

02:57.307 --> 02:59.048
Husband?

02:59.091 --> 03:02.617
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
that you were married.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.054
-I didn't realize
I had to tell you that.
-DENNIS: Yeah.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.622
-Oh...
-GREG: Uh, hi.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.798
-Uh, one of you guys
must be Mac.
-Yeah, that's me.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.930
-You, you're the husband.
-Mm-hmm.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.454
I see. Uh, this is Dennis.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.456
-What's up?
-He's also gonna be
staying here.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.632
-Well...
-Yeah, you know what? Maybewe should just get another room.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.722
-Oh, no, no. I mean, maybe.
-We're gonna make it work.
Well, you guys crash in there,

03:20.765 --> 03:23.028
-and Dennis will
stay in my room.
-Uh, I don't know.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.943
I don't know. I don't think so.Uh, I'm good.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.641
-I-I'm not gonna.
-Oh, well, it's just that you,

03:26.684 --> 03:28.730
you just said that you were coolsharing a room, so...

03:28.773 --> 03:30.384
DENNIS:
Right. Yeah,
but I was, uh, you know,

03:30.427 --> 03:32.342
I'm-I'm, but, you know, ch--

03:32.386 --> 03:33.865
Things change.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.650
Yeah. It's just that you don't
have anywhere to go.

03:35.693 --> 03:36.868
Well, you wouldn't know that.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.261
-Yeah, somehow I do.
-Yeah...

03:38.305 --> 03:40.263
Hey, we're just really tired

03:40.307 --> 03:42.700
and would love to crash,
if that's okay.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.180
Absolutely. Yeah, you guys,
you guys hit the hay.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.921
We're probably gonna
hit the hay, too.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.488
-Thank you.-All right, yeah. Best of luck.-Absolutely.

03:47.531 --> 03:48.532
-Thank you.-Yeah, we're gonna work it out.

03:48.576 --> 03:49.881
-It's not gonna be an issue.
-All right. Thanks.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.013
Have a great night, guys.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.494
CHARLIE:
This is so exciting.

03:53.537 --> 03:54.712
-Yeah.
-Now, you said they're,

03:54.756 --> 03:55.974
uh, where are these girls from?

03:56.018 --> 03:57.889
-Australia? Or what is that...?-No, no.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.500
They're two Austrian broads.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.545
-Aww...
-Alexi and Nikki.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.373
Oh, wowee, Frank.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.332
Those names are,
those names are like...

04:05.375 --> 04:08.900
Before they get here, we got
to lay down some ground rules.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.294
When we wind up
working the same broad,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.557
no eye contact
between the two of us.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.342
-Wait, what?-And they're gonna encourage us

04:15.385 --> 04:17.648
-to explore each other's bodies.
-What?

04:17.692 --> 04:20.911
-A-And that's a hard no for me.-No, for me, too.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.436
-Let's lead with that.
-Wait, what's about to happen?

04:22.479 --> 04:24.394
-I'm not sure I want...

04:24.438 --> 04:26.527
Keep your fingers to yourself.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.529
-But have a good time.
-Uh... Hey, can...

04:28.572 --> 04:30.661
I just kind of want you
to explain what you...

04:30.705 --> 04:33.577
-Yeah.
-...what you got on your mind
here, but...

04:33.621 --> 04:35.100
Who the hell are you?

04:35.144 --> 04:36.798
Hi. We're here for the room.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.190
Nah, no, no, no, no, no.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.410
We're waiting
for Nikki and Alexi.

04:40.454 --> 04:44.327
Yeah. I am Nikki,
and this is my father Alexi.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.808
Oh, shit.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.558
What is this, man?

04:57.601 --> 04:59.386
W-What, what are we doing?

04:59.429 --> 05:01.170
I-I don't want to do this
anymore. Can we stop?

05:01.213 --> 05:02.563
Huh? No, we can't stop now.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.391
We're-we're right on track.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.740
I don't know, man. It just...

05:05.783 --> 05:07.611
It just feels like
a-a lot of effort,

05:07.655 --> 05:08.786
and it feels desperate,
you know what I mean?

05:08.830 --> 05:10.266
Like, I-I never put
this much work

05:10.310 --> 05:12.181
into banging some cute meat.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.617
Cute meat?

05:13.661 --> 05:14.966
Cute meat.
That-that was your phrase.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.490
No, Dennis, "meet-cute."

05:16.533 --> 05:18.796
It has a name, Mac.
Its name is Lisa.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.537
This is fun, right?This is the banter. This is the,

05:20.581 --> 05:22.800
this is-- this is all
a part of act one banter.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.194
And we are right on schedule.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.239
-Shh. Listen.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.633
They're fighting.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.766
I'm telling you,their marriage is on the rocks.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.071
-What-what, wait-wait-wait.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.508
What's that third noise?

05:34.551 --> 05:36.423
Dude, i-is that,
like, a chicken or a parrot

05:36.466 --> 05:38.381
or some shit? Dude, uh,
I thought we said no animals.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.991
Mac, tell them
no animals in my room.

05:40.035 --> 05:43.299
-That's no animal.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.649
-Oh...
-We needed reinforcements.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.434
-Okay, catch me up to speed.
-Shh, shh.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.218
-Listen, listen. -LISA: You can't keep blaming me

05:49.261 --> 05:51.394
-for what happened with Teddy.
-Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.527
-Who is Teddy?
-Mm...

05:53.570 --> 05:55.485
The wife must have cheated
on the husband

05:55.529 --> 05:56.617
with some guy named Teddy.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.183
No, no, no, that's all wrong.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.663
The female love interest
can't be a cheater,

05:59.707 --> 06:01.404
because that makes her
unlikable.

06:01.448 --> 06:05.452
Maybe this isn't a romantic
comedy about the wife at all.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.671
Maybe it's about the husband.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.978
Yes. The husband
is the lonely heart

06:10.021 --> 06:13.068
who needs to find love
in the big city.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.462
Dee, you're my new
romantic lead,

06:15.505 --> 06:19.814
proving that romantic leadsdon't have to be likable at all.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.077
-I'm sorry, I can't follow
any of this. Am I in or out?
-You're out.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.644
-Great. I'm gonna go sleep
in the living room.
-Okay.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.907
-Uh...
-Awesome.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.700
Charlie, this is weird as shit.

06:36.744 --> 06:40.095
Yeah. Hey-- hey, uh,
Nikki, what's this

06:40.138 --> 06:41.836
-that we're listening to
here, pal?
-NIKKI: Oh.

06:41.879 --> 06:44.621
It's just a little bit
of music that I wrote.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.841
-Ah, you're a,
you're a yodeler, huh?

06:46.884 --> 06:50.322
Uh, y-yeah. Uh, may I ask
if you have a small pot

06:50.366 --> 06:53.282
-that I can boil
these lederhosen in?
-Uh, yeah.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.327
I got something. Uh,
let me just look around here.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.679
What do you got going there
with the toe?

06:58.722 --> 07:01.377
-FRANK: Does he speak English?
-No, and sadly,

07:01.421 --> 07:03.335
-he refuses to learn.
-CHARLIE: Oh, yeah.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.120
Oh, yeah, Frank doesn't like
to learn new things either.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.817
Here you go.
Tha-That should work.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.515
Ask him what he's
working that toe with.

07:12.736 --> 07:15.130
Um, how do you say...
There is no word.

07:15.173 --> 07:19.917
Uh, "toe spoon,"for the digging out of the toe.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.746
-Mmm.
-Don't flick it.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.618
Hey, Frank, can I talk to you
for a second over here, man?

07:24.661 --> 07:26.402
-Mind if we just...
-Yeah.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.624
Dude, this is weird as hell man.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.582
We gotta--We're just gonna have to, like,

07:32.626 --> 07:33.714
power through this night,

07:33.757 --> 07:35.280
and then we'll figure
something out tomorrow, man.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.065
All right? We'll just--
Let's just get into bed,

07:37.108 --> 07:39.633
and get out of here.
Hey, hey, guys, you know,

07:39.676 --> 07:41.896
-we figure we should
just turn in early.
-We're gonna go to sleep

07:41.939 --> 07:43.637
-right now.
-'Cause the night goes
quicker, you know?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.334
-We usually sleep ass to ass.
-That's true.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.205
But let's see if we can...

07:47.249 --> 07:48.946
-I call the side.
-I'll get--

07:48.990 --> 07:51.209
-You got the end, huh?
-Yeah. Picked the side here.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.343
-Why don't you hop in.
-All right, I'll hop in.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.562
-Yeah.
-All right.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.302
Well, ass to ass.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.956
-FRANK: We're ass to ass.
-Here we go.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.002
All right.

08:11.621 --> 08:12.622
Fuck this.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.153
Dennis. Come here.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.200
-What-- What are you doing, man?-Shh! Shh.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.201
Wh-Why are you in their room?

08:26.244 --> 08:27.463
-Shh, shh, shh.
-What?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.031
I just set up the perfect
meet-cute for Dee.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.554
-Okay.
-See, Greg's in the shower,

08:31.598 --> 08:32.903
so I snuck in there,
I picked the lock,

08:32.947 --> 08:34.470
and I just made my way in.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.688
I checked him out
for a quick second.

08:35.732 --> 08:36.951
He has a tiny penis,
just for the record.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.429
-Ah.
-Then, I open up the toilet.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.563
I shit, like, my brains out
into it, right?

08:40.607 --> 08:41.956
I came at this thing
like an animal, man.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.697
And then I took a bunch
of toilet paper.

08:43.740 --> 08:44.785
I-I jammed it in there

08:44.828 --> 08:46.787
so it won't flush;
it won't flush.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.658
Why?

08:48.702 --> 08:49.572
Because when Greg
gets out of the shower,

08:49.616 --> 08:51.922
he's gonna realize that
this toilet is a mess.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.358
I mean, it is a splatter-fest.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.925
He's gonna look for a plunger.
There is no plunger.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.014
I'm gonna send him down
to the hardware store,

08:57.058 --> 08:58.668
where he's gonna run into Dee.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.670
GREG:
Oh, my God!

09:00.714 --> 09:02.716
Greg, y--
Are you okay in there?

09:02.759 --> 09:05.849
Um, no. I-I think there's
a problem with the toilet.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.938
You may need to get a plunger.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.506
A plunger? Oh, man, we don't
really even have a plunger

09:10.550 --> 09:11.812
here in the apartment,

09:11.855 --> 09:13.465
but we have a hardware store
down the street.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.729
If you go down there and get it,I can get you back.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.426
GREG:Okay. Hey, when did this happen?

09:17.469 --> 09:19.036
Wh-What?

09:19.080 --> 09:22.083
GREG:
The shit in the toilet.
It's not mine.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.737
Oh, my God,
when did that happen?

09:23.780 --> 09:26.391
-Just close the door.
-That's what I'm asking you.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.742
-Okay, now the plan is
in motion for you.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.613
What do you mean the plan's
in motion for me?

09:30.657 --> 09:31.875
I thought I was out.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.224
Remember when we were
saying that

09:33.268 --> 09:35.749
the female romantic lead
would never cheat?

09:35.792 --> 09:37.011
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, well, I overheard Lisa

09:37.054 --> 09:39.535
saying to Greg that
she misses Teddy.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.755
Huh? Why would she tell Greg

09:41.798 --> 09:43.278
that she misses the guy
that she cheated with?

09:43.321 --> 09:46.716
Unless she didn't
cheat on him with Teddy.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.065
Maybe Teddy was
a platonic friend

09:48.109 --> 09:50.546
from high school
that makes Greg jealous.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.678
Don't you know what this means?

09:51.721 --> 09:54.637
Lisa is still our romantic lead,which means...

09:54.681 --> 09:57.031
-So I'm still your leading man.-Yeah.

10:02.776 --> 10:03.777
-This is crazy, Charlie.
-Yeah, I know.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.301
I mean, Dennis is having
meet cubes with hot chicks,

10:06.344 --> 10:07.781
-and we're stuck
with these guys.
-I know.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.521
I want to be having
meet cubes, right?

10:09.565 --> 10:11.523
-Me, too. Me, too.

10:11.567 --> 10:12.742
What the hell?
What the hell is he doing?

10:12.786 --> 10:13.656
I don't know what he's doing.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.223
What are you--
What are you doing there?

10:15.266 --> 10:17.312
What-- What are you doing
with the spoon?

10:17.355 --> 10:20.750
You can't get to thehard-to-reach places with that.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.883
You need a knife.
You need an edge.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.536
-Here, take this.
-What, uh--

10:24.580 --> 10:25.929
CHARLIE:
What are you working on
over here, pal?

10:25.973 --> 10:27.714
Because, you know,
Frank and I have

10:27.757 --> 10:30.717
a very specific diet;
we like to eat pretty clean.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.719
And I don't want to...

10:32.762 --> 10:34.372
-That is, uh, sausage...
-Yeah.

10:34.416 --> 10:38.725
-...mit peanut butter
und apricot jam sandwich.
-Hmm.

10:38.768 --> 10:42.946
But the trick is to melt
the cheese on the outside.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.513
Well, that's right, you put
peanut butter on the inside,

10:44.556 --> 10:46.080
you put the cheese
on the outside.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.256
But you don't want to burn thatcheese, right, so you...

10:48.299 --> 10:50.867
BOTH:
...so you finish it
on the radiator.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.957
I do that, too. I didn't think
anyone did that, man!

10:54.001 --> 10:55.480
And that is the trick.
That's how you do it.

10:55.524 --> 10:56.830
-That's exactly-- Exactly.
-Exactly.

10:56.873 --> 11:00.485
Hey, Charlie,
this is pretty good.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.749
You can get in there
behind the toe,

11:02.792 --> 11:05.186
and it's rounded,
so you don't have a chance

11:05.229 --> 11:07.492
of filletin'yourself.

11:07.536 --> 11:08.580
Probably shouldn't share it,
though, guys.

11:08.624 --> 11:09.843
It's not--
That's not sanitary.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.888
I got a question.Tell me if it's asking too much,

11:11.932 --> 11:14.543
but I've always kind of
seen myself as a yodeler.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.546
Would you be willing to show mehow you do that?

11:17.589 --> 11:19.504
I would like that very much.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.637
-For real?
Okay, 'cause I feel like

11:21.681 --> 11:24.596
if I... if I learn how to yodel,I'm going places.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.294
You know what I mean?
Because, like, no one...

11:26.337 --> 11:28.775
-no one's doing that these days.-: Charlie.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.647
-Charlie, come here.
-Uh, give me one second.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.779
Yo, what's up?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.781
We just got a hit
on the apartment.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.391
Two European broads.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.001
Oh, I don't know, man,
things are starting to really

11:38.045 --> 11:39.176
-turn a corner with these guys.-Yeah, I know.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.787
I mean, you know,
I'm having fun.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.136
-I like the spoon.
-And you got that.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.094
-I guess... Okay, but you know.-Yeah. Yeah, ooh...

11:44.138 --> 11:46.488
And...

11:53.016 --> 11:55.018
-Sorry, no. We double-booked.
-Sorry, guys.
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.238
-We're gonna miss you.-You know, these things happen.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.936
-We-we just double-booked.
-Thanks for the toe spoon.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.678
Yeah, thanks so much, guys.
Good-bye.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.249
Oops.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.903
-Sorry.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.774
That was pretty cute,
wasn't it, how we...

12:11.818 --> 12:14.255
both reached for the plunger
at the same time?

12:14.298 --> 12:15.778
-Yeah, I guess.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.475
Also, looks like
it's the only one.

12:17.519 --> 12:21.392
It's the last one, so, um...
maybe we could share it.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.786
How would that work?

12:23.830 --> 12:26.963
Well, I guess, first you'd haveto come back to my place.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.183
You know, I can always
use a man

12:29.226 --> 12:32.186
to help me clean my pipes.

12:32.229 --> 12:36.843
Help flushing the shit you tookthat backed up your toilet?

12:36.886 --> 12:39.846
No. No, that's--
No, that's-- it wasn't shit.

12:39.889 --> 12:42.065
-That's not what I'm talking
about. It wasn't shit.
-What was it?

12:42.109 --> 12:43.197
-I don't care.
-Okay, it doesn't matter.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.198
The point is that

12:44.241 --> 12:45.895
it's-it's charming and cute
and fun

12:45.939 --> 12:47.897
how we, how we just sort of metlike this over a plunger.

12:47.941 --> 12:48.855
Don't you think so?

12:48.898 --> 12:50.944
I'm just gonna go
to another hardware store.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.815
Well, okay. Well, hold on
a second. Wait, wait.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.208
Don't go.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.864
There we go.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.997
Pushing away his soul mate,
right on structure.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.304
End act two.

13:12.139 --> 13:15.055
Hey! It's my roomie.
What's going on?

13:15.098 --> 13:16.708
Hi.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.841
-I got you some wine.
-Oh, no, thank you.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.975
Well, it helps when you're sad.You seem sad.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.455
But I-I get it.
I-I understand.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.979
-You do?
-Oh, yeah.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.983
Yeah, you miss Teddy,
and no one can replace him.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.767
I assume you overheard
my husband and I.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.116
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.553
But, look, maybe I can
fill that void, you know,

13:35.597 --> 13:38.034
if only for a few hours
of, uh, sexual bliss.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.994
Oh, no. What?

13:41.037 --> 13:43.083
Sex.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.562
Bangin'.

13:44.606 --> 13:47.217
It's good to take
the mind off things. You know?

13:47.261 --> 13:49.219
But wait, l-let me, let meease your mind about something.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.786
I'm not the jealous type,
like your husband.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.006
You know, you want to spend timewith Teddy also, uh,

13:53.049 --> 13:54.572
-that's fine, you know.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.271
Dig that guy up, you know, seewhat he's been up to these days.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.969
I honestly don't give a shit.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.885
-Yeah.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.321
You all right?

14:04.365 --> 14:07.150
-What?
-Oh.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.151
What happened?

14:09.587 --> 14:11.807
This is so bad.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.071
Don't talk about him.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.120
-Okay, that went great.
-Huh?

14:20.163 --> 14:21.469
-Now, next steps...
-Whoa.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.123
How, in your mind,
did that go great?

14:23.166 --> 14:24.385
-I thought the crying was hot.
-I did, too.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.387
But it just, it seems like
it's gonna be annoying.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.389
I find you annoying.
This whole thing's annoying.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.044
-I'm gonna go back to my thing.-No, Dennis, this is working.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.828
You just have to trust
the structure.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.048
-Uh, nah.
-Just trust the structure.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.836
-Yeah... Come on in, come on in.-Well, yeah, come on in.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.403
Oh, this... this is the spot.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.013
-Sorry it's messy.
-It's a little messy.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.362
We had a guest,
and he trashed the joint.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.929
That's right, the-the guest
trashed the place.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.149
No, it is perfect.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.020
-Uh, so much space.
-Mm-hmm.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.195
-Yeah.
-Looks very bohemian.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.632
And I like that the bathroom
down the hall is so close.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.199
-Yeah, it's right,
it's right there.
-It's not far, right?

14:56.243 --> 14:58.158
-I mean, there's no door on it.-Yeah.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.638
But that's because the guy in 4Bwent berserk and ripped it off.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.031
-Oh.
-Uh, yeah.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.554
And if you do have to
use the bathroom,

15:03.598 --> 15:05.774
-what I can do is
I can become the door for you.
-Yeah.

15:05.817 --> 15:08.211
-I do that for Frank when
he's taking a dump in there.
-You stand in front of it.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.386
No, no, no, it is okay.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.041
We're very free with our bodies.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.086
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, yeah?

15:13.129 --> 15:14.957
-Mm-hmm.-Cool. Yeah, us, too. I mean...

15:15.001 --> 15:17.525
-I only see one bed.
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's a one-bedder.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.222
-Uh...
-Oh.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.745
-We can sleep on the floor...
-No, no, no, no, no.
-No.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.182
That's no fun.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.184
-We should all share. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

15:24.227 --> 15:27.404
-Yeah, that's okay with me.
Is that okay with you?
-No fun to sleep...

15:27.448 --> 15:29.624
-Yeah, here on the bed.
-Ah-ah-ah.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.843
That is not very free
with your body.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.107
-Uh... what do you mean?
-Wh-Wh-What?

15:34.150 --> 15:36.196
-We all sleep naked.
It's more fun.
-Mm-hmm.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.198
-Come, we don't bite.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.200
-Yeah, just take it off. Come.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.202
MAC:
So you're telling me

15:42.245 --> 15:44.117
that you got nowhere with Greg?

15:44.160 --> 15:45.683
That's not true.
That's not true at all.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.642
Got him right where I want him.This is the part

15:47.685 --> 15:50.819
where I sit back and wait
for him to come to his senses.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.995
Th-That-That's not how it works. Goddamn it.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.866
This is the part
where the trashy skank

15:54.910 --> 15:57.869
is-is supposed to lure
the husband away.

15:57.913 --> 16:01.395
He bangs that nasty snatch,
and then Lisa recognizes

16:01.438 --> 16:04.615
that he is a dullard
and needs to drop him,

16:04.659 --> 16:07.618
so that Lisa,
the true hero of the story,

16:07.662 --> 16:10.273
can figure out that she needs
to be free and find love.

16:10.317 --> 16:13.711
-I'm the true hero of the story.-You are a diversionary
plot twist at best.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.626
-And you couldn't even
do that right.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.063
-Ooh, what a night! Wha...!

16:17.106 --> 16:19.065
-You can't believe
what happened.
-Whew!

16:19.108 --> 16:21.067
FRANK:
We got the backpackers
we wanted,

16:21.110 --> 16:23.069
and they're as sexually free
as we hoped.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.071
-Those girls are wild, man.
-It was amazing.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.073
They wanted us to, like-like,
touch each other and stuff.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.161
I'm like, "Dude,
that's a hard no for me."

16:28.204 --> 16:29.075
No, it was a hard no
for me, too.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.598
-Well, but...
-I said no.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.469
-I said no.
-You were thinking
about it, though.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.471
-All of a sudden, like,
Frank gives me one of those...-No, I wasn't thinking about it.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.734
-I'm like, "Are you kidding me?"I'm not gonna do that.
-No, no, no, I wasn't...

16:38.910 --> 16:40.695
I can't even understand them
half the time.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.610
-It's like the accents...
-I don't know.
They were crazy chicks.

16:42.653 --> 16:43.872
Hey, hoping you're
having fun with your

The whole world's upside down.

16:58.495 --> 17:01.455

-Straight is gay.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.717

17:02.760 --> 17:04.632
-What?-Maybe Teddy cheated with Greg.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.506

17:09.550 --> 17:11.682

-I will.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.215

-Get your hand off me.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.305
Yeah, get your hands off him.
We don't need your help.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.654

gonna end up cutting you

Okay, but just a heads-up:

17:33.574 --> 17:37.012
It's not gonna work, all right?Men are not in charge anymore.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.362

get to just decide

17:39.406 --> 17:40.798
what women get to do...

17:44.280 --> 17:46.587
Hey, Frank.

17:46.630 --> 17:47.588

17:49.285 --> 17:51.244

that was your finger, Charlie,

17:51.287 --> 17:52.332
I'm gonna be pissed.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.377
No, that was,
that was definitely Minka.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.249

with the fingers.
-Oh, my...

about Alexi and Nikki.

Something doesn't feel right.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.301

18:57.484 --> 18:58.876

-That's the one.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.501
Um...

19:58.545 --> 20:01.504
I know that what you had
with Teddy was special,

20:01.548 --> 20:03.376
and I know that I could
never replace him.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.291
But that's dead and buried now,man, and you got to move on.

that it's crazy.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.295

we just met, but I feel like

20:09.338 --> 20:11.384
if-if you just give us a chance,

20:11.427 --> 20:14.648
we could tell a love storyfor the ages.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.745
and-and maybe it's not even
ready for the mainstream,

20:24.788 --> 20:26.747
but it'll win a ton of awards,
and it'll get

20:26.790 --> 20:28.662
a shit ton of attention
for the liberal press.

20:28.705 --> 20:31.186

what you're talking about.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.450

your toilet, Greg.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.931
It was me. It was always me.

20:36.974 --> 20:40.282

was Teddy.
