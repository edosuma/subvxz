Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.402
Thus shall it come to pass.

00:27.486 --> 00:30.530
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.865
Where did you hear that?
Who told you that?

00:32.950 --> 00:35.868
The Hybrid. On the Baseship
before they unplugged it.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.954
I've got to find out
about these visions.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.375
Plug it in.
It's time to get some answers.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.461
Can I see what you drew?

00:49.007 --> 00:50.216
ATHENA: Hera?

00:55.931 --> 00:57.640
Get away from my child.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.308
You are never
gonna take Hera.

Quickly. All right. On three.
One, two, three. Lift.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.513
Keep some pressure on that wound
until I can get to the artery.

MAN: Kidnapped?
President's been kidnapped?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.688
Baltar? I heard Baltar was with her.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.106
Are you saying
he's responsible?

01:47.191 --> 01:48.399
I heard it was the Cylons.

01:48.484 --> 01:49.984
No. My people say
she was shot.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.569
What are you talking about?
Roslin?

01:51.653 --> 01:55.448
No, one of Adama's Marines shot a Cylon,
and that is how this entire thing has begun.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.158
So then where is Zarek?
MAN: I don't know!

01:57.284 --> 01:59.243
Where is Zarek? WOMAN:
Who is in charge here?

01:59.328 --> 02:01.412
Sir, Vice President Zarek is
still waiting to talk to you.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.664
What should I tell him? Sir?

02:07.044 --> 02:10.046
Decker says they've just shipped
over the last of the Vipers.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.549
That means we're down 40
birds, almost as many jocks.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.929
We're gonna have to reconfigure the
CAP, rethink our defense posture.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.972
Where is she?
COTTLE: Clamp.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.349
Marines are holding her.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.812
WOMAN: Nobody has
told us anything.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.021
MAN: No, no, no.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.983
Mr. Vice President, I have
some questions for you.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.069
Thank you.
Just calm down, please.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.489
Everybody! Everybody
just calm down, please.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.283
Mr. Vice President, it's
really important that we know.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.993
Is the President dead?

02:41.078 --> 02:42.119
We have no information...

02:42.204 --> 02:43.955
WOMAN: I heard she was
assassinated by the Cylons.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.290
No, there is no truth to that,
at least as far as we know.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.501
Well, then what the hell
do we know?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.962
Clearly, our first priority
is to get out as much

02:51.046 --> 02:54.924
verifiable information as we
can to avoid a general panic.

02:55.008 --> 02:59.512
To that end, I asked Admiral Adama to
come and answer our questions directly.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.390
Unfortunately,
he wouldn't take my call.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.475

when there is...

03:04.601 --> 03:05.685
(ALL CLAMORING)
However...

03:05.769 --> 03:08.729
However... Please.
Please, just a moment.

03:17.406 --> 03:20.616
ZAREK: President Roslin was
apparently aboard the Cylon Baseship,

03:20.701 --> 03:23.619
along with Gaius Baltar
and many of Galactica's pilots

03:23.704 --> 03:25.079
when it jumped away,

03:25.163 --> 03:28.916
after one of their own leaders
was shot aboard Galactica.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.627
We have no idea
when or if they'll return,

03:31.712 --> 03:36.090
or if the President or the other
captives will be subject to reprisals.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.650
For now, the powers granted me by law,

03:55.319 --> 03:57.486
I have taken over
as President.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.779

(PEOPLE BANGING ON TABLE)

04:11.168 --> 04:13.252
(HEART MONITOR FLATLINING)

04:23.430 --> 04:25.181
By refusing even
to meet with Zarek,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.975
you're simply helping him
fan the Quorum's suspicions.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.977
Their suspicions
don't concern me.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.688
Look, maybe he's not
the man we hoped for,

04:32.773 --> 04:36.817
but he is next in line, and the
Fleet needs reassurance and stability.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.278
Frankly, the kind that only its
military commander can offer.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.573
If this Fleet needs reassurance,
then you reassure them.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.492
That's your job now.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.203
You can tell Zarek
he can go to hell.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.541
Why?

04:52.709 --> 04:53.709
ATHENA: Sir.

04:53.794 --> 04:58.923
Do you hate your people so much that
you look for any excuse to kill one?

04:59.007 --> 05:02.510
Or did you deliberately try
to sabotage this truce?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.221
No, sir. Of course not.

05:05.681 --> 05:10.101
Then you tell me why. You make
me understand why you did this.

05:15.065 --> 05:20.027
They were gonna take her. The
Six. She was gonna take my child.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.657
There were too many witnesses.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.202
They all said the same thing.
Your daughter was lost.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.039
The Cylon merely kneeled down,
was talking to her.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.083
Maybe that's what it looked
like to the others, sir.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.876
But I know.
Oh, you knew better...

05:35.961 --> 05:40.798
I had a vision, a vision where the Six
and Baltar were taking Hera away from me.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.174
A vision.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.595
It was more than
just a vision, sir.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.848
When I saw them together, I
knew that they would take her,

05:48.932 --> 05:51.308
that they would
take away my child!

05:51.393 --> 05:55.646
You murdered an unarmed
woman, and by doing so,

05:55.731 --> 05:59.608
you put the lives of every single
person in this fleet at risk,

06:00.277 --> 06:04.447
and quite possibly cost the lives
of the President and your husband.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.743
You disobeyed the direct
orders of a superior officer,

06:08.827 --> 06:10.661
but, more importantly,

06:12.289 --> 06:14.290
you betrayed
a promise to me.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.460
I trusted you.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.967
Sir, I will accept any form of
punishment that you think I deserve.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.888
I just ask that you please
don't take away Hera.

06:28.972 --> 06:33.142
I'm afraid the brig is no
place for a little girl.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.437
Guards!

06:39.441 --> 06:40.566
Get her out of my sight.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.817
Yes, sir.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.740
WOMAN: At one time, Admiral Adama
supported Gaius Baltar's administration.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.533
Isn't there a chance
he'd support yours?

06:49.618 --> 06:52.286
I'm afraid only Admiral
Adama can answer that.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.539
MAN: Then I will address this
question to Delegate Adama.

06:55.624 --> 07:00.669
Do you honestly think that your father
will hand over power to this administration?

07:04.341 --> 07:05.424
No.

(THEME MUSIC)

08:01.231 --> 08:03.482
Fine. Yeah.

08:04.151 --> 08:08.279
Recon Raptor just reported back.
The Resurrection hub's gone.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.447
No sign of the Baseship
carrying the President,

08:10.532 --> 08:13.409
assuming that's where
they were headed.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.078
They were determined to
resurrect the Three,

08:16.163 --> 08:18.289
what we used to call D'Anna.

08:19.082 --> 08:23.794
To do that, they gotta go to the
hub. You find it, we'll find them.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.838
Easier said than done.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.089
Maybe.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.216
We got another problem, sir.

08:29.301 --> 08:33.179
Starbuck's having trouble fielding
enough planes to fly a standard CAP.

08:33.263 --> 08:38.100
Wants us to consider having the Fleet
bunch up tighter, so it's easier to defend.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.438
Means counting on a bunch of
civvies flying close formation.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.647
Yeah.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.317
Organize it.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.076
I got you appointed
to this job.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.955
Pulled strings,
called in favors,

09:00.624 --> 09:03.626
all because I thought
you might do some good.

09:05.003 --> 09:09.798
Now you're advising me to
step aside from a position

09:09.883 --> 09:12.635
that by law is mine.

09:13.929 --> 09:16.180
A position
I was elected to.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.057
But you were never
elected President.

09:18.141 --> 09:24.438
But I was elected to office, which
is more than Roslin can claim.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.653
Why do you think she kept
me on in the first place?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.614
To thank me
for rolling over? No.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.952
No, to help
legitimize her coup.

09:38.370 --> 09:43.624
In the military, we used to
talk about facts on the ground.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.044
Well, the facts
on the ground are these,

09:47.128 --> 09:50.506
right or wrong, Adama will
never recognize you as president,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.591
and we need
someone he will.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.677
Now the Quorum
has a legal authority

09:54.761 --> 09:57.221
to appoint an interim
president in a time of crisis.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.015
And I suppose
you have someone in mind?

10:01.518 --> 10:02.559
No.

10:03.478 --> 10:07.314
No, not yet, which is why we
need to form a search committee

10:07.399 --> 10:10.818
and start looking for a
candidate as soon as possible.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.405
Well, good luck with that.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.535
MAN ON RADIO:
Mr. Vice President Zarek,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.453
do you really believe that
this government's in danger?

10:21.538 --> 10:22.579
ZAREK: Let's face facts here.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.082
What we had these past five
years isn't a true government,

10:25.166 --> 10:27.710
but a tacit agreement
between a military strongman

10:27.794 --> 10:30.754
and a political strongwoman
to rule together by fiat.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.548
MAN: I've heard you asked
the Quorum to authorize

10:32.632 --> 10:35.259
the creation
of a civil defense force?

10:35.343 --> 10:37.594
After what happened during
the last military coup,

10:37.679 --> 10:42.057
we don't want to depend on Galactica's
Marines to guarantee our safety.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.437
You see the problem?

10:50.066 --> 10:52.776
Lampkin's first rule
of legal dynamics,

10:53.403 --> 10:58.449
when an irresistible force
meets immovable object,

11:00.160 --> 11:01.577
stand aside,

11:03.747 --> 11:06.290
and wait for
the class-action suit.

11:06.374 --> 11:10.294
Except I'm not sure if it's to
anyone's benefit if we just sit around,

11:10.378 --> 11:12.838
waiting to pick up the pieces.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.674
This thing's heading for a showdown.
There's gonna be bloodshed, unless...

11:15.759 --> 11:20.012
Unless you can find someone else,
someone your father won't reject,

11:20.096 --> 11:22.431
someone the Quorum
will approve of,

11:22.515 --> 11:26.560
someone to take Tom Zarek's
place as interim president

11:26.644 --> 11:29.104
until the next round
of elections.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.611
Don't take the case,
Counselor.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.446
It's a loser.

11:39.074 --> 11:42.368
I have to. We have to.

11:46.873 --> 11:50.084
No one on the Quorum is
going to lift a finger.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.922
Zarek's got them inhaling
fear and exhaling anger.

11:55.006 --> 11:59.009
But you have taken the pulse of
the Fleet and you know character.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.721
And, frankly, you need a
reason to get out of this room,

12:02.806 --> 12:06.850
unless you want to start discussing
what's been keeping you here.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.069
So you won't be
dissuaded, will you?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.781
Not even when you
hear my fee?

12:22.325 --> 12:23.367
Fee?

12:23.451 --> 12:26.912
Appearances to the contrary, I'm
actually in this for the money.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.123
I have a reputation
to maintain, after all.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.501
Okay, so what did Roslin
offer you to defend Baltar?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.712
Room with a view.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.299
Well, I'm not sure
I can improve on that.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.219
Then pro bono it is,
Counselor.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.888
Word to the wise,

12:45.223 --> 12:49.101
sometimes it's better to settle
for what you've already got.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.483
ADAMA: Colonel Tigh.

12:56.568 --> 13:01.405
I understand you've developed a
relationship with the Cylon prisoner.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.993
That's not the word I'd use, but
she has been more cooperative.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.580
See if she'll tell you
anything about the hub.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.419
Bill.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.548
We'll find her.
We'll find all of them.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.643
Your Resurrection hub,
how do we find it?

13:31.728 --> 13:33.103
I'm sure the others
have told you.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.897
You tell me.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.153
Only our Hybrids
can locate it.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.739
And then only
after it completes a jump.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.532
Even they can't anticipate
where it's going.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.994
You're holding back
something. I know it.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.078
You're lying.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.331
I have never
lied to you, Saul.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.540
Why don't you
trust me now?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.001
Because there are too
many lives at stake, lady.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.212
Your buddies took off
with half an air wing,

13:58.296 --> 14:02.132
not to mention the President of
the frakking Colonies herself.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.135
She's the real reason
you're so angry, so worried.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.429
I can hear it
in your voice.

14:07.514 --> 14:11.058
Why? Why is a dying woman
so important to you?

14:11.142 --> 14:13.936
Not to me, Gods damn it. To the old man.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.688
Admiral Adama?

14:31.788 --> 14:32.871
Saul.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.624
Do you love me?
What?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.252
Be honest with me.
I've been honest with you.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.128
I don't believe this.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.506
You're asking me...

14:44.133 --> 14:45.092
OFFICER ON P.A.: Attention.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.718
(ALARM BLARING) Set Condition
One throughout the ship.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.970
This is not a drill.
This is not a drill.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.388
This has gone
too frakking far.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.349
I don't know what kind of mind
games you are playing with me, lady,

14:52.433 --> 14:54.101
but it ends here!

15:03.528 --> 15:04.611
What do we got?

15:04.696 --> 15:07.864
One of our missing Raptors
jumped into dradis range.

15:07.949 --> 15:08.949
You're sure it's ours?

15:09.033 --> 15:10.200
ADAMA: Transponder checks out,

15:10.285 --> 15:12.494
it's one of the Raptors that
boarded the rebel Baseship.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.246
No radiological signature.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.999
Racetrack and Skulls are
on their way to intercept.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.962
RACETRACK ON RADIO: Actual,
Racetrack. I'm eyeballing our bird now.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.507
Looks shot to hell.
Venting fuel and O2.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.969
Still no response to hails.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.389
Someone had to jump
that bird.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.436
I can't see a frakking thing from here.

15:38.146 --> 15:41.106
Skulls, take the wheel,
I'm going for a walk.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.826
Decompression check okay.
Opening hatch.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.007
Safety line secure.
Moving toward the Raptor.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.068
I'm seeing major damage
to the canopy.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.820
Looks empty inside.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.750
(GRUNTING)

16:45.421 --> 16:47.964
I have the hatch open,
but it's stuck.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.385
Grav field's off.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.476
It's Pike. He's dead.

17:31.300 --> 17:35.554
This is the shuttle she
took over to the Baseship.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.557
Laird was able to salvage
the flight data recorder,

17:38.641 --> 17:42.144
puts the originating jump
point deep in Sector Delta 9.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.397
President Zarek
called again.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.400
He heard about the Raptor,
and he's waiting to be briefed.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.653
Recall the CAP.
Spin up the FTLs.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.738
What about the Fleet?

17:52.822 --> 17:54.322
Let's go.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.450
LAMPKIN: We are essentially
looking for an understudy.

17:56.534 --> 18:00.287
The quandary is one doesn't
generally get the chance

18:00.371 --> 18:05.041
to wield political power without
the ambition to actively seek it.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.918
(LANCE MEOWS)
Easy, Lance.

18:07.003 --> 18:13.091
That same ambition often compromises the
unselfish motives that begat the quest.

18:13.843 --> 18:17.804
In other words, a battle of id
versus ego that ego rarely wins.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.308
Roslin never sought power.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.643
Exception
that proves the rule.

18:23.728 --> 18:27.856
One could argue that Laura Roslin
is a study in repressed ambition.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.525
Just like you, Mr. Adama.

18:31.027 --> 18:34.196
Never seeking out a job
until it's handed to you.

18:34.697 --> 18:38.116
Flight leader, Battlestar
commander, Quorum delegate.

18:38.201 --> 18:41.119
A man doesn't carve out a path
like that through life without...

18:41.204 --> 18:45.874
All right, enough of this psychoanalysis.
Let's get back to the job in hand.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.004
Does your father have some
other place he wants to go?

18:51.881 --> 18:53.006
What?

18:56.761 --> 19:00.555
Where the hell did they go?
And why didn't they tell us?

19:22.328 --> 19:23.995
RACETRACK ON RADIO:
Galactica, Racetrack.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.039
We've located the source
of the transponder.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.250
It's Sandman's Viper
all right.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.335
But no Sandman.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.254
Affirmative.
Keep searching.

19:36.551 --> 19:39.511
We're getting radiation
signatures from multiple nukes.

19:39.595 --> 19:44.057
Baseship fragments, other debris
indicative of resurrection technology.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.812
I'm afraid it paints
a pretty clear picture.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.900
They found the hub
and they destroyed it.

19:55.152 --> 19:59.197
Looks like our pilots helped. Question
is, where did they go from here?

19:59.282 --> 20:02.576
Oh, Bill. You are way too close to this.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.953
The President's Baseship
was destroyed.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.830
It's a different Baseship.

20:07.290 --> 20:11.835
We'll search every square inch of this
debris field until we come up with a clue.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.879
What? And leave the rest
of the Fleet back there

20:13.963 --> 20:16.298
with their asses
hanging in the wind?

20:16.382 --> 20:18.800
Detail four Raptors
to stay behind.

20:19.594 --> 20:22.888
They keep searching until
they find something concrete.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.472
Give my order.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.901
WOMAN: Hey, people, listen
up. What are we gonna do here?

20:35.985 --> 20:37.152
They've left 35,000 lives...

20:37.236 --> 20:38.528
ZAREK: All right, everybody.
Gather round, please.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.238
...completely undefended.
Gather round.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.323
Mr. President.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.074
Please, please, please.

20:43.159 --> 20:46.286
I'm sorry, Admiral Adama will not
be coming to answer your questions.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.623
I did learn, however, that they've
contacted the Fleet's captains

20:49.707 --> 20:52.709
to inform them that several of
their ships will be requisitioned

20:52.793 --> 20:56.004
to expand the search for Laura
Roslin and the missing Baseship,

20:56.088 --> 21:00.216
while all tylium shipments will be
diverted to support that mission.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.218
(ALL CLAMORING) But he's
bypassing us completely!

21:02.303 --> 21:05.263
I understand. I understand.
We're doing the best...

21:05.348 --> 21:07.641
I understand. We're trying to
get through communications...

21:07.725 --> 21:08.934
That is unconscionable!

21:09.018 --> 21:10.060
WOMAN: That makes
no sense.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.853
Come on. That is nothing short of...

21:11.938 --> 21:13.438
Capt. Franks?

21:13.856 --> 21:19.110
I was impressed by her gravitas during
her turn as judge in the Baltar trial.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.946
That and her vote, naturally.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.073
Yeah. She's already been
approached to run for office.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.200
No interest in politics.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.786
Sadly, now
she really impresses me.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.664
Gods!

21:30.748 --> 21:32.582
You ever
feed that animal?

21:34.043 --> 21:35.835
Where is he anyway?

21:36.212 --> 21:37.212
(LANCE MEOWS)

21:38.172 --> 21:41.049
Come on, Romo.
Let's put our heads together.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.760
Who would Adama
respect as president?

21:45.054 --> 21:49.516
What does this search
for paragons net us anyway?

21:49.934 --> 21:53.520
Except greater guilt at
our own failings. Or worse.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.314
The idiot's illusion
of the clean slate.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.316
A fresh start.
Whoa! Whoa!

21:58.401 --> 22:00.402
We haven't ruled out
all these names yet.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.446
This one's a loser.
An exercise in futility.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.538
Lawyers.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.544
How is this gonna affect the
President? The break in her treatment.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.629
Assuming no other changes
in her circumstances?

22:19.714 --> 22:20.964
Yes.

22:21.048 --> 22:25.010
Well, doloxan really kicks your ass, so
she actually might feel better at first.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.721
But any break gives the
cancer a chance to regroup,

22:27.805 --> 22:29.681
makes it that much
harder to beat it back.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.766
Plus she's taken a hit
to her immune systems,

22:31.851 --> 22:34.519
so she'll be vulnerable
to infections.

22:35.646 --> 22:36.938
How long?

22:37.523 --> 22:39.607
Well, let's just say that the
sooner you get her back here,

22:39.692 --> 22:41.818
the better her chances are.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.031
And while you're
digesting that,

22:46.574 --> 22:48.074
I have some other news.

22:48.159 --> 22:50.910
I ran some tests
on your Cylon prisoner.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.497
Guess what I found.

22:58.085 --> 23:01.087
Raptors are due
back in a few hours.

23:01.172 --> 23:05.717
Granted, if they'd found anything,
we would have heard from them by now.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.635
Still, once we correlate
their reports...

23:07.720 --> 23:09.637
I'm not interested

23:09.972 --> 23:12.390
in the search.
You're not?

23:12.475 --> 23:16.728
I know that you've been spending a
lot of time interrogating the Six,

23:19.482 --> 23:23.651
but now the brig guards tell me
that every time you order them out.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.112
And you turn
off the cameras.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.948
I'm not torturing her, if
that's what you're worried about.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.325
I'm not.

That I could almost
understand. This I can't.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.000

she's pregnant.

been thinking here, Colonel?

23:45.674 --> 23:47.217

have you told this thing?

that? Question my loyalty?

more than your loyalty.

are you doing here?

Writs of forfeiture for
the ships you're borrowing.

27:21.890 --> 27:26.644
The captains want to be absolved of any
blame should anything untoward happen.

One of the less ennobling
consequences of a legal culture.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.735
No one wants
responsibility.

27:36.655 --> 27:40.116
Lee said you once gave him
something before a mission.

A lighter, was it?

27:45.289 --> 27:47.165

27:47.750 --> 27:51.294
Foolish to think a hunk of
metal could keep him safe.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.630
And yet, that's
what we do, isn't it?

27:54.715 --> 27:59.761
Hang on to hope, in every hopelessly
irrational way that we can.

28:01.430 --> 28:05.266
But not like those poor
bastards, giving away their luck,

28:05.351 --> 28:07.477
just when they
need it most.

28:08.062 --> 28:10.188
It's like they've given up.

28:12.608 --> 28:16.736
If you've never been in combat, you
have no idea what they're thinking.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.947
I always imagined
you a realist, Admiral,

28:20.032 --> 28:23.826

hope at the cost of lives.

has his limits.

loses its specific value,

a point, Counselor.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.337
Experience.

30:41.548 --> 30:45.176
When the wrong choices cost
lives and the right ones save,

30:45.260 --> 30:46.886
it's all harder.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.519
We might as well
spell out one name.

30:54.603 --> 30:55.937
(HISSING)

30:58.899 --> 31:00.274
Just one.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.612
One we knew from the start.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.163
Sometimes you take
on a losing case

31:15.123 --> 31:17.542
and you make
yourself a believer.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.836
Other times, no matter
what you tell yourself,

31:26.426 --> 31:30.429
in your heart you know
the outcome is fixed,

31:32.474 --> 31:34.600
and the verdict inevitable.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.896
Lance, defense rests.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.318
Come on.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.288
Apologies.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.415
I couldn't wait
to tell you.

31:57.499 --> 31:58.457
Tell me what?

31:58.542 --> 32:00.293
We found our candidate.

32:00.377 --> 32:03.254
Someone the Quorum
won't hesitate to approve,

32:03.338 --> 32:05.047
even over
Zarek's objections.

32:05.132 --> 32:08.593
Someone the Admiral
can't help but accept.

32:10.012 --> 32:11.345
Yeah? Who?

32:13.682 --> 32:15.975
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.604
My name was
never on that list.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.523
Of course not!
That would be too blatant.

32:23.358 --> 32:27.111
But it is everything you
always wanted, isn't it?

32:27.821 --> 32:30.698
Why you had me cross
47 names off that list.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.201
Come on, admit it.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.039
Savor your victory,
Mr. Adama,

32:39.082 --> 32:42.043
'cause you'll never
get the chance to serve.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.509
What are you doing?
Why?

32:50.594 --> 32:53.179
'Cause you're perfect
for the job, of course.

32:53.263 --> 32:56.515
'Cause after the vicious aberration
that was Baltar's presidency,

32:56.600 --> 32:59.644
and the bitter disappointment
that was Roslin's,

32:59.728 --> 33:04.065
you are a shining
beacon of hope.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.901
Only hope is the last thing we need.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.569
We're a doomed race,

33:08.654 --> 33:11.822
and it's time that we made our
peace with that essential truth.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.449
Romo, what the hell
are you talking about?

33:13.533 --> 33:15.910
Why? You wanna know why?

33:17.079 --> 33:18.371
Open it!

33:23.794 --> 33:26.253
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)

33:29.257 --> 33:30.716
That's right.

33:30.801 --> 33:32.176
They killed my cat!

33:32.260 --> 33:33.302
"They"?

33:33.387 --> 33:36.681
They! Those debased dregs
of humanity out there!

33:36.765 --> 33:41.894
Our lost tribe in search of a new
home so they can roost and rot again.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.646
Romo, how long has
the cat been dead?

33:43.730 --> 33:48.609
How long? It's irrelevant, it's
immaterial, since it wasn't even my cat!

33:48.694 --> 33:51.153
Romo. It's been
dead for weeks.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.738
It belonged to my wife.

33:53.323 --> 33:55.408
I just retrieved him
from a vet on Gemenon.

33:55.492 --> 34:00.788
When the bombs started to fall,
and fate presented me with a choice,

34:01.456 --> 34:03.791
I could get back
on that shuttle

34:05.460 --> 34:09.130
or I could run home
and try to save my family.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.593
How do you think I chose?
Romo.

34:14.678 --> 34:17.471
We've all had to make difficult
choices. You don't think I know?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.724
Your wife's name was Faye.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.560
You had two daughters,
Jennifer and Katie!

34:22.644 --> 34:25.354
They were over 200 passengers
on that shuttle,

34:25.439 --> 34:27.982
only a handful chose
to stay behind.

34:29.276 --> 34:30.568
Yeah. That's right,
it was in your file

34:30.652 --> 34:33.612
when you were handed the job
as Baltar's counsel.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.906
But no one blamed you, Romo,

34:35.991 --> 34:38.784
because at a certain point,
we all made decisions

34:38.869 --> 34:41.787
that saved our lives
at the cost of others.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.166
You think
you're unique, Romo?

34:45.667 --> 34:47.418
Think you're sins
are so special?

34:47.502 --> 34:49.295
Is that it, Counselor?

34:49.629 --> 34:54.383
You're gonna rest your entire case on
that pathetic little bit of insight?

34:55.051 --> 34:57.178
No. Unless...

34:58.597 --> 35:00.264
The clean slate.
The fresh start.

35:00.348 --> 35:03.100
Maybe they are illusions,
like you said.

35:03.894 --> 35:08.439
But at a certain point,
faith in ourselves,

35:08.523 --> 35:11.817
in our right to survive
as a species, as a people,

35:12.527 --> 35:15.696
that's not a given,
that's a choice.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.826
Well, I've made mine.
And if you can't stomach that,

35:20.911 --> 35:23.871
then you had damn well better
squeeze that trigger right now.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.164
Go on.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.542
What are you waiting for?

35:31.004 --> 35:32.963
Or you can make a choice,

35:34.257 --> 35:37.843
put your past behind you,
put the gun down

35:39.638 --> 35:42.973
and help me,
because I'm telling you,

35:43.975 --> 35:46.268
I'm gonna make a
difference in this Fleet.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.604
Is that your final word?

35:48.688 --> 35:49.814
That's up to you.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.818
Then swear it.

35:55.237 --> 36:00.574
I, Leland Joseph Adama,
do now avow and affirm...

36:01.660 --> 36:06.121
...that I take the office of
President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol

36:06.873 --> 36:10.167
without any moral
reservation or mental evasion.

36:10.252 --> 36:14.505
APOLLO ON RADIO:... that I take the office
of President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol

36:14.589 --> 36:17.842
without any moral
reservation or mental evasion.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.930
This is a frakking joke.

36:24.474 --> 36:27.935
You're the only man I can
trust to command this ship.

36:28.645 --> 36:31.021
Well, maybe you're crazy enough
to pull a stunt like this,

36:31.106 --> 36:34.483
but you can't be crazy
enough to leave me in charge.

36:34.568 --> 36:38.904
In case you forgot, my last term
at the helm was a complete disaster.

36:38.989 --> 36:42.700
That was a long time ago.
You're not the same man you were.

36:44.327 --> 36:48.080
You're not even the same man
who came back from New Caprica.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.501
You've found out
a lot about yourself,

36:52.586 --> 36:55.796
been tested in ways I can
barely begin to imagine.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.631
You're ready.

36:58.717 --> 37:02.803
Besides, don't count
on this being permanent.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.598
What if it is?

37:08.310 --> 37:09.810
Put these on.

37:11.438 --> 37:15.816
Then you lead the people to
Earth the best way you can.

37:16.526 --> 37:19.445
The Fleet has stayed here
too long already.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.072
Any other last orders?

37:23.283 --> 37:24.575
Just one.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.246
Give Athena back
her daughter.

37:29.331 --> 37:32.291
She needs her family.
We all need our family.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.337
Take care of this one.

38:14.584 --> 38:17.336
All right, let me see the changes
before you get this out to the press.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.338
All right.
Thank you.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.423
Mr. Lampkin.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.260
Romo.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.556
One day in office, and you've
already got a First Pet.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.977
But Jake here is a genuine
hero of the resistance.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.103
Aren't you, Jake?

38:34.187 --> 38:37.982
Unfortunately, his previous
owners had to let him go.

38:38.858 --> 38:42.027
Jake, meet Romo.
Romo, meet Jake.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.408
Your new best friend.

38:47.492 --> 38:50.619
There's one thing I hate
more than cats. It's dogs.

38:50.704 --> 38:54.999
See, a new pet for you to loathe.
I knew it would be the perfect gift.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.043
Good luck, Jake.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.128
(BARKS)

39:02.716 --> 39:05.676
I hear you're keeping
Zarek as vice president.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.594
I can use the advice.

39:08.263 --> 39:12.516
And as long as he knows he's
heard, I think I can trust him.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.020
I don't know if I agree
with your thinking, but...

39:16.104 --> 39:19.064
Well, I could say
the same thing about yours.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.402
The only difference is,
you're gonna be President,

39:23.486 --> 39:25.612
I'm just getting
in a plane.

39:26.281 --> 39:29.199
Waiting alone in a Raptor, while
the rest of the Fleet jumps away,

39:29.284 --> 39:31.785
that's not just
getting in a plane.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.329
That sounds a lot like...

39:34.748 --> 39:36.874
Well, that sounds
a lot like suicide, Dad.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.835
At least this time I'm
only risking my own neck.

39:39.919 --> 39:44.339
So I guess it won't matter if, as
President, I order you not to do this?

39:46.968 --> 39:53.057
I don't know if I ever told you this, but
one of my first missions was a solo recon,

39:53.808 --> 39:57.436
me alone in a Raptor
in enemy space.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.730
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I was scared.

39:59.814 --> 40:04.234
Told myself that I was doing my
duty, and ultimately I faced my fear.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.988
That's a good memory.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.075
Why are you doing this?

40:11.159 --> 40:12.993
Because I can't
live without her.

40:15.455 --> 40:18.373
And Laura is gonna get
to the rendezvous point.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.417
I have to believe that.

40:37.227 --> 40:38.977
Admiral.
Admiral.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.148
What do you hear,
Starbuck?

40:43.233 --> 40:44.858
Nothing but the rain, sir.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.820
Grab your gun
and bring the cat in.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.029
Yes, sir.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.365
Keep a light on.
I'll be back.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.535
You can count on it.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.148
(HUMMING)

41:54.888 --> 41:57.264
Galactica, this is
Husker. I'm in position.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.057
Affirmative, Husker.

42:02.979 --> 42:06.064
All Fleet ships,
this is Galactica actual.
