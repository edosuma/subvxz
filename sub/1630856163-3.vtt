00:15.765 --> 00:18.184
Rubbing shoulders
with the founder of bitcoin.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.102
- Watch your step, bro.
- On her tab!

00:21.479 --> 00:24.565
Oh, shit! As you were, soldier.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.109
Yo. You fucked up, man.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.486
Fuck you.

00:28.570 --> 00:32.114
No. Fuck you. She was hot.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.491
She was fine.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.745
Like, six and a half, seven in the dark.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.205
You turning down sevens now?

00:39.289 --> 00:42.125
Excuse me, Mr. Clooney.

00:42.709 --> 00:46.295
- Come on, man.
- Fuck, she was hot, wasn't she, bro?

00:46.379 --> 00:48.214
Duh-fucking-uh.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.300
Oh, fuck, man.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.803
Okay, we're gonna go back in

00:53.887 --> 00:57.515
and then you
are gonna play nice with her friend.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.308
- No, fuck that.
- Yeah.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.227
I'm not getting with that Sasquatch.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.856
Whoa! Hey. You owe me for Tahoe, bro.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.609
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.821
Hey, I'm just trying to get
this night back on track, okay?

01:11.905 --> 01:14.448
Look, couple drinks, some laughs,

01:14.532 --> 01:19.578
so before, you know it it'll be
"One, two, I unbuckle her shoe."

01:19.662 --> 01:23.500
"Three, four,
she shoves my fat dick right in the--"

01:24.292 --> 01:25.210
Shit.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.588
What the fuck?

01:30.548 --> 01:31.632
Did you hit someone?

01:31.716 --> 01:34.218
- What? Of course not.
- I just got off with Langdon.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.595
Things have gotten noisy,
we need to tighten up.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.973
- Can I just drive?
- I don't know, can you?

01:39.891 --> 01:41.100
Slow down.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.602
We got till 9:00 a.m.,
we're on a ticking clock.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.521
But I don't want Litvin to spot us.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.941
He will, when I rip him from his car
and beat the crap out of him.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.735
You're not beating anyone.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.862
Last time you did, a witness got killed.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.447
We're in surveillance mode.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.199
With Koslov out of play,
Litvin is in charge of the bomb.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.618
If he doesn't know we're watching,
he'll lead us to it.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.328
Or send us on a wild goose chase

02:01.412 --> 02:03.664
for the next six hours
till the nuke goes off.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.082
Yung, how's it going?

02:05.166 --> 02:06.500
<i>I have a visual.</i>

02:06.584 --> 02:09.879
The target is a black SUV
Northbound on Interstate 15.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.966
<i>He's about five klicks ahead of you,
keeping a steady pace.</i>

02:19.055 --> 02:20.890
- Yes?
- <i>You owe me a package.</i>

02:21.641 --> 02:25.478
The delivery will be made,
but the schedule has changed.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.563
<i>I'm not the kind of man you jerk around.</i>

02:27.647 --> 02:31.525
<i>I can be a real son of a bitch
when I'm unhappy.</i>

02:31.609 --> 02:35.112
I'm not the kind of man
who cowers from empty threats.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.740
<i>The only thing running
on empty is my patience.</i>

02:37.824 --> 02:39.241
<i>I am on a strict timeline.</i>

02:39.325 --> 02:42.286
<i>I have to make this go kaboom tonight.</i>

02:42.370 --> 02:45.581
<i>Tell Koslov, if he doesn't get me
my bomb in the next 30 minutes,</i>

02:45.665 --> 02:48.042
<i>he won't like what happens next.</i>

02:48.126 --> 02:51.879
The schedule has changed.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.049
<i>Then you leave me no choice.</i>

03:06.936 --> 03:08.771
Hey, you got any food?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.482
Chocolate bar? Licorice?
A fucking Tic Tac?

03:11.566 --> 03:14.944
Sorry, no.
Look, I'm fucking starving, too.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.821
I'd kill all of you for quesarito.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.532
Quesarito.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.658
Any luck?

03:21.451 --> 03:24.870
These are all the potential buyers
in the market for a nuclear weapon

03:24.954 --> 03:29.166
so if anyone seems remotely familiar,
it'll help us figure the Russians' plans.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.210
Sorry, I go to a lot of parties.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.713
I meet a lot of people,
it all just kind of, like, blurs.

03:34.797 --> 03:38.884
And also doesn't help that
all these guys are extremely un-fuckable.

03:38.968 --> 03:42.138
That's kind of a biggie
on whether or not I'll remember someone.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.307
I'll probably remember three of you guys.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.725
- Just do your best.
- Okay.

03:46.809 --> 03:47.768
Maya, did you run--

03:47.852 --> 03:51.147
A crosscheck of the NSA database
to see if Litvin's ever been arrested?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.482
Yeah, obviously.

03:53.524 --> 03:57.695
And if I found something I would've
told you because I'm not a sneaky bitch.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.325
What happened to I don't shit where I eat?

04:03.409 --> 04:04.410
It was the ecstasy.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.163
No. Bullshit.
There were plenty of women at the party.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.998
You could have fucked anyone.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.500
But you had to fuck Winters.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.170
It was like a hate-fuck situation, okay?

04:14.712 --> 04:16.380
I thought I'd never see her again.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.300
Take down the target, move on.
That's how we roll, right?

04:19.384 --> 04:20.843
- Right.
- Let's talk.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.305
We already had our talk
and you were right,

04:24.389 --> 04:29.060
I am an American hero,
so I can do any fucking thing I want.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.952
Wish I could be there tonight, sweetheart.

04:49.038 --> 04:49.914
What the...

04:50.957 --> 04:52.208
Who is this dipshit?

04:53.459 --> 04:55.711
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.380
- <i>Why, what's your guy doing now?</i>
- Oh! Uh...

04:58.464 --> 05:01.592
They're off the 15 now,
heading East on Carson Avenue.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.761
Wait, he's pulling over.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.096
<i>You're only two klicks behind him now.</i>

05:12.770 --> 05:14.439
You want us to come?

05:15.565 --> 05:18.985
No. Stay here and keep your eyes open.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.363
Litvin's heading to Fremont Street.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.200
Alone.

05:28.619 --> 05:31.331
Pull over here.
He's a block north, heading west.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.630
There he is.
Shitty blazer, 20 yards up.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.049
We've got Litvin.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.969
- Leave the heavy artillery, sidearms only.
- Got it.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.555
Can't afford
to attract any more attention.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.015
Let's move.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.810
The fuck you looking at me for?

05:52.894 --> 05:54.145
<i>♪ Drop that low ♪</i>

05:54.270 --> 05:56.063
<i>♪ I ain't come lonely, once on me ♪</i>

05:57.231 --> 05:58.232
<i>♪ Drop that low ♪</i>

05:58.316 --> 06:00.443
<i>♪ But you scared that,
don't want from me ♪</i>

06:00.777 --> 06:01.777
<i>♪ Drop that low ♪</i>

06:01.861 --> 06:04.113
<i>♪ We get back, I hate no gummy ♪</i>

06:04.947 --> 06:06.031
<i>♪ I see you baby ♪</i>

06:06.115 --> 06:07.950
<i>♪ Ribs out, drop that low ♪</i>

06:09.494 --> 06:11.286
<i>♪ Like this money on the flow ♪</i>

06:11.370 --> 06:13.247
<i>♪ Drop it like is half of the stone ♪</i>

06:13.331 --> 06:15.249
<i>♪ Just make sure you pick it up slow ♪</i>

06:16.042 --> 06:18.711
Dot's still moving heading Northwest.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.213
I wish my dot would move.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.799
How long does it take
to put nine quesaritos,

06:23.883 --> 06:27.929
five Crunchwrap Supremes,
four Nachos BellGrande in a fucking bag?

06:31.140 --> 06:34.351
I got eyes on the douchebag
headed toward the Four Queens Casino.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.395
Keep your pace.
We don't want to spook him.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.947
Okay, he's going in.
We still just watching?

06:47.031 --> 06:49.367
Affirmative. Move in, but don't engage.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.714
Fuck. This whole place
is a sensory overload.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.393
My eleven o'clock.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.729
Assume he knows our faces,
keep your distance.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.106
All right, spread out.

07:21.524 --> 07:25.402
Remember, this is the guy
threatening to nuke Las Vegas.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.781
He's here for a reason,
do not take your eyes off of him.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.576
Lerner, can you access the cameras?

07:33.119 --> 07:35.997
Casino security is a fickle bitch.
I'll try through a back door.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.375
I knew a girl like that in high school.
Good luck.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.552
What's he looking at?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.681
Directions.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.975
Back on the move,
heading toward the food court.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.227
My man.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.939
<i>Trunk, stay by the ATM's.
Gomez, you take the slot machines.</i>

08:02.023 --> 08:03.941
<i>I'm going to head to the craps tables,</i>

08:04.025 --> 08:06.652
<i>should have a good view
of the food court from there.</i>

08:19.290 --> 08:21.041
Maya, can you unblock my number?

08:21.125 --> 08:24.044
I'm sending you a photo
of the lady working the noodle counter.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.337
Fine.

08:25.421 --> 08:29.425
- You think this is an exchange?
- Yeah, an exchange of cash for noodles.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.719
Probably. It's called due diligence.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.388
No stone unturned.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.433
You want me get a slice from Sbarro,
get a closer look?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.560
I can get a whole pie
of whatever is better.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.270
Stay put.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.438
Maya, how we doing?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.314
No dice on the cameras,

08:44.398 --> 08:46.651
but facial recognition
got a hit on the noodle girl.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.485
And?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.737
<i>And McKnight was right,
she's a noodle girl.</i>

08:50.821 --> 08:51.655
Thanks, Maya.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.031
You were wrong, Ava.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.784
Thank you, Maya.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.161
I don't care if you approve.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.121
That guy looks 28 years old.

09:00.915 --> 09:01.999
Fine, fine.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.835
Is she home yet? I want to say hi.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.131
Away for the weekend? She's 18.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.426
Okay, okay. Where did they go?

09:14.554 --> 09:15.888
Las Vegas?

09:18.474 --> 09:20.058
<i>How're we doing, McKnight?</i>

09:20.142 --> 09:22.060
I've got a good look at him here.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.313
I'm going to blend in keep my eye on him.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.522
New roller.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.484
<i>Remember surveillance mode,
just keep it cool.</i>

09:28.568 --> 09:30.527
Don't worry, I got this.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.528
Give me 12.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.363
Tell me you didn't bet the 12.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.073
What's wrong with 12?

09:35.157 --> 09:36.366
It's a sucker bet.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.994
Your odds are 35 to 1
but the payouts only 30 to 1.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.413
You might as well
throw your money in a toilet.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.332
It's the highest number.
I'm sticking with it.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.878
Eight the Hard Way.
The point is eight.

09:47.962 --> 09:48.921
What happened?

09:49.005 --> 09:50.131
You lost your money.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.507
Shit.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.009
How much do you have left?

09:54.677 --> 09:55.636
Thirty-one dollars.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.180
- What? Really?
- That's not a lot of money.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.600
- Did you not get your allowance this week?
- I don't carry cash on a mish.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.352
Hey, guys, remember the nuke?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.688
Relax. Litvin's still hoovering noodles.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.607
<i>Here's what we'll do...
the point eight.</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:11.235
<i>Five dollars on the pass line,
25 odds behind.</i>

10:11.319 --> 10:12.319
<i>You roll an 8 before a 7,</i>

10:12.403 --> 10:14.196
we can build bankroll
and ride till morning.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.490
- You ready to mount up?
- Yes, ma'am.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.867
Can I put my last dollar on 12?

10:18.951 --> 10:20.410
You do and I'll break your dick.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.791
Eight. Winner.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.335
Holy shit, Tech Chick.
You fucking nailed it!

10:28.419 --> 10:29.920
That's what I'm talking about!

10:30.004 --> 10:31.172
Ow!

10:31.756 --> 10:35.343
All right, now we got some juice,
it's time to come.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.804
<i>That came out wrong.
I meant we're gonna bet the come...</i>

10:43.351 --> 10:44.185
Buy you a drink?

10:45.186 --> 10:46.979
No, thank you. I got one.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.690
You know the boys and I
are in town for tile expo.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.278
I'm in the sandstone game.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.239
None of that ceramics bullshit.
Excuse my French.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.491
Hmm.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.329
You been working here long?

11:04.538 --> 11:05.581
Oh!

11:05.665 --> 11:06.748
I don't work here.

11:06.832 --> 11:11.003
Right, you're not working,
I'm not a customer.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.757
We're just a couple people at a bar,
having a couple drinks.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.676
Settling on a price.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.889
Okay. I'm not working like that.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.891
No, of course not.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.895
You're just
in a little black dress at a casino bar,

11:28.479 --> 11:31.565
scanning older men for no reason.

11:31.649 --> 11:35.027
If you don't leave right now,
I'm going to yell rape or pedophile.

11:35.111 --> 11:35.986
Pick your choice.

11:36.070 --> 11:40.741
You know, maybe don't stand
at the stove wearing a chef's hat,

11:40.825 --> 11:42.576
people are going to expect omelets.

11:45.996 --> 11:49.291
- What the fuck is happening?
- <i>You know what they say?</i>

11:49.375 --> 11:52.669
If it walks like a slut
and quacks like a slut--

11:52.753 --> 11:56.465
Okay, you know what, Maya?
I am so done with your...

11:58.426 --> 12:00.928
Shit, I lost visual.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.598
He's re-saucing.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.226
It's not sriracha, could be oyster.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.061
<i>Maybe dark soy.</i>

12:10.354 --> 12:12.731
What you want to do
is add a little bit of both.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.567
Add some toasted sesame.

12:15.651 --> 12:19.404
You never want to overwhelm it
with a singular flavor profile.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.908
<i>Paul, this may take a minute.
Stay and keep an eye on that vehicle.</i>

12:22.992 --> 12:23.825
Copy.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.119
<i>Autopilot activated.</i>

12:26.203 --> 12:28.455
<i>Hey, it's Jen. Don't leave a message.</i>

12:28.539 --> 12:29.832
Jen, it's Dad again.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.961
I'm not mad,
I just need you to call me back.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.463
It's about Vegas.

12:36.046 --> 12:39.966
You can't come here,
just stay away from Vegas.

12:40.050 --> 12:43.470
Let's go up on a hard four,
max bet across the board,

12:43.554 --> 12:45.514
and let's throw a hundo on the field

12:45.598 --> 12:48.767
and let's hop on the five
just for the shits.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.603
You're making a hot bet
just to fuck with me right?

12:51.687 --> 12:54.106
Just making sure
you're still with me, Lady Luck.

12:59.695 --> 13:00.529
Ugh!

13:01.197 --> 13:02.072
Oh!

13:04.366 --> 13:06.451
I'm not sitting back there in that stink.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.161
I'm doing government business.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.205
So was I, but now I'm bored.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.916
Ugh. I can't even get on TikTok.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.880
Here, TikTok to your heart's content.

13:18.964 --> 13:19.798
Thank you.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.509
- <i>Point nine winner.</i>
- Yes!

13:22.593 --> 13:24.428
Shit! I told you, Carl!

13:24.512 --> 13:26.972
I told you, motherfucker.
I fuckin' told you.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.769
- USA!
- USA! USA! USA!

13:31.894 --> 13:33.770
All right, slow your roll, McKnight,

13:33.854 --> 13:35.730
you're attracting a lot of attention.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.483
This is what happens at a casino, Winters.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.319
People win, they get happy.
It's the American dream.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.320
Noodles in the trash.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.656
Looks like he left
a bunch of good bites, too.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.324
What now? We watched the guy eat,

13:46.408 --> 13:48.452
you want to make bets
whether he gets a drink?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.620
Target on the move towards the elevators.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.790
McKnight and I will follow,
you guys stay here.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.458
Stay here?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.085
You're my best eye.
I need you looking for surprises.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.796
<i>Trunk, in tighter quarters,
you're harder to hide.</i>

13:59.880 --> 14:02.382
That's okay.
You don't have to hide anything from us.

14:02.466 --> 14:05.802
It's fine. I'll watch the doors.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.847
Hey, watch my chips.
I gotta go save the world real quick.

14:08.931 --> 14:09.765
Ladies!

14:18.857 --> 14:21.318
Slow down. We're getting too close.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.089
What, uh... What floor are you?

14:45.843 --> 14:47.595
Okey-dokey.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.389
I guess he's got it covered.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.143
Damn it.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.980
Which floor are you again?

14:59.064 --> 15:01.107
Um, eight? No. Maybe twelve.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.611
- It's got to be one of these.
- God damn it.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.237
It's all good.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.072
Our one eared man won't get away.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.826
Our girls are like white on rice,
right, Lady Luck?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.077
<i>Sure thing.</i>

15:12.828 --> 15:14.455
You know I always got your back.

15:15.039 --> 15:15.998
Get it, girl.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.588
Litvin just got off the elevator.
He's on the 19th floor.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.049
Get the fuck out.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.177
Jesus Christ,
we're only on the second floor.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.011
Should we take the stairs?

15:30.095 --> 15:33.014
Running up 17 flights?
That won't get us there any faster.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.099
Fuck.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.819
<i>Litvin is at the end of the hall.</i>

15:50.115 --> 15:50.949
Fuck it.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.326
Are you serious?

15:59.333 --> 16:00.751
Come on!

16:01.961 --> 16:03.629
<i>Litvin is entering a room.</i>

16:11.220 --> 16:12.596
What's the password, bitch?

16:15.265 --> 16:17.601
Bobby, quit busting balls.
Let him in.

16:23.649 --> 16:28.445
<i>- ♪ Oh, Mamy, oh, Mamy, Mamy Blue ♪
- ♪ Oh, Mamy ♪</i>

16:28.529 --> 16:30.906
<i>♪ Oh, Mamy Blue ♪</i>

16:31.573 --> 16:35.744
<i>- ♪ I may be your forgotten son ♪
- ♪ Oh, Mamy... ♪</i>

16:35.828 --> 16:37.120
Sorry about that.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.080
Bobby saw Dom Irrera at the Orleans,

16:39.164 --> 16:40.707
now he thinks he's a comedian.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.001
Anyway, you made it right on time.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.461
At 2:30 on the dot.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.046
I'm always on time.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.798
And I told you to come alone.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.509
Hey, we all need backup
just in case, right?

16:51.593 --> 16:54.054
Don't mind Tracy,
it's like she's not even here.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.640
The world disappears
when she's got her candy to crush.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.309
- What happened to your ear?
- Hey! Manners.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.728
Sorry. Kids today have no respect.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.021
Can I get you something?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.357
I have an untouched Wellington
from Hugo's cellar.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.816
So good you wanna frame it.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.111
You know what I need.
Are you ready or not?

17:09.737 --> 17:11.112
Of course, I'm ready.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.781
Lenny is always ready.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.701
You want drugs?
I get you the purest blow in town.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.120
You want muscle,
I can get you a bus full of guys

17:19.204 --> 17:21.081
that make Bobby look like a teddy bear.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.874
You know I always deliver.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.418
What you're asking for
ain't exactly on the regular menu.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.463
You said you can handle it.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.756
I know what I said, babe,

17:29.840 --> 17:31.841
but if you want me to scratch your back,

17:31.925 --> 17:35.012
I'm going to need some scratch too,
in advance.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.638
Hmm?

17:48.442 --> 17:49.318
Fucking close.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.572
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.658
I shouldn't have had so much champagne.

17:56.742 --> 18:01.789
Or beer. Or tequila. Or vod--

18:07.628 --> 18:09.046
Boot and fucking rally.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.341
Come on. Why the fuck did you stop?

18:12.966 --> 18:16.511
<i>Trunk, keep watching the tracker.
Let us know if he moves.</i>

18:16.595 --> 18:18.722
Large Meat Lovers for Jill.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.518
Hey, guys, I moved to the food court.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.519
It's easier to blend in.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.481
Yeah, easier to blend
into a large pepperoni too.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.860
I'm on 19. Get ready to alert the hotel--

18:31.944 --> 18:34.446
Here. Here. I'm here.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.907
Come on.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.973
Let's move closer,
see if we can hear what's going on.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.601
It's too risky,
if he exits the room we'll be exposed.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.687
We'll see on the tracker
if he goes to the door.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.565
Okay, but we pull out before he comes.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.567
Don't.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.068
I didn't.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.697
But that isn't
my standard operating procedure.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.416
I can't hear anything.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.087
Money's all there.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.547
Terrific.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.300
Sorry about making you
jump through all those hoops.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.761
In this town, you never know
who's being real or not.

19:40.679 --> 19:44.057
Just make sure
the planes are there 8:00 a.m. sharp.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.267
You got it.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.686
You mind telling me
what or who we're carrying?

19:48.770 --> 19:51.231
Don't worry about things
you don't need to.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.650
Ooh! Such a tough guy.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.443
Don't mind her.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.488
She's just mad she's missing
Zendaya's birthday at the Palms

19:58.572 --> 20:00.615
with all the TikTokers and that nonsense.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.117
Anything else I can get you?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.620
How about a vodka Cel-Ray?
Something refreshing, cold.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.748
There is one more thing I want.

20:24.139 --> 20:25.932
What the fuck?

20:37.069 --> 20:38.236
Where is Litvin?

20:38.320 --> 20:41.949
<i>He's gotta be in that room,
you should be right on top of him.</i>

20:45.202 --> 20:47.329
Shit. It's really kicking in again.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.207
Are you guys here for Jeff's fuck-fest?

20:51.291 --> 20:53.710
'Cause you don't look like your photos.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.670
Not that I'm complaining.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.213
Definitely, not complaining.

20:57.297 --> 21:00.217
<i>What's Jeff's fuck-fest?
Where are you guys?</i>

21:02.219 --> 21:05.722
Shit, this is Litvin's phone.
We've been fucking made.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.475
You wanna join in?

21:09.059 --> 21:10.810
McKnight, time to go.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.980
- You want to leave?
- You want to stay?

21:15.732 --> 21:16.900
- Later, Jeff.
- So no?

21:18.443 --> 21:19.278
All right.

21:20.487 --> 21:23.323
Happy Anniversary, sweetheart.

21:28.870 --> 21:29.954
<i>Da.</i>

21:30.038 --> 21:33.291
The meeting was successful
we'll have Ivan back soon

21:33.375 --> 21:35.585
but the Americans have been tailing us.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.420
You go. I'll find my way out.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.422
Understood.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.340
Let's go.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.726
The driver made me.
Litvin's men got back in the car.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.228
<i>They're leaving without him.</i>

21:54.062 --> 21:55.605
- Stay with them.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

21:55.689 --> 21:57.565
How did One-Ear know we're on to him?

21:57.649 --> 22:00.360
- Probably spotted you downstairs.
- That's bullshit.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.446
Maybe you were busy cheating
with your new bestie to notice.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.115
<i>We didn't cheat, we just played the odds.</i>

22:06.199 --> 22:08.327
- Screw this. I'm taking the stairs.
- Again?

22:22.632 --> 22:23.925
Here, let me help.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.391
Someone check the lobby.
Make sure he does not leave.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.352
Copy. I've got the casino.
Trunk, you cover the doors.

22:35.062 --> 22:35.896
Copy.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.315
Is my double meat lovers
with extra jalapenos done yet?

22:39.399 --> 22:40.233
No.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.943
Fuck. Who's the manager?

22:42.027 --> 22:43.528
Who's the... Fuck!

22:46.573 --> 22:50.076
I'm making good time,
going down is a lot easier.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.453
Fuck!

22:52.412 --> 22:53.371
Ow!

22:54.539 --> 22:55.498
Fuck!

22:55.582 --> 22:57.626
<i>McKnight, what happened?</i>

22:58.210 --> 23:00.295
<i>Are you okay?</i>

23:01.171 --> 23:02.047
All good.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.762
<i>I'm stuck in this fucking elevator.</i>

23:09.346 --> 23:11.890
- Ah! Colors.
- <i>Anyone see him?</i>

23:13.016 --> 23:14.809
Uh, I'm... I'm looking.

23:14.893 --> 23:18.605
<i>We cannot let Vlad leave the casino
or we are fucked. Stay vigilant.</i>

23:26.113 --> 23:27.197
Oh, my God.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.492
What are you doing here?

23:31.576 --> 23:34.454
I don't know.
I don't even know where I am.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.497
- I just... I don't want this night to end.
- No.

23:36.581 --> 23:40.793
I've never felt so alive in my life.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.087
Yung, what's going on
with the Russians' vehicle?

23:43.171 --> 23:46.675
- They're hightailing it out of the city.
- <i>Stay on 'em.</i>

23:47.384 --> 23:48.593
<i>Trunk, you got anything?</i>

23:49.136 --> 23:50.387
Yeah, no signs of Litvin.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.517
Who's this?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.895
It's Charlie, from Postmates.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.315
I got your Taco Bell order
and I am at the address.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.609
I had to move,
I'm at the Four Queens Casino.

24:06.278 --> 24:10.782
We're not supposed to go to a new address
after the order's already been picked up.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.034
Okay, I'll give you a bigger tip.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.748
Are you eating my nachos del grande?

24:20.417 --> 24:22.543
Sorry, you're breaking up.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.212
I can't hear you.

24:25.630 --> 24:29.967
I can't believe I was gonna settle down
to boring town with boring Billy.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.386
I...

24:31.970 --> 24:33.555
You turn something on me.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.099
You turn a lot of things on in me.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.267
Um, but you know, you saw the videos.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.269
There... There was more than one video?

24:40.353 --> 24:42.563
Yeah, there were seven.
You didn't get them?

24:42.647 --> 24:44.148
No, I want--

24:44.232 --> 24:47.694
- Let me airdrop them to you.
- Yeah, airdrop them, yeah.

24:52.407 --> 24:55.409
You want to get a room
and pick up where we left off?

24:55.493 --> 24:58.121
Believe me, I want to more than anything,

24:59.331 --> 25:00.915
but I really can't right now.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.000
- Why not?
- Because I'm working.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.003
Then why are you rubbing my pussy?

25:07.672 --> 25:09.132
Oh! Oh!

25:14.304 --> 25:15.638
Fuck.

25:15.722 --> 25:20.644
It's just you and the molly,
it's like the ultimate combination.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.646
No, but seriously, I gotta go.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.565
- Yeah, I'll call you.
- Mmm...

25:28.860 --> 25:30.778
Get your ass to the Four Queens Casino

25:30.862 --> 25:33.114
before I drop zero stars on you.
You get me?

25:33.698 --> 25:36.451
Jeez, all right. I'm coming, I'm coming.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.833
I looked all around the casino.
He's not there.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.378
<i>He must've gotten outside
but can't be far.</i>

25:47.212 --> 25:48.797
<i>Search Fremont high and low.</i>

25:49.589 --> 25:51.132
You stay low, I'll go high.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.844
Lerner, pull the CCTV footage
on Fremont Street.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.096
I need eyes everywhere.

25:57.055 --> 25:57.889
Hey!

25:57.973 --> 26:01.184
Sorry, I need a screen that's bigger
than a freakin' playing card.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.476
My laptop, for instance.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.229
Why don't you get over yourself
and hurry the fuck up?

26:05.313 --> 26:06.314
Sorry. Not you.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.192
I'm in.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.402
<i>Run an ocular scan of everyone leaving.</i>

26:11.486 --> 26:12.528
Oh!

26:14.114 --> 26:15.781
Elevator's full. Take the next one.

26:15.865 --> 26:17.033
Looks like there's room.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.286
Take the fucking next one!

26:20.578 --> 26:23.748
- <i>Still got eyes on that vehicle?</i>
- Affirmative. I'm on him.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.542
Oh, you're on him, all right.

26:26.626 --> 26:31.130
Just like your daughter's
on that sleaze-bag slippery hog.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.216
When you picture it, is he circumcised?

26:33.300 --> 26:36.594
Because I've got an image in my head
and, buddy, it's not pretty.

26:41.558 --> 26:44.227
- Where'd he go?
- <i>Yung, what's going on up there?</i>

26:45.478 --> 26:46.854
<i>Paul, what's happening?</i>

26:46.938 --> 26:49.690
I... don't know.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.319
<i>Just stay glued to that SUV.</i>

26:54.195 --> 26:56.781
Shit, I lost them.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.116
Son of a bitch.

26:58.616 --> 26:59.951
Get the Vulture back here.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.620
Fuck. Fuck.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.876
- Sorry, guys.
- Where's this shithead?

27:10.086 --> 27:12.172
Fuck. Litvin ditched his jacket.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.715
He's altering his appearance. Anything?

27:14.799 --> 27:16.050
Pockets are empty.

27:16.134 --> 27:19.303
Jacket's giving us nothing
except it's softer than anything

27:19.387 --> 27:20.597
a man should ever wear.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.431
Shit.

27:22.515 --> 27:23.891
My God, it's incredible.

27:27.812 --> 27:28.980
Oh, my God.

27:29.064 --> 27:29.981
What?

27:30.065 --> 27:31.483
That's more than a fart.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.777
Hagerty just shit his pants.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.570
Smell in here's a special kind of awful.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.197
What about the fucking scan?

27:38.281 --> 27:39.865
The rodeo just let out,

27:39.949 --> 27:42.618
there's tons of cowboy hats
obscuring people's faces.

27:42.702 --> 27:44.203
Okay, I can't stay on this bus.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.162
No, no.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.164
Check everyone with a cowboy hat.

27:54.714 --> 27:57.591
Fuck. No sign of him. Gomez?

28:11.106 --> 28:13.691
I see Litvin,
he's headed toward the East exit.

28:13.775 --> 28:14.775
Everyone get there now.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.736
Move! Move, move, move.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.058
I have the target on my sight.
What do you want me to do?

28:47.142 --> 28:48.810
Shoot to stop, not to kill.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.478
Aim for the kneecaps.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.081
Fuck. I missed.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.625
What? You never miss.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.962
Not the food.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.715
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

29:19.799 --> 29:21.634
What happened?

29:21.718 --> 29:23.219
What does it look like?

29:23.303 --> 29:27.557
My fucking elbow exploded! What the fuck?

29:28.141 --> 29:29.767
I see Litvin. He's getting away.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.727
He's at the end of the street. Shit!

29:31.811 --> 29:33.855
Lerner, use the bus to block his path.

29:34.481 --> 29:35.690
I'm not on the bus.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.067
I mean, I had to right?

29:39.194 --> 29:40.027
Oh!

29:40.111 --> 29:43.281
- <i>Maya, what's going on?</i>
- You don't wanna know what I'm doing.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.453
Oh, shit, he's coming towards me.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.580
- Fucking stop him!
- How?

29:51.664 --> 29:53.917
Do whatever it takes.
It's your time to shine.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.627
Okay.

29:57.378 --> 29:58.213
Stop.

30:03.927 --> 30:04.969
Oh, shit.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.599
No, please, please don't kill me.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.991
Lerner, sit-rep!

30:27.784 --> 30:28.618
He's...

30:29.160 --> 30:30.995
He's being taken off.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.372
- <i>Taken off? By who?</i>
- I don't know.

30:33.456 --> 30:34.290
<i>Fuck!</i>

30:39.170 --> 30:40.463
You okay?

30:40.547 --> 30:41.547
What happened?

30:41.631 --> 30:46.302
This guy came out of nowhere,
he had a cattle prod and took off in limo.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.097
- Did you get a license plate?
- It was black.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.559
Yung, we're looking
for a black limo, just left the area.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.229
<i>Yung, are you with us?</i>

30:57.313 --> 30:59.482
<i>Black limo, do you see it?</i>

30:59.566 --> 31:01.526
Yeah. I see a black limo.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.654
And another and another and another.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.572
Of course.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.657
The douchebags-in-limos
capital of the world.

31:08.741 --> 31:12.411
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Yeah, but I've never his face before.

31:12.495 --> 31:13.788
I have.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.292
Ivan had to make a stop once
when I was with him.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.086
He said it was like a business thing
so I waited in the car,

31:21.170 --> 31:23.506
- but that guy was there.
- Where was the meeting?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.049
Some warehouse.

31:25.675 --> 31:28.052
Not sure of the address.
There was a junkyard next to it.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.804
Anything else that narrows it down?

31:30.847 --> 31:34.183
Oh! It was like a graveyard
for old carnival rides.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.644
There was a Ferris wheel, but dead.

31:37.645 --> 31:38.855
I know where that is.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.781
Tell me again about your schedule.

31:50.617 --> 31:53.620
What is so damn important,

31:54.746 --> 31:57.248
that you would upend our agreement

31:57.332 --> 32:01.002
and upset a man of my temperament?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.423
Fuck you.

32:06.674 --> 32:12.013
You know, I don't like it
when you speak Russian.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.306
I can't understand you

32:14.390 --> 32:17.685
and I want us to understand each other.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.521
Wanna help our friend understand?

32:44.504 --> 32:46.297
There's the limo. We got 'em.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.966
We go in quiet.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.558
Find out about that warehouse.
If there's security cams you can hack.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.768
I'm already in.

32:59.268 --> 33:01.437
There are a lot of dudes with guns.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.690
We've got guns too,
and they don't know we're coming.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.323
Hmm.

33:13.074 --> 33:16.035
You are tough. I get it.

33:17.286 --> 33:20.706
The fucked up ear thing, very scary.

33:20.790 --> 33:24.001
You and your boss, very formidable.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.963
But here is the thing that you missed...

33:30.425 --> 33:32.552
I am formidable too.

33:34.470 --> 33:37.181
Ehren, let's show him what I mean.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.878
Psst. Hey, Gomez, let's go.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.988
Now, three things are about to happen,

34:34.072 --> 34:36.282
two of which you can't do shit about.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.285
The third one, that's still up to you.

34:40.244 --> 34:44.581
One, you are going to tell me
where my bomb is.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.292
Two, I am going to take it.

34:47.376 --> 34:50.922
And three, now this is one
that you still have some say in,

34:51.506 --> 34:55.384
Ehren is going to cut off your good ear

34:55.468 --> 34:56.385
just to make sure

34:56.469 --> 35:00.223
that there is no further miscommunication.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.475
Can you hear me now?

35:03.559 --> 35:05.186
Fuck you.

35:08.064 --> 35:08.898
Suit yourself.

35:11.692 --> 35:12.526
Take it.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.244
You hear that?

35:22.161 --> 35:23.954
Shit. Can you pick this lock?

35:24.038 --> 35:27.583
Yeah, but with all due respect,
fuck surveillance mode.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.086
Get him out of here.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.141
Fuck, there are a lot of dudes with guns.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.434
Then we kill them all.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.061
Not Litvin, we need him alive.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.604
Gomez, your left.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.114
Trunk, your three.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.540
Lana, we need to move.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.502
No, shit! I wasn't ready.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.087
I need help out here.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.714
<i>- Lana ran for cover.</i>
- On it.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.969
Winters, cover me up top.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.644
Come here, motherfucker.

36:35.109 --> 36:37.736
I'm kicking your ass
on 12 beers and zero sleep.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.990
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! Fuck you.

36:44.035 --> 36:44.869
Free me.

36:46.704 --> 36:49.706
Got my hands full with Johnny government,
you deaf and blind?

36:49.790 --> 36:53.418
If they take me,
you will never get your bomb.

36:53.502 --> 36:56.296
At least you're calling it my bomb.
We're getting somewhere.

36:58.007 --> 37:01.552
Free me. I will take you to it.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.393
Take your bitch ass to sleep.

37:17.526 --> 37:19.820
It's okay, all right? I got you.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.072
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.615
Stay behind me, okay.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.465
Clear. You good?

37:40.549 --> 37:41.384
Yeah.

37:45.638 --> 37:48.640
- They must have left with Litvin.
- Where are these shitheads?

37:57.316 --> 37:58.276
Get him in!

38:06.534 --> 38:07.994
Trunk! Trunk!

38:10.121 --> 38:12.164
McKnight!

38:13.833 --> 38:16.002
Gomez! Take the shot.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.670
- I can't.
- Take the fucking shot.

38:18.754 --> 38:20.965
It's the fucking molly.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.303
McKnight, we can't risk it.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.471
Fuck.

38:29.932 --> 38:31.851
Hey, come on. Don't do this.

38:32.351 --> 38:33.311
He's still alive.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.938
They wouldn't have taken him if he wasn't.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.440
We're going to get him back.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.442
We're gonna get both of them back.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.944
Paul, land at the bus.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.867
These things have seat belts, right?

38:48.951 --> 38:51.746
Come on, Lerner, let's go. Hurry up.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.670
Fly faster, they have Trunk.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.546
Is someone gonna close the doors?

39:01.630 --> 39:03.424
Paul, how fast are we flying?

39:04.967 --> 39:05.801
Paul!

39:07.178 --> 39:08.470
130 knots.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.806
130 knots headed due east, with winds...

39:11.932 --> 39:13.558
Maya, pull up the map?

39:13.642 --> 39:15.186
You have a vector?

39:17.813 --> 39:20.941
That path will bring them somewhere here,
Lake Las Vegas.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.694
I want to know everything
that's in that grid.

39:27.698 --> 39:31.326
One of the lake houses
have been pulling crazy amounts of energy.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.244
How crazy?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.747
If you were trying
to cool nuclear material.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.874
Pull up satellite images.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.084
On it.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.754
Paul, patch us into air control comms.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.843
What the hell? It's cake?

39:58.938 --> 40:01.064
Mmm, fucking delicious, right?

40:01.148 --> 40:03.442
This ain't no Betty Crocker shit.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.611
Oh, yeah, let me get some.

40:06.445 --> 40:09.197
Oh! This shit's moist as hell!

40:09.281 --> 40:12.451
Ain't nothing like
the sweet taste of chopper. Mmm!

40:12.535 --> 40:16.330
- Do you mind if I have the rest?
- You son of a bitch.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.040
What the fuck are you doing, Paul?

40:18.124 --> 40:20.542
Okay, fine! It's all yours, dick.

40:20.626 --> 40:21.877
You motherfucker!

40:22.378 --> 40:23.963
Are you out of your fucking mind?

40:25.923 --> 40:28.383
He just pulled the fucking stabilizer.

40:28.467 --> 40:29.468
Paul!

40:29.552 --> 40:31.303
Where the fuck are you?

40:33.264 --> 40:36.225
Sir, look. They're going down!

40:36.767 --> 40:38.268
Fuck. Fuck.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.896
Get this fucking thing
under control, Yung!

40:40.980 --> 40:42.814
I don't think I can land it.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.399
Well, I definitely can't!

40:44.483 --> 40:47.194
- Are we gonna crash?
- It's okay, team. It's all right.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.571
- <i>Terrain.</i>
- Everything's gonna be--

40:49.655 --> 40:53.075
- Fuck.
<i>- Pull up. Pull up.</i>

40:55.286 --> 40:56.912
<i>Terrain ahead.</i>

40:56.996 --> 40:58.956
<i>- Pull up.</i>
- Fuck yeah!

40:59.540 --> 41:02.626
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>
