01:55.183 --> 01:57.618
- NO, NO I MEAN,
I REALLY WANT HIS ASS,

01:57.651 --> 02:00.354
INSTEAD OF THIS
TIRED OLD THING.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.656
- YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID YOUR ASS
IS YOUR FINEST FEATURE.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.693
- ONLY LATELY, IT'S LOOKING
A LITTLE...PEAKED.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.296
- YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE IT NEEDS A REST.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.331
- WHAT IT NEEDS...
IS A LIFT.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.433
- YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
FOR PLASTIC SURGERY.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.336
- HEH HEH, THIS LIFE
CAN WEAR YOU OUT

02:15.369 --> 02:17.771
BY THE TIME YOU'RE 30.
RIGHT, BRIAN?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.707
- [chuckles]

02:19.740 --> 02:21.509
- BESIDES, SELF-IMPROVEMENT

IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL
STRIVE FOR,

02:23.344 --> 02:24.778
NOW MATTER WHAT AGE.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.780
- TRUST ME,

02:26.814 --> 02:29.883
GLUTEAL ENHANCEMENT
IS VERY PRICEY.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.652
- MY GOD, TEDDY!

02:31.685 --> 02:33.454
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE HAD WORK DONE.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.256
- YEAH, BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE,
I'D SUE.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.958
- HEH HEH. I'M SPEAKING
IN MY PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY

02:37.991 --> 02:40.261
AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.662
BUTT WORK COSTS BIG BUCKS.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.764
- BIG BUCKS, I DON'T HAVE.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.367
- WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
SELL THAT OLD TIRED ASS

02:46.400 --> 02:47.401
FOR A NEW ONE.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.802

02:50.471 --> 02:53.641
THE MOST FUCKING AMAZING
BLOW JOB.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.808
WANT A BUMP?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.810

LOOKS LIKE FUN, THOUGH.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.246

WITH YOU GUYS?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.913

I CAN STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND
FUCK MY BRAINS OUT LIKE YOU.

- [chuckles]

03:18.766 --> 03:20.368
LET'S DANCE.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.403
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.004
IT'LL TAKE YOUR MIND
OFF THINGS.

03:24.037 --> 03:24.972
- I SAID I DON'T WANT TO.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.775
- WELL, YOU ALWAYS LIKED DANCING
WITH JUSTIN.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.923
[background chatter]

03:42.956 --> 03:45.393
- OKAY, BOYS,
WHAT'LL IT BE?

03:45.426 --> 03:48.529
JESUS CHRIST,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.564
- I'M NOT QUITE SURE,
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS,

03:50.598 --> 03:52.733
MY HEAD FEELS LIKE
THE DANCE FLOOR AT BABYLON.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.368
- YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
WHAT YOU GET FOR STAYING OUT

03:54.402 --> 03:56.537
SUCKIN' AND FUCKIN'

03:56.570 --> 03:57.738
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.507
- I'M NOT IN SCHOOL, MA.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.475
- YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.843
YOU GOTTA A LOT
OF LEARNIN' TO DO.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.412
- BEFORE WE START
THE LECTURE,

04:04.445 --> 04:06.480
COULD I ORDER FIRST,
PLEASE?

04:06.514 --> 04:08.048
- I WANT YOU TO HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY

04:08.081 --> 04:11.619
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH
SO MAYBE YOU'LL DIGEST IT.

04:11.652 --> 04:17.491
GET OVER DAVID, GET A JOB,
AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

04:17.525 --> 04:18.959
NOW...

04:18.992 --> 04:20.694
WHAT'LL IT BE?

04:20.728 --> 04:23.631
- BACON AND EGGS.
EGGS OVER EASY.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.500
VERY, VERY, VERY,
VERY EASY.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.001
- MMM, MAKE IT TWO.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.970
- AND PLENTY OF BLACK COFFEE.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.639
- YOUR MOM'S RIGHT,
SWEETIE.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.541
FOR YOUR OWN DIGNITY,

04:33.574 --> 04:34.875
YOUR OWN SELF-WORTH,

04:34.908 --> 04:37.478
NOT TO MENTION YOUR HALF
OF THE RENT,

04:37.511 --> 04:38.579
YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO WORK.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.947
- DOING WHAT?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.915
- WELL,
THERE'S ALWAYS THE BIG Q.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.952
- HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE CRAP EMPORIUM.

04:44.985 --> 04:48.456
HE NEEDS TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.
SOMETHING DARING,

04:48.489 --> 04:49.457
SOMETHING FABULOUS.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.392
- NO...
FUCK FABULOUS.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.726
HE NEEDS
SOMETHING STEADY,

04:52.760 --> 04:55.596
SOMETHING PRACTICAL,
SOMETHING SECURE.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.064
- LIKE BEING AN ACCOUNTANT?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.666
- HE SHOULD ONLY
BE SO LUCKY.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.534
YEAH, I'VE GOT
A PENSION FUND,

05:00.568 --> 05:02.570
HEALTH PLAN, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
PEACE OF MIND.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.937
I GO TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT

05:03.971 --> 05:05.873
KNOWING THAT IN,
UH, 31 YEARS

05:05.906 --> 05:08.409
WHEN I RETIRE
FROM WERTSHAFTER AND COMPANY,

05:08.442 --> 05:11.512
I CAN MOVE DOWN TO BOCA,
LIVE LIKE A KING.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.980
- OR QUEEN.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.649
- HOW WOULD LIKE YOUR TOAST,
YOUR MAJESTY?

05:15.683 --> 05:18.552
WITH STRAWBERRY JAM OR CAVIAR?
[laughs]

05:18.586 --> 05:20.654
- [groans]

05:20.688 --> 05:23.824
- "ATTACH PART 'J'
TO PART 'K'...

05:23.857 --> 05:26.794
USING A...GRATCHET"?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.363
[scoffing] WHAT THE FUCK
IS A GRATCHET?

05:29.397 --> 05:30.864
- BEATS ME.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.767
I'M SURE MEL WOULD KNOW.
SHE'S A WIZ WITH HARDWARE.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.869
- OH, I BET.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.838
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST HIRE
SOMEONE ELSE.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.140
- HEY! IT'S YOUR DUTY
AS A FATHER

05:40.173 --> 05:41.709
TO BUILD YOUR SON'S
FIRST SWING SET.

05:41.742 --> 05:45.379
NOW GET CRACKING--I WANT IT
READY FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.980
- I KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE
ONLY YESTERDAY

05:47.014 --> 05:48.449
I WAS JACKING OFF
INTO THAT CUP.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.583
- [giggling]

05:49.617 --> 05:50.784
AND YOU AND MICHAEL
AND JUSTIN

05:50.818 --> 05:53.120
WERE TEARING INTO THE ROOM.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.456
YOU COULDN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAD A SON.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.024
[socket wrench cranking]

05:57.057 --> 05:59.126
TWO SONS.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.732
- WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE HIS MOTHER A CALL

06:04.765 --> 06:07.000
AND SEE HOW HE'S DOING?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.002
- SHE DOESN'T EVER WANT ME
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.672
- I KNOW, BUT MAYBE
IF YOU SPOKE TO HER--

06:11.705 --> 06:13.707
- NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.443
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.982
WAIT, WAIT.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.453
FUCK THIS.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.154
MAYBE I'LL HAVE IT DONE
IN TIME FOR YOUR WEDDING.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.189
- OHH, THERE WON'T
BE ANY WEDDING.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.991
HMM, MEL TURNED ME DOWN.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.093
[both chuckling]

06:33.126 --> 06:36.630
OH, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU
LAUGHING, FINALLY, ASSHOLE.

06:36.664 --> 06:40.033
- YOU FINALLY PROPOSED
TO HER AND SHE BLEW YOU OFF?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.569
HOW COME?

06:41.602 --> 06:44.905
- OH, FOR REASONS I'M SURE
YOU'D APPRECIATE.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.641
"I DON'T THINK A MEANINGLESS,
HETEROSEXUAL RITUAL

06:47.675 --> 06:50.711
WOULD PROVE OUR LOVE, AND IT
WOULDN'T BE LEGAL ANYWAY."

06:50.744 --> 06:52.546
- HEY, CAN'T ARGUE
WITH THAT.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.015
- HEY, I WAS ON THE DEBATE TEAM.
I CAN ARGUE ANYTHING.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.951
- BUT I THINK, FOR ONCE,
I AGREE WITH MELANIE.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.921
FUCK WEDDINGS.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.923
FUCK RITUALS, AND...

07:02.956 --> 07:05.959
FUCK THIS SWING SET!
- [chuckles]

07:05.993 --> 07:07.461
- MIKE!

07:07.495 --> 07:09.196
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.631
- YOU TOO, TRACE.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.199
- WHAT MADE YOU COME BACK?

07:12.232 --> 07:13.934
YOU WERE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT GOING.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.803
- DAVID AND I BROKE UP.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.205
- OH...TSK.
I'M SORRY.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.541
- YEAH.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.676
SO I'M JUST KIND OF
PICKING UP WHERE I LEFT OFF.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.112
I THOUGHT I'D COME BY HERE
AND SEE IF MY OLD JOB IS...

07:25.145 --> 07:27.247
- WELL,
LOOK WHO'S HONORING US

07:27.280 --> 07:29.216
WITH HIS PRESENCE.
- HEY, ANDREW.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.519
- NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE YOU
AGAIN, NOVOTNY.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.554
- MIKE'S MOVED BACK
TO PITTSBURGH.

07:33.587 --> 07:37.525
- NO KIDDING?
MUST'VE MISSED IT ON THE NEWS.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.160
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
RESTOCKING?

07:40.193 --> 07:41.995
- YES, SIR.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.003
- SO THINGS DIDN'T
WORK OUT, HUH?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.739
- WELL, I WOULDN'T...
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.041
I MEAN, SOMETIMES YOU NEED
TO TRY NEW THINGS.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.610
DISCOVER WHAT'S RIGHT
FOR YOU, AND...

07:56.644 --> 07:58.045
WHERE YOU REALLY BELONG,
AND I DISCOVERED

07:58.078 --> 08:01.649
THAT WHAT'S RIGHT
FOR ME IS...

08:01.682 --> 08:02.916
BEING HERE, YOU KNOW.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.118
MAYBE EVEN GETTING
MY OLD JOB BACK.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.120
- OHH, HATE TO BREAK
IT TO YOU,

08:07.154 --> 08:08.956
BUT YOUR OLD JOB'S
BEEN FILLED.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.658
- OH.
- AFTER YOU LEFT,

08:10.691 --> 08:11.892
DON PROMOTED ME.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.127
- THAT'S GREAT.
- YEAH.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.997
I WAS GLAD TO SEE
HE FINALLY CAME TO HIS SENSES.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.932
SO I GUESS
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.868
- I GUESS I AM.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.736
UM...

08:22.770 --> 08:25.873
WELL, IF YOU HAPPEN TO HEAR
OF ANYTHING...

08:25.906 --> 08:27.575
- WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

08:27.608 --> 08:29.209
WE DO HAVE A POSITION
FOR WHICH I THINK

08:29.242 --> 08:30.744
YOU'D BE IDEALLY SUITED,

08:30.778 --> 08:32.680
SINCE YOU ALREADY HAD IT.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.949
ASSISTANT MANAGER.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.552
- YOU MEAN...
WORKING FOR YOU?

08:38.586 --> 08:41.922
- YOU GOT IT.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.025
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.699
- HE HAD NIGHTMARES
AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.267
I WENT IN TO COMFORT HIM,
BUT, UH...

08:54.301 --> 08:57.638
THE DOCTOR SAYS IT'S...
NORMAL.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.773
[scoffs] IF YOU CAN
CALL THAT NORMAL,

08:59.807 --> 09:05.012
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR...
IF SOMEONE'S BEEN ATTACKED.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.614
BUT...
[sighs]

09:06.647 --> 09:08.882
TO SEE HIM IN
THAT KIND OF PAIN...

09:08.916 --> 09:10.851
YOU KNOW,
I WANT TO HELP HIM.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.854
ONLY THERE DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE ANY WAY.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.923
I CAN'T.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.058
- IT'S OKAY.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.193
[sniffles]

09:20.227 --> 09:21.194
- OH, HERE.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.796
- THANKS.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.901
- HAVE SOME COCONUT CAKE.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.903
- OH...NO, THANKS.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.772
- VIC MADE IT HIMSELF.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.074
- YEAH, IT'S MY WARM-UP
FOR GUS'S BIRTHDAY.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.208
- HE USED TO BE
A PASTRY CHEF.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.111
- BLACK BOTTOMS
WERE MY SPECIALTY.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.212
[clears throat]

09:39.246 --> 09:41.849
- I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.320
- MMM.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.957
THIS IS GOOD.
- TOO GOOD.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.859
- WE FAGGOTS
ARE A TALENTED BUNCH.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.093
YOU GOTTA HAND US THAT.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.729
- INDESTRUCTIBLE TOO.
[chuckling]

09:55.763 --> 09:58.198
IF AIDS AND GAY-BASHERS

09:58.231 --> 10:01.201
AND CRACKPOT CHRISTIANS
AND FUCKIN' REPUBLICANS

10:01.234 --> 10:06.406
CAN'T DESTROY YOU,
NOTHING CAN!

10:06.439 --> 10:08.842
- AND JUSTIN
WILL MAKE IT TOO.

10:08.876 --> 10:09.877
YOU'LL SEE.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.050
- AH. I GOTTA RUN.

10:17.084 --> 10:20.020
MOLLY'S GOING TO COME BACK
FROM HER PLAY DATE.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.091
THANKS FOR THE CAKE.
- [chuckles]

10:24.124 --> 10:26.193
WE'LL SEE YOU, JEN.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.929
- YOU KNOW, JEN, THEY SAY
THAT A BOY'S BEST FRIEND,

10:28.962 --> 10:31.865
ESPECIALLY A GAY BOY,
IS HIS MOTHER.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.201
BUT THAT'S
NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.937
MAYBE WHAT HE NEEDS RIGHT
NOW IS SOMEBODY ELSE,

10:36.970 --> 10:39.339
SOMEBODY WHO COULD GET
CLOSE TO HIM.

10:39.372 --> 10:43.143
MORE IMPORTANT, SOMEONE THAT
HE WOULD LIKE TO BE CLOSE TO.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.712
- DEBBIE,

10:44.745 --> 10:47.748
I'M SORRY, BUT NOT
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.885
- WELL...IT WAS
JUST A SUGGESTION.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.087
- BESIDES, I CAN LOOK
AFTER HIM MYSELF.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.390
- OF COURSE YOU CAN.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.692
- OKAY.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.083
- BRIAN!

11:26.319 --> 11:27.721
BRIAN!

11:31.992 --> 11:33.761
I'M GLAD IT'S YOU.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.063
- WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.198
WHERE YOU GOING?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.367
- IN.
- DID I SAY YOU COULD?

11:40.400 --> 11:43.003
- DON'T GIVE ME ANY SHIT,
ALL RIGHT?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.872
I NEARLY FREAKED OUT FIVE TIMES
GETTING HERE.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.807
- WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO NEARLY FREAK OUT

11:46.840 --> 11:49.009
FIVE MORE TIMES
GETTING HOME.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.344
- I WANT TO SEE YOU.
- WELL, YOU CAN'T, OKAY?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.783
- WHY NOT?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.517
ARE YOU FUCKING SOME GUY?

11:57.550 --> 12:00.187
- NONE OF YOUR FUCKING
BUSINESS.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.991
NOW GO AWAY.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.231
- BUT WHY?

12:12.900 --> 12:13.967
WHY?

12:14.001 --> 12:16.336
[background chatter,
phones ringing]

12:29.016 --> 12:30.984
- I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT
THIS GUY CAN TAKE.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.853
NO WONDER THEY CALL HIM
"THE CHUNNEL."

12:32.886 --> 12:35.522
- ARE YOU ON MISTERFISTER.NET
AGAIN?

12:35.555 --> 12:37.157
- IT'S MY LATE-AFTERNOON
COFFEE BREAK.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.259
- AS OPPOSED TO YOUR
EARLY-AFTERNOON COFFEE BREAK,

12:39.292 --> 12:41.261
YOUR LATE-MORNING COFFEE
BREAK...

12:41.294 --> 12:42.462
- SOME GUYS
GET ALL THE BREAKS.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.264
- WHEN DO YOU EVER FIND
THE TIME TO WORK?

12:44.297 --> 12:46.533
- I MANAGE TO FIT IT IN.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.068
ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW

12:48.101 --> 12:49.837
I SHOULD BE WORKING
ON THE MAGRUDER REPORT.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.538
WERTSHAFTER'S
EXPECTING IT AT...

12:51.571 --> 12:54.141
HOLY SHIT. HE'S PLAYING
"HIDE THE HYDRANT."

12:54.174 --> 12:57.010
- THE FIRE HYDRANT?

12:57.044 --> 12:58.511
- FUCK!

12:58.545 --> 12:59.579
SHIT.
- WHAT?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.014
WHAT?

13:01.048 --> 13:02.249
- I JUST SPILLED COFFEE
ON MY PANTS.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.583
- WATCH OUT FOR THE CREAM.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.353
- I-I GOTTA GET OFF.
- SURE YOU DIDN'T ALREADY?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.022
- OH.

13:09.056 --> 13:12.592
- FUCK!

13:12.625 --> 13:13.861
- SCHMIDT.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.996
[man in video moaning]

13:19.933 --> 13:22.269
- [stammering]
M-MR. WERTSHAFTER, I CAN--

13:22.302 --> 13:24.938
I CAN--I CAN EXPLAIN THIS.
I, UH, UH...

13:24.972 --> 13:27.040
[stammering]

13:27.074 --> 13:28.175
UH...
[man in video moaning]

13:28.208 --> 13:29.176
FUCK.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.577
- FUCK!

13:32.245 --> 13:33.413
FUCK!

13:35.048 --> 13:37.017
[grunts]

13:37.050 --> 13:38.451
- JUSTIN, MY GOD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.253
STOP IT! STOP!

13:40.287 --> 13:41.421
- WHY IS JUSTIN
FREAKING OUT?

13:41.454 --> 13:43.323
- MOLLY, GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM.
GO ON!

13:43.356 --> 13:44.557
JUSTIN, PLEASE,

13:44.591 --> 13:45.893
STOP IT, PLEASE--
[gasps]

13:45.926 --> 13:47.327
- YOU TOLD HIM

13:47.360 --> 13:49.196
YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO SEE ME
ANYMORE, DIDN'T YOU?

13:49.229 --> 13:50.530
- IT WAS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
AND HE AGREED.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.265
- YOU HAD NO RIGHT!

13:52.299 --> 13:54.334
- JUSTIN, I-I...
I JUST WANT YOU SAFE,

13:54.367 --> 13:55.936
I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE
ALL RIGHT. OH!

13:55.969 --> 13:57.570
- [shrieks and grunts]

13:57.604 --> 13:58.605
- WELL, GUESS WHAT?

13:58.638 --> 14:00.207
IT IS TOO LATE!

14:00.240 --> 14:01.909
THINGS ARE NEVER GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.211
MY LIFE IS FUCKED!

14:04.244 --> 14:06.113
CHRIS HOBBS SAW TO THAT.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.348
HE SHOULD'VE FUCKING
KILLED ME!

14:08.381 --> 14:10.483
- [sobs]

14:10.517 --> 14:12.052
[clattering]

14:12.085 --> 14:13.086
- UHH!

14:13.120 --> 14:15.355
- [panting]

14:15.388 --> 14:18.025
- AND THEN, FUCKING WERTSHAFTER
GAVE ME THE SHAFT!

14:18.058 --> 14:19.392
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.494
- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
THE FIRST 300 TIMES YOU TOLD ME.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.997
- I MEAN, HE FIRED ME.
ME, THE HARDEST WORKING,

14:24.031 --> 14:26.233
MOST DEVOTED EMPLOYEE
HE'S GOT, AND FOR WHAT?

14:26.266 --> 14:27.500
- WANKING TO THE WEB?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.202
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I WASN'T WANKING.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.371
I WAS WATCHING, SAME AS
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THAT OFFICE.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.006
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE:
I WASN'T WATCHING

14:33.040 --> 14:34.207
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WATCHES.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.009
- STRAIGHT SEX!
- YEAH.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.644
IT'S FINE TO SALIVATE

14:37.677 --> 14:40.313
OVER SOME BIMBO WITH BOOBS
THE SIZE OF FLOTATION DEVICES

14:40.347 --> 14:42.482
STUFFING A ZUCCHINI
UP HER TWAT.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.052
BUT GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD SEE
SOME GUY WITH PECS OF DEATH

14:45.085 --> 14:46.619
SQUATTING ON A ROAD TEEPEE.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.388
OH, THEN YOU'RE INSTANTLY
OUT ON YOUR ASS!

14:48.421 --> 14:50.090
- THAT'S DISCRIMINATION
IN THE WORKPLACE.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.558
- YOU'RE DAMNED RIGHT
IT IS.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.293
IF HE THINKS FOR A MINUTE THAT
I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT BACK

14:53.326 --> 14:55.528
BECAUSE I'M TOO COWARDLY
TO REVEAL MY SEXUALITY,

14:55.562 --> 14:58.999
LIKE YOU--NO OFFENSE--
THEN HE IS MIGHTILY MISTAKEN.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.400
- DON'T WORRY, TED.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.534
WITH YOUR EDUCATION
AND EXPERIENCE,

15:01.568 --> 15:02.635
YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER JOB.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.636
- YEAH, I WOULDN'T
BE SO SURE.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.572
NOT AFTER THEY FIND OUT
THE REASON I WAS CANNED.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.407
CHRIST!
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

15:07.440 --> 15:08.508
- MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
IN HERE.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.011
- WHAT, IN THAT FAG RAG?
PLEASE.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.012
- WELL, I WAS THINKING

15:12.045 --> 15:13.680
OF LOOKING FOR A MOONLIGHTING
POSITION MYSELF,

15:13.713 --> 15:17.150
SOMETHING TO AUGMENT MY INCOME,
AND MY TUSH.

15:17.184 --> 15:18.418
WHOO, WHAT'S THIS?

15:18.451 --> 15:20.420
"EARN UP TO $100
AN HOUR."

15:20.453 --> 15:22.289
AN HOUR?
- DOING WHAT?

15:22.322 --> 15:23.656
- WHY DON'T WE
CALL AND FIND OUT?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.625
[phone dialing]

15:25.658 --> 15:28.661
HELLO, YES, I--I CAME
ACROSS YOUR AD IN OUT.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.030
- IT WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.631
- SHH!

15:31.664 --> 15:34.301
IS IT TRUE YOU CAN EARN UP
TO $100 AN HOUR?

15:34.334 --> 15:36.036
REALLY?

15:36.069 --> 15:38.405
AND, UM, AND WHAT EXACTLY
DOES ONE HAVE TO DO?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.307
- VOLUNTEER FOR HIDEOUS
MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS?

15:40.340 --> 15:41.241
- [scoffs]

15:41.274 --> 15:43.676
- SERVE AS A LIVE TARGET
FOR THE MILITARY?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.712
- OH, THAT'S ALL?
OH.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.514
IT'S ONE OF THOSE DOMESTIC
SERVICES.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.182
WAITERS, PRIVATE PARTIES,
MAIDS.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.284
- THAT'S A LOT OF BUCKS
FOR LIGHT HOUSEKEEPING.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.219
- I COULD MAKE
MORE IN A COUPLE HOURS

15:52.252 --> 15:54.287
THAN I COULD MAKE
IN A WEEK AT THE BIG Q.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.722
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:55.755 --> 15:58.591
- I HAVE AN M.B.A.
FROM WHARTON.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.193
I DON'T DO WINDOWS.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.328
- I HAVE THREE SEMESTERS

16:01.361 --> 16:02.695
FROM ALLEGHENY
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

16:02.729 --> 16:03.763
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.466
- OH, THAT'S FABULOUS.
YES.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.767
ALL RIGHT, WELL THANK YOU!
MM-HMM.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.571
THEY HAVE OPENINGS
RIGHT NOW.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.207
WELL, BOYS...

16:14.241 --> 16:15.642
THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.678
[exhaling rhythmically]

16:30.290 --> 16:32.759
- DID YOU EVER SEE
CITIZEN KANE?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.694
- YEAH.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.663
ALL MY LIFE,
ALL I'VE EVER HEARD

16:36.696 --> 16:40.067
IS HOW IT'S THE GREATEST
FUCKIN' MOVIE EVER MADE.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.436
SO I FINALLY RENT IT.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.806
THE GUY WHO PLAYS
THE LEAD IS FAT...

16:46.839 --> 16:49.776
THE STORY
ABOUT SOME SLED SUCKS...

16:49.809 --> 16:51.778
AND IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE.

16:51.811 --> 16:55.782
- MAYBE YOU WERE EXPECTING
TOO MUCH.

16:55.815 --> 16:59.252
- LIKE WITH YOU.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.287
ALL I'VE EVER HEARD

17:00.320 --> 17:04.491
IS HOW BRIAN KINNEY
IS THE GREATEST FUCK EVER.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.494
IF YOU ASK ME, YOU'RE BOTH
HIGHLY OVERRATED.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.496
- EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC.
- AHH.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.472
- NEXT TIME, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
RENT BUTTHOLE BOYS.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.308
I GAVE IT TWO THUMBS UP.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.480
- I-I CAME AT THE WRONG TIME.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.183
- YOU TWO HAVE A LOT
IN COMMON.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.756
- MAY I COME IN?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.434
YOUR PLACE IS VERY...

17:47.467 --> 17:48.501
GLAMOROUS.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.737
- DOES THE TRICK.
- I'M SURE.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.675
YOU KNOW, IF--

17:55.708 --> 17:57.577
IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE
SELLING, I'M A--

17:57.610 --> 18:00.480
I'M A REALTOR NOW.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.382
- HE'S NOT HERE.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.850
- I KNOW.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.485
THAT'S WHY I CAME.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.520
TO ASK YOU A FAVOR.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.356
- I ALREADY DID YOU ONE.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.425
- YEAH, BUT, UH...

18:12.459 --> 18:15.895
THIS ONE'S FOR HIM.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.565
I WANT YOU TO TAKE HIM.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.699
- EXCUSE ME?

18:19.732 --> 18:22.369
- I WANT YOU TO TAKE
MY SON.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.141
- MRS. TAYLOR...
- JENNIFER.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.277
- WHATEVER.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.379
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:32.412 --> 18:34.814
- HE, UM...

18:34.847 --> 18:37.217
WON'T LET ANYONE TOUCH HIM,
WON'T...

18:37.250 --> 18:39.619
LET ANYONE NEAR HIM.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.221
HE SHOWS PRACTICALLY
NO EMOTION

18:41.254 --> 18:43.656
EXCEPT WHEN HE'S IN ONE OF HIS
RAGES, OR HE...

18:43.690 --> 18:45.492
WAKES UP SCREAMING
FROM A NIGHTMARE.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.826
BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN
THE WORST PART.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.828
THE WORST PART IS, UM...

18:48.861 --> 18:53.200
STANDING THERE...
HELPLESS.

18:53.233 --> 18:57.136
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE?

18:58.871 --> 19:01.808
- WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO DO?

19:01.841 --> 19:05.778
- TOUCH HIM.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.614
HELP HIM BE TOUCHED.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.551
- YOU WANT ME TO FUCK HIM?

19:13.653 --> 19:17.790
- WELL, UH...

19:17.824 --> 19:21.794
YOU'RE THE ONE HE TRUSTS.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.331
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES...

19:24.364 --> 19:26.599
- I THOUGHT YOU NEVER
WANTED ME TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.201
- I DON'T.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.370
BUT, UM...

19:30.403 --> 19:32.239
IF I'M EVER GOING TO...

19:32.272 --> 19:37.610
SEE MY SON EVEN REMOTELY
RESEMBLE THE PERSON HE WAS,

19:37.644 --> 19:39.178
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.319
- THEN THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO?

19:46.353 --> 19:48.621
NO RECOURSE, NO LAWSUIT,
NO DAMAGES?

19:48.655 --> 19:49.656
- IN TWO WORDS, TEDDY:

19:49.689 --> 19:51.291
YOU'RE SCREWED.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.825
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S THREE
WITH THE CONTRACTION.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.361
- [chuckles]

19:54.394 --> 19:55.728
- OW!
[muttering]

19:55.762 --> 19:57.730
FUCK THIS THING.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.898
THERE'S NO LAW IN THIS STATE

19:58.931 --> 20:01.401
THAT PREVENTS DISCRIMINATION
OF GAYS IN THE WORKPLACE.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.703
WERTSHAFTER CAN DO WHATEVER
THE HELL HE WANTS.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.472
YEAH...
FUCKING SON OF A BITCH.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.407
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A MIND
TO WALK RIGHT IN

20:07.440 --> 20:08.408
TO TELL HIM
EXACTLY HOW I FEEL!

20:08.441 --> 20:09.776
- WHY DON'T YOU?

20:09.809 --> 20:11.278
LOOK HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE,
AND TELL HIM

20:11.311 --> 20:12.712
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE LAW
PERMITS IT,

20:12.745 --> 20:14.714
YOU THINK WHAT HE DID IS
UNJUSTIFIED AND UNCONSCIONABLE.

20:14.747 --> 20:18.651
- RIGHT.
I JUST MIGHT DO THAT.

20:18.685 --> 20:19.686
MAYBE.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.987
- [sighs]

20:21.020 --> 20:22.021
- ALL RIGHT,
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.323
AND THE SUCKER.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.792
- BYE.
- BYE.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.394
POOR TED.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.862
- JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE
OF HAVING NO RIGHTS.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.863
- LIKE GETTING MARRIED.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.466
- YOU--ARE YOU GOING TO START
WITH THAT AGAIN?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.735
- HEY, WILL YOU LET ME
FINISH?

20:35.768 --> 20:38.305
THAT NIGHT WE CAME BACK
FROM MY SISTER'S WEDDING,

20:38.338 --> 20:39.706
I WENT INTO THE GARDEN
AFTER YOU FELL ASLEEP.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.040
- YOU DID?

20:41.073 --> 20:43.476
- MM-HM. I STOOD
AND IMAGINED EXACTLY

20:43.510 --> 20:45.312
HOW I WANTED OUR WEDDING
TO LOOK.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.746
A WHATCHA-CALLIT,
A HOOPA?

20:46.779 --> 20:47.747
- CHUPPAH.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.849
- CHUPPAH
UNDER THE SYCAMORES,

20:49.882 --> 20:52.018
WHITE SATIN RIBBON BOWS
ON THE ARBORS

20:52.051 --> 20:54.754
AND LITTLE TWINKLING LIGHTS
EVERYWHERE, LIKE THE MILKY WAY.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.988
- UH-HUH.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.089
- BUT TODAY,
I WAS OUTSIDE

20:57.123 --> 20:59.959
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO DECORATE FOR GUS'S PARTY,

20:59.992 --> 21:03.463
AND I SAID TO MYSELF,
"PETERSON, WHAT THE HELL

21:03.496 --> 21:05.365
"WERE YOU THINKING?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.500
"I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
20 TOTS HERE ON SATURDAY.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.335
"YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DEAL WITH

21:08.368 --> 21:11.538
"TANTRUMS AND TEARS
AND THROW-UP.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.673
"MEL'S RIGHT.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.476
THE TIME TO BE ROMANTIC
HAS PASSED."

21:17.810 --> 21:20.747
- WELL...NO.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.714
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.016
- "IT'S A SILLY RITUAL
FOR STRAIGHT PEOPLE.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.386
A BANKRUPT INSTITUTION."

21:26.419 --> 21:29.789
NO. WE HAVE TO BE
PRACTICAL NOW.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.392
SO I APOLOGIZE FOR MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.693
AND I PROMISE

21:33.726 --> 21:38.898
TO NEVER,
NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.669
- SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD
KEEP US APART.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.738
[high-pitched] "I DON'T WANT YOU
SEEING MY SON ANYMORE."

21:45.772 --> 21:47.540
WE SHOWED HER.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.609
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?
- WHAT FOR?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.077
- BECAUSE I SAID SO,
AND BECAUSE YOU SOUND LIKE

21:51.110 --> 21:52.945
AN IMMATURE BRAT.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.782
- MAYBE I AM.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.786
- THEN YOU CAN GET YOUR ASS OUT
AND WALK HOME.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.523
RIGHT NOW.

22:03.556 --> 22:06.459
- WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

22:06.493 --> 22:07.960
- SHE WAS TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.128
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE

22:09.161 --> 22:11.831
TO HAVE A MOTHER
LIKE THAT.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.933
- NOW I GET TO STAY WITH YOU.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.735
YEE-HAW!

22:15.768 --> 22:19.706
- JUST UNTIL YOU GET BETTER.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.874
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH ME.

22:21.908 --> 22:25.011
EXCEPT FOR MY...
GIMP HAND.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.747
FUCKING HOBBS.

22:27.780 --> 22:32.552
- JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,
ALL RIGHT?

22:32.585 --> 22:34.053
- HOW COME YOU'RE DOING THIS?

22:34.086 --> 22:36.055
- WHAT, DRIVING
WITH NO HANDS?

22:36.088 --> 22:38.391
- NO, WHY ARE YOU
LETTING ME STAY WITH YOU?

22:38.425 --> 22:42.895
- WHY DO YOU CARE?
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT, ISN'T IT?

22:42.929 --> 22:44.597
- I KNOW WHY.

22:44.631 --> 22:47.066
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU LOVE ME MADLY,

22:47.099 --> 22:50.002
PASSIONATELY, DEEPLY...

22:50.036 --> 22:52.104
JUST LIKE
I ALWAYS SUSPECTED.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.741
- GET THE REST OF THAT
STUFF OFF THE TRUCK.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.109
- THIS IS A PRETTY
FANCY PLACE.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.978
- WELL, FOR WHAT THEY'RE
PAYING US, IT'D HAVE TO BE.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.080
[chuckles]

23:01.113 --> 23:02.649
- I'VE NEVER
BEEN A WAITER.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.116
HOPE I CAN DO IT.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.587
- HONEY...THIS IS
YOUR FAMILY BUSINESS.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.155
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.591
NOW, YOU MAKE YOUR MOTHER
PROUD.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.059
- ARE YOU TWO
THE WAITERS?

23:13.092 --> 23:15.462
- UH, YES, SIR.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.829
- OHH.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.130
WELL, WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED?

23:18.164 --> 23:19.732
- UM, THEY SAID YOU'D
GIVE US OUR UNIFORMS

23:19.766 --> 23:20.967
WHEN WE GOT HERE.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.069
- OH, THE OUTFITS.
WHERE ARE THEIR OUTFITS?

23:23.102 --> 23:24.136
QUICKLY.
- RIGHT HERE.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.973
- QUICKLY.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.808
HURRY UP
AND PUT THESE ON.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.612
- IS EVERYTHING
OFF THE TRUCK?

23:32.645 --> 23:34.180
- WHERE'S THE REST OF THE TUX?

23:34.213 --> 23:35.815
- UGH.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.149
- UM, E-EXCUSE ME,
I-I THINK THERE'S BEEN A--

23:37.183 --> 23:39.085
A MISTAKE.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.154
[chatter and laughter]

23:42.188 --> 23:43.856
- WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HER?

23:43.890 --> 23:44.991
[laughter]

23:45.024 --> 23:45.992
- OH. SHH, SHH. SHH.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.560
- DESSERT'S A LITTLE EARLY.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.595
[laughter]

23:48.628 --> 23:51.831
- OOH...APPETIZERS.

23:51.864 --> 23:54.166
- UH, WH-WHITE WINE,
OR--OR RED?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.201
- UH, WHITE.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.003
- VERY GOOD, SIR.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.608
[men chuckling lewdly]

24:01.641 --> 24:02.742
- AND RED.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.944
- SOME GUYS HAVE
ALL THE LUCK.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.547
[all chuckling]
- HE'S GONNA WAIT FOR THE MEAT.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.716
[indistinct chatter]

24:09.749 --> 24:10.883
- SHRIMP BALLS?

24:10.917 --> 24:13.185
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.887
OOH-OOH-HOO!

24:14.921 --> 24:17.857
[men laughing]

24:19.892 --> 24:21.961
- KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF
THE TENDERLOIN.

24:21.994 --> 24:22.962
all: OOH...

24:22.995 --> 24:24.931
- WHOO, PRECIOUS.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.245
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ALL THE WAY OVER THERE?

24:42.649 --> 24:44.884
- COME CLOSER.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.991
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF SOME
OF THE CLOTHES?

24:52.024 --> 24:54.226
YOU MIGHT GET OVERHEATED.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.253
ROLL OVER.

25:53.753 --> 25:56.222
- NO, DON'T.
DON'T.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.825
[panting]

26:02.028 --> 26:03.896
I CAN'T.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.214
- IT'S OKAY.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.216
- IT'S NOT OKAY.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.863
- YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE
WHO HAS ENOUGH DISORDERS

26:36.896 --> 26:38.965
TO MERIT YOUR OWN
CLASSIFICATION

26:38.998 --> 26:41.668
IN THE DIAGNOSTIC
AND STATISTICAL MANUAL,

26:41.701 --> 26:44.370
YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST
WELL ADJUSTED

26:44.403 --> 26:48.107
AND HIGH FUNCTIONING
BASTARDS I KNOW.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.843
- THANKS.
- WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

26:50.877 --> 26:54.280
- A SERIES OF HOPELESS
ADDICTIONS, FOR ONE.

26:54.313 --> 26:58.885
AND NEVER SEEING A SHRINK,
FOR ANOTHER.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.255
- YOU'RE SEEING ONE NOW.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.858
SO, UH, YOU TRIED
TO HOLD HIM,

27:05.892 --> 27:06.959
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM,

27:06.993 --> 27:10.229
BUT HE WOULDN'T LET YOU
TOUCH HIM?

27:10.262 --> 27:13.900
THAT MUST BE A FIRST
FOR YOU.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.768
HOWEVER,
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.670
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HAPPENS,

27:17.704 --> 27:20.406
NATURALLY HE'S GOING TO BE
AFRAID TO LET ANYONE TOUCH HIM.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.842
EVEN YOU.
- BUT HE'LL GET OVER IT, RIGHT?

27:22.875 --> 27:26.145
THAT DEPENDS.
IT'S LIKE A--A FAIRY TALE.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.347
RAPUNZEL
TRAPPED IN THE TOWER,

27:28.380 --> 27:30.116
HANSEL AND GRETEL
CAGED BY THE WITCH.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.784
ONLY IN THIS CASE,

27:31.818 --> 27:35.722
IT'S JUSTIN'S MEMORY
THAT'S BEEN LOCKED UP.

27:35.755 --> 27:39.158
AND IT'S--IT'S UP TO YOU
TO RELEASE IT,

27:39.191 --> 27:41.327
HANDSOME PRINCE.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.163
- [sighs]
AND...

27:44.196 --> 27:45.765
HOW THE FUCK
DO I DO THAT?

27:45.798 --> 27:47.767
- TRIGGER HIS MEMORY.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.003
GET HIM TO FEEL THE PAIN.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.071
- ARE YOU SHITTING ME?

27:52.104 --> 27:55.975
NO. UNTIL HE CAN PROCESS IT
AND MOVE BEYOND IT,

27:56.008 --> 27:59.912
HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO FEEL
ISOLATED, UNHAPPY, ALONE.

27:59.946 --> 28:03.315
HE'S NOT JUST THE WALKING
WOUNDED.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.117
THE WALKING DEAD.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.389
- AHH.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.324
YOU'RE VERY ELOQUENT
WHEN I'M DRUNK.

28:12.358 --> 28:16.028
- [snorts]

28:16.062 --> 28:17.764
I'M AFRAID OUR TIME'S UP.

28:21.367 --> 28:25.204
- SO HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?

28:25.237 --> 28:28.274
- I'LL TAKE IT OUT
IN TRADE...

28:29.508 --> 28:31.811
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU
IN THE BATHS.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.712
- HEH.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.853
- IT WAS AWFUL.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.755
ALL THESE DIRTY-MINDED
OLD MEN

28:42.789 --> 28:44.423
STARING AT ME
AND PINCHING MY ASS.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.358
- IT WAS FABULOUS. ALL THESE
DIRTY-MINDED OLD MEN

28:46.392 --> 28:48.494
STARING AT ME,
PINCHING MY ASS.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.029
- WELCOME TO
POINT-COUNTERPOINT.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.131
- BESIDES, WHAT ARE A FEW
BRUISE MARKS?

28:52.164 --> 28:54.233
NOW, DOESN'T THAT FEEL
BETTER?

28:54.266 --> 28:56.836
WE EACH MADE $500.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.370
- HOW MUCH IS THAT
AFTER TAXES?

28:58.404 --> 28:59.338
- WHAT ARE YOU
ASKING ME FOR?

28:59.371 --> 29:01.974
- YOU'RE AN ACCOUNTANT.
- WAS AN ACCOUNTANT.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.210
- WELL, IT'S CLEAR TO ME
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.113
- HOW TO OPEN A MILK CARTON
ISN'T CLEAR TO YOU.

29:07.146 --> 29:10.316
NEVERTHELESS, I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.151
- SUE HIM.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.386
KICK HIS HOMOPHOBIC ASS...

29:14.420 --> 29:16.088
- OW!
- OH.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.925
SORRY, SWEETIE. TO COURT.
AND SUE HIM FOR 10 MIL.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.893
NO, MAKE IT 20.
OKAY, THERE.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.429
[chuckles]
MY TURN.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.798
- THAT'S BRILLIANT,
ONLY, MELANIE TOLD ME

29:25.832 --> 29:27.133
THERE'S NO LAWS
IN THIS STATE

29:27.166 --> 29:29.535
COVERING DISCRIMINATION
BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.370
- SCRATCH THAT.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.339
- NO, JUST RUB.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.109
- I'M GOING TO TALK
TO WERTSHAFTER.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.978
CONFRONT HIM LIKE A MAN.
TELL HIM, "LOOK,

29:39.011 --> 29:41.147
"I'VE BEEN A LOYAL AND DEVOTED
EMPLOYEE HERE FOR NINE YEARS.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.414
"YOU'VE GOT NO RIGHT
TO TREAT ME LIKE THIS

29:42.448 --> 29:44.550
JUST BECAUSE I'M GAY."

29:44.583 --> 29:46.819
THEN I'M GOING TO GROVEL.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.020
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

29:48.054 --> 29:51.023
- WHAT KIND OF PATHETIC
PUSSY BOYS ARE YOU?

29:51.057 --> 29:52.925
WHERE'S YOUR PRIDE?
WHERE'S YOUR SELF-RESPECT?

29:52.959 --> 29:54.026
WHERE'S YOUR DIGNITY?

29:54.060 --> 29:56.562
[phone rings]

29:56.595 --> 29:57.563
HELLO?

29:57.596 --> 30:00.599
YES, THIS IS HE.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.902
WHAT? YES, I-I BELIEVE
I WOULD BE AVAILABLE.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.170
MM-HMM.

30:04.203 --> 30:07.039
MM-HMM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.942
A WEALTHY CLIENT WOULD LIKE
AN ATTRACTIVE DOMESTIC

30:09.976 --> 30:11.543
TO POLISH HIS SILVER.

30:11.577 --> 30:12.644
- I HOPE YOUR ASS HOLDS UP.

30:12.678 --> 30:15.547
- HMM. 100 BUCKS AN HOUR
BUYS AN AWFUL LOT OF LOTION.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.984
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
I'M OFF TO BUFF IN THE BUFF!

30:18.017 --> 30:19.518
- SO MUCH FOR DIGNITY.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.193
- * I KNOW THERE'S
A MAGIC KEY *

30:27.226 --> 30:29.228
*

30:29.261 --> 30:30.596
* GONNA FIND IT SOON,
YOU'LL SEE *

30:30.629 --> 30:34.133
- WELL...WE WERE DANCING.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.136
AND, UM, I THINK THEY WERE
PLAYING THIS.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.537
ANYWAYS, THAT'S WHEN
BRIAN CAME IN,

30:38.570 --> 30:41.207
AND HE HAD ON...A TUX.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.310
AND A WHITE SILK SCARF.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.013
*

30:47.046 --> 30:50.282
- I THINK I REMEMBER THAT.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.618
I'M NOT SURE.

30:52.651 --> 30:56.122
- WELL, UM...
HE LOOKED AWESOME!

30:56.155 --> 31:00.459
AND HE SAID TO ME...

31:00.492 --> 31:03.495
- YOU LOOK HOT, DAPHNE.
I'D FUCK YOU.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.331
[giggles]

31:05.364 --> 31:08.367
AND THEN HE ASKED
IF HE COULD BORROW YOU

31:08.400 --> 31:10.336
TO DANCE,
AND HE TOOK YOUR HAND,

31:10.369 --> 31:13.172
AND, UH, LED YOU
TO THE DANCE FLOOR.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.377
THEY WERE PLAYING THIS.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.147
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.681
MAYBE, UH...

31:22.714 --> 31:24.283
YOU'LL REMEMBER SOMETHING.

31:24.316 --> 31:27.519
- * WHEN I HEAR EVERYBODY SAY

31:27.553 --> 31:32.191
* THAT OLD CLICHE
ABOUT A FISH IN THE SEA *

31:32.224 --> 31:33.993
* I JUST LAUGH

31:34.026 --> 31:35.694
* 'CAUSE THEY GOT NO CLUE

31:35.727 --> 31:40.332
* HOW I FEEL FOR YOU,
YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME *

31:40.366 --> 31:42.401
* AND WHEN YOU'RE DOWN

31:42.434 --> 31:45.037
* WHAT LOVE'S ABOUT,
BABY, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE *

31:45.071 --> 31:47.506
- [sighs]
- WELL?

31:47.539 --> 31:51.443
- WE REALLY DANCED
TO THIS CORNY OLD SONG?

31:51.477 --> 31:54.013
- [chuckles]
WELL...

31:54.046 --> 32:00.719
MY--I'D PREFER TO THINK OF IT
AS "RIDICULOUSLY ROMANTIC."

32:00.752 --> 32:03.389
- YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN IT.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.525
YOU AND BRIAN HAD
THE ENTIRE FLOOR TO YOURSELVES.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.427
- * OH, I COULD NEVER GO

32:08.460 --> 32:10.462
- WE DID SOME, UM...

32:10.496 --> 32:11.630
PRETTY FANCY MOVES.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.099
- * YOU KNOW IT TOO

32:13.132 --> 32:15.167
- MOUTHS WERE DROPPING.

32:15.201 --> 32:16.568
IT WAS SO COOL,
AND THEN,

32:16.602 --> 32:18.370
WHEN YOU GUYS KISSED...

32:18.404 --> 32:20.372
IT WAS SO HOT.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.575
- YOU KISSED ME?

32:23.609 --> 32:25.744
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY?

32:25.777 --> 32:29.181
- YEAH.

32:29.215 --> 32:31.117
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.719
- * I'M THE ONLY ONE
FOR YOU *

32:33.752 --> 32:35.521
* THAT YOU'RE MINE

32:35.554 --> 32:40.259
* AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
FOR YOU *

32:40.292 --> 32:43.229
- SO, FIRST DAY BACK.
HOW'D YOU FEEL?

32:43.262 --> 32:46.465
- HEH, LIKE I NEVER LEFT.
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.767
WORKING AT THE BIG Q KIND OF
SPOILS YOU FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.270
- [chuckles] YEAH.
- THERE YOU ARE, NOVOTNY.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.738
STELLA JUST CALLED IN SICK.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.773
I NEED YOU TO STAY
TILL MIDNIGHT.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.343
- BUT I JUST FINISHED
A 10-HOUR SHIFT.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.578
- ARE YOU SAYING
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?

32:59.611 --> 33:01.447
BECAUSE I'D HATE TO THINK
I HIRED AN ASSISTANT MANAGER

33:01.480 --> 33:05.017
WHO'S REFUSING
TO DO THE JOB.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.219
- SURE, I'LL STAY.
HAPPY TO.

33:07.253 --> 33:08.487
- GOOD.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.689
TAKE OFF YOUR COAT,
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME,

33:10.722 --> 33:13.125
AND START RETAGGING THESE.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.593
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

33:14.626 --> 33:17.629
OH. AND, UH...

33:17.663 --> 33:19.065
WELCOME BACK.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.639
- LOOK, I CAN CALL MY
BOYFRIEND AND CANCEL DINNER.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.276
UH, HE NEEDS TO LOSE
A FEW POUNDS ANYWAY.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.111
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU GO ON, TRACE.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.514
THERE'S NO REASON EVERYONE'S
NIGHT SHOULD BE RUINED.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.483
- [sighs]
OKAY.

33:39.818 --> 33:42.754
- [on P.A.]
ATTENTION, BIG Q SHOPPERS,

33:42.788 --> 33:46.158
THE STORE WILL BE CLOSING
IN 15 MINUTES.

34:18.157 --> 34:22.428
- [sighs]

34:22.461 --> 34:27.799
- YOU WALKED DOWN WITH ME
BACK TO THE JEEP.

34:27.833 --> 34:31.103
AND WE WERE, UH...
WE WERE GOOFING...

34:31.137 --> 34:33.805
SINGING,
AND WE WERE DANCING...

34:33.839 --> 34:35.274
[laughter]

34:35.307 --> 34:37.709
I KISSED YOU.
YOU SAID, "LATER."

34:37.743 --> 34:40.312
- LATER.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.548
- AND THEN YOU TURNED AROUND,
AND, UM...

34:42.581 --> 34:44.183
SMILED.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.817
[chuckles]

34:45.851 --> 34:48.754
- HEH, THEN I KNEW WHY DEBBIE
CALLS YOU SUNSHINE.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.163
- AND THEN I WENT BACK
TO THE JEEP AND AS I...

34:57.196 --> 34:59.198
SAW HIM IN THE MIRROR COMING
AFTER YOU...

34:59.231 --> 35:00.866
- JUSTIN!

35:00.899 --> 35:02.701
[thud]

35:02.734 --> 35:04.870
[running footsteps]

35:04.903 --> 35:06.172
[bat clatters to ground]

35:06.205 --> 35:09.541
CHRIST!

35:09.575 --> 35:13.645
DON'T YOU...
REMEMBER ANYTHING?

35:15.481 --> 35:17.449
- [sighs]

35:19.418 --> 35:20.886
- [sighs]

35:42.541 --> 35:45.411
- I WISH I COULD REMEMBER.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.784
- I WISH I COULD FORGET.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.234
- SCHMIDT. WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

36:08.267 --> 36:11.570
- I, UH, CAME BY TO PICK UP
MY MR. COFFEE, AND...

36:11.603 --> 36:15.274
TO SPEAK WITH YOU, SIR,
IF I MAY.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.943
[clears throat]
MR. WERTSHAFTER,

36:17.976 --> 36:21.247
AS A LOYAL AND DEVOTED
EMPLOYEE HERE OF NINE YEARS...

36:21.280 --> 36:24.783
- 8 YEARS,
11 MONTHS, 6 DAYS.

36:24.816 --> 36:27.719
- [chuckles]

36:27.753 --> 36:30.222
YOU ALWAYS WERE
PRECISE, SIR.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.724
RIGHT DOWN TO THE DIGIT.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.826
THAT'S WHY IT SAYS
WERTSHAFTER ON THE DOOR,

36:34.860 --> 36:36.828
I GUESS...
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW...

36:36.862 --> 36:37.896
[nervous chuckle]

36:41.600 --> 36:44.670
I JUST--I WANT--
I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW...

36:44.703 --> 36:47.839
UNREASONABLE AND UNFAIR
I THINK IT IS

36:47.873 --> 36:50.842
THAT YOU DISMISSED ME OVER
SUCH A MINOR INFRACTION.

36:50.876 --> 36:51.777
I'M SURE IF IT HAD BEEN
ONE OF THE OTHERS,

36:51.810 --> 36:53.445
YOU WOULD'VE JUST
LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.847
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
IS BECAUSE I'M--I'M--

36:55.881 --> 36:57.416
- A HOMOSEXUAL.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.984
- PRECISELY.

36:59.017 --> 37:00.952
- YOU GAYS,

37:00.986 --> 37:03.822
EVERY TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS,
YOU THINK IT'S DISCRIMINATION.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.657
WELL, THIS ISN'T ABOUT
DISCRIMINATION.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.893
THIS IS ABOUT
COMPANY POLICY:

37:07.926 --> 37:09.361
"ANYONE FOUND
USING THE INTERNET

37:09.395 --> 37:11.563
"FOR REASONS OTHER
THAN BUSINESS PURPOSES

37:11.597 --> 37:14.700
WILL BE DISMISSED
FORTHWITH."

37:14.733 --> 37:15.867
YOU'RE LUCKY
I DIDN'T CHARGE YOU

37:15.901 --> 37:19.037
FOR THE TIME YOU SPENT
ONLINE.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.274
- YES, SIR.
THANK YOU, SIR.

37:23.709 --> 37:26.345
- SCHMIDT.
- YES, SIR?

37:26.378 --> 37:28.314
- ONE MORE THING.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.981
ARE YOU HAPPY
BEING AN ACCOUNTANT?

37:30.015 --> 37:32.484
- HAPPY?
- DOES BALANCING THE BOOKS

37:32.518 --> 37:34.653
MAKE YOUR HEART

37:40.091 --> 37:42.461
- NO, SIR.
NOT REALLY.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.830
- THEN I'M DOING YOU
A FAVOR.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.632
NEXT TIME,
FIND YOURSELF SOMETHING

37:46.665 --> 37:47.966
YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR.

37:47.999 --> 37:52.270
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE JUST
JERKING YOURSELF OFF.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.451
[chatter and cheers]

38:07.586 --> 38:09.688
- ISN'T THAT GORGEOUS?

38:11.089 --> 38:12.758
- LOOKY HERE.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.760
MAKE A WISH, SWEETHEART!

38:14.793 --> 38:16.462

38:20.399 --> 38:22.368

[big inhale]

38:23.569 --> 38:25.036
[blowing]

38:25.070 --> 38:26.905
[cheers and applause]

38:26.938 --> 38:30.642
- LET'S HAVE SOME CAKE!

38:30.676 --> 38:32.077
- YOU KNOW, I WOULD JUST
LIKE TO SAY

38:32.110 --> 38:34.480
WHAT A THRILL IT IS
FOR LINDSAY AND ME

38:34.513 --> 38:36.348
TO BE CELEBRATING OUR

HOW VERY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE

38:42.488 --> 38:43.555

38:43.589 --> 38:45.090

38:46.658 --> 38:48.660
- OKAY, GRAB A PLATE

COME ON.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.464
- HI.

38:52.498 --> 38:55.133
- THANK YOU.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.035
[indistinct chatter]

38:57.068 --> 38:58.336
- [chuckles]

38:59.871 --> 39:01.339
- MMM.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.075
- YES, HONEY?

39:04.109 --> 39:05.877
- ARE YOU AND HER MARRIED?

39:05.911 --> 39:09.581
- UM...

39:09.615 --> 39:11.550
- NO, SWEETIE, WE'RE NOT.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.519
- HOW COME?

39:13.552 --> 39:14.753
- ASK YOUR MOMMY AND DADDY

39:14.786 --> 39:16.588
TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
IN ABOUT...

39:16.622 --> 39:18.089
OH, 20 YEARS.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.827
[giggles]

39:32.638 --> 39:35.140
- WANT SOME?

39:35.173 --> 39:36.875
- YOU KNOW, WHITE FLOUR
AND WHITE SUGAR

39:36.908 --> 39:39.845
ARE ABOUT THE WORST THING
YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR BODY.

39:39.878 --> 39:40.846
- UH-HUH.

39:48.587 --> 39:52.624
30 YEARS AGO...

39:52.658 --> 39:55.527
WE HAD YOUR FIRST BIRTHDAY
PARTY.

39:55.561 --> 40:00.198
IN THE BACKYARD...WITH THE KIDS
AND THE CAKE...

40:00.231 --> 40:02.601
AND THE SWING SET.
HUH.

40:02.634 --> 40:06.505
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT A GRATCHET IS.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.741
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE,
HUH?

40:16.882 --> 40:19.718
- YOU'RE WRONG, MA.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.820
THINGS CHANGE A LOT.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.054
IF YOU DON'T
CHANGE WITH THEM,

40:23.088 --> 40:26.658
YOU GET LEFT BEHIND.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.927
LOOK AT ME, I'M--
I'M RIGHT BACK

40:28.960 --> 40:31.530
IN THE SAME PLACE
I WAS BEFORE,

40:31.563 --> 40:34.065
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
HAS MOVED ON.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.505
I FEEL LOST, MA.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.643
- OH, BABY.

40:44.676 --> 40:47.913
YOU'RE NOT LOST.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.581
YOU'RE JUST FULL OF SHIT.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.088
YOU'RE ONLY LOST
IF YOU'RE ALONE.

40:57.122 --> 41:01.927
YOU ARE SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.631
YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOUR WAY.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.570
NOW, GO ENJOY THE PARTY.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.974
HMM?
OH, WAIT.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.744
TSK. SHIT.

41:18.777 --> 41:19.845
[all gasp]

41:19.878 --> 41:21.747
- WOW...

41:21.780 --> 41:23.849
- OHH...

41:23.882 --> 41:26.251
- LET'S SEE!

41:26.284 --> 41:29.254
YES! OH HO HO!
LOOK!

41:29.287 --> 41:31.990
YOUR SON'S GOING TO BE
A BASEBALL PLAYER!

41:32.023 --> 41:33.692
- YEAH, WELL, IF YOU MAKE
A MAN OUT OF HIM,

41:33.725 --> 41:35.226
I'M GOING TO HOLD YOU
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.

41:35.260 --> 41:40.165
- [chuckles]
- WHOO, LOOK AT YOU.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.800
- BASEBALL!
- YAY!

41:45.637 --> 41:48.273
- YOU SWING THAT BAT,
BIG BOY!

41:48.306 --> 41:51.176
- JUSTIN.
- JUSTIN!

41:51.209 --> 41:52.844
- [gasps]

42:07.659 --> 42:09.828
- OOPS.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.130
THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A FIRST
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.899
- THANKS.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.601
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO
FOR HIS SECOND?

42:15.634 --> 42:17.669
- LEAVE TOWN AND STICK YOU
WITH IT.

42:17.703 --> 42:19.638
- [chuckles]
- HERE, GIVE ME A HAND.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.072
- OKAY.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.274
YOU KNOW, THIS, UH...

42:23.308 --> 42:26.211
WOULD BE THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR A WEDDING.

42:30.616 --> 42:32.984
THE WHITE SATIN BOWS
ON THE ARBOR...

42:33.018 --> 42:35.053
THE TWINKLING LIGHTS...

42:35.086 --> 42:38.089
A CHUPPAH.
ONLY NOT UNDER THE SYCAMORES.

42:38.123 --> 42:41.960
I WAS THINKING OVER
BY THE ROSE BUSHES.

42:45.330 --> 42:46.364
LINZ...

42:46.397 --> 42:50.035
- I THOUGHT WE PUT THIS
TO REST ONCE AND FOR ALL.

42:51.703 --> 42:54.072
- KENDALL MORGAN
WOKE IT UP IN ME.

42:54.105 --> 42:56.174
- WHO?

42:56.207 --> 42:58.844
- THE LITTLE GIRL WHO ASKED
IF WE WERE MARRIED.

42:58.877 --> 43:01.046
I REALIZED THAT,
SOMEDAY,

43:01.079 --> 43:05.083
OUR KID IS GOING TO ASK US
THAT VERY SAME QUESTION.

43:05.116 --> 43:07.819
AND WHEN HE DOES,
I HAVE TO SAY NO.

43:07.853 --> 43:09.287
THEN HE'D WANT
TO KNOW WHY NOT,

43:09.320 --> 43:11.356
AND THEN I'D HAVE
TO TELL HIM BECAUSE...

43:11.389 --> 43:14.325
STRAIGHT PEOPLE
WOULDN'T LET US.

43:14.359 --> 43:17.696
ONLY THAT'S NOT
THE WHOLE TRUTH.

43:17.729 --> 43:18.930
- WHICH IS?

43:18.964 --> 43:21.867
- WE WOULDN'T GIVE OURSELVES
PERMISSION.

43:26.071 --> 43:27.138
- SORRY.
- [clears throat]

43:37.282 --> 43:40.652
IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO BE ROMANTIC...

43:45.123 --> 43:47.993
LINDSAY PETERSON,

43:48.026 --> 43:49.995
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

43:53.431 --> 43:55.333
- NOW YOU'RE PROPOSING
TO ME?

43:58.336 --> 44:01.306
WELL, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO THINK IT OVER.

44:05.010 --> 44:06.111
YES!

44:06.144 --> 44:08.680
[both giggling]

44:08.714 --> 44:09.881
AAH!

44:09.915 --> 44:11.950
- [laughing]

44:11.983 --> 44:13.785
- UHH!

44:17.255 --> 44:18.790
- MMM.

44:18.824 --> 44:20.225
- [giggling]

44:20.258 --> 44:22.327
- AAAAH!

44:22.360 --> 44:25.463
[both laughing]

44:25.496 --> 44:28.099
[dishes clattering faintly]

45:00.799 --> 45:03.301
- BETTER NOW?
- MM-HMM.

45:15.246 --> 45:18.216
- YOU REALLY
FREAKED ME OUT.

45:18.249 --> 45:21.820
- WHAT, YOU?

45:21.853 --> 45:24.823
- IT WAS LIKE YOU GOT HIT
ALL OVER AGAIN.

45:27.292 --> 45:30.762
- I REMEMBERED
WALKING AWAY AND...

45:30.796 --> 45:32.998
SUDDENLY HEARING YOUR VOICE
CALL MY NAME

45:33.031 --> 45:38.003
TO WARN ME.

45:38.036 --> 45:40.238
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT THAT.

45:41.306 --> 45:43.041
YOU TRIED TO SAVE ME.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.946
- GUESS I FORGOT.

45:55.887 --> 45:58.323
- IT'S A GOOD THING
ONE OF US REMEMBERED.

46:41.099 --> 46:43.801
I WANT YOU INSIDE ME.

46:49.941 --> 46:52.477
- ARE YOU SURE?

46:52.510 --> 46:55.113
- YEAH. JUST...

46:55.146 --> 46:57.215
TAKE IT EASY.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.522
- LIKE THE FIRST TIME?

47:37.055 --> 47:39.257
- [gasping softly]

48:02.047 --> 48:06.517
- * YOU SEE

48:06.551 --> 48:08.686
