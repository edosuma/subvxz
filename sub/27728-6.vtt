00:01.040 --> 00:02.943
<i>Previously on</i> Roswell, New Mexico...

00:02.968 --> 00:05.479
I know that my sister was
murdered by an alien.

00:05.504 --> 00:07.019
So was it you, Max?

00:07.044 --> 00:09.021
<i>Liz Ortecho's looking for a murderer.</i>

00:09.046 --> 00:11.047
Let's give her one. I'm gonna confess.

00:11.072 --> 00:12.591
I'm the one that killed those girls.

00:12.616 --> 00:13.870
<i>We don't even know what
causes these blackouts.</i>

00:13.895 --> 00:15.403
I do. Last time

00:15.428 --> 00:16.518
she had an episode like this was
near the end of high school,

00:16.543 --> 00:17.858
when she was afraid I
was gonna abandon her.

00:17.883 --> 00:19.163
Okay, now she thinks
she's gonna lose you.

00:19.188 --> 00:21.354
She's freaking out, man. Isobel!

00:21.379 --> 00:22.416
What happened?

00:22.441 --> 00:23.537
It's happening again.

00:23.689 --> 00:24.758
<i>You have</i>

00:24.783 --> 00:25.788
no idea

00:25.813 --> 00:27.437
how much I know.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.613
<i>The morgue. How is that possible?</i>

00:29.652 --> 00:32.253
That's not your hand. Yours is too big.

00:32.278 --> 00:34.075
And-and Michael's was broken then.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.980
That is why you have been lying.

00:36.005 --> 00:37.424
<i>What is it, Michael?</i>

00:37.449 --> 00:39.248
I didn't kill those girls, Isobel.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.460
You know who did; you've always known.

00:41.485 --> 00:42.790
<i>It was Isobel,</i>

00:42.815 --> 00:44.048
wasn't it?

00:44.530 --> 00:45.961
Yes.

00:51.013 --> 00:52.763
<i>There are moments that
define our lives,</i>

00:52.788 --> 00:55.569
<i>and there are moments
that divide our lives.</i>

00:56.177 --> 00:58.562
<i>Incidents that separate
us into two people:</i>

00:58.991 --> 01:02.835
<i>who we were before and
who we will be after.</i>

01:03.458 --> 01:04.720
<i>Forever.</i>

01:05.057 --> 01:07.200
Kate Long's having a
boy-girl party tonight.

01:07.225 --> 01:08.631
Everyone is there.

01:08.656 --> 01:10.417
It's Michael's year to pick
the birthday plans, Iz.

01:10.442 --> 01:11.646
It's not even our real birthday.

01:11.671 --> 01:12.908
It's just the random day we were found

01:12.933 --> 01:15.740
wandering around in the desert.

01:15.765 --> 01:17.345
I got to pee.

01:19.925 --> 01:22.332
She's been extra annoying lately.

01:24.645 --> 01:27.714
So I can move stuff.

01:28.089 --> 01:31.046
Isobel can mess around
in people's thoughts.

01:31.071 --> 01:32.026
Figure out your thing yet?

01:32.051 --> 01:33.261
Other than causing a power outage

01:33.286 --> 01:34.674
every time I have a dirty dream?

01:36.584 --> 01:38.273
Worst superpower ever.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.006
- I'm defective.
- Are you kidding?

01:40.031 --> 01:43.001
Every time I get mad, I
accidentally throw furniture

01:43.081 --> 01:44.196
with my brain.

01:44.221 --> 01:45.989
I'm defective.

01:46.014 --> 01:47.079
Is that still happening?

01:47.104 --> 01:48.960
I'm mad a lot.

01:48.985 --> 01:50.675
The lady that runs the
group home got a priest

01:50.700 --> 01:54.544
to come over and expel
my demons last week.

01:55.163 --> 01:57.294
Turns out an exorcism kinda hurts.

01:57.319 --> 01:58.946
Geez, Michael.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.546
I don't think Jesus had
much to do with it.

02:02.332 --> 02:03.677
I'm fine.

02:03.702 --> 02:04.887
I don't want to talk about it.

02:09.437 --> 02:10.761
Isobel!

02:12.122 --> 02:13.499
Isobel!

Did he hurt you?

02:24.710 --> 02:27.589
Isobel? Isobel.

02:29.432 --> 02:30.910
He's got a knife.

02:37.209 --> 02:38.952
Ah!

02:42.280 --> 02:44.147
Max? What the...?

02:58.804 --> 03:00.483
Is he dead?

03:02.726 --> 03:05.514
- H-How'd you...?
- I just suddenly knew I could.

03:05.874 --> 03:07.373
Well, bring him back.

03:07.398 --> 03:09.294
I don't think it works like that.

03:11.753 --> 03:13.220
Iz, what do we do?

03:13.245 --> 03:15.278
Iz. Isobel.

03:21.930 --> 03:24.000
<i>One day we were children.</i>

03:24.952 --> 03:26.854
<i>And the next we were something else.</i>

03:26.879 --> 03:27.894
What are you doing?

03:27.919 --> 03:29.219
What's it look like?

03:29.456 --> 03:31.069
I'm digging a freaking grave.

03:31.959 --> 03:33.167
<i>I was a killer.</i>

03:33.363 --> 03:35.170
<i>Michael, an accomplice.</i>

03:35.195 --> 03:38.812
<i>And Isobel... Isobel was broken.</i>

03:50.092 --> 03:54.057
After we went camping, Isobel
started having these blackouts.

03:54.082 --> 03:57.263
And they were brief and rare.

03:58.231 --> 04:00.479
Just little moments
where she'd fade away.

04:01.734 --> 04:04.280
I read somewhere that after trauma,

04:04.305 --> 04:06.530
people can have some memory loss.

04:06.555 --> 04:07.925
I didn't realize at the time

04:07.950 --> 04:10.340
that I'd lost a piece of
my sister that night.

04:11.881 --> 04:15.433
Start talking about the night
that I lost mine, Max.

04:16.351 --> 04:17.843
Context matters.

04:18.163 --> 04:20.387
Look, who we were then matters.

04:21.202 --> 04:25.029
Do you remember what we
were like before Rosa died?

04:25.832 --> 04:27.367
It was the end of our senior year,

04:27.391 --> 04:29.776
the universe was ours.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.058
We could... do anything.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.042
We could be anyone.

04:34.014 --> 04:35.413
Pull.

04:38.791 --> 04:40.198
You never miss.

04:40.223 --> 04:42.445
Wow, it's like a useful superpower.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.632
Uh, so...

04:47.583 --> 04:49.499
I got a full ride to UNM today.

04:49.576 --> 04:51.055
- What?
- Yeah.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.783
Dude, that's awesome, man.

04:52.808 --> 04:55.213
Oh, man, I told you. Your
test scores are money.

04:55.238 --> 04:56.728
You gonna still stick with the plan?

04:56.753 --> 04:57.635
Oh, yeah.

04:57.660 --> 04:58.493
Yeah, I'll tutor over the summer,

04:58.518 --> 04:59.835
I'll earn enough to travel.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.400
Hostels, backpacking.

05:01.425 --> 05:02.844
European girls.

05:02.869 --> 05:05.701
No. I'm just gonna focus on writing.

05:05.990 --> 05:07.544
- All right.
- I got a novel in me.

05:07.569 --> 05:09.290
I just got to find it, okay?

05:09.650 --> 05:11.192
I know.

05:11.217 --> 05:13.006
Iz.

05:13.075 --> 05:14.485
Come on, aren't you
gonna say something?

05:14.510 --> 05:15.823
Congratulate him.

05:23.082 --> 05:25.300
What is her deal the last few weeks?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.081
Maybe she's just freaking out
'cause high school's ending?

05:28.106 --> 05:29.738
Or it's her latest ploy for attention.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.012
That.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.614
Only three more shifts

05:36.639 --> 05:38.100
at the Crashdown before
I can buy the car

05:38.125 --> 05:40.212
off of Rosa and then freedom.

05:40.785 --> 05:42.140
What about gas money?

05:42.165 --> 05:43.938
You're a joykill.

05:43.963 --> 05:45.888
Hey, Liz. Hey.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.067
Hey, Max. What are you reading?

05:48.092 --> 05:49.267
Oh, just...

05:51.584 --> 05:52.883
I'll take "high school clichés"

05:52.908 --> 05:54.629
for $500, Mr. Trebek.

05:55.743 --> 05:57.374
Oh, my God.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.061
Kyle.

05:59.087 --> 06:00.595
Hi.

06:03.407 --> 06:05.863
Mmm. I got into Michigan.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.470
- You got off the wait-list?
- Yeah.

06:07.496 --> 06:09.486
- That's amazing.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:09.511 --> 06:11.150
Go, Wolverines!

06:19.716 --> 06:20.902
Whatcha doing?

06:20.927 --> 06:22.966
You're supposed to be in
AP History right now.

06:24.081 --> 06:26.506
You're blocking my sun.

06:26.531 --> 06:28.499
You get one more truancy,
you'll be banned from the prom.

06:28.524 --> 06:30.022
I don't care about prom.

06:30.047 --> 06:33.094
Okay. Who are you... right now?

06:39.878 --> 06:41.329
Well, where are we supposed
to get the stuff, then?

06:41.354 --> 06:43.372
I told you, Kate, I'm
not dealing anymore.

06:43.397 --> 06:45.790
No. We need your hookup.

06:46.433 --> 06:50.086
If you ruin prom, Jasmine
and I will ruin your life.

07:02.039 --> 07:03.798
Stop going through my stuff!

07:03.823 --> 07:05.056
Stop lying to me!

07:05.081 --> 07:06.408
I'm 19!

07:06.433 --> 07:07.615
You're under my roof!

07:08.348 --> 07:09.982
Wait, where are you going?

07:10.007 --> 07:11.111
You said we were gonna
make popcorn and...

07:11.136 --> 07:12.455
I just, I can't breathe
in here anymore, Liz.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.692
It's like a prison.

07:13.856 --> 07:15.130
Well, Mom will be back soon,

07:15.155 --> 07:17.083
and Dad will relax. She
said she'd be here

07:17.108 --> 07:18.191
in time to take me prom dress shopping.

07:18.216 --> 07:18.947
I don't care

07:18.972 --> 07:21.047
if Mom ever comes back, Liz,
and you shouldn't either.

07:21.072 --> 07:22.658
Aren't you tired of trusting her?

07:25.136 --> 07:27.395
Cover for me with the warden.

07:34.315 --> 07:35.761
What are you doing?

07:36.902 --> 07:38.916
Looking at the stars.

07:40.065 --> 07:43.175
I'm so glad you're here.

07:44.811 --> 07:46.355
I had such a crap day.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.615
Oh.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.051
Me, too.

07:50.420 --> 07:52.586
But, hey, it's over now.

07:53.551 --> 07:54.643
Look.

07:56.273 --> 07:58.532
I found my favorite constellation.

07:59.882 --> 08:02.990
It's a man and a serpent.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.333
Maybe the man's killing the serpent.

08:05.599 --> 08:08.376
Maybe the serpent's killing the man.

08:11.361 --> 08:13.804
You can't tell where the man ends

08:14.510 --> 08:16.938
and the snake begins.

08:19.302 --> 08:20.813
What's it called?

08:23.963 --> 08:25.956
Ophiuchus.

from the music room.

12:15.671 --> 12:16.472
Mm-hmm.

12:16.497 --> 12:17.620
Hmm.

12:17.828 --> 12:19.908
You found a different dress?

12:19.933 --> 12:22.919
Sometimes a girl's got to
wear red, Papi. Chill.

12:24.297 --> 12:27.034
<i>Está lindo.</i> You look

12:27.059 --> 12:28.726
so much like your mother.

12:29.807 --> 12:31.559
I was kind of hoping that
she would show up today.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.422
It's okay. We'll show
her the pictures, hmm?

12:40.276 --> 12:41.982
Ooh, one with Rosa, too.

12:43.754 --> 12:45.079
<i>Bonitas.</i>

12:47.596 --> 12:48.868
- All right, get one...
- Oh, yeah.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.638
- Let's do a real one. Oh, yeah.
- Stop. No.

12:50.663 --> 12:52.342
- Want a serious one?
- Just a normal one.

12:52.367 --> 12:53.741
- Hey, normal?
- Serious. Normal serious?

12:53.766 --> 12:55.191
- Yeah.
- Stop.

12:55.216 --> 12:57.060
You guys are the lamest dates ever.

12:57.085 --> 12:58.629
Ugh. Dates just limit your options.

12:58.654 --> 13:00.276
Yeah, well, at least Max
should've asked someone.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.667
You know Tess likes you.

13:01.692 --> 13:03.922
- No, thank you.
- She's cute.

13:03.947 --> 13:06.682
- Hot.
- Nah, I'm good with you guys.

13:06.707 --> 13:09.041
Besides, you know, this
is all almost over.

13:36.668 --> 13:39.582
_

13:44.984 --> 13:46.831
Where the hell you going, Manes?

13:46.856 --> 13:50.123
Huh? What are you so afraid of?

13:53.486 --> 13:54.773
Say it again.

13:54.798 --> 13:56.841
Oh, I don't see what
the big deal is, Alex.

13:57.144 --> 13:59.187
We just have different tastes.

13:59.212 --> 14:03.325
I like tacos, and, well, you like...
hot dogs.

14:03.350 --> 14:05.236
- That's not what you said.
- What did I say?

14:05.261 --> 14:06.720
Kyle!

14:09.172 --> 14:10.295
You know, I just think

14:10.320 --> 14:12.182
you're blowing this whole thing
out of proportion, Manes.

14:12.207 --> 14:13.951
So, what, you don't want Liz to hear

14:13.976 --> 14:15.031
what you called me? You're gonna be

14:15.056 --> 14:16.939
one guy with your friends,
and another with her?

14:16.964 --> 14:19.074
You are a coward. You always have been.

14:19.405 --> 14:22.092
Kyle!

14:23.619 --> 14:25.647
Get off...

14:26.794 --> 14:29.203
You okay?

14:35.994 --> 14:38.087
- Liz, wait.
- Don't follow me.

14:38.112 --> 14:40.382
Alex is right. You need to grow up.

14:49.316 --> 14:50.843
We're closed!

14:52.856 --> 14:54.525
Hey.

14:56.598 --> 14:59.065
Hey? Seriously?

14:59.414 --> 15:00.961
You were such a bitch
to me the other day.

15:00.986 --> 15:03.721
You think you can just come
in here and like, "Hey"?

15:04.703 --> 15:07.067
You don't want your brother to
know that we're friends, do you?

15:07.092 --> 15:08.612
When we first started
hanging out, you said

15:08.637 --> 15:10.008
that you didn't care
about my reputation.

15:10.033 --> 15:11.056
I'm not ashamed of you.

15:11.081 --> 15:13.030
So then why act like you don't know me?

15:14.734 --> 15:16.551
I'm sorry.

15:16.972 --> 15:20.116
I know I've been...
acting weird lately.

15:20.564 --> 15:22.513
I've just been going through a lot.

15:29.938 --> 15:33.187
I wish I could be who I
am with you all the time.

15:40.486 --> 15:42.189
Did prom suck?

15:46.986 --> 15:48.682
I just don't care about those people.

15:48.707 --> 15:50.344
Yeah.

15:52.054 --> 15:53.988
What's the backpack for?

15:54.894 --> 15:57.129
I'm thinking about leaving
town for a while.

15:57.345 --> 15:58.281
There's a guy that says

15:58.306 --> 15:59.828
he thinks he can help me stay clean,

15:59.853 --> 16:01.321
'cause it's been really hard.

16:01.798 --> 16:02.946
What guy?

16:02.971 --> 16:05.226
It's not like a <i> guy</i> guy.

16:05.251 --> 16:08.350
He's more of a... father figure.

16:08.375 --> 16:09.418
He's in recovery, too.

16:09.443 --> 16:11.290
I just feel like I need
a change of scenery.

16:11.315 --> 16:13.042
This town is just suffocating me.

16:13.067 --> 16:15.697
And I was gonna stick around for
Liz, but she's got plans now,

16:15.722 --> 16:17.189
- so...
- So let's leave.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.841
What, you and me?

16:18.866 --> 16:20.755
Yeah, Rosa.

16:23.058 --> 16:25.266
Run away with me instead.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.162
Liz?

16:35.115 --> 16:36.523
Max.

16:37.572 --> 16:39.138
Hi.

16:40.058 --> 16:41.893
Uh, do you want to be alone?

16:49.323 --> 16:52.378
Kyle isn't all that bad, and I see...

16:52.403 --> 16:53.872
I see good in him, honestly.

16:53.897 --> 16:56.328
It's just, he got... football captain

16:56.353 --> 16:58.259
and-and homecoming king.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.237
His ego just... blah.

17:01.532 --> 17:05.509
Well... uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown, I guess.

17:07.323 --> 17:09.273
I'm sure you two will work it out.

17:10.249 --> 17:11.808
No, we won't.

17:13.089 --> 17:14.780
Mm-mm.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.164
I'm sorry you're hurting.

17:20.848 --> 17:22.906
I wasn't crying 'cause of Kyle.

17:23.789 --> 17:26.704
I was crying 'cause I just...

17:26.872 --> 17:28.839
I had a tough day.

17:30.795 --> 17:32.588
And I want my mom.

17:35.314 --> 17:37.520
If she were here, she'd
probably just be...

17:38.905 --> 17:43.787
drunk and selfish.

17:45.853 --> 17:47.787
But I'd still want her here.

17:50.532 --> 17:52.133
Maybe she just thinks I'm...

17:52.383 --> 17:57.302
I'm all grown up, or I can take
care of myself, but I'm not.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.751
I'm just...

18:01.468 --> 18:05.061
I'm not done being taken care of.

18:29.629 --> 18:31.586
Was that Shakespeare?

18:32.740 --> 18:34.570
That thing you said about the crown?

18:36.140 --> 18:39.325
It was <i> Henry IV, Part 2.</i>

18:39.350 --> 18:42.393
You are something else, Max Evans.

18:44.633 --> 18:47.225
Max!

18:47.814 --> 18:50.643
Isobel straight up vanished.

18:52.535 --> 18:54.454
And I have a bad feeling?

18:55.178 --> 18:56.289
Go. Go.

18:56.314 --> 18:57.323
- Seriously.
- You sure?

18:57.348 --> 18:58.859
Maria's on her way. I'm okay.

18:58.884 --> 19:01.168
Okay. Um...

19:05.284 --> 19:06.929
Good night, Liz.

19:22.708 --> 19:23.807
Isobel?

19:24.866 --> 19:26.443
Oh, what the hell?!

19:28.510 --> 19:29.803
- What?
- Wait. Is that...?

19:29.828 --> 19:32.669
No. I-I think it's just paint.

19:35.747 --> 19:37.265
Were you with Rosa?

19:37.290 --> 19:38.164
Are you on something right now?

19:38.189 --> 19:40.328
No. I don't know how I got here.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.403
Stop lying!

19:41.428 --> 19:43.030
That's Rosa's art. We know

19:43.055 --> 19:44.721
she sells drugs. Just
tell us the truth.

19:44.746 --> 19:46.737
You know, my life is none
of your business, Max.

19:46.762 --> 19:47.842
You've made that very clear.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.790
- We just spent all night...
- You're leaving me!

19:50.815 --> 19:52.881
You're going halfway across the planet.
What about me?

19:52.906 --> 19:55.103
- What am I supposed to do?
- Live your life.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.919
Grow up! We're not abandoning you.

19:56.944 --> 19:59.480
You know, I'm sorry I
ruined prom for you guys.

19:59.505 --> 20:01.693
You know what? I can
handle my own problems

20:01.718 --> 20:03.776
by myself, without you.

20:13.935 --> 20:15.935
_

20:24.065 --> 20:25.928
Guerin, relax.

20:25.953 --> 20:27.263
It's just me.

20:27.695 --> 20:29.781
- I was just, uh, hang-hanging out.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:29.806 --> 20:32.190
No, it's fine. It's good that
you've been staying here.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.929
It's cold at night.

20:34.069 --> 20:35.928
Uh, hey, I-I brought you this.

20:35.953 --> 20:38.027
It's, um... it's my brother's.

20:38.052 --> 20:41.012
I don't know. I thought
maybe you'd use it.

20:46.085 --> 20:48.020
Why are you being so nice to me?

20:48.045 --> 20:51.355
People don't always have an agenda.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.360
They can just be nice to each other

20:53.385 --> 20:54.994
for no reason sometimes.

20:55.294 --> 20:57.009
Not in my experience.

21:01.753 --> 21:03.187
Well...

21:03.212 --> 21:05.448
it's the only thing that
makes me feel quiet.

21:07.189 --> 21:09.213
Playing music.

21:10.942 --> 21:12.404
Quiet?

21:13.919 --> 21:15.669
Uh...

21:16.757 --> 21:18.559
Well, I have all this chaos

21:18.892 --> 21:21.664
going on inside me all the time,

21:21.930 --> 21:25.368
and... all I want to do
is get away from myself.

21:26.343 --> 21:28.461
But then I play, and my, uh...

21:29.590 --> 21:31.533
my entropy changes.

21:32.327 --> 21:33.760
Everything goes quiet.

21:38.158 --> 21:40.058
Thank you.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.633
You're welcome.

22:10.606 --> 22:12.048
Rosa?

22:12.179 --> 22:13.571
Not now.

22:13.596 --> 22:15.936
- Who did this?
- It was Kate and Jasmine.

22:15.961 --> 22:17.719
They're pissed that I stopped partying.

22:18.074 --> 22:19.866
Look, I don't... I don't
want Liz to see this, okay?

22:19.891 --> 22:21.775
She said that she needed the
car this afternoon, but...

22:22.076 --> 22:23.525
- Let me help you clean it up.
- No, I'm fine.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.021
I don't need your help.

22:26.917 --> 22:28.814
Did I do something wrong?

22:30.253 --> 22:31.828
I thought Kate Long was my friend,

22:31.853 --> 22:33.785
but I guess I'm just her supplier.

22:35.066 --> 22:36.369
And my mom sucks,

22:36.394 --> 22:39.908
and... Liz is gonna leave, and I
just found out that my dad...

22:44.226 --> 22:45.997
You know, you're just, you're...

22:47.013 --> 22:48.546
you're a lot.

22:49.312 --> 22:50.460
Okay, Izzie, you're just,

22:50.485 --> 22:52.937
you're too much, and I
can't, I can't handle...

23:02.548 --> 23:05.389
I bet Isobel is just smoking
too much pot or something.

23:05.729 --> 23:07.313
I don't get why she's lying.

23:09.509 --> 23:11.628
♪ Into the deep unknown ♪

23:12.454 --> 23:14.028
You remember the camping trip

23:14.465 --> 23:16.099
when she started to
have those blackouts?

23:16.124 --> 23:17.849
You think that's happening again?

23:18.593 --> 23:20.143
Maybe.

23:20.168 --> 23:21.494
I don't know, man, there-there
are these moments

23:21.519 --> 23:24.718
when she's, like... she's not there.

23:25.353 --> 23:27.843
You know? I, I don't know why
she's not talking to us.

23:27.868 --> 23:28.652
She's mad at us

23:28.678 --> 23:30.761
for wanting to leave town;
she has been for a while.

23:30.786 --> 23:32.695
Yeah, I know, but...

23:33.114 --> 23:34.983
I don't know, I might
talk to my parents.

23:35.008 --> 23:35.469
No.

23:35.494 --> 23:37.073
They'll-they'll take her to a doctor.

23:37.098 --> 23:38.643
Scans, tests.

23:38.668 --> 23:39.553
So she wakes up

23:39.578 --> 23:41.743
in weird places sometimes.

23:42.039 --> 23:43.476
Welcome to <i> my</i> life.

23:45.789 --> 23:47.750
Don't worry so much, Max.

23:47.775 --> 23:51.106
You only get to impersonate a
human high school senior once.

23:51.131 --> 23:53.349
I know, I know, you're...
you're probably right, man.

23:53.374 --> 23:55.287
- It's probably just stress.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

23:55.312 --> 23:56.998
I don't know.

23:57.047 --> 23:58.945
And speaking of, uh...

23:58.970 --> 24:01.404
impersonating high school seniors...

24:01.710 --> 24:03.506
I think I might ask Liz out.

24:07.568 --> 24:09.577
Come on, man, we only have this summer,

24:09.602 --> 24:11.480
and then she's gone, you know, and...

24:11.505 --> 24:12.737
Dude, we had a moment.

24:12.762 --> 24:14.731
That's one of those moments that, like,

24:14.756 --> 24:16.806
I feel like it's worth fighting for.

24:17.794 --> 24:19.415
Yeah.

24:19.649 --> 24:21.710
I know those moments.

24:22.089 --> 24:24.181
♪ Into the deep unknown ♪

24:24.500 --> 24:26.175
♪ Like a sinking stone... ♪

24:26.200 --> 24:27.639
No, I need the car, Rosa.

24:27.664 --> 24:29.133
I have to go out to the desert
to collect soil samples

24:29.158 --> 24:30.474
- for AP Bio.
- No, I told you,

24:30.499 --> 24:32.663
- I'm taking it tonight.
- It is for school.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.409
You are two weeks away from graduating.

24:34.434 --> 24:36.714
Would it kill you to do one
thing that isn't perfect?

24:36.828 --> 24:38.472
You know, maybe I wouldn't
have to be so perfect

24:38.497 --> 24:40.089
- if you would...
- If I what?

24:41.943 --> 24:44.686
I just don't want Dad to have
to worry about both of us.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.689
You know what? You are just like Mom.

24:48.714 --> 24:50.114
Nobody matters but you.

24:50.139 --> 24:51.750
I'm nothing like Mom.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.449
I'm here.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.718
Rosa.

24:59.409 --> 25:00.667
Hey.

25:00.692 --> 25:02.760
Um, I could take you.

25:02.987 --> 25:04.564
To the... to the desert.

25:05.441 --> 25:07.560
You know, I have to
do the project, too.

25:10.914 --> 25:12.869
Forget the bio project.

25:13.377 --> 25:15.558
Let's go on an adventure.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.460
Okay.

25:24.796 --> 25:28.030
So, this... this is... this
is your big adventure?

25:28.055 --> 25:29.440
Liz Ortecho would never skip homework

25:29.465 --> 25:31.966
to drink a beer with a boy.

25:32.245 --> 25:33.757
Okay.

25:34.389 --> 25:35.993
Gracias.

25:36.222 --> 25:37.997
So, you got to tell me,

25:38.022 --> 25:39.732
where'd you get the fake?

25:42.177 --> 25:43.603
Rosa.

25:44.607 --> 25:47.406
I almost used it to get into
a Fall Out Boy concert.

25:47.705 --> 25:49.857
Sasha Jimenez.

25:50.361 --> 25:52.091
Age 25.

25:52.116 --> 25:54.230
That's me.

25:54.255 --> 25:55.880
And, uh, you are?

25:55.905 --> 25:57.214
Max Evans.

25:57.372 --> 25:59.504
Fine.

25:59.529 --> 26:03.026
Tell me about yourself,
Max Evans, age 25.

26:03.051 --> 26:04.172
You first.

26:04.197 --> 26:05.517
I...

26:05.696 --> 26:07.282
am a dancer.

26:08.105 --> 26:09.314
Oh.

26:09.339 --> 26:10.831
And, uh, you are?

26:10.856 --> 26:12.601
I am...

26:13.225 --> 26:14.467
a writer.

26:14.492 --> 26:17.285
Oh. I mainly do novels.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.688
Ooh, super pretentious literary novels?

26:19.713 --> 26:21.427
No. No, I...

26:23.190 --> 26:25.957
I want to write something
that you can disappear into.

26:27.031 --> 26:28.933
Something that makes
you feel like home,

26:28.958 --> 26:31.856
you know, that wraps
you up when it's cold.

26:32.193 --> 26:34.076
I bet you're an incredible writer.

26:35.086 --> 26:37.089
I bet you're an incredible dancer.

26:42.305 --> 26:44.927
Come here. I will show you.

26:44.952 --> 26:46.336
Okay.

26:48.766 --> 26:50.065
Hey.

26:51.165 --> 26:52.513
Can we talk?

26:52.538 --> 26:54.194
Uh, yeah. I guess.

26:55.939 --> 26:57.666
Somewhere...

26:58.713 --> 27:00.595
private, maybe?

27:07.498 --> 27:09.511
So, you're gonna step over this one,

27:09.536 --> 27:11.097
so you're going one, two,

27:11.122 --> 27:12.826
- three, just like that.
- But where's the...

27:12.851 --> 27:14.447
Okay. Perfect. So now
we're gonna do it faster.

27:14.472 --> 27:16.191
- Ready? And...
- Okay.

27:16.216 --> 27:17.266
One, two, three...

27:17.291 --> 27:17.980
So it goes...

27:18.005 --> 27:19.917
You would never survive a quinceañera.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.856
Oh, my God.

27:21.881 --> 27:23.725
It's gonna be a beautiful summer night.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.659
For all you lovers out there, next up,

27:25.684 --> 27:26.985
Bright Eyes.

27:31.644 --> 27:33.213
Come on.

27:33.238 --> 27:34.993
I love this song.

27:35.018 --> 27:36.882

It's just, it's too late.

28:53.345 --> 28:54.823
What do you mean, it's too late?
We have all summer.

28:54.848 --> 28:56.508
It's... We don't.

28:56.776 --> 28:58.991
After graduation, I'm
going on a road trip.

28:59.016 --> 29:00.776
You know, I want to see this country.

not with someone that I've liked...

31:00.389 --> 31:01.719
What?

31:01.744 --> 31:03.360
You said you don't want to
be the kind of girl that

31:03.393 --> 31:06.436
changes her plans for a guy, but...

31:06.680 --> 31:10.365
all I've ever wanted was to
change my plans for you.

31:12.815 --> 31:14.649
You'd come on the road trip?

31:15.536 --> 31:17.354
We could kiss by the ocean.

31:18.230 --> 31:19.450
Or at the Grand Canyon.

31:19.475 --> 31:20.581
- Uh-huh.
- Or at the top

31:20.606 --> 31:22.049
of the Empire State Building.

31:22.074 --> 31:23.735
It'll be a perfect summer.

31:34.487 --> 31:36.710
Whew.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.668
Dad.

32:04.553 --> 32:07.243
This ends now.

32:07.394 --> 32:09.031
How dare you?

32:09.056 --> 32:10.447
Under my roof.

32:10.472 --> 32:12.313
Dad, this has nothing to do with you.

32:14.093 --> 32:16.314
Everything you do...

32:16.514 --> 32:19.109
everything.

32:19.134 --> 32:20.016
And I will not

32:20.041 --> 32:22.677
- be humiliated.
- Don't touch him!

32:23.876 --> 32:26.634
No!

32:37.644 --> 32:40.035
Hey. What are you doing here?

32:40.060 --> 32:41.661
- Get away from my car.
- Hey, Rosa.

32:41.686 --> 32:42.932
I just dropped Liz off.

32:42.957 --> 32:44.416
Yeah. Stay away from my sister.

32:44.441 --> 32:45.676
Okay. I-I know you've

32:45.701 --> 32:48.844
- been hanging out with Isobel...
- This is about you.

32:50.079 --> 32:51.969
You're really drunk right now.

32:51.994 --> 32:53.782
Turns out that I do
have a breaking point.

32:53.807 --> 32:54.871
That's not important.

32:54.896 --> 32:56.449
I know what you are, okay?

32:56.474 --> 32:57.101
What?

32:57.126 --> 32:58.545
This town is full of people like you.

32:58.570 --> 33:00.765
Izzie pretended to be my friend.

33:00.790 --> 33:02.978
But she's just a mean girl,
like you're just a dumb boy.

33:03.003 --> 33:04.319
And Liz doesn't need any
of that, all right?

33:04.344 --> 33:06.151
She's gonna leave. She's
gonna be somebody.

33:06.176 --> 33:07.205
It's-it's not like that.

33:07.230 --> 33:08.585
Yeah, she's gonna
forget this small town

33:08.610 --> 33:09.980
and all of its small people.

33:10.037 --> 33:11.817
So just leave us alone.

33:12.870 --> 33:14.344
Go.

33:48.881 --> 33:50.896
Isobel.

34:03.593 --> 34:05.611
Iz. Iz.

34:16.462 --> 34:18.318
Isobel!

34:18.342 --> 34:21.056
Iz! Iz!

34:21.081 --> 34:22.741
Isobel!

34:24.806 --> 34:27.745
But I did it for you.

34:27.770 --> 34:30.335
Everything I did was for you.

34:34.243 --> 34:36.280
What did you do?

34:36.534 --> 34:38.404
She couldn't be trusted.

34:38.429 --> 34:39.565
Isobel!

34:41.190 --> 34:42.905
Oh, my God.

34:43.495 --> 34:47.045
Michael, don't just stand there!

34:48.505 --> 34:50.817
Okay, she's alive. She's alive!

34:50.842 --> 34:52.513
She did it.

34:53.377 --> 34:55.161
I saw her do it, Max.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.078
Rosa.

35:05.802 --> 35:07.835
I think Isobel killed them all.

35:19.588 --> 35:21.470
No, no, no! Please!

35:21.495 --> 35:23.043
Why can't you heal her, Max?

35:23.238 --> 35:25.194
- You got to do something!
- I don't know, man!

35:25.235 --> 35:27.245
I've never brought somebody
back from the dead before!

35:27.270 --> 35:29.557
I'm not strong enough.

35:30.757 --> 35:32.566
We have to get out of here.

35:33.085 --> 35:36.205
We have to, uh, call your parents.

35:36.958 --> 35:38.369
We can call the police.

35:38.394 --> 35:39.911
On Isobel?

35:39.980 --> 35:41.496
This isn't her, man.

35:41.925 --> 35:43.198
Something's not right with her.

35:43.223 --> 35:44.880
She-she wouldn't do this.

35:48.348 --> 35:50.933
We can't just leave the bodies here.

35:51.795 --> 35:53.972
There's evidence everywhere, Max.

35:56.106 --> 35:58.587
It's our fault.

35:58.753 --> 36:00.456
We never should have left her alone.

36:00.481 --> 36:02.935
We, we should have protected her.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.980
So we p... we protect her now.

36:16.493 --> 36:18.992
We cover this up.

36:42.306 --> 36:44.182
Oh, my God.

36:46.799 --> 36:48.532
What happened?

36:51.404 --> 36:53.451
What, you-you don't remember, Isobel?

36:53.555 --> 36:54.988
No.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.568
I, uh...

36:59.537 --> 37:00.914
I messed up, Iz.

37:00.939 --> 37:01.747
What?

37:01.772 --> 37:03.071
Michael.

37:04.498 --> 37:05.691
What are you doing?

37:06.088 --> 37:07.488
How?

37:07.824 --> 37:09.337
I got in a fight.

37:12.801 --> 37:14.567
The jerk, he wrecked my hand.

37:14.871 --> 37:17.588
So I went and I got drunk,
and I ran into those girls.

37:17.613 --> 37:19.458
And my telekinesis, it just went nuts,

37:19.483 --> 37:21.833
like it used to, before
I could control it.

37:22.286 --> 37:24.080
It was an accident, Iz.

37:25.113 --> 37:26.994
Just take my car and
let us handle this.

37:27.019 --> 37:28.520
No.

37:30.834 --> 37:32.624
I'm not leaving you.

38:32.438 --> 38:34.041
Let's go.

38:36.603 --> 38:38.286
No.

38:40.949 --> 38:42.527
It's not enough.

38:46.675 --> 38:50.179
<i>After that night, Michael
and I changed our plans.</i>

38:50.746 --> 38:52.800
<i>He and I stopped hanging out entirely.</i>

38:53.153 --> 38:57.173
<i>We reminded each other of the
worst thing we ever did.</i>

38:58.040 --> 39:00.888
<i>But we kept our eyes
on Isobel for months.</i>

39:00.913 --> 39:02.758
<i>Nothing ever happened again.</i>

39:03.268 --> 39:07.929
<i>We had so many questions,
but we never asked them.</i>

39:07.954 --> 39:10.341
<i>We were too busy trying to forget.</i>

39:33.335 --> 39:35.620
And you don't know why she did it.

39:35.645 --> 39:37.139
No.

39:37.878 --> 39:39.696
We never understood it.

39:46.215 --> 39:47.842
I don't understand.

39:48.422 --> 39:49.534
Why?

39:49.559 --> 39:52.262
You're never gonna understand,
because it wasn't you.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.681
It was me! You saw it!

39:57.706 --> 39:58.983
No! When I found you, when I found you

39:59.008 --> 40:00.607
with your hand on her...

40:01.295 --> 40:02.832
the way that you looked
at me, it was like

40:02.857 --> 40:04.379
you were a different person.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.821
You did this.

40:06.103 --> 40:07.782
Look at my sister.

40:07.807 --> 40:09.558
I know. I see her every
time I close my eyes.

40:09.583 --> 40:10.253
You let

40:10.278 --> 40:14.371
our entire town think that
she killed Jasmine and Kate.

40:14.953 --> 40:16.761
<i>Is that what we are,</i>

40:16.786 --> 40:18.336
killers?

40:19.992 --> 40:22.719
Max killed that guy in the desert.

40:22.744 --> 40:24.611
And I-I...

40:27.608 --> 40:29.250
In our DNA?

40:29.461 --> 40:30.871
Are we just some type

40:30.896 --> 40:33.449
of murderous species, and our-our ship

40:33.474 --> 40:35.239
came in here to hurt people?

40:35.446 --> 40:36.878
We don't know where we came from.

40:36.903 --> 40:38.565
We don't know what we are.

40:38.590 --> 40:40.555
For ten years,

40:40.580 --> 40:42.591
people terrorized my family.

40:42.616 --> 40:43.843
You made us

40:43.868 --> 40:45.150
a target.

40:45.175 --> 40:47.198
You made me a target.

40:47.223 --> 40:48.993
I didn't know that was
gonna happen, okay?

40:49.018 --> 40:50.063
I-I was scared.

40:50.088 --> 40:51.204
I was a stupid kid.

40:51.229 --> 40:52.895
You were not stupid, Max!

40:53.142 --> 40:54.620
You were brilliant!

40:54.645 --> 40:57.002
You were 17, and you

40:57.027 --> 40:59.646
covered up a murder for ten years.
I mean,

40:59.671 --> 41:01.113
- it's incredible!
- Liz...

41:01.138 --> 41:02.196
No! Don't...

41:02.221 --> 41:04.308
I wanted to tell you.
I-I came to find you

41:04.333 --> 41:07.217
a few days later, and you were saying
goodbye to your family. You drove away.

41:07.839 --> 41:12.113
I haven't had one of these
blackouts since that night.

41:12.697 --> 41:14.521
Until now.

41:15.159 --> 41:17.462
That means it's starting again.

41:17.487 --> 41:19.055
That means I'm dangerous.

41:20.562 --> 41:23.162
We've lived for ten years
in a comfortable lie.

41:26.021 --> 41:28.441
It's time to face the truth now.

41:29.157 --> 41:30.428
Hmm?

41:31.317 --> 41:34.721
You destroyed my sister...

41:34.746 --> 41:36.792
to save yours!

41:37.731 --> 41:39.762
I never want to see you again,

41:39.787 --> 41:41.499
Max Evans.
