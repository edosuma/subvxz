Can you kill?

00:13.960 --> 00:15.450
You know
why he didn't come, don't you?

00:15.560 --> 00:16.561
My bloody man.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.450
There was a fire at his restaurant.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.847
No fraternizing with the foreigners.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.769
There's a cavalry officer.

They said the Peaky Blinders
had business with me.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.681
So,

what is it you want
from a simple working man?

02:18.720 --> 02:19.801
Fear.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.082
Poor Mr Nutley drank too much.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.326
He went for a piss on the train tracks
that run behind the factory.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.280
Train came.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.687
They found his body in Saltley

Both.

Perhaps you know them
as the, uh, Economic League.

Only once did I get a letter from them
headed "The Vigilance Committee."

Since the election, the government

is save the country from revolution.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.881
Are you political, Mr Shelby?

06:56.280 --> 06:57.611
Because these Odd Fellows believe

06:57.680 --> 07:01.207
that the time is coming soon
when everyone must choose a side.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.647
Are your people coming
or are they not coming?

07:06.280 --> 07:09.489
Mr Shelby, you will learn that
these men are far too grand

07:09.560 --> 07:11.289
for the clock to govern them.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.923

He'll probably want to become a trustee.

Perhaps Admiral Hall's been held up
at the House of Lords.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.805
Am I impressing you?

Thank you,
I'm surprised you weren't invited.

50:45.040 --> 50:46.929
Now, how would that look, eh?

50:48.600 --> 50:51.490
Oh, now, the party has really started.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.721
Who are they?

50:52.880 --> 50:56.601
DANIEL: Father John Hughes
from St Mary's Boys Reformatory.

50:56.680 --> 50:59.889
And with him is Mr Patrickjarvis, MP.

50:59.960 --> 51:04.807
They are part of an organisation
called the Economic League.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.609
Did you invite them, Grace?

51:06.800 --> 51:08.290
Their names sound familiar.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.003
They were recommended by the Lord Mayor.

51:11.080 --> 51:14.289
Oh. On your
"best people of the city" list, eh?

51:14.480 --> 51:16.847
- GRACE: Do you know them?
- I'll introduce you, Tommy.

51:16.920 --> 51:20.322
That's all right, Danny.
I'll introduce myself.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.006
We appear to have taken you by surprise.

51:37.520 --> 51:39.170
I have adjusted.

51:40.760 --> 51:43.047
Since the socialists
got into Downing Street

51:43.120 --> 51:44.326
we are all being followed.

51:44.400 --> 51:46.687
We have to meet in places
where we'd meet anyway.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.091
You should have stopped by Small Heath.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.049
I could have given you
a more traditional welcome.

51:50.120 --> 51:53.647
- They want to know about ammunition.
- PATRICK: And chains for the wheels.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.200
When the White Guard
make their run for Tbilisi,

51:56.280 --> 51:57.884
it will be over rough terrain.

51:58.120 --> 52:01.647
(IN HALES SHARPLY) The chains are
suitable for snow or wet ground.

52:01.720 --> 52:03.529
They're already stored on the vehicles.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.489
There's a batch of weapons
set aside at the BSA,

52:05.560 --> 52:07.324
which is bound for the Turkish army.

52:07.640 --> 52:09.927
And how will you get it all aboard
the London train?

52:10.000 --> 52:12.241
There will be a strike that night
across the city.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.571
You will have to stop
the train twice. How?

52:16.360 --> 52:19.250
Two drivers willjoin the strike
at different points.

52:20.960 --> 52:26.251
Rather fun, getting the Communist unions
to help get weapons to the Whites.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.845
TOMMY: Yes, rather fun, eh?

52:29.200 --> 52:31.362
I am thinking ahead,
thinking of every possibility,

52:31.440 --> 52:33.249
remembering everything
that is happening.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.691
(PATRICK SCOFFS)

52:36.240 --> 52:38.561
The Russians want to inspect
the vehicles.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.361
- I'll take photographs.
- PATRICK: Mmm-mmm.

52:42.440 --> 52:45.489
The Duke has sent his niece, she's here.

52:46.400 --> 52:49.131
Tomorrow you will take her to the
factory and show her.

52:49.200 --> 52:52.886
No. Union conveners
are watching the factories.

52:54.760 --> 52:55.807
Not possible.

52:57.080 --> 53:00.209
Anything is possible, Mr Shelby.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.964
You will take her.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.321
You will pick her up
from this hotel at ten.

53:06.840 --> 53:09.650
Now, look, a priest with an empty glass.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.162
Let's get back to the party.

53:15.120 --> 53:20.160
You know, gentlemen, there is hell
and there is another place below hell.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.008
I will remember everything...

53:24.920 --> 53:26.649
And forget nothing.

53:31.320 --> 53:33.288
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

53:36.320 --> 53:37.606
GRACE: Tommy,

53:37.680 --> 53:39.887
this is Duchess Tatiana Petrovna.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.371
(CLEARS TH ROAT)

53:41.440 --> 53:43.602
Come on, Tommy, aren't you impressed
to meet a real duchess?

53:43.800 --> 53:45.723
Well, I understand they charge a fee.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.725
(SCOFFS) Mr Shelby,
you are very direct.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.086
Too direct.

53:50.160 --> 53:51.366
TATIANA: (CHUCKLES) But it's true.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.321
I attend these things for the champagne.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.881
And for the chance
to be treated like a duchess again.

53:57.240 --> 53:59.925
You should have kissed my hand,
Mr Shelby.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.525
Forgive me.

54:05.960 --> 54:07.724
She was asking about my sapphire.

54:07.800 --> 54:10.804
- I thought I recognised it.
- She said it was Russian.

54:10.880 --> 54:13.770
My husband has business in Russia.
Perhaps you know about it, Tatiana?

54:13.840 --> 54:15.649
Well, tonight is not a night
for business, eh?

54:15.720 --> 54:17.688
Is that why you were in the concert hall
for 10 minutes?

54:17.760 --> 54:19.046
I think people are ready
for dinner now, Grace.

54:19.240 --> 54:21.322
No, no. I'm not done
pumping people for money.

54:21.520 --> 54:22.931
What is "pump for money"?

54:23.080 --> 54:25.048
It's what I do every day.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.404
You know each other, do you?

54:28.360 --> 54:30.408
You see, I am in charge
of compiling the list of guests,

54:30.480 --> 54:32.767
but it's my husband
who seems to know all of them.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.365
I hear he is very well connected.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.329
And where does a duchess hear that?

54:36.480 --> 54:37.527
In certain circles.

54:37.600 --> 54:38.840
All right, enough. Ada.

54:38.960 --> 54:40.530
Grace, there's a Lady Dowager

54:40.600 --> 54:42.648
who wants to speak to you
about coffee mornings.

54:42.720 --> 54:44.961
She mentioned a £2,000 cash donation.

54:45.120 --> 54:47.248
Tatiana, you and I will speak later.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.845
TATIANA: I would like that.

54:51.080 --> 54:53.242
Going to the factory tomorrow
is a mistake.

54:54.280 --> 54:55.964
Nevertheless, we will go.

54:57.360 --> 55:00.682
Also, my uncle ordered me to seduce you
to give us an advantage.

55:00.760 --> 55:03.286
But with a beautiful wife like that
it will be difficult, no?

55:03.360 --> 55:04.850
Tomorrow is a mistake.

55:05.200 --> 55:07.680
Have you not heard?
We have no morals, we Russians.

55:07.880 --> 55:08.961
And no fucking sense.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.565
And no options.

55:11.040 --> 55:14.283
I would fuck you for the cause.
What do you think of that?

55:15.320 --> 55:17.527
I think you should not drink
vodka with champagne.

55:18.960 --> 55:21.327
TATIANA: Does your wife know
that the sapphire she is wearing

55:21.400 --> 55:23.448
has been cursed by a Gypsy?

55:24.440 --> 55:26.010
(CHUCKLING)

55:27.640 --> 55:28.641
What did you say?

55:29.040 --> 55:32.169
Nothing on Earth would make me wear it.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.162
Grace, listen to me.
Look, I can explain.

55:49.360 --> 55:50.361
- Go away.
- It's...

55:50.440 --> 55:51.646
MC: Ladies and gentlemen.

55:51.720 --> 55:52.881
For once, you shouldn't have to explain.

55:52.960 --> 55:56.328
The loyalty toast,
to His Majesty the King.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.204
ALL: To the King.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.125
MC: Dinner is served.

56:00.320 --> 56:02.368
TOMMY: You look beautiful,
but you need to take this off.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.010
Why? Because you think
it would look better on her?

56:04.080 --> 56:06.811
Grace, look at me,
fuck these people, eh.

56:06.880 --> 56:09.963
Fuck 'em, I need you to be all right.

56:10.280 --> 56:13.762
I need you, Grace. I need you.

56:21.080 --> 56:23.321
Damn you, Tommy Shelby. (CHUCKLES)

56:34.680 --> 56:36.170
(CHUCKLES)

56:36.240 --> 56:37.765
- Shall we go inside?
- Yeah.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.325
For Angel!

56:43.840 --> 56:45.001
(GUNSHOT)

56:45.200 --> 56:47.123
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

56:55.640 --> 56:58.883
Get me a fucking ambulance now!
