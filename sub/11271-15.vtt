WEBVTT

00:03.765 --> 00:07.101
AND COACHIE MAKES THREE

00:15.861 --> 00:21.867
Cliffie, don't look now, but there are two
chicks at the end of the bar staring at us.

00:22.034 --> 00:23.869
You're crazy.

00:24.036 --> 00:27.457
They been staring for 20 minutes.
Do we look weird?

00:27.624 --> 00:29.667
- You do.
- Why?

00:29.834 --> 00:33.755
Cos you're talking
out of the side of your mouth.

00:36.549 --> 00:39.761
They can't take their eyes off us.

00:42.932 --> 00:47.478
There's only one way to be sure.
Toodle down the end of the bar

00:47.645 --> 00:50.189
and see if their eyes follow us.

00:53.067 --> 00:55.778
So are they looking?

00:59.448 --> 01:04.078
I'd say those supple young petunias
definitely want us.

01:05.497 --> 01:10.710
- So what do we do now?
- Just take a walk over there.

01:10.877 --> 01:12.921
I will if you will.

01:16.591 --> 01:20.555
On second thoughts,
why don't we play it cooI?

01:20.721 --> 01:26.102
- We let them come to us.
- Those babes are really hot for us.

01:26.269 --> 01:31.899
- That's it, folks. Closing time.
- Here they come, moving in for the kill.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.407
Excuse me.

01:38.574 --> 01:43.704
My friend and I were wondering
if you knew a late-night spot to go to.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.331
Some place a little fun.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.141 --> 02:05.184
What was that?

02:10.524 --> 02:13.235
These guys are Martians.

02:13.402 --> 02:16.697
- Come on. They're nerds.
- Their loss.

03:40.828 --> 03:45.123
Well, they've gone now.
You can turn off the charm.

03:46.834 --> 03:49.461
You were a reaI smoothy yourself.

03:49.628 --> 03:53.341
Listen to Cary Grant.
That was humiliating.

03:53.508 --> 03:56.511
What difference does it make?

03:56.678 --> 04:00.139
They weren't that good-looking anyway.

04:00.306 --> 04:05.395
Absolutely. We almost took the
midnight train to Bow-Wow City.

04:05.562 --> 04:09.567
You're right.
I've seen better legs on a pooI table.

04:09.733 --> 04:12.987
You could use that chest
for a straightedge.

04:13.153 --> 04:18.242
- Put a bag over your head.
- Or a gunny sack. It'll cover more.

04:37.721 --> 04:40.557
Great eats, Diane. Thanks.

04:40.724 --> 04:43.978
<i>Did you enjoy your rognons
de veau aux chanterelles?</i>

04:47.690 --> 04:50.026
Was that the green stuff?

04:51.694 --> 04:54.655
No. That was the brown stuff.

04:54.822 --> 04:58.618
Good. That green stuff
kind of repeats on you.

05:00.495 --> 05:03.915
- I'm dreadfully sorry.
- Quite all right.

05:07.169 --> 05:12.132
Well, I am gonna check some scores out
on the tube here, I think.

05:14.426 --> 05:18.431
You know, I went to a lot of trouble
with this meaI.

05:18.598 --> 05:20.391
So did I.

05:21.934 --> 05:25.855
I'm joking. It was wonderfuI.
Thank you very much.

05:26.022 --> 05:29.150
It's a pleasure to cook for a gourmand.

05:34.073 --> 05:38.243
- Sam, what's happening to us?
- Are you repeating too?

05:42.915 --> 05:46.418
A little,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

05:46.585 --> 05:49.296
We're becoming humdrum. Routine.

05:49.463 --> 05:54.344
I tell you what. After my meaI
settles here, I'll attack you.

05:55.887 --> 05:59.808
Well, you may be in the mood
earlier than you think.

05:59.974 --> 06:05.730
Make yourself comfortable. I'll take care
of something in the other room.

06:09.068 --> 06:12.029
- Who's there?
- Me. Who's there?

06:14.865 --> 06:17.701
- Coach?
- No, I'm Coach.

06:22.331 --> 06:26.586
- What are you doing here, Coach?
- At least we got that straight.

06:26.753 --> 06:31.508
We almost had the most incredible
disaster. Look at this TV guide.

06:33.385 --> 06:35.428
"Thunder Road".

06:35.595 --> 06:41.602
Mitchum. We haven't missed a Mitchum
movie together in over 12 years.

06:41.769 --> 06:46.858
- We don't wanna miss the beginning.
- Mitchum won't start without us.

06:47.942 --> 06:51.696
- We're gonna need munchies.
- Diane's got some.

06:51.863 --> 06:58.244
While you're up, turn down the lights.
There's a terrible glare on the screen.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.348
Take me, you barbarian.

07:21.311 --> 07:24.063
You're gonna miss "Thunder Road".

07:27.108 --> 07:32.071
- What happened?
- Nothing yet. They're going up the road.

07:32.238 --> 07:35.784
No, with Diane.
Hey, Diane, you all right?

07:39.663 --> 07:41.957
What is Coach doing here?

07:42.124 --> 07:47.880
He's watching "Thunder Road". We
always watch Mitchum movies together.

07:48.964 --> 07:51.635
It's a bad time right now.

07:51.801 --> 07:56.348
I know, but it's a tradition
that goes back with us for years.

07:56.514 --> 08:00.560
He's our favourite actor.
Never do we miss his movies.

08:00.727 --> 08:05.982
I came out of the bedroom and I was so
embarrassed with how I was dressed.

08:06.149 --> 08:09.737
Come in here. I'll show you what I mean.
Come on.

08:10.863 --> 08:12.907
Coach, scram. Out.

08:13.074 --> 08:15.117
What?

08:17.870 --> 08:20.331
- What's wrong?
- Sam.

08:21.540 --> 08:25.170
- A little tact.
- I'm sorry. Coach, listen.

08:25.337 --> 08:27.381
What?

08:27.547 --> 08:31.426
Diane and I had this speciaI evening
going here.

08:32.385 --> 08:36.722
She just fixed me a meaI
with all my favourite colours.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.476
Changed into something frilly.

08:39.643 --> 08:43.356
And I come barging in.
I wasn't even thinking.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.485
Diane, forgive me. I never
wanted to get in your way.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.779
Thank you for understanding.

08:49.946 --> 08:54.659
When you live alone,
you forget other people have lives.

09:00.916 --> 09:06.713
- Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
- Yeah. Poor Coach.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.093
We have so many hours together,

09:11.260 --> 09:15.890
I guess it's kind of selfish
not to spend a little time with him.

09:16.057 --> 09:21.062
- You're right. I'll get him.
- Bet you can catch him on the steps.

09:23.314 --> 09:27.735
- Why are you standing there?
- My coat got caught in the door.

09:28.820 --> 09:33.367
I didn't have the heart
to bother you again. Good night.

09:35.202 --> 09:37.663
No, Coach, come here. Listen.

09:37.830 --> 09:41.542
You are gonna watch "Thunder Road"
with us. Sit down.

09:41.709 --> 09:44.753
- You mean it?
- You bet. Come on over.

09:44.920 --> 09:48.007
I've never seen it.
Tell me what's happened.

09:48.174 --> 09:53.138
I know every line in this picture.
Here's my favourite part.

10:00.228 --> 10:04.441
When I'm in charge of the bar,
I know what God feels like.

10:04.608 --> 10:09.030
- How's that?
- I'm in controI of people's destinies.

10:09.196 --> 10:13.200
I can make their drinks too strong
so they get sick.

10:13.367 --> 10:18.205
Or I can water them down
so they pay for nothing.

10:18.372 --> 10:21.834
Or if I don't like their attitudes,
I can spit in it.

10:30.052 --> 10:34.306
You're not still upset about that argument
we had the other day?

10:34.473 --> 10:36.516
You tell me.

10:49.238 --> 10:54.494
I'm sorry about this morning
when I called you a sawed-off witch.

11:07.049 --> 11:13.055
I'm Sam Malone. Maybe you remember
me before we became a threesome.

11:13.222 --> 11:15.266
Yes, I recognise you now.

11:15.433 --> 11:18.937
- You shaved off your Pantusso.
- That's it.

11:22.148 --> 11:25.235
- I know.
- I can't take it any more.

11:25.402 --> 11:31.199
- We never go anyplace without Coach.
- I don't invite him. He just shows up.

11:31.366 --> 11:36.080
- What are we gonna do?
- Right now, we're gonna sit in my office.

11:36.247 --> 11:40.876
We're gonna look into
each other's eyes, all alone.

11:41.043 --> 11:43.087
That sounds so wonderfuI.

11:43.254 --> 11:45.506
Where have you been?

11:45.673 --> 11:51.138
Coach, I'm sorry. I overslept.
We were up late last night watching...

11:51.304 --> 11:56.685
- "Mothra Versus Godzilla".
- Was I disappointed in that.

11:58.311 --> 12:05.318
We've got to draw the line. No way
can we spend the evening with Coach.

12:05.485 --> 12:08.114
You're absolutely right.

12:08.281 --> 12:11.576
Are we gonna get together tonight?

12:11.742 --> 12:15.621
- You bet.
- Great.

12:17.874 --> 12:22.128
All right. There's only one solution
to this problem.

12:22.295 --> 12:26.925
We have to tell the Coach
to stop hanging around with us.

12:27.092 --> 12:33.891
Diane's right. Tell Coach you don't want
him around. That's the honest approach.

12:34.057 --> 12:39.229
Or to make it easier on Coach, rip out
his heart and do a tap-dance on it.

12:41.107 --> 12:43.318
- I got it here.
- What?

12:43.484 --> 12:46.487
Make him think you got a bad disease.

12:46.654 --> 12:51.659
Get reaI skinny, and you paint
your faces white and pasty.

12:51.826 --> 12:55.246
Walk around looking like
you're gonna throw up.

12:55.413 --> 12:59.501
You'd better hurry up.
Diane's got a head start.

13:08.010 --> 13:12.973
Coach likes you guys. Take him
off our hands for tonight, please.

13:13.140 --> 13:17.938
We don't want Coach getting in
the way when we're hustling chicks.

13:18.104 --> 13:20.190
Sorry I asked.

13:20.357 --> 13:27.530
It's against my beliefs to help things go
smoothly with the squawk box there,

13:27.697 --> 13:31.452
but since Coach is involved,
I'm gonna bend the rules.

13:31.619 --> 13:35.164
I know he has a crush
on a teller at his bank.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.752
- Are you sure?
- He talks about her a lot.

13:39.919 --> 13:44.090
I don't know her name,
but she could take him off your hands.

13:44.256 --> 13:47.969
That's good. What do you say?
It's worth a try.

13:48.135 --> 13:51.932
I think Coach would be
embarrassed by a blind date.

13:52.099 --> 13:57.354
We'll pretend she's my friend
and it'II look like a chance meeting.

13:57.521 --> 14:01.233
Coach,
maybe you can help me out here.

14:01.400 --> 14:07.657
- I want a new bank. You like yours?
- I love it. Bay Harbor Savings and Loan.

14:07.824 --> 14:11.202
- Do you like the tellers?
- They're terrific.

14:11.369 --> 14:15.999
Is there one I should talk to?
Friendly, nice, cute?

14:16.165 --> 14:18.209
Frank.

14:18.376 --> 14:21.379
Who's the one you always talk to?

14:21.546 --> 14:24.633
Redhead with a nice smile
who always winks?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.844
- Yeah.
- That's Frank.

14:28.345 --> 14:32.933
Isn't there a woman
that you like at the bank there?

14:35.352 --> 14:36.770
Edwina.

14:36.937 --> 14:40.024
Edwina at Bay Harbor
Savings and Loan?

14:40.191 --> 14:44.279
- She's a friend of mine.
- Then you should know Frank.

14:44.446 --> 14:46.364
They're married.

14:46.531 --> 14:52.537
No. Who's the one you said
was a nice lady last Thursday?

14:52.704 --> 14:56.541
- Thursday. Stella.
- Stella. That's my friend.

14:56.708 --> 15:00.421
No, not Stella.
I'm not too crazy about Stella.

15:00.588 --> 15:03.924
- I meant Dorothy.
- Yes, so did I.

15:05.009 --> 15:09.138
- Dorothy is the one you like, right?
- She's very nice.

15:09.305 --> 15:10.723
Excuse me.

15:13.184 --> 15:16.438
But not as nice as Julia.

15:18.648 --> 15:23.862
That's the grocery store.
At the bank, nobody beats Sandra.

15:24.029 --> 15:26.072
Sandra. That's my friend.

15:30.744 --> 15:33.706
- What is it?
- Not Sandra, it's Anita.

15:33.873 --> 15:35.917
I'll take this.

15:41.672 --> 15:45.426
- Wrong girI, Coach?
- No. Wrong bank.

16:01.536 --> 16:04.956
Well, Katherine,
didn't you love that meaI?

16:05.123 --> 16:07.459
It was very nice.

16:07.626 --> 16:10.045
I'm glad we had Coach along.

16:10.212 --> 16:14.466
An Italian knows what to order
in an Italian restaurant.

16:14.633 --> 16:17.678
It was wonderfuI.
What was that dish called?

16:17.845 --> 16:23.309
Spaghetti for four. They've got a better
one, though, spaghetti for six,

16:23.476 --> 16:25.520
but you need more people.

16:27.355 --> 16:30.817
I'll make coffee.
Make yourselves at home.

16:30.984 --> 16:33.027
There you go.

16:40.411 --> 16:45.499
You know something? I can't get over
the fact Diane knew Katherine,

16:45.666 --> 16:48.919
my favourite teller at First Fidelity.

16:49.086 --> 16:52.506
Well, it's a small world, I guess, Coach.

16:52.673 --> 16:57.137
And she seems to know everybody
in every bank I've dealt with.

16:57.304 --> 16:59.514
You know how friendly she is.

16:59.681 --> 17:04.060
How did you and Katherine
come to meet?

17:04.227 --> 17:06.396
- The loan desk.
- The drop...

17:06.563 --> 17:12.694
That's all right, honey. Sometimes
I forget things too. Or do I?

17:12.861 --> 17:16.574
Coach, you tickle me.
Are you always this funny?

17:16.741 --> 17:18.784
I doubt it.

17:24.290 --> 17:30.087
So, Katherine, what's new and exciting
in the world of high finance?

17:30.254 --> 17:33.884
Nothing that I know of.
My most exciting moment

17:34.051 --> 17:38.513
is catching someone playing
with their lips on closed circuit TV.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.891
I knew you looked familiar.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.854
Hang on a moment.

17:47.272 --> 17:51.110
Well, I think banking is fascinating.

17:51.277 --> 17:55.990
There are so many facets.
So many things I've wondered about.

17:56.157 --> 17:58.785
- Me too, you know?
- Like what?

17:58.951 --> 18:03.748
Tellers never tell you anything.
They always ask questions.

18:03.915 --> 18:08.504
There's nothing interesting
about interest. It's boring.

18:08.671 --> 18:14.009
The trust department have pens chained
to tables. What kind of trust is that?

18:14.176 --> 18:20.057
- There he goes again. You're too much.
- A little giddy, but nice.

18:22.060 --> 18:26.106
Look at the time. I've got to get up
at the crack of dawn.

18:26.272 --> 18:30.652
What a wonderfuI evening.
I'll take a rain check on coffee.

18:30.819 --> 18:35.031
It is getting kinda late.
Can I see you get home OK?

18:35.198 --> 18:39.662
Thanks. I'd like that.
Good night, Diane. Thank you.

18:39.829 --> 18:42.790
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night.

18:42.957 --> 18:46.669
- Good night. We'll do it again.
- Absolutely.

18:50.214 --> 18:55.845
This shows that sticky situations are
best handled with lies and trickery.

18:57.013 --> 19:00.392
And now for a little romance.

19:04.062 --> 19:06.106
A little hug.

19:07.357 --> 19:09.985
A little kiss.

19:11.236 --> 19:14.115
- A little Coach.
- Excuse me.

19:15.199 --> 19:18.411
I thought you were
gonna show Katherine home.

19:18.578 --> 19:21.372
I showed her where the bus stop is.

19:23.207 --> 19:27.211
You probably didn't notice,
but she had the hots for me.

19:27.378 --> 19:29.297
What's wrong with that?

19:29.463 --> 19:35.762
She's nice, but she doesn't fit in with us.
Like a fourth wheeI. I need cookies.

19:42.352 --> 19:46.064
- What do we do now?
- It's time to tell the truth.

19:46.231 --> 19:49.319
- Good.
- I'll handle this.

19:49.485 --> 19:53.198
- Coach, get out here.
- Want one?

19:53.364 --> 19:55.825
No. Listen.

19:57.994 --> 20:03.499
I'm gonna tell you something, and
I don't care if it hurts your feelings.

20:03.666 --> 20:05.836
What is it?

20:06.003 --> 20:10.007
Diane doesn't want you
hanging around us any more.

20:10.174 --> 20:16.931
What? That's not true. Sam doesn't want
you around. I love having you around.

20:17.097 --> 20:22.103
I love having him around more than you.
I'd rather have him around than you.

20:22.270 --> 20:25.857
- Well, fine.
- Don't sneak around me like this.

20:26.024 --> 20:30.612
All right. Please stop.
Kids, hold on, please.

20:30.779 --> 20:33.740
I'm beginning to see the light here.

20:33.907 --> 20:38.161
- You don't have the guts to tell me.
- I do, Diane doesn't.

20:38.328 --> 20:40.373
What is it? Say it.

20:41.582 --> 20:43.626
Come on. Say it.

20:45.586 --> 20:50.216
When you were a drunk and nobody
told you, I told you, didn't I?

20:50.383 --> 20:53.803
- Over and over again.
- You really were a drunk.

20:53.970 --> 20:56.014
I know.

20:56.181 --> 21:00.060
- I mean, you were really a drunk.
- Don't start again.

21:00.268 --> 21:06.191
Is our friendship so weak that we can't
come out tell each other the truth?

21:09.277 --> 21:11.822
You're right.

21:11.988 --> 21:15.910
We just don't want you
hanging around us so much.

21:21.124 --> 21:24.711
If you don't want me, it's fine.
I'm not mad.

21:24.877 --> 21:29.674
It's fine. I'll see you.

21:32.469 --> 21:34.513
But you really were a drunk.

21:50.697 --> 21:53.950
- Morning, Norm.
- Where the heck have you been?

21:54.117 --> 21:58.663
- Is my watch fast?
- Sorry. We had a difficult evening.

21:58.830 --> 22:03.209
We had to tell Coach
we didn't want to see him any more.

22:03.376 --> 22:06.255
It was terrible. Worse than we feared.

22:06.422 --> 22:10.134
We spent half the night arguing
about who was to blame.

22:18.767 --> 22:22.814
- Morning, everybody.
- How are you today, Norman?

22:22.981 --> 22:25.025
As if you cared.

22:25.192 --> 22:28.945
Coach didn't take well
to getting the old heave-ho.

22:29.112 --> 22:31.781
He was destroyed. He tried to cover,

22:31.948 --> 22:36.745
but there was no masking the pain
Sam inflicted on his deepest being.

22:36.912 --> 22:40.291
Don't start again.
You did most of the talking.

22:42.543 --> 22:48.925
What difference does it make who did it?
The point is Coach has been crushed.

22:49.091 --> 22:51.135
We have to live with that.

22:52.053 --> 22:54.096
Especially you.

22:54.263 --> 22:58.518
- It was your idea. You insisted.
- That's the most...

22:58.685 --> 23:02.439
Listen. I wanna know
which one of you two kids

23:02.606 --> 23:05.859
got the idea to throw me out last night.

23:06.026 --> 23:09.238
Come on. I wanna know right now.

23:09.404 --> 23:14.160
Come on. What difference does it make
whose fault it was?

23:14.327 --> 23:17.455
It's done.
We both have to share the blame.

23:19.332 --> 23:25.171
Yes, the important thing is
that we showed you our feelings.

23:25.338 --> 23:31.887
- Honesty was our only recourse.
- Absolutely. It was a mutuaI decision.

23:34.723 --> 23:39.144
Whoever it was, I wanna thank
them from the bottom of my heart.

23:39.311 --> 23:43.065
Because I caught up with Katherine
at the bus stop

23:43.232 --> 23:48.905
and I took her home, got to know her
and she's the most wonderfuI woman.

23:49.072 --> 23:51.825
I haven't been this happy in years.

23:51.992 --> 23:55.829
That's wonderfuI.
You don't know how happy we are.

23:55.996 --> 24:01.793
And the fact that we had anything to do
with it makes this feeI even better.

24:01.960 --> 24:07.842
Absolutely. Just think of it as the two of
us being able to do something for you.

24:11.262 --> 24:14.807
Say, Normie,
aren't they a wonderfuI couple?

24:52.555 --> 24:53.556
English

24:54.305 --> 25:00.253
