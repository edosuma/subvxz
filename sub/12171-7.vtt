- or did something happen?

07:27.125 --> 07:28.917
that weren't positive

07:28.958 --> 07:30.624
when you were honing them,

07:30.625 --> 07:33.042
but pay off later on.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.542
- Where's the wedding,
- so we can get an idea

07:34.583 --> 07:35.958
- of what type of...
- It's in palm Springs.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.208
For example,

07:37.250 --> 07:38.457
you used to sneak around

07:38.458 --> 07:39.750
on your man

07:39.792 --> 07:41.250
and didn't get caught.

07:41.292 --> 07:42.457
- I love that pink interior.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.124
- The interior's bomb.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.292
Those skills may come in handy

07:46.333 --> 07:47.479
when you're planning

07:47.480 --> 07:48.625
a surprise wedding

07:48.667 --> 07:49.750
and you have to do

07:49.751 --> 07:50.832
lots of things,

07:50.833 --> 07:51.999
like get fitted

07:52.000 --> 07:53.583
for a wedding outfit.

07:53.625 --> 07:54.667
- Can I...
- You guys wanna take a look

07:54.670 --> 07:55.792
- at some of the fabrics?
- Yeah.

07:55.833 --> 07:58.000
That's the positive part

07:58.042 --> 07:59.999
of being a former ho.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.167
I was thinking

08:01.168 --> 08:02.332
like, maybe a pink,

08:02.333 --> 08:03.583
a tan, a gray.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.833
- Yes.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.666
- I'm very much vibing

08:06.667 --> 08:07.792
- the stripity number.
- Okay.

08:07.833 --> 08:08.917
- It's gorgeous.
- Yeah.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.000
- Well, let's talk
- about the styling.

08:10.003 --> 08:11.125
Do you like double-breasted?

08:11.167 --> 08:12.167
- No.
- Single-breasted?

08:12.170 --> 08:14.125
- Double-breasted
- is not cute on me.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.292
I'm gonna look like

08:15.333 --> 08:16.833
a cardboard box.

08:18.833 --> 08:19.833
- Hi.
- Hey,

08:19.836 --> 08:21.167
- what's up?
- Whatever happened

08:21.170 --> 08:22.500
- before I got here, start over.
- You look so cute.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.167
- You look really good.
- Do I?

08:24.170 --> 08:25.666
I'm wearing an old dress and...

08:25.667 --> 08:27.333
- You guys.
- Hi, honey.

08:27.375 --> 08:28.541
- Babe, sit, sit,

08:28.542 --> 08:30.167
we're about to get fitted.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.208
- Okay.
- Oh.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.792
- Oh, this is not...
- This is not...

08:32.833 --> 08:34.042
- You want a bigger pour?
- I... of course.

08:34.045 --> 08:35.333
- Alright. Asa?
- Thank you.

08:35.375 --> 08:36.875
- Beautiful piece, by the way.
- Thank you.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.375
- What color
- is the suit gonna be,

08:38.378 --> 08:39.708
- do we even...?
- He already knows

08:39.711 --> 08:41.042
- what he wants,
- he was like, gray,

08:41.045 --> 08:42.500
pink on that, da da da da.

08:42.542 --> 08:43.958
- Gray and pink?
- Yeah.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.792
- What about Adam,
- is he gonna... he doesn't...

08:45.833 --> 08:46.874
Is he wearing pink and gray?

08:46.875 --> 08:48.375
- Babe, it's a secret wedding.

08:48.417 --> 08:49.688
Adam's not gonna be wearing

08:49.689 --> 08:50.958
pink and gray, no.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.667
- You're gonna not tell him
- what he's wearing?

08:52.708 --> 08:53.958
- No.
- How are we gonna tell him

08:54.000 --> 08:55.625
- it's...
- Babe, Adam thinks

08:55.667 --> 08:56.750
you guys are all coming

08:56.751 --> 08:57.833
to our house

08:57.875 --> 08:59.541
for a housewarming party

08:59.542 --> 09:01.374
and that we, Adam and I,

09:01.375 --> 09:03.041
have planned a lovely dinner...

09:03.042 --> 09:05.333
- Like a really fancy dinner.
- To take our guests out

09:05.375 --> 09:06.833
while they're in town

09:06.875 --> 09:08.458
for our housewarming.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.667
You're making faces.

09:11.708 --> 09:13.583
- I'm trying to hold back
- the tears.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.833
- You...
- This is gonna be your wedding.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.375
- Yeah.

09:16.417 --> 09:17.417
- The surprise wedding

09:17.458 --> 09:19.083
is not a great idea,

09:19.125 --> 09:20.333
in my opinion.

09:20.375 --> 09:21.438
The history of Reza

09:21.439 --> 09:22.500
and Adam's problems

09:22.542 --> 09:24.667
are that Reza makes decisions

09:24.708 --> 09:26.083
without Adam

09:26.125 --> 09:28.542
and Adam might not say yes.

09:28.583 --> 09:29.875
Just remember, you guys,

09:29.917 --> 09:31.416
I just want

09:31.417 --> 09:33.750
to be included.

09:33.792 --> 09:34.875
- Yeah.

09:34.917 --> 09:36.417
- But it won't be the first

09:36.458 --> 09:38.916
or last bad idea Reza's ever had

09:38.917 --> 09:40.833
and I'm along for the ride.

09:40.875 --> 09:41.875
I don't know anything.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.042
- You don't need
- to know anything.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.708
Show up for a dinner,

09:44.750 --> 09:46.250
- that's what
- you're showing up for.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.833
- Reza, no matter what,

09:47.875 --> 09:49.249
I'm gonna be there for you.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.917
- I'll give you a syllabus.
- Is Adam gonna wear...

09:50.958 --> 09:52.917
- An outline.
- I do want a syllabus.

09:52.958 --> 09:55.417
- You'll get a syllabus.
- That would be kind of amazing.

09:55.458 --> 09:56.958
- Coming up...
- You have to understand,

09:56.961 --> 09:58.458
when you met me, I had nothing.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.083
- And who the f... was there
- this whole time?

10:00.125 --> 10:01.125
- You were, you were.

10:01.126 --> 10:02.271
- And you don't treat me

10:02.272 --> 10:03.417
like I was.

10:12.417 --> 10:13.957
- Tini, you wanna get in?

10:13.958 --> 10:15.957
Hop in, come on.

10:15.958 --> 10:17.083
Good boy.

10:20.792 --> 10:22.208
Oh my god, I didn't even know

10:22.250 --> 10:23.875
I had this many Louis.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.417
- What are you bringing, rez?
- I brought like,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.250
shoe options and stuff.

10:27.292 --> 10:28.292
Put one on top

10:28.293 --> 10:29.625
and one on bottom.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.125
- The countdown
- for the surprise wedding

10:31.128 --> 10:32.832
in palm Springs is on.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.332
- Do we even have room?

10:34.333 --> 10:35.625
- First thing we need to do

10:35.667 --> 10:37.625
- is get Adam to come
- to palm Springs

10:37.667 --> 10:39.500
for this "housewarming party"

10:39.542 --> 10:40.958
and we managed that one.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.500
- And now we're just running
- on persian time,

10:42.503 --> 10:43.667
we're super late,

10:43.668 --> 10:44.832
we gotta roll out.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.000
- Ah!

10:46.001 --> 10:47.166
- Ha ha!

10:47.167 --> 10:48.999
I can't wait to see his face.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.334
- Me, too. He has no idea.

10:50.335 --> 10:51.667
- I can't.

10:51.708 --> 10:52.750
- We're gonna get

10:52.751 --> 10:53.792
to palm Springs,

10:53.833 --> 10:54.875
we're gonna have

10:54.876 --> 10:55.917
a beautiful housewarming.

10:55.958 --> 10:58.083
- The next night,
- we're gonna take our friends out

10:58.125 --> 10:59.792
to a lovely dinner

10:59.833 --> 11:01.832
but it's actually not dinner,

11:01.833 --> 11:03.125
it's a surprise wedding.

11:03.167 --> 11:04.500
- Rez, we're driving
- to your wedding.

11:04.503 --> 11:05.666
- I know.

11:05.667 --> 11:06.958
- I mean...
- But babe, we need to get

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
over the hurdle

11:08.042 --> 11:09.458
of the housewarming.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.333
- Oh, you're right,
- we have a few hurdles.

11:11.336 --> 11:12.832
- Wedding venue, check.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.167
Flowers, check.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.208
Guest list, check.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.541
The food has been picked

11:16.542 --> 11:17.792
and now...

11:17.833 --> 11:19.354
I'm gonna have

11:19.355 --> 11:20.874
a double-double protein-style.

11:20.875 --> 11:22.207
- I'll do a number two

11:22.208 --> 11:23.374
with fresh onions

11:23.375 --> 11:24.958
and extra chilis

11:25.000 --> 11:26.541
and also a large drink.

11:26.542 --> 11:27.750
Also, like, an extra

11:27.751 --> 11:28.958
protein-style cheeseburger.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.438
- Woohoo.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.874
- Ha ha.

11:31.875 --> 11:34.125
- Yup, I can't believe it.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.333
- It's hitting me, rez.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.500
It's hitting me.

11:36.542 --> 11:38.333
- Remember how anxious
- you were last year?

11:38.375 --> 11:39.542
- That's not the right feeling...
- Babe, I wasn't...

11:39.543 --> 11:40.542
No.

11:40.543 --> 11:41.708
- Yeah.
- I'm telling you,

11:41.711 --> 11:43.833
that's why I'm shocked Mike

11:43.875 --> 11:45.207
went down that road

11:45.208 --> 11:46.542
with all that sh...

11:46.583 --> 11:48.000
Looming over them.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.125
And I think that there are

11:49.126 --> 11:50.208
actually a lot more things

11:50.250 --> 11:51.707
that we don't know about.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.333
- Which is fine,
- it's not our relationship.

11:53.375 --> 11:54.833
- No, you know...
- I'm eating your fries,

11:54.875 --> 11:56.250
- by the way.
- Please do.

11:56.292 --> 11:57.833
- And I said to him, I know,
- "you know, it sucks,

11:57.875 --> 11:59.583
I'm so happy right now."

11:59.625 --> 12:00.916
I was like, babe,

12:00.917 --> 12:02.749
I was writing my vows

12:02.750 --> 12:04.750
and I was thinking about them

12:04.792 --> 12:06.582
and I was like, "thank god

12:06.583 --> 12:07.916
it's them and not me,"

12:07.917 --> 12:10.083
and then I felt such guilt,

12:10.125 --> 12:11.271
I felt like such

12:11.272 --> 12:12.416
a horrible person

12:12.417 --> 12:13.833
because I knew

12:13.875 --> 12:15.188
that I could have

12:15.189 --> 12:16.500
and would have been

12:16.542 --> 12:19.000
- in that exact same predicament.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- Yo.

- You can have either one.

- Aww, baby.

Oh.

14:48.417 --> 14:49.875
- And now all you care about
- is money,

14:49.917 --> 14:51.000
- so what's better?
- No,

14:51.042 --> 14:52.125
it's not all I care about.

14:52.126 --> 14:53.208
- Yeah, it is.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.582
- Espresso Martini.

14:54.583 --> 14:55.667
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.417
- Any questions
- on the menu, at all?

14:57.420 --> 14:58.542
- Not right now.
- Cool.

14:58.583 --> 14:59.958
- I don't think we're eating.

15:08.958 --> 15:10.758
- I don't even know
- what to cheers to but...

15:25.958 --> 15:27.875
- This is what
- our biggest disconnect is.

15:27.917 --> 15:29.375
- Mm-hmm.
- You think

15:29.417 --> 15:31.083
that being a good husband means

15:31.125 --> 15:33.083
- you pay the bills,
- you provide for me,

15:33.125 --> 15:34.958
- you take me on vacation
- and you buy me things.

15:34.961 --> 15:36.292
- No, you think that's what...

15:36.333 --> 15:37.792
- That's what you think.
- No, no, no, no.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.042
- That's what you always say,
- "I'm providing for you.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.708
- I'm giving you this,
- I'm giving you that."

15:41.750 --> 15:42.979
- Because I want...

15:42.980 --> 15:44.208
- I don't want these things.

15:45.417 --> 15:46.542
When I met you,

15:46.583 --> 15:48.791
I was so in love with you

15:48.792 --> 15:50.458
because you were so...

15:50.500 --> 15:51.625
- Ambitious.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.792
- You didn't care
- about this f... ing bullsh...

15:54.795 --> 15:56.792
- That you care about now.
- I've always cared about it.

15:56.795 --> 15:58.125
- You have to understand,
- when you met me,

15:58.167 --> 15:59.624
I had nothing.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.291
Lost, confused, broken.

16:02.292 --> 16:03.875
- And who the f... was there
- this whole time?

16:03.917 --> 16:04.958
- You were,

16:05.000 --> 16:06.250
you were,

16:06.292 --> 16:07.458
- you were.
- And you don't treat me

16:07.500 --> 16:09.417
like I was.

16:09.458 --> 16:10.792
- And I'm sorry.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.000
- I didn't wanna talk
- about what's going on

16:14.042 --> 16:15.792
for the longest time,

16:15.833 --> 16:17.583
but we have underlying issues

16:17.625 --> 16:19.332
that weren't resolved

16:19.333 --> 16:20.999
before we got married.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.166
Like, trust issues.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.625
So I can't just pretend

16:24.667 --> 16:27.458
that he's this perfect guy

16:27.500 --> 16:30.000
and not doing anything wrong.

16:30.042 --> 16:31.750
- I had some time to reflect

16:31.792 --> 16:34.000
- and what I'm telling you is,
- I've screwed up.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.583
- I've realized
- that just being a provider

16:35.625 --> 16:36.999
is not enough,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.083
you still feel alone,

16:39.125 --> 16:40.885
- or else you wouldn't be
- this way with me.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.666
I've neglected you,

16:43.667 --> 16:45.250
I've been disrespectful to you,

16:45.292 --> 16:46.332
I've talked to you

16:46.333 --> 16:47.542
in a very rude manner.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.333
- Are these the only things
- you've done?

16:52.875 --> 16:54.042
- I'm very sorry

16:54.043 --> 16:55.208
for those things

16:55.250 --> 16:56.833
and I want you back.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.750
- F... my life.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.707
- Jessica's never really seen me

17:05.708 --> 17:06.958
be vulnerable

17:07.000 --> 17:08.208
- because I've always tried
- to keep

17:08.211 --> 17:09.541
that tough exterior,

17:09.542 --> 17:11.500
- like, "hey, I'm the man
- of the house.

17:11.542 --> 17:13.333
I got this, babe, don't worry."

17:13.375 --> 17:15.707
And in this situation with her,

17:15.708 --> 17:17.041
I've lost that.

17:17.042 --> 17:18.542
- When there's water dripping
- like this...

17:18.583 --> 17:20.792
- Listen. Jessica, listen to me.
- It doesn't hurt.

17:20.833 --> 17:21.917
After awhile, it starts

17:21.918 --> 17:23.000
to come annoying as f...

17:23.042 --> 17:24.208
- And then it starts
- to really hurt.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.333
- I get it.
- Guess what?

17:25.375 --> 17:26.792
- Slowly you've been
- dripping on me

17:26.833 --> 17:29.083
- and I stood there
- and I acted like a f... ing idiot

17:29.086 --> 17:30.416
and I didn't care.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.582
Drip, drip, drip, drip...

17:31.583 --> 17:32.916
Now it's hurting

17:32.917 --> 17:34.750
and now I'm f... ing over it.

17:38.542 --> 17:39.688
- Coming up...

17:39.689 --> 17:40.833
- It's my big day.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.833
I think he's gonna say yes,

17:42.875 --> 17:44.542
I hope he's gonna say yes

17:44.583 --> 17:46.249
but I actually don't really know

17:46.250 --> 17:47.396
whether he's gonna say

17:47.397 --> 17:48.542
yes or not.

18:01.708 --> 18:02.750
- I'm kind of like,
- in this coma.

18:02.792 --> 18:05.000
Like, I'm in a nightmare

18:05.042 --> 18:06.292
and I can't get out of it.

18:12.583 --> 18:13.750
- Can we get the bill?

18:14.958 --> 18:16.458
- Sir, can I get
- the bill, please?

18:16.500 --> 18:17.708
- Sure, you got it.

18:26.417 --> 18:28.375
- It's crazy that pain
- will make you realize

18:28.417 --> 18:30.375
how much you're in love

18:30.417 --> 18:33.124
and until you feel this pain,

18:33.125 --> 18:34.458
you can't Gauge

18:34.500 --> 18:35.917
how much you care

18:35.918 --> 18:37.333
about somebody.

18:38.958 --> 18:40.957
And I would always hear,

18:40.958 --> 18:42.438
"you don't know what you have

18:42.439 --> 18:43.917
until it's gone,"

18:43.958 --> 18:45.542
but I never understood that.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.375
- Hello.

18:50.417 --> 18:51.542
- Hi.

18:51.583 --> 18:52.604
- Two or one?

18:52.605 --> 18:53.625
- One.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.958
[Music playing]

19:21.167 --> 19:22.459
- Bam. It's my cousin.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.750
- It's Ali.

19:23.792 --> 19:24.833
- I can hear you guys out there.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.000
- Hey, Ali.

19:26.042 --> 19:27.292
- Adam thinks all our friends

19:27.333 --> 19:28.500
are coming down to palm Springs

19:28.542 --> 19:30.000
for a housewarming party.

19:30.042 --> 19:31.833
- Hey, girl.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.354
- Which is great,

19:33.355 --> 19:34.833
because I've got him fooled,

19:34.875 --> 19:36.792
I just need to keep it that way.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.542
- You look like you're trying
- to get some.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.667
- I am.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.625
- Hey, it's mj.

19:47.876 --> 19:48.876
- Thank you. Oh, hi.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.063
- Is this little toya?

19:50.064 --> 19:51.207
Hey, little toy.

19:51.208 --> 19:52.500
- She like that with everybody.

19:52.542 --> 19:53.709
- Oh my god, honey.

19:53.710 --> 19:54.874
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.208
- Oh no.
- Oh.

19:56.211 --> 19:57.333
- You said dark people

19:57.334 --> 19:58.458
need dark drinks on them

19:58.500 --> 20:00.167
to make them look better.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.875
- Really?

20:01.878 --> 20:03.207
- He just said that to you?

20:03.208 --> 20:04.271
- Yeah.

20:04.272 --> 20:05.333
- Please thank my man

20:05.375 --> 20:06.707
for the outfit change.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.041
- You still look great.

20:08.042 --> 20:10.625
You still look really good.

20:10.667 --> 20:11.874
- Where's Tommy?

20:11.875 --> 20:13.458
- Well, he was working today.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.500
- But is he gonna come

20:14.501 --> 20:15.501
or you don't know yet?

20:15.542 --> 20:17.250
- I think he's planning to.
- I mean,

20:17.253 --> 20:18.582
[speaking farsi]

20:18.583 --> 20:19.916
Everything will be okay.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.396
- You guys, can we please

20:21.397 --> 20:22.875
find out about Mike?

20:22.917 --> 20:24.125
- I can't even imagine

20:24.126 --> 20:25.333
what Mike is going through.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.749
It's a difficult thing

20:26.750 --> 20:28.583
- to come to a place
- where there's couples

20:28.586 --> 20:30.042
and love and you know.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.542
- Asa, from here on out,

20:31.583 --> 20:33.250
if my friends don't involve me

20:33.292 --> 20:34.582
in something,

20:34.583 --> 20:36.250
I'm not gonna involve myself.

20:36.292 --> 20:37.500
- Well, his wife

20:37.501 --> 20:38.708
temporarily left.

20:38.750 --> 20:39.833
They're working things out.

20:39.875 --> 20:40.916
- It's not my f... ing business.

20:40.917 --> 20:42.250
If Mike reaches out to me,

20:42.292 --> 20:44.208
- I would be there for him
- in a heartbeat,

20:44.250 --> 20:46.082
but until that happens,

20:46.083 --> 20:47.542
I can't involve myself.

20:47.583 --> 20:50.249
- I hope that if she bounced,

20:50.250 --> 20:51.916
that it's to teach him a lesson.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.667
- She was the most excited bride

20:53.708 --> 20:54.916
I've ever seen in my life.

20:54.917 --> 20:56.417
- She was too eager.
- She was way too eager.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.292
- I love her to death...
- You guys, some people...

20:58.295 --> 20:59.542
- But she was super eager. - Will only
learn when there's - consequences.

20:59.583 --> 21:00.958
- Why?
- More eager than me.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.291
- The things that are coming out

21:02.292 --> 21:03.624
of Adam's mouth tonight,

21:03.625 --> 21:04.625
like, he's talking

21:04.626 --> 21:05.625
about the eager beaver

21:05.626 --> 21:07.292
- that Jessica was
- to get married,

21:07.295 --> 21:08.375
and what a contrast

21:08.376 --> 21:09.458
his feeling is.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.750
- Wow, I hope it's not too much
- of a contrast

21:11.792 --> 21:12.917
because tomorrow, honey,

21:12.958 --> 21:14.291
you're walking down that aisle,

21:14.292 --> 21:15.292
taking those vows

21:15.333 --> 21:16.917
and locking it down.

21:16.958 --> 21:19.124
- You guys, where's Mike?

21:19.125 --> 21:21.042
- I thought this was supposed
- to be a housewarming party

21:21.083 --> 21:22.875
- and we're just sitting around,
- talking about Mike.

21:22.917 --> 21:25.124
- Oh god, or not.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.417
Ooh,

21:26.458 --> 21:28.208
I need some lemonade.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.875
- What's this?
- Is this eggplant?

21:29.917 --> 21:31.292
- Flank steak.
- Oh.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.542
- Oh, is that Mike?
- Smells like nectarine.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.417
- Oh my god, it's Mike.

21:34.458 --> 21:35.792
- What?

21:35.793 --> 21:37.124
Shut the f... up.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.917

21:42.500 --> 21:44.125
- Glad you made it.
- Yeah.

21:44.167 --> 21:46.332
- I want a certain flow

21:46.333 --> 21:47.917
for our housewarming.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.667
- If you're done
- with dinner, come sit.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.125
- I'm finished.

21:51.167 --> 21:52.500
- Chicken piccata.
- You know what's good?

21:52.503 --> 21:54.333
- Put the pilaf
- and put this sauce on it.

21:54.375 --> 21:55.458
- Alright.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.958
I wanna focus on Adam and Reza.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
- I wanna focus
- on their wedding,

21:58.003 --> 21:59.417
their happiness.

21:59.458 --> 22:00.750
And just decompress

22:00.792 --> 22:02.583
- and stop f... ing
- being in my own head

22:02.625 --> 22:04.125
about what's going on at home.

22:04.167 --> 22:05.167
- Mike.

22:05.168 --> 22:06.750
- Right next to...
- Mike,

- gonna f... ing keep

22:18.208 --> 22:19.332
picking on me.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.417
- Alright, alright.
- His wife left him.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.375
- What the f...
- Are you talking about?

22:22.417 --> 22:23.833
It's not even true.

22:23.875 --> 22:24.875
- I'm tired of it,
- I just don't wanna deal

22:24.878 --> 22:26.207
with it this weekend.

- of this bitch.

I rented a party house for us

22:37.208 --> 22:39.167
- in the neighborhood
- next door to mine.

22:39.208 --> 22:40.458
