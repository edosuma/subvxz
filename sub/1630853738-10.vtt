[gunfire]DANNY:
My name is Danny McNamara.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.052
I used to work for the FBI.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.880
LEXI:
And I'm Lexi Vaziri.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.447
I used to be a thief.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.536
DANNY:
Excuse me, a master thief.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.886
We're back on the hunt
after the Vatican

00:16.929 --> 00:18.757
was attacked
by a mysterious group

00:18.801 --> 00:21.760
led by someone who calls himself
the Great Khan.

00:21.804 --> 00:24.154
LEXI:
He's looking for
an ancient Mongolian artifact

00:24.198 --> 00:28.071
called the Spirit Banner.DANNY: Also known
as the Soul of Genghis Khan.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.204
And they're leaving
a path of destruction

00:33.642 --> 00:35.600
LEXI:
So, it looks like it's up to us
to stop them

00:35.644 --> 00:37.080
by finding the Banner.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.603
DANNY:
Before they do.

00:41.911 --> 00:44.261
Previously on
Blood & Treasure...

00:44.305 --> 00:45.654
The Banner has Khan's DNA on it.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.438
LEXI:
Maybe the Great Khan wants it

00:47.482 --> 00:49.223
to weaponize Genghis' DNA.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.354
[shouting]

00:50.398 --> 00:53.531
After the battle, we found this.

00:53.575 --> 00:56.056
Are you familiar with the
secret history of the Mongols?

00:56.099 --> 00:58.058
The earliest history
of Genghis' life.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.277
This scroll is
believed to contain

01:00.321 --> 01:01.757
directions to the tomb
of Genghis Khan.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.367
KATE:
You think

01:03.411 --> 01:05.065
the Mongolians brought
the Banner back to Genghis

01:05.108 --> 01:07.589
and buried it with him?Yes.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.547
[groans, flames roaring]

01:12.246 --> 01:14.596
No, I can't leave her!You go in there, you die.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.120
VIOLET:
The Khan is still alive,

01:17.164 --> 01:20.297
and shedoes not like
to be challenged.

01:20.341 --> 01:23.692
Give me your loyalty,
and the world will be ours.

[Kate laughs]LEXI:
He never saw it coming.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.971

01:42.014 --> 01:44.626
Here, I'll get
the drinks.Oh, yeah.

01:44.669 --> 01:45.931
What? What's so funny?

01:45.975 --> 01:48.064
Nothing.Nothing.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.067
It's... great

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
seeing you two
getting along so well.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.854
Just sharing stories,
you know.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.508
Nothing to be paranoid about.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.162
Mm.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.471
To finding the scroll.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.907
And next,

02:04.950 --> 02:06.517
the Banner.I'll drink to that.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.042
VIOLET:
Can I get one of those?

Violet?

02:17.006 --> 02:20.705
The explosion
in... Kazakhstan.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.925
I saw you die.Really?

02:22.968 --> 02:25.145
After you left
me behind.

02:25.188 --> 02:28.235
Again?
I'd still be there

02:28.278 --> 02:30.846
if it weren't for
the town scavengers.I'm sorry.

02:30.889 --> 02:31.934
Blame me.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.286
She didn't want to leave you.
I forced her to go.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.333
I'm sure she fought very hard.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.639
Vi, please.Anyways,

02:41.683 --> 02:43.641
I still expect that
you'll clear my record

02:43.685 --> 02:45.295
after all this?Of course,

02:45.339 --> 02:47.384
anything you want.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.475
Forgive me.

02:52.476 --> 02:55.827
[short chuckle]
Less talk, more booze.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.916
Right.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.181
How did you find us?

03:01.224 --> 03:03.183
Shaw told me that you guys were
crashing at his place.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.533
where is he, anyways?Hospital.

03:05.576 --> 03:06.751
It's nothing serious.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.231
Just got banged
up a little bit.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.364
Who's the badge?

03:10.407 --> 03:11.800
Excuse me?

03:11.843 --> 03:13.715
Oh, your shoes
are way too sensible.

03:13.758 --> 03:16.196
They might as well have sirens
and flashing lights on them.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.459
And your watch
and your posture.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.461
You just smell of cop.DANNY: Violet,

03:20.504 --> 03:21.940
this is Kate.

03:21.984 --> 03:24.639
She's a friend
helping us find the Banner.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.075
Nice to meet you, Violet.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.601
Any word on
the Banner?

03:30.645 --> 03:32.212
Oh, yes.Yeah.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.779
We, uh, found a Scroll
that's supposedly a lost chapter

03:34.823 --> 03:37.434
from The Secret History
of the Mongols.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.654
Should lead us
to Genghis' Tomb.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.133
We think
the Banner is in the tomb.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.613
[phone vibrates]So, what are
you waiting for?

03:42.657 --> 03:44.833
We need to translate
the scroll first.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.922
I just heard back
from Helena.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.706
She's a linguistics professor

03:48.750 --> 03:50.142
that I consulted with
back that the Bureau.

03:50.186 --> 03:51.709
Okay, good.
She's excited to take a look

03:51.753 --> 03:53.015
at the scroll.Great.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.409
Well, now that
I've come this far

03:55.452 --> 03:57.367
and I almost got blown up
trying to find the thing,

03:57.411 --> 03:58.803
I'm gonna see
it through.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.414
I don't think we'll
need any extra help.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.154
Will we, Danny?

04:02.198 --> 04:04.331
Um, actually, I'm
part of the original

04:04.374 --> 04:06.071
squad, Kate.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.769
Lexi and I go way back,

04:07.812 --> 04:10.598
even before human
Wikipedia over here.Yup.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.209
She's right. Vi here--

04:13.253 --> 04:14.906
she's a Jill-of-all-trades.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.386
Got us out
of more tough situations

04:16.430 --> 04:17.953
than I can count, so,

04:17.996 --> 04:20.042
we could use her help
anywhere we're gonna go.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.696
Hmm.DANNY: Okay, then.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.046
Next stop: Prague.

04:24.089 --> 04:27.005
Think we can borrow
your jet again?

04:27.049 --> 04:29.617
I'll make a call.DANNY: I'll let Helena know

04:29.660 --> 04:31.140
we're on our way.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.752
She's got a jet?

04:34.796 --> 04:36.841
Oh, her family does. Long story.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.234
Huh.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.628
I'm gonna go pack.

04:40.671 --> 04:42.238
I'll meet you at the bar.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.066
Tell Hahn you're with us.

04:44.109 --> 04:46.460
Hahn is that ten-year-old
bartender?Hey,

04:46.503 --> 04:48.200
the kid makes a mean
lychee martini.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.377
[short chuckle]

04:50.420 --> 04:52.161
Oh, God.Yeah.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.597
Um, I'm gonna go pack.All right, go.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.686
Go, go.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.042
Jet will be ready
in an hour.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.393
What do you know about Violet?

05:06.436 --> 05:08.656
She and Lexi
used to work together.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.354
Oh, so... she's a thief, too.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.008
She was going
after a bounty

05:13.051 --> 05:15.358
the Khan put out
on the Banner, but

05:15.402 --> 05:17.099
I promised
to help clear her record

05:17.142 --> 05:18.753
if she helped us
find it instead.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.364
And you trust her to give up
money for going straight?

05:21.408 --> 05:23.061
Trust...

05:23.105 --> 05:24.149
is a strong word.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.499
But I do believe
she would

05:25.542 --> 05:26.500
do anything for Lexi.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.849
Don't be so quick

05:27.892 --> 05:30.417
to ignore your instincts.
The Khan's horde

05:30.460 --> 05:32.506
has been with you
every step of the way.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.898
Okay.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.378
I can try to find
a way to lose her.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.425
Actually, let her come along.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.122
If my hunch is right,
she might be

05:40.165 --> 05:41.602
the best link to the Khan
that we've had yet.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.431
And I want
to keep an eye on her.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.825
There's a quick way to find out
just who she really is.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.933
The CIA has an app?

06:08.977 --> 06:10.587
It's no Candy Crush, but

06:10.631 --> 06:12.415
it gets the job done.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.634
Huh.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.245
Let's keep this between us.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.507
You tell Lexi,

06:17.551 --> 06:18.856
she might tip our hand.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.424
Yeah, Lexi would kill for her.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.426
We're gonna need
rock-solid proof

06:23.470 --> 06:24.949
if we're gonna change that.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.953
And just to be safe,

06:28.997 --> 06:31.173
keep my Agency background
to yourself, too.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.882
♪

07:14.956 --> 07:16.958
Mmm. Yummy.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.395
Is it bluefin?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.005
You don't mind if
I have some, do you?

07:23.268 --> 07:25.270
All gone.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.708
It's like being in prep
school with the yakuza.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.066
I take it
you found Danny and Lexi?

07:38.109 --> 07:39.807
I'm following them to Prague

07:39.850 --> 07:41.896
where an expert
will translate the scroll

07:41.939 --> 07:43.898
that'll lead us to the Banner.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.552
Pack up.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.554
Yes, my Khan.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.207
Listen, Violet,

07:49.251 --> 07:51.645
I had absolutely no inkling
you were the Great Khan.

07:51.688 --> 07:55.170
And I have to say, you've
played everyone brilliantly,

07:55.213 --> 07:57.215
including me.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.479
Maybe you stole a little
from my playbook,

07:59.522 --> 08:01.611
but you improved upon it.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.526
I thought I was a maniac.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.615
Isn't that what you said
about the Great Khan?

08:05.659 --> 08:08.400
Well, let's face it, Violet.
You are a bit of a maniac.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.533
But so am I.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.013
You'll recall I only said that

08:12.056 --> 08:13.493
when I was trying
to save your life.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.973
That should count
for something.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.541
Actually, it does.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.065
You were disloyal
to the Great Khan,

08:21.109 --> 08:22.806
but you were loyal to me.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.461
Which is one of the reasons
why I'm not going to kill you.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.120
Well, that's, uh...

08:32.163 --> 08:34.122
heartening.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.776
We work well
together.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.865
We both hate the privileged
and the powerful.

08:37.908 --> 08:41.956
I'll admit, it's rare to find
someone who challenges me.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.697
Which you do on every occasion.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.786
Listen, I hope
I'm not being out of line.

08:45.829 --> 08:48.745
You seem a little more tense now
than you were before.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.705
Kate Reece is coming with us.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.445
She's playing coy
that she's CIA,

08:53.489 --> 08:55.317
but she keeps
asking questions,

08:55.360 --> 08:57.798
and I think she suspects me.Sounds like

08:57.841 --> 09:00.278
the perfect opportunity
to take me to Prague with you.

09:00.322 --> 09:04.021
In fact, I am
the one person in the world

09:04.065 --> 09:05.980
that you can rely on.

09:06.023 --> 09:10.114
Well, I am interested
in learning

09:10.158 --> 09:12.769
about your various...skills.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.338
But if you make me regret it,

09:16.381 --> 09:19.646
I'll put your severed
head on a pike.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.005
So what's this errand
Violet had to run?

09:31.048 --> 09:32.746
Well, she's got
a friend here in Prague.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.922
Figured she wanted
to skip the boring stuff.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.619
Where did Kate disappear to?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.665
Um, work stuff,

09:38.708 --> 09:39.927
I guess.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.668
So, uh, what's it say, Helena?

09:41.711 --> 09:43.931
The scroll's made of vellum.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.759
Calfskin.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.238
Or, in this case,

09:47.282 --> 09:48.457
human.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.938
Human skin? Hmm.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.375
Weren't the other scrolls
made of silk?

09:53.418 --> 09:55.377
The DNA analysis confirms it.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.858
The oils in the skin
make a protective barrier,

09:57.901 --> 09:59.555
so the carbon dating takes

09:59.599 --> 10:01.035
a little longer.Huh.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.472
What is it?Arcanum Gladio

10:03.515 --> 10:05.605
wanted the Banner
during the Cold War

10:05.648 --> 10:08.259
because it had
Genghis' DNA on it.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.913
Right, to create a virus

10:09.957 --> 10:12.568
that targeted Chinese
and Russian Communists.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.049
What if the Khan wants to take
A.G.'s research and flip it?

10:15.092 --> 10:18.095
Use Genghis' DNA to
protect his people

10:18.139 --> 10:21.142
from a virus engineered to kill
everyone else on the planet?

10:21.185 --> 10:22.622
Fits his M.O.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.449
He's only
went after Western targets.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.714
[computer chirps]

10:27.757 --> 10:30.499
It's only
a preliminary scan, but

10:30.542 --> 10:32.414
I'm confident it's authentic.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.895
Likely over 800 years old.

10:34.938 --> 10:35.939
How fast can you translate it?

10:35.983 --> 10:37.245
I used the pictures

10:37.288 --> 10:39.856
you sent me
to get started.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.686
I also pulled
some relevant reference books.
