00:04.482 --> 00:07.572
[gunfire]DANNY:
My name is Danny McNamara.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.052
I used to work for the FBI.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.880
LEXI:
And I'm Lexi Vaziri.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.447
I used to be a thief.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.536
DANNY:
Excuse me, a master thief.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.886
We're back on the hunt
after the Vatican

00:16.929 --> 00:18.757
was attacked
by a mysterious group

00:18.801 --> 00:21.760
led by someone who calls himself
the Great Khan.

00:21.804 --> 00:24.154
LEXI:
He's looking for
an ancient Mongolian artifact

00:24.198 --> 00:28.071
called the Spirit Banner.DANNY: Also known
as the Soul of Genghis Khan.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.204
And they're leaving
a path of destruction

00:33.642 --> 00:35.600
LEXI:
So, it looks like it's up to us
to stop them

00:35.644 --> 00:37.080
by finding the Banner.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.603
DANNY:
Before they do.

00:41.911 --> 00:44.261
Previously on
Blood & Treasure...

00:44.305 --> 00:45.654
The Banner has Khan's DNA on it.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.438
LEXI:
Maybe the Great Khan wants it

00:47.482 --> 00:49.223
to weaponize Genghis' DNA.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.354
[shouting]

00:50.398 --> 00:53.531
After the battle, we found this.

00:53.575 --> 00:56.056
Are you familiar with the
secret history of the Mongols?

00:56.099 --> 00:58.058
The earliest history
of Genghis' life.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.277
This scroll is
believed to contain

01:00.321 --> 01:01.757
directions to the tomb
of Genghis Khan.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.367
KATE:
You think

01:03.411 --> 01:05.065
the Mongolians brought
the Banner back to Genghis

01:05.108 --> 01:07.589
and buried it with him?Yes.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.547
[groans, flames roaring]

01:12.246 --> 01:14.596
No, I can't leave her!You go in there, you die.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.120
VIOLET:
The Khan is still alive,

01:17.164 --> 01:20.297
and shedoes not like
to be challenged.

01:20.341 --> 01:23.692
Give me your loyalty,
and the world will be ours.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.925
[Kate laughs]LEXI:
He never saw it coming.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.971
[laughter]

01:42.014 --> 01:44.626
Here, I'll get
the drinks.Oh, yeah.

01:44.669 --> 01:45.931
What? What's so funny?

01:45.975 --> 01:48.064
Nothing.Nothing.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.067
It's... great

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
seeing you two
getting along so well.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.854
Just sharing stories,
you know.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.508
Nothing to be paranoid about.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.162
Mm.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.471
To finding the scroll.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.907
And next,

02:04.950 --> 02:06.517
the Banner.I'll drink to that.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.042
VIOLET:
Can I get one of those?

02:13.698 --> 02:15.526
[glass breaks]

02:15.570 --> 02:16.962
DANNY:
Violet?

02:17.006 --> 02:20.705
The explosion
in... Kazakhstan.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.925
I saw you die.Really?

02:22.968 --> 02:25.145
After you left
me behind.

02:25.188 --> 02:28.235
Again?
I'd still be there

02:28.278 --> 02:30.846
if it weren't for
the town scavengers.I'm sorry.

02:30.889 --> 02:31.934
Blame me.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.286
She didn't want to leave you.
I forced her to go.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.333
I'm sure she fought very hard.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.639
Vi, please.Anyways,

02:41.683 --> 02:43.641
I still expect that
you'll clear my record

02:43.685 --> 02:45.295
after all this?Of course,

02:45.339 --> 02:47.384
anything you want.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.475
Forgive me.

02:52.476 --> 02:55.827
[short chuckle]
Less talk, more booze.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.916
Right.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.181
How did you find us?

03:01.224 --> 03:03.183
Shaw told me that you guys were
crashing at his place.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.533
where is he, anyways?Hospital.

03:05.576 --> 03:06.751
It's nothing serious.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.231
Just got banged
up a little bit.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.364
Who's the badge?

03:10.407 --> 03:11.800
Excuse me?

03:11.843 --> 03:13.715
Oh, your shoes
are way too sensible.

03:13.758 --> 03:16.196
They might as well have sirens
and flashing lights on them.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.459
And your watch
and your posture.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.461
You just smell of cop.DANNY: Violet,

03:20.504 --> 03:21.940
this is Kate.

03:21.984 --> 03:24.639
She's a friend
helping us find the Banner.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.075
Nice to meet you, Violet.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.601
Any word on
the Banner?

03:30.645 --> 03:32.212
Oh, yes.Yeah.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.779
We, uh, found a Scroll
that's supposedly a lost chapter

03:34.823 --> 03:37.434
from The Secret History
of the Mongols.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.654
Should lead us
to Genghis' Tomb.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.133
We think
the Banner is in the tomb.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.613
[phone vibrates]So, what are
you waiting for?

03:42.657 --> 03:44.833
We need to translate
the scroll first.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.922
I just heard back
from Helena.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.706
She's a linguistics professor

03:48.750 --> 03:50.142
that I consulted with
back that the Bureau.

03:50.186 --> 03:51.709
Okay, good.
She's excited to take a look

03:51.753 --> 03:53.015
at the scroll.Great.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.409
Well, now that
I've come this far

03:55.452 --> 03:57.367
and I almost got blown up
trying to find the thing,

03:57.411 --> 03:58.803
I'm gonna see
it through.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.414
I don't think we'll
need any extra help.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.154
Will we, Danny?

04:02.198 --> 04:04.331
Um, actually, I'm
part of the original

04:04.374 --> 04:06.071
squad, Kate.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.769
Lexi and I go way back,

04:07.812 --> 04:10.598
even before human
Wikipedia over here.Yup.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.209
She's right. Vi here--

04:13.253 --> 04:14.906
she's a Jill-of-all-trades.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.386
Got us out
of more tough situations

04:16.430 --> 04:17.953
than I can count, so,

04:17.996 --> 04:20.042
we could use her help
anywhere we're gonna go.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.696
Hmm.DANNY: Okay, then.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.046
Next stop: Prague.

04:24.089 --> 04:27.005
Think we can borrow
your jet again?

04:27.049 --> 04:29.617
I'll make a call.DANNY: I'll let Helena know

04:29.660 --> 04:31.140
we're on our way.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.752
She's got a jet?

04:34.796 --> 04:36.841
Oh, her family does. Long story.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.234
Huh.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.628
I'm gonna go pack.

04:40.671 --> 04:42.238
I'll meet you at the bar.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.066
Tell Hahn you're with us.

04:44.109 --> 04:46.460
Hahn is that ten-year-old
bartender?Hey,

04:46.503 --> 04:48.200
the kid makes a mean
lychee martini.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.377
[short chuckle]

04:50.420 --> 04:52.161
Oh, God.Yeah.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.597
Um, I'm gonna go pack.All right, go.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.686
Go, go.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.042
Jet will be ready
in an hour.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.393
What do you know about Violet?

05:06.436 --> 05:08.656
She and Lexi
used to work together.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.354
Oh, so... she's a thief, too.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.008
She was going
after a bounty

05:13.051 --> 05:15.358
the Khan put out
on the Banner, but

05:15.402 --> 05:17.099
I promised
to help clear her record

05:17.142 --> 05:18.753
if she helped us
find it instead.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.364
And you trust her to give up
money for going straight?

05:21.408 --> 05:23.061
Trust...

05:23.105 --> 05:24.149
is a strong word.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.499
But I do believe
she would

05:25.542 --> 05:26.500
do anything for Lexi.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.849
Don't be so quick

05:27.892 --> 05:30.417
to ignore your instincts.
The Khan's horde

05:30.460 --> 05:32.506
has been with you
every step of the way.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.898
Okay.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.378
I can try to find
a way to lose her.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.425
Actually, let her come along.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.122
If my hunch is right,
she might be

05:40.165 --> 05:41.602
the best link to the Khan
that we've had yet.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.431
And I want
to keep an eye on her.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.825
There's a quick way to find out
just who she really is.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.933
The CIA has an app?

06:08.977 --> 06:10.587
It's no Candy Crush, but

06:10.631 --> 06:12.415
it gets the job done.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.634
Huh.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.245
Let's keep this between us.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.507
You tell Lexi,

06:17.551 --> 06:18.856
she might tip our hand.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.424
Yeah, Lexi would kill for her.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.426
We're gonna need
rock-solid proof

06:23.470 --> 06:24.949
if we're gonna change that.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.953
And just to be safe,

06:28.997 --> 06:31.173
keep my Agency background
to yourself, too.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.882
â™ª

07:14.956 --> 07:16.958
Mmm. Yummy.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.395
Is it bluefin?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.005
You don't mind if
I have some, do you?

07:23.268 --> 07:25.270
All gone.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.708
It's like being in prep
school with the yakuza.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.066
I take it
you found Danny and Lexi?

07:38.109 --> 07:39.807
I'm following them to Prague

07:39.850 --> 07:41.896
where an expert
will translate the scroll

07:41.939 --> 07:43.898
that'll lead us to the Banner.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.552
Pack up.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.554
Yes, my Khan.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.207
Listen, Violet,

07:49.251 --> 07:51.645
I had absolutely no inkling
you were the Great Khan.

07:51.688 --> 07:55.170
And I have to say, you've
played everyone brilliantly,

07:55.213 --> 07:57.215
including me.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.479
Maybe you stole a little
from my playbook,

07:59.522 --> 08:01.611
but you improved upon it.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.526
I thought I was a maniac.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.615
Isn't that what you said
about the Great Khan?

08:05.659 --> 08:08.400
Well, let's face it, Violet.
You are a bit of a maniac.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.533
But so am I.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.013
You'll recall I only said that

08:12.056 --> 08:13.493
when I was trying
to save your life.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.973
That should count
for something.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.541
Actually, it does.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.065
You were disloyal
to the Great Khan,

08:21.109 --> 08:22.806
but you were loyal to me.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.461
Which is one of the reasons
why I'm not going to kill you.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.120
Well, that's, uh...

08:32.163 --> 08:34.122
heartening.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.776
We work well
together.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.865
We both hate the privileged
and the powerful.

08:37.908 --> 08:41.956
I'll admit, it's rare to find
someone who challenges me.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.697
Which you do on every occasion.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.786
Listen, I hope
I'm not being out of line.

08:45.829 --> 08:48.745
You seem a little more tense now
than you were before.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.705
Kate Reece is coming with us.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.445
She's playing coy
that she's CIA,

08:53.489 --> 08:55.317
but she keeps
asking questions,

08:55.360 --> 08:57.798
and I think she suspects me.Sounds like

08:57.841 --> 09:00.278
the perfect opportunity
to take me to Prague with you.

09:00.322 --> 09:04.021
In fact, I am
the one person in the world

09:04.065 --> 09:05.980
that you can rely on.

09:06.023 --> 09:10.114
Well, I am interested
in learning

09:10.158 --> 09:12.769
about your various...skills.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.338
But if you make me regret it,

09:16.381 --> 09:19.646
I'll put your severed
head on a pike.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.005
So what's this errand
Violet had to run?

09:31.048 --> 09:32.746
Well, she's got
a friend here in Prague.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.922
Figured she wanted
to skip the boring stuff.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.619
Where did Kate disappear to?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.665
Um, work stuff,

09:38.708 --> 09:39.927
I guess.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.668
So, uh, what's it say, Helena?

09:41.711 --> 09:43.931
The scroll's made of vellum.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.759
Calfskin.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.238
Or, in this case,

09:47.282 --> 09:48.457
human.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.938
Human skin? Hmm.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.375
Weren't the other scrolls
made of silk?

09:53.418 --> 09:55.377
The DNA analysis confirms it.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.858
The oils in the skin
make a protective barrier,

09:57.901 --> 09:59.555
so the carbon dating takes

09:59.599 --> 10:01.035
a little longer.Huh.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.472
What is it?Arcanum Gladio

10:03.515 --> 10:05.605
wanted the Banner
during the Cold War

10:05.648 --> 10:08.259
because it had
Genghis' DNA on it.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.913
Right, to create a virus

10:09.957 --> 10:12.568
that targeted Chinese
and Russian Communists.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.049
What if the Khan wants to take
A.G.'s research and flip it?

10:15.092 --> 10:18.095
Use Genghis' DNA to
protect his people

10:18.139 --> 10:21.142
from a virus engineered to kill
everyone else on the planet?

10:21.185 --> 10:22.622
Fits his M.O.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.449
He's only
went after Western targets.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.714
[computer chirps]

10:27.757 --> 10:30.499
It's only
a preliminary scan, but

10:30.542 --> 10:32.414
I'm confident it's authentic.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.895
Likely over 800 years old.

10:34.938 --> 10:35.939
How fast can you translate it?

10:35.983 --> 10:37.245
I used the pictures

10:37.288 --> 10:39.856
you sent me
to get started.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.686
I also pulled
some relevant reference books.

10:47.603 --> 10:53.043
"To find Genghis Khan
who sleeps under eternal sky,

10:53.087 --> 10:56.525
start at the roots
of his empire's Silver Tree."

10:56.568 --> 10:58.919
The Silver Tree
was a fountain

10:58.962 --> 11:00.442
symbolizing the center

11:00.485 --> 11:02.183
of the four quadrants
of Genghis' empire.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.620
But it moved around, so,

11:04.664 --> 11:07.014
"Silver Tree" must be a metaphor
for the literal center point

11:07.057 --> 11:08.406
of Genghis' empire.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.718
Yeah. There.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.329
I think that's the starting
point the scroll refers to.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.334
"The death of
Genghis Khan rang out

11:23.378 --> 11:25.597
"across the bridge of the river

11:25.641 --> 11:29.732
where Genghis met
his blood brother Jamukha."

11:29.776 --> 11:31.865
Jamukha helped him
conquer his whole empire,

11:31.908 --> 11:34.215
and then became
his mortal enemy.

11:34.258 --> 11:37.218
That's strange the scroll
would be invoking him.

11:38.393 --> 11:41.439
Okay, do we know where they met?
We can start there.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.441
Earlier scrolls
suggest the...

11:43.485 --> 11:44.834
Followed her to her meetup.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.444
She lost me
for a few minutes.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.490
When I picked her back up,
she was alone again.

11:49.447 --> 11:53.756
I'd say she's definitely
up to something.Okay. [clears throat]

11:53.800 --> 11:55.715
My friend flaked.Well, perfect timing.

11:57.281 --> 12:00.415
Danny, the scroll ends
with the words

12:00.458 --> 12:03.113
"Genghis Khan
was buried in secret,

12:03.157 --> 12:05.115
"so not even his most
reverent followers

12:05.159 --> 12:06.769
would seek his tomb."

12:06.813 --> 12:08.423
The Mongols

12:08.466 --> 12:10.294
don't want the tomb found.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.122
We need to stay a step ahead
of the Khan.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.298
And if our theory
on the DNA virus is right,

12:14.342 --> 12:16.126
we need to find the
Banner before he does,

12:16.170 --> 12:17.780
no matter what
the scroll says,

12:17.824 --> 12:19.782
or he's gonna kill
billions of people.

12:34.101 --> 12:37.191
â™ª

12:53.860 --> 12:56.993
DANNY:
The scroll said
Genghis Khan's death

12:57.037 --> 13:00.301
rang across the bridge
of the river.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.347
Bridge? What bridge?

13:03.391 --> 13:06.350
Well, back then, armies
didn't fight in the winter.

13:06.394 --> 13:07.612
The Mongols used

13:07.656 --> 13:09.397
frozen rivers
like highways--

13:09.440 --> 13:11.660
giving them the element
of surprise.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.793
So the frozen river
isthe bridge.

13:13.836 --> 13:14.968
KATE:Smart.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.534
So where do we cross?

13:16.578 --> 13:19.189
The Mongol army
moved on horseback.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.626
We need to find a spot
shallow enough for the river

13:21.670 --> 13:22.889
to freeze over completely.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.542
Come on.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.819
What's her story?

13:41.298 --> 13:43.561
She's Jay Reece's
daughter.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.521
The billionaire?

13:46.564 --> 13:48.828
Oh, my God.I know.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.699
You know, ten years ago,
the only way

13:50.742 --> 13:52.788
you'd be hanging out
with a billionaire's daughter

13:52.832 --> 13:54.572
is if you were casing her.

13:54.616 --> 13:58.533
Ten years ago, I was a very
different person. You know that.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.841
Don't you wish
it was like the old days?

14:01.884 --> 14:05.105
You know, just you and
me against the world?[chuckles]

14:05.148 --> 14:07.237
It's not so bad
having a bigger crew.

14:07.281 --> 14:11.851
Well, when it's a rich girl
trying to steal your man it is.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.896
I don't have
to trust her.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.159
I trust him.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.512
All right. I'm just
looking out for my girl.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.082
What is
that thing?

14:26.126 --> 14:28.084
DANNY:
It's an Ovoo.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.782
It's an ancient shrine.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.133
LEXI:
Could be the marker

14:33.176 --> 14:35.178
for Genghis Khan's burial site.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.789
Why is no one guarding it?

14:37.833 --> 14:41.184
KATE:
I don't know, but
the scroll led us here, right?

14:41.228 --> 14:43.230
Something's wrong.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.928
The scroll used Jamukha
as a signpost

14:45.972 --> 14:48.757
even though
he betrayed Genghis Khan.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.933
Then warned us not
to seek the tomb.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.935
The Mongols went

14:52.979 --> 14:54.850
to a lot of effort to bury
Genghis Khan in secret.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.505
Why would they build a
shrine to mark his grave?

14:57.548 --> 15:00.812
DANNY:
Unless it's not a grave marker.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.249
Violet.

15:02.292 --> 15:03.772
DANNY:
It's a trap!

15:03.815 --> 15:05.252
Violet, stop!

15:05.295 --> 15:08.037
Violet!

15:08.081 --> 15:10.344
Violet, stop!

15:12.128 --> 15:13.521
LEXI: You okay?[Violet groans]

15:16.350 --> 15:17.742
That was a close call.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.397
Thanks, Lulu.Yeah, don't mention it.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.877
You okay?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
Yeah.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.968
I'm better than that guy.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.796
KATE:
Good news is

15:27.839 --> 15:30.190
if we can't find the tomb,
the Great Khan can't, either.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.018
Well, word is
the Khan has hundreds

15:32.061 --> 15:33.497
of people looking for it.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.716
It's not gonna
stay hidden forever.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.718
Well, good luck to him.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.894
Because even the Mongolians
don't know where the tomb is.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.852
The Banner's out there.

15:40.896 --> 15:43.768
Gen said when the Mongolian
tribesmen took the Banner back

15:43.812 --> 15:47.598
they told him "the Soul
shall return to the Soul."

15:47.642 --> 15:49.818
Now, we assumed
that meant Genghis, but...

15:49.861 --> 15:51.559
someone else
had a piece of his soul.

15:51.602 --> 15:54.475
Jamukha.
His blood brother.

15:54.518 --> 15:55.911
DANNY:
To the Mongols,

15:55.955 --> 15:57.304
when they shared their blood,

15:57.347 --> 15:59.349
they exchanged
a part of their souls.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.785
Where is Jamukha buried?

16:00.829 --> 16:02.178
No one knows for sure.

16:02.222 --> 16:05.312
But in the '80s,
a 13th century tomb

16:05.355 --> 16:07.140
was excavated
in Ulaanbaatar.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.403
The remains matched those
thought to be of Jamukha.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.492
Ulaanbaatar's
a seven-hour drive.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.189
Yeah, it's gonna
get dark soon, so,

16:13.233 --> 16:15.322
why don't we set up
camp for the night,

16:15.365 --> 16:18.064
head out first thing
in the morning?

16:24.592 --> 16:27.160
LEXI:
Hey, what are you up to?

16:27.203 --> 16:29.379
Just trying to find
any clues on Jamukha

16:29.423 --> 16:32.817
that will shed light
on where his tomb might be.

16:32.861 --> 16:35.255
Jamukha.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.648
[sighs]

16:37.692 --> 16:39.868
Why do you think
he turned on Genghis?

16:39.911 --> 16:41.348
[sighs]

16:41.391 --> 16:43.611
Jealousy, ambition.

16:45.613 --> 16:49.225
Jamukha ultimately went
to war with him to be Khan.

16:49.269 --> 16:52.750
Hmm. Sounds like he got
what was coming to him.

16:55.797 --> 16:59.061
What? I'm all
about loyalty.

16:59.105 --> 17:03.196
Okay. I'll be sure
to never go to war against you.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.285
[laughs]

17:05.328 --> 17:07.287
You I'm not worried about.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.593
But Kate...

17:09.637 --> 17:12.074
better keep her
hands to herself.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.339
Why would you say that?

17:16.383 --> 17:19.125
Violet thinks Kate's
still in love with you.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.691
[laughs]

17:20.735 --> 17:22.737
Don't give me that
"What? Please." look.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.827
I'm not blind. I see the
way she looks at you.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.003
Violet's been back
in our life one day,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.657
and she's already
stirring the pot.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.311
It's not about her.

17:31.354 --> 17:34.270
I don't know about that.

17:34.314 --> 17:36.098
Meaning?

17:36.142 --> 17:39.623
What if being loyal to Violet
meant being against me?

17:41.016 --> 17:43.192
Or vice versa?

17:43.236 --> 17:44.933
That's nonsense. I...

17:44.976 --> 17:49.155
I can be loyal to both of you.

17:49.198 --> 17:52.114
Any issue one of you has
with the other, we'll just,

17:52.158 --> 17:53.594
you know, figure it out.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.161
It's just about communication.

17:55.204 --> 17:59.469
Which I'm very good at,
if I do say so myself.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.103
[phone chimes]

18:26.366 --> 18:28.411
What's the story?

18:28.455 --> 18:30.500
I've just received a message
from the Khan.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.807
She wants you
to do some research.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.069
What, now?

18:35.244 --> 18:37.028
Let's have a look, then.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.903
Oh.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.123
I'm going to need
to use your computer.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.689
Do you mind?

18:46.821 --> 18:48.257
TAKAGI:
Don't go looking

18:48.301 --> 18:50.129
anywhere you're
not supposed to.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.133
I'll be watching.How comforting.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.700
I don't suppose there's any
more of that coffee, is there?

18:56.744 --> 18:59.790
Her message didn't say
anything about coffee.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.577
Right.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.380
[phone vibrates]

19:36.871 --> 19:38.046
You look like
you just saw a ghost.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.614
No, I'm good.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.311
Bad news?

19:43.312 --> 19:45.662
Good news, actually.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.752
I need to make a call.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.538
[grunting]

20:13.560 --> 20:15.039
â™ª

20:42.893 --> 20:44.895
Give the phone to Simon.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.288
SIMON:
Hello?

20:46.332 --> 20:47.681
We have a problem.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.509
Yeah? What is it?

20:49.552 --> 20:51.424
I just killed Kate.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.296
That escalated quickly.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.559
Danny and Lexi are asleep.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.648
Send in the team.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.564
Kill Danny, but make sure
Lexi's taken alive.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.174
No. No, no.
Wait a minute. Wait.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.046
We still haven't found
Jamukha's tomb.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.091
I'd say they're worth

21:07.135 --> 21:08.832
a lot more alive than dead.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.747
They're gonna wake up
and find a dead body,

21:10.791 --> 21:12.923
and I'm the only one here.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.578
Look, it's no wonder
you're so upset.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.841
I mean, you almost died.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.887
What?

21:19.930 --> 21:22.019
The Great Khan sent one
of his foot soldiers.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.544
He barged into the tent
and murdered Kate.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.634
I mean, it's a miracle
you're still alive,

21:27.677 --> 21:29.853
but thank God you are,

21:29.897 --> 21:31.899
'cause you did what you needed
to do, and lucky you did.

21:31.942 --> 21:34.249
Otherwise, Danny and Lexi
would be dead, too.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.077
They actually
owe their lives to you.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.427
What if they don't believe me?

21:38.471 --> 21:40.211
What if hedoesn't believe me?

21:40.255 --> 21:41.996
Well, you better
make it look convincing.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.041
But if you kill Danny
in front of Lexi,

21:44.085 --> 21:45.695
you've lost her forever,

21:45.739 --> 21:47.218
and you've made
a very powerful enemy.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.745
Send me someone I don't need.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.790
And Simon, if this fails...

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.011
Head on a pike. I know.

22:03.626 --> 22:06.194
I just got a message
from the Khan.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.457
She has a special mission.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.720
She told me
to send her best man.

25:20.649 --> 25:23.957
Hello. Um, Jamukha?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.959
Do you know Jamukha?

25:26.002 --> 25:27.830
Does that mean anything?

25:27.874 --> 25:29.397
Uh, look-looks delicious.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.965
Uh, um, English?

25:32.008 --> 25:34.402
[speaks Russian]

25:35.403 --> 25:36.796
Um...

25:36.839 --> 25:40.495
I mean... if you insist.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.760
Oh. That's very good.

25:44.804 --> 25:46.501
That is very good.

25:50.026 --> 25:52.768
Danny McNamara.

25:52.812 --> 25:56.337
I'm Weber, the local rep
from Langley. How can I help?

25:56.380 --> 25:58.339
Did you find Kate?

25:58.382 --> 26:00.471
We did.

26:00.515 --> 26:03.170
They tell me she was one
of the best of our new batch,

26:03.213 --> 26:06.347
that she meant something
to you. I am sorry.

26:06.390 --> 26:09.002
I think the woman

26:09.045 --> 26:11.439
my partner and I are with
is working with the Khan.

26:11.482 --> 26:14.877
Is she the Middle Eastern girl
or the Asian one?

26:16.183 --> 26:18.054
I've had eyes on you guys
since you got to town.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.970
Asian.

26:21.014 --> 26:24.017
Lexi's with me.
And as far as she's concerned,

26:24.060 --> 26:26.149
you and I
don't know each other.

26:26.193 --> 26:28.151
Okay.

26:28.195 --> 26:30.632
So, you want your girlfriend's
friend rendered

26:30.676 --> 26:32.634
to a black site
right in front of her.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.941
That is cold, man,
but I can dig it.

26:34.984 --> 26:37.117
Well, I don't see
any another way.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.076
There's an abandoned mining
operation just outside of town.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.339
There's no one around,
easy to control.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.428
You get her there,

26:44.472 --> 26:47.214
and my team will get her out,
nice and clean.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.304
I need her alive.

26:50.347 --> 26:53.263
Don't worry.
"Alive" is our specialty.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.657
[phone chimes]

26:55.701 --> 26:58.181
Oh, I just
texted you coordinates.

26:58.225 --> 27:00.357
Good luck.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.064
Fancy meeting you here.

27:11.107 --> 27:13.457
You said you have information.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.372
Yeah, well, if Danny's
right about Jamukha,

27:15.416 --> 27:17.723
there's a very big chance
the Banner's actually here,

27:17.766 --> 27:19.725
down the road, in fact,

27:19.768 --> 27:21.988
at The Museum Of
Mongolian Artifacts.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.381
You think
the Banner is on display?

27:24.425 --> 27:27.602
No, not on display. Hidden
underneath the museum.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.212
You see, it's relatively new.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.432
It was only built in 1984,
exactly the same time

27:31.475 --> 27:33.869
Jamukha's holy shrine
was supposedly discovered.

27:33.913 --> 27:37.046
I don't know about you, but
I don't believe in coincidences.

27:37.090 --> 27:40.006
So I think the tribesmen
built the museum

27:40.049 --> 27:42.530
over the dig site
to protect the tomb.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.706
That sounds promising.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.882
I hoped you might think so.

27:46.926 --> 27:50.451
And I'll see you there.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.148
Ugh.
So, nothing on my end.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.976
I did try this cheese.
Hey.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.891
Hey.Find anything out?

27:55.935 --> 27:59.286
Yeah, I have a lead.
We need to get out of town.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.505
I thought you said Jamukha's
shrine was in Ulaanbaatar.

28:01.549 --> 28:02.985
I thought so, too,

28:03.029 --> 28:04.726
but an archaeologist I know
told me

28:04.770 --> 28:07.120
about a mining operation
just outside of town.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.949
Sounds like it could be the site
of Jamukha's tomb.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.081
Really? 'Cause I just
talked to a local

28:12.125 --> 28:14.605
that said he thinks it's hidden
underneath the museum.

28:14.649 --> 28:15.911
My source was pretty confident.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.870
I don't think we
should waste any time.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.046
Waste time? The museum's
right around the corner.

28:20.089 --> 28:21.787
How is that wasting time?

28:21.830 --> 28:24.964
Okay, okay. Hey, why don't we
go to the museum first?

28:25.007 --> 28:27.880
If there's no Banner,
we head out of town.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.359
Yeah.Sound good?

28:29.403 --> 28:31.448
Yeah.Yeah?

28:35.757 --> 28:37.585
I don't think this is the place.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.195
Why?If this is sacred ground,

28:39.239 --> 28:41.676
there should be guards here.
It's empty.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.813
I just don't want us
walking into another trap.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.292
[grunting]

28:52.382 --> 28:53.775
Still think it's a trap?

28:53.819 --> 28:54.950
Help me
hide him.

28:55.951 --> 28:58.345
Was that
absolutely necessary?

28:58.388 --> 29:00.129
Well, he could have
called a hundred others.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.436
He'll wake up
in a few hours.

29:05.134 --> 29:06.353
DANNY:
There's something
behind these doors

29:06.396 --> 29:07.789
that's worth protecting.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.750
Let's find out
what it is.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.319
Hey, why don't you stay
out here, keep lookout?

29:16.363 --> 29:19.061
Hey, why don't
youdo that?

29:27.678 --> 29:30.333
VIOLET:If it's here, it should
be underneath the museum.

30:02.931 --> 30:06.065
Oh. Danny, my flashlight.Huh, yeah.

30:06.108 --> 30:07.936
Mine, too.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.271
This--

30:38.314 --> 30:40.839
this is incredible.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.853
Oh, my.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.335
Look at this.

31:16.439 --> 31:18.485
It's Jamukha.

31:19.442 --> 31:22.054
Nice belt.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.274
Looks like
solid gold.Mm-hmm.

31:25.318 --> 31:28.843
Genghis gave it to Jamukha
when they were boys

31:28.887 --> 31:31.846
as a token of
their brotherhood.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.203
â™ª

31:55.043 --> 31:57.437
The Soul of Genghis Khan.

32:07.751 --> 32:10.189
[speaks foreign language]

32:10.232 --> 32:12.017
What are you doing?

32:12.060 --> 32:13.322
I'm setting this right.

32:13.366 --> 32:16.499
This is for you
and me, not him.

32:16.543 --> 32:19.154
You put the CIA on me, Danny?

32:19.198 --> 32:21.374
What... What's going on?

32:21.417 --> 32:24.768
Violet, put the
bloody gun down.

32:24.812 --> 32:27.249
Oh. You didn't tell her?

32:28.642 --> 32:29.991
He's been working with Kate

32:30.035 --> 32:31.471
behind your back
this whole time.

32:31.514 --> 32:32.951
That's why
I killed her.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.387
What's she
talking about?

32:43.874 --> 32:46.747
And why am I not surprised
to see you here?

32:47.878 --> 32:49.141
Right.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.665
How does the line go, Danny?

32:55.799 --> 32:57.758
"Again, we see

32:57.801 --> 32:59.629
"there is nothing
that you can possess

32:59.673 --> 33:02.893
which I cannot take away."

33:14.688 --> 33:17.430
You're working for the Khan?

33:17.473 --> 33:19.736
I don't work for anybody.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.438
She is the Khan.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.048
What?

33:29.442 --> 33:32.749
I knew.
After Kate.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.490
I knew you
were involved

33:34.534 --> 33:36.188
with the Khan, but...You...

33:36.231 --> 33:37.972
you knew?

33:39.713 --> 33:42.629
And you didn't tell me.

33:42.672 --> 33:45.023
I guess we both
have our secrets.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.503
Let's discuss this

33:47.547 --> 33:49.592
more upstairs, shall we?

33:56.251 --> 33:58.906
Double-check
the restraints on her.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.864
And search them for
weapons. She usually

34:00.908 --> 34:02.301
carries a knife in her boot.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.218
Ah.

34:06.261 --> 34:08.220
I taught you this little trick.

34:08.263 --> 34:11.266
Nice to know at least
something stuck.

34:11.310 --> 34:12.876
He's got two phones.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.661
I want them both.
I don't want your boyfriend

34:14.704 --> 34:16.880
texting the CIA again.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.969
That's my phone key.

34:20.275 --> 34:23.191
You lifted it off me?

34:23.235 --> 34:24.627
I had to get into Kate's phone.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.064
When did you...

34:27.413 --> 34:29.676
When I hugged you?

34:29.719 --> 34:33.419
When I comforted you?

34:33.462 --> 34:35.769
There is no mining operation
outside of town, is there?

34:35.812 --> 34:37.597
Just a couple
of guys waiting

34:37.640 --> 34:39.860
to throw me into a van
and take me to a black site.

34:39.903 --> 34:41.514
You murdered Kate.

34:41.557 --> 34:44.430
Yeah, well, she figured it out.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.258
How long were you and
Kate planning all this

34:46.301 --> 34:47.694
behind my back?

34:47.737 --> 34:49.391
I don't know,
Lexi. All these

34:49.435 --> 34:52.873
secrets and lies--
seems like a dealbreaker to me.

34:52.916 --> 34:54.353
LEXI:
Don't you dare.

34:54.396 --> 34:56.746
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.184
You know, the old Lexi would
have been right by my side,

34:59.227 --> 35:01.186
but you've been domesticated.

35:01.229 --> 35:04.014
I needed to know
where you stood.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.993
[sighs]

35:40.007 --> 35:41.530
Why didn't you tell me?

35:41.574 --> 35:43.097
I couldn't risk
you talking to Violet.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.317
After everything
we've been through...Lexi.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.407
You seriously thought I'd take
the side of a mass murderer?

35:48.450 --> 35:51.932
Violet has everything
she needs to pull off her plan.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.281
We can't let her leave here
with the Banner.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.109
Yeah, and how do you
expect to stop her?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.893
I'm going to kill her.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.549
Mm.You're what?

36:03.291 --> 36:04.727
Last year,[groans]

36:04.771 --> 36:06.120
when we were going
after Farouk,

36:06.164 --> 36:07.817
was it not you trying
to convince me

36:07.861 --> 36:09.384
that even if
we killed him,

36:09.428 --> 36:11.734
his followers would still
carry out his plan?

36:11.778 --> 36:13.823
How is this
any different?

36:19.264 --> 36:21.309
Look,

36:21.353 --> 36:23.485
if I can get her alone,

36:23.529 --> 36:25.487
I can get her to
give up her plan.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.881
Lexi, she will kill you.She will kill you.

36:27.924 --> 36:29.448
You heard her.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.145
She wants me to
go with her.No, you can't.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.147
You can't do that.Why? Because you
don't trust me?

36:33.191 --> 36:35.715
Because I don't trust her.

36:35.758 --> 36:38.587
The Spirit Banner is real.

36:38.631 --> 36:39.936
Oh, goody.Hey.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.982
Perfect.

36:42.983 --> 36:45.028
[whistles quietly]

36:45.986 --> 36:48.554
Did you lift that
off me, too?

36:48.597 --> 36:51.687
No.
I started carrying my own.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.182
[grunting]

37:08.226 --> 37:09.618
Stop!

37:09.662 --> 37:11.490
Lex, get out
of the way.

37:14.057 --> 37:15.494
No.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.897
Lexi... get out of the way.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.595
I said no.

37:29.638 --> 37:30.944
SIMON:
Uh,

37:30.987 --> 37:32.554
guys, it this
strictly necessary?

37:32.598 --> 37:34.991
Shut up, Simon.Shut up, Simon.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.471
What happened to you?

37:36.515 --> 37:38.647
I'm the same person
I've always been.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.954
You're the one
who's changed.

37:40.997 --> 37:43.304
All because of him.
And the worst part is

37:43.348 --> 37:46.002
he doesn't even
trust you.

37:46.046 --> 37:49.615
But I do. Because I know you,
the real you.

37:49.658 --> 37:52.966
If that's true, then prove it.

37:53.923 --> 37:57.187
Take me with you
in exchange for him.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.018
You're trying to manipulate me
to learn my plan.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.064
But I wantyou
to know my plan.

38:04.107 --> 38:05.457
Why?

38:05.500 --> 38:07.589
Because when you do,
you'll understand

38:07.633 --> 38:09.896
and you'll want to join me.

38:09.939 --> 38:12.028
Lexi, do not
listen to her.

38:12.072 --> 38:15.031
He's afraid 'cause
he knows I'm right.

38:16.032 --> 38:20.210
Truth is, I always thought
we'd end up doing this together.

38:20.254 --> 38:24.476
You and me, taking
the world by storm.

38:24.519 --> 38:27.087
It's everything
we've always dreamed about.

38:30.786 --> 38:32.788
Promise me you won't hurt him.

38:32.832 --> 38:36.096
If I wanted to hurt him
he'd be dead already.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.884
Okay, Vi.What?

38:41.928 --> 38:44.539
Okay. You and me then.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.802
DANNY: No.Good.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.155
Lexi.I don't want him
calling for help.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.114
Damn it!So we're gonna take him

38:54.157 --> 38:55.855
with us and leave him
at the airfield.

38:55.898 --> 38:58.074
The hell you are.Danny.

38:58.118 --> 38:59.728
[mouthing]

38:59.772 --> 39:02.383
I won't hurt him if he
doesn't do anything stupid.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.211
You have my word.

39:04.254 --> 39:07.214
All right. All right, deal.

39:07.257 --> 39:09.259
[sighs]
Simon, we're leaving.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.305
Be a doll
and collect our treasure.
