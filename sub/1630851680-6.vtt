KEITH: Mr. Roy,
we'd like to move on

01:38.264 --> 01:40.725
to the matter
of these illegal payments.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.102
Uh-huh. Fine.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.980
I mean, we've done that, but...
Uh-huh.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.024
KEITH: Specifically, your...

01:48.107 --> 01:50.360
first-hand knowledge
of what happened.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.821
Yup. Yup, got it.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.656
What we want you
to explain to us,

01:54.739 --> 01:56.699
based on what you saw and heard,

01:56.783 --> 02:00.495
is how these illegal payments
were made, were approved,

02:00.578 --> 02:02.330
-and by whom.
-Yup. Got it.

answer the question?

Okay, fine. Uh...

02:18.429 --> 02:21.558
Well, I approved
the illegal payments, because...

02:21.641 --> 02:25.019
I love sexual assault
and I love to cover it up.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.481

Is that bad?

02:28.565 --> 02:29.858
-Okay, we can-- we can wrap up.
-That's bad?

We'll privately run the--

02:31.526 --> 02:33.486

one billion pages of documents,

03:20.867 --> 03:22.952

former DOJ types

-Once you pull everything out

those objections, right?

So, you're saying
the papers are bullshit?

I'm just saying they lack
some of the explosiveness

they might have.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.391
That's not--
That's not really how it works.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.393
Yeah, no, sure, but yeah.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.895
(HESITATES) But is that,
like, constitutional?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.188
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Oh, I don't know, Greg.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.398
You wanna call a referee?

11:30.481 --> 11:31.899
Is there an ombudsman
in the house?

11:31.982 --> 11:34.068
-Well. Here they are.
-GREG HIRSCH: What is
an ombudsman?

11:34.151 --> 11:36.612
The family who lost us
a presidency.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.407
(SMACKS LIPS) How is he?
The Raisin.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.075
He's out of a job in six months,

11:41.158 --> 11:43.786
lame in the interim,
and the GOP is in flames.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.162
We're all doing backflips.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.288
ROMAN: Sorry about that.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.957
LOGAN:
He's got a serious condition.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.917
We felt the country
needed to know.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.628
-MICHELLE-ANNE: Oh.
-So, uh, what are you hearing?

11:52.711 --> 11:55.381
Well, with the president out,
we need a nominee.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.966
-So welcome to Clown Town.
-(SHIV CHUCKLES)

11:57.049 --> 11:59.510
Six months to election day
and no candidate.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.971
Super Tuesday's gone,
ballots are already finalized.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.182
The delegates will choose
at the RNC, of course, but...

12:05.266 --> 12:06.517
I think we can all be real

12:06.600 --> 12:08.727
and say we need
to choose here first.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.355
It's Boyer, right?
We're going Boyer?

12:11.439 --> 12:15.234
Yup. Cleanest option
is the vice president.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.902
The party needs to be united.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.863
So I hope, since you started
this mess,

12:18.946 --> 12:20.030
you can help us clear it up?

12:20.114 --> 12:22.741
-Dave's good. I like Dave.
-We all like Dave.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.453
Steady old plow horse.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.581
NATURAL GAS EXEC:
I heard his daughter
has made him go vegetarian.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.624
-Did you hear that?
-No.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.502
No. Oh, no. I think
I've seen him eat a meatball.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.590
(CHUCKLES) Nope.
Secret herbivore. Right here.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.177
-Boyer, it's his turn.
-Mm-hmm.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.097
I don't really mind
the lip-licking thing.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.267
No?

12:49.351 --> 12:52.021
-Is it bad?
-Not really. It's-- It just--

12:52.104 --> 12:54.064
When you notice it,
you definitely...

12:54.148 --> 12:55.316
notice it.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.318
As long as he doesn't do it
much during the debates,

12:57.401 --> 12:58.777
we should be fine.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.155
GLYN: Guy must have
the wettest lips
in North America.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.907
Yeah, it's like he's
a cartoon bear

13:02.990 --> 13:05.159
and there's always
a picnic hamper nearby.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.744
Yeah, but Dave's great.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.162
Congratulations, by the way.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.538
Oh, okay.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.082
Uh, for what? (SCOFFS)
What have I done now?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.375
GLYN: For the wedding.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.962
Your mother.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.714
Your mother
is Caroline Collingwood, no?

13:18.797 --> 13:20.341
-Yeah...
-And she's getting married, no?

13:20.424 --> 13:21.884
-(ROMAN CHUCKLES)
-To Peter Munion?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.344
No. No, she's in a relationship

13:23.427 --> 13:26.096
with a canoe-shaped
gentleman named Rory.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.348
GLYN: Nope.

13:27.431 --> 13:30.017
Maybe it was somebody else,
then. Pretty su-- No!

13:31.810 --> 13:33.479
Oh! Look at that!

13:33.562 --> 13:35.356
Um... (CHUCKLES)
You know how it is.

13:35.439 --> 13:39.318
Families. (CHUCKLES) Could you
forward that to me, actually?

13:39.401 --> 13:41.862
Thank you. I'll, uh,
see you around. Thank you.

13:41.946 --> 13:42.863
GLYN: Okay.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.615
Hey, could you excuse us
for just a moment?

13:44.698 --> 13:46.867
-Certainly. Certainly.
-Thank you so much.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.203
Did you know about this,
you withholding bitch?

13:49.286 --> 13:50.955
SHIV: Uh, what?

13:51.038 --> 13:53.040
You know, Glyn,
the, uh, Brexit pervert?

13:53.123 --> 13:54.542
Yeah, he just sent this to me.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.919
Apparently, our mother
is marrying a Peter Munion.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.838
-What? Who's Peter Onion?
-I don't fucking know.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.423
Wonder if that first-born fucker
knew.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.925
SHIV: Mm-hmm. Call him.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.094
(PHONE RINGS)

14:05.177 --> 14:06.762
Sorry, just give me a second.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.098
Yeah, what?

14:09.181 --> 14:11.642
ROMAN: I'm here with Shiv.
Just wanted to let you know
new dad just dropped.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.602
I'm sorry, what?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.396
Yeah, Mommy's
getting remarried, dingus!

14:15.479 --> 14:16.981
-Did you know?
-Of course he didn't know.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.148
Ken bores the shit out of Mom.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.692
KENDALL: What are you
even talking about?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.860
You mean, uh, Rory?

14:21.944 --> 14:24.196
SHIV: Uh... No.
She took the view, "Fuck Rory."

14:24.280 --> 14:26.574
KENDALL: Hey, Shiv, is it true?
You at the hate-fest fest?

14:26.657 --> 14:28.200
Burning books
and measuring skulls

14:28.284 --> 14:30.369
-down in Nuremberg, Virginia?
-Yeah.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.830
What are you doing
with your weekend?

14:32.913 --> 14:34.623
Planning to send us all to jail?
Your favorite?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.292
All right. Just, uh,
wanted to let you know

14:36.375 --> 14:38.627
Mommy still doesn't love you.
Bye, Ken, bye.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.549
Hey, man, I--
I just wanted to, uh,

14:43.632 --> 14:45.009
broach something with you.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.343
Broach away, Greg.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.680
So, yeah, look, I'm--
I'm pretty anxious. Um...

14:50.681 --> 14:53.142
Ken is saying he might burn me.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.021
Are you threatening me?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.314
You can't threaten me.
I'm immune.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.650
No, Tom, I was just
thinking about advice.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.860
Because I'm...

15:02.943 --> 15:07.531
(WHISPERS) I'm obsessing
over the "prison" of it all.

15:07.615 --> 15:11.076
And, uh, I just need to know
how to stop thinking.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.745
-Yeah.
-It's just constant.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.788
I tried that. Doesn't work.

15:14.872 --> 15:19.209
No, what I'm preferring
is to always think about it.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.046
And then, when you don't,
for a moment, it's like,

15:22.129 --> 15:25.883
"Ooh! Someone's loosened
their icy grip on my innards."

15:29.219 --> 15:30.262
Yeah.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.680
I like that. I like it.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.184
So, you wanna try?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.270
-SHIV: Mm-hmm?
-It's the Spätburgunder.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.189
Our vineyard!

15:42.316 --> 15:45.569
Oh, screw top. Oh.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.864
JERYD MENCKEN: ...Black
and brown avatars to smear...

15:48.947 --> 15:50.574
SHIV: Do you hear
Boyer's losing juice now?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.368
-TOM WAMBSGANS: Uh-huh.
-REPORTER:
And the Democratic Party...

15:52.451 --> 15:54.078
TOM: So, it's biodynamic.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.831
(SNIFFS) It has quite a funk
to it.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.376
MENCKEN: ...engineered
by the DNC and the LSM

16:00.459 --> 16:03.879
in conjunction
with their Big Tech overlords.

16:03.962 --> 16:04.922
Now, the rest of us...

16:05.005 --> 16:06.965
You kind of have to
meet it halfway, right?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.384
-It's...
-SHIV: You know, it's...

16:08.467 --> 16:11.220
-(INHALES) ...earthy.
-TOM: Yeah.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.180
Kinda... Mm...

16:13.263 --> 16:14.556
-Germanic.
-Yeah.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.768
There's lots to unpack. It's--
It's not-- It's not floral.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.229
It's not sugary or...

16:20.979 --> 16:21.897
vegetal.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.525
It's-- It's-- It's...
(SNIFFS) Mm.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.943
It's quite agricultural,
you know.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.696
It's-- It's-- It's-- It's--
Uh...

16:28.779 --> 16:30.322
MENCKEN: Right?
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

16:30.406 --> 16:31.407
You know you're not a bigot...

16:31.490 --> 16:33.742
It's not very nice, is it?
The wine, Shiv?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.035
REPORTER: It's true.
We see this a lot,

16:35.119 --> 16:37.037
-this so-called apology...
-You know,

16:37.121 --> 16:40.791
if Boyer flames out,
then maybe it's time to...

16:40.874 --> 16:42.042
It might be time to pivot party.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.919
So, my prison consultant called

16:44.002 --> 16:46.088
and it looks like
the place upstate might be full.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.590
MENCKEN: ...disempower
the white working class...

16:48.674 --> 16:49.675
SHIV: Mm-hmm?

16:49.758 --> 16:51.927
-It's all the same.
-Well, you're tired.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.012
You'll feel better about that
in the morning.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.097
Oh, yeah?

16:55.180 --> 16:58.142
One day closer
to my incarceration, right?

16:58.225 --> 17:02.146
Apparently, the food in jail
is really bland. Um...

17:03.480 --> 17:04.606
I mean, I know it's the same...

17:04.690 --> 17:06.066
-Tom!
-...every day, but it's--

17:07.985 --> 17:10.195
I don't get why you keep
wanting to talk about it.

17:10.612 --> 17:11.864
Oh.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.991
(LAUGHS) Okay, I'm sorry.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.243
Does the topic of my imminent
imprisonment bore you?

17:16.326 --> 17:18.954
SHIV: Come on! You're just--
You're obsessing! I just--

17:19.038 --> 17:21.331
I can't keep going
round and round, okay?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.834
(INHALES, SIGHS)

17:31.675 --> 17:34.094
Honey, I don't know
what else there is to say.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.267
I'm sorry.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.855
-Hey...
-Hey.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.288
No? (CHUCKLES)

18:01.872 --> 18:03.707
TOM: Oh, sure. Yeah.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.001
Okay.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.961
You know what?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.630
(WHISPERS) There's not really
any point.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.717
Uh... To making love?

18:13.801 --> 18:15.886
Yeah, well,
you're still on contraception.

18:15.969 --> 18:20.015
It's just like throwing so much
cake batter at a brick wall.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.563
WILLA: I think what I realized
is that I'm just

18:26.647 --> 18:29.900
not that interested in being
a commercial playwright.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.902
I mean, the audience helped you
discover that,

18:31.985 --> 18:32.986
didn't they, babe?

18:33.070 --> 18:34.404
Well, beauty and brains!

18:34.488 --> 18:35.489
-(LAUGHS)
-(CHUCKLES)

18:35.572 --> 18:37.282
Probably shouldn't say that.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.617
Uh... Will I be canceled?

18:38.700 --> 18:41.495
(LAUGHS) Oh, no! No. No.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.288
Well, who knows? You know?
The night is young.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.208
Yeah... Yeah, I-- I just--
I don't know how you do it.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.545
How do you make up things
that aren't already there?

18:49.628 --> 18:51.046
CONNOR ROY: Oh, you don't know
the half of it.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.965
We talk long into the night.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.758
Ideas...

18:54.842 --> 18:58.178
literary, global,
macro, micro, cosmo!

18:58.262 --> 18:59.847
We bounce off each other.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.348
Well, that sounds delightful.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.891
(ALL LAUGH)

19:02.975 --> 19:04.226
CONNOR: No. I mean, well, yeah.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.435
-Con.
-(LAUGHTER)

19:05.519 --> 19:08.021
Well, you should come
to Pound Ridge one weekend.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.940
-WILLA: Mm.
-Both of you.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.734
Unless you're tired
or busy, one.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.736
One and all. (LAUGHS)

19:14.820 --> 19:15.863
We'd love that,
wouldn't we, chicken?

19:15.946 --> 19:17.364
(LAUGHS) I don't know
if you're invited.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.366
-CONNOR: Oh, ho, ho! (LAUGHS)
-(LAUGHS)

19:19.449 --> 19:21.326
Okay, let me circulate. (GRUNTS)

19:21.410 --> 19:24.830
And I will rehydrate
this gorgeous creature

19:24.913 --> 19:26.331
-on my return.
-Cancelled!

19:26.415 --> 19:27.541
-Ah!
-(LAUGHS)

19:27.624 --> 19:29.710
You! (LAUGHS)

19:32.170 --> 19:33.380
Fun guy!

19:33.463 --> 19:36.466
Con, maybe don't abandon me
upstate with Larry Lech here.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.718
Okay? It's weird.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.928
Very influential!

19:40.012 --> 19:41.263
We're just showing a bit of leg.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.099
-Yeah, my leg.
-The collective leg!

19:44.182 --> 19:45.434
He's a huge donor!

19:45.517 --> 19:47.352
Maybe I don't wanna
donate my body

19:47.436 --> 19:49.563
to political science, huh?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.983
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

20:00.657 --> 20:02.784

20:02.868 --> 20:06.038
Oh, okay. Yeah, it's the, uh--
it's the ghost pepper.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.915
The spicy new flavor. Mencken.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.250
So, what's your deal?
Most people here wanna...

20:10.334 --> 20:11.418
fuck me or kill me.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.669
-Ooh, wow!
-How about you?

20:12.753 --> 20:15.255
I always found it hard to care
about politics, so...

20:15.339 --> 20:17.341
MENCKEN: Mm-hmm? Well, listen.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.926
Here's my party trick,
all right?

20:19.009 --> 20:20.260
Okay.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.762
Tell me who your enemy is...

and you were in the C-suite,

29:57.837 --> 29:59.422
we could mold.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.425
Oh, wow!
Sir, you are very forward.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.885
-SALGADO: Was that forward?
-Mm-hmm.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.678
Get your old man
to make me president.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.931
I'll see to it
that you become CEO,

30:08.014 --> 30:09.933
even if I have
to send your dad to prison.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.269
Wow, that is, uh--
That's very funny.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.646
So, it's decided?

30:14.729 --> 30:17.649
You land this for me,
I send your dad up the river?

30:17.732 --> 30:20.026
Uh... Yeah, I mean, unless...

30:20.109 --> 30:21.236
unless he resigns in a month!

30:21.319 --> 30:23.321
-Clean kill, baby.
-(LAUGHS)

30:23.404 --> 30:25.323
(CLICKS TONGUE, INHALES)
Good stuff.

30:25.406 --> 30:26.824
Okay, very funny!

30:30.286 --> 30:31.913
Look, you want some advice?

30:31.996 --> 30:33.540
Hoard mackerel tins.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.750
I know. Sounds funny, right?
(INHALES DEEPLY)

30:35.833 --> 30:38.336
But you're gonna need them
for bartering.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.255
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.423
Greg, can you?
Will you keep a note?

30:42.507 --> 30:44.842
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, and the toilet.

30:44.926 --> 30:47.845
Your toilet
is your stair machine,

30:47.929 --> 30:50.557
it's your bench,
it's, uh... your fridge,

30:50.640 --> 30:52.100
it's your...
(CHUCKLES) ...lover,

30:52.183 --> 30:54.769
it's-- it's-- it's your brother,
it's your priest.

30:54.852 --> 30:59.274
Oh, and also, most importantly,
it's also your... toilet.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.442
-Okay.
-Right. Right. (LAUGHS)

31:01.526 --> 31:03.570
Yeah, that's-- that--
I mean, that's-- yeah, that's--

31:03.653 --> 31:04.904
So, that's a big part of prison?

31:04.988 --> 31:08.741
(CHUCKLES)
It could be a perfect gentleman.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.368
Could also be
a terrible bastard.

31:10.451 --> 31:11.953
Your toilet can be a bastard?

31:12.829 --> 31:14.789
PETKUS: Key is unity.

31:14.872 --> 31:17.000
If we land a favorite,
I can pool the big money.

31:17.083 --> 31:21.796
But I need to know the messaging
will be there to back me up.

31:21.879 --> 31:24.257
I like him,
but a lot of people are asking,

31:24.340 --> 31:25.341
"Is Boyer a fighter?"

31:25.425 --> 31:26.801
LOGAN: I don't care
about the resume

31:26.884 --> 31:28.678
or ideological purity

31:28.761 --> 31:30.763
as long as they get it

31:31.222 --> 31:32.640
and they pop.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.142
If you're looking
for someone who gets it,

31:34.225 --> 31:35.685
I got your man.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.438
Connor Roy.
He's got a brand name,

31:38.521 --> 31:40.773
war chest, populist appeal

31:40.857 --> 31:43.109
-and he's a fighter.
-CONNOR: Hey, thanks, Pete.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.361
I believe I speak for my father

31:45.445 --> 31:48.031
when I offer
a firm and robust...

31:49.073 --> 31:51.826
-No comment. (CHUCKLES)
-(LAUGHTER)

31:52.619 --> 31:53.620
Sure.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.457
-I could see Connor.
-Sure, I agree.

31:57.540 --> 32:01.377
The sword has been pulled
from the stone, my liege.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.046
SALGADO:
Look at us, playing nice.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.297
People might think
we liked each other.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.257
No. No, what?
Hey, I'm a conservative.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.675
I like tradition.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.843
I doff my cap

32:08.926 --> 32:11.596
to Vice President Boyer's
years of loyal service.

32:11.679 --> 32:12.722
Thank you.

32:12.805 --> 32:15.183
I believe you used to call me
"Martin Van Boring."

32:15.266 --> 32:18.019
Hey! Come on!
No, I still call you that.

32:18.102 --> 32:21.397
Mencken and I may differ
in some areas, but, uh...

32:21.481 --> 32:23.024
we both agree
that this is the party

32:23.107 --> 32:24.692
of the working class now.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.570
-(SHIV SCOFFS)
-BOYER: What? Shiv?

32:27.654 --> 32:30.198
All the riches counties
in America are blue.

32:30.281 --> 32:33.910
The Democrats and Tech
hold all the wealth.

32:33.993 --> 32:36.496
I just think some of us
get so high off owning the libs,

32:36.579 --> 32:37.789
we forget to talk policy.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.874
Yeah, Rick loves to talk policy.

32:39.957 --> 32:41.417
What he does is he memorizes

32:41.501 --> 32:43.878
a National Review issue
from 2012

32:43.961 --> 32:45.880
and then,
he recites it back to you.

32:45.963 --> 32:48.132
-Cool policy, bro.
-And Jeryd hates to talk policy

32:48.216 --> 32:50.802
because it would mean,
you know, having one.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.303
Sick burn, brosef!

32:52.387 --> 32:54.013
MENCKEN: Oh, no, no, no.
We're kidding. We're kidding.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.683
We like each other. I--
I listen to his speeches...

32:56.766 --> 32:58.226
every night.
They help me drop off.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.645
Maybe it's boring talking
about populist solutions

33:00.728 --> 33:02.021
-for working families.
-Rick, come on!

33:02.105 --> 33:03.856
You jerked off
to Reagan's headshot

33:03.940 --> 33:06.109
for 30 years,
and now you're Tom Joad?

33:06.192 --> 33:08.194
Ugh, God!
It's so fucking boring.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.279
-What's that?
-SHIV: Hmm?

33:10.363 --> 33:11.364
What?

33:11.447 --> 33:14.534
No, I've just-- I've seen
your thing quite a lot.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.160
And that-- What's that?
What's my thing?

33:16.244 --> 33:18.413
YouTube provocateur bullshit.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.580
Aristo-populism.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.666
"Rape is natural.
It's all red pill, baby."

33:21.749 --> 33:22.875
I'm just...

33:22.959 --> 33:24.752
(CHUCKLING)
I'm just so fucking over it.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.129
Have you read Plato?

33:27.004 --> 33:28.673
Uh... Yeah.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.216
Remind me. What happens?

33:30.299 --> 33:31.843
Read Plato. Read Plato!

33:31.926 --> 33:34.262
(LAUGHS) Oh, don't want to!
Don't fucking want to.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.848
See, he doesn't actually want
to have a conversation.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.599
-SHIV: Yeah.
-He just wants to yell
loud enough...

33:38.683 --> 33:39.684
-SHIV: Yeah.
-...to get on ATN.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.561
Nah! Fuck ATN!

33:42.895 --> 33:45.982
No, really, ATN is treated
as a bulwark, but it's dead.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.567
It's basically...

33:47.650 --> 33:50.319
a pudding cup at 5:00 p.m.
in the nursing home.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.074
Honestly. Doesn't speak to me.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.577
Doesn't speak to the--
the people that I talk to.

33:57.660 --> 34:03.207
It is status quo bedtime stories
to maximize shareholder value.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.460
No disrespect, Logan Roy...

34:06.711 --> 34:08.588
was an icon, but, you know...

34:09.714 --> 34:11.048
he's no longer relevant.

34:12.925 --> 34:14.969
-You recognize this fucker?
-Nope.

34:15.052 --> 34:18.556
Fucking jelly-boned, low-T,
pip-pip cheerio fucker!

34:19.265 --> 34:20.308
You told Dad yet?

34:20.391 --> 34:21.976
No. We have to stop
the wedding, though. Right?

34:22.059 --> 34:24.103
What? Stop obsessing
over Mom's new husband.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.938
-Just get over it. Who cares?
-Get over it?

34:26.022 --> 34:27.523
It just fucking happened.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.734
My mother is marrying
some dickhead

34:29.817 --> 34:30.860
crooked-toothed turnip man.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.612
What's wrong is how little
you care about it,

34:32.695 --> 34:33.905
-you frozen bitch.
-Poor Rome!

34:33.988 --> 34:35.031
His dreams of porking Mom

34:35.114 --> 34:37.617
slipping through his little
lubed-up fingers.

34:41.078 --> 34:43.372
Hey, so! Come in! Come in!

34:43.456 --> 34:44.791
-Yeah.
-Sit.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.042
Sit.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.752
Is Greg necessary?

34:48.753 --> 34:50.338
Just keep your trap shut.

34:50.421 --> 34:52.924
-Watch.
-All right, thank you, sir.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.510
Minimizing the Greg window.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.678
LOGAN: There's a lot
of chaff flying.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.138
A lot of flapping.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.307
But Ron and me
are going to meet and figure out

35:01.390 --> 35:03.684
how we can pull
for the same name.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.897
We need one voice on this,
or we could fall apart

35:07.980 --> 35:10.399
and hand it to the fuck-fuck
donkey gang.

35:10.483 --> 35:11.776
-(CONNOR CHUCKLES)
-HUGO: Right.

35:11.859 --> 35:12.860
So...

35:14.904 --> 35:16.197
who do we like?

35:17.240 --> 35:19.742
Well, shouldn't we kick it
around a bit?

35:19.826 --> 35:20.910
You know, it feels like
it's poised,

35:20.993 --> 35:23.830
so if you and Petkus
come together and--

35:23.913 --> 35:25.748
and then the other donors
follow, then it's--

35:25.832 --> 35:26.874
Exactly.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.085
We're picking.

35:29.168 --> 35:31.087
We haven't got all night.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.630
I like Connor Roy.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.427
SHIV: Honestly, Dad,
I think you go Dems.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.720
-CONNOR: Wow.
-SHIV: Yeah, I do.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.138
ROMAN: Jesus Christ.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.682
Um, I...

35:42.765 --> 35:44.851
kinda like Mencken, but...

35:44.934 --> 35:48.437
I know he's kind of shitty,
so if it's now, I guess, Boyer,

35:48.521 --> 35:51.023
but can I just say
I don't like Boyer--

35:51.107 --> 35:52.441
-What? What's with the fucking--
-SHIV: Roman.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.193
No disrespect,
but Boyer's yesterday's papers.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.320
The Dems will run on change
and blow him away.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.697
ROMAN: Ooh, Mrs. Politics!

35:57.780 --> 35:59.574
How many big races did you win
as a consultant?

35:59.657 --> 36:01.492
-Four? Three? Did you win two?
-Roman! Boyer is not a winner,

36:01.576 --> 36:02.618
-and we know that.
-One?

36:02.702 --> 36:04.537
Okay, well, then,
should we talk to Mencken,

36:04.620 --> 36:06.956
-see if we can deal?
-The base does like him.

36:07.874 --> 36:08.875
Right?

36:12.044 --> 36:13.504
SHIV: Uh...

36:13.588 --> 36:18.092
look, can I... say something?
Uh... No.

36:18.175 --> 36:22.638
Mencken is an integralist,
nativist fuckhead. He's toxic.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.266
He's "Medicare for all,
abortions for none."

36:25.349 --> 36:26.684
And his idea of diplomacy

36:26.767 --> 36:28.477
is shooting roe deer
with Viktor Orban

36:28.561 --> 36:30.354
and then starting
a trade war with China.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.523
Look, I'm tough. I know that
there's the carnival bark

36:32.607 --> 36:34.233
and then there's
the fucking show, but...

36:34.317 --> 36:36.277
he is outside the American
political tradition.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.779
And I think we have
a responsibility as Waystar...

36:38.863 --> 36:40.489
-ROMAN: (HUMS NATIONAL ANTHEM)

-ROMAN: (CONTINUES HUMMING)
-...American Republic and--

36:42.658 --> 36:43.826
and to the future of--

36:43.910 --> 36:45.411
-Fuck you, Roman!
-Four score years
and whatever...

36:45.494 --> 36:47.121
-SHIV: No, he's talked about--
-...my sister did bring forth

36:47.204 --> 36:48.998
from her bedroom
a cup of milky sputum.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.374
-You done?
-ROMAN: Yeah, done.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.959
He's talked about burning Korans

36:52.043 --> 36:53.336
-and licensing
press credentials.
-Yeah.

36:53.419 --> 36:55.129
He's shifting
the Overton window. (LAUGHS)

36:55.212 --> 36:56.505
SHIV: I'm surprised you know
what that fucking is.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.049
-I do.
-SHIV: He's opening it

36:58.132 --> 36:59.383
-and throwing
union organizers out of it.
-ROMAN: Oh, my God.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.509
Stop Chicken Littling us.

37:00.593 --> 37:01.802
It just makes us
wanna all have a nap.

37:01.886 --> 37:02.929
SHIV: Stop being
a dirty little pixie

37:03.012 --> 37:04.513
whispering swastikas
in Dad's ear.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.307
Boom! There you go again!
So fucking route one!

37:06.390 --> 37:07.975
I'm not saying it's going to be
the full Third Reich,

37:08.059 --> 37:09.352
but I am genuinely concerned

37:09.435 --> 37:11.479
that we could slide into a...
(INHALES) ...into a--

37:11.562 --> 37:13.773
a Russian Berlusconied
Brazilian fuck pile.

37:13.856 --> 37:16.400
You have a trophy husband
and several fur coats.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.027
-I think you're gonna be fine.
-Tom!

37:18.611 --> 37:19.779
Who do you like?

37:19.862 --> 37:21.113
Me? I, uh...

37:21.197 --> 37:22.657
I think Shiv...

37:22.740 --> 37:24.241
Shiv talks a lot of sense.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.618
But I also jibe with Salgado.

37:25.701 --> 37:26.786
Oh, you "jibe" with him?

37:26.869 --> 37:28.287
-Pretty sure that's racist, Tom.
-GREG: May I, uh--

37:28.371 --> 37:30.456
-Sorry, do I get a vote?
-ROMAN: Sure you do, buddy.

37:30.539 --> 37:33.042
You get to vote at the election
with all the other folks.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.418
GREG: (CHUCKLES)
All right, yeah.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.587
Well, I guess, I just feel
like you maybe get a bigger vote

37:36.671 --> 37:38.339
-in here.
-ROMAN: Easy, Castro.

37:38.422 --> 37:42.093
Boyer is likely to be flexible
over the DOJ.

37:42.176 --> 37:43.803
Not if he doesn't win,
which he won't.

37:43.886 --> 37:47.348
Although, we are hearing rumors
that the case is weakening.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.141
And that no one big...

37:49.225 --> 37:52.019
-is likely to do jail time.
-Great.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.897
HUGO: With the notable exception
of Tom, obviously.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.108
-Sorry, Tom.
-No, please, Hugo. Understood.

37:57.191 --> 38:00.820
Look, if you don't go blue, Dad,
then at least we have to be...

38:00.903 --> 38:02.279
-backing Salgado.
-(SCOFFS AND GROANS)

38:03.572 --> 38:05.324
Captain of the Tampa Bay
Cuckaneers.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.118
Uh... Cyd. Sorry.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.577
-Duty calls.
-SHIV: Look, I don't like him.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.329
He's a neocon
pretending to be a Paleocon,

38:10.413 --> 38:12.331
-but he at least talks base,
and...
-TOM: Hello?

38:12.415 --> 38:15.084
-Tom?
-TOM: Uh-huh?

38:15.167 --> 38:16.669
KENDALL:
Where are you right now?

38:17.336 --> 38:18.587
Uh... Virginia.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.341
KENDALL: No, where are you
in the building?

38:24.260 --> 38:25.219
Shiv, can I just say,

38:25.302 --> 38:27.054
and I know that we have had
our differences,

38:27.138 --> 38:30.599
but I do think you are so brave
for picking the brown man.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.059
I think that we should get
you a medal.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.352
-SHIV: Amazing.
-A special medal,
for white women

38:33.436 --> 38:34.603
-who like brown men.
-Just being a racist now.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.355
"I'm a good girl.
I pretend to care about people

38:36.439 --> 38:37.773
'cause no one cares about me."

38:37.857 --> 38:40.234
Oh, yeah, actually, do you have
something you wanna tell Dad?

38:40.317 --> 38:43.154
From Mom? A message that maybe
you could share, Rome?

38:43.237 --> 38:46.282
Uh... Yeah, wow. Fuck you!
Thanks, I do.

38:46.365 --> 38:47.658
I have a message, uh, yeah.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.994
Uh... Mom's getting remarried.

38:50.953 --> 38:51.954
Hmm.

38:52.538 --> 38:53.706
To Bertie Woofter?

38:53.789 --> 38:56.917
Uh... No, to Peter, um...
uh... Pe-- uh-- Munion.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.627
-Peter Munion.
-You're fucking kidding?

39:00.379 --> 39:02.298
The seat sniffer?

39:02.381 --> 39:03.758
(SCOFFS) He's been hanging
around...

39:03.841 --> 39:06.093
-(LAUGHING) ...for forty years.
-Yeah, and, uh, she would--

39:06.177 --> 39:08.012
they would love it, apparently,

39:08.095 --> 39:09.638
if you came
to their big Tuscan wedding.

39:09.722 --> 39:12.433
Ooh! Lah-di-dah! (INHALES)

39:12.516 --> 39:14.518
And they sent you
as messenger boy?

39:14.602 --> 39:16.729
(LAUGHS)

39:16.812 --> 39:19.106
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

39:23.402 --> 39:24.945
-Hey, man.
-TOM: Hey.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.238
Thanks for coming.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.117
SERVER: (CLEARS THROAT) Hey.

39:30.201 --> 39:33.746
So, I will take the, uh,
Griddle Hero special, please.

39:33.829 --> 39:36.123
With double hash browns.
Fully loaded.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.583
And a plain waffle

39:37.666 --> 39:40.044
and a-- and a large cup
of room-temperature water.

39:40.127 --> 39:41.128
Thank you.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.299
Uh...

39:45.382 --> 39:47.009
I might just watch him.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.845
You know that Rasputin would
take a dose of arsenic,

39:49.929 --> 39:53.349
uh, with breakfast each morning
to build up his tolerance?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.769
(INHALES DEEPLY)

39:56.852 --> 39:58.312
Look, so...

40:00.689 --> 40:03.526
I think you know...
I've always liked you, Tom.

40:03.609 --> 40:05.945
Well, I like you too, Kendall.
I mean, I have notes.

40:06.028 --> 40:08.489
-(CHUCKLES)
-Oh, no. I have notes.

40:08.572 --> 40:09.949
I think mine
might be more extensive...

40:10.032 --> 40:12.159
-KENDALL: I don't know. (LAUGHS)
-...than yours. (LAUGHS)

40:12.243 --> 40:15.079
KENDALL: But look. I think
I can get you out of this mess,

40:15.162 --> 40:16.372
where you're going.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.291
TOM: Well, uh...

40:19.375 --> 40:21.001
nothing is certain, so...

40:23.087 --> 40:24.630
KENDALL: You know
they're calling you...

40:24.713 --> 40:26.090
the Christmas tree?

40:27.883 --> 40:28.843
Yeah?

40:28.926 --> 40:31.178
Perhaps that's because
I'm tall and jolly.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.181
KENDALL: Maybe. You think?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.142
But I think maybe you don't want
to be the chip

40:36.225 --> 40:38.519
the company offers up
when it has no choice.

40:39.770 --> 40:40.771
Well...

40:42.064 --> 40:44.650
obviously, I would prefer that
not to happen,

40:45.067 --> 40:46.360
but, um...

40:47.194 --> 40:49.113
-it's complicated.
-KENDALL: It is.

40:49.196 --> 40:51.073
But I'm here to ask,
are you interested

40:51.157 --> 40:53.451
in an alternative,
theoretically?

40:56.162 --> 40:57.663
I have, of late, uh,

40:57.746 --> 41:01.167
decided not to tarry
too much with hope.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.335
Okay, well, my case is...

41:05.296 --> 41:07.715
It's strong. It's--
No, it's-- it's...

41:08.465 --> 41:10.718
(SCOFFS) My case is fine.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.970
It has gaps.

41:14.555 --> 41:15.848
But if I had someone
who could say

41:15.931 --> 41:18.809
that nothing gets signed off on
without my dad's say-so,

41:18.893 --> 41:20.227
which I think we both know
to be true...

41:20.311 --> 41:21.270
-Ooh, I--
-...then--

41:21.353 --> 41:23.272
I don't know
that I do know that, Ken.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.233
Uh-huh.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.736
Yeah, I'm just
a humble servant, Ken.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.160
I admire you, man.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.537
I do, I fucking-- You know?

41:38.621 --> 41:41.040
You-- You-- You're-- Look at--
You're a long way from home.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.667
You're far from the tree.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.255
You've played your hand well,

41:48.339 --> 41:49.882
and you're sitting
at the top table.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.593
Well, shucks. Thank you.

41:52.676 --> 41:55.387
I fell in love with your sister.
That's what happened.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.306
Sure. Oh, yeah.
Right, right, right.

41:57.389 --> 41:58.515
Sure. Sure, man.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.560
The country mouse
and the hot tamale.

42:01.644 --> 42:02.645
(CHUCKLES)

42:02.728 --> 42:04.063
And you're just, uh...

42:05.147 --> 42:06.190
what? Just--

42:06.273 --> 42:08.567
I suppose you're just
a long glass of water.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.403
-No agenda?
-I guess.

42:12.821 --> 42:14.198
KENDALL: Well,
here's how it goes.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.992
I have new lawyers,
who are fucking amazing.

42:17.785 --> 42:18.911
I do not underestimate

42:18.994 --> 42:21.372
the cognitive dissonance
you're experiencing.

42:21.997 --> 42:24.250
Lying, hiding.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.834
But pretty soon,

42:25.918 --> 42:27.211
granted immunity.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.755
And you're not going to prison.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.258
How does that sound?

42:35.219 --> 42:37.346
I guess there are other names.

42:37.429 --> 42:38.430
(COUGHS)

42:39.348 --> 42:41.225
LOGAN: We have to be united
on this.

42:41.308 --> 42:43.978
-It's a disaster if we splinter.
-(COUGHS)

42:44.061 --> 42:45.604
Salgado has great narrative.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.940
Quit butt-huffing Salgado, Shiv.

42:48.023 --> 42:49.942
We all supported
your little DC lemonade stand,

42:50.025 --> 42:51.986
but this is the fucking
real world.
This actually matters.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.237
SHIV: Roman, you just love
the boot

42:53.320 --> 42:55.364
-'cause you love
to be kicked by it.
-(COUGHS)

42:55.823 --> 42:56.949
LOGAN: What?

42:57.783 --> 42:58.951
What?

42:59.034 --> 43:00.202
Nothing. No.

43:01.495 --> 43:02.579
What about Connor?

43:03.330 --> 43:04.415
CONNOR: Interesting.

43:04.498 --> 43:07.167
I do believe that idea
has good promise.

43:07.626 --> 43:08.627
I do.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.421
I could see it.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.381
Well, if you can see it,

43:12.464 --> 43:13.757
should we talk about it?

43:13.841 --> 43:16.427
-LOGAN: Kids?
-Um...

43:16.510 --> 43:17.928
sure, I don't know.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.430
Yeah.

43:21.098 --> 43:22.766
Like, but, like, really?

43:24.476 --> 43:25.477
Uh...

43:26.020 --> 43:27.104
I guess.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.314
Sure. I don't know.

43:28.397 --> 43:30.482
They're all fucking weirdos
anyway, so why not?

43:30.566 --> 43:32.109
-No offense, Con.
-None taken.

43:32.192 --> 43:33.902
I mean, he's a good-looking kid.

43:34.737 --> 43:37.031
He's smart... in his way.

43:37.114 --> 43:40.576
Fucking Joe Kennedy
did it for his boys? (CHUCKLES)

43:40.659 --> 43:41.869
So let's get him in there

43:41.952 --> 43:43.620
with a smile and a shoeshine

43:43.704 --> 43:46.582
and get Ron and everyone
behind him.

43:46.665 --> 43:49.585
I would fight so fuckin' hard
for this family, Pop.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.297
Siobhan?

43:53.380 --> 43:55.549
As a political consultant,
what do you think?

43:55.632 --> 43:57.009
-(HESITATES)
-LOGAN: Come on.

43:57.092 --> 43:59.136
Well-- Okay, well,
not huge name ID,

43:59.219 --> 44:01.055
but the family name
will be a factor and...

44:01.138 --> 44:02.389
A positive. One of many.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.850
Uh... He's got no track record.

44:04.933 --> 44:06.602
Nothing to beat me with.

44:06.685 --> 44:07.936
I'm a clean skin.

44:09.104 --> 44:10.606
And I guess, in terms of...

44:10.689 --> 44:12.691
presentation
and connection skills...

44:12.775 --> 44:13.942
Tick, tick.

44:14.026 --> 44:16.195
-He can walk and chew gum.
-(CHUCKLES)

44:16.278 --> 44:17.946
He pisses pretty straight.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.240
CONNOR: Pretty damn straight.
I piss policy laser.

44:20.324 --> 44:21.950
Okay, um, are we being
serious about this?

44:22.034 --> 44:25.079
We're talking about trying
to make Connor president...

44:25.162 --> 44:27.539
of the United States of America.
Crap pants!

44:27.623 --> 44:29.875
Roman, it's a big tent.
Why don't you just come in?

44:29.958 --> 44:32.294
Sure, I might call
the guy who waxes my balls.

44:32.378 --> 44:33.629
-He's a possible.
-CONNOR: Jesus.

It depends. I-- I think...
(CLEARS THROAT)

44:49.228 --> 44:52.231
I think I could see myself, uh,
spoiling my ballot

44:52.314 --> 44:54.108
-in his favor. (HESITATES)
-(CHUCKLES)

44:54.191 --> 44:55.901
Depending on the opposition.
Yeah.

44:55.984 --> 44:57.361
LOGAN: What do you think, Shiv?

44:57.444 --> 44:58.904
Is it nuts?

44:58.987 --> 45:00.531
I love Con. I do. But...

45:00.614 --> 45:03.450
if-- if we're talking about this
seriously, I think we have to...

45:04.326 --> 45:05.452
look at Salgado!

45:05.536 --> 45:07.329
-Can I bring him up here?
-Oh, come on.

45:07.413 --> 45:09.998
(SMACKS LIPS) Hugo. Call Boyer.

45:10.082 --> 45:12.584
Okay, if-- if she's bringing up
Soggy Salgado,

45:12.668 --> 45:14.503
then I want to see
if we can tame Mencken, okay?

It's Logan.

45:26.223 --> 45:27.266
How are you?

45:27.349 --> 45:30.519
BOYER: Uh... G-- Good, Logan.
How are you?

45:30.602 --> 45:32.730
LOGAN: Oh, I'm fine.
We're all fine.

45:32.813 --> 45:34.398
I'm here in my suite.

45:34.481 --> 45:36.859
Uh... Would you fancy
stopping by?

45:36.942 --> 45:38.569

Uh, it's pretty late, Logan.

45:39.194 --> 45:40.195

45:43.323 --> 45:44.783
BOYER: But s-- sure. Sure.

45:44.867 --> 45:47.828
Great. Great.
And Dave, listen, um...

45:48.829 --> 45:50.789
my fridge is bare.

45:50.873 --> 45:53.125
I don't suppose you could
run me over a Coke?

45:54.460 --> 45:56.044
BOYER: Did you mean
to call room service?

45:57.379 --> 45:58.714
If you don't have a Coke,

45:59.339 --> 46:00.757
is there something else?

46:01.592 --> 46:03.093
BOYER: Yes?

46:03.177 --> 46:06.555
Could you fire
the deputy attorney general?

attorney general?

Come on over.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.109

If it's convenient.

I'll be over in a few minutes.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.491
LOGAN: (INHALES)
Thank you, Hugo.

46:25.574 --> 46:29.828
-Take the boy and go.
-Um... Yeah. Yeah.

46:29.912 --> 46:33.207
I-- I-- I will go. I--
I just want to say, I think...

46:33.874 --> 46:35.501
um...

46:35.584 --> 46:39.546
I-- I-- I think I owe it
to my country to say...

46:39.630 --> 46:43.967
I don't think you should crown--
or make Connor president.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.637
That's it. Thank you.
Good night. Sorry.

46:48.555 --> 46:50.390
So-- So, what do you think?

46:57.064 --> 46:58.774
-Let me think.
-Yeah, take your time.

46:58.857 --> 47:01.026
-I see it's tough for you.
-Yeah.

47:01.109 --> 47:03.278
You know, my dad seems powerful.

47:03.946 --> 47:05.531
Shiv seems safe.

47:06.114 --> 47:07.115
But, uh...

47:09.785 --> 47:12.162
I don't know.
You think she'll still be there?

47:12.246 --> 47:14.122
Waiting for you after prison?

47:17.125 --> 47:19.586
How exactly does it work if I...

47:19.670 --> 47:21.630
if I do come over to you?

47:21.713 --> 47:23.882
I mean, how--
how is it better...
