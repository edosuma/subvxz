00:04.088 --> 00:05.755
it is common to
exchange a small gift

00:05.839 --> 00:08.049

to avoid embarrassment.

always wash your hands
after going to the bathroom.

This is considered
to be polite.

Okay.

an international client,

been intrigued by

that you are from Abu Dhabi.

Hello.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.385
l am ashamed
at your naked face.

Michael on this trip.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.280
But this little perk
really seemed
to turn him around,

02:36.406 --> 02:38.825

to find somebody

02:38.909 --> 02:41.744
who wants to go up
to Winnipeg mid-November.

02:42.204 --> 02:47.375
And business-class air,
like a five-star hotel
in the sky.

Actually better
than a five-star hotel

ls he your boyfriend
or something?

11:30.815 --> 11:35.277
No, but he could be yours

the softest skin
l've ever seen,

12:45.265 --> 12:48.142
