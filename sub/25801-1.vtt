"Sadness will last forever."

01:16.791 --> 01:20.916
That's what Van Gogh said to his
brother, Theo, before he died.

01:21.166 --> 01:25.458
For Nietzsche, the thought of suicide
was a great comfort,

01:25.708 --> 01:28.583
a haven by which
one could survive bad nights.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.375
Maybe that's why, every year,
dozens of people come here.

01:35.083 --> 01:38.166
Far away from everything,
and everyone,

01:38.250 --> 01:40.458
so that sadness ends.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.416
Sadness will last forever.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.708
A little privacy, please!

13:52.333 --> 13:54.666
With such a big forest,
you had to pick my spot.

14:01.583 --> 14:04.291
Sorry, I hadn't seen you.
I'll leave.

14:10.541 --> 14:13.958
Don't you think you're too young
to commit suicide?

14:14.625 --> 14:16.041
Fuck you, old man!

14:16.125 --> 14:19.000
Who commits suicide with a knife?
Are you fucking japanese?

14:19.500 --> 14:20.708
Get lost!

14:31.666 --> 14:34.041
May I recommend you a spot
for your "hara-kiri"?

14:35.750 --> 14:37.541
Don't tell me you're mad.

14:38.708 --> 14:41.458
Look, if I wanted to be insulted,

14:41.833 --> 14:44.375
I would've stayed at home,
with my wife and daughter,

14:44.458 --> 14:47.666
who's about your age
and just as rude as you.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.375
If I came here, it's because
I don't want to deal with that.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.500
I want peace.
Leave me alone, okay?

14:53.583 --> 14:55.125
I'm sorry, okay?

14:56.041 --> 14:59.500
Why do you want to commit suicide
with your age?

15:00.125 --> 15:03.416
What could you possibly have done
so wrong that you can't fix it?

15:04.208 --> 15:07.333
The future is nothing more
than old age, illness and pain.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.500
- I'm not interested.
- What a clichÃ©.

15:11.375 --> 15:14.791
Are you one of those conceited
teenagers and artists?

15:15.416 --> 15:16.916
- A "hisster"?
- A hipster?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.458
- Yes.
- You're so lame.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.000
Did you know that according
to the Conviction Theory,

15:22.083 --> 15:25.166
I came much more prepared than you.
- Conviction Theory?

15:25.250 --> 15:27.666
Yes, from the book "A Long Way Down",
by Nick Hornby.

15:27.750 --> 15:30.958
You can find it anywhere. I'm not
a hipster because I read it, okay?

15:31.041 --> 15:35.583
I know the book,
but I don't see your point.

15:35.833 --> 15:39.583
A knife? What are the odds
of you chickening out?

15:40.583 --> 15:42.458
Did you bring an alternative
method of suicide?

15:43.583 --> 15:44.958
- No.
- Poison.

15:46.125 --> 15:49.125
- Sweet and psychotropic.
- Good point.

15:49.833 --> 15:51.625
You're a resourceful girl.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.791
Did you bring a suicide note?

15:56.375 --> 15:59.208
Did you know that 90 percent of people
who end up not doing it

15:59.291 --> 16:01.666
back out because they didn't bring
a suicide note,

16:01.750 --> 16:03.333
and do not have a pen and paper?

16:03.416 --> 16:07.416
You're exaggerating,
but I see your point.

16:08.083 --> 16:09.791
- Did you bring one?
- Of course.

16:10.250 --> 16:13.791
It will make everyone feel guilty.
It even has drawings.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.875
You're right. I must write one.

16:18.708 --> 16:22.125
Can you lend me some paper,
and a pen?

16:28.916 --> 16:32.458
I still think it's a stupid idea,
you wanting to kill yourself.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.916
We will talk about this again, okay?

17:08.540 --> 17:10.000
You shouldn't smoke.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.375
What difference does it make?
I'll die soon.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.708
It's the dumbest way
to commit suicide.

17:14.790 --> 17:18.165
A slow and painful death.

17:19.375 --> 17:20.790
What's wrong with you?

17:22.665 --> 17:24.290
You're the same age
as my daughter.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.915
Writing this has brought me down.

17:28.791 --> 17:31.375
I know it might sound silly,

17:32.083 --> 17:34.458
but you can't kill yourself
with a heavy heart.

17:34.541 --> 17:38.375
Don't you want to go for a walk,
and see the "Forest of Lost Souls"?

17:38.708 --> 17:41.458
- What's there to see here?
- The dead.

17:41.541 --> 17:43.208
Come on. Let's see what we can find.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.500
Wait.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.333
What are you doing?

18:33.625 --> 18:35.958
You don't have to whisper.
No one can hear us here.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.333
Easier than a knife, right?
What do you think?

18:40.166 --> 18:43.291
You're so immature.
That's not funny.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.375
Calm down. I'm sorry.

18:46.833 --> 18:49.250
I thought you were still
picking a method.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.666
Now you're stealing?

18:52.708 --> 18:55.041
What difference does it make to him?
Or to you?

18:57.416 --> 19:00.625
This is my long term suicide plan.
Lung cancer.

19:02.458 --> 19:05.125
This isn't the first time
you've come to this forest

19:05.208 --> 19:07.541
and walked around, is it?
- No.

19:08.291 --> 19:11.375
I'm indecisive by nature.
I come, I leave.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.583
I change my mind.
I come back.

19:13.916 --> 19:18.333
- That's why you're so well prepared.
- You could say I'm an expert.

19:18.416 --> 19:20.875
Do you always steal
what you find here?

19:20.958 --> 19:24.166
It's not stealing. No one cares about
the belongings of who dies here.

19:24.916 --> 19:26.833
Or about these people, by the way.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.375
- But still...
- Don't be condescending.

19:31.708 --> 19:33.875
Everyone comes here for a reason.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.375
Even me and you.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.541
I feel so dumb right now.

20:38.708 --> 20:40.041
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.083
Can we go see the dead now, "daddy"?

21:20.875 --> 21:23.083
Sadness will last forever.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.458
Why would anyone
want to commit suicide with this age?

21:28.833 --> 21:32.166
You think all ages are bad.
Too young, too old.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.375
- You're the only one who can do it.
- Don't be childish.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.333
Maybe it wasn't suicide.
Have you thought about that?

21:38.416 --> 21:41.083
During fascism,
the old were left here to die.

21:41.916 --> 21:44.125
Maybe they're doing it again
due to the crisis.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.583
And how is that supposed
to cheer me up?

21:47.458 --> 21:50.833
At least it will convince you
that living isn't such a privilege.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.375
What is that?

22:48.083 --> 22:51.625
- Baby food?
- You really came unprepared.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.333
Just imagine you stay here
until nighttime,

22:54.416 --> 22:57.291
with all your indecisions.
You'll get hungry.

22:58.458 --> 23:00.833
You wouldn't want
to starve to death, would you?

23:01.958 --> 23:03.875
It's the first step
for you to back out.

23:04.458 --> 23:07.500
It makes sense.

23:08.166 --> 23:12.750
Like I told you, the Conviction Theory
says you're not at all certain.

23:12.833 --> 23:15.375
How did you come up
with baby food?

23:15.833 --> 23:17.208
It's small and cheap.

23:17.458 --> 23:19.666
When I go to Summer Festivals
I always take a few jars.

23:20.041 --> 23:22.125
That way I only spend money
on alcohol and drugs.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.791
As a father, I admire
your management skills,

23:26.625 --> 23:30.291
but condemn your poor choices.
- Thank you very much, "daddy".

23:39.458 --> 23:41.458
This place is astonishing, isn't it?

23:51.875 --> 23:53.833
Do you know "The Sorrows
of Young Werther"?

23:55.208 --> 23:56.333
No.

23:57.541 --> 23:59.958
It's about a boy who seems himself
in a love triangle between him,

24:00.041 --> 24:01.666
his lover and his best friend.

24:02.750 --> 24:05.541
He loves them so much
that he ends up killing himself

24:05.625 --> 24:07.125
so they can be together.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.291
What a stupid decision.

24:10.458 --> 24:13.500
The worst part is that
they don't even attend his funeral.

24:14.541 --> 24:15.833
It serves him right.

24:19.458 --> 24:23.208
For me, the bottom line is:
nobody cares.

24:24.083 --> 24:26.833
The poor sensitive souls
you find here care.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.666
This world wasn't made for them.

24:32.458 --> 24:37.458
For a girl your age,
you read too much sad stuff.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.083
And I smoke.

25:06.041 --> 25:08.958
It's not every day you get
to photograph sadness in person.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.916
How disrespectful!
You photograph the dead?

25:12.333 --> 25:15.583
- What? No! That's terrible.
- You don't?

25:16.625 --> 25:19.125
No. I take pictures of people
I meet here.

25:19.666 --> 25:21.333
Have you met people here before?

25:22.333 --> 25:25.875
Yes, but it's rare,
because the forest is very large.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.958
I've taken photographs
of the lost souls I encountered.

25:29.541 --> 25:33.583
It's my legacy. This stupid film
is my suicide note,

25:34.125 --> 25:35.458
filled with sad faces.

25:38.541 --> 25:40.208
Why do you want to kill yourself?

25:42.833 --> 25:44.333
Because I did everything wrong.

25:45.416 --> 25:49.083
My priorities were all wrong,
my entire life.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.083
I failed my family.

25:53.625 --> 25:58.166
- I'm more useful... gone.
- So you're selfish?

25:59.625 --> 26:01.750
Thank you for your kindness.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.625
You screw your family
and then you kill yourself?

26:04.708 --> 26:06.375
What about you?
Why are you killing yourself?

26:06.916 --> 26:08.291
What will happen to your parents

26:08.375 --> 26:10.208
when they find out their daughter
killed herself?

26:10.875 --> 26:13.041
- Fuck you.
- Won't they miss you

26:13.125 --> 26:15.416
and find out you're here?
- No.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.625
I told them I was going
to a Summer Festival.

26:17.916 --> 26:21.208
I went to see Arcade Fire yesterday.
I only came here this morning.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.666
You don't like the other bands
and so you decided to kill yourself?

26:25.958 --> 26:29.583
How funny! Unlike you,
I'm certain it's what I want.

26:30.041 --> 26:32.125
I have an alibi for the next two days.

26:32.458 --> 26:35.375
I can hesitate as long as I want,
and no one will come looking for me.

26:35.458 --> 26:37.541
Your friends will not notice
you're gone?

26:37.625 --> 26:40.625
The friends I was with yesterday
think I'm with new people today.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.666
- A perfect plan.
- Almost.

26:43.333 --> 26:44.958
I fear people will wonder

26:45.041 --> 26:47.125
why I haven't updated
my Facebook in a while.

26:47.875 --> 26:50.458
But the internet coverage
is very unpredictable in those places.

26:50.541 --> 26:52.041
It's a tragedy.

27:15.875 --> 27:17.333
What are you looking for, "daddy"?

27:18.375 --> 27:21.958
A lake. I know
there's one here, somewhere,

27:22.041 --> 27:24.041
I know where it is.
Why didn't you ask before?

27:24.291 --> 27:30.500
Why? I didn't take you for a guide
of "The Forest of Lost Souls".

27:30.583 --> 27:32.333
You're always underestimating me.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.791
Did you know it's the only glacial
lake of the peninsula?

27:50.458 --> 27:52.125
It's here ever since the Big Thaw.

27:52.958 --> 27:55.250
It doesn't come from a river.
It comes from nowhere.

27:56.916 --> 27:59.625
It's just melted ice
from the Ice Age.

28:00.833 --> 28:04.125
It's always been here,
frozen in time.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.208
But after all...

28:14.875 --> 28:17.000
... why do you want to kill yourself?

28:18.916 --> 28:21.125
I feel certain that I'm going mad again.

28:23.666 --> 28:27.041
I feel I can't go through
another of those terrible times.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.333
And I shan't recover this time.

28:31.291 --> 28:32.916
More idle talk.

28:33.541 --> 28:37.041
That's because I have a shitty father,
just like your daughter.

28:37.958 --> 28:39.083
Wait.

28:40.291 --> 28:41.458
You know...

28:43.291 --> 28:44.833
I think I'm ready.

28:45.625 --> 28:48.125
But you have to promise me
you'll wait another year.

28:50.041 --> 28:52.708
Give your shitty father another year,

28:53.750 --> 28:58.208
give a chance to that thing we call life.
Sometimes things get better.

28:58.291 --> 29:00.916
Fuck you!
You don't get to tell me what to do.

29:02.250 --> 29:03.791
I wanted to ask you another thing.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.541
Besides not killing myself?
I no longer want to.

29:06.625 --> 29:09.458
You've made me lose my will.
I'm going to see The Strokes.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.416
You're boring.

29:13.583 --> 29:16.041
People who commit suicide here
are very boring.

29:17.291 --> 29:19.166
You're no Elliott Smith.

29:19.875 --> 29:22.125
Can you lend me some poison?

29:23.458 --> 29:26.958
The whole knife thing is ridiculous,
and it scares me.

29:28.083 --> 29:31.041
I told you so.
Sure, I'll lend you some.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.166
Will you stay with me?

29:52.083 --> 29:54.916
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

30:29.375 --> 30:30.750
I had a daughter...

30:32.916 --> 30:34.750
She died in this lake.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.458
You remind me of her.

31:24.541 --> 31:25.833
Who? Irene?

31:26.375 --> 31:28.083
She was a stupid little whore.

31:45.458 --> 31:46.875
Here's your "hara-kiri".

34:13.875 --> 34:18.291
Dad: "Filipa, come home.
Sadness can't last forever."

34:58.541 --> 35:00.208
- Yes?
- Hello, sweetie.

35:00.458 --> 35:02.458
- Hi, mom.
- Did he call you?

35:03.375 --> 35:06.541
No. He just sent me
a stupid message.

35:07.250 --> 35:08.583
He sent it to me too.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.791
I'm heading home.
What about you?

35:14.375 --> 35:17.208
- I'll still be a while.
- Okay.

35:20.458 --> 35:24.500
Filipa, go easy on your dad.
He's going through a hard time.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.958
- I have to go.
- Okay.

35:28.916 --> 35:31.416
- Kisses, sweetheart.
- Bye.

36:33.916 --> 36:35.625
This view is such a shame, isn't it?

36:37.041 --> 36:40.041
I imagine what this place looked like
when the bridge was built.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.541
Didn't you know
time destroys everything?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.000
Hi. How are you?

36:49.458 --> 36:52.166
Everything's fine, Tiago.
What about you?

36:57.583 --> 36:59.291
May I walk you home?

37:01.791 --> 37:03.083
In silence?

37:40.833 --> 37:42.083
Goodbye, Tiago.

39:31.833 --> 39:32.958
Dad?

40:40.041 --> 40:43.041
Mom? I'm home, but he's not here.

40:43.125 --> 40:46.708
I'm leaving soon. Just wait.
Don't get worked up, please.

40:46.791 --> 40:49.750
Mom, calm down.
I was just venting.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.375
- Okay. See you soon.
- See you soon.

45:20.625 --> 45:22.583
Hello, sweetheart.
Is he back?

45:22.958 --> 45:25.458
Jesus, mom.
No, he still hasn't showed up.

45:31.166 --> 45:32.583
He's getting crazier every day.

45:32.958 --> 45:35.916
Your dad has a lot on his mind.
Don't mind him.

45:36.625 --> 45:39.583
- He left at 6am, without a word.
- Let him be.

45:39.666 --> 45:42.708
And his car is parked outside.
Didn't you see it?

45:42.791 --> 45:44.791
What? I didn't see it.
Where is it?

45:45.041 --> 45:46.333
By the road.

45:47.625 --> 45:50.250
It's hard to understand
what goes on in his head.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.708
We've all been through it.

45:54.125 --> 45:56.750
Even you, as much
as you don't acknowledge it.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.666
Don't be rude!

46:08.208 --> 46:14.916
Dad: "Can you park the car inside?
The keys are by the door."

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
Mom, I'm going to park the car.
Dad asked me to.

46:33.208 --> 46:36.791
By text. What a sensitive man.

46:37.916 --> 46:39.833
- See you in a while.
- See you.

48:00.500 --> 48:04.541
Tiago: "I'm worried about you.
Can I stop by today?"

48:04.833 --> 48:09.500
Filipa: "Later...
after she passes out drunk."

49:40.791 --> 49:42.541
Did your dad text you again?

49:46.958 --> 49:49.375
No. Typical.

49:50.083 --> 49:51.416
Don't be like that.

49:51.833 --> 49:55.375
If I were like you, where would we be?

49:55.833 --> 49:57.166
We would be the same.

49:59.583 --> 50:01.916
Or I would be less angry,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.166
because I would have someone
to complain about my father.

50:08.458 --> 50:12.791
Look. We all grieve in our own way.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.791
Your dad deals with things
by touching a raw nerve.

50:20.125 --> 50:24.041
- What she did wasn't his fault.
- Not again, please.

50:24.625 --> 50:27.375
- Please stop it.
- You both are ridiculous.

50:28.458 --> 50:31.916
What about me? Where do I stand?

50:36.458 --> 50:40.125
Dad: "It will all be okay.
I love you both."

50:40.583 --> 50:43.250
What does the message say?
Did your dad send it?

50:44.625 --> 50:45.791
Yes.

50:46.916 --> 50:50.833
More bullshit. I've had it.
I'm going to my room.

52:21.875 --> 52:27.416
Filipa: "I was mean to mom again.
I need you here."

53:20.208 --> 53:24.666
Dad: "I'm home.
Come downstairs."

54:25.333 --> 54:29.333
"Dear Filipa, I ask you one last time
that you forgive me.

54:29.625 --> 54:31.791
"For what I did
and what I'm about to do.

54:31.875 --> 54:36.458
"And for failing you when your sister
was alive and also afterwards.

54:36.833 --> 54:42.333
For not being the dad you needed
in such a dark, sad time."

54:43.041 --> 54:48.333
Blah, blah, blah...

55:17.416 --> 55:20.041
Tiago: "I'm at your door."

55:44.041 --> 55:46.958
Who are you and what do you want?

55:47.041 --> 55:49.250
I'm Filipa's friend.
She's expecting me.

55:49.875 --> 55:51.958
No. She's gone to bed.

55:54.458 --> 55:56.875
- And you are...?
- I'm Irene, her sister.

55:57.458 --> 55:59.708
- No, you're not.
- That's right.

56:01.708 --> 56:03.250
Can you get Filipa, please?

56:03.875 --> 56:05.583
Do you want to come in
and go get her?

56:06.750 --> 56:07.875
No.

56:09.083 --> 56:12.208
- Never mind. I'll call her.
- Okay.

01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:58.541
Hi, daddy. How are you?

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.916
Sorry for not calling yesterday.

01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:04.666
You know cellphones never work
in these places.

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:10.791
You saw what? Jesus, dad.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:16.083
Yes, I can post photos
on Facebook.

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:18.666
I just can't call you.
Different networks.

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:24.250
Yes. WI-FI, dad.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:29.208
What about mommy? Is she okay?

01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:38.208
Okay, okay.
Kisses. Bye.

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:56.791
Ricardo Alves, husband and father
of the two victims

01:03:56.875 --> 01:04:00.625
and who was missing for three weeks
was found dead,

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:03.708
and is suspected to be the author
of the two murders.

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:07.708
He's also believed to have fatally
run over Tiago Roxo,

01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:13.416
Filipa's boyfriend, in the vicinities
of the Alves residence. The body...

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:46.541
Sadness will last forever.

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:58.000
Sadness will last forever.

01:05:59.791 --> 01:06:05.000
The more we analyze a funny story,
the sadder it gets.

01:06:05.416 --> 01:06:07.541
Time destroys everything.

01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:10.708
If the idea of suicide
is a great comfort,

01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:17.000
a way to survive bad nights,
away from everything and everyone,

01:06:17.875 --> 01:06:20.541
I'll be here to end your sadness.

01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:26.833
