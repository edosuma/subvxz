00:00.560 --> 00:03.120
(dramatic music)

00:03.120 --> 00:05.400
(electricity buzzes)

00:05.400 --> 00:06.240
[Speaker] This is clearly

00:06.240 --> 00:07.760
a sophisticated terrorist attack.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.280
Stop!

00:09.280 --> 00:10.120
(explosion booms)

00:10.120 --> 00:11.560
It'll take more than a bomb to stop me.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.840
Hello, darling.
(explosion booms)

00:13.840 --> 00:16.320
Hoist by his own petard.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.800
We've lost our two key leads

00:17.800 --> 00:18.960
that could have led us to the group.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.200
What about Alex?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.600
[Speaker] The cause is more
important than any of us.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.600
We have to lose anyone

00:23.600 --> 00:25.680
who represents a threat to our mission.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.920
It's all protecting
your own neck, isn't it?

00:28.920 --> 00:30.280
You don't give a shit about Alex.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.640
You don't give a shit about the victims.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.760
You don't even give a
shit about your team.

00:32.760 --> 00:33.720
Do you know what, I'm done.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.720
I've been given a bomb with instructions

00:36.720 --> 00:39.960
to hand deliver the device
to the London Stock Exchange.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.640
She won't stop until she brings

00:41.640 --> 00:45.600
the entire criminal justice
system crashing down.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.480
It's my time, it's my time.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.320
(bomb beeps)

00:49.320 --> 00:52.240
(explosions boom)

00:56.800 --> 00:59.400
(taser buzzes)

01:01.720 --> 01:04.200
(tense music)

01:23.320 --> 01:25.840
(door clanks)

01:35.739 --> 01:37.739
Do you know who I am?

01:38.780 --> 01:40.780
Of course I know who you are.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.100
Come on then.

01:47.260 --> 01:49.260
Lana Washington.

01:51.140 --> 01:53.140
You're good at your job, aren't you?

01:56.179 --> 01:57.860
At least Alex brought
you to us in the end.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.100
Where is he?

01:59.100 --> 02:01.180
Waiting for you.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.180
Lana.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.500
What are you doing?

02:09.500 --> 02:12.260
[Hope] Our friend Alex
was playing both sides.

02:12.260 --> 02:13.260
It's not true.

02:13.260 --> 02:16.019
[Hope] Leading us to you, you to us.

02:16.019 --> 02:18.300
Hoping we'd cancel each other
out and he'd get away with it.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.100
No.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.300
Trying to ride his luck.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.140
I swear to you, it's not true.

02:22.140 --> 02:25.700
So we may as well see
how lucky he really is.

02:28.220 --> 02:29.700
Don't do this.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.899
Oh, I'm not doing anything.

02:31.899 --> 02:33.980
It's up to you, Lana.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.500
One of these triggers is wired

02:37.500 --> 02:40.459
to the detonator inside Alex's helmet.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.860
The other one isn't.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.620
You're a fucking psycho.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.300
I'm not the one who walks towards bombs.

02:52.459 --> 02:53.339
Choose.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.019
No.

02:55.019 --> 02:57.100
Choose and you live.

02:57.579 --> 02:59.579
Maybe he does too.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.740
Don't.

03:03.740 --> 03:04.740
I'm not doing it.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.820
Even though he betrayed you?

03:08.100 --> 03:10.100
I swear to you, Lana, I never did.

03:10.940 --> 03:11.700
I never.

03:11.700 --> 03:12.780
[Hope] He'd swear on his dead family

03:12.780 --> 03:14.420
if it saved his own skin.

03:14.420 --> 03:15.339
I know what you did.

03:15.339 --> 03:17.140
I saw it.

03:17.140 --> 03:17.980
What?

03:17.980 --> 03:20.820
You pushed Tom Youngblood
down a shaft to his death

03:21.860 --> 03:23.860
while he was helping people.

03:25.860 --> 03:27.860
Huh.

03:32.820 --> 03:33.660
(gun clicks)

03:33.660 --> 03:34.620
Go on, then.

03:34.620 --> 03:35.459
(Alex shouts)

03:35.459 --> 03:38.339
(explosion booms)

03:54.260 --> 03:55.980
You could have saved him.

03:55.980 --> 03:58.220
You just had to choose.

03:58.220 --> 04:01.060
(dramatic music)

04:22.020 --> 04:24.539
(tense music)

04:40.340 --> 04:42.780
(door slams)

05:11.460 --> 05:13.900
(door slams)

05:21.700 --> 05:23.700
She wants a word.

05:25.099 --> 05:27.420
How much do you know about May 1968?

05:28.860 --> 05:31.740
Group of French students
unhappy about single-sex dorms

05:31.740 --> 05:33.300
in the Vietnam War?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.780
They started a wave of protests

05:34.780 --> 05:37.380
that nearly brought
down an entire country.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.460
What, so...

05:39.859 --> 05:42.820
So you and him wanna share a dormitory?

05:44.140 --> 05:46.140
They struck at the right time.

05:46.620 --> 05:48.300
Capitalism was failing.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.740
There was ridiculous inequality.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.340
The workers weren't being paid enough.

05:52.340 --> 05:54.420
Does any of this sound familiar?

05:55.219 --> 05:57.780
Add to that a lying political class

05:57.780 --> 06:00.180
and I think you've got everything you need

06:00.180 --> 06:01.940
to start an uprising.

06:01.940 --> 06:03.060
You can't be serious.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.140
The people are angry.

06:05.460 --> 06:08.340
They just want a push
in the right direction.

06:08.340 --> 06:11.060
Once we overthrow the
government, it's a clean slate.

06:12.180 --> 06:14.180
Right, well, good luck with that.

06:16.420 --> 06:19.180
(Hope speaking in foreign language)

06:19.180 --> 06:21.380
Lana.

06:21.380 --> 06:25.020
Under the streets, there is
the freedom of the beach.

06:26.979 --> 06:28.979
And you're going to help us.

06:29.659 --> 06:31.780
You are going to deliver
the decisive blow.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.180
Sir.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.979
I've just been notified
by protection command

06:40.979 --> 06:42.219
that the home secretary's coming in

06:42.219 --> 06:43.580
for a meeting this afternoon.

06:43.580 --> 06:44.859
That's correct.

06:44.859 --> 06:46.500
She's asked to attend
my 2:00 p.m. briefing

06:46.500 --> 06:48.180
with the heads of section.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.500
Could that not have
been done remotely, sir?

06:51.380 --> 06:52.540
What's your concern?

06:52.540 --> 06:54.099
You don't refuse the home secretary.

06:54.099 --> 06:56.979
Well, I mean, the
raised threat level, sir,

06:56.979 --> 07:00.180
and the fact that our officers
are already being targeted?

07:00.180 --> 07:02.580
I think she'll be safe here, DI Batra.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.620
We've been watching him for a while.

07:08.740 --> 07:09.500
He's the kind of man

07:09.500 --> 07:12.539
whose pride will eventually
give you an opening.

07:12.539 --> 07:14.460
I can't argue with that.

07:14.460 --> 07:17.900
The home secretary's
visit to CTHQ this afternoon

07:17.900 --> 07:19.979
allows us the perfect opportunity.

07:20.900 --> 07:21.620
In one move,

07:21.620 --> 07:24.659
we can decapitate so-called
law and order in this country.

07:24.659 --> 07:26.340
People have a right to know
they don't need to live

07:26.340 --> 07:28.580
with the repression that they're used to.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.820
Instead, they live
in a fair, don't they?

07:32.539 --> 07:34.260
I think you're too
indoctrinated by the system

07:34.260 --> 07:36.060
to comprehend.

07:36.060 --> 07:38.140
I think you use too many big words.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.219
There's no way you're gonna get into CTHQ.

07:43.219 --> 07:44.460
And definitely not gonna get anywhere

07:44.460 --> 07:45.620
near the home secretary.

07:45.620 --> 07:48.540
No, but you will.

07:51.020 --> 07:54.940
I believe you call this
a command operated device

07:54.940 --> 07:56.780
in your line of work.

07:56.780 --> 08:00.740
I phone it, I enter a code, it blows up.

08:02.060 --> 08:04.060
Now?

08:04.700 --> 08:05.820
That amount of explosives,

08:05.820 --> 08:07.900
innocent people will get killed.

08:08.659 --> 08:10.620
But didn't you know?

08:10.620 --> 08:12.420
All cops are bastards.

08:12.420 --> 08:14.420
So what, you want me to walk into CTHQ

08:14.420 --> 08:16.500
with that briefcase?

08:20.260 --> 08:21.380
This is the cleaning company

08:21.380 --> 08:24.180
who have the contract for
central government buildings,

08:24.180 --> 08:26.260
including CTHQ.

08:27.380 --> 08:29.740
Yeah, but it was an Oxford
with a front bencher.

08:30.820 --> 08:34.500
It's how we, well, you get in unhindered,

08:34.500 --> 08:36.580
through the service entrance.

08:37.060 --> 08:39.780
The bomb will go in
there until we're inside.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.300
You'll be in the back with
all the cleaning gear.

08:42.300 --> 08:44.460
Once we're in, you'll be able
to bypass the main security

08:44.460 --> 08:45.300
and head upstairs.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.380
There's no chance I'm doing this.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.980
(dog barks)

09:04.300 --> 09:06.060
[Val] Where have you been?

09:06.060 --> 09:08.140
Out.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.700
You might like to see this.

09:19.700 --> 09:20.500
The whole house is wired.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.060
If they try to leave,
we'll detonate the device.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.780
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

09:26.780 --> 09:29.180
Oh, not before I kill your mum and dad.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.380
(laughs) Easy, Lana.

09:37.220 --> 09:39.220
Easy.

09:39.860 --> 09:43.220
Do what I say and your parents live.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.900
Yeah?

09:47.940 --> 09:49.580
You, uh...

09:49.580 --> 09:51.980
You gonna make the right choice this time?

09:54.500 --> 09:57.260
(dramatic music)

10:13.820 --> 10:15.100
Hello.

10:15.100 --> 10:17.180
[Lana] Dad, it's me.

10:18.260 --> 10:19.380
[Jeff] Lana.

10:19.380 --> 10:20.340
What is it, love?

10:20.340 --> 10:22.420
Listen, Dad.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.540
It's okay, it's okay.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.620
Whatever it is, it's gonna be all right.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.980
Dad, listen, you can't leave the house.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.260
What?

10:34.260 --> 10:36.340
They're watching you.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.380
There's a bomb in your house.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.180
What?

10:42.180 --> 10:43.660
In our house?

10:43.660 --> 10:44.859
Yeah.

10:44.859 --> 10:45.780
It's gonna be fine.

10:45.780 --> 10:47.979
I'm gonna get you out.

10:47.979 --> 10:49.939
So what do we do?

10:49.939 --> 10:51.859
Tell us what to do.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.140
Just...

10:53.140 --> 10:55.219
Just don't leave the house.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.180
Don't call anyone for help.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.579
Just gotta do something for these people.

11:00.579 --> 11:02.660
What?

11:03.500 --> 11:04.300
But they're watching you.

11:04.300 --> 11:05.140
There's cameras.

11:05.140 --> 11:07.219
If you try and leave-
- Lana.

11:08.540 --> 11:10.300
Lana.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.380
What's going on?

11:14.740 --> 11:17.219
(tense music)

11:46.740 --> 11:48.140
How did this happen?

11:48.140 --> 11:49.660
They came yesterday while you were out.

11:49.660 --> 11:50.979
Who?

11:50.979 --> 11:52.060
They said they were from the Met.

11:52.060 --> 11:54.060
It was, it was a precaution or something.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.300
Oh, no, no, no.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.500
Jesus, Val!

11:56.500 --> 11:58.579
How can you be so gullible?

11:58.579 --> 11:59.859
Well, they had ID!

11:59.859 --> 12:01.409
So what?

12:01.409 --> 12:03.049
Lana always says to
check with her before we-

12:03.049 --> 12:04.809
Well, maybe you'd
have bloody remembered,

12:04.809 --> 12:06.409
had you been here.

12:06.409 --> 12:07.890
Hell, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:07.890 --> 12:08.769
And I was under the bloody impression

12:08.769 --> 12:10.370
you couldn't stand the sight of me.

12:10.370 --> 12:12.169
So what, you were just
gonna stay out the way

12:12.169 --> 12:13.090
till it all blew over?

12:13.090 --> 12:15.169
Yeah, well, pretty much, yeah!

12:18.730 --> 12:21.649
I mean, no, I suppose not.

12:24.330 --> 12:27.210
Look, can you at least remember

12:27.210 --> 12:32.289
roughly whereabouts in our
house they installed a bomb?

12:35.730 --> 12:38.250
(tense music)

12:56.450 --> 12:58.450
All right, let's go.

13:09.649 --> 13:11.649
Uh-uh, side door.

13:34.130 --> 13:36.610
(cart clanks)

13:42.130 --> 13:44.610
(door slides)

13:53.330 --> 13:56.330
(suspenseful music)

14:05.010 --> 14:07.610
(light clicks)

14:10.809 --> 14:13.289
(siren wails)

14:20.529 --> 14:23.010
(tense music)

14:50.730 --> 14:54.090
(tense music continues)

15:06.370 --> 15:08.769
(Lana gasps)

15:43.570 --> 15:46.130
(cart rattles)

15:52.330 --> 15:54.330
The back entrance is just over here.

15:57.049 --> 15:59.049
Get ready, Lana.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.730
(tense music)

16:24.890 --> 16:26.890
Stop.

16:28.130 --> 16:30.130
Whoa, watch it!

16:50.169 --> 16:52.169
They've increased security.

16:52.570 --> 16:54.570
There are dogs.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.570
Can you hear me?

16:57.570 --> 16:59.649
What do you expect?

17:00.570 --> 17:02.289
Wait, dogs, are you sure?

17:02.289 --> 17:04.370
Yes.

17:08.770 --> 17:10.690
That, that's risky, that is.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.770
They'll smell the RDX.

17:21.489 --> 17:23.489
Turn around.

17:29.929 --> 17:31.929
What, what, what's going on?

17:36.770 --> 17:38.770
Why are we turning round?

17:42.370 --> 17:44.370
I told you I'd figure it out.

17:45.290 --> 17:47.290
Gimme a fucking chance.

17:49.650 --> 17:52.130
(tense music)

18:18.810 --> 18:21.409
Oh, don't worry, your mum
and dad aren't dead yet.

18:23.050 --> 18:26.208
And your claim just now that
you could figure something out,

18:26.208 --> 18:28.650
was that just desperation too?

18:28.650 --> 18:31.249
No, I can do it.

18:31.249 --> 18:33.330
How?

18:33.850 --> 18:35.850
I can build a bomb inside.

18:38.969 --> 18:40.130
Out of what?

18:40.130 --> 18:41.090
Collected evidence.

18:41.090 --> 18:43.130
Explosives?

18:43.130 --> 18:44.249
From data analysis.

18:44.249 --> 18:47.969
They keep hold of tiny samples.

18:47.969 --> 18:51.090
Not enough on their own,
but put together, yeah.

18:51.090 --> 18:53.290
And they could do the same job?

18:53.290 --> 18:54.929
Enough to take out the home secretary

18:54.929 --> 18:57.090
and anyone within three feet.

19:03.130 --> 19:06.050
I will kill your parents if
you're messing with me, Lana.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.690
Alex did manage to leave
us with something useful.

19:22.610 --> 19:24.770
Access to all the main
building security cameras

19:24.770 --> 19:26.850
inside CTHQ.

19:27.770 --> 19:29.810
We'll be able to see you wherever you go.

19:33.370 --> 19:35.370
And put this in your ear.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.770
It's so I can talk to you.

19:51.130 --> 19:52.969
And you'll need to wear
this around your neck.

19:52.969 --> 19:55.610
It's the induction loop for the earpiece.

19:55.610 --> 19:58.208
You'll be able to hear me
anywhere inside 800 feet.

20:00.130 --> 20:02.370
But you can't hear me?

20:02.370 --> 20:04.449
No, one way.

20:05.130 --> 20:08.610
So if I tell you what to do, you do it.

20:09.969 --> 20:12.010
And wire this phone to the device

20:12.010 --> 20:14.290
so I remain in control of the bomb.

20:15.370 --> 20:16.290
You kidding me?

20:16.290 --> 20:17.810
You'll find a way to get it inside.

20:17.810 --> 20:19.090
What if someone else calls it?

20:19.090 --> 20:21.530
It's code protected,
same as the other one.

20:22.929 --> 20:25.090
What are you gonna do
with the device in the van?

20:26.170 --> 20:27.409
When emergency services turn up,

20:27.409 --> 20:30.330
we can park the van in the middle of them.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.449
Make a nice secondary.

20:32.449 --> 20:34.530
Fucking hell.

20:35.170 --> 20:37.170
Home is just a phone call away.

20:39.810 --> 20:41.810
Take it, Lana.

20:50.530 --> 20:53.090
We wanna see you inside
the building in one minute.

20:54.969 --> 20:57.969
(suspenseful music)

21:22.610 --> 21:25.130
(tense music)

21:37.770 --> 21:39.409
58 seconds.

21:39.409 --> 21:41.489
You do like to take it to the wire.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.570
Hi, Lana Washington, expo.

21:46.409 --> 21:47.170
I forgot my lanyard,

21:47.170 --> 21:50.530
but I'm here to see Dr.
Reeves in bomb data analysis?

21:50.530 --> 21:51.728
Is she expecting you?

21:51.728 --> 21:52.929
No.

21:52.929 --> 21:55.010
Got some evidence that needs a look at.

21:59.090 --> 22:01.728
Dr. Reeves, there's a Lana
Washington here for you.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.050
(detector beeps)
- Can you go through again,

22:14.050 --> 22:16.130
please?

22:16.449 --> 22:19.208
(detector beeps)

22:20.889 --> 22:25.170
Okay, arms up.

22:25.170 --> 22:28.130
It's probably all the
shrapnel in my body.

22:28.130 --> 22:30.208
Plenty of it.

22:33.050 --> 22:35.050
Okay, turn around for me.

22:44.290 --> 22:46.770
(tense music)

22:55.570 --> 22:57.010
Oh, wait for Dr. Reeves, please.

22:57.010 --> 22:59.090
Yeah, sure.

23:01.409 --> 23:04.489
(Lana clears throat)

23:04.489 --> 23:06.489
I can take it from here, thanks.

23:06.489 --> 23:08.570
Told you you'd find a way in.

23:10.889 --> 23:11.650
You all right, mate?

23:11.650 --> 23:13.728
Yeah, good.

23:14.249 --> 23:14.969
I've got these.

23:14.969 --> 23:17.050
I need to log them.

23:17.969 --> 23:19.170
Okay.

23:19.170 --> 23:21.249
Do you wanna bring 'em up then?

23:22.409 --> 23:23.249
Cheers.

23:23.249 --> 23:25.850
(tense music)

23:35.208 --> 23:37.969
(elevator beeps)

23:39.050 --> 23:41.050
Wash, what's going on?

23:42.969 --> 23:44.889
Do you trust me?

23:44.889 --> 23:46.969
Yeah, of course.

23:48.090 --> 23:50.090
I've got a favour I need to ask you.

23:52.850 --> 23:54.929
Bring up the lift camera.

23:54.929 --> 23:57.050
We haven't got it.

23:57.050 --> 23:58.770
Why not?

23:58.770 --> 24:01.090
They're installed by the manufacturer.

24:01.090 --> 24:03.170
It's not a live feed.

24:05.969 --> 24:08.050
I need your pass and the OME code.

24:09.249 --> 24:10.810
That's quite a favour.

24:10.810 --> 24:12.889
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
ask if I didn't need to.

24:21.810 --> 24:23.170
Okay, we've got you on the third floor.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.728
Look to the camera on your
right if you can hear me.

24:27.409 --> 24:28.370
Hello, Lana.

24:28.370 --> 24:30.449
Your mum and dad are counting on you.

24:43.929 --> 24:44.770
- Lana?
- Danny.

24:44.770 --> 24:46.330
- What are you doing here?
- Carry on as normal, okay?

24:46.330 --> 24:48.090
We're being watched.

24:48.090 --> 24:50.170
What?

24:50.489 --> 24:52.208
This gang that we're after,

24:52.208 --> 24:53.728
they're watching us through the cameras.

24:53.728 --> 24:55.810
Just keep doing what you're doing.

24:58.090 --> 25:00.010
What are you up to, Lana?

25:00.010 --> 25:02.090
I hope you're sticking to the plan.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.810
I need your help, Danny.

25:13.409 --> 25:14.810
Huh?

25:14.810 --> 25:16.489
Don't react, but this gang,

25:16.489 --> 25:19.449
they've, they've wired
my mum and dad's house

25:19.449 --> 25:22.330
and if I don't do what
they say, they might die.

25:25.409 --> 25:26.570
What do they want you to do?

25:26.570 --> 25:28.650
Lana.

25:30.170 --> 25:32.170
Pass me your snips.

25:32.810 --> 25:34.489
What?

25:34.489 --> 25:35.330
What the hell's going on here?

25:35.330 --> 25:36.770
Just pass me your snips, Danny.

25:36.770 --> 25:38.690
Don't make a thing of it.

25:38.690 --> 25:40.770
Please.

25:47.208 --> 25:49.130
Thanks.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.850
Get Alice, go to my mum and dad's,

25:50.850 --> 25:52.929
and don't do anything until Sonya calls.

25:56.249 --> 25:59.130
Alright, you've got the
tools, now let's build the bomb.

26:02.249 --> 26:04.728
(tense music)

26:22.889 --> 26:25.370
(door clanks)

26:29.208 --> 26:31.850
(drawers clank)

26:53.690 --> 26:56.170
(door beeps)

26:56.170 --> 26:58.728
(tense music)

27:29.010 --> 27:32.610
So, the room, this whole
thing's packed with explosives.

27:35.770 --> 27:40.770
No, what are you doing?

27:46.650 --> 27:49.130
(tools clank)

27:50.130 --> 27:52.170
I'm just going for a tiny little look.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.690
Don't be daft, you don't
know about explosives.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.770
I know about wiring.

27:57.170 --> 27:58.330
No.

27:58.330 --> 27:59.770
- It's all right.
- No.

27:59.770 --> 28:00.728
It's all right.

28:00.728 --> 28:05.810
No!
(head thunks)

28:07.290 --> 28:08.208
(laughs) Things aren't good
between your mum and dad,

28:08.208 --> 28:10.290
are they, Lana?

28:11.690 --> 28:12.850
No, sorry, you're absolutely right.

28:12.850 --> 28:14.929
It's none of my business.

28:20.770 --> 28:22.850
I'm not like you.

28:22.850 --> 28:24.929
I'm not ready just to give up.

28:29.290 --> 28:33.330
[Hope] Looks like our guest has arrived.

28:33.330 --> 28:35.889
(tense music)

28:40.330 --> 28:41.409
Thank you so much for coming.

28:41.409 --> 28:43.170
We really appreciate it.

28:43.170 --> 28:45.249
Right this way.

28:47.969 --> 28:50.969
(suspenseful music)

29:17.770 --> 29:21.610
(suspenseful music continues)

29:37.810 --> 29:39.690
Well done, Lana.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.770
Should have recruited you long ago.

29:47.889 --> 29:50.249
Washington.

29:50.249 --> 29:51.929
What the hell are you doing here?

29:51.929 --> 29:53.170
Sir, apologies.

29:53.170 --> 29:55.050
Sonya in bomb data analysis isn't able

29:55.050 --> 29:57.650
to attend the meeting, so
she's asked me to step in.

29:57.650 --> 29:58.770
What?

29:58.770 --> 29:59.929
You can't be serious.

29:59.929 --> 30:01.208
I'm the person most qualified

30:01.208 --> 30:04.489
to talk about the devices
used in this campaign so far.

30:04.489 --> 30:05.610
Well, no, I'm sorry.

30:05.610 --> 30:06.810
This is, this is unacceptable.

30:06.810 --> 30:10.570
Sir, I know we didn't leave
on the best terms yesterday.

30:10.570 --> 30:12.489
You called me a brown-nosing twat.

30:12.489 --> 30:14.929
I know, sir, and I'm sorry, genuinely,

30:14.929 --> 30:17.250
but the home secretary
might want expert input

30:17.250 --> 30:18.490
on the devices.

30:18.490 --> 30:22.050
Alright, we'll park this for now.

30:22.050 --> 30:24.129
Stay and fill in for Dr. Reeves.

30:26.210 --> 30:28.210
It's appreciated.

30:33.408 --> 30:34.609
Thank you so much for coming.

30:34.609 --> 30:35.609
Thank you, a pleasure.

30:35.609 --> 30:37.850
We'll start imminently,
so please do take a seat.

30:37.850 --> 30:39.210
[Home Secretary] Right.

30:39.210 --> 30:40.050
Thank you very much, everyone.

30:40.050 --> 30:42.129
Please sit down.

30:48.730 --> 30:51.730
(suspenseful music)

30:58.330 --> 30:59.089
Yeah.

30:59.089 --> 31:00.850
- Thank you.
- No problem.

31:00.850 --> 31:02.928
Hi, thank you.

31:04.649 --> 31:06.010
Good afternoon, Home Secretary,

31:06.010 --> 31:08.609
and thank you for giving
us a moment of your time.

31:08.609 --> 31:11.770
This situation is dynamic
and moving at pace.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.408
Therefore, we will be brief.

31:13.408 --> 31:14.210
Thank you.

31:14.210 --> 31:16.089
And thanks to all those present

31:16.089 --> 31:17.370
for the work you've been doing

31:17.370 --> 31:20.530
in the most trying circumstances.

31:20.530 --> 31:21.810
Please continue, John.

31:21.810 --> 31:23.649
Thank you, ma'am.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.730
What's the plan, Lana?

31:26.370 --> 31:28.250
Does he take it to her
or she going to him?

31:28.250 --> 31:30.689
We will speak by exception only.

31:30.689 --> 31:33.449
The purpose of this brief
is to lay out the progress

31:33.449 --> 31:35.169
of this investigation.

31:35.169 --> 31:37.449
Looking at the group behind the attacks

31:37.449 --> 31:40.649
and the evidence we have
as to their identity,

31:40.649 --> 31:42.089
including the physical evidence,

31:42.089 --> 31:45.490
which we believe will lead
us to a swift resolution

31:45.490 --> 31:47.250
without further loss of life.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.927
We are dealing with a
group not previously known

31:49.927 --> 31:52.890
to the police or the security services.

31:52.890 --> 31:55.408
Their bombing campaign has targeted

31:57.970 --> 32:00.770
both in and around the city of London,

32:00.770 --> 32:03.449
using a level of
sophistication not seen before

32:03.449 --> 32:04.689
on the UK mainland.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.770
What kind of sophistication?

32:07.370 --> 32:09.408
Well, I have here a few examples

32:09.408 --> 32:13.010
of the improvised explosive
devices they have employed.

32:13.970 --> 32:16.570
We have been in
communication with Interpol

32:16.570 --> 32:19.210
and Five Eyes, who likewise
have not seen this type

32:19.210 --> 32:22.050
of ingenuity associated
with domestic terrorism

32:22.050 --> 32:24.449
and certainly not on this scale.

32:25.530 --> 32:28.290
I'd like to ask our explosives officer,

32:28.290 --> 32:30.370
Lana Washington, to join me.

32:31.649 --> 32:34.290
Lana is the lead technical
expert in this case,

32:34.290 --> 32:38.810
in the absence of Dr. Sonya
Reeves from bomb data analysis.

32:39.927 --> 32:42.089
She has particular expertise

32:42.089 --> 32:44.927
(message chimes)

32:48.408 --> 32:52.850
in defusing bombs and can
offer specialist insight

32:52.850 --> 32:55.290
into the likely identity
of the group responsible

32:55.290 --> 32:56.330
for the disa...

32:56.330 --> 32:59.169
(messages chime)

33:02.089 --> 33:05.530
Experience tells us that
improvised explosive devices

33:12.210 --> 33:12.970
(message chimes)

33:12.970 --> 33:15.850
have an identity that is very
particular to their maker.

33:25.850 --> 33:27.850
I'm sorry.

33:30.850 --> 33:32.890
Oh, I've had worse off your mother.

33:36.010 --> 33:39.687
I'm just, just can't stop grieving.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.208
Ah.

33:45.208 --> 33:46.649
Neither can I.

33:46.649 --> 33:50.249
It's funny, how long we've been married,

33:51.490 --> 33:55.647
we've got such different
ways of dealing with stuff.

33:57.647 --> 34:00.688
Well, I bottle things up, I think.

34:02.969 --> 34:05.089
I push things down.

34:06.409 --> 34:08.410
Keep myself busy.

34:09.889 --> 34:11.889
Kind of person I am.

34:16.290 --> 34:18.450
I'm not.

34:18.450 --> 34:20.608
You can say that again.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.129
Jeff.

34:27.129 --> 34:29.490
I don't blame you for Billy.

34:32.169 --> 34:34.169
It's not your fault.

34:36.767 --> 34:38.767
No.

34:39.849 --> 34:42.450
But it's not your fault either.

34:45.608 --> 34:47.410
(Val cries)

34:47.410 --> 34:49.169
Hey, hey.

34:49.169 --> 34:51.169
Val.

34:51.169 --> 34:53.129
Listen, it's gonna be all right.

34:53.129 --> 34:55.209
It's gonna be okay.

34:58.608 --> 35:01.129
(tense music)

35:22.809 --> 35:23.608
[Hope] What's the plan, Lana?

35:23.608 --> 35:25.889
The first device Lana
is going to show you-

35:25.889 --> 35:27.169
With all due respect, John,

35:27.169 --> 35:30.169
I'm not interested in the
type of bombs being used.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.129
I want to know how you're going

35:31.129 --> 35:33.290
to catch the terrorists behind this.

35:34.330 --> 35:35.969
I understand that, Home Secretary,

35:35.969 --> 35:38.648
but the nature of the devices used-

35:38.648 --> 35:41.129
Is sophisticated, I get that.

35:41.129 --> 35:42.889
But what measures are actually being taken

35:42.889 --> 35:44.929
to hunt down the perpetrators?
- Lana.

35:44.929 --> 35:46.169
Of course.

35:46.169 --> 35:48.688
If we examine the granular intelligence.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.809
Forgive me, ma'am.

35:50.809 --> 35:54.688
Sorry, but I, I agree
with Commander Francis.

35:54.688 --> 35:56.849
An understanding of the
device is the only way

35:56.849 --> 35:58.929
to establish who's behind it.

36:01.728 --> 36:04.849
This is a command initiated device.

36:09.290 --> 36:12.688
A bomb like this would allow
the bomber greater control

36:12.688 --> 36:15.767
to hit their planned target.

36:19.767 --> 36:21.849
(messages chime)

36:21.849 --> 36:24.569
What's unusual about this is

36:24.569 --> 36:26.569
it's not triggered just
by calling the phone.

36:26.569 --> 36:29.929
You have to enter a four
digit code to set it off.

36:30.767 --> 36:33.290
This is bomb making of the highest order,

36:33.290 --> 36:35.089
so an understanding of how it's made is-

36:35.089 --> 36:37.370
Yes, exactly, thank you very much, Lana.

36:40.450 --> 36:41.490
Do it, now.

36:41.490 --> 36:44.249
No, it's not close enough.

36:44.249 --> 36:45.129
You're all clear.

36:45.129 --> 36:47.008
Take positions.

36:47.008 --> 36:49.648
(phone chimes)

36:53.569 --> 36:55.767
DS Morgan.

36:55.767 --> 36:56.889
Do we have everyone out?

36:56.889 --> 36:58.290
Just those attending the briefing

36:58.290 --> 37:00.209
and those in close proximity left.

37:00.209 --> 37:02.370
Okay, have we been cleared to proceed?

37:02.370 --> 37:05.490
We are authorised to use
lethal force if required.

37:06.767 --> 37:09.767
(suspenseful music)

37:14.290 --> 37:17.330
And of course, this device
is only one of a variety

37:17.330 --> 37:19.410
of initiation methods used.

37:20.569 --> 37:22.767
You can clearly see the complexities

37:22.767 --> 37:25.169
that we as a team have faced

37:25.169 --> 37:28.129
in the course of our investigation.

37:28.129 --> 37:30.209
Armed police are in the building.

37:32.648 --> 37:34.648
Closing in.

37:37.490 --> 37:38.889
You're gonna have to make a move, Lana.

37:38.889 --> 37:40.969
It's you or your mum and dad.

37:45.048 --> 37:48.169
And variety indicates
either a bomb making team

37:48.169 --> 37:51.608
or a very talented individual bomb maker.

37:51.608 --> 37:52.969
As individuals tend to stick

37:52.969 --> 37:56.809
to the type of device they
have the most success with.

37:56.809 --> 38:01.290
So whoever it is is a
clean skin, someone new.

38:01.290 --> 38:04.249
So while we have hundreds of
personnel working this case,

38:04.249 --> 38:07.569
it's true we have very
few actionable leads.

38:09.648 --> 38:10.410
[Hope] Now, Lana.

38:10.410 --> 38:14.008
But indication suggests
that another attack is...

38:16.688 --> 38:18.688
Now.

38:20.450 --> 38:22.450
Ma'am!

38:23.529 --> 38:26.809
(Home Secretary gasps)

38:27.728 --> 38:28.450
(phone rings)

38:28.450 --> 38:30.290
[Recording] This call
is being redirected.

38:30.290 --> 38:32.410
(phone rings)

38:32.410 --> 38:34.490
What?

38:35.490 --> 38:36.330
Shit!

38:36.330 --> 38:39.249
(explosion booms)

38:41.129 --> 38:43.129
Armed police, stop!

38:43.728 --> 38:45.330
Stay there!

38:45.330 --> 38:47.290
Stay still.

38:47.290 --> 38:48.889
Keep your hands where we can see them.

38:48.889 --> 38:50.688
Move forward.

38:50.688 --> 38:51.529
Stop.

38:51.529 --> 38:53.249
Batra, will you call Sonya, please?

38:53.249 --> 38:54.929
- Sure, yeah.
- Move forward.

38:54.929 --> 38:56.767
Stop.

38:56.767 --> 38:58.330
IED, IED.

38:58.330 --> 38:59.849
Stand back!

38:59.849 --> 39:03.809
Everyone follow (indistinct)
to your nearest exit.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.889
All right, CTHQ.

39:06.929 --> 39:08.929
That's it, house go.

39:12.089 --> 39:14.969
Okay, now, very, very
gently catch this, sir.

39:14.969 --> 39:16.809
You got it?
- Got it.

39:16.809 --> 39:18.889
You guys all right?

39:19.330 --> 39:20.889
[Jeff] Come on, Val, come on.

39:20.889 --> 39:22.969
There we go, there we go, lovely.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.169
Nice and gently, gently, gently, gently.

39:25.169 --> 39:26.849
You got her?
- Yeah.

39:26.849 --> 39:27.929
Nice and gently, please.

39:27.929 --> 39:28.728
Well done, Val, well done, well done.

39:28.728 --> 39:29.569
Easy, easy, it's okay, I've got you.

39:29.569 --> 39:30.410
You good?

39:30.410 --> 39:31.410
Here we go, we got it.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.249
Easy as pie, here we go.

39:33.249 --> 39:34.648
- All right, guys, let's go.
- Bye.

39:34.648 --> 39:35.849
[Speaker] You wanna get that
door for me, mate, please?

39:35.849 --> 39:37.929
Tell Wash her parents are safe.

39:39.569 --> 39:42.688
You diverted the call
from the phone they gave you

39:42.688 --> 39:44.809
and it gave you command of the device?

39:44.809 --> 39:46.889
Yeah.

39:48.648 --> 39:50.648
That's clever.

39:51.290 --> 39:53.849
But why then did the bomb
you built get all the way

39:53.849 --> 39:54.929
to the home secretary?

39:54.929 --> 39:57.929
Because I needed them to think
it was them setting it off.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.849
The real device required a four digit code

39:59.849 --> 40:01.169
that only they had access to.

40:01.169 --> 40:02.608
Why didn't you alert our officers

40:02.608 --> 40:04.169
as soon as you entered the building?

40:04.169 --> 40:05.889
Because they would've
killed my mum and dad.

40:05.889 --> 40:08.048
But you could have
killed the home secretary.

40:08.048 --> 40:10.529
I was trying to take
control of the situation.

40:10.529 --> 40:12.169
Control?

40:12.169 --> 40:13.008
Lana-
- And-

40:13.008 --> 40:14.290
[John] You took a hell of a risk.

40:14.290 --> 40:18.767
In doing that, she saved
other people's lives.

40:20.529 --> 40:22.688
I think we'd do well
to remember that, sir.

40:28.648 --> 40:30.688
What about the others?

40:30.688 --> 40:32.767
I gave you their location.

40:34.089 --> 40:38.728
What?

40:41.249 --> 40:42.889
Armed police, get down!

40:42.889 --> 40:45.290
(police shouting)

40:45.290 --> 40:47.370
Don't move, don't move!

40:49.450 --> 40:52.048
(solemn music)

41:17.728 --> 41:20.290
(upbeat music)

41:20.290 --> 41:21.129
There you are.

41:21.129 --> 41:22.767
Been looking for you.

41:22.767 --> 41:24.849
You been hiding in the loo?

41:25.728 --> 41:26.490
You all right?

41:26.490 --> 41:27.728
No, I'm not.

41:27.728 --> 41:29.809
Look, do you want to go?

41:29.809 --> 41:30.929
I'm happy to cover for you.

41:30.929 --> 41:32.370
No, I can't go, it's Danny's wedding.

41:32.370 --> 41:34.370
I'm just gonna get shit-faced.

41:34.370 --> 41:36.290
Well, that sounds like a good idea.

41:36.290 --> 41:38.929
(guests cheer)

41:49.089 --> 41:50.648
Oh, thank you.

41:50.648 --> 41:52.728
[All] Cheers.

41:56.648 --> 41:59.290
Who are you looking at?

41:59.290 --> 42:01.370
I think he's one of Danny's uncles.

42:01.969 --> 42:03.490
He's checking you out.

42:03.490 --> 42:05.569
Yeah, look at them eyes.

42:06.008 --> 42:06.767
Go and say hello then.

42:06.767 --> 42:08.129
No, I'm not gonna leave you.

42:08.129 --> 42:10.370
Oh, sod off and go and say hello.

42:10.370 --> 42:11.209
He's hot.

42:11.209 --> 42:13.290
I'm gonna drag you there if you don't go.

42:13.290 --> 42:15.370
All right, all right.

42:16.249 --> 42:17.809
Go on, go on.

42:17.809 --> 42:20.249
That'll be the last you see of her today.

42:20.249 --> 42:23.008
Uh huh, yep.

42:23.008 --> 42:26.089
Oh, here he is, man of the moment.

42:27.048 --> 42:28.450
Come here.

42:28.450 --> 42:30.490
It was nothing, it was nothing.

42:30.490 --> 42:32.008
Oh, he's a very modest man, isn't he?

42:32.008 --> 42:34.290
You and Danny only saved our lives.

42:34.290 --> 42:36.169
And listen, Lana, she did all the work.

42:36.169 --> 42:39.370
Yeah, I'm gonna take the
credit 'cause I'm his boss.

42:39.370 --> 42:40.330
Oh, this is unsettling.

42:40.330 --> 42:42.410
I'm gonna go, bye.

42:44.529 --> 42:46.370
You scrubbed up well, Dad.

42:46.370 --> 42:47.929
Yeah, looking great, love, yeah?

42:47.929 --> 42:49.929
Yeah, you all right?

42:49.929 --> 42:52.089
Yeah, tip top, tip top.

42:53.048 --> 42:55.849
Oh no, how's Mum doing?

42:55.849 --> 42:56.767
Look at her.

42:56.767 --> 42:57.608
She's fine.

42:57.608 --> 42:58.929
Nice to see her out.

42:58.929 --> 42:59.767
Yeah.

42:59.767 --> 43:01.529
Mind you, if she gets on the dance floor,

43:01.529 --> 43:04.529
you'll have to help me restrain
her before there's carnage.

43:04.529 --> 43:07.048
- Hi, you all right?
- All right, love?

43:07.048 --> 43:09.410
Her outfit looks even cooler than mine.

43:09.410 --> 43:12.008
(Jeff laughs)

43:14.410 --> 43:16.410
Billy would've liked this.

43:16.728 --> 43:18.209
No, he wouldn't, he hated parties.

43:18.209 --> 43:20.290
He had two left feet, couldn't dance.

43:23.569 --> 43:25.889
(laughs) Yeah, true enough.

43:27.969 --> 43:30.569
(upbeat music)

43:33.089 --> 43:35.089
You okay?

43:35.410 --> 43:37.410
Yeah.

43:39.290 --> 43:40.209
[Danny] All right.

43:40.209 --> 43:41.648
No, Danny, listen,
I'm, I'm happy for you,

43:41.648 --> 43:43.008
but this is where I draw the line.

43:43.008 --> 43:44.330
- Not taking no for an answer.
- Right, Sonya.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.569
Let's go, let's go.

43:46.569 --> 43:48.209
I'm after you, come on.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.889
(guests cheer)

43:57.330 --> 43:59.330
- Thank you.
- Fair.

44:00.048 --> 44:02.648
(upbeat music)

44:11.008 --> 44:13.608
(guests laugh)

44:23.969 --> 44:26.728
(dramatic music)

44:58.129 --> 45:00.330
(calm music)
