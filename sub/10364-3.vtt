33:13.440 --> 33:15.120
[in English] Where is this fucking party?

33:15.200 --> 33:17.920
- We're almost there.
- Stupid Norskies!

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
Why you just can't party
in urban centers, like rest of us?

33:22.080 --> 33:25.160
[Andrius in Lithuanian] Did you tell
the Pakistanis we were going out of town?

33:25.240 --> 33:26.840
[Giedra] Of course not.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.000
Maybe you should grow some balls, son.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.560
I could say the same to your fat brother.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.920
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.080
[car horn beeping]

33:41.160 --> 33:42.560
Move your...

33:44.320 --> 33:47.600
[in English] Farmer boy, we don't have
all day. Take off your stupid animals.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.840
[Torgeir] Don't worry. I'll round them up.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.400
Hurry up.

Help me with this guy, Torgeir.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.840
[in English] Remember me?

34:28.840 --> 34:33.600
Little advice: Next time you shoot
a good Samaritan, finish the job.

34:33.680 --> 34:34.920
[Giedra] What do you want?

34:35.000 --> 34:39.680
Well, I had the questionable honor
of the gift of one of your slugs.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.000
I intend to return the favor.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.760
Nobody shoots
an old crippled woman in cold blood.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.760
What kind of man are you?

34:48.840 --> 34:51.720
The kind that shoots
old crippled women in cold blood.

34:51.800 --> 34:55.240
After all, we are in the gender equality
capital of the world.

34:55.320 --> 34:58.560
And I'm turning
more Norwegian by the moment.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.760
[in Lithuanian] Oh, dear God!

35:02.000 --> 35:03.160
[in English] Time to go.

35:03.240 --> 35:06.960
No, please, sir. No. I'm too young, sir.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.200
Trust me, old age is overrated.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.520
- [knocking on door]
- [in Norwegian] You have to open up! Roy!

35:11.600 --> 35:14.160
[Torgeir] I thought you told your cousin
to stay away.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.280
- [in English] What? Get rid of him.
- [Roy] Two secs.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.960
[in Norwegian] Roy, let me in.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.480
We're in the middle
of some sensitive stuff here.

35:22.560 --> 35:26.400
But can't you hear that?
Betsy is about to lamb.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.520
- What?
- Betsy is about to lamb.

35:29.600 --> 35:33.360
[in English] We have a problem.
That sheep is about to give birth.

35:34.880 --> 35:36.400
[bleats]

35:37.600 --> 35:40.560
So invite me to the baptism.
Who gives a fuck?

35:40.640 --> 35:43.240
You don't understand.
Vegard fucking loves that sheep

35:43.320 --> 35:45.560
and will call the cops
if we don't handle this.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.440
Jesus Christ!

35:49.000 --> 35:50.840
I can deliver it.

35:50.920 --> 35:52.040
[Johnny] What?

35:52.120 --> 35:56.440
Yeah, I have a survival kit
with gloves and disinfectant in the car.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.480
So it's... I can do it.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.960
You have...

36:01.160 --> 36:02.880
- You do?
- Yeah.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.320
All right. Deliver the sheep.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.120
[lamb bleating]

36:17.040 --> 36:18.760
[Johnny] Unbelievable.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.280
You really did it, kid.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.560
[Torgeir] Yeah.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.840
It's a boy.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.000
It's a first for me.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.600
- Hello there, little lambsy.
- Hello.

36:32.680 --> 36:33.680
[Johnny chuckles]

36:33.760 --> 36:37.360
It's not such a bad world. You'll see.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.200
Over there.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.760
- Do it fast, okay?
- Shut up!

36:55.880 --> 36:58.040
After witnessing the miracle of birth,

36:58.120 --> 37:03.880
I find myself in an uncharacteristically
generous mood.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.760
This is how it's going to go.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.800
I'm putting you on the first bus
back to the Baltics.

37:10.880 --> 37:14.760
You will stay there
and you will fucking die there.

37:14.840 --> 37:18.520
'Cause you come back to Scandinavia
and I promise you, you will die here.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.480
So... we will live?

37:23.960 --> 37:25.640
Yeah. For now.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.880
[in Norwegian] Thank you, sir.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.040
Thank you.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.480
[Johnny in English]
Get these motherfuckers out of my sight.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.400
[Giedra in Lithuanian] Stop. You're worse
than a Norwegian metrosexual.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.760
[Andrius]
I thought they were going to shoot us.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.160
Will I ever stop being ashamed of you?

37:40.240 --> 37:43.800
- [in Norwegian] What's that thing?
- [Torgeir] A signal pistol.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.360
Unbelievably practical
if your car stalls...

37:54.160 --> 37:55.840
[Vitautas in English] Oh, my God!

37:55.920 --> 37:59.360
Torgeir!
What the fuck did you do?

38:00.600 --> 38:02.800
It was the hand injury.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.400
Oh, fuck!

38:06.800 --> 38:08.760
Guess we should take them out as well?

38:08.840 --> 38:11.760
[in Lithuanian] The Lord gives
and the Lord takes away! [laughs]

38:11.840 --> 38:14.280

about bus tickets, right?

[in Norwegian]
They're really going at it out there.

38:29.760 --> 38:33.640
It's some bio-waste
that I said they could get rid of.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.520
- They're about to start the glazing.
- I'm coming!

can befall one man.

Zip it! All we do is
bail you out of jail all the time.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.360

to take care of something for Johnny.

I just had a pretty stressful day
at work yesterday.

- [Birgitte] What?
- That's all.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.520
What happened?

41:05.600 --> 41:08.360
I can't go into detail
for confidentiality reasons,

41:08.440 --> 41:11.000
but it was pretty upsetting.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.440
I see.

41:14.440 --> 41:17.240
Shit. Is that from the arm wrestling?

Mind if I take a look?

[cries]

41:31.120 --> 41:32.720
What's wrong?

41:36.160 --> 41:38.440
It's just that
I'm not used to being cared for.

this place looks wonderful.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.360
Well... Think I overdid it a little bit?

It's absolutely fantastic.

I figured I'm not going to be elected
Father of the Year any time soon, so...

I want the kids to understand
how important they are to me.

Yeah. To be honest,
it's been a challenging week.
