00:09.388 --> 00:12.909
[mystical space-age music]

00:17.224 --> 00:19.502
[rumbling]

00:23.678 --> 00:26.336
[pensive music]

00:33.447 --> 00:36.070
- To thine own self be true.

00:38.555 --> 00:40.350
At least that's what
I used to think.

00:42.594 --> 00:45.183
Now I wonder if it isn't
something more insidious.

00:47.219 --> 00:49.532
Like a curse or a joke.

00:52.017 --> 00:54.951
Of all the different
people we are inside

00:57.022 --> 00:58.230
who are we to be true to?

01:08.206 --> 01:10.484
[knocking]

01:18.940 --> 01:21.598
Maybe they're not home.

01:21.633 --> 01:24.049
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.

01:26.051 --> 01:28.053
Temporary, remember.

01:29.123 --> 01:29.951
Temporary.

01:31.746 --> 01:32.954
- So how was your flight?

01:32.989 --> 01:35.405
Oh, I feel terrible
you had to fly coach.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.166
You should have said
something to me.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.237
We would have bought
you a better ticket.

01:39.271 --> 01:41.170
- Mom, coach is fine.

01:41.204 --> 01:42.930
- When's your
stuff getting here?

01:42.964 --> 01:43.758
- [Jessica] What stuff?

01:43.793 --> 01:44.932
- Your furniture.

01:44.966 --> 01:46.278
- I told you, Mom, we sold it.

01:46.313 --> 01:47.555
- What, why?

01:47.590 --> 01:49.143
- 'Cause they had to get
the hell out of Dodge.

01:49.178 --> 01:50.455
Am I right, Joel?

01:50.489 --> 01:51.559
[all chuckling]

01:51.594 --> 01:54.597
- I guess I still don't get it.

01:54.631 --> 01:59.188
I don't even know what
GTI stands, or, stood for.

01:59.222 --> 02:01.051
Joel, what happened, exactly?

02:01.086 --> 02:02.570
- You know what, Mom,
let's not discuss this.

02:02.605 --> 02:04.158
- It's all the papers
are talking about.

02:04.193 --> 02:07.334
- Guys, we just got here,
let's enjoy this amazing meal.

02:07.368 --> 02:08.887
- Alright, honey.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.684
But Joel, you wanna give us
your side of the story, right?

02:12.718 --> 02:15.100
Otherwise, we're gonna
think all the bad things

02:15.135 --> 02:16.481
they're saying
about you are true.

02:16.515 --> 02:17.585
- [Jessica] How
about some wine, Mom?

02:17.620 --> 02:18.448
- It's fine.

02:19.898 --> 02:20.726
Um...

02:23.867 --> 02:28.596
GTI, Genesis
Technology Integrated.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.669
My partner, Craig Vine,
developed a process

02:32.704 --> 02:34.257
that could catalyze water.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.467
No pollution, just steam.

02:38.710 --> 02:40.229
We were gonna save the world.

02:41.609 --> 02:43.749
Al I had to do was
raise the money.

02:43.784 --> 02:46.269
[tense music]

02:47.512 --> 02:48.892
- [Joel] 30 copies by
11 o'clock, please.

02:48.927 --> 02:50.480
- [Secretary] Sure, I'll
get started on that now.

02:50.515 --> 02:52.448
Oh, and your wife's on line two.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.417
- Hello, Mrs. Eastman-Green,

02:56.452 --> 02:58.385
are you ready for
this afternoon?

02:58.419 --> 02:59.593
- [Jessica] Oh, shit.

02:59.627 --> 03:01.111
Um, did I forget to tell you?
- What?

03:01.146 --> 03:02.354
[knocking]

03:02.389 --> 03:04.080
- [Jessica] The realtor
moved the closing to 11.

03:04.114 --> 03:05.530
Does that work?

03:05.564 --> 03:07.325
- Oh, babe, that's
when we're closing GTI.

03:07.359 --> 03:09.189
- [Jessica] Shit,
I'm sorry, I forgot.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.156
You know what, don't
worry about it.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.468
I can handle it.

03:12.502 --> 03:14.194
We'll celebrate tonight, though.

03:15.091 --> 03:15.988
- You know what?

03:16.023 --> 03:17.335
I'm gonna do both.

03:17.369 --> 03:19.095
I'm gonna run Sonny
through the agenda,

03:19.129 --> 03:20.924
let him get caught up to speed,

03:20.959 --> 03:22.063
he can take care of the rest.

03:22.098 --> 03:23.513
- [Jessica] Babe, are you sure?

03:23.548 --> 03:25.481
- [Joel] I'm gonna be late,
but I'm gonna be there.

03:25.515 --> 03:26.516
- [Jessica] Oh, that
is so great, okay!

03:26.551 --> 03:28.518
- See you in a bit.

03:28.553 --> 03:30.486
Sonny, I'm gonna need a favor.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.935
- Joel, we need to talk.

03:32.867 --> 03:35.594
[copier beeping]

03:47.054 --> 03:48.538
Joel, did you hear what I said?

03:49.988 --> 03:53.992
Craig faked his results, the
Board's withdrawn support.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.442
- I don't understand.

03:55.476 --> 03:57.547
- Now, I know how
much you put into GTI,

03:57.582 --> 03:59.446
both personally and
all your friends,

03:59.480 --> 04:00.516
but the Board's exposed here.

04:00.550 --> 04:03.657
This is a, it's a scandal.

04:03.691 --> 04:05.383
And Ventura needs
a firewall or a lot

04:05.417 --> 04:07.488
of people are gonna
lose a lot more.

04:07.523 --> 04:09.007
- What do you mean, firewall?

04:10.180 --> 04:12.355
- There's gonna be
a press release.

04:12.390 --> 04:15.289
You'll be named; cutting
corners, looking the other way.

04:15.324 --> 04:18.257
And, hey, one bad egg sounds a
lot better than bubble, okay?

04:18.291 --> 04:20.466
There's so much more at
stake here than just GTI.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.882
- I'll lose all
my relationships.

04:21.916 --> 04:23.124
No one's ever gonna
trust me again.

04:23.159 --> 04:24.540
- You'll bounce back.

04:24.574 --> 04:25.817
- Bounce back?

04:25.851 --> 04:26.749
I don't have time to
bounce back, Sonny!

04:26.783 --> 04:27.991
I'm buying a house in an hour!

04:28.026 --> 04:29.752
What am I supposed
to tell my wife?

04:30.994 --> 04:32.858
- I need you out of
here by the weekend.

04:32.893 --> 04:35.205
- Wait, Craig's still in
town, let me talk to Craig.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.000
- Dude, it's over!

04:37.035 --> 04:38.968
- No, it's not, gimme a day!

04:39.002 --> 04:41.729
An hour, gimme one hour
to figure something out.

04:41.764 --> 04:43.593
- Fine, you save GTI by lunch

04:43.628 --> 04:45.215
I'll take it back to the Board.

04:48.874 --> 04:51.152
[knocking]

04:52.499 --> 04:54.742
[tense music]

04:54.777 --> 04:56.054
- Let me in, Craig.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.711
- You don't wanna
come in here, man.

04:57.745 --> 04:59.678
- How do we save GTI?

04:59.713 --> 05:01.784
- We don't, it's over, Joel.

05:02.647 --> 05:03.855
- No, it's not!

05:03.889 --> 05:05.443
I'm gonna lose everything.

05:05.477 --> 05:06.789
What did you fake?

05:06.823 --> 05:09.964
Did your process ever even work?

05:11.138 --> 05:13.865
- Look, early on I
had a partner, okay.

05:13.899 --> 05:16.557
He didn't exactly do
things above board.

05:16.592 --> 05:17.800
As long as he was
cutting me checks

05:17.834 --> 05:19.077
I needed to show results.

05:19.111 --> 05:22.114
The whole thing just
kind of snowballed.

05:22.149 --> 05:24.738
I knew if I got Ventura involved

05:24.772 --> 05:26.740
I could buy enough
time to figure

05:26.774 --> 05:29.467
out how to make
the process work.

05:31.158 --> 05:32.470
- Help me save GTI.

05:32.504 --> 05:34.575
- Bro, you're not
hearing me, it's dead.

05:34.610 --> 05:35.818
- That's unacceptable.

05:35.852 --> 05:37.371
I don't care if you have
to fake more numbers,

05:37.406 --> 05:38.579
I'm gonna lose my house!

05:38.614 --> 05:39.787
Do you understand?

05:39.822 --> 05:41.099
Ventura is pinning
the whole thing on me!

05:41.133 --> 05:42.859
- I worked on this
thing for 12 years,

05:42.894 --> 05:44.309
Joel, you've been on it for two.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.415
My old partner,
that guy's probably

05:46.449 --> 05:47.692
looking for me right now.

05:47.726 --> 05:49.487
My wife is suing me.

05:49.521 --> 05:50.729
I'm outta here in two hours.

05:50.764 --> 05:52.075
I don't know where
I'm sleeping tonight,

05:52.110 --> 05:55.147
so I'm sorry that you
lost your reputation!

06:00.463 --> 06:05.468
Word of advice, Joel; don't
believe everything you see.

06:09.783 --> 06:12.958
- When I told Jessica
I lost our savings,

06:12.993 --> 06:15.547
our home, and was responsible

06:15.582 --> 06:17.687
for a 90 million
dollar screw-up,

06:19.137 --> 06:21.173
she said we ought
to come back East.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.554
- It's all gonna blow over.

06:23.486 --> 06:24.729
He's gonna find something else.

06:24.763 --> 06:27.076
- The goddamn media
blows everything up.

06:27.110 --> 06:29.043
- They said you
took people's money.

06:29.078 --> 06:31.598
That's ridiculous,
you lost everything!

06:31.632 --> 06:32.461
- Thank you.

06:33.910 --> 06:36.396
So, what's everybody
else been up to?

06:37.707 --> 06:39.122
- I got an audition already.

06:39.157 --> 06:39.951
- Really, honey?

06:39.985 --> 06:41.021
Well, that's great!

06:41.055 --> 06:42.263
- Yeah, it is.

06:42.298 --> 06:43.713
I think that I'm gonna
do really well here.

06:43.748 --> 06:46.198
The theater scene is big, so,
you know, fingers crossed.

06:46.233 --> 06:47.959
- I love seeing her onstage.

06:47.993 --> 06:51.514
- I can't wait, but it's
gonna take a lot more

06:51.549 --> 06:53.827
than acting to get you
two back on your feet.

06:53.861 --> 06:55.587
- She's right, Joel.

06:55.622 --> 06:57.796
Tomorrow you and I
should hit the links.

06:57.831 --> 06:59.039
I might know a couple of guys

06:59.073 --> 07:00.799
that could use a
financial advisor.

07:01.766 --> 07:02.974
We could talk about it.

07:03.008 --> 07:05.183
- Thanks, Ward, but
I'm pretty tired.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.943
- Come on, fresh
air'll do you good!

07:06.978 --> 07:08.220
- That's okay.

07:08.255 --> 07:09.636
- Yeah, we're still on
West coast time, Dad.

07:09.670 --> 07:12.708
- So, push through it,
that's how you beat jet lag.

07:12.742 --> 07:15.918
Trust me, Joel, we'll warm
up on the driving range,

07:15.952 --> 07:17.954
we'll go for $20 bucks a hole.

07:17.989 --> 07:20.336
You might even make some money!

07:20.370 --> 07:22.131
- Maybe this weekend, huh?

07:22.165 --> 07:23.926
I'm pretty tired, probably
just gonna sleep in.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.445
- Am I missing something here?

07:26.653 --> 07:29.207
You lose everything,
you run out of town

07:29.241 --> 07:30.829
and you wanna sleep in?
- Dad!

07:30.864 --> 07:32.210
- I'm serious.

07:32.244 --> 07:35.351
I know what it is to be
depressed, I was a cop.

07:35.385 --> 07:37.629
And you gotta be proactive.

07:37.664 --> 07:39.182
You gotta get out of your head.

07:39.217 --> 07:40.598
- I'm not depressed, Ward.

07:40.632 --> 07:42.151
- You don't know what you are.

07:43.359 --> 07:44.567
I'm gonna call and
set up a tee time

07:44.602 --> 07:46.120
for 7:30 tomorrow and you will

07:46.155 --> 07:47.881
thank me when we're out there.

07:47.915 --> 07:50.608
- How do you even afford
club dues on a cop's pension?

07:51.574 --> 07:53.300
- Pension, nothing.

07:53.334 --> 07:56.096
We got a million and
change in mutual funds.

07:56.130 --> 07:57.615
Don't worry how I pay my dues.

07:57.649 --> 07:59.271
- Okay, could everybody
just please relax?

07:59.306 --> 08:00.514
- We just don't want you two

08:00.549 --> 08:02.723
to run out of time to have kids.

08:03.897 --> 08:04.794
- Kids?

08:04.829 --> 08:06.037
Mom, that's our business.

08:06.071 --> 08:07.521
- But you gotta
lay the groundwork

08:07.556 --> 08:10.628
and you gotta be aggressive
and you can't sleep in.

08:10.662 --> 08:11.560
- Right.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.113
- Tell them about the house.

08:13.147 --> 08:15.529
- There's a very nice house
for sale across the street.

08:15.564 --> 08:17.013
Very modestly priced.

08:17.048 --> 08:19.326
- And we could help you guys
out with a down payment.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.190
- It'd be even easier
with grandchildren

08:21.224 --> 08:22.502
somewhere on the horizon.

08:22.536 --> 08:23.917
- [Ward] That's
all we're saying.

08:23.951 --> 08:25.643
- That's all we're saying!

08:25.677 --> 08:27.161
Just think about it.

08:33.582 --> 08:34.928
So, what do you think?

08:36.376 --> 08:39.173
- Thank you both, very
much, but we really

08:39.207 --> 08:41.486
don't need all this
extra pressure right now.

08:42.693 --> 08:43.730
- You're right, Joel.

08:43.764 --> 08:45.594
This is too much pressure.

08:45.628 --> 08:46.767
We need to relax.

08:47.734 --> 08:49.218
- Thank you.

08:49.252 --> 08:51.945
- Tomorrow morning, bright and
early we can get up and we--

08:51.979 --> 08:54.913
- I'm not golfing
tomorrow, Ward!

08:54.948 --> 08:55.811
- [Jessica] Calm down.

08:55.845 --> 08:56.743
- Me, calm down?

08:56.777 --> 08:58.330
- Just, why don't you just golf?

08:58.365 --> 09:02.852
- It's fine.

09:02.887 --> 09:05.475
- You know what, maybe
I am a little wound up.

09:05.510 --> 09:06.856
[laughs]

09:06.891 --> 09:08.099
I'm gonna go for a walk.

09:09.169 --> 09:10.170
Thanks for dinner.

09:13.863 --> 09:16.866
[soft, tense music]

09:39.509 --> 09:40.338
- Joel?

09:42.098 --> 09:42.927
It is you.

09:43.755 --> 09:44.791
- Veazy.

09:44.825 --> 09:45.861
- How you been, Joel?

09:45.895 --> 09:47.069
I didn't know you were in town.

09:47.103 --> 09:48.622
- Sleazy Veazy.

09:48.657 --> 09:50.279
You still slingin' apps?

09:50.313 --> 09:51.867
- No one calls me that anymore.

09:52.902 --> 09:53.696
- Sorry.

09:54.766 --> 09:56.181
How you been, man?

09:56.216 --> 09:57.527
- Amazing.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.978
GTI, huh?

10:02.015 --> 10:02.947
You okay, buddy?

10:04.707 --> 10:08.780
- Well, everyone I know hates
me and I live with my in-laws.

10:08.815 --> 10:10.713
Other than that,
yeah, pretty good.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.715
- You moved here?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.444
You know what, good for you.

10:17.478 --> 10:18.859
Fuck Silicon Valley!

10:18.894 --> 10:20.343
Perfect's not good
enough out there.

10:20.378 --> 10:22.242
You know, back here
people understand.

10:22.276 --> 10:24.313
You go up, you go down, but in
the long run we're all dead.

10:24.347 --> 10:25.728
So, who gives a fuck, right?

10:28.248 --> 10:29.076
- Thanks.

10:30.319 --> 10:32.010
Let me buy you a drink.

10:32.045 --> 10:33.218
- Joel, let me ask
you a question.

10:34.185 --> 10:36.394
If you had the inside track on

10:36.428 --> 10:38.672
the next big thing
how much do you think

10:38.707 --> 10:40.743
you could scrape
together, hypothetically?

10:40.778 --> 10:41.606
- Nothing.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.989
Everybody I know
got burned on GTI.

10:45.023 --> 10:45.817
Why?

10:47.025 --> 10:49.234
- Me and a friend of
mine, an engineer,

10:49.269 --> 10:52.513
we started something that
we think is pretty unique.

10:52.548 --> 10:53.791
Right now we're just
trying to close the gap

10:53.825 --> 10:55.585
on product testing
before we go live.

10:58.002 --> 10:59.589
- What do you make?

10:59.624 --> 11:03.455
- It's a service, actually,
we sell virtual experiences.

11:04.871 --> 11:06.596
- That's great, Nick, I'm
glad you're doing well.

11:06.631 --> 11:09.738
But, uh, right now I have
no access to capital.

11:10.911 --> 11:12.292
- [Nicolaus] None?

11:12.326 --> 11:15.053
- Until I can rebuild
a stable of investors.

11:15.088 --> 11:16.123
I need a day job.

11:16.158 --> 11:17.677
- Damn.
- Yeah.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.507
- All we're looking for
is a million and change.

11:20.541 --> 11:22.095
We're not just offering
this to just anybody.

11:22.129 --> 11:24.718
I want to work with
someone I know.

11:24.753 --> 11:25.926
- Why just a million?

11:25.961 --> 11:28.308
Isn't VR supposed
to be big boys only?

11:28.342 --> 11:32.553
- Yeah, well, we're small,
but our tech is revolutionary.

11:33.727 --> 11:37.697
It's called XVR and it's realer

11:37.731 --> 11:39.422
than anything
anybody's ever seen.

11:40.354 --> 11:42.046
- That's what everybody says.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.185
[Nicolaus laughs]

11:43.219 --> 11:45.394
- You don't
understand, XVR feels

11:45.428 --> 11:47.154
and looks as real
as this conversation

11:47.189 --> 11:48.880
we're having right
here, right now.

11:50.157 --> 11:50.986
Taste, too.

11:52.332 --> 11:54.127
Smell, touch.

11:54.161 --> 11:55.991
See Lester, the
engineer, he's a genius.

11:56.025 --> 11:57.406
And that's just the tech part,

11:57.440 --> 11:59.201
most people are more
intrigued by our applications.

11:59.235 --> 12:00.409
- What's that?

12:00.443 --> 12:02.238
- We allow high-end
clientele to experience

12:02.273 --> 12:04.482
what it's like to
be underprivileged.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.345
- Empathy.

12:06.795 --> 12:08.935
Why would anyone want
to feel underprivileged,

12:08.969 --> 12:09.901
don't people want to feel rich?

12:09.936 --> 12:11.109
- No, people want to be rich.

12:11.144 --> 12:13.284
What they want to feel
like is different.

12:13.318 --> 12:15.010
Think of the most
successful people you know.

12:15.044 --> 12:16.459
Are they happy?

12:16.494 --> 12:18.668
- I don't know anyone
that's happy, rich or poor.

12:18.703 --> 12:19.808
- Fine, fair enough.

12:19.842 --> 12:21.775
The point is,
people are miserable

12:21.810 --> 12:24.778
because they forget
what they have.

12:24.813 --> 12:27.781
Me and Lester help
them remember.

12:27.816 --> 12:28.955
- How?

12:28.989 --> 12:29.852
- Perspective.

12:31.371 --> 12:32.821
You know when you're
having a bad day

12:32.855 --> 12:35.547
and you think your life sucks?

12:35.582 --> 12:36.859
And then you just found out your

12:36.894 --> 12:39.966
neighbor's son just
killed himself.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.453
And then you think, damn, my
day wasn't that bad after all.

12:44.487 --> 12:46.973
In fact, I had a great day.

12:47.007 --> 12:48.491
That's the service we provide.

12:49.389 --> 12:50.666
You ever read the Bible?

12:50.700 --> 12:52.150
- No.

12:52.185 --> 12:54.049
- Yeah, me neither, but
there's a verse I memorized.

12:54.083 --> 12:58.191
There is one who pretends
to be rich and has nothing,

12:58.225 --> 13:01.711
another pretends to be poor
and has great wealth, Proverbs.

13:03.368 --> 13:04.784
- It's a good slogan.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.440
- It's the truth.

13:06.475 --> 13:08.339
Walk a mile in the shoes
of the less fortunate

13:08.373 --> 13:10.134
and when you wake up,
no matter what problems

13:10.168 --> 13:13.309
you have in your real life,
feel that much better.

13:15.518 --> 13:16.519
- There probably is
a pretty big market

13:16.554 --> 13:18.314
for something like that.

13:18.349 --> 13:19.660
[cell phone buzzing]
- Oh, sorry.

13:24.113 --> 13:25.735
Now, this is gonna
take a minute.

13:27.116 --> 13:28.428
I'll see you around, okay?

13:30.154 --> 13:32.294
Yeah, I'm in a bar, hold up.
- Hey, Nicolaus, wait up.

13:32.328 --> 13:33.813
- Yeah?

13:33.847 --> 13:35.780
- I, uh, I actually might know

13:35.815 --> 13:37.333
a couple people who could help.

13:38.369 --> 13:40.267
A retired couple
with a nest egg.

13:40.302 --> 13:41.855
I could test the waters.

13:43.339 --> 13:44.996
- [Nicolaus] Call
me anytime, Joel.

13:52.245 --> 13:53.246
- Hey.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.109
- [Jessica] Hey.

13:54.143 --> 13:54.937
- They asleep?

13:54.972 --> 13:56.525
- Yeah, where'd you go?

13:57.526 --> 13:58.976
- Some bar.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.494
- I would have gone with you.

14:00.529 --> 14:02.048
- I know, sorry.

14:02.082 --> 14:04.222
I shouldn't have left like that.

14:04.257 --> 14:06.397
- There were out of line, too.

14:06.431 --> 14:08.295
But they're not wrong, we
need some sort of plan,

14:08.330 --> 14:10.608
otherwise they're
gonna drive us crazy.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.748
- Actually, I
might have an idea.

14:13.956 --> 14:15.130
- [Jessica] Yeah?

14:15.164 --> 14:16.579
- I ran into an
old friend tonight.

14:16.614 --> 14:19.582
He has this virtual
reality start-up.

14:19.617 --> 14:21.791
It actually kind of
sounds interesting.

14:21.826 --> 14:23.586
I haven't seen the tech
yet, but if it checks out,

14:23.621 --> 14:25.795
I might help out with financing.

14:25.830 --> 14:27.452
- I thought GTI ruined all that?

14:27.487 --> 14:29.006
- I thought it did, too.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.904
But, all I'd have to
do is raise a million,

14:30.939 --> 14:33.907
which is nothing,
and there's still

14:33.942 --> 14:35.495
a couple people I could ask.

14:36.565 --> 14:37.393
- Who?

14:40.362 --> 14:42.019
Mom and Dad?
- Why not?

14:42.053 --> 14:43.468
- Joel, no.
- Why?

14:43.503 --> 14:44.676
- They don't have the money.

14:44.711 --> 14:45.850
- Your dad was
just bragging about

14:45.885 --> 14:47.852
his million and change
in mutual funds.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.337
- Yeah, in retirement,
they need that.

14:50.372 --> 14:51.580
- I'd check it out first.

14:51.614 --> 14:53.685
I'd only ask if
it was rock solid.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.378
- It's a start-up, Joel,
anything could go wrong.

14:56.412 --> 14:58.242
You know that from GTI.

14:58.276 --> 14:59.968
And if it went bad
they would blame you

15:00.002 --> 15:01.866
and I can't even imagine
what that would do to us.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.350
- Yeah, but what if
it went really well?

15:03.385 --> 15:05.559
- They're family,
it's too risky.

15:05.594 --> 15:07.113
Promise me you won't ask.

15:10.771 --> 15:11.945
- [sighing] Okay.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.360
We'll figure something out.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.675
[water spraying]

15:26.477 --> 15:29.756
[electronic music]

15:29.790 --> 15:31.068
[ball cracking]

15:31.102 --> 15:32.483
- You were right.

15:32.517 --> 15:34.209
Feels good to be out here.

15:34.243 --> 15:35.106
- I told you.

15:36.107 --> 15:38.178
You got screwed, kid.

15:38.213 --> 15:40.077
You just need to
blow off some steam.

15:42.182 --> 15:43.425
- So you said you
got some friends

15:43.459 --> 15:45.392
that might need a
financial advisor?

15:45.427 --> 15:47.049
Nicolaus, thanks for meeting me.

15:47.084 --> 15:47.981
- [Nicolaus] Are you kidding?

15:48.016 --> 15:49.776
You got news for me, right?

15:49.810 --> 15:51.812
- My client is ready
to pull the trigger,

15:51.847 --> 15:54.091
but first I need
to see XVR work.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.508
- Lester's very secretive
about his process, Joel.

15:57.542 --> 15:58.371
- I need to meet him, too.

15:58.405 --> 15:59.959
You ever regret it?

16:02.030 --> 16:02.962
- Regret what?

16:04.239 --> 16:07.759
- Playing it safe,
back in the day.

16:07.794 --> 16:11.004
- Why, you got something
we should be looking at?

16:11.039 --> 16:14.387
- Look, he's also busy.

16:14.421 --> 16:16.803
XVR isn't exactly finished.

16:16.837 --> 16:20.289
Once we have the capital
he'll work out the bugs,

16:20.324 --> 16:21.601
then it'll be ready to demo.

16:21.635 --> 16:23.361
- Do I look like an idiot?

16:23.396 --> 16:26.675
I'm not investing my client's
resources sight unseen.

16:26.709 --> 16:29.436
Well, to be honest, something
did come across my radar.

16:31.059 --> 16:34.062
And it could be a
good opportunity for
the right investor.

16:35.270 --> 16:36.719
- I understand your
need to be thorough,

16:36.754 --> 16:39.032
but you're not the only
guy we're talking to, Joel.

16:39.067 --> 16:41.034
The offer's not on the
table indefinitely.

16:41.069 --> 16:42.622
We need a commitment now,

16:43.795 --> 16:45.487
or we're gonna go
with somebody else.

16:48.559 --> 16:49.732
- Then good luck, Nick.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.150
- Joel, wait a second.

16:57.119 --> 16:58.707
[ball cracking]

16:58.741 --> 17:01.434
[panel beeping]

17:01.468 --> 17:03.988
[tense music]

17:12.444 --> 17:14.618
- It's a work in progress.

17:26.114 --> 17:27.977
Lester Cooper, founder.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.672
Joel Eastman-Green, our backer.

17:32.706 --> 17:34.053
- Nice to meet you, Lester.

17:35.606 --> 17:36.434
- Yeah.

17:38.126 --> 17:40.680
Yeah, yep, you too, you too.

17:41.543 --> 17:43.855
Okay, let's get this going.

17:45.478 --> 17:48.515
Over here on this side we
have your alternate reality.

17:48.550 --> 17:51.794
Over on that side,
it's you, the user.

17:51.829 --> 17:54.970
- So, what does XVR stand for?

17:55.004 --> 17:56.765
- Extreme Virtual Reality.

17:58.007 --> 17:58.836
He made it up.

18:03.427 --> 18:06.326
[computer beeping]

18:17.199 --> 18:18.718
- [Joel] Let's go.

18:22.963 --> 18:27.106
- Okay, listen up,
'cause there's rules.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.384
Number one, the code is unstable

18:29.418 --> 18:31.040
so stay in the environment
you wake up in.

18:31.075 --> 18:33.664
Don't go opening
any doors, alright?

18:33.698 --> 18:36.011
This is for your own safety.

18:37.288 --> 18:41.016
Number two, don't
underestimate XVR.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.535
It's gonna feel
like your real body.

18:42.569 --> 18:45.779
It's not your real body, it
can be kind of disorienting.

18:45.814 --> 18:50.163
Number three, avoid
mirrors at all costs.

18:50.198 --> 18:52.683
Seeing yourself in
somebody else's body

18:52.717 --> 18:55.720
can kind of fry your brain.

18:58.758 --> 18:59.966
- [Joel] I should mention I did

19:00.000 --> 19:02.520
just have a big
meal before this.

19:02.555 --> 19:04.039
- I'm serious.

19:04.073 --> 19:06.938
It can cause anything from
delusions to flashbacks.

19:06.973 --> 19:07.870
You don't want it.

19:09.355 --> 19:11.667
Alright, I'm gonna be
monitoring your experience.

19:11.702 --> 19:13.152
You break my rules,

19:14.843 --> 19:16.051
I will unplug you.

19:17.397 --> 19:19.192
I'm not gonna risk
everything I worked for

19:19.227 --> 19:21.401
just because he gets
curiouser or stupid.

19:24.232 --> 19:25.060
One more thing.

19:26.820 --> 19:31.825
Everything in this room
and everything in here,

19:32.481 --> 19:33.172
it's proprietary.

19:34.311 --> 19:38.073
If you betray that there
will be consequences.

19:38.107 --> 19:38.936
- I got it.

19:43.941 --> 19:46.150
[syringe squelching]

19:46.185 --> 19:47.427
No, no, no, whoa, whoa!

19:47.462 --> 19:49.084
What is that for?

19:49.118 --> 19:50.396
- It's what makes it work.

19:52.639 --> 19:55.746
[needle pricking]
[Joel yelping]

19:55.780 --> 19:56.609
- Jesus!

19:58.680 --> 20:00.129
- Count back from a hundred.

20:03.788 --> 20:06.550
[computer beeping]

20:06.584 --> 20:07.413
- 100.

20:08.414 --> 20:09.242
99,

20:10.519 --> 20:11.348
98,

20:12.487 --> 20:13.315
97,

20:14.489 --> 20:15.317
96,

20:16.456 --> 20:17.285
95...

20:18.493 --> 20:23.360
[Joel mumbling]
[high-pitched droning]

20:23.394 --> 20:25.741

[tense music]

22:43.845 --> 22:47.676
[Joel breathing heavily]

22:47.711 --> 22:48.574
- [Nicolaus] Well?

22:53.924 --> 22:55.166
- It felt real.

22:56.236 --> 22:57.030
- [Nicolaus] And the cat?

22:57.065 --> 22:57.859
You like the cat?

22:59.757 --> 23:00.724
- It was moving.

23:03.209 --> 23:06.074
- [Lester] Well, you feel
sick, dizzy, lightheaded?

23:06.108 --> 23:10.250
- I, uh, I cut my toe
and I threw up, but,

23:12.252 --> 23:13.668
I feel fine.

23:13.702 --> 23:15.773
- [Nicolaus] You're not
confused about who you are?

23:19.570 --> 23:23.229
- Actually, I feel
more like myself

23:23.263 --> 23:24.644
than I have in a
really long time.

23:24.679 --> 23:26.853
- [Nicolaus] See, I
told you it was ready.

23:28.752 --> 23:31.099
So, you in?

23:43.801 --> 23:46.632
[change rattling]

23:51.222 --> 23:52.672
- Thank you, sir, thank you.

23:52.707 --> 23:54.053
Have a nice day.

24:01.957 --> 24:02.924
[Joel humming]

24:02.958 --> 24:04.650
- Hey, how's the play going?

24:04.684 --> 24:06.652
- I'm not a bad actor, am I?

24:06.686 --> 24:07.480
- What?

24:07.515 --> 24:08.999
Of course, not, why?

24:10.518 --> 24:13.831
- That audition that I
got, I didn't get the part.

24:13.866 --> 24:15.419
I asked the director
why and he said

24:15.454 --> 24:18.318
that I wasn't committing.

24:18.353 --> 24:20.562
I wasn't believable.

24:20.597 --> 24:22.012
Believable, what
does that even mean?

24:22.046 --> 24:23.289
- It means he's an idiot.

24:23.323 --> 24:24.566
You're great at what you do.

24:24.601 --> 24:26.430
Maybe his play sucks.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.431
- It's Shakespeare.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.330
- Oh.

24:30.365 --> 24:33.817
Well, you know, why don't we
just take a break tonight?

24:33.851 --> 24:36.682
Have a little fun,
a little wine.

24:36.716 --> 24:37.752
A little more fun.

24:37.786 --> 24:39.788
- No. [laughs]

24:40.858 --> 24:41.756
I'm gonna practice.

24:41.790 --> 24:43.274
I'm gonna crack this thing.

24:43.309 --> 24:44.690
And then I'm gonna go
down there tomorrow

24:44.724 --> 24:46.623
and ask for a re-audition.

24:46.657 --> 24:49.039
- Well, if he thinks you
don't have commitment

24:49.073 --> 24:51.179
that will certainly show him.

24:51.213 --> 24:52.318
[glasses clinking]

24:52.352 --> 24:54.389
- Will you help me?

24:54.423 --> 24:55.908
- I would love to.

24:58.220 --> 25:00.326
- You're in a good mood.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.362
- Am I?

25:02.397 --> 25:03.536
Hadn't noticed.

25:03.571 --> 25:05.642
- Yeah, something's different.

25:05.676 --> 25:06.781
What did you do today?

25:07.954 --> 25:09.300
- Nothing.

25:09.335 --> 25:11.648
I was looking for work.

25:11.682 --> 25:13.201
Come on, let's do the scene.

25:13.235 --> 25:14.064
Who am I?

25:19.000 --> 25:20.553
- Milk, three Splendas.

25:20.588 --> 25:23.383
- Oh, Joel, thank you so much!

25:23.418 --> 25:24.592
Have a nice day!

25:24.626 --> 25:26.490
- Bye bye.
- Thank you.

25:29.355 --> 25:31.840
[tense music]

25:43.542 --> 25:45.751
[knocking]

25:58.729 --> 25:59.627
- [Nicolaus] Joel?

25:59.661 --> 26:00.835
- Hey, I brought us some coffee.

26:00.869 --> 26:02.250
And I thought I might
take another spin

26:02.284 --> 26:04.459
in the, uh. [whistling
and chuckling]

26:04.493 --> 26:06.047
Is the chair open?

26:06.081 --> 26:08.083
- No, it's not, Joel.

26:08.118 --> 26:09.947
Did anyone follow you here?

26:09.982 --> 26:11.397
- Why?

26:11.431 --> 26:13.226
- XVR is for clients only.

26:13.261 --> 26:14.503
You're not a client, Joel.

26:14.538 --> 26:15.988
You need to leave.

26:16.022 --> 26:17.852
- Nicolaus, I'm protecting
my client's investment.

26:17.886 --> 26:20.095
- Lester and I
appreciate you coming

26:20.130 --> 26:21.545
through for us, Joel, we do.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.961
And when we start making
money, so will everyone else.

26:23.996 --> 26:26.481
But the financing phase is over.

26:26.515 --> 26:27.724
- Come on.

26:27.758 --> 26:29.277
I think I'm entitled
to see our progress.

26:29.311 --> 26:30.554
- You know how it works.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.556
You need to leave.

26:35.214 --> 26:37.043
- How about we let
Lester decide, huh?

26:37.078 --> 26:38.631
If he wants me out of
your hair I'll scram.

26:38.666 --> 26:41.185
- Lester's busy, and I'm not
bothering him with this, Joel.

26:41.220 --> 26:43.429
And frankly, I got a
lot of work to do, too.

26:45.017 --> 26:47.467
- Okay, okay, alright,
you know what?

26:47.502 --> 26:48.399
I apologize.

26:48.434 --> 26:50.367
I did kind of barge in here.

26:51.575 --> 26:52.403
- It's fine.

26:53.991 --> 26:55.510
I know you're anxious,

26:55.544 --> 26:57.788
but you gotta let
us do our thing

26:57.823 --> 27:00.135
and I promise you
won't regret it.

27:00.170 --> 27:01.827
- You're right, it's
just that, you know,

27:03.242 --> 27:04.450
doing that the other day,
it really affected me.

27:04.484 --> 27:07.246
- And I wanna hear
more about that.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.627
Why don't we grab
a drink sometime?

27:08.661 --> 27:10.145
- Yes, drinks, let's get drinks.

27:10.180 --> 27:11.491
- [Nicolaus] Next week.

27:11.526 --> 27:12.320
- I'll call you.

27:12.354 --> 27:13.252
- [Nicolaus] Okay!

27:13.286 --> 27:14.460
- Enjoy the coffee.

27:14.494 --> 27:17.049
And keep up the,
you know. [chuckles]

27:17.083 --> 27:17.912
- Alright.

27:25.782 --> 27:27.715
[panel beeping]

27:27.749 --> 27:30.752
[suspenseful music]

27:41.211 --> 27:42.039
- Hello?

28:27.775 --> 28:30.260
[tense music]

28:49.624 --> 28:52.558
[computer beeping]

28:55.457 --> 28:56.286
Oh, fuck.

29:02.879 --> 29:05.019
[syringe squelching]

29:05.053 --> 29:07.228
[sighing]

29:14.994 --> 29:17.894
[computer beeping]

29:35.635 --> 29:37.948
[whooshing]

29:40.848 --> 29:44.265
[Joel breathing heavily]

29:50.340 --> 29:53.101
[sinister music]

30:32.658 --> 30:35.247
[upbeat music]

30:56.509 --> 30:59.478
[people chattering]

31:02.481 --> 31:05.035
[horn honking]

31:28.990 --> 31:31.613
- [Policeman] Hey,
hey, kid, hey.

31:31.648 --> 31:32.476
You pay for that?

31:35.997 --> 31:36.860
- No.

31:36.895 --> 31:37.723
- [Policeman] No?

31:41.900 --> 31:42.693
- Fuck.

31:45.524 --> 31:47.595
- Hey, hey kid,
I'm talking to you!

31:47.629 --> 31:48.492
- Fuck off!

31:48.527 --> 31:50.080
- Fuck off?

31:50.115 --> 31:51.392
[thudding]

31:51.426 --> 31:52.600
Gimme your hand.

31:54.498 --> 31:55.327
You little!

31:55.361 --> 31:56.328
[thudding]

31:56.362 --> 31:57.156
Fuck!

31:58.019 --> 31:59.089
You're dead!

31:59.124 --> 32:00.504
Screw you, little punk!

32:00.539 --> 32:02.610
[choking]

32:02.644 --> 32:05.993
[dramatic frantic music]

32:06.027 --> 32:07.339
[spraying]
[screaming]

32:07.373 --> 32:08.202
God!

32:10.204 --> 32:11.757
- Holy shit!

32:11.791 --> 32:12.723
- You're dead!

32:12.758 --> 32:14.415
You're fucking dead!

32:14.449 --> 32:17.107
[siren blaring]

32:34.435 --> 32:36.609
[panting]

32:41.683 --> 32:44.410
[water dripping]

33:09.780 --> 33:12.507
[dramatic music]

33:19.204 --> 33:20.205
[door crashing]

33:20.239 --> 33:21.758
- No!

33:21.792 --> 33:23.967
[panting]

33:32.251 --> 33:34.564
- [Jessica] And the director
didn't want to see me either,

33:34.598 --> 33:35.703
but I would not take
no for an answer.

33:35.737 --> 33:37.153
I was so nervous I was shaking.

33:37.187 --> 33:39.569
I didn't get any sleep
the night before.

33:39.603 --> 33:40.708
And I just,

33:40.742 --> 33:41.536
babe, are you okay?

33:41.571 --> 33:42.848
- Huh, what?

33:42.882 --> 33:44.091
Yeah.

33:44.125 --> 33:45.609
Then what happened?

33:45.644 --> 33:47.956
- So I got up on the stage and
I looked the director right

33:47.991 --> 33:50.373
in the eyes like it
was just me and him.

33:50.407 --> 33:52.064
I don't remember
what happened next.

33:52.099 --> 33:54.342
All I know is that
I got the part!

33:54.377 --> 33:55.930
- Hey!

33:55.964 --> 33:57.207
- That's wonderful, honey.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.831
You know, Joel, I was reading
an article the other day

34:00.866 --> 34:03.593
about a tech bubble and
they said that the kind of

34:03.627 --> 34:07.528
thing that happened at
GTI was like an epidemic.

34:07.562 --> 34:09.460
That's what they called it.

34:09.495 --> 34:11.635
You don't think there's
anything to worry about, do you?

34:11.670 --> 34:14.811
- Even if there is a bubble
there's good ideas, too.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.951
People that are leveraged
in those will watch

34:16.985 --> 34:18.366
their investment
grow, you'll see.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.264
I wouldn't worry about it.

34:20.299 --> 34:22.922
- Technology, it's
so complicated.

34:22.956 --> 34:24.268
It moves so fast.

34:24.303 --> 34:26.685
How can anybody
keep a bead on it?

34:26.719 --> 34:29.239
That's why our money's
in an IRA, right honey?

34:29.274 --> 34:30.447
- Exactly.

34:30.482 --> 34:31.966
- It's people we
have to worry about.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.245
Did you know the Richardson's
had their house broken into?

34:35.280 --> 34:38.524
This is supposed to be one
of the nice neighborhoods.

34:38.559 --> 34:40.699
I don't know what's
happening to this city.

34:40.733 --> 34:43.114
- Mom, some people
don't have what we have.

34:43.150 --> 34:45.221
- I know, because
we work for it.

34:45.255 --> 34:47.982
- [Jessica] We have that
opportunity, others don't.

34:48.016 --> 34:49.603
- And what, that's our fault?

34:49.639 --> 34:52.607
- It is if we ignore
the circumstances
that they come up in.

34:52.641 --> 34:54.126
- Please.

34:54.161 --> 34:55.541
At least your husband has
a head on his shoulders.

34:55.576 --> 34:58.510
Joel, tell her about
that hobo you got rid of.

34:59.476 --> 35:00.857
- What?

35:00.891 --> 35:02.617
- That old homeless lady
harassing people on the street.

35:02.652 --> 35:05.068
Oh, she is an eyesore!

35:05.103 --> 35:05.965
- The one by the cafe?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.519
She's nice.

35:07.553 --> 35:11.488
- Joel, I saw you and
her in a shouting match.

35:11.523 --> 35:12.731
You don't have to be ashamed.

35:12.765 --> 35:13.732
- When was this?

35:14.871 --> 35:16.183
- The other day.

35:16.217 --> 35:17.632
I was having lunch
with some people

35:17.667 --> 35:19.324
who wouldn't have
approved, otherwise,

35:19.358 --> 35:21.981
I would have gone over
and congratulated you.

35:22.016 --> 35:23.569
- That's ridiculous, I like her.

35:23.604 --> 35:26.745
I don't make a point of
harassing people I like.

35:26.779 --> 35:29.230
We ought to do more for
people like that, a lot more.

35:29.265 --> 35:31.336
- Joel, I don't know
why you're denying it.

35:31.370 --> 35:32.475
I know what I saw.

35:32.509 --> 35:34.097
- Mom, it wasn't him.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.512
And you're being ignorant.

35:36.375 --> 35:38.446
[laughs]

35:38.481 --> 35:39.861
- Ignorant?

35:39.896 --> 35:41.794
This from the actress?

35:41.829 --> 35:43.624
- What's that supposed to mean?

35:43.658 --> 35:45.108
- It means other
people foot the bill

35:45.143 --> 35:46.489
so you can play dress up.

35:47.628 --> 35:48.974
- Mom, you guys
got me into acting.

35:49.008 --> 35:51.735
You took me to lessons,
paid for my training.

35:51.770 --> 35:54.359
- Well, I didn't think you'd
take it this seriously.

35:54.393 --> 35:56.464
- Wow, Mom, maybe you should
take some acting lessons.

35:56.499 --> 35:59.398
It might do you some good to
walk in someone else's shoes.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.816
[tense music]

36:03.851 --> 36:05.404
- I hope I didn't
keep you waiting.

36:05.439 --> 36:06.336
- Hey.

36:06.371 --> 36:07.579
- We just got a new client.

36:07.613 --> 36:09.615
He loves XVR, but
he's a handful.

36:09.650 --> 36:11.272
- Who is he?

36:11.307 --> 36:14.586
- Client privacy's
the cornerstone of
our business, Joel.

36:14.620 --> 36:17.382
That's what they need to feel
in order to work with us.

36:18.486 --> 36:19.522
You know what?

36:19.556 --> 36:21.800
I never gave you a finder's fee.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.692
- [Ward] Is everything okay?

36:51.726 --> 36:53.556
- Yeah, great.

36:53.590 --> 36:56.524
I, uh, just put something
in your account.

36:56.559 --> 36:57.870
- Already?

36:57.905 --> 36:59.355
- Yeah.

36:59.389 --> 37:02.703
And, uh, there's gonna be a
lot more coming soon, too.

37:02.737 --> 37:03.945
- Wow.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.430
Enough for a down
payment on a house?

37:05.464 --> 37:06.638
- Sure.

37:06.672 --> 37:09.227
You getting into real
estate after all?

37:09.261 --> 37:10.987
- Just the house
across the street.

37:15.992 --> 37:17.200
For you and Jessica.

37:21.963 --> 37:23.620
- Ward, this is your retirement.

37:23.655 --> 37:25.173
You need to hold on to it.

37:25.208 --> 37:28.522
- Well, didn't you say that
there'd be more coming soon?

37:28.556 --> 37:31.697
- Yeah, but you shouldn't be
giving it away, not even to me.

37:31.732 --> 37:33.596
- Well, it's not a gift, Joel.

37:33.630 --> 37:35.114
It's an investment.

37:35.149 --> 37:39.464
We want our daughter and any
of our grandchildren close by.

37:39.498 --> 37:41.362
And the way I see it,

37:41.397 --> 37:43.640
this is our best shot
at making that happen.

37:45.263 --> 37:49.508
It's yours if you're
willing to stay.

37:49.543 --> 37:52.546
[upbeat jazz music]

37:53.409 --> 37:55.307
- They're not bad.

37:55.342 --> 37:56.170
In small doses.

38:00.381 --> 38:03.177
They're just a
different generation.

38:03.211 --> 38:06.594
And they do, they love us.

38:06.629 --> 38:07.664
- What's not to love?

38:09.770 --> 38:10.598
- And I, um,

38:12.807 --> 38:16.604
I feel like I could make
something of myself here.

38:17.674 --> 38:19.055
There's more options.

38:19.089 --> 38:20.470
I could have a career.

38:20.505 --> 38:21.333
- Me, too.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.922
- Really?

38:23.956 --> 38:25.544
- Yeah.

38:25.579 --> 38:27.650
I don't miss the
West coast at all.

38:28.927 --> 38:29.790
- I don't either.

38:32.724 --> 38:34.208
Okay, then it's settled.

38:38.385 --> 38:41.629
- I, uh, have a little
surprise for you.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.668
- A surprise for me, what is it?

38:45.702 --> 38:47.463
- I want to show you.

38:55.747 --> 38:56.575
Hang on.

39:00.752 --> 39:02.788
- [Jessica] Where are we going?

39:02.823 --> 39:06.309
[both chattering and laughing]

39:06.344 --> 39:07.483
- You pushed me.

39:07.517 --> 39:11.487
- I'm sorry! [laughs]

39:11.521 --> 39:13.247
Where are you taking me?

39:13.281 --> 39:14.213
- Walk straight.

39:14.248 --> 39:15.042
- Okay.

39:15.076 --> 39:16.457
- Straight ahead.

39:18.459 --> 39:19.287
Eyes closed.

39:19.322 --> 39:20.392
- They're closed.

39:20.427 --> 39:22.083
And your hand is over my--

39:22.118 --> 39:25.052
- Alright, alright, shh, shh.
- Okay, okay.

39:25.086 --> 39:26.087
- Go for it.

39:29.332 --> 39:30.402
- Oh, my God.

39:32.059 --> 39:32.887
What?

39:36.546 --> 39:37.789
It's beautiful.

39:40.930 --> 39:41.758
What is it?

39:42.863 --> 39:43.691
- It's ours.

39:44.554 --> 39:46.107
- Ours, what, how?

39:46.142 --> 39:48.938
- Okay, so you
remember that little

39:48.972 --> 39:50.526
opportunity I told you about?

39:51.768 --> 39:55.393
Well, I moved on it and
it's going really well.

39:57.429 --> 39:58.913
- Where did you get the money?

40:00.501 --> 40:01.364
- From your dad.

40:02.986 --> 40:06.404
He saw an opportunity and
he wanted to help us out.

40:06.438 --> 40:07.853
- But I asked you
not to do that.

40:07.888 --> 40:10.373
- I know, but I had
to jump on this.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.099
For us.

40:12.133 --> 40:14.273
I mean, look at this place.

40:14.308 --> 40:15.620
It's beautiful!

40:15.654 --> 40:17.173
Wait till you see the kitchen.

40:20.487 --> 40:21.833
Jess, I'm sorry, but,

40:23.766 --> 40:24.836
it all worked out.

40:26.389 --> 40:27.286
You know?

40:27.321 --> 40:29.116
We got the house and your dad

40:29.150 --> 40:31.049
is in line to make
some serious money.

40:34.949 --> 40:38.021
[cell phone ringing]

40:40.230 --> 40:41.231
- Just take the call.

40:44.234 --> 40:46.305
- [Sonny] Joel, hey, it's
not too late to call, is it?

40:46.340 --> 40:48.480
- Sonny, I don't know why
you're calling me at all.

40:48.515 --> 40:49.757
- [Sonny] Look, I'm
sorry, it's just,

40:49.792 --> 40:51.000
I'm in the city
I wanted to meet.

40:51.034 --> 40:52.277
- Sonny, I'm not interested.

40:52.311 --> 40:54.624
- [Sonny] Joel, please,
I'll come to you, man.

40:54.659 --> 40:55.694
Let me buy you lunch?

40:57.800 --> 41:00.319
[Joel sighing]

41:11.779 --> 41:14.782
- Hey, what happened
to the nice old lady

41:14.817 --> 41:16.232
that used to hang
out out front there?

41:16.266 --> 41:17.854
- Oh, Miss Miriam?

41:17.889 --> 41:19.097
She's dead.

41:19.131 --> 41:21.893
The cops found her
in the park, beaten.

41:21.927 --> 41:23.584
It was brutal.

41:23.619 --> 41:25.206
Whoever did it deserves to die.

41:29.107 --> 41:30.004
$3.85.

41:33.352 --> 41:34.699
Wait a minute.

41:34.733 --> 41:36.770
Weren't you yelling
at her the other day?

41:36.804 --> 41:37.598
- What?

41:37.633 --> 41:38.461
Of course, not.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.911
- No, yeah, it was you.

41:39.945 --> 41:41.119
What's your deal, man?

41:41.153 --> 41:42.914
You fucking yell
at homeless people?

41:42.948 --> 41:43.777
- Hey, hey, hey.

41:43.811 --> 41:45.364
It wasn't me, okay?

41:45.399 --> 41:46.193
You're confused.

41:48.160 --> 41:48.954
Keep the change.

41:50.577 --> 41:54.753
- I'm just saying
I, uh, I should have
had your back on GTI.

41:54.788 --> 41:55.582
- Thanks, Sonny.

41:55.616 --> 41:56.444
What can I do for you?

41:59.620 --> 42:01.484
- I came to ask
your forgiveness.

42:03.555 --> 42:04.901
- Forgiveness?

42:04.936 --> 42:06.938
- Yeah, it's just
something I needed to do.

42:08.215 --> 42:10.735
You know, after GTI,
Ventura got skittish.

42:10.769 --> 42:13.669
They're talking about
investigating everything.

42:13.703 --> 42:15.463
We've all got a black
spot on our records now.

42:15.498 --> 42:16.982
I can't find a job.

42:17.017 --> 42:17.845
- Tragic.

42:20.848 --> 42:21.677
- Yeah.

42:22.885 --> 42:23.989
You heard about Craig?

42:25.577 --> 42:27.061
Shot himself.

42:27.096 --> 42:28.304
- What?

42:28.338 --> 42:30.824
- Yeah, blew his brains
out in his wife's car.

42:31.756 --> 42:32.998
- Jesus.

42:33.033 --> 42:34.828
- That's what made me
wanna talk, you know.

42:34.862 --> 42:37.244
It made me think about
how I left things.

42:38.763 --> 42:39.591
- Really?

42:41.248 --> 42:42.939
- So what have you
been up to, man?

42:42.974 --> 42:44.527
I gotta tell you, you look good.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.185
- Yeah, I found some work
pretty quick, actually.

42:47.219 --> 42:48.013
- See?

42:48.048 --> 42:50.568
I, man, I knew it.

42:50.602 --> 42:51.741
You're already
downtown, aren't you?

42:51.776 --> 42:53.018
Killin' it!

42:53.053 --> 42:55.124
What, are you working
at a hedge fund?

42:55.158 --> 42:56.574
- No, start up.

42:56.608 --> 42:57.540
- Oh.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.611
- One that actually makes money.

42:59.646 --> 43:00.750
- Really?

43:00.785 --> 43:02.614
- It's pretty
exciting, actually.

43:02.649 --> 43:03.546
- What are you gonna do?

43:03.581 --> 43:04.961
Wait, wait, let me guess.

43:04.996 --> 43:05.824
Biotech?

43:06.894 --> 43:08.551
No, uh, health care?

43:08.586 --> 43:09.414
- No.

43:10.277 --> 43:11.381
- [Sonny] Cloud storage?

43:11.416 --> 43:12.762
- Jesus, stop.

43:13.970 --> 43:14.971
It's VR.

43:16.110 --> 43:17.249
- I have always wanted
to get into that.

43:17.284 --> 43:18.872
It's so cool!

43:19.804 --> 43:20.943
Who you working with?

43:20.977 --> 43:23.497
- It's a small
shop, just two guys.

43:23.531 --> 43:26.673
One of them's the neuro
engineer, Lester Cooper.

43:27.812 --> 43:29.779
And the other's
just the money guy.

43:29.814 --> 43:32.679
Guy I went to school with,
actually, Nicolaus Veazy.

43:32.713 --> 43:35.233
[dramatic music]

43:35.267 --> 43:36.096
What?

43:36.959 --> 43:37.822
- Veazy?

43:38.961 --> 43:41.308
Yeah, I did a deal
with Nicolaus Veazy.

43:41.342 --> 43:42.861
- So?

43:42.896 --> 43:44.345
- You remember secured email?

43:45.761 --> 43:47.417
So like, six years ago,
Veazy's out in LA pitching

43:47.452 --> 43:50.662
this app that's supposed to
make your phone unhackable.

43:50.697 --> 43:51.836
He had all these A-list clients.

43:51.870 --> 43:53.458
I was in for half a million.

43:53.492 --> 43:55.943
Then we come to find
he's using the app to spy

43:55.978 --> 43:57.669
on the very people he's
supposed to be working for.

43:57.704 --> 43:59.360
He was blackmailing them.
- Bullshit.

43:59.395 --> 44:01.535
- I got the emails to prove it.

44:01.569 --> 44:03.641
And when I threatened
to go to the cops that

44:04.676 --> 44:07.127
son of a bitch blackmailed me.

44:07.161 --> 44:09.647
He put the app on my phone
without my knowing it.

44:09.681 --> 44:10.993
I got skeletons in
my closet, Joel,

44:11.027 --> 44:12.477
so I let him take the money.

44:12.511 --> 44:14.548
- Sonny, you're
fucking with me, right?

44:14.582 --> 44:17.068
- I got no reason
to lie to you, Joel.

44:17.102 --> 44:19.691
Nicolaus Veazy is a
straight up con artist

44:19.726 --> 44:21.797
who will do anything
to make a quick buck.

44:23.730 --> 44:25.628
We used to call
him Sleazy Veazy.

44:33.429 --> 44:36.328
- Hey, what's going on?

44:37.640 --> 44:39.297
Thanks for calling first.

44:39.331 --> 44:40.539
- Sorry.

44:40.574 --> 44:42.749
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

44:43.888 --> 44:45.199
- You know what?

44:45.234 --> 44:46.614
Perfect timing.

44:46.649 --> 44:47.546
I need to show you something.

44:47.581 --> 44:49.031
Why don't you come inside?

44:49.065 --> 44:50.757
- Do you know Sonny Seagraves?

44:54.968 --> 44:55.796
- Seagraves?

44:57.833 --> 44:59.697
Yeah, I fucking
know Seagraves, why?

44:59.731 --> 45:01.008
What did he do, slander me?

45:02.354 --> 45:05.323
He's got an ax to grind
because I bested him in a deal.

45:05.357 --> 45:07.325
- He says you blackmailed him.

45:07.359 --> 45:08.809
[laughs]

45:08.844 --> 45:11.778
- Yeah, and he threw you
under the bus at Ventura.

45:12.779 --> 45:14.263
You gonna listen to him?

45:14.297 --> 45:16.058
Come on, let's go inside.

45:16.092 --> 45:17.404
- How did you meet Lester?

45:18.957 --> 45:19.786
- How'd we meet?

45:20.787 --> 45:22.409
- It's a pretty simple question.

45:25.653 --> 45:26.482
- Look, Joel,

45:29.519 --> 45:34.179
getting any business off the
ground is a delicate operation.

45:34.214 --> 45:36.768
And, in my experience,
it's right when

45:36.803 --> 45:38.632
things start to heat
up that partners

45:38.666 --> 45:40.289
start second-guessing
each other.

45:41.635 --> 45:43.948
That tends to put everyone's
investment at risk.

45:47.503 --> 45:50.230
But I completely understand
your inquisitiveness, though.

45:50.264 --> 45:51.887
It's what makes
you a shrewd guy.

45:53.302 --> 45:55.407
But when the dice
finally do roll your way

45:55.442 --> 45:56.995
you've gotta learn to enjoy it.

46:03.484 --> 46:05.417
- Bring both of them.

46:05.452 --> 46:08.489
What about that steak place
on Broadway your dad likes?

46:08.524 --> 46:10.043
- [Jessica] Isn't
that place expensive?

46:10.077 --> 46:11.492
- [Joel] It's fine, I'm buying.

46:11.527 --> 46:12.804
- [Jessica] Okay,
I'll talk to them.

46:12.839 --> 46:14.737
What time do you
think we should meet?

46:15.980 --> 46:16.774
Joel?

46:18.327 --> 46:19.535
Joel, are you there?

46:19.569 --> 46:22.296
[train dinging]

46:22.331 --> 46:23.332
Joel, hello?

46:26.059 --> 46:26.887
Joel?

46:28.095 --> 46:32.962
- Hey, Jess, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

46:32.997 --> 46:35.689
[ominous music]

46:46.873 --> 46:49.737
[subway rattling]

47:00.024 --> 47:02.992
[people chattering]

47:06.099 --> 47:09.102
[suspenseful music]

47:41.513 --> 47:42.342
- Hello?

47:44.033 --> 47:45.655
Joel, are you here?

47:47.726 --> 47:48.555
Hey.

47:50.074 --> 47:51.627
What a frustrating rehearsal!

47:51.661 --> 47:53.732
This director keeps
giving me the same note

47:53.767 --> 47:55.976
and I'm like, what
do you want from me?

47:56.011 --> 47:57.978
He said I need you
to be more like Tom.

47:58.013 --> 48:00.394
Tom's the other actor.

48:00.429 --> 48:03.950
He's a drunk and
miserable to work with.

48:03.984 --> 48:06.021
But it's true, he walks onstage

48:06.055 --> 48:07.746
and he completely transforms.

48:10.266 --> 48:12.510
Last night I had a dream.

48:12.544 --> 48:14.788
It's opening night
and I walk offstage

48:14.822 --> 48:19.172
and I can't get out of Viola,
like I'm trapped in her.

48:20.035 --> 48:21.968
And it was really scary at first

48:22.002 --> 48:25.868
because I couldn't
stop thinking like her,

48:25.903 --> 48:27.007
talking like her.

48:28.112 --> 48:31.287
But then the next
night, I steal the show.

48:36.051 --> 48:36.914
Are you okay?

48:45.405 --> 48:46.854
What is this?

48:46.889 --> 48:49.892
- It's a real guy.

48:53.516 --> 48:54.483
- Did you know him?

48:56.692 --> 48:57.486
Joel, talk to me.

48:57.520 --> 48:58.349
What's going on?

48:59.246 --> 49:00.799
- I was him.

49:00.834 --> 49:02.525
- What do you
mean, you were him?

49:02.560 --> 49:05.252
- It's not a simulation, XVR.

49:06.219 --> 49:09.498
They're using real people.

49:11.155 --> 49:12.363
- The company you work for?

49:12.397 --> 49:13.812
- Jess, this is
gonna sound crazy,

49:13.847 --> 49:16.781
but they are somehow
allowing their clients

49:17.713 --> 49:19.957
to inhabit other
peoples' bodies.

49:21.372 --> 49:22.960
- Joel, what are
you talking about?

49:22.994 --> 49:24.099
- They do whatever they want.

49:24.133 --> 49:26.135
They jump out
whenever they need to.

49:26.170 --> 49:28.172
I bet none of those
crimes were even his.

49:28.206 --> 49:29.518
- Joel, do you hear
yourself right now?

49:29.552 --> 49:31.002
This is insane.

49:31.037 --> 49:32.038
You sound like a lunatic.

49:32.072 --> 49:32.935
- I did it.

49:34.281 --> 49:35.179
Twice.

49:36.352 --> 49:38.251
You sit in a chair,
you put on a helmet.

49:38.285 --> 49:41.219
You get knocked out, you wake
up, you're somebody else.

49:41.254 --> 49:42.600
You think it's
fake, but it's real.

49:42.634 --> 49:44.119
I know because I went there.

49:46.880 --> 49:49.883
- Okay, even if you could do
this, why would anyone want to?

49:51.402 --> 49:52.990
- If you could be someone else

49:53.024 --> 49:56.165
without consequences
imagine what you could do.

49:58.305 --> 49:59.686
- Joel, you need
to call the police.

49:59.720 --> 50:01.067
- They have your parents' money.

50:01.101 --> 50:03.379
If they find out that I
know that money is gone.

50:03.414 --> 50:05.036
- I asked you not to
get involved with this.

50:05.071 --> 50:06.244
You didn't listen.

50:06.279 --> 50:07.142
- I didn't know it was
gonna turn out this way.

50:07.176 --> 50:08.384
- Call the police.

50:12.492 --> 50:13.286
Where are you going?

50:13.320 --> 50:14.804
- To get the money.

50:14.839 --> 50:16.047
- How, Joel?

50:16.082 --> 50:17.669
- They don't know I know.

50:17.704 --> 50:20.086
Privacy is their weakness.

50:20.120 --> 50:23.468
If I can get my hands on the
client list Nicolaus will deal.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.157
[sighing]

51:50.728 --> 51:53.696
[suspenseful music]

52:12.301 --> 52:14.131
- I fucking told
you what I'm doing!

52:14.165 --> 52:16.098
Ow, goddamn it!

52:16.133 --> 52:18.894
[men chattering]

52:20.137 --> 52:21.759
I'm fine!

52:21.793 --> 52:23.278
I'm fine, no.

52:23.312 --> 52:25.763
Yeah, I'm walking
into the lab now.

52:25.797 --> 52:28.904
I told you, yes
Nicolaus, you fucker!

52:28.938 --> 52:30.423
Did you listen to what I said?

52:31.355 --> 52:32.563
Did you listen to what I said?

52:32.597 --> 52:34.496
I'm just fucking
walking into the lab!

52:36.601 --> 52:38.776
[panting]

52:39.604 --> 52:42.607
[Lester chattering]

52:49.856 --> 52:51.547
Yeah, yeah.

52:51.582 --> 52:52.928
Well, is the weather nice?

52:57.381 --> 53:00.729
Don't, no, no, no, don't
interrupt me, okay?

53:00.763 --> 53:01.592
I'm thinking.

53:02.938 --> 53:06.424
No, not with you out seducing
the rich and depraved.

53:09.738 --> 53:11.326
Yeah, yeah, Bridgewater.

53:15.606 --> 53:17.228
No, no.

53:17.263 --> 53:20.300
It is not secure that is what
I've been fucking saying!

53:21.474 --> 53:24.649
We need guards with
guns, like yesterday.

53:26.099 --> 53:26.927
Yeah.

53:27.790 --> 53:30.414
No, no, I could not find him.

53:31.622 --> 53:33.555
What the fuck did I
just say, Nicolaus?

53:33.589 --> 53:35.798
I just fucking said
I couldn't find him!

53:35.833 --> 53:37.490
I don't know where he is!

53:37.524 --> 53:38.732
Fuck!
[clattering]

53:38.767 --> 53:41.010
And you, you've gotta
stop fucking taking any

53:41.045 --> 53:43.565
new clients before we get
this shit on lockdown.

53:43.599 --> 53:45.360
I swear to fuck!

53:45.394 --> 53:48.017
Anyone we do take on
we've got to screen them

53:48.052 --> 53:50.227
more thoroughly than
that nosy fucker, Joel.

53:51.228 --> 53:54.300
[clicking]
[dramatic music]

53:54.334 --> 53:55.162
I gotta go.

53:59.581 --> 54:02.618
Well, [gun clicking]

54:02.653 --> 54:04.241
speak of the devil.

54:04.275 --> 54:05.932
What the fuck are
you doing back there?

54:05.966 --> 54:07.382
- Lester, I'm sorry, I, I--

54:07.416 --> 54:08.314
- [Lester] Huh?

54:08.348 --> 54:09.211
- I had to check on the--

54:09.246 --> 54:10.385
- Did you?

54:10.419 --> 54:11.972
Shut up, get the fuck
out here, come on.

54:12.007 --> 54:13.526
- I'll wreck it!

54:13.560 --> 54:16.322
- You'll wreck my chair, Joel?

54:16.356 --> 54:18.220
[laughs]

54:18.255 --> 54:22.328
That's okay, we
got other chairs.

54:22.362 --> 54:23.605
- Look, I'm sorry.

54:23.639 --> 54:25.262
I shouldn't be here.
- Shut the fuck up.

54:25.296 --> 54:26.815
Come on, come on.
- I'm sorry, I--

54:26.849 --> 54:27.781
[grunting]

54:27.816 --> 54:29.300
- Shit!

54:29.335 --> 54:30.784
[thudding]
[yelling]

54:30.819 --> 54:33.753
[crashing]

54:33.787 --> 54:35.720
Fucking damn it!

54:35.755 --> 54:37.481
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

54:37.515 --> 54:38.344
Fuck!

54:39.724 --> 54:40.553
Fuck you!

54:41.381 --> 54:44.142
[dramatic music]

54:47.629 --> 54:49.389
- [Operator] 911,
what's your emergency?

54:49.424 --> 54:50.287
- Hello?

54:50.321 --> 54:51.391
I need a car.

54:53.082 --> 54:54.325
Someone's after me.

54:54.360 --> 54:56.154
- [Operator] Who do you
think is after you, sir?

54:56.189 --> 54:57.742
- I just want my
family to be safe.

54:57.777 --> 54:58.985
- [Operator] Sir,
you gotta explain

54:59.019 --> 55:00.814
to me what's going on first.

55:00.849 --> 55:01.815
- Fuck.

55:01.850 --> 55:03.438
- [Operator] Are
you still there?

55:03.472 --> 55:05.681
[panting]

55:07.096 --> 55:07.994
- Oh, fuck.

55:16.968 --> 55:19.799
[phone whooshing]

55:52.763 --> 55:54.937
[sighing]

55:57.077 --> 56:01.150
- Look, all I need is
my in-law's money back

56:01.185 --> 56:02.980
and you'll never
hear from me again.

56:06.328 --> 56:07.294
- We still need it.

56:08.434 --> 56:10.815
And I have no guarantee
you'd keep your word.

56:12.679 --> 56:13.611
- I'm not asking.

56:20.135 --> 56:22.137
Those names will go public.

56:22.171 --> 56:23.656
People are gonna be after you.

56:27.004 --> 56:28.281
Do we have a deal or not?

56:47.818 --> 56:51.131
- Okay, what's
wrong, what's wrong?

56:51.166 --> 56:52.409
What are you doing?

56:52.443 --> 56:54.100
I see that.

56:54.134 --> 56:55.446
Joel, come here!

56:56.930 --> 56:57.828
Talk to me!

57:00.071 --> 57:03.592
Joel, Joel, don't,
no, don't do that!

57:03.627 --> 57:04.559
No, please!

57:06.388 --> 57:07.700
No, don't!

57:07.734 --> 57:09.080
- I'm sorry, lady!

57:09.115 --> 57:10.530
[thudding]

57:10.565 --> 57:13.740
[Miriam screaming]

57:13.775 --> 57:15.121
- That's not me.

57:18.365 --> 57:19.643
- It looks like you, Joel.

57:21.127 --> 57:23.060
Sounds like you, too.

57:23.094 --> 57:24.337
- I didn't do that.

57:24.371 --> 57:25.200
- I know that.

57:26.512 --> 57:29.204
He knows that, but
nobody else ever will.

57:29.238 --> 57:30.964
- Who the fuck is that?

57:30.999 --> 57:33.346
- When you become someone
else they become you.

57:35.175 --> 57:36.211
You didn't know that?

57:37.902 --> 57:40.560
I'm sorry, I didn't know
what you figured out

57:40.595 --> 57:41.941
with all your snooping around.

57:41.975 --> 57:43.874
I said, clients only!

57:46.670 --> 57:49.224
And as far as the Green's
money goes, it's gone.

57:51.053 --> 57:52.952
And if I or Lester ever
hear from you again,

57:52.986 --> 57:55.920
including whatever
leverage you think you have

57:55.955 --> 57:59.441
with that list,
this will go public.

58:10.383 --> 58:12.972
[somber music]

58:39.861 --> 58:41.000
- I already told them.

58:43.071 --> 58:46.177
- There's, um, more
you don't know.

58:47.938 --> 58:50.561
- More than everything we
own tied up with criminals?

58:52.908 --> 58:55.532
- It's, I can't get it back.

58:57.257 --> 58:58.086
It's gone.

59:01.365 --> 59:03.125
- What do you mean, it's gone?

59:03.160 --> 59:03.988
- It's gone.

59:05.127 --> 59:06.370
There's nothing I can do.

59:07.336 --> 59:08.165
- Get out.

59:09.200 --> 59:10.374
- Jess, I'm so so--

59:10.408 --> 59:11.237
- Get out!

59:45.823 --> 59:48.446
[somber music]

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.656
[engine revving]

01:01:58.266 --> 01:02:00.889
[dramatic music]

01:02:58.602 --> 01:03:00.259
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:03:09.026 --> 01:03:11.546
[tense music]

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.690
[subway rattling]

01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:46.684
- Yeah, white rice.

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:48.686
Uh-huh.

01:03:53.381 --> 01:03:54.209
Cancel that.

01:04:25.344 --> 01:04:26.586
- Where'd you move them?

01:04:27.725 --> 01:04:28.623
- Oh, shit.

01:04:39.185 --> 01:04:40.911
- [Joel] Where's the equipment?

01:04:40.946 --> 01:04:42.050
- That's all you need.

01:04:43.258 --> 01:04:44.259
You know, a little
more time and I

01:04:44.294 --> 01:04:45.916
wouldn't even need the chairs.

01:04:45.951 --> 01:04:46.779
- Have a seat.

01:04:49.955 --> 01:04:50.921
- No, no, no fucking way, man.

01:04:50.956 --> 01:04:52.509
- Have a fucking seat.

01:05:04.486 --> 01:05:05.315
Where's Nicolaus?

01:05:06.212 --> 01:05:09.008
- I don't know.
[cat meowing]

01:05:10.216 --> 01:05:12.391
- Tell me where he is
or I strap in the cat.

01:05:14.531 --> 01:05:15.912
- It doesn't work like that.

01:05:20.882 --> 01:05:22.815
- Let's find out.

01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:23.747
- Okay, wait, wait, wait!

01:05:23.781 --> 01:05:26.992
Wait, just, he went out West.

01:05:27.026 --> 01:05:27.889
Okay?

01:05:29.028 --> 01:05:31.168
Don't switch me with
that fucking cat!

01:05:31.203 --> 01:05:32.376
- [Joel] Where?

01:05:32.411 --> 01:05:33.170
- [Lester] Menlo Park.

01:05:33.205 --> 01:05:34.723
Now would you let me go?

01:05:34.758 --> 01:05:36.173
- [Joel] Why's he out there?

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:39.521
- I don't know, some conference
or fundraising or some shit.

01:05:39.556 --> 01:05:40.902
Look, you don't need me.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.386
What are you even
gonna do with me?

01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:45.217
I told you what you
wanted, just let me go!

01:05:47.874 --> 01:05:51.361
Whoa, whoa, you don't know
what you're doing with that.

01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:53.259
Put that down, come on.

01:05:53.294 --> 01:05:56.124
- This was just to
knock us out, wasn't it?

01:05:56.159 --> 01:05:59.714
Then you could move us
around, do whatever you want.

01:05:59.748 --> 01:06:00.542
- Fuck you!

01:06:02.475 --> 01:06:04.684
[thudding]

01:06:04.719 --> 01:06:07.480
[dramatic music]

01:06:25.912 --> 01:06:28.812
[computer beeping]

01:06:59.774 --> 01:07:02.018
[whooshing]

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.030
[groaning]

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.069
- What the fuck
are you doing, man?

01:07:22.279 --> 01:07:23.901
Fucking chair.

01:07:23.936 --> 01:07:27.802
You fucking cuffed me to
the fucking chair, man?

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:28.941
What the fuck?

01:07:29.976 --> 01:07:31.564
Lemme the fuck out of here, man!

01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:33.359
Where's the fucking key?

01:07:33.394 --> 01:07:34.947
Where's the fucking key, man?

01:07:36.121 --> 01:07:38.468
What the fuck?
[thudding]

01:07:44.405 --> 01:07:45.233
- Okay.

01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:03.079
[cell phone ringing]

01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:04.735
- [Nicolaus] What's up?

01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:05.771
I'm busy.

01:08:05.805 --> 01:08:06.737
- We need to talk.

01:08:08.187 --> 01:08:09.637
- [Nicolaus] Okay, what's up?

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.949
- In person.

01:08:11.984 --> 01:08:13.503
- [Nicolaus] I'm in California.

01:08:13.537 --> 01:08:14.366
What's going on?

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:17.334
- It's Joel.

01:08:18.404 --> 01:08:22.098
He, uh, he's out of the picture.

01:08:23.788 --> 01:08:25.791
Whatever deal you
made, it didn't stick.

01:08:27.274 --> 01:08:28.897
- [Nicolaus] Dead?

01:08:28.932 --> 01:08:32.384
- He was snooping around
our Bridgewater location.

01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:33.832
I didn't have any choice.

01:08:33.868 --> 01:08:35.627
- [Nicolaus] Jesus, Les!

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.528
So what's the problem?

01:08:38.562 --> 01:08:42.014
- Is there any way you
could come back sooner?

01:08:42.048 --> 01:08:43.464
- [Nicolaus] Financing
takes time, Les.

01:08:43.497 --> 01:08:45.983
Not everybody's as greedy
and desperate as Joel.

01:08:47.468 --> 01:08:48.952
- Okay, then I'm
coming out there.

01:08:48.986 --> 01:08:51.229
- [Nicolaus] I can hear you
just fine right now, Les.

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:52.265
What's on your mind?

01:08:53.439 --> 01:08:58.134
- Ever since I had to,
uh, handle Joel, I just,

01:08:59.307 --> 01:09:00.481
I don't know, I'm
a little shook up.

01:09:00.515 --> 01:09:02.759
I just, I don't
feel right anymore.

01:09:02.792 --> 01:09:05.865
- [Nicolaus] Since when do
you care about feelings?

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:09.317
- I told you we
needed to have guards!

01:09:09.352 --> 01:09:11.733
I told you we needed to
hit pause on this thing!

01:09:11.768 --> 01:09:13.734
Fuck, Nicolaus!

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:15.979
You didn't listen to me!

01:09:16.013 --> 01:09:17.600
You left me to do
all the dirty work!

01:09:17.636 --> 01:09:19.776
- [Nicolaus] Okay,
okay, calm down.

01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:22.158
- Don't tell me to calm down.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:25.540
I can't do this shit alone!

01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:32.444
- [Nicolaus] Get a flight.

01:09:36.068 --> 01:09:38.898
[plane whooshing]

01:10:03.613 --> 01:10:05.235
[speaking foreign language]

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:07.513
[knocking]

01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:09.619
- $200,000.

01:10:12.967 --> 01:10:15.452
Look, I have to call you back.

01:10:17.868 --> 01:10:19.801
Jesus, Lester, you
look like shit.

01:10:27.878 --> 01:10:30.156
[groaning]

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:50.694
- Fuck!

01:10:57.598 --> 01:10:59.634
[laughs]

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:11.681
[clattering]

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.525
[tense music]

01:11:37.776 --> 01:11:40.123
[squirting]

01:12:09.394 --> 01:12:14.364
[breathing heavily]
[dramatic music]

01:12:18.264 --> 01:12:21.060
[crunching]

01:12:21.095 --> 01:12:23.994
[liquid trickling]

01:12:25.686 --> 01:12:28.067
- So, tell me, Lester,

01:12:28.102 --> 01:12:31.001
how many people did
you fuck in that thing?

01:12:31.036 --> 01:12:32.624
Or kill?

01:12:32.658 --> 01:12:34.729
What, suddenly you
got a conscience now?

01:12:38.526 --> 01:12:40.597
- It was different with Joel.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.704
- Yeah, but you hated him.

01:12:53.472 --> 01:12:54.818
- I know it sounds crazy,

01:12:57.787 --> 01:12:59.547
but when he was
begging me for mercy

01:13:01.307 --> 01:13:04.828
I looked into his eyes and
I saw something familiar.

01:13:08.729 --> 01:13:10.386
I can't explain it, but I,

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:13.906
I felt bad for him.

01:13:17.289 --> 01:13:20.257
- Well, I don't feel a
bit of guilt about Joel.

01:13:20.292 --> 01:13:22.812
I told him to stay away
and he broke the rules.

01:13:24.296 --> 01:13:25.470
- What about the others?

01:13:27.506 --> 01:13:28.749
[laughs]

01:13:28.783 --> 01:13:30.647
- What do you want me to
do, justify everything?

01:13:33.236 --> 01:13:34.755
- I think I need to hear it.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:40.036
- Okay, fine.

01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:45.835
For one thing, if society
actually cared about

01:13:45.869 --> 01:13:48.424
these people we'd never
be able to do what we do.

01:13:49.597 --> 01:13:51.461
So whose fault is that?

01:13:51.496 --> 01:13:53.394
And two, if they
end up in prison

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.983
at least there they
get three square meals.

01:13:56.017 --> 01:13:58.123
Hell, half the time
they're better off.

01:13:59.365 --> 01:14:01.264
- Jimmy Dale's mugshot
didn't look too happy.

01:14:01.298 --> 01:14:02.334
- I never said happy.

01:14:03.369 --> 01:14:04.198
I said better off.

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:05.441
- And when we kill them?

01:14:06.856 --> 01:14:07.753
- It's a mercy.

01:14:10.515 --> 01:14:12.689
You know what it feels
like to have nothing?

01:14:13.897 --> 01:14:15.968
I mean, to really have nothing?

01:14:18.695 --> 01:14:20.007
I know I'd rather be dead.

01:14:25.426 --> 01:14:26.738
Feel better?

01:14:26.772 --> 01:14:27.601
- A little.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.021
- Hey, what the fuck?

01:14:34.055 --> 01:14:34.953
Les?

01:14:34.987 --> 01:14:37.645
- You know, before coming here

01:14:38.991 --> 01:14:40.476
[gun clicking] I didn't know.

01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:44.790
I didn't know if I was
gonna kill you or what.

01:14:44.825 --> 01:14:45.619
- What?

01:14:45.653 --> 01:14:46.861
Why?

01:14:46.896 --> 01:14:48.311
Come on, man, I did
everything you asked.

01:14:48.345 --> 01:14:53.005
- Not everybody's as
greedy and stupid as Joel.

01:15:00.150 --> 01:15:01.324
- Where's Lester?

01:15:01.358 --> 01:15:03.222
- You are gonna
wire that money back

01:15:03.257 --> 01:15:05.397
into my wife's
account, all of it.

01:15:05.431 --> 01:15:07.123
- Joel, now wait a minute.
- Now!

01:15:11.955 --> 01:15:14.302
And the video of
me and Miss Miriam.

01:15:14.337 --> 01:15:15.165
- Who?

01:15:16.339 --> 01:15:17.996
- The woman you killed.

01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:19.307
Erase the video.

01:15:19.342 --> 01:15:22.069
- Okay, listen, Joel, I wasn't,

01:15:22.103 --> 01:15:23.691
what I said, look,
I was just saying

01:15:23.726 --> 01:15:25.382
what I thought you
wanted to hear.

01:15:25.417 --> 01:15:26.625
I mean, I thought
you were Lester!

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.385
I don't believe in
any of that stuff.

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.386
I'm a good guy!

01:15:29.421 --> 01:15:30.871
- Shut up and get on with it.

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:33.425
- There, see?

01:15:33.459 --> 01:15:34.253
It's done.

01:15:34.288 --> 01:15:35.289
It's in her account.

01:15:37.222 --> 01:15:38.223
- And the video?

01:15:38.257 --> 01:15:39.120
- I deleted it.

01:15:40.018 --> 01:15:41.502
I swear.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.367
- How do I know there's
not another copy?

01:15:44.401 --> 01:15:46.334
- There's no more copies.

01:15:46.369 --> 01:15:48.785
You gotta believe me!

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:51.339
[tense music]

01:15:52.927 --> 01:15:53.756
- I do.

01:15:55.792 --> 01:15:57.380
I do believe you.

01:15:57.414 --> 01:15:58.415
- Thank you.

01:16:03.731 --> 01:16:05.319
What are you doing?

01:16:06.182 --> 01:16:08.253
Okay, now wait a minute, Joel.

01:16:08.287 --> 01:16:09.116
Okay.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.360
I admit it, okay?

01:16:12.395 --> 01:16:13.327
I'm greedy, okay?

01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:15.053
I'm a greedy motherfucker.

01:16:15.087 --> 01:16:17.987
But Lester, he's a psychopath!

01:16:18.021 --> 01:16:20.092
It's gonna take both
of us to stop him.

01:16:21.162 --> 01:16:22.785
After that I'll turn myself in.

01:16:22.819 --> 01:16:24.821
I'll come clean, I'll
make it right, I promise!

01:16:24.856 --> 01:16:28.756
But for the good of everyone
now, let's work together.

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:33.830
- I'm done making deals.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.009
[gun firing]

01:16:49.432 --> 01:16:52.435
[breathing heavily]

01:17:37.825 --> 01:17:40.932
[cell phone ringing]

01:17:54.497 --> 01:17:55.947
- Jessie.

01:17:55.981 --> 01:17:57.880
- [Jessica] Joel.

01:17:57.914 --> 01:17:59.260
How've you been?

01:18:01.953 --> 01:18:03.402
Are you there?

01:18:03.437 --> 01:18:04.265
- Yeah.

01:18:06.336 --> 01:18:07.924
- [Jessica] You sound different.

01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:12.653
- I know.

01:18:16.553 --> 01:18:18.245
I'm not feeling like myself.

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:20.661
- [Jessica] Where are you?

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.908
- Don't worry about me, Jessie.

01:18:28.945 --> 01:18:30.360
Listen, I really need to go.

01:18:31.465 --> 01:18:33.467
- [Jessica] Joel, I, um,

01:18:35.262 --> 01:18:37.782
I saw the money and I
just, I wanted to say,

01:18:38.783 --> 01:18:39.611
thank you.

01:18:40.888 --> 01:18:43.477
[somber music]

01:18:45.928 --> 01:18:47.584
- I just wanted
to make it right.

01:18:50.208 --> 01:18:52.313
- [Jessica] How did
you get it back?

01:18:52.348 --> 01:18:53.280
- It's complicated.

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.077
- [Jessica] Jesus, Joel,
now I'm worried about you.

01:18:59.044 --> 01:19:03.428
Look, I'd like to see you if
you want to see me, I mean...

01:19:04.601 --> 01:19:05.810
- I can't, Jessie.

01:19:09.158 --> 01:19:10.607
Too much has changed.

01:19:10.642 --> 01:19:12.748
- [Jessica] Changed,
Joel, what's changed?

01:19:14.439 --> 01:19:16.752
Listen, if you're in
trouble I wanna help you.

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.376
- It's too late.

01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:22.343
- [Jessica] No, it's
not, whatever it is.

01:19:22.378 --> 01:19:23.344
I need you to know

01:19:27.348 --> 01:19:28.280
I still love you.

01:19:32.457 --> 01:19:36.461
- [crying] I don't deserve you.

01:19:38.635 --> 01:19:41.052
- [Jessica] Joel,
I wanna see you.

01:19:45.263 --> 01:19:47.506
[knocking]

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:01.589
- Can I help you?

01:20:01.624 --> 01:20:03.074
- It's me, it's Joel.

01:20:03.108 --> 01:20:04.282
- What?

01:20:04.316 --> 01:20:06.318
- I know, it's crazy,
it's a long story.

01:20:08.527 --> 01:20:09.356
But it's me.

01:20:26.787 --> 01:20:30.929
- I believe it's you,
I think, I don't...

01:20:34.899 --> 01:20:35.761
- I'm sorry.

01:20:37.867 --> 01:20:38.661
- It's okay.

01:20:50.776 --> 01:20:52.882
[gasping]

01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:56.092
It's you, Joel.

01:21:02.098 --> 01:21:03.306
- I'm sorry for

01:21:06.171 --> 01:21:07.172
hurting your family.

01:21:13.316 --> 01:21:14.593
For hurting you and

01:21:21.221 --> 01:21:26.226
for losing us and, [crying]

01:21:29.263 --> 01:21:31.024
becoming this.

01:21:33.267 --> 01:21:34.820
- Can't we get you back?

01:21:34.855 --> 01:21:35.856
I mean, the old you.

01:21:37.616 --> 01:21:39.204
- He's gone, he took the chairs.

01:21:39.239 --> 01:21:42.690
There's nothing we can do.

01:21:48.558 --> 01:21:49.352
I'm stuck.

01:21:55.427 --> 01:21:56.221
- It's okay.

01:21:58.810 --> 01:21:59.811
It's gonna be okay.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.333
We'll figure it out.

01:22:04.367 --> 01:22:06.542
I don't know how, but we'll
figure it out together.

01:22:16.621 --> 01:22:18.830
[sighing]

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:29.737
What?

01:22:32.016 --> 01:22:33.224
- Nothing.
- Am I doing something wrong?

01:22:33.258 --> 01:22:35.674
- No, no, it's just--
- Joel.

01:22:39.402 --> 01:22:40.748
I've missed you.

01:22:42.198 --> 01:22:43.889
Oh, I've missed you.

01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:46.099
- Jessie.

01:22:50.068 --> 01:22:51.552
I've missed you too, but--

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:53.623
- But what?

01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:00.561
- It's not,

01:23:02.322 --> 01:23:03.495
I'm not me.

01:23:08.535 --> 01:23:09.363
- Yes, you are.

01:23:18.234 --> 01:23:19.995
- Hold on!
- Joel.

01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:20.857
- Wait.

01:23:32.524 --> 01:23:33.318
Careful.

01:23:35.424 --> 01:23:38.254
[Jessica gasping]

01:23:48.126 --> 01:23:49.231
- I want you.

01:23:54.753 --> 01:23:58.309
- Uh, Jessie, it's too soon.

01:23:58.343 --> 01:23:59.655
- I know it feels that way.

01:24:01.105 --> 01:24:05.040
You just have to get into
character, this'll help.

01:24:07.525 --> 01:24:09.699
Just get into it, come on.

01:24:10.976 --> 01:24:12.357
- Jessie.

01:24:12.392 --> 01:24:13.841
- [Jessica] Why aren't
you getting into it?

01:24:13.876 --> 01:24:14.946
- Okay, come on.
- No, Joel!

01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:23.472
- What is wrong
with you, Jessica?

01:24:23.506 --> 01:24:24.542
- What's wrong with me?

01:24:24.576 --> 01:24:26.958
What's wrong with you, Joel?

01:24:26.992 --> 01:24:28.856
I've accepted you.

01:24:28.891 --> 01:24:30.065
I've forgiven you.

01:24:30.099 --> 01:24:32.860
- But I am not me!

01:24:32.895 --> 01:24:34.414
- Is it because I'm not
beautiful enough for you?

01:24:34.448 --> 01:24:35.760
- No!

01:24:35.794 --> 01:24:36.692
I mean, yes!

01:24:36.726 --> 01:24:40.592
- Good, because I want you.

01:24:40.627 --> 01:24:42.146
I want you.

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.423
I want you!

01:24:43.457 --> 01:24:45.735
[thudding]

01:24:48.497 --> 01:24:51.707
[gun clicking]

01:24:51.741 --> 01:24:54.192
I was very happy
when you had Nicolaus

01:24:54.227 --> 01:24:56.229
put the money back
in our account.

01:24:57.264 --> 01:25:00.129
I never had more
fun at the bank.

01:25:00.164 --> 01:25:02.304
[Jessica laughs]

01:25:02.338 --> 01:25:03.822
- Lester.

01:25:03.857 --> 01:25:04.685
- Lester!
