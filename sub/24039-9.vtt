00:00.344 --> 00:02.231
Previously on,<i> "The</i>
<i>Arrangement"...</i>

00:02.718 --> 00:05.487
In two weeks, I am marrying
the love of my life.

00:05.650 --> 00:08.051
<i>Your costar clearly
has feelings for you.</i>

00:08.053 --> 00:09.085
<i>I've seen it.</i>

00:09.087 --> 00:10.211
We could fix this.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.274
The man just fired me.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.212
Ah, so you wanna be an actor?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.813
<i>Do me a favor. Leave him alone.</i>

00:14.815 --> 00:16.038
Mason was my friend.

00:16.038 --> 00:17.249
I should be the one to
look out for her son.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.554
She talked about you a lot.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.184
About what a screw-up I am?

00:20.785 --> 00:21.819
What is this?

00:22.093 --> 00:23.168
A role.

00:23.168 --> 00:25.983
- What's this about?
- Julie Woolth. I found her.

00:26.096 --> 00:29.197
I will always credit IHM
with changing my life.

00:29.452 --> 00:31.337
She's lying. You have to go back

00:31.338 --> 00:32.743
and get Julie to talk to you.

00:33.540 --> 00:34.546
Hello?

00:34.908 --> 00:36.441
Terence will ruin everything...

00:36.443 --> 00:38.541
My marriage, my career.

00:38.812 --> 00:40.745
Julie, we need to talk.

00:41.056 --> 00:42.254
Let them stay.

00:42.254 --> 00:43.620
Terence did this to you?

00:43.623 --> 00:45.803
- Terence? No.
- Then who?

00:46.396 --> 00:47.659
What do you know?

00:47.927 --> 00:49.086
Everything.

00:50.930 --> 00:52.664
It just escalated between us,

00:52.664 --> 00:53.647
fast.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.188
I said something to him.
He said something back.

00:58.036 --> 01:00.042
And whatever he said, it just...

01:00.172 --> 01:01.519
Set you off,

01:02.441 --> 01:03.631
like in Venice.

01:04.275 --> 01:06.642
No, no, not like that, it was different.

01:07.273 --> 01:08.457
Different how?

01:08.514 --> 01:10.680
Ah, just, back then, I...

01:10.682 --> 01:11.888
I was different.

01:12.441 --> 01:13.517
It was like...

01:13.519 --> 01:15.385
It was like I was having
an out-of-body experience.

01:15.387 --> 01:17.075
I don't know how else to explain it.

01:18.123 --> 01:19.521
I don't even remember what I did.

01:19.546 --> 01:20.847
I just remember the feeling.

01:23.616 --> 01:25.022
You don't remember?

01:26.865 --> 01:29.099
It's not like I was having
a... a rage blackout,

01:29.101 --> 01:31.215
but my... my brain, I just...

01:35.374 --> 01:36.673
You still haven't told me

01:36.675 --> 01:38.041
why you were even looking for Aaron.

01:38.043 --> 01:39.464
He's in a wheelchair.

01:39.545 --> 01:41.251
- I know...
- No, you don't know.

01:41.794 --> 01:44.072
You don't because you hid him away...

01:44.300 --> 01:45.712
You and Terence.

01:45.834 --> 01:47.501
After what happened with Evan,

01:47.770 --> 01:48.769
what did you do?

01:48.771 --> 01:50.214
Are you crazy?

01:50.306 --> 01:52.072
He tried to rape me, again.

01:52.074 --> 01:53.273
- And you killed him.
- Stop it.

01:53.275 --> 01:54.675
Did you face the consequences?

01:54.677 --> 01:56.476
That was a completely different situation.

01:56.478 --> 01:57.667
When that guy was arrested for it,

01:57.667 --> 01:59.600
did you step forward?

01:59.867 --> 02:01.656
No, you didn't,

02:01.988 --> 02:03.600
because you were scared.

02:04.256 --> 02:07.381
Survival, self-preservation...
It's human nature.

02:09.050 --> 02:10.919
And Terence preserved you...

02:12.089 --> 02:14.847
Your future, your career.

02:15.096 --> 02:16.694
He made it all go away.

02:18.609 --> 02:19.820
So that's it?

02:22.409 --> 02:24.245
That's the reason for the contract.

02:25.362 --> 02:26.445
It's not me.

02:27.442 --> 02:28.557
It's you...

02:29.615 --> 02:30.934
To protect you,

02:31.969 --> 02:33.485
to protect your brand.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.410
There were a lot of reasons

02:35.413 --> 02:36.823
for the contract, Megan.

02:40.851 --> 02:42.347
Why were you looking for him?

02:44.088 --> 02:46.371
Why did you and Zach go
looking for Julie and Aaron?

02:48.752 --> 02:51.117
Please, tell me.

02:56.975 --> 02:58.654
We were trying to hurt Terence.

03:00.510 --> 03:02.687
So you've been lying?

03:03.009 --> 03:04.326
All these months?

03:04.576 --> 03:06.294
About IHM, yeah.

03:06.511 --> 03:08.032
You should've told me.

03:10.248 --> 03:13.022
If I did, would you have
turned your back on Terence?

03:15.153 --> 03:17.324
You're a true believer.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.990
And the last time I told you something,

03:20.992 --> 03:22.599
you turned me in.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.278
You gonna do that again?

03:26.465 --> 03:28.215
You gonna help Aaron go public?

03:29.603 --> 03:32.070
You can't keep a secret
from the world forever.

04:00.556 --> 04:01.988
You were out cold.

04:06.090 --> 04:08.290
Yeah, no, I haven't slept this well since

04:08.825 --> 04:10.256
I don't even know when.

04:10.256 --> 04:11.795
Secrets are a weight.

04:12.225 --> 04:14.147
It's a relief to get them off of you.

04:24.112 --> 04:25.792
We have to make some decisions.

04:26.174 --> 04:27.359
Decisions?

04:27.952 --> 04:29.351
About tomorrow night,

04:30.987 --> 04:32.408
the rehearsal dinner.

04:32.722 --> 04:34.288
We have a lot of choices to make.

04:34.290 --> 04:35.695
There's a lot to get done.

04:35.825 --> 04:37.592
I have a final hair and makeup test,

04:37.703 --> 04:39.219
you have a tuxedo fitting,

04:39.244 --> 04:41.839
and we have to settle on a main course.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.657
Let's go with salmon.

04:48.785 --> 04:50.361
Now, can we talk about last night?

04:51.249 --> 04:52.849
You know, it's normally Zach

04:52.851 --> 04:54.484
that puts emails like this in front of us.

04:54.757 --> 04:56.309
Now you're bringing up Zach?

04:57.035 --> 04:58.785
Well, he's trapped at the Facility.

04:58.786 --> 05:00.156
I can relate.

05:01.088 --> 05:02.521
Can you help me out here?

05:02.523 --> 05:04.529
You hate IHM now, you hate Terence,

05:04.925 --> 05:06.925
yet you're talking about
going to a makeup test

05:06.927 --> 05:09.359
for our IHM wedding which is in three days.

05:09.463 --> 05:10.443
I know.

05:11.465 --> 05:13.121
The wedding of the decade...

05:15.867 --> 05:18.562
I'm not ready to disappoint
millions of people.

05:19.254 --> 05:20.387
Are you?

05:27.095 --> 05:28.290
Where are you going?

05:28.664 --> 05:30.040
A business lunch.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.014
It's not about you.

05:33.677 --> 05:34.969
I'll try to get Zach out.

05:34.970 --> 05:36.490
I'll do my best, but it's not up to me.

05:36.772 --> 05:37.770
I know.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.116
Everything's up to Terence.

05:44.379 --> 05:47.514
Yeah, I heard Gosling's
circling it to produce,

05:47.516 --> 05:49.549
not to mention Scott Rudin, plus,

05:49.783 --> 05:52.072
I hear Jon Favreau's
going after it to direct.

05:52.303 --> 05:53.617
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:53.877 --> 05:55.210
Female underdog blows the whistle

05:55.212 --> 05:56.812
on a big pharmaceutical company?

05:56.814 --> 05:58.634
Please, they're already
engraving the Oscars.

05:58.782 --> 06:00.494
And you're perfect for it.

06:01.488 --> 06:03.388
You can't count on anyone
else to cast you, though.

06:03.391 --> 06:04.844
We have to secure the rights ourselves.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.926
Favreau can work for us, right?

06:06.928 --> 06:08.094
Megan? Uh, Megan?

06:08.096 --> 06:10.163
I just wanna say you look great.

06:10.165 --> 06:12.519
I can't wait to see pics of
you in your wedding dress.

06:12.734 --> 06:14.535
Thank you very much.

06:14.736 --> 06:15.935
Where's Kyle?

06:15.935 --> 06:18.602
Yeah, tell Kyle we love him, like...

06:18.920 --> 06:20.219
Love.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.068
I know you're dealing with a lot right now,

06:25.068 --> 06:26.965
but if we want this project,
we need to get aggressive.

06:27.215 --> 06:29.582
But I haven't even started
shooting "Agent Jane."

06:29.584 --> 06:32.695
Look, you're the one who sent
me "The New York Times" story,

06:32.988 --> 06:34.609
and now it's got real heat.

06:34.609 --> 06:36.642
This role is high-profile,

06:36.644 --> 06:38.911
it's meaty, it will elevate you,

06:38.913 --> 06:40.778
but we have to fight for it.

06:41.716 --> 06:43.249
Are you ready to fight?

06:43.484 --> 06:44.620
I am.

06:46.354 --> 06:47.840
Why are you conflicted?

06:48.155 --> 06:49.433
No, I... I'm not.

06:49.590 --> 06:51.056
You know, Zach's just a kid, all right?

06:51.058 --> 06:52.232
He got confused.

06:52.627 --> 06:55.160
No, he betrayed you. He lost his way.

06:55.162 --> 06:57.196
The Facility will be
good for him and Hudson.

06:57.427 --> 06:59.398
I can't believe I missed that defection.

06:59.849 --> 07:01.227
I'm sure there are others...

07:01.335 --> 07:03.884
People in our midst trying
to hurt me and IHM...

07:04.458 --> 07:06.387
And that is not acceptable, not right now.

07:06.463 --> 07:07.993
Why, because of the wedding?

07:08.231 --> 07:09.586
Yes, but also,

07:10.639 --> 07:12.138
I'm introducing something new.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.331
It's called Vita.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.163
It's IHM's life extension program.

07:16.878 --> 07:18.344
- Life extension?
- Mm-hmm.

07:18.346 --> 07:19.646
Meaning you're actually trying to...

07:19.648 --> 07:21.055
No, the science is real, Kyle.

07:21.260 --> 07:23.694
We are on the verge of
something truly extraordinary.

07:23.852 --> 07:25.185
It's a breakthrough.

07:25.420 --> 07:26.753
This is a game changer for us.

07:26.755 --> 07:27.999
Sounds like it.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.657
Imagine a career that's twice as long.

07:30.903 --> 07:32.898
That would be exhausting but amazing.

07:32.898 --> 07:34.387
I think you'd do incredible things.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.136
I'm introducing it to membership soon.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.882
Having you on board
would help legitimize it.

07:39.942 --> 07:42.319
Yeah, well, you know,
I got your back, always.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.775
So what's, uh...

07:45.775 --> 07:47.884
What's your next move with Zach and Hudson?

07:49.198 --> 07:50.644
Find out who they're working with,

07:50.646 --> 07:52.413
smoke them out, remove them.

07:52.415 --> 07:53.914
What if the damage has been done?

07:54.125 --> 07:56.229
What if it is Julie Woolth
that they're talking about?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.218
I spoke to Julie.

07:58.494 --> 07:59.641
You did?

07:59.951 --> 08:01.984
She said she hasn't heard
from anyone connected to IHM,

08:01.987 --> 08:03.020
seen anyone.

08:03.022 --> 08:04.188
She says all is well,

08:04.190 --> 08:05.956
but I'm not taking any chances.

08:11.230 --> 08:12.896
So you told him everything?

08:12.898 --> 08:13.897
I had to.

08:13.899 --> 08:15.098
I left you out of it.

08:17.536 --> 08:19.198
Okay, so what now?

08:19.198 --> 08:20.815
- I mean, what do you want to do?
- I don't... I have no idea.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.706
Megan, he put someone in a wheelchair.

08:22.708 --> 08:23.721
I know.

08:23.746 --> 08:25.876
He covered it up and
pretended it didn't happen.

08:25.878 --> 08:28.245
Do you think he had a choice
once Terence got involved?

08:28.488 --> 08:29.513
Okay.

08:29.515 --> 08:32.153
What Terence did... awful.

08:32.418 --> 08:34.385
But are you seriously gonna defend Kyle?

08:34.386 --> 08:35.653
No, I'm not defending him.

08:35.655 --> 08:37.221
I'm just trying to make sense of it all...

08:37.222 --> 08:38.316
You can't trust him!

08:38.316 --> 08:41.404
He could be turning you in to
Terence right now as we speak.

08:41.538 --> 08:42.672
I didn't.

08:44.529 --> 08:45.598
Kyle...

08:45.623 --> 08:46.833
How much does she know?

08:47.396 --> 08:48.790
We have to talk to Aaron and Julie,

08:48.792 --> 08:49.791
and we need to move quickly.

08:49.793 --> 08:50.926
They are not safe.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.403
Shaun says it's clear...

09:01.405 --> 09:03.138
None of Terence's people.

09:03.140 --> 09:04.973
And she has a good view of the house.

09:04.975 --> 09:07.025
Somehow, I still feel
like I'm being watched.

09:07.852 --> 09:09.448
You ready for this?

09:16.220 --> 09:17.623
- No!
- Julie.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.514
- How could you bring him here?
- We don't have time for this.

09:19.539 --> 09:20.972
You have to listen to me. You're not safe.

09:20.974 --> 09:22.421
Of course not, not with him here!

09:22.421 --> 09:23.975
Please, take a breath. Terence is on...

09:23.977 --> 09:26.144
Calling... he called me, and I had to lie.

09:26.146 --> 09:27.912
You told me that if Aaron talked to you

09:27.914 --> 09:29.781
that we'd be safe, we'd be protected.

09:29.783 --> 09:31.182
And now you show up

09:31.184 --> 09:33.630
with the person responsible for all of it.

09:34.487 --> 09:37.132
Hey, stay the hell away from him!

09:37.524 --> 09:38.706
Kyle West.

09:40.861 --> 09:43.046
Last time you saw me, I looked like you.

09:48.047 --> 09:50.047
The owners are on vacation.

09:50.072 --> 09:52.339
So we can lay low here for about two weeks

09:52.364 --> 09:53.568
before they get back.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.272
Hopefully we'll have figured
out next steps by then?

09:59.533 --> 10:01.473
We will. We'll come up with a plan.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.354
And tomorrow morning,
I'll go back to your house

10:04.354 --> 10:05.570
and get everything that we didn't have time

10:05.572 --> 10:06.951
- to pack up today.
- Okay.

10:06.951 --> 10:08.174
We need to figure out a way

10:08.174 --> 10:09.561
to make this place work for Aaron.

10:09.561 --> 10:11.361
It's not exactly wheelchair-friendly.

10:11.662 --> 10:14.264
Right, well, we'll all come
back first thing tomorrow

10:14.289 --> 10:15.635
and help set everything up.

10:16.707 --> 10:18.344
Handyman Kyle West.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.915
You sure you wanna scuff up
those pretty little hands?

10:22.722 --> 10:25.489
Okay, let's get the rest
of the stuff from the car.

10:36.146 --> 10:37.274
Well...

10:38.155 --> 10:39.295
Well...

10:40.228 --> 10:42.163
What's the next move here, Kyle?

10:42.564 --> 10:43.783
You tell me.

10:43.783 --> 10:45.565
I'm still trying to sort through all this.

10:45.567 --> 10:48.467
Mm, yeah, must be so overwhelming for you.

10:49.404 --> 10:51.071
You hate me right now. I get it.

10:51.267 --> 10:52.694
I just want Megan to be happy.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.763
- So do I.
- Mm, so you lied to her?

10:55.522 --> 10:57.391
Just like you've been lying to Terence?

10:59.592 --> 11:01.359
You're good. I'll give you that.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.411
He really trusts you.

11:02.436 --> 11:04.166
Not more than he trusts you.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.197
When Megan first asked for my help,

11:06.199 --> 11:07.999
do you know what she said her plan was?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.000
What?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.093
To burn the whole thing down.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.562
IHM?

11:12.562 --> 11:13.953
Exact quote.

11:14.164 --> 11:15.563
That's pretty dramatic.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.608
Look, a lot's happened since then.

11:17.734 --> 11:18.932
True.

11:19.769 --> 11:23.004
But she's actually found
someone who can help her do it.

11:24.127 --> 11:26.807
I know where I stand. Do you?

11:27.444 --> 11:29.754
Are you really ready to help her?

11:41.775 --> 11:43.561
It's been quite the ride.

11:43.793 --> 11:45.560
When the story first came out,

11:45.562 --> 11:47.695
I was too terrified to leave my apartment.

11:47.697 --> 11:49.931
But now here I am, staying
at a place like this,

11:49.933 --> 11:51.532
having drinks with Ryan Gosling.

11:51.861 --> 11:53.334
Eyes you could get lost in.

11:53.572 --> 11:54.816
Not my type.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.499
Well, clearly I can't compete

11:58.499 --> 12:00.233
with the Gosling charm offensive,

12:00.235 --> 12:03.495
but Megan is real talent on the rise.

12:04.112 --> 12:05.521
I love Megan Morrison.

12:05.567 --> 12:08.262
She seems so tough and ballsy, you know?

12:08.263 --> 12:09.396
Oh, I know.

12:09.398 --> 12:11.750
But I wanna talk about you.

12:12.501 --> 12:14.801
Going up against a huge
corporation like that,

12:14.803 --> 12:17.041
I mean, that takes real nerve.

12:17.272 --> 12:19.239
It wasn't an easy
decision... Coming forward...

12:19.241 --> 12:21.283
But once I made it, I felt...

12:22.306 --> 12:23.351
I don't know.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.509
Empowered.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.686
Free.

12:26.748 --> 12:28.448
And scared shitless...

12:28.450 --> 12:30.148
I can only imagine.

12:31.386 --> 12:33.051
But you're a hero.

12:33.722 --> 12:35.155
And you're beautiful.

12:35.157 --> 12:36.333
Beautiful?

12:37.860 --> 12:39.460
Gosling didn't go there.

12:41.063 --> 12:42.349
Listen,

12:42.914 --> 12:45.849
a lot of very powerful men
are gonna try and woo you,

12:45.968 --> 12:48.034
but I really think that your story

12:48.036 --> 12:50.837
needs to be told by women,
and I'll tell you why.

12:50.839 --> 12:52.428
I like you, DeAnn.

12:54.877 --> 12:56.576
I like you too.

12:56.853 --> 12:58.734
I hope you make a strong bid.

13:02.464 --> 13:03.767
I will.

13:04.453 --> 13:06.346
But you should know that

13:06.529 --> 13:08.555
money is just a small part

13:08.557 --> 13:10.885
of what a good producer has to offer.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.627
I gave up everything coming forward...

13:14.166 --> 13:17.604
Benefits, my livelihood, my future.

13:17.933 --> 13:19.858
So money...

13:22.704 --> 13:24.878
it's the only thing I can
really count on at the moment.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.539
Okay, that look all right?

13:38.157 --> 13:39.513
I'll make it work.

13:41.099 --> 13:43.344
We're having muffins
inside if you wanna join.

13:43.596 --> 13:45.993
Oh, nah, I'm good. Not really a muffin guy.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.999
What, are you prepping for
a big role or something?

13:51.214 --> 13:53.781
Oh, wow, you are.

13:53.783 --> 13:56.083
Okay. Dedication.

13:56.488 --> 13:57.774
You know, I, uh...

13:58.120 --> 13:59.954
tried reaching out, calling you,

13:59.956 --> 14:01.299
a couple years ago.

14:01.457 --> 14:03.499
Yeah? And say what?

14:03.773 --> 14:05.143
Ah, just to say that

14:05.628 --> 14:07.537
I can't make up for what I did to you.

14:07.987 --> 14:11.277
I know that, and every
day, I'm trying to...

14:16.072 --> 14:18.606
Jeez, it sounds so trite. It's bullshit.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.387
Seriously, I'm glad Terence
made me change my number.

14:25.102 --> 14:27.860
These last ten years must've been brutal.

14:28.358 --> 14:29.803
I've kept myself busy...

14:30.052 --> 14:32.353
Reading, exercising,

14:32.889 --> 14:34.034
some writing.

14:34.557 --> 14:36.067
I'm working on a novel.

14:40.238 --> 14:41.984
You live the life you have, you know?

14:44.200 --> 14:45.666
Well, it looks like Terence at least

14:45.668 --> 14:47.218
tried to make sure that
you were comfortable.

14:47.872 --> 14:50.371
Terence has owned us for a decade.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.764
His money, his threats.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.749
And now, for the first time in forever,

14:57.747 --> 14:59.168
I feel like I can breathe.

15:01.877 --> 15:03.337
I'm ready to talk,

15:04.093 --> 15:05.430
wherever that leads.

15:09.095 --> 15:10.791
Not what you wanted to hear.

15:11.067 --> 15:12.627
I just don't see what you gain.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.279
Closure, freedom,

15:16.232 --> 15:17.631
not having to live in fear anymore.

15:17.633 --> 15:18.902
By going public?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.668
You realize the attention that brings?

15:21.348 --> 15:23.237
You know, this is not
about getting back at you.

15:23.454 --> 15:24.620
Isn't it?

15:24.645 --> 15:27.090
No. Payback?

15:27.944 --> 15:29.310
Shit is weak.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.249
I used to hate-watch your movies.

15:35.767 --> 15:36.784
Really?

15:36.786 --> 15:39.238
Yeah, pick apart your performances,

15:39.555 --> 15:41.714
which wasn't hard.

15:42.098 --> 15:44.458
Some of that early stuff... Yikes.

15:44.676 --> 15:45.837
Thanks.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.558
But then you got good.

15:48.554 --> 15:49.538
And that,

15:49.989 --> 15:52.187
at first, made me hate you more.

15:53.559 --> 15:54.757
But, uh,

15:55.013 --> 15:57.398
I realized I could lose
myself in your performances.

15:58.136 --> 15:59.958
Root for your characters to win,

15:59.960 --> 16:01.248
grieve when they lost.

16:01.595 --> 16:02.820
And that...

16:03.430 --> 16:04.852
Just feeling that...

16:05.999 --> 16:07.029
Was kind of...

16:08.302 --> 16:09.412
Healing?

16:13.954 --> 16:16.541
Which role was it, when it shifted?

16:19.403 --> 16:20.668
"First Precinct."

16:20.881 --> 16:21.997
Mm.

16:23.019 --> 16:25.116
You were a pretty badass cop, I gotta say.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.718
You'd have been better, though.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.318
That's true.

16:30.216 --> 16:31.754
You're such an asshole.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.001
Come on.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.833
Come eat a muffin, man.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.535
Kyle, what are you doing?

16:43.537 --> 16:44.969
Rehearsal dinner's in a few hours,

16:44.971 --> 16:47.439
and we have to get back
and start to get ready.

16:47.441 --> 16:48.682
We can convince him.

16:50.644 --> 16:53.184
Aaron... I think we can
convince him not to go public.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.342
So that's it?

16:59.788 --> 17:00.718
What?

17:01.205 --> 17:02.664
That's why

17:03.023 --> 17:04.989
you decided to help him... us.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.650
You wanna manipulate him so
you could save your career.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.262
No, I helped him because I owe him.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.701
A happy life, closure,
freedom from Terence...

17:18.271 --> 17:20.003
He told me that he's moved
past what happened, Megan.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.539
He doesn't need payback, okay?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.049
He just wants to live on his own terms.

17:23.074 --> 17:24.442
We can offer him that.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.345
He told me he wants to tell his story.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.547
He does, or you do?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.370
Terence...

17:37.157 --> 17:39.650
he's a bad guy, Kyle.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.977
Look what he does to people.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.195
You're being so black and white.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.630
Isn't this black and white?

17:45.632 --> 17:46.965
No, it's complicated.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.697
Terence is complicated.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.013
He believes in the principles of IHM, okay?

17:52.038 --> 17:54.372
He cares about the people that come to him.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.940
You think he cares about you?

17:55.942 --> 17:57.547
He controls you.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.179
He uses all of this to keep you tied to him

18:01.181 --> 18:02.514
because he needs you.

18:02.516 --> 18:05.450
He's built IHM off of your fame.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.751
Don't you see that?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.318
Of course I see that.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.022
But he's also been there
for me when I had nothing,

18:11.024 --> 18:13.491
when I felt like nothing, and that matters.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.093
After everything else Terence has done,

18:15.095 --> 18:16.711
that will always matter.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.557
I know it will.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.469
But I'm willing to leave.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.947
IHM, Terence...

18:32.879 --> 18:34.203
I'll cut ties.

18:36.910 --> 18:38.216
Are you serious?

18:38.218 --> 18:40.985
Yes, you said it yourself.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.587
He can't hold Aaron
over my head any longer.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.355
He cannot control me.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.921
You've built your whole life...

18:51.631 --> 18:53.097
Your identify...

18:53.378 --> 18:56.288
Around IHM and Terence.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.326
How am I supposed to believe

18:59.328 --> 19:01.370
that now you're willing
to give all of that up?

19:03.199 --> 19:05.147
Because what I'm not willing to give up

19:05.588 --> 19:06.699
is you.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.499
I love you, Megan.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.690
And if I have to choose,

19:13.729 --> 19:15.332
then I choose you.

19:25.070 --> 19:26.769
So the studio's put up a good amount.

19:26.771 --> 19:29.072
I mean, I do have to put
in some of my own money too,

19:29.074 --> 19:30.440
and we're definitely gonna need more

19:30.442 --> 19:31.874
if we wanna be competitive,

19:31.876 --> 19:33.109
but it's a good thing I'm scrappy.

19:33.642 --> 19:34.682
You okay?

19:35.514 --> 19:37.210
I'm fine. I just, uh...

19:38.169 --> 19:40.102
A few months ago, I was in rehab,

19:40.285 --> 19:41.924
and my mom's car accident...

19:42.188 --> 19:44.322
Major rug pull, life-changing.

19:44.324 --> 19:46.257
And now here I am, and I'm an actor.

19:46.259 --> 19:47.625
It's kind of head-spinning...

19:47.627 --> 19:48.926
Excuse me, we need you in makeup in five.

19:48.928 --> 19:50.258
First team. Let's go.

19:50.964 --> 19:53.002
- Listen.
- Yeah?

19:53.433 --> 19:54.838
You're gonna be great.

19:58.438 --> 19:59.937
- Frame.
- Okay.

19:59.939 --> 20:01.096
- Frame.
- Set.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.234
And action.

20:03.676 --> 20:05.009
You have to stop, Joe,

20:05.011 --> 20:06.652
with the calls, the texts.

20:06.652 --> 20:08.179
What we're doing... it's wrong.

20:08.181 --> 20:09.347
Don't you get that?

20:09.349 --> 20:12.020
Yeah, I get it.

20:12.886 --> 20:16.679
But, Mary...

20:17.056 --> 20:18.162
Cut.

20:19.659 --> 20:21.454
Uh, Wes, you okay there, buddy?

20:22.192 --> 20:24.020
I'm good. I, uh...

20:25.131 --> 20:26.731
I just... I lost it.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.247
I'm okay.

20:29.013 --> 20:30.183
I'm ready.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.770
Okay.

20:32.772 --> 20:34.904
And action.

20:35.375 --> 20:37.208
You have to stop, Joe,

20:37.210 --> 20:38.743
with the calls, the texts.

20:38.745 --> 20:40.478
What we're doing... it's wrong.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.671
Don't you get that?

20:45.351 --> 20:46.484
Cut!

20:47.884 --> 20:49.253
I thought you said he was ready.

20:49.255 --> 20:51.255
I said he was green but talented.

20:51.257 --> 20:52.873
Yeah, well, he's definitely green.

20:53.626 --> 20:54.992
Okay, new deal.

20:54.994 --> 20:56.928
Let's turn around on Patricia.

20:59.098 --> 21:00.646
Wes? Wes.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.500
Hey, listen, just breathe.

21:02.502 --> 21:03.468
Just breathe. Come here.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.503
Stay calm. Stay calm.

21:05.505 --> 21:07.305
They're gonna get her coverage first,

21:07.307 --> 21:08.906
and then they're gonna turn around on you.

21:08.908 --> 21:10.041
You've got plenty of time...

21:10.043 --> 21:11.242
To stop screwing up.

21:11.244 --> 21:12.677
I've been... I've been on a set before.

21:13.335 --> 21:14.846
I know how it works.

21:14.848 --> 21:16.296
Okay, do you want me to stay?

21:17.016 --> 21:18.950
No, you... you have the rehearsal dinner.

21:18.952 --> 21:20.239
I can be late.

21:23.623 --> 21:25.756
I, uh... I'll be fine, okay?

21:25.758 --> 21:27.470
You go. Thank you.

21:35.802 --> 21:37.302
Okay, then we don't wait.

21:37.537 --> 21:38.910
We talk to him tonight.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.839
- After the dinner?
- No, during,

21:41.841 --> 21:43.369
when everyone's around.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.009
<i>He'll be relaxed, his guard down,</i>

21:48.248 --> 21:49.847
<i>surrounded by IHM...</i>

21:49.849 --> 21:51.616
<i>All the people who matter to him.</i>

21:51.618 --> 21:53.113
<i>He won't see this coming,</i>

21:53.286 --> 21:54.865
<i>and he won't wanna make a scene.</i>

22:06.466 --> 22:08.069
Three chardonnays, please.

22:08.935 --> 22:10.268
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:10.270 --> 22:11.502
So what's the latest?

22:11.504 --> 22:13.007
Kyle and I have a plan.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.474
Hi.

22:16.476 --> 22:17.808
I didn't see you earlier.

22:17.810 --> 22:19.477
So nice, thank you guys for coming.

22:19.479 --> 22:21.078
When you have a moment later,

22:21.080 --> 22:22.413
I'd like to have a financial conversation.

22:22.415 --> 22:24.315
- Tonight?
- Well, it's time-sensitive.

22:24.317 --> 22:26.051
It's about Megan, actually.

22:26.119 --> 22:28.411
I wanna put together a
development fund for her.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.258
She's got heat. We need to capitalize.

22:31.258 --> 22:32.420
You two look great.

22:32.420 --> 22:35.209
Upstaging us... bad form.

22:36.257 --> 22:37.624
Can I steal you for a toast?

22:37.726 --> 22:38.879
I won't say no to that.

22:38.879 --> 22:40.096
I will join.

22:43.718 --> 22:45.852
Ah, you look stunning, as always.

22:47.355 --> 22:48.315
Thank you.

22:52.405 --> 22:53.498
Thank you.

22:57.866 --> 22:59.281
We have Julie and Aaron.

22:59.601 --> 23:00.833
I'm sorry, Aaron...

23:00.835 --> 23:01.974
We moved them.

23:02.404 --> 23:03.797
Somewhere you can't get them.

23:05.473 --> 23:06.722
Aaron Woolth?

23:07.861 --> 23:09.741
It was you, wasn't it?

23:09.980 --> 23:11.101
Helping Zach.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.381
I knew it.

23:13.383 --> 23:15.083
I knew I could never trust you.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.553
Okay, why don't we all take a breath

23:18.555 --> 23:21.389
and move this conversation
somewhere private?

23:21.391 --> 23:23.024
I think there's been
some kind of confusion...

23:23.026 --> 23:24.392
We're fine right here.

23:24.394 --> 23:25.672
Of course we are,

23:25.996 --> 23:27.564
because this is an ambush, right?

23:29.032 --> 23:30.598
I'm leaving IHM.

23:31.234 --> 23:32.400
What? Why?

23:32.402 --> 23:33.868
Because she told him to.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.136
She's trying to control him.

23:35.138 --> 23:36.972
Wow, are you serious right now?

23:37.025 --> 23:38.050
Megan.

23:38.075 --> 23:40.004
Okay, can somebody please
tell me what's happening?

23:40.043 --> 23:42.043
No one is telling me what to do.

23:42.266 --> 23:43.609
I made a choice.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.289
I love Megan,

23:45.582 --> 23:46.781
and I'm choosing her.

23:46.783 --> 23:48.504
When did this become a choice?

23:48.585 --> 23:51.119
When you kidnapped me,
held me against my will,

23:51.121 --> 23:52.587
stuck a needle in my neck.

23:52.589 --> 23:53.755
I was trying to help you.

23:53.757 --> 23:55.556
You traumatized me.

23:56.593 --> 23:57.988
I won't leave publicly.

23:58.404 --> 23:59.594
I don't wanna embarrass you.

23:59.609 --> 24:00.743
I know that this is

24:00.768 --> 24:02.164
an important time for the institute.

24:02.631 --> 24:05.198
But if you make this more
difficult than it needs to be...

24:05.200 --> 24:06.592
For me or Megan...

24:07.369 --> 24:08.912
Things will get messy.

24:10.272 --> 24:11.838
Kyle, IHM is a part of you.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.307
It's why you're still
here. We both know that.

24:14.776 --> 24:16.056
It's who you are.

24:16.378 --> 24:17.671
It's who I was.

24:19.548 --> 24:20.941
I'm moving forward.

24:21.950 --> 24:23.865
Do you really think you can trust her?

24:24.624 --> 24:26.586
She's broken, damaged,

24:26.588 --> 24:28.154
regressive, and weak,

24:28.370 --> 24:30.190
and she will be your undoing.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.325
Thank you, Terence, for
this wonderful dinner.

24:35.036 --> 24:37.108
We both really appreciate it.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.283
Excuse me, everyone.

24:50.283 --> 24:52.065
Kevin and Mary Ann wanted to say hello.

24:52.703 --> 24:54.060
- Thanks.
- Thank you again.

24:56.104 --> 24:58.367
I haven't seen him anywhere... Terence.

24:59.344 --> 25:01.543
Maybe he just needed a moment alone.

25:04.012 --> 25:05.178
You okay?

25:06.464 --> 25:08.214
I knew it wasn't gonna be easy,

25:08.372 --> 25:09.524
and it wasn't.

25:12.087 --> 25:13.548
Second thoughts?

25:14.780 --> 25:15.709
No.

25:16.969 --> 25:19.592
Well, gotta give it to you.

25:19.594 --> 25:22.220
You certainly know how to
drop a bomb with panache.

25:22.865 --> 25:24.719
I know that this is a lot to process.

25:24.719 --> 25:26.218
What does this mean for us?

25:26.220 --> 25:27.491
Our partnership?

25:27.492 --> 25:29.654
We can still work together
on the right projects.

25:30.202 --> 25:32.095
But other than that, Megan and I...

25:32.245 --> 25:33.362
We're on our own.

25:33.949 --> 25:34.972
Excuse me.

25:39.004 --> 25:41.153
You feel like you've won, don't you?

25:41.867 --> 25:43.006
No.

25:43.853 --> 25:45.304
I feel relieved.

25:46.823 --> 25:49.413
You have no idea the
risks I've taken for you...

25:50.259 --> 25:53.617
For us, our careers, our future.

25:54.497 --> 25:57.264
Sorry, DeAnn, but it's done.

25:57.266 --> 25:58.882
You hate Terence, fine.

25:59.193 --> 26:01.247
But laying all your cards
on the table like that?

26:01.504 --> 26:03.505
That was stupid, Megan.

26:03.706 --> 26:05.060
Impulsive.

26:05.821 --> 26:07.508
In this business, you need to be patient.

26:07.510 --> 26:08.792
Screw patience.

26:09.077 --> 26:10.911
I needed him out of my life.

26:10.914 --> 26:12.650
Well, you've succeeded there.

26:12.882 --> 26:14.916
You've drawn a line in the
sand and made it impossible

26:14.918 --> 26:17.064
for us to work together on anything.

26:18.021 --> 26:19.928
It's time someone drew that line.

26:20.857 --> 26:22.361
It's time we all picked a side.

26:35.833 --> 26:37.300
I've known Kyle...

26:39.570 --> 26:42.003
I've known Kyle for a very, very long time.

26:42.005 --> 26:43.128
And...

26:47.311 --> 26:48.442
Sorry.

26:50.381 --> 26:52.253
I, uh... I worked very hard on this...

26:53.350 --> 26:54.516
This speech.

26:58.672 --> 27:00.666
But if you don't mind, I'm
just gonna speak from the heart.

27:07.764 --> 27:10.110
What do we value in relationships?

27:11.235 --> 27:13.005
Love? Devotion?

27:13.737 --> 27:14.878
Support?

27:15.906 --> 27:17.574
All acceptable answers.

27:19.510 --> 27:21.903
But the one answer I always come back to...

27:22.312 --> 27:23.398
Always...

27:23.981 --> 27:25.055
Is truth.

27:26.850 --> 27:29.353
Every relationship has highs and lows,

27:29.486 --> 27:31.430
but when you're constant, it's truth.

27:32.189 --> 27:33.718
You can overcome anything.

27:35.259 --> 27:38.206
Truth protects us from ego, insecurity,

27:38.796 --> 27:39.894
betrayal.

27:41.632 --> 27:43.439
It's a powerful lesson I've learned.

27:44.802 --> 27:46.231
It's made me a better man...

27:48.033 --> 27:50.198
Better husband, I hope.

27:53.310 --> 27:55.246
And it's a lesson I've
learned from you, Kyle.

27:57.581 --> 27:59.302
We've been through a lot together,

28:00.551 --> 28:03.014
both battled our demons, our doubts.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.045
But we always trusted each other,

28:06.657 --> 28:08.685
even when the thought of
trusting another person

28:08.710 --> 28:10.059
seemed impossible.

28:11.295 --> 28:12.294
And through it all,

28:13.297 --> 28:15.014
we always told each other the truth.

28:17.067 --> 28:18.615
We built our foundation on it

28:20.404 --> 28:23.289
and, in the process,
formed a real partnership

28:24.975 --> 28:28.360
but, more importantly,
an incredible friendship.

28:29.413 --> 28:32.495
And so as you prepare to
take this next step forward

28:33.283 --> 28:34.599
into your future,

28:36.086 --> 28:37.760
I wish you nothing but the truth...

28:38.555 --> 28:41.527
In your life, in your marriage.

28:44.428 --> 28:45.994
Because the most important thing

28:45.996 --> 28:47.406
I've learned from you, Kyle,

28:47.667 --> 28:49.030
in the last ten years

28:50.550 --> 28:52.534
is that truth grows from love.

28:53.737 --> 28:54.841
Real love.

28:57.708 --> 28:59.174
To Kyle and Megan.

29:02.412 --> 29:04.273
To Kyle and Megan.

29:26.570 --> 29:27.909
Take good care of him.

30:25.729 --> 30:28.123
Mm-hmm, yeah, no, it's okay.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.461
I'll do it myself. Yeah.

30:31.034 --> 30:32.387
All right, thanks, Terence.

30:37.341 --> 30:38.926
Why you talking to him?

30:39.776 --> 30:41.476
I was just arranging Zach's release

30:41.478 --> 30:44.397
from the Facility... Timing, logistics.

30:45.549 --> 30:47.159
I have to go pick him up today.

30:47.531 --> 30:48.882
What's your day look like?

30:49.152 --> 30:51.119
I'm gonna go see Aaron and Julie,

30:51.321 --> 30:53.699
tell them the plan, and
deal with the fallout.

30:54.024 --> 30:55.357
Should I meet you over there?

30:55.359 --> 30:58.300
No, it'll be better coming from me.

30:58.495 --> 30:59.861
He's not gonna be happy.

30:59.863 --> 31:01.736
He had his heart set on going public.

31:02.299 --> 31:03.999
I know you can convince him.

31:07.004 --> 31:08.209
I love you,

31:08.972 --> 31:11.255
and I cannot wait to marry you tomorrow.

31:12.349 --> 31:13.678
Me too.

31:40.458 --> 31:41.707
Hey, Wes.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.063
Hi.

31:43.584 --> 31:44.724
Can I come in?

31:50.069 --> 31:52.792
So this is where you live.

31:52.794 --> 31:53.960
Yeah.

31:53.962 --> 31:55.296
Home, sweet home.

31:59.267 --> 32:00.611
Why are you here?

32:01.236 --> 32:03.536
I thought I'd come by, see
how it all went yesterday.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.136
Yesterday.

32:07.309 --> 32:08.535
Right.

32:09.377 --> 32:11.220
I was... I was gonna call you.

32:11.933 --> 32:13.949
Um, but then I didn't

32:14.683 --> 32:15.914
call you.

32:17.433 --> 32:18.904
Call me about what, Wes?

32:20.088 --> 32:21.456
Um...

32:23.391 --> 32:24.673
they fired me.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.609
They fired you, God.

32:30.231 --> 32:31.539
Oh, well?

32:35.573 --> 32:36.907
Did you use?

32:40.382 --> 32:41.885
What did you take, Wes?

32:42.544 --> 32:43.916
You need to tell me.

32:47.716 --> 32:48.836
I just... I...

32:51.926 --> 32:53.389
I didn't wanna feel.

32:54.022 --> 32:56.057
I needed to not feel, you know?

33:00.928 --> 33:02.072
Yeah.

33:02.897 --> 33:03.869
I know.

33:28.336 --> 33:30.434
Aaron? Julie?

33:34.532 --> 33:35.795
Aaron!

33:35.797 --> 33:36.988
Julie!

33:41.408 --> 33:42.974
- Where are they? <i>
- I'm sorry, Megan,</i>

33:42.976 --> 33:44.276
<i>but I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

33:44.278 --> 33:46.075
Yes, you do... Aaron and Julie,

33:46.224 --> 33:47.557
<i>what have you done with them?</i>

33:47.557 --> 33:49.056
Nothing. I don't know where they are.

33:49.059 --> 33:50.459
Bullshit!

33:50.461 --> 33:52.794
Maybe they just left, took off.

33:53.134 --> 33:55.127
- No, no, sh...
- She said Aaron

33:55.127 --> 33:57.582
was finally hopeful and he was happy.

33:57.582 --> 33:58.607
Happy?

33:58.752 --> 34:00.652
Happy to be used as a pawn by you,

34:00.677 --> 34:02.310
<i>as a wedge to separate me from Kyle?</i>

34:02.335 --> 34:03.428
M-me?

34:04.122 --> 34:06.456
You... you've been
threatening them for years.

34:06.458 --> 34:07.791
<i>I was just trying to help them.</i>

34:07.793 --> 34:09.692
This conversation is not productive.

34:09.694 --> 34:11.460
If you... if you do anything,

34:11.463 --> 34:13.062
if you hurt them at all, I swear to God...

34:13.063 --> 34:15.364
<i>We're talking in circles, Megan.</i>

34:15.367 --> 34:17.501
Why don't we focus on
how we proceed from here?

34:17.601 --> 34:20.150
<i>From now on, you're going
to fall back in line,</i>

34:20.844 --> 34:22.146
keep your mouth shut,

34:22.373 --> 34:23.772
and abide by the contract,

34:24.176 --> 34:26.743
<i>or it will be your
secret that goes public.</i>

34:26.745 --> 34:28.002
It was him.

34:30.248 --> 34:32.605
It was Kyle, wasn't it?

34:33.552 --> 34:34.913
<i>He showed you where to find them.</i>

34:36.188 --> 34:39.536
You will marry him tomorrow,
and it will be beautiful,

34:40.125 --> 34:41.440
what the people want.

34:42.561 --> 34:44.288
<i>Do you understand me, Megan?</i>

34:54.973 --> 34:56.353
Where will you go?

34:56.908 --> 34:58.112
Far away.

34:59.044 --> 35:00.496
Fresh start somewhere.

35:01.913 --> 35:03.496
Be careful, okay?

35:04.249 --> 35:06.121
You know, I probably
should have left years ago,

35:07.018 --> 35:08.321
right after it happened,

35:09.120 --> 35:10.425
after he killed her.

35:13.525 --> 35:14.816
I thought your mother...

35:16.695 --> 35:18.059
I thought she killed herself.

35:19.187 --> 35:20.202
Same thing.

35:21.466 --> 35:22.960
He destroys people.

35:24.436 --> 35:26.273
Terence also builds people up.

35:26.705 --> 35:28.378
He's not a bad guy deep down.

35:31.643 --> 35:33.393
Whatever you have to tell yourself.

36:03.141 --> 36:04.284
Megan?

36:07.779 --> 36:08.848
Hey.

36:15.186 --> 36:16.728
Megan, what is it?

36:22.294 --> 36:23.593
What's going on?

36:23.595 --> 36:25.185
Aaron and Julie are gone.

36:25.897 --> 36:27.063
What do you mean?

36:30.568 --> 36:32.368
Oh, shit. Terence.

36:32.370 --> 36:33.936
Wait, you don't think that I...

36:34.272 --> 36:35.838
I swear to you, I didn't
tell him anything...

36:35.840 --> 36:37.399
"I choose you."

36:39.311 --> 36:41.672
When you said that to me, it was, like,

36:42.347 --> 36:44.152
everything I wanted to hear.

36:44.482 --> 36:47.216
- And that is so weak...
- Megan.

36:47.218 --> 36:49.385
And pathetic that I would actually think

36:49.387 --> 36:50.653
that you would choose me over him.

36:50.655 --> 36:52.288
Look, you cannot leave right now, okay?

36:52.290 --> 36:53.957
Did you ever... ever do
that? Did you ever choose me?

36:53.959 --> 36:55.058
Of course.

36:55.060 --> 36:56.592
Or were you playing me all along?

36:56.594 --> 36:58.188
- Come on, Megan.
- Or did Terence turn you back?

36:58.213 --> 36:59.295
- Will you please...
- No, tell me, what was it?

36:59.297 --> 37:00.363
Was it the toast?

37:00.365 --> 37:01.831
I'm not lying about this.

37:02.096 --> 37:05.234
Aaron, Lisbeth, the
reason for the contract...

37:05.236 --> 37:07.208
You told me it was me.

37:07.839 --> 37:09.872
You lie. That's who you are.

37:09.874 --> 37:10.841
Me?

37:10.841 --> 37:12.347
You've been lying to me for months.

37:12.372 --> 37:14.978
Wow, accusing the accuser.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.840
That is exactly what
an innocent person does.

37:16.865 --> 37:19.065
You're the one that's been
sneaking around behind my back

37:19.067 --> 37:20.233
and trying to take down IHM.

37:20.235 --> 37:21.656
Yeah, your precious IHM.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.202
No, you lied to me about your stepbrother,

37:23.204 --> 37:24.501
and I forgave you,

37:24.501 --> 37:26.140
and I still trusted you after that.

37:26.804 --> 37:29.956
After you had Terence
throw a bag over my head!

37:30.441 --> 37:32.604
Look, Megan, we have to talk about this.

37:32.844 --> 37:34.644
We're getting married tomorrow!

37:35.580 --> 37:37.613
Tell me what I can do to fix this.

37:40.118 --> 37:41.236
You can't.

37:57.890 --> 37:59.812
Scotch, perfect.

38:03.128 --> 38:04.579
You're in high spirits.

38:07.333 --> 38:09.344
Looks I'm gonna be able
to fix things with Kyle.

38:10.268 --> 38:11.278
Really?

38:12.170 --> 38:13.149
Really.

38:15.206 --> 38:16.724
It benefits both of us.

38:21.412 --> 38:22.461
I know.

38:24.115 --> 38:25.252
What is it, then?

38:28.594 --> 38:30.922
I just dropped Wes off at rehab.

38:34.148 --> 38:35.347
What happened?

38:36.094 --> 38:37.450
He got fired

38:37.762 --> 38:38.762
off that job.

38:39.097 --> 38:40.263
DeAnn.

38:40.265 --> 38:41.251
I know.

38:47.699 --> 38:49.065
You were right.

38:52.644 --> 38:54.284
But I wanted to win,

38:56.646 --> 38:59.938
so I let my emotions get
in the way of my instincts.

39:00.689 --> 39:02.274
It's not the first time.

39:03.755 --> 39:05.059
What does that mean?

39:05.723 --> 39:07.233
You pushed for Megan.

39:13.231 --> 39:15.358
We're gonna have to figure
out what to do about her.

39:16.451 --> 39:19.615
Our current dynamic, it's not sustainable.

39:20.505 --> 39:22.094
What did you have in mind?

39:24.709 --> 39:27.087
I think we're gonna need
a more permanent solution.

39:41.659 --> 39:44.026
<i>Hi, it's Megan. Leave a message.</i>

39:53.738 --> 39:55.037
It's over.

39:55.039 --> 39:56.302
Over?

39:56.356 --> 39:58.174
Wait, what's over?

39:58.587 --> 40:00.333
Kyle turned on us,

40:01.212 --> 40:02.643
like you told me he would.

40:03.232 --> 40:04.547
What happened?

40:04.549 --> 40:07.550
Terence has them... Aaron and Julie.

40:07.552 --> 40:08.720
And who knows, they could...

40:09.077 --> 40:10.460
<i>They could be dead.</i>

40:10.460 --> 40:12.260
Wait, no, no, Kyle
wouldn't let that happen.

40:12.262 --> 40:14.062
Yeah, who knows what Kyle would do?

40:15.098 --> 40:16.218
Hold on.

40:18.268 --> 40:21.071
_

40:24.307 --> 40:25.516
<i>Okay.</i>

40:25.909 --> 40:27.716
Where are you right now?

40:28.662 --> 40:30.512
I just left the house.

40:30.514 --> 40:32.106
I needed to get out,

40:32.946 --> 40:34.164
to escape.

40:34.829 --> 40:37.287
Well, I'm here if you need me.

40:38.498 --> 40:40.019
And I'm so sorry.

40:40.323 --> 40:41.553
I know.

40:42.659 --> 40:43.821
Thank you.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.858
<i>Hello?</i>

41:16.860 --> 41:18.626
Hey, it's Megan.

41:31.181 --> 41:32.259
Hey.

41:33.403 --> 41:34.646
You okay?

41:36.356 --> 41:37.507
No.
