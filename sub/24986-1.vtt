01:25.308 --> 01:26.973
What was that?

01:26.975 --> 01:27.973
That wasn't you?

01:27.975 --> 01:30.140
No, I don't growl, asshole.

01:30.142 --> 01:31.140
Go check it out.

01:31.142 --> 01:33.440
It came from over there.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.506
Hey, whatever
happened to women's lib?

01:43.508 --> 01:46.675
Keep walking while
you're squawking.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.440
Yeah, babe,
there's nothing here.

01:50.442 --> 01:53.673
Keep looking,
Captain Chivalry.

01:53.675 --> 01:54.875
Nothing here.

01:57.442 --> 02:00.573
Ooh, shake that moneymaker.

02:00.575 --> 02:02.440
Oh, you like that, huh?

02:03.908 --> 02:07.140
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

02:07.142 --> 02:08.473
Yeah, we're fine.

02:09.942 --> 02:10.842
Oh my gosh!

02:12.208 --> 02:13.042
What?

02:16.442 --> 02:18.440
Keep running!

02:25.642 --> 02:28.273
The last time I used
it, I never missed.

02:28.275 --> 02:30.840
And I wasn't tired at all.

02:30.842 --> 02:33.508
After all, the most important...

02:34.642 --> 02:35.640
Look who's here!

02:35.642 --> 02:36.640
Burt!

02:36.642 --> 02:37.773
Hi, Dana.

02:37.775 --> 02:39.973
Oh, what a surprise!

02:39.975 --> 02:42.573
You haven't changed a bit.

02:42.575 --> 02:43.906
You're as handsome as ever.

02:43.908 --> 02:45.873
And you're looking lovely.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.873
Take your hands off that girl

02:47.875 --> 02:50.440
or you're a dead man.

02:50.442 --> 02:51.840
Robert, how's everything?

02:51.842 --> 02:53.106
Great, how are you?

02:53.108 --> 02:54.340
Better keep an eye
on your sister, buddy.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.740
She's no little girl anymore.

02:55.742 --> 02:56.940
Oh, stop teasing me.

02:56.942 --> 02:58.940
I can look after myself.

02:58.942 --> 03:00.873
Tomorrow I'm hunting big game.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.906
What animal are you hunting?

03:02.908 --> 03:04.773
- Sacred monkeys.
- Oh?

03:04.775 --> 03:06.140
I never heard of them.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.140
What are they?

03:07.142 --> 03:09.040
It's an old native legend.

03:09.042 --> 03:11.440
There're supposed to be some
kind of sacred wild monkey,

03:11.442 --> 03:13.073
somewhere out there.

03:13.075 --> 03:15.473
It stays in the forbidden
part of the jungle,

03:15.475 --> 03:17.442
forbidden to white men.

03:18.308 --> 03:20.440
But you will take me, Robert.

03:20.442 --> 03:22.973
I mean, you promised
to let me come along,

03:22.975 --> 03:26.006
as long as Dad doesn't
find out where we're going.

03:26.008 --> 03:28.440
He made me swear never to go
near that part of the jungle.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.606
Is that the way
you keep your word?

03:29.608 --> 03:31.040
I had my
fingers crossed.

03:31.042 --> 03:31.875
Burt.

03:35.508 --> 03:37.606
Why don't you come with us?

03:37.608 --> 03:39.706
It'll be a hell of a lot of fun.

03:39.708 --> 03:40.740
No thanks.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.575
Firearms make me sick.

03:44.242 --> 03:45.573
You've changed,
like everything else,

03:45.575 --> 03:47.473
including Dad's place.

03:47.475 --> 03:48.873
You mean there's nobody around

03:48.875 --> 03:50.473
who can begin
brawling like I did?

03:50.475 --> 03:51.540
It's very serious now,

03:51.542 --> 03:53.975
ever since you soldiers left.

03:55.142 --> 03:58.740
Have any of the old
bunch been around here?

04:19.908 --> 04:21.505
That's when
you both ran off?

04:21.507 --> 04:22.906
Yep.

04:22.908 --> 04:26.073
You say you got a
good look at our perp?

04:26.075 --> 04:28.440
Well, I mean, Heather did.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.940
I was, I was basically like...

04:30.942 --> 04:32.275
I mean, sort of.

04:33.775 --> 04:36.273
Well, Joe was too busy
shoving me out the way,

04:36.275 --> 04:38.773
so neither of us got
a good glance at him.

04:38.775 --> 04:42.440
I was too busy leading
the way, out of danger,

04:42.442 --> 04:44.040
so that you were not hurt.

04:44.042 --> 04:45.773
Yeah, I'm sure
you did, hot shot.

04:45.775 --> 04:48.273
I'm gonna make out a report.

04:48.275 --> 04:50.473
Here, take my card.

04:50.475 --> 04:52.440
If you hear or see anything,

04:52.442 --> 04:53.873
call us right away.

04:53.875 --> 04:57.806
In the meantime, put
some damn clothes on.

04:57.808 --> 05:01.740
Well officer, this
is a nudist colony.

05:01.742 --> 05:03.040
That's right, detective.

05:03.042 --> 05:05.106
Maybe you should take
off your clothes.

05:05.108 --> 05:06.906
Not in this lifetime, sister.

05:06.908 --> 05:09.640
The human body is
sacred and very dirty.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.440
It's a temple for sinners,

05:11.442 --> 05:13.006
unless of course you're married.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.906
Whatever you say, boss.

05:15.908 --> 05:17.075
Oh, damn it!

05:18.642 --> 05:21.475
I left my phone
down in the woods.

05:29.342 --> 05:32.740
Well, Lucia, it looks like
it's just you and me again.

05:32.742 --> 05:33.842
I guess so.

05:38.775 --> 05:40.273
He took me

05:40.275 --> 05:44.440
to what Indians called the
Land of Petrified Wood.

05:44.442 --> 05:49.173
There, carved in rock were
drawings of a creature

05:49.175 --> 05:51.508
with big hands and big feet,

05:52.842 --> 05:56.208
exactly as I had heard
Bigfoot described.

05:57.075 --> 05:59.808
The drawings were 700 years old.

06:02.342 --> 06:05.740
They told how creatures the
Indians called stick men

06:05.742 --> 06:10.573
had come in the night and
stolen the Indian children.

06:10.575 --> 06:14.075
The Indians abandoned
the village in fear.

06:27.308 --> 06:30.273
My head was reeling
with Bigfoot.

06:30.275 --> 06:33.273
I came to bring my
wonderful husband lunch.

06:33.275 --> 06:35.106
How was your day?

06:35.108 --> 06:36.440
Well, it was going good

06:36.442 --> 06:37.573
until I got called out

06:37.575 --> 06:39.573
to the Circle Double-D's
nudist colony.

06:39.575 --> 06:41.873
A creature of some sort
came out of the woods

06:41.875 --> 06:44.440
and attacked a young couple.

06:44.442 --> 06:46.106
This is really baffling.

06:46.108 --> 06:47.706
Was this some sort of Yeti?

06:47.708 --> 06:50.306
And if so, why was
it attacking people?

06:50.308 --> 06:54.273
Are there really
nude people out there?

06:54.275 --> 06:57.106
As far as the eyes
could see, my love.

06:57.108 --> 06:58.740
Oh my.

06:58.742 --> 06:59.575
I mean...

07:01.208 --> 07:04.740
It's against my better
judgment, but pack your bags.

07:04.742 --> 07:06.840
We're gonna go up there
and find out firsthand

07:06.842 --> 07:08.573
if this thing exists.

07:08.575 --> 07:10.573
We're going to the Double-D?

07:10.575 --> 07:14.573
Yes, but we won't
take off our clothes.

07:14.575 --> 07:17.906
But honey, it's
a nudist colony.

07:17.908 --> 07:19.206
Well alright, Mary,

07:19.208 --> 07:22.540
but we can't enjoy
it, understand?

07:22.542 --> 07:23.542
I promise.

07:26.308 --> 07:28.040
To those who cried,

07:28.042 --> 07:29.906
"For Bigfoot to
exist goes against

07:29.908 --> 07:33.440
"every bit of scientific
data known to man,"

07:33.442 --> 07:37.575
I could now say, "How much
more there is to know."

07:42.642 --> 07:45.240
I felt close to the adventurers

07:45.242 --> 07:48.140
who'd left their calling
cards at Watson Lake

07:48.142 --> 07:50.106
as they crossed into the Yukon,

07:50.108 --> 07:51.640
and even closer to those

07:51.642 --> 07:56.040
who'd made a similar journey
at the turn of the century.

07:56.042 --> 08:00.273
With so many pouring into the
Yukon during the Gold Rush,

08:00.275 --> 08:03.573
it's no surprise there'd
be such a rich source

08:03.575 --> 08:05.675
of stories about Bigfoot.

08:08.442 --> 08:12.273
They were bright, and
traveling was good.

08:12.275 --> 08:14.873
Then, the snow turned red.

08:18.442 --> 08:21.440
To the north, south,
east, and west,

08:21.442 --> 08:24.440
rivers of blood
flowed across the sky

08:24.442 --> 08:26.442
and down into the snows.

08:27.542 --> 08:31.840
It seemed to be the
last day of the world.

08:31.842 --> 08:35.908
Bigfoot was punishing us
for bringing its sorrow.

08:39.342 --> 08:44.240
But then, the good white
light rose from the north.

08:44.241 --> 08:48.008
What followed was a
battle of 1,000 warriors.

08:50.442 --> 08:54.206
White light was the
spirit of Bigfoot,

08:54.208 --> 08:56.442
left to die by the trapper.

08:57.675 --> 09:01.440
It'd returned in the
form of a white raven,

09:01.442 --> 09:03.440
to protect us from the red wrath

09:03.442 --> 09:06.273
of its grieving brothers.

09:06.275 --> 09:09.973
If you travel the
river, you may see him.

09:09.975 --> 09:13.142
And if you do, he
will bring you luck.

09:42.975 --> 09:44.808
Ahem, Earth to Mary.

09:46.108 --> 09:47.073
Sorry.

09:47.075 --> 09:48.740
Where were we?

09:48.742 --> 09:51.606
You were just undressing
that guy with your eyes.

09:51.608 --> 09:53.442
Well, not necessary.

09:58.708 --> 09:59.542
Wow.

10:02.542 --> 10:05.206
Yeah, actually, we should
take our clothes off.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.173
Oh, I don't know, Mary.

10:07.175 --> 10:09.008
It just doesn't seem...

10:13.008 --> 10:15.873
Hi, welcome to the Circle
Double-D nudist colony.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.240
May I help you with
your belongings?

10:17.242 --> 10:19.673
You won't be needing them.

10:22.175 --> 10:23.340
You're welcome.

10:23.342 --> 10:24.675
I live to serve.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.575
I'll remember that.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.740
Hey, you're blocking my view.

10:37.742 --> 10:38.675
Let's go.

11:05.975 --> 11:06.973
It's great.

11:06.975 --> 11:08.973
It sure is.

11:08.975 --> 11:09.808
Oh look.

11:17.908 --> 11:20.306
Well, I'm glad we're
not hunting elephants.

11:20.308 --> 11:22.173
I'll bet you are.

11:22.175 --> 11:23.575
Next time, maybe.

11:28.942 --> 11:30.940
It's so exciting.

11:36.475 --> 11:38.106
You know, I can hardly
wait to find out

11:38.108 --> 11:40.206
if there really is
a sacred monkey.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.173
I already told
you, it's a legend.

11:42.175 --> 11:43.608
Just one of many.

11:45.042 --> 11:49.140
Anyhow, I think we'd better
stay on the beaten path.

11:49.142 --> 11:52.440
Oh, do you really
think there's any danger?

11:52.442 --> 11:54.606
Of course not, but
that's beside the point.

11:54.608 --> 11:58.506
The truth is, there's no
sense in driving all that way

11:58.508 --> 12:00.206
just to shoot at a legend.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.673
You're awful, Robert.

12:01.675 --> 12:05.040
Shooting ordinary game
isn't any fun at all.

12:05.042 --> 12:08.975
I mean, everyone loves
doing something unusual.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.708
Look, a pair of lions!

12:14.442 --> 12:17.873
They didn't even
condescend to look at us.

12:53.342 --> 12:57.206
There was a
statue carved in redwood.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.940
Its image was based on
hundreds of sightings

12:59.942 --> 13:02.740
collected over the years.

13:02.742 --> 13:06.908
And it was exactly like the
creature I had seen myself.

13:22.342 --> 13:23.508
Oh, darling.

13:24.908 --> 13:27.473
I was scoping out that
path leading to the woods.

13:27.475 --> 13:30.306
I think I'm gonna follow
it and see where it goes.

13:30.308 --> 13:32.975
Oh yeah, I'll try one, thanks.

13:34.242 --> 13:35.706
Try one?

13:35.708 --> 13:37.740
What are you talking about?

13:37.742 --> 13:41.908
Um, well, if I get cold
I'll just put a coat on.

13:43.108 --> 13:44.773
I think the sun
is getting to you.

13:44.775 --> 13:46.606
You're not making
any sense, Mary.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.042
Okay, I see you'll be fine.

13:50.275 --> 13:51.873
Where were we?

13:51.875 --> 13:53.973
Well, I was telling
you about the time

13:53.975 --> 13:55.840
that I saw the monster.

13:55.842 --> 13:56.675
Right.

13:58.842 --> 14:00.673
But I think she was talking

14:00.675 --> 14:02.973
about Mike the maintenance guy.

14:02.975 --> 14:06.840
Ooh, I've got my
own monster story.

14:06.842 --> 14:09.242
Mike was way deep in my unit.

14:10.342 --> 14:12.240
In your unit, you say?

14:12.242 --> 14:13.473
Really?

14:13.475 --> 14:16.075
Way, way deep,
if you must know.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.740
Well, if it's the guy I
saw in the office today,

14:19.742 --> 14:22.540
then he's definitely the
right guy for the job.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.142
I saw about that.

14:26.342 --> 14:28.506
Hi, Mike.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.440
Should've taken a dip with us.

14:37.442 --> 14:38.540
Oh, I would have.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.840
But you see, I
couldn't leave the bar.

14:40.842 --> 14:42.206
Besides, it looks like you girls

14:42.208 --> 14:43.540
got on just fine without me.

14:43.542 --> 14:44.540
Bye, babe.

14:44.542 --> 14:46.940
We'll see you later.

14:46.942 --> 14:49.040
Are you thirsty?

14:49.042 --> 14:51.640
That's somebody else's drink.

14:51.642 --> 14:53.573
Yeah, but I poured it.

14:53.575 --> 14:55.740
And it's really more hungry
than thirsty, really.

14:55.742 --> 14:58.206
I haven't eaten breakfast
since 6:30 this morning.

14:58.208 --> 14:59.673
And breakfast wasn't
really that big,

14:59.675 --> 15:00.840
when you think about it.

15:00.842 --> 15:02.440
I mean, I'm a growing boy.

15:02.442 --> 15:05.306
And French toast, a
little creme fraiche,

15:05.308 --> 15:07.006
and some pastries, of course.

15:07.008 --> 15:08.873
And then, you know, you
got a little fruit platter.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.340
Coffee was good, but it really
wasn't a latte of any kind.

15:11.342 --> 15:13.240
It was just a
small black coffee.

15:13.242 --> 15:15.140
And then the tater
tots were nice,

15:15.142 --> 15:17.740
and eggs, but not scrambled.

15:17.742 --> 15:18.740
A little bit of cheese...

15:18.742 --> 15:21.606
Don't you ever shut up?

15:21.608 --> 15:24.342
I'm totally coming
onto you here.

15:43.975 --> 15:44.973
Look at that.

15:44.975 --> 15:47.173
Shotguns are loaded.

16:00.175 --> 16:01.740
Crocodile, how about it?

16:01.742 --> 16:04.075
Let's see what you can do.

16:09.475 --> 16:11.340
Gotta hit the eye.

16:11.342 --> 16:13.242
Better luck next time.

16:21.908 --> 16:25.242
I wish that it was
me in there swimming.

18:31.075 --> 18:31.975
Good God.

18:33.142 --> 18:34.873
Help me, please.

18:34.875 --> 18:37.708
We've gotta get
you out of here.

18:42.075 --> 18:43.540
No, no, no.

18:43.542 --> 18:44.442
Let's go.

19:33.675 --> 19:34.673
Put me down.

19:34.675 --> 19:35.508
No.

19:40.442 --> 19:42.740
You'll never get away with this.

19:48.242 --> 19:49.842
What are you doing?

19:51.275 --> 19:53.942
Are you trying to make me dance?

19:55.442 --> 19:58.973
Well, why didn't you just
say that, you big oaf?

20:40.542 --> 20:44.442
It happened
two million years ago.

20:50.142 --> 20:53.742
In steaming swamps and
prehistoric jungles.

21:00.075 --> 21:04.008
The earliest manlike
creature walked the Earth.

21:05.608 --> 21:08.208
Not human, more beast than man.

21:11.842 --> 21:14.440
A monster of evolution.

21:24.175 --> 21:27.706
It walked across
the eons of time,

21:27.708 --> 21:31.542
slowly changing, becoming
more and more human,

21:35.175 --> 21:37.108
more and more advanced.

21:38.275 --> 21:39.940
These initial
discoveries were made

21:39.942 --> 21:42.906
mostly in the snowbound
regions of the world,

21:42.908 --> 21:45.340
parts of Alaska, Canada,

21:45.342 --> 21:49.508
most often by mountaineering
expeditions in the Himalayas.

22:08.142 --> 22:11.440
Now, this man was a
professional photographer,

22:11.442 --> 22:14.440
as well as an educated
scientific investigator

22:14.442 --> 22:15.708
and mountaineer.

22:16.942 --> 22:19.106
The giant footprints
in the snow,

22:19.108 --> 22:20.740
photographed by Stapleton,

22:20.742 --> 22:24.873
were published by
newspapers around the world.

22:24.875 --> 22:27.806
For the first time,
the public came to know

22:27.808 --> 22:31.306
of the existence of a
giant, manlike monster

22:31.308 --> 22:35.173
which actually exists
in the Himalayas.

22:35.175 --> 22:38.075
A monster known as
Yeti or Bigfoot.

22:42.442 --> 22:45.940
Within two years, the
reports of giant footprints

22:45.942 --> 22:48.773
deep within the wilderness
areas of the world

22:48.775 --> 22:52.942
spread from the Himalayas
into North American itself.

22:57.975 --> 22:59.773
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

22:59.775 --> 23:02.506
Oh no, no, it's
completely my fault.

23:02.508 --> 23:03.840
I'm such a klutz.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.540
You are not a klutz.

23:05.542 --> 23:08.540
If anything, you're an
amazingly beautiful woman.

23:08.542 --> 23:10.806
That is what you are.

23:10.808 --> 23:11.806
I am?

23:11.808 --> 23:13.340
Yes, you are.

23:13.342 --> 23:14.508
And in fact...

23:16.242 --> 23:18.206
If you'll follow
me to the boudoir,

23:18.208 --> 23:20.073
I'd be happy to show
you just how, um,

23:20.075 --> 23:22.173
amazingly beautiful you are.

23:22.175 --> 23:24.240
I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

23:24.242 --> 23:25.075
I mean...

25:06.342 --> 25:10.306
Wow, I forget how
beautiful it is up here.

25:10.308 --> 25:12.206
You know, Bon?

25:12.208 --> 25:14.140
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

25:14.142 --> 25:16.073
but it is a pretty cool place.

25:16.075 --> 25:17.306
Yeah.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.540
My parents used
to take me up here

25:18.542 --> 25:19.973
while I was at State.

25:19.975 --> 25:21.706
I used to hate it back then

25:21.708 --> 25:22.973
because it meant
I had to be away

25:22.975 --> 25:25.540
from Danny Jackson
for five weeks.

25:25.542 --> 25:27.440
Ooh, I screwed Danny...

25:27.442 --> 25:28.442
I mean, who?

25:30.042 --> 25:32.906
You know, he was
president of his fraternity.

25:32.908 --> 25:35.540
He sat next to you in sociology?

25:35.542 --> 25:37.540
Sorry, not ringing a bell.

25:37.542 --> 25:38.708
Yeah, right.

25:39.608 --> 25:41.706
Okay, well, what can I say?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.440
You were gone for the summer,

25:43.442 --> 25:45.240
and we were at a party.

25:45.242 --> 25:48.573
And as they say,
the rest is history.

25:48.575 --> 25:50.640
I can't believe you did that.

25:50.642 --> 25:51.840
What?

25:51.842 --> 25:54.240
It was like 100 years
ago, so who cares?

25:54.242 --> 25:57.006
Anyways, what about
Bobby Lockhart?

25:57.008 --> 25:58.440
Who?

25:58.442 --> 26:00.940
Oh, don't play dumb with me.

26:00.942 --> 26:03.473
Yeah, that was awkward.

26:03.475 --> 26:06.740
Well, let's face it,
we both made mistakes.

26:06.742 --> 26:07.773
I agree.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.175
We're both a couple of sluts.

26:11.108 --> 26:11.942
Yeah.

26:36.508 --> 26:38.773
Oh my god, what was that?

26:38.775 --> 26:40.540
I think I just saw something.

26:40.542 --> 26:42.442
Let's get out of here.

26:53.608 --> 26:55.806
Well, I
was out of patience

26:55.808 --> 26:57.440
and I was out of money.

26:57.442 --> 26:59.440
So I took a job up
in the wilderness,

26:59.442 --> 27:01.440
around Bossburg, Washington.

27:01.442 --> 27:05.542
Had to photograph a cinnamon
bear in its natural habitat.

27:06.608 --> 27:07.606
You want a bear?

27:07.608 --> 27:09.473
Here's a bear.

27:09.475 --> 27:10.642
Piece of cake.

27:11.808 --> 27:14.606
I always got what I set after...

27:14.608 --> 27:15.842
Except Bigfoot.

27:19.508 --> 27:20.675
Then I saw it,

27:22.108 --> 27:26.673
a deformed version of the
track I'd seen so often.

27:33.342 --> 27:34.442
There it was.

27:35.642 --> 27:38.575
Finally, face-to-face
with Bigfoot.

27:45.442 --> 27:49.608
Here was the domed head, just
as others had described it.

27:51.042 --> 27:54.640
The thick, dark fur to protect
it from extremes of weather,

27:54.642 --> 27:58.442
and allow it to pass
unnoticed in the night.

28:00.175 --> 28:02.342
I saw it, photographed it,

28:03.508 --> 28:06.342
but scientists
challenged my film.

28:08.975 --> 28:12.742
Yet it stood up under
every conceivable test.

28:13.808 --> 28:15.473
Some reveal rugged terrain

28:15.475 --> 28:17.640
as the cause of
the skinned heels,

28:17.642 --> 28:20.208
polio as the cause of the limp.

28:21.442 --> 28:23.140
But my documented evidence

28:23.142 --> 28:26.075
wasn't good enough
for the experts,

28:28.575 --> 28:31.073
expects who still asked,

28:31.075 --> 28:33.973
"How could such a
creature survive?

28:33.975 --> 28:35.073
"Where does it live?

28:35.075 --> 28:36.740
"Show us its remains.

28:36.742 --> 28:38.440
"What does it eat?"

28:38.442 --> 28:41.006
Experts who challenged my word

28:41.008 --> 28:43.306
but claimed credit for my film,

28:43.308 --> 28:46.542
and profited by it
on lecture circuits.

28:48.708 --> 28:51.608
Now I didn't care
for these people,

28:55.242 --> 28:58.442
but I was haunted
by their questions.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.740
Where am I?

29:04.742 --> 29:05.706
You're at Double-D.

29:05.708 --> 29:07.540
You're safe now.

29:07.542 --> 29:08.808
You saved me?

29:10.342 --> 29:12.106
Anyway, we need
to get going, okay?

29:12.108 --> 29:13.340
Wait, where's Tina?

29:13.342 --> 29:14.173
Who?

29:14.175 --> 29:15.106
My friend.

29:15.108 --> 29:15.940
I came with my friend Tina.

29:15.942 --> 29:17.006
Where is she?

29:17.008 --> 29:18.206
I don't know.

29:18.208 --> 29:19.173
You were the only
person when I got here,

29:19.175 --> 29:20.175
so I mean...

29:21.675 --> 29:24.206
Oh my God, the monster.

29:24.208 --> 29:25.440
What monster?

29:25.442 --> 29:28.640
No, we need to get
out of here right now.

30:03.908 --> 30:05.073
How are you feeling?

30:05.075 --> 30:06.706
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:06.708 --> 30:08.108
I didn't see you.

30:09.042 --> 30:11.273
You didn't see me, Miss Dana?

30:11.275 --> 30:12.108
Uh, no?

30:14.942 --> 30:15.775
Really?

30:17.575 --> 30:18.408
Well...

30:19.775 --> 30:21.575
I think maybe you did.

30:24.842 --> 30:26.506
I didn't see anything.

30:26.508 --> 30:29.473
I think we're in
the clear, for now.

30:29.475 --> 30:30.973
- Are we?
- Yeah.

30:30.975 --> 30:34.273
Then why don't
you lean a little closer?

30:38.675 --> 30:40.006
Now I understood

30:40.008 --> 30:42.742
why Bigfoot steered
clear of man.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.506
He had to,

30:45.508 --> 30:47.175
in order to survive.

30:52.375 --> 30:55.306
However vicious the
creature might be,

30:55.308 --> 30:59.240
I gained a lot of respect
for the elusive Bigfoot

30:59.242 --> 31:01.442
and its ability to endure.

31:03.108 --> 31:04.773
But if we were to find it,

31:04.775 --> 31:08.942
we'd have to get to the furthest
outpost of civilization.

31:14.042 --> 31:15.773
When we ran out of road,

31:15.775 --> 31:19.740
we saw the remnants
of the old pioneers

31:19.742 --> 31:22.908
giving way to the
machinery of the new.

31:24.308 --> 31:27.942
Thousands were now pouring
back up to the new gold rush.

31:36.042 --> 31:37.706
There's something moving.

31:37.708 --> 31:39.208
Oh, it's a python.

31:46.508 --> 31:47.675
Don't kill it.

32:44.075 --> 32:45.642
Please let me go.

32:53.642 --> 32:55.142
Are you alright?

32:56.342 --> 32:58.073
I think so.

32:58.075 --> 32:59.706
He grabbed me by the pool.

32:59.708 --> 33:01.506
What does he want?

33:01.508 --> 33:04.573
He wants us to do
a pole dance for him.

33:04.575 --> 33:06.508
Keep dreaming, buddy.

33:07.675 --> 33:09.006
You're forgetting,

33:09.008 --> 33:12.073
we are tied up to a pole here.

33:12.075 --> 33:15.606
Well, I don't see
dollar bills anywhere.

33:15.608 --> 33:17.173
Dollar bills?

33:17.175 --> 33:19.240
I was thinking for twenties.

33:19.242 --> 33:20.806
When you get right
down to it, though,

33:20.808 --> 33:22.473
it's actually kind of fun.

33:22.475 --> 33:24.475
- Really?
- Yeah, watch.

33:52.942 --> 33:54.140
Ah, excellent.

33:54.142 --> 33:55.473
One of our visitors.

33:55.475 --> 33:57.106
The sacred monkey, no less,

33:57.108 --> 33:59.606
captured by one of her sons.

34:04.242 --> 34:05.075
Come out.

34:11.208 --> 34:12.906
Look, they're gonna obey you.

34:12.908 --> 34:15.172
Now they only take
orders from me.

34:15.175 --> 34:16.007
You see?

34:17.442 --> 34:21.239
You'll find out, they won't
listen to you anymore.

34:21.242 --> 34:24.542
Soon you, too, will
obey when I command.

34:30.875 --> 34:31.708
Malek.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.072
First, I see you
got away from Turk.

34:39.074 --> 34:42.005
Listen Burt, you'll have to do

34:42.007 --> 34:44.505
what I tell you to do for once.

34:44.507 --> 34:46.306
I've been hunting the
sacred monkey for a year,

34:46.308 --> 34:49.242
and I don't intend
to lose her now.

34:51.608 --> 34:52.806
When I want something,

34:52.808 --> 34:54.672
I take it and I keep it forever.

34:56.442 --> 34:58.475
Not this time, Albert.

35:04.308 --> 35:07.073
This time you've
finally lost the game.

35:07.075 --> 35:09.073
You're really punctual, Burt.

35:09.075 --> 35:11.740
You're never late
for an appointment.

35:11.742 --> 35:14.306
You arrive within
the 10 minutes.

35:14.308 --> 35:16.240
Fast work, Burt.

35:16.242 --> 35:18.440
But I haven't lost the game yet,

35:18.442 --> 35:20.442
as you'll soon find out.

35:21.508 --> 35:24.140
- Look out, Burt.
- What do you mean?

35:24.142 --> 35:25.773
The animatronic brain.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.640
Shoot the light on the panel!

35:27.642 --> 35:29.142
Malek, hold him!

35:30.975 --> 35:33.440
Burt, shoot the light.

36:03.608 --> 36:04.942
What was that?

37:01.442 --> 37:02.773
Stay back.

37:02.775 --> 37:04.442
No, come untie us.

37:07.108 --> 37:09.640
What's going on here?

37:09.642 --> 37:10.973
I don't know.

37:10.975 --> 37:13.173
All I know is every
time I hear music

37:13.175 --> 37:15.540
and chicks do pole
dances for me,

37:15.542 --> 37:17.042
I feel very human.

37:18.542 --> 37:19.873
Oh really?

37:19.875 --> 37:21.006
What's your name?

37:21.008 --> 37:22.573
Jonah Trout.

37:22.575 --> 37:25.306
Not from the Trout family?

37:25.308 --> 37:26.906
That's right.

37:26.908 --> 37:28.440
I heard you were dead.

37:28.442 --> 37:29.906
Well, it's been so
long since I got laid,

37:29.908 --> 37:31.342
I may as well be.

37:32.742 --> 37:36.442
Sounds to me as if that
curse has been lifted.

37:38.808 --> 37:41.973
You know, I
think you're right.

37:41.975 --> 37:45.273
Then, a
movement in the woods.

37:45.275 --> 37:47.440
The sun hadn't come up yet.

37:47.442 --> 37:51.106
It was hard to make out
what I'd seen at first.

38:05.642 --> 38:07.475
There he was, Bigfoot,

38:09.342 --> 38:13.175
standing no more than
100 yards from my blind.

38:14.275 --> 38:16.840
I began to shake all over.

38:16.842 --> 38:20.440
I could barely keep
hold of my camera.

38:20.442 --> 38:21.608
He was awesome.

38:33.075 --> 38:35.475
Then, behind me, another one,

38:36.875 --> 38:39.042
smaller, possibly younger.

38:40.242 --> 38:42.575
How many of them were there?

38:43.642 --> 38:45.075
Was I surrounded?

38:48.508 --> 38:52.675
They were the most extraordinary
creatures I'd ever seen.

38:53.808 --> 38:56.806
I now knew why the
Eskimos called Bigfoot

38:56.808 --> 38:58.875
the king of the animals.

39:00.775 --> 39:04.173
The older, larger one
was seven feet tall,

39:04.175 --> 39:05.675
450 to 500 pounds,

39:07.542 --> 39:10.106
his domed head and
long, dark hair

39:10.108 --> 39:14.173
just like the other
creatures I'd seen.

39:14.175 --> 39:16.306
His odor was overwhelming,

39:16.308 --> 39:18.640
the same thick, musky scent

39:18.642 --> 39:21.975
that first led me to
Bigfoot so long ago.

39:24.642 --> 39:28.306
The young one was no more than
five-and-a-half feet tall,

39:28.308 --> 39:29.208
250 pounds.

39:31.008 --> 39:34.440
If my guess was right,
probably on its first trip

39:34.442 --> 39:37.940
away from its northern
breeding grounds.

39:37.942 --> 39:40.973
He'd probably never
seen a man before.

39:40.975 --> 39:44.973
If he saw me, he could
panic and attack.

39:44.975 --> 39:47.475
Here I was again with Bigfoot,

39:48.675 --> 39:52.108
unchallengeable proof
my theory had worked.

39:52.975 --> 39:55.440
It is a migratory animal,

39:55.442 --> 39:59.542
and I now have the documentations
of its habits I needed.

40:02.208 --> 40:05.540
Now we can begin to
understand the place

40:05.542 --> 40:08.042
this creature holds in nature.

40:16.075 --> 40:20.406
I once again said goodbye
to this mysterious creature

40:20.408 --> 40:23.942
that has somehow outlived
its natural role,

40:26.575 --> 40:28.742
endured the tests of time,

40:30.575 --> 40:33.742
now left to wander
the land elusively,

40:34.708 --> 40:37.308
with a strange will to survive.

40:47.408 --> 40:50.740
Oh, I still have
plenty of questions,

40:50.742 --> 40:54.706
and I'll continue my
search for the answers now.

40:54.708 --> 40:56.173
But I assure you,

40:56.175 --> 40:58.440
I'll no longer get so caught up

40:58.442 --> 41:01.440
in the problems of my research

41:01.442 --> 41:05.475
that I'll lose touch with
the wonders it reveals.

41:20.975 --> 41:24.106
Is that you my
prince charming?

41:24.108 --> 41:25.440
You expecting someone else?

41:26.542 --> 41:27.808
Oh no, never.

41:29.608 --> 41:32.073
You look amazing baby.

41:32.075 --> 41:34.106
But can I make one suggestion?

41:34.108 --> 41:34.942
Sure.

41:41.575 --> 41:45.106
I had a feeling that
would be your suggestion.

41:45.108 --> 41:46.806
Can you guess my next one?

41:46.808 --> 41:48.740
Can you guess mine?

42:10.342 --> 42:14.206
Check our coordinates
to base Orion.

42:14.208 --> 42:17.173
Compare figures with
signal direction.

42:17.175 --> 42:20.540
Angle alpha
37, angle alpha 12,

42:20.542 --> 42:23.206
velocity 600 miles per second.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.073
Signal's
in direction course,

42:25.075 --> 42:27.075
power signal's constant.

42:28.508 --> 42:31.040
Exact coordinate
signal, exact direction,

42:31.042 --> 42:32.740
course confirmed.

42:56.675 --> 42:59.506
This is Galactic Explorer 69.

42:59.508 --> 43:01.206
My landing was successful.

43:01.208 --> 43:02.475
Very well 69.

43:03.808 --> 43:06.340
For the sake of the Earthlings
I will call you Serena

43:06.342 --> 43:08.240
while you're on their planet.

43:08.242 --> 43:10.940
As you wish oh
supreme mistress.

43:10.942 --> 43:12.806
May I now learn the
reason of my travels?

43:12.808 --> 43:17.173
Very well, you must preceded
to the nearest populace.

43:17.175 --> 43:19.873
Once there you
have 24 Earth hours

43:19.875 --> 43:23.173
to engage in their sex secrets.

43:23.175 --> 43:27.606
The knowledge that you bring
back to Deltron is imperative.

43:27.608 --> 43:30.506
Without it our civilization
will not survive

43:30.508 --> 43:31.940
another light year.

43:31.942 --> 43:33.775
I do not understand.

43:34.975 --> 43:38.108
Don't stop for the
next 24 Earth hours.

43:40.042 --> 43:41.442
Oh I like that.

43:43.042 --> 43:45.206
This is Serena signing off.

44:39.308 --> 44:40.706
Who are you?

44:40.708 --> 44:43.273
I'm Serena, I come in peace.

44:43.275 --> 44:45.040
Is this some kind of joke?

44:45.042 --> 44:46.440
What is a joke?

44:46.442 --> 44:47.606
It's nothing.

44:47.608 --> 44:49.206
I'm Mark and this
is my friend Cindy.

44:49.208 --> 44:50.442
Your friend?

44:51.508 --> 44:53.440
Nice outfit by the way.

44:53.442 --> 44:54.606
Thank you.

44:54.608 --> 44:56.640
That was a joke.

44:56.642 --> 44:57.975
Another joke?

44:58.842 --> 45:00.473
Do you Earthlings do this a lot?

45:00.475 --> 45:01.673
Yes we do Serena.

45:01.675 --> 45:03.440
So where do you come from?

45:03.442 --> 45:06.806
I come from Deltron, third
planet in the first galaxy.

45:06.808 --> 45:08.940
It is outside your solar system.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.442
Of course it is.

45:12.742 --> 45:14.440
So like what are
you doing here?

45:14.442 --> 45:16.640
I've come to learn
from you Earthlings.

45:16.642 --> 45:20.240
Okay that's it this chick's
crazy I'm calling 911.

45:20.242 --> 45:21.740
Is that another joke?

45:21.742 --> 45:23.806
Hold on let's just play
along it's gonna be fun.

45:23.808 --> 45:27.773
So Serena do you have
any special powers or?

45:27.775 --> 45:29.040
Special powers?

45:29.042 --> 45:32.573
Yeah like can you
make yourself disappear?

45:32.575 --> 45:36.142
Hmm, I cannot do
that, but I can do this.

45:37.208 --> 45:38.873
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

45:38.875 --> 45:41.040
- That's unbelievable.
- That's amazing.

45:41.042 --> 45:43.240
May I begin learning now?

45:43.242 --> 45:45.006
I don't know may she?

45:45.008 --> 45:46.640
Why the hell not? Sure.

45:46.642 --> 45:47.806
Really?

45:47.808 --> 45:48.642
Yeah.

45:50.442 --> 45:53.073
It's a woman's prerogative
to change minds.

45:53.075 --> 45:55.508
That's why I love you babe.

46:02.008 --> 46:05.940
Oh this is an emergency
I must take this.

46:05.942 --> 46:09.442
Oh.

46:20.442 --> 46:23.106
Serena sorry to
keep you waiting,

46:23.108 --> 46:25.440
but my servants were
misbehaving again

46:25.442 --> 46:27.440
and I had to teach
them a lesson.

46:27.442 --> 46:31.340
Oh you're the best teacher
I know supreme mistress.

46:31.342 --> 46:34.240
Too bad it doesn't
result in procreation.

46:34.242 --> 46:36.273
Oh you're so kind.

46:36.275 --> 46:38.173
I just called to report back.

46:38.175 --> 46:41.473
I've engaged the Earthlings
in sexual intercourse

46:41.475 --> 46:44.506
and it seems to be
quite gratifying.

46:44.508 --> 46:47.175
In fact it's extremely exciting.

46:48.575 --> 46:52.240
That's good news Serena and
are you learning anything?

46:52.242 --> 46:56.540
Oh yes I've learned
this thing called joking,

46:56.542 --> 47:00.040
but I haven't quite
figured it out yet.

47:00.042 --> 47:01.873
Is that all you've learned?

47:01.875 --> 47:04.206
I've also learned
that the male species

47:04.208 --> 47:06.206
has something that
greatly resembles

47:06.208 --> 47:08.540
our communication devices.

47:08.542 --> 47:10.840
Do you mean our dildometer?

47:10.842 --> 47:13.842
Yes, only there's
are much larger.

47:15.675 --> 47:17.140
Interesting,

47:17.142 --> 47:19.173
I couldn't imagine why they
would need to be larger.

47:19.175 --> 47:24.073
Until this morning supreme
mistress neither could I.

47:24.075 --> 47:25.706
Well keep up the good work

47:25.708 --> 47:28.440
and get back to me when
you've learned more.

47:28.442 --> 47:30.640
Serena signing off.

47:37.042 --> 47:39.873
What's going on in here?

47:41.108 --> 47:42.206
Oh nothing.

47:42.208 --> 47:43.873
I heard voices.

47:43.875 --> 47:47.240
But it is only I, how
could there be voices?

47:47.242 --> 47:48.973
I don't know.

47:48.975 --> 47:52.340
How did you make the
clothes disappear?

47:52.342 --> 47:55.306
Anyway I need to clean up,

47:55.308 --> 47:56.973
I need to use the shower.

47:56.975 --> 48:00.606
Oh is this clean up
another one of those jokes?

48:00.608 --> 48:02.208
Are you for real?

48:05.042 --> 48:06.808
Yes I believe I am.

48:14.175 --> 48:16.906
Is this liquid used in clean up?

48:16.908 --> 48:18.640
Do you want to find out?

48:18.642 --> 48:19.940
I'll show you.

48:48.275 --> 48:51.306
Range one,
oh, eight, two,

48:51.308 --> 48:53.808
angle of elevation 13 degrees.

48:55.342 --> 48:59.442
Direction alpha, 19
degrees, 10 seconds from now

49:01.208 --> 49:05.442
target reaches coordinates,
minus nine, eight, seven, six...

49:06.708 --> 49:08.006
Guess who.

49:08.008 --> 49:10.508
I don't know give me a hint.

49:11.642 --> 49:15.006
Oh my god Mark you're
driving me crazy.

49:24.808 --> 49:27.106
What are you doing here?

49:27.108 --> 49:28.706
Ted left 10 minutes ago.

49:28.708 --> 49:30.106
I know he's at my place.

49:30.108 --> 49:32.140
I told him I was
gonna get some booze.

49:32.142 --> 49:35.340
- Stop it we can't.
- Are you sure?

49:35.342 --> 49:37.675
- I hate you.
- No you don't.

49:39.442 --> 49:42.608
You're damn right
I don't, come here.

49:54.242 --> 49:55.806
I want to get laid.

49:55.808 --> 49:57.873
I thought you screwed
that bouncer last night?

49:57.875 --> 49:59.940
You know the one
you have a crush on?

49:59.942 --> 50:02.273
I did but that was
like 12 hours ago.

50:02.275 --> 50:05.240
God Jen you are such a slut.

50:05.242 --> 50:06.506
I don't know Tina

50:06.508 --> 50:08.673
I think Jen just has a
really healthy libido.

50:09.608 --> 50:11.240
Oh yeah now you're talking.

50:11.242 --> 50:12.473
Let's call for some pizza.

50:12.475 --> 50:14.740
I'd love to get my hands
on that delivery boy.

50:14.742 --> 50:16.640
Boy being the operative word.

50:16.642 --> 50:18.473
He's like 16 years old.

50:18.475 --> 50:20.506
He's 18, his
birthday was last week,

50:20.508 --> 50:21.940
and I told him that
when he was legal

50:21.942 --> 50:23.206
I had a present for him.

50:23.208 --> 50:26.206
Oh so you're ordering sausage.

50:26.208 --> 50:28.840
You better believe it and
I'm getting some pizza too.

50:32.675 --> 50:34.442
Maybe that's Armando.

50:35.842 --> 50:38.106
His name's Armando.

50:38.108 --> 50:41.040
He sounds hot, I think
we'll all order some sausage.

50:41.042 --> 50:43.475
I gotta get this first guys.

50:44.575 --> 50:46.175
Hello, oh hi Cindy.

50:48.008 --> 50:49.473
Yeah.

50:49.475 --> 50:53.440
That sounds good, I'm just
around the corner in my place.

50:53.442 --> 50:56.040
I'm with Allie and Tina.

50:56.042 --> 50:58.206
Okay, we'll bring
some tequila over

50:58.208 --> 51:00.208
and we'll be there soon.

51:01.342 --> 51:04.606
That was Cindy, she
invited us to her party,

51:04.608 --> 51:06.706
her and Mark's place.

51:06.708 --> 51:07.542
Oh Mark.

51:09.475 --> 51:12.475
I know, speaking of sausage.

51:13.642 --> 51:16.642
Red alert
satellite in sector H

51:16.842 --> 51:18.073
has ceased its function.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.273
Son of a bitch,
she wasn't kidding.

51:20.275 --> 51:24.006
Red alert, satellite
in sector H has ceased...

51:27.875 --> 51:29.673
- Hey ladies.
- Oh.

51:29.675 --> 51:31.773
- Hi.
- Hi sausage,

51:31.775 --> 51:34.640
- I mean Mark.
- I don't get it.

51:34.642 --> 51:36.740
Sorry, Sidney just likes
to talk when she's drunk.

51:36.742 --> 51:39.040
Anyway you're not going to
believe what I just found.

51:39.042 --> 51:40.040
What?

51:40.042 --> 51:41.840
A spaceship.

51:41.842 --> 51:44.173
Have we started
drinking a little early?

51:44.175 --> 51:45.473
I'm serious.

51:45.475 --> 51:46.806
- What?
- I'll show you.

51:46.808 --> 51:47.973
Oh, oh.

51:47.975 --> 51:49.473
It's right over in the field.

51:49.475 --> 51:51.440
The spaceship, his, "hey
you all, the spaceship."

51:51.442 --> 51:52.440
It's the spaceship.

51:52.442 --> 51:54.973
- Oh.
- The spaceship.

51:54.975 --> 51:57.173
We gotta go find a bathroom.

51:57.175 --> 51:59.573
- I'll go, hey I'll go.
- We'll see you later.

51:59.575 --> 52:00.442
I'll go.

52:09.842 --> 52:11.806
See I told you.

52:11.808 --> 52:13.006
That can't be real.

52:13.008 --> 52:14.206
I don't think so.

52:14.208 --> 52:15.740
There's this chick
at our place, Serena,

52:15.742 --> 52:17.673
she was sent from
another planet.

52:17.675 --> 52:19.006
You think I'm crazy don't you?

52:19.008 --> 52:20.473
No.

52:20.475 --> 52:22.873
'Cause it's true,
you'll meet her.

52:22.875 --> 52:24.773
Okay, well I'm a
little disappointed then

52:24.775 --> 52:28.106
because I thought you lured me
here to take advantage of me

52:28.108 --> 52:30.506
and now I see
there's a real ship.

52:30.508 --> 52:31.773
Well I mean the spaceship

52:31.775 --> 52:34.473
was the one thing I
wanted to show you.

52:34.475 --> 52:37.708
Oh really well
let's go check it out.

52:51.942 --> 52:53.906
How did you know
how to get in here?

52:53.908 --> 52:57.873
I just hit the side of
the door and it opened up.

52:57.875 --> 53:02.042
Well, since we're here maybe
we should make the most of it.

53:03.775 --> 53:05.706
I like that idea.

53:16.142 --> 53:16.975
Uh-huh.

53:54.542 --> 53:56.240
- Hi y'all.
- Hola.

53:57.442 --> 53:58.442
Hey girls.

54:00.308 --> 54:02.306
Have you guys seen Tina?

54:02.308 --> 54:04.440
My guess is she's just
finishing up with lunch.

54:04.442 --> 54:06.840
Sausage I believe.

54:06.842 --> 54:08.673
That would be my guess.

54:08.675 --> 54:11.806
Oh well I hope
we see her soon.

54:11.808 --> 54:13.273
That's a good chance.

54:13.275 --> 54:15.275
Chances are excellent.

54:18.108 --> 54:20.140
Cin, introduce
us to your friend.

54:20.142 --> 54:22.673
This is Serena, she's from...

54:22.675 --> 54:26.473
Deltron, the third
planet in the first galaxy.

54:26.475 --> 54:28.440
It's outside our universe.

54:28.442 --> 54:29.773
She's been sent here.

54:29.775 --> 54:30.873
That's nice.

54:30.875 --> 54:32.106
Wow.

54:32.108 --> 54:33.473
Ted did you get in
on any of this action?

54:33.475 --> 54:37.506
Oh yeah, she's unbelievable
and that's no joke.

54:37.508 --> 54:40.440
I really do not
understand this joking.

54:40.442 --> 54:44.542
Oh, that's okay, you're
perfect just the way you are.

54:45.742 --> 54:47.573
Thank you Earthling Ted.

54:48.842 --> 54:50.506
Isn't she adorable, I
mean I'm Earthling Ted,

54:50.508 --> 54:51.640
isn't that great?

54:51.642 --> 54:53.906
Anyway, anyone want a drink?

54:53.908 --> 54:55.706
- No I'm good.
- No thanks.

54:55.708 --> 54:57.442
- No?
- No thank you.

55:02.575 --> 55:05.806
So Cin did you get in
on any of this Ted action?

55:05.808 --> 55:08.708
Yeah we had an
amazing three way.

55:10.242 --> 55:12.673
So what about Ted?

55:12.675 --> 55:16.673
Well if you're asking me
what I think you're asking me

55:16.675 --> 55:19.673
Mark and Ted they're
a lot a like.

55:19.675 --> 55:22.640
Ted is more like
his big brother.

55:22.642 --> 55:24.106
That's all I need to hear.

55:24.108 --> 55:27.140
Hey Ted I think I'll take one
of those drinks after all.

55:35.808 --> 55:36.642
Hey.

55:38.442 --> 55:39.208
Hey.

55:41.675 --> 55:43.473
Did you say you wanted a drink?

55:43.475 --> 55:45.006
Yeah I did, please.

55:45.008 --> 55:46.175
Here you go.

55:49.075 --> 55:51.840
I think you know what
I actually really meant.

55:51.842 --> 55:54.742
Oh, you want,
you wanted a drink.

55:56.242 --> 55:57.075
Yeah.

55:59.308 --> 56:00.473
Oh.

56:00.475 --> 56:02.806
Target
reaches coordinates.

56:02.808 --> 56:04.742
- Three, two, one.
- Fire.

56:24.308 --> 56:26.808
It's trying to get away, fire.

56:30.675 --> 56:34.842
How about that
eh? Yeah.

56:37.508 --> 56:38.342
On target.

56:42.942 --> 56:47.108
Damage to drive section,
reactor water tank empty.

57:07.608 --> 57:10.740
Hey honey look who I ran into.

57:10.742 --> 57:12.440
Right.

57:12.442 --> 57:16.475
Anyway guess what I
found, Serena's space ship.

57:17.675 --> 57:19.473
You didn't destroy it did you?

57:19.475 --> 57:21.006
Of course not.

57:21.008 --> 57:24.473
Good because I must leave
in less than 24 Earth hours.

57:24.475 --> 57:26.640
But we were just
getting to know you.

57:26.642 --> 57:30.973
Mark if the alien
chick says she has to go

57:30.975 --> 57:32.306
she has to go.

57:32.308 --> 57:34.440
But we were having
so much fun together.

57:34.442 --> 57:37.606
I think we've been having
a little too much fun

57:37.608 --> 57:39.906
if you catch my drift.

57:41.108 --> 57:43.440
Sounds like someone's jealous.

57:43.442 --> 57:44.208
Jealous?

57:45.042 --> 57:47.573
I have these puppies.

57:47.575 --> 57:51.306
Do I look like I
need to be jealous?

57:51.308 --> 57:52.140
Ooh.

57:55.275 --> 57:58.275
Damn
straight girlfriend.

58:01.575 --> 58:04.340
Allie just let her go,
just let her cool off.

58:04.342 --> 58:06.773
When she gets like this, best
thing is let her cool off.

58:06.775 --> 58:10.608
Well I just want to
make sure she's alright.

58:15.308 --> 58:17.840
Wow that must have been
some drink.

58:17.842 --> 58:20.808
Looks like Ted
slipped you a mickey.

58:22.875 --> 58:24.640
Oh hi everybody.

58:24.642 --> 58:26.073
Who's the hot chick?

58:26.075 --> 58:29.306
Tell her, better yet
show her your little trick.

58:29.308 --> 58:30.706
As you wish.

58:30.708 --> 58:34.706
Oh my god
how did you do that?

58:43.275 --> 58:45.606
I think maybe you're
overreacting Cin.

58:45.608 --> 58:47.540
Either way that space
girl's leaving soon

58:47.542 --> 58:49.340
and you won't have to
ever deal with her.

58:49.342 --> 58:51.806
I'm not worried
about that Allie.

58:51.808 --> 58:54.640
Mark and I we're in
an open relationship.

58:54.642 --> 58:55.773
That's good.

58:55.775 --> 58:58.440
No it's not, I hate it.

58:58.442 --> 59:00.706
The only reason why
I went along with it

59:00.708 --> 59:03.106
is because that's
what Mark wanted.

59:03.108 --> 59:05.708
Didn't you screw Ted earlier?

59:07.075 --> 59:10.242
Sometimes it does
have its benefits.

59:11.108 --> 59:13.542
You mean like now?

59:23.842 --> 59:25.673
Now I'd like to play a game

59:25.675 --> 59:27.206
that we play on my planet

59:27.208 --> 59:30.206
that I believe all
you Earthlings know

59:30.208 --> 59:32.108
called spin the bottle.

59:34.875 --> 59:36.840
- Oh me?
- Mmhmm.

59:36.842 --> 59:40.508
Why would you want
me to spin your bottle?

59:47.308 --> 59:49.575
Ted you have kiss Serena.

59:51.608 --> 59:55.042
Damn, I mean that's
it, I mean, I mean.

59:57.575 --> 59:58.975
- Hey guys.
- Hey.

01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:01.973
Can we play?

01:00:01.975 --> 01:00:02.973
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah of course,

01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:04.340
more the merrier.

01:00:04.342 --> 01:00:07.008
Yeah, can I get the next spin?

01:00:16.908 --> 01:00:20.006
Caller's base communicates
a strong explosion

01:00:20.008 --> 01:00:23.406
in the sector H,
F, two, oh, three

01:00:23.408 --> 01:00:26.406
and the zone is not
isolated any longer.

01:00:26.408 --> 01:00:29.473
The radar sentries report
that no flying objects

01:00:29.475 --> 01:00:33.140
have left Earth's orbit
while an aviation scout

01:00:33.142 --> 01:00:36.873
has seen large metal segments
scattered here and there

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:38.308
on the ice field.

01:00:51.575 --> 01:00:54.440
I'm afraid I must
go now Earthling Mark.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:57.506
My time's not up here but I've
learned all I need to know.

01:00:57.508 --> 01:01:00.006
Do you really have to go?

01:01:00.008 --> 01:01:02.573
The fate of my
people depends on it.

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:06.173
Well I hope your stay here
helped you a little bit.

01:01:06.175 --> 01:01:08.073
It most definitely has.

01:01:08.075 --> 01:01:09.273
Oh good.

01:01:09.275 --> 01:01:10.206
Maybe you can teach
the Deltron men

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.573
whatever they need to learn

01:01:11.575 --> 01:01:13.440
so that you can save
your civilization.

01:01:13.442 --> 01:01:16.940
Oh there are no men
on Deltron, only women.

01:01:16.942 --> 01:01:18.206
Only women?

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.506
Yes Earthling Mark.

01:01:19.508 --> 01:01:21.906
Do they look like you?

01:01:21.908 --> 01:01:22.806
Oh no.

01:01:22.808 --> 01:01:24.273
Oh.

01:01:24.275 --> 01:01:26.273
Oh they are much more
beautiful than I am.

01:01:26.275 --> 01:01:27.273
Is that right?

01:01:27.275 --> 01:01:28.473
Yes.

01:01:28.475 --> 01:01:29.606
Do you know you
never really showed me

01:01:29.608 --> 01:01:32.040
the inside of your spaceship.

01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:33.573
Would you like to see it?

01:01:33.575 --> 01:01:34.742
I'd love to.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:51.708
Nice.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:56.173
So my only question
is do we have sex here

01:01:56.175 --> 01:01:58.342
or on our way to Deltron?

01:02:08.075 --> 01:02:11.873
Message
received, over and out.

01:02:14.444 --> 01:02:19.444
