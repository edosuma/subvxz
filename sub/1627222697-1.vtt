WEBVTT

01:23.833 --> 01:25.791
"The lamb is out of the freezer."

01:59.416 --> 02:04.250
The mist… You know it's there,
but you can't touch it.

03:12.708 --> 03:15.041
Pull over! Stop!

03:15.125 --> 03:16.666
Oye, Sapapaya!

03:16.750 --> 03:18.500
You and your friend fancy a chase with me?

03:18.583 --> 03:20.125
Coño, va.

03:53.083 --> 03:56.833
One, two, three, four, five, six,
ten, twenty followers!

03:56.916 --> 03:58.333
Stronger than ever on Insta!

04:34.375 --> 04:36.708
Hands up!

04:36.791 --> 04:37.750
Put the dick away!

04:38.375 --> 04:40.583
Okay, but I have a larger caliber.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.625
I need both hands to hold my weapon.

04:43.708 --> 04:44.541
Coño, va!

04:45.375 --> 04:46.750
Watch out! My hair!

04:47.333 --> 04:49.416
-We're letting him go?
-Yeah. No choice.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.750
Immunity, classified Secret.
Nothing we can do.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.958
Here, Mr. Archibald Al Mahmoud.

04:54.041 --> 04:57.500
You can go. We've checked everything.
With our sincere apologies.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.041
What did you check?

04:59.541 --> 05:01.291
The size of my rod? You small-dick.

05:01.958 --> 05:04.208
I like you, and your stupid-ass face.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.250
Don't like you though.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.458
Morning, Alain-Guy!

05:28.666 --> 05:29.500
Morning, Michel.

05:34.666 --> 05:35.666
Morning, Cyprien.

05:39.708 --> 05:40.958
No!

05:41.541 --> 05:43.958
There you go. Just great.

05:44.583 --> 05:45.958
And with my car.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.250
Paul, we need to talk!

05:47.333 --> 05:50.541
Morning, Mireille. Morning, Josiane.
I need to talk to him.

05:53.750 --> 05:56.375
-Good morning, Paul.
-One second.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.125
One second.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.708
How do they do that?

06:02.541 --> 06:03.791
Yes, sorry.

06:03.875 --> 06:07.041
Paul, I did not want an official car.

06:07.125 --> 06:10.708
Don't we have more important things to do
than talk about cars? But you're the boss.

06:10.791 --> 06:15.750
Yes, I know it's you who hired me,
and I'm still uncomfortable about that.

06:15.833 --> 06:16.833
Fine.

06:16.916 --> 06:19.541
But we'll keep the car because I use it.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.750
-It's easier that way. Okay?
-All right.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.041
-That works. You're right.
-Great. Let's move on.

06:24.541 --> 06:27.791
And, Paul,
I came across an old bank transfer.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.625
A payment for some kind of a…

06:32.625 --> 06:33.458
no-show job.

06:34.208 --> 06:37.291
It's weird
that it's under the Foreign Ministry,

06:38.041 --> 06:40.791
given the president's exemplar pledges…

06:40.875 --> 06:43.000
-You're not wrong.
-It seems a little…

06:43.083 --> 06:45.083
You're right.
He promised some great things.

06:45.833 --> 06:47.875
I think this president is great. Love him.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.583
-What a man.
-Gorgeous.

06:50.083 --> 06:53.333
Then again, don't you think
we should keep our noses out?

06:53.416 --> 06:55.916
-Well, yeah, but I was thinking--
-Don't think.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.250
You're the boss.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.208
I'm the boss.

07:03.958 --> 07:05.541
"Keep your nose out…"

07:06.208 --> 07:08.583
Not me. I'm going to stick my nose in.

07:08.666 --> 07:10.750
OVERDRAFT LIMIT: NONE
TRANSACTION TYPES: NOT ACCESSIBLE

07:10.833 --> 07:12.000
REGULAR PAYMENTS: CONFIDENTIAL

07:12.083 --> 07:14.166
Archibald Al Mahmoud.
1,580 euros a month since 1995.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.875
Great. Living it up on public money.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.000
Well done, Archibald Al Mahmoud.

07:19.083 --> 07:19.916
PRIVATE ACCOUNT

07:20.000 --> 07:21.791
I hope you had fun. The party is over.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.500
Daddy. Grandpa Jacques.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.250
It's time.

07:31.958 --> 07:33.541
SECRET CLASSIFICATION REVOKED

07:33.625 --> 07:34.458
Shit.

07:35.791 --> 07:36.916
Well, that's not good.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.333
Al Mahmoud's Secret classification
has been lifted!

07:41.416 --> 07:47.083
Approach at the 77th department!
Watch out! He's armed and dangerous! Go!

07:47.166 --> 07:48.916
CARD WITHHELD

07:49.000 --> 07:53.875
Got to be the first time
Mr. Archibald Al Mahmoud has no money.

07:53.958 --> 07:55.208
How do I buy weed now?

07:55.791 --> 07:58.500
This is still what it's for?
I already gave you 20 euros for Dalila.

07:58.583 --> 08:02.041
I'm not going to steal weed
from my little sister. I have principles.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.250
What principles? Making me
an accomplice in drug trafficking? Momo!

08:06.333 --> 08:08.750
You're too caught up
in your student world.

08:08.833 --> 08:12.166
I'm from the streets.
I need to smoke. I have no choice.

08:12.250 --> 08:15.208
What streets? We grew up
in Europe's safest housing project.

08:15.291 --> 08:19.375
I choose to smoke before going to work.
You've never had a job. You don't know.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.541
Now I'm twice as late. Bye.
Fernand is going to kill me!

08:28.291 --> 08:29.625
I know, Fernand. I'm late.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.083
-I don't like when you loiter.
-Two minutes.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.541
And I wasn't. I was with Momo.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.125
Beat it! Or you'll feel my broom!

08:38.208 --> 08:39.333
Let's get out of here.

08:52.375 --> 08:53.250
You're something.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.333
Look. I ironed everything.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.541
How are your finals going?

08:59.416 --> 09:01.958
What are they already? My little genius.

09:03.041 --> 09:07.458
Environmental Accounting. Might switch
to Sociology of the Middle Ages.

09:07.541 --> 09:10.291
That's great. Just keep studying.

09:10.791 --> 09:11.750
If I could have…

09:11.833 --> 09:14.375
Could you help me out?
My card got swallowed.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.083
Mom's money didn't come through.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.125
Didn't come through?

09:20.041 --> 09:21.666
The money didn't come through?

09:23.000 --> 09:23.833
Bastards.

09:23.916 --> 09:26.333
-Let's send an email.
-They've lifted your cover.

09:28.416 --> 09:30.791
My covers are okay.
The transfer's the issue.

09:30.875 --> 09:32.541
Away from the window! They're coming!

09:33.166 --> 09:35.000
We have to awaken the Mist.

09:35.833 --> 09:38.166
The lamb is out of the freezer.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.166
I repeat, the lamb is out of the freezer.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.416
We're having lamb tonight?

09:44.458 --> 09:46.625
I haven't often mentioned Richard,
your dad.

09:46.708 --> 09:48.791
Why bring him up?
You're the only father I have.

09:48.875 --> 09:51.041
Listen to me.
Your father never abandoned you.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.041
Never.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.791
He had me look after you
because of that damn Cup-and-Ball.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.083
Cup-and-ball?

09:56.916 --> 09:58.416
Did you take that Alzheimer's test?

10:02.083 --> 10:03.250
They're here for me.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.083
No. They've come for me too.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.416
You too? You wanted to buy weed?

10:18.583 --> 10:19.416
The Big Mac…

10:19.500 --> 10:23.250
Okay, Fernand, you're freaking me out.
Please, let me check your pacemaker.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.416
My phone!

10:26.000 --> 10:30.791
Don't call anyone.
Avoid train stations, subways.

10:30.875 --> 10:34.625
You have to become elusive, like… mist.

10:34.708 --> 10:37.708
Okay, let's calm down.
Aren't we overreacting?

10:37.791 --> 10:39.666
-I never broke any laws.
-Leave now!

10:40.416 --> 10:43.250
What am I to do with this?
Where did you get that?

10:43.333 --> 10:45.583
No point in shooting police
over a bit of hash.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.375
-Get out!
-All right! Where do we meet?

10:49.750 --> 10:52.083
Archie, you know I love you.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.791
Go now! Go!

11:05.291 --> 11:06.541
My little genius.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.333
Let's search.

11:20.666 --> 11:22.666
Stop! Don't move!

11:25.166 --> 11:27.083
-Get down!
-I said get down!

11:27.166 --> 11:28.708
Don't move!

11:29.583 --> 11:30.875
Police! Get down!

11:33.166 --> 11:35.291
I swear I didn't know it was for cannabis!

11:36.791 --> 11:37.625
It wasn't me!

11:38.458 --> 11:39.291
Please!

11:40.083 --> 11:43.041
Hold on! Don't shoot!
This is a major mix-up! Don't shoot!

11:54.416 --> 11:55.250
Son.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.666
Thank you so much.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.333
This calls for a celebration.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.458
NATIONAL SECURITY
TOP SECRET

12:22.083 --> 12:23.541
-Commander?
-Yes?

12:23.625 --> 12:25.458
-We received a fax.
-A fax?

12:25.541 --> 12:28.375
Yes. Who sends a fax
with a code from 25 years ago?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.791
A guy last seen 25 years ago.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.666
What an imbecile!
How can you be so stupid?

12:41.750 --> 12:44.500
-Wouldn't want to be in that guy's shoes.
-Idiot!

12:44.583 --> 12:46.791
What an absolute idiot!

12:47.625 --> 12:49.208
Seems we have a little problem.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.416
What did you do with this transfer?

12:52.333 --> 12:54.000
Anything jump out at you?

12:54.083 --> 12:59.083
A red banner that says "Secret"
and flashes, "Don't touch me"?

12:59.166 --> 13:01.666
Well, yes, I saw that,
but just a little too late.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.291
We agreed you're my boss.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.416
-Yes.
-That's decided.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.500
However, we also agreed
you'd do nothing without my consent.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.833
What part of that sentence
do you not understand?

13:10.916 --> 13:12.541
"Nothing"? "Without"? "Consent"?

13:12.625 --> 13:16.458
-All three at the same time? Maybe it's--
-I understand all three words.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.458
What we'll do is this.

13:18.541 --> 13:23.250
I'll take full responsibility
as your superior.

13:23.750 --> 13:24.583
Yes, Paul.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.625
Stop constantly nodding your head.

13:27.708 --> 13:28.791
You can count on me.

13:30.791 --> 13:34.250
Gen. Hugo,
sorry to drag you out of retirement.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.166
-Madam Minister.
-General.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.750
Jouard.

13:39.833 --> 13:43.333
We're here to talk about the return
of a former agent. Is that right?

13:43.416 --> 13:44.750
Richard Brumère.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.416
Brumère?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.416
-Isn't he a myth?
-You should leave.

13:48.916 --> 13:52.583
Hugo, inform Madam Minister
who we're dealing with.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.125
The iconic commander of Alpha Section.

13:56.208 --> 13:59.416
A special unit
within the division under my command.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.708
Elusive. Hence the nickname.

14:04.666 --> 14:05.500
The Mist.

14:05.583 --> 14:10.125
After we let him go, he became
the world's most celebrated mercenary.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.875
A legend.

14:11.958 --> 14:14.583
Top pilot, weapons expert…

14:14.666 --> 14:16.875
But unarmed is when he's at his best.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.041
I watched him with my own eyes

14:20.625 --> 14:23.666
as he took down a rhino
with his bare hands.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.208
Mythomaniacs.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.208
He'd get out of any situation.

14:29.291 --> 14:33.041
Like the night when Brumère saved my life.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.083
By performing open-heart surgery,

14:36.166 --> 14:38.208
in the middle of a savanna,
using bamboo sticks.

14:39.625 --> 14:42.166
Come on. It's not like he's James Bond.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.333
1995.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.625
Operation Cup-and-Ball.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.916
For state reasons,
the government abandoned Brumère.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.458
Left in the field,
in the hands of the enemy.

14:57.958 --> 14:59.583
-Hey, Colonel.
-Hello, Richard.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.500
Is Farah there?

15:01.458 --> 15:02.833
Minister, it's him!

15:02.916 --> 15:03.750
Put her on.

15:04.833 --> 15:05.708
No!

15:05.791 --> 15:06.875
Yes! Put her on!

15:06.958 --> 15:08.708
Yes!

15:12.166 --> 15:13.166
Richard?

15:17.750 --> 15:18.583
What is she saying?

15:18.666 --> 15:21.833
It's a little intimate.
Personal. Couple stuff.

15:21.916 --> 15:23.041
Translate.

15:25.208 --> 15:29.500
For example, she just said,
"Go back to your whores!" Charming.

15:29.583 --> 15:32.166
It must be their own secret code.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.083
She compared Richard to jerboa poop…

15:41.166 --> 15:42.250
Richard, you there?

15:42.875 --> 15:43.875
Do what Farah asks.

15:44.833 --> 15:48.208
I'll disappear for good.
That's the price for my silence.

15:48.750 --> 15:49.666
Farewell, Colonel.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.625
The worst insult in Arabic culture!

15:51.708 --> 15:53.416
-He hung up.
-Did you locate him?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.750
Ten seconds short. Too bad.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.041
Just like in the movies.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.583
She wants her son, Archibald,
to carry her name.

16:01.666 --> 16:03.666
-Al Mahmoud.
-She can't be serious.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.208
She wants him
to recieve a monthly allowance

16:08.291 --> 16:09.875
for the rest of his life.

16:13.791 --> 16:19.708
And that he be granted lifelong immunity,
protected as secret information.

16:19.791 --> 16:21.541
-No, Minister. No.
-Agreed.

16:22.208 --> 16:23.041
Come on.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.125
Want to end up in Traffic?
With me in agriculture?

16:26.333 --> 16:27.791
Right, no. So, yes.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.458
And she wants daycare.

16:29.541 --> 16:33.000
Oh, no. No. This is a farce!

16:33.083 --> 16:34.625
The president has agreed.

16:34.708 --> 16:38.791
It is my duty, Minister,
to tell you that this is a huge mistake.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.791
-In any case, we've got him.
-No. He's the one who got us.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.041
If he talks,
the Cup-and-Ball will become public.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.083
Cup-and-Ball?

16:48.750 --> 16:50.833
I'd hoped to never hear that name again.

16:50.916 --> 16:53.083
There we go. Thank you, Hugo.

16:53.833 --> 16:57.375
He gave us every reason
to liquidate the bastard.

16:58.541 --> 17:03.500
It's time to make the '90s obsolete,
once and for all.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.166
Let's transfer his son to Brou.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.666
-Brou?
-Yes, Brou.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.041
In Perche.

17:10.125 --> 17:14.541
Less exotic than Guantanamo,
but just as effective.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.833
Do we have any recent photographs
of Brumère?

17:21.250 --> 17:22.416
There he is.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.500
What's that?

17:24.583 --> 17:27.125
The summer fair
at Jean-Baptiste Poquelin Middle School.

17:27.208 --> 17:29.708
The Mist
has never been photographed since.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.791
Sure, act smart.

17:34.750 --> 17:35.583
Bournette?

17:38.166 --> 17:39.000
Commander?

17:39.500 --> 17:40.666
This just came through.

17:41.541 --> 17:43.208
A cup-and-ball from Brumère.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.000
Well done.

17:45.958 --> 17:49.166
I arrived feeling confident.
Now I'll leave feeling anxious.

17:49.666 --> 17:50.791
You should be.

17:50.875 --> 17:54.750
When the last mercenary returns,
things will start to happen!

18:19.458 --> 18:20.458
A finger bowl.

18:22.791 --> 18:23.791
And some cachous.

18:24.791 --> 18:25.625
Richard.

18:27.916 --> 18:28.750
Marguerite.

18:34.208 --> 18:37.916
Between Fernand's death
and your son's arrest… A hell of a day.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.833
They shouldn't have touched my son.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.291
-Is Jouard still active?
-More than ever.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.458
Aren't you looking for his wife, though?

18:45.541 --> 18:47.833
-There were circumstances.
-Not for him.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.583
This is still personal for him.

18:53.583 --> 18:54.791
Your son's file.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.666
He lives in the suburbs.

18:58.166 --> 19:01.708
He's been using that money.
Made the most of his immunity.

19:01.791 --> 19:03.875
He didn't inherit your discretion.

19:03.958 --> 19:06.000
This isn't what Fernand reported.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.541
He wanted you to have a good impression.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.791
I've seen his diplomas.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.666
Knowing Jouard,
he will transfer Archibald to Brou.

19:14.708 --> 19:16.791
Let's do this Boar-style.

19:35.208 --> 19:38.125
Archibald Al Mahmoud.
Let's try this again.

20:00.916 --> 20:01.750
Farah…

20:30.083 --> 20:33.500
Shit! What's wrong with you?
Let go! You're hurting me!

20:33.583 --> 20:34.708
Let go!

20:35.625 --> 20:38.333
You think I'm going to let you rob Archie
because you know judo?

20:38.416 --> 20:40.291
I'd rather smash everything.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.083
-You won't get a thing.
-Wait.

20:42.166 --> 20:43.291
No!

20:43.958 --> 20:45.000
Wait!

20:45.083 --> 20:45.958
Stop! Enough.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.458
Put the TV down, please.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.625
Young man. Miss.

20:53.708 --> 20:54.541
Miss.

20:55.416 --> 20:56.875
Sorry. I wasn't sure.

20:56.958 --> 20:59.166
-You're replacing Fernand?
-I am replacing Fernand.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.750
The authorities moved fast for once.

21:02.416 --> 21:05.083
What a mess.
It's a waste, all this damage.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.166
Who's got to clean it up? Yours truly.

21:11.083 --> 21:14.125
Tell me, this Archibald,
is he your fiancé?

21:15.041 --> 21:18.166
That dweeb? No way.
He's just my brother's friend.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.458
Your brother's…

21:19.958 --> 21:22.916
So he's the neighborhood's boss,
and you're in the business?

21:23.000 --> 21:23.875
Archie, a boss?

21:24.916 --> 21:27.541
What a joke. He's a loser, sure.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.083
That arrest with the SWAT team?
It makes no sense.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.375
Was he arrested before?

21:34.833 --> 21:36.916
You ask too many questions for a janitor.

21:37.625 --> 21:38.791
You're right.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.333
All this chitchat…

21:41.041 --> 21:43.666
Meanwhile, who will take the bins out?

21:44.750 --> 21:45.791
Yours truly.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.333
Hey, I'm not done with you.

21:49.750 --> 21:50.708
Yeah, I'm onto you.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.750
Just admit you're a cop.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.458
You thought we wouldn't come
to your turf to find you?

22:00.541 --> 22:01.375
Shit.

22:02.750 --> 22:05.291
-Colleagues of yours?
-Stop dealing on our patch!

22:05.375 --> 22:07.958
Do you think
this place is your mother's pussy?

22:08.041 --> 22:09.958
Next time, we'll take you down, bitch.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.875
Listen. That's enough.

22:11.958 --> 22:13.541
-Let's calm down--
-Who are you?

22:13.625 --> 22:17.000
-Shut up, or I'll smack you.
-Smack your mother! What you going to do?

22:18.875 --> 22:21.000
My mother? You've gone too far.
I'll fuck you up!

22:21.750 --> 22:22.958
Excuse me.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.750
-She's mine. Beat it.
-Let's talk this through.

22:25.833 --> 22:26.708
Beat it.

22:26.791 --> 22:29.166
Hey, old-timer,
move it or I'll snap you in two.

22:32.750 --> 22:35.083
Spread the news. New janitor in the hood.

22:36.041 --> 22:36.958
What's that?

22:37.041 --> 22:38.083
-We will.
-Thank you.

22:38.916 --> 22:41.333
-We're leaving.
-It's all good.

22:41.416 --> 22:45.500
Don't bullshit me.
You don't fight like a janitor or a cop.

22:45.583 --> 22:47.416
More like a secret agent.

22:48.916 --> 22:51.666
What do you want with Archie?
You're investigating, right?

22:55.291 --> 22:56.125
Dalila.

22:58.833 --> 22:59.666
Richard.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.083
Cool. So, listen carefully.

23:02.916 --> 23:06.583
We'll figure this out together.
Fernand was a good guy. Archie is family.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.083
So I won't leave you, bro.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.083
Okay.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.000
Fernand…

23:25.416 --> 23:26.375
Its ear is missing.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.333
So what?

23:34.458 --> 23:37.208
Djibouti, 1993.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.708
What is this place?

24:05.750 --> 24:08.916
Fernand has a panic room? That's crazy!

24:10.250 --> 24:13.041
No way!
He had everything under surveillance.

24:13.666 --> 24:15.875
That's why the business is dead here.

24:15.958 --> 24:19.333
Yeah. Fernand made sure
Archibald grew up somewhere safe.

24:20.750 --> 24:21.708
What's that?

24:25.458 --> 24:27.708
Stop ignoring me. What's the deal?

24:28.458 --> 24:30.625
You'll have to trust me at some point.

24:32.125 --> 24:35.208
And to me, it looks like you're all alone.
So you could use some help.

24:37.750 --> 24:39.166
Archie, an arms dealer?

24:39.875 --> 24:41.333
No way he did all this.

24:41.416 --> 24:43.583
In GTA maybe, but even then…

24:43.666 --> 24:46.541
Fernand thought
someone was using Archibald's immunity.

24:48.250 --> 24:49.458
Archie has immunity?

24:53.083 --> 24:54.875
Why put that in the same file?

24:56.000 --> 24:56.958
Big Mac?

24:58.583 --> 25:01.208
Known in-house as… the Big Mac.

25:02.166 --> 25:07.250
A weapon developed in 1990
to disable any electronic device.

25:07.333 --> 25:08.500
That's sick!

25:08.583 --> 25:09.625
No.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.916
It's not at all sick.
Too much collateral damage.

25:16.041 --> 25:18.208
Even pacemakers get knocked out.

25:18.291 --> 25:22.583
The other day, in two seconds,
Fernand's building had an outage.

25:22.666 --> 25:24.333
Everything was down. Even phones.

25:26.583 --> 25:27.750
Fernand's last day.

25:34.708 --> 25:36.916
-Looking for footage from the last day?
-Yes.

25:38.291 --> 25:40.541
-Shit. Police?
-Special agents.

25:41.125 --> 25:43.625
Whose work isn't exactly official.

25:49.041 --> 25:49.875
The Big Mac.

25:50.916 --> 25:54.375
You called the wrong Fernand Bouchard
becasue it's a very common name.

25:54.458 --> 25:55.458
Let me call him.

25:55.541 --> 25:57.708
Fernand Bouchard is dead!

25:58.291 --> 26:00.750
-Okay? Stop thinking we're idiots!
-That's not possible.

26:00.833 --> 26:02.958
-There was no Fernand Bouchard.
-There was.

26:03.041 --> 26:04.791
He was Fernand Eisenberg!

26:04.875 --> 26:06.791
"The Bomber." Retired special forces.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.750
He's stiff. He can't say a word.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.750
Did you kill him for his business?

26:10.833 --> 26:11.833
-Talk!
-Look!

26:11.916 --> 26:15.041
-No, it's not possible.
-Look at the picture!

26:15.125 --> 26:17.041
You'll get a life sentence!

26:17.125 --> 26:19.458
With that sweet face of yours,
you won't last two days!

26:19.541 --> 26:21.875
What will it be?
A cell with a ping-pong table?

26:21.958 --> 26:24.750
Or your ass
for them to play ping-pong with?

26:24.833 --> 26:26.791
-It's not possible. No.
-Talk!

26:26.875 --> 26:28.500
-Talk!
-You're dead!

26:28.583 --> 26:30.291
Want to pick up the soap?

26:35.250 --> 26:36.083
He's good.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.500
Hey, toerag!

27:01.583 --> 27:03.291
Que pasa, hombre?

27:03.375 --> 27:05.416
-I need your papers back.
-My papers?

27:05.500 --> 27:07.541
No way! I won't give my papers back!

27:07.625 --> 27:09.250
-We have a problem.
-Hey!

27:09.333 --> 27:11.875
-That wasn't the deal.
-But there is an issue.

27:11.958 --> 27:16.000
-I'm banned from this country, remember?
-You're busting my ear drums.

27:16.083 --> 27:17.750
What part do you not understand?

27:17.833 --> 27:21.166
I'm saying it for your benefit.
I have lawyers--

27:21.250 --> 27:22.625
Who do you think I am?

27:22.708 --> 27:25.833
You want to fuck with Simyon?
No one fucks with Simyon! Got it?

27:25.916 --> 27:28.166
I do the fucking here! Understand?

27:28.958 --> 27:32.791
-I can hear you from a meter away.
-Shove your Big Mac up your ass!

27:32.875 --> 27:36.291
I piss on you, the whole lot of you!
Lick my nuts!

27:36.375 --> 27:37.208
Hello?

27:39.958 --> 27:43.083
The guy hangs up when I'm warning him.

27:44.166 --> 27:47.583
-What do you have on the Big Mac?
-Officially, the project is on ice.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.333
No sign of the prototype.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.208
-What about Archibald's transfer?
-We gotta be quick. It's tomorrow.

27:53.291 --> 27:55.500
They're waiting
for the papers to be signed.

27:57.708 --> 27:58.666
What's bugging you?

27:59.708 --> 28:01.500
This isn't like you. You've aged.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.958
How would you…

28:07.875 --> 28:09.291
I'd set up a team, fast.

28:10.125 --> 28:12.458
I'm not as fit as I used to be,
but I'm here.

28:13.291 --> 28:18.958
No. How would you introduce yourself
to your 25-year-old son?

28:19.666 --> 28:21.583
No idea. I've never been a mother.

28:22.583 --> 28:24.000
Write to him. I don't know.

28:24.750 --> 28:25.666
A letter.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.500
That's good. A letter.

28:28.208 --> 28:29.416
Be careful, Richard.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.750
You spend time saving other people's kids.
This one is yours.

28:33.750 --> 28:35.500
Emotions complicate things.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.125
An operation is still an operation.

28:45.458 --> 28:48.000
Commander,
the route is mapped out as instructed.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.125
He'll be there for his son.

28:50.208 --> 28:52.875
If he shoots, fire back.
Legitimate defense.

28:52.958 --> 28:55.875
If he doesn't, fire back.
Legitimate defense.

28:57.208 --> 28:59.125
Let me know when you have the kid.

28:59.208 --> 29:02.083
Commander, they have the kid.
The operation is underway.

29:02.166 --> 29:05.416
-Who picked up the kid?
-Our operatives.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.250
Don't worry.
All protocols were followed to a letter.

29:09.333 --> 29:12.958
We even received a scanned copy
of the document signed by the president.

29:13.041 --> 29:14.166
We're covered, right?

29:14.250 --> 29:15.833
Except it's not the right one.

29:16.458 --> 29:19.791
The transfer for Brumère's son,
signed by the president.

29:19.875 --> 29:22.708
-He wants him gone.
-Same here.

29:22.791 --> 29:23.791
So we agree?

29:24.500 --> 29:25.625
-Oh, my!
-Goodness!

29:27.916 --> 29:29.916
-It's everywhere.
-May I?

29:38.916 --> 29:39.875
Brumère…

29:43.125 --> 29:44.833
I don't want to escape!

29:47.916 --> 29:49.916
-Madeleine.
-For the good old days.

29:50.625 --> 29:52.291
You're on your own now, the Mist.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.166
Okay, Joe. Madeleine. Thanks.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.625
What good old days?
Joe? Where are we going?

29:58.708 --> 30:00.208
There's no time. Get in.

30:00.291 --> 30:03.041
No way I'm getting in this car!
I don't want to escape!

30:03.125 --> 30:05.916
I'm someone
who also grieves for Fernand. Get in.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.250
All right. Sure.

30:12.291 --> 30:13.166
First gear.

30:20.291 --> 30:21.166
You can't drive?

30:21.916 --> 30:22.750
No.

30:22.833 --> 30:25.250
It's surprising you don't know
how to drive at your age.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.500
Relax. No one will think
to follow a driving-school car.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.541
I'm happy to meet you.

30:36.625 --> 30:37.708
Really.

30:37.791 --> 30:40.541
Plus, you look handsome.

30:43.625 --> 30:44.458
What do you do?

30:46.291 --> 30:48.333
I think I'll get out here.

30:48.416 --> 30:50.750
You're not getting out. Put it in third.

30:54.083 --> 30:56.583
Did Fernand ever talk about your dad?

30:57.291 --> 30:58.791
I know he's a jerk.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.041
No, he's not a jerk.

31:01.125 --> 31:03.166
-You know him?
-Yes, a little.

31:03.250 --> 31:06.333
He's a great guy. He's smart.

31:06.416 --> 31:07.875
And someone who…

31:07.958 --> 31:09.333
Great reputation.

31:09.416 --> 31:10.666
A good guy, you know?

31:11.166 --> 31:15.083
-You know him better than I do.
-Yes. He sent me to help you.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.458
-What?
-Yeah.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.375
Help me?

31:18.041 --> 31:20.166
-This is helping?
-Yes.

31:27.333 --> 31:28.291
You know what?

31:28.375 --> 31:29.750
I'm getting out here.

31:29.833 --> 31:32.666
And if you're such good friends,
you can tell the jerk

31:32.750 --> 31:35.500
to do as usual and forget about me!

31:36.250 --> 31:38.041
Archibald! Archibald, come back!

31:39.041 --> 31:41.750
-Archibald, get in!
-They're shooting at us!

32:06.500 --> 32:09.708
-Do as I say if you don't want to die.
-I don't want to die!

32:12.416 --> 32:15.250
Let go of the steering wheel.
Let go of it!

32:15.333 --> 32:18.583
-Like in the movies.
-What do you mean like in the movies?

32:20.833 --> 32:23.416
-The police! No, the police!
-Pull over!

32:23.500 --> 32:24.750
Stop the car!

32:27.625 --> 32:28.583
Careful.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.875
Help! I don't want to die!

32:45.250 --> 32:46.958
That's pretty high-pitched.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.458
Faster!

32:55.541 --> 32:57.708
Put it in fourth. You're learning.

32:57.791 --> 32:59.041
-Are you crazy?
-Yeah.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.666
I'm holding the steering wheel!

33:02.750 --> 33:05.125
-Don't hold it.
-You can have it!

33:05.208 --> 33:08.458
Show some dignity!
Archibald, let go of the steering wheel.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.708
-But what did we do?
-We turned.

33:50.291 --> 33:52.208
-We turned right.
-Are they gone?

33:53.041 --> 33:53.875
No.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.291
Breathe.

34:15.250 --> 34:16.708
All right. I'm breathing.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.000
Get down!

34:20.416 --> 34:21.416
What's going on?

34:21.500 --> 34:22.416
Are you crazy?

34:34.291 --> 34:36.458
Get out of the way!

34:47.958 --> 34:48.958
Brake gently.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.250
Well, young man,

34:55.166 --> 34:56.208
you failed.

35:00.250 --> 35:01.625
All that to come back here?

35:12.750 --> 35:13.625
Dalila?

35:15.791 --> 35:16.625
Hey, Archie.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.833
-Hey.
-Sorry about Fernand.

35:20.166 --> 35:23.875
Still, you were a badass.
You escaped. Didn't you freak out?

35:24.583 --> 35:27.416
Me? Seriously? Not at all.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.125
Not at all? But a little though.

35:29.875 --> 35:32.041
Or do you always squeal like that?

35:33.166 --> 35:34.583
There was a minor setback.

35:35.083 --> 35:38.500
A minor setback? Excuse me
for not being calm while getting shot at.

35:38.583 --> 35:41.708
-You got shot at?
-From all sides. Everywhere.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.166
You've met?

35:43.750 --> 35:45.583
You're lucky to have a friend like her.

35:46.083 --> 35:47.333
Real recognize real, bro.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.625
How do I explain the escape
to the president?

35:54.375 --> 35:57.291
Our operatives are on his tail,
sir-- Madam Minister.

35:57.375 --> 35:59.125
And what does he have to say?

35:59.208 --> 36:01.416
-Did you stop the bank transfer?
-Yes.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.625
-So you know Brumère?
-No!

36:04.708 --> 36:08.125
He says he was following
some stupid ministerial memo.

36:08.208 --> 36:09.625
Yes. Mine.

36:10.375 --> 36:13.875
I'm sorry, sir-- Madam Minister.

36:13.958 --> 36:16.250
Well, you know what I mean.

36:16.333 --> 36:18.666
He can't be Brumère's accomplice.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.041
Yes, I can see that.

36:20.958 --> 36:23.083
-Not the sharpest tool.
-Right.

36:23.166 --> 36:26.916
-So?
-He's more likely to be his target.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.125
You want to use him as bait?

36:30.708 --> 36:31.791
Yes.

36:33.166 --> 36:36.250
-He's still a government member.
-Yes.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.375
So let's look after him.

36:39.458 --> 36:40.458
Yes.

36:43.666 --> 36:45.875
You'll get what's coming to you, big boy.

36:47.125 --> 36:49.541
Fernand… Secret agent.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.250
Your dad is a secret agent too.

36:53.333 --> 36:55.500
Look, I don't care about the jerk.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.750
I know his name is Richard,
and that's enough.

36:59.208 --> 37:00.583
What's your name again?

37:01.583 --> 37:02.416
Call me Georges.

37:03.583 --> 37:05.833
-Georges?
-Georges, yes. As in Georges.

37:06.750 --> 37:07.583
Georges.

37:08.791 --> 37:11.125
I can't let you talk
about Richard like that.

37:12.208 --> 37:14.708
You'd abandon your son?
Would you, Georges?

37:15.833 --> 37:16.666
No.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.250
You're hurt, Georges?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.666
A bit of shrapnel,
lodged between two vertebrae.

37:27.208 --> 37:28.666
Every now and then, it hurts.

37:28.750 --> 37:32.125
-Why do they all want my head?
-Someone used your identity to sell arms.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.458
-Why me?
-Your dad gave you total immunity.

37:35.541 --> 37:36.916
You hear me? Total.

37:37.541 --> 37:40.541
What father gives his son
a permit to break the law?

37:41.458 --> 37:43.125
Says a lot about the guy.

37:43.916 --> 37:47.416
-Maybe it was your mother's idea.
-You clearly don't know her.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.958
Has to be that guy's idea.

37:50.041 --> 37:53.291
The guy who arranged for you
to receive an allowance every month?

37:53.875 --> 37:55.250
You have an allowance?

37:55.333 --> 37:57.375
Yes. It's a small scholarship.

37:57.458 --> 38:00.625
A small scholarship? 1,580 euros a month?

38:00.708 --> 38:02.833
I have the government
to thank for that, not--

38:02.916 --> 38:03.750
The government?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.041
It's responsible
for your problems, Archibald.

38:07.125 --> 38:12.750
All I know is that Fernand, my real dad,
died because of my biological father.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.250
Crazy shit.

38:21.333 --> 38:25.375
I'm in the changing room--
Just thinking about this makes me laugh.

38:25.458 --> 38:28.625
I get changed, put my clothes in,
enter the code, and I look--

38:28.708 --> 38:30.125
Shut up. Shut your mouth.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.458
That's your way of--

38:31.541 --> 38:33.208
-Shut up!
-Yeah. Okay.

38:33.916 --> 38:36.916
There's a troublemaker
who's creating a problem--

38:37.000 --> 38:40.208
-But it's nothing serious. No need to--
-What's this hassa shit?

38:41.250 --> 38:43.333
-You know what a hassa is, Paul?
-Yes.

38:43.416 --> 38:46.000
-Hassa is a pig…
-That doesn't fly straight. I know.

38:46.083 --> 38:48.458
It's from Scarface. Sick dialogue.

38:48.541 --> 38:51.375
Did you know
Oliver Stone wrote the dialogue?

38:51.458 --> 38:52.625
Nonsense. It's Tony Montana.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.916
Tony Montana is a character in the film.
It's not a--

38:58.000 --> 39:00.791
-Like we give a shit, okay?
-Exactly. You're absolutely right.

39:00.875 --> 39:03.625
I can't provide transport
without the papers.

39:05.541 --> 39:08.041
-If Dad finds out, he'll kill me.
-What about me?

39:08.125 --> 39:10.750
-And if I'm dead, no more sales. Got it?
-What?

39:11.375 --> 39:14.666
No, this sale has to happen.
We must trust each other, for fuck's sake.

39:14.750 --> 39:17.500
Listen to me, egghead. Okay?
With your ball-shaped face.

39:17.583 --> 39:20.458
In this life,
I only trust my dick and my word.

39:20.541 --> 39:22.083
Here's an idea. I…

39:24.125 --> 39:25.208
The cogs are turning.

39:25.708 --> 39:28.291
How about we arrange a home delivery?

39:29.083 --> 39:31.791
-Like Uber Eats?
-A Big Mac delivered to your door!

39:31.875 --> 39:32.708
Is that a deal?

39:35.333 --> 39:37.583
Right. I like to pull that trick too.

39:38.166 --> 39:41.458
-Lazare.
-No. Not again.

39:41.541 --> 39:44.416
I've been telling your colleagues
all I did was follow a memo.

39:44.500 --> 39:49.041
We don't think you're an accomplice
of our public enemy number one.

39:49.625 --> 39:51.958
-At last.
-Rest assured.

39:52.833 --> 39:56.416
You're more likely to be his target.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.583
You have nothing to fear.

39:59.666 --> 40:01.875
-Maybe a little though?
-Not at all.

40:02.625 --> 40:05.458
We're going to fit you
with a mic and a tracker.

40:05.541 --> 40:08.375
And if there's a problem, here's my card.

40:08.458 --> 40:10.416
I don't often give it out. Lucky you.

40:11.583 --> 40:14.375
So if I'm getting shot at,

40:15.500 --> 40:16.500
I give you a call?

40:16.583 --> 40:17.416
Yes.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.166
But not after 7:00 p.m.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.958
-And not on Fridays. It's Sabbath.
-Doesn't sound good.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.416
Are you going to tell him
you're his father?

40:31.166 --> 40:33.000
As the Issa proverb goes,

40:34.041 --> 40:39.291
"The camel can go without water for weeks,
but it drinks every chance it gets."

40:40.958 --> 40:41.833
Okay, great.

40:42.458 --> 40:43.625
What's your point?

40:44.208 --> 40:46.208
I haven't found the right moment.

40:47.291 --> 40:48.666
I wrote a letter.

40:49.958 --> 40:52.208
-A letter is good, right?
-No, it sucks.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.375
No! I never talked to the therapist!

40:57.291 --> 40:58.833
You sure he's your son?

40:58.916 --> 41:00.708
It's not exactly evident.

41:00.791 --> 41:01.791
I ran some tests.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.916
-You serious?
-Of course. I had my doubts.

41:07.541 --> 41:09.000
So his mother was just a booty call?

41:09.583 --> 41:12.791
I refuse to be lectured by a drug dealer.

41:13.750 --> 41:16.250
-I've done some evil things in my life.
-No, just the bike.

41:16.875 --> 41:17.750
But drugs?

41:18.750 --> 41:19.583
Never.

41:21.166 --> 41:22.458
It pays for college.

41:23.416 --> 41:26.708
Got to hustle when you don't have a dad.
Or an allowance.

41:26.791 --> 41:27.833
I don't like steam rooms.

41:27.916 --> 41:29.375
What do you study?

41:29.458 --> 41:30.583
Forget it.

41:31.416 --> 41:34.708
In any case, I was working
while you were saving your "non-son."

41:34.791 --> 41:37.125
Fernand took multiple pictures
of the same car.

41:38.500 --> 41:41.083
The car belongs
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

41:43.041 --> 41:46.125
The ministry is in charge
of Archibald's immunity.

41:46.958 --> 41:48.208
The name is Alexandre Lazare.

41:50.125 --> 41:51.833
How did you get this information?

41:52.416 --> 41:56.250
Let's say I have contacts.
People who deal with cars and plates.

41:57.000 --> 41:57.833
Good.

41:59.416 --> 42:02.708
Magnum and Jeroboam.
A pair of mercenaries.

42:03.916 --> 42:07.583
Hired by governments
for very special operations.

42:11.083 --> 42:12.083
Are you a mercenary?

42:15.750 --> 42:18.333
It's in the past.
Stop trying to make it personal.

42:18.416 --> 42:21.833
If you remember,
during that infamous operation,

42:21.916 --> 42:24.083
Richard and your wife were suspected

42:24.166 --> 42:26.583
of not being a real couple
on their honeymoon.

42:27.625 --> 42:28.625
How can I put this…

42:30.000 --> 42:32.750
So Richard went the extra mile
to maintain their cover.

42:32.833 --> 42:34.708
Extra mile? He boned my wife!

42:35.916 --> 42:37.291
He boned my wife.

42:38.583 --> 42:39.708
They copulated.

42:39.791 --> 42:41.291
But who, if not Richard,

42:41.375 --> 42:45.708
could have met this challenge
while threatened with a flamethrower?

42:45.791 --> 42:47.833
Okay, General, I think we get it.

42:48.416 --> 42:51.166
Madam Minister, he screwed her.

42:52.083 --> 42:54.916
He banged her brains out.

42:56.250 --> 42:58.833
A madman.

42:58.916 --> 43:00.625
She was high for eight weeks.

43:01.541 --> 43:02.500
Seriously!

43:03.208 --> 43:04.333
Listen, Guy,

43:05.541 --> 43:08.500
the republic will not forget
your sacrifice. I promise.

43:08.583 --> 43:11.750
What worries me is this bastard
building a team like in the Falklands.

43:12.583 --> 43:16.916
Highly trained spies. Merciless.
Willing to overthrow the country.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
Mercenaries of the worst kind!

43:21.083 --> 43:23.458
Bloodthirsty killers!

43:23.541 --> 43:25.750
Godless! Lawless!

43:25.833 --> 43:27.541
-Don't be stingy!
-I'm going to hit you!

43:27.625 --> 43:28.875
-No phones.
-See?

43:28.958 --> 43:29.791
See?

43:35.541 --> 43:39.000
Archibald, I need Dalila
to talk to this Lazare.

43:39.083 --> 43:40.000
You're safe here.

43:40.083 --> 43:41.750
What? You're leaving me here?

43:41.833 --> 43:45.541
Don't you get it? You're wanted.
They'll kill you the second they find you.

43:46.166 --> 43:48.750
-All the more reason to stick together.
-Trust me.

43:48.833 --> 43:51.958
As long as you stay here,
nothing can happen to you, Archibald.

43:52.583 --> 43:54.625
Fine. Can you call me Archie?

43:55.541 --> 43:57.625
Archibald sounds good.

43:57.708 --> 44:00.250
Please call me Archie, Georges.
Archibald is a clown's name.

44:00.333 --> 44:02.416
-Georges…
-Sure, Archie.

44:06.416 --> 44:09.625
"Meet in an hour.
Quai de Seine. Quai d'Orsay. Alone."

44:09.708 --> 44:11.458
"Brumère." Brumère?

44:14.833 --> 44:15.833
Brumère is here.

44:16.916 --> 44:17.750
He's here.

44:27.625 --> 44:28.458
Brumère?

44:32.166 --> 44:33.000
Brumère?

44:45.750 --> 44:47.541
Do you have a cig by any chance?

44:48.833 --> 44:49.666
No cigarettes.

44:49.750 --> 44:51.750
-You're coming with us.
-But why?

44:51.833 --> 44:53.000
Bye, madam.

44:54.750 --> 44:55.583
Brumère?

44:58.000 --> 44:59.791
Where is he?

45:00.500 --> 45:01.333
Brumère?

45:07.375 --> 45:08.833
Brumère? No.

45:22.375 --> 45:23.208
Hello?

45:23.291 --> 45:24.833
Lazare, it's Brumère.

45:26.625 --> 45:27.708
It's Brumère!

45:29.541 --> 45:31.916
It's Brumère!

45:32.500 --> 45:33.333
What an idiot.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.166
Are you alone?

45:37.250 --> 45:38.500
Yes. I'm alone.

45:38.583 --> 45:40.250
No concealed agents.

45:44.458 --> 45:46.000
And no microphone on me.

45:46.083 --> 45:48.041
-There you go.
-A total idiot.

45:48.125 --> 45:49.000
Turn around.

45:49.625 --> 45:51.750
-Put the helmet on.
-Okay.

45:55.500 --> 45:58.166
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can hear you.

45:58.250 --> 46:03.041
-We're going to change outfits.
-What do you mean change outfits?

46:03.125 --> 46:06.583
Forgot to mention.
There are explosives in the helmet. C-4.

46:06.666 --> 46:09.000
You have ten minutes
to reach your destination.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.333
This isn't fair! This isn't an outfit!

46:12.416 --> 46:14.333
If you take it off, boom!

46:14.416 --> 46:16.708
It's heating up! Move!

46:21.750 --> 46:23.708
-He's crazy.
-Or a genius.

46:28.166 --> 46:29.125
Careful!

46:31.708 --> 46:34.416
-Turn left!
-It's burning!

46:34.500 --> 46:36.583
A guy in briefs is easy to spot, at least.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.875
No last-minute changes of direction, okay?

46:38.958 --> 46:40.500
Remember, I'm in my briefs!

46:40.583 --> 46:41.416
Wait.

46:47.041 --> 46:48.041
Who is this guy?

46:48.125 --> 46:51.000
I won't make it!

47:00.416 --> 47:02.833
Come on. Faster.

47:02.916 --> 47:06.333
You say faster!
You don't have toasters on your ears!

47:06.416 --> 47:10.166
-Faster!
-I'm doing my best! I'm not Schumacher!

47:10.250 --> 47:12.291
See what you're making me do?

47:12.375 --> 47:14.458
Just so you know, three minutes left.

47:17.625 --> 47:18.625
Squeze through!

47:18.708 --> 47:21.291
-Don't stop! Turn right!
-Are you sure?

47:24.291 --> 47:26.833
Something tells me
I'm going the wrong way!

47:31.666 --> 47:32.958
Go under the arches.

47:33.041 --> 47:36.166
Okay, but I warn you,
I'm not touring the whole Paris!

47:36.250 --> 47:37.125
Careful!

47:37.625 --> 47:40.166
Scooters aren't allowed here!

47:40.250 --> 47:43.291
-So is driving in your briefs.
-Well, I'm on a scooter and in my briefs!

47:43.375 --> 47:45.166
Your methods aren't very discrete!

47:48.708 --> 47:51.208
Sorry, my bad! I can't stop!

47:51.291 --> 47:53.958
-Stop on the left.
-It's going to explode!

47:57.958 --> 47:58.916
I said left.

47:59.916 --> 48:01.250
It's not that complicated.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.250
-It's him!
-Don't move!

48:06.333 --> 48:07.791
We got him, Commander Joaurd!

48:12.416 --> 48:13.250
Don't move!

48:23.083 --> 48:23.916
Oh, Brumère.

48:26.166 --> 48:29.750
My ass is already in the fridge.
Could you take my head out of the oven?

48:32.583 --> 48:34.041
Is it deactivated?

48:36.208 --> 48:38.416
-What?
-The explosives that burned my cheeks.

48:39.041 --> 48:39.958
There weren't any.

48:40.625 --> 48:42.083
What? There weren't any?

48:42.166 --> 48:44.208
It was stress. Just stress.

48:45.833 --> 48:46.666
Come on.

48:47.416 --> 48:48.250
Get changed.

48:49.208 --> 48:50.208
Get in.

48:51.250 --> 48:53.458
No. I'm not going in there.

48:53.958 --> 48:55.875
-You are.
-No. I'm not a plaything.

48:56.583 --> 49:00.458
MIMI ICE CREAM
ICE CREAM MAKER

49:00.541 --> 49:03.875
What are we playing at?
You never told me the rules.

49:05.416 --> 49:06.250
Sorry.

49:08.791 --> 49:12.458
If you're going to torture me with music,
give me something more peaceful.

49:12.958 --> 49:16.250
Something relaxing? Beethoven? Bach?

49:16.333 --> 49:18.500
-No? Nothing?
-Sorry.

49:23.958 --> 49:25.916
-You went out?
-Me? Not at all.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.333
It was stuffy, so I aired the place.

49:28.416 --> 49:30.458
-New smells.
-Goodbye!

49:31.583 --> 49:32.708
Turn around.

49:41.333 --> 49:42.625
I have been briefed, sir.

49:43.458 --> 49:44.875
I know you want revenge.

49:45.458 --> 49:48.208
To bring down the republic.
But I won't say a word!

49:51.333 --> 49:52.166
Contact.

49:53.125 --> 49:55.791
I ran into the killers you work with.

49:55.875 --> 49:58.708
Yes, they're killing it.
No need to exaggerate.

49:59.541 --> 50:01.750
We do have excellent staff
at the office this year.

50:02.666 --> 50:04.500
They tried to eliminate us.

50:04.583 --> 50:08.000
I'd love to help, but… I don't see how.

50:08.666 --> 50:11.083
I saw that Uzi
I had under my nose very well.

50:12.708 --> 50:14.083
Who stopped the transfer?

50:16.625 --> 50:19.166
That was my personal initiative.

50:24.750 --> 50:26.083
Is this your car?

50:26.166 --> 50:27.083
Your team?

50:29.375 --> 50:34.000
The car is mine, but… I don't use it.
I'm against these benefits.

50:37.041 --> 50:38.875
No, I don't know these guys.

50:38.958 --> 50:41.750
Your father was the fall guy
for Operation Cup-and-Ball.

50:41.833 --> 50:43.875
-My father was innocent.
-I know.

50:43.958 --> 50:46.291
And now the fall guy is you.

50:48.041 --> 50:49.208
Ridiculous lies.

50:49.875 --> 50:52.833
Don't try to bamboozle me.
I'm nobody's fall guy.

50:55.750 --> 50:58.333
Jacques, your grandpa, a young prefect.

50:58.416 --> 51:02.958
In 1940, he didn't hesitate
to go underground and join the Resistance

51:03.041 --> 51:05.208
when it would've been easier
to collaborate.

51:05.291 --> 51:07.333
Were you friends with Grandpa Jacques?

51:08.458 --> 51:10.041
-We're not the same age.
-Right.

51:10.708 --> 51:14.041
Anyway, he joined the Resistance
to fight the Nazis. Right?

51:14.125 --> 51:15.833
Not to rat on his coworkers.

51:17.166 --> 51:18.166
The solution.

51:18.916 --> 51:23.625
You're my accomplice,
and you end your days in jail.

51:23.708 --> 51:24.666
In prison.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.416
No, you're way off, my friend.

51:29.125 --> 51:29.958
"In prison."

51:31.250 --> 51:32.750
Did you like the scooter?

51:33.250 --> 51:35.458
It's revenge for Cup-and-Ball,
you little shits!

51:36.708 --> 51:37.791
Terminator-style.

51:37.875 --> 51:39.458
No!

51:39.541 --> 51:42.791
-One call to the minister is all it takes!
-You can't do that!

51:42.875 --> 51:44.000
Yeah.

51:44.083 --> 51:46.125
Come on! Spill the beans!

51:47.125 --> 51:48.458
Do it for Grandpa Jacques.

51:50.458 --> 51:51.541
I don't like this…

51:52.250 --> 51:53.083
Paul.

51:53.875 --> 51:56.208
-He's the only one who uses the car.
-Paul?

51:57.208 --> 51:59.416
Paul. Paul Lesueur, my subordinate.

52:00.916 --> 52:03.583
Although he's the one who hired me.
A bit weird, right?

52:03.666 --> 52:07.625
Smart, you mean.
He can say he was following your orders.

52:09.041 --> 52:10.625
Surely he hasn't taken me for a fool?

52:14.625 --> 52:16.666
Archibald, did you go out or not?

52:16.750 --> 52:17.791
No.

52:18.708 --> 52:19.916
I didn't go out.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.041
-Yes, you went out.
-No, I didn't go out.

52:22.125 --> 52:23.916
Archibald, tell me. Did you go out or not?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.375
-No, I didn't--
-Yes or no?

52:25.458 --> 52:28.000
Yes, I went out! I got sad, you know?

52:28.083 --> 52:30.666
I called Momo
instead of doing something I'd regret!

52:31.666 --> 52:34.125
-Headset, glasses.
-No!

52:36.375 --> 52:38.291
I thought we were over this.

52:38.375 --> 52:39.208
Quick!

52:40.375 --> 52:42.333
Where are we going now?

52:48.625 --> 52:49.666
What's going on?

52:51.583 --> 52:54.000
Thanks for the classical music.
It's nice of you.

52:54.833 --> 52:55.833
Get down!

53:03.833 --> 53:06.750
Who is blowing on my neck? It's not funny!

53:07.458 --> 53:09.083
We're not in kindergarten!

53:09.166 --> 53:10.500
Don't leave me here!

53:10.583 --> 53:11.625
Where are you?

53:11.708 --> 53:12.958
Quick, to the panic room!

53:14.750 --> 53:17.125
-Okay! Enough!
-Go!

53:23.000 --> 53:24.583
Well done, Archibald.

53:24.666 --> 53:25.875
World champion!

53:25.958 --> 53:27.541
Aren't you going to use guns too?

53:28.125 --> 53:30.083
Killing kills.

53:32.791 --> 53:35.250
It's an armored door.
It'll hold up, right?

53:35.333 --> 53:36.875
Unless it's C-12.

53:44.416 --> 53:45.583
It's not C-12.

53:46.833 --> 53:48.208
It's C-54.

53:49.625 --> 53:50.458
It's worse.

53:56.208 --> 53:57.916
Don't you forget about me, okay?

54:03.541 --> 54:04.375
You're moving.

54:08.291 --> 54:09.708
What are we looking for?

54:09.791 --> 54:12.041
Every panic room has an emergency exit.

54:12.125 --> 54:13.958
Okay. And if not, what's the other option?

54:17.500 --> 54:20.125
But if you don't tell me, I can't guess!

54:20.208 --> 54:21.458
You have to communicate!

54:23.500 --> 54:26.541
Gentlemen,
I can sense something is going on.

54:27.083 --> 54:28.416
Am I wrong?

54:28.500 --> 54:30.375
Here!

54:30.458 --> 54:32.625
If something is up, I would like to know.

54:32.708 --> 54:35.333
-Please, I can feel something is going on.
-Archie…

54:35.416 --> 54:36.625
Come on!

54:36.708 --> 54:39.000
I couldn't dare, so I wrote you a letter.

54:40.041 --> 54:41.208
I have to tell you--

54:43.791 --> 54:45.750
Fernand! I love you, Dad!

54:45.833 --> 54:49.000
I'm not all-seeing, no pun intended,
but I can sense something.

54:52.083 --> 54:53.250
-No.
-Yes, okay.

54:53.333 --> 54:56.708
But you kind of seem
to overestimate my sense of direction.

54:59.458 --> 55:02.666
-Dalila? Where are you? Far?
-In position, Georges.

55:05.875 --> 55:07.125
Isn't it a little warm?

55:10.416 --> 55:16.416
Come on! Hurry! Go! Come on!

55:16.500 --> 55:18.166
Let's go! Come on!

55:19.458 --> 55:20.958
Come on, Momo! Drive!

55:34.041 --> 55:35.125
-Yeah.
-Hey.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.125
Problem solved.

55:38.041 --> 55:39.000
Once and for all.

55:41.666 --> 55:42.833
Know what we did there?

55:43.666 --> 55:47.000
We eliminated the Mist.
We blew up the legend.

55:53.958 --> 55:56.958
Your weakness led the enemy
to the headquarters. Okay?

55:57.041 --> 55:59.500
You put us all in danger. Everyone.

55:59.583 --> 56:01.041
You really are totally stupid.

56:01.875 --> 56:03.208
I was feeling down.

56:04.583 --> 56:06.250
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

56:06.333 --> 56:08.500
But I exist too!

56:08.583 --> 56:10.541
I've just about had enough here.

56:10.625 --> 56:11.875
No one tells me anything!

56:11.958 --> 56:16.541
I'm being pushed around,
people blow on my neck, dress me up.

56:16.625 --> 56:18.500
I'm not a puppet!

56:18.583 --> 56:20.458
And I'm sick of this playlist!

56:20.541 --> 56:22.875
He's right. What should we do with him?

56:23.750 --> 56:29.333
Mr. Agent, could I get a gun, please?
It's not at all secure here. Over.

56:32.625 --> 56:34.541
The explosion happened in the lodge.

56:34.625 --> 56:38.208
In the rubble, a hidden room was found.
Definitely their hideout. Nothing left.

56:38.708 --> 56:39.958
Did we find any bodies?

56:40.041 --> 56:43.291
Let's hope we find patches of Mist
all over the place.

56:48.166 --> 56:49.875
Lazare was certainly there.

56:50.750 --> 56:53.083
At least it was a clean sweep.

56:53.583 --> 56:56.500
Shame a government member
had to pay with his life.

56:57.125 --> 56:59.375
-May he rest in peace.
-Amen.

56:59.875 --> 57:04.333
The people who tried to blow us up
knew you were with us.

57:06.041 --> 57:09.750
Now it would be nice to know
if this Paul guy is one of them.

57:10.333 --> 57:11.166
Paul…

57:12.166 --> 57:13.416
What a disappointment.

57:13.500 --> 57:16.166
So? Are you ready to go underground?

57:18.250 --> 57:20.500
Microphone on the collar.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.208
Under the jacket.

57:26.791 --> 57:33.041
Secret service agents are very suspicious,
so I need to mark your face slightly.

57:33.125 --> 57:34.833
Listen, I've put up with a lot,

57:34.916 --> 57:37.416
I've been cooperative,
but this is a little too far.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.541
He who wishes to get close to the lion
must smell like a gazelle.

57:46.375 --> 57:47.916
I don't see the connection.

57:49.208 --> 57:53.333
It won't hurt.
But visually, it's very striking.

57:54.208 --> 57:57.375
As long as it doesn't hurt,
I'm okay with it.

57:58.208 --> 57:59.041
Here or here?

58:13.625 --> 58:14.583
Alexandre?

58:16.958 --> 58:19.666
You-- you're alive?
I mean, you're not dead? I mean…

58:21.083 --> 58:22.916
He's alive. You're alive.

58:27.291 --> 58:28.500
I didn't catch that.

58:33.458 --> 58:34.916
Sounds like Bantu.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.916
-What?
-Bantu?

58:37.000 --> 58:38.625
-An African dialect?
-Seriously?

58:38.708 --> 58:39.791
-Yes.
-All right.

58:43.333 --> 58:44.166
Did you just scream?

58:46.041 --> 58:48.291
Speak in sentences. I don't understand.

58:50.125 --> 58:51.500
Try singing it maybe?

58:52.291 --> 58:53.125
No.

58:57.125 --> 59:00.000
What? Caress? Ass?

59:01.375 --> 59:04.208
I can swear he just said,
"Goodbye. God bless."

59:04.291 --> 59:05.375
-Yes.
-Okay?

59:05.958 --> 59:06.791
Right, then.

59:08.750 --> 59:12.375
Alexandre, Did Brumère mention anything
that seemed a little odd to you?

59:12.458 --> 59:15.291
Did he show you someone's picture?

59:16.333 --> 59:18.208
A picture of her? Me? Anything?

59:19.666 --> 59:21.083
No? Okay.

59:21.166 --> 59:24.166
So, what we'll do is,
you stay here, please. Okay?

59:24.250 --> 59:25.083
Don't move.

59:25.916 --> 59:26.750
You're moving.

59:29.500 --> 59:31.041
Hello? Yeah, he's alive…

1:00:21.833 --> 1:00:23.833
Maybe within the circuit…

1:00:23.916 --> 1:00:25.041
On the contrary.

1:00:26.333 --> 1:00:27.666
I usually bring luck.

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:29.791
I'm like a lucky charm.

1:00:30.833 --> 1:00:33.208
Is it my fault if it went wrong? No.

1:00:33.708 --> 1:00:36.791
I'm sorry, but no way. Anyway,
I'm meeting him tomorrow at the pool.

1:00:37.458 --> 1:00:39.541
We'll set a date for the sale, and then--

1:00:42.083 --> 1:00:44.250
Can I call you back? Love you.

1:01:04.833 --> 1:01:05.916
Morning.

1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:09.000
-Is Lazare here?
-What? Who is that?

1:01:09.083 --> 1:01:10.333
Is Alezandre Lazare here?

1:01:11.333 --> 1:01:13.166
Yes. Yes, he's here. Sleeping.

1:01:13.666 --> 1:01:15.166
If you could keep it down…

1:01:15.250 --> 1:01:17.666
We'll borrow him from you.
We have a few questions.

1:01:17.750 --> 1:01:18.583
Come on.

1:01:23.166 --> 1:01:24.708
Big eggs…

1:01:28.416 --> 1:01:29.750
Ah, right, eyes!

1:01:30.375 --> 1:01:31.375
Eyes.

1:01:32.458 --> 1:01:33.750
Like this?

1:01:36.541 --> 1:01:38.958
Suck? Let's keep it clean, please.

1:01:43.541 --> 1:01:44.833
Ah, bigger?

1:01:44.916 --> 1:01:46.416
Okay. Bigger. Still bigger!

1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:58.833
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you Richard Brumère.

1:01:59.708 --> 1:02:01.375
-Are you sure?
-Sure.

1:02:02.291 --> 1:02:03.125
Because…

1:02:04.083 --> 1:02:06.750
Well, it looks more like Homer Simpson.

1:02:10.041 --> 1:02:11.083
It's Richard Brumère.

1:02:11.791 --> 1:02:12.625
Okay.

1:02:14.625 --> 1:02:16.083
That's him. That's Brumère?

1:02:16.166 --> 1:02:17.000
Okay…

1:02:17.750 --> 1:02:18.750
Well?

1:02:18.833 --> 1:02:21.333
Do we have anything?
What does he look like today?

1:02:24.916 --> 1:02:25.750
Here.

1:02:39.041 --> 1:02:40.041
I recognize him.

1:02:41.333 --> 1:02:42.541
That's definitely him.

1:02:43.416 --> 1:02:45.083
The king of camouflage.

1:02:45.875 --> 1:02:47.458
Well played, you bastard.

1:02:48.708 --> 1:02:50.291
-He's good.
-Very good.

1:02:50.375 --> 1:02:52.416
-Very good!
-Very, very good.

1:03:06.416 --> 1:03:07.250
What?

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.708
Paul, tomorrow.
Meeting the buyer at the swimming pool.

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:17.791
-You can understand what he says?
-Of course.

1:03:17.875 --> 1:03:22.458
The numbing of the hyoglossus muscle
inhibits the percussive consonants.

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:27.583
Now we have to find
somewhere safe to spend the night.

1:03:28.333 --> 1:03:30.458
Either the woods or the sewers.

1:03:30.541 --> 1:03:33.291
Ah, yes, first mission,
straight to the sewers.

1:03:33.375 --> 1:03:35.291
The sewers, Georges? That kind of sucks.

1:03:35.375 --> 1:03:36.791
They're totally secure.

1:03:37.416 --> 1:03:39.666
Unless someone knows a safer place.

1:03:40.166 --> 1:03:43.041
More secure for the night,
that no one knows about.

1:03:46.875 --> 1:03:48.125
No!

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.833
As if I knew of any secret places.

1:03:53.625 --> 1:03:54.625
He knows a secret place.

1:03:55.416 --> 1:03:56.291
Pole dancing?

1:03:57.083 --> 1:03:58.500
Yes, pole dancing.

1:03:58.583 --> 1:04:00.416
It's a sport like any other.

1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:02.000
You'll have to show us!

1:04:02.083 --> 1:04:04.875
Oh, no. I haven't warmed up.

1:04:05.583 --> 1:04:07.333
-Well, I'm red hot.
-No.

1:04:10.875 --> 1:04:12.208
Okay. I'll show you.

1:04:15.250 --> 1:04:16.333
That's what I call dancing.

1:04:17.458 --> 1:04:18.291
Yeah!

1:04:20.208 --> 1:04:25.333
See, that's why I don't mention it.
To avoid that type of reaction.

1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:27.791
That's how we dance.

1:04:28.666 --> 1:04:29.916
I love the pole. Yeah.

1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:32.791
-The pole is my friend.
-You're bad! You suck!

1:04:32.875 --> 1:04:35.625
Looks like it requires agility.

1:04:36.416 --> 1:04:38.416
Excellent for the dorsal muscles.

1:04:39.583 --> 1:04:41.250
Exactly! See?

1:04:41.333 --> 1:04:45.208
Your father understands the fitness side
of this discipline better than you.

1:04:45.291 --> 1:04:47.125
Why are you talking about my father?

1:04:47.750 --> 1:04:48.875
Why?

1:04:48.958 --> 1:04:50.791
-Because of him. Standing here.
-Who?

1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:54.791
You're wrong. Georges isn't my dad.

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:57.666
Aren't you Richard Brumère?

1:04:58.791 --> 1:04:59.958
Known as the Mist.

1:05:01.375 --> 1:05:02.375
Isn't that you?

1:05:03.125 --> 1:05:04.375
-Yes.
-There you go.

1:05:04.958 --> 1:05:08.125
The father of Archibald Al Mahmoud.

1:05:08.708 --> 1:05:09.708
None other than you.

1:05:15.208 --> 1:05:17.833
You-- Surely you haven't just found out?

1:05:22.083 --> 1:05:23.500
The old guy is his pops?

1:05:23.583 --> 1:05:24.416
Oh, okay.

1:05:25.208 --> 1:05:26.041
It's him?

1:05:27.958 --> 1:05:31.166
Well, I'm not surprised.
There are some similarities.

1:05:33.791 --> 1:05:35.541
Nah, nothing.

1:05:36.125 --> 1:05:38.750
I'm going to give you some family time.

1:05:39.708 --> 1:05:42.625
Turn off the lights, Momo, please.

1:05:42.708 --> 1:05:44.541
Archibald, I meant to tell you.

1:05:45.291 --> 1:05:46.125
No.

1:05:46.625 --> 1:05:49.833
You wouldn't have said anything
if he hadn't mention it.

1:05:49.916 --> 1:05:53.208
Considering the circumstances,
I didn't have the time to tell you.

1:05:53.291 --> 1:05:54.416
Circumstances?

1:05:55.416 --> 1:05:58.041
-You're a bigger coward than I thought!
-You can't say that.

1:05:58.666 --> 1:06:00.083
He's here for you.

1:06:02.750 --> 1:06:04.041
You all piss me off!

1:06:07.333 --> 1:06:08.166
Archie!

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:09.833
Bro!

1:06:10.541 --> 1:06:11.916
He's not that bad a father.

1:06:15.625 --> 1:06:16.916
I think you need to step in.

1:06:17.916 --> 1:06:18.750
Me?

1:06:21.125 --> 1:06:22.500
Can't you go for me?

1:06:23.250 --> 1:06:24.791
-You serious?
-Yeah.

1:06:26.375 --> 1:06:29.708
That shrapnel in your spine,
you sure it's not an emotional issue?

1:06:30.958 --> 1:06:33.291
-What do you mean?
-It is. I'm in psychology.

1:06:34.541 --> 1:06:36.125
I'm studying psychology.

1:06:36.208 --> 1:06:39.541
Okay, I just started. But I can see
you've been carrying this for too long.

1:07:02.250 --> 1:07:05.000
You know, I was on a mission one day.
In Chad.

1:07:06.583 --> 1:07:08.375
Some days, nothing goes right.

1:07:09.416 --> 1:07:12.208
That day, I took five bullets to the body.
.22s.

1:07:13.333 --> 1:07:15.750
They cuffed me and put me in a crate.

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:18.125
And threw me off a cliff.

1:07:21.416 --> 1:07:23.333
-You should be dead.
-No.

1:07:23.875 --> 1:07:27.625
The hope of seeing you again
pushed me to break the lock

1:07:28.583 --> 1:07:29.416
with my teeth.

1:07:31.916 --> 1:07:33.000
I lost three molars.

1:07:36.083 --> 1:07:38.208
And because speeches aren't my thing,

1:07:38.875 --> 1:07:42.583
I decided to write you a letter
to explain everything to you.

1:07:44.666 --> 1:07:46.166
I don't need your sob story.

1:07:46.958 --> 1:07:49.375
It's simple. You weren't there for me.

1:07:52.458 --> 1:07:53.833
To keep you both safe.

1:07:54.541 --> 1:07:56.666
To keep your quiet little life safe.

1:07:58.541 --> 1:08:01.750
Farah, your mother,
I met her on a mission.

1:08:03.875 --> 1:08:04.708
And you…

1:08:06.958 --> 1:08:07.958
my son, you came along.

1:08:09.708 --> 1:08:11.375
Agents have a rule.

1:08:11.875 --> 1:08:13.041
Don't get attached.

1:08:14.708 --> 1:08:18.041
Okay. I get it. I wasn't planned.

1:08:22.708 --> 1:08:23.708
I loved your mother.

1:08:26.833 --> 1:08:29.000
And where was your love
when she got cancer?

1:08:29.958 --> 1:08:32.875
-I was getting tortured in Chad.
-He was tortured in Chad.

1:08:32.958 --> 1:08:33.791
Yes.

1:08:34.458 --> 1:08:37.708
Fernand wasn't tortured in Chad.
He was always there for her.

1:08:37.791 --> 1:08:38.833
And for me.

1:08:47.125 --> 1:08:48.208
He's my real father.

1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:52.708
Not you.

1:08:54.083 --> 1:08:54.958
Archibald…

1:08:55.041 --> 1:08:57.458
Stop calling me Archibald! I'm Archie!

1:08:57.541 --> 1:08:58.583
Archie, okay?

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.416
That's not the bathroom? Okay, got it.

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.291
Archibald is your grandfather's name!

1:09:23.375 --> 1:09:25.291
-Breakfast!
-What-- Where are we?

1:09:26.125 --> 1:09:28.666
Had a crazy nightmare.
Thought we missed breakfast.

1:09:29.250 --> 1:09:31.583
Today, Operation Swimming Pool.

1:09:32.208 --> 1:09:36.875
We need to identify the buyer, the date,
and place where the Big Mac will be sold.

1:09:38.583 --> 1:09:40.708
The buyer is using Archie's identity?

1:09:40.791 --> 1:09:41.875
Yes.

1:09:41.958 --> 1:09:47.541
The sale of your "hamburger"
isn't my problem.

1:09:47.625 --> 1:09:51.208
We need to find this impostor
in order to clear my name. Got it?

1:09:51.291 --> 1:09:54.166
-That's what's most important.
-We need to get the Big Mac.

1:09:54.250 --> 1:09:57.125
We're talking about the national security
of France here, Archibald.

1:09:58.041 --> 1:10:00.833
I don't give a damn
about national security!

1:10:00.916 --> 1:10:02.791
This is my life here! Get it?

1:10:02.875 --> 1:10:04.666
-I'm coming with you!
-Archibald.

1:10:04.750 --> 1:10:06.875
If the beard endowed wisdom,

1:10:06.958 --> 1:10:08.916
all goats would be prophets.

1:10:10.583 --> 1:10:11.833
-What?
-Sorry.

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:15.000
Armenian proverb.

1:10:15.666 --> 1:10:18.750
-Seriously? Are you crazy?
-Isn't that a bit extreme, Richard?

1:10:18.833 --> 1:10:20.958
Untie me! Dalila!

1:10:21.833 --> 1:10:22.750
Dalila.

1:10:22.833 --> 1:10:24.375
Momo, untie me.

1:10:25.458 --> 1:10:26.875
For your own safety, buddy.

1:10:27.583 --> 1:10:29.458
Momo, untie me. Momo!

1:10:29.541 --> 1:10:31.666
-So how about a gun?
-This way, young man.

1:10:31.750 --> 1:10:34.625
-I'm a whole other guy when armed.
-Untie me! You can't do that!

1:10:34.708 --> 1:10:37.083
You've picked your side, is that it?

1:10:56.916 --> 1:10:59.000
I don't trust her. I swear I can feel it.

1:10:59.083 --> 1:11:01.750
-Why would he prefer to go with her?
-Jealous?

1:11:01.833 --> 1:11:03.333
Jealous? Of that old bag?

1:11:04.291 --> 1:11:05.750
He likes that old bag.

1:11:05.833 --> 1:11:10.750
You know, when Richard and I pick people
for an operation, we look at their skills.

1:11:10.833 --> 1:11:14.916
Right now, you don't have those skills.
Maybe you'll have them one day.

1:11:15.625 --> 1:11:18.041
-Anyway, the old bag rocks.
-Do your job. Listen.

1:11:18.125 --> 1:11:20.416
-Stretch your legs.
-I am doing my job.

1:11:21.166 --> 1:11:24.541
That's it, Mrs. Wolf. Deep breaths.

1:11:24.625 --> 1:11:26.500
Richard, target is here.

1:11:26.583 --> 1:11:27.916
Look. He's here.

1:11:28.416 --> 1:11:29.750
Okay. Stay in position.

1:11:33.791 --> 1:11:36.583
Yeah, Paul. Where are you, dickhead?

1:11:36.666 --> 1:11:40.333
I'm not going to be able
to make the meeting.

1:11:40.416 --> 1:11:42.583
-It's a little risky.
-Shut up. Why risky?

1:11:43.250 --> 1:11:44.833
-What about the deal?
-Shush.

1:11:44.916 --> 1:11:46.166
Did you say "shush"?

1:11:46.250 --> 1:11:49.333
Listen to me carefuly.
No one tells me to "shush," okay?

1:11:49.416 --> 1:11:51.791
I didn't mean to say it. It slipped out.

1:11:51.875 --> 1:11:54.958
Angelo,
I'm starting to get a little tired.

1:11:55.041 --> 1:11:57.750
-Keep going, Mrs. Wolf.
-No, really. I'm tired.

1:11:57.833 --> 1:11:58.666
Okay.

1:11:59.333 --> 1:12:00.500
What about the Big Mac?

1:12:00.583 --> 1:12:02.416
-Marguerite, keep going.
-Okay.

1:12:03.333 --> 1:12:05.083
Marguerite, what are you doing?

1:12:05.166 --> 1:12:07.875
I'm done. I can't keep going.

1:12:07.958 --> 1:12:10.500
Deliver to the land of falafel,
as planned.

1:12:10.583 --> 1:12:12.000
Careful. The microphone.

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:15.625
-You're overacting.
-I'm doing my best.

1:12:15.708 --> 1:12:17.916
It's not an act.

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.666
Falafel. Got it? It means home delivery.

1:12:21.250 --> 1:12:23.875
-Mrs. Wolf, are you okay?
-It's either tonight or never, coño!

1:12:23.958 --> 1:12:25.208
-Okay?
-Shush.

1:12:25.291 --> 1:12:28.833
-Stop shushing me!
-I'll hang up otherwise. And you'll see--

1:12:29.583 --> 1:12:30.583
He hung up on me.

1:12:31.250 --> 1:12:32.083
Fuck!

1:12:32.166 --> 1:12:34.916
-Mission aborted.
-What's going on, Richard?

1:12:35.416 --> 1:12:38.166
Richard, what's going on?

1:12:38.250 --> 1:12:39.250
I'm drowning!

1:12:40.625 --> 1:12:41.583
Get me out!

1:12:41.666 --> 1:12:42.625
Archie?

1:12:42.708 --> 1:12:43.958
Angelo, help!

1:12:44.041 --> 1:12:45.041
But--

1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.291
I do what I want!

1:12:48.375 --> 1:12:49.458
Archibald!

1:12:53.750 --> 1:12:54.625
Marguerite…

1:12:55.875 --> 1:12:56.875
Mrs. Wolf!

1:13:05.833 --> 1:13:11.000
Very slowly
I want to change atmosphere, attitude…

1:13:34.666 --> 1:13:36.208
Archibald Al Mahmoud!

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:39.375
Got you, impostor!

1:13:41.916 --> 1:13:42.916
Do you mind?

1:14:00.166 --> 1:14:02.416
-Archibald.
-I'm okay.

1:14:05.750 --> 1:14:07.500
Ladies, let's take it easy.

1:14:21.416 --> 1:14:22.708
I'm okay…

1:14:56.125 --> 1:14:58.041
-You killed Fernand.
-The Mist.

1:14:58.708 --> 1:15:00.375
I'll kill the legend.

1:15:25.875 --> 1:15:27.708
Why did you kill Fernand?

1:16:09.666 --> 1:16:10.500
Brumère!

1:16:12.583 --> 1:16:16.041
Terrorist!

1:16:17.958 --> 1:16:19.291
I'm sorry!

1:16:19.375 --> 1:16:20.375
No!

1:16:36.583 --> 1:16:37.416
Archibald?

1:16:47.666 --> 1:16:49.875
Hey, girls. Ready to twerk?

1:17:05.833 --> 1:17:08.250
You want to play games? Okay!

1:17:16.208 --> 1:17:18.833
You'd need an army to fuck me over!
You hear me?

1:17:22.208 --> 1:17:26.000
I am Archibald Al Mahmoud!

1:17:31.125 --> 1:17:32.375
You chose your team well.

1:17:35.041 --> 1:17:38.333
Archie, you're going to get us killed!
You moron.

1:17:39.041 --> 1:17:41.791
Hey.
Stop talking to me like that. No more!

1:17:44.583 --> 1:17:45.416
Yeah.

1:17:45.500 --> 1:17:48.375
-Water was never my thing.
-We noticed.

1:17:49.958 --> 1:17:51.625
I can't handle this mission.

1:17:53.125 --> 1:17:54.250
Not with him.

1:17:54.875 --> 1:17:56.250
So now it's my fault.

1:17:57.791 --> 1:17:58.791
Always to blame.

1:18:02.166 --> 1:18:03.416
I wanted to help you.

1:18:06.916 --> 1:18:07.750
I know.

1:18:22.208 --> 1:18:25.166
Honestly, Mr. Agent,
if you'd given me a gun,

1:18:25.250 --> 1:18:27.208
we'd be celebrating right now.

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:35.083
Just a scratch.

1:18:35.791 --> 1:18:38.333
At least we know who the buyer is now.

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:40.541
Simyon Novak.

1:18:40.625 --> 1:18:42.375
The son of the king of Taarghistan?

1:18:43.208 --> 1:18:45.000
Isn't he banned from the country?

1:18:45.083 --> 1:18:48.375
Paul Lesueur gave him papers
in Archibald's name.

1:18:49.666 --> 1:18:52.583
To sell the Big Mac without any hassle.

1:18:52.666 --> 1:18:54.000
Home delivery tonight.

1:18:55.750 --> 1:18:57.000
I'd love a Mickey D.

1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:01.125
Did you get the fake passport?

1:19:01.208 --> 1:19:03.416
In the heat of action,
I picked up his phone.

1:19:04.583 --> 1:19:05.416
Really?

1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:10.250
Taarghistan is six hours away.
Long way for a home delivery.

1:19:10.333 --> 1:19:15.750
How would you get to Taarghistan
without leaving the country?

1:19:18.125 --> 1:19:18.958
The embassy!

1:19:20.833 --> 1:19:23.375
We'll have to catch them in the act,

1:19:23.458 --> 1:19:25.041
retrieve the Big Mac,

1:19:25.125 --> 1:19:27.041
and apprehend Paul and Simyon.

1:19:27.708 --> 1:19:28.708
Excellent!

1:19:28.791 --> 1:19:32.041
Plus, Simyon's father got him
sent straight back to his country.

1:19:32.125 --> 1:19:33.958
That jerk won't bother us anymore.

1:19:36.208 --> 1:19:38.000
-That's not good?
-Of course not.

1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:40.833
No sale means no proof,
no crime, no nothing.

1:19:40.916 --> 1:19:41.875
No, it's not good.

1:19:42.833 --> 1:19:46.458
-I'll never clear my name?
-Your dad will get the blame. So will we.

1:19:46.958 --> 1:19:52.625
Well, I regret to inform you
that my career in politics ends today.

1:19:54.541 --> 1:19:57.083
That's a real shame, Alexandre.

1:19:58.166 --> 1:19:59.208
Thank you, Momo.

1:20:02.083 --> 1:20:04.500
Did you plan something? A plan B?

1:20:05.166 --> 1:20:06.083
No plan B.

1:20:06.708 --> 1:20:09.291
He comes to save me,
and I'm still not his priority.

1:20:09.375 --> 1:20:10.833
I did come to save you.

1:20:11.500 --> 1:20:13.875
I put national security first.

1:20:13.958 --> 1:20:14.791
You did right.

1:20:15.875 --> 1:20:17.041
As an agent, yes.

1:20:17.541 --> 1:20:20.125
As a father, no.

1:20:20.208 --> 1:20:23.083
As an agent, you're great.
You were perfect.

1:20:23.166 --> 1:20:24.458
Yeah…

1:20:24.541 --> 1:20:26.000
As a dad…

1:20:28.708 --> 1:20:29.583
Agreed.

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:31.083
Thanks, bro.

1:20:33.541 --> 1:20:36.041
Archibald, maybe the same goes for me.

1:20:36.125 --> 1:20:40.458
I'd have liked a 25-year-old son
who takes responsibility.

1:20:40.541 --> 1:20:44.208
Not a spoiled brat like you
who can't drive!

1:20:45.125 --> 1:20:47.583
Who squeals like a baby
when there's a fight!

1:20:51.500 --> 1:20:53.458
Who hides behind being a student.

1:20:58.458 --> 1:21:00.333
Look at me, Archibald.

1:21:02.208 --> 1:21:04.666
Life is like an operation.

1:21:04.750 --> 1:21:06.958
Life-- life is real.

1:21:08.833 --> 1:21:11.541
You do your best with what you've got.

1:21:14.333 --> 1:21:16.208
And you, Archibald,

1:21:17.291 --> 1:21:19.333
you'll always be my most precious scar.

1:21:26.625 --> 1:21:28.375
We have one thing in common.

1:21:30.541 --> 1:21:31.750
We're both disappointed.

1:21:37.333 --> 1:21:42.583
Sorry to bring it up again.
How did you mix up a phone for a passport?

1:21:42.666 --> 1:21:44.375
-Shut up.
-They're different.

1:21:44.458 --> 1:21:46.875
You can't miss it's a phone. I mean--

1:21:46.958 --> 1:21:50.250
What if the sale took place
tonight at the embassy?

1:21:51.166 --> 1:21:54.708
Yes,
you've clearly missed one detail, Richard.

1:21:54.791 --> 1:21:56.958
Simyon's flight took off hours ago.

1:21:58.166 --> 1:21:59.166
Perfect.

1:22:01.375 --> 1:22:02.291
I don't get it.

1:22:02.833 --> 1:22:05.791
-Simyon, where are you?
-Where do you think, coño?

1:22:05.875 --> 1:22:07.875
-At the embassy, dick face.
-Yes!

1:22:07.958 --> 1:22:11.375
We'll carry on as planned tonight.
Don't forget mi regalo.

1:22:11.458 --> 1:22:14.250
As for you, don't forget
my 30 millones de fajitas,

1:22:14.333 --> 1:22:15.500
por favor, señorita!

1:22:15.583 --> 1:22:19.291
-You making fun of me?
-Not at all. You speak Spanish…

1:22:19.375 --> 1:22:22.250
9:00 p.m., in my private room, coño!

1:22:22.333 --> 1:22:23.166
Hello?

1:22:24.416 --> 1:22:25.250
He's good.

1:22:26.166 --> 1:22:28.583
Given the security,
none of us will be armed.

1:22:28.666 --> 1:22:30.666
I sense a major operation!

1:22:30.750 --> 1:22:33.333
This is my operation.
I won't involve anyone else.

1:22:33.916 --> 1:22:36.416
-Especially not him.
-What? No!

1:22:36.500 --> 1:22:39.625
This affects me.
I'm coming. That's not negotiable.

1:22:42.250 --> 1:22:46.083
Miss the grand finale? No way.
Me and Archie are a team.

1:22:46.166 --> 1:22:48.791
I'm not leaving
Archie's side or my sister's.

1:22:48.875 --> 1:22:50.791
What's the deal? Do I get a gun?

1:22:51.416 --> 1:22:53.000
Nobody asked, but I'm in.

1:22:53.083 --> 1:22:57.000
For Daddy, for Grandpa Jacques.
I don't like to be taken for a fool.

1:22:58.625 --> 1:22:59.916
One small detail.

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.208
No cash, no sale.

1:23:02.125 --> 1:23:05.958
Thirty million isn't a small detail.
It's a big detail.

1:23:07.208 --> 1:23:08.666
Depends for whom.

1:23:18.708 --> 1:23:22.291
Listen, the Mist, 30 million is a big sum.

1:23:24.125 --> 1:23:26.333
But I can't say no
to a man who saved my son.

1:23:26.416 --> 1:23:28.666
The Mist, look.
I almost don't feel my bruise.

1:23:32.416 --> 1:23:33.583
What are we looking at?

1:23:36.791 --> 1:23:39.958
But remember. Twenty-four hours.

1:23:41.125 --> 1:23:42.416
-Okay?
-Not an hour more.

1:23:45.375 --> 1:23:46.625
It'll be here in an hour.

1:23:47.375 --> 1:23:49.958
Thirty million in an hour?
What app are you using?

1:23:50.875 --> 1:23:53.833
TAARGHISTAN EMBASSY

1:24:04.541 --> 1:24:06.500
Okay. The ballerina makes her entrance.

1:24:21.166 --> 1:24:23.791
Now, Fox. Hey, buddy.

1:24:29.666 --> 1:24:30.666
Oh, don't touch.

1:24:36.791 --> 1:24:39.041
Why do I always play the minion?

1:24:39.125 --> 1:24:40.291
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:24:40.375 --> 1:24:43.708
-I'd like a sparkling water.
-And I'd like a Mercedes.

1:24:43.791 --> 1:24:45.125
We all have our struggles.

1:25:18.375 --> 1:25:19.291
That's a real man.

1:25:24.208 --> 1:25:25.583
He's got a game room!

1:25:29.208 --> 1:25:30.833
-A train track!
- Archibald!

1:25:30.916 --> 1:25:32.416
Stop touching everything.

1:25:33.208 --> 1:25:34.958
Okay. The cameras are here.

1:25:35.041 --> 1:25:37.666
We'll film the transaction
and catch them in the act.

1:25:38.166 --> 1:25:40.750
They'll check the money
before the transaction.

1:25:50.041 --> 1:25:51.208
-Let's change.
-Okay.

1:25:51.291 --> 1:25:52.125
Let's go.

1:25:53.375 --> 1:25:55.000
-Commander?
-Yes?

1:25:55.583 --> 1:25:57.208
Richard Brumère is on the phone.

1:26:10.666 --> 1:26:13.291
-Richard?
-Guy, my friend. How are you?

1:26:13.375 --> 1:26:15.000
You have no friends here.

1:26:15.083 --> 1:26:17.625
For old times' sake,
I'll save you some trouble.

1:26:18.500 --> 1:26:20.666
Hugo is with me. He wants to say hi.

1:26:22.750 --> 1:26:23.583
Constantin?

1:26:24.625 --> 1:26:26.125
Good to hear from you.

1:26:27.916 --> 1:26:29.416
Let's meet, Richard.

1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.666
Let's chat. The three of us.

1:26:32.208 --> 1:26:33.916
Fieldwork isn't your thing.

1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:37.625
As your wife said,
tough to perform without the right tools.

1:26:37.708 --> 1:26:39.708
Listen to me, asshole!

1:26:41.208 --> 1:26:42.375
He hung up.

1:26:43.750 --> 1:26:45.833
Thirty-eight seconds! Asshole.

1:26:45.916 --> 1:26:48.166
It's not one minute these days though.

1:26:48.250 --> 1:26:49.916
So who's the small dick now?

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:56.083
Who is taking it up the ass?

1:26:56.166 --> 1:26:59.958
-What on earth is this, Jouard?
-Apologies, sir-- Madam Minister.

1:27:00.041 --> 1:27:01.458
We're under pressure.

1:27:01.541 --> 1:27:03.833
-Where are we at?
-Good question.

1:27:03.916 --> 1:27:06.083
Maurice, where are they?

1:27:06.166 --> 1:27:08.291
Maurice, where are they?

1:27:09.208 --> 1:27:10.208
Archibald…

1:27:11.458 --> 1:27:12.291
Archibald.

1:27:14.500 --> 1:27:16.333
You're upset with me about your mom.

1:27:18.291 --> 1:27:19.958
My absence in your life was…

1:27:21.916 --> 1:27:22.916
unforgivable.

1:27:25.416 --> 1:27:27.625
But I wasn't ready to start a family.

1:27:30.750 --> 1:27:33.250
Understand?
I wasn't ready to start a family.

1:27:33.958 --> 1:27:36.541
I knew Fernand would be a better father.

1:27:40.166 --> 1:27:42.708
But I was always by your side, Archibald.

1:27:43.333 --> 1:27:45.000
Even for your mom's funeral.

1:27:46.875 --> 1:27:48.208
I was always by your side.

1:28:21.083 --> 1:28:22.000
That was you?

1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:43.958
I swear this is the last time
I get dressed as a hooker.

1:28:44.041 --> 1:28:45.583
You look great.

1:28:45.666 --> 1:28:47.958
That dress, with your figure…

1:28:48.041 --> 1:28:49.083
It's-- You're--

1:28:50.125 --> 1:28:52.041
Never mind. I'll get changed. Yeah.

1:28:53.708 --> 1:28:55.291
ARMED FORCES

1:29:08.458 --> 1:29:10.583
-Great reception.
-Thanks, I did it myself.

1:29:12.291 --> 1:29:14.791
The ice cream is in the cone.

1:29:14.875 --> 1:29:17.875
I repeat, the ice cream is in the cone.

1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:37.291
What? When at the ball, you dance.

1:29:38.208 --> 1:29:39.625
It's a little weird.

1:29:39.708 --> 1:29:41.125
And we're on camera.

1:29:42.583 --> 1:29:45.458
-Put your left hand on my shoulder.
-What?

1:29:45.541 --> 1:29:47.250
Put your hand on my shoulder.

1:29:48.458 --> 1:29:49.791
-Like this?
-That's it.

1:29:56.875 --> 1:29:59.583
This is insane!

1:29:59.666 --> 1:30:02.416
Commander Jouard.
Let me in. I have full authority.

1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:06.250
You're starting to annoy me.
Not on this side of the gates.

1:30:06.333 --> 1:30:08.666
-There is a terrorist.
-Mrs. Meister-Mayer.

1:30:08.750 --> 1:30:10.500
-How are you?
-Are you joking?

1:30:10.583 --> 1:30:12.166
You stop him.

1:30:14.166 --> 1:30:15.208
He let her in.

1:30:17.250 --> 1:30:18.708
Find me a tuxedo.

1:30:21.666 --> 1:30:24.166
Simyon! I'm here, bro!

1:30:24.916 --> 1:30:25.750
My buddy.

1:30:29.458 --> 1:30:31.500
Is Simyon okay?

1:30:31.583 --> 1:30:34.666
He's livid.
He's watching a film to cool down.

1:30:36.375 --> 1:30:39.583
-You okay, Simyon?
-My dad chewed me out thanks to you!

1:30:39.666 --> 1:30:42.833
-No need to--
-Shut up! I'm stuck here, like a rat.

1:30:44.208 --> 1:30:45.083
Well, anyway--

1:30:45.958 --> 1:30:47.708
-Please--
-You have my gift?

1:30:47.791 --> 1:30:49.125
Yes, I have it.

1:30:49.208 --> 1:30:51.541
Do you have my little envelope?

1:30:52.541 --> 1:30:54.166
Evening. How are you? Yeah.

1:30:58.375 --> 1:31:03.583
This is the latest version of the Big Mac!

1:31:05.375 --> 1:31:06.625
-Cuddle me.
-No.

1:31:07.708 --> 1:31:08.541
Stop it!

1:31:09.875 --> 1:31:11.333
-Touch me.
-But…

1:31:12.208 --> 1:31:14.000
Why? We have our backs turned.

1:31:15.250 --> 1:31:17.000
There. One Big Mac to go.

1:31:17.083 --> 1:31:20.791
Okay, right, well--

1:31:22.333 --> 1:31:25.083
Okay. So… Fascinating.

1:31:26.833 --> 1:31:28.666
-What's that?
-I panicked.

1:31:28.750 --> 1:31:29.666
Holy cow.

1:31:31.583 --> 1:31:34.250
-Come on!
-I'll go.

1:31:34.333 --> 1:31:37.583
I'll leave you to your personal affairs.

1:31:38.208 --> 1:31:40.208
-Deal!
-And we have a deal.

1:31:42.583 --> 1:31:43.875
Let's watch a movie.

1:31:43.958 --> 1:31:45.750
-Not interested.
-Simyon!

1:31:47.083 --> 1:31:48.041
I'm here, bro.

1:31:49.291 --> 1:31:50.125
My buddy.

1:31:52.500 --> 1:31:54.125
They're using scramblers.

1:31:55.041 --> 1:31:57.125
Looks like a minor technical issue…

1:31:57.875 --> 1:32:00.958
Richard Brumère, also known as the Mist.

1:32:04.541 --> 1:32:05.833
Dalila, plan B!

1:32:17.958 --> 1:32:19.125
Girls.

1:32:19.208 --> 1:32:20.208
Want to play?

1:32:22.583 --> 1:32:23.416
Let's play.

1:32:31.125 --> 1:32:32.041
With music!

1:33:07.500 --> 1:33:08.541
You okay?

1:33:26.125 --> 1:33:28.000
Magnum, get off!

1:33:29.541 --> 1:33:30.666
No!

1:33:36.750 --> 1:33:38.458
-No, Archie!
-What?

1:33:38.541 --> 1:33:40.541
-Follow the plan!
-You're not in charge.

1:33:41.708 --> 1:33:42.541
Let go!

1:33:55.916 --> 1:33:57.333
No! Dad, duck!

1:34:38.708 --> 1:34:40.000
Where are you going?

1:34:44.625 --> 1:34:45.958
This is our mission!

1:34:46.041 --> 1:34:48.125
No "yours" or "ours." It's mine!

1:34:55.875 --> 1:34:57.875
You're biting me? Are you crazy?

1:34:57.958 --> 1:34:59.916
Let go! No!

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:01.875
-Richard.
-Marguerite?

1:35:02.500 --> 1:35:03.625
Let go!

1:35:06.583 --> 1:35:08.208
I've always got your back.

1:35:09.666 --> 1:35:12.291
Hand Paul over to the police.
Take the money.

1:35:12.375 --> 1:35:14.166
You two, go with Marguerite.

1:35:14.250 --> 1:35:16.291
-I won't leave you.
-Archibald.

1:35:16.916 --> 1:35:18.166
You're my priority.

1:35:18.250 --> 1:35:22.083
Back in the game, at last.
So long as I'm not in a bathing suit.

1:35:22.166 --> 1:35:24.958
-Do as your dad says.
-You're hurting me.

1:35:25.041 --> 1:35:25.916
Shut up!

1:35:29.916 --> 1:35:32.500
Hey! It's all good.

1:35:44.958 --> 1:35:47.541
Get ready for your suppository.

1:35:54.208 --> 1:35:55.958
Do it!

1:35:56.666 --> 1:35:57.833
No, killing kills.

1:36:06.250 --> 1:36:08.416
Looks like I've arrived in time.

1:36:08.500 --> 1:36:09.416
Right?

1:36:11.916 --> 1:36:12.750
Good job.

1:36:13.333 --> 1:36:16.125
Very graceful, slick, and efficient.

1:36:17.125 --> 1:36:20.458
Thanks. I haven't even warmed up.
I messed up my landing.

1:36:21.166 --> 1:36:23.000
I usually add a little more pizzazz.

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:25.666
You're making a big mistake.

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.500
You're hurting me, Mom.

1:36:31.291 --> 1:36:32.666
-Did you say "mom"?
-No.

1:36:32.750 --> 1:36:33.958
Yes, you said "mom."

1:36:34.041 --> 1:36:36.041
-Yes, you said "mom."
-You did.

1:36:37.958 --> 1:36:39.583
-I didn't say it.
-Dalila.

1:36:42.125 --> 1:36:44.166
What are you doing? Marguerite!

1:36:44.250 --> 1:36:45.875
I'm not a weapon!

1:36:45.958 --> 1:36:47.041
We don't need her.

1:36:49.500 --> 1:36:51.791
Coming through. Sorry.

1:36:51.875 --> 1:36:53.958
-Sorry?
-Sure, she's his mom.

1:36:54.041 --> 1:36:58.875
I never forget a face. I recognized her.
He carries a picture of her in his wallet.

1:36:58.958 --> 1:37:00.916
Marguerite? But… No.

1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:02.375
No.

1:37:03.083 --> 1:37:06.166
Don't tell me you're learning
who is whose parent from me again?

1:37:07.708 --> 1:37:10.166
You should do your homework, Mr. Brumère.

1:37:10.666 --> 1:37:11.750
Okay.

1:37:11.833 --> 1:37:13.166
Okay. Let's go.

1:37:13.250 --> 1:37:16.041
Can you help
or do I have to do everything?

1:37:16.125 --> 1:37:19.583
Stop talking me down, Mom.
Why do I lack confidence?

1:37:19.666 --> 1:37:22.875
Because for all these years,
you belittled me.

1:37:23.541 --> 1:37:24.875
I have a lot going--

1:37:25.458 --> 1:37:26.541
Hands off my son.

1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.083
Marguerite…

1:37:31.250 --> 1:37:32.083
Marguerite.

1:37:33.250 --> 1:37:34.125
Why?

1:37:34.208 --> 1:37:36.208
Why? For the dough, Richard.

1:37:36.291 --> 1:37:37.916
And for justice, above all.

1:37:38.458 --> 1:37:40.416
I had no one to keep my kid safe.

1:37:41.041 --> 1:37:42.875
Your kid's no better than mine.

1:37:43.916 --> 1:37:45.541
Here we go again.

1:37:45.625 --> 1:37:48.291
In front of people. You have no shame.

1:37:48.375 --> 1:37:49.750
Didn't know you had a son.

1:37:49.833 --> 1:37:52.708
Had to give birth in secret
in order to join the department.

1:37:52.791 --> 1:37:56.416
But for the son of Richard Brumère,
nothing was too good.

1:37:56.500 --> 1:37:58.375
Pampered by the Republic!

1:37:58.458 --> 1:38:00.083
Had to redress the balance.

1:38:00.666 --> 1:38:03.791
Simyon isn't my first client.
There were loads.

1:38:03.875 --> 1:38:07.791
No trouble borrowing his immunity.
Your kid is a goodie two-shoes.

1:38:07.875 --> 1:38:09.541
Fernand was suspicious.

1:38:09.625 --> 1:38:11.666
You killed Fernand?

1:38:11.750 --> 1:38:14.666
-Before that fool opened your eyes.
-It's over.

1:38:14.750 --> 1:38:18.666
There was Alexandre from before.
Now there's an after.

1:38:18.750 --> 1:38:20.208
He's not the same guy.

1:38:20.291 --> 1:38:22.583
This guy is crazy!

1:38:24.083 --> 1:38:25.333
What happened?

1:38:25.416 --> 1:38:28.916
-The swimming pool…
-You should've done your homework.

1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.208
I was a regional water polo champion.

1:38:31.291 --> 1:38:32.208
A whiz.

1:38:32.291 --> 1:38:33.875
-A real fish.
-A dolphin.

1:38:34.666 --> 1:38:35.708
Why the Big Mac?

1:38:35.791 --> 1:38:38.750
The last job,
and we can finally live a little.

1:38:38.833 --> 1:38:41.750
-Yeah.
-At last. I won't let you get in the way.

1:38:42.375 --> 1:38:44.416
You're making this personal.

1:38:45.791 --> 1:38:46.791
Dad!

1:38:48.208 --> 1:38:50.166
We have some unfinished business.

1:38:50.625 --> 1:38:52.375
Guy, you're late.

1:38:52.458 --> 1:38:53.833
Yes, I'm late.

1:38:54.541 --> 1:38:56.250
Don't worry. You'll get out.

1:38:56.333 --> 1:38:57.500
On a stretcher.

1:38:57.583 --> 1:38:59.416
The embassy is surrounded.

1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:01.000
I've been waiting for this.

1:39:01.083 --> 1:39:02.541
What? What is it?

1:39:02.625 --> 1:39:04.250
Okay. I get it.

1:39:04.833 --> 1:39:08.250
You mean, you and me? Okay.
It's been a long time coming.

1:39:08.333 --> 1:39:10.083
We'll do it mano a mano.

1:39:10.166 --> 1:39:11.583
Look. There.

1:39:11.666 --> 1:39:12.958
See?

1:39:14.083 --> 1:39:15.375
Mano a mano!

1:39:15.458 --> 1:39:18.125
My little chicken.
Was she wearing panties?

1:39:18.208 --> 1:39:19.458
What color?

1:39:20.833 --> 1:39:21.750
Gently!

1:39:21.833 --> 1:39:23.500
-Richard!
-Not bad.

1:39:23.583 --> 1:39:25.583
Santiago, 1984.

1:39:25.666 --> 1:39:28.500
When you freed the ambassador,
I was there.

1:39:32.291 --> 1:39:34.125
Bogota, 1988.

1:39:34.208 --> 1:39:35.666
The blind man trick.

1:39:35.750 --> 1:39:37.333
Stop it.

1:39:37.416 --> 1:39:38.708
Djibouti, 1993.

1:39:43.333 --> 1:39:45.541
-Marguerite.
-Hi, Guy.

1:39:49.583 --> 1:39:50.958
You killed Jouard!

1:39:51.041 --> 1:39:53.541
The only one who could testify against us.

1:39:55.375 --> 1:39:57.000
-Call!
-Yeah. Okay.

1:39:57.083 --> 1:39:58.083
-Let's go!
-Yeah.

1:39:59.291 --> 1:40:02.541
Yeah.
I've just witnessed Richard kill Jouard.

1:40:02.625 --> 1:40:04.041
Protocol 62! Sorry.

1:40:05.333 --> 1:40:07.250
-Archie, are you okay?
-Is he dead?

1:40:15.916 --> 1:40:17.583
Good evening.

1:40:17.666 --> 1:40:19.875
Going somewhere, grandma?

1:40:21.666 --> 1:40:22.666
You want to play?

1:40:24.458 --> 1:40:25.791
Holy cow.

1:40:27.708 --> 1:40:29.500
I arrest you in the name of the law!

1:40:30.666 --> 1:40:32.416
Do something, will you?

1:40:33.083 --> 1:40:34.458
My sister was right.

1:40:34.541 --> 1:40:36.000
You're an antique.

1:40:36.083 --> 1:40:37.083
Let go of my mom!

1:40:37.166 --> 1:40:38.250
Thanks, Emmanuel.

1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.708
Green light from the president.
Protocol 62.

1:40:41.791 --> 1:40:44.416
-Yes.
-We can storm the embassy.

1:40:44.500 --> 1:40:47.375
Protocol 62? Don't even think about it!

1:40:47.458 --> 1:40:49.541
It only applies in times of war.

1:40:49.625 --> 1:40:51.416
And what about the kid?

1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:54.291
-Collateral damage.
-Sending them to be slaughtered!

1:40:54.375 --> 1:40:56.958
His records tell me
he's not the next Nobel Prize winner.

1:40:57.041 --> 1:40:59.125
-Let go!
-You let go! It's Versace!

1:40:59.208 --> 1:41:01.291
Let go of my mother!

1:41:02.416 --> 1:41:03.250
Marguerite.

1:41:04.416 --> 1:41:05.416
Buddies.

1:41:06.458 --> 1:41:07.291
Buddies.

1:41:08.250 --> 1:41:09.541
It's not what you--

1:41:09.625 --> 1:41:12.625
Yes! It's them! I'm one of you.

1:41:12.708 --> 1:41:15.041
-Stand back.
-I'm one of you. Paul Lesueur.

1:41:17.083 --> 1:41:18.500
Great timing, guys.

1:41:23.166 --> 1:41:24.000
Good job.

1:41:26.666 --> 1:41:28.208
Arrest these two clowns.

1:41:31.416 --> 1:41:33.708
Yes. Bulletproof tuxedo.

1:41:34.291 --> 1:41:37.583
Made in France.
I'd be dead if it were Bangladesh.

1:41:38.916 --> 1:41:39.833
Marguerite.

1:41:40.708 --> 1:41:41.666
You betrayed me.

1:41:42.666 --> 1:41:44.625
It's mostly Marguerite. So I'll--

1:41:44.708 --> 1:41:47.041
-You stay here.
-I'll stay. Of course.

1:41:49.500 --> 1:41:50.666
And you, Lazare?

1:41:51.291 --> 1:41:54.416
I'll soon be calling you
Mr. Minister Lazare. Yeah…

1:41:56.208 --> 1:41:57.750
Your family can be proud.

1:42:02.541 --> 1:42:03.375
So?

1:42:04.125 --> 1:42:05.416
Who is the fool now?

1:42:11.958 --> 1:42:12.916
Minister Lazare.

1:42:13.541 --> 1:42:15.250
And you, Richard…

1:42:18.291 --> 1:42:20.458
you always worked with the best.

1:42:21.291 --> 1:42:22.458
I've never had…

1:42:23.916 --> 1:42:26.083
a better team. Really.

1:42:26.958 --> 1:42:28.916
Archibald, you were great.

1:42:29.541 --> 1:42:30.375
Thanks, Dad.

1:42:32.208 --> 1:42:35.250
-Thanks, sir.
-You're ridiculous.

1:42:35.333 --> 1:42:36.750
"We won!"

1:42:36.833 --> 1:42:38.833
-I'm so proud of you, bro.
-Really?

1:42:39.625 --> 1:42:41.958
Me too. I'm so proud. You nailed it.

1:42:42.041 --> 1:42:43.041
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:42:44.625 --> 1:42:45.458
Marguerite?

1:42:46.791 --> 1:42:49.583
As they say in Guatemala,
the llama has always--

1:42:49.666 --> 1:42:51.041
Shut up, Richard.

1:42:51.125 --> 1:42:54.875
Bullshit. Guatemala,
stories about llamas--

1:42:54.958 --> 1:42:56.291
-Shut up.
-All right.

1:42:57.208 --> 1:42:59.625
-I wasn't convinced anyway.
-What a loser.

1:42:59.708 --> 1:43:01.791
Sacrificing himself for his son…

1:43:01.875 --> 1:43:04.208
What about that plastic gun of yours?

1:43:04.291 --> 1:43:06.208
-The Big Mac.
-Yeah…

1:43:08.208 --> 1:43:10.125
Good job. Great job.

1:43:10.208 --> 1:43:12.291
You'll have to come to the HQ.

1:43:12.958 --> 1:43:13.791
Of course.

1:43:15.708 --> 1:43:19.083
Richard?

1:45:49.250 --> 1:45:51.625
The lamb is out of the freezer.

1:46:12.833 --> 1:46:14.500
"The lamb is out of the freezer."

1:50:01.791 --> 1:50:03.000
Did I miss anything?

1:50:03.708 --> 1:50:06.250
-Only the birth of your son.
-Fernando…

1:50:06.333 --> 1:50:09.333
Do it again, Doctor! I have to film it!

1:50:10.916 --> 1:50:12.958
-You're out of your mind!
-Why?

1:50:13.041 --> 1:50:14.666
Stop looking!

1:50:14.750 --> 1:50:16.041
Get out!

1:50:16.125 --> 1:50:16.958
Sweetheart…

1:50:20.250 --> 1:50:21.375
What are you doing?

1:50:21.458 --> 1:50:24.625
I'll always be here
for the big moments in your life.
