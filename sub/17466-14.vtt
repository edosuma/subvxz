15:59.375 --> 16:01.166
doesn’t die
from her cancer,

16:01.166 --> 16:03.500
she’ll die of
her bad breath.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.875
Oh, yeah, yeah, well,
yeah, I did say that,

16:05.875 --> 16:08.000
but, uh, Ms. Stevens
is very, very sick,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.333
so let’s pretend that I said
that in four to six weeks.

16:10.333 --> 16:13.166

ganging up on me?

16:13.166 --> 16:14.333

Okay, you know what?

16:16.166 --> 16:19.083
Honey, I think
it’s time to move on.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.291
There are a lot of
wonderful boys out there.

16:21.291 --> 16:24.458
In fact, my friend Gina has
an adorable son named Declan.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.583
SAM: Well, I guess
everybody has something!

16:26.583 --> 16:29.250
Dad has a special event,
Mom has a friend.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.792
Mom’s friend has a son.
Even Sophia has...

16:31.792 --> 16:33.250
SOPHIA: Hormones
she can control?

16:33.250 --> 16:35.667
SAM: I can’t wait until
all of you get dumped!

16:37.917 --> 16:38.834
HEATHER: All right,
what are we gonna do?

16:38.834 --> 16:42.166
She has held this entire family
hostage since Monday.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.250
Now the weekend’s coming.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.291

16:48.250 --> 16:49.500
I was talking
about at dinner?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.417
-Yeah?
-It’s the Grammys.

16:51.417 --> 16:52.750
-What?
-Yes.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.792
I’m gonna be the backstage
doctor at the Grammys.

16:55.792 --> 16:56.750
I’ll just take Sam.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.875
Oh, honey, you have to.

16:57.875 --> 17:00.792
Oh, that would totally
snap her out of this!

17:00.792 --> 17:01.625
Absolutely.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.500

outfit in the women’s section?

17:13.125 --> 17:16.333
No. This is
a men’s rocker outfit.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.250
(distant music, crowd sounds)

17:19.667 --> 17:21.000

That was a real-life roadie!

17:32.291 --> 17:34.458
Just imagine who
he’s probably toured with!

17:34.458 --> 17:36.792
Man, if those tattoos
could talk.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.959
They’d ask to put
their clothes back on.

17:38.959 --> 17:42.458
All right, I know
what you want.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.083

see you want the real deal.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.834
