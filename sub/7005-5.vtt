WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:04.436
Hi, guys!
Hey, mom.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.938
Ok, clear off the refrigerator

00:06.939 --> 00:10.542
For the "a" I got
on my psych test.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.544
I thought you said
grades didn't matter.

00:12.545 --> 00:16.347
Yeah, I thought you said the
important thing was learning.

00:16.347 --> 00:19.117
I was wrong.

00:19.118 --> 00:21.119
Now, both of you go up
and study.

00:21.120 --> 00:24.189
I want your grades
as good as mine.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.592
But you also said that
in this family we shouldn't
compete with each other.

00:27.593 --> 00:30.228
I was wrong again.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.566
Hi.
Oh, hi, honey.

00:37.236 --> 00:41.206
Notice anything different
on the refrigerator?

00:41.207 --> 00:44.409
Someone took down the coupon
for a free lube job.

00:45.878 --> 00:49.714
No! I got an "a"
on my psychology test.

00:49.715 --> 00:52.984
You didn't throw away
the coupon, did you?

00:52.985 --> 00:56.387
Here is your stupid coupon.

00:56.388 --> 00:58.490
Hey, randy.
Hey, dad.

00:58.491 --> 01:01.426
When is michelle
coming over?
Any minute now.

01:01.427 --> 01:03.428
I hope her dad
gets here quick.

01:03.429 --> 01:06.064
Old bert's gonna help me
put on the independent
suspension on the hot rod.

01:06.065 --> 01:10.902
Oh, well, that's good,
because a dependent suspension
can be so needy.

01:14.607 --> 01:18.176
In my psychology class
that would've gotten
a huge laugh.

01:18.177 --> 01:22.380
And yet here
in the kitchen - death.

01:22.381 --> 01:24.482
Here.

01:24.483 --> 01:27.418
So, you and michelle
have been seeing a lot
of each other lately.

01:27.419 --> 01:28.886
I guess.

01:28.887 --> 01:31.589
I think she really likes you.
What do you think?

01:31.590 --> 01:34.325
I think I don't want
to talk about this
with my mother.

01:34.326 --> 01:36.261
Oh, come on!

01:36.262 --> 01:41.232
Sorry, mom. I'm past the age
where you give me a cookie
and I spill my guts.

01:41.233 --> 01:43.535
I loved those days.
Hey, look, look, look.

01:43.536 --> 01:45.770
I've got chocolate
chocolate chip.

01:45.771 --> 01:47.906
Give it up, mom.

01:47.907 --> 01:50.642
Well, at least
I still have mark.

01:50.643 --> 01:53.144
Oh, hey, honey.
You want a cookie?

01:53.145 --> 01:55.713
Forget it.
I'm not spilling my guts.

02:45.063 --> 02:48.233
You think your mom's weird?
My mom was driving the car pool,

02:48.234 --> 02:51.669
She started singing
this weird song:
"do wah diddy."

02:51.670 --> 02:56.141
Yeah. Must've been from
when she was a teenager
in the 30s.

02:57.643 --> 03:00.311
That's nothing. Remember at
the seventh grade dance

03:00.312 --> 03:02.680
The chaperone who started
doing the funky chicken

03:02.681 --> 03:05.483
With the principal?

03:05.484 --> 03:09.554
Oh, man!
You got the funky chicken mom?

03:09.555 --> 03:12.123
♪ there he goes just
a-walking down the street

03:12.124 --> 03:15.727
♪ singing do wah diddy
diddy dum diddy do

03:15.728 --> 03:17.963
Your mom is weirder.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.798
♪ snapping his fingers
and shuffling his feet

03:20.799 --> 03:23.801
♪ singing do wah diddy
diddy dum diddy do

03:23.802 --> 03:25.103
Hey, mom.
♪ he looked good

03:25.104 --> 03:26.338
Mom!
What?

03:26.339 --> 03:28.073
We're gonna head on
over to the mall.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.274
You want a ride?

03:29.275 --> 03:32.911
No, thanks. We can
"do wah diddy" without one.

03:35.147 --> 03:37.549
So, did you decide
on an engine yet?

03:37.550 --> 03:40.418
Are you gonna go
with a big block?
No. I decided on a flat head.

03:40.419 --> 03:42.620
Flat head? Taylor,
you are an animal.

03:42.621 --> 03:44.622
Just as I have you pegged
as a big-block guy,

03:44.623 --> 03:46.190
You surprise me
with a flat head.

03:46.191 --> 03:48.392
Well, I like to keep you
on your toes, bert.

03:48.393 --> 03:52.196
Usually you're dropping things
on 'em.

03:52.197 --> 03:56.100
Don't quit your day job, ok?

03:56.101 --> 03:59.203
Let's do the rack and pinion,
then try to get to the brakes
if you can.

03:59.204 --> 04:01.405
Ok. I'm really glad
we're doing this today.

04:01.406 --> 04:03.341
You like hanging
with the "tool man," huh?

04:03.342 --> 04:07.312
Yeah, especially
when my in-laws are visiting.
Been there.

04:07.313 --> 04:10.882
Dana, she really gets crazy
when her parents are around.

04:10.883 --> 04:13.017
Not as crazy as my wife, boy!

04:13.018 --> 04:16.954
When her parents come to visit,
she's a psycho.

04:16.954 --> 04:19.156
They're not running
on all cylinders.

04:19.158 --> 04:22.427
They're, like,
a couple pistons shy of a v-8,
if you know what I mean.

04:23.428 --> 04:25.864
What do you mean, tim?

04:25.865 --> 04:30.535
Huh? Honey, I'm...
Bert was telling me about
how crazy his wife was,

04:30.536 --> 04:32.337
And I wanted to make him
feel a little better.

04:32.338 --> 04:38.776
So I made up stories about
your wonderful, understanding,
lovely parents.

04:38.777 --> 04:41.679
I'm sure bert didn't say
his wife was crazy.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.215
Yes, I did.

04:44.216 --> 04:47.085
Dana, she's a total nut case
when her parents are around.

04:47.086 --> 04:50.054
She spends the whole time
trying to make her daddy happy.

04:50.055 --> 04:52.790
Whoa! Do I sense a little
hostility there?

04:52.791 --> 04:55.626
Well, she lets him run
her entire life.

04:55.627 --> 04:58.229
He's a vet.
So she became a vet.

04:58.230 --> 05:01.999
Yeah? What branch?
Army, navy, what?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.635
Animal.

05:03.636 --> 05:07.905
You know, bert,
I was just reading
something about this.

05:07.906 --> 05:12.277
Maybe your wife hasn't
individuated from her father.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.844
Individuated?

05:13.845 --> 05:18.449
No, no, no, no, no!
Time out.

05:18.450 --> 05:21.419
Honey, I've told you
a million times, psychology
has no place in the garage,

05:21.420 --> 05:26.324
Just like a car does not belong
on a shrink's couch. Ok?

05:26.325 --> 05:28.526
Unless the car is in denial

05:28.527 --> 05:31.662
And has a big block
to work through.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.835
That would've killed
in psychology class.

05:36.836 --> 05:41.506
And yet here in the garage -
death.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.777
Can we get back to this
individuated thing?
What is that?

05:45.778 --> 05:49.681
It's a two-hour discussion
that'll suck the life out of ya.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.349
It's an over-attachment
to one's parents

05:52.350 --> 05:54.519
That continues
through adulthood.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.222
Here we go.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.891
Was your wife an only child,
by any chance?

05:59.892 --> 06:02.460
Yeah. As a matter of fact,
she is.

06:02.461 --> 06:05.430
Well, then,
could be a classic case.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.599
Really?
Yeah.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.701
You know, if this is a problem
in your relationship,

06:09.702 --> 06:11.536
You really should talk
with your wife about it.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.070
I don't know.
I've brought it up before,

06:13.071 --> 06:14.506
And every time it ends up
in a big fight.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.708
Maybe I should just leave
well enough alone.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.344
That's good advice
for anyone, jill.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.646
Avoidance is never
a good idea.

06:22.647 --> 06:24.081
Really?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.622
Maybe we should talk more
about this.

06:30.623 --> 06:33.824
Sure. You want a cookie?

06:41.734 --> 06:43.801
Is something wrong?
Yeah.

06:43.802 --> 06:47.037
You know how I used to be
so cool in junior high?

06:47.038 --> 06:48.773
No.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.010
Well, I was.

06:52.011 --> 06:55.646
But now that I'm in high school,
I'm nobody.

06:55.647 --> 06:57.281
Well, here comes mom.

06:57.282 --> 07:01.885
Why don't you grab a cookie
and talk to her about it?

07:01.886 --> 07:04.822
I'd rather talk to the cookie.

07:04.823 --> 07:06.824
<i>(doorbell)</i>

07:09.495 --> 07:13.063
Hi. I'm dana, bert's wife.
I'm just here to pick him up.

07:13.064 --> 07:15.600
Oh, come on in.
It's so nice to meet you.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.268
Bert was just talking
about you.

07:17.269 --> 07:18.936
Nothing bad, I hope.

07:18.937 --> 07:23.041
Oh, no.
Good, good, good, good.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.975
All right. Let's pull down
that sway bar.

07:24.976 --> 07:27.244
Now, we would've been
at this job
an hour and a half ago

07:27.245 --> 07:29.714
Had you not spent most
of the time in the kitchen
with mrs. Freud.

07:29.715 --> 07:31.282
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:31.283 --> 07:34.686
Dana, this is my husband, tim.
Tim, this is dana, bert's wife.

07:34.687 --> 07:36.020
Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:36.021 --> 07:37.655
Good to meet you.
You ready to go, hon?

07:37.656 --> 07:39.557
We're just getting started
on this front stabilizer bar.

07:39.558 --> 07:43.027
I'm sorry. But we gotta pick up
michelle at the mall
and meet mom and dad.

07:43.028 --> 07:45.897
You know, they really want
to make the early-bird dinner.

07:45.898 --> 07:49.800
Great. Another night of your dad
telling that stupid joke.

07:49.801 --> 07:53.938
"hey, bert.
How about an early-bert dinner?"

07:57.743 --> 08:02.013
Oh, boy!
That's not very funny, is it?

08:02.014 --> 08:05.916
It'd be a lot less funny
if your name were bob.

08:05.917 --> 08:07.985
Well, we'll finish up later.

08:07.986 --> 08:12.557
I'm so sorry that
having dinner with my father
is such torture for you.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.025
Well, it is.

08:14.026 --> 08:17.862
And it's all because you haven't
individuated from your father.

08:17.863 --> 08:21.032
Oh, boy!

08:21.033 --> 08:22.200
What?

08:22.201 --> 08:25.703
Jill, she explained
the whole thing to me.

08:25.704 --> 08:30.408
How your over-attachment
to your father is
poisoning our marriage.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.878
You know, I think
that tim was wrong about
that "early-bert" joke.

08:33.879 --> 08:36.214
Yeah, it'd be just as funny
with bob.

08:36.215 --> 08:39.082
"what about
an early-bob dinner?"

08:39.083 --> 08:41.653
Funny, funny stuff.
"bob dinner."

08:41.654 --> 08:44.421
How could you talk
about our private life
with a stranger?

08:44.422 --> 08:46.156
For your information, dana,

08:46.157 --> 08:51.596
Jill happens to be a
highly-respected psychologist.

08:51.597 --> 08:55.066
Well, uh, technically,
I'm not a psychologist.

08:55.067 --> 08:58.636
Well, technically,
what are you?

08:58.637 --> 09:01.406
Technically...

09:01.407 --> 09:06.044
The word that you would best
use to describe me would be...

09:11.483 --> 09:13.518
A psychology student.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.253
<i>(both)</i> a student?

09:15.254 --> 09:19.857
But a very promising,
highly-respected student.

09:19.858 --> 09:21.826
I thought you were a teacher!

09:21.827 --> 09:24.662
You criticized me based
on something a student said?

09:24.663 --> 09:26.864
I didn't know
she was a student!

09:26.865 --> 09:28.967
And your problems must
be pretty obvious

09:28.968 --> 09:32.937
If a stupid student
can recognize them!

09:32.938 --> 09:34.839
Well, for the record,
I should tell you

09:34.840 --> 09:37.742
I just got an "a"
on my last test.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.981
Now, I'm guessing, honey,
that this psychology test -

09:43.982 --> 09:47.819
The "a" was based
on some sort of curve?

09:47.820 --> 09:50.054
I don't think what I did
was so terrible.

09:50.055 --> 09:53.091
I was just trying to get bert
to open up the lines
of communication.

09:53.092 --> 09:58.195
Which is exactly why I've told
you over and over again
communication's a bad thing.

09:58.196 --> 10:00.565
It can lead to nothing
but disaster.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.567
This is not a disaster.
Oh, really?

10:02.568 --> 10:04.836
Then why did bert and dana
run out of here yelling
at one another?

10:04.837 --> 10:07.571
They were just expressing
some strong feelings.

10:07.572 --> 10:10.307
I'm sure they're gonna
calm down, they'll have
a nice, rational discussion.

10:10.308 --> 10:13.678
And their relationship
will be healthier for it.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.014
Hey, randy.
How was the mall?

10:16.015 --> 10:20.618
Wild. When michelle's parents
came to pick her up,
they had a huge fight.

10:20.619 --> 10:25.289
Was it a healthy,
rational sort of thing?

10:25.290 --> 10:27.191
No. It was more of a screaming,

10:27.192 --> 10:30.394
"I can't believe I married you,"
sort of thing.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.965
Right there in the mall?
Oh, yeah.
Right in the food court.

10:34.966 --> 10:39.236
The falafel guy had to
restrain michelle's mom.

10:39.237 --> 10:43.041
Oh, my god! What have I done?
I've ruined two lives.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.842
Let me think about this.

10:44.843 --> 10:47.110
I would guess that
in a psychology class

10:47.111 --> 10:50.147
Your advice would have
been huge. And yet...

10:50.148 --> 10:54.217
Here in the garage
with real people -
death.

11:01.826 --> 11:05.062
Advance! Advance!
Thrust! Parry!

11:06.698 --> 11:08.432
Hey, wilson.

11:08.433 --> 11:11.702
Well, en garde, taylorette.

11:11.703 --> 11:14.238
I didn't know you fenced.
Oh, judith loves the sport.

11:14.239 --> 11:16.640
I find that a little sword play
puts her in the mood

11:16.641 --> 11:19.176
To "parry and thrust."

11:19.177 --> 11:22.080
So, I guess you and judith
are still a hot item.

11:22.081 --> 11:25.483
Oh, yes, indeed.
I find the embers are
still glowing.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.419
You know, I've taken quite
a fancy to your former
psychology professor.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.020
Oh, that is so good.

11:30.021 --> 11:32.856
I mean, I'm glad that I helped
nurture one relationship,

11:32.857 --> 11:36.160
Because last night
in the garage,
I destroyed another one.

11:36.161 --> 11:37.795
Oh, not tim and bert,
I hope.

11:37.796 --> 11:43.133
Oh, no, no.
That relationship still
has a new-car smell.

11:43.134 --> 11:46.270
No. This is the relationship
between bert and his wife.

11:46.271 --> 11:49.807
I really need some advice.
Well, rattle my saber,
good neighbor.

11:49.808 --> 11:51.809
Ok. I was...

11:51.810 --> 11:53.878
Oh, judith! Hi.
Hello, jill.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.313
I am so glad you're here.
I need to talk to you.

11:56.314 --> 11:59.316
I thought you wanted
to talk to me?
Oh, that's ok, wilson.

11:59.317 --> 12:01.886
Oh. Well, fine.
I'll just go over here

12:01.887 --> 12:04.355
And thrust and parry
by my lonesome.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.291
So, judith, last night
I talked to a friend of tim's.

12:07.292 --> 12:10.161
And in five minutes,
I may have ended
a 20-year marriage.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.929
What on earth did you say?

12:11.930 --> 12:14.265
I just made the obvious
assessment that his wife

12:14.266 --> 12:17.769
Was in denial about
her ability to individuate
from her father.

12:17.770 --> 12:21.038
And you came up with this
diagnosis after meeting her
for only five minutes?

12:21.039 --> 12:24.709
Actually, at that point,
I had never met her.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.744
Jill, one of the first rules
of psychology is:

12:26.745 --> 12:28.880
First you meet, then you treat.

12:28.881 --> 12:32.183
I know. I know.
I was just overzealous.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.018
But what do I do now?

12:34.019 --> 12:36.687
Well, I'm reminded of a
fifth-century indian book,

12:36.688 --> 12:38.455
The <i>panchatantra,</i> which says,

12:38.456 --> 12:41.692
"the first mark
of intelligence is
not to start things."

12:41.693 --> 12:44.461
So I shouldn't do anything?
But the <i>panchatantra</i> goes
on to say,

12:44.462 --> 12:46.496
"the second mark
of intelligence is
to pursue to the end

12:46.497 --> 12:48.532
What you have started."

12:48.533 --> 12:52.103
Well, actually, judith,
I was just about to finish
that quote.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.771
So I should go
and apologize to them?

12:53.772 --> 12:55.439
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd finished.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.508
I was merely pausing
for the effect.

12:57.509 --> 13:00.778
The effect was it seemed
like you'd finished, dear.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.113
Well, I hadn't, dear.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.852
You know, when couples bicker

13:07.853 --> 13:09.854
The way that you're doing
right now,

13:09.855 --> 13:13.491
Sometimes I find
that it's useful...

13:14.993 --> 13:18.195
For me to just say bye-bye!

13:22.934 --> 13:25.336
Al, where have you been?
We're supposed to do a show
here.

13:25.337 --> 13:28.339
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's just I've been
turtle-sitting.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.475
Turtle-sitting?
Yes.
Mother's turtle, scooter.

13:31.476 --> 13:33.810
Hi, scooter.
Looks just like her.

13:35.213 --> 13:37.882
Except with
a little softer skin.

13:40.518 --> 13:44.288
She's not feeling well.
She didn't eat her lettuce
last night for dinner.

13:44.289 --> 13:47.925
Well, maybe she had
a salad for lunch.

13:47.926 --> 13:50.494
No. I think she's depressed

13:50.495 --> 13:52.964
Because she's separated
from mother.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.633
She should talk to jill.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.235
Probably hasn't been
individuated.

13:58.236 --> 14:02.139
Is she an only turtle?

14:02.140 --> 14:03.875
I'm serious, tim.

14:03.876 --> 14:07.144
Al, we're doing <i>tool time,</i>
not <i>turtle time,</i> ok?

14:07.145 --> 14:10.013
Here we go, guys. Stand by.
All right.
Where's your trowel?

14:10.014 --> 14:12.383
It's in the truck.
Well, get it!

14:12.384 --> 14:16.621
Put scooter someplace
where she can see me
during the show.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.990
Ok. I'll get her
her own monitor.

14:18.991 --> 14:22.827
Standby in five...

14:22.828 --> 14:25.696
Four... Three... Two...

14:25.697 --> 14:28.765
Welcome to a special live
<i>tool time</i> with your hosts,

14:28.766 --> 14:30.801
Tim taylor and al borland.

14:30.802 --> 14:32.803
Thank you, heidi.
And welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

14:32.804 --> 14:35.172
Today, al and I are
at our project house.

14:35.173 --> 14:37.408
And we're gonna show you
how to lay a brick walkway.

14:37.409 --> 14:40.411
Now, the first thing
you want to do is
pick out your brick pattern.

14:40.412 --> 14:44.147
So you just go
to your bridal registry
at your local brickyard.

14:44.148 --> 14:46.883
Today we're going with
the classic basket weave.

14:46.884 --> 14:49.787
All right, for this section
we've already laid
a concrete slab

14:49.788 --> 14:51.655
Using binford's
quick-dry cement.

14:51.656 --> 14:54.091
This will be a perfect
foundation for our brick pavers.

14:54.092 --> 14:56.227
That's right.
Gary, if you want
to come in here.

14:56.228 --> 15:01.699
This is gonna dry very fast.
So you want to quickly use
your trowel to smooth it out.

15:01.700 --> 15:05.402
While al does that, I'll compact
and level the next section

15:05.403 --> 15:07.871
Using binford's
6100 power compactor.

15:07.872 --> 15:09.640
<i>(grunts)</i>

15:09.641 --> 15:13.643
Normally, you wouldn't use
a power compactor on a job
this small,

15:13.644 --> 15:16.881
But tim's not normal.

15:16.882 --> 15:20.217
Don't talk to me about normal,
turtle nanny.

15:26.358 --> 15:27.591
Tim!
Look out! What?

15:27.592 --> 15:30.427
Tim! Behind you! Tim! Ow!

15:36.301 --> 15:39.937
Scooter!

16:02.794 --> 16:05.162
What's the matter with you?

16:05.163 --> 16:07.898
What's the matter with me?

16:07.899 --> 16:09.833
You cover scooter in cement,

16:09.834 --> 16:12.136
And then you nearly kill us
speeding over here.

16:12.137 --> 16:15.840
Sorry I had such a heavy foot.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.707
I should never have
let you drive.

16:17.708 --> 16:20.977
Scooter is now shell-shocked.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.082
Dana, when I said your father
was obnoxious and overbearing,

16:25.083 --> 16:29.253
I meant it in a nice way.
Not in the office, bert.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.821
Hey, bert, what are you
doing here?

16:30.822 --> 16:33.690
Hey, tim. It's dana's office.

16:33.691 --> 16:36.527
Your gto is out front.
I saw it. Looking great.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.596
Thanks.
I just got it detailed.
I got this great--

16:38.597 --> 16:41.132
Excuse me!
Can we cut the chitchat?

16:41.133 --> 16:43.334
I have a turtle in crisis!

16:45.170 --> 16:48.772
What happened to your turtle?
Oh, he got with
some real bad reptiles.

16:48.773 --> 16:53.076
They put him
in a cement overcoat.
We're investigating right now.

16:53.077 --> 16:55.479
I think she'll be fine.
Let's put her in the back
and soak her.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.182
I want scooter to have
the best of everything!

16:58.183 --> 17:02.219
You know, your finest lettuce,
her own television...

17:02.220 --> 17:04.621
She likes to watch
the <i>ninja turtles.</i>

17:08.093 --> 17:10.527
Tim, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

17:10.528 --> 17:13.029
Well, I came to talk to dana.
Oh, no.

17:13.030 --> 17:15.699
Nice foot.

17:15.700 --> 17:19.569
Is this where you come
when the emergency room
is filled up?

17:23.107 --> 17:25.509
That's not a bad idea.

17:25.510 --> 17:27.111
Dana!

17:27.112 --> 17:30.213
Oh, dana.
I really need to talk to you.

17:30.214 --> 17:32.115
I'm sorry.
I'm a little busy right now.

17:32.116 --> 17:34.451
I am sorry. I feel so terrible
about what happened.

17:34.452 --> 17:38.222
I gave bert advice that was
unsolicited and unqualified.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.592
Not to mention uninteresting.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.793
I should never have
gotten involved.

17:43.794 --> 17:46.030
I am not going
to say another word.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.531
I promise.
Good!

17:47.532 --> 17:50.334
After I say this teensy-weensy,
one more little thing.

17:50.335 --> 17:52.135
Oh, boy!

17:52.136 --> 17:55.940
I think I'm gonna
individuate myself away
from this conversation.

17:55.941 --> 17:58.275
I'll go see how
that little turtle's doing.

17:58.276 --> 18:01.645
Scooter! Scooter...

18:01.646 --> 18:05.415
Look, um... Before you
do anything rash,

18:05.416 --> 18:08.953
I hope that you'll consider
talking to somebody first.

18:08.954 --> 18:13.023
Not me! I mean, you know,
somebody who actually has
her degree.

18:13.024 --> 18:17.261
Well, I think we've gone just
about as far as we can go
with a student.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.496
Look, if you want
to talk to somebody,

18:19.497 --> 18:21.498
And only if you really both
want to,

18:21.499 --> 18:25.535
I know a woman who is sensitive
and incredibly qualified.

18:25.536 --> 18:30.374
It might not be a bad idea.
What do you think, dana?

18:30.375 --> 18:32.543
I suppose we could give her
a call.

18:32.544 --> 18:34.812
She's great. You'll love her.

18:34.813 --> 18:37.180
In fact, she was my teacher.

18:37.181 --> 18:40.350
I think we'll find
our own person.

18:49.660 --> 18:53.063
Hey, randy.
Hey, dad. Where's mom?

18:53.064 --> 18:55.399
She'll be back in a minute.
She's just got some stuff to do.

18:55.400 --> 18:59.436
What's she doing?
Breaking up another marriage?

18:59.437 --> 19:02.373
You found out she was
the cause of the problem
between bert and dana?

19:02.374 --> 19:05.643
Oh, yeah. It's all over school.
"don't go to randy taylor's
house.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.079
His mom will split up
your parents."

19:09.080 --> 19:12.383
Well, they're not getting
split up. Your mom went
and apologized.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.785
And it looks like
they're gonna try
to work things out.

19:14.786 --> 19:17.821
Well, that's great.
But I still don't get it.

19:17.822 --> 19:21.725
Why is mom starting fights
in other people's families?

19:21.726 --> 19:23.727
My guess is that
starting fights here

19:23.728 --> 19:26.596
Has just become too easy
for her.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.569
Why does she always have
to open her big mouth?

19:31.570 --> 19:34.605
Hey, hey, hey! You don't talk
about your mom like that!

19:34.606 --> 19:37.441
You know why
she opens her big mouth?

19:37.442 --> 19:39.443
She likes to solve problems,
you know.

19:39.444 --> 19:42.046
She's not the type of person
that will sit on the sidelines.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.315
How do we get her to be
one of those people?

19:44.316 --> 19:47.051
Never gonna happen.
And besides, you know,

19:47.052 --> 19:50.721
Helping other people
solve their problems
is not a bad thing.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.490
You know, the best way
to get people to work out
their difficulties

19:53.491 --> 19:56.293
Is to talk about them.

19:56.294 --> 19:57.895
Hi.
Hi.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.063
I need to talk.
Oh, no. No.

20:01.899 --> 20:04.702
You just said
talking's a good thing.
He did?

20:04.703 --> 20:08.438
I meant about cars.
That sort of thing. Sports.
Anything like that, you know.

20:08.439 --> 20:12.342
You know what my problem is?
No. But I bet we're
gonna talk about it.

20:12.343 --> 20:16.079
I am the kind of person
who is so eager to fix things

20:16.080 --> 20:19.483
That I don't take my time,
and then they just blow up
in my face.

20:19.484 --> 20:22.185
You married the right guy.

20:25.890 --> 20:28.124
This whole thing with bert
and dana's got me doubting

20:28.125 --> 20:30.561
What kind of a therapist
I'm gonna be.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.962
Well, if you keep giving advice
like you gave them,

20:32.963 --> 20:36.066
You'd better adopt some kind of
a refund policy.

20:37.034 --> 20:39.636
Now, come on. Seriously.

20:39.637 --> 20:42.105
Do you guys think that
I'm the kind of person

20:42.106 --> 20:45.375
To go into psychology?

20:45.376 --> 20:49.346
As a patient or a doctor?

20:49.347 --> 20:51.081
Well, there's my answer.
Come on.

20:51.082 --> 20:52.482
I'm kidding around.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

20:52.483 --> 20:54.718
You're gonna make
a great therapist.

20:54.719 --> 20:57.621
Thanks, I guess.

20:57.622 --> 21:00.357
I really don't want
to talk about it.
Uh-uh-uh.

21:00.358 --> 21:03.894
You don't want
any unresolved issues.
You gotta talk about it.

21:03.895 --> 21:06.897
I'll get the cookies.
I'll get some milk.

21:13.104 --> 21:15.439
I'll get the cookies.
You get the milk.

21:22.347 --> 21:25.615
Today's <i>tool time</i>
is a rousing salute

21:25.616 --> 21:27.884
To semi-gloss
and gloss latex.

21:27.885 --> 21:31.187
But first, on a personal note,
I would like to thank
our <i>tool time</i> audience

21:31.188 --> 21:33.690
For their generous outpouring
of concern

21:33.691 --> 21:35.559
For scooter the turtle.

21:35.560 --> 21:40.063
We were both overwhelmed
by the amount of cards
and flowers that you all sent.

21:40.064 --> 21:42.999
Unfortunately, because of
scooter's sugar allergies,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.836
He was not allowed to eat
the chocolate that you sent.

21:45.837 --> 21:49.673
Bet that didn't stop you
and your mom from scarfing
all that stuff down.

21:51.409 --> 21:54.144
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's have a warm welcome back

21:54.145 --> 21:57.581
For scooter -
the fully recovered turtle!

22:00.752 --> 22:04.254
Scooter! Scooter!

22:04.255 --> 22:05.822
Ah!

22:05.823 --> 22:08.392
I wonder if little scooter
remembers me.
Do you remember--

22:08.393 --> 22:10.527
<i>(crunch)</i>
ow! Ow!

22:12.930 --> 22:15.632
Obviously,
he does remember you.

22:15.633 --> 22:17.300
Ow! Ow!
Scooter, release.

22:17.301 --> 22:19.369
Oh!

22:24.375 --> 22:27.244
You know...

22:27.245 --> 22:29.679
What is your name?

22:29.680 --> 22:33.851
Bert! "early-bert dinner."

22:33.852 --> 22:38.255
I started to say "mark".
Ok.
Bert. As in ernie.

22:38.256 --> 22:41.759
You know, lately, judith,
it seems like you're always
interrupting me.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.827
No, I don't!
Well, do, do, do, do.

22:43.828 --> 22:46.529
You did just then.

22:54.004 --> 22:56.773
Are we still on?
<i>(director)</i> yeah.

22:56.774 --> 22:58.842
Was it a technical problem?
