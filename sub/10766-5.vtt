00:05.851 --> 00:07.842
Well, how do I look?

00:07.920 --> 00:10.320
Whoa, man.

00:13.992 --> 00:16.187
Y ou know that model
in all them Hugo Boss ads?

00:16.261 --> 00:18.627
- Y eah.
- Y ou don't look nothing like him.

00:20.499 --> 00:23.662
Y ou're just jealous
because the love of my life has returned.

00:23.735 --> 00:27.432
In Cindy, I have found the woman
I'd share the rest of my life with.

00:27.506 --> 00:30.373
Y ou've never even found a woman
you'd share a burrito with.

00:31.276 --> 00:34.871
<i>E</i> arth to Carlton,
but Cindy dumped you, man.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.505
She didn't dump me, Will.

00:36.582 --> 00:38.777
She was just working through
a fear of intimacy...

00:38.850 --> 00:42.684
caused by an overpowering father
and a narcissistic mother.

00:42.921 --> 00:45.048
Sure it wasn't your breath?

00:47.926 --> 00:51.589
Oh, look, <i>hors d'oeuvres.</i>
Isn't it great to be rich?

00:52.097 --> 00:53.894
Hands off. They're for Cindy.

00:54.266 --> 00:56.393
Cindy? Isn't she the one who dumped you?

00:57.703 --> 01:00.763
Carlton, why are you wearing a suit?

01:01.139 --> 01:03.664
Is Daddy bringing home white people?

01:05.242 --> 01:10.078
- No. Cindy's coming over.
- Cindy? I thought she dumped you.

01:11.149 --> 01:13.413
Okay, okay, she dumped me...

01:13.485 --> 01:15.885
but now that she's back,
I'm not gonna let her go.

01:15.954 --> 01:19.913
I'm gonna prove to her that I'm ready
for an adult, mature relationship.

01:21.226 --> 01:22.488
Door! Door! Door!

01:26.131 --> 01:28.861
All right, don't wet yourself. I'll get it.

01:32.070 --> 01:33.697
God, I'm a wreck.

01:35.707 --> 01:38.540
- Carlton.
- Cindy.

01:49.888 --> 01:53.016
I have something that belongs to you.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.962
Say hello to Daddy.

02:06.505 --> 02:07.836
<i>E</i> xcuse me.

03:18.944 --> 03:20.969
G, hurry up with that water, man.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.053
That's it. Carlton, wake up.

03:29.488 --> 03:31.319
Now, come on, man.

03:32.290 --> 03:34.724
Congratulations, man. He's a boy.

03:34.793 --> 03:36.920
Carlton, come on, man.

03:39.664 --> 03:41.791
Carlton, a father?

03:42.033 --> 03:45.799
He won't even let Ken and Barbie
sleep in the same shoebox.

03:46.638 --> 03:49.129
Y ou and Cindy? I mean, come on.

03:49.207 --> 03:52.404
Hey, the longest relationship
Carlton ever had was with last year's...

03:52.477 --> 03:55.037
<i>Ebony</i> swimsuit issue.

03:55.113 --> 03:59.345
This isn't a joke.
I mean, doesn't he look just like Carlton?

03:59.785 --> 04:02.447
Well, it looks like they wear the same size.

04:03.588 --> 04:06.250
- Can I hold him?
- Y eah, here you are.

04:09.060 --> 04:11.858
Oh, he is so cute.

04:12.063 --> 04:13.087
Oh!

04:15.033 --> 04:17.593
Get this drool machine away from me.

04:20.305 --> 04:21.704
Hey, can I?

04:22.674 --> 04:24.039
Thank you.

04:24.943 --> 04:26.467
What up, dude?

04:37.789 --> 04:41.350
Boy, when Mom and Dad see this,
somebody's gonna swing.

04:41.426 --> 04:44.054
Well, I can assure you, it won't be me.

04:44.729 --> 04:46.856
This time, the butler didn't do it...

04:48.834 --> 04:50.426
hasn't done it...

04:51.136 --> 04:54.731
and I'd be surprised
if he even remembered how to do it.

04:57.142 --> 05:00.805
Philip, I am never wearing a bathing suit
again, as long as I live.

05:00.879 --> 05:05.043
Now, honey, I'm sure the pool man
didn't really mistake you for me.

05:06.451 --> 05:08.385
He called me Mr. Banks.

05:09.621 --> 05:13.580
That's still no reason to hold his head
underwater, sweetheart.

05:15.227 --> 05:19.493
- I'll get you some antacid for that.
- No, don't. That wasn't me.

05:24.102 --> 05:25.433
Cindy.

05:26.037 --> 05:27.971
Mr. And Mrs. Banks.

05:28.340 --> 05:31.707
Hi, sweetheart. How long has it been?

05:31.776 --> 05:35.212
Well, I'd take a shot in the dark
and say around nine months.

05:37.749 --> 05:39.717
Whose is that?

05:39.784 --> 05:41.149
He's mine.

05:41.219 --> 05:44.848
Oh, my goodness. He's adorable.

05:45.223 --> 05:47.123
Come here, sweetheart.

05:47.192 --> 05:49.922
Oh, my. What's his name?

05:49.995 --> 05:51.326
Carlton.

05:55.767 --> 05:58.065
Oh, my God.

05:58.737 --> 06:01.672
Please tell me your father's first name
is Carlton.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.503
Sorry, wrong answer.

06:04.409 --> 06:07.435
Now, for those of you just tuning in
to <i>Name That Father...</i>

06:07.512 --> 06:10.345
this little bundle of joy belongs
to a young man...

06:10.415 --> 06:12.815
who's seen <i>Litt/e Mermaid</i> eight times.

06:14.552 --> 06:15.917
No.

06:17.422 --> 06:18.548
Carlton...

06:19.658 --> 06:21.023
are you the father?

06:22.160 --> 06:23.491
<i>E</i> xcuse me.

06:26.131 --> 06:27.996
Carlton. Carlton.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.767
- Carlton!
- Vivian. Honey, honey.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.064
Back off, Philip.
I am having a mother-son moment.

06:32.137 --> 06:36.471
- Carlton, how could you do this to us?
- Vivian, step away from the boy.

06:40.145 --> 06:43.478
Now, look, we're going to have to talk
about this in private.

06:43.548 --> 06:46.073
Not you, stupid. Sit your butt down.

06:47.986 --> 06:49.476
Hey, I'll take care of this, Uncle Phil.

06:49.554 --> 06:52.751
Okay, that's it. Move it along, party's over.
Nothing to see here.

06:53.124 --> 06:55.649
Come on. Pep it up, little grey man.

07:00.065 --> 07:02.499
Man, I thought they'd never leave.

07:03.635 --> 07:05.865
- Will.
- Phil.

07:07.706 --> 07:10.197
All right, I'm sorry. I'm just gonna...

07:10.742 --> 07:13.677
Look, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

07:15.380 --> 07:18.645
Sweetheart, you show up here with a baby
that you say is my son's...

07:18.717 --> 07:21.049
and you didn't mean to cause any trouble.

07:21.119 --> 07:23.644
Where do you think you are,
<i>Fantasy /s/and?</i>

07:23.722 --> 07:26.418
Watch out how you talk
to the mother of my son.

07:29.761 --> 07:30.819
Sir.

07:34.733 --> 07:36.963
Carlton, do you realize
what you're saying?

07:37.035 --> 07:39.367
He is Carlton's baby.

07:39.437 --> 07:41.496
I'll believe that when I see a blood test.

07:41.573 --> 07:44.804
It's the truth,
whether you want to believe it or not.

07:44.876 --> 07:46.400
I love Carlton.

07:47.145 --> 07:48.339
Really?

07:49.614 --> 07:50.706
Y es.

07:52.250 --> 07:55.048
And I'll tell you something else.

07:55.120 --> 07:59.682
Carlton is the most incredible lover
I have ever had.

07:59.758 --> 08:00.747
Oh, God.

08:03.328 --> 08:06.957
I mean, he's so in tune with my needs.

08:07.032 --> 08:09.899
It was amazing, and endless,
and magnificent.

08:10.468 --> 08:12.129
I think I saw God.

08:18.276 --> 08:20.540
The windows. I'm sorry.

08:21.212 --> 08:23.112
- I fell.
- We didn't mean to.

08:23.181 --> 08:24.375
I fell. I fell.

08:28.486 --> 08:30.716
Carlton, I am so disappointed in you.

08:32.424 --> 08:36.087
I mean, why didn't you come to us first?
Honey, we could have counseled you.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.356
Or at least had you neutered.

08:39.697 --> 08:41.357
Cindy, honey, I don't understand.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.459
If you knew this was Carlton's son,
why did you leave?

08:44.536 --> 08:47.198
Because I knew
that a baby could ruin his life...

08:47.272 --> 08:50.070
but I did feel
that he deserved to see his son...

08:50.141 --> 08:51.574
and that's why I came.

08:51.643 --> 08:54.407
Thank you for stopping by. Bye.

08:54.913 --> 08:56.210
Philip.

08:56.281 --> 08:59.250
Cindy, honey, I think we need to talk
to your parents about this.

08:59.317 --> 09:00.477
That won't do any good.

09:00.552 --> 09:02.747
They don't want to have anything
to do with me.

09:02.821 --> 09:05.949
They threw you out?
Where are you going to stay?

09:10.829 --> 09:11.818
Mommy?

09:12.130 --> 09:14.963
- Well, you could stay with us.
- No!

09:15.033 --> 09:17.763
At least, until after the blood test.

09:17.836 --> 09:20.304
- I couldn't impose.
- Oh, we understand.

09:20.371 --> 09:23.465
Y ou know,
I hear Ramada Inn has a wonderful pool.

09:23.541 --> 09:26.476
Cindy, please stay. We want you to, okay?

09:26.544 --> 09:28.808
Carlton will show you to the guest room...

09:28.880 --> 09:31.508
and there's no need to wake the baby.

09:43.862 --> 09:45.386
Y ou know...

09:45.463 --> 09:47.931
it's like the Rodney King videotape,
you know?

09:47.999 --> 09:51.696
I just keep seeing it over, and over,
and over again.

09:52.670 --> 09:56.766
And I ask myself,
where did I fail him, you know?

09:56.841 --> 09:58.706
Where did we go wrong?

10:11.856 --> 10:14.689
Hey, Mom, guess who?

10:15.093 --> 10:17.084
No, it's Will.

10:17.695 --> 10:18.923
Will Smith.

10:20.598 --> 10:24.796
Hey, yo, Mom, check it out.
It is some drama cutting loose out here.

10:26.638 --> 10:29.004
No, I'm not in trouble,
but, no, check it out.

10:29.073 --> 10:31.303
Somebody we know is a grandma.

10:32.010 --> 10:34.410
No, not you, Mom. Mom.

10:34.479 --> 10:38.313
No, Mom. Mom, stop crying.

10:38.383 --> 10:41.284
Stop crying. Mom, no, it's not me. It's...

10:41.386 --> 10:42.512
Carlton is the father.

10:43.888 --> 10:45.355
Stop laughing, Mom.

10:48.226 --> 10:52.492
Y eah, that will be a large pepperoni
with extra cheese.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.657
Right. I love you.

10:59.037 --> 11:01.972
That makes them bring it faster.

11:03.374 --> 11:04.898
Give me the phone, Will.

11:04.976 --> 11:07.308
This time Cindy's parents
are going to talk to me.

11:07.378 --> 11:10.609
Philip, honey, just be calm.
Now, I'm sure they're lovely people.

11:10.682 --> 11:12.582
Just because
they let their daughter run wild...

11:12.650 --> 11:16.609
and take advantage of our only son
and flush his life down the toilet...

11:16.688 --> 11:18.383
- Give me the damn phone, Philip.
- Vivian!

11:18.456 --> 11:20.947
Vivian, sweetheart, I'll handle it.

11:24.362 --> 11:27.627
Y es, hello.
Y eah, don't you dare try to hang up on me.

11:27.699 --> 11:29.223
What kind of lowlifes are you...

11:29.300 --> 11:32.497
throwing a minor out onto the street
and endangering a helpless infant?

11:32.570 --> 11:35.232
Well, I'm going to do everything I can
to see you behind bars.

11:35.306 --> 11:37.900
And what do you have to say for yourself?

11:42.113 --> 11:44.604
So when will your mommy and daddy
be home?

11:48.820 --> 11:50.913
Here we come, ready or not.

11:54.459 --> 11:58.088
Super, huh? Look, matching hats.

12:03.134 --> 12:06.570
I never knew having a family
could be so neat.

12:07.438 --> 12:10.737
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

12:14.078 --> 12:17.809
All right, whoa.
I'd like to take this opportunity...

12:17.882 --> 12:22.683
to bring it to everyone's attention that
Uncle Phil's head is about to explode...

12:23.621 --> 12:26.021
and, for once, it ain't my fault.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.088
Well, I think it's time
for little Carlton's nap.

12:32.897 --> 12:35.525
Y eah, it smells like you needs
to be changed, too.

12:38.836 --> 12:42.397
- I'll miss you, honey.
- Miss you, too.

12:45.710 --> 12:49.077
- Isn't she something?
- Y eah, she sure is...

12:49.147 --> 12:52.207
and Monday, after the blood test
proves the baby's not yours...

12:52.283 --> 12:55.514
she'll be out of here
on the first thing smoking.

12:56.554 --> 12:58.545
Dad, the baby's mine.

12:58.623 --> 13:01.251
Carlton, honey, suppose the baby is yours.

13:01.326 --> 13:04.921
Now, being a teenage parent
is a very big responsibility, honey...

13:04.996 --> 13:07.123
and you have already
proven yourself irresponsible...

13:07.198 --> 13:09.428
otherwise, you wouldn't be
in this situation.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.967
How are you going to feed this baby?

13:11.035 --> 13:13.868
Where are you going to live?
How are you going to educate it?

13:13.938 --> 13:17.465
Wait a minute. Y ou mean,
you're not going to take care of us?

13:18.609 --> 13:21.339
- Hold me back, Philip.
- Carlton, get out. Get out, now. Go.

13:21.846 --> 13:26.442
Hey, I got him, but take another step,
and I'll fill you full of potassium.

13:32.857 --> 13:35.587
Master William,
might I see you for a moment?

13:35.660 --> 13:37.059
Y eah, sure. What's up, G?

13:37.128 --> 13:42.031
Well, it's such a beautiful night.
I thought you might like to see the moon.

13:51.776 --> 13:54.244
Go easy on the poor little pinhead.

13:57.782 --> 14:00.615
Are you climbing down
Rapunzel's extensions?

14:02.320 --> 14:04.584
I don't want Mom and Dad to know.

14:04.655 --> 14:08.113
- To know what?
- Cindy and I are driving to Lompoc.

14:08.359 --> 14:13.023
No, Carlton, nobody drives to Lompoc.
Y ou drive through Lompoc.

14:13.097 --> 14:15.827
No, but there's a chapel. We're eloping.

14:16.167 --> 14:18.260
- What?
- No, Will, I don't want to hear it.

14:18.336 --> 14:20.702
I'm tired of everyone telling me
what to do.

14:20.772 --> 14:23.400
I love Cindy, and I've made up my mind.

14:25.676 --> 14:26.665
All right, man, fine.

14:26.744 --> 14:29.577
Look, whatever you want to do
is fine with me.

14:32.583 --> 14:33.675
What?

14:34.252 --> 14:36.618
I said, whatever you want to do
is fine with me.

14:36.687 --> 14:38.678
If you want to marry Cindy, go ahead.

14:38.756 --> 14:40.951
Just do me a favor. Sleep on it tonight.

14:41.025 --> 14:45.155
In the morning, if you feel the same way
then, whatever you want to do.

14:45.863 --> 14:47.854
- Deal?
- Deal.

14:48.533 --> 14:52.264
My man. Oh, give me your car keys.

14:53.037 --> 14:57.133
Y ou know, Will, I gave you my word.
I'd think that'd be enough.

14:57.208 --> 15:01.668
Y eah, you lucky I ain't going to do you
like Kunta Kinte and chop off your foot.

15:21.699 --> 15:25.191
- Y our cheesecake, sir.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.

15:25.269 --> 15:27.931
- Geoffrey, would you get Carlton, please?
- Certainly, sir.

15:28.005 --> 15:28.664
Thank you.

15:29.807 --> 15:32.935
Run, Geoffrey. Fetch, Geoffrey.

15:35.346 --> 15:38.315
Perhaps you'd like me to catch
a Frisbee in my teeth?

15:40.852 --> 15:43.286
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey, freeze!

15:43.354 --> 15:45.322
Just where have you been?

15:45.456 --> 15:48.448
- To the refrigerator.
- At this hour?

15:48.526 --> 15:50.221
It's 8:00.

15:50.294 --> 15:52.785
Philip, look at us.
We are really overreacting.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.765
This is Will.
There's no such thing as overreacting.

15:56.501 --> 15:58.230
- Frisk him.
- Whoa.

15:58.302 --> 16:01.430
Look, Adolph, <i>E</i> va,
why don't you all relax for a second.

16:04.575 --> 16:07.203
Geoffrey, where's Carlton?

16:07.411 --> 16:09.879
I'm sorry, sir, but he's not in his room...

16:09.947 --> 16:14.611
but the trip wasn't a total loss.
I found $1.25 under his bed.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.913
Who knew Christmas
would come twice this year?

16:19.490 --> 16:22.459
Geoffrey, did you check Cindy's room?

16:22.527 --> 16:25.121
The girl hasn't a penny to her name.

16:27.798 --> 16:30.824
Will, where's Carlton?

16:31.903 --> 16:35.430
I don't know, Uncle Phil.
Did you check the cracks in the couch?

16:35.773 --> 16:38.901
Will, you know something?

16:39.577 --> 16:41.636
Come on, Uncle Phil...

16:41.712 --> 16:44.704
does this look like the face of a dude
that knows something?

16:48.719 --> 16:50.653
He's got a point there, Vivian.

16:50.721 --> 16:52.586
Well, maybe we should call
Carlton's friends.

16:52.657 --> 16:55.387
That's a good idea.
I'll call one, you call the other.

17:04.435 --> 17:05.766
Number 52.

17:08.573 --> 17:11.303
Well, we're next, my little bride-to-be.

17:12.777 --> 17:14.142
Carlton...

17:14.579 --> 17:17.673
I hope you don't feel
like I pressured you into this.

17:17.748 --> 17:20.773
I mean, you are glad
we're getting married, right?

17:21.051 --> 17:22.040
Glad?

17:22.787 --> 17:26.415
Cindy, I've been in love with you
ever since the third grade.

17:26.490 --> 17:30.722
I mean, I used to go to sleep at night
and dream about the day we'd be married.

17:30.795 --> 17:33.559
- Do you really mean that, Carlton?
- Y es.

17:34.231 --> 17:36.665
We're going to have such a wonderful life.

17:36.734 --> 17:38.702
I mean,
we'll have to live in a trailer at first...

17:38.769 --> 17:42.170
but I'll get a job during the days,
and I'll work nights, too...

17:42.239 --> 17:45.140
as soon as I lick
that pesky fear of the dark thing.

17:46.277 --> 17:49.303
Well, you know, Carlton,
I was thinking that I would get a job, too.

17:49.380 --> 17:52.577
Don't worry about it.
No wife of mine is going to have to work.

17:52.650 --> 17:54.982
I mean, you can stay home
and take care of the kids.

17:55.052 --> 17:57.043
<i>E</i> xactly how many kids?

17:57.121 --> 17:59.817
Well, you know what they say,
eight is enough.

18:02.860 --> 18:04.828
Look, Carlton, I need to...

18:05.229 --> 18:08.027
- Would you watch the baby for a minute?
- Sure.

18:14.238 --> 18:16.706
Please, sweetie, please don't cry.

18:21.946 --> 18:25.507
Here comes little Mr. Ducky.
Doesn't he quack you up?

18:29.687 --> 18:30.745
Wow!

18:30.821 --> 18:34.313
If I could pass like that, they wouldn't
make me play on the girl's team.

18:39.196 --> 18:40.993
They'll throw us out.

19:08.659 --> 19:10.058
That's my boy.

19:14.832 --> 19:16.129
"And if there's anyone here...

19:16.200 --> 19:19.033
"who feels this couple
should not be joined in holy matrimony...

19:19.103 --> 19:21.469
"let them speak now
or forever hold their peace."

19:22.306 --> 19:25.503
Stop, man, don't do it!
Y ou don't even know if the baby is yours!

19:25.576 --> 19:29.808
- How did you know I'm having a baby?
- What? Y ou having a baby?

19:31.382 --> 19:35.785
Y o, hey, look, my fault.
Y ou all, see, my cousin was supposed...

19:36.554 --> 19:38.283
Hey, congratulations, man.

19:39.457 --> 19:41.254
So you're having his baby?

19:41.625 --> 19:44.594
What a wonderful way to say
how much I love you, huh?

19:46.263 --> 19:47.855
Y ou're too late, Will.

19:47.932 --> 19:50.594
Oh, man, you did it?
Tell me you didn't do it.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.570
God, please tell me you didn't marry her.

19:53.804 --> 19:55.396
I didn't marry her.

19:55.473 --> 19:57.338
Y es. Y ou the man.

19:59.009 --> 20:00.408
She left me.

20:00.478 --> 20:03.311
I got the feeling
she didn't want to live with me.

20:03.614 --> 20:06.913
- What made you think that?
- She said she didn't want to live with me.

20:08.786 --> 20:11.482
Oh, man, I mean, she can't just
walk out on you like that.

20:11.555 --> 20:14.115
- What if the kid is yours?
- He's not.

20:14.191 --> 20:16.250
Carlton, come on,
just because the baby is cute...

20:16.327 --> 20:18.488
doesn't mean you're not the father.

20:18.996 --> 20:20.930
I never slept with her.

20:23.734 --> 20:27.135
Look, since we're in a church,
I feel the need to confess something.

20:27.471 --> 20:30.929
Please don't laugh.
This is really hard for me to say.

20:31.342 --> 20:33.207
I'm a...

20:38.415 --> 20:39.882
y ou a German?

20:42.153 --> 20:43.245
No.

20:44.722 --> 20:46.246
I'm a virgin.

20:46.824 --> 20:47.916
What?

20:49.326 --> 20:50.793
I'm a virgin!

20:51.962 --> 20:54.590
It's nice to know somebody still is.

21:02.139 --> 21:06.576
Hey, look, Carlton, man,
I mean, I didn't know.

21:07.044 --> 21:10.707
I mean, hey, don't feel bad though.
I mean, a lot of guys are...

21:11.148 --> 21:12.843
you know, Germans.

21:14.819 --> 21:18.448
Will, I feel so unused.

21:18.889 --> 21:22.882
I mean, promise me you won't tell anyone.

21:23.093 --> 21:26.256
Hey, Carlton, come on, man,
you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.

21:26.330 --> 21:29.663
I mean, everybody talks about how much
pressure there is on girls to have sex.

21:29.733 --> 21:33.965
I mean, there's pressure on us, too.
That's why we lie about it.

21:34.038 --> 21:37.064
Y ou lie about it?
Y ou mean you're a virgin, too?

21:37.541 --> 21:41.068
Keep your voice down, man.
I ain't no virgin!

21:43.647 --> 21:44.636
Sorry.

21:46.050 --> 21:50.350
Hey, look, man, when it comes to me
and the honeys, I just say...

21:50.421 --> 21:52.252
no way. Y ucky.

21:56.293 --> 21:58.784
Will, I'm really gonna miss her.

21:58.929 --> 22:01.864
- Where did she go?
- Back to her parents.

22:01.932 --> 22:05.026
When she called and told them
she was going to marry me...

22:05.202 --> 22:06.897
they came and got her.

22:09.807 --> 22:13.436
Hey, look, Carlton, man,
they're wrong about you.

22:13.510 --> 22:15.671
Y ou're a great guy, man.

22:16.814 --> 22:20.113
Hey, look, come on.
Let's go home, so you can get in trouble.

22:23.187 --> 22:26.156
And don't worry about it, man. I mean...

22:26.223 --> 22:28.555
one day the right girl's
going to come along...

22:28.626 --> 22:31.754
and, I mean,
you won't be a German forever, you know?

22:32.663 --> 22:36.155
Good, 'cause I'm really looking forward
to losing my accent.

22:47.945 --> 22:50.243
Hey, don't you dare try to hang up on me.

22:50.314 --> 22:53.647
Now, who do you think you are?
What kind of lowlifes are you people...

22:53.717 --> 22:57.949
to throw a helpless minor out
onto the street with a helpless infant?

23:00.424 --> 23:02.415
I'll call you back.

23:02.493 --> 23:05.018
Who are you people,
to talk to my uncle like that...

23:05.095 --> 23:07.188
- with a helpless infant...
- Here we go.

23:07.264 --> 23:08.492
...and helpless actors?
- Okay.

23:08.565 --> 23:10.897
- <i>With a// these he/p/ess peop/e.</i>
- <i>Okay, here. This is it.</i>

23:10.968 --> 23:12.526
<i>Wi// somebody p/ease he/p us?</i>
