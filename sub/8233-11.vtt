00:02.033 --> 00:03.333
Previously on
Witches of East End...

00:03.366 --> 00:04.966
Ingrid's dead?
Freya, too.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.233
WENDY:
You need to complete the ritual

00:06.266 --> 00:07.866
to get my father here.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.833
He's the only one
powerful enough

00:09.866 --> 00:11.366
to bring the girls back.
(screaming)

00:11.400 --> 00:13.066
What do you mean, a "dark path"?

00:13.100 --> 00:15.566
INGRID: We killed a man
and covered it up.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.166
Was he covered in tar?

00:17.200 --> 00:18.966
It's thinner
than tar.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.866
Grandfather's here now.

00:20.900 --> 00:23.333
And we're lucky he is,
cause he saved your daughters.

00:23.366 --> 00:26.133
Your grandfather hasn't embraced
the family; it's all lies.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.700
We got to leave, this instant.

00:30.266 --> 00:32.000
I'm staying.

00:36.675 --> 00:38.209
FREYA:
Where the hell are we?

00:38.242 --> 00:40.742
JOANNA: Come on,
we don't have a lot of time.

00:40.775 --> 00:43.042
I can't believe
Ingrid stayed behind.

00:43.075 --> 00:44.809
JOANNA:
Oh, I can.

00:44.842 --> 00:46.875
The two of them always had
this strange connection.

00:46.909 --> 00:48.275
Father knows how
to push her buttons.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.309
This way.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.875
Wait, we need to go back
and get her.

00:52.909 --> 00:54.575
We can't, not
yet anyway.

00:54.609 --> 00:57.075
Is she gonna be okay?
Is he gonna hurt her?

00:57.109 --> 00:59.142
I can't believe that
he would have brought

00:59.175 --> 01:02.109
you both back just to harm you;
he obviously wants something.

01:02.142 --> 01:04.875
I just don't know what it is,
and I don't want to know.

01:04.909 --> 01:06.909
We have to stop this before
anyone else gets hurt,

01:06.942 --> 01:07.975
and that's why
we're here.

01:08.009 --> 01:09.642
Yeah, and where the hell are we?

01:09.675 --> 01:11.109
(laughs) Don't you mean
when the hell are we?

01:11.142 --> 01:14.109
(laughs) I wondered
who was gonna say that first.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.075
It's Baltimore.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.642
1848.

01:21.275 --> 01:22.875
NIKOLAUS:
Ingrid, you made

01:22.909 --> 01:25.409
the right decision
to stay here with me.

01:25.442 --> 01:28.242
I want to be clear;
I haven't made any decisions.

01:28.275 --> 01:29.309
Not yet.

01:29.342 --> 01:31.909
Then why did you stay behind?

01:31.942 --> 01:34.909
I haven't exactly been having
an easy time here.

01:36.609 --> 01:37.942
I think I'm lost.

01:37.975 --> 01:39.409
And I want to know why.

01:41.442 --> 01:44.609
And I'll give you
all the answers you seek.

01:44.642 --> 01:46.742
(groans) But first
I must rest.

01:46.775 --> 01:48.475
I'm still, uh...

01:48.509 --> 01:51.209
I'm still a little
weak from my journey.

01:51.242 --> 01:52.209
Are you all right?

01:52.242 --> 01:55.075
Well, the truth is...

01:55.109 --> 01:57.642
I won't be alive much longer.

01:57.675 --> 02:02.975
And this... new
vessel won't last.

02:03.009 --> 02:04.142
Thank you.

02:04.175 --> 02:06.375
Thank you for everything,

02:06.409 --> 02:09.475
my dear granddaughter.

02:10.742 --> 02:12.475
So, why are we here, anyways?

02:12.509 --> 02:16.242
I need to get a very rare,
very dangerous weapon.

02:16.275 --> 02:18.442
It may be the only
thing strong enough

02:18.475 --> 02:20.475
to kill your
grandfather for good.

02:20.509 --> 02:21.942
What makes you think
that's gonna work?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.509
Because a long time ago,
I used it to kill you.

02:36.175 --> 02:37.975
Excuse me,
Dr. Gardiner?
Yeah.

02:38.009 --> 02:39.909
There's someone here who'd
like to speak with you.

02:41.842 --> 02:43.475
Thank you.

02:43.509 --> 02:46.775
Dr. Gardiner, I'm
Special Agent Moreau.

02:46.809 --> 02:48.409
FBI.

02:48.442 --> 02:51.142
Can I have a few
minutes of your time?

02:51.175 --> 02:52.275
FBI?

02:52.309 --> 02:54.075
What are you
doing here?

02:54.109 --> 02:56.775
Investigating the murders that
have been happening in East End.

02:59.642 --> 03:01.742
Look, there
were multiple

03:01.775 --> 03:04.309
deep lacerations‐‐
down to the organs.

03:04.342 --> 03:05.875
Any consistent patterns?

03:05.909 --> 03:09.142
Yeah, but I've never
seen anything like it.

03:13.442 --> 03:14.309
Are you sure?

03:15.609 --> 03:17.075
Excuse me,
Agent Moreau?

03:17.109 --> 03:18.542
Chief Harris needs

dental molds

Floater? Someone drown?

03:28.075 --> 03:30.875
We found another body
washed up on the beach.

03:30.909 --> 03:32.375
We're not sure
of the cause of death,

03:32.409 --> 03:34.442
but we're not
ruling out homicide.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.875
That's terrible.

03:35.909 --> 03:38.875
Either way, I'll be in touch.

03:38.909 --> 03:40.442
Dr. Gardiner.

03:46.242 --> 03:48.042
Are you upset?

03:48.075 --> 03:49.809
No. Why would I be upset?

03:49.842 --> 03:53.042
Because we just time‐traveled
and I found out you murdered me?

03:53.075 --> 03:54.975
It wasn't like that.
Yeah, kind of was.

03:55.009 --> 03:57.442
I had a very
good reason.

03:57.475 --> 03:58.875
That's what
you always say.

you so much.

You promised!

05:17.642 --> 05:19.642
You said
no more opium.

05:19.675 --> 05:21.909
Since when did you become
such a busybody?

a shit about anything.

light and love,

I must confess, I fear
you're making a fool of me.

12:14.509 --> 12:15.909
And why is that?

12:15.942 --> 12:18.909
A carnival trick.

12:18.942 --> 12:21.609
Do you think my grief
has rendered me simpleminded?

12:21.642 --> 12:24.242
Perhaps you were simpleminded
to begin with.

12:26.109 --> 12:28.109
Let's see.

12:39.642 --> 12:42.242
You were born in Boston
but raised in Virginia.

12:42.275 --> 12:45.409
Henry was your older brother.

12:45.442 --> 12:48.975
Your mother passed away
when you were still an infant.

12:49.009 --> 12:51.075
And just one year ago,
you were court‐martialed

12:51.109 --> 12:52.609
from West Point.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.775
You could have learned
this information

12:56.809 --> 12:58.775
from a dozen different sources
this afternoon.

12:58.809 --> 13:01.809
You've made a modest living
writing poetry

13:01.842 --> 13:03.375
under a pseudonym.

13:03.409 --> 13:05.975
Yet you've recently decided
to focus on prose

13:06.009 --> 13:07.409
because it pays better.

13:07.442 --> 13:10.875
You privately wish
to publish your own magazine.

13:10.909 --> 13:12.309
And you wish to call it...

13:12.342 --> 13:14.642
The Stylus.

13:17.442 --> 13:19.909
Not much of a name,
if you ask me.

13:21.942 --> 13:24.609
This is information
no one in the world knows.

13:27.775 --> 13:30.409
Your fortune is
about to change.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.542
Success, wealth...

13:33.575 --> 13:36.042
and true love.

13:36.075 --> 13:39.309
All these will be yours.

13:39.342 --> 13:40.875
Tell me,

13:40.909 --> 13:44.742
when will this new life
of good fortune begin?

13:46.842 --> 13:49.809
(both panting)

13:49.842 --> 13:52.175
Are you sure
the cards predicted this?

13:53.742 --> 13:57.075
Or were you simply
reading my thoughts...

13:57.109 --> 14:00.375
and desires?

14:00.409 --> 14:03.875
No more than you
were reading mine.

14:03.909 --> 14:06.275
And what is your name,
my beautiful seer?

14:06.309 --> 14:08.309
Cassandra?

14:08.342 --> 14:10.242
Freya.

14:10.275 --> 14:11.609
And what is yours?

14:12.575 --> 14:15.909
Can you not tell me?

14:15.942 --> 14:18.009
No.

14:21.309 --> 14:23.042
It is Poe.

14:23.075 --> 14:24.442
Edgar Poe.

14:29.909 --> 14:31.775
FREYA: Wait, I was sleeping
with Edgar Allan Poe?

14:31.809 --> 14:34.575
Yep. It was actually one of
your more exciting lives.

14:34.609 --> 14:36.042
You weren't just
sleeping with him.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.209
You two were deeply in love.

14:38.242 --> 14:39.542
I almost failed
sophomore English

14:39.575 --> 14:41.242
because of
Edgar Allan Poe.

14:41.275 --> 14:43.975
And now you're telling me
I was in love with him?

14:44.009 --> 14:45.042
Desperately in love.

14:45.075 --> 14:46.542
You were his muse.

14:46.575 --> 14:49.109
And for a time,
you were very happy.

14:49.142 --> 14:51.775
"And neither the angels
in heaven above,

14:51.809 --> 14:54.875
"Nor the demons down
under the sea

14:54.909 --> 14:58.875
"Can ever dissever my soul
from the soul

14:58.909 --> 15:01.475
Of the beautiful
Annabel Lee."

15:01.509 --> 15:03.542
Ah, it's beautiful.

15:03.575 --> 15:06.642
I'm calling it "Annabel Lee,"
but of course,

15:06.675 --> 15:08.775
you and I will always know
it's about us.

15:08.809 --> 15:10.642
It's about us?

15:10.675 --> 15:12.275
That girl Annabel dies.

15:12.309 --> 15:14.409
The angels come out of
heaven and take her away.

15:16.609 --> 15:19.875
Their souls are connected
for eternity.

15:19.909 --> 15:23.609
Well, that's lovely,
but right now,

15:23.642 --> 15:25.842
I'm more interested
in our bodies connecting.

15:27.775 --> 15:31.942
Did I happen to mention I sold
a piece to the Evening Mirror?

15:31.975 --> 15:33.642
(gasps)
You did?

15:33.675 --> 15:34.875
And the Boston Review.

15:34.909 --> 15:36.409
Found out today.

15:36.442 --> 15:39.042
Well, you are on
quite a streak.

15:39.075 --> 15:40.442
Freya.

15:40.475 --> 15:42.109
You have opened my eyes

15:42.142 --> 15:45.642
to a world I thought only
existed in my imagination.

15:47.275 --> 15:49.575
A world I would have found
impossible to believe

15:49.609 --> 15:51.042
but for what
you have shown me.

15:51.075 --> 15:55.309
To think that I,
a writer of the fantastic,

15:55.342 --> 15:56.942
and you, a...
Shh!

15:56.975 --> 15:59.075
That's our secret.

15:59.109 --> 16:00.875
You must never say
that word out loud.

16:00.909 --> 16:03.242
Bad things will happen.

16:03.275 --> 16:05.575
You are so superstitious.

16:05.609 --> 16:09.075
And you're forgetting, I know
more about this than you do.

16:09.109 --> 16:13.075
And I want to learn everything
you can teach me.

16:13.109 --> 16:18.309
You are the most beautiful,
magical, enchanting creature

16:18.342 --> 16:20.609
ever to walk this earth.

16:23.509 --> 16:25.209
FREYA:
I broke the code?

16:25.242 --> 16:27.109
I told him we were witches?
Yep.

16:27.142 --> 16:28.475
You were in love.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.709
People who are in love
do stupid things.

16:30.742 --> 16:32.375
I know, I know.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.575
I broke the code last
week, and now we're here.

16:34.609 --> 16:35.875
Oh, wow.

16:35.909 --> 16:37.609
I'm so sorry, you guys.

16:37.642 --> 16:39.309
It's okay.

16:39.342 --> 16:42.642
You thought it would help
his writing, and it did.

16:42.675 --> 16:44.975
Where do you think he got
the idea for "The Black Cat"?

16:45.009 --> 16:47.575
All those
stories were...

16:47.609 --> 16:48.942
Based on us.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.242
Unfortunately,
after a few months,

16:51.275 --> 16:53.875
the creative well ran dry.

16:53.909 --> 16:56.242
And that's when
everything fell apart.

17:07.742 --> 17:09.742
What's wrong, my love?

17:09.775 --> 17:12.742
Mm.

17:12.775 --> 17:17.142
Your "love" is
a foolish, stupid man.

17:17.175 --> 17:19.175
(laughs)

17:22.609 --> 17:26.542
I've spent the advance on the
story I owe to Graham's Journal,

17:26.575 --> 17:28.075
and now I'm
seeking inspiration

17:28.109 --> 17:31.642
at the bottom
of this whiskey bottle.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.409
Shall I read
the cards?

17:34.442 --> 17:36.475
I already know
my future.

17:36.509 --> 17:40.609
It is that of the sun setting
into permanent night.

17:42.442 --> 17:43.909
Have you heard
of table‐turning?

17:43.942 --> 17:45.642
The parlor game?

17:45.675 --> 17:47.109
It is no game.

17:47.142 --> 17:49.909
Some people claim to hear
spirits of the dead.

17:49.942 --> 17:51.942
Let's try it
tomorrow night.

17:55.009 --> 17:58.209
And what might these spirits say
to inspire me?

17:58.242 --> 18:00.542
Who knows?

18:00.575 --> 18:01.942
But I bet it's
of more interest

18:01.975 --> 18:04.575
than what you're hearing
from that bottle.

18:04.609 --> 18:06.609
JOANNA:
You wanted to help,

18:06.642 --> 18:09.375
but you had no idea
the door you were opening.

18:09.409 --> 18:11.642
Darling, I'm not sure
we should go through with this.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.742
I want to use my gifts to
bring you inspiration, my love.

18:14.775 --> 18:16.675
And it may even be fun.

18:18.442 --> 18:19.909
Or dangerous.

18:19.942 --> 18:21.675
Danger can be fun.

18:25.175 --> 18:29.142
Spirits of the
afterlife, join us.

18:29.175 --> 18:34.442
Spiritus revelat,
veniat ad me.

18:38.975 --> 18:40.242
Should that be happening?

18:40.275 --> 18:42.909
That seems like a good sign.

18:42.942 --> 18:46.109
Spirits, if you are
here with us now,

18:46.142 --> 18:47.775
show yourselves.

18:47.809 --> 18:52.109
Ut dicas nobis.

18:54.275 --> 18:56.875
(whooshing)

18:56.909 --> 18:58.909
(groans)

19:06.909 --> 19:10.409
(demonic voice):
Why did you summon me?

19:11.975 --> 19:14.109
Freya?

19:14.142 --> 19:15.942
What is happening?

19:15.975 --> 19:17.542
I am not Freya.

19:17.575 --> 19:19.509
I am Ambrose Bancroft.

19:21.142 --> 19:24.275
Freya is a sinner,
and so are you.

19:24.309 --> 19:26.142
You should
be punished.

19:26.175 --> 19:28.509
I should send you to hell
with the others!

19:30.575 --> 19:32.409
I'm gonna find your sister.

19:33.442 --> 19:34.975
Who, Rose?

19:35.009 --> 19:36.175
No, Ingrid.

19:38.942 --> 19:41.242
I am going to kill Rose

19:41.275 --> 19:44.775
and put her in the trough
with pigs' food,

19:44.809 --> 19:47.875
so no one will
ever find her.

19:47.909 --> 19:50.909
Just like I did
to the other sinners!

19:50.942 --> 19:54.309
Spirit, I command you,

19:54.342 --> 19:56.109
be gone!

19:58.442 --> 19:59.609
Freya?

19:59.642 --> 20:01.442
Freya?

20:01.475 --> 20:02.875
(normal voice):
Did it work?

20:02.909 --> 20:05.575
Too well, I'm afraid.

20:05.609 --> 20:07.875
What happened?

20:07.909 --> 20:09.875
Nothing you need ever know.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.042
But I promise
you this‐‐

20:12.075 --> 20:15.342
we are never doing that again.

20:21.642 --> 20:23.409
FREDERICK:
Where are you going?

20:26.109 --> 20:27.775
The clock is ticking.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.609
Your mother has returned
to the past for a reason.

20:30.642 --> 20:35.142
But tonight, I intend
to find out why.

20:35.175 --> 20:36.875
Can't we just wait?

20:36.909 --> 20:39.642
You said yourself that
if they stay away too long...

20:39.675 --> 20:43.209
They'll die, horribly
and painfully.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.942
But I need to be prepared
for their return.

20:46.975 --> 20:50.609
Who knows what she
has planned for me?

20:50.642 --> 20:51.975
What are you
going to do?

20:52.009 --> 20:54.309
A spell.

20:54.342 --> 20:56.642
But I'll need a human.

20:56.675 --> 21:02.142
Someone to provide the,
uh... missing ingredient.

21:02.175 --> 21:05.975
Well, it shouldn't be a problem
to utilize this vessel.

21:06.009 --> 21:08.509
Oh, you chose wisely.

21:09.842 --> 21:12.242
I'm really going to enjoy this.

21:13.842 --> 21:15.842
♪ ♪

21:30.642 --> 21:32.109
Excuse me.

21:32.142 --> 21:33.875
Is anyone sitting there?

21:33.909 --> 21:35.375
You...

21:35.409 --> 21:36.909
if you buy me a drink.

21:36.942 --> 21:39.475
That's a deal.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.575
Agent Moreau.

21:42.609 --> 21:43.809
Dr. Gardiner.

21:43.842 --> 21:46.142
I have some
questions for you.

21:46.175 --> 21:48.275
Isn't it a little strange?

21:48.309 --> 21:50.642
Asking me questions
about a murder investigation

21:50.675 --> 21:52.142
in my home?

21:52.175 --> 21:53.942
At 11:00?

21:53.975 --> 21:56.209
Who says the questions
are about work?

21:56.242 --> 21:59.209
Oh, so this visit
is about pleasure.

21:59.242 --> 22:01.209
You just said

22:01.242 --> 22:03.442
the magic word.

22:03.475 --> 22:06.775
See, I'm having problems of a...

22:06.809 --> 22:10.375
personal nature, Doctor.

22:10.409 --> 22:13.142
Should I go get
my medical bag?

22:13.175 --> 22:15.075
I have this kink.

22:15.109 --> 22:17.142
And I can't seem
to get rid of it.

22:17.175 --> 22:19.042
What do you suggest that I do?

22:19.075 --> 22:22.442
Well... that
depends on where

22:22.475 --> 22:25.275
this kink is located.

22:25.309 --> 22:28.142
It's a little lower.

22:28.175 --> 22:30.609
Oh.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.242
How's that?

22:35.275 --> 22:37.675
(moans softly)

22:39.642 --> 22:40.975
WOMAN:
Not many guys I know

22:41.009 --> 22:43.975
would walk a girl home
from the bar.

22:44.009 --> 22:47.309
I'm definitely
not most guys.

22:47.342 --> 22:49.742
No.

22:49.775 --> 22:51.275
You're a gentleman.

22:51.309 --> 22:52.709
And an old soul.

22:52.742 --> 22:55.609
(laughs) It's funny
you should say that.

22:55.642 --> 22:58.675
I've never felt younger.

23:03.109 --> 23:04.575
We can take this
back to my apartment.

23:04.609 --> 23:06.142
My roommate won't mind.

23:06.175 --> 23:08.509
That won't be
necessary, my darling.

23:16.909 --> 23:20.209
You really are lovely.

23:20.242 --> 23:23.309
But the ritual I
need to perform

23:23.342 --> 23:25.909
requires a beating heart.

23:32.909 --> 23:34.875
(whistling)
FREDERICK:
You've been gone for hours.

23:37.051 --> 23:39.117
What happened?

23:39.151 --> 23:42.017
Oh, just enjoying
a lovely night

23:42.051 --> 23:44.451
among the citizens
of East End.

23:44.484 --> 23:46.808
By the way, I know
exactly where Joanna,

23:46.841 --> 23:48.441
Wendy and Freya are.

23:48.475 --> 23:49.708
How?

23:49.741 --> 23:51.941
It would appear my
beating heart ritual

23:51.975 --> 23:54.441
works with
mortals as well.

23:54.475 --> 23:55.808
And what's that?

23:55.841 --> 23:57.141
INGRID:
Grandfather?

23:57.175 --> 23:59.175
Frederick?
Grandfather?

23:59.208 --> 24:02.341
(panting)

24:02.375 --> 24:04.541
Are you all right?

24:06.408 --> 24:09.208
Oh, I'm fine. I...

24:09.241 --> 24:12.475
But I'm more
concerned about you.

24:12.508 --> 24:15.075
I want to help you.

24:17.141 --> 24:19.708
You and I
were once so close.

24:19.741 --> 24:21.475
I understand you.

24:21.508 --> 24:23.375
You don't even know me.

24:23.408 --> 24:25.175
Oh, I know your soul.

24:25.208 --> 24:28.308
That's the only part of you
that doesn't change.

24:28.341 --> 24:33.641
And I know how much
you're struggling here.

24:33.675 --> 24:34.875
And you always will be.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.008
The problem is

24:36.041 --> 24:39.308
magic has no place

24:39.341 --> 24:41.275
in this world.

24:41.308 --> 24:45.175
Neither do any of you.

24:45.208 --> 24:46.775
FREYA: If Edgar drove out
Ambrose's spirit,

24:46.808 --> 24:48.108
I was okay, right?

24:48.141 --> 24:51.641
JOANNA:
Uh, well, not exactly.

24:55.075 --> 24:56.108
(gasps)

24:56.141 --> 24:58.341
Oh, you frightened me.

24:58.375 --> 24:59.708
Pardon me, miss.

24:59.741 --> 25:02.008
Just making my way home.

25:04.008 --> 25:05.808
(demonic voice):
Only a sinner would be

25:05.841 --> 25:09.108
walking the streets
at this late hour.

25:09.141 --> 25:12.275
That's what you are, Rose.

25:12.308 --> 25:15.541
Just a common street‐walker.

25:15.575 --> 25:17.441
No, I'm not.

25:17.475 --> 25:20.008
What are you doing?

25:20.041 --> 25:22.541
Sending you to hell,
dear sister.

25:29.541 --> 25:31.808
I need to talk to
you about Freya.

25:31.841 --> 25:33.008
Where is she?

25:33.041 --> 25:34.641
She hasn't been
to work in days.

25:34.675 --> 25:37.175
That is what I must
discuss with you.

25:37.208 --> 25:40.508
We held a séance
Sunday night.

25:40.541 --> 25:41.975
Something
came over her.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.508
What? What do you mean?

25:43.541 --> 25:44.708
Did you summon a spirit?

25:44.741 --> 25:47.775
Yes, yes.

25:47.808 --> 25:49.841
It seemed to
enter her body.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.008
It spoke through her.
It was evil and dark.

25:52.041 --> 25:55.441
A‐A man who claimed he had
murdered before and would again.

25:55.475 --> 25:58.541
I don't think the spirit left.

25:58.575 --> 26:01.475
This is exactly why we don't
reveal ourselves to mortals.

26:01.508 --> 26:02.641
It only brings trouble.

26:05.541 --> 26:08.541
Hey. Scoot!

26:10.541 --> 26:12.341
You should have come
to me sooner, Edgar.

26:12.375 --> 26:13.841
I know.

26:13.875 --> 26:15.541
I know, just...
at first I wasn't sure.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.175
Three people have been strangled
in the last three days.

26:18.208 --> 26:20.375
It's all over the newspaper;
the city's in a panic.

26:20.408 --> 26:22.441
If I had known Freya might
be involved in this...

26:22.475 --> 26:24.041
I just didn't
want to believe

26:24.075 --> 26:26.341
she could be capable
of such a thing.
It's not her.

26:26.375 --> 26:28.175
It's whatever evil spirit
you summoned.
I know.

26:28.208 --> 26:29.708
I'm so sorry. I should
have never let this happen.

26:29.741 --> 26:31.275
I'll deal with it.

26:31.308 --> 26:34.941
I'll find Freya, hopefully
before she kills again,

26:34.975 --> 26:36.841
and I'll drive
the evil spirit out of her.

26:36.875 --> 26:39.341
I'm coming with you.

26:39.375 --> 26:40.808
You most certainly
are not.

26:40.841 --> 26:42.508
You should not have
to do this alone.

26:42.541 --> 26:44.608
What about Joanna?
Can't she help?

26:44.641 --> 26:46.508
Joanna isn't equipped to
deal with this right now.

26:46.541 --> 26:48.808
And I'm not gonna put
you in danger, Ingrid.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.041
You two stay here.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.575
I'll take care of it.

26:57.208 --> 27:00.508
The poison will burn you as if
your soul is being incinerated.

27:00.541 --> 27:01.941
But you will
be free.

27:01.975 --> 27:04.575
The curse will be scraped
from your soul.

27:06.675 --> 27:08.208
There's no antidote, Killian.

27:09.475 --> 27:10.808
No turning back.

27:10.841 --> 27:12.208
I know.

27:13.475 --> 27:16.008
MATTHIAS:
Go home and drink this.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.175
Get in bed.

27:17.208 --> 27:19.441
You will go to sleep.

27:19.475 --> 27:21.508
It will all be over by tomorrow.

27:29.241 --> 27:30.608
Thank you.

27:30.641 --> 27:32.141
Thank you.

27:33.875 --> 27:36.208
Look, I don't know you.

27:36.241 --> 27:39.041
I don't know the woman
you're doing this for.

27:39.075 --> 27:42.941
But come on, there must be
other things to live for.

27:42.975 --> 27:44.541
Other women.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.508
Not for me. There's only Freya.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.541
When I found out she was
dead, I knew right then

27:48.575 --> 27:50.041
I couldn't live
without her.

27:50.075 --> 27:54.008
If there's a chance
that we can be together,

27:54.041 --> 27:55.775
I have to take it.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.108
Doesn't matter
what happens to me now.

27:58.141 --> 28:01.175
No one has ever loved me
like you love her.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.941
I just hope
she's worth it.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.975
She is.

28:10.408 --> 28:11.508
Freya?

28:11.541 --> 28:13.608
Ambrose?

28:13.641 --> 28:16.041
Show yourself.
We need to talk.

28:17.375 --> 28:20.708
I know you're here.
I can feel you.

28:22.975 --> 28:24.708
(speaking Latin)

28:32.375 --> 28:35.708
(demonic voice): Time to face
your divine judgment, Rose.

28:37.708 --> 28:39.975
Good‐bye, Rose.

28:41.975 --> 28:43.175
(neck snaps)

28:51.975 --> 28:55.175
Wendy! Wendy!

28:55.208 --> 28:56.608
No!

28:56.641 --> 28:59.175
Sana... Sana...

28:59.208 --> 29:02.375
Freya, what have you done?!

29:02.408 --> 29:04.775
Sana...

29:04.808 --> 29:05.875
Mother?

29:05.908 --> 29:07.008
Mother, please.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.141
Please wake up.

29:08.175 --> 29:10.341
I need your help.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.508
Please.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.008
Mom.
Ingrid.

29:14.041 --> 29:16.341
Mother, something terrible
has happened.

29:16.375 --> 29:18.108
Freya...

29:18.141 --> 29:19.541
What happened?

29:19.575 --> 29:21.541
Freya and Poe
conjured a spirit,

29:21.575 --> 29:23.041
a very dark spirit,

29:23.075 --> 29:25.675
and it's taken
possession of Freya.

29:25.708 --> 29:27.308
What are you
talking about?

29:27.341 --> 29:30.108
She killed Aunt Wendy.

29:30.141 --> 29:33.308
(laughs)
I don't believe you.

29:33.341 --> 29:34.441
This isn't happening.

29:34.475 --> 29:35.808
This is a dream.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.141
This is not a dream!

29:37.175 --> 29:39.341
This is not
the opium talking.

29:39.375 --> 29:41.775
We need your help.

29:41.808 --> 29:42.841
We have to stop Freya.

29:42.875 --> 29:44.375
We have to stop her

29:44.408 --> 29:46.275
before the spirit inside of her
kills anyone else.

29:46.308 --> 29:48.341
Listen to me!
I... I can't...

29:48.375 --> 29:49.441
We need you!

29:49.475 --> 29:51.741
I can't help
you, Ingrid.

29:52.741 --> 29:54.675
I can't.

29:57.341 --> 29:59.341
But...

30:01.841 --> 30:05.475
I know someone who can.

30:17.075 --> 30:19.941
This...

30:19.975 --> 30:22.875
is the Anima Aucupe.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.941
Will it work?

30:24.975 --> 30:26.975
Do you have the elixir?

30:31.041 --> 30:33.741
How?

30:40.975 --> 30:44.908
Auferte malum spiritus...

30:50.741 --> 30:54.641
When a possessing spirit
looks inside this box,

30:54.675 --> 30:57.208
it will be ripped
from its host body

30:57.241 --> 30:59.008
and sent straight to hell.

30:59.041 --> 31:01.108
What about the host body?

31:01.141 --> 31:03.941
CRAFTSMAN:
The Anima Aucupe

31:03.975 --> 31:05.375
kills both the spirit

31:05.408 --> 31:07.875
and the host.

31:07.908 --> 31:09.675
It's the only way.

31:11.341 --> 31:13.675
But that means Freya...

31:13.708 --> 31:15.341
She can't be saved.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.208
I am sorry.

31:28.141 --> 31:30.308
INGRID: You have to go
through with this.

31:30.341 --> 31:31.341
Ingrid...

31:31.375 --> 31:32.508
I know.

31:32.541 --> 31:36.375
If Freya dies, I'll die, too.

31:36.408 --> 31:38.041
But I'll be reborn.

31:39.075 --> 31:42.375
You won't remember.

31:42.408 --> 31:44.341
You won't be this you.

31:44.375 --> 31:45.608
I know.

31:45.641 --> 31:48.008
We don't have
a choice.

31:50.975 --> 31:52.975
Ingrid, I
know that...

31:53.008 --> 31:54.941
since your father
left, I...

31:54.975 --> 31:58.508
I haven't been
myself, and...

31:58.541 --> 31:59.875
It's okay, Mother.

31:59.908 --> 32:02.341
I understand.

32:02.375 --> 32:05.708
But maybe if I had
been well, then...

32:05.741 --> 32:08.141
I could have prevented
this somehow.

32:08.175 --> 32:10.941
It's not your fault.

32:10.975 --> 32:13.541
Mother, Freya is
a grown woman.

32:13.575 --> 32:16.875
She made a choice,
and so am I.

32:16.908 --> 32:18.175
Let me do this.

32:18.208 --> 32:20.475
Please.
You can't.

32:20.508 --> 32:23.441
We will all have
another chance.

32:23.475 --> 32:27.775
But if I do this,
you have to stop.

32:27.808 --> 32:29.441
Freya and I need you.

32:29.475 --> 32:30.675
(sighs)

32:30.708 --> 32:32.508
We will need you back.

34:52.841 --> 34:53.975
I can do it.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.541
I know you want
your family

34:55.575 --> 34:58.441
back together
in Asgard.

34:58.475 --> 35:00.975
And you shall have it.

35:02.641 --> 35:04.475
I don't want anyone

No.

35:09.075 --> 35:11.841
And she needs
to be stopped.

35:11.875 --> 35:14.875
And you are not the
right man for the job,

35:14.908 --> 35:17.808
as you have proven

35:17.841 --> 35:19.941
time and time again.

35:19.975 --> 35:22.641
Thank you for freeing me,
Your Grace.

35:22.675 --> 35:24.375
How can I be of service?

35:24.408 --> 35:26.341
It seems that Ingrid

35:26.375 --> 35:28.641
has made her decision
to join us,

35:28.675 --> 35:30.608
which is very
good news.

35:30.641 --> 35:31.941
Congratulations.

35:31.975 --> 35:34.475
Mmm.

35:34.508 --> 35:36.608
And now it's time
for you to prove

35:36.641 --> 35:37.841
your worthiness.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.475
I'm sending you

35:39.508 --> 35:40.908
on a little trip.

35:53.175 --> 35:54.375
Run a test.

35:54.408 --> 35:55.875
See if this is the same stuff

35:55.908 --> 35:57.875
we found on the floater
at the beach.

35:57.908 --> 35:59.975
(knocking)

36:05.708 --> 36:07.375
Ingrid. I‐I thought you were...

36:07.408 --> 36:10.041
Dead. Yeah. I was.

36:10.075 --> 36:12.208
Wh...

36:13.875 --> 36:15.875
Wow. I can't believe this.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.275
What happened?

36:17.308 --> 36:19.341
The short version:
my grandfather

36:19.375 --> 36:21.808
came back from Asgard after
Freya and I were murdered,

36:21.841 --> 36:23.308
and brought us
back to life.

36:23.341 --> 36:25.308
I'm probably gonna
need the long version.

36:25.341 --> 36:28.475
So, wait, your‐your grandfather
from Asgard?

36:28.508 --> 36:30.375
That's where
we're all from, Dash.

36:30.408 --> 36:31.841
You, too. And Killian.

36:31.875 --> 36:33.808
So is Freya alive, too?
Yes.

36:33.841 --> 36:35.775
Oh, God, I... this is crazy.
I've got to call Killian.

36:35.808 --> 36:38.108
He was a mess when he found out.
He's got to know she's okay.

36:38.141 --> 36:39.708
Dash, we have way
bigger problems.

36:39.741 --> 36:41.441
Look, I know this is a lot
to take in all at once,

36:41.475 --> 36:42.841
but I really need your help.

36:42.875 --> 36:44.108
Ingrid, whatever it is...

36:44.141 --> 36:46.475
My mother, Freya and
Wendy are in hiding.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.441
My grandfather is
extremely powerful,

36:48.475 --> 36:49.841
but he's faking
being ill,

36:49.875 --> 36:51.708
and I know he has
something awful planned.

36:51.741 --> 36:53.608
Luckily, he believes
I'm on his side,

36:53.641 --> 36:55.475
which is exactly what
I want him to think.

36:55.508 --> 36:56.708
He trusts me now.

36:56.741 --> 36:59.008
But I'm going to
stop him, Dash,

36:59.041 --> 37:01.975
and I need your help.

this will bring Freya here?

This spell shall work

38:44.802 --> 38:46.736
(gasps)
Oh...

38:49.469 --> 38:50.702
(screams)

38:50.736 --> 38:51.369
(gasps)

38:51.402 --> 38:54.269
Freya.

38:54.302 --> 38:57.069
(demonic voice):
Freya isn't here.

38:57.102 --> 39:00.702
Freya... is dead.

39:00.736 --> 39:02.369
What have you
done with Freya?

39:02.402 --> 39:06.302
I have sent her
to her final judgment.

39:06.336 --> 39:08.336
I don't believe you.

39:10.069 --> 39:13.102
Freya, it's me.

39:13.136 --> 39:14.602
It's your mother.

39:14.636 --> 39:15.902
(exhales)

39:15.936 --> 39:17.869
The mother.

39:17.902 --> 39:19.969
Freya never loved you.

39:20.002 --> 39:21.536
You're pathetic.

39:21.569 --> 39:23.869
Opium‐smoking whore!
INGRID: Fight him,

39:23.902 --> 39:24.869
Freya.

39:24.902 --> 39:26.236
You are stronger than he is.

39:26.269 --> 39:27.236
Fight him!

39:27.269 --> 39:28.536
She can't fight me!

39:28.569 --> 39:31.636
Your daughter is
in the Underworld!

39:31.669 --> 39:33.802
Which is where you're going,
you son of a bitch!

39:33.836 --> 39:35.602
(whooshing)

39:37.769 --> 39:40.169
(screams)

39:42.069 --> 39:43.302
Freya.

39:45.802 --> 39:46.802
Oh.

39:48.269 --> 39:51.036
My sweet Freya.

39:51.069 --> 39:54.769
I'm so sorry.

39:54.802 --> 39:56.469
Please forgive me.

39:58.902 --> 40:00.802
(crying)

40:00.836 --> 40:02.102
I love you.

40:05.102 --> 40:06.802
WENDY:
I know, Freya.

40:06.836 --> 40:08.302
Pretty weird, right?

40:08.336 --> 40:10.302
It's not every day
your mom actually kills you.

40:10.336 --> 40:13.802
I kind of don't blame you.

40:13.836 --> 40:16.602
Oh, I'm so glad to
hear you say that.

40:18.802 --> 40:21.269
Seeing you possessed by
the spirit of Ambrose Bancroft

40:21.302 --> 40:22.769
was one of the strangest,

40:22.802 --> 40:24.769
most horrible things
I've ever seen.

40:27.902 --> 40:31.269
But it was nothing
compared to what happened next.

40:32.569 --> 40:34.902
My God.

40:34.936 --> 40:37.736
Is it a shifter?

40:40.002 --> 40:43.202
No, hon.

40:43.236 --> 40:45.602
It's me.

40:52.269 --> 40:54.769
I need the
Anima Aucupe.

41:02.636 --> 41:04.669
Thank you.

41:11.069 --> 41:14.769
JOANNA: So at midnight tonight,
all of this will happen,

41:14.802 --> 41:17.802
because it's already happened.

41:17.836 --> 41:21.769
I've carried that memory
for over 150 years,

41:21.802 --> 41:23.869
and I never knew
when or why,

41:23.902 --> 41:26.802
just someday, I would
go back in time

41:26.836 --> 41:28.236
and complete
the circle.

41:28.269 --> 41:30.236
How are we gonna do that?

41:30.269 --> 41:32.602
We're gonna wait
for me to kill you.

41:32.636 --> 41:34.602
Then I'm gonna get

41:34.636 --> 41:36.636
the Anima Aucupe,
so we can return to East End

41:36.669 --> 41:38.402
and send your grandfather
straight to hell.
