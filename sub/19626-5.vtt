00:07.974 --> 00:10.343
Mm. Vegetarian. Thank you.

00:11.711 --> 00:12.915
Shall we?

00:13.479 --> 00:15.147
A weekend meeting off book?

00:15.181 --> 00:16.915
What do you need, Tracy?

00:16.949 --> 00:18.950
What if I were to tell you
a conglomerate of bankers

00:18.985 --> 00:21.019
are about to take down the economy.

00:21.054 --> 00:25.157
That the Dow, NASDAQ, long
bonds are all about to drop 80%

00:25.191 --> 00:27.440
in the blink of an eye? Total collapse.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.860
Panic on the streets.

00:28.895 --> 00:30.529
Law and order in flames.

00:30.563 --> 00:31.863
And by the way,

00:31.898 --> 00:34.533
almost certainly the
end of this President.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.102
What if I told you the person
who wrote the code for that has,

00:37.136 --> 00:39.953
at the last second, decided
to sell to the highest bidder?

00:40.073 --> 00:41.873
Well, then my guess
would be that someone

00:41.908 --> 00:44.624
in the Attorney General's
office made that bid.

00:44.744 --> 00:45.767
You?

00:46.512 --> 00:50.048
For the code plus the
full list of conspirators.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.616
I need it to brief the President.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.218
No. Not yet.

00:53.252 --> 00:55.721
Just you and I on this until
I announce the indictments.

00:55.755 --> 00:58.523
Tracy, I can't not
brief her. It's my job.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.659
Let me stop you there for a second.

01:02.667 --> 01:05.997
Pretty sure there's some details
of what you and your people do

01:06.032 --> 01:08.425
that you don't disclose
to the President.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.570
You're the Associate Attorney General

01:11.604 --> 01:13.071
of the United States.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.840
What the hell are you doing?

01:19.270 --> 01:21.847
[Sighs] What possible
reason could you have

01:21.881 --> 01:24.664
- to force my hand on this?
- That was the Chief of Staff

01:24.784 --> 01:26.585
to the Secretary of Defense who,

01:26.619 --> 01:29.087
if I'm not mistaken, you
left dead on a Park Bench

01:29.122 --> 01:31.188
with a bullet in his chest.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.226
Come judgment day,

01:34.260 --> 01:36.228
who pays for all your sins, Christina?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.720
This guy?

01:38.598 --> 01:40.198
Bryan Mills.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.839
Seller's code name is Midas.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.841
Of course it is.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.958
<i>- What kind of package?
- Portable. That's all I know.</i>

01:59.819 --> 02:01.186
Per Midas' instructions,

02:01.220 --> 02:03.255
Mills will be at the
Brungasi drinking fountain

02:03.289 --> 02:05.791
<i>unarmed, no phone, nothing.</i>

02:05.825 --> 02:09.997
<i>He will wear a white t-shirt,
blue shorts, red running shoes.</i>

02:10.118 --> 02:13.231
<i>Midas will know who he is.
He will not know who Midas is.</i>

02:13.266 --> 02:15.815
- What does he look like?
- No idea.

02:15.935 --> 02:19.179
Our communications have only
ever been via encrypted email.

02:19.839 --> 02:23.642
Midas will approach if and
when he feels it's safe.

02:23.676 --> 02:26.711
<i>If he does not feel safe in
any way, the deal is off.</i>

02:26.746 --> 02:28.747
So Mills needs to be alone.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.287
<i>This has a bad smell to it, Tracy.</i>

02:35.321 --> 02:37.704

you know what you're doing</i>
