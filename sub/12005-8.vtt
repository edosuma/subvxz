00:01.756 --> 00:03.943
_

00:03.944 --> 00:06.186
_

00:06.189 --> 00:08.323
I believe with my whole self

00:08.357 --> 00:11.392
that there is a God, but
you don't share it with me.

00:11.426 --> 00:14.199
It's just gonna hurt us even
more if we don't end it now.

00:14.233 --> 00:16.444
No, he seems like a good
person. I can't really...

00:16.478 --> 00:19.193
can't really say the
same thing about... her.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.397
Toby: Oh, my dad's opponent?

00:26.229 --> 00:28.098
Elisa!

00:28.132 --> 00:30.036
- Hi.
- Get dressed.

00:30.070 --> 00:33.038
- Both of you.
- Your mom is Patricia Sawyer.

00:34.142 --> 00:37.178
I really do like you. It was fun.

00:37.212 --> 00:40.381
And if I don't balance my budget,
then there is no more Carlton.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.950
Two glasses of bubbly, please.

00:45.989 --> 00:49.190
I'm not feeling very well. I
just need to crawl into bed.

00:55.035 --> 01:00.037
_

01:00.038 --> 01:06.540
_

01:12.744 --> 01:15.680
Hark! Who knocketh upon my door?

01:17.016 --> 01:18.983
Maybe I have the wrong house.

01:19.018 --> 01:21.988
I have Shakespeare on the brain.
I'm trying to learn my lines.

01:23.957 --> 01:26.525
- What's up?
- Is Regina here?

01:26.559 --> 01:28.593
Nope, she's out running errands.

01:28.628 --> 01:30.862
You could try her cellphone.
Do you want some tea?

01:30.897 --> 01:32.931
No thanks. Uh...

01:32.965 --> 01:35.867
actually wanted to talk to you.

01:37.570 --> 01:39.437
Have you noticed

01:39.472 --> 01:41.906
anything different about your mom?

01:42.941 --> 01:44.675
What do you mean?

01:45.811 --> 01:48.679
I'm just wondering if it's possible...

01:48.714 --> 01:51.482
if maybe she's...

01:51.517 --> 01:53.452
started drinking again.

01:53.486 --> 01:56.421
What are you talking about?

01:56.456 --> 02:00.326
The other night she came home in a cab...

02:00.360 --> 02:02.662
Her car broke down.

02:02.696 --> 02:05.665
But she was walking and she
was talking kind of stiff,

02:05.699 --> 02:09.167
like when you're trying to
act like you're not drunk.

02:09.202 --> 02:13.439
And I know that things have been
really stressful lately for her,

02:13.473 --> 02:16.409
with her hands and looking for a job

02:16.443 --> 02:18.578
and the whole Angelo and Lana thing.

02:26.220 --> 02:29.389
Did you know that my mom and
I lived in our car for a week

02:29.423 --> 02:32.259
when I was in first grade?

02:32.293 --> 02:35.129
I had strep throat and
she used the rent money

02:35.163 --> 02:38.366
to take me to the doctor
and buy antibiotics.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.167
Do you know what she didn't do?

02:40.202 --> 02:43.304
- Drink.
- Trust me,

02:43.339 --> 02:47.975
the Angelo drama and the
problems with her hands

02:48.010 --> 02:51.012
- are not worse than that.
- And you're not worried

02:51.046 --> 02:54.883
that seeing this jazz-club
guy from the old days mi...

02:54.917 --> 02:57.986
If my mom was drinking, I'd know about it.

There's this French film
that Angelo told me about.

03:27.918 --> 03:30.753
It's playing at that
little theater by U.M.K.C.

03:30.787 --> 03:32.822
- Mmm, subtitles?
- Okay, that's a "no."

03:32.856 --> 03:34.824
Oh yeah! We could go A.T.V.Lng.

03:34.858 --> 03:36.159
There's a field behind my house.

03:36.193 --> 03:39.029
My parents already had one
lawsuit. Best not make it two.

03:39.063 --> 03:41.999
Okay. Scotty McCreery.

03:42.033 --> 03:44.101
- He's playing at the Palladium.
- Cool!

03:44.135 --> 03:45.802
Who is he again?

03:45.837 --> 03:47.837
The country singer? "American Idol"?

03:47.872 --> 03:49.806
You know what? We'll keep trying.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.108
Oh, how "Downton Abbey" of you!

03:52.143 --> 03:54.144
- Huh?
- Never mind.

05:58.069 --> 05:59.803
There she is. Will you make sure

05:59.838 --> 06:01.639
- everybody keeps working?
- Yeah.

06:01.673 --> 06:05.042
I am so sorry I'm late.
There was this chem lab and...

06:05.077 --> 06:07.878
It's okay. Can I talk to you for a second?

06:09.848 --> 06:13.016
- Yeah.
- I've had to do

06:13.051 --> 06:15.919
a bit of re-shuffling in the cast.

06:15.953 --> 06:19.790
Amy dropped out and I think

06:19.824 --> 06:22.726
you'd be the best person
to take over her part.

06:23.928 --> 06:26.130
- Juliet?
- Juliet.

06:26.164 --> 06:28.032
I barely learned the nurse.

06:28.066 --> 06:30.801
I'm not even taking drama.

06:30.835 --> 06:32.836
But you picked it up so fast

06:32.870 --> 06:35.839
- and you're so good.
- Hey hey, so sorry.

06:35.874 --> 06:37.942
There was this chem-lab thing.

06:39.811 --> 06:41.745
Did I miss anything?

06:49.091 --> 06:51.385
_

06:51.386 --> 06:52.901
_

06:52.902 --> 06:55.052

_

07:28.426 --> 07:30.097
_

07:38.070 --> 07:40.838
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:40.872 --> 07:44.042
I just drove by one of
your billboards for John.

07:44.076 --> 07:46.945
- It's amazing.
- Amazing enough to get your vote?

07:46.979 --> 07:50.081
Amazing enough to get me to abstain.

07:50.116 --> 07:53.051
Hey, do you guys have any aspirin
over here? We just ran out.

07:53.085 --> 07:54.719
Still feeling sick?

07:54.753 --> 07:56.988
The other night when
you came home in the cab?

07:57.022 --> 07:59.858
- You said you weren't feeling well.
- Right. Um...

07:59.892 --> 08:02.861
I thought it was food poisoning,
but I guess it's like a viral thing.

08:02.895 --> 08:03.662
Thanks.

08:03.663 --> 08:05.929
So when do Daphne and I
get to meet your new guy?

08:05.932 --> 08:08.700
Zane? I don't know. He
works a lot of nights.

08:08.735 --> 08:10.970
We could come down to the
club, have a little dinner.

08:11.004 --> 08:14.073
It's pretty loud in there. Not
really the best place to meet anybody.

08:14.108 --> 08:16.109
It wasn't that bad when
we went with Angelo.

08:16.143 --> 08:20.714
- Is Zane working this weekend?
- Why don't I see if he can come on over for dinner?

08:20.748 --> 08:23.083
And you can invite your new guy.

08:23.117 --> 08:25.685
Sounds great. I'll ask Noah.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.654
Great. Thanks.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.929
Come in and then we go back out.

08:35.964 --> 08:37.898
And we come in. Yeah, okay.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.868
"Then move not while my
prayer's effect I take.

08:40.903 --> 08:44.806
Thus from my lips, by
yours, my sin is purged."

08:44.841 --> 08:46.708
And then we kiss.

08:54.150 --> 08:56.685
And we kiss again.

08:56.719 --> 08:58.086
"Sin from thy lips."

09:00.723 --> 09:02.958
You have a step down right behind you.

09:02.992 --> 09:05.861
- Oh. Sorry?
- You have a step down.

09:05.895 --> 09:08.897
- You're gonna be on a platform.
- Oh, right. Thanks.

09:08.932 --> 09:12.735
- Okay.
- So the nurse comes in

09:12.769 --> 09:14.737
and tells me that my mom is looking for me.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.005
- So I go off with her.
- Right, and then

09:17.040 --> 09:18.941
I find out that

09:18.975 --> 09:21.009
your mom's a Capulet.

09:21.044 --> 09:23.745
So then I turn to Benvolio,

09:23.780 --> 09:25.847
"blah blah blah."

09:26.849 --> 09:28.683
And then you leave.

09:31.887 --> 09:33.688
Hey.

09:33.722 --> 09:36.591
- You leave.
- Oh right.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.893
Sorry. Okay.

09:38.927 --> 09:40.795
Want to do that again?

09:40.829 --> 09:43.698
Have you ever thought
about getting a hearing aid?

09:43.732 --> 09:46.534
I have one, but I...

09:46.568 --> 09:47.902
I don't really need it.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.874
- Well, a lot of kids here...
- I'm fine.

09:52.908 --> 09:55.677
Can we get back to this?

09:55.711 --> 09:56.745
Sure.

09:57.780 --> 09:59.747
Okay.

09:59.782 --> 10:02.417
And turn.

10:02.451 --> 10:04.552
Come back.

10:04.587 --> 10:07.322
Then we go out. And then we come back.

10:08.424 --> 10:10.625
Wow, that's a nice guitar. A Fender, right?

10:10.660 --> 10:13.395
- Do you play?
- No. 

10:13.429 --> 10:15.531
I, uh... I went through
this phase in middle school

10:15.565 --> 10:18.467
where I wanted to be in a
band, so my mom got me a guitar.

10:18.501 --> 10:21.270
- A... a Fender?
- Uh... Gibson.

10:21.304 --> 10:23.339
It was a Gibson, yeah.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.607
Way to buy your love.

10:24.641 --> 10:27.476
Yep, pretty much.

10:27.510 --> 10:30.412
It's in the garage along
with all my other phases.

10:30.447 --> 10:33.349
So what kind of phase are you in right now?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.551
I'm not sure.

10:35.585 --> 10:37.286
I'm not sure, I'm...

10:37.320 --> 10:41.390
I'm waiting to see what
catches my interest.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.161
You know, I...

10:45.195 --> 10:47.063
I thought that, um...

10:47.097 --> 10:50.366
I thought after the way that you
left my house the other day...

10:50.401 --> 10:52.401
Yeah, sorry. That was... that was weird.

10:52.436 --> 10:54.336
- Yeah. A little weird.
- Yeah.

10:54.371 --> 10:57.973
- That was really bad.
- Sorry, I was... I was still...

10:58.007 --> 11:00.108
processing the whole thing.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.209
You know.

11:03.378 --> 11:05.246
Is your mom still mad?

11:05.280 --> 11:08.049
I don't know. Probably.

11:08.083 --> 11:10.919
I don't care. 

11:10.953 --> 11:12.854
I don't care.

11:12.888 --> 11:15.223
In a few months I will be touring Greece.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.192
- Greece?
- Yeah!

11:17.226 --> 11:20.862
And I cannot wait to get out of this town

11:20.897 --> 11:22.965
and see the birthplace of democracy.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.835
- Yeah.
- That's very educated of you.

11:25.869 --> 11:27.804
Well.

11:27.838 --> 11:29.872
And I'm gonna take a guess that

11:29.906 --> 11:32.775
the Greek islands don't
really suck either, you know?

11:32.809 --> 11:35.778
The Mediterranean and the white sand,

11:35.812 --> 11:38.781
nude beaches.

11:38.815 --> 11:42.884
You might just have to come join me.

11:43.529 --> 11:44.852
Well, I am a big fan of democracy.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.338
I have a date suggestion that
I think you're gonna like.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.975
- Excellent.
- It involves food...

13:58.983 --> 14:00.704
- Well, I like food.
- ... And me...

14:00.738 --> 14:03.006
- Even better.
- ... And an evening

14:03.041 --> 14:06.643
with a real live jazz musician.

14:06.678 --> 14:09.513
Okay, that could be cool. When and where?

14:09.547 --> 14:12.548
Tonight. Dinner with my bio-mom,

14:12.583 --> 14:15.718
her new boyfriend... the jazz musician...

14:15.752 --> 14:17.753
- And Daphne.
- Wow.

14:17.788 --> 14:19.688
Don't freak out or anything.

14:19.723 --> 14:21.690
I'm not putting you on display.

14:21.724 --> 14:24.893
It's kind of the reverse actually.
I'm putting Regina's boyfriend

14:24.928 --> 14:27.863
- to the test.
- Okay, what does that mean?

14:27.897 --> 14:30.365
Nothing.

14:30.399 --> 14:31.733
I'll see you tonight.

14:37.639 --> 14:39.541
I'm sorry I'm late.

14:39.575 --> 14:42.310
Salad, as you requested.

14:42.345 --> 14:44.546
- Took me no time to make it.
- My kind of chef.

14:44.581 --> 14:47.650
Bay, this is Zane; Zane, Bay.

14:47.684 --> 14:50.286
- I can see the resemblance.
- Yeah.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.687
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14:51.721 --> 14:54.390
Oh... bottle of vino.

14:54.424 --> 14:56.125
Not necessary.

14:56.159 --> 14:57.526
I'll take your coat

14:57.561 --> 14:59.495
and you can meet Noah and Daphne.

14:59.529 --> 15:01.564
- Thank you. Hey, guys, how are you doing?
- Good.

15:01.598 --> 15:04.066
- Zane. Nice to meet you.
- Noah.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.268
- Hi, I'm Daphne.
- Daphne, how you doing? Zane.

15:06.302 --> 15:08.237
- Daphne: Nice to meet you.
- Zane: Nice to meet you.

15:08.271 --> 15:12.308
Drop this off with Sean. He's
the big tall guy back there, okay?

15:12.342 --> 15:13.462
Patricia!

15:14.263 --> 15:16.345
When you're done signing
those fundraising letters,

15:16.346 --> 15:18.414
I have a stack you can
sign back at my office.

15:18.449 --> 15:21.384
I'd be happy to do that, as long
as I get to keep all the money.

15:21.419 --> 15:25.121
So what brings you to enemy territory?

15:25.156 --> 15:27.123
It's actually a personal matter.

15:27.158 --> 15:29.325
I found your son with my daughter

15:29.360 --> 15:31.995
in our hot tub a few days ago.

15:32.029 --> 15:34.865
Toby? I don't think so.
Toby's got a girlfriend.

15:34.899 --> 15:38.001
Well, that doesn't change
the fact they were together.

15:38.035 --> 15:40.103
- And you're sure it was Toby?
- Oh yeah.

15:40.137 --> 15:43.239
Elisa couldn't wait to tell me who he was.

15:43.274 --> 15:46.843
- It doesn't sound like him.
- Nobody knows better than I do

15:46.877 --> 15:49.597
the toll these campaigns can take
on a family. Just ask my ex-husband.

15:49.598 --> 15:50.584
Mmm.

15:50.585 --> 15:53.817
Maybe this was our kids'
way of getting our attention.

15:53.852 --> 15:57.822
Mm-hmm. Well, parenting almost
makes the campaign look easy, huh?

15:57.856 --> 16:00.058
Of course once I win,
you'll have plenty of time

16:00.092 --> 16:02.694
to work on your father-son relationship.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.763
See you around.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.600
So wait... he's a deaf drummer?

16:09.529 --> 16:11.697
I need to jam with this
guy. What's his name again?

16:11.731 --> 16:14.433
- Ladies: Emmett.
- You know what we should do?

16:14.467 --> 16:17.503
In August there's this jazz festival
called "Listen with your eyes."

16:17.537 --> 16:19.772
- "Listen with your eyes"?
- Yeah, because with jazz

16:19.806 --> 16:22.440
you don't just listen with your
ears. You listen with your body.

16:22.475 --> 16:24.876
- You... you... you see the music.
- I love that.

16:24.910 --> 16:29.414
- It's cool, right?
- So what's the biggest change you've noticed

16:29.448 --> 16:31.749
about Regina? You know, since you guys

16:31.783 --> 16:34.718
have met up again after all these years?

16:34.753 --> 16:37.554
"All these years"? You make
it sound like a lifetime.

16:37.589 --> 16:41.358
No, it kind of was. We
were both married, had kids.

16:41.393 --> 16:44.495
I guess what surprised me the most

16:44.530 --> 16:46.731
was how little she changed.

16:46.765 --> 16:48.633
- Regina: Aw.
- Nice one.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.536
Really?

16:51.570 --> 16:54.405
She hasn't changed?

16:54.440 --> 16:58.543
Well, other than being older and
wiser and a lot more sensible.

16:58.578 --> 17:00.646
At first it was kinda
like dating Cinderella...

17:00.680 --> 17:04.516
she was always slipping out of the
club, trying to get home by midnight.

17:05.585 --> 17:08.453
"At first"? What about now?

17:10.356 --> 17:12.357
Can you help me with dessert please?

17:15.627 --> 17:17.429
Dinner was great. Thank you.

17:18.175 --> 17:20.059
_

17:20.060 --> 17:21.888
_

17:22.680 --> 17:24.540
_

17:24.541 --> 17:28.990
_

17:28.991 --> 17:32.542
_

17:32.543 --> 17:35.914
_

17:38.387 --> 17:40.354
Dr. Who? Who's Dr. Who?

17:40.389 --> 17:42.323
It's a TV show. Daphne loves it.

17:42.357 --> 17:46.194
It's about this guy, right?
He's called the doctor

17:46.228 --> 17:48.096
and he's this time lord.

17:48.130 --> 17:51.199
I'm sorry... where are you from?
'Cause I keep hearing a little accent.

17:51.233 --> 17:53.335
- Sorry? What was that?
- There it is again.

17:53.369 --> 17:56.037
- He doesn't have an accent.
- He's asking where you're from.

17:56.071 --> 17:59.340
- Noah: Oh.
- His mom is from Canada.

17:59.375 --> 18:03.245
- Really?
- Which explains,

18:03.279 --> 18:07.315
but does not excuse, your
horrible taste in basketball teams.

18:07.350 --> 18:09.985
Come on. The Raptors are rebuilding, okay?

18:10.019 --> 18:12.354
That's just a euphemism for
"they're gonna suck again."

18:12.388 --> 18:15.324
- Pfft!
- Not to get all technical,

18:15.358 --> 18:17.426
but wouldn't the Raptors

18:17.461 --> 18:21.965
- bite, not suck?
- She makes a good point.

18:21.999 --> 18:25.301
Oh damn, I've got to get back to the club.

18:25.336 --> 18:27.037
Wait, I thought you
weren't playing tonight.

18:27.071 --> 18:29.173
No, Mitch wanted me to
sit in at the last minute.

18:29.207 --> 18:31.275
Hey, you should come with me.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.312
Um-mm...

18:34.346 --> 18:37.882
well, I mean, maybe just one set.

18:37.916 --> 18:40.117
You know what? You guys
just leave the plates.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.354
- I'll clean it up when I get home.
- Why don't we all go?

18:43.389 --> 18:46.057
It would be cool to see you play.

18:46.091 --> 18:48.160
Huh-uh. School night.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.028
Give me a sec. I'll get my jacket.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.330
Okay.

18:51.364 --> 18:56.035
Since you're here, do you mind
going over the nightingale scene?

18:56.069 --> 18:58.170
Kathryn wants me off book by tomorrow.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.006
Yeah yeah yeah, sure. Umm...

19:00.040 --> 19:03.109
- Is that cool?
- Sure. Happy rehearsing.

19:05.012 --> 19:07.213
- It was nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

19:07.248 --> 19:09.983
- You're the man, Zane.
- All right, take care, man.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.993
Look, tell you what... I will
get you into next weekend's gig

19:20.028 --> 19:22.929
if you promise to show me

19:22.964 --> 19:24.932
some of your artwork.

19:24.966 --> 19:27.735
Uh, sure. My studio's downstairs,

19:27.769 --> 19:29.002
so stop by any time.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.071
You should probably take that with you.

19:31.105 --> 19:34.141
Oh no, it's okay, I'll just leave
it here. It's your mom's favorite.

19:34.176 --> 19:36.811
I'm all set.

19:36.845 --> 19:37.812
Bye.

19:37.846 --> 19:40.916
- Nice to meet you.
- Have fun.

19:47.214 --> 19:50.901
_

19:50.902 --> 19:53.953
Because, I... I don't know how to.

19:53.987 --> 19:56.154
I mean, she's my mom,

19:56.189 --> 19:58.389
but she's not my mom. 

19:58.424 --> 20:00.125
And maybe there's part of me

20:00.159 --> 20:03.094
that doesn't want to know.

20:03.129 --> 20:06.197
I mean, what if she is drinking again

20:06.231 --> 20:10.068
and my parents find out? I
don't know what they're gonna do.

20:10.102 --> 20:13.871
I mean, what if they try
to get custody of Daphne,

20:13.906 --> 20:16.107
or they tell me that I
can't see her anymore?

20:16.108 --> 20:22.990
_

20:24.356 --> 20:31.553
_

20:32.597 --> 20:38.023
_

20:38.964 --> 20:41.164
Yeah, maybe.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.771
Kathryn: Ah.

20:48.806 --> 20:52.041
Hey. What's going on?

20:53.538 --> 20:55.930
_

20:55.931 --> 20:58.714
"We're leaving soon. We
just needed a place to work."

20:58.748 --> 21:01.116
Well, what are the signs for?

21:03.153 --> 21:06.989
"We have a meeting with the
school board this afternoon.

21:07.023 --> 21:10.659
A lot of the kids are coming with me.

21:10.694 --> 21:13.629
So maybe you need to... "

21:15.031 --> 21:16.898
So...

21:18.067 --> 21:21.036
Are you saying "cancel rehearsal"?!

21:25.975 --> 21:28.844
I think we're building
something really great here.

21:28.878 --> 21:31.913
Hearing and deaf kids working together?

21:31.948 --> 21:34.850
I don't understand

21:34.884 --> 21:37.953
why you don't think we can coexist.

21:41.809 --> 21:43.208
_

21:43.210 --> 21:45.695
You're about to explain
it to the school board.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.602
"This is a deaf school.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.839
Where we can be seen.

21:55.873 --> 21:59.576
But the world doesn't recognize us."

22:00.945 --> 22:03.813
That's not true of all hearing people.

22:03.848 --> 22:06.716
I recognize you.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.620
"That's nice."

22:11.822 --> 22:13.790
But I'm here because I'm a parent.

22:13.824 --> 22:16.693
Actually, I'm here

22:16.727 --> 22:19.762
because you can't afford

22:19.797 --> 22:22.432
a drama teacher.

22:22.466 --> 22:26.370
And the hearing program can help you

22:26.404 --> 22:28.805
by bringing in more money.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.675
What's so bad about more
money for the school?

22:46.557 --> 22:50.527
"At a hearing school, deaf students
will always be on the outside.

22:51.629 --> 22:53.596
They enter the cafeteria for lunch,

22:53.630 --> 22:55.498
they'll look around,

22:55.532 --> 22:59.368
see... 20 different conversations,

22:59.403 --> 23:01.270
none of which they can be a part of.

23:02.606 --> 23:04.406
But here they're free,

23:05.675 --> 23:08.276
not to be 'the deaf kid, '

23:09.378 --> 23:10.445
but to be themselves.

23:11.614 --> 23:14.216
That's what I'm fighting for.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.451
And if you can't see

23:16.486 --> 23:18.454
why that's more important than your play

23:18.488 --> 23:21.190
or anything else,

23:21.225 --> 23:24.227
then I don't know what else to tell you.

23:30.469 --> 23:32.236
The bus is here."

23:33.076 --> 23:34.209
_

23:43.767 --> 23:45.202
_

23:55.194 --> 23:57.062
Thank you.

23:59.232 --> 24:01.333
Okay, everybody,

24:01.368 --> 24:03.302
let's start with...

24:03.336 --> 24:06.172
scene four, act two.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.349
I can't.

24:19.119 --> 24:21.354
I have to be there.

24:21.388 --> 24:23.356
- I'm sorry.
- Da...

24:49.661 --> 24:51.159
_

24:53.743 --> 24:55.929
_

25:01.134 --> 25:04.455
_

25:13.722 --> 25:18.489
_

25:20.462 --> 25:22.634
_

25:22.635 --> 25:26.632
_

25:27.277 --> 25:30.977
_

25:33.823 --> 25:37.644
_

25:37.645 --> 25:39.591
_

25:39.592 --> 25:41.433
_

25:43.533 --> 25:47.058
_

25:47.059 --> 25:50.002
_

26:03.440 --> 26:05.419
_

26:16.734 --> 26:19.602
So you couldn't have used our hot tub?

26:19.636 --> 26:21.537
There wasn't a girl in our hot tub.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.639
I didn't know that it was
Patricia Sawyer's house.

26:25.674 --> 26:27.841
Or Patricia Sawyer's daughter,

26:27.876 --> 26:29.676
but obviously she knew who you were.

26:29.711 --> 26:31.944
Dad, it was two people in a jacuzzi,

26:31.979 --> 26:34.447
- not a conspiracy.
- Mm-hmm.

26:34.481 --> 26:37.482
- What about Nikki?
- She broke up with me...

26:37.517 --> 26:38.917
on Valentine's Day.

26:38.951 --> 26:41.786
I... I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

26:43.856 --> 26:46.624
Look, Toby, I get how

26:46.659 --> 26:49.728
having an attractive girl pay
attention to you could help you get...

26:49.762 --> 26:51.630
That is not why I did it!

26:54.701 --> 26:57.802
I don't know Elisa. I'm
sure she's a nice kid.

26:57.837 --> 26:59.804
But I question her judgment.

27:02.341 --> 27:04.709
Well, she did volunteer
to help out your campaign.

27:07.580 --> 27:10.315
Maybe she likes me because I'm me,

27:10.349 --> 27:13.285
- not because I'm your son.
- That's not what I meant.

27:13.319 --> 27:16.488
So this has nothing to
do with your campaign?

27:16.523 --> 27:19.258
- You're just worried about me?
- Hey.

27:19.292 --> 27:21.727
You just make sure whatever you do,

27:21.761 --> 27:24.697
you do it for the right reasons

27:24.731 --> 27:27.299
- and with the right person.
- Got it.

27:30.737 --> 27:33.472
It was so funny.

27:33.507 --> 27:36.475
It was crazy.

27:38.612 --> 27:39.678
Hey!

27:41.314 --> 27:43.182
So you looking for some inspiration

27:43.216 --> 27:45.350
or you here to learn about some jazz?

27:45.385 --> 27:48.353
Uh... no. I actually wanted
to talk to you about Regina.

27:48.388 --> 27:50.422
Is everything okay?

27:52.292 --> 27:54.529
When you guys are together, do you...

27:54.563 --> 27:57.267
well, has she...

27:57.302 --> 27:59.170
ever had a drink?

27:59.204 --> 28:02.107
You mean like a glass of wine or something?

28:02.142 --> 28:05.177
- Yeah.
- Yeah, why?

28:08.181 --> 28:10.182
Regina's an alcoholic.

28:12.552 --> 28:15.220
And she didn't tell you.

28:15.255 --> 28:16.489
No.

28:25.065 --> 28:26.466
No.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.975
Do you need a ride home or something?

28:35.009 --> 28:36.209
No, it's okay.

28:36.244 --> 28:38.445
Uh, thanks.

28:44.119 --> 28:47.221
"You say that the deaf
students will just 'adjust, '

28:47.255 --> 28:50.024
but what you mean is they'll just

28:50.059 --> 28:52.060
get used to second-class status."

28:52.094 --> 28:56.999
We realize that this is
not an ideal situation.

28:57.033 --> 28:59.935
"You are compromising the
quality of their education."

28:59.969 --> 29:02.972
Have any of you ever
actually been to Carlton?

29:03.006 --> 29:05.308
We've been to every district school,

29:05.342 --> 29:09.011
and I'm sorry but we're not opening the
floor to anyone who's not on our agenda.

29:09.046 --> 29:11.981
You're making a decision that
affects over 100 deaf students,

29:12.016 --> 29:14.918
and you don't have time
to listen to one of them?

29:16.087 --> 29:17.153
Step forward.

29:24.896 --> 29:28.765
Carlton is the one place in the world

29:28.799 --> 29:31.034
where having ears that
don't work doesn't matter.

29:32.904 --> 29:35.772
It's not just a school to us,

29:35.807 --> 29:37.775
it's our home.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.878
And by letting more hearing kids in,

29:40.912 --> 29:43.080
you're saying it's okay to invade our home.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.982
But it's not.

29:53.992 --> 29:55.860
Okay.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.063
Honey, in a perfect world,

29:58.097 --> 30:01.700
we'd have money for deaf
schools and organic lunches

30:01.735 --> 30:04.737
and state-of-the-art computer
labs in all our schools.

30:04.771 --> 30:06.840
But we don't.

30:06.874 --> 30:09.909
We're stretched incredibly thin these days.

30:09.944 --> 30:14.013
You found money to hire the college
football coach at Jefferson...

30:14.048 --> 30:17.750
 ... And resurface the track at Taft.

30:18.986 --> 30:21.888
I guess it just comes
down to how you prioritize.

30:40.574 --> 30:42.575
Hello.

30:43.844 --> 30:47.547
- You're back.
- I texted you.

30:47.581 --> 30:51.384
I saw. After rehearsal.

30:53.420 --> 30:55.455
I know that you don't understand...

30:55.489 --> 30:58.592
No, I don't.

31:01.529 --> 31:03.597
I'll be at rehearsal tomorrow.

31:04.799 --> 31:06.433
Great.

31:13.541 --> 31:15.709
At least your dad didn't tell
you that you couldn't see me.

31:15.743 --> 31:18.445
My mom grounded me... allegedly.

31:18.479 --> 31:20.514
We see how well that's working out.

31:22.616 --> 31:26.685
- Hey, how much was all this?
- No, please, don't worry about it.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.655
- No, come on, please.
- I put it on my mom's card. It's fine, stop.

31:29.689 --> 31:32.324
It's on the house...

31:32.358 --> 31:34.526
Patricia Sawyer's house that is.

31:39.265 --> 31:43.302
Are you saving up for all
your travels and stuff or...

31:43.337 --> 31:46.640
If by "saving up" you mean "the
occasional A.T.M. withdrawal

31:46.674 --> 31:50.443
because my mom hasn't changed
her pin since 2004," then yes.

31:50.478 --> 31:53.146
Yes. What? Don't... come on.

31:53.180 --> 31:55.415
Don't give me that look.
I've seen your house.

31:55.450 --> 31:59.086
Don't pretend like you
don't also dip into the well,

31:59.120 --> 32:01.388
- if you know what I mean.
- Well, I mean, I've...

32:01.423 --> 32:04.157
definitely done my fair
share of stupid stuff,

32:04.192 --> 32:06.193
but, you know,

32:06.228 --> 32:08.196
I've never taken from them.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.532
It's just compensation

32:10.566 --> 32:13.235
for emotional abuse.

32:18.106 --> 32:21.042
I'm sorry I missed rehearsal yesterday.

32:21.076 --> 32:23.244
Yeah, I heard about the meeting.

32:23.278 --> 32:25.446
Is everything okay?

32:25.480 --> 32:28.315
I don't know. The school
board's voting today

32:28.349 --> 32:30.251
for what happens next year.

32:30.285 --> 32:35.256
Hmm, whether I stay or go.

32:36.392 --> 32:39.160
It's okay. I get it, you know.

32:39.195 --> 32:43.030
You don't want the Replicants taking over.

32:43.065 --> 32:45.433
Hey, check me out.

32:45.467 --> 32:48.069
- What?
- Look.

32:48.103 --> 32:51.105
Mmm, did you get a new haircut?

32:51.140 --> 32:53.107
Are you trying to grow sideburns?

32:53.141 --> 32:55.076
New backpack?

33:01.259 --> 33:03.656
_

33:09.480 --> 33:12.860
_

33:13.882 --> 33:15.438
_

33:18.415 --> 33:21.681
_

33:23.490 --> 33:24.876
_

33:24.877 --> 33:28.670
_

33:30.390 --> 33:33.775
_

33:33.776 --> 33:34.704
_

33:34.705 --> 33:38.762
- _
- _

33:38.763 --> 33:41.066
_

33:43.357 --> 33:48.337
_

33:48.338 --> 33:51.919
_

33:58.851 --> 34:02.618
_

34:04.503 --> 34:09.302
_

34:10.588 --> 34:12.388
_

34:14.659 --> 34:16.348
_

34:22.665 --> 34:23.965
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:26.001 --> 34:28.768
Chardonnay please. Oh. 

34:28.803 --> 34:31.001
I feel like my eyes are gonna pop out.

34:31.034 --> 34:34.569
I spent all afternoon
online, looking at want ads

34:34.603 --> 34:36.737
and filling out job applications.

34:36.773 --> 34:38.607
Thanks.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.743
I was thinking that maybe I should...

34:40.777 --> 34:42.878
Are you sure you want that?

34:42.911 --> 34:45.614
Why?

34:45.648 --> 34:47.849
Look, Bay came by this afternoon,

34:47.884 --> 34:49.885
and she said,

34:49.918 --> 34:52.388
you know, you and alcohol...

34:53.489 --> 34:55.591
you're not supposed to be drinking.

34:57.627 --> 35:00.429
Look, Regina, I am not judging you.

35:00.463 --> 35:02.464
I love hanging out with you,

35:02.499 --> 35:04.667
but I don't want to mess things
up and be a bad influence.

35:04.701 --> 35:08.771
You... you are not messing anything up.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.807
Th... this is just a misunderstanding.

35:10.841 --> 35:13.710
I'll call you later. 

35:15.446 --> 35:16.680
- Reggie...
- I'm good.

35:23.362 --> 35:25.296
What the hell did you think you were doing?

35:25.331 --> 35:27.298
- Sneaking into the jazz club...
- I wasn't sneaking.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.534
Talking to Zane behind my
back? Telling him I'm a drunk?

35:29.568 --> 35:31.336
- I didn't tell him that.
- Why didn't you come to me?

35:31.370 --> 35:34.339
- Because I wasn't sure so...
- So you decided to ruin

35:34.373 --> 35:37.575
the one bright spot in my
otherwise crappy life right now?

35:37.610 --> 35:39.511
- I was just trying to help.
- Help?

35:39.545 --> 35:42.346
Who the hell do you think
you are? You don't know me.

35:42.381 --> 35:44.548
- I'm sorry, Regina...
- Who else did you tell?

35:44.583 --> 35:47.218
- Daphne? Your parents?
- No.

35:47.252 --> 35:49.420
- Did you call my mom in Puerto Rico?
- No.

35:49.455 --> 35:52.123
Stay out of my business, okay?

35:52.157 --> 35:54.159
You stay out of it.

36:18.546 --> 36:20.347
You made it.

36:20.381 --> 36:22.349
Sorry I'm late.

36:22.384 --> 36:26.051
We were waiting to hear
the school board's vote.

36:27.320 --> 36:31.222
Daphne, I know you're upset,

36:31.256 --> 36:33.324
but I really don't think that

36:33.358 --> 36:36.360
adding more hearing kids to the school

36:36.394 --> 36:38.395
is gonna be so horrible.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.162
Really.

36:41.331 --> 36:44.199
They're not expanding the hearing program.

36:44.233 --> 36:47.334
- They're not?
- No.

36:50.270 --> 36:52.237
They're closing Carlton.

36:52.271 --> 36:55.073
What do you mean they're closing it?

36:55.107 --> 36:58.075
The school board voted

36:58.109 --> 37:02.113
to sell the property and
shut down Carlton for good.

37:02.147 --> 37:04.382
They're going to separate us

37:04.416 --> 37:09.054
- and send us to different schools next year.
- Oh no.

37:09.088 --> 37:11.256
I'm so sorry, honey.

37:12.458 --> 37:15.026
I'm sorry.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.300
Go away.

37:30.074 --> 37:32.475
- Bay?
- I said go away.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.379
You told me to stay out of your life.

37:37.413 --> 37:39.481
Why don't you try staying out of mine?

37:41.150 --> 37:44.185
Bay, I am so sorry.

37:44.219 --> 37:46.454
And I am so touched

37:46.488 --> 37:48.456
that you wanted to help me.

37:51.393 --> 37:54.295
Well, you should have a sit
down with an-hour-ago-Regina,

37:54.330 --> 37:56.264
because she seemed pretty pissed.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.034
I was busy seeing myself as a victim,

38:00.069 --> 38:01.402
so I would have an excuse...

38:01.437 --> 38:03.237
to keep drinking.

38:03.272 --> 38:06.240
So you are drinking again?

38:06.275 --> 38:08.376
Yes.

38:08.410 --> 38:11.079
And it's embarrassing and humiliating

38:11.113 --> 38:13.081
- and I took it all out on you.
- Why?

38:13.115 --> 38:14.416
I'm on your side.

38:16.352 --> 38:18.320
Ever since we moved in,

38:18.354 --> 38:21.089
I have had to depend on other people.

38:21.124 --> 38:23.025
Your mom got me the job at Geraldo's,

38:23.059 --> 38:24.459
Angelo was going to finance the salon

38:24.494 --> 38:27.062
and now when I talk to Daphne

38:27.096 --> 38:29.397
I feel like I need an interpreter.

38:29.432 --> 38:32.200
And drinking makes that
all a little easier.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.439
At least for a little while.

38:37.473 --> 38:39.374
And then you sober up,

38:39.409 --> 38:42.044
and you hate yourself for doing it,

38:42.078 --> 38:44.280
so you want to feel okay again.

38:44.314 --> 38:47.083
- So...
- You drink again.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.252
Pretty much.

38:52.190 --> 38:54.124
So what happens now?

38:56.060 --> 38:58.462
I get myself to the
next meeting I can find.

38:58.496 --> 39:01.465
And I call my sponsor and I
start working the program again,

39:01.500 --> 39:04.201
one day at a time.

39:04.235 --> 39:08.071
Well, is there anything
I can do to help you?

39:10.507 --> 39:12.275
Try to forgive me?

39:15.245 --> 39:17.113
I can do that.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.284
Thank you.

39:27.491 --> 39:29.425
Is, uh... 

39:29.460 --> 39:33.063
there any way that we
could keep this between us?

39:33.097 --> 39:37.034
I don't want to worry Daphne, and
if John and Kathryn found out...

39:37.068 --> 39:38.168
I won't say anything.

39:38.202 --> 39:40.170
Thank you.

39:42.273 --> 39:44.374
This is done, Bay.

39:44.409 --> 39:46.143
You have my word.

40:06.098 --> 40:08.366
I was beginning to think
you weren't gonna come.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.535
I almost didn't.

40:12.471 --> 40:15.306
I'm not sure that this is a good idea.

40:16.375 --> 40:18.342
I am.

40:20.379 --> 40:23.114
I meant what I said on Valentine's Day.

40:23.149 --> 40:26.185
We're just too different.

40:26.219 --> 40:29.121
That's why I didn't text you back.

40:31.224 --> 40:34.193
I meant what I said on
Valentine's day, too.

40:36.263 --> 40:40.366
I've never told anybody
"I love you" before.

40:43.170 --> 40:46.139
You make me want to be a better person,

40:46.173 --> 40:49.344
- someone that you deserve to be with.
- Toby...

40:49.378 --> 40:52.347
And you were the one who said

40:52.382 --> 40:55.317
that having faith isn't easy.

40:55.351 --> 40:57.486
It's believing in something

40:57.520 --> 41:01.056
even when reason tells you not to, right?

41:04.127 --> 41:05.327
Right.

41:05.361 --> 41:09.098
Well, I have faith in us.

41:11.134 --> 41:14.269
And, I think you should too.

41:30.558 --> 41:32.359
I've really missed you.

41:36.431 --> 41:38.398
Louise, hi, it's Regina.

41:38.433 --> 41:41.567
I found a meeting at 9:00 tomorrow,
but if you could call me back tonight,

41:41.602 --> 41:45.105
I'd really appreciate it. I'd
really like someone to talk to.

41:46.540 --> 41:50.310

You have chosen to delete your message.

42:04.558 --> 42:06.426
