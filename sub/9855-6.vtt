00:00.992 --> 00:03.492
Previously on <i>Crossing Lines</i>

00:06.659 --> 00:08.350
No!

00:09.134 --> 00:11.169
We have
a similar Florence case.

00:11.203 --> 00:12.470
Rich victim,

00:12.505 --> 00:15.240
double-tap kills
with 7.62s...

00:15.274 --> 00:16.541
Sure looks like
the same team did both.

00:16.575 --> 00:18.176
<i>This is the message...</i>

00:18.210 --> 00:21.179
<i>"10 million Euros in cash,</i>
<i>by 6:00 tonight."</i>

00:21.213 --> 00:22.547
I thought it was five million?

00:22.581 --> 00:23.948
The price has doubled.

00:23.983 --> 00:26.465
<i>- Why?</i>
- Because I am in charge.

00:26.585 --> 00:28.286
<i>Mama?</i>

00:28.320 --> 00:29.687
Oh, God!

00:29.722 --> 00:31.990
<i>Please pay.</i>
<i>These people have killed.</i>

00:32.024 --> 00:33.424
<i>They will hurt me.</i>

00:33.459 --> 00:35.159
The ransom is 10 million Euros,

00:35.194 --> 00:37.061
<i>by 6:00 P.M. tonight.</i>

00:37.096 --> 00:39.097
It's only 10 hours!
I need more time.

00:39.131 --> 00:41.065
You don't have any more time.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.389 --> 01:05.022
Bring it here.

01:05.057 --> 01:06.558
Move that car back, please.

01:06.592 --> 01:09.127
First, disconnect everything
from the power.

01:09.161 --> 01:10.328
A surge could fry the CPUs.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.297
How could they have
set a bomb here?

01:12.331 --> 01:13.665
Well, clearly,

01:13.699 --> 01:15.567
they've been planning this
for quite some time.

01:15.601 --> 01:17.535
What about the family computer?

01:17.570 --> 01:19.204
Hard drive.

01:19.238 --> 01:21.139
I have everything,
if I need to access it again.

01:21.173 --> 01:22.207
It was a small bomb
in the security hub.

01:22.241 --> 01:24.509
Pretty much
the only room damaged.

01:24.543 --> 01:25.677
Clever, though.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.145
Just took out the main power.

01:27.179 --> 01:28.146
Where's Louis?

01:28.180 --> 01:29.480
He's upstairs,

01:29.515 --> 01:31.349
gathering stuff
before we evacuate.

01:44.763 --> 01:48.533
Maybe housekeeping
has the day off.

01:52.771 --> 01:53.738
This laptop may help.

01:53.772 --> 01:55.273
Mm-hmm.

01:59.044 --> 02:00.578
I think we should get outside.

02:03.816 --> 02:06.017
What the hell kind of
security did you hire?

02:06.051 --> 02:07.285
Excuse me?

02:07.319 --> 02:09.120
First, they let
Maxim get kidnapped,

02:09.154 --> 02:11.089
then somebody plants
a bomb in their office.

02:11.123 --> 02:12.757
So this is all their fault?

02:12.792 --> 02:14.492
Fault?

02:14.527 --> 02:16.628
I don't think they are
smart enough for blame.

02:19.265 --> 02:20.165
You okay?

02:20.199 --> 02:21.533
How was I ever married to that?

02:21.567 --> 02:23.701
There was an explosion?

02:23.736 --> 02:26.571
A small, controlled
blast in the security hub.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.540
A guard was injured.

02:28.574 --> 02:30.680
And...
the kidnappers?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.443
They called, but...

02:32.478 --> 02:33.812
We're waiting
for a new contact,

02:33.846 --> 02:36.681
and it appears that
they caused the explosion.

02:36.715 --> 02:38.116
Marianski's right
about one thing.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.651
That bomb means the kidnappers

02:39.685 --> 02:41.352
were inside your house.

02:43.656 --> 02:44.622
They're all out of the house.

02:44.657 --> 02:46.357
<i>Good.</i>

02:46.392 --> 02:48.092
I've never seen those police
before, though.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.360
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

02:49.395 --> 02:51.095
Haven't we always been told

02:51.130 --> 02:53.398
<i>to abandon</i>
<i>if anything unknown happens?</i>

02:53.432 --> 02:55.500
Just make
the second phone call.

02:55.534 --> 02:57.268
<i>- But...</i>
<i>- Now!</i>

03:06.846 --> 03:09.547
I have a call.

03:09.582 --> 03:10.782
The number says blocked.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.550
Don't let it ring too long.

03:14.787 --> 03:15.753
Yes?

03:15.788 --> 03:17.455
What?

03:18.491 --> 03:20.825
She wants it on speaker.

03:22.304 --> 03:24.529
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

03:25.180 --> 03:25.986
<i>Hello?</i>

03:26.106 --> 03:27.159
Okay.

03:27.279 --> 03:30.135
Do we have
all your attention now?

03:30.169 --> 03:31.703
You already had our attention.

03:31.737 --> 03:33.404
The bomb was unnecessary.

03:33.439 --> 03:34.639
<i>What we heard</i>

03:34.673 --> 03:38.510
<i>was Mr. Marianski</i>
<i>refusing to meet the demand.</i>

03:38.544 --> 03:40.812
<i>We answered his refusal.</i>

03:40.846 --> 03:43.448
<i>You now have until 2:00 P.M.</i>

03:43.482 --> 03:46.451
<i>We will contact you</i>
<i>in two hours exactly,</i>

03:46.485 --> 03:47.852
<i>via Skype...</i>

03:47.887 --> 03:50.555
<i>Or you will never</i>
<i>see Maxim again.</i>

03:52.758 --> 03:55.560
Will you be able to get
a computer running in two hours?

03:55.594 --> 03:58.429
I can set one up
in 45 seconds, madame.

03:58.464 --> 03:59.631
Time's not a factor.

03:59.665 --> 04:02.200
When you're set up,
go though this. It's Maxim's.

04:02.234 --> 04:04.873
Captain Geroux? May we
use your station in town?

04:04.993 --> 04:05.770
Of course.

04:05.805 --> 04:08.940
We should go, right now.

04:16.182 --> 04:17.148
Why?

04:17.183 --> 04:18.649
That phone call,

04:18.684 --> 04:20.185
she waited until
I was in the group,

04:20.219 --> 04:21.886
until I could hear,
even said "okay"

04:21.921 --> 04:22.887
just as I got here,

04:22.922 --> 04:23.888
and then she asked

04:23.923 --> 04:25.557
if she had
all of our attention.

04:25.591 --> 04:26.558
Meaning?

04:26.592 --> 04:28.526
Meaning that I think
she's watching us.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.106
It is Katya. In Florence.

04:33.226 --> 04:37.235
I think you need
to let our superiors know.

04:37.237 --> 04:38.336
I brought a deal to Yan,

04:38.370 --> 04:41.172
and he said he got authorization
to carry it out,

04:41.207 --> 04:42.373
But now,

04:42.408 --> 04:45.410
I'm not sure
he actually told anyone.

05:21.857 --> 05:24.357
We've prepared
a place for you to work.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.312
Mr. Marianski.

05:28.994 --> 05:29.961
Now would be a good time

05:29.995 --> 05:31.329
to start gathering the money.

05:31.563 --> 05:33.231
I'm already working on it.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.503
One hour until contact.

05:38.537 --> 05:39.504
We'll be ready.

05:43.275 --> 05:45.109
Did we have to kill the girl?

05:45.144 --> 05:46.677
You have regrets?

05:46.712 --> 05:48.973
She wasn't a threat.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.882
You know we had to kill her.

05:52.002 --> 05:53.584
And you know why.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.654
Now is the wrong time
to get weak, Masha.

05:56.688 --> 06:00.024
We are close to done. Huh?

06:02.127 --> 06:04.095
Do I need to worry about you?

06:27.820 --> 06:31.289
Because I need it liquidated,
Francois.

06:31.323 --> 06:33.291
Stop questioning me.

06:33.325 --> 06:36.594
No, don't call me back. Do it!

06:38.497 --> 06:40.698
French bankers.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.568
They act like
they own my money.

06:43.602 --> 06:44.803
Will you be able to get it?

06:44.837 --> 06:47.539
It won't be easy.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.740
Madame Pelletier?

06:48.774 --> 06:49.808
Is there any news?

06:49.842 --> 06:51.309
No. Not yet.

06:51.343 --> 06:54.809
I need you to list all workmen

06:54.929 --> 06:57.782
who have been in your home
in the last few months.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.050
Workmen?

06:59.084 --> 07:00.018
Yeah. Construction workers,

07:00.052 --> 07:02.554
utility workers,
anyone with tools.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.689
Someone planted that explosive,

07:04.723 --> 07:06.631
and evidence techs
just uncovered this.

07:06.751 --> 07:09.475
Your camera system
was definitely compromised.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.762
For how long?

07:10.796 --> 07:12.430
There's no way of knowing.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.466
Cameras inside, too?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.967
It appears so.

07:16.001 --> 07:16.968
Why?

07:17.002 --> 07:18.937
Are you worried, Mr. Marianski?

07:18.971 --> 07:22.373
Were you doing something inside
you shouldn't have been?

07:23.576 --> 07:25.710
I don't even live there.

07:25.744 --> 07:27.512
Doesn't mean
you have nothing to hide.

07:27.546 --> 07:28.546
What did you say?

07:28.931 --> 07:30.813
Things like this
are generally done

07:30.933 --> 07:32.200
by people dressed as workmen.

07:32.234 --> 07:33.901
That list will be very helpful.
Thank you.

07:33.936 --> 07:34.902
Louis?

07:38.307 --> 07:39.273
Yeah.

07:41.810 --> 07:44.345
Louis, what's going on?

07:44.379 --> 07:45.713
What do you mean?

07:45.747 --> 07:47.315
What was that about?

07:48.046 --> 07:50.184
Look after yourself, Carl.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.686
Major Daniel?

07:51.720 --> 07:53.054
Yeah?

07:53.088 --> 07:54.288
Laptop's not Maxim's.

07:54.323 --> 07:55.957
It belongs to the girlfriend,
Laure,

07:55.991 --> 07:57.825
which might actually be
more helpful,

07:57.860 --> 08:00.795
because if she was involved,
there might be evidence on it.

08:00.829 --> 08:03.731
Ah. Let me know.

08:21.740 --> 08:24.021
Detective Vicente.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.721
Look who's home.

08:26.755 --> 08:29.023
Florence was never my home.

08:29.057 --> 08:30.324
Well, Italy was,

08:30.359 --> 08:33.394
until you accepted a detail
to the Netherlands.

08:35.397 --> 08:36.364
You sound jealous.

08:36.398 --> 08:39.433
Why? Are the men
handsome there?

08:41.770 --> 08:43.270
How did you know I'd be here?

08:43.304 --> 08:46.174
Your friend at the I.C.C.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.376
Was snooping through
our computers... again.

08:48.410 --> 08:50.244
He doesn't snoop.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.914
He just gets information
we need to do our job.

08:52.948 --> 08:54.849
I am notified when
he does that now.

08:54.883 --> 08:57.130
Thank you for that.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.053
I never should've told you.

08:59.087 --> 09:01.823
Why are you so interested
in such an old case?

09:01.857 --> 09:03.824
Because we have
a similar one in Cannes.

09:03.859 --> 09:06.060
Our case is closed.

09:06.094 --> 09:06.994
It's a total resolution.

09:07.029 --> 09:08.196
No, it's not!

09:08.230 --> 09:09.715
I have a hundred questions.

09:09.965 --> 09:11.132
Where was he held?

09:11.166 --> 09:12.567
How was the turn-over
handled?

09:12.601 --> 09:14.653
Was ransom paid?
How much?

09:14.773 --> 09:16.058
And how were
the demands delivered?

09:16.178 --> 09:17.772
Make an official request.

09:17.806 --> 09:19.073
Listen.

09:19.108 --> 09:22.026
I'll do this for you.
You go back to your team.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.244
I'll get the information

09:23.279 --> 09:24.946
to you through
the proper channels.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.848
I have a victim being
held by kidnappers now,

09:26.882 --> 09:30.218
so I don't really have time
for "proper channels," okay?

09:30.252 --> 09:32.787
Where are you going now?

09:32.821 --> 09:34.589
The only witness
worked at the school,

09:34.623 --> 09:36.157
so I'm gonna start with her.

09:36.192 --> 09:37.725
And then you gonna
have dinner with me?

09:37.760 --> 09:39.827
You never change!

09:39.862 --> 09:40.928
I got a special place

09:40.963 --> 09:43.264
that's gonna blow your mind!

09:50.105 --> 09:52.173
Senora?

09:56.111 --> 09:58.880
Katya. Please.

10:02.117 --> 10:04.919
So, what do you remember

10:05.364 --> 10:07.662
about the Allesandro Cosanza
kidnapping?

10:09.024 --> 10:09.857
Allesandro?

10:09.892 --> 10:10.892
Mm-hmm.

10:10.926 --> 10:15.039
Ohuh... I thought
that case was closed?

10:16.865 --> 10:18.132
I'm not from the same unit

10:18.167 --> 10:20.802
as the first investigators.

10:20.836 --> 10:23.738
And you're listed
as the only witness.

10:23.772 --> 10:26.174
Why was there no one else?

10:28.377 --> 10:32.213
Uh, what unit do you work for?

10:32.248 --> 10:33.748
Please answer my question.

10:36.051 --> 10:38.419
The school was closed.

10:38.454 --> 10:40.985
I was here early that morning,
for a meeting.

10:41.105 --> 10:42.123
With whom?

10:44.259 --> 10:45.893
With Allesandro, actually.

10:45.928 --> 10:48.129
But, um, unfortunately,

10:48.163 --> 10:50.999
he never made it
into the building.

10:51.033 --> 10:54.669
But why were you
meeting with him?

10:54.703 --> 10:56.704
I wanted to show him
some options

10:56.739 --> 10:58.872
for moving on after graduation.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.376
But he was only
in his second year.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.676
So you needed
to schedule a meeting

11:05.796 --> 11:06.915
during off-hours

11:06.949 --> 11:08.783
to discuss something
that wouldn't happen

11:08.817 --> 11:11.085
for the next two years,
is that correct?

11:13.656 --> 11:17.125
You know, um...

11:17.159 --> 11:19.635
It was a very traumatic event
in my life

11:19.755 --> 11:21.496
that I'd rather forget.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.967
Lieutenant Vicente handled it.

11:26.001 --> 11:27.902
You should contact him.

11:29.938 --> 11:32.106
I'm only trying
to understand what happened,

11:32.141 --> 11:34.309
to apply it
to a current kidnapping

11:34.343 --> 11:36.044
we have going on.

11:36.078 --> 11:37.478
- Another kidnapping?
- Yeah.

11:37.513 --> 11:40.281
God, that's horrible.

11:42.084 --> 11:43.952
But, as you see, I'm very busy,

11:43.986 --> 11:48.156
and I really don't know more
than what is in that report.

11:48.190 --> 11:50.225
The officers
were very thorough.

11:52.761 --> 11:53.862
Okay, then.

11:54.808 --> 11:57.304
Well, thanks for your help...

11:58.133 --> 11:59.267
"Katya"?

11:59.301 --> 12:01.269
Yes.

12:06.408 --> 12:08.243
Mr. Marianski.

12:11.351 --> 12:12.785
Is it bad news?

12:12.905 --> 12:15.050
Do you know more
than you've said?

12:15.170 --> 12:16.327
What?

12:21.523 --> 12:23.324
Could this be
because of a business dealing

12:23.359 --> 12:26.027
with your old colleagues?

12:26.061 --> 12:27.570
I've been
a legitimate businessman

12:27.604 --> 12:28.838
for more than a decade.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.141
But you weren't before.
Far from it.

12:32.261 --> 12:35.845
Look, you can ask me anything,
investigate anything.

12:35.879 --> 12:38.815
Names, dates...
I don't care.

12:38.849 --> 12:43.286
Maxim is the only good thing
I ever did.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.254
I would die for him.

12:47.381 --> 12:48.786
Excuse me.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.130
Hey.

12:54.999 --> 12:57.200
Guard's gonna make it.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.369
Marianski called them stupid
for letting it happen.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.204
I don't know about stupid,

13:01.238 --> 13:02.271
but a bomb planted

13:02.306 --> 13:03.439
in the security hub does scream

13:03.474 --> 13:05.141
operational flaw.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.849
You know what else it screams?

13:06.969 --> 13:08.912
Inside job...

13:08.946 --> 13:11.414
And we're running out of
people on the inside.

13:27.898 --> 13:29.632
I have a delivery
for Mr. Marianski.

13:40.978 --> 13:42.211
10 million.

13:42.246 --> 13:43.513
Thank you.

13:43.547 --> 13:44.347
You got it all?

13:44.381 --> 13:46.949
Of course I did.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.191
You are late!

14:28.225 --> 14:30.026
<i>I still have two more minutes.</i>

14:30.060 --> 14:32.495
<i>You were supposed to</i>
<i>sign in at 10:55!</i>

14:32.529 --> 14:34.263
Know where I was?

14:34.298 --> 14:36.032
Talking to a cop
about the last kidnapping.

14:36.066 --> 14:38.268
She was connecting dots
to this one.

14:38.302 --> 14:39.502
Did you tell her anything?

14:39.536 --> 14:40.776
Of course not!

14:40.896 --> 14:42.438
<i>Then forget about her.</i>

14:42.473 --> 14:44.173
<i>This will be over</i>
<i>in a few hours</i>

14:44.208 --> 14:46.476
<i>and we'll all be rich.</i>

14:46.510 --> 14:48.311
<i>Patch me through.</i>

15:02.226 --> 15:03.960
<i>Pay attention.</i>

15:03.994 --> 15:05.395
I want to see my son!

15:05.429 --> 15:08.975
<i>Pay attention</i>
<i>and watch carefully.</i>

15:09.095 --> 15:11.501
<i>Maxim's life will depend on it.</i>

15:13.392 --> 15:15.405
<i>I want to show you something.</i>

15:17.241 --> 15:18.074
<i>These...</i>

15:18.108 --> 15:20.209
<i>Are two standard air tanks.</i>

15:20.244 --> 15:24.681
Each one has got
187 minutes of air.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.011
<i>Remember that number.</i>

15:27.131 --> 15:30.386
<i>It will be very important</i>
<i>to your son's future...</i>

15:30.421 --> 15:32.630
<i>Or lack of.</i>

15:33.724 --> 15:36.259
This tube...

15:36.293 --> 15:40.330
Connects one of the tanks
to a thing we call...

15:40.364 --> 15:41.546
"The box."

15:41.666 --> 15:44.167
You can't breathe inside

15:44.201 --> 15:47.704
<i>unless one of the air tanks</i>
<i>is providing the air.</i>

15:47.738 --> 15:50.573
Here is a little camera...

15:50.608 --> 15:52.196
And here is how it works.

15:52.316 --> 15:56.112
<i>Maxim goes into the box.</i>
<i>We switch one of the tanks on.</i>

15:56.146 --> 16:00.250
<i>That gives him</i>
<i>187 minutes of air.</i>

16:00.284 --> 16:05.255
<i>The ransom drop will be</i>
<i>in 180 minutes...</i>

16:05.289 --> 16:09.192
Exactly 2:00 P.M.

16:09.226 --> 16:10.460
At the Cannes Marina.

16:10.494 --> 16:15.732
Giv <i>that our courier</i>
<i>seven minutes to get away,</i>

16:15.766 --> 16:18.234
<i>make the phone call</i>
<i>to say he's okay.</i>

16:18.269 --> 16:19.102
<i>Then...</i>

16:19.136 --> 16:21.738
We'll switch over the air tanks

16:21.772 --> 16:24.307
<i>and tell you</i>
<i>where to come and get him.</i>

16:24.341 --> 16:26.810
<i>Oh...</i>

16:26.844 --> 16:29.445
<i>And it doesn't matter</i>
<i>who does the drop-off...</i>

16:29.480 --> 16:32.515
<i>The cops, the lawyers...</i>
<i>You can send an army,</i>

16:32.549 --> 16:35.251
because if that phone call
is not made

16:35.286 --> 16:38.288
in that seven minutes
after the drop...

16:38.322 --> 16:39.822
<i>Well, I think you'll get it.</i>

16:44.161 --> 16:45.361
<i>Showtime.</i>

16:45.396 --> 16:46.729
No! No!
Please don't hurt me!

16:46.764 --> 16:47.730
Down!

16:47.765 --> 16:49.832
No! Don't hurt him!

17:06.147 --> 17:07.020
There.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.251
Help me!

17:08.285 --> 17:09.719
187 minutes

17:09.752 --> 17:13.723
until switch-over...

17:13.757 --> 17:16.626
Or suffocation.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.627
Your choice.

17:18.796 --> 17:20.128
<i>One more thing.</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:21.130
Help me!

17:21.165 --> 17:22.397
<i>Remember the little camera?</i>

17:22.433 --> 17:23.800
<i>Help!</i>

17:23.834 --> 17:27.670
<i>Just in case</i>
<i>things do go bad...</i>

17:27.704 --> 17:33.209
You can be with him
all the way until the end.

17:33.243 --> 17:33.943
<i>Help me!</i>

17:33.978 --> 17:35.578
Oh, no! Don't hurt him!

17:39.883 --> 17:41.618
Help me!

17:47.049 --> 17:48.983
<i>It's me again... Katya.</i>

17:49.017 --> 17:50.051
You wanted to know

17:50.085 --> 17:52.145
when they made contact
with the parents?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.205
They just set up a drop.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.774
They put the guy in the box.

17:56.809 --> 18:01.179
You didn't know, did you?

18:02.281 --> 18:05.150
Now, police came here today...
a woman.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.685
Asking questions
about the last one.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.687
I said nothing.

18:09.722 --> 18:10.622
You have to believe

18:10.656 --> 18:13.391
I didn't know
this was freelance.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.161
Yan told me it was all approved!

18:16.195 --> 18:17.195
I didn't know!

18:18.430 --> 18:21.499
Hello? Hello!

19:18.457 --> 19:21.159
Oh, my God.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.823
We have a feed.
Something's coming through.

19:30.943 --> 19:31.984
Mr. Marianski.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.471
<i>Hello?</i>

19:33.506 --> 19:34.706
Eva? Where are you?

19:34.740 --> 19:35.940
How did you get on this Skype?

19:37.376 --> 19:40.178
I'm in the flat
of a woman named Katya.

19:40.212 --> 19:43.248
<i>She was the only witness</i>
<i>in the Florence kidnapping,</i>

19:43.282 --> 19:45.683
and she worked at the art school
<i>the victim attended.</i>

19:45.718 --> 19:46.784
Art school?

19:46.819 --> 19:47.819
You know it?

19:47.853 --> 19:48.787
Didn't Maxim go to

19:48.821 --> 19:49.954
an art school
in Italy for a while?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.389
Yes, the Centro di...

19:51.424 --> 19:53.424
Centro di Restauro.
I just left there.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.425
It's a block from here.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.261
The connection between
the victims.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.329
Katya. She's
a guidance counsellor.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.932
She handled Maxim's enrollment.

20:00.966 --> 20:04.846
Asked me a hundred questions
about him, and about you.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.839
There are three screens here.

20:07.873 --> 20:12.443
One of them has Maxim
in some kind of a small box,

20:12.478 --> 20:15.647
and another one is showing
a fireplace and a brick wall...

20:15.681 --> 20:17.065
<i>An empty room?</i>

20:17.185 --> 20:18.983
Before we switched over
to the box cam,

20:19.018 --> 20:19.984
there was a man on camera.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.586
They left the connection open?

20:21.620 --> 20:22.821
With Katya.

20:22.855 --> 20:23.755
That image is coming from
where they're holding him.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.858
Can we use this to find them?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.593
Maybe... Eva?

20:28.627 --> 20:30.428
I'm going to tell you
how to locate

20:30.463 --> 20:31.763
the I.P. address
of those laptops.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.498
If they're acting
as the communications server

20:33.532 --> 20:34.431
for the operation,

20:34.551 --> 20:36.146
then all the other computers
should be routed through them.

20:36.266 --> 20:37.469
Then we have a chance.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.970
<i>Right. I'm ready. Okay.</i>

20:39.004 --> 20:40.976
The other laptop
with Maxim's feed,

20:41.096 --> 20:42.238
is it a Mac or a pc?

20:42.358 --> 20:43.842
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- The symbol on the laptop.</i>

20:43.876 --> 20:45.428
Is it a Mac or a pc?

20:45.548 --> 20:47.011
<i>What symbol?</i>

20:47.813 --> 20:49.280
Eva! Turn around!

20:49.315 --> 20:50.615
No!

20:50.649 --> 20:51.749
Get up.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.406
Get the gun!
Get the gun!

21:34.994 --> 21:36.995
She's gone.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.831
Eva...

21:45.871 --> 21:47.639
Where's Maxim?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.676
Where's the box?

21:51.710 --> 21:52.911
It doesn't matter.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.313
What do you mean,
it doesn't matter?

21:55.347 --> 21:58.616
I knew it wasn't authorized.

21:59.268 --> 22:03.054
I knew and they'll know.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.425
We're all dead anyway.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.727
It...

22:09.762 --> 22:10.662
Doesn't matter!

22:25.558 --> 22:26.892
 Hello?

22:27.012 --> 22:27.832
Eva!

22:28.941 --> 22:29.868
Are you all right?

22:29.988 --> 22:32.957
<i>Yeah, I'm... I'm all right.</i>

22:32.991 --> 22:33.891
But the lady, Katya...

22:35.027 --> 22:36.627
She's not...

22:38.864 --> 22:40.064
She's dead.

22:40.098 --> 22:41.999
I still might be able to use

22:42.034 --> 22:44.635
the laptops to locate them.
I will call you.

22:44.670 --> 22:47.004
Major. You need
to get going.

22:47.039 --> 22:48.473
- Why? What...
- The ransom.

22:48.507 --> 22:49.874
Yeah.

22:56.348 --> 22:57.949
Laure...

22:57.983 --> 23:01.452
You said you'd take me
dancing before the party.

23:01.487 --> 23:03.588
Don't forget the party after.

23:03.622 --> 23:05.923
Why...

23:05.958 --> 23:07.992
<i>You deserve tonight, baby.</i>

23:08.026 --> 23:10.528
Why did you do this?

23:12.131 --> 23:14.499
He thinks
his girlfriend did this.

23:14.533 --> 23:16.534
So what?

23:18.103 --> 23:20.338
His heart breaks
like everyone else's.

23:20.372 --> 23:22.406
Did you really just say that?

23:22.441 --> 23:23.541
Shut up.

23:27.062 --> 23:28.679
Where did that come from?

23:28.714 --> 23:29.714
Sometimes, I hate you.

23:30.721 --> 23:34.352
"His heart breaks
like everyone else's!"

23:45.337 --> 23:47.031
Be careful out there, major.

23:47.066 --> 23:48.065
Okay.

23:50.169 --> 23:52.036
I wish I could show you

23:52.071 --> 23:54.505
how much I appreciate
what you are all doing.

23:54.540 --> 23:58.409
A bonus at Christmas time
wouldn't be turned down.

23:59.109 --> 24:00.844
I'll remember that.

24:06.084 --> 24:07.885
What? I'm not a cop anymore.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.887
Uh, no.
No, no. I just, um...

24:09.922 --> 24:11.455
I need to show you something.

24:22.434 --> 24:23.534
Dorn.

24:23.569 --> 24:25.284
Louis.

24:25.404 --> 24:27.234
I don't know, Dorn.

24:27.912 --> 24:29.284
You don't know?

24:29.708 --> 24:31.909
I can't tell
if it's connected or not.

24:31.944 --> 24:33.010
He says it's not.

24:33.045 --> 24:35.137
You asked him?

24:35.431 --> 24:36.464
Not directly.

24:36.498 --> 24:39.867
Listen, I am in the middle
of something now.

24:39.902 --> 24:41.436
I don't think
you should go to Russia

24:41.470 --> 24:42.770
until we can be certain

24:42.805 --> 24:44.833
<i>Dimitrov doesn't know.</i>

24:44.953 --> 24:47.675
Right. Good idea.

24:47.710 --> 24:48.810
Thank you, Louis.

25:19.375 --> 25:22.377
I think you're right.

25:22.411 --> 25:24.679
What should we do about it?

25:27.049 --> 25:29.851
Nothin'...

25:29.886 --> 25:31.486
Yet.

25:38.394 --> 25:39.594
<i>Is someone watching this?</i>

25:39.628 --> 25:41.629
<i>Anyone?</i>

25:42.865 --> 25:45.733
<i>Someone?</i>

25:45.768 --> 25:49.571
It's not like you could answer,
right?

25:49.605 --> 25:53.608
<i>But I need to say something</i>
<i>to my parents.</i>

25:54.877 --> 25:57.979
You were right
about Laure, mom.

25:58.013 --> 26:01.549
<i>It's all because of her.</i>

26:05.387 --> 26:09.023
I was stupid to believe
anyone could like me for me.

26:10.120 --> 26:15.597
But I've been thinking about me
<i>and you and dad.</i>

26:16.832 --> 26:19.567
Why were we always so angry?

26:23.305 --> 26:25.340
You mad at dad...

26:26.976 --> 26:29.609
Dad mad at me,
me mad at everybody.

26:31.147 --> 26:34.634
<i>The whole house was angry</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

26:34.754 --> 26:37.685
<i>I hated it.</i>

26:38.287 --> 26:43.057
And, right now, honestly...

26:43.092 --> 26:46.361
I can't remember
why it was like that.

26:46.395 --> 26:50.298
<i>It's no use to be mad.</i>

26:50.332 --> 26:54.769
<i>All I want to do is go home</i>
<i>and be together.</i>

26:54.803 --> 26:57.005
Be strong, son.

26:57.039 --> 26:58.006
Help is coming.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.675
<i>Tell my parents I'm sorry...</i>

27:03.012 --> 27:07.582
...And I'm going to miss them.

27:14.790 --> 27:16.057
I have it, the empty room.

27:32.141 --> 27:33.708
Where do I find Maxim?

27:36.912 --> 27:39.229
Tommy, the target
is on the move.

27:39.198 --> 27:41.954
I have it, major. North.

27:42.074 --> 27:43.267
<i>Stay as far back</i>
<i>as you can</i>

27:43.302 --> 27:44.969
<i>until he makes the call.</i>

27:45.003 --> 27:47.071
We need them
to change that tank over.

27:47.105 --> 27:50.208
<i>Captain Geroux and his men</i>
<i>will track it from the ground.</i>

27:50.242 --> 27:51.843
Don't lose that money.

27:51.877 --> 27:53.054
You got it, boss.

27:53.174 --> 27:55.732
<i>Maxim has</i>
<i>only five minutes of air left.</i>

28:04.022 --> 28:05.356
Look! The room!

28:05.390 --> 28:07.191
You don't need to whisper.

28:07.226 --> 28:08.226
It's a one-way connection.

28:08.260 --> 28:10.027
They don't know
we can see them.

28:10.062 --> 28:12.296
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes! Masha!</i>

28:12.331 --> 28:13.898
"Masha"? He named her.

28:13.932 --> 28:15.132
Yeah. Yeah.

28:17.402 --> 28:19.871
He's got
the money.

28:19.905 --> 28:20.772
He's got the money!

28:25.838 --> 28:27.445
Go and change the air tanks.

28:27.479 --> 28:29.080
I'll tell them that
they can pick him up.

28:29.114 --> 28:30.314
Can you isolate those faces?

28:30.349 --> 28:34.051
Running them through
facial recognition software now.

28:49.068 --> 28:50.668
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

28:50.702 --> 28:52.937
I think they've
changed the tanks over.

28:52.971 --> 28:55.807
<i>Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.</i>
<i>Pick up. Pick up. Pick up!</i>

28:55.841 --> 28:57.308
Katya's not going to answer.

28:57.342 --> 28:58.376
Come on!
Tell us where you are!

28:58.410 --> 29:00.144
<i>Pick up!</i>
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

29:00.179 --> 29:01.345
Okay, the male is named...

29:01.380 --> 29:04.148
<i>- Yan!</i>
<i>- Pick up!</i>

29:04.183 --> 29:05.249
What the...

29:10.956 --> 29:12.956
Oh, my God!

29:18.030 --> 29:19.264
No! You have to find him!

29:20.798 --> 29:22.632
- He has only three hours!
- They're following the money!

29:22.667 --> 29:23.900
You have to!

29:23.934 --> 29:25.969
Oh, God! They don't know!
They don't know where he is!

29:26.003 --> 29:27.671
Let them work!

29:27.705 --> 29:31.041
It's okay. It's okay.
Let them work.

29:31.075 --> 29:32.742
We still have
a good track, right?

29:32.777 --> 29:33.777
Still going straight north.

29:33.811 --> 29:34.945
Anne-Marie, calculate
the exact amount

29:34.979 --> 29:36.413
of time we have left!

29:36.447 --> 29:37.414
The exact amount!

29:37.448 --> 29:38.582
<i>- Guys?</i>
<i>- Go, Tommy!</i>

29:38.616 --> 29:39.749
The tracker...

29:39.784 --> 29:41.451
- ...it's stopped moving.
<i>- Call them in, Tommy.</i>

29:41.485 --> 29:42.452
Take him down.

29:52.763 --> 29:53.830
Against the wall!

29:53.864 --> 29:56.566
Where is he?
The guy in the box?

29:56.600 --> 29:58.768
What do you want?

29:58.803 --> 29:59.736
I just delivered!

29:59.770 --> 30:01.504
I was told to
put them in that can!

30:01.539 --> 30:02.606
Who paid you?

30:02.640 --> 30:04.941
I work for the courier company!

30:04.976 --> 30:06.977
Get him out of here!

30:07.930 --> 30:09.612
Yeah, all right.

30:09.647 --> 30:11.681
He didn't know anything.

30:11.716 --> 30:13.750
He's just a delivery man.

30:14.662 --> 30:15.534
Time's running out.

30:15.654 --> 30:16.853
What are we gonna do?

30:19.090 --> 30:20.857
Now's the time.

30:26.697 --> 30:29.499
May I have a moment,
please? Alone?

30:29.533 --> 30:30.567
I don't understand.

30:30.601 --> 30:31.501
What's going on?

30:33.504 --> 30:35.805
It's all right, monsieur.

30:47.214 --> 30:49.653
- Anne-Marie?
- Mm-hmm?

30:49.687 --> 30:52.055
Would you say that's a window?

30:52.089 --> 30:53.023
What?

30:53.057 --> 30:54.339
Look at the glass,
on the table.

30:54.459 --> 30:55.827
Is that a window
reflected in it?

30:55.947 --> 30:57.527
Maybe...

30:57.561 --> 30:58.662
Let me enhance this.

30:58.696 --> 31:00.521
I'll get an image of
the landscape outside.

31:00.641 --> 31:03.138
And we should look through all
the footage we've been sent.

31:03.568 --> 31:06.370
You know, the ransom,

31:06.404 --> 31:08.739
it's almost exactly
what Lev has left.

31:08.773 --> 31:12.342
They couldn't have
known that...

31:12.377 --> 31:14.645
But his financials
were on your computer.

31:14.679 --> 31:16.446
Does he know that?

31:16.481 --> 31:18.348
I mean, you had to figure
we would find that out.

31:18.383 --> 31:21.485
Uh...

31:21.519 --> 31:24.855
That must've been left there
when we... when he moved...

31:24.889 --> 31:28.859
And the cameras, the bomb...
H...

31:28.893 --> 31:30.560
How could they have gotten into

31:30.595 --> 31:33.363
and out of your home
without being seen?

31:33.398 --> 31:36.900
And when I said
that the cameras inside...

31:36.934 --> 31:38.568
were probably compromised,

31:38.603 --> 31:40.604
Caroline,
you didn't even blink.

31:40.638 --> 31:44.207
I'd think the notion
of those kidnappers watching you

31:44.242 --> 31:46.476
walk around your house

31:46.511 --> 31:48.003
would have bothered you
just a little.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.713
I must not have...

31:49.747 --> 31:50.814
Was that to put
pressure on Lev?

31:50.848 --> 31:52.382
You knew the insurance
was cancelled.

31:52.417 --> 31:53.784
You knew he'd balk
at the amount?

31:53.818 --> 31:57.122
Did you need
a final convincer? A bomb?

31:57.242 --> 31:58.388
No. I would never, I...

31:58.423 --> 32:00.590
Caroline,
on Laure's Facebook account,

32:00.625 --> 32:04.761
she sent a message to her sister
about Maxim's surprise party,

32:04.796 --> 32:07.164
about how she was supposed to
take him to the club,

32:07.198 --> 32:08.799
and then to the party,

32:08.833 --> 32:10.334
but nobody was supposed
to know...

32:12.870 --> 32:15.372
And that she was excited
that you...

32:15.406 --> 32:17.908
trusted her enough
to help you surprise him,

32:17.942 --> 32:19.876
that you, Caroline...

32:19.911 --> 32:22.479
Gave her the address
to that non-existent party.

32:33.925 --> 32:36.293
I don't know
where they are holding him.

32:40.798 --> 32:42.733
That was their one condition...

32:42.767 --> 32:44.601
That I wouldn't know
until they had the money.

32:46.504 --> 32:48.438
Tell me everything you know.

32:48.473 --> 32:50.774
Everything.

32:57.382 --> 32:58.882
The other one went so well.

32:58.916 --> 33:02.419
Maxim was a new student
at the art school

33:02.453 --> 33:04.655
when the other boy
was kidnapped.

33:06.424 --> 33:09.259
I overheard it...
the woman, Katya,

33:09.294 --> 33:11.228
was on the phone
with the kidnappers.

33:11.262 --> 33:15.365
She didn't know I was there.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.267
At first, I was going to
turn her in,

33:17.301 --> 33:19.002
but...

33:19.037 --> 33:21.705
I thought,

33:21.739 --> 33:23.423
"let's see how this goes."

33:25.643 --> 33:27.911
"See how
it turns out."

33:27.945 --> 33:30.747
I guess I was already
thinking about Lev,

33:30.782 --> 33:33.984
and hurting him.

33:35.127 --> 33:37.321
I hate him so much.

33:43.895 --> 33:47.664
When the other boy, Allesandro,
was returned safely,

33:47.699 --> 33:50.267
completely unharmed,

33:50.301 --> 33:53.670
I went to see Katya and told her
that I would turn them in,

33:53.705 --> 33:55.819
unless we could work together,

33:55.939 --> 33:58.775
and that my ex-husband
was very rich and...

33:58.810 --> 33:59.676
What about the girl?

33:59.711 --> 34:02.379
Why was she killed?

34:04.382 --> 34:05.816
I don't know.

34:05.850 --> 34:08.385
Do you have any idea
where they're holding him?

34:30.629 --> 34:31.728
Louis?

34:31.763 --> 34:33.230
It was not Dimitrov.

34:34.399 --> 34:35.366
Are you sure?

34:35.400 --> 34:36.067
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:36.101 --> 34:39.070
It was the mother.

34:39.103 --> 34:43.174
She set it up to hurt Marianski
over personal issues.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.376
Thank you, Louis.

35:06.198 --> 35:09.300
We have an image of
the landscape outside the house.

35:09.334 --> 35:11.802
I enhanced the reflection
of a window

35:11.837 --> 35:14.171
in the glass on the table.

35:14.206 --> 35:17.375
I have a geo-profiling program
that I can feed it into,

35:17.409 --> 35:18.709
see what matches that area.

35:18.744 --> 35:19.710
Look!

35:21.780 --> 35:22.947
What?

35:22.981 --> 35:26.301
There. Doesn't that look like
a radio telescope, on the hill?

35:26.421 --> 35:27.818
Oh, it sure does.

35:27.853 --> 35:30.087
We can triangulate
with the landscape

35:30.122 --> 35:32.857
from the window reflected
in the glass.

35:34.827 --> 35:36.727
Come on!

35:38.964 --> 35:39.797
Yes!

35:39.832 --> 35:41.065
Is that live?

35:41.099 --> 35:43.402
No, it's a satellite image.
Tommy.

35:43.522 --> 35:46.382
<i>We believe Maxim could be</i>
<i>in a very isolated area.</i>

35:46.622 --> 35:47.722
<i>You need to find it fast.</i>

35:47.756 --> 35:48.890
Shoot.

35:48.924 --> 35:49.958
<i>I'm going to send you</i>
<i>some nav coordinates</i>

35:49.992 --> 35:51.092
<i>to your PDA.</i>

35:51.126 --> 35:53.628
<i>We think this is where</i>
<i>Maxim is.</i>

35:55.097 --> 35:56.564
<i>It's an isolated farmhouse,</i>

35:56.598 --> 35:59.067
<i>surrounded by whitish</i>
<i>stone outcroppings.</i>

35:59.101 --> 36:00.968
<i>There's a radio com tower</i>

36:01.003 --> 36:03.697
<i>a half kilometer north</i>
<i>of the farmhouse.</i>

36:03.817 --> 36:05.106
All right.

36:05.140 --> 36:07.883
<i>Tommy,</i>
<i>we don't have a lot of time.</i>

36:18.896 --> 36:20.544
<i>It's in a small valley, Tommy.</i>

36:20.664 --> 36:22.710
<i>The farmhouse</i>
<i>should be in the center.</i>

36:22.830 --> 36:23.825
Nothing!

36:23.859 --> 36:25.760
<i>You're looking</i>
<i>for a radio tower</i>

36:25.794 --> 36:26.928
<i>and a farmhouse nearby.</i>

36:26.962 --> 36:28.696
I don't see it!

36:31.000 --> 36:33.534
<i>I'm just seeing fields, mate.</i>

36:33.569 --> 36:36.476
<i>Tommy, the air is running out.</i>

36:44.146 --> 36:45.584
<i>No, wait, wait!</i>

36:45.704 --> 36:47.247
<i>This might be something!</i>

36:48.851 --> 36:51.152
This must be it!

36:51.186 --> 36:53.821
Send me down there now!

37:11.540 --> 37:12.878
All right. I have him.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.465
<i>Yeah, he's breathing.</i>
<i>He's good.</i>

37:18.080 --> 37:20.014
He's got him.

37:31.193 --> 37:32.827
What will happen to her?

37:32.861 --> 37:35.225
Can she afford a good lawyer?

37:36.498 --> 37:37.452
The best.

37:37.572 --> 37:38.533
Good.

37:38.567 --> 37:42.737
What she did is inexcusable...

37:42.771 --> 37:44.172
But I'm not blameless in it.

37:51.847 --> 37:54.974
So I guess the Christmas gift
won't be necessary?

37:55.094 --> 37:58.152
I was just joking about that.

37:58.187 --> 38:01.022
Still... I'm fine with it.

38:02.958 --> 38:04.125
What do you mean?

38:04.159 --> 38:07.528
$30,000 seems more than fair
to get my son back.

38:19.608 --> 38:20.608
I need to...

38:22.378 --> 38:24.946
There's a lot
to explain to him.

38:24.980 --> 38:27.181
Yeah.

38:34.056 --> 38:35.990
Papa...

39:18.901 --> 39:20.969
I'm sorry.

39:24.106 --> 39:26.708
It's all right.

39:32.314 --> 39:34.782
I don't want to forget.

39:34.817 --> 39:36.417
Rebecca...

39:39.855 --> 39:41.422
I know.

39:57.239 --> 39:59.674
I saw the light.

40:00.669 --> 40:02.058
Come in.

40:02.478 --> 40:04.445
Come in, please.

40:09.558 --> 40:10.599
Sit.

40:17.226 --> 40:19.827
You wanted to know
if Genovese had left again?

40:19.862 --> 40:21.896
I did.

40:21.931 --> 40:23.331
A bunch of them left.

40:23.365 --> 40:25.733
Genovese,
the manager, the boss.

40:25.768 --> 40:27.702
They all left in a hurry.

40:27.736 --> 40:28.937
For good?

40:28.971 --> 40:32.006
They said they'd be back
in a few days,

40:32.041 --> 40:35.076
but something seemed
to be bothering them.

40:43.485 --> 40:44.886
Thank you.

40:47.790 --> 40:50.191
You're welcome.

40:50.225 --> 40:52.226
Shari?

40:57.032 --> 40:59.434
Don't go.

41:21.290 --> 41:24.525
Yes. It's SB335.

41:26.395 --> 41:28.329
Yes, I had a very bad night,

41:28.364 --> 41:32.867
but it's okay,
I have the money.

41:32.901 --> 41:34.596
All 30,000 of it.
