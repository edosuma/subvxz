WEBVTT

00:44.628 --> 00:47.089
All right, Radar. Okay, come on. Let's go.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.577
- Going good?
- Yep.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.744
Yeah?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.498
- Think you'll have it by--
- I'll get there.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.107
- She's not gonna make it, is she?
- You should be at your desks.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.651
We've both been done a week.
What is there to do?

05:59.735 --> 06:01.695
- Is she gonna make it?
- She's gonna make it.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.779
Mark.

06:02.863 --> 06:03.864
Yes?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.200
- Don't laugh.
- At?

06:06.909 --> 06:10.245
I just wonder if it might be helpful
for us to stand behind her

06:10.329 --> 06:12.331
and perhaps chant her name.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.712
Okay. She'll make it. Just let her focus.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.015
How's she doing?

06:30.557 --> 06:32.518
Gonna be down to the wire.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.192
She'll make it.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.070
Let's prep for when she makes it.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.618
And I want to schedule

06:49.701 --> 06:52.746
a end-of-the-quarter wellness session
for Mark…

06:54.248 --> 06:55.374
one last time.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.044
Really?

07:04.508 --> 07:05.509
Seth.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.555
I know that this
has been a trying quarter,

07:09.638 --> 07:11.807
and you have availed yourself well.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.854
Mr. Graner sits with Kier now,

07:17.646 --> 07:20.774
and I imagine they're both
very satisfied with you.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.765
Hey.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.685
Did you…

07:57.311 --> 07:58.395
I think I did.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.703
- She do it?
- She did it!

08:17.789 --> 08:19.041
Fuck and yes.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.126
Oh, my goodness.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.815
<i>I knew you could do it, Helly R.</i>

08:45.317 --> 08:48.445
<i>Even in your darkest moments,
I could see you arriving here.</i>

08:50.155 --> 08:54.701
<i>In refining your macrodata file, you have
brought glory to this company and to me.</i>

08:55.494 --> 08:56.828
<i>Kier Eagan.</i>

08:57.329 --> 09:00.582
<i>I-- I love you.</i>

09:01.708 --> 09:05.295
<i>But now I must away, for there are others
who need me around the world.</i>

09:06.213 --> 09:09.550
<i>Goodbye, Helly R., and thank you.</i>

09:26.567 --> 09:29.945
Boom! That's quota. We did it.

09:30.654 --> 09:31.655
Good work.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.327
So it's on now?

09:53.844 --> 09:56.680
Oh, Mark. I don't know how you knew

09:56.763 --> 09:59.725
for the end of the quarter
I wanted a heart attack.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.814
Well, we made it,
despite a staffing shake-up.

10:05.898 --> 10:10.068
Yes, and spending half of your
time farting around the halls.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.779
Still, yes. You made it.

10:12.863 --> 10:16.325
Have you decided who you want
to stay for the waffle party?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.076
I was thinking Dylan.

10:21.580 --> 10:25.083
You know you can choose yourself
or anyone but Dylan.

10:25.918 --> 10:30.923
Yeah, but it's more his thing,
and he really worked hard.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.555
Well, I'll make the arrangements.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.641
- Great.
- But before you celebrate,

10:41.558 --> 10:43.393
I'd like you to drop by wellness.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.478
Really?

10:44.561 --> 10:48.190
Yes. I'm having all department heads
do it end-of-quarter.

10:49.024 --> 10:53.529
With all of this stress and Mr. Graner
retiring and everything.

10:54.905 --> 10:55.906
Of course.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.247
Mark, all sarcasm aside…

11:04.164 --> 11:05.374
Yeah.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.085
Thank you.

11:10.254 --> 11:11.255
I--

11:11.922 --> 11:13.799
Lumon needed this.

11:26.812 --> 11:27.813
Mark.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.065
Ms. Casey.

11:38.574 --> 11:39.741
Where'd the tree go?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.246
You can have a seat.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.460
Why's everything in boxes?

11:53.380 --> 11:56.550
Evidently Lumon's been blessed
with a new wellness director.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.971
So I'll be retiring at the conclusion
of this session, and the room is--

12:01.054 --> 12:02.222
What? Wait.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.558
When did they tell you?

12:07.811 --> 12:10.522
Just now. Just a moment ago.

12:30.792 --> 12:31.835
Mark S.,

12:33.045 --> 12:36.965
you have successfully led your department,
Macrodata Refinement,

12:37.049 --> 12:38.717
to meet their quarterly quota,

12:39.510 --> 12:43.931
and are thus eligible for this special,
augmented wellness session.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.849
I didn't think you'd get fired.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.772
"Your outie is kind.

12:52.940 --> 12:58.195
Your outie has brightened people's days
by merely smiling.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.741
Your outie makes time for people,
even when--"

13:02.824 --> 13:04.493
Hey, let me talk to somebody.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.341
I really liked being in the office
with you all that day.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.846
I know I vexed you.

13:24.513 --> 13:27.140
I know I'm… strange.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.269
No, you're not strange.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.605
My life has been 107 hours long.

13:34.439 --> 13:37.234
Most of that has been
these half-hour sessions.

13:39.319 --> 13:43.407
For me,
my favorite time was the eight hours

13:43.490 --> 13:47.327
I spent in your department watching Helly.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.457
It's the longest I've ever been awake.

13:56.295 --> 13:59.089
I suppose it's what you could call
my good old days.

14:04.303 --> 14:06.054
There must be something we can do.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.275
Why do you care what happens to me?

14:31.371 --> 14:34.750
<i>Because we're people, not parts of people.</i>

14:35.959 --> 14:39.046
<i>Even with what little they gave us,
these are our lives.</i>

14:40.881 --> 14:42.966
<i>No one gets to just turn you off.</i>

14:48.555 --> 14:49.890
You're nice, Mark.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.576
"Your outie is kind.

15:11.161 --> 15:16.041
Your outie can set up a tent
in under three minutes.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.964
Your outie knows a beautiful rock
from a plain one.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.676
<i>Your outie likes giving--"</i>

15:26.969 --> 15:28.679
You know it's good, right?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.807
That they don't remember each other?

15:34.017 --> 15:36.061
It means the chips work.

15:38.647 --> 15:39.773
It's a win.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.362
Take her back down

15:46.905 --> 15:49.449
to the testing floor, please.

16:45.339 --> 16:48.509
Do you know if I'm happy up there?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.136
Of course.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.473
You do all sorts of wonderful things.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.242
- Could I just--
- I'm sorry.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.869
I just have so much to do today.

17:17.663 --> 17:18.997
On you go.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.455
- Mark.
- Where were you?

18:00.539 --> 18:02.416
They gave me a wellness check.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.878
Okay. You're all set for the waffle party.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.504
How's Ms. Casey?

18:07.588 --> 18:09.631
I mean, I'm over her,
but I still wanna be friends.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.428
- They fired her.
- What?

18:14.511 --> 18:15.596
Yeah. She just found out.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.015
Well, can we help her?
Is there anything we can do?

18:18.891 --> 18:20.017
I don't know.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.979
Is everyone sure they wanna do this?

18:25.022 --> 18:27.524
Any Macrodats ready to party?

18:28.942 --> 18:29.943
Yeah.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.866
Dylan G.'s waffle party
will commence at close of day.

18:36.617 --> 18:37.993
In the meantime,

18:38.076 --> 18:41.830
I've ordered the pre-waffle party
egg bar social for everyone.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.792
Yes! Pay dirt! Yeah!

18:45.876 --> 18:48.879
All of you deserve this
for reaching quota.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.173
But before we begin…

18:53.300 --> 18:57.554
A very special gift
for a very special Dylan.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.225
Our three-time R of the Q!

19:01.975 --> 19:04.853
A man whose mind
is as sharp as his incisors.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.438
Right, bud?

19:14.696 --> 19:15.739
Open it.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.493
Yeah, I bet you'd like that, fuckers.
But my prize, my eyes, so…

19:19.576 --> 19:21.328
Maybe you should show them, Dylan.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.539
Show them what you requested.

19:24.957 --> 19:26.250
Yeah, show us, man.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.335
Fine.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.892
Okay, yeah.
Let's switch up the vibe in here.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.358
Good?

20:13.714 --> 20:16.383
Jesus, this is actually good.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.178
Yeah, the egg bar is coveted as fuck.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.313
Look at this thing over here.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.606
Looking good.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.949
I should be the one to stay behind.

20:41.783 --> 20:42.826
Nope.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.538
Don't you wanna see your kid again?

20:47.664 --> 20:50.000
What we're doing tonight
is just the first step.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.339
Are you sure?

21:23.784 --> 21:26.161
Helly R. attempted suicide
three weeks ago.

21:28.497 --> 21:29.665
Yes, she did.

21:32.376 --> 21:33.627
How could you not tell us?

21:36.046 --> 21:37.756
Did Milchick give you those?

21:39.883 --> 21:41.218
Answer the question.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.930
Am I speaking with the Board?

21:47.266 --> 21:49.309
We also know that
you've been spending time

21:49.393 --> 21:51.353
at the home of Mark Scout's sister.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.066
Right.

21:57.067 --> 22:01.822
It has been decided that you be suspended
from your position, effective immediately.

22:03.699 --> 22:04.825
You are fired.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.161
Go--

22:10.831 --> 22:12.875
Oh, fuck off, Natalie!

22:14.459 --> 22:16.044
Is the Board even there?

22:22.217 --> 22:23.510
<i>Yes.</i>

22:33.687 --> 22:35.355
I'm sorry. That was rude.

22:36.815 --> 22:40.569
I can explain everything
to the Board tonight, please.

22:44.323 --> 22:45.949
The Board has concluded the call.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.030
"Endow in each swing of your ax

23:25.113 --> 23:29.243
or swipe of your pen
the sum of your affections,

23:30.118 --> 23:33.205
that through me they may be purified

23:34.289 --> 23:35.624
and returned.

23:39.461 --> 23:42.047
No higher purpose may be found than this.

23:44.716 --> 23:48.554
Nor any… higher love."

24:18.125 --> 24:19.334
I figured it out.

24:20.252 --> 24:22.212
The goats lay the eggs.

24:22.296 --> 24:23.547
Oh, my God. You got it!

24:39.021 --> 24:40.314
You scared about tonight?

24:44.484 --> 24:45.485
Yeah.

24:48.697 --> 24:51.408
I'm scared of getting caught.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.832
They left us unattended,
and thought we'd be too dumb to notice.

24:59.875 --> 25:01.460
They won't see this coming.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.423
Or we won't wake up.

25:17.434 --> 25:19.061
Or we're all assholes out there.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.189
Well, that's a given for me.

25:26.109 --> 25:30.489
You know, I just hope it turns out
I have things I care about.

25:31.532 --> 25:32.658
Like, for real.

25:35.744 --> 25:37.871
You pretended to care
about me pretty well.

25:43.669 --> 25:45.546
You're easy to pretend to care about.

25:53.011 --> 25:54.012
Thank you.

25:56.807 --> 25:57.808
As are you.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.309
Thanks.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.314
Okay, Refiners!

26:05.274 --> 26:07.985
I need to see about a management issue,
and this party is over.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.405
I'll leave the food.

26:11.488 --> 26:12.990
Thank you, Mr. Milchick.

26:13.073 --> 26:16.577
Dylan, I'll be back to escort you
to perpetuity shortly.

26:53.697 --> 26:54.698
Key card.

27:10.297 --> 27:11.465
On you go then.

27:34.488 --> 27:37.324
Okay, look,
you don't mess with any other departments.

27:37.407 --> 27:38.867
- It's just us three.
- I know.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.453
The machine's designed
to be operated by two--

27:41.537 --> 27:42.871
Two people. I'll be fine.

27:42.955 --> 27:44.289
Can I have the stuff, please?

27:51.463 --> 27:54.466
Now, look, it's likely we'll all
wake up around people.

27:54.550 --> 27:57.678
Could be driving or skiing,
whatever we do up there.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.930
So be ready for anything
as you go up the elevator.

28:00.013 --> 28:01.014
Okay?

28:01.598 --> 28:04.852
The important thing is you find someone
it seems you can trust,

28:04.935 --> 28:07.145
and you tell them everything.

28:07.229 --> 28:09.189
And we don't know how long
Dylan will be able to give us,

28:09.273 --> 28:11.483
so we can't get distracted
digging into our lives.

28:11.567 --> 28:13.610
Right. The mission is the priority.

28:20.576 --> 28:22.995
I probably should've told you guys…

28:27.040 --> 28:29.459
But I kept this.

28:31.253 --> 28:33.589
And there was a part of it that--

28:35.424 --> 28:36.633
Well…

28:42.723 --> 28:46.685
"Our job… is to taste free air.

28:48.478 --> 28:53.901
Your so-called boss may own the clock
that taunts you from the wall.

28:53.984 --> 28:56.695
- But, my--"
- "But, my friends, the hour is yours."

29:02.576 --> 29:04.203
Page 197 slaps.

29:20.636 --> 29:21.803
Okay, kids.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.476
Let's find out what's for dinner.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.443
You think we're about to meet our spouses?

29:37.736 --> 29:38.946
Maybe.

29:39.780 --> 29:40.948
Maybe it's each other.

29:42.074 --> 29:43.325
That'd be a hoot.

29:43.408 --> 29:44.493
Yeah.

29:45.827 --> 29:49.790
Yeah, like, mid-argument
over car wash coupons.

29:50.707 --> 29:52.417
"Honey, you're cutting them wrong!"

30:00.092 --> 30:01.218
- Okay.
- All right.

30:26.159 --> 30:27.786
In case we don't come back.

30:29.121 --> 30:30.747
Or, I don't know, in case we do?

30:31.331 --> 30:32.332
Right.

30:39.673 --> 30:41.049
Good luck out there, boss.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.498
"Type. Trackball. Type. Flip.

31:13.582 --> 31:17.377
Trackball. Enter. Shift. Enter."

31:20.672 --> 31:21.757
Okay.

31:22.341 --> 31:24.551
Are you ready, Dylan G.?

31:28.222 --> 31:29.223
Dylan G.?

31:30.516 --> 31:31.850
I'll be out in a minute!

31:31.934 --> 31:33.352
"Select, flip…"

32:35.747 --> 32:36.748
Enjoy.

33:40.729 --> 33:44.066
Fuck her goddamn soul forever into hell!

33:44.149 --> 33:49.196
Filth and fucking fire
until she fucking dies!

33:50.072 --> 33:54.284
Fuck her and her fucking fake smile!

33:55.118 --> 33:56.453
Oh, God.

33:57.579 --> 34:00.249
Fuck her goddamn soul!

36:10.420 --> 36:11.547
No.

36:24.977 --> 36:26.144
Why?

37:32.461 --> 37:33.629
Mark.

37:35.005 --> 37:36.131
Hi, Mrs. Selvig.

37:36.215 --> 37:37.716
Sorry to just pop over…

37:37.799 --> 37:39.593
Yes? What is it?

37:40.802 --> 37:42.971
Well, I'm headed to Devon and Ricken's.

37:43.055 --> 37:45.224
- They have that party tonight.
- And?

37:45.849 --> 37:50.437
Well, Devon asked me to double-check,
see if you're interested in coming.

37:52.147 --> 37:57.694
I am sorry, Mark. I'm just--
I'm not feeling quite myself this evening.

37:58.278 --> 38:00.614
Oh, no. I get it.

38:01.114 --> 38:03.242
I mean, it's not a funeral. So--

38:10.374 --> 38:12.709
You know, maybe I could drive my own car.

38:14.878 --> 38:15.963
Yes!

38:16.046 --> 38:19.383
And that way I could leave
if I'm uncomfortable or afraid.

38:19.883 --> 38:21.635
Sure, yeah. That sounds great.

38:30.143 --> 38:31.270
Hey.

38:36.108 --> 38:37.276
Did you miss me?

39:19.318 --> 39:22.988
- The elusive Mark.
- Never thought of myself as elusive.

39:24.072 --> 39:25.657
Welcome. Welcome.

39:26.200 --> 39:30.537
Okay. The reading starts in eight minutes.

39:31.121 --> 39:33.874
Mark, you've got your copy
to follow along, yes?

39:34.917 --> 39:38.795
I-- You know, I think I left it by my bed.

39:40.339 --> 39:41.673
Shoot. Really?

39:42.341 --> 39:44.426
- Okay, shoot!
- Indeed. Yeah, I'm sorry.

39:44.510 --> 39:47.471
And it's a 15-minute drive back,
so you could still catch--

39:48.222 --> 39:49.681
You know what? It's fine.

39:49.765 --> 39:51.016
- Unless you want to.
- Well…

39:51.099 --> 39:52.351
My friends.

39:52.434 --> 39:53.685
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:53.769 --> 39:56.063
Baby's first party for Daddy.

39:56.146 --> 39:57.814
Look, she's so drunk.

39:57.898 --> 39:59.733
So there is so much food in there.

39:59.816 --> 40:03.237
Rebeck! She may be willing
to share her copy with you.

40:03.320 --> 40:06.490
But I should ask her directly,
or she might be offended.

40:06.573 --> 40:08.200
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

40:09.076 --> 40:10.994
- He is on it.
- I know.

40:11.995 --> 40:13.872
- Sister and brother.
- Alone at last.

40:13.956 --> 40:16.041
Gross.
Hey, do you wanna give me your coat?

40:17.751 --> 40:18.836
This is nice.

40:18.919 --> 40:20.045
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:20.796 --> 40:24.633
- You're a good wife and mother and stuff.
- Thanks.

40:24.716 --> 40:26.885
Oh, yeah. All glory unto Devon.

40:26.969 --> 40:29.054
Yeah, all glory, and screw you.

40:29.555 --> 40:31.807
- Hey, we should talk later.
- Yeah?

40:31.890 --> 40:35.644
Yeah. I've been pondering
a decently-sized life change.

40:35.727 --> 40:36.770
Uh-oh.

40:36.854 --> 40:39.481
Well, I gotta float around and host,
but thank you for being here.

40:39.565 --> 40:40.899
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- Come here.

40:43.986 --> 40:45.445
Watch for leakies, Mark.

40:45.529 --> 40:47.364
Hi, Mrs. Selvig.

41:19.688 --> 41:21.315
<i>But, Mark,</i>

41:21.398 --> 41:24.401
I am sorry I was so terse before.

41:24.484 --> 41:25.694
Oh, no, no, no.

41:27.696 --> 41:30.449
I just had a bad day at the shop.

41:30.532 --> 41:34.745
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
But it's-- Glad you're here now.

41:35.996 --> 41:37.164
Yeah.

41:38.415 --> 41:40.542
Work's just work, right?

41:45.422 --> 41:46.840
Yes.

42:23.377 --> 42:24.378
Okay.

42:27.464 --> 42:32.761
Okay, "Trackball, track--
Flip timing switch. Type in. Trackball."

42:33.679 --> 42:35.722
Okay, so this is--

42:35.806 --> 42:38.183
Where's-- Where's MDR?

42:39.893 --> 42:41.562
Shift.

42:45.482 --> 42:46.984
Manage.

42:48.110 --> 42:49.444
Confirm. Okay.

42:55.158 --> 42:56.285
That's--

43:00.914 --> 43:02.833
"Function." Boom.

43:07.087 --> 43:09.840
Okay. Helly R.

43:13.552 --> 43:15.137
Come on. Come on. Come on.

43:15.846 --> 43:16.680
Mark.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.642
All right. Irving.

43:43.457 --> 43:44.416
Fuck.

43:45.125 --> 43:46.335
Okay, "flip."

43:48.212 --> 43:50.506
Irving, Helly, Mark.

43:54.009 --> 43:55.302
Well, anyway, I should probabl--

43:55.385 --> 43:57.513
- I don't mean to be nosy, but…
- No, no.

43:57.596 --> 44:01.600
…I heard you say to Devon something
about a life change?

44:05.229 --> 44:10.234
Well, I was gonna have
a talk with her about my job actually.

44:11.235 --> 44:12.361
At Lumon?

44:12.444 --> 44:13.445
Yeah.

44:14.238 --> 44:18.534
I was gonna tell her that
I'm thinking I might quit.

44:20.953 --> 44:21.954
Quit?

44:25.332 --> 44:26.583
"Beehive."

44:28.961 --> 44:31.255
"Lullaby, open house, overtime."

44:31.338 --> 44:32.464
Yes.

44:32.548 --> 44:34.049
Are you serious?

44:34.550 --> 44:36.093
Yeah. I just--

44:37.678 --> 44:39.513
This severance thing, it…

44:42.099 --> 44:43.767
Not sure I need it anymore.

44:56.947 --> 44:57.948
Okay.

44:59.616 --> 45:01.952
"Now find… A."

45:05.497 --> 45:06.331
Great.

45:06.415 --> 45:07.708
Do it.

45:08.709 --> 45:09.960
Shit.

45:12.629 --> 45:13.964
Come on.

45:14.047 --> 45:17.467
Get away from them, Mark.

45:25.934 --> 45:27.227
Come here.
