WHAT'S WRONG?
THAT'S A GOOD THING, RIGHT?

28:12.500 --> 28:13.667
THAT MEANS
I CAN COME WITH YOU.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.834
NO.
NO, YOU CAN'T.

28:15.917 --> 28:17.083
YES, I CAN.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.250
IF I CAN SEE THE LIGHT
AND I AM,

28:18.333 --> 28:19.875
THEN IT'S MEANT TO BE.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.375
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

28:22.458 --> 28:25.709
I --
I LOVE YOU.

28:25.792 --> 28:27.792
I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.
WE CAN BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.917
STOP IT. OKAY? KARA.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.500
KARA, DON'T!

28:31.583 --> 28:34.291
WHY HASN'T THIS HEART
STARTED BEATING YET?

28:38.291 --> 28:39.959
CAN WE CARDIO CONVERT?

28:40.041 --> 28:42.500
COME ON, KARA.
YOU STAY WITH ME.

28:42.583 --> 28:43.792

<i>EMMA, THE WORLD'S WORST</i>
<i>RELATIONSHIP COUNSELOR.</i>

FOR THE RECORD, I'M NOT
EVEN SORRY ABOUT THIS.

28:57.917 --> 29:00.125
SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT
ABOUT DELANEY EVENTUALLY.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.834
HOW WOULD SHE
HAVE FOUND OUT?

29:01.917 --> 29:04.166
WELL, I PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE TOLD HER.

29:04.250 --> 29:05.917
NICE.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.208
WELL, YOU WERE WITH THIS GIRL
FOR WHAT, OVER A YEAR?

29:08.291 --> 29:10.166
SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY
VERY SERIOUS ABOUT YOU.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.875
AND I'M SERIOUS
ABOUT HER, TOO.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.375
WHEN WE MET ONLINE,

29:13.500 --> 29:15.250
WE DIDN'T JUST CONNECT,
WE REALLY CONNECTED.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.000
SHE KNOWS ME
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.417
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

29:18.500 --> 29:19.750
YOU'RE FINE WITH TYPING IT,

29:19.834 --> 29:20.959
BUT YOU CAN'T HANDLE
THE REAL THING?

29:21.041 --> 29:24.041
NO.
OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS CAN'T.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.834
TWO PEOPLE WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS
CAN'T BE TOGETHER, EMMA.

29:26.917 --> 29:29.750
TECHNICALLY, WE'RE NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.583
IF WE CONTAMINATE
EACH OTHER,

29:31.667 --> 29:33.709
IT CREATES
A BAD-BACTERIA SITUATION,

29:33.792 --> 29:35.500
AND ANTIBIOTICS
CAN'T FIX IT.

29:35.583 --> 29:37.875
WELL, WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"CAN'T FIX IT"?

29:37.959 --> 29:39.333
DEATH.
THE GRIM REAPER.

29:39.417 --> 29:40.500
THE BIG SLEEP.

29:40.583 --> 29:41.959
ME AND MAE ARE "TWILIGHT,"

29:42.041 --> 29:44.250
AND WE COULD ACTUALLY
KILL EACH OTHER.

29:50.917 --> 29:52.291
SO, I'M ALL PACKED UP.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.917
IF WE LEAVE NOW, WE CAN
BE HOME IN FOUR HOURS.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.542
TRAFFIC'S BETTER AT NIGHT.

29:56.625 --> 30:00.000
OR WE CAN LEAVE TOMORROW,
AND WE CAN GO STAY WITH --

30:00.083 --> 30:02.125
WHAT?

30:02.208 --> 30:05.125
THIS IS HOW YOU WERE
WHEN YOU LEFT --

30:05.208 --> 30:07.500
MAKING LISTS,
MAKING PLANS.

30:07.583 --> 30:10.166
I KNOW,
BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

30:10.250 --> 30:12.291
MAYBE THIS IS A MISTAKE,
TOO.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.291
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW.

30:14.375 --> 30:17.375
YOU NEVER WANTED ME TO COME HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:17.458 --> 30:21.417
TO RUN AWAY FROM ME, NO.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.542
ALL I WANTED WAS FOR YOU
TO HAVE FAITH.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.166
NO. NO, ABUELA.

30:25.250 --> 30:27.542
YOU WANTED ME TO BELIEVE
WHAT YOU BELIEVE, AND I DON'T.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.542
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

30:29.625 --> 30:34.041
WHEN YOU GOT SICK,
I SAW HOW SCARED YOU WERE.

30:34.125 --> 30:37.500
BUT WHEN I SAW YOU STOPPED
BELIEVING -- IN ME,

30:37.583 --> 30:41.250
IN ANYTHING -- THAT'S
WHEN I TRULY LOST HOPE.

30:41.333 --> 30:45.333
THEN WHEN YOU LEFT,
YOU WEREN'T SCARED ANYMORE.

30:45.417 --> 30:47.250
YOU WERE JUST ANGRY.

30:49.750 --> 30:55.125
BUT I COULD ALSO SEE
THAT YOUR FAITH WAS BACK,

30:55.208 --> 30:58.000
THAT YOU BELIEVED
IN THIS DOCTOR HERE

30:58.083 --> 31:01.375
WHO WAS GOING TO CURE YOU
AND MAKE YOU WELL.

31:01.458 --> 31:07.166
AND ONCE AGAIN,
YOU HAVE LOST THAT FAITH.

31:09.709 --> 31:14.583
I JUST...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

31:19.291 --> 31:24.000
THIS MORNING, WHEN
WE WERE HERE PRAYING,

31:24.083 --> 31:26.583
DID YOU FEEL ANYTHING?

31:26.667 --> 31:30.917
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.083
MOSTLY, I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

31:33.166 --> 31:36.083
HMM.
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

31:36.166 --> 31:38.208
[ LAUGHS ]

31:38.291 --> 31:39.750
[ INHALES ]

31:39.834 --> 31:42.000
DESPAIR IS A GREAT SIN,
YOU KNOW.

31:42.083 --> 31:45.959
BUT WHEN WE THINK
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE --

31:46.041 --> 31:49.125
WHEN WE THINK
ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE LOVE,

31:49.208 --> 31:50.875
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.291
I'M STILL SCARED.

31:57.375 --> 32:00.125
I KNOW THAT.

32:02.959 --> 32:07.500
SO, A CRAZY THOUGHT FOR THIS
WEEKEND -- SANTA BARBARA.

32:07.583 --> 32:11.250
ALL THAT
SIDEWAYS WINE COUNTRY.

32:11.333 --> 32:12.917
I MEAN, IF I'M
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I SHOULD ACTUALLY GET
TO SEE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

32:15.083 --> 32:17.583
A ROAD TRIP
UP THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY

32:17.667 --> 32:19.834
IS ONE OF THOSE QUINTESSENTIALLY
AMERICAN THINGS TO DO.

32:19.917 --> 32:21.500
I DON'T THINK
I'M GOING TO BE UP

32:21.583 --> 32:23.834
FOR A ROAD TRIP
TO SANTA BARBARA THIS WEEKEND.

32:23.917 --> 32:26.000
SO, UH, VEGAS?
PALM SPRINGS?

32:26.083 --> 32:28.166
WHAT ABOUT
THE GRAND CANYON?

32:28.250 --> 32:29.834
YOU CAN STOP THIS
AT ANY POINT.

32:29.917 --> 32:31.083
STOP WHAT?

32:31.166 --> 32:33.667
WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROVE.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.500
YOU SAID YOU WERE STILL
UP FOR HAVING DINNER
THIS WEEKEND.

32:35.583 --> 32:37.333
WELL, NOW
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

32:37.417 --> 32:39.291
ALL I WANT IS
TO HAVE OUR FIRST DATE

32:39.375 --> 32:40.709
WHEN ALL THIS IS OVER

32:40.792 --> 32:42.542
AND EVERYTHING'S GONE BACK
TO NORMAL.

32:42.625 --> 32:44.166
ALL THIS WHAT?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.291
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

32:48.375 --> 32:50.500
I HAVE TO GO
TO A FUNERAL TODAY.

32:50.583 --> 32:53.792
OH, I SEE.

32:53.875 --> 32:56.542
SO TODAY IS NOT LIKE
ANY OTHER DAY?

33:05.375 --> 33:07.625
WAIT, WAIT.
ARE WE FIGHTING?

33:07.709 --> 33:10.041
LOOKS THAT WAY.
[ LAUGHS ] FANTASTIC.

33:12.625 --> 33:14.542

IS THE FIRST TIME TODAY

33:14.625 --> 33:16.291
YOU'VE BEEN
REMOTELY REAL WITH ME.

33:16.375 --> 33:18.458
WHY DO WE HAVE TO BE REAL?
WE BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER.

33:18.542 --> 33:20.333
YOU'RE RIGHT.
FOR INSTANCE, I DID NOT KNOW

33:20.417 --> 33:21.500
YOU WERE GOING
TO A FUNERAL TODAY

33:21.583 --> 33:22.583
BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

MAYBE I COULD HELP IN SOME WAY.

33:30.959 --> 33:32.917
AND TRYING TO GET
TO KNOW YOU BETTER

33:33.000 --> 33:34.709

TO WAIT

UNTIL ALL THIS IS OVER

33:36.125 --> 33:37.834
AND EVERYTHING'S
GONE BACK NORMAL

33:37.917 --> 33:39.625
BEFORE WE HAVE
OUR FIRST DATE,

THAT NEVER HAPPENS.

AND IT PASSES YOU BY.

BEFORE VALENTINE'S DAY,

AND IT IS WEIRD,
AND IT IS AWKWARD,

33:58.834 --> 34:01.500

OF THE STORY OF HOW YOU MET.

TO SAYING
