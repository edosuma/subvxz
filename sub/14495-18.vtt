00:01.401 --> 00:02.701
Tony, wait!

00:02.702 --> 00:04.702
I joined the Avengers to help people...

00:04.703 --> 00:06.003
including the villains.

00:06.804 --> 00:08.404
You don't like other fighting,
i get it...

00:08.405 --> 00:10.305
but maybe could you help the team
in other ways.

00:10.606 --> 00:12.906
You're a genius Hank.
We need you.

00:12.907 --> 00:15.307
I'm done with the Avengers.
This isn't me anymore.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.108
No.

00:17.109 --> 00:20.609
You're Ant Man!
Walking away isn't gonna help anyone!

00:20.810 --> 00:22.810
can't you se how much this is hurting me?

00:24.211 --> 00:26.011
Are you kidding me?!

00:26.012 --> 00:27.312
Hank!

00:34.813 --> 00:37.313
Wow! Did a gamma bomb go off in here?

00:37.314 --> 00:39.114
****

00:39.315 --> 00:42.015
He's a genius but Hank is,
a total slob...

00:42.016 --> 00:43.616
- when he's in...
- Must be somewhere.

00:43.617 --> 00:45.816
- work mode.
- Hello?

00:45.817 --> 00:48.117
Tony, you came!

00:49.118 --> 00:51.318
Jan? I'm...

00:51.919 --> 00:53.519
I'm not ready ***

00:53.520 --> 00:55.120
This really doesn't concern you.

00:55.921 --> 00:57.621
Nice to see you too, Hank

00:58.622 --> 01:00.822
*** appetizer...

01:00.823 --> 01:03.323
What's this little tech miracle
you're so *** me to see?

01:03.324 --> 01:05.724
Little, yes and huge!.

01:05.725 --> 01:07.725
It's my next generation Big House.

01:07.726 --> 01:09.026
You've got to see this

01:09.027 --> 01:11.327
That's interesting but kind of unnecessary...

01:11.328 --> 01:13.128
Now that HYDRA base is in on line

01:13.129 --> 01:16.129
Besides, the Big House didn't turn out
so well last time.

01:16.130 --> 01:18.330
- Remember?
- But this time, i'm the warden!

01:18.331 --> 01:21.131
I will be in control of the prison!

01:21.132 --> 01:23.132
I'll make sure nothing goes wrong.

01:23.133 --> 01:26.133
Hank, i was glad to get your call
but to be honest...

01:26.134 --> 01:27.934
this is a disaster waiting to happen.

01:27.935 --> 01:29.535
When's the last time you slept?

01:29.536 --> 01:31.536
or ate anything besides pizza?

01:32.537 --> 01:35.537
And tell me this is not
an *** quantum anihilator!

01:36.538 --> 01:39.138
and much more
this micro prison...

01:39.139 --> 01:41.239
Hey Hank, why don't we work on this
at Stark Tower ?

01:41.240 --> 01:43.240
It wouldn't hurt you to be around friends.

01:43.241 --> 01:45.541
And in a safer location.

01:45.542 --> 01:47.542
No!
This lab is safe !

01:48.043 --> 01:50.543
*** keep an eye on things
***

01:50.544 --> 01:52.844
Easy, Hank!
set down the very dangerous...

01:52.845 --> 01:55.145
science thing and talk to us.

01:55.146 --> 01:57.946
You know what?
This was a bad idea.

01:58.647 --> 02:00.947
- Why don't you live?
- Hank?

02:01.248 --> 02:02.548
Now.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.249
It's great to see Pym
is doing so well without us.

02:06.250 --> 02:09.750
Tony, i know Hank didn't leave the Avengers
on the best of terms, but...

02:09.751 --> 02:11.751
I think he may need help.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.852
Hank?

02:16.853 --> 02:18.153
Are you allright?

02:20.154 --> 02:22.354
Oh No. Oh No!

02:23.055 --> 02:24.355
Hank!

02:25.356 --> 02:28.356
Subtitles: nakor38

02:29.000 --> 02:31.009
And there came a day unlike any other

02:31.010 --> 02:32.732
When Earth mightiest heroes...

02:32.733 --> 02:35.315
found themselves united against a common threat

02:35.316 --> 02:38.473
on that day, they became the Avengers.

02:38.474 --> 02:40.484
The invincible armored Iron Man

02:40.485 --> 02:42.684
Thor, prince of thunder

02:42.685 --> 02:45.365
The Hulk, strongest hero there is

02:45.366 --> 02:48.522
and Captain America, the first Avenger

02:48.523 --> 02:51.775
Assembled, we are strong!

02:51.776 --> 02:55.126
forever fight as one

02:55.127 --> 02:57.520
Avengers assemble

03:04.322 --> 03:06.322
We didn't come here to remember an Avenger.

03:06.323 --> 03:08.523
or a  scientist.
or a man.

03:08.524 --> 03:10.324
We came to remember a dreamer.

03:10.325 --> 03:12.325
Who gave his life, trying to make the world...

03:12.326 --> 03:13.626
a safer place.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.627
taken from us too soon.

03:16.228 --> 03:18.128
We will never forget our friend.

03:18.129 --> 03:19.629
Dr. Henry Pym.

03:31.930 --> 03:34.030
Death comes to all, eventually.

03:34.031 --> 03:37.531
I know, but that's the first time
that was one of us.

03:37.532 --> 03:39.832
I didn't think it would happen like this.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.533
It was a noble speech, Stark.

03:42.534 --> 03:44.834
Worthy of the songs in Valhala.

03:45.335 --> 03:48.435
Pepper wrote it.
I'm not really good with the sensitive.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.936
Even though Hank and i didn't always agree...

03:50.937 --> 03:52.937
i meant every word.

03:53.538 --> 03:55.938
I wish he'd been able to finish what he started.

03:57.239 --> 03:59.239
I wish i could have told him...

03:59.740 --> 04:01.740
Hank knew how you felt about him.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.541
He felt the same.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.342
He just got lost.

04:10.343 --> 04:11.943
Miss Van Dyne?

04:11.944 --> 04:13.944
My condolences.

04:14.745 --> 04:16.045
Fury?

04:16.245 --> 04:19.546
Yeah.
keeping a low profile nowadays

04:19.846 --> 04:22.147
I was hoping to have a word 
in private with Stark.

04:22.148 --> 04:24.548
Great timer as always, Fury.

04:24.549 --> 04:25.849
What do you want?

04:25.850 --> 04:27.350
sorry to be blunt...

04:27.351 --> 04:29.351
there no easy way to say this.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.752
The explosion in Pym's lab...

04:31.753 --> 04:33.353
wasn't an accident.

04:36.254 --> 04:38.154
It was murder.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.455
SHIELD agents found it 
in the wreckage of the lab

04:41.456 --> 04:44.456
A detonator.
Hank was killed.

04:44.457 --> 04:47.157
Fury happened to see who did it
with his good eye?

04:47.158 --> 04:48.758
Otherwise, we're running blind.

04:49.059 --> 04:50.759
JARVIS, scan the device...

04:50.760 --> 04:52.760
and access Hank's remote backup drives.

04:52.761 --> 04:54.061
Yes sir

04:55.062 --> 04:58.562
Most recent file activity was concentrated
on the Serpent Society

04:58.563 --> 05:01.363
It had to be them!
what are we waiting around for?

05:01.364 --> 05:02.764
According to SHIELD...

05:02.765 --> 05:05.165
the micro prison prototype
wasn't in the wreckage.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.966
You think the Serpents stole it?

05:06.967 --> 05:09.167
It's the first thing that makes sense
about all this.

05:09.168 --> 05:12.068
Start to show these things
why we're called the Avengers

05:12.069 --> 05:13.369
JARVIS?

05:13.370 --> 05:16.370
Dr Pym's records show
the whereabouts of the Constrictor.

05:16.371 --> 05:18.671
Somewhere in the vicinity of Yancy Street

05:18.672 --> 05:19.972
He's slippery.

05:19.973 --> 05:21.973
We don't want them to ***
before they're collared.

05:21.974 --> 05:24.374
Panther, you want for a quiet hunt ?

05:24.375 --> 05:25.675
What about me?

05:26.376 --> 05:28.376
Jan, maybe it's too soon.

05:28.377 --> 05:30.377
You'll get your chance
I promise, but...

05:45.378 --> 05:48.078
This was the last of the safehouses
in Pym's files.

05:48.079 --> 05:49.379
Anything?

05:49.380 --> 05:51.080
Heat traces...

05:51.681 --> 05:53.481
less than five minutes old.

05:53.482 --> 05:54.782
we're close.

05:58.883 --> 06:01.183
I'll give you whatever you want!

06:01.784 --> 06:03.384
Just let me go!

06:03.385 --> 06:06.085
What i want is to see scum like you...

06:06.086 --> 06:07.686
punished once and for all!

06:12.487 --> 06:14.087
Who are you?

06:14.888 --> 06:16.888
the name's Yellow Jacket.

06:21.889 --> 06:23.889
We'll take over from here, friend.

06:24.390 --> 06:25.690
Scanning.

06:25.691 --> 06:27.991
Energy signature analyzed.

06:27.992 --> 06:29.292
Identity unknown.

06:30.593 --> 06:32.293
The mighty Avengers.

06:32.594 --> 06:34.394
You're going to scan him?

06:34.795 --> 06:36.895
We're certainly not disintegrating him.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.896
Which is exactly why the world
needs someone like me!

06:39.897 --> 06:41.897
Willing to do whatever it takes!

06:48.598 --> 06:49.898
Who are you?

06:51.599 --> 06:52.899
Not so fast!

06:53.900 --> 06:55.200
Stings, doesn't it?

06:55.201 --> 06:57.801
Maybe it will help you
remember to stay out of my way

06:59.002 --> 07:00.602
I've got work to do.

07:04.003 --> 07:05.303
No!

07:09.604 --> 07:11.304
You're gonna be sorry you did that!

07:18.905 --> 07:21.405
Hope that wasn't too soon for you guys.

07:22.706 --> 07:24.706
Jan, wait!

07:25.407 --> 07:27.307
You think you can get away from me ?

07:30.708 --> 07:32.708
Do you realize what you've done ?

07:32.709 --> 07:35.709
Constrictor was our only lead
to finding out who killed Hank!

07:35.710 --> 07:39.210
So, Pym was the weak link in your little club.

07:39.211 --> 07:40.611
Better off without him.

07:43.912 --> 07:45.612
You don't know anything abut him!

07:46.613 --> 07:48.613
I knew enough to get rid of the guy.

07:48.614 --> 07:49.914
What?

07:59.515 --> 08:01.015
Be careful, little wasp

08:01.516 --> 08:03.416
I have a nasty sting too.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.717
You can't stop me.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.218
Hank?

08:28.719 --> 08:30.319
Who is Yellow Jacket?

08:30.320 --> 08:31.920
Is your helmet on too tight?

08:31.921 --> 08:33.221
I just told you!

08:33.422 --> 08:35.222
Yellow Jacket is Hank Pym.

08:35.222 --> 08:38.523
We heard you Jan, but it's a tough thing to swallow

08:38.524 --> 08:40.124
Not to mention impossible.

08:40.125 --> 08:41.825
Or highly improbable.

08:41.826 --> 08:43.326
I compared the scans.

08:43.327 --> 08:45.627
Different size, body shape.

08:46.328 --> 08:48.328
Even the technology in Yellow Jacket's costume...

08:48.329 --> 08:50.129
carries a different energy signature.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.830
Jan, we're all upset about Hank...

08:52.831 --> 08:54.431
but think about it.

08:54.432 --> 08:56.432
Think about what he did with the Constrictor.

08:57.133 --> 08:58.433
Hank was a pacifist.

08:58.434 --> 09:00.834
This dude can't possibly be the man we know.

09:02.535 --> 09:04.335
I know what i heard.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.636
what i felt.

09:15.637 --> 09:17.637
You think i'm crazy too?

09:17.638 --> 09:19.338
No one thinks you're crazy.

09:19.339 --> 09:21.639
We'd all like to believe Hank isn't gone.

09:21.640 --> 09:25.440
- But look at the evidence, Jan.
- I know, but...

09:25.441 --> 09:27.041
If it was him?

09:27.042 --> 09:29.542
If he somehow altered himself?

09:29.543 --> 09:31.443
Don't we owe him a chance?

09:33.844 --> 09:36.844
You, westerners and your obsession with television.

09:36.845 --> 09:39.745
Wouldn't you be better served tracking down
Dr Pym's assailant? 

09:39.746 --> 09:42.746
Eh, you do research your way
i do it mine.

09:42.747 --> 09:44.047
Check it.

09:44.048 --> 09:46.748
And who is the new mystery man
Yellow Jacket?

09:46.749 --> 09:48.149
Friend or foe?

09:48.650 --> 09:52.150
*** he's no friend to the Serpent Society

09:52.751 --> 09:54.651
get stunned by the Yellow Jacket

09:54.652 --> 09:56.452
***

09:58.753 --> 10:00.453
Sounds like a hero to me.

10:00.454 --> 10:02.454
And what the Avengers have to say.

10:02.455 --> 10:05.255
No comment, and get that camera off my face!

10:07.256 --> 10:09.256
When it's good news Tony always ...

10:09.257 --> 10:11.257
gets interviewed looking like a movie star.

10:11.258 --> 10:13.258
when it's bad news, they ambush me!

10:13.259 --> 10:14.859
It never fails.

10:14.860 --> 10:17.860
Pardon me Avengers
but Yellow Jacket has been found.

10:18.261 --> 10:19.561
by Thor.

10:20.062 --> 10:22.562
We should hurry
or we'll miss all the action.

10:25.563 --> 10:27.563
Get out of my way!

10:30.564 --> 10:32.664
I'm not going to beg for mercy!

10:32.665 --> 10:34.465
You wouldn't get any!

10:42.466 --> 10:44.066
When you struck down, Pym...

10:44.067 --> 10:46.067
you earned my ire, mortal!

10:46.068 --> 10:47.968
Lay down your arms and surrender!

10:47.969 --> 10:49.469
I don't think so!

10:57.070 --> 10:59.470
Instead of attacking me
you guys should be thanking me!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.540
The math is simple, blondie.

11:02.541 --> 11:06.165
Bad guys plus Yellow Jacket
equals no more bad guys.

11:07.569 --> 11:09.335
Irritating insect!

11:17.925 --> 11:20.990
Looks like Thor isn't having
any better luck than we did.

11:20.991 --> 11:22.798
He can dodge lightning?

11:22.799 --> 11:24.450
Guy knows what he's doing.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.076
Let's end this.
And Jan...

11:26.392 --> 11:30.205
If you tell me to sit this one out
I'll *** you in your stupid metal face.

11:30.942 --> 11:33.610
I was going to tell you
to hit him with everything you've got.

11:33.611 --> 11:35.533
No matter who you think he is.

11:39.914 --> 11:41.960
Nowhere to run, mortal!

11:52.647 --> 11:54.685
Getting mad and throwing lightning bolts...

11:54.686 --> 11:57.047
a real *** strategy to crack.

12:02.815 --> 12:05.661
Next he'll probably brag about his hammer.

12:08.606 --> 12:11.081
Face the wrath of Mjölnir!

12:15.242 --> 12:16.915
Wasp, wait!

12:22.155 --> 12:24.713
And in the blink of an eye
I'm in control.

12:24.714 --> 12:27.978
- And you're finished Thor
- Impossible.

12:29.012 --> 12:30.799
Very possible.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.115
Hank!

12:36.369 --> 12:37.764
Thor!

12:41.847 --> 12:43.680
You should have just left me alone.

12:43.681 --> 12:45.399
I had it under control!

12:45.400 --> 12:47.407
No you didn't
You never did.

12:47.408 --> 12:49.204
You're not Yellow Jacket.

12:49.689 --> 12:51.407
You're Hank Pym.

12:54.099 --> 12:56.034
Hank, you need help.

12:56.035 --> 12:58.573
Me? I just shot down an Asgardian!

12:58.574 --> 13:00.439
You said i wasn't tough ehough!

13:00.440 --> 13:02.475
Looks like i'm tougher than all of you!

13:02.979 --> 13:05.318
Don't even Clint, I mean it.

13:05.319 --> 13:07.184
None of you can stop me.

13:07.185 --> 13:08.987
You can't shoot all of us at once.

13:09.598 --> 13:11.130
He doesn't know what he's doing.

13:11.131 --> 13:13.024
Please, just stop it, Hank.

13:14.818 --> 13:16.625
Hank Pym is dead.

13:17.227 --> 13:19.292
Sorry you feel that way, Yellow Jacket.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.804
Look what you did!

13:49.805 --> 13:51.871
- Idiots!
- What we did?

13:51.872 --> 13:54.346
- You killed Thor!
- Nay, my friend!

13:54.347 --> 13:57.707
Though he did cause me some minor discomfort.

13:57.708 --> 13:59.547
I didn't kill anyone.

13:59.548 --> 14:02.532
My pistol places objects directly 
into my new micro-prison.

14:02.951 --> 14:05.587
Where we are now trapped 
because of you people.

14:06.001 --> 14:08.288
You mean we're stuck inside your gun?

14:08.289 --> 14:11.251
King Cobra, Bushmaster, Rattler.

14:12.392 --> 14:15.226
Death Adder,Anaconda, Constrictor.

14:15.227 --> 14:16.954
This is sadistic, Hank!

14:16.955 --> 14:19.255
You used to dream of rehabilitating criminals.

14:19.256 --> 14:20.945
I'm not Hank!

14:20.946 --> 14:23.476
I'm everything Pym could not be.

14:23.814 --> 14:25.777
I'm sorry, you were right Jan.

14:25.778 --> 14:27.872
But in about 3 seconds, i'm taking him off. 

14:27.873 --> 14:31.227
- Whoever he thinks he is.
- Hank, i know you're still in there.

14:31.228 --> 14:33.277
You've got to stop it before...

14:38.438 --> 14:39.827
Now what?

14:39.828 --> 14:42.390
The Pym particles of your prison
are unstable at this size.

14:42.391 --> 14:44.212
The place is shrinking uncontrollably.

14:44.213 --> 14:45.831
But we're not shrinking with it.

14:45.832 --> 14:48.941
- It's going to crush us
- The pistol was the gateway.

14:48.942 --> 14:51.798
- There's no way out.
- So fix it!

14:51.799 --> 14:53.716
This problem isn't going to be fixed by someone...

14:53.717 --> 14:56.880
in a yellow clown suit
who wants to solve anything by fighting!

14:56.881 --> 14:58.698
I need someone who uses science.

14:58.699 --> 15:00.300
Who uses his brain.

15:03.294 --> 15:05.297
We need you, Hank Pym!

15:29.994 --> 15:31.349
Cobra, hold out!

15:31.350 --> 15:33.784
If we don't act quickly, we'll all be crushed.

15:33.785 --> 15:36.326
It's your choice, fight us
and we're finished.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.770
Or we work together to get out of this mess.

15:39.451 --> 15:41.951
Serpent Society, attack!

15:42.845 --> 15:44.764
Avangers Assemble!

16:09.286 --> 16:11.145
We don't have time for this!

16:19.368 --> 16:21.228
Where is Dr Pym.

16:21.229 --> 16:23.736
Pym can't come to the rescue right now.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.534
And you're welcome, Stark.

16:50.747 --> 16:53.168
Priorities, Bushmaster, come on!

17:18.188 --> 17:21.277
Time to move****guys

17:21.278 --> 17:23.400
The prison is imploding into a singularity.

17:23.401 --> 17:25.382
If we don't get out of here fast, it's over

17:25.383 --> 17:28.637
- You're the genius, genius.
- Not for this kind of thing.

17:28.638 --> 17:30.073
Stand back *** , Hank!

17:31.327 --> 17:32.640
Wasp!

17:33.217 --> 17:36.499
Somebody closer and i pull the bug's wings out.

17:37.587 --> 17:39.628
Or maybe i'll just do it anyway

17:39.629 --> 17:40.936
Jan!

17:51.136 --> 17:52.451
Hank?

17:52.452 --> 17:55.276
- Jan...
- Hank!

18:08.488 --> 18:10.213
Panther, your ID card.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.351
It still has the scan of me from earlier?

18:12.352 --> 18:13.697
I need it.

18:15.752 --> 18:18.290
Tony, give me access to your chest reactor.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.806
Not so fast.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.098
I build a micro-prison around my bio signature.

18:22.099 --> 18:23.912
So only i could access.

18:23.913 --> 18:26.032
If we could relay my bio signature 
from Panther's card... 

18:26.033 --> 18:27.347
to your chest reactor...

18:27.348 --> 18:29.217
it'll explode like a wave motion field...

18:29.218 --> 18:32.454
- and transport us out of here..
- Sure, why didn't i think that?

18:33.384 --> 18:36.298
Tony, that reactor is keeping your heart going.

18:36.299 --> 18:38.586
If this goes wrong, you might die.

18:39.897 --> 18:42.210
If he doesn't try, we all die.

18:45.445 --> 18:47.682
This might hurt, a lot.

18:47.683 --> 18:49.580
Thank's for telling me now.

18:49.882 --> 18:51.245
Hold on

19:31.880 --> 19:34.772
Well, we cheated death, again.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.927
Not us, him.

19:38.284 --> 19:39.748
You did it!

19:41.315 --> 19:43.285
Let's clean this mess up.

19:47.451 --> 19:50.412
The cells at HYDRA base should keep
the Society out of commission.

19:55.284 --> 19:56.990
Not a bad likeness.

19:56.991 --> 19:59.615
- We'll have to take it back down
- You should leave it.

19:59.616 --> 20:02.315
Ant Man is gone
that's the past.

20:02.316 --> 20:05.273
I think we spent too long wanting
you to be someone you weren't.

20:05.274 --> 20:07.412
Instead of appreciating who you are.

20:07.413 --> 20:10.065
You want an Avenger who gets the job done right.

20:10.066 --> 20:11.550
Here i am.

20:12.231 --> 20:14.937
Hank Pym is welcome back to the team anytime.

20:14.938 --> 20:16.637
That's what we want.

20:16.638 --> 20:18.090
I told you...

20:18.839 --> 20:20.630
The name's Yellow Jacket.

20:23.384 --> 20:25.896
- Tony...
- Absolutely not

20:25.897 --> 20:28.020
- He's your friend.
- Was.

20:28.021 --> 20:30.381
Yellow Jacket is crazy as a hornet's nest.

20:30.382 --> 20:32.075
And a loose *** in a boot.

20:32.076 --> 20:34.085
I've been an Avenger from day one.

20:34.086 --> 20:36.247
I've always been the happy camper.

20:36.801 --> 20:39.164
I never asked you for anything,Tony Stark...

20:39.165 --> 20:41.791
I'm asking now.
Take Hank back.

20:42.364 --> 20:43.717
We need him.

20:45.575 --> 20:47.179
I need him.

20:47.445 --> 20:48.783
Pardon me Sir

20:48.784 --> 20:50.606
But the New York Police Department is reporting...

20:50.607 --> 20:53.527
a crowd of mad people
spilling from  Madison Square Garden.

20:53.528 --> 20:55.786
And i don't believe there was a game today.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.662
I bet that i *** more people than you do Stark.

20:59.627 --> 21:02.030
Wait what?
Yellow Jacket!
