00:27.156 --> 00:30.156
- How can you live like this?!
- It was fine till

00:30.341 --> 00:34.084
- you guys started whining.
- Whining?! The whole temple reeks!

00:34.086 --> 00:39.406
- I found it!
- What manner of magical alloy is this?

00:40.008 --> 00:44.427
- It's a burrito.
- It's the tuna burrito from Aqua-Mexican!

00:44.429 --> 00:48.457
That place closed
like 5 years ago.

00:50.201 --> 00:53.903
Huh? What's this?
It kind of looks like you guys

00:53.905 --> 00:57.306
- and my Mom.
- Oh, Steven, that is us!

00:57.308 --> 01:00.910
- Really?
- The hard part was getting the shark to pose.

01:00.912 --> 01:04.614
- Why's everyone dressed like old-timey people?
- They are old-timey people.

01:04.616 --> 01:08.351
W-wait.
But that would mean...

01:08.353 --> 01:12.255
- How old are you guys?
- Much older than any human.

01:12.257 --> 01:17.295
- Does that mean you'll live forever?
- No, no. We don't age,

01:17.330 --> 01:22.298
but we can still get hurt and die.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.334
But not from food poisoning.

01:25.336 --> 01:28.671
I just can't believe you
guys are like a bazillion years old!

01:28.673 --> 01:32.552
How do you find a cake big
enough for all those candles?

01:32.718 --> 01:37.947
- We don't really celebrate birthdays.
- Why not?!

01:37.949 --> 01:41.250
- It's not our way.
- Well, I can't just ignore this tramesty

01:41.252 --> 01:45.788
of unjustice! I pledge that
you will have your birthdays!

01:45.790 --> 01:51.478
With all the candy, cake, and ice
cream you've been denied!

01:51.829 --> 01:56.899
And the birthday queen is...
Amethyst! I hope you like it.

01:56.901 --> 02:01.954
Dad made me this outfit and it brings
me special birthday luck every year!

Hey! It goes like this.

02:15.769 --> 02:19.310
- Lion, you're killin' me.
- Um, Steven...

02:19.345 --> 02:22.791
I know you put a lot of
effort into... putting faces on

02:22.793 --> 02:28.814
things, but could it be we're just
a tad... mature for this ritual?

02:28.816 --> 02:32.068
- Boop!
- Oh! You will remove that

02:32.070 --> 02:35.321
- this instant!
- Wait! Here!

02:35.323 --> 02:39.408
- Aww! I'll use it all the time!
- No!

02:39.410 --> 02:44.947
It's for the piñata! The piñata is
an artifact from ancient aqua Mexico.

02:48.507 --> 02:50.836
Am I... getting...

02:50.838 --> 02:54.256
- close?
- Higher.

02:58.288 --> 03:02.306
- What next, Steven?
- Well, you were supposed to get

03:02.341 --> 03:04.734
- delicious candy when you broke it open...
- Wait.

03:04.736 --> 03:08.170
- You had candy you didn't just give it to us?
- There will be more

03:08.172 --> 03:12.675
sweet treats at Pearl's party.
I promise.

03:12.676 --> 03:14.176
Happy birthday!

03:14.178 --> 03:18.314
- Honk!
- Steven, that is a brave look.

03:18.316 --> 03:21.850
- No, it's funny!
- How?

03:21.852 --> 03:25.655
Uh... Oh, geez, I'm
breaking character. Wait, wait, wait!

03:25.657 --> 03:29.825
I wrote some jokes! Why did
Pearl throw butter out the window?

03:29.827 --> 03:34.508
- You did what?
- To see a butterfly!

03:34.609 --> 03:39.905
I never did that.
Steven, are you telling lies?

03:39.906 --> 03:41.671
N-no! Oh! I know.

03:41.673 --> 03:46.752
- Pearl, do you like pie?
- I do like pie.

03:46.787 --> 03:49.699
Well, you're in luck!
I baked you a pie!

03:49.700 --> 03:54.212
- I sure hope nothing happens to it!
- Yes, me too.

03:54.213 --> 03:57.770
- Wh-whoops!
- Whoa, Steven!

03:57.772 --> 04:01.257
I've got you! Be careful.
You almost fell right on that ...

04:01.259 --> 04:05.161
See, Pearl? It's funny!

04:07.876 --> 04:11.491
Pearl says she's all partied out

04:11.526 --> 04:14.336
- and she's ready to go home.
- This isn't going

04:14.338 --> 04:16.284
at all like it should.

04:16.285 --> 04:20.176
I've got to pull out
the ultimate birthday.

04:20.178 --> 04:25.356
Okay, there's no way
you're not gonna love this!

04:25.357 --> 04:30.224
It's kazoo racers!
You get in a car, you play a kazoo ...

04:30.259 --> 04:33.180
What more could you want?

04:33.215 --> 04:35.825
- Dad used to do this for me every year.
- I think this is why

04:35.827 --> 04:40.863
- aging makes humans die.
- Steven, thank you for the birthday parties,

04:40.865 --> 04:44.767
-  but I don't think we'll need any more.
- Why not?

04:44.769 --> 04:48.037
Our age is only an illusion.
And Pearl's pretty sure this ritual is

04:48.039 --> 04:50.840
- more for human children.
- Nothing against children!

04:50.842 --> 04:54.332
Children? Everyone
gets to have birthdays!

04:54.333 --> 04:57.636
Seriously. Give it a try!
You're never too old!

04:57.637 --> 05:00.750
- We're just too big.
- You're not too big.

05:00.752 --> 05:06.224
- Y-y-you just get in and then, uh...
- I can fit!

05:06.259 --> 05:10.378
Which way to the baby war?
Eat tread, dirtbags!

05:10.413 --> 05:13.553
What if birthdays are
just for little kids?

05:13.588 --> 05:20.258
- What if even I'm too old?
- No way. You totally fit!

05:20.804 --> 05:24.499
Oh, my bad.
You are too old.

05:24.534 --> 05:27.109
- Are you okay?
- I just need to think.

05:27.111 --> 05:30.696
Kazoo racers suddenly seems undignified.

05:34.394 --> 05:38.921
I never realized birthdays meant leaving
things behind. All these parties...

05:38.923 --> 05:41.729
Ugh! So embarrassing.

05:49.971 --> 05:52.885
Oh, onion... so young, so innocent.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.297
Whackerman Jr.! Aww...

05:58.332 --> 06:01.894
I can't be seen playing childish
games like Whackerman Jr.

06:01.895 --> 06:06.198
I better stick to sophisticated
games like regular Whackerman.

06:06.200 --> 06:10.619
<i>It's whackin' time!
You're gonna get whacked! Ohh!</i>

06:10.621 --> 06:17.159
That was fun, but a
boy on the cusp of manhood

06:17.161 --> 06:19.896
can't spend the whole day whackering.

06:19.897 --> 06:22.631
I need to take control of my life.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.451
<i>It's time to get a proper job!</i>

06:25.452 --> 06:28.270
But which one? Surf master?

06:28.272 --> 06:31.974
No. Love doctor?
I'm too squeamish.

06:31.976 --> 06:36.312
Ah!
Now this is the job for me.

06:36.314 --> 06:42.430
Ha. This day went so
fast. I need a pick-me-up!

06:44.755 --> 06:50.125
- Two of the usual, please! I've had quite a day.
- You must be confused, pal.

06:50.127 --> 06:54.505
I work here every day and I've
never seen your mug before.

06:54.506 --> 06:55.965
Oh, hardy-har, Lars!

06:55.967 --> 06:58.955
- Huh?
- I used to make jokes!

06:58.990 --> 07:01.622
But you know what?
I've had a lot of time to think today,

07:01.623 --> 07:05.747
and sometimes you got to
smarten up, act like an adult.

07:05.782 --> 07:07.340
'Cause one day, if you don't,

07:07.341 --> 07:10.293
<i>everyone you know is
gonna grow up without you!</i>

07:10.328 --> 07:13.356
And you won't have
little Steven to pick on

07:13.357 --> 07:16.385
anymore because I'll
be a grown-up, too!

07:17.597 --> 07:22.667
- Steven who?
- Steven Quartz Universe!

07:22.702 --> 07:25.277
And I want that
doughnut, right there! Oh!

07:26.526 --> 07:30.266
- Sir! A-are you okay?
- I'm old!

07:30.268 --> 07:34.923
- Yeah, and nuts.
- I'm gonna have to eat fiber cereal.

07:34.958 --> 07:38.273
All my teeth are gonna fall out.
And then I'll have to eat oatmeal,

07:38.275 --> 07:42.288
and it'll be sugar-free!
Sugar fre-e-e-e!

07:42.289 --> 07:44.964
I need to reverse this!

07:44.966 --> 07:48.396
I need... a reverse birthday!

07:48.431 --> 07:53.393
The king costume.
Will you help me into my birthday suit?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.124
<i>Yeah, you better run!</i>

07:56.126 --> 08:02.306
Ohh! I'm... too old...
for this.

08:05.970 --> 08:08.917
Lion!

08:08.918 --> 08:13.025
You know ...

08:13.060 --> 08:16.331
- Steven was right. This is fun.
- You don't have to

08:16.366 --> 08:20.924
- keep wearing that stuff.
- It makes me feel... important.

08:20.965 --> 08:25.609
- Steven! What's wrong with him?
- He's okay!

08:25.644 --> 08:30.434
- He's just really, really, really, really old.
- Gems can't die from aging...

08:30.469 --> 08:34.147
- But he's half human.
- Can't we fix him?

08:34.182 --> 08:38.453
My birthday suit might help.

08:38.455 --> 08:41.727
<i>Good as new! Right?</i>

08:41.761 --> 08:47.481
Thanks, guys. But I guess
this suit's all out of birthday magic.

08:47.516 --> 08:50.363
We had a good run, huh?

08:54.578 --> 08:59.115
- More birthdays... now.
- Check it out, b-day boy!

08:59.150 --> 09:03.254
- Heh, I'm a tiny car!
- Beep beep.

09:03.401 --> 09:06.200
Kids... stuff...?

09:07.466 --> 09:12.187
Eh, piñata time!

09:12.222 --> 09:16.181
- It's not working!
- Pearl, get over here!

09:16.216 --> 09:18.841
- I can't!
- For Steven!

09:18.843 --> 09:23.262
Oh, look... I have what, uh ...

09:23.264 --> 09:29.268
what appears to be... a delicious pie!
I sincerely hope that...

09:29.270 --> 09:32.255
nothing happens to...

09:32.256 --> 09:35.931
Oh, Steven!

09:35.966 --> 09:40.362
Are you trying to kill him faster?!

09:40.364 --> 09:43.478
Pearl!

09:52.004 --> 09:55.744
- Garnet!
- Garnet, stop!

09:55.746 --> 09:59.568
I thought violence...
would be the answer.

10:01.879 --> 10:07.100
<i>I think the party approach
was working.</i>

10:07.751 --> 10:10.409
Would you guys just...

10:10.444 --> 10:14.005
please... control yourselves?!

10:15.733 --> 10:18.854
Uh... Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry.

10:18.855 --> 10:22.880
I shouldn't have yelled.
But I can't stand to see

10:22.915 --> 10:25.690
- you freaking out like this!
- Wha...?

10:25.725 --> 10:29.205
- Steven, you're changing!
- Your age is fluctuating!

10:29.240 --> 10:31.971
I think your gem is reacting
to your state of mind!

10:32.006 --> 10:37.135
- Steven, stop feeling old!
- But I wasted your time.

10:37.170 --> 10:42.537
- We all have such little time...
- Steven!

10:42.572 --> 10:46.147
You have to feel like yourself...
sweet and considerate

10:46.182 --> 10:50.895
-  and only occasionally obnoxious.
- Do you really think I'm all those things?

10:50.930 --> 10:54.768
- Yes!
- Why else would you throw us all those parties?

10:54.803 --> 11:00.042
Oh, my gosh.
You're right. I am pretty great.

11:01.258 --> 11:04.883
Oh, Steven! Steven!

11:04.918 --> 11:07.429
We'll work on the rest later.
