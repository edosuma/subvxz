00:09.000 --> 00:13.683
Hell, no, we won't go!

00:13.718 --> 00:18.367
There was a war going on.

00:18.402 --> 00:20.334
He killed Malcolm,

00:20.369 --> 00:22.232
King, the president,

00:22.267 --> 00:23.499
even the president's brother.

00:23.534 --> 00:26.117
Vietnam was being shoved
down our throats.

00:26.152 --> 00:28.701
They were shooting us,
hosing us, lynching us,

00:28.736 --> 00:29.866
and in the movies,

00:29.901 --> 00:30.998
they was making us look

00:31.033 --> 00:33.434
any fucking way they wanted to.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.833
Did I fuck him?

00:35.868 --> 00:38.434
Now, see that's
none of your damn business.

00:38.469 --> 00:40.535
<i>Remember this-</i>

00:40.570 --> 00:42.418
good things...

<i>1970.</i>

01:20.567 --> 01:23.234
<i>I'd just finished
directing Watermelon Man</i>

01:23.269 --> 01:24.468
<i>for Columbia Pictures.</i>

01:24.503 --> 01:25.632
<i>They were setting me up</i>

01:25.667 --> 01:29.334
<i>to become their very first
token nigga-ologist.</i>

01:29.369 --> 01:30.833
<i>Since the movie
hadn't come out yet,</i>

01:30.868 --> 01:35.767
<i>everyone was being extra nice,
calling me Mel, baby.</i>

01:35.802 --> 01:36.767
Mel, baby, great picture.

01:36.802 --> 01:37.801
I loved it.

01:37.836 --> 01:38.766
Very funny.

01:38.801 --> 01:41.265
Hey, when do we get
the next script, huh?

01:41.300 --> 01:44.100
Three picture deal
with fucking Columbia Pictures.

01:44.135 --> 01:45.699
Am I good or am I good?

01:45.734 --> 01:47.734
Well, you're going to start
pitching these sons a bitches

01:47.769 --> 01:49.466
<i>before Watermelon Man comes out,</i>

01:49.501 --> 01:52.300
because if we wait
and it opens badly,

01:52.335 --> 01:53.499
these cocksuckers,

01:53.534 --> 01:55.334
they'll turn on us, you know,
in a second.

01:55.369 --> 01:56.466
<i>My agent, Howie, was right.</i>

01:56.501 --> 01:58.534
<i>I had to come up
with my next film idea</i>

01:58.569 --> 02:00.365
<i>before the money guys got cold.</i>

02:00.400 --> 02:02.000
I mean,
it's got to be something funny

02:02.035 --> 02:03.566
because they want something funny.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.599
<i>Hollywood liked
to show us clowning,</i>

02:05.634 --> 02:07.734
<i>but America wasn't
in a laughing mood...</i>

02:09.501 --> 02:11.501
<i>especially black America.</i>

02:28.667 --> 02:29.634
<i>Times were changing.</i>

02:30.834 --> 02:32.867
<i>The Panthers knew it.</i>

02:32.902 --> 02:34.866
<i>The students knew it.</i>

02:34.901 --> 02:38.434
<i>Hollywood was ignoring it.</i>

02:55.701 --> 02:57.767
You happened to be brilliant
at something funny.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.367
What do you...
Maybe a fried chicken man.

02:59.402 --> 03:00.767
It's because it's not far

03:00.802 --> 03:02.098
<i>from Watermelon Man,</i>

03:02.133 --> 03:03.367
and you could make it funny.

03:03.402 --> 03:05.165
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:05.200 --> 03:06.998
<i>I'd grown up on those images</i>

03:07.033 --> 03:10.801
<i>and nothing Hollywood ever did
reflected who we were.</i>

03:40.267 --> 03:41.667
This is it?

03:43.300 --> 03:44.532
This ain't camping.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.167
We don't have a sleeping bag.

03:46.202 --> 03:48.301
You got the helmet, didn't you?

03:48.336 --> 03:50.400
Shut up and listen for a while.

03:52.601 --> 03:55.834
<i>What was my next movie
going to be?</i>

04:00.601 --> 04:01.933
<i>Some idea
was lurking back there,</i>

04:01.968 --> 04:04.300
<i>just waiting
for the coast to clear.</i>

04:04.335 --> 04:05.451
The military?

04:05.486 --> 04:06.532
Somebody, like,

04:06.567 --> 04:08.367
a guy who's, like,
a cook in the Army.

04:08.402 --> 04:10.267
God knows what happens to him.

04:10.302 --> 04:12.133
<i>There was even a military flick</i>

04:12.168 --> 04:13.751
<i>where Bubba can't walk.</i>

04:13.786 --> 04:15.299
<i>The kindly white doctor</i>

04:15.334 --> 04:16.534
<i>gives him a good,
old-fashioned dose</i>

04:16.569 --> 04:17.565
<i>of racial shock.</i>

04:17.601 --> 04:19.767
<i>You dirty nigger!
Get up and walk!</i>

04:19.802 --> 04:22.234
<i>Get him back on his feet.</i>

04:25.767 --> 04:28.501
<i>All for a good cause.</i>

04:54.767 --> 04:57.067
Melvin!

05:15.734 --> 05:17.332
Street brother,

05:17.367 --> 05:19.267
average hustler turns revolutionary.

05:19.302 --> 05:20.684
Another comedy?

05:20.719 --> 05:22.032
Serious as cancer.

05:22.067 --> 05:24.817
Who's going to want to see that?

05:24.852 --> 05:27.567
Black guys always die
in the end.

05:27.602 --> 05:28.434
Can we go now?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.699
<i>That's it.</i>

05:35.734 --> 05:39.599
<i>I'd make a film
about a real brother,</i>

05:39.634 --> 05:41.801
<i>not some bourgie or clown,
like they always do,</i>

05:41.836 --> 05:44.632
<i>but a real brother,
a street brother,</i>

05:44.667 --> 05:46.133
<i>just getting the man's foot
out his ass.</i>

05:49.100 --> 05:50.500
<i>Given number one-</i>

05:50.535 --> 05:51.866
<i>no cop-outs.</i>

05:51.901 --> 05:53.098
<i>I want a movie</i>

05:53.133 --> 05:54.534
<i>where niggers
can walk out the picture</i>

05:54.569 --> 05:55.933
<i>standing tall</i>

05:55.968 --> 05:58.033
<i>instead of having to avoid
each other's eyes.</i>

05:58.068 --> 05:59.766
<i>Given number two-</i>

05:59.801 --> 06:02.767
<i>entertainment-wise,
it had to be a motherfucker.</i>

06:02.802 --> 06:05.534
<i>If folks get bored, it's over.</i>

06:05.569 --> 06:07.399
<i>Given number three-</i>

06:07.434 --> 06:09.866
<i>show business is business.</i>

06:09.901 --> 06:11.801
<i>The man has
an Achilles pocketbook.</i>

06:11.836 --> 06:13.833
<i>It had to be a moneymaker.</i>

06:13.868 --> 06:16.334
<i>The man ain't going to carry
no messages for you for free,</i>

06:16.369 --> 06:20.467
<i>especially a relevant one.</i>

06:49.400 --> 06:51.265
<i>Given number four-</i>

06:51.300 --> 06:55.133
<i>I wanted this picture
to star the community...</i>

06:55.168 --> 06:57.067
<i>all the community.</i>

06:59.868 --> 07:01.165
<i>All the faces</i>

07:01.200 --> 07:02.200
<i>that Norman Rockwell
never painted.</i>

07:26.334 --> 07:28.584
<i>* You bled my mama... *</i>

07:28.619 --> 07:30.834
I might have had a Leroy.

07:30.869 --> 07:34.065
I might have...

07:34.100 --> 07:37.567
<i>I might have had a Leroy...</i>

07:38.868 --> 07:41.599
<i>My secretary, Priscilla,</i>

07:41.634 --> 07:43.934
<i>turned every entrance
into an audition,</i>

07:43.969 --> 07:45.418
<i>but she was too late.</i>

07:45.453 --> 07:46.833
<i>All I could hear</i>

07:46.868 --> 07:50.834
<i>were the voices in my head
talking to me now.</i>

07:50.869 --> 07:53.334
<i>Take him. Take him.</i>

07:57.300 --> 07:59.701
Howie's on the phone.

08:03.033 --> 08:06.332
Mel, your agent's on the phone.

08:06.367 --> 08:08.650
<i>I have a dream that one day...</i>

08:08.685 --> 08:10.899
<i>that all men are created equal.</i>

08:10.934 --> 08:12.499
<i>We don't see
any American dream.</i>

08:12.534 --> 08:16.033
<i>We've experienced
only the American nightmare.</i>

08:17.667 --> 08:22.234
<i>Wash your car, mister?</i>

08:25.367 --> 08:27.434
<i>How you gonna hibernate
like that old bear?</i>

08:27.469 --> 08:29.334
<i>Baby, baby.</i>

08:31.100 --> 08:33.267
<i>That's why the man's
down on you.</i>

08:33.302 --> 08:35.899
Bam. Bam.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.933
<i>You want to know
what they think of you?</i>

08:37.969 --> 08:39.432
<i>Just turn on your TV.</i>

08:39.467 --> 08:42.965
<i>You're nothing but a bunch
of ignorant clowns.</i>

08:43.000 --> 08:45.583
<i>The policeman isn't there
to create disorder.</i>

08:45.618 --> 08:48.167
<i>The policeman is there
to preserve disorder.</i>

08:51.067 --> 08:53.634
<i>The police aren't here
to protect and serve.</i>

08:53.669 --> 08:57.199
<i>They're here
to patrol and control.</i>

08:57.234 --> 08:58.434
<i>Are you anti-cop,
or anti-white?</i>

08:58.469 --> 08:59.899
<i>No, no, no.</i>

08:59.934 --> 09:02.532
<i>We are anti-oppression.</i>

09:02.567 --> 09:04.834
<i>You can't fight racism
with racism.</i>

09:06.901 --> 09:08.484
<i>To defend the freedom
in Vietnam.</i>

09:08.519 --> 09:10.067
<i>Ask not...</i>

09:11.667 --> 09:13.632
<i>what your country
can do for you.</i>

09:13.667 --> 09:16.033
<i>Ask what you can do
for your country.</i>

09:16.068 --> 09:18.265
<i>Justice is blind!</i>

09:18.300 --> 09:21.998
<i>I'd been expecting him.</i>

09:22.033 --> 09:24.667
<i>I knew he'd show up
sooner or later.</i>

09:24.702 --> 09:26.100
You're out of your fucking mind,

09:26.135 --> 09:27.801
you know that?

09:32.801 --> 09:34.968
You in or out?

09:50.467 --> 09:51.532
<i>Finished.</i>

09:51.567 --> 09:53.200
<i>Only one thing left.</i>

09:53.235 --> 09:54.834
<i>I'd need bread.</i>

09:54.869 --> 09:56.534
<i>Money.</i>

10:13.200 --> 10:14.566
Mel?

10:14.601 --> 10:17.434
After two weeks you finally
decide to pick up.

10:17.469 --> 10:19.133
I've been to the gold mine, man.

10:19.168 --> 10:20.332
I struck the mother lode.

10:20.367 --> 10:22.067
Mel. Mel, don't-
don't mess with me.

10:22.102 --> 10:23.732
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

10:23.767 --> 10:25.901
They're gonna back-burner
the three picture deal, Mel.

10:25.936 --> 10:27.467
Now, yesterday they wanted
to do it.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.801
<i>I'm meeting these executives</i>

10:28.836 --> 10:30.065
<i>in less than an hour.</i>

10:30.100 --> 10:33.367
A brother, a street brother,
turns revolutionary.

10:33.402 --> 10:35.466
Okay, good. So wait.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.334
The hero is him or the brother.

10:37.369 --> 10:38.432
<i>Mel, listen.</i>

10:38.467 --> 10:39.833
He's the wrong nigger
to fuck with.

10:39.868 --> 10:42.634
The cops fuck with him,
and he whoops some ass.

10:42.669 --> 10:43.901
The man comes after him,

10:43.936 --> 10:44.965
<i>full force-</i>

10:45.000 --> 10:46.033
<i>Helicopter,
cars, everything,</i>

10:46.068 --> 10:48.499
and he gets away.

10:48.534 --> 10:51.084
Why are the cops after him
if he's the good guy?

10:51.119 --> 10:53.634
Because they're dirty cops, man.
They're racist.

10:53.669 --> 10:54.767
They're crooked cops.

10:54.802 --> 10:55.732
<i>Listen, Mel.</i>

10:55.767 --> 10:57.332
Here's what you're gonna do.

10:57.367 --> 10:59.400
<i>You're gonna meet me
on the lot in an hour,</i>

10:59.435 --> 11:00.667
<i>and wear a suit, please.</i>

11:00.702 --> 11:01.632
<i>And Mel,</i>

11:01.667 --> 11:03.184
<i>even Cagney
didn't get away</i>

11:03.219 --> 11:04.410
<i>with killing cops,
right-</i>

11:04.445 --> 11:05.601
<i>dirty or otherwise.</i>

11:08.234 --> 11:09.234
Oh.

11:16.334 --> 11:17.334
And we're cut.

11:18.334 --> 11:19.734
All right.
Oh, these bags are heavy.

11:19.769 --> 11:20.884
I'm tired of this shit.

11:20.919 --> 11:21.965
Oh, come on,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.200
he's making money,
and he's funny.

11:23.235 --> 11:24.365
Come on.
Don't be so touchy.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.834
It's a Western.
Everybody loves a Western.

11:25.869 --> 11:27.351
You know what?
Speaking of Westerns-

11:27.386 --> 11:28.834
This idea I got
is kind of like a-

11:28.869 --> 11:29.799
like a ghetto Western.

11:29.834 --> 11:30.834
In fact...
Ghetto western?

11:30.869 --> 11:32.084
the brother even wears, like,

11:32.119 --> 11:33.265
a black kind of cowboy hat...

11:33.300 --> 11:35.300
And dig this, man,
at the end of the movie.

11:35.335 --> 11:36.332
When he gets away,

11:36.367 --> 11:37.567
words come blazing
across the screen.

11:37.602 --> 11:39.300
Badass niggas gonna come back

11:39.335 --> 11:40.432
and collect some dues.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.467
Have you lost your mind?
Are you taking drugs now?

11:42.502 --> 11:44.467
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Melvin, listen to me.

11:44.502 --> 11:45.432
<i>On Watermelon Man,</i>

11:45.467 --> 11:47.250
your white lead
is supposed to wake up

11:47.285 --> 11:48.893
from this nightmare
where he's a black guy

11:48.928 --> 11:50.501
and turns back
into being white again,

11:50.536 --> 11:51.699
and you said, "No, no,

11:51.734 --> 11:52.965
being black is not a nightmare,"

11:53.000 --> 11:54.801
and you didn't shoot
the ending the studio wanted.

11:54.836 --> 11:55.766
Who backed you 100 percent?

11:55.801 --> 11:57.365
So why are you doing this to me?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.033
I can't take this kind
of inflammatory shit.

11:59.068 --> 12:00.132
To a major studio,

12:00.167 --> 12:01.534
<i>nobody legitimate
is gonna touch Baadasssss.</i>

12:01.569 --> 12:02.632
No one!

12:02.667 --> 12:04.567
You know how hard
we worked to get here?

12:04.602 --> 12:06.467
Melvin, just do
the fucking comedy, okay?

12:07.534 --> 12:08.634
All right. They're-
They're coming.

12:08.669 --> 12:09.799
Do you know what this is?

12:09.834 --> 12:10.834
You're terrified
you're gonna fail,

12:10.869 --> 12:11.866
so you're failing yourself.

12:11.901 --> 12:14.868
Nothing to it being black
or blue or green.

12:14.903 --> 12:16.567
You hear me?
It's self-destruction.

12:16.602 --> 12:17.567
Hey. Marty.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.367
Allen. How you doing?

12:20.402 --> 12:21.332
Good to see you.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.834
So, listen, you know...

12:23.869 --> 12:25.068
I was- I was-

12:25.103 --> 12:26.232
Melvin. Wa-

12:26.267 --> 12:29.634
He's in a world of his own.

12:29.669 --> 12:30.734
Melvin.

12:36.701 --> 12:37.666
What is this,

12:37.701 --> 12:39.632
some kind of personal crusade,

12:39.667 --> 12:41.284
or are you really
gonna make a movie?

12:41.319 --> 12:42.901
I'm making
a movie, motherfucker.

12:42.936 --> 12:43.866
Yeah?

12:43.901 --> 12:45.232
First black power film.

12:45.267 --> 12:46.534
Yeah, what about people power, man?

12:46.569 --> 12:48.132
No, you people got the power.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.034
All you gotta do
is get yourself a haircut.

12:50.069 --> 12:51.901
You join the establishment
any time you want.

12:51.936 --> 12:52.901
And you are black forever.

12:52.936 --> 12:53.866
Dig it.

12:53.901 --> 12:55.432
Mm-hmm.
I hear that.

12:55.467 --> 12:58.034
You just gotta remember
the golden rule-

12:58.069 --> 13:00.601
He who has the gold
makes the rules.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.334
Now, if the studio
gives you money,

13:03.369 --> 13:04.334
they're gonna want control.

13:04.369 --> 13:05.332
That's true.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.199
Nothing truly revolutionary

13:07.234 --> 13:09.934
is gonna come
from the studio machine.

13:09.969 --> 13:12.065
Independent money.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.667
That's the answer,
independent financing.

13:13.702 --> 13:15.732
Yes.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.050
That's exactly what
I'm talking about,

13:17.085 --> 13:18.334
a group
of radical young filmmakers

13:18.369 --> 13:19.299
collaborating, man.

13:19.334 --> 13:20.499
It makes this easier for us

13:20.534 --> 13:22.000
to float a loan
from the money guy.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.768
You know what I'm talking about?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.466
Diversify our resources, right?

13:25.501 --> 13:28.100
We get a warehouse,
a working space,

13:28.135 --> 13:29.100
share equipment, right?

13:29.135 --> 13:30.365
A living space...

13:30.400 --> 13:32.367
Bill, that's more of this
hippie commune shit.

13:32.402 --> 13:33.367
That's never gonna fly, man.

13:33.402 --> 13:36.933
Fuck you, man.

13:36.968 --> 13:38.601
It's hurts my feelings
calling me a hippie.

13:38.636 --> 13:41.365
Why you wanna do that?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.300
Look, man, I got film experience.

13:43.335 --> 13:44.499
You gotta let me produce.

13:44.534 --> 13:46.100
You can't even balance
your own checkbook.

13:46.135 --> 13:47.634
I got resources, man,

13:47.669 --> 13:49.098
economic resources.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.434
I got people lined up
ready to invest their money

13:51.469 --> 13:53.199
in something real.

13:53.234 --> 13:55.065
You help me raise the money?

13:55.100 --> 13:57.250
You call yourself
whatever you want.

13:57.285 --> 13:59.400
Producer, produced by Bill Harris.

13:59.435 --> 14:01.567
Executive producer.

14:03.901 --> 14:05.032
Oh, another thing.

14:05.067 --> 14:07.400
I want this motherfucker
to be a living work share.

14:07.435 --> 14:10.098
I want 50 percent of the people
on the crew

14:10.133 --> 14:12.467
to be getting experience,
to be third world folks.

14:12.502 --> 14:14.618
Unions are lily white.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.734
They'll never go for it.

14:16.769 --> 14:17.734
Fuck 'em.

14:19.634 --> 14:21.566
<i>Bill was right.</i>

14:21.601 --> 14:23.199
<i>The unions were lily white.</i>

14:23.234 --> 14:25.132
<i>Even if I could
afford their rates,</i>

14:25.167 --> 14:28.534
<i>they'd never let me have
a 50 percent minority crew.</i>

14:30.567 --> 14:31.567
Whoo, whoo.
Whoa, whoa.

14:31.602 --> 14:32.566
Hey!

14:32.601 --> 14:34.532
You look like you got
a sweet, sweet back.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.367
Won't you come party
with Delicious for a while.

14:36.402 --> 14:37.933
No, no, y'all are too much
for me.

14:37.968 --> 14:39.968
Oh, come on, now.
I can make you say mm-hmm.

14:40.003 --> 14:41.018
I bet you could, girl.

14:41.053 --> 14:42.033
Well, that's a shame.

14:58.501 --> 15:00.034
<i>The answer was so obvious</i>

15:00.069 --> 15:01.532
<i>I didn't see it at first.</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:03.766
<i>The unions don't bother
with smut films.</i>

15:03.801 --> 15:06.899
<i>They consider pornos
beneath their dignity.</i>

15:06.934 --> 15:09.534
<i>I tell everyone I was
making black beaver flick.</i>

15:09.569 --> 15:11.300
<i>Maybe they'd
leave me the hell alone.</i>

15:11.335 --> 15:12.265
<i>One name kept coming up</i>

15:12.300 --> 15:14.801
<i>in the production credits...</i>

15:14.836 --> 15:17.467
<i>Clyde Houston.</i>

15:25.534 --> 15:27.634
Can I get a little
bit more emotion,

15:27.669 --> 15:29.466
Brenda?

15:29.501 --> 15:30.968
You have to fuck me for that.

15:31.003 --> 15:32.501
More of the same then.

15:32.536 --> 15:34.634
That's perfect.

15:38.934 --> 15:40.165
Melvin Van Peebles.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.367
I'm putting together
a feature.

15:41.402 --> 15:42.534
I saw your credit
on "Lily White. "

15:43.801 --> 15:45.934
Oh, yeah, man.
I got your message. I'm in.

15:47.901 --> 15:49.434
Don't you wanna know
what it's about?

15:49.469 --> 15:52.300
Do they wear clothes?

15:52.335 --> 15:53.365
Yeah.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.833
Well, like I said,
I'm in.

15:55.868 --> 15:57.868
One more time
from the top, please.

16:19.634 --> 16:20.684
Hey, Bill.

16:20.719 --> 16:21.726
Go get it!

16:21.761 --> 16:22.699
Hey, Nixon.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.067
Nixon. Hey, baby, look at that.

16:25.102 --> 16:27.167
Nixon loves you, baby.

16:27.202 --> 16:28.117
Howdy.

16:28.152 --> 16:29.033
All right.

16:30.167 --> 16:31.599
Here we go.

16:31.634 --> 16:33.732
So this guy
used to be an actor.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.767
Used to be in all
these black and white westerns.

16:35.802 --> 16:37.367
You probably recognize him.

16:37.402 --> 16:38.701
He's got real money?

16:38.736 --> 16:39.868
Real money, my friend.

16:39.903 --> 16:40.965
He's already financed

16:41.000 --> 16:42.883
a couple of independent
films in Europe,

16:42.918 --> 16:44.767
and he's ready to break big
state side, huh?

16:44.802 --> 16:45.732
Okay.

16:45.767 --> 16:48.267
Ostentatious big white house
on the left.

16:48.302 --> 16:49.365
Go ahead. Go on, man.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.601
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're not coming?

16:50.636 --> 16:51.766
Oh, no, no, no, man.

16:51.801 --> 16:53.801
He just wants to meet
one on one, you know?

16:53.836 --> 16:55.801
Artist to artist,
all right?

16:55.836 --> 16:56.833
Go get it.

16:56.868 --> 16:58.167
Okay. What's this?

16:59.934 --> 17:01.833
Oh, man.

17:01.868 --> 17:03.601
My favorite fucking danishes,
man.

17:03.636 --> 17:04.732
What's this for?

17:04.767 --> 17:06.501
For being your friend,
you crazy motherfucker.

17:06.536 --> 17:08.534
Ow, you are my friend!

17:15.067 --> 17:17.250
Mr. Van Peebles,
howdy, howdy.

17:17.285 --> 17:19.434
What'll it be?
Name your poison.

17:19.469 --> 17:20.398
Beer's cool.

17:20.434 --> 17:21.833
<i>Aside from the tan,</i>

17:21.867 --> 17:24.767
<i>this guy seemed pretty genuine
for Hollywood standards.</i>

17:24.801 --> 17:26.767
My contacts
at the studio said

17:26.801 --> 17:27.732
that you can be

17:27.767 --> 17:30.566
a real stubborn pain
in the ass.

17:30.601 --> 17:32.934
They used to say
the same thing about me.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.267
I like that. It means
you're different.

17:39.033 --> 17:41.365
Different threatens them.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.868
Now tell me about
that movie you wanna make.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.267
This is a movie about
modern-day colonialism,

17:49.302 --> 17:50.732
about a brother...

17:50.767 --> 17:52.634
<i>He was a no bullshit guy.</i>

17:52.669 --> 17:53.699
<i>No lackey.</i>

17:53.734 --> 17:54.934
<i>No chicks hanging
around the pool</i>

17:54.969 --> 17:56.265
<i>for him to impress.</i>

17:56.300 --> 17:57.534
<i>Just straight to the point.</i>

17:59.667 --> 18:01.650
Strong.

18:01.685 --> 18:04.509
Insightful.

18:04.544 --> 18:07.299
Very powerful.

18:07.334 --> 18:08.367
Who's playing the lead?

18:08.402 --> 18:09.968
I don't know yet.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.968
It should be you.

18:16.634 --> 18:17.834
I'm the writer.
I'm the director-

18:17.869 --> 18:18.965
No, you've been
living it.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.767
You have the passion for it,
don't you?

18:20.802 --> 18:22.184
Yeah.

18:22.219 --> 18:23.567
Trust me.

18:25.400 --> 18:30.067
I have the eye. Be honest.

18:30.102 --> 18:31.901
You're beautiful,

18:31.936 --> 18:33.666
sleek, strong...

18:33.701 --> 18:35.767
You're not afraid
to be different.

18:35.802 --> 18:36.998
You're not afraid to be

18:37.033 --> 18:39.834
who you really are,
are you?

18:43.734 --> 18:45.467
How well I know what that is.

18:48.033 --> 18:50.901
How about a little dippety-doo?

18:52.868 --> 18:56.067
Come on, sexy mon.

18:58.534 --> 18:59.965
Oh, Melvin.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.165
Hey, how'd it go, man?

19:01.200 --> 19:03.434
Give me
my motherfucking danishes.

19:05.701 --> 19:07.265
Hollywood's
a close-knit community.

19:07.300 --> 19:11.300
It's easy to make friends,
and it's easy to make enemies.

19:11.335 --> 19:13.467
The friends
you don't normally keep,

19:13.502 --> 19:16.799
but the enemies, you do.

19:16.834 --> 19:18.599
If you wanna be
a part of the stew,

19:18.634 --> 19:20.434
you really don't want
to stir things up,

19:20.469 --> 19:22.234
or you may find yourself
in the fire, baby.

19:22.269 --> 19:23.699
MGM, Paramount-

19:23.734 --> 19:25.534
They're all losing money.
They're all in the toilet.

19:25.569 --> 19:26.734
MGM's selling off its back lot.

19:26.769 --> 19:27.866
It's selling-

19:27.901 --> 19:29.501
It's selling
Dorothy's red shoes,

19:29.536 --> 19:32.265
for God's sake...

19:32.300 --> 19:34.334
and he's making them nervous
with this kind of material.

19:34.369 --> 19:35.766
<i>The Chicago Seven trial</i>

19:35.801 --> 19:37.151
<i>has finally come to an end.</i>

19:37.186 --> 19:38.466
<i>Black Panther Bobby Seale,</i>

19:38.501 --> 19:39.901
<i>one of
the original defendants...</i>

19:49.901 --> 19:50.868
Mom?

19:52.434 --> 19:53.434
Mom, where are the kids?

19:53.469 --> 19:54.732
<i>Oh, Rochester,</i>

19:54.767 --> 19:56.367
<i>see that Mr. Kern
has some coffee, please.</i>

19:56.402 --> 19:57.834
<i>Yassir.</i>

19:57.869 --> 19:59.267
Mom.

20:04.868 --> 20:08.265
Get 'em all.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.000
Always do a good job.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.132
You crumb-crushers
ready?

20:13.167 --> 20:15.400
Get your bathing suits.
Let's hit it.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.499
Hey, Dad.

20:21.534 --> 20:24.767
I'm teaching the boy about work.

20:26.801 --> 20:29.501
Man's gotta know how
to make a living.

20:33.234 --> 20:35.317
You look tired.

20:35.352 --> 20:37.326
Need anything?

20:37.361 --> 20:39.265
No, I'm fine.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.300
What about you, Dad?

20:40.335 --> 20:42.451
Peebles.

20:42.486 --> 20:44.532
Peebles!

20:44.567 --> 20:47.283
Guess I better be going.

20:47.318 --> 20:50.000
You know how your mother is.

20:54.234 --> 20:55.801
Melvin, what happened
to your motorcycle?

20:57.501 --> 20:58.968
I bought a car for today.
Get in.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.367
I want you start
calling me Dad.

21:09.634 --> 21:11.833
Answer me
when I talk to you.

21:11.868 --> 21:14.033
Mom lets us
call her Maria.

21:14.068 --> 21:15.299
It's less confusing

21:15.334 --> 21:16.734
when everyone's calling
off for their mother.

21:16.769 --> 21:18.367
I'm not your mother.
I'm your father.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.332
But while you're here,

21:19.367 --> 21:20.767
you do
what the fuck I say.

21:20.802 --> 21:21.967
Am I clear?

21:22.002 --> 21:23.133
Yes, Dad.

21:24.734 --> 21:25.667
Okay.

21:26.901 --> 21:28.265
All right.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.834
* Doo-dee-doo-dee-dee *

21:31.667 --> 21:33.532
Sing it for me.
Be my piano.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.701
* Doo-dee-doo-dee-dee *

21:35.736 --> 21:36.666
Louder.

21:36.701 --> 21:37.701
* Doo-dee-doo-dee-dee *

21:37.736 --> 21:38.666
Louder.

21:38.701 --> 21:40.884
* You bled my mama *

21:40.919 --> 21:42.826
* Doo-dee-doo-dee-dee *

21:42.861 --> 21:44.897
* You bled my papa *

21:44.932 --> 21:46.899
* Doo-dee-doo-dee-dee *

21:46.934 --> 21:49.234
You won't bleed me!
Again, louder!

22:08.033 --> 22:10.934
Mel, welcome.
How you doing?

22:10.969 --> 22:11.998
Good, how you doing?

22:12.033 --> 22:14.367
Doing great.
This is my wife, Jennifer.

22:14.402 --> 22:15.332
Hi, Jennifer.

22:15.367 --> 22:16.601
That there's Josh and Tracey.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.132
These are my kids,
Mario and Megan.

22:21.167 --> 22:23.167
Oh, good thing you brought along
your bathing suits, kids.

22:23.202 --> 22:24.332
Why don't you take a dip

22:24.367 --> 22:25.968
while your dad and I talk shop,
huh?

22:26.003 --> 22:27.199
Go on.

22:27.234 --> 22:29.133
Jen, go and get Mel
something to eat.

22:29.168 --> 22:30.150
You want a drink?

22:30.185 --> 22:31.098
Sure, water's good.

22:31.133 --> 22:32.167
All right.
Help yourself.

22:32.202 --> 22:33.199
So, um...

22:33.234 --> 22:34.634
I hear great things
from Bill Harris

22:34.669 --> 22:35.599
about your project.

22:35.634 --> 22:36.599
Real radical stuff, huh?

22:36.634 --> 22:37.799
Well, the truth
is always radical

22:37.834 --> 22:40.300
when it's told
by the oppressed, right?

22:40.335 --> 22:42.365
Whatever.
I make movies.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.133
Hey, Dad, come on.
Can we climb the rope?

22:45.168 --> 22:46.634
Well, that's just
something I do

22:46.669 --> 22:49.534
to keep in shape.

22:54.067 --> 22:55.350
Come on, Dad.

22:55.385 --> 22:56.634
You can do it.

23:16.067 --> 23:17.233
That is not easy.

23:17.268 --> 23:18.400
Congratulations.

23:19.968 --> 23:21.133
You try it.

23:21.168 --> 23:22.098
Huh?

23:22.133 --> 23:23.533
No, it took me
almost a year

23:23.568 --> 23:24.934
before I could
get to the top.

23:24.969 --> 23:26.265
You gotta be
in great shape.

23:26.300 --> 23:27.834
You don't wanna
embarrass yourself.

23:27.869 --> 23:28.799
Please?

23:28.834 --> 23:29.799
You can do it.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.033
You know what?
Not today, kids.

23:31.068 --> 23:32.199
Your dad's tired.

23:32.234 --> 23:34.234
Hey, I think we got
some cake in the house.

23:34.269 --> 23:35.351
Who wants cake?

23:35.386 --> 23:36.434
I do. I do. I do.

23:36.469 --> 23:37.535
Let's go.

23:37.570 --> 23:38.601
Come on.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.067
Please?

23:43.834 --> 23:44.968
Dad?

24:13.667 --> 24:15.734
<i>I should have known better</i>

24:15.769 --> 24:17.766
<i>than to make that climb,</i>

24:17.801 --> 24:20.634
<i>considering black folk's
history with ropes.</i>

24:20.669 --> 24:23.467
<i>I gotta be the first nigga
in history</i>

24:23.502 --> 24:25.234
<i>that hung himself.</i>

24:34.734 --> 24:36.684
Man, all right.
You made it.

24:36.719 --> 24:38.376
Hey, you're not so mad,
are you?

24:38.411 --> 24:40.033
All right, man,
who's your friend?

24:40.068 --> 24:41.065
He is in here, man.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.466
He is ready for you, my friend.

24:42.501 --> 24:45.267
Everybody is flying high.
Come on in.

24:47.267 --> 24:48.365
Hey, Moonbeam...

24:48.400 --> 24:50.950
Ginnie, this is Melvin.

24:50.985 --> 24:53.192
Moonbeam is pure love, man.

24:53.227 --> 24:55.365
This is Ginnie. She's from-

24:55.400 --> 24:56.801
Where you from?
Where you from, baby?

24:56.836 --> 24:57.766
Alabama.

24:57.801 --> 24:58.934
Alabama.

24:59.934 --> 25:01.150
Bill, Bill,
Bill, Bill...

25:01.185 --> 25:02.367
Where's
the money guy, man?

25:02.402 --> 25:03.568
He's here, man.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.699
He's for real,

25:04.734 --> 25:06.534
and he's ready to do
some serious business, man.

25:06.569 --> 25:07.666
Well, let's go meet-

25:07.701 --> 25:09.167
Let's go meet this guy,
man. Come on.

25:14.634 --> 25:17.767
This time, the brother gets away
and at the end...

25:17.802 --> 25:19.934
Sweet Sweetback's
Baadasssss Song.

25:23.133 --> 25:24.899
Far out.

25:24.934 --> 25:26.232
Donovan, what
do you think, man?

25:26.267 --> 25:29.100
Well, everybody needs
someone to love, right,

25:29.135 --> 25:30.901
and I got
one question for you,

25:30.936 --> 25:32.165
my brother.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.883
For the
collective conscience

25:33.918 --> 25:35.326
of the universe
be expanded

25:35.361 --> 25:36.699
after people see
this flick,

25:36.734 --> 25:39.332
and I'm not talking
individuals here.

25:39.367 --> 25:42.367
I'm talking about
the whole fucking universe,

25:42.402 --> 25:44.484
moving ahead in time,

25:44.519 --> 25:46.532
not horizontally, man.

25:46.567 --> 25:48.265
Vertically,
you know, a jump.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.334
You know what I mean?
A real jump.

25:50.369 --> 25:52.351
Is that what we got here?

25:52.386 --> 25:54.334
Abso-fucking-lutely, man.

25:54.369 --> 25:55.666
All right.

25:55.701 --> 25:57.667
How do I know
they're not narcs?

25:59.801 --> 26:02.699
They're not narcs.

26:02.734 --> 26:04.484
One minute, gentlemen.
Come here.

26:04.519 --> 26:06.199
How do I know they're real, man?

26:06.234 --> 26:07.834
How do I know they're
fucking real, man?

26:07.869 --> 26:08.799
He's for real.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.734
He wants to be
a producer, man.

26:10.769 --> 26:13.168
It's all good.

26:13.203 --> 26:15.532
Oh... hello.

26:15.567 --> 26:16.532
He wants to be loved,

26:16.567 --> 26:20.501
but he'll settle for attention.

26:20.536 --> 26:21.466
Bill...

26:21.501 --> 26:22.701
this guy's got real money,
right?

26:22.736 --> 26:23.884
It's for real.

26:23.919 --> 26:24.998
Relax, man.

26:25.033 --> 26:27.767
You're the serious one.

26:27.802 --> 26:29.467
Intense.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.967
He's-

26:38.002 --> 26:39.799
Ahh...

26:39.834 --> 26:41.965
He'll do it.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.499
Here's the conditions.

26:43.534 --> 26:45.600
My client
is a silent partner.

26:45.635 --> 26:47.684
His name does
not appear anywhere.

26:47.719 --> 26:49.526
All negotiations will be
with my firm

26:49.561 --> 26:51.334
with all legal fees
added to the budget.

26:51.369 --> 26:53.399
This is the deal...

26:53.434 --> 26:55.499
<i>Bottom-feeders
always do that,</i>

26:55.534 --> 26:57.566
<i>especially
bottom-feeding attorneys,</i>

26:57.601 --> 27:01.033
<i>inserting themselves
and their fees into the deal...</i>

27:01.068 --> 27:02.265
<i>but fuck it, man,</i>

27:02.300 --> 27:06.400
<i>if this was real,
we were a gold movie,</i>

27:06.435 --> 27:07.766
<i>a green light.</i>

27:07.801 --> 27:09.400
Hey, Melvin.
Have a wonderful evening.

27:09.435 --> 27:11.767
What did I say, man?

27:11.802 --> 27:12.834
It's real.

27:19.801 --> 27:21.000
Whoo!

27:22.501 --> 27:26.265
Yeah... whoo!

27:26.300 --> 27:28.850
<i>* You bled my momma *</i>

27:28.885 --> 27:31.843
<i>* You bled my poppa *</i>

27:31.878 --> 27:35.739
* Won't bleed me *

27:35.774 --> 27:38.687
* You bled my momma *

27:38.722 --> 27:41.601
* You bled my poppa... *

27:41.636 --> 27:42.599
Oh, man.

27:42.634 --> 27:44.801
You chewed this motherfucker
to death.

27:44.836 --> 27:46.065
Bill.
Hmm?

27:46.100 --> 27:47.583
You know
what I'm thinking?

27:47.618 --> 27:49.859
When Sweetback's
in the desert.

27:49.894 --> 27:52.100
He hears the voice
of angels.

27:52.135 --> 27:53.365
But he doesn't see them.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.601
No, he just
hears them, man.

27:54.636 --> 27:55.799
Like the ghetto choir.

27:55.834 --> 27:57.100
Like voices of
the disenfranchised.

27:57.135 --> 28:00.367
Oh, yeah, yeah.

28:00.402 --> 28:02.632
Oh, hello.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.100
Good morning.
Upsy-daisy.

28:04.135 --> 28:05.134
Fantastic.

28:05.169 --> 28:06.098
Right.

28:06.133 --> 28:07.699
You know, I like it.
I like it.

28:07.734 --> 28:11.133
It's surreal. You know,
it takes it all

28:11.168 --> 28:13.868
to a whole other dimension,
right?

28:13.903 --> 28:15.601
That's good.
It's operatic.

28:15.636 --> 28:17.300
And then
you superimposition

28:17.335 --> 28:18.998
for when he's running...

28:19.033 --> 28:20.467
through the ghetto,
urban decay.

28:20.502 --> 28:21.432
Right.
Huh?

28:21.467 --> 28:24.434
Right. I see it.
Oh, hi.

28:25.734 --> 28:27.367
Rise and shine.

28:27.402 --> 28:28.534
Morning.

28:28.569 --> 28:29.632
Hey.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.334
This could-
Whoa. Where am I going-

28:31.369 --> 28:34.167
Okay, whoa!

28:35.567 --> 28:36.767
Another thing-
You listening to me?

28:36.802 --> 28:37.998
Mmm?

28:38.033 --> 28:40.817
Check it out. The music
on this motherfucker, right?

28:40.852 --> 28:43.601
It's got to drive. It's got
to be up front, man.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.133
Who is that bitch?

28:50.168 --> 28:51.098
Priscilla...

28:51.133 --> 28:52.400
Don't Priscilla me. Bill?

28:53.734 --> 28:55.484
Wait, and you got
a dog too,

28:55.519 --> 28:57.176
you nasty, sick motherfucker.

28:57.211 --> 28:58.799
What the fuck you looking at?

28:58.834 --> 29:02.334
I don't believe
this shit, Melvin.

29:02.369 --> 29:03.965
What about Melvin Jr.?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.467
What about our baby, Melvin?
How could you-

29:07.467 --> 29:08.817
You know what?

29:08.852 --> 29:10.132
I want a divorce

29:10.167 --> 29:11.267
because
you're killing me.

29:11.302 --> 29:13.001
You're killing me.

29:13.036 --> 29:14.701
It's over. Over!

29:26.767 --> 29:28.866
You married?

29:28.901 --> 29:31.367
Oh, no, no, no, no, man.
That's his secretary.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.000
See, she does
this whole audition thing.

29:47.033 --> 29:48.417
Aw, yeah.

29:48.452 --> 29:49.766
Let's cut.

29:49.801 --> 29:53.299
The gaffer needs
another shorty.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.200
Anybody have
another towel, please?

29:57.167 --> 30:00.000
<i>Clyde introduced me
to his cameraman, Bob Maxwell.</i>

30:00.035 --> 30:01.432
Bob Maxwell...

30:01.467 --> 30:02.998
<i>His wife, Nora, did makeup.</i>

30:03.033 --> 30:05.033
<i>There's a saying
in the business-</i>

30:05.068 --> 30:07.033
<i>If you can make an ass
look good,</i>

30:07.068 --> 30:09.332
<i>then faces were a snap.</i>

30:09.367 --> 30:11.467
It was like there was
a whole non-union movie industry

30:11.502 --> 30:13.998
in existence right then,

30:14.033 --> 30:16.383
and I knew every one
of them motherfuckers.

30:16.418 --> 30:18.734
Imagine the kind of opportunity
that he's lost,

30:18.769 --> 30:20.268
and he had such a chance to be

30:20.303 --> 30:21.732
such a credit to his people.

30:21.767 --> 30:23.334
How many Negro directors
were there altogether?

30:23.369 --> 30:24.767
Gordon Parks,
there's Ossie Davis...

30:24.802 --> 30:26.701
and Melvin.

30:30.834 --> 30:33.134
Mel, we don't have
a permit for any of this

30:33.169 --> 30:35.434
so we got to shoot it
and get up out of here.

30:35.469 --> 30:36.866
Ahh, we gonna steal this shit.

30:36.901 --> 30:38.634
Priscilla, don't write
the location down

30:38.669 --> 30:39.768
until we all agree on it,

30:39.803 --> 30:41.085
and those pads ain't cheap.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.332
Use a pencil next time.

30:42.367 --> 30:43.866
Hey, girl, put some clothes on.

30:43.901 --> 30:46.334
This ain't soul train.
Come on, now.

30:52.534 --> 30:53.799
Ew!

30:53.834 --> 30:56.734
Bill, get this mangy mutt
off of me, please.

30:56.769 --> 30:59.098
Oh, come on, Nixon.

30:59.133 --> 31:00.167
He just
can't resist you.

31:01.901 --> 31:05.467
You look like
a lemon Popsicle, girl.

31:05.502 --> 31:06.432
All through here.

31:06.467 --> 31:09.232
Oh, this is great shit.

31:09.267 --> 31:11.065
And I can sing, dance,
model, and act too,

31:11.100 --> 31:13.067
so tell that controlling
Leo motherfucker over there

31:13.102 --> 31:14.467
to put me in his damn movie.

31:14.502 --> 31:15.467
Hey, Bill.

31:17.567 --> 31:18.766
Jump over the water

31:18.801 --> 31:19.734
and run down here,
man.

31:22.601 --> 31:23.965
It's too fucking steep.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.400
Hey, man. This is art, baby.

31:27.067 --> 31:28.917
You can do it.

31:28.952 --> 31:30.767
Okay. Hold this.

31:34.934 --> 31:35.899
Whoa!

31:35.934 --> 31:37.200
Come on, feet!

31:37.235 --> 31:38.432
Cruise with me!

31:38.467 --> 31:39.984
<i>Come on, Max.</i>

31:40.019 --> 31:41.493
<i>Come on, run.</i>

31:41.528 --> 31:42.968
Come on, Bill.

31:43.003 --> 31:43.933
Whoa!

31:43.968 --> 31:45.799
Oh, shit.
Oh, sh... it.

31:45.834 --> 31:48.100
You know we're
gonna need a stunt man

31:48.135 --> 31:49.100
when we shoot this.

31:49.135 --> 31:51.466
Oh, yeah.

31:51.501 --> 31:53.484
Sweetback
is still alive!

31:53.519 --> 31:55.432
Priscilla,
make a note

31:55.467 --> 31:57.968
I want some dogs at the end
to chase the brothers.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.098
Three dogs, bloodhounds.

31:59.133 --> 32:00.534
We'll get some modern
runaway slave imagery

32:00.569 --> 32:01.599
with these dogs, man.

32:01.634 --> 32:03.434
And I can save us
some time and money

32:03.469 --> 32:04.434
if we shoot this hand-held.

32:04.469 --> 32:05.899
A little edge.

32:05.934 --> 32:07.934
Edge? Shit, this motherfucker
is gonna be nothing but edge.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.334
Ghetto realism like folks
ain't never seen.

32:09.369 --> 32:10.299
Right on, baby.

32:10.334 --> 32:12.701
Don't you know
what I'm saying?

32:12.736 --> 32:13.866
I mean,
look at this, man.

32:13.901 --> 32:16.517
This is beautiful.
Look at that.

32:16.552 --> 32:19.133
Back the fuck up...

32:19.168 --> 32:21.499
bitch.

32:21.534 --> 32:23.367
Pigs ain't got
nothing on me.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.334
Okay, again.
Contain the hostility more.

32:27.369 --> 32:29.599
B- b...

32:29.634 --> 32:32.400
Back the fuck up,
b- bitch.

32:33.968 --> 32:36.701
Pigs ain't got
nothing on me.

32:36.736 --> 32:37.567
Thank you, brother.

32:44.267 --> 32:45.834
Yeah, nigga.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.133
Well, he didn't exactly
take direction, now, did he?

32:52.168 --> 32:53.098
He's not the lead.

32:53.133 --> 32:54.732
I mean,
he's not even SAG.

32:54.767 --> 32:57.067
The guy can't talk.
Doesn't that bother anybody?

32:57.102 --> 32:59.933
I like his fucked-up speech.
It's real.

32:59.968 --> 33:01.532
Make a note. Let's put him
somewhere, Priscilla.

33:01.567 --> 33:04.601
Shit, I'm better than half
these motherfuckers anyway.

33:08.234 --> 33:09.100
Next.

33:13.501 --> 33:15.000
All right, brother.
Sit down right there.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.434
Action.

33:22.834 --> 33:23.965
<i>Finding the lead</i>

33:24.000 --> 33:26.117
<i>was turning out to be
problematic.</i>

33:26.152 --> 33:28.234
<i>Sweetback would only have
six lines</i>

33:28.269 --> 33:30.199
<i>in the whole movie.</i>

33:30.234 --> 33:34.633
<i>Those with the grit didn't have
the technique,</i>

33:34.668 --> 33:39.033
<i>and those with the technique
wanted more lines.</i>

33:39.068 --> 33:40.501
Hey, crumb-crusher.

33:40.536 --> 33:41.466
Huh?

33:41.501 --> 33:42.400
Come here.

33:44.167 --> 33:46.601
Why don't you have lunch
with your old man, huh?

33:46.636 --> 33:48.551
You're going to go see
Howie, remember?

33:48.586 --> 33:50.576
<i>Howie was probably hoping</i>

33:50.611 --> 33:52.532
<i>I'd come to my senses.</i>

33:52.567 --> 33:56.899
<i>His wife, Roz, was taking Mario
for the day.</i>

33:56.934 --> 33:59.968
<i>We were gonna be shooting
in some rough-ass places,</i>

34:00.003 --> 34:01.734
<i>so we'd need
some ghetto muscle.</i>

34:18.367 --> 34:19.934
Hello?

34:23.234 --> 34:25.634
Hey!

34:40.701 --> 34:43.266
<i>Talking about education,
protesting, organizing,</i>

34:43.302 --> 34:45.833
<i>and getting the
man's foot out of they ass.</i>

34:45.869 --> 34:46.868
<i>See, now,
you're a problem.</i>

34:46.902 --> 34:47.833
Hello?

34:47.868 --> 34:48.984
<i>You mean
you're anti-white?</i>

34:49.018 --> 34:50.065
<i>We're anti-oppression.</i>

34:50.100 --> 34:51.500
<i>You can't fight racism
with racism.</i>

34:51.534 --> 34:52.917
<i>What, niggas
talking revolution</i>

34:52.952 --> 34:54.300
<i>is crossing
the color line?</i>

34:54.335 --> 34:56.467
<i>Hell, no.</i>

34:57.501 --> 35:00.032
<i>No more Mr. Nice Guy.</i>

35:00.067 --> 35:01.466
<i>The man takes off
the old sheets</i>

35:01.501 --> 35:03.234
<i>and picks up the badge
and the gun</i>

35:03.269 --> 35:05.051
<i>to protect and serve.</i>

35:05.086 --> 35:06.834
<i>To patrol and control.</i>

35:06.869 --> 35:09.132
Hello.

35:09.167 --> 35:10.799
<i>Will justice prevail</i>

35:10.834 --> 35:12.434
<i>or will it just
be us in jail?</i>

35:12.469 --> 35:13.532
<i>Shit.</i>

35:13.567 --> 35:14.684
<i>That's right, brother.</i>

35:14.719 --> 35:15.766
<i>From shackles to cuffs,</i>

35:15.801 --> 35:17.400
<i>he still got his foot
in yo' ass.</i>

35:17.435 --> 35:20.701
<i>One size fits all, nigga.</i>

35:20.736 --> 35:23.933
<i>One size fits all...</i>

35:23.968 --> 35:26.701
<i>One size fits all, nigga.</i>

35:30.567 --> 35:33.334
T.J., down, boy.

35:38.901 --> 35:40.450
T.J.'s the alpha male.

35:40.485 --> 35:42.000
They do what he do.

35:45.234 --> 35:47.868
Last motherfucker
broke in here,

35:47.903 --> 35:50.133
they tore his arm off.

35:51.234 --> 35:52.834
That pipe wouldn't have helped.

35:57.534 --> 35:58.901
You eat pig?

35:58.936 --> 36:00.098
Yeah.

36:00.133 --> 36:01.466
Pig's bad for you.

36:01.501 --> 36:04.634
This here's smoked turkey.

36:04.669 --> 36:07.767
Taste better than pig.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.567
Howard, you spent six months
in film school,

36:20.602 --> 36:21.998
so are you going to be

36:22.033 --> 36:23.199
in the smoked meat
business

36:23.234 --> 36:25.767
or are you going to be
in the movie business?

36:25.802 --> 36:28.399
<i>Besides security,</i>

36:28.434 --> 36:31.267
<i>T could double as the boom man
for the sound guy.</i>

36:31.302 --> 36:32.532
<i>Only drawback,</i>

36:32.567 --> 36:34.067
<i>he didn't know shit
about recording sound.</i>

36:34.102 --> 36:36.234
Check it out.

36:36.269 --> 36:37.133
What?

36:43.434 --> 36:44.632
Honey.

36:44.667 --> 36:45.967
Melvin, it's Mario
on the phone.

36:46.002 --> 36:47.232
He's going to be
a little late.

36:47.267 --> 36:49.400
<i>Tell him
to get his ass on home.</i>

36:49.435 --> 36:52.098
Okay. Hey.

36:52.133 --> 36:53.534
<i>Your dad is busy
right now, honey.</i>

36:53.569 --> 36:54.534
<i>You better come on home.</i>

36:55.534 --> 36:56.766
<i>All right.</i>

36:56.801 --> 36:58.601
First thing you need to know
about movie making-

36:58.636 --> 37:00.501
when the director
says listen up,

37:00.536 --> 37:01.667
you listen the fuck up,

37:01.702 --> 37:02.632
okay?

37:02.667 --> 37:03.868
We start shooting
in three days.

37:03.903 --> 37:04.833
This is a family affair.

37:04.868 --> 37:06.567
This is Bob
and his lovely wife, Nora.

37:06.602 --> 37:07.632
Nora does makeup.

37:07.667 --> 37:08.750
Bob is our
cinematographer.

37:08.785 --> 37:10.359
We'll have
two cameras working,

37:10.394 --> 37:12.147
so we also have,
from New York,

37:12.182 --> 37:13.901
Black Latino
Filmmaker's Coalition,

37:13.936 --> 37:15.165
José Garcia.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.934
<i>Que vivo
Puerto Rico libre.</i>

37:17.969 --> 37:19.051
Exactly.

37:19.086 --> 37:20.098
All right.

37:20.133 --> 37:21.733
On script,
we got Randy over here,

37:21.768 --> 37:23.334
and our genius of sound
is Tommy,

37:23.369 --> 37:24.866
backed up by Big T,

37:24.901 --> 37:26.267
who'll also be
heading up security.

37:26.302 --> 37:27.267
Oh, no, no, man.

37:27.302 --> 37:28.299
Hey, hey.

37:28.334 --> 37:30.299
Why do I got to answer
to a white man

37:30.334 --> 37:32.334
on a movie about a brother
finally breaking the chains,

37:32.369 --> 37:33.566
you dig?

37:33.601 --> 37:35.400
We been answering to whitey
for 400 years, blood.

37:35.435 --> 37:36.365
Well, T, now, hold up.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.601
Tommy here
is risking his career

37:37.636 --> 37:38.599
to be here.

37:38.634 --> 37:40.033
He's one of the few
motherfuckers here

37:40.068 --> 37:41.451
who really knows
what he's doing,

37:41.486 --> 37:42.799
so why don't you
do yourself a favor?

37:42.834 --> 37:44.267
You'll learn something.
Listen to this man.

37:44.302 --> 37:45.232
When your big ass

37:45.267 --> 37:46.300
has been listening
to whitey

37:46.335 --> 37:47.332
for 400 years,

37:47.367 --> 37:48.998
another month won't hurt.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.934
All right,
last but not least,

37:50.969 --> 37:51.899
right here,

37:51.934 --> 37:52.998
my foxy production
secretary

37:53.033 --> 37:55.317
and star of the first
day of shooting

37:55.352 --> 37:57.601
<i>of Sweet Sweetback's
Baadasssss Song,</i>

37:57.636 --> 37:58.734
Priscilla.

38:00.133 --> 38:01.100
That's right.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.801
Listen up. The speech.
Come here, baby.

38:04.701 --> 38:06.165
Look around you.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.683
No crew has ever
looked like this.

38:07.718 --> 38:09.132
We're not supposed
to get along,

38:09.167 --> 38:11.367
let alone be able
to make a movie together, okay?

38:11.402 --> 38:14.001
Once we get started,
there's no quitting,

38:14.036 --> 38:16.601
so anybody want out,
hit the door now.

38:19.234 --> 38:20.399
I'm sorry.

38:20.434 --> 38:21.801
It's all right.
Anybody else?

38:24.167 --> 38:25.532
Ah, Mr. Harris.

38:25.567 --> 38:26.767
We'll have
none of this WPT,

38:26.802 --> 38:27.965
Mr. Harris.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.232
What's WPT?

38:29.267 --> 38:30.634
White People Time, T.

38:31.801 --> 38:32.968
We have to talk.

38:33.003 --> 38:33.998
All right.

38:34.033 --> 38:35.634
Let's do it. Let's make a movie.

38:35.669 --> 38:37.267
Yeah!

38:39.467 --> 38:40.833
Hey, Melvin.

38:40.868 --> 38:42.165
The script guy,

38:42.200 --> 38:44.000
he says you only got
a 65-minute movie here.

38:45.667 --> 38:47.365
Listen,
I know what I got.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.133
Let him keep track
of the shots, okay?

38:49.168 --> 38:51.332
I got it in my head.
Cool?

38:51.367 --> 38:52.567
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry.

38:52.602 --> 38:54.068
Hey, Melvin.
It's Clyde.

38:54.103 --> 38:55.534
He's got to talk to you.

38:55.569 --> 38:56.732
We got to talk now.

38:56.767 --> 38:58.701
All right, well, find out
what he wants, okay?

38:58.736 --> 39:00.868
Hey, Clyde.

39:02.868 --> 39:04.384
He got arrested.

39:04.419 --> 39:05.976
Who?
Donovan.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.499
Our financing man.

39:07.534 --> 39:08.734
Motherfucker. What for?

39:11.501 --> 39:12.667
What about that attorney?

39:12.702 --> 39:13.732
We had a deal.

39:13.767 --> 39:15.365
Yeah, let's just say that, uh...

39:15.400 --> 39:17.801
the financing for this film
has been put on the back burner

39:17.836 --> 39:19.899
for the foreseeable
future,

39:19.934 --> 39:22.434
like the next
five to 10 years, man.

39:23.734 --> 39:26.033
You got to go in there.

39:26.068 --> 39:28.801
You got to cancel.

39:33.868 --> 39:36.033
Fuck it.
I'll use my own bread.

39:36.068 --> 39:37.265
Oh, no, no, no, man.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.701
Nobody uses their own money
to finance a movie, man.

39:39.736 --> 39:41.201
What if the movie's a bomb

39:41.236 --> 39:42.632
or you spend
your money on it

39:42.667 --> 39:43.868
and you can't get
a distributor-?

39:43.903 --> 39:45.651
I can raise $72,450.

39:45.686 --> 39:47.365
Make that $72,000-

39:47.400 --> 39:48.632
I haven't paid
next month's rent-

39:48.667 --> 39:50.267
but that's enough
to get the train rolling.

39:50.302 --> 39:51.499
I get the train rolling,

39:51.534 --> 39:53.334
investors are going to see
we got something good

39:53.369 --> 39:54.734
and they're going
to jump on board.

39:54.769 --> 39:56.165
And what if they don't, man?

39:56.200 --> 39:58.200
That $72,000's not going to get
you through pre-production-

39:58.235 --> 40:00.100
Bill, do you have money for me?

40:02.167 --> 40:03.834
Melvin, we got a problem.

40:07.567 --> 40:08.532
Yeah?

40:08.567 --> 40:09.766
<i>They're asking</i>

40:09.801 --> 40:11.965
<i>for one week's payroll
up front.</i>

40:12.000 --> 40:13.934
Well, I ain't got
that kind of bread, Clyde.

40:16.267 --> 40:17.833
Fuck it.

40:17.868 --> 40:19.400
<i>SAG is...</i>

40:23.367 --> 40:25.167
We can't use any SAG actors.

40:25.202 --> 40:26.732
What?

40:26.767 --> 40:28.199
Shit, we shoot
in three days.

40:28.234 --> 40:31.150
We're going to have
to postpone, right?

40:31.185 --> 40:34.067
We start shooting May 11
as planned.

40:34.102 --> 40:38.000
Everybody got that?

40:38.035 --> 40:39.666
Yeah.
Right.

40:39.701 --> 40:41.167
All right, get back to work.

40:41.202 --> 40:42.334
We'll recast.

40:42.369 --> 40:43.334
Shit.

40:44.667 --> 40:45.933
Who's going to play
Sweetback?

40:45.968 --> 40:48.834
<i>I was starting to believe
my own bullshit.</i>

40:48.869 --> 40:51.534
<i>Chomping on an unlit cigar...</i>

40:54.033 --> 40:55.432
Hey, Mel.

40:55.467 --> 40:56.634
Come on.

40:58.567 --> 41:00.033
Ta-da.

41:01.133 --> 41:02.332
Howie says hello.

41:02.367 --> 41:04.934
You've got
a great kid here.

41:15.367 --> 41:16.532
What you got there?

41:16.567 --> 41:17.801
Miss Kaufman bought it for me.

41:17.836 --> 41:18.833
I didn't ask for it.

41:18.868 --> 41:20.701
Tomorrow you bring it back.

41:20.736 --> 41:22.666
Bring it back?

41:22.701 --> 41:24.766
You losing your hearing?

41:24.801 --> 41:27.400
When I want
a favor from Howie,

41:27.435 --> 41:28.998
I'll call it in, okay?

41:29.033 --> 41:31.267
You don't let people use you
to get to me.

41:31.302 --> 41:33.267
What people?

41:35.501 --> 41:36.701
Get in the house.

41:38.901 --> 41:42.400
<i>Melvin had not submitted
the proper paperwork</i>

41:42.435 --> 41:44.365
to the Screen Actors Guild.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.901
I think when you've heard Mel
all of your life,

41:46.936 --> 41:48.899
you just don't listen anymore.

41:48.934 --> 41:50.934
Who had to go down there
and sort everything out?

41:50.969 --> 41:52.032
Mr. Clyde.

41:52.067 --> 41:54.767
Of course,
you don't hear about that.

41:54.802 --> 41:55.968
We were following him, you know?

41:56.003 --> 41:57.165
He was our leader,

41:57.200 --> 42:00.032
so if he was crazy,
we were fucking lunatics.

42:00.067 --> 42:02.200
I just looked around
and I knew we were in trouble.

42:05.267 --> 42:06.332
In L.A.,

42:06.367 --> 42:08.584
you can't even see
the stars at night.

42:08.619 --> 42:10.766
It's not the city lights.
It's the smog.

42:10.801 --> 42:12.601
Shut the fuck up, man.
I'm trying to calculate.

42:12.636 --> 42:14.133
What're you trying
to calculate?

42:14.168 --> 42:15.098
You ain't got shit.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.333
You ain't even got
your lead.

42:16.368 --> 42:17.534
No, no,
I'll play the lead.

42:17.569 --> 42:18.499
I'll play Sweetback.

42:18.534 --> 42:19.734
Fuck it.
I know the lines.

42:19.769 --> 42:20.835
I'm not union, right?

42:20.870 --> 42:21.866
I'm not taking a salary.

42:21.901 --> 42:24.734
Fool, ain't nobody
investing in this shit.

42:24.769 --> 42:27.567
I'll cut more days
out of the schedule.

42:27.602 --> 42:28.666
Hey, look,

42:28.701 --> 42:30.501
it'll take 40 days
to make a studio movie.

42:30.536 --> 42:32.232
You settle for 27.

42:32.267 --> 42:33.901
Then you cut it down to 24,
minimum.

42:33.936 --> 42:34.934
Now what?

42:37.234 --> 42:38.432
20.

42:38.467 --> 42:40.817
20 with some ragtag crew
that don't know shit?

42:40.852 --> 42:43.167
Man, you're about to lose
every fucking thing.

42:43.202 --> 42:45.001
Kids' college funds, all of it.

42:45.036 --> 42:46.801
Just get the fuck off my roof.

42:46.836 --> 42:48.998
Look around you, man.

42:49.033 --> 42:51.100
Every fucking sign is saying,
"Don't do this. "

42:51.135 --> 42:53.051
You're about to be
a Hollywood joke.

42:53.086 --> 42:54.968
Go back to the studio.
Do a comedy.

42:55.003 --> 42:56.199
Do whatever.

42:56.234 --> 42:57.467
Do it with their money.

42:57.502 --> 42:58.632
Make a real movie.

42:58.667 --> 43:00.167
Get the fuck off my roof!

43:03.334 --> 43:05.365
Get the fuck off my roof.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.434
Get the fuck off my roof,
you hear me?

43:08.469 --> 43:11.434
Melvin, who are you
talking to?

43:11.469 --> 43:12.699
Running lines.

43:12.734 --> 43:15.534
Been a long fucking time
since I acted.

43:17.267 --> 43:18.532
Um, I'm sorry to bother you,

43:18.567 --> 43:20.367
but I need to talk to you
about something-

43:20.402 --> 43:21.634
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on, now.

43:21.669 --> 43:23.001
Is this something negative?

43:23.036 --> 43:24.299
Because if it's negative,

43:24.334 --> 43:25.933
I can't even deal with it
right now.

43:25.968 --> 43:29.000
I'm a broke, pissed-off nigga
from Chicago, Priscilla,

43:29.035 --> 43:31.501
and I'm down
to my last cigar, okay?

43:31.536 --> 43:32.701
Don't leave.

43:32.736 --> 43:36.100
Chill.

43:38.367 --> 43:39.732
About...

43:39.767 --> 43:42.998
About tomorrow...

43:43.033 --> 43:45.200
I can't be in the movie.

43:45.235 --> 43:46.666
What?

43:46.701 --> 43:47.784
My boyfriend doesn't...

43:47.819 --> 43:48.868
think I
should do it.

43:48.903 --> 43:50.098
Hold up. Hold up.

43:50.133 --> 43:51.734
I thought you discussed this
with the boyfriend.

43:51.769 --> 43:52.866
I did,

43:52.901 --> 43:55.666
but not about all the
sexy stuff exactly.

43:55.701 --> 43:57.934
Well, we're making a sexy
fucking movie, right?

43:57.969 --> 43:59.133
Now, I've been
straight about that

43:59.168 --> 44:00.133
from the get-go.

44:00.168 --> 44:02.284
I know.

44:02.319 --> 44:04.365
I'm sorry.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.534
Tomorrow's
our first day of shooting.

44:06.569 --> 44:08.132
With all the other shit

44:08.167 --> 44:09.968
I got coming down on my head
right now,

44:10.003 --> 44:11.332
you're fucking sorry?

44:11.367 --> 44:13.734
I'll leave production
if you want me to.

44:13.769 --> 44:15.151
Leave production?

44:15.186 --> 44:16.499
Are you crazy?

44:16.534 --> 44:17.534
That's your
final decision?

44:17.569 --> 44:18.499
You can't? Okay.

44:18.534 --> 44:20.134
You know what you
fucking need to do?

44:20.169 --> 44:21.699
You need to get off
my fucking roof

44:21.734 --> 44:23.334
before I throw you
off this motherfucker,

44:23.369 --> 44:25.065
all right?

44:25.100 --> 44:27.033
Get the fuck
out of here!

44:28.834 --> 44:30.466
I'm trying to do something,

44:30.501 --> 44:32.067
and sorry motherfuckers
come along

44:32.102 --> 44:34.767
and sorry your ass to death.

44:42.400 --> 44:43.998
Hello?

44:44.033 --> 44:46.000
Hey, Ginnie, it's Mel.

44:46.035 --> 44:47.468
Who?

44:47.503 --> 44:48.866
Melvin.

44:48.901 --> 44:50.600
<i>Bill's friend.</i>

44:50.635 --> 44:52.265
Oh, yeah.

44:52.300 --> 44:54.567
What do you want?

44:54.602 --> 44:56.799
<i>How about a date?</i>

44:56.834 --> 44:59.050
So you're asking me out?

44:59.085 --> 45:01.267
<i>Yeah, why the fuck not?</i>

45:01.302 --> 45:02.534
Hmm.

45:02.569 --> 45:03.735
Why not?

45:03.770 --> 45:04.866
<i>Great.</i>

45:04.901 --> 45:06.899
It's going to be special,
though.

45:06.934 --> 45:09.434
<i>I want you to meet me
at 52730 Alameda</i>

45:09.469 --> 45:10.601
<i>tomorrow morning,</i>

45:10.636 --> 45:11.899
7:00 a. m.

45:11.934 --> 45:13.701
A.m.?
Man, shit, you're tripping.

45:13.736 --> 45:14.699
<i>Wait, wait, wait,</i>

45:14.734 --> 45:16.098
now, this is
going to be special.

45:16.133 --> 45:17.934
I told you,
you're never going to forget it,

45:17.969 --> 45:19.568
and don't go getting shy
on me, girl.

45:19.603 --> 45:21.132
Going to be
a couple of people watching.

45:21.167 --> 45:24.968
Now, see, now, I knew you was
a real kinky motherfucker...

45:25.003 --> 45:26.000
So, are we on?

45:29.133 --> 45:30.317
Yeah, we're on.

45:30.352 --> 45:31.466
<i>All right.</i>

45:31.501 --> 45:33.467
Tomorrow morning. Don't be late.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.032
Clyde, Clyde,
come here.

45:38.067 --> 45:40.300
Melvin going to use
his own dad for this scene?

45:40.335 --> 45:41.666
Yeah, well, we ain't got
enough actors,

45:41.701 --> 45:43.734
and Melvin's dad'll
do it for free, you dig?

45:43.769 --> 45:44.866
But that's Melvin.

45:44.901 --> 45:48.133
He told me to get a dildo.
What's a dildo?

45:48.168 --> 45:50.000
Thomas. Thomas.

45:52.200 --> 45:53.866
Why are you doing
this movie, man?

45:53.901 --> 45:58.367
You want to see how
the other half lives, huh?

45:58.402 --> 45:59.601
Hey, look,
there's your fairy godmother.

46:00.601 --> 46:01.566
Melvin, Melvin,

46:01.601 --> 46:02.717
we got to start
shooting, man,

46:02.752 --> 46:03.799
before the husband
comes home

46:03.834 --> 46:05.434
and kicks us the hell
out of here.

46:05.469 --> 46:06.434
Where's Ginnie, man?

46:06.469 --> 46:07.599
Come on.

46:07.634 --> 46:09.434
<i>I was shooting
our sexiest scene up first</i>

46:09.469 --> 46:11.032
<i>so if the union showed,</i>

46:11.067 --> 46:13.133
<i>they'd be convinced
we were doing a black porno.</i>

46:13.168 --> 46:14.365
<i>The problem was,</i>

46:14.400 --> 46:15.901
<i>my date, Ginnie,
got the same impression.</i>

46:15.936 --> 46:16.866
Oh, fuck you, nigger!

46:16.901 --> 46:18.265
I don't do
this kind of shit!

46:18.300 --> 46:19.866
No, no, listen,
I want you to be-

46:19.901 --> 46:22.100
Bill Harris, get your
sorry motherfucking ass

46:22.135 --> 46:23.117
over here.

46:23.152 --> 46:24.065
Sister-

46:24.100 --> 46:25.534
Look, no, no.
Your sorry-ass friend

46:25.569 --> 46:26.933
wants me to be
in his fucking porno.

46:26.968 --> 46:29.000
Did you know about this?
Give me my goddamn hat.

46:29.035 --> 46:29.998
Okay, okay.

46:30.033 --> 46:31.434
It's not a porno, Ginnie,
I swear.

46:31.469 --> 46:32.799
Okay, here we go.

46:32.834 --> 46:34.767
It's not a porno.
It's a social statement.

46:34.802 --> 46:35.732
Tell her, Mel.

46:35.767 --> 46:36.833
A social statement?

46:36.868 --> 46:38.267
I'll should whoop
both your fucking asses.

46:38.302 --> 46:39.265
I'm out of here.

46:39.300 --> 46:40.350
No, no, no, wait.
Sister...

46:40.385 --> 46:41.493
Listen, listen,
listen, listen.

46:41.528 --> 46:42.601
We have been
marginalized sexually

46:42.636 --> 46:43.666
for years.

46:43.701 --> 46:44.900
We've been Aunt Jemima,
Uncle Ben.

46:44.935 --> 46:46.100
We've never had
a Marilyn Monroe,

46:46.135 --> 46:47.365
never had
our own Mae West.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.483
This thing is going to be
breaking all the taboos.

46:49.518 --> 46:51.759
It's about getting
the man's foot out yo' ass.

46:51.794 --> 46:54.000
Exactly. This could be
totally revolutionary.

46:54.035 --> 46:55.901
<i>Ginnie was at least
listening now.</i>

46:55.936 --> 46:57.232
<i>I rapped on</i>

46:57.267 --> 46:59.165
<i>about this being
the opportunity of a lifetime</i>

46:59.200 --> 47:01.501
<i>for her to be the first
soul sister sex goddess.</i>

47:01.536 --> 47:03.532
<i>That was the clincher.</i>

47:03.567 --> 47:09.167
Revolutionary or not,
I still need to get paid.

47:09.202 --> 47:10.501
<i>Plus, the couple
of emergency Benjamins</i>

47:10.536 --> 47:11.635
<i>I laid on her</i>

47:11.670 --> 47:12.699
<i>didn't hurt.</i>

47:12.734 --> 47:13.734
Don't fuck with me.

47:13.769 --> 47:14.699
We're on the camera.

47:14.734 --> 47:15.834
Okay, let's
get her dressed.

47:15.869 --> 47:16.984
I want to shoot
right now.

47:17.019 --> 47:18.065
Mel, let me handle this.

47:18.100 --> 47:19.701
It's going to be out of sight,
baby.

47:19.736 --> 47:20.934
Talk to me, Bob.

47:20.969 --> 47:22.133
I am the producer.

47:22.168 --> 47:24.067
Speed.

47:31.534 --> 47:33.467
And... action.

47:38.267 --> 47:43.100
*... With the rising tide *

47:53.300 --> 47:55.300
Bet you ain't never seen
no shit like this before.

48:02.300 --> 48:08.367
* I can hardly wait
To feel your lovin' *

48:44.267 --> 48:45.532
You all right?

48:45.567 --> 48:47.601
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I've got a heart thing.

48:47.636 --> 48:49.998
It's no big deal.

48:50.033 --> 48:52.132
<i>* I want you up and down *</i>

48:52.167 --> 48:55.534
<i>Does someone else
have a sweet back?</i>

48:55.569 --> 49:01.133
<i>* Beautiful chocolate brown *</i>

49:01.168 --> 49:02.933
What are they watching?

49:02.968 --> 49:04.601
Some kind of...
black porn thing.

49:04.636 --> 49:05.901
I don't know.

49:07.801 --> 49:08.868
She's hot, right?

49:10.567 --> 49:12.534
Let's go.

49:20.901 --> 49:23.000
<i>The union seemed to buy
our little porno scam.</i>

49:24.601 --> 49:26.200
<i>We were on our way.</i>

49:31.601 --> 49:32.632
Yeah.

49:32.667 --> 49:33.666
You dig that sound?

49:33.701 --> 49:35.434
Yeah, the sound of
your jaw dropping.

49:35.469 --> 49:37.251
Brother, good work.

49:37.286 --> 49:39.209
Man, it was great.

49:39.244 --> 49:41.133
Great first assembly.

49:41.168 --> 49:42.367
Hey, Cosby, man.

49:42.402 --> 49:43.466
Say, hey,

49:43.501 --> 49:45.867
when you going to
light that cigar, man?

49:45.902 --> 49:48.234
When I can afford
to buy me another one.

49:48.269 --> 49:49.499
Oh, please, please.

49:49.534 --> 49:51.167
Listen, I heard about the
three-picture deal, man.

49:51.202 --> 49:52.132
Listen, listen,

49:52.167 --> 49:53.567
I'm doing an independent
right now.

49:53.602 --> 49:54.968
We just had our
first day of dailies.

49:55.003 --> 49:56.132
Powerful shit.
You got a second?

49:56.167 --> 49:57.767
I'll string them up
for you right now.

49:57.802 --> 49:58.799
Excuse me, Mr. Cosby.

49:58.834 --> 50:00.433
We've really got to get
to the airport.

50:00.468 --> 50:02.033
I got to take care
of some business.

50:02.068 --> 50:03.132
Check this out.

50:03.167 --> 50:04.783
They get three strikes,
we only get one.

50:04.818 --> 50:06.400
You sure you know
what you're getting into

50:06.435 --> 50:07.667
with this whole
independent stuff?

50:07.702 --> 50:08.766
Bill, we've got to go.

50:08.801 --> 50:10.267
Hey, listen,
I'll call you, okay?

50:10.302 --> 50:11.866
Number's
still the same?

50:11.901 --> 50:13.401
Listen, you're
looking good too.

50:13.436 --> 50:14.901
Keep on doing
what you're doing.

50:14.936 --> 50:17.601
Hey, man...

50:43.701 --> 50:44.799
Shit.

50:44.834 --> 50:45.933
Someone get
a flashlight.

50:45.968 --> 50:47.367
Melvin, we lost
the generator again.

50:47.402 --> 50:48.632
I see that shit, Clyde.

50:48.667 --> 50:50.434
Reroute the cables,
get that motherfucker back on.

50:50.469 --> 50:52.300
Clyde made another one
of his cut-rate deals

50:52.335 --> 50:53.265
on a generator.

50:53.300 --> 50:54.534
You get what
you pay for.

50:54.569 --> 50:55.668
Bill.
Okay.

50:55.703 --> 50:56.732
Huh?
All right.

50:56.767 --> 50:58.167
Miss Bourgie is here
with the kids.

50:58.202 --> 50:59.466
All right, listen,

50:59.501 --> 51:01.701
we got to cut another day
out of the schedule, man.

51:01.736 --> 51:02.766
No way, man.

51:02.801 --> 51:04.134
The schedule's
too tight already.

51:04.169 --> 51:05.418
What about
all those investors

51:05.453 --> 51:06.860
that were jumping
on the train?

51:06.895 --> 51:08.281
You got 10 grand
to loan me, huh?

51:08.316 --> 51:09.667
That'll buy me another day,
baby.

51:09.702 --> 51:11.400
It is what it is.

51:11.435 --> 51:12.766
What?

51:12.801 --> 51:13.965
We're low on bread,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.200
but you're not really
going to use your own son

51:16.235 --> 51:17.717
in that scene,
are you?

51:17.752 --> 51:19.165
Everybody's somebody's son.

51:19.200 --> 51:22.067
Why would I not use my own kid
if I'd use somebody else's, huh?

51:22.102 --> 51:24.934
Have Nora meet me on the set
with hair and makeup right now.

51:24.969 --> 51:26.434
Bill, hold this.

51:26.469 --> 51:27.566
Hold this.

51:27.601 --> 51:28.732
Melvin, listen.

51:28.767 --> 51:31.265
I know it's none
of my business,

51:31.300 --> 51:33.100
but you can't be
doing this to your own-

51:33.135 --> 51:34.367
The other generator's up.
Come on.

51:34.402 --> 51:35.567
Let's go on the other set.

51:35.602 --> 51:36.868
Come on, Bill.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.200
This kid's got an eye.

51:43.701 --> 51:44.767
See, your father's
too cheap

51:44.802 --> 51:45.917
to use
35 millimeter film.

51:45.952 --> 51:46.998
That's why
we're shooting 16.

51:47.033 --> 51:48.834
You don't need to shoot 35
all the time.

51:48.869 --> 51:49.934
It depends on the shot.

51:49.969 --> 51:51.018
T, that's not a toy.

51:51.053 --> 51:52.067
The sound department.

51:52.102 --> 51:53.199
You're the boss.

51:53.234 --> 51:54.800
All right.
You crumb crushers

51:54.835 --> 51:56.367
are going to be
in the movie.

51:56.402 --> 51:57.332
All right.

51:57.367 --> 51:58.933
You're going to
blow up a cop car,

51:58.968 --> 52:00.400
and you're going to help
Sweetback escape.

52:00.435 --> 52:02.098
Do I get to wear makeup?

52:02.133 --> 52:04.367
Pretty little girls
do not need to wear makeup.

52:04.402 --> 52:06.133
You. You a good actor?

52:06.168 --> 52:07.150
Yeah.

52:07.185 --> 52:08.159
You are?

52:08.194 --> 52:09.197
Yeah.

52:09.232 --> 52:10.165
Good,

52:10.200 --> 52:11.634
because I got another role
for you.

52:11.669 --> 52:13.501
I get to play two roles?

52:13.536 --> 52:14.466
That's right.

52:14.501 --> 52:15.666
I'm going to open the movie

52:15.701 --> 52:18.766
with you playing Sweetback
losing his cherry.

52:18.801 --> 52:21.400
Having sex for the first time.
Nora, take a look at his 'fro.

52:21.435 --> 52:23.699
What'll I be wearing?

52:23.734 --> 52:24.933
Nothing. It's a sex scene.

52:24.968 --> 52:26.098
Cut this all real short

52:26.133 --> 52:27.868
and then cut
some bald patches in it.

52:27.903 --> 52:30.035
Melvin, we need you.

52:30.070 --> 52:32.167
I got to cut my 'fro?

52:32.202 --> 52:33.332
Yeah.

52:33.367 --> 52:34.767
You're a malnutritioned
street kid.

52:34.802 --> 52:36.132
It's the Depression era, okay?

52:36.167 --> 52:37.633
Put some makeup
on the bald patches.

52:37.668 --> 52:39.100
Make it look like ringworm.
What? What?

52:39.135 --> 52:40.868
We got a problem
with the actor...

52:45.234 --> 52:46.634
What the hell's holding us up?

52:46.669 --> 52:48.200
Bob.
Camera's ready.

52:48.235 --> 52:49.251
Let's do it.

52:49.286 --> 52:50.393
Roll sound.

52:50.428 --> 52:51.631
Rolling.

52:51.666 --> 52:52.799
Speed.

52:52.834 --> 52:54.434
Slate.
Camera set.

52:54.469 --> 52:56.098
And... action.

52:56.133 --> 52:57.534
I have not seen
Sweetback.

52:57.569 --> 52:58.599
Cut.

52:58.634 --> 53:00.033
What the fuck happened
to his stutter?

53:00.068 --> 53:01.098
He took speech lessons.

53:01.133 --> 53:02.734
That's what I was trying
to tell you.

53:02.769 --> 53:04.801
He's got a piece.

53:06.834 --> 53:08.866
All right, brother, look,

53:08.901 --> 53:10.265
I need to have
that piece, man.

53:10.300 --> 53:11.901
Well, I-I thought there
might be some trouble.

53:11.936 --> 53:13.868
What the f-fuck
you doing?

53:13.903 --> 53:15.033
Good, back to the mic.

53:15.068 --> 53:16.367
That's it. Again.

53:16.402 --> 53:17.399
Fuck you.

53:17.434 --> 53:19.434
G- give me my g-gun.

53:19.469 --> 53:21.434
Right here.
Right here.

53:21.469 --> 53:22.734
The line. The line.

53:22.769 --> 53:23.833
Action.

53:23.868 --> 53:25.868
S- Sweetback ain't here,
m- motherfucker.

53:25.903 --> 53:27.666
Pissed off.
Go ahead. Again.

53:27.701 --> 53:31.667
S- Sweetback ain't here,
m- motherfucker.

53:31.702 --> 53:33.067
Perfect. Bob?

53:33.102 --> 53:34.065
Got it.

53:34.100 --> 53:35.065
Perfect. Beautiful. Beautiful.

53:35.100 --> 53:36.801
Priscilla,
put this somewhere safe.

53:36.836 --> 53:38.265
All right.
Next set. Let's go.

53:38.300 --> 53:42.501
Uh, Melvin,
can I speak to you for a minute?

53:42.536 --> 53:43.718
All right,
the script supervisor

53:43.753 --> 53:44.866
says we need to shoot
the reverse.

53:44.901 --> 53:46.801
No, I got the whole thing
edited in my head.

53:46.836 --> 53:48.701
I know just what
I need here, Clyde, okay?

53:48.736 --> 53:49.666
Melvin.
What?

53:49.701 --> 53:50.900
He said it's not
going to cut

53:50.935 --> 53:52.017
unless we get the reverse.

53:52.052 --> 53:53.076
All right,
I'll handle this.

53:53.111 --> 53:54.100
You, Script,
come over here.

53:54.135 --> 53:55.098
Come over here.

53:55.133 --> 53:56.734
Tell you what.
Give me this right here.

53:56.769 --> 53:57.699
Here, okay.

53:57.734 --> 53:58.934
Now, you are getting
a promotion.

53:58.969 --> 54:00.098
You're going to be an actor.

54:00.133 --> 54:01.734
I want you to stand
right over there

54:01.769 --> 54:03.566
in that light.

54:03.601 --> 54:04.934
Go ahead.
In the light.

54:04.969 --> 54:07.032
Everybody,

54:07.067 --> 54:08.601
I'm doing
the fucking script now, okay?

54:08.636 --> 54:10.067
Next set. Let's go.

54:18.033 --> 54:19.566
<i>The scene with the dirty cops</i>

54:19.601 --> 54:21.067
<i>was the one
that divided the crew.</i>

54:21.102 --> 54:22.418
<i>He doesn't look
very tough to me.</i>

54:22.453 --> 54:23.734
<i>Does he look tough
to you?</i>

54:23.769 --> 54:25.065
<i>Nah.</i>

54:25.100 --> 54:26.133
<i>Don't look too tough.</i>

54:27.133 --> 54:29.066
<i>Don't mark
his face.</i>

54:29.101 --> 54:30.617
<i>Hey, Sweetback.</i>

54:30.652 --> 54:32.098
<i>I'm sorry, man.</i>

54:32.133 --> 54:34.067
<i>I forgot you two
were attached together.</i>

54:34.102 --> 54:35.451
<i>Let's see
if we can get...</i>

54:35.486 --> 54:36.766
<i>White folks</i>

54:36.801 --> 54:39.499
<i>would never experience
racial brutality.</i>

54:39.534 --> 54:41.367
<i>Couldn't really believe
that a double standard existed</i>

54:41.402 --> 54:43.732
<i>for minorities.</i>

54:43.767 --> 54:45.701
<i>Stay home at night,
you wouldn't...</i>

54:45.736 --> 54:46.833
<i>Black folks,</i>

54:46.868 --> 54:48.432
<i>who had lived it,</i>

54:48.467 --> 54:50.567
<i>were more than ready
to see someone</i>

54:50.602 --> 54:51.701
<i>stand up against racism...</i>

54:51.736 --> 54:53.265
Fuck the pigs up!

54:53.300 --> 54:55.483
<i>even when it hid
behind a badge.</i>

54:55.518 --> 54:57.667
Help the brother out,
Sweetback.

55:00.801 --> 55:02.400
Got a new thing
right there.

55:02.435 --> 55:03.666
Come on, Sweetback.

55:03.701 --> 55:07.734
Fuck him up.
Right on, Sweetback.

55:07.769 --> 55:09.032
Yeah.

55:09.067 --> 55:10.265
It's about time.

55:10.300 --> 55:12.567
Never seen nothing
like this.

55:15.033 --> 55:16.532
<i>Thanks, man.</i>

55:16.567 --> 55:18.599
Righteous.

55:18.634 --> 55:21.367
<i>He's just a child.</i>

55:21.402 --> 55:23.351
Huh?

55:23.386 --> 55:25.265
Mario.

55:25.300 --> 55:26.968
He's barely 13,
Melvin.

55:28.868 --> 55:31.601
When I was 8, I was already
working the cash register

55:31.636 --> 55:33.965
at my dad's tailor shop.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.766
<i>He gave me old clothes to sell.</i>

55:35.801 --> 55:38.184
<i>Old reject shit
that folks left behind.</i>

55:38.219 --> 55:40.532
<i>Here comes
this skinny little kid</i>

55:40.567 --> 55:43.483
<i>with a wagonload
full of shitty clothes.</i>

55:43.518 --> 55:45.726
Boy, you got
to work often,

55:45.761 --> 55:47.934
and that's only the beginning.

55:50.601 --> 55:51.834
You think I liked that?

55:51.869 --> 55:54.265
Hmm?

55:54.300 --> 55:57.383
You think I even liked my dad
back then?

55:57.418 --> 56:00.467
I got my ass whooped
damn near every day,

56:00.502 --> 56:01.566
and every day,

56:01.601 --> 56:03.551
Daddy sent me
right back on the streets,

56:03.586 --> 56:05.501
selling them old,
fucked up clothes,

56:05.536 --> 56:09.165
until I learned

56:09.200 --> 56:13.767
how to give the gangsters
some free shit

56:13.802 --> 56:15.934
to protect me from those bullies

56:15.969 --> 56:18.134
while I sold
those clothes

56:18.169 --> 56:20.265
to the winos
and the junkies.

56:20.300 --> 56:23.133
My dad had taught me
how to survive,

56:23.168 --> 56:24.365
how to hustle.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.801
I'm not in the tailor business
anymore.

56:26.836 --> 56:29.098
I'm in the movie business.

56:29.133 --> 56:31.801
My kids want to be
in this shit, hey.

56:31.836 --> 56:33.534
It is what it is.

56:36.834 --> 56:38.501
I just think he's
ready to go home

56:38.536 --> 56:40.901
and be with his mama.

56:40.936 --> 56:42.185
No shit.

56:42.220 --> 56:43.399
Shit.

56:43.434 --> 56:44.834
We don't always get
what we want,

56:44.869 --> 56:46.032
do we?

56:46.067 --> 56:47.501
What if his friends
see the movie?

56:47.536 --> 56:48.734
He's going to be
embarrassed.

56:48.769 --> 56:49.833
Fuck his friends.

56:49.868 --> 56:51.968
His friends
ain't paying college.

56:53.634 --> 56:57.334
Well, at least let him
keep his afro.

56:59.601 --> 57:01.834
That wig lady thinks
she can make him a skin wig.

57:01.869 --> 57:03.351
It'll look natural.

57:03.386 --> 57:04.799
It'll be perfect.

57:04.834 --> 57:08.133
Of course she does,
and a skin wig costs money.

57:08.168 --> 57:10.968
I don't have the bread
to pamper him,

57:11.003 --> 57:11.965
or you,

57:12.000 --> 57:13.467
or any other
motherfucker,

57:13.502 --> 57:14.499
and if I did,

57:14.534 --> 57:16.133
I'd fix
the focus on B Camera first

57:16.168 --> 57:17.098
and I'd buy more film.

57:17.133 --> 57:18.534
Mario can grow more hair later.

57:18.569 --> 57:19.751
I can't grow more film.

57:19.786 --> 57:20.899
Melvin, listen to yourself.

57:20.934 --> 57:22.501
You're cutting
the boy's hair off

57:22.536 --> 57:23.818
and you're forcing him

57:23.853 --> 57:25.065
to be in a sex scene.

57:25.100 --> 57:27.033
It's not real. It's acting.

57:27.068 --> 57:28.566
He wants to act.

57:28.601 --> 57:29.601
He's in a motherfucking movie.

57:29.636 --> 57:30.601
He should be happy.

57:30.636 --> 57:31.566
What?

57:31.601 --> 57:33.065
He's tough. He's resilient.

57:33.100 --> 57:34.701
He's an ambitious
little motherfucker.

57:34.736 --> 57:35.799
He can handle it.

57:35.834 --> 57:37.399
What if he can't handle it?

57:37.434 --> 57:39.267
Are you going to risk
fucking up his childhood

57:39.302 --> 57:40.432
just because
yours was fucked up?

57:40.467 --> 57:42.767
You want to turn him
into some macho stud man

57:42.802 --> 57:45.467
like you think
you're supposed to be?

57:45.502 --> 57:47.501
I'm going to split.

57:47.536 --> 57:48.998
I'm out.

57:49.033 --> 57:50.300
Of course you are.

57:52.300 --> 57:55.434
You got to go
screw everything that moves?

57:55.469 --> 57:57.701
That's what this shit is about?
Huh?

57:57.736 --> 57:58.799
Me and chicks?

57:58.834 --> 58:00.851
No, it's not about you
and your chicks.

58:00.886 --> 58:02.868
It's about you
not respecting anyone.

58:02.903 --> 58:05.135
Not even your own son.

58:05.170 --> 58:06.785
You know what you are?

58:06.820 --> 58:08.365
You're a nice sister

58:08.400 --> 58:09.800
who has no idea
what it's like

58:09.835 --> 58:11.165
on the other side
of the tracks.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.365
None. And maybe
you don't respect the fact

58:13.400 --> 58:15.601
that I know my own kid
better than he knows himself.

58:15.636 --> 58:17.000
I know what the fuck
I'm doing

58:17.035 --> 58:18.434
and he can handle it.

58:18.469 --> 58:19.799
He can handle it.

58:19.834 --> 58:22.367
Why don't you ask Bill,

58:22.402 --> 58:23.466
or Clyde,

58:23.501 --> 58:24.901
or that crazy-ass
assistant of yours,

58:24.936 --> 58:26.132
Priscilla?

58:26.167 --> 58:29.234
If they ain't too scared
to tell you the truth.

58:29.269 --> 58:31.300
My grandmother used to call it,
uh...

58:31.335 --> 58:33.234
listening with half an ear.

58:33.269 --> 58:34.666
Dig?

58:34.701 --> 58:37.532
Well, Melvin,

58:37.567 --> 58:40.801
he'll listen with, like,
a third of an ear.

58:40.836 --> 58:42.734
<i>It was Melvin.</i>

58:42.769 --> 58:44.051
His kids.

58:44.086 --> 58:45.299
His dad.

58:45.334 --> 58:46.299
A family affair.

58:46.334 --> 58:47.933
And we were all a part of it.

58:47.968 --> 58:51.351
We all had a role to play in it,
like it or not.

58:51.386 --> 58:54.734
Black man's got to work
twice as hard to get hits.

58:54.769 --> 58:56.101
That's what I'm talking about.

58:56.136 --> 58:57.851
Can't be afraid of hard work.

58:57.886 --> 58:59.567
I wasn't hard on the boy.

58:59.602 --> 59:01.801
That's a fact.

59:20.601 --> 59:21.866
How much?

59:21.901 --> 59:23.701
Short answer's all I
could get for 50 bucks.

59:23.736 --> 59:25.033
Fucking actors
kept dropping lines.

59:25.068 --> 59:26.032
Eight fucking takes.

59:26.067 --> 59:27.467
You got to buy
enough film, man.

59:27.502 --> 59:28.735
Well, film costs money.

59:28.770 --> 59:29.933
So does down-time, Clyde.

59:29.968 --> 59:31.567
Every minute that crew's
sitting on their ass,

59:31.602 --> 59:32.532
that's costing us.

59:32.567 --> 59:33.567
Just get what you need.

59:33.602 --> 59:34.566
With what?

59:34.601 --> 59:36.251
How the fuck
was I supposed to know

59:36.286 --> 59:37.901
the bitch wouldn't know
her damn lines?

59:37.936 --> 59:38.952
Why aren't we shooting?

59:38.987 --> 59:40.027
Camera's reloading, chief.

59:40.062 --> 59:41.067
How long's
he been waiting?

59:41.102 --> 59:42.032
Too long.

59:42.067 --> 59:44.767
Quiet on the set.

59:44.802 --> 59:45.801
Roll sound.

59:45.836 --> 59:47.085
Rolling!

59:47.120 --> 59:48.243
Speed.

59:48.278 --> 59:49.332
A Camera.

59:49.367 --> 59:50.834
A Camera's rolling.

59:50.869 --> 59:51.866
B Camera.

59:51.901 --> 59:52.934
B Camera ready.

59:53.634 --> 59:57.332
And... action.

59:57.367 --> 59:58.766
Little smile, ladies.

59:58.801 --> 01:00:01.334
Looking at me
right here.

01:00:01.369 --> 01:00:03.418
At me, me, me.

01:00:03.453 --> 01:00:05.432
And good and cut.

01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:07.667
You're up next,
little man.

01:00:07.702 --> 01:00:08.868
Time to get ready.

01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.333
Hey, Clyde, uh,
what time tomorrow?

01:00:12.368 --> 01:00:14.000
Can you wait
for the call sheets?

01:00:14.035 --> 01:00:15.199
I got to go to court.

01:00:15.234 --> 01:00:18.501
José, you're killing me.
All right?

01:00:18.536 --> 01:00:22.065
Show me the sides.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.501
There, right above the ear.

01:00:24.536 --> 01:00:25.551
See that, Nora?

01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:26.576
Smooth that down.

01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:27.589
Yeah, we can see.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.695
Cover it with makeup.

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:29.732
I think it'll work fine.

01:00:29.767 --> 01:00:31.467
I didn't ask you
what you think, Clyde.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.616
All right, let's do it.

01:00:35.651 --> 01:00:36.998
We got a movie to shoot.

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:39.165
Scene two,
opening sequence.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.067
Young Sweetback
loses his virginity.

01:00:46.634 --> 01:00:49.501
Thank you for letting him
wear the skin wig

01:00:49.536 --> 01:00:51.133
and not cutting his hair off.

01:00:51.168 --> 01:00:52.098
Oh, that's just the way

01:00:52.133 --> 01:00:53.098
things worked out
this time.

01:00:53.133 --> 01:00:54.567
We've still got
a scene to shoot.

01:00:54.602 --> 01:00:57.567
Am I going to
see you later?

01:00:57.602 --> 01:00:58.768
I don't know.

01:00:58.803 --> 01:01:01.085
I don't think so.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.332
Suit yourself.

01:01:03.367 --> 01:01:07.432
Megan wants to go
shopping with me.

01:01:07.467 --> 01:01:09.334
Don't buy her anything
you can't afford,

01:01:09.369 --> 01:01:10.801
because I ain't paying it back.

01:01:13.067 --> 01:01:14.467
Bye, Melvin.

01:01:16.033 --> 01:01:17.601
Come on, baby.

01:01:20.234 --> 01:01:22.701
Hey, uh, I'm going to
pick a second meal, man.

01:01:22.736 --> 01:01:24.165
What should I get?

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.834
Something cheap.
Real cheap.

01:01:26.869 --> 01:01:28.699
Want some licorice?

01:01:28.734 --> 01:01:30.501
Nora, can I
see you here?

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.000
<i>Hey, little man.</i>

01:01:35.035 --> 01:01:37.701
<i>Come here.</i>

01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:40.701
<i>Get these clothes off.</i>

01:01:40.736 --> 01:01:41.567
Damn.

01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:47.300
<i>Unbutton it.</i>

01:01:49.567 --> 01:01:51.365
<i>Don't worry, sugar.</i>

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.501
<i>You ain't getting
your picture taken.</i>

01:01:53.536 --> 01:01:55.101
<i>Come on.</i>

01:01:55.136 --> 01:01:56.401
<i>Move.</i>

01:01:56.436 --> 01:01:57.632
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:58.667
<i>That's it.</i>

01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:01.584
Damn, man,
I wish that shit was me.

01:02:01.619 --> 01:02:03.501
I didn't get my dick wet
till I was 18

01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:06.367
and she was
double bag ugly.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.732
Well...

01:02:11.767 --> 01:02:12.866
Uh, darling,

01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:14.300
we're going to go
grab some dinner.

01:02:14.335 --> 01:02:15.501
All right, cool.
Get a bite.

01:02:15.536 --> 01:02:16.768
I'll catch up to you.

01:02:16.803 --> 01:02:18.000
All right, let's go.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Hungry?

01:02:22.035 --> 01:02:23.017
Melvin?

01:02:23.052 --> 01:02:23.965
What?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.400
My boyfriend
wants to talk to you.

01:02:25.435 --> 01:02:26.767
What the fuck
is wrong now?

01:02:26.802 --> 01:02:28.151
He just wants
to talk to you.

01:02:28.186 --> 01:02:29.501
I ain't got time for this shit.

01:02:29.536 --> 01:02:30.501
This is my man,
Maurice.

01:02:30.536 --> 01:02:31.532
Hey, brother.

01:02:31.567 --> 01:02:33.000
It's good to meet you,
brother.

01:02:33.035 --> 01:02:34.451
Look, man,
I got to tell you,

01:02:34.486 --> 01:02:35.868
the shit you are
putting down

01:02:35.903 --> 01:02:36.866
is right on.

01:02:36.901 --> 01:02:38.265
Now, I know
you don't know me,

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.300
but I need to do
the music on this, man.

01:02:40.335 --> 01:02:41.501
I can do whatever
you need.

01:02:41.536 --> 01:02:42.466
Look, man-

01:02:42.501 --> 01:02:43.901
No, Priscilla,
she hipped me to it,

01:02:43.936 --> 01:02:44.998
all right?

01:02:45.033 --> 01:02:46.783
I know you don't have
a lot of cash,

01:02:46.818 --> 01:02:48.534
but we could really
use this chance.

01:02:48.569 --> 01:02:49.732
We?

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:50.899
My new band.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:51.968
What do y'all call yourselves?

01:02:52.003 --> 01:02:54.265
Earth, Wind & Fire.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.467
All right,
this is how it works.

01:02:56.502 --> 01:02:57.899
What I sing, you play.

01:02:57.934 --> 01:03:00.334
If I like what I hear-
if I like what I hear-

01:03:00.369 --> 01:03:01.532
we got a deal.

01:03:01.567 --> 01:03:03.234
All right.
Sounds good, man.

01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:04.866
You ain't me heard sing yet.

01:03:04.901 --> 01:03:06.634
I don't know shit
about no gun, man!

01:03:06.669 --> 01:03:09.732
Fuck!

01:03:09.767 --> 01:03:12.167
What's your malfunction, man?

01:03:12.202 --> 01:03:14.001
G- go get my...

01:03:14.036 --> 01:03:15.766
my piece, nigga.

01:03:15.801 --> 01:03:17.501
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:17.536 --> 01:03:18.801
Slow your roll.

01:03:18.836 --> 01:03:20.032
My apologies.

01:03:20.067 --> 01:03:21.667
I thought you got
your piece back, okay?

01:03:21.702 --> 01:03:22.632
Priscilla,

01:03:22.667 --> 01:03:23.934
what happened
to his.357?

01:03:23.969 --> 01:03:24.933
The pistol?

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.517
Yeah, from the other day.

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:28.067
Oh, I put it
in the prop box

01:03:28.102 --> 01:03:29.801
with the other guns.

01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:34.899
What?

01:03:34.934 --> 01:03:36.534
<i>A loaded gun in the prop box?</i>

01:03:39.501 --> 01:03:43.100
<i>The actors had been
in and out of that prop box</i>

01:03:43.135 --> 01:03:45.265
<i>at least 100 times,</i>

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.567
<i>all to get their guns...</i>

01:03:46.602 --> 01:03:48.032
<i>Police specials,</i>

01:03:48.067 --> 01:03:50.334
<i>just like that brother's
loaded one.</i>

01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:52.432
What?

01:03:52.467 --> 01:03:55.267
<i>Sometime,
I suppose when I get the time,</i>

01:03:55.302 --> 01:03:57.033
<i>I'll have
reoccurring nightmares</i>

01:03:57.068 --> 01:03:58.467
<i>about that escape.</i>

01:04:04.133 --> 01:04:05.900
Mario.

01:04:05.935 --> 01:04:07.667
Hey.

01:04:10.567 --> 01:04:12.200
I know you're awake.

01:04:16.734 --> 01:04:19.868
Look, son, I want
to tell you that...

01:04:25.234 --> 01:04:26.834
you don't have
to sleep on the floor.

01:04:26.869 --> 01:04:28.601
Sleep...
Sleep on the bed.

01:04:28.636 --> 01:04:31.901
I'll take the couch.

01:04:31.936 --> 01:04:34.199
Mario.

01:04:34.234 --> 01:04:37.067
Suit yourself.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.133
<i>President Nixon
had no comment...</i>

01:04:48.168 --> 01:04:50.065
Oh.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.033
Your dick's on fire too?

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.165
Where's second unit, man?

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.601
I thought they'd be here by now.

01:04:56.636 --> 01:04:57.666
Oh, the lab called

01:04:57.701 --> 01:04:59.300
and the dailies
aren't going to be ready

01:04:59.335 --> 01:05:00.367
till Monday.

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:05.965
Yeah.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.165
<i>We got arrested, Mel.</i>

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.200
You got to come down here
and get us out.

01:05:09.235 --> 01:05:10.332
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

01:05:10.367 --> 01:05:11.968
We were heading back
from the shoot and...

01:05:13.467 --> 01:05:14.767
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:05:18.167 --> 01:05:19.434
* Yeah *

01:05:22.701 --> 01:05:24.534
<i>The pigs, they pulled us over.</i>

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.165
<i>You're not going to
believe this.</i>

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.968
<i>They thought my telephoto lens
was a bazooka.</i>

01:05:31.003 --> 01:05:32.234
Outside of the truck.
Hands against it.

01:05:33.634 --> 01:05:34.933
Let's go. Come on!

01:05:34.968 --> 01:05:36.534
Put that down!
Put that down!

01:05:36.569 --> 01:05:37.467
Right here.
Right here.

01:05:39.133 --> 01:05:41.433
You one of them
Black Panthers, boy?

01:05:41.468 --> 01:05:43.734
<i>What are they
holding you for?</i>

01:05:43.769 --> 01:05:44.899
Grand theft.

01:05:44.934 --> 01:05:46.334
They saw us with
all that equipment,

01:05:46.369 --> 01:05:47.734
they figured
it must have been stolen,

01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:48.934
so they impounded all of it,

01:05:48.969 --> 01:05:49.899
<i>including the truck.</i>

01:05:49.934 --> 01:05:51.334
Did you show them
your receipts, José?

01:05:51.369 --> 01:05:52.632
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:54.501
I showed them everything.
They thought it was funny.

01:05:54.536 --> 01:05:55.834
Excuse me. I'm not through yet.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:56.767
<i>José.</i>

01:06:00.901 --> 01:06:03.717
Get on it, man.
Call a lawyer.

01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:06.476
What lawyer, man?
With what money?

01:06:06.511 --> 01:06:09.200
Oh, come on,
for crying out loud.

01:06:09.235 --> 01:06:10.265
This is our equipment.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.734
Some of that's
my personal stuff.

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:14.200
What's the charge?

01:06:15.467 --> 01:06:17.133
Charge of being black.

01:06:17.168 --> 01:06:20.165
Welcome aboard.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.234
You're a real nigga now.

01:06:40.801 --> 01:06:42.033
When's Van Peebles
getting us out?

01:06:42.068 --> 01:06:43.234
Soon.
He's coming soon.

01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:44.299
Yeah.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.334
He fucking better.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:46.632
Shit.

01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:49.067
He fucking better.

01:06:49.102 --> 01:06:51.467
Sick of this shit.

01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:05.132
<i>Hello.</i>

01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:06.868
Yeah, man, it's me, Melvin.

01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:16.833
Hold on a second, man.

01:07:16.868 --> 01:07:20.801
Learn how to play
some tennis.

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:24.098
Hey, Mel, you okay?

01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:25.332
My crew
just got arrested.

01:07:25.367 --> 01:07:27.167
I don't know if I'm
going to make it.

01:07:27.202 --> 01:07:28.632
I'm tapped out.

01:07:28.667 --> 01:07:30.133
I got to finish
this movie.

01:07:30.168 --> 01:07:31.767
I got to do it right.

01:07:31.802 --> 01:07:33.332
So how much you need?

01:07:33.367 --> 01:07:35.734
To get me through post, a lot.

01:07:35.769 --> 01:07:37.267
Well, how much?

01:07:37.302 --> 01:07:40.067
50,000.

01:07:48.367 --> 01:07:49.467
Cosby came through.

01:07:49.502 --> 01:07:50.532
He fucked us, man.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:51.799
It's the start of the weekend.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.834
There're no judges available
till Monday.

01:07:57.501 --> 01:07:59.566
You go down there
and you visit him.

01:07:59.601 --> 01:08:02.200
It'll do the troops good
for them to see you.

01:08:02.235 --> 01:08:03.432
No.

01:08:03.467 --> 01:08:05.067
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:08:05.102 --> 01:08:06.032
No. No.

01:08:06.067 --> 01:08:07.133
Right now,
to those cops,

01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:08.199
Melvin Van Peebles

01:08:08.234 --> 01:08:09.534
is some white,
aristocratic Dutch guy,

01:08:09.569 --> 01:08:10.499
right?

01:08:10.534 --> 01:08:11.899
I show up with my black ass

01:08:11.934 --> 01:08:13.133
to start singing
"We Shall Overcome"

01:08:13.168 --> 01:08:14.098
with the troops,

01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:16.000
they throw us all the fuck
in jail.

01:08:16.035 --> 01:08:16.965
We got three days left

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.997
of filming
this motherfucker.

01:08:18.033 --> 01:08:19.234
We'll jeopardize
the whole film, man.

01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:20.501
Fuck the film, man!
Fuck it!

01:08:20.536 --> 01:08:21.698
Fuck the fucking film, man.

01:08:21.734 --> 01:08:24.133
This is our crew behind bars
on bullshit charges.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:25.133
Doesn't that bother you?

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.265
Yeah,

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.698
it's been bothering me
for 400 years!

01:08:27.734 --> 01:08:29.133
That's why we're
shooting this shit, Bill!

01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:30.533
Oh, man, don't give me
that 400...

01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:31.698
Fuck it, I'll go by myself.

01:08:31.734 --> 01:08:33.734
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hold the fuck up.

01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:34.899
Here's what the fuck
you do.

01:08:34.934 --> 01:08:36.533
You go home.
You cool the fuck down.

01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:37.499
Monday morning,

01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:39.098
you put on
a nice white guy suit,

01:08:39.133 --> 01:08:41.033
you go down there,
and you bail them out.

01:08:41.068 --> 01:08:42.934
Any emotional liberal shit
you do right now

01:08:42.969 --> 01:08:45.567
will only jeopardize our crew.

01:08:45.602 --> 01:08:46.667
Do you hear me?

01:08:46.702 --> 01:08:49.232
Yeah.

01:08:49.267 --> 01:08:52.399
I hear you.

01:08:56.367 --> 01:08:58.100
<i>Hey, he'd sacrifice
his friends,</i>

01:08:58.135 --> 01:09:00.401
<i>his family,</i>

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:02.631
even me.

01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:04.466
Well, a black man in jail
who's not afraid

01:09:04.502 --> 01:09:05.532
is a fool,

01:09:05.567 --> 01:09:08.501
but I heard Big T
was crying like a bitch,

01:09:08.536 --> 01:09:12.631
crying for his mama.

01:09:12.667 --> 01:09:14.649
I wasn't scared of shit
in that jail, man.

01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:16.634
I was scared of being hungry,
that's all.

01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:23.334
Please, folks,
this is sound equipment.

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:24.435
Sound equipment?

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:25.818
Please stand back.

01:09:25.853 --> 01:09:28.542
Y'all making
a movie?

01:09:28.578 --> 01:09:31.198
I can do Flip Wilson.

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:32.634
Get the fuck
out of the way.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.032
Move.

01:09:34.067 --> 01:09:35.399
How many extras we got?

01:09:35.435 --> 01:09:36.432
Seven.

01:09:36.466 --> 01:09:37.832
I need more.

01:09:37.868 --> 01:09:39.234
Melvin,
we got a problem.

01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:40.600
We only got four mags of film.

01:09:40.636 --> 01:09:41.799
Fuck.

01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:43.934
If everything went perfect,
I'd need five.

01:09:43.969 --> 01:09:46.000
I told Clyde six.
Where's Clyde?

01:09:46.035 --> 01:09:47.232
Clyde!

01:09:47.267 --> 01:09:49.033
Two men, two women?

01:09:49.068 --> 01:09:50.098
Fine.

01:09:50.133 --> 01:09:51.832
Damage control.

01:09:51.868 --> 01:09:53.032
Some of them are pissed

01:09:53.067 --> 01:09:54.632
about spending the weekend
in jail.

01:09:54.667 --> 01:09:56.634
Now, if T quits,
the others might follow.

01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:57.799
Bill tells me
we only have

01:09:57.834 --> 01:09:59.450
four mags of film
for the whole day.

01:09:59.485 --> 01:10:01.067
Uh, really,
that should be plenty.

01:10:01.102 --> 01:10:02.899
I asked you for six.

01:10:02.934 --> 01:10:04.734
Well, I needed the money
for the stunt man

01:10:04.769 --> 01:10:05.899
for the L.A. river chase.

01:10:05.934 --> 01:10:07.534
Now you saw what happened
when Bill tried.

01:10:07.569 --> 01:10:09.401
Clyde, I can
do that stunt myself.

01:10:09.436 --> 01:10:11.234
What I can't do
is shoot without film.

01:10:11.269 --> 01:10:12.434
Did you sign off on this?

01:10:12.469 --> 01:10:13.799
No, no.

01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:15.065
Okay, here's what I want.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.300
You, Bill,
go get all those people

01:10:16.335 --> 01:10:17.618
away from
the sound equipment.

01:10:17.653 --> 01:10:18.901
I want to start
our first shot

01:10:18.936 --> 01:10:19.866
in 20 minutes.

01:10:19.901 --> 01:10:20.998
We're going to start

01:10:21.033 --> 01:10:22.234
with the cops
bringing Sweetback out.

01:10:22.269 --> 01:10:23.199
Isn't that
Clyde's job, man?

01:10:23.234 --> 01:10:24.434
Not anymore.
Clyde, you're fired.

01:10:24.469 --> 01:10:25.699
This shit is not my fault.

01:10:25.734 --> 01:10:27.817
Now, there's only so much
I can do with no money,

01:10:27.852 --> 01:10:29.901
but if you're looking
for somebody to blame-

01:10:29.936 --> 01:10:31.032
Right, it's my fault.

01:10:31.067 --> 01:10:32.833
I got you in over your
head. I'm sorry.

01:10:32.868 --> 01:10:34.868
When I get a bigger budget
or a smaller film,

01:10:34.903 --> 01:10:37.068
I'll give you a call.

01:10:37.103 --> 01:10:39.234
This is bullshit, Melvin!

01:10:42.234 --> 01:10:43.501
T, I need to talk to you.

01:10:52.734 --> 01:10:54.098
We got a problem?

01:10:54.133 --> 01:10:57.098
Yeah, brother,
we got a problem.

01:10:57.133 --> 01:11:00.333
I work with niggas,
I end up in jail.

01:11:00.368 --> 01:11:03.534
Some shit like that
go down again,

01:11:03.569 --> 01:11:05.299
I'm going to break me

01:11:05.334 --> 01:11:07.617
some little
motherfucker neck.

01:11:07.652 --> 01:11:09.866
T, you're a big
motherfucker.

01:11:09.901 --> 01:11:11.701
In a fair fight,
you'd whoop my ass.

01:11:11.736 --> 01:11:13.501
I ain't fought fair
in a long time,

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:14.918
and if I was
afraid of you,

01:11:14.953 --> 01:11:16.300
I wouldn't be
the kind of nigga

01:11:16.335 --> 01:11:17.399
to get that shit done

01:11:17.434 --> 01:11:19.584
in the first
motherfucking place!

01:11:19.619 --> 01:11:21.734
I got everything I own
on the line,

01:11:21.769 --> 01:11:23.218
and all my family's shit,

01:11:23.253 --> 01:11:24.632
but it's
bigger than me,

01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:26.467
and it's bigger than
your two days in jail.

01:11:26.502 --> 01:11:28.584
This is a war,

01:11:28.619 --> 01:11:30.632
it's our war,

01:11:30.667 --> 01:11:32.667
and if you don't know by now
that's your war,

01:11:32.702 --> 01:11:34.267
take your big ass
back to your shed

01:11:34.302 --> 01:11:35.566
and your smoked meat.

01:11:35.601 --> 01:11:36.833
No hard feelings, brother.

01:11:36.868 --> 01:11:40.567
We got three days left
to shoot,

01:11:40.602 --> 01:11:42.332
so if you stay,

01:11:42.367 --> 01:11:44.500
and brother, I hope you do,

01:11:44.535 --> 01:11:46.599
don't ever threaten me again.

01:11:46.634 --> 01:11:49.133
Just step to me
and take me the fuck out,

01:11:49.168 --> 01:11:50.799
before I take you,

01:11:50.834 --> 01:11:56.234
because I'm going to have
to take you seriously, T.

01:11:56.269 --> 01:11:59.934
T, this is our shit.

01:12:09.767 --> 01:12:11.367
Hey, yo, that fool
with the glasses

01:12:11.402 --> 01:12:13.151
said he gonna put me
in the movie, man.

01:12:13.186 --> 01:12:14.901
Please, you got to move
these people back.

01:12:14.936 --> 01:12:16.566
Okay, uh, all right, uh...

01:12:16.601 --> 01:12:18.033
Hey, my good brothers
and sisters,

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:18.998
let's, uh...

01:12:19.033 --> 01:12:20.417
let's move it on back, please.

01:12:20.452 --> 01:12:21.766
I ain't your brother, Casper.

01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:24.000
Man, I'll beat your white ass
back across that freeway.

01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:24.998
Don't come here

01:12:25.033 --> 01:12:26.466
telling us
where we can't be.

01:12:26.501 --> 01:12:28.501
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Peace, peace, okay?

01:12:28.536 --> 01:12:30.432
Let's just, uh,
back it up.

01:12:30.467 --> 01:12:32.866
All right. All right.
Excellent.

01:12:32.901 --> 01:12:34.667
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:12:34.702 --> 01:12:35.734
Thank you.

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.934
Sound is ready, boss.

01:12:58.133 --> 01:12:59.700
Camera set.

01:12:59.735 --> 01:13:01.067
Kids, get in.

01:13:01.102 --> 01:13:02.400
Frame up.

01:13:06.701 --> 01:13:08.534
It's out of focus.

01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:14.367
Looks sharp to me, chief.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.400
Okay, frame up.

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:18.434
T.

01:13:19.467 --> 01:13:20.817
Rolling.

01:13:20.852 --> 01:13:22.009
Slate.

01:13:22.044 --> 01:13:23.132
Action.

01:13:23.167 --> 01:13:24.332
Wash your car,
mister?

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:25.833
No charge if you
don't like it.

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:28.334
Yeah, no charge
if you don't like it.

01:13:28.369 --> 01:13:30.566
Okay, Bob?
Got it.

01:13:30.601 --> 01:13:31.799
Okay, cut! All right,
everybody out.

01:13:31.834 --> 01:13:33.234
We're going to
blow this motherfucker up.

01:13:33.269 --> 01:13:34.199
I need everybody back.

01:13:34.234 --> 01:13:35.567
Get all those people
back over there.

01:13:44.534 --> 01:13:46.499
Fire engine!
They called a fire engine!

01:13:46.534 --> 01:13:47.934
Someone must have called
the fire department.

01:13:47.969 --> 01:13:49.734
We got to get
the hell out of here.

01:13:49.769 --> 01:13:50.899
No, no, no, hold on.

01:13:50.934 --> 01:13:52.434
That's why we got
the permits on Friday,

01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:53.934
so they couldn't notify
the fire department.

01:13:53.969 --> 01:13:55.400
You can't buy this kind
of production value.

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.599
Tommy, get over here.

01:13:57.634 --> 01:13:59.799
Listen, fire department's
going to show up soon.

01:13:59.834 --> 01:14:01.834
Don't show them the permit
till the last possible second.

01:14:01.869 --> 01:14:03.098
I'll get the production value.

01:14:03.133 --> 01:14:04.501
Sweetback's
going to make his escape.

01:14:04.536 --> 01:14:06.634
Roll the cameras. Go!

01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:14.701
<i>Somehow we got that shot.</i>

01:14:14.736 --> 01:14:16.501
<i>With the Cosby money,</i>

01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:18.232
<i>a deal from the labs,</i>

01:14:18.267 --> 01:14:21.067
<i>and my borrowing
from anyone I could,</i>

01:14:21.102 --> 01:14:22.432
<i>our little ragtag crew</i>

01:14:22.467 --> 01:14:24.901
<i>managed to make it
through the end of the shoot.</i>

01:14:24.936 --> 01:14:27.000
<i>Trial by fire
will singe your ass,</i>

01:14:27.035 --> 01:14:29.232
<i>but it also bonds.</i>

01:14:29.267 --> 01:14:31.801
<i>We'd become
more than comrades in arms.</i>

01:14:31.836 --> 01:14:33.767
<i>We were family.</i>

01:14:40.467 --> 01:14:41.732
Smoked turkey?

01:14:41.767 --> 01:14:43.917
Last you're going to see
in a while.

01:14:43.952 --> 01:14:46.067
Tommy's taking me
on his next film.

01:14:46.102 --> 01:14:49.466
Teach him
how to make sound.

01:14:49.501 --> 01:14:50.801
Somebody's got
to learn this shit

01:14:50.836 --> 01:14:52.666
before I retire.

01:14:52.701 --> 01:14:54.801
That's fucking great.

01:14:54.836 --> 01:14:56.901
That's beautiful.

01:14:56.936 --> 01:14:57.866
Beautiful.

01:14:57.901 --> 01:14:59.450
Come here.
Oh!

01:14:59.485 --> 01:15:01.000
Hey, Melvin.

01:15:01.035 --> 01:15:02.065
Huh?

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.100
Allow me
to introduce you.

01:15:03.135 --> 01:15:04.232
This is Jimmy,

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.934
the best editor
no money can buy.

01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:08.466
Jimmy, you up for spending

01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:10.132
long hours in a dark room
with me?

01:15:10.167 --> 01:15:12.534
Because I'm a motherfucker
to work with.

01:15:12.569 --> 01:15:14.035
Fun is the enemy, sir.

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:16.752
I see you've been briefed.

01:15:16.787 --> 01:15:19.434
All right, welcome aboard.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.900
<i>I'll tell you one thing
right now.</i>

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.666
Independent filmmaking
would not exist

01:15:24.701 --> 01:15:28.517
had Melvin not put a "Van"
in the middle of his name.

01:15:28.552 --> 01:15:32.334
You know, when you're clowning
and making the man laugh,

01:15:32.369 --> 01:15:34.632
you can do anything,

01:15:34.667 --> 01:15:37.450
but when you get serious,
you see,

01:15:37.485 --> 01:15:40.199
that's when
you become dangerous.

01:15:40.234 --> 01:15:44.868
Yeah, it kind of went, like,
* You bled my mama *

01:15:44.903 --> 01:15:47.332
* You bled my papa *

01:15:47.367 --> 01:15:52.033
* But you won't bleed me **

01:15:53.534 --> 01:15:55.499
<i>Good news was,</i>

01:15:55.534 --> 01:15:57.167
<i>Earth, Wind & Fire
came through</i>

01:15:57.202 --> 01:15:59.199
<i>with some of the music.</i>

01:15:59.234 --> 01:16:00.466
<i>We played it against the movie,</i>

01:16:00.501 --> 01:16:03.033
<i>and it worked
like a motherfucker.</i>

01:16:23.901 --> 01:16:25.032
Now!

01:16:25.067 --> 01:16:27.550
* You bled my mama *

01:16:27.585 --> 01:16:30.033
* You bled my papa *

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.701
* Won't bleed me *

01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:37.334
* Won't bleed me **

01:16:37.369 --> 01:16:38.868
Yeah! That's it!

01:16:38.903 --> 01:16:39.833
That is it!

01:16:39.868 --> 01:16:40.866
We got it, baby!

01:16:40.901 --> 01:16:41.901
You know
what you want.

01:16:41.936 --> 01:16:42.866
You niggas going home

01:16:42.901 --> 01:16:44.265
to make some more
of this music.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.350
I need it. I need
all of it right now.

01:16:46.385 --> 01:16:48.400
Time is money.
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:16:48.435 --> 01:16:50.532
Jimmy, whenever
you're ready.

01:16:50.567 --> 01:16:52.267
Speaking of which,
we need some bread, man.

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:53.299
Got it.

01:16:53.334 --> 01:16:54.734
Got to give you
a check, though.

01:16:54.769 --> 01:16:56.300
No problem.

01:16:56.335 --> 01:16:57.767
Okay.

01:16:59.868 --> 01:17:01.998
All right.

01:17:02.033 --> 01:17:03.234
Bring it back to me now.

01:17:03.269 --> 01:17:04.100
Right on.

01:17:07.067 --> 01:17:08.784
That check was $500.

01:17:08.819 --> 01:17:10.726
You ain't got that.

01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:12.599
Get me some coffee.

01:17:12.634 --> 01:17:14.400
Go on.
Get me some coffee.

01:17:37.534 --> 01:17:39.567
* You bled my mama *

01:17:42.167 --> 01:17:43.399
<i>The bad news was</i>

01:17:43.434 --> 01:17:45.267
<i>that with the rental
of the editing room</i>

01:17:45.302 --> 01:17:47.118
<i>and all the money I owed,</i>

01:17:47.153 --> 01:17:49.327

01:17:49.362 --> 01:17:51.466
<i>Time was of the essence.</i>

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:53.100

01:18:04.336 --> 01:18:06.334
<i>Sweetback!</i>

01:18:18.634 --> 01:18:19.901
Yeah.

01:18:21.968 --> 01:18:23.232
I told you,

01:18:23.267 --> 01:18:25.534
I got nothing to pay you with
until I sell this thing.

01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:29.132
Yeah. No, no.

01:18:29.167 --> 01:18:31.601
Uh, I don't know. Two weeks?

01:18:31.636 --> 01:18:32.933
<i>Unacceptable.</i>

01:18:32.968 --> 01:18:34.701
<i>They want it now,
get it?</i>

01:18:34.736 --> 01:18:36.032
Is that a threat?

01:18:36.067 --> 01:18:37.817
<i>Take it any way
you want to.</i>

01:18:37.852 --> 01:18:39.567
Is that a threat, motherfucker?

01:18:39.602 --> 01:18:42.501
Is that a fucking threat?

01:18:49.067 --> 01:18:50.717
<i>Where's Sweetback?
Where is he?</i>

01:18:50.752 --> 01:18:52.367
<i>I don't know
where's Sweetback.</i>

01:18:55.734 --> 01:18:57.067
<i>Where's Sweetback?</i>

01:18:57.102 --> 01:18:58.400
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

01:19:02.501 --> 01:19:04.584
<i>Where's Sweetback?</i>

01:19:04.619 --> 01:19:06.226
<i>Where is he?</i>

01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:07.799
<i>Sweetback!</i>

01:19:07.834 --> 01:19:09.167
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

01:19:14.634 --> 01:19:15.833
Are you okay?

01:19:15.868 --> 01:19:17.033
You all right?

01:19:21.934 --> 01:19:24.098
I'm okay.

01:19:24.133 --> 01:19:26.834
Yeah, get...
Give me some coffee.

01:19:26.869 --> 01:19:29.468
You got to see a doctor.

01:19:29.503 --> 01:19:32.067
Go get me some coffee.

01:19:32.102 --> 01:19:33.666
About your eyes.

01:19:33.701 --> 01:19:35.434
You got to see a doctor.

01:19:35.469 --> 01:19:37.133
Please, Dad.

01:19:43.434 --> 01:19:44.532
Get the man some coffee.

01:19:44.567 --> 01:19:45.767
Go ahead. I'm fine.
Go ahead.

01:19:45.802 --> 01:19:46.984
<i>And that was it...</i>

01:19:47.019 --> 01:19:48.132
Go ahead, I'm fine.

01:19:48.167 --> 01:19:55.065
<i>The first time
my kid ever called me Dad.</i>

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:59.200
You worry about your kids
until they put you in the grave.

01:19:59.235 --> 01:20:01.801
He looked like he needed
a good meal and a good rest.

01:20:01.836 --> 01:20:02.766
Circles under his eyes.

01:20:02.801 --> 01:20:05.467
Melvin had lost a lot of weight.

01:20:05.502 --> 01:20:07.632
He was in trouble, you see,

01:20:07.667 --> 01:20:10.968
because I could see it
in his eyes.

01:20:15.267 --> 01:20:16.934
<i>Things had gotten so bad,</i>

01:20:16.969 --> 01:20:18.566
<i>I had to sell the bike.</i>

01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:20.998
<i>From now,
on we'd be hoofing it.</i>

01:20:21.033 --> 01:20:22.632
<i>I also had to collect
all my debts</i>

01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:25.868
<i>by any motherfucking means
necessary.</i>

01:20:29.334 --> 01:20:30.834
<i>Doctor said
if I didn't rest soon,</i>

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:32.299
<i>I could lose sight
in my left eye.</i>

01:20:32.334 --> 01:20:37.367
<i>Rest wasn't an option,
so I got an eye patch.</i>

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.701
I need the edit list
from yesterday.

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:42.968
Hey, can we talk?

01:20:43.003 --> 01:20:44.065
We just did.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.033
I said I need the edit list
from yesterday.

01:20:49.534 --> 01:20:51.400
I'm quitting.

01:20:53.834 --> 01:20:55.234
What the fuck did you say?

01:20:55.269 --> 01:20:56.199
I have to quit.

01:20:56.234 --> 01:20:57.199
Man, I'm really sorry.

01:20:57.234 --> 01:20:58.434
but I got
this other thing.

01:20:58.469 --> 01:20:59.998
You come in here,

01:21:00.033 --> 01:21:01.701
telling me what the fuck
you going to do?

01:21:03.367 --> 01:21:05.367
But
- You gonna leave this fucking film

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:06.801
when I tell you you can!

01:21:06.836 --> 01:21:08.098
Melvin!

01:21:08.133 --> 01:21:09.365
What the fuck, man?

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.965
We had a deal! We had a deal!

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
You're the only
other motherfucker

01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:12.965
in here besides me

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.365
that knows all these elements!

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.601
If I don't sell this shit
and make some bread soon,

01:21:16.636 --> 01:21:17.901
I'm gonna lose
every fucking thing!

01:21:17.936 --> 01:21:20.667
You got it?

01:21:22.501 --> 01:21:24.867
* You bled my mama *

01:21:24.902 --> 01:21:27.199
* You bled my papa *

01:21:27.234 --> 01:21:28.599
<i>Things had gotten out of hand,</i>

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:32.667
<i>but somehow I managed
to get the movie done.</i>

01:21:32.702 --> 01:21:37.232
<i>All 97 minutes of it.</i>

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:38.866
<i>I was desperate to sell.</i>

01:21:38.901 --> 01:21:40.917
<i>Plan was
to have distributors come</i>

01:21:40.952 --> 01:21:42.899
<i>to a cast and crew screening,</i>

01:21:42.934 --> 01:21:46.567
<i>so the buyers would see it
with an enthusiastic audience.</i>

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:49.634
You know, T,
the Temptations called.

01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:51.165
They want their suit back.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.267
<i>I'd have to put on
my best game face.</i>

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.701
<i>Never let the buyers
see you bleed.</i>

01:21:56.736 --> 01:21:57.833
Action.

01:21:57.868 --> 01:22:00.534
No, we have not
seen Sweetback.

01:22:00.569 --> 01:22:03.933
And cut.

01:22:03.968 --> 01:22:05.567
The apple don't fall
far from the tree,

01:22:05.602 --> 01:22:06.532
does it?

01:22:06.567 --> 01:22:08.217
Ah, you're so right.

01:22:08.252 --> 01:22:09.833
<i>Comes a point</i>

01:22:09.868 --> 01:22:12.751
<i>where you got
to let the kids go,</i>

01:22:12.786 --> 01:22:15.634
and just be supportive of them.

01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:17.232
<i>This was a movie</i>

01:22:17.267 --> 01:22:20.133
by the brothers
for the brothers

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:21.734
about the brothers,

01:22:21.769 --> 01:22:24.568
and you know what?

01:22:24.603 --> 01:22:27.332
We're all brothers.

01:22:27.367 --> 01:22:29.683
They didn't even invite me
to the cast and crew screening.

01:22:29.718 --> 01:22:32.000
Do you believe that shit?
It's not like I would have gone.

01:22:32.035 --> 01:22:33.601
I mean, who the fuck am I?
Blame-a-Nigga?

01:22:33.636 --> 01:22:35.367
Like everything bad
that happened

01:22:35.402 --> 01:22:36.918
is Clyde's fault.

01:22:36.953 --> 01:22:38.399
Motherfucker.

01:22:38.434 --> 01:22:39.667
And that Bill Harris,

01:22:39.702 --> 01:22:40.866
<i>that white boy,</i>

01:22:40.901 --> 01:22:42.300
<i>with all that peace and love
bullshit,</i>

01:22:42.335 --> 01:22:43.699
<i>now, that was one honky</i>

01:22:43.734 --> 01:22:45.734
that was out to get me
from the very beginning.

01:22:45.769 --> 01:22:47.132
I knew it. I could feel it.

01:22:47.167 --> 01:22:49.634
I was supposed to have the lead
in this motherf-fucking movie,

01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:52.534
but I had two f-fucking lines.

01:22:52.569 --> 01:22:54.735
Well, it was very uncomfortable.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.901
To be honest,
I didn't feel safe.

01:22:56.936 --> 01:22:57.965
It was embarrassing.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.200
The distributors were
tripping over themselves

01:22:59.235 --> 01:23:00.365
to get out of the theater.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.466
What can I say?
Listen, we like Mel.

01:23:02.501 --> 01:23:04.167
Oh, well, we both do.
That's not the point.

01:23:04.202 --> 01:23:05.868
It's just... the movie
wasn't entertaining...

01:23:05.903 --> 01:23:07.535
and who wants to see
something like that?

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:09.168
First thing is,
when you make a movie,

01:23:09.203 --> 01:23:10.732
you have to know
who your audience is

01:23:10.767 --> 01:23:12.334
and that's a lesson
Mel completely forgot,

01:23:12.369 --> 01:23:14.000
went completely
out of his head.

01:23:14.035 --> 01:23:14.965
Very sad.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.200
There's the guy
from Stax Records.

01:23:16.235 --> 01:23:17.499
He says
the album's ready.

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:19.334
Just wants to know
when the movie's coming out.

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:20.951
Well, tell him
to give me some vinyl

01:23:20.986 --> 01:23:22.534
and I'll let him know
when we know.

01:23:22.569 --> 01:23:23.499
Okay?
Hey, brother.

01:23:23.534 --> 01:23:24.901
Man, it's beautiful,
beautiful.

01:23:24.936 --> 01:23:26.801
Congratulations.

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:28.318
Thank you, baby.

01:23:28.353 --> 01:23:29.801
You're welcome.

01:23:29.836 --> 01:23:32.199
Bill. Hey.

01:23:32.234 --> 01:23:33.232
What's happening?

01:23:33.267 --> 01:23:35.799
Let me borrow him
for one second.

01:23:35.834 --> 01:23:37.434
So what do the fucking
the distributors think?

01:23:37.469 --> 01:23:38.399
I don't know, man.

01:23:38.434 --> 01:23:39.434
They split
halfway through.

01:23:39.469 --> 01:23:40.532
One guy left his card.

01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:42.701
I don't even know them.
Cinemation?

01:23:42.736 --> 01:23:43.732
Wait, wait,

01:23:43.767 --> 01:23:45.167
what about the guy
from Spotlight?

01:23:45.202 --> 01:23:46.901
Yeah, he says,
once you get it rated,

01:23:46.936 --> 01:23:48.601
if it gets nothing
harder than an R,

01:23:48.636 --> 01:23:49.632
then he'll screen it.

01:23:49.667 --> 01:23:51.067
Melvin,
we're going to have to run,

01:23:51.102 --> 01:23:52.432
so I just want
to congratulate you

01:23:52.467 --> 01:23:54.467
and tell you
a lot of hard work up there.

01:23:54.502 --> 01:23:55.432
Good.

01:23:55.467 --> 01:23:57.934
Who would believe
this bullshit artist?

01:23:57.969 --> 01:23:58.998
Come on, come on.

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:01.033
What did you really think?

01:24:01.068 --> 01:24:03.899
Honestly?

01:24:03.934 --> 01:24:06.365
You know, uh, it's... it's...

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.965
it's a dangerous film.
What can I say?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.200
But it's not dangerous
when John Wayne has the gun.

01:24:10.235 --> 01:24:13.367
See, most of America
looks like John Wayne,

01:24:13.402 --> 01:24:15.001
so I'm just a little nervous

01:24:15.036 --> 01:24:16.601
people aren't going to be able

01:24:16.636 --> 01:24:18.332
to identify with it.

01:24:18.367 --> 01:24:20.167
I don't know. I always
identified with the Indians.

01:24:20.202 --> 01:24:21.718
You know what?
I don't know anything,

01:24:21.753 --> 01:24:23.234
so leave me out of it,
all right?

01:24:23.269 --> 01:24:24.299
When's it rated?

01:24:24.334 --> 01:24:25.499
When and if I submit it.

01:24:25.534 --> 01:24:26.899
Okay, Melvin, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:24:26.934 --> 01:24:29.133
You had the whole porn thing
that worked with the unions,

01:24:29.168 --> 01:24:30.432
but the ratings board,

01:24:30.467 --> 01:24:32.467
they're just gonna want
to cut out a few tits,

01:24:32.502 --> 01:24:33.432
they're gonna want

01:24:33.467 --> 01:24:35.133
to get rid
of a few swear words.

01:24:35.168 --> 01:24:36.299
Just get your R and go.

01:24:36.334 --> 01:24:37.699
You know what?
It's an all-white jury.

01:24:37.734 --> 01:24:40.734
This board has been doing this
since the year zero.

01:24:40.769 --> 01:24:41.866
Somebody has
to tell parents

01:24:41.901 --> 01:24:43.766
what kids can see,
what they can't see.

01:24:43.801 --> 01:24:46.400
<i>I don't know nothing
about birthing babies!</i>

01:24:46.435 --> 01:24:47.799
<i>It wasn't just the blacks</i>

01:24:47.834 --> 01:24:49.234
<i>who were being portrayed
negatively.</i>

01:24:49.269 --> 01:24:50.751
<i>It was all of us.</i>

01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:52.199
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

01:24:52.234 --> 01:24:54.265
<i>all the Mexicans
who kept saying,</i>

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:56.267
<i>"Badges!
I got no stinking badges!"</i>

01:24:56.302 --> 01:24:58.085
<i>It was the Chinese...</i>

01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.833
<i>You speak to me?</i>

01:24:59.868 --> 01:25:02.868
<i>The Indians, you name it.</i>

01:25:02.903 --> 01:25:04.065
<i>The truth is,</i>

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.234
if you weren't white,
you were the joke.

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:09.599
Only thing is,
we weren't laughing.

01:25:09.634 --> 01:25:11.299
<i>And any white actor
could play us.</i>

01:25:11.334 --> 01:25:14.300
<i>Yellow face, red face,
black face, or brown face.</i>

01:25:14.335 --> 01:25:16.033
<i>Get yourself a feather
or a turban.</i>

01:25:16.068 --> 01:25:17.732
<i>Who said that was okay?</i>

01:25:17.767 --> 01:25:19.232
<i>Making us mammies and butlers,</i>

01:25:19.267 --> 01:25:21.165
<i>kissing Shirley Temple's
little ass.</i>

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.234
<i>Didn't I tell you
to bring this water?</i>

01:25:23.269 --> 01:25:24.332
<i>That's right.
It was you.</i>

01:25:24.367 --> 01:25:25.933
<i>And it fucked up
white kids too,</i>

01:25:25.968 --> 01:25:29.033
<i>because they'd think
that's who we were.</i>

01:25:30.567 --> 01:25:31.933
No all-white jury has the right

01:25:31.968 --> 01:25:34.267
to tell the black community
what it may or may not see.

01:25:34.302 --> 01:25:36.567
Now the rest of you
want to submit to that program,

01:25:36.602 --> 01:25:37.567
that's your business.

01:25:37.602 --> 01:25:38.666
Honestly,

01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:40.100
aren't you doing this
for the press?

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.300
Whose press? Whose press?

01:25:41.335 --> 01:25:42.365
I'm not doing it

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.400
for the white media's
consumption,

01:25:43.435 --> 01:25:44.365
or yours either.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.499
I'm telling the truth, brother.

01:25:45.534 --> 01:25:48.584
You take it
however you want to take it.

01:25:48.619 --> 01:25:51.634
Melvin, you just
bought yourself an X.

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.799
<i>I was hemorrhaging cash,
every day bleeding more.</i>

01:25:55.834 --> 01:26:01.000
<i>Calls for money were constant.
Even death threats now.</i>

01:26:01.035 --> 01:26:02.651
<i>I devised a signal
for the inner circle.</i>

01:26:02.686 --> 01:26:04.267
<i>Ring twice, hang up,
then call back.</i>

01:26:04.302 --> 01:26:05.532
<i>We had, uh...</i>

01:26:05.567 --> 01:26:07.367
<i>We had a couple of calls
about the picture.</i>

01:26:07.402 --> 01:26:08.732
<i>Nothing much,</i>

01:26:08.767 --> 01:26:11.400
<i>but I thought I'd
tell you about it anyway.</i>

01:26:11.435 --> 01:26:14.265
One of them's... they'll...

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:15.567
<i>they'll distribute
Sweetback worldwide,</i>

01:26:15.602 --> 01:26:16.968
but they want their fee up
front,

01:26:17.003 --> 01:26:18.132
and they want

01:26:18.167 --> 01:26:19.968
<i>a 70 percentage
for perpetuity, so-</i>

01:26:20.003 --> 01:26:21.466
We're losing bread.

01:26:21.501 --> 01:26:22.833
<i>I know, I know,
it's ridiculous.</i>

01:26:22.868 --> 01:26:25.067
<i>I don't even want
to think about it.</i>

01:26:25.102 --> 01:26:26.566
Listen, it only gets worse.

01:26:26.601 --> 01:26:29.100
The other one,
it's a very low-ball buyer.

01:26:29.135 --> 01:26:30.567
I'm not going to
insult you with it.

01:26:33.167 --> 01:26:34.683
You ever hear of Cinemation?

01:26:34.718 --> 01:26:36.165
<i>Cinemation? Yeah.</i>

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.567
<i>Yeah, they're a very low-level
distributor</i>

01:26:37.602 --> 01:26:38.833
<i>doing mostly schlock,</i>

01:26:38.868 --> 01:26:40.200
<i>if they're even
still in business.</i>

01:26:43.133 --> 01:26:44.666
<i>Kid, you all right?</i>

01:26:44.701 --> 01:26:46.968
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

01:26:52.334 --> 01:26:53.867
Dad.
Huh?

01:26:53.902 --> 01:26:55.818
The patch.

01:26:55.853 --> 01:26:57.734
Oh, yeah.

01:27:03.133 --> 01:27:04.267
How do I look?

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:05.299
H.N.I.C.

01:27:05.334 --> 01:27:07.067
Head Nigga In Charge?

01:27:07.102 --> 01:27:08.534
Huh.

01:27:11.167 --> 01:27:12.732
So, I got to be honest here.

01:27:12.767 --> 01:27:17.100
What we got
is an X-rated black film

01:27:17.135 --> 01:27:18.866
with no stars.

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:21.968
No Sidney Poitier,
no Diahann Carroll.

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:23.499
In this film,

01:27:23.534 --> 01:27:25.334
a black hustler
beats up two white cops,

01:27:25.369 --> 01:27:27.135
screws a white chick,

01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:28.866
and gets away with it.

01:27:28.901 --> 01:27:30.667
Black folks are gonna
fucking love it, Jerry.

01:27:30.702 --> 01:27:31.866
They're gonna love it.

01:27:31.901 --> 01:27:33.367
Black folks don't own theaters
in America.

01:27:33.402 --> 01:27:35.200
Old white guys do.

01:27:36.934 --> 01:27:38.499
<i>On Watermelon Man,
we had a nice opening.</i>

01:27:38.534 --> 01:27:42.868
<i>Sweetback has gotta open big.
You with me? Bam!</i>

01:27:42.903 --> 01:27:44.267
How many theaters
can you get me?

01:27:44.302 --> 01:27:46.101
Two if we're lucky.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.866
Just two in L.A.?

01:27:47.901 --> 01:27:49.968
Two in the U.S. of A,
my friend.

01:27:50.003 --> 01:27:52.165
The second's in Atlanta.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.601
The first in Detroit,
the Grand Circus.

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:55.868
It's run by the Goldberg twins.

01:27:57.467 --> 01:28:00.167
Believe me, I begged.

01:28:00.202 --> 01:28:01.299
I want to get us

01:28:01.334 --> 01:28:03.750
in as many theaters
as possible.

01:28:03.785 --> 01:28:06.167
My money is where your money is,

01:28:06.202 --> 01:28:08.585
and even if they run it,

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.933
they're gonna play it safe.

01:28:10.968 --> 01:28:12.901
They're gonna sandwich it
between two other flicks.

01:28:12.936 --> 01:28:15.165
Only two theaters
in all of America,

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.734
and it won't even run alone,
not even first run.

01:28:17.769 --> 01:28:20.818
They don't run X-rated films,
Melvin.

01:28:20.853 --> 01:28:23.868
You know you can't even
print the title?

01:28:23.903 --> 01:28:25.335
<i>Sweet Sweetback's</i>

01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:26.732
<i>Baadasssss Song?</i>

01:28:26.767 --> 01:28:28.866
You can't put it
in the newspapers.

01:28:28.901 --> 01:28:33.434
You can't even put it
up on the marquee.

01:28:37.267 --> 01:28:38.567
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:28:43.934 --> 01:28:47.232
No peeking.

01:28:47.267 --> 01:28:48.834
All right, open up.

01:28:52.801 --> 01:28:54.532
What you got there?

01:28:54.567 --> 01:28:56.967
For finishing
your movie.

01:28:57.002 --> 01:28:59.367
Congratulations, honey.

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.866
What's wrong?

01:29:06.901 --> 01:29:08.767
I still got to pick out
a still photo

01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:10.799
for the poster.

01:29:10.834 --> 01:29:15.734
I can't even see straight.

01:29:15.769 --> 01:29:18.732
Okay.

01:29:18.767 --> 01:29:20.699
Okay, honey.

01:29:20.734 --> 01:29:23.400
Listen, go to bed,
rest your eye,

01:29:23.435 --> 01:29:24.934
and I'll help you
with that.

01:29:24.969 --> 01:29:26.367
I'll take care of it.

01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:32.267
Congratu-fucking-lations.

01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:44.567
Fuck!

01:30:16.534 --> 01:30:19.132
All right,
I'll do this fucking deal.

01:30:19.167 --> 01:30:21.567
I just want to meet these guys
that run this theater.

01:30:21.602 --> 01:30:22.766
Absolutely not.

01:30:22.801 --> 01:30:24.501
You'll fuck it up for us.

01:30:24.536 --> 01:30:25.532
Come on, man.

01:30:25.567 --> 01:30:27.332
They're premiering my movie.

01:30:27.367 --> 01:30:33.033
All right,
go charm the shit out of them.

01:30:35.601 --> 01:30:37.566
Look, do us a favor, okay?

01:30:37.601 --> 01:30:40.834
Why don't you take a shave,
put on a suit?

01:30:40.869 --> 01:30:42.501
These guys are
very sharp dressers,

01:30:42.536 --> 01:30:43.998
you understand?

01:30:44.033 --> 01:30:45.766
All right, here's
where you're going.

01:30:45.801 --> 01:30:47.434
<i>To say that this
is self indulgent</i>

01:30:47.469 --> 01:30:49.334
to make this movie,

01:30:49.369 --> 01:30:50.868
that's too good.

01:30:50.903 --> 01:30:52.332
The thing is,

01:30:52.367 --> 01:30:53.965
if you want to make
political statements,

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.567
you can't be concerned
about box office as well.

01:30:56.602 --> 01:30:58.065
We were so busy talking shit

01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.965
about bringing a message
to the people,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.200
we never stopped to bother
whether the people gave a shit

01:31:03.235 --> 01:31:05.784
about the message
we were bringing to them.

01:31:05.819 --> 01:31:08.334
We were just wondering
if they would come.

01:31:15.467 --> 01:31:17.684
Fernando!

01:31:17.719 --> 01:31:19.866
Hello.

01:31:19.901 --> 01:31:21.300
Look at what you're doing,
will you?

01:31:21.335 --> 01:31:22.499
Excuse me.

01:31:22.534 --> 01:31:24.300
The show don't start
till 2:00.

01:31:24.335 --> 01:31:26.265
Fernando, I told you,

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.933
just copy off
the damn poster!

01:31:28.968 --> 01:31:31.567
It's Zombie with a Z,
not an S.

01:31:31.602 --> 01:31:32.965
I'm Melvin Van Peebles.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.383
You're premiering
my movie.

01:31:34.418 --> 01:31:35.732
The box office
ain't open yet.

01:31:35.767 --> 01:31:37.167
Uh, you must be
Mr. Goldberg, correct?

01:31:37.202 --> 01:31:39.232
Yeah.

01:31:39.267 --> 01:31:40.600
I'm Melvin Van Peebles.

01:31:40.635 --> 01:31:41.899
I'm the producer-director

01:31:41.934 --> 01:31:43.133
<i>of Sweet Sweetback's
Baadasssss Song,</i>

01:31:43.168 --> 01:31:44.599
This is my son, Mario.

01:31:44.634 --> 01:31:47.400
Can we take a look
at your theater?

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.501
Hold on a second.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:52.365
Okay.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.983
All right, Ethel,
tell Manny I want to see him,

01:31:55.018 --> 01:31:57.567
<i>and get rid of this
crazy fucking shrasse, okay?</i>

01:31:57.602 --> 01:31:59.484
Yeah.
See you.

01:31:59.519 --> 01:32:01.332
That's him.

01:32:01.367 --> 01:32:03.332
Some wild movie.

01:32:03.367 --> 01:32:05.134
<i>You really schtupping
those girls?</i>

01:32:05.169 --> 01:32:06.901
What movie?
What fucking movie?

01:32:06.936 --> 01:32:09.300
Hey, hey, you eat it,

01:32:09.335 --> 01:32:10.699
you pay for it.

01:32:10.734 --> 01:32:13.299
Right there.
Triple feature.

01:32:13.334 --> 01:32:14.601
<i>Desert Killers,
40-Foot Woman,</i>

01:32:14.636 --> 01:32:15.833
<i>Sweetback's
Baadasssss Song.</i>

01:32:15.868 --> 01:32:17.067
Now, now, listen.
Don't short-change yourself

01:32:17.102 --> 01:32:18.834
by playing it
as a triple feature, man.

01:32:18.869 --> 01:32:21.232
Kid,

01:32:21.267 --> 01:32:22.667
when white people lived
in this neighborhood,

01:32:22.702 --> 01:32:24.301
we got first-run flicks.

01:32:24.336 --> 01:32:25.866
Now we got a half-empty barn

01:32:25.901 --> 01:32:28.265
playing second-run
triple features,

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.501
because your people want
a lot of movie for their buck.

01:32:30.536 --> 01:32:31.632
Of course they do,

01:32:31.667 --> 01:32:33.432
but you're not giving them
a lot of movie.

01:32:33.467 --> 01:32:35.300
You're giving them
second-rate B stuff that's...

01:32:35.335 --> 01:32:37.151
that's got nothing to do
with their lives.

01:32:37.186 --> 01:32:38.968
Melvin, I saw the movie,
and I don't think-

01:32:39.003 --> 01:32:40.466
Manny,

01:32:40.501 --> 01:32:41.732
no offense,

01:32:41.767 --> 01:32:43.133
but you guys
aren't the audience.

01:32:43.168 --> 01:32:44.866
Hey, son.

01:32:44.901 --> 01:32:45.901
Excuse me for a second.

01:32:45.936 --> 01:32:47.468
What did you get?

01:32:47.503 --> 01:32:48.965
3,200 seats total.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.467
The balcony's been closed
for years.

01:32:51.502 --> 01:32:52.701
2,062 seats working,

01:32:52.736 --> 01:32:54.035
a dollar a ticket,

01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:55.334
three shows a day.

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:56.299
Look, kid,

01:32:56.334 --> 01:32:57.734
even if we ran
your movie alone,

01:32:57.769 --> 01:32:59.432
it's rated X.

01:32:59.467 --> 01:33:02.267
Reputable newspapers
won't run X-rated ads.

01:33:02.302 --> 01:33:05.067
How's anyone going to
know it's playing?

01:33:05.102 --> 01:33:08.334
Early to bed.
Early to rise.

01:33:08.369 --> 01:33:10.334
Work like a dog, and...

01:33:10.369 --> 01:33:12.299
advertise.

01:33:12.334 --> 01:33:16.634
<i>Sweetback soundtrack
and T-shirt.</i>

01:33:17.534 --> 01:33:18.499
A record?

01:33:18.534 --> 01:33:20.332
We don't sell records.

01:33:20.367 --> 01:33:22.265
<i>This is a Sweetback
soundtrack.</i>

01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:24.334
I'm gonna be all over
the local radio station

01:33:24.369 --> 01:33:26.118
to play this soundtrack,

01:33:26.153 --> 01:33:27.833
wear that
fucking t-shirt,

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:29.098
and talk about
the world premiere

01:33:29.133 --> 01:33:30.634
<i>of Sweet Sweetback's
Baadasssss Song</i>

01:33:30.669 --> 01:33:31.732
right here,

01:33:31.767 --> 01:33:33.883
at Goldberg's spectacular

01:33:33.918 --> 01:33:35.965
Grand Circus Theater.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.834
It's still got to be
a triple feature.

01:33:37.869 --> 01:33:39.868
I'll make you a bet.

01:33:39.903 --> 01:33:41.051
I'll bet you

01:33:41.086 --> 01:33:42.165
a brand new suit

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.434
<i>that if you run
Sweetback alone,</i>

01:33:43.469 --> 01:33:44.833
the way it should be,

01:33:44.868 --> 01:33:46.267
you'll make more money
in one day

01:33:46.302 --> 01:33:48.635
than you did all last week.

01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:50.968
Chutzpah,
this fucking kid.

01:33:51.003 --> 01:33:52.032
A suit?

01:33:52.067 --> 01:33:53.968
Three pieces,
our tailor?

01:33:54.003 --> 01:33:55.365
Your tailor.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.783
There's two of us.

01:33:56.818 --> 01:33:58.132
And one of me.

01:33:58.167 --> 01:34:01.267
If I lose, I lose double.

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:04.367
* They bled your mama *

01:34:04.402 --> 01:34:05.599
* Won't bleed me *

01:34:05.634 --> 01:34:09.232
* They bled your papa *

01:34:09.267 --> 01:34:10.868
* Your mama
And your sister too *

01:34:16.133 --> 01:34:17.934
<i>Hey, Detroit, this is
the main man,</i>

01:34:17.969 --> 01:34:19.032
<i>J.J. Davis,</i>

01:34:19.067 --> 01:34:20.065
right here at KLST,

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.767
and we're here
in the studio

01:34:21.802 --> 01:34:23.868
with Mr. Melvin
Van Peebles,

01:34:23.903 --> 01:34:25.899
the soul brother
of cinema.

01:34:25.934 --> 01:34:27.701
We're taking calls
for Mr. Van Peebles.

01:34:27.736 --> 01:34:30.132
KLST. Rap on.

01:34:30.167 --> 01:34:31.132
<i>Mr. Van Peebles,</i>

01:34:31.167 --> 01:34:32.567
<i>are you gonna be
in the theater</i>

01:34:32.602 --> 01:34:33.599
<i>in person tonight?</i>

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:35.334
That depends, girl.
Are you on the pill?

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:36.466
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:34:36.501 --> 01:34:39.732
<i>KLST.
Rap on, brother.</i>

01:34:39.767 --> 01:34:41.434
<i>Hey, I seen your comedy
Watermelon Man</i>

01:34:41.469 --> 01:34:42.933
<i>with Godfrey Cambridge, man.</i>

01:34:42.968 --> 01:34:44.767
<i>Does Sweetback
have any stars in it?</i>

01:34:44.802 --> 01:34:46.165
Yeah, you, me...

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.467
<i>The black community.
We're the star, brother.</i>

01:34:48.502 --> 01:34:49.666
<i>Oh, shit,</i>

01:34:49.701 --> 01:34:51.767
<i>I look out my window
and see that for free.</i>

01:34:51.802 --> 01:34:53.699
Not on the big screen,
brother.

01:34:53.734 --> 01:34:57.367
<i>Sweetback opens tomorrow
at the Grand Circus.</i>

01:34:57.402 --> 01:34:59.132
<i>Where else?</i>

01:34:59.167 --> 01:35:00.567
<i>Right here in Detroit,
Grand Circus Theater,</i>

01:35:00.602 --> 01:35:02.467
<i>world premiere.</i>

01:35:04.567 --> 01:35:07.098
What y'all showing?

01:35:07.133 --> 01:35:10.367
First-run movie, brand new.

01:35:10.402 --> 01:35:11.933
<i>Sweetback's.</i>

01:35:11.968 --> 01:35:13.167
What else
shows with it?

01:35:13.202 --> 01:35:14.265
Nothing.

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.065
Nothing?
For a dollar?

01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.701
Let's go over
to the Greek Theater.

01:35:18.736 --> 01:35:21.000
These people
are tripping.

01:35:37.234 --> 01:35:39.968
Can't keep
forgetting to eat.

01:35:40.003 --> 01:35:41.634
You hungry?

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:43.098
Yeah.

01:35:43.133 --> 01:35:45.700
Go get some food.

01:35:45.735 --> 01:35:48.267
Here. Here you go.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.067
You don't want anything?

01:35:51.102 --> 01:35:53.367
I'm fine. Go ahead.

01:36:18.434 --> 01:36:20.632
<i>* Oh *</i>

01:36:20.667 --> 01:36:23.100
<i>* Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo *</i>

01:36:23.135 --> 01:36:24.432
<i>You've got a...</i>

01:36:24.467 --> 01:36:27.567
<i>You've got a... sweet back.</i>

01:36:40.567 --> 01:36:41.933
<i>Mm.</i>

01:36:41.968 --> 01:36:43.567
<i>Sir, I think we've
discovered the weapon</i>

01:36:43.602 --> 01:36:44.567
<i>on one
of the assailants.</i>

01:36:44.602 --> 01:36:45.532
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:36:45.567 --> 01:36:46.766
<i>Sweetback.
Yeah.</i>

01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:48.400
<i>We have
a new development in the case.</i>

01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:50.068
<i>Wash your car,
mister?</i>

01:36:50.103 --> 01:36:51.666
<i>Get away from here.</i>

01:36:51.701 --> 01:36:53.232
<i>No charge
if you don't like it.</i>

01:36:53.267 --> 01:36:55.199
<i>Yeah, no charge
if you don't like it.</i>

01:36:55.234 --> 01:36:58.167
<i>Too bad the witness has
injured himself in a fall.</i>

01:36:58.202 --> 01:37:00.332
<i>Okay.</i>

01:37:00.367 --> 01:37:01.432
<i>Right, sir.</i>

01:37:01.467 --> 01:37:02.766
<i>Commissioner says</i>

01:37:02.801 --> 01:37:04.217
<i>get the information out
on the nigger</i>

01:37:04.252 --> 01:37:05.634
<i>before we get into the station.</i>

01:37:27.667 --> 01:37:30.732
<i>Well?</i>

01:37:30.767 --> 01:37:35.934
Oh, Lord.
Let's go.

01:37:35.969 --> 01:37:37.501
Mm-mm-mm.

01:37:48.367 --> 01:37:49.934
I mean, it's gotta be
something funny,

01:37:49.969 --> 01:37:51.466
because they want
something funny.

01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:53.534
<i>You sure you know
what you gettin' into</i>

01:37:53.569 --> 01:37:55.567
<i>with this whole
independent stuff?</i>

01:37:58.801 --> 01:38:01.400
Average hustler
turns revolutionary.

01:38:01.435 --> 01:38:03.634
Another comedy?

01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:05.799
Serious as cancer.

01:38:05.834 --> 01:38:07.265
Who's gonna want to see that?

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.834
<i>Who's gonna see that?
Who's gonna see that?</i>

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:30.299
Well?

01:38:30.334 --> 01:38:32.934
They'll show.

01:38:32.969 --> 01:38:35.499
They'd better.

01:38:35.534 --> 01:38:38.965
It's 15 minutes
till the 7:00 show.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.234
If your soul brothers
don't show by then,

01:38:42.269 --> 01:38:43.666
we have to cut
our losses

01:38:43.701 --> 01:38:45.567
and switch
to the other movies

01:38:45.602 --> 01:38:48.367
while we still can.

01:39:04.767 --> 01:39:08.050
Eagles ain't nothin'
but a bird.

01:39:08.085 --> 01:39:11.334
White man ain't nothin'
but a turd.

01:39:11.369 --> 01:39:13.901
Niggas ain't shit.

01:39:13.936 --> 01:39:15.866
Fuck you.

01:39:15.901 --> 01:39:18.133
No, you fucked us.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.899
Change the marquee.

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:35.834
<i>Switch to Zombies
and 40-Foot Woman,</i>

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:36.901
<i>rápido!</i>

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:09.234
All right, all right.

01:40:12.467 --> 01:40:15.834
<i>Hello, five for Sweetback.</i>

01:40:15.869 --> 01:40:16.933
Oh, I- I'm sorry.

01:40:16.968 --> 01:40:18.601
We're not playing
that one anymore.

01:40:18.636 --> 01:40:19.866
I can give you tickets

01:40:19.901 --> 01:40:22.934
<i>to 40-Foot Woman
and Killer Zombie.</i>

01:40:22.969 --> 01:40:25.968
Well, the the marquee
says "Sweetback. "

01:40:26.003 --> 01:40:27.065
You got a problem?

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.265
Well, I sure hope not,

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.067
because we drove
a long-ass way

01:40:30.102 --> 01:40:30.934
<i>to see Sweetback.</i>

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:37.133
Customer's
always right, Ethel.

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.200
Hi, sweetie.

01:40:43.235 --> 01:40:44.165
Hi.

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.567
Where's Daddy?

01:40:45.602 --> 01:40:46.934
I don't know.

01:40:46.969 --> 01:40:48.268
Hey.

01:40:48.303 --> 01:40:49.567
J.T.

01:41:09.834 --> 01:41:12.032
Look, Manny.

01:41:12.067 --> 01:41:13.666
We've got a problem.

01:41:13.701 --> 01:41:15.667
There was this guy-
he was in here before-

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:17.299
acting suspicious.

01:41:17.334 --> 01:41:21.100
Gang members, more of them
keep gathering.

01:41:21.135 --> 01:41:23.000
They're up to something.
I know it.

01:41:26.133 --> 01:41:28.834
Black Panthers.
What do they want?

01:41:28.869 --> 01:41:30.251
Get Melvin.

01:41:30.286 --> 01:41:31.599
He left.

01:41:31.634 --> 01:41:33.968
We don't
give refunds.

01:41:34.003 --> 01:41:35.467
That's our policy.

01:41:38.033 --> 01:41:39.601
Give him his refund, Ethel.

01:41:41.767 --> 01:41:44.634
No, lady, I wanna buy
some tickets.

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:49.934
Yes, sir. Uh-
How many?

01:41:49.969 --> 01:41:51.501
Twenty-two.

01:41:51.536 --> 01:41:53.218
Twenty-three.

01:41:53.253 --> 01:41:54.901
Make it 23.

01:42:18.234 --> 01:42:19.998
Manny...

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:22.033
you're never gonna believe this.

01:42:22.068 --> 01:42:24.300
Outside.

01:42:26.767 --> 01:42:29.632
Oh, my God.

01:42:29.667 --> 01:42:30.834
Will you look at that?

01:42:35.033 --> 01:42:36.716
Morty.

01:42:36.751 --> 01:42:38.365
Come here.

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.467
You ain't from around here.

01:42:44.234 --> 01:42:45.534
L.A.

01:42:48.033 --> 01:42:50.801
Long way to come
for a drink.

01:42:53.167 --> 01:42:54.400
Yeah.

01:42:55.667 --> 01:42:57.133
What the fuck are they showing?

01:43:05.868 --> 01:43:08.167
We're getting more, sir.
It'll be just one minute.

01:43:08.202 --> 01:43:09.432
We're sold out.

01:43:09.467 --> 01:43:12.199
Like hell we are.
We'll open the balcony.

01:43:12.234 --> 01:43:15.467
We're out of popcorn,
and there's no hot dogs left.

01:43:15.502 --> 01:43:16.866
I'll take over the stand.

01:43:16.901 --> 01:43:18.265
You go down to the Greek Theater.

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:21.367
Buy whatever they got.
Fernando can help you carry it.

01:43:21.402 --> 01:43:22.934
Don't slop up my Caddy.

01:43:22.969 --> 01:43:23.933
Hot dogs too?

01:43:23.968 --> 01:43:25.384
Don't they have to be Kosher?

01:43:25.419 --> 01:43:27.359
We're not eating them, schmuck.

01:43:27.394 --> 01:43:29.300
We're just selling them. Now go.

01:43:36.033 --> 01:43:37.265
Told you, man.

01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.033
I told you it'd be bad, man.

01:43:39.068 --> 01:43:40.968
Shut up man.
Shut up.

01:43:41.003 --> 01:43:42.868
<i>* They bled your mama *</i>

01:43:42.903 --> 01:43:44.518
<i>Won't bleed me!</i>

01:43:44.553 --> 01:43:46.098
Go, baby!

01:43:46.133 --> 01:43:48.167
<i>He's got to get
to the border.</i>

01:43:48.202 --> 01:43:50.199
<i>You see him?</i>

01:43:50.234 --> 01:43:51.334
They're coming,
Sweetback.

01:43:51.369 --> 01:43:52.299
Run, Sweetback.

01:43:52.334 --> 01:43:54.234
Run motherfucker, run.

01:44:10.367 --> 01:44:12.200
Down in front!

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.965
<i>Look, he's getting away.
He's getting away.</i>

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.868
<i>We've gotta get him
before he gets to the border.</i>

01:44:28.267 --> 01:44:29.833
<i>The man knows
everything, Sweetback.</i>

01:44:29.868 --> 01:44:32.834
<i>Then he oughta know
what's coming to him</i>

01:44:32.869 --> 01:44:34.868
<i>for fucking with me.</i>

01:44:54.334 --> 01:44:55.466
<i>Well...</i>

01:44:55.501 --> 01:44:57.732
<i>Sweet Sweetback's
Baadasssss Song</i>

01:44:57.767 --> 01:45:01.667
<i>became the top grossing
independent hit of 1971.</i>

01:45:01.702 --> 01:45:05.567
<i>Folks started calling me
"Mel Baby" again.</i>

01:45:05.602 --> 01:45:07.901
<i>Cinemation got out
of bankruptcy.</i>

01:45:07.936 --> 01:45:10.199
<i>Bill Cosby got paid back.</i>

01:45:10.234 --> 01:45:12.399
<i>Earth, Wind & Fire
blew up...</i>

01:45:12.434 --> 01:45:14.734
<i>and oh, yeah,
those Goldberg twins-</i>

01:45:14.769 --> 01:45:16.501
<i>They made me that suit.</i>

01:45:22.601 --> 01:45:24.234
I had a little bit of the money,

01:45:24.269 --> 01:45:28.432
and I went to Mrs. Cosby,

01:45:28.467 --> 01:45:32.399
and, uh, she said sure,
and that-

01:45:32.434 --> 01:45:34.566
It was done as far as I was
concerned.

01:45:34.601 --> 01:45:36.800
<i>The first time
I found out about Sweetback</i>

01:45:36.835 --> 01:45:38.965
was one day when I went
to visit Melvin,

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.033
and he came to the door
with a big gun in his hands.

01:45:42.068 --> 01:45:43.434
"Okay, that's enough.
I heard enough.

01:45:43.469 --> 01:45:44.399
Lock him up. "

01:45:44.434 --> 01:45:46.232
Suspected grand larceny

01:45:46.267 --> 01:45:49.601
and impersonating L.A.P.D.
police officers.

01:45:49.636 --> 01:45:52.032
So we spent the weekend in jail.

01:45:52.067 --> 01:45:55.667
So I brought the dildo
back to Melvin,

01:45:55.702 --> 01:45:57.951
and Melvin said, "It's brown. "

01:45:57.986 --> 01:46:00.165
I said "So? What's the big deal?

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.950
He said, "Go back
and get me a black one. "

01:46:02.985 --> 01:46:05.709
And he was almost
like a conductor.

01:46:05.744 --> 01:46:07.905
Melvin would show us clips
of the film

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:10.067
and say, "Okay, this is gonna
go here.

01:46:10.102 --> 01:46:11.451
This is gonna go there. "

01:46:11.486 --> 01:46:13.126
Melvin was the time filler.

01:46:13.161 --> 01:46:14.647
My brother Maurice knew Melvin.

01:46:14.682 --> 01:46:16.098
He was very tight with Melvin,

01:46:16.133 --> 01:46:19.534
so Melvin had this idea
about doing this crazy film.

01:46:19.569 --> 01:46:20.998
The thing I remember most of all

01:46:21.033 --> 01:46:24.133
is that he gave me a check
for $500.

01:46:24.168 --> 01:46:27.201
That check was $500.
You ain't got that.

01:46:27.236 --> 01:46:30.234
That check bounced all over,
all over...

01:46:30.269 --> 01:46:31.699
all over the world, you dig?

01:46:31.734 --> 01:46:34.934
I do remember singing
with Earth, Wind & Fire...

01:46:34.969 --> 01:46:36.534
<i>Wash your car, mister?</i>

01:46:36.569 --> 01:46:38.151
for the soundtrack.

01:46:38.186 --> 01:46:39.699
And my voice is so bad.

01:46:39.734 --> 01:46:41.098
<i>No charge
if you don't like it.</i>

01:46:41.133 --> 01:46:43.133
<i>Yeah. No charge
if you don't like it.</i>

01:46:43.168 --> 01:46:45.098
It was because
of Melvin's commitment

01:46:45.133 --> 01:46:47.734
and Melvin's focus
and his passion about this.

01:46:47.769 --> 01:46:48.933
Nothing was gonna prevent him.

01:46:48.968 --> 01:46:50.567
If he had to die
making this film,

01:46:50.602 --> 01:46:51.899
he would make this film.

01:46:51.934 --> 01:46:55.267
The Panthers... identified
with the part

01:46:55.302 --> 01:46:57.132
that I played as Mu-Mu.

01:46:57.167 --> 01:46:59.065
We had every one of our chapters

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:02.000
mobilize community support
to go see that movie

01:47:02.035 --> 01:47:04.132
because we were so inspired

01:47:04.167 --> 01:47:07.267
by this first revolutionary
piece of cinema.

01:47:07.302 --> 01:47:08.265
Very important film.

01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:10.000
It was a great deal
of solidarity.

01:47:10.035 --> 01:47:11.666
That's what brought us together.

01:47:11.701 --> 01:47:14.300
Hollywood ain't seen nothing
like Melvin, ever before.

01:47:14.335 --> 01:47:18.133
He was a combination
of arrogance, insecurity,

01:47:18.168 --> 01:47:19.666
and boastfulness.

01:47:19.701 --> 01:47:21.632
We've come full circle,

01:47:21.667 --> 01:47:24.400
and some of the things
that were happening

01:47:24.435 --> 01:47:26.065
at that particular time,

01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:29.033
the message that was delivered
in that particular film,

01:47:29.068 --> 01:47:31.234
we're still experiencing
some of that today.

01:47:31.269 --> 01:47:32.566
We supported that film

01:47:32.601 --> 01:47:37.901
to the extent that we put
the film in our newspapers.

01:47:37.936 --> 01:47:41.701
People keep saying,
"Follow your dream,"

01:47:41.736 --> 01:47:43.299
and I say, "Okay,"

01:47:43.334 --> 01:47:46.801
but I think
there's more to it than that.

01:47:46.836 --> 01:47:50.165
I think follow your dream-

01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.265
the first thing you do
is you wake up.

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:57.701
<i>Shaft, I think, was being
written for a white actor,</i>

01:47:57.736 --> 01:47:59.265
and after "Sweetback,"

01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:01.234
they changed it over
for a black person.

01:48:01.269 --> 01:48:02.232
<i>It was before Shaft.</i>

01:48:02.267 --> 01:48:04.950
<i>It was before, uh...
New Jack City.</i>

01:48:04.985 --> 01:48:07.109
It was- It was really
the prelude

01:48:07.144 --> 01:48:09.199
of all the films
that we see now.

01:48:09.234 --> 01:48:14.033
I think that Melvin Van Peebles
is a wonderful example,

01:48:14.068 --> 01:48:15.632
and not the only example,

01:48:15.667 --> 01:48:18.632
but a wonderful example
of a person

01:48:18.667 --> 01:48:26.501
who had a thought, dreamt,
woke up, did it,

01:48:26.536 --> 01:48:29.365
and it's still good.

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:31.200
* You bled your mama *

01:48:31.235 --> 01:48:33.051
* You bled your papa *

01:48:33.086 --> 01:48:34.868
* But you won't bleed me *

01:48:35.305 --> 01:48:41.296
