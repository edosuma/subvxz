WEBVTT

00:02.040 --> 00:02.240
.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.960
We're back.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.400
Let's fucking do this.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.520
Come on!

00:18.400 --> 00:19.920
More pulling.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.400
More getting mortal.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.160
More fights.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.400
Don't you fucking ever!

00:28.600 --> 00:30.360
Things are about to go crazy.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.320
It'll just be carnage.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.600
What the hell? It's a boy.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.600
Oh, my God. There's a new boy.

00:40.840 --> 00:41.840
Oh.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.800
Who the...? What the fuck is this?

00:44.880 --> 00:46.680
I'm Chloe.
Aw...

00:46.760 --> 00:49.600
This is exactly what
the Geordie Shore house needed.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.320
I'm like a bull to a red Marnie.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.080
Come on, then.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.800
Fucking drink in me face,
the stupid bitch.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.840
The best thing we can do is leave
and not see the others.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.800
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.040
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.200
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.800
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.960
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.160
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.880
I'm preened to perfection.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.080
I'm colourful and full of mischief.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.920
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.800
I'm gonna make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.560
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:40.040 --> 01:42.800
Last night was
Nathan and Chloe's first night.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.040
It was a nightmare.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.840
All everyone did was fucking argue.
We'll have to make it up to them.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.760
Fucking hell.
Last night was berserk, wasn't it?

01:50.840 --> 01:53.680
Holly and Marnie
was at each other's throats.

01:56.560 --> 02:01.080
I'm totally lost. Why would Charlotte
go absolutely berserk last night?

02:01.160 --> 02:02.280
I don't know.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.840
I literally have no clue
what went on last night.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.440
I'm not gonna lie as well,
I've pissed the bed. It's sopping.

02:09.520 --> 02:13.440
My first morning in the house
and I've fucking pissed the bed.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.560
It's gone over my shoulder,
in my hair and onto the pillow.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.120
What happened last night?
Like, that was madness, that.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.200
Charlotte was out of order.
She attacked us for no reason.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.480
I'm still fuming.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.240
I feel bad
cos that was your first night. No.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.320
I was pissed.
I didn't know what was going on.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.520
I did feel awkward last night. The
argument had nothing to do with me.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.240
What happened with Holly?

02:44.320 --> 02:47.360
Holly was belittling us
when Charlotte attacked us.

02:49.360 --> 02:53.440
I should never have swilled Holly.
When she comes back, I'll apologise.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.640
What the fuck?

02:59.720 --> 03:02.120
I've woke up in my house
with Holly and Kyle.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.600
I don't know
what I'd do without them.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.000
If I'd woke up alone,
I would've had a serious meltdown.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.160
This is my fault. This is my fault.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.480
I think it could possibly be, yeah.
Yeah.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.080
I know why I flipped.

03:16.160 --> 03:21.760
I thought Gary and Marnie were
flirting and I just saw red.Yeah.

03:21.840 --> 03:27.160
Seeing Marnie flirt with Gary just
triggered anger I couldn't control.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.040
They were only dancing.
I did take it over the top.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.240
Yeah.
I need to apologise to Marnie.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.200
Yeah. Well, she fucking owes me
a massive one, like.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.000
Charlotte's gotta do
is apologise to Marnie

03:38.080 --> 03:40.720
and then hopefully Marnie
will apologise to me.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.840
I'm absolutely shitting myself
to go back.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.200
I'm ashamed of what I did last
night. I took it too far this time.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.560
I'm a serious bell-end.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.480
A lot happened last night,

03:56.560 --> 03:59.160
but we've gotta show Nathan
and Chloe a good time.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.680
To make it up,
we're taking them ice skating.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.000
The others haven't got a clue
that I'm mint at ice skating.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.280
I'm gonna blow them all away.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.520
No, watch your head.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.040
While they go on the ice,
I'm gonna put me lush boots on.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.080
They're gonna be impressed.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.720
Ah, shit!

04:29.800 --> 04:32.760
This is so...
I don't wanna do it.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.440
Oh, my God.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.040
I am fucking shit at this.

04:44.680 --> 04:48.040
Nathan's never heard
that "first impressions count".

04:48.120 --> 04:51.840
He pissed himself last night.
Now he's crawling round the ice rink.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.200
This is embarrassing.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.160
Slow down! Why you going so fast
for? Oh, my God, what are you doing?

04:57.240 --> 04:59.200
Where's Chloe?

04:59.280 --> 05:01.920
I can't wait to see the reaction
on their faces.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.440
I'm like Jayne Torvill,
but better looking.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.760
Hi, Chloe.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.480
I'm ready for this.
I'm gonna tear up the ice.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.680
That's radge, that, like.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.200
(laughter)

05:19.280 --> 05:23.720
What the fuck is going on? Chloe is
pure unreal at ice skating.

05:23.800 --> 05:27.840
I'll whack me chopper in the freezer
and get her to do pirouettes on it.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.920
Oh, my God.
(Gaz laughs)

05:30.000 --> 05:32.840
Chloe's gone from not being able
to stand up straight

05:32.920 --> 05:36.640
to this beautiful, graceful swan
on ice. I didn't expect that.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.560
Nee way.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.720
I can tell they're impressed.
I've got a lush presentation.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.760
It's all finally coming together.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.000
The planet that Chloe comes from
is made of ice.

05:49.080 --> 05:53.280
That explains why she can't walk, but
she's gliding round this ice rink.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.480
Chloe, you're so good at it.
Thanks.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.280
I wasn't expecting that.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.600
There we... (laughs)

06:07.680 --> 06:10.080
Ice skating was fucking wicked.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.320
We need to get back to the madhouse
and straighten out all the shit.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.200
We're at the door
and I'm shitting it.

06:22.280 --> 06:26.840
Me heart is beating so fast
it feels like it's gonna explode

06:26.920 --> 06:29.640
and I'll be dead
before I get through the door.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.600
Ah, no-one's in.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.760
Hello?

06:34.840 --> 06:37.040
I just wanna get this over
and done with.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.880
I want everyone to get along

06:45.960 --> 06:49.360
and show Chloe and Nathan how good
it can be in this house.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.240
A lot needs to be sorted out
before that can happen.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.120
Don't worry.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.560
Hello, you alreet?
Oi-oi. Hiya.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.320
We get back and Charlotte, Kyle and
Holly are all in the living area.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.280
It feels so awkward.
I don't know where to look.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.600
The first thing on my mind
is talking to Marnie.

07:16.680 --> 07:21.040
We go to the bedroom and I'm just
hoping that this is gonna go well.

07:21.120 --> 07:25.920
Right, Marnie, I can't even begin
to, like, say how sorry I am.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.240
I really didn't mean
to do that to you.

07:28.320 --> 07:32.240
Not in a million years
would I ever have wanted to hurt you

07:32.320 --> 07:35.240
or do anything like that.
We've been getting on so well.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.040
That's why I was so upset, because
I just didn't know why it happened.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.200
It's so hard trying to explain
to Marnie what happened

07:42.280 --> 07:44.960
when I'm still trying
to work it out in me own head.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.720
I can remember looking at yous

07:46.800 --> 07:51.080
and I got the gauge that you looked
like yous were flirting

07:51.160 --> 07:53.080
and I just saw red, Marnie.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.960
Charlotte is so, so sorry.
It's written all over her face.

07:57.040 --> 08:01.000
It just proves that she isn't in
control over her feelings for Gary.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.800
So we're OK now?
Yeah.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.120
I'm pleased that's sorted.
Me, too.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.520
I've got the important bit
out of the way,

08:08.600 --> 08:11.240
but I still need to apologise
to the house.

08:11.320 --> 08:15.040
I'm sorry, especially to Nathan and
Chloe, cos it was your first night.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.560
Charlotte's apologising
to the group.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.400
I want everyone to get on,

08:19.480 --> 08:22.960
cos I want to have a good night out
that I actually remember.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.600
Shall we do last night again
tonight?Yeah, let's.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.200
We really need to show them
a proper Geordie Shore night out.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.400
We're gonna re-group
and give them a second first night.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.440
Yeah?

08:46.480 --> 08:50.400
So I've apologised to Marnie
and to the rest of the house,

08:50.480 --> 08:52.680
but now I need to speak to Gary.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.360
Ground, swallow me up.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.280
Oh. You all right?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.800
I think it was because
I was so angry,

09:11.880 --> 09:14.640
cos I felt like you and Marnie
were flirting.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.000
In a club I'm gonna dance
with Marnie, with Holly.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.480
I know, and it's not my place
to be angry, but I got angry.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.800
You push all of me buttons, Gary.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.240
I know. I'm not doing it on purpose.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.040
Nothing's more important
than us being friends.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.320
Charlotte's important to me.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.560
We've been through
more than anybody can imagine

09:34.640 --> 09:37.400
and mine and her friendship means
the world to me.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.200
Course you'd say that.No, but I'd
come and sit with you all night.

09:45.280 --> 09:49.280
That's not what I want. This
is why I'm so frustrated by it.

09:49.360 --> 09:53.040
I don't know what you want. If
I'm being too much friends with you.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.400
What do you mean when you say you're
being too much friends with us?

09:57.480 --> 09:59.360
Last time you only got with me.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.680
I know.
That's a bit of a headfuck.

10:01.760 --> 10:06.040
For four years on and off I have
given my everything to Gary.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.440
He's took me heart back and forth

10:08.520 --> 10:12.560
and I've always still been loyal,
and been there waiting for him.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.480
It's different this time,
I can tell. Something has changed.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.520
Last time round, I was single.
I was getting with you.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.800
What's different with this time?

10:23.880 --> 10:26.080
Charlotte's getting upset,
and so am I.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.840
But I feel like
I owe her an explanation.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.640
I... I've met someone else.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.760
Fuck!

10:38.720 --> 10:40.520
Charlotte, I... Come here.

10:44.560 --> 10:49.400
I just...
All of the times in the past

10:49.440 --> 10:52.680
that I've felt like
Gary has broke me heart

10:52.760 --> 10:56.800
doesn't even compare
to how I feel right now.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.160
Char?
Yeah.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.920
The fact... (sniffs)
that he's met someone

11:11.000 --> 11:13.560
and she obviously means
so much to him

11:13.640 --> 11:17.120
that he actually isn't
gonna go near me,

11:17.200 --> 11:22.360
this is the one and only time
me heart has been broken by Gary.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.480
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
not be there.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.360
I just feel like
I was never good enough.

11:31.440 --> 11:36.000
I was always second best. I could
never have been the one for Gary.

11:36.080 --> 11:39.880
I was just someone to pass the time
while he waited for someone else.

11:43.880 --> 11:49.400
We're ready to go out and Charlotte's
ran straight up to the bedroom.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.760
I know something's gone on.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.920
I've never felt so sorry
for anyone more in me life.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.720
I don't know how she keeps
picking herself back up

12:08.800 --> 12:10.720
when Gary keeps knocking her down.

12:10.800 --> 12:11.880
What did he say?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.560
Charlotte is absolutely devastated.

12:21.640 --> 12:27.000
Gary's told her that he's seeing
somebody. What the actual fuck?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.960
I know it's gonna be hard, but you've
got to keep in the back of your mind

12:31.040 --> 12:34.600
you don't wanna be with somebody
like that and you deserve better.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.920
I shouldn't wanna be with someone

12:37.000 --> 12:39.080
who's messed us around
for four years.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.920
But I do and now he's with someone
else, that can never happen.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.760
Tonight we need to concentrate
on showing the newbies

12:55.840 --> 12:57.800
a first good second night. Right?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.320
Let's go, then.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.840
We'll show them how to party
Geordie Shore style.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.360
The last few days have been emotional
and crazy.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.080
Tonight's about everyone having
a wicked night. Let's get mortal.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
You all right?

13:28.200 --> 13:32.640
I still need to explain to Holly why
I swilled her and that I'm so sorry.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.360
Me and Marnie are absolutely fine.
I don't hold grudges.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.040
If she's apologised,
that's good enough for me.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.560
Tonight I'm gonna pace myself.

13:59.640 --> 14:03.400
I'm gonna have a sick night,
but I wanna remember everything.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.040
Do you want a drink?

14:10.120 --> 14:13.200
Nathan is the first bisexual
in the Geordie Shore house.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.320
I wanna know who he prefers,
boys or girls.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.600
For example, Scotty T prefers girls
100% of the time, all the time,

14:20.680 --> 14:22.480
every time. What's the time?

14:43.320 --> 14:44.560
Go on, lad!

14:44.640 --> 14:47.880
Scott's making us choose between
a fit girl and an ugly lad.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.160
I want them both.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.800
I won't lie, I love the attention.
I do fancy Scott a little bit.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.240
Everyone is having so much fun.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.720
This is the night
Chloe and Nathan deserve.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.600
I'm really drunk and all I wanna do
is have a fucking mint time

15:18.680 --> 15:20.000
and dance like a radgie.

15:23.960 --> 15:28.280
Wow. Chloe's dancing is horrific.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.600
She's as bad as an octopus
attempting the robot

15:31.680 --> 15:33.000
on roller blades.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.160
Gaz has got a secret girlfriend.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.560
I can't believe there's actually
a fucking girl out there

15:52.640 --> 15:54.640
who's managed to tame Gary Beadle.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.400
If he manages to stay faithful to
her, I'll fucking eat me own head.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.280
I wanted to tell the lads, but I
couldn't tell them and not Charlotte.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.920
Imagine she heard off somebody else.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.240
That would've been
the worst scenario.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.720
Fuck. I'm actually gonna have
to bring her into this madhouse.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.080
That's scary.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.040
Tonight's been amazing.
The family's back on track.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.960
Let's get back to that house
and keep this party going.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.560
Last night everyone fucked up
Chloe and Nathan's first night.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.440
We're back at the house and it's time
for Geordie Shore initiation.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.960
First game was truth or dare.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.160
What you don't get to choose is
you've got to have a shot.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.960
Chloe, truth or dare?
Dare!

17:11.040 --> 17:13.440
A three-second snog with Aaron.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.080
This is an easy dare.
Aaron is so good-looking.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.240
Whoa.

17:19.320 --> 17:22.640
Since I got this top-knot
everyone wants a piece of us.

17:22.720 --> 17:26.320
Dare.
A three-second bald kiss with Scott.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.560
Bald kiss?

17:27.640 --> 17:30.960
This isn't a dare. It's a treat.
For Scott it is, anyway.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.480
(laughter, cheering)

17:34.560 --> 17:38.080
I'm pure radge, me. You didn't have
to tell me twice. Come on.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.040
(all) Five... four... three... two...

17:41.120 --> 17:44.680
Time for the next game.
As many sex positions in 30 seconds.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.240
Go!

17:48.400 --> 17:50.640
I didn't think Nathan would be
this good.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.560
I'm getting thrown right, left.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.320
My fanny's out. My tits are out.
My leg's up. I cannot even breathe.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.800
(laughter)

18:00.040 --> 18:01.560
What the fuck?

18:02.680 --> 18:05.280
Nathan's now king of the shag pad.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.160
You'd best be taking notes.
I just bossed that.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.040
Nathan's first night in the shag pad
and he broke the bed. What a ledge.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.520
Hang on a second.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.000
Why am I watching
people imitating having sex

18:28.080 --> 18:31.600
when I could be having sex
with Kyle right now?

18:34.080 --> 18:38.200
It's time for me to show Holly
the best 22.5 seconds of her life.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.400
(grunting)

18:47.840 --> 18:51.280
I'm feeling really confident about me
and Kyle at the minute.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.920
I do trust him
and I couldn't be happier.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.160
Next game's in the hot tub.
Lies or truth.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.400
You say one thing, everyone decides
if it's a lie or true.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.160
I sucked Scott off.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.160
True. True.
False. False. False.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.600
True.
False.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.680
Yes! Cos you don't give blowies.
I don't give blowies.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.480
I've had a wank in the shower
over a lad in the house. False.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.600
If he's got any taste I guarantee
it'd be over Scotty fucking T. Whey!

19:21.680 --> 19:22.960
True.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.400
(all cheer)

19:26.480 --> 19:28.320
Games have been amazing.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.040
But I need to get out
of this hot tub and get dry.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.480
Chloe. Chloe.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.040
Chloe. Is that towel dry?

19:37.560 --> 19:38.920
Eh? What?

19:40.520 --> 19:44.000
Oh, my God, Chloe's just been
clothes-lined by a towel.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.800
I'm weeing!

19:49.800 --> 19:53.840
I'm finding it so funny I'm pissing
myself. There's wee everywhere.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.160
Fuck. What a dickhead.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.880
Tonight has been wicked.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.680
I hope the newbies enjoyed it
after we fucked it up last night.

20:11.760 --> 20:15.320
Now it's time to get to bed and get
some sleep. Scotty T, sign out.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.040
Charlotte?
Yeah.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.480
It's affected us.
It's a big, big thing.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.960
What Gary told us last night
is still playing on me mind.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.440
I'm trying not to think about it,
but it's hit us so hard.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.600
It was always Charlotte and Gary
from the beginning.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.680
So it's gonna be difficult.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.840
Couldn't have been easy for him
to hurt you like that.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.720
He does care about you.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.720
There was tears in his eyes.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.280
Gary and Charlotte have always been
each other's property.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.600
Now Charlotte has to deal with him
being somebody else's.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.760
It's difficult.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.360
Hi.
Oi, oi.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.200
Hi.
Can we all gather round?

21:18.280 --> 21:22.760
We're chilling, then Anna rocks up.
Shit. I hope I'm not in trouble.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.520
I thought I'd pop by to see
how Chloe and Nathan are doing.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.000
Fitting in well.
Really well. Good.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.040
You've got your first Tash On Tours
job tonight. Holly.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.960
I want you, Kyle and Scott
to lead the way.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.680
We've got to take Nathan and Chloe
to their first Tash On Tours.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.760
They're learning from the best.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.240
No tashing on with the singles.
Be good.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.800
We will. See you later.
Bye.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.280
I don't know why you tell me
not to neck on with the clients.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.360
It's me necking on
what makes them keep coming back.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.040
Me and Chloe are in the hot tub.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.360
It was a good idea to give her
a wash in case I pole her later.

22:11.240 --> 22:15.440
I've really got on well with Marnie.
I think she's been so nice.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.960
I'm so happy cos I was scared
I wouldn't get on with anyone.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.240
Me and Nathan are fitting in
so well.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.560
Everyone's made us feel so welcome.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.440
Chloe is sound
and we have a history.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.120
I used to get with her.
Who knows what'll happen?

22:37.200 --> 22:41.160
I think I get on with you really,
really well. You're so funny.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.320
I love your facial expressions.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.720
Come! (laughs)

22:45.800 --> 22:49.200
I don't wanna let Scott know
he might have a chance with us.

22:49.280 --> 22:53.320
I play hard to get, but once you've
had a drink, you just cannot.

22:59.720 --> 23:03.800
It's the newbies' first Tash On
Tours. We'll show them how it's done.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.520
You know how Anna said you're not
allowed to neck on, is that true?

23:07.600 --> 23:11.240
Well, to be honest, Chloe, we're
there to show them a good time, so...

23:11.320 --> 23:13.800
Yeah.
If that's how you've gotta do it...

23:13.880 --> 23:17.880
Holly's telling us that I can do
anything I like. I'm dead excited.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.920
We're on our way.
See yous later.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.040
Tonight, me, Holly, Chloe, Kyle and
Nathan are hitting Tash On Tours.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.920
Let's make it a fucking good 'un.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.800
Hi, everyone.
You all right?

23:37.880 --> 23:39.280
(cheering)

23:40.360 --> 23:44.640
First game, introduce yourself and
show us your signature dance move.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.880
I'm Nathan. My signature dance
move's the twerk.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.120
(whoops)

23:49.200 --> 23:50.800
(cheering)

23:50.880 --> 23:52.400
Ooh, you fucker.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.400
(cheering)

24:02.280 --> 24:05.840
I've never wished I was a floor tile
more in my entire life.

24:11.760 --> 24:12.960
What is it, though?

24:13.040 --> 24:15.720
It's called bums...
buns and baps, right?

24:15.800 --> 24:20.160
I'm really nervous. I'm so scared
in case a sausage gets on me dress.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.320
(cheering)

24:35.600 --> 24:39.200
My line won cos of me. I'm great
with a quarter pounder sausage.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.800
It's gonna be such a good night.
Me, Charlotte, Gary and Aaron.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.520
It's like the good old times.
But without the shagging.

24:54.600 --> 24:57.920
It's almost like the old boyfriend
club, isn't it? Oh!

24:58.000 --> 24:59.520
It is.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.600
Better be careful tonight. I might
end up with Gary's cock in me mouth.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.800
That will never happen.
He's got a girlfriend.

25:06.880 --> 25:12.440
Cheers to us for...
being in a really good place now.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.120
(laughter)

25:21.680 --> 25:23.800
The others aren't in the club.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.680
They must still be at work.
Sucks to be them.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.120
That chat with Charlotte was one
of the hardest things I've done.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.720
The fact that I'm in a club,
getting on with her, is amazing.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.160
I'm pissed off and to be honest,

25:54.240 --> 25:57.920
I'm absolutely furious that Gary is
with any other girl but me.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.120
But obviously I can't tell him that.

26:00.200 --> 26:04.120
So as far as he knows,
I'm over the moon for him.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.120
Charlotte's saying that I'm her Gary.
And you were my Charlotte.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.720
Then you got a boyfriend

26:21.800 --> 26:24.560
and I know how hard
and how bad that felt for me.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.920
I do not want you to feel the same.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.440
I know what Charlotte's
going through,

26:41.520 --> 26:44.280
but it does mean so much to me
that she's pissed off,

26:44.360 --> 26:45.920
but she's happy for us.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.240
The fact that we're standing here
hugging means everything.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.840
That's work boxed off.
So let's go fucking aka.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.120
The others have finally turned up,

26:59.200 --> 27:01.560
so it's time
to get this party started

27:01.640 --> 27:04.280
and drink wine
like I'm feeling fine.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.040
I find it strange
talking to Aaron about Dan,

27:25.120 --> 27:29.360
because I do find Aaron attractive
and at one point there was feelings.

27:38.160 --> 27:41.560
Marnie's saying it's weird talking
to me because of Dan.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.320
I thought we were just mates.

27:46.840 --> 27:50.200
Sometimes when I'm talking to Aaron
and he's being so nice,

27:50.280 --> 27:54.200
I feel like I just go back in time
and I forget everything else.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.240
Drinks are getting necked
and everyone's buzzing.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.960
Tonight is fucking epic.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.760
Oh, my God, I can't believe
how mortal we all are.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.200
We're all dancing
like absolute idiots.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.840
It's been a wicked night,
but I can hardly stand up.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.960
I think it's time to go home.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.080
(shouts)

28:45.280 --> 28:49.160
If I wasn't so drunk, I'd probably
be really appreciative of this.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.240
Gary's taking us to bed
and he's tucking us in.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.720
I'm really drunk so I'll pass out.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.040
We've had an amazing night.

29:00.120 --> 29:03.720
Me and Kyle are in bed together.
We're having a cuddle. Perfect.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.960
Nathan needs to realise in the
bedroom, you have banter before bed.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.520
Nah, that's bad. No!

29:15.600 --> 29:19.400
Nathan, I am messing. I would never
do that. Get yourself to sleep, mate.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.480
(buzzes)

29:20.560 --> 29:21.920
(buzzes)

29:22.000 --> 29:24.160
Fuck off now!
(laughter)

29:24.240 --> 29:27.280
What the fuck is that?
I need to protect my brows.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.800
I'm not going to sleep
till you go over there.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.560
(laughs)

29:32.400 --> 29:35.080
Night-night, boys.
Yeah. Night, boys.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.480
Night-night, Nathan.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.800
(buzzing)

29:37.880 --> 29:39.640
Aaron, fuck off.
(laughter)

29:51.640 --> 29:54.080
I've had an epiphany
about me and Gary.

29:54.160 --> 29:58.160
Do you know how I say I want all
or nothing? I'm not gonna do that.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.200
I am gonna be his friend

30:00.280 --> 30:03.880
because that's an adult, mature way
to deal with the situation.

30:03.960 --> 30:07.320
I'll try hard to be Gary's friend.
It's gonna be difficult.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.360
I've got more than friend feelings
for him. But I can do this.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.120
I'm a strong woman.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.080
I'm glad that he's found someone.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.600
I'm not.
No, you're not.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.800
Why am I saying this?
I don't know.

30:18.880 --> 30:22.680
The only thing I'm upset about is
that he's not my Gary any more,

30:22.760 --> 30:25.440
cos he's not. He's just... Gary.

30:25.520 --> 30:30.120
I've gotta let him go, be free, let
him be someone else's Gary for now.

30:30.200 --> 30:34.480
Hopefully that'll end, then he can
be my Gary again, forever and ever,

30:34.560 --> 30:38.840
and we can die together
and be buried in the same tomb.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.520
At first I was so nervous
about coming into the house.

30:45.600 --> 30:49.520
But everyone's been so nice and I
genuinely feel like I'm fitting in.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.640
I thought I wouldn't settle in. I
thought, "What if no-one likes us?"

30:54.800 --> 30:57.240
Probably Scott.
Scott flirts all the time.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.680
I wouldn't mind getting with Scott.
Do you think he's gorgeous?

31:00.760 --> 31:02.160
He is good-looking.
He is.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.000
I do think it's really, really funny
that me and Nathan fancy Scott.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.640
I think I've got the better chance.
Howay, man.

31:08.720 --> 31:12.440
I don't wanna get feelings.
He would flirt with a lamp post.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.720
I can't deal with that.
If you got drunk you'd get with him.

31:15.800 --> 31:19.840
Place your bets, Chloe and Scott
get it on tonight. Guaranteed.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.440
Buck and chuck. (laughs)

31:22.520 --> 31:26.480
I love that name. It reminds us of
the Chuckle Brothers. I love them.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.240
Like, they remind me of myself.
(laughs)

31:33.240 --> 31:36.320
It's me, Kyle, Scott, Chloe
and Marnie at work tonight.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.280
I haven't done a bar crawl for ages.
I'm buzzing.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.720
Kyle's going to work without me
for the first time.

31:43.800 --> 31:47.280
He's got to keep in mind
to be respectful towards my wishes.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.360
I don't want you to play
the ice cube game next to a girl.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.800
Why? You're allowed to play the game
next to a boy.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.440
It's nothing.
No, it's not.

31:55.520 --> 31:59.840
When we're trying to build trust,
I'm not having you necking on.

31:59.920 --> 32:04.560
Holly, unless you give us a chance,
you're never gonna trust us.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.840
I won't do it. It's not necking on,
but I see where you're coming from.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.800
As long Kyle realises he's at work

32:10.880 --> 32:13.480
and he's not the carefree
single lad he once was,

32:13.560 --> 32:15.400
everything will be totally fine.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.840
Howay, yous, let's go.
Calm your knickers, kid.

32:21.920 --> 32:25.360
Fucking buzzing. We're gonna box
this bar crawl clean off.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.120
Hiya, everyone.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.440
We arrive at this lass's
birthday party.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.960
It's full of fit young students.
School's out for fucking Scotty.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.360
You've got to have a shot.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.440
The fantastic four.
Yes. Yes!

32:57.520 --> 32:58.920
(cheering)

33:01.720 --> 33:05.560
We're ready and we're off to Bijoux.
The fab four are out tonight.

33:12.480 --> 33:16.520
We get to Bijoux.
Me and Charlotte are friends.

33:16.600 --> 33:20.040
Nathan's settling in. Have a cheers
to the fantastic four.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.720
Gary's asking if I'm worried
about Kyle at work.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.840
Of course not.
I completely trust him.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.360
Well, not completely,
but I mostly trust him.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.800
Work's going well. We're buzzing
and we're doing the ice cube game.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.360
Put the ice cube in your mouth,
pass it round,

33:48.440 --> 33:51.040
whoever it melts on
downs a full drink.

33:51.120 --> 33:54.760
Shock, Holly's not here and even
though Kyle said he wouldn't,

33:54.840 --> 33:56.960
he's playing
the fucking ice cube game.

33:59.520 --> 34:03.160
Hold on a minute, Kyle's playing it.
Holly is gonna be furious.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.080
Go!
We go?

34:05.160 --> 34:08.760
I look at Kyle's face
and he looks fucking worried.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.800
The kid is gonna be in deep shit.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.120
It's not cheating, it's ice.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.400
Fuck!

34:21.400 --> 34:24.720
Kyle is either mighty brave
or mighty stupid.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.240
Holly is gonna kick off tonight.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.440
Make some noise
for Laura's birthday.

34:29.520 --> 34:33.560
The bar crawl's over so it's party
time. Let's get to Bijoux.

34:38.240 --> 34:41.200
We've knocked back a few
and the workers arrive.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.000
I am dying to know what's happened.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.160
I leave it about five seconds
before I ask Kyle

34:49.240 --> 34:51.840
if he's done anything
inappropriate at work.

34:57.400 --> 35:02.360
Holly asks us, "Did you play the ice
cube game?" I've nothing to hide.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.200
I tell Kyle that I'm not bothered
that he played the ice cube game,

35:12.280 --> 35:13.680
but inside I am boiling.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.320
It is the one thing
that I asked him not to do.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.880
Chloe's looking canny fit tonight.

35:30.960 --> 35:34.760
That bird is going the right way
for a grafting off Scotty T.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.600
Chloe's being full-on
and if she's not careful,

35:46.680 --> 35:50.160
I'm gonna take her for a taster menu
at the house of turbo.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.240
I hope you're fucking peckish, pet.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.600
Me and Marnie
have been flirting a lot.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.160
I wanna know
if she still fancies us.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.160
It feels so natural
to flirt with Aaron.

36:10.240 --> 36:14.560
I get so wrapped up in it
and then I think, "Do I fancy him?"

36:14.640 --> 36:16.240
I don't even know.

36:22.160 --> 36:26.840
I tell Gaz how Kyle played the ice
cube game. He's got away with it.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.760
I can't believe Scott.

36:36.840 --> 36:40.360
Kyle positioned himself in
the ice cube game next to a fit bird.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.400
Holly has been totally mugged off.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.040
(Holly) Fuck!
I can't believe he lied.

37:00.120 --> 37:03.240
What else will he disrespect me over?

37:09.080 --> 37:10.600
I don't know what's going on.

37:10.680 --> 37:15.120
Obviously Holly wasn't OK cos
things are going off here, like.

37:20.440 --> 37:25.000
We're having a pure wicked night
and Holly and Kyle start arguing.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.920
I give you one fucking guess
what this is about.

37:30.120 --> 37:33.680
It's best me and Holly leave
before another argument kicks off.

37:36.560 --> 37:40.080
I can't deal with this any more,
Kyle. What do you want?

37:40.160 --> 37:43.360
What do you mean?
What do you want from me?

37:43.440 --> 37:47.200
Every time I'm upset Kyle moves
further and further away from me.

37:47.280 --> 37:50.440
All I want is comforting
and to know that he likes us.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.920
Sick of this?
Sick of it.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.240
It? Ah, it.
Us. You and me.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.160
Us. Me. You. Everything.
Yeah.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.520
Do you wanna finish it?

37:58.600 --> 38:01.000
I'm so upset and I'm so frustrated

38:01.080 --> 38:04.440
and all I want him to know is
how much I care, and then I say it.

38:04.520 --> 38:07.640
I fucking love you, right?

38:07.720 --> 38:09.640
So fucking chill out.

38:13.080 --> 38:16.520
Nothing. Dead fucking silence.

38:16.600 --> 38:20.280
That is what every girl who tells
a lad she loves him wants to hear.

38:23.880 --> 38:27.880
Holly has just told Kyle that she
loves him for the first time ever

38:27.960 --> 38:30.280
and his response
is to look out the window

38:30.360 --> 38:34.440
like he's never seen Newcastle
before. What a fucking divvy.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.960
(Kyle)I do care about Holly
and like spending time with her.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.920
In this taxi at this time in front
of these people, I don't feel it.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.760
So I'm not gonna say it back.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.680
If you love someone, nothing in the
world will make you hold that back.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.720
(Holly sobs)
You will say it no matter what.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.160
And considering that's the first
time she's said that...

38:58.240 --> 39:02.320
Charlotte, I just wanna get out
the car. Just leave us alone.

39:03.240 --> 39:06.480
This has been the most awkward
taxi I've ever had.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.280
Get me the fuck out of here
and in this house.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.680
I'm absolutely devastated
about what's happened in the taxi

39:20.760 --> 39:22.720
and I don't know how to diffuse it.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.800
You are not going home.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.560
Don't you dare.
No, Holly, no.

39:26.640 --> 39:30.520
Holly's really upset. She's got her
fucking suitcase. She's taking off.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.640
I can't deal with being in this house
any more and I need to leave.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.360
No, I don't, though.
You do, though.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.440
I like Holly.
I'm just not in love yet.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.840
That doesn't
mean I don't wanna be with her.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.120
How has this night gone
from me telling Kyle that I love him

39:52.200 --> 39:56.880
to he saying he can't do this?
This is the worst night of my life.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.600
The difference between me and you,
I'm not willing to say "I love you"

40:00.680 --> 40:04.240
in the middle of a fucking taxi
when I'm drunk. That's not me.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.600
I never expected him to say it back,

40:06.680 --> 40:09.840
but I was just trying
to show how much I cared.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.240
Me and Holly have both realised
that we've got to work harder

40:15.320 --> 40:18.360
if we want this relationship
to work in this house.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.320
I feel bad on Kyle and Holly,

40:24.400 --> 40:27.680
but tonight there's no way
I'm listening to them argue,

40:27.760 --> 40:30.120
so me and Chloe are off
to the buck hut.

40:33.440 --> 40:37.400
The horniness has took over us. All
I wanna do is get freaky with Scott.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.800
Fucking hell.
Chloe's fanny's like a Cheerio.

40:45.880 --> 40:48.640
I'll have to treat meself
to an early breakfast.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.600
(moaning)

40:50.680 --> 40:52.560
(shouts)

40:52.640 --> 40:54.120
Fucking hell.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.760
I put in a good performance.
I'm wiped out.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.600
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.360
There must be
something in the water.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.440
Me and Marnie end up flirting.
This has got to stop.

41:07.520 --> 41:10.000
(laughs) Right, take your top off.

41:10.080 --> 41:13.800
When I'm drunk, I tell Aaron
anything he wants to hear.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.280
I want him to flirt back.

41:15.360 --> 41:18.600
Stop being so fucking perfect.

41:18.680 --> 41:21.240
You make out you're so perfect
when you're not.

41:21.320 --> 41:23.800
I'm not perfect.
I'm far from perfect.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.960
If I'm so perfect, what are you
doing with someone else?

41:27.040 --> 41:28.440
See you later.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
(snores)

41:35.080 --> 41:36.800
(snoring)

42:06.560 --> 42:06.760
.
