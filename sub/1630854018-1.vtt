WEBVTT

00:22.708 --> 00:24.708
[Galadriel]  Nothing is evil
in the beginning.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.791
Here! Over here!

00:25.916 --> 00:29.666
-[stick tapping]
-[children laughing]

00:29.750 --> 00:33.875
[Galadriel]  And there was a time
when the world was so young,

00:33.916 --> 00:36.916
there had not yet been a sunrise.

00:37.041 --> 00:41.375
But even then there was light.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.916
[whispering]

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
[children giggling]

01:03.041 --> 01:05.875
Well, is it finished yet?

01:17.833 --> 01:21.375
Even you couldn't possibly believe
that old scrap will float.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.333
It's not going to float.

01:25.583 --> 01:28.666
It's going to sail.

01:48.666 --> 01:49.750
-Stop!
-[children laughing]

01:50.333 --> 01:51.166
No, don't!

01:52.041 --> 01:54.041
-[grunting]
-Stop, you'll break it!

01:54.125 --> 01:56.083
Stop! Don't!

01:56.166 --> 01:58.500
-Come on.
-Stop, you're breaking it! Stop!

02:02.208 --> 02:04.000
[boy] I told you it wouldn't float.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.708
-[children laughing]
-[shouts]

02:07.708 --> 02:09.166
Get off me!

02:09.291 --> 02:11.541
Lose your footing again, Galadriel?

02:19.625 --> 02:21.833
It was a good ship, sister.

02:21.916 --> 02:23.833
I made it just as you taught me.

02:24.041 --> 02:25.083
[crickets chirping]

02:25.166 --> 02:30.291
Do you know why a ship floats
and a stone cannot?

02:30.958 --> 02:35.333
Because the stone sees only downward.

02:36.458 --> 02:40.250
The darkness of the water is vast
and irresistible.

02:41.708 --> 02:43.750
The ship feels the darkness as well,

02:43.833 --> 02:47.666
striving moment by moment
to master her and pull her under.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.750
But the ship has a secret.

02:53.375 --> 02:57.291
For unlike the stone,
her gaze is not downward but up.

02:58.666 --> 03:00.875
Fixed upon the light that guides her,

03:01.750 --> 03:04.833
whispering of grander things
than darkness ever knew.

03:06.958 --> 03:10.500
But sometimes the lights shine
just as brightly

03:10.583 --> 03:13.250
reflected in the water
as they do in the sky.

03:13.333 --> 03:16.541
It's hard to say which way is up
and which way is down.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.875
How am I to know which lights to follow?

03:25.416 --> 03:27.791
[Finrod whispering]

03:33.375 --> 03:34.875
But that seems so simple.

03:34.958 --> 03:37.166
The most important truths often are.

03:38.041 --> 03:40.458
But you must learn
to discern them for yourself.

03:40.541 --> 03:43.375
[laughs] I won't always be here
to speak them to you.

03:43.458 --> 03:44.875
You won't?

03:46.250 --> 03:48.750
Come along. Mother and Father are waiting.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.458
[Galadriel]  We had no word for death.

04:02.583 --> 04:05.541
For we thought our joys would be unending.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.833
We thought our light would never dim.

04:28.666 --> 04:31.791
So when the Great Foe, Morgoth,

04:31.875 --> 04:34.916
destroyed the very light of our home...

04:37.958 --> 04:39.791
We resisted.

04:43.583 --> 04:47.250
And a legion of Elves went to war.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.958
We left Valinor, our home,
and journeyed to a distant realm.

04:59.500 --> 05:05.250
One filled with untold perils
and strange creatures beyond count.

05:05.875 --> 05:09.375
A place known as Middle-earth.

05:09.916 --> 05:12.291
-[thunder breaking]
-[dragons screeching]

05:16.833 --> 05:18.375
[crashing]

05:19.583 --> 05:21.083
-[swords clashing]
-[all grunting]

05:32.291 --> 05:34.875
[in Quenya]  Valaron kalanen!

05:34.958 --> 05:40.333
Firuvantë!

05:42.208 --> 05:44.000
[thunder breaking]

05:44.083 --> 05:46.500
[Galadriel in English]
They said it would be over quickly,

05:48.041 --> 05:52.458
but the war left Middle-earth in ruin.

05:55.666 --> 05:59.250
And would last centuries.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.666
Now, we learned many words for death.

06:25.958 --> 06:27.583
[crows cawing]

06:28.916 --> 06:31.875
In the end, Morgoth would be defeated.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.625
But not before much sorrow.

06:38.125 --> 06:42.750
For his Orcs had spread
to every corner of Middle-earth,

06:44.125 --> 06:46.583
Multiplying ever greater

06:46.666 --> 06:50.166
under the command
of his most devoted servant,

06:50.250 --> 06:54.083
a cruel and cunning sorcerer.

06:54.166 --> 06:57.000
They called him Sauron.

06:58.708 --> 07:02.291
My brother vowed to seek him out
and destroy him.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.208
But Sauron found him first

07:09.291 --> 07:11.625
and marked his flesh with a symbol.

07:14.416 --> 07:17.875
One whose meaning even our wisest
could not discern.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.208
And there, in the darkness,

07:25.875 --> 07:29.041
his vow became mine.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.625
And so, we hunted.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.750
To the ends of the Earth we hunted Sauron.

07:41.291 --> 07:43.833
But the trail grew thin.

07:46.416 --> 07:48.208
Year gave way to year.

07:48.958 --> 07:51.166
Century gave way to century.

07:51.708 --> 07:55.375
And for many Elves, the pain of those days

07:55.458 --> 07:58.458
passed out of thought and mind.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.000
More and more of our kind

08:02.083 --> 08:05.583
began to believe that Sauron
was but a memory.

08:06.750 --> 08:10.750
And the threat, at last, was ended.

08:12.583 --> 08:13.500
[grunts]

08:13.583 --> 08:15.916
I wish I could be one of them.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.625
-[wind whooshing]
-[panting]

08:21.333 --> 08:22.833
[grunting]

08:22.916 --> 08:25.916
[wind howling]

09:13.333 --> 09:14.833
Commander Galadriel.

09:16.916 --> 09:20.000
This company has followed you
to the very edge of the world.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.875
But none who ever dared search
for this last stronghold

09:22.958 --> 09:24.375
has ever found anything.

09:25.916 --> 09:28.916
It's been years
since the last Orc was sighted.

09:29.750 --> 09:34.250
Is it not possible the other commanders
are right and our enemy is no more?

09:34.333 --> 09:35.541
Night is closing in.

09:36.291 --> 09:40.291
How long can living flesh endure
where even sunlight fears to tread?

09:44.916 --> 09:47.250
Perhaps we would be wise to camp here.

09:48.041 --> 09:50.250
And tomorrow, begin the journey home.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.166
We are losing the light.

09:57.291 --> 10:00.750
-[thunder breaking]
-[wind whooshing]

10:08.125 --> 10:09.833
[groaning]

10:11.000 --> 10:12.291
Commander, wait!

10:12.375 --> 10:14.875
No. We keep moving.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.791
Galadriel, stop!

10:18.375 --> 10:20.166
[thunder breaking]

10:23.833 --> 10:25.625
[Elf groaning]

10:39.000 --> 10:42.416
There's nothing out here.
We should have been there by now.

10:43.708 --> 10:46.125
[thunder breaking]

10:50.666 --> 10:51.875
We are there.

10:53.375 --> 10:54.833
[thunder breaking]

11:13.333 --> 11:14.750
[Galadriel] This is it.

11:14.833 --> 11:18.041
This is where the Orcs gathered
after Morgoth's defeat.

11:19.125 --> 11:22.041
Far more must have escaped,
than we ever imagined.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.416
My hand is past feeling.

11:27.458 --> 11:28.541
No.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.500
This place is so evil,
our torches give off no warmth.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.416
This way.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.500
[Thondir] How can you be certain?

11:38.041 --> 11:39.666
[Galadriel] It's colder than the rest.

11:48.375 --> 11:52.375
[wind whistling]

12:03.458 --> 12:05.375
[grunting]

12:09.291 --> 12:10.875
A door was filled in here.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.083
Bring it down.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.000
[crashing]

12:45.333 --> 12:47.708
[door creaking]

12:48.833 --> 12:50.625
What devilry is this?

12:53.375 --> 12:56.916
[Galadriel] These Orcs were meddling
with the powers of the Unseen World.

12:57.666 --> 12:59.583
Some dark sorcery of old.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.458
But what was their purpose?

13:06.416 --> 13:09.250
Surely, it is lost to the ages now.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.500
Whatever happened here was long ago.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.333
[hisses]

13:19.125 --> 13:20.208
Water.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.791
[hissing]

13:30.291 --> 13:32.291
Even stone cannot hide the mark

13:32.375 --> 13:34.958
of one whose very hand
is flame unquenched.

13:35.041 --> 13:37.250
[crackling]

13:39.916 --> 13:40.750
[gasps]

13:42.708 --> 13:43.791
He was here.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.666
Sauron was here.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.458
Tell the others to rest while they can.

13:49.541 --> 13:52.750
At sunrise we move on.
We'll take the search further north.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.916
Further north?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.916
This mark was left as a trail
for Orcs to follow.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.333
The last time I saw it was on my brother.

14:00.916 --> 14:02.041
We must follow it.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.583
[Thondir] The mark is centuries old.

14:04.666 --> 14:06.500
Whoever left it could be long dead.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.458
Or lying in wait, gathering strength,

14:08.541 --> 14:10.875
perfecting whatever dark art
eluded him here.

14:10.958 --> 14:12.958
We exceeded our orders months ago.

14:13.041 --> 14:17.083
Surely we must first return home
to take counsel with the High King.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.666
I promise you there is not a soul
amongst our company

14:21.791 --> 14:23.708
who yearns for home more than I.

14:25.791 --> 14:28.791
I can still feel the light of the Trees
on my face.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.208
I can still see it.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.375
And until we are certain

14:36.875 --> 14:40.458
every trace of our enemy is vanquished...

14:42.958 --> 14:44.458
I can never return.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.958
[thunder breaking]

15:14.208 --> 15:15.958
[low growling]

15:17.583 --> 15:19.375
[in Quenya] Snow-troll!

15:19.458 --> 15:21.458
[snow-troll roaring]

15:29.375 --> 15:30.416
[grunts]

15:38.916 --> 15:40.041
[snow-troll roars]

15:40.500 --> 15:41.583
[Elves scream]

15:42.208 --> 15:43.083
[gasps]

15:45.041 --> 15:47.750
-[snow-troll growling]
-[Elves shouting, groaning]

15:54.125 --> 15:58.250
[roaring]

15:59.416 --> 16:00.916
[Elf screaming]

16:09.333 --> 16:10.541
[groaning]

16:19.208 --> 16:20.666
[screeches]

16:25.166 --> 16:26.458
[groaning]

16:35.541 --> 16:37.375
[in English] We should never
have come in here.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.833
We leave soon enough.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.833
The order is given.

16:41.958 --> 16:43.458
We march at first light.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.500
Then you shall do so alone.

16:52.958 --> 16:54.500
[swords unsheathing]

16:58.958 --> 17:01.958
[thunder breaking]

17:12.625 --> 17:14.125
[breathing heavily]

17:45.541 --> 17:48.541
[birds chirping]

17:55.666 --> 17:57.875
[young Man] Something's wrong here.
Nothing to hunt.

17:57.958 --> 17:59.791
Wolves in every thicket.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.541
Don't you think
it's the least bit strange?

18:02.625 --> 18:04.375
World's strange.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.416
If I let 'em pitch-kettle me,

18:06.500 --> 18:08.791
I'd never get off me barstool.

18:08.916 --> 18:10.625
-[footsteps, rustling]
-[young Man] Oi, oi!

18:13.250 --> 18:14.833
Keep walkin'.

18:14.916 --> 18:16.000
Why?

18:17.750 --> 18:20.333
Looked like a badger. Maybe a fox.

18:20.416 --> 18:21.750
More likely a Harfoot.

18:21.833 --> 18:23.083
A Harfoot?

18:23.166 --> 18:25.000
Ugh. Don't care to be seein' none,

18:25.083 --> 18:28.125
but if you do, watch yourself.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.541
Dangerous creatures they are.

18:31.958 --> 18:32.958
You're making it up.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.500
[chuckling]

18:35.250 --> 18:37.375
Come on. Rattle your dags!

18:38.083 --> 18:41.250
Let's just get to the lake before sundown.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.625
[blows flute]

18:56.708 --> 18:58.500
[creaking]

18:58.958 --> 19:00.541
-[both] Huh? Huh.
-[flute blows]

19:01.541 --> 19:02.750
[buzzing]

19:03.375 --> 19:06.666
[sniffing]

19:09.541 --> 19:11.208
Clear and clear.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.333
[creaking, rustling]

19:14.708 --> 19:15.583
[grunts]

19:18.541 --> 19:19.583
[crying]

19:21.166 --> 19:23.416
[lively chatter]

19:25.208 --> 19:26.250
[Marigold] Nori!

19:26.750 --> 19:28.208
[Harfoot exclaiming]

19:28.291 --> 19:29.375
Nori!

19:30.500 --> 19:31.666
Nori!

19:32.208 --> 19:34.375
[chattering continues]

19:37.166 --> 19:38.333
Nori!

19:39.166 --> 19:40.083
[grunts]

19:57.791 --> 20:00.416
Travelers? At this time of year?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.791
-It's an omen, I warrant ya.
-[Sadoc grumbles]

20:02.875 --> 20:05.458
-Mmm-hmm. Bad one. As bad as they come.
-Easy, Malva.

20:05.541 --> 20:08.791
The last time we had travelers this early,
it was the Great Frost.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.250
And there's no misremembering
how bleak a season that was.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.333
More than likely they just got lost,
that's it.

20:14.416 --> 20:15.833
[snaps fingers] Has to be the reason.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.250
[Largo] You're gonna spoil dinner.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.208
[Marigold] I've looked high and low again.

20:19.291 --> 20:20.958
The wee ones are still out there.

20:21.041 --> 20:23.583
They'll be fine, Goldie.

20:23.666 --> 20:26.375
Nori's with them. You know Nori.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.291
Yes. I do.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.083
[children giggling]

20:30.708 --> 20:32.291
[Poppy] Can we turn back now?

20:32.375 --> 20:34.875
There's 110 things out here
that could kill us.

20:34.958 --> 20:38.250
[Nori] Hundred-eleven
if you count you worrying to death.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.833
[Poppy] You know the rules.
We're not supposed to be out this far.

20:40.916 --> 20:43.541
Don't be... If we didn't do everything
we weren't supposed to,

20:43.625 --> 20:45.250
we'd hardly do anything at all.

20:45.375 --> 20:46.208
[child] Me first!

20:48.375 --> 20:50.750
[Nori] Go on, now. Watch the puddle.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.375
Watch your head.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.208
[children giggling]

20:55.291 --> 20:56.125
[Nori] This way!

20:56.625 --> 20:57.750
[Poppy] Nori!

20:58.625 --> 20:59.916
-I'm stuck.
-I've got you.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.541
-[both grunting]
-It's...

21:01.625 --> 21:03.041
Nori! Ow!

21:03.125 --> 21:04.375
[squishes]

21:07.916 --> 21:09.000
Enchanting.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.083
[laughs]

21:10.708 --> 21:11.583
[spits]

21:11.875 --> 21:13.125
[laughing] Come on.

21:13.208 --> 21:14.958
Can we turn back now?

21:15.041 --> 21:17.750
-Oh, but you haven't even seen it yet.
-[Poppy whining] Seen what?

21:17.833 --> 21:20.208
Good place for a hill-troll to hide,
if you ask me.

21:20.291 --> 21:21.833
[laughs]

21:21.916 --> 21:23.541
Oh, great glory and splendor.

21:26.791 --> 21:28.916
[laughter, lively chatter]

21:29.000 --> 21:30.041
[Poppy] Oh!

21:33.833 --> 21:35.000
[Poppy] Nori!

21:37.541 --> 21:38.375
Mmm.

21:38.791 --> 21:39.625
[sniffs]

21:42.916 --> 21:43.750
Mmm.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.291
[laughter]

21:49.375 --> 21:50.958
[exclaiming playfully]

21:55.000 --> 21:56.166
[Dilly] Nori!

21:57.375 --> 21:58.541
I found something.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.708
There's something in the mud.

22:02.583 --> 22:03.750
What is it?

22:05.833 --> 22:07.250
It looks like a footsie.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.541
A dog.

22:11.250 --> 22:14.166
Just a dog.
You know how dogs love berries.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.416
-[rustling]
-[gasps]

22:16.500 --> 22:17.541
[wings flutter]

22:20.916 --> 22:23.000
Is he going to eat our berries?

22:23.083 --> 22:25.166
Not if he doesn't see us, he isn't.

22:25.916 --> 22:29.250
Hey. Twos and hands, everyone. Time to go.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.791
-[mouthful] What's the big rush?
-[whispers] Wolf.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.041
[gulping]

22:34.125 --> 22:35.875
You heard your sister. Time to go.

22:35.958 --> 22:37.791
Go on, now. Come on.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.750
First one back to camp
gets the first pie at Harvest Fest.

22:40.833 --> 22:41.833
Let's go.

22:42.125 --> 22:43.375
[children chattering happily]

22:43.458 --> 22:47.333
Remember, if anybody asks,
we were just out digging for snails.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.625
[sniffing]

22:55.666 --> 22:57.041
[birds chirping]

22:57.125 --> 23:01.083
[Elrond in Quenya]  "I Palannúmen...
I Alfirimë Nóri...

23:01.166 --> 23:02.916
"Na metta avantë...

23:03.875 --> 23:05.083
[in English] "Home.

23:07.625 --> 23:11.458
"For centuries, they have swept
across crag and crevice,

23:11.541 --> 23:14.166
"washing away the last remnants
of our enemy.

23:14.750 --> 23:17.416
"Like a spring rain over the bones of a...

23:18.375 --> 23:19.458
"Dead animal."

23:21.583 --> 23:24.916
"Spring rain over the bones of a..."

23:26.708 --> 23:28.041
[Elf] Herald Elrond.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.666
At last.

23:32.833 --> 23:35.666
Yes. It's almost as if I didn't wish
to be found. [chuckles]

23:35.958 --> 23:37.250
What tidings?

23:37.333 --> 23:39.083
The Council regrets to inform you

23:39.166 --> 23:41.750
you won't be permitted
to attend the next session.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.375
Elf-lords only.

23:48.375 --> 23:49.791
Is there anything else?

23:49.875 --> 23:52.000
Yes. Your friend has arrived.

23:52.916 --> 23:55.333
She's here? Why didn't you say so?

24:02.250 --> 24:03.458
For the ceremony.

24:11.791 --> 24:16.083
[birds chirping]

24:21.500 --> 24:22.666
[Elrond] Galadriel.

24:24.666 --> 24:25.625
Elrond.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.041
[in Quenya]
Lindon receives you with grace.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.791
With grace, I am received.

24:30.916 --> 24:32.083
[chuckles]

24:36.291 --> 24:40.208
[in English] I hear it's said that
when you cross over, you hear a song.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.416
One whose memory we all carry.

24:43.625 --> 24:45.083
And you are immersed in a light,

24:45.166 --> 24:48.875
more intoxicating than any sensation
in all of Middle-earth.

24:48.958 --> 24:53.208
When I was a child,
it was the only feeling I knew.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.000
And look at you now.

24:55.083 --> 24:58.083
Commander of the Northern Armies.
Warrior of the Wastelands.

24:58.750 --> 25:03.041
I half expected you to arrive
caked in grime and mud.

25:03.125 --> 25:06.166
This time, frostbite and troll blood.

25:07.166 --> 25:08.250
And no army.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.791
Tell me everything.

25:11.458 --> 25:14.791
[Galadriel] This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.125
He's still out there.

25:16.541 --> 25:18.166
The question now is, where?

25:19.250 --> 25:22.125
I intend to ask of the King
a fresh company.

25:22.208 --> 25:25.208
-If he supplies enough to...
-You have only just arrived.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.500
Must you speak of leaving again so soon?

25:27.583 --> 25:29.416
You know very well why I must.

25:30.250 --> 25:33.666
There will be ample time later
to discuss official matters.

25:34.708 --> 25:36.291
I want to hear about you.

25:37.708 --> 25:39.291
Your harrowing journey.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.083
Why, Elrond.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.291
You really have become a politician.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.125
You make it sound so grim.

25:45.208 --> 25:48.541
I am not some courtier
to be placated by idle flattery.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.291
I demand to speak with the King directly.

25:54.708 --> 25:56.416
You have made that plain.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.708
So I will be equally plain.

26:02.750 --> 26:05.583
It was not your company
who defied you out there,

26:06.083 --> 26:08.416
but rather you who defied the High King,

26:09.291 --> 26:12.041
by refusing to heed
any limit placed upon you.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.333
In an act of magnanimity,

26:15.416 --> 26:18.125
he has chosen
to honor your accomplishments...

26:18.958 --> 26:21.291
Rather than dwell upon your insolence.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.416
Test him again

26:25.500 --> 26:28.916
and you may find him less receptive
than you might have hoped.

26:35.416 --> 26:38.458
Are you going
to arrange an audience or not?

26:40.583 --> 26:43.541
If after the ceremony
that is still your wish,

26:43.625 --> 26:45.041
you shall have it.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.666
[lively chatter, laughter]

26:52.750 --> 26:53.958
[chuckles]

26:56.875 --> 26:58.833
Ah. She has returned.

26:58.916 --> 27:01.500
-How fare thee?
-Well and well, Father.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.041
And look at her!

27:03.125 --> 27:05.166
You found all that
down by the river bank, did you?

27:05.250 --> 27:06.125
Mm-hmm.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.916
Did you hear about the travelers?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.416
-Travelers?
-Mm-hmm. Hunters.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.333
Two of them.

27:13.416 --> 27:15.500
Big as great boulders.

27:15.583 --> 27:17.041
Right up on that ridge.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.625
I can't believe I missed them.

27:18.708 --> 27:22.375
Maybe you ought to stick closer to home,
that way you don't miss anything, hmm?

27:23.333 --> 27:24.791
[sniffs, gasps]

27:24.875 --> 27:26.083
[both laugh]

27:31.208 --> 27:33.416
You went to the old farm again.

27:34.125 --> 27:35.291
Didn't you?

27:36.416 --> 27:37.416
I was careful.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.416
But the children might not be.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.083
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

27:41.166 --> 27:43.333
We never get hunters up here
before the harvest.

27:43.416 --> 27:45.625
-[Marigold] Mmm.
-Or wolves.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.041
I wonder if there's trouble down south.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.583
And what concern is that of yours,
Elanor Brandyfoot?

27:58.666 --> 28:00.375
Haven't you ever wondered...

28:01.416 --> 28:02.916
What else is out there?

28:03.541 --> 28:04.875
How far the river flows

28:04.958 --> 28:08.583
or where the sparrows
learn the new songs they sing in spring?

28:09.166 --> 28:13.333
I can't help but feel
there's wonders in this world.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.500
Beyond our wanderin'.

28:16.458 --> 28:18.000
I've told you.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.583
Countless times.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.916
Elves have forests to protect.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.250
Dwarves, their mines.
Men, their fields of grain.

28:29.166 --> 28:32.833
Even trees have to worry
about the soil beneath their roots.

28:33.458 --> 28:37.291
But we Harfoots are free
from the worries of the wide world.

28:37.375 --> 28:41.125
We are but ripples in a long, long stream.

28:41.541 --> 28:43.958
Our paths set by the passing seasons.

28:44.833 --> 28:47.708
Nobody goes off trail
and nobody walks alone.

28:49.708 --> 28:52.416
We have each other. We're safe.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.375
That is how we survive.

28:58.041 --> 29:00.875
[sighs] Go on. Help your father.

29:03.583 --> 29:07.000
That's your problem.
You see, a wheel's supposed to be round.

29:40.708 --> 29:44.666
[Gil-galad] These most valiant of warriors

29:44.750 --> 29:49.291
kneel here before us, victorious.

29:50.958 --> 29:53.708
For though Morgoth fell an Age ago,

29:54.416 --> 29:58.208
some feared a new evil might arise
from his shadow.

29:58.291 --> 30:00.125
So for centuries now,

30:00.208 --> 30:04.291
these soldiers have swept
across crag and crevice,

30:04.375 --> 30:07.625
washing away the last remnants
of our enemy

30:07.708 --> 30:11.416
like a spring rain over the bones
of a spoilt carcass.

30:14.125 --> 30:15.458
And now, at last,

30:16.666 --> 30:20.041
they return to us in triumph,

30:20.125 --> 30:23.250
for they have proven beyond any doubt

30:23.333 --> 30:27.458
that our days of war are over.

30:29.791 --> 30:30.875
Today...

30:32.708 --> 30:35.541
Our days of peace begin.

30:45.666 --> 30:47.500
[sighing]

31:01.541 --> 31:04.958
And as a measure of our gratitude,

31:06.041 --> 31:08.583
these heroes shall be granted an honor

31:08.666 --> 31:11.416
unrivaled in all our lore.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.791
They will be escorted to the Grey Havens

31:14.875 --> 31:19.208
and granted passage across the sea
to dwell for all eternity

31:20.291 --> 31:24.000
in the Blessed Realm, the Far West.

31:24.083 --> 31:27.250
The Undying Lands of Valinor.

31:28.083 --> 31:31.916
At last, they are going home.

31:32.041 --> 31:33.166
[applause]

31:52.291 --> 31:56.458
[fireworks whistling, exploding]

32:34.041 --> 32:37.375
Are you just going to stand there,
breathing like an Orc?

32:40.583 --> 32:44.000
It is said the wine of victory is sweetest

32:44.083 --> 32:46.666
for those in whose bitter trials
it has fermented.

32:47.416 --> 32:49.250
I do not feel victorious.

32:49.333 --> 32:52.375
You deserve the honors of this day.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.916
Your brother would be proud.

33:01.208 --> 33:03.958
I remember when the first of these
were carved.

33:05.291 --> 33:08.708
The likeness of one fallen,
preserved upon a living thing.

33:08.791 --> 33:12.541
I suppose some part of me
always believed my rest would be here,

33:12.625 --> 33:13.916
with them.

33:14.958 --> 33:16.875
But instead, I am to leave them.

33:18.458 --> 33:22.458
This is the gift of your king.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
A gift I have decided to refuse.

33:29.125 --> 33:30.125
Galadriel, you...

33:30.208 --> 33:32.916
My brother gave his life hunting Sauron.

33:34.416 --> 33:36.416
His task is now mine.

33:39.250 --> 33:42.458
I go to seek the enemy
that escaped us in the north.

33:44.083 --> 33:46.125
Alone, if I must.

33:48.291 --> 33:51.291
Ah, yes. Your mystery sigil.

33:51.375 --> 33:53.208
I shared it with the High King.

33:53.291 --> 33:55.083
-Then why would...
-Because seeing a sigil

33:55.166 --> 33:57.708
does not mean you're any closer
to finding Sauron.

33:57.791 --> 34:01.166
It is over. The evil is gone.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.625
Then why is it not gone from in here?

34:05.041 --> 34:07.041
After all you have endured...

34:08.416 --> 34:10.666
It is only natural to feel conflicted.

34:11.666 --> 34:13.125
Conflicted?

34:16.750 --> 34:19.666
I am grateful you have not known evil
as I have.

34:20.875 --> 34:23.125
But you have not seen what I have seen.

34:23.208 --> 34:24.250
I've seen my share.

34:24.333 --> 34:27.958
You have not seen what I have seen.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.916
Evil does not sleep, Elrond.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.458
It waits.

34:34.125 --> 34:36.958
And in the moment of our complacency,

34:37.041 --> 34:38.458
it blinds us.

34:40.416 --> 34:43.041
Let us say that all is as you fear,

34:43.125 --> 34:46.458
and this enemy is out there somewhere,
lying in wait.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.291
Do you truly believe seeking him out
will satisfy you?

34:50.750 --> 34:54.041
That one more Orc upon the point
of your blade will bring you peace?

34:54.125 --> 34:56.041
-If you are wrong...
-I'm not wrong.

34:56.125 --> 34:57.583
If you are wrong,

34:58.458 --> 35:01.625
will you lead more Elves
to die in far-off lands?

35:03.458 --> 35:05.583
To convince yourself you have done enough,

35:05.666 --> 35:08.500
how many more statues
would you add to this path?

35:09.333 --> 35:11.958
No one in history
has ever refused the call.

35:12.791 --> 35:14.875
Do so now, it may never come again.

35:15.750 --> 35:18.750
You will linger here, an outcast,

35:18.833 --> 35:21.083
poisoned in dark whispers and dreams.

35:21.166 --> 35:23.625
And in the West,
do you think my fate would be better?

35:25.458 --> 35:28.916
Where song would mock the cries
of battle in my ears?

35:30.916 --> 35:34.833
You say I have won victory
over all the horrors of Middle-earth.

35:36.375 --> 35:38.583
Yet you would leave them alive in me?

35:39.666 --> 35:41.000
To take with me?

35:42.000 --> 35:45.916
Undying, unchanging, unbreaking,

35:46.958 --> 35:49.333
into the land of winterless spring?

35:49.416 --> 35:51.833
Only in the Blessed Realm

35:51.916 --> 35:54.416
can that which is broken in you be healed.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.333
Go there.

35:56.833 --> 35:58.625
Go, and I promise you...

35:59.333 --> 36:03.250
If but a whisper of a rumor
of the threat you perceive proves true,

36:03.750 --> 36:06.125
I will not rest until it is put right.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.416
You have fought long enough, Galadriel.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.541
Put up your sword.

36:15.291 --> 36:17.208
Without it, what am I to be?

36:17.291 --> 36:18.916
What you have always been.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.125
My friend.

37:03.875 --> 37:06.416
[Men grunting]

37:14.125 --> 37:16.250
-[goat bleating]
-[dog barking]

37:16.958 --> 37:19.583
[indistinct chatter]

37:20.291 --> 37:21.708
Evenin'.

37:21.791 --> 37:23.333
Caraes  in three moves.

37:24.791 --> 37:25.833
Hmm.

37:26.916 --> 37:27.750
Ha!

37:28.166 --> 37:29.625
Poisoned more likely.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.625
Poisoned? By who?

37:32.166 --> 37:35.250
[Waldreg] For all we know,
the onion-eyed scut done it himself.

37:35.333 --> 37:36.291
[chattering stops]

37:47.375 --> 37:49.250
[Waldreg] Arondir. [chuckles]

37:49.916 --> 37:52.250
Has it really been a fortnight already?

37:53.458 --> 37:54.583
[Arondir] It has.

37:54.708 --> 37:56.250
[dog whimpering]

37:56.416 --> 38:00.083
Uh, very little to report this go-round,
I'm afraid.

38:00.166 --> 38:03.583
A couple of shabby disputes,
a bit of uneven dice-handling.

38:04.166 --> 38:06.291
And... Oh, yes!

38:06.375 --> 38:08.833
Had a bit of a thrill in here,
Trewsday last.

38:08.916 --> 38:10.833
Bit of a row over a girl.

38:11.250 --> 38:14.666
His eye was lazy, hers overactive,
if you take my meaning.

38:15.208 --> 38:16.250
[chuckles]

38:16.875 --> 38:19.000
Do you care for a drink, soldier?

38:19.083 --> 38:21.291
Well, my well is yours, as ever.

38:21.375 --> 38:22.875
And the poisoning?

38:23.375 --> 38:24.416
What poisoning?

38:24.500 --> 38:26.291
The one you were just discussing.

38:26.375 --> 38:27.500
No, no, no, no...

38:27.583 --> 38:30.625
It was but poisoned grass
he was twattlin' about.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.958
A fellow passed through,
said his grazing's gone rotten.

38:35.041 --> 38:37.208
That only weeds will grow.

38:37.291 --> 38:40.000
This fellow, where was he from?

38:40.500 --> 38:42.000
Didn't say. East, I think.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.166
On what day was he here?

38:44.250 --> 38:47.291
-Oh, let it go, knife-ears.
-[slams]

38:48.208 --> 38:50.250
It's a bloody patch of grass.

38:51.333 --> 38:55.625
The lot you lump us in with
died off a thousand years ago.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.541
When are you people gonna let the past go?

39:02.416 --> 39:05.958
The past is with us all,
whether we like it or not.

39:06.833 --> 39:10.833
One day, our true king will return.

39:11.958 --> 39:16.458
And pry us right out
from under your pointy boots.

39:16.541 --> 39:18.750
-Easy, lad. Quench the fire now.
-[glass shatters]

39:19.500 --> 39:20.666
[patrons gasp]

39:31.083 --> 39:32.000
Come on, lad.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.208
Will there be anythin' else then?

39:41.000 --> 39:43.791
[lively chatter continues]

39:46.541 --> 39:49.375
[birds chirping]

40:00.791 --> 40:02.208
Give me your hand.

40:16.916 --> 40:17.791
Hmm.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.000
Alfirin  seeds.

40:22.916 --> 40:23.958
[sighs]

40:25.000 --> 40:27.666
I've not seen this flower
since I was a child.

40:28.416 --> 40:29.916
Where did you find these?

40:30.583 --> 40:34.041
I had to trade with another healer
who was passing through.

40:34.125 --> 40:36.250
We crush the petals to form a salve.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.958
You crush them?

40:38.041 --> 40:39.500
[chuckles] Gently.

40:42.958 --> 40:44.958
Are there healers among your kind?

40:45.041 --> 40:46.416
There are.

40:46.500 --> 40:48.333
But we call them artificers.

40:49.291 --> 40:53.333
Most wounds to our bodies heal
of their own accord,

40:53.416 --> 40:57.833
so, it is their labor instead to render
hidden truths as works of beauty.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.458
For beauty has great power
to heal the soul.

41:03.750 --> 41:06.458
Then I hope
you find  alfirin  flowers beautiful.

41:07.708 --> 41:09.000
-[door opens]
-[both gasp]

41:13.750 --> 41:15.416
Until next time, then.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.583
Soldier. [sighs]

41:27.291 --> 41:28.916
Anything to report?

41:30.208 --> 41:31.875
Nothing out of the ordinary.

41:34.458 --> 41:35.666
And the well...

41:37.083 --> 41:38.333
How was it?

41:39.875 --> 41:41.291
Did you draw some water?

41:42.208 --> 41:43.958
We are awaited at Ostirith.

41:46.083 --> 41:48.916
Have you considered
the consequences I might face

41:49.000 --> 41:51.916
if the Watchwarden were to discover
what it is that you're doing?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.666
Afraid I don't take your meaning.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.250
It's difficult enough
keeping watch over them

41:55.333 --> 41:57.416
without having to keep
one eye squarely on you.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.750
Or do you think me blind?

41:58.833 --> 42:02.000
No. I think you talk too much.

42:02.708 --> 42:04.625
And you smell of rotten leaves.

42:04.708 --> 42:06.208
No, I don't.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.458
Yes, you do.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.000
[sniffs]

42:15.291 --> 42:18.291
[Médhor] My point is this.
Only twice in known history

42:18.375 --> 42:21.500
has a pairing between Elves and humans
even been attempted.

42:21.583 --> 42:24.083
And on each occasion, it ended in tragedy.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.250
It ended in death.

42:25.333 --> 42:27.250
You need not remind me.

42:27.333 --> 42:28.541
[sighs]

42:28.833 --> 42:30.416
Then why do you persist?

42:31.208 --> 42:32.916
Give me one reason. One.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.833
[Elf] Arondir! Médhor!

42:36.291 --> 42:39.208
The High King has declared
the days of war are over.

42:40.666 --> 42:43.083
All the far outposts are being disbanded.

42:44.541 --> 42:45.625
We're leaving.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.833
[wind whooshing]

43:12.791 --> 43:14.375
-Taking a last look?
-Mm-hmm.

43:16.500 --> 43:19.000
Seventy-nine years
I've been stationed here.

43:21.125 --> 43:23.791
I suppose I've grown accustomed to it.

43:25.458 --> 43:29.000
[Revion] Can you believe this place
was once a barren scrap of rock?

43:29.083 --> 43:31.083
It has changed much, Watchwarden.

43:31.958 --> 43:34.041
But the Men who live here have not.

43:34.541 --> 43:38.541
The blood of those who stood with Morgoth
still darkens their veins.

43:40.958 --> 43:42.833
That was long ago, Watchwarden.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.541
What were you before the war?

43:50.458 --> 43:51.583
A grower.

43:51.666 --> 43:54.250
Then you shall be returning home
to far more than you left.

43:55.416 --> 43:58.208
Honors, title.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.166
Your life will begin anew.

44:02.166 --> 44:04.208
But mark this, Arondir,

44:04.833 --> 44:08.416
that for 79 years, you've kept watch
over the men and women of Tirharad,

44:08.500 --> 44:11.416
not because of what their ancestors
once did...

44:12.875 --> 44:14.875
But because of who they still are.

44:20.416 --> 44:21.625
And be grateful.

44:23.166 --> 44:25.333
That you need never see them again.

44:30.166 --> 44:31.291
[ladder creaking]

44:31.375 --> 44:33.375
[wind whooshing]

44:59.791 --> 45:00.791
[sighs]

45:04.041 --> 45:07.166
Careful. That's fire-root powder.
You have to do it slowly.

45:07.250 --> 45:09.333
Go any slower, I'll be stuck here all day.

45:09.416 --> 45:11.291
You're in a boil this morning.

45:11.375 --> 45:14.000
Hardly slept.
Mice were dancing a proper jig

45:14.083 --> 45:16.125
-under the floorboards.
-Again?

45:16.208 --> 45:18.916
Last three nights.
Scratchin' and scrapin'.

45:22.416 --> 45:24.250
What's one of them doing here?

45:35.250 --> 45:36.750
I heard you were leaving.

45:37.791 --> 45:38.958
We are.

45:41.166 --> 45:43.166
Where's the rest of your company?

45:44.458 --> 45:48.000
Most likely searching for me
at this very moment.

45:48.708 --> 45:50.375
Then why are you at my home?

46:03.750 --> 46:05.583
Say what you wish to say.

46:05.666 --> 46:07.166
I have said it already.

46:08.041 --> 46:11.583
A hundred times over,
in every way but words.

46:13.583 --> 46:14.708
-Mother.
-[gasps]

46:16.250 --> 46:17.916
There's a man here for you.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.541
[knocking on door]

46:26.875 --> 46:27.958
Mum.

46:31.291 --> 46:33.125
[Tredwill] You heal animals, too?

46:35.166 --> 46:37.583
-[cow moaning]
-If you could just give her a look.

46:38.500 --> 46:41.541
She's got some sort of a sickness.

46:42.291 --> 46:43.708
[Arondir] What manner of sickness?

46:43.791 --> 46:44.625
[gasps]

46:51.041 --> 46:52.541
[Bronwyn] It isn't a fever.

46:54.541 --> 46:57.166
And she doesn't appear to have any sores.

46:58.375 --> 47:00.000
Where has she been grazing?

47:00.083 --> 47:01.833
Hmm. She wandered east a few days ago.

47:02.958 --> 47:04.541
Think she might have ate something?

47:05.833 --> 47:09.125
-[cow groaning]
-[squishing]

47:09.208 --> 47:12.041
What was that, squirted out of her?

47:13.333 --> 47:14.916
How far east?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.375
[Tredwill] She might've made it
as far as Hordern.

47:24.625 --> 47:25.833
Where are you going?

47:25.916 --> 47:29.166
Hordern's a day's journey.
If I leave now, I can reach it by dusk.

47:29.250 --> 47:30.583
[Bronwyn] I'm going with you.

47:40.458 --> 47:43.000
[door creaking]

47:43.083 --> 47:44.833
Be quick about it.

47:44.916 --> 47:47.208
He finds us in here,
he'll knock our teeth out.

47:47.750 --> 47:49.500
[chickens clucking]

47:50.875 --> 47:53.000
Only spotted it by mistake.

47:53.083 --> 47:54.375
Stepped on a lucky board.

47:56.916 --> 47:58.083
So, tell me,

47:59.083 --> 48:01.625
is it true? About your mum?

48:02.583 --> 48:04.000
Is what true?

48:04.708 --> 48:08.500
Heard Waldreg caught herself
and one of the pointies

48:08.625 --> 48:11.125
mighty sweet back of his well
the other day.

48:11.208 --> 48:12.333
Who told you that?

48:12.416 --> 48:13.666
Everybody.

48:14.125 --> 48:15.291
It's a lie.

48:15.833 --> 48:18.375
Maybe that's why your father
run off like he done.

48:18.458 --> 48:19.791
My father didn't run off.

48:19.875 --> 48:21.041
Then what happened to him?

48:21.791 --> 48:23.458
You don't even know, do you?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.833
Salty rascal's got the King's bounty
down there.

48:31.416 --> 48:32.916
[Theo] This is the real bounty.

48:53.125 --> 48:54.125
Watch it!

48:54.541 --> 48:56.000
[door creaks]

48:56.625 --> 48:57.708
Go on, quick.

49:02.666 --> 49:07.541
[rumbling]

49:08.541 --> 49:11.708
-[blazing]
-[voices whispering in Black Speech]

49:14.583 --> 49:16.583
[waves crashing]

49:36.541 --> 49:38.541
She has passed beyond my sight.

49:39.750 --> 49:42.833
Galadriel was so certain
her search should continue.

49:44.083 --> 49:47.083
[Gil-galad] We foresaw that if it had,

49:47.166 --> 49:52.541
she might have inadvertently kept alive
the very evil she sought to defeat.

49:54.583 --> 49:57.666
For the same wind
that seeks to blow out a fire

49:57.750 --> 50:00.166
may also cause its spread.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.750
Then the shadow she sought...

50:06.583 --> 50:08.166
You believe it does exist?

50:08.791 --> 50:11.416
Set your mind at peace about it.

50:12.750 --> 50:14.291
What you did was right.

50:15.041 --> 50:18.333
For Galadriel and for Middle-earth.

50:20.291 --> 50:21.750
It's hard to see what is right...

50:24.208 --> 50:26.416
When friendship and duty are mingled.

50:28.416 --> 50:31.083
Such is the burden of those who lead

50:32.000 --> 50:34.208
and those who would seek to.

50:35.958 --> 50:38.250
Galadriel sails to the sunset.

50:38.333 --> 50:43.166
You and I must look to the new sunrise.

50:45.291 --> 50:46.458
To that end,

50:48.041 --> 50:51.625
are you acquainted
with the work of Lord Celebrimbor?

50:51.708 --> 50:52.583
[laughs]

50:52.666 --> 50:54.666
The greatest of Elven-smiths, of course.

50:55.500 --> 50:59.166
I've admired his artistry
since I was a child. Why do you ask?

50:59.250 --> 51:04.000
He is about to embark on a new project.
One of singular importance.

51:05.083 --> 51:08.208
And we've decided
that you will be working with him.

51:11.166 --> 51:14.666
But I'll allow you to explain the details,
Lord Celebrimbor.

51:30.250 --> 51:33.291
First the big people, now the stars.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.333
Eyes open when they should be sleeping.

51:41.291 --> 51:42.583
Almost like...

51:44.208 --> 51:46.375
Like they're watching for something.

51:46.875 --> 51:47.958
Watching for what?

51:48.041 --> 51:48.875
[thud]

51:48.958 --> 51:51.833
A tongue-lashing,
if you don't mind your own cartwheels.

51:51.916 --> 51:53.750
What is it? What do you see?

51:53.833 --> 51:56.041
Elanor Brandyfoot,
with your father's nose,

51:56.125 --> 51:57.958
and always poking it into trouble,

51:58.041 --> 52:02.250
you are far too curious and meddlesome
to have been born a Harfoot.

52:02.333 --> 52:05.041
Are you quite certain
you're not part squirrel?

52:05.125 --> 52:06.208
-[slams book]
-[coughs]

52:06.458 --> 52:09.208
Sadoc. Sadoc, please.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.208
Tell me.

52:13.958 --> 52:16.541
[whispers] The skies are strange.

52:18.916 --> 52:20.208
[whispers] Strange.

52:20.291 --> 52:21.375
Strange how?

52:21.458 --> 52:23.333
[Largo] Nori! Do you have that grease?

52:23.416 --> 52:24.666
On my way.

52:27.583 --> 52:29.416
[crickets chirping]

52:33.416 --> 52:35.958
How familiar are you
with the townsfolk of Hordern?

52:36.041 --> 52:38.875
Very, I should hope. I was born there.

52:40.875 --> 52:42.041
Why?

52:42.125 --> 52:45.583
The people of Hordern were known
for having been especially strong

52:45.666 --> 52:47.333
in their loyalty to Morgoth.

52:48.458 --> 52:49.875
What did you just say?

52:53.916 --> 52:55.166
The truth.

52:56.416 --> 52:58.416
You're talking about my friends.

52:58.500 --> 53:01.083
Close kin, I know them.
There are good people there.

53:02.083 --> 53:03.000
[sighs]

53:05.250 --> 53:07.041
That is why I'm here with you.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.125
Instead of the Watchwarden.

53:12.166 --> 53:13.416
Bronwyn.

53:20.125 --> 53:24.041
You're the only kind touch
I've known all my days in this land.

53:27.666 --> 53:29.708
[rumbling in distance]

53:36.541 --> 53:39.041
[Bronwyn panting]

53:40.583 --> 53:41.833
Hordern.

54:36.875 --> 54:37.958
[sighs]

54:42.166 --> 54:43.166
[shudders]

54:51.833 --> 54:54.833
[wind blowing]

54:56.375 --> 55:01.250
[birds singing in distance]

55:08.333 --> 55:11.333
[birds trilling]

55:24.625 --> 55:27.625
[trilling continues]

55:42.541 --> 55:45.666
[whooshing]

56:11.250 --> 56:16.916
[Finrod echoing]  Do you know why
a ship floats and a stone cannot?

56:18.583 --> 56:22.750
[whooshing, crackling]

56:29.416 --> 56:32.833
[whooshing, crackling]

56:51.958 --> 56:53.125
[Thondir] Galadriel.

56:54.875 --> 56:57.875
[whooshing, crackling]

57:09.041 --> 57:10.458
Give me your hand.

57:23.208 --> 57:26.208
[young Galadriel]  But sometimes
the lights shine just as brightly

57:26.291 --> 57:28.958
reflected in the water
as they do in the sky.

57:30.666 --> 57:32.458
How am I to know which lights to follow?

57:34.750 --> 57:36.750
[whispering] Sometimes we cannot know

57:38.500 --> 57:40.500
until we have touched the darkness.

57:52.125 --> 57:53.208
[Thondir] Galadriel!

58:08.791 --> 58:11.916
[whooshing, crackling]

58:12.791 --> 58:13.625
[explosion]

58:23.333 --> 58:28.166
[rumbling, whooshing]

58:39.250 --> 58:42.250
[crickets chirping]

58:58.416 --> 59:03.166
[voices whispering in Black Speech]

59:05.250 --> 59:08.250
[crackling]

59:28.666 --> 59:29.750
[gasps]
