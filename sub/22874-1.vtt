Are we interrupting?

27:23.520 --> 27:25.246
No, no. Please come in.

27:25.248 --> 27:27.486
Oh, um... It's an emergency
at the Ministry.

27:27.488 --> 27:30.177
I'm sorry, I have to go.
I'll see you later.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.110
Girls... [claps] Go practice.

27:34.112 --> 27:37.535
I'm Sita. And you're Linda.
The beautiful American

27:37.537 --> 27:39.935
who's replacing the drunk,
adultering salesman.

27:39.937 --> 27:41.661
Wow, word really gets around.

27:41.663 --> 27:42.721
We call it the Rice Paddy Radio.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.591
You're new here, so you're
coming to my family's house

27:46.593 --> 27:48.062
- for dinner tonight.
- Cool.

27:48.064 --> 27:50.366
- [girl] Yeah, you now.
- Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

27:50.368 --> 27:52.064
[music plays]

27:52.672 --> 27:54.237
Hands in position.

27:54.239 --> 27:55.614
One, two...

27:55.616 --> 27:57.024
This is it. One.

27:58.913 --> 28:00.322
Two.

28:07.232 --> 28:09.183
[Rajit's father]
Our son is a scientist too.

28:09.185 --> 28:11.103
[mother]
Rajit always did experiments.

28:11.105 --> 28:12.927
He was always top of his class.

28:12.929 --> 28:16.191
He researches
agricultural sustainability.

28:16.193 --> 28:18.238
Impressive.
I can't wait to meet him.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.223
He's considered an expert
on stinkweed.

28:20.225 --> 28:21.247
[Linda] Wow.

28:21.249 --> 28:22.815
[mother]
Such a diligent student.

28:22.817 --> 28:24.126
[father] Rajit.

28:24.128 --> 28:25.311
That's him?!

28:25.313 --> 28:27.231
That's the monkey hunter.

28:27.233 --> 28:28.735
Traditional family greeting.

28:28.737 --> 28:29.887
- [grunts]
- [clattering]

28:29.889 --> 28:31.458
Real mature, Rajit.

28:34.368 --> 28:35.871
That was pretty funny.

28:35.873 --> 28:38.014
[chuckles] Well, you know,
we met once before.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.649
On the train? I was on the roof.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.167
You gave me the last tea.

28:47.169 --> 28:48.352
From the Northeast.

28:54.593 --> 28:56.031
[laughter]

28:56.033 --> 28:58.366
How did you end up coming here?

28:58.368 --> 29:00.382
- Do you eat cows?
- Are you married?

29:00.384 --> 29:02.431
- No. Who has time for that?
- [laughter]

29:02.433 --> 29:04.191
Not that it... That it's always...

29:04.193 --> 29:07.774
She's taking time to think and
become more of her own person.

29:07.776 --> 29:08.926
[boy] Rajit is single though.

29:08.928 --> 29:11.901
[girl] Yeah, Sima ran up to
Delhi to be a cosmetologist.

29:11.903 --> 29:13.821
Yeah, and that was a win-win.

29:13.823 --> 29:16.383
That marriage was arranged
by the gods!

29:16.385 --> 29:18.174
But you young people
with your anxiety...

29:18.176 --> 29:20.032
[mocking]
...and your narcissism.

29:22.016 --> 29:23.999
- So, Rajit, you're a student?
- Yes.

29:24.001 --> 29:26.847
Well, he's working on his degree
in Agricultural Science.

29:26.849 --> 29:29.247
- [boy] Not anymore.
- I'm taking a sabbatical.

29:29.249 --> 29:31.774
- You know how it is.
- [chuckles] Absolutely.

29:31.776 --> 29:33.855
Reboot.
Come back with fresh eyes.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.010
Yes.

29:52.384 --> 29:53.985
That's a very sad story.

29:54.689 --> 29:56.513
- [Sita] Mm.
- But true.

29:57.632 --> 29:59.006
You can keep the guitar.

29:59.008 --> 30:01.022
- [Linda] Oh, I couldn't.
- Yeah.

30:01.024 --> 30:03.327
Some hippie left it
many years ago.

30:03.329 --> 30:06.207
It's just lost that...
patchouli smell.

30:06.209 --> 30:08.126
[Rajit] The British
stole the silverware,

30:08.128 --> 30:09.535
that's why we eat
with our hands.

30:09.537 --> 30:10.687
[Linda laughs]

30:10.689 --> 30:13.922
So, how does a scientist
get into seed sales?

30:15.232 --> 30:16.862
I don't know.

30:16.864 --> 30:19.262
- They sang me a song.
- Oh, yeah?

30:19.264 --> 30:20.317
Yeah.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.166
I think you're really gonna
like it here, doctor.

Hey.

30:24.959 --> 30:26.849
Welcome to my office.

- [Linda] It's very roomy.
- Mm-hm.

30:31.521 --> 30:32.766
You must be very important.

30:32.768 --> 30:34.305
Oh, very.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.422
[Rajit]
And then the stem-borers.

30:39.424 --> 30:40.477
They're like the piranhas
of the paddies.

30:40.479 --> 30:43.197
Yes, they can eat twice
their weight in six hours.

30:43.199 --> 30:44.926
I have nightmares
about those guys.

30:44.928 --> 30:46.911
But you know there is a ferbacia
that can kill it.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.509

- Wow, that is so weird.
- Yeah.

30:54.593 --> 30:57.470
I never met anybody
who likes weeds.

30:57.472 --> 30:59.393
What an unexpected night.

31:00.479 --> 31:02.751
[horn honks]

31:02.753 --> 31:06.238
- [Rajit chuckles]
- That's Aman. My ride.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.649
- Of course.
- Mm-hm.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.582
It was nice... re-meeting you.

31:11.584 --> 31:13.280
[laughs]

31:15.969 --> 31:19.295
You should stop by my lab.

31:19.297 --> 31:21.118
I'll show you my rice.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.974

Luckily, I have no end

31:46.464 --> 31:47.424
Don't move!

31:51.808 --> 31:53.310
Turns out I do have an end
to my self-esteem.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.039
[sighs]
I have negative air pressure

31:55.041 --> 31:57.918
to keep the foreign pollens out.
But those were pretty.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.391

31:59.393 --> 32:01.982

32:07.456 --> 32:10.687
No slides! I wish I had
some experience teaching.

32:10.689 --> 32:13.437
I'm supposed to win back
their hearts and minds.

32:13.439 --> 32:15.326
What does that even mean?

32:15.328 --> 32:17.726
Hmm. Wouldn't it be more poetic
if it was in a circle?

32:17.728 --> 32:20.480
You know, the endless
cycle of life kind of thing?

32:22.016 --> 32:23.744

have to grow outside.

That's why I'm here.
You invited me, remember?

33:16.641 --> 33:19.617
Wow. So this is what an American
rice paddy looks like.

33:21.599 --> 33:24.478
How come the life cycles are in
a line, not a circle?

33:24.480 --> 33:27.807
- I like when it's in a circle.
- Because this one's not.

33:27.809 --> 33:30.237

33:30.239 --> 33:32.125

to all newcomers.

Uh-uh. I'm pretty sure
it's just you.

- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

33:36.864 --> 33:39.645
Okay, well, then consider these
apology bananas.

- Okay, and I'll leave these...

Did you really hit

[Rajit] What we're talking about
is natural management.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.486
That means planting more
of my stinkweed,

35:43.488 --> 35:45.213
- and planting further apart.
- Ah.

35:45.215 --> 35:47.517
Plant less plants.
That does sound natural.

37:34.079 --> 37:35.805
I survived my presentation.

37:35.807 --> 37:37.759
You guys should stop by
and check it out

37:37.761 --> 37:39.329
before I take this show
on the road.

37:40.896 --> 37:41.886
[lows]

37:41.888 --> 37:45.022
So, any questions about rice,
just let me know.

37:45.024 --> 37:47.390
Did you know we've been farming
for over 5,000 years?

37:47.392 --> 37:49.822
[laughs] It just feels that way.

37:49.824 --> 37:51.774
- [animal grunts]
- That came out wrong.

37:51.776 --> 37:53.153
I'm just here to help.

37:54.176 --> 37:57.053
- Which is a great opportunity.
- Sure.

37:57.055 --> 37:59.486
Did you know in today's India
we're worth more

37:59.488 --> 38:00.893
than just, I don't know,
tech support

38:00.895 --> 38:02.493
for some screaming,
sobbing American

38:02.495 --> 38:03.902
who's erased their hard drives?

38:03.904 --> 38:06.654
- Mogil sent me here...
- Oh, the benevolent Mogil.

38:06.656 --> 38:08.701
You ever heard the phrase
a wolf in sheep's clothing?

38:08.703 --> 38:11.550
Yeah. It's a lot like a person
who pretends to be helpful

38:11.552 --> 38:13.213
and really they're just
screwing with somebody.

38:13.215 --> 38:14.301
You thought we had monkeys.

38:14.303 --> 38:15.517
Because you lied to me.

38:15.519 --> 38:18.173
If you weren't so self-involved
you would have remembered me

38:18.175 --> 38:19.773
from the train and you wouldn't
have fallen for it.

38:19.775 --> 38:21.950
Maybe you're not as memorable
as you think.

38:21.952 --> 38:23.902
Because so many men
are falling at your feet

38:23.904 --> 38:25.469
that you can't even remember
who they are.

38:25.471 --> 38:26.846
How can you be so vain?

38:26.848 --> 38:29.181
Wow, you're mad at me
because I don't remember you

38:29.183 --> 38:30.112
and I'm the one who's vain?

38:31.103 --> 38:32.064
Well...

38:33.503 --> 38:35.646
You thought we ate monkeys!

38:35.648 --> 38:36.545
[grunts]

38:41.152 --> 38:42.241
[grunts]

38:57.471 --> 38:59.006
[thunder rumbles]

38:59.008 --> 39:00.990
Aman, could you stop the car?

39:00.992 --> 39:02.334
[Linda] I feel like walking.

39:02.336 --> 39:03.486
[Aman] Walking?

39:03.488 --> 39:05.406
[Linda] I just want to look
at the stars.

39:05.408 --> 39:07.040

[farmer] Rajit, why is it
when you tell me

42:17.311 --> 42:20.637
not to sign the Mogil contract
I want to sign it more?

42:20.639 --> 42:22.206
- [all laughing]
- [Rajit] You're not listening.

42:22.208 --> 42:25.086
Look, with stinkweed my
rice harvest is gonna outweigh

42:25.088 --> 42:26.045
anything you've ever grown.

42:26.047 --> 42:28.573
You do know we've grown rice
for 5,000 years

42:28.575 --> 42:29.885
- around here, young man.
- Ha-ha-ha!

42:29.887 --> 42:31.806
We're talking about
a contest here, all right?

42:31.808 --> 42:34.046
At harvest time,
take equal sections

42:34.048 --> 42:35.933
of Linda's paddy field
and Rajit's field

42:35.935 --> 42:37.566
and weigh them
against each other.

42:37.568 --> 42:38.622
Biggest harvest wins.

42:38.624 --> 42:40.766
Look, you're gonna forget about
Rice Exchange Day,

42:40.768 --> 42:42.173
or Rice Nine or whatever,

42:42.175 --> 42:44.189
and you're gonna line up
to buy my stinkweed.

42:44.191 --> 42:45.982
Just keep your gossipy mouths
shut, okay?

42:45.984 --> 42:48.765
Oh, you're gonna keep it
a secret from your girlfriend?

42:48.767 --> 42:49.981
She's not his girlfriend.

42:49.983 --> 42:51.646
Okay, look, I'm gonna tell her,
all right?

42:51.648 --> 42:53.821
It's just, uh,
scientific protocol.

42:53.823 --> 42:55.040
- Oh.
- Scientific... [laughs]

42:56.511 --> 42:58.941
- Just shut up about it, okay?
- [farmer] Yeah, yeah, right.

42:58.943 --> 43:01.309
And if William pressures you
to sign...

43:01.311 --> 43:04.766
Tell him the stars aren't lucky
until after Diwali.

43:04.768 --> 43:08.093
Maybe he really did
learn something on vacation.

43:08.095 --> 43:10.814
Hmm, no point signing
the Mogil contracts

43:10.816 --> 43:12.541
until we see how this turns out.

43:12.543 --> 43:15.005
Ooh. An epic battle
for our affections.

43:15.007 --> 43:17.728
Let's spread the word. [laughs]

43:31.135 --> 43:35.072
[pop song plays]

43:58.016 --> 44:00.446
[Rajit] <i>It's me again.
Did anybody sign anything yet?</i>

44:00.448 --> 44:02.366
[man] <i>Dr. Watt is making sense.</i>

44:02.368 --> 44:03.711
And she speaks from the heart.

44:03.713 --> 44:05.886
[Rajit] <i>Please, I'm telling you
my stinkweed's gonna work.</i>

44:05.888 --> 44:08.061
Just give me until the harvest,
<i>and I'll prove it.</i>

44:08.063 --> 44:09.469
Don't sign those contracts.

44:09.471 --> 44:11.102
[Linda] It's nothing
to worry about, right?

44:11.104 --> 44:12.509
There's always the anomaly.

44:12.511 --> 44:13.856
Just one bad day.

44:21.568 --> 44:23.069
Congratulations, Rajit.

44:23.071 --> 44:25.344
Rice Paddy Radio
says nobody's signing.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.677
[Evelyn] <i>12 cities and bupkis.
Not a single contract signed.</i>

44:31.679 --> 44:32.606
This is bad.

44:32.608 --> 44:35.006
Are you hearing anything
on Rice Paddy Radio?

44:35.008 --> 44:35.968
Rice Paddy what?

44:36.575 --> 44:39.681
[pop song continues]

45:01.056 --> 45:03.901
It's Linda's office,
they have her on the line.

45:03.903 --> 45:07.326
Dr. Linda Watt.
I was just thinking about you.

45:07.328 --> 45:09.021
Sorry, it's William J. Patel.

45:09.023 --> 45:10.401
But I had to get through.

45:12.128 --> 45:13.438
[Gurgon] Lapel.

45:13.440 --> 45:14.334
<i>It's Patel.</i>

45:14.336 --> 45:16.669
You're even handsomer
than I'd imagined.

45:16.671 --> 45:17.854
What's up?

45:17.856 --> 45:19.805
<i>Actually, it's about
that wonder rice of yours,</i>

45:19.807 --> 45:22.142
the rice that produces no seed.

45:22.144 --> 45:23.516
- Lapel.
- <i>Patel.</i>

45:23.518 --> 45:25.054
Rice is a seed.

45:25.056 --> 45:26.814
About that contract of yours...

45:26.816 --> 45:28.286
I had to read the fine print
three times

45:28.288 --> 45:30.686
before I could understand
the implications.

45:30.688 --> 45:32.574
Implications?

45:32.576 --> 45:37.085
Once you take their rice,
they're trapped... by yours.

45:37.087 --> 45:39.005
<i>And you have the farmers
lining up for it,</i>

45:39.007 --> 45:40.670
thanks to Linda's passion.

45:40.672 --> 45:43.198
- Now Lapel...
- My name is Patel.

45:43.200 --> 45:46.973
I know it's your instinct
to shout those implications

45:46.975 --> 45:49.533
from the top of
the tallest pagoda.

45:49.535 --> 45:51.329
Linda has no idea, does she?

45:52.288 --> 45:54.589
- <i>Scotch, is it?</i>
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

45:54.591 --> 45:56.669
<i>Royal Salute,
is that your drink?</i>

45:56.671 --> 45:57.952
- Uh...
- [knocking]

46:00.831 --> 46:03.391
[Gurgon] <i>Berg, he takes it
on the rocks.</i>

46:07.808 --> 46:09.533
<i>Nice, isn't it?</i>

46:09.535 --> 46:12.605
As it happens,
you called at a most...

46:12.607 --> 46:14.300
They're on the line, MG.

46:14.302 --> 46:16.285
Auspicious moment.

46:16.287 --> 46:17.183
Are you with us, Geneva?

46:18.687 --> 46:20.989
- [men speak French]
- Are you with us, London?

46:20.991 --> 46:22.206
- [men greet]
- Berlin.

46:22.208 --> 46:24.478
- [men speak German]
- Alan Wood.

46:24.480 --> 46:25.820
<i>Good morning.</i>

46:25.822 --> 46:27.645
[Gurgon] Hello, Uncle Gene.

46:27.647 --> 46:29.281
<i>Are you with us, Lapel?</i>

46:30.719 --> 46:33.533
Well, I'm listening but I'm not
<i>with anybody, just...</i>

46:33.535 --> 46:35.069
<i>Don't be coy.</i>

46:35.071 --> 46:38.014
You called.
A rupee for your thoughts.

46:38.016 --> 46:40.445
Well, to be honest,
I'm not so sure the farmers

46:40.447 --> 46:42.590
will be able to pay for the seed
<i>year after year.</i>

46:42.592 --> 46:45.566
Well, if they don't have cash,
there are other ways to pay.

46:45.568 --> 46:47.422
Land, for example.

46:47.424 --> 46:50.398
I mean, why should farmers
have to worry about owning land.

01:05:23.391 --> 01:05:25.183

01:05:56.573 --> 01:05:58.429
[Rajit] You're a really
fast runner.

01:05:58.431 --> 01:06:00.125
Did you like the flowers?

01:06:00.127 --> 01:06:02.044
I did. How did you grow
the stinkweed?

01:06:02.046 --> 01:06:04.285
Hey, how about we talk about
something not serious

01:06:04.287 --> 01:06:06.748
- for 30 seconds, okay? Please.

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:10.428
It's funny, I know India
is this huge country

01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:13.533
but to me it's just...
the train.

01:06:13.535 --> 01:06:15.709
[laughs] The farm towns.

01:06:15.711 --> 01:06:17.405
Yeah, there's still lots to see,
you know.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:19.741
There's Khelar... uh, Bernasi.

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:22.044
My God,
Punjab is just beautiful.

01:06:22.046 --> 01:06:23.963
- The Taj Mahal.
- Taj Mahal?

01:06:23.965 --> 01:06:27.420
No, I hate the Taj Mahal.
Do not go there.

01:06:27.422 --> 01:06:29.756
How can you hate the Taj Mahal?

01:06:29.758 --> 01:06:31.196
- How can I...
- [laughs]

01:06:31.198 --> 01:06:32.635
Do you know Shah Jahan
cut off the hands

01:06:32.637 --> 01:06:35.005
of the 20,000 craftsmen
who built the Taj Mahal

01:06:35.007 --> 01:06:36.924
so they would never create
anything beautiful ever again.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:38.206
I will never set foot in there.

01:06:40.351 --> 01:06:42.943
You're cute when you're
righteously indignant.

01:06:47.518 --> 01:06:48.735
I know.

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:51.869
[Linda] Since we were talking
about sightseeing...

01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:53.276
[Rajit] Mm-hm?

01:06:53.278 --> 01:06:55.196
[Linda] Am I allowed
in the temple?

01:06:55.198 --> 01:06:57.500
[Rajit] We've got so many gods
we can't keep track

01:06:57.502 --> 01:06:59.996
of who's allowed.
Come on, I'll show you.

01:06:59.998 --> 01:07:02.268
There's so much music here.

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:04.348
People are dancing, singing.

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:06.620
And then the farmers,
they'll take a small portion

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:09.149
of their seed, and they'll
put it in a bowl like this

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:10.876
- as an offering.
- Do they circle around it?

01:07:10.878 --> 01:07:12.827
Yes, exactly.
It's an ancient tradition.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:15.292
It's like the growth cycle,
and the bowl is like the world

01:07:15.294 --> 01:07:16.319
offering up its...

01:07:17.247 --> 01:07:18.652
- I don't know.
- [chuckles]

01:07:18.654 --> 01:07:21.403
I hope they don't stop
doing the ceremony.

01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:22.591
It would be a shame.

01:07:23.646 --> 01:07:26.203
- Oh, here.
- What's this?

01:07:26.205 --> 01:07:27.804
Oh, a promotional
rice seed packet.

01:07:27.806 --> 01:07:29.340
Wow, that's what
I always wanted.

01:07:29.342 --> 01:07:30.687

01:07:36.413 --> 01:07:38.044
- Monkey seeds.
- Mm-hm. [laughs]

01:07:38.046 --> 01:07:39.964
I knew Mogil
was up to something.

01:07:39.966 --> 01:07:41.532
[laughs]

01:07:41.534 --> 01:07:44.091
What is that head wiggle
that Indians do?

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:45.084
Hm?

01:07:45.086 --> 01:07:46.684
Does it mean yes, no, maybe?

01:07:46.686 --> 01:07:49.472
Exactly. Come on, try it.

01:07:50.943 --> 01:07:52.187
No.

01:07:52.189 --> 01:07:53.724

- No. Wow, that's horrible.

01:07:53.726 --> 01:07:56.189

Okay.

Mm-hm. Yeah, that's it.

were some corporate stooge

01:08:10.685 --> 01:08:13.307

of these farmers.

horrible for no good reason.

Not anymore. You don't plant
the rice that you harvest.

01:11:31.647 --> 01:11:33.660

Rice Nine seed.

to buy from Mogil
