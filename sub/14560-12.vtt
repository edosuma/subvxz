00:07.741 --> 00:10.511
* Hey! I ain't freaking,
I ain't faking this *

00:10.544 --> 00:12.746
* I ain't freaking, I ain't
faking this *

00:12.780 --> 00:15.083
* I ain't freaking,
I ain't faking this *

00:15.116 --> 00:17.551
* Shut up and let me go!
Hey! *

00:18.619 --> 00:19.753
Welcome to Hollywood, folks.

00:19.787 --> 00:23.057
Please, watch your step
when you get up on the bus.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.959
Breaking a leg here
does not mean good luck.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.361
This blows.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.430
At least the hotel
had video games.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.700
You've shot enough
mutants today.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.702
- This is going to be fun.
- What can you do?

00:34.735 --> 00:37.004
How you doing, buddy?
Put a smile on that face.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.239
Hope your AC's working.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.074
Better in the back.
Nice shirt. I like that.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.376
Hi. Welcome to
Hollywood. Hey. Whoa!

00:42.410 --> 00:44.378
You all right there, buddy?
I said, watch your step.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.880
Little too much partying last
night, huh? Oh, yeah?

00:46.914 --> 00:48.916
What, he got his whole
suitcase in there?

00:48.949 --> 00:50.484
Oh, we're staying
at a hostel downtown.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.520
We don't want anyone
walking away with our stuff.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.922
All right, have a good
time, have a good time.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.790
Put your stuff up
in the racks up top.

00:56.824 --> 00:57.791
Hi. How are you?

00:57.825 --> 01:00.060
* I ain't freaking,
I ain't faking this... *

01:00.094 --> 01:01.162
I hope
you brought your cameras.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.430
The next two hours,

01:02.463 --> 01:04.965
we are gonna be hitting
all the hot spots, people.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.334
* Shut up and let me go!
Hey! *

01:06.367 --> 01:09.470
Sunset Strip, Walk of Fame,
tour of the stars' homes,

01:09.503 --> 01:12.173
and an excursion
down Rodeo Drive,

01:12.206 --> 01:14.475
and that, people,
is for the very attractive lady

01:14.508 --> 01:16.477
in the lavender sweater
in the back.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.978
All right, who's having fun?

01:18.011 --> 01:19.079
Are you having fun?

01:19.113 --> 01:21.249
All right,
don't have too much fun now.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.717
Sit back, relax,
have a beverage...

01:23.751 --> 01:24.718
Is your friend okay?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.954
Yeah, he's fine.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.656
He doesn't like crowds.

01:28.689 --> 01:29.957
DRIVER:
...to the Enquirer, old Roy here

01:29.990 --> 01:31.592
gets ten percent.
I take checks.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.194
Take a look
over on your right side.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.028
It's our first stop.
It's the world-famous

01:35.062 --> 01:38.432
Kodak Theatre,
home of the Oscars.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.935
Go! All right, everybody,
just stay calm.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.604
Keep your eyes forward.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.139
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- And shut up!

01:45.173 --> 01:46.740
Driver, you just keep driving.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.142
Just keep driving.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.110
Do not look at us.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.113
Keep your eyes forward.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.916
My associate is
coming down the aisle.

01:55.949 --> 02:01.422
I want you to put all keys,
wallets, cameras, cell phones,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.056
everything
into the bag.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.992
If it's our money
you want, take it.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.095
What? Did I say you could talk?

02:08.128 --> 02:09.129
We don't want
your money.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.097
You don't need
to do that.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.365
What are you gonna do about it?

02:11.399 --> 02:13.367
You gonna stop me?
Huh? I don't think so.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.203
You shut up.
Everybody, shut up!

02:15.236 --> 02:19.072
Do not speak
unless you're spoken to.

02:19.106 --> 02:23.311
All right, driver,
turn off the AC.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.278
Turn up the heat.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.481
And make a next right
down the alley.

02:27.515 --> 02:30.818
* ...kiss my lips, now shut up
and let me go! Hey! *

02:30.851 --> 02:32.152
DAVID:
Dispatcher received

02:32.186 --> 02:33.787
a panic button call
20 minutes ago

02:33.821 --> 02:35.823
from one of the company's
sightseeing buses.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.124
Now, they radioed
the driver.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.158
Guy's not
responding.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.261
With a busload full
of missing tourists,

02:40.294 --> 02:41.429
they called us.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.197
Agent Don Eppes,
this is, uh, Len Walsh.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.365
Hey.
How you doing?

02:44.398 --> 02:45.566
I've been better.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.935
I'm the head of security
for HollywoodLine Tours.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.237
I really appreciate
you coming.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.638
So, what can you tell me?

02:50.671 --> 02:51.439
Nothing really, except,

02:51.472 --> 02:52.506
we've got smart-VIT,

02:52.540 --> 02:53.874
vehicle immobilization
technology.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.143
It's a GPS-based

02:56.176 --> 02:57.411
anti-hijacking
software.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.046
Designed to stop a bus remotely.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.315
Right. After 9/11,
we installed it in all

03:01.349 --> 03:03.183
of our buses to
prevent terrorists

03:03.217 --> 03:05.185
from stealing one
and turning it into a weapon.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.854
DAVID:
From here, they can access

03:06.887 --> 03:07.355
the bus's onboard computer,

03:07.388 --> 03:09.189
hit the kill switch,
shut it down remotely.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.091
All right, good.
So, how long does this take?

03:11.124 --> 03:12.059
Well, we're ready now.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.962
(beep)

03:19.400 --> 03:20.768
They're on 4th going east.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.070
DON: All right, stay close now,
all right?

03:23.103 --> 03:26.607
LEN: GPS is feeding us real-time
data.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.808
Looks like
they're heading downtown.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.243
Somebody's trying
to make a statement.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.411
They've picked
the perfect place.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.146
You got City Hall,
financial district,

03:33.180 --> 03:34.482
half a dozen schools,
churches, synagogues.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.016
It's max headlines
and casualties.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.118
Let's go. Let's get
everyone moving.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.320
Still heading east,
approaching Union.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.154
MAN:
SWAT's here.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.756
My units are rolling.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.224
(beeping)

03:44.258 --> 03:45.826
- DON: What have we got here?
- I'm in.

03:45.859 --> 03:46.660
SWAT units,

03:46.694 --> 03:47.628
move into position.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.230
Prepare to intercept
at Cahuenga tunnel.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.999
Roger that.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.605
(indistinct radio transmission)

03:57.638 --> 04:00.207
MAN:
Stand by. We're ready to do it.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.309
(computer chirping)

04:01.342 --> 04:03.110
All right, kill it.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.645
(beeping)

04:04.678 --> 04:07.681
COLBY:
He's slowing down, Don.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.384
(beeping)

04:10.418 --> 04:12.520
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:15.923 --> 04:17.625
(beep)

04:17.658 --> 04:19.627
What's going on?
Why did it stop?

04:19.660 --> 04:21.261
They've overridden the system.

04:21.295 --> 04:24.565
I'm... I'm locked out.
I can't stop it.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.200
It's picking up speed.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.802
They're gonna blow
right through 'em!

04:30.003 --> 04:32.506
Get the hell out of there!
Go! Go! Back down! Go!

04:38.211 --> 04:39.347
(tires squealing)

04:47.788 --> 04:50.190
(siren blaring)

04:50.223 --> 04:51.859
Colby, you stand down.
SWAT's got it.

04:51.892 --> 04:52.960
(siren blaring)

04:57.331 --> 05:00.033
One of our vehicles has eyes
on the back of the bus.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.234
Switchboard.

05:01.268 --> 05:05.105
There's a guy asking for the
lead agent in charge, line one.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.273
(beep)

05:06.306 --> 05:08.208
This is Eppes.
Who's this?

05:08.241 --> 05:10.110
18 hostages.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.246
We want $18 million.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.350
And you can tell that guy next
to you works at the bus company

05:16.384 --> 05:18.018
to call his banker.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.788
You have until 7:00.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.359
That gives us
four hours.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.045
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my God.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.213
- Oh.
- What's that smell?

05:46.246 --> 05:47.381
Oh, dear.
(sighs)

05:47.415 --> 05:48.449
What is that?

05:48.482 --> 05:50.884
The malodor seems to be
emanating from the dining room.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.020
Yes, yes, yes. Hold on,
hold on. Excuse me.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.923
Ah, no. That's not the only
place it's coming from, Dad.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.825
- You smell like...
- Cow manure puree?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.394
Uh-huh. I know, it's, uh...
it's bad.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.729
I had to move
it inside.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.896
The neighbors were complaining.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.065
The road to progress is paved
with naysayers.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.534
Progress?

06:06.567 --> 06:07.735
I'm doing research
for our think tank.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.571
I read about this project
at MIT. Engineers

06:10.604 --> 06:12.540
added cow manure
to a bucket of charcoal.

06:12.573 --> 06:13.941
The idea was
to generate enough

06:13.974 --> 06:17.244
electricity to power
a cell phone for almost a year.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.512
CHARLIE:
Well, you didn't use our blender

06:18.546 --> 06:19.913
to do this, did you?

06:19.947 --> 06:20.848
Oh, Charlie, please.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.050
As much as I applaud
your endeavor here,

06:23.083 --> 06:25.619
I don't think that this falls
within the purview

06:25.653 --> 06:27.655
of our intended enterprise.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.722
Meaning?

06:28.756 --> 06:32.460
Scientific method is based
on theoretical inquiry,

06:32.493 --> 06:34.595
followed by brute force
experimentation.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.597
I fear that
we are putting

06:36.630 --> 06:38.131
the laboratory of the ladle

06:38.165 --> 06:40.501
before the laboratory
of the mind.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.903
Yeah, I think if we're going
to improve the world,

06:42.936 --> 06:45.038
we should work
from the ground up, hmm?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.307
You're the team leader, Charlie?
What do you think?

06:47.340 --> 06:48.809
(phone ringing)
No? Okay. Sorry.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.779
Hey, Don.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.980
(coughs)

06:53.013 --> 06:54.582
Yeah, I'll be right there.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.450
Okay, now, if we just turn...

06:59.820 --> 07:03.323
COLBY: So, we're keeping eyes on
the bus.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.358
I mean, where
is the guy headed, you know?

07:05.392 --> 07:06.927
Nowhere. It just keeps
looping around downtown.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.295
Right. For what?

07:08.328 --> 07:10.397
I mean, he's smart enough to
beat the bus company's system.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.632
He's got to
have something.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.467
Did we figure out how he
overrode the kill switch yet?

07:13.501 --> 07:14.768
I'm waiting on Charlie.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.873
(tires squealing)

07:22.843 --> 07:24.645
AGENT:
Southbound on Ivar.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.146
CHARLIE:
Based on the analysis,

07:26.179 --> 07:29.617
I'd say they defeated
the anti-hijacking system

07:29.650 --> 07:30.818
the old-fashioned way.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.520
- And what's that?
- They hacked in.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.522
When we installed
smart-VIT on our buses,

07:34.555 --> 07:36.557
we were told
that it was unhackable.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.926
Nothing's unhackable,
and the truth is,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.594
you know, you gave them
the key to the front door

07:40.628 --> 07:41.895
when your tech Jeff
accessed the system.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.897
They were waiting,
they tapped

07:43.931 --> 07:45.365
into the bus's
onboard computer.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.400
They were ready to
steal the PIN password

07:47.434 --> 07:48.569
with a decryption algorithm.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.203
All right,
that's how they got in.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.572
How did they lock us out?

07:51.605 --> 07:53.073
They changed the password.
They altered the PIN.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.242
Well, the question is:
Can we get back in?

07:55.275 --> 07:56.544
I mean, can we stop the bus?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.679
Yeah. Like I said,
anything can be hacked.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.447
Just let me go
talk to Amita.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.682
This is a number
theory problem.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.084
Well, you got three
and a half hours.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.761
LEN:
Think he can pull it off?

08:13.794 --> 08:16.063
Well, if not,
we'll go to Plan B.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.264
What's that?

08:17.297 --> 08:19.600
I'll let you know
when I know.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.836
Don, line one.
It's our guy.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.004
All right.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.205
Put on the speaker.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.439
(beep)

08:26.473 --> 08:27.708
This is Eppes.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.777
I see cops in my rear-view.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.211
You really think
we wouldn't follow you?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.680
What's the status of the money?

08:32.713 --> 08:34.214
We're working on it.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.216
Oh, let me guess.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.618
You need more time.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.186
Four hours isn't enough.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.388
Yeah, well, it's a lot of cash
you're asking for.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.391
Let me make one thing clear,
okay?

08:44.424 --> 08:46.594
For every minute past 7:00,

08:46.627 --> 08:48.829
I will kill
one hostage.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.699
Of course, the price per head
goes down, too.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.066
If the company wants

08:53.100 --> 08:55.803
to negotiate down to zero,
that's their decision.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.337
DON:
Okay, I'll let them know,

08:57.370 --> 08:58.572
but you got
to give me something.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.074
Proof that the hostages
are unharmed?

09:01.108 --> 09:02.576
That's right.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.476
Hold this.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.578
Come here. Come here.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.647
No. Please.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.681
Come here. Talk to him...

09:07.715 --> 09:09.182
Talk to him!
Come on.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.418
WOMAN:
I've got a son.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.686
Give 'em what they want.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.722
(imitating crying):
Give 'em what they want.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.924
You have until 7:00.

09:16.957 --> 09:17.891
(beep)

09:17.925 --> 09:20.728
This guy is reading
from our playbook.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.362
I hope Plan B is good.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.364
You're never gonna
believe this.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.299
We've got eyes
in the bus.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.735
Oh, yeah?

09:27.768 --> 09:30.738
DON: So, where are we getting
this from?

09:30.771 --> 09:33.941
Miami PD. There's a guy
on the bus named Jack Shuler.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.442
Miami narcotics.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.844
He's on vacation.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.679
DON: He picked the wrong bus,
huh?

09:38.712 --> 09:40.447
Ten minutes ago,
he made a video call

09:40.480 --> 09:41.749
from his cell phone
to his squad,

09:41.782 --> 09:43.851
started streaming
a live feed.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.754
Guy's got guts.
Images are degraded.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.690
It's slowing down
facial recognition.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.892
What was that thing that
Charlie did with the...

09:51.925 --> 09:53.627
You remember, the
face in the mirror?

09:53.661 --> 09:54.928
Diffeomorphic matching?

09:54.962 --> 09:55.963
Nice.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.164
I pay attention.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.231
We're using it.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.332
And as soon as
we got faces,

09:59.366 --> 10:00.801
we'll run 'em against
fed and local databases.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.636
And obviously, the bus
company, too, right?

10:02.670 --> 10:03.971
So, you're thinking...
(phone buzzes)

10:04.004 --> 10:06.573
...someone in this crew knows
more than they should

10:06.606 --> 10:08.275
about the company's
anti-hijacking system?

10:09.877 --> 10:11.544
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.913
I'm just
supposed to fly

10:12.946 --> 10:15.348
to Denver tomorrow
to meet with the ADIC there.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.483
Well, for what?

10:16.516 --> 10:17.550
Supervisor.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.019
Organized crime unit.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.020
They're looking
to fill the post

10:20.053 --> 10:21.889
- by the end of the month.
- Huh?

10:21.922 --> 10:24.758
It's a huge opportunity.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.860
I'm gonna go find Walsh
and let him know

10:26.894 --> 10:29.629
we're gonna need
his company files.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.702
(siren blaring)

10:37.070 --> 10:39.506
This hacker
knows what he's doing.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.708
128-bit
encryption key.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.542
He's definitely not
making our lives easy.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.777
Perhaps an application

10:43.811 --> 10:45.846
of Shor's algorithm
might be in order here.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.682
Yeah, that's next
if this doesn't work.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.784
Am I interrupting anything?

10:50.818 --> 10:51.785
Just attempting to rescue

10:51.819 --> 10:53.721
a busload of tourists
being held at gunpoint

10:53.754 --> 10:55.122
by four men demanding
$18 million.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.589
That's all.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.191
Unfortunately, he's not joking.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.526
Clearly, you have
more pressing matters,

10:59.559 --> 11:02.462
but I just wanted to mention
that I stopped by Galuski's

11:02.495 --> 11:03.596
engineering class
for a chat,

11:03.630 --> 11:04.698
and, uh, he's on board

11:04.732 --> 11:06.166
with the cow manure
fuel cell idea.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.702
Okay, well, I had
a similarly spirited discussion

11:08.736 --> 11:10.137
with Brecker in astrophysics.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.540
He suggested we better model
our efforts after Paul Davies'

11:13.573 --> 11:15.843
Cosmic Think Tank
at Arizona State.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.711
Well, that's a bit head-
in-the-clouds, don't you think?

11:17.745 --> 11:19.546
What, as opposed
to poo on the table?

11:19.579 --> 11:20.914
Guys, this isn't the time.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.952
DAVID:
We got a hit

11:24.985 --> 11:27.487
off your employee
database.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.688
Phil Craypo.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.357
Mechanic, terminated
three months ago

11:30.390 --> 11:32.159
for using drugs
on the job.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.161
Does he know about
the smart-VIT system?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.495
Man takes buses apart

11:35.528 --> 11:36.764
and then puts them
back together.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.865
He knows enough.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.299
File says you're
the one who fired him.

11:39.332 --> 11:44.104
I fire a lot of people
when they don't do their jobs.

11:44.137 --> 11:44.905
Excuse me.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.373
Uh, this is Caitlin Dawes.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.640
Her fiancГ©
is on the bus.

11:47.674 --> 11:48.876
Jack Shuler.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.778
Works for Miami PD.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.980
Why don't you just tell
us how you found out.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.882
Well, uh,
Jack texted me.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.383
He told me he
was gonna find

11:56.416 --> 11:58.451
a way to get word
to the FBI.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.820
Is he okay?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.288
You know, we can't
really discuss

12:01.321 --> 12:02.622
an open case; I'm sorry.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.057
I understand.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.625
Is there anyone
you can stay with?

12:05.658 --> 12:07.694
Jack and I are on vacation.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.030
We're in L.A.
for the day.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.666
We're supposed to get married
this weekend in Vegas.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.269
This morning, I told him
I didn't want to go.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.205
I hate touristy crap.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.440
It's gonna be okay...
(cell phone buzzing)

12:20.473 --> 12:21.809
- right?
- Warner.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.944
Charlie's hacked the hack.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.446
DON:
Hey, so...

12:26.479 --> 12:27.447
DAVID:
They're heading toward

12:27.480 --> 12:28.515
Van Nuys Airport right now.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.649
WALSH:
Escape plan, maybe.

12:29.682 --> 12:30.984
Helicopter, small plane.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.853
DAVID: We have Charlie on
videoconference.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.021
Oh, hey, Charlie, we good?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.923
I'm ready. Just say the word.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.925
Okay, the most direct route
is this access road

12:37.958 --> 12:39.793
right here. If can stop them
there, isolate them,

12:39.827 --> 12:41.594
maybe the snipers
can get a good look.

12:41.628 --> 12:42.963
All right, good,
so tell Colby and King

12:42.996 --> 12:43.964
- to meet me there, all right?
- Okay.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.165
Charlie, I'll
see you later.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.466
Yeah, later.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.285
What are you
looking at, huh?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.021
Get up, get up.

13:10.190 --> 13:14.995
Come on. Get him down here.
Get him down here.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.830
Sit down,
sit down.

13:16.864 --> 13:17.831
Sit down here.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.499
Sit there.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.500
Keep an eye on him here.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.434
Keep an eye on him.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.506
Looks like David's hunch
was right.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.875
They're coming
right to us.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.176
My boys are set.
Snipers are in position.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.510
We're good
to go, fellas.

13:40.954 --> 13:41.889
DAVID:
Don.

13:41.922 --> 13:42.956
He's on line one.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.791
DON:
All right, put it through.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.792
(beep)

13:45.825 --> 13:46.793
Eppes.

13:46.826 --> 13:47.861
Sounds like you're outside.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.696
What, are you taking
a lunch break?

13:49.729 --> 13:50.898
What's on the menu?

13:50.931 --> 13:51.932
Whatever you want.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.101
BUCKLEY:
Four duffel bags, equal splits.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.904
50s and 100s-- no marked bills,

13:56.937 --> 13:59.806
no new bills, and no
consecutive serial numbers.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.775
And no little surprises
inside the duffel bags.

14:02.809 --> 14:03.877
Okay, where do you want it?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.178
You'll know soon enough.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.116
(siren blaring)

14:10.483 --> 14:11.251
Okay, here they come.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.086
Any luck, we end
this thing right now.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.256
Okay, I'm in.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.096
COLBY: Don, we got to hit that
kill switch.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.064
Charlie?

14:25.332 --> 14:26.333
We gotta pull
the kill switch, Don.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.035
You better get out of there.
Pull it.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.502
Charlie, pull the switch!

14:29.536 --> 14:31.671
(beeping)

14:31.704 --> 14:34.074
(brakes squeaking)

14:39.146 --> 14:40.347
What are you doing, Eppes?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.514
We need to talk.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.917
No, you need to listen!

14:45.685 --> 14:47.087
(brakes scraping)

14:54.461 --> 14:56.063
BUCKLEY:
Back off.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.565
Restart the engine
or you're gonna hear a sound

14:58.598 --> 15:00.968
that you'll never forget.
(woman screaming)

15:01.001 --> 15:02.435
You hear that, huh?

15:02.469 --> 15:03.937
WOMAN:
Stop, stop!

15:03.971 --> 15:05.438
Please, no!

15:05.472 --> 15:07.207
- How many, Eppes, huh?
- Turn around!

15:07.240 --> 15:09.409
How many is acceptable
to you, Eppes, huh?

15:09.442 --> 15:10.944
Two, seven?

15:10.978 --> 15:11.945
Is it gonna be ten?

15:11.979 --> 15:13.713
Zero-- we got to take the shot.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.714
We don't have a visual.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.583
Well, give me one minute.
My guys will get thermal.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.318
We don't have a minute.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.120
I don't hear anything...
I don't hear anything!

15:20.153 --> 15:22.122
I'll take that as an answer.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.923
- All right!
- I'm a cop!

15:23.957 --> 15:24.992
SHULER:
All right?

15:25.025 --> 15:27.327
I'm worth more to you
than anyone else here.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.062
Take me.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.802
I got one of your own, Eppes.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.037
I got a cop.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.976
Give me back my bus.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.318
Come here.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.252
Just sit down.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.087
We got a cop on board.
You feel safe?

15:54.121 --> 15:55.088
DON: All right, hold on.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.189
Hold on. Let's just relax.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.924
Let's just slow
things down, okay?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.659
You give me my bus,

15:59.692 --> 16:01.328
or I give you
a body bag.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.730
DON: Well, it's gonna take us
some time to restart it.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.765
(laughs) I'm not stupid.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.766
No, I know that.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.934
I want those
people alive.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.136
You want
your money.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.437
We both have a stake.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.471
I just need some time.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.407
How long?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.409
I got to get someone
working on it.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.011
You got an hour.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.047
And so does he.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.718
Hey, where
are you going?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.087
To talk to my boss.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.555
You're going
to advise him to pay?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.557
Anything happens on
that bus, it's on me.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.560
I want those 18 people to
go home to their families.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.894
Listen, so do I.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.496
We don't know anything
about these guys.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.831
Say we let the bus go,
you guys pay up.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.067
Who's to guarantee they won't

16:40.100 --> 16:41.334
kill them anyway?

16:41.368 --> 16:43.203
As long as we have eyes
on the bus,

16:43.236 --> 16:44.271
those people have a chance.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.739
And what if this turns
into Waco?

16:50.410 --> 16:52.212
KING: If we're gonna insert,
we're gonna have

16:52.245 --> 16:53.780
to take them out first.

16:53.813 --> 16:54.847
DON: Well, does anyone have a
shot?

16:54.881 --> 16:55.948
That's a negative.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.984
No, they got
the heat cranked up,

16:58.017 --> 16:59.786
and low-level jamming
to kill eavesdropping.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.921
So, we're flying blind.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.490
You know, last time,
your brother did some

17:03.523 --> 17:05.825
pretty serious magic
with thermal signatures.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.161
Think he's got anything
in his bag of tricks for this?

17:08.195 --> 17:09.296
So, what do you think?

17:09.329 --> 17:11.364
CHARLIE: I think world peace has
a better chance

17:11.398 --> 17:12.665
at happening in 60 minutes.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.534
It's more like 54.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.368
No pressure.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.937
These guys have covered
their bases here.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.372
They... they have the edge.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.941
We have an edge they don't
know about, Charlie: the video.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.976
CHARLIE:
Yeah, that's true.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.079
Maybe I could use
a Voxel-based 3-D capture.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.315
I created a CAD program

17:28.348 --> 17:30.783
for the architecture department
last year.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.386
It allows designers to see
what a space will look like

17:33.420 --> 17:36.022
from different angles,
using different floor plans.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.358
Now, as the observer
and the objects move around,

17:38.391 --> 17:43.396
the CAD algorithm calculates
light, shadow and perspective.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.298
Working backwards,
those same elements

17:45.332 --> 17:47.066
can provide
the exact measurement

17:47.100 --> 17:50.137
of an object's location
down to the millimeter.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.038
So, I could use
the streamed video

17:52.071 --> 17:54.607
and the, uh...
the bus manufacturer's specs,

17:54.641 --> 17:58.878
and I could run a CAD program
on the bus's interior.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.147
So, the bus becomes the room.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.581
And the bad guys,
the furniture in it.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.450
And that algorithm
should give the snipers

18:03.483 --> 18:04.784
the targeting data they need.

18:04.817 --> 18:05.752
All right, do it.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.563
Suppose it's no
use asking.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.698
It was a mistake
coming down here.

18:18.731 --> 18:19.999
If I were
in your shoes,

18:20.032 --> 18:21.468
I would have done
the same thing.

18:21.501 --> 18:24.404
It's not like I don't
know the drill.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.706
Watching them go out the door,

18:26.739 --> 18:29.509
knowing that may be
the last time you see them.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.715
Two days away
from getting married.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.419
Do you think I'll ever
be a cop's wife?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.421
We're doing everything we can.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.862
KING:
Shut out, no communication.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.465
All we got is this crap video
from this guy's cell phone.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.700
I say, as soon as
Charlie's ready,

18:53.733 --> 18:56.303
- we go in and we take him out.
- We can't, not till we know

18:56.336 --> 18:58.338
what he's after. He's got guns
on 18 people,

18:58.371 --> 18:59.872
holding us up
for 18 million bucks.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.441
What more do you
need to know?

19:01.474 --> 19:03.676
I'm with Don on this one.
It doesn't make any sense.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.245
We don't know
what the endgame is.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.513
It always ends
the same.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.415
They ask for a
police car, they ask

19:08.448 --> 19:10.383
for a chopper,
escort to the airport.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.252
The longer we wait, the
more time we give them.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.920
We take the shot,
everybody goes home.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.355
Yeah, well, what
if they don't?

19:15.388 --> 19:16.689
DON:
Look, we're waiting.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.090
We're waiting.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.392
All right, fine,
you make the call.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.693
We all got
to live with it.

19:20.727 --> 19:21.761
Yeah, my call.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.898
AMITA:
How is it going?

19:25.932 --> 19:27.467
I'm almost there.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.270
You know the situation
is deteriorating, right?

19:30.303 --> 19:32.372
My 3-D capture
will be done in time.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.607
No, I'm talking
about Larry and Alan.

19:34.641 --> 19:37.377
I just saw them nearly come
to blows at the cafe.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.511
Look, I realize
that we

19:38.545 --> 19:39.512
have bigger issues
right now,

19:39.546 --> 19:41.113
but you do get
that at some point,

19:41.147 --> 19:42.949
you yourself are gonna have
to step in.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.251
They're grown men.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.619
Just because they're not
acting like it...

19:46.653 --> 19:47.520
Means you have to.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.956
Look, Charlie, we both know
that Larry is depressed

19:49.989 --> 19:52.725
about the CERN collider and the
freeze on our Higgs research.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.728
And your dad... well,
he's just being your dad.

19:55.762 --> 19:58.097
Well, I'm not gonna
take sides, Amita.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.166
Who elected me
team leader anyway?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.401
They did.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.703
Don't look at me.
I voted for myself.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.572
(sighs)

20:05.605 --> 20:06.639
Bull's-eye.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.410
All right, I got IDs
on the rest of our crew.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.444
Craypo is the mechanic.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.746
You already know about him.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.249
Our alpha is John Buckley.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.318
He's pulled mostly
high-end robberies,

20:18.351 --> 20:19.952
jewelry store heists, bank jobs.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.087
Next up is

20:21.120 --> 20:22.522
Andrew Hays. Drug-runner.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.791
He worked as a pilot
for the Colombians.

20:24.824 --> 20:25.592
There you go.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.593
There's the airport theory.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.461
And our hacker is Victor Kirov.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.529
Now, he's one of the best.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.031
Aside from being caught,
he's top-notch.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.134
Good news: none of these guys
has a history of violence.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.236
Bad news is there's
always a first time.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.938
Any idea how these guys
are connected?

20:38.971 --> 20:40.307
Well, they're not, Don.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.508
I mean, their arrest records

20:41.541 --> 20:43.410
read like a travelogue,
all over the country.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.312
Haven't been able to find
a common denominator.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.613
With a crew like this,

20:46.646 --> 20:47.580
these guys, they don't
hook up over MySpace.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.449
What about Charlie?
What's he got?

20:49.482 --> 20:50.817
I spoke to him
about five minutes ago.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.752
He told me he was working
out the last of the bugs

20:52.785 --> 20:54.321
on the sniper math.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.455
(phone ringing)
Looks like he figured it out.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.756
I'll call you guys back.

21:00.293 --> 21:03.496
BUCKLEY:
Relax, people, relax!

21:03.530 --> 21:05.765
Only a few of you
are going to die today!

21:05.798 --> 21:07.934
Only a few of you!

21:09.536 --> 21:11.203
Yeah, the program's booting up.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.172
We're ready, Don.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.674
All right, let's light them up.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.947
Oh, stop your crying, people!

21:33.593 --> 21:34.961
All right, I got number one.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.463
Sierra Alpha, copy that?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.267
What's your problem?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.302
Huh? No problem, right?

21:43.336 --> 21:44.504
I didn't think so.

21:44.537 --> 21:45.505
Come on.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.308
Sierra Alpha has the shot
on perp #1.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.649
- Hey, Don, Don!
- Yeah, I see him.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.117
Your hour is up.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.619
We just need some more time.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.120
BUCKLEY:
Sorry to hear that.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.489
You just want more time to work

22:02.522 --> 22:05.358
whatever angle it is
you're trying to work!

22:05.392 --> 22:07.827
Sierra Charlie has the shot
on perp #2.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.162
That's not true; we just want
to give you what you want.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.998
You're prolonging the situation,

22:12.031 --> 22:14.033
trying to make me think

22:14.066 --> 22:15.167
I am in control,

22:15.201 --> 22:17.737
when actually, I am in control.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.841
Sierra Delta has the shot
on perp #3.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.376
Five minutes,
that's all I'm asking.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.477
Five minutes?

22:24.511 --> 22:25.778
Where is he going?

22:25.812 --> 22:27.880
What are you planning, Eppes?
Sounds to me

22:27.914 --> 22:30.216
like you're getting ready
to insert.

22:30.249 --> 22:30.983
Come on.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.187
We gotta do this, Don.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.188
We gotta go!

22:36.222 --> 22:36.989
All right, Charlie, where we at?

22:37.023 --> 22:39.191
Yeah, he's moving
and I can't get a lock.

22:39.225 --> 22:40.527
BUCKLEY:
What makes you think you can

22:40.560 --> 22:42.662
pull it off, Eppes?
You're blind.

22:42.695 --> 22:43.663
We gotta pull the trigger.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.931
COLBY:
We're not there yet.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.669
Unless you're not.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.647
You son of a bitch!

23:00.680 --> 23:02.815
I told you
I was gonna kill a cop.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.251
Well, guess what?!

23:05.284 --> 23:06.419
I'm doubling down!

23:06.453 --> 23:07.954
Grab Mama. Grab her.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.622
- Wait, wait, wait!
- He's gonna kill her.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.123
He knows what'll happen.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.025
Grab her! Get up!

23:13.059 --> 23:14.193
Get up!

23:14.226 --> 23:15.695
Get up!

23:16.629 --> 23:18.264
Come on, come on, come on.

23:18.297 --> 23:21.100
Charlie?!
(woman pleading)

23:21.133 --> 23:22.635
BUCKLEY:
Oh, and, uh...

23:22.669 --> 23:24.604
by the way, tell the bus company

23:24.637 --> 23:27.006
that you just got
them a discount!

23:27.039 --> 23:28.808
Wait! I put it up there.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.143
The FBI had nothing
to do with it.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.646
All right, I got him!
I got him!

23:33.680 --> 23:35.848
You couldn't help yourself,
could you?!

23:35.882 --> 23:37.850
Guess what?

23:37.884 --> 23:41.353
Sierra Bravo has the shot
on perp #4.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.089
- Take the shot.
- Take the shot.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.056
Take the shot!

23:58.471 --> 24:00.206
Can we get this

24:00.239 --> 24:01.107
off of me, please?!

24:03.309 --> 24:04.143
What happened?

24:04.176 --> 24:05.177
The bus is empty.

24:06.312 --> 24:07.179
What?

24:07.213 --> 24:08.280
No, no, no, no.

24:08.314 --> 24:09.882
W-wait, wait...

24:09.916 --> 24:10.750
(screaming)

24:10.783 --> 24:12.118
They forgot the ground wire.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.054
They're watching us.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.059
Wrong bus, Eppes.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.566
Did you really think
I'd let a cop

24:26.599 --> 24:28.267
sneak video out
right under my nose?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.469
I'm in control now.

24:30.503 --> 24:33.506
See for yourself.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.161
So, tell me what happened.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.297
After they took over the bus,

24:58.330 --> 24:59.832
they made me drive
into this alley.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.702
There was another bus there
waiting,

25:02.735 --> 25:04.771
and that's where they
transferred the passengers.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.639
They knew about
the panic button.

25:06.673 --> 25:09.008
They put that bomb belt on me,

25:09.041 --> 25:11.210
and then they
told me to push it,

25:11.243 --> 25:13.245
told me to send
a distress signal.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.581
They wanted us to follow you.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.683
You know, the only time
we didn't have eyes on them

25:16.716 --> 25:17.684
was those first few minutes.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.218
And they gave me
that headset

25:19.251 --> 25:21.287
to radio me instructions.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.022
Right, send us
on a wild-goose chase.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.224
You know, they could
be anywhere by now.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.193
I mean, that guy
totally played us.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.527
Kills a cop.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.329
Trying to tell us
he's in the driver's seat

25:30.362 --> 25:31.263
and can't be stopped.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.499
Don, you made the right call,

25:33.532 --> 25:34.500
I mean, you could've
never known.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.768
If I hadn't called for the shot,

25:35.802 --> 25:36.903
he wouldn't have pulled
the trigger.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.938
You can't be inside
the guy's head.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.340
That's my job.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.842
LIZ:
The second bus was stolen

25:42.875 --> 25:45.344
from the company's
repair yard last night.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.746
These guys planned everything.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.215
They didn't plan on
a cop coming on board.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.517
What do I tell his fiancГ©e?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.720
Tell her that he died,
uh, doing his job

25:53.753 --> 25:54.921
and, uh, beyond that...

25:57.624 --> 25:58.991
You want me to do it?

25:59.025 --> 26:01.260
No, I should.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.630
Line one. It's him.

26:11.437 --> 26:12.504
Agent David Sinclair.

26:12.538 --> 26:14.741
Sinclair, where's Eppes?

26:14.774 --> 26:16.408
He's taking a leak.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.409
What do you want?

26:17.443 --> 26:18.510
Well, now that you spent

26:18.544 --> 26:20.146
the past two hours
chasing your tail,

26:20.179 --> 26:21.013
getting a cop killed,

26:21.047 --> 26:22.448
it's time to get
down to business.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.183
You've got 90 minutes.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.286
You said we had till 7:00.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.121
Well, you've lost a hostage

26:29.155 --> 26:31.590
and a half an hour.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.293
He's moving the goalposts.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.395
What now?

26:36.428 --> 26:37.697
We gotta move them back.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.799
Clearly he's keeping us
off balance.

26:39.832 --> 26:42.501
All right, the diversion tactics
and the shifting deadlines

26:42.534 --> 26:44.170
and the threats.
It's classic.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.006
It's perfect for an
Inverse Game Theory Analysis.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.375
I think I missed
that day in school.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.843
- You play poker?
- Yeah.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.679
All right, so this
is a poker game.

26:52.712 --> 26:55.347
Two players, each dealt
a finite number of cards

26:55.381 --> 26:56.582
from a finite deck.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.417
Now, just like the FBI has

26:58.450 --> 27:00.186
a finite number of tools
at its disposal;

27:00.219 --> 27:03.622
the kidnappers have a finite
number of bargaining chips.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.792
And right now,
they have the advantage.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.260
You see, they've studied our
procedures and our tendencies.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.029
So, they know our hand.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.630
And they are going
to play accordingly.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.800
However, what they don't know

27:13.833 --> 27:18.070
is that the more they play, the
more they reveal their own game.

27:18.104 --> 27:22.909
Giving us a clearer picture of
their decision-making process.

27:25.511 --> 27:28.247
So, by analyzing
the kidnappers' moves,

27:28.280 --> 27:29.548
modeling their strategy,

27:29.581 --> 27:32.284
you know what, I may be
able to level this game.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.619
Yeah, except this isn't a game.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.088
Look, I've already lost
one hostage, okay?

27:36.122 --> 27:38.357
Next time the phone rings,
I'm doing the talking.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.428
Jack was a hero.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.563
You need to know that.

27:44.596 --> 27:47.399
Maybe someday
that'll make it easier,

27:47.433 --> 27:50.469
but right now...

27:50.502 --> 27:52.671
I can't go back
to that hotel room...

27:55.474 --> 27:56.843
see his things.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.544
I can send someone with you.

27:58.577 --> 28:01.714
Do you think I could just...

28:01.748 --> 28:02.882
stay here

28:02.915 --> 28:04.751
another hour or two

28:04.784 --> 28:08.254
at least until I get
my feet under me.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.390
Yeah, sure.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.325
Sure.

28:13.359 --> 28:16.128
Let me get you some more tea.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.437
Bag this and send it to the lab.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.740
Put a rush on the prints.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.510
- It isn't making sense.
- What isn't?

28:31.543 --> 28:32.644
The kidnappers' game play.

28:32.678 --> 28:33.913
They're like streaky
poker players,

28:33.946 --> 28:36.315
They go on a run and then
they suddenly go cold.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.184
They're making mistakes
an amateur would make.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.151
Well, maybe we're
overestimating them.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.219
No, we're missing
a variable.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.321
Alan, we're just
not getting anywhere.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.090
You don't have to tell me!
We've been having

28:44.123 --> 28:45.657
the same discussion
for the last 20 minutes.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.326
- You're not listening.
- Hey, guys.

28:47.359 --> 28:48.460
Stop it, all right?

28:48.494 --> 28:49.829
It's getting out of hand.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.197
Start acting like
adults, please.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.032
- What are you talking about?
- We're engaged

28:53.065 --> 28:54.266
in a very substantive
discourse here.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.235
Yeah, about whose idea
makes more sense.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.170
No, no, no, we've been
having a discussion

28:58.204 --> 29:00.039
about the merits
of each other's ideas.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.274
And Alan and I each decided
to concede, and of course,

29:02.308 --> 29:04.676
that became a new point
of contention.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.345
Hey, you know, we could
do a think tank on that.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.947
"Eppes-Fleinhardt Paradox."

29:07.980 --> 29:09.348
"Fleinhardt-Eppes."

29:09.381 --> 29:10.249
Wait a minute...

29:10.282 --> 29:12.151
Did you just trick me
into taking second position?

29:12.184 --> 29:14.520
It's like the time that
Bugs Bunny tricks Daffy Duck

29:14.553 --> 29:17.356
into declaring "duck season"
by declaring "rabbit season."

29:17.389 --> 29:18.190
And then Elmer Fudd

29:18.224 --> 29:21.360
shoots Daffy Duck
and his beak spins around...

29:21.393 --> 29:22.528
It was really very funny.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.032
Am I alone here?

29:26.065 --> 29:28.400
- It is a paradox.
- What is, Charles?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.902
The kidnappers.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.770
The mistakes they're making
aren't mistakes.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.540
Because they're making them
on purpose.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.042
I gotta go.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.277
Is it me, or did our think tank

29:38.310 --> 29:40.146
just have its
first breakthrough?

29:43.850 --> 29:45.717
I tracked down Jack Shuler's
partner in Miami.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.586
Never heard of

29:47.619 --> 29:49.188
a Caitlin Dawes,
let alone a fiancГ©e.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.224
Real name's
Caitlin Rienzi.

29:52.258 --> 29:53.359
Series of collars

29:53.392 --> 29:57.496
for fraud, one of them
an identity theft scheme,

29:57.529 --> 29:59.398
stealing houses
from retirees.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.567
The guy running the scam
was our ringleader, Buckley.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.902
She's in on it.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.904
Watching our every move,
stepping out to make calls

30:04.937 --> 30:07.506
to Buckley to keep him
in the loop.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.241
How'd you put it all together?

30:09.275 --> 30:10.509
Most grieving widows
want to get out of here

30:10.542 --> 30:11.510
as fast as they can.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.213
She wanted to stay.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.614
What, so she could see
if we'd pay the ransom?

30:15.647 --> 30:17.216
What do you want to do?

30:18.150 --> 30:20.419
Oh, I think we
should let her stay.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.587
Keep eyes on her.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.855
DAVID:
Hey.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.323
I found our crew's connection.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.295
Let me guess:
Walsh.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.031
No. Take a look at this.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.400
DAVID: Craypo, Hays, Kirov,
Buckley.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.267
Four years ago,

30:35.301 --> 30:37.369
they were all swept up
in a series of drug raids.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.906
Part of a RICO investigation
of the Cuban cartel.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.941
But they were all busted
in different cities.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.342
And interviewed
at different times.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.577
One of the guys
doing the interviews

30:45.611 --> 30:46.812
was a narcotics detective

30:46.845 --> 30:48.580
TAD'd to the feds.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.049
From Miami PD.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.417
- No way.
- Yeah.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.053
Buckley's the brains, but Shuler
put this crew together.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.122
Shuler's the one
who sent us the video.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.224
He was trying to stop
these guys.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.292
I know, but I'm thinking maybe
he had second thoughts.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.361
You know, Buckley starts
pointing a gun at a woman

31:02.394 --> 31:05.331
small child, maybe the cop
in him comes out.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.298
Yeah, guess again.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.334
I've been struggling
with my own model

31:08.367 --> 31:10.436
of the kidnappers' strategies
here.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.370
These inconsistencies

31:11.403 --> 31:13.605
in their otherwise
high level of play.

31:13.639 --> 31:14.673
And then
it occurred to me:

31:14.706 --> 31:16.075
that cheaters only cheat

31:16.108 --> 31:17.709
by making it seem like
they're not cheating.

31:17.743 --> 31:18.744
- What do you mean?
- Well, they

31:18.777 --> 31:19.979
showed us their hand.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.747
But only the cards
that they wanted us to see.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.349
Think about it:
the driver hitting

31:23.382 --> 31:25.751
the panic button, the obvious
route to the airport,

31:25.784 --> 31:27.153
these "mistakes"
that we thought

31:27.186 --> 31:28.554
we were
capitalizing on--

31:28.587 --> 31:29.588
it was all a cheat.

31:29.621 --> 31:30.689
It was staged.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.458
And they saved the best show
for last.

31:32.491 --> 31:33.692
The video.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.894
(gunshots)

31:35.928 --> 31:37.930
Slow that last part down.

31:37.964 --> 31:38.998
Frame by frame.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.106
COLBY: Look at that. The shots

31:47.139 --> 31:48.740
are out of sync.
The bullet hits are popping

31:48.774 --> 31:50.109
before the gun
even fires.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.778
You've got to be kidding me.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.180
Buckley's firing blanks.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.382
- And the bullet hits are fake.
- DON: Let's go back.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.283
Run it again.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.485
Punch in for me
right here.

31:59.518 --> 32:00.452
Down here.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.690
Yeah.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.559
COLBY:
There it is.

32:07.593 --> 32:08.527
The tech geek

32:08.560 --> 32:10.396
must have rigged up
these phony blood hits,

32:10.429 --> 32:12.631
and he's triggering them
remotely.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.033
DON:
Unbelievable.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.368
You got the streaming video,
murdering of a cop--

32:16.402 --> 32:18.971
these guys put on a show
and we bought it.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.848
So, the girl's in on it, too?

32:29.881 --> 32:30.849
Yeah, they wanted insurance.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.052
Confirmation we were
taking the bait.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.121
At least I don't have a dead cop
on my conscience.

32:35.154 --> 32:38.124
Yeah, but they're still holding
17 other hostages.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.591
They haven't killed anyone yet,

32:39.625 --> 32:42.028
but that could change if we
don't give them what they want.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.462
CHARLIE: No, I'm not so sure
about that.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.297
I mean, consider the game
they're playing here.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.033
Every single step
of the way,

32:47.066 --> 32:48.067
they've demonstrated
a marked inclination

32:48.100 --> 32:49.668
toward nonviolence.

32:49.701 --> 32:51.903
In fact, they've gone out
of their way not to kill anyone.

32:51.937 --> 32:53.272
You're right.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.907
Bomb belt-- that was a dud--
and Shuler's death was a fake.

32:55.941 --> 32:59.378
It's consistent with their rap
sheets: no history of violence.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.247
I think
that they'd like us to think

33:01.280 --> 33:02.948
that they're capable
of killing, but...

33:02.981 --> 33:04.050
You don't think they are.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.584
I think illusion's their weapon.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.818
Oh, wait.

33:06.852 --> 33:09.155
You're not seriously suggesting
that we call their bluff.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.489
We can't take that chance,
Charlie.

33:10.522 --> 33:11.357
We don't have to.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.025
The dynamic has shifted here.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.626
They've shown us their cards--

33:14.660 --> 33:15.927
including the ones

33:15.961 --> 33:17.096
they never wanted
us to see.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.265
So we have the edge right now.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.270
(phone ringing)

33:24.303 --> 33:26.272
You ready?

33:26.305 --> 33:28.207
Yeah.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.379
Uh, this is, uh, Len Walsh,

33:33.412 --> 33:36.115
the head of security,
HollywoodLine Tours.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.117
It's about time.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.618
- Where's Eppes?
- I told

33:39.651 --> 33:41.253
the FBI to take
a step back.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.221
Oh.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.790
So, um, you're the boss now?

33:44.823 --> 33:46.358
Okay, boss,

33:46.392 --> 33:48.394
there's been a little change
in plans.

33:48.427 --> 33:53.031
I want the money wired
to an account in the Caymans.

33:53.065 --> 33:56.135
I just e-mailed instructions
to your office.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.170
- As soon as I get confirmation
- Okay.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.405
that the money's been sent,

33:59.438 --> 34:02.374
I will send another message with
the location of the hostages.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.876
Let's just all play nice.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.345
Then we can go home

34:06.378 --> 34:09.448
and let the cop's family
bury a body.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.217
Listen, uh,

34:11.250 --> 34:13.952
how do I know you'll keep
your side of the bargain?

34:13.985 --> 34:15.421
The one thing you can count on

34:15.454 --> 34:17.956
is if I don't get the money
by 6:30,

34:17.989 --> 34:19.758
- this kid...
- No. Oh, please!

34:19.791 --> 34:21.427
is not going
to have a mother.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.561
Shut up!

34:22.594 --> 34:24.029
Shut up!

34:24.062 --> 34:25.597
(crying)

34:25.631 --> 34:27.599
(beep)

34:27.633 --> 34:29.435
All right.

34:29.468 --> 34:30.869
Now we wait.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.871
It's me. I just left the FBI.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.874
Making arrangements
to wire the money.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.810
Uh...

34:38.844 --> 34:39.678
Jack's here.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.880
We'll be at the safe house
in an hour.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.282
You look good for a dead guy.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.318
A share of 17 million
has a healing effect.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.388
What's wrong?

34:49.421 --> 34:51.723
Oh, there's the happy couple.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.859
The bus for Vegas
just left.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.230
You want to die twice
in one day?

34:58.264 --> 35:00.366
You're going to tell us
where that bus is.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.983
All right, bus is inside,
same deal as before:

35:18.016 --> 35:21.119
windows are painted,
so we got no visual.

35:29.995 --> 35:33.399
There's three bad guys with guns
on the outside on the perimeter.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.733
COLBY:
Looks like Buckley

35:34.766 --> 35:37.336
and the hostages are
still inside the bus.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.738
What's the call, Don?
What are we doing?

35:39.771 --> 35:42.107
All right. We've got five
minutes till the call.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.542
You guys take the rogue guards.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.710
Copy that.

35:44.743 --> 35:45.744
What about Buckley?

35:45.777 --> 35:46.912
I got him.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.715
Yo, give me 20 bucks.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.917
What, are you going
out for cigarettes?

35:51.950 --> 35:53.852
Just give me 20 bucks.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.903
(under breath):
What time is it now?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.674
Watch better be right.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.376
(air hissing)

36:19.044 --> 36:22.548
What the hell?

36:22.581 --> 36:23.415
Turn around.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.191
(dialing)

36:33.225 --> 36:35.160
(phone ringing)
6:30 P.M., Don.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.194
He's calling.

36:36.228 --> 36:37.629
All right, put it through here.

36:37.663 --> 36:38.697
Eppes.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.432
What happened to the bus guy?
Did he get fired?

36:40.466 --> 36:42.468
It's over.
You're surrounded.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.171
Kirov?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.306
Hays?

36:47.339 --> 36:48.840
Craypo, where are you?

36:48.874 --> 36:50.175
Come in.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.643
Come in. Come in.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.845
DON: I think it's time you and I
got down to business.

36:53.879 --> 36:54.680
You and me.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.248
Oh, really?
Get down to business?

36:56.282 --> 36:58.317
What the hell do you think
I've been trying to do?!

36:58.350 --> 36:59.885
You got no way out, pal.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.720
I got no way out?

37:01.753 --> 37:02.821
Really?

37:02.854 --> 37:04.323
Well, I think you're wrong.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.325
As a matter of fact,
I know you're wrong.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.926
All right, everybody get up!

37:07.959 --> 37:09.328
Up on your feet. Let's go.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.096
Back up! Get up!

37:11.129 --> 37:12.130
Let's move!

37:12.163 --> 37:13.599
Let's go!
Get out!

37:13.632 --> 37:15.033
I have eyes
in the back of my head.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.134
Let's go!
Everybody move!

37:16.167 --> 37:17.936
Nice work, Eppes.
You got us a visual.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.705
Stay there! Stay there!
Get down!

37:19.738 --> 37:21.573
Come here, come here, come here,
come here. Right, right here.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.241
Right here!
Let's go!

37:23.275 --> 37:24.576
Right in front of me!
Right here! Right here!

37:24.610 --> 37:26.412
No one takes a shot till I say.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.646
Hurry up!
Don't move!

37:27.679 --> 37:29.781
I'll shoot you! I'll shoot you!
Come on!

37:29.815 --> 37:31.450
Let's go!
Get down!

37:31.483 --> 37:33.184
Back your guys off, Eppes.

37:33.218 --> 37:35.754
Me and her are going to drive
out of here.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.323
No way.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.324
Not going to happen.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.591
Oh, it's going to happen.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.593
How many more people
you want to see die, Eppes?

37:41.627 --> 37:43.261
You're not killing anybody.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.096
Listen up,
all of you.

37:45.130 --> 37:48.199
I want you to slowly step away,

37:48.233 --> 37:50.336
one by one.
As soon

37:50.369 --> 37:52.037
as you're clear,
make your way to one of us,

37:52.070 --> 37:53.472
and you'll be safe.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.307
Do not walk away!
Are you nuts?

37:55.341 --> 37:56.375
- Come on.
- I will shoot

37:56.408 --> 37:57.709
the first person who tries.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.345
He's not going to shoot anybody.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.513
He killed a cop.
We saw him.

38:01.547 --> 38:04.015
They dragged him
off the bus.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.817
Who? This guy? Come here.
Darius,

38:05.851 --> 38:06.885
bring him in.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.021
- That's not...
- DON: It's all show, people.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.523
Those are blanks in his gun.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.291
I promise you. Walk away.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.460
He will not hurt you.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.027
Do not... do not walk.
Do not...

38:16.061 --> 38:17.463
DON: That's it. Come on.

38:17.496 --> 38:20.999
...walk away. Do not walk away!
Get back.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.267
Come on. There you go.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.869
Don't run! Don't run!

38:23.902 --> 38:24.936
No! No!

38:24.970 --> 38:26.304
Hey! Get back here.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.073
- Get back here. Get back here.
- No! No!

38:28.106 --> 38:28.840
Todd!

38:28.874 --> 38:30.041
No! No!

38:30.075 --> 38:30.742
I will kill her!

38:30.776 --> 38:32.811
- I will kill her!
- Todd! No!

38:32.844 --> 38:34.012
Get back here!

38:34.045 --> 38:35.814
(groans)

38:35.847 --> 38:36.682
Put that gun down.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.016
I'm warning you
put the gun down.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.351
Why would I put
the gun down?

38:39.385 --> 38:40.852
'Cause the longer
you stand there, the odds

38:40.886 --> 38:42.454
are one of these guys are
gonna blow your head off.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.055
Put the gun down!

38:44.089 --> 38:45.624
I'm not...

38:49.895 --> 38:51.897
All right. All right,
I'm putting it down.

38:51.930 --> 38:52.998
DON:
Nice and easy.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.099
I'm putting it down.

38:54.132 --> 38:56.568
Put it on the ground,
slowly.

38:58.136 --> 38:58.970
Turn around.
Put your hands...

38:59.004 --> 38:59.805
All right! All right!

38:59.838 --> 39:01.072
All right! All right!
All right!

39:01.106 --> 39:01.973
All right.
All right.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.008
All right.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.243
Yep, they're blanks.

39:05.276 --> 39:07.112
Charlie was right.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.059
(sighs)

39:22.160 --> 39:24.129
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.131
Liz took off.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.265
Yeah.

39:27.298 --> 39:28.767
Denver.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.868
You think she's going
to take the job?

39:29.901 --> 39:32.003
I don't know.
We'll know soon enough.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.142
I swear I thought
I got that guy killed.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.944
No.

39:38.977 --> 39:42.147
You kept your focus.
You're a good leader.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.450
Nobody died today.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.318
Got to have
a little faith.

39:47.352 --> 39:49.320
Yeah.

39:49.354 --> 39:50.756
I'm trying, brother.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.094
Well, looks like I'm late
for the party.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.863
Beer and champagne--

39:57.896 --> 39:59.097
it's a little overkill,
don't you think?

39:59.130 --> 40:00.699
Well, it's symbolic

40:00.732 --> 40:01.800
of Amita's brilliant
solution

40:01.833 --> 40:03.101
to the think tank
controversy.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.770
Which is?

40:04.803 --> 40:06.204
JPL's looking for a team
to consult

40:06.237 --> 40:07.606
on the next generation
planetary rover.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.441
Key to exploring
the fundamental questions:

40:09.475 --> 40:11.309
How'd the world come to be?

40:11.342 --> 40:13.078
Why are we here?
What's our destiny?

40:13.111 --> 40:14.079
Also critical

40:14.112 --> 40:16.548
to advancements in robotics,
search and rescue missions,

40:16.582 --> 40:19.150
oil and gas exploration,
surgery, I mean, you name it.

40:19.184 --> 40:22.220
Rabbit season/duck season.
Who says you can't have both?

40:22.253 --> 40:23.889
- You good with this?
- Uh, yes. You?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.758
- I like it. This your idea?
- That's right.

40:26.792 --> 40:30.128
Appropriate given that she's
the new team leader.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.964
- Since when?
- This afternoon.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.834
I enlisted Brecker and Galuski
in engineering a coup.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.037
So with me and Amita,
the voting majority has spoken.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.138
And wisely, I would say.

40:40.171 --> 40:41.740
Well, here's a toast.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.308
- To rabbit season.
- To duck season.

40:43.341 --> 40:44.242
I like rabbit season.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.844
- Duck season.
- You want a recount?

40:45.877 --> 40:47.412
- Thinking about it.
- Load up!

40:47.445 --> 40:49.014
(glasses clinking)

40:49.047 --> 40:53.251
* I'm ready to stop it *

40:53.284 --> 40:58.223
* I'm ready to forget *

40:58.256 --> 41:02.093
* I made my decision...
