WEBVTT

01:22.540 --> 01:27.461
Sold, ladies and gentlemen,
to Ms. Veronica Vreeland for $200,000.

01:28.796 --> 01:31.424
Bored? We've only been
here 10 minutes.

01:31.632 --> 01:34.385
Ten minutes for you,
10 hours for me.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.971
I know it's for a good cause, but...

01:39.473 --> 01:42.184
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
this magnificent timepiece

01:42.268 --> 01:43.853
from the reign of Louis XVI.

01:44.478 --> 01:46.689
Who will start the bidding at $400,000?

01:46.814 --> 01:50.735
You've gotta be kidding.
I wouldn't use that for a doorstop.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.130
Right on time, as usual.

02:17.678 --> 02:20.765
I have a bid of $500,000.
Do I hear $550,000?

02:24.685 --> 02:25.978
Good afternoon.

02:27.229 --> 02:29.231
Have they sold the Louis XVI yet?

02:29.815 --> 02:32.276
No, the bidding just started.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.361
How did you...

02:37.031 --> 02:38.449
I gotta see my optometrist.

02:41.827 --> 02:44.789
I have a bid of $585,000. Do I hear six?

02:45.247 --> 02:49.168
Come, come. This is a one-of-a-kind item
ladies and gentlemen. Who'll give six?

02:50.670 --> 02:51.837
Six hundred thousand.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.631
Six hundred thousand?

02:53.964 --> 02:56.884
I've heard that time is money,
but this is ridiculous.

02:57.259 --> 02:59.345
Like you said, it's for charity.

03:00.429 --> 03:04.642
I have $600,000 from Mr. Bruce Wayne.
Do I hear $650,000?

03:05.267 --> 03:08.979
Need I remind you, this timepiece
was once owned by Marie Antoinette.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.487
Relax, Dick. It's almost over.

03:16.862 --> 03:20.282
You're not gonna believe this,
but I thought I just saw the Clock King.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.204
Well, he was there.

03:25.454 --> 03:29.125
I have $650,000. Going, going, gone.

03:32.002 --> 03:33.587
Blimey!

03:47.560 --> 03:50.771
A trial run, and it went like clockwork.

03:54.483 --> 03:56.152
Hmm. Got one.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.458
<i>I have $650,000. Going, going, gone.</i>

04:12.918 --> 04:14.628
<i>Blimey!</i>

04:15.004 --> 04:16.338
Back up.

04:20.676 --> 04:22.428
<i>There. Freeze it.</i>

04:27.892 --> 04:29.977
That must be the hand
everyone talks about.

04:30.519 --> 04:32.354
The one that's quicker than the eye.

04:33.105 --> 04:36.108
So we don't have
another invisible man running loose.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.276
Then who could it be?

04:38.027 --> 04:40.488
I think it's Temple Fugate,
the Clock King.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.364
What makes you think that?

04:42.698 --> 04:44.241
Let's just call it a hunch.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.160
Better warn Mayor Hill, Jim.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.746
I doubt that time has healed
Fugate's wound.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.990
6:15, sir. Time for breakfast.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.410
I've also brought you your medicine
and the timer

05:28.494 --> 05:30.830
so you can take your pills on schedule.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.415
You think of everything,
don't you, Harold?

05:33.499 --> 05:35.543
It is my job, sir.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.295
How goes your research, if I may ask?

05:38.379 --> 05:39.463
Well enough.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.383
The iron ball has dropped
a mere tenth of a millimeter

05:42.466 --> 05:44.593
since the experiment began last week.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.388
An extreme temporal discontinuity.

05:47.471 --> 05:50.307
And the accelerated effect
is just as dramatic.

05:50.391 --> 05:53.978
Five minutes ago, that plant was a seed.

05:54.603 --> 05:56.480
Amazing, Dr. Wakati.

05:56.772 --> 05:59.733
Why, the possible applications
are mind-boggling.

05:59.817 --> 06:00.860
Indeed.

06:00.943 --> 06:04.446
We could get rid of radioactive waste
in minutes instead of eons

06:04.822 --> 06:08.200
put terminally ill people in stasis
until a cure is found.

06:08.826 --> 06:14.540
The question is, is mankind civilized
enough to make the proper use of it?

06:15.165 --> 06:16.500
You're right, Doctor.

06:16.584 --> 06:20.838
It's very important that this device
be kept in the right hands.

06:39.773 --> 06:42.693
I hope you're having
a pleasant evening, Mr. Mayor,

06:42.776 --> 06:47.197
because it's time for you and me
to renew our acquaintance.

07:05.382 --> 07:07.426
It's going to be a big ceremony, Jim.

07:09.970 --> 07:12.431
Fugate? No, I'm not worried.

07:12.514 --> 07:15.184
I've got a platoon of officers
around the building.

07:15.559 --> 07:18.354
<i>He can't get in the door
without bumping into a blue coat.</i>

07:19.146 --> 07:22.316
He's still on the phone.
You really think our guy will show up?

07:23.567 --> 07:25.736
Sure as night follows day.

08:07.277 --> 08:09.113
What am I thinking?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.875
Going to be a nasty fall, dearie.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.806
What the...

08:36.056 --> 08:37.182
Ah!

08:37.349 --> 08:38.726
I think that's our cue.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.187
You! How did you get past-

08:42.438 --> 08:43.731
Good evening, Mayor.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.150
Nice to see you again too.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.653
And whose life are you ruining now?

08:49.820 --> 08:51.071
A poor pensioner,

08:51.238 --> 08:53.198
a malnourished orphan perhaps?

08:57.119 --> 08:58.370
Naughty, naughty.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.040
What?

09:01.123 --> 09:02.750
Where did you...

09:08.839 --> 09:10.174
I don't think so.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.092
Even if you could climb the building,

09:12.301 --> 09:14.595
you won't be leaving this way,
Mr. Mayor.

09:14.803 --> 09:17.890
I've waited a long time for this.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.350
Please, Fugate, don't hurt me.

09:20.559 --> 09:24.271
If it's any comfort, my revenge
will encompass more than just you.

09:24.480 --> 09:29.943
I intend to pass a most timely sentence
on the entire judicial system.

09:30.235 --> 09:31.737
Get ready.

09:34.990 --> 09:36.283
My eyes!

10:02.726 --> 10:04.103
Robin. Grab the hypo.

10:48.021 --> 10:49.523
Get off me.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.191
What?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.739
You clumsy...

10:59.950 --> 11:01.493
You...

11:07.708 --> 11:09.001
Hey, you. Stop!

11:14.590 --> 11:16.592
Look. Over there. That's him.
Let's get him.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.218
- Come on.
- Stop.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.390
- Hold it right there.
- You're under arrest.

11:26.476 --> 11:27.936
- Don't move.
- Freeze.

11:41.825 --> 11:43.243
The Batmobile.

11:44.786 --> 11:45.913
Ah!

11:46.538 --> 11:47.915
- Hey!
- Where'd he go?

11:48.081 --> 11:49.416
- Look out.
- Hey, watch it.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.590
It was like a nightmare.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.384
First he was here, then there.

11:59.676 --> 12:01.929
My heavens.
If you hadn't set that trap...

12:02.596 --> 12:05.682
Well, at least we've got the pieces
from Fugate's broken thingamajig.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.309
Maybe we can find out how he made it.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.979
I don't think Fugate made that device.

12:12.522 --> 12:13.690
He's not a scientist.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.068
Well, we'll soon find out who did.

12:17.444 --> 12:19.988
All our patrol cars are equipped
with tracking devices.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.449
We should be able
to run Fugate down pretty quickly.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.371
Harold.

12:29.581 --> 12:30.666
Harold.

12:31.458 --> 12:32.918
What are you doing in my room?

12:33.001 --> 12:35.337
I called for you but got no answer.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.256
I thought something might be wrong.

12:37.589 --> 12:40.801
There is something wrong, old man.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.762
Why are you wearing that?

12:43.929 --> 12:47.182
I'm afraid I haven't been
altogether candid with you.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.935
What... What are you going to do?

12:50.769 --> 12:54.648
You'll find out, my good doctor,
all in good time.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.447
I want a dragnet over
a five-mile radius.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.703
He couldn't have gotten far.
With any luck, time is on our side.

13:15.919 --> 13:17.546
You think the police will find him?

13:18.630 --> 13:20.507
Doubtful, but I have an idea.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.426
With his knowledge of train schedules

13:22.509 --> 13:24.845
He would know when the next
commuter run would pass.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.514
It's no accident
that he ditched the car where he did.

13:28.056 --> 13:31.685
Only one train passed there in the last
six hours, heading for the mountains.

13:32.185 --> 13:34.104
I don't get it.
There's nothing out that way.

13:34.771 --> 13:37.566
Nothing except Cranston Estates.

13:44.072 --> 13:45.949
So you say this guy
lives out there?

13:46.033 --> 13:48.285
What's his name, this Professor Wataki?

13:48.618 --> 13:52.205
Wakati. He's the father
of quantum temporal theory,

13:52.289 --> 13:54.291
the structure of time.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.178
What's going on?

14:06.261 --> 14:08.096
Fugate's booby-trapped the car.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.390
We're trapped in time.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.196
What's going on?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.990
We've been put in a bubble of slow time.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.618
The outside world is moving
much faster than we are.

14:29.993 --> 14:31.161
Look.

14:31.661 --> 14:33.830
Hours are passing like minutes.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.501
Why didn't the car's sensors
pick up the booby trap?

14:37.959 --> 14:41.463
He probably set it just a nanosecond
or two out of phase with reality.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.340
But that's the least of our problems.

14:43.715 --> 14:46.843
E still equals MC squared, last I heard.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.929
Mass increases with speed.

14:49.262 --> 14:51.515
If a car hits us
while we're frozen like this,

14:51.598 --> 14:53.642
we might trigger an atomic explosion.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.108
There it is.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.819
Hey!

15:27.300 --> 15:30.762
Nearly as I can figure,
we've lost almost 48 hours.

15:31.304 --> 15:32.889
Then we'd better not
waste any more time.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.292
I think we've found the professor.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.382
How do we get him out?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.135
Same way we got ourselves out.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.102
Don't, Harold.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.562
Batman?

16:28.737 --> 16:30.906
Just make sure nobody fiddles
with the props.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.909
No problem.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.734
He was the one person
in the world I trusted.

17:07.817 --> 17:11.029
Is it any wonder I prefer
being a recluse?

17:11.905 --> 17:14.115
What else did he say, Dr. Wakati?

17:14.324 --> 17:15.825
He was babbling.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.495
Said something about the Mayor,

17:18.787 --> 17:21.706
about how he was finally
going to get his day in court.

17:22.123 --> 17:23.333
Day in court?

17:24.167 --> 17:25.377
The new courthouse.

17:25.835 --> 17:28.129
The Mayor is dedicating
it today at 10:00.

17:29.047 --> 17:31.633
That's two minutes from now.
We'd better call the cops and-

17:31.800 --> 17:33.969
You can't. I have no phones.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.306
Your phone won't work, Batman.
This area is a dead zone.

17:38.515 --> 17:42.852
I chose it so my experiments would
be free of electromagnetic interference.

17:43.478 --> 17:46.314
It'll take at least a half hour for us
to make it back on the bikes.

17:49.734 --> 17:52.404
You have 30 seconds to show us
how to use these.

18:08.878 --> 18:11.590
Wow, faster than a speeding bullet.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.554
<i>And so, my friends,
it is my privilege</i>

18:17.762 --> 18:21.766
<i>to officially bring Gotham City's
new courthouse to order.</i>

18:22.017 --> 18:26.938
By all means, Mr. Mayor,
usher the new building in with a bang.

18:36.197 --> 18:39.159
This could be dangerous.
Better stand back.

18:40.785 --> 18:44.914
Oh, to savor the moment
as long as possible.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.896
No. It can't be.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.448
Too late. It's triggered.

19:27.248 --> 19:28.875
Slow down.

20:08.998 --> 20:11.543
Looks like time just ran out.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.223
It's a shame that you've decided
to keep this device a secret.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.768
It would seem that the world
is not quite ready for it yet.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.812
Gee, that's too bad for Fugate.

20:31.354 --> 20:32.605
I'm sure he'll wish he had something

20:32.689 --> 20:34.733
<i>to make the days pass quicker
where he's going.</i>
