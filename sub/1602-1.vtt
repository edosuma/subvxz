<i>Previously on Bates Motel...</i>

00:01.859 --> 00:02.969
Norman!

00:03.231 --> 00:04.441
What happened last night?

00:04.453 --> 00:07.397
You said something about Ms. Watson
was going to give you a ride home.

00:07.422 --> 00:10.129
I don't remember. I just
remember running home.

00:10.166 --> 00:11.800
- Why?
- Ms. Watson is dead.

00:12.259 --> 00:13.869
I am looking for Norma Bates.

00:13.993 --> 00:15.528
- Who are you?
- I'm her brother.

00:19.033 --> 00:20.330
Get out!

00:20.367 --> 00:21.802
- He's your brother.
- He raped me.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.905
- You're unbelievable.
- He raped me, Dylan!

00:23.918 --> 00:25.140
I don't believe you!

00:26.076 --> 00:27.298
Get away from her!

00:28.109 --> 00:29.294
She's lying. Can't you see that?

00:29.319 --> 00:30.741
Norman, stop it!

00:30.753 --> 00:33.024
He can't help it! It's his dad!

00:33.031 --> 00:34.628
Caleb is his dad.

00:36.736 --> 00:38.345
Why are you doing this to me, huh?

00:39.156 --> 00:41.763
- Get in.
- You got the wrong person!

00:42.434 --> 00:44.206
Norman!

00:44.243 --> 00:46.526
You really shouldn't tell
anyone that you came here.

00:46.551 --> 00:47.998
You know what you have to do.

00:48.484 --> 00:49.981
I'm always with you.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.127
There's something wrong with me. I'm bad.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.023
You never meant to hurt
anybody in you life.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.697
- But I did.
- You have these blackouts

00:55.722 --> 00:57.019
and they confuse you.

00:57.056 --> 00:59.102
Do a polygraph on this kid. For me.

00:59.127 --> 01:01.011
- Is your name Norman Bates?
- Yes.

01:01.035 --> 01:02.495
Did you kill Blaire Watson?

01:02.520 --> 01:03.655
Norman...

01:03.800 --> 01:06.057
Norman. Norman.

01:06.793 --> 01:08.452
You need to know something very important.

01:08.515 --> 01:10.074
You didn't kill Blaire Watson.

01:10.124 --> 01:11.795
- I did.
- You did?

01:11.833 --> 01:13.879
We have to keep this a secret.

01:13.923 --> 01:15.420
Do you promise?

01:15.795 --> 01:17.379
I promise.

(man) Norman.

01:51.138 --> 01:53.395
Norman, it's time to get up.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.677
Morning, honey.

02:25.796 --> 02:28.179
You want toast? Here, I'll do this for you.

02:28.298 --> 02:29.347
Thanks.

02:29.466 --> 02:30.765
Get me the butter, will you?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.634
Sure.

02:37.140 --> 02:40.191
- So what's up with Norman?
- What do you mean?

02:40.310 --> 02:41.610
Oh, I just... I walked by his room,

02:41.695 --> 02:43.895
and his bed was made.

02:43.981 --> 02:47.866
Oh, we were talking in my
room, and he fell asleep.

02:47.985 --> 02:50.645
He was just so tired, poor thing.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.239
Don't you think that's weird?

02:54.324 --> 02:56.458
No, I don't think it's weird.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.959
It happens all the time.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.578
We just stay up late.

02:59.663 --> 03:01.329
- What difference does it make?
- Norman's 18.

03:01.465 --> 03:04.445
He shouldn't be sleeping
in the same bed as his mom.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.587
Come on. You're overreacting.

03:08.672 --> 03:10.422
It... He just fell asleep.

03:10.507 --> 03:13.058
It's not a big deal.

03:13.176 --> 03:15.010
- All right, fine.
- Okay.

03:15.145 --> 03:17.072
I hear what you're saying.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.198
- Good.
- Here's your toast.

03:24.271 --> 03:26.187
You headed up to the cabin again?

03:26.273 --> 03:28.940
Yeah, I got a lot to do.

03:29.026 --> 03:32.077
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take
this and eat it in the truck.

03:32.195 --> 03:33.361
I'll see you tonight.

03:33.447 --> 03:36.998
Okay. Okay.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.283
[phone rings]

03:38.368 --> 03:39.668
Be careful.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.753
(Dylan) Bye, Norma.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.006
Hello?

03:45.092 --> 03:48.209
(Ryan) Hi, I'm looking
for Norma Louise Bates.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.711
Who's calling?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.596
This is Ryan Pena from
the law firm of Hart,

03:51.715 --> 03:54.182
Stebbins, and Pena in Boise, Idaho.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.800
This is she.

03:55.886 --> 03:58.847
Miss Bates, we're the
executors of the estate

03:58.909 --> 04:03.141
of Francine Calhoun, your mother.

04:03.226 --> 04:06.528
She died on the 17th, and
my sincere condolences.

04:06.613 --> 04:11.282
We're working here on the
disposition of her estate.

04:18.241 --> 04:21.185
- I'm not interested.
- Pardon?

04:22.546 --> 04:25.714
I'm not interested, but
thank you for calling.

04:37.594 --> 04:40.311
First day of school senior year.

04:40.430 --> 04:41.730
(Norman) It sounds horrible.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.314
I know school always sounds horrible,

04:43.433 --> 04:45.183
but you'll get used to it.

04:45.268 --> 04:47.102
I don't particularly
want to get used to it.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.937
- I liked being home all summer.
- I know.

04:49.022 --> 04:52.857
I liked you being home too,
but you got to go to school.

04:52.943 --> 04:54.242
Besides, it's good for you,

04:54.327 --> 04:56.027
you know, meet new people, try new things?

04:56.113 --> 04:58.803
Oh, by the way, my mother died.

05:00.117 --> 05:01.666
Here's your lunch.

05:01.785 --> 05:04.169
Wait, what are you talking
about, your mother died?

05:04.287 --> 05:05.920
I got a call this morning.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.124
Yep, she's dead,

05:09.209 --> 05:11.710
and I'm only telling you
this because you might need

05:11.795 --> 05:14.629
to know for some legal document some day.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.632
Mother, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.350
Do you want me to stay home with you?

05:19.469 --> 05:20.885
No, I'm fine.

05:20.971 --> 05:22.771
Like, I haven't spoken to her in 20 years.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.664
It doesn't mean anything to me.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.981
[engine turns over]

05:48.165 --> 05:49.944
I don't want to go in.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.918
Oh, Norman.

06:00.010 --> 06:03.061
Sweetie, what happened
with you and Miss Watson

06:03.180 --> 06:04.562
is all in the past, okay?

06:04.681 --> 06:06.648
It had nothing to do with you.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.817
No. I can't.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.486
I'm not going.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.855
Norman, stop being dramatic.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.107
Come on, you're just used to being home,

06:16.193 --> 06:18.359
but you got to rip off
that bandage and just go.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.278
I'm not going.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.171
Get out of the car!

06:46.723 --> 06:49.057
Go to school. It's gonna be fine.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.309
I'll see you later.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.571
[dark music]

07:40.493 --> 07:43.455
(Miss Watson) I'll sit with you
while you have your lunch, sweetheart.

07:45.332 --> 07:49.083
I'm so glad you're back, Norman.

07:49.169 --> 07:53.955
This year, we're starting with
the modern poets with TS Elliot.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.257
You'll love him.

07:56.343 --> 08:00.295
"We have lingered in
the chambers of the sea

08:00.380 --> 08:06.801
"with sea girls wreathed
with seaweed red and brown

08:06.887 --> 08:13.024
till human voices wake us and we drown."

08:14.277 --> 08:16.144
Fuck!

08:35.164 --> 08:38.082
It's always beautiful to watch it burn.

08:38.168 --> 08:40.969
How many was that in total?

08:41.054 --> 08:43.304
27.

08:43.390 --> 08:47.892
27 fields burned down, 43 arrests.

08:48.011 --> 08:49.344
Your town's free of this trash now.

08:49.479 --> 08:51.429
You should be a happy man.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.473
Gunner?

09:35.558 --> 09:37.475
Dude.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.394
What are you doing up here?

09:39.479 --> 09:41.029
Remo told me where to find you

09:41.114 --> 09:44.115
before he blew town after
all that DEA crap went down.

09:44.234 --> 09:47.885
He said you rented this land,
told me you could use a hand.

09:49.406 --> 09:50.955
I don't need any help.

09:51.074 --> 09:54.793
He said you'd say that,
but I should come anyway.

09:55.912 --> 09:58.212
We'll see.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.586
Mother! Mother!

10:05.672 --> 10:08.423
- What happened?
- I was at school.

10:08.508 --> 10:11.509
I was eating lunch alone, and then...

10:11.594 --> 10:13.561
Tell me.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.346
And then I felt very strange,

10:15.432 --> 10:18.933
and I thought that Miss Watson
came and sat down next to me

10:19.069 --> 10:20.985
and started talking.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.946
I'm sorry, Mother.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.002
- Do you think you blacked out?
- I don't know.

10:38.121 --> 10:42.090
It didn't feel like it.
It just all felt very real.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.932
I'm sorry.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.801
I ran all the way here.

11:25.718 --> 11:26.717
Hi.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.886
- Hi.
- Hello.

11:29.005 --> 11:30.555
I'm looking for a room for a couple nights.

11:30.673 --> 11:32.140
Do you have anything available?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.445
Yes.

11:36.846 --> 11:38.513
Um, yes, yes, yes, yes.

11:38.598 --> 11:39.564
Of course.

11:39.682 --> 11:41.482
Come on in, please.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.488
Of course.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.404
Let me just get your info.

11:46.523 --> 11:47.772
Uh, what's your name?

11:47.857 --> 11:50.525
- Annika Johnson.
- Okay.

11:50.660 --> 11:54.579
And I'll need to see
an ID and a credit card.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.051
Okay.

12:17.187 --> 12:21.856
I'm gonna put you in room number four.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.357
Here are the keys.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.978
I'm just gonna take him up to the house.

12:27.063 --> 12:29.030
He came home early from school.

12:29.115 --> 12:32.366
He just wasn't feeling very well.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.369
Um, but I'll be back down
later if you need anything.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.288
I usually don't need anything.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.052
Okay, come on.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.833
What you got there?

13:05.919 --> 13:10.054
It's plans for a barn.

13:10.139 --> 13:12.757
For the motel?

13:12.842 --> 13:16.060
No, someplace else.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.064
You joining me for lunch?

13:20.149 --> 13:22.266
No, no, it's just a quick drop-by.

13:22.352 --> 13:27.655
I... I thought we'd continue
our conversation about,

13:27.774 --> 13:30.825
you know, the future of things around here,

13:30.944 --> 13:33.277
and I'm gonna have to take
a more active role, I think.

13:33.363 --> 13:38.833
Sheriff, look, I think I've had my fill

13:38.952 --> 13:44.922
of what it's like to work in
the drug business as a boss.

13:45.024 --> 13:49.343
I mean, I just...

13:49.462 --> 13:52.763
I want to have my own little farm, okay,

13:52.849 --> 13:55.967
and be legal about it

13:56.052 --> 14:00.388
and help people out who
have glaucoma and anxiety.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.139
Thanks.

14:02.225 --> 14:03.608
And...

14:03.693 --> 14:06.527
And just make enough to get by.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.813
Okay? That's...

14:08.898 --> 14:10.698
That's good enough for me,

14:10.817 --> 14:15.983
99 plants legally with a permit.

14:18.041 --> 14:19.323
- I protected you.
- I know.

14:19.409 --> 14:20.958
- I went out of my way for you.
- I know.

14:21.044 --> 14:26.213
No, I really appreciate that.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.715
I do.

14:33.589 --> 14:36.841
Okay, but you know if
we're not working together,

14:36.926 --> 14:38.476
then I can't protect you anymore.

14:38.561 --> 14:40.845
You know that, right?

14:40.930 --> 14:42.428
You'll be on your own.

14:45.234 --> 14:46.600
Yeah, but what I'm doing is legal,

14:46.686 --> 14:49.687
so that shouldn't be a problem, right?

14:49.822 --> 14:53.734
It shouldn't be, but doesn't mean it won't.

14:55.611 --> 14:57.706
All right, I'll see you around, Dylan.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.290
Hey.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.994
Is your mom here?

15:12.428 --> 15:15.846
No, no, she ran to the market.

15:15.932 --> 15:17.298
Can I help you with something?

15:17.383 --> 15:19.575
Ah, it's just my ceiling light's out.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.594
I can take a look at it for you.

15:23.439 --> 15:25.272
All right.

15:29.729 --> 15:32.196
- Excuse me, would you...
- Sure.

15:32.281 --> 15:34.871
Would you hold that
while I change the bulb?

15:37.904 --> 15:40.404
Um...

15:40.490 --> 15:42.990
you and your mom seem very close.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.307
Oh, yes, we are.

15:47.997 --> 15:49.747
But, you know, she does
have a lot on her plate,

15:49.832 --> 15:52.500
and I want to help her, so I...

15:52.585 --> 15:54.227
Your dad's gone?

15:56.089 --> 16:01.759
He died in an accident.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.845
I'm sorry.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.147
That's okay. He, uh...

16:06.265 --> 16:08.482
It wasn't a good situation.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.577
He wasn't a nice man.

16:12.989 --> 16:14.589
Well, maybe he knew my dad.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.423
Your mom's very lucky to have you.

16:20.947 --> 16:24.081
Yeah, well, she's had a lot of bad breaks,

16:24.167 --> 16:26.033
even moving here to start over,

16:26.119 --> 16:27.835
and let me tell you, a
lot of people around here

16:27.954 --> 16:29.370
have not been very nice to her.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.088
And now they're putting this new road in,

16:31.174 --> 16:32.957

would be that person again.

that she wasn't happy?

I don't know. She just wasn't healthy.

It was something that was never discussed.

32:28.437 --> 32:31.855
She... She took a lot of pills.

32:31.940 --> 32:34.741
I didn't even know where she got them,

35:28.617 --> 35:30.834
I was just picking up trash
that some raccoon got into,

35:30.919 --> 35:32.118
and I saw her through the window.

35:32.204 --> 35:33.670
I didn't mean anything.

35:33.755 --> 35:35.171
I know it was wrong of me,

35:35.257 --> 35:37.707
but it's nothing more
than what it looked like.

35:37.793 --> 35:39.593
I'm not crying because of that.

35:39.711 --> 35:43.713
I'm crying because my mother's dead.

35:43.799 --> 35:46.800
[crying]

35:52.891 --> 35:54.057
It's stupid.

35:54.142 --> 35:56.026
I didn't even really know her.

35:59.314 --> 36:03.900
I think that I am just grieving
because I never had a mother.

36:09.157 --> 36:10.424
And now you're growing up.

36:12.210 --> 36:16.796
Maybe growing up, but I'm
not going anywhere, okay?

36:16.915 --> 36:19.082
You know that, Mother.

36:19.217 --> 36:22.886
- I love you.
- I love you too.

36:30.178 --> 36:32.262
I'm gonna slide over a bit.

36:32.347 --> 36:33.454
Why?

36:35.363 --> 36:39.030
I just thought you were gonna
lay down just for a minute.

36:41.189 --> 36:44.295
Oh, well, I thought we
weren't doing that anymore.

36:47.446 --> 36:52.823
Just for tonight, because I'm so sad.

36:54.369 --> 36:56.870
Move over, you silly woman.

37:09.101 --> 37:11.134
[sighs]

37:28.287 --> 37:29.836
Hey, dude.

37:29.922 --> 37:32.122
Hey, did you know your uncle
knows all about construction?

37:32.207 --> 37:33.707
No, I didn't.

37:33.792 --> 37:38.178
He's built houses and a
couple barns in Costa Rica.

37:38.263 --> 37:40.464
How lucky is that?

37:40.549 --> 37:42.682
- You were leaving.
- Yeah, that's true.

37:42.768 --> 37:45.936
But the van... It wasn't the rad hose.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.854
It needs another part.

37:47.940 --> 37:51.274
They ordered it for me, so
it should be here tomorrow

37:51.393 --> 37:53.182
or the day after, latest.

37:55.230 --> 37:57.212
So you decided to drive back up here?

37:59.401 --> 38:01.735
(Dylan) That's bullshit.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.037
Whoa.

38:04.123 --> 38:05.455
Take a walk, Gunner.

38:05.574 --> 38:06.873
All right.

38:15.134 --> 38:17.050
How do you expect me to
have a relationship with you

38:17.136 --> 38:18.599
under the circumstances?

38:20.422 --> 38:22.413
Norma never has to know I'm here.

38:23.842 --> 38:26.426
Please.

38:26.512 --> 38:27.695
You're my son.

38:29.815 --> 38:31.749
Just let me be with you a little while.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.956
I won't ever ask you
for anything beyond that.

38:48.117 --> 38:51.868
(Emma) It looks like we can
take all the same classes.

38:51.954 --> 38:53.420
We have a quiz in English next week.

38:53.505 --> 38:54.921
We better get started.

38:55.007 --> 38:57.124
I'm excited. This is gonna be fun.

38:57.209 --> 38:58.788
It's very empowering.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.680
So, uh...

39:03.799 --> 39:05.966
So how are we gonna do this?

39:06.051 --> 39:07.767
Homeschooling? We're just gonna sit here...

39:07.853 --> 39:09.425
No, dating.

39:11.557 --> 39:14.736
Well, I guess we're just
gonna go places together

39:16.979 --> 39:18.945
like a normal date.

39:19.031 --> 39:23.650
Yeah. I've never been on a date.

39:23.735 --> 39:24.898
Never?

39:26.872 --> 39:29.372
What about Bradley?

39:29.491 --> 39:32.492
We never... We never dated.

39:32.578 --> 39:35.336
You know, that's, uh... yeah,
that was something different.

39:37.332 --> 39:40.300
Well, if you accomplished
all that without dating,

39:40.385 --> 39:41.942
and may she rest with God,

39:44.756 --> 39:46.520
then you should do just fine on a date.

39:49.082 --> 39:50.242
(Annika) Hello?

39:52.681 --> 39:54.386
Hi, may I help you?

39:56.401 --> 39:57.984
- Um...
- Oh, Emma, this is...

39:58.070 --> 40:00.770
This is Annika, room four.

40:00.856 --> 40:03.440
Nice to meet you. That's a beautiful dress.

40:03.525 --> 40:04.858
Thank you.

40:04.943 --> 40:06.243
I'm wondering, could you tell me

40:06.361 --> 40:08.078
where a restaurant called
Olive and Anchor is?

40:08.197 --> 40:09.996
I looked it up online, but I can't quite

40:10.082 --> 40:11.448
figure out how to get there.

40:11.533 --> 40:13.083
It's in the village. It's very nice.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.335
Yeah, but it's a little bit hidden.

40:15.420 --> 40:16.870
It's down one of the side streets.

40:16.955 --> 40:19.456
It's, uh...

40:19.541 --> 40:21.541
Well, actually I, uh...

40:21.627 --> 40:23.093
I have to go into town anyway

40:23.212 --> 40:26.680
to pick up that new
thermostat for room seven.

40:26.765 --> 40:29.549
So, um, I was gonna walk,

40:29.635 --> 40:32.686
but why don't I drive with
you and show you where it is,

40:32.771 --> 40:34.187
and then I can walk home.

40:34.273 --> 40:35.639
That's very nice of you, Norman.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.691
How can I say no to that?

40:37.776 --> 40:38.725
You can go now?

40:38.810 --> 40:41.228
Yeah. I'm the manager.

40:41.313 --> 40:45.865
Um, I'll be back in an hour or so.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.402
It was nice to meet you.

40:49.488 --> 40:51.454
Shall we?

41:02.834 --> 41:06.317
So you're working? Is
that where you're going?

41:08.423 --> 41:09.883
It's a kind of work.

41:12.477 --> 41:14.326
Why do you do this kind of work?

41:17.482 --> 41:19.498
You know how your mom takes care of you?

41:20.652 --> 41:22.686
I didn't have that luxury,

41:22.771 --> 41:25.939
so I'm doing this to get some money saved

41:26.074 --> 41:27.801
and make a living, that's all.

41:30.862 --> 41:32.579
I'm sorry.

41:32.664 --> 41:35.448
Don't be. I'm fine.

41:35.534 --> 41:39.071
It's just people... People's bodies.

41:40.872 --> 41:42.589
Once you start touching somebody's body,

41:42.674 --> 41:45.125
the rest of it just kind of melts away,

41:45.210 --> 41:49.809
and then you're just there, two bodies.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.739
Sometimes it even feels good.

41:56.188 --> 41:59.105
It's just sex. Sex is sex.

41:59.191 --> 42:01.057
We all need it.

42:04.229 --> 42:07.814
♪ Guess I feel for your greatest line ♪

42:07.899 --> 42:09.816
Do I turn up here?

42:09.901 --> 42:12.402
Not... Not here, no.

42:12.487 --> 42:14.321
Not yet.

42:14.456 --> 42:16.478
Turn down that road up ahead.
