01:22.457 --> 01:23.458
Johanna!

01:25.043 --> 01:29.214
Astra. I came as soon as I got your text.
What is it? What's happened?

01:29.297 --> 01:31.174
We have to go.
We have to get out of here now!

01:31.257 --> 01:33.218
We will. Tell me what's happened.

01:33.802 --> 01:37.430
He said it was an accident,
like when Mum died.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.185
Where is he?

01:56.741 --> 01:57.742
Oi. Logue.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.963
Hello, Johanna.

02:10.046 --> 02:12.006
What the fuck did you do?

02:12.090 --> 02:14.175
We was just havin' a bit of fun.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.219
"Bit of fun"?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.763
Summoning demons for fun?

02:18.847 --> 02:22.058
-Who's "we"? Where are the others?
-Must still be inside.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.561
-Inside the club?
-You don't wanna go in there.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.688
No. No, I bloody don't.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.566
But someone has to clean up your shit.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.070
I'll come with ya.

02:36.322 --> 02:40.743
Believe it or not, love,
it's safer in here, with your father.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.990
All right, miss. We're here.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.787
Sorry, long day.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.540
Mine's just getting started.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.876
I have a feeling mine is as well.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.516
Johanna Constantine.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.817
Look at you, all done up.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.486
What are you doing here, Hettie?

03:57.111 --> 03:58.571
Same as you, I expect.

03:59.822 --> 04:00.949
He's coming, isn't he?

04:03.117 --> 04:05.787
-Who?
-Yeah, well, you know who.

04:06.913 --> 04:07.872
Morpheus.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.250
The Oneiromancer.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.212
You know, the Sandman, he's back.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.089
"The Sandman"?

04:17.048 --> 04:18.841
The one who puts the kids to sleep?

04:19.342 --> 04:20.843
He's a fairy story, Hettie.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.513
He's no fairy story, missy.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.640
He's back, and he wants his sand.

04:26.683 --> 04:30.144
Good to know. I'm off to work.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.523
You'll see. I know.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.944
I'm 280 years old, and I know.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.072
Constantine.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.122
Have we met?

04:50.540 --> 04:52.041
We have business, you and I.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.378
Get in line, bruv.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.964
Can't keep God waiting.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.810
Ric the Vic.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.396
You're here! Thank God.

05:13.479 --> 05:16.774
Not as a favor though.
I'm getting paid, or I'm going to bed.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.610
Of course you are getting paid.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.821
This visit is strictly professional.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.365
Unless you, um, wanna get a drink after.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.951
Tell me what's going on.
Why have I been summoned?

05:27.535 --> 05:30.580
The usual reason. I have a soul in need.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.622
Who is she?

05:33.791 --> 05:35.209
Does it matter?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.962
If I double your fee?

05:40.840 --> 05:41.716
Triple it?

05:44.260 --> 05:45.595
Her family has means.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.933
If her family is in any way royal,
the answer is no.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.935
I'm done with that lot. I told the queen--

05:53.019 --> 05:54.937
The queen doesn't know she's here.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.148
Is it the princess?

05:57.231 --> 05:58.566
She showed up about an hour ago

05:58.649 --> 06:01.611
demanding I that marry them
before the palace find out, and the press.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.029
Why, who's she marrying?

06:03.112 --> 06:05.490
-Kevin Brody.
-Kevin Brody, the footballer?

06:06.115 --> 06:08.284
-He's rubbish.
-He's fit though.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.745
Just because
a Goldsmiths-educated princess

06:10.828 --> 06:12.372
wants to marry some naff winger,

06:12.455 --> 06:14.957
-does not mean she needs an exorcist.
-It's not just that.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.126
Just have a chat with her, you'll see.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.504
-No, it's too risky with the royals.
-But…

06:19.587 --> 06:21.923
If our chat goes wrong,
I've a dead princess on my hand,

06:22.006 --> 06:24.258
a demon on the loose,
and no one to pay my fee.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.844
-Fuck off!
-Jesus fuck.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.639
-What are you doing to me?
-Is that her?

06:30.515 --> 06:32.141
Can you not smell the sulfur?

06:37.605 --> 06:39.857
-Where is she?
-Thank you. She's in my office.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.943
You're gonna need the Rituale Romanum.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.153
I can't barge in spouting Latin at her.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.989
Has she been restrained,
or is that why she sounds like that?

06:47.073 --> 06:50.243
She sounds like that
'cause she's possessed by a fucking demon.

06:50.827 --> 06:55.206
Can we at least drug her first?
Get her drunk, tie her up a little bit?

06:55.289 --> 06:56.916
She's British royalty.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.042
They love that shit.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.169
Any other ideas?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.504
Yeah.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.549
Take your top off.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.348
Do you, Princess, take this--

07:12.432 --> 07:13.433
I do.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.439
Wait, babe, are you
absolutely sure you wanna do this?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.234
I said "I do" because I do, Kevin.

07:23.317 --> 07:27.780
No, I mean, you sure you don't want a big
royal-wedding-of-the-century type wedding?

07:28.364 --> 07:30.533
With the queen
and photographers and stuff?

07:31.659 --> 07:32.702
I just want you.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.165
Get on with it, please.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.208
-Do you, Kevin, take--

07:39.292 --> 07:40.960
Ow. Yeah, yeah, I do.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.670
Then repeat after me.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.225
Sorry, I've been fasting.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.646
Just in case there were photographers.
You know what I'm saying?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.400
-Doesn't matter.
-Keep going.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.405
Sorry, can we--

08:11.782 --> 08:13.993
Are you going to be sick? Kevin?

08:14.076 --> 08:16.245
Are you going to be sick
during our wedding?

08:19.582 --> 08:20.583
Kevin.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.064
Ric!

08:49.278 --> 08:51.531
You were right about the demon,
wrong about the host.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.157
-Fuckin' hell.
-Get her out.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.700
My God! Kevin…

08:54.784 --> 08:56.911
Come on, love. Come on.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.829
-Come with me.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.462
You… talk too much.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.340
-Tell me your name and I'll stop.
-Why would I do that?

09:09.423 --> 09:13.135
When there are
far more enjoyable ways to make you stop.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.804
His name is Agilieth.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.684
I'm flattered you remember me,

09:20.643 --> 09:23.896
Lord Morpheus, after all your time away.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.065
Lord Morpheus?

09:26.774 --> 09:27.692
He is.

09:27.775 --> 09:32.154
Though, I confess, I almost
didn't recognize you without your helm.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.282
I wonder where your helm could be.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.785
I presume it is in Hell,
with the demon to whom it was traded.

09:37.868 --> 09:42.331
Yes, but which demon?
Give me the princess and I'll tell you.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.626
Wait.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.045
Fine, fine!

09:48.129 --> 09:50.798
I'll tell you where your helm is,
just don't send me back.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.927
-Constantine. Stop!

09:55.011 --> 09:56.053
I command you!

09:57.847 --> 09:59.932
-Dream of the Endless commands you!
-Stop!

10:00.016 --> 10:01.934
Run along and fuck off back to Hell.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.902
You have no idea what you've done.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.032
I do though.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.285
I've just tripled my fee.

10:23.039 --> 10:27.710
Oi, Ric! Whom do I invoice for this,
Church of England or Buckingham Palace?

10:30.504 --> 10:33.424
-Is this a test? Are you testing me?
-No.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.178
You're usually so careful
not to mention it.

10:37.261 --> 10:40.181
I assumed it was
because my doctors told you not to.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.601
So why now? What's happened?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.355
You stole from him.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.024
Nothing's happened. I just--

10:50.107 --> 10:51.942
Do you think I don't know
when you're lying?

10:52.026 --> 10:54.945
Look, let's just say
that I have it on good authority

10:55.029 --> 11:00.159
that the ruby's owner is coming for it
and for the people who stole it from him.

11:00.951 --> 11:01.994
Then he's coming for you.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.539
-You're the one who stole it from him.
-And you're the one who stole it from me.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.460
You're the only one who knows where it is.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.462
He is coming, John.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.297
You've been saying that for years.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.840
Yes, but this time, it--

11:14.924 --> 11:15.800
Every time,

11:15.883 --> 11:20.012
every time you moved us to a new town
and changed our last name,

11:20.096 --> 11:23.349
wasn't because your boyfriend of the time
was beating the shit out of us,

11:23.432 --> 11:25.393
it was because the Sandman was coming--

11:25.476 --> 11:27.770
-I was trying to protect you.
-From whom?

11:28.979 --> 11:30.189
The Sandman?

11:31.899 --> 11:33.693
Or from my father?

11:35.486 --> 11:38.948
I told you, John,
your father died when you were a baby.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.617
Yes. You've been
saying that for years too,

11:41.701 --> 11:44.078
but you lie about everything,
lie for a living,

11:44.161 --> 11:47.039
you're Ethel Cripps, Ethel Dee,
you're Madame Daudet,

11:47.123 --> 11:51.001
and apparently,
I'm a man called John Burgess.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.257
Who told you that?

11:59.343 --> 12:04.014
The one… good thing about being in prison,

12:05.433 --> 12:08.561
you do have plenty of time to read,
and according to this,

12:09.395 --> 12:13.399
according to
"The History of Ritual Magic in England,"

12:14.024 --> 12:19.405
the ruby once belonged to a rival of
Aleister Crowley called Roderick Burgess.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.699
He also kept a mistress

12:23.159 --> 12:25.369
called Ethel Cripps.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.540
My father didn't die
when I was a baby, did he?

12:29.623 --> 12:31.459
My father was Roderick Burgess.

12:31.542 --> 12:35.755
Your father was a cunt
who wanted me to abort you.

12:38.007 --> 12:42.011
That may be the first honest thing
you've ever said to me.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.390
You want me to give you the ruby?

12:47.224 --> 12:48.809
Then you tell me everything.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.896
And this time, you tell me the truth.

12:56.192 --> 13:00.237
Yeah. The duke and duchess are
on their way to pick up the princess.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.238
Poor thing.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.450
She did seem possessed.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.367
She was.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.037
Love fucks you up.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.165
Your new man is not unfit.

13:14.752 --> 13:18.047
He's not my man. He's not even a man.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.008
What is he then?

13:23.969 --> 13:25.179
He's Endless.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.733
I said the Sandman,
and I meant the bleedin' Sandman.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.402
It's good to have you back, milord.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.905
Don't let her mess you about.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.952
My gran used to
tell me stories about you lot.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.830
I've known your family for centuries.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.499
Then you know there's not
one of us that can be trusted.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.587
What do you want with me?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.424
Something of mine
came into your possession.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.511
A leather pouch filled with sand.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.346
I need it back.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.430
Oh, that was yours?

14:10.349 --> 14:13.644
Bought it at an estate sale. Didn't even
manage to get the drawstrings open.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.020
Where is it?

14:15.729 --> 14:17.982
-No idea. Could be anywhere.
-We must find it.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.025
Must we? Why is that?

14:20.109 --> 14:22.278
Because without it,
my realm will cease to exist,

14:22.361 --> 14:24.738
and if dreams disappear,
then so will humanity.

14:25.948 --> 14:29.869
No offense, but…
I could do without dreams for a while.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.746
Haven't had
a decent night's sleep in ages.

14:32.830 --> 14:33.914
Nor will you.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.292
Until we find the sand.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.502
We must go, now.

14:39.753 --> 14:43.966
Does this approach generally work for you?
You just turn up and order people about?

14:44.049 --> 14:44.884
Yes.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.263
All right.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.016
-I'll help you find your sand.
-Good.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.310
-First thing tomorrow, and I work alone.
-No.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.438
Don't want you and your friend
following me all over London.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.273
-My friend?
-Is that not your raven?

15:04.653 --> 15:07.990
-My gran said Dream always had a raven.
-Not anymore.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.041
Who are you?

15:20.878 --> 15:21.837
Tell me your name.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.007
It's, uh, Matthew, sir.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.221
Matthew, I've made it clear to Lucienne

15:31.305 --> 15:33.807
that I do not require
a raven at this time.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.268
Yeah, she told me you'd say that.

15:36.352 --> 15:40.105
-If I need assistance, I will ask for it.
-Uh, you do, actually…

15:40.189 --> 15:41.815
She's getting away. Sir, she…

15:45.611 --> 15:48.155
See, this… this is why you need a raven.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.491
Go back to the Dreaming, Matthew.

15:55.245 --> 15:59.249
The only reason I stole the tools
was because I thought they'd help us.

15:59.333 --> 16:04.296
Then your father's men
came after us, so I hid the ruby,

16:05.464 --> 16:07.716
and traded the others…

16:11.303 --> 16:12.346
for this.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.438
The Amulet of Protection.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.192
It's what's kept me alive all these years.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.570
But it won't do the same for you.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.156
That's why I need the ruby, John.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.996
Even if I told you where it was,
it wouldn't do any good. I've altered it.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.250
It only works for me now.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.296
You don't believe me,
you can try to use it. See what happens.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.883
John, I have no intention of using it.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.302
I want us to give it back to him.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.306
-Maybe he'll forgive us.
-Maybe.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.395
But maybe we shouldn't give away a jewel

17:02.021 --> 17:03.647
that makes dreams come true,

17:03.731 --> 17:07.443
when we could use it to
dream of a world without the Sandman.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.197
We could start again.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.002
I'm back.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.382
Yes, in spite of my telling you to leave.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.677
I… I can't. I… The boss lady told me--

17:33.761 --> 17:35.596
Lucienne is not your master.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.140
She told me you'd say that too.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.477
Do you know who I am?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.271
Not entirely, but I…

17:44.354 --> 17:46.273
I don't even know who I am anymore.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.568
A couple hours ago,
I apparently died in my sleep,

17:49.651 --> 17:51.695
and now I… I'm a bird.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.990
I… I used to have thumbs.
Now, I have these things.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.036
Yes. And you must use them
to fly back to the Dreaming.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.499
-This world is not safe.
-You think I don't know that?

18:03.582 --> 18:07.211
I lived my whole life here.
That's why Lucienne sent me to help you.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.797
My last raven came here to help me.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.424
Yeah? Where is he now?

18:14.259 --> 18:15.636
Her name was Jessamy.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.891
She died. Trying to help me.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.394
I'm sorry.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.232
Look, let me at least
help you find this woman.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.191
If she's asleep,

18:29.274 --> 18:32.653
we've probably got five or six hours
before she's on the move again.

18:34.822 --> 18:38.117
If she is asleep,
then I know exactly where to find her.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.991
Johanna!

19:19.074 --> 19:21.952
Astra! Astra! Go back, now!

19:24.663 --> 19:26.915
-No!
-Astra!

19:26.999 --> 19:27.833
No!

19:34.173 --> 19:35.215
Don't let go!

19:37.092 --> 19:39.303
Astra! Astra!

19:39.386 --> 19:41.263
-No!

20:07.039 --> 20:08.457
For fuck's sake.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.794
How did you find me?

20:14.755 --> 20:16.048
You were dreaming.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.219
But it wasn't only a dream, was it?

20:20.302 --> 20:21.178
It's a memory.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.263
No wonder you do not sleep.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.265
Maybe I don't deserve to.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.309
Perhaps not.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.188
But I could make it go away.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.024
Only if I help you find your sand.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.737
Though, finding anything
in this place may require more magic

20:38.820 --> 20:40.280
than even you can muster.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.163
I'll look in the office.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.542
-Try not to clean up while I'm gone.
-I'm coming with you.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.796
You have a gift for disappearing.

20:56.964 --> 20:57.839
All right.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.970
But if the mess in here offends you,
wait till you see my office.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.854
Why do you humans
love objects so much?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.275
They do come in handy sometimes.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.487
You seem pretty attached to your sand.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.156
It's not just an object,
it's a part of me.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.118
If that's true,
how'd you happen to lose it?

21:26.910 --> 21:30.330
It was stolen by
another magic user called Burgess.

21:31.707 --> 21:32.916
Wait, not Roderick Burgess?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.503
The old Demon King himself, eh?

21:36.586 --> 21:38.380
Everyone used to say he was a fake.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.134
Said he had the Devil locked up
in his basement. How the fuck did you…

21:49.516 --> 21:50.434
Shit.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.650
Wasn't the Devil he had
locked up in his basement, was it?

22:02.654 --> 22:05.991
Were you down there? All this time?

22:15.667 --> 22:16.918
Is this you?

22:17.919 --> 22:20.756
Why? Do I look that different?

22:21.423 --> 22:23.258
Or younger?

22:25.427 --> 22:26.261
No.

22:27.637 --> 22:28.472
Happy.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.188
Shit.

22:38.648 --> 22:39.983
I know where your sand is.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.072
I've missed you, Mother.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.785
We were always very close, you and I.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.329
Especially when it was just the two of us.

22:52.412 --> 22:56.792
-It never was just the two of us, was it?
-Well, when you were between boyfriends.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.211
No. I meant the ruby.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.341
Well, you only ever
showed it to me on birthdays.

23:04.424 --> 23:07.260
You'd tell me to make a wish
and a pony would appear in the garden

23:07.344 --> 23:11.390
or there'd be snow
in… in July in my bedroom.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.809
I should never have done that.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.811
No, it was wonderful.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.689
I should never have stolen it from you.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.067
I should never have stolen it.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.863
You did what you had to do
to keep us both alive.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.615
I understand that now.

23:30.575 --> 23:33.328
And I'm just glad I can return the favor.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.667
If you bring me the ruby.

23:44.172 --> 23:46.007
I don't think that's a good idea.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.009
I told you I fixed it.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.971
The only reason those people
got hurt the last time was--

23:51.054 --> 23:54.307
People didn't get hurt, John. People died.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.767
You killed them.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.438
They were trying to take it from me.
I was defending myself.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.151
And now I can use it to defend you.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.361
But I don't need defending.

24:07.237 --> 24:10.323
I've got this.
It's you I'm trying to save.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.241
Is it?

24:13.034 --> 24:15.412
What can I do to make you believe me?

24:24.171 --> 24:25.589
What are you doing?

24:26.673 --> 24:28.800
What I should have done long ago.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.678
Protecting my son.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.308
If I give you this,
you won't need the ruby.

24:40.854 --> 24:44.191
Who is she? The woman in the picture.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.861
Her name's Rachel, Rachel Moodie.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.322
-Does she deal in magic as well?

24:50.405 --> 24:51.323
God, no.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.825
No, she's actually a decent person.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.661
Proper job, nice family.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.664
Fuckin' hated all the magic stuff.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.459
And yet you left the sand with her.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.669
No, I did not leave it with her.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.796
Sort of left it.

25:07.839 --> 25:08.757
And her.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.930
I was staying at her place.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.225
She interpreted that as
us living together, which we weren't, so,

25:19.226 --> 25:22.646
one night, I just went on a job
and… never went back.

25:22.729 --> 25:23.563
Why?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.068
Because it never ends well, does it?

25:29.319 --> 25:30.195
What?

25:32.572 --> 25:33.448
Love?

25:34.366 --> 25:36.660
No. I suppose it doesn't.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.621
I don't know if you've noticed,

25:39.704 --> 25:43.124
but people around me tend to get
ripped in half or cast down to Hell.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.418
Safer for her if I left.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.254
Did you tell her that?

25:48.129 --> 25:50.423
No. I suppose I'll have to now.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.802
This is her. Or it used to be.

25:53.885 --> 25:57.180
It's been six months.
Maybe she might've moved house.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.765
Please, have moved house.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.268
-Oh, bollocks.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.900
-Maybe we'll get lucky and she won't be--

26:09.609 --> 26:12.070
That's weird.
She didn't even ask who it is.

26:13.446 --> 26:16.825
Maybe she's expecting someone.
This could get awkward.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.160
More… awkward.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.665
-Wait here. No, you're not.
-I'm coming with you.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.793
Do you have any idea
how much she probably hates me?

26:26.876 --> 26:28.503
Do you have any ex-girlfriends?

26:31.214 --> 26:33.049
-I will not wait long.
-You won't have to.

26:34.092 --> 26:39.472
She's gonna slam the door in my face,
like I'm about to do with you… right now.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.963
Just get on with it.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.600
-Oh, my God.
-Hiya, Rach.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.564
-What are you doing here?
-I probably should have called… first.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.523
Sorry. Um…

27:36.112 --> 27:38.657
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:43.953 --> 27:47.624
I had all of these, um… things planned,
what I wanted to say.

27:47.707 --> 27:51.252
Go on then. Don't let me stop you.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.881
You look well.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.300
You look well.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.178
Uh, right, well, um…

28:01.346 --> 28:02.347
Sorry to bother you.

28:02.430 --> 28:05.642
I left some things behind
when we broke up, and I was wondering if--

28:05.725 --> 28:09.771
Did we… break up… exactly?

28:09.854 --> 28:11.981
Yeah. Uh, no, fair point.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.860
That was bad of me, and… wrong.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.988
I should have phoned or at least texted.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.741
Do you wanna come in?

28:23.243 --> 28:24.786
And apologize properly?

28:27.247 --> 28:29.457
I say this as someone
who was recently human.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.377
Human beings cannot be trusted.

28:32.919 --> 28:33.920
No.

28:34.003 --> 28:37.549
If I were Johanna Constantine,
I'd be up there cutting a deal with Rachel

28:37.632 --> 28:40.969
to keep the sand,
then cut the dream sand with real sand

28:41.052 --> 28:42.846
and sell it to the highest bidder.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.516
But then, I wasn't the best person
when I was a person.

28:47.058 --> 28:50.437
We can't all be Jessamy,
who was apparently perfect in every way.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.354
Matthew, I--

28:51.438 --> 28:54.691
No, I get that you don't think
you need a raven, but if you're out here,

28:54.774 --> 28:57.652
waiting for human beings
to help anyone but themselves,

28:57.736 --> 29:00.905
you're gonna be
sitting out here in the rain forever.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.784
Whatever they're doing up there,
they're not thinking about you.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.172
Shall we, um,

29:18.006 --> 29:19.799
take this apology into the bedroom?

29:22.594 --> 29:23.803
It's going well, isn't it?

29:23.887 --> 29:27.766
Yes, but you have a lot to apologize for.

29:35.899 --> 29:36.816
I know.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.736
-When you left that night--
-Rach.

29:39.819 --> 29:41.988
-When you left that night…
-Do we have to?

29:42.071 --> 29:43.490
…and you didn't come home,

29:44.908 --> 29:46.075
I was terrified.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.329
I'm sorry.

29:49.412 --> 29:50.705
I called everyone.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.124
Chas and Renee, Ric the Vic.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.002
I even called your exes.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.005
You did not.

30:01.090 --> 30:01.925
Which ones?

30:02.801 --> 30:03.802
Sarah.

30:06.387 --> 30:07.931
-Oliver.
-Oh, shit.

30:08.807 --> 30:09.808
And Kit Ryan.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.022
But they all told me to just get over you.

30:17.482 --> 30:22.737
Because you're a selfish, ruthless coward.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.578
Who ruins everything she touches.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.170
-Rach.
-Constantine.

30:40.046 --> 30:40.880
Wake up.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.224
What did you do to me?

30:52.517 --> 30:54.018
It was the sand.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.230
Where's Rachel?

31:03.945 --> 31:04.904
Rachel?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.200
-Rach?
-Jo?

31:10.451 --> 31:12.954
Jo? Is that you?

31:16.124 --> 31:18.376
That's such a wonderful dream.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.517
What's happened to her?

31:36.227 --> 31:38.187
It was not meant for humans.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.190
No, no! No, give it back.

31:41.774 --> 31:44.986
Please. It hurts.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.032
We can go.

31:49.866 --> 31:50.742
What?

31:52.619 --> 31:54.704
What? We can't go.
We can't leave her like this.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.665
We can't help her.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.919
The sand was the only thing
keeping her alive.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.340
You have to do something.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.843
If it wasn't for your sand,
she wouldn't be like this.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.428
I'm not the one who left her with it.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.681
What is wrong with you?

32:15.558 --> 32:19.646
You want your sand back so that you can
save all of humanity, well, here she is!

32:20.980 --> 32:23.399
But we're all just
Roderick Burgess to you.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.696
All you care about
is your sand. Your power.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.201
What is the point of you?

32:38.790 --> 32:42.335
Well, you got your sand back.
Why are you still here if you won't help?

32:58.351 --> 32:59.227
Wait outside.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.656
Rach…

33:13.950 --> 33:16.995
I'm sorry, Jo. I'm so sorry.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.457
It's my fault.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.377
All of it.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.464
Should never have left it with you.

33:32.593 --> 33:33.761
Should never have left.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.932
Well, you came back, though. Didn't you?

35:04.936 --> 35:07.313
No. No, put it back on.

35:07.980 --> 35:11.400
I've seen what happens to people who get
on the wrong side of you and that thing.

35:11.484 --> 35:15.196
I am trying to save you,
not hurt you. Here.

35:16.823 --> 35:20.868
This kept me alive for 116 years so far.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.871
I hope it keeps you alive forever.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.668
It's all a mother wants, really. Take it.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.352
One last thing.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.616
I'm sorry I was such a shit mum.

36:06.455 --> 36:08.499
No. Mother.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.627
Take it back.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.422
It's too late now, love.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.090
No.

36:18.759 --> 36:19.719
Guard!

36:20.761 --> 36:21.762
Mother.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.975
You don't need the ruby.

36:27.560 --> 36:31.105
No one can hurt you now.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.445
What did you do to her?

36:37.528 --> 36:39.447
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.993
I need you
to step away from her. Okay?

36:45.870 --> 36:48.998
You don't want to
point that gun at me, I promise you.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.750
Security requesting backup.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.715
Why don't you just let me go?

36:59.300 --> 37:00.426
For your own sake.

37:00.509 --> 37:03.763
I'm warning you, John, I will shoot.

37:03.846 --> 37:06.015
You'll only be hurting yourself.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.976
I'm sorry.

37:47.306 --> 37:49.350
-Freeze!
-Hold it right there!

37:49.433 --> 37:50.268
Don't move!

37:55.606 --> 37:57.024
Don't you fucking move!

38:27.596 --> 38:30.433
It's too cold
for you to be out here without a coat.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.314
Well, that's very kind of you.

38:36.397 --> 38:40.651
No, please. I insist. Yeah.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.030
What about you?

38:44.113 --> 38:45.990
Oh, I don't mind the cold.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.659
There, much better.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.708
May I return it to you
when I get to where I'm going?

38:55.791 --> 38:59.378
The only thing that matters to me
is that you get to where you're going.

39:01.797 --> 39:02.631
Thank you.

39:03.883 --> 39:04.759
Thank you.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.919
She died in peace. In her sleep.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.717
I'll let her dad know.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.183
You know, she was actually a good person.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.562
There are a few of them
out there, you know.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.565
They're not all like me
and Roderick Burgess.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.276
You are not Roderick Burgess.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.669
And what's your friend's name?

40:25.798 --> 40:30.010
-His name is Matthew, but he is not my--
-Look after him, Matthew.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.682
He needs it.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.108
Constantine!

40:46.360 --> 40:48.654
That nightmare won't trouble you anymore.

40:57.037 --> 40:59.957
That was… nice, what you did up there.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.084
Don't ever spy on me again.

41:02.751 --> 41:03.878
I wasn't spying.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.088
If I were spying on you,
you'd never know it.

41:07.631 --> 41:08.841
So what's our next move?

41:10.759 --> 41:12.720
I'm going in search of my helm.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.889
And you are going to the Dreaming.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.933
Or, hear me out,
you could take me with you,

41:18.017 --> 41:20.936
and we'll never have to
have this conversation ever again.

41:23.564 --> 41:24.899
That does sound tempting.

41:30.613 --> 41:35.743
In fact, where I am going,
I may have need of you.

41:35.826 --> 41:37.369
Yeah? Where are we going?

41:39.371 --> 41:40.372
Hell.

41:41.373 --> 41:46.212
Hell. As in Hell-Hell,
or were you being metaphorical?

41:46.295 --> 41:49.798
Because either way, we should probably
check in with Lucienne first, right?

41:49.882 --> 41:51.800
See how she's feeling about it.

41:51.884 --> 41:54.637
I'm gonna go out on a limb,
which is something birds actually do,

41:54.720 --> 41:58.265
and say she will
not be in favor of Hell-going.

41:58.349 --> 42:03.270
But I don't get a sense you're listening,
so, fuck it, let's go to Hell!
