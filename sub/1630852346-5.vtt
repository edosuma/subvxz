Not a shred of evidence.
I'd be impressed... if I wasn't me.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.243
The party guests all seem to say
about the same thing:

00:35.326 --> 00:39.581
a crazy buff gentleman stole the headdress
and gave a speech about the end times.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.500
Then Ms. Nowhere and the kids showed up
and a fight broke out.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.627
So maybe they're innocent after all?

00:44.711 --> 00:47.172
Well, some of the witnesses
claimed to have seen

00:47.255 --> 00:50.008
Ms. Nowhere dancing
with the crazy guy earlier, so...

00:50.091 --> 00:50.925
[Julius] Guilty?

00:51.009 --> 00:54.637
-[Gary] But Tony did save Palindrome.
-[Julius] Innocent again!

00:54.721 --> 00:58.683
Innocent, guilty...
That's for a jury to decide.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.644
Our job is to bring them in. To justice.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.980
[Palindrome] And Palindrome
always gets his man.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.358
Or lady. In this case... maybe both.

[newsreader] Foreign dignitaries
were attacked today

01:17.202 --> 01:20.455
in what authorities are calling
a heist gone wrong.

01:20.538 --> 01:24.250
Police are searching for
a middle-aged woman and four teenagers.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.627
Are you kidding me?

01:25.710 --> 01:28.630
I know! They must think
we're working with Moray!

01:28.713 --> 01:31.424
No! They had the nerve
to call me middle-aged.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.302
-[Ms. Nowhere] I'm in my prime!
-[beeping]

01:34.385 --> 01:36.596
[sirens sound]

01:36.679 --> 01:39.891
Great. Now we're double fugitives
for two crimes we didn't commit.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.726
-We got bogies on our six!
-Huh?

01:43.228 --> 01:45.688
-[Frostee] Uh, and on our nine.
-[Tony] And our three!

01:45.772 --> 01:47.440
[Tony] They're all over the clock!

01:58.993 --> 01:59.911
[Layla] Guys, stop!

01:59.994 --> 02:02.163
We're cloaked. Just pull over.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.708
-[sirens wail]
-[Frostee] That was close.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.460

02:20.807 --> 02:23.601
Oh, no! They must have hit the mainframe!

02:23.685 --> 02:26.229
Actually, we just ran out of gas.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.357
How the heck did that happen?
We were just at a gas station.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.358
I had slushies.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.068
-I was the lookout.
-I got snacks.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.278
I don't even drive!

02:33.361 --> 02:37.740
How about from now on,
we don't leave the gas station without,

02:37.824 --> 02:39.409
you know, gas!

02:40.368 --> 02:43.913
Okay, I'll go get gas. You guys wait here
and figure out what our next step is.

02:43.997 --> 02:44.831
Simple.

02:44.914 --> 02:49.794
We arrange a parlay with Palindrome.
I tell him everything I know about Moray.

02:49.878 --> 02:55.592
We team up - if I'm feeling generous -
and then we take that sucker down!

02:55.675 --> 02:58.261
Then Roscoe and I
can go get more pork pies.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.178
[barks]

02:59.262 --> 03:01.389
What if Palindrome doesn't believe us?

03:01.472 --> 03:03.933
Yeah, we'd basically just be
turning ourselves in.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.268
You got any better ideas?

03:05.643 --> 03:07.520
We could find Uncle Tuco.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.399
He lives here. He could help us lay low,
at least until the heat dies down.

03:11.482 --> 03:15.028
Are you kidding? For all we know,
Tuco is working with Moray.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.781
We've been over this.
Tuco is family. He'd never.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.076
So you want to run to
the guy who wants to lock us up,

03:22.160 --> 03:24.412
and you two want to run to
the guy who set us up?

03:24.495 --> 03:27.832
-Tuco didn't set us up!
-What's your plan, then?

03:28.291 --> 03:29.876
My plan is to just run.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.545
Typical Layla. Save your own butt.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.047
That's not what I meant!

03:34.130 --> 03:36.007
[woman on megaphone] Don't move!

03:36.090 --> 03:39.886
We have you surrounded!
Seriously, just hang on down there.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.096
As soon as I figure out
how to land this thing,

03:42.180 --> 03:45.183
we're gonna take you in
and collect our reward money.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.560
It's those two idiots, Nacho and Rollie.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.146

and I can hear you.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.525

[Nacho] You do! Fifty dollars!

03:57.695 --> 04:00.198
[Rollie] Wait, just 50?
I thought it was more.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.701
[Nacho] Well, I don't remember.
I'm not good with numbers, okay?

04:06.120 --> 04:10.124
Great, they're leading the cops to us.

We talked about this. We need
to find a way to contact Palindrome.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.025
Yeah, you're right,
we did talk about this,

07:23.109 --> 07:26.654
and we agreed that contacting the guy
who's trying to hunt us down is insane.

07:26.737 --> 07:30.283
So is talking with Tuco!
We need to run. Think about this.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.869
[Tony] No, I have, Layla. Tuco is family.

07:32.952 --> 07:36.831
Just because you wouldn't turn on family,
doesn't mean they wouldn't turn on you.

07:36.914 --> 07:41.669
Guys, if you keep arguing over the comms,
the police will be able to track us.

-If they would just listen to me...
-[Layla] You're not listening to us!

07:45.214 --> 07:47.091
I'm listening. I don't like what I hear.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.928
-I don't like what any of you are saying.
-Police scanners...

07:51.012 --> 07:53.139
If you have it figured out,
do what you want.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.056
Maybe I will.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.349
I definitely will.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.267

Tuco's about to wrestle,
so he's got to be back here.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.993
We need to split up, find him,
and find out what he knows.

08:14.076 --> 08:17.538
Or, hopefully, what he doesn't know.
And remember, we're still wanted.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.583
Lay low, find Tuco. We got this.

[emotional music plays]

08:38.601 --> 08:42.063
So why the surprise?
You should have told me you were coming.

I can get a discount on tickets
and 5% off elotes.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.318
Uncle...

08:48.194 --> 08:49.403
I'm on the run.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.573
Me, Frostee, Echo, Tony...
We've been framed!

08:52.657 --> 08:54.617
Whoa, bro! Framed?

08:55.576 --> 08:57.245
Was it, uh... lizard people?

08:57.328 --> 08:59.747
No! You were there at the party in LA.

09:00.164 --> 09:03.793
The building was attacked.
What did you think happened to us?

09:03.876 --> 09:04.752
I don't know.

09:04.835 --> 09:07.630
I went to the bathroom,
there was an earthquake,

09:07.713 --> 09:11.050
then that big guy Gary
had some guys drive me away.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.053
[stammers] Hey,
I left you a note at the garage.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.264
We never made it back to the garage.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.225
Whoa. Heavy...

09:19.809 --> 09:22.270
Look, I hate to ask, but...

09:22.853 --> 09:25.648
The person who framed us
is a man named Moray.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.401
You don't... You don't know him, do you?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.153
No... But I wish I did!

09:31.237 --> 09:33.573
-[rock music plays]
-I'd get him in a full nelson...

09:33.656 --> 09:36.576
and then I'd reverse
to a headlock... [roars]

09:36.659 --> 09:37.660
until he confessed.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.579
Oh, thank goodness.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.872
-Hit him with a clothesline!
-Whoa!

09:41.956 --> 09:44.584
Drop a knee on his neck, and tell him,

09:44.667 --> 09:48.379
"That's what you get
for messing with my familia."

09:48.462 --> 09:49.380
Okay.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.341
Maybe we'll use that later,
but right now, can you help us?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.342
We need to lay low.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.637
Of course. After the match,
we'll find your friends,

09:57.179 --> 09:59.390

Welcome to Nowhere.

Is Gary's voice coming out of that elf?

10:45.061 --> 10:49.440
Yup! The Damsels of Dashpire
was created by the agency.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.360
It's a backdoor database
for agents in the field.

10:52.443 --> 10:56.614
The Damsels of Dashpire was one of
the agency's more lucrative gambles.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.247
That's it?

11:05.331 --> 11:08.918
I thought we were trying to contact
Palindrome and get him the info on Moray.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.171
That's exactly what we've done.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.342
[nervously] So... Um...

11:16.425 --> 11:20.012
So we're riding solo now,
just the two of us. [chuckles nervously]

11:20.096 --> 11:23.808
No team anymore, that's...
That's cool. I can hang.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.437
-Are you--
-We can't do this!

11:28.521 --> 11:30.106
The team needs us.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.900
I'm the only one who knows
what all the buttons are for!

11:32.983 --> 11:35.069
And Layla, we'd be lost without you.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.446
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.489
I'm serious.

It's like, before you came along,

11:40.408 --> 11:43.869
our team was pizza, and we thought
we were fine until we met ranch dip,

11:43.953 --> 11:45.454
and it was like, what?!

11:45.538 --> 11:48.874
This makes it so much better!
We've been missing out.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.669
[emotional music plays]

11:51.752 --> 11:55.005
Uh, what are those for?
[quietly] Are we blowing stuff up?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.591
No, I'm just picking up gas
for the hauler.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.094
And these chips.
I haven't tried this flavor yet.

12:00.177 --> 12:03.305
We're going back? Why didn't you
say that before my freak-out?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.558
Because I was mad! I still am.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.852
When I said we should run,
I meant together.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.021
But Toretto was so sure
that I was gonna abandon y'all.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.399
Obviously he still doesn't
think of me as family.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.527
That's not true.
Didn't you hear me just now?

12:16.610 --> 12:18.529
The ranch was you.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.740
I know you feel that way. I just...

12:22.408 --> 12:24.368
wish everyone else did, too.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.369
[typing]

12:26.162 --> 12:30.374
Nowhere's getting sloppy,
logging into the database willy-nilly.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.751
Or, she did it on purpose.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.171
[Palindrome] Look at her username.

12:35.671 --> 12:40.551
Ah, Tacocat! Of course! It's a, uh...

12:40.634 --> 12:41.927
A palindrome!

12:42.011 --> 12:43.512
[in unison] A palindrome!

12:43.929 --> 12:45.473
This is a message.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.974
[suspenseful music plays]

12:47.057 --> 12:49.059
[Palindrome] Look into this "Moray."

12:49.643 --> 12:50.561
What about you?

12:50.644 --> 12:53.939
Me? I'm going shopping.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.735
[rhythmic music plays]

13:02.198 --> 13:05.034
Looks like Palindrome got my message.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.536
Gary and Julius are looking into it.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.871
How do you know all that?

13:08.954 --> 13:11.832
He gave me a signal
just now in old spy code.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.292
Didn't they teach you?

13:17.755 --> 13:22.134
Ugh! Well...
Palindrome wants to meet, but not here.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.220
You got that from a hat?

13:26.263 --> 13:28.557
So, do we wait for Palindrome here?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.768
No. We look for another signal.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.645
Only an FBI agent

13:32.728 --> 13:37.441
would make the first rendezvous point
the actual rendezvous point. [laughs]

13:40.611 --> 13:41.445
Hm.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.824
So, newspaper on a bush means alley?

13:45.908 --> 13:50.246
No, the newspaper wasn't the signal.
It was all about the double fold.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.247
Pay attention!

13:54.750 --> 13:58.003
Intersection of Madero and 113.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.838

Oh... [laughs]

Wordplay? Oh Palindrome,
you clever Tacocat.

14:13.477 --> 14:18.357
-Are you sure that was the last clue?
-Yes. The churro was very clear.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.707
Nowhere.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.375
Palindrome.

14:36.876 --> 14:40.337
I see you got my message,
so you know we've been framed.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.008
-It doesn't matter what I know.
-Well, maybe it should!

14:44.091 --> 14:48.804
Moray's out there planning something and
he has our agency chasing its own tail.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.931
My job is to bring you in!

14:51.015 --> 14:52.391
Are you a robot?

14:52.474 --> 14:55.144
[robotically] Do you only do
what others program you to do?

14:55.561 --> 14:57.938
Or is there a brain in there, somewhere,

14:58.022 --> 15:02.026
behind those layers and layers
of rippling... glistening...

15:02.693 --> 15:03.527

15:04.570 --> 15:06.405
Seriously, do you use baby oil?

15:07.531 --> 15:09.366
Don't compli-sult me!

15:09.825 --> 15:12.995
Look, you can waste your time
chasing after me,

15:13.078 --> 15:14.872
or you can help us out.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.624
It's your call.

[dramatic music plays]

15:18.709 --> 15:20.294
Uh, Cisco?

15:20.377 --> 15:23.756
I've looked everywhere. I walked
around this place, like, three times.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.757
No sign of Tuco.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.843
Oh. I waited by the bathroom
for five minutes and found him.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.595
-What?
-He didn't frame us.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.597
He doesn't even know who Moray is.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.266
He's just an honest dude
with a very small bladder.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.736
[Cisco] Bro hug!

15:45.819 --> 15:49.615
That's common...
[scoffs] Eh, nothing to read into.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.326
[laughing] Moray's probably
just a big fan,

15:52.409 --> 15:55.704
and Tuco's patting him on the back
because he's so friendly.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.624
[Cisco] Oh, man! Yeah,
they definitely know each other!

15:59.291 --> 16:01.710
I can't believe it. Tuco lied to me!

16:02.044 --> 16:04.171
Family doesn't lie to family.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.089
Are you okay?

16:05.589 --> 16:09.176
No! How could he do that to me?

16:09.259 --> 16:13.263
Yo, he looked me in the eye,
[sobbing] and I believed him!

and get to the bottom of this.

I ate it anyway.

you got to throw real punches.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.398
Hopefully Tuco's match
will last that long.

17:46.482 --> 17:50.069
[Moray] Of course it will. That oaf
loves the adulation and the fame.

when the revolution comes.

you bro-hugged him...
