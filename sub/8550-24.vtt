[theme music]

00:04.605 --> 00:07.941
Hey, Waldo.
How do I look?

00:08.008 --> 00:10.544
With your eyes.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.383
Man, this is gonna be
some concert.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.685
Nine rap groups
in one night.

00:17.751 --> 00:21.355
Yeah. I just hope they don't all
sing at the same time.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.127
No, Waldo.
They'll probably take turns.

00:26.194 --> 00:29.163
Oh. Cool.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.764
There is just one problem.

00:30.831 --> 00:34.034
Our seats are right next to
the speakers and it'll be hard

00:34.102 --> 00:36.270
for the honeys to hear
our clever pick-up lines.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.906
I got that covered. I've
got one clever pick-up line

00:38.972 --> 00:43.544
and the girls
are gonna hear it.

00:43.611 --> 00:48.349
Hey, babe.
Looking good.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.153
Are those real?

00:55.189 --> 00:56.657
A bull horn.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.992
Waldo, that is so stupid,
it's brilliant.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.095
Thank you.

01:02.796 --> 01:06.267
I need this.
Let's go.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.676
Thanks.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.614
[music continues]

01:26.754 --> 01:30.558
* It's a rare condition
this day and age *

01:30.624 --> 01:34.295
* To read any good news
on the newspaper page *

01:34.362 --> 01:37.531
* Love and tradition
of the grand design *

01:37.598 --> 01:41.869
* Some people say
it's even harder to find *

01:41.935 --> 01:45.239
* Well then there must be
some magic clue *

01:45.306 --> 01:49.343
* Inside these tearful walls *

01:49.410 --> 01:52.913
* Cause all I see
is a tower of dreams *

01:52.980 --> 01:58.118
* Real love burstin'
out of every seam *

01:58.186 --> 02:00.854
* As days go by *

02:00.921 --> 02:05.092
* We're gonna fill our house
with happiness *

02:05.159 --> 02:08.429
* The moon may cry *

02:08.496 --> 02:11.999
* We're gonna smother
the blues with tenderness *

02:12.065 --> 02:15.102
* When days go by *

02:15.169 --> 02:16.904
* There's room for you *

02:16.970 --> 02:18.572
* Room for me *

02:18.639 --> 02:22.876
* For gentle hearts
an opportunity *

02:22.943 --> 02:25.746
* As days go by *

02:25.813 --> 02:30.451
* It's the bigger love
of the family *

02:41.862 --> 02:43.197
I don't believe it.

02:43.264 --> 02:46.033
Pierce is made captain. He's
three years younger than me.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.268
Well,
it's not fair, sir.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.036
You're every bit
as good as Pierce.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.740
I know. I suck up to all
the same people. Don't I?

02:52.806 --> 02:58.346
Hey, nobody kisses butt
like you, sir.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.613
Thank you, Winslow.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.216
Hey, Pierce
probably cheated.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.518
By working hard
and being conscientious.

03:04.585 --> 03:08.456
Yeah. That lowlife.
He donates blood.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.158
He's a big brother.
He does volunteer work

03:11.225 --> 03:12.393
at the old folks' home.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.727
- Uh.
- Ha ha ha.

03:13.794 --> 03:17.064
- Some guys have no shame.
- Yeah.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.832
Bonjour.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.574
Hello, Steve.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.041
What's with
the get up, nerd?

03:28.108 --> 03:33.981
Oh. I was working
in my laboratory, flatfoot.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.749
I was attempting
to fix Urkelbot.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.452
Urkel-butt?

03:38.519 --> 03:40.821
Uh, no, sir.
That's Urkelbot.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.258
Some crazy mixed-up robot that
Steve built a few months ago.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.861
It went haywire and fell in love
with my daughter.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.998
Carl, I know why Urkelbot
malfunctioned.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.602
Several microchips and his
personality circuit went bad.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.970
I was fixing it
when it hit me.

03:57.037 --> 04:01.074
- A big idea?
- No, my robot. It hit me.

04:01.141 --> 04:03.911
So, I fixed that, too.
And that's when it hit me.

04:03.977 --> 04:08.416
- But I thought you fixed it.
- No, I got the big idea.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.352
Urkelbot needs a job.
And that's when it hit me.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.253
- Another big idea?
- No. My robot.

04:13.321 --> 04:16.424
I didn't fix him
after all.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.459
Would you just please
get to the point?

04:18.526 --> 04:22.663
Well, alright,
Mr. Antsy-pants.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.399
Alright. Here it goes.
Here is my big idea.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.602
Urkelbot should
become Urkelcop.

04:33.874 --> 04:37.177
Oh, what's the matter?
Don't you like my idea?

04:37.244 --> 04:38.912
Steve, you can't
be serious.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.148
A machine could
never make a good cop.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.484
Uh, and just
why in Sam Hill not?

04:43.551 --> 04:44.685
Well, a million reasons.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.820
For one, it-it
can't eat donuts.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.055
[mocking]

04:52.460 --> 04:54.595
That's enough,
Winslow.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.832
The lad might be
on to something here.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.401
He might?

05:00.468 --> 05:03.103
Yeah. If this robot
of his worked out

05:03.170 --> 05:07.541
it would make me look real good
and I'd get my promotion.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.943
It would also help
benefit society.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.513
It could help
millions of people.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.883
Why, it could change
the course of human history.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.118
Oh!

05:18.185 --> 05:20.320
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Whatever.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.060
[indistinct chattering]

05:29.329 --> 05:30.631
Hi.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.332
[indistinct chattering]

05:32.400 --> 05:33.567
Hello.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.003
[all]
Hi.

05:36.069 --> 05:40.207
Guess what, I have a chance
to make some real money.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.877
What about the money I pay you
for working at Rachel's place?

05:43.944 --> 05:47.080
No offence, but I said,
"Real money."

05:49.249 --> 05:53.621
I want to become a distributer
for Larnice Cosmetics.

05:53.687 --> 05:59.092
Ah. Larnice Cosmetics.
Never heard of them.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.462
Well, that's because
they are a new company.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.397
And they are looking
for distributors.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.599
And you know
I'm a good salesman.

06:05.666 --> 06:10.404
I mean, I can sell suntan lotion
to Michael Jackson.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.273
And all I need
to get started is 400 bucks.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.875
You have to send
them money?

06:14.942 --> 06:17.811
Well, yeah. They send me
$400 worth their cosmetics

06:17.878 --> 06:20.448
and I turn right around
and sell them for $800.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.816
-Everybody wins!
-Wait a minute.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.152
Do you have $400?

06:27.455 --> 06:29.523
Not quite.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.324
I know where
this is going.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.861
Yeah, straight
to our bank accounts.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.397
Look, I have 100. And if you
guys put in a 100 each

06:37.465 --> 06:39.633
we'd be equal partners,
I'd do all the work.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.201
I don't know,
Laura.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.471
Look, you know
money has been kinda scarce

06:43.537 --> 06:44.705
and coming up
with $100--

06:44.772 --> 06:47.675
Oh, come on, you tightwads.

06:47.741 --> 06:52.412
Laura is only asking
for 100 bucks, not a kidney.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.315
She is showing real
get-up-and-go.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.885
She is being
an entrepreneur.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.488
We should reward that kind
of an initiative.

07:00.554 --> 07:04.458
I'd say we write her
a check right now.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.995
- You're right. Come on.
- Come on. Take that.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.433
Thanks, everybody.

07:13.501 --> 07:18.205
Oh, ladies, I'm a little
short this month.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.641
Could one of you
put in my share?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.917
[humming]

07:37.324 --> 07:39.392
Okay. We are all set.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.129
- Good.
- It's about time.

07:42.195 --> 07:47.601
Now, in honor of the occasion
I've prepared a short speech.

07:47.668 --> 07:51.639
In the year of our lord, 1977

07:51.705 --> 07:54.174
the Urkel child was born.

07:56.376 --> 08:00.447
And on that day
that child was--

08:00.514 --> 08:02.482
Would you just please
show us the robot.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.653
Well, okay.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.721
But this is
no ordinary robot.

08:07.788 --> 08:12.526
This is the one,
the only, the absolutely amazing

08:12.593 --> 08:14.762
Urkel Cop!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.935
Okay, let's see.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.738
An official
police badge.

08:36.483 --> 08:37.818
[buzzing]

09:03.911 --> 09:06.947
Hasta la vista, baby.
He he he.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.921
Wow! Neo.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.324
Oh, please!
You can't be serious.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.959
Sir.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.195
Go ahead.
Test his knowledge.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.733
Okay. What's the first thing an
officer should do upon arriving

09:25.799 --> 09:27.968
at the scene
of a robbery in progress?

09:28.035 --> 09:30.103
[clunking]

09:30.170 --> 09:33.206
Call for back-up.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.076
Is that right?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.313
Yes, sir.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.983
Heh. I'm impressed.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.253
What? Okay, so he memorized
a few books. Big deal.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.389
But, sir, you and I
went to the police academy.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.424
We are properly trained.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.860
Well, so is Urkelbot.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.128
I guarantee you that
he's studied the best.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.396
Check it out.

09:56.463 --> 10:01.268
[Dirty Harry impression]
Go ahead, punk.
Make my day.

10:01.334 --> 10:05.839
[Kojack impression]
Who loves you, baby.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.842
[Joe Friday impression]
Just the facts, ma'am.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.244
Kid, this is
quite an achievement.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.780
Well, thank you, Lieu.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.382
Oh, feel free
to use word genius.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.350
Now, as the ranking officer here

10:17.417 --> 10:21.021
it falls upon my shoulders to
think of a way to use this robot

10:21.088 --> 10:23.190
to benefit me
and no one else.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.794
Winslow, say hello
to your new partner.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.164
What?

10:31.231 --> 10:33.233
I'm assigning you
to the mini-mart robberies.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.769
If you two can catch
the guy who's robbed

10:35.836 --> 10:40.240
18 convenience stores,
I'll get promoted to captain.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.276
If you mess up,
I've never heard of you.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.644
It's perfect.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.081
Come on, sergeant.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.184
Let's hit the mean streets and
kick some bad guy butt.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.131
Well, now, sir, listen,
I realize that this-this

11:04.197 --> 11:07.701
bucket of bolts is smart
and it talks a good game.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.971
But what is it going to do
when words fail

11:11.038 --> 11:14.207
and it's time
to get rough.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.809
[clunking]

11:39.933 --> 11:44.304
Any other questions,
Carl?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.975
On second thought, I'd be happy
to be his partner.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.985
I know.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.987
Well, that was a nice party.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.489
Margaret sure got some beautiful
gifts at her baby shower.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.525
Yeah. But now I don't know what
I'm gonna get her

12:05.592 --> 12:07.494
next month
for her wedding shower.

12:07.560 --> 12:12.365
I miss the old days when we took
our showers in the proper order.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.969
Oh, look.
Larnice sent us our cosmetics.

12:16.036 --> 12:21.508
Oh. Come on.
Open 'em up.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.011
Oh. Oh.

12:24.077 --> 12:28.015
Oh. Mmm, this shampoo
smells great.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.250
Oh, look, there is
a hair conditioner, too.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.285
Let's go try this stuff
out right now.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.355
Yeah. I can't wait to see
how my hair comes out.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.031
[screaming]

13:06.453 --> 13:08.221
[all screaming]

13:18.031 --> 13:20.033
Hey, what's
all the noise down here?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.768
What's all the racket?

13:21.835 --> 13:23.403
Hi, how are you?

13:30.210 --> 13:34.247
- Harriette?
- Carl, look at me!

13:34.314 --> 13:36.316
Do I have to?

13:38.451 --> 13:44.391
I'm sorry, honey,
but...but you're bald.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.328
And so is my daughter.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.362
[screaming]

13:50.797 --> 13:53.700
And so is my mother.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.104
What happened to you guys?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.239
Larnice Cosmetics
is what happened to us.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.241
We all used
that stupid shampoo.

14:01.308 --> 14:04.211
Oh, I don't get it.
I mean I used that shampoo.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.713
And my hair is fine.
See.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.181
[screaming]

14:11.018 --> 14:13.253
I'm gonna call
this Larnice company

14:13.320 --> 14:16.123
and yell at them
what happened.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.358
Well, Laura, where did you
hear about this company?

14:18.425 --> 14:21.661
Well, they had a full page ad
in a reputable magazine.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.597
-Which magazine?
-Funky Rap!

14:29.102 --> 14:32.239
Listen to this.
Try Larnice shampoo.

14:32.305 --> 14:36.476
You'll love
how your hair comes out.

14:36.543 --> 14:41.781
Well, you can't get her
for false advertising.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.583
[mocking]

14:50.523 --> 14:53.393
We're sorry, mom. Uh, we realize
that you're upset.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.696
But, hey, look
on the bright side.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.499
You all could be backup singers
for Sinead O'Connor.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.001
[mocking]

15:09.376 --> 15:11.911
I don't understand. Their number
is no longer in service.

15:11.979 --> 15:15.115
Well, I hate to tell you this,
sweetheart, but I believe

15:15.182 --> 15:16.149
you've been swindled.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.750
What do you mean?

15:17.817 --> 15:21.688
Larnice cosmetics is obviously
a fly-by-night operation.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.024
They probably sold
hundreds of distributorships

15:24.091 --> 15:26.593
took the money and ran.

15:26.659 --> 15:30.530
You guys, I'm really sorry
about this.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.100
It-It just seemed like
such a great deal.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.536
Sweetheart, if something seems
too good to be true

15:36.603 --> 15:38.205
it probably is.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.008
Look, look. I've got to hurry up
and get dressed

15:41.074 --> 15:44.344
and get down
to the wig barn.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.113
Well, hey,
I'll drive you all.

15:46.179 --> 15:49.949
Let's just calm down
and have some breakfast.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.118
That's a good idea.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.086
You know,
I don't know why

15:53.153 --> 15:55.989
but suddenly
I'm in a mood for melon.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.324
[mocking]

16:19.479 --> 16:21.814
Excuse me.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.451
Sir.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.120
[Indian accent]
Oh, may I help you
very much?

16:29.922 --> 16:32.292
Uh, yeah.
I'd like to pay for this soda.

16:32.359 --> 16:35.128
Ooh, paying
is very very good.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.799
Bless you very much.

16:39.866 --> 16:43.636
And as they say at the border in
my country, please, come back.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.810
Hey, that's
a great accent, big guy.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.645
Ooh, thank you very..

16:52.712 --> 16:54.681
[normal voice]
Thank you very much, Steve.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.584
But I still say this is
a complete waste of time.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.619
I mean,
the odds of this place

16:59.686 --> 17:02.189
being robbed tonight
are one in a million.

17:02.255 --> 17:06.326
Correction.
The odds are one in three.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.361
Where does he
get this stuff?

17:08.428 --> 17:11.198
Triangulation.
Urkelbot marked on a map

17:11.264 --> 17:13.166
the locations
of the previous robberies.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.834
I detected a pattern

17:14.901 --> 17:18.405
and deduced the most logical
spot to be hit next.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.840
And here we are
at Pete's shop 'n save.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.209
Rightarooney.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.844
Well, now that you've got
your metal man set up

17:24.911 --> 17:26.479
why don't you head home, Steve?

17:26.546 --> 17:27.580
[door opening]

17:30.517 --> 17:32.852
So, let me
get this straight.

17:32.919 --> 17:37.590
You have three flavors of
antacid, Mr. night manager.

17:37.657 --> 17:42.595
A person I have never met before
in my entire life.

17:42.662 --> 17:47.334
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Cherry, lemon and goofy grape.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.069
Now go home,
small man.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.404
Ishmadaddle.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.473
Nobody moves,
nobody gets hurt.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.742
Oh.

17:55.808 --> 18:00.613
You! Empty the cash register!
You! Get me a cherry slurpy!

18:05.017 --> 18:08.188
- What size?
- Surprise me.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.258
- Put the cash in a bag.
- Uh, paper or plastic?

18:11.324 --> 18:14.494
- Just do it.
- Uh, as you wish.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.813
- Freeze, dog breath!
- What?

18:33.880 --> 18:36.983
You're under arrest. You have
the right to remain silent.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.419
You have the right
to have an attorney present.

18:39.486 --> 18:43.323
Shut up!
What are you?

18:43.390 --> 18:46.793
I'm your
worst nightmare.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.762
Oh, yeah?

18:49.829 --> 18:51.598
[gunshots]

18:59.206 --> 19:02.309
I believe
these belong to you.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.579
[grunting]

19:18.258 --> 19:21.661
[Terminator impression]
Hasta la vista, baby!

19:30.270 --> 19:33.072
You are busted,
pal.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.607
Thank you
very much.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.444
Whatever. Just keep that
hunk of junk away from me.

19:37.510 --> 19:41.214
So, you are not so bad
without your gun

19:41.281 --> 19:43.550
Mr. Gimme-a-slurpy.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.960
Yeah, then I slapped the cuffs
on and took him right downtown.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.928
Alright, Carl.
That's great.

19:55.995 --> 20:01.133
And I participated, Laura.
Feel like kissing a hero?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.303
- I sure do.
- Oh.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.877
Listen, Steve, when our hair
grows back, do you think

20:10.943 --> 20:13.179
Urkelbot can analyze
a sample and track down

20:13.246 --> 20:15.047
those jokers
who did this to us.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.584
And snatch them bald.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.820
Well, he could,
but he can't, so he won't.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.389
What?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.957
Well, Urklebot has decided
to give-up police work.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.559
He finds it too dangerous.

20:26.626 --> 20:30.096
So, he has decided
to become a dancer.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.932
-A dancing robot?
-Oh, yes. Yes.

20:32.999 --> 20:36.403
It was such a peachy idea, I
decided to build him a partner.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.904
Wait a minute.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.507
Are you saying that you built
a mechanical women?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.409
That's right.
Oh, and Laura

20:42.475 --> 20:47.079
I averted my eyes during
the final welding, sweetheart.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.681
Glad to hear it, Steve.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.818
I named my new robot
after you, Laura.

20:51.884 --> 20:55.588
I call it Laurabot.

20:56.889 --> 21:00.092
Gee, Steve,
If I cared, I'd be honored.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.561
Oh.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.864
Steve, are these robot dancers
of yours any good?

21:04.931 --> 21:08.067
Well, you tell me.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.669
Well, come on.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.179
Ready to dance,
Urkelbot?

21:20.246 --> 21:24.684
Let's get down
with our bad selves.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.887
[music playing]

22:04.424 --> 22:05.692
[theme music]
