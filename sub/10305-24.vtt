WEBVTT

00:10.929 --> 00:11.998
These aren't bad.

00:12.209 --> 00:13.847
Great. I'll ring them right up.

00:14.049 --> 00:15.607
But I don't love them.

00:15.809 --> 00:19.165
Let's put them in the "maybe" pile.

00:19.369 --> 00:21.599
Ma'am, my back is killing me.

00:21.809 --> 00:25.279
Unfortunately, not fast enough.

00:25.489 --> 00:28.367
I just don't see anything I like.

00:28.569 --> 00:30.685
You ought to be sitting on this stool.

00:35.609 --> 00:38.362
Got more shoes
for our delightful customer.

00:38.569 --> 00:39.718
She's gone.

00:39.929 --> 00:41.999
Picky bitch.

00:44.369 --> 00:47.759
- Are you talking to me?
- No, no, no. I'm talking to him.

00:47.969 --> 00:49.687
Picky bitch.

00:51.889 --> 00:55.325
Well, I see, as usual, you have outdone
yourselves with the store display.

00:55.529 --> 00:57.360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:57.569 --> 01:00.481
Listen, morons,
I've decided to restock the store.

01:00.689 --> 01:03.044
So I'm donating
all of these old shoes...

01:03.249 --> 01:05.524
...to poor Filipino orphans.

01:05.729 --> 01:08.641
Well, they made them,
why would they want them back?

01:09.369 --> 01:10.927
Just pack them up.

01:11.129 --> 01:12.721
Excuse me, I've got to go shopping.

01:12.929 --> 01:15.921
I'm going on a cruise,
and I wanna look good.

01:16.129 --> 01:21.123
For her to look good, she'd have
to stand next to a real ugly tuna.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.728
Hi, got your lunch.

01:23.929 --> 01:25.760
- Oh, good.
- Thank you.

01:25.969 --> 01:28.563
- Griff, give her the money.
- I don't have any money.

01:28.769 --> 01:29.997
Well, I don't have
any money.

01:30.209 --> 01:33.918
Well, you know,
I could take those sandals instead.

01:34.129 --> 01:36.324
You know, a little trade?

01:36.529 --> 01:37.518
Hey...

01:37.969 --> 01:39.368
- You got a deal.
- Cool.

01:39.569 --> 01:42.402
And while you're at it,
take yourself a pair of Peds.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.489 --> 02:27.801
All right, Lucky,
the dishes are all done.

02:32.969 --> 02:35.961
Now it's time to do Al's laundry.

02:43.009 --> 02:46.558
Oh, yeah? Well, anyone who doesn't
think Delta Burke is a major talent...

02:46.769 --> 02:49.203
...is someone
I don't wanna do business with.

02:51.169 --> 02:52.488
Hey.

02:56.929 --> 02:59.682
Guess what.
I finally got my masseuse licence.

02:59.889 --> 03:01.163
You know what that means?

03:01.649 --> 03:04.322
You can rub men
and finally get paid for it?

03:06.009 --> 03:09.240
No, master of self-massage...

03:11.449 --> 03:14.998
...it means, as a licensed masseuse,
I can make some money-

03:15.649 --> 03:18.402
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right, huh?

03:19.289 --> 03:22.440
So, Mom, you look pretty stressed.
Do you wanna go first?

03:25.729 --> 03:27.640
Well, I guess Mom can wait.

03:27.849 --> 03:28.998
How about you?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.403
Well, I am a little tense.

03:30.889 --> 03:33.881
Getting Delta Burke a job isn't as easy
as I thought it would be.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.319
Here, hop on the table. Come on.

03:37.769 --> 03:40.363
- All right.
- All right, let's see.

03:40.609 --> 03:42.201
Okay.

03:42.849 --> 03:44.202
Oh, Kelly, that feels good.

03:44.409 --> 03:47.003
Yeah. See, the key to it is pressure.

03:47.209 --> 03:50.246
Because if you press
in the wrong place, you could-

03:53.329 --> 03:56.401
You could really hurt someone.
Here, let's try this one.

03:56.609 --> 03:59.521
- No, stop. Kelly, stop. Please.
- It's really a good one though.

04:02.169 --> 04:05.878
Well, there's a sound
I haven't heard before.

04:06.089 --> 04:08.319
Oh, my God. I can't move my legs.

04:08.529 --> 04:10.759
I can't move my legs.

04:12.689 --> 04:14.361
That's not true.

04:14.569 --> 04:16.764
They're twitching.

04:17.969 --> 04:20.880
I really, really think
I'm gonna need some help here.

04:21.089 --> 04:24.638
Okay. Well, I guess I better
go take another lesson then, huh?

04:24.849 --> 04:26.601
- Okay, bye.
- No, Kelly. Don't leave!

04:26.809 --> 04:28.367
Kelly, don't leave, please!

04:28.769 --> 04:29.884
Mom!

04:43.049 --> 04:45.847
You know, this bartering stuff is great.

04:46.049 --> 04:50.008
I wonder why people didn't think
of this thousands of years ago.

04:50.209 --> 04:51.961
You know, it's kind of hard
to barter...

04:52.169 --> 04:54.239
<i>...when you got a T. rex
chasing your ass.</i>

04:57.329 --> 04:58.478
Hey.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.281
This here looks expensive, huh?

05:02.769 --> 05:05.681
My back is killing me.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.005
The view is killing me.

05:09.569 --> 05:10.718
Hey.

05:10.929 --> 05:12.442
How come this chair...

05:12.649 --> 05:14.958
...has an on-and-off switch?

05:15.169 --> 05:18.957
Because that
is the Swedish Ecstasy 5000.

05:19.169 --> 05:21.285
This massage chair is so amazing...

05:21.489 --> 05:24.208
...other massage chairs sit in it
when they want to relax.

05:26.209 --> 05:27.403
Some people say...

05:27.609 --> 05:31.522
...the Swedish Ecstasy 5000
is almost as good as sex.

05:32.129 --> 05:34.085
They're crazy.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.885
It's much better.

05:38.489 --> 05:42.004
- We'll take it.
- Well, that will be $3000.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.198
Three thousand dollars?

05:43.409 --> 05:46.242
For that we could have actual sex
with Swedish girls.

05:46.449 --> 05:47.438
Yeah.

05:47.649 --> 05:51.244
Yes. Well, maybe we couldn't,
but some guys could.

05:51.969 --> 05:54.005
That's another great feature
of this chair.

05:54.209 --> 05:55.961
- It will never say no to you.
- Yeah.

05:56.169 --> 05:59.479
Spit on you and call you a shoe man.

05:59.689 --> 06:01.247
Or lard butt.

06:01.449 --> 06:03.360
Or spoon-billed.

06:03.569 --> 06:05.161
Well, that only happened once.

06:06.529 --> 06:08.759
My friend, you're in luck.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.960
We're in the barter business.

06:11.169 --> 06:14.798
Now, how many shoes would you take
for this here chair?

06:15.009 --> 06:18.319
One. As long as there's
$3000 stuffed in it.

06:18.529 --> 06:20.997
Come on. We're both mall guys.

06:21.209 --> 06:23.120
What would you take for that chair?

06:23.329 --> 06:28.005
Well, it's too bad you guys don't work
in the sporting goods store...

06:28.529 --> 06:31.487
...because I'd trade that chair
for a set of graphite golf clubs.

06:32.209 --> 06:33.278
That can be arranged.

06:36.289 --> 06:37.563
So, what do you say?

06:37.769 --> 06:40.237
I say I'll give you the clubs...

06:40.449 --> 06:43.361
...for 50 pairs of stiletto heels.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.480
Size 12.

06:54.169 --> 06:55.648
Don't ask.

06:57.609 --> 07:00.282
Who are we to judge?

07:01.729 --> 07:03.845
And a push-up bra.

07:07.729 --> 07:10.004
Maybe we'll judge a little.

07:10.849 --> 07:12.328
Deal.

07:15.609 --> 07:16.758
Okay.

07:16.969 --> 07:18.322
Now, Bud...

07:18.529 --> 07:20.565
...can you feel this?

07:24.809 --> 07:26.720
No.

07:28.529 --> 07:29.962
All right.

07:30.609 --> 07:31.883
How about this?

07:34.569 --> 07:36.924
That's good. That's good.
It means it hasn't spread.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.685
Kelly, I'm in a lot of pain here.

07:41.889 --> 07:43.322
Oh, and I'm not?

07:43.529 --> 07:46.441
Do you have any idea
what watching Oprah at this angle...

07:46.649 --> 07:49.083
...is doing to my neck?

07:49.569 --> 07:53.039
Mommy, please call the doctor.

07:53.249 --> 07:55.638
Oh, what good's a doctor, Bud?
All they're gonna do...

07:55.849 --> 07:58.238
...is stick you with needles
and check your temperature.

07:58.449 --> 08:00.405
Speaking of which...

08:02.569 --> 08:06.084
Well, if you were a pot roast,
you'd be done by now.

08:07.169 --> 08:09.000
Don't worry, Bud.

08:13.489 --> 08:14.524
I'm here to help.

08:14.729 --> 08:18.005
I've been in more massage parlours
than anyone in the world.

08:19.129 --> 08:21.040
All right, I think I have an idea.

08:21.249 --> 08:22.841
Put Bud on the table.

08:23.049 --> 08:24.004
- All right.
- All right.

08:24.209 --> 08:26.279
Why-? What-? No, I don't-

08:28.089 --> 08:29.647
Okay. Now what?

08:29.849 --> 08:32.443
Nothing. I just wanted the couch.

08:34.489 --> 08:35.443
All right, Bud.

08:35.649 --> 08:39.039
Here we go. Here we go.
Now, this is a little something...

08:39.249 --> 08:42.605
...that I picked up in a massage parlour
in the Far East.

08:42.808 --> 08:46.404
Well, actually, I picked up
a few things in that massage parlour...

08:46.609 --> 08:49.521
...but this is one
that I can pass on to you.

08:51.249 --> 08:52.887
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

08:53.089 --> 08:56.843
Okay, now, Bud, I am going
to manipulate your vertebrae...

08:57.049 --> 08:58.926
...while twisting your neck clockwise.

08:59.129 --> 09:00.960
- Oh, be careful.
- Here we go. And...

09:04.089 --> 09:06.887
Or was that counter clockwise?

09:10.009 --> 09:13.718
Oh, God, now I can't move at all!

09:16.009 --> 09:19.638
Well, on the plus side, you clot well.

09:21.649 --> 09:25.403
Al, don't you think all this trading
is getting a little out of hand?

09:25.609 --> 09:27.122
What do you mean?

09:37.289 --> 09:40.406
Oh, just a hunch.

09:40.609 --> 09:42.759
<i>Very simple, Griff.</i>

09:42.969 --> 09:45.483
To get the chair,
we had to get the golf clubs.

09:45.689 --> 09:48.283
To get the golf clubs,
we had to get that push-up bra.

09:48.489 --> 09:51.561
To get the push-up bra,
we had to give them the kayak...

09:51.769 --> 09:54.920
...and that apology for the detour
through the fitting room.

09:55.569 --> 09:59.482
Now all we need to do
is get this driving mower to the Gap...

09:59.689 --> 10:02.567
...and Mr. Zippy the chimp
to Hickory Farms.

10:05.489 --> 10:08.003
I hope they don't let him roll
the cheese logs.

10:09.449 --> 10:12.407
Hi, I need a pair of shoes.

10:12.609 --> 10:14.406
Well, what are you doing here?

10:16.489 --> 10:19.367
You need shoes,
you go to the Hallmark store.

10:20.209 --> 10:23.087
And if you need pantyhose,
you gotta go to the Beef Bowl.

10:25.289 --> 10:26.847
Good day.

10:30.209 --> 10:32.518
Al, are you sure
this is gonna work out?

10:32.729 --> 10:35.926
Trust me. I've thought of everything.
Nothing can go wrong.

10:37.369 --> 10:39.599
- Freeze.
- You're busted.

10:44.849 --> 10:47.238
What did we do?

10:48.129 --> 10:53.601
You're in violation of Mall Code 274,
illegal bartering.

10:54.249 --> 10:56.046
Bar- Bar- Bartering?

10:56.249 --> 10:58.717
But who's bartering?

10:59.129 --> 11:01.120
Then what's all this merchandise
doing here?

11:01.329 --> 11:02.284
Well, if you...

11:02.849 --> 11:06.922
...wipe the Clearasil
out of your eyes, officer...

11:07.129 --> 11:09.006
<i>...you would have seen
that the sign says:</i>

11:09.209 --> 11:11.962
"Gary's Shoes and Accessories. "

11:12.169 --> 11:15.400
See, all this stuff,
they're accessories.

11:16.649 --> 11:18.207
A barbecue grill?

11:18.569 --> 11:20.525
Well, sure, maybe to you...

11:20.729 --> 11:24.881
...but to a discriminating consumer,
this is...

11:25.089 --> 11:27.557
...a foot warmer.

11:27.769 --> 11:30.920
All right, that makes sense.

11:33.129 --> 11:35.165
But what about this?

11:35.369 --> 11:36.802
That is...

11:37.009 --> 11:39.364
That's for our customer lounge.

11:40.569 --> 11:43.129
Welcome to the shoe room,
gentlemen.

11:44.369 --> 11:46.325
Any requests?

11:50.049 --> 11:51.402
Come on, Bundy.

11:51.609 --> 11:53.201
Hey, hey, hey.
Keep your voice down.

11:53.409 --> 11:54.842
There's no reason to shout.

11:59.209 --> 12:01.484
Come on,
we all work in the same mall.

12:01.689 --> 12:03.122
Why are you giving me the shaft?

12:10.929 --> 12:13.602
Let's take five, Little Stevie.

12:14.369 --> 12:17.327
Now, listen, I know that you guys
are just doing your job...

12:17.529 --> 12:20.646
...you know,
between doughnut runs...

12:21.009 --> 12:23.239
...but let's talk about
a little payola, you know?

12:23.449 --> 12:25.246
A little greasing of the wheel.

12:25.449 --> 12:28.168
A little something
for the widows and orphans fund.

12:29.289 --> 12:30.961
No way, Bundy.

12:31.169 --> 12:32.602
We want free stuff.

12:33.049 --> 12:34.084
And...

12:34.809 --> 12:37.721
...Griff plays
at the Mall Policeman's Ball.

12:38.889 --> 12:40.481
Deal.

12:40.689 --> 12:44.204
As long as it's not on Saturday.
See, I booked me a bar mitzvah.

12:45.969 --> 12:47.402
Stop that!

12:47.609 --> 12:49.361
Come on, Bud,
you have to cooperate...

12:49.569 --> 12:51.844
...or we're not gonna take you
to the chiropractor.

12:52.049 --> 12:54.279
Oh, are you sure he's good?

12:54.489 --> 12:56.923
Of course he's good.
His office is in the mall.

12:57.129 --> 12:59.279
- Come on, let's hurry up.
- Here we go.

12:59.489 --> 13:01.286
Okay, okay.

13:01.529 --> 13:02.518
- Okay.
- That's good.

13:02.729 --> 13:05.402
There you go, buddy.
It should work.

13:05.609 --> 13:09.841
Need I remind you people
that we have to go through a tunnel?

13:10.049 --> 13:13.166
Someone's cranky.

13:13.849 --> 13:16.124
All right. Let's put him in the trunk.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.523
- Yeah.
- Okay. Here we go.

13:17.729 --> 13:20.004
No, no, no.
That's not a good idea.

13:20.209 --> 13:22.040
Why, you can't even feel your legs.

13:22.249 --> 13:24.638
- The trunk is not a good idea.
- Yes, it is.

13:24.849 --> 13:27.124
Come on, Bud, you didn't mind
going in the trunk...

13:27.329 --> 13:32.722
...when we had to go to the drive-in
or grandma's or California.

13:32.929 --> 13:34.521
- Get the trunk.
- Well, push over.

13:34.729 --> 13:37.243
Stop, I don't want-
I'm not getting in the trunk.

13:39.849 --> 13:42.079
No. Don't even-!

13:45.089 --> 13:46.283
I'm sorry, Bud.

13:47.009 --> 13:48.408
Let me out.

13:48.729 --> 13:51.197
His legs are moving.

13:51.409 --> 13:53.525
You big faker.

13:54.929 --> 13:56.806
All right, look. I have a better idea.

13:57.009 --> 13:58.362
Take him out of the trunk.

13:58.569 --> 14:00.366
- All right.
- Come on.

14:00.569 --> 14:03.163
Come on, Bud. Oh, jeez.

14:03.889 --> 14:05.242
Hey, this is a great idea...

14:05.449 --> 14:07.804
...tying Bud to the roof.

14:08.009 --> 14:10.887
- You said tie him to the roof?
- Yeah.

14:11.089 --> 14:13.887
I thought you said put him in a tie.

14:15.209 --> 14:16.927
Oh, no.

14:21.289 --> 14:24.087
Slow down.

14:24.849 --> 14:26.077
What'd he say?

14:26.289 --> 14:29.725
- I think he said stop.
- Okay.

14:32.929 --> 14:35.443
Oh, that had to hurt.

14:42.249 --> 14:45.605
Well, I hope you enjoy
your Bustisizer.

14:47.129 --> 14:48.721
I sure have.

14:52.289 --> 14:55.599
Al, your chair is here.

14:58.729 --> 14:59.878
Gary's Shoes.

15:00.569 --> 15:02.719
Well, Gary's.

15:04.409 --> 15:06.877
Hello, chair.

15:09.369 --> 15:12.167
Al, we're in big trouble.
That was Gary.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.486
She found out that retro was in,
and she wants all the shoes back.

15:15.689 --> 15:17.964
But we gave all those shoes away.

15:18.329 --> 15:19.762
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

15:19.969 --> 15:21.482
This is all your fault, Griff.

15:21.689 --> 15:24.965
My fault? This was all your idea.

15:25.169 --> 15:28.002
Hey, now, let's not place blame here.

15:28.689 --> 15:30.168
How we gonna get the shoes back?

15:30.369 --> 15:32.360
Well, we've gotta trade
for everything back.

15:32.569 --> 15:33.718
Including the chair.

15:33.929 --> 15:36.238
- Not the chair.
- Al...

15:36.769 --> 15:39.442
...what good is a massage chair
gonna do you in prison...

15:39.649 --> 15:42.447
...when a guy named Lava Joe
has just made you his bride?

15:49.049 --> 15:51.358
I love this store.

15:51.569 --> 15:53.639
What about the chiropractor?

15:53.889 --> 15:56.403
Bud, you saw those prices.

15:56.609 --> 15:58.565
We're not made out of money,
you know.

15:58.769 --> 16:00.282
Oh, look.

16:00.489 --> 16:03.208
A titanium showerhead.

16:03.409 --> 16:05.718
Oh, and it's only $400.

16:05.929 --> 16:08.124
I'll take it.

16:08.329 --> 16:11.366
This is the worst day of my life.

16:11.809 --> 16:13.527
Well, I guess it's okay to tell you...

16:13.729 --> 16:16.289
...that Delta Burke called
and she fired you.

16:16.529 --> 16:17.962
I'm sorry.

16:19.369 --> 16:22.247
It doesn't get any lower than that.

16:23.729 --> 16:26.038
Hey, Bud...

16:26.249 --> 16:28.558
...you know what I do...

16:29.209 --> 16:31.404
...when I'm feeling blue?

16:31.609 --> 16:33.327
I tan my troubles away.

16:33.529 --> 16:34.644
Oh, that's a good idea.

16:34.849 --> 16:36.805
There you go, sweetie.
There you go.

16:37.489 --> 16:39.286
I don't know
if this is such a good idea.

16:39.489 --> 16:41.605
See, I'm fair-skinned.

16:43.289 --> 16:44.517
Foosball.

16:44.729 --> 16:45.764
Best three out of two?

16:45.969 --> 16:47.607
- You're on.
- Okay.

16:51.569 --> 16:52.843
Hey, Bundy...

16:53.049 --> 16:54.277
...love the clubs.

16:54.489 --> 16:56.923
Hey, that's good.
Give them back to us.

16:57.129 --> 16:59.927
No way. They've taken
eight strokes off my game.

17:00.129 --> 17:03.121
But see, we traded back everything
we traded for for the chair.

17:03.329 --> 17:06.685
Even Mr. Zippy the chimp,
who didn't wanna go.

17:07.529 --> 17:11.317
And I'm not ashamed to say it,
I'm gonna miss the little fellow.

17:12.249 --> 17:14.809
So be a pal, help us out.

17:15.009 --> 17:17.284
But we're not pals.

17:17.489 --> 17:20.162
I don't like you.

17:20.368 --> 17:23.088
But I like you.

17:27.449 --> 17:28.882
Beat it.

17:30.889 --> 17:32.242
Hey, Peg.

17:32.449 --> 17:33.598
What are you doing up?

17:33.809 --> 17:35.527
Well...

17:35.729 --> 17:38.243
...one of us has to be
an attentive parent.

17:38.449 --> 17:42.203
Bud is in serious trouble. He's-

17:45.009 --> 17:46.761
He's burning.

17:48.369 --> 17:49.722
Sorry, Bud, we...

17:49.929 --> 17:53.365
Oh, we kind of lost track of time.

17:55.009 --> 17:56.727
But...

17:57.329 --> 17:58.728
Gee, you...

17:58.929 --> 18:00.920
You look great.

18:02.889 --> 18:05.323
You smell like chicken.

18:06.609 --> 18:08.042
Bud boy?

18:08.249 --> 18:10.080
Daddy. Dad?

18:10.289 --> 18:13.361
They're trying to kill me,
you know?

18:13.569 --> 18:16.561
Welcome to my world, son.

18:21.609 --> 18:24.169
All right.
What did you do to the boy?

18:24.569 --> 18:26.799
Well, I massaged him and then-

18:27.009 --> 18:28.567
And now he can't walk.

18:28.769 --> 18:30.487
You massaged him...

18:30.689 --> 18:33.078
...and now he's paralysed.

18:33.849 --> 18:36.238
Great. I got a good idea.
Help me here.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.485
- Bud, come here, son.
- What are you doing?

18:38.689 --> 18:40.645
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of you.

18:40.849 --> 18:42.885
Get him over to the chair.
Come on over here.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.922
Easy, boy. There.

18:46.129 --> 18:48.563
Attention, mall shoppers.

18:48.769 --> 18:51.237
You see what this chair
did to my only son?

18:51.449 --> 18:53.360
It paralysed him...

18:53.569 --> 18:56.129
...and it burned him.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.238
Cut him down in his prime.

18:59.449 --> 19:02.043
All thanks to this evil chair.

19:02.249 --> 19:04.968
What the hell
are you guys trying to pull?

19:05.169 --> 19:08.286
I'm trying to save
my sorry son's life.

19:09.009 --> 19:09.998
Hey, Dad...

19:10.209 --> 19:12.359
...I think I'm starting to be able
to move here.

19:13.049 --> 19:17.122
Oh, my spine!

19:17.329 --> 19:18.887
All right. All right.

19:19.089 --> 19:22.001
Take the clubs.
Just get the hell out of here.

19:22.209 --> 19:23.358
Come on, Griff, let's go.

19:23.569 --> 19:26.720
A pleasure doing business
with you, sir.

19:32.049 --> 19:34.722
My skin is fried.

19:35.929 --> 19:39.888
Well, here,
maybe this will cool you off.

19:40.089 --> 19:41.408
That's not gonna work.

19:41.609 --> 19:43.122
Here.

19:43.329 --> 19:44.728
No-

19:44.929 --> 19:46.487
Kelly!

19:50.009 --> 19:53.922
Thank you, Kelly. That felt real good.

20:11.449 --> 20:13.280
Well, just as I suspected...

20:13.489 --> 20:17.164
...you two slugs haven't moved
a muscle since I left.

20:17.369 --> 20:19.837
Jeez, you guys could get
some exercise.

20:20.049 --> 20:24.122
It's just that your beauty
has left us breathless.

20:25.169 --> 20:26.522
You'll have to wait in line...

20:26.729 --> 20:30.608
...because I met a special someone
on that cruise. He's picking me up.

20:30.809 --> 20:33.004
I just need a minute
to make myself pretty.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.287
She's gonna need a little bit more
than a minute, huh?

20:41.089 --> 20:43.557
Al, you sure you cleared out
all that stuff back there?

20:43.769 --> 20:44.997
Yes, I'm sure.

20:54.809 --> 20:57.960
That's one desperate
little chimp, huh?

21:06.849 --> 21:09.761
<i>Don't go away, we'll be right back.</i>

21:11.969 --> 21:14.358
I told you, I'm in a hurry.
