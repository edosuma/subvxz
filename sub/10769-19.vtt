00:02.669 --> 00:05.433
<i>But it'll cut into my trick or treat...
Ha, ha, ha.</i>

00:06.606 --> 00:07.937
<i>Here we go.</i>

00:08.108 --> 00:11.669
<i>But it'll cut into my trick or treat...
Ha, ha, ha. I can't do it.</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:14.245
<i>I'm just gonna say my line and go.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:22.513
<i>But it'll cut into my trick or treat...
Ha, ha, ha.</i>

00:24.824 --> 00:28.851
<i>- What are you doing? Ha, ha, ha.
- I can't get it out. Ha, ha, ha.</i>

00:31.798 --> 00:34.028
Boy, you stupid. That boy's so dumb.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.169
Cut, cut, cut.

00:39.272 --> 00:41.797
Hey, Dick Clark,
what you doing here, man?

00:41.975 --> 00:44.569
- You're doing a blooper show, aren't you?
- Well, yeah.

00:44.744 --> 00:49.238
Yeah, but you're doing it all wrong.
You can't just jump into a blooper show.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.980
- Man, what you know about bloopers?
- I think I know a thing or two.

00:53.153 --> 00:56.179
Let me, uh... Let me break you off
a little something here.

00:56.423 --> 01:00.120
First of all, you gotta have a concept.

01:00.693 --> 01:05.254
Okay. Okay.
You mean like naked-bikini-model bloopers.

01:06.366 --> 01:07.993
That's a little off topic.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.932
How about something maybe related
to the show?

01:11.938 --> 01:16.136
That is exactly why you the king, man.
Heh, heh, heh.

<i>Hey, hey, what's up, y'all?
Here we are at The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</i>

02:42.428 --> 02:45.397
And I'm about to take you
on a special behind-the-scenes tour.

02:45.565 --> 02:48.796
Right now we're at NBC, you know,
kind of my home away from home.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.198
Forgot my pass today,
but it don't matter none.

02:51.371 --> 02:54.397
I'm like royalty around here,
you know what I'm talking about?

02:55.909 --> 02:58.309
Hey, hey, brother. Brother.
Brother, come on.

02:58.478 --> 03:01.572
What about the march?
What about the march?

03:05.818 --> 03:08.844
Yeah. Well, they was...
They was just playing, you know?

03:09.022 --> 03:11.354
They do that all the time, you know.

03:11.524 --> 03:15.187
But come on, let's go inside. Let's check
to see what's going on on the set.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.659
You know, backstage and all that.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.161
Whoo! Ha, ha.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.165
What's up, y'all? Welcome to backstage.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.328
Everybody ain't allowed back here,
but I'm hooking y'all up, see?

03:26.506 --> 03:30.203
This is where we keep Makeup, Hair,
Wardrobe and our dressing rooms and stuff.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.469
You know what?
Let's go to James Avery's room.

03:32.645 --> 03:35.011
He plays Uncle Phil on the show.
Look, look. See?

03:35.181 --> 03:37.274
"James Avery."

03:37.717 --> 03:40.311
His room number is 1730.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.954
I think that's the year he was born.

03:48.294 --> 03:52.321
Look at him. Fronting.
He know he can't read.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.557
Yo, James. What's up, brother?
What's going on, man?

03:55.735 --> 03:58.033
Hey, say what's up to the people.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.631
- What's up?
- Ha, ha, ha.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.332
See? Now, we had all our dressing rooms
hooked up...

04:03.509 --> 04:07.070
...to match our personalities, you know?
And this here is James' personality.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.978
You know, it's like early-American wino.
That kind of thing he's got going.

04:11.150 --> 04:15.086
You know, look. Oh, you know, he got
his Billie Holiday picture up on the wall.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.019
A little Charlie "Bird" Parker, you know.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.284
Boy, I'm telling you,
this man got mad flavor.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.327
And let me tell you,
he is a consummate professional.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.555
Ha, ha. That's very kind of you.

04:25.732 --> 04:30.260
You know what? I don't ever remember
that man missing a line. Ever.

04:30.803 --> 04:34.364
What am I about... What I'm about to do...
What I'm about... What I'm about...

04:34.540 --> 04:36.974
What am I about... What am I about...
What am I about...

04:37.377 --> 04:39.641
Would you just set this mess up?

04:39.812 --> 04:41.871
What is it? I'm sorry.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.950
I'm trying. God knows I'm trying.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.983
Grab the list away from Will.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.519
Almost made it.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.351
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.720
When... When...
When are you gonna come in?

04:54.894 --> 04:56.521
What happened? You missed your place?

04:56.696 --> 04:57.685
Thank you.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.593
When... When...
When are you gonna come in?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.667
Boy, boy, boy.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.638
Boy, boy, boy.

05:12.478 --> 05:18.348
So, Robert, you know anything about, uh,
fixing this line that I'm screwing up?

05:18.885 --> 05:22.048
Keeping money that's not yours
is wrong.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.550
- Was that right?
- That was it!

05:31.064 --> 05:34.261
Boy, I'm telling you right now.
Look, see, James' room is fly, right?

05:34.434 --> 05:38.564
He got his cabinet here and all this stuff.
This is where he keep his shoes and stuff.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.797
Let's see what he got up in here.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.643
Boy, I bet Noah could've used
one of these Johns.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.907
You know what I'm talking about?
Ha, ha, ha.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.641
Ha, ha, ha. He's really funny.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.218
But you know, Will, ha, ha, ha...

05:54.387 --> 05:56.651
...I really want you out of my room.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.527
I'll see you before the show, James.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.265
Oh, hey. You know, I know.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.632
Hey, let's go see what Alfonso's doing
in Wardrobe.

06:15.007 --> 06:16.406
Here we are. This is Wardrobe.

06:16.576 --> 06:19.636
This is where they keep all our clothes
and all that kind of stuff.

06:19.812 --> 06:23.748
Oh, see?
Right here is a pair of Alfonso's pants.

06:25.017 --> 06:28.214
Hey, you know...
Hey, I think he's in here. Let's go see.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.422
Hey, hey!

06:32.191 --> 06:34.091
Y'all don't wanna see that.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.191
Hey, come here, come here, come here.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.830
See, now,
this is where the wardrobe designers...

06:38.998 --> 06:41.432
...put together all the ideas
and stuff like that...

06:41.601 --> 06:44.263
...that they want Alfonso's character
to wear.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.904
I think this is his favorite.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.275
What do you want?
I've gotta get ready for the show.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.639
No, no.
Say what's up to everybody, man.

06:53.813 --> 06:54.837
- Hello.
- No.

06:55.014 --> 06:58.506
See, I got everybody, I'm taking them
backstage, I'm showing them stuff.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.619
All the hush-hush undercover stuff
they don't really get to see.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.780
We getting prepared for the show.
What do you do to get prepared?

07:04.957 --> 07:08.449
I like to go... I sit in my dressing room.
I take my script, I read it over.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.222
Make sure I got my lines right,
you never wanna mess up.

07:11.397 --> 07:14.161
- It's really...
- Yeah. We only got a half hour, though.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.631
How about you do the Carlton dance
real quick? Do the Carlton dance.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.204
Ha, ha, ha.
How about I don't and say I did?

07:20.907 --> 07:24.900
Man, that dance is your trademark.
So is overacting.

07:30.483 --> 07:33.111
Why? No.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.619
God, why'd you take him?

07:37.323 --> 07:41.020
You. You did this to him.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.455
Oh, no.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.837
Ah!

07:56.375 --> 07:57.842
Ah!

08:00.046 --> 08:01.536
Ah!

08:02.882 --> 08:04.440
Ah!

08:04.717 --> 08:06.912
No! No!

08:07.086 --> 08:10.522
How could you do this? Oh, God! No!

08:10.690 --> 08:13.625
No. No.

08:13.793 --> 08:16.990
Will, no, please! God, no!

08:17.163 --> 08:18.425
Oh, no.

08:19.031 --> 08:22.523
Oh, God. No.

08:22.702 --> 08:26.103
Oh, God. How can he do that?

08:26.272 --> 08:28.001
How can he do that?

08:28.174 --> 08:31.735
Please, no. Oh, my God.

08:31.911 --> 08:35.607
Look, I will not be publicly embarrassed
by, um, um, a problem...

08:35.780 --> 08:38.544
...of me remembering my damn lines.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.150
It won't happen, damn it.

08:40.318 --> 08:42.616
- It ain't gonna happen.
- It's okay. It's okay.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.689
- I'm not gonna allow it, all right?
- It's okay, hey. It's okay.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.122
- It's over.
- It's all right, man. It's all right.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.659
- Let it go, man.
- It's over.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.091
- It's okay, man.
- All right.

08:52.131 --> 08:54.691
I can feel the power.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.792
Yes!

08:59.839 --> 09:02.034
Yes!

09:04.710 --> 09:06.439
Oh, God!

09:12.451 --> 09:15.011
No, no, no.
That's called good show energy.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.087
This is overacting.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.849
I would've expected this from Carlton...

09:21.861 --> 09:23.123
...but not you.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.417
Ashley, no!

10:14.246 --> 10:18.239
Damn, damn, damn, James.

10:18.417 --> 10:19.441
Cut.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.917
<i>That was from Good Times.</i>

10:22.855 --> 10:25.949
Where's my Willy, Carlton?
I can't find my Willy.

10:35.534 --> 10:37.559
<i>CARLTON
This little light of mine</i>

10:38.938 --> 10:40.428
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

10:42.041 --> 10:43.531
<i>This little light of mine</i>

10:47.980 --> 10:52.940
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

10:54.820 --> 10:59.689
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

11:07.199 --> 11:11.295
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

11:24.116 --> 11:26.641
All right, here we are.
This is Makeup and Hair, right?

11:26.819 --> 11:31.222
This is where we get our, uh, um,
makeup and our hair done.

11:31.390 --> 11:35.326
This is Karyn and this is Tatyana. They play
Hilary and Ashley. Say what's up, y'all.

11:35.494 --> 11:36.552
- Hey.
- What's up?

11:36.729 --> 11:38.720
I'm just showing everybody around,
you know.

11:38.898 --> 11:41.594
Showing them
how we get prepared for the show.

11:41.767 --> 11:42.791
Oh, hey, here.

11:42.968 --> 11:44.697
- Let me put some lipstick on you.
- No.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.804
- I'm gonna put a little lip...
- No. Will.

11:46.972 --> 11:50.840
- People are looking. Let me put lipstick...
- Will, stop it. Come on.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.001
Here, let me your hair.
Let me do your hair.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.444
- No. Why don't you go bug Ta? Go ahead.
Don't bug Ta.

11:56.615 --> 11:59.675
- Let me put some lipstick on.
- Will, be careful with that, please.

11:59.852 --> 12:03.845
- I just wanna put some lipstick on you.
- No, Will, that's a really bright color, okay?

12:05.524 --> 12:06.718
Think they tripping now...

12:06.892 --> 12:09.588
...you should see them
when they be messing their lines up.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.354
I'm Hilary Banks. TV Weather Girl.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.658
When I don't have my head in the clouds,
I like to relax with a nice hot cup of...

12:16.268 --> 12:17.292
Hot cup of...

12:17.470 --> 12:18.664
Well, at first, I said...

12:18.838 --> 12:20.066
Ah, shoot. Damn it.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.866
- And then what'd you say?
- I forgot.

12:22.041 --> 12:25.636
The next thing I said,
when I don't have my... Oh, shoot.

12:26.312 --> 12:29.281
- The next thing I said...
- Hilary, how many takes did you do?

12:29.448 --> 12:31.439
Only 41.
You'd think that would tire me out.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.676
But I'm more awake now
than when we started.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.047
What's wrong?

12:35.221 --> 12:36.916
I'm serious, Daddy.

12:37.089 --> 12:41.082
I'm not gonna just sit here and watch you
eat yourself into an early grave.

12:41.260 --> 12:46.197
- Ha, ha. So you're gonna throw a fork at me?
- I tried to keep going.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.093
Do you swear to tell the truth
so help you God?

12:49.268 --> 12:50.735
Ha, ha, ha. I'm sorry.

12:54.173 --> 12:58.701
With an old raggedy halter top
that say, "Yeah, boy."

13:03.115 --> 13:05.015
So sorry.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.750
With an old raggedy halter top
that say, "Heh!"

13:13.626 --> 13:16.652
The camera's on me.
I thought the camera was just on him.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.195
I can't deal with this.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.562
Just for no reason, you'll say,
"Dum-dum-dee-day."

13:28.607 --> 13:32.338
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.480
Geoffrey, guess what.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.481
- Will saw... Heh, heh. I'm sorry.
- Good job. Thank you. Good job.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.051
Oh, yeah, see,
she messed her line up, though.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.017
Hey, Ta, listen, all right?

13:43.189 --> 13:46.317
- Now, I don't play that crap!
No.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.653
No, no! I don't play that! Listen.
- No! No!

13:48.828 --> 13:51.922
I'm not playing with you!
- You had the same...

13:52.097 --> 13:55.032
I have money invested in companies
that I've never even...

13:55.201 --> 13:56.759
- Heard of.
- Heard of.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.803
Ha, ha. Oh, I'm totally... I'm so sorry.

13:59.972 --> 14:02.133
No, no!

14:03.042 --> 14:04.737
Help me.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.374
Oh, no. This is not happening. Ha, ha, ha.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.149
What are you guys doing?

14:18.390 --> 14:19.823
You completely messed me up.

14:19.992 --> 14:23.393
I looked over and you had this vacant look
in your eyes. I remember it.

14:23.562 --> 14:26.258
I wanted to go home.
But don't blame me for you messing up.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.366
- That was the fifth take.
- Me, messing up?

14:28.534 --> 14:29.558
- Excuse me.
- What?

14:29.735 --> 14:33.364
I'm just trying to figure out why
I couldn't put some lipstick on somebody.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.803
What is this thing about lipstick
you got going on?

14:35.975 --> 14:38.273
All right.
We've known each other for six years.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.504
- I should be able to put lipstick on you.
- You got a lipstick thing going on.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.740
- You're disrespecting me.
- We have known each other for six years.

14:44.917 --> 14:48.876
I think it's his turn for lipstick.
He's never gotten any. Have a seat.

14:49.955 --> 14:52.651
- Why y'all getting all strong?
- His eyebrows need plucking.

14:52.825 --> 14:56.261
- Oh, his eyebrows. Yes.
- Don't be tweezing my eyebrows.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.919
Right there.
- Get off me. Get off... No, get off me.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.225
Get off me.
All right. Now, that's enough.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.062
Y'all play too daggone much.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.667
They be playing too much.

15:08.974 --> 15:12.375
Now, come on, let's go somewhere
where we appreciated.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.241
All right, Rusty.
- Hey, Joe. What's up, man?

15:18.417 --> 15:22.114
Hey, Will. Nice shade.

15:22.288 --> 15:25.280
Oh, no, no.
Karyn and Ta, they were just playing. No.

15:25.457 --> 15:28.824
Hey. Oh, everybody. Joe Marcell.
He plays Geoffrey the butler.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.222
- Hello.
- Yeah.

15:30.396 --> 15:33.627
I was just showing them clips of everybody
messing their lines up.

15:33.799 --> 15:36.063
But not you, man. You are refined.

15:36.235 --> 15:39.568
You British. You special, man.
State of the art, boy.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.172
- Thank you, Will.
- Oh, no. I mean, I'm just saying...

15:42.341 --> 15:45.606
...when you step out on that stage, man,
you just get out there and you hit it. Blam!

15:45.778 --> 15:47.143
- Blam.
- That's right.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.282
- Thank you, again, Will.
- Yeah, right.

15:50.449 --> 15:54.146
When she's not looking,
break one of her crystal fusiliers.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.415
I'm hawking candy bars.
They're only 5 bucks.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.456
Marvelous.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.459
Why is it marvelous?

16:05.164 --> 16:08.861
- Well, I'm off for the weekend.
- Where you going, Geoffrey?

16:10.402 --> 16:12.996
- Where am I going?
You don't even know where you going.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.332
I've not a clue.

16:14.873 --> 16:18.104
And you are left alone
standing in the dark.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.278
They've started their women's weekend...

16:23.449 --> 16:26.748
...of nothing but facials,
massages and...

16:30.055 --> 16:34.048
I guess all that British stuff
went right out the window, huh? Ha, ha.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.753
I'm an actor, not a machine.

16:40.432 --> 16:44.163
Yeah, whatever.
Just lose the phony accent.

16:44.703 --> 16:45.795
Well... Ooh!

16:45.971 --> 16:49.463
If I had a watch on, I'd know I was late.
I gotta go get my face right.

16:49.641 --> 16:51.836
I gotta get my wardrobe
and everything together.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.310
For the past six years, we always
come together right before the show.

16:55.481 --> 16:58.075
So y'all stay tuned
because it's showtime.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.347
<i>Ho! Ho! Ho!</i>

17:03.188 --> 17:06.453
<i>How y'all feeling, fool?
Hey, how y'all feeling?</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:15.262
<i>Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it</i>

17:19.104 --> 17:23.063
<i>Kemosabe, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it</i>

17:27.746 --> 17:31.682
<i>Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it</i>

17:36.021 --> 17:39.184
<i>Apache, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it</i>

17:42.094 --> 17:44.460
<i>A- hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga</i>

17:45.931 --> 17:47.023
I just have to say...

17:47.199 --> 17:51.226
...there's not another group of people I
would rather be in this kind of circle with...

17:51.403 --> 17:53.894
...a hundred and forty-nine
some-odd times.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.338
Hey.
Yeah.

17:57.509 --> 17:59.136
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:59.311 --> 18:00.972
Ditto.
Oh, ditto.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.546
Even though James
takes up most of the circle...

18:04.216 --> 18:05.774
As well I should.

18:07.286 --> 18:11.120
Oh, let's go out there
and let's just have some fun. Give me some!

18:16.695 --> 18:17.753
Have a good show.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.454
You ready, baby? You ready?
- Yes.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.566
Are you ready?
Come on, let's get this party, right?

18:23.335 --> 18:24.461
Ugh!

18:25.003 --> 18:27.767
I'm sorry, man.
You all...? Are you all right?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.407
Okay. You're gonna be all right?

18:29.575 --> 18:32.169
All right, come on, come on.
You can... No.

18:32.344 --> 18:34.403
Here we go.
Come on, let's go.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.604
Let's go!

18:35.781 --> 18:39.512
All right, guys, make some noise.
It's showtime, baby. It's showtime.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.047
Whoo!

18:44.223 --> 18:47.818
All right, all right, all right.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.894
Here he is, Joseph Marcell.

18:58.337 --> 19:02.671
How about a hand?
Playing Ashley, Miss Tatyana M. Ali.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.206
Miss Tatyana M. Ali.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.009
Here she is. There she is.

19:09.581 --> 19:13.073
Alfonso Ribeiro. There he is.

19:13.719 --> 19:14.947
Baby.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.182
Miss Karyn Parsons.

19:20.359 --> 19:25.023
Miss Karyn Parsons. Hilary.

19:25.197 --> 19:30.965
Miss Daphne Maxwell Reid. Vivian.

19:31.603 --> 19:35.903
James Avery. Uncle Phil.

19:36.074 --> 19:38.235
Yeah, lose your mind, guys.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.243
Lose your mind. Lose your mind.

19:42.881 --> 19:46.840
Here we go, guys. MTV Music Award,
Grammy, Soul Train Music...

19:47.019 --> 19:50.455
<i>...the movie Bad Boys and, of course,
guys, catch him in Independence Day.</i>

19:50.622 --> 19:53.284
How about a hand? Mr. Will "Will" Smith!

19:58.630 --> 19:59.654
Mr. Will Smith.

19:59.831 --> 20:02.026
Get up, y'all. Get up, y'all.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.828
Get up! Get up! Get up!

20:04.002 --> 20:06.163
Let me hear you say "yeah."

20:06.338 --> 20:07.362
Yeah.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.030
Now everybody scream.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.779
Oh, yeah. Mix Master Mike,
throw something on.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.711
I want y'all to have fun.
I'm gonna get ready.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.908
I'll see y'all in about two minutes.
Peace.

20:20.085 --> 20:23.213
Yo, now, that was a funny show.
I enjoyed seeing them guys mess up.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.912
And trust me, they mess up a lot.

20:25.090 --> 20:28.059
But, Will,
we didn't get to see your bloopers.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.457
Uh... Pssh.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.893
- We out of time, though, man.
- Wait.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.660
No, no, no. Wait.
Will, we got lots of time.

20:36.835 --> 20:37.893
Trust me. Roll them.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.827
Now I'm a happy chicken.

20:40.005 --> 20:43.497
Will, where are you going?
We haven't finished shooting the...

20:48.580 --> 20:50.377
<i>H- G, helium
L- I, lithium</i>

20:50.549 --> 20:51.573
<i>Z- M...</i>

20:51.750 --> 20:52.774
Wrong line.

20:52.951 --> 20:55.010
Hey, look. Hey, look, man.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.417
Check it out. Check it out, man.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.685
If anybody know my line
just tell me what it is, right? Heh, heh, heh.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.588
Is this where the party is?

21:09.901 --> 21:13.302
Granny, I really like you.
I mean, you and Grandpa... Grand... Um...

21:13.472 --> 21:15.565
That dude that you married.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.739
I mean, she's Ionely and something...

21:18.910 --> 21:22.107
I don't remember my lines.
I was gonna babble through that joint now.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.575
I just wanna say that I greatly admire your...

21:26.952 --> 21:28.146
Excuse you.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.551
Oh, God. Thank you.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.355
Thank you so much.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.222
How'd you like the bloopers?

21:43.502 --> 21:47.268
Didn't really work for me, you know.
I didn't think it was too funny.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.599
Don't you gotta go see Ed McMahon
or something?

21:49.775 --> 21:52.266
No, no. Look at this one.
I got a real beauty.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.572
I'm sorry, Dick.
I'll see you later, all right? Thanks a lot.
