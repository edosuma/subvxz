00:08.273 --> 00:09.909
There's your chips.

00:10.377 --> 00:11.711
I made you some dip.

00:11.744 --> 00:13.712
- Darling, what would I do

00:11.744 --> 00:13.712
without you?

00:13.746 --> 00:16.115
- I don't know.

00:13.746 --> 00:16.115
And I'm gonna eat cantaloupe.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.510
- I hate that for you.

00:18.839 --> 00:20.353
- Says the guy eating chips

00:18.839 --> 00:20.353
for breakfast.

00:20.387 --> 00:22.187
- Good morning.

- Isn't she cute?

00:27.926 --> 00:29.963
- I love this.

00:29.995 --> 00:32.899
- Nana said I can be whatever

00:29.995 --> 00:32.899
I wanna be, so I'm a princess.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.634
- Yeah, but you can be whatever

00:32.932 --> 00:34.634
you wanna be on days

00:34.667 --> 00:35.868

00:35.902 --> 00:37.299
- Tell him my name.

00:37.369 --> 00:40.606
- Her name is

00:37.369 --> 00:40.606
Cinderella the Fabled.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.420
- I don't understand

00:40.640 --> 00:42.420
what you're doing.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.512
Let me have this.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.512
"What's your princess name?"

00:45.545 --> 00:48.881
So you basically take

00:45.545 --> 00:48.881
the first letter of your name.

00:48.914 --> 00:50.482
So I would be Tiana.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.953
And then my birthday--

00:50.517 --> 00:53.953
the month is April.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.890
Tiana Windwalker. Absolutely.

00:56.923 --> 00:58.692
I work in Vegas with that name.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.619
- Shut... [laughs]

00:58.725 --> 01:02.619
What would mine be?

01:02.950 --> 01:05.799
- You would be Jas...

01:05.831 --> 01:07.200
- And then January.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.569
- You would be Jasmine Star.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.670
- Jasmine Star.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.640
- Name up in lights.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.207
- Yeah, the Red Light District.

01:16.909 --> 01:18.311
- Dad, so can I wear

01:16.909 --> 01:18.311
this to school?

01:18.344 --> 01:20.546
- No. Mama, you cannot

01:18.344 --> 01:20.546
be sending her

01:20.579 --> 01:21.748
out of here in costume.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.829
- She is a princess.

01:23.829 --> 01:26.859
So she can go to school

01:23.829 --> 01:26.859
however she wants to.

01:26.118 --> 01:27.387
- Absolutely not.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.908
- I mean, can you go back

06:13.673 --> 06:15.908

06:15.942 --> 06:18.444
- No, I can't

06:15.942 --> 06:18.444
because we've agreed to it.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.480
- So we're gonna have to go

06:18.478 --> 06:21.480
to your mom's.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.500
- Listen,

06:21.514 --> 06:24.500
Nanny's is not an option.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.351
It's too small.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.286
He's not gonna like it there.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.286
- No.

06:27.319 --> 06:29.288
- Nanny's not gonna like

06:27.319 --> 06:29.288
y'all being there.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.689
- Agreed.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.257
- You just need to suck it up

06:30.723 --> 06:32.257
and talk to your mom.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.593
- Well, I can

06:32.292 --> 06:33.593
tell you right now,

06:33.625 --> 06:35.694
one thing that

06:33.625 --> 06:35.694
I would love to see

06:35.728 --> 06:38.197

06:45.170 --> 06:46.720

06:46.805 --> 06:48.307

06:48.341 --> 06:49.808
to be able to come out

06:48.341 --> 06:49.808
to brunch

06:49.843 --> 06:51.411
with my two favorite children.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.411
- Daddy, stop with the crap.

06:51.444 --> 06:52.678
If Chase was sitting here,

06:52.711 --> 06:54.680
you'd be saying

06:52.711 --> 06:54.680
the exact same thing to him.

06:54.713 --> 06:57.449
- I have my favorites.

06:54.713 --> 06:57.449
It's whoever's closest.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.817
- Exactly.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.209
- Speaking of that,

06:58.851 --> 07:01.209
what's going on in your life?

07:01.209 --> 07:03.230
- Well, I was invited

07:01.209 --> 07:03.230
to a party.

07:03.230 --> 07:06.589
- A party?

07:03.230 --> 07:06.589
- We love a good party.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.427
- Savannah.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.427
- I'm just saying.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.730
- Well, I was thinking about

07:08.461 --> 07:10.730
having my own party.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.565
- Okay, that's a good idea.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.565
You can have it at the house.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.699
- I was thinking pool party

07:13.600 --> 07:17.699
at Savannah's house.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.372
- Why would you wanna have it

07:17.103 --> 07:19.372
at Savannah's?

07:19.406 --> 07:20.906
- Dad, she's more fun.

07:20.939 --> 07:22.242
You're, like,

07:20.939 --> 07:22.242
an older demographic.

07:22.274 --> 07:23.343
- Yeah.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.177
- Demogra--

07:23.375 --> 07:25.177
I am the demographic.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.961
Good for you.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.196
But you know what, Gray?

07:43.228 --> 07:44.764
You can have the party

07:43.228 --> 07:44.764

07:44.798 --> 07:46.800
Just make sure

07:44.798 --> 07:46.800
nobody drowns, please.

07:46.832 --> 07:48.634
- Well, if we're having

07:46.832 --> 07:48.634
the party at your house,

07:48.668 --> 07:50.336
are you gonna be there

07:48.668 --> 07:50.336
to chaperone?

07:50.370 --> 07:52.872
- Well, I mean,

07:50.370 --> 07:52.872
I wasn't really planning on it,

07:52.906 --> 07:55.750
but I'm down to chaperone.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.509

what I did today?

08:08.588 --> 08:10.923
- What, darling?

08:08.588 --> 08:10.923
- I worked out at 6:00 a.m.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.826
- You know what I did?

08:11.240 --> 08:12.826
- What?

08:12.858 --> 08:15.928
- I got up,

08:12.858 --> 08:15.928
had a chicken biscuit.

08:16.290 --> 08:19.665
But I put a bunch of mayonnaise

08:16.290 --> 08:19.665
on one side of it.

08:19.699 --> 08:22.101
Then I had a little honey

08:19.699 --> 08:22.101
on the other side.

Nanny, you know

08:24.571 --> 08:26.740
what I cannot believe?

08:26.773 --> 08:28.410
- What?

08:28.410 --> 08:30.276
- That Mom and Dad

08:28.410 --> 08:30.276
are selling their house,

08:30.310 --> 08:32.450
and they just got moved in.

that they found someplace

08:34.470 --> 08:35.715

08:35.749 --> 08:37.850

08:35.749 --> 08:37.850
- No.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.220
- Well, I heard

08:37.884 --> 08:40.220
that the plan was

08:40.253 --> 08:42.187
for them to move in with you.

08:42.221 --> 08:46.590

08:42.221 --> 08:46.590
I love having my family around.

- Yeah, Nanny,

08:46.919 --> 08:47.927
but you gotta think about this.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.229
You're gonna be living

08:47.961 --> 08:49.229
with dad.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.798
- Well, maybe he'll be

08:49.261 --> 08:51.798
better this time.

If he don't,

08:53.365 --> 08:54.967
I'm gonna treat him

- Nanny!

09:02.775 --> 09:04.443

- Where do you want me

09:04.476 --> 09:06.513
to put your recliner?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.581
- To the curb!

in here on my rug.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.687

that if he moves in,

09:16.389 --> 09:18.224
your freedom is gone.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.860

I can't kick him out.

you're not a parent.

12:22.841 --> 12:25.311
since you're moving in here,

12:25.345 --> 12:28.248
it's time to embrace Miley.

- No,

13:11.490 --> 13:14.126
that is definitely not it.

13:14.159 --> 13:15.729

Why do you have

13:21.201 --> 13:23.336
these cheap-ass hangers?

13:23.370 --> 13:26.538
- Those are from the laundry,

13:23.370 --> 13:26.538

13:26.572 --> 13:29.808
- All right, so clearly,

13:35.548 --> 13:37.584
then we'll give him something

13:41.988 --> 13:45.658
I have so much more clothes

13:45.692 --> 13:46.993
I've gotta bring over,

13:47.929 --> 13:49.294

18:09.549 --> 18:11.191
and all he wants to do

18:09.549 --> 18:11.191
is bitch, bitch, bitch.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.660
- So we got something

18:11.223 --> 18:13.660
for him to bitch about.

18:13.692 --> 18:15.950
- I told Mama our plan,

18:15.127 --> 18:16.930
and she's bringing him

18:15.127 --> 18:16.930
here now.

18:17.299 --> 18:18.565
And I'm gonna put some lemonade

18:17.299 --> 18:18.565
right here,

18:18.597 --> 18:20.299
so it looks like they peed.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.169
- Oh, Lord, he'll crack up now,

18:20.333 --> 18:23.169
sure enough.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.837
<i>* *</i>

18:24.871 --> 18:27.173
- What the hell?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.608
- Come here. [whistles]

18:27.207 --> 18:29.608
C'mon, c'mon, dogs.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.876
[whistles]

18:30.910 --> 18:32.778
- What the hell are

18:30.910 --> 18:32.778
y'all do--God almighty!

18:32.811 --> 18:34.948
There's another one.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.948
- Hey.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.782
- What the hell are

18:35.480 --> 18:36.782
y'all doing?

18:36.816 --> 18:38.852
- Todd,

18:36.816 --> 18:38.852
it's our new business.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.539
Doggy Faye-care.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.539
Don't that have a good ring?

18:41.869 --> 18:43.189
- Doggy Faye-care?

18:41.869 --> 18:43.189
- Yeah.

18:43.222 --> 18:44.624
- [barks]

18:43.222 --> 18:44.624
- [screams]

18:44.656 --> 18:45.959
- I'm about

18:44.656 --> 18:45.959
to start bath time.

18:46.589 --> 18:49.194
So I'm used to washing Lilo.

18:46.589 --> 18:49.194
I can do that by myself.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.896
But I'ma need some help

18:49.229 --> 18:50.896
with the anal glands.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.164
So that's where you come in.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.700
- With the what?

18:53.732 --> 18:55.201
See, this is exactly

18:53.732 --> 18:55.201
why I didn't want

18:55.234 --> 18:56.403
to move in with my mama--

18:56.435 --> 18:58.371
because she's always

18:56.435 --> 18:58.371
doing crazy [bleep].

18:58.404 --> 19:00.573
- I know, Todd, but your mom

18:58.404 --> 19:00.573
opened her home to us.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.799
So you know what?

19:02.799 --> 19:03.742
You just need to suck it up

19:02.799 --> 19:03.742
and be a little gracious.

19:03.777 --> 19:05.109
- I'm afraid to suck it up

19:05.450 --> 19:06.913
for fear of choking

19:05.450 --> 19:06.913
on a hair ball.

19:07.130 --> 19:08.515
Mama, why didn't you tell me

19:08.548 --> 19:10.482
about this when you knew that

19:08.548 --> 19:10.482
I was gonna be staying here?

19:10.517 --> 19:11.817
- This is my house.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.753
I didn't know that

19:11.851 --> 19:14.753
I needed permission from you.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.556
- When do these mutts leave?

19:16.588 --> 19:19.659
- From 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.,

19:16.588 --> 19:19.659
they're my dogs.

19:19.692 --> 19:23.462
- Mama, 8:00 to 5:00, my ass.

19:19.692 --> 19:23.462
- Okay, okay.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.397
- Okay, I think we got him.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.267
- And the devil sure

19:25.432 --> 19:27.267
got his dues.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.400
<i>* *</i>

19:34.507 --> 19:35.775
<i>- You gonna play or not?</i>

19:35.808 --> 19:37.430
- Mama, don't be sitting here

19:35.808 --> 19:37.430
teaching my son

19:37.769 --> 19:38.345
how to play poker.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.747
- Listen, I'm starting him off

19:38.377 --> 19:40.747
at an early age

19:40.779 --> 19:42.582
'cause I want him

19:40.779 --> 19:42.582
to learn right.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.484
- Yeah, well,

19:42.615 --> 19:45.484
I'd prefer you do not do that.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.721
But I'm going to bed

19:45.518 --> 19:47.721
because I'm exhausted.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.588
Good night, child.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.588
I love you.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.590
- Go and sleep well.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.589
- Sleep well.

19:53.930 --> 19:54.599
Wait for it.

19:54.940 --> 19:56.895
Wait for it.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.765
<i>- [screams]</i>

19:58.798 --> 20:01.339
- There it is.

20:01.670 --> 20:03.435
- Mama, what the hell

20:01.670 --> 20:03.435
is this in my bed?

20:03.470 --> 20:06.138
- I guess the dog

20:03.470 --> 20:06.138
just took it on in there.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.942
- On my bed?

20:08.974 --> 20:12.912
- The whole doggy daycare thing

20:08.974 --> 20:12.912
was just a prank, Todd.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.809
- Golf clap, golf clap.

20:15.115 --> 20:16.782
- So you don't actually

20:15.115 --> 20:16.782
have a dog business?

20:16.816 --> 20:18.117
- No, Todd.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.452
I just did that to aggravate

20:18.151 --> 20:20.452
the hell out of you.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.123
- [laughing]

20:23.155 --> 20:25.191
You've been bitching ever

20:23.155 --> 20:25.191
since you come in the door,

20:25.224 --> 20:26.692
and I just wanted

20:25.224 --> 20:26.692
to teach you a lesson.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.127
- Honey, you know I love you

20:28.161 --> 20:29.229
with my heart and soul.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.529
I really do.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.365
But you're not the easiest

20:30.563 --> 20:32.365
person to live with.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.335
- I appreciate that, Mama.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.836
And I don't want

20:35.367 --> 20:36.836
to be disrespectful.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.570
So I apologize.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.373
- I accept your apology.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.775
- Well, thank you.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.910
- I think everyone has learned

20:43.942 --> 20:45.511
a little something

20:43.942 --> 20:45.511
about respect.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.815
I think for Grayson,

20:45.545 --> 20:48.815
it was to respect all women.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.650
And for you, my dear...

20:50.683 --> 20:54.354
- I have learned that I may

20:50.683 --> 20:54.354
have been overzealous

20:54.386 --> 20:57.356
in my approach towards

20:54.386 --> 20:57.356
moving in with my mother.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.825
So Nanny Faye,

20:58.857 --> 21:02.595
from the bottom of my heart,

20:58.857 --> 21:02.595
I apologize for my rudeness.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.230
- [chuckles]

21:04.263 --> 21:07.834
- And, Todd, you know

21:04.263 --> 21:07.834
that I love to see y'all come.

21:07.866 --> 21:10.936
But it's my home;

21:07.866 --> 21:10.936
it's my rules.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.404
- Don't you worry, Faye.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.708
Todd's gonna be

21:12.439 --> 21:14.708
on his best behavior. Right?

21:14.740 --> 21:18.779
- As long as those mangy,

21:14.740 --> 21:18.779
scraggly, smelly-ass dogs

21:18.779 --> 21:20.779
are not here, I can

21:18.779 --> 21:20.779
put forth more of an effort.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.248
- So what you're saying is that

21:22.281 --> 21:24.451
if they were here,

21:22.281 --> 21:24.451
you'd be in a hotel?

21:24.483 --> 21:25.984
- 100%.

21:26.859 --> 21:27.753
- We gotta get the dogs back.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.522
- I don't know which is worse,

21:27.787 --> 21:30.522
the dogs or him.

21:30.557 --> 21:30.890
- [laughs]
