00:25.358 --> 00:28.903
Dissertation notes... 207,

00:28.987 --> 00:31.030
on indigenous masks.

00:31.114 --> 00:35.910
First of I'm thinking
probably at least three visits

00:35.994 --> 00:38.705
to this particular exhibit.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.499
Uh, following the suggestion
by Professor K

00:41.583 --> 00:43.585
to separate out
the different aspects

00:43.668 --> 00:45.003
to better
recombine them later.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.088
I'll be limiting
my observations this time

00:47.172 --> 00:48.965
to the experiential angle
of the masks,

00:49.048 --> 00:52.761
and focus instead on
the masks as objects,

00:52.844 --> 00:56.139
or art, or art objects.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.017
The larger question obviously
being the role

00:59.100 --> 01:00.852
of the experiential
in the overall function

01:00.935 --> 01:01.895
of the masks.

01:01.978 --> 01:06.107
Not just ceremonial,
but expressive, et cetera.

01:08.568 --> 01:12.781
Maybe, honestly, even just
how it makes you feel.

01:12.864 --> 01:16.826
You could stand to let yourself
feel some things again, Claudia.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.454
And, of course,
there's the question of

01:19.537 --> 01:21.998
immortality, infinite lives.

01:22.081 --> 01:25.835
But for now, I'm going to try
not to think in those terms

01:25.919 --> 01:27.629
because of the deliberate
experimental

01:27.712 --> 01:30.381
compartmentalization.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.343
Maybe find a better way
to articulate that concept.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.469
Sidenote.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.387
And then...
(sighs)

01:36.471 --> 01:39.682
...just keep
writing essays forever.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.478
That way you don't have to,
what's the word?

01:43.561 --> 01:46.689
Live. Be a person.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.317
Perfect.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.695
So... masks.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.032
-(gasps)
-Sorry.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.245
Sorry. Are you okay?

02:00.328 --> 02:01.913
(chuckles)

02:01.996 --> 02:04.332
You saved my life.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.668
I'm sure you would have
been fine.

02:06.751 --> 02:10.505
It's not... that big a truck.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.385
Okay. Still glad I didn't
get run over by it.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.763
Well, I mean, to each his own.
Or her own.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.098
Right?

02:22.016 --> 02:23.393
Well, thank you.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.562
Today was almost a very bad day.

02:25.645 --> 02:29.023
A day is what you make it.
Right?

02:33.278 --> 02:36.030
Sidenote: almost died.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.201
And met future husband.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.790
Dum-dum.

<i>MAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i>Attention, visitors...</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:50.003
(indistinct chatter)

02:51.713 --> 02:54.757
Oh, and, uh, one more for
Evel Knievel here.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.259
What? No.
No, no, no, no, no.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.261
-It's too late.
-I can't let you buy my ticket.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.639
Unfortunately, the transaction's
already complete.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.766
If you reverse it now...

03:03.850 --> 03:06.603
technically,
you'd be robbing the museum.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.272
You'd rob a museum?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.733
My God, you're a monster.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.613
-(chuckles)
-Enjoy your visit.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.448
Thank you.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.533
<i>CLAUDIA:</i>
<i>The display part interferes</i>

03:20.617 --> 03:23.077
in a way since, of course,
this is far from

03:23.161 --> 03:26.623
the mask's original context.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.583
Is that something
to take into account

03:28.666 --> 03:32.587
or specifically <i> not</i>
take into account?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.632
Possibly already
being too dogmatic

03:35.715 --> 03:37.425
about this
compartmentalization thing.

03:37.508 --> 03:41.429
Are they terrifying,
or are they funny?

03:41.512 --> 03:44.140
And how much of both
of those reactions is

03:44.223 --> 03:47.477
internalized cultural bias?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.978
-Are you writing a book?
-Jesus!

03:49.062 --> 03:51.272
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sor-- I did it again.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.150
No, no. Thank God for you
sneaking up behind me.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.986
Okay. I think
that's a good thing, or...

03:57.070 --> 03:58.154
Sorry, not sneaking.

03:58.237 --> 04:01.824
Just for the record,
I'm not sure that I...<i> snuck.</i>

04:01.908 --> 04:03.660
Um, I-I don't--
I don't think I said thank you.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.994
I'm pretty sure you did.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.456
-Did I?
-Yeah.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.000
It's so embarrassing,
walking in front of a truck.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.795
And talking into
my dumb phone, too.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.463
I must have looked like
a pretentious idiot.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.382
No, no, you looked like
a very smart...

04:18.466 --> 04:20.843
pretentious person.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.762
I mean, who am I to judge?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.811
Hey, look, I probably look
like I'm showing off, right?

04:29.894 --> 04:33.356
Carrying around, like,
half a tree here.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.191
But honestly,
I love this book so much,

04:35.274 --> 04:36.526
I don't care what anyone thinks.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.529
This author's amazing.
He's got this...

04:39.612 --> 04:42.365
really unique ability
to make the reader feel like

04:42.448 --> 04:44.659
there's no line between
the rational mind

04:44.742 --> 04:47.870
and the most profound depths
of the heart.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.582
And now I'm doing it.
Look at, you got me doing it.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.042
I'm-I'm out-pretentiousing you.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.044
Yeah, yeah, a hundred percent.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.088
Look, it's just fiction, right?

04:57.171 --> 05:00.341
It's no higher or lower

05:00.425 --> 05:02.510
than any other form
of entertainment.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.722
I mean, people used to think
that the novel was trash.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.058
Yeah, they used to say,
"That's not literature."

05:09.142 --> 05:11.519
Were they wrong,
or are we wrong?

05:11.602 --> 05:13.938
Or is nobody wrong?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.273
Actually...
(laughs)

05:15.356 --> 05:16.733
What?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.568
There's a-- there's a really
great quote about that

05:18.651 --> 05:21.237
in this book, um...

05:21.320 --> 05:25.074
"What is wrong in the end
which never comes, or..."

05:25.158 --> 05:28.077
There's a-a line break.

05:28.161 --> 05:33.249
"...which comes again and again,
lap-lap-lapping, like waves?"

05:33.332 --> 05:34.625
Wow.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.838
You memorized that, huh?
You're a memorizer?

05:38.921 --> 05:40.673
Yeah.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.884
Hmm, good to know.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.261
Starting to form a picture here.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.388
(chuckles)

05:50.516 --> 05:53.436
Well, since you loved
that one so much,

05:53.519 --> 05:54.771
you want to hear another?

05:54.854 --> 05:57.231
I don't.
Specifically not.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.941
Nobody usually lets me
get through one quote,

05:59.025 --> 06:00.485
so I thought I might kind of
press my luck.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.444
Okay, yeah. Go ahead.

06:01.527 --> 06:05.281
Okay, "Absurdity is
the too-true truth.

06:05.364 --> 06:09.327
A truth so true,
we put it in quarantine."

06:09.410 --> 06:10.953
Hold on. Wait a minute.
Yanofsky?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.498
What? Oh, Yanofsky?

06:13.581 --> 06:15.458
Oh, no. What did he do?
Did he--

06:15.541 --> 06:17.794
Is he canceled? You know what,
I don't like him anymore.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.337
Retroactively,
I never liked him.

06:19.420 --> 06:23.299
No, he's not canceled.
It's just so random for you.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.635
I specifically love that quote.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.638
That specific part of the
speech, the speech he gave...

06:28.721 --> 06:30.681
At the Nobel.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.642
Yeah.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.564
"Because at root, we do know
life's value lies

06:38.648 --> 06:40.691
not in its length
or its depths..."

06:40.775 --> 06:44.487
Ooh, a fellow memorizer.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.990
It is just so weird that
that's the quote

06:48.074 --> 06:49.283
you pulled out of the air.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.494
Exactly that quote.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.872
You know, you've got this
really interesting, um...

06:54.956 --> 06:55.915
energy.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.291
-You know?
-Yeah?

06:57.375 --> 07:00.503
Yeah, it's like you're
one day old

07:00.586 --> 07:02.630
and a thousand years old
at the same time.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.548
I don't know.

07:03.631 --> 07:08.427
You, you. You're blowing
my mind right now.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.891
It's funny you should
say that, though.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.477
Um, my dissertation's about--

07:16.561 --> 07:19.522
That-That's why I'm dictating.
I'm writing a dissertation.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.315
Oh, okay, got it.
Indigenous masks?

07:21.399 --> 07:24.694
Yeah. Specifically,
questions of reincarnation.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.946
New lives, old lives.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.993
And what is it about
those ideas that interests you?

07:32.076 --> 07:34.078
I mean, I only ask because
it feels like

07:34.162 --> 07:36.873
it means more to you
than just something you study.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.585
Well, I'm studying it
because I like it.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.879
But...

07:45.923 --> 07:48.676
Mm, lately
I've been feeling like...

07:51.304 --> 07:53.764
You know when you,
you've been really sick,

07:53.848 --> 07:55.016
and then you feel better,

07:55.099 --> 07:57.602
and you look at the sky?

07:57.685 --> 08:01.480
You know, like, the clouds
in the sky, or birds in the sky.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.193
And you get this feeling like...

08:05.276 --> 08:07.069
Like a new beginning?

08:08.029 --> 08:09.530
(laughs softly)

08:09.614 --> 08:12.033
That's exactly what
I was going to say.

08:12.116 --> 08:16.287
(laughs):
I know the feeling well.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.622
Check this out.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.418
(children shouting, laughing)

08:22.501 --> 08:25.087
Masks.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.257
Maybe this could help
with your dissertation.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.929
This guy's name is Bob Johnson.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.764
-Do you know Bob Johnson?
-No.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.432
"Hi, I'm Dan Thompson."

08:36.515 --> 08:37.808
(laughs):
So stupid.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.727
{\an5}-I want you to meet a close,
personal friend of mine.
-(watch beeps)

08:40.811 --> 08:43.940
This is Karl-Sly
Richterfurchten.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.943
-Hang on.
-(chuckles)

08:47.026 --> 08:47.902
-You almost hit the lady.
-No, I didn't.

08:47.985 --> 08:48.903
-You're gonna be in trouble.
-MOM: Boys!

08:48.986 --> 08:51.489
-What do you think you're doing?
-He started it.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.116
{\an5}-He said I couldn't...
-I do not care what anybody
said about anything.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.493
You do not throw things.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.371
What have I told you
about horseplay?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.461
You might say that Claudia King
has found herself

09:05.544 --> 09:07.296
on a kind of blind date.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.092
One set up not by friend,
family or coworker.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.637
This is a match neither
made in Heaven nor the Internet,

09:14.720 --> 09:18.766
but in the far darker web
of The Twilight Zone.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.978
<i>(The Twilight Zone</i> theme
playing)

09:22.061 --> 09:24.146
NARRATOR: <i> You're traveling</i>

09:24.230 --> 09:27.650

{\an8}Don't you love this place?

09:54.927 --> 09:57.138
{\an8}Only problem is, it makes me
miss New York, you know?

09:57.221 --> 09:59.056
{\an8}-The Museum of Natural History.
-Oh, man,

09:59.140 --> 10:02.018
{\an8}that museum was so important
to me growing up.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.185
{\an8}Wait, are you from New York?

10:03.269 --> 10:07.732
{\an8}No, but in my head it was like
we went in every weekend.

10:07.815 --> 10:11.736
{\an8}The squid and the whale.
The dinosaur bones.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.529
{\an8}Planetarium.

10:13.612 --> 10:16.073
{\an8}Yeah, but for some weird reason,
my favorite thing was

10:16.157 --> 10:19.368
{\an8}that giant cross section
of dirt.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.204
{\an8}Remember? It had, like,
a little earthworm in it.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.082
{\an8}Oh, my God, that-that dirt
was my favorite

10:25.166 --> 10:26.542
{\an8}when I was a little girl.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.045
{\an8}No shit?
Are you messing with me?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.797
{\an8}No. It was.
(laughs)

10:33.341 --> 10:34.884
{\an8}How do you still surprise me?

10:34.967 --> 10:37.345
{\an8}-Huh?
-Uh, sorry. I interrupted you.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.679
{\an8}You were saying something about,

10:38.763 --> 10:40.723
{\an8}um, masks and infinite lives,
and...

10:40.806 --> 10:44.143
{\an8}Did you? Oh, um, I don't know.

10:44.226 --> 10:48.105
{\an8}I mean, I could go on for hours
about it, but, um...

10:48.189 --> 10:50.066
{\an8}Wait, hold on.
I don't even know your name.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.359
{\an8}What-What's your name?

10:51.442 --> 10:53.569
{\an8}It's Marc. With a C.

10:53.652 --> 10:55.738
{\an8}(stifled laugh)
I'm sorry...

10:55.821 --> 10:57.615
{\an8}Wow. Okay.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.493
{\an8}I wasn't ready for this level
of unmodulated ridicule.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.245
{\an8}No, I'm sorry, it's just, um...

11:03.329 --> 11:07.917
{\an8}(laughs) I-I had a crush
on a boy named Marc

11:08.000 --> 11:10.461
{\an8}in the seventh grade,
spelled with a C.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.922
{\an8}-Okay.
-Nothing ever happened.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.299
{\an8}He-he didn't go to my school.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.260
{\an8}I don't even think
we ever even met.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.430
{\an8}But, um, I have this very vivid
memory of telling my girlfriends

11:21.514 --> 11:25.935
{\an8}that I thought the C was sexy.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.104
{\an8}-Wow.
-Yeah. Um...

11:28.187 --> 11:30.439
{\an8}And I can still hear them
laughing at me.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.234
{\an8}-Oh.
-It was so brutal.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.236
{\an8}-That is brutal.
-(chuckles)

11:35.319 --> 11:37.029
{\an8}I love that story.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.614
{\an8}It's one of those things
where you look back

11:38.697 --> 11:40.950
{\an8}and it's so embarrassing,

11:41.033 --> 11:43.119
{\an8}but you also sort of love
yourself for it?

11:43.202 --> 11:45.579
{\an8}-Right?
-(laughs)

11:45.663 --> 11:47.957
{\an8}Like, you finally
have compassion

11:48.040 --> 11:53.462
{\an8}for that younger, innocent moron
you used to be.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.757
{\an8}We don't let ourselves feel
that way too often, do we?

11:56.841 --> 12:00.344
{\an8}I mean, you know,
compassionate for ourselves.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.346
{\an8}But it's nice when it happens,

12:02.430 --> 12:05.766
{\an8}when we slip through
our own defenses.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.162
{\an8}-My name's Claudia.
-Right.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.496
{\an8}-(watch beeping)
-Right-- Yeah, no. Right on.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.664
{\an8}Uh, do you want some gum?

12:28.747 --> 12:30.666
{\an8}Why? Do I need gum?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.502
{\an8}No. Just thought that...
you might like some.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.256
{\an8}No?

12:42.678 --> 12:45.431
{\an8}-Speaking of the Museum
of Natural History...
-Wait, how did you--?

12:45.514 --> 12:48.642
{\an8}I used to fantasize about
getting in that giant canoe

12:48.726 --> 12:50.811
{\an8}at the Museum
of Natural History.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.814
{\an8}Uh, me-me, too.

12:53.898 --> 12:57.693
{\an8}Very specifically, that was a
major childhood fantasy of mine.

12:57.776 --> 12:58.986
No way.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.988
-(chuckles)
-Ah, well, then,

13:01.071 --> 13:02.448
we got to do it.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.574
Do what?

13:03.657 --> 13:05.201
Well, get in the canoe.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.036
Yeah, I wish.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.872
Your wish, my command,
and so forth.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.832
-Wait...
-Oh.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.209
-Oh, oh. Oh, oh.
-Marc.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.086
Marc, don't. Dude.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.546
It's not real, it's a replica.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.006
I know it's a replica.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.716
I'd stop you
if it wasn't a replica.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.886
But the guard is right there.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.888
She's not looking.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.723
She could turn around
at any second.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.559
Yeah, but I don't think
she's going to.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.938
Look, if we stay reasonably
quiet and she looks over here

13:34.021 --> 13:35.731
even once in the next
five minutes,

13:35.814 --> 13:38.943
I will personally give you
a thousand dollars. Okay?

13:39.026 --> 13:42.363
-(sputters) Oh, my... Marc.
-Oh. Oh, oh...

13:45.449 --> 13:46.742
Come on.

13:46.825 --> 13:50.454
You only live
however many times, right?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.623
Come on.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.298
{\an8}What are you doing? Get down.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.384
{\an8}-I'm telling you,
she's not gonna look.
-Get down.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.053
CLAUDIA (whispers):
You're crazy.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.888
{\an8}-This...
-You got to get
outside your head.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.390
{\an8}Live a little.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.559
Ahoy, matey.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.311
We are in the canoe,
ship to shore...

14:14.395 --> 14:16.772
(both laugh)

14:16.855 --> 14:18.190
-All right...
-(shushes)

14:18.274 --> 14:20.276
(whispers):
I want my thousand dollars.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.443
Well, if you want
your thousand dollars,

14:21.527 --> 14:22.778
what are you doing down here?

14:22.861 --> 14:25.739
You should be up there
testing it.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.788
I really did dream of this.

14:32.871 --> 14:35.541
I know. You told me.

14:39.086 --> 14:44.842
Hiding from the guard
in the canoe, with...

14:44.925 --> 14:47.970
-a boy.
-Oh.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.140
What boy?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.392
I don't know.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.937
Was it the other
"Marc with a C"?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.064
(laughs)

15:09.742 --> 15:12.536
What are you?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.955
What are you talking about?

15:15.956 --> 15:17.458
There's a trick.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.959
There has to be.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.004
-Oh, yeah?
-How could you possibly know

15:22.087 --> 15:24.340
that the guard
wasn't gonna turn around?

15:24.423 --> 15:27.426
How could you know that the guy
was gonna drop his gum?

15:28.427 --> 15:31.388
You have a secret.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.265
Do I?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.226
You do have a secret.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.811
What's your secret?

15:37.895 --> 15:40.814
-Tell me your secret.
-Ow. (laughs)

15:42.566 --> 15:47.196
You have to tell me,
before any funny business.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.365
Funny business?

15:49.448 --> 15:52.409
Yeah.
(chuckles)

15:57.706 --> 16:00.668
Okay. But, uh, first,
let's get on dry land.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.878
No. No, no, no.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.047
Marc, tell me your secret.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.174
-(whispers): Marc.
-Oh, is this a rotunda?

16:07.257 --> 16:10.386
No... Marc.

16:10.469 --> 16:14.390
(sound effect of birds chirping)

16:14.473 --> 16:16.725
Want to get naked?
The security camera's broken.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.728
Marc, if you don't tell me
your secret, I swear to God...

16:20.771 --> 16:23.065
What are you gonna do?

16:23.148 --> 16:26.694
I'm-I'm gonna kick your ass.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.946
Oh, shit.
Well, I better do what you say.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.781
(chuckles):
Uh, yeah, that's right.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.284
I guess I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.245
Okay.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.538
(grunts)

16:38.997 --> 16:42.042
You haven't met me, but...

16:42.126 --> 16:44.795
(chuckles)
I've met you.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.632
Literally what does that mean?

16:48.716 --> 16:50.551
Exactly what I said.

16:50.634 --> 16:54.138
No, you... No, you can't answer
a question with a riddle.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.598
(laughs):
Sorry.

16:56.682 --> 17:00.811
I-I-- Like, h-how do you know
all of this, all this stuff?

17:01.854 --> 17:05.273
How did you catch that bottle?

17:05.357 --> 17:08.234
Did you know that I was gonna
get hit by that truck?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.282
Are you magic?

17:15.200 --> 17:18.369
Uh, kind of. Yeah.

17:18.454 --> 17:23.791
The reason I know all this is...
uh, well, I know everything.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.461
Okay.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.964
I know that you and I
are the same.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.632
On a very deep level.

17:30.716 --> 17:35.596
I know that we both
long to be free.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.807
I know, I know.
We live very blessed lives.

17:38.891 --> 17:43.103
Like, the top one percent
luckiest <i> Homo sapiens</i> ever.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.397
It's literally not
an exaggeration.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.025
Inside...

17:50.611 --> 17:51.987
...we're caged.

17:54.072 --> 17:56.283
That's why you're so fascinated
with reincarnation, right?

17:56.366 --> 17:58.202
It's another chance
to start over, you know?

17:58.285 --> 18:00.329
Outside the cage.

18:00.412 --> 18:04.917
I know that you're afraid
that you only like assholes.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.378
'Cause a lot of guys
you've liked have been assholes.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.464
And that's a thing, you know?

18:10.547 --> 18:12.132
Women can be attracted
to assholes.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.717
It signals confidence.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.970
But I think that's it, right?
That's what it is.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.055
You're attracted
to the confidence.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.640
You don't like assholes.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.391
You just like people
who know who they are.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.608
You know, I think this
is my favorite work of art.

18:29.691 --> 18:30.901
It really captures something.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.861
You know?
The power, the dominance.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.073
The way that bird is crushing
the people beneath his feet.

18:36.156 --> 18:41.703
It's almost exactly
the opposite of that.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.206
The raven's saving them.
Freeing them.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.208
Coaxing them into the world.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.584
Huh.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.921
Well, you know what?

18:51.004 --> 18:53.757
I used to live in a clam,
and in retrospect,

18:53.841 --> 18:56.385
{\an5}-the birds were
super helpful, so...
-(laughs)

18:56.468 --> 18:58.053
Yeah, you might be
onto something there.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.556
(laughs):
So stupid.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.058
Marc.
(sighs)

19:03.141 --> 19:05.185
Okay.

19:05.269 --> 19:09.439
Almost everything
you're saying, I'm like,

19:09.523 --> 19:13.026
"Yes, totally,
you're speaking my language."

19:13.110 --> 19:16.530
But to be honest,

19:16.613 --> 19:18.615
I mean, you're also
kind of freaking me out.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.368
I'm sorry. Shit.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.204
You have to tell me
what's going on.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.916
Yeah. Look, I said I'd be honest
with you, so, uh,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.960
here it goes.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.087
(chuckles)

19:32.170 --> 19:34.756
Um...

19:34.840 --> 19:37.801
I've been working
on this date for...

19:37.885 --> 19:39.553
well, I don't even know
how long.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.097
I've done all this before.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.641
Many times.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.518
I don't really know how many.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.145
I don't know-- the number
of tries is probably somewhere

19:48.228 --> 19:51.273
-in the triple digits by now.
-"Tries"?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.276
(exhales):
Uh...

19:54.359 --> 19:57.779
Look, this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

19:57.863 --> 20:03.493
every time I go to sleep,
or... w-- die...

20:05.537 --> 20:09.917
...I wake up, this morning,
and start all over again.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.255
(laughs)
I...

20:22.387 --> 20:25.974
For you, for everyone else in
the world, as far as I can tell,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.185
it's the first time
today's happened.

20:28.268 --> 20:31.188
{\an5}-But for me...
-You're stuck
in a time loop, yeah.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.857
-Happened to my cousin once.
-(laughs)

20:33.941 --> 20:37.402
Trust me when I say
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.489
Oh, yeah, sorry,
I-I just have this thing

20:40.572 --> 20:42.824
where whenever somebody tells me
they're stuck in a time loop,

20:42.908 --> 20:44.326
I get all cynical about it.
I don't know why.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.827
{\an5}-(watch beeping)
-I guess I just...
-Okay.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.287
Your best friend growing up
was named Sally,

20:47.371 --> 20:49.164
even though she was mean to you.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.208
This guy over here
is about to sneeze.

20:51.291 --> 20:55.295
{\an5}-(sneezes)
-You have a recurring dream
about overflowing toilets.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.674
{\an5}-Two more sneezes and then the
sun's gonna go behind a cloud.
-(sneezing)

20:58.757 --> 21:00.467
One time your dad
kicked a hole in the wall

21:00.550 --> 21:02.636
and it felt like
the end of the world.

21:02.719 --> 21:03.845
You'd never admit it to anyone,

21:03.929 --> 21:06.264
but you used
to call yourself a poet.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.517
You still have a soft spot
for some of those poems.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.395
It's Ned, right?
How's your nephew feeling?

21:11.478 --> 21:13.355
Uh, yeah, much better, thanks.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.190
Looks like he's gonna
be all right.

21:15.273 --> 21:17.150
-Do we know each other?
-No.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.194
Your first kiss was Johnny
Driver at Wataka Summer Camp.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.029
You know all the lyrics
to "We Didn't Start the Fire"

21:21.113 --> 21:22.364
and "Kokomo."

21:22.447 --> 21:24.741
As a kid, you used to secretly
look at your grandpa's <i> Playboys.</i>

21:24.825 --> 21:26.410
You still feel a little
weird about that.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.328
Last night you had a dream
about moving out

21:28.412 --> 21:29.871
of your college dorm,
but you hadn't packed yet.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.415
Okay, dude, what the fuck?!

21:31.498 --> 21:32.541
I know all of this
because I've had

21:32.624 --> 21:35.711
a thousand conversations
with you over a thousand days.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.547
Or one day
over a thousand times.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.382
I'm the world's foremost
leading expert on today.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.550
I've lived it over
and over again.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.051
I know it inside and out.

21:45.095 --> 21:48.390
But it's not so bad.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.726
I pretty much do
whatever I want.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.438
Not to mention the fact that,
since it keeps resetting...

21:56.148 --> 21:58.358
...nothing really counts.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.068
So life without consequence.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.612
You know, life...
outside the cage.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.951
But that's the thing, I don't
want to do whatever I want.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.619
There's only one thing I want.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.414
There's only one thing
I care about anymore.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.292
There's a whole universe,
Claudia, right here.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.711
And the only thing
that matters in it

22:17.794 --> 22:20.630
is you and me.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.261
So...

22:31.141 --> 22:33.894
...this is the first time
I've met you.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.066
Um, but for you, it...

22:39.149 --> 22:40.901
it's like the millionth
in a row?

22:40.984 --> 22:42.778
(watch beeping)

22:42.861 --> 22:44.237
More or less.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.282
But then, that means...

22:47.365 --> 22:50.452
Sorry, there's gonna be, like,
a noisy helicopter here.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.497
(helicopter passes overhead)

22:56.041 --> 22:57.167
Okay, sorry.
You were saying

22:57.250 --> 23:00.170
millionth in a row?

23:00.253 --> 23:02.380
(exhales sharply)

23:14.226 --> 23:19.022
Th-The thing I'm having
a little trouble

23:19.106 --> 23:21.024
wrapping my mind around...

23:21.108 --> 23:23.527
You know what,
I wouldn't even try.

23:23.610 --> 23:26.488
Trust me,
I've had plenty of time,

23:26.571 --> 23:28.865
and the best I can
come up with is

23:28.949 --> 23:31.535
there are some puzzles that
weren't meant to be solved.

23:31.618 --> 23:35.288
No. I mean, sure, but th-that's
not what I'm talking about.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.291
I'm-I'm talking about how...

23:38.375 --> 23:40.627
you-you've had time to practice.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.671
-Uh, yeah. (chuckles)
-(watch beeps)

23:42.754 --> 23:44.673
Nothing but. In fact...

23:44.756 --> 23:46.174
check it out.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.510
I love this guy.
(laughs)

23:48.593 --> 23:52.514
We have this whole, uh,
commedia dell'arte routine

23:52.597 --> 23:53.932
worked out;
you're gonna love this.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.644
What's the deal with the watch?

23:57.727 --> 23:59.604
Uh...

24:04.276 --> 24:07.195
I said I was gonna
tell you the truth.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.240
This hot little number
holds up to

24:10.323 --> 24:11.575
50 separate alarms.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.034
So every time I start over,

24:13.118 --> 24:14.494
I program in a bunch
of different reminders.

24:14.578 --> 24:18.915
Like, uh, at 3:04 p.m. today,
a bunch of school kids

24:18.999 --> 24:20.000
run through here.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.502
I don't want to look at my watch
every 15 seconds,

24:22.586 --> 24:24.171
so when the alarm goes off
at 3:03,

24:24.254 --> 24:25.380
I know that's a minute away.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.507
You don't have to see
the whole clown act,

24:27.591 --> 24:30.594
but my intel on George here
is still good for one thing.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.636
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.596
What are you doing?

24:32.679 --> 24:34.222
Marc.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.433
(chuckles)

24:36.516 --> 24:38.059
He's not gonna turn around.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.352
Marc, put it back.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.396
You know, we can actually make
a surprising amount of noise.

24:41.479 --> 24:42.689
(vocalizing)

24:42.772 --> 24:45.859
Marc, that's an artifact

24:45.942 --> 24:48.069
with meaning to some people;
put it back.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.281
Whoa, where was this thing
on the canoe, huh?

24:51.364 --> 24:53.241
Old Georgie Porgie's
hard of hearing.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.409
(quietly):
Georgie Porgie?

24:57.162 --> 24:59.414
-(gasps)
-Home run.

24:59.497 --> 25:01.374
See, I knew you wouldn't
mind me doing that.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.418
A lot of people, they wouldn't
get that's a joke, but...

25:03.501 --> 25:06.796
I just know you so well.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.257
Plus, I've tried it before.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.885
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.220
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.223
No, I mean about practice.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.766
Oh, right.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.517
Well, look, this might sound
a little weird

25:19.601 --> 25:21.519
for me to say, but...

25:23.480 --> 25:24.606
...I'm kind of the perfect guy.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.983
I mean, if I ever
make a mistake,

25:27.067 --> 25:30.570
I can just go back
and try it again.

25:31.655 --> 25:32.447
(horn blares)

25:32.530 --> 25:33.406
(owl hoots)

25:33.490 --> 25:36.618
<i>-(timer dings)</i>
<i>-Practice makes perfect,</i>

25:36.701 --> 25:40.956
<i>so you practice.</i>

25:41.039 --> 25:42.624
Oh, shit.
Hey. Hey!

25:42.707 --> 25:44.334
Hey.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.003
Did you see that truck?

25:47.087 --> 25:49.631
It almost hit you.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.509
Okay...

25:52.592 --> 25:54.719
<i>It can be a lot of practice.</i>

25:55.804 --> 25:57.347
(horn blares)

25:57.430 --> 25:59.307
<i>(timer dings)</i>

25:59.391 --> 26:01.142
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.644
Hey. Hey!

26:02.727 --> 26:04.854
-Watch out!
-(tires screeching)

26:06.398 --> 26:09.067
Jesus Christ.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.860
<i>But you practice...</i>

26:10.944 --> 26:11.945
DRIVER:
What the hell's wrong with you?

26:12.028 --> 26:14.072
<i>...and you practice.</i>

26:15.156 --> 26:16.324
(horn blares)

26:16.408 --> 26:18.118
<i>(timer dings)</i>

26:18.201 --> 26:19.452
<i>And eventually...</i>

26:20.912 --> 26:22.414
I got you.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.126
(people gasping)

26:27.752 --> 26:28.670
<i>(timer dings)</i>

26:28.753 --> 26:31.548
...you do make perfect.

26:31.631 --> 26:35.051
So, basically, you've been
tricking me this whole time.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.013
Tricking you?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.180
No, I-I don't think
you understand.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.474
This has all been for you.

26:44.227 --> 26:47.147
Okay, I...

26:47.230 --> 26:49.482
I think I do understand.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.819
Look, you have no way
of knowing

26:52.902 --> 26:54.237
how much work
I've put into this,

26:54.321 --> 26:55.530
how many iterations.

26:55.613 --> 26:58.158
All the tries.

26:59.784 --> 27:00.618
<i>(timer dings)</i>

27:00.702 --> 27:02.996
What do you think
this guy's name is?

27:03.079 --> 27:04.914
Uh, John Thompson?

27:04.998 --> 27:06.708
(chuckles nervously)

27:06.791 --> 27:08.793
This guy's name is
John Johnson.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.255
Bill Thompson.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.593
Phil Thom-Thompson.

27:16.676 --> 27:19.095
-Bob Johnson.
-(laughs)

27:19.179 --> 27:21.890
(chuckles):
Okay.

27:21.973 --> 27:25.060
It's all about you.

27:25.143 --> 27:28.188
That's all it's ever been.

27:28.271 --> 27:31.900
It's about trying
to get this right.

27:31.983 --> 27:33.526
Getting what right?

27:33.610 --> 27:36.404
Like, what are you trying
to get right?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.114
Why are you doing this?

27:40.492 --> 27:44.079
Because... I love you.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.467
You don't know me.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.094
I don't know you?

27:59.177 --> 28:01.763
I know you better than
anyone has ever known anybody.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.515
I've spent years with you.

28:03.598 --> 28:07.435
Even if that's true,
I haven't spent years with you.

28:07.519 --> 28:11.272
Okay, okay, um, look,
you asked me

28:11.356 --> 28:13.775
what I want out of all this.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.402
It's not like I'm trying
to impress you, okay?

28:15.485 --> 28:17.112
I'm not trying to win you over.
I've done that.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.073
We've been together many times.

28:20.156 --> 28:22.283
But I'm sorry, it's just--

28:22.367 --> 28:24.285
It's not enough.
It doesn't cut it.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.455
I won't be satisfied with
anything less than all of you.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.917
You also asked me why
today keeps repeating.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.293
No, I didn't.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.129
Yeah, you did.
It was--

28:34.212 --> 28:38.007
I said, like, it's a puzzle
that can't be solved.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.802
If I'm really honest
with myself,

28:40.885 --> 28:42.846
I think it's for you
and me to connect.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.347
I mean, really connect.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.641
And not just through trickery,
not temporarily,

28:46.724 --> 28:49.185
but for real.

28:49.269 --> 28:53.314
That's why I'm being
totally honest with you.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.942
I just...
(sighs)

28:56.025 --> 28:57.527
I just want you to love me.

28:57.610 --> 29:00.029
Marc, I-I just met you.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.115
Yeah, but I didn't just
meet you.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.492
Oh, Claudia, look,

29:04.576 --> 29:07.120
you're gonna have to
take my word for it, okay?

29:07.203 --> 29:08.329
We connect.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.290
We do.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.125
We're meant for each other.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.335
And I can carry that
from one day to the next,

29:14.419 --> 29:15.587
even if you can't.

29:15.670 --> 29:17.005
I can learn, I-I can...

29:17.088 --> 29:19.215
You can manipulate me.
You can lie to me.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.426
That's what you're describing.

29:21.509 --> 29:22.844
You can take advantage of me.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.679
What? No.
What-- That's not it at all.

29:24.762 --> 29:28.016
Um, excuse me.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.143
What are you gonna do?
You're not gonna make a scene.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.686
You don't have it in you.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.399
What do you want from me?

29:36.483 --> 29:38.943
I just--

29:39.027 --> 29:42.489
I want you to love me
beyond the day.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.032
Not just to fall in love
with me.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.825
I want you to <i> be</i>
in love with me.

29:45.909 --> 29:49.370
So when you see me, it's like,
"Oh, right. You!

29:49.454 --> 29:52.874
Hi, soul mate."

29:52.957 --> 29:56.503
That can't happen,
even if I wanted it to.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.712
Which I don't.

29:57.795 --> 29:59.088
-It can happen.
-No.

29:59.172 --> 30:03.218
No. If... if I'm starting over
every time,

30:03.301 --> 30:06.095
-that's literally impossible.
-Claudia.

30:06.179 --> 30:09.349
You're not listening to me.

30:09.432 --> 30:12.727
What we have, it's real, it's--

30:12.810 --> 30:14.729
I mean, it's magical.

30:14.812 --> 30:17.732
You think I'm why you're
stuck in this time loop?

30:17.815 --> 30:21.361
No. I-- Or yeah, maybe.
I don't know.

30:21.444 --> 30:25.740
It doesn't matter.
The point is, Claudia,

30:25.823 --> 30:27.867
whether I'm in a loop
or out of it...

30:31.329 --> 30:33.081
...I want to spend forever
with you.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.124
Okay, dude, no.

30:35.208 --> 30:38.378
I-I get that this is
a whole romantic

30:38.461 --> 30:40.630
thing for you, but for me,

30:40.713 --> 30:43.633
this whole thing feels
super fucked-up,

30:43.716 --> 30:44.634
to be honest.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.970
I'm sorry if that's not
what you want to hear,

30:47.053 --> 30:49.722
but I need you to know I don't
feel comfortable right now,

30:49.806 --> 30:51.307
like, at all.

30:51.391 --> 30:54.602
Wow.
(chuckles)

30:54.686 --> 30:57.605
There's no romantic moment
that you can't ruin,

30:57.689 --> 30:59.232
is there?

31:00.441 --> 31:03.444
You know, this isn't the first
time I told you I loved you,

31:03.528 --> 31:05.613
but it's the first time
I did it right.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.074
I told you the whole truth,
and look,

31:08.157 --> 31:09.826
you still won't let me in.

31:09.909 --> 31:12.453
(laughs): It doesn't matter
what I do, does it?

31:12.537 --> 31:15.206
-Listen, dude...
-You're lucky I'm nice.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.875
What's that supposed to mean?

31:20.378 --> 31:22.964
Nothing. I'm kidding.
Just kidding.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.591
So, uh, what should we do?

31:24.674 --> 31:27.385
Where you going? Okay.

31:29.554 --> 31:34.309
Okay. I wish you could just see
how much effort I put into it.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.103
(sighs)
You don't even know.

31:37.186 --> 31:40.148
Like, my name is Mark.

31:40.231 --> 31:42.150
But just regular Mark, with a K.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.611
I knew if I threw
that C action in there,

31:44.694 --> 31:46.904
you'd think of that lame story
from seventh grade.

31:49.532 --> 31:53.161
Do you honestly not see
how fucked-up that is?

31:53.244 --> 31:56.205
"Fucked-up"? What-- I mean,
what does that mean?

31:56.289 --> 31:58.666
What are you saying?
Like, "bad"?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.877
As opposed to "good"?
Let me tell you something.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.172
You live one day a thousand
times, your whole perspective

32:04.255 --> 32:07.175
on the concept of good--
"Look at me, I'm good"--

32:07.258 --> 32:08.509
isn't that just me selfishly
trying to look

32:08.593 --> 32:10.053
like I'm doing the right thing?

32:10.136 --> 32:12.388
Except if you're trying
to manipulate someone.

32:12.472 --> 32:15.350
Then you're wielding
some kind of power?

32:15.433 --> 32:16.601
You're tricking someone
either way.

32:16.684 --> 32:20.229
And-and who even came up with
the whole "all power is evil"?

32:20.313 --> 32:24.150
If you think about it, I mean,
what even is evil? (scoffs)

32:24.233 --> 32:27.528
No, you're just so caught up in
this whole worn-out value system

32:27.612 --> 32:29.572
of good and bad,
you can't really see...

32:29.656 --> 32:30.948
Okay, enough
with the freshman philosophy.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.076
This isn't about a value system.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.702
All we are is what we do,

32:34.786 --> 32:37.080
so stop acting
like a fucking creep.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.873
Claudia, Claudia, Claudia,
listen to me.

32:38.956 --> 32:41.501
I know you can see through this
to the truth, to the freedom

32:41.584 --> 32:42.710
-that we both want.
-No, no, no, no.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.045
We-we want different freedoms.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.505
You want the freedom to do

32:45.588 --> 32:47.173
whatever you want
without feeling judged.

32:47.256 --> 32:50.885
I want freedom to not be
harassed and-and menaced.

32:50.968 --> 32:52.845
(chuckles):
Menaced? What?

32:52.929 --> 32:54.722
I-I know you're not
trying to hurt me.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.017
But if you could just take
a step back and-and see it

32:58.101 --> 33:00.228
-from my perspective.
-What about from my perspective?

33:00.311 --> 33:01.688
-Your perspective?
-Yeah, what about all the days,

33:01.771 --> 33:03.439
what about all the tries,
all the effort?

33:03.523 --> 33:05.066
I mean, I've learned things,
Claudia.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.026
I've changed... for you.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.904
This is what I was trying to say
earlier, about practice.

33:09.987 --> 33:11.364
I wasn't, I wasn't there.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.408
Not me. "Me" me, this me.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.076
So you weren't
practicing with me,

33:15.159 --> 33:18.371
like in sports
or play rehearsals.

33:18.454 --> 33:21.791
You were practicing
to do something to me,

33:21.874 --> 33:25.420
like... a terrorist.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.256
If you care about me
like you say you care about me,

33:28.339 --> 33:30.258
what am I missing?

33:30.341 --> 33:32.760
Not philosophically. Personally.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.264
I know for a fact
that you've loved me.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.725
That's it?

33:38.808 --> 33:41.310
That's your whole thing?
I-I've loved you?

33:41.394 --> 33:44.439
-Yeah, you even said it once.
-Even if I did,

33:44.522 --> 33:47.150
y-you, you think
you're owed it now?

33:47.233 --> 33:49.402
-Come on...
-No, really.

33:49.485 --> 33:52.196
Y-You think, you-you managed
to get a yes out of me once,

33:52.280 --> 33:55.950
then, what,
it-it's "no backsies" forever

33:56.033 --> 33:57.160
from that point forward?

33:57.243 --> 33:58.578
Obviously not what I'm saying.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.455
I'm another human being, Mark.

34:00.538 --> 34:04.083
-Well, sort of.
-What does that mean?

34:08.004 --> 34:10.465
Well, it's--
basically, you aren't even real.

34:10.547 --> 34:15.178
I-I mean, you're real, but after
today's over, I'll just have

34:15.261 --> 34:18.806
another try and then another,
and then everything

34:18.889 --> 34:20.808
that happened here
didn't happen here anymore.

34:20.891 --> 34:24.145
So I guess you could say, in
the realest sense, you aren't.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.813
Think about what you're saying.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.107
Claudia, do you think
there's anything

34:28.190 --> 34:29.192
that I haven't thought about?

34:29.275 --> 34:31.652
If I'm not real,

34:31.735 --> 34:35.156
then... I don't matter.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.949
That could justify anything.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.826
It could, couldn't it?

34:38.909 --> 34:41.829
(chuckles) Here I was,
getting all bent out of shape

34:41.913 --> 34:43.706
because you rejected me again,

34:43.790 --> 34:45.666
even though
I did everything right.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.543
But when I think about it,
it's kind of a net win.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.172
I mean, I've never
gotten this far.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.967
I gained a valuable insight
to the whole thing.

34:55.051 --> 34:58.638
You know, we don't have to waste
the rest of this try.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.517
Don't do anything stupid.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.519
Okay.
(laughs)

35:04.602 --> 35:07.355
I mean, think about it.
What does it even matter?

35:07.438 --> 35:09.982
I've lived this day
a thousand times.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.692
I mean, I'm probably
never gonna stop living it.

35:11.776 --> 35:16.572
So whatever I do to you, I mean,
even if I killed you...

35:16.656 --> 35:19.200
There'd just be another you
here tomorrow

35:19.283 --> 35:20.660
who doesn't even know about it.

35:20.743 --> 35:24.872
Oh-- just h-hold on. Um...

35:24.956 --> 35:26.541
What about this me?

35:26.624 --> 35:28.501
I mean, what we do is happening.

35:28.584 --> 35:32.880
Just because you move on from it
doesn't mean that it's not real.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.925
Look, I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.718
No, Mark, I ju...

35:37.802 --> 35:40.513
I said I don't want to have
this conversation anymore, okay?

35:40.596 --> 35:42.348
Can we change the subject?

35:42.431 --> 35:43.891
Yeah. Know what?

35:45.810 --> 35:47.895
Let's try something
a little different this time.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.814
Help!

35:49.897 --> 35:52.441
-Help! Is anybody there?
-MARK: Claudia...

35:52.525 --> 35:55.236
Come on. No one can
hear you back here.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.446
-Help!
-Ah, this place is like a maze.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.699
-Help!
-Boo.

35:59.782 --> 36:01.576
(panting)

36:03.661 --> 36:05.037
(laughs)

36:05.121 --> 36:06.706
You're so predictable.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.916
Funny thing is,
we've never done this before.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.585
I just know you so well.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.045
Whoa! No, no, no, no.
(laughs)

36:13.129 --> 36:15.047
We've never gotten
physical before.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.299
Well, not like this.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.842
-(grunts)
-Asshole!

36:17.925 --> 36:21.095
Oh, no. Not my magical watch.

36:21.178 --> 36:22.763
(laughs)

36:22.847 --> 36:26.434
That's just my cheat sheet.
What else you got?

36:26.517 --> 36:28.978
Mark, you know this is wrong.

36:29.061 --> 36:32.273
Yeah. I probably will feel
pretty bad about this,

36:32.356 --> 36:33.983
for about a hundred days or so.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.112
What? You gonna run?

36:38.195 --> 36:40.197
Run. But just know,

36:40.281 --> 36:44.619
I'm gonna be chasing you down
every single time.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.914
(exhales)
Well, then...

36:47.997 --> 36:50.333
I'm just gonna have to kick
your ass every single time.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.043
(watch clatters)

37:02.845 --> 37:04.305
What do you think
you're gonna do?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.474
I mean, I'm not saying
I'm a god, necessarily,

37:06.557 --> 37:09.101
but I've lived this day
so many times

37:09.185 --> 37:11.312
and in so many different ways,
I'm pretty much

37:11.395 --> 37:13.481
the puppe-fucking-teer
of the universe.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.442
I know you better
than you know yourself.

37:16.525 --> 37:18.444
So I guess the real question is,

37:18.527 --> 37:20.613
what do you think
you're gonna do?

37:20.696 --> 37:23.199
I think I'm...

37:23.282 --> 37:24.825
(exhales)

37:24.909 --> 37:27.328
...I'm gonna kick your ass
back into yesterday.

37:27.411 --> 37:31.165
Oh, okay. Well, you sound
super confident about that.

37:31.248 --> 37:33.709
(laughs): Look, are you sure
you don't want to just give up?

37:33.793 --> 37:36.754
Right now?
We could have a little fun?

37:36.837 --> 37:39.340
{\an5}-I mean, this doesn't
have to be a fight.
-Fuck you.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.634
Yeah, I know, that's kind of
what I was thinking.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.637
Look, I'm a man, okay?

37:44.720 --> 37:47.306
I know I'm not supposed
to feel that, right?

37:47.390 --> 37:49.475
I mean, I'm certainly not
supposed to say it.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.894
But the fact of the matter is,
I am a man.

37:51.978 --> 37:55.314
Men dominate. That's what we do.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.525
We always have. Oh, my gosh.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.528
I hope that doesn't trigger you
or whatever.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.572
But I guess you'll just be
untriggered before you know it,

38:03.656 --> 38:06.033
so, you know,
I'm just gonna start doing

38:06.117 --> 38:08.077
whatever the fuck I want, okay?

38:09.286 --> 38:11.038
Who am I?

38:12.748 --> 38:14.667
I'm the bad guy!

38:14.750 --> 38:15.835
(cackles)

38:15.918 --> 38:17.670
Ooh.
(chuckles)

38:17.753 --> 38:19.755
God, it's the only way
you'll have me.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.385
(exhales)
You don't have to do this.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.262
Oh, I don't? Oh, thank God!

38:26.345 --> 38:27.555
(chuckles)

38:27.638 --> 38:31.559
Look, this is what we're doing.

38:31.642 --> 38:35.187
Tomorrow I'm gonna go back
to being nice again.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.939
But today?

38:37.023 --> 38:39.608
(à la Bruce Lee):
Wah... wah...

38:39.692 --> 38:41.694
We're doing this.
(hooting)

38:43.612 --> 38:45.698
Come on, this is exciting.

38:45.781 --> 38:47.408
This is my first time
doing this, too.

38:49.326 --> 38:51.037
I-- it's unfair.
I know you so well.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.080
Tell you what,
we'll make it interesting.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.915
It you can land even one punch,

38:54.999 --> 38:56.625
I will personally
give you a thous...

38:58.419 --> 39:00.212
(shouts)

39:01.338 --> 39:02.965
(chuckles)

39:03.049 --> 39:04.800
Well, that's never gonna work...

39:06.510 --> 39:07.720
(yells)

39:11.348 --> 39:12.892
Oh...

39:12.975 --> 39:15.269
-Fuck!
-Yeah. You done?

39:15.352 --> 39:17.772
{\an5}-Oh, God.
-Took you how long
to become a god?

39:17.855 --> 39:21.275
{\an5}-Oh, fuck...
-Puppe-fucking-teer
of the universe?

39:21.358 --> 39:23.652
-(whimpering)
-'Cause I just kicked your ass

39:23.736 --> 39:25.279
on the first try, motherfucker.

39:25.362 --> 39:26.655
Oh, shit.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.657
-(panting)
-Oh, fuck.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.118
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.246
{\an5}GUARD:
Okay, we got him.
Let's get him out of here.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.123
-(laughs)
-Come on.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.125
Get up.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.169
What do you think you achieved?

39:40.252 --> 39:41.837
Besides the obvious?

39:41.921 --> 39:43.798
You're not gonna remember
what happened here today.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.467
But I will.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.969
Look, as soon as I go
to sleep tonight,

39:49.053 --> 39:51.263
I'll be right back here
with other yous.

39:51.347 --> 39:52.640
Yous who don't know
what you know now.

39:52.723 --> 39:53.724
Yous who think that the...

39:55.893 --> 39:58.187
Mes who what?

39:59.730 --> 40:01.315
Yeah.

40:01.398 --> 40:03.984
I think they're gonna be able
to handle themselves.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.070
(exhales)

40:11.117 --> 40:13.661
(speaking indistinctly)

40:24.922 --> 40:26.966
(chuckles)

40:34.515 --> 40:36.642
(sighs)

40:36.725 --> 40:39.979
Claudia King will,
like most of us,

40:40.062 --> 40:43.149
proceed directly
to a lifetime of tomorrows,

40:43.232 --> 40:45.734
leaving Mark Wheeler
to spend an eternity

40:45.818 --> 40:47.862
in a prison of his own design:

40:47.945 --> 40:52.825
the inability, no matter
how many tries he's given,

40:52.908 --> 40:56.036
to see beyond himself.

40:56.120 --> 40:59.748
An endless loop
of solitary confinement here

40:59.832 --> 41:01.750
in The Twilight Zone.
