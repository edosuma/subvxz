00:02.136 --> 00:03.203
You know, Emma...

00:03.253 --> 00:05.755
My mother always told me
that the way to a man's heart

00:05.789 --> 00:07.523
was through his stomach...

00:07.557 --> 00:10.513
Which is exactly where she shot
grandpa when she caught him cheating.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.629
Hey, mom, what's going on?

00:13.663 --> 00:17.199
Is it just me,
or when I left did I only have one baby?

00:17.234 --> 00:19.201
This is Dylan from daycare.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.569
They're on their first playdate.

00:20.604 --> 00:24.874
Uh, no, no, that's impossible,
because my daughter will not be dating.

00:24.908 --> 00:25.941
Ever.

00:25.976 --> 00:28.110
I wish I had a playdate.

00:28.145 --> 00:30.813
I mean, it's not right that
Emma's getting some and I'm not.

00:30.847 --> 00:32.747
And you're not gonna be right
if you ever use the words

00:32.783 --> 00:34.683
"Emma" and "getting some"
in the same sentence again.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.953
Hey, punk.

00:37.988 --> 00:40.723
I was your age once, okay.
I know exactly what you're thinking.

00:40.757 --> 00:42.358
I'm watching you, Dylan.

00:43.593 --> 00:45.394
Oh, wait,
did you... did you just wink at her?

00:45.429 --> 00:48.297
Oh, no, no, no, nope.
No, we're done. Let's go.

00:48.331 --> 00:51.133
Wow, she really is getting more than me.

00:51.168 --> 00:53.069
I forgot, man. I'm sorry.

00:53.103 --> 00:54.437
You're dead.

00:57.107 --> 01:00.042
<i>â™ª It's amazing how
the unexpected â™ª</i>

01:00.077 --> 01:02.948

01:07.250 --> 01:08.984
Oh...

01:09.019 --> 01:12.054
Doing a little online lady shopping, I see.

01:12.089 --> 01:14.256
Very nice!

01:14.291 --> 01:15.357
Here, click on her.

01:15.392 --> 01:19.095
Why? She's not gonna click me back,

01:19.129 --> 01:21.297
and I'll spend all weekend clicking myself.

01:24.468 --> 01:27.002
Tucker...

01:27.037 --> 01:28.337
Come on, man, where's your confidence?

01:28.371 --> 01:31.040
Here, let me show you how this
is supposed to work, all right.

01:31.074 --> 01:34.276
Like... like...
Like, like, like, like, like.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.412
Dude, what are you doing?

01:36.446 --> 01:38.414
You're not even seeing if we're compatible.

01:38.448 --> 01:42.118
Compatible? She likes guys, you like girls.

01:43.153 --> 01:45.121
If you're lucky, she also likes girls.

01:47.057 --> 01:48.390
It's practically fate.

01:48.425 --> 01:51.093
That's what you're calling fate these days?

01:51.128 --> 01:54.196
The modern dating
world is a cold place.

01:54.231 --> 01:56.398
Just filled with devices.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.000
And not the fun kind.

01:59.369 --> 02:03.005
Back in my day,
we had a little thing called romance.

02:03.039 --> 02:05.207
Yeah, you also had a little
thing called the plague.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.178
Look, I'm just saying, Tucker,

02:09.211 --> 02:10.979
that you need to put yourself out there

02:11.014 --> 02:13.249
and let love find you.

02:13.283 --> 02:15.184
You know,
I met your dad when accidentally dumped

02:15.218 --> 02:17.386
his tuna surprise in my
lap in the cafeteria.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.021
Oh...

02:19.055 --> 02:22.057
He felt so bad about it he
drove me home and that was that.

02:22.092 --> 02:24.994
Actually, "that" became Danny.

02:26.429 --> 02:28.063
Well, buck up, Tuck.

02:28.098 --> 02:30.299
I'm sure the woman of your
dreams is just around the corner.

02:30.333 --> 02:33.068
- You really think so?
- I don't know.

02:33.103 --> 02:34.470
I'm just spitballing,
trying to make you feel better.

02:39.042 --> 02:40.609
Mom, wait.

02:40.644 --> 02:41.318
I think you're right.

02:41.343 --> 02:43.269
That's exactly what I want
you to put on my tombstone.

02:45.081 --> 02:48.050
Tucker just needs some real romance in
his life to get his confidence back.

02:48.084 --> 02:51.086
So we're gonna give him a secret admirer.

02:51.121 --> 02:54.089
A fake one, since I'm not quite
sure where to find the real kind.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.293
Benjamin Bon Jovi Wheeler.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.197
That is wrong and deceitful,

03:01.231 --> 03:03.899
and as your mother,
I would just like to say,

03:03.934 --> 03:05.167
I've never been prouder. I'm in.

03:07.037 --> 03:08.771
Oh, hi. What's going on?

03:08.805 --> 03:11.040
Right now, wondering where I can
get my hands on a burner phone

03:11.074 --> 03:13.676
so I can send text messages
from a hot girl to Tucker.

03:14.744 --> 03:15.844
Seriously, why do I even ask?

03:18.815 --> 03:21.250
Wheeler, hey. So...

03:21.284 --> 03:24.220
Here is the suitcase you wanted to borrow.

03:24.254 --> 03:26.255
Going somewhere fun? I can join,

03:26.289 --> 03:29.158
because I am single and in the city.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.261
Ooh, that might be kind of awkward.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.130
Robyn and I are going away for
our first weekend together.

03:35.165 --> 03:38.033
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

03:38.068 --> 03:40.803
That would be awkward.
Maybe you shouldn't bring her.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.073
I'm just kidding.

03:44.107 --> 03:46.542
First weekend away, alone.

03:46.576 --> 03:47.843
That should be, uh...

03:47.877 --> 03:50.512
- Telling.
- Nah, we'll be fine.

03:50.547 --> 03:51.780
We're good together.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.617
Which I guess is kind of
the opposite of you and Ben.

03:55.685 --> 03:57.353
You ready to talk about that yet?

03:57.387 --> 03:58.387
What happened anyway?

03:58.421 --> 04:00.356
Oh...

04:00.390 --> 04:03.225
You know us. We just couldn't
get ourselves on the same page.

04:03.260 --> 04:06.095
That's one of the reasons
Robyn and I get along so well.

04:06.129 --> 04:07.830
Neither of us likes to read.

04:11.067 --> 04:13.068
So, uh, I'm an idiot.

04:13.103 --> 04:15.604
I'm sad and desperate.

04:15.639 --> 04:16.572
I win.

04:16.606 --> 04:18.807
He looked me right in the eye,

04:18.841 --> 04:20.809
and said, "so what happened, anyway?"

04:20.844 --> 04:23.345
Why didn't I just say, "you happened.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.247
You are what happened.
That's what happened"?

04:25.282 --> 04:26.348
What's happening right now?

04:27.350 --> 04:29.184
Why don't I just tell him that I like him?

04:30.320 --> 04:31.720
W-wait.

04:31.755 --> 04:34.957
Wait, are you saying that you
finally realized that you like Danny?

04:38.061 --> 04:39.895
Well, congratulations!

04:39.929 --> 04:42.031
You're officially the last to know.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.602
No, no.
Actually, Danny is the last one to know.

04:46.636 --> 04:48.871
Tucker, I have to tell him.

04:48.905 --> 04:51.774
I mean, I will not keep my
feelings bottled up this time.

04:51.808 --> 04:53.776
And he's about to go off
for the weekend with Robyn,

04:53.810 --> 04:55.744
so I need to get in there before he...

04:56.780 --> 04:58.480
Gets in there.

05:03.420 --> 05:05.087
Wait, Ben, Ben, Ben.

05:05.121 --> 05:06.455
You are not going to believe this.

05:06.489 --> 05:09.224
I have a secret admirer.

05:09.259 --> 05:12.061
What? Whoa, man. That's crazy.

05:12.095 --> 05:14.163
I, for one, am completely shocked.

05:14.197 --> 05:15.831
Shocked, I say.

05:18.168 --> 05:19.668
Oh my God, it's her.

05:21.037 --> 05:23.739
Dude, she's gorgeous.
She just sent me a picture.

05:23.773 --> 05:25.641
Really, a picture?

05:25.675 --> 05:26.742
Wow.

05:26.776 --> 05:28.811
Seems kind of odd for a secret admirer.

05:28.845 --> 05:31.547
Obviously someone is a
little unclear on the rules.

05:33.483 --> 05:36.352
And the Tuckster is back.

05:36.386 --> 05:37.553
Yes...

05:37.587 --> 05:39.221
See? There's the guy we've been missing.

05:39.255 --> 05:41.390
Now, you get out there,
and you like some girls, man.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.092
Like... like... ooh.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.294
Hi.

05:45.328 --> 05:48.030
You seriously could not be any cuter.

05:48.064 --> 05:49.131
Any chance I could buy you a drink?

05:50.133 --> 05:52.634
Wow, I'm flattered.

05:53.636 --> 05:54.870
But I kind of have a girlfriend, so...

05:56.639 --> 05:59.675
That's right, ladies. Spoken for.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.343
I'm sorry.

06:01.378 --> 06:02.578
I saw you looking.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.350
Wheeler! Wheeler!

06:08.385 --> 06:10.252
Oh, hey. What are you doing here?

06:10.286 --> 06:12.287
Oh,
I just wanted to talk to you about something.

06:12.322 --> 06:13.455
When you're done. Nothing important.

06:13.490 --> 06:15.958
Just sort of urgent. Kind of.

06:15.992 --> 06:17.226
Sure, 10 minutes.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.065
- Hi.
- Oh my God.

06:23.099 --> 06:25.768
Robyn, hi.

06:25.802 --> 06:26.921
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

06:26.946 --> 06:28.637
Otherwise, I would have
said something like,

06:28.671 --> 06:29.872
"hi, Robyn."

06:29.906 --> 06:31.740
I just came by to watch Danny practice.

06:31.775 --> 06:32.975
You know, like I always do.

06:33.009 --> 06:35.511
Nothing suspicious about that.

06:35.545 --> 06:37.579
No, not at all.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.649
But I was thinking maybe you
and I could talk as well.

06:40.683 --> 06:43.485
We need to figure out
how we fit into his life.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.188
Fit into his life?
Well, I'm his best friend.

06:46.222 --> 06:47.289
So I think we're cool.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.358
Come on, Riley. Don't even.

06:49.392 --> 06:52.060
He can tell me a million times that
you don't have feelings for him...

06:52.095 --> 06:53.929
he talks about me?

06:53.963 --> 06:56.165
But I am not believing it from you.

06:56.199 --> 06:58.667
So I'm hoping you can
just give us some space.

06:58.701 --> 06:59.835
Well, that's not really up to me.

06:59.869 --> 07:02.538
Oh,
I'll handle the Danny end of it.

07:02.572 --> 07:04.440
You're the one who needs to back off.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.376
Back off?

07:07.410 --> 07:09.611
Uh,
I will back off when I'm ready to back off,

07:09.646 --> 07:11.246
and I'm not ready.

07:11.281 --> 07:13.649
In fact, I am backing on.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.285
Hm, well, we'll see.

07:18.388 --> 07:20.255
Oh, sorry.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.157
My bad.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.259
Seriously, you just did that on purpose.

07:24.294 --> 07:25.928
Why would I do that?

07:25.962 --> 07:27.996
I don't know, same reason I did this.

07:29.098 --> 07:31.033
Could you be any more childish?

07:31.067 --> 07:32.801
Oh, I don't know. Let's see.

07:40.510 --> 07:42.411
Hey!

07:43.513 --> 07:44.713
- Danny!
- Danny!

07:46.516 --> 07:47.683
All right, Emma.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.485
Let's give this dating site a whirl.

07:49.519 --> 07:51.353
Dated him.

07:51.387 --> 07:54.189
Dated him. Dated him.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.124
Wait a minute. What is this?

07:56.159 --> 07:58.927
Oh, it's my contacts. Never mind.

07:58.962 --> 08:00.062
I know.

08:00.096 --> 08:02.664
Mom, what is the matter with you?

08:02.699 --> 08:04.633
Why did you send Tucker a
picture of his secret admirer?

08:04.667 --> 08:05.667
Who is now not so secret.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.536
Oh, calm down.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.704
I bought some new picture frames,

08:08.738 --> 08:10.472
and I thought that the
girl that came with them

08:10.507 --> 08:11.773
made a nice girlfriend for Tucker.

08:11.808 --> 08:13.542
See?

08:13.576 --> 08:14.610
She skis.

08:14.644 --> 08:16.645
She also doesn't exist.

08:16.679 --> 08:18.313
Which is a good thing,

08:18.348 --> 08:20.549
because she's not really his secret admirer.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.050
Jeez, keep up.

08:23.486 --> 08:25.387
Oh my God. I found her.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.856
I actually found my secret admirer.

08:31.861 --> 08:33.761
- I'm sorry, what?
- Yeah.

08:33.796 --> 08:35.664
I was coming out of the bar,
and there she was.

08:35.698 --> 08:36.765
It really is fate.

08:42.577 --> 08:45.345
Talked to her?

08:45.380 --> 08:47.014
No, I didn't.

08:47.048 --> 08:50.317
I ran after her, but I lost her when she
turned into that big building on the corner,

08:50.351 --> 08:53.120
which means I now know where she works,

08:53.154 --> 08:56.790
which means it's only a matter of
time before we meet face to face.

08:58.860 --> 09:00.661
Well, he seems happy.

09:00.695 --> 09:01.995
So I say, job well done.

09:02.030 --> 09:03.597
Yay, us.

09:03.631 --> 09:05.666
So I'll see you tomorrow.
Or not, I'm kind of busy.

09:05.700 --> 09:09.403
Whoa, you are not going anywhere
until we figure out what to do.

09:09.437 --> 09:10.637
God, maybe I should just tell him the truth.

09:10.672 --> 09:12.706
The truth? That never helped anybody.

09:12.740 --> 09:16.209
Look,
we just need to get to her before he does.

09:16.244 --> 09:18.345
How hard can it be to
find a model in New York?

09:18.379 --> 09:20.480
You'd be surprised.
I've been trying for years.

09:23.017 --> 09:24.251
You know, this is all your fault.

09:24.285 --> 09:26.053
My fault? This is so your fault.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.221
Ladies, how about we focus on Danny,

09:28.256 --> 09:30.023
and not worry about who did what to whom.

09:30.058 --> 09:32.893
Okay, you mean what she did to me, right?

09:32.927 --> 09:34.961
I just want to be clear on who's the who,

09:34.996 --> 09:36.563
and who's the whom.

09:37.899 --> 09:40.534
Danny's a little out of it right now,
but he'll be fine.

09:40.568 --> 09:42.436
I'll be back in a few minutes.

09:42.470 --> 09:43.704
Hopefully to an empty room.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.374
Well, thanks for stopping by.

09:47.408 --> 09:48.842
I think I got it from here.

09:48.876 --> 09:51.611
Oh, if you did, maybe it wouldn't have
taken you 20 years to figure it out.

09:53.381 --> 09:55.349
Danny, hi. It's me, Riley.

09:55.383 --> 09:57.184
I'm here for you.

09:57.218 --> 09:59.353
Danny, it's me, Robyn.

09:59.387 --> 10:01.221
I was actually here for you first.

10:02.924 --> 10:05.759
I love you R...

10:05.793 --> 10:07.127
Oh my God.

10:07.161 --> 10:09.629
I can't believe he said he loves me.

10:10.765 --> 10:12.566
He didn't say he loves you.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.634
He said he loves me, Robyn.

10:14.669 --> 10:17.671
I'm sorry, how did you get Robyn from that?

10:17.705 --> 10:19.539
He was clearly trying to say,

10:19.574 --> 10:21.641
I love you, Ruh-ley.

10:22.744 --> 10:24.511
He was saying Robyn.

10:24.545 --> 10:26.313
Uh, no, I'm pretty sure it was Ruh-ley.

10:26.347 --> 10:27.514
- Clearly Robyn.
- Riley.

10:27.548 --> 10:29.049
- It was Robyn.
- Riley.

10:31.119 --> 10:32.452
I'm sorry if I'm a little confused.

10:32.487 --> 10:35.288
My agent was pretty unclear about
the details of the job, so...

10:36.290 --> 10:37.958
You know, I used to be a model.

10:38.993 --> 10:40.727
What are you, like, 5'3 ", 5'4"?

10:41.729 --> 10:42.896
I bet you don't even ski.

10:45.466 --> 10:46.666
Look, Christine,

10:46.701 --> 10:49.703
it's not really a modeling job
so much as it is an acting job.

10:49.737 --> 10:52.406
We need you to pretend to be
our friend's secret admirer.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.473
It's super easy.

10:53.508 --> 10:56.209
- I'm still not following.
- Honey, I got this.

10:56.244 --> 10:57.210
I speak model.

10:57.245 --> 10:59.079
Hi. Hi.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.350
We will pay you

11:03.384 --> 11:07.888
100 American dollars

11:07.922 --> 11:09.823
to like our friend.

11:10.992 --> 11:12.959
I'm a model,

11:12.994 --> 11:13.994
not an escort.

11:14.962 --> 11:17.531
Pretty fine line sometimes, if I recall.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.668
Look, you don't understand.
We only want you to date him

11:21.702 --> 11:23.570
long enough to break up with him.

11:23.604 --> 11:26.239
Gently, or, you know,
whatever $100 will get us.

11:27.308 --> 11:29.376
You two are horrible people.

11:29.410 --> 11:30.410
I'm out of here.

11:30.445 --> 11:33.413
- Uh...
- Uh, w-wait, he's dying!

11:33.448 --> 11:35.115
- What?
- What?

11:35.149 --> 11:37.117
He's only got six weeks left to live,

11:37.151 --> 11:38.919
and his dying wish was
that he got to meet you.

11:39.921 --> 11:41.021
Really?

11:41.055 --> 11:43.757
Oh my God. Okay, well...

11:43.791 --> 11:45.859
I can't say no to a dying man's last wish.

11:45.893 --> 11:48.862
Neither could we. That's why we're here.

11:53.401 --> 11:55.302
Oh, Danny, I'm so sorry.

11:56.437 --> 11:58.338
I should have just told you how I feel.

11:59.540 --> 12:03.243
But I guess I'm still figuring it out too,
you know.

12:03.277 --> 12:05.011
I mean...

12:05.046 --> 12:06.346
I like Danny Wheeler.

12:08.015 --> 12:09.282
Oh my God, how crazy is that?

12:12.119 --> 12:13.186
It's true.

12:14.789 --> 12:15.922
I do.

12:17.492 --> 12:20.694
Oh, now if I could just find the courage
to say that to you when you're awake.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here

12:37.746 --> 12:40.681
<i> Ladies and gentlemen, I direct
your attention to the center line.</i>

12:42.684 --> 12:45.619
You know, Tucker...
First date, complete stranger,

12:45.654 --> 12:47.555
I probably wouldn't set
my expectations too high.

12:47.589 --> 12:48.789
Dude...

12:48.824 --> 12:51.525
All I've done is cleared her a drawer,
updated my status,

12:51.560 --> 12:53.294
and bought a few wedding magazines.

12:54.362 --> 12:55.563
But you barely know her.

12:55.597 --> 12:58.232
She's a model, and she likes me.

12:58.266 --> 12:59.366
What are you not seeing?

13:00.368 --> 13:02.203
Yeah, well, you got a point.

13:02.237 --> 13:04.205
Hey, if it doesn't work out,
you mind if I hit on her?

13:06.808 --> 13:08.109
- You think you got it?
- I got it.

13:08.143 --> 13:11.679
Ironically,
I actually do kind of want to be an actress.

13:11.713 --> 13:13.781
Just find him, break up with him,

13:13.815 --> 13:15.950
and try not to mention
the whole dying thing.

13:15.984 --> 13:17.818
He's kind of sensitive about it.

13:17.853 --> 13:19.520
Right. Here is his picture.

13:20.555 --> 13:22.523
Oh my God. Is this him?

13:22.557 --> 13:24.258
I love this guy.

13:24.292 --> 13:26.427
Okay. You actually are a good actress.

13:26.461 --> 13:28.295
No,
I see him in the neighborhood all the time,

13:28.330 --> 13:30.131
and I have a total crush on him.
I've just...

13:30.165 --> 13:32.299
I've never been brave
enough to go up and say hi.

13:32.334 --> 13:36.137
Okay, let's not get all improv-y on me here.

13:36.171 --> 13:39.206
I'm a cat, trapped in a dryer,
playing maracas.

13:39.241 --> 13:40.908
I'm not making this up.

13:40.942 --> 13:42.877
He really is my secret crush.

13:42.911 --> 13:44.879
Really?

13:44.913 --> 13:46.647
Maybe it is fate.

13:46.681 --> 13:50.451
I just can't believe he's dying.
This is so sad.

13:50.485 --> 13:52.653
Yeah, yeah. It sure is.

13:52.687 --> 13:54.722
Now get out there and break his heart.

13:56.258 --> 13:58.225
Oh! Oh! Oh!

13:58.260 --> 13:59.460
Come on, ref!

13:59.494 --> 14:02.363
Why don't you bend over and
use your good eye next time!

14:02.397 --> 14:04.365
- Hey.
- Hi, Robyn.

14:04.399 --> 14:07.168
Please notice that I am currently unarmed.

14:09.204 --> 14:11.939
Canceled I'm just here
to say our weekend away.

14:11.973 --> 14:13.874
He hopes I understand,
and I hope you're happy.

14:14.876 --> 14:16.177
Is it bad if I say I am?

14:16.211 --> 14:18.045
Because I really am.

14:18.079 --> 14:20.080
Robyn, I'm so sorry, but...

14:20.115 --> 14:22.616
I really think Danny and I
are meant to be together.

14:22.651 --> 14:23.817
Whatever.

14:24.786 --> 14:26.820
- That's right, let's go!
- Okay then, so..

14:26.855 --> 14:28.489
I'll see you at work.

14:34.763 --> 14:39.066
So in the end, I learned the difference
between dolphins and porpoises,

14:39.100 --> 14:42.102
but I am definitely not
allowed back into the aquarium.

14:45.207 --> 14:46.941
What?

14:46.975 --> 14:49.043
Why do bad things happen to good people?

14:50.078 --> 14:51.612
It's so unfair.

14:52.814 --> 14:54.848
Good point. Deep thought.

14:54.883 --> 14:56.750
Anyway,
I'm gonna go grab us some beer and pretzels.

14:56.785 --> 14:58.552
No, no, I'll go. Please.

14:58.587 --> 14:59.720
You shouldn't exert yourself.

15:05.493 --> 15:06.627
- Hey, man.
- Oh my...

15:06.661 --> 15:09.129
look, dude, I am so sorry.
I just saw her take off.

15:09.164 --> 15:11.465
Just so you know, it's all right to cry.

15:11.499 --> 15:13.267
Not here, but later.

15:14.269 --> 15:15.970
Dude, she loves me.

15:16.004 --> 15:18.305
She keeps telling me how much she's gonna
miss me, and she's just getting pretzels.

15:20.075 --> 15:22.109
Can no one follow directions? Go

15:22.143 --> 15:24.778
forget to tell her I want light beer.

15:24.813 --> 15:26.914
You know, now that I'm dating a model,
the pressure's on.

15:30.719 --> 15:33.554
- Oh, hey, is that...
- Whoo! Let's go Rangers!

15:40.228 --> 15:43.297
Hey, how come every time I text Christine,
your pants buzz?

15:44.399 --> 15:46.133
Tucker, I think the real question here is

15:46.167 --> 15:48.035
why are my pants buzzing
every time you text Christine?

15:53.174 --> 15:54.908
Hey! Hey!

15:54.943 --> 15:56.076
There you are.

15:56.111 --> 15:57.778
Man, I have to tell you,

15:57.812 --> 15:58.912
I like the way you work.

15:58.947 --> 16:01.849
In and out, down and dirty.
How'd he take it?

16:01.883 --> 16:03.651
He didn't.

16:03.685 --> 16:06.520
I can't do this. I can't lie to a dying man.

16:07.989 --> 16:11.258
It's easier than lying to the ones that
are gonna stick around for a while.

16:11.293 --> 16:14.194
God only knows when
they're gonna pop up again.

16:17.232 --> 16:20.267
- E -I'm gonna tell him the truth.
- No, no. You can't

16:20.302 --> 16:22.369
see,
he doesn't know that we know he's dying,

16:22.404 --> 16:24.972
and if he knows you know then
he's gonna know that I know,

16:25.006 --> 16:26.240
and you know what happens after that.

16:26.274 --> 16:27.975
You don't wanna know.

16:28.009 --> 16:31.679
Well, can't you just date
him and keep it a secret?

16:31.713 --> 16:33.547
I mean, who knows,
maybe they'll find a cure.

16:34.749 --> 16:37.751
Why not? It is really hard
finding a guy in Manhattan.

16:37.786 --> 16:39.420
Yeah.

16:39.454 --> 16:42.623
Yeah, I've read articles about the plight of
20-something models that can't find dates.

16:45.260 --> 16:47.428
And I'm gonna need that handy back.

16:47.462 --> 16:49.430
<i>Wheeler,
two minutes for high-sticking.</i>

16:50.432 --> 16:52.433
- Riley, hi.
- Hi, I really need to talk to you.

16:52.467 --> 16:53.967
Now?

16:54.002 --> 16:55.102
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

16:55.136 --> 16:56.236
Oh, come on!

16:56.271 --> 16:58.105
If I don't tell you now,
I think I'm gonna explode.

16:58.139 --> 16:59.907
Okay.

16:59.941 --> 17:00.974
Go ahead. I'm ready.

17:01.009 --> 17:02.076
Danny...

17:04.713 --> 17:05.878
I didn't totally get that.

17:06.915 --> 17:09.483
Danny...

17:09.517 --> 17:10.617
One more time.

17:11.886 --> 17:13.619
I think I'm in love with you!

17:13.655 --> 17:16.690
Charge!

17:17.692 --> 17:21.194
Really? Are you sure?

17:21.229 --> 17:24.131
I mean, I don't want to say
anything to change your mind

17:24.165 --> 17:26.233
because, you know,
I like what you're saying.

17:27.502 --> 17:29.903
Riley, I've been in love with you
for as long as I can remember.

17:32.807 --> 17:34.174
I know.

17:34.209 --> 17:36.143
I'm just so glad that
I finally figured out...

17:39.814 --> 17:41.715
Wait, what do you mean you know?

17:43.618 --> 17:45.719
Well, last year I...

17:45.754 --> 17:47.454
Heard that voice mail
that you accidentally left

17:47.489 --> 17:49.456
saying that you'd been in love
with me for your whole life...

17:49.491 --> 17:51.592
- Wheeler, let's go!
- Okay, okay, I really think they need you.

17:51.626 --> 17:52.659
You knew?

17:52.694 --> 17:54.628
You knew all this time and
you didn't say anything?

17:54.662 --> 17:56.430
Danny, I didn't know what to say.

17:56.464 --> 17:59.400
So you just left me hanging
out there like an idiot?

17:59.434 --> 18:02.035
- Did my feelings mean that little to you?
- Wheeler, come on!

18:02.070 --> 18:04.138
Okay! I'm coming!

18:04.172 --> 18:05.305
No, no, no, no, no.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.207
Danny! Danny! Wait, Danny!

18:14.649 --> 18:16.016
Bad news, I think Tucker's on to us.

18:16.050 --> 18:19.887
Doesn't matter. Christine likes him
and is willing to keep our secret.

18:19.921 --> 18:21.588
What do you mean, you're not dying?

18:21.623 --> 18:23.657
What do you mean,
you got paid to go out with me?

18:23.691 --> 18:26.260
- You're pathetic.
- Well, you're a prostitute.

18:26.294 --> 18:27.594
I'm a model!

18:33.368 --> 18:35.102
What is wrong with you two?

18:35.136 --> 18:38.172
Am I that much of a loser that you
had to pay a girl to go out with me,

18:38.206 --> 18:39.807
and tell her I'm dying?

18:39.841 --> 18:41.842
Well, that was our jumping off point.

18:43.077 --> 18:44.912
Yeah, but you're the one
who just ruined your chances

18:44.946 --> 18:46.046
with the best girl you've ever met.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.648
Yeah, Tucker.

18:47.682 --> 18:49.683
It turns out she actually liked you

18:49.717 --> 18:51.685
before we even talked to her.

18:51.719 --> 18:52.686
So she might be crazy.

18:53.688 --> 18:54.855
Oh my God. It really was fate.

18:55.857 --> 18:57.691
What have I done?

18:57.725 --> 18:59.293
Girl, where you at?

19:00.695 --> 19:02.396
Danny, come on. It's not like that.

19:02.430 --> 19:04.465
- Do you mind?
- Not like what?

19:04.499 --> 19:06.300
Hey, I've got Danny in my back pocket,

19:06.334 --> 19:08.469
so how about I wait and see if
things work out with Ben first?

19:08.503 --> 19:10.204
That's not true.

19:10.238 --> 19:11.405
I didn't know how I felt.

19:11.439 --> 19:13.106
And you do now?

19:13.141 --> 19:14.441
How convenient.

19:14.476 --> 19:18.078
I can't even begin to tell you
how many times you broke my heart.

19:18.112 --> 19:19.880
Get off me!

19:19.914 --> 19:21.081
I'm here now!

19:21.115 --> 19:22.850
That has to count for something.

19:22.884 --> 19:23.984
It doesn't.

19:24.018 --> 19:25.819
Danny, I didn't mean to hurt you.

19:25.854 --> 19:28.822
Well, the girl I loved my whole life
never would have treated me this way.

19:28.857 --> 19:29.890
I don't even know who you are.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.660
Danny! Danny!

19:35.630 --> 19:37.631
You're fine. Nothing to worry about.

19:40.335 --> 19:41.635
Danny, Danny, I'm so sorry.

19:41.669 --> 19:43.303
Can we please talk about this?

19:43.338 --> 19:44.538
Honestly,

19:44.572 --> 19:46.540
there's nothing we need
to talk about anymore.

19:46.574 --> 19:48.475
Besides, I'm running a little late.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.310
Ready for our weekend, babe?

19:50.345 --> 19:51.512
Yeah, I'm ready.

19:51.546 --> 19:53.580
Just need to change.

19:53.615 --> 19:55.516
Bye, Riley. See you around.

20:06.275 --> 20:08.514
She totally liked me, and I blew it.

20:10.795 --> 20:13.697
You guys have no idea how lucky
you are that you found love.

20:19.670 --> 20:21.872
Oh my God, Tucker?

20:21.906 --> 20:23.740
Christine, you found me.

20:23.774 --> 20:25.675
I knew you couldn't stay mad at me forever.

20:25.710 --> 20:27.611
Actually, I'm here to pick up Dylan.

20:27.645 --> 20:28.879
His mom's my best friend.

20:28.913 --> 20:30.714
Oh...

20:30.748 --> 20:32.849
Emma's my best friend's kid.

20:32.884 --> 20:34.551
Wait, so you're really not here to see me?

20:34.585 --> 20:35.952

20:41.559 --> 20:42.826

20:42.860 --> 20:44.961
