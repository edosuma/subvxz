00:50.320 --> 00:54.760
Beneath the Yucatan Peninsula
of Mexico...

00:56.280 --> 00:58.760
...lies another world.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.040
A labyrinth of caves...

01:08.040 --> 01:11.760
...carved by freshwater...

01:18.040 --> 01:21.640
...and essential for life on Earth.

01:48.040 --> 01:53.840
Freshwater shapes the land
and the creatures that live in it...

01:56.040 --> 01:58.680
...in the most surprising ways.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.680
The rainforest of Costa Rica.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.520
As you might expect,
it rains most days.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.760
But it's only during the wet season

02:28.760 --> 02:32.040
that the rains become torrential.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.240
And with them...

02:43.240 --> 02:46.280
...comes a most remarkable creature.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.480
Gliding tree frogs.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.680
Thousands drop in...

03:16.040 --> 03:20.040
...to gather at this
newly-formed pond.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.440
They all have an urgent need.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.040
To breed.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.760
This female needs to find a leaf

03:54.760 --> 03:56.960
and lay her eggs.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.040
The breeding frenzy
will only last one day...

04:07.040 --> 04:10.040
...so she needs to get a move on.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.280
There are lots of eager males.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.680
Nine for every female.

04:30.520 --> 04:35.200
And all are ready to
spring into action.

04:40.760 --> 04:45.040
So, for her, getting
a partner is no problem.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.760
But the other males are desperate.

05:18.320 --> 05:22.760
For this female,
mating is rather chaotic.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.760
Things are getting out of hand.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.440
There is one way to deal with this.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.080
A few well-placed kicks...

06:00.040 --> 06:02.040
...usually does the job.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.280
Problem solved.

06:20.520 --> 06:24.520
She and her partner can now
finally mate...

06:26.040 --> 06:28.040
...in relative peace.

06:58.520 --> 07:02.040
The eggs are positioned perfectly...

07:02.040 --> 07:05.040
...directly overhanging the pond.

07:23.480 --> 07:28.280
This is the ideal nursery
for tadpoles.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.760
For now, her work here is done.

07:35.760 --> 07:40.040
She'll be back next year
when the heavy rains return.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.040
As quickly as freshwater appears...

07:49.520 --> 07:51.360
...it can vanish.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.800
Southeast Sri Lanka.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.520
It's the middle of the dry season.

08:28.040 --> 08:33.040
This is the only remaining
water hole for miles around.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.040
Mugger crocodiles -

09:34.040 --> 09:37.520
giants, five metres long.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.760
Dozens are hiding...

09:43.760 --> 09:46.040
...beneath the surface.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.840
And others...

09:56.840 --> 09:58.760
...are on their way.

10:16.760 --> 10:20.040
This male has been
travelling for hours.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.360
The water hole is the only place
where he has a chance

10:30.360 --> 10:32.120
to catch a deer.

10:43.680 --> 10:49.040
A single adult would be enough to
feed him for the entire dry season.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.120
But hunting prey that
knows you're here...

11:04.120 --> 11:07.280
...requires something
truly remarkable.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.040
He creates...

11:28.040 --> 11:29.760
...a trap.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.760
He digs down into the mud...

11:56.040 --> 11:59.760
...deep enough to hide
beneath the vegetation.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.680
Perfect camouflage.

12:31.040 --> 12:35.040
He has built his trap
right on the water's edge...

12:36.760 --> 12:41.360
...so it's the first place that
thirsty deer will come to drink.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.280
These crocodiles
have learned to exploit

14:40.280 --> 14:43.520
the deer's desperate need
for freshwater.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.520
Freshwater transforms not only
the lives of animals...

15:02.280 --> 15:04.760
...but entire landscapes.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.040
Every year,
over a trillion litres of water

15:21.040 --> 15:24.040
flow into the Kalahari Desert.

15:32.360 --> 15:37.040
It has travelled a thousand miles
from where it fell as rain.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.160
And on arrival...

15:46.040 --> 15:48.880
...it turns the Kalahari...

15:48.880 --> 15:52.040
...into a vast oasis.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.360
The Okavango Delta.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.520
These waters attract
millions of animals.

16:38.280 --> 16:44.040
And for some, now is
the perfect time to raise a family.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.120
A lily-trotter.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.040
And he is a father...

17:08.040 --> 17:09.760
...on duty.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.880
He has not just one...

17:32.640 --> 17:36.440
...but four newly-hatched chicks.

17:52.040 --> 17:56.520
They won't be able to fly
for another six weeks...

17:59.480 --> 18:04.040
...so, until then, he alone
is their protector.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.760
Walking on water
is not straightforward...

18:17.520 --> 18:22.240
...so he must show them how
to be a lily-trotter.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.520
The floodwaters make the perfect
training ground.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.040
And in two weeks...

19:07.280 --> 19:10.760
...his chicks not only
double in size...

19:11.760 --> 19:14.360
...they grow in confidence.

19:26.040 --> 19:30.040
But this is a dangerous place
to stray.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.480
He sounds the alarm,

19:41.480 --> 19:44.760
and his chicks instantly freeze.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.360
They can't yet fly to safety.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.760
But there is one thing
he can do to protect them.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.280
And it's risky.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.280
Get close enough to distract...

20:07.520 --> 20:10.280
...and hopefully divert
the crocodile.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
Mission accomplished.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.040
He signals the all clear.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.520
But one chick is missing.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.520
His calls...

21:41.520 --> 21:43.520
...go unanswered.

22:37.040 --> 22:40.680
A little bedraggled
but alive and well.

22:46.880 --> 22:50.280
His chick just hadn't heard
his call.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.920
And when danger threatens,

22:53.920 --> 22:57.280
its always better
to be safe than sorry.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.560
He's brought his chicks,
all four of them,

23:28.560 --> 23:31.280
to the verge of independence.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.760
Whilst lily-trotters
are well adapted

23:47.760 --> 23:50.200
to life in this flooded world...

23:53.240 --> 23:57.200
...these residents of the delta
are not.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.040
African painted dogs.

24:14.280 --> 24:18.040
Normally, they are remarkably
successful hunters.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.360
But this pack of five
hasn't eaten in days.

24:29.040 --> 24:32.360
Finding prey isn't the problem.

24:39.280 --> 24:43.760
This herd of lechwe is only
a few hundred metres away.

24:48.520 --> 24:52.040
But between them is deep water.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.760
It's not safe to cross here.

27:16.520 --> 27:21.280
On dry land,
the dogs can run at over 40mph.

27:27.520 --> 27:32.520
But when threatened, lechwe always
seek the safety of water.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.640
With their splayed hooves
and long hind legs,

27:41.640 --> 27:44.280
they can power their way
through the water.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.400
The dogs can't.

28:12.040 --> 28:16.320
The pack won't be able
to outswim the lechwe.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.760
But they do have a strategy.

28:42.760 --> 28:47.040
The dogs drive the lechwe to
where they have the advantage.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.480
Back towards dry land.

28:59.280 --> 29:03.040
Now the pack can regain lost ground.

29:50.640 --> 29:56.040
Success today, but tomorrow
the pack will need to hunt again.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.480
In the Okavango,

30:01.480 --> 30:07.040
animals must always adapt to the
coming and going of freshwater.

30:11.760 --> 30:16.760
But there are a few rare places,
as here in Lake Malawi,

30:16.760 --> 30:20.760
where freshwater has lain
for millions of years.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.520
And that has enabled life to evolve

30:26.520 --> 30:30.760
into a dazzling diversity
of species.

30:37.440 --> 30:41.040
There are over a thousand
different kinds of fish here...

30:42.280 --> 30:45.040
...more than any other lake on Earth.

30:56.040 --> 31:00.280
Competition in these waters
is intense.

31:22.920 --> 31:27.280
Meet Nimbochromis livingstonii.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.800
A master of deception

31:32.800 --> 31:37.040
that tricks other fish
into thinking it's dead.

31:41.040 --> 31:45.520
Its mottled colouration
mimics decaying flesh.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.920
But to appear dead...

31:57.040 --> 31:58.920
...one must at least...

31:59.920 --> 32:01.960
...act dead.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.680
This juvenile is fooling no-one.

32:13.840 --> 32:18.040
Perhaps faking his death
will be more believable.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.680
Blown it.

32:56.040 --> 32:59.040
A more subtle performance
will be needed.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.880
This is more convincing.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.280
But his aim must be better
than that.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.200
Nearly.

33:46.760 --> 33:49.600
It seems he's overstayed
his welcome.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.880
In a final effort...

34:24.880 --> 34:28.280
...he appears to even
hold his breath.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.520
Success at last.

35:11.280 --> 35:15.520
All it took was a million years
of evolution...

35:24.280 --> 35:29.040
...and the unique stability
of this ancient lake.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.680
Off the western coast
of Equatorial Africa

35:41.680 --> 35:45.760
lies the volcanic island of Bioko.

35:56.040 --> 36:00.360
Freshwater here has
a turbulent nature.

36:36.040 --> 36:39.520
Few venture into such waters,

36:39.520 --> 36:44.040
but for those that do,
there can be great rewards.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.200
After months feeding and growing
out at sea,

36:50.200 --> 36:53.280
these gobies are ready to breed.

36:56.520 --> 36:59.680
And the safest place
to lay their eggs

36:59.680 --> 37:03.520
is somewhere that
ocean predators can't reach.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.520
The top of this waterfall.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.760
Surely an impossible journey
for a fish.

37:21.760 --> 37:27.160
But over the coming days,
the gobies transform themselves.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.120
They change colour.

37:37.040 --> 37:43.040
Their mouth rotates and acts
like a kind of suction cup...

37:44.520 --> 37:47.040
...which they will certainly need.

37:52.520 --> 37:56.560
Because the only way... is up.

38:17.760 --> 38:21.040
It is 30 metres to the top.

38:27.520 --> 38:31.080
They are only an inch long.

38:34.040 --> 38:38.520
This is the equivalent of
a human being scaling a waterfall

38:38.520 --> 38:40.520
over a mile high.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.760
Millions attempt the climb...

38:54.040 --> 38:57.680
...but less than 1% will make it.

39:07.280 --> 39:10.840
This goby has been
climbing for days.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.000
Made it!

39:25.360 --> 39:29.760
Those that reach the top
can now prepare to breed.

39:33.040 --> 39:38.280
And when the time comes, their young
will be washed back out to sea.

39:59.280 --> 40:02.040
The extraordinary power
of flowing water

40:02.040 --> 40:05.520
makes it our planet's
greatest architect.

40:26.040 --> 40:30.520
This may look like the surface
of an alien planet...

40:43.520 --> 40:49.200
...but these strange patterns
are channels of freshwater...

40:51.360 --> 40:53.760
...flowing towards the sea.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.040
For 3.8 billion years,

41:11.040 --> 41:13.920
ever since the first rains fell...

41:15.280 --> 41:18.680
...freshwater has been
making this journey.

41:34.280 --> 41:39.040
But today, two thirds
of our world's great rivers

41:39.040 --> 41:41.680
no longer reach the sea.

42:14.040 --> 42:18.280
There is a finite amount
of freshwater on Earth...

42:30.520 --> 42:34.360
...so humans have devised
extraordinary means

42:34.360 --> 42:40.040
to ensure that it is always
available to meet our every demand.

42:50.320 --> 42:53.520
We now control freshwater...

42:55.040 --> 42:57.280
...on a colossal scale.

43:02.040 --> 43:05.040
The largest irrigation system
on Earth

43:05.040 --> 43:08.440
has been built here in Pakistan.

43:17.520 --> 43:21.360
A vast network of dams and canals...

43:24.040 --> 43:28.520
...that diverts and drains
the great Indus River.

43:34.520 --> 43:39.280
It's used to irrigate an area
the size of England.

43:44.040 --> 43:46.880
This man-made freshwater world

43:46.880 --> 43:49.760
provides water and a livelihood

43:49.760 --> 43:52.000
for millions of people...

43:59.960 --> 44:03.760
...but at a cost
to the natural world.

44:16.520 --> 44:22.040
A rare creature has become stranded
in this irrigation canal.

44:25.520 --> 44:28.480
And the water will soon be gone,

44:28.480 --> 44:32.040
used to supply the surrounding land.

44:38.280 --> 44:43.280
Endangered, they number fewer
than 2,000 individuals.

44:48.760 --> 44:51.360
An Indus river dolphin.

45:05.280 --> 45:11.040
This female dolphin is 150 miles
from the main river.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.400
She can't return on her own,

45:17.400 --> 45:22.520
so the only option is for
this rescue team to take her.

45:46.520 --> 45:50.360
Out of water,
she cannot survive for long.

45:57.040 --> 46:00.440
The journey back to the river
will take hours.

46:10.040 --> 46:14.760
Her life now depends
on these people.

48:05.760 --> 48:11.560
Nearly 30 dolphins had to be
rescued in one month alone.

48:41.760 --> 48:46.280
Freshwater is not only
a resource for humans.

48:52.280 --> 48:57.040
It is the home for
countless species

48:57.040 --> 49:02.200
that simply cannot survive
without it.

49:21.040 --> 49:24.800
Freshwater is the lifeblood

49:24.800 --> 49:27.280
of Planet Earth.

49:49.040 --> 49:53.520
To film the story of the most
endangered freshwater dolphin,

49:53.520 --> 49:58.280
the Planet Earth team joined the
world's leading expert - Uzma Khan.

49:58.280 --> 50:02.520
The first time I saw Indus dolphin,
I was just amazed.

50:02.520 --> 50:04.520
It's a beautiful creature, you know,

50:04.520 --> 50:07.240
it's like love at first sight.
It's so unique.

50:08.760 --> 50:12.760
Uzma has been studying
the last remaining population

50:12.760 --> 50:14.760
for over 20 years.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.960
There's a dolphin that surfaced
just right there.

50:19.960 --> 50:24.560
Indus river dolphin
can only live in freshwater.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.760
It is only found in Pakistan
and nowhere else.

50:27.760 --> 50:32.040
And we only have about 2,000
of them left in the Indus River.

50:32.040 --> 50:36.240
So, you know, each individual
is special.

50:38.320 --> 50:43.320
Following the dolphins in the murky
water is extremely challenging.

50:44.320 --> 50:47.320
They only surface for a split second

50:47.320 --> 50:51.040
and that makes protecting them
difficult, too.

50:51.040 --> 50:57.040
Their greatest threat is becoming
trapped in the irrigation canals.

50:58.040 --> 51:00.800
But Uzma may have a solution,

51:00.800 --> 51:04.040
and teams up with a rescue unit...

51:05.040 --> 51:08.720
...to attempt something
never done before.

51:11.080 --> 51:14.040
This is the first time
we'll be putting satellite tags

51:14.040 --> 51:16.040
on river dolphins in Asia.

51:16.040 --> 51:19.040
Sensors has not been tested
on this species,

51:19.040 --> 51:22.360
there's a little bit of anxiety,
but if they work,

51:22.360 --> 51:25.360
then it's going to be a breakthrough
for conservation.

51:28.400 --> 51:33.400
Uzma has been developing
a suitable tag for over ten years

51:33.400 --> 51:37.520
and hopes it will help her
collect critical data

51:37.520 --> 51:41.040
on how the dolphins are moving
through the dams and canals.

51:42.280 --> 51:47.280
But in order to tag, she will
first need a successful rescue.

51:57.040 --> 52:01.600
I'm usually very concerned
when a rescue is happening.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.040
You know, the divers,
they are very experienced,

52:14.040 --> 52:16.840
but a part of me is always
very worried.

52:18.280 --> 52:21.520
They are wild animals
that have never been handled.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.520
It's really quite a risky thing
that they're undertaking here.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.760
There's a good chance
the dolphin might die.

52:28.760 --> 52:31.520
But, of course, they're balancing
that against the fact

52:31.520 --> 52:34.040
that they definitely will die
if they stay in here,

52:34.040 --> 52:36.040
so it's a risk they have to take.

52:52.280 --> 52:55.200
Have they got the dolphin?
Yeah, I think so. They've got it.

52:58.520 --> 53:01.280
Now speed is key.

53:10.520 --> 53:14.000
We're now bombing across the field
on the way to the release site,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.520
and I think Uzma went ahead of us,
so I'm really hopeful

53:16.520 --> 53:19.040
that she'll get her opportunity
to tag the dolphin.

53:22.760 --> 53:27.040
But rescue missions
don't always go to plan.

53:37.360 --> 53:39.040
A puncture.

53:46.520 --> 53:50.520
The dolphin is quickly moved
to the film crew's truck.

54:11.400 --> 54:14.040
But with no roof for shelter,

54:14.040 --> 54:17.760
the dolphin is at greater risk
of dehydration.

54:17.760 --> 54:20.360
The stakes are high, even right now.

54:21.360 --> 54:24.040
It's a cute little animal
and we don't want it to die.

54:29.440 --> 54:33.120
The team re-route
to the closest release site.

54:35.280 --> 54:37.360
There can be no more delay.

54:38.520 --> 54:41.000
Uzma calls off the tagging.

54:59.520 --> 55:02.200
It's unfortunate
because we were all prepared,

55:02.200 --> 55:05.280
we were very excited since morning,
all geared up,

55:05.280 --> 55:10.040
but hopefully we'll get an
opportunity to tag the next rescue.

55:20.760 --> 55:25.280
A few days later,
Uzma finally gets her chance.

55:31.320 --> 55:34.360
It's a very exciting day for us.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.280
It's OK.

55:36.280 --> 55:40.240
The moment that we have been
waiting for, over ten years.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.120
Just stay calm.

55:48.240 --> 55:50.280
OK, it's good to go.

55:54.120 --> 55:56.360
Congratulations.

55:56.360 --> 55:58.440
Well done.

56:02.760 --> 56:06.320
I am very happy, very happy.

56:06.320 --> 56:08.880
I think it's a great accomplishment.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.760
It's the happiest moment of my life.

56:20.520 --> 56:26.280
Within a few weeks, the tags begin
to reveal some new insights.

56:28.280 --> 56:32.120
They are moving quite a lot,
which we never expected.

56:32.120 --> 56:37.280
So one of the dolphins actually
went about 46km upstream

56:37.280 --> 56:40.840
from the release site, and the
other thing is that we thought

56:40.840 --> 56:43.280
that they will stay
in the main river stream,

56:43.280 --> 56:47.280
but they are using side channels.
It is extremely interesting.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.240
Tracking the movement
of the tagged dolphins

56:51.240 --> 56:53.520
will help Uzma better understand

56:53.520 --> 56:56.520
when and where
they become trapped...

56:57.760 --> 57:02.760
...helping safeguard the future
of this most endangered animal.

57:08.760 --> 57:10.520
Next time...

57:11.640 --> 57:13.240
...forests.

57:14.840 --> 57:17.080
A hidden world...

57:19.000 --> 57:22.520
...where lives are
intimately entwined...

57:24.360 --> 57:27.360
...in the most unexpected ways.
