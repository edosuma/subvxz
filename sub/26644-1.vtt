01:04.887 --> 01:06.653
Karen?

01:28.043 --> 01:29.044
Karen?

01:30.245 --> 01:31.512
Karen?

01:33.782 --> 01:35.014
Hey, Karen, come on.

01:35.016 --> 01:37.216
What, dad?

01:37.218 --> 01:39.687
Can you just talk to me
for a minute?

01:44.292 --> 01:46.558
How is, uh, how is school going?

01:46.560 --> 01:49.661
It's great, dad.

01:49.663 --> 01:51.596
Best thing ever.

01:51.598 --> 01:53.999
Okay.

01:54.001 --> 01:55.903
Um, how'd that paper turn out?

01:57.571 --> 02:00.072
What paper?
What are you talking about?

02:00.074 --> 02:03.141
Uh, the one you wrote
with the, the painter lady.

02:03.143 --> 02:04.943
- You mean, Emily Dickinson?
- Yeah.

02:04.945 --> 02:08.812
Yeah. She's a poet, dad,
not a painter.

02:08.815 --> 02:11.083
That was, like, three weeks ago.

02:11.085 --> 02:12.783
Do you think I could read it?

02:12.785 --> 02:15.253
What? No, dad, that's weird.

02:23.297 --> 02:25.129
You don't wear that necklace
I got you.

02:25.131 --> 02:26.666
I-I thought you liked it.

02:31.871 --> 02:33.570
I know you're upset.

02:33.572 --> 02:35.272
I'm not upset, dad.

02:35.274 --> 02:38.111
It's horseback riding,
not a trip to Paris.

02:39.745 --> 02:41.611
I'm gonna make it up to you.

02:41.613 --> 02:43.216
I said I'm not upset, okay?

02:44.150 --> 02:45.349
I don't even care.

02:49.288 --> 02:51.355
- Dad?
- Uh, i-it's, it's fine.

02:51.357 --> 02:52.824
It'll-it'll be fine.

03:04.002 --> 03:06.036
Oh, shit.

03:06.038 --> 03:07.305
Hey, honey?

03:13.211 --> 03:14.279
Karen?

03:16.048 --> 03:18.883
Hey, hon? Karen?

03:21.353 --> 03:23.719
- Karen!
- What, dad?

03:23.721 --> 03:24.987
There should be some old rags
in the trunk.

03:24.989 --> 03:26.724
Could you grab me one, please?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.166
Thanks, kiddo.

03:37.168 --> 03:38.200
Karen!

03:38.202 --> 03:40.635
Dad! What the hell?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.971
That cell phone!
You could've been killed!

03:42.973 --> 03:45.174
What are you talking about?

03:45.176 --> 03:46.243
God.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.152
So how long
until the car is fixed?

03:58.154 --> 03:59.887
Oh, the guy from the garage said
it won't be done

03:59.889 --> 04:00.988
till the end of the day.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.223
Great.

04:02.225 --> 04:04.092
We'll find something else to do.

04:04.094 --> 04:06.861
- It's not a big deal.
- No, it is a big deal.

04:06.863 --> 04:08.896
We only get one weekend
out of the months together

04:08.898 --> 04:11.568
and I'm, like, striking out
all over the place here.

04:13.303 --> 04:16.337
What's there to do around here?

04:16.339 --> 04:19.075
Um... Well, let's take a look.

04:21.377 --> 04:23.877
Okay, we've got...

04:23.879 --> 04:27.848
Oh, we've got bowling,
we've got, oh, mini-golf.

04:27.850 --> 04:31.084
That sounds like a lot of...

04:31.086 --> 04:34.121
N-no fun at all.

04:34.123 --> 04:37.424
We have movies,
we have kids' theater...

04:37.426 --> 04:40.360
Wait. Wait a second.

04:40.362 --> 04:44.064
What about this? Escape Rooms.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.365
You've been talking
about these things, right?

04:45.367 --> 04:47.334
You said you wanted to try one.

04:47.336 --> 04:51.004
Nicole and some friends
did one a while back.

04:51.006 --> 04:53.373
Sounded cool.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.774
Well, okay.
I'm on board with cool.

04:55.776 --> 04:58.911
Dad, that one
was in San Francisco.

04:58.913 --> 05:02.047
Out here, wherever we are,

05:02.049 --> 05:05.951
it's probably in some
creepy guy's garage or worse.

05:05.953 --> 05:08.754
Well, we won't know
until we try, will we?

05:08.756 --> 05:11.425
Hm? Huh?

05:13.094 --> 05:16.362
Uh, excuse me.

05:16.364 --> 05:19.098
- We doing all right over here?
- Uh, yeah.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.100
We're great. Thank you.

05:21.102 --> 05:23.735
We were just wondering...

05:23.737 --> 05:25.772
how do we get to this place?

05:28.176 --> 05:30.111
You don't go to that place.

05:31.345 --> 05:32.877
Why not?

05:32.879 --> 05:35.947
That place...

05:35.949 --> 05:39.317
A lot of bad things have
happened there over the years.

05:39.319 --> 05:40.854
What do you mean?

05:43.290 --> 05:45.190
I can't really say.

05:45.192 --> 05:49.160
Just...
You hear a lot of stories.

05:49.162 --> 05:51.396
Stuff that don't make
much sense.

05:51.398 --> 05:55.433
All I know is,
a lot of people go up there

05:55.435 --> 05:58.205
and you never
hear from them again.

06:04.877 --> 06:06.910
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:06.912 --> 06:09.079
Oh, I can never keep
a straight face.

06:09.081 --> 06:10.814
I'm just messing with you.

06:10.816 --> 06:13.116
No, you take it from me,
you go up there,

06:13.118 --> 06:16.420
you're gonna have
one hell of a time.

06:16.422 --> 06:18.457
Just tell 'em Betsy sent you.

06:19.858 --> 06:22.795
Okay, now we have to go.

06:24.897 --> 06:26.098
For Betsy.

06:27.233 --> 06:29.235
Fine.

06:39.010 --> 06:42.044
<i>Wow, that's so cute.</i>

06:42.046 --> 06:44.115
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

08:18.173 --> 08:19.274
Sorry.

08:30.653 --> 08:32.150
Karen, let's go.

08:32.153 --> 08:35.190
Seriously?
Just give me a minute.

08:42.197 --> 08:44.364
- What exactly is an escape room?
- It's a game, dad.

08:44.366 --> 08:46.666
They just, like, lock
you up in a room, and that's it?

08:46.668 --> 08:48.501
No, they give you
clues to solve

08:48.503 --> 08:50.470
and then you try to figure out
how to escape.

08:50.472 --> 08:51.606
Oh.

08:56.511 --> 08:58.977
You ready?

08:58.979 --> 09:00.112
Yeah.

09:04.218 --> 09:06.551
Why didn't you just have them
pull up to the door?

09:06.553 --> 09:09.354
It's more money. Plus, cardio.

09:09.356 --> 09:10.989
Oh, my God.

09:15.362 --> 09:17.061
So this is the place?

09:17.063 --> 09:19.096
Yeah, it has to be.

09:19.098 --> 09:20.501
Looks really popular.

09:24.270 --> 09:25.938
- Come on.
- Mm...

09:39.285 --> 09:40.353
Hello?

09:43.256 --> 09:45.423
Maybe it's closed.

09:45.425 --> 09:48.125
Maybe I didn't...

09:54.300 --> 09:55.501
Hello?

10:01.206 --> 10:02.340
Anyone here?

10:15.153 --> 10:19.491
We're, uh... here to escape,
I guess.

10:21.793 --> 10:24.260
Hey, hon?

10:24.262 --> 10:27.229
- Stay close.
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.231 --> 10:29.131
How did you get in here?
What do you want?

10:29.133 --> 10:31.468
Hey, what the hell?
What are you talking about?

10:31.470 --> 10:35.504
It's you. Thank God you came.

10:35.506 --> 10:39.041
It's me, Josie.
Surely you remember me.

10:39.043 --> 10:40.609
Please hurry.
The others are waiting.

10:40.611 --> 10:42.246
We haven't much time.

10:46.283 --> 10:47.551
She's pretty good.

10:48.819 --> 10:49.987
Yeah.

11:03.434 --> 11:05.099
- Hey. Melanie.
- Hi.

11:05.101 --> 11:07.168
Uh, this is Tyler.

11:07.170 --> 11:10.104
- First time?
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm Michael.

11:10.106 --> 11:11.740
This is my daughter, Karen.

11:11.742 --> 11:13.407
Is this your first time?

11:13.409 --> 11:15.209
No, I've done these before.

11:15.211 --> 11:18.379
He only let me drag him along
because it's my birthday.

11:18.381 --> 11:19.749
Happy birthday.

11:21.718 --> 11:24.085
How about you?
Are you here alone?

11:24.087 --> 11:26.487
No, well, I'm a plant.

11:26.489 --> 11:29.089
I'm with the Escape Room.

11:29.091 --> 11:30.491
Really?

11:30.493 --> 11:32.727
No. Why would I tell you that?

11:35.130 --> 11:37.732
Apologies. I don't have
much more to give you.

11:37.734 --> 11:40.635
I rarely get visitors anymore.

11:40.637 --> 11:44.406
Few have dared to come
since the disappearances.

11:56.251 --> 11:57.851
For you.

11:57.853 --> 11:59.354
Thank you.

12:01.890 --> 12:04.259
Oh. Thank you.

12:05.694 --> 12:09.194
I don't know
why you look so confused.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.463
Perhaps this will help
to clear your mind

12:11.465 --> 12:13.635
and prepare you
for what is to come.

12:16.337 --> 12:17.503
- No, no, don't.
- Dad...

12:17.505 --> 12:19.204
We don't even know
what's in this.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.709
- Chai tea. Not bad.
- And what?

12:23.711 --> 12:25.878
I've taken the liberty
of drawing up contracts

12:25.880 --> 12:27.580
for each of you.

12:27.582 --> 12:30.716
Apologies if it seems unusual.

12:30.718 --> 12:34.486
But the authorities
will require some proof

12:34.488 --> 12:36.589
that you are
willing participants

12:36.591 --> 12:39.660
in case anything should happen
to you.

12:41.629 --> 12:42.697
Oh.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.199
What is this?

12:48.201 --> 12:50.703
It's a waiver. Pretty customary.

12:50.705 --> 12:53.340
Just a little dressed up
for the occasion.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.613
- Your contraptions, miss.
- My what?

13:01.615 --> 13:03.514
I don't mean
to cast dispersions,

13:03.516 --> 13:06.818
but some have tried to smuggle
in their devices

13:06.820 --> 13:09.854
in order to record
what they see inside the house

13:09.856 --> 13:14.324
in a misguided attempt to share
its secrets with the world.

13:14.326 --> 13:15.693
That's pretty impressive, Josie,
I can't get her

13:15.695 --> 13:16.828
to shut that thing off

13:16.830 --> 13:18.464
for more than five minutes.

13:26.873 --> 13:29.706
- Excuse me.
- Mm...

13:29.708 --> 13:31.742
- Uh, no. I need this.
- Ty.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.911
There are no gadgets
that can help you in here.

13:34.913 --> 13:38.382
To get out of the house,
you need to rely on your wit

13:38.384 --> 13:39.650
and one another.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.253
- Mm.
- Tyler.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.423
Okay.

13:46.425 --> 13:47.893
There you go, all right?

13:50.796 --> 13:52.865
- Thank you.
- Mwah.

14:18.756 --> 14:20.690
Sometime ago,

14:20.692 --> 14:22.658
strange occurrences
began to plague

14:22.660 --> 14:25.260
the surrounding townships.

14:25.262 --> 14:26.929
People who lived there
claimed to see things

14:26.931 --> 14:30.331
that simply could not be,

14:30.333 --> 14:31.800
things that should've
remained confined

14:31.802 --> 14:34.502
to dreams and nightmares.

14:34.504 --> 14:36.705
The church blamed black magic,

14:36.707 --> 14:38.973
the devil's work.

14:38.975 --> 14:41.476
Doctors feared an outbreak
of some kind,

14:41.478 --> 14:44.412
a disease of the mind.

14:44.414 --> 14:47.348
But it was discovered
that the cause of these events

14:47.350 --> 14:50.652
lie here within these walls.

14:50.654 --> 14:53.688
An inventor lived here,
a recluse,

14:53.690 --> 14:55.557
who came to test theories,

14:55.559 --> 14:59.293
theories that were rejected
by the outside world.

14:59.295 --> 15:01.295
The town sent five people

15:01.297 --> 15:03.865
to put a stop
to the inventor's experiments,

15:03.867 --> 15:06.600
and were never heard from again.

15:06.602 --> 15:09.436
It is your job
to find what happened

15:09.438 --> 15:11.572
to these people who went missing

15:11.574 --> 15:14.475
and help them escape the house.

15:14.477 --> 15:17.077
There will be a key
hidden in each room

15:17.079 --> 15:18.779
to help you along the way.

15:18.781 --> 15:21.749
But you will only have one hour
to complete your task

15:21.751 --> 15:25.451
before the forces lurking
within the house drive you mad.

15:25.453 --> 15:28.021
If at any point
you cannot continue,

15:28.023 --> 15:30.724
simply speak the word, "Awake,"

15:30.726 --> 15:33.361
and you shall be freed
from the house.

15:34.830 --> 15:36.362
But I must warn you,

15:36.364 --> 15:38.598
you may not be prepared
for everything

15:38.600 --> 15:40.268
it has to show you.

16:07.461 --> 16:08.897
Okay, that was weird.

16:26.914 --> 16:28.547
This isn't gonna be
really scary, is it?

16:28.549 --> 16:30.617
No,
this is going to be fun.

16:37.657 --> 16:40.457
It's locked.

16:40.459 --> 16:43.763
So what do we do now?

16:46.133 --> 16:47.898
We play.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.700
Stop standing around
and start looking for clues.

16:49.702 --> 16:51.569
Okay.

16:51.571 --> 16:53.470
What exactly
does a clue look like?

16:53.472 --> 16:55.973
It could be anything
that looks out of place.

16:55.975 --> 16:57.743
It all looks out of place.

17:13.192 --> 17:16.593
"Aya... Ayawask?"

17:16.595 --> 17:19.029
Close. Ayahuasca.

17:19.031 --> 17:21.830
It's a, um, tea
Shamans used to drink

17:21.833 --> 17:23.933
to speak to the other world.

17:23.935 --> 17:25.569
South-American thing.

17:27.806 --> 17:29.539
- I travel a lot.
- Mm...

17:29.541 --> 17:31.674
South American?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.678
- Yeah.
- Like those masks over there.

17:35.747 --> 17:39.949
- Like those masks.
- This is, uh, this is cool, huh?

17:39.951 --> 17:42.684
I guess, yeah.

17:42.686 --> 17:46.822
So what do you think this, uh,
this inventor was up to here?

17:46.824 --> 17:48.724
Probably inventing.

17:53.898 --> 17:57.200
Find anything yet?
Clues?

17:57.202 --> 17:58.934
Look, can you just assume
you're gonna be here

17:58.936 --> 18:01.503
for the next 60 minutes,
and relax?

18:01.505 --> 18:04.408
- Your e-mails can wait.
- All right.

18:20.623 --> 18:23.158
Mine's a dud.
You got anything good in there?

18:23.160 --> 18:26.861
Uh, yeah. Only
my favorite band of all time.

18:26.863 --> 18:28.562
- Oh, my.
- Mm-hmm.

18:28.564 --> 18:30.531
I've got their Greatest Hits.

18:30.533 --> 18:31.933
- Really?
- No.

18:31.935 --> 18:34.135
They don't have Greatest Hits.

18:34.137 --> 18:37.038
No, no, no, don't put it back.
We gotta listen to it now.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.776
- It could have a clue in it.
- Okay.

18:41.277 --> 18:42.612
Over there.

18:54.756 --> 18:56.823
Here we go.

19:00.896 --> 19:02.595
Okay, I'm sorry,
that's terrible.

19:02.597 --> 19:05.165
Yes, it is.
Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

19:05.167 --> 19:07.534
- What?
- Listen.

19:07.536 --> 19:09.669
No, he's right.

19:09.671 --> 19:12.706
She's singing
about a-a snake and a raven.

19:12.708 --> 19:14.708
Yeah. And so?

19:14.710 --> 19:16.678
Look at the masks.

19:20.182 --> 19:22.250
Okay, babe,
these are out of order.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.621
It has to be snake...

19:31.792 --> 19:32.960
Now raven...

19:37.698 --> 19:42.503
The wolf and... the pig.

19:49.143 --> 19:50.209
Look.

19:50.211 --> 19:51.711
There it is.

19:52.780 --> 19:55.782
Great job, hon. Uh, Karen.

19:57.051 --> 19:59.917
Well, fun's not over yet.

19:59.919 --> 20:01.086
Now we gotta find
the combination.

20:01.088 --> 20:03.021
- Really?
- Tyler.

20:03.023 --> 20:04.722
Uh... Hm.

20:04.724 --> 20:06.791
So we're looking for numbers.

20:06.793 --> 20:10.261
Yeah, but it might be something
that we're supposed to count.

20:10.263 --> 20:13.666
Stuffs that's all
the same color. I don't know.

20:29.615 --> 20:31.550
Whoa. Trippy.

20:59.311 --> 21:01.013
- Melanie!
- Tyler!

21:05.384 --> 21:07.950
- Are you hurt?
- No, no, I'm fine.

21:07.952 --> 21:10.986
- Did nobody else see that?
- See what?

21:10.988 --> 21:12.988
Nice, try, Ty. Not leaving...

21:12.990 --> 21:14.859
No, I'm not trying
to get out...

21:21.032 --> 21:24.635
I think I, uh,
I had too much of that tea.

21:28.206 --> 21:29.671
You're probably right.

21:29.673 --> 21:30.873
These places are designed
to get you

21:30.875 --> 21:32.074
to jump at your own shadows,
man.

21:32.076 --> 21:33.442
I wouldn't worry about it.

21:33.444 --> 21:35.444
To put ideas
in your head and stuff.

21:35.446 --> 21:38.813
- It's probably that movie.
- Mm-hmm. Thanks.

21:38.815 --> 21:40.318
- Mm.
- Babe.

21:43.687 --> 21:45.220
You're not gonna make this like
the haunted mansion last time.

21:45.222 --> 21:47.255
- I mean, are you?
- No, no, no.

21:47.257 --> 21:49.858
You stepped on a bowl of Jell-O
and gummy worms.

21:49.860 --> 21:51.159
Screamed and left
in under ten minutes.

21:51.161 --> 21:52.760
You know, you know,
I don't even wanna

21:52.762 --> 21:55.029
like this crap.

21:55.031 --> 21:57.031
Okay? But I'm here.

21:57.033 --> 21:59.100
Okay? Look, look,
I'm here, right?

21:59.102 --> 22:00.969
I'm here
and we're looking for clues.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.140
Just... Let's just find
the clues, huh?

22:09.146 --> 22:10.247
Hey, guys.

22:12.382 --> 22:13.983
Look at the masks.

22:25.194 --> 22:28.195
Numbers.
Is that the combination?

22:28.197 --> 22:29.365
It's gotta be.

22:32.034 --> 22:33.701
Lift up that mask on the end.

22:37.506 --> 22:40.440
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.109
- You're ready?
- Ready.

22:42.111 --> 22:45.145
- Thirteen.
- Yeah.

22:45.147 --> 22:46.282
Eight.

22:48.184 --> 22:49.218
Seven.

22:51.052 --> 22:52.319
Eighteen.

22:56.057 --> 22:58.124
Boom! Done.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.525
How are we doing now, Melanie?

22:59.527 --> 23:01.861
- Back on track.
- Nice.

23:01.863 --> 23:03.965
- Good job, hon.
- Ah!

23:07.268 --> 23:09.904
Careful.
You might see the boogeyman.

23:25.285 --> 23:26.818
Another room.

23:26.820 --> 23:29.921
I thought it was Escape Room,
not rooms.

23:29.923 --> 23:32.960
Tyler.

23:39.333 --> 23:41.099
Okay, guys, we're looking good.

23:41.101 --> 23:43.168
We still have 50 minutes left.

23:43.170 --> 23:45.237
But we haven't found
anyone yet.

23:45.239 --> 23:47.272
Be patient.

23:47.274 --> 23:50.275
There are a lot of clocks
in this place.

23:50.277 --> 23:51.909
Maybe they have something to do
with what the inventor

23:51.911 --> 23:53.811
was up to?

23:53.813 --> 23:55.212
You know, this, um, ahem,

23:55.214 --> 23:58.282
inventor wasn't a real guy,
right?

23:58.284 --> 23:59.850
Thank you.

23:59.852 --> 24:01.252
Look at you,
getting all into this.

24:02.489 --> 24:04.890
- It's fun, huh?
- Yeah.

24:19.272 --> 24:20.805
Dad, check this out.

24:26.111 --> 24:28.579
It is cool.

24:28.581 --> 24:31.080
How does it do that?

24:32.183 --> 24:33.617
Hey, guys, it's ringing.

24:33.619 --> 24:35.918
Babe, order me a pizza.
I'm getting hungry.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.588
Only if you want
a dead delivery man.

24:37.590 --> 24:40.392
- That's not funny.
- Wait, what do you mean?

24:42.027 --> 24:44.227
Our inventor
was using these devices

24:44.229 --> 24:46.262
to communicate
to the other side.

24:46.264 --> 24:48.631
I'm starting to see
a theme here.

24:48.633 --> 24:50.366
Huh?

24:50.368 --> 24:52.502
It's like the last room.

24:52.504 --> 24:54.936
Our hostess said
that the inventor

24:54.938 --> 24:56.938
was trying to communicate
with the dead.

24:56.940 --> 24:58.974
In the last room
we had the ayahuasca tea.

24:58.976 --> 25:01.977
In this room
we have these devices.

25:01.979 --> 25:05.914
- It's the same thing.
- So is that a clue?

25:05.916 --> 25:07.918
Or just
a really good atmosphere.

25:12.189 --> 25:14.389
- I think I can hear somebody.
- What are they saying?

25:14.391 --> 25:17.125
I'm not sure,
I can barely make it out.

25:17.127 --> 25:18.362
Hello?

25:20.264 --> 25:21.298
Guys.

25:23.567 --> 25:25.035
I can hear somebody.

25:27.638 --> 25:30.639
- Hello?
- <i>Hello?</i>

25:30.641 --> 25:32.909
- It sounds like...
- <i>It sounds like...</i>

25:35.078 --> 25:37.178
It's just a gag,
it's recording my voice

25:37.180 --> 25:39.146
and playing it back to me,
but I don't know...

25:39.148 --> 25:41.315
<i>You don't
know what this means.</i>

25:41.317 --> 25:43.219
<i>You don't know
what any of this means.</i>

25:47.056 --> 25:49.423
- Melanie, what is it?
- Shh!

25:49.425 --> 25:51.394
<i>He's there now,
isn't he?</i>

25:52.962 --> 25:54.597
<i>Let me speak to him?</i>

25:57.300 --> 26:00.634
Um... I think it's for you.

26:00.636 --> 26:02.603
It's my voice, but they're
messing with it or something.

26:02.605 --> 26:05.506
She's asking for you.
Maybe it's a clue?

26:05.508 --> 26:07.610
- No.
- Ty.

26:27.362 --> 26:28.430
Just...

26:36.471 --> 26:38.172
Happy birthday.

26:39.608 --> 26:41.608
- Hello?
- <i>Ty...</i>

26:41.610 --> 26:44.176
<i>Ty, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</i>

26:44.178 --> 26:46.646
- Melanie, this isn't funny.
- That's not me, I swear.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.714
<i>It's not me, Ty.</i>

26:47.716 --> 26:50.249
- <i>It's not me.</i>
- What?

26:50.251 --> 26:51.383
<i>You just have
to get outta there.</i>

26:51.385 --> 26:52.518
- What are you...
- <i>Just run!</i>

26:52.520 --> 26:54.453
- What?
- <i>Ty, just run!</i>

26:54.455 --> 26:55.956
God! Tyler, your ear!

27:00.528 --> 27:02.194
- Tyler!
- It's damn worms!

27:02.196 --> 27:04.229
- Worms in my ears! Shit!
- It's fake blood, Ty.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.998
No. No, no, no.
Get 'em off me. Get 'em, get...

27:07.000 --> 27:08.434
It's just a trick.
It's just a prank.

27:08.436 --> 27:10.636
No, no, no. I, I know!
I know what I saw!

27:10.638 --> 27:13.070
- Ty.
- Okay? Hey, I know what I saw.

27:13.072 --> 27:14.573
- They're just trying to scare...
- Listen. Listen!

27:14.575 --> 27:17.308
- I know what I saw!
- It's not real, Ty.

27:17.310 --> 27:20.144
Okay. No, you know what?
I'm...

27:20.146 --> 27:22.046
I tried.
You know, I'm trying here.

27:22.048 --> 27:24.449
But, like,
I'm not having any fun.

27:24.451 --> 27:26.117
This is great.
You guys are super into it.

27:26.119 --> 27:28.619
But now I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna leave. I'm done.

27:28.621 --> 27:30.488
Can you let me out?
You guys listening?

27:30.490 --> 27:31.756
What's the, what's the, uh...

27:31.758 --> 27:33.324
Aw-aw-awake!

27:33.326 --> 27:35.259
- Ty.
- Okay? Aw-awake.

27:35.261 --> 27:37.361
Awake! Awake!

27:37.363 --> 27:39.564
Ty! Ty!

27:39.566 --> 27:42.700
Ty, it's my birthday!

27:42.702 --> 27:45.368
Ty.

27:45.370 --> 27:48.606
Dammit.
I can't believe he bailed on me.

27:48.608 --> 27:51.107
Maybe they can pause the game
and you can go talk to him.

27:51.109 --> 27:54.444
No, it's fine.
He always does this.

27:54.446 --> 27:56.079
He's all excited to do it
and then

27:56.081 --> 27:57.447
freaks out as soon as it starts
getting difficult.

27:57.449 --> 27:59.783
He looked
pretty shook up to me.

27:59.785 --> 28:01.551
He said he saw worms.

28:01.553 --> 28:03.520
There's no worms.
He's just being dramatic.

28:03.522 --> 28:07.657
Hey, maybe they did spike
that tea.

28:07.659 --> 28:11.228
No. No, that would be against,
like, a dozen laws.

28:11.230 --> 28:14.196
You don't know what you signed
in that waiver. Did you read it?

28:14.198 --> 28:17.299
- Are you guys being serious?
- Did you see that tea?

28:17.301 --> 28:20.069
They're running a business here.
They're not gonna drug us.

28:20.071 --> 28:22.639
He just gets paranoid.
That's all.

28:22.641 --> 28:25.541
Okay. What about the movie
that they showed us?

28:25.543 --> 28:28.277
Maybe there's something in
the subliminal messages of that.

28:28.279 --> 28:31.113
Yeah. Do you know something
you're not telling us?

28:31.115 --> 28:34.683
Yeah. I know all the secrets
of this house.

28:34.685 --> 28:36.218
Yeah. I'm on their payroll.

28:36.220 --> 28:37.253
That's why I'm telling you

28:37.255 --> 28:38.654
all of this right now.

28:38.656 --> 28:41.557
Okay. Come on, really?

28:41.559 --> 28:44.495
Look at the time.
Are we playing or aren't we?

28:48.633 --> 28:49.734
Okay.

29:05.181 --> 29:08.251
So why are you here... alone?

29:09.653 --> 29:12.120
Doctor's suggestions.

29:12.122 --> 29:13.655
Mm.

29:13.657 --> 29:15.857
My shrink seems to think
that I need to do

29:15.859 --> 29:19.494
more character-building
exercises with strangers.

29:19.496 --> 29:23.065
So, uh... how am I doing?

29:25.602 --> 29:27.236
Not great.

29:28.805 --> 29:31.806
Shit. I thought
I was doing pretty good.

29:31.808 --> 29:34.408
Think again, buddy.

29:34.410 --> 29:36.777
Okay, you don't have to get mean
about it.

29:36.779 --> 29:39.615
Hey, guys.
Look at the typewriter.

29:42.618 --> 29:44.353
All the keys are out of order.

29:47.456 --> 29:49.423
That's it. It must be a cypher.

29:49.425 --> 29:50.724
W-we just have to figure out
what we're supposed

29:50.726 --> 29:52.726
to type into this thing.

29:52.728 --> 29:55.862
- Do you see anything?
- Wait.

29:55.864 --> 29:59.332
How long have we been here,
like, in this room?

29:59.334 --> 30:00.803
Uh, five, ten minutes.

30:02.337 --> 30:04.503
So that clock's broken.

30:04.505 --> 30:06.807
The hands haven't moved
since we got here.

30:06.809 --> 30:10.710
They're stuck at...
stuck at 10:12.

30:10.712 --> 30:13.114
- 10:12.
- Wait.

30:15.416 --> 30:17.683
That's genius.

30:17.685 --> 30:20.486
It's a four-digit number.
I mean, who needs Tyler?

30:20.488 --> 30:22.688
You're my new partner.
The radio.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.557
Wait, you think
that the four-digit number

30:24.559 --> 30:26.291
is a radio station?

30:26.293 --> 30:28.561
Yeah.

30:28.563 --> 30:31.664
Hey, tune in to 101...

30:31.666 --> 30:33.766
- Two.
- 101.2.

30:37.337 --> 30:39.839
<i>Z, F.</i>

30:39.841 --> 30:41.673
- We have to type.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

30:41.675 --> 30:44.944
- Z, F...
- <i>K, L...</i>

30:44.946 --> 30:47.445
- <i>B, D...</i>
- D...

30:47.447 --> 30:49.514
- <i>J, U...</i>
- J.

30:49.516 --> 30:50.849
- Good job.
- Thank you.

30:50.851 --> 30:54.619
- <i>Z, H, D, Q...</i>
- Z, H...

30:54.621 --> 30:59.691
- <i>Q, F, W, X...</i>
- Q...

30:59.693 --> 31:03.494
<i>F, A, R, U...</i>

31:03.496 --> 31:05.231
- Top. Top.
- Thank you.

31:08.935 --> 31:13.437
"Five lost from... midnight."

31:13.439 --> 31:15.408
The five missing people?

31:16.842 --> 31:19.743
Maybe
we're just complicating it.

31:19.745 --> 31:21.679
- What do you mean?
- Um...

31:21.681 --> 31:25.015
No, five lost from midnight.

31:52.377 --> 31:53.743
- Nice.
- Okay.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.979
Let's find a door
for your key.

31:56.981 --> 31:58.883
- Take this one first?
- Yeah.

32:00.518 --> 32:03.419
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.889
There's one over here.

32:06.691 --> 32:07.826
Nice.

32:11.428 --> 32:12.795
Nothing?

32:12.797 --> 32:15.330
- Nope.
- Last one.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.808
All right,
what do we have in here?

32:26.443 --> 32:28.009
What is it?

32:28.011 --> 32:29.379
A closet.

32:31.548 --> 32:33.648
Just a closet.

32:33.650 --> 32:37.619
Not just a closet.
Everything in here's on purpose.

32:37.621 --> 32:38.954
It's also just a closet.

32:38.956 --> 32:41.056
No, there's gotta be
something in there.

32:41.058 --> 32:43.725
Yeah, okay. Well, be my guest.
It smells like mothballs there.

32:43.727 --> 32:45.761
No, wait till you get
one of the other doors to open.

32:45.763 --> 32:48.029
Well, how are we supposed to
find anything in all this crap?

32:48.031 --> 32:50.433
Let me see. Check everywhere.

32:56.773 --> 32:58.073
You know what,
I think I feel something.

32:58.075 --> 32:59.640
What is it, Karen?

32:59.642 --> 33:02.777
Um, it's, it's wet.

33:04.347 --> 33:06.413
Whoa-whoa!

33:06.415 --> 33:08.082
Jesus!

33:08.084 --> 33:11.018
Okay. That, yeah, that got me.

33:11.020 --> 33:12.955
- Dad!
- What?

33:16.391 --> 33:18.491
- Help me.
- Help you?

33:18.493 --> 33:21.796
What do you mean, help you?
This is part of the game, right?

33:21.798 --> 33:23.530
- Help me.
- Dad.

33:23.532 --> 33:25.567
Help me.

33:29.038 --> 33:30.939
Okay,
what's happening here?

33:36.545 --> 33:38.547
Oh, this game is awesome.

33:40.448 --> 33:42.749
Oh, my God.
Dad, is she really bleeding?

33:42.751 --> 33:45.819
Hey, guys, um,
I think she's really hurt.

33:45.821 --> 33:47.020
Yeah,
she's bleeding pretty bad.

33:47.022 --> 33:49.122
Oh, yeah, right. Um...

33:49.124 --> 33:52.058
Hey, can you tell us,
um, what happened?

33:52.060 --> 33:53.793
- Who did this to you?
- Knock it off. Okay?

33:53.795 --> 33:56.029
She's not...
She's, she's not...

33:56.031 --> 33:58.430
- She's not what?
- It was...

33:58.432 --> 33:59.464
You guys are gullible.

33:59.466 --> 34:00.701
It was...

34:01.635 --> 34:04.670
the inventor.

34:04.672 --> 34:07.940
- What do you mean?
- The inventor.

34:07.942 --> 34:10.007
He's here...

34:10.010 --> 34:11.911
inside the house.

34:13.547 --> 34:16.148
You'll have to get out
before he turns up

34:16.150 --> 34:17.650
or you'll never...

34:19.552 --> 34:22.987
escape.

34:22.989 --> 34:25.590
Oh, my God. This, this is crazy.
She's delirious.

34:25.592 --> 34:27.125
She's not delirious,
she's reading lines.

34:27.127 --> 34:28.896
Find the master key.

34:34.534 --> 34:36.934
Oh, you guys heard her.
You have to find the master key.

34:36.936 --> 34:39.070
- She's dead.
- Yeah.

34:39.072 --> 34:41.205
I thought she oversold
a little bit, but...

34:41.206 --> 34:42.974
Yeah, we're not getting
anything further out of her,

34:42.976 --> 34:44.208
so we better start looking
for that key.

34:44.210 --> 34:48.079
Are you nuts? Did you see her?

34:48.081 --> 34:51.547
That's make-up and prosthetics.
None of that stuff was real...

34:51.550 --> 34:53.719
Well, if she was fakin' it,
she was doing a hell of a job.

34:56.889 --> 34:59.826
That's it. I'm putting
a stop to this right now.

35:01.693 --> 35:03.995
- Awake!
- What are you doing?

35:03.997 --> 35:05.562
- Awake, damn it!
- What are you doing?

35:05.564 --> 35:06.830
- Awake!
- This is brilliant!

35:06.832 --> 35:08.667
- Why are you ruining it?
- Come on!

35:10.836 --> 35:13.637
- Does this happen?
- Does what happen?

35:13.639 --> 35:15.605
The safe word.
Do they just ignore it?

35:15.607 --> 35:18.508
- Are we trapped in here?
- Tyler got out.

35:18.510 --> 35:20.944
Did he, though?

35:20.946 --> 35:23.046
What are you saying?

35:23.048 --> 35:24.983
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

35:26.752 --> 35:29.052
I don't know, dad.

35:29.054 --> 35:30.753
We didn't see anybody else.

35:30.755 --> 35:33.223
That Josie girl...

35:33.225 --> 35:35.758
maybe she had to go back
to the desk.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.628
Go back to the desk?
In her condition?

35:39.630 --> 35:40.696
So let me get this
straight.

35:40.698 --> 35:43.166
Someone invaded the Escape Room,

35:43.168 --> 35:46.037
killed our hostess
and locked us in.

35:47.204 --> 35:48.439
Yeah.

35:49.206 --> 35:50.940
Okay. That's possible.

35:52.543 --> 35:54.243
It can't be
a coincidence, dad.

35:54.245 --> 35:56.011
The door slamming
right before we could make sure

35:56.013 --> 35:57.615
if she was actually dead?

35:58.816 --> 36:01.083
I was sure.

36:01.085 --> 36:04.887
Well, if it is just a game,
what do we do next?

36:04.889 --> 36:06.521
I think it's safe to assume
that that key

36:06.523 --> 36:08.790
was only supposed to get us
into the closet

36:08.792 --> 36:09.958
so that we found the dead girl.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.559
So if it's not doors that

36:11.561 --> 36:13.895
we're supposed to be opening,

36:13.897 --> 36:15.899
there's gotta be another way
out of here.

36:19.035 --> 36:20.935
Problem is,
it's not big enough

36:20.937 --> 36:22.906
for any of us to fit through.

36:24.274 --> 36:26.240
I could do it.

36:26.242 --> 36:27.742
What? No.

36:27.744 --> 36:29.310
- No way.
- Dad, we have to try something.

36:29.312 --> 36:30.778
Well, let's try something else,
you're not

36:30.780 --> 36:31.813
going out there alone.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.948
I can handle it.

36:33.950 --> 36:37.285
Dad, I can handle it.

36:37.287 --> 36:38.886
Look, I'll be on the other side
of the door

36:38.888 --> 36:40.654
and I'll talk to you
the whole time.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.791
Look, we all wanna
get out of here, okay?

36:43.792 --> 36:45.625
We have to try.

36:45.627 --> 36:47.062
I can do it.

36:48.198 --> 36:50.165
It's just a game, dad.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.201
Okay. And up.

36:54.203 --> 36:56.103
Okay.

36:56.105 --> 36:57.606
- You good?
- Yeah.

36:59.975 --> 37:01.942
- Okay.
- You okay?

37:01.944 --> 37:03.611
- Yeah.
- Be careful.

37:07.116 --> 37:08.250
You all right?

37:10.919 --> 37:12.785
Karen, are you okay?

37:12.787 --> 37:14.887
- Karen?
- I'm okay.

37:14.889 --> 37:16.156
Can you see anything
over there?

37:16.158 --> 37:18.657
What about Tyler?
Is he out there?

37:18.659 --> 37:20.659
It's just another hallway.

37:20.661 --> 37:22.830
And a window with bars on it.

37:26.034 --> 37:27.800
It still won't open.

37:27.802 --> 37:29.704
Take a look around, everywhere.

37:45.186 --> 37:46.287
Karen?

37:47.355 --> 37:50.158
Karen? Do you see anything?

37:59.866 --> 38:01.101
Karen?

38:04.171 --> 38:05.138
Karen?

38:09.342 --> 38:12.977
Karen? Karen?

38:12.979 --> 38:14.245
Karen!

38:14.247 --> 38:16.948
- Karen?
- Josie?

38:16.950 --> 38:18.949
- Come with me.
- Josie!

38:18.951 --> 38:21.086
- Karen!
- I know that was you.

38:21.088 --> 38:24.255
Dad, Josie's here.
She's fine.

38:24.257 --> 38:26.357
Josie, we're done
with the games.

38:26.359 --> 38:28.861
Help me with this. Let's go.

38:30.430 --> 38:31.730
Come on.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.200
- Stand back.
- Come on.

38:36.202 --> 38:38.202
Josie?

38:38.204 --> 38:39.269
- On three.
- One...

38:39.271 --> 38:41.004
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

38:41.006 --> 38:42.172
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

38:54.819 --> 38:56.453
Josie?

38:58.957 --> 39:00.191
Hello?

39:02.361 --> 39:04.227
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

39:04.229 --> 39:06.696
How is this still standing?

39:06.698 --> 39:08.097
This way.

39:15.173 --> 39:16.973
Wait!

39:27.318 --> 39:29.252
It just opened.

39:29.254 --> 39:30.388
Let's go.

39:37.094 --> 39:38.960
Karen?

39:41.765 --> 39:43.333
Please. Hello?

39:47.237 --> 39:49.271
Josie?

39:55.979 --> 39:58.313
- Find the master key.
- Josie?

41:26.200 --> 41:27.966
<i>It's me. Josie.</i>

41:27.968 --> 41:29.436
<i>Surely you remember me.</i>

41:34.874 --> 41:36.443
No.

42:27.292 --> 42:29.461
Check every door. Please.

42:36.234 --> 42:37.369
Karen?

42:40.539 --> 42:41.571
- Karen.
- Ty.

42:41.573 --> 42:44.507
This isn't funny anymore!

42:44.509 --> 42:46.311
Ty, are you out here?

42:48.212 --> 42:50.045
These
are not gonna budge.

42:50.047 --> 42:51.947
Karen!

42:51.949 --> 42:54.149
This isn't funny!

43:13.437 --> 43:14.572
Karen?

43:25.048 --> 43:26.883
This place is amazing.

43:31.020 --> 43:32.122
Karen!

45:37.142 --> 45:38.344
Door!

45:43.649 --> 45:46.683
Can we at least remember to prop
the doors open from now on?

46:02.468 --> 46:04.200
What the hell room
is this?

46:04.202 --> 46:05.569
Does it matter anymore?

46:08.507 --> 46:10.406
- Game is still on.
- Oh, yeah?

46:10.408 --> 46:12.608
So all of this
is still part of it?

46:12.610 --> 46:15.113
- The clock is still ticking.
- To what?

46:19.183 --> 46:22.520
Man. This place gets crazier
every second.

46:31.396 --> 46:34.497
Oh, we've seen this one before.

46:34.499 --> 46:37.533
Maybe they're trying
to tell us something.

46:37.535 --> 46:39.902
No. They're just
screwing with us.

46:39.904 --> 46:41.503
Hey, that was on for a reason.

46:41.505 --> 46:43.438
Yeah, well, it's giving me
a headache, okay?

46:43.440 --> 46:45.574
I'm not just gonna sit around
here piecing together clues

46:45.576 --> 46:47.877
while my daughter is missing
in this house somewhere.

46:47.879 --> 46:49.277
Well, unless you know
another way

46:49.279 --> 46:50.512
outta here,
you don't have a choice.

46:50.514 --> 46:52.215
Like it or not,
we've to play the game.

46:54.251 --> 46:56.253
That's gonna drive me nuts.

47:59.514 --> 48:01.716
Hm. Found a lock.

48:03.652 --> 48:05.620
So we're looking
for numbers.

48:09.691 --> 48:12.392
You know what, this projector
was on when we came in.

48:12.394 --> 48:14.395
So, obviously, they want us
to pay attention to it.

48:17.297 --> 48:18.765
Do you think the combination
might be on the reel?

48:18.767 --> 48:21.803
Could be. There's two of them.
Here's another.

48:29.843 --> 48:31.745
This is so weird.

48:40.521 --> 48:43.254
Okay. Okay, here we go.

48:53.566 --> 48:55.268
Can you make any of that out?

48:56.770 --> 48:58.502
No.

49:55.359 --> 49:57.328
Awake. Awake.

49:58.362 --> 49:59.863
Awake.

49:59.865 --> 50:02.000
Awake. Awake.

50:14.945 --> 50:16.680
Does that projector move?

50:22.453 --> 50:24.119
- No? I need, um, um...
- No.

50:24.121 --> 50:27.623
- Uh, a mirror. I need a mirror.
- What are you talking about?

50:27.625 --> 50:29.958
I, uh, subbed
for this physics teacher

50:29.960 --> 50:31.592
at the school that I work at.

50:31.594 --> 50:33.427
He did this trick.

50:33.429 --> 50:37.132
If you point a strobe light
at a moving fan,

50:37.134 --> 50:39.734
it makes it look like
it's standing still.

50:39.736 --> 50:41.905
There might be something on
those fan blades we need to see.

50:46.042 --> 50:47.608
Got it. I got it.

50:47.610 --> 50:48.912
- Got it?
- Yeah.

50:56.385 --> 50:57.587
They're numbers.

51:02.524 --> 51:03.793
There they are.

51:07.864 --> 51:10.664
- You ready?
- Yeah.

51:10.666 --> 51:12.934
- Seven.
- Yeah.

51:12.936 --> 51:15.036
Three.

51:15.038 --> 51:17.071
- Eight.
- Wait. Wait.

51:17.073 --> 51:18.471
- Eight?
- Yeah.

51:18.473 --> 51:20.342
- Okay.
- Two.

51:27.416 --> 51:28.582
Well, let's get the hell
out of here.

51:28.584 --> 51:29.685
Let's go.

51:34.122 --> 51:35.824
Melanie, let's go.

51:40.128 --> 51:41.962
Hey, guys,
are you seeing this?

51:41.964 --> 51:43.731
Come on. Hurry up!

51:47.768 --> 51:48.834
What is this?

51:53.908 --> 51:55.776
That, that's me.

51:58.079 --> 51:59.413
Hurry up!

52:00.848 --> 52:02.815
Melanie, come on.
Hurry the hell up!

52:02.817 --> 52:04.585
Shit!

52:05.518 --> 52:07.420
Melanie! Melanie!

52:10.523 --> 52:11.959
What is this?

52:32.245 --> 52:34.080
Okay, this is good.

52:35.682 --> 52:37.183
This is really good.

52:45.624 --> 52:46.759
Okay.

53:05.077 --> 53:06.211
Guys?

53:14.019 --> 53:17.254
Well, what's she doing? We left
the key right there in the lock.

53:17.256 --> 53:19.923
What the... Tell me you have
nothing to do with this.

53:19.925 --> 53:20.958
What are you talking about?

53:20.960 --> 53:22.092
You seem to know an awful lot

53:22.094 --> 53:23.293
about these rooms.

53:23.295 --> 53:24.927
You solved more of them
than I have.

53:24.929 --> 53:26.595
Nothing fazes you.
What are you doing...

53:26.597 --> 53:28.499
Get the hell off me!

53:39.043 --> 53:40.178
Michael?

53:42.213 --> 53:44.649
Andrew! Guys, answer me!

53:50.989 --> 53:53.888
Oh! Ty!

53:53.890 --> 53:57.159
Oh, God, Ty, I'm sorry.
This is happening.

54:16.613 --> 54:17.812
Awake.

54:17.814 --> 54:19.049
Awake.

54:55.683 --> 54:57.117
Karen!

54:57.119 --> 54:59.153
- Karen! Oh, my God.
- Oh. Oh, my God. Andrew.

54:59.155 --> 55:01.055
It's okay. It's okay.

55:01.057 --> 55:03.157
It's all right.
It's okay. Come here.

55:03.159 --> 55:05.725
Oh, my God, Karen.
What are you doing here, huh?

55:05.727 --> 55:07.194
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

55:07.196 --> 55:09.296
Where's my dad?

55:09.298 --> 55:10.830
What's happening to us?

55:10.832 --> 55:12.865
I don't know.
I really don't know.

55:12.867 --> 55:14.734
You didn't see anybody else
out there?

55:14.736 --> 55:17.036
No, nothing.

55:17.038 --> 55:20.106
I thought I saw Josie,
but then I didn't.

55:20.108 --> 55:22.141
This place
is playing tricks on us.

55:22.143 --> 55:25.644
No. No,
there's somebody else here.

55:25.646 --> 55:27.712
Something.

55:27.714 --> 55:30.283
I think
it killed Josie for real.

55:30.285 --> 55:32.087
I think
it's trying to kill us.

55:33.821 --> 55:36.155
Josie said the inventor's back.

55:36.157 --> 55:37.923
What did she mean by that?

55:37.925 --> 55:40.661
I don't know.
I don't know, Karen.

55:47.367 --> 55:49.734
Come on.

55:49.736 --> 55:51.937
Why are you all alone?

55:51.939 --> 55:53.205
Huh?

55:53.207 --> 55:54.940
How did you find me?

55:54.942 --> 55:56.743
I heard your scream.

55:59.079 --> 56:00.811
- You are alone?
- Yeah.

56:00.813 --> 56:02.615
Karen, what are you getting at?

56:05.751 --> 56:08.320
Where is my dad, Andrew?

56:08.322 --> 56:11.256
Karen, we split up
to come and find you.

56:11.258 --> 56:13.325
And then I heard you screaming.

56:13.327 --> 56:16.060
Uh... Look at me.

56:16.062 --> 56:18.863
This is just a game, okay?

56:18.865 --> 56:20.831
It's nothing
but a sick, twisted game.

56:20.833 --> 56:22.166
None of this stuff is real.

56:22.168 --> 56:25.136
Karen, there is
a perfectly good explanation

56:25.138 --> 56:27.271
for all of these things.

56:27.273 --> 56:29.142
We're gonna get through this,
okay?

57:00.172 --> 57:01.971
<i>Hello?</i>

57:01.973 --> 57:03.909
- Hello?
- <i>It sounds like...</i>

57:05.210 --> 57:06.910
Sounds like...

57:06.912 --> 57:09.012
<i>It's just a gag,
it's recording my voice</i>

57:09.014 --> 57:10.979
<i>and playing it back to me,
but I don't know...</i>

57:10.981 --> 57:12.915
You don't know what this means.

57:12.917 --> 57:14.917
You don't know
what any of this means.

57:14.919 --> 57:16.987
<i>Melanie, what is it?</i>

57:18.290 --> 57:20.157
He's there now, isn't he?

57:21.926 --> 57:23.461
Let me speak to him?

57:24.361 --> 57:25.396
<i>Hello?</i>

57:27.097 --> 57:29.198
Ty! Oh, Ty...

57:29.200 --> 57:31.366
Ty, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

57:31.368 --> 57:32.968
- <i>This isn't funny.</i>
- <i>That's not me.</i>

57:32.970 --> 57:36.205
It's not me, Ty. It's not me.

57:36.207 --> 57:38.540
You just have
to get out of there. Just run.

57:38.542 --> 57:41.811
Please, Ty, just run!
Run! Get out!

57:47.850 --> 57:50.053
What do you want?

57:55.792 --> 57:57.293
Get away!

58:08.504 --> 58:10.173
What do you want?

58:27.956 --> 58:30.190
- Five people.
- Hm?

58:30.192 --> 58:33.326
Josie said
that five people went missing.

58:33.328 --> 58:35.462
It's our job
to help them escape.

58:35.464 --> 58:37.397
Yeah, so?

58:37.399 --> 58:41.003
So what if this is some,
like, sick game? I mean...

58:44.473 --> 58:47.942
What if we are the five people
that we have to help escape?

58:59.220 --> 59:00.389
Karen?

59:01.556 --> 59:03.357
Answer me, please!

59:04.859 --> 59:06.093
Where are you?

59:10.498 --> 59:11.932
Hello?

59:13.434 --> 59:14.969
Is anyone here?

59:21.509 --> 59:22.576
What?

01:03:32.886 --> 01:03:34.253
What?

01:03:42.328 --> 01:03:43.763
<i>This isn't a game.</i>

01:03:45.498 --> 01:03:47.765
It's like we signed up
for some experiment.

01:03:47.767 --> 01:03:50.768
- Some...
- You want us to find the key?

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:52.570
We'll find the damn key!

01:03:52.572 --> 01:03:54.337
Help me look.
We're gonna find this thing.

01:03:54.339 --> 01:03:55.708
We're gonna get out of here.

01:04:17.529 --> 01:04:20.097
- Anything yet?
- No.

01:04:43.821 --> 01:04:45.589
I think I found
our way out of here.

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:49.825
Now I just need the key.

01:04:56.467 --> 01:04:58.500
Hey, there's a key here
by the sink.

01:04:58.502 --> 01:04:59.635
No,
that's just an earring.

01:04:59.637 --> 01:05:01.170
I think it's Josie's.

01:05:06.509 --> 01:05:07.575
- Hey!
- Yeah?

01:05:07.577 --> 01:05:08.678
Hey, look.

01:05:11.648 --> 01:05:15.752
It says there should be an exit
right over there.

01:05:21.691 --> 01:05:23.760
- Huh. Mm.
- Shit.

01:05:25.328 --> 01:05:28.228
Maybe I'm reading it wrong.

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:29.964
- Uh...
- Guess I'm reading it wrong.

01:05:29.966 --> 01:05:31.999
I don't think you are.

01:05:32.001 --> 01:05:33.335
This is, um...

01:05:35.537 --> 01:05:37.805
just the right amount
of statistic.

01:05:42.377 --> 01:05:43.946
And what do they want us to do?

01:05:45.714 --> 01:05:47.649
And do you think maybe it's...

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:49.751
in there?

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.489
I don't, I don't know.
I don't wanna know.

01:05:55.724 --> 01:05:58.692
All right, let's just...

01:05:58.694 --> 01:06:00.760
Andrew, don't...

01:06:00.762 --> 01:06:01.730
Ugh.

01:06:06.968 --> 01:06:08.367
You're just gonna...

01:06:08.369 --> 01:06:10.302
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

01:06:10.304 --> 01:06:11.272
God...

01:06:15.342 --> 01:06:17.912
Yeah, I feel a lot of... Oh!

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.981
I think I got something.

01:06:24.652 --> 01:06:25.951
Oh, my God!

01:06:30.691 --> 01:06:31.892
Karen?

01:06:34.528 --> 01:06:35.930
Karen?

01:06:58.785 --> 01:07:02.021
Ah, God!

01:07:03.723 --> 01:07:05.857
- Ah!
- All right.

01:07:07.794 --> 01:07:09.261
You okay?

01:07:10.764 --> 01:07:12.496
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

01:07:13.867 --> 01:07:15.699
- God.
- Oh.

01:07:15.701 --> 01:07:17.101
Couldn't get any worse, huh?

01:07:17.103 --> 01:07:18.804
Let's not jinx it.

01:07:22.775 --> 01:07:24.041
No, just...

01:07:24.043 --> 01:07:26.043
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

01:07:27.746 --> 01:07:29.846
Oh.

01:07:29.848 --> 01:07:31.348
I'm not gonna, like,
argue with you or anything.

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:33.318
Feel free.

01:07:37.623 --> 01:07:38.690
Oh!

01:07:40.058 --> 01:07:41.894
It's not real, right?

01:07:43.629 --> 01:07:45.798
- You're right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:53.871 --> 01:07:55.571
Got something?

01:07:55.573 --> 01:07:56.507
Yeah.

01:08:00.578 --> 01:08:01.777
Oh, my God.

01:08:01.779 --> 01:08:04.146
Karen, you're my hero.

01:08:04.148 --> 01:08:05.483
All right.

01:08:06.818 --> 01:08:08.753
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:08:20.397 --> 01:08:22.596
Nice.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.599
- Okay.
- You good?

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.069
Yeah. Just spent enough time
down here for one day.

01:08:28.072 --> 01:08:29.837
All right, listen. You got this.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.006
And I'll be right behind you,
okay?

01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:33.343
All right.

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:50.424
Karen?

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.496
No!

01:09:16.618 --> 01:09:18.051
How are you doing out there?

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:19.921
I'm okay. I'm fine.

01:09:25.627 --> 01:09:28.060
No. No, I'm not...
I can't breathe.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.563
Yes, you can, Karen.
Yes, you can.

01:09:30.564 --> 01:09:33.133
Just... Deep breath.
Listen-listen to my voice.

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.567
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay?

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.535
Think of something, uh...

01:09:36.537 --> 01:09:39.138
Think of something fun.
Think of something outdoorsy.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.040
Like, what?

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:43.142
Uh, think of, um...

01:09:43.144 --> 01:09:45.678
Uh, uh, horseback riding.
Think of horseback riding.

01:09:47.048 --> 01:09:48.816
That wasn't meant to be funny.

01:09:49.984 --> 01:09:51.417
You have no idea.

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:55.587
Fair. I mean...

01:09:55.589 --> 01:09:58.623
I, I could be doing
something fun right now.

01:09:58.625 --> 01:09:59.726
Ah.

01:10:08.635 --> 01:10:10.437
Shh! Did you hear that?

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.073
No, I-I-I, I don't know.
I didn't hear anythin'.

01:10:15.075 --> 01:10:16.908
Yeah. Okay.

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:19.911
Uh, just tell me another joke.

01:10:19.913 --> 01:10:22.614
Uh, I don't think
I told you a first one.

01:10:22.616 --> 01:10:24.649
- Keep talking to me.
- Okay, okay.

01:10:24.651 --> 01:10:26.618
Uh, so two guys,
they walk into a bar.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.652
One guy
says to the other guy...

01:10:28.654 --> 01:10:30.621
- Karen!
- Andrew!

01:10:30.623 --> 01:10:33.992
Andrew! Andrew! Andrew!

01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:37.763
Andrew!

01:10:42.102 --> 01:10:43.968
Andrew!

01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:47.071
Karen? Karen?

01:10:50.276 --> 01:10:51.477
Karen?

01:10:53.579 --> 01:10:54.714
Karen?

01:10:56.682 --> 01:10:57.717
Karen?

01:11:20.905 --> 01:11:22.540
What the hell!

01:11:29.347 --> 01:11:30.815
Oh, God.

01:11:49.234 --> 01:11:51.099
Melanie.

01:11:51.101 --> 01:11:52.601
Karen? Karen?

01:11:52.603 --> 01:11:53.969
- Dad!
- Karen?

01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:56.271
- Dad! Dad!
- Karen.

01:11:56.273 --> 01:11:59.641
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:11:59.643 --> 01:12:02.377
Oh...

01:12:02.379 --> 01:12:04.913
- Wait. Are you hurt?
- No, I'm okay.

01:12:04.915 --> 01:12:06.647
- Dad, it's not mine.
- No.

01:12:08.786 --> 01:12:09.820
Yeah.

01:12:11.955 --> 01:12:14.855
I don't know
what happened out there.

01:12:14.857 --> 01:12:17.125
Dad, I don't know
what's happening to us.

01:12:17.127 --> 01:12:20.328
Hey, come here, come here.
You're okay.

01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:21.731
Where's Andrew?

01:12:28.137 --> 01:12:30.638
- Just don't leave me again.
- I won't.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.774
No way.

01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:34.308
I'm here, I'm here.

01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:37.278
- Who's doing this to us?
- I don't know.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.381
I don't know, I don't know
how we're gonna get out of here.

01:12:40.383 --> 01:12:41.714
And I think
we're gonna die here.

01:12:41.716 --> 01:12:43.150
No, no. Listen to me, okay?

01:12:43.152 --> 01:12:44.851
Listen. We are not gonna die.

01:12:44.853 --> 01:12:46.320
We're gonna
get out of here, okay?

01:12:46.322 --> 01:12:49.722
I'm gonna do everything I can.

01:12:49.724 --> 01:12:51.292
It doesn't matter
what we go through, dad.

01:12:51.294 --> 01:12:53.360
None of them will let you out.

01:12:54.663 --> 01:12:55.995
Wait, what?

01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:58.164
Maybe the room
is resetting itself.

01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:01.034
Okay, come on, stand up.
I got you. Come on.

01:13:01.036 --> 01:13:03.269
Don't look at her.
Don't look at her. Come here.

01:13:03.271 --> 01:13:05.774
Come here. Come here.

01:13:09.344 --> 01:13:11.847
Wait. Don't look.
Don't look at her.

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:17.319
- It's locked again.
- What does that mean?

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.255
Okay.

01:13:21.789 --> 01:13:23.289
- Dad.
- Just wait.

01:13:23.291 --> 01:13:24.923
- Stand back, okay?
- Dad, what are you...

01:13:24.925 --> 01:13:27.393
- Just stand back, please.
- What are you doing?

01:13:27.395 --> 01:13:30.030
Stand back.

01:13:34.735 --> 01:13:36.135
Read me those number.

01:13:36.137 --> 01:13:38.904
- Counterclockwise.
- Okay.

01:13:38.906 --> 01:13:40.973
Seven.

01:13:40.975 --> 01:13:42.341
- Three.
- Yeah.

01:13:42.343 --> 01:13:44.076
- Eight.
- Eight.

01:13:44.078 --> 01:13:45.980
- Two.
- Okay.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:50.748
Let's get out of here.

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:52.717
Wait, how did you know
how to do that?

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:54.153
I've been here before. Come on.

01:13:54.155 --> 01:13:55.853
I think we have
to play the game over again.

01:13:55.855 --> 01:13:58.055
- This way. This way.
- I can't see anything.

01:13:58.057 --> 01:13:59.090
- It's dark.
- It's okay.

01:13:59.092 --> 01:14:00.758
Just keep moving forward.

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.059
Just let me go first.

01:14:02.061 --> 01:14:03.364
You should go.

01:14:04.864 --> 01:14:06.833
I think
this is the last room.

01:14:12.305 --> 01:14:14.071
You know, this is a sick joke.

01:14:16.309 --> 01:14:18.744
It's gonna be okay,
but we have to focus.

01:14:22.182 --> 01:14:25.116
- Oh, my God! Tyler!
- Awake! Awake!

01:14:25.118 --> 01:14:27.819
- Awake!
- Tyler, stop!

01:14:37.863 --> 01:14:40.797
It's, it's like
he didn't even see us.

01:14:40.799 --> 01:14:43.066
You said he was dead.

01:14:43.068 --> 01:14:46.002
He was. He...

01:14:46.004 --> 01:14:48.138
He, he is.
That can't be him, Karen.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.973
It's impossible.

01:14:49.975 --> 01:14:51.343
But how would...

01:14:53.478 --> 01:14:56.246
What if that's what
this whole place is?

01:14:56.248 --> 01:14:59.115
- What?
- An echo.

01:14:59.117 --> 01:15:02.084
What if Josie's one, too?

01:15:02.086 --> 01:15:05.854
An echo of something
that already happened.

01:15:05.856 --> 01:15:08.958
So then, let's get back to her,
find the master key

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.429
and let's stop wasting time.

01:15:13.431 --> 01:15:14.863
No, it's raven,
then wolf, right?

01:15:14.865 --> 01:15:16.000
Uh, yeah.

01:15:17.802 --> 01:15:19.868
We have to tune the radio,
right?

01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:22.371
No, we already know that it's
gonna save her. All right.

01:15:22.373 --> 01:15:23.439
It's five hours from midnight.

01:15:23.441 --> 01:15:25.307
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:15:25.309 --> 01:15:28.077
Thirteen. Eight.

01:15:28.079 --> 01:15:31.313
Seven. Eighteen.

01:15:31.315 --> 01:15:34.350
Yes. That should've worked.

01:15:34.352 --> 01:15:36.285
Then what went wrong?
What changed?

01:15:36.287 --> 01:15:38.487
- We changed.
- What do you mean?

01:15:38.489 --> 01:15:40.021
It wasn't just telling us
the time,

01:15:40.023 --> 01:15:42.591
it was warning us
of what would happen.

01:15:42.593 --> 01:15:45.428
- There were five of us.
- And now there are only two.

01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:54.037
- Okay. Got it. Got it.
- Come on. Yeah. Okay.

01:16:11.186 --> 01:16:15.088
- Find the master key.
- It's not here.

01:16:15.090 --> 01:16:19.226
- No, it has to be.
- There's nothing here.

01:16:19.228 --> 01:16:22.929
Wait, her necklace. It had a
key on it, remember? It's gone.

01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:24.800
Yeah, but the question is where.

01:16:30.272 --> 01:16:32.205
Dad?

01:16:32.207 --> 01:16:33.575
Dad, her stomach.

01:16:37.313 --> 01:16:41.180
The other room I was in,
the morgue...

01:16:41.182 --> 01:16:42.349
you know, it had this thing,
it was,

01:16:42.351 --> 01:16:45.117
it was like an autopsy report.

01:16:45.119 --> 01:16:46.553
<i>I didn't think about it
then, but it said</i>

01:16:46.555 --> 01:16:48.254
<i>the victim died
of the wound just...</i>

01:16:48.256 --> 01:16:51.157
I need you to back away. Okay?

01:16:51.159 --> 01:16:52.358
I need you to back away
right now.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.295
- Dad...
- Right now, Karen, please.

01:16:56.664 --> 01:16:59.198
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I do not want you to see this.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.269
- Dad...
- Please.

01:17:04.205 --> 01:17:05.604
Dad, what are you doing?

01:17:05.606 --> 01:17:07.175
Oh, God!

01:17:10.944 --> 01:17:12.180
Oh!

01:17:15.982 --> 01:17:19.250
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

01:17:20.621 --> 01:17:23.689
Dad. Dad, it's okay...

01:17:26.393 --> 01:17:28.161
- Dad, there's someone coming!
- Okay!

01:17:33.033 --> 01:17:34.466
- I got it.
- Dad, there's something coming!

01:17:34.468 --> 01:17:35.602
Okay.

01:17:49.383 --> 01:17:52.249
Dad!

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:54.418
- Go, go, go!
- Dad, the key.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.135
- What the hell?
- Dad...

01:18:11.237 --> 01:18:13.537
I've been here before.

01:18:13.539 --> 01:18:15.441
Get in here, get in here,
get in here.

01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:03.445
Sorry.

01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:23.129
Karen, let's go.

01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:25.534
Seriously?
Just give me a minute.

01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:05.673
Okay, you ready?

01:21:36.335 --> 01:21:38.836
<i>No, you take it from me,
you go up there,</i>

01:21:38.838 --> 01:21:41.708
<i>you're gonna have
one hell of a time.</i>

01:21:52.551 --> 01:21:54.651
<i>Escape Room.</i>

01:21:54.653 --> 01:21:55.953
<i>You've been talking
about these things, right?</i>

01:21:55.955 --> 01:21:57.155
<i>You said you wanted to try one.</i>

01:22:00.492 --> 01:22:04.728
<i>All I know is,
a lot of people go up there</i>

01:22:04.730 --> 01:22:07.399
<i>and you never
hear from them again.</i>

01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:20.277
Dad.

01:22:26.517 --> 01:22:27.585
Dad.

01:22:30.521 --> 01:22:32.721
- Dad.
- What?

01:22:32.723 --> 01:22:33.858
The car.

01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:39.363
Come on.

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:58.579
Dad, what's happening with us?

01:22:58.581 --> 01:23:01.949
I don't know. I don't know.

01:23:01.951 --> 01:23:03.787
- But let's get out of here.
- Okay.

01:23:09.592 --> 01:23:10.627
Okay.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:16.566
Okay.

01:23:17.967 --> 01:23:19.567
See if you can find the key.

01:23:19.569 --> 01:23:22.937
- Dad?
- Just check the glove box.

01:23:26.843 --> 01:23:27.911
Dad.

01:23:38.854 --> 01:23:39.922
No.

01:23:43.926 --> 01:23:45.461
What the hell?

01:24:35.716 --> 01:24:38.510
