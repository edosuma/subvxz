WEBVTT

00:04.438 --> 00:04.872
- Ahh, orgasmatron.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.209
This is just the kind
of pampering I needed

00:08.242 --> 00:10.144
after UTH kicked my ath.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.380
- And whipped it, slapped
it, pickled it.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.781
It was like
50 Shades of Spa.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.550
- Now I'll be all preened
and polished

00:16.584 --> 00:19.287
as I descend into Hades
for my job.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.123
- Yeah, I don't know how I feel
about that shoot, Jill.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.457
Actually, that's
not true.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.093
I don't have a good feeling.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.394
- It's a national campaign!

00:26.427 --> 00:27.395
- For Brooke.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.130
- For myself!

00:29.163 --> 00:31.365
I still can't believe
she asked me.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.500
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.602
- Oh, she throws you
in a hole

00:34.635 --> 00:37.538
and asks you to rub
lotion on its skin.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.408
- I hadn't thought of that.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.310
Woman: Four manicures,
please.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.611
Oh, hey Jill.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.180
- Hey guys.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.150
- What part of your life
did this crew crawl out of?

00:49.183 --> 00:51.485
- [whispering] They're moms
in Hazel's class.

00:51.519 --> 00:55.389
- So, how are things
[coughs] downtown?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.591
- Lila, I'm in agony.
- Me too.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.560
This box is on fire.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.529
Move over Alicia Keys.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.597
- What time is your shoot?
- Shh.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.267
- I went to
Clyde's and Pasteur.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.236
There's no Monistat left
on the shelves.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.404
It's like there's a run on it.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.540
- If men had vageens,
Mom-istat would be

01:12.573 --> 01:15.309
in hand pumps in public
bathrooms across the country.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.877
- Seriously.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.281
- Lulu, Margaret, do you
guys have it too?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.682
- Are we on the
same cycle?

01:21.715 --> 01:23.517
Is there a cycle for
yeast infections?

01:23.551 --> 01:25.119
- I don't think so.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.620
I had my fair share of
critch in college,

01:26.654 --> 01:28.456
but it was never
this bad.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.192
I almost molested my
desktop cactus.

01:31.225 --> 01:35.329
And I can't so much as
look at cottage cheese.

01:35.363 --> 01:40.468
- Something's rotten and I'm
gonna crack it wide open.

01:40.501 --> 01:44.405
[theme music]
* Hey yes you know

01:44.438 --> 01:47.441
* I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling fine *

01:49.510 --> 01:52.213
- Jill, I'd like to do a quick
walk-through of the line.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.581
- Sure!

01:53.614 --> 01:56.184
- Since my life-altering
trip to India,

01:56.217 --> 01:58.552
I've only been able to
think about two things:

01:58.586 --> 02:00.588
tabletop and housewares.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.224
I need these jewel
tones to be vibrant.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.459
- Well styling opposing
hues together

02:05.493 --> 02:06.894
will really make them pop
in the photos.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.631
- Perfect. Diana Vreeland
once said,

02:10.664 --> 02:14.235
"Pink is the navy blue of
India," and it's true.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.470
Now, more than ever.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.372
- So I was expecting some
more animal prints.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.508
Didn't you guys see like
tigers and elephants

02:20.541 --> 02:23.344
and shit on your
East Asian safari?

02:23.377 --> 02:26.180
- What happens on safari
stays on safari.

02:26.214 --> 02:29.717
- What, did you make like a
dentist and gun down Mufasa?

02:29.750 --> 02:33.187
- Oh!

02:35.956 --> 02:39.593
[Indian-style music]

02:39.627 --> 02:44.265
So here we have a tasseled
throw pillow

02:44.298 --> 02:46.767
and a sequin-rimmed
bolster.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.736
Great, right?

02:48.769 --> 02:51.572
Ugh, and I love
this doormat.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.675
Over here are
Hindu-inspired steak knives.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.945
They have uh, leather
sheath and handle.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.414
Feel. Don't you just
love their girth?

03:00.448 --> 03:02.716
- I'm pretty sure steak
is verboten?

03:02.750 --> 03:06.420
- Oh, and this is a Taj Mahal
dog bed. Cute.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.223
And these are some
serving trays.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.259
These are coasters here and-

03:11.292 --> 03:13.227
- Whoa, whoa!
- Here we have-

03:13.261 --> 03:16.230
- Brooke, Von Weber
cannot sell objects

03:16.264 --> 03:17.531
that have
swastikas on them.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.699
- They're Devanagari.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.568
It's the Indian symbol
for Luck.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.503
They're the good
kind of swastika.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.971
- It's not cholesterol.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.740
There is no "good
kind" of swastika.

03:26.774 --> 03:30.444
- Girls, Jill is vetoing
the trays.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.979
- The swastikas?

03:32.012 --> 03:34.548
Oh, come now.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.417
The design isn't even
that big.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.453
At worst, they're just
a little Nazi.

03:39.487 --> 03:42.323
- The phrase, "little Nazi,"
only makes sense

03:42.356 --> 03:43.791
if it's referring to
Hitler youth.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.726
- Okay, fine.
They're killed.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.829
- Thank you.
Okay, let's start.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.632
So I'm picturing these Vishnu
and Shiva salt and pepper

03:51.665 --> 03:54.735
shakers with the
sapphire placemats.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.371
Why don't you guys set those?

03:57.405 --> 03:58.772
- You're finally ready.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.641
- Well I've been prepping
all week.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.544
- No, I mean, at this point
in your career.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.646
I couldn't lift you
up before

04:05.679 --> 04:08.316
because I couldn't reach
down that low.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.683
You had to climb.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.519
- Thank you?

04:11.552 --> 04:14.588
[energetic rock music]

04:18.526 --> 04:22.363
[phone ringing]

04:22.396 --> 04:24.765
- If this isn't about the
itch sitch, I can't talk.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.768
- Well I have two more cases:
Parker and Simone!

04:27.801 --> 04:30.671
- So it's a larger population
in the affected hot zone

04:30.704 --> 04:31.772
than we thought.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.640
- No, that's the thing!

04:32.673 --> 04:34.475
They're not moms at
Hazel's school.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.344
They're at Nightingale and
Sacred Heart.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.412
- Ah! A new locus of
infection!

04:38.446 --> 04:40.548
I smell an epidemic.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.383
- Where are Dustin Hoffman
and Rene Russo

04:42.416 --> 04:44.418
in full-on hazmat suits?

04:44.452 --> 04:45.853
We need to find
that monkey.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.355
- Slow down.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.623
First I need to make
an accurate diagnosis,

04:49.657 --> 04:50.858
and since I can't examine
these women,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.693
I need you to
collect more data.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.595
- Okay, I'll just zip over
to Duane Reade

04:54.628 --> 04:56.397
and pick up a speculum.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.765
- Is the discharge white
and chunky?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.800
Or colorless and frothy?

04:59.833 --> 05:03.103
- [gags] Chunder
mid-espohagus and rising.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.739
- I need to determine if the
infection is yeast or bacterial.

05:05.773 --> 05:06.840
- I'm hanging up.

05:06.874 --> 05:07.841
- At least tell me if it
smells like

05:07.875 --> 05:09.677
a clam chowder bread bowl
when you walk by!

05:09.710 --> 05:11.612
- Ew. Bye!

05:25.793 --> 05:28.429
Let's take a selfie.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.863
You ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

of the next two days,

05:47.481 --> 05:50.150

05:50.183 --> 05:53.721
The trip to Mars will take an
extreme toll on your body.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.590
So only those in peak physical
and mental condition

05:56.624 --> 05:57.891

06:01.194 --> 06:06.400
Do you have what it takes?

06:09.470 --> 06:10.638
[camera flash clicking]

06:10.671 --> 06:13.674
- You know what Todd, I think
we need to take this strobe

06:13.707 --> 06:15.876
down a stop. Thank you.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.711
All right, let's take

weights on a lucite cube

with the linens fanned
out underneath.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.720
- Jill. I say this with all
due respect,

06:26.754 --> 06:30.458
but you do what you do,
and let us do what we do.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.892
- What is it that
you do?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.661
- This is our jurisdiction.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.764
- Simone, it's a product
shoot, not a murder case.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.899
- Not yet.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.000
- How's it going?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.770
- Great, this place is

06:42.803 --> 06:44.872
a photographer's
wet dream.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.540
- Booking it was the last
good thing

06:46.574 --> 06:50.478
that asshole Devon did before I
was forced to fire him.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.745
- Have you heard
from him at all?

06:51.779 --> 06:52.713
- Not a peep.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.615
He's probably back
to steaming sweater sets

06:54.648 --> 06:56.617
at Ann Taylor Loft.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.689
I don't miss him.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.459
- Thanks for coming down to
the Village, Mother.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.828
- Well, I love the
Village, but I most certainly

07:07.861 --> 07:09.797
don't understand the appeal
of this restaurant.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.631
- Oh, it's fun!

07:10.664 --> 07:12.199
We take the kids
here all the time.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.935
- Why would I pay if I
have to cook my own food?

07:14.968 --> 07:16.670
- I'll cook the food,
how about that?

07:16.704 --> 07:18.506
- All right, fine.
Now the reason I wanted

07:18.539 --> 07:21.475
to meet is that I'm very
concerned about Alexander

07:21.509 --> 07:23.577
and his looming failure
as a martian.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.745
- What do you mean?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.714
- MarsX is looking for
experts.

The only thing Lex has put
10,000 hours into

07:29.282 --> 07:30.851
is manscaping.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.219
- With all due respect,
Mother,

07:32.252 --> 07:34.855
Lex has achieved
extraordinary success

07:34.888 --> 07:36.924
with no discernible skill set.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.692
- Well, I don't think he's
going to be able to

07:38.726 --> 07:40.761
charm his way onto
that rocket.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.964
And as his mother, I cannot
be expected to comfort him

07:43.997 --> 07:45.733
when he's rejected.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.767
So you're just going
to have to

07:46.800 --> 07:48.802
step up and Swiffer
the mess.

07:48.836 --> 07:52.039

07:52.072 --> 07:53.774
- Hey, how's it going,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.609
- Epic Dads' Night, buddy.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.811
Thanks for introducing
me to that wine place.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.012
I'm taking these guys
there tonight

Kyoto deal.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.517

08:06.554 --> 08:07.555
- Dads' Night?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.289
- It was a big success.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.091
- Anderson, have I taught
you nothing?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.860
You can never do too
good a job

08:12.893 --> 08:15.062
or they'll expect you
to keep doing it.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.831
You have to do the bare
minimum in life.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.767
- First up,the sliced
Kobe beef.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.769
Give that a good sear for thirty
seconds before flipping.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.671
- Gotcha, thanks very much!

08:23.704 --> 08:27.007
- And my boss would
kill me

08:27.040 --> 08:28.609
if he knew I was
saying this,

08:28.642 --> 08:30.010
but I love the way
you present!

08:30.043 --> 08:32.713
You are serving silver-screen
realness today!

08:32.746 --> 08:36.049
Extra fishy, Candy Ass!

08:37.785 --> 08:38.986

just say?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.054
- I don't know.

08:41.088 --> 08:45.125
- Does this perfume smell

08:57.104 --> 09:00.107
All of these moms have
strepgina!

09:06.046 --> 09:07.080
- So you're saying all these
ladies have strep throat

09:08.215 --> 09:09.583
but in their vagina?

09:09.617 --> 09:11.284
- Indeed.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.953
- I've never heard
of that.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.187
Is it common?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.723
- Individual cases are not
uncommon,

09:15.756 --> 09:17.157
but an outbreak is.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.025
We've got to figure out

09:18.058 --> 09:20.694
what's linking these
women together.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.996
- Maybe it's those
gel seats at spin class?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.598
Those always felt gross
to me.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.733
- No, it has to be
direct contact

09:25.766 --> 09:27.300
and they're not
riding naked.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.202

09:29.236 --> 09:31.104
that I don't
want to know about.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.272
- What about a
waxing salon?

09:32.305 --> 09:33.340
- Talk to me.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.042
- I read about this place in
Queens that got busted

09:35.075 --> 09:37.177
for not using linen
strips and instead

09:37.210 --> 09:39.012
they just the put
the hairy wax back

09:39.046 --> 09:40.948
in the melter thingy
between clients.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.149
- Ew.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.183
- It can't be that.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.284
These bitches don't
go to Queens

09:44.317 --> 09:46.053
unless they have to
fly commercial.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.387
- Obviously, the most
common way

09:47.420 --> 09:49.990
for this to proliferate
is sex.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.059
So either these ladies are all
scissoring each other-

09:52.092 --> 09:53.193
- Not a chance.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.396
- Or they got eaten out by
the same guy.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.065
What man could chow that
much box

09:58.098 --> 10:01.001
and with strep throat?

10:01.034 --> 10:03.303
What about that hot
Columbian spacialist

10:03.336 --> 10:04.938
who organized your closet?

10:04.972 --> 10:07.007
Didn't you tell me boned
half his clients?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.175
- He got deported.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.180
- Dottie's Homework
Resistance teacher?

10:13.213 --> 10:16.049
- Katie Garner who recommended
him hates sex.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.085
She drunkenly confided in me
once that she

10:18.118 --> 10:19.753
only sleeps with her husband
on their anniversary.

10:19.787 --> 10:23.657
- When was that?
Open your Facebook.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.094
- Two weeks ago!

10:27.127 --> 10:29.196
- Blow up the picture.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.264
- He's 80.
He's not Patient Zero.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.736
- Hey ladies.
- Hey.

10:35.769 --> 10:39.006
- How's it uh...going?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.743
- No, but maybe all
of the women

10:42.776 --> 10:45.245
slept with their
own husbands-

10:45.278 --> 10:48.248
- And?

10:48.281 --> 10:51.685
- And the husbands all
have strep dick!

13:24.237 --> 13:25.839

13:45.525 --> 13:48.528
The only thing they'd
share are stock tips.

as a thank you

14:09.917 --> 14:11.418

14:11.451 --> 14:12.920
- Got it from the
Dads' Night Out.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.989
We had a wine tasting.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.024
- Show me the website.

14:17.057 --> 14:17.891
- Of what?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.010
- There's no Monistat left
on the shelves.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.411
- Two more cases.

- Do you guys have it too?

14:39.512 --> 14:40.580
- Parker and Simone.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.915

14:49.957 --> 14:52.392

Keyser Soze flashback.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.494
Any chance those
Latvian wine sommeliers

14:54.527 --> 14:56.896
were tasting more
than tannins?

15:01.301 --> 15:06.373
- You gotta check out
the Effervescent Room.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.507
- You have headache?

15:07.540 --> 15:08.708
I have cure.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.079
- Best Dads' Night ever!

- Oh, no.
I'm Keyser Soze.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.650
- You figured it out also?

- No, I'm just clumsy.

I'm on the Godfather day
of my period.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.555
What are you guys
talking about?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.258
- Those Latvian wine
sommeliers were escorts!

15:25.292 --> 15:26.393
- The ringleader had
strep throat,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.728
which is highly contagious.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.298
If the dads got blowies
from her and her cohorts,

15:31.331 --> 15:33.400
they would
get sick dick.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.401
- But none of the dads have
said anything.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.336
- Because men are
asymptomatic as carriers.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.470
They wouldn't have known
they'd had it,

15:37.504 --> 15:39.039
so they'd have sex
with their wives.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.042
Et voila.

A Strepgina epidemic.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.547
You're in deep shit.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.449
- I swear, I didn't know!

15:53.453 --> 15:56.689
Oh God, I'm the chimpanzee.

16:03.230 --> 16:03.896

that we should

- Coral. Yeah!

- Mind reader!

16:11.071 --> 16:12.305
- No, I love a power clash,

16:12.339 --> 16:15.342
but something
about this isn't working.

to revamp my website

16:29.589 --> 16:31.758

16:31.791 --> 16:32.825

16:32.859 --> 16:35.028
We're going to have an
Arranged Marriage Registry.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.229
- What do you mean?

16:36.263 --> 16:38.198
- The couple doesn't pick
what they get,

16:38.231 --> 16:41.101
it all just comes,
curated by me.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.236
- Neat!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.505
- Yeah.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.509
- You've all done
incredible work,

16:49.542 --> 16:52.245
which made this
round of cuts very difficult.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.281
Some of you
prevailed physically.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.549
Others mentally.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.252
But we only have room for
those exquisite specimens

16:59.286 --> 17:01.321

17:01.354 --> 17:03.490

18:50.430 --> 18:54.367
- The only people who should run
are children and thieves.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.469
- I just spent a month
and a half sequestered

18:56.503 --> 19:00.307
on a jury and let's just say
if you had been there

19:00.340 --> 19:04.477
it would have been hung.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.914
Trust me, they were 12
very happy men.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.482
- We love you Candy Ass!

19:09.516 --> 19:11.318
- Love you too, baby!

19:11.351 --> 19:12.885
You got money?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.622
Because I do not want
to be a nurse-

19:15.655 --> 19:18.658

19:28.668 --> 19:29.602
- Why didn't you
tell me?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.504
- I didn't know how you
were gonna react.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.840
- Well I loved it.
Truly.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.609
- Phew.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.710
- If you don't mind
my asking,

19:37.744 --> 19:38.778
what made you do it?

19:38.811 --> 19:40.280
- You inspired me.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.715
When I got back from jury
duty to my real life

19:42.749 --> 19:44.617
I felt like I was
missing something.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.687
- What? Pam Tinkler's
acronyms?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.758
- You're amazing.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.327
And exactly what the
community needs right now.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.997
You have the soul of RuPaul
with the body of Helen Mirren.

19:58.030 --> 19:58.998
- Carlos, you know
a lot of men

19:59.031 --> 20:01.934
have made me feel
a lot of different things.

20:01.968 --> 20:06.306
But no one has made me
feel this spectacular

20:06.339 --> 20:08.775
without being
seven inches deep.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.577
- Eight inches.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.916
- Well that's great that
you're proud of the shots.

20:16.949 --> 20:20.853
- Yeah but I'm horrified by
her cultural appropriation:

20:20.887 --> 20:24.023
a five-tiered serving tray she
called a Caste System?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.692
- No.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.926
- Well at least you
got along.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.628
- Disturbingly well.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.964
All right I gotta get
this bra off. BRB.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.268
- What a week.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.269
- Seriously!

20:36.303 --> 20:37.937
I can't believe that
whole strepgina outbreak

20:37.970 --> 20:39.539
was my fault!

20:39.572 --> 20:42.675
Next time I'm just doing
an adult coloring event.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.677
- It's okay, Andy.
You meant well.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.579
You always do.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.947
- Thanks Vanessa.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.016
- And you know you
can confide in me.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.951
- Okay.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.321
- I can get you the help
you need.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.288
- What?

20:55.322 --> 20:57.657
- If one of those
Eastern Euro trash bags

20:57.690 --> 20:58.791
