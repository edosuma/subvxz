- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- I wasn't lying.

00:03.039 --> 00:05.273
I do intend to use the Flaming Sword

00:05.281 --> 00:06.881
to cut through the Gates of Heaven.

00:06.914 --> 00:08.048
But what you left out?

00:08.084 --> 00:10.046
I plan on kicking Mum into Heaven

00:10.062 --> 00:12.052
<i>and slamming the gates on her backside.</i>

00:12.088 --> 00:14.665
- Maybe there's another piece missing.
- MOM: <i>If you find the killer,</i>

00:14.667 --> 00:16.590
<i>then you'll find our piece
of the Flaming Sword.</i>

00:16.626 --> 00:18.066
I went through a lot this last year,

00:18.094 --> 00:20.427
and improv sort of
helped me reorient myself.

00:20.463 --> 00:21.695
LUCIFER: Amenadiel
told you about our trip

00:21.697 --> 00:22.898
back to Heaven, didn't he?

00:22.901 --> 00:25.366
- (shouts)
- <i>You</i> should have told me.

00:25.401 --> 00:28.602
As promised. This opens
a safety deposit box.

00:28.638 --> 00:31.405
LAPD. Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.805
Are you certain this is all that
was in the safety deposit box?

00:34.844 --> 00:36.410
We'll fix it. There's plenty of time.

00:36.412 --> 00:37.820
MOM: <i>Just not for me.</i>

00:37.844 --> 00:41.115
God shattered the Flaming Sword
into three distinct pieces.

00:41.117 --> 00:43.117
The Blade of Death,
the Medallion of Life

00:43.152 --> 00:45.152

them all together.

before Mum spews light everywhere.

09:40.568 --> 09:42.055
You don't have to speak in code.

09:42.058 --> 09:43.802
I can handle adult stuff.

09:43.805 --> 09:45.701
MAZE: So what if your mother explodes?

09:45.758 --> 09:47.102
Why should I care?

09:47.105 --> 09:50.409
Because many, many
humans could get hurt.

09:50.445 --> 09:51.466
Yeah, and?

09:51.469 --> 09:53.225
Oh, nice try, Maze, but I happen to know

09:53.228 --> 09:54.974
there's a few that you care about.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.118
Fine.

09:59.154 --> 10:00.453
But you pay me my standard fee.

10:00.488 --> 10:01.687
No freebies.

10:01.723 --> 10:02.755
Absolutely.

10:02.824 --> 10:04.290
Oh.

10:04.325 --> 10:05.825
Love me a lolli.

10:05.860 --> 10:08.995
Sorry, wussies don't get any.

10:13.468 --> 10:15.768
♪ ♪

10:15.804 --> 10:19.172
♪ My night is day, yeah... ♪

10:19.207 --> 10:22.589
So, I ran the prints,

10:22.628 --> 10:26.612
and it came back as your brother Chet.

10:26.648 --> 10:28.581
I'm sorry.

10:28.616 --> 10:30.483
I know that you've been

10:30.552 --> 10:34.220
living in Mexico, but
can you think of anyone

10:34.255 --> 10:35.953
who may have wanted your brother dead?

10:35.985 --> 10:38.791
My family had many enemies.

10:38.827 --> 10:41.701
It's why I left, to get away from

10:41.732 --> 10:43.596
the Ruiz empire.

10:43.631 --> 10:45.832
I tried to get Chet
to go with me, but...

10:45.867 --> 10:49.635
But, unfortunately, he got
involved in the family business.

10:49.671 --> 10:53.406
I know you were the one
who put my mother in prison.

10:53.441 --> 10:55.241
I also know you were after Chet,

10:55.276 --> 10:58.277
so I know what you think of my family.

10:58.313 --> 11:00.613
But I loved my brother.

11:02.283 --> 11:04.817
He didn't deserve to die.

11:04.853 --> 11:07.053
Especially not like that.

11:07.088 --> 11:09.689
No one deserves to die like that.

11:09.724 --> 11:12.892
Look, I'm gonna work this
case as carefully and fairly

11:12.927 --> 11:15.528
as I would any other case.

11:15.563 --> 11:17.096
I promise you.

11:21.436 --> 11:24.036
Ah, oopsie daisy.

11:24.072 --> 11:25.938
There goes that clue. Klutzy me.

11:25.974 --> 11:29.675
Aw, don't worry, buddy.
I am a total klutz myself.

11:29.711 --> 11:32.879
Which is why I always make a backup.

11:32.914 --> 11:34.046
Oh, good.

11:34.082 --> 11:35.715
Hope it leads us
straight to Chet's killer.

11:35.717 --> 11:36.682
Oh, no,

11:36.718 --> 11:37.998
that's from another crime scene.

11:38.019 --> 11:39.719
I got a big steaming pile of nada

11:39.754 --> 11:41.905
from the Chet Ruiz crime scene.

11:41.929 --> 11:44.522
Oh, good... (chuckles)

11:44.525 --> 11:47.278
ness me, that is awful.

11:47.281 --> 11:48.995
Please tell me you have something.

11:48.997 --> 11:51.163
No, no, nothing. It's so frustrating.

11:51.199 --> 11:53.442
Well, there is one thing I'm waiting on.

11:53.445 --> 11:55.028
But I thought you just
said we had nada.

11:55.031 --> 11:56.769
Well, so the only thing we know for sure

11:56.771 --> 11:58.697
is that someone had to drive
there to dump the body.

11:58.699 --> 12:01.674
So, the tech team is checking
the vicinity for cameras,

12:01.676 --> 12:04.944
but it's such a remote place,
so don't get your hopes up.

12:04.979 --> 12:07.380
Ooh, yes. I think
you're right, Miss Lopez.

12:07.415 --> 12:09.081
Sadly, the only witness to this one

12:09.117 --> 12:11.117
is my dear old dad. (chuckles)

12:11.152 --> 12:13.886
Oh, right. Yes, your
dad... (clicks tongue)

12:13.922 --> 12:15.655
is always watching.

12:16.758 --> 12:19.926
Wait a second. That gives me an idea.

12:19.961 --> 12:20.723
It does?

12:20.726 --> 12:23.462
Satellite imaging takes
sporadic photos of,

12:23.498 --> 12:24.619
well, everything, so...

12:24.622 --> 12:26.899
So there may be footage of the killer

12:26.935 --> 12:28.901
- going to or from the warehouse.
- Exactly.

12:28.937 --> 12:30.603
I mean, it's a long shot,

12:30.638 --> 12:32.338
but thank you, Lucifer.

12:32.373 --> 12:35.174
You're so welcome.

12:35.209 --> 12:37.643
It's me. God chose me.

12:37.679 --> 12:39.069
I'm the favorite son.

12:39.072 --> 12:40.780
This whole time, I actually thought

12:40.782 --> 12:43.316
that God had lost faith
in me, but it was me.

12:43.351 --> 12:44.538
I lost faith in him.

12:44.541 --> 12:46.607
I can see that now.

12:49.891 --> 12:52.992
That losing my powers
must have been a test.

12:55.363 --> 12:57.997
And if so, I failed.

12:58.032 --> 13:00.599
(scoffs softly)

13:00.635 --> 13:02.868
I'm so sorry, Father.

13:02.904 --> 13:05.838
Yes, and how was your pork chop?

13:05.873 --> 13:07.139
(people chuckling)

13:07.175 --> 13:09.141
Okay, that's great.
We'll cut right there.

13:09.177 --> 13:11.043
Hey, can I have the lights please?

13:11.079 --> 13:14.313
(clears throat)

13:14.349 --> 13:15.748
So, uh, good job.

13:15.783 --> 13:18.317
But there are a few subjects
that we try to avoid:

13:18.353 --> 13:20.653
you know, religion, politics,
anything too polarizing.

13:20.688 --> 13:21.654
Okay?

13:21.689 --> 13:23.322
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Totally understand.

13:23.358 --> 13:25.324
- I got this.
- Perfect.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.259
All right, let's give
'em another scenario.

13:27.295 --> 13:30.363
Oh, uh, zookeepers and
the giraffe is pregnant.

13:30.398 --> 13:32.198
(laughs): Okay.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.632
You guys ready?

13:35.837 --> 13:37.403
Action.

13:37.438 --> 13:38.671
Oh, man!

13:38.740 --> 13:40.306
I think she's going into labor!

13:40.341 --> 13:41.574
- Help me!
- (laughter)

13:41.609 --> 13:43.075
How can I help when I'm supposed to

13:43.111 --> 13:44.176
kill my own father?!

13:46.314 --> 13:47.947
And cut.

13:47.982 --> 13:49.382
(Dan clears throat)

13:49.417 --> 13:50.850
(clicks tongue)

13:55.123 --> 13:56.822
It's a little dark, buddy.

13:56.858 --> 13:58.357
- Hmm.
- You know,

13:58.393 --> 13:59.792
just try to have fun with it.

13:59.827 --> 14:01.460
But I thought you
told me this helped you

14:01.496 --> 14:03.662
work through difficult personal matters.

14:04.565 --> 14:06.632
I did.

14:09.937 --> 14:13.325
APB got a hit that it was parked
in the lot across the street.

14:13.328 --> 14:14.974
I'm telling you, we're wasting time.

14:15.009 --> 14:16.209
It was the only vehicle parked

14:16.244 --> 14:18.611
near the crime scene between
midnight and 5:00 a.m.

14:18.646 --> 14:21.180
Yes, but how do you know this
parked van's even the same one?

14:21.215 --> 14:23.115
I mean, there's no license
plates on this image.

14:23.151 --> 14:26.085
Oh, come on! How many vans
have dandelions on the side?

14:26.120 --> 14:28.754
They're not dandelions,
they're jellyfish.

14:28.790 --> 14:30.489
What? Jellyfish?

14:30.525 --> 14:31.791
LUCIFER: Right, yes.

14:31.826 --> 14:33.059
Well, I'm simply saying that

14:33.094 --> 14:35.527
we should be focusing on
more pressing criminal issues.

14:35.530 --> 14:37.764
- Such as?
- Well, I'm glad you asked, actually.

14:37.804 --> 14:39.231
The death of Celeste McDougall.

14:39.267 --> 14:40.800
Very suspicious, indeed.

14:40.835 --> 14:43.369
- She was 92.
- Yes, and fit as a fiddle.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.404
- I mean, look at that smug face. Look.
- I know.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.573
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

14:47.608 --> 14:49.241
LAPD!

14:49.277 --> 14:50.943
Don't move!

14:52.080 --> 14:53.879
You still think we're wasting our time?

14:58.951 --> 15:01.619
Definitely rethinking the
lasagna I had for lunch.

15:01.654 --> 15:03.187
WOMAN: Oh, my gosh.

15:03.222 --> 15:04.555
This is not what it looks like.

15:04.578 --> 15:06.290
What? Minions day out?

15:06.326 --> 15:08.826
Take your hoods off, slowly.

15:12.231 --> 15:15.499
I know this looks bad,
but we can explain.

15:15.535 --> 15:16.767
I'm Ava.

15:16.803 --> 15:18.235
This is my sister Kathleen.

15:18.271 --> 15:19.537
Hi. How ya doin'?

15:19.572 --> 15:21.038
Friendliest serial killers ever.

15:21.074 --> 15:23.741
AVA: Oh, that's hilarious.
We're not killers.

15:23.776 --> 15:24.909
(laughs): God, no.

15:24.944 --> 15:26.610
We run Dandy Lyon Cleaners.

15:26.646 --> 15:28.779
Lyon's our last name. Get it?

15:28.815 --> 15:31.382
We take care of crime
scenes, dead body removals.

15:31.417 --> 15:32.817
All the icky stuff.

15:32.852 --> 15:34.200
But totally legit.

15:34.203 --> 15:36.727
Yeah, like this poor guy,
died of a heart attack.

15:36.730 --> 15:37.965
Like, two weeks ago.

15:37.968 --> 15:39.757
Right, well, perfectly good explanation.

15:39.759 --> 15:41.759
- I knew it. Shall we, Detective?
- Wait, wait, wait.

15:41.761 --> 15:42.669
Why was your van

15:42.672 --> 15:45.262
outside of an abandoned
warehouse in Eagle Rock

15:45.298 --> 15:46.831
at 3:00 a.m. last night?

15:46.866 --> 15:49.307
I'm... pretty sure you're mistaken.

15:49.322 --> 15:51.168
We were nowhere near that area.

15:51.204 --> 15:52.903
Well...

15:52.939 --> 15:55.272
Ugh, no. Eagle Rock.

15:55.308 --> 15:57.608
Do not tell me you
went to see Fred again.

15:57.643 --> 15:59.210
I thought you were done with that jerk.

15:59.245 --> 16:01.779
I was, till I ran into
him at Jamba Juice.

16:01.814 --> 16:03.180
LUCIFER: Understand completely.

16:03.216 --> 16:05.750
I mean, what's more intoxicating
than a Mango-A-Go-Go?

16:05.785 --> 16:07.485
Alibi sorted.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.581
We'll leave you here with
Soupy, and we'll be on our way.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.288
- Come on.
- No. Wait, wait. Hold on.

16:11.324 --> 16:12.623
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:12.658 --> 16:14.047
- Yes?
- Enough with this.

16:14.050 --> 16:16.026
Why are you trying to
rush our investigation?

16:16.028 --> 16:17.954
Why are you still hiding things from me

16:17.969 --> 16:19.435
after all we've been through?

16:19.438 --> 16:21.310
You know I don't lie, Detective.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.218
But you also don't tell the whole truth.

16:23.236 --> 16:24.802
Does this have to do

16:24.837 --> 16:26.704
with what you were
upset about this morning,

16:26.739 --> 16:27.772
with your family?

16:27.807 --> 16:30.341
(sighs) Yes, but I can't explain,

16:30.376 --> 16:31.942
because you wouldn't understand.

16:31.978 --> 16:33.911
Not if you don't talk to me.

16:33.946 --> 16:35.346
Never mind.

16:35.381 --> 16:37.314
I thought we were past this.

16:37.350 --> 16:39.984
Going backwards, Lucifer, is not good.

16:40.019 --> 16:41.450
For anyone.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.595
Trust me, dude, you're gonna
find this really freeing

16:51.597 --> 16:53.330
once you get the hang of it.

16:53.366 --> 16:55.175
And I'll help you through it.

16:55.178 --> 16:57.601
Just takes practice.

16:57.637 --> 16:59.336
You're a good man, Daniel.

16:59.405 --> 17:01.172
(chuckles) Yeah.

17:01.908 --> 17:03.274
Ooh!

17:03.309 --> 17:04.575
Okay.

17:04.609 --> 17:06.277
All right.

17:06.311 --> 17:07.912
Wow. You're strong.

17:07.946 --> 17:09.880
(chuckles)

17:11.951 --> 17:14.218
(quietly): That family is so weird.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.689
"You'll get the hang of it."

17:18.723 --> 17:20.191
"It just takes practice."

17:21.553 --> 17:23.828
And that hug.

17:23.863 --> 17:25.829
You guys doing it?

17:25.865 --> 17:27.330
So, what are you even doing here?

17:27.366 --> 17:29.800
I'm bounty hunting
you, thanks to Lucifer.

17:29.836 --> 17:31.842
Time to assemble the sword, Amenadiel.

17:31.845 --> 17:34.238
I don't know that I want to, Maze.

17:34.273 --> 17:36.140
Father entrusted me
with the final piece.

17:36.175 --> 17:37.295
That changes things.

17:37.298 --> 17:39.877
- Are you coming with me or not?
- Think about it, Mazikeen.

17:39.879 --> 17:42.796
All of my actions, all of my feelings,

17:42.839 --> 17:45.206
they were all just based on lies.

17:45.209 --> 17:47.457
You see, I thought
I had fallen, and I...

17:47.460 --> 17:49.409
- (Taser crackling)
- (grunting)

17:51.324 --> 17:53.357
I don't get paid by the hour.

17:53.392 --> 17:54.859
(floor squeaks)

17:59.031 --> 18:01.765
Oh, my God! Are you going to Paris?

18:01.801 --> 18:03.634
Can I be your travel buddy?

18:03.669 --> 18:04.941
I love Paris.

18:04.957 --> 18:10.074
<i>Les hommes, oh, très
sexy, romantiques, avec...</i>

18:10.109 --> 18:13.110
This is the Paris hotel
in Vegas, actually.

18:13.145 --> 18:14.111
Oh.

18:14.146 --> 18:16.247
Not... going there.

18:16.282 --> 18:18.315
Vegas and me...

18:18.351 --> 18:19.383
(whispers): not pretty.

18:19.418 --> 18:20.885
Yeah, I'm not going, either.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.319
But Kathleen Lyon's ex

18:22.355 --> 18:24.388
Brad did, and according
to his Wobble page,

18:24.423 --> 18:26.323
he's been partying there all weekend.

18:26.359 --> 18:28.292
Oh, well, that blows up

18:28.327 --> 18:31.495
Kathleen's reason for being
in Eagle Rock at 3:00 a.m.

18:31.531 --> 18:35.399
You think our two
sweet, "legit" cleaners

18:35.434 --> 18:37.668
are up to something not so legit?

18:44.610 --> 18:46.277
Hello, Brother.

18:46.312 --> 18:48.112
I notice you've changed your look.

18:48.147 --> 18:49.914
Where's your pretty necklace?

18:49.949 --> 18:52.049
Oh, I've put it in a safe place.

18:52.084 --> 18:54.184
Ah. Keister it, did you?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.753
Nope. Already checked.

18:55.788 --> 18:57.121
Not there.

18:57.156 --> 18:58.188
Lovely.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.423
Listen, Amenadiel,

18:59.458 --> 19:00.891
I need the final piece.

19:00.927 --> 19:03.827
Right. So you and Mom can slice
through the Gates of Heaven

19:03.863 --> 19:04.995
and destroy Father.

19:05.031 --> 19:06.397
Yeah. I know.

19:06.432 --> 19:07.831
(sighs): Right.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.033
Maze, darling, would you mind

19:09.068 --> 19:11.168
running down to the wine
cellar and fetching Mum?

19:11.203 --> 19:13.003
I think she'd like to hear this.

19:17.009 --> 19:19.510
I've been thinking about this, deeply.

19:19.545 --> 19:22.171
And I think that we've been
looking at things the wrong way.

19:22.174 --> 19:22.952
Oh?

19:22.955 --> 19:24.915
That necklace was a gift.

19:24.984 --> 19:26.684
It's not some manipulation.

19:26.719 --> 19:29.086
Well, you only think that because
it was gifted to <i> you.</i>

19:29.121 --> 19:30.287
No, no, Luci!

19:30.323 --> 19:32.323
It's all about perspective.

19:32.358 --> 19:34.024
Father doesn't always make things clear,

19:34.060 --> 19:36.560
because he wants us to
form our own beliefs.

19:36.596 --> 19:39.797
And I strongly believe that
I am to guard that piece.

19:39.832 --> 19:41.498
Now, I may have lost my way,

19:41.534 --> 19:44.201
but that doesn't mean that
I can't rectify things now.

19:44.236 --> 19:46.170
Fine.

19:46.205 --> 19:47.671
What if I was to tell you

19:47.707 --> 19:49.512
I never planned on destroying Dad?

19:49.515 --> 19:52.242
- I'd say you were full of it.
- Yes, I want to assemble the sword,

19:52.244 --> 19:54.358
yes, I want to cut through
the gates, blah, blah,

19:54.361 --> 19:56.480
but then I was just
gonna kick Mum into Heaven

19:56.515 --> 19:58.082
and slam the gates behind her.

19:58.117 --> 20:00.651
Let the two lovebirds torture
each other for eternity.

20:00.686 --> 20:02.314
- And that's better?
- Yes.

20:02.317 --> 20:03.916
No!

20:03.984 --> 20:05.956
Regardless of whether
you're with Mom or not,

20:05.958 --> 20:07.891
I simply can't let Mom loose on Dad.

20:07.927 --> 20:10.060
Now, it is finally time that I go back

20:10.096 --> 20:12.863
to being the loyal soldier
that he entrusted me to be.

20:12.898 --> 20:14.954
Mom is not going anywhere!

20:14.957 --> 20:18.035
Well, I am afraid that we do
not have a choice, Brother!

20:18.070 --> 20:19.436
Mum's powers are returning,

20:19.472 --> 20:22.043
and it won't be long before
we can't contain them.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.679
I mean, she's already killed one person,

20:23.682 --> 20:26.249
and now the detective is on a...

20:26.301 --> 20:28.846
the detective is on her case.

20:28.881 --> 20:30.739
So, please, no discussion.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.083
- Mum has to go!
- (elevator bell dings)

20:33.119 --> 20:35.819
MAZE: She already has.

20:37.356 --> 20:39.123
Your mother's gone.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.725
What?

20:42.828 --> 20:44.828
MOM: It's Cheval something or other.

20:44.864 --> 20:47.731
It's valuable, so it must be good.

20:51.203 --> 20:53.627
I wasn't expecting to see you

20:53.630 --> 20:55.439
or your... (chuckles)

20:55.474 --> 20:57.775
deadly light back so soon.

20:57.810 --> 20:59.610
Well, something's been bothering me.

20:59.645 --> 21:02.346
When you first saw my wound...

21:02.381 --> 21:04.548
you asked if Lucifer had done it.

21:05.551 --> 21:07.017
What did you mean by that?

21:07.053 --> 21:08.552
I meant nothing by it.

21:08.587 --> 21:09.687
(chuckles): You know?

21:09.722 --> 21:11.889
Meaningless brain fart, you know?

21:11.924 --> 21:14.625
Just blah. Came out.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.660
There was a lot going on that day.

21:16.696 --> 21:18.362
Hmm.

21:18.397 --> 21:21.365
I don't think so.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.667
I think, in fact,

21:23.703 --> 21:25.602
that you know something.

21:25.638 --> 21:27.371
I don't want to hurt you, Linda.

21:27.406 --> 21:30.307
I... am running...

21:30.376 --> 21:32.276
out of time.

21:32.311 --> 21:35.079
You've seen what's happening to me.

21:35.114 --> 21:38.882
So you can either tell me what you know

21:38.918 --> 21:40.984
over a glass of wine

21:41.020 --> 21:45.522
or over your own charbroiled corpse.

21:45.558 --> 21:47.257
Your choice.

21:48.997 --> 21:52.083
I came here to grill
Kathleen on the false alibi.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.490
DAN: Whoa. Somebody already had, huh?

21:55.529 --> 21:56.781
Yeah.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.082
It's Ava Lyon.

21:58.118 --> 22:00.018
I'm thinking whoever killed Chet

22:00.053 --> 22:02.353
hired the Lyon sisters to clean up,

22:02.389 --> 22:03.788
then cleaned up the cleaner.

22:04.287 --> 22:05.857
Excuse me, what is going on?

22:05.859 --> 22:06.958
I work here.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.827
Ava!

22:09.863 --> 22:11.162
Stop.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.865
(crying): Oh, my God.

22:13.934 --> 22:15.967
What did I do?

22:16.002 --> 22:19.170
KATHLEEN: <i>It's me, only me.</i>

22:19.205 --> 22:21.506
Ava knew nothing about it.

22:22.753 --> 22:25.176
I wasn't lying about Brad.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.844
I did get back together with him,

22:26.880 --> 22:30.581
but he gambles a lot,
and he needed money.

22:30.617 --> 22:35.887
Then I got this call
offering me a hundred grand.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.558
Who hired you?

22:40.593 --> 22:42.794
Who killed Chet and your sister?

22:42.829 --> 22:46.197
Maybe Ava's death was a warning.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.599
For me to keep my mouth shut.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.868
Maybe if I don't say anything...

22:50.904 --> 22:53.104
(sighs)

22:56.042 --> 22:58.376
So how do we find Mom?

22:58.411 --> 23:00.979
Follow the trail of roasted humans?

23:01.014 --> 23:03.348
Well, if anyone can find
that wily goddess, it's Maze.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.550
- She's on it.
- (phone ringing)

23:07.854 --> 23:09.839
Detective. Everything all right?

23:09.867 --> 23:11.199
CHLOE: We found a body.

23:11.230 --> 23:12.557
- Another body?
- A burned head.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.359
- Same burned head?
- CHLOE: Yes.

23:14.394 --> 23:17.028
So, what, you think whoever
killed Chet killed again?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.896
Look, Lucifer, it's a long story,

23:18.932 --> 23:20.898
but the second victim is Ava Lyon.

23:20.934 --> 23:22.800
She's one of the cleaners we met.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.335
I have her sister Kathleen here,

23:24.371 --> 23:26.337
but she's not saying
anything... She's scared.

23:26.373 --> 23:27.972
So I need you to come here,

23:28.008 --> 23:30.074
and I need you to do your mojo thing.

23:30.110 --> 23:33.177
Yes, Detective, believe me when I say

23:33.213 --> 23:35.680
I want to find the
killer as much as you do.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.881
Hello, boys.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.116
Mum.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.617
What? What? What's going on?

23:39.652 --> 23:41.953
I-I'm so sorry. My mum's here.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.234
I-I've got to rush.

23:43.237 --> 23:45.857
Good luck with Kathleen. Ciao.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.225
Damn it.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.760
- What's wrong?
- Lucifer.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.161
He's...

23:50.196 --> 23:52.168
He's hiding something
from me, I can tell.

23:52.171 --> 23:54.899
Oh, you know what? It's probably
just embarrassing family stuff.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.801
I mean, they seem totally bonkers.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.036
Yeah.

23:58.071 --> 23:59.404
Maybe.

23:59.439 --> 24:03.274
He is with his step-mom now, so...

24:03.309 --> 24:05.442
So maybe...

24:05.497 --> 24:08.379
maybe he's not hiding <i>something</i> from me,

24:08.415 --> 24:09.747
but <i> someone.</i>

24:09.783 --> 24:12.950
Someone who knew Chet.

24:12.986 --> 24:15.315
And someone I still don't trust.

24:15.318 --> 24:17.088
AMENADIEL: What have you been doing?

24:17.090 --> 24:19.457
Oh... this and that.

24:19.492 --> 24:22.193
<i>This</i> being firing
up the celestial barbecue

24:22.228 --> 24:24.695
so <i> that</i> you can grill another head?

24:24.731 --> 24:27.065
No. I just needed to get cleaned up.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.800
Get some air.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.768
I was feeling a little claustrophobic.

24:30.804 --> 24:34.639
Don't you just hate
being kept in the dark?

24:36.820 --> 24:39.844
The good news is you found Amenadiel.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.880
So we have the piece?

24:42.916 --> 24:45.883
Yes. Well, interesting story, actually.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.385
Why don't you tell her, Brother?

24:47.420 --> 24:49.387
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no. This one's all you.

24:49.422 --> 24:51.289
Brother, I insist.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.392
- Thank you.
- (chuckles softly)

24:54.461 --> 24:55.827
Right. Well, uh,

24:55.862 --> 24:57.295
upon careful consideration,

24:57.330 --> 24:59.297
we've decided this
whole Flaming Sword plan

24:59.332 --> 25:00.465
is a crap idea.

25:00.533 --> 25:01.699
Yes, crap.

25:01.734 --> 25:02.854
Mm. Have you ever considered

25:02.869 --> 25:04.969
finding, well, I don't know,

25:05.004 --> 25:06.237
a-a place of your own?

25:06.272 --> 25:08.673
Yeah. Somewhere away from Dad, maybe?

25:08.708 --> 25:09.640
Yes.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.342
LUCIFER: Somewhere familiar,

25:11.377 --> 25:13.065
warmer, perhaps?

25:15.315 --> 25:18.583
You want... you want me back in Hell?

25:18.618 --> 25:20.384
Well, not <i> in</i> Hell, per se,

25:20.420 --> 25:21.686
but in charge of Hell.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.521
I mean, after all, it is a kingdom

25:23.556 --> 25:24.922
without a ruler.

25:24.958 --> 25:26.078
He is right.

25:26.081 --> 25:28.559
I mean, there's a great
opportunity for upward mobility.

25:28.595 --> 25:31.114
Lick of paint here or there.

25:31.153 --> 25:32.763
The columns would look great in white.

25:34.501 --> 25:36.634
Beige?

25:38.761 --> 25:40.694
(chuckles softly)

25:40.740 --> 25:42.373
So it's true.

25:42.408 --> 25:45.143
You <i> are</i> working against me.

25:45.178 --> 25:50.348
You never planned on
going with me to Heaven.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.516
Wait.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.518
How did you find out?

25:53.553 --> 25:56.988
Well, I persuaded...

25:57.023 --> 25:58.923
your little doctor.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.092
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.560
What did you do?

26:03.730 --> 26:05.263
Mum.

26:05.298 --> 26:06.497
AMENADIEL: Mom.

26:06.533 --> 26:07.965
Listen, I understand.

26:08.001 --> 26:09.200
You're angry.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.703
Oh, I'm not angry.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.195
Just disappointed.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.742
(Lucifer and Amenadiel grunt)

26:23.249 --> 26:24.682
(groaning)

26:26.819 --> 26:28.953
Give me the piece!

26:28.988 --> 26:30.488
No, Mom.

26:32.325 --> 26:34.258
You're gonna have to kill me.

26:39.136 --> 26:42.579
Guess I'll have to find
another way, won't I?

26:47.057 --> 26:49.243
Well, now look what you've made her do.

26:49.284 --> 26:50.652
I've just had this tuned!

26:50.687 --> 26:54.589
Me? How about you suggesting Hell

26:54.625 --> 26:57.025
as a retirement home? Nice.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.093
Maybe if you had just

26:58.128 --> 26:59.494
mentioned the pottery class

26:59.529 --> 27:02.364
or water aerobics, she
would have gone for it.

27:02.399 --> 27:03.965
Oh, and did you have a better idea?

27:04.001 --> 27:06.968
Mom's coming undone, Luci.

27:08.605 --> 27:10.271
- In every way.
- I know.

27:10.307 --> 27:12.540
And she doesn't care
who she hurts anymore.

27:12.576 --> 27:14.042
Linda.

27:14.077 --> 27:15.343
I'll go check on Linda.

27:15.379 --> 27:17.278
You go after Mom, she'll listen to you.

27:17.314 --> 27:19.347
But, Luci, don't you dare
promise her that piece,

27:19.383 --> 27:21.082
because I won't give it to her.

27:26.189 --> 27:29.491
♪ ♪

27:36.033 --> 27:38.557
Well, well. Someone's clever.

27:38.588 --> 27:40.368
How did you get me?

27:40.404 --> 27:42.537
Wasn't that hard. We tracked your phone.

27:42.572 --> 27:46.374
No, I mean, how did you
figure out I was the bad guy?

27:46.410 --> 27:49.010
Did Little Miss Dandy Lyon tell you?

27:49.046 --> 27:50.812
It's over, Charlotte. Put your hands up.

27:50.847 --> 27:52.547
Oh, don't worry, I'm
not going to resist.

27:52.582 --> 27:54.816
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

27:54.851 --> 27:57.285
I just have one small request.

27:59.956 --> 28:02.057
(phone ringing)

28:02.092 --> 28:03.758
Detective.

28:03.794 --> 28:05.160
Any chance you've seen my Mu...

28:05.195 --> 28:06.728
MOM: Looking for little ol' me?

28:06.763 --> 28:07.762
You were right, dear.

28:07.798 --> 28:10.565
Your detective is quite good.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.033
(Mom chuckles)

28:12.069 --> 28:13.334
(whispers): She caught me.

28:13.370 --> 28:14.402
Where are you?

28:14.438 --> 28:15.637
Santa Monica Pier.

28:15.672 --> 28:17.458
Such a beautiful place.

28:17.489 --> 28:19.140
So many people.

28:19.176 --> 28:21.481
If you hurt anyone, Mum,

28:21.505 --> 28:22.610
if you hurt her...

28:22.646 --> 28:25.246
And if you and your brother
had just given me what I needed.

28:25.282 --> 28:26.614
But who knows?

28:26.650 --> 28:28.016
Maybe you still can.

28:28.985 --> 28:30.218
Okay, that's enough.

28:30.253 --> 28:32.187
Mum!

28:32.947 --> 28:34.155
Start talking.

28:34.199 --> 28:36.733
Just the two of us.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.159
If that's all right.

28:38.195 --> 28:41.062
I'd rather not put Daniel in...

28:41.098 --> 28:42.530
an awkward position.

28:43.767 --> 28:46.668
Hate to ruin all the
good ones we've been in.

28:46.703 --> 28:48.136
(clears throat)

28:48.171 --> 28:49.471
Can we go outside?

28:49.506 --> 28:50.772
Mm-hmm.

28:50.807 --> 28:52.500
I'll be fine.

29:02.419 --> 29:04.652
I'll miss you, Daniel.

29:04.688 --> 29:07.322
You are my favorite human.

29:12.562 --> 29:14.095
(phone ringing)

29:14.131 --> 29:15.530
Hey. You find Mom?

29:15.565 --> 29:18.266
She's on Santa Monica Pier,
and she wants the piece.

29:18.301 --> 29:20.301
(horn honks, tires screech)

29:20.337 --> 29:22.537
We have to give it to her, Amenadiel.

29:22.572 --> 29:24.038
We've run out of options.

29:24.074 --> 29:25.333
Please.

29:25.365 --> 29:27.175
Brother, please.

29:27.210 --> 29:30.255
She... she has Chloe.

29:34.885 --> 29:36.951
Linda! You here?!

29:36.987 --> 29:38.853
I'm tracking Lucifer's mom,

29:38.889 --> 29:41.823
and I think she might be on her way.

29:44.594 --> 29:46.828
(groans weakly)

29:46.863 --> 29:48.363
Oh, no.

29:48.398 --> 29:50.999
No, no, no!

29:54.671 --> 29:56.604
Linda.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.439
Hey. It's okay.

29:58.475 --> 30:00.475
I'm here. Okay?

30:00.510 --> 30:01.976
You're gonna be fine.

30:04.714 --> 30:07.115
She did this to you, didn't she?

30:07.150 --> 30:10.785
(crying): She wanted to know
what Lucifer's plans were.

30:10.821 --> 30:12.787
I didn't want to tell her.

30:12.823 --> 30:14.989
I tried to resist. I'm so sorry.

30:15.025 --> 30:17.025
It's not your fault, okay?

30:17.060 --> 30:19.194
And you're going to be fine.

30:19.229 --> 30:20.662
I promise.

30:20.697 --> 30:22.197
I'm-I'm gonna fix you.

30:22.232 --> 30:23.832
Okay?

30:29.406 --> 30:30.839
(crying): Help me.

30:32.943 --> 30:35.143
Hello, Daniel.

30:35.178 --> 30:36.110
Whoa!

30:36.146 --> 30:37.498
Whoa, whoa!

30:37.501 --> 30:39.045
She kissed me.

30:39.048 --> 30:40.481
Literally no idea what
you're talking about.

30:40.483 --> 30:41.449
Just get your hands up.

30:41.484 --> 30:42.550
No, don't be silly.

30:42.586 --> 30:43.985
I'm not gonna stab you.

30:44.020 --> 30:45.286
I'm just looking for something.

30:45.322 --> 30:47.322
Come on, up. Up!

30:50.293 --> 30:52.060
What are you looking for?

30:52.095 --> 30:53.194
Uh...

30:53.230 --> 30:54.963
- Hello.
- Whoa.

30:54.998 --> 30:56.731
What the...?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:58.768 --> 31:00.201
Ah.

31:00.237 --> 31:01.536
Ah-ah-ah. It's my brother's.

31:01.571 --> 31:04.005
He left it there for
safekeeping, so thanks for that.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.673
You're a lifesaver.

31:05.709 --> 31:07.475
Okay, Charlotte, this
has been a great chat,

31:07.510 --> 31:09.310
but are you gonna confess or what?

31:09.346 --> 31:11.279
I'll never understand
why you concern yourselves

31:11.314 --> 31:14.616
with one little human, but... fine.

31:14.651 --> 31:16.818
Yes, I was involved in Chet's death,

31:16.853 --> 31:19.053
but not in the way you think.

31:19.089 --> 31:21.022
Well, correct me if I'm
wrong. You killed him.

31:21.057 --> 31:23.358
You hired a cleaner to
take care of the body.

31:23.393 --> 31:24.673
And then you killed the cleaner.

31:24.694 --> 31:26.060
Is that it?

31:26.096 --> 31:27.428
The cleaner's dead?

31:27.464 --> 31:28.529
(quietly): What?

31:28.565 --> 31:30.031
Oh, that's unfortunate.

31:30.066 --> 31:32.533
I certainly had nothing to do with that.

31:32.569 --> 31:35.069
But if you didn't, then who did?

31:35.105 --> 31:36.204
LUCIFER: Mom!

31:37.662 --> 31:38.806
I've got it.

31:38.842 --> 31:40.615
Now let the detective go.

31:40.638 --> 31:41.309
Lucifer,

31:41.344 --> 31:42.677
put down the knife.

31:42.712 --> 31:44.612
You can't protect your mother anymore.

31:44.681 --> 31:46.180
I'm not protecting her.

31:46.216 --> 31:47.815
It's you I'm trying to save.

31:47.851 --> 31:49.684
Now, here it is, Mum.

31:49.719 --> 31:52.620
I have the blade and the final piece.

31:52.656 --> 31:55.990
You let the detective go,
and they are yours.

31:56.026 --> 31:57.592
CHLOE: Let me go? Really?

31:57.627 --> 31:58.782
I'm the one holding her.

31:58.785 --> 32:00.647
- Mum?
- MAN: No one's going anywhere!

32:00.650 --> 32:01.863
(crowd gasping)

32:01.898 --> 32:04.332
Oh, I think we found our mystery killer.

32:04.367 --> 32:06.367
How can you be so glib?!

32:06.436 --> 32:07.702
You were our lawyer!

32:07.737 --> 32:09.037
You betrayed us!

32:09.072 --> 32:10.238
Put the gun down, Hector.

32:10.273 --> 32:12.667
HECTOR: Thank you for
leading me to her, Detective.

32:12.670 --> 32:15.410
You promised to approach
this fairly, and you did.

32:15.445 --> 32:17.612
But now I have to make
things right for my family.

32:17.647 --> 32:18.646
LUCIFER: Ah!

32:18.682 --> 32:20.315
A little wrinkle.

32:20.350 --> 32:21.482
You shoot her

32:21.518 --> 32:23.217
and we're all dead, okay?

32:25.055 --> 32:26.854
I need a hospital.

32:26.890 --> 32:28.356
Yes.

32:28.391 --> 32:29.557
Okay.

32:29.592 --> 32:31.526
It's too far, Maze.

32:31.561 --> 32:33.293
She won't make it.

32:34.064 --> 32:36.264
We need to do something.

32:37.567 --> 32:39.334
We need more time.

32:39.369 --> 32:42.003
We just need more time.

32:53.383 --> 32:55.750
What are you doing?

32:55.785 --> 32:58.353
Look, it's very difficult to explain,

32:58.388 --> 33:00.154
but believe me when I say

33:00.190 --> 33:03.194
that there are many,
many lives at stake here.

33:03.210 --> 33:07.095
So, please, just put the gun down, huh?

34:11.795 --> 34:14.328

34:19.315 --> 34:22.494
You've hurt so many

34:22.530 --> 34:25.179
You know that everything I've
done, I've done for, for us,

34:25.181 --> 34:26.237
for our family.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.150
You used me.

34:28.186 --> 34:29.851
Used Chloe.

34:31.556 --> 34:33.022

He created Chloe just to manipulate you.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.728
Lucifer, look.

34:39.764 --> 34:41.563
We have the sword.

34:41.599 --> 34:45.333
Finally, finally, we can get revenge.

34:45.369 --> 34:48.036
We can destroy him.

34:48.072 --> 34:49.678
We can take our home back.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.476
Okay.

34:53.511 --> 34:55.811
I can take care of it for both of us.

34:55.847 --> 35:00.883
Just give me the sword,
and I'll do the rest.

35:02.902 --> 35:05.069
Please, son. I just...

35:05.089 --> 35:08.657
I just want a chance to start over.

35:08.693 --> 35:12.228
But... going home?

35:14.283 --> 35:16.832
That's not starting over, that's...

35:16.868 --> 35:18.901

never see you again.

39:17.969 --> 39:19.758
that Hector killed both victims.

killed his own brother?

40:38.322 --> 40:41.857
I walked into this
with my eyes wide open,

40:41.892 --> 40:44.993
chose to be your friend

40:45.029 --> 40:47.696
and face all that comes with that.

40:47.731 --> 40:49.164
The good,

40:49.200 --> 40:51.200
the bad and the crispy.

40:53.537 --> 40:55.571
What?

40:55.606 --> 40:59.975
I just realized something
that I need to do.

41:00.736 --> 41:04.880
But... let's focus on you, shall we?

41:04.915 --> 41:07.783
That's enough about me.

41:12.823 --> 41:16.058
LUCIFER: Detective. Hello, it's me.

41:16.093 --> 41:18.093
Lucifer.

41:18.128 --> 41:20.863
Um, I just wanted to apologize

41:20.898 --> 41:24.566
for being, well, for being so elusive.

41:24.602 --> 41:28.937
But I also wanted to say
that I am done hiding.

41:28.973 --> 41:33.275
So I'm coming over now to
tell you the truth about me.

41:33.310 --> 41:36.144
'Cause I think it's time
I finally opened your eyes

41:36.180 --> 41:40.716
as to why strange things
sometimes happen around me.

41:40.751 --> 41:44.426
Why my brother's so saintly
and Maze is so... not.

41:44.429 --> 41:45.562
(chuckles)

41:45.565 --> 41:48.757
And I'm so... well, magnetic.

41:50.494 --> 41:52.728
No, but s-seriously, I...

41:52.763 --> 41:55.831
I want to tell you everything.

41:55.866 --> 41:58.734
No more going backwards.
