language and some violent scenes

00:07.680 --> 00:11.136
Doctor Bahil is adamant she wants to
 travel into the Kowt-e 'Ashro
region tomorrow.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.376
She's gone! They've got her.
My death will be justified.

00:13.376 --> 00:18.240
Omar was luring British soldiers
in to that building to kill them.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.544
I don't mind what you're telling
people, right.

00:20.544 --> 00:21.952
What do I tell people?

00:21.952 --> 00:23.744
I thought you said
your mum was a teacher?

00:23.744 --> 00:27.200
If she's not a midwife,
you need to say.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.452
Dr Bahil rescued alive.

00:29.452 --> 00:33.664

Get this off him.

01:40.928 --> 01:42.532
Oscar to Zero, do you read, please?

01:42.532 --> 01:44.452
Am I bleeding out?
No! No.

01:44.452 --> 01:45.600
Bleeding nuisance.

fine, aren't you, Fingers, hey?

01:48.864 --> 01:53.092
Oh, jeez.

01:53.092 --> 01:55.264
Georgie, is it bad?

01:55.264 --> 01:56.812
No. No, it's not bad.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.784
What's up with you?
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:58.784 --> 02:01.024
Calm down. All right. Calm down.

02:01.024 --> 02:03.652
Get me a pack.

02:03.652 --> 02:06.292
Is he going to be all right, Monk?
Let's just do what we've got to do.

FINGERS YELLS

02:20.736 --> 02:23.936
Not with a possible chest injury.
No.Oscar to Zero. Do you read
please?

02:23.936 --> 02:25.792
How's he doing, Sergeant Lane?

02:25.792 --> 02:28.544
He's all right. He's fine. Tell him.
           Fine, mate.

02:28.544 --> 02:31.936
I'm going to make that plane in
the morning! Don't worry about that.

02:31.936 --> 02:34.496
How long by road, Colour?
No, no, no.

02:34.496 --> 02:37.184
There's no way we're going to get
him all the way back by road, sir.

02:37.184 --> 02:39.616
He'll bleed out.

02:39.616 --> 02:42.496
Colour, what do we do?We carry on
until we can establish comms

02:42.496 --> 02:45.440

hellhole, sir.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.528

Come on. Let's focus.

02:56.452 --> 02:58.132
Yo, Monk.

02:58.132 --> 03:00.292
4x4 in the distance...

03:00.292 --> 03:03.616
..and a moped.

03:03.616 --> 03:06.816
Any sign of weapons?
They're gaining on us!

03:06.816 --> 03:09.772
Shit.They're getting closer! Look.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.812
Let's just go out there
and take them out, yeah?

03:11.812 --> 03:13.856
Do not engage.Georgie.

03:13.856 --> 03:17.092
First round fired and they'll
be on us from every direction.

03:17.092 --> 03:19.808
No, man.
Keep your eyes on the rear.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.536

you?

03:21.536 --> 03:24.652

Well, stop talking, then.

03:29.812 --> 03:31.852
The blood pressure's
dropping, Georgie.

03:31.852 --> 03:35.296
Don't sugar coat this.
Hey! Listen...

03:35.296 --> 03:38.496

03:44.384 --> 03:48.480
What the hell is this, Kingy?

03:48.480 --> 03:51.936
Bollocks.What's happened?
Why have we stopped?

03:51.936 --> 03:54.176
Farm vehicles blocking both roads.

03:54.176 --> 03:57.184
Oscar to Zero, do you read, please?
They've got weapons!

03:57.184 --> 03:59.616

They could be IED-ed.

04:38.464 --> 04:41.092
And there's that little matter
of a rocket launcher at our rear.

04:41.092 --> 04:42.688
Is it on?Yeah.Right. I
need to get him up.

04:42.688 --> 04:44.352

What do you think? Taliban?
Might regret letting them go, boss.

05:52.012 --> 05:55.648
We'll regret it even more
if they turn out to be farmers.

05:55.648 --> 05:58.528

08:37.012 --> 08:38.336

08:40.132 --> 08:41.280
Where's Georgie?

08:41.280 --> 08:43.584
The comms have been down.
Couldn't get hold of them.

08:43.584 --> 08:44.864
But where are they?

08:44.864 --> 08:47.936
They were the support
group for Special Forces.

08:47.936 --> 08:49.664
Looking for you.

08:49.664 --> 08:52.544
That whole area is enemy territory.

08:52.544 --> 08:57.052
Go!

Doctor! Please!

08:59.968 --> 09:02.144
Georgie!

09:02.144 --> 09:04.132
I've got Antonio on the wire.

09:04.132 --> 09:06.240
It's all right, Fingers!
We've got a line now.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.372
We've got a line.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.608
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

09:08.608 --> 09:10.492
Lane, Antonio.Yeah. One man down.

09:10.492 --> 09:13.024
Cat A. Gunshot wound.Where?

09:13.024 --> 09:15.532
Right side of the chest.
There's an exit wound.

09:15.532 --> 09:17.760
We did our best to contain the bleed
but he's...

09:17.760 --> 09:19.492
His pulse is weak.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.216
Yeah, and he's struggling
to breathe.

09:21.216 --> 09:23.008
I feel like I'm losing him.

09:23.008 --> 09:24.772
Describe his breathing, Georgie.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.808
One second.Shallow?

09:27.808 --> 09:29.092
Yeah.

09:29.092 --> 09:30.944
Yeah, he's breathing shallow, yeah.

09:30.944 --> 09:32.608
All right. If he's
struggling to breathe,

09:32.608 --> 09:34.492
the bullet must have
penetrated the lung.

09:34.492 --> 09:36.772
We're looking at a possible
hemopneumothorax.Yeah.

09:36.772 --> 09:38.176
I think you're right.

09:38.176 --> 09:40.544
I need to release the air.
I've done it before.

09:40.544 --> 09:41.952
Great.Right. I need a syringe.

09:41.952 --> 09:43.616
Syringe.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.472
Make sure he's lying flat.

09:45.472 --> 09:46.816
Yeah, he's lying flat.

10:07.872 --> 10:09.536
Make that one now, Monk.

10:09.536 --> 10:12.416
What the hell are we doing about
getting out to them? There's
incoming!

10:12.416 --> 10:14.932
We can't get the helicopters that

10:14.932 --> 10:17.664

10:25.792 --> 10:27.904
You need a steady hand for
this, Georgie, OK?

10:27.904 --> 10:30.912
So take your time.

10:30.912 --> 10:33.088
They can't get the helicopter
any closer.

10:33.088 --> 10:34.944
Chance of getting to the RV point?

10:34.944 --> 10:36.352
We've got one Cat A.

10:36.352 --> 10:38.400
Not sure we can stretcher him
over the mountains.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.192
Think the movement will be too much.

10:40.192 --> 10:41.728
Blue! 10 o'clock.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.096
Bandits approaching.

10:44.096 --> 10:46.976
Hold your fire, guys. White flag.

10:46.976 --> 10:48.772
Look! We need to take them out.

10:48.772 --> 10:51.412
Hold your fucking fire.

10:51.412 --> 10:56.704
What?

10:56.704 --> 10:59.932
You're surrounded. Give us Omar
and we'll let you through.

10:59.932 --> 11:01.440
Listen, fella!

11:01.440 --> 11:04.012
We can put a bullet in Omar's
brain right now.

11:04.012 --> 11:07.072
Give us Omar or we'll kill you all.

11:07.072 --> 11:09.568
We have plenty of men
and many bullets.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.424
No way we're giving them Omar.

11:11.424 --> 11:13.664
We're not in a strong bargaining
position here.

11:13.664 --> 11:24.096
Let's move. Monk.

11:24.096 --> 11:28.256
I think we're going to have to do
a deal here, boys.

11:28.256 --> 11:32.864
Hold me weapon.

11:32.864 --> 11:37.152
Move your vehicles, give us safe
passage to our onward transport...

11:37.152 --> 11:39.532
..and we'll give you Omar.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.932
I give you my word as an Englishman.

11:41.932 --> 11:43.168
And a Welshman.

11:43.168 --> 11:45.024
And a Scot.

11:45.024 --> 11:50.976
Show us Omar and we have deal.

11:50.976 --> 11:55.012
Let's hope he's still alive.

11:55.012 --> 11:56.608
Talk to me, Lane.

11:56.608 --> 11:58.656
So I'm going to insert the needle,
sir.

11:58.656 --> 12:02.496
At a 90 degree angle, in the space
between the second and the third
rib.

12:02.496 --> 12:06.720
In one motion, Georgie, OK?
And you've got to push it in hard.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.000
OK, Roger that.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.012
Inserting the needle now.

12:10.012 --> 12:11.264
Hard, Georgie.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.652
CRUNCH

12:12.652 --> 12:14.976
Yes!

12:14.976 --> 12:16.512
FINGERS BREATHES HEAVILY

12:16.512 --> 12:17.984
What's happening, Georgie?

12:17.984 --> 12:19.904
He's breathing. He's breathing.

12:19.904 --> 12:23.812
OK. Remove the needle and
leave the IV cannula sheet inside

12:23.812 --> 12:25.856
and tell me how his breathing is.
It's less shallow.

12:25.856 --> 12:29.572
Pulse returning to normal.
Stop worrying me, you bellend.

12:29.572 --> 12:33.344
Prep IV.
I need him on that MERT, sir.

12:33.344 --> 12:45.772
Out you come, Sugar Tits.

12:45.772 --> 12:49.344
We'll meet again.

12:49.344 --> 12:57.728
Come on.

12:57.728 --> 13:00.772
We need to evacuate our injured
comrade.

13:00.772 --> 13:05.472
Move your vehicles, let us
through...

13:05.472 --> 13:08.572
..and we'll give you Omar back.

13:08.572 --> 13:15.292
What is he playing at?

13:15.292 --> 13:17.056
Right, lads, load up.

13:17.056 --> 13:33.892
Let's move.
In to the vehicles now.

13:33.892 --> 13:35.744
Span out, Mimi. On
his face. On three.

13:35.744 --> 13:39.292
One, two... FINGERS YELLS

13:39.292 --> 13:42.172
Let's bandage.
Keep breathing, Fingers.

13:42.172 --> 13:54.944
We need to make room, OK?

13:54.944 --> 13:57.892
Georgie.

13:57.892 --> 14:03.172
Thank you. Thank you, Georgie Lane.

14:03.172 --> 14:05.248
I'm sorry.Eh.

14:05.248 --> 14:07.104
Shut it...

14:07.104 --> 14:09.216
..you big Doris.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.732
Listen!

14:10.732 --> 14:12.864
I'm getting you home.

14:12.864 --> 14:23.812
OK.

14:23.812 --> 14:32.000
OK. You have arrived
at your destination.

14:32.000 --> 14:45.824
Zero. 3 minutes to RV point.

14:45.824 --> 14:47.232
They've got him, Colour.

14:47.232 --> 14:51.328
Put your foot down.

14:51.328 --> 14:52.992
Looks like this mountain path stops

14:52.992 --> 14:55.296
so we're going to have to foot
the last half a kilometre.

14:55.296 --> 14:57.412
We can't do that.
We need to keep him level.

14:57.412 --> 14:59.392
We can all just carry
the stretcher together

14:59.392 --> 15:02.212
and keep it steady as possible.
We're getting him back alive, Prof.

15:02.212 --> 15:04.064
Too fucking right, we are.

15:04.064 --> 15:07.328
Right that's it. Everybody out.
We're on foot.

15:07.328 --> 15:10.208
Right. Put him down. Watch his head.
Watch his head. Watch his head.

15:10.208 --> 15:13.856
Watch his head! Right, keep it
still. One, two, three.

15:13.856 --> 15:16.864
Right, two Section. Move. On me.

15:16.864 --> 15:18.720
Zero, I have eyes on two section.

15:18.720 --> 15:28.896
Come on, you lot. Move!

15:28.896 --> 15:38.048
CLAMOUR IN OWN LANGUAGE

15:38.048 --> 15:39.532
Shit! Fuck's sake!

15:39.532 --> 15:41.248
Fucking concentrate!

15:41.248 --> 15:43.744
If you drop him.
I will never forgive you.

15:43.744 --> 15:49.184
Any of you.

15:49.184 --> 16:02.572
Move in.

16:02.572 --> 16:05.056
Mate, we're there now. Don't you be
going to sleep on my watch.

16:05.056 --> 16:07.424
We're right there. We're going to
make it! Come on, Fingers.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.752
Look, you're here now.Let's get him
   in. Move, team! Move, team.

16:10.752 --> 16:16.576
ALL TALK AT ONCE

16:16.576 --> 16:17.856
You motherf...

16:17.856 --> 16:21.568
Let me go! Get off me! Let me go!

16:21.568 --> 16:23.744
Calm yourself! Calm down.

16:23.744 --> 16:27.776
Get on the chopper now.
All right.Get on.

16:27.776 --> 16:30.016
Air to the chest,
no exit wound.

16:30.016 --> 16:33.984
Pulse is very erratic. He's
conscious. He's breathing.

16:33.984 --> 16:36.292
We need blood.

16:36.292 --> 16:38.528
Medic, you keep my boy alive.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.576
You've got this medic!
We've got to go.

16:40.576 --> 16:44.416
Hold on! Hold on!
We've got three of our guys
still coming.

16:44.416 --> 16:47.692
You're going to be all right.
OK? Keep focused.

16:47.692 --> 16:49.732
We've got to move, guys!

16:49.732 --> 16:51.292
We're not going anywhere yet.

16:51.292 --> 16:54.656
Colour! Eyes on.

16:54.656 --> 16:59.932
Where the hell, are they?
No-one there yet.

16:59.932 --> 17:02.848
Get him up.Come on. I've been
carrying you since selection, boy!

17:02.848 --> 17:04.576
Don't you die on me now.

17:04.576 --> 17:06.412
Wait!

17:06.412 --> 17:13.492
Eyes on. Eyes on.Get hold
of him.Grab him.

17:13.492 --> 17:17.696
Can you hear me, Fingers? It's going
to be all right. All right?

17:17.696 --> 17:21.600
Blue! Blue! Get in.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.864
Got this.

17:24.864 --> 17:26.976
Shot, Colour.Oh, shit.

17:26.976 --> 17:31.972
Let's get out of here.Let's
go. Let's go! Let's go!

17:31.972 --> 17:39.584
Hey, don't go to sleep on me.
Stay awake.

17:39.584 --> 17:40.972
You're all right, Fingers.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.296
We've got you now, yeah?
You're here.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.768
You're going to be all right.

17:44.768 --> 17:50.932
You're going to be fine.
We've got you. Go on. Get him in.

17:50.932 --> 17:53.984
Oh, my God.
We got him here alive.

17:53.984 --> 17:56.572
You got him here, Georgie.Yeah.
You got him here.

17:56.572 --> 17:58.976
He's going to be all right?
Yeah.

17:58.976 --> 18:01.024
Now, you go take care
of yourself. OK?

18:01.024 --> 18:04.612
He's in good hands.

18:04.612 --> 18:07.132
Thank you.

18:07.132 --> 18:09.172
All right, guys.
Let's do a primary survey.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.008
His tension has been decompressed.

18:11.008 --> 18:14.812
We need to put in a chest drain.
Let's get some blood in to him.

18:14.812 --> 18:17.600
We need two large port cannulas.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.776
Gentlemen. Seat of pants.

18:19.776 --> 18:21.312
But at the end of the day,

18:21.312 --> 18:24.064
hostage rescued and target captured.

18:24.064 --> 18:25.920
History will say we did well.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.224
One Cat A and a few close calls,
sir.

18:28.224 --> 18:31.616
I guess the chaps will have a good
after-dinner story to tell.

18:31.616 --> 18:32.704
Well...

18:32.704 --> 18:36.608
..all very worthwhile then, sir.

18:36.608 --> 18:40.256
Shame we had to leave behind
a £2 million bit of kit.

18:40.256 --> 18:46.732
Hey, ho. Thank you, Sergeant.

18:46.732 --> 18:48.576
Well done, Mr Hurst.

18:48.576 --> 18:50.752
Could you shut my door, please?

18:50.752 --> 18:59.932
Wind picking up.

18:59.932 --> 19:05.984
"Forward, he cried, from the rear."

19:05.984 --> 19:09.056
Look after yourself, you Welsh tart.

19:09.056 --> 19:10.464
See ya.

19:10.464 --> 19:11.936
You all right? What's happening?

19:11.936 --> 19:14.944
Waiting for my work-shy
homie to man up.

19:14.944 --> 19:16.492
He got lucky.

19:16.492 --> 19:18.016
Muscle and flesh damage.

19:18.016 --> 19:21.412
Few weeks off and he'll
be in a ditch somewhere near you!

19:21.412 --> 19:24.544
He loves me really.

19:24.544 --> 19:27.296
Did we get medical assistance for
Mrs Aarush?

19:27.296 --> 19:29.572
Mother and baby doing well, I hear.

19:29.572 --> 19:31.264
Not so the husband.

19:31.264 --> 19:33.184
He was in the back of the truck.

19:33.184 --> 19:36.704
What, that exploded?Aye.Oh, shit.

19:36.704 --> 19:40.972
When...

19:40.972 --> 19:45.216
When you stayed behind
and we went to the RV point...

19:45.216 --> 19:50.336
..did you think you were
going to make it?

19:50.336 --> 19:54.892
No.

19:54.892 --> 19:58.852
You were willing to make
the ultimate sacrifice.

19:58.852 --> 20:03.412
Like Elvis.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.824
Get some sleep, yeah?

20:05.824 --> 20:09.344
Omar's currently being
guarded by several hundred Yanks

20:09.344 --> 20:11.392
and your man, he's...

20:11.392 --> 20:13.440
He's in the best possible hands.

20:13.440 --> 20:25.408
Thank you.

20:25.408 --> 20:28.800
How far is it to the moon
and back, do you reckon?

20:28.800 --> 20:30.412
I'm just saying, you know, because

20:30.412 --> 20:31.872
that's what people say, don't they?

20:31.872 --> 20:34.752
Love you to the moon and back.

20:34.752 --> 20:38.212
But surely it's not as far
as Mars or...?

20:38.212 --> 20:40.704
That's infinity, innit?
I don't know.

20:40.704 --> 20:44.544
I wish I'd listened in school.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.976
My biology teacher, yeah, told me

20:46.976 --> 20:48.576
that when you have sex,

20:48.576 --> 20:50.816
the bollock yoghurt

20:50.816 --> 20:52.992
comes out of the right testicle

20:52.992 --> 20:54.720
whereas if you do it yourself,

20:54.720 --> 20:56.332
it comes out of the left.

20:56.332 --> 20:59.332
One of yours must come back looking
like a raisin and the other one
a melon!

20:59.332 --> 21:02.144
Boy, I'm telling you,
I tested it every 20 minutes.

21:02.144 --> 21:04.064
Is that what your teacher told you,
Throbber?

21:04.064 --> 21:09.312
He's a bit cruel, isn't he?She.

21:09.312 --> 21:12.412
This is so much better than going
out on the lash.

21:12.412 --> 21:17.376
You lot do realise that we will
remember today for, like...

21:17.376 --> 21:20.384
Well, always, actually.

21:20.384 --> 21:22.688
Even when we're 100, you know?

21:22.688 --> 21:25.612
Well done, today, Mimi.
Delivering a baby.

21:25.612 --> 21:28.064
Some real downstairs action, gal!

21:28.064 --> 21:30.892
Yeah, well, her mum does that
stuff for a living so it's...

21:30.892 --> 21:35.040
It's kind of like cheating, innit,
Mimi?

21:35.040 --> 21:37.732
Hey! Here he is.

21:37.732 --> 21:40.416
The man that saved Special Forces.

21:40.416 --> 21:42.016
All right. OK.

21:42.016 --> 21:44.256
All right. Look. This ain't
an episode of Long Lost Family

21:44.256 --> 21:46.560
so let's all cut the clapping
bollocks, all right?

21:46.560 --> 21:48.292
How's Fingers, Colour?

21:48.292 --> 21:49.888
Still in surgery,
so I need you all

21:49.888 --> 21:52.768
cracking on with your after-action
reports in the morning.

21:52.768 --> 21:56.864
Then normal duties resume.
ALL:Colour.

21:56.864 --> 21:59.872
Here you are, Prof.

21:59.872 --> 22:07.424
THEY CHATTER

22:07.424 --> 22:10.880
We struggled to access the injury
the bullet caused.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.888
He'll need more
surgery in the next 24 hours.Again?

22:13.888 --> 22:15.488
We've achieved haemostasis

22:15.488 --> 22:19.264
but it's only a
temporary solution, Georgie.

22:19.264 --> 22:21.056
One thing's for sure, though -

22:21.056 --> 22:24.000
he's a fighter.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.264
Come on.
Go get some rest, OK?

22:27.264 --> 22:34.012
There's nothing
more you can do here.

22:34.012 --> 22:40.972
I'm going nowhere.

22:40.972 --> 22:43.584
DOOR CLOSES

22:43.584 --> 23:23.212
MUSIC: This is the Walk
by David O'Dowda.

23:23.212 --> 23:26.592
Georgie?

23:26.592 --> 23:28.972
You all right?Yeah.

23:28.972 --> 23:31.648
I brought you some scoff.
Oh, no. I'm fine.

23:31.648 --> 23:36.832
It's a cheese omelette.
Get it down you.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.584
You all right?Is it cheese?

23:39.584 --> 23:40.736
Er, it's goat's cheese.

23:40.736 --> 23:43.852
We do get it in Manchester,
you know.Do we?

23:43.852 --> 23:46.048
Maybe not in Stockport.

23:46.048 --> 23:48.096
We've just got brown bread.

23:48.096 --> 23:51.652
BEEPING

23:51.652 --> 23:54.052
What's going on? What's going on?

23:54.052 --> 23:56.692
Antonio? Antonio? What's going on?

23:56.692 --> 23:59.168
Fingers? Fingers?

23:59.168 --> 24:01.984
He's VF.Fingers?
We need to shock him.Oh, shit!

24:01.984 --> 24:03.840
MUFFLED: Oh, no, no, no!
Charging, 200 joules.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.208
Fingers!200J. Everybody clear.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.640
FLATLINE

24:08.640 --> 24:12.672
Start compressions. You don't
need to see this, all right?Please.

24:12.672 --> 24:15.172
Everybody's got a job to do without
you getting in the way.

24:15.172 --> 24:17.152
Take her to my office.
Stay with her.

24:17.152 --> 24:18.652
It's going to be all right.

24:18.652 --> 24:19.648
Oh, shit.

24:19.648 --> 24:22.080
FLATLINE

24:22.080 --> 24:23.332
All right, I've got this.

24:23.332 --> 24:28.736
SHE PANTS

24:28.736 --> 24:52.288
Come on, Fingers.

24:52.288 --> 24:55.616
How can it take this long?

24:55.616 --> 25:26.692
Get the adrenaline, please.

25:26.692 --> 25:33.952
FLAT TONE

25:33.952 --> 25:39.292
HE SIGHS

25:39.292 --> 25:48.224
FLAT TONE CONTINUES

25:48.224 --> 25:57.568
TONE STOPS

25:57.568 --> 27:01.184
Time of death, 8.49.

27:01.184 --> 27:41.504
INDISTINCT CHATTER

27:41.504 --> 27:47.332
I need to call Marie.

27:47.332 --> 27:51.296
HE SIGHS

27:51.296 --> 27:55.328
Fingers was the first person to
welcome me into the platoon.

27:55.328 --> 28:00.412
His enthusiasm never waned.

28:00.412 --> 28:05.760
We've all lost a terrific soldier...

28:05.760 --> 28:09.412
..and a friend.

28:09.412 --> 28:12.224
The platoon will stay here,
complete the tour...

28:12.224 --> 28:15.488
..and we do it in his honour.

28:15.488 --> 28:17.984
If any of you guys need to talk,

28:17.984 --> 28:49.280
my office door will be open 24/7.

28:49.280 --> 28:55.372
LINE RINGS

28:55.372 --> 28:57.088
I just want to go out there now

28:57.088 --> 29:04.576
and kill every last
one of them fuckers.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.732
I keep seeing his face.

29:07.732 --> 29:14.752
I see it every time I shut my eyes.

29:14.752 --> 29:16.544
There's nothing that can
make this better.

29:16.544 --> 29:25.824
This is...just it.

29:25.824 --> 29:31.972
SHE SIGHS

29:31.972 --> 29:33.504
MIMI:You OK, Georgie?

29:33.504 --> 30:02.496
I just...need to sort everything.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.372
Georgie, we can do that later.

30:04.372 --> 30:33.052
PROF:Yeah, we can help, Georgie.
I CAN do this.

30:33.052 --> 30:35.456
Hi, Pa. It's me.

30:35.456 --> 30:39.052
Yeah. I just thought
I'd touch base, say hello.

30:39.052 --> 30:44.096
Oh, OK. Yeah, no...

30:44.096 --> 30:46.144
Of course.

30:46.144 --> 30:49.252
Yeah. OK. Erm...

30:49.252 --> 30:51.652
I'm sorry. Just...

30:51.652 --> 30:57.216
..say hi to everyone for me, then.
OK, bye.

30:57.216 --> 30:59.392
KNOCK ON DOOR

30:59.392 --> 31:02.016
Come in.

31:02.016 --> 31:05.092
All set, boss.Wondered if it
might be one of the guys.

31:05.092 --> 31:08.452
No. Me.

31:08.452 --> 31:09.568
Any...

31:09.568 --> 31:14.112
..sage advice before you go?Boss?

31:14.112 --> 31:18.656
I never expected to lose
a man on Op Toral, for fuck sake.

31:18.656 --> 31:22.560
It's a training and security tour.

31:22.560 --> 31:27.296
Yeah, well, we have, sir.
And we carry on because...

31:27.296 --> 31:33.292
..there's no option.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.172
Look. You've given them
an opportunity to talk

31:36.172 --> 31:40.096
but keep them busy.

31:40.096 --> 31:59.452
They're counting on you
to take charge.

31:59.452 --> 32:19.392
BUGLE PLAYS LAST POST

32:19.392 --> 32:28.012
Up.

32:28.012 --> 33:32.480
LAST POST CONTINUES

33:32.480 --> 33:34.656
I could come in with you.

33:34.656 --> 33:37.252
It's something that I'm better
doing by myself, Kingy.

33:37.252 --> 33:40.992
Have you?Yeah.

33:40.992 --> 33:44.332
And, erm...thank you...for...

33:44.332 --> 33:47.968
Everything?

33:47.968 --> 33:50.848
Well, I was going to say driving me
home but, yeah.

33:50.848 --> 34:03.652
For everything.

34:03.652 --> 34:06.412
Hiya, Mum.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.492
Thank you.

34:07.492 --> 34:20.160
You all right, Grace?

34:20.160 --> 34:40.492
Come on.
Let's get you inside, yeah?

34:40.492 --> 34:44.452
Yo, is that Omar?

34:44.452 --> 34:46.912
Put me on guard duty.

34:46.912 --> 34:50.624
One night in his cell...

34:50.624 --> 34:52.416
What time is the funeral?

34:52.416 --> 34:54.016
3pm.

34:54.016 --> 34:55.616
Stand up.

34:55.616 --> 34:57.088
Stand easy, guys.

34:57.088 --> 35:00.928
Right. All eyes on me, please.

35:00.928 --> 35:02.848
We're very aware of what today is,

35:02.848 --> 35:05.728
but it's business as usual.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.852
We go on.

35:07.852 --> 35:11.296
We have no choice.

35:11.296 --> 35:15.200
So we do Fingers proud.

35:15.200 --> 35:23.584
OK, let's go.ALL:Sir.

35:23.584 --> 35:26.784
Hiya, Prof. I, er...I knew your
phone was going to be off.

35:26.784 --> 35:28.576
I just wanted to, er...

35:28.576 --> 35:39.328
..borrow some of your wisdom.

35:39.328 --> 35:41.572
She looks done in.

35:41.572 --> 35:43.972
I don't know what to do.
What can I say to her?

35:43.972 --> 35:46.304
You don't need to say anything to
her, Mum.

35:46.304 --> 35:49.612
She knows you're here for her.

35:49.612 --> 35:52.612
We're both there for her.

35:52.612 --> 35:55.136
Georgie, don't go back.

35:55.136 --> 35:57.412
I couldn't bear it if
I lost you too.

35:57.412 --> 35:59.452
Mum...

35:59.452 --> 36:02.212
..you're not going to lose me.

36:02.212 --> 36:06.532
But I am going back.

36:06.532 --> 36:16.704
WHISPERS: Mum...I'm sorry.

36:16.704 --> 36:20.096
There you go.
Thank you.

36:20.096 --> 36:33.536
GEORGIE CLEARS HER THROAT

36:33.536 --> 36:35.332
Wait.

36:35.332 --> 36:37.132
Are you sure on now?

36:37.132 --> 36:41.932
I need to hear it again.

36:41.932 --> 36:48.576
OK.

36:48.576 --> 36:50.692
PHONE BEEPS

36:50.692 --> 36:52.252
FINGERS' VOICE:Marie.

36:52.252 --> 36:56.332
How you doing?

36:56.332 --> 36:58.048
I've, er...

36:58.048 --> 37:01.824
..got myself into a
spot of bother, babe.

37:01.824 --> 37:04.768
We might have to have our honeymoon
at the QE in Birmingham.

37:04.768 --> 37:07.136
LABOURED BREATHING

37:07.136 --> 37:11.488
I've got so much I need to tell you.

37:11.488 --> 37:18.656
Tell you how you...put my life in
focus.

37:18.656 --> 37:20.332
I didn't even know my life was
out of focus

37:20.332 --> 37:25.056
until you came along, Marie...and
sharpened me.

37:25.056 --> 37:28.704
GROANS:Oh, Marie.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.772
I'm coming home.

37:30.772 --> 37:33.504
I love you.

37:33.504 --> 37:42.464
I'm sorry.

37:42.464 --> 37:44.812
What happened after that, Georgie?

37:44.812 --> 37:49.732
I need every detail.

37:49.732 --> 37:57.824
INAUDIBLE

37:57.824 --> 38:01.344
He loved you.

38:01.344 --> 38:04.864
We've both been loved.

38:04.864 --> 38:08.212
Everything's just a fluke.

38:08.212 --> 38:12.292
You bringing Fingers
home that day.

38:12.292 --> 38:15.488
Me actually being home.

38:15.488 --> 38:19.200
Him slipping me his number
when you were in the kitchen.

38:19.200 --> 38:23.296
It's all a fucking fluke.

38:23.296 --> 38:25.344
Obviously, I knew he was a soldier.

38:25.344 --> 38:27.456
I just...

38:27.456 --> 38:30.144
I didn't think it was going
to end like this.

38:30.144 --> 38:33.600
I know.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.932
Please, just...make
everything OK, Georgie,

38:35.932 --> 38:38.784
like you used to do
when we were kids.

38:38.784 --> 38:43.972
Come here. Come here.

38:43.972 --> 38:45.772
Everything's going to be OK.

38:45.772 --> 38:47.296
SHE SOBS

38:47.296 --> 38:58.752
I promise.

38:58.752 --> 39:01.504
Move your thumb.
What's wrong with you.

39:01.504 --> 39:03.680
Don't look at me -
concentrate on your weapon!

39:03.680 --> 39:04.896
You fire with your thumb there

39:04.896 --> 39:07.612
and it'll be ripped off
when the top slide springs back.

39:07.612 --> 39:10.528
Well, he should fucking know this.

39:10.528 --> 39:11.572
GUNSHOT

39:11.572 --> 39:23.584
BELL TOLLS

39:23.584 --> 39:29.280
Fingers and I, we, erm,
we served together...

39:29.280 --> 39:35.168
..experiencing things that we
could never share with anyone else.

39:35.168 --> 39:38.304
And then he met my sister...

39:38.304 --> 39:40.252
..and he fell in love

39:40.252 --> 39:47.904
and he wanted to spend
the rest of his life with her.

39:47.904 --> 39:51.172
A comrade of ours found a book

39:51.172 --> 39:53.856
underneath Fingers' bed.

39:53.856 --> 39:56.932
It was a present from Marie.

39:56.932 --> 40:00.772
It's called The Fault in Our Stars.

40:00.772 --> 40:03.200
SHE FALTERS

40:03.200 --> 40:07.616
SHE SNIFFS, CLEARS HER THROAT

40:07.616 --> 40:11.264
"The pleasure of remembering
had been taken from me,

40:11.264 --> 40:15.360
"because there was no longer
anyone to remember with.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.216
GUNSHOT RINGS OUT

40:17.216 --> 40:20.608
"It felt like losing your
co-rememberer,

40:20.608 --> 40:24.064
"meant losing the memory itself,

40:24.064 --> 40:28.288
"as if the things we'd done
were less real and important

40:28.288 --> 41:31.372
"than they had been hours before."

41:31.372 --> 41:41.056
INAUDIBLE

41:41.056 --> 41:43.936
Detail, unload.

41:43.936 --> 41:46.176
What the hell are you doing?!

41:46.176 --> 41:48.172
Never point a loaded weapon
at anyone.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.572
Are you stupid or what?Monk.
We're trying to help you here.

41:50.572 --> 41:52.732
Maybe you need to learn
a bit of respect.Shut up.

41:52.732 --> 41:55.136
You're a guest in this country...
Are you taking the piss?

41:55.136 --> 41:57.532
Monk, Throbber, move away
right now.Let's go.

41:57.532 --> 41:59.616
Move. Move.I'll see you in my
office shortly.

41:59.616 --> 42:01.408
I'll knock that
geezer into next week!

42:01.408 --> 42:04.612
Yeah, and if you do that, what's
going to happen? You're going to
get kicked out.

42:04.612 --> 42:08.128
I saw him when we was repatriating
Fingers.Mate, they don't care.

42:08.128 --> 42:11.584
I don't know what you saw, but
Fingers was nothing to them, man.

42:11.584 --> 42:13.440
I know how you feel.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.296
I miss him too.

42:15.296 --> 42:16.852
You'll never know how I feel,

42:16.852 --> 42:18.892
so don't give it the big 'un
about knowing Fingers,

42:18.892 --> 42:20.864
cos you weren't his mate, or mine.

42:20.864 --> 42:24.652
Move.

42:24.652 --> 42:26.624
I know what you must be going
through,

42:26.624 --> 42:28.928
but you've got to
keep yourself in check.

42:28.928 --> 42:31.104
You feel something bubbling up,
you count to ten.

42:31.104 --> 42:32.832
He looked at his watch, sir.

42:32.832 --> 42:35.456
What?
When we were repatriating Fingers.

42:35.456 --> 42:36.864
It's not on.

42:36.864 --> 42:39.104
He was being disrespectful, sir.

42:39.104 --> 42:43.392
It must be unimaginable, Monk...

42:43.392 --> 42:48.000
..to lose your friend
and stay on the tour.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.304
VOICE BREAKS:I was his best man

42:50.304 --> 42:54.656
and saw them pack his life
into a little box.

42:54.656 --> 43:00.172
I don't want my son handed a box
with all of me in it.

43:00.172 --> 43:02.692
It makes me think, sir,

43:02.692 --> 43:06.560
what would happen to him
if anything happened to me?

43:06.560 --> 43:08.864
I was a child of the regiment,

43:08.864 --> 43:10.464
like your little boy.

43:10.464 --> 43:12.256
You were like my Thumper?

43:12.256 --> 43:14.692
In the sense that...

43:14.692 --> 43:18.336
..my dad was always on tour too.

43:18.336 --> 43:22.816
But you know what?

43:22.816 --> 43:26.272
If you make
your time at home with him special,

43:26.272 --> 43:30.944
and you let him know how much you
love him...

43:30.944 --> 43:35.616
..all will be well.

43:35.616 --> 43:40.252
Is that what your father
did with you?

43:40.252 --> 43:56.572
My door's always open, Monk.

43:56.572 --> 43:59.744
Hi.Hey.

43:59.744 --> 44:03.136
I used to come here every day
after school.

44:03.136 --> 44:06.080
Meet my mates.

44:06.080 --> 44:09.344
Had my first bit of alcohol here.

44:09.344 --> 44:12.052
My first snog.

44:12.052 --> 44:14.592
Brendan bloody Lewis,

44:14.592 --> 44:18.816
on this roundabout.

44:18.816 --> 44:23.104
He told me about his mum's suicide.

44:23.104 --> 44:25.372
So, out of sympathy,

44:25.372 --> 44:28.288
I let him give me a love bite.

44:28.288 --> 44:30.336
Anyway, next day,

44:30.336 --> 44:32.384
went round to his, knocked on.

44:32.384 --> 44:37.376
His mum answered the door.

44:37.376 --> 44:44.032
Should have had it sussed out then,
eh?

44:44.032 --> 44:46.080
It's bullshit.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.936
What?

44:47.936 --> 44:50.368
Everything, Kingy.

44:50.368 --> 44:54.208
Everything?Mm.

44:54.208 --> 44:58.688
Or are we just cursed?

44:58.688 --> 45:03.532
HE SIGHS

45:03.532 --> 45:06.532
Two sisters.

45:06.532 --> 45:10.852
Two sisters both
losing their partners in Afghan.

45:10.852 --> 45:13.920
GEORGIE SIGHS

45:13.920 --> 45:15.532
Marie asked me this morning

45:15.532 --> 45:18.016
if everything was going to be
all right.

45:18.016 --> 45:21.856
There was nothing I could say.

45:21.856 --> 45:24.292
No words will ever make it easier.

45:24.292 --> 45:26.932
It's just this...

45:26.932 --> 45:31.012
..fucking hollow
pain that never goes away.

45:31.012 --> 45:38.624
Ever.

45:38.624 --> 45:43.552
I think about him, Kingy.

45:43.552 --> 45:49.632
All the time.

45:49.632 --> 45:54.816
I put my head on the pillow
and there he is. There's Elvis.

45:54.816 --> 46:02.692
I think about him so fucking much.

46:02.692 --> 46:06.464
You know, sometimes I wonder

46:06.464 --> 46:08.812
whether he's actually alive,

46:08.812 --> 46:14.528
and all this is just a sign.

46:14.528 --> 46:18.176
I know it's crazy.Mm.

46:18.176 --> 46:20.352
Kingy, I didn't even
check his fucking pulse.

46:20.352 --> 46:22.372
Oh, come on, Georgie,
you didn't have to.

46:22.372 --> 46:28.972
Oh, come on. All right, say he
wasn't dead when they took him.

46:28.972 --> 46:31.616
You're looking at me like I'm mad.

46:31.616 --> 46:45.824
You are...mad.

46:45.824 --> 46:50.176
Look. Why don't you
stay here for a bit?

46:50.176 --> 46:52.612
Get that head right?No.
I'm going back to Afghan with you.

46:52.612 --> 46:54.208
We can finish off the tour
without you.

46:54.208 --> 46:56.812
Kingy, don't you dare
kick me off now.Easy.

46:56.812 --> 46:59.136
No-one's kicking you off.
Your call.

46:59.136 --> 47:01.376
But I've a right to be concerned

47:01.376 --> 47:05.932
and you could do me the respect of
listening. That's all.

47:05.932 --> 47:08.692
OK.

47:08.692 --> 47:12.172
Thank you. I'm fine.

47:12.172 --> 47:14.816
I'm coming back with you.

47:14.816 --> 47:19.168
I've got unfinished business.

47:19.168 --> 47:20.384
BABY CRIES

47:20.384 --> 47:24.928
# Go to sleep
Go to sleep

47:24.928 --> 47:29.216
# Little baby go to sleep. #

47:29.216 --> 47:32.480
Well, it ain't going to happen with
you warbling down the line at him.

47:32.480 --> 47:34.208
I'm soothing him, Doris.

47:34.208 --> 47:37.132
Yeah, righto.

47:37.132 --> 47:40.544
Tell him I love him.He knows that.

47:40.544 --> 47:51.172
And I love you too.
And I love you back.

47:51.172 --> 47:52.704
Do you know what?

47:52.704 --> 47:55.776
There are parts of my life that
I choose not to tell everyone.

47:55.776 --> 47:57.412
Right?

47:57.412 --> 48:00.704
OK. I don't know what you're
chatting about, by the way.

48:00.704 --> 48:02.692
I'm just being friendly.

48:02.692 --> 48:04.288
OK.

48:04.288 --> 48:06.336
I don't care who your parents are.

48:06.336 --> 48:08.812
Whether they're teachers or
chess champions or doctors.

48:08.812 --> 48:10.972
It doesn't matter,
it's not relevant.

48:10.972 --> 48:13.632
I just don't want to talk about it
because it's not important.

48:13.632 --> 48:15.488
You don't have to lie to impress us.

48:15.488 --> 48:18.892
Right? We like you for being you.

48:18.892 --> 48:26.092
We're here to escort you to
the American base, sir.Fine.

48:26.092 --> 48:28.132
What are your thoughts?
They all want a deal.

48:28.132 --> 48:30.532
And we want his intel on Taliban
activity,

48:30.532 --> 48:32.512
here and across the border.

48:32.512 --> 48:35.008
He has known links with ISIS.

48:35.008 --> 48:38.692
His evidence would potentially
damage the insurgency in the region.

48:38.692 --> 48:40.512
He's willing to collaborate.

48:40.512 --> 48:43.328
They'll say whatever they think
we want to hear.Look.

48:43.328 --> 48:45.652
He'd only get a deal if he gave us
something concrete.

48:45.652 --> 48:47.232
What have we got to lose?

48:47.232 --> 49:11.812
The sooner we pull out lock, stock
and barrel, the better it will be.

49:11.812 --> 49:13.612
How was it?

49:13.612 --> 49:17.248
Yeah, we did him proud.

49:17.248 --> 49:20.256
What, don't I get a hug,
or am I a bit ripe post-flight?

49:20.256 --> 49:23.968
I didn't want to say anything.

49:23.968 --> 49:28.448
You all right, Colour?Hello.
You all right?Good to see you.

49:28.448 --> 49:31.904
How's your clicky knee?
Ah, er...Clicky as ever.

49:31.904 --> 49:34.208
You know what? It could be your
boot.

49:34.208 --> 49:36.172
I'll give it a check when I get in.

49:36.172 --> 49:39.172
How did you get on with
Fault in Our Stars?

49:39.172 --> 49:43.872
Yeah, I got to the end.
Just about.Good.

49:43.872 --> 49:46.132
Thank you for keeping in touch.

49:46.132 --> 49:53.408
Always.

49:53.408 --> 49:56.692
Come on, Cheese.

49:56.692 --> 50:07.296
LOUD MUSIC SPILLS FROM HEADPHONES

50:07.296 --> 50:10.688
Cheese, this is 2 Section.

50:10.688 --> 50:12.096
How do?

50:12.096 --> 50:15.552
Guys, we've got a new member for the
duration of the rest of this tour.

50:15.552 --> 50:17.856
Prof, can I charge you
with settling him in?

50:17.856 --> 50:20.224
Oh, yeah. You know me, Colour.
Mother hen.

50:20.224 --> 50:23.616
Come on, Cheese.All right, mate?
Come on, Cheesy, lad.

50:23.616 --> 50:25.132
I'm Throbber, yeah?

50:25.132 --> 50:28.160
All right, soldier?
All right, Georgie?

50:28.160 --> 50:38.848
All right, Mimi?

50:38.848 --> 50:41.572
The wanderer returns.

50:41.572 --> 50:43.072
How you doing?

50:43.072 --> 50:44.608
How's Dr Bahil?

50:44.608 --> 50:47.572
Driving me crazy, wanting
to be discharged.

50:47.572 --> 50:49.344
How are you?

50:49.344 --> 50:52.544
Fit and ready for anything the Army
has to throw at me.

50:52.544 --> 50:54.976
I want to make sure you're ready to
dive straight back in.

50:54.976 --> 50:56.812
100%.

50:56.812 --> 50:58.624
You're a good soldier.

50:58.624 --> 51:00.772
It's been a difficult few days.

51:00.772 --> 51:02.720
It hasn't been easy.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.640
What's that saying?

51:04.640 --> 51:08.736
God places the heaviest
burden on those who can carry it.

51:08.736 --> 51:12.256
Well...

51:12.256 --> 51:16.492
..sometimes I can feel
me knees buckling.

51:16.492 --> 51:21.172
I hope you always know that
I'm here...

51:21.172 --> 51:23.968
..if you need me.

51:23.968 --> 51:28.064
I know.

51:28.064 --> 51:32.452
Thank you.

51:32.452 --> 51:35.212
So you was, like, on the bench,

51:35.212 --> 51:36.896
and the manager goes,

51:36.896 --> 51:39.840
"Get yourself warmed up, fella -
you're on"?

51:39.840 --> 51:42.080
Sort of. I was at Woolwich.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.744
They put out a trawl.

51:43.744 --> 51:45.536
Ta, mate.S'all right.

51:45.536 --> 51:47.584
It's been a right
clusterfuck, this tour.

51:47.584 --> 51:49.612
I was briefed.

51:49.612 --> 51:55.072
I'm sorry to hear
about all the shit.

51:55.072 --> 51:56.736
Look at you, fella.

51:56.736 --> 51:59.572
You look like a Victorian boxer.

51:59.572 --> 52:02.692
Wish I had my protein shake
this morning now.

52:02.692 --> 52:05.248
I used to be able to bench nearly
twice me body weight.

52:05.248 --> 52:06.656
I can believe it.

52:06.656 --> 52:13.184
Some guns you're packing there.

52:13.184 --> 52:14.976
Yo.

52:14.976 --> 52:18.176
I'm sorry about the other day.

52:18.176 --> 52:20.480
A few more hours in Op Massive

52:20.480 --> 52:32.832
and I reckon I'd be able to bench
the whole bloody platoon.

52:32.832 --> 52:35.456
Come in.
You ready for me and my clicky knee?

52:35.456 --> 52:37.056
Get in.

52:37.056 --> 52:41.932
Oh, you want me on your couch?
Go on, hop on.

52:41.932 --> 52:43.456
HE GROANS

52:43.456 --> 52:45.772
It's all right?
Yeah.

52:45.772 --> 52:49.408
Put this underneath.Thank you.

52:49.408 --> 52:51.328
Any discomfort?

52:51.328 --> 52:53.824
Ooh! Other than them cold hands?

52:53.824 --> 52:57.792
I'll wear my Marigolds next time.

52:57.792 --> 53:01.504
How's it been here?

53:01.504 --> 53:03.296
It's hit everyone.

53:03.296 --> 53:06.624
Mm. The enemy's been captured.

53:06.624 --> 53:08.224
I mean, it's not the end

53:08.224 --> 53:10.464
but at least, you know,
I feel like it's...

53:10.464 --> 53:18.720
What, some sort of closure?
Yeah, maybe.

53:18.720 --> 53:23.712
What?

53:23.712 --> 53:27.616
I think I may have inadvertently
overhead some intel...

53:27.616 --> 53:29.344
..about Omar.

53:29.344 --> 53:30.816
What?

53:30.816 --> 53:32.736
Don't shoot the messenger,

53:32.736 --> 53:37.856
but I think they may be planning
on cutting him some type of deal.

53:37.856 --> 53:41.056
What do you mean? What sort of deal?

53:41.056 --> 53:44.384
He's going to give them information
on various other warlords,

53:44.384 --> 53:46.372
and in return...
They let him off?

53:46.372 --> 53:49.612
I'm not sure. I don't know.
I mean, probably not.

53:49.612 --> 53:52.192
But there has been instances where
warlords have been given

53:52.192 --> 53:55.012
a new identity and started
life in a new country.No.

53:55.012 --> 53:59.812
Georgie.No.No, Georgie.

53:59.812 --> 54:02.692
Medic. I need to hydrate!

54:02.692 --> 54:06.144
Here you are.

54:06.144 --> 54:08.812
I'll just grab another bottle.

54:08.812 --> 54:10.132
HE WHISTLES

54:10.132 --> 54:12.416
I'm not being rude
but I'm a bit busy.

54:12.416 --> 54:16.256
Look at you,
all respectable in your uniform.

54:16.256 --> 54:18.496
Butter wouldn't melt.

54:18.496 --> 54:27.456
What would people make of this
new you back home?

54:27.456 --> 54:29.184
Sergeant?

54:29.184 --> 54:30.784
Is it true? They're thinking about

54:30.784 --> 54:32.704
doing a deal with Omar
and letting him off?

54:32.704 --> 54:34.372
That's enough, Sergeant Lane.

54:34.372 --> 54:38.976
Countless killings,
torturing, beheading,

54:38.976 --> 54:41.600
blowing people off
tops of buildings,

54:41.600 --> 54:43.392
but you grass on a couple of your
mates

54:43.392 --> 54:45.892
and it's a slap on the wrist,
innit?You finished?

54:45.892 --> 54:48.576
Right. Get outside, shut the door.

54:48.576 --> 54:50.816
Knock on the door and wait until

54:50.816 --> 54:54.464
I say enter before opening.
Understood?

54:54.464 --> 54:55.744
KNOCK ON DOOR

54:55.744 --> 55:07.648
Enter.

55:07.648 --> 55:09.376
They just looked at me.

55:09.376 --> 55:11.488
It was so obvious.What?

55:11.488 --> 55:13.984
That they're complicit in this
arrangement.

55:13.984 --> 55:15.584
I mean the Brigadier certainly is.

55:15.584 --> 55:18.336
Otherwise, he would have said it
wasn't true.

55:18.336 --> 55:21.088
I wasn't saying anything to him
that he didn't already know.

55:21.088 --> 55:23.392
He knows they're cutting
a deal with Attan Omar.

55:23.392 --> 55:24.800
I could see it in his eyes.

55:24.800 --> 55:28.320
Yeah. It's awful,
this bigger-picture crap.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.652
Come in.

55:30.652 --> 55:33.440
You knocked, Lane?

55:33.440 --> 55:53.600
On me.

55:53.600 --> 55:56.992
Sir, firstly, please accept my
apologies for my previous outburst.

55:56.992 --> 55:58.464
It won't happen again, sir.

55:58.464 --> 56:01.152
At ease, Sergeant.

56:01.152 --> 56:03.652
We have a duty of care.

56:03.652 --> 56:06.976
We are constantly evaluating what is
      best for the regiment

56:06.976 --> 56:09.600
and for the individual soldier.

56:09.600 --> 56:11.332
Sir?

56:11.332 --> 56:14.092
With regard to the current situation
    that we're dealing with,

56:14.092 --> 56:18.944
you have a personal involvement that
isn't beneficial to your wellbeing.

56:18.944 --> 56:21.568
We've all got personal involvement,
haven't we, sir?

56:21.568 --> 56:23.232
Sergeant Lane.

56:23.232 --> 56:25.920
Omar's killed one of our platoon.

56:25.920 --> 56:29.332
He also happened to
be behind the murder of your fiance.

56:29.332 --> 56:33.664
Judging by your erstwhile behaviour,
  there is a cause for concern.

56:33.664 --> 56:35.008
Can you perform your duties

56:35.008 --> 56:37.376
in a dispassionate
and professional manner?

56:37.376 --> 56:39.616
That's bullshit, sir.
Sergeant Lane.

56:39.616 --> 56:41.692
You are rather proving his point.

56:41.692 --> 56:43.328
This is not a matter for debate.

56:43.328 --> 56:44.932
And...
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

56:44.932 --> 56:47.296
..we need you to see
the psych for evaluation.

56:47.296 --> 56:50.048
UNDER HER BREATH: Oh, my God.

56:50.048 --> 56:53.504
You will be confined to barracks
and placed on restricted duties

56:53.504 --> 56:55.132
until further notice,

56:55.132 --> 56:57.536
and until it can be determined
whether you are fit enough

56:57.536 --> 56:59.904
to continue this tour...

56:59.904 --> 57:03.424
..or indeed continue in the Army.

57:03.424 --> 57:05.812
Thank you, Sergeant Lane.
Can I just say...?No.

57:05.812 --> 57:15.052
Thank you, Sergeant Lane.

57:15.052 --> 57:30.052
BOOT CLICKS

57:30.052 --> 57:32.608
Tensions are running high,
we've just lost one of our men.

57:32.608 --> 57:34.144
Watch where you're going, prick.

57:34.144 --> 57:35.488
Crack us a smile son.

57:35.488 --> 57:37.732
I'm so sick and tired
of you British people.

57:37.732 --> 57:40.612
Omar is trying to cut some deal
with the Americans.

57:40.612 --> 57:42.784
I think it's best you leave.

57:42.784 --> 57:45.664
Your psych assessment has been
arranged for this morning.

57:45.664 --> 57:47.584
They think I've
got PTSD, don't they?

57:47.584 --> 57:49.972
Let's not rule anything
out at this stage.

57:49.972 --> 57:51.360
Heads up! Heads up!

57:51.360 --> 57:53.600
All rooms are clear,
bomb-making factory found.

57:53.600 --> 57:55.456
HE ISSUES COMMAND OVER CLAMOUR

57:55.456 --> 57:58.656
What the hell went down with
you and that old man?

57:58.656 --> 58:00.772
You keep my secret,
and I'll keep yours.
