THEY'RE GONNA BE MAD AT ME
JUST LIKE YOU ARE.
I AM MAD.

THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL DO A GREAT JOB.

UNCONSCIOUS!

BETTER AT OTHERS?

IN THE MORNINGS,

LIKE, RIGHT AFTER BREAKFAST.

09:29.039 --> 09:32.002
IS, UH, WHEN HE
HAS TO GO TO SCHOOL.

09:32.002 --> 09:35.245
BUT I FEEL IT
AT OTHER TIMES, TOO.
RIGHT, LIKE, UH,
WHEN YOU HAVE A SPANISH TEST

09:35.245 --> 09:38.578
OR, UH, HAVE TO GIVE
A PRESENTATION IN HISTORY CLASS.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.852

ABDOMINAL PAIN.
PLEASE, DOCTOR,
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.

HE'S JUST FAKING
SO HE COULD MISS SCHOOL.
I AM NOT.

09:44.114 --> 09:46.116

NOT RIGID.

09:46.116 --> 09:48.118
BOWEL SOUNDS ARE GOOD.

STILL, I'D LIKE TO COVER
ALL THE BASES.

09:50.621 --> 09:53.724

HOW WOULD YOU PROCEED?
WE COULD TRY
A TRIPLE-CONTRAST C.T.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.095
MM-HMM. DO IT.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.097
BRAD, THIS IS GONNA COST US
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

09:57.097 --> 09:59.369
AND INSURANCE
ONLY COVERS PART OF IT.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.732
YOU--YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
I'M NOT FAKING IT.

10:01.732 --> 10:04.174
I--I'M NOT FAKING IT, DAD.
I SWEAR.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.742
(indistinct conversations)

10:11.742 --> 10:14.745
DR. ALTMAN, UH, I NOTICED
YOU HAVE AVERY ASSIGNED

10:14.745 --> 10:17.047
TO ALL YOUR SURGERIES
THIS MORNING.
I DO.

10:17.047 --> 10:21.051
UM, SO THERE'S NO ROOM...
FOR ME ON YOUR SERVICE?

10:21.051 --> 10:23.794
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN ON EVERY ONE
OF MY CASES SINCE I'VE ARRIVED.

10:23.794 --> 10:25.856
THIS IS A TEACHING HOSPITAL.

10:25.856 --> 10:28.799
IT'S ONLY FAIR I GIVE
OTHER RESIDENTS A CHANCE.

10:28.799 --> 10:31.962
YES. YES, OF COURSE. I-I--
I UNDERSTAND.

10:31.962 --> 10:34.965
UM... DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE
ROOM ON YOUR SERVICE TOMORROW

10:34.965 --> 10:36.767
OR THE NEXT DAY?

10:36.767 --> 10:38.769
I, UH, I... (sighs)
I-I DON'T KNOW.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.671
I JUST...

10:42.843 --> 10:44.845
I CAN'T TODAY, CRISTINA.
OKAY?

10:44.845 --> 10:48.118
I JUST... I CAN'T.

10:50.981 --> 10:52.282
UM, LESLIE, HI.

10:52.282 --> 10:55.655
UH, THIS WILL
ONLY TAKE A MOMENT.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.288
WE JUST NEED TO EXAMINE
YOUR INCIS--
HEY, CAREFUL.

10:58.288 --> 11:01.331
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TOUCH ME.

11:01.331 --> 11:03.233
LESLIE...
I MEAN IT.

11:03.233 --> 11:05.335
DON'T LET HER TOUCH ME.

11:05.335 --> 11:08.699
OKAY, UH, I-I KNOW THAT YOU'VE
BEEN THROUGH A LOT TODAY,

11:08.699 --> 11:11.742
BUT IF WE DON'T CHECK YOUR IN--
I REMEMBER.

11:11.742 --> 11:16.406
I REMEMBER
YOU SCREAMING IN SURGERY.

11:16.406 --> 11:20.150
YOU WERE PANICKING...
SHE'S GETTING TACHYCARDIC.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.953
PANICKING WITH YOUR HAND
INSIDE MY BODY.
(monitor beeping erratically)

11:22.953 --> 11:24.855
YOU WERE JUST...

11:24.855 --> 11:27.788
(panting)
DR. BAILEY, HER INCISION SITE
IS BLEEDING.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.290
SHE COULD'VE RIPPED IT OPEN.
I MEAN IT. DON'T TOUCH ME!

11:30.290 --> 11:33.193
OKAY.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO TOUCH ME.
DON'T T--NO!

11:33.193 --> 11:36.096
GREY, REDRESS THE WOUND, OKAY?
DON'T TOUCH ME!

11:36.096 --> 11:38.729
UH, USE THE DRESSING TO APPLY
PRESSURE WITH ONE HAND

11:38.729 --> 11:41.131
AND GRAB AS MUCH GAUZE
AS YOU CAN WITH THE OTHER.
OKAY.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.303
SEE THAT TAPE THERE?
YOU'RE GONNA NEED YOU

11:43.303 --> 11:45.135
A NICE, LONG PIECE.
UH-HUH.

11:45.135 --> 11:47.137
(beeping continues)

11:48.979 --> 11:50.340
HEY. NEED SOME HELP?

11:50.340 --> 11:52.182
UH, NO. I'M GOOD. THANKS.

11:52.182 --> 11:53.343
(sighs)

11:53.343 --> 11:55.145
OKAY. NEVER MIND.

11:55.145 --> 11:57.347
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MARK.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.049
COULD YOU NOT RIP THOSE?

11:59.049 --> 12:01.091
HE ISN'T SPEAKING TO ME.
HE BARELY EVEN LOOKS AT ME.

12:01.091 --> 12:04.054
AND I KNOW THAT WE BROKE UP,
BUT WE STILL WORK TOGETHER,

12:04.054 --> 12:07.057
AND I'M GONNA BE
A PLASTIC SURGEON.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
A PLASTIC SURGEON.

12:07.057 --> 12:09.729
STILL, OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SEE EACH OTHER EVERY DAY.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.732
I MEAN, HE'S BEST FRIENDS WITH
MY SISTER'S POST-IT HUSBAND.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.766
I... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I KNOW. HE'S NOT EXACTLY
BEING FAIR.

12:15.766 --> 12:18.909
NO, HE'S NOT BEING FAIR.
HEY, SERIOUSLY.
GO EASY ON THE CAST PADDING.

12:18.909 --> 12:20.911
YOU KNOW, AT LEAST
HE COULD BE CIVIL.

12:20.911 --> 12:23.974
I HAD A ONE-NIGHT STAND.
OKAY, BIG DEAL.
RIGHT.

12:23.974 --> 12:26.416
IT'S NOT LIKE HE DIDN'T
SLEEP WITH ADDISON.
TRUE, MORE THAN ONCE.

12:26.416 --> 12:29.880
WHAT?
HMM?

12:29.880 --> 12:32.422
NOTHING.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
MORE THAN ONCE?

12:32.422 --> 12:34.985
MORE THAN ONCE?!

12:34.985 --> 12:36.987
OH! (scoffs)

12:38.829 --> 12:41.131
(Alex) WHAT ABOUT THAT?
THAT SPOT--SEE IT?

12:41.131 --> 12:43.233
OH. THAT WAS LINT.

12:43.233 --> 12:46.236
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
I MEAN, NO KID WANTS TO BE

12:46.236 --> 12:48.939
THE LOSER MISSING CLASS
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

12:48.939 --> 12:50.941
I DON'T CARE
HOW LAME YOU ARE.

12:50.941 --> 12:53.173
I LOVED THE HOSPITAL
WHEN I WAS A KID.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.405
NO SCHOOL, LOTS OF COOL
MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO PLAY WITH

12:55.405 --> 12:57.077
AND...

12:57.077 --> 12:59.079
OKAY, YEAH.
SO LET'S GO OVER IT AGAIN.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.781
HE PRESENTED WITH SEVERE
BUT INTERMITTENT ABDOMINAL PAIN,

13:01.781 --> 13:03.083
NO DISCERNABLE PATTERN.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.255
LABS WERE NORMAL.
NO FEVER.

13:05.255 --> 13:07.958
SOFT ABDOMEN ON EXAM.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.961
WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING.

13:10.961 --> 13:13.323
CHRONIC MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA?

13:13.323 --> 13:15.325
AH. I MEAN,
IT'S A STRETCH FOR A KID,

13:15.325 --> 13:17.828
BUT IF HE HAD
VASCULAR PROBLEMS--
NO, IT FITS ALL THE SYMPTOMS,

13:17.828 --> 13:20.130
AND IT DOESN'T SHOW UP
ON THE SCANS.
YEAH, BUT THE PROBLEM IS,

13:20.130 --> 13:22.232
THE ONLY WAY TO GET
AN ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS

13:22.232 --> 13:24.875
IS TO RUN
AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROSCOPY.
SO?

13:24.875 --> 13:27.177
BRAD'S FATHER DIDN'T WANT US
TO RUN A C.T.

13:27.177 --> 13:30.180
YOU REALLY THINK HE'S GONNA
AGREE TO EXPLORATORY SURGERY?

13:30.180 --> 13:31.511
(sighs)

13:36.216 --> 13:39.349
HEY. YOU--YOU KNOW, WHY--
TEDDY'S BLACKBALLING ME.

13:39.349 --> 13:41.521
SHE'S NOT SAYING
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DOING,

13:41.521 --> 13:44.194
BUT I THINK
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DO--

13:44.194 --> 13:45.996
MM.

13:51.501 --> 13:53.503
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT TEDDY.

13:53.503 --> 13:55.505
DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT TEDDY?

13:55.505 --> 13:57.207
NO.

14:05.615 --> 14:08.618
(Reed) I HEARD HE HAD
SOME KIND OF MENTAL BREAKDOWN.

14:08.618 --> 14:10.120
I HEARD IT WAS DRUGS.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.152
NO WAY. PRESCRIPTION OR--

14:12.152 --> 14:15.155
GO PRACTICE MEDICINE, NOW.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.988
RICHARD.
THIS--SITTING HERE--

14:17.988 --> 14:19.529
THIS ISN'T GOOD.
THIS ISN'T HELPING THINGS.

14:19.529 --> 14:22.192
JUST SIGN THE PAPER.
GO TO REHAB.

14:22.192 --> 14:25.635
SIGN THE PAPER.
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE? WHO DO YOU--

14:25.635 --> 14:29.139
LOOK, YOU ARE NOT MY BOSS
AND YOU ARE NOT MY CHIEF.

14:29.139 --> 14:31.201
YOU MAY HAVE STOLEN MY OFFICE
OUT FROM UNDER ME...
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE...

14:31.201 --> 14:33.643
BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT--
AND I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU
LIKE YOU HELPED ME.

14:33.643 --> 14:36.907
I HELPED YOU!
I DIDN'T GET YOU FIRED.
YOU GOT FIRED THE MINUTE
YOU TOOK YOUR FIRST DRINK.

14:36.907 --> 14:39.409
GET OUT OF MY FACE.
NO. NO, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DO THIS.

14:39.409 --> 14:42.182
YOU'RE NOT ENDING YOUR CAREER
TO GET BACK AT ME.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.215
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO
AND NOTHING MORE.
YOU LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND YOU SAY THAT AGAIN.

14:48.358 --> 14:52.122
I WANTED THE JOB.

14:52.122 --> 14:55.295
I WANTED THE JOB.
I ADMIT THAT.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.298
I DIDN'T WANT TO END
YOUR CAREER.
WELL, THAT PART'S
NOT UP TO YOU, IS IT?

14:58.298 --> 15:00.370
YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

15:00.370 --> 15:03.333
BUT THIS PART...
IS UP TO ME.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.305
SO GET OUT.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.437
NO!
STOP IT, BOTH OF YOU.

15:07.437 --> 15:10.180
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING.

15:19.089 --> 15:21.191

15:46.476 --> 15:49.579
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

15:49.579 --> 15:52.652
THE GAS MAN
WOULD LIKE AN APOLOGY.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.324
WHAT?

15:54.324 --> 15:57.157
LESLIE WILSON'S
CYTOCHROME P-450 RESULTS.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.029
THE TYPE SHE HAS MEANS

15:59.029 --> 16:01.491
SHE METABOLIZES
ANESTHETIC DRUGS TOO FAST--

16:01.491 --> 16:03.563
WAY MORE RAPIDLY
THAN YOU OR ME.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.266
THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD'VE
KNOWN THAT BEFORE SURGERY.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.268
SO THIS IS WHY SHE WOKE UP?

16:08.268 --> 16:09.969
IT IS.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.972
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET DOWN
ON YOUR KNEES AND APOLOGIZE,

16:12.972 --> 16:15.105
BUT I WOULD LIKE SOMETHING
HEARTFELT.

16:15.105 --> 16:17.547
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF,

16:17.547 --> 16:19.549
"YOU WERE RIGHT.
I WAS RASH, KIND OF MEAN."

16:19.549 --> 16:22.012
MAYBE EVEN THROW IN
A, "TURNS OUT

16:22.012 --> 16:24.254
YOU'RE A HELL OF A DOCTOR."
(chuckles)

16:24.254 --> 16:27.757
IT WASN'T OUR FAULT.
THAT'S... THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

16:27.757 --> 16:29.759
SHE'S GONNA NEED
A SECOND SURGERY.

16:29.759 --> 16:32.422
THE INCISION SITE
WON'T STOP BLEEDING.

16:32.422 --> 16:35.025
SHE MIGHT HAVE
INTERNAL BLEEDING.

16:35.025 --> 16:37.027
OKAY.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY,

16:37.027 --> 16:39.229
BUT NOW I KNOW
HOW TO KEEP HER UNDER.

16:39.229 --> 16:43.503
SHE WON'T LET ME TOUCH HER.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.405
OH.

16:47.677 --> 16:50.510

NO NEED TO BE EMBARRASSED.

BARRING PHYSICAL VIOLENCE,

20:05.375 --> 20:07.377
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

20:07.377 --> 20:10.340
THIS IS PEDS. YOUR PATIENTS
CAN'T ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.742
SO IN ADDITION TO SURGERY,
A BIG PART OF THE JOB

20:12.742 --> 20:16.346
IS ADVOCATING FOR THEM.
YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT?

20:16.346 --> 20:18.348
YES,
THIS IS EXPLORATORY SURGERY,

20:18.348 --> 20:20.850
AND, YES, BRAD'S SCANS
LOOK CLEAN, BUT IF WE'RE RIGHT,

20:20.850 --> 20:23.293
IF HE HAS MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA
AND YOU TAKE HIM HOME,

20:23.293 --> 20:26.356
THE BLOOD FLOW TO HIS INTESTINE
WILL SLOWLY STOP,

20:26.356 --> 20:28.858
KILLING THE TISSUE,
CAUSING BRAD TO BECOME SEPTIC,

20:28.858 --> 20:30.860
FORCING HIS BODY
INTO SUCH INTENSE SHOCK

20:30.860 --> 20:32.862
THAT BY THE TIME YOU REALIZE
WHAT'S HAPPENING

20:32.862 --> 20:34.404
AND YOU CALL AN AMBULANCE,

20:34.404 --> 20:36.806
THE CHANCE OF BRAD GETTING BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL ALIVE

20:36.806 --> 20:38.308
IS NEXT TO ZERO.

20:38.308 --> 20:40.340
YOU THINK HE'S FAKING.
I GET THAT.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.943
SO THE ONLY REAL QUESTION IS,
HOW SURE ARE YOU? HOW SURE?

20:52.522 --> 20:53.883
I UNDERSTAND YOUR HESITATION,

20:53.883 --> 20:56.556
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU NEED A SECOND SURGERY.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.859
HAVEN'T YOU PUT HER THROUGH
ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY?
I CAN MAKE SOME CALLS, SEE IF
WE CAN GET YOU TRANSFERRED

20:59.859 --> 21:01.691
TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL.

21:01.691 --> 21:04.263
A TRANSFER TAKES TIME,
AND THE LONGER WE WAIT,

21:04.263 --> 21:08.338
SHE'S AT GREATER RISK
FOR INFECTION OR BLOOD LOSS.
LESLIE, I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,

21:08.338 --> 21:11.000
BUT THE DRESSING I DID EARLIER
IS ONLY TEMPORARY.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.343
IT NEEDS
TO BE FIXED PROPERLY.

21:13.343 --> 21:16.776
IT WAS LIKE BEING IN A COFFIN--
ALIVE... IN A COFFIN.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.049
I COULDN'T TALK,
COULDN'T MOVE.

21:20.049 --> 21:23.853
THE THOUGHT OF YOUR HAND
BACK INSIDE ME...

21:23.853 --> 21:26.356
LESLIE, SWEETIE, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING

21:26.356 --> 21:28.718
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.693
YOU CAN DO IT.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.024
WHAT?

21:35.024 --> 21:37.026
YOU WERE THERE.

21:37.026 --> 21:40.900
YOU STAYED CALM.
YOU WERE KIND.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.033
OH, DR. BAILEY IS
FAR MORE EXPERIENCED THAN--

21:44.033 --> 21:46.806
SHE'S NOT TOUCHING ME.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.479
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME
SHE WON'T TOUCH ME.

21:49.479 --> 21:51.711
YOU CAN DO IT.

21:53.042 --> 21:56.546
SHE CAN'T.

21:59.789 --> 22:01.090
HEY.
(Owen) HEY.

22:01.090 --> 22:02.792
(Derek) HEY.

22:02.792 --> 22:05.094
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THE PRESENT I GOT FROM HUNT

22:05.094 --> 22:07.096
FOR BECOMING CHIEF?
FROM HUNT, HUH?

22:07.096 --> 22:09.098
I WAS GONNA GET YOU
ONE OF THOSE.
(chuckles)

22:09.098 --> 22:12.101
THE DELUXE VERSION. YOU KNOW,
THE KIND THAT KEEPS SCORE?

22:12.101 --> 22:14.664
NOT, UH, YOU KNOW,
THE CHEAPER ONE.
THAT'S MY CHAIR.

22:14.664 --> 22:18.368
I KNOW. I LIKE IT.
IT MAKES ME FEEL POWERFUL.
THAT WAS QUITE A SCENE

22:18.368 --> 22:20.870
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM
EARLIER.
OH, YOU SAW THAT.

22:20.870 --> 22:22.872
YEAH, THE WHOLE HOSPITAL DID.
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

22:22.872 --> 22:25.114
HOW'D YOU DETHRONE THE CHIEF
AND--AND WHY?
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

22:25.114 --> 22:28.347
NOT EVEN TO ME?
IT'S NOT MY STORY TO TELL.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.551
HEADS-UP.
LOOKS LIKE I'M FACING
A LAWSUIT.

22:31.551 --> 22:35.685
FIRST DAY OUT--PATIENT
WAKES UP ON THE TABLE.
YOU KNOW LEXIE
SLEPT WITH ALEX KAREV

22:35.685 --> 22:40.029
WHILE I WAS IN L.A.
DEALING WITH MY SICK DAUGHTER?
WELL, ACCORDING TO MEREDITH,

22:40.029 --> 22:42.492
YOU WERE DOING A LITTLE MORE
IN LOS ANGELES

22:42.492 --> 22:44.894
THAN JUST DEALING
WITH LITTLE SLOAN.
SHE DUMPED ME.

22:44.894 --> 22:47.837
WHICH IS WHY YOU WENT BACK
TO SLEEPING WITH MY EX-WIFE?
YOU SLEPT WITH HIS EX-WIFE?

22:47.837 --> 22:50.740
WAIT A SEC. YOU'RE REMARRIED.
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
I'M JUST SAYING,

22:50.740 --> 22:53.773
THE KAREV THING
IS FORGIVABLE CONSIDERING.
NOT TO ME.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.845
♪♪

22:55.845 --> 22:57.807
WHAT?
IS THAT A HICKEY?

22:57.807 --> 23:01.150
UH, IT'S, UH,
IT'S--IT'S A BIRTHMARK.
IT IS. IT'S A HICKEY.

23:01.150 --> 23:02.852
(Mark) YEAH.
(laughs)

23:02.852 --> 23:05.615
ALL RIGHT, CRISTINA AND I
HAVE BEEN... GETTING ALONG.

23:05.615 --> 23:07.617
WELL, YOU TWO
ARE GOOD TOGETHER.

23:07.617 --> 23:09.689
NOT LIKE ME AND LEXIE
OR...

23:09.689 --> 23:12.922
WAY BETTER
THAN YANG AND BURKE.
YEAH, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THOSE TWO.

23:12.922 --> 23:16.466
THEY WERE TOO...
MONOSYLLABIC.
YOU KNOW, I MADE A BET SHE'D
NEVER MAKE IT DOWN THAT AISLE.

23:16.466 --> 23:17.897
WON 50 BUCKS.
WHAT AISLE?

23:17.897 --> 23:20.169
OH, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT STORY? THAT'S A GOOD STORY.

23:20.169 --> 23:23.573
UH, IT'S NOT YOUR STORY
TO TELL.

23:29.078 --> 23:30.910
BAILEY IS LETTING ME OPERATE

23:30.910 --> 23:33.082
ON A POST-OP
INTERNAL BLEEDING PATIENT...

23:33.082 --> 23:35.785
BY MYSELF.

23:35.785 --> 23:37.947
DO YOU THINK
I CAN HANDLE IT?

23:40.750 --> 23:42.892
I THINK I CAN.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.498
DEREK TELLS ME
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT QUITTING.

23:52.732 --> 23:56.105
I THINK IF MY MOTHER
WERE HERE TO SEE THIS,

23:56.105 --> 24:00.740
SHE WOULD KICK YOUR ASS
FOR EVEN CONSIDERING IT.

24:06.816 --> 24:08.818
(door opens)

24:08.818 --> 24:10.820
(door closes)

24:10.820 --> 24:13.953
THESE LOOPS OF BOWEL
LOOK CLEAN, TOO.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.485
NOTHING.

24:15.485 --> 24:16.856
NOTHING.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.858
CRAP. I BULLIED THEM INTO
TOTALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERY

24:18.858 --> 24:20.159
FOR THEIR KID.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.632
NO, IT WASN'T UNNECESSARY.
BY NOT FINDING ANYTHING,

24:22.632 --> 24:25.134
WE'RE ONE STEP CLOSER TO FINDING
OUT WHAT ISN'T WRONG WITH BRAD,

24:25.134 --> 24:27.937
WHICH MEANS WE'RE ONE STEP
CLOSER TO FINDING WHAT IS.

24:27.937 --> 24:30.169
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA TELL

24:30.169 --> 24:32.141
HIS VERY ANGRY PARENTS.
ME?

24:32.141 --> 24:34.473
YEAH. YOU BULLIED 'EM
INTO SURGERY.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.607
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE HEAT.
MORE SUCTION, PLEASE.
(monitor beeps erratically)

24:37.607 --> 24:39.609
B.P. TOOK A DIP.
HE'S GETTING UNSTABLE.

24:39.609 --> 24:41.611
BOLUS HIM WITH A LITER,
AND LET'S GET HIM CLOSED.

24:41.611 --> 24:43.653
ALL RIGHT. WE MAY NOT
HAVE FOUND THE PROBLEM,

24:43.653 --> 24:45.655
BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

24:45.655 --> 24:48.988
(sighs) YOU KNOW...
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT SAYS

24:48.988 --> 24:50.990
YOU CAN'T OPERATE
ONCE SHE'S UNDER.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.623
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW.
I'M NOT OPERATING
ON A PATIENT

24:53.623 --> 24:55.525
WHO DOESN'T WANT ME
TO OPERATE ON HER.

24:55.525 --> 24:57.867
IF SHE WANTS A RESIDENT
DOING HER SURGERY,

24:57.867 --> 25:00.870
SHE GETS A RESIDENT
DOING HER SURGERY.

25:00.870 --> 25:02.231
I WOULDN'T LET YOU OPERATE

25:02.231 --> 25:04.233
UNLESS I THOUGHT
YOU COULD HANDLE IT.

25:04.233 --> 25:07.837
WELL, I COULD PERFORATE
HER BOWEL.
YOU WON'T!

25:09.909 --> 25:11.911
LOOK, I'LL BE WITH YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.013
HEY, DR. WEBBER
WAS MENTORING YOU.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.716
THERE'S NO REASON
WHY I CAN'T DO THE SAME.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.718
WELL, THE CHIEF
WASN'T EXACTLY MENTORING ME

25:18.718 --> 25:21.050
BECAUSE OF MY TALENT.
RICHARD WEBBER IS NOT A MAN

25:21.050 --> 25:23.052
WHO WASTES HIS TIME
ON JUST ANYBODY.

25:23.052 --> 25:25.895
THE LAST TIME HE MENTORED
A SURGEON, IT WAS ME.

25:25.895 --> 25:28.197
WHAT, YOU THINK
I DON'T HAVE TALENT?

25:28.197 --> 25:31.030
ALL RIGHT. WELL, HURRY UP
AND FINISH SCRUBBING IN.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.663
YOU'VE GOT
A PATIENT WAITING.

25:33.663 --> 25:36.806
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:36.806 --> 25:39.769
DO YOU REALLY THINK SHEPHERD'S
GONNA CUT ALL OF US?
WHAT?

25:39.769 --> 25:41.771
THE MERCY WESTERS--
DO YOU THINK WE'RE ALL GONE?

25:41.771 --> 25:43.272
I MEAN, JUST TELL ME

25:43.272 --> 25:45.544
IF YOU THINK THAT I NEED
TO START LOOKING FOR A JOB?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.277
IS THERE A REASON
OUR SON IS IN I.C.U.?
(woman) DID YOU
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG?

25:48.277 --> 25:52.081
UH, NOT EXACTLY.
WHY DOES HE HAVE A TUBE
IN HIS CHEST?

25:52.081 --> 25:54.083
YOU SAID YOU WERE DOING
ABDOMINAL SURGERY.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.856
BRAD BECAME
BRIEFLY UNSTABLE IN SURGERY,

25:56.856 --> 25:58.858
SO WE HAD TO PUT IN
A CENTRAL LINE.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.631
WELL, IT'S GOT A LITTLE KINK,
SO HIS LUNG, IT STARTED--
ALEX!

26:01.631 --> 26:03.793
HANG ON. ARE YOU SAYING YOU
CUT INTO OUR SON FOR NOTHING

26:03.793 --> 26:05.865
AND CAUSED MORE DAMAGE?
WAIT. WHAT?

26:05.865 --> 26:09.138
BLOOD. BLOOD. THERE IS A LOT
OF BLOOD IN THE CHEST TUBE.
WHAT? OH, MY GOD.

26:09.138 --> 26:12.702

AND SOME GLOVES.
HE'S ALREADY PUT OUT
700 cc's OF BLOOD.

26:12.702 --> 26:14.804

SIR, YOU NEED TO LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

26:14.804 --> 26:17.276
LIKE HELL WE'RE LEAVING.

WHAT'S GOING ON.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.609
HE'S CRASHING.

OH, MY GOD!

26:19.609 --> 26:21.951

26:21.951 --> 26:23.913

26:23.913 --> 26:28.087

26:30.089 --> 26:33.022
PLEASE LEAVE!
GET AWAY FROM OUR SON!

26:33.022 --> 26:36.195
(Reed) HE'S BRADYING DOWN.

26:44.373 --> 26:46.836

26:49.208 --> 26:52.682

THERE. I THINK I GOT IT.

26:52.682 --> 26:54.814
LET ME IN. WHAT HAPPENED?
HE PUT OUT
MORE THAN 2 LITERS OF BLOOD

26:54.814 --> 26:57.286
IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES,
BUT I THINK I FOUND THE SOURCE,

30:04.233 --> 30:07.206
SO I WAS TALKING TO LEXIE--
WH-WHY?

30:07.206 --> 30:09.208
WHEN? WHY ARE YOU
TALKING TO HER?

30:09.208 --> 30:12.111

AND ACTUALLY, SHE--
DON'T DO THIS.

30:12.111 --> 30:15.144
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, NOT HERS.
DON'T TAKE HER SIDE.
I'M NOT PICKING SIDES.

INTO BED WITH KAREV.

GOOD POINTS.

DISGUSTED?
HYPOCRITICAL,
