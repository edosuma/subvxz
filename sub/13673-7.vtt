WEBVTT

00:37.788 --> 00:39.528
In my 22 years as a judge,

00:39.665 --> 00:44.785
l have often felt obligated,
out of love and loyalty to New Orleans,

00:44.921 --> 00:49.585
to defend my city from those outsiders
who like to speak ill about it.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.799
Too many are quick to describe this city

00:51.928 --> 00:55.671
as a bastion of corruption,
of bureaucratic incompetence,

00:55.806 --> 00:58.934
of Southern laziness, of ineffectual policing

00:59.060 --> 01:02.427
and systemic dysfunction
within our legal system.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.059
No, I try to argue, the city is not that bad.

01:06.192 --> 01:09.309
Our reputation is grossly overblown.

01:09.445 --> 01:11.731
Yet here I sit

01:11.864 --> 01:15.231
with evidence indicating
that the Orleans Parish Prison

01:15.368 --> 01:18.360
had custody of a young man for six months,

01:18.496 --> 01:22.614
and during that same period,
denied this simple fact.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.206
Your Honor,

01:24.335 --> 01:26.747
records necessary to indicate
whether or not...

01:26.879 --> 01:30.337
I know, I know. They were undenNater
or the jail was flooded.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.206
That will be your line of argument.

01:32.343 --> 01:35.050
No doubt you will lean hard on it,
Miss Dufossat.

01:35.179 --> 01:38.467
But knowing that this young man
has been lost in the system,

01:38.599 --> 01:41.841
that many of our public figures
would rather he stay lost

01:41.978 --> 01:44.765
than to admit the obvious -
that there were fundamental problems

01:44.897 --> 01:49.641
with how ourjail inmates were handled
during the storm and its aftermath -

01:49.777 --> 01:54.020
I cannot put into words
the embarrassment | feel for us all.

01:56.701 --> 02:00.944
Ma'am, allow me to apologize
to you and your family

02:01.080 --> 02:04.868
on behalf of Orleans Parish
and the State of Louisiana.

02:05.001 --> 02:09.665
My sincerest regret for what
we have put your family through.

02:13.801 --> 02:17.510
Now, the Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parish

02:17.638 --> 02:22.382
and the Louisiana State
Department of Corrections have 72 hours

02:22.518 --> 02:27.057
to produce this young man,
or be held in contempt of this court.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.316
That's it. We're recessed.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.854
— (Gavel bangs)
— (Bailiff) All rise.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.308
George, that wasn't here last time.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.143
Don't let that stop us.

04:47.121 --> 04:51.114
Now once I'm set up in there,
you call the TV station,

04:51.250 --> 04:53.241
— let 'em know.
— Police too?

04:53.377 --> 04:56.915
— The reporters first and then the police.
— OK.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.205
(Creaking, clattering)

05:10.978 --> 05:14.311
Hm. Look at this.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.977
What'd | tell you?

05:17.109 --> 05:20.397
Some of the best—constructed
buildings in the city.

05:20.529 --> 05:24.613
Hm. A little bit of mold and dust.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.482
But othenNise...

05:28.662 --> 05:30.368
You sure your mama's all right with this, Ronnie?

05:30.498 --> 05:32.284
No, she don't mind. As a matter of fact,

05:35.169 --> 05:36.750
What else you gonna need, Chief?

05:36.879 --> 05:38.835
I'm gonna need a new bolt lock on that door.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.249
You got it.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.634
You can call me if you need
something to eat, Chief.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.466
Mm—hm.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.711
My niece left that.

05:46.847 --> 05:50.385
"Times are not good here."

05:50.518 --> 05:52.054
Sound familiar?

05:52.186 --> 05:54.848
1880, remember.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.141
"The city is crumbling into ashes.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.890
"It has been buried
under a lava flood of taxes

06:00.027 --> 06:03.645
"and frauds and maladministrations."

06:03.781 --> 06:05.442
Well...

06:05.574 --> 06:07.735
The more things change...

06:07.868 --> 06:08.983
(Chuckling)

06:09.119 --> 06:10.859
"lts condition is so bad

06:10.996 --> 06:14.488
"that when | write about it,
nobody will believe I'm telling the truth."

06:14.625 --> 06:16.411
And here's the kicker.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.660
"But it is better to live here

06:18.796 --> 06:21.333
"in sackcloth and ashes

06:21.465 --> 06:24.332
"than it is to own the whole state of Ohio."

06:24.468 --> 06:26.550
(Students chuckling)

06:26.679 --> 06:30.012
Some of you are doubtless from Ohio.
You know what he's talking about.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.387
Lafcadio Hearn was not the first man
to fall in love with New Orleans.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.182
Certainly he wasn't the last.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.600
lts frauds and farces

06:39.733 --> 06:44.022
represent some of America's
worst excesses and affronts.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.567
But...

06:47.700 --> 06:49.236
day by day,

06:49.368 --> 06:51.359
year by year,

06:51.495 --> 06:56.455
New Orleans also conjures
moments of artistic clarity

06:56.584 --> 06:57.949
and urban transcendence

06:58.085 --> 07:02.124
that are the best that Americans
as a people can hope for.

07:03.966 --> 07:07.049
That is if we who bear witness to them

07:07.177 --> 07:11.386
are not too jaded, too spent

07:11.515 --> 07:15.758
and too stupid to recognize them

07:15.894 --> 07:17.885
for what they are.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.730
(J‘ Band playing)

07:40.628 --> 07:43.415
(Antoine) All right, all right. Yeah.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.414
Thank you. Thank you, world travelers.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.757
— Basin Street?
— Yeah, that'll work.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.877
On you, Jack.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.924
- One, two...
— Excuse me, sir.

07:53.057 --> 07:55.218
- Whoa.
— Who are you playing for today?

07:55.351 --> 07:56.716
Ma'am?

07:56.852 --> 07:58.968
Is there someone special flying in?

07:59.104 --> 08:01.481
(Chuckles) Are you from New Orleans, ma'am?

08:01.607 --> 08:03.848
Yes, all my life.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.101
Well, ma'am, I believe we are here for you.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.272
Oh.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.657
(Clicking fingers) One, two...

08:10.783 --> 08:12.819
Uh, uh, tell it, Jack.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.942
(Trumpet plays intro)

08:38.977 --> 08:41.764
— (Bell tinkles)
— Jingle jangle, jingle jangle.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.604
— (Music playing over speakers)
— Cha—ching!

08:44.733 --> 08:46.974
Another 60 units for you, bro.

08:47.111 --> 08:48.601
I said we'd take a whole box.

08:48.737 --> 08:52.150
And a whole box I shall deliver
as soon as | get my next thousand.

08:52.282 --> 08:56.821
Dude, second pressing.
I've never sold a thousand of anything.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.161
Well, you've moved 720 through us already.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.120
What?

09:03.001 --> 09:04.411
Holy shit.

09:04.545 --> 09:08.333
- $2500?
— Yeah.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.423
When your next shipment drops,
you should come in and sign a few copies.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.134
Yeah. Hey, how about
an in—store performance,

09:14.263 --> 09:16.720
— me and my band?
- That too.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.890
— Thanks, man.
— Have a good day.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.053
Well, I might take your walk—in cooler,

09:24.189 --> 09:27.477
depending upon the dimensions.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.941
And the silvenNare, the flatware

09:30.070 --> 09:32.732
and the tablecloths I can definitely use.

09:32.865 --> 09:35.948
Spoken like a man getting ready
to open yet another restaurant.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.692
(Chuckles) It's a bad habit.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.992
So how are you feeling? You all right?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.535
(Sighs)

09:44.668 --> 09:47.831
To be honest,
the stress was making my hair fall out.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.624
| just want to catch my breath.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.622
You gonna stay here in New Orleans?

09:51.759 --> 09:54.375
Believe it or not, my SBA loan check
finally came through.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.422
Too little, too late for the restaurant,

09:56.555 --> 09:59.092
but I bought a trailer

09:59.224 --> 10:01.681
with a two—burner, grill, smoker.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.425
No shit.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.473
Do the guerrilla—chef thing for a while.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.348
No overhead, no reservations,
no fucking mortgage.

10:08.484 --> 10:10.520
Just pull up to whatever nightclub or bar

10:10.652 --> 10:12.938
will have me for the weekend,
cook my ass off.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.323
I'm a pirate on the high seas.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.360
You can't keep a good cook down.

10:20.162 --> 10:23.245
(Davis) My only mistake
was not running for mayor!

10:23.373 --> 10:24.874
'Cause, you know,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.582
the city council isn't much of a platform

10:27.711 --> 10:30.293
to really move records.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.162
— Here you go.
— Thanks, Davis.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.800
Sit.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.917
— Where?
— I don't know.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.968
So...so how do I follow this up?

10:42.100 --> 10:44.716
See, you have a chance
to focus on a few key issues.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.560
Nagin, Mitch,
they're not talking about the real issues.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.431
Real...real issues. That.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.309
The notion of a smaller New Orleans,
a smaller footprint.

10:53.445 --> 10:57.029
Charity Hospital's still closed.
They put up fences around the projects.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.988
Whole neighborhoods are being written off.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.904
Nagin's talking about "chocolate city",
but he's not pressing the feds

11:02.037 --> 11:03.698
to bring anybody home, no one is.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.322
— Definitely not.
— And why won't the feds move?

11:06.458 --> 11:07.914
Because...

11:09.920 --> 11:11.251
Because...

11:11.380 --> 11:13.587
if New Orleans gets whiter,

11:13.715 --> 11:15.876
the state slides from purple to red.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.751
So we write a song

11:18.887 --> 11:21.264
about the smaller footprint.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.006
The culture of New Orleans,
that's what's at risk.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.678
If they knock out the infrastructure

11:25.811 --> 11:28.302
that sustains the culture,
then it's gone forever.

11:28.438 --> 11:33.148
Infrastructure. Exactly.
Sustain...sustaining culture.

11:33.277 --> 11:36.360
Man, you could hide a dead hooker in here
and no one would know.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.319
lnf. ..infrastructure.

11:38.448 --> 11:42.032
(Muttering rhythmically)

11:43.453 --> 11:44.488
So, um,

11:44.621 --> 11:47.738
nothing really rhymes with "infrastructure."

11:47.875 --> 11:52.118
A bill a man as promised.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.586
What the fuck is this?

11:54.715 --> 11:56.956
It's what's called a check
made out in your name.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.923
Take it to your bank and cash it, baby.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.215
My bank? Fuck I look like,
Thurston Howell or some shit?

12:02.347 --> 12:05.259
You need to be paying us
like musicians, man. Cash money.

12:05.392 --> 12:09.351
Look, this is how the clinic is doing this here, so calm the
fuck down.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.845
— With a share for Danny.
— What, now?

12:11.982 --> 12:14.098
— That's bullshit.
— Danny didn't show, man.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.974
— He took ill.
— He did?

12:16.111 --> 12:19.478
But if it wasn't for his name, we wouldn't
even have gotten this gig, all right?

12:19.615 --> 12:23.028
Last time a motherfucker tried
to hand me a bank check, 1988.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.868
(Vehicle approaching)

12:38.091 --> 12:39.922
There's a break in the fence over there.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.509
— You the one who called?
— I am.

12:42.638 --> 12:44.094
(Man) Going live in 30.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.928
(Dialing)

12:47.684 --> 12:50.096
— (Woman) Information, how may I help you?
— New Orleans Police Department?

12:50.228 --> 12:53.436
- Emergency or not?
— Not an emergency, I guess.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.683
(Piano and fiddle playing)

13:19.633 --> 13:22.841
J‘ Days been dark

13:22.970 --> 13:25.382
J‘ Since you been gone

13:28.475 --> 13:30.932
J‘ Won't you please

13:31.061 --> 13:34.303
J‘ Come and shine a light?

13:34.439 --> 13:37.602
Wow, when you get the other buskers
to contribute, you've really done something.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.019
— That's true.
— How are you?

13:39.152 --> 13:43.270
I'm good. Iwas just thinking, I might know some boys who
need a fiddle player.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.068
Really?

13:49.788 --> 13:51.369
(Song ends)

13:51.498 --> 13:54.114
— Just holler at me later on.
- All right.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.367
I will. Thanks so much. Thanks.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.118
(Applause)

13:58.255 --> 13:59.836
Thank you.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.456
— What's up?
- Nothing.

14:06.471 --> 14:11.966
It don't make sense for the government
to shut down 5,000 housing units,

14:12.102 --> 14:14.514
most of it undamaged by the storm,

14:14.646 --> 14:16.432
when people can't get home.

14:16.565 --> 14:20.228
— Are you hoping to be arrested?
- (Siren approaching)

14:20.360 --> 14:22.817
— I expect to be.
— (Man) Here they come!

14:22.946 --> 14:25.653
It's either that, or I expect them

14:25.782 --> 14:27.943
to reopen the Calliope.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.567
Now if y'all will excuse me?

14:30.704 --> 14:32.615
(Man) Get that.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.754
— You gotta get these cameras gone.
— Officer, what...

14:46.887 --> 14:49.503
If I ask you again, you're gonna
take a charge, understand?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.846
— Yes, sir.
— (Man) Get me a wide shot.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.431
— You got that?
— All of it.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.596
— Are we rolling?
- (Banging)

14:56.480 --> 14:57.515
Sir?

14:57.647 --> 15:00.810
Sir, these buildings are closed.
You can't be here.

15:00.942 --> 15:03.024
Now would you step out, please?

15:03.153 --> 15:05.018
Need a place to stay.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.362
Somewhere else, not here.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.982
No need to yell through the door.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.363
Sir, you need to vacate
these apartments now.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.287
So how about you grab
whatever you need to take and let's go?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.375
I'm not leaving.

15:21.505 --> 15:24.542
You know you're trespassing
and we'll lock you up?

15:24.674 --> 15:27.290
This unit belongs to Pearline Cross.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.339
I'm not trespassing.
I'm here with her permission.

15:30.472 --> 15:33.054
This unit don't belong to Pearline Cross.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.549
It belongs to the Housing Authority
of New Orleans.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.892
We need you to step outside.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.229
What's your name, sir?

15:45.362 --> 15:47.853
Big Chief Albert Lambreaux,

15:47.989 --> 15:50.856
- Guardians of the Flame.
— (Man) ..Calliope projects,

15:50.992 --> 15:53.074
and the NOPD have just arrived on scene...

15:57.541 --> 15:59.281
(Woman over PA) Dr. Lee to neuro consult.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.705
Dr. Lee, please report to neurology
for a consult.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.710
(Monitors beeping faintly)

16:18.562 --> 16:20.553
(Blood pressure monitor whirring)

16:32.409 --> 16:35.947
(PA) Dr. Johnson to radiology.
Dr. Johnson, radiology.

17:01.062 --> 17:05.431
(J‘ Jelly Roll Morton: I Thought I Heard
Buddy Bolden Say, playing over earphones)

17:24.961 --> 17:27.668
(Muttering)

17:29.299 --> 17:31.415
Piece of shit.

17:55.992 --> 17:59.280
Pine Leaf Boys out of Lafayette.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.028
Wilson Savoy, the accordion player,

18:02.165 --> 18:05.157
— he's a buddy of mine.
— The Pine Leaf Boys.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.660
Cajun band, gettin' ready
for a three—week Canadian tour.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.504
You could be a Pine Leaf Girl
for a few weeks.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.214
You interested?

18:13.343 --> 18:15.959
Cajun violin? I...

18:16.096 --> 18:18.712
(Sighs) You're right.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.509
You'll probably suck.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.133
They probably won't hire you.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.555
Or not.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.679
What have you got to lose, anyway?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.690
A three—week tour, huh?

18:34.406 --> 18:36.692
I gotta talk to Sonny.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.361
I figured.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.236
Albert?

18:50.588 --> 18:52.920
— Police ain't give you no hassle?
— No.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.256
They just let us come
straight up in here.

18:55.385 --> 18:58.172
— Mm—hm.
— If they ain't locked you up yet,

18:58.305 --> 19:00.170
— maybe they don't intend to.
- No.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.719
They waitin' for the right time.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.718
Maybe they hoping those TV people
will go away first.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.765
Where you want me to set this up, Chief?

19:07.897 --> 19:09.808
Right here under the window.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.432
Shit, if I'm going to be here a while,

19:12.569 --> 19:15.311
I better figure out something new
to say to them TV crews.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.938
Man, you was all over the news last night.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.451
This morning, too.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.944
Shit, maybe we can really
turn up the heat on these politicians, huh?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.617
— Mm.
— (Generator whirring)

19:26.750 --> 19:29.116
(Franklin) Looky here, Chief!

19:31.087 --> 19:32.748
You gotta see this one here.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.047
Well, who the fuck is that?

19:40.180 --> 19:43.672
I don't know,
but somebody else got balls too.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.059
(Laughing)

19:45.185 --> 19:48.803
Damn, Chief, see what you started?

19:48.938 --> 19:51.475
Three weeks in Canada?

19:51.608 --> 19:54.350
— In support of their album.
- Mm.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.977
They sell big in Quebec.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.604
Cajuns like to play with other Cajuns.

19:59.741 --> 20:03.154
I know, I'm surprised
to even be getting the audition.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.528
You know Harley from Frenchmen Street?

20:06.664 --> 20:10.031
I think he talked me up
with some friends of his in the band.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.159
(Helicopters overhead)

20:16.049 --> 20:19.587
What am I gonna do
without you for three weeks?

20:19.719 --> 20:23.837
— Sonny?
— If you want to do it, you should do it.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.428
I'll wait for you to come home.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.771
What else am I gonna say?

21:07.475 --> 21:08.760
(Mouths)

21:30.373 --> 21:32.705
— Batiste.
— Troy, my man.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.371
— Where you coming from?
— From the Portland Jazz Fest.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.791
Ah, yeah, you know,
this ain't no jazz festival or even a club,

21:38.923 --> 21:40.504
but, you know, pays the bills, bro.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.965
— One of them clinic gigs, huh?
- Yeah.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.301
— A bill a man. But hey, it's work.
- Hell, yeah.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.263
Plus people need to hear y'all
coming through this airport, for real.

21:48.391 --> 21:49.801
Yeah.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.799
Y'all want to blow something, man?

21:51.936 --> 21:54.894
— No, James, you ain't got to do that, bro.
- Yeah, let's do something.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.763
— Let's do something.
- Yeah, all right.

21:56.900 --> 22:01.018
— Y'all follow me on this, huh?
— All right, all right. Over here.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.894
We ain't got to split this nine ways?

22:03.031 --> 22:06.273
(Antoine) No, baby, we ain't splitting shit.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.409
Come on now. We'll follow you, bro.

22:10.538 --> 22:13.245
J‘ Yo—oh
J‘ Yo—oh

22:13.625 --> 22:15.786
J‘ Yo—oh
J‘ Yo—oh

22:15.919 --> 22:17.875
J‘ Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

22:18.004 --> 22:21.087
J‘ Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

22:21.216 --> 22:24.424
J‘ I want to tell you about ooh poo pah doo

22:26.721 --> 22:30.134
J‘ They call me the most
J‘ They call me the most

22:30.266 --> 22:33.724
J‘ My ooh poo pah doo, yeah, yeah

22:33.853 --> 22:38.017
J‘ I say they call me the most
J‘ They call me the most

22:38.149 --> 22:43.109
J‘ I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh J‘

22:56.668 --> 22:58.329
(Sighs)

23:07.470 --> 23:08.926
OK.

23:21.609 --> 23:25.022
J‘ They call me the most,
they call me the most

23:25.154 --> 23:30.694
- (Trombone blaring)
— J‘ I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

23:31.452 --> 23:33.317
J‘ My ooh poo pah doo

23:33.454 --> 23:36.742
(Both playing loudly, trumpet blaring)

23:57.812 --> 24:02.602
J‘ I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

24:02.734 --> 24:05.066
J‘ My ooh poo pah doo

24:05.194 --> 24:09.608
J‘ I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

24:10.408 --> 24:12.023
J‘ My ooh poo pah doo

24:13.286 --> 24:17.825
J‘ I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

24:17.957 --> 24:22.667
— J‘ My ooh poo pah doo J‘
- Yeah!

24:22.795 --> 24:24.956
Yeah!

24:26.424 --> 24:28.881
Welcome to New Orleans, y'all!

24:29.010 --> 24:30.500
— Hey!
— Lovely!

24:30.637 --> 24:32.753
— Yeah!
— Whoo!

24:34.140 --> 24:36.051
(Man) Police were drawn
to this housing project

24:36.184 --> 24:39.176
because a Mardi Gras Indian chief
cut through this fence behind me

24:39.312 --> 24:40.973
and occupied a unit over there.

24:41.105 --> 24:45.644
Now this Indian chief says he will not leave until these
apartments are reopened.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.938
— Earlier today, Albert Lambreaux...
- There you go.

24:48.071 --> 24:52.064
..a chief with one of the downtown
Indian tribes, had this to say.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.657
What sense does it make
for the government

24:54.786 --> 24:57.198
— to be sitting on all this housing...
- Yes, sir.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.288
— ..when so many people can't get home?
— That's right.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.623
(Albert) I need somebody to explain that to me.

25:02.752 --> 25:05.209
And now others
have taken up the protest as well,

25:05.338 --> 25:07.624
with squatters setting up
in two other buildings...

25:07.757 --> 25:10.624
— That's what I'm talking about.
— ..here at the BW Cooper project,

25:10.760 --> 25:14.173
and others, cutting a hole through the fence
of the St. Bernard complex

25:14.305 --> 25:16.591
and occupying two units over there.

25:16.724 --> 25:20.683
(Singing with CD) J‘ Shame, shame, shame
what you have done

25:22.021 --> 25:24.637
J‘ We was on the ropes,
we were down and out

25:24.774 --> 25:27.641
J‘ You flew on over, never did come down

25:27.777 --> 25:31.486
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
on you now, Dubya

25:32.949 --> 25:36.942
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
on you now, Dubya J‘

25:40.748 --> 25:42.784
(Davis) Oh, no.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.760
Cray?

26:08.109 --> 26:10.191
Creighton?

26:23.875 --> 26:24.955
(Toni sighs)

26:25.084 --> 26:28.702
You're working on the novel. That's great.

26:28.838 --> 26:31.375
What are you doing out here?
What's wrong with the study?

26:31.507 --> 26:33.043
(Groans)

26:33.176 --> 26:35.167
Have you eaten yet?
You wanna go out for a bite?

26:35.303 --> 26:36.964
Toni! Shh!

26:46.397 --> 26:48.353
(Man outside) Chief Lambreaux?

26:48.483 --> 26:50.064
(Knock at door)

26:50.193 --> 26:52.559
(People shouting outside)
Hell, no! We won't go!

26:53.821 --> 26:56.688
Let 'em know, Big Chief! Let 'em know!

26:58.743 --> 27:02.702
Chief Lambreaux,
you mind if I come in and talk?

27:02.830 --> 27:05.663
If you can find it in yourself
not to lock me up,

27:05.792 --> 27:09.159
I can find it in myself
to welcome you to my home.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.001
You have my word.

27:15.718 --> 27:19.256
(Man) Let's go, Chief! Chief's on that fiyo!

27:19.388 --> 27:22.255
Kind of a half—assed stand—off,
if you ask me.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.676
(Locks door)

27:23.810 --> 27:26.722
My people come and go as they please.

27:26.854 --> 27:29.266
We're not looking
to start anything here with y'all.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.934
Mm.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.309
You look disappointed.

27:35.905 --> 27:40.069
I'm Sergeant Maurice Thompson,
Community Relations Division.

27:40.201 --> 27:42.066
Community Relations?

27:42.203 --> 27:45.195
That's nice. How can I help you, Sergeant?

27:45.915 --> 27:49.123
Well, the mayor's office
and Council President Thomas,

27:49.252 --> 27:53.165
they sent me here to say they want
to resolve this without any real conflict.

27:53.297 --> 27:57.506
Well, that's easily done. Open the projects.

27:57.635 --> 28:00.798
Federal government's got control
of these projects.

28:00.930 --> 28:03.967
- You know this.
— Yeah, they keep saying.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.558
It don't make no sense
that nobody in New Orleans

28:07.687 --> 28:09.268
is fighting the feds on this one.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.264
What does that tell you?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.729
If people wanted
the housing projects to reopen...

28:15.862 --> 28:17.523
I mean if voters wanted it,

28:17.655 --> 28:21.694
you'd see the politicians
falling all over each other to demand it.

28:21.826 --> 28:23.737
But the people who vote in this town,

28:23.870 --> 28:26.452
black and white both,
they've been awfully quiet

28:26.581 --> 28:30.039
on this thing so far, don't you think?

28:30.167 --> 28:33.330
Now if you want to spend another night here
to drive your point home,

28:33.462 --> 28:35.714
we ain't gonna bother you.

28:35.840 --> 28:40.425
Come tomorrow afternoon, we're gonna
have to treat this as a criminal trespass.

28:41.637 --> 28:44.014
And you and anyone in here with you

28:44.140 --> 28:45.971
is going to jail.

28:50.980 --> 28:53.392
Well, thank you for your visit, Sergeant.

28:57.278 --> 28:59.564
And come again.

29:05.912 --> 29:09.496
(Woman over PA) Dr. Koch to the ER,
Dr. Koch to the ER.

29:26.766 --> 29:29.007
(PA) Paging Dr. Wasserman.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.179
(Playing along with recording)

29:44.533 --> 29:46.694
(Fast—fonNarding)

30:06.722 --> 30:08.508
(Toni) Hi.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.848
Coffee.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.387
Set it down.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.602
Oh, you got some pages done.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.891
— They're shit.
- Can I read?

30:17.024 --> 30:19.982
Why would you want to read it
if I just told you they were shit?

30:20.903 --> 30:24.020
What the fuck am I doing here anyway?

30:24.156 --> 30:25.862
I don't even know.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.574
Maybe you want to leave this alone
until after Mardi Gras.

30:28.703 --> 30:31.945
— Will I be 20 years younger after Mardi Gras?
— What?

30:32.081 --> 30:35.699
Toni, just let me do my work,
will you, please?

30:44.135 --> 30:46.091
(Man speaking French)

30:51.100 --> 30:53.341
Mademoiselle.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.932
I made your favorite. Crab bisque.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.355
You are sweet.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.395
This is my neighbor Souleymane.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.314
— Chef Janette.
— How are you, Chef?

31:04.447 --> 31:06.438
— Nice to meet you.
— Nice to meet you.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.815
This is your new kitchen!

31:08.951 --> 31:12.819
Yeah. No staff, no silvenNare.
Just me and my propane.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.536
Wow. (Laughs)

31:14.665 --> 31:17.407
(Laughs) I'm gonna be at Bacchanal
this weekend.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.000
I could use a hand,
if you want to have an adventure.

31:20.129 --> 31:24.247
Very kind of you to offer,
but I'm working the grill at Bayona.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.669
— Oh, Jacques, that's great.
- Yeah.

31:26.802 --> 31:29.635
Oh, I knew you'd get snapped up.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.300
Well, it won't be the same.

31:31.432 --> 31:33.844
You know they'll probably
pay you more than I could afford.

31:33.976 --> 31:36.718
— You'll be making what you're worth.
— But not the same.

31:36.854 --> 31:38.310
Yeah.

31:41.317 --> 31:44.184
Here's a copy of the order
signed by Judge Gatling.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.937
Well, your timing's pretty good anyway.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.360
The state just completed this
a few weeks back.

31:50.493 --> 31:54.406
Every Orleans Parish prisoner
currently housed outside the parish.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.324
Photographs and fingerprints.

31:56.457 --> 31:59.369
— Every one?
- 527 total.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.458
We need to look at every face.

32:01.587 --> 32:05.876
I need you to fill out this form indicating that you won't
disclose any confidential information

32:06.008 --> 32:08.124
except as a means of locating Mr. Brooks.

32:08.260 --> 32:12.424
You can tell the sheriff
his ass is fully covered.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.842
Hope you find him, ma'am. I truly mean that.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.182
Thank you, Deputy.

32:18.562 --> 32:21.144
Let's do this. Let's get it done.

32:25.152 --> 32:28.144
— (Phone ringing)
— (Radio) One—nine. Ten—four.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.201
Ten—four. Two—fifty. We have...

32:49.176 --> 32:50.507
Davis McAlary.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.217
Judge Williams.

32:52.346 --> 32:53.927
I am indeed.

32:54.056 --> 32:57.344
Wow, summoned to lunch
by a New Orleans judge.

32:57.476 --> 33:01.014
— I'm a fan. I hope you'll sign that for me.
- No problem.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.433
You've been having fun
the last few weeks, Davis.

33:03.566 --> 33:07.104
That business of Greased Palm Sunday.

33:07.236 --> 33:10.774
Of course not everyone thinks
of the election as a joke.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.362
I don't think it's a joke.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.776
(Laughs)

33:13.909 --> 33:15.740
How long have you lived in New Orleans?

33:15.870 --> 33:17.701
You've sold some CDs.

33:17.830 --> 33:20.037
Now, don't you think it's time to stand down,

33:20.166 --> 33:25.456
let the people of District C focus
on the serious choice they have to make?

33:25.588 --> 33:27.249
Oh, it's on me.

33:28.257 --> 33:31.966
Uh, trout Baquet, a side of red beans
and a Budweiser.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.210
The gumbo for me, with iced tea.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.257
Wait, Judge, I'm confused.

33:36.390 --> 33:38.301
Why exactly are you buying me lunch?

33:38.434 --> 33:41.642
Because, Davis,
it's a horse race in District C,

33:41.770 --> 33:43.977
and you're siphoning votes
from the candidate

33:44.106 --> 33:46.267
that our organization is supporting.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.766
Whose poll shows that?

33:49.778 --> 33:51.279
Jeez.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.030
What? 4.3%?

33:55.159 --> 33:57.992
Most of which comes
at the expense of our man.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.235
Which is who?

33:59.371 --> 34:01.578
Your little musicale

34:01.707 --> 34:05.165
can mean the difference
between him being in the runoff or not.

34:05.294 --> 34:09.458
So I am here to offer you something.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.251
A bribe?

34:11.383 --> 34:13.248
Sweet!

34:13.385 --> 34:14.921
You know what that is?

34:15.054 --> 34:17.966
— A business card.
— No, Davis.

34:18.098 --> 34:21.511
That is a "get out ofjail free" card.

34:21.644 --> 34:24.010
Next time you find yourself in trouble,

34:24.146 --> 34:27.263
and you being a musician,
we know there's always a next time,

34:27.399 --> 34:29.355
you call Judge Williams.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.225
That's my cell number on the back.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.196
Wait, so you're saying

34:36.325 --> 34:38.611
if...if I quit the city council race...

34:38.744 --> 34:41.076
Then you have a new friend.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.032
Do we have a deal?

34:50.381 --> 34:51.837
Yes.

34:52.883 --> 34:57.217
(Violin playing, tuning)

34:57.346 --> 34:59.382
What's up, y'all?

34:59.515 --> 35:01.471
Thanks for giving me a shot, guys.

35:01.600 --> 35:06.060
Oh, no problem. Harley there said you're pretty good at that
country stuff. So let's jam.

35:06.188 --> 35:07.974
He's being kind.

35:08.107 --> 35:11.099
Well, Cedric's my number—one call
when it comes to Pine Leaf gigs,

35:11.235 --> 35:14.727
but from time to time he's out with
Eddie Poullard and we need a sub.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.728
And being a girl ain't gonna hurt nothing.

35:16.865 --> 35:20.073
Well, I hope I can do itjustice.

35:20.911 --> 35:24.699
Well, how about we try Homage A Poullard?

35:24.832 --> 35:26.368
All right, let's do it.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.367
(Accordion playing, drum thumping)

35:57.781 --> 36:00.158
(Playing goes out of time)

36:04.788 --> 36:07.120
I think I'm missing the one.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.285
- I'm sorry.
— It's a little tricky.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.750
Yeah, I'll show you where to come in. Watch.

36:21.722 --> 36:23.007
(Man) Whoo!

36:28.020 --> 36:29.851
(Playing out of time)

36:41.867 --> 36:45.109
I'm sorry, guys. I'm playing terrible.

36:45.245 --> 36:48.658
It's not about the notes.
It's about the feeling of the music.

36:48.791 --> 36:51.282
I know I can play better than this.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.293
I'm just guessing now, but...

36:55.422 --> 36:58.038
you have trouble in your heart?

36:58.175 --> 37:00.416
Yeah, a little bit.

37:00.552 --> 37:04.340
Well, why don't you get it together
and we'll hear you another time?

37:04.473 --> 37:05.804
Yeah.

37:05.933 --> 37:08.800
Don't worry about it.
Don't even worry about it.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.847
— (Radio chatter)
— This can't be all of them.

37:14.983 --> 37:18.601
If Daymo was in custody,
his photo would be here

37:18.737 --> 37:20.648
under any name in any parish.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.066
We would have seen his photo.

37:22.199 --> 37:25.032
So where is he, then?
Are they hiding him from us?

37:25.160 --> 37:27.993
No, they don't want a judge
to hold them in contempt.

37:28.122 --> 37:29.987
Then what?

37:35.504 --> 37:37.711
If he'd been released...

37:37.840 --> 37:41.753
He would have come home.
He would have called Mama.

37:52.396 --> 37:55.763
Deputy, is there a master list
of OPP inmates

37:55.899 --> 37:58.356
who died in custody since Katrina?

37:58.485 --> 37:59.986
I can get it.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.444
Might take me a little time,
but I can get it for you.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.564
Please.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.865
(Crowd chanting) We deserve a home!
We deserve a home!

38:15.002 --> 38:17.664
(Franklin) They getting ready
to do something.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.502
(Albert) Mm.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.133
Y'all fellas got to leave.

38:22.259 --> 38:25.877
— Nobody leaving.
— We got what we came here for.

38:26.013 --> 38:29.221
It's time for me to do that jail walk
and drive the point home.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.971
Just go home. Keep sewing.

38:34.104 --> 38:36.846
Mardi Gras won't wait.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.224
And be there with my bail money tomorrow.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.066
A'ight?

38:42.196 --> 38:44.608
(Crowd) We deserve a home!
We deserve a home!

38:44.740 --> 38:46.731
(Chanting continues)

38:49.077 --> 38:52.490
We deserve a home!
We deserve a home!

38:54.750 --> 38:58.584
Apparently, the original protester,
Albert Lambreaux...

38:58.712 --> 39:00.577
(Man) Y'all weren't doing nothing wrong.
Go back in there!

39:00.714 --> 39:02.670
(Crowd booing)

39:04.218 --> 39:06.209
Fuck the police!

39:12.809 --> 39:15.346
(Angry shouting)

39:23.612 --> 39:25.273
(Man) It's time to end this!

39:25.405 --> 39:27.532
Will you vacate
or do we have to take the door down?

39:27.658 --> 39:29.444
(Albert) It's unlocked.

39:29.576 --> 39:31.077
Will you step outside?

39:31.203 --> 39:33.990
- (Generator off)
— No, sir, Iwill not.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.707
Down on your knees, hands on your head.
You're under arrest.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.882
On your knees, hands on your head.
You're under arrest.

39:47.010 --> 39:50.673
I won't kneel down.
You want to handcuff me? Go ahead.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.842
Motherfucker, you don't decide
how you go to jail.

39:52.975 --> 39:56.433
We decide how you go to jail.
On your fucking knees.

39:56.562 --> 39:59.269
— No hoom—bow.
— (Man) Oh, yeah.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.389
Fuck that Injun shit.

40:08.532 --> 40:11.695
Stop resisting! Stop resisting!

40:12.703 --> 40:14.910
Stay down! Stay down!

40:15.038 --> 40:16.539
He won't be here under his own name.

40:16.665 --> 40:19.407
I've checked with DMORT
every week since the storm.

40:19.543 --> 40:20.874
So how we gonna know, then?

40:21.003 --> 40:24.370
He might be a John Doe
or under a different name. I don't know.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.497
You ready to do this?

40:37.686 --> 40:39.517
That's my cousin's name.

40:45.277 --> 40:46.983
Jerome Cherry.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.854
And he ain't dead.
I seen him over Christmas.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.191
LaDonna, has Daymo
ever used your cousin's name?

40:54.328 --> 40:55.283
What?

40:55.412 --> 40:57.323
What if Daymo said he was Jerome Cherry?

40:57.456 --> 40:58.616
Why would he do that?

40:58.749 --> 41:01.536
Maybe he thought taking another name
would get him released,

41:01.668 --> 41:03.624
like Keevon White did to him.

41:03.754 --> 41:06.746
Your cousin Jerome has never been
in trouble with the law, I bet.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.839
Boy was damn near raised in a church.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.426
You see? Daymo got locked up
because there was a bench warrant

41:13.555 --> 41:15.466
on David Maurice Brooks.

41:15.599 --> 41:17.555
After he lost his wristband,

41:17.684 --> 41:19.675
maybe he gave himself another name,

41:19.811 --> 41:22.723
one with no criminal record.

41:25.275 --> 41:29.439
That says, "Family notified.
Body unclaimed."

41:29.571 --> 41:31.232
Mm—hm.

41:31.365 --> 41:33.321
What family?

41:33.450 --> 41:35.156
Who'd they notify?

41:36.203 --> 41:38.569
I don't understand what the fuck's going on.

41:38.705 --> 41:43.074
They got my brother's body somewhere
under somebody else's name?

41:43.210 --> 41:45.121
We can't know for sure.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.790
We'll drive over to DMORT tomorrow.

41:47.923 --> 41:50.005
In St. Gabriel?

41:50.133 --> 41:52.124
No, they moved it to Carville,

41:52.260 --> 41:54.546
70 miles west of us.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.921
LaDonna?

41:57.933 --> 42:00.640
We're gonna have to look at this body.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.815
(Knocking)

42:09.945 --> 42:11.856
(Janette) Coming.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.944
Hold on.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.613
I cooked for you.

42:22.749 --> 42:26.958
Stuffed mirlitons, spinach salad
and a bottle of Malbec.

42:28.004 --> 42:29.790
You went by the restaurant, huh?

42:30.507 --> 42:32.088
Why didn't you tell me?

42:32.217 --> 42:34.208
What is there to say?

42:35.387 --> 42:37.673
Janette, I'm sorry.

42:37.806 --> 42:41.344
Yeah, no more free meals at the bar.

42:42.602 --> 42:44.558
I'm sorry for you, darlin'.

43:01.997 --> 43:04.238
Christ. (Laughs)

43:04.374 --> 43:07.036
Oh, yeah, still no electric down here,

43:07.169 --> 43:10.002
no drywall, nobody doing any work on it at all.

43:10.756 --> 43:14.248
I guess I should be embarrassed,
living like this.

43:14.384 --> 43:16.841
I'm not company, Janette. I'm your friend.

43:17.846 --> 43:19.427
With benefits.

43:19.556 --> 43:21.763
With or without.

43:25.020 --> 43:26.851
Come on.

43:26.980 --> 43:28.936
We can eat upstairs.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.940
(Printer whirring)

43:38.200 --> 43:39.781
OK.

43:44.206 --> 43:45.992
Ahem.

43:48.210 --> 43:50.417
Creighton Bernette here,
still in New Orleans,

43:50.545 --> 43:52.536
which is still where you left it.

43:53.215 --> 43:56.207
I'm sorry if I'm making a pest of myself here.

43:56.343 --> 43:59.085
I would hate to exacerbate
any growing sense

43:59.221 --> 44:02.054
of "Katrina fatigue" in the country at large.

44:02.182 --> 44:05.015
Perhaps you've experienced
this "Katrina fatigue"

44:05.143 --> 44:08.385
if you watch TV
or read your hometown paper.

44:08.522 --> 44:13.562
I mean, it was fun for a while
being outraged at the national response.

44:13.693 --> 44:17.402
And the pictures from the Dome
and the Convention Center were shocking.

44:18.031 --> 44:20.647
Anderson Cooper was here.

44:20.784 --> 44:23.526
Katie Couric too.

44:23.662 --> 44:27.746
But now we're on our own.

44:27.874 --> 44:29.990
And here's the thing.

44:30.126 --> 44:34.415
For a while, I thought we could rely
on our sense of ourselves,

44:34.548 --> 44:38.962
on the fact that we were,
regardless of race, class or color,

44:39.094 --> 44:41.676
New Orleanians first and last.

44:41.805 --> 44:45.764
But there's an election coming, right?

44:45.892 --> 44:48.133
And no way a shared sense of purpose

44:48.270 --> 44:51.228
is gonna survive a New Orleans election.

44:51.356 --> 44:53.472
Right?

44:53.608 --> 44:56.850
Now there are people
openly delighted with the fact

44:56.987 --> 45:01.026
that thousands of exiles,
most of them black, won't be able to vote.

45:01.157 --> 45:05.617
Meanwhile our incumbent mayor,
sensing this,

45:05.745 --> 45:10.159
talks crudely about New Orleans
remaining a "chocolate city."

45:10.292 --> 45:12.999
Meanwhile, a bunch of idiot planners

45:16.214 --> 45:19.251
deciding which neighborhoods
they think ought to go back

45:21.595 --> 45:24.052
And, oh yeah, while no one was looking,

45:24.180 --> 45:27.343
they just laid off every single schoolteacher
in Orleans Parish

45:27.475 --> 45:32.390
because no one's plans apparently
included the public school system.

45:36.943 --> 45:40.310
So, America, if you're feeling guilty

45:40.447 --> 45:42.278
for your Katrina fatigue,

45:42.407 --> 45:45.240
I'm here to put things into perspective.

45:45.368 --> 45:47.404
It's not all about you.

45:47.537 --> 45:49.368
Really.

45:49.497 --> 45:53.115
Because down here in the city of misrule,

45:53.251 --> 45:56.994
we are, always...

45:57.130 --> 45:59.212
our own worst enemy.

46:06.932 --> 46:09.264
(Music playing)

46:10.477 --> 46:13.765
(Singing in French)

46:39.673 --> 46:42.335
He's good. He's better than me.

46:44.094 --> 46:45.459
What?

46:46.763 --> 46:50.005
Well, he's better than you today.
That much is true.

46:50.141 --> 46:52.553
I did the best I could.

46:55.397 --> 46:58.184
Even if I didn't, I can't do that.

47:10.787 --> 47:13.494
(Creighton's voice on computer)

47:18.294 --> 47:20.956
— What's that?
— Dad's new rant.

47:21.089 --> 47:24.547
He put it up last night. Kinda harsh.

47:24.676 --> 47:26.758
Last night?

47:33.393 --> 47:35.384
(Creighton groaning)

47:39.774 --> 47:41.856
Up late?

47:41.985 --> 47:44.601
Ahem!

47:46.114 --> 47:48.605
How'd you do? You get any pages?

47:50.702 --> 47:53.489
Yeah. Yeah, some.

47:54.581 --> 47:57.448
Book coming along?

47:57.584 --> 48:00.041
Yeah. Mmm.

48:05.008 --> 48:07.499
I'm going to Carville.
I'll be back this evening.

48:07.635 --> 48:09.045
Mmm.

48:12.015 --> 48:14.472
J‘ For heaven

48:14.601 --> 48:18.389
J‘ And home

48:19.647 --> 48:24.437
J‘ When Jesus

48:24.569 --> 48:27.311
J‘Is

48:27.447 --> 48:31.531
J‘ My potion

48:31.659 --> 48:36.494
J‘ And a constant

48:36.623 --> 48:39.035
J‘ Friend

48:39.167 --> 48:43.331
J‘Is he

48:43.463 --> 48:44.953
J‘Oh

48:45.090 --> 48:48.127
J‘ His eye

48:48.259 --> 48:51.877
J‘Is on

48:52.013 --> 48:54.470
J‘ The sparrow

48:54.599 --> 48:58.717
J‘ And I know

48:58.853 --> 49:02.721
J‘ He watches

49:02.857 --> 49:06.224
J‘MeJ‘

49:32.137 --> 49:35.379
— All these trucks got bodies?
- Yes, ma'am.

49:35.515 --> 49:38.382
(Toni) Jerome Cherry's body
has been here since September?

49:38.518 --> 49:41.055
No, not here. St. Gabriel and then here.

49:42.355 --> 49:45.518
(Unlocking truck door)

49:47.235 --> 49:49.442
You need to be with me.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.069
I know.

49:53.741 --> 49:55.732
(Refrigeration unit buzzing)

50:24.272 --> 50:25.432
(Unzipping)

50:35.158 --> 50:36.614
OK, OK.

50:36.743 --> 50:38.279
It's OK.

50:43.625 --> 50:47.163
This is David Maurice Brooks.

50:47.295 --> 50:51.584
And you've had him here under
the wrong name for nearly five months.

50:51.716 --> 50:53.877
He was brought from
the Galvez Parish coroner

50:54.010 --> 50:56.422
and this is the name
on the death certificate.

50:56.554 --> 50:59.011
— May I see the death certificate?
- Sure.

51:01.851 --> 51:04.809
"Cause of death — cerebral hemorrhage.

51:04.938 --> 51:07.270
"Manner of death —

51:07.398 --> 51:09.810
"accident.

51:09.943 --> 51:12.434
"Fall from top bunk."

51:19.118 --> 51:21.279
Tell me something.

51:21.412 --> 51:24.449
How is it that a young man
can be sent to a distant parish,

51:24.582 --> 51:26.538
die in custody, be autopsied,

51:26.668 --> 51:30.752
and lay in a morgue for months
without anyone figuring out who he is?

51:36.844 --> 51:38.550
(Crow cawing)

51:46.604 --> 51:48.936
(Refrigeration units buzzing)

52:03.454 --> 52:05.445
(Buzzing intensifies)

52:07.417 --> 52:09.999
I didn't even know it was this bad.

52:11.170 --> 52:12.501
— Hey, boo.
— Hey.

52:12.630 --> 52:15.337
— How you doin'?
- I'm OK.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.718
He wasn't in much pain.

52:17.844 --> 52:19.926
No, doesn't seem so.

52:20.054 --> 52:23.546
Uh, I got something for you, though.
Come on.

52:23.683 --> 52:25.674
(Musicians warming up instruments)

52:31.107 --> 52:33.564
Daddy would want you to have it.

52:33.693 --> 52:38.062
That's the last horn your daddy played.
That's supposed to be in the family.

52:39.032 --> 52:41.193
This your boy?

52:41.326 --> 52:42.611
Lamar.

52:42.744 --> 52:45.110
Maybe you gonna play some horn, huh?

52:45.246 --> 52:47.077
(Antoine) Aww!

52:55.882 --> 52:57.964
You gonna second—line back, right?

52:58.092 --> 53:01.425
Your father would be spinnin'
if I did anything else today.

53:04.140 --> 53:06.802
(I I'll Fly Away)

53:18.780 --> 53:20.486
(Woman) OK.

53:20.615 --> 53:23.448
So, have you specified a funeral home?

53:27.038 --> 53:29.154
(Toni) LaDonna? I know a funeral home that...

53:29.290 --> 53:31.121
I ain't doin' this now.

53:32.251 --> 53:33.536
I know how you feel, but...

53:33.669 --> 53:38.129
Daymo been here five months.
He could be here another few days, right?

53:38.257 --> 53:40.999
Ain't no thing you keep him a little longer.

53:41.135 --> 53:42.716
Ma'am?

53:42.845 --> 53:46.633
I am not bringing this news home
to my family during Carnival.

53:46.766 --> 53:49.678
My mama just got out
the damn emergency room.

53:49.811 --> 53:52.518
The rest of her family coming in
from Baton Rouge to be with her.

53:52.647 --> 53:55.138
No. I'm not doing it.

53:55.274 --> 53:57.526
Come Wednesday, I'll handle all this.

53:57.652 --> 54:00.359
I'll deal with the funeral parlor,
I'll deal with everything I have to deal with.

54:00.488 --> 54:03.275
But right now, no.

54:08.663 --> 54:10.995
(J‘ Band playing)

54:20.216 --> 54:22.958
Uh, that's 12 and 6, 18.

54:25.471 --> 54:26.381
Two shrimp.

54:26.514 --> 54:29.426
Two shrimp. Sarah?

54:29.559 --> 54:31.345
J‘ My real best friend
J‘ My real best friend

54:31.727 --> 54:34.104
J‘ My real best friend
J‘ My real best friend J‘

54:34.230 --> 54:35.970
(Davis) And two is your change. Your name?

54:36.107 --> 54:37.768

54:37.900 --> 54:39.401
Thanks.

54:39.527 --> 54:42.189
Order in. Lamb shanks, gazpacho.

54:42.321 --> 54:44.312
Lamb shank, gazpacho.
That makes three lamb shanks,

54:44.449 --> 54:45.905
two gazpacho all day.

54:46.033 --> 54:47.648
OK, sweetbreads and a bisque.

54:47.785 --> 54:51.528
— Ronda?
— We are caught up.

54:51.664 --> 54:53.871
You are rocking it, my lady.

54:55.042 --> 54:58.170
You're not gonna ditch me
and go sit in with the band, are you?

54:58.296 --> 54:59.502
Not a chance.

55:17.648 --> 55:19.639
(J‘ Music playing over speakers)

56:04.529 --> 56:06.485
Hey, Dominique.

56:06.614 --> 56:09.276
- Any problems?
— Mm—mm. We've had a quiet day.

56:09.408 --> 56:11.399
Well, thanks for staying, honey.

56:11.536 --> 56:15.495
— OK. You OK?
— Yeah. Just tired.

56:15.623 --> 56:17.409
— LaDonna.
— Hey, Ma.

56:17.542 --> 56:19.328
I thought you was in Baton Rouge.

56:19.460 --> 56:22.042

56:22.171 --> 56:23.911
— All right, I'm gonna go.
— Thanks, honey.

56:24.048 --> 56:27.131
— See you later, Miss Brooks.
- All right, dear.

56:42.441 --> 56:44.272
I don't need to be baby—sitted.

56:45.778 --> 56:49.771
Did you talk to the lawyer?
Did they find Daymo?

56:49.907 --> 56:51.693
No, they didn't.

56:51.826 --> 56:54.158
Well, what happens now?

56:56.789 --> 56:59.121
When I find out, I'll let you know, Ma.
