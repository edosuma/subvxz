00:17.930 --> 00:22.210
- Charlie comes in hollering
about a small ugly man

00:22.210 --> 00:25.480
hiding in the cars in the back tree line.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.970
- How ugly was he?

00:26.970 --> 00:28.560
- Did it smell a certain way?

00:28.560 --> 00:32.010
- Charlie said it was the
ugliest man he ever saw,

00:32.010 --> 00:34.283
like fugly-ugly.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.120
- But did he smell something?

00:38.120 --> 00:41.520
- This is a scrap yard,
everything stinks around here.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.220
Wait a minute, let me call him up.

00:44.972 --> 00:46.430
- You have a theory?

00:46.430 --> 00:47.490
- Yep.

00:47.490 --> 00:48.410
You?

00:48.410 --> 00:50.070
- He's on his way.

00:50.070 --> 00:51.960
- So what led you to get in touch

00:51.960 --> 00:54.852
with the Cryptozoological
Investigative Department?

00:54.852 --> 00:55.685
- Huh?

00:55.685 --> 00:56.660
- Crypto Hunters.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.830
- Oh, yeah, right.

00:58.830 --> 01:02.160
We saw some weird stuff on the video feed,

01:02.160 --> 01:04.090
tires flying trough the air,

01:04.090 --> 01:06.693
cars moving with no equipment moving it.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.620
Cops came 'round for like
five minutes then left.

01:11.620 --> 01:12.693
The chicken shits.

01:15.180 --> 01:17.980
It was my son Bobby who told me to call,

01:17.980 --> 01:19.713
found your number from a website.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.780
Charlie.

01:23.780 --> 01:28.113
Tell these guys about that
fugly dude that you saw.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.588
- I was pulling a radiator out a Dodge

01:31.588 --> 01:34.300
and I smelt this weird
burnt chocolate smell.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.430
Then I started looking around the car.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.490
Then all a sudden, I
see this little ugly guy

01:39.490 --> 01:41.010
standing right there in the grass.

01:41.010 --> 01:42.814
Scared the shit out of me.

01:42.814 --> 01:44.720
Then I threw my screw-diver at him

01:44.720 --> 01:47.060
but he was gone real fast.

01:47.060 --> 01:48.290
But I felt bad,

01:48.290 --> 01:50.780
I thought it was some customer's
ugly kid or something.

01:50.780 --> 01:51.680
- But it wasn't?

01:51.680 --> 01:52.513
- No, I asked.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.850
Nobody has a kid out here.

01:53.850 --> 01:56.600
- That's when we started
looking at the video tapes.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.440
Usually we get homeless or thieves.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.470
Dogs, you used to keep most of them away,

02:02.470 --> 02:05.137
but they all disappeared
about six months ago.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.100
- I think we need to
take a look at the Dodge.

02:27.980 --> 02:28.813
I smell it.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.003
Woodwose, Satyr?

02:33.130 --> 02:35.303
- Maybe, let's look for a burrow.

02:40.050 --> 02:42.140
- You go left, I'll go right.

02:45.953 --> 02:46.786
Hobgoblin!

04:01.173 --> 04:03.498
Daddy said you're gonna be in a play.

04:03.498 --> 04:05.410
- Yes, I'm gonna be a sheep

04:05.410 --> 04:09.890
and I mostly just stand around
saying

04:09.890 --> 04:11.370
- Well, that sounds like fun.

04:11.370 --> 04:13.000
Are you excited?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.160
- I guess so.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.870
Mommy, are you gonna be home tonight?

04:16.870 --> 04:19.900
- No, sweetie, Sans and I
have to work this weekend.

04:19.900 --> 04:21.370
But I'll be home Monday.

04:21.370 --> 04:24.260
- Are you gonna shoot anything?

04:24.260 --> 04:25.770
- We don't shoot anything.

04:25.770 --> 04:26.823
We shoot monsters.

04:27.790 --> 04:30.136
- Hi, Bug eyes!
- Hey, Snot face!

04:30.136 --> 04:31.848
- I'm gonna be a sheep!

04:31.848 --> 04:33.463
- I think they make a pill for that.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.370
- Listen, sweetie, we
gotta get back to work.

04:36.370 --> 04:41.318
So, tell daddy I love him
and lots of hugs and kisses.

04:41.318 --> 04:42.483
- Love you, mommy!

04:42.483 --> 04:43.536
Bye, Bug eyes!

04:43.536 --> 04:44.518
- Love you too!

04:49.740 --> 04:51.980
- We heading to the farm now?

04:51.980 --> 04:54.870
- Yeah, I was just
watching this kid's videos.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.690
He's been posting once or twice a week,

04:56.690 --> 04:58.170
mainly about this creepy barn

04:58.170 --> 04:59.970
and what he thinks is lurking there.

05:01.630 --> 05:04.463
He seems really terrified of the place.

05:06.670 --> 05:10.033
But this is the one that
has people all spun-up.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.720
- Last night, we saw these weird orbs

05:13.720 --> 05:14.870
floating near the barn.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.143
- I saw them first.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.160
I was looking out the window

05:19.160 --> 05:21.080
'cause I didn't wanna go to sleep

05:21.080 --> 05:24.040
and I saw a weird light
by the tree by the barn.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.010
- Carrie came and got me
and watched for 10 minutes

05:26.010 --> 05:28.180
as this weird orb moved around the barn.

05:28.180 --> 05:30.369
It was kind of a purple or pink color.

05:30.369 --> 05:32.460
- Definitely purple.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.980
- At first, I thought
it was a lightning bug,

05:33.980 --> 05:35.360
but then I thought that lightning bugs

05:35.360 --> 05:37.060
couldn't get that big, so...

05:38.160 --> 05:39.950
- It was an E.T.

05:39.950 --> 05:40.783
- Maybe.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.320
So, anyway, I thought
that we'd come out here

05:43.320 --> 05:44.980
and check something out and maybe find out

05:44.980 --> 05:46.030
where it came from.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.200
- Did you tell mom?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
- No, I didn't tell mom,

05:48.200 --> 05:50.910
you know how she gets when
she's planning an event.

05:50.910 --> 05:54.230
But I got my BB gun just in
case anything pops out on us.

05:54.230 --> 05:57.501
- Okay, just don't shoot the cat, again.

05:57.501 --> 05:58.501
- All right.

06:08.059 --> 06:10.550
Are we going inside?

06:10.550 --> 06:12.843
Let's go take a
look at the woods first.

06:14.888 --> 06:15.723
What is that?

06:15.723 --> 06:16.820
What?

06:16.820 --> 06:18.370
Look, there's something in there.

06:18.370 --> 06:19.810
I see some kind of shadow.

06:19.810 --> 06:21.000
Are you taking a video?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.118
Yes, I'm recording.

06:33.830 --> 06:36.730
- Werewolf?
- Possibly.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.830
But this far east, I don't know.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.420
- Wendigo?

06:41.420 --> 06:43.170
- The kids would be dead if it was.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.880
- Did they hear a sound?

06:46.840 --> 06:50.183
- Listen, you know it wasn't an A.T.R.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.570
- Close to trees.

06:54.960 --> 06:58.823
- It's a long drive, we need
to hurry up and just get going.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.780
- Hello, you guys must be my weekenders.

07:50.780 --> 07:53.303
- Yes, ma'am, I'm Diego, this is Sans.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.740
Lovely place you have here.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.410
- Thank you, it's a work in progress.

07:58.410 --> 07:59.960
Did you guys find the place okay?

07:59.960 --> 08:01.370
- It's kind of out here in the country,

08:01.370 --> 08:03.920
but you know, our GPS got us here okay.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.407
- GPS is just so the
government can track you.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.023
- Okay.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.770
Well, let me to show to your rooms.

08:25.151 --> 08:29.110
- This place is kinda
creepy and strange, huh?

08:29.110 --> 08:30.290
- Yeah.

08:30.290 --> 08:32.383
Seeing a monster will make you think that.

08:34.160 --> 08:34.993
I gotta piss.

08:49.526 --> 08:51.010
- Welcome, guys.

08:51.010 --> 08:51.990
Just wanna let you guys know

08:51.990 --> 08:54.140
that over there is our dining room

08:54.140 --> 08:56.080
and over here is the lounge area

08:56.080 --> 08:58.600
and I can take you guys
upstairs to show you your rooms.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.050
- Great.
- Follow me.

09:00.050 --> 09:00.883
Great.

09:02.220 --> 09:03.274
That's awesome.

09:03.274 --> 09:04.300
- You guys enjoying the weather?

09:04.300 --> 09:06.631
- Yes, it's beautiful.
- Awesome.

09:06.631 --> 09:07.840
Well, I just wanna let you guys know

09:07.840 --> 09:11.150
that we have a room down here,
we also have a room in here.

09:11.150 --> 09:14.840
There are sheets, blankets and
towels in that whole closet,

09:14.840 --> 09:16.830
water and snacks are in both rooms.

09:16.830 --> 09:19.990
The wifi password is on the
desk if you guys need it.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.000
We're having dinner tonight at six,

09:22.000 --> 09:26.800
my husband is making salad,
meatloaf and rhubarb pie,

09:26.800 --> 09:28.288
he's the one who cooks.

09:28.288 --> 09:29.786
- When can we look at the barn?

09:29.786 --> 09:32.100
- Oh, what my friend is trying to say is,

09:32.100 --> 09:33.410
will you be able to give us a tour

09:33.410 --> 09:34.570
of the rest of the property?

09:34.570 --> 09:35.670
And the barn?

09:36.660 --> 09:39.440
Yeah, I can have my husband
or maybe my son Troy

09:39.440 --> 09:42.010
show you guys the carriage
rooms and the stalls.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.910
I just wanna let you guys
know that not all the rooms

09:43.910 --> 09:45.410
are open to the public.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.610
We're still working some things out.

09:47.610 --> 09:49.110
- Well, that'd be great, thanks.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.550
- Awesome, let me show
you one of the rooms.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.920
You guys are
crypto hunters, right?

10:00.920 --> 10:03.145
Cryptozoological investigators.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.591
Cryptozoological-

10:04.591 --> 10:05.820
We're crypto hunters.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.060
We investigate.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.460
And if on a rare occasion,

10:08.460 --> 10:11.950
we come across something of the
crypto type, we take action.

10:11.950 --> 10:14.923
You sent us a message
and we saw the video,

10:15.800 --> 10:17.510
so we thought we'd come check it out.

10:17.510 --> 10:20.400
Look, my parents aren't
happy we posted that video.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.630
Some weirdos, some of
them would just show up

10:22.630 --> 10:23.960
and some would call ahead to see

10:23.960 --> 10:25.480
if they could go ghost hunting.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.360
Some dude even showed
up with a Geiger counter

10:27.360 --> 10:28.330
and a respirator.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.190
Dad called the cops on that guy.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.390
- Reverend Ben?

10:31.390 --> 10:32.223
- Probably.

10:32.223 --> 10:34.280
- I'm sorry, Reverend who?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.490
- He's a different type of investigator.

10:36.490 --> 10:39.053
He thinks all cryptos come from Chernobyl.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.530
- So where did you see it?

10:44.510 --> 10:46.460
- Around the back part of the building.

10:47.470 --> 10:48.380
- Let's go take a look.

10:48.380 --> 10:51.720
- I wouldn't, there's
renovation and you know,

10:51.720 --> 10:53.580
it's very raggedy-
- It's all right, kid.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.390
Look, we're just gonna
go look around outside.

10:55.390 --> 10:57.190
Your mom told us about all the work.

11:05.660 --> 11:07.620
I'm curious to see the layout.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.033
- Curiosity skinned the cat.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.070
- I don't think that's
how the saying goes.

11:13.180 --> 11:14.603
- Well, then how'd the cat die?

11:20.709 --> 11:24.000
Hey, what's going on?

11:24.000 --> 11:27.057
- They went behind the
barn to go check it out.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.190
- Hi, I'm Linda.

11:58.190 --> 12:01.630
Are you guys looking to
host an event or a wedding?

12:01.630 --> 12:05.960
- Hi, I'm Jannet, and this is Gord.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.470
He's performing this weekend in town

12:07.470 --> 12:10.620
and thought we would check this place out.

12:10.620 --> 12:12.220
- Hello.

12:12.220 --> 12:13.720
- This is my husband, Greg,

12:13.720 --> 12:16.360
and those are kids, Troy and Carrie.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.060
- It's even better than the video.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.830
- The video my son posted?

12:20.830 --> 12:23.640
- Yeah, my drummer Brian
mentioned this place was nearby.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.313
We'd seen the video a bunch of times, man.

12:25.313 --> 12:26.883
I had to see where it happened.

12:29.670 --> 12:32.037
- Troy, you got another fan of your video.

12:32.037 --> 12:35.120
TroJam, awesome video, dude!

12:35.120 --> 12:36.630
- Oh my God, GBM.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.360
Gord from GBM.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.400
- You know my music?

12:39.400 --> 12:40.910
- Yeah.
- Cool.

12:40.910 --> 12:43.360
- You took me to the
concert last year, remember?

12:45.287 --> 12:46.403
- I think so.

12:46.403 --> 12:49.100
- You, I love that scream.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.190
Loud enough to wake demons.

12:51.190 --> 12:54.360
Should be in movies or
heavy metal music, huh?

12:55.270 --> 12:56.730
I'd like to bring some folks out here

12:56.730 --> 12:58.360
and do a little jam session.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.850
Nothing big, maybe six or seven people.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.130
- Sure, what dates were you looking at?

13:03.130 --> 13:04.769
- Monday till maybe Thursday.

13:04.769 --> 13:05.602
- Oh.

13:06.830 --> 13:08.200
- Yeah, why not?

13:08.200 --> 13:09.580
We got people checking out Sunday,

13:09.580 --> 13:11.210
so we should be able to
get the place cleaned up

13:11.210 --> 13:14.140
and have it ready for
you guys come Monday.

13:14.140 --> 13:15.790
- This place will work just fine.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.420
- Okay, I'll start getting
everything in place.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.270
- Cool, cool.

13:20.270 --> 13:23.000
Jannet will get my manager to contact you.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.900
- Okay, have your manager call or email me

13:25.900 --> 13:27.880
and we'll work out all the details.

13:27.880 --> 13:28.713
- Definitely.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.980
- That was interesting.

13:42.980 --> 13:44.853
- Is this gonna be the new normal for us?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.773
I think that's
the door from the video.

13:55.650 --> 13:57.040
- Wood's pretty close.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.143
- Not far at all.

13:59.650 --> 14:01.980
- Be real easy for
something to get in there.

14:01.980 --> 14:03.433
- Barely an inconvenience.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.820
But I don't wanna get into
anything too heavy yet.

14:07.820 --> 14:09.720
Let's go make friendly with the hosts.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.293
Hi, there.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.403
You must be Carrie?

14:23.300 --> 14:24.317
- That's my name.

14:24.317 --> 14:25.250
Who are you?

14:25.250 --> 14:28.706
- These are the crypto
hunters I told you about.

14:28.706 --> 14:30.020
Did you guys find anything?

14:30.020 --> 14:32.010
- No, but we'll look again later.

14:32.010 --> 14:34.740
It's dinner time and we
should get settled in.

14:34.740 --> 14:35.980
Don't worry, kid.

14:35.980 --> 14:37.520
We'll figure it out.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.930
So your dad cooks, huh?

14:38.930 --> 14:39.890
Is he any good?

14:39.890 --> 14:41.860
- Yeah, he was a cook on a submarine.

14:41.860 --> 14:43.840
- Woo, hot damn!

14:43.840 --> 14:45.540
Those are the best cooks out there.

14:45.540 --> 14:46.790
- Yeah, he's pretty good.

14:55.785 --> 14:57.327
- Are you too married?

14:57.327 --> 14:59.327
- No, are you proposing?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.338
Got you, kid.

15:03.338 --> 15:04.540
What'd I miss?

15:04.540 --> 15:07.073
- Your daughter just got burned. Oh no.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.330
- Oh, no, are you serious?

15:08.330 --> 15:09.630
- So I missed it.

15:09.630 --> 15:10.570
Well, at least I got some pie

15:10.570 --> 15:12.370
in case anybody still got some room.

15:13.490 --> 15:15.332
So what do you guys do?

15:15.332 --> 15:16.165
- Monster hunting-

15:16.165 --> 15:19.114
- We're cryptozoological investigators.

15:19.114 --> 15:20.830
- You hear about Troy's video?

15:20.830 --> 15:22.350
- That's correct.

15:22.350 --> 15:25.130
We're here to investigate the sightings.

15:25.130 --> 15:26.053
- Investigate?

15:27.570 --> 15:29.710
Just who are you people?

15:29.710 --> 15:33.220
- Cryptozoological specialists.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.630
Sometimes we're sent in to
work with law enforcement,

15:35.630 --> 15:39.710
the military, search and
rescue and others, you know,

15:39.710 --> 15:41.993
to investigate when
something weird pops up.

15:42.950 --> 15:44.413
- So you're like police?

15:44.413 --> 15:47.200
- We have monsters, not criminals.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.610
- We have some authority,

15:48.610 --> 15:53.610
but we're more like a contractor
or private investigator.

15:54.570 --> 15:56.380
- So you said you were usually sent in

15:56.380 --> 15:58.453
by the military and police.

15:59.550 --> 16:00.900
Why are you here?

16:00.900 --> 16:04.090
Did the sheriff or local
police contact you?

16:04.090 --> 16:05.323
I contacted them.

16:06.220 --> 16:08.370
I wanted them to look
at the shadow figure.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.960
- Okay, look, I have been
all over the property

16:14.960 --> 16:19.580
and I have not found anything
that looks like the thing

16:19.580 --> 16:21.600
that was in the video.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.763
I'm not certain what you can do to help.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.240
- Look, I get it.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.110
We show up telling you
we wanna find a creature

16:30.110 --> 16:31.460
that was seen in the video,

16:32.450 --> 16:35.140
but this video sort of went viral

16:36.040 --> 16:38.780
and suddenly you've
got weirdos showing up.

16:38.780 --> 16:39.773
- Like Gord?

16:40.800 --> 16:41.870
- Gord?

16:41.870 --> 16:42.970
- Yeah, Gord from GBM.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.330
He dropped by when you guys
were looking at the barn.

16:46.330 --> 16:47.903
- Wait, you two know him?

16:49.880 --> 16:52.080
- We've looked into him in the past.

16:52.080 --> 16:56.330
He's presented with some signs
that put him on our radar.

16:56.330 --> 16:57.690
- How so?

16:57.690 --> 16:58.930
- He's a druid.

16:58.930 --> 17:02.120
- He's from central Europe
where some old religions

17:02.120 --> 17:04.310
are still practiced.

17:04.310 --> 17:06.620
He rented the barn for a few days.

17:06.620 --> 17:07.863
Should I cancel?

17:08.780 --> 17:10.190
- You do what's right for your business,

17:10.190 --> 17:11.713
but I'd be cautious.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.393
- Troy.

17:24.850 --> 17:25.840
Why did you call these guys?

17:25.840 --> 17:27.173
- I messed everything up.

17:32.060 --> 17:33.544
- What do you mean?

17:33.544 --> 17:35.010
- I mean, I was just trying to show

17:35.010 --> 17:38.210
what was going on at the
barn< nobody believed me.

17:38.210 --> 17:40.320
And then people started
to bother you and mom

17:40.320 --> 17:42.130
and I just wanted to fix it.

17:42.130 --> 17:44.785
- It's not that we don't believe you.

17:44.785 --> 17:46.685
We're just not seeing the same things.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.160
- All right, what do we
know about these guys?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.210
Where'd you find them?

18:02.210 --> 18:05.143
- The Crypto Hunters are
legends on SpookTube.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.650
They're like the Men in
Black, but with monsters.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.503
- Okay, well, at least they were invited.

18:18.300 --> 18:23.300
And they seem more normal than
some of the others lately.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.110
Maybe they can convince
you there's no monsters

18:26.110 --> 18:27.360
creeping around the barn.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.203
Okay, so what do you need from us?

18:41.310 --> 18:44.773
- We'd like to look at the
barn, check out the woods.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.024
- Probably a wendigo.

18:47.857 --> 18:51.143
- Sans, don't jump to conclusions.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.370
We'd just like to check it out
and see if there is anything.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.730
If there's not, you know,

18:58.730 --> 19:00.630
we'll send it out to the Crypto Community

19:00.630 --> 19:03.040
and people probably just stop bugging you.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.890
- And what if it's real?

19:04.890 --> 19:05.933
- Then it gets real.

19:07.070 --> 19:08.720
- Sans.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.160
What Sans is not saying very well...

19:12.140 --> 19:13.290
We'll talk later, Sans.

19:15.600 --> 19:20.150
Is that we have various
methods of dealing with things.

19:20.150 --> 19:21.893
Whether it's natural or crypto.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.673
- Apple.

19:25.910 --> 19:30.910
- I meant to ask, is it okay
if we invite another expert?

19:33.570 --> 19:35.410
- What kind of expert?

19:35.410 --> 19:39.943
- Well, she specializes
in paranormal things.

19:40.900 --> 19:41.870
- She sees ghosts.

19:41.870 --> 19:45.430
- Mrs. Apple is a spiritual counselor.

19:45.430 --> 19:48.120
She can tell us if there's
something paranormal

19:48.120 --> 19:50.433
that we need to look into.

19:53.570 --> 19:54.403
- Okay.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.220
You can bring Mrs. Apple by.

19:57.220 --> 19:58.460
I'll show you guys around tomorrow,

19:58.460 --> 20:02.670
but I'm not sure you're
gonna find your Winabago

20:03.940 --> 20:06.824
or Winaprego, whatever it was you said.

20:06.824 --> 20:08.112
- Wendigo.

20:08.112 --> 20:10.124
- What's a wendigo?

20:10.124 --> 20:12.270
- They're kind of like
golems but with antlers.

20:12.270 --> 20:14.010
- You mean like that little gray guy

20:14.010 --> 20:16.130
that stole the ring from Bilbo?

20:16.130 --> 20:19.520
- No, Bilbo stole the ring from Gollum,

20:19.520 --> 20:23.000
so then Gollum stole it back from Frodo.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.960
But I don't think that's the same thing,

20:24.960 --> 20:27.754
I think he was a deformed
hobbit or something.

20:27.754 --> 20:29.620
- Golems are made out of clay.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.210
- Created by the Jews.

20:31.210 --> 20:33.050
- How do you know if it's Jewish?

20:33.050 --> 20:34.230
- Well, you have to look and see if it's -

20:34.230 --> 20:35.230
- Sans!

20:35.230 --> 20:36.230
Don't say it.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.223
- Circumcised?

20:39.128 --> 20:39.961
Sans.

20:39.961 --> 20:42.597
- Are you sure you two aren't married?

20:57.645 --> 21:00.145
- Do you think it's out there?

21:05.860 --> 21:09.520
Look, maybe once this is over,
we can take a few weeks off.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.963
I can spend time with the
family and you can go searching.

21:18.003 --> 21:20.040
But let's figure out what's going on.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.590
This family might be in danger.

21:29.230 --> 21:31.530
- I'll set up some trail
cameras, hunker down.

21:35.770 --> 21:37.423
No shooting tonight, I promise.

21:46.730 --> 21:47.850
- The previous owners moved to Florida,

21:47.850 --> 21:50.440
the place sat abandoned
for about 50 years.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.490
Linda's dad bought it
when she was about 10

21:51.490 --> 21:53.190
and then we had the bright idea

21:53.190 --> 21:56.930
to turn it into a luxury
B&B and event venue.

21:56.930 --> 21:57.780
- Hmm, interesting.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.010
So how long before you hold events?

22:00.010 --> 22:01.210
- Oh, we already do.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.130
We got a couple of rooms
for the bridal party

22:03.130 --> 22:03.963
and then above the barn,

22:03.963 --> 22:05.050
we got the carriage room cleaned up,

22:05.050 --> 22:06.740
set up a couple of bathrooms,

22:06.740 --> 22:08.450
although we'll still bring
in portable bathrooms

22:08.450 --> 22:09.640
when we have a lot of guests.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.000
- Portable bathrooms?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.310
- Yeah, it's basically a fancy trailer.

22:13.310 --> 22:16.180
They got a couple changing
rooms, two full sized bathrooms.

22:16.180 --> 22:19.440
They come in, guests do their
business, it drives away.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.932
- Less clean up for you.

22:21.765 --> 22:23.408
- Yeah, no, they literally
drive the shit away.

22:24.241 --> 22:25.820
- Drive this shit away.

22:25.820 --> 22:27.320
That ought to be their slogan.

22:28.927 --> 22:29.760
Car door closes

22:30.893 --> 22:31.726
- I think that's Mrs.
Apple.

22:42.050 --> 22:43.330
- What are you doing?

22:43.330 --> 22:44.850
- Looking at her eyes.

22:44.850 --> 22:47.080
- Well, I can see that, but why?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.890
- Mr. Sans says she can see ghosts,

22:48.890 --> 22:51.733
so I figured that'd be
something weird with her eyes.

22:52.610 --> 22:55.290
- And do you see anything weird?

22:55.290 --> 22:56.173
- Not really.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.880
- You're an interesting little girl.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.240
How old are you?

23:00.240 --> 23:01.210
- 10, how old are you?

23:01.210 --> 23:02.455
Carrie!

23:02.455 --> 23:03.823
- Ha, you blinked!

23:07.010 --> 23:09.800
Diego tells me you have
a very interesting barn.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.400
I understand some of it's
typically off limits,

23:13.400 --> 23:15.020
but could I take a look?

23:15.020 --> 23:18.040
- Well, the second floor
is still being renovated

23:18.040 --> 23:21.140
and really hasn't been organized,

23:21.140 --> 23:22.820
but I guess as long as we're careful,

23:22.820 --> 23:24.750
I could walk you around.

23:24.750 --> 23:25.640
- Can I come too?

23:25.640 --> 23:28.410
I like to see all the ghosts.

23:28.410 --> 23:30.930
- I doubt you're gonna
see any ghost, but okay.

23:30.930 --> 23:32.000
- Fantastic.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.133
I'll grab my crystals.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.650
- All right, I guess I'll
take Mr. Sans and Ms. Diego

23:37.650 --> 23:40.316
and show 'em around some of
the back rooms and the stalls.

23:40.316 --> 23:43.084
- I'd like to go with you, dad.

23:43.084 --> 23:43.917
- You sure?

23:44.801 --> 23:45.634
Okay.

23:51.922 --> 23:53.458
- This way.

24:36.696 --> 24:39.230
- So just about everything you
see is original to the lodge.

24:39.230 --> 24:40.990
The holding pens,

24:40.990 --> 24:43.797
these milk stalls haven't
been used since the 1920s.

24:47.187 --> 24:50.473
- Looks like a good place
for a Nosferatu or a Dracula.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.900
- They're called vampires.

24:53.770 --> 24:56.540
- Well, I don't speak Romanian, so...

24:56.540 --> 24:59.410
- Where do you think the
word Nosferatu comes from?

24:59.410 --> 25:00.243
- Books.

25:04.115 --> 25:04.948
Cobra pig!

25:07.330 --> 25:09.141
- Did someone just scream
something about a pig?

25:11.245 --> 25:12.078
- Hunters.

25:12.917 --> 25:14.580
- You guys have guns?

25:14.580 --> 25:16.280
- Of course, you don't?

25:16.280 --> 25:18.410
- It's okay, false alarm.

25:18.410 --> 25:21.010
- You said it was cobra something.

25:21.010 --> 25:22.170
What was it?

25:22.170 --> 25:23.003
- A cat.

25:23.003 --> 25:24.910
- You were gonna shoot Carrie's cat?

25:24.910 --> 25:27.010
- We don't shoot cats, we're not monsters.

25:36.596 --> 25:40.032
- So, is that normal
to just pull your guns

25:40.032 --> 25:41.427
on something like that?

25:41.427 --> 25:44.460
- I know it can seem sudden and extreme.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.160
I know I was shocked the
first time my trainer did it

25:46.160 --> 25:47.233
on my first mission.

25:48.430 --> 25:50.820
But we're trained to be
in a process of offense,

25:50.820 --> 25:54.083
so even as we identify, classify
and categorize the threat,

25:55.690 --> 25:58.400
if it's harmless, we adjust.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.433
If it's not, we also adjust.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.443
- Aim, identify, shoot, or not.

26:08.688 --> 26:10.550
- Are there any accidents?

26:10.550 --> 26:13.093
- We're here to help
monsters, not hurt people.

26:14.688 --> 26:15.521
Can we look now?

26:20.788 --> 26:24.879
- It would be a weird place
for something to hang out.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.750
- Some creatures like
small places like this.

26:33.060 --> 26:35.253
- You guys really believe
in monsters and stuff?

26:36.750 --> 26:37.820
- We're just here to figure out

26:37.820 --> 26:39.720
if there's something dangerous around.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.473
- We should go look in the woods.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.370
- You two should hang back here.

26:56.370 --> 26:57.293
- I wanna go.

26:59.220 --> 27:00.506
- Okay.

27:00.506 --> 27:01.339
Are you sure?

27:04.070 --> 27:06.380
All alright, let me just grab my rifle.

27:06.380 --> 27:07.613
- Okay, we'll wait.

27:17.730 --> 27:18.563
- Interesting.

27:27.893 --> 27:30.583
How do you feel about this place, Linda?

27:32.790 --> 27:34.330
- I love it here.

27:34.330 --> 27:36.463
It's peaceful and quiet.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.673
I remember playing here as a kid.

27:40.900 --> 27:44.983
Sometimes we would spend
the whole summer out here.

27:45.980 --> 27:50.573
It was creepy at first, but
nothing ever felt scary,

27:52.200 --> 27:55.243
just old, forgotten.

27:56.730 --> 27:58.810
My parents really wanted to do something

27:58.810 --> 28:03.090
grand with this place, restore
it to its former glory,

28:03.090 --> 28:05.023
make it into a museum, something.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.710
Then when they retired,

28:07.710 --> 28:11.353
I tried to think of
something to do with it.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.363
It's kind of our family legacy.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.880
Then Greg and I saw other places
like hunt clubs and farms,

28:21.880 --> 28:23.400
and they were hosting weddings.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.793
And I thought, why not our place?

28:31.470 --> 28:34.510
Hopefully, Troy and Carrie

28:34.510 --> 28:37.460
can make this place bigger, grander.

28:37.460 --> 28:39.350
- We can do a reality show.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.673
I can be the star, Troy can help film it,

28:41.673 --> 28:44.063
and you and daddy can be in the show too.

28:45.710 --> 28:48.350
- Thank you for letting me on
your show, you little diva.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.550
Mrs. Apple, can I ask you a question?

28:52.550 --> 28:54.470
Ms. Diego and Sans?

28:54.470 --> 28:55.540
- Sure, sweetie.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.880
I know all the questions
and answers about those two.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.490
- Are they married?

28:59.490 --> 29:02.843
- Well, yes and no.

29:04.070 --> 29:05.400
But you were saying, Linda?

29:05.400 --> 29:07.840
- Why monsters?

29:07.840 --> 29:12.090
Why look for and hunt monsters?

29:12.090 --> 29:15.830
- Well, we're all drawn
to a type of career,

29:15.830 --> 29:19.670
just sometimes not the
one that you expected.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.770
Same with paranormal and cryptological.

29:22.770 --> 29:25.050
Sometimes you don't know
what path you're gonna take

29:25.050 --> 29:26.260
until you take it.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.810
- Are there really monsters?

29:28.810 --> 29:30.220
- Yes, there really are.

29:30.220 --> 29:33.080
But most people never really meet any.

29:33.080 --> 29:36.490
- I don't know, sounds like
a bunch of fairytales to me.

29:36.490 --> 29:39.450
- Why would anybody wanna see monsters?

29:39.450 --> 29:44.450
- People want to see monsters,
ones with big teeth and horns

29:45.970 --> 29:49.293
because you can easily
recognize them as monsters.

29:50.410 --> 29:53.620
Meanwhile, most of the real
monsters that roam this earth

29:53.620 --> 29:56.493
go around disguised as regular people.

29:57.610 --> 29:59.443
- You're weird, Mrs. Apple.

30:06.210 --> 30:07.133
- Yeah, hello.

30:08.010 --> 30:10.260
I have a couple of guests
staying at my bed and breakfast,

30:10.260 --> 30:11.950
say they're associated
with the police department.

30:11.950 --> 30:14.363
I was wondering if you guys
could verify that for me?

30:15.260 --> 30:16.574
Yeah, I'll hold.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.290
Detective
Corkland, what's your status?

30:21.290 --> 30:23.113
- 1064 at Gates Plaza.

30:24.302 --> 30:26.570
I have a civilian
call routing to your phone.

30:26.570 --> 30:27.403
- Roger that.

30:32.477 --> 30:34.030
Detective Corkland.

30:34.030 --> 30:36.100
- Yeah, hello, sir, my
name is Greg Morgan.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.060
I have a couple of guests
staying at my bed and breakfast,

30:38.060 --> 30:41.000
woman named Diego, guy named Sans,

30:41.000 --> 30:42.710
call themselves Crypto Hunters,

30:42.710 --> 30:44.600
say they're associated with
your police department.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.080
You know who I'm talking about?

30:46.080 --> 30:47.640
- Crypto Hunters.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.610
Yes, we know them.

30:49.610 --> 30:52.170
Are they looking for something?

30:52.170 --> 30:55.000
- Yeah, my son recorded a
video of a little while back

30:55.000 --> 30:56.920
of a weird shadow, he thinks
it's a monster or something,

30:56.920 --> 30:58.860
so I guess he gave these guys a call.

30:58.860 --> 31:00.723
Thing is, they have guns.

31:01.620 --> 31:02.800
Are these guys okay?

31:02.800 --> 31:04.810
- The Crypto Hunters has
helped us out a few times

31:04.810 --> 31:06.810
in the past with some troublesome cases.

31:07.860 --> 31:10.290
They're okay, but it's up to you

31:10.290 --> 31:13.340
whether you wanna give them
access or let them look around.

31:13.340 --> 31:14.173
- All right.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.830
Yeah, I just wanna make
sure they were legitimate.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.200
- Where did you say you were?

31:17.200 --> 31:19.649
- Harbor Cove out on Fairfield Lane.

31:29.651 --> 31:31.830
- Myles, what are you doing?

31:31.830 --> 31:33.251
- It's Jaws.

31:33.251 --> 31:34.251
- It's Jaws?

32:28.040 --> 32:28.910
- Stay here!

32:28.910 --> 32:29.910
Have your gun ready.

32:34.675 --> 32:35.508
Taurus!

32:36.800 --> 32:38.403
- Greg, Troy, to your right!

32:47.009 --> 32:47.842
- I think it's a bear!

32:47.842 --> 32:49.610
- It had horns.

33:00.780 --> 33:02.440
I saw horns.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.407
What was it?

33:04.280 --> 33:07.080
- We think it was a Taurus,
sometimes called a Minotaur.

33:07.980 --> 33:09.230
- Dad said it was a bear.

33:10.490 --> 33:11.910
- People see what they expect to see,

33:11.910 --> 33:14.970
until something convinces them otherwise.

33:14.970 --> 33:16.600
Your dad's a good guy.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.920
He stood firm and took the shot.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.620
- I was too scared to do anything.

33:22.046 --> 33:25.938
- It's okay to be scared,
but you didn't run.

33:25.938 --> 33:26.988
That means something.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.146
- Were you shooting at something?

33:42.146 --> 33:43.646
- Minotaur.
- Bear.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.470
- We were able to scare the creature away.

33:47.470 --> 33:48.310
It seemed pretty frightened,

33:48.310 --> 33:50.324
so I don't think it would be back soon.

33:50.324 --> 33:51.157
- I'll call the local warden

33:51.157 --> 33:52.166
and let him know to be on the look out.

33:52.166 --> 33:54.353
Hopefully it won't come so
close to the house again.

33:54.353 --> 33:56.953
- You think it was a bear
that Troy caught on video?

33:57.880 --> 33:59.760
Do you think it was a bear?

33:59.760 --> 34:00.750
- Maybe.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.600
You know, whatever it was, it's gone.

34:03.550 --> 34:05.930
- Daddy, Mrs. Apple wants to have a seance

34:05.930 --> 34:07.063
in the barn tonight.

34:08.290 --> 34:09.123
- Really?

34:10.080 --> 34:11.630
- I don't know about a seance,

34:11.630 --> 34:13.930
she said something
about energies at night.

34:13.930 --> 34:15.500
- Daddy, please?

34:15.500 --> 34:17.733
It'll be so creepy.

34:20.230 --> 34:21.790
- Okay.

34:21.790 --> 34:23.290
- I guess I'll go make snacks.

34:24.990 --> 34:25.823
- You up for it?

34:26.770 --> 34:28.410
- Yeah, I think I am.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.650
- So, Greg borrows some friend's car

34:38.650 --> 34:41.630
and drives 16 hours to Jacksonville.

34:41.630 --> 34:44.603
Shows up tired, but he's in a crisp tux.

34:45.470 --> 34:47.070
- Well, I mean, I did drive
the entire way in my underwear

34:47.070 --> 34:48.164
so it wouldn't get wrinkled.

34:50.010 --> 34:53.010
One time, I even forgot and got
up and pumped gas like that.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.540
- My dad was so impressed,

34:55.540 --> 34:57.500
he only lectured him for about 10 minutes

34:57.500 --> 34:59.350
before letting us leave for the prom.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.660
- So where did Mr. Sans

35:01.660 --> 35:03.773
take you on your first date, Ms. Diego?

35:04.886 --> 35:07.370
- There's something you
should know about Sans;

35:07.370 --> 35:10.118
he's too cheap to take me any place nice.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.020
But I can tell you why we work together,

35:14.020 --> 35:15.313
why we do what we do.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.740
Do you wanna hear that story?

35:17.740 --> 35:19.260
Sure.

35:19.260 --> 35:20.560
- It's kinda scary though.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.620
You know, sometimes this
world can be a bright,

35:23.620 --> 35:25.183
happy, wonderful place,

35:27.100 --> 35:31.423
but other times it could
be dark, frightening.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.630
There are creatures in this world

35:34.630 --> 35:36.823
that are dark and frightening.

35:39.660 --> 35:41.897
And I ran into one about 20 years ago.

35:45.902 --> 35:48.053
Guess what my job was then.

35:48.053 --> 35:49.685
What?

35:49.685 --> 35:51.003
- I was a police officer.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.103
I was so proud to be one too.

35:56.330 --> 35:58.860
I protected and helped people.

35:58.860 --> 36:00.083
I was happy to do it.

36:02.250 --> 36:05.453
One night, I was with my
partner and we got a call.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.610
We went to a house where a
man and a woman were fighting.

36:09.610 --> 36:10.910
You know, we were sent to make sure

36:10.910 --> 36:12.933
that no one hurt each other.

36:15.870 --> 36:19.590
When we arrived, we found the
man sitting in his living room

36:20.580 --> 36:23.830
with blood on his face and clothes.

36:23.830 --> 36:25.623
It was just blood everywhere.

36:28.300 --> 36:31.363
He sat in the corner, just
rocking back and forth.

36:32.470 --> 36:33.520
He didn't say a word.

36:35.930 --> 36:38.970
He actually didn't say a word
for a month after that night,

36:38.970 --> 36:40.970
not even to tell us about the claw marks

36:40.970 --> 36:43.223
on his face and arms.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.493
The woman was gone.

36:51.020 --> 36:54.010
My partner and I noticed
that the back door

36:54.010 --> 36:55.903
was broken and open.

36:57.390 --> 36:59.311
I told him to stay with the man

36:59.311 --> 37:01.011
and I was gonna go check out back.

37:03.410 --> 37:06.050
The plan was to just go
check out the backyard

37:06.050 --> 37:07.463
until more officers arrived.

37:10.712 --> 37:12.213
Out back, there were trees,

37:15.097 --> 37:20.097
and as I was looking around,
I heard a noise in the trees.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.510
It was like nothing I
had ever heard before.

37:28.950 --> 37:33.333
First, I thought it was an
animal, but it sounded different.

37:36.829 --> 37:41.310
Then I thought maybe it was
the woman in pain nearby.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.023
I was really, really scared.

37:51.160 --> 37:54.423
But I went into the woods
to see what was happening,

37:56.202 --> 37:59.923
it was very, very dark and
all I had was my flashlight.

38:01.343 --> 38:03.233
But I didn't wanna give up on the woman.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.338
And then...

38:08.338 --> 38:09.171
Bam!

38:09.171 --> 38:11.420
Some thing came out of
nowhere and it knocked me down

38:11.420 --> 38:14.923
and it was heavy and
furry and it was so fast.

38:16.510 --> 38:19.160
When I looked around, it
was just all dark around me.

38:20.091 --> 38:22.641
So I got up and I just
stood there for a long time.

38:24.610 --> 38:27.383
Then I thought I could
hear breathing behind me.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.120
I turned around as fast as I could

38:31.120 --> 38:34.760
and there were two bright
orange eyes staring at me

38:34.760 --> 38:36.420
just few feet away.

38:36.420 --> 38:41.420
So I reached for my sidearm,
but it was just gone.

38:47.570 --> 38:48.853
Do you know what it was?

38:50.960 --> 38:51.793
I don't either.

38:54.660 --> 38:59.660
But I know it wasn't a raccoon
or a bear or a dog or a wolf.

39:04.746 --> 39:07.037
- That wasn't scary at all.

39:07.990 --> 39:09.193
- It was a little scary.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.200
- You don't scare easily?

39:12.200 --> 39:15.417
- I get scared, but that wasn't scary.

39:15.417 --> 39:17.420
- Was the thing in the video scary?

39:17.420 --> 39:20.969
- Kind of, but mostly 'cause
it's hard to tell what it is.

39:20.969 --> 39:22.140
- You're not scared here now?

39:22.140 --> 39:24.200
- Nope, I got everybody here.

39:24.200 --> 39:28.653
Mom, dad, Troy, they
wouldn't let anything get me.

39:29.510 --> 39:32.590
- So that still doesn't
explain how you met Mr. Sans.

39:32.590 --> 39:34.763
- You're right, it didn't end there.

39:36.100 --> 39:38.010
You see, I never told
to do one at the station

39:38.010 --> 39:40.313
what I saw that night,
not even my partner.

39:41.320 --> 39:46.020
I was afraid that I would
get a psych eval or fired.

39:46.020 --> 39:47.193
So I stayed silent.

39:49.210 --> 39:50.480
About a week later,

39:50.480 --> 39:53.663
Mrs. Apple and a man named
Collins came to visit.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.370
They knew I saw something

39:58.460 --> 40:00.993
and they were impressed that I survived.

40:02.730 --> 40:04.483
So they offered me a new job.

40:05.324 --> 40:06.320
And a few months later,

40:06.320 --> 40:10.563
I met Sans and we have
worked together ever since.

40:14.828 --> 40:15.745
- Well, it's getting late.

40:15.745 --> 40:18.253
I think I'm gonna get
the kids up to the house.

40:20.040 --> 40:22.070
- Do you think I could have
Troy help me with my gear

40:22.070 --> 40:23.170
before he goes?

40:23.170 --> 40:26.410
I hear he's very good with cameras.

40:26.410 --> 40:27.440
- Will you be okay?

40:27.440 --> 40:29.633
- Yeah, mom, I'd like to help.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.400
- Will you be staying?

40:32.400 --> 40:34.300
- No, I'll be heading
home in a little while.

40:34.300 --> 40:35.520
- Okay, well, before you leave,

40:35.520 --> 40:37.420
stop by the house and
let's have a cup of tea.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.923
Carrie, say good night to Mrs. Apple.

40:39.923 --> 40:43.020
- Bye, Mrs. Apple.
- Bye, sweetie.

40:43.020 --> 40:46.068
- Find me on Facebook, I wanna
learn how you talk to ghosts.

40:46.068 --> 40:47.151
- You got it.

40:52.303 --> 40:54.670
- I didn't get to see anything creepy.

40:54.670 --> 40:57.213
- Maybe you'll get to see
something creepy tomorrow.

40:59.740 --> 41:02.920
- I'm gonna need some space
to spread out my things.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.320
- Yeah, sure, there's a room
down the hall with a table

41:05.320 --> 41:06.570
that should work for you.

41:07.455 --> 41:08.883
Troy, would you mind helping her out?

41:11.690 --> 41:13.740
- Call us if you need us.

41:13.740 --> 41:16.753
- You're just itching to
shoot something, huh, Sans?

41:25.640 --> 41:28.160
- I hate seeing him so scared like this.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.460
It was never like him to
be afraid of everything.

41:30.460 --> 41:31.643
- When did he change?

41:33.015 --> 41:34.730
- When got here about a year ago.

41:34.730 --> 41:36.210
- Anything weird happen?

41:36.210 --> 41:38.310
Did he get lost or hurt?

41:38.310 --> 41:39.560
- No, nothing like that.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.190
He did get really sick though.

41:41.190 --> 41:42.290
- How sick?

41:42.290 --> 41:43.270
- Oh my gosh.

41:43.270 --> 41:46.110
He had a fever, he was
throwing up every day.

41:46.110 --> 41:47.830
Took him to the doctor,
they said it was a virus.

41:47.830 --> 41:50.960
So aspirin and lots of
fluids, that type of thing.

41:50.960 --> 41:55.960
But gosh, Linda and I,
we were really worried.

42:03.659 --> 42:06.760
- Wow, this is place is beautiful.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.900
It must've been gorgeous back in the day.

42:09.900 --> 42:10.950
- Well, I mean, it's cool.

42:10.950 --> 42:13.650
You know, some people wanna
come here and go on vacations

42:13.650 --> 42:14.900
or even get married here.

42:18.297 --> 42:19.130
- And...

42:20.164 --> 42:23.100
- What's the bug spray for?

42:23.100 --> 42:24.050
- Bugs.

42:24.050 --> 42:27.170
- Oh, I thought it was
some sort of ghost thing.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.680
- Nope, just bugs.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.240
No spray is gonna do anything to a ghost.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.670
Here, check this out,

42:32.670 --> 42:34.773
see how the battery and memory card looks.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.680
It's just a regular camera.

42:38.680 --> 42:41.140
The night mode will
pick stuff up sometimes,

42:41.140 --> 42:44.053
but mostly it just helps
you get around in the dark.

42:46.620 --> 42:48.103
- So you do this a lot?

42:49.110 --> 42:50.150
Ghost hunting.

42:50.150 --> 42:53.840
- Well, I don't really
necessarily think of it as hunting

42:53.840 --> 42:56.070
because you can't do anything to a ghost.

42:56.070 --> 42:59.170
It's more like seeking or investigating.

42:59.170 --> 43:04.170
There's no jumpsuits,
plasma guns or ghost traps.

43:04.540 --> 43:07.630
- So the seeking thing, do
you just like walk around

43:07.630 --> 43:09.920
and ask questions in the dark?

43:09.920 --> 43:11.240
- That's just on TV.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.393
I just go in, stand still.

43:14.650 --> 43:18.053
The conditions are right,
maybe something will happen.

43:21.160 --> 43:23.293
Here, can you cut that open for me?

43:26.180 --> 43:27.787
- You're saying something
in the barn made him sick?

43:27.787 --> 43:30.250
No, he was sick before we got here.

43:30.250 --> 43:34.073
- But did he spend time here
in the farm after he got sick?

43:36.000 --> 43:37.640
- I mean, yeah, I guess once
he started feeling better,

43:37.640 --> 43:40.180
he wanted to come out and
explore, help me move some things.

43:40.180 --> 43:42.610
What does it have to do with being sick?

43:42.610 --> 43:44.130
- He's an Indigo.

43:44.130 --> 43:44.963
- Maybe.

43:45.860 --> 43:47.290
- Indigo?

43:47.290 --> 43:48.520
What's that?

43:48.520 --> 43:50.530
- Some people, usually kids,

43:50.530 --> 43:53.200
pick up on supernatural energies.

43:53.200 --> 43:56.410
Sometimes it happens
after they get real sick,

43:56.410 --> 43:58.978
bad fever, almost die.

43:58.978 --> 43:59.980
- In case it's like a real thing,

43:59.980 --> 44:01.990
do I actually need to
see a doctor about it?

44:01.990 --> 44:03.370
- No.

44:03.370 --> 44:07.860
He may just be extra sensitive
to different energies.

44:07.860 --> 44:08.880
You take him to a doctor,

44:08.880 --> 44:10.970
they're probably just gonna
give him pills or shots

44:10.970 --> 44:13.653
or call it a mental illness.

44:14.560 --> 44:17.503
- The shots are bad,
pills were okay sometimes.

44:19.050 --> 44:19.960
- So when you say extra sensitive,

44:19.960 --> 44:22.243
do you mean just like
afraid of everything?

44:23.330 --> 44:24.930
- It's easy to be scared

44:24.930 --> 44:28.510
of something you don't
know anything about.

44:28.510 --> 44:30.870
Hopefully he'll just
learn to deal with it.

44:30.870 --> 44:33.090
- That's why Mrs. Apple is here.

44:33.090 --> 44:34.217
You said she was the one
that showed up in the woods

44:34.217 --> 44:37.163
back when you saw that
thing when you were a cop.

44:38.410 --> 44:41.260
She here to turn my son into
some kind of monster hunter?

44:44.780 --> 44:47.713
- Troy and I are gonna take
a walk and run some tests.

44:48.650 --> 44:52.620
Why don't you go do some
baseline recordings for me?

44:52.620 --> 44:54.620
I'll start downstairs.

44:54.620 --> 44:55.683
- We'll catch up.

44:57.880 --> 44:59.143
- How can he see?

45:00.340 --> 45:01.403
- It's a long story.

45:02.920 --> 45:04.130
- Let's go, young man.

45:04.130 --> 45:05.880
We'll catch up with you guys later.

45:08.700 --> 45:11.363
- Look, we're not here
to try to recruit him.

45:12.250 --> 45:14.943
We're here to check the
place for anything dangerous,

45:16.200 --> 45:18.713
but I also think it's a
good idea to help Troy.

45:20.470 --> 45:22.097
I suspected he was sensitive

45:22.097 --> 45:24.293
and I called Apple in just in case.

45:26.310 --> 45:27.713
I think she can help him.

45:30.610 --> 45:32.190
- Well, you guys got
him to come to the barn.

45:32.190 --> 45:34.870
So that's always a step
in the right direction.

45:34.870 --> 45:36.713
- I don't think that was just us.

45:37.617 --> 45:40.883
I think it was how you reacted
today and your example.

45:42.860 --> 45:45.933
He needs to see that people
don't have to be scared.

45:48.150 --> 45:50.523
- He may not have seen
it, but I was terrified.

45:50.523 --> 45:52.580
I still am, not of the bear,

45:52.580 --> 45:56.173
but just for him and Carrie and Linda.

45:57.270 --> 45:58.360
We're so far out here in the country,

45:58.360 --> 45:59.710
if anything were to happen,

46:00.830 --> 46:02.480
take a long time to get any help.

46:05.410 --> 46:06.243
- I understand.

46:10.090 --> 46:11.103
Let's go find Sans.

46:26.270 --> 46:27.547
- Tell me what you feel.

46:27.547 --> 46:29.823
- You mean here in the dark?

46:30.930 --> 46:33.230
- No, I mean, what do you feel anytime?

46:33.230 --> 46:34.653
- I'm scared all the time.

46:35.810 --> 46:37.560
- Do you know what's making you so scared?

46:37.560 --> 46:40.140
- No, I'm just scared of this house,

46:40.140 --> 46:43.883
the barn, the woods,
the water, everything.

46:44.760 --> 46:45.623
- Why are you so afraid?

46:45.623 --> 46:47.633
- I don't know, I just am.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.080
- It's okay.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.373
Just relax for a minute.

46:54.059 --> 46:57.607
I want you to close
your eyes and just feel.

47:05.820 --> 47:07.053
- I feel something.

47:10.150 --> 47:11.233
It's weird.

47:12.140 --> 47:13.073
Why is it glowing?

47:16.600 --> 47:17.854
- There's energy here.

47:23.150 --> 47:24.050
- Did you hear it?

47:25.000 --> 47:25.833
- Yes.

47:26.940 --> 47:28.516
Let's go look.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.156
- Are you hearing anything?

48:05.156 --> 48:07.087
- Static, and your loud ass.

48:08.324 --> 48:09.157
- Can I listen?

48:18.810 --> 48:20.749
- Wow, I can hear...

48:20.749 --> 48:22.310
I can hear the crickets outside.

48:22.310 --> 48:24.040
Man, my voice is really loud.

48:24.040 --> 48:25.560
- I know.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.873
Listen to the room.

48:26.873 --> 48:28.073
What do you hear?

48:32.290 --> 48:36.083
- Sans breathing, the wind outside,

48:38.000 --> 48:39.943
maybe the waves in the bay,

48:42.573 --> 48:45.077
your stomach rumbling from
all those apples you ate.

48:48.410 --> 48:49.323
Something else.

48:52.400 --> 48:53.443
A rustling sound.

48:56.480 --> 48:57.863
Metal clinking.

49:08.090 --> 49:09.303
I hear something.

49:10.531 --> 49:11.623
Is somebody up here?

49:12.630 --> 49:14.260
What do you feel?

49:14.260 --> 49:17.177
- I see someone, someone's up here.

49:18.370 --> 49:19.203
- But what do you feel?

49:21.020 --> 49:22.610
Ghostly whisper

49:22.610 --> 49:23.443
- I have to go.

49:23.443 --> 49:25.890
- Wait, it's okay, Troy.

49:25.890 --> 49:27.020
You can face this.

49:27.020 --> 49:28.090
- No, I'm leaving.

49:28.090 --> 49:28.923
- Wait.

49:31.150 --> 49:32.233
It's a young woman.

49:33.500 --> 49:36.103
Her name is Jean.
- Please, just let me go.

49:38.320 --> 49:39.643
- Jean Summers.

49:41.030 --> 49:43.273
She lived or worked here long ago.

49:44.560 --> 49:45.983
She found love here.

49:48.360 --> 49:50.960
Lived her life, had children.

49:50.960 --> 49:52.243
How do you know?

49:54.710 --> 49:57.060
- It's clearly written in her energy.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.190
She loved it here.

49:59.190 --> 50:01.243
She likes to visit sometimes.

50:03.730 --> 50:06.393
I think probably others do as well.

50:12.380 --> 50:16.047
Why don't you close
your eyes and just feel.

50:33.462 --> 50:34.295
ghostly whispers

50:46.714 --> 50:48.187
- What happened?

50:48.187 --> 50:50.103
- You disrupted her energy.

50:56.070 --> 50:56.903
- So...

50:59.020 --> 51:00.830
I can see ghosts now?

51:00.830 --> 51:03.763
- Something happened to make
you able to sense things.

51:05.260 --> 51:09.830
- But nobody believes me,
mom and dad don't believe me.

51:09.830 --> 51:11.280
I didn't wanna be here.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.990
It didn't feel right,
but they never listen.

51:13.990 --> 51:16.020
Nobody gets it.

51:16.020 --> 51:16.853
I'm afraid.

51:16.853 --> 51:18.773
Why won't anybody listen to me?

51:20.560 --> 51:21.883
- Are you afraid though?

51:24.290 --> 51:26.890
You just saw a ghost and
you even tried to touch it,

51:28.170 --> 51:29.120
and you didn't run away

51:29.120 --> 51:31.513
when you saw that creature
in the woods today.

51:32.810 --> 51:34.983
Doesn't look like you're
that scared to me.

51:36.740 --> 51:37.740
- Well, I guess not.

51:39.140 --> 51:40.640
You knew about me, didn't you?

51:41.610 --> 51:42.560
You're here for me.

51:44.340 --> 51:46.373
- Diego thought you might be sensitive.

51:47.850 --> 51:49.650
She and Sans are pretty dense,

51:49.650 --> 51:53.660
but they have good
instincts most of the time.

51:53.660 --> 51:55.310
They asked me to check in on you.

51:56.690 --> 51:59.653
- So what happens next?

52:02.450 --> 52:05.610
- You practice it or you lock it down.

52:05.610 --> 52:07.070
It's your choice.

52:07.070 --> 52:10.293
- You mean I can block out
the feelings, the senses?

52:11.590 --> 52:12.423
- Most do.

52:17.614 --> 52:20.020
I think we've seen enough here tonight.

52:20.020 --> 52:21.720
Let's go catch up with the others.

52:23.577 --> 52:24.852
- Okay.

52:41.934 --> 52:42.767
- Everything okay?

52:42.767 --> 52:43.810
- Yeah, it's cool.

52:43.810 --> 52:45.750
- Find anything interesting?

52:45.750 --> 52:47.750
- Oh, well, just some minor energies.

52:47.750 --> 52:49.150
Nothing to worry about.

52:49.150 --> 52:51.350
- Minor energies as in ghosts?

52:51.350 --> 52:54.940
- It's okay, dad, it's just
memories from the past.

52:54.940 --> 52:58.193
I guess I was just scared
of all this history stuff.

52:59.930 --> 53:03.010
- Well, I think I am
going to go to the house

53:03.010 --> 53:05.180
and have a cup of tea with Linda.

53:05.180 --> 53:06.290
Will you walk with me?

53:06.290 --> 53:07.123
- Sure.

53:14.810 --> 53:15.643
- Troy.

53:17.860 --> 53:19.680
Did you see a ghost?

53:19.680 --> 53:20.620
- Oh, yes.

53:20.620 --> 53:23.980
There was this big scary one
stomping around everywhere.

53:23.980 --> 53:25.330
I even got it on camera.

53:25.330 --> 53:28.250
Mr. Sans says it was the
biggest, scariest ghost

53:28.250 --> 53:29.658
you've ever seen.

53:29.658 --> 53:33.580
- Okay, but seriously,
did you see a ghost?

53:33.580 --> 53:35.943
- Are you sure you wanna know if I did?

53:35.943 --> 53:38.544
- I don't know, maybe.

53:38.544 --> 53:39.377
- Maybe.

54:00.680 --> 54:02.739
- What creatures have you seen?

54:02.739 --> 54:03.760
- Depends on what you call a creature.

54:03.760 --> 54:06.840
- You know, big foots and yetis and stuff.

54:06.840 --> 54:08.160
- Big foot is a yeti.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.380
Big foot came across the last ice age,

54:10.380 --> 54:12.230
he's kind of an explorer.

54:12.230 --> 54:13.800
- There's only one?

54:13.800 --> 54:14.870
- There's only one here,

54:14.870 --> 54:17.650
but there's a bunch of
yetis in the Himalayas.

54:17.650 --> 54:18.970
- How old are they?

54:18.970 --> 54:20.550
- I didn't think to ask.

54:20.550 --> 54:22.740
I wanna look at that tree line.

54:22.740 --> 54:23.907
- You're weird, Mr. Sans.

54:23.907 --> 54:25.398
- And you're adopted.

54:25.398 --> 54:26.231
- What!

54:26.231 --> 54:27.790
- I wanna look at these trees over here.

54:27.790 --> 54:29.110
Try to keep up, kid.

54:29.110 --> 54:30.560
- He's just messing with you.

54:32.098 --> 54:33.006
Harpy!

54:42.670 --> 54:43.503
- What were you shooting at?

54:43.503 --> 54:45.800
- He saw a hippy.

54:45.800 --> 54:47.360
- I think he said harpy.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.513
It's a bird woman, right?

54:50.530 --> 54:52.280
- It wasn't a harpy.

54:52.280 --> 54:53.900
- What was it?

54:53.900 --> 54:55.000
- It was a goose.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.770
- How do you mistake a goose
for a harpy in broad daylight?

54:58.770 --> 55:00.860
A goose doesn't look
anything like a harpy,

55:00.860 --> 55:01.800
it doesn't have...

55:01.800 --> 55:02.940
Really?

55:02.940 --> 55:04.090
- It was an ugly goose.

55:11.090 --> 55:11.950
Did he hit it?

55:11.950 --> 55:13.560
- Not even close.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.843
- It was an ugly goose.

55:14.843 --> 55:16.426
- It was very ugly.

55:30.013 --> 55:31.293
- So what happens now?

55:33.200 --> 55:34.063
- Depends on you.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.610
Did Mrs. Apple help?

55:36.610 --> 55:38.200
- I think so.

55:38.200 --> 55:40.980
I just want people to stop
bugging my mom and dad.

55:40.980 --> 55:41.813
- Well, you know what,

55:41.813 --> 55:43.850
we'll send out a message
to some of our friends

55:43.850 --> 55:45.710
and they'll find something else

55:45.710 --> 55:47.413
for the SpookTubers to focus on.

55:55.890 --> 56:00.100
- Ms. Diego, Mr. Sans, thank
you guys so much for staying

56:00.100 --> 56:03.100
and for all of the excitement.

56:03.100 --> 56:06.633
- Maybe you two can come back
and get married or something.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.233
- Bye.

56:18.070 --> 56:19.357
- Well, they were interesting.

56:19.357 --> 56:21.550
- But what about Troy's video?

56:21.550 --> 56:25.130
Are we gonna catch a break
from all the weirdos?

56:25.130 --> 56:27.440
- Hopefully if Ms. Diego said
something to their people.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.273
Probably wouldn't hurt

56:28.273 --> 56:30.670
if he started posting about
a different topic as well.

56:30.670 --> 56:32.770
Think he'd be willing to help
me on my tractor channel?

56:32.770 --> 56:34.320
- Give him some time.

56:34.320 --> 56:37.363
I think he needs some distance
away from all the weirdness.

56:50.860 --> 56:53.020
You gonna make a video?

56:53.020 --> 56:55.630
- No, I'm probably gonna take a break.

56:55.630 --> 56:58.760
Too many haters out there
to pick apart my videos.

56:58.760 --> 57:01.710
- But you did catch something,
you can't say it's fake.

57:01.710 --> 57:03.280
- Well, that's the thing,

57:03.280 --> 57:06.483
if you stop posting, then
people stop watching.

57:07.510 --> 57:10.723
- You mean like the
Freekie-707's Elf in a Box?

57:11.590 --> 57:12.423
- Maybe.

57:13.480 --> 57:16.140
- Can you help me make a makeup video?

57:16.140 --> 57:18.940
- Well, I don't know if makeup
will help much, but okay.

57:19.887 --> 57:21.410
- Hey!

57:21.410 --> 57:24.360
- Look, you go film something
and I'll help you edit later.

57:24.360 --> 57:25.834
I'm gonna go shoot some hoops.

57:36.049 --> 57:36.882
Girl!

57:42.589 --> 57:45.190
- Today, I'm gonna be talking
about what animals to-

57:45.190 --> 57:47.949
- Hey, babe, I'm gonna lock up
the barn, I'll be right back.

57:47.949 --> 57:48.782
Okay.

57:56.524 --> 57:57.357
Distant chanting

57:59.490 --> 58:00.323
- Hey!

58:01.250 --> 58:02.103
Hello!

58:06.280 --> 58:08.070
Private property, if you wanna explore,

58:08.070 --> 58:11.003
you need to come check
in with us in the house.

59:12.512 --> 59:15.853
Mom, dad, you guys in here?

59:16.910 --> 59:18.713
Carrie, are you here?

1:00:29.498 --> 1:00:30.331
- Easy, kid.

1:00:31.341 --> 1:00:33.091
It's okay, it's okay.

1:00:35.091 --> 1:00:40.023
- Ms. Diego, Mr. Sans,
I thought you guys left.

1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:44.980
Everybody's gone and I saw these people,

1:00:44.980 --> 1:00:47.113
I think they took them into the barn.

1:00:48.630 --> 1:00:49.463
- We saw, kid.

1:00:49.463 --> 1:00:50.560
That's why we're here.

1:00:51.610 --> 1:00:53.170
- You saw them?

1:00:53.170 --> 1:00:56.670
- We set up wireless trail
cameras to watch the back area.

1:00:56.670 --> 1:00:59.840
We were gonna come collect
'em in a month or two.

1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:01.890
- Diego thought we
should do a system check.

1:01:01.890 --> 1:01:04.490
We were going down the road,
that's when we saw 'em.

1:01:05.540 --> 1:01:06.740
- You saw what happened?

1:01:08.750 --> 1:01:11.440
- Several figures going into the barn.

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:13.240
One of 'em was carrying your sister.

1:01:14.370 --> 1:01:16.500
- My phone was busted so
I couldn't call the cops

1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:19.220
and dad's gun was gone too.

1:01:19.220 --> 1:01:20.967
I have to go help them.

1:01:20.967 --> 1:01:21.800
- No.

1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:24.900
We put a call in, we have to move.

1:01:24.900 --> 1:01:25.733
You stay here.

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:31.127
- You hear that?

1:01:32.290 --> 1:01:34.520
- No, this is not the time.

1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:36.100
Look, we have a family in danger,

1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:38.550
this is not the time for
you to go all Rambo on me.

1:01:38.550 --> 1:01:40.800
- Dammit, Diego.
- I know.

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:43.710
You'll get your chance, after.

1:01:43.710 --> 1:01:44.543
We gotta move.

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:01.263
What are you doing?

1:02:05.950 --> 1:02:06.783
Damn it!

1:02:08.251 --> 1:02:10.140
- He must have went in alone.

1:02:10.140 --> 1:02:10.973
- Idiot.

1:02:11.820 --> 1:02:13.320
- Seems pretty brave to me.

1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:14.863
- Not him, you.

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:34.200
We need to split up.

1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:36.290
You go right, I'll go left.

1:02:36.290 --> 1:02:37.476
- Roger that.

1:03:06.061 --> 1:03:08.261
chanting

1:03:35.820 --> 1:03:36.653
Oh, what the hell.

1:04:09.785 --> 1:04:11.179
Diego, where are you?

1:04:11.179 --> 1:04:12.553
- I'm behind you,

1:04:12.553 --> 1:04:15.052
but, go, we need to hurry!

1:04:28.601 --> 1:04:29.751
- Troy, help me!

1:04:29.751 --> 1:04:30.918
Help me, Troy!

1:05:01.708 --> 1:05:03.453
- Thanks, partner.

1:05:03.453 --> 1:05:04.286
- Tired of saving your ass.

1:05:24.738 --> 1:05:26.954
- No! Come Back!

1:05:35.583 --> 1:05:37.338
- You little shit!
- No!

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:07.793
- I just came out to close up the barn.

1:06:09.770 --> 1:06:13.403
Next thing I know, I'm
waking up with my hands tied.

1:06:16.550 --> 1:06:17.683
The Crypto Hunters.

1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:20.493
Mr. Sans, Ms. Diego,

1:06:21.930 --> 1:06:23.630
they said they were gonna kill us.

1:06:26.118 --> 1:06:27.218
And Troy stopped them.

1:06:29.705 --> 1:06:31.003
Now he won't talk about it.

1:06:32.930 --> 1:06:35.530
- What do you mean, he
won't talk about it?

1:06:35.530 --> 1:06:38.243
- He hasn't said anything since .... this.

1:06:40.950 --> 1:06:42.550
- Could be shock.

1:06:42.550 --> 1:06:44.450
I'll check back for a statement later.

1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:49.000
But Diego's pretty solid and
she says your son helped,

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.650
then she means it.

1:06:50.650 --> 1:06:52.760
Good thing to Crypto Hunters were here.

1:06:53.810 --> 1:06:55.030
- Yeah, I guess so.

1:06:55.030 --> 1:06:57.953
- That asshole killed my cat.

1:06:59.190 --> 1:07:00.590
- I'm sorry, Ms. Morgan.

1:07:00.590 --> 1:07:01.990
I'll add that to the report.

1:07:18.990 --> 1:07:21.633
- Now you said no fatalities by you?

1:07:22.630 --> 1:07:24.675
- No Cryptos, no fatalities.

1:07:24.675 --> 1:07:25.530
- How?

1:07:25.530 --> 1:07:27.180
- We saw they were Nervii,

1:07:27.180 --> 1:07:29.970
so we loaded some
non-lethals and zip-ties.

1:07:29.970 --> 1:07:31.710
There's some more around the
back of the barn, by the way.

1:07:31.710 --> 1:07:33.983
- What the hell is a Nervii?

1:07:35.180 --> 1:07:36.890
- They're Druids or jackasses

1:07:36.890 --> 1:07:38.690
that think that they're druids.

1:07:38.690 --> 1:07:41.180
They saw the Morgans
were gonna be here alone,

1:07:41.180 --> 1:07:44.530
so they thought they would
have some satanic ritual,

1:07:44.530 --> 1:07:47.910
raise the dead, blood orgy shit.

1:07:47.910 --> 1:07:49.443
Get some kind of eternal power.

1:07:53.241 --> 1:07:54.491
- Did they raise a demon?

1:07:55.470 --> 1:07:56.303
- Almost.

1:07:58.320 --> 1:07:59.237
- And this guy?

1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.263
- Shaving accident.

1:08:04.096 --> 1:08:05.674
- Oh.

1:08:14.850 --> 1:08:16.540
- Sans told me what he saw.

1:08:16.540 --> 1:08:17.740
You wanna talk about it?

1:08:21.150 --> 1:08:21.983
Okay.

1:08:23.870 --> 1:08:25.680
When things settle, shoot me an email,

1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:27.430
and we'll set something up for you.

1:08:28.810 --> 1:08:31.113
The world's gonna look very different now.

1:08:33.300 --> 1:08:35.430
They're never gonna understand
what you did tonight

1:08:35.430 --> 1:08:36.533
or what it cost you.

1:08:38.376 --> 1:08:39.893
But don't let that eat you up.

1:08:41.100 --> 1:08:44.803
We'll find a way to get you through this.

1:08:46.410 --> 1:08:50.110
You did something
remarkably brave tonight.

1:08:50.110 --> 1:08:52.480
Your family is alive because of it.

1:09:34.220 --> 1:09:35.890
- Diego called.

1:09:35.890 --> 1:09:39.033
Said you finished your training,
said you're ready to hunt.

1:09:41.990 --> 1:09:45.113
You got bigger, but
you got a lot to learn.

1:09:46.110 --> 1:09:47.833
So, gear up, rook, we got a case!

1:10:36.670 --> 1:10:40.560
- So basically it's been
five years since TroJam's

1:10:41.393 --> 1:10:42.730
video went viral.

1:10:42.730 --> 1:10:45.840
I knew he was fraud all
along, they all are.

1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:48.170
I was the only one who saw anything

1:10:48.170 --> 1:10:50.700
and I've got the real thing right here.

1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:53.387
And you guys say that
it's not real, but it is.

1:10:53.387 --> 1:10:56.490
It has been verified by a former hunter

1:10:56.490 --> 1:10:58.610
and he says that I have to keep it quiet.

1:10:58.610 --> 1:10:59.690
Screw that!

1:10:59.690 --> 1:11:00.930
I'm gonna be famous,

1:11:00.930 --> 1:11:03.020
I'm gonna be on all the shows like-

1:11:03.020 --> 1:11:05.610
Georgie, there's
someone here to see you!

1:11:05.610 --> 1:11:07.970
- Mom, I'm recording a vlog.

1:11:07.970 --> 1:11:09.580
Tell them I'm busy!

1:11:09.580 --> 1:11:13.039
I know, Georgie, but
Georgie, what's a dry ass?

1:11:13.039 --> 1:11:14.320
- Dryad, mom!

1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:16.440
- It's pronounced Dryad.

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:17.910
Right, that's what the man

1:11:17.910 --> 1:11:19.480
said he wanted to talk about,

1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:21.314
says his name is Sans, you know him?

1:11:22.210 --> 1:11:23.975
- Oh, shit!
- Where's the Dryad?

1:11:23.975 --> 1:11:25.295
- I-
- Cobra pig!

1:11:36.712 --> 1:11:39.166
You got anything to say here?
