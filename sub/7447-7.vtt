38:42.000 --> 38:44.720
Alright, mate. Let's go.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.870
No, not you.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.156
Just wait outside.

38:57.320 --> 38:59.360
Your Highness.

38:59.360 --> 39:02.272
(SIGHS) My beautiful boy.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.440
<i>Guido Calletti could never stay out of</i>
<i>trouble for long.</i>

39:36.440 --> 39:40.880
<i>And he could never resist the lure</i>
<i>of a drunk with a loaded wallet.</i>

39:40.880 --> 39:44.480
<i>a handy bit of timber.</i>
<i>and a secluded laneway.</i>

39:44.480 --> 39:48.598
<i>It was only a matter of time</i>
<i>before he was locked up for good.</i>

39:53.080 --> 39:55.196
Give my regards to the Bay, dago.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.960
<i>Which meant Nellie Cameron</i>

40:03.960 --> 40:06.400
<i>was going to have to wait</i>
<i>for her diamond ring.</i>

40:06.400 --> 40:09.870
<i>But perhaps she had other things</i>
<i>to think about.</i>

40:23.520 --> 40:25.760
<i>With Guido out of circulation.</i>

40:25.760 --> 40:29.992
<i>she fell back into the arms</i>
<i>of the Little Gunman. Frank Green.</i>

40:42.560 --> 40:47.236
<i>The girl they called Black Aggie turned</i>
<i>her back on prostitution.</i>

40:49.560 --> 40:52.200
<i>She was looking forward</i>
<i>to a bright future</i>

40:52.200 --> 40:56.159
<i>with her new love.</i>
<i>Greg 'The Gunman' Gaffney.</i>

41:07.600 --> 41:09.080
<i>And Queen Tilly?</i>

41:09.080 --> 41:14.080
<i>Well. Queen Tilly was moving her court</i>
<i>from the loins of temptation.</i>

41:14.080 --> 41:16.360
<i>all the way out to the suburbs.</i>

41:16.360 --> 41:19.560
Don't even come this far
for me holidays. Who lives here?

41:19.560 --> 41:21.391
We do.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.079
Mmm! It's a palace.

41:36.040 --> 41:39.160
<i>Which only left Wally Tomlinson.</i>

41:39.160 --> 41:42.560
<i>cuckolded by the woman he loved.</i>

41:42.560 --> 41:45.950
<i>What on earth</i>
<i>was a man supposed to do?</i>

41:48.160 --> 41:51.118

41:53.480 --> 41:54.913
