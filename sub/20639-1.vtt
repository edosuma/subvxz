Bye.

02:32.700 --> 02:35.728
-You're home early.
-Yeah.

02:35.828 --> 02:37.355
And aren't you supposed to be
doing some homework?

02:37.455 --> 02:38.954
Yes, I did some.

02:40.792 --> 02:42.986
-And the kids?
-Tia went to bed early

02:43.086 --> 02:44.862
and David's down
at his friend Anthony's.

02:44.962 --> 02:47.240
-What?
-He went downstairs.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.700
Oh, Sheila, I told you

02:48.800 --> 02:50.326
not to let the kids
out of this house.

02:50.426 --> 02:51.661
He said you said
it was all right.

02:51.761 --> 02:53.928
-No!
-I'm sorry.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.043
-What do you want?
-Where is David?

02:59.143 --> 03:00.336
David ain't in here.

03:00.436 --> 03:01.796
Don't talk crap to me,
Anthony.

03:01.896 --> 03:03.756
I told you, he ain't here.

03:03.856 --> 03:05.383
Hey, get off me.
You ain't my momma.

03:05.483 --> 03:07.176
Where is your momma?

03:07.276 --> 03:08.818
Fine,
I'm calling the cops.

03:10.530 --> 03:12.181
Cool. Cool.

03:12.281 --> 03:13.766
Yo, David.

03:13.866 --> 03:15.226
Hey, come on, son.
Come on.

03:15.326 --> 03:16.769
Let's go, go home
to mommy, son.

03:16.869 --> 03:18.563
-Go to mommy.
-You gotta be kidding me.

03:18.663 --> 03:20.815
-You got to be kidding.
 -And don't come back, neither.

03:20.915 --> 03:22.483
How many times
I got to tell you, David.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.902
I just went down there
for a few minutes, chill.

03:25.002 --> 03:26.446
-Chill?
-Don't you be smacking me.

03:26.546 --> 03:28.281
-I'm not a little kid.
-You are a kid.

03:28.381 --> 03:30.074
-Have you been drinking?
-Keep your hands off me.

03:30.174 --> 03:31.409
...because I smelled it
in the party there.

03:31.509 --> 03:32.535
Don't run from me, David.

03:32.635 --> 03:34.245
Let go of me.

03:34.345 --> 03:35.928
Oh!

03:37.473 --> 03:38.750
Oh, my, God, David.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.335
Oh, my, God, David.
Are you okay?

03:40.435 --> 03:42.253
- Are you okay, David?
-I'm fine.

03:42.353 --> 03:44.756
--Sheila, shut the door and go.

03:44.856 --> 03:47.675
Tia, get Mommy a wet cloth
and a Band-Aid box. Run.

03:47.775 --> 03:48.926
Does it hurt?

03:49.026 --> 03:51.179
It just-- It just stings
a little.

03:51.279 --> 03:52.528
Thank you, baby.

03:54.824 --> 03:56.559
Oh, my, God.

03:56.659 --> 04:00.772
Oh, it's just a small cut.

04:00.872 --> 04:02.357
It missed your eye
by a few inches.

04:02.457 --> 04:04.400
It's fine.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.402
Listen to me, David.

04:06.502 --> 04:09.405
That Anthony and his friends
are poison.

04:09.505 --> 04:10.865
Next time, I'm gonna call
the cops on his mother.

04:10.965 --> 04:12.867
-No. No.
-Yes. You had no business

04:12.967 --> 04:14.369
-being down there, baby.
-No, Mommy. No.

04:14.469 --> 04:15.787
Mom, please.

04:15.887 --> 04:17.970
David going
to the hospital?

04:19.348 --> 04:20.348
No.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.670
You see? You see?
It stopped.

04:23.770 --> 04:26.047
The bleeding has stopped.

04:26.147 --> 04:28.049
Don't touch it, please.
Don't touch.

04:28.149 --> 04:30.093
-Good. Okay.
 -You go back to bed now, okay?

04:30.193 --> 04:31.886
-I'll be there soon. Go.
-Love you, Mom.

04:31.986 --> 04:33.513
I love you too.

04:33.613 --> 04:34.764
I'm gonna put a Band-Aid

04:34.864 --> 04:36.530
and everything
is gonna be okay.

04:40.870 --> 04:42.536
Oh, David.

04:49.045 --> 04:50.711
I love you.

04:58.012 --> 05:00.498
Welcome home
to our empty nest.

05:00.598 --> 05:02.125
Don't remind me.

05:02.225 --> 05:05.086
I'm calling.
Pick your poison.

05:05.186 --> 05:06.921
Moo shu, please.

05:07.021 --> 05:09.063
Moo shu for two.

05:12.026 --> 05:15.096
 Tuesday, 2:51 p.m.

05:15.196 --> 05:16.556
 Hey, Sis.

05:16.656 --> 05:17.974
I hope everything
went smoothly

05:18.074 --> 05:19.976
getting Elliot
off to college.

05:20.076 --> 05:22.395
I want you to know
that Dad called.

05:22.495 --> 05:24.605
He fell and hurt his shoulder
this afternoon,

05:24.705 --> 05:27.650
so I'm taking him
to the doctor in the morning.

05:27.750 --> 05:31.738
-Call me.
-Ugh. Just shot me.

05:31.838 --> 05:33.322
 And everyone
is asking themselves,

05:33.422 --> 05:35.116
how did this happen?

05:35.216 --> 05:36.492
How did five-year-old,

05:36.592 --> 05:38.453
Sofia Martinez
starved to death

05:38.553 --> 05:40.621
in her very own home?

05:40.721 --> 05:42.999
Apparently, all of the doors
in the apartment were locked.

05:43.099 --> 05:44.876
Neighbors say
the little girl's mother

05:44.976 --> 05:47.253
had lost custody of the child
over a year ago

05:47.353 --> 05:49.130
but the girl
had been reunited

05:49.230 --> 05:51.299
with her recently
after she was released

05:51.399 --> 05:53.384
from a drug rehabilitation
program.

05:53.484 --> 05:55.776
Police are now searching
for the mother.

05:59.907 --> 06:03.936
Oh, I am beyond beat.
Aren't you exhausted?

06:04.036 --> 06:06.773
To put it mildly
but I'm also wired.

06:06.873 --> 06:08.858
Well, I've got that
early flight to Boston.

06:08.958 --> 06:10.568
That deal still
isn't done yet?

06:10.668 --> 06:13.738
Hopefully tomorrow.

06:13.838 --> 06:16.032
Would you mind reading
in the other room?

06:16.132 --> 06:17.283
Oh, no, not at all.

06:17.383 --> 06:18.826
-Kiss me.
-Oh.

06:18.926 --> 06:19.967
All right.

08:01.404 --> 08:02.528
Martha?

08:04.156 --> 08:07.602
-Honey?
-Oh, gosh.

08:07.702 --> 08:09.145
I can't believe
I fell asleep in here, Jesus.

08:09.245 --> 08:11.063
Listen, I got to get
to the airport.

08:11.163 --> 08:12.815
Oh, what time is it?

08:12.915 --> 08:15.526
7:00 a.m. I wasn't sure
 when you were seeing your dad.

08:15.626 --> 08:17.668
No, no, no.
I'm glad you woke me up.

08:20.381 --> 08:21.714
Are you okay?

08:23.426 --> 08:25.620
Elliot is not gone
for good, honey.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.538
I know, and I hate it
when you call me honey.

08:27.638 --> 08:28.873
I've always
called you honey.

08:28.973 --> 08:30.750
I know
and I've always hated it.

08:30.850 --> 08:33.085
Okay.

08:33.184 --> 08:36.212
Look, I know it's weird
with him gone.

08:36.313 --> 08:37.548
It's not weird.
It's just sad.

08:37.648 --> 08:38.966
I think it would be sad

08:39.066 --> 08:40.467
if he didn't wanna go
to college.

08:40.568 --> 08:43.318
Jason, let me process this
in my own way.

08:45.531 --> 08:48.115
You can't put words
 to what I'm feeling right now.

08:51.829 --> 08:53.648
Okay.

08:53.748 --> 08:55.399
I'll see you tonight.

08:55.499 --> 08:56.915
Have a good trip.

09:00.046 --> 09:02.114
I wanna make it
to Dante's soccer game today

09:02.214 --> 09:03.824
but Manny's got
a Parent-Teacher conference.

09:03.924 --> 09:05.242
Oh, I didn't know
that was today.

09:05.342 --> 09:06.994
 -What time is the soccer game?
-4:00 p.m.

09:07.094 --> 09:09.121
I'll never make that.
I'm in the field today.

09:09.221 --> 09:10.471
Yeah, he knows.

09:12.141 --> 09:13.599
This is one of my cases.

09:16.228 --> 09:18.839
Jesus.

09:18.939 --> 09:20.675
Why didn't
you say something?

09:20.775 --> 09:23.761
 I had no idea it was gonna get
this kind of attention.

09:23.861 --> 09:25.596
-What happened?
-Oh, believe me.

09:25.696 --> 09:27.807
Nothing you wanna hear about
first thing in the morning.

09:27.907 --> 09:29.417
Don't worry about it.

09:29.617 --> 09:31.825
I gotta go.
You better get your ass moving too.

09:35.122 --> 09:37.748
Do you think Manny could ever
pick up one of his toys?

09:46.383 --> 09:48.619
All right.
Let's quiet down.

09:48.719 --> 09:50.329
Take out your journals.

09:50.429 --> 09:53.624
I want you to begin today

09:53.724 --> 09:55.042
by doing an entry

09:55.142 --> 09:57.920
about our trip
to the museum tomorrow.

09:58.020 --> 09:59.964
I wanna know specifically
which exhibit

10:00.064 --> 10:01.882
that you are going--

10:01.982 --> 10:04.552
David, wake up.

10:04.652 --> 10:07.722
Did you forget to sleep
last night?

10:07.822 --> 10:09.863
Take out your journal
and listen up.

10:13.786 --> 10:14.854
And how did you
get these marks

10:14.954 --> 10:16.036
on your arms?

10:17.706 --> 10:19.483
I don't know.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.777
It seems very odd, David,
that you wouldn't know

10:21.877 --> 10:24.238
how you got these bruises.

10:24.338 --> 10:27.616
I fell.
Can I go back to class now?

10:27.716 --> 10:29.994
I'd like you to stay here
a while and rest.

10:30.094 --> 10:31.454
Okay?

10:31.554 --> 10:32.970
Go on.

10:37.685 --> 10:40.811
Get him to a doctor.
I'm gonna call ACS.

10:43.607 --> 10:45.885
Well, hello.

10:45.985 --> 10:47.526
You must be Tia.

10:48.904 --> 10:50.931
You come and sit
right over here.

10:51.031 --> 10:52.239
Thank you.

10:54.577 --> 10:56.020
Would you like some juice?

10:56.120 --> 10:57.104
Yes, please.

10:57.204 --> 10:58.245
Good.

11:03.544 --> 11:05.112
Did I do something wrong?

11:05.212 --> 11:06.530
No, sweetheart.

11:06.630 --> 11:09.158
You didn't do
anything wrong.

11:09.258 --> 11:12.259
Mr. Sanjuro here just wants
to ask you a few questions.

11:17.308 --> 11:18.959
Hi, Tia.

11:19.059 --> 11:20.419
-Hi.
-How are you?

11:20.519 --> 11:22.880
I'm very pleased
to meet you.

11:22.980 --> 11:25.257
I'm gonna ask you
a few questions, okay?

11:25.357 --> 11:28.469
What's
your favorite color?

11:28.569 --> 11:29.970
-Purple.
-Purple?

11:30.070 --> 11:33.641
And what's your favorite
kind of juice?

11:33.741 --> 11:34.823
Apple.

11:36.702 --> 11:39.620
Did something happen
at your house last night?

11:56.180 --> 11:58.624
Come dancing with me
tonight.

11:58.724 --> 12:00.599
Who goes dancing
on a week night?

12:03.938 --> 12:06.048
-Mr. Christian!
-Sara.

12:06.148 --> 12:07.633
Wow.

12:07.733 --> 12:10.094
You look really
handsome today.

12:10.194 --> 12:12.221
Jackie,
you're so full of shit.

12:12.321 --> 12:14.765
Sara, there's someone here
to see you.

12:14.865 --> 12:16.016
-Me?
-It's something about

12:16.116 --> 12:17.017
your kid.

12:17.117 --> 12:18.200
Come on.

12:22.248 --> 12:23.649
What? You never had a fight
with your kids?

12:23.749 --> 12:26.527
-Did you hit David?
-My son was acting up.

12:26.627 --> 12:28.279
Yeah, maybe I smacked him
on the bottom

12:28.379 --> 12:30.322
but no, I did not hit him.

12:30.422 --> 12:31.949
Did you grab him
or shake him?

12:32.049 --> 12:33.617
Oh, my, God.
I'm getting mad.

12:33.717 --> 12:34.618
You come here.

12:34.718 --> 12:35.828
You embarrass me at work

12:35.928 --> 12:37.163
because
I disciplined my boy?

12:37.263 --> 12:39.290
How did David
got the cut on his face?

12:39.390 --> 12:40.749
He fell!

12:40.849 --> 12:43.141
He tripped
and hit the coffee table.

12:45.145 --> 12:47.423
Oh, my, God, do you think
I did that to him?

12:47.523 --> 12:50.384
I will never do that
to one of my kids.

12:50.484 --> 12:53.429
Your son
is in the hospital now.

12:53.529 --> 12:55.097
He-- He's in--
He's in the hospital now?

12:55.197 --> 12:56.974
What hospital? Why?
Why is he in the hospital?

12:57.074 --> 12:59.185
-It's okay. Calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down!

12:59.285 --> 13:00.701
Where is my boy?

13:12.715 --> 13:14.200
Hey.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.910
I'm here now.

13:16.010 --> 13:17.745
I think we got a problem.

13:17.845 --> 13:19.288
I can't get a take
on the mother.

13:19.388 --> 13:21.290
She gets an okay report
at work.

13:21.390 --> 13:22.917
Her daughter was vague
about what happened.

13:23.017 --> 13:24.043
The neighbor had
some scary stories

13:24.143 --> 13:26.587
but he stunk of drink.

13:26.687 --> 13:28.214
But she does show signs
of a nasty temper.

13:28.314 --> 13:29.548
I'm just afraid she might

13:29.648 --> 13:31.189
blame the boy
for all of this now.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.137
My gut says
it might be wise

13:35.237 --> 13:36.680
to place the kids
with a relative overnight

13:36.780 --> 13:38.182
until we can do
a complete background check

13:38.282 --> 13:40.365
and evaluate
the situation.

13:42.745 --> 13:44.453
Better safe than sorry.

13:46.081 --> 13:47.650
-Lord, you scared me.
-Where is David?

13:47.750 --> 13:49.666
I'm sorry,
let me call you back.

13:52.254 --> 13:54.114
I don't speak Spanish.
And you are?

13:54.214 --> 13:55.741
I'm Sara Diaz,
David's mother.

13:55.841 --> 13:57.243
-Sit down, Sara.
-No, I don't wanna sit down.

13:57.343 --> 13:59.620
-Where is he?
-Settle down, Sara.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.164
I'm on your side.

14:02.264 --> 14:03.916
Here,

14:04.016 --> 14:05.709
read this.

14:05.809 --> 14:08.101
There'll be one of these
at your apartment.

14:10.439 --> 14:12.549
They took Tia, too?

14:12.649 --> 14:14.468
What the hell?
I didn't do nothing.

14:14.568 --> 14:17.429
-Go down to the courthouse.
-They must be so scared.

14:17.529 --> 14:19.321
Go down there.
They'll help you.

14:29.666 --> 14:32.042
Hey, what's going on?
Where have you been?

14:36.965 --> 14:39.285
-Who took your kids away?
-I don't know. The court.

14:39.385 --> 14:41.912
Some mix-up about
a cut in David's eye.

14:42.012 --> 14:43.956
Ay, niña.

14:44.056 --> 14:46.139
Did you get your problem
sorted out, Sara?

15:23.387 --> 15:24.413
 Sofia Martinez's mother

15:24.513 --> 15:25.664
was found last night

15:25.764 --> 15:27.207
at a crack den
in The Bronx

15:27.307 --> 15:29.877
and immediately
taken into police custody.

15:29.977 --> 15:31.545
Sources tell me that
Rosie Martinez

15:31.645 --> 15:33.255
has told authorities--

15:33.355 --> 15:35.174
Believe the girl's
biological mother

15:35.274 --> 15:36.982
was caring for Sofia...

16:22.154 --> 16:25.307
-Hey.
-Oh, Martha!

16:25.407 --> 16:26.517
Hey.

16:26.617 --> 16:28.811
Oh. It's been ages.
Hey.

16:28.911 --> 16:29.978
What brings you
to this part of town?

16:30.078 --> 16:31.480
I thought
Park Avenue lawyers

16:31.580 --> 16:32.981
didn't have to come south
of 42nd Street?

16:33.081 --> 16:34.441
Oh, I know it's hard
for you to believe,

16:34.541 --> 16:36.235
but I actually have to be
in courtroom today.

16:36.335 --> 16:37.986
Oh, well,
that will keep you humble.

16:38.086 --> 16:39.738
-I miss you.
-Huh.

16:39.838 --> 16:41.365
We have to get together
with our spouses for dinner.

16:41.465 --> 16:43.450
-It's been way too long.
-Yeah, I would love that.

16:43.550 --> 16:45.035
-Have you been okay?
-Yeah, things are fantastic.

16:45.135 --> 16:46.120
-Okay.
-I'm gonna email you.

16:46.220 --> 16:48.720
-Sure. Okay. Yup.
-Bye.

16:59.608 --> 17:00.941
Next. Let's go.

17:03.403 --> 17:05.111
Excuse me.

17:07.699 --> 17:08.949
How are you?

17:13.747 --> 17:15.273
-Sorry I'm late.
-So am I. You're on.

17:15.374 --> 17:16.775
-What?
-Ruthie's sick.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.068
She's gonna be out
for a couple of days

17:18.167 --> 17:19.736
and I have two people
on vacation.

17:19.836 --> 17:21.738
You'll do intake.
The files are on your desk.

17:21.838 --> 17:23.281
I've never done
that before.

17:23.382 --> 17:25.867
You passed the bar.
You've watched Ruthie.

17:25.968 --> 17:27.759
You gotta start
some time.

17:35.644 --> 17:37.129
Good morning.

17:37.229 --> 17:38.839
Did I miss
the kaffeeklatsch?

17:38.939 --> 17:41.049
We're talking about
the Martinez case.

17:41.149 --> 17:42.968
It was mine.

17:43.068 --> 17:46.096
Oh, I didn't know.
I was away yesterday.

17:46.196 --> 17:47.639
I'm so sorry.

17:47.739 --> 17:48.932
I released the child back

17:49.032 --> 17:51.435
to the mother
three months ago.

17:51.535 --> 17:53.270
She was clean.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.063
I'm sure you did the right thing

17:55.163 --> 17:57.024
-in the case, Mark.
-That's what we always say.

17:57.124 --> 17:58.692
Well, we always say
because it's true.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.625
It's ACS's job to monitor.

18:02.379 --> 18:03.503
Yeah.

18:05.482 --> 18:07.007
I better get in there.

18:36.663 --> 18:38.705
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18:47.591 --> 18:50.008
Let the games begin.

19:00.103 --> 19:01.922
Sara Diaz.

19:02.422 --> 19:03.699
Hi, Alexandra Fisher,

19:03.799 --> 19:05.008
I'm gonna be your lawyer today.

19:05.108 --> 19:06.802
Okay. Let's see what we have.

19:06.902 --> 19:08.220
So, your children were removed

19:08.320 --> 19:11.382
-from your home due to--
-Sara Diaz.

19:11.582 --> 19:12.947
You got to be kidding me.

19:21.917 --> 19:23.443
Case number one on the calendar

19:23.543 --> 19:25.238
in the matter of Sara Diaz.

19:26.338 --> 19:28.031
Raise your right hand.

19:28.131 --> 19:29.666
Do you swear to tell the truth?

19:29.866 --> 19:30.951
Yes.

19:31.051 --> 19:32.160
Please sit.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.080
Good morning, Ms. Diaz.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.664
Good morning.

19:35.764 --> 19:37.207
And this is your attorney?

19:37.307 --> 19:38.458
-Yes, Your Honor.
-And you would be?

19:38.558 --> 19:39.668
Alexandra Fisher,
Your Honor.

19:39.768 --> 19:41.211
I'm from the 18B office.

19:41.311 --> 19:43.360
A fresh new face
in the halls of justice.

19:43.460 --> 19:44.464
Lovely to meet you.

19:44.564 --> 19:46.758
You could sit.

19:46.858 --> 19:48.510
Now, Ms. Diaz,
you are aware of the claims

19:48.610 --> 19:50.637
being brought against you today?

19:50.737 --> 19:52.889
Yes and I'm not guilty
of anything, ma'am.

19:52.989 --> 19:55.183
This is not a trial, Ms. Diaz.

19:55.283 --> 19:56.310
This is just an intake procedure

19:56.410 --> 19:57.728
to put forth a claim

19:57.828 --> 20:00.856
from the agency
for children services.

20:00.956 --> 20:02.608
I didn't do anything to my boy.

20:02.708 --> 20:04.067
You'll be able to tell
your side of the story

20:04.167 --> 20:06.737
in a stand of court procedure, okay?

20:06.837 --> 20:08.962
I just want them home today.

20:10.966 --> 20:13.201
I certainly understand that
and we will do what we can

20:13.301 --> 20:14.745
to make that happen.

20:14.845 --> 20:16.580
Mr. Sanjuro,
where are the children now?

20:16.680 --> 20:17.789
They're in the custody
of ACS, Your Honor.

20:17.889 --> 20:19.458
All right.

20:19.558 --> 20:21.877
Ms. Diaz,
who is the children's father?

20:21.977 --> 20:23.545
He's dead.

20:23.645 --> 20:24.630
I'm sorry.

20:24.730 --> 20:25.714
So, you have no relatives

20:25.814 --> 20:27.507
to place
the children with?

20:27.607 --> 20:30.510
No, well, my mother
doesn't live in this country.

20:30.610 --> 20:31.970
I don't understand
why my children

20:32.070 --> 20:33.347
were taken from me.

20:33.447 --> 20:35.307
Well, there have been
allegations

20:35.407 --> 20:38.268
-of you striking your son.
-Well, I didn't.

20:38.368 --> 20:39.895
My children
have been kidnapped.

20:39.995 --> 20:41.438
They must be very scared.

20:41.538 --> 20:42.898
-I want them home today.
-Hold on, Ms. Diaz.

20:42.998 --> 20:44.358
The court takes these charges
very seriously.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.109
Ms. Fisher,
you might wanna help

20:46.209 --> 20:47.694
-your client out here?
-Yes, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

20:47.794 --> 20:48.945
I was assigned to Ms. Diaz

20:49.045 --> 20:50.572
seconds before
we were called in,

20:50.672 --> 20:51.990
-so I haven't had a chance--
-I understand.

20:52.090 --> 20:53.283
Ms. Diaz, have you seen
your children

20:53.383 --> 20:55.369
-since they were taken?
-No.

20:55.469 --> 20:57.829
- Mr. Denholz, why is that?

20:57.929 --> 20:59.998
Your Honor, by the time
the school reported

21:00.098 --> 21:01.416
David's condition,
it was too late

21:01.516 --> 21:03.377
to file a petition.

21:03.477 --> 21:04.836
So, they kept him overnight
for observation

21:04.936 --> 21:06.505
in Atlantic Hospital.

21:06.605 --> 21:08.882
- He suffered a concussion--
-A concussion?

21:08.982 --> 21:10.342
Nobody told me
he had a concussion.

21:10.442 --> 21:12.135
It seems to be minor.

21:12.235 --> 21:13.679
-Where's the boy now?
-Now, he's back in school

21:13.779 --> 21:14.763
-with her sister.
-Back in school

21:14.863 --> 21:16.348
with a concussion?

21:16.448 --> 21:17.974
-Is that wise? Yes.
-If I may, Your Honor?

21:18.074 --> 21:19.851
The doctor felt that
if David woke up

21:19.951 --> 21:21.770
and had no complaints,
 he'd be fine to attend school.

21:21.870 --> 21:23.980
Has the agency had any
of other previous contact

21:24.080 --> 21:25.399
with the respondent?

21:25.499 --> 21:27.609
No, Your Honor,
but ACS does not recommend

21:27.709 --> 21:29.778
the return of children
without a formal hearing.

21:29.878 --> 21:31.571
And Ms. Diaz,

21:31.671 --> 21:33.699
you have the right
to ask for a hearing

21:33.799 --> 21:34.950
to determine
whether you pose

21:35.050 --> 21:36.827
an imminent risk
to your children.

21:36.927 --> 21:38.510
Would you like
to request that now?

21:41.515 --> 21:42.624
-I guess.
-No, you can't guess.

21:42.724 --> 21:45.669
-We need a yes or a no.
-Yes.

21:45.769 --> 21:47.796
Are you saying
I can't get them back now?

21:47.896 --> 21:49.005
I'm sorry, Ms. Diaz.

21:49.105 --> 21:50.507
I will arrange for you
to see

21:50.607 --> 21:52.426
your children today
and every day thereafter

21:52.526 --> 21:53.927
 -until the hearing, all right?
-No, no, no, no,

21:54.027 --> 21:55.512
-it's not all right.
-Ms. Diaz,

21:55.612 --> 21:57.556
the court does not like
to take children away

21:57.656 --> 21:58.849
from their parents.

21:58.949 --> 22:00.267
Now, you could spend
as much time

22:00.367 --> 22:01.476
with them as you like.

22:01.576 --> 22:03.645
Please note that,
Mr. Denholz.

22:03.745 --> 22:06.648
Your Honor, if I may?

22:06.748 --> 22:08.150
The agency would also like
to request

22:08.250 --> 22:10.277
that these visitations
be monitored.

22:10.377 --> 22:11.695
The children are
11 and eight,

22:11.795 --> 22:13.071
Ms. Diaz has
had no prior record

22:13.171 --> 22:15.073
with her agency.

22:15.173 --> 22:16.908
Your Honor, I think that
it will be prudent

22:17.008 --> 22:19.369
to exercise caution here.

22:19.469 --> 22:21.594
Do you have a job,
Ms. Diaz?

22:23.390 --> 22:25.667
-Ms. Diaz?
-Yes, ma'am.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.920
All right, let's get
our books out, shall we?

22:29.020 --> 22:30.464
What's good for you,
morning or afternoon,

22:30.564 --> 22:32.382
Ms. Diaz?

22:32.482 --> 22:33.842
Well, I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

22:33.942 --> 22:35.177
I'll have
to take time off.

22:35.277 --> 22:36.678
All right.

22:36.778 --> 22:39.055
What about 3:00 p.m.
on Monday?

22:39.155 --> 22:41.349
I have an opening
in my docket.

22:41.449 --> 22:42.809
That way,
I can hear the case

22:42.909 --> 22:44.144
and that should speed
things along.

22:44.244 --> 22:45.395
Your Honor,

22:45.495 --> 22:46.772
we'd ask that
the respondent

22:46.872 --> 22:49.566
-submit to a drug test today.
-Why?

22:49.666 --> 22:50.817
We make this request,
Your Honor,

22:50.917 --> 22:52.819
in the interest of time
with the weekend

22:52.919 --> 22:54.404
-coming up--
-All right.

22:54.504 --> 22:56.406
Ms. Diaz,
you're being asked to submit

22:56.506 --> 22:58.074
to a standard test
for drugs.

22:58.174 --> 23:00.118
Now, this is something
you do not have to do,

23:00.218 --> 23:02.621
but your attorney
might recommend it.

23:02.721 --> 23:04.456
Also, in family court,
your children

23:04.556 --> 23:06.291
get their own
legal representatives,

23:06.391 --> 23:10.128
so someone from legal aid
will meet with David and Tia.

23:10.228 --> 23:12.047
Now,
if there's nothing else,

23:12.147 --> 23:13.256
I'll see you on Monday.

23:13.356 --> 23:14.689
Clear the court.

23:17.027 --> 23:18.261
How was the college,
Judge?

23:18.361 --> 23:20.972
- Joe, it was very white.

23:21.072 --> 23:22.432
Did Elliot
like his roommate?

23:22.532 --> 23:23.767
He seemed like it,
you know.

23:23.867 --> 23:25.227
He's from California.

23:25.327 --> 23:28.980
His mother dresses
like Malibu Barbie.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.526
Wearing spandex at 50.

23:32.626 --> 23:35.487
All right,
we'll get to the next case.

23:35.587 --> 23:37.113
Please come in.
Have a seat.

23:37.213 --> 23:38.824
I'm fine.

23:38.924 --> 23:40.408
Okay.

23:40.508 --> 23:42.160
We'll only have
a few minutes now,

23:42.260 --> 23:43.870
so we should plan again
together either later today

23:43.970 --> 23:45.038
or first thing
Monday morning.

23:45.138 --> 23:46.706
You're my lawyer?

23:46.806 --> 23:48.208
-Yes.
-You don't look old enough

23:48.308 --> 23:49.918
to be a lawyer.

23:50.018 --> 23:52.629
Is that why
I don't have to pay you?

23:52.729 --> 23:54.047
No.

23:54.147 --> 23:55.841
I'm actually a graduate
of the law.

23:55.941 --> 23:57.551
Do you think
this is funny?

23:57.651 --> 23:58.718
I don't care
where you went to school.

23:58.818 --> 24:00.929
I just want my kids back.

24:01.029 --> 24:02.931
Yes, I understand.

24:03.031 --> 24:05.392
Now, this issue
of the drug test.

24:05.492 --> 24:07.435
-What is that?
-Just a urine sample,

24:07.535 --> 24:09.354
make sure you're not
on heroin or crack.

24:09.454 --> 24:11.064
My God, no.
I'm not an addict, of course.

24:11.164 --> 24:12.566
Okay. Then I would just take
the test.

24:12.666 --> 24:13.942
-Okay.
-Now, have you ever been

24:14.042 --> 24:15.416
-convicted of a crime?
-No.

24:17.462 --> 24:20.532
-They need you back inside.
-I have to run.

24:20.632 --> 24:22.158
Well, when do I see
my kids?

24:22.258 --> 24:23.535
If you can just hang around
for a little bit,

24:23.635 --> 24:25.495
I can have that information
to you by lunch.

24:25.595 --> 24:26.997
It's nice working
with you.

24:27.097 --> 24:28.206
What's your name?

24:28.306 --> 24:31.376
Oh, sorry.
Alexandra Fisher.

24:31.476 --> 24:33.879
Call me Ally.

24:33.979 --> 24:35.895
And do you know my name?

24:37.857 --> 24:40.010
Ms. Diaz,

24:40.110 --> 24:42.596
Sara.

24:42.696 --> 24:45.196
I'll see you later, Sara.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.351
Did you talk to them?

24:48.451 --> 24:49.519
Yeah.

24:49.619 --> 24:51.646
-Why?
-Because I had to.

24:51.746 --> 24:53.815
-What did you say?
-I didn't say nothing.

24:53.915 --> 24:54.983
Well, you had to have
said something.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.526
Stop blaming, David.

24:56.626 --> 24:59.195
You're the reason
we're here!

24:59.295 --> 25:00.196
Tia,

25:00.296 --> 25:01.740
David?

25:01.840 --> 25:03.325
-Mommy.
-Hi, baby.

25:03.425 --> 25:05.827
-Mommy.
-Hi, baby.

25:05.927 --> 25:07.871
Hi, hey, you don't have
a hug for me?

25:07.971 --> 25:09.289
Come on!

25:09.389 --> 25:12.709
Hi, my big boy.

25:12.809 --> 25:15.962
-Mommy, look at the toys.
-Let's see them.

25:16.062 --> 25:17.923
They're so beautiful.

25:18.023 --> 25:19.466
Hey, Davey,

25:19.566 --> 25:20.842
how are you feeling?

25:20.942 --> 25:22.761
-Does it hurt?
-I'm okay.

25:22.861 --> 25:23.929
They said I have
a concussion,

25:24.029 --> 25:25.263
but I'm fine.

25:25.363 --> 25:26.973
Why didn't
you say something?

25:27.073 --> 25:28.516
Why did you go to school
feeling sick?

25:28.616 --> 25:29.726
I felt okay
when I woke up.

25:29.826 --> 25:31.770
-Did I do something wrong?
-No, no.

25:31.870 --> 25:33.563
It's just...

25:33.663 --> 25:35.857
It's just
a big misunderstanding.

25:35.957 --> 25:37.525
Have you guys been eating?

25:37.625 --> 25:39.736
Well, they have
chicken fingers.

25:39.836 --> 25:42.030
Those are your favorite.

25:42.130 --> 25:43.713
Yeah, I guess.

25:45.050 --> 25:46.924
Have you been eating,
Davey?

25:48.845 --> 25:51.498
You eat something
on every meal, you hear me?

25:51.598 --> 25:53.333
Yes.

25:53.433 --> 25:55.224
Can we go home now?

25:58.063 --> 25:59.839
No, Tia.

25:59.939 --> 26:02.217
 They say you have to stay here
a couple more nights.

26:02.317 --> 26:03.385
-I don't want to.
-I know.

26:03.485 --> 26:04.803
I don't want it either.

26:04.903 --> 26:06.513
I'll get everything fixed
on Monday

26:06.613 --> 26:08.098
and then you'll be home
like always.

26:08.198 --> 26:11.935
-But I wanna come home now.
-No, Tia, no tears.

26:12.035 --> 26:13.770
We gotta be strong here
because there's nothing

26:13.870 --> 26:16.398
we can do about it.

26:16.498 --> 26:19.275
You'll be good.

26:19.375 --> 26:22.320
Davey, you stay with her.

26:22.420 --> 26:23.628
You take care
of your sister.

26:27.634 --> 26:29.592
They've been asking me
all kinds of questions.

26:31.262 --> 26:32.706
-I bet they have.
-What should I say?

26:32.806 --> 26:34.499
Baby, tell them the truth.

26:34.599 --> 26:36.292
Tell them you wanna come home
with me.

26:36.392 --> 26:37.502
Mrs. Diaz,

26:37.602 --> 26:38.962
we need to get
Tia and David

26:39.062 --> 26:40.005
to dinner now.

26:40.105 --> 26:41.589
But I just got here.

26:41.689 --> 26:42.799
It's time.

26:42.899 --> 26:44.175
Put away your toys.

26:44.275 --> 26:46.511
Boys, follow me.

26:46.611 --> 26:48.694
We'll meet you
at the door.

26:51.449 --> 26:53.727
Some kind of adventure
you're having, huh?

26:53.827 --> 26:55.159
I don't want
an adventure.

26:57.705 --> 26:59.107
So, is Elliot loving school?

26:59.207 --> 27:01.359
Oh, well, so far so good.

27:01.459 --> 27:03.403
We'll see how it goes.

27:03.503 --> 27:04.988
I bet
you cried your eyes out

27:05.088 --> 27:06.906
with your only one
going off to college.

27:07.006 --> 27:08.700
-Well...
-She did.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.327
You did.

27:11.227 --> 27:13.321
I was a wreck
when Sally went off.

27:13.421 --> 27:14.862
But you still have Caroline
at home.

27:15.482 --> 27:17.000
No,
she's at Milton this year.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.293
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:18.393 --> 27:19.597
Boy, we have been out of touch.

27:19.707 --> 27:20.712
Well, here's
to an empty nest.

27:20.812 --> 27:22.837
- Hmm, yes.
--Cheers.

27:25.475 --> 27:27.510
Your cosmo matches
your beautiful dress.

27:27.610 --> 27:29.629
Oh, I guess.

27:29.829 --> 27:30.981
Drew.

27:31.281 --> 27:32.849
Catch us up on corporate law.

27:32.949 --> 27:34.100
You don't miss working
in corporate law,

27:34.200 --> 27:35.435
do you, Martha?

27:35.535 --> 27:36.978
No,
but I do miss the money.

27:37.078 --> 27:38.813
That is so funny.
So do I.

27:38.913 --> 27:41.316
What a coincidence.

27:41.416 --> 27:43.193
You know what,
I think we should order

27:43.293 --> 27:45.153
for the table because
if I drink too many

27:45.253 --> 27:46.905
of these cosmos,
I'm gonna be on the floor.

27:47.005 --> 27:48.698
I love the lamp here.

27:48.798 --> 27:50.408
-Lamp?
-Lamb!

27:50.508 --> 27:51.826
She's having a lamp?

27:51.926 --> 27:54.913
Lamb.

27:55.013 --> 27:57.248
-They can't blame you, Luis.
-That's how it works.

27:57.348 --> 27:58.458
But you weren't
the only one on the case.

27:58.558 --> 28:00.085
But I was in charge.

28:00.185 --> 28:01.503
We're the one
whose heads are gonna roll.

28:01.603 --> 28:02.754
There's plenty of blame
to go around.

28:02.854 --> 28:04.756
Or the mother,
where was she then?

28:04.856 --> 28:07.717
I can't remember
very much.

28:07.817 --> 28:08.843
You know how many cases
I'm in charge of?

28:08.943 --> 28:10.470
I'm sorry.

28:10.570 --> 28:11.721
I mean, the apartment
was in order.

28:11.821 --> 28:13.807
The kitchen
was full of food.

28:13.907 --> 28:15.391
Dante, please

28:15.491 --> 28:18.117
stop biting
or we're going home.

28:33.968 --> 28:36.412
 Luis.

28:36.512 --> 28:37.789
Luis,

28:37.889 --> 28:41.251
we wanna go get
ice cream now.

28:41.351 --> 28:46.172
Okay. I... I really have
to get back to work.

28:46.272 --> 28:48.174
Jesus, Luis,
we just got here.

28:48.274 --> 28:49.342
I know.

28:49.442 --> 28:51.261
We never get to see you
anymore.

28:51.361 --> 28:53.304
I have to prepare
for the hearing

28:53.404 --> 28:55.154
and
they're gonna grill me.

28:56.658 --> 28:57.990
I'm sorry.

28:59.744 --> 29:01.494
It's gonna be all right.

29:07.835 --> 29:09.445
Come here. Bye-bye.

29:09.545 --> 29:10.780
Listen to Mama, okay?

29:10.880 --> 29:13.172
Be good, behave.

29:56.134 --> 29:57.785
Hi.

29:57.885 --> 29:59.552
Good to see you.

30:05.226 --> 30:06.711
Aunt Ally!

30:06.811 --> 30:08.254
Emily!

30:08.354 --> 30:10.089
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

30:10.189 --> 30:11.216
Come see what I made.

30:11.316 --> 30:12.884
-Hey, Sis.
-Come on.

30:12.984 --> 30:13.968
What'd you make?

30:14.068 --> 30:15.678
I made the place cards.

30:15.778 --> 30:18.264
You did not?
Those are so cool.

30:18.364 --> 30:20.475
-There you are, darling.
-Hi, Mom.

30:20.575 --> 30:22.644
You're a little
casually dressed.

30:22.744 --> 30:25.605
-It's Sunday brunch.
-You know Grandma.

30:25.705 --> 30:27.398
She still thinks she's
in an Edith Wharton novel.

30:27.498 --> 30:28.691
I know she does.

30:28.791 --> 30:29.817
Can I go up to the den?

30:29.917 --> 30:32.111
Of course you can,
sweetheart.

30:32.211 --> 30:34.197
Just make sure you go
with your daddy, okay?

30:34.297 --> 30:35.615
Come on,
we got to be quick.

30:35.715 --> 30:36.950
Brunch is gonna be
ready soon.

30:37.050 --> 30:38.409
Your grandmother
is really happy

30:38.509 --> 30:40.328
you're able to join us.

30:40.428 --> 30:42.080
Sweetie, you okay?
You look a little tired.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.665
I'm fine.

30:43.765 --> 30:46.042
Just had a long night.

30:46.142 --> 30:47.669
Maybe it'll help you
remember the names of them.

30:47.769 --> 30:49.837
Ah, there's my girl.

30:49.937 --> 30:52.063
-Hello, Al.
-Hi, Dad.

30:53.399 --> 30:54.467
Happy birthday, Gram.

30:54.567 --> 30:55.843
Oh, thank you, dear.

30:55.943 --> 30:57.929
I'm so glad
you could make it.

30:58.029 --> 30:59.806
You know, our birthday's
only good for one thing

30:59.906 --> 31:01.599
at this stage.

31:01.699 --> 31:04.894
It's a great excuse
to bring everyone together.

31:04.994 --> 31:07.313
-There are the Roths.
-Oh, wonderful.

31:07.413 --> 31:08.648
Where's Adele?

31:08.748 --> 31:10.692
Go take their coats,
will you, dear?

31:10.792 --> 31:12.318
Of course, Mother.

31:12.418 --> 31:13.945
I do everything
you ever tell me to do.

31:14.045 --> 31:16.045
No, you don't,
but you should.

31:17.465 --> 31:18.866
Come, sit.

31:18.966 --> 31:20.493
Talk to me.

31:20.593 --> 31:22.620
I never get to see you.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.164
Well,
you're seeing me now.

31:25.264 --> 31:27.917
Well, we could have a meal
together, you know.

31:28.017 --> 31:30.128
Just the two of us.

31:30.228 --> 31:31.629
Okay.

31:31.729 --> 31:33.062
I've been really busy.

31:34.816 --> 31:37.552
I'm glad that you
didn't go into the firm

31:37.652 --> 31:38.970
right from school.

31:39.070 --> 31:40.471
I thought that's what

31:40.571 --> 31:41.931
you would've wanted me to do,
no?

31:42.031 --> 31:43.433
No, I like the fact

31:43.533 --> 31:44.517
that you're doing
something good

31:44.617 --> 31:45.727
for the world.

31:45.827 --> 31:47.437
Thank you.

31:47.537 --> 31:49.939
It's been a challenge
for sure.

31:50.039 --> 31:51.649
Hmm, I'll bet.

31:51.749 --> 31:54.193
They're probably
paying you a song.

31:54.293 --> 31:58.364
That's what trust funds
are for, I suppose.

31:58.464 --> 32:00.116
Aren't you glad
your grandfather

32:00.216 --> 32:02.118
thought of that?

32:02.218 --> 32:03.968
Yeah.

32:05.680 --> 32:08.333
Thank you
for coming today.

32:08.433 --> 32:10.710
It means a lot.

32:10.810 --> 32:14.088
Of course.

32:14.188 --> 32:16.215
Whatever happened
to that young man

32:16.315 --> 32:18.968
-you were dating?
-Oh, I'm not sure.

32:19.068 --> 32:20.803
That was over at the end
of law school, so.

32:20.903 --> 32:22.388
Oh.

32:22.488 --> 32:24.182
Are you seeing
anyone now?

32:24.282 --> 32:26.225
No. Not at the moment.

32:26.325 --> 32:28.936
Well, don't let
too much time pass.

32:29.036 --> 32:30.313
I'm 25.

32:30.413 --> 32:33.316
Of course.

32:33.416 --> 32:35.318
Just don't be lonely,
that's all I meant.

32:35.418 --> 32:36.944
You know what,
if I get too lonely,

32:37.044 --> 32:39.503
there's always the bar
at the end of my block.

32:43.342 --> 32:45.328
Hmm.

32:45.428 --> 32:48.039
I think you want me
to change the subject,

32:48.139 --> 32:49.513
so I shall.

32:59.567 --> 33:02.512
Well, it looks like
everybody's here.

33:02.612 --> 33:04.889
Would you go round up
the folks into the den?

33:04.989 --> 33:07.907
Yes, gladly.

33:12.914 --> 33:14.399
...but the giraffe
was going,

33:14.499 --> 33:16.359
"Oh, no, I thought
the elephants were,

33:16.459 --> 33:18.986
but the elephants
don't socialize.

33:19.086 --> 33:20.613
-I think"--
-It's time to eat.

33:20.713 --> 33:21.864
Not the elephants.

33:21.964 --> 33:24.158
But I wanna finish
the story.

33:24.258 --> 33:25.868
Go downstairs, Emily.

33:25.968 --> 33:27.328
-But we're on the middle--
-Come on. Come on.

33:27.428 --> 33:28.663
But we're in the middle
of the story.

33:28.763 --> 33:29.831
It's time to eat,
I don't care,

33:29.931 --> 33:32.041
don't argue with me, go.

33:32.141 --> 33:34.752
Mommy!

33:34.852 --> 33:36.712
I don't wanna see you alone
with that child again,

33:36.812 --> 33:38.789
-you got me?
-I resent your implication.

33:38.889 --> 33:40.908
You are in no position
to resent anything.

33:41.008 --> 33:42.844
You have an active imagination.

33:43.044 --> 33:45.612
We know this has nothing to do
with my imagination.

33:45.812 --> 33:47.666
Is everything all right?

33:48.366 --> 33:50.409
I don't know, is everything
all right, Uncle Frank?

33:50.509 --> 33:52.042
Everything's fine.

33:55.623 --> 33:57.608
What was that all about?

33:57.708 --> 33:59.944
Nothing, just go downstairs and eat.

34:00.044 --> 34:02.044
I just need a minute, okay?

34:17.395 --> 34:19.130
Elaine Dunbar
of the Legal Aid Society

34:19.230 --> 34:20.922
for David and Tia Diaz.

34:21.023 --> 34:23.467
Luis Sanjuro for the Agency
for Children Services.

34:23.568 --> 34:26.762
Keith Denholz
for the Corporation Council.

34:26.862 --> 34:29.056
Alexandra Fisher for the respondent.

34:29.156 --> 34:32.685
Ms. Diaz, would you please
state your name for the record?

34:32.985 --> 34:35.563
I'm Sara Diaz,

34:36.063 --> 34:37.214
for my kids.

34:37.313 --> 34:38.674
Raise your right hand.

34:38.774 --> 34:39.958
Do you swear to tell the truth?

34:40.058 --> 34:42.011
- Yes.
--Thank you.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.219
Now you may sit.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.889
We are here today to determine

34:45.989 --> 34:49.101
whether Ms. Diaz
poses an imminent risk

34:49.201 --> 34:50.728
to her children, first Ms. Diaz,

34:50.828 --> 34:52.521
have you seen your children?

34:52.621 --> 34:54.356
Yes, ma'am, every day.

34:54.456 --> 34:55.733
Good.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.401
And how did you find the children?

34:57.501 --> 34:59.028
David seems to be on the mend,

34:59.128 --> 35:01.005
the children were very pleased
to see their mother

35:01.105 --> 35:03.324
and they're very anxious
to be returned home.

35:03.424 --> 35:05.192
Very good. Mr. Sanjuro?

35:05.292 --> 35:07.653
Yes, the children
do want to return home

35:07.753 --> 35:09.780
but Your Honor,
I would like to draw

35:09.880 --> 35:11.782
your attention
to this report here.

35:11.882 --> 35:13.158
As you will see,

35:13.258 --> 35:15.052
Ms. Diaz did take a voluntary drug test

35:15.152 --> 35:17.195
but the results indicate

35:17.295 --> 35:19.949
signs of marijuana use and PCP.

35:20.049 --> 35:21.783
-What?
-Your Honor,

35:21.883 --> 35:24.391
we would also like to have
a copy of those results?

35:25.671 --> 35:27.322
I'm sorry,
this just came in now.

35:27.422 --> 35:28.991
-Yeah, I'm sure it did.
-All right.

35:29.091 --> 35:30.642
Go on, Mr. Denholz.

35:30.742 --> 35:32.060
Furthermore, Your Honor,

35:32.160 --> 35:33.520
the respondent has a criminal record

35:33.620 --> 35:35.306
in regards to drug trafficking.

35:35.806 --> 35:37.967
That was over six years ago,
and the charges were dropped.

35:38.067 --> 35:40.678
Ms. Diaz, you'll have
an opportunity to respond.

35:40.778 --> 35:42.546
Indeed it would've been nice
to have had this

35:42.646 --> 35:44.139
in advance, Mr. Denholz.

35:44.239 --> 35:45.432
Well, I'm sorry,
Your Honor,

35:45.532 --> 35:47.184
over the lack of intakes and--

35:47.284 --> 35:49.344
-Ms. Fisher.
-Your Honor, as you know,

35:49.444 --> 35:51.045
we have just received these materials--

35:51.145 --> 35:52.352
They're nonsense, Your Honor.

35:52.473 --> 35:54.482
No, they are not nonsense, Ms. Diaz,

35:54.582 --> 35:56.652
and I'm reluctant to return children

35:56.752 --> 35:58.270
to a parent who's using drugs.

35:58.370 --> 36:00.447
What? No, no, no.
I just had a couple of puffs on a joint.

36:00.547 --> 36:02.116
I didn't know
it had anything in it.

36:02.216 --> 36:03.325
And she told me the drug test

36:03.425 --> 36:04.869
was gonna be for heroin or crack

36:04.969 --> 36:06.328
-and of course I'm--
-Hold on, Ms. Diaz,

36:06.428 --> 36:07.746
this is a conversation
you should be having

36:07.846 --> 36:08.956
with your attorney in private.

36:09.056 --> 36:10.541
Your Honor, if I can just have

36:10.641 --> 36:12.042
-a second with my client.
-I trust you understand

36:12.142 --> 36:13.669
how many cases
we have backed up today.

36:13.769 --> 36:15.337
I do, I do.

36:15.437 --> 36:16.672
Please, let me handle this.

36:16.772 --> 36:18.299
You're doing more harm than good.

36:18.399 --> 36:19.717
Why didn't you tell me
they were testing

36:19.817 --> 36:21.135
-for marijuana?
-We can discuss that later,

36:21.235 --> 36:22.261
just please let me handle this.

36:22.361 --> 36:24.305
I want my kids home, tonight.

36:24.405 --> 36:25.723
Don't lose your cool, okay?

36:25.823 --> 36:27.906
The judge is starting
to turn on you.

36:29.694 --> 36:32.638
Your Honor, at first glance,

36:32.738 --> 36:34.640
this drug test
only indicates minor traces

36:34.740 --> 36:36.309
of both marijuana and PCP,

36:36.409 --> 36:38.936
certainly nothing
that indicates long-term use.

36:39.036 --> 36:40.229
The arrest record
is almost a decade old

36:40.329 --> 36:42.440
and the conviction
was overturned.

36:42.540 --> 36:45.943
As you know, my client
has no history with ACS,

36:46.043 --> 36:47.320
and the children's attorney
testified

36:47.420 --> 36:49.280
that David and Tia
want to return home.

36:49.380 --> 36:50.698
I see no reason why
their wish shouldn't be

36:50.798 --> 36:51.866
granted at this time.

36:51.966 --> 36:53.618
Mr. Denholz?

36:53.718 --> 36:54.952
Judge,

36:55.052 --> 36:56.579
we have a boy here
who suffered

36:56.679 --> 36:58.414
from facial lacerations
and a concussion,

36:58.514 --> 36:59.790
all indications

36:59.890 --> 37:01.584
are that it was caused
by the mother.

37:01.684 --> 37:03.961
That, in conjunction
with the original report

37:04.061 --> 37:05.087
from the neighbor,

37:05.187 --> 37:06.631
plus the medical information

37:06.731 --> 37:08.424
documenting
the child's injuries,

37:08.524 --> 37:10.676
we feel that
it is prudent

37:10.776 --> 37:12.219
that we keep custody
of the children

37:12.319 --> 37:14.138
until we do a more
extensive background check.

37:14.238 --> 37:15.848
No, my kids
wants to come home!

37:15.948 --> 37:16.974
I'm not an addict,
I'm a good mother.

37:17.074 --> 37:18.184
Sit down, Ms. Diaz.

37:18.284 --> 37:19.560
Why do you keep
calling me miss?

37:19.660 --> 37:20.811
In my courtroom,
I address everyone

37:20.911 --> 37:23.356
by their last name,
now sit down!

37:23.456 --> 37:25.358
Ms. Fisher, if your client
has one outburst,

37:25.458 --> 37:26.442
I will remove her.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.485
I'm losing patience.

37:27.585 --> 37:29.626
I understand, Your Honor.

37:39.221 --> 37:40.790
Ms. Dunbar,
what is your position

37:40.890 --> 37:42.249
-on this issue?
-Your Honor,

37:42.349 --> 37:43.834
perhaps the children
may be returned home

37:43.934 --> 37:45.002
with supervision.

37:45.102 --> 37:46.212
Mr. Sanjuro,
can the children

37:46.312 --> 37:47.963
be returned home
with supervision?

37:48.063 --> 37:50.564
That will take our office
a few days to organize.

37:52.526 --> 37:53.886
Now,

37:53.986 --> 37:56.555
 would the respondent character
speak?

37:56.655 --> 37:58.572
Ms. Diaz.

38:06.665 --> 38:08.192
I got arrested
when I was young

38:08.292 --> 38:11.237
for doing something stupid,
I was completely set up.

38:11.337 --> 38:13.280
I'm a good mother.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.866
I got a job,
I'm not on welfare.

38:15.966 --> 38:17.451
I had an argument
with my kid

38:17.551 --> 38:19.745
because I was afraid
he was doing drugs,

38:19.845 --> 38:21.330
he disobeyed me

38:21.430 --> 38:23.639
and was hanging out
with the wrong crowd.

38:25.184 --> 38:26.725
I was just trying
to discipline him

38:28.604 --> 38:30.381
and maybe things got
a little bit out of hand,

38:30.481 --> 38:31.716
-I would not--
 -What do you mean when you say

38:31.816 --> 38:33.398
got a little out of hand?

38:36.028 --> 38:37.930
Well, I lost my temper
with my boy

38:38.030 --> 38:40.391
but that concussion
was an accident.

38:40.491 --> 38:41.642
An accident that resulted

38:41.742 --> 38:44.243
from an argument with you,
correct?

38:46.205 --> 38:47.704
Yeah, maybe.

38:50.251 --> 38:51.902
Ms. Diaz, excuse me,

38:52.002 --> 38:54.989
but that is how
I will address you.

38:55.089 --> 38:57.381
Would you say
that you have a temper?

39:00.386 --> 39:03.789
Yeah, I suppose.

39:03.889 --> 39:05.374
Sometimes.

39:05.474 --> 39:08.350
Yeah,
I suppose sometimes, too.

39:10.729 --> 39:14.425
Now, I very much want
David and Tia to return home.

39:14.525 --> 39:16.177
Mr. Sanjuro,

39:16.277 --> 39:17.762
can you arrange
for supervision

39:17.862 --> 39:20.931
for the Diaz household,
A.S.A.P?

39:21.031 --> 39:22.808
Ms. Diaz,

39:22.908 --> 39:26.076
I would like you to start
anger management counseling.

39:27.663 --> 39:29.913
Would you be open to that?

39:33.002 --> 39:34.570
-I guess.
-You guess?

39:34.670 --> 39:36.322
Look, I work
long hours as it is

39:36.422 --> 39:37.865
and I just want to see
my kids every day.

39:37.965 --> 39:39.116
Understood.

39:39.216 --> 39:40.451
Mr. Sanjuro
can work with you

39:40.551 --> 39:42.286
to find the time.

39:42.386 --> 39:44.580
I really think
it could be useful, Ms. Diaz.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.916
Okay.

39:47.016 --> 39:48.375
So...

39:48.475 --> 39:50.085
can I get
the kids back now?

39:50.185 --> 39:52.797
It'll take
at least two days

39:52.897 --> 39:55.063
before supervision
can be organized.

40:06.118 --> 40:07.200
Don't touch me.

40:14.209 --> 40:15.861
Your Honor-- Your Honor,

40:15.961 --> 40:17.780
I'm sorry,

40:17.880 --> 40:21.575
ACS is not allowed
by law to care

40:21.675 --> 40:23.369
for the children
for more than five nights.

40:23.469 --> 40:25.037
Let's see, the children

40:25.137 --> 40:27.206
-have been there for--
-This is the fifth night.

40:27.306 --> 40:28.666
Wouldn't it make sense
to keep them there

40:28.766 --> 40:31.001
until home supervision
is arranged in two days?

40:31.101 --> 40:32.586
These are the guidelines.

40:32.686 --> 40:33.921
Are you sure the supervision
could not be

40:34.021 --> 40:35.381
-sped along?
-Your Honor,

40:35.481 --> 40:39.426
-we are so understaff--
-Understaff, okay.

40:39.526 --> 40:41.303
Ms. Diaz, are you sure
there's no family

40:41.403 --> 40:42.694
in the area?

40:44.531 --> 40:46.198
No, ma'am.

40:51.121 --> 40:53.440
Mr. Sanjuro, please see
if you can arrange

40:53.540 --> 40:56.277
short-term foster care
for the children?

40:56.377 --> 40:58.195
Please keep them
as close to home and school

40:58.295 --> 41:00.573
as possible
and make certain

41:00.673 --> 41:03.325
that Ms. Diaz
has full-time access.

41:03.425 --> 41:05.578
Now, everyone take out
your books.

41:05.678 --> 41:08.831
Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.,

41:08.931 --> 41:11.375
-any objections?
-Your Honor, I have

41:11.475 --> 41:13.586
a departmental hearing
that day.

41:13.686 --> 41:15.560
The Martinez case.

41:17.272 --> 41:18.674
Okay.

41:18.774 --> 41:23.012
What about next Tuesday
at 3:00 p.m.?

41:23.112 --> 41:24.471
Hopefully,
we can formalize

41:24.571 --> 41:26.557
David and Tia's
return home

41:26.657 --> 41:28.142
and there will be
nothing but smiles

41:28.242 --> 41:30.019
at the end of the session.

41:30.119 --> 41:31.119
Thank you.

41:35.374 --> 41:36.609
You're a lousy lawyer.

41:36.709 --> 41:38.360
If you had just
sat there quietly

41:38.460 --> 41:39.653
-and let me do my job--
-Well, it's hard

41:39.753 --> 41:40.738
to sit quietly
when they're saying

41:40.838 --> 41:42.531
lies about you,

41:42.631 --> 41:44.965
when they're trying
to take your kids away.

41:46.760 --> 41:49.371
You don't have any kids,
right?

41:49.471 --> 41:51.081
Right.

41:51.181 --> 41:52.917
Why didn't you tell me
you were arrested?

41:53.017 --> 41:55.169
Why didn't you tell me
they were testing for pot?

41:55.269 --> 41:56.670
I can't help you
if you don't

41:56.770 --> 41:58.422
tell me these things.

41:58.522 --> 42:00.397
Okay? I need to know
about you, Sara.

42:02.026 --> 42:04.109
You're just a little
rich girl.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.279
You'll never know me.

42:08.866 --> 42:10.741
And I want another lawyer.

42:13.871 --> 42:15.481
We can get you
another lawyer

42:15.581 --> 42:18.400
but I think that would be
making a big mistake.

42:18.500 --> 42:21.320
I'm living a big mistake.

42:21.420 --> 42:25.741
I want another lawyer.

42:25.841 --> 42:27.242
Fine.

42:27.342 --> 42:29.176
We'll get you
another lawyer.

43:21.730 --> 43:23.424
Well, this is
all very mysterious.

43:23.524 --> 43:24.967
Sorry.

43:25.067 --> 43:27.511
I didn't know
where else to do this.

43:27.611 --> 43:29.304
You look terrible.

43:29.404 --> 43:30.848
What's going on?

43:30.948 --> 43:33.058
Nancy's having an affair.

43:33.158 --> 43:35.144
Oh, Lord.

43:35.244 --> 43:37.062
You're kidding.

43:37.162 --> 43:38.981
-No.
-I'm sorry, Drew.

43:39.081 --> 43:40.622
Yeah, so am I.

43:42.918 --> 43:44.793
Well, does this mean
the end of the marriage?

43:45.963 --> 43:47.337
Yeah, I think so.

43:50.634 --> 43:51.785
Don't be rash.

43:51.885 --> 43:52.870
She wouldn't be
the first spouse

43:52.970 --> 43:54.329
in the world
to fool around.

43:54.429 --> 43:55.789
-Martha.
-For me--

43:55.889 --> 43:57.514
Nancy is having an affair
with Jason.

44:00.561 --> 44:01.795
Did you hear me?

44:01.895 --> 44:04.104
Your husband
is screwing my wife.

44:06.525 --> 44:07.858
That's ridiculous.

44:09.444 --> 44:11.722
They're together
in Boston,

44:11.822 --> 44:13.321
today.

44:27.754 --> 44:29.323
Oh, hey.

44:29.923 --> 44:31.158
Hello.

44:31.258 --> 44:33.619
I missed the earlier shuttle.

44:33.719 --> 44:34.720
I didn't call.

44:34.820 --> 44:36.622
I thought you were gonna be
with your sister tonight?

44:36.722 --> 44:38.582
Yeah, I was.

44:38.682 --> 44:39.917
How was your trip?

44:40.017 --> 44:43.587
Okay, anything to eat
in the kitchen?

44:43.687 --> 44:45.478
Didn't you
and Nancy get dinner?

45:00.954 --> 45:03.565
-How did you--
-Drew.

45:03.665 --> 45:06.652
Poor guy is devastated.

45:06.752 --> 45:08.487
 Nancy shouldn't have forgotten
her cell phone,

45:08.587 --> 45:09.863
I would have thought
she would've covered

45:09.963 --> 45:11.323
her tracks better,
but then again,

45:11.423 --> 45:13.673
she's always been cunning
in sport.

45:19.514 --> 45:21.208
Well,

45:21.308 --> 45:23.669
say something.

45:23.769 --> 45:26.130
I didn't--

45:26.230 --> 45:28.063
I didn't expect this
to happen.

45:31.401 --> 45:32.803
I would never
wanna hurt you.

45:32.903 --> 45:35.430
Please spare me
that speech.

45:35.530 --> 45:37.224
Your clothes, or at least
what's left of them,

45:37.324 --> 45:39.601
are in the bedroom.

45:39.701 --> 45:41.812
-Can we talk about this?
-No.

45:41.912 --> 45:43.981
I'll be back in an hour
and I want you gone.

45:44.081 --> 45:45.440
I want you out
of this house.

45:45.540 --> 45:47.192
-Martha.
-Call Nancy.

45:47.292 --> 45:49.319
I'm sure Drew is throwing her
out tonight, too.

45:49.419 --> 45:51.613
-Martha, wait a second.
-Prick.

45:51.713 --> 45:53.448
You couldn't pick someone
out of my secretary,

45:53.548 --> 45:56.410
you have to screw one
of my oldest friends' wives?

45:56.510 --> 45:58.287
Is it a white bitch
what turns you on?

45:58.387 --> 45:59.413
Is that what
you really want?

45:59.513 --> 46:00.914
You would do this to me?

46:01.014 --> 46:02.541
You make me sick.

46:02.641 --> 46:05.308
You're a spineless fraud
and you disgust me.

46:56.069 --> 46:57.888
Hey.

46:57.988 --> 46:59.306
Hey.

46:59.406 --> 47:01.031
You live in here
these days or what?

47:02.993 --> 47:04.326
Feels like it.

47:06.038 --> 47:07.189
Mrs. Barnes said
she'll call you

47:07.289 --> 47:09.650
when they assign you
another lawyer.

47:09.750 --> 47:11.916
Yeah, well, she said that
three days ago.

47:14.212 --> 47:15.545
How are your kids doing?

47:17.507 --> 47:20.244
They're staying
with some old lady now.

47:20.344 --> 47:22.996
She seems nice enough
but there's, like, six kids

47:23.096 --> 47:24.081
in that house
and I just don't like

47:24.181 --> 47:25.791
the look of some of them.

47:25.891 --> 47:27.542
Really? There shouldn't be
that many kids there.

47:27.642 --> 47:30.712
Someone should notify ACS
about that, okay?

47:30.812 --> 47:32.062
Yeah.

47:34.900 --> 47:36.441
I'm gonna get back
to work.

47:38.070 --> 47:39.513
Are you happy now?

47:39.613 --> 47:41.014
What?

47:41.114 --> 47:42.140
Yeah, happy
that I'm sitting here

47:42.240 --> 47:43.850
with no lawyer?

47:43.950 --> 47:46.728
Seriously?
Are you-- No.

47:46.828 --> 47:49.564
No, that doesn't
make me happy.

47:49.664 --> 47:51.539
When I start something,
I like to finish it.

47:54.169 --> 47:55.279
Do you wanna go
into the office

47:55.379 --> 47:56.753
and try to get
your kids back?

47:58.882 --> 47:59.825
You're saying
you're gonna work

47:59.925 --> 48:01.493
for me again?

48:01.593 --> 48:03.787
No, Sara, I'm not saying
I'm gonna work for you.

48:03.887 --> 48:05.428
I'm gonna work
with you.

48:30.080 --> 48:32.733
Has ACS made
the necessary arrangements

48:32.833 --> 48:35.193
for supervision?

48:35.293 --> 48:36.778
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

48:36.878 --> 48:39.406
But our office has received
some new information

48:39.506 --> 48:40.949
we'd like to share
with the court.

48:41.049 --> 48:42.534
Mr. Denholz,
you have a habit

48:42.634 --> 48:44.036
of introducing
new information

48:44.136 --> 48:46.038
at the 11th hour
and I don't like it.

48:46.138 --> 48:47.456
I know.
I apologize, Your Honor.

48:47.556 --> 48:48.888
It will never--

48:53.353 --> 48:55.339
Ms. Diaz,

48:55.439 --> 48:58.383
did you tell this court
that David and Tia's father

48:58.483 --> 48:59.816
was dead?

49:04.239 --> 49:05.349
-Yes.
-Well,

49:05.449 --> 49:06.892
according
to this paperwork,

49:06.992 --> 49:08.977
the children's father,
Shawn Monroe,

49:09.077 --> 49:11.938
is very much alive
and incarcerated

49:12.038 --> 49:13.440
at
Buffalo State Penitentiary.

49:13.540 --> 49:14.983
Now, Ms. Diaz,

49:15.083 --> 49:16.860
you do understand
that there are penalties

49:16.960 --> 49:18.862
for not telling the truth
in the court of law.

49:18.962 --> 49:20.197
Yes, and I'm sorry,

49:20.297 --> 49:21.990
I was told he was dead
years ago.

49:22.090 --> 49:24.451
When was the last time
 the children saw their father?

49:24.551 --> 49:25.577
I don't know,
they were very little

49:25.677 --> 49:26.787
when he went to prison.

49:26.887 --> 49:28.288
Mr. Sanjuro,
have the children

49:28.388 --> 49:30.165
ever made mention
of the father?

49:30.265 --> 49:31.514
They believe he's dead,
Your Honor.

49:34.060 --> 49:35.128
Well, Ms. Diaz,

49:35.228 --> 49:36.922
until we consult
with the father,

49:37.022 --> 49:38.173
we can't make
any determination

49:38.273 --> 49:39.716
on their custody.

49:39.816 --> 49:41.510
No, but he's in prison.
He's a criminal.

49:41.610 --> 49:43.053
He was never interested
in them.

49:43.153 --> 49:44.930
Please control your temper,
Ms. Diaz.

49:45.030 --> 49:46.848
It doesn't matter
 if I control my temper or not,

49:46.948 --> 49:48.558
you're still gonna keep
my kids from me.

49:48.658 --> 49:52.020
I will not give you
another warning.

49:52.120 --> 49:53.939
- Take a deep breath.
-Mr. Denholz,

49:54.039 --> 49:56.483
when you make contact
with the children's father,

49:56.583 --> 49:58.360
can you please share
your findings

49:58.460 --> 50:00.112
with the court
immediately?

50:00.212 --> 50:02.781
 The respondent and her counsel
would be grateful

50:02.881 --> 50:04.199
to have that information prior

50:04.299 --> 50:05.992
to our next court hearing,
Your Honor.

50:06.092 --> 50:07.327
Due noted, Ms. Fisher,

50:07.427 --> 50:09.037
along with your sarcastic tone.

50:09.137 --> 50:11.054
And will you two
please stop the chattering?

50:13.016 --> 50:14.501
It looks like
someone else could use

50:14.601 --> 50:16.837
-a little anger management.
-That's it.

50:16.937 --> 50:18.371
Officer,
please escort Ms. Diaz

50:18.471 --> 50:19.831
-from the courtroom.
-No, it's fine.

50:19.931 --> 50:22.092
I'm leaving.
I'm invisible here.

50:22.192 --> 50:23.691
Wait for your counsel outside.

50:26.238 --> 50:28.598
As soon as I get the report
on the children's father,

50:28.698 --> 50:30.725
I will contact you to arrange

50:30.825 --> 50:32.894
for the next court appearance.

50:32.994 --> 50:34.521
And Ms. Fisher,

50:34.621 --> 50:36.731
perhaps, next time you can
troubleshoot information

50:36.831 --> 50:37.899
from your client.

50:37.999 --> 50:39.359
I don't like these surprises.

50:39.459 --> 50:41.209
Neither do I, Your Honor.

50:59.229 --> 51:01.006
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on, David.

51:01.106 --> 51:02.799
Hey!

51:02.899 --> 51:04.593
David, stop it.

51:04.693 --> 51:06.511
David, no more.

51:06.611 --> 51:08.305
-He's the jerk.
-Stop it, David!

51:08.405 --> 51:11.308
-Where's Ms. Cheney?
-She's right here!

51:11.408 --> 51:12.726
Sara.

51:12.826 --> 51:14.936
You're early today.

51:15.036 --> 51:16.327
The children just got home.

51:17.539 --> 51:18.815
Where have you been?

51:18.915 --> 51:19.983
I had to get some milk.

51:20.083 --> 51:21.124
I was just gone a minute.

51:22.794 --> 51:24.696
I didn't have a chance to call,

51:24.796 --> 51:26.490
but I told the kids
I was gonna take them

51:26.590 --> 51:28.825
for some dinner
and ice cream tonight.

51:28.925 --> 51:30.452
The ACS people
told you that, right?

51:30.552 --> 51:32.621
You know, a little something
special for them.

51:32.721 --> 51:34.247
-No, I don't remember any--
-Well, maybe they called

51:34.347 --> 51:35.624
when you were out getting your milk.

51:35.724 --> 51:37.876
We won't be long, I promise.

51:37.976 --> 51:38.976
Let me check my messages.

51:42.397 --> 51:44.049
Okay.

51:44.149 --> 51:45.634
Just go get your clothes
and backpack.

51:45.734 --> 51:47.052
And Tia,
go get Mr. Blacky.

51:47.152 --> 51:50.194
-Why?
-Please just do it, okay? Go.

52:04.544 --> 52:05.487
Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go.

52:05.587 --> 52:07.420
-I'm coming.
-Okay.

52:13.011 --> 52:14.011
Where are we going again?

52:15.263 --> 52:17.040
Hartford.

52:17.140 --> 52:19.543
Why are we going
to Hartford?

52:19.643 --> 52:22.420
Because it was the next bus
that was leaving.

52:22.520 --> 52:24.047
Where is Hartford?

52:24.147 --> 52:25.590
I don't know.

52:25.690 --> 52:27.467
What about school
tomorrow?

52:27.567 --> 52:29.302
You're getting
a vacation.

52:29.402 --> 52:30.804
Yes.

52:30.904 --> 52:32.138
-Sit down.
-Vacation from school.

52:32.238 --> 52:34.072
Put your seatbelt,
please.

52:40.580 --> 52:41.856
You see?

52:41.956 --> 52:43.400
Isn't this
just like old times?

52:43.500 --> 52:47.279
Yeah. Mm, have a little smog
for old times.

52:47.379 --> 52:48.697
This is cozy.

52:48.797 --> 52:50.115
Denise,
you did a great job

52:50.215 --> 52:51.575
setting this up for Dad.

52:51.675 --> 52:53.326
- Thank you.
--I miss the old place.

52:53.426 --> 52:54.786
Oh, we know, Daddy.

52:54.886 --> 52:56.413
It's natural.
I miss it, too.

52:56.513 --> 52:58.206
But yoknow what, you were
really smart to move in

52:58.306 --> 52:59.791
-to something smaller.
-Look, you are starting

52:59.891 --> 53:01.543
a new life.

53:01.643 --> 53:02.669
And the old house

53:02.769 --> 53:03.795
was a constant reminder
of Mom.

53:03.895 --> 53:05.380
What are you
talking about?

53:05.480 --> 53:07.215
I'm gonna miss your mother
wherever I am.

53:07.315 --> 53:08.967
That is not
what I meant and you know it.

53:09.067 --> 53:11.109
Okay. Okay.

53:14.406 --> 53:16.600
Denise, you make
the best green beans.

53:16.700 --> 53:17.865
-Thank you, Martha.
-Mm-hmm.

53:20.995 --> 53:22.453
Where's Jason tonight?

53:24.833 --> 53:26.457
I was afraid
you'd ask that.

53:33.007 --> 53:35.243
Jason and I
have separated.

53:35.343 --> 53:36.759
-You're joking.
-Why?

53:39.723 --> 53:41.416
He was fooling around
with the wife

53:41.516 --> 53:43.182
of a good friend
of mine.

53:44.978 --> 53:46.880
When did all this happen?

53:46.980 --> 53:48.506
A couple of weeks ago.

53:48.606 --> 53:49.758
And he left you?

53:49.858 --> 53:51.301
No, I kicked him out.

53:51.401 --> 53:53.720
-Good.
-Good? What's good about it?

53:53.820 --> 53:54.944
Excuse me?

53:56.698 --> 53:58.933
Nothing.

53:59.033 --> 54:00.268
I never would have guessed

54:00.368 --> 54:01.895
that he'd do
something like that.

54:01.995 --> 54:03.453
Did you tell Elliot?

54:05.582 --> 54:06.831
Not yet.

54:08.084 --> 54:10.153
We will,
once I calm down.

54:10.253 --> 54:11.905
Talk it out
with Jason first.

54:12.005 --> 54:12.989
Talk what out?

54:13.089 --> 54:14.866
He made a mistake.

54:14.966 --> 54:17.369
Men think
with their penis.

54:17.469 --> 54:20.372
A woman your age,
you don't wanna end up alone.

54:20.472 --> 54:21.831
Yes,
I'd rather be alone.

54:21.931 --> 54:23.708
How am I supposed
to trust him again?

54:23.808 --> 54:27.003
Just don't shut the door.
That's all I'm saying.

54:27.103 --> 54:28.088
Denise will tell you.

54:28.188 --> 54:29.422
After a certain age,

54:29.522 --> 54:31.549
you don't always get
a second chance.

54:31.649 --> 54:33.524
Are you kidding me?

54:35.987 --> 54:37.472
You're my father
and this is the advice

54:37.572 --> 54:39.224
you give me?

54:39.324 --> 54:40.392
-Jesus.
-Martha.

54:40.492 --> 54:43.034
Hmm, Martha.
Martha?

54:50.502 --> 54:51.903
Why aren't you asleep?

54:52.003 --> 54:53.003
What are you drinking?

54:54.756 --> 54:55.838
Wine cooler.

55:01.679 --> 55:03.456
Hey.

55:03.556 --> 55:05.264
What do you think
you're doing?

55:07.852 --> 55:11.381
You shouldn't drink.

55:11.481 --> 55:13.717
You're taking care
of me now?

55:13.817 --> 55:15.900
I don't want us getting
in any more trouble, Ma.

55:21.950 --> 55:23.074
I know.

55:24.577 --> 55:25.645
Okay.

55:25.745 --> 55:28.148
You go back to bed.

55:28.248 --> 55:29.747
I don't want you
to worry anymore.

55:36.589 --> 55:38.172
One day,
this will all be over.

55:39.384 --> 55:40.550
I promise.

56:06.536 --> 56:08.369
What the hell?

56:12.125 --> 56:13.943
- Hello?
-- Ally?

56:14.043 --> 56:16.070
This is Sara.

56:16.170 --> 56:17.947
Do you know
what time it is?

56:18.047 --> 56:19.491
I'm sorry.

56:19.591 --> 56:21.618
I'm in Hartford.

56:21.718 --> 56:22.758
You're where?

56:25.179 --> 56:27.248
I think I made a mistake.

56:27.348 --> 56:28.958
I'm sorry. Um--

56:29.058 --> 56:31.350
How come--
Are you still here?

56:37.275 --> 56:39.302
And what about the father?

56:39.402 --> 56:41.068
You knew
he wasn't dead, right?

56:43.531 --> 56:46.434
As far as I'm concerned,
he's dead.

56:46.534 --> 56:49.521
I don't want him back
in my life.

56:49.621 --> 56:51.120
Well, he's back.

56:53.583 --> 56:55.610
But he's in prison.
What can he do?

56:55.710 --> 56:56.986
He can make a stink.

56:57.086 --> 56:58.947
He can insist
on his day in court.

56:59.047 --> 57:00.156
What?
What are you saying?

57:00.256 --> 57:01.199
He can come to court?

57:01.299 --> 57:02.590
Yes.

57:04.427 --> 57:06.204
Who's this guy, anyway?

57:06.304 --> 57:08.623
I don't want
to talk about him.

57:08.723 --> 57:09.749
You're going to have
to talk about it

57:09.849 --> 57:11.265
one way or another.

57:21.819 --> 57:23.346
When I was 15,
I came to this country

57:23.446 --> 57:25.682
to visit my aunt.

57:25.782 --> 57:27.016
She got sick
and I had to stay

57:27.116 --> 57:28.101
and take care of her.

57:28.201 --> 57:29.492
I mean,
she had no one else.

57:33.081 --> 57:34.691
She died.

57:34.791 --> 57:36.276
I'm sorry.

57:36.376 --> 57:37.792
I was alone.

57:39.629 --> 57:40.670
I met Shawn.

57:42.340 --> 57:46.077
We got married
and I got my papers.

57:46.177 --> 57:48.010
Everything was really good
for a while.

57:50.181 --> 57:52.542
Then we had kids and, um,

57:52.642 --> 57:54.627
we needed more money.

57:54.727 --> 57:56.644
That's when he started
dealing drugs.

57:58.606 --> 58:00.091
One day, he told us
to go to Albany

58:00.191 --> 58:02.218
and meet him there.

58:02.318 --> 58:03.567
And?

58:05.947 --> 58:07.989
He had stuff
in Tia's diaper bag.

58:09.409 --> 58:10.768
Jeez.

58:10.868 --> 58:11.895
That's when I got busted.

58:11.995 --> 58:13.021
I mean,

58:13.121 --> 58:15.356
he got his.

58:15.456 --> 58:17.331
He got into a fight
and killed some guy.

58:19.669 --> 58:22.864
I just wanted to put
all this shit behind me.

58:22.964 --> 58:26.701
Well, unfortunately,
our shit travels with us.

58:26.801 --> 58:28.300
Oh, yeah.

58:38.104 --> 58:39.353
Keith.

58:40.982 --> 58:42.884
Can I call you Keith?

58:42.984 --> 58:45.011
Yes, of course,
call me Keith.

58:45.111 --> 58:47.263
I got those DS reports.
Thank you.

58:47.363 --> 58:49.182
Yeah, well, I figured
you didn't need

58:49.282 --> 58:50.725
any more surprises,
right?

58:50.825 --> 58:52.366
Your client supplies enough
on her own.

58:54.537 --> 58:55.855
She's a good person,
you know.

58:55.955 --> 58:57.190
Hello.

58:57.290 --> 58:59.317
She ran off
with her children.

58:59.417 --> 59:01.736
I told you guys that house
was overcrowded.

59:01.836 --> 59:03.321
Her kid was fighting
when she went to visit.

59:03.421 --> 59:04.781
There was no supervision.

59:04.881 --> 59:07.158
What she did was
completely understandable.

59:07.258 --> 59:08.785
Can you just cut her
a little bit

59:08.885 --> 59:10.411
of slack for once?

59:10.511 --> 59:13.498
No, it's not my job
to cut her slack.

59:13.598 --> 59:15.500
Come on, you can't
possibly be that hard.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.211
-Are you flirting with me?
-What?

59:18.311 --> 59:20.088
Jeez.
You're flirting with me.

59:20.188 --> 59:21.881
No, I'm not trying
to flirt with you.

59:21.981 --> 59:23.633
I'm trying to reason
with you.

59:23.733 --> 59:25.218
Okay, reason with me
in court.

59:25.318 --> 59:26.886
The authorities
had been notified.

59:26.986 --> 59:29.236
She'd be lucky if she avoids
kidnapping charges.

59:31.741 --> 59:34.352
You really suck,
you know that.

59:34.452 --> 59:36.187
I've seen what it's like
when you make a mistake

59:36.287 --> 59:38.231
and you hand a kid over
to an unstable parent.

59:38.331 --> 59:39.331
This is not a game.

59:45.379 --> 59:47.532
 It's been six weeks
since the city was shocked

59:47.632 --> 59:50.368
by the death of five-year-old
Sofia Martinez.

59:50.468 --> 59:52.370
And the mayor is expected
to announce today

59:52.470 --> 59:53.830
the findings
from the investigation

59:53.930 --> 59:55.289
into the case.

59:55.389 --> 59:56.582
New York One sources

59:56.682 --> 59:58.543
expect a major shake-up
in ACS.

59:58.643 --> 01:00:00.169
- Mr. Sanjuro.
--This was a week ago,

01:00:00.269 --> 01:00:01.629
-Your Honor.
-And the children?

01:00:01.729 --> 01:00:03.297
The children were in school
the next day,

01:00:03.397 --> 01:00:04.841
the foster parent
has been reported.

01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:06.175
The children are reassigned
to a new home.

01:00:06.275 --> 01:00:07.552
Thank you, Mr. Sanjuro.

01:00:07.652 --> 01:00:09.220
And the respondent
has had no contact

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.805
with the children since?

01:00:10.905 --> 01:00:12.265
Your Honor,
the visitation rights

01:00:12.365 --> 01:00:13.933
have been rescinded
till this hearing.

01:00:14.033 --> 01:00:15.309
And no word on the father?

01:00:15.409 --> 01:00:17.061
The father wishes
to be consulted

01:00:17.161 --> 01:00:18.688
on all matters of custody.

01:00:18.788 --> 01:00:20.023
Ms. Fisher.

01:00:20.123 --> 01:00:21.399
Your Honor,
my client believed

01:00:21.499 --> 01:00:23.067
that her children
were in danger.

01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:24.360
And by all accounts,
they were.

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.362
I notified that ACS
of the situation

01:00:26.462 --> 01:00:27.989
weeks ago to no avail.

01:00:28.089 --> 01:00:29.657
My client knows
that she was wrong

01:00:29.757 --> 01:00:31.451
in taking her children
for an overnight

01:00:31.551 --> 01:00:33.953
and promises the court
that it won't happen again.

01:00:34.053 --> 01:00:35.079
Ms. Diaz,
would you like to speak

01:00:35.179 --> 01:00:36.789
to the court directly?

01:00:36.889 --> 01:00:38.332
No, Your Honor.

01:00:38.432 --> 01:00:39.459
I'm going to leave

01:00:39.559 --> 01:00:40.626
all the talking
to my attorney.

01:00:40.726 --> 01:00:42.837
Ms. Dunbar?

01:00:42.937 --> 01:00:44.338
The children seemed fine.

01:00:44.438 --> 01:00:45.590
They would like to see
their mother

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.341
and we would like that,
too.

01:00:47.441 --> 01:00:48.843
Mr. Denholz,
where do you stand

01:00:48.943 --> 01:00:52.597
on the issue
of visitation?

01:00:52.697 --> 01:00:54.015
Your Honor,
we at the department

01:00:54.115 --> 01:00:56.059
have decided
not to press charges.

01:00:56.159 --> 01:00:59.312
We feel Ms. Diaz's actions
grew out of frustration

01:00:59.412 --> 01:01:00.730
and genuine concern
for the well-being

01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.148
of her children.

01:01:02.248 --> 01:01:04.650
We suggest that
we reinstate supervised

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.569
visitation rights
immediately.

01:01:06.669 --> 01:01:08.362
Very well.

01:01:08.462 --> 01:01:10.406
Mr. Denholz, let us know
when we have more information

01:01:10.506 --> 01:01:12.366
about the father.

01:01:12.466 --> 01:01:13.409
Yes, Your Honor.

01:01:13.509 --> 01:01:14.827
Thank you.

01:01:14.927 --> 01:01:15.927
Clear the court.

01:01:20.266 --> 01:01:23.002
What a lovely surprise.

01:01:23.102 --> 01:01:24.712
Are you feeling okay?

01:01:24.812 --> 01:01:27.381
Yes. I'm fine.

01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:29.926
Oh, it's so sweet
of you to visit.

01:01:30.026 --> 01:01:32.095
Yes, sit down.

01:01:32.195 --> 01:01:35.139
I hope you'll be here
for Thanksgiving.

01:01:35.239 --> 01:01:37.266
I haven't even thought
about it yet.

01:01:37.366 --> 01:01:39.102
Do you want something
to eat or drink?

01:01:39.202 --> 01:01:40.451
No. I'm okay.

01:01:42.079 --> 01:01:43.746
I want to talk to you
about something.

01:01:44.832 --> 01:01:46.442
Yes?

01:01:46.542 --> 01:01:49.126
Something that's not
entirely pleasant.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.171
Yes?

01:01:55.176 --> 01:01:57.829
You remember
when I was little

01:01:57.929 --> 01:02:00.039
-and Uncle Frank--
-Ah,

01:02:00.139 --> 01:02:01.916
yes, of course,
I remember.

01:02:02.016 --> 01:02:04.391
Do you think I'd forget
something like that?

01:02:06.854 --> 01:02:07.880
Well, that's the thing,
I don't know.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.298
You've never
acknowledged it.

01:02:09.398 --> 01:02:11.134
Well, why would I?

01:02:11.234 --> 01:02:12.677
You were young.

01:02:12.777 --> 01:02:15.888
These things get blown
out of well proportion.

01:02:15.988 --> 01:02:18.057
The memory

01:02:18.157 --> 01:02:20.643
plays its games.

01:02:20.743 --> 01:02:23.062
"The memory
plays its games?"

01:02:23.162 --> 01:02:24.772
Yes.

01:02:24.872 --> 01:02:26.107
I spoke to Frank
at the time,

01:02:26.207 --> 01:02:29.527
he said he was
just fooling around.

01:02:29.627 --> 01:02:33.406
It was
an innocent misunderstanding.

01:02:33.506 --> 01:02:36.909
He kept his distance
from you after that.

01:02:37.009 --> 01:02:39.218
You told me then
I was exaggerating.

01:02:40.805 --> 01:02:42.623
Because I believed
you were.

01:02:42.723 --> 01:02:44.000
You dismissed it.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.474
You dismissed me.

01:02:50.314 --> 01:02:53.092
Have you ever discuss this
with anyone?

01:02:53.192 --> 01:02:54.468
You mean aside
from the two shrinks

01:02:54.568 --> 01:02:56.470
that I've seen?

01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:57.847
No.

01:02:57.947 --> 01:02:59.029
Okay.

01:03:00.241 --> 01:03:02.351
Thank you for...

01:03:02.451 --> 01:03:04.937
keeping your promise.

01:03:05.037 --> 01:03:06.814
I didn't want this
to ever come

01:03:06.914 --> 01:03:09.108
between your father
and Frankie.

01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:12.153
Did you ever think
about me?

01:03:12.253 --> 01:03:13.988
It wasn't as though
he raped you

01:03:14.088 --> 01:03:15.337
for goodness sakes, dear.

01:03:17.174 --> 01:03:18.951
He touched me
inappropriately.

01:03:19.051 --> 01:03:20.828
Frankie said that
he was just tickling you.

01:03:20.928 --> 01:03:23.581
His hand was where
it shouldn't have been.

01:03:23.681 --> 01:03:25.958
He did things to me

01:03:26.058 --> 01:03:28.878
under the guise
have playing games.

01:03:28.978 --> 01:03:30.755
And he did it
in your house,

01:03:30.855 --> 01:03:33.424
and I told you
because I trusted you

01:03:33.524 --> 01:03:34.759
because you were
my grandmother.

01:03:34.859 --> 01:03:36.469
And I spoke to him

01:03:36.569 --> 01:03:39.013
and he never did it again,
right?

01:03:39.113 --> 01:03:42.308
-Not with me.
-Not with anyone!

01:03:42.408 --> 01:03:44.644
He's been in counseling
for years.

01:03:44.744 --> 01:03:46.938
Your uncle
has his problems

01:03:47.038 --> 01:03:50.191
but he continues
to seek help.

01:03:50.291 --> 01:03:52.652
It's water
under the bridge, Ally.

01:03:52.752 --> 01:03:54.403
You've got to stop hanging
onto that.

01:03:54.503 --> 01:03:57.198
I don't want to.
Do you think I want to?

01:03:57.298 --> 01:03:58.449
-Believe me, I don't.
-All right, I am very,

01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:59.951
very sorry.

01:04:00.051 --> 01:04:01.535
Okay?

01:04:01.635 --> 01:04:04.497
Is that what
you want to hear?

01:04:04.597 --> 01:04:06.499
You've got to let it go

01:04:06.599 --> 01:04:08.182
for the family's sake.

01:04:09.352 --> 01:04:10.517
Just...

01:04:17.193 --> 01:04:20.596
-What's this?
-Read it, two citations

01:04:20.696 --> 01:04:22.446
for loitering
around schools.

01:04:24.116 --> 01:04:25.142
Where'd you get this?

01:04:25.242 --> 01:04:26.978
I work in family court.

01:04:27.078 --> 01:04:29.939
I was looking for a document
that had my name attached.

01:04:30.039 --> 01:04:31.816
Well, this was
a long time ago.

01:04:31.916 --> 01:04:34.124
The second one
was not that long ago.

01:04:42.927 --> 01:04:45.052
This is not
an easy thing to say.

01:04:48.432 --> 01:04:50.265
But you're not going to be
around forever.

01:04:52.311 --> 01:04:54.880
You have to tell Dad.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:57.800
It is
in everyone's best interest

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.176
before Uncle Frank
gets himself

01:04:59.276 --> 01:05:00.177
into real trouble.

01:05:00.277 --> 01:05:02.096
He is very sick.

01:05:02.196 --> 01:05:03.987
He is on medication now.

01:05:07.118 --> 01:05:08.492
Tell Dad.

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:12.857
I'll give it some thought.

01:05:12.957 --> 01:05:14.248
There's nothing
to think about.

01:05:16.377 --> 01:05:18.836
You tell him now
or I will.

01:05:24.343 --> 01:05:26.802
You have a cruel streak,
young lady.

01:05:30.224 --> 01:05:31.917
Well,

01:05:32.017 --> 01:05:33.559
I am your granddaughter.

01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:42.094
You tell him
by this weekend

01:05:42.194 --> 01:05:44.153
or I will.

01:05:50.703 --> 01:05:51.994
Bye, Gram.

01:06:25.946 --> 01:06:27.932
Mr. Sanjuro.

01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:30.393
Ms. Schulman.

01:06:30.493 --> 01:06:33.020
I am so sorry.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.189
Thank you.

01:06:35.289 --> 01:06:36.482
You know,
if there's any consolation,

01:06:36.582 --> 01:06:38.192
they had no business

01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:39.777
putting you on leave
especially without pay.

01:06:39.877 --> 01:06:41.362
They just needed
a fall guy.

01:06:41.462 --> 01:06:43.030
Yeah, I know.

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:44.532
You got any plans?

01:06:44.632 --> 01:06:45.825
My brother-in-law
got me a job

01:06:45.925 --> 01:06:47.952
at a place
called Gracious Homes.

01:06:48.052 --> 01:06:50.121
-Ah, oh, yeah.
-Yeah, and, uh,

01:06:50.221 --> 01:06:51.622
I'd have to pay my dues first
but he says I'll be in line

01:06:51.722 --> 01:06:53.499
for a manager's job.

01:06:53.599 --> 01:06:55.793
Ah, the salary is better
 than what I'm pulling in here.

01:06:55.893 --> 01:06:57.461
Oh, I wish you well.

01:06:57.561 --> 01:06:59.588
It's got to be a loss
not having you here.

01:06:59.688 --> 01:07:02.633
I guess I'll miss it,
but I won't miss the stress.

01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:04.927
There's something
to be said for that.

01:07:05.027 --> 01:07:06.762
But, you know,
maybe this will all blow over

01:07:06.862 --> 01:07:09.140
and they'll reinstate you.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.891
You know, I can't really see
myself coming back here

01:07:10.991 --> 01:07:12.101
to tell you the truth.

01:07:12.201 --> 01:07:14.186
I understand.

01:07:14.286 --> 01:07:15.577
You...

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.858
You always run
a great court.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:20.734
Oh, thank you.

01:07:20.834 --> 01:07:22.626
I know I wasn't
everyone's favorite judge.

01:07:24.296 --> 01:07:26.615
Have a great Thanksgiving.

01:07:26.715 --> 01:07:28.090
You as well.

01:07:31.262 --> 01:07:32.511
Enter.

01:07:34.431 --> 01:07:36.709
Nice office.

01:07:36.809 --> 01:07:39.587
No, it's not.

01:07:39.687 --> 01:07:42.423
-Sit down.
-What's up?

01:07:42.523 --> 01:07:44.633
I want to talk you
about the DS case

01:07:44.733 --> 01:07:46.400
and not while I'm getting
into the elevator.

01:07:48.195 --> 01:07:49.430
Here's the deal.

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:50.639
The father says

01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:52.475
that he will not
contest custody

01:07:52.575 --> 01:07:53.726
if we just let him meet

01:07:53.826 --> 01:07:54.768
with the mother
and the children.

01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:55.978
Hmm, no, I don't think

01:07:56.078 --> 01:07:57.354
she's going
to go for that.

01:07:57.454 --> 01:07:59.440
She said he set her up
in a drug bust.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.900
There's bad blood there.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.401
Be that as it may,
the mother, basically,

01:08:02.501 --> 01:08:03.861
absconded with
the man's children

01:08:03.961 --> 01:08:05.279
and he's been trying
to track them down

01:08:05.379 --> 01:08:06.697
-for years.
-From prison?

01:08:06.797 --> 01:08:08.199
Hey, he's still
the kids' father.

01:08:08.299 --> 01:08:10.618
Scumbag or not,
he still has parental rights.

01:08:10.718 --> 01:08:12.286
Well, I'll run it by her.

01:08:12.386 --> 01:08:13.746
Okay.

01:08:13.846 --> 01:08:16.040
Would you like some
of my brownie?

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.374
No.

01:08:17.474 --> 01:08:19.627
-Thank you.
-You know,

01:08:19.727 --> 01:08:23.255
it took some doing
to get him to back off.

01:08:23.354 --> 01:08:25.090
-I'm just saying--
-Why are you doing this?

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:27.426
No reason, I just see that
it's a very important case

01:08:27.526 --> 01:08:30.060
to you and I want to help you.
No agenda.

01:08:33.198 --> 01:08:34.600
Well, thank you.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.018
Would you like to get
a drink sometime?

01:08:36.118 --> 01:08:37.728
You know what, Mr. Denholz,
this is getting

01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:39.313
a little bit unprofessional,
wouldn't you say?

01:08:39.412 --> 01:08:41.439
Last time it was Keith
and you were flirting

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.901
-with me first.
-I did not flirt with you,

01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:45.185
and I think it would be inappropriate

01:08:45.285 --> 01:08:46.529
for us to socialize.

01:08:46.629 --> 01:08:48.072
Some people might think
it was inappropriate

01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:49.782
for you to pick up
your runaway client

01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:51.908
and her children in Hartford

01:08:52.009 --> 01:08:53.786
but not me, of course.

01:08:53.886 --> 01:08:55.996
I think that it's very kind

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:58.957
and gracious of you.

01:08:59.058 --> 01:09:01.350
I'll get back to you
after I speak to my client.

01:09:02.519 --> 01:09:04.421
Asshole.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.091
Let's hear the whip, man.
 You saw them in the video, yo?

01:09:07.191 --> 01:09:09.926
I don't know how to do the mango.

01:09:10.027 --> 01:09:12.971
-I got it, my man.
-Yo, and it comes in, man.

01:09:13.072 --> 01:09:14.890
That shit's so hard, yo.

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:16.892
Ooh, hey.

01:09:18.618 --> 01:09:19.937
You're early,

01:09:20.037 --> 01:09:21.854
by an hour.

01:09:21.955 --> 01:09:24.081
I'm sorry, I guess,
I couldn't wait to see you.

01:09:30.798 --> 01:09:35.286
-You like it?
-Yeah. Yeah, it's different.

01:09:35.386 --> 01:09:37.453
In case you haven't guessed,
I'm Elliot's mother.

01:09:37.554 --> 01:09:39.163
-Hey!
-Oh.

01:09:39.264 --> 01:09:41.500
I'm Isaiah and Elliot,
you did not tell me

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.460
that your mother
was this fly.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.837
Man, shut up.

01:09:44.937 --> 01:09:45.962
I'm the new roommate.

01:09:46.063 --> 01:09:47.171
What happen to Ben?

01:09:47.272 --> 01:09:48.966
-They swapped.
-Yeah.

01:09:49.066 --> 01:09:50.267
Better fit.

01:09:50.567 --> 01:09:52.386
Well, Elliot
never said anything, so...

01:09:52.486 --> 01:09:54.430
-Oh, well.
-Us uptown guys

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:57.280
got to hang together,
Mrs. S.

01:10:04.456 --> 01:10:06.400
Dorm stinks of pot.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.819
This campus stinks of pot.

01:10:08.919 --> 01:10:10.279
Am I to assume

01:10:10.379 --> 01:10:12.656
that you're smoking it
these days?

01:10:12.756 --> 01:10:14.033
I suppose.

01:10:14.133 --> 01:10:15.743
You know how I feel
about drugs.

01:10:15.843 --> 01:10:17.244
It's not like
I'm gonna start doing heroine

01:10:17.344 --> 01:10:19.246
-like your brother.
-This is not something

01:10:19.346 --> 01:10:21.040
to make light of, Elliot.

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.140
Sorry.

01:10:24.017 --> 01:10:25.544
I mean,
pot is practically legal now.

01:10:25.644 --> 01:10:27.436
It's not that
big of a deal.

01:10:34.153 --> 01:10:35.596
Oh,
you looking forward

01:10:35.696 --> 01:10:37.556
to being back
in the city?

01:10:37.656 --> 01:10:39.850
It'd be nice to be home.

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:41.852
It'd be nice
to have you there.

01:10:41.952 --> 01:10:43.660
Weird without Dad.

01:10:45.956 --> 01:10:47.524
Looking forward
to seeing Julie?

01:10:47.624 --> 01:10:48.984
No.

01:10:49.084 --> 01:10:51.278
-No, we're finished.
-What?

01:10:51.378 --> 01:10:52.404
You two were inseparable.

01:10:52.504 --> 01:10:54.073
I know, but come on.

01:10:54.173 --> 01:10:56.909
She's in Pennsylvania,
I'm in Connecticut.

01:10:57.009 --> 01:11:00.079
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I'm telling you now.

01:11:00.179 --> 01:11:02.915
Well, is that okay?

01:11:03.015 --> 01:11:05.459
-Don't worry about me, Mom.
-I'm not worried about you.

01:11:05.559 --> 01:11:06.794
I'm worried about Julie.

01:11:06.894 --> 01:11:08.671
She can take care
of herself.

01:11:08.771 --> 01:11:10.547
Plus, I'm dating
a junior now.

01:11:10.647 --> 01:11:12.466
You've moved on already,
huh?

01:11:12.566 --> 01:11:14.718
Yeah.
And she's black.

01:11:14.818 --> 01:11:16.470
She's older and it's fun
dating someone

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:19.390
-more sexually-experienced.
-Ugh.

01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:21.364
That's too much information,
Elliot.

01:11:29.708 --> 01:11:31.443
How about you?

01:11:31.543 --> 01:11:33.696
How about me what?

01:11:33.796 --> 01:11:35.823
Are you seeing anyone?

01:11:35.923 --> 01:11:39.535
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Of course, not.

01:11:39.635 --> 01:11:41.009
You're still pissed
at Dad?

01:11:44.598 --> 01:11:46.750
Elliot, I'm not gonna talk
about your father.

01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:49.753
It's between me and him.

01:11:49.853 --> 01:11:50.921
-We both love you.
-Yeah.

01:11:51.021 --> 01:11:52.297
You guys always wanna know

01:11:52.397 --> 01:11:53.507
everything about me,
but I don't know

01:11:53.607 --> 01:11:55.551
anything about you two.

01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:57.067
Nothing.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:14.069
Mom,
there's so many cheesecakes.

01:12:14.169 --> 01:12:16.155
Aren't we supposed
to have pumpkin pie, though?

01:12:16.255 --> 01:12:18.115
I think you can have
whatever you want.

01:12:18.215 --> 01:12:19.867
Right, Mom?

01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:21.952
This place is so nice.

01:12:22.052 --> 01:12:24.413
What do you kids
say to Ms. Fisher?

01:12:24.513 --> 01:12:27.040
- Thank you.
-You're so welcome.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.500
Did you see
how I called you miss

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.669
just like you-know-who?

01:12:30.769 --> 01:12:32.296
I heard that, yeah.

01:12:32.396 --> 01:12:33.839
Oh, we're gonna take
that to go.

01:12:33.939 --> 01:12:36.049
Dessert?
It came with a meal.

01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:37.926
We have pumpkin cheesecake
tonight

01:12:38.026 --> 01:12:39.720
and of course,
pumpkin pie.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.346
What do you kids want?

01:12:41.446 --> 01:12:42.806
Can I have
the cherry cheesecake?

01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:44.308
I can't decide.

01:12:44.408 --> 01:12:45.768
How about you order
two desserts

01:12:45.868 --> 01:12:47.895
because I'm not
gonna have mine?

01:12:47.995 --> 01:12:49.229
Okay, I'm having
pumpkin pie

01:12:49.329 --> 01:12:50.647
and
a pineapple cheesecake.

01:12:50.747 --> 01:12:51.940
No, no, no.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.692
The pumpkin pie to go,
please.

01:12:53.792 --> 01:12:55.027
Thank you.

01:12:55.127 --> 01:12:56.737
I'm so full.

01:12:56.837 --> 01:12:59.114
I cannot eat
another thing.

01:12:59.214 --> 01:13:01.742
How come you're not
with your family today?

01:13:01.842 --> 01:13:04.953
Trust me, I've seen
plenty of them lately.

01:13:05.053 --> 01:13:06.455
And no boyfriend?

01:13:06.555 --> 01:13:07.664
No.

01:13:07.764 --> 01:13:09.124
You're very pretty.

01:13:09.224 --> 01:13:10.375
Thank you.

01:13:10.475 --> 01:13:12.169
- So are you.
--Oh.

01:13:12.269 --> 01:13:14.630
I'm so proud of my kids.

01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:17.466
This has been a really
wonderful Thanksgiving.

01:13:17.566 --> 01:13:18.773
Thank you.

01:13:20.027 --> 01:13:24.181
Why are you thanking us?

01:13:24.281 --> 01:13:27.017
Oh, my gosh.

01:13:27.117 --> 01:13:28.644
No, no, no, no,

01:13:28.744 --> 01:13:30.604
-no, no, no, no, no, no.
-No, but it's mine.

01:13:30.704 --> 01:13:31.953
You said
that you were stuffed?

01:13:35.918 --> 01:13:37.069
You know,
I'm getting used to this

01:13:37.169 --> 01:13:39.571
and so are the kids.

01:13:39.671 --> 01:13:42.282
I've forgotten what it's like
to have them home.

01:13:42.382 --> 01:13:43.465
Yeah.

01:13:46.386 --> 01:13:48.205
What's going on?

01:13:48.305 --> 01:13:50.374
I know
something's going on.

01:13:50.474 --> 01:13:52.251
Do you really want
to discuss this now?

01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:53.961
Yes.

01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:55.268
Tell me.

01:13:56.647 --> 01:13:58.647
He's coming down
to testify.

01:14:03.028 --> 01:14:05.973
Oh, my God.

01:14:06.073 --> 01:14:07.182
You're not gonna really

01:14:07.282 --> 01:14:08.475
have much choice
in the matter.

01:14:08.575 --> 01:14:09.575
You have to talk to him.

01:14:11.662 --> 01:14:13.036
Have you told the kids?

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:17.526
What am I
gonna tell them?

01:14:17.626 --> 01:14:20.335
-Tell them the truth?
-Well, the truth is I lied.

01:14:22.881 --> 01:14:24.673
These kids are
so confused already.

01:14:27.386 --> 01:14:29.204
Go in there now
and tell them.

01:14:29.304 --> 01:14:30.622
-Now?
-Yes.

01:14:30.722 --> 01:14:32.958
No. We had
a wonderful night.

01:14:33.058 --> 01:14:34.307
Do it.

01:14:39.481 --> 01:14:40.883
You come with me?

01:14:40.983 --> 01:14:42.843
No. No, I'm not
coming with you.

01:14:42.943 --> 01:14:44.303
Yes, you're coming with me
and I'll tell them.

01:14:44.403 --> 01:14:46.194
-No.
-Come, yes.

01:14:50.325 --> 01:14:51.366
Okay.

01:14:59.626 --> 01:15:01.695
I thought
you were gonna be out?

01:15:01.795 --> 01:15:03.545
No, I'm here.

01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:05.991
Come in.

01:15:06.091 --> 01:15:07.659
Yeah. You're not
gonna come after me

01:15:07.759 --> 01:15:09.745
with a pair of scissors,
are you?

01:15:09.845 --> 01:15:10.996
It's not funny.

01:15:11.096 --> 01:15:13.790
Well, it is, sort of.

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:15.515
Let's sit for awhile.

01:15:18.562 --> 01:15:20.145
Oh, thanks.

01:15:21.857 --> 01:15:24.176
How are you doing?

01:15:24.276 --> 01:15:27.512
Elliot said the two of you
had a good Thanksgiving.

01:15:27.612 --> 01:15:29.056
It was okay.

01:15:29.156 --> 01:15:31.141
I think he's smoking
too much pot.

01:15:31.241 --> 01:15:32.684
He's in college.

01:15:32.784 --> 01:15:34.227
That's what you do.

01:15:34.327 --> 01:15:36.786
He's fine.
Don't worry about him.

01:15:39.666 --> 01:15:42.861
-Martha, we have to talk.
-Yeah.

01:15:42.961 --> 01:15:43.987
I wanna talk first.

01:15:44.087 --> 01:15:45.113
On the aggrieved party,

01:15:45.213 --> 01:15:46.531
we always get
to speak first.

01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:49.049
-Are we in court now?
-No.

01:15:51.762 --> 01:15:52.762
First of all,

01:15:54.389 --> 01:15:56.750
I'm sorry that I cut up
your clothes.

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:59.378
I was shocked
at my behavior

01:15:59.478 --> 01:16:01.713
and I said some
very ugly things.

01:16:01.813 --> 01:16:04.633
I think your behavior
was very understandable.

01:16:04.733 --> 01:16:06.107
I hit you.

01:16:08.653 --> 01:16:10.055
I've never hit
anyone in my life.

01:16:10.155 --> 01:16:13.725
I've never felt that rage.

01:16:13.825 --> 01:16:18.897
I deal with people all day
that have that type of anger

01:16:18.997 --> 01:16:20.941
and I just never thought
that I was capable of that.

01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:22.484
Martha,
you had every right--

01:16:22.584 --> 01:16:23.610
Please,

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:26.196
I'm not done.

01:16:26.296 --> 01:16:28.156
I'm thinking
a lot about myself

01:16:28.256 --> 01:16:31.952
and, you know,
I'm far from perfect.

01:16:32.052 --> 01:16:33.161
I spoke to Drew

01:16:33.261 --> 01:16:36.289
and he and Nancy
have reconciled.

01:16:36.389 --> 01:16:38.291
I can't say that
I'm not still angry,

01:16:38.391 --> 01:16:39.432
but...

01:16:43.522 --> 01:16:44.923
Jesus, Jason,
we've been together

01:16:45.023 --> 01:16:46.299
for 23 years.

01:16:46.399 --> 01:16:48.719
I know.

01:16:48.819 --> 01:16:49.803
And I hated you
for what you did,

01:16:49.903 --> 01:16:51.471
but I'm over it.

01:16:51.571 --> 01:16:53.223
No,

01:16:53.323 --> 01:16:57.060
I'm not over it,
but I've accepted it.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.146
Although,
trust remains an issue.

01:16:59.246 --> 01:17:00.703
The fact is,

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:06.319
I want us to move on
from this.

01:17:06.419 --> 01:17:07.946
-Martha--
-Let me finish.

01:17:08.046 --> 01:17:09.838
-I want--
-I want a divorce.

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:17.971
What?

01:17:20.392 --> 01:17:22.669
I want a divorce.

01:17:22.769 --> 01:17:27.021
It's not about Nancy,
it's about us.

01:17:31.027 --> 01:17:33.472
I love you very much,

01:17:33.572 --> 01:17:37.017
but us, our marriage,

01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:39.227
I feel dead.

01:17:39.327 --> 01:17:41.688
Dead?

01:17:41.788 --> 01:17:43.315
Why didn't you say
anything before?

01:17:43.415 --> 01:17:44.983
You're hard to engage,
Martha.

01:17:45.083 --> 01:17:46.651
-I wanna talk.
-Not really.

01:17:46.751 --> 01:17:49.196
You come home
wiped out from work.

01:17:49.296 --> 01:17:51.323
You never tell me
about what's going on--

01:17:51.423 --> 01:17:53.200
What, you wanna hear
about the 13-year-old

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.202
I put in handcuffs
and sent to detention

01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:56.912
or the mother
who scolded her baby?

01:17:57.012 --> 01:17:59.206
I come home to get away
from all of that.

01:17:59.306 --> 01:18:00.916
-Bottom line, Martha--
-But--

01:18:01.016 --> 01:18:02.751
-I'm not happy.
-No one's happy

01:18:02.851 --> 01:18:04.309
all the time.

01:18:07.355 --> 01:18:09.049
For Christ's sakes,
but you never said

01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:11.176
that you were so unhappy
that you need to go

01:18:11.276 --> 01:18:12.969
outside of our marriage
for love, for sex.

01:18:13.069 --> 01:18:14.221
It doesn't work that way.

01:18:14.321 --> 01:18:18.016
Nothing is that neat
and tidy.

01:18:18.116 --> 01:18:20.143
You are an amazing woman.

01:18:20.243 --> 01:18:22.479
You-- You've worked so hard
to get where you are,

01:18:22.579 --> 01:18:24.648
where we are,

01:18:24.748 --> 01:18:26.483
but I think we want
different kinds

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:27.651
of lives now.

01:18:27.751 --> 01:18:29.236
We? Do not presume

01:18:29.336 --> 01:18:32.572
-what I want.
-I screwed up. I screwed up.

01:18:32.672 --> 01:18:35.367
But you have got to take
 some responsibility here, too.

01:18:35.467 --> 01:18:38.537
When anything unpleasant
ever arose between us,

01:18:38.637 --> 01:18:39.996
you just deflected it.

01:18:40.096 --> 01:18:42.082
You are hard to reach.

01:18:42.182 --> 01:18:44.292
You are in no position
to lecture me.

01:18:44.392 --> 01:18:46.086
I'm not lecturing,
God damn it.

01:18:46.186 --> 01:18:48.130
I'm telling you
how I feel.

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:50.632
Are you or you're just
justifying your own behavior?

01:18:50.732 --> 01:18:52.425
I thought we were
a team, Jason?

01:18:52.525 --> 01:18:54.845
I thought we had
each other's back.

01:18:54.945 --> 01:18:55.929
I mean,
we struggled together.

01:18:56.029 --> 01:18:57.639
What happened?

01:18:57.739 --> 01:18:59.349
I don't even know
who the hell you are now.

01:18:59.449 --> 01:19:01.616
I guess, I can say
the same about you.

01:19:06.373 --> 01:19:07.830
Yeah? Well...

01:19:13.797 --> 01:19:15.588
I guess
you're right about that.

01:19:17.842 --> 01:19:21.621
Because if you knew me,
if you respected me,

01:19:21.721 --> 01:19:24.040
then we wouldn't be
where we are right now.

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.709
You know,
the bottom line,

01:19:25.809 --> 01:19:28.545
Jason, is that
I don't trust you.

01:19:28.645 --> 01:19:30.589
Right?
And I can't believe

01:19:30.689 --> 01:19:34.176
that I was even thinking
about saving this marriage.

01:19:34.276 --> 01:19:36.052
I mean, God only knows

01:19:36.152 --> 01:19:37.345
what other women
you've screwed.

01:19:37.445 --> 01:19:39.195
I've been too afraid
to ask you that.

01:19:40.657 --> 01:19:42.142
You're a liar, Jason.

01:19:42.242 --> 01:19:44.853
Please, we have been lying
to ourselves

01:19:44.953 --> 01:19:46.563
for years.

01:19:46.663 --> 01:19:49.691
I want you
to get your things

01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:51.359
and get out of my house.

01:19:51.459 --> 01:19:52.986
-Your house?
-Yeah.

01:19:53.086 --> 01:19:56.323
It was ours
before you destroyed it.

01:19:56.423 --> 01:19:57.505
Go!

01:20:00.093 --> 01:20:01.134
Now!

01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:47.540
Raise your right hand.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.833
Do you swear
to tell the truth?

01:20:48.933 --> 01:20:50.335
-I do.
-State your name

01:20:50.435 --> 01:20:51.962
for the record, please.

01:20:52.062 --> 01:20:53.380
Shawn Monroe.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.257
Do you know
why you're here today?

01:20:55.357 --> 01:20:57.759
Yes.

01:20:57.859 --> 01:20:59.135
When was the last time
you saw your children,

01:20:59.235 --> 01:21:00.887
Mr. Monroe?

01:21:00.987 --> 01:21:02.514
Since I was arrested.

01:21:02.614 --> 01:21:05.600
I guess six years or so.

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.019
Have you tried
any contact with them?

01:21:08.119 --> 01:21:09.771
I tried, yeah.

01:21:09.871 --> 01:21:13.400
So, you are aware
of the current circumstances

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.860
-of your former wife?
-Former?

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.570
We're still married.

01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:19.239
I mean,
as far as I know.

01:21:19.339 --> 01:21:22.075
Okay.
Do you know that your wife

01:21:22.175 --> 01:21:23.925
believed you were dead?

01:21:26.262 --> 01:21:27.262
Is that what she said?

01:21:30.183 --> 01:21:34.796
Well, maybe
that's what she thought.

01:21:34.896 --> 01:21:36.798
Maybe I was dead.

01:21:36.898 --> 01:21:38.356
Excuse me?

01:21:39.692 --> 01:21:40.760
You know,
maybe the Shawn

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.138
that she knew died.

01:21:43.238 --> 01:21:44.904
This is another Shawn
standing here.

01:21:48.618 --> 01:21:50.687
Mr. Monroe,

01:21:50.787 --> 01:21:52.814
the law allows you

01:21:52.914 --> 01:21:53.940
the right to weigh in
on the current

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.859
custody matter at hand

01:21:55.959 --> 01:21:57.861
and this court will certainly
take your remarks

01:21:57.961 --> 01:21:59.487
into consideration

01:21:59.587 --> 01:22:01.072
but because
 of your present incarceration,

01:22:01.172 --> 01:22:03.047
your wishes are
in no way binding.

01:22:06.010 --> 01:22:07.412
I don't like
that I haven't been able

01:22:07.512 --> 01:22:10.498
to see my kids.

01:22:10.598 --> 01:22:12.959
I don't like that
I've been erased from them,

01:22:13.059 --> 01:22:14.767
like I never
even mattered.

01:22:16.146 --> 01:22:18.590
They got family.

01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:20.467
They have a grandmother
who wants to know them,

01:22:20.567 --> 01:22:22.066
who should know them.

01:22:27.282 --> 01:22:31.701
I think that Sara
is probably a good mother.

01:22:34.622 --> 01:22:36.649
I wanna hear that
from my kids.

01:22:36.749 --> 01:22:37.832
I do.

01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:40.376
I got no problem.

01:22:46.426 --> 01:22:48.801
Judge, I know I haven't been
any kind of father,

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.680
but those kids are still
my flesh and blood, too.

01:22:54.893 --> 01:22:56.920
I just--

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.020
I wanna know them
is all I'm saying.

01:23:01.441 --> 01:23:03.024
To look at them.

01:23:05.195 --> 01:23:06.986
I wanna tell them
that I'm sorry.

01:23:09.324 --> 01:23:11.476
Are there any objections
to Mr. Monroe

01:23:11.576 --> 01:23:13.436
meeting with his children,
Ms. Dunbar?

01:23:13.536 --> 01:23:15.355
Not if it facilitates

01:23:15.455 --> 01:23:17.107
the children's return
to their mother, Your Honor.

01:23:17.207 --> 01:23:19.317
- Mr. Denholz?
--No. No, Your Honor.

01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:21.820
We request
that the visits be supervised

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.003
and that Ms. Diaz
be in attendance.

01:23:25.673 --> 01:23:26.714
Ms. Diaz?

01:23:33.223 --> 01:23:35.917
My client agrees
to these terms, Your Honor.

01:23:36.017 --> 01:23:38.628
I need Ms. Diaz
to state her answer

01:23:38.728 --> 01:23:40.353
for the record, please.

01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:45.733
I got no problem
with that, Your Honor.

01:23:52.992 --> 01:23:55.076
What's taking them
so long?

01:23:57.038 --> 01:23:59.372
They've got a lot of things
to talk about.

01:24:03.336 --> 01:24:06.072
What if I don't like him?

01:24:06.172 --> 01:24:07.421
Maybe you will like him.

01:24:08.633 --> 01:24:10.258
He's in jail.

01:24:11.636 --> 01:24:13.872
Sometimes good people

01:24:13.972 --> 01:24:15.874
make mistakes.

01:24:15.974 --> 01:24:19.377
Not my idea of a father.

01:24:19.477 --> 01:24:21.936
I just don't
wanna see him.

01:24:23.314 --> 01:24:25.106
Unfortunately,
you have to.

01:24:29.404 --> 01:24:30.486
Okay.

01:24:31.573 --> 01:24:32.807
Let's go.

01:24:32.907 --> 01:24:35.143
I don't wanna go.

01:24:35.243 --> 01:24:36.978
Oh, come on, Tia,

01:24:37.078 --> 01:24:38.146
everything's
gonna be fine.

01:24:38.246 --> 01:24:39.829
Come on.

01:24:44.919 --> 01:24:45.945
Come on, David, let's go.

01:24:46.045 --> 01:24:47.086
Do I look like him?

01:24:50.174 --> 01:24:51.868
What?

01:24:51.968 --> 01:24:53.578
I just wanna know
before I go in there.

01:24:53.678 --> 01:24:54.927
Do I look like him?

01:24:58.016 --> 01:24:59.667
Yeah, maybe a little.

01:24:59.767 --> 01:25:01.377
What should I call him?

01:25:01.477 --> 01:25:03.129
David, why are you asking me
these questions now?

01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:04.589
-Call him whatever you want.
-You never even

01:25:04.689 --> 01:25:05.715
told me his name.

01:25:05.815 --> 01:25:07.982
-I did.
-No, you didn't.

01:25:12.488 --> 01:25:13.821
Maybe I didn't.

01:25:15.283 --> 01:25:16.782
Well, his name is Shawn.

01:25:18.328 --> 01:25:20.146
It's gonna be fine.

01:25:20.246 --> 01:25:21.537
I promise.
Come on.

01:25:33.968 --> 01:25:37.372
Did I do something wrong?

01:25:37.472 --> 01:25:40.124
I was hurt when you told me
to hold on to Jason.

01:25:40.224 --> 01:25:42.835
I knew
you were upset about that.

01:25:42.935 --> 01:25:45.547
I was thinking more
as a man than as a father.

01:25:45.647 --> 01:25:47.006
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:25:47.106 --> 01:25:49.050
Men are weaker than women.

01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:51.010
A lot of temptation
out there

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:52.887
and men are the first
to fall.

01:25:52.987 --> 01:25:55.181
-You really believe that?
-Yeah, I do.

01:25:55.281 --> 01:25:56.474
Look what happen
to your brother.

01:25:56.574 --> 01:25:58.351
Come on,
Buddy didn't end up dead

01:25:58.451 --> 01:26:00.061
in the bathroom with a needle
stuck in his arm

01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:02.313
-because of temptation.
-Buddy was weak.

01:26:02.413 --> 01:26:04.315
How do you know that?

01:26:04.415 --> 01:26:05.900
Did you ever have
any real conversation

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.694
-with Buddy?
 -What's that supposed to mean?

01:26:07.794 --> 01:26:11.698
We didn't do much talking
in our house, Pop.

01:26:11.798 --> 01:26:13.491
I mean, who knows what
kind of demons Buddy was--

01:26:13.591 --> 01:26:15.410
So, it's my fault
that I didn't talk?

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:16.869
For Christ's sakes,
it's no one's fault, Pop.

01:26:16.969 --> 01:26:18.997
-We never saw it coming.
-Let it go.

01:26:19.097 --> 01:26:20.373
It was a lifetime ago

01:26:20.473 --> 01:26:22.959
and you and Mom
did the best you could.

01:26:23.059 --> 01:26:24.294
And it don't go away,

01:26:24.394 --> 01:26:26.045
especially
at this time of year.

01:26:29.357 --> 01:26:31.926
Stop beating
yourself up over it.

01:26:32.026 --> 01:26:33.386
And you're gonna tell me
you're not gonna beat

01:26:33.486 --> 01:26:36.514
yourself up about Jason leaving?

01:26:36.614 --> 01:26:38.433
Did you see that coming?

01:26:38.533 --> 01:26:40.116
Did you?

01:26:45.915 --> 01:26:47.456
I guess not.

01:26:50.712 --> 01:26:53.948
I know it hasn't been
easy on you, Martha,

01:26:54.048 --> 01:26:57.035
but you can talk to me,

01:26:57.135 --> 01:26:58.426
you know.

01:27:05.476 --> 01:27:08.671
I feel like a loser, Daddy.

01:27:08.771 --> 01:27:10.506
You're not a loser.

01:27:10.606 --> 01:27:12.800
Don't be ridiculous.

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:15.553
You know, I just come home
and I'm alone,

01:27:15.653 --> 01:27:18.473
and my marriage
is falling apart.

01:27:18.573 --> 01:27:21.476
Just--
Elliot slipping away from me.

01:27:21.576 --> 01:27:26.272
I feel like I'm burned out
from work and I...

01:27:26.372 --> 01:27:28.914
You are a strong woman,
Martha.

01:27:32.503 --> 01:27:34.322
Not really, Pop.

01:27:34.422 --> 01:27:35.907
You are.

01:27:36.007 --> 01:27:37.923
You take after me.

01:27:39.552 --> 01:27:41.302
No, I take after Mama.

01:27:45.725 --> 01:27:47.502
Your mother and I
always talked

01:27:47.602 --> 01:27:50.421
about you and Denise.

01:27:50.521 --> 01:27:52.965
How you two turned out,

01:27:53.065 --> 01:27:55.468
best thing we ever did.

01:27:55.568 --> 01:27:57.220
Yeah, well, me and Denise
have been making up

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.361
for Buddy
our entire lives.

01:28:01.949 --> 01:28:04.394
I'm gonna get
supper started.

01:28:04.494 --> 01:28:06.354
You sure you wanna cook?

01:28:06.454 --> 01:28:07.897
I'm happy to take us out.

01:28:07.997 --> 01:28:09.774
No, I'm making
your favorite spaghetti,

01:28:09.874 --> 01:28:10.858
Mom's recipe.

01:28:10.958 --> 01:28:12.360
Oh, that sounds good.

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.960
But I want you
to set the table.

01:28:17.298 --> 01:28:19.173
All right.

01:28:38.152 --> 01:28:39.554
And Your Honor,
the children's father

01:28:39.654 --> 01:28:41.264
has submitted an affidavit

01:28:41.364 --> 01:28:42.765
stating his desire

01:28:42.865 --> 01:28:45.935
that Ms. Diaz
have sole custody.

01:28:46.035 --> 01:28:48.104
From our findings,
we concur

01:28:48.204 --> 01:28:49.731
and we think the children

01:28:49.831 --> 01:28:51.274
should be returned to home
as soon as possible.

01:28:51.374 --> 01:28:53.067
And when might that be?

01:28:53.167 --> 01:28:54.527
I think that we can
clear up this paperwork

01:28:54.627 --> 01:28:56.904
-by tomorrow.
-Well, so be it.

01:28:57.004 --> 01:28:58.990
Ms. Diaz, please stand

01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:01.909
or should I call you
Sara today?

01:29:02.009 --> 01:29:04.203
 Fine, if it means I never have
to come back here again.

01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:06.873
Well, it's my sincere hope

01:29:06.973 --> 01:29:10.418
that you never step foot
in this courtroom again.

01:29:10.518 --> 01:29:13.337
I know that this has been
a long process for you,

01:29:13.437 --> 01:29:14.756
but when it comes
to the best interest

01:29:14.856 --> 01:29:16.716
of the children
who come before this court,

01:29:16.816 --> 01:29:19.343
we always err
on the side of caution.

01:29:19.443 --> 01:29:22.054
I'm very pleased to get
David and Tia back home

01:29:22.154 --> 01:29:23.946
to you,
and I wish you well.

01:29:26.158 --> 01:29:28.811
Is there something
you wanna say?

01:29:28.911 --> 01:29:31.105
Yes, but if I do,

01:29:31.205 --> 01:29:32.356
are you gonna change
your mind?

01:29:32.456 --> 01:29:34.123
No, of course not.

01:29:39.338 --> 01:29:41.741
It's nice
you're wishing me well,

01:29:41.841 --> 01:29:42.992
but I have been
without my kids

01:29:43.092 --> 01:29:44.786
for over three months,

01:29:44.886 --> 01:29:46.078
and from day one,
their lawyer say

01:29:46.178 --> 01:29:48.206
they wanted
to come home with me.

01:29:48.306 --> 01:29:51.626
So, when you're talking
about their best interest,

01:29:51.726 --> 01:29:55.379
I don't think
this was good for them.

01:29:55.479 --> 01:29:57.423
I also think there are plenty
of rich people

01:29:57.523 --> 01:29:59.592
who drink themselves silly
and ignore their children.

01:29:59.692 --> 01:30:02.303
They don't even discipline
their children,

01:30:02.403 --> 01:30:03.638
and I don't see
any of those people

01:30:03.738 --> 01:30:05.890
sitting out there
waiting for hours

01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:09.185
because someone accused them
of being a bad parent.

01:30:09.285 --> 01:30:10.910
Nobody's taking
their kids away.

01:30:12.914 --> 01:30:14.315
And yes,

01:30:14.415 --> 01:30:16.165
I am very happy
to have my kids home.

01:30:18.252 --> 01:30:19.654
But now
I have to figure out

01:30:19.754 --> 01:30:20.863
how I'm gonna make up
all the hours

01:30:20.963 --> 01:30:22.448
I missed at work
to be here

01:30:22.548 --> 01:30:25.868
so I can support them.

01:30:25.968 --> 01:30:28.955
And I have to let
my scared little girl know

01:30:29.055 --> 01:30:32.458
that no one's taking her
from her mom again,

01:30:32.558 --> 01:30:34.001
and I got to let
my boy know

01:30:34.101 --> 01:30:35.392
that all of this
wasn't his fault.

01:30:37.813 --> 01:30:40.314
So, maybe this is ending
for you, but...

01:30:41.776 --> 01:30:44.178
it's not over for me.

01:30:44.278 --> 01:30:45.861
That's all I wanna say.

01:30:53.162 --> 01:30:54.313
I'm not gonna get
into a debate

01:30:54.413 --> 01:30:57.108
with you, Ms. Diaz.

01:30:57.208 --> 01:31:01.404
But if you believe
you share no responsibility

01:31:01.504 --> 01:31:02.822
in the events
that brought you

01:31:02.922 --> 01:31:06.617
to this courtroom,
you are mistaken.

01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:09.370
Some children are not
so fortunate as yours,

01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:10.746
some children
whose cases pass

01:31:10.846 --> 01:31:13.082
before this court
never make it.

01:31:13.182 --> 01:31:16.544
And those of us who work here
and work very conscientiously

01:31:16.644 --> 01:31:18.462
and very hard,
I might add,

01:31:18.562 --> 01:31:20.047
are haunted by the fact
every single day.

01:31:20.147 --> 01:31:22.675
We step foot in this room,

01:31:22.775 --> 01:31:25.094
and I would always go to err
on the side prudence and time

01:31:25.194 --> 01:31:26.637
because at the end
of the day,

01:31:26.737 --> 01:31:27.972
it is a far
lesser price to pay

01:31:28.072 --> 01:31:31.183
than that of a young life.

01:31:31.283 --> 01:31:33.436
I can sympathize
with what you've been through

01:31:33.536 --> 01:31:34.812
and it might be good
of you

01:31:34.912 --> 01:31:37.356
to understand
our position as well.

01:31:37.456 --> 01:31:38.816
Well, maybe so,

01:31:38.916 --> 01:31:40.026
but your position
is always gonna be

01:31:40.126 --> 01:31:41.652
sitting up there,

01:31:41.752 --> 01:31:44.363
looking down at all of us,

01:31:44.463 --> 01:31:46.073
people you know
nothing about.

01:31:46.173 --> 01:31:47.700
If you have a problem
with me sitting up here,

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.993
you can take it up
with the mayor's office

01:31:49.093 --> 01:31:51.203
before they reappoint me.

01:31:51.303 --> 01:31:52.747
And I don't presume
to know

01:31:52.847 --> 01:31:54.582
you'd be on the confines
of this courtroom,

01:31:54.682 --> 01:31:56.208
but I can assure you,
you don't know anything

01:31:56.308 --> 01:31:58.044
about us either.

01:31:58.144 --> 01:31:59.462
Those of us who work here,

01:31:59.562 --> 01:32:00.963
all of us do it
because we believe

01:32:01.063 --> 01:32:02.715
in what we're doing.

01:32:02.815 --> 01:32:05.051
Lord knows we're not doing it
for the money.

01:32:05.151 --> 01:32:07.553
So, go home,
kiss your kids,

01:32:07.653 --> 01:32:09.221
it might not look like it now

01:32:09.321 --> 01:32:11.015
but you're actually
one of our few stories

01:32:11.115 --> 01:32:12.948
with a happy ending.

01:32:14.702 --> 01:32:16.646
We're done here.

01:32:16.746 --> 01:32:17.980
Thank you, everyone.

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.788
Clear the court.

01:32:49.028 --> 01:32:50.819
What are you doing outside?
It's freezing.

01:32:53.657 --> 01:32:54.823
What's that?

01:32:56.243 --> 01:32:57.812
What does it look like?

01:32:57.912 --> 01:33:00.147
You've never seen
a Christmas tree before?

01:33:00.247 --> 01:33:01.830
I need some help
taking it upstairs.

01:33:04.251 --> 01:33:05.459
Help me.

01:33:08.005 --> 01:33:09.922
What are you smoking for?
It's just plain stupid.

01:33:15.096 --> 01:33:16.330
And if you dare have my boy

01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:17.540
 to one of your little parties,
Anthony,

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.458
I swear I'm calling the cops.

01:33:19.558 --> 01:33:20.918
I'm moving to my aunt's.

01:33:21.018 --> 01:33:22.434
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:33:23.854 --> 01:33:24.895
Really? How come?

01:33:27.399 --> 01:33:28.440
Reasons.

01:33:30.111 --> 01:33:31.345
Are you okay with that?

01:33:31.445 --> 01:33:33.889
Like I got a say.

01:33:33.989 --> 01:33:35.975
You gonna miss me?

01:33:36.075 --> 01:33:38.519
Are you ever gonna stop
being a wiseass, Anthony?

01:33:38.619 --> 01:33:39.854
Jesus.

01:33:39.954 --> 01:33:41.981
Okay, go.

01:33:42.081 --> 01:33:43.705
Wait, okay.

01:33:45.251 --> 01:33:46.500
Just one more flight.

01:33:50.005 --> 01:33:51.365
You're gonna decorate this tree?

01:33:51.465 --> 01:33:52.700
Yeah,

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.258
with my kids.

01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:01.098
I got some lights
for the windows.

01:34:02.601 --> 01:34:04.795
You wanna help me?

01:34:04.895 --> 01:34:07.298
-I guess.
-No, Anthony, no guessing.

01:34:07.398 --> 01:34:09.022
Yes or no?

01:34:10.693 --> 01:34:11.693
Yeah.

01:34:13.195 --> 01:34:15.988
Okay, hold this.

01:34:18.159 --> 01:34:19.560
- You want a drink?
--Yes.

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:22.104
- I'm good.
-You're good? Okay.

01:34:22.204 --> 01:34:23.204
Happy Holidays,
Ms. Fisher.

01:34:24.957 --> 01:34:27.359
Mr. Denholz, you cleaned up
for the occasion.

01:34:27.459 --> 01:34:28.903
Yes, I bought this suit
about a week ago.

01:34:29.003 --> 01:34:30.780
I got a wedding to attend

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.866
and thought I'd give
the collar's threads a rest.

01:34:33.966 --> 01:34:35.576
Understood.

01:34:35.676 --> 01:34:37.078
Ms. Fisher,

01:34:37.178 --> 01:34:40.956
let me put my cards out
on the table, okay?

01:34:41.056 --> 01:34:42.833
Do I have a shot
at a date with you?

01:34:42.933 --> 01:34:43.933
No.

01:34:45.186 --> 01:34:46.921
Ouch. Okay.

01:34:47.021 --> 01:34:48.422
Let me leave you
with this thought.

01:34:48.522 --> 01:34:50.925
I am smart as anyone
you're ever gonna date,

01:34:51.025 --> 01:34:52.551
and I-- And I have
a good heart,

01:34:52.651 --> 01:34:54.220
and I know
at least two women

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.222
that think
I'm an excellent kisser.

01:34:56.322 --> 01:34:57.723
And for the record,

01:34:57.823 --> 01:34:59.683
I am from Brooklyn,
Flatbush,

01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:02.144
11234 to the core.

01:35:02.244 --> 01:35:04.786
I'm not that faux hipster
Williamsburg bullshit.

01:35:06.498 --> 01:35:08.025
Good, I feel good
about this.

01:35:08.125 --> 01:35:09.860
Why don't you mull over
what we talked about here

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.862
and get back to me,
Ms. Fisher.

01:35:11.962 --> 01:35:14.615
Don't close any doors.

01:35:14.715 --> 01:35:16.784
I'm not gonna date anybody
I work with,

01:35:16.884 --> 01:35:19.120
but I must say, you've got
certain charms about you

01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:23.082
after a couple of eggnogs,
Mr. Denholz.

01:35:23.182 --> 01:35:25.042
-Happy Holidays.
-Happy Holidays, thank you,

01:35:25.142 --> 01:35:28.129
that's-- Ms. Dunbar,

01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:30.520
let me put my cards out
on the table.

01:35:32.775 --> 01:35:35.302
Judges, is that how
I'm supposed to address you?

01:35:35.402 --> 01:35:37.805
This is my first
social gathering

01:35:37.905 --> 01:35:39.306
in mixed company.

01:35:39.406 --> 01:35:40.975
Tonight, it's just--
It's Mark.

01:35:41.075 --> 01:35:43.227
Don't you just love
the Christmas party?

01:35:43.327 --> 01:35:44.895
It's very festive.

01:35:44.995 --> 01:35:46.772
It's always fun
to see colleagues

01:35:46.872 --> 01:35:48.983
out of uniform
in a good Christmas sweater

01:35:49.083 --> 01:35:50.624
with a few eggnogs,
you know.

01:35:53.295 --> 01:35:56.115
So, how are you enjoying
working here?

01:35:56.215 --> 01:35:59.785
I don't know if enjoy
is the word that I would use.

01:35:59.885 --> 01:36:01.036
It's been challenging.

01:36:01.136 --> 01:36:03.706
Well, you certainly knew what
you were getting yourself into.

01:36:03.806 --> 01:36:05.708
Of course,
but how do you keep

01:36:05.808 --> 01:36:07.501
from taking these stories home

01:36:07.601 --> 01:36:09.587
with you at night?

01:36:09.687 --> 01:36:10.921
Well, if you're lucky,

01:36:11.021 --> 01:36:12.882
you'll learn to just
leave it behind.

01:36:12.982 --> 01:36:14.550
I read
a lot of trashy novels.

01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:16.760
It helps me
to compartmentalize.

01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:19.722
-Really?
-God bless chick flick.

01:36:19.822 --> 01:36:21.515
-Happy Holidays.
-Cheers.

01:36:21.615 --> 01:36:24.018
Enjoy the party,
Ms. Fisher.

01:36:24.118 --> 01:36:26.395
I think I'm just still
on the fence about her.

01:36:28.289 --> 01:36:29.899
Do you want another drink?

01:36:29.999 --> 01:36:32.193
Yeah, I'm gonna get you
a club soda.

01:36:32.293 --> 01:36:34.486
-Club soda?
-Yeah, Martha,

01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:36.878
a club soda.

01:37:03.365 --> 01:37:05.100
 Come on, Mom.

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.436
 -Come on.
-- Come on.

01:37:07.536 --> 01:37:10.056
Oh, my gosh.

01:37:10.956 --> 01:37:12.775
That's snow deep.

01:37:12.875 --> 01:37:14.902
Wow, I can't wait to go home.

01:37:16.253 --> 01:37:17.913
I can't wait to go to sleep

01:37:18.013 --> 01:37:19.657
in my own bed.

01:37:20.057 --> 01:37:22.618
Heater hopefully works again.

01:37:22.718 --> 01:37:23.961
Yes.
- I got it, I got it.

01:37:24.061 --> 01:37:25.802
-Okay.
-I got the door.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.500
