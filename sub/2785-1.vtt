<i>Live from WZIL</i>,
News 25 <i>at noon starts now.</i>

00:25.341 --> 00:28.277
<i>Colin Evans, convicted of
voluntary manslaughter</i>

00:28.377 --> 00:32.731
<i>for one of the most brutal murders in
recent history, is up for parole today.</i>

00:33.641 --> 00:38.687
<i>Five years ago, Evans was one of the
most wanted men in state history,</i>

00:38.787 --> 00:43.772
<i>having emerged as the prime suspect in
the disappearance of five young women.</i>

00:43.872 --> 00:46.670
<i>Evans was eventually
apprehended for the crimes,</i>

00:46.770 --> 00:50.750
<i>only to escape and elude
authorities for several months,</i>

00:50.850 --> 00:54.528
<i>until the night he was arrested
for the fatal barroom brawl</i>

00:54.628 --> 00:57.506
<i>that would lead to his
manslaughter conviction.</i>

00:57.881 --> 01:00.251
<i>The evidence necessary to try Evans</i>

01:00.351 --> 01:04.321
<i>for the abduction of the five
young women proved illusory.</i>

01:04.421 --> 01:09.393
<i>The DA's office decided to settle for what
it knew it could prove in a court of law.</i>

01:09.893 --> 01:13.088
<i>Hence, the lesser
manslaughter conviction.</i>

01:13.889 --> 01:16.767
<i>No mention of Evans being
the primary suspect</i>

01:16.867 --> 01:20.629
<i>in the disappearance and presumed
death of the five young women</i>

01:20.729 --> 01:23.223
<i>was ever made at his manslaughter trial.</i>

01:24.007 --> 01:27.011
<i>But now, on a day when one
of the most feared men</i>

01:27.111 --> 01:30.097
<i>in the annals of state
history might walk</i>

01:30.197 --> 01:34.018
<i>after having served only five
years in prison for manslaughter,</i>

01:34.118 --> 01:39.023
<i>the five families are huddled together
outside the courthouse hoping and praying</i>

01:39.123 --> 01:42.723
<i>that the man they believe to be
nothing more than a vicious animal,</i>

01:42.823 --> 01:44.921
<i>is not set free.</i>

01:47.773 --> 01:50.205
I'm hoping you get a
fair shake today, Colin.

01:50.305 --> 01:52.786
- I prayed hard for it Sunday.
- I appreciate that.

01:52.886 --> 01:56.265
In my experience, if you
give a man a second chance,

01:56.365 --> 01:59.502
usually, they rise to the occasion.
Well, except politicians.

01:59.602 --> 02:01.887
I've never met one of them ever
learned from their mistakes.

02:01.987 --> 02:06.709
What about you, Officer Reid?
Can I count on your support?

02:07.109 --> 02:10.262
They pay me to guard you,
not to talk to you.

02:10.362 --> 02:12.956
Don't mind him, Colin.
He's got woman troubles.

02:13.674 --> 02:15.442
You know how that goes.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.363
Yeah.

02:20.331 --> 02:25.402
<i>Colin Evans, currently serving 10 to
15 years for involuntary manslaughter.</i>

02:25.502 --> 02:29.289
<i>Let the record show you've requested
to address the parole board</i>

02:29.389 --> 02:31.934
<i>in lieu of your attorney. You may begin.</i>

02:32.117 --> 02:33.618
Thank you, sir.

02:35.220 --> 02:39.608
I'm not going to stand here and lie to you,
because I'm not very good at that.

02:40.935 --> 02:44.313
When I was sentenced, I was angry.

02:44.605 --> 02:47.751
I told myself fights like this
get out of hand all the time.

02:47.851 --> 02:51.245
Accidents happen and I could have easily
been the man that died that night.

02:52.363 --> 02:56.542
But as time went by, I realized I was wrong.
I shouldn't have been angry.

02:57.576 --> 02:59.186
I should have been ashamed.

02:59.286 --> 03:03.707
A man had died, and there was
no way I could bring him back.

03:05.668 --> 03:09.121
But I could make a change within myself.

03:09.421 --> 03:11.306
And others, perhaps.

03:11.924 --> 03:16.495
I started a teaching program,
teaching other prisoners to read and write.

03:16.595 --> 03:18.264
And the warden saw this,

03:18.364 --> 03:22.109
and they're talking about taking my
program statewide to other prisons.

03:22.434 --> 03:25.012
I feel like that's an achievement.

03:29.733 --> 03:33.696
I stand here right now as
a changed, humble man.

03:34.738 --> 03:39.176
I've been in the prison correctional
system for five years now,

03:39.276 --> 03:42.754
and that is exactly
what I am, corrected.

03:43.205 --> 03:45.040
Rehabilitated.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.577
I just wanted you to give me a chance.

03:51.530 --> 03:52.664
I won't let you down.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.251
Thank you for your time.

03:59.847 --> 04:02.391
Mr. Chairman, if I could
have just a moment?

04:02.491 --> 04:04.126
Go ahead.

04:04.226 --> 04:07.137
You see, I did my homework on this man.

04:08.897 --> 04:14.369
And I can tell you with confidence
that he's actually quite a good liar.

04:14.737 --> 04:17.079
That fight that got out of hand,

04:17.322 --> 04:20.608
that was actually Mr. Evans
flying into a murderous rage

04:20.709 --> 04:23.771
because of how the victim
was looking at his girlfriend.

04:23.871 --> 04:27.282
And as a younger man,
there were other acts of violence,

04:27.382 --> 04:30.194
frequently involving the
attentions of a woman.

04:30.494 --> 04:34.640
Mr. Evans fits the criteria
of a malignant narcissist.

04:35.549 --> 04:40.479
Charming, highly intelligent,
as you've witnessed,

04:41.305 --> 04:46.401
but malignant narcissists are
compelled to prove their superiority.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.298
Everything's a seduction,
and if they're rejected,

04:50.398 --> 04:54.952
or things don't go their way,
they lose control.

04:55.444 --> 04:59.014
Some other more well-known
malignant narcissists were

04:59.114 --> 05:02.184
Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy...

05:02.284 --> 05:04.979
Now, hold on. No. Sir. Sir.

05:05.079 --> 05:08.457
Mr. Evans, please, just sit down.

05:08.749 --> 05:11.518
Please sit down, Mr. Evans.

05:13.837 --> 05:16.448
I can tell you there's
violence in this man.

05:16.548 --> 05:20.678
And his control over himself is slender.

05:20.878 --> 05:23.906
I'll let my fellow board members
make up their own minds,

05:24.006 --> 05:26.284
but there are five families outside

05:26.384 --> 05:31.130
who are hoping and praying that
we do not set Colin Evans free.

05:31.230 --> 05:35.550
Mr. Evans, as I'm sure you're aware,
to be granted parole

05:35.778 --> 05:39.555
in the state of Tennessee,
it must be a unanimous vote.

05:39.655 --> 05:43.417
We'll take this up again in
five years, as mandated.

05:46.478 --> 05:50.265
Ladies and gentlemen, that convenes the
state of Tennessee parole hearing for today.

05:50.365 --> 05:52.601
Madame Secretary, you can turn
off your recording devices.

05:52.701 --> 05:54.303
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are free to go at this time.

06:25.367 --> 06:28.587
- I don't know what to say, Colin.
- Why even waste your breath?

06:31.165 --> 06:33.417
A little help. My nose is bleeding.

06:33.517 --> 06:36.070
- Reid.
- He'll be fine.

06:36.170 --> 06:38.222
Give him a tissue or something.

06:45.852 --> 06:46.905
Here.

06:54.422 --> 06:56.857
- Shit! No!
- No, no, put the gun down!

06:56.957 --> 06:58.759
Or you can watch him die
and I don't want that!

06:58.859 --> 07:00.486
- No!
- You don't want that.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.789
Put the gun down and you
both walk out of here!

07:04.323 --> 07:07.334
Come on. I just want to
get out of here, that's all.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.880
- Colin, please.
- You have my word.

07:13.323 --> 07:14.675
Go on.

07:17.169 --> 07:21.014
Come on. Just put it down.
Just put it down!

07:54.698 --> 07:58.903
Yes, I'm still here. Yeah.
Ryan, honey, please don't do that.

07:59.003 --> 08:01.930
Yeah, can you please tell me
how long ago my husband left?

08:02.498 --> 08:06.435
Ryan, stop it. Yeah. Javier, one second.

08:06.969 --> 08:09.705
Yeah, well, if he checks in,
can you please have him call me?

08:09.805 --> 08:14.118
Yeah. Thanks, Karen.
Okay. Bye-bye. What's up?

08:14.218 --> 08:17.955
- There's a storm coming.
- Is everything gonna be okay out there?

08:18.055 --> 08:21.351
I covered the concrete with plastic.
It will delay the dry-time a little, but...

08:21.451 --> 08:25.246
Ryan, paint Mommy a picture.
Please, go make me a picture. Go ahead.

08:25.346 --> 08:27.289
Come on. Go get your coloring book.

08:27.740 --> 08:31.627
With the storm coming,
there's really not much we can do.

08:38.417 --> 08:41.453
Hey, Javier. The house is looking great.

08:41.553 --> 08:43.938
- It's getting there. Have a good weekend.
- You, too. Bye.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.157
All right, let's go, guys. Load it up!

08:45.257 --> 08:46.277
Terry?

08:46.377 --> 08:47.910
- Hey!
- Hey!

08:48.010 --> 08:51.080
- When are they going to be done?
- Last month.

08:51.180 --> 08:53.065
Maybe I should remodel.

08:54.558 --> 08:58.328
Who's got the prettiest
goddaughter in the whole world?

08:58.428 --> 08:59.463
You!

08:59.563 --> 09:02.024
- And who's Meg's best friend?
- Ryan.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.859
- And who's Ryan's best friend?
- Meg.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.028
- And what's all the rest?
- Bullshit!

09:06.128 --> 09:08.406
Meg. Yeah, you're going to school

09:08.506 --> 09:11.467
the first time she gets called to
the principal's office, not me.

09:11.567 --> 09:15.855
- What's he look like, and is he single?
- You are a mess, but you look good.

09:15.955 --> 09:16.981
Thanks. So do you.

09:17.081 --> 09:22.194
Yeah, covered in spit-up and carrying
an extra 10 pounds, but thanks.

09:22.294 --> 09:25.739
Do you know what I think? I think you're not
the reason you feel bad about yourself.

09:25.839 --> 09:29.952
I think that Jeffrey should be making
you feel appreciated and he should...

09:30.052 --> 09:33.597
Jeffrey makes me feel appreciated, okay?
He appreciates me.

09:33.697 --> 09:35.857
- I am just saying... Okay.
- Thanks for your concern.

09:38.477 --> 09:41.130
Daddy! Daddy!

09:41.230 --> 09:43.549
Hey, sweetheart.

09:43.949 --> 09:46.068
- Jeffrey's home early.
- I forgot to tell you.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.371
It's his dad's birthday, so,
he's taking him on a golf trip.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.643
Okay. You know what?
We're going to have a girls' night.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.162
- I'm going to get some wine.
- Great.

09:57.262 --> 10:00.691
- My girl needs a girls' night.
- We're going to get drunk!

10:02.100 --> 10:04.712
I can't wait. Hey, Jeffrey.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.631
Hey, Meg. What are the two of you up to?

10:07.731 --> 10:11.252
You know, just braiding each other's
hair and talking about the boys we like.

10:11.352 --> 10:13.220
Meg stopped by on her run.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.180
Which I should probably get back to,
so, I'll see you tonight?

10:15.280 --> 10:18.875
- Yes, I can't wait.
- Jeffrey, you're a lucky man.

10:20.177 --> 10:21.395
Yes, I am.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.272
- See you later, Meg.
- Bye, honey.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.482
- Hi.
- Hello, darling.

10:26.017 --> 10:28.135
Damn, baby.

10:28.477 --> 10:31.572
I was feeding your children.
Can you try not to act so grossed out?

10:31.672 --> 10:35.159
I'm sorry. It's just this Hopkins
case is turning into a nightmare.

10:35.259 --> 10:39.188
- The judge rejected our plea today.
- I am sorry to hear that.

10:40.464 --> 10:42.499
That's life, right?

10:44.293 --> 10:46.462
I saw that Meg sold that
house down by the school.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.698
- She must be making a killing.
- Meg has quite the life.

10:51.208 --> 10:54.303
Here we go. I'm home two minutes
and you're already being negative.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.222
- All I said was that Meg had the life.
- And you don't?

10:57.322 --> 10:58.307
Jeffrey, I...

10:58.407 --> 11:00.893
Babe, just remember it was your
idea to be a full-time mom.

11:00.993 --> 11:05.630
- This is what you wanted, not me.
- Yes, it is what I wanted, Jeffrey.

11:06.790 --> 11:09.652
I hardly saw you all week
and I'm going to miss you.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.988
I know. I'm sorry. Okay?

11:13.088 --> 11:16.790
Let's get away. Okay?
Just you and me. Without the kids.

11:16.890 --> 11:22.748
Somewhere for a couple of days.
We need it. It's been a long time. Okay?

11:22.848 --> 11:26.309
All right. We can do that.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.908
I'm going to the store.

11:33.108 --> 11:35.494
That way, you can spend some time
with the kids before you leave.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.639
No, wait a minute. No, no. I'm already
running late and I still got to pack.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.792
Jeffrey. That's why I asked
you to be home early.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.919
It's my dad's birthday.

11:45.954 --> 11:48.115
I'm going to go pack.

12:40.884 --> 12:45.039
You're not taking your big, warm coat?
It's going to be cold up there.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.950
It's just two hours away. I'll be fine.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.812
They say the storm is
going to be really bad.

12:51.912 --> 12:53.956
Are you sure you want to
drive all the way there?

12:54.056 --> 12:55.758
Is all this worrying because
you need me to stay?

12:55.858 --> 13:00.245
Of course not. I know how
important this is for your father.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.040
I better get going.

13:03.340 --> 13:04.975
Tell your dad I said, "Happy birthday."

13:05.075 --> 13:08.395
I will. Make sure you use the
alarm when I'm gone, all right?

13:08.495 --> 13:11.690
I know, I know, but just use
it for my peace of mind.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.025
All right.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.761
- Do you remember the code?
- Yes. I'll use it.

13:15.861 --> 13:16.862
All right.

13:27.589 --> 13:31.252
I'll miss you. When I get
back, we'll plan that trip.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.545
Maybe, we'll go back to that
little place on the vineyard.

13:33.645 --> 13:37.024
- How does that sound?
- Great.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.965
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.836
<i>Hey, it's Renée.
I hope you're having a great day.</i>

14:13.936 --> 14:15.963
<i>Listen, we should catch up this weekend.</i>

14:16.063 --> 14:19.216
<i>I have to tell you about the
horrible date I went on last week.</i>

14:19.316 --> 14:24.213
<i>Anyway, give me a call and maybe we
can meet up for a movie or something?</i>

14:24.313 --> 14:26.748
<i>- Talk to you soon. Bye.</i>
- Honey, I'm home.

14:35.257 --> 14:37.718
- Colin...
- I just want to talk.

14:47.761 --> 14:53.025
You know, I wanted to tell you that
after what happened that night,

14:55.002 --> 14:59.998
I don't blame you for pulling away
from me. You know, moving out here.

15:02.317 --> 15:05.813
The point is, I can't do
anything about that now.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.208
When I was in prison,

15:12.828 --> 15:15.589
I thought a lot about you.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.329
What do you want from me?

15:30.429 --> 15:33.815
I just want you to forgive me.

15:34.641 --> 15:36.611
Give me a chance.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.823
I know someone that can make passports.

15:42.358 --> 15:46.929
We can get two new names.
Travel, you know?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.206
Go around the world, you and me,
like we talked about.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.130
Maybe get married.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.806
Would you come with me?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.480
I'm going to need an answer, yes or no.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.318
- Yes.
- Yes?

16:18.894 --> 16:22.031
- Do you still love me?
- Yes.

16:22.131 --> 16:24.616
Because I wrote you a lot of
letters and you ain't answer them.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.872
But that's because I
didn't know what to say.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.226
And there's no one else?

16:34.626 --> 16:36.052
- No.
- That's right.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.383
Because you still love me.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.430
Right?

16:50.459 --> 16:52.060
Is that him?

16:52.386 --> 16:55.230
- Who?
- "Who?"

16:56.932 --> 16:59.776
The guy I saw you talking
to at the coffee shop.

17:01.437 --> 17:05.074
Nice looking fellow. He and I are
going to have to have a chat later on.

17:05.174 --> 17:08.352
He's my trainer. He wanted to
talk to me about his boyfriend.

17:08.452 --> 17:11.145
His boyfriend? Do you think
I spent five years in prison

17:11.244 --> 17:14.433
for you to come and lie to me now?
Where did you meet him?

17:15.709 --> 17:19.421
You know, I found this on your bed.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.723
"Didn't want to wake you,

17:31.467 --> 17:34.436
"'cause you look so
beautiful when you sleep."

17:34.595 --> 17:36.572
Colin...

17:39.016 --> 17:41.485
- I tried to wait.
- No, you didn't.

17:45.347 --> 17:49.843
I found these, too.
You didn't even read any of these.

17:49.943 --> 17:53.455
Didn't read that one. Not one. Not one!

18:00.095 --> 18:01.230
Hey!

18:01.330 --> 18:03.924
Hey! No!

18:06.393 --> 18:07.594
Here.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.148
- Colin!
- You didn't give me a chance!

18:22.351 --> 18:23.752
You murdered a man!

18:23.852 --> 18:27.381
It's manslaughter in the eyes of the law.
It's very, very different.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.658
And those girls? What about them?

18:30.984 --> 18:33.762
- Does he even know about me?
- Who?

18:35.239 --> 18:38.392
Do you love him? Do you love him?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.227
- Leave me alone.
- Just tell me. Just tell me!

18:40.327 --> 18:41.979
- Leave me alone!
- Just answer the question!

18:42.079 --> 18:44.898
- What?
- Did you have sex in this bed?

18:44.998 --> 18:48.694
You're just being ridiculous.
It's stupid.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.805
That's what's going on?
While I'm in jail,

18:51.905 --> 18:54.733
you're sitting here having sex
with this man. Is that right?

18:54.833 --> 18:57.411
Why don't you just tell me the truth?
Why don't you just tell me?

18:57.511 --> 18:59.187
Yes! Yes, Colin!

19:00.055 --> 19:05.027
We do it right here, in this bed.
All the time! And it's great!

19:05.352 --> 19:06.695
Is that what you want to hear?

19:07.062 --> 19:11.717
Is that what I need to say to
get you to just leave me alone?

19:11.817 --> 19:14.453
Just leave me alone.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.674
I'm sorry.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.596
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.226
- I just missed you.
- It's okay.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.104
I missed you so much.

19:45.712 --> 19:46.568
I...

19:49.605 --> 19:50.906
I am done!

20:31.814 --> 20:35.250
Shit. Okay.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.925
<i>Mr. Evans fits the criteria
of a malignant narcissist.</i>

20:52.960 --> 20:56.572
<i>Some other more well-known
malignant narcissists were</i>

20:56.672 --> 20:59.016
<i>Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy...</i>

21:55.731 --> 21:57.400
Cut those up.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.131
Go ahead, cut it up
and put it on the plate.

22:18.554 --> 22:22.165
That's very good. Big girl.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.453
Okay, baby. Finish that up, okay?
I'll be right back.

22:26.553 --> 22:29.064
Okay, Mommy.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.485
You are so early.

22:36.071 --> 22:37.072
Hello?

22:38.273 --> 22:39.341
Hello?

22:41.110 --> 22:45.789
I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you.
You were the only house with the lights on.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.394
I just lost control of my car.
I skidded and wrecked it.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.522
- Are you all right?
- I'm good. I just had a scratch.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.065
Oh, my God.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.093
I'm all right. Do you think
I could use your phone?

23:00.229 --> 23:01.989
I don't even need to come in.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.683
I'll stand right here. You can
hand the phone and shut the door.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.542
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- All right, thank you.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.551
Okay, baby. I guess somebody
needs to use the phone.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.094
Okay, finish cutting that up, baby.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.888
Put it on the plate,
and then come over here and eat,

23:25.988 --> 23:28.557
because I want you in bed at
a decent hour tonight, okay?

23:28.657 --> 23:31.501
- Okay.
- All right. I'll be right back.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.463
Okay. Here.

23:36.623 --> 23:39.401
- I'll get that for you.
- You don't have to worry about that.

23:39.501 --> 23:43.572
- That's all right.
- I really can get that later.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.475
You know, the one time I
forget my cell phone...

23:47.426 --> 23:49.978
- Here.
- Thank you.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.647
Oh, boy.

23:53.340 --> 23:54.775
Do you live around here?

23:57.144 --> 24:00.280
- Yeah, over on River Road.
- Okay.

24:00.797 --> 24:02.866
- Yeah.
- Mommy!

24:05.110 --> 24:07.763
- I'm feeding my daughter. I'm sorry.
- Go on.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.716
Look, why don't you make
the call and I'll be right back?

24:10.816 --> 24:14.544
- Go on. I'll be fine.
- Okay. All right. Okay, Ryan.

24:20.334 --> 24:23.070
Ryan. I need your help, baby.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.764
I'm trying to help a neighbor.
You have to clean that up.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.909
Lord.

24:29.009 --> 24:32.354
Wait right... I'll be back, baby.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.402
Yeah, it's going to need a tow.

24:38.519 --> 24:42.381
It's totaled. Hold on.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.925
Is there anyone here that can
give me a ride to my car?

24:45.025 --> 24:48.596
They want me to sign something
before they can tow me.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.163
My husband's not home...

24:51.115 --> 24:54.209
...yet, but he should be home soon.

24:55.235 --> 24:58.439
You know what? Why don't you have them
meet you here just in case he's late?

24:58.539 --> 25:00.482
- Here?
- Yeah.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.068
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's fine.

25:03.168 --> 25:07.681
Okay. Sir, is there any way the driver
can meet me here where I am right now?

25:08.424 --> 25:09.437
Great.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.978
- I'm at...
- 17 Creston Lane.

25:13.078 --> 25:14.455
- 17...
- Creston...

25:14.555 --> 25:15.706
- Creston.
- ...Lane.

25:15.806 --> 25:19.168
- Lane. All right.
- Okay.

25:19.268 --> 25:23.564
He said he doesn't know how long it's going
to take because of the storm, but...

25:25.274 --> 25:28.302
They're on their way.
So, thank you again.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.638
- Yeah, sure.
- I appreciate it.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.990
- All right.
- Okay.

25:38.153 --> 25:39.421
You know what?

25:44.209 --> 25:46.403
- You can come in.
- I don't want to bother you.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.930
No, it's no bother. Just come on.

25:49.998 --> 25:51.183
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

25:51.283 --> 25:55.137
I can't leave you out in the rain
to bleed to death. It's fine.

25:55.237 --> 25:57.314
- You're sure?
- I'm positive.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.026
- Thank you.
- That cut's really bad.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.379
No, it's not that bad.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.965
Yeah, let me see if I
have something for that.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.242
- Stay right there. I'll be right back.
- All right.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.249
Okay.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.128
- It's really nice of you...
- Okay, there's this.

26:20.621 --> 26:24.967
...to look after a stranger

26:25.250 --> 26:27.669
on your doorstep like this.

26:28.295 --> 26:31.891
I mean, really,
you don't have to do this.

26:34.535 --> 26:38.664
Like I said, I couldn't leave you
out in the rain bleeding like that.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.875
You can dry yourself off with that.
You can come over here.

26:41.975 --> 26:45.654
This is all I have, so,
hopefully, I can patch you up.

26:46.054 --> 26:48.924
- It's a beautiful house you've got here.
- Thanks.

26:49.024 --> 26:52.285
- Let me get this for you. Thank you.
- Okay.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.972
- Do you want me to take that for you?
- No, I'll just leave it here.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.498
Okay.

26:57.967 --> 27:01.044
Okay. Let's see.

27:01.870 --> 27:05.090
Well, hello, little princess.
What's your name?

27:07.001 --> 27:08.903
This is Ryan.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.847
- I'm a superhero!
- Ryan, no hitting.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.452
That's a mean right hook you have there.
Who taught you that, your daddy?

27:16.552 --> 27:19.955
I'm so sorry. I don't know
where she's learning this from.

27:20.555 --> 27:22.393
Ryan, do me a favor. Go in the kitchen

27:22.693 --> 27:25.461
and get Mommy a wet paper towel,
so I can clean up his boo-boo.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.196
- She is so beautiful.
- Thank you.

27:28.731 --> 27:33.001
- Is that your only child?
- No. Sam's in the nursery, sleeping.

27:34.570 --> 27:39.767
You lucked out. It can be quite the zoo
around here sometimes. And trust me,

27:39.867 --> 27:44.880
I don't turn down an opportunity to
have some adult interaction these days.

27:46.022 --> 27:49.810
Thank you, baby.
Finish cleaning up your mess, okay?

27:51.211 --> 27:53.413
All right, let's see here.

27:58.927 --> 28:02.814
You must have thought I was
your husband. At the door?

28:04.391 --> 28:07.953
- Yeah, he'll be home shortly.
- Yeah, you said.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.323
So, I'm Colin.

28:13.776 --> 28:17.245
- Terry.
- Terry? Nice to meet you.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.940
Okay. That should do it.

28:28.040 --> 28:32.219
I don't think I'll put a Band-Aid on it.
It looks like it needs to breathe.

28:33.362 --> 28:36.198
Okay, bugaboo. What about <i>Spy Dogs?</i>

28:36.298 --> 28:37.975
<i>- Spy Dogs!</i>
- Yeah!

28:38.467 --> 28:40.619
Bye-bye. Watch some <i>Spy Dogs.</i>

28:40.719 --> 28:42.955
<i>- Spy Dogs.</i>
- Say, "Bye-bye."

28:43.055 --> 28:47.567
<i>Spy Dogs, Spy Dogs.</i>
Get you good and sleepy.

28:53.465 --> 28:57.386
Okay. God, that should
keep her occupied.

28:57.486 --> 29:02.066
You know what? Why don't you come in here?
I'll see if I have a dry shirt for you.

29:08.589 --> 29:10.399
You're soaking wet. Here.

29:10.499 --> 29:13.402
- Thank you.
- Hopefully, the sizes are okay.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.887
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

29:20.342 --> 29:24.204
So, your husband went to NYU?

29:24.304 --> 29:28.483
We both did, actually.
We met in law school.

29:29.504 --> 29:31.695
So, you're both lawyers?

29:31.895 --> 29:37.117
Yeah. I was a prosecutor
at the DA's office.

29:39.361 --> 29:42.456
- That's fascinating.
- It was.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.101
Well, most of my cases were
violence against women.

29:46.201 --> 29:49.205
- They're easier to make.
- Why is that?

29:49.305 --> 29:52.942
Well, it's almost always
someone close to the victim.

29:53.042 --> 29:56.094
- Husband, boyfriend.
- They beat them?

29:56.378 --> 30:00.349
They kill them. I worked
in the homicide division.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.852
I bet you were a force to
be reckoned with, though.

30:04.970 --> 30:08.924
That's the nicest thing anyone
has said to me in a long time.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.206
Come here.

30:12.695 --> 30:14.663
There you go. Got it.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.744
- Give me your shirt. I can dry that for you.
- Right. Okay.

30:21.236 --> 30:25.540
- It helped that the men made my job easy.
- How come?

30:25.657 --> 30:30.604
Unlike what you see on TV,
most killers aren't that smart or clever.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.547
Actually, they're pretty pathetic.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.676
- Pathetic?
- Yeah, they're weak.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.679
Shit, that's going to wake Sam.

31:03.779 --> 31:07.182
- Is everything all right?
- No. It's not working.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.685
- It does this sometimes.
- Do you want me to take a look?

31:09.785 --> 31:11.223
Do you mind?

31:11.323 --> 31:14.216
- You got a...
- Yeah, just grab that coat right there.

31:17.492 --> 31:19.386
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

31:34.685 --> 31:36.695
Alarm. Alarm.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.715
- It's loud!
- Yes!

31:39.815 --> 31:43.552
It says there's a valet button
underneath the steering wheel.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.180
- Wait. I think I know where that is.
- You know where it is?

31:46.280 --> 31:48.457
- That's not it.
- What now?

31:48.949 --> 31:50.709
We need to do something else.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.423
- What did you do?
- I have no idea.

32:04.148 --> 32:05.741
That was bizarre.

32:05.841 --> 32:10.145
I don't know. Maybe it was a fuse.
Something's gone wrong.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.315
Let me lock this.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.418
Do you want some hot tea?

32:16.518 --> 32:18.487
- Sure.
- Okay.

32:42.167 --> 32:45.447
- Did you get lost?
- No.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.817
I'm just drying off.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.826
- Is this your husband?
- Yeah.

32:57.926 --> 33:00.696
- Nice.
- What about you? Are you married?

33:03.232 --> 33:04.574
Girlfriend?

33:07.903 --> 33:10.598
- Ex-fiancée.
- I'm sorry.

33:10.698 --> 33:13.250
Yeah. It just happened.

33:13.951 --> 33:17.963
- Sugar? Fresh lemon?
- She was cheating on me.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.881
That's got to hurt.

33:20.541 --> 33:23.385
The knowing is the tough part.

33:24.044 --> 33:28.015
The act itself, well, that's going to
happen whether you know about it or not.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.827
The only way to stop it is to know more.

33:31.927 --> 33:35.897
So, you want to know who he was,
what he was wearing, what he was driving.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.876
It sounds like torture.

33:38.976 --> 33:43.864
No, it's worse. It's like getting
your heart ripped out of your chest.

33:47.067 --> 33:50.912
Yeah, but at least you know.
Isn't that better?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.499
No.

33:55.159 --> 33:59.755
- We were going to get married.
- I can tell you, marriage is not all that.

34:00.831 --> 34:03.967
- Do you still love him?
- Of course.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.889
I guess I just miss my own fire.
Does that make sense?

34:09.172 --> 34:10.532
Yeah.

34:10.632 --> 34:14.427
When we met, I was independent,

34:15.179 --> 34:18.165
strong, and powerful.

34:21.185 --> 34:24.071
I just think he sees me differently now.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.929
He's just gone blind, that's all.

34:33.030 --> 34:37.417
Because you're
still beautiful, powerful,

34:38.327 --> 34:39.920
fierce.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.467
Yeah.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.838
I'm going to go put Ryan to sleep.

34:51.507 --> 34:55.351
- Can I use the restroom?
- It's this way.

35:09.592 --> 35:11.844
- Night-night, bugaboo.
- Night-night.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.620
Okay.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.234
You scared me.

36:34.318 --> 36:37.921
- Is everything okay?
- I couldn't find the sugar.

36:41.075 --> 36:42.751
I offered you sugar.

36:43.610 --> 36:45.462
Are you looking for your husband?

36:49.892 --> 36:51.468
I feel silly.

36:53.629 --> 36:57.541
- He's not coming home.
- He's not what?

37:01.345 --> 37:03.605
The tow truck's here.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.640
- Hey!
- Hey.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.184
- Did you walk?
- It's just down the street. I'm fine.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.020
Crazy lady, give me that coat.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.855
- You're soaking...
- I know.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.923
- Here. Give me the coat.
- Sorry.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.926
Look, I meant to call
you because I have...

37:34.128 --> 37:35.512
- What?
- Hi.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.784
Hi. And who are you?

37:41.084 --> 37:42.937
- I'm Colin.
- That's why I wanted to call you.

37:43.037 --> 37:47.875
Colin got into an accident and I was
the first house that he stumbled upon,

37:47.975 --> 37:49.543
and he needed to use the phone.

37:49.643 --> 37:52.129
So, he called a tow truck and we're
just waiting for the tow truck.

37:52.229 --> 37:54.798
- We're waiting.
- You don't have your own cell phone?

37:54.898 --> 37:56.533
I left it at home.

37:58.652 --> 38:01.639
That cut's pretty nasty.
Are you all right?

38:01.739 --> 38:04.433
No, I'm good.
Terry's been looking after me.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.060
- I'm sure she has.
- Stop it.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.020
She's a good little nurse, isn't she?

38:08.120 --> 38:11.607
Well, listen, I thought we were
going to have a girls' night,

38:11.707 --> 38:14.735
but I suppose we can all share.

38:14.835 --> 38:17.187
Yeah, sure. I'll get glasses.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.910
- Meg.
- Meg. Colin.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.519
- So you said.
- Right.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.755
You know,

38:27.890 --> 38:29.733
it's funny.

38:30.059 --> 38:32.503
I thought I knew all the good
looking men in this town.

38:32.603 --> 38:36.090
- I bet you do.
- Well, obviously not.

38:36.190 --> 38:38.634
- Now, where do you live?
- River Road.

38:38.734 --> 38:41.578
Hey, I just sold a house there.

38:42.196 --> 38:44.706
- I'm a realtor.
- Really?

38:45.532 --> 38:48.435
Yeah, 6267. It's an old Georgian.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.796
It was a horrible shade of brown.
The new owners just painted.

38:50.896 --> 38:54.024
Do you know the one? Do you know
the one that I'm talking about?

38:54.124 --> 38:56.360
- The new owners just painted.
- Nope.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.572
- No, I don't think I've seen that one.
- I know all the families on that street.

38:59.772 --> 39:00.973
What's your address?

39:01.924 --> 39:04.702
- Come on. What is it?
- My address?

39:04.802 --> 39:06.228
Yeah, which house are you in?

39:07.262 --> 39:10.866
- Are you going to stalk me?
- You should be so lucky.

39:11.475 --> 39:13.568
Yeah, I think I should stalk you.

39:14.103 --> 39:17.006
Now, seriously, where do you live?

39:17.106 --> 39:18.473
I...

39:20.150 --> 39:21.635
What happened?

39:21.735 --> 39:24.513
- Terry, are you okay? What happened?
- God, that scared the hell out of me.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.640
- Look at that.
- You got garbage bags?

39:26.740 --> 39:28.892
- Duct tape? Garbage bags?
- What? Yeah, everything's in there.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.186
Do you believe that?
That was such a freak accident.

39:31.286 --> 39:35.148
No, I'm fine, but that
scared the shit out of me.

39:36.250 --> 39:39.361
- Jeffrey's not going to be happy.
- No, he's not.

39:39.461 --> 39:42.990
- It's just a broken branch. There you go.
- I need a drink.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.892
Jeffrey's not going to like that.

39:48.137 --> 39:51.565
- Colin, you're so handy.
- I've fixed a couple of windows before.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.318
Stop it.

39:54.768 --> 39:57.212
- Come on.
- This is for you.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.714
Thank you.

39:58.814 --> 40:00.716
- To Terry.
- Me?

40:00.816 --> 40:04.033
A great friend, a great mom,

40:04.433 --> 40:06.155
- and a great wife...
- Thank you.

40:06.255 --> 40:08.474
- ...who Jeffrey doesn't deserve.
- Meg.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.459
To Terry.

40:11.518 --> 40:12.544
Cheers.

40:23.839 --> 40:25.807
You were thirsty.

40:26.008 --> 40:28.577
Come on, let's go in the living room.
Bring the bottle.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.747
- Come on. I'll give you some more.
- Meg.

40:31.847 --> 40:35.793
- Exactly what I needed.
- A definite step up from tea, huh?

40:35.893 --> 40:39.154
- You guys were drinking tea?
- Yeah. It's cold out.

40:39.688 --> 40:45.118
Terry, a man that looks like this shows up
on your doorstep, and you offer him tea.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.163
You would have plied
him full of alcohol.

40:48.822 --> 40:52.701
- Yes. I would have.
- Would you have taken advantage of me?

40:53.627 --> 40:58.640
Where's your glass?
In every way possible.

40:59.616 --> 41:01.093
Cheers.

41:01.669 --> 41:04.613
Married women so quickly
forget what a sex drive is.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.615
- Meg.
- Honey, I'm just kidding.

41:06.715 --> 41:09.285
But I do think sex is
like going to the gym.

41:09.385 --> 41:13.005
You should do it every day and never use
the same equipment two days in a row.

41:15.090 --> 41:17.134
I guess you're not the
settling-down type.

41:17.726 --> 41:20.829
The term "settling down,"
it just seems redundant to me.

41:20.929 --> 41:22.030
And marriage?

41:23.524 --> 41:26.594
It's not really a goal for me
like it is for most women.

41:26.694 --> 41:30.306
If I found the right guy,
but that's a big if.

41:30.406 --> 41:34.018
The right guy has to make me
laugh and be smarter than me.

41:34.118 --> 41:36.862
Do you think love
follows all those rules?

41:37.246 --> 41:39.189
I mean, you could get
swept off your feet, right?

41:39.289 --> 41:41.250
Absolutely.

41:41.351 --> 41:44.194
By an incredibly smart
and really funny guy.

41:46.413 --> 41:48.390
How did you two meet?

41:49.091 --> 41:51.919
- Where do we start?
- College BFFs.

41:52.019 --> 41:54.997
Yeah, we've known each other
and we go so far back.

41:55.097 --> 41:57.190
And don't let this one fool you.

41:57.891 --> 42:00.585
I wasn't always the
wild one of the pair.

42:09.711 --> 42:11.788
It's true. It's shocking, right?

42:13.407 --> 42:16.460
This one, the wild one.
It's surprising, right?

42:17.286 --> 42:20.005
No, not really.

42:25.591 --> 42:28.530
When... When Meg...

42:28.630 --> 42:30.866
When I told her I was
moving back to Georgia,

42:30.966 --> 42:33.494
she insisted on being
our real estate agent.

42:33.594 --> 42:36.330
And just happened to own a
house down the street from me.

42:36.430 --> 42:38.023
Which Jeffrey loved.

42:41.935 --> 42:45.020
Yeah, I was talking to
Colin about where he lived,

42:45.120 --> 42:49.093
- but he wouldn't tell me where he lived.
- Yeah, well, I don't blame him.

42:49.293 --> 42:52.254
Colin just broke up with his fiancée.

42:52.988 --> 42:54.790
It's been really tough for him.

42:56.492 --> 42:59.286
Did you two know each
other before tonight?

42:59.386 --> 43:00.412
- No.
- Yes.

43:00.512 --> 43:02.531
- No.
- No.

43:09.963 --> 43:11.682
Drink some more wine.

43:13.217 --> 43:15.143
Oh, God.

43:16.220 --> 43:19.164
A mother's work is never done.
You two behave yourselves.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.942
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

43:29.692 --> 43:33.453
- Are you going to behave yourself?
- I don't know, Colin.

43:34.071 --> 43:36.081
Behave yourself.

43:37.591 --> 43:39.468
I will.

43:49.812 --> 43:53.849
Where can I smoke without getting wet?

43:56.944 --> 44:01.440
The garage should be good. It's just...
It's the door at the end of the hall.

44:42.564 --> 44:46.068
Hey. Can I get one of those?

44:48.312 --> 44:52.049
Sure, there you go.
You can have that one.

44:52.149 --> 44:53.742
Thank you.

45:06.413 --> 45:08.456
So, what's the deal?

45:09.074 --> 45:10.217
What do you mean?

45:11.627 --> 45:13.862
She's happily married.

45:13.962 --> 45:16.657
Well, I guess, that depends
on how you define happily.

45:18.225 --> 45:20.077
What does that mean?

45:20.177 --> 45:22.871
It means you just never know what's
going on behind closed doors.

45:22.971 --> 45:25.023
Is there something going
on between you two?

45:29.177 --> 45:30.696
Is there?

45:33.982 --> 45:35.809
Are you serious?

45:38.228 --> 45:40.088
You two are having an affair?

45:47.154 --> 45:51.483
- I can't believe she didn't tell me.
- You know, sometimes you like someone...

45:51.583 --> 45:53.427
I don't... What?

45:54.169 --> 45:55.846
You feel close to them.

45:56.547 --> 46:00.475
But they don't feel the same
way about you. You know?

46:03.846 --> 46:09.159
She hasn't told me because she doesn't
think we're very close anymore?

46:11.345 --> 46:13.084
What are you saying?

46:15.082 --> 46:16.825
You talked about this?

46:21.021 --> 46:24.666
When I got here, I didn't
even know you were coming.

46:25.351 --> 46:29.880
She didn't want you to find out.
Not this way.

46:30.372 --> 46:34.801
I wrecked my car and the
first place I came was here.

46:34.918 --> 46:36.995
Because I knew Jeffrey
wasn't going to be here.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.108
Hey, Colin.

46:54.037 --> 46:55.597
You're so full of shit.

46:57.900 --> 47:00.952
- What?
- I said, "You're so full of shit."

47:01.528 --> 47:03.639
Terry is my best friend.

47:03.739 --> 47:08.502
I know everything about her,
and she knows everything about me.

47:08.602 --> 47:12.981
So, there's no way she would ever
have an affair and not tell me.

47:13.582 --> 47:17.046
It doesn't add up.
And, you know what else doesn't add up?

47:17.146 --> 47:22.265
You don't add up. And I'm going to
find out exactly what's going on.

47:22.524 --> 47:25.769
- Hey, Terry! Terry!
- Hey!

47:55.516 --> 47:58.944
- Where's Meg?
- She changed her mind.

47:59.044 --> 48:00.229
About?

48:01.213 --> 48:03.032
Staying.

48:03.132 --> 48:05.600
- She left?
- Yeah.

48:05.884 --> 48:08.145
Well, was she upset?

48:08.303 --> 48:11.882
No. But I don't know her.

48:13.275 --> 48:14.884
I'm going to call her.

48:19.389 --> 48:21.250
So, you lied?

48:22.151 --> 48:23.886
Excuse me?

48:23.986 --> 48:27.080
About your husband. You lied.

48:29.116 --> 48:31.193
So, where is he?

48:33.954 --> 48:36.548
He went on a golf trip with his father.

48:36.874 --> 48:39.468
- A golf trip?
- Yeah.

48:40.494 --> 48:42.265
I'm going to get some water.
Are you thirsty?

48:42.365 --> 48:44.389
- Do you want anything?
- No.

48:45.174 --> 48:49.695
Yeah, I'm going to call Meg and the
tow truck, see if they're coming.

48:59.480 --> 49:02.507
Are you sure she wasn't
upset when she left?

49:02.607 --> 49:03.743
Yeah.

49:04.777 --> 49:08.205
But like I said, I don't know her.

49:33.138 --> 49:34.815
Colin?

49:45.767 --> 49:47.411
Colin?

50:03.961 --> 50:06.805
Up again? Here we go.

50:08.173 --> 50:10.242
- Here we go.
- Put her down!

50:10.342 --> 50:12.851
- Hey, Mom.
- Do it again.

50:12.951 --> 50:17.733
Again? All right. Let's do it. Let's go.
And up! Touch the sky!

50:18.976 --> 50:24.531
No, Ryan. Ryan, baby,
you have to go to bed, okay? Please.

50:24.690 --> 50:27.426
Ryan and I are just having some fun,
that's all. Aren't we, Ryan?

50:27.526 --> 50:30.554
No. Ryan, come on, bugaboo.

50:30.654 --> 50:34.791
It's past your bedtime, sweetie. Okay?

50:35.242 --> 50:36.602
Please.

50:36.702 --> 50:40.255
Terry, is there something wrong?
Did I do something wrong?

50:41.373 --> 50:44.485
Go to bed, sweetheart, okay?

50:44.585 --> 50:48.364
What is this? Who gave you this?
No. Give it to me.

50:48.464 --> 50:51.325
Ryan and I are friends. I wanted her to
have something real special, that's all.

50:51.425 --> 50:52.809
Keep it.

50:53.727 --> 50:57.623
Baby, go to sleep, okay?

50:57.723 --> 51:01.127
Mommy and her friend will be downstairs.

51:01.227 --> 51:04.488
All right, sweetheart?
Okay, bugaboo.

51:05.022 --> 51:06.365
Bye, Ryan.

51:09.176 --> 51:11.119
I'll see you later, okay?

51:15.407 --> 51:16.875
Kids.

51:17.951 --> 51:19.645
They know, you know?

51:19.745 --> 51:24.257
They have a real sense
of who's good, who's bad.

51:24.875 --> 51:26.594
And your daughter, she has...

51:39.256 --> 51:40.299
Okay.

51:42.768 --> 51:45.153
Come on. Come on, get up.

51:48.524 --> 51:50.492
Put the baby back down.

51:54.438 --> 51:56.732
- Please.
- Put the baby back.

51:59.159 --> 52:04.006
It's okay, baby. Just go back to sleep.
Everything's going to be okay, okay?

52:24.059 --> 52:27.421
Don't you do anything stupid like
that again. Do you understand me?

52:27.521 --> 52:29.823
- Yes.
- You do?

52:33.460 --> 52:35.620
Come on. In the bathroom.

52:37.948 --> 52:40.751
Let's go. Come on!

52:44.288 --> 52:45.839
Go on.

52:47.499 --> 52:49.500
In the bathroom.

52:56.091 --> 52:57.159
- Get in.
- What?

52:57.259 --> 52:59.061
Get in.

53:00.512 --> 53:02.138
Get in.

53:03.090 --> 53:04.816
Stay right there.

54:05.135 --> 54:07.796
Come on. Get out.

54:22.586 --> 54:24.004
Turn the lights on.

54:28.434 --> 54:30.377
- Are these your clothes?
- Yes.

54:30.477 --> 54:33.513
- Right here?
- Yeah.

54:38.861 --> 54:41.496
- Put those on.
- I'm fine.

54:43.323 --> 54:45.083
Hey. Hey.

54:45.617 --> 54:50.597
Put those clothes on.
I'm not going to tell you again.

54:52.041 --> 54:54.009
Go on.

55:12.953 --> 55:14.196
Turn around.

55:16.106 --> 55:18.075
Stand up straight.

55:33.207 --> 55:36.510
Please. Please.

55:37.169 --> 55:38.679
Please, what?

55:40.547 --> 55:43.433
You don't have to do this.

56:04.938 --> 56:06.581
Don't flatter yourself.

56:09.668 --> 56:11.128
Put your clothes on.

56:14.456 --> 56:16.901
- Fuck you.
- What did you say?

56:17.001 --> 56:20.738
- I said, "Fuck you."
- I would be real careful if I were you.

56:20.838 --> 56:22.514
You're not going to kill me.

56:22.715 --> 56:25.600
If you were going to kill me,
you would have done that already.

56:25.884 --> 56:29.521
Maybe, this is some sick fantasy

56:29.763 --> 56:32.461
you're playing out against
your ex-girlfriend.

56:32.561 --> 56:36.587
What was it, your fiancée?
Or your sick mother.

56:36.687 --> 56:40.123
I don't know. I don't care.

56:40.524 --> 56:41.926
Can we just move it along?

56:42.026 --> 56:46.013
Because I'm really getting sick and
tired of your sadistic bullshit.

56:46.113 --> 56:50.225
Terry, I would have thought with
all those brains you've got, DA,

56:50.325 --> 56:53.062
you would have figured out
the game we're playing by now.

56:53.162 --> 56:56.148
- This is a game?
- It's all a game.

56:56.448 --> 56:59.777
- Yeah, well, I don't play, asshole.
- Well, we're just getting to the fun part.

56:59.877 --> 57:02.888
Yeah, well, I'm sure
the fun is long over.

57:20.264 --> 57:22.324
Answer the phone.

57:25.319 --> 57:29.303
Hello. Yes, there's an intruder in my house.
There's a crazy man in my house.

57:29.403 --> 57:32.626
He's trying to kill me.
17 Creston Lane. Please hurry!

57:32.993 --> 57:35.504
- Put that down!
- Okay. Okay.

57:43.896 --> 57:45.080
Hey!

57:48.550 --> 57:51.745
- Hey! Hey, stop!
- Please, Colin.

57:51.845 --> 57:53.897
- I will shoot you!
- Okay.

57:54.014 --> 57:55.958
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Okay.

57:56.058 --> 58:00.004
- I will shoot you!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

58:00.104 --> 58:04.550
I called 911. The police are on their way.
It's over, Colin. Okay?

58:04.650 --> 58:07.469
So, just leave, okay?
All you have to do is just leave.

58:07.569 --> 58:12.558
Look. If you leave now, you haven't
hurt me, you haven't hurt my family.

58:12.658 --> 58:16.261
I don't have a reason to carry this on,
Colin, but you've got to go. Just go!

58:16.361 --> 58:17.930
- Go get the kids.
- What do you mean?

58:18.030 --> 58:21.642
- You're absolutely right. We've got to go.
- No. I will call the operator right now.

58:21.742 --> 58:24.820
- Go get the kids.
- No, please. Please let...

58:24.920 --> 58:28.466
- I'll go get them!
- No, I'll go! I'll get them. I'll get them.

58:32.094 --> 58:35.564
It's okay, baby. I know.

58:39.251 --> 58:41.195
Go that way.

58:54.174 --> 58:56.301
Don't stop. Keep moving.

58:56.769 --> 58:58.420
Keep moving.

58:59.788 --> 59:01.173
Come on, let's go.

59:03.609 --> 59:05.152
Keep moving.

59:05.252 --> 59:07.429
- Mommy.
- Get up!

59:08.580 --> 59:13.168
Come on, get in the car. Let's go.

59:31.320 --> 59:34.206
- Are you going to tell me where we're going?
- Just keep straight.

59:40.904 --> 59:42.130
You don't look so good.

59:45.501 --> 59:48.720
You lost a lot of blood.
You need to get to a hospital.

59:52.591 --> 59:56.103
I need you to shut up.
Just keep driving straight.

01:00:01.733 --> 01:00:03.318
Just keep driving.

01:00:05.729 --> 01:00:08.156
Don't even think about it.

01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:31.346
You know, when the cops get to my
house and see signs of struggle,

01:00:31.505 --> 01:00:34.366
your blood all over my kitchen,

01:00:34.466 --> 01:00:38.987
and an empty house, they'll run my tags.

01:00:41.824 --> 01:00:44.994
It's not too late. If not a hospital,

01:00:45.094 --> 01:00:48.335
I can take you somewhere, anywhere,
but you can't stay in this car because

01:00:48.435 --> 01:00:50.841
they'll eventually spot
my tags and pull me over.

01:00:50.941 --> 01:00:55.203
I'm not going to warn you again.
I need you to shut the hell up.

01:01:29.021 --> 01:01:30.322
Shit.

01:01:41.658 --> 01:01:45.087
Shit. God damn it.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.091
- What do you want me to do?
- Pull over.

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:51.593
Stay calm.

01:01:58.525 --> 01:02:00.119
- What are you doing?
- Get off me.

01:02:00.219 --> 01:02:03.480
- No, no. Please. No.
- Come on.

01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:04.748
No.

01:02:04.848 --> 01:02:06.959
It's just a little motivation
to keep your mouth shut.

01:02:07.059 --> 01:02:08.369
I won't do anything, I promise.

01:02:08.469 --> 01:02:10.354
- Please put my baby back.
- Just shut up!

01:02:11.855 --> 01:02:14.500
I hope my APB hasn't
crossed state lines.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.701
Your what?

01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:24.544
Just keep your mouth shut.
I ain't got nothing to lose.

01:02:24.644 --> 01:02:26.979
- You stand to lose it all.
- I won't do anything, I promise.

01:02:27.079 --> 01:02:28.697
- Please put him down.
- Just be smart.

01:02:32.618 --> 01:02:34.653
License and registration, please.

01:02:34.753 --> 01:02:36.680
- Mommy?
- Okay.

01:02:38.465 --> 01:02:41.935
- Mommy.
- Everything's okay, baby.

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:44.747
Your baby needs to be in a car seat.

01:02:44.847 --> 01:02:49.335
He was, he was, but we took
him out just as we stopped.

01:02:49.435 --> 01:02:51.928
He was crying. He's gone to sleep now.

01:02:52.813 --> 01:02:54.489
Mommy.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.426
- What happened to your head?
- What now?

01:02:57.526 --> 01:02:59.345
Your head. What happened to it?

01:02:59.445 --> 01:03:03.557
I was fixing the windows in
the storm, but it fought back.

01:03:03.657 --> 01:03:05.334
Mommy.

01:03:05.659 --> 01:03:07.210
Right back.

01:03:08.328 --> 01:03:12.090
- Is everything all right, Officer?
- Mommy, where is Daddy?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.093
I want to go home.

01:03:20.215 --> 01:03:22.225
Ma'am, could you step
out of the car, please?

01:03:47.993 --> 01:03:51.713
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

01:03:51.914 --> 01:03:55.250
Were you trying to signal me
with your headlights back there?

01:03:55.959 --> 01:03:58.470
You flashed your brights
at me back there.

01:03:59.846 --> 01:04:00.847
Ma'am.

01:04:03.092 --> 01:04:05.251
No, I...

01:04:06.887 --> 01:04:08.706
I was reaching for the radio

01:04:08.806 --> 01:04:12.859
and my hand must have
slipped and hit the brights.

01:04:14.395 --> 01:04:18.198
Honestly, it wouldn't be the first time.
I'm really sorry.

01:04:20.626 --> 01:04:22.494
Who's the man in the car with you?

01:04:25.739 --> 01:04:27.582
The man in the car?

01:04:28.826 --> 01:04:30.686
Who is he?

01:04:30.786 --> 01:04:34.172
Well, Officer,

01:04:36.208 --> 01:04:37.968
it's kind of embarrassing.

01:04:39.712 --> 01:04:41.680
My husband,

01:04:43.974 --> 01:04:46.685
he's out of town.

01:04:47.803 --> 01:04:52.082
And you must think I'm awful.

01:04:52.182 --> 01:04:54.251
Look, lady, it's none of my business.

01:04:54.351 --> 01:04:58.088
But you might do whatever you're
doing without the kids around.

01:04:58.188 --> 01:05:01.408
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- Yes, Officer. I'm really sorry.

01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:05.137
Are you sure everything's all right?
You keep looking back at the car.

01:05:05.237 --> 01:05:07.205
Is there something you need to tell me?

01:05:12.578 --> 01:05:15.756
I can't say anything right now.

01:05:19.209 --> 01:05:22.763
All right, ma'am.
Have a nice night. Don't move.

01:05:24.548 --> 01:05:26.308
Stay right there!

01:05:29.011 --> 01:05:31.855
Get over here! Right here.

01:05:35.851 --> 01:05:38.921
He could have been alive
if it wasn't for you.

01:05:49.531 --> 01:05:53.018
It's your fault! I tell you to do something,
you do it. Do you understand me?

01:05:53.118 --> 01:05:55.229
- I will kill you. Do you understand me?
- Yes.

01:05:55.329 --> 01:05:56.963
- Do you understand me?
- Yes!

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.400
Go on and get in the car.
Get around there. You're at my mercy.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.055
Do you understand me? You are
going to do exactly as you're told.

01:06:05.956 --> 01:06:08.183
Get in the car. Let's go.

01:06:33.992 --> 01:06:35.961
Why are you doing this?

01:06:38.288 --> 01:06:39.881
You'll see.

01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:46.322
Pull in here.

01:06:47.965 --> 01:06:50.642
This house right here. Pull in.

01:06:51.385 --> 01:06:53.270
There you go.

01:06:53.846 --> 01:06:58.308
Pull straight in. And I want you
to back up on the side right here.

01:07:00.144 --> 01:07:02.103
Back it up a little bit.

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:04.929
That's right.

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:07.292
Keep going.

01:07:09.403 --> 01:07:11.246
That's good.

01:07:13.023 --> 01:07:15.083
Grab the kids, let's go.

01:07:21.957 --> 01:07:24.993
Go on. Put the kids in here.

01:07:34.345 --> 01:07:38.240
We're just going to have a
little sleepover, okay, baby?

01:07:40.476 --> 01:07:42.778
- Listen.
- Come on.

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:48.116
I love you.

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:54.481
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up. Go on.

01:07:55.657 --> 01:07:58.460
Through the door right there. Come on.

01:08:01.038 --> 01:08:06.134
I want you to go in that bathroom
over there. Find a first aid kit.

01:08:06.752 --> 01:08:09.972
Patch me up. Come on.

01:08:13.809 --> 01:08:15.737
I don't know where a first aid kit is.

01:08:15.837 --> 01:08:19.363
Just keep looking.
There's something in there.

01:08:30.067 --> 01:08:32.478
Terry, meet Alexis.

01:08:32.778 --> 01:08:35.305
Alexis, Terry.

01:08:37.448 --> 01:08:40.502
You should have seen
the look on her face.

01:08:43.413 --> 01:08:45.340
Life draining from her eyes.

01:08:48.085 --> 01:08:50.761
And after all I did for her.

01:08:54.049 --> 01:08:55.934
Come on, what have you got?

01:09:00.122 --> 01:09:01.749
Give me the key.

01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:03.291
- Give me the key. Come on!
- Okay.

01:09:10.157 --> 01:09:11.341
Shit!

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:13.741
Come here.

01:09:15.237 --> 01:09:17.264
- Come here. Get on your knees.
- Why?

01:09:17.363 --> 01:09:19.633
On your knees. Take your coat off.
Take your coat off.

01:09:19.742 --> 01:09:24.071
There you go. Put your hands behind
your back. Now. There you go.

01:09:25.205 --> 01:09:26.548
You stay right here.

01:09:27.582 --> 01:09:31.636
I don't want you running around.
Right here. Stay right there. Legs out.

01:09:33.296 --> 01:09:37.309
- Please don't.
- Shut up. Just shut up.

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:39.096
- Hello? Hello?
<i>- Finally, babe.</i>

01:10:39.196 --> 01:10:40.931
<i>I'm at the hotel.
I've been here all night.</i>

01:10:41.031 --> 01:10:43.083
<i>I left you, like, five messages.
Where are you?</i>

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.837
- Jeffrey?
<i>- Alexis.</i>

01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:49.881
<i>Alexis?</i>

01:10:52.584 --> 01:10:54.386
<i>Alexis?</i>

01:10:58.132 --> 01:11:01.768
<i>"Didn't want to wake you,
'cause you looked so beautiful sleeping."</i>

01:11:01.885 --> 01:11:03.662
<i>- 17...
- 17 Creston Lane.</i>

01:11:03.862 --> 01:11:06.148
<i>- ...Creston. Lane.
- Lane. </i>

01:11:06.473 --> 01:11:08.358
Oh, my God.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:15.490
<i>- Alexis? I'm at the hotel.</i>
- She's dead, Jeffrey.

01:11:16.066 --> 01:11:19.053
- Your goddamn girlfriend is dead.
<i>- Terry.</i>

01:11:19.153 --> 01:11:21.037
- Call the police.
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

01:11:21.155 --> 01:11:24.374
Jeffrey, call the goddamn police.

01:11:29.997 --> 01:11:32.483
<i>You've reached 911 emergency response.</i>

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:36.219
<i>We are receiving a high
volume of calls in this area.</i>

01:11:40.057 --> 01:11:42.292
Ryan, baby. Come on.

01:12:07.175 --> 01:12:08.401
Come on.

01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:15.884
Shit!

01:13:02.673 --> 01:13:05.467
Okay, Ryan. I need you
to stay right here, okay?

01:13:05.567 --> 01:13:07.561
Be very quiet and wait for
Mommy to come back, okay?

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.381
- You bitch!
- Jeffrey called!

01:16:06.067 --> 01:16:07.854
- What?
- Jeffrey called. He's on his way.

01:16:08.254 --> 01:16:11.512
I know why you killed her.
The affair she was having with my husband.

01:16:11.612 --> 01:16:13.655
- Where is he?
- This is about getting revenge with Jeffrey.

01:16:13.755 --> 01:16:15.374
- Where is he?
- Mommy.

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:18.960
Run, Ryan, run!

01:16:23.999 --> 01:16:26.134
- Where are you going? Come here.
- Get off of me.

01:18:15.886 --> 01:18:17.880
Excuse me. What's your business?

01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:20.791
- I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in there.
- That's my... Terry! Terry!

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.487
Terry. Terry.

01:18:35.714 --> 01:18:39.309
Baby... I'm sorry.

01:18:41.804 --> 01:18:43.480
Listen to me.

01:18:44.556 --> 01:18:46.900
It's not what you think.

01:18:47.643 --> 01:18:49.578
It didn't mean anything to me.

01:18:50.771 --> 01:18:52.155
Baby.

01:18:53.107 --> 01:18:54.449
Terry, it didn't mean...

01:19:43.449 --> 01:19:46.501
Great. That goes on
the first level. Thanks.

01:19:48.662 --> 01:19:50.773
So, it looks like you'll
be right at home in there.

01:19:50.873 --> 01:19:52.107
It's perfect.

01:19:52.207 --> 01:19:54.151
If you have any questions,
you know how to reach me.

01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:58.055
Everything is going to be great.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:20:09.516 --> 01:20:11.526
Come on, Ryan.

01:20:12.686 --> 01:20:14.505
- Are you taking them to the park?
- Yeah.

01:20:14.605 --> 01:20:17.800
Great. I'll walk over on
my way to the court house.

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.735
Come on, baby. How do you
like the house, bugaboo?

01:20:20.736 --> 01:20:21.771
- Yes.
- Yay.
