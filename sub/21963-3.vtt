WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.088
So I got some great news
from LaFrey this morning.

00:20.121 --> 00:23.057
Any guesses?

00:23.091 --> 00:24.758
I'll give you a hint.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.360
Take my wife, please.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.262
-What are you doing?
-Be... What?

00:28.296 --> 00:30.331
This is why you're not allowed
to take weapons in the field.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.033
Anyway, I'm gonna get to see
my wife soon.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.836
She's being transferred
to a nearby mental facility.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.871
-How do you think that's
gonna go? -What do you mean?

00:37.905 --> 00:39.907
Great. It's gonna be...

00:39.940 --> 00:43.111
intense, but it-it'll be,
it'll be...

00:43.144 --> 00:44.912
it'll be great. What about you,
though? I just realized,

00:44.945 --> 00:47.248
you know, I'm always talking
about my love life,

00:47.281 --> 00:50.251
but I've never once had the
chance to ask you about yours.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.687
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.323
Have you ever been married?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.859
Have you ever been in love?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.762
Just so you know, this isn't
gonna stop, Leroy.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.033
My last girlfriend, Tanya,
and I were together for a while.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.069
We broke up a few years ago and
I haven't dated much since.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.404
Have you tried getting
back together?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.440
What? No.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.408
Anyways, all she ever wanted
to do was karaoke.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.144
Like, every weekend.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.079
And she always sang the same
song, "Walking in Memphis."

01:21.014 --> 01:22.650
-This song?
-* Put on my

01:22.683 --> 01:23.951
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-* Blue suede shoes

01:23.984 --> 01:25.453
I-I totally remember this. Uh...

01:25.486 --> 01:27.455
* And I boarded the plane

01:27.488 --> 01:29.457
-You all right?
-* Touched down

01:29.490 --> 01:31.125
-Leroy? -* In the land
of the Delta Blues... *

01:31.159 --> 01:33.794
Hello?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.062
Leroy!

01:35.095 --> 01:36.664
Dude, what is wrong with you?

01:36.697 --> 01:37.898
What?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.833
Snap out of it, man.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.735
Turn that song off.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.138
-You're like in a trance or
something. -(machinery whirs)

01:44.172 --> 01:46.740
Anyway, she just got engaged;
it's on her Facebook.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.176
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.711
(scoffs) Dude,
I could care less.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.825
Oh, man.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.660
Gross. Beginner's luck.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.128
So sorry.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.632
*

02:13.334 --> 02:14.535
LaFREY: Listen up.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.504
A man's body was just found

02:16.537 --> 02:19.207
at a resort in Tampa
called Whispers.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.175
Ooh, Whispers. I wonder what
they're whispering about.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.110
I bet it's like,
"Want to see my butt?"

02:23.143 --> 02:24.845
-Deesh.
-LaFREY: His autopsy revealed

02:24.878 --> 02:26.480
something strange.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.817
His heart was missing,
but there was no incision.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.984
Do you have any suspects?

02:31.018 --> 02:32.820
Yes. Keith Jorgensen,

02:32.853 --> 02:34.955
the photographer
at the resort.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.290
Now, there was a similar murder

02:36.324 --> 02:38.192
six years ago
at a resort in Hawaii.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.394
Keith Jorgensen was also
living there at the time,

02:40.428 --> 02:42.230
but he was working as a surgeon.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.832
Who would leave Hawaii
to go to Florida?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.534
Florida's for people who
don't know about Hawaii.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.968
I don't know.
It sounds like a guy

02:48.001 --> 02:49.503
who wanted to follow
his passion.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.138
Someone who's sick and tired
of being told

02:51.171 --> 02:52.473
what he should do with his life.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.875
Somebody who stood up
and said...

02:54.908 --> 02:56.977
"I-I love me."

02:57.010 --> 02:59.813
-Or a skilled organ thief. -I'm
switching my guess to Leroy's.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.049
Well, hold on now.
Th-there was no incision.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.218
So I think we have to at least
be open to the possibility

03:04.252 --> 03:06.053
that this could be
something bigger.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.689
Which is exactly why
it's your job to figure it out.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.990
Let's get to work.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.159
BARRY:
Oh, Trip Advisor says that

03:12.192 --> 03:14.928
the guacamole making class at
Whispers is a "must do."

03:14.962 --> 03:16.597
Leroy, write that down.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.832
No. We won't be doing that.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.734
*

03:26.039 --> 03:27.541
Hey, Leroy, it's me.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.176
Just kidding, man, it's me.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.178
-What's that?
-Uh, this?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.913
It's just an old bachelor party
tradition.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.848
-Bachelor party?
-That's right.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.084
Listen. Our cover story

03:37.117 --> 03:39.787
is my bachelor party.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.423
You know bachelor parties
are usually, like, 12 dudes.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.425
Not true. See, my actual
bachelor party

03:44.458 --> 03:45.959
was just me and my friend Rory.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.695
I mean, he did end up

03:47.728 --> 03:49.397
having to cancel
at the last minute,

03:49.430 --> 03:50.931
and I went by myself,
but it's nothing.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.199
You had a solo bachelor party?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.768
Hey, Leroy. You know what?

03:54.802 --> 03:58.372
Since my lady is coming back,
we should find someone for you.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.674
-No, I'm good.
-I'm serious, man. Come on.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.811
Hey, what about her?

04:03.844 --> 04:06.414
The lady with her husband
and toddler?

04:06.447 --> 04:07.548
Yeah.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.116
No.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.652
All right. Just getting used
to your taste here.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.421
Hey. Look at her.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.988
She's a cop.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.291
She's probably here
on the same case.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.493
She like, "Hey, I like
to solve crimes."

04:19.527 --> 04:21.462
And you can be like, "Yeah.
I like to solve crimes, too."

04:21.495 --> 04:23.263
And then you, like,
lick each other's faces.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.232
I'd rather just focus
on the case.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.301
Welcome to Whispers.
Checking in?

04:27.335 --> 04:29.236
Yes. Uh, reservation under
"Bachelor."

04:29.269 --> 04:31.171
We're the bachelor party.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.574
That's not only my name,
Mitch Bachelor,

04:33.607 --> 04:36.276
but we're also here
for my bachelor party.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.846
-Sounds fun.
-LEROY: No, it doesn't.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.515
Oh. Also, we, uh, booked a photo
session. I think with Keith?

04:41.549 --> 04:45.152
And, uh, how many guys should
I say are coming? 12? 14?

04:45.185 --> 04:46.286
No, just us.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.592
-Is there a problem?
-No.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.261
I've been using this new, uh,
coconut oil,

04:54.294 --> 04:57.331
and my hands feel like
an ancient river pebble.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.600
-Here, have a touch.
-Ew. No.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.802
It hasn't even absorbed yet.
You're dripping.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.170
LaFREY: I have an assignment
for you two.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.706
I need surveillance

05:05.739 --> 05:07.875
on a very important target, and
I need it to be kept discreet.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.276
ANNIE:
Isn't this your daughter?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.679
Shannon turned 13
and suddenly thinks

05:11.712 --> 05:13.447
that she can outsmart
her mother.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.116
Well, I am going to show her
that she is sorely mistaken.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.518
Yeah, because you can't
outsmart mothers.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.786
Mothers are the smartest.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.153
Last night,

05:20.187 --> 05:21.522
without warning, I was blocked

05:21.555 --> 05:23.524
from all social media.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.326
Her last post was
"#DougO'Clock."

05:26.360 --> 05:27.995
I need to know what that means.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.229
Who is Doug?

05:29.262 --> 05:30.831
What the hell is Doug O'Clock?

05:30.864 --> 05:32.500
And what exactly happens
at that time?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.167
Good luck.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.671
(sighs)

05:37.705 --> 05:39.673
Can't believe you bought me
a linen outfit.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.375
I don't like
when my clothes billow.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.076
Yeah, but it looks great.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.513
-I might as well be wearing
the wind. -MAN: Hey, guys.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.482
I'm Keith. And you are the
Bachelor bachelor party?

05:48.516 --> 05:52.820
That's right.
I'm Mitch Bachelor and this...

05:52.853 --> 05:55.155
is Tito.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.991
Hey. I'm Tito.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.226
So I don't know
if they told you,

05:59.259 --> 06:00.728
but I shoot everything on film.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.095
I'm a bit of a formalist,

06:02.129 --> 06:03.764
so none of this digital crap.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.332
So what are we thinking here?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.367
Oh, uh, I don't know.
I guess I was just thinking

06:07.401 --> 06:09.570
some regular old
friends hanging out

06:09.603 --> 06:11.572
-at bachelor party poses.
-Right.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.241
Right. And is the rest of
the group coming, or...

06:14.274 --> 06:16.276
No. No, it's just us.
Me and Teets.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.946
Huh. Well, this is
gonna be gorgeous.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.714
Let's, uh, let's get into it.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.917
-Yeah, let's get loose.
-Loosey-goosey.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.553
Holding a cold one. Yeah. Oh,
yeah, yeah. There we go.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.421
-Hold a cold one. Yeah.
-(mimics can opening)

06:27.455 --> 06:28.889
How about some surfing? Ooh, I
got a couple of goofballs

06:28.922 --> 06:31.124
-on my hands. -LEROY: Max,
I'm gonna kill you.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.926
-No, there goes a shark.
-KEITH: Uh-oh. -Oh!

06:32.960 --> 06:35.596
-Careful. We're gonna need
a bigger surfboard. -Oh, no.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.364
Oh, are you guys feeling
like rock and rollers?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.901
-Yeah. Coldplay in the house.
(laughs) -Yeah.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.437
Hey, Keith. Uh, you always
been a photographer, or...

06:43.471 --> 06:45.473
Uh, no. Actually, you know,
I used to do something else.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.374
Back in Hawaii
I was just a surgeon.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.976
Wonder who would give up
being a doctor

06:49.009 --> 06:51.411
to be a resort photographer?
Just curious.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.981
Well, I would, when I realized
that photography was my passion.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.816
Now, uh... Ooh, that's great.
How about this?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.417
Jump up in the air
and high-five each other.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.120
There we go. Uh-oh.
(laughs)

07:00.153 --> 07:02.122
-So Tampa's a big change
from Hawaii. -Yeah.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.724
You running from somebody?

07:03.757 --> 07:06.126
Uh...

07:07.595 --> 07:09.963
Think I got everything I need.
Thanks, guys.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.432
Hey, Keith. Where were you
last Wednesday night?

07:12.466 --> 07:14.101
I was in a session.
You can pick up

07:14.134 --> 07:15.669
your photos tomorrow
at the concierge.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.771
Hey, wait a sec.

07:17.805 --> 07:21.441
Whoa. I had a bunch more poses
I wanted to try, too.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.450
WOMAN:
Once your avocado

07:30.484 --> 07:33.521
is nice and smooth,
it's time to season the guac,

07:33.554 --> 07:37.457
and this is where you can have
a little fun personalizing it.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.027
I checked the surveillance tape.
Keith lied to us.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.529
There was
no photo shoot on Wednesday.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.996
Okay, just keep your voice down.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.365
-We can't talk about that here.
-I agree,

07:45.398 --> 07:47.768
but since you made us come here,
I'm gonna talk about it.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.136
I didn't make us.
I mean, we had to.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.771
It's part of the package.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.439
Believe me, I didn't want
to be here, either.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.876
-You going hot-medium
or medium-mild? -Like, normal.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.045
'Cause I was thinking
about going hot-medium,

07:58.078 --> 08:00.447
but if that's out of your range,
I am happy to go medium-mild.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.450
Just do me a favor and
don't go hot-hot, 'cause then,

08:03.483 --> 08:05.986
-I can't even try it.
-(siren blares, horn honks)

08:07.688 --> 08:10.457
What is that?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.193
(police radio chatter)

08:13.226 --> 08:14.962
Don't disappear
in case we need you.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.398
-Whoa. It's a body.
-Hey.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.168
-There's your cop. Let's go talk
to her. -Wait. Max!

08:21.201 --> 08:22.970
-Hey, uh, so, what's the story
with the vic? -Back up. This is

08:23.003 --> 08:24.471
-an active crime scene. Behind
the yellow tape, please. -Oh.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.374
-Thanks. -It's actually okay.
My friend here's a cop.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.878
LAPD. And I'm a courtroom
sketch artist,

08:30.911 --> 08:34.414
so I know a lot about murders
and stuff, so it's no biggie.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.016
Well, I got to get back
to the crime scene,

08:36.049 --> 08:37.851
but if I, uh... if I need
a caricature of myself

08:37.885 --> 08:40.120
in a mermaid costume, I'll...
I'll come find you guys.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.791
Whatever.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.995
Oh, my God, Leroy, look.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.897
LEROY:
Damn, that's Keith.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.499
MAX:
How are we gonna get our photos?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.434
Okay, so, Keith wasn't our guy,

08:54.467 --> 08:56.369
but, obviously, he knows
something about the murders.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.738
Enough to get him killed.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.439
We need to find out
what he knew.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.908
Yeah, but first, uh,

09:00.941 --> 09:02.542
why don't we take
a chardonnay break?

09:02.576 --> 09:03.944
Huh? You deserve it.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.714
Uh, Officer?
Or Natalie, is it?

09:06.747 --> 09:10.117
Boy, crazy murder today, huh?

09:10.150 --> 09:11.919
I told you, I-I can't talk
about an investigation

09:11.952 --> 09:13.787
with a civilian.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.590
Okay, well, then, why don't the
three of us just grab a drink,

09:16.624 --> 09:19.860
and we'll talk about
your boyfriend, or-or husband?

09:19.893 --> 09:22.295
-Sorry. Which is it?
-Not super subtle, is he?

09:22.329 --> 09:24.297
Honestly,
I just met him at the airport,

09:24.331 --> 09:25.933
and now he follows me around.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.535
All right. One drink.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.604
Great! Yeah.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.205
We'd love to join you.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.641
Except for me.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.109
I'm very sick.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.879
-(laughs)
-Sorry about that.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.580
So do you always need

09:40.614 --> 09:42.282
someone else
to do the talking for you?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.484
(scoffs)
No, no. No, no, no, no.

09:44.517 --> 09:48.088
Believe me, I can be incredibly
charming if I so choose.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.657
You're lucky I let you sit down.

09:49.690 --> 09:53.861
No. Oh, I know.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.868
(clinking)

10:13.280 --> 10:16.149
Oh, these are nice.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.353
-(Natalie laughs) -MAX: I mean,
what is the purpose of this?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.355
Like, why would he want this?

10:22.389 --> 10:25.258
I don't know. It's kind of fun.
I'm with him.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.860
-What?
-Yeah. Why not?

10:26.894 --> 10:29.329
-Oh, you sellin' me out already?
-You should get one.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.131
-Ugh. I don't think so.
-(laughing)

10:34.067 --> 10:37.470
Uh, Bali.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.306
Hawaii.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.842
Tampa.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.752
(light buzzes)

10:53.186 --> 10:54.955
LEROY:
Hey,

10:54.988 --> 10:56.790
what happened out there
with that body anyway?

10:56.824 --> 10:58.859
I heard
they found a guy here last week

10:58.892 --> 11:00.660
-with his heart missing.
-Yeah. Ugh.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.296
Same thing.
Heart gone, no scar.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.665
It's the Sumerian symbol
for smoke.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.667
It is often used
in stories of a demon

11:07.701 --> 11:10.037
who takes different forms.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.471
Do you have a balcony
in your room?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.373
Maybe we just
have another drink?

11:13.406 --> 11:15.242
Stare out at the ocean?

11:15.275 --> 11:18.411
Personally,
I find the ocean disgusting.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.148
BARRY: She seduces men
by putting them in

11:21.181 --> 11:23.216
a hypnotic trance state,
and then

11:23.250 --> 11:25.018
absorbing their life force.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.254
Like stealing their hearts?

11:27.287 --> 11:30.390
No. Maybe.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.192
I will have another drink,
though.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.028
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.402
Leroy!

11:51.244 --> 11:53.046
My friend...
My... my friend that was there--

11:53.080 --> 11:54.347
do-do you know where he is is?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.083
Oh, he just left.
He was with a woman.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.184
Yeah. Where did they go?

11:57.217 --> 11:58.418
I don't know,

11:58.451 --> 11:59.719
but when they left,
they were tipsy.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.055
Do you still want
the waiters to sing

12:02.089 --> 12:04.091
"Happy Bachelor Party"
when they bring the churros out?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.559
That is so not important
right now!

12:09.129 --> 12:11.631
But, yes, we will be back
for the churros later,

12:11.664 --> 12:13.400
and we definitely want
that song, okay?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.068
-Yes.
-Thank you so much!

12:15.102 --> 12:16.469
I mean, we are some of
the most highly-trained agents

12:16.503 --> 12:18.205
at the Bureau, and we are

12:18.238 --> 12:20.607
-babysitting two teenagers
on a date. -Oh, come on.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.911
What's more important than
the mission of a mother's love?

12:23.944 --> 12:26.279
I know my four mothers would
have done anything for me.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.783
-You have four mothers?
-Yeah. Mom, Mum, Mommy and Lynn.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.552
It's a long story.
It involves a few remarriages

12:32.585 --> 12:34.454
and a whole bunch of lesbians.

12:34.487 --> 12:38.125
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's happening?

12:38.158 --> 12:42.095
Oh, uh, which one is Shannon?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.264
I don't know.
I didn't see them enter.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.566
-I was arguing with you!
-Well, what's happening?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.969
-Which one do I follow? Where
is she? -LaFREY: All right, what

12:49.002 --> 12:52.005
-is the latest? -Everything's
great. What's new with you?

12:52.039 --> 12:54.607
What's your weekend look like?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.509
Where is she?

12:57.710 --> 13:00.480
Where is she?

13:03.851 --> 13:06.786
(Natalie sighs)

13:06.820 --> 13:08.655
Uh...

13:08.688 --> 13:10.490
Hold up one second.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.826
(grunts softly)

13:12.860 --> 13:14.361
(Natalie sighs)

13:19.799 --> 13:23.036
Leroy? Leroy,
I need to talk to you!

13:23.070 --> 13:24.471
LEROY:
Sock on the door, Max.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.374
-Sock on the door!
-Come on!

13:27.407 --> 13:28.942
Uh, room service!

13:28.976 --> 13:31.044
We didn't order it.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.381
-Hi! -Hi, folks. I'm not crazy.
There's a succubus next door.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.783
Oh, and you really should try
the guacamole class.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.852
It's terrific.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.854
(Max grunting)

13:40.888 --> 13:43.156
Oh, my God! Leroy!

13:43.190 --> 13:44.791
-Leroy, listen to me.
-(Natalie gasps)

13:44.824 --> 13:46.726
-She is a succubus.
-(Natalie gasping)

13:46.759 --> 13:48.361
Okay? She's going
to draw you in,

13:48.395 --> 13:49.796
she's going to seduce you,

13:49.829 --> 13:51.064
and she's going
to take your heart

13:51.098 --> 13:52.832
out of your body.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.902
Max, what are you doing?
Didn't you see the sock?!

13:54.935 --> 13:57.504
No. Leroy, you need to listen
to me. She is going to kill you.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.873
Are you listening to yourself?
You sound ridiculous.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.976
All of the killers are the
same woman. She changes shape,

14:03.010 --> 14:04.912
but the tattoo stays the same.
Let me see your tattoos.

14:04.945 --> 14:08.081
-What? These?
-Yes. Those.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.649
-Ugh.
-Check these out. Leroy, look.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.051
-Max, would you get off of her.
-Where did you get these?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.020
-Get away from her!
-Where did you get these?

14:13.053 --> 14:16.689
I got them when I was
on spring break 15 years ago.

14:16.723 --> 14:19.059
-You're a liar. She is lying
right now. -I'm not.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.162
-Max, that's enough. -So many
girls had these tattoos.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.331
I saw them on
Blake Lively's blog.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.665
I think they're Chinese--

14:25.698 --> 14:27.834
I don't even know
what they mean.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.770
No, no, no. They're Sumerian
for "smoke." I saw it.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.772
Down in Keith's room,
he has a whole roomful

14:32.805 --> 14:34.041
of evidence.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.375
Keith Jorgensen

14:35.408 --> 14:37.444
was a recovering
drug addict.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.711
Why do you think

14:38.745 --> 14:40.713
he had to stop
being a surgeon?

14:40.747 --> 14:43.616
Because photography
was his passion?

14:43.650 --> 14:44.884
(sighs)

14:44.918 --> 14:46.586
Listen, I...
I think I should go.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.221
-This is... this is...
-No. No, no, no.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.889
You should stay.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.524
Max...

14:51.558 --> 14:53.860
-you were just leaving, right?
-Yeah.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.363
I'm sorry.
(laughs softly)

14:56.396 --> 14:58.031
I'm sorry, you guys.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.732
LEROY:
What is wrong with you?

15:02.102 --> 15:04.104
*

15:04.137 --> 15:06.573
Hold on. You know...

15:06.606 --> 15:08.475
it just occurred to me...

15:08.508 --> 15:12.445
Blake Lively's blog,
I mean, didn't start till 2014.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.447
LEROY:
Why would you know that?

15:14.481 --> 15:16.316
(whooshing)

15:16.349 --> 15:18.451
(deep, distorted):
You just couldn't leave.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.820
Leroy, look.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.289
Leroy, look! Look!

15:22.322 --> 15:23.623
Look! Leroy!

15:26.926 --> 15:28.828
Kill Max.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.930
Leroy? Leroy!

15:32.099 --> 15:33.933
Kill him now.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.604
(deep, distorted):
I should kill Max.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.671
Wait.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.806
What are you...

15:39.839 --> 15:41.041
what are you doing?

15:42.109 --> 15:43.410
Leroy, she...

15:43.443 --> 15:45.112
she's got you...

15:45.145 --> 15:47.080
under a spell.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.915
Leroy...

15:48.948 --> 15:51.018
Uh... Leroy...

15:51.051 --> 15:52.785
you have to wake up.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.454
(gasps)

15:56.656 --> 15:59.959
* Put on my blue suede shoes

15:59.993 --> 16:01.294
* And I

16:01.328 --> 16:03.263
* Boarded a plane

16:03.296 --> 16:04.998
* Touched down

16:05.032 --> 16:07.700
* In the land
of the Delta Blues *

16:07.734 --> 16:11.038
* In the middle
of the pouring rain... *

16:12.405 --> 16:15.108
(deep, distorted):
* W.C. Handy

16:15.142 --> 16:18.645
* Won't you look down
over me *

16:18.678 --> 16:20.647
-That's right.
-BOTH: * Yeah, I got

16:20.680 --> 16:22.215
-* a first class ticket
-Yeah, yeah.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.485
* But I'm as blue
as a boy can be *

16:25.518 --> 16:29.222
* Then I'm walking in Memphis

16:29.256 --> 16:33.560
* Walking with my feet
ten feet off of Beale *

16:33.593 --> 16:36.696
* Walking in Memphis

16:36.729 --> 16:38.498
* But do I really feel

16:38.531 --> 16:41.568
* The way I feel...

16:41.601 --> 16:42.969
Whoa!

16:43.002 --> 16:44.337
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:44.371 --> 16:46.939
Whoa!

16:50.343 --> 16:51.811
(grunting)

16:51.844 --> 16:52.912
(yells)

16:52.945 --> 16:54.647
(stabs)
Aah!

16:54.681 --> 16:56.816
(screaming)

16:56.849 --> 16:58.885
(gasping breaths)

16:58.918 --> 17:01.020
(deep, distorted grunts)

17:03.390 --> 17:05.358
(succubus screams)

17:05.392 --> 17:08.027
(wooden stick clatters
on street)

17:13.266 --> 17:15.202
LEROY:
Where the hell did she go?

17:19.639 --> 17:22.609
We are so, so sorry-- we did
not mean to lose your daughter.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.078
And it's so unlikely
she'd be dead by now.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.013
I don't want to hear it.
I just wa...

17:27.046 --> 17:28.881
Hello, Mother.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.383
Did you and your flunkies

17:30.417 --> 17:32.719
have a fun time
stalking me today?

17:32.752 --> 17:35.188
I had no idea what
we were dealing with.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.190
Do you really have
no respect for me?

17:37.224 --> 17:40.693
-Well...
-Listen, Shannon.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
When I was in the ninth grade,

17:42.762 --> 17:44.631
I ran away to Nicaragua
for five days,

17:44.664 --> 17:46.366
and my mom didn't even notice,

17:46.399 --> 17:47.767
'cause she was busy
throwing herself

17:47.800 --> 17:49.136
a week-long birthday party.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.238
She called it Bitsy's Bash.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.673
and the theme...
was cocaine.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.775
Look, I am sorry that

17:55.808 --> 17:58.044
we were spying on you today.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.580
But you need to realize
how lucky you are.

18:00.613 --> 18:04.117
Your mom only did this
because she loves you.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.954
I just wanted to know
who Doug O'Clock was.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.489
I mean, is that
your boyfriend, or...

18:09.522 --> 18:11.824
What? No.
We call him Doug O'Clock

18:11.858 --> 18:13.760
because he wears
an actual wristwatch

18:13.793 --> 18:15.328
like a throwback old person.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.598
Oh. Old people are so lame.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.569
Look, I...
I'm sorry, sweetie,

18:22.602 --> 18:25.272
I guess I'm just gonna have
to learn to trust you more.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.806
Please don't shut me out.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.342
Well, I guess I can
let you in on some stuff.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.644
-But just boys and school.
-Okay.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.413
Not horrible stuff
Dad says about you.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.081
Okay.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.617
*

18:37.650 --> 18:39.519
(mouths)

18:39.552 --> 18:41.354
You're welcome.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.490
LEROY:
I think you might have kicked

18:43.523 --> 18:45.325
the lady off the balcony.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.626
MAX:
It was a succubus,

18:46.659 --> 18:48.428
not a lady.
It wasn't a lady.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.096
(panting):
Um...

18:50.129 --> 18:52.098
just got a call
from St. Mary's.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.633
What's that?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.668
It's your wife.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.537
You can see her now.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.442
(sighs)

19:02.475 --> 19:05.545
Leroy, listen, I haven't
exactly been honest with you

19:05.578 --> 19:08.215
(whispers):
about, uh, my wife and stuff.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.318
Things weren't exactly...

19:11.351 --> 19:15.188
great between us
when she disappeared.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.956
So...

19:16.989 --> 19:19.359
I don't really know
what I'm walking into here.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.328
And then I just...

19:21.361 --> 19:23.696
I-I had to tell you that
for some reason.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.533
(sighs)

19:26.566 --> 19:28.034
Actually, I...

19:28.067 --> 19:30.203
wasn't completely honest
with you, either.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.805
-About Tanya.
-Huh?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.807
Truth is, I loved her.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.743
So I proposed.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.711
But she said no.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.680
Oh, dude.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.215
It gets worse.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.551
I did it at Dodger Stadium.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.520
On the jumbotron.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.323
Oh, wow.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.824
And the jumbotron guy...

19:51.858 --> 19:54.527
he wouldn't cut away,
he just...

19:54.561 --> 19:57.430
just hung there on me,
just... sobbing.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.366
Oh, geez.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.034
Ended up going viral,
they put techno music under it.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.436
(softly):
Of course they did.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.172
-I think I remember that one.
-Yeah.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.774
But I don't regret...

20:07.807 --> 20:09.542
being in love with her.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.711
I don't regret
asking her to marry me.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.214
I do regret hiding the ring
in the chili dog.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.916
Of course.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.118
Max Jennifer?

20:19.151 --> 20:20.753
She's ready.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.396
Hi, uh, Claire.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.032
Hi. Hey.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.735
Oh, my God.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.136
I feel like I've...

20:37.169 --> 20:38.971
-I have, uh, so much...
-Yeah.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.973
-Yeah. This is weird.
-I want to s... Yeah.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.142
It'd be nice...
if we had, like,

20:43.175 --> 20:45.144
(whispers):
some privacy, maybe.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.446
-Yeah.
-Do you think?

20:46.479 --> 20:47.914
Yeah, hey, uh...

20:47.947 --> 20:49.882
sorry, do you...
would you mind, uh,

20:49.916 --> 20:51.884
giving us a couple
of minutes?

20:51.918 --> 20:53.586
I'll be right outside.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.987
(door opens)

20:55.021 --> 20:56.989
Seems like a barrel of laughs.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.459
-(door closes)
-Yeah. He's the nicer one.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.760
(clears throat)

21:00.793 --> 21:02.662
Listen, I-I don't
want to rush you

21:02.695 --> 21:04.130
or anything, but...

21:04.163 --> 21:06.333
I have to know--
what happened that night?

21:06.366 --> 21:08.801
Because, for me, it was just,
like, this flash of light,

21:08.835 --> 21:12.138
and-and then I woke up
hours later.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.239
I have to know.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.207
Mm.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.645
Were you... abducted?

21:30.323 --> 21:33.493
Do not look for me.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.462
What?

21:37.029 --> 21:40.333
(intro to "Walking in Memphis"
playing)

21:43.035 --> 21:46.973
* Then I'm walking in Memphis

21:47.006 --> 21:50.543
* I was walking with my feet
ten feet off of Beale *

21:50.577 --> 21:53.480
* Walking in Memphis...

21:53.513 --> 21:55.515
* But do I really...
