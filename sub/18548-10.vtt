WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:07.980
It is here.
Exactly as you specified.

00:10.740 --> 00:14.740
My sources told me
you were an exceptional architect.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.500
I can see they are correct.

00:16.540 --> 00:17.780
You honour me.

00:20.180 --> 00:22.060
And what of the builders?

00:22.100 --> 00:24.100
They have been dealt with.

00:28.580 --> 00:30.980
Why do you wear that foreign garb?

00:31.020 --> 00:33.179
Because I am many things.

00:33.180 --> 00:35.979
Physician. Traveller.

00:35.980 --> 00:38.820
Alchemist? That's what they say.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.380
What is in the box?

00:43.420 --> 00:46.020
My greatest achievement.

00:46.060 --> 00:50.739
Something that will one day save
this fragile kingdom from itself.

00:50.740 --> 00:53.699
Your secrets are safe here.
I hope...

00:55.820 --> 00:58.380
The King thanks you for your
service.

01:42.220 --> 01:46.140
I know you're there.
Show yourself.

01:51.260 --> 01:52.660
Well, who is it?

01:52.700 --> 01:56.700
Well... I..I don't know. I mean,

01:56.740 --> 01:59.460
they've been following
me for several days.

02:01.420 --> 02:04.099
Have you ruffled anyone's
feathers lately?

02:04.100 --> 02:06.460
Well, I did have had some rather
radical ideas about the

02:06.500 --> 02:09.139
impact of the Romans on the local
textile industry.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.179
It-it caused a terrible stir.

02:11.180 --> 02:12.740
That's a no, then.

02:12.780 --> 02:14.620
Now, there you go.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.020
Most kind.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.500
There is one possibility.

02:23.380 --> 02:25.140
Professor?

02:25.180 --> 02:26.980
Oh, it may be nothing,

02:27.020 --> 02:32.100
but I think it all started after I
came into possession of this.

02:32.140 --> 02:33.660
What is it?

02:33.700 --> 02:37.099
It's the secret diary of the
university's architect.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.859
Which would make it over
300 years old.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.499
Why would someone be bothering you
over a silly old book?

02:42.500 --> 02:44.660
This is no mere historical document.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.579
The diary claims that someone in the
King's inner circle discovered

02:47.580 --> 02:51.980
the secret of alchemy - the method
of turning base metals into gold.

02:52.020 --> 02:53.980
Oh, by magic!

02:54.020 --> 02:55.220
Or science.

02:56.620 --> 02:59.899
Nowadays, we'd probably call him
a chemist, not an alchemist.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.820
It also claims the secret is
hidden at the university.

03:02.860 --> 03:04.340
Super! Does it say where?

03:06.540 --> 03:08.020
Not explicitly.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.500
You look very tired, Professor.

03:15.100 --> 03:17.979
Feeling like
a marked man is wearing me down.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.220
I don't sleep,
I'm not eating properly.

03:22.180 --> 03:23.860
How can we help?

03:45.860 --> 03:47.859
Hargreaves.

03:47.860 --> 03:52.100
Principal, Professor Ambrose asks if
he can borrow the Magister's Key.

03:52.140 --> 03:54.100
Really? Why?

03:54.140 --> 03:57.219
He thought it may be the one
referred to in the diary.

03:57.220 --> 03:59.380
An intriguing hypothesis.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.140
Very well.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.899
Good luck.

04:18.940 --> 04:20.380
Thank you, sir.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.219
They'll have this place destroyed!

04:26.220 --> 04:27.299
Exactly.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.260
They should be in the
philosophy department,

04:29.300 --> 04:31.500
yet here they are
in pre-16th century theology.

04:34.180 --> 04:37.100
Excuse me, I wondered if I might
have a word with Professor Ambrose?

04:37.140 --> 04:39.020
Come right in.

04:39.060 --> 04:42.460
Professor, I tried to get hold
of the Principal.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.740
Oh, why?

04:46.180 --> 04:49.140
You asked me to speak to him.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.380
Oh, yes. Of course.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.220
He's in a meeting all morning,
but I'll keep trying.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.260
Is this to do with the diary?

04:58.580 --> 05:00.340
You know about that?

05:00.380 --> 05:03.819
We-we can trust these people.
Tell them what's been happening.

05:03.820 --> 05:07.460
The diary claims that the location
of the Alchemist's secret was

05:07.500 --> 05:10.779
hidden in a riddle given to the
King's closest advisors.

05:10.780 --> 05:13.020
Could they not just have
drawn a map?

05:13.060 --> 05:14.379
Oh, no, no, no!

05:14.380 --> 05:17.019
This was a time when men of
intellect were required to

05:17.020 --> 05:19.299
prove their worth.
Well, what's the riddle?

05:19.300 --> 05:21.699
"The Key to the Lock to the Door."

05:21.700 --> 05:25.180
The Principal holds an old key as
part of his ceremonial items.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.980
It dates back to the
17th century,

05:27.020 --> 05:28.660
when the university was built.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.499
Good idea. We-we should get hold of
it.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.860
I'll try, Professor.
A pleasure to meet you all.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.100
Yes.

05:37.940 --> 05:41.660
Ladies, have you seen the sights of
this magnificent university?

05:41.700 --> 05:45.259
The great hall, the library,
the gardens?

05:45.260 --> 05:48.579
Oh, how wearisome. Can't we just go
and help "Cheekbones" instead?

05:48.580 --> 05:51.500
No, no. Father Brown is quite right.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.940
We should see all the sights
while we're here.

05:57.660 --> 05:59.060
Hilary...

06:00.500 --> 06:03.580
How long have you been
having problems with your memory?

06:06.180 --> 06:08.380
He's losing his mind, isn't he?

06:08.420 --> 06:12.620
Father Brown or Ambrose?
Either way, the answer is yes.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.500
Oh, that poor man.

06:18.380 --> 06:19.660
Somebody's forced this.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.700
There was a fuss the other day,
I was scheduled to give a lecture

06:29.740 --> 06:31.340
and I...

06:31.380 --> 06:32.780
I completely forgot.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.299
It's a cruel trick of nature,

06:36.300 --> 06:41.660
this brain which made my career,
deserting me in my twilight years.

06:44.180 --> 06:47.580
I think this business with the diary
has been playing havoc with

06:47.620 --> 06:49.020
my nerves.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.660
Who found it?

06:54.940 --> 06:56.700
Timothy Hargreaves.

06:56.740 --> 06:58.860
The boy who was here earlier.

06:58.900 --> 07:02.420
He wanted me to confirm that it
was... That it was authentic.

07:03.660 --> 07:06.579
Does anyone else know about it?

07:06.580 --> 07:08.659
Just the Principal.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.740
We're keeping quiet until the
official announcement.

07:13.540 --> 07:16.620
The person who
has been following you...

07:16.660 --> 07:17.860
Yes...?

07:19.900 --> 07:22.940
Do you think you might be
imagining it?

07:22.980 --> 07:24.380
I know what I saw!

07:28.100 --> 07:30.860
Once again - we didn't do anything.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.460
I can repeat it in French if it
will get the message across.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.660
Oh, just doing a spot of spring
cleaning, were you?

07:35.700 --> 07:38.340
Not really my department.
What's going on here?

07:38.380 --> 07:40.619
I discovered these intruders
trying to break into the

07:40.620 --> 07:42.059
trophy cabinet.

07:42.060 --> 07:46.739
We are not intruders,
we are friends of Professor Ambrose.

07:46.740 --> 07:49.940
This porter of yours
has got the wrong end of the stick.

07:49.980 --> 07:51.340
I caught them red-handed.

07:51.380 --> 07:54.579
Please,
let us not descend into squabbling.

07:54.580 --> 07:58.260
Penelope Windermere, The Countess of
Montague's niece. How do you do?

07:58.300 --> 08:00.300
Malcolm Pendle, Principal.

08:00.340 --> 08:03.020
We were just admiring this
marvellous hall and we

08:03.060 --> 08:05.980
noticed someone had broken the lock.

08:06.020 --> 08:08.220
There's nothing of any
real value here.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.899
We just dug out whatever cups and
medals we could find,

08:10.900 --> 08:14.139
to celebrate 100 years of the
university athletic team.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.740
Anything been taken?

08:15.780 --> 08:17.380
One of the old medals has gone.

08:20.060 --> 08:22.460
I am fed up with these
student pranks.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.460
I believe this is a police matter.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.100
We're not calling the police for the
sake of a piece of old tin!

08:29.420 --> 08:32.980
Obviously these ladies had nothing
whatever to do with what happened here.

08:33.020 --> 08:37.299
And as friends of Professor Ambrose,
we must extend them every courtesy.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.860
If you insist.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.219
I do.

08:41.220 --> 08:45.420
Now, if you'll excuse me, ladies,
I have business to attend to.

08:50.180 --> 08:53.139
The professors may think there's
a golden aura around you but I

08:53.140 --> 08:54.940
see you for what you are.

08:54.980 --> 08:56.580
We could have made a great team.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.379
Just think,
with my looks and your hostility,

08:59.380 --> 09:02.060
just think how successful our
children would be.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.939
That's the problem with
pretty boys -

09:06.940 --> 09:10.059
their charms only last till they
get what they want.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.540
What on earth goes on inside
that head of yours?

09:19.820 --> 09:22.260
"The Key to the Lock to the Door."

09:24.860 --> 09:26.140
Key. Lock. Door.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.700
Door, lock, key?

09:30.740 --> 09:33.340
Professor, do you have any milk?

10:04.020 --> 10:07.660
Hello, Timothy?
Is Professor Ambrose with you?

10:09.180 --> 10:10.540
Hello?

10:31.260 --> 10:32.620
Have you got the diary?

10:34.540 --> 10:37.219
It-it-it's gone.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.419
Professor, are you all right?

10:39.420 --> 10:41.859
I'm very well, thank you very much.
And yourself?

10:41.860 --> 10:43.220
Is this chap bothering you?

10:43.260 --> 10:45.460
I stopped him going in the water.
Again.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.860
Where has Father Brown got to?

10:47.900 --> 10:49.500
Who?

10:49.540 --> 10:53.779
Professor Ambrose thinks he may have
lost something. An old diary.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.420
Oh, yes?

10:55.460 --> 10:57.020
It's valuable.

10:57.060 --> 10:59.099
Well, WE haven't seen it.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.460
Professor,
let's get you back to your rooms.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.979
Thank you.
That's it.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.980
Look after him.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.540
Requiescat in pace.

11:15.140 --> 11:16.500
Amen.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.459
Hello.

11:22.460 --> 11:26.660
What's happened? Is..is that
Timothy?

11:26.700 --> 11:29.139
Is... Is he...?

11:29.140 --> 11:30.340
Yes.

11:35.660 --> 11:39.900
I wonder if you'll be on the scene
as quickly when I drop dead, Padre?

11:40.940 --> 11:43.140
Have some respect.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.980
Please, Father, into the corridor.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.260
What ARE you doing here?

11:54.140 --> 11:56.340
I was looking for a friend of mine.

11:57.780 --> 11:59.019
And you are?

11:59.020 --> 12:02.340
I'm just passing. I'll be off.
I don't think so.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.139
Name?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.620
Victoria Nicholson.

12:05.660 --> 12:09.619
Thank goodness you're here. My
secretary told me what's happened.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.580
Oh, my...

12:11.620 --> 12:13.820
It's quite a little party we're
gathering.

12:13.860 --> 12:17.460
I'm Malcolm Pendle, Principal
of the university.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.739
Please, tell me anything that
I can do to help.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.540
Do you have a spare room we can use?

12:21.580 --> 12:23.659
Can't have everyone standing
around out here.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.820
Biology labs are just
around the corner.

12:25.860 --> 12:28.500
I have a seminar to get to.
You'll have to miss it.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.700
No. I had to fight hard to get here.

12:30.740 --> 12:32.700
I'm not going to start
missing classes.

12:32.740 --> 12:34.540
I'll inform your tutors,

12:34.580 --> 12:38.139
make sure they fill you in on
whatever you miss.

12:38.140 --> 12:40.100
So, you found the body, Padre?

12:41.260 --> 12:44.980
Yes, I did.
He couldn't have been there long.

12:46.260 --> 12:49.539
He came to see Professor Ambrose
about an hour ago.

12:49.540 --> 12:52.459
That must have been soon after
he left my office.

12:52.460 --> 12:55.660
He wanted to borrow the
Magister's Key.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.500
The what?

12:57.540 --> 12:58.900
It's a ceremonial item,

12:58.940 --> 13:02.740
something that gets handed down when
somebody new assumes my post.

13:02.780 --> 13:06.100
But he told us that
he couldn't find you.

13:06.140 --> 13:08.699
Are you sure he had this key?

13:08.700 --> 13:09.980
Oh, absolutely.

13:10.020 --> 13:13.060
Well, he hasn't got it now.
His pockets are empty.

13:14.580 --> 13:16.140
This way.

13:20.380 --> 13:21.460
Will this do?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.740
Yes. We need to take statements.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.339
What is that doing here?!

13:29.340 --> 13:31.620
Professor Griffin believes in
a hands-on approach

13:31.660 --> 13:33.020
to teaching biology.

13:35.340 --> 13:38.140
Looks like you've made a friend.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.979
Just stay in here and keep out
of my way, Padre.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.539
Do you need me?

13:42.540 --> 13:46.380
If not, I should telephone and offer
my sympathies to the boy's parents.

13:46.420 --> 13:47.660
Fine.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.499
The sergeant will be through to
take your statements.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.780
I didn't see anything.

14:04.980 --> 14:06.540
Were you close to Timothy?

14:08.220 --> 14:11.420
Not really. We had some history
classes together.

14:14.900 --> 14:17.300
Did he ever mention an old diary?

14:19.420 --> 14:21.260
No.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.460
I'm afraid this area is out of
bounds, sir.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.900
I heard what happened.

14:28.940 --> 14:31.940
I've been porter at this university
for over three decades.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.539
I know what goes on here
better than anybody.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.979
Is that so?

14:35.980 --> 14:38.940
Then, can you think of anyone who
might have done this?

14:41.100 --> 14:43.619
He's moved them again.
While I was out.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.179
Oh, look.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.860
What have you got there?

14:47.900 --> 14:50.220
There you are, thank goodness.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.020
And what's HE doing here?

14:54.500 --> 14:58.780
The boy we met earlier, Timothy
Hargreaves...

15:00.620 --> 15:03.060
He's been murdered. Oh!

15:08.340 --> 15:13.580
Professor...
is that yours?

15:13.620 --> 15:15.219
Ah, no, no.

15:15.220 --> 15:17.460
I believe this belongs to the...
to the Principal.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.299
The last time anyone saw that key,
Hargreaves had it.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.139
So how did it get here?

15:22.140 --> 15:23.979
He found it. I saw just him.

15:23.980 --> 15:26.340
Maybe that's what
he wants you to think.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.820
I gather he's been prone to sudden
mood shifts recently.

15:29.860 --> 15:32.499
Only this morning, he was seen
wandering around the college,

15:32.500 --> 15:33.900
lost and confused.

15:33.940 --> 15:35.540
Oh, yes, and who told you that?

15:35.580 --> 15:37.099
I think we can guess.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.140
It all paints
a pretty vivid picture.

15:40.260 --> 15:44.820
Professor Ambrose means
no harm to anyone.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.300
I just go where the
evidence leads me.

15:52.820 --> 15:56.259
Timothy Hargreaves had
a cut on his cheek.

15:56.260 --> 15:58.660
Have you considered how he got it?

15:58.700 --> 16:00.100
In the struggle.

16:03.380 --> 16:08.100
In a struggle, Timothy would have
easily overpowered him.

16:11.340 --> 16:12.900
Oh, what's happening?

16:14.460 --> 16:17.739
Hilary Ambrose, I am arresting you
for the murder of

16:17.740 --> 16:19.180
Timothy Hargreaves.

16:19.220 --> 16:22.219
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

16:22.220 --> 16:25.700
but whatever you say may be written
down and given in evidence.

16:27.740 --> 16:29.979
We need to find out who framed him.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.940
Are you sure that's what happened?

16:31.980 --> 16:34.660
I mean, the Professor hasn't been
himself lately.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.499
Professor Ambrose is my friend.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.940
Oh, there was that girl having some
kind of disagreement with Timothy.

16:41.980 --> 16:44.820
Disagreement?
She slapped him into tomorrow.

16:46.140 --> 16:47.580
Dark hair?

16:47.620 --> 16:49.060
About five foot five?

16:49.100 --> 16:50.500
You've met her?

16:50.540 --> 16:54.340
Whoever planted the key in Ambrose's
room knew the significance of

16:54.380 --> 16:56.380
the riddle.

16:56.420 --> 16:59.180
We need to find out how many people
know about the diary.

16:59.220 --> 17:01.099
Well, that porter swine for one.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.860
He asked if we'd seen it.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.940
Where is it now?
Do the police have it?

17:11.220 --> 17:13.020
I may have accidentally borrowed it.

17:13.060 --> 17:16.500
Professor Ambrose left it when
he disappeared.

17:16.540 --> 17:20.339
That's awfully sly of you,
Father. I do approve.

17:20.380 --> 17:23.460
Mrs McCarthy,
will you talk to the porter?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.659
Find out what he knows about it.

17:25.660 --> 17:28.140
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

17:28.180 --> 17:32.139
How could he tell the Inspector that
Ambrose was losing the plot?

17:32.140 --> 17:34.620
The main thing is to find out
what he knows.

17:36.660 --> 17:39.380
We'll meet back here.
Right.

17:48.380 --> 17:49.580
May I have a word?

17:49.620 --> 17:51.180
Father Brown, do.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.180
The police told
me about Professor Ambrose.

17:57.220 --> 18:00.740
Please let me know if there's
anything that I can do to help.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.419
I don't think he's responsible
for what happened.

18:03.420 --> 18:05.619
Well, I know it must be hard
to accept,

18:05.620 --> 18:08.580
but the police seemed quite
convinced.

18:08.620 --> 18:12.740
Timothy lied to Ambrose,
pretending he didn't have the key.

18:14.140 --> 18:19.860
Hargreaves was a talented
undergraduate but not without ego.

18:20.940 --> 18:24.740
Perhaps he was hoping to solve the
riddle for himself.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.460
Has anyone ever tried to see
where the key fits?

18:30.500 --> 18:33.060
My wife took an interest
a few years ago.

18:33.100 --> 18:37.340
Tried the key in every lock in the
university, but without success.

18:37.380 --> 18:40.380
Would it be possible to
speak with her?

18:40.420 --> 18:43.420
She passed away.
18 months ago.

18:44.860 --> 18:46.660
I'm very sorry.

18:46.700 --> 18:50.700
Struck down by her own failing
body before her time.

18:50.740 --> 18:53.540
Such a... Such a pointless waste.

18:56.220 --> 18:59.019
When things like that happen, God...

18:59.020 --> 19:02.100
With respect, I think it's too late
for God to help her now.

19:03.980 --> 19:06.180
That's rather magnificent.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.420
It's the original plan for the
university.

19:10.460 --> 19:13.220
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lot to sort out.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.300
Yes, of course.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.580
Thank you.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.740
Now, the boy had the key,

19:24.780 --> 19:29.140
then he died and somehow it
ended up in your room.

19:29.180 --> 19:31.219
Just explain that to me.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.619
I don't know.

19:33.620 --> 19:39.060
The porter said he saw you wandering
around in a daze this morning.

19:40.140 --> 19:43.140
What can you tell me about that?

19:43.180 --> 19:46.380
Oh... I can't remember!

19:48.260 --> 19:51.819
I'll be honest - if you don't give
me something to work with,

19:51.820 --> 19:53.220
then I can't help you.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.940
Did I hurt that poor boy?

19:59.420 --> 20:03.500
As things stand...
I have to say it looks that way.

20:05.300 --> 20:08.100
Oh...
How shall I live with myself?

20:10.100 --> 20:12.900
Perhaps confessing would help
ease the burden?

20:18.620 --> 20:20.260
He's here!

20:21.780 --> 20:23.060
Who?

20:23.100 --> 20:24.780
The shadow was...

20:24.820 --> 20:28.260
Well, perhaps he could wait outside
while we finish up?

20:38.820 --> 20:41.220
Hurry, before he comes back.

20:41.260 --> 20:42.660
I was right!

20:42.700 --> 20:44.339
Oh, but of course.

20:44.340 --> 20:47.140
We couldn't even find that porter,
but you managed to solve the

20:47.180 --> 20:51.619
murder and crack a 300-year-old
mystery while we were gone?

20:51.620 --> 20:54.420
No, no,
but I think I understand the riddle.

20:55.900 --> 20:59.700
"The Key to the Lock to the Door",
refers to three separate puzzles.

20:59.740 --> 21:01.700
The key, the lock and the door.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.780
But if the killer was trying to
solve it, then why leave the

21:05.820 --> 21:08.059
Magister's Key in Ambrose's room?

21:08.060 --> 21:10.099
Wouldn't they need it?

21:10.100 --> 21:12.540
Not if they knew what they were
looking for.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.060
Here.

21:20.340 --> 21:21.340
The key!

21:24.100 --> 21:27.500
The architect who drew this
also helped to design the riddle.

21:29.820 --> 21:33.140
The symbols over the buildings are
referred to in the key with

21:33.180 --> 21:34.860
one exception...

21:37.300 --> 21:38.500
The library.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.380
I don't know how...

21:47.460 --> 21:51.500
..trying to solve an ancient riddle
is going to help Ambrose.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.580
If the real killer is attempting to
do the same,

21:58.620 --> 22:00.900
then that will lead us to him.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.500
Or her.

22:06.140 --> 22:08.380
Is that the girl you saw
talking to Timothy?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.420
I'll see you in a moment.

22:16.940 --> 22:18.140
Miss Nicholson...

22:19.980 --> 22:21.780
..may I have a word?

22:21.820 --> 22:23.420
I have a lecture to get to.

22:28.900 --> 22:33.820
My friends say they saw you with
Timothy, just before he died.

22:33.860 --> 22:36.620
Apparently you were rather
upset with him.

22:40.580 --> 22:42.020
Yes, I was angry with him.

22:43.940 --> 22:48.020
We had a brief,
misguided fling that ended badly.

22:50.260 --> 22:51.740
This place, Thorndike...

22:53.580 --> 22:55.300
How do you know about it?

22:55.340 --> 22:56.820
I don't know what you mean.

23:03.660 --> 23:08.100
It's mentioned in this diary that
you said you knew nothing about.

23:11.380 --> 23:13.580
When did Timothy let you read it?

23:13.620 --> 23:15.900
Look, he wasn't the one who
found it. I did.

23:15.940 --> 23:17.620
Ah...

23:19.540 --> 23:21.060
Where?

23:21.100 --> 23:24.540
I was going through the university
land deeds for my history project.

23:24.580 --> 23:27.180
I showed Timothy,
and he stole it from me.

23:28.500 --> 23:32.260
I know there was no love lost
between you and Timothy,

23:32.300 --> 23:37.540
but I believe that Professor Ambrose
is being framed for his death.

23:37.580 --> 23:42.620
And in order to help him, I need to
understand what is in that diary.

23:42.660 --> 23:44.860
And that is my ONLY interest in it.

23:48.180 --> 23:49.300
So...

23:51.140 --> 23:52.460
..Thorndike...

23:59.300 --> 24:00.420
Here.

24:03.580 --> 24:06.619
"In Thorndike the Alchemist's
magic has been proven.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.860
"The King's enemies will bend
their knee before him."

24:11.740 --> 24:15.299
This is a reproduction
of a map from 1603.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.060
The village of Thorndike is here,

24:17.100 --> 24:19.580
a few miles from where
the university is now.

24:21.140 --> 24:23.540
But this one,
nearly 100 years later...

24:27.740 --> 24:28.900
It's gone.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.139
Where did it go?

24:33.140 --> 24:34.580
I don't know.

24:46.140 --> 24:47.620
What have you found?

24:48.780 --> 24:50.260
Absolutely nothing.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.139
Oh.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.540
The architect wanted
his riddle to be solved...

24:58.620 --> 25:01.820
..but a book in a public place is
liable to go missing.

25:03.380 --> 25:05.699
Perhaps he factored that
into his design.

25:05.700 --> 25:08.020
And what's that supposed to mean?

25:08.060 --> 25:12.259
Maybe we're looking for
something more permanent.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.220
Yes, and maybe we're just looking
in the wrong place.

25:20.420 --> 25:22.180
Those marks look recent.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.579
Why the long face?

25:48.580 --> 25:50.980
This may sound strange...

25:51.020 --> 25:52.859
Coming from you?

25:52.860 --> 25:57.340
Mrs McCarthy, don't make any sudden
moves and move slowly towards me.

25:59.780 --> 26:00.940
Why?

26:04.660 --> 26:06.779
He's magnificent!

26:06.780 --> 26:08.899
Is that thing poisonous?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.100
I'm not sure.

26:11.340 --> 26:12.819
How will we get past?

26:12.820 --> 26:14.940
Perhaps we should feed it something.

26:16.020 --> 26:17.060
That's a good idea.

26:18.580 --> 26:20.059
If we had a mouse...

26:20.060 --> 26:24.300
Oh, yes, of course, I'll go to
the mouse dispenser, shall I?

26:24.340 --> 26:30.499
Or, um, we could distract it and
then get behind it and pick it up

26:30.500 --> 26:32.620
by the neck.

26:32.660 --> 26:34.219
It's all neck!

26:34.220 --> 26:37.100
The bit behind the head.
I don't know what it's called.

26:37.140 --> 26:39.220
And how exactly are we
going to do that?

26:40.860 --> 26:41.980
Where do you want him?

26:43.820 --> 26:45.060
Buiochas le Dia.

26:46.900 --> 26:50.300
He reminds me of this splendid
specimen we found while on

26:50.340 --> 26:51.939
safari in Kenya.

26:51.940 --> 26:53.219
I used to call him Hugh.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.540
Do we have to return him?

26:54.580 --> 26:56.380
There's that porter.

26:57.660 --> 26:58.660
I'll catch you up.

27:15.740 --> 27:17.820
Are you looking for this?

27:17.860 --> 27:18.900
How did you get that?

27:20.100 --> 27:23.020
How did you find out about
the existence of the diary?

27:24.340 --> 27:28.539
Ambrose has been asking questions
around the university.

27:28.540 --> 27:30.539
I realised then that he was trying
to solve

27:30.540 --> 27:32.979
the Alchemist's riddle again.

27:32.980 --> 27:34.900
Again?

27:34.940 --> 27:39.220
When Ambrose came to this
university, 30-odd years ago,

27:39.260 --> 27:44.340
he found the riddle in some old
correspondence with the royal court.

27:44.380 --> 27:46.139
He never told me.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.700
He'd probably forgotten.

27:47.740 --> 27:50.420
I don't know what he did with
those letters, but when Timothy

27:50.460 --> 27:55.300
gave him that diary, well, he
started that search all over again.

27:55.340 --> 27:59.619
I tried to take it from him, but
he wouldn't let it out of his sight.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.420
He thought you were a phantom!

28:01.460 --> 28:05.619
When Ambrose first tried to solve
the riddle, well,

28:05.620 --> 28:06.900
he became obsessed.

28:08.060 --> 28:09.140
Then what happened?

28:10.580 --> 28:14.020
One day, he just stopped searching.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.740
But he had a look in his eyes that
I haven't seen since the trenches.

28:19.620 --> 28:21.060
Absolute, helpless fear.

28:22.340 --> 28:24.500
And I don't want him to
rediscover why.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.820
You told the police he'd been
behaving erratically.

28:28.860 --> 28:31.260
It's the truth.

28:31.300 --> 28:34.300
But what you said could
have him hanged.

28:35.460 --> 28:36.940
I like Ambrose,

28:36.980 --> 28:40.820
but if he's responsible, then
Timothy's family deserve justice.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.460
Now, give me the diary...

28:47.580 --> 28:48.940
..and I will destroy it.

28:50.340 --> 28:55.380
I can't. Because the information in
this could save my friend.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.340
Make it quick.

29:01.380 --> 29:03.980
A few Hail Marys,
then I want you out of here.

29:12.140 --> 29:15.740
Hello, my friend. How are you?

29:18.420 --> 29:19.740
Please tell me the truth.

29:21.180 --> 29:22.460
Did I kill him?

29:22.500 --> 29:23.660
No.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.580
Would you swear that on the Bible?

29:26.940 --> 29:27.980
Oh.

29:29.220 --> 29:30.580
He's followed me here.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.619
Whom?

29:36.620 --> 29:39.500
The Alchemist,
with his beaked mask

29:39.540 --> 29:43.820
and his-his... magic.

29:45.020 --> 29:50.379
We found a carving in
the library of Janus's head.

29:50.380 --> 29:54.140
One side facing towards the future,
one side facing towards the past.

29:54.180 --> 29:56.340
Yes, Janus, the God of transitions.

29:56.380 --> 30:00.620
He acts as a barrier between
this place and the next.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.820
Isn't he also the God of Doors?

30:06.340 --> 30:10.460
One of his faces was on the medal,
it was all bathed in moonlight.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.939
That was the King's copy.

30:13.940 --> 30:17.100
I threw it in the lake.
A long time ago.

30:18.540 --> 30:19.540
Why?

30:20.780 --> 30:23.180
Oh, no. Oh, please.

30:25.140 --> 30:27.140
Help! Help!

30:29.940 --> 30:32.740
Out, Padre. You're upsetting him.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.580
He shouldn't be left alone.

30:34.620 --> 30:35.860
Out!

30:53.340 --> 30:57.260
I had to tell him all I knew.
He's my friend.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.380
No! No!

31:16.420 --> 31:21.939
What did Professor Ambrose know
about the carving in the library?

31:21.940 --> 31:25.779
He said he saw one of
the faces on a medal.

31:25.780 --> 31:29.820
Well, there was a medal stolen from
the display case in the Great Hall.

31:29.860 --> 31:34.100
Professor Ambrose said he'd thrown
it into the lake a long time ago.

31:34.140 --> 31:37.940
Yet the display case wasn't broken
into until this morning.

31:42.420 --> 31:45.860
Well, can't sit around here
all day drinking tea.

31:45.900 --> 31:48.099
Hooray for that!
What are we going to do?

31:48.100 --> 31:52.380
I'm going to shake the tree and see
what falls out.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.980
You wanted to see me, Principal.

32:02.740 --> 32:04.579
Actually, that was me.

32:04.580 --> 32:07.619
I'm glad you could join us,
thank you.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.620
Make yourself at home.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.819
Not now, girl.
This isn't a good moment.

32:15.820 --> 32:19.660
And I asked Victoria if she could
join us as well.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.220
Do come in.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.060
What's going on?

32:27.100 --> 32:30.419
As far as I know, you are the only
members of the university who

32:30.420 --> 32:33.060
know about the existence of
the diary.

32:34.460 --> 32:35.940
What of it?

32:35.980 --> 32:39.620
Ever since it showed up,
a kind of madness has descended.

32:42.020 --> 32:46.180
I propose that we work together to
solve the puzzle.

32:47.620 --> 32:53.900
And then whoever killed Timothy will
have no reason to harm anyone else.

32:53.940 --> 32:56.700
Are you saying one of us
murdered him?

32:58.060 --> 33:01.620
I think we should all just forget we
ever heard this cursed riddle.

33:01.660 --> 33:03.460
I don't think that's very likely.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.100
Sorry if I'm being naive,

33:06.140 --> 33:08.940
but how do you fit into this?

33:08.980 --> 33:12.419
I have some crucial information
the rest of you don't.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.420
Something Ambrose told me.

33:14.460 --> 33:18.260
But to use it I need the medal that
was stolen from the Great Hall.

33:22.260 --> 33:26.140
Ambrose told me that
he got rid of the King's medal.

33:28.060 --> 33:33.340
But I think there was another medal
that showed Janus's other head.

33:34.820 --> 33:38.140
I think that belonged to
the Alchemist.

33:51.740 --> 33:52.980
Thank you.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.419
What do the medals do?

33:56.420 --> 34:01.620
On the medal Ambrose threw into the
lake, Janus was looking at the moon.

34:02.980 --> 34:06.820
In this one,
he's looking at the sun.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.500
What's he doing?

34:18.540 --> 34:20.860
It marks the journey from
night to day.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.020
Now what?

34:37.340 --> 34:39.820
It's at the wrong angle to
tell the time now.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.980
But now it's telling us
something else.

34:42.020 --> 34:43.219
Where's it pointing?

34:46.260 --> 34:47.860
The Great Hall.

34:51.540 --> 34:53.179
Over there.

34:56.420 --> 34:59.219
Here! There's... There's a catch.

34:59.220 --> 35:00.060
Don't!

35:00.100 --> 35:01.499
Nothing good will come of this.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.300
It's too late, Crawford.

35:03.340 --> 35:04.340
Look.

35:24.980 --> 35:26.060
Look.

35:31.460 --> 35:32.900
Here, use my matches.

35:35.540 --> 35:36.620
Wait.

35:42.220 --> 35:43.300
This way.

35:47.540 --> 35:51.100
Looks like something's been burnt.
Most probably paper.

35:58.100 --> 35:59.979
Something's wrong.

35:59.980 --> 36:02.499
That lantern's too modern.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.620
Open the box.

36:04.860 --> 36:05.900
Stop.

36:07.740 --> 36:08.900
Listen to the priest.

36:11.180 --> 36:12.180
Give it here.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.700
Haven't you done enough damage?

36:20.740 --> 36:22.300
What do you mean?

36:22.340 --> 36:27.140
I think you found the carving in
the library this morning.

36:28.980 --> 36:31.460
You knew that I was on
the right trail.

36:32.700 --> 36:36.740
But when you remembered where you'd
seen Janus's face before

36:36.780 --> 36:38.180
it was too late.

36:39.620 --> 36:40.740
The medal had gone.

36:43.060 --> 36:47.459
Ambrose was always very open about
his investigation

36:47.460 --> 36:51.420
so he would have told you
anything he'd found,

36:51.460 --> 36:54.780
and you reasoned Timothy must
have taken it.

36:56.060 --> 36:57.660
But I had the medal.

36:57.700 --> 36:58.700
Yes.

37:00.260 --> 37:03.899
You killed Timothy Hargreaves
because you mistakenly thought

37:03.900 --> 37:07.340
he was the only other person who
knew about the medal.

37:09.180 --> 37:10.460
Is this true?

37:12.660 --> 37:14.460
I didn't want to hurt him.

37:16.580 --> 37:18.580
'I waited in his room till
he came back.'

37:21.660 --> 37:22.820
What are you doing?

37:22.860 --> 37:24.340
Shut the door.

37:24.380 --> 37:26.300
'I lost my temper.'

37:26.340 --> 37:28.940
Where is it? What?

37:29.980 --> 37:30.980
The medal.

37:32.220 --> 37:34.380
I don't know what you're
talking about.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.700
I won't ask again. The medal!

37:38.740 --> 37:39.939
You hit me.

37:39.940 --> 37:41.260
Don't test my patience!

37:42.580 --> 37:45.819
I'll make sure people know about
this. Father will tell everyone.

37:45.820 --> 37:47.380
Give it to me!

37:47.420 --> 37:49.780
You're finished. I'll have your job.
Take everything you....

37:57.220 --> 37:59.380
I swear I didn't mean to do it.

37:59.420 --> 38:02.260
But the next thing you did was
quite deliberate.

38:04.620 --> 38:09.179
You planted the key in
Professor Ambrose's room.

38:09.180 --> 38:10.740
I panicked.

38:10.780 --> 38:13.859
I knew that anyone investigating
would discover Ambrose's interest

38:13.860 --> 38:16.699
in the riddle, so it would be easy
to lay the blame at his feet.

38:16.700 --> 38:19.139
But I thought because of his
condition, no-one would try

38:19.140 --> 38:20.420
to prosecute him.

38:20.460 --> 38:21.940
You took advantage of an ill man.

38:21.980 --> 38:24.580
I've done wrong. I know that.

38:24.620 --> 38:26.420
But I mean to make up for it.

38:26.460 --> 38:29.860
That's convenient,
now you've been found out.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.939
What's done is done.

38:31.940 --> 38:36.740
Think of all the good I could do
with what we've found here.

38:36.780 --> 38:41.060
Um... Principal, there is no gold.

38:42.820 --> 38:43.820
What?

38:45.140 --> 38:47.500
Professor Ambrose has already
been here.

38:50.620 --> 38:51.820
This is his lantern.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.660
He discovered
the secret 30 years ago.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.820
He burnt these papers.

39:04.460 --> 39:07.260
Because he didn't want anyone to
know what they contained.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.099
The idiot!

39:09.100 --> 39:10.580
Why didn't he take the box?

39:11.740 --> 39:14.780
Because he feared that what it
contained was too dangerous

39:14.820 --> 39:16.419
to be removed.

39:16.420 --> 39:19.620
No. He's wrong.

39:22.820 --> 39:27.140
I beg you, Principal, I beg you,
do not go any further.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.660
Professor Ambrose talked about
a man in a beaked mask.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.100
Like a plague doctor?

39:37.740 --> 39:39.820
Yes, exactly.

39:42.220 --> 39:48.100
I think the Alchemist worked out how
to use a plague as a weapon.

39:49.340 --> 39:51.380
And that was his secret.

39:51.420 --> 39:54.580
That's where the village of
Thorndike went!

39:54.620 --> 39:58.020
It disappears from maps
cos there was no-one left alive.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.820
It's where he tested it.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.260
Lies.

40:01.300 --> 40:02.539
No!

40:02.540 --> 40:03.740
Keep away.

40:06.260 --> 40:12.460
What if the box contains
the last remaining samples of

40:12.500 --> 40:14.180
the Alchemist's experiment?

40:15.540 --> 40:19.780
It would kill the four of us
at the very least.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.820
I have to know the truth.

40:23.860 --> 40:25.460
But you're better than that.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
It's too late to save me.

40:27.540 --> 40:29.300
God will forgive you.

40:29.340 --> 40:30.540
But I won't.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.900
Is this what your wife
would have wanted?

40:37.060 --> 40:40.100
That our loved ones suffer
the same pain that you did.

40:50.820 --> 40:53.460
I thought I could have done
so much good with it.

41:28.460 --> 41:32.380
This secret must remain buried.
Are we all agreed?

41:32.420 --> 41:34.300
Yes. I promise.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.780
What do we do with him?

41:39.620 --> 41:44.340
We cannot explain anything to
the police without telling them

41:44.380 --> 41:46.300
what we found.

41:46.340 --> 41:50.780
I know what I have to do,
but I'm a coward.

41:52.420 --> 41:54.380
How will you live with yourself?

41:56.300 --> 41:58.100
I'm afraid of what they'll do to me.

42:00.140 --> 42:03.780
Can you return to your former life
after what's happened?

42:07.260 --> 42:09.540
You have already taken
the first step.

42:11.940 --> 42:13.580
The hardest part is behind you.

42:23.500 --> 42:29.180
Professor, we're letting you go.
We need this cell.

43:11.620 --> 43:14.739
Which of these books are essential
for you to take with you?

43:14.740 --> 43:16.500
I'd start with those and then...

43:16.540 --> 43:18.540
there's my Divinity section.

43:18.580 --> 43:20.380
And the diary, of course.

43:23.620 --> 43:25.860
Hilary, it's gone.

43:27.460 --> 43:29.300
Oh, that's such a shame.

43:32.580 --> 43:35.740
So, what will you do in
your retirement?

43:37.020 --> 43:39.220
I'll try and keep out of trouble.

43:39.260 --> 43:41.899
And my brother has a project he
wants my opinion on.

43:41.900 --> 43:43.100
Oh, what is it?

43:43.140 --> 43:45.540
Something of
a mystery at his local church.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.980
I'm not sure you should get
involved with that.

43:48.020 --> 43:50.099
Don't be ridiculous, I can't wait!

43:50.100 --> 43:53.460
There's a missing priest, a stolen
crucifix from the Middle Ages,

43:53.500 --> 43:56.500
and a trail leading from the altar.

43:56.540 --> 43:58.700
I think I shall enjoy
retirement.
