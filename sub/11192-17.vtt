WEBVTT

00:15.400 --> 00:19.147
<i>Incoming traveller.
Incoming traveller.</i>

00:19.599 --> 00:21.675
Offworld activation.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.794
Closing the iris.

00:25.237 --> 00:28.356
There's no one scheduled
to come back for 24 hours. Who is it?

00:28.356 --> 00:30.716
It's SG-1's remote access code, sir.

00:30.716 --> 00:35.011
- What? They just went through!
- Opening the iris. Stand by.

00:41.073 --> 00:44.988
Sir, the gate is drawing twice the power
as normal. And it's increasing!

00:56.472 --> 00:58.347
<i>System overload!</i>

01:01.149 --> 01:05.313
- The wormhole is disengaged!
- Get a medical team in here now!

01:06.149 --> 01:08.269
Teal'c, are you all right?

01:08.269 --> 01:09.432
I am.

01:09.469 --> 01:12.590
Where are Colonel O'Neill
and Captain Carter?

01:15.787 --> 01:18.906
They could have not been
more than two metres behind.

01:18.908 --> 01:20.984
I do not know.

03:14.965 --> 03:19.003
Dr. Jackson's still unconscious,
but Dr. Warner thinks he'll be all right.

03:19.004 --> 03:21.723
I need to know what
went on back there, Teal'c.

03:21.724 --> 03:23.515
We were under fire.

03:23.525 --> 03:28.522
Distant energy weapons of some kind.
Possibly Goa'uld technology.

03:28.522 --> 03:31.722
So it's possible O'Neill and Carter
were struck by enemy fire?

03:31.723 --> 03:35.121
I do not believe so. They were
but a few metres behind me

03:35.122 --> 03:38.920
- As we passed through the Stargate.
- How many hostiles were there?

03:38.920 --> 03:42.838
They were some distance away,
but we appeared to be surrounded.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.000
We were there only moments.
We laid down cover fire

03:46.001 --> 03:48.679
while Daniel Jackson dialled home.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.038
General, I believe they should
have made it through the gate.

03:52.038 --> 03:54.742
I do not understand why they did not.

03:58.518 --> 04:01.515
Preliminary report
on the Stargate repairs, sir.

04:01.515 --> 04:02.346
Repairs?

04:02.395 --> 04:04.754
There was an overload.
We don't know why.

04:04.756 --> 04:08.474
- I must return immediately.
- Not with an army on the other side.

04:08.475 --> 04:09.425
Sorry.

04:13.435 --> 04:16.512
General Hammond, I suggest
a second probe be sent through.

04:16.514 --> 04:20.380
As soon as the Stargate
is working again, we'll do just that.

04:22.074 --> 04:24.149
Oh, God!

04:26.872 --> 04:29.151
Agh!

04:29.151 --> 04:31.725
Colonel. Thank God.

04:33.071 --> 04:35.630
- Carter.
- Yeah. Try to stay put, sir.

04:35.632 --> 04:39.795
- I think your leg's broken.
- No, my leg's definitely broken.

04:42.949 --> 04:47.028
What's the bad news? Because unless
they've redecorated the gate room,

04:47.028 --> 04:49.507
I don't think we're in Kansas any more.

04:49.507 --> 04:51.999
Daniel must have misdialled.

04:53.346 --> 04:55.754
Misdialled?

04:56.665 --> 04:59.370
You mean this place is a wrong number?

05:01.105 --> 05:03.504
For cryin' out loud.

05:03.504 --> 05:07.184
- Where is he?
- He's not here, sir. Neither is Teal'c.

05:07.185 --> 05:10.303
- He has to be.
- I tried that.

05:11.384 --> 05:15.062
You've been unconscious
for nearly two hours.

05:15.062 --> 05:17.581
They came through the gate
before we did.

05:17.581 --> 05:21.740
I know that. I also know
that we're alone here.

05:21.742 --> 05:23.817
Wherever "here" is.

05:25.262 --> 05:27.338
Nice.

05:28.459 --> 05:30.002
- Nice.
- Yeah.

05:30.461 --> 05:33.459
I think we're inside
a deep crevasse of a glacier.

05:33.459 --> 05:37.619
If their Stargate's overrun by ice, possibly
on a planet in the middle of an ice age.

05:37.620 --> 05:42.216
Now, there is some light filtering through
up there and there are fissures in the ice,

05:42.216 --> 05:45.752
but all of them are too narrow
to follow very far.

05:47.336 --> 05:50.088
- We're in trouble, sir.
- Oh, nonsense.

05:51.215 --> 05:56.553
We'll just dial home and...
straighten... all this out.

06:00.096 --> 06:02.052
Where's the DHD?

06:02.053 --> 06:04.129
Can't find that either.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.610
Oh.

06:08.452 --> 06:11.869
So, uh... we're in trouble.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.144
<i>We're in trouble.</i>

06:28.569 --> 06:31.768
We've replaced the superconductive
interface elements, sir.

06:31.769 --> 06:35.608
The old ones all melted. It's gonna take
some time to load-test them, though.

06:35.608 --> 06:38.646
Just tell me the minute
we can send a probe through.

06:38.646 --> 06:41.047
That'll be 24 hours, General, minimum.

06:41.047 --> 06:44.564
- Carter and O'Neill do not have that long.
- I'll give you half that.

06:44.564 --> 06:48.683
No, sir. It doesn't work that way.
24 hours is the best I can do.

06:48.685 --> 06:51.444
- Then you'd better get back to it.
- Yes, sir.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.567
Come on, let's go.

06:54.764 --> 06:56.841
<i>Agh!</i>

06:58.004 --> 07:00.079
Oh, God!

07:02.642 --> 07:05.201
<i>OK. I... I think it's set.</i>

07:05.201 --> 07:07.721
- You think it's set?
- I'm positive.

07:07.721 --> 07:11.199
All we have to do is put a splint on it
and you'll be as good as new.

07:11.201 --> 07:15.319
- Just take it easy, Doctor.
- Wrong kind of doctor, I'm afraid.

07:15.321 --> 07:19.238
You wouldn't think jagged bone digging
into raw nerves would hurt, but it does.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.718
Sorry, sir, but I've never
done this before in my life.

07:22.718 --> 07:26.117
- Is this your first broken bone?
- I... I... No.

07:26.117 --> 07:28.677
This... This would be...

07:28.677 --> 07:30.254
uh...

07:30.278 --> 07:33.610
nine, if you count skull fractures.

07:35.156 --> 07:38.875
- How'd you manage that?
- A little parachuting mishap.

07:38.875 --> 07:43.336
Over the borders of Iran and Iraq
back in... eighty...

07:44.113 --> 07:46.153
Agh!

07:46.153 --> 07:48.593
OK. This is gonna hurt, sir.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.882
Agh! I know, I know, I know, I know.

07:53.752 --> 07:58.129
- So, what happened?
- I hit the ground. Go figure.

08:01.432 --> 08:02.593
Agh!

08:04.512 --> 08:11.225
My chute... opened a little late.
And it hurt... just like that.

08:11.430 --> 08:15.891
- I'm sorry. I'm doing the best I can.
- I know you are. Can you just be done?

08:16.228 --> 08:20.187
- So you hit the ground. And?
- And they all lived happily ever after.

08:20.187 --> 08:22.586
- Almost there.
- No, you're there, Captain!

08:22.588 --> 08:24.987
That's a great splint! Stop!

08:24.987 --> 08:26.814
Stop.

08:27.826 --> 08:31.076
So, how long before you were rescued?

08:32.306 --> 08:34.381
No rescue.

08:35.705 --> 08:40.283
It wasn't exactly... an official mission...

08:41.465 --> 08:44.418
if you know what I mean, so, uh...

08:45.303 --> 08:47.379
I had to make it out on my own.

08:50.861 --> 08:52.818
Nine days.

08:52.822 --> 08:54.941
Wow.

08:54.941 --> 08:57.139
What got you through it?

08:57.140 --> 08:58.221
Sara.

09:00.181 --> 09:02.299
Your wife?

09:02.301 --> 09:04.376
At the time.

09:06.058 --> 09:08.549
I had to see her again.

09:14.138 --> 09:17.297
- Tallied our supplies yet?
- Yes, sir.

09:17.298 --> 09:21.135
Supplies for three days,
but we can stretch that.

09:21.135 --> 09:25.174
We've got a little drinking water, but...

09:25.176 --> 09:26.754
- Ice melts.
- Yeah.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.654
And we've got our field
cooking gear to melt it.

09:29.655 --> 09:32.413
Flashlight batteries
are gonna be a problem.

09:32.413 --> 09:34.490
We've got thermal blankets.

09:34.494 --> 09:36.570
That's good.

09:37.293 --> 09:39.370
By the way, Captain...

09:40.773 --> 09:43.607
we are gonna get outta here -
that's an order.

09:47.052 --> 09:49.259
- How does the splint feel?
- Captain?

09:52.331 --> 09:54.822
You have to believe me.

09:55.809 --> 09:58.288
I want to, sir.

09:58.288 --> 10:00.246
I just don't see how.

10:00.249 --> 10:03.567
Then we'd better start looking for a way.

10:03.568 --> 10:07.966
Because I'll be damned if I'm gonna die
on some godforsaken block of ice

10:07.966 --> 10:10.686
a million light years from home.
Is that clear?

10:10.687 --> 10:13.644
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Now help me up.

10:13.645 --> 10:16.645
Uh... I don't think you should move.

10:16.647 --> 10:20.524
Probably not, but my butt's
freezin' to the ground. Come on.

10:20.524 --> 10:22.600
Sir.

10:36.923 --> 10:39.413
A little paint, a couple of windows...

10:40.121 --> 10:42.197
a fireplace in the corner,

10:43.480 --> 10:45.557
it'll be just like home.

10:59.119 --> 11:02.596
- Teal'c?
- The Stargate has malfunctioned.

11:02.596 --> 11:05.716
We came back through the gate
at too great a velocity.

11:08.476 --> 11:11.195
- Jack and Sam?
- They did not follow.

11:11.196 --> 11:13.318
Yes, they did.

11:14.515 --> 11:20.274
I know they did. They were right
behind us. That doesn't make any sense.

11:20.274 --> 11:22.350
I concur.

11:25.712 --> 11:30.422
In a few hours a probe will be sent back
in an attempt to determine their fate.

11:35.071 --> 11:38.106
<i>We might be able
to climb outta here.</i>

11:39.071 --> 11:40.945
<i>- You might, anyway.
- What?</i>

11:42.950 --> 11:45.736
I said you might be able
to climb outta here.

11:49.229 --> 11:51.304
Colonel!

11:51.749 --> 11:54.240
- I've found it!
- Found what?

11:55.869 --> 11:57.945
The DHD.

11:59.986 --> 12:04.625
I figure the glacial flow must have
separated the Stargate from its DHD,

12:04.625 --> 12:06.914
but it looks like it might be intact.

12:11.703 --> 12:13.495
Agh!

12:13.504 --> 12:15.580
God!

12:23.701 --> 12:25.113
Can we dig it out?

12:25.140 --> 12:29.969
Even if it doesn't work, we can melt
the chopped ice for drinking water.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.857
What's wrong with your chest?

12:37.859 --> 12:40.859
- I think I cracked a rib too.
- Why didn't you say something?

12:40.860 --> 12:43.611
I was afraid you'd try to put a splint on it.

12:44.259 --> 12:46.335
I'll be fine.

12:50.498 --> 12:53.576
I've been thinking about
where Daniel and Teal'c might be.

12:53.576 --> 12:55.653
Yeah?

12:56.336 --> 12:59.375
So far I count three possible explanations.

12:59.375 --> 13:03.053
One: Daniel misdialled and they're here,

13:03.054 --> 13:05.774
somewhere we haven't found.

13:05.774 --> 13:07.731
- I don't see 'em.
- Right.

13:07.734 --> 13:10.614
Two: Daniel didn't misdial,

13:10.614 --> 13:14.611
but for some reason the Stargate
malfunctioned during transit.

13:14.613 --> 13:17.650
Don't ask me how.
I haven't figured that part out yet.

13:17.652 --> 13:23.404
Anyway, they got sent back to Earth,
but for some reason we got sent here.

13:24.051 --> 13:28.969
- What's three?
- Three: the Stargate malfunctioned.

13:28.970 --> 13:33.009
We got sent to this planet.
Daniel and Teal'c got sent to another one.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.408
- What's four?
- There is no four.

13:35.408 --> 13:38.908
- It's after three.
- Not this time, Colonel.

13:39.687 --> 13:41.644
All right.

13:41.648 --> 13:44.221
We'll assume they made it back to Earth.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.626
They'll start sending search parties.

13:49.566 --> 13:52.400
- To where?
- Here, I hope.

13:54.044 --> 13:57.004
Where would they begin?
They have no idea where we are.

13:57.004 --> 14:01.323
With all the possible Stargates, a random
search could easily take ten years.

14:01.323 --> 14:03.802
Not if they look here first.

14:03.803 --> 14:09.282
Even if all SG teams started searching
right now, the probability of them even...

14:09.283 --> 14:11.359
Captain.

14:15.361 --> 14:17.070
I think too much.

14:24.558 --> 14:28.390
Charging circuit MX43 at 20 per cent.

14:30.958 --> 14:33.278
<i>20 per cent, sir.</i>

14:33.278 --> 14:35.355
100.

14:36.876 --> 14:40.115
Circuit is holding. Reset and stand by.

14:40.116 --> 14:43.235
- She's all yours, General.
- Well done, Sergeant.

14:43.235 --> 14:45.312
- You heard the man.
- Yes, sir.

14:54.472 --> 14:56.299
Chevron one encoded.

14:56.313 --> 14:59.232
SG-3 and I are ready
and awaiting your orders, General.

14:59.234 --> 15:03.471
I won't authorise this rescue unless
the probe sends back the right pictures.

15:03.471 --> 15:06.750
- Chevron two encoded.
- All defence teams, stay alert.

15:06.751 --> 15:11.190
These hostiles may have both
our addresses and our transmitter code.

15:11.191 --> 15:12.649
Chevron three encoded.

15:12.671 --> 15:15.308
You don't think they'd give up
the codes to the enemy?

15:15.309 --> 15:18.668
- Not willingly, no.
- Chevron four encoded.

15:18.669 --> 15:22.269
I do not believe they would do so,
even under the duress of torture.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.929
Chevron five encoded.

15:23.947 --> 15:26.628
If we find no enemy activity
on the other side,

15:26.628 --> 15:30.265
you will coordinate with Major Castleman
on the rescue mission.

15:30.267 --> 15:32.556
I understand.

15:36.904 --> 15:39.395
Chevron seven is locked.

15:48.703 --> 15:52.914
The probe should reach the Stargate
of P4A-771 in five seconds.

15:53.182 --> 15:56.432
Four... three... two...

15:56.621 --> 15:58.697
now.

16:05.620 --> 16:10.495
<i>No sign of Jack or Sam, but
no evidence they got into a firefight either.</i>

16:11.818 --> 16:16.611
<i>What are you waiting for?
Close the iris. Disengage the Stargate.</i>

16:16.979 --> 16:19.385
SG-3, stand down.

16:20.298 --> 16:23.335
- The rescue mission is scrubbed.
- General...

16:36.975 --> 16:40.653
- Soup's on.
- Just a little more. I'm almost through.

16:40.653 --> 16:44.188
Come on, now.
You don't want it to get cold.

16:55.451 --> 16:57.527
I didn't know you could cook.

16:58.171 --> 17:02.335
I can't. But my melted ice is to die for.

17:03.808 --> 17:05.884
Thank you.

17:09.209 --> 17:11.487
Sir, maybe I should
have another look at you.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.564
No, I'm fine. Eat.

17:17.606 --> 17:21.483
I've been thinking about how
the Stargate might have malfunctioned.

17:21.486 --> 17:22.647
Yeah?

17:22.685 --> 17:26.766
Well, we don't totally
understand how it works.

17:26.766 --> 17:30.884
But the theory we have so far is that
the gate creates an artificial wormhole

17:30.884 --> 17:34.242
that somehow transfers an energised
matter stream in one direction

17:34.243 --> 17:36.319
along an extradimensional conduit.

17:36.324 --> 17:39.762
I think the matter stream
between Stargates got redirected,

17:39.762 --> 17:44.361
kind of like a lightning bolt jumping
from one point to another in mid-strike.

17:44.362 --> 17:49.641
Now, I figure it had to have been
the attack on P4A-771.

17:49.642 --> 17:53.319
The gate itself was probably struck
by enough energy during the firefight

17:53.319 --> 17:58.659
to influence the direction of the matter
stream before we reached the other side.

18:00.199 --> 18:02.275
Colonel?

18:03.198 --> 18:05.689
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

18:07.597 --> 18:11.155
What I'm saying is... we must have
emerged through a Stargate

18:11.156 --> 18:13.836
relatively close to Earth
in the gate network,

18:13.836 --> 18:17.036
somewhere between P4A-771 and Earth.

18:17.036 --> 18:20.354
Now, if the SG rescue teams
reach the same conclusion,

18:20.355 --> 18:24.034
- It could significantly narrow their search.
- That's good news.

18:24.035 --> 18:25.909
Yeah.

18:30.673 --> 18:32.166
OK.

18:32.193 --> 18:36.487
So if they are not there
and they are not here...

18:38.632 --> 18:42.499
It is possible they may have
perished within the wormhole.

18:43.671 --> 18:47.621
Yeah, in which case they're gone.
I know. I thought of that.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.786
But if they are alive...

18:53.710 --> 18:58.307
if there's a possibility this malfunction
sent them to a different Stargate...

18:58.307 --> 19:00.787
Was it not Captain Carter who deduced

19:00.788 --> 19:05.507
the possible combination of Stargate
symbols numbered in the millions?

19:05.507 --> 19:07.583
Yeah.

19:08.145 --> 19:10.387
Well, we have to narrow it down.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.377
Whoa.

19:34.221 --> 19:36.628
Colonel.

19:41.059 --> 19:43.135
A serpent guard.

19:44.019 --> 19:45.561
Yeah.

19:48.539 --> 19:50.898
I guess he didn't make it.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.976
Ya think?

19:54.738 --> 19:58.016
OK. This is P4A-771. This is Earth.

19:58.017 --> 20:01.894
Now, the Stargate shut itself down
just after Teal'c and I came through.

20:01.895 --> 20:04.815
There was an energy surge.

20:04.816 --> 20:08.375
Right, but what would that have done
to the wormhole itself?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.854
- I have no idea.
- Could it just disappear?

20:10.855 --> 20:13.933
I don't think so, sir.
It would have to discharge somewhere.

20:13.934 --> 20:16.813
Like another Stargate?

20:16.814 --> 20:21.173
Yeah, maybe. Sir, it's all theoretical,

20:21.173 --> 20:24.570
but we think that Stargates
are basically giant superconductors.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.490
Charged matter streams
along lines of force between them.

20:27.491 --> 20:29.730
Positive to negative, like electricity?

20:29.730 --> 20:34.449
Except for the fact that it happens outside
our dimension - yeah, more or less.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.941
OK, what if it jumped?

20:38.211 --> 20:41.449
Redirected itself here or here?

20:41.450 --> 20:44.688
Or anywhere along here?

20:44.688 --> 20:47.326
You're suggesting
we search all these worlds?

20:47.326 --> 20:49.846
We've narrowed
an entire galaxy of Stargates

20:49.847 --> 20:51.839
down to a handful of possibilities.

20:51.846 --> 20:56.566
If you're right, why haven't they used
that Stargate to come back on their own?

20:56.566 --> 21:00.443
Teal'c and I were flung out so fast,
I don't even remember hitting the ramp.

21:00.444 --> 21:05.242
They could be hurt, in which case we will
not have to search far from the Stargates.

21:05.243 --> 21:07.451
I think we owe it to them to try.

21:14.762 --> 21:17.080
You ID'd the seventh symbol yet?

21:17.082 --> 21:18.279
Yeah.

21:18.922 --> 21:23.250
This one has to be the point of origin.
I've never seen it before.

21:26.079 --> 21:28.570
Oh, no. The batteries...

21:29.799 --> 21:34.343
- I guess it's now or never.
- I've always preferred now... to never.

21:40.917 --> 21:43.076
Here goes.

22:14.151 --> 22:16.227
Damnit! Damn!

22:20.869 --> 22:23.749
Did you dial the right address?

22:23.750 --> 22:25.788
Yes.

22:26.828 --> 22:29.948
It has to be something
as simple as the control interface.

22:29.949 --> 22:33.987
If we can just dig down
to the panel on the DHD, I can fix it.

22:33.987 --> 22:36.442
- Negative.
- Sir, we gotta keep trying.

22:37.227 --> 22:39.704
Of course we do.

22:39.705 --> 22:41.781
But we've been awake...

22:43.586 --> 22:45.662
for a very long time.

22:47.744 --> 22:50.104
It'll be there in the morning.

22:50.105 --> 22:52.343
God!

22:52.344 --> 22:54.942
What about you?

22:54.943 --> 22:57.434
I told you we're gonna get outta here.

22:58.343 --> 23:01.461
It's just gonna take
longer than we thought.

23:02.663 --> 23:04.739
Yes, sir.

23:06.221 --> 23:07.252
Captain?

23:10.101 --> 23:12.176
Yes, sir.

23:26.777 --> 23:28.853
<i>Dr Jackson?</i>

23:30.737 --> 23:34.096
We just received probe telemetry
from P5C-11 and -12.

23:34.096 --> 23:38.134
Neither of them have a breathable
atmosphere any more, if they ever did.

23:38.134 --> 23:43.973
I have formally reported Colonel O'Neill
and Captain Carter as missing in action.

23:43.974 --> 23:45.255
Why?

23:45.294 --> 23:48.710
Missing in action doesn't mean
we stop looking, son.

23:52.413 --> 23:54.489
Missing.

23:55.052 --> 23:57.128
I'm missing something.

24:16.887 --> 24:18.963
Captain?

24:22.646 --> 24:28.566
As... much as I might...
otherwise think this is nice...

24:28.766 --> 24:31.601
Sh. Try to sleep.

24:32.405 --> 24:34.481
Is that what we're doing?

24:35.443 --> 24:38.603
You were exhausted. You passed out.

24:38.604 --> 24:42.962
I thought we had to combine body heat
or we wouldn't make it through the night.

24:42.963 --> 24:48.124
It's fine. It's just... very hard to sleep...

24:49.802 --> 24:52.969
with broken ribs
when someone's lying on you.

24:53.681 --> 24:55.555
Sorry.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.637
Sorry, sorry.

25:01.679 --> 25:03.755
That's better.

25:05.039 --> 25:08.205
We'll sleep for a few hours,
then I'll fix the DHD.

25:09.157 --> 25:11.648
OK. Night.

25:12.798 --> 25:14.874
Night.

25:20.037 --> 25:22.113
Oh... Colonel...

25:23.434 --> 25:25.891
It's my side arm, I swear.

25:29.595 --> 25:31.671
No giggling, please.

25:37.192 --> 25:39.269
<i>If we don't make it...</i>

25:40.232 --> 25:42.790
I won't have any regrets.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.867
You?

25:46.351 --> 25:50.300
<i>I'll regret... dying.</i>

26:40.619 --> 26:43.111
God! Why won't you work?!

26:45.060 --> 26:47.469
Carter. Carter.

26:49.019 --> 26:51.095
Colonel?

26:54.298 --> 26:56.375
Ow!

27:03.096 --> 27:05.173
Sir.

27:05.976 --> 27:08.535
I'm usually the first one up.

27:08.536 --> 27:12.535
You're bleeding internally.
I don't know how badly.

27:12.535 --> 27:16.173
Your broken leg may already
be frostbitten. I can't tell.

27:16.174 --> 27:21.299
I've been trying to warm it up with the last
of our cooking Sterno but it's about had it.

27:22.973 --> 27:25.049
<i>What's the bad news?</i>

27:27.332 --> 27:29.730
- Help me up.
- No, sir.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.354
You need to heal. That's an order.

27:33.010 --> 27:37.009
- I give the orders around here.
- Not doctor's orders.

27:42.410 --> 27:45.326
I want you to drink
as much of this as you can.

27:47.689 --> 27:51.271
Once that Sterno dies,
we won't be able to thaw any more.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.923
I should have gotten you
outta here by now. I'm sorry.

28:02.964 --> 28:05.040
You will. You will.

28:09.763 --> 28:14.962
I have been working on the control panel
for the last 12 hours.

28:14.962 --> 28:18.281
It just... I don't know why it won't work.

28:18.282 --> 28:20.358
It should work.

28:20.962 --> 28:23.203
I am missing something.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.916
- Captain?
- Sir?

28:30.039 --> 28:32.958
It's time to go to plan B.

28:34.039 --> 28:36.638
What would plan B be?

28:36.640 --> 28:38.715
You...

28:39.078 --> 28:43.871
You take the rest of the supplies
and climb out of here.

28:45.396 --> 28:47.769
Take your chances up on the planet.

28:49.915 --> 28:52.634
Head towards daylight.

28:52.635 --> 28:57.594
If I can't get that Stargate to work,
we will both go.

28:59.195 --> 29:01.354
Right.

29:01.355 --> 29:03.347
I'll race you.

29:03.354 --> 29:06.722
All right, Captain. Make it work.

29:07.952 --> 29:10.028
Yes, sir.

29:26.349 --> 29:29.667
Major Castleman
requires medical attention.

29:29.669 --> 29:32.586
Medical team to the embarkation room.

29:32.587 --> 29:34.663
Put the iris on save.

29:37.587 --> 29:39.047
What happened?

29:39.067 --> 29:41.986
We were exploring a cave
not far from the Stargate.

29:41.987 --> 29:44.607
He fell several metres from a rock ledge.

29:45.547 --> 29:48.145
No sign of Captain Carter
or Colonel O'Neill.

29:48.146 --> 29:51.349
- Are you all right?
- I am ready to embark again.

29:54.025 --> 29:56.502
- I'm calling the search off.
- What?

29:56.503 --> 29:59.663
This is the last of the planets
that fit your theory, Doctor.

29:59.663 --> 30:03.623
It's been, what, a few days? What if
we stopped just short of finding them?

30:03.623 --> 30:05.699
I'm sorry.

30:11.820 --> 30:13.896
OK.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.663
The energy converters are intact.

30:19.338 --> 30:23.178
Oh God, reset! Reset! Why didn't I think?

30:23.179 --> 30:25.337
Colonel!

30:25.339 --> 30:29.777
I'm gonna interrupt the power. I'm gonna
shut it all off and turn it on again.

30:29.777 --> 30:34.688
OK. This had better work.
This had better work.

30:55.334 --> 30:57.410
OK.

31:39.125 --> 31:41.201
Work.

31:41.763 --> 31:43.757
Oh, work!

31:45.483 --> 31:47.642
Daniel Jackson.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.083
Teal'c.

31:50.084 --> 31:52.160
Did you see that?

31:58.402 --> 32:00.641
Why are you here?

32:00.642 --> 32:05.480
I couldn't sleep. I was thinking I must be
missing something, and I just realised -

32:05.480 --> 32:07.935
we ruled out a world we shouldn't have.

32:15.679 --> 32:18.170
I guess it didn't work.

32:19.717 --> 32:22.173
I'm sorry.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.752
Not your fault.

32:27.875 --> 32:30.366
I don't understand why it won't work.

32:33.355 --> 32:35.431
Captain.

32:36.394 --> 32:38.470
Plan B.

32:39.192 --> 32:41.269
Go.

32:41.633 --> 32:43.257
No, sir.

32:43.272 --> 32:45.265
Sam...

32:46.711 --> 32:48.788
I'm dying.

32:50.311 --> 32:52.387
Follow my order...

32:53.551 --> 32:54.583
please.

32:56.509 --> 32:58.134
Sir...

32:59.229 --> 33:00.688
Please.

33:03.868 --> 33:05.944
Yes, sir.

33:45.261 --> 33:47.980
How many Earth-based cultures
have we encountered

33:47.980 --> 33:51.538
from periods both before and after
we think the Stargate was buried?

33:51.539 --> 33:54.259
- Several.
- And we've only scratched the surface.

33:54.260 --> 33:57.858
We've tried to account for
these discrepancies with theories of...

33:57.858 --> 33:59.934
What's your point, Doctor?

34:02.897 --> 34:07.935
What if there's a second Stargate here?
What if this energy surge

34:07.935 --> 34:12.811
caused the wormhole to jump
from one Stargate to another... here?

34:13.534 --> 34:15.242
- On Earth?
- Yes.

34:16.856 --> 34:20.094
Would the Goa'uld have put
more than one Stargate on a planet?

34:20.094 --> 34:23.380
If the first became lost to them,
it is possible.

34:23.934 --> 34:26.492
The one Ra put here
might not have been the first.

34:26.494 --> 34:28.972
The Goa'uld didn't build
the Stargate system.

34:28.974 --> 34:30.302
Then where is it?

34:39.251 --> 34:44.079
Colonel, I can't see the surface yet.
It looks like it just keeps going up.

34:45.489 --> 34:46.686
Sam...

34:47.409 --> 34:49.485
Yes, sir?

34:50.889 --> 34:54.507
<i>It was an honour... serving with you.</i>

35:00.206 --> 35:02.282
Yes, sir.

35:08.364 --> 35:11.364
It has to be in a remote location
or it'd have been discovered.

35:11.365 --> 35:15.483
It could have even been buried, or the
Goa'uld would have continued to use it.

35:15.485 --> 35:17.882
Let us hope it is not still buried.

35:17.884 --> 35:21.682
We're looking for radio transmissions
on SG-1's emergency frequency.

35:21.682 --> 35:24.481
Coordinate with our listening posts
around the globe.

35:24.483 --> 35:26.559
General.

35:27.123 --> 35:30.840
When we first opened our Stargate,
it used to shake - a lot.

35:30.842 --> 35:33.400
The ground, the whole facility, everything.

35:33.400 --> 35:37.599
We've installed frequency dampeners
that limit that to a slight vibration.

35:37.599 --> 35:40.998
OK, but what if the second gate
doesn't have those?

35:40.998 --> 35:44.637
Would it shake enough to indicate
its location on a seismometer?

35:44.637 --> 35:48.996
Damn right it would. Run a search for
all recent seismic activity worldwide.

35:48.998 --> 35:52.596
See if any coincide with the time
of our Stargate malfunction.

35:52.597 --> 35:54.876
And check around 4am local time.
I was here.

35:54.876 --> 35:57.476
I thought someone
was trying an offworld activation.

35:57.476 --> 36:01.074
The chevrons glowed
and there was a slight vibration.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.434
Captain Carter and Colonel O'Neill.

36:03.436 --> 36:07.994
What happens when you dial your own
phone number? Wrong person to ask.

36:07.994 --> 36:10.034
- You get a busy signal.
- Exactly.

36:10.034 --> 36:13.873
What else could cause such a vibration
unless they were trying to dial home?

36:13.873 --> 36:17.471
They couldn't get through. Even if
their seventh symbol looked different,

36:17.472 --> 36:20.806
the coordinates of the two gates
would still be exactly the same.

36:25.871 --> 36:29.204
Colonel... I'm almost there.

36:30.150 --> 36:34.563
I'm gonna try to bring back help, sir.
I want you to hold that thought.

37:12.460 --> 37:15.981
We got it! Antarctica. The timing
of the event is to the second,

37:15.981 --> 37:18.581
including the event that
Dr. Jackson experienced.

37:18.581 --> 37:22.980
- Latitude and longitude?
- Yes, sir. It's 15 miles out of McMurdo.

37:22.980 --> 37:24.059
- Permission...
- Granted!

37:24.099 --> 37:28.393
Order McMurdo Station to begin
a search of those coordinates now!

37:40.056 --> 37:42.132
Colonel.

37:49.014 --> 37:51.614
It's an ice planet.

37:51.614 --> 37:54.485
That's all there is,
as far as the eye can see.

37:58.853 --> 38:00.929
No chance.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.407
Colonel!

38:21.409 --> 38:23.485
I'm coming down.

38:53.603 --> 38:55.679
Colonel.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.036
Colonel.

39:13.958 --> 39:16.034
Sara.

39:25.157 --> 39:27.233
I'm here, Jack.

39:29.675 --> 39:33.474
<i>Cold. So cold.</i>

39:33.476 --> 39:35.552
I know.

39:37.474 --> 39:39.550
It's all right.

39:40.954 --> 39:43.030
You can sleep now.

39:55.630 --> 39:58.751
It was an honour serving
with you too, Colonel.

40:18.186 --> 40:22.137
<i>McMurdo, this is rescue team Charlie.
We've found 'em. Over.</i>

40:24.947 --> 40:28.144
<i>Sam. Sam!</i>

40:28.144 --> 40:32.063
Come on. She's gonna be OK.
You're gonna be OK.

40:32.065 --> 40:35.730
- As is Colonel O'Neill.
- Let's get them in the chopper.

40:37.943 --> 40:40.621
The colonel, he's bleeding internally.

40:40.623 --> 40:43.900
We know, Captain. Don't worry.
He's going to be all right.

40:43.902 --> 40:47.817
General, you came
through the Stargate for us.

40:48.461 --> 40:51.034
Not exactly, Captain.

40:51.541 --> 40:55.699
A team from the SGC will be arriving
within the hour to secure this area.

40:55.699 --> 40:58.653
In the meantime,
let's get these people home.
