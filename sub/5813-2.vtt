00:02.920 --> 00:06.424
Getting rid of the Mark unleashed a force
on this world that could destroy it.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.561
This is The Darkness, right?
It's got to be.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.876
So, what, she shows up
and everybody goes 28 Days Later?

00:11.929 --> 00:13.852
They were like rabid dogs,
they didn't stop

00:14.431 --> 00:15.551
Maybe it was the smoke.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.564
Anybody who was outside,
they were exposed.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.608
- That wasn't human.
- Why not? I killed Death.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.571
I'm pretty much open for anything.

00:22.606 --> 00:23.846
- They bleed on you?
- They did.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.742
- It might be transmittable.
- I'll go.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.198
And you save my baby girl.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.658
Her name is Amara.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.290
Look, we can just wait for them to die.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.533
We can't save Cass
if we're stuck in some hospital.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.123
I can't help myself.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.630
He's still alive.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.798
Brothers. Save me from doing worse.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.633
All right, let's gear up.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.349
Saving people means all of the people.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.227
- What are you thinking?
- Get Jenna and the baby somewhere safe.

00:52.636 --> 00:53.853
Without a shot?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.139
Hey!

01:00.310 --> 01:01.311
Hey, you good?

01:01.562 --> 01:02.984
Yeah, I'm gonna run Jenna up
to her grandmother's.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.147
What about you? You okay?

01:04.313 --> 01:06.834
- Like it or not, I'm gonna find a cure.
- Yeah, I know you are.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.774
H-A-T-E.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.145
It was with this left hand that
old brother Cain struck the blow

02:25.395 --> 02:27.022
that laid his brother low.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.736
L-O-V-E.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.919
You see these fingers? They're arched.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.072
These fingers have veins that run straight
to the soul of man.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.536
The right hand, friends, the hand of love.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.580
Now watch
and I'll show you the story of life.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.834
These fingers, dear hearts, is always
a-warrin' and a-tuggin ',

02:43.038 --> 02:44.915
one against the other.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.212
Now watch 'em.

02:47.209 --> 02:50.509
Old brother left hand,
left hand hates a-fightin'.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.631
- Can you talk?
- And it looks like love's a goner.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.638
- Or are you too far gone?
- But wait a minute.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.555
- What?
- Wait a minute.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.429
Hot dog! Love's a-winnin'.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.855
Yes, siree. It's love that's won.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.859
And old left-hand hate is
down for the count.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.356
Good answer.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.969
- Nice neighborhood.
- Yeah, I pretty much grew up here.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.597
Learned to ride my bike down the road.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.228
Had my first kiss
in that blue house over there.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.848
Lost my virginity up there.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.855
- I'll bet blue house was pissed.
- She was.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.773
- Do you mind?
- Yeah.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.657
Hey, beautiful.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.037
Anyway, that's why
I asked you to bring us here.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.661
After everything that happened,
it just feels safe.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.952
Well, good. Safe is good.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.845
- You're so great with her.
- Well, what can I say? Chicks dig me.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.801
- Well, look, I should...
- Right. Sure.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.048
You're gonna be okay. Both of you.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.353
I know. What about you? And Sam?
Are you gonna be okay?

04:21.970 --> 04:23.893
Well, for us the bar's pretty low.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.350
See ya.

04:29.102 --> 04:33.027
Dean? Thank you. For everything.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.873
- Jenna.
- Hi, Grandma.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.960
After you called,
they did a big report on the news.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.379
That weatherman I don't like,
with the big teeth,

04:55.754 --> 04:58.257
he said some kind of freak storm
hit Superior.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.144
Yeah, it was crazy.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.386
Well, don't you worry.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.810
If that thing rolls our way,
I've got a generator,

05:06.097 --> 05:08.691
and enough canned green beans
to last 'til Judgment Day.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.851
Good to know.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.113
And this must be Amara.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.574
Oh.  What a little angel.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.865
Yep. She's a miracle.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.866
And her folks?

05:28.745 --> 05:29.871
It's a long story.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.002
Well, then it can wait till
after your nap.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.585
- My what?
- When's the last time you slept?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.258
Because, and I mean this
in the nicest possible way,

05:37.462 --> 05:39.089
you look like poop on parade.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.929
Now, I made up the guest bedroom,

05:41.174 --> 05:43.142
and I got your father's old crib out
for the baby.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.853
So, I will put her down.

05:45.262 --> 05:50.109
Yes, I will. While you go upstairs
and have a rest, all right?

05:50.642 --> 05:53.111
Honestly, a nap sounds awesome right now.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.614
Well, then,
you just go right upstairs, missy.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.153
Thank you.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.578
Who's the little angel?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.865
No, you have to go to sleep.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.497
Who's a beautiful angel? You are.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.503
Beautiful. Here we go.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.374
Here we go.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.421
Night, night, doodlebug.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.285
What's your name?

07:29.824 --> 07:31.041
Bite me.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.464
Okay, Bite Me.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.834
How long have you been infected?

07:40.335 --> 07:41.757
Could ask you the same thing.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.430
We smell our own.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.099
- Answer the question.
- Why?

07:49.094 --> 07:50.774
You wanna know how much time you got left?

07:52.806 --> 07:53.898
I wanna know everything.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.313
Mmm-hmm.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.187
What's in it for me?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.692
- Well, if I can find a cure...
- "If."

08:07.237 --> 08:08.739
I want something real.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.123
Something I can hold in my hands.

08:14.786 --> 08:15.787
Like what?

08:20.709 --> 08:21.710
Your pudding.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.780
I was infected last night. You?

08:44.691 --> 08:45.692
This morning.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.947
- Wait, a second, then why...
- Am I further along?

08:50.447 --> 08:51.448
Don't know.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.785
This thing, it ain't math.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.794
I seen some people change fast,
some change slow.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.793
But in the end,

09:03.960 --> 09:05.507
we all end up the same.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.798
We 90 psycho.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.135
Then we go boom.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.097
Well, that's not...

09:19.684 --> 09:20.901
I'm gonna fix this.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.192
Liar!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.325
You and me,

09:28.068 --> 09:29.285
we're dead.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.495
We're just taking our sweet time about it.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.504
So, if you were smart,

09:41.206 --> 09:42.674
you'd put a bullet in me.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.970
Then eat one yourself.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.482
Come on, Cass.

10:07.982 --> 10:08.983
Hmm.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.245
- Dean.
- As in Winchester?

10:13.863 --> 10:17.037
Probably. Do the honors.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.126
Good morning, handsome.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.971
Efram? Jonah?

10:31.381 --> 10:32.849
What's happening?

10:33.091 --> 10:35.219
We have questions for you, Castiel.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.270
Why am I...

10:38.930 --> 10:41.558
- I asked for help.
- And I asked for a vessel

10:41.724 --> 10:45.069
that didn't have psoriasis. Crap happens.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.316
- No.
- No what?

10:50.692 --> 10:55.573
No, you don't understand.
I'm cursed.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.866
You should run.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.695
Did you hear that? Sounded like raccoons.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.690
That was not a raccoon.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.068
Jenna, don't!

12:08.645 --> 12:10.522
Jenna, No!

12:11.105 --> 12:13.358
- The Devil's in that girl.
- What?

12:13.858 --> 12:15.860
- I'm calling Father Wyatt.
- Grandma, no.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.946
Well, who are we gonna call?

12:18.529 --> 12:19.530
Ghostbusters.

12:21.032 --> 12:24.502
Jenna, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. What's wrong?

12:37.632 --> 12:40.351
I mean, it sounds like
something out of The Exorcist.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.170
- That's what I said.
- So, you're thinking demon?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.561
Or the kid got infected by something,
you know.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.021
Who knows what was in that
giant, crazy fart.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.395
Wow.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.568
Vivid. Thanks.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.586
- Look, man, I know you're flying solo...
- No, I'm fine, Dean.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.698
Look, don't worry about me and just...

12:59.070 --> 13:01.664
Just help Jenna.
And if you need anything then call me.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.202
Will do. How you doing? How's Zombieland?

13:08.037 --> 13:11.132
It's good. It's great.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.260
Where's Metatron?

13:22.176 --> 13:23.348
I don't know.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.857
- Where's Metatron, Castiel?
- Mercy, brother, please.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.564
"Brother"?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.911
What are you?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.533
I'm an angel of the Lord.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.622
That so?

13:47.368 --> 13:51.919
'Cause near as I can tell,
when you have to choose between Heaven

13:52.498 --> 13:54.921
- and the Winchesters...
- You choose them.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.803
Every time.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.556
So, see, you're not my brother.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.263
And if I had it my way,

14:04.260 --> 14:05.477
I'd take this blade,

14:06.304 --> 14:08.602
stick it in your heart...

14:08.848 --> 14:12.819
...and call that a damn good day.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.777
Then do it.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.789
Fun's just getting started.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.016
Hey, Sam.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.019
How do you know my name?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.361
- Who are you?
- Mmm.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.863
Think you mean "what."

15:45.987 --> 15:50.117
Here's a hint, you and your brother,
been real good for business lately.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.289
- You're a reaper.
- Circle gets the square.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.416
What's your name?

16:00.251 --> 16:01.878
You flirting with me, kid?

16:02.378 --> 16:05.302
Because, no offense,
but you ain't my type.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.556
And I'm not looking to get friendly
with the man who helped gut my boss.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.265
I'm sorry about Death.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.733
So am I.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.607
But people are still dying, so...

16:20.605 --> 16:22.903
Work to do. Souls to collect.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.655
Messages to deliver.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.492
What kind of messages?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.287
It's over.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.411
What's over?

16:36.412 --> 16:37.709
You and Dean.

16:38.289 --> 16:42.135
Dying and coming back, again and again.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.849
The old Death thought it was funny,
but now,

16:48.549 --> 16:51.098
there's one hard, fast rule
in this universe.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.938
What lives, dies.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.902
So, the next time
you or your brother bite it, well,

17:00.895 --> 17:02.317
you're not going to Heaven.

17:02.897 --> 17:03.898
Or Hell.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.868
One of us, and, Lord, I hope it's me,

17:08.903 --> 17:11.781
we're gonna make a mistake,
and toss you out into the Empty.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.454
And nothing comes back from that.

17:27.128 --> 17:28.631
I know you're dying.

17:30.967 --> 17:31.968
I can feel it.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.436
You're unclean, in the biblical sense.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.233
So, I'll be seeing you again, Sam.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.866
Seeing you real soon.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.825
Name's Billie, by the way.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.503
Again, Metatron. Where is he?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.501
I don't know.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.632
- But you broke him out of Heaven?
- Yes.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.718
- And took his grace?
- Yes.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.759
And you expect us to believe he, what,
just gave you the slip?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.015
No powers? No wings?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.097
Metatron tricked me.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.599
- So, you're just stupid.
- Or he's lying.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.693
- Or that.
- One way to find out.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.153
What should we cut off first?

18:32.194 --> 18:35.368
Eenie, meenie,

18:37.074 --> 18:38.075
miney,

18:41.912 --> 18:42.913
or mo?

18:54.258 --> 18:55.760
That's enough!

18:58.054 --> 18:59.055
Hannah?

19:00.765 --> 19:03.439
- What are you doing?
- Getting answers.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.235
No. This isn't how we do things.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.775
Get out.

19:14.862 --> 19:15.863
Out!

19:26.374 --> 19:27.717
Thank you.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.926
Don't thank me yet.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.973
Something's happened, Castiel.
Something horrible.

20:21.887 --> 20:22.888
So,

20:24.890 --> 20:26.437
I know it's been a long time,

20:31.689 --> 20:34.158
but Dean and I,
we've been through a lot of bad.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.494
But this is different.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.915
This is my fault
and I don't know how to fix it.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.497
And if I have to die,
I've made my peace with that, but,

20:50.332 --> 20:53.552
please, Dean deserves better.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.888
Dean deserves a life.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.774
There are people out there, good people,

21:08.267 --> 21:12.113
who are going to suffer because of me.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.528
And I am not asking you
to clean up my mess.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.281
Hell, I don't even know
if you're out there,

21:20.362 --> 21:22.535
but if you are,

21:23.491 --> 21:24.993
and if you can hear me,

21:25.785 --> 21:26.786
I, um...

21:28.496 --> 21:30.498
We need your help, God.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.877
We need to know there's hope.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.505
We need a sign.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.089
What does that mean?

22:20.756 --> 22:21.803
Hey.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.093
Where's the kid?

22:24.510 --> 22:25.932
We got another problem.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.392
Figures.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.772
I tried to stop her,

22:28.973 --> 22:31.726
but my grandma's real Catholic,
and after the crazy,

22:31.892 --> 22:35.112
she called her priest
who sent over an exorcist.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.156
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.331
Hello, my son.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.056
- Crowley?
- Father Crowley.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.809
- Do you know each other?
- Oh, yes.

23:10.431 --> 23:13.150
Dean was a rather
scrumptious young altar boy.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.608
Can I talk to you outside? Father.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.155
Of course. After I finish my tea.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.753
No.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.468
This is safer.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.777
I wasn't lying about Metatron.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.063
I know.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.987
But right now I'm more worried about you.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.031
Can you heal me?

24:13.035 --> 24:14.207
I can't.

24:15.079 --> 24:18.128
I'm sorry. This... It's powerful magic.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.967
Really? Father Crowley? Really?

24:24.380 --> 24:26.849
I'm sorry,
Agent Pathetic-Has-Been-Rockstar,

24:27.174 --> 24:29.677
did I offend your delicate sensibilities?

24:29.927 --> 24:31.179
Where have you been?

24:32.054 --> 24:34.728
Your brother, and that idiot angel,
do you know what they have been doing?

24:34.974 --> 24:36.351
- I've heard.
- Everything?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.273
Enough. What are you doing here?

24:38.936 --> 24:40.984
Same as you. I'm working a case.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.488
I feel the spell
just cutting deeper and deeper.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.866
And I'm trying to fight it.
I'm trying, but...

24:48.070 --> 24:51.040
Does it have anything to do with
the disturbance in Superior, Nebraska?

24:55.077 --> 24:56.294
You know about that?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.755
Alarms have been sounding
in Heaven, Castiel.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.839
Alarms that haven't gone off in ever.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.421
We don't even know what they mean.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.723
Those alarms are for The Darkness.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.849
The Darkness is a story.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.778
No, it's not. It's real.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.609
The Darkness,

25:27.568 --> 25:30.117
it's been locked away
since the dawn of creation.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.915
And now it's free.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.294
Hey. Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.042
God help us.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.090
I wouldn't count on that.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.304
It's okay.

25:50.632 --> 25:53.135
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.642
Then who would? The Winchesters?

25:58.432 --> 26:02.903
Castiel, if this is true, it's the end.
For all of us.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.112
Sam and Dean, where are they?

26:08.776 --> 26:10.778
- I don't know.
- Then think harder!

26:13.322 --> 26:14.494
How did you find me?

26:15.324 --> 26:18.419
I have sources in the Catholic Church.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.335
Nuns that owe me a favor.
Priests with a taste for...

26:22.664 --> 26:24.507
Okay, all right, yeah, I can imagine.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.587
You really can't.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.382
Anyhow, they hear a demonic possession,
they call me.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.180
If it's one of mine,
I tell them to ignore it.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.638
If it's, say, a demon gone rogue,

26:36.845 --> 26:39.689
well, that's when Father Crowley
comes out to play.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.693
So, you think there's a demon in there?

26:43.393 --> 26:44.736
Not even a little bit.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.716
- I saved you.
- No.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.672
I don't think you did.

27:09.294 --> 27:14.221
I think that you told Efram and Jonah
to bring me here,

27:14.591 --> 27:17.265
and to hurt me and so you arranged to...

27:19.763 --> 27:22.767
To burst in and save me.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.394
You were hoping that I would be
so grateful,

27:25.561 --> 27:27.905
that I would do anything you said.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.575
That I would tell you anything
that you wanted to know.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.245
Why, Hannah?

27:40.868 --> 27:41.994
We were friends.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.089
That was before you freed Metatron.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.258
Before...

27:51.461 --> 27:53.589
The other angels, they hate you.

27:54.298 --> 27:55.470
And what about you?

27:56.758 --> 27:57.850
Do you hate me?

28:01.263 --> 28:02.685
Doesn't matter.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.273
We took a vote.

28:07.603 --> 28:11.699
Democracy in action
and Hannah's doing the job.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.621
I won't give you Sam and Dean.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.741
Sure you will.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.210
We're gonna hack your brain.

28:30.083 --> 28:34.304
Whatever's in that house,
I can taste the power radiating from it.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.301
Oh, Jenna.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.018
You scared me.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.724
That thing.

28:43.597 --> 28:44.598
It's old.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.400
What'd you do?
Drop a bowling ball up there?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.061
Deep.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.234
Jenna?

28:56.193 --> 28:57.319
Dark.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.408
Honey, are you all right?

29:01.198 --> 29:02.620
I always wanted to try this.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.469
Jenna? Jenna.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.227
Well, hello, plot twist.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.350
Anything?

29:28.141 --> 29:30.735
- Not yet.
- You said you knew how to do this.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.027
I watched Naomi. Once.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.526
Enough.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.310
Look, you don't wanna get
your pretty hands dirty, fine.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.410
Walk away. But this is happening. Gimme.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.003
Now hold still, this one might hurt.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.545
I said stop.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.626
You get in my way again...

29:54.084 --> 29:57.213
You touch me again and I

29:58.922 --> 30:00.174
will

30:01.800 --> 30:03.643
end you!

30:03.885 --> 30:04.977
Uh, Efram...

30:22.237 --> 30:24.581
- Castiel...
- No!

31:00.442 --> 31:01.489
No.

31:06.448 --> 31:07.449
No.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.316
Sam. Sam. Sam.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.947
You're fine. You're fine. You're fine.
You're fine.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.945
You're unclean, in the biblical sense.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.544
Don't!

32:39.166 --> 32:42.045
Don't do this to yourself.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.758
Oh, God.

32:46.548 --> 32:50.018
Wait... Stop! I can't...

32:50.594 --> 32:55.600
Don't do this to yourself. Wait. Stop!

33:18.371 --> 33:20.123
Jen? Jenna?

33:20.749 --> 33:22.296
- Really?
- What?

33:23.043 --> 33:26.422
We have no idea what ancient,
world-shattering evil we're dealing with,

33:26.630 --> 33:28.052
but go right ahead.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.549
Let 'em know we're coming!

33:31.051 --> 33:33.600
Listen, Velma,
this isn't the Scooby Gang, okay?

33:33.929 --> 33:35.897
- So, either shut up, or get out.
- Easy, tiger.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.266
Just trying to help.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.521
I'm way more of a Daphne.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.139
We're bound, Dean.

34:12.509 --> 34:13.976
We'll always be bound.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.437
We will always help each other.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.937
The child likes you.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.942
No surprise, really. You're very maternal.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.156
We gotta find Jenna.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.908
Hey.

35:54.569 --> 35:55.912
Thank you.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.074
Let's go save the rest of them.

36:03.787 --> 36:04.959
Drama.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.052
Jenna? What are you doing?

36:19.678 --> 36:21.476
My grandma collected these things.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.898
But I always thought they were so blah.

36:30.563 --> 36:33.442
Don't worry, she won't care.
I cut her throat.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.695
Why did you do that?

36:37.487 --> 36:39.455
Because this woman doesn't have a soul.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.619
Fascinating.

36:45.161 --> 36:46.629
What are you talking about?
How's that even possible?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.795
Amara's hungry. She's a growing girl.

36:58.591 --> 36:59.638
Jenna.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.477
Listen to me.

37:02.387 --> 37:06.517
Whatever's happened, whatever's going on,
we can fix it, okay?

37:06.975 --> 37:08.352
But I don't wanna be fixed.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.820
I like the new me. She's a ball.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.359
Just come with us. Okay?

37:23.450 --> 37:24.918
Enough! Stop!

37:45.096 --> 37:46.188
I was getting bored.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.858
You killed her.

37:53.605 --> 37:54.652
You're welcome.

37:55.106 --> 37:59.361
- Where are you going?
- To see the child that eats souls.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.372
You don't get what that thing is.

38:03.323 --> 38:04.324
Enlighten me.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.703
Come on, darling. Don't play coy.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.300
I think Amara's The Darkness.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.294
Interesting.

38:18.213 --> 38:21.012
So, what now? You kill her? You?

38:23.343 --> 38:25.220
- I don't have a choice.
- Please.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.367
Even if you could murder a baby,
you couldn't murder that baby.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.003
I saw the way you looked at her.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.358
Me, on the other hand,
it's not like it'd be my first.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.564
- Was that an offer?
- It's a promise.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.068
- Right after I'm done with her.
- Stay away from her.

38:43.613 --> 38:44.910
Oh, Dean.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.912
Adorable little Dean.

38:47.742 --> 38:51.372
I want that child. And I get what I want.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.715
You and Sam don't understand.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.878
I'm not your bloody sidekick.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.267
We've had some good times.

39:05.927 --> 39:09.602
So, I'm gonna give you one chance,
just one,

39:10.265 --> 39:11.357
to walk out that door.

39:11.808 --> 39:15.028
Or I'm gonna take you apart, atom by atom.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.114
Do you understand?

39:21.609 --> 39:22.610
Bastard!

40:12.577 --> 40:14.217
All right, I still don't understand.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.966
I mean, I thought The Darkness
was a woman, not a child.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.508
Same here.

40:20.168 --> 40:24.844
I don't know, maybe whatever I saw
wasn't real, maybe it was a vision.

40:26.466 --> 40:27.513
- Vision?
- Yeah.

40:31.930 --> 40:32.931
Huh.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.102
- Weird.
- Yeah, weird with

40:37.685 --> 40:40.063
a weird cherry on the weird top.
We've got to get a maid.

40:42.523 --> 40:46.528
You know, one with a little uniform,
and really big...

41:06.172 --> 41:07.549
Help me.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.748
My, haven't you grown
into a sweet young thing?

41:39.747 --> 41:41.340
Want some candy, little girl?

42:25.251 --> 42:26.252
English - SDH
