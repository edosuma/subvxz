00:06.400 --> 00:13.170
Good morning, little mutants.

00:13.210 --> 00:18.350
All right. Now, it's time for...
Bad news.

00:18.380 --> 00:23.320
They found out coconut juice
makes your hair fall out?

00:23.360 --> 00:25.160
No.

00:25.190 --> 00:29.660
We're going to do an acting
exercise about giving bad news.

00:29.700 --> 00:33.330
- Why?
- Why.

00:33.370 --> 00:37.970
To teach you that acting often involves
making choices about how to say things.

00:38.010 --> 00:40.040
For example...
How do you give someone bad news.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.950
And make it seem not so bad?

00:43.980 --> 00:47.050
By telling them in a language
they don't understand!

00:47.080 --> 00:48.950
No Cat.

00:48.990 --> 00:53.620
Just come up on stage here.
Robbie, you too, up up.

00:53.660 --> 00:59.290
And now, your partner in this
little acting exercise...

00:59.330 --> 01:02.060
Tanner... come in!

01:02.100 --> 01:06.640
Everybody, this is Tanner, a young
boy who lives next door to me.

01:06.670 --> 01:08.370
- Hi Tanner.
- Hey Tanner.

01:08.410 --> 01:10.010
- 'Sup Tanner?
- Have a seat.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.980
All right, Cat and Robbie...

01:12.010 --> 01:18.320
Here's a card with some random bad
news for you to give to Tanner.

01:18.350 --> 01:19.720
- Got it.
- Oh, okay.

01:19.750 --> 01:20.420
Good!

01:20.450 --> 01:24.560
Now improvise a scene where you
have to give Tanner that bad news.

01:24.590 --> 01:28.160
In a way that doesn't upset him.

01:28.190 --> 01:31.260
- Uhhh...
- Uhhh...

01:31.300 --> 01:33.570
Ooh. That's good!

01:33.600 --> 01:38.070
One sec...

01:38.110 --> 01:42.710

02:12.610 --> 02:15.270

02:15.310 --> 02:18.380
See, the boy's smiling.

02:18.410 --> 02:20.280
Yeah, that was really cool.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.680

02:35.300 --> 02:40.200
At night, your parents' driveway
looks a lot like mine.

Now off ya go.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.410

02:46.810 --> 02:47.710

02:47.740 --> 02:50.010
You really ran over
the boy's go-cart?

02:50.050 --> 02:55.150
Three times.
I thought it was a raccoon.

02:55.190 --> 02:58.750
Take your seats.

02:58.790 --> 02:59.920
Alright.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.590
Now let's talk about the
new play I'm directing.

03:03.630 --> 03:04.960
Do I get to star in it?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.960
Uh, I think it's my turn to star
in one of Sikowitz's plays.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.700
Why are you talking?

03:10.740 --> 03:13.540
There, y'see?
Every time I cast a new play,

03:13.570 --> 03:16.570
you all get your panties in a pretzel.

03:16.610 --> 03:22.310
So this time... ...
You people will choose your own roles.

03:22.350 --> 03:27.880
Andre, pick a role.

03:27.920 --> 03:33.390
- "Tommy: Ten-year-old "identical
twin brother of Carter."

03:33.420 --> 03:37.330
Beck, pick a role.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.600
- "Carter: Ten-year-old "identical
twin brother of Tommy".

03:40.630 --> 03:42.030
I guess we're twins.

03:42.070 --> 03:48.300
Then momma's got some explainin' to do.

03:48.340 --> 03:51.010
Jade, pick a role.

03:51.040 --> 03:57.610

04:01.320 --> 04:06.390

04:06.430 --> 04:08.660
I'm supposed to play her wife?

04:08.690 --> 04:10.160
I'll just pick another card.

04:10.200 --> 04:16.600
No! My box has spoken.

04:16.630 --> 04:17.670
Uh, Sikowitz...

04:17.700 --> 04:26.040

Hey...
Hey, you guys...

05:40.410 --> 05:41.980
Can you do me a big favor?

05:42.010 --> 05:43.410
- What's goin' on?
- What is it?

05:43.450 --> 05:44.880
Okay see, I borrowed Beck's car...

05:44.910 --> 05:46.780
'Cuz I needed to take my grandma
to the doctor...

05:46.820 --> 05:49.250
- Yeah?
- But she got scared and wouldn't go,

05:49.290 --> 05:51.360
so the doctor told me
to bring him a cup of her uh...

05:52.060 --> 05:55.590
Y'know... liquid.

05:55.590 --> 05:57.890
Whaaaa...?

05:57.930 --> 06:01.900
I uhhh...
I think he means her urine.

06:01.930 --> 06:03.700
Yeah.
And when I took a sharp left,

06:03.730 --> 06:09.710
the cup of uh... grandma...
Spilled all over the front seat.

06:09.740 --> 06:12.080
Alright, I've got rubber gloves
and sponges in my locker.

06:12.110 --> 06:15.480

Don't you understand?!

08:51.510 --> 08:53.410
Your father is an astronaut!

08:53.440 --> 08:55.210
It's his dream to walk on the moon,

08:55.240 --> 08:59.680
but now that might never happen
because of his narcolepsy!

08:59.710 --> 09:01.210
What's narcolepsy?

09:01.250 --> 09:04.420
It's when you're always falling
asleep, even when you're not tired.

09:04.450 --> 09:07.150
- Car door sound-effect!

09:07.190 --> 09:09.120

Now, boys, no matter how narcoleptic he is,

09:12.190 --> 09:14.030
you pretend you don't notice.

even tell my own twin sons apart!

It's not your fault!
They're identical!

09:52.270 --> 09:58.370
Look at them.

09:58.410 --> 10:03.710
Oh, Nancy. You're so...

- Blast off!

10:06.720 --> 10:10.780
No, no.
You were saying I'm so...?

You're an astronaut.

10:33.780 --> 10:37.610

- Then get a better haircut.

- Blaaaoooooo...

11:07.840 --> 11:15.380

- Thanks.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.920
Hey... what makes green tea
green?

11:56.960 --> 12:00.190
Ahhh.
Ancient Japanese secret.

12:00.230 --> 12:02.260
Oh, c'mon, you can tell me.

12:02.300 --> 12:11.770
I just did.
That's the brand of green tea we use.

12:11.810 --> 12:15.440
- Bwaaahhh!!!!!
- Ahhhhhhh!!!

12:15.480 --> 12:19.980

12:20.010 --> 12:24.180
Ah, there's Jade. Jade!

12:24.220 --> 12:31.920
- What's this dark little beverage?
- Soy sauce.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.290
Okay, I'm here... why?

12:34.330 --> 12:38.400
Because you two need to learn to
play a husband and wife believably.

12:38.430 --> 12:41.200
What does that have to do with Sushi?!

12:41.230 --> 12:44.900
Listen, I once did a show where I
had to play a man in great pain,

12:44.940 --> 12:49.540
so to prepare, I threw myself
down a flight of stairs.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.710
You wouldn't believe
how many times I hit my head.

12:52.750 --> 12:56.150
- Yeah, we would.
- We really, really would.

12:56.180 --> 13:01.720
Now, to prepare for your
roles, you two must date.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.260
So have fun.

13:03.290 --> 13:04.560
- With what?
- Your date.

13:04.590 --> 13:08.830
- What date?
- This one. It begins now at...

13:08.860 --> 13:11.100
...Seven-oh-twelve P.M.

13:11.130 --> 13:16.630
You two must stay here, eat, drink, chat, and
giggle until the restaurant closes at midnight.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.740
- Forget it... I'm leaving.
- Yeah, me too...

13:18.770 --> 13:22.210
Ah! If either of you leave
before midnight,

13:22.240 --> 13:25.340
you both get an f for the semester.

13:25.380 --> 13:28.350
- Sikowitz...
- It's fine. He's not gonna know when we leave.

13:28.380 --> 13:31.220
Oh, yes, he gonna.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.120
I have two spies watching you.

13:33.150 --> 13:41.360
Sinjin...
...And Burf.

13:41.390 --> 13:49.830
Happy dating.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.840
- Excuse me?
- Hai!

13:51.870 --> 13:53.700
Yeah, my date and I were wondering.

13:53.740 --> 13:56.850
If you have a flight of stairs
we could throw ourselves down?

14:12.520 --> 14:20.160
Nooooooo!

14:20.200 --> 14:21.430
Worst night ever.

14:21.470 --> 14:24.170
Ya think I'm having fun on this "date"?
Because I am not.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.140
- Then let's not talk.
- Fine. Y'know...

14:28.170 --> 14:31.010
Ulllccchhh.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.610
There's no good reason why you and I
shouldn't be able to sit here together.

14:33.650 --> 14:35.080
And have a conversation.

14:35.110 --> 14:36.410
- I got a good reason.
- Which is...?

14:36.450 --> 14:39.280
- I don't like you.
- Really?

14:39.320 --> 14:42.990
You can't think of one thing
that you like about me?

14:43.020 --> 14:47.060
I like when you're sad.

14:47.090 --> 14:49.630
Okay... try again.

14:49.660 --> 14:52.060
Reach deep down
into your twisted, bitter soul.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.870
And see if you can find
anything nice to say about me.

14:55.900 --> 15:04.810
Uh, okay...
Your singing... isn't awful.

15:04.850 --> 15:07.650
Thanks so much.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.420
Now let's hear you say
something nice about me.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.650
Sure. Ummm...

15:11.690 --> 15:15.190
I admire how you're never
afraid to say what you think.

15:15.220 --> 15:16.120
That's stupid.

15:16.160 --> 15:21.860
See? Now your turn again.

15:21.900 --> 15:29.030
Ummm... I guess...
Some people might say that...

15:29.070 --> 15:35.340
From certain angles...
You're pretty.

15:35.380 --> 15:39.750
You could say I'm pretty.

15:39.780 --> 15:55.200
You are pretty.

15:55.870 --> 15:58.070
- Uh-oh!
- Babe sandwich!

15:58.100 --> 16:02.000
Whooooaaaa!

16:02.040 --> 16:05.210
And this night actually gets worse.

16:05.240 --> 16:08.210
Guys, we really wanna hang out alone.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.940
- We are alone.
- Just the four of us.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.780
P'joink!

16:13.810 --> 16:15.980
Oh my God.

16:16.020 --> 16:19.380
So, doctor Chad, how's the patient look?

16:19.420 --> 16:20.820
Whoa!

16:20.860 --> 16:22.790
Looks like she has a Chad infection.

16:22.820 --> 16:25.830
Whoa! Ain't no cure
for a Chad infection.

16:25.860 --> 16:32.030
- Guess she's stuck with me.
- P'joink!

16:32.070 --> 16:42.940
Burf, take notes.
These guys got serious skills.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.880
...From my theatrical
makeup class.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.980
He's taking me to a laker game,
and then to peezios for dinner.

16:48.990 --> 16:52.860
Oh, ooops, my fella's here.

16:52.890 --> 16:58.090
Grandma, I don't have time
to hear about your pain.

16:58.130 --> 17:02.560
- Can we come in?
- Uh, I guess.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.430
Listen, I don't have a lotta time.

17:04.470 --> 17:08.140
