00:34.625 --> 00:35.833
And that wraps up orange county.

00:35.834 --> 00:37.791
And on the West Side,
we have a sigalert

00:37.792 --> 00:39.499
on the 405 northbound
at Wilshire.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.875
Traffic is backed up
all the way to the 10.

00:45.625 --> 00:47.624
Darling.

00:47.625 --> 00:48.791
You awake, honey?

00:48.792 --> 00:50.499
Yes.
I couldn't really sleep.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.124
Well, you're not nervous,
are you?

00:52.125 --> 00:54.332
No, I'm excited.

00:54.333 --> 00:55.708
Today could be our day.

00:55.709 --> 00:56.875
Today is our day.

00:57.917 --> 01:00.124
I love you.
I love you, too.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.624
Hey, where you going?

01:01.625 --> 01:03.207
I just remembered something.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.417
But...

01:25.208 --> 01:26.958
I think it's absolutely adorable

01:26.959 --> 01:29.165
how much energy
you're putting into this room.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.165
Most couples don't even begin
to think about nurseries

01:31.166 --> 01:32.833
until they're three months in
or so.

01:32.834 --> 01:35.874
I just want everything to be
right for our little guy. Or girl.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.749
Guy or girl... whatever.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.499
I just want he or she
to be healthy.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.582
Okay.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.667
Well, I have to get ready
for work.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.542
No peeking till after
the fertility clinic.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.040
You're gonna find out
soon enough.

02:12.041 --> 02:14.040
Don't spoil the surprise.
Okay.

02:14.041 --> 02:15.874
All right, I'm late for work.
I got to go.

02:15.875 --> 02:17.457
405 is jammed.
Take sepulveda.

02:17.458 --> 02:18.749
Thanks. 3:00.
Don't be late.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.709
I will be there.
Don't worry. Okay.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.542
Okay.

02:27.917 --> 02:29.166
All right.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.499
That's great. Right there.
Thanks, man.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.249
I'm sorry.
He's not in the office right now.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.457
Sure, I'll put you through.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.249
Good morning.
Hi. Good morning.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.457
Here's the latest changes
in the Stevenson project.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.249
Thanks.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.040
Hey, isn't today the big day?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.916
Yeah, let's hope third time's
the charm?

02:47.917 --> 02:51.457
Good luck.
Thanks.

02:51.458 --> 02:53.916
There are several items
on the agenda, Ms. Stanhope.

02:53.917 --> 02:55.958
I want to make certain
this investment

02:55.959 --> 02:57.332
matches my financial goals.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.541
I'm especially interested
in how the fund

02:59.542 --> 03:01.124
has performed
over the last 15 years

03:01.125 --> 03:03.833
and who conducts your
independent analysis of it.

03:03.834 --> 03:06.332
I'll take a hard look at the way
the portfolio changed

03:06.333 --> 03:08.457
and the types of market
securities the fund holds.

03:08.458 --> 03:09.833
The performance of this fund,

03:09.834 --> 03:11.249
in comparison
to others of its type,

03:11.250 --> 03:12.666
will make the decision for me.

03:12.667 --> 03:15.083
Let's take a look at these,
and then we'll pick up page 2.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.124
Hey. I was starting
to get nervous.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.082
Punctual Pete... always on time.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.416
Yeah, laugh now.

03:26.417 --> 03:28.332
You won't be laughing
when I'm on diaper duty.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.666
Hi.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.833
Come on in, you two.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.291
Here we go.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.750
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.207
Your test came back negative.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.708
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.

03:53.709 --> 03:54.833
But I don't understand.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.666
You said if anything
could work, this would,

03:56.667 --> 03:57.958
like it was a sure thing.

03:57.959 --> 04:00.666
Well, nothing's 100%
with these procedures.

04:00.667 --> 04:03.207
Occasionally,
it's not successful.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.958
I will have to say, though,
I'm a little surprised.

04:05.959 --> 04:08.332
We can... we can keep trying,
can't we?

04:08.333 --> 04:12.040
The more you try,
you won't increase your odds.

04:12.041 --> 04:15.165
Statistically speaking,
after three attempts,

04:15.166 --> 04:16.958
your success rate drops off.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.499
How much?
Considerably.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.916
S-So we shouldn't try again?

04:23.500 --> 04:25.165
I-I've been doing this
a long time.

04:25.166 --> 04:28.165
I'm trying to explain
the realities of the situation.

04:28.166 --> 04:31.290
So, what's the problem?
Medical science has its limits.

04:31.291 --> 04:35.040
We can't perform miracles.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.666
Look, you two can continue
to spend money,

04:37.667 --> 04:39.541
but at this point,
what I'm suggesting

04:39.542 --> 04:42.792
is that you need to start
considering other options.

04:44.542 --> 04:47.833
Well, obviously, you have
some decisions to make,

04:47.834 --> 04:51.000
so I will leave you two
to discuss it.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.874
Mr. and Mrs. Donnell,
how can I help you today?

06:23.875 --> 06:26.249
Hi. We need to open
a line of credit.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.499
All right.
Well!

06:27.500 --> 06:29.166
Okay.
Well, hello, there.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.833
Um, for what reason
will you be applying today?

06:33.834 --> 06:36.749
Well... this is Sam.

06:36.750 --> 06:39.124
Hello, Sam!
We just adopted.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.999
And we thought it would take
a little longer than it did,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.874
and we would have time to save
up for his arrival, but...

06:45.875 --> 06:47.499
Okay, not a problem.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.999
Not a prob...
Hello, there, handsome.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.374
Yes, you are.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.582
Thank you.
You're welcome.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.207
Um... okay.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.332
These are the forms

06:57.333 --> 06:59.374
that I will need you
to fill out initially.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.457
And, just give me one second.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.541
I will be right back with you.
Thank you so much.

07:03.542 --> 07:04.542
My pleasure.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.791
She loved you.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.041
Okay.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.750
Pete?

07:36.375 --> 07:38.083
Pete?

07:51.417 --> 07:53.291
What you doing?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.374
I'm just...

07:56.375 --> 07:58.792
I'm just packing
this stuff away.

08:01.709 --> 08:04.207
Well, a couple
came in the office today.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.249
They just adopted this,
beautiful, beautiful baby boy.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.708
Yeah?

08:08.709 --> 08:11.499
You know, I know we talked about
adoption back in the beginning,

08:11.500 --> 08:13.749
when we were first having
troubles, but I don't know.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.916
Today was just...

08:15.917 --> 08:19.208
It really seemed
like a possibility.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.040
Yeah, I... I don't know.

08:23.041 --> 08:24.749
It would be a baby.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.833
It just wouldn't be the same.

08:26.834 --> 08:29.082
You mean, you... you couldn't...

08:29.083 --> 08:32.416
You couldn't love a little baby,
just 'cause it wasn't ours?

08:32.417 --> 08:33.957
It's just different, you know?

08:33.958 --> 08:35.916
It would be...

08:35.917 --> 08:37.249
It would be different.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.082
That's all I'm saying.

08:40.917 --> 08:45.666
Well, then, I guess
we're just stuck, aren't we?

08:45.667 --> 08:49.541
You don't want to do
any more fertility treatments

08:49.542 --> 08:51.916
and won't consider adoption,
so I guess we're just stuck.

08:51.917 --> 08:53.416
So, now this is all my fault?
No.

08:53.417 --> 08:55.833
You come home late from work
every night.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.582
It's an effort for me
to get out of bed every morning.

08:58.583 --> 09:01.958
I cry at the drop of a hat
for no reason whatsoever.

09:01.959 --> 09:05.457
I am tired
of seeing you be disappointed.

09:05.458 --> 09:10.958
I'm tired of feeling like,
in some way, I have failed.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.457
I can't do this.

09:12.458 --> 09:15.708
Something
has got to change here,

09:15.709 --> 09:17.709
'cause I can't do this anymore.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.999
Sorry.
Didn't mean to rattle you.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.499
You working late again?

09:41.500 --> 09:43.249
Yeah, it's
the Stevenson project.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.708
I'm concerned
about the reinforcements

09:44.709 --> 09:45.833
in the concrete panels.

09:45.834 --> 09:47.249
I just want
to run the numbers again.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.666
So, how's that lovely wife
of yours?

09:49.667 --> 09:52.249
Good. Good.
She's good.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.374
Now, Pete,
it... it's none of my business,

09:54.375 --> 09:56.999
but this is the fourth night
this week you've been here.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.833
You're practically living here.

09:58.834 --> 10:00.165
And not just that...

10:00.166 --> 10:02.750
I notice you've been a little
hard on your team lately.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.207
Late on your deadlines...

10:06.208 --> 10:07.208
Distracted.

10:07.209 --> 10:10.040
Everything's not fine.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.709
It's, um...

10:13.917 --> 10:15.374
It's this whole baby thing.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.374
Still no luck?
No.

10:17.375 --> 10:20.499
And now Donna
thinks I'm being selfish

10:20.500 --> 10:22.207
because I don't want
to keep trying,

10:22.208 --> 10:25.499
and to be perfectly honest
with you

10:25.500 --> 10:27.499
We just can't afford it anymore.

10:27.500 --> 10:31.750
And now there's
a whole adoption issue.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.040
I don't know.
Maybe she's right.

10:35.041 --> 10:36.457
Maybe we are just stuck.

10:36.458 --> 10:39.541
Well...

10:39.542 --> 10:42.040
Maybe you need
a little time off.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.541
Go and have some fun together.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.541
Take a trip.
Rediscover a little romance.

10:46.542 --> 10:47.666
Yeah, that'd be great,

10:47.667 --> 10:49.582
but, we just can't afford it.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.082
I'll tell you what.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.958
You know that time-share of
mine down in San Marcos? Yeah.

10:53.959 --> 10:55.666
Why don't you take it
for a week?

10:55.667 --> 10:57.708
It's right on the beach.
You don't have to fly.

10:57.709 --> 10:59.916
You can just drive your
brand-new, shiny s.U.V.

10:59.917 --> 11:01.290
Down there.

11:01.291 --> 11:03.332
Do you a world of good.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.082
Well, that's
a real generous offer,

11:06.083 --> 11:09.582
but, um, I'm not sure
that now is the right time.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.666
I want you to take that week.

11:11.667 --> 11:15.249
I want you to get away from
all this noise, phones, traffic.

11:15.250 --> 11:18.666
It'll give you a chance
to get this sorted out.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.249
Come on.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.458
We got ourselves a deal?

11:26.583 --> 11:28.750
Good. Good.

12:07.959 --> 12:10.082
Told you
we should have googled this.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.791
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

12:11.792 --> 12:14.792
Yeah, down this dirt road.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.290
Thought you had a map.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.666
Yeah, I do.

12:24.667 --> 12:27.332
Unfortunately,
this road isn't on it.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.666
Look, that first road we were on
turned into this road,

12:29.667 --> 12:31.749
and it should have taken us back
to the main highway,

12:31.750 --> 12:34.416
but unfortunately,
it brought us here, I think.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.999
That's great.
In other words, we're lost, Pete.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.165
Just because I don't know where
we are doesn't mean we're lost.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.833
That is not comforting.

12:40.834 --> 12:41.916
Look...

12:41.917 --> 12:43.916
Look, I know
this wasn't your idea,

12:43.917 --> 12:46.999
but here we are,
on vacation in Mexico.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.749
So, how does that
change anything Pete?

12:48.750 --> 12:51.082
I-I'm still not pregnant.
You won't consider adoption.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.040
Nothing has changed...
Only the scenery.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.375
Pete, watch out!

13:01.667 --> 13:02.874
You okay?

13:02.875 --> 13:04.124
I think so.
Are you?

13:04.125 --> 13:06.624
Yeah, it's not me
I'm worried about.

13:06.625 --> 13:07.874
It's the car.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.541
That doesn't sound good.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.040
No, it doesn't.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.874
Come on.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.875
Wh...

13:16.041 --> 13:18.250
Okay. I think
it's time to call someone.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.916
No. No service.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.499
Great.
That's just great, Pete.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.249
That's great.
What are we supposed to do now?

13:25.250 --> 13:27.958
Well, I think
we should find a town.

13:27.959 --> 13:29.958
There's got to be some
civilization around here somewhere.

13:29.959 --> 13:31.207
There's a sign right there

13:31.208 --> 13:32.874
that says there's a town ahead,
I believe.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.249
Okay, a town is good.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.916
A town means people, and people
mean someone who can help us.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.791
So come on.
Let's go.

13:37.792 --> 13:40.624
No, you... someone should stay
with the car.

13:40.625 --> 13:41.708
Don't you think?
It's a road.

13:41.709 --> 13:42.916
After all,
someone could come along.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.082
You want to stay here
by yourself?

13:44.083 --> 13:45.124
I will be fine, Pete.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.582
Someone's got to stay
with the car.

13:46.583 --> 13:47.958
All of our stuff is in there.

13:47.959 --> 13:48.999
I don't know about this.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.374
Go, all right?

13:51.375 --> 13:53.708
If someone bad comes along,
I'll hop in the car,

13:53.709 --> 13:56.290
lock the door,
and roll up the windows, okay?

13:56.291 --> 13:57.833
Okay, I'll be back
soon as I can.

13:57.834 --> 14:00.917
Fine.
I'll be fine.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.290
Pete?

14:29.291 --> 14:31.958
That you?

14:31.959 --> 14:35.000
Please tell me that's you.

14:37.709 --> 14:39.082
Give me my hat!

14:39.083 --> 14:40.666
Give me my hat!

14:40.667 --> 14:41.709
Give me my hat!

14:47.208 --> 14:49.791
Hello.

14:49.792 --> 14:52.083
Pepillo, come here.

14:53.834 --> 14:55.124
I think so.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.958
Let's go, Jose.

14:56.959 --> 14:58.291
Hey, kid.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.916
Señor, are you here
for the fiesta?

15:02.917 --> 15:04.624
The what?
The fiesta.

15:04.625 --> 15:05.916
Where exactly is here?

15:05.917 --> 15:07.416
You are in dommatina.

15:07.417 --> 15:08.999
Dommatina?
Sí.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.165
Does dommatina have a mecánica?

15:11.166 --> 15:12.833
Un mecánico?
Sí.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.249
The best in all of méxico.

15:14.250 --> 15:15.290
He is my brother.

15:15.291 --> 15:16.833
Come.
I will show you.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.208
Okay.

15:23.959 --> 15:25.833
You said you would watch him.

15:25.834 --> 15:26.874
Now you're here, and he's gone,

15:26.875 --> 15:28.124
and I'm late to meet the priest.

15:28.125 --> 15:30.165
Watch and see... not follow him
around all dommatina.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.207
If you want me to watch him,
you're gonna have to find him first.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

15:33.959 --> 15:36.499
What do you mean? The conchitas
aren't going to bake themselves.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.060
Look, if you see the boy,
please tell him I'm with father Arturo.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.667
Well, you can tell him yourself.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.249
Can you please
not run away like that?

15:46.250 --> 15:48.582
It scares your brother.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.457
Okay.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.333
Hi.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.165
Pepillo...

15:55.166 --> 15:56.666
Where you been?

15:56.667 --> 15:59.541
You know you can't go running
off without telling me.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.040
Can I help you?

16:01.041 --> 16:02.666
Are you the mechanic?
Sí.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.082
My car is in the ditch
at the bottom of the hill.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.874
I think I might have bent
the drive shaft.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.165
Any chance you can tow it up
here and take a look at it?

16:09.166 --> 16:11.916
Um... i think it's a little
too late for that, señor.

16:11.917 --> 16:13.082
Too late?
What do you mean?

16:13.083 --> 16:15.542
See for yourself.

16:28.417 --> 16:30.750
Whoa!

16:31.917 --> 16:35.416
Hi. They came along
right after you left.

16:35.417 --> 16:38.708
All it cost me was a, straw hat.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.874
Hey, um, how much do I owe you?

16:40.875 --> 16:41.875
What?

16:41.876 --> 16:42.958
¿cuánto?

16:42.959 --> 16:44.374
No, señor, you owe me nothing.

16:44.375 --> 16:46.708
I couldn't leave her
stranded on the road.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.416
It would not be right.

16:48.417 --> 16:51.290
Excuse me.

16:51.291 --> 16:53.125
Well, thanks.
Thank you.

16:59.917 --> 17:02.165
I wanted to talk to Maria.

17:02.166 --> 17:05.000
Let's go ask her, then.

17:11.916 --> 17:14.165
Yep, you were right, señor.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.165
It is a wheel bearing
and spindle.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.624
That's what I was afraid of.

17:17.625 --> 17:18.790
Can you fix it?

17:18.791 --> 17:20.790
First, I must take it out
and inspect it.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.165
Well, when can you do that?
Next week.

17:23.165 --> 17:24.624
Next week?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.582
Can't you do it
a little quicker?

17:26.583 --> 17:29.290
I've got, reservations
in San Marcos.

17:29.291 --> 17:30.958
You don't understand.

17:30.959 --> 17:32.290
It's not that.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.124
I promised father Arturo
I would help him.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.582
If I don't help him
with the máquina,

17:35.583 --> 17:36.999
the children cannot fly.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.499
The children can't fly?

17:39.500 --> 17:41.124
Sí, for the fiesta.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.624
This is why your car
must have to wait.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.124
Look, I'm late enough already.
I'm sorry. Wait. Wait.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.874
What if I help
this, father Arturo

17:47.875 --> 17:50.124
with his máquina...
Whatever it is?

17:50.125 --> 17:51.541
Can you at least
take a look at it?

17:51.542 --> 17:52.874
You know about building things?

17:52.875 --> 17:54.666
I do work
for sunhouse engineering.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.165
We've built some of the biggest
buildings in Los Angeles.

17:57.166 --> 18:00.040
But you're good
with ropes and wires?

18:00.041 --> 18:01.332
I hang my own Christmas lights.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.916
Well, maybe it's okay.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.666
You can help father Arturo,
and I can help you.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.666
Okay, where do I find
this father Arturo?

18:07.667 --> 18:10.290
Well, he's at the church.
Pepillo can take you.

18:10.291 --> 18:12.416
Come back in the afternoon.
By then, we will know, okay?

18:12.417 --> 18:14.207
All right, good.
Thanks, man. Okay.

18:14.208 --> 18:16.917
Come.
We must hurry.

18:18.041 --> 18:19.958
Can he fix it?
I don't know.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.290
He won't even look at it

18:21.291 --> 18:23.499
until I find this priest
and help him out.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.916
Priest?
Help him do what?

18:24.917 --> 18:27.916
I don't know... something about
cables and flying children.

18:27.917 --> 18:30.374
Come on! Father Arturo
will be waiting for us.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.416
Okay, don't go anywhere.
This isn't gonna take long.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.375
And then we're getting
out of here... I swear.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.709
Where we going?

18:39.667 --> 18:41.916
My name is pepillo.
What's your name?

18:41.917 --> 18:43.249
Pete.
Peep?

18:43.250 --> 18:44.916
No, no. Pete.
Pete.

18:44.917 --> 18:49.541
Like, Peter.
Pedro, only short.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.374
Pete.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.457
Pete.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.040
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.999
You know what, señor Pete?
What's that?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.040
In five days, I'm going to fly.

18:58.041 --> 18:59.332
Really?

18:59.333 --> 19:00.916
Hey, shouldn't you be in school?

19:00.917 --> 19:03.500
There's no school
the week before the fiesta.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.750
All we got was presidents' day.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.499
Father Arturo.
Father Arturo.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.290
Good morning, pepillo.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.457
How is your leg today?
Good.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.124
And where is Juan?

19:18.125 --> 19:20.958
Juan's working on my car.
I had a little car trouble.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.879
I'm Pete stanhope.
I'll be his replacement today.

19:24.917 --> 19:26.374
Very well.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.416
Father Arturo,
we must get started.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.165
The festival's only days away.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.916
Okay, but be careful
of your leg today, okay?

19:32.917 --> 19:34.208
Okay.
Bueno.

19:36.875 --> 19:40.082
But why flying children?

19:40.083 --> 19:44.290
Well, many years ago,
in this very Plaza,

19:44.291 --> 19:45.791
a stranger arrived,

19:45.792 --> 19:49.916
and he was very thirsty from his
long journey across the desert.

19:49.917 --> 19:52.165
And somehow, the people
were afraid of him,

19:52.166 --> 19:55.290
and they simply closed
their doors and hid.

19:55.291 --> 19:57.791
And the only one
who showed him any kindness

19:57.792 --> 19:59.165
was a small crippled boy.

19:59.166 --> 20:00.290
A boy like me.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.749
And so, to thank the boy
for his kindness,

20:02.750 --> 20:05.874
the stranger, who was none
other than San Judas tadeo,

20:05.875 --> 20:07.999
transformed the boy
into a white dove,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.624
who flew three times
around the Plaza

20:10.625 --> 20:12.666
before he came to rest
at his feet.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.958
So when San Judas tadeo
transformed the boy back,

20:15.959 --> 20:17.249
the boy could walk.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.708
And over the years,

20:18.709 --> 20:21.624
this has come to be known
as the miracle of dommatina.

20:21.625 --> 20:25.124
Every year, in order
to honor San Judas tadeo,

20:25.125 --> 20:27.124
we select one special boy,

20:27.125 --> 20:29.124
and he is given
the chance to fly.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.791
That special boy
is going to be me.

20:30.792 --> 20:33.375
Sí.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.457
Antonio, how are you, man?

20:37.458 --> 20:38.625
Good, Felipe.
What's up?

20:49.375 --> 20:51.958
It smells like cinnamon.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.249
Are you ready?
Very well.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.290
What do you say?

20:55.291 --> 20:57.541
Conchita, conchitas.

20:57.542 --> 20:59.874
Conchitas, conchitas.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.708
Conchitas, conchitas.

21:01.709 --> 21:04.749
Conchitas, conchitas.

21:04.750 --> 21:05.999
Conchitas.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.165
Hey.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.499
Listen, you take
this flour here,

21:09.500 --> 21:12.249
and then you're gonna blow it...
I want to see.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.165
I want to see
that going down, okay?

21:15.166 --> 21:16.332
That's it.
Very good.

21:16.333 --> 21:17.749
You have to do it harder.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.124
Okay, once again,
once again. Harder.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.245
Okay.
Once again, once again.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.874
Hit it.
Hit it hard.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.207
- Conchitas.
- Conchitas.

21:25.208 --> 21:26.833
Conchitas!

21:26.834 --> 21:28.667
There.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.708
I'sorry.
I don't mean to interrupt.

21:36.709 --> 21:38.916
It's just the kids are adorable.

21:38.917 --> 21:40.541
Well, we're making conchitas.

21:40.542 --> 21:41.749
Do you want to come help us?

21:41.750 --> 21:43.040
What are conchitas?

21:43.041 --> 21:44.041
It's cookies.

21:44.042 --> 21:45.499
Here.
I'll show you some.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.417
You can try one.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.083
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.833
My gosh.
Cinnamon.

21:55.834 --> 21:57.249
That tastes like summer.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.624
Yeah.
Then you can come help us.

21:59.625 --> 22:01.082
Well, I would love to.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.332
It's just
that our car broke down,

22:02.333 --> 22:04.458
and soon as we get it fixed,
we're gonna be leaving.

22:10.458 --> 22:12.499
Well, if you're here tomorrow,

22:12.500 --> 22:14.749
you can come help us then, okay?

22:14.750 --> 22:15.916
Okay, thanks.
Okay.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.165
I'm sure by tomorrow
we'll be gone.

22:17.166 --> 22:18.374
You know what?

22:18.375 --> 22:19.582
Things in dommatina

22:19.583 --> 22:21.916
don't necessarily happen
the way you plan them,

22:21.917 --> 22:24.457
so, I mean, we'll be here, okay?

22:24.458 --> 22:26.082
Okay.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.040
Bye.

22:28.041 --> 22:29.625
Adiós.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.791
What did you do?
What is this?

22:33.792 --> 22:35.040
Aah!

22:35.041 --> 22:36.791
We're not gonna have enough
for the conchitas.

22:36.792 --> 22:37.792
What are we doing?

22:37.793 --> 22:39.207
Shake it.
Shake it.

22:39.208 --> 22:40.791
Shake it.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.791
Pepillo!

22:42.792 --> 22:45.457
The sun is hot.
Rest.

22:45.458 --> 22:46.958
First I finish this.

22:46.959 --> 22:50.124
This boy.

22:50.125 --> 22:52.708
He's excited about flying?

22:52.709 --> 22:55.249
Well, it is a great honor
to be chosen,

22:55.250 --> 22:56.958
even more so for pepillo.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.582
He's a special child.

22:59.583 --> 23:01.499
His leg... has it...

23:01.500 --> 23:03.124
Has it always been like that?

23:03.125 --> 23:04.374
Well, no.

23:04.375 --> 23:07.124
His mother and father
passed away some time ago.

23:07.125 --> 23:09.708
He lives now
with his brother Juan,

23:09.709 --> 23:11.624
but there was a tragedy.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.249
There was a fire.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.165
Juan managed to get out in time,

23:15.166 --> 23:18.082
but, he had
to jump out the window

23:18.083 --> 23:20.999
and landed very hard
and injured his spine.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.624
And since then, he has been...
How do you call?

23:23.625 --> 23:25.999
A physical challenge.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.332
Couldn't they have done
a surgery or something?

23:29.333 --> 23:31.082
The doctors did what they could,

23:31.083 --> 23:33.624
but while he's not likely
to get better,

23:33.625 --> 23:36.833
he will probably not be
any worse.

23:36.834 --> 23:39.541
Still, there's much
to be happy about.

23:39.542 --> 23:42.207
He's...
He's a happy child.

23:42.208 --> 23:44.666
He's well-loved by everyone.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.541
There's many people
with two good legs

23:46.542 --> 23:47.833
who cannot make that claim.

23:47.834 --> 23:50.332
Don't just sit there
like two lazy old men.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.165
It's not going to build
by itself.

23:52.166 --> 23:53.833
He's right.

23:53.834 --> 23:56.165
It's not going
to get built by itself.

23:56.166 --> 23:57.749
Well, listen, padre,

23:57.750 --> 23:59.374
I'd love to stay here
and help you,

23:59.375 --> 24:01.457
but I should really go check on my car.
I'm sure it's done now.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.541
Yes, well, our work is done
for today, señor stanhope.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.542
Gracias.

24:04.543 --> 24:05.874
Hey, these are yours.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.040
God bless you.

24:07.041 --> 24:09.791
Okay.
Pepillo, adiós, amigo.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.375
Adiós, señor Pete.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.457
So, any news?

24:22.458 --> 24:24.874
I can straighten the bracket
and repair the linkage,

24:24.875 --> 24:27.290
but the wheel bearing
and spindle...

24:27.291 --> 24:28.458
They're broken.

24:30.375 --> 24:32.457
Is it fixed?
Can we leave?

24:32.458 --> 24:35.582
No, the mechanic's got to
order some new parts. What?

24:35.583 --> 24:38.749
Yeah, it looks like we're stuck here for
a day, maybe two. You are kidding me!

24:38.750 --> 24:41.749
No. I guess we should start
looking for a hotel room,...

24:41.750 --> 24:43.666
If this town even has a hotel.

24:43.667 --> 24:46.582
Señor Pete,
I take you to la Fonda...

24:46.583 --> 24:48.040
Very good hotel.

24:48.041 --> 24:49.457
Come.
I will show you.

24:49.458 --> 24:51.124
Pepillo, this is my wife, Donna.

24:51.125 --> 24:53.624
Donna, this is pepillo.
Hola.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.040
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

24:55.041 --> 24:57.040
See? And you thought
there wasn't even a hotel here.

24:57.041 --> 24:59.374
Pepillo, are you sure
this is a nice hotel?

24:59.375 --> 25:01.124
It's not
just some old flophouse?

25:01.125 --> 25:03.249
It is the best hotel
in all of dommatina.

25:03.250 --> 25:04.708
You're sure about this?

25:04.709 --> 25:08.917
I am sure, because it is
the only hotel in dommatina.

25:11.709 --> 25:13.875
Come.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.541
You're very fortunate.

25:30.542 --> 25:33.124
In all dommatina,
this is the last room left.

25:33.125 --> 25:35.165
And as you can see,
it's not very romantic.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.290
I fix it for you.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.708
Neither are we...
Very romantic, I mean.

25:38.709 --> 25:41.457
A beautiful place,
a beautiful couple...

25:41.458 --> 25:42.999
Just in time for the fiesta?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.791
No, no, no, no.
Don't rearrange the furniture.

25:44.792 --> 25:46.791
It's fine.
It's not... not necessary.

25:46.792 --> 25:49.457
We are only here for one night,
anyway, so thank you.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.708
As you wish, señorita.

25:50.709 --> 25:52.082
You know what?

25:52.083 --> 25:54.541
Let me give you a little
something extra for your trouble.

25:54.542 --> 25:56.708
No, señor.
You have paid for the room.

25:56.709 --> 25:57.709
It's enough.

25:57.710 --> 26:01.207
Thanks.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.834
Gracias.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.916
You know,
that's the third time today.

26:07.917 --> 26:09.666
Back home,
you can't tip people enough.

26:09.667 --> 26:12.165
Down here,
you can't tip people at all.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.834
Very interesting.

26:46.375 --> 26:48.124
Would you stop pacing?

26:48.125 --> 26:52.082
I just hate being stuck here,
in dommatina, of all places.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.999
If I hadn't crashed the car,
we'd be in San Marcos by now.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.624
Pete, no one is blaming you,
all right?

26:56.625 --> 26:59.916
Let's just get the part in the
morning and get to San Marcos.

26:59.917 --> 27:02.207
Ibuenas noches!

27:02.208 --> 27:03.749
Did you order room service?

27:03.750 --> 27:07.250
I don't think
they have room service here.

27:08.750 --> 27:11.249
What do you call that?

27:11.250 --> 27:14.040
Buenas noches, señor.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.666
I think this is a mistake.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.791
We didn't order this.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.165
No, señor, there's no mistake.

27:19.166 --> 27:24.332
It's a... what do you
call it... a compliment.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.500
Come.
Please, enjoy.

27:31.792 --> 27:34.541
Señorita.

27:34.542 --> 27:36.916
Thank you very much.

27:36.917 --> 27:38.416
Gracias.

27:38.417 --> 27:39.709
Enjoy.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.124
What's so funny?

27:53.125 --> 27:55.082
Nothing.

27:55.083 --> 27:57.082
What is it?

27:57.083 --> 27:59.833
It just reminds me
of our first date.

27:59.834 --> 28:01.082
Remember?

28:01.083 --> 28:02.833
Yeah, I took you
to Rosa's cantina.

28:02.834 --> 28:05.624
No, but remember the mariachis?

28:05.625 --> 28:07.249
How could I forget?

28:07.250 --> 28:09.749
They were so loud, we could
barely hear ourselves think.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.791
I probably gave them 5 bucks
to get them to play,

28:11.792 --> 28:13.833
and I had to give them 10 bucks
to make them stop.

28:13.834 --> 28:16.249
And the waiter
dumped guacamole on me.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.290
Man.

28:17.291 --> 28:18.958
After all that,
you lost your keys,

28:18.959 --> 28:22.165
and you had to walk me all the way
back to campus, remember? Yeah.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.457
Yeah, I got a little secret
to tell you about that.

28:24.458 --> 28:27.290
I, um... I didn't really lose
my keys that night.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.165
You did that on purpose?

28:29.166 --> 28:30.791
Why?

28:30.792 --> 28:33.290
Well, I wasn't ready
for our date to be over.

28:33.291 --> 28:35.874
Why didn't you just ask me
if you could walk me home?

28:35.875 --> 28:36.875
Would you have let me?

28:36.876 --> 28:39.249
Are you kidding?

28:39.250 --> 28:41.916
2 miles in those stiletto heels.
My feet hurt for days.

28:41.917 --> 28:44.500
Well, wasn't I worth a couple of blisters?
At the time.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.332
Yep, that was a long time ago.

28:49.333 --> 28:51.374
I'm not saying we go back.

28:51.375 --> 28:55.541
I'm just... I'm just saying
we have to decide to let it go,

28:55.542 --> 28:56.749
to move on... that's all.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.999
Move on to what, Pete?

28:59.000 --> 29:02.457
This isn't like some building

29:02.458 --> 29:05.332
that... that you just finish
and move on to the next.

29:05.333 --> 29:07.499
This is about starting a family.

29:07.500 --> 29:11.082
You expect me to just say,
"okay, that's fine.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.416
"I'll do without.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.708
We'll be a childless couple
for the rest of our lives."

29:14.709 --> 29:16.416
I don't know
if I can do that, Pete.

29:16.417 --> 29:19.792
Can you not see that?!

29:27.667 --> 29:30.040
Is there something wrong, señor?

29:30.041 --> 29:32.249
No. No.
She's...

29:32.250 --> 29:34.290
She's just a little homesick...
That's all.

29:34.291 --> 29:35.874
Okay.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.582
Señor, señor...

29:37.583 --> 29:39.582
No more music.

29:39.583 --> 29:41.041
Gracias.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.457
You must hurry.
Come.

30:24.458 --> 30:26.374
We must get down to the Plaza
and help father Arturo.

30:26.375 --> 30:27.582
Can't this wait till morning?

30:27.583 --> 30:29.749
Señor Pete, it is morning.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.082
Didn't you hear the rooster?

30:31.083 --> 30:32.083
Is that what that was?

30:32.084 --> 30:33.332
We must hurry.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.249
Father Arturo is waiting for us.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.124
It's not good
to keep a priest waiting.

30:38.125 --> 30:39.457
He works for god.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.582
Right. Right.

30:40.583 --> 30:42.916
We certainly wouldn't want
to do that.

30:42.917 --> 30:45.207
Just, um, give me a minute,
will you, buddy?

30:45.208 --> 30:46.709
Okay.

30:54.166 --> 30:55.208
Where are you going?

30:56.333 --> 30:59.749
Apparently, I'm late for work.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.582
Well, let me know
when the car's ready,

31:01.583 --> 31:02.916
so I can be all set to leave.

31:02.917 --> 31:06.207
Yeah, I'm sure as soon
as the mechanic gets the part,

31:06.208 --> 31:08.125
we'll be on our way.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.582
Hey, buddy.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.207
Señor Pete.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.290
Yeah?

31:23.291 --> 31:24.374
What to know a secret?

31:24.375 --> 31:25.833
Sure.

31:25.834 --> 31:27.833
You know señorita Pete?

31:27.834 --> 31:29.249
You mean Donna?

31:29.250 --> 31:30.374
Yeah, señorita Donna.

31:30.375 --> 31:31.833
Yeah, what about her?

31:31.834 --> 31:33.374
I think she is very beautiful.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.290
Yeah. Yeah.
She is very beautiful.

31:35.291 --> 31:37.290
Hey, why don't you tell her that
next time you see her?

31:37.291 --> 31:38.499
Why don't you tell her?

31:38.500 --> 31:41.124
Well, women like
to hear things like that

31:41.125 --> 31:43.582
from other people
besides their husband.

31:43.583 --> 31:45.999
If señorita Donna was my wife,

31:46.000 --> 31:49.332
I would tell her every day
how beautiful she is.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.917
That way, she will always know
how beautiful she is.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.833
You know, pepillo,
whatever girl ends up with you

31:55.834 --> 31:57.666
is gonna be a very lucky lady.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.290
As lucky as señorita Donna?

31:59.291 --> 32:02.625
I think you're gonna have
to ask her about that.

32:03.667 --> 32:06.499
All right. Put it here.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.959
But be careful.
It's very heavy.

32:11.375 --> 32:14.165
Private stanhope
reporting for duty, sir.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.124
I'm so glad you're still here.

32:16.125 --> 32:17.499
We have much left to do.
Gracias.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.916
All right,
well, let's get at it.

32:18.917 --> 32:20.249
What's first?
What's this thing?

32:20.250 --> 32:22.833
This is the machine
that makes the boy fly.

32:22.834 --> 32:26.040
See, we put the cables,
wrap around here,

32:26.041 --> 32:29.207
and then we attach them
to the Poles.

32:29.208 --> 32:33.374
And then, over here, we put
the seat where the boy sits,

32:33.375 --> 32:35.124
and then he flies
around the Plaza.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.749
What can I do to help?

32:37.750 --> 32:39.666
You know, you can rest
for a little while, okay?

32:39.667 --> 32:41.082
You've been working hard
for two days,

32:41.083 --> 32:43.124
and your leg's a little sore?

32:43.125 --> 32:44.207
Okay.

32:44.208 --> 32:45.749
Adiós, señor Pete.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.333
Okay. See you, buddy. Okay.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.332
What's your...
What's your completion date?

32:51.333 --> 32:52.708
What?

32:52.709 --> 32:54.874
When do you want to be finished?
Today.

32:54.875 --> 32:55.916
Today?
Sí.

32:55.917 --> 32:57.666
Don't you want to give yourself

32:57.667 --> 32:59.333
a little cushion there, padre?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.916
No.

33:02.917 --> 33:05.666
You take this paper.

33:05.667 --> 33:06.916
Did you fold it?

33:06.917 --> 33:08.582
Did you fold it?

33:08.583 --> 33:10.125
Sí. Very well.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.541
Hit it, hit it.
Hit it hard. Hard.

33:14.542 --> 33:15.582
Very good.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.541
Like that.
Hard, hard, hard, hard.

33:17.542 --> 33:19.416
Just like that.

33:19.417 --> 33:20.457
Good job.
Keep like this.

33:20.458 --> 33:21.749
What is this shape
you have here?

33:21.750 --> 33:23.499
Hi.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.749
Hi.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.916
Hola.
I see you're still here.

33:26.917 --> 33:29.082
Yeah, well,
our car's still being fixed.

33:29.083 --> 33:30.207
We got to wait for a part,

33:30.208 --> 33:31.874
so we'll probably be here
another day.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.916
Well, I'm sorry about your car,

33:33.917 --> 33:35.749
but not really, 'cause
then you can help us bake.

33:35.750 --> 33:38.582
Well, I don't know
if I remember how to bake.

33:38.583 --> 33:39.583
You don't bake at home?

33:39.584 --> 33:40.999
Not since I was a little girl.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.040
It's time
to learn again, you know,

33:43.041 --> 33:45.207
'cause everybody needs
to learn how to bake

33:45.208 --> 33:47.290
so we can teach our children,
right, kids?

33:47.291 --> 33:50.374
Are you sure
these things will hold?

33:50.375 --> 33:52.541
Well, they always have.

33:52.542 --> 33:55.541
So, tell me,
life in the north...

33:55.542 --> 33:57.624
Is it different
from life in dommatina?

33:57.625 --> 34:00.332
Well, there's certainly
less traffic here.

34:00.333 --> 34:04.457
In Los Angeles,
you need a car for everything.

34:04.458 --> 34:07.416
You drive to work.
You drive home.

34:07.417 --> 34:10.998
If you're hungry, you drive
to the market or a restaurant.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.958
I swear, I spend more time
in my car than I do at my house.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.958
Well, your wife...

34:15.958 --> 34:17.541
She must be happy
you work so hard.

34:17.542 --> 34:19.248
She works, too.
We both work.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.373
Everybody works.

34:20.375 --> 34:23.040
Who takes care of the children?

34:23.041 --> 34:24.498
We don't have any children.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.081
No children.

34:27.083 --> 34:29.542
Well, you're still young.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.206
What's your name?
Donna.

34:35.208 --> 34:37.040
Donna, magdelena.
Nice to meet you.

34:37.041 --> 34:38.833
Kids, say hi to Donna.

34:38.833 --> 34:40.873
Hi, Donna. Hi, Donna. Hi, Donna.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.081
Very good.
Okay.

34:42.083 --> 34:45.165
We are going to show this lady
how to make buns.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.666
How do we make buns?

34:46.667 --> 34:48.581
First, you mix it.

34:48.583 --> 34:49.833
Very well!

34:49.833 --> 34:51.541
Okay, so, we're gonna
teach her that, okay?

34:51.542 --> 34:53.248
You ready
to get your hands dirty?

34:53.250 --> 34:55.623
Absolutely. Sure. Okay, good.

34:55.625 --> 34:56.998
Keep pounding.
Keep pounding.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.375
Hard, hard, hard,
hard, hard, hard.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.624
I mean, it's not like
we haven't been trying.

35:03.625 --> 35:04.833
Trying?

35:04.834 --> 35:06.124
To have a baby.

35:06.125 --> 35:08.666
I mean, at first,
we didn't worry about it.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.582
You know, sometimes
these things take a while.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.207
But then when it didn't happen,

35:12.208 --> 35:16.374
then we started trying
harder and harder,

35:16.375 --> 35:18.040
and not the normal way,
mind you.

35:18.041 --> 35:19.708
That I wouldn't have minded,
believe me.

35:19.709 --> 35:23.165
But it was frozen this
and frozen that

35:23.166 --> 35:27.332
and test tubes
and microscopes and drugs

35:27.333 --> 35:30.499
and not to mention
the special herbs and the teas

35:30.500 --> 35:32.541
and the... the meditations
and the yoga

35:32.542 --> 35:35.457
and taking her temperature
every hour

35:35.458 --> 35:37.958
and then the mad dashes home,
just so we could...

35:37.959 --> 35:40.249
You know... you know,
try to make a baby.

35:40.250 --> 35:41.582
Sí. Sí.

35:41.583 --> 35:44.082
And the money.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.874
You have no idea
how much these things cost,

35:46.875 --> 35:49.582
between the doctors
and the lab work.

35:49.583 --> 35:52.417
And of course, none
of it's covered by insurance.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.958
Suffice it to say,
it's been a struggle.

35:55.959 --> 35:58.249
Yes, but you still love
each other. ¿sí?

35:58.250 --> 35:59.749
That's the important thing.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.833
Yeah, but if I can't give her
what she wants,

36:01.834 --> 36:03.457
what's the point?

36:03.458 --> 36:05.499
You said it yourself...
We're still young.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.666
We could both start over.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.708
I think that would be
the biggest act of selfishness,

36:10.709 --> 36:12.833
not love.
How so?

36:12.834 --> 36:16.374
I would not abandon her
to face her burdens alone.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.374
I would strive to make
her burdens lighter...

36:18.375 --> 36:20.416
Her sorrows easier to bear.

36:20.417 --> 36:22.958
Love will not fix these things
that trouble you,

36:22.959 --> 36:25.124
but it will give your union
the strength

36:25.125 --> 36:28.874
to find its way through
the journey of life together.

36:28.875 --> 36:31.166
But that's just the opinion
of one Mexican priest.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.791
Let's check to see
if these cookies are ready.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.457
Are they finished?
Are they ready? Are they ready?

36:52.458 --> 36:54.457
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

36:54.458 --> 36:56.500
That's too hot.
That's too hot for you.

36:57.959 --> 36:59.791
Not quite ready!

36:59.792 --> 37:01.290
Okay, here we go.

37:01.291 --> 37:03.708
Hey, Teri, should we check
to see the cookies?

37:03.709 --> 37:05.207
I know you wanted to come look.

37:05.208 --> 37:07.082
You come look, 'cause these were
some of your special cookies.

37:07.083 --> 37:09.791
Let's see.
Let's see.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.290
Are they ready?

37:12.291 --> 37:14.374
No, not ready.
Not yet.

37:14.375 --> 37:15.874
Almost.

37:15.875 --> 37:17.207
And then?
Hey.

37:17.208 --> 37:19.332
Hi.

37:19.333 --> 37:21.708
Okay.
Go back to magdelena.

37:21.709 --> 37:22.833
You go see magdelena.

37:22.834 --> 37:24.958
Come here, pretty thing.

37:24.959 --> 37:26.999
Hello.
What are you doing?

37:27.000 --> 37:30.165
We're, making conchitas
for the fiesta.

37:30.166 --> 37:31.582
But you don't bake.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.332
I bought you that bread maker
for Christmas.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.708
You never took it
out of the box.

37:34.709 --> 37:36.708
That's not real baking, is it?

37:36.709 --> 37:39.833
Real baking, you... you mix
the dough by yourself

37:39.834 --> 37:41.165
and knead it with your hands

37:41.166 --> 37:44.290
and get it in your hair
and your fingernails.

37:44.291 --> 37:47.332
Yeah, I used to do that
when I was a kid.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.874
Iseñorita, señorita!

37:48.875 --> 37:50.416
Ilas conchitas!

37:50.417 --> 37:51.999
Oops.
Conchitas are ready.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.165
I'll see you later.

37:55.166 --> 37:57.541
Okay, I think they're ready,
you guys.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.374
Come on, let's see!
Come on, Mia.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.499
Thanks for telling me
that they're ready.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.625
Are you ready?

38:05.709 --> 38:07.624
Hola, Juan.
Hola, señor.

38:07.625 --> 38:09.874
We get the part?
No, not yet.

38:09.875 --> 38:11.541
Well, did they say when?

38:11.542 --> 38:12.958
It's a difficult part to find.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.958
There were none.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.332
I think we're gonna have
to order special.

38:16.333 --> 38:17.457
Well, how long
is that gonna take?

38:17.458 --> 38:19.541
Well, maybe another day,
maybe two.

38:19.542 --> 38:20.791
That's bad news.

38:20.792 --> 38:22.541
That is not bad news.

38:22.542 --> 38:24.833
That's good news.
How do you figure?

38:24.834 --> 38:27.666
Well, if you know the part
is now coming in two days,

38:27.667 --> 38:29.499
you can just relax,
enjoy yourself,

38:29.500 --> 38:31.040
and not worry about it.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.999
If you're lucky enough,
maybe three days.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.207
And if you're very lucky,

38:34.208 --> 38:35.874
it won't get here
until after the fiesta.

38:35.875 --> 38:38.583
It all depends
what you consider luck.

38:42.208 --> 38:43.624
Do you want buns?

38:43.625 --> 38:44.874
Very good!

38:44.875 --> 38:46.332
Very good!

38:46.333 --> 38:47.541
All right, so...

38:47.542 --> 38:49.749
And 1... 2...

38:49.750 --> 38:50.791
Conchitas are ready!

38:50.792 --> 38:52.250
Look how good they look.

38:53.667 --> 38:54.749
You know what?

38:54.750 --> 38:57.040
They look very good,
but they're so hot.

38:57.041 --> 39:00.040
Very hot.
So... It's siesta time.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.749
When we get back,
it's gonna be cool. Yay!

39:01.750 --> 39:03.541
Okay?
Let's go. Let's go.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.207
Come on, baby.
I'm sorry.

39:05.208 --> 39:06.290
Yay!

39:06.291 --> 39:07.666
♪ Let's sleep ♪

39:07.667 --> 39:09.040
♪ let's dream ♪

39:09.041 --> 39:11.582
♪ let's go to be to rest ♪

39:11.583 --> 39:12.999
♪ let's sleep ♪

39:13.000 --> 39:14.624
Very good, guys.
All right.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.958
Yay!
There you go.

39:16.959 --> 39:19.542
I don't want to go.
It's too dark.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.040
What'd she say?

39:22.041 --> 39:23.874
She's afraid of the dark.

39:23.875 --> 39:26.457
Honey. Well, then, you
should stay right here with us.

39:26.458 --> 39:27.874
Come here.

39:27.875 --> 39:28.916
Look at that.

39:28.917 --> 39:30.625
Yes, yes.

39:34.959 --> 39:36.499
Here we go.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
You just rest right there.

39:40.542 --> 39:42.791
So, tell me, how did
you meet your husband?

39:42.792 --> 39:44.082
My goodness.

39:44.083 --> 39:46.374
It was so long ago,
I don't think I even remember.

39:46.375 --> 39:48.124
Stop.
Nonsense.

39:48.125 --> 39:49.708
Every girl remembers.

39:49.709 --> 39:51.249
So, tell me.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.541
My goodness.

39:52.542 --> 39:55.249
Well, I was...
I was working in a bank,

39:55.250 --> 40:00.165
and this very handsome man
came walking in the bank

40:00.166 --> 40:02.332
and... and handed me a note.

40:02.333 --> 40:05.416
And I thought, "my gosh!
It's a stickup!"

40:05.417 --> 40:07.624
But, no.

40:07.625 --> 40:10.666
The note read, "you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen,

40:10.667 --> 40:12.082
and would you have dinner
with me?"

40:12.083 --> 40:15.124
A proposal
from a complete stranger.

40:15.125 --> 40:16.541
Well, he wasn't
a complete stranger.

40:16.542 --> 40:17.833
I'd seen him at school.

40:17.834 --> 40:21.124
He was an engineering student,
and I was a business major,

40:21.125 --> 40:23.249
but, but definitely not
your most usual

40:23.250 --> 40:25.499
of bank transactions,
I have to say.

40:25.500 --> 40:26.874
Apparently not.

40:26.875 --> 40:28.582
So, what did you say?

40:28.583 --> 40:30.166
Well, I said yes, of course.

40:31.333 --> 40:33.666
But only after he opened up
an account with us...

40:33.667 --> 40:35.333
A savings account, mind you.

40:37.583 --> 40:38.624
And did he?

40:38.625 --> 40:40.207
He did.
Yes, he did.

40:40.208 --> 40:42.124
I think he had to borrow
the money from his roommate,

40:42.125 --> 40:43.165
but he sure did.

40:43.166 --> 40:44.749
That's funny.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.624
That's a really good story.

40:47.625 --> 40:48.999
Is she out?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.791
Yeah, she's pretty much out.

40:50.792 --> 40:52.500
Let me go.

41:02.583 --> 41:04.666
There we go.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.667
Gracias.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.624
Goal!

41:20.625 --> 41:21.916
Yes!

41:21.917 --> 41:23.082
No, no.
Yes!

41:23.083 --> 41:24.457
No, no, no.
That wasn't a goal.

41:24.458 --> 41:25.834
You want to see a goal?

41:27.417 --> 41:29.124
All right,
I'll show you a goal, buddy.

41:29.125 --> 41:30.125
All right.

41:30.126 --> 41:31.374
You want to see a goal, big boy?

41:31.375 --> 41:32.499
Come on.
You want to see...

41:32.500 --> 41:33.833
Come on.
Your feet are slow.

41:33.834 --> 41:35.165
Are you kidding me?
All right.

41:35.166 --> 41:37.249
Okay.
All right.

41:37.250 --> 41:38.749
I see how you are, buddy.

41:38.750 --> 41:40.082
Okay, you want to play?
Yes.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.791
I'll play you, although
I do have to warn you...

41:42.792 --> 41:45.959
I was a starting forward
for the west valley wolverines.

41:47.125 --> 41:49.916
Of course,
that was 20 years ago.

41:49.917 --> 41:51.499
Goal!
Pepillo!

41:51.500 --> 41:52.958
You're pretty good, man.

41:52.959 --> 41:55.833
You play pretty well for a kid
with only one good leg.

41:55.834 --> 41:58.165
All right, here we go.
Best 2 out of 3, okay? All right.

41:58.166 --> 41:59.249
Here we go.
What do you got?

41:59.250 --> 42:00.958
Show me what you got.
You ready?

42:00.959 --> 42:01.959
Let's go.
You ready?

42:03.125 --> 42:04.332
Come on.

42:04.333 --> 42:07.083
A great goal!

42:09.500 --> 42:11.332
Who taught you
how to play like that?

42:11.333 --> 42:12.624
My papa.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.999
When you have a son like me,
you can teach him.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.249
Are you kidding me?

42:16.250 --> 42:17.958
If I have a kid,
I'm gonna bring him down here

42:17.959 --> 42:19.290
and let you teach him
how to play.

42:19.291 --> 42:21.165
No.
That's papa's job.

42:21.166 --> 42:23.666
Really?
And what's mama's job?

42:23.667 --> 42:27.082
Well, to tuck you in bed,
kiss you,

42:27.083 --> 42:29.332
and, at night,
sing a song to you.

42:29.333 --> 42:30.749
And did your mama sing?

42:30.750 --> 42:32.541
She would always sing.

42:32.542 --> 42:34.624
She would sing
this nice song to me

42:34.625 --> 42:36.958
every time
I finished my prayers.

42:36.959 --> 42:39.749
♪ Go to sleep, my child ♪

42:39.750 --> 42:41.624
♪ go to sleep, my sunshine ♪

42:41.625 --> 42:45.916
♪ go to sleep,
piece of my heart ♪

42:45.917 --> 42:47.874
And what does that mean...
Something about your heart?

42:47.875 --> 42:50.249
Not my heart.
Her heart.

42:50.250 --> 42:53.040
♪ Go to sleep, my child ♪

42:53.041 --> 42:55.332
♪ go to sleep, my sunshine ♪

42:55.333 --> 43:00.625
♪ you will always be
in this heart of mine ♪

43:02.375 --> 43:04.958
That's a beautiful song.

43:04.959 --> 43:07.834
I'm sure your mother
loved you very much.

43:14.625 --> 43:16.500
Thank you, girlfriend.

43:17.875 --> 43:19.416
Tomorrow.

43:19.417 --> 43:20.624
She's crazy.

43:20.625 --> 43:22.332
Thank you.

43:22.333 --> 43:23.666
All right, so, it's your turn.

43:23.667 --> 43:25.040
How did you meet Juan?

43:25.041 --> 43:28.124
Well, I was straight out of
the university in Guadalajara,

43:28.125 --> 43:30.499
and they said that they needed
a teacher here in dommatina.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.791
So I said, "I'll go."

43:31.792 --> 43:33.708
My friends thought I was crazy

43:33.709 --> 43:36.499
because I was gonna leave
the city to come here.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.874
So, my first day of school,
I looked down,

43:38.875 --> 43:43.249
and there's pepillo smiling up
at me with his little bad leg.

43:43.250 --> 43:46.916
And he goes, "my brother Juan
is the best mechanic in town,

43:46.917 --> 43:49.124
"and he deserves
a beautiful wife.

43:49.125 --> 43:52.417
Would you like to meet him?
He's right there in the garage."

43:54.041 --> 43:55.374
How could I resist, you know?

43:55.375 --> 43:59.541
That's a good story, too.

43:59.542 --> 44:02.207
That must have been quite a change,
though... I mean, living here.

44:02.208 --> 44:03.208
Do you miss the city at all?

44:03.209 --> 44:06.207
I did a little bit
in the beginning,

44:06.208 --> 44:09.416
but then, after a while,
not so much.

44:09.417 --> 44:11.082
I like this place.

44:11.083 --> 44:13.332
It's a good place to live,

44:13.333 --> 44:16.541
and the people
are really good people.

44:16.542 --> 44:18.999
I mean, I have Juan.
I have my work.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.999
I have all the children.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.249
What else do I need?

44:22.250 --> 44:25.124
Now, Juan and pepillo...
They're brothers, right?

44:25.125 --> 44:26.416
Where are their parents?

44:26.417 --> 44:29.416
Their parents died
when pepillo was very young.

44:29.417 --> 44:30.916
I'm so sorry.

44:30.917 --> 44:33.833
It must be very hard on Juan,

44:33.834 --> 44:37.541
having to be both a brother
and a parent?

44:37.542 --> 44:40.249
Yeah, I thought it was...
It was so sad at first...

44:40.250 --> 44:41.416
Pepillo with no parents.

44:41.417 --> 44:44.999
But now, I mean, the whole
village takes care of him.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.624
They love him so much.

44:46.625 --> 44:48.250
It's like they're family.

44:49.917 --> 44:54.457
Well, so what happens after
you and Juan get married?

44:54.458 --> 44:55.624
With pepillo?
Yeah.

44:55.625 --> 44:57.416
I'll love him like my own son.

44:57.417 --> 44:58.958
But after you get married,
you and Juan

44:58.959 --> 45:00.624
will want to have
your own children, right?

45:00.625 --> 45:03.708
Sure,
but it's... it's not up to us.

45:03.709 --> 45:05.124
It's up to god.

45:05.125 --> 45:08.082
If he wants us to have children,
then perfect.

45:08.083 --> 45:09.165
We're gonna love them.

45:09.166 --> 45:12.666
If he doesn't,
we still have each other.

45:12.667 --> 45:15.833
I mean, I believe,
as long as I'm a good wife

45:15.834 --> 45:19.457
and he's a good husband
and we love each other...

45:19.458 --> 45:22.959
If we do that, whatever happens,
it's gonna be okay.

45:24.917 --> 45:27.083
See you later.
Come to the shade.

45:32.250 --> 45:34.165
Hey, how's your leg doing,
buddy?

45:34.166 --> 45:35.457
Good.

45:35.458 --> 45:36.582
Always the same.

45:36.583 --> 45:37.874
Want to know a secret?

45:37.875 --> 45:40.165
It's not another one
about my wife, is it?

45:40.166 --> 45:43.290
No.
This one's a real secret.

45:43.291 --> 45:45.416
It's something no one else
in the whole world knows.

45:45.417 --> 45:47.374
That sounds like
a pretty important secret.

45:47.375 --> 45:50.499
You sure you want to entrust it to me?
Yeah, I do.

45:50.500 --> 45:54.666
You know how San Judas tadeo
turned a little boy into a dove,

45:54.667 --> 45:57.124
and after he flew three times
around the Plaza,

45:57.125 --> 45:59.165
he made it so he could walk?

45:59.166 --> 46:01.082
Yeah, father Arturo
told me that story.

46:01.083 --> 46:05.457
Last night, before I sleep,
I prayed to San Judas tadeo.

46:05.458 --> 46:08.040
And in my dreams,
you know what he says? What?

46:08.041 --> 46:10.416
He says
he will do the same for me.

46:10.417 --> 46:13.457
When it's my turn to fly
and when it is over,

46:13.458 --> 46:15.332
he will make it so I can walk.

46:15.333 --> 46:19.040
He will fix my leg,
and the pain will be gone.

46:19.041 --> 46:21.124
Are you sure
that's what he said?

46:21.125 --> 46:22.791
"Pepillo," he said,

46:22.792 --> 46:26.124
"if you believe
in the miracle of dommatina

46:26.125 --> 46:30.290
with all your heart, I can make
it so you are healed."

46:30.291 --> 46:33.082
Pepillo, there you are.

46:33.083 --> 46:35.916
You can't tell anyone.
Remember, it's our secret.

46:35.917 --> 46:37.624
Yeah, I promise.

46:37.625 --> 46:38.833
Good evening, señor Pete.
Hey.

46:38.834 --> 46:40.290
Come on, pepillo.
We're late.

46:40.291 --> 46:41.833
Magdelena has supper for us.

46:41.834 --> 46:44.874
Let's go.

46:44.875 --> 46:46.833
I see that you're finished.
Yeah.

46:46.834 --> 46:49.040
You're getting
much too heavy to carry.

46:49.041 --> 46:51.582
After sunday,
I'm gonna be light as a feather.

46:51.583 --> 46:53.457
Him and his flying.

46:53.458 --> 46:54.624
You might actually think

46:54.625 --> 46:56.541
he's gonna turn into a bird
or something.

46:56.542 --> 46:59.374
Hey, tonight, magdelena and I
are going for a walk.

46:59.375 --> 47:01.249
Why don't you tell señorita
Donna, and you meet us there?

47:01.250 --> 47:02.250
Yeah, sure.

47:02.250 --> 47:03.166
Yeah?
Yeah.

47:03.167 --> 47:04.416
Okay, see you there.

47:04.417 --> 47:06.166
Come on.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.417
Sure hope
you know what you're doing.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.875
Amen.

47:40.375 --> 47:43.082
Today, we finished the máquina.

47:43.083 --> 47:45.708
Father Arturo helped, too,

47:45.709 --> 47:48.958
but it was
mostly me and señor Pete.

47:48.959 --> 47:50.999
You would like señor Pete.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.791
He thinks he is very good
at soccer, but he's really bad.

47:55.792 --> 47:58.791
He's sometimes sad
about something.

47:58.792 --> 48:00.290
I don't know why,

48:00.291 --> 48:04.165
but someday
he might just tell me.

48:04.166 --> 48:07.040
I wish you were here...
You and papa, too...

48:07.041 --> 48:11.834
But I guess you guys
can see from up there.

48:14.917 --> 48:16.457
Turn off the light, little guy.

48:16.458 --> 48:17.792
Time to go to sleep.

48:19.625 --> 48:21.000
Is it really bad tonight?

48:22.500 --> 48:23.541
You worked really hard.

48:23.542 --> 48:25.333
It will be better.

48:26.917 --> 48:28.332
Okay.

48:28.333 --> 48:29.792
Let's do this.

48:33.667 --> 48:34.874
Good night, little brother.

48:34.875 --> 48:35.958
Good night, big brother.

48:35.959 --> 48:37.834
Sweet dreams.
Okay.

48:48.667 --> 48:51.207
He doesn't know
about the miracle yet,

48:51.208 --> 48:54.667
but it's better to keep it
as a surprise.

49:07.667 --> 49:10.457
Buenas noches.

49:10.458 --> 49:14.874
Do you guys know that Juan was
the boy chosen to fly once?

49:14.875 --> 49:17.374
It runs in the family,

49:17.375 --> 49:18.541
Were you scared?

49:18.542 --> 49:21.040
A little bit,
but mamá and papá were there,

49:21.041 --> 49:24.165
so I knew nothing bad would
happen if they were there.

49:24.166 --> 49:26.582
They would be so proud
of pepillo right now.

49:26.583 --> 49:29.541
Yeah.
Very, very proud of him.

49:29.542 --> 49:31.207
You know, I've been thinking.

49:31.208 --> 49:32.416
You've been thinking?

49:32.417 --> 49:34.458
Ha ha ha.
What's the occasion?

49:36.208 --> 49:38.124
No, perhaps... I don't know...

49:38.125 --> 49:39.958
But maybe after we get married,

49:39.959 --> 49:41.749
maybe we could move
into the city.

49:41.750 --> 49:43.582
What, and leave dommatina?

49:43.583 --> 49:44.833
Well, I just...

49:44.834 --> 49:47.165
I just think there would be
more work for me there

49:47.166 --> 49:49.791
and, more opportunities
for pepillo.

49:49.792 --> 49:52.249
And you say you like the city,
too, no?

49:52.250 --> 49:54.082
Well, yeah.

49:54.083 --> 49:56.249
Well, señor Pete,
you live in the city.

49:56.250 --> 49:57.833
Don't you think
it's a good option?

49:57.834 --> 49:59.582
Well, the city's exciting.

49:59.583 --> 50:01.290
There's always lots
to see and do

50:01.291 --> 50:02.916
and lots of great restaurants.

50:02.917 --> 50:04.916
You see?
I told you it was a good idea.

50:04.917 --> 50:07.416
Yeah, but it's also
very noisy and crowded,

50:07.417 --> 50:09.249
very easy to lose sight
of what's important,

50:09.250 --> 50:13.791
like family and intimacy
and the simple pleasures,

50:13.792 --> 50:15.457
all the things
that you have here.

50:15.458 --> 50:19.541
You would leave your friends,
your family, this place,

50:19.542 --> 50:21.582
just to go to a city?

50:21.583 --> 50:23.582
Why would you want to do that?

50:23.583 --> 50:25.290
I thought
it would make you happy.

50:25.291 --> 50:29.125
Juan, I'm only happy
because I'm with you.

50:33.417 --> 50:34.916
I love you, magdelena.

50:34.917 --> 50:36.709
I love you, too.

50:39.750 --> 50:41.749
Donna, you awake?

50:41.750 --> 50:43.207
Yeah.

50:43.208 --> 50:45.040
Have you ever seen a miracle?

50:45.041 --> 50:47.165
No, Pete, I have not.

50:47.166 --> 50:49.249
Did you see
magdelena and Juan tonight?

50:49.250 --> 50:51.666
They love each other so much,
you know.

50:51.667 --> 50:55.416
Just 'cause they're affectionate
doesn't mean...

50:55.417 --> 50:58.124
Don't reduce what they have
to puppy love, Pete.

50:58.125 --> 50:59.582
I wasn't.

50:59.583 --> 51:03.833
I mean, we... we used
to be affectionate

51:03.834 --> 51:05.958
when we were
as young as they are.

51:05.959 --> 51:08.041
We're still affectionate.

51:09.625 --> 51:12.666
To answer your question,
no, I've never seen a miracle.

51:12.667 --> 51:14.541
Do you think they're possible?

51:14.542 --> 51:17.249
You mean the water
changing into wine...

51:17.250 --> 51:18.958
That kind of miracle?
Yeah.

51:18.959 --> 51:21.290
Yeah, a real,
honest-to-goodness miracle.

51:21.291 --> 51:22.457
I don't know.

51:22.458 --> 51:25.124
Boy, I hope so.

51:25.125 --> 51:28.917
Or that's gonna be
one disappointed little boy.

51:31.834 --> 51:33.333
Good night.

51:37.792 --> 51:39.875
Good night.

51:47.333 --> 51:49.332
Iseñor Pete!

51:49.333 --> 51:50.833
Iseñor Pete!

51:50.834 --> 51:52.374
Time to get up!

51:52.375 --> 51:53.749
It's morning!

51:53.750 --> 51:55.040
Iseñor Pete!

51:55.041 --> 51:56.500
Iseñor Pete!

51:59.792 --> 52:01.290
Iseñor Pete!

52:01.291 --> 52:02.709
Iseñor Pete!

52:04.166 --> 52:06.500
Iseñor Pete!

52:09.375 --> 52:11.624
¿Señor Pete?

52:11.625 --> 52:13.374
Iseñor Pete!
What now?

52:13.375 --> 52:15.124
Quickly.
We must go.

52:15.125 --> 52:17.082
Why?
The pilot.

52:17.083 --> 52:18.207
We must hurry!

52:18.208 --> 52:21.582
Let me just put on some pants.

52:21.583 --> 52:24.541
You got to be kidding me.

52:24.542 --> 52:25.874
What's going on?

52:25.875 --> 52:27.749
Apparently, they're bringing in
a test pilot.

52:27.750 --> 52:30.165
Where are you going?

52:30.166 --> 52:33.208
Well, you're not the only one
who works in this house.

52:55.917 --> 52:57.417
Shut up!

52:59.917 --> 53:02.165
What's the pig doing here?
It's the pilot.

53:02.166 --> 53:04.708
The pig belongs to the pilot.

53:04.709 --> 53:08.667
No, señor Pete.
The pig is the pilot.

53:10.500 --> 53:11.874
Sí.

53:11.875 --> 53:14.124
The test pilot
is really a test pig?

53:14.125 --> 53:15.834
Sí, sí.

53:19.041 --> 53:20.582
Juan?
This is one!

53:20.583 --> 53:21.583
Juanito?

53:26.959 --> 53:27.999
What's going on?

53:28.000 --> 53:29.082
It doesn't work.

53:29.083 --> 53:30.582
Nothing works, magdelena.

53:30.583 --> 53:32.791
Aren't you supposed to be
helping father Arturo?

53:32.792 --> 53:35.416
I was there, magdelena, but then I
came to see señor Pete's part arrive,

53:35.417 --> 53:36.624
and they didn't arrive.

53:36.625 --> 53:38.624
So I tried to fix it myself,
and the wrench broke!

53:38.625 --> 53:40.708
So this is why you're so angry?

53:40.709 --> 53:42.958
The parts were supposed to be
delivered today, magdelena.

53:42.959 --> 53:45.040
You know that. I know.
I understand.

53:45.041 --> 53:47.542
But getting this angry
isn't gonna speed anything up.

53:49.375 --> 53:50.792
Come on, babe.

53:53.917 --> 53:55.624
You're always trying
to fix everything,

53:55.625 --> 53:56.916
and you can't do that.

53:56.917 --> 53:58.499
So why don't
you just take a break

53:58.500 --> 53:59.666
and go help father Arturo,

53:59.667 --> 54:01.499
where you actually can
help something?

54:01.500 --> 54:02.999
Hola.
Hola.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.165
Torito.

54:04.166 --> 54:05.499
I love you, torito.

54:05.500 --> 54:06.541
I love you.

54:06.542 --> 54:09.374
Neh!

54:09.375 --> 54:10.666
What's a torito?

54:10.667 --> 54:13.000
Torito?
That's a... it's a small bull.

54:14.417 --> 54:17.165
I just call him like that
when he gets angry like that.

54:17.166 --> 54:19.165
Well,
at least you made him laugh.

54:19.166 --> 54:21.374
Pete gets mad sometimes.

54:21.375 --> 54:24.374
I wish I could make him laugh.
I feel like crying sometimes.

54:24.375 --> 54:26.332
Well, it's easy to make
this one laugh,

54:26.333 --> 54:27.958
because he's not angry at me,
really,

54:27.959 --> 54:29.749
or the part or anything.

54:29.750 --> 54:31.999
He just blames himself
for what happened to pepillo,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.165
and he always gets like this.

54:34.166 --> 54:35.666
But that was an accident.

54:35.667 --> 54:36.999
Yeah, I know, but, you know,

54:37.000 --> 54:39.290
he wishes something else
could have been done...

54:39.291 --> 54:41.582
Perhaps take him to the city,
to a big hospital,

54:41.583 --> 54:43.791
but he couldn't do that,
'cause he couldn't afford it,

54:43.792 --> 54:45.708
so that's why he gets like that.

54:45.709 --> 54:48.374
He's very lucky to have
such an understanding woman.

54:48.375 --> 54:51.374
I think I'm the lucky one,

54:51.375 --> 54:53.708
'cause I'd rather
have him care that much

54:53.709 --> 54:54.792
than not care at all.

54:58.250 --> 54:59.457
You have to be very careful.

54:59.458 --> 55:01.375
You have to tighten there.

55:02.667 --> 55:04.875
Yes. I know.

55:06.417 --> 55:07.541
Are we too late?

55:07.542 --> 55:09.249
Nope, just in time.

55:09.250 --> 55:11.541
Where's Pete?
He's right there.

55:11.542 --> 55:13.416
He's helping
father Arturo fly the pig.

55:13.417 --> 55:14.874
Pig?

55:14.875 --> 55:17.582
Yeah.
That's our test pilot.

55:17.583 --> 55:18.708
Don't worry.
You'll understand.

55:18.709 --> 55:20.916
It's a custom we have.

55:20.917 --> 55:23.500
Secondaries and
the safety harness on him.

55:24.583 --> 55:25.666
Okay.

55:25.667 --> 55:26.833
All right.
Let's get down.

55:26.834 --> 55:29.249
You need a hand there, padre?

55:29.250 --> 55:30.834
You okay?

55:37.041 --> 55:38.082
Wow!

55:38.083 --> 55:40.916
Flying meat!

55:40.917 --> 55:42.416
No.

55:42.417 --> 55:44.582
The pig likes it, too.

55:44.583 --> 55:45.791
Yes.

55:45.792 --> 55:47.833
Wow.

55:47.834 --> 55:48.958
He's going fast.

55:48.959 --> 55:50.166
Yeah.

55:54.417 --> 55:56.165
Unbelievable.

55:56.166 --> 55:57.917
Poor pig!

56:01.959 --> 56:04.417
How fun!

56:07.917 --> 56:10.165
Is everything okay?

56:10.166 --> 56:11.791
Did he fix it?
I don't know.

56:11.792 --> 56:12.959
Um...

56:14.333 --> 56:15.833
What's happening?

56:15.834 --> 56:17.666
Maybe you should bring the pig
in for a landing.

56:17.667 --> 56:19.791
No, he is going too wide.

56:19.792 --> 56:20.958
It would be unsafe.

56:20.959 --> 56:23.124
Better slow down a little bit.

56:23.125 --> 56:25.624
Um, padre, c-can I help?

56:25.625 --> 56:27.624
Yeah, yes, pull this rope
as hard as you can. Okay.

56:27.625 --> 56:29.040
Pete, is everything okay?

56:29.041 --> 56:30.332
Careful. Careful.

56:30.333 --> 56:32.125
Harder. Harder.
Pull harder.

56:33.208 --> 56:34.333
No!

56:38.500 --> 56:40.416
Stay back.
Stay back.

56:40.417 --> 56:43.374
Take it down. Take it down.
Take it down. Take it down.

56:43.375 --> 56:45.083
Stay with me.

56:46.500 --> 56:47.875
Aah!

56:49.166 --> 56:50.332
He's coming down.

56:50.333 --> 56:52.417
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.166
Get the pig! Get the pig!

57:00.542 --> 57:01.917
No!
The pig!

57:03.917 --> 57:06.040
No!

57:06.041 --> 57:07.500
No!

57:13.500 --> 57:15.040
It's okay.

57:15.041 --> 57:16.791
I'm sure we can fly next year.
No!

57:16.792 --> 57:19.374
Pepillo, where you going?
Come back, please.

57:19.375 --> 57:20.624
You lied to me.

57:20.625 --> 57:23.541
There is no miracle
of dommatina.

57:23.542 --> 57:25.666
It's all a lie!

57:25.667 --> 57:28.666
Padre...
Padre, please forgive him.

57:28.667 --> 57:31.207
He didn't mean
to offend a Saint.

57:31.208 --> 57:32.457
You're standing here,

57:32.458 --> 57:34.624
asking for forgiveness
when he needs you?

57:34.625 --> 57:35.708
Go to him.

57:35.709 --> 57:37.625
Pepillo!

57:40.709 --> 57:42.499
What are we gonna do now?

57:42.500 --> 57:43.958
Can we fix this?

57:43.959 --> 57:45.499
No, it is ruined,

57:45.500 --> 57:48.749
and there's not enough time
to fix it if we could.

57:48.750 --> 57:50.290
I have to tell the town

57:50.291 --> 57:53.709
that the fiesta
of San Judas tadeo is canceled.

57:56.750 --> 57:59.916
Pete, can't you do something
to fix this?

57:59.917 --> 58:01.332
What would you suggest?

58:01.333 --> 58:02.708
Well, you're the engineer.

58:02.709 --> 58:04.082
If you can build skyscrapers,

58:04.083 --> 58:06.082
you can certainly fix this,
don't you think?

58:06.083 --> 58:09.082
It's not that simple.
You can't just string it up.

58:09.083 --> 58:10.708
It has to be totally redesigned.

58:10.709 --> 58:12.792
Well, can't you at least try?

58:39.417 --> 58:42.583
Well, you're awful chipper,
given the day's events.

58:45.291 --> 58:47.457
So...

58:47.458 --> 58:51.457
If I fix this thing
so pepillo can fly,

58:51.458 --> 58:56.333
but he doesn't get his miracle,
the kid's gonna be heartbroken.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.124
Of course,
if he doesn't get to fly at all,

59:01.125 --> 59:03.500
that's gonna break his heart,
too.

59:05.250 --> 59:09.417
Either way, that kid's
in for a major disappointment.

59:11.750 --> 59:13.041
So...

59:14.959 --> 59:18.666
What do you think...

59:18.667 --> 59:21.333
Fix it or no?

59:22.709 --> 59:24.708
Pay or don't pay?

59:24.709 --> 59:28.541
Try to have a kid or don't?

59:28.542 --> 59:30.166
I don't know.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.499
What... no advice?

59:33.500 --> 59:36.500
No saintly wisdom to impart?

59:39.125 --> 59:40.791
You cannot blame yourself

59:40.792 --> 59:42.417
For the disappointments
of others.

59:43.834 --> 59:45.416
You scared me half to death.

59:45.417 --> 59:47.332
I thought the old man
had come back to life.

59:47.333 --> 59:49.541
Well, he is alive.

59:49.542 --> 59:52.666
He lives through his words...

59:52.667 --> 59:54.542
Like these.

59:56.208 --> 01:00:00.541
It says, "at first,
do what is necessary,

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:03.958
"and then do what is possible,

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:07.416
and suddenly, you will be
doing the impossible."

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:09.708
You see, some people
blame themselves

01:00:09.709 --> 01:00:11.082
for things they cannot do,

01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:15.165
for the disappointment of
others, or their own failings.

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:17.082
But in their distress,

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:21.874
they forget that god does not
expect us to be successful...

01:00:21.875 --> 01:00:24.999
Only faithful.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.708
We must remember this when
even doing the necessary

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:30.040
seems impossible.

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:34.207
Well, but enough
of saints and sinners.

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:37.207
It's very late,
and we both are tired.

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:42.249
We have much work
to do tomorrow to clean up.

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:44.541
But...

01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:47.000
From this sorrow,
some strength will come.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:51.457
Buenas noches, señor stanhope.

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:53.625
Buenas noches, padre.

01:01:14.917 --> 01:01:16.999
What is it?
What's the matter?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.457
What you said last night

01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:20.999
about what's necessary
and what's possible...

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.666
Do you truly believe that?

01:01:22.667 --> 01:01:24.749
Yes, with all my heart.

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:25.999
All right.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.499
Then you better hurry up,
'cause we got work to do.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.959
Come on.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.040
All right, you see this?

01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:35.582
All right,
that's where it started.

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:37.749
The wall cracked,
and the bracket pulled loose.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.124
Now, when that failed,

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:42.332
the load got transferred
there and there and over there.

01:01:42.333 --> 01:01:44.541
And as each one of those failed,
the load doubled somewhere else.

01:01:44.542 --> 01:01:48.416
In engineering, we call it
a catastrophic system failure.

01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:50.290
It's like
when a bridge collapses.

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:51.541
One thing leads to another.

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:53.499
But it is
how we have always done it.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.040
It's the only way
I know how to do it.

01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:57.082
Look, what if I redesign
the system for you

01:01:57.083 --> 01:02:00.249
and separate the load-bearing
part from the controlled part?

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:03.499
That way, if one part fails,
you'll still be able to steer.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.624
Can you do that?

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:06.290
Well, sure.
It's just simple engineering.

01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:08.624
It's just pulleys and levers.
It's not rocket science.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:11.541
The fiesta is tomorrow.
Can you do it in time?

01:02:11.542 --> 01:02:15.000
Hey, if it's necessary,
it's possible.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.207
Let's go. Let's go.
Run.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:30.041
Come, come, everybody.

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:34.958
Señor stanhope
is an engineer from the north,

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:36.749
and he has designed a máquina,

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.749
a much better máquina so
that pepillo may fly in safety,

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.666
but we need your help
to build it.

01:02:41.667 --> 01:02:44.332
Tomorrow is the fiesta,
and we don't have much time.

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:45.708
We have a lot of work to do,

01:02:45.709 --> 01:02:47.666
so I'm gonna need everybody
to work together.

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:50.833
What we have to do
is totally rebuild la máquina.

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:52.165
What's going on?

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:54.416
Juan, can this be welded?

01:02:54.417 --> 01:02:56.040
I don't know.

01:02:56.041 --> 01:02:57.207
I can try.

01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:58.249
All right, thanks.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.040
Everybody,
follow me to the Plaza,

01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:01.999
and I'll show you
what I need you to do, okay?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.874
- Come on.
- Let's go!

01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:06.250
Let's go help!

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.250
Señor.
Yeah?

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.791
You would do that for us?

01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:12.041
How else is pepillo gonna fly?

01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:15.582
Thank you!
Thank you so much.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:16.958
Thank you.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:19.708
Let's go.
Put that bracket up there.

01:03:19.709 --> 01:03:21.542
That's it, Pedro.
That's good.

01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:37.290
Good.

01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:38.958
So, are you basking in the glow?

01:04:38.959 --> 01:04:40.833
I'm telling you,
these people are amazing.

01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:42.416
It would have taken my crew
three days

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:43.708
to do what they did
in eight hours.

01:04:43.709 --> 01:04:45.249
Yeah? Well, it shows you
how much it means to them.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.624
You know, I asked the padre if he
wanted to do another test flight,

01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:49.332
and he said,
"no, it's not necessary."

01:04:49.333 --> 01:04:50.708
So no more test pig?

01:04:50.709 --> 01:04:52.457
Well, the pig
wasn't exactly Chuck Yeager.

01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:53.624
Iseñor Pete!
Iseñor Pete!

01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:54.666
Come quick!

01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:56.124
It's broken!
It's broken!

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:58.624
Well, that was a short bask.

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:00.916
It is no use.

01:05:00.917 --> 01:05:03.374
The metal is too old.
It is impossible to weld.

01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:05.791
Maybe we can use something else.

01:05:05.792 --> 01:05:08.833
I don't know... another part that you
might have, anything. No, it's no good.

01:05:08.834 --> 01:05:12.249
Without that piece, there's
no way the machine can work.

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.040
Señor Pete, can you fix it?

01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:17.166
Not this time, buddy.
I wish I could.

01:05:18.959 --> 01:05:22.834
There's got to be something here
that we can use, don't you think?

01:05:24.667 --> 01:05:26.833
Señor Pete,
the parts are here...

01:05:26.834 --> 01:05:28.708
The wheel bearing and spindle.

01:05:28.709 --> 01:05:30.708
I told you they would come.

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:32.124
Well, at least
we can fix your car.

01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:33.999
Wait a minute.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.499
The spindle.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.457
If we cut it
and modify it a little bit,

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:41.499
it could replace the piece
that broke.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.958
Yes, but if we cut it, we can't
piece it back together,

01:05:43.959 --> 01:05:46.542
and there's no telling
when we can get a new one.

01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:55.833
I don't care.

01:05:55.834 --> 01:05:57.666
Cut it.
Bend it.

01:05:57.667 --> 01:05:59.541
Tie it in a knot.
Whatever it takes.

01:05:59.542 --> 01:06:01.457
Yes!

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:02.875
Really?

01:06:12.291 --> 01:06:14.834
What do we do now?

01:06:20.208 --> 01:06:23.416
Why, Pete stanhope...

01:06:23.417 --> 01:06:25.166
You're my hero.

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:44.166
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:47.917 --> 01:06:49.290
A little higher.

01:06:49.291 --> 01:06:50.916
Keep going.

01:06:50.917 --> 01:06:52.416
Push, push, push.

01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:53.499
Good. Right there.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.500
Right there.
Right there.

01:06:54.501 --> 01:06:56.457
Let's see.
Let's go.

01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:57.874
Let's go.
Let's go, kids.

01:06:57.875 --> 01:06:58.875
Hey, Juan.

01:07:00.792 --> 01:07:01.958
Hey, Pete.

01:07:01.959 --> 01:07:03.958
Hey. They left this
for me to wear.

01:07:03.959 --> 01:07:06.249
Is this right, or
is someone playing a joke on me?

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.457
No, that's perfect. That's perfect.
I'm glad to see you.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:10.749
I really wanted to thank you for
everything you've done for us,

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.040
especially pepillo.

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:14.624
I've never seen him so happy
and smiling all the time.

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:15.958
Yeah, no problem.

01:07:15.959 --> 01:07:17.582
We're gonna see you tonight
at the fiesta, right?

01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:19.124
I'm sorry.
We're not gonna make it tonight.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:20.874
Pepillo's
in too much pain today.

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:23.499
Yeah, it's been
a rough couple days on him.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.708
He's been working hard.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:27.124
You know, he's always
in constant pain.

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:30.290
He's trying to hide it
from everybody else, even me.

01:07:30.291 --> 01:07:33.207
All he really wants is to be
treated like a normal kid.

01:07:33.208 --> 01:07:34.457
Yeah, he's a good boy.

01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:36.457
I wish I had half his energy
and his zest for life.

01:07:36.458 --> 01:07:37.749
Tell me about it.

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.374
You know, to me,
he's a constant reminder

01:07:39.375 --> 01:07:40.791
of what life
is really all about.

01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:43.040
You know, if you've had a good
day with the ones you love,

01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:44.624
you really don't need
anything more.

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:47.708
Everything else
just confuses matters.

01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:49.833
Is it really that simple?

01:07:49.834 --> 01:07:54.250
You know, as shocking as it
sounds, I really think it is.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.833
I wouldn't miss this
for anything.

01:08:02.834 --> 01:08:04.666
I mean, just think...
We could have been stuck

01:08:04.667 --> 01:08:06.165
in some boring
little resort town

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:07.416
like all the other tourists,

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:11.833
but instead, here, we're
like... Like locals, right?

01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:13.583
Yeah, sure.

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:16.165
My gosh!

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:18.624
The town is beautiful!

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:21.999
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Real beautiful.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.249
You know, you're awfully down

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:24.666
for someone
who just saved the day.

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.999
Are you worried
about the wires or something?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.957
No.
No, it's not that.

01:08:28.959 --> 01:08:30.624
It's...

01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:31.707
It's pepillo.

01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:33.916
Why?

01:08:33.917 --> 01:08:36.124
He's thrilled.
You should be, too.

01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:39.249
I mean, because of you,
he gets to fly.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:41.165
No, it's more than that.

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:43.207
What do you mean?

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:45.582
He, um...

01:08:45.582 --> 01:08:48.249
He told me a secret...

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:51.040
A secret I'm not supposed
to tell anybody else.

01:08:51.041 --> 01:08:53.374
Well, do wives qualify
as "anybody else"?

01:08:53.375 --> 01:08:57.416
He believes that San Judas tadeo

01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:59.165
came to him in a dream

01:08:59.166 --> 01:09:02.749
and told him that
the first miracle of dommatina

01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:03.916
would happen again.

01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:06.207
Only this time,
it would happen with him.

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:10.290
What... he thinks his leg is
magically going to cure itself?

01:09:10.291 --> 01:09:11.582
That's what he said...

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.832
That he would fly
to the base of the statue

01:09:13.834 --> 01:09:16.666
and San Judas tadeo
would heal him.

01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:17.874
My gosh.

01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:20.416
That's why he thinks
the Saint lied to him

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:21.917
when the machine broke...

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:25.499
and why you didn't want
to be the one to fix it.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.749
It would take another year
for him to get to fly,

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.707
and hopefully, by then,
he'd be too old.

01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:32.332
To believe in miracles.

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:34.916
If he flies around the Plaza

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:38.332
and lands at the feet
of San Judas tadeo

01:09:38.332 --> 01:09:40.709
and nothing has changed...

01:09:43.792 --> 01:09:45.792
How do you explain that
to a kid?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.332
I don't know.

01:09:49.332 --> 01:09:51.082
Neither do I.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.708
So, are you ready?

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.082
As ready as I'll ever be.

01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:17.958
You sure about this?
Positive, señor.

01:10:17.959 --> 01:10:19.332
Sure about what?

01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:21.082
What's the matter?
Where you going?

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:23.374
Well, it appears I've been drafted
into the service of the king.

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:25.332
The king?
What king?

01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:27.999
King Philip III...

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.583
Of Spain.

01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:32.916
That king.

01:10:32.917 --> 01:10:34.332
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:35.916
You guys are absolutely sure
no one else could do this?

01:10:35.917 --> 01:10:37.165
No one else can do it...
Just you.

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:38.624
Well, what about Juan?
Why can't he do it?

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:39.999
Because nobody
wants to see Juan.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.582
You are the one
that saved the fiesta,

01:10:41.583 --> 01:10:43.332
so you are the one
that people want to see.

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:46.499
Come on.
Let's go.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.207
I'm going to see it, right?

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:52.499
Yeah.
Where?

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.792
Coming here, right?

01:10:59.667 --> 01:11:01.291
Yeah, right?

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.666
Where on earth is Pete?

01:11:03.667 --> 01:11:05.457
The parade's about to begin.
He's gonna miss it.

01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:07.999
I wouldn't worry about it.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.124
He'll be here.

01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:11.834
Shh! Shh! Shh!

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:43.625
Wow.

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:04.416
Hey, sailor.

01:12:04.417 --> 01:12:06.457
Can you spare
a few gold doubloons, perhaps?

01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:08.582
Yeah. Very funny.

01:12:08.583 --> 01:12:11.082
Well, I think
you look very dashing.

01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:13.791
If I had to have my country
conquered by any conquistador,

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:14.833
it would be you.

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:16.290
Well, thank you.

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:18.916
It's funny... one minute, i'm
a stranded American tourist,

01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:20.916
and the next minute,
I am Juan cabrillo.

01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:23.082
If they could
only see this at home.

01:12:23.083 --> 01:12:24.416
They'd never believe it.

01:12:24.417 --> 01:12:25.541
I don't blame them.

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:27.022
I'm here,
and I can hardly believe it.

01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.458
Thank you, father.

01:12:41.417 --> 01:12:43.332
Well, here goes nothing.

01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:45.124
Okay, you're starting
to make me nervous.

01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:46.290
This is gonna work, isn't it?

01:12:46.291 --> 01:12:47.791
Guaranteed.
Really?

01:12:47.792 --> 01:12:49.999
Yeah, 60,000 miles or 5 years...

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.207
Whichever comes first.

01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:53.792
It's not funny.

01:12:54.959 --> 01:12:59.457
Welcome to the fiesta
of San Judas tadeo.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:02.874
Today, we celebrate
the miracle of dommatina

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:05.874
when, many years ago,
this blessed Saint

01:13:05.875 --> 01:13:09.958
came to our village to repay
a child his kindness

01:13:09.959 --> 01:13:13.624
by transforming
a crippled child into a dove.

01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:17.874
And when he transformed him
back, the child could walk.

01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:21.124
So this year,
as in years gone by,

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:25.165
we celebrate this miracle with
the flight of one special child

01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:27.499
to the feet of San Judas tadeo.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:31.582
This year, our special dove
is little pepillo.

01:13:31.583 --> 01:13:33.249
Ipepillo! Ipepillo! Ipepillo!

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:36.916
His spirit's so light, he could
almost fly without our help.

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:39.999
So let us bow our heads
and pray.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.624
In the name of the father...

01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:44.666
So... donna,
I've been thinking.

01:13:44.667 --> 01:13:49.666
Um, I've been really selfish
about the whole baby thing.

01:13:49.667 --> 01:13:51.499
It just kind of...

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.958
It just kind of felt to me
that getting pregnant to you

01:13:54.959 --> 01:13:57.165
was the most important thing
in the world...

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.666
Even more important than us.

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.541
Pete, listen... no, no, no.
No, no. Just listen.

01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:03.708
What I'm saying is...

01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:07.290
If you really want to try again,

01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:08.708
I think we should.

01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:09.874
What about the money?

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:12.708
We've got the money.

01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:15.040
Do you remember that savings
account you made me start

01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:18.082
before you'd even
go out with me?

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:20.124
Yeah.
Yes, I remember.

01:14:20.125 --> 01:14:24.374
Well, I never closed it,
even after we got married.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:26.749
I always thought I'd need
a little extra cash

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.708
if the right opportunity
came along,

01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:31.332
and, well, there's
just enough money in there

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.624
to get us started.

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:35.917
If we need some more,
then we'll find it.

01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:39.792
You'd do that?

01:14:43.542 --> 01:14:46.791
He's quite a kid...
Totally fearless.

01:14:46.792 --> 01:14:49.582
You know, Pete,
I have been thinking, too,

01:14:49.583 --> 01:14:54.666
and instead of us spending money
to try and make a new kid,

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:57.290
maybe we should spend it
on one that we already know.

01:14:57.291 --> 01:14:58.791
So long ago.

01:14:58.792 --> 01:15:00.582
Pepillo?

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:02.249
Yeah, we could take him and Juan
to the states,

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:03.457
get him to see
a real specialist.

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:06.582
You would do that?

01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:09.082
But I thought having a baby
was everything.

01:15:09.083 --> 01:15:12.249
Having a baby
would be wonderful,

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:14.999
just truly wonderful.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.582
But it's not everything.

01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.040
The most important thing

01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:20.958
is us being there
for each other.

01:15:20.959 --> 01:15:23.999
You know, if all the ropes
and cables and wires

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.958
were to come crashing down,

01:15:25.959 --> 01:15:27.958
we would be there for each other

01:15:27.959 --> 01:15:31.625
to help string them
back up again.

01:15:35.625 --> 01:15:38.207
But just because we help pepillo

01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:41.332
doesn't mean we can't still try
to have a kid of our own.

01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:44.874
And if that doesn't work,
we could always adopt.

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:47.458
You could love a child
that wasn't your own?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.834
Haven't you noticed?

01:15:57.959 --> 01:16:00.916
Amén.

01:16:00.917 --> 01:16:04.667
And now our flying boy, pepillo.

01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:07.667
Hey!

01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:10.749
Fantastic!

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:12.834
It's gonna be okay.
I promise.

01:16:15.375 --> 01:16:16.499
Bueno.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.582
It is finally your turn,
my little pepillo.

01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:19.708
Are you ready?

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:20.749
Sí, padre.

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:22.875
Bueno. Bueno.

01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:28.000
- Be careful.
- That's it.

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:31.249
Go ahead.

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:33.541
Okay.

01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:35.290
Go to the edge.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.708
Bueno.

01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:40.959
People of dommatina,
we present pepillo!

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.916
Let's have
a big hand for him here.

01:16:45.917 --> 01:16:49.291
Looking good, pepillo!

01:16:50.583 --> 01:16:54.791
It's the flying boy, pepillo!

01:16:54.792 --> 01:16:56.207
Go, go, go!

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:57.875
Whoo!

01:16:59.542 --> 01:17:01.290
Watch me fly, Mr. Pete!

01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:02.666
Ifly, pepillo!

01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:03.749
Watch me!

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:05.999
Nice job.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.040
Why, thank you.

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:09.958
I do have an engineering degree,
after all.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.582
The dove!
The dove!

01:17:12.583 --> 01:17:14.708
Whoa!

01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:15.874
Whoa!

01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:17.082
Ipepillo!

01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:19.040
Look, I'm flying!

01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:21.291
You sure are.

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.500
Whoa!

01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:34.041
Higher!
Higher, padre!

01:17:37.083 --> 01:17:38.125
Higher.

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:44.208
Good one, pepillo!

01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:47.916
Whoa! Whoo!

01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:50.249
Not very high.
If it gets high, I get nervous.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.624
Yes!
Faster, padre!

01:17:52.625 --> 01:17:54.457
Whoo!

01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:56.250
Yes!
Okay.

01:17:58.792 --> 01:18:00.375
Yes!

01:18:01.834 --> 01:18:04.417
Let's go, padre!
Let's go!

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.082
Yes! Yes!

01:18:11.083 --> 01:18:13.207
Father Arturo.

01:18:13.208 --> 01:18:15.624
Okay, pepillo.
That's enough, pepillo.

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:16.916
Enough, padre.

01:18:16.917 --> 01:18:19.290
I don't want to get down.
I want to fly.

01:18:19.291 --> 01:18:21.374
Look, you can't
even reach me now.

01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:22.666
Faster!

01:18:22.667 --> 01:18:23.999
No, no, no.
It's time to come in.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.124
Come on, now.

01:18:25.125 --> 01:18:27.249
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No. No.

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:29.000
No, no, no, no, no.
Pepillo!

01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:31.124
Whoa! Ha! Ha!

01:18:31.125 --> 01:18:32.374
He should stop.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.124
Come on!

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:36.124
He's going very fast,
Juan. Say something.

01:18:36.125 --> 01:18:38.916
Pepillo, stop
moving around like that.

01:18:38.917 --> 01:18:40.792
Pepillo, hey.

01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:43.625
Padre.

01:18:45.041 --> 01:18:46.708
Pepillo!
Come on.

01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:48.541
Pepillo, you have
to stop doing that!

01:18:48.542 --> 01:18:49.791
Don't move around like that.

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:52.040
Hang on to it, padre.

01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:53.458
Father, we got to bring him in.

01:18:57.959 --> 01:18:59.917
Are you okay?!
Are you okay?

01:19:01.834 --> 01:19:03.417
Pepillo!

01:19:04.834 --> 01:19:06.083
Pepillo!

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.374
Pepillo. Shh.

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:12.499
Quick. Go get
the doctor.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.165
No, no, no, no.
I will take him.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.916
No, no, don't move him.
It can make it worse.

01:19:17.917 --> 01:19:19.833
Pepillo.

01:19:19.834 --> 01:19:22.249
Pepillo.

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:23.583
Pepillo, son.

01:19:28.375 --> 01:19:30.290
I think he's coming to.

01:19:30.291 --> 01:19:32.333
San Judas tadeo.

01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:35.542
Pepillo.

01:19:37.458 --> 01:19:38.541
Take it easy.

01:19:38.542 --> 01:19:40.040
Pepillo, can you hear us?

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.874
Pepillo, baby.

01:19:41.875 --> 01:19:42.959
You okay?

01:19:44.542 --> 01:19:45.709
You okay?

01:19:47.041 --> 01:19:49.624
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:19:49.625 --> 01:19:51.708
I want to walk.
What?

01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:53.542
I want to walk.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.166
Does it hurt?
No, I'm good.

01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:12.667
Padre.

01:20:15.875 --> 01:20:17.624
You can move.

01:20:17.625 --> 01:20:20.833
Does it hurt?
No, it's not hurting.

01:20:20.834 --> 01:20:22.124
Look at that!

01:20:22.125 --> 01:20:23.917
It's a miracle!

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:34.417
Señor Pete, remember the dream?

01:20:39.041 --> 01:20:42.082
He's walking.

01:20:42.083 --> 01:20:44.125
Juan, look.

01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:48.458
Look!
He's walking!

01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:56.625
This is incredible.
If I hadn't seen it.

01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:04.040
Gracias, San Judas tadeo.

01:21:04.041 --> 01:21:06.000
Thank you very much.

01:21:07.834 --> 01:21:11.708
Did you just see what I saw?

01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:15.499
I am not sure.
I think so.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.791
He flew.

01:21:16.792 --> 01:21:18.124
He landed.

01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.249
Yeah.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.457
And now he's walking,

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:23.833
just like San Judas tadeo
told him he would.

01:21:23.834 --> 01:21:26.582
Do you think
we just witnessed a real...

01:21:26.583 --> 01:21:27.708
Miracle?
Yeah.

01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:29.874
No. No chance.

01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:34.249
There's got to be some sort
of logical explanation,

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:36.958
like, um...

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:40.416
Like when he landed, he must
have, fixed his spine.

01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:43.749
Whatever was out of place
got knocked back into place.

01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:46.874
Like one of those stories when someone gets
bumped in the head and they lose their memory,

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:49.332
and then they bump it again,
and they get their memory back, right?

01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:50.499
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.499
Completely logical.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.833
Or maybe it was just the power
of positive thinking.

01:21:56.834 --> 01:21:58.207
You think?

01:21:58.208 --> 01:22:02.040
Yeah, you know, when someone
wants something so very much,

01:22:02.041 --> 01:22:04.166
they make it happen.

01:22:07.792 --> 01:22:09.916
Or maybe...

01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:13.082
Just maybe...

01:22:13.083 --> 01:22:17.499
We witnessed
an honest-to-goodness miracle,

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.125
the miracle of dommatina.

01:22:22.458 --> 01:22:25.457
Pepillo! Pepillo!

01:22:25.458 --> 01:22:28.541
Pepillo! Pepillo!

01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:31.000
Pepillo! Pepillo!

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.709
Pepillo!

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.708
Good morning.

01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:56.792
Have I told you lately
how beautiful you are?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.040
That's sweet.

01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:03.541
You're welcome.

01:23:03.542 --> 01:23:05.999
You're very beautiful.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.916
Pepillo told me I should
tell you that every day,

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.666
so I'm getting an early start...

01:23:11.667 --> 01:23:13.291
Trying to make up for lost time.

01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:20.333
I'll get it this time.

01:23:29.041 --> 01:23:30.457
Buenos días, pepillo.

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:31.916
Señorita, the bus...

01:23:31.917 --> 01:23:34.125
If you want a ride,
you must hurry.

01:23:39.583 --> 01:23:42.624
Honey...

01:23:42.625 --> 01:23:44.499
The bus is here.
It's time to go.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.834
Feels like we just got here.

01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:51.457
Well, I guess that's about it.

01:23:51.458 --> 01:23:53.124
We better get going if we want

01:23:53.125 --> 01:23:55.082
to get to the car-rental place
before it closes.

01:23:55.083 --> 01:23:56.958
I want to thank you.

01:23:56.959 --> 01:23:58.124
Both of you.

01:23:58.125 --> 01:24:00.249
Without your help, there
would have been no miracle.

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:03.708
Well, we could say the same
about dommatina.

01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:05.582
Well, then, we're all blessed.

01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:06.791
Go with god.
Gracias.

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:08.416
Thank you, padre.

01:24:08.417 --> 01:24:10.749
Hey, I'll be back in a week
to pick up the car,

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.833
and then you and pepillo
will drive home with me.

01:24:12.834 --> 01:24:14.457
Hey, we want to take you
to a good orthopedist

01:24:14.458 --> 01:24:16.791
and make sure your miracle
stays a miracle, okay?

01:24:16.792 --> 01:24:17.999
Okay, señor Pete.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.416
Thanks for everything, guys.

01:24:19.417 --> 01:24:21.582
Gracias, señor.
And you have to come, too.

01:24:21.583 --> 01:24:24.290
We have some shopping to do
for your wedding. My gosh.

01:24:24.291 --> 01:24:26.499
You have a good man.

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.791
You do.

01:24:27.792 --> 01:24:31.165
Don't let him go,
even if he becomes El torito.

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:33.332
I won't.
I promise... not ever.

01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:34.416
Okay.

01:24:34.417 --> 01:24:35.999
Bye.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.166
Bye.

01:24:52.208 --> 01:24:53.750
Bye!

01:24:59.959 --> 01:25:01.624
It's a lot of paperwork.

01:25:01.625 --> 01:25:04.999
They sure don't make it easy
to adopt a child, do they?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.583
I know we're gonna be just fine.

01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:12.749
You okay?

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:13.999
Yeah.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.749
That was just the pepperoni,
I think.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:16.916
We have antacid, don't we?

01:25:16.917 --> 01:25:18.833
Yeah. There should be some
in the medicine cabinet.

01:25:18.834 --> 01:25:20.208
Okay.

01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:18.666
Pete.

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:21.208
Yeah?

01:26:27.333 --> 01:26:29.250
You okay?

01:26:31.166 --> 01:26:33.458
I'm fine.

01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:38.291
I-I'm more than fine.

01:26:41.917 --> 01:26:43.874
You're kidding.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:45.833
You're pregnant?

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:47.124
No.

01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:49.958
Yes. No, I'm not kidding.

01:26:49.959 --> 01:26:52.457
Yes, I'm pregnant.
Yes!

01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:53.916
Yes!

01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:56.709
Yes, I am.

01:26:58.917 --> 01:27:00.959
Yes!
