{\an8}MORE STUFFED PEPPERS.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.092
{\an8}- VINNY, YOU ARE LUCKY
TO HAVE A MOTHER LIKE THIS.

{\an8}- THIS IS
HIS FAVORITE CAKE, BUT...

07:54.140 --> 07:55.224
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT? IT ACTUALLY
HELD UP PRETTY GOOD.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.392
{\an8}- VINNY'S MOM BEING AROUND

07:56.475 --> 07:59.061
{\an8}DEFINITELY GIVES YOU
THAT HOME FEELING.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.062
{\an8}SHE BRINGS, LIKE, ONE PIECE
OF CLOTHING FOR HERSELF

08:00.146 --> 08:01.230
{\an8}FOR A WEEK.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.065
{\an8}MEANWHILE,
SHE'S BRINGING VINNY T-SHIRTS,

08:03.149 --> 08:05.526

08:16.662 --> 08:17.580
{\an8}- HI, HONEY.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.207
{\an8}- ANGELINA SLEPT
WITH VINNY LAST NIGHT,

08:19.290 --> 08:20.833
{\an8}AND WHEN I WALK OUT
INTO THE KITCHEN, THERE'S JOSE.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.419
{\an8}I JUST WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE
[bleep] IS THIS KID DOING HERE?"

08:23.502 --> 08:25.838
{\an8}- YOU HAVE A GOOD SON.
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

08:25.922 --> 08:26.923

{\an8}- I APPRECIATE THAT.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.267
{\an8}- IN THE BACK OF MY MIND,

08:38.351 --> 08:40.770
{\an8}I'M LIKE,
"SHE DID NOT TELL HIM YET."

08:40.852 --> 08:42.897
{\an8}THE GUY HAS TAKEN HER
ON A NUMBER OF DATES,

08:42.980 --> 08:45.483
{\an8}AND YOU'RE GONNA DISRESPECT
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT

08:45.566 --> 08:48.027
{\an8}AND BANG SOMEBODY
ONE DAY LATER?

08:48.110 --> 08:51.239
{\an8}THIS IS NOT RIGHT, YOU KNOW?
LIKE, YOU'RE GETTING PLAYED OUT.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.449
{\an8}I THINK SHE SHOULD MAN UP
AND TELL JOSE.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.910
{\an8}HE SHOULD KNOW THIS.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.122
{\an8}- I'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT ME TO...

09:00.206 --> 09:02.375

{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO?
- WHAT?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.633
{\an8}BREAD THE CHICKEN CUTLETS.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.094
{\an8}- OH, OH, MY BUDDY.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.512
{\an8}- HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
FORGET ABOUT IT.

09:14.595 --> 09:15.972
{\an8}- I KNOW NINO'S HERE.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.515
{\an8}- HOW YOU DOING?

09:17.598 --> 09:20.184
{\an8}HAVING ALL THESE CRAZY ITALIANS
IN ONE HOUSE TOGETHER

09:20.268 --> 09:21.686
{\an8}FOR, LIKE--IT FEELS LIKE
SUNDAY DINNER TO ME.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.397

09:24.480 --> 09:26.274
{\an8}- AND I HAVE THE OVEN ON--

09:26.357 --> 09:27.525
{\an8}- I HAVE THIS HOT

09:27.608 --> 09:30.653
{\an8}BUT SHE'S HOT ENOUGH
TO TAKE ON A DATE.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.028
{\an8}- ANGELINA?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.947
{\an8}- YES?

09:33.030 --> 09:34.282
{\an8}- THE BREAD CRUMBS.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.908
{\an8}- IT'S JUST A LOT
OF PEOPLE YELLING

09:35.992 --> 09:37.618
{\an8}AND TALKING
WITH THEIR HANDS.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.578
{\an8}IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO IT,
IT COULD BE A LOT TO HANDLE.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.830
{\an8}WHERE'S THE CANE?
CAN I USE THE CANE?

09:40.913 --> 09:44.500
{\an8}- IT'S LIKE A BROAD--
YOU COULD BORROW IT.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.918
{\an8}YOU GOTTA BRING IT BACK, EH?

09:46.002 --> 09:49.005
{\an8}- UNCLE NINO IS AN O.G.,
AN ORIGINAL GUIDO.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.256
{\an8}- LOOK AT THAT COLOR, HUH?

09:50.339 --> 09:51.841

09:56.095 --> 09:58.347
{\an8}SCARY DELICIOUS.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.724
{\an8}- YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
MY UNCLE NINO WHEN HE TALKS,

09:59.807 --> 10:02.351
{\an8}BUT, YOU KNOW,
FIVE SECONDS LATER,

10:02.435 --> 10:03.352
{\an8}YOU CATCH, LIKE, THE LAST
TWO WORDS OF WHAT HE'S SAYING,

10:03.436 --> 10:05.646
{\an8}AND THEN LIKE
IT ALL SINKS IN.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.189
{\an8}- HE SAYS,
"WHERE YOU GOING?"

10:07.273 --> 10:08.441
{\an8}I SAID, "OH, GET IN THE CAB.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.026
{\an8}I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
GO AROUND THE CORNER."

10:10.109 --> 10:11.694
{\an8}- [imitating Nino muttering]

10:11.777 --> 10:14.030
{\an8}- OH, MIKEY SANITATION!

HEY, SANITATION, SANITATION.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.992
{\an8}- OH! MY, LOOK, I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

{\an8}- [imitating Nino] RONNIE,
RONNIE, LISTEN, RONNIE, RONNIE.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.331
{\an8}- HE SAYS,
"YOU STILL NEED THE CAR?"

10:23.414 --> 10:25.041
{\an8}"I DON'T NEED THE [bleep]!
KEEP THE [bleep] CAR."

10:25.124 --> 10:26.834
{\an8}- I'M LIKE,
"WHAT THE [bleep], UNCLE NINO?"

10:26.917 --> 10:28.502
{\an8}[bleep].

10:28.586 --> 10:29.628
{\an8}- LET'S MAKE A TOAST
TO MY NEW FAMILY.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.340

GOOD LUCK.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.559
{\an8}all:
<i>SALUTE.</i>

10:43.642 --> 10:45.561

10:45.644 --> 10:47.355
{\an8}MWAH!

10:47.438 --> 10:49.815
{\an8}- I AM EXTREMELY EXCITED

10:49.899 --> 10:51.609
{\an8}FOR A HOME-COOKED MEAL
FROM VINNY'S MOM

10:51.692 --> 10:55.196
{\an8}AND JUST TO HAVE
FAMILY SURROUNDING ME.

10:55.279 --> 10:58.240
{\an8}- WE HAD THAT MEAL IN COURSES.
IT STARTED OFF WITH THE PASTA.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.534
{\an8}- DOES ANYBODY
NEED ANYTHING ELSE?

11:00.618 --> 11:01.827
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.580
{\an8}- THAT WAS A MEAL ON ITS OWN.

11:04.663 --> 11:06.582
{\an8}- AND, THEN, YOU KNOW,
YOU TAKE A BREAK.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.377
{\an8}YOU DIGEST THE PASTA.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.836
{\an8}- YOU RELAX,
YOU KNOW, LET IT SEEP IN

11:10.920 --> 11:14.924
{\an8}WHILE MY MOM
IS PREPARING THE NEXT COURSE.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.008
{\an8}- ROUND TWO.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.344
{\an8}- THAT WAS WHEN WE HAD
THE SAUSAGE AND PEPPERS.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.054
{\an8}- MOUNDS OF CUTLETS.
- THE ANTIPASTO.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.389
{\an8}- THEN YOUR MEATS.
- THEN THE BROCCOLI RABE.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.432
{\an8}- YOU JUST KEEP GETTING COURSE
AFTER COURSE AFTER COURSE.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.267
{\an8}- OLIVES,
RED PEPPERS, THE BREAD,

11:25.351 --> 11:28.104
{\an8}THE DRY SAUSAGE.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.815
{\an8}OH, MY GOD.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.734
{\an8}- THEN YOU TAKE A BREAK.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.822
{\an8}- YOU KNOW,
AND THEN THERE'S DESSERT.

11:37.905 --> 11:38.781
{\an8}AND WE GOT MILK,
AND WE GOT YODELS.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.158
{\an8}THAT'S THE WAY
ITALIANS COOK.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.410
{\an8}- [sighs]

{\an8}AND JWOWW HASN'T
EVEN BEEN IN THE HOT TUB

12:05.182 --> 12:06.308
{\an8}SINCE SHE'S BEEN HERE.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.560
{\an8}MY UNCLE NINO
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE

12:07.643 --> 12:09.395
{\an8}THE HIGHEST STANDARDS
IN THE WORLD,

12:09.478 --> 12:11.105
{\an8}SO THESE GIRLS
ARE LOOKING LIKE SUPERMODELS

12:11.188 --> 12:11.647
{\an8}TO HIM RIGHT NOW.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.732

A REALLY CREEPY SCENE RIGHT NOW.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.779
{\an8}- AAH!
[all cheering]

12:22.074 --> 12:24.577
{\an8}- PARADISE--
I'M IN HEAVEN.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.078
{\an8}I'M IN HEAVEN.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.830
{\an8}I WENT TO THE DOCTOR. HE TOLD
ME, "YOU GOT TO STOP DRINKING,

12:27.913 --> 12:28.914
{\an8}STOP DOING DRUGS,
STOP HAVING SEX."

12:28.998 --> 12:31.834
{\an8}KNOW WHAT I DID?
I SWITCHED [bleep] DOCTORS.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.085

12:43.888 --> 12:45.806
{\an8}AND, LIKE,
SMACKS IT IN MY FACE.

12:49.727 --> 12:53.189
{\an8}AT THIS POINT, I WANNA [bleep]
THROW MY GLASS AT HER FACE,

12:53.272 --> 12:55.024
{\an8}BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO START A FIGHT

12:55.107 --> 12:56.358
{\an8}IN FRONT OF THE FAMILY.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.818
{\an8}YOU [bleep]
THREW THE BALL AT ME.

12:57.902 --> 12:58.736

{\an8}WHOA!

13:07.953 --> 13:10.331
{\an8}- I REALLY JUST WANT
THE FAMILY TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW,

13:10.414 --> 13:11.332
{\an8}SO I CAN KILL HER.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.917

13:22.343 --> 13:24.887
{\an8}- VINNY WAS TRYING
TO ROB MY LITTLE CHICK,

13:24.970 --> 13:26.388
{\an8}BUT GUESS WHAT.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.140
{\an8}SHE'S HOOKING UP
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.267
{\an8}- IF HE COMES OUT,
CAN YOU PLEASE NOT SAY ANYTHING?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.936
{\an8}- WHAT, THAT YOU BANGED
[bleep] VINNY?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.729
{\an8}- IF ANYBODY
WOULD TELL JOSE SOMETHING,

13:33.812 --> 13:34.939
{\an8}IT WOULD BE MIKE.

13:35.022 --> 13:35.981
{\an8}THAT'S [bleep] UP.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.135
{\an8}- SEE YOU TOMORROW, VINNY.

{\an8}- IF MY MOM WASN'T THERE

14:08.347 --> 14:09.765
{\an8}WHEN ANGELINA THREW
THE BALL AT SNOOKI'S FACE,

14:09.848 --> 14:11.433
