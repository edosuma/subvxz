WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:02.749
ZANE: Previously on Eureka...

00:02.878 --> 00:05.790
Behold the world's
first wormhole FTL.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.002
I'm here to evaluate
the FTL's potential

00:09.134 --> 00:10.214
before the grant
becomes final.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.254
What grant?

00:11.386 --> 00:13.377
The twenty billion dollars
you're getting
to build a spacecraft

00:13.514 --> 00:14.629
capable of reaching Titan.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.012
It's not like
we went through
a wormhole

00:16.141 --> 00:17.381
and got stuck in 1947.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.008
What do you want
from me, Zane?

00:19.728 --> 00:20.968
I want to know
what we were.

00:23.065 --> 00:23.895
Hello, Allison.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.233
BEVERLY: You're about
to have quite an adventure.

00:33.367 --> 00:38.578
(FARGO READING)

00:38.580 --> 00:39.911
(FARGO READING)

00:40.958 --> 00:43.665
Global Dynamics is home
to the greatest minds
on the planet,

00:43.794 --> 00:45.375
but for a mission
like the Astraeus,

00:45.504 --> 00:47.119
we're looking
for the best of the best.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.871
Are you up to
the challenge?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.668
Oh, look, there's
Dr. Holly Marten,

00:50.926 --> 00:52.962
foremost authority
on launch vehicle design.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.964
And let's not
forget Titan.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.338
So, if a six-month
scientific sojourn

00:57.474 --> 00:58.805
with 20 of the
world's greatest minds

00:58.934 --> 01:00.799
sounds like the getaway
of a lifetime,

01:00.936 --> 01:02.722
then submit your
application today.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.264
Time's running out.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.639
Global Dynamics
wants you!

01:09.236 --> 01:10.897
Dr. Fargo, hi,

01:11.029 --> 01:12.769
my magnetoplasma
generator is perfect

01:12.906 --> 01:14.066
for the Astraeus
rover on Titan.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.235
Dr. Marten,
l have developed
a chamber

01:16.368 --> 01:19.781
that suspends the
FTL traveler in
a controlled dream state.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.076
Okay, people,
no harassing the
VIPs, okay?

01:23.625 --> 01:25.161
I'm extremely sorry.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.955
They've all got
space fever.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.793
It's really
very exciting.
Please.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.162
And anxiety provoking.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.130
I do not...
Do not
care for crowds.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.633
Well, lwill do
my best to keep
the lines at bay.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.842
You, sit.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.212
Eat. Now!

01:39.891 --> 01:40.801
(EXHALES)

01:40.934 --> 01:42.265
Sorry.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.181
So, Holly,

01:45.939 --> 01:48.646
given your discomfort
with humans,

01:49.151 --> 01:53.019
I'd be perfectly happy
to take the lead during
the interview process.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.982
That's very thoughtful,
Dr. Fargo,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.696
but I will be
able to manage.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.190
How many applicants
do we have?

01:58.327 --> 02:03.117
Three hundred and eighty-seven
that need to be pared down
to a final crew of 20.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.455
Maybe I'll just evaluate
the tech side while you
ask the questions.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.949
Splendid idea!

02:07.085 --> 02:09.417
Dr. Fargo,
looking rather
dapper today.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.790
Parrish, that was a...

02:10.922 --> 02:12.913
The tie you've picked out
almost makes your head
look normal size.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.540
Was more what I expected.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.791
And Dr. Marten,
might I add

02:15.969 --> 02:17.584
you are looking
fetching.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.177
Oh, thank you.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.964
That's probably an attempt
to get on my good side
for your interview.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.386
No, ma'am,
I am merely stating
an empirical fact.

02:25.020 --> 02:25.975
Oh, well, in that case...

02:26.104 --> 02:27.093
What do you want, Parrish?

02:27.230 --> 02:29.312
Oh, it's not
what I want.
It's what you want.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.354
Presenting the latest
in interstellar
molecular gastronomy.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.353
My limacoids
are a nutritionally
perfect food.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.355
They will provide
for every dietary
need on Titan.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.150
Mmm.
Tastes like chicken.
Don't they?

02:41.370 --> 02:42.701
Save it for
the interview.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.539
Come on.
This is a freshly
baked batch.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.208
Bet you can't
eat just one.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.004
Oh, not bad.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.676
Not bad.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.848
What are
limacoids anyway?

03:05.977 --> 03:06.932
Banana slugs.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.347
(GAGGING)

03:11.274 --> 03:12.434
SARAH: Good morning,
Dr. Blake.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.774
Good morning, SARAH.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.109
Good morning, Sheriff.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.697
Wow. Wow,
you look... You...

03:21.368 --> 03:22.983
Thank you.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.860
Mmm. Mmm.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.911
Oh, is it coffee breath?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.873
No, no, I still can't
shake this headache.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.162
Well, maybe you should
have someone
look at it then.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.494
I don't like doctors.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.916
No, I...
And yes,
| see the irony.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.504
What's this?

03:39.970 --> 03:42.757
Oh. Baseball Hall of Fame.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.596
Planning your escape?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.514
Planning our escape.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.769
Okay, so, see,
you, me,

03:50.939 --> 03:52.850
Kev, Jenna,
this summer,

03:52.983 --> 03:54.939
we go and find out
that America's
favorite pastime

03:55.068 --> 03:57.024
doesn't happen
in a lab.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.316
Mmm. And you're
planning this
for all of us?

04:01.283 --> 04:02.898
Uh... Yeah.

04:03.910 --> 04:04.865
ls...

04:05.620 --> 04:07.326
Too soon?
It's...
It's too soon.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.700
I love it.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.952
l was thinking July.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.918
Oh, better
make it August.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.627
The Astraeus mission
interviews start today

04:16.757 --> 04:17.917
and I'm prepping
for the physical exams.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.215
Space.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.083
Uh, competition for that
is going to be fierce.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.840
Yeah, Fargo has us
looking at some new
high-tech security thing.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.133
Has to be seen
to be believed.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.767
SARAH: Good morning, Zane.
Good morning, SARAH.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.805
l'm detecting a change
in your electrolytes
since you arrived last night.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.313
Would you like
a sports drink?

04:32.439 --> 04:34.521
No, thanks, SARAH,
I'm good.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.727
'Sup?

04:37.486 --> 04:38.646
BOTH: 'Sup?

04:38.987 --> 04:39.851
Uh, later.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.115
Not a word.

04:52.959 --> 04:53.823
Don't.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.245
(MUMBLES)

04:58.965 --> 05:00.671
You're early, Lupo.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.793
But I can think of a way
to help pass the time
until the others get here.

05:03.929 --> 05:04.793
Take a seat.

05:04.930 --> 05:08.013
I am sorry, Zane,
but last night was it.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.723
I thought
the night before was it.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.093
And the night
before that.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.265
No?

05:17.859 --> 05:21.898
Oh. I could come back
if you need
a minute or longer.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.812
It's fine, Carter.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.735
Okay, people,
l have interviews
starting in five minutes,

05:25.867 --> 05:27.903
so let's get the show
on the road.
Okay.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.869
Uh, the need for
heightened security
around the Astraeus mission

05:30.997 --> 05:34.990
requires the most advanced
law enforcement technology
Global Dynamics can offer.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.208
Zane, show them
the hardware.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.497
Meet my PALs.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.085
Predictive Algorithm Lenses.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.876
Think of them
as an early warning
security system,

05:42.008 --> 05:43.839
predicting problems
before they happen.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.755
Like a weather
forecast for trouble.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.674
Partly cloudy
with a chance of
global catastrophe.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.426
All right, relax.

05:56.565 --> 05:57.930
Locked and loaded.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.602
Whoa.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.479
What is all that?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.898
The PALs scan and analyze
potential security
and safety risks.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.772
Then they play
the outcomes
in live action,

06:06.908 --> 06:09.024
giving you a variable
time frame for them
to become reality.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.701
Yeah, it's like
having your own
Professor Xavier.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.783
Who's Professor Xavier?

06:13.915 --> 06:16.622
Okay, I'm going to
pretend you didn't
just say that.

06:16.751 --> 06:17.877
Anyway, I designed the PALs

06:18.003 --> 06:19.743
to predict accident
hazards at the workplace,

06:20.046 --> 06:21.752
as well as
behavior assessment
for law enforcement.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.790
Why don't you tell us
what you see, Lupo?

06:24.926 --> 06:27.167
Well, the wiring
in the electroculogram
recorder,

06:27.304 --> 06:29.340
it has
a short circuit,

06:29.472 --> 06:31.463
and it needs
to be fixed.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.974
Wait, I'm getting
something else.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.804
Not something
you like?

06:39.941 --> 06:40.896
No.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.731
Not really.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.943
Calculating every risk
in Eureka is impossible.

06:45.906 --> 06:46.816
Yeah, well...

06:46.948 --> 06:48.484
Not if you have
a big enough hard drive.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.826
Thanks to a few
hundred gallons of thermal
displacement fluid,

06:53.038 --> 06:56.121
my PAL's quantum processor
can handle anything.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.907
So the lenses
can measure
the human factor?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.998
Sure. Heart rate,
perspiration, adrenaline.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.792
They'll actually quantify
physiological response,

07:04.925 --> 07:06.756
emotional states, as well
as physical movements.

07:06.885 --> 07:07.840
All right, Chief,
you're up.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.925
No, I don't like
stuff getting
stuck in my eye.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.922
I like, you know,
sight and instincts.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.843
l'm... I'm a real cop.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.637
Not... Not like...

07:17.687 --> 07:18.722
Real cop?

07:18.897 --> 07:20.182
I'm a real cop.
Seriously?

07:21.358 --> 07:22.473
(SOFTLY) Real cop.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.019
Lupo.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.771
I'm on my way.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.896
Parrish is having, uh,
security code trouble.

07:30.492 --> 07:31.948
You should
join me, Carter.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.068
This may be a job
for a real cop.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.082
You're going
to milk this,
aren't you?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.413
Obviously.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.622
All right, well,
see you later, Lupo.

07:40.752 --> 07:41.787
Don't count on it.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.667
JO: Go ahead and ask.
CARTER: No idea
what you mean.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.381
I had to get it
out of my system...
Yeah.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.875
...with Zane,
just to be sure.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.467
Well, watch it.
There are other
people involved.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.587
Other female people,
like my daughter.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.975
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.933
So it's just
a one-time thing?
Yes!

07:59.104 --> 08:02.813
Except for the other
few times...
Well, this time is it.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.061
How long have you guys
been getting this
out of your system?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.901
Five or
six weeks,
but it's over.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.316
Five weeks?
Now we can move on.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.534
Finally.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.206
What is the problem,
Dr. Parrish?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.326
I can't access
the cooling system.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.669
Someone is messing
with my limacoids

08:26.798 --> 08:28.504
to eliminate me
from the Astraeus mission.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.291
But why?
You're so much fun.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.676
And paranoid.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.014
Nothing wrong with
your security code.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.677
Something must be
jamming the pipe.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.508
Well, then
un-jam it.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.884
Without a fresh supply
of dormancy gel,

08:41.021 --> 08:42.761
my limacoids
will expire.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.353
Oh, well,
we can't have that.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.269
That... That...
I got this.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.990
Watch and learn.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.787
Have at it, friend.

09:03.835 --> 09:04.915
(GASPS)

09:08.923 --> 09:10.049
(CHUCKLING)

09:12.886 --> 09:15.047
You knew this was going
to happen, didn't you?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.140
You're a bad person.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.158
Oh, so cold.

09:39.913 --> 09:40.902
I know.

09:41.039 --> 09:44.748
The limacoid dormancy
gel pulls body heat
for cryosleep,

09:44.876 --> 09:46.741
but your temperature
should stabilize soon.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.994
Okay. And in the meantime?

09:50.131 --> 09:52.122
I'd say try
a hot shower.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.795
Thanks.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.973
Sorry. Was I staring?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.637
Yes.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.759
Oh, I do that
sometimes.

10:04.896 --> 10:05.931
Now it's awkward.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.394
What can I do
for you, Holly?

10:07.649 --> 10:09.981
Oh, it's not
for me, Dr. Blake.
It's for the mission.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.396
l was going over
our long list of candidates

10:12.529 --> 10:14.110
and I noticed
a name was missing.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.945
A pretty prominent one.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.858
You know, yours.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.494
Oh, no,
I'm not applying.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.490
But we're talking
about going into space.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.332
You should be
first in line
given your expertise.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.292
I mean...
You wrote "The Blake."

10:30.880 --> 10:32.336
Pardon?

10:32.465 --> 10:32.920
That's funny.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.586
But, seriously,
your textbook
on space medicine

10:35.718 --> 10:37.754
didn't just
set the standard,
it created it.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.344
This could be
an opportunity to
implement your research.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.926
Well, thank you,

10:43.268 --> 10:47.011
but I don't think that
I'm really in the position
to become a candidate.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.804
Okay, no pressure,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.805
but if you
change your mind,
let me know.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.807
You would be
a huge asset.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.058
Shenﬁ,

10:54.320 --> 10:56.356
I notice you have
a little bit of
limacoid in your hair.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.569
Do you know they
taste like chicken?

10:58.867 --> 10:59.902
I did not.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.316
Okay then.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.825
You wrote a book?

11:10.962 --> 11:12.873
(CHUCKLES) Apparently.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.709
This timeline gets
weirder and weirder,

11:15.884 --> 11:17.920
but there's royalties...

11:22.348 --> 11:23.599
Wait, do you want
to go into space?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.049
What? Uh, no.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.222
Carter, I'm a mom
now and... (CHUCKLING)

11:29.939 --> 11:31.895
Come on, you're not
going to get
rid of me that easily.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.276
Uh, next.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.477
As demonstrated,

11:38.615 --> 11:40.822
my limacoids are clearly
the superior food
for all forms...

11:40.950 --> 11:42.235
FARGO: Next.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.653
I want to conduct
a study

11:43.786 --> 11:45.287
on the impact
of FTL travel

11:45.413 --> 11:46.994
on synaptic response time.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.034
As it relates to
erectile dysfunction.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.499
Wait, there's actually
a risk of that?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.789
The fuel cell in my
magnetoplasma generator

11:53.922 --> 11:56.880
will allow the Astraeus
rover pilot to travel
at safe altitudes

11:57.008 --> 11:58.544
within Titan's
atmosphere.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.086
l have developed
a sleep chamber,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.085
which balances levels
of melatonin and...

12:02.222 --> 12:03.712
FARGO: Thank you. Next.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.349
What? Why?

12:05.475 --> 12:06.715
Oh, I don't know,
Dr. Gregor,

12:06.851 --> 12:09.012
maybe because
your chamber has
a strong possibility

12:09.145 --> 12:11.511
of putting its user
in a level one
GCS coma.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.889
We're going to Titan,
not Neverland.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.310
My projections say yes.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.400
Mine says no. Next.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.899
FARGO: Your designs
are impressive.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.738
The application's
well-considered.
Thank you.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.156
You're through,
Dr. Dillon.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.274
Thank you.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.400
That was a lot

12:26.537 --> 12:27.993
(CLEARS THROAT)
easier than...

12:29.082 --> 12:30.037
Uh...

12:31.125 --> 12:32.535
I'm not finished.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.500
FARGO: Space isn't
for everyone,
Dr. Parrish.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.039
I would know since
I've been there.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.003
This is ludicrous.
Dr. Marten...

12:38.675 --> 12:39.790
I'm afraid we have
to be in agreement,

12:39.926 --> 12:40.961
Dr. Parrish,

12:41.094 --> 12:44.006
and Dr. Fargo seems
surprisingly adamant.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.636
I'm sorry.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.138
This isn't over, Fargo.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.591
Bye now.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.842
Next.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.523
Are you sure about
Dr. Parrish?

12:57.652 --> 13:00.735
Look, Holly,
I know people
and he is bad news.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.520
All right,
well, let's see.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.945
l was the engineering
team leader on six
space shuttle missions.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.113
l have adapted
my immersion
projection system

13:08.246 --> 13:10.578
to prepare the Astraeus
crew for life on Titan.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.530
This simulation was built

13:12.667 --> 13:15.033
from the latest scans
on Titan's surface.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.462
HOLLY: (GASPS) It's beautiful.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.547
lndeed. Although,
at 94 kelvins

13:21.676 --> 13:23.758
I wouldn't exactly
call it a tropical getaway.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.052
Impressive.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.340
You know what
I like about you?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.093
Everything.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.221
We're putting
you through
to the next round.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.219
Thank you.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.143
Twenty-six down,
only 361 more to go.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.358
At this rate, we'll be
through this round
by the end of the week.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.566
I told you
not to worry.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.064
Mmm.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.447
Are you okay?

13:46.909 --> 13:47.898
l have to say,
Dr. Fargo,

13:48.036 --> 13:49.992
that was very
impressive.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.736
Not that I expected
that you wouldn't be,

13:51.873 --> 13:53.204
it's just... Uh,
whatever.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.368
You know what
I'm saying.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.489
Thank you?

13:55.626 --> 13:58.038
And please just
call me Douglas.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.954
I think l was drawn to
space travel just to
get some perspective.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.296
You know?

14:02.425 --> 14:03.505
There's something
comforting about

14:03.634 --> 14:05.215
knowing that
all our human drama

14:05.345 --> 14:08.087
doesn't amount
for a blip
in the universe.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.130
Out there,
it's infinite
possibility.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.971
FARGO: And we're
just a pale blue dot.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.724
Carl Sagan was one
of my heroes.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.101
He died
on my birthday.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.602
It was sad.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.444
So, um, I was wondering
about the possibility

14:25.573 --> 14:27.234
of maybe grabbing a bite
to eat later on?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.447
Sure.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.316
We could start
comparing notes
on the candidates,

14:30.453 --> 14:31.818
dividing them
into groups for
the next phase.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.909
l was thinking
of something

14:33.039 --> 14:33.903
a little more
off the clock,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.496
like, say, dinner.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.160
Oh.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.504
Um, I'd like that,

14:44.384 --> 14:45.749
Douglas.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.591
Why the frown, Frosty?

14:50.723 --> 14:51.838
Uh, Holly's trying
to recruit Allison

14:51.974 --> 14:54.101
to be the medical director
for the mission.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.933
Wow, that is
great for Allison.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.098
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean it's...

14:58.731 --> 15:01.564
lt's six months away
and a billion
miles from here.

15:01.692 --> 15:02.898
I think it's
halfa billion.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.939
Hey, a lot of people
make long distance
relationships work.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.030
Being on another planet
is a little more than
being long distance.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.193
I think
Titan's a moon.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.441
You're missing
the point.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.614
Hang on,
I'm getting
some warnings.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.619
You think your work
is more important
than mine, Dillon?

15:15.748 --> 15:16.828
I don't know!

15:16.958 --> 15:18.994
I'll let you know
when | get to Titan, my boy.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.582
Everybody out!
Everybody out!

15:24.715 --> 15:26.967
Everybody out!
Everybody out!

15:27.427 --> 15:28.542
Dr. Parrish!

15:29.053 --> 15:30.133
JO: Hey!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.045
(GRUNTS)

15:33.808 --> 15:34.843
Uh!

15:34.976 --> 15:36.136
Oh.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.141
What the hell
are you doing

15:41.274 --> 15:44.016
with a combustible element
outside of a secure lab?

15:44.152 --> 15:45.437
My thought exactly.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.105
I got nowhere
with diagrams.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.353
I had to present
the real thing.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.649
Oh, great idea.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.774
Just take this back
to the propulsion lab

15:52.910 --> 15:55.822
before I have you
both redacted.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.992
Fine. Whatever.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.077
Idiot.
Dumbass!

16:03.421 --> 16:04.581
Hmm.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.923
So, you ready to try
on a pair of PALs now?

16:09.719 --> 16:11.004
I think so.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.008
Can I get one lens
tuned to ESPN?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.596
The...
Sure.

16:28.738 --> 16:29.853
Mmm.

16:32.783 --> 16:33.989
You okay?

16:34.118 --> 16:36.029
Oh, yeah, I, um,

16:37.163 --> 16:38.403
just have a migraine.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.952
Ah, well, you know
it's probably
the newfound fame

16:42.084 --> 16:43.039
going to your head.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.285
I've heard about "The Blake."

16:46.589 --> 16:47.624
You know, Henry,

16:47.757 --> 16:52.000
I had planned to expand
my dissertation into a book,

16:52.803 --> 16:55.715
but then Kevin's
father died
and life took a turn.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.681
But you did write
the book, I mean,
in another timeline.

16:58.809 --> 17:02.552
And the Astraeus crew
would be lucky
to have you.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.558
Hey, guys.
Hey.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.601
Am I, uh,
interrupting?

17:06.984 --> 17:09.646
Uh, no, lwasjust
congratulating
our published author

17:09.779 --> 17:10.894
and discussing

17:11.030 --> 17:14.318
a once in a lifetime
opportunity to go to Titan.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.067
You don't want to go?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.903
I mean that's...
That's what you said.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.414
I couldn't leave
what I have here
for six months,

17:23.543 --> 17:25.625
so no, I'm not interested.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.539
But you guys
are in the middle
of something

17:28.673 --> 17:29.958
so I'll, uh,

17:30.091 --> 17:31.581
catch up with you
in a bit.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.093
Okay.
Okay.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.342
Check in
on you later.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.052
Bye.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.429
Allison, look, I...

17:38.558 --> 17:40.173
I mean, I understand.
I don't mean to push.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.134
No, Henry,
I appreciate
your support.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.057
Another time maybe.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.148
Well, that's the point.
This is another time.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.988
So, uh, how are you
liking your new PALs?

17:56.909 --> 17:57.898
I don't know.

17:58.035 --> 17:58.990
I mean, they're
just guessing, right?

17:59.120 --> 18:02.362
It's not like
they're 100% accurate.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.955
Well, they're
pretty damn close.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.165
Hmm.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.958
(CHOKING)

18:14.010 --> 18:15.796
Hey, you seeing this?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.088
Yeah.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.050
Gee!

18:21.183 --> 18:22.719
Ew! Here.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.728
Take smaller bites.

18:24.854 --> 18:25.969
Ah.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.891
First, Fargo
humiliates me

18:28.024 --> 18:30.106
and now you won't
even let me
masticate in peace?

18:32.028 --> 18:34.110
Well, not in public.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.111
It means to chew.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.481
I know.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.776
I am finished
with all of you.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.199
I will be destabilizing
the magnetic sheath

18:44.332 --> 18:46.539
on my nitroglycerin mix,
if anyone cares.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.000
Carter?

18:55.885 --> 18:57.091
You see that
prediction?

19:02.600 --> 19:03.840
Cataclysmic means
bad, right?

19:08.773 --> 19:10.388
JO: A head wound.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.064
What happened
to him?

19:19.992 --> 19:20.902
(GROANS)

19:22.161 --> 19:23.367
(GRUNTS)

19:28.084 --> 19:30.370
What was that, Jo?
I don't know.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.289
But the PALs said
it's 96% certain

19:32.421 --> 19:34.958
it'll happen in the
next couple hours.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.379
The PALs say?

19:36.509 --> 19:37.544
What, are we going
to jump every time

19:37.677 --> 19:39.588
our hugely uncomfortable
contact lenses tell us?

19:39.970 --> 19:41.801
Everything they've predicted
has happened and Zane...

19:41.931 --> 19:44.638
Um, guys,
you're scaring
the customers, so...

19:46.102 --> 19:47.308
Look, I'll tell
Zane what we saw.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.848
He'll be able to isolate
the factors that led
to the prediction.

19:49.980 --> 19:50.765
All right,
I'll talk to Parrish.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.809
He said he was, um...

19:53.109 --> 19:55.646
Destabilizing
some nitroglycerin.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.318
Yeah. Okay.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.525
All right, everybody,
if I can have
your attention please?

20:00.658 --> 20:02.114
Calmly get your
way out of Cafe Diem

20:02.243 --> 20:03.699
and away from
Main Street, please.

20:03.828 --> 20:04.988
Um, why?

20:05.955 --> 20:07.411
No idea.
Just do it.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.575
Oh. Okay.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.914
All right, everybody.
Yeah, thank you.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.907
Sorry, sir.
Yeah, everybody.
Thank you very much.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.622
DR. LEE: You're running
this thing, son?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.707
What are you, 12?

20:19.844 --> 20:20.879
Dr. Lee, is it?

20:21.011 --> 20:25.425
I prefer Generalissimo,
but Dr. Lee will do.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.514
Ah, well, | see
your focus

20:27.643 --> 20:30.350
is experimenting
with the effects
of gamma radiation.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.312
l've produced some
surprising results.

20:33.441 --> 20:37.400
Don't you think
you're just a titch
too old for space travel?

20:37.528 --> 20:39.564
Don't make me
angry, son.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.281
You wouldn't like me

20:41.782 --> 20:43.283
when I'm angry.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.115
Sorry, Generalissimo.

20:45.828 --> 20:46.988
Next.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.364
Hmm.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.951
So, an explosion
outside Cafe Diem?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.949
You see direction,
details, injuries?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.413
Some.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.712
But it happened
really fast.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.420
And I haven't had
a reading from
your PALs since.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.925
Yeah, because since
Carter's PALs went online,

21:03.137 --> 21:04.343
somethi ng's
overtaxi ng
the system.

21:04.805 --> 21:05.794
I just gotta
figure out what.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.046
Well, do it fast.
We don't have much time.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.974
Where have I
heard that before?

21:11.187 --> 21:14.054
Just fix the lenses, Zane,
before someone gets hurt.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.979
Whatever you say, Jo-Jo.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.859
Let me get
this straight,

21:20.988 --> 21:24.572
you are accusing me
of something I might do?

21:26.744 --> 21:28.905
Well, when you...
When you say it
like that, it sounds...

21:29.038 --> 21:30.118
Asinine,

21:30.706 --> 21:31.866
moronic,

21:31.999 --> 21:33.455
slanderous.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.293
Are you having
a seizure?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.295
No, l...

21:42.843 --> 21:44.253
Okay, look,

21:44.887 --> 21:46.798
we have to wear these
predictive contact lenses

21:46.931 --> 21:48.262
and they saw
an explosion coming

21:48.390 --> 21:49.846
when you stormed out
to deal with your
nitroglycerin,

21:49.975 --> 21:51.931
which goes boom, so...

21:52.311 --> 21:53.596
I use a few micrograms

21:53.729 --> 21:56.266
to increase oxygen
catalyzation
for my limacoids.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.769
I put it in
my slug food.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.267
Oh.
Yeah.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.780
It's for nutrition,
not napalm.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.189
Parrish,

22:06.325 --> 22:07.610
when they cut you
from the Astraeus Project,

22:07.743 --> 22:09.483
you were very vocal
about being done
with everyone.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.360
Because you're
all imbeciles!

22:11.497 --> 22:13.078
The Astraeus Project
is the biggest thing

22:13.207 --> 22:15.368
to happen in the
world of science
in a millennium.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.412
I deserve to be
part of it.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.746
Everyone wants to go.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.870
And anyone who says
othenNise is lying.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.000
JO: Get anything
from Parrish?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.843
Uh, mostly insults.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.635
But I don't think
he's involved.
And my PALs are useless.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.973
Zane's trying to
get them back online.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.888
He said something's
overtaxing the system.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.681
You didn't tell him,
did you?

22:36.814 --> 22:38.179
Not about him.
I, uh...

22:38.315 --> 22:39.600
I want him
to stay focused.

22:39.733 --> 22:40.768
Good. Good.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.061
There's no point starting
a widespread panic

22:42.194 --> 22:43.604
when we're not
even sure if these
things are working.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.900
Now, when...
When you saw Zane,
did he have the head bandage?

22:47.032 --> 22:47.782
Like in the
prediction?

22:47.908 --> 22:48.943
No.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.736
Good. So some things
could still change.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.286
Yeah.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.615
You look distressed.
Did something happen?

22:57.751 --> 22:58.786
Uh, not yet.

22:58.919 --> 22:59.874
What?

23:00.004 --> 23:01.119
The PALs picked up
a prediction,

23:01.255 --> 23:02.745
but we're
working on avoiding it.

23:02.882 --> 23:03.917
Oh, okay, good.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.209
Well, we've
got to get back
to the interviews.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.457
It's going great.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.334
Douglas almost
has a sixth sense
about people.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.386
Hejust, uh,
can read them
like a book.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.715
Yeah. It's kind
ofuncanny.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.017
Thirty seconds,
he just knows.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.637
Well, Douglas,
that's impressive.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.847
Yeah.
Anywho, got to
get back to work.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.394
Titan isn't
coming to us.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.234
Holly, uh, Douglas
is going to catch up
with you in just a second.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.979
Okay? Fargo,
let's go for a walk.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.404
Okay, then,
I'll just get
started alone.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.326
With this long
line of people.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.159
CANDIDATE 3: Hey! Dr. Marten!
CANDIDATE 4: Dr. Marten!

23:38.542 --> 23:40.157
Fargo has
something to say.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.001
I may have borrowed
a pair of PALs
for personal use.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.336
What?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.209
Man, no wonder
the system's crashing.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.128
It's only meant
to support
two pair at a time!

23:48.260 --> 23:50.046
You could have
told me that
in your demonstration.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.716
Whoa, wait,
this doesn't
look good.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.634
(CRACKLING)

23:55.893 --> 23:56.928
No, the core's
overheating

23:57.061 --> 23:59.393
because the system
is trying to process
too much information.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.723
Take them off, Fargo!

24:00.856 --> 24:02.141
No hitting!

24:02.274 --> 24:04.515
Well, that's it.
The PALs are offline.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.558
Wait, for how long?
Maybe for good.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.775
See what you did?

24:07.905 --> 24:08.940
What's the
big deal anyway?

24:09.073 --> 24:10.563
Main Street is about
to be leveled

24:10.699 --> 24:12.781
and the PALs were the
only thing that could
show us how.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.821
That is what you
call a situation?

24:14.954 --> 24:15.989
Again you could
have told me!

24:16.121 --> 24:17.702
Well, we have no idea
if what we saw
is going to happen.

24:17.831 --> 24:18.866
Zane could die.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.614
What? Ow!
Damn it!

24:26.215 --> 24:27.580
What are you staring at?

24:33.889 --> 24:35.174
How could you not
tell me, Lupo?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.763
I was going to.
I just...

24:36.892 --> 24:37.927
When you finally
got around to it?

24:38.060 --> 24:39.140
Would you hold
still please?

24:39.269 --> 24:40.429
Right! Because I wouldn't
want to get an infection,

24:40.562 --> 24:41.597
before I'm blown up
into a billion pieces!

24:41.730 --> 24:42.981
Look, you can kill
each other later.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.096
We have less
than 90 minutes.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.188
Well, the PAL
system's crashed.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.397
It could take weeks
to get it back online.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.142
Without the lenses,
we're flying blind.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.530
Well, for gathering
new information maybe,

24:50.656 --> 24:53.614
but what about the data
you already recorded?

24:53.993 --> 24:56.359
Well, ifthe
hard drive is okay,

24:56.870 --> 24:58.406
we could check
with Henry to see

24:58.539 --> 25:00.200
if his immersion
projection system
could handle

25:00.332 --> 25:01.788
the conversion process
of the PAL memory files.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.282
It's worth a shot.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.416
All right, I'll pull...
I'll pull the
hard drive.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.786
Thanks.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.253
I gotta get
these out.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.371
Oh, okay. Sit down.
I'll do it.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.429
(GRUNTS)

25:15.431 --> 25:16.386
Ready?
Yeah.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.971
Well, yeah.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.847
Oh! Whoa!

25:24.982 --> 25:26.518
Dry socket!

25:26.942 --> 25:28.148
Yeah, could've warned...
Could've mentioned that.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.357
That could have
been mentioned.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.271
So a good day, huh?

25:30.404 --> 25:31.860
Yeah, epic. Epic.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.521
Yeah, first time
I've ever worked
on a crisis

25:33.657 --> 25:35.158
before it actually
happened.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.024
Well, I thinkthat
we have all realized

25:37.161 --> 25:39.277
that our future
is not set in stone.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.153
We're going to
figure this out.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.496
Yeah.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.079
Um...

25:50.507 --> 25:52.043
You can go to Titan.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.883
I mean, you wrote
a space book.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.593
A book on space
medicine, but that's...

25:56.722 --> 25:58.303
But it was your dream.

25:59.433 --> 26:02.345
I let go of that dream
a long time ago.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.480
Well, now you got
a second chance.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.105
Okay?

26:10.277 --> 26:12.188
I can take care
of them.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.520
Kevin and Jenna.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.897
You would do that?

26:18.619 --> 26:20.450
Well, we'd miss you
like crazy, but...

26:23.624 --> 26:25.865
Yeah, we'd be okay.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.206
Just think
about it, okay?

26:30.798 --> 26:32.038
Okay.

26:35.469 --> 26:36.834
The hard drive
looks okay.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.218
Here, take it to Henry
and see what he
can find out.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.339
I'm going to
try to get the
system back up.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.806
You, uh,
coming, real cop?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.724
Yeah.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.356
Hey, sorry I abandoned
you like that.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.325
How'd it go?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.536
You know what?
It was okay.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.155
I mean, I don't know
how it was for them,

27:06.291 --> 27:08.623
but, uh, I feel
kind of exhilarated.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.708
Like we were
connecﬂng.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.624
Sometimes you just
have to face
your fear, right?

27:14.091 --> 27:16.047
So, do you want
to call in
the next victim?

27:16.885 --> 27:20.298
Actually, there's something
I have to tell you, Holly.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.388
I'm not the fearless
leader you think I am.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.678
In truth, I'm actually
just as insecure as you.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.051
No, in the interviews
you're so...

27:27.187 --> 27:29.052
I used a pair
of Zane's PALs

27:29.231 --> 27:30.812
to do some
psychological
profiling.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.358
Oh.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.192
That's...

27:37.531 --> 27:38.896
That's kind of major.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.194
I know, but they really
helped me assess
the candidates.

27:41.326 --> 27:45.911
And, I admit I may have
been a little overzealous
in dismissing some of them,

27:47.499 --> 27:49.410
but I think I just really
wanted to impress you.

27:49.543 --> 27:51.204
So you made
your choices
based on

27:51.336 --> 27:54.294
what an experimental
technology
told you to do?

27:54.423 --> 27:55.287
Kind of.

27:55.424 --> 27:59.087
Douglas, this mission
is a huge responsibility.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.254
It's my responsibility

28:00.387 --> 28:02.298
and I take that
very seriously.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.383
Ijust...

28:04.516 --> 28:05.471
(STAMMERING)

28:05.601 --> 28:08.513
I need to take
a moment to
decide what...

28:09.188 --> 28:10.394
We're done
for today.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.395
So I guess dinner's off.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.861
The PALs keep
a visual record
of what you see,

28:23.994 --> 28:26.827
similar to the DVR
on your TV.

28:27.664 --> 28:31.031
These are some of the
most complex files
I've ever seen.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.954
But I've been able
to extract enough data

28:33.086 --> 28:34.951
to recreate some
key elements.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.999
Well, anything you
can show us would help.

28:37.132 --> 28:41.091
And it'll continue
to render and provide
more detail over time.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.175
It's kind of creepy.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.895
Tell me about it.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.119
(SIGHS)

29:10.415 --> 29:11.450
I should have told him.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.958
I should have
warned Zane
about what we saw.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.539
Save him.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.336
He'll get over it.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.423
The data we've been
able to pull will show

29:22.552 --> 29:24.258
the prediction
in Cafe Diem

29:24.388 --> 29:25.924
from just before
the explosion.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.216
Okay, um, can you...

29:27.349 --> 29:29.590
Can you play this back
again but more slowly?

29:29.726 --> 29:30.886
Sure.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.350
(BEEPING)

29:39.569 --> 29:40.854
CARTER: Stop.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.395
Yeah. There.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.791
There was a shockwave
before the flames.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.421
Well, the timing
between the shockwave

29:58.547 --> 30:01.163
and the flame
would be a matter
of milliseconds.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.211
And dependent
on the point
of detonation.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.423
Mmm.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.261
Let's take
a look outside.
Okay.

30:14.104 --> 30:16.060
It's starting
to render.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.688
Oh, wow.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.188
JO: What is it?

30:26.450 --> 30:28.406
Explosion didn't
start downtown.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.326
It started at G.D.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.919
CARTER: It's going
to wipe out the town.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.462
I want any unstable
projects secured

30:46.595 --> 30:48.711
and all G.D. personnel
evacuated in 15 minutes.

30:48.847 --> 30:49.962
We only have 20.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.258
Well, that gives us
five to spare.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.471
Take your security teams,

30:52.601 --> 30:53.716
do a sweep
of the building

30:53.852 --> 30:54.967
make sure no one
gets left behind.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.764
Already in process
and they're almost clear.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.262
(PHONE BEEPING)
Oh.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.890
Zane's almost got the
PAL system running again.
I'm going down.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.107
Keep me apprised.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.191
Dr. Marten,

31:04.321 --> 31:05.777
you're overseeing
the transfer
of the FTL drive.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.988
Yes. It's already
being moved to
a secure location offsite.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.367
Okay, great.
You should
stay with it

31:09.493 --> 31:10.573
and I'll get in touch
with you as soon as

31:10.702 --> 31:12.567
everything in here
is under control.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.328
What?

31:16.333 --> 31:17.698
I knew you
had it in you.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.415
MAN ON P.A.: Security alert.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.829
Thanks.

31:29.179 --> 31:30.339
CARTER: Man, if! had this

31:30.472 --> 31:32.929
when I was a Marshal on
crime scene investigation,

31:33.058 --> 31:34.218
that'd be easy.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.887
HENRY: Yeah,
and this will be great
for the Astraeus crew.

31:36.019 --> 31:39.511
I mean, they'll know
Titan like it was...
Main Street.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.228
Yeah.

31:41.358 --> 31:45.852
Hey, um, how is Grace
with you applying
for the mission?

31:45.987 --> 31:47.022
Oh, she's
been amazing.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.020
I mean, she knows
that going to space
has always been a dream

31:49.157 --> 31:50.818
so she's ready
to support it.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.441
Good. Yeah...

31:53.245 --> 31:54.530
Because, uh,

31:55.497 --> 31:58.284
I told Allison that I'd...
That I'd support her.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.657
(LAUGHS) That's huge.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.203
Well, yeah...
So, what'd she say?

32:01.336 --> 32:04.078
Well, she didn't
have to say anything...

32:06.466 --> 32:07.751
CARTER: That Fargo's head?

32:08.135 --> 32:09.875
Well, technically
it's his bobble head.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.342
Yeah, but that came
all the way from G.D.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.838
Debris has been found
up to a mile from
an explosion's origin.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.427
Okay.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.509
What is that?

32:27.529 --> 32:29.986
That looks like Dillon's
propellant canister.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.860
We're running out of time.
How close are you?

32:36.997 --> 32:39.739
Well, the PAL processor
works by maintaining
a constant magnetic field.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.288
When Fargo's lenses
overtaxed the system
that field was disrupted.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.001
We tried to jump start it
with this generator,

32:45.130 --> 32:47.337
but it keeps
shutting down again.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.674
You see? See?
This is called
sharing information.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.171
Okay, listen,

32:52.304 --> 32:54.044
I am sorry that
I didn't tell you
what we saw,

32:55.182 --> 32:56.968
but I didn't know
how to handle it.

32:57.601 --> 32:58.716
I knew you cared.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.343
Oh, God,
don't flatter yourself.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.641
Why you got to be
like that? Huh?

33:03.773 --> 33:06.025
Why can't you
just relax and see
where things go?

33:06.151 --> 33:08.358
Because I've done
this before.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.603
We don't work.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.855
We just have a spark.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.451
Sometimes a spark
is all you need.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.720
What do you
see there?

33:38.475 --> 33:40.090
It's a bunch
of burned debris.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.728
It's a fragment
from one of your
propellant canisters.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.313
It may be the cause
of the explosion
we're trying to prevent.

33:47.776 --> 33:48.856
It can't be.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.400
Itcant?

33:51.988 --> 33:54.104
Look, you see
those flames?

33:54.241 --> 33:55.447
Here.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.155
My propellant
is plasma-based.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.619
These flames
are clearly
Class D,

34:01.748 --> 34:03.363
which is
a combustible
metal fire.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.865
What causes
metal to combust?

34:05.460 --> 34:08.793
On this scale, it's
gotta be a massive
thermal meltdown.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.128
The PAL system.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.261
Zane?

34:15.387 --> 34:17.173
The PAL system
is predicting
its own failure.

34:17.305 --> 34:18.841
It's going to...

34:18.974 --> 34:20.714
It's going to explode.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.516
You don't say.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.979
We only have
a couple minutes left.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.531
Core ran too hot,
vaporized the
thermal displacement fluid.

34:35.657 --> 34:36.897
We're reaching
full meltdown.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.148
We're running
out of time.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.365
All right,
how do we
cool it down?

34:39.494 --> 34:41.906
Um, liquid helium
might work.
CARTER: Great.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.370
Or that could trigger
a larger explosion.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.082
Okay, um, we put
a pin in that.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.077
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Core meltdown.
Five minutes.

34:50.213 --> 34:51.498
Hey, Fargo,
clear the building?

34:52.424 --> 34:55.166
Almost, Parrish is
refusing to leave without
his stupid limacoids.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.338
Does no one
understand what
evacuate means?

34:57.470 --> 34:59.176
We're not exactly
on the best terms
right now.

34:59.306 --> 35:02.048
He found out I used
the PALs to eliminate him
from Astraeus.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.302
I'm on my way.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.345
Okay, Zane...

35:04.477 --> 35:06.342
Don't worry.
We'll get out.
Okay, go.

35:06.479 --> 35:11.018
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Core meltdown. Five minutes to
minimum safe distance.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.519
You should go.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.858
I'm not going
anywhere.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.898
We can figure
this out together.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.151
Parrish, forget
the stupid slugs.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.401
Right. Because throwing
away my life's work
is so inconsequential.

35:22.537 --> 35:26.200
Especially to a spoiled
Eureka legacy who's had
everything handed to him.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.322
What are you
talking about?

35:27.459 --> 35:29.575
I killed myself at MIT
while everyone was
out killing orcs

35:29.711 --> 35:32.544
and pillaging villages
and getting
all sorts of booty.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.287
I'm sure it didn't hurt
to have good old Grandpa

35:34.424 --> 35:36.756
Pierre Fargo's name
to open up all those
doors for you either.

35:37.052 --> 35:39.293
And then you slammed
those doors shut
in my face.

35:39.429 --> 35:42.671
Okay, I admit I may
have been a little harsh
during your evaluation,

35:42.807 --> 35:45.298
but if we survive this,
I will give you a do-over.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.720
Happy?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.348
Oh, hello.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.721
What the hell
is everyone
still doing here?

35:50.857 --> 35:54.315
Sheriff, relax,
my limacoids are
ready for transport.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.356
Wait, that's it,
the...

36:01.910 --> 36:03.025
The dormancy gel.

36:04.245 --> 36:07.282
Could the dormancy gel
pull the heat away
from the PAL processing core?

36:07.624 --> 36:09.114
At those temperatures
it's effective...

36:09.250 --> 36:10.239
Yes or no?

36:10.377 --> 36:11.162
Maybe.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.329
Good. Close enough.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.293
Fargo, can you reroute
the dormancy gel
to the cooling chamber?

36:14.422 --> 36:15.502
On it.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.293
Great. I'll keep Jo
and Zane in the loop.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.294
Security alert.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.761
Are you sure this is
going to work?

36:23.890 --> 36:25.300
I think we're all
probably going to die.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.934
So why are you
still here?

36:27.060 --> 36:28.721
Legacy or not,
I'm the head of G.D.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.684
If it's going down,
I'm going down with it.

36:30.814 --> 36:31.929
Security alert.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.180
We're out of time, Fargo!

36:33.316 --> 36:34.351
It's on its way!

36:34.484 --> 36:35.314
Get that Jo?

36:35.443 --> 36:37.434
Yeah, I got it.
It's coming right at us.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.194
Okay, we're all
clear on this side.

Where the hell is it?

36:46.371 --> 36:47.406
Where the hell is it?

36:47.539 --> 36:48.574
Uh, Carter...

36:48.707 --> 36:50.197
Fargo, you sure
you sent it
to the right place?

36:50.333 --> 36:51.834
Dude, it should be
there already.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.128
Okay, the system's
not responding.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.467
We're going to have
to open that valve manually

37:02.595 --> 37:05.052
from inside the pool,
after I bypass
the security gate.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.341
JO: Okay. Got it!

37:06.474 --> 37:08.010
Careful, Jo,
I'm right behind you.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.774
I can't.
The steam's too hot.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.362
Oh!

38:44.155 --> 38:46.271
Thank you for
being there for me.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.988
My pleasure.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.443
But that was
the last time.

Is he still staring?

39:05.385 --> 39:07.797
Yeah. Jo, I thought
it was over.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.506
It was. It is.

39:09.639 --> 39:10.879
Whatever it is,

39:11.975 --> 39:14.011
I don't even
know anymore.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.013
Mmm.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.102
Well,

39:19.107 --> 39:20.142
why don't you
just let it be

39:20.275 --> 39:22.891
instead of trying
to put a label on it?

39:23.278 --> 39:24.438
Let it be.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.482
That's your
sage advice.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.279
That's it.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.322
Yeah.
Yeah.

39:30.451 --> 39:31.907
Maybe.
Maybe.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.151
Here's your order,
Shenﬁ.

39:33.288 --> 39:34.573
There should be
plenty for the kids, too.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.571
Okay, thanks, Vince.
I'll see you later.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.418
HOLLY: The FTL
is securely back at G.D.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.293
And we'll restart the
selection process
again tomorrow.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.340
This time
without the PALs.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.298
And I'm even giving
Parrish another shot.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.591
That's very big
of you, Douglas.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.184
Listen, if you want
to compare notes,

39:58.313 --> 40:00.520
I'd still like to
take you to dinner.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.104
I don't think so.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.098
Right. Understandable.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.234
I meant that
I don't want to work,

40:07.363 --> 40:10.855
but something
more off the clock
might be nice.

40:11.868 --> 40:13.358
VVeH,okay,

40:13.870 --> 40:16.577
but in the spirit
of new beginnings
and full disclosure,

40:16.706 --> 40:17.741
I have to confess.

40:17.874 --> 40:22.618
I saw a prediction
of you kissing me.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.369
No pressure.

40:24.589 --> 40:27.126
Me kissing you?

40:27.258 --> 40:28.168
Go figure.

40:29.385 --> 40:32.377
Douglas, the lenses show
potential security risks.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.547
Now it's awkward.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.099
I should go.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.890
I'm sorry, Douglas.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.236
Douglas Fargo,

40:58.831 --> 41:00.742
too dangerous to love.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.707
(CHUCKLING)

41:14.639 --> 41:16.220
So, uh, how's it going
there with "The Blake"?

41:16.349 --> 41:18.510
I love it.
It's... It's great.

41:18.643 --> 41:19.598
First page was great,

41:19.727 --> 41:21.433
second page, magic.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.727
I don't even want...
Yeah, it's...

41:23.856 --> 41:25.357
You're...
You're gifted.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.853
Oh, you know what?

41:27.986 --> 41:30.352
I have been thinking
about your offer

41:30.613 --> 41:31.853
and as sweet as it is,

41:33.950 --> 41:35.781
I will not be going
on the mission.

41:37.662 --> 41:39.402
But this is your dream.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.123
It was.

41:41.416 --> 41:42.872
But now this is.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.242
I have a great life here,

41:45.378 --> 41:46.788
and I don't want to
miss a minute of it.

41:47.422 --> 41:51.256
Besides, there's this guy
that I've been seeing.

41:51.384 --> 41:54.171
Oh, you can't...
Not for a man.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.339
Who is it?
I'll kick his ass.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.136
He's a good guy?

41:58.266 --> 41:59.346
Mmm.
Yeah?

41:59.475 --> 42:00.555
Good kisser?
Yeah.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.141
(PHONE RINGING)
Oh.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.390
(CHUCKLING)

42:07.275 --> 42:09.391
Hey, Henry,
this better be good.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.150
Hey, what's going on?

42:15.992 --> 42:16.981
Hey, Jack.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.154
Fargo asked me
to keep scanning
the hard drive

42:19.287 --> 42:23.200
from the PALs system
looking for any other
significant security threats.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.372
And you found one?

42:25.501 --> 42:26.832
From earlier today.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.076
One frame.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.419
I just thought
you should see it.

42:34.761 --> 42:36.547
I'm sure you didn't
even notice it.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.135
Yeah, that was...

42:45.646 --> 42:47.557
So Allison's a threat?

42:56.574 --> 42:58.235
These thing's have been
glitchy since we
turned them on.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.153
Yeah, yeah,
but they're still
surprisingly accurate.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.072
Look, Jack,
this may mean nothing.

43:02.663 --> 43:03.994
Ijust...

43:04.165 --> 43:06.406
I just thought
you should know.

43:09.337 --> 43:10.577
Right.
