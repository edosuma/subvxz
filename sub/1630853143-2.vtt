WEBVTT

00:20.311 --> 00:22.439
[tense music plays]

00:24.983 --> 00:26.359
[woman wailing]

00:29.320 --> 00:30.530
[midwife] Breathe, Your Grace.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.365
[wailing continues]

00:34.034 --> 00:35.493
-Push!
-[doctor] Breathe!

00:35.577 --> 00:36.661
[midwife] Yes! Yes!

00:37.245 --> 00:39.539
Your Grace, I shall need you to push.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.375
-[Duchess of Hastings wailing]
-[midwife] Very good. Yes!

00:43.501 --> 00:45.211
You must breathe, Your Grace.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.172
Someone must tell me something!

00:48.381 --> 00:50.967
-Would you move?
-What are you doing in here, Lady Danbury?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.887
-I am going in, Your Grace.
-No place for a lady in there.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.556
Someone must be with her.
If not her husband, then--

00:56.639 --> 00:58.141
[Duchess of Hastings screams]

01:02.145 --> 01:04.147
[wailing]

01:04.773 --> 01:06.316
[groans loudly]

01:06.399 --> 01:07.650
[doctor] Push.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.694
I must know
if I am at long last to have a son.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.112
[doctor] Forceps.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.363
[wailing continues]

01:13.823 --> 01:16.659
-I can see the head. Push!
-Push!

01:16.743 --> 01:18.328
-Tell me!
-Tell him!

01:18.411 --> 01:19.454
-Breathe, Your Grace!
-Yes.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.414
-Push.
-Push, Your Grace! Push!

01:22.457 --> 01:24.626
What is it? What is it?

01:24.709 --> 01:25.627
[baby gurgles]

01:26.586 --> 01:27.879
It is a boy, Your Grace.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.256
[baby crying]

01:57.283 --> 01:58.952
[baby coos]

01:59.661 --> 02:00.703
I have a son.

02:01.996 --> 02:02.831
I have a son!

02:03.540 --> 02:05.375
[all cheering]

02:06.751 --> 02:07.585
Sarah!

02:11.214 --> 02:12.757
I finally gave him…

02:14.050 --> 02:14.884
a son.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.346
[laughing]

02:18.429 --> 02:19.556
[exhales]

02:20.140 --> 02:21.015
[gasps]

02:21.599 --> 02:23.017
[struggling breaths]

02:24.477 --> 02:25.311
Sarah.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.396
Doctor!

02:27.564 --> 02:29.149
There is too much blood.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.401
Sarah…

02:34.654 --> 02:36.197
[Duke of Hastings] A perfect son!

02:36.281 --> 02:41.286
Simon Arthur Henry Fitzranulph Basset,
the next Duke of Hastings!

02:41.369 --> 02:42.537
[all cheering]

02:52.046 --> 02:53.006
[maid] Your Grace.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.634
Would you like us to arrange
the duchess's room for you?

02:58.469 --> 02:59.304
No.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.389
That will not be necessary.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.198
[Lady Whistledown]
There will forever be just two words

03:18.281 --> 03:20.158
that come to this author's mind

03:20.241 --> 03:22.410
the morning after any good party,

03:22.493 --> 03:25.038
"shock" and "delight."

03:25.663 --> 03:31.544
Well, dear reader, the scandalous accounts
from last night's soiree at Vauxhall

03:31.628 --> 03:35.131
are quite shocking and delightful indeed.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.550
It has arrived, Your Majesty!

03:39.552 --> 03:41.429
At once! At once!

03:41.512 --> 03:45.808
Emerging, phoenix-like
from the ashes of irrelevance,

03:45.892 --> 03:49.062
is one Miss Daphne Bridgerton.

03:49.687 --> 03:55.109
The illustrious debutante
was seen dancing not once, but twice

03:55.193 --> 03:59.239
with the season's most eligible
and most uncatchable rake,

03:59.322 --> 04:01.324
the Duke of Hastings.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.534
Where are you going so early, Your Grace?

04:04.827 --> 04:06.454
To promenade.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.385
-[Lady Danbury] He is smiling.
-[Violet giggles]

04:20.468 --> 04:22.053
[Lady Danbury] The duke rarely smiles.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.180
Daphne has an excellent sense of humor.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.640
She will need it.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.476
Life as a duchess will have many demands.

04:28.559 --> 04:29.727
Hosting balls,

04:29.811 --> 04:31.479
greeting foreign dignitaries…

04:31.562 --> 04:33.690
Daphne will not merely be in society.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.108
She will be leading it.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.110
I have prepared her quite well,
Lady Danbury.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.111
Mm.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.529
[both laugh]

04:39.612 --> 04:41.614
-Eight balls.
-No.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.117
Eight balls.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.495
You do want our plan to succeed,
do you not?

04:47.578 --> 04:48.871
The purpose of this arrangement

04:48.955 --> 04:51.124
is to keep the marriage-minded mothers
of the ton at bay,

04:51.207 --> 04:53.293
not hurl myself
directly into the lion's den.

04:53.376 --> 04:57.672
The purpose of this arrangement is
to ensure I marry my very first season.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.382
I shall grant you four.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.217
-Six balls.
-Five.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.803
Six. And you must send flowers.

05:03.886 --> 05:04.804
Today.

05:04.887 --> 05:07.056
-Expensive ones.
-[Simon sighs]

05:07.724 --> 05:10.685
If you were truly courting me,
you'd buy out every florist in town.

05:10.768 --> 05:13.771
If I were truly courting you,
I would not need flowers,

05:13.855 --> 05:16.316
only five minutes alone
with you in a drawing room.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.153
I did not mean…

05:20.653 --> 05:22.572
-Six balls, Your Grace.
-Very well.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.365
Though I shall see about the flowers.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.200
And you must remember,

05:26.284 --> 05:28.536
no one can know
about our little arrangement.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.498
Nor about what happened
last night with Lord Berbrooke.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.751
Ah, yes. How is your hand this morning?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.919
You must know you did nothing wrong.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.423
What I know is that even the rumor
of my being alone with a man,

05:40.923 --> 05:43.926
let alone punching him, will ruin me.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.013
I have no interest in causing a scandal, 
Miss Bridgerton.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.599
I should imagine
with you it comes naturally.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.225
[both chuckle softly]

05:52.310 --> 05:53.478
[horse neighs]

05:55.355 --> 05:57.815
[Penelope whispering] 
Of course I don't know. How would I know?

05:58.733 --> 06:01.861
Because I can't ask her.
Because I don't know how it happened.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.072
It's disturbing!

06:04.155 --> 06:05.948
What are you girls talking about?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.494
Penelope is wondering
about Miss Thompson.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.912
-Prudence--
-What of Miss Thompson?

06:10.995 --> 06:13.956
-[Prudence] Penelope has inquiries.
-[Penelope] If you do not fall silent--

06:14.040 --> 06:15.708
[Philipa] About Miss Thompson's condition.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.710
-I beg your pardon?
-They know, ma'am.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.588
How did it happen, Mama?
Is there to be a baby?

06:20.671 --> 06:22.298
That will be enough.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.884
My lord, are you hearing this?

06:24.967 --> 06:26.177
What are we going to do?

06:26.260 --> 06:28.679
There's no need for your hysterics.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.431
Why is Miss Thompson to be kept away?

06:30.515 --> 06:32.517
Because her condition is catching.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.402
So, Daphne may be in love.
Does she think it an accomplishment?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.404
What exactly has she accomplished, then?
[scoffs]

06:44.487 --> 06:47.949
She certainly did not build that man
or bake him. He simply showed up.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.951
Now he straggles about.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.994
He likes her face, probably.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.246
Perhaps her hair.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.873
Having a nice face and pleasant hair
is not an accomplishment.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.084
Do you know what is an accomplishment? 
[laughs]

06:58.167 --> 07:00.503
Attending university!

07:00.586 --> 07:02.672
If I were a man,
I could do that, you know.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.550
Instead, I shall have to stand by
and watch dear Mama appear proud

07:05.633 --> 07:08.469
because some man should like
to admire my sister's face and hair

07:08.553 --> 07:10.054
and fill her up with babies!

07:11.013 --> 07:13.307
Oh, Penelope, you're not listening
to a word I say.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.685
Whoa! Oh!

07:15.768 --> 07:18.479
I know of someone… with child.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.815
Is it your mama?

07:20.898 --> 07:22.442
Is she not advanced in age?

07:22.525 --> 07:24.318
I suppose your father
should still want a boy--

07:24.402 --> 07:25.862
It is not Mama.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.447
It is a maid.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.992
-Which one of your maids is married?
-She is not married.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.077
How did she become with child
if she is not married?

07:33.161 --> 07:35.663
I do not know, but I will find out.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.123
You must.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.500
Otherwise, how can we make sure
it never happens to us?

07:39.584 --> 07:41.335
We have accomplishments to acquire.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.425
Two dances? With a duke?

07:47.508 --> 07:49.552
He was quite taken
with your sister, Hyacinth.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.889
The entire party was, for that matter.
All eyes were on Daphne.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.766
-At least enjoy some toast, dearest.
-I am not hungry, Mama.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.769
Are you certain the entire party
was not simply eyeing a tear in her dress?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.605
Or a misstep she took on the dance floor?

08:00.688 --> 08:03.357
I do wonder, Daphne, might we count
on the duke at the Crawford ball?

08:03.441 --> 08:06.736
-I should think it a fair chance.
-What about the Ramsbury ball, Friday?

08:06.819 --> 08:09.572
-And what about the grand picnic?
-We shall see, Mama.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.115
[Hyacinth] How terrible for Fran

08:11.199 --> 08:13.784
that she'll be off practicing pianoforte
with Aunt Winnie all season

08:13.868 --> 08:15.703
and miss Daphne's engagement to the duke.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.288
[Gregory]
Did Francesca leave for Bath?

08:17.371 --> 08:19.040
How does a lady come to be with child?

08:20.082 --> 08:22.793
-Eloise, what a question!
-I thought one needed to be married.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.713
-What are you talking about?
-Apparently, it's not even a requirement.

08:25.796 --> 08:26.881
Eloise, that is enough.

08:28.758 --> 08:29.926
Oh, well…

08:30.009 --> 08:32.428
Daphne, you were playing so lovely.
Please, do go on.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.099
-I take it the two of you know?
-Do not look at me.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.644
-Have you ever visited a farm, El?
-[Eloise growls]

08:39.727 --> 08:42.313
I hope you are not encouraging
improper topics of conversation.

08:42.396 --> 08:43.731
[Benedict] Not at all, Mother.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.234
In fact, we were just heading off to…

08:46.317 --> 08:47.235
take our sticks out.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.612
-Colin Bridgerton!
-A round of fencing.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.492
-Miss? Humboldt is coming.
-Humboldt is coming?

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
-Humboldt?
-Why is Humboldt coming?

08:59.205 --> 09:00.498
Has someone arrived, Humboldt?

09:00.581 --> 09:03.209
-Callers for Miss Daphne, ma'am.
-[Daphne squeals, laughs]

09:03.292 --> 09:06.003
But… the duke.
You already have a caller, dearest.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.798
Well, I suppose now I have more.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.715
[laughs]

09:09.799 --> 09:11.384
[horses neighing]

09:20.226 --> 09:21.602
What is happening?

09:27.650 --> 09:28.484
Coming through!

09:34.490 --> 09:36.534
When you said you will be taking me 
to your family…

09:36.617 --> 09:37.451
Move!

09:37.535 --> 09:39.662
…I expected to be the only one present!

09:39.745 --> 09:41.914
I wore my satin knee breeches
for the occasion!

09:41.998 --> 09:43.124
Out of my way at once!

09:49.255 --> 09:50.131
Dear God!

09:51.424 --> 09:52.758
I shall speak to my soon-to-be--

09:52.842 --> 09:56.095
-No, Lord Berbrooke, you must go.
-You said you wanted this handled quickly.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.930
-You gave me your word.
-I intend to keep it.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.683
You're the only man who proposed,
therefore the only one I considered.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.185
This is nothing more
than a terrible confusion.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.563
For now, you must go,
along with everyone else.

10:08.232 --> 10:11.193
-I should like to know what is going on.
-I would like to know the very same.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.697
Perhaps we might begin with why you chose
to interrupt such an exquisite morning.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.782
Because she is already engaged
to be married.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.576
The duke has already asked for your hand?

10:18.659 --> 10:20.411
I am not engaged, Mama.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.496
Has anyone truly proposed to me? No.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.458
Have I proposed to anyone else?
I do not believe I have.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.294
-Do not be disrespectful, sister.
-Disrespectful?

10:28.794 --> 10:31.505
I cannot imagine
a greater show of disrespect

10:31.589 --> 10:33.633
than promising me to Nigel Berbrooke.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.009
Anthony, tell me you did not.

10:35.092 --> 10:38.346
-He's a fine choice. I looked into him.
-You promised your sister to that man?

10:38.429 --> 10:40.598
-Not well enough, apparently.
-What?

10:41.390 --> 10:42.475
Does not matter.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.269
I now have many choices indeed.
I do not need--

10:45.353 --> 10:48.147
You have suitors.
You do not have what matters: proposals.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.566
Except, of course, from Lord Berbrooke.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.444
Whatever happened to his eye?
It's quite grotesque.

10:53.527 --> 10:57.114
Daphne has charmed a duke, Anthony.
You must know that changes everything.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.575
Please do not tell me
this rebellion is to do with Hastings.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.534
They are courting.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.787
They've danced
a couple of times together at a ball.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.705
Colin has done the same with Penelope.

11:04.789 --> 11:05.873
It does not signify--

11:05.956 --> 11:09.418
They promenaded this morning,
and he sent flowers today to both of us.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.087
Expensive ones.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.468
The duke is not a serious suitor.

11:17.551 --> 11:18.719
He will never marry.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.513
I have known him since we were boys.

11:20.596 --> 11:24.392
It is not bravado,
or denial, or even immaturity.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.726
It appears that way to me.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.938
I will not marry Nigel Berbrooke.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.402
I have acted
in your best interests, sister.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.655
One day, you will understand.
One day, you will be most appreciative.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.782
The contract to Berbrooke
will be drawn up,

11:39.865 --> 11:41.283
and you shall marry him.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.455
[doors open, slam shut]

11:46.539 --> 11:49.083
-Mama…
-You need not worry, dearest.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.877
Once Lord Berbrooke witnesses
the seriousness of the duke's intentions,

11:51.961 --> 11:53.462
he will have no choice but to retreat.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.340
Lord Berbrooke
may not respect a woman's choice,

11:56.424 --> 11:58.676
but he certainly will respect a man's.

12:00.428 --> 12:05.641
Well, and if the duke is not… serious,
I shall have others.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.019
Daphne, I saw the way the two of you
looked at each other last night

12:09.103 --> 12:10.104
and this morning.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.356
There are no others.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.692
There is only the duke.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.278
[both chuckling]

12:20.865 --> 12:23.159
-[exhales]
-[grunt echoing]

12:25.494 --> 12:26.704
[Simon grunts]

12:26.787 --> 12:29.623
Did you truly dance
with the Bridgerton girl? Twice?

12:30.541 --> 12:32.918
[overlapping grunts]

12:33.002 --> 12:35.004
Remind me again
why you were the first person

12:35.087 --> 12:38.048
I chose to reacquaint myself with
upon my return to town.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.759
-Admit it, friend.
-[Simon grunts]

12:39.842 --> 12:42.553
-You missed me.
-[Simon grunts, gasps]

12:42.636 --> 12:43.971
[door opens]

12:44.805 --> 12:46.474
[Simon panting]

12:46.557 --> 12:49.477
-Might I have a word?
-Have as many as you like, Bridgerton.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.979
[overlapping grunts and panting]

12:52.646 --> 12:54.523
You'll come down here,
or must I come up there?

12:55.483 --> 13:00.196
My fists have taken enough pounding
from your chin today, Your Dukeship.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.280
[Simon chuckles]

13:03.240 --> 13:05.284
[Simon sniffs, exhales]

13:06.452 --> 13:08.120
-[Anthony grunts]
-[Simon grunts]

13:08.204 --> 13:09.497
[Anthony groans]

13:09.580 --> 13:11.290
Well? What seems to be so urgent?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.292
I'd like to know
what was going through your head

13:13.375 --> 13:14.710
last night and this morning.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.880
You have to be more precise. A great deal
goes on in a mind as quick as mine.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.089
Are you courting my sister?

13:19.173 --> 13:21.050
-Should I not be courting your sister?
-No.

13:21.133 --> 13:24.220
And I can think of dozens of reasons why,
starting with, "She is my sister,"

13:24.303 --> 13:26.764
and ending with,
"She is already engaged to be married,"

13:26.847 --> 13:31.143
and then perhaps circling back to,
"She is my sister."

13:31.227 --> 13:33.437
-[Simon grunts]
-[Will laughs]

13:33.521 --> 13:36.565
I was unaware of an engagement.
Have the banns been read, then?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.776
I assure you
all the formal preparations are underway.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.528
I arranged everything
with Nigel Berbrooke,

13:40.611 --> 13:42.154
having given him my word.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.739
So you have struck something squarely.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.867
Your problem is that Berbrooke
is an unworthy suitor for Miss Bridgerton.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.994
-[Simon grunts]
-[Anthony groans]

13:49.078 --> 13:50.246
He is perfectly decent.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.916
He is never seen going
in and out of brothels, at least.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.627
I even know where he's been
the past few years, right here in London.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.296
As opposed to some gambling hell,
or backwater slum,

13:59.380 --> 14:02.925
or wherever it was you chose to fuck about
for God knows whatever reason.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.135
[Anthony pants heavily]

14:07.221 --> 14:10.641
Nigel Berbrooke is hardly a saint.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.601
You are and have long been a good friend.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.145
The best, really. But this is my sister.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.440
Think of all
that we have shared as friends.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.819
It is furthest from my intentions
to offend you,

14:21.902 --> 14:25.531
but surely you can understand
that family must come before all else!

14:26.824 --> 14:27.950
[frustrated exhale]

14:31.078 --> 14:33.038
[Duke of Hastings]
Why is he not saying anything?

14:33.122 --> 14:35.374
He is four years old.
He should be able to speak.

14:35.457 --> 14:39.336
He is quite advanced in his letters,
more so than any child I have taught.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.507
He would have to be bloody Shakespeare
with his letters if he cannot speak.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.466
[sighs]

14:45.509 --> 14:46.844
Let us hear it, boy.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.430
Give me a word, a grunt.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.474
-Talk to me, damn you!
-You're scaring him!

14:52.558 --> 14:55.352
And if that is what it should take,
I shall get a sound from him still.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.687
No.

14:58.939 --> 14:59.940
What did you say?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.611
D-- D-- D-- D-- Do…

15:04.278 --> 15:06.864
n-- n-- n-- not…

15:07.573 --> 15:08.574
What is he doing?

15:11.243 --> 15:12.828
[sharp rapid breathing]

15:13.454 --> 15:15.664
-He's an imbecile.
-Your Grace--

15:15.748 --> 15:17.041
He is an idiot!

15:19.460 --> 15:20.544
My God.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.465
Do you know how precarious
of a situation we are in, boy?

15:25.424 --> 15:27.468
We have been granted this line.

15:27.551 --> 15:30.137
The monarchy itself has declared it.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.348
But it will only remain ours

15:32.431 --> 15:35.434
so long as we remain extraordinary.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.104
The Hastings name cannot land

15:39.188 --> 15:41.732
in the quivering hands of a half-wit!

15:41.815 --> 15:43.233
[Young Simon whimpers]

15:44.526 --> 15:46.946
Get him out of my sight.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.614
This boy is dead to me.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.659
[whimpering continues]

15:53.911 --> 15:55.162
[horse neighs]

16:01.085 --> 16:02.044
[knock at door]

16:05.047 --> 16:07.549
I found you a few sweets.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.343
I thought you might enjoy them

16:09.426 --> 16:11.345
while everyone else
attends tonight's ball.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.806
You can come in.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.849
I'm sure there's plenty to spare.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.654
I hear they have decided
not to send you home to your papa.

16:28.737 --> 16:33.283
I dare say I am relieved.
I can only imagine how he will react to…

16:34.076 --> 16:35.077
Your condition?

16:37.579 --> 16:38.497
Marina…

16:39.748 --> 16:40.708
may I ask?

16:41.667 --> 16:42.918
How did it happen?

16:46.088 --> 16:46.964
Cake.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.216
Cake?

16:52.386 --> 16:55.973
Our vicar in Somerset
was given to hours-long sermons.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.893
Three, four,
sometimes five hours they last.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.771
I would nearly swoon
from hunger and fatigue.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.481
Until one Sunday,

17:04.565 --> 17:07.693
just when I thought I'd have to crawl 
under the pew from exhaustion,

17:07.776 --> 17:09.486
the eldest Crane boy, George…

17:11.030 --> 17:15.284
Sir George Crane sneaked me
a wrapped bundle of cake and biscuits.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.703
The vicar would've had his head
if he knew.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.829
[Penelope chuckles]

17:19.371 --> 17:23.250
After some time,
the bundles came to include small notes.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.837
We passed tiny missives
back and forth for months.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.217
I've never longed for church 
quite so much.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.889
-And where is Sir George now?
-Spain.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.725
He went off to fight with Wellington…

17:39.808 --> 17:41.602
but he continued to write.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.854
-See?
-[Penelope gasps]

17:47.191 --> 17:48.108
So…

17:49.651 --> 17:52.780
your condition, then,
it was brought about by…

17:54.156 --> 17:55.032
Love.

17:56.742 --> 17:57.993
It was love, Penelope.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.125
[violin sonata playing]

18:07.920 --> 18:09.296
[dog barking]

18:17.888 --> 18:20.974
Your Majesty, the royal physician
has a report on the king.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.559
How is it possible there's not been

18:22.643 --> 18:24.978
a single compelling betrothal
yet this season?

18:25.646 --> 18:27.147
Terribly unexciting!

18:27.231 --> 18:30.109
I could tell you a delicious tidbit
about our former scullery maid.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.944
I don't care about a dish wench.

18:32.027 --> 18:35.322
I wish to be entertained, enthralled.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.868
Should the royal physician seek to tell me
my husband is dead, Brimsley?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.286
I do not believe so, Your Majesty.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.080
Then tell him I am occupied,

18:43.163 --> 18:44.957
and bring me my stationery at once.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.610
[Rose] Will it be the rubies 
or the pearls, miss?

19:13.694 --> 19:14.778
The pearls, of course.

19:14.862 --> 19:19.575
Mama, perhaps the rubies would better
catch the eye of even more new suitors?

19:21.910 --> 19:24.913
If I am not to put
all my eggs in one basket,

19:24.997 --> 19:25.914
I must…

19:26.415 --> 19:27.499
collect more…

19:28.375 --> 19:29.710
-eggs.
-[Eloise, Violet laugh]

19:29.793 --> 19:31.962
The duke truly has
put your head in a spin.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.965
More like Lord Berbrooke
must spin far away.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.049
[doors open]

19:36.133 --> 19:39.219
-Good heavens. What is it, Mrs. Wilson?
-The queen, ma'am.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.638
-Has she fallen ill?
-Has King George caused her harm?

19:41.722 --> 19:46.476
-Her Majesty's royal stationery.
-She has written to you, my lady.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.155
-What does it say, Mama?
-[Violet chuckles]

20:02.910 --> 20:07.623
I am invited to a private tea
with the queen in two days' time.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.500
[Violet chuckles]

20:13.045 --> 20:14.630
Never mind the pearls.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.466
You shall wear
the family diamonds tonight.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.343
[Violet chuckles]

20:24.389 --> 20:27.476
Would it pain you
to wear some color, Your Grace?

20:27.559 --> 20:31.021
The London season
is already terribly monotonous as it is.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.940
Must your wardrobe do the same?

20:33.023 --> 20:36.526
-I was told this look is all the rage.
-Certainly not mine.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.029
Take my arm, before you make us late.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.502
So, you are not dead, after all.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.046
My lady, we were not expecting your visit.

20:56.129 --> 20:58.465
Not once seen in London,
no news of your education,

20:58.548 --> 21:00.050
not a word about you from your father.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.553
Yet here you are, alive and breathing.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.473
Stand up, boy, so I may look at you.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.438
Your mother would weep

21:13.522 --> 21:15.983
to know her dearest friend
was a stranger to her son.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.402
You look just like her.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.529
And a good thing too.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.116
Lady Danbury, my lord.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.790
I see you've not learned any manners.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.292
Have you learned to read,

21:34.126 --> 21:35.002
to write,

21:35.627 --> 21:37.587
to ride a horse, to fence?

21:38.755 --> 21:40.299
Then, why ever are you not in school?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.722
I c-- c-- can

21:46.805 --> 21:47.639
n-- n-- not

21:48.223 --> 21:50.434
s-- s-- speak.

21:55.981 --> 21:59.026
When I was a girl, some centuries ago,

21:59.568 --> 22:01.528
I was afraid even of my own reflection.

22:01.611 --> 22:05.657
I entered a room and attempted
to dissolve into the shadows.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.911
But there is only so long one
in a position such as ours can hide.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.206
I knew I would have to step
into the light someday,

22:13.290 --> 22:15.167
and I could not very well be frightened.

22:15.250 --> 22:20.047
So, instead, I made myself frightening.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.425
I sharpened my wit,
my wardrobe, and my eye,

22:23.508 --> 22:26.762
and I made myself
the most terrifying creature

22:26.845 --> 22:28.347
in any room I entered.

22:30.057 --> 22:30.891
Come.

22:36.396 --> 22:39.024
You can speak.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.152
I understood you well enough.

22:42.652 --> 22:46.365
And I will help you
to overcome this stammer of yours.

22:46.948 --> 22:50.410
But in exchange, you must promise me

22:51.244 --> 22:54.122
that when you step into the light…

22:55.207 --> 22:59.044
you will be worthy
of the attention you command.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.505
Hmm?

23:07.761 --> 23:09.763
[guests talking, laughing]

23:26.571 --> 23:28.198
A dance, Miss Bridgerton?

23:28.281 --> 23:32.202
I shall need someone else
to seek me a glass of ratafia, then.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.787
Lord Bridgerton…

23:34.663 --> 23:35.831
do me the honor?

23:36.581 --> 23:38.041
Of course, Lady Danbury.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.716
Six balls no more.
I must have you at eight.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.552
-Along with a picnic.
-A picnic?

23:48.635 --> 23:50.303
I am afraid we are required

23:50.387 --> 23:52.180
to fan the flames of our charade.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.392
Oh, because of Lord Berbrooke, I presume?
I heard.

23:56.601 --> 24:01.440
We must make him believe that you are
on the very precipice of a proposal…

24:01.940 --> 24:03.024
so he will leave me alone.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.318
I should hope
I do not lose my balance, then.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.820
I should hope not, either,

24:06.903 --> 24:08.947
for you will be glued
to my side all evening.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.575
And we must look like
we are enjoying ourselves,

24:11.658 --> 24:12.784
as difficult as that may be.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.494
Yes, quite.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.498
[classical dance music playing]

24:27.757 --> 24:29.593
[inaudible dialogue]

25:07.214 --> 25:08.256
[music ends]

25:09.382 --> 25:10.967
Go dance with your sister.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.761
-Why?
-Because I asked you to!

25:13.428 --> 25:14.513
[Benedict groans]

25:15.722 --> 25:17.224
[Anthony] Perhaps I was unclear.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.559
Is it your wish
for me to insult your sister, Bridgerton?

25:19.643 --> 25:20.477
On the contrary.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.562
You wish your sister
to marry a loathsome toad, then.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.939
[Nigel] Lord Bridgerton.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.690
Forgive the intrusion,

25:25.774 --> 25:27.359
but, if need be,

25:27.442 --> 25:30.362
I will happily restate my intentions
with respect to your sister.

25:30.445 --> 25:34.533
She is a prize I have long coveted
for her beauty, for her grace--

25:34.616 --> 25:35.951
For her powerful right hook?

25:36.993 --> 25:39.120
I must know whether I can count on you

25:39.204 --> 25:41.831
to handle this misunderstanding, my lord?

25:41.915 --> 25:44.459
I certainly wish to avoid
any kind of embarrassment.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.627
Rather late for that.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.464
Are you too friendly with the duke
or simply intimidated by his rank--

25:49.548 --> 25:50.590
Easy, Berbrooke.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.801
I assured you I will resolve the matter,

25:52.884 --> 25:55.679
a matter which I shall remind the duke
is none of his concern.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.764
Perhaps you're not the authority
on what concerns me,

25:57.847 --> 25:59.849
nor on the matter
of Lord Berbrooke's character.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.019
I shall do my best
by your sister, Bridgerton.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.314
And perhaps even she might learn
to return my affections over time.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.732
Do come off it, Berbrooke.

26:07.816 --> 26:10.026
I presume he failed to mention
how he got that purple eye.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.780
-I was careless with a cabinet door.
-He was careless with his honor.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.783
He attempted something last night
I shan't dignify with words

26:16.866 --> 26:18.201
when your sister planted a facer.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.245
Deservedly so.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.624
My lord, you must know--

26:24.708 --> 26:26.501
Daphne would have told me
if this were true.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.921
Would she?

26:36.803 --> 26:39.139
You will never speak
to my sister again, Berbrooke.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.557
But we are to be married.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.226
You are to be buried
if you so much as look in her direction.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.566
Be grateful you will not take a punch
from yet another Bridgerton.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.237
What has happened? Brother?

26:54.321 --> 26:57.449
You need not worry about Berbrooke.
Sister, it is done.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.826
[sighs deeply]

27:04.497 --> 27:06.499
-You told him?
-I had to say something.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.336
-All will be well, though, I assure you.
-You assure me?

27:09.961 --> 27:11.880
Despite what you
and my brother may think,

27:11.963 --> 27:15.425
I am quite capable of speaking for myself.
You had no right.

27:15.508 --> 27:17.594
-I was trying to help.
-Well, you did not.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.139
All you did
was underestimate Nigel's entitlement.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.850
Not to mention, people are watching.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.978
You cannot assure me of anything.

27:38.198 --> 27:41.534
A crush of an evening, Your Grace.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.245
Would you not agree?

27:45.163 --> 27:48.917
The young lady
is as rare a treasure as there is.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.211
Do try not to bungle it up.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.214
Hmm? Thank you.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.383
And how have you been?

28:02.013 --> 28:04.974
-I think I shall take the air tonight.
-Your Grace.

28:14.401 --> 28:15.652
Only me, Your Grace.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.904
Are you following me, Berbrooke?

28:17.987 --> 28:19.489
I thought this matter settled.

28:19.572 --> 28:22.409
It was settled
until you had to go and spoil it.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.327
I implore you to speak again
with the viscount.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.371
Last night was a mistake, I admit.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.956
A temporary lack of judgment.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.499
You understand that, do you not?

28:29.582 --> 28:33.294
There is not and never will be any kind
of understanding between the two of us.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.339
-Go home, Berbrooke.
-But you do not need her.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.632
You're a duke.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.052
You already have the money,
and the connections, and the standing.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.347
I need her.
Why can you not just let me have this one?

28:44.431 --> 28:46.683
I think it really ought
to be up to Miss Bridgerton.

28:46.766 --> 28:49.144
When I am buying a horse,
I do not negotiate with the horse.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.687
Should you continue to follow me--

28:50.770 --> 28:52.480
Why, then, have you not asked for her hand

28:52.564 --> 28:55.024
if you are so fond of her,
and she so smitten with you?

28:55.108 --> 28:57.193
Why have you not already proposed?

28:58.069 --> 28:59.529
Unless you have already had her.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.616
If you have, you must tell me.

29:03.700 --> 29:07.454
For if I had already known
she was loose and damaged, not intact,

29:07.537 --> 29:09.205
-I never would have--
-Stop talking.

29:10.498 --> 29:13.251
I shall not have you question
the lady's unimpeachable honor again.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.169
Yes.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.006
Yes, very well.
That is all I had hoped to hear.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.509
You do not deserve to breathe
the same air as her.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.428
Now, go home.

29:23.511 --> 29:24.929
And you do?

29:25.013 --> 29:27.348
I've heard the stories
of your father, Hastings.

29:27.432 --> 29:31.102
I know how badly he wanted a son, an heir,

29:31.186 --> 29:33.062
and I know how badly he tried to get one

29:33.146 --> 29:35.607
when it seemed
your poor mother could not deliver.

29:35.690 --> 29:40.820
If anyone were to ever turn a blind eye
to a man's temporary lack of judgment,

29:40.904 --> 29:41.738
it would be you.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.740
The apple should not fall very far,
should it?

29:43.823 --> 29:45.533
[overlapping grunts]

29:56.920 --> 29:58.296
[Nigel grunting, moaning]

30:05.303 --> 30:08.097
Your Grace, may I present Lady Danbury

30:08.181 --> 30:10.725
and Lord Basset?

30:17.482 --> 30:18.316
Well…

30:19.275 --> 30:21.611
this is a most unwelcome intrusion.

30:21.694 --> 30:25.698
I thought Your Grace might be relieved
to know that your son is alive and well.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.701
Your staff seemed
somewhat surprised by the fact.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.370
What is the point of your visit?

30:33.331 --> 30:36.334
I am receiving high marks
in all of my studies, sir.

30:37.877 --> 30:39.796
I ride, and I fence, and I shoot…

30:41.297 --> 30:43.800
exceptionally well, I am told.

30:46.719 --> 30:47.720
I even…

30:51.140 --> 30:52.058
I…

30:54.185 --> 30:56.479
You are my worst failure.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.607
I beg your pardon?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.025
I am sure you do.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.235
I shan't again.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.197
Might I remind you that this boy
is to be the next Duke of Hastings,

31:06.281 --> 31:09.659
and that he requires whatever reserves
of fatherly nature reside

31:09.742 --> 31:11.786
in that frigid heart of yours?

31:11.870 --> 31:12.829
You may…

31:13.538 --> 31:15.665
so long as I may remind you of your place,

31:16.541 --> 31:18.376
which is out of my sight

31:18.459 --> 31:20.628
and with your bitch mouth shut.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.802
I wrote to you many times
to let you know I'm…

31:28.720 --> 31:30.305
I'm not… [hesitates]

31:31.556 --> 31:32.515
not dead.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.936
Did you receive my letters?

31:37.020 --> 31:39.022
It is a deep enough wound
to live with the knowledge

31:39.105 --> 31:41.941
that you shall one day inherit Hastings,

31:42.025 --> 31:45.236
but to witness your struggle
is too great an insult.

31:46.321 --> 31:49.657
You are as useless
as your mother proved to be,

31:50.366 --> 31:53.703
so I shall pursue the same recourse
with you as I did with her,

31:54.579 --> 31:58.124
to forget
that you ever sullied these halls.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.484
[Lady Whistledown]
This author has often thought the heart

32:24.567 --> 32:26.569
a most curious of instruments,

32:26.653 --> 32:28.905
heeding neither reason nor rank.

32:28.988 --> 32:32.867
For what possible explanation
might Miss Bridgerton have

32:32.951 --> 32:35.495
for entertaining the suit of a mere baron

32:35.578 --> 32:37.997
when she seems to have secured a duke?

32:38.498 --> 32:42.293
Could the debutante's mind
not be the only thing amiss?

32:42.877 --> 32:44.921
The recipe is my own, miss.

32:46.255 --> 32:48.299
I'm certain the duke 
should find it appealing.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.718
It does not matter
what the duke thinks, Rose.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.929
He is gallant, is he not?
With refined taste--

32:53.012 --> 32:53.972
Stop.

32:56.557 --> 32:57.892
Is the rouge not to your liking?

33:00.853 --> 33:01.729
No.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.399
It is perfect.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.318
I should like some more.

33:13.282 --> 33:16.202
[attendees talking, laughing]

33:17.704 --> 33:20.164
[Lady Whistledown]
Let it be known, dear reader,

33:20.248 --> 33:24.460
that if this bizarre behavior portends
yet another scandal,

33:24.544 --> 33:27.714
then be sure that I shall uncover it,

33:27.797 --> 33:31.217
for there is nothing
like an excursion into nature

33:31.300 --> 33:34.721
to lift the spirits and loosen the tongue.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.557
I hear she may be courting
with bumbling Berbrooke.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.684
Quite a good match for her,
I rather think.

33:39.767 --> 33:40.977
[both snickering]

33:46.190 --> 33:49.569
-Mama, might I go play with Eloise?
-A lady does not play, Penelope.

33:49.652 --> 33:52.488
Forgive me, Mama. Might I go
promenade for suitors with Eloise?

33:52.572 --> 33:53.698
Very well, then.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.747
What have you learned from your maid,
the one who is in the family way?

34:00.830 --> 34:04.208
-What happened? How did it happen?
-She said it was love.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.129
Love? That doesn't stand to reason.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.756
No, it certainly does not.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.841
Look at my mama. Three children.

34:11.924 --> 34:14.385
Would anyone presume
that had anything to do with love?

34:14.469 --> 34:16.971
Well, what else did she say?
Was she not frightened?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.014
More…

34:18.723 --> 34:20.475
sad than frightened.

34:20.558 --> 34:23.644
But there may be a chance for her
to have a happy ending yet, I suppose.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.397
She wants to escape to the country,
where she and her love will marry.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.400
Then she has even greater reason
to be frightened.

34:29.484 --> 34:33.154
Once she is married, her life is over.
Scarcely an escape, Penelope.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.572
Oh, that poor maid!

34:48.002 --> 34:50.713
I was not aware, sister,
of what Berbrooke attempted.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.341
I would have helped you.
You should have told me.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.051
Would you have believed me?

34:55.968 --> 34:57.887
Did you only change your mind
about Lord Berbrooke

34:57.970 --> 34:59.680
because another man told you the truth?

34:59.764 --> 35:01.265
You truly esteem me so little?

35:01.349 --> 35:05.061
After I apprised you of my wishes,
and you proceeded to ignore them…

35:05.144 --> 35:06.562
yes, brother, I do.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.606
[galloping horse approaches]

35:16.364 --> 35:18.074
-You are late.
-Apologies.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.909
Should we rejoin your family
at their camp?

35:19.992 --> 35:21.369
Certainly not.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.957
We must promenade past the group
of men playing their games up ahead.

35:30.878 --> 35:32.713
Whatever happened to your hand?

35:32.797 --> 35:33.714
Boxing.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.759
It's an absurdity that passes
for entertainment amongst men.

35:36.843 --> 35:40.012
-My cuff, button it.
-I beg your pardon?

35:48.813 --> 35:51.983
You need not feel your evident worry.
Berbrooke is--

35:52.066 --> 35:54.318
Have you not heard
what Whistledown writes of me still?

35:54.402 --> 35:57.572
No. Even if you believe
Lord Berbrooke is taken care of,

35:57.655 --> 35:58.990
our ruse is not finished.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.449
I'm still in need of a husband.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.910
Though I am flattered,
I'm afraid I must reject your proposal.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.705
Yes, I know.
You are not the marrying type.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.333
Yet have you considered
you are not the type women wish to marry?

36:09.417 --> 36:11.043
I suppose if I were forced 
to take a wife,

36:11.127 --> 36:12.795
you would be
the least objectionable option.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.714
-Is that meant to be a compliment?
-Yes.

36:14.797 --> 36:18.050
But it is no matter, for you wish
to marry for love, do you not?

36:19.260 --> 36:20.303
Of course I do.

36:22.972 --> 36:23.973
They still looking?

36:25.224 --> 36:26.475
[men chuckling]

36:27.685 --> 36:28.895
[man 1] Here he comes now.

36:32.607 --> 36:33.941
[Nigel] Bridgerton!

36:34.025 --> 36:35.401
What have you done?

36:38.070 --> 36:40.531
I bring cheerful news, Bridgertons.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.283
I have taken matters in my own hands

36:42.366 --> 36:45.620
and sought a special license
for my wedding to Miss Bridgerton.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.706
-There is to be no wedding.
-I told you. The arrangement is canceled.

36:48.789 --> 36:50.791
Lord Berbrooke,
you look in a great deal of pain.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.877
Shall we continue this
in a more private location?

36:52.960 --> 36:55.046
I require no further conversation.

36:55.129 --> 36:58.299
Though, perhaps I am finally speaking
to the true head of the Bridgerton house.

36:58.382 --> 36:59.217
For if it were you,

36:59.300 --> 37:02.595
I imagine you would have instructed
your sister to take better care

37:02.678 --> 37:04.680
than to encourage certain attentions

37:04.764 --> 37:06.724
while alone with me
on the Dark Walk at Vauxhall.

37:06.807 --> 37:11.103
Of course, mere hearsay
of such a scandal could wreak havoc

37:11.187 --> 37:13.481
on even the most influential of families.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.943
What would someone like,
say, Lady Whistledown do

37:17.026 --> 37:18.736
with such unseemly information?

37:18.819 --> 37:20.863
-Is that a threat?
-It is certainly not.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.741
Because in three days, I am to marry.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.661
I have the diamond of the season.

37:26.744 --> 37:29.497
I have the very best the ton has to offer.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.957
I have a Bridgerton.

37:31.540 --> 37:35.127
And I shall save her,
as well as your entire family,

37:35.211 --> 37:38.047
from the ruin
which you could not protect them.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.386
[chuckles]

37:43.469 --> 37:46.806
I look forward to the union
of our great families.

37:47.723 --> 37:48.683
Bridgerton.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.351
Hastings.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.566
[Anthony] I must issue
my challenge to Berbrooke straight away.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.484
[Violet] Anthony…

37:58.567 --> 38:00.987
I assure you
I've been properly trained in the manner.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.656
You are not to duel with Lord Berbrooke.
Do you understand me?

38:04.323 --> 38:07.118
I do not care what kind of training
you think you may have.

38:07.201 --> 38:09.412
It is illegal,
not to mention positively horrific.

38:09.495 --> 38:11.789
Gentlemen are left
with no other choice, Mother.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.041
When a young woman,
let alone one's sister,

38:14.125 --> 38:17.086
is rumored to be dishonored,
the consequences shall be deadly!

38:17.169 --> 38:18.087
It is no solution.

38:19.171 --> 38:22.008
Should Lord Berbrooke decide
to make good on his threat

38:22.091 --> 38:25.720
before you shoot him dead, brother,
what happens then?

38:26.637 --> 38:30.308
He may decide
to open his tiny mouth at any moment,

38:30.391 --> 38:32.018
and then I shall be ruined…

38:33.394 --> 38:34.478
as will we all.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.984
I must marry Nigel Berbrooke.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.194
It is the only choice.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.713
[Daphne sniffles]

39:00.796 --> 39:02.923
Rose, can you leave us for a moment?

39:05.343 --> 39:06.260
[Daphne sniffles]

39:18.230 --> 39:19.899
I have taught you to believe

39:19.982 --> 39:23.652
that marriage is the best
that life has to offer,

39:24.236 --> 39:25.863
and that remains true.

39:26.614 --> 39:30.951
But it is not simply a partner
that marriage provides.

39:31.035 --> 39:34.872
You will have comfort
and a house to tend,

39:34.955 --> 39:37.458
and most importantly, children.

39:39.418 --> 39:42.338
You will throw yourself
into raising your family,

39:42.421 --> 39:44.882
and you will find much joy.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.301
I am certain.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.724
You and Papa…

39:56.644 --> 39:58.896
The two of you were so beautiful, Mama.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.817
That is what I wanted.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.904
That is all I hoped to one day find.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.323
As did I.

40:14.453 --> 40:16.080
[Violet chuckles affectionately]

40:25.840 --> 40:27.842
[exhales]

40:28.717 --> 40:30.177
[Benedict] Eloise Bridgerton.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.305
[Eloise groans]

40:40.187 --> 40:41.188
Go on, then.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.065
Chastise me.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.944
Spare one for me?

41:00.249 --> 41:02.001
Suppose I desire something different.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.962
-How do you mean?
-Just different.

41:05.754 --> 41:08.090
I watch Daphne prepare for these balls

41:08.174 --> 41:10.843
with all of those dresses
and the many suitors,

41:10.926 --> 41:12.261
and I am exhausted.

41:13.053 --> 41:14.597
Suppose I want a different life,

41:14.680 --> 41:18.058
that I truly believe
I am quite capable of something more,

41:19.226 --> 41:21.479
even when I am not allowed
to have anything else.

41:23.939 --> 41:26.066
Then I would say…

41:28.277 --> 41:29.445
that you're not the only one.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.500
[overlapping grunts]

41:43.709 --> 41:44.793
[Simon moans]

41:49.924 --> 41:51.926
Still on that dance floor
with Miss Bridgerton?

41:54.345 --> 41:55.304
How is she?

41:55.387 --> 41:57.139
[exhales sharply] She is to marry.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.308
Then you are free to do as you please.

42:01.060 --> 42:01.894
Another.

42:27.127 --> 42:28.170
[exhales lightly]

42:56.073 --> 42:57.074
Your Majesty.

42:57.157 --> 42:58.909
[piano sonata playing]

43:08.377 --> 43:09.420
[sniffs sharply]

43:12.047 --> 43:13.299
[sniffles]

43:14.008 --> 43:15.009
[grunts lightly]

43:15.593 --> 43:16.719
What do you think?

43:20.389 --> 43:21.390
Of the music?

43:23.225 --> 43:24.768
I find it quite beautiful.

43:26.812 --> 43:27.980
Is it Mozart?

43:28.897 --> 43:32.067
I became acquainted with Mr. Mozart
when he was not ten years old.

43:32.151 --> 43:36.030
The boy accompanied me as I sang an aria,
and I declared then and there

43:36.113 --> 43:38.824
that he should become
one of the finest composers in Europe.

43:38.907 --> 43:41.035
And certainly you were right.

43:41.744 --> 43:45.205
I'm rarely wrong about such matters.
Do you know why?

43:45.289 --> 43:47.916
Because when I choose
to extend to someone my favor,

43:48.000 --> 43:49.627
I expect them to make good on it.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.587
-Your Majesty, is this about--
-Brimsley!

43:52.504 --> 43:53.380
Fresh snuff.

44:00.763 --> 44:03.265
-That one is a terrible gossip.
-[door closes]

44:03.349 --> 44:05.017
If we were to speak freely
in his presence,

44:05.100 --> 44:08.020
before long, the whole of England
would know our business.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.189
I see.

44:12.107 --> 44:13.484
I suppose you do see.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.986
I expected a great future
for your daughter

44:16.070 --> 44:18.155
upon her entrance into society.

44:18.238 --> 44:21.742
A future with someone like a duke,
perhaps.

44:21.825 --> 44:23.369
A pairing like that…

44:24.703 --> 44:25.579
Well…

44:26.664 --> 44:29.166
it would certainly be
most enchanting indeed.

44:29.958 --> 44:31.293
[Queen Charlotte clears throat]

44:35.089 --> 44:36.215
[door closes]

44:43.305 --> 44:44.640
As I was saying,

44:44.723 --> 44:47.601
the glow of success
benefited not only the young maestro.

44:48.686 --> 44:51.814
Surely the entire Mozart family
would have felt the repercussions,

44:51.897 --> 44:54.358
had their boys stayed forever in Salzburg.

44:58.237 --> 44:59.446
Would you not agree?

45:06.829 --> 45:09.123
Why, yes. Yes, I would.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.626
But what are we to do, ma'am?

45:12.710 --> 45:16.213
We are to invite Lady Berbrooke
over for tea, Mrs. Wilson, at once.

45:23.095 --> 45:26.390
-Nigel is my one and only child.
-[Violet] Mm-hmm.

45:26.473 --> 45:28.142
Very special boy, indeed.

45:28.225 --> 45:32.312
In fact, I often say
God did not bless me with another

45:32.396 --> 45:35.524
because perfection
had already been achieved. [chuckles]

45:35.607 --> 45:36.567
My goodness.

45:36.650 --> 45:37.651
[Lady Berbrooke] Mm.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.195
Not every lady can be so blessed, I know.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.740
-[Daphne sniffles]
-Miss Bridgerton…

45:42.823 --> 45:45.784
allow me to set my eyes upon you.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.036
Mm.

45:48.537 --> 45:49.705
Certainly healthy.

45:50.831 --> 45:53.250
Even if your countenance is a bit drawn.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.418
[Daphne inhales sharply]

45:54.501 --> 45:57.379
-It was a terribly late evening.
-All the excitement, I suppose.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.298
Yet you must try harder, dear.

45:59.965 --> 46:01.759
My Nigel is quite discerning.

46:01.842 --> 46:05.429
He already turned away
many more handsome debutantes, saying,

46:05.512 --> 46:06.638
"Mother…

46:06.722 --> 46:10.392
[chuckles]
…I prize accomplishment over beauty."

46:11.435 --> 46:12.644
Can you believe it?

46:15.397 --> 46:16.857
[crunching loudly]

46:17.441 --> 46:19.693
-[bell rings]
-[Wilson] Ooh! Oh!

46:20.277 --> 46:23.155
That mistress of yours is going
through the biscuits quick.

46:23.655 --> 46:26.408
Do not worry, Rose. I shall handle it.

46:29.703 --> 46:30.579
Housekeepers…

46:31.413 --> 46:33.123
They believe themselves
the sun and the moon,

46:33.207 --> 46:35.751
when in truth, it is us lady's maids
that do all the hard work.

46:35.834 --> 46:37.002
[Celia chuckles]

46:37.085 --> 46:38.837
I have one just like her.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.297
You are quite fortunate, though.

46:40.380 --> 46:41.840
How troublesome could a household be

46:41.924 --> 46:44.927
with only Lady Berbrooke
and young Lord Berbrooke to look after?

46:45.010 --> 46:47.137
Oh, you have no idea.

46:48.931 --> 46:53.435
You ate but not one bite at tea, my dear!

46:53.519 --> 46:56.688
A young lady must be well fed
if she is to bear children.

46:56.772 --> 47:00.025
Kippers on rye every morning
worked wonders for me

47:00.108 --> 47:01.902
when I conceived my Nigel.

47:01.985 --> 47:04.196
[Lady Berbrooke and Violet chuckling]

47:07.074 --> 47:08.617
[gasps] What have you found?

47:08.700 --> 47:09.827
[Daphne] What is going on?

47:09.910 --> 47:11.703
You could not think
I'd ask that woman for tea

47:11.787 --> 47:13.247
without a thought for you, could you?

47:13.330 --> 47:16.291
The help hears everything, as we all know.

47:16.375 --> 47:17.793
She has heard a good deal, in fact.

47:17.876 --> 47:20.587
Lord Berbrooke has a boy
by one of his maids

47:20.671 --> 47:22.297
that he refused to provide for.

47:22.381 --> 47:24.508
Sent the maid and child away
to live off scraps.

47:24.591 --> 47:25.425
Horrible man.

47:25.509 --> 47:28.178
Horrible enough
for us to be rid of him, let us pray.

47:29.763 --> 47:31.598
Well, he-- He will only deny it.

47:32.641 --> 47:35.394
And who will believe a group of women
over a man's word?

47:35.894 --> 47:36.979
Perhaps no one.

47:37.729 --> 47:42.067
But they will if Lady Whistledown does.
So we shall do what women do.

47:43.235 --> 47:44.319
We shall talk.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.242
And the only reason he married her

47:50.325 --> 47:54.413
is because his père squandered
the accounts on some scheme in America.

47:54.496 --> 47:56.707
[gasps theatrically] Oh, mon Dieu.

47:56.790 --> 47:59.585
Is it not the most lurid story
of the season?

48:00.919 --> 48:02.588
Perhaps not the most lurid.

48:05.173 --> 48:07.551
Well, every baron has a bastard.

48:07.634 --> 48:10.429
A bastard he sent away
before the miss even popped?

48:11.638 --> 48:14.725
You don't say.
Well, we must tell Jennie and Mary.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.063
[inaudible dialogue]

48:21.648 --> 48:24.651
[Lady Whistledown]
It has come to this author's attention

48:24.735 --> 48:28.822
that the ton is abuzz
with a most sordid tale.

48:33.702 --> 48:38.123
It is said
one cannot judge a book by its cover.

48:38.206 --> 48:41.251
But in the case
of the bumbling Baron Berbrooke,

48:41.335 --> 48:46.423
it seems his displeasing appearance
is quite an apt metaphor

48:46.506 --> 48:49.051
for the state of affairs in his household.

48:50.761 --> 48:52.262
I would not be surprised

48:52.346 --> 48:56.850
if Lord Berbrooke were called away
to the country on alleged business…

48:56.934 --> 48:58.810
Business which, perhaps,

48:58.894 --> 49:02.397
might involve sending
some much overdue funds

49:02.481 --> 49:05.525
to one former maid and young boy,

49:05.609 --> 49:08.195
who we can only hope
takes after his mother.

49:11.490 --> 49:14.076
I have heard talk
that Berbrooke has left town.

49:15.535 --> 49:18.747
I think this solution to our problem
did not come about by chance.

49:25.212 --> 49:27.422
I am resolved to handle matters
differently in the future.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.385
Or perhaps not at all.

49:34.137 --> 49:37.516
I know society has dictated
your present role in this family, Anthony,

49:37.599 --> 49:41.186
but with Daphne officially out,
I assure you, I am more than capable.

49:45.857 --> 49:46.984
This is for Daphne.

49:48.193 --> 49:49.027
Tulips.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.738
They symbolize passion.

49:53.073 --> 49:56.535
A most appropriate hem for your sister
when she decides to marry the duke.

49:58.537 --> 50:00.872
Perhaps your bride would like the same.

50:02.958 --> 50:04.084
Good night, Mother.

50:07.295 --> 50:09.297
[Violet chuckles lightly]

50:20.809 --> 50:21.852
[door opens]

50:26.732 --> 50:30.652
Surely your mistress does not plan
on confining me to this bedroom forever.

50:30.736 --> 50:31.611
[Varney chuckles]

50:31.695 --> 50:35.907
I should think one has only herself
to blame for her confinement, miss.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.671
[footsteps approaching]

50:59.139 --> 51:00.015
Eloise.

51:01.808 --> 51:03.810
Uh… Did you need something?

51:05.187 --> 51:06.021
No.

51:09.024 --> 51:09.858
Yes.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.486
I am… [clears throat]

51:12.569 --> 51:15.781
…glad this business
with Nigel Berbrooke is over for you.

51:16.865 --> 51:17.783
Thank you.

51:21.787 --> 51:25.499
You hear stories
about appalling arrangements,

51:25.582 --> 51:28.168
and hopeless endings, and…

51:29.669 --> 51:31.505
Well, it is all very frightening.

51:32.422 --> 51:35.842
-Eloise, you mustn't worry about--
-Are you not frightened, too, sister?

51:36.968 --> 51:39.554
Of marriage? Of… children?

51:40.680 --> 51:42.724
I find children to be delightful.

51:43.850 --> 51:46.561
Though,
you are not currently proving my point.

51:48.814 --> 51:51.274
Surely you've not forgotten
what happened to Mama?

51:52.025 --> 51:53.401
Her screams that night.

51:55.195 --> 51:57.405
You tried to hide it by singing to me,

51:57.489 --> 51:58.573
but her voice…

51:59.574 --> 52:00.826
it rattled the windows.

52:02.244 --> 52:06.248
I hear them sometimes still 
in my dreams.

52:08.208 --> 52:09.459
She almost died…

52:10.794 --> 52:12.212
mere months after Papa.

52:14.172 --> 52:15.632
[Eloise sighs tremulously]

52:15.757 --> 52:17.592
Of course I have not forgotten.

52:21.429 --> 52:22.347
Of course…

52:23.598 --> 52:24.641
I am frightened.

52:25.725 --> 52:29.437
I dare say I would be a fool at this point
not to be terrified.

52:30.230 --> 52:33.441
You remember correctly
that Mama had a…

52:34.526 --> 52:35.652
perilous night.

52:36.862 --> 52:39.072
But at dawn, the world had Hyacinth,

52:40.198 --> 52:42.159
and we are all the richer for it.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.328
Yes, Eloise, there…

52:45.912 --> 52:49.541
are perhaps darker turns in these woods

52:49.624 --> 52:51.376
than we've been taught to expect.

52:52.961 --> 52:55.338
There is light to be found at their end.

52:56.339 --> 52:57.340
And I know…

52:58.258 --> 52:59.176
one day…

53:00.260 --> 53:01.636
we both will find it.

53:04.723 --> 53:06.224
It must be taxing.

53:07.726 --> 53:08.560
What?

53:10.270 --> 53:13.607
The game of pretend
that you feel you must endlessly maintain.

53:18.445 --> 53:21.531
[rendition of "In My Blood"
by Vitamin String Quartet playing]

53:22.449 --> 53:23.783
[guests laughing, talking]

53:53.730 --> 53:55.023
Good evening.

53:58.026 --> 54:01.321
You should not have lost your temper
with Lord Berbrooke.

54:01.404 --> 54:03.823
You should know something about me,
Miss Bridgerton.

54:03.907 --> 54:05.617
I will not tolerate a bully.

54:06.117 --> 54:08.578
And you should know
something about me, Your Grace.

54:09.329 --> 54:10.622
I will not have this go wrong.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.707
You mean our ruse?

54:14.751 --> 54:16.419
It is more than a ruse now.

54:17.462 --> 54:19.256
It is more than a negotiation.

54:20.548 --> 54:22.676
This is not just about finding 
the best match

54:22.759 --> 54:24.427
to impress Lady Whistledown…

54:25.720 --> 54:28.431
or the queen, or any member of the ton.

54:28.515 --> 54:32.185
This is about a life, Your Grace. My life.

54:33.311 --> 54:35.272
I must finally take charge of it.

54:36.356 --> 54:38.358
I cannot afford to do otherwise.

54:39.025 --> 54:40.986
So I shall not have this go wrong.

54:41.069 --> 54:43.655
If you are not in agreement,
then you should tell me now.

54:45.740 --> 54:46.658
I shall agree…

54:47.867 --> 54:48.952
on one condition.

54:49.035 --> 54:51.871
-You do not understand, Your Grace--
-That you call me Simon.

54:53.373 --> 54:57.377
If we are truly to seem to be courting,
if this is to be a match like no other,

54:57.460 --> 54:59.045
you should call me by my name.

54:59.129 --> 55:00.130
Very well…

55:01.881 --> 55:02.799
Simon.

55:03.341 --> 55:04.259
[stifled chuckle]

55:04.342 --> 55:06.970
Is there something funny about my name?

55:07.554 --> 55:09.014
No, no, no.

55:10.181 --> 55:12.475
It is a perfectly fine name.

55:12.559 --> 55:13.893
Oh, perfectly fine?

55:13.977 --> 55:16.062
Very well… Daphne.

55:28.950 --> 55:30.368
I wish to find a husband…

55:32.162 --> 55:35.206
so that I may have a family, children.

55:36.416 --> 55:38.043
Then let us find you a husband.

55:56.603 --> 55:58.146
May I have the pleasure?

56:01.858 --> 56:03.026
Of course.

56:11.910 --> 56:15.747
The two of you certainly make
a captivating match, Your Grace.

56:21.961 --> 56:23.838
Whatever is bothering you?

56:29.803 --> 56:32.555
N-Nothing at all, Lady Danbury.

56:37.268 --> 56:38.770
[strained gasping]

56:47.529 --> 56:49.072
[gasping for air]

56:49.155 --> 56:50.949
My… My son.

56:51.032 --> 56:54.911
[strained whispering] You have returned
to take your rightful place.

56:55.036 --> 56:57.330
[coughs, gasping]

56:58.331 --> 56:59.499
My heart may be failing,

57:00.667 --> 57:02.377
but I assure you,

57:03.169 --> 57:04.254
it swells with pride,

57:05.171 --> 57:07.841
knowing the duke you have grown into…

57:08.633 --> 57:09.676
[coughs]

57:09.759 --> 57:14.514
…and the great Hastings name
shall continue.

57:14.597 --> 57:16.349
[labored panting]

57:16.433 --> 57:18.184
Listen to me very closely…

57:20.603 --> 57:23.106
for I have only returned
to do but one thing…

57:23.189 --> 57:24.357
[intense music plays]

57:24.441 --> 57:25.650
…to make you a vow…

57:26.568 --> 57:28.778
the only vow I will ever make in my life.

57:31.739 --> 57:33.074
I will never marry.

57:34.325 --> 57:36.494
I will never sire an heir.

57:36.578 --> 57:37.954
[Duke of Hastings gasping wetly]

57:38.037 --> 57:41.291
The Hastings line will die with me.

57:41.374 --> 57:42.667
[strained choking]

57:45.044 --> 57:47.547
Are my words clear enough for you, Father?

57:50.258 --> 57:52.844
Speak, you fucking monster.

57:52.927 --> 57:54.929
[tense music intensifies]

57:56.264 --> 57:58.183
-[Duke of Hastings coughs]
-Speak!

57:58.266 --> 57:59.851
[sharp breaths]

58:10.945 --> 58:12.697
[tense music crescendos]
