02:55.546 --> 02:57.696
<i>Sheriff, you gotta get down here.</i>

03:28.830 --> 03:31.893
- We got an ID on her?
- No, sir.

03:31.973 --> 03:34.132
No relation to Paul and Carol.

03:38.122 --> 03:39.938
Who's she?

03:40.758 --> 03:43.308
Well, for now, she's a Jane Doe.

03:44.912 --> 03:47.603
- You got something?
- Nothing was stolen.

03:47.683 --> 03:49.942
Not a scratch on the outside
of the house either.

03:50.868 --> 03:52.768
Doesn't look like someone broke in.

03:52.948 --> 03:56.365
To me, it looks like
they were trying to break out.

06:03.201 --> 06:05.223
Cause of death?

06:05.303 --> 06:07.626
How about we skip this part tonight?

06:08.206 --> 06:11.356
Come on, this one's a soft ball.

06:13.244 --> 06:15.267
Smoke inhalation.

06:15.847 --> 06:19.338
You're telling me
that smoke killed Mr. Howard?

06:19.718 --> 06:23.992
Well, damaged nasal passage,
damaged throat, damaged lungs...

06:24.072 --> 06:27.946
Damaged lungs, yes.
But incompatible with life.

06:28.226 --> 06:33.111
- So, you're saying that's not the COD?
- I'm saying look before you leap.

06:35.016 --> 06:37.138
Where did the police find the body?

06:38.104 --> 06:40.795
- In his kitchen.
- House on fire.

06:40.875 --> 06:43.628
Front door is 30 feet away,
yet, he's not trying to get there.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.597
Lungs are damaged...

06:45.677 --> 06:48.894
...but airways not denuded nearly enough.

06:50.414 --> 06:53.899
So, he stopped breathing
before that fire really got going?

06:55.586 --> 06:57.502
Open him up.

07:00.591 --> 07:03.315
Now. Now you see here?

07:03.395 --> 07:06.645
- Down below the occipital.
- A fracture.

07:08.099 --> 07:11.477
- That explains the swelling in his brain.
- Subdural hematoma.

07:12.487 --> 07:15.297
That's what did it. Not the smoke.

07:17.008 --> 07:19.167
Everybody has a secret.

07:19.247 --> 07:21.860
Some just hide them better than others.

07:21.950 --> 07:24.803
Some people are better at finding them.

07:24.883 --> 07:27.799
You did good. You'll get there.

07:31.121 --> 07:33.779
Nobody's even claimed him yet.

07:34.009 --> 07:38.266
- He was all alone, that's why he died.
- He died because he fell and hit his head.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.723
You got plans tonight?

07:44.803 --> 07:47.886
Emma wants to go see a movie at the Strand.

07:48.105 --> 07:50.308
I thought they'd closed that place down.

07:51.542 --> 07:54.870
No, when was the last time
you even went to go see a movie, Dad?

07:58.052 --> 08:03.716
She has Alzheimer's
and he's building her a house.

08:04.488 --> 08:05.544
The Notebook?

08:05.624 --> 08:09.831
Oh, yeah, your mother made me go
and see it with her for her birthday.

08:09.911 --> 08:12.160
I fell asleep five minutes in.

08:15.132 --> 08:16.655
Yeah.

08:16.935 --> 08:19.752
- Are you alright finishing up?
- Yeah.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.547
What's up, Tilden?

08:25.627 --> 08:27.376
Hematoma.

09:48.893 --> 09:50.862
Stanley.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.777
Hey, Dad!

09:59.637 --> 10:02.110
Stanley got another one.

10:11.015 --> 10:12.564
Dad?

10:56.594 --> 10:58.311
Jesus Christ!

10:58.391 --> 11:01.141
- It's so easy!
- How'd you get down here?

11:01.221 --> 11:04.289
- The key was in the elevator.
- Oh, my God.

11:05.069 --> 11:07.993
I gotta say, this is not
what I was expecting.

11:08.373 --> 11:10.962
You said it was old but wow.

11:11.042 --> 11:13.365
I thought we were supposed to meet out front.

11:13.445 --> 11:15.533
Well, I got tired of waiting.

11:15.613 --> 11:19.349
- Where are you going?
- I'm having a little look.

11:19.429 --> 11:23.041
- Come back.
- God, the place just keeps going.

11:23.121 --> 11:25.877
Well, three generations
of Tildens keep expanding...

11:25.957 --> 11:28.513
...end up with this
state-of-the-art facility.

11:28.593 --> 11:30.682
Hey, come on.

11:31.062 --> 11:34.830
- What's the rush?
- I've been down here all day.

11:37.534 --> 11:40.525
You got to see me at my job,
why can't I see you at yours?

11:40.605 --> 11:42.854
You work at a book store.

11:56.086 --> 11:59.804
- Are these all people?
- Just three tonight.

12:01.225 --> 12:05.149
- Can I see one?
- Well, no. No. You cannot see one.

12:05.229 --> 12:08.020
- Why not?
- Because there's...

12:08.600 --> 12:12.090
- ...some things you can't un-see, okay?
- Come on, I can handle it.

12:12.170 --> 12:15.493
No. No. And my dad is way too strict.

12:15.573 --> 12:17.422
Try me.

12:18.942 --> 12:21.759
So, what'll it be?

12:23.080 --> 12:25.303
Are you serious?

12:25.383 --> 12:28.306
- Are you?
- Hell yeah.

12:28.386 --> 12:29.965
Pick one.

12:48.706 --> 12:51.429
Not that one. The one next to it.

12:51.559 --> 12:53.598
A body's a body.

12:53.678 --> 12:55.974
Yeah, well, I pick that one.

13:20.405 --> 13:23.308
- What's that for?
- To make sure he's dead.

13:23.742 --> 13:27.245
There used to be a time it was hard to tell
a comatose person from a dead one.

13:27.325 --> 13:30.585
So coroners tied bells
to everybody in the morgue.

13:30.665 --> 13:34.716
So if they heard a 'ting' they knew somebody
down there wasn't quite ready to go.

13:34.936 --> 13:38.167
- So, why do you have one?
- Well, I'm...

13:38.247 --> 13:40.365
...I'm a bit of a traditionalist.

13:44.428 --> 13:48.386
- Why did you cover his face?
- There wasn't much of a face left to cover.

13:48.466 --> 13:51.679
Point blank gun shot blast tend to do that.

13:51.759 --> 13:52.847
Who shot him?

13:52.937 --> 13:55.660
Angle of entry suggests he did it to himself.

13:55.740 --> 13:58.843
Until we found strychnine in his system.

13:58.923 --> 14:02.308
Judging by the progress it made through
his bloodstream he was already dead...

14:02.388 --> 14:05.216
...by the time somebody blew his face off.

14:05.296 --> 14:09.494
- Why would anyone do that?
- You sound like your boyfriend.

14:10.167 --> 14:15.260
Leave the "why" to the cops and the shrinks.
We're just here to find cause of death.

14:15.340 --> 14:18.312
No more, no less.

14:27.851 --> 14:30.185
You don't wanna see that.

14:31.221 --> 14:33.562
It's alright.

14:54.020 --> 14:57.068
Look who's easy now.
You should've seen the look on your face.

14:57.148 --> 15:00.623
I can't wait to see the look on your face
when you're not getting laid tonight.

15:00.703 --> 15:05.474
Hold on. Hold on. Not even if I ply you
with popcorn and sourpatch kids?

15:07.457 --> 15:09.674
You're lucky you're cute.

15:10.844 --> 15:13.060
How do you get used to that?

15:14.465 --> 15:16.681
You do and you don't.

15:19.536 --> 15:20.986
Sheriff?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.430
- Where's your dad?
- What happened?

15:25.510 --> 15:27.725
Bring her back here, Sheldon.

15:32.716 --> 15:35.173
- Dad, if you need me to stay...
- Oh, don't worry about it.

15:35.253 --> 15:37.501
You two go have your fun.

15:48.098 --> 15:50.422
Did you see the look on Burke's face?

15:51.002 --> 15:54.675
I mean, he wouldn't be here
this late if it wasn't important.

15:54.755 --> 15:56.250
- Here we go.
- Well, my dad...

15:56.330 --> 15:58.596
- There it is.
- I can't ditch him.

15:58.676 --> 16:02.994
So you're ditching me again.
What's he gonna do when you leave?

16:05.716 --> 16:09.307
- You haven't told him yet?
- No. It's not that simple.

16:10.721 --> 16:13.745
Babe. I'm gonna tell him, okay?

16:13.825 --> 16:17.859
Hey, you think I wanna be here? Down there?

16:17.949 --> 16:22.714
This isn't my life. I don't wanna be
Austin Tilden, the morgue worker.

16:23.734 --> 16:27.819
Just... he needs my help right now.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.994
Come on, it's been two years.

16:30.074 --> 16:32.456
He can take care of himself.

16:34.978 --> 16:36.701
Come back in a few hours.

16:36.781 --> 16:40.405
We'll catch the midnight show,
grab a drink at Thornton's.

16:40.485 --> 16:42.073
Two drinks.

16:42.153 --> 16:45.903
11 o'clock, I'm all yours. I promise.

16:46.623 --> 16:50.408
And don't, you know, don't smile
because a smile means "yes," you know.

16:51.328 --> 16:54.679
I know it's in there.
Now, you're gonna blow your whole game.

16:59.202 --> 17:00.852
Maybe.

17:03.657 --> 17:05.153
You're hot!

17:20.589 --> 17:22.946
Found her in the basement
of the Douglas' place.

17:23.327 --> 17:26.467
No ID, no fingerprints in the system.

17:26.696 --> 17:28.636
No one has a clue who she is.

17:28.716 --> 17:31.485
I don't suppose you know
how she wound up there?

17:32.036 --> 17:33.818
Stanley.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.439
Damn thing gets meaner by the day.

17:40.026 --> 17:43.284
Alvarez there was working
at Paul and Carol's place.

17:43.364 --> 17:46.067
My best bet? He killed our Jane Doe.

17:46.147 --> 17:48.006
Needed a place to dump the body.

17:48.086 --> 17:51.609
Didn't count the Douglas'
being home or Paul having a .38.

17:51.689 --> 17:54.345
First thing tomorrow, I'll bring him in
but for now she's the priority.

17:54.425 --> 17:57.808
Still, it would have been nice
to take a look at the crime scene.

18:03.827 --> 18:07.558
I got four people dead and no
goddamn clue how any of it connects.

18:07.638 --> 18:10.728
Nobody's pissin' in your grits here, Shel.

18:10.808 --> 18:13.230
But we do have protocol.

18:13.777 --> 18:18.496
Press is gonna need answers on this
in the morning and I got nothing.

18:22.085 --> 18:26.911
Now they'll buy a 10-79.
I can give them A, B and E gone haywire.

18:26.991 --> 18:30.174
But what I can't sell is her.

18:32.829 --> 18:34.786
Time frame?

18:34.866 --> 18:38.077
- It's gotta be tonight.
- Okay.

18:41.088 --> 18:42.874
You didn't have to come back.

18:43.573 --> 18:45.175
I know.

19:04.461 --> 19:09.821
<i>This is the autopsy of an unidentified
female henceforth known as "Jane Doe."</i>

19:10.001 --> 19:13.524
Performing the autopsy will be myself,
Tommy Tilden, attending coroner.

19:13.604 --> 19:18.563
I will be assisted by Austin Tilden,
certified medical technician.

19:19.143 --> 19:22.500
This autopsy will be conducted
in four stages.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.269
Beginning with an external evaluation...

19:25.349 --> 19:28.170
...followed by an internal evaluation
of the heart and lungs...

19:28.350 --> 19:31.676
...the digestive organs
and finally, the brain.

19:31.756 --> 19:34.478
<i>We've got some beautiful weather here
for the next few days.</i>

19:34.558 --> 19:37.633
Subject is in her mid to late 20s.

19:38.863 --> 19:40.685
Appears to be.

19:40.765 --> 19:44.422
Subject appears to be in her mid to late 20s.

19:44.702 --> 19:47.792
Caucasian. Skin appears normal.

19:47.872 --> 19:51.363
No outwards signs of bleeding or bruising.

19:51.943 --> 19:55.927
No scarring,
no distinctive external markings.

19:58.049 --> 20:00.537
Hair, brown.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.700
Eyes...

20:04.537 --> 20:06.187
...grey?

20:13.129 --> 20:16.497
You don't see clouding like that
unless a body's been dead for days.

20:20.536 --> 20:22.393
There's no lividity.

20:22.473 --> 20:25.703
No rigor mortis either.
When do you think she died?

20:26.143 --> 20:28.266
Well, she's colder
than the ambient temperature.

20:28.346 --> 20:32.203
- What, conditions at the scene?
- Could be confounding factors.

20:32.283 --> 20:36.384
Look how small her waist is. Like it
doesn't really fit the rest of her frame.

20:36.464 --> 20:39.043
Could be congenital.
We won't know until we open her up.

20:39.123 --> 20:42.206
Mark it down on the board.
We'll come back to it later.

21:09.819 --> 21:12.303
Her wrists and ankles are fractured.

21:13.256 --> 21:15.680
How do you break your wrists and ankles...

21:15.760 --> 21:18.388
...without any outward signs?

21:18.768 --> 21:22.159
- I see it all the time. Simple fractures.
- Simple?

21:22.519 --> 21:24.548
Her joints are shattered.

21:28.171 --> 21:30.461
What is that? What is it? Dirt?

21:30.541 --> 21:33.030
No, no, this is denser.

21:33.110 --> 21:34.821
Heavier.

21:35.613 --> 21:38.235
It's... this is peat.

21:38.315 --> 21:40.422
Haven't seen this stuff in ages.

21:40.952 --> 21:42.807
It's under her toenails, too.

21:42.887 --> 21:46.804
Yeah. There are trace amounts in the hair.

21:47.357 --> 21:49.581
She's covered in it.

21:49.861 --> 21:52.276
Like, maybe she was buried in it?

21:53.263 --> 21:57.255
- Where do you even find peat?
- You buy it at a nursery.

21:57.335 --> 22:00.584
But naturally in the ground...

22:01.171 --> 22:04.389
...up north. Not around here.

22:08.478 --> 22:12.323
Nasal passages, no sign of inflammation.

22:12.403 --> 22:15.586
No fluid and no foreign substances...

22:15.666 --> 22:18.286
...and ear canals are...

22:20.623 --> 22:22.339
...clear.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.035
I hadn't expected that.

22:31.117 --> 22:34.025
- Tongue has been...
- Severed.

22:34.105 --> 22:36.227
Crudely. Non surgically.

22:36.307 --> 22:39.130
She could have bitten it off, you know,
she ODs on something, tensed up...

22:39.210 --> 22:43.696
These aren't bite marks. See, striations.

22:50.920 --> 22:53.344
I've seen something like this before...

22:53.424 --> 22:56.347
...about 15 years back.

22:56.427 --> 22:59.977
Human trafficking around Norfolk.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.919
Two girls...

23:01.999 --> 23:04.689
...hands and feet...

23:04.769 --> 23:07.571
...bound tight...

23:07.651 --> 23:09.593
...to keep them from running.

23:09.673 --> 23:12.930
Cut out their tongues
for making too much noise...

23:13.010 --> 23:15.900
You think this was some kind
of a prostitution thing?

23:16.680 --> 23:18.323
Can't rule it out.

24:03.026 --> 24:07.208
Here, she has a molar missing
on the lower left side.

24:07.464 --> 24:09.680
Take some impressions.

24:31.921 --> 24:34.512
It's definitely some kind of fabric.

24:34.942 --> 24:36.807
Bag it.

24:37.112 --> 24:39.205
Send it to the lab.

24:59.984 --> 25:03.040
No external seminal fluid present.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.643
Give me a swab.

25:35.017 --> 25:37.309
She's torn up inside.

25:38.189 --> 25:42.545
There are ridges, grooves in the tissue.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.777
- Abrasions?
- No. Cuts.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.746
Deliberate.

25:54.604 --> 25:59.063
Severed tongue, shattered joints,
vaginal trauma...

25:59.543 --> 26:01.665
The theory tracks.

26:01.945 --> 26:04.428
We're barely out of the external.

26:04.781 --> 26:06.964
We got a ways to go.

26:16.859 --> 26:19.803
<i>We'll now proceed
with the internal examination...</i>

26:19.883 --> 26:23.313
...starting with the heart and lungs.

26:23.393 --> 26:25.599
Help me with the block.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.892
They're not supposed
to bleed like that. Right?

27:43.946 --> 27:45.970
I've seen it.

27:46.350 --> 27:48.329
But only on a fresh corpse.

27:48.719 --> 27:53.142
An hour dead, maybe two.
It's caused by a build up of pressure.

28:09.389 --> 28:12.640
What is that? Melanoma maybe?

28:14.143 --> 28:16.200
On the inside?

28:16.280 --> 28:18.001
Possible.

28:18.081 --> 28:20.564
Let's see what the lab comes back with.

28:30.726 --> 28:33.110
Can you hand me the rib cutters?

28:41.571 --> 28:42.934
Today?

28:58.755 --> 29:00.437
Shit.

29:04.494 --> 29:07.684
- What did you do?
- I got it.

29:07.764 --> 29:10.214
I need you to focus here.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.633
I got it.

29:15.872 --> 29:17.523
Well...

29:17.918 --> 29:19.595
...you were right.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.966
Her waist doesn't fit her frame.

29:22.046 --> 29:24.368
- It's not congenital.
- Then what is it?

29:24.448 --> 29:28.972
Well, if you wear one
long enough, a corset...

29:29.052 --> 29:32.331
Didn't those go out of style
a couple of hundred years ago?

29:54.977 --> 29:58.836
The lungs severely blackened.

29:59.416 --> 30:02.102
Wouldn't have taken her for a smoker.

30:02.252 --> 30:06.977
She could smoke ten packs
a day for 30 years...

30:07.057 --> 30:09.106
...wouldn't explain this.

30:10.793 --> 30:12.482
That's what killed her, right?

30:12.562 --> 30:15.485
No, this amount of lung damage, though...

30:15.565 --> 30:20.090
I'd expect the body to be covered
in third degree burns.

30:20.170 --> 30:23.804
It's like finding a...
a bullet in the brain...

30:24.790 --> 30:27.051
...but with no gunshot wound.

30:35.384 --> 30:37.541
Her heart's marked up.

30:37.721 --> 30:40.204
Almost like it's been cut.

30:43.292 --> 30:45.649
Well, not just her heart.

30:45.729 --> 30:48.752
What do you think that is? Genetic defect?

30:48.832 --> 30:52.456
- Probably scar tissue.
- Scar tissue?

30:53.136 --> 30:55.162
From what?

30:56.939 --> 30:59.096
Imagine all this internal trauma...

30:59.176 --> 31:02.099
...was reflected externally.

31:02.179 --> 31:04.401
Shattered ankles and wrists...

31:04.481 --> 31:07.838
...fire-burned lungs, scarred organs.

31:07.918 --> 31:11.442
- What would she look like?
- She'd be mangled.

31:12.022 --> 31:14.475
Disfigured beyond recognition...

31:14.555 --> 31:16.324
...but she's not.

31:18.060 --> 31:21.345
I mean, how the hell do you even do this?

31:27.970 --> 31:32.796
If you wanna kill someone, you shoot them
or poison them or drown them.

31:32.876 --> 31:34.731
A million easy ways.

31:34.811 --> 31:36.900
You don't go to these lengths...

31:36.980 --> 31:41.038
...unless you wanna make them suffer.

31:47.924 --> 31:50.808
- What the...
- I'll get it.

32:22.842 --> 32:24.892
So clean.

33:07.370 --> 33:09.586
What happened to you?

34:54.043 --> 34:56.099
What the hell happened?

34:56.179 --> 34:59.530
- Are you okay?
- Something's in the vent.

35:04.420 --> 35:06.069
Thanks.

35:11.994 --> 35:14.044
Oh, shit.

36:46.739 --> 36:48.722
Give me a minute.

37:37.606 --> 37:39.623
What are you doing?

37:40.442 --> 37:42.266
The drawer...

37:42.996 --> 37:45.312
...must have not closed it all the way.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.426
Stanley was a pain in the ass.

37:56.726 --> 37:58.849
But he was your mother's.

37:58.929 --> 38:01.745
One of the few things of hers I had left.

38:03.265 --> 38:07.280
- Yeah, I miss her, too.
- Right. Let's keep going.

38:10.457 --> 38:14.874
This is stage three
of the autopsy of Jane Doe.

38:14.960 --> 38:19.046
Beginning with the stomach
and the gastro-intestinal system.

38:24.036 --> 38:26.994
Dad, you can talk to me.

38:27.524 --> 38:29.947
I'm not keeping anything from you.

38:30.327 --> 38:34.744
You just... you put up this act for people...

38:35.431 --> 38:37.314
I'm fine.

38:40.169 --> 38:41.862
Alright.

38:53.882 --> 38:55.932
What is that?

38:56.986 --> 38:58.869
A flower?

39:17.006 --> 39:19.896
Jimson weed. Paralyzing agent.

39:20.276 --> 39:23.993
Probably explains
the inflammation on her organs.

39:26.046 --> 39:28.131
Here's a weird thing.

39:36.725 --> 39:39.948
That settles it. She's from up north.

39:40.028 --> 39:41.930
Yeah, but how did she end up here?

39:42.010 --> 39:46.016
One thing at a time.
I'm just trying to make sense of all this.

39:50.340 --> 39:53.596
<i>Gusts are now being reported
at up to 60 miles per hour.</i>

39:53.676 --> 39:56.566
<i>Rain is expected to top
three inches within the hour.</i>

39:56.646 --> 39:59.970
<i>This one might be a bigger deal
than we were led to believe.</i>

40:00.050 --> 40:05.135
Dad, how about we just...
finish this in the morning?

40:06.141 --> 40:08.411
Burke needs a COD tonight.

40:08.791 --> 40:10.814
We're not even close.

40:11.794 --> 40:15.358
When we start something, we finish it.

40:16.098 --> 40:18.274
You wanna leave...

40:18.354 --> 40:19.983
...leave.

41:11.286 --> 41:14.877
It looks like some kind of shroud.

41:15.343 --> 41:17.214
And old.

41:17.594 --> 41:19.649
Stomach acids should have
dissolved this thing.

41:19.729 --> 41:24.080
I mean, the fact that it's intact
at all is amazing.

41:26.268 --> 41:28.558
Now see, what is that?

41:28.938 --> 41:30.687
Roman numerals?

41:49.958 --> 41:51.481
Okay.

41:51.561 --> 41:53.950
These numerals.

41:54.330 --> 41:58.021
The order. T and... and this S.

41:58.101 --> 41:59.983
It doesn't fit.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.804
What are you doing?

42:24.092 --> 42:28.645
Someone pulled out her tooth, wrapped it
in fabric and forced her to swallow it.

42:29.765 --> 42:31.154
And the drawing?

42:31.234 --> 42:34.424
I don't know. Religious?
Possibly... ritualistic?

42:34.504 --> 42:36.780
Well, let's play that one out.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.462
Every ritual has its purpose.

42:39.742 --> 42:42.165
What MO have we seen so far?

42:42.245 --> 42:44.634
First they bound her.

42:44.714 --> 42:46.543
Then they ripped out her tongue...

42:46.623 --> 42:49.282
...poisoned her, paralyzed her...

42:49.362 --> 42:51.507
...forced her to swallow the cloth.

42:51.587 --> 42:53.228
Then the cuts...

42:53.308 --> 42:57.498
...the internal mutilation, stabs.

42:58.047 --> 43:01.778
Then as if that wasn't enough,
they burned her.

43:06.336 --> 43:08.808
Almost like a human sacrifice.

43:09.972 --> 43:12.295
<i>I got to tell you,
we have serious weather reports</i>

43:12.375 --> 43:14.998
<i>coming in from all the monitoring
stations across the state.</i>

43:15.078 --> 43:19.462
<i>We've got a flash flood warning now in
full effect for all of Grantham County.</i>

43:21.450 --> 43:23.667
<i>They've got concerns about...</i>

43:24.720 --> 43:28.485
You can't kill someone this way
without leaving a trace on the outside.

43:28.925 --> 43:31.381
She doesn't even have a broken nail.

43:31.861 --> 43:34.417
If we could just find out
why she was tortured...

43:34.497 --> 43:39.062
Down here, if you can't see it,
touch it, it doesn't matter.

43:39.702 --> 43:43.593
Now, these bodies are not just CODs, Dad.

43:43.673 --> 43:45.928
This happened to her for a reason.

43:46.008 --> 43:50.727
<i>Trust me when I tell you, this is not
a storm you wanna get caught in, folks.</i>

43:55.384 --> 43:59.402
<i>One thing's for sure.
You're not going anywhere.</i>

44:13.503 --> 44:15.385
Hey, Dad?

44:18.341 --> 44:20.824
I think maybe we should get out of here.

44:39.362 --> 44:41.411
Help me with this.

45:03.085 --> 45:04.634
Holy shit.

45:40.590 --> 45:42.805
What the fuck?

45:46.261 --> 45:48.618
Dad? Dad?

45:48.698 --> 45:50.413
Here!

46:05.480 --> 46:07.697
Let's get the fuck out of here.

46:18.593 --> 46:21.144
Come on, come on.

46:29.771 --> 46:31.821
The generator.

46:37.699 --> 46:39.842
There's not enough power.

46:52.894 --> 46:54.880
It's stuck.

46:54.960 --> 46:58.328
Help me with this. Help me with this!

47:03.071 --> 47:05.531
The old sycamore fell.

47:11.830 --> 47:13.419
Fuck!

47:13.499 --> 47:16.179
The office. The landline.

47:48.984 --> 47:52.061
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

47:54.022 --> 47:56.038
Thank God.

47:58.093 --> 47:59.982
<i>Grantham County, Sheriff...</i>

48:00.062 --> 48:02.868
This is Tommy Tilden.
It's an emergency. We need help.

48:02.948 --> 48:06.215
- <i>Sorry, I've trouble hearing...</i>
- Put Burke on the line.

48:09.404 --> 48:10.526
<i>This is Burke.</i>

48:10.606 --> 48:13.930
Sheldon, this is Tommy.
You better get over here now.

48:14.010 --> 48:16.999
<i>Hello? Tommy, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.</i>

48:17.079 --> 48:20.269
Sheldon! Sheldon,
we're trapped down here, godda...

48:20.349 --> 48:22.931
- Sheldon, please...
- <i>Tommy.</i>

50:01.349 --> 50:03.666
What the fuck is going on?

50:05.120 --> 50:06.969
It's her.

50:08.189 --> 50:11.013
Everything was fine until Burke
wheeled her through that door.

50:11.093 --> 50:13.883
- Son...
- Until we cut into her.

50:14.063 --> 50:16.579
You're talking about a corpse.

50:29.677 --> 50:32.101
These things we found inside her...

50:32.181 --> 50:35.404
...her injuries, those marks.

50:35.484 --> 50:37.850
You can't say she's just a body.

50:56.054 --> 50:58.178
We should have left.

50:59.408 --> 51:01.624
I wanted to leave.

51:10.118 --> 51:11.801
Dad!

51:19.361 --> 51:20.983
No!

51:21.063 --> 51:23.351
Dad! Dad!

51:33.608 --> 51:35.364
Dad?

51:35.471 --> 51:37.210
Shit.

51:49.325 --> 51:51.429
Oh, my God.

51:51.509 --> 51:53.431
Oh, my God.

51:53.511 --> 51:55.895
Careful, careful.

51:57.639 --> 51:59.322
God!

52:00.202 --> 52:02.784
- Help me up.
- Yeah.

52:05.473 --> 52:07.323
I'm fine.

52:08.910 --> 52:10.926
They were grey.

52:12.881 --> 52:14.697
Her eyes.

52:15.617 --> 52:17.800
It had her eyes.

52:18.620 --> 52:20.894
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

52:21.607 --> 52:23.389
It's her.

52:24.058 --> 52:25.581
Oh, no, that's not possible.

52:25.661 --> 52:30.680
No, her body those things we found
inside, those were impossible.

52:33.067 --> 52:35.558
Whatever the hell happened in here...

52:36.438 --> 52:39.222
...we are way past possible.

52:40.808 --> 52:42.558
It's her.

52:45.280 --> 52:48.698
So, what do we do?

54:03.224 --> 54:06.249
- Rapid decomp.
- Everything we took out of her.

54:09.297 --> 54:12.221
That's almost like her body
was preserving it.

54:12.601 --> 54:15.237
Must get her to the crematorium.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.952
Fuck it.

55:57.668 --> 55:59.421
Jesus!

56:03.244 --> 56:05.424
Behind you, the extinguisher.

56:07.315 --> 56:09.638
The pin. Pull the pin.

56:36.093 --> 56:37.396
No.

56:47.788 --> 56:49.638
The elevator.

57:20.455 --> 57:22.304
Come on.

57:26.327 --> 57:28.130
No, no, no, no! Fuck!

58:05.432 --> 58:07.484
Come on.

58:07.564 --> 58:09.219
Come on.

58:10.205 --> 58:12.054
Come on!

58:41.068 --> 58:43.085
Go, Dad. Come on.

58:48.175 --> 58:49.991
Come on.

59:29.950 --> 59:32.541
Emma. Oh, no!

59:32.721 --> 59:34.710
Oh, no, no!

59:34.790 --> 59:36.716
Oh, my God!

59:38.292 --> 59:41.210
Oh, no! No!

59:43.197 --> 59:44.852
No!

59:44.932 --> 59:47.088
Oh, my God.

59:47.168 --> 59:49.184
No!

59:57.345 --> 01:00:01.697
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Austin...

01:00:15.963 --> 01:00:20.048
Austin, the elevator. Come on, now. Come on.

01:00:24.071 --> 01:00:25.888
Come on, son.

01:00:46.962 --> 01:00:48.710
Fuck!

01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:53.382
Fuck!

01:01:08.516 --> 01:01:11.019
I told her to come back for me.

01:01:11.986 --> 01:01:14.203
I told her to come back.

01:01:15.189 --> 01:01:17.439
No, you didn't do this.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.844
You shouldn't be here.

01:01:22.464 --> 01:01:25.898
All this is my fault.

01:01:26.168 --> 01:01:29.001
- You couldn't have known.
- Yeah.

01:01:29.671 --> 01:01:32.194
Yeah, that's what everyone told me...

01:01:32.274 --> 01:01:34.369
...about your mom.

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:42.097
You know why I used to call her Ray?

01:01:44.452 --> 01:01:46.725
Ray of sunshine.

01:01:48.556 --> 01:01:51.072
She thought it was corny as shit.

01:01:51.593 --> 01:01:53.608
But it stuck.

01:01:56.997 --> 01:02:00.079
If I'd have known, I would've helped her.
You know that, don't you?

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.519
I mean, she was always so bright.

01:02:05.105 --> 01:02:06.955
So happy.

01:02:07.575 --> 01:02:10.465
To think she was carrying around all that...

01:02:10.545 --> 01:02:13.669
...pain, all that unhappiness every day.

01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:17.983
I should've seen it. But I didn't.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.438
She had to deal with it alone.

01:02:25.643 --> 01:02:28.060
All these mistakes...

01:02:28.863 --> 01:02:31.080
...my mistakes...

01:02:34.502 --> 01:02:36.719
...and you had to pay for them.

01:03:09.303 --> 01:03:11.610
Why hasn't she killed us yet?

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:14.179
Well, it's not for want of trying.

01:03:14.759 --> 01:03:17.085
Well, look what she can do...

01:03:18.312 --> 01:03:20.562
...if she wanted us dead.

01:03:25.419 --> 01:03:27.709
When we cut into her...

01:03:27.989 --> 01:03:30.612
...she tried to stop us each time.

01:03:30.992 --> 01:03:34.777
It's like there's something
she doesn't want us to find.

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:54.600
- You wanna go back in there?
- If we stay here, we're dead.

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:57.733
If we could just figure out how she died...

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:03.989
...maybe we can figure out how to stop her.

01:05:15.229 --> 01:05:17.459
- Dad?
- Right behind you.

01:05:18.899 --> 01:05:20.749
Keep moving.

01:05:27.319 --> 01:05:28.807
Austin?

01:05:33.048 --> 01:05:34.613
Dad?

01:05:35.649 --> 01:05:37.432
No!

01:05:40.587 --> 01:05:42.337
Dad?

01:05:58.589 --> 01:06:01.019
Dad. Dad.

01:06:01.209 --> 01:06:03.635
Come on. Come on.

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:27.315
Come on.

01:06:35.275 --> 01:06:36.992
Okay.

01:07:04.037 --> 01:07:07.242
Brain... is normal.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:10.132
There's got to be something.

01:07:10.945 --> 01:07:13.695
All her other organs are scarred.

01:07:35.502 --> 01:07:38.184
- What the fuck?
- What is it?

01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:00.602
That's why we couldn't find cause of death.

01:08:04.798 --> 01:08:06.882
She's still alive.

01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:09.684
Alive?

01:08:10.404 --> 01:08:12.928
We lit her on fire.

01:08:13.508 --> 01:08:15.857
We took out her heart.

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:21.069
There's something, some energy.

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:24.316
Call it what you want,
something is keeping her going.

01:08:43.053 --> 01:08:45.037
What the...

01:08:51.678 --> 01:08:53.495
Leviticus.

01:08:57.884 --> 01:08:59.968
Let me see that.

01:09:03.122 --> 01:09:04.973
Leviticus.

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:08.760
Twenty. Twenty seven.

01:09:17.203 --> 01:09:20.046
If these are Roman numerals then they'd be...

01:09:27.314 --> 01:09:29.531
...1693.

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:34.341
"Any man or woman
who consults the spirits of the dead..."

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:37.733
"...shall be put to death for they are..."

01:09:42.242 --> 01:09:43.515
Dad.

01:09:45.366 --> 01:09:47.354
Seventeenth century.

01:09:47.435 --> 01:09:49.451
North east.

01:09:51.971 --> 01:09:53.877
New England.

01:10:03.684 --> 01:10:05.560
"They are a witch..."

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.914
"...and their blood shall be
on their own heads."

01:10:17.664 --> 01:10:19.488
It fits.

01:10:20.318 --> 01:10:22.510
Witches are a myth.

01:10:24.004 --> 01:10:26.761
You can't keep denying.

01:10:26.841 --> 01:10:29.291
There were no witches in Salem.

01:10:29.876 --> 01:10:32.867
They were kids. Young girls.

01:10:32.947 --> 01:10:35.170
Falsely accused, wrapped up in hysteria...

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:37.538
...one pointing to the next,
who pointed to the next...

01:10:37.618 --> 01:10:40.835
...but they were all, all innocent.

01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:44.182
Only...

01:10:44.562 --> 01:10:46.223
...they didn't hang her...

01:10:46.427 --> 01:10:48.676
...or burn her at the stake.

01:10:49.096 --> 01:10:51.213
They tortured her...

01:10:52.766 --> 01:10:56.325
- ...mercilessly.
- The ritual...

01:10:57.405 --> 01:10:59.420
didn't work.

01:11:13.119 --> 01:11:14.936
What if...

01:11:15.755 --> 01:11:20.038
What if the ritual,
performed on an innocent...

01:11:20.118 --> 01:11:22.610
...accidentally created...

01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:25.736
...the very thing we're trying to destroy?

01:11:27.634 --> 01:11:29.757
Everything they did to her.

01:11:29.837 --> 01:11:32.087
Everything we've done to her.

01:11:32.973 --> 01:11:34.973
She can feel it.

01:11:38.645 --> 01:11:41.386
She wants us...

01:11:41.959 --> 01:11:44.684
...to feel it too.

01:11:51.692 --> 01:11:54.109
That's why she's keeping us alive.

01:11:58.665 --> 01:12:00.349
This is her revenge.

01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:05.274
This is...

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:06.766
...her ritual.

01:12:10.811 --> 01:12:12.700
But why us?

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.970
Why the Douglas'? Why anybody?

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:19.968
We're on her path, that's all.
We were just stops along the way.

01:12:21.521 --> 01:12:24.178
Those who survived got rid of her...

01:12:24.258 --> 01:12:26.684
...and buried her as far away as possible.

01:12:26.993 --> 01:12:28.880
That hasn't stopped her.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.947
Because no one got close enough.

01:12:33.733 --> 01:12:36.578
No one could see...

01:12:37.058 --> 01:12:39.080
...what we have seen.

01:12:45.946 --> 01:12:48.065
She's still suffering...

01:12:49.516 --> 01:12:51.733
...and it won't stop.

01:12:52.786 --> 01:12:54.872
It won't stop until...

01:12:55.222 --> 01:12:56.905
Until what?

01:13:00.327 --> 01:13:03.114
Dad, until what?

01:13:15.776 --> 01:13:17.865
I won't fight you.

01:13:17.945 --> 01:13:19.395
But please...

01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:23.775
...please don't hurt him.

01:13:24.518 --> 01:13:26.962
- Let me help you.
- Dad!

01:13:58.235 --> 01:13:59.951
Dad?

01:14:03.323 --> 01:14:04.546
No!

01:14:05.725 --> 01:14:07.071
Dad!

01:14:59.997 --> 01:15:01.566
Dad.

01:15:12.192 --> 01:15:13.905
No.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:22.033
Please.

01:15:23.603 --> 01:15:25.004
Please.

01:15:26.172 --> 01:15:27.889
Please.

01:16:46.486 --> 01:16:47.919
Tommy!

01:16:48.289 --> 01:16:50.645
Austin! Are you there?

01:16:50.725 --> 01:16:52.406
Burke?

01:16:56.896 --> 01:16:59.085
Anyone there?

01:16:59.165 --> 01:17:00.915
Burke.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.985
Austin!

01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:09.964
Austin! Are you down there?

01:17:10.044 --> 01:17:13.367
We're sawing down a tree blocking your door.

01:17:13.447 --> 01:17:15.963
We'll be with you right now, alright?

01:17:23.089 --> 01:17:25.379
- Austin!
- I'm here!

01:17:25.459 --> 01:17:27.381
Almost there.

01:17:27.461 --> 01:17:30.948
You'll be alright. Just open up the door now.

01:17:31.028 --> 01:17:32.920
- It's stuck.
- Try again, son.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.282
I can't. It won't.

01:17:35.935 --> 01:17:37.478
Should open up now.

01:17:37.558 --> 01:17:40.059
- It won't.
- Should open up.

01:17:40.139 --> 01:17:42.668
- I'm trying. It's stuck.
- Open up.

01:17:43.678 --> 01:17:46.000
- I can't.
- Open up!

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.629
I can't.

01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:50.223
<i>Open up your heart</i>

01:17:50.303 --> 01:17:53.884
<i>And let the sunshine in</i>

01:17:54.264 --> 01:17:58.551
<i>So let the sunshine in</i>

01:17:58.631 --> 01:18:01.332
<i>Face it with a grin</i>

01:18:01.412 --> 01:18:04.472
<i>Smilers never lose</i>

01:18:04.552 --> 01:18:06.990
<i>Frowners never win</i>

01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:10.920
<i>So let the sunshine in</i>

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:17.525
No obvious signs of forced entry.
Looks an awful lot like he...

01:19:17.605 --> 01:19:19.921
I've known his family 20 years.

01:19:21.074 --> 01:19:23.357
Whatever it looks like, that ain't it.

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:28.002
<i>Well, it's going to be
another nice one out there.</i>

01:19:28.082 --> 01:19:32.039
<i>Today's our fourth straight day
of sunshine. Looking at a high of 75.</i>

01:19:32.319 --> 01:19:35.803
<i>Beautiful outdoor weather,
but remember to use your sunscreen.</i>

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:42.660
What the hell happened here?

01:19:50.303 --> 01:19:52.553
What do you want to do with her?

01:19:52.939 --> 01:19:54.210
Get her out of here.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:57.498
Already got a car waiting.
There's that funeral home over in Ruxton.

01:19:57.578 --> 01:19:59.600
Get her out of my county.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.002
Take her over to VCU.

01:20:02.082 --> 01:20:04.565
Let Ward Lamon deal with her.

01:20:52.398 --> 01:20:55.626
Now, baby, listen, that was one time.

01:20:56.336 --> 01:20:57.625
Hell, yes, that's a promise.

01:20:57.705 --> 01:21:01.557
<i>And you know what Hebrews chapter four
says "the word of God is powerful."</i>
