00:15.800 --> 00:18.360
Yeah. Mixing "with" a lighter,
but that's still good.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.720
-You seem chirpy today.
-Yeah, very chirpy, actually.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.600
Let's just say, things
are gonna change around here.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.800
What, are you gonna finish
doing them curtains?

00:27.840 --> 00:32.040
They're fine. I've stuck 'em
up already with some tape on it.

00:32.080 --> 00:35.640
Well, go on then,
what is it? Well...

00:35.680 --> 00:38.960
I've gotta get something sorted,
but all I will say...

00:39.000 --> 00:42.120
is that it is something
you've always dreamed of.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.480
See you later, girls.

00:44.520 --> 00:48.080
What?!
Has he said something to you?

00:49.920 --> 00:52.800
I'm not taking you to school
until you tell me.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.760
So many thoughts in my head
right now, it's just...

00:59.800 --> 01:03.200
My mind is just seeing images,
you know?

01:03.240 --> 01:06.880
It's like I can see the
future and I see potential.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.800
-Shall we tell them?
-Go on.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.240
Basically, I can
exclusively reveal

01:13.280 --> 01:16.040
that Chabsie has opened up
his own nightclub,

01:16.080 --> 01:20.160
and we are gonna be having
our own very first
club night, called...

01:20.200 --> 01:23.040
the Kurupt FM
Champagne Steam Rooms.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.120
-Grindah thought of the name.
Fucking genius.
-Yeah.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.880
Just working on the flyers.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.760
[Grindah] If you go about
promoting your night, right,

01:34.800 --> 01:37.960
you're laughing, mate,
financially and physically.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.040
I mean, start off small
and then you don't know
where you will end up.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.880
It's not small,
it's gonna be big. It's gonna
be a massive, sold-out event.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.160
-Oh, has it sold out?
-Not yet, but it will be
by the time this goes out.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.280
-Stop...constantly.
-Sorry.

01:54.480 --> 01:59.440
-Easy you, man. So today's
the first day of our...
-[Craig] Dad!

01:59.480 --> 02:01.720
-..promotion campaign.
Hold on one sec.
-Hello?

02:01.760 --> 02:04.240
-Craig, I'm here, son.
-He's on the phone.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.320
The reception keeps cutting
out. I can't even hear you.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.919
Give me the phone, Craig.
You are such a mess!

02:09.960 --> 02:12.240
Why are you dressed
like a farmer?

02:12.280 --> 02:14.920
It's not you who has to deal
with it now, is it? Oh, right.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.400
Well, maybe next time just
don't get his hopes up
in the first place.

02:18.440 --> 02:22.240
You should see his little face.
You should.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.560
-It is little.
-[mobile bleeps off]

02:25.600 --> 02:29.600
Sorry, love. He says he's got
some work he can't turn down.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.800
Sure he'll take you
another time.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.480
Maybe, um...

02:35.520 --> 02:38.920
-I could take him if you want.
-Take him fishing?

02:38.960 --> 02:41.440
-Yeah.
-Eh?

02:41.480 --> 02:44.360
I've been waiting to do this
for so long, man!

02:44.400 --> 02:46.640
Just me and you out
in mother's nature.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.800
Just roaming the land.
Do you know what I mean?

02:49.840 --> 02:52.640
Like two albino bears
in the woods.

02:52.680 --> 02:56.000
Just like, making huts
out of mud

02:56.040 --> 02:58.480
and drinking our own piss.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.520
-What?
-Aren't you meant to be
doing something today?

03:01.560 --> 03:04.640
Oh, fuck, yeah! Starting
the promotion's campaign.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.240
Put it on ice. I'll call
Grindah. He'll understand.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.520
He knows how much
you lot mean to me.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.240
[Chabuds] What up?
Grindah, how you doing?

03:15.280 --> 03:17.880
I hope you lot like it.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.440
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God!

03:20.480 --> 03:23.040
Oh, shit!
What's that in my hand?

03:23.080 --> 03:26.360
I've actually added a bottle
of champagne by magic.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.800
Mini champers on the page,
classy.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.600
That's me there at the bottom.
Face a little bit covered.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.840
Chill out, mate.
It's not all about you.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.280
Okay, listen, boys,
I was going to ask, Deckie.

03:37.320 --> 03:41.040
Is it all right if you
give me a hand setting
up the club night and that?

03:41.080 --> 03:43.440
-What have I got to go do?
-Just a bit of light
building work.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.200
No worries. It's all good.
He don't mind.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.080
You boys okay with doing
the promo side of things?

03:49.120 --> 03:51.800
Of course, mate. Trust me,
mate. Me and Steves, yeah,

03:51.840 --> 03:54.600
we on this team spreading
the word like chlamydia.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.640
-The dream team!
-Fuck Beats, innit?

03:57.680 --> 03:59.840
-Fuck Beats!
-Fuck him.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.480
We're gonna be all over
Brentford estate.
Everyone's gonna know.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.680
-Champagne Steam Rooms...
-Oh, for fuck's sake!

04:05.720 --> 04:08.040
There's a hole in my bag.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.560
-Let's hurry up, yeah.
-Sorry.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.360
Has anyone got any jaffa tape?

04:15.840 --> 04:17.680
There you go, son.

04:19.839 --> 04:23.040
About to hit the road.
Bit of fishing.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.440
Oh, I love fishing.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.400
There's no room in the boot
cos of these fucking speakers!

04:29.440 --> 04:33.280
-You're definitely up for this?
-Yeah, hundred per cently.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.120
I spoke to Grindah.
He was a little bit fuming,

04:36.160 --> 04:38.760
but that's what it's about,
innit? Sacrifice.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.200
And right now, I need
to take my son fishing.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.000
-I am not your son.
-Stepson.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.480
And I'm his guardian, and right
now he needs me to guard him.

04:47.520 --> 04:52.760
[speakers pump out
loud drum and bass]

04:55.320 --> 04:57.400
It's this thing.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.960
See you later.
See you fannies in a bit.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.120
Kuruption! 108.9!

05:08.240 --> 05:12.640
I hope he was joking about
drinking his own piss earlier.
Wouldn't put it past him.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.480
-Bit of a mad morning for me,
really, Angela.
-Really. What's been going on?

05:22.520 --> 05:27.640
It's Grindah, yeah. He was
acting a bit weird this morning,
like sort of suspicious.

05:27.680 --> 05:30.960
-What do you think it is?
-I literally don't even know.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.480
Basically, he just said it was
something I always dreamed of.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.840
What have you always dreamed of?

05:36.880 --> 05:40.200
I do want to get a hot-tub,
but our bathroom's tiny, so...

05:40.240 --> 05:42.920
We've just got a bath.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.480
Oh, my God! Do you think that
maybe he's going to
propose to me?

05:47.520 --> 05:50.600
Cos we have been together
for, like, six years now, so...

05:50.640 --> 05:53.360
That would be amazing.
I hope it is that, Miche.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.280
-What do you think?!
-What? Like, I dunno, really.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.400
-What's happening?
-Basically, me and Angela think

05:59.440 --> 06:01.400
that my boyfriend's
about to propose, so...

06:01.440 --> 06:05.400
-No, I was just saying maybe--
-Oh! Congratulations!

06:05.440 --> 06:08.720
-Little Miche, getting married!
-Oh, thank you!

06:08.760 --> 06:12.440
-About time.
-Oh, God! This is mad, innit?

06:12.480 --> 06:15.360
Amazing! I love a wedding.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.640
Nah, I'm not annoyed at Beats.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.560
Like, doing the promotion
is something I'm probably
more suited for,

06:22.600 --> 06:25.000
my natural charisma,
do you know what I mean?

06:25.040 --> 06:27.840
Like, if he wants to do stuff
for his family that's
fair enough.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.200
Plus I had a go at him earlier,
so I got it out of my system.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.240
I'll show you how it's done.

06:36.280 --> 06:39.200
Hello, girl. Do you want
to come to a rave?

06:39.240 --> 06:40.840
-No, thank you.
-No?

06:43.320 --> 06:47.800
-Excuse me, do want to come
to a Kurupt FM rave?
-No, I'm all right, thanks.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.520
Not with me! I meant, do you
want to come to my rave?
Kurupt FM rave?

06:52.560 --> 06:55.480
-Hello. Thank you.
-Thank you.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.960
Are you into garage music?
Yeah, is it?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.880
-Steves mate!
-No, I mean, everyone's welcome.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.120
Steves mate, come here.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.880
-What the fuck are you doing?
-You said give 'em to everyone.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.280
Not everyone. They're
not even into garage.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.640
Sorry, you're actually barred.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.080
Don't talk to people any more.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.920
I'm going to hit the shops up,
so I can really connect
with people, yeah?

07:25.960 --> 07:28.720
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I'll see you in a bit.

07:28.760 --> 07:33.440
That's what I mean, man!
I've got my own club now.
I'm basically Tony Soprano.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.120
Decki, Decki.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.200
Decki, Decki. Chins up.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.040
Decki!

07:45.000 --> 07:48.240
Right, this is my super-club,
you know?

07:48.280 --> 07:52.360
My plan is to actually have
the champagne cocktail bar here.

07:52.400 --> 07:57.280
I want to use real sand
and inflatable palm trees,
you know what I mean?

07:57.320 --> 08:01.920
So I made this flow chart.
This is a few ideas I've
got for the club.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.160
-So you're gonna build it
out of this stuff here?
-Yeah, you know me, man?

08:05.200 --> 08:08.840
Never underestimate the power
of spray painting things gold.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.440
It triples the value instantly,
yeah. Check this out.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.760
A bucket. It's a normal
bucket, yeah? Now wait.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.200
Instant champagne bucket.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.320
-You still in London
when you're in Zone 6?
-Yeah.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.520
You see this? The soil
is actually fertile,

08:34.559 --> 08:37.880
which means that it's a good
area for animals to eat.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.640
You can tell, there's a lot
of footprints around here.

08:40.679 --> 08:44.039
-So there's been a lot
of activity. Fertile mud.
-Hurry up, man!

08:44.080 --> 08:46.560
Oh, well done.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.240
You found the water source.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.680
See that?

08:52.720 --> 08:55.600
That's your water source
right there.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.480
Follow that upstream,
whenever in doubt,

08:58.520 --> 09:01.280
to find the nearest
settlement of locals

09:01.320 --> 09:05.360
that will help you escape
to your nearest helicopter
evacuation point.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.800
Let's go!

09:10.320 --> 09:13.000
Do they have prawn
in there, Craig?

09:15.400 --> 09:20.640
Nature. Could be anywhere
in the world right now,
do you know what I mean?

09:20.680 --> 09:24.160
Thank you so much
for helping me, man.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.360
It's tough doing stuff
on your own, you know?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.360
-Being alone.
-It's cool, man.
Don't worry about it.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.520
Have you ever had your
heart broken, Decoy?

09:35.560 --> 09:37.920
What? No, not really.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.240
I mean...

09:41.280 --> 09:43.800
I never thought it would
have happened to me.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.480
In the beginning,
me and Aldona...

09:47.520 --> 09:52.160
our sexual chemistry was just
so intense, you know
what I mean?

09:52.200 --> 09:56.320
[sighs] We did some crazy
stuff together, you know.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.480
I mean, she was never
really into full sex, but...

09:59.520 --> 10:03.400
we did other stuff, man,
really disgusting,

10:03.440 --> 10:06.240
really filthy stuff, you know.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.120
-Even confusing at times.
-Shall we just get on with this?

10:09.160 --> 10:11.640
Let's crack on, come on.
No worries.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.640
Stop, stop, stop. Look.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.680
Just grab it, grab it.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.640
Look, unhook this.
Put your finger on there.

10:25.680 --> 10:29.720
Right, now keep it low as well,
cos it's a small river.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.240
And then just, as you swing
it round, release your
finger, like that.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.600
-Then lock this thing
back in place, okay?
-Okay.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.320
So gently...bam!
Release it, release it!

10:39.360 --> 10:41.840
And then just,
relax it down there.

10:41.880 --> 10:46.000
You see that? Man's
catching fish out here.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.520
-Shall a splash the water
to attract them?
-No, don't do that.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.680
Oh, fucking hell, man!

10:56.720 --> 10:59.520
Should have warn the high-tops,
innit, Craig?

10:59.560 --> 11:01.880
Fucked up my workouts.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.960
You're not supposed to splash.
It'll scare them off.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.400
How do you know so much
about fish?

11:07.440 --> 11:11.520
You're like that, um,
that little kid in <i> Free Willy.</i>

11:14.320 --> 11:17.400
Do you think if SeaWorld hadn't
trained <i> Free Willy</i> to jump
so high,

11:17.440 --> 11:19.920
he wouldn't have been
able to escape?

11:19.960 --> 11:23.240
-What?!
-I know. It's a proper
head fuck, innit?

11:26.920 --> 11:30.440
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You just dropped a flyer, mate!

11:30.480 --> 11:33.320
-You just dropped a flyer.
-I don't want it, bruv.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.640
Excuse me, mate. Can I put
these up in your window?

11:39.200 --> 11:42.200
Hello, mate. Can I put this
in your window for a rave?

11:42.240 --> 11:44.800
No, sorry, mate.
No, sorry.

11:44.840 --> 11:49.760
"No, sorry." Well, don't think
you'll be let in on the night.
I'll remember your face.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.080
Just finish that off, yeah.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.080
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.880
Great.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.440
[Miche] <i> I've been planning</i>
<i>my wedding since the</i>
<i>day I was born.</i>

12:00.480 --> 12:03.720
I just don't stop thinking
about it, just like
any girl does.

12:03.760 --> 12:08.560
<i>And I think, I just want
something simple on a beach
somewhere with white sand.</i>

12:08.600 --> 12:11.720
Ideally, I'd like to have
some white ponies involved,

12:11.760 --> 12:15.760
cos I think that's beautiful.
They're graceful animals and
they represent love to me.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.600
Yes, I'll probably just,
you know, go to the Bahamas

12:21.640 --> 12:24.920
and have a sort of bare-foot
wedding on the beach,
or something like that.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.400
Stay in one of those
well-nice hotels,

12:27.440 --> 12:30.440
where they fold your towel
into a little swan or a monkey.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.080
-That'd be amazing!
-Your boyfriend will
get there one day, so...

12:34.120 --> 12:36.640
-Oh, thank you.
-..no need to worry.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.960
Oh, my God!
Just everyone act natural.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.920
-Do I look all right?
-Oh, yeah, you look really nice.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.880
-He's waiting. Go on, go!
-All right.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.000
Give us the broom, Cinderella!

12:53.200 --> 12:57.920
Penny's dropped finally.
They've copped on to
who I am, yeah?

12:57.960 --> 13:00.000
-It's me. Yeah!
-You all right?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.800
Yeah. To be honest,
I had a bit of a mare today.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.400
But you know that thing
I was talking about earlier.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.720
-You're gonna say it here?
-What?

13:07.760 --> 13:10.080
-The thing you were
talking about earlier.
-Yeah. So, basically...

13:10.120 --> 13:12.360
Oh, my God.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.800
Kurupt FM are having
our own club night!

13:15.840 --> 13:19.200
-So was that the thing you were
going to tell me earlier?
-Yeah.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.280
You don't seem... It's my face!

13:22.320 --> 13:25.800
I was gonna see if you could
pop it in the shop window.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.200
So everyone can see it.
The other shops have been
mugging me off, recently.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.920
-I'll probably need to check
with my boss.
-Yeah, she'll be fine.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.960
-MC Grindah.
-Well, I'll see you later.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.560
Yeah, yeah, cool.
All right. Sweet.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.920
See you in a bit, yeah?

13:40.960 --> 13:44.160
-Go on, what did he say?
-Oh, no, nothing, like...

13:44.200 --> 13:46.800
He'll probably just, you
know, do it tonight, so...

13:46.840 --> 13:51.080
Oh, a wedding! I'm so excited!
I love a wedding! Do you
love a wedding?

13:51.120 --> 13:53.760
-You look really good together.
-Oh, thank you.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.760

14:15.760 --> 14:19.120
If you post a flyer with
a little bit of tape on it,

14:19.160 --> 14:23.920
then it will actually stick
to a letter and it will go
anywhere in the UK.

14:23.960 --> 14:28.880
You don't even know where it's
gonna go. You're basically
flyering all over the UK.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.800
[director] So did you put a lot
of the flyers in post boxes?

14:31.840 --> 14:34.240
Yeah, I put most of the flyers
in post boxes, yeah.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.800
I'll build a little Buju Banton.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.080
Don't tell your mum if
I let you have some of this.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.560
No, no, no. Of course.
Man code, innit?

14:45.600 --> 14:46.800
Exactly.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.640
<i>I do feel like his dad, yeah.</i>

14:50.680 --> 14:52.840
<i>I'm schooling him
about girls and life...</i>

14:52.880 --> 14:55.600
and that now, so,
yeah, definitely.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.520
Just give it a little tap down.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.760
<i>He's never called me
"Dad" to my face,</i>

15:01.800 --> 15:05.440
<i>but I know, in his heart,</i>

15:05.480 --> 15:09.040
<i>he wants to call me "Dad".
I can feel it, d'you
know what I mean?</i>

15:14.200 --> 15:16.680
I think we nailed it, brother.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.160
Just imagine, this place
is gonna be infested

15:23.200 --> 15:26.800
with the high-society
crème de la crème-lelle

15:26.840 --> 15:29.520
of Brentford's most
beautiful women,

15:29.560 --> 15:32.520
will be in here,
spending their money.

15:32.560 --> 15:36.400
High-fliers just waiting for
the right guy to come along.
Am I right?

15:36.440 --> 15:38.160
Yeah, man. Cool.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.920
Decki, I bet you get a lot
of chicks though, innit?

15:40.960 --> 15:43.440
-You must be smashing it hard.
-No, not really, man.

15:43.480 --> 15:47.120
Any spares you've got going,
send 'em my way, man.
Not a problem, brother.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.600
Cos I reckon we're similar
types, me and you.

15:49.640 --> 15:52.400
Two peas in a pod, you know?
Both obviously exotic.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.080
Both got the lovely
cocoa butter skin.

15:55.120 --> 15:59.760
-Obviously, the voluptuous lips,
you know? Both bi.
-Bi?

15:59.800 --> 16:02.640
Er, like, bi-racial,
you know? Mixed race.
Cos I'm mixed race, as well.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.600
-I'm half Pakistani,
half Indian.
-Yeah!

16:05.640 --> 16:09.000
[they laugh]
Is that funny?

16:09.040 --> 16:12.520
Oh, yeah! I guess I am
pretty... Jokes, yeah? So...

16:12.560 --> 16:15.000
Oh, man! This is great banter,
Decoy, man.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.800
We should chill more often,
man. What's your number?
I'll give you a call, man.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.800
-I'm going to be off, man.
-It's cool, man.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.760
We've caught one fish
in, like, time.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.200
I reckon if I wade,
just catch 'em.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.920
-I'm stuck in quicksand.
-It's cool. I've got it.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.560
When sleeping in the wild,
you wanna be elevated
off the ground.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.560
Cos predators...
You're an easy catch,

16:43.600 --> 16:46.160
specially if there's bears
or mountain lions.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.520
So best thing to do is
be propelled up.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.000
-Bye, you lot. See you later.
-Ooh, hold on, hold on!

16:59.040 --> 17:02.240

17:02.280 --> 17:06.359
Just a little something from

17:06.400 --> 17:10.160
Oh, wow! Thank you. I mean,
he might not even do it, so...

17:10.200 --> 17:12.880
We might have to think about
taking you on permanent
contract,

17:12.920 --> 17:15.800
now you've got a wedding
to save up for. Trial
period's nearly up.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.440
That'll be amazing.
Thank you, everyone!

17:18.480 --> 17:21.000

-Yeah.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.359

Look at her little face.
She's overwhelmed.

-Look at her. Ah!
-Oh, yeah.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.320
Well, I want every detail
tomorrow. Yeah, girls?

17:33.360 --> 17:36.520
We want to know all about it.
Have a lovely evening.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.000
-Good luck!
-Bye!

17:39.040 --> 17:41.800
Start planning outfits.
I love a wedding.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.720
Gonna have to buy
a fascinator.

such a great night for her.

-Oh, how did he propose?

23:12.840 --> 23:17.280
Well, basically,
he got down on one knee

23:17.320 --> 23:20.880

looked up and he said,

-"Will you marry me?"
-Oh! Was it romantic?

Cos that's where we do
our weekly shop, so, yeah,

<i>Cos obviously it
didn't come out of me.</i>

24:30.280 --> 24:33.440
I'm actually more mature
in my fashion sense as well.

24:33.480 --> 24:37.080
Obviously, you can tell
with the fleece.
I bought this when I moved in.

24:37.120 --> 24:42.040
This is a more mature look.
So it's what a dad would wear.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.760
I'm going more "Dad", even
fashion-based now these days.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.040
-Tell her what you caught, son.
-Oh, it wasn't anything.
Just a tiddler really.

round that part of the river.

though, innit?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.360
[director] Does Beats have
his priorities stretched?

24:57.400 --> 25:01.040
It's a bit irresponsible the way
he's, "Oh, I've got to do
my family and that."

25:01.080 --> 25:04.360
Beats should just be on point,
radio, radio, radio.

25:04.400 --> 25:08.840
That should be his life, cos
one day it's gonna make him a
millionaire off the back of me.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.720
Right, Kurupt FM radio meeting.

25:11.760 --> 25:16.120
24th of the... Like, whatever
the date is, basically.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.080
Deckie, my brother!

25:18.120 --> 25:20.040
-Full house!
-Ah, Mr Beats.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.800
Glad you could join us, finally.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.400
-What's happening, man?
-Nothing's happening.
Go and take your post.

25:26.440 --> 25:30.560
Right, the promotions,
obviously, ain't been
working, yeah?

25:30.600 --> 25:33.760
So we've got to think of
another way of attacking people.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.040
[Steves] I think I've
got something, actually.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.440
Subliminal messages
in the music.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.680
Lot of use that is, mate!
Just shut up!

25:41.720 --> 25:43.680
Quiet down, man.

25:45.720 --> 25:48.760
Mm. I was thinking
more of you, mate,

25:48.800 --> 25:53.160
-as you've done nothing
to the promotions so far.
-Yeah.

25:53.200 --> 25:57.600
[Grindah] <i> Basically, yeah, if</i>
<i>you want to promote yourself,</i>
<i>you've got to be out there.</i>

25:57.640 --> 26:00.720
On the ground, like,
handing out flyers,

26:00.760 --> 26:05.400
telling people what you're
about, showing them that
you're a bad boy MC.

26:05.440 --> 26:09.560
If we want people to love you,
then put the effort in.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.400
Don't just fuck about with
your family all day.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.920

-♪ Champagne Steam Rooms!

26:15.960 --> 26:19.160

26:35.760 --> 26:38.160
[Grindah] Easy brother, hold
tight the Brentford mandem!

26:38.200 --> 26:43.520
-Can I get back in the wheels?
-Just gonna spin it round
one more time, all right?

26:43.560 --> 26:47.200
<i>There are so many things
in my life, you know, uh,</i>

26:47.240 --> 26:50.040
perfume, weapons,
peanut dust.

26:50.080 --> 26:53.000
<i>But the hardest thing to
sell is humans.</i>

26:53.040 --> 26:55.760
Like being
at the beach, innit?

26:55.800 --> 26:58.680
<i>Not like in a human trafficking
way, that's pretty easy
with the right connections.</i>

26:58.720 --> 27:01.800
But like selling yourself,
self-promotion.

27:01.840 --> 27:04.280
The boys are out there
right now on the streets

27:04.320 --> 27:07.160
and they're selling themselves
and I'm proud of them.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.320
-Is it a rave, yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, it's our rave.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.040
-They fucking love it!
-The whole of Brentford
loves it!

27:15.080 --> 27:18.360
They're just staring at me!
They love it. Everyone's
looking at me!
