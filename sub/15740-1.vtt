06:12.774 --> 06:13.968
1 , 2, 3, hyah!

06:15.977 --> 06:17.376
Baby!

06:19.481 --> 06:20.971
Sassy!

06:22.484 --> 06:23.382
Studly.

06:25.654 --> 06:27.519
Check the pecs. Hee! Ha! Huh!

06:27.589 --> 06:28.715
Man, l'm pretty.

06:34.329 --> 06:36.820
Do the monkey with me!
Come on!

06:38.200 --> 06:40.760
Hey there, baby.
Oh! Uh!

06:40.836 --> 06:41.996
Yeah, whatever.

06:54.516 --> 06:57.451
NARRATOR:
The Aron city zoo...

06:57.519 --> 07:01.512
not necessarily
the most happening spot in town.

07:03.358 --> 07:07.294
lt's a rather peaceful haven
for those who want to relax,

07:07.362 --> 07:10.854
take a stroll,
or pick up chicks.

07:27.082 --> 07:28.811
Excuse me, mister.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.380
Excuse me, mister.

07:31.453 --> 07:33.683
Not now, kid.
l'm busy.

07:33.755 --> 07:35.484
Excuse me, mister.

07:35.557 --> 07:36.615
Now, look here, missy.

07:36.691 --> 07:38.682
l hope you don't take
this the wrong way or anything,

07:38.760 --> 07:42.787
but there's just too big of a generation
gap between the two of us.

07:42.864 --> 07:44.855
But all l want to know
is what time it is.

07:44.933 --> 07:46.230
There, there,
princess.

07:46.301 --> 07:48.565
l don't mean to
break your heart,

07:48.637 --> 07:51.071
but then again,
l'm a heartbreaker.

07:51.139 --> 07:53.573
How about a kiss
there, missy?

07:53.642 --> 07:56.076
Well, now that we
know each other a little better...

07:56.144 --> 07:57.076
Eat this!

07:57.145 --> 07:59.375
Ooh! Oh! Ooh! Oh!

07:59.447 --> 08:00.937
Baby!

08:02.217 --> 08:03.707
Oh, mama!

08:04.820 --> 08:07.653
l have to get going
now, sir.

08:08.857 --> 08:10.085
Women.

08:10.158 --> 08:11.682
Uhh!

08:11.760 --> 08:13.125
Hey! What are you
looking at?

08:13.195 --> 08:15.026
l've eaten chiliburgers
bigger than you.

08:15.096 --> 08:16.028
[woman screams]

08:16.097 --> 08:17.121
What the...

08:17.199 --> 08:19.326
[woman panting]

08:19.401 --> 08:20.698
Oh, man!

08:20.769 --> 08:22.703
l dig it when chicks run.

08:22.771 --> 08:24.705
[woman panting]

08:24.773 --> 08:26.707
Say, baby,
how's about you and l--

08:26.775 --> 08:28.208
Out of my way,
mister!

08:28.577 --> 08:31.137
Get off of me,
you son of a handbag!

08:31.213 --> 08:32.874
That ought to teach you
a lesson in manners.

08:32.948 --> 08:33.880
Huh!

08:33.948 --> 08:35.974
Now, that's
my kind of woman!

08:37.452 --> 08:39.385
Say, what's the matter,
little mama?

08:39.453 --> 08:41.717
Our prize gorilla
has escaped from its cage.

08:41.789 --> 08:42.722
Really?

08:42.791 --> 08:43.688
Really.

08:43.758 --> 08:47.660
Enough about you.
Let's talk about me, Johnny Bravo.

08:47.729 --> 08:49.560
What do you think?
Aren't l having a good hair day?

08:49.631 --> 08:51.064
Ha! Be brutal, mama.

08:51.399 --> 08:52.627
Excuse me?

08:52.701 --> 08:55.226
Why don't we grab ourselves a couple
of thick, juicy steaks?

08:55.303 --> 08:57.203
l know of a place
down the road.

08:57.272 --> 08:58.967
l don't think
you understand.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.302
What? Are you
a vegetarian?

09:00.375 --> 09:04.209
No. There's a 900-pound
gorilla on the loose.

09:04.279 --> 09:05.246
Now hold on, missy.

09:05.313 --> 09:08.908
A gorilla. 900 pounds.
On the loose?

09:08.984 --> 09:12.681
Ma'am, l'd be more than happy to help
you find your gorilla.

09:13.054 --> 09:15.648
You must be joking.
l mean, to capture a gorilla,

09:15.724 --> 09:18.818
l'd need, like, maybe
an army or a superhero.

09:19.227 --> 09:20.455
Superhero?

09:20.528 --> 09:22.223
Yeah.
That would be nice.

09:22.297 --> 09:24.231
Ma'am, today's
your lucky day,

09:24.299 --> 09:27.564
because l just happen
to be a superhero.

09:30.639 --> 09:33.972
You certainly don't look
like a superhero.

09:34.042 --> 09:35.907
Did l mention
my special powers?

09:35.977 --> 09:38.969
Oh, no. You didn't
mention those.

09:39.047 --> 09:41.277
Missy, you're looking
at the only man

09:41.349 --> 09:42.373
to have ever earned

09:42.450 --> 09:43.712
his black belt in every form

09:43.785 --> 09:44.877
of martial art in the world.

09:44.953 --> 09:45.885
What the...

09:45.954 --> 09:46.943
[heavy footsteps]

09:50.759 --> 09:53.751
Did l mention that l'm still studying
sumo wrestling?

09:53.995 --> 09:56.759
Hmm. You know,
come to think of it,

09:56.831 --> 09:59.197
l guess l could use
the help of a superhero.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.199
l knew it!

10:00.268 --> 10:03.135
You know, l have
a sensitive side, too.

10:03.204 --> 10:05.229
l can bring home
the bacon

10:06.675 --> 10:08.734
l can even cook

10:08.810 --> 10:11.404
l'll have
your gorilla back

10:11.479 --> 10:13.344
Faster than you can make

10:13.415 --> 10:15.349
A peanut butter
and banana sandwich

10:15.417 --> 10:17.282
And deep-fry that bad boy.

10:17.352 --> 10:18.284
Hyah!

10:18.353 --> 10:20.844
Uh...Thank you.

10:24.326 --> 10:27.193
Oh, won't you come home,
Bill Bailey

10:27.262 --> 10:28.695
Won't you come home

10:28.763 --> 10:31.698
l cried
the whole night long

10:31.766 --> 10:33.700
[humming]

10:33.768 --> 10:35.258
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:41.443 --> 10:43.377
You are the man. Ow!

10:43.445 --> 10:44.912
JOHNNY:
Excuse me, mister.

10:44.980 --> 10:47.175
Have you seen a gorilla hiding
anywhere around here?

10:47.248 --> 10:49.739
A gorilla? Hmm.

10:49.818 --> 10:51.752
Refresh my memory, babe.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.220
What exactly does
a gorilla look like?

10:54.289 --> 10:57.952
Well, they're, uh...
They're, uh...

10:58.026 --> 10:58.890
They're big.

10:58.960 --> 10:59.892
Big?

10:59.961 --> 11:02.725
Yeah. Big. This one's
about 900 pounds.

11:02.797 --> 11:03.729
My goodness.

11:03.798 --> 11:05.026
Yeah.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.226
What else?

11:06.301 --> 11:08.235
Yeah. Uh, they're...
They're big.

11:08.303 --> 11:11.739
And, uh...Big,
and, uh...Ugly!

11:11.806 --> 11:13.273
Yeah. Big and ugly.

11:13.341 --> 11:15.104
Hmm. You know what?

11:15.176 --> 11:18.304
l did see one of those gorilla
things about an hour ago,

11:18.380 --> 11:22.180
but he was certainly not
what l would have called ugly.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.683
Really?

11:23.752 --> 11:25.185
Oh, no, babe.

11:25.253 --> 11:29.485
He was more like
the Mel Gibson of monkeydom.

11:29.557 --> 11:30.455
Yeah, whatever.

11:30.525 --> 11:31.787
Do you know which way
the gorilla went?

11:31.860 --> 11:35.591
Forsooth, nay.
Alas, l looked away as he strayed.

11:35.663 --> 11:39.258
But hey, how about
l help you find this gorilla, babe?

11:39.334 --> 11:42.565
Mister, l don't think you understand
who you're talking to.

11:42.637 --> 11:46.539
l am Johnny Bravo,
the one-man army.

11:46.608 --> 11:48.098
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

11:48.176 --> 11:51.270
So you just stay out of the way and
leave the superheroing to me.

11:51.346 --> 11:52.677
No problemo.

11:54.949 --> 11:56.382
Did you see a gorilla
run by here?

11:56.451 --> 11:57.418
No.

11:57.485 --> 11:59.282
Did you see a gorilla
run by here?

11:59.354 --> 12:00.286
No.

12:00.355 --> 12:01.879
Did you see a gorilla
run by here?

12:01.956 --> 12:03.389
No.

12:03.458 --> 12:04.720
Did you see a...

12:04.793 --> 12:05.851
Gorilla?

12:06.327 --> 12:07.589
So l was wondering,

12:07.662 --> 12:09.630
you wouldn't happen to be
hiding any gorillas

12:09.697 --> 12:11.426
underneath them clothes,
would you?

12:11.499 --> 12:13.057
Ha! Huh! Huh!

12:13.768 --> 12:14.996
She wants me.

12:16.905 --> 12:18.338
[gorilla humming]

12:18.406 --> 12:19.634
Stick 'em up!

12:19.707 --> 12:22.938
What are you going
to do, arrest me?

12:23.011 --> 12:25.571
Will you be quiet
and get in the alley?

12:26.147 --> 12:29.207
Aren't we a bit
on the grouchy side?

12:29.284 --> 12:32.151
Give me your wallet,
you fat cow!

12:33.288 --> 12:34.880
What did you call me?

12:34.956 --> 12:36.355
Put down that gun.

12:36.424 --> 12:37.914
What the...Ah!

12:37.992 --> 12:39.516
Fat cow, am l?

12:39.594 --> 12:41.186
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners,

12:41.262 --> 12:42.490
Mr. Love handles?

12:42.564 --> 12:45.362
You are a p-i-g, pig!
Swine is what you are.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.866
Hey! Take it easy
there, kid.

12:46.935 --> 12:48.493
Your mama's so big

12:48.570 --> 12:51.164
that when she wore high heels,
she struck oil.

12:51.239 --> 12:52.069
Big?

12:52.140 --> 12:55.166
Your face is so ugly,
you could make an onion cry.

12:55.243 --> 12:56.437
Ugly?

12:56.511 --> 12:57.705
You are so fat--

12:57.779 --> 12:59.212
Now hold on, kid.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.771
That there wouldn't
happen to be the gorilla?

13:01.850 --> 13:03.841
Hmm. Could be.

13:03.918 --> 13:05.886
Sure is ugly enough
to be in a zoo.

13:05.954 --> 13:08.184
WOMAN:
Well! So there you are.

13:08.256 --> 13:09.689
Can l have my gorilla now?

13:09.757 --> 13:11.281
Why, yes, ma'am.

13:11.359 --> 13:13.293
l've got him
right...Here?

13:15.263 --> 13:16.230
Say!

13:16.831 --> 13:18.230
Don't l get any kind
of reward for this--

13:18.299 --> 13:21.097
A kiss, a date,
a hearty handshake?

13:21.169 --> 13:24.434
Reward?
l would go out with you,

13:24.506 --> 13:26.997
but it looks as though you've
already got a date.

13:27.075 --> 13:30.340
This is cute and all,
but l have a wife.

13:31.379 --> 13:32.346
What are you looking at?

13:48.396 --> 13:51.923
NARRATOR:
Deep in the darkest
jungles of Africa...

13:52.000 --> 13:53.991
No, deeper...

13:54.068 --> 13:55.535
Deeper...

13:55.603 --> 13:57.070
Still deeper.

13:57.138 --> 13:59.072
Now, darker...

13:59.140 --> 14:01.540
Darker...

14:01.609 --> 14:03.873
Well, maybe not that dark.

14:05.613 --> 14:08.047
[monkeys shouting at once]

14:08.116 --> 14:12.712
lt is here that one man reigns
over all he surveys.

14:12.787 --> 14:14.652
One man...

14:14.722 --> 14:17.156
Uh, boy.

14:17.225 --> 14:18.590
Jungleboy!

14:18.660 --> 14:20.389
Well, that was fun.

14:20.461 --> 14:23.953
ANlMAL:
Oh! Help!
Somebody help!

14:26.234 --> 14:29.294
The dam is broken!
The dam is broken!

14:29.370 --> 14:31.395
Oh! Jungleboy!

14:31.472 --> 14:33.963
l'm so glad you're here.

14:35.276 --> 14:37.642
Now, you just hold there
for a while.

14:37.712 --> 14:38.644
Bye-bye.

14:38.713 --> 14:41.238
l think l'm beginning
to wrinkle.

14:41.316 --> 14:43.341
Well, it looks like the day
has been saved again,

14:43.418 --> 14:45.682
thanks to Jungleboy.

14:45.753 --> 14:48.381
lt seems as though Jungleboy
has single-handedly captured

14:48.456 --> 14:51.220
the hearts of millions
here in the jungle.

14:51.292 --> 14:54.625
He is just too darn cute!

14:54.696 --> 14:57.096
Yeah. He's what all
my kids talk about--

14:57.165 --> 14:59.690
Jungleboy this,
Jungleboy that.

14:59.767 --> 15:02.361
He dammed up the river
using my butt.

15:02.437 --> 15:05.770
We'll have more Jungleboy
after these messages.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.432
Yeah. Yeah.

15:07.508 --> 15:08.975
Salon perm?

15:09.043 --> 15:11.102
No. Jungleboy!

15:11.179 --> 15:13.044
Jungleboy home perm.

15:13.948 --> 15:15.381
l was in an accident.

15:15.450 --> 15:18.544
Jungleboy got me
$6.5 million.

15:18.953 --> 15:21.285
TV ANNOUNCER:
See Brooke Shields
and Jungleboy

15:21.356 --> 15:23.620
in Escape to the Blue Lagoon.

15:23.691 --> 15:27.092
Hey! That was
supposed to be my part!

15:27.161 --> 15:30.096
Where's Rupert? Rupert!

15:30.164 --> 15:31.893
Yeees?

15:31.966 --> 15:34.662
Who is this Jungleboy,
and why am l not starring

15:34.736 --> 15:36.670
opposite Brooke Shields
in a movie?

15:36.738 --> 15:40.504
Because, your highness,
he's the man.

15:42.910 --> 15:44.104
Hello!

15:44.178 --> 15:47.113
Everybody's supposed to
love me, not Jungleboy.

15:47.181 --> 15:49.911
Where are my royal subjects?
My subjects still love me.

15:49.984 --> 15:52.077
My subjects!

15:55.356 --> 15:57.017
[laughter]

15:57.091 --> 15:58.752
Royal subjects.

15:58.826 --> 16:01.954
So then he offered
to pick all the bugs out of my fur,

16:02.030 --> 16:04.726
and naturally
l was flattered.

16:04.799 --> 16:06.460
Hello, girls.

16:06.534 --> 16:09.469
GlRLS:
Hello, King Raymond.

16:09.537 --> 16:10.902
Ooh!

16:10.972 --> 16:13.634
What kind of animals are you?
What's wrong?

16:13.708 --> 16:16.643
Look, girls! Aah!
lt's Jungleboy!

16:16.711 --> 16:18.645
But...Ooh!

16:18.713 --> 16:19.907
Hello, girls.

16:19.981 --> 16:22.973
[girls screaming
and talking at once]

16:23.051 --> 16:24.985
Thank you.

16:25.053 --> 16:27.578
l have to get going now.
Thank you.

16:27.655 --> 16:30.089
- Ahh!
- Ooh!

16:30.158 --> 16:32.149
Don't you girls know?

16:32.226 --> 16:34.023
He's a human.

16:34.095 --> 16:37.030
He's going to grow up
someday and kill us all.

16:37.098 --> 16:38.429
As if!

16:38.499 --> 16:39.932
Come on, girls.

16:40.001 --> 16:42.333
But...Ooh!

16:42.403 --> 16:45.338
Something needs to be done
about that Jungleboy.

16:45.406 --> 16:48.341
l need to expose him
for the evil creature he is,

16:48.409 --> 16:50.843
and l know just how to do it.

16:50.912 --> 16:52.675
[Raymond laughing]

16:52.747 --> 16:54.214
Let's see now.

16:54.282 --> 16:55.715
Peachy skin...

16:55.783 --> 16:57.114
Wig...

16:57.185 --> 16:58.675
Loincloth...

16:58.753 --> 17:00.778
No one will ever know!

17:00.855 --> 17:05.087
Now it's time for
Operation Hate Jungleboy.

17:06.594 --> 17:10.359
ALL:
Oh, look!
lt's Jungleboy!

17:10.431 --> 17:12.296
Oh, blow it out your ear.

17:12.367 --> 17:13.356
[gasping]

17:13.434 --> 17:16.961
Did you guys hear what
Jungleboy just said?

17:17.038 --> 17:18.300
[snickering]

17:18.373 --> 17:21.637
Reports have been coming in
from all over the jungle

17:21.709 --> 17:25.201
that Jungleboy has turned
into a stark-raving lunatic.

17:25.279 --> 17:27.304
l looked outside,
and there he was,

17:27.382 --> 17:29.316
just dancing around
in the underwear

17:29.384 --> 17:31.875
l'd just put out
on the clothesline.

17:31.953 --> 17:34.217
l'm just thankful
they were clean.

17:34.288 --> 17:36.222
While some couldn't believe
what they saw,

17:36.290 --> 17:38.986
most mammals
were just plain stunned.

17:39.060 --> 17:41.585
l'm just plain stunned.

17:41.662 --> 17:43.653
Jungleboy sawed
my horn off.

17:43.731 --> 17:47.326
He dammed up the river
using my butt.

17:47.402 --> 17:49.336
MARY ANTELOPE:
We'll have more
reports as this story breaks.

17:49.404 --> 17:51.338
Back to you, Nawanda.

17:51.406 --> 17:55.604
Let's see who's got it
going on now, Mr. Jungleboy.

17:55.676 --> 17:57.166
[laughing]

18:03.084 --> 18:04.574
[animals talking at once]

18:06.020 --> 18:07.612
Hello, animal folk.

18:07.688 --> 18:09.952
Look, guys.
lt's Jungleboy again.

18:10.024 --> 18:12.549
How dare he show
his face in public?

18:12.627 --> 18:14.458
Now, just ignore him,
and he'll go away.

18:14.529 --> 18:16.656
[whistling]

18:16.731 --> 18:18.198
Whatcha doin'?

18:23.604 --> 18:26.801
Oh! l can't look
at him.

18:26.874 --> 18:30.469
We can't stay mad
at Jungleboy.

18:30.545 --> 18:32.479
He's just a kid.

18:32.547 --> 18:35.482
He didn't know
what he was doing.

18:35.550 --> 18:37.040
[animals talking at once]

18:38.686 --> 18:41.553
ALL:
We're sorry,
Jungleboy.

18:41.622 --> 18:44.557
Can we worship and idolize you
like we did before?

18:44.625 --> 18:46.058
RAYMOND:
Stop!

18:46.127 --> 18:48.391
What's going on here?

18:48.463 --> 18:49.623
[gasping]

18:49.697 --> 18:52.131
Don't you know
Jungleboy's evil?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.668
He doesn't even recycle,
for crying out loud.

18:54.735 --> 18:58.762
You said it yourselves.

18:58.840 --> 18:59.932
Oh.

19:00.942 --> 19:03.274
Hey! There's
two of them!

19:03.344 --> 19:05.505
ANlMAL:
But which one's
the real Jungleboy?

19:05.580 --> 19:08.014
Oh, l'm the real
Jungleboy. Yeah.

19:08.082 --> 19:09.515
He's an impostor.

19:09.584 --> 19:12.451
He was out there
trying to taint my name.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.454
You've gotta
believe me.

19:14.522 --> 19:16.456
Look how cute l am.

19:16.524 --> 19:19.118
Hey! My name's
Jungleboy, too.

19:19.193 --> 19:22.128
Oh, yeah? Well,
let's have a contest.

19:22.196 --> 19:25.859
l bet l can hold
a note longer than you can.

19:25.933 --> 19:30.700
Da

19:33.708 --> 19:36.700
There. l told you
l'm Jungleboy.

19:39.714 --> 19:42.308
Hey! Jungleboy
never wore a wig.

19:42.383 --> 19:45.181
Yeah. And he never
sang no opera, either.

19:45.253 --> 19:46.447
ANlMAL:
Hey, look!

19:46.521 --> 19:48.716
SECOND ANlMAL:
That's not Jungleboy.
That's Raymond.

19:48.789 --> 19:49.813
ALL:
Raymond?

19:49.891 --> 19:52.655
Nobody move,
or the kid gets it.

19:52.727 --> 19:54.160
Ooh! Ah!

19:54.228 --> 19:58.164
Mr. Monkey, l'm appalled
at your behavior.

19:58.232 --> 19:59.199
Hey, everybody!

19:59.267 --> 20:01.497
What do you say we
tar and feather Raymond?

20:01.569 --> 20:03.503
Aah!

20:03.571 --> 20:05.198
Get him!
Get him!

20:05.273 --> 20:07.332
RAYMOND:
Aah!

20:07.708 --> 20:11.439
So once again, Jungleboy
is the man of the hour.

20:11.512 --> 20:14.106
Jungleboy, you've had
quite an exciting day.

20:14.181 --> 20:15.614
How do you feel?

20:15.683 --> 20:17.150
Uh...Wet.

20:17.218 --> 20:18.276
Ha ha ha!

20:18.352 --> 20:19.444
Wet?

20:19.520 --> 20:21.283
Can you change
my diaper?

20:21.355 --> 20:22.879
Uh...Nawanda?

20:27.328 --> 20:28.386
ANNOUNCER:
Hello Johnny.

20:28.462 --> 20:30.054
lt's activity time!

20:30.131 --> 20:32.725
There's a rhino hiding some
where in this room

20:32.800 --> 20:35.268
can you find him before
the kids at home do?

20:35.336 --> 20:36.735
Hey, no problem.

Excuse me.

21:09.971 --> 21:12.166
Now, that was a beauty.

21:13.274 --> 21:15.037
NARRATOR:
Whale watching.

21:15.109 --> 21:18.272
Studies indicate that whale watching is
one of the best ways

21:18.346 --> 21:20.780
for man to get in touch
with himself,

21:20.848 --> 21:24.340
to get in touch with nature,
and to get in touch with chicks.

21:32.259 --> 21:33.351
Hey there, little lady.

21:33.427 --> 21:35.554
Do you mind?
You're in my way.

21:35.630 --> 21:37.120
Yeah, l know.

You smell kind of pretty.
Want to smell me?

21:49.377 --> 21:50.503
Hey, pepper spray.

21:50.578 --> 21:54.514
Don't they use that for--
Oh! Ah! Oh! Ha! Oh!

[woman singing]

22:24.779 --> 22:27.873
Hmm. That voice.

22:52.573 --> 22:54.063
Ahem.

22:57.044 --> 22:58.978
You want to see
my chest hair?

22:59.046 --> 23:00.570
lt's blond
and curly.

23:05.953 --> 23:09.445
Wow! She sure is
a whole lot of woman.

23:10.491 --> 23:12.152
What's your hurry,
missy?

23:12.226 --> 23:14.057
By the way,
l didn't catch your name.

23:14.128 --> 23:15.060
Get out of my way.

23:15.129 --> 23:16.289

23:19.366 --> 23:22.893
You know what? l bet your name's
Mickey 'cause you're so fine.

23:22.970 --> 23:24.460
You're so fine--

23:24.538 --> 23:27.905
My name is of no importance
to you, midget boy.

23:27.975 --> 23:31.103
l am an Amazon;
thus, l am a warrior.

23:31.178 --> 23:33.146
You have no right
being on this island,

23:33.214 --> 23:35.546
so be off,
or feel my wrath.

23:35.616 --> 23:36.947
Did you say
you're a warrior?

23:37.017 --> 23:38.609
Yes, l did.

23:38.686 --> 23:39.744
Want to mud wrestle?

23:54.902 --> 23:55.834
Yes, Melissa?

23:55.903 --> 23:57.336
See this?

23:57.404 --> 23:58.996
Make sure this
doesn't follow me

23:59.073 --> 24:00.802
back to the village
of beautiful women.

24:00.875 --> 24:02.103
Village

24:02.176 --> 24:03.700
CHRlSTOPHER:
Yes, ma'am.

24:03.778 --> 24:06.212
l don't even want him anywhere near
the village of beautiful women.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.611
Village

24:07.681 --> 24:09.308
Yes, ma'am.

24:09.383 --> 24:11.874
Huh! Did she say village
of beautiful women?

24:11.952 --> 24:13.385
Maybe.

24:13.454 --> 24:16.150
As in more than one
beautiful woman?

Mister, this is getting

mountains to climb.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.629
Oh!

Where do you think
you're going?

24:31.906 --> 24:33.339
Am l going to
have to fight you?

24:33.407 --> 24:34.635
Oh!

24:34.708 --> 24:37.176
Oh! Nice briefs.

24:37.244 --> 24:39.144
[Christopher humming]

24:39.213 --> 24:42.011
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

24:42.082 --> 24:44.983
Don't hate me
because l am beautiful.

24:45.052 --> 24:47.816
Take those tightie-whities

24:47.888 --> 24:49.651
Oh, all right.

24:51.725 --> 24:53.158
Here, crybaby.

24:53.227 --> 24:54.387
[Christopher laughing]

24:54.461 --> 24:56.395
You're going to pay
for all this.

24:56.463 --> 24:58.897
Oh! Ooh! Ah!
Ooh! Ah! Oh!

24:58.966 --> 25:01.400
Mr. Man,
don't get me angry.

25:01.468 --> 25:03.936
You wouldn't like me
when l am angry.

25:04.004 --> 25:05.631
Now it's personal.

25:05.706 --> 25:08.231
Oh. Scaredy you.

25:08.309 --> 25:11.938
Mister, it seems
to me that...Huh?

25:12.012 --> 25:14.776
Say, isn't that Don Knotts right
there behind you?

25:14.849 --> 25:17.784
Don Knotts? Don Knotts?

25:17.852 --> 25:19.342
Don Knotts?

25:19.420 --> 25:25.359
Hey! l hate it when people

JOHNNY:
lf you don't
get off of me...

25:52.820 --> 25:55.414
Did you let that imbecile follow you
back to the village?

25:55.489 --> 25:58.754
CHRlSTOPHER:
Well, kind of.

26:01.729 --> 26:03.993
Hmm. We're going to
have to take care of him

26:04.064 --> 26:05.656
now that he's found
the island.

26:05.733 --> 26:07.200
l could be
the town masseuse.

26:07.268 --> 26:10.169
Looks like we're going to have to do
the virgin sacrifice.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.831

massage courses in the mail.

26:12.907 --> 26:15.000

rubbing oil for everybody.

26:23.117 --> 26:25.517
Don't l get
a last request?

26:25.586 --> 26:27.486
You'll get nothing
and like it.

26:27.554 --> 26:29.488
Tell it like it is,
sister!

26:29.556 --> 26:32.252
Oh, great Athena,
we give you this virgin

26:32.326 --> 26:36.023
as a sacrifice
to your beauty and womanhood.

26:36.096 --> 26:37.586
Did she say virgin?

26:37.665 --> 26:41.362
And l ask that you bless
our plentiful land

26:41.435 --> 26:43.835
with great fortune and mirth.

26:43.904 --> 26:45.633
Excuse me, ma'am, but--oh!

We offer this heathen

Oh!

26:52.112 --> 26:53.670
Yeah, whatever.

Huuuh!

26:56.483 --> 26:58.883

28:57.416 --> 28:59.976
A loaf of bread, container of milk,
stick of butter.

29:00.052 --> 29:02.520
A loaf of bread,
container of milk, stick of butter.

29:02.588 --> 29:05.216

29:05.290 --> 29:07.554

Gee, Johnny,

29:08.627 --> 29:12.654

29:12.731 --> 29:14.722
Sorry, kid, l'm actually

29:22.307 --> 29:23.774

my teacher--

29:23.842 --> 29:25.776
Miss Babe.

29:27.212 --> 29:29.806
Miss Babe.

29:29.882 --> 29:31.816
And l could get you

29:31.884 --> 29:33.818

29:33.886 --> 29:36.252

29:36.321 --> 29:38.881

29:52.838 --> 29:55.238
Eeeewwww!

30:19.564 --> 30:22.397

30:22.467 --> 30:26.494
l've got a real thing for big,
strong superheroes.

30:26.571 --> 30:28.869
Wanna see me comb

30:28.941 --> 30:30.374
Hyah! Ha! Ho!

Yeah!
Now Bravoman can go

30:42.988 --> 30:46.185

powers.

30:46.325 --> 30:48.691
Oh, you will pay
for this.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.387
[siren]

30:50.462 --> 30:53.727
Uh, look, folks,
you're gonna have to step back.

30:53.799 --> 30:56.131
There's a robbery
going on in there.

30:56.201 --> 30:57.725
Yes, sir.
No problem, officer.

30:57.803 --> 31:00.271
Officer,

31:00.339 --> 31:01.499
He's a superhero,

stop the bad guys.

31:04.076 --> 31:04.906

You hear that,

31:06.478 --> 31:08.309
There's a

31:08.380 --> 31:11.042
Hey! Let's go get

31:11.116 --> 31:12.515
Yaaaaay!

31:15.787 --> 31:19.018
lt's Sweetcheeks,
the candy-powered villain!

31:19.091 --> 31:22.618
l just love a man
who stands up to super-villains.

31:22.694 --> 31:24.127
Stand back, everybody!

31:24.196 --> 31:25.128
Huh!

31:25.197 --> 31:26.824
Bravoman is here.

31:26.898 --> 31:29.423
[cheering]

31:31.103 --> 31:32.331
All right, hold it,

31:34.406 --> 31:36.806
KlDS:
Yay!

31:36.875 --> 31:37.807
Wow!

31:37.876 --> 31:39.605
Did you
see the way Bravoman

31:39.678 --> 31:41.077
just let
Sweetcheeks think

31:41.146 --> 31:42.670
he was getting away?

31:42.748 --> 31:44.807
You know,
you can stop now.

31:44.883 --> 31:47.647
l already got an ''A''
on my project.

31:47.719 --> 31:49.710
That was very brave.

31:50.722 --> 31:52.713
l'm gonna get you
an ''A-plus''.

31:53.959 --> 31:55.256
[laughing]

31:55.327 --> 31:57.727
What joy it brings me
to rob and steal,

31:57.796 --> 31:59.593
and generally do evil.

31:59.664 --> 32:01.325
Now look here,
mister--

32:01.400 --> 32:03.527
don't force me to
whip you right here.

32:03.602 --> 32:05.593
How about l
whip you?

32:05.670 --> 32:07.695
With my
licorice whip?

32:10.042 --> 32:11.202
Aah!

32:12.144 --> 32:13.509
Oh, good golly.

32:13.578 --> 32:16.513
Cool!
Sweetcheeks tied up Bravoman!

32:16.581 --> 32:19.846
Yeah! But Bravoman
totally escaped.

32:19.918 --> 32:22.011
[cheering]

32:28.160 --> 32:30.390
By stealing all
the children's candy,

32:30.462 --> 32:33.898
l shall have total control
over their snack time.

32:33.965 --> 32:35.398
Ok, candy boy.

32:35.467 --> 32:38.527
l didn't want it to have to come
to this, but--

32:38.603 --> 32:39.535
Hoo-wah!

32:39.604 --> 32:41.265
Aaaaah!

32:41.339 --> 32:42.567
[crash]

32:42.641 --> 32:44.836
Man, it's dark in here.

32:44.910 --> 32:46.172
[echo]
Dark in here,
Dark in here.

32:47.012 --> 32:49.071
Hey, Johnny,

32:49.147 --> 32:51.377
l lure Sweetcheeks
over to this hole,

32:51.450 --> 32:53.384
and you can beat him up.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.581
[crunching]

32:56.655 --> 32:57.883
[crunch crunch]

32:58.590 --> 32:59.716
Excuse me, sir,

32:59.791 --> 33:02.385
aren't you the evil
villain Sweetcheeks?

33:02.461 --> 33:05.726
l'll bet you're terribly frightened
of me, aren't you?

33:05.797 --> 33:07.162
Yes, sir, l am.

33:07.232 --> 33:09.894
But it would really scare me
if you'd just back up a bit

33:09.968 --> 33:11.060
towards that manhole.

33:11.136 --> 33:13.832
Very well, hee hee!

33:13.905 --> 33:16.066
Ho ho! Ha ha ha!

33:16.141 --> 33:18.075
Oh, man.
Now's my chance.

33:21.880 --> 33:22.812

33:22.881 --> 33:23.973
Aaaaah!

33:24.049 --> 33:27.780
Whooooooaaaaah!

33:27.853 --> 33:29.445
[crash]

33:30.455 --> 33:32.389
Aw, man, that does it!

33:32.457 --> 33:34.687
This is my favorite shirt.

33:34.759 --> 33:36.954

33:37.028 --> 33:38.518
Aaaah!

33:38.597 --> 33:40.064
Ha ha ha ha ha!

33:40.132 --> 33:44.193
As a token of my extreme hatred
for all people in the world,

33:44.269 --> 33:48.330
l shall change this child
into a large chocolate bunny!

33:48.406 --> 33:50.567
Aaaah!

33:52.110 --> 33:55.307
With an exceptionally
large caramel center!

33:55.380 --> 33:56.972
Aaaah!

33:57.048 --> 33:59.881
This thing ought to wash me up
pretty good.

33:59.951 --> 34:01.976

Whoa! Aah! Aah!

34:13.532 --> 34:17.059

Miss Babe?

34:50.635 --> 34:51.829

- Whatever.

34:51.902 --> 34:53.199
Hey, how's about me
and you go off

34:53.271 --> 34:54.898
and pick me out
a new costume?

34:54.973 --> 34:55.940
Huh!

34:56.007 --> 34:57.565
Oh, well, uh,

35:21.967 --> 35:23.264
Don't worry, Bravoman.

35:23.335 --> 35:24.927
You'll always have me.

35:25.003 --> 35:28.598
Use your heat vision!
Use your heat vision!

35:28.673 --> 35:30.504
On which one?

35:47.826 --> 35:49.316
NARRATOR:
When flying

there are only two ways to fly:

35:52.897 --> 35:54.296
first class...

35:54.366 --> 35:57.335
and no class.

35:57.402 --> 35:59.996
Actually, lady,
on some airlines it's a compliment

36:00.071 --> 36:02.596
to be called
an air waitress.

36:05.844 --> 36:06.776
Ooh!

36:06.845 --> 36:09.837
Man, them air waitresses

36:50.288 --> 36:53.223
That guy broke my leg!

36:53.291 --> 36:55.725
Hey!
He hurt Jungle Boy!

36:55.794 --> 36:57.728
Somebody needs
to do something.

36:57.796 --> 37:01.425
Yeah. We can't let him
get away with that.

37:01.499 --> 37:03.933
Hello! l'm poisonous.

37:04.002 --> 37:06.402
Ok, Phil, we know
you're poisonous.

37:06.471 --> 37:07.403
l am!

37:07.472 --> 37:09.133
Like, once, l bit my tongue

37:09.207 --> 37:11.232
and l passed out for,
like, 3 days.

37:11.309 --> 37:13.334
Everybody
who's poisonous,

37:13.411 --> 37:16.403
raise your arms
and hands high.

37:16.481 --> 37:19.041
l guess none of us
is poisonous, are we?

37:19.117 --> 37:20.982
Well, l might be.

37:21.052 --> 37:23.418
Who are you to say
who's poisonous and who's not?

37:23.488 --> 37:25.285
Yeah,

37:26.624 --> 37:28.285

Uh, hi, there.

Do you guys know where
l can find a phone?

37:34.766 --> 37:37.098
Get him!

37:37.168 --> 37:39.261
What the heck are you
so mad about?

37:39.337 --> 37:40.929
l'm not doing anything.

37:41.005 --> 37:43.997
Well, it looks like man
has gone mad in the jungle,

37:44.075 --> 37:45.303
this time in the form of
a tall,

37:45.377 --> 37:47.902
blond stranger named
Johnny Bravo.

37:48.012 --> 37:51.038
The animals have formed
a militia to capture this Johnny Bravo

37:51.116 --> 37:53.778
and bring him
to his final justice.

37:54.753 --> 37:55.811
Excellent.

37:55.887 --> 37:59.288
lf l can make the animals
hate this blond oaf,

37:59.357 --> 38:00.551
they will see Jungle Boy

38:00.625 --> 38:03.355
as a tiny version
of the oaf that hurt them.

38:03.428 --> 38:05.362
An oaflet, if you will.

38:05.430 --> 38:07.955
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

38:09.300 --> 38:12.599
We will not let this man escape,
but be warned!

38:12.670 --> 38:15.036
He is armed and dangerous!

38:15.106 --> 38:16.733
He has a gun?

38:18.576 --> 38:19.406
Oh, l'm sorry.

38:19.477 --> 38:22.913
l meant to say he's dangerous
and has arms.

38:22.981 --> 38:23.913
Oh, ouch.

38:23.982 --> 38:26.780
Rub it in my face,
why don't you?

38:28.286 --> 38:32.313
All l have to do is capture
this Johnny Bravo,

38:32.390 --> 38:34.415
and the animals will adore me.

38:34.492 --> 38:40.226
l will be the ape that captured
the man that hurt Jungle Boy.

38:42.567 --> 38:44.034
Hey--

38:44.102 --> 38:46.935
wait a minute.
This is a bear trap.

38:47.005 --> 38:48.097
l ain't no bear.

49:08.793 --> 49:11.523
Oh, isn't that
just darling?

49:11.595 --> 49:14.894
l should put
those boys to bed.

49:17.868 --> 49:20.894
Night-night,
you little dears.

49:25.609 --> 49:27.440
Aw, man.

49:27.511 --> 49:31.072
lt's gonna be a looooong winter.

50:11.288 --> 50:12.482
1 , 2, 3, Hyah!

50:14.491 --> 50:15.515
Baby.

50:17.994 --> 50:19.291
Sassy.

50:20.630 --> 50:23.565
Studly. Vroom!

50:23.633 --> 50:25.726
Check the pecs.
Hee-hi-huh!

50:25.802 --> 50:27.292
Man, l'm pretty.

50:32.776 --> 50:35.267
Do the monkey with me.
Come on.

50:36.646 --> 50:37.578
Hey, there, baby.

50:37.647 --> 50:39.080
Oomph! Ah!

50:39.149 --> 50:40.377
Yeah, whatever.

51:03.540 --> 51:05.599
JOHNNY:
Oh, mama!

51:08.111 --> 51:09.203
Hey, there, cutie pants.

51:09.279 --> 51:12.612
Huh! H'yah!
Ho! Ha! H'yah!

51:12.682 --> 51:15.515
Am l as studly as
the statue of David or what?

51:15.585 --> 51:18.782
l'd say you're
as studly as David...Brinkley.

51:18.855 --> 51:20.288
Do you honestly think

51:20.357 --> 51:22.917
women are attracted
to that kind of macho attitude?

51:23.293 --> 51:24.817
l honestly do,
sugar beets.

51:24.894 --> 51:27.055
Hmm. Astounding.
[slurp]

51:29.299 --> 51:31.790
Ohh, pressure.

51:31.868 --> 51:33.426
[ burp ]
Bu-bye.

51:35.839 --> 51:37.830
Oh, yeah,
she wants me.

51:39.342 --> 51:40.639
Pardon me, Miss.

51:40.710 --> 51:43.645
Gosh, l'm really not very good
at this sort of thing--

51:43.713 --> 51:45.943
l'm rather bashful
by nature, actually--

51:46.015 --> 51:48.779
but l find you
quite beautiful.

51:48.852 --> 51:50.342
Would you
go out with me?

51:50.420 --> 51:52.115
Oh, aren't you sweet?

51:52.188 --> 51:54.349
Of course l will.
Here's my phone number.

51:54.424 --> 51:56.415
Wait a sec.
That ain't possible!

51:57.727 --> 51:58.694
How'd you
do that, mister?

51:58.762 --> 51:59.694
Do what?

51:59.763 --> 52:00.991
Get that little chick's
phone number.

52:01.064 --> 52:03.430
She wouldn't give it to me,
and look at me.

52:04.567 --> 52:05.625
Huh?

52:05.702 --> 52:07.727
Well, sir, women
like a man with depth.

52:07.804 --> 52:11.570
When l speak to a girl,
l always express my true feelings

52:11.641 --> 52:13.302
in a sensitive way.

52:13.376 --> 52:14.308
- What?
- Beg your pardon?

52:14.377 --> 52:16.140
- What was that word?
- Sensitive.

52:16.212 --> 52:17.110
Now, listen, mister.

52:17.180 --> 52:19.614
l ain't got no time
for you to be talking Greek.

52:19.682 --> 52:20.979
How'd you bag that babe?

52:21.050 --> 52:26.317
Aw, fella, somebody's
got to teach you a thing or two about...

52:26.389 --> 52:28.118
Sensitivity

52:28.191 --> 52:29.385
Sensitivity

52:29.459 --> 52:32.223
Show that girl
you really give a ''D''

52:32.295 --> 52:35.287
Show her
your mind is occupied

52:35.365 --> 52:38.300
With more than
the pictures in the TV Gui <i>d</i> e

52:38.368 --> 52:41.735
Show her you've got
a bit of bona fide

52:41.805 --> 52:43.466
Sensitivity

52:43.540 --> 52:44.700
Sensitivity

52:44.774 --> 52:46.207
Sensitivity

52:46.276 --> 52:47.538
Sensitivity

52:47.610 --> 52:50.272
Makes for
a groovy conductivity

52:50.346 --> 52:51.779
The base word ''sensitive''

52:51.848 --> 52:52.974
Sensitive

52:53.049 --> 52:54.983
Now, that's
an adjective

52:55.051 --> 52:56.450
Adjective

52:56.519 --> 52:59.113
''l-t-y'' is a suffix
they found

52:59.189 --> 53:02.283
To tack on the end
and make it a noun

53:02.358 --> 53:05.486
And that turns sensitive
to sensitivity!

53:05.562 --> 53:07.325
Sensitivity

53:07.397 --> 53:08.659
Sensitivity

53:08.731 --> 53:10.323

Sensitivity

Sensitivity

53:14.571 --> 53:15.970
Sensitivity

53:17.574 --> 53:19.974
Hey, hold on there,
music boy.

53:20.043 --> 53:22.477
What does grammar
have to do with getting chicks?

53:22.545 --> 53:25.309
Nothing if you're Sly Stallone,
but look here, Johnny

53:25.381 --> 53:26.905
Whoa!
How'd you know my name?

53:26.983 --> 53:30.510
That doesn't matter.
All that matters is that...

53:30.587 --> 53:32.350
Everybody's got a name

53:32.422 --> 53:33.514
Hey, what's
your name?

53:33.590 --> 53:35.524
Your special little
claim to fame

53:35.592 --> 53:37.253
Hey, what's
your name?

53:37.327 --> 53:38.851
l got a pal
whose name is Jim

53:38.928 --> 53:42.261
And when l want to talk to him,
l say, ''Hey, Jim!''

53:42.332 --> 53:44.197
That's how he knows
l'm talking to him

53:44.267 --> 53:45.234
Look, mister,

53:45.301 --> 53:46.893
This is getting
really old really fast.

53:46.970 --> 53:48.062
Ok, Johnny.
Come on.

53:48.137 --> 53:50.469
We're going to teach you about
sensitivity.

53:59.115 --> 54:00.548
You like her,
Johnny?

54:00.617 --> 54:02.050
Oh, baby.

54:02.118 --> 54:03.949
She is so fine.

54:04.020 --> 54:05.885
Next lesson,
Johnny observation.

54:06.723 --> 54:08.748
Look,
she's got a pooch.

54:08.825 --> 54:10.122
That gives you
something to talk about.

54:10.193 --> 54:11.888
Keep your eyes
open, Johnny.

54:11.961 --> 54:14.555
Observation is a noun

54:14.631 --> 54:18.567
That means you know exactly
what is going down

54:18.635 --> 54:22.071
Observation is a way

54:22.138 --> 54:25.801
For Johnny and the girl
to start a repartee

54:25.875 --> 54:27.069
Howdy, there,
my beauty

54:27.143 --> 54:28.576
Hello, sir,
how do you do?

54:28.645 --> 54:30.579
Oh, isn't he
a cutie?

54:30.647 --> 54:32.137
But not
as cute as you

54:32.215 --> 54:35.981
See? Observation, Johnny,
it just clears the fog

54:36.052 --> 54:39.579
All l had to do
was notice she had a dog

54:39.656 --> 54:42.591
Observation--
it'll get you far

54:42.659 --> 54:46.595
lt'll get that girl out of your dreams
and into your car

54:46.663 --> 54:48.290
Try it, Johnny

54:51.668 --> 54:54.000
Ok, but stand back.

54:54.070 --> 54:55.401
Hey, there,
foxy lady.

54:55.471 --> 54:57.063
Oh, hello.

54:57.140 --> 54:59.665
That's a fine-looking
weenie dog you got there.

54:59.742 --> 55:01.004
Hmm. Thank you.

55:01.077 --> 55:04.843
Say, how about you and me sharing
a soda right now?

55:04.914 --> 55:07.178
Oh! My Fluffy!

55:08.451 --> 55:09.645
Oh, mama!

55:09.719 --> 55:11.584
Runaway weenie dog!

55:20.263 --> 55:23.357
Hubba, hubba, hubba.
l'm coming, Fido.

55:30.206 --> 55:31.195
Got you.

55:31.274 --> 55:34.266
Hmm. She might still
go out with me.

55:34.344 --> 55:36.608
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

55:36.679 --> 55:38.613
ls there any way
l can repay you?

55:38.681 --> 55:41.582
Well, you could grant me the pleasure
of taking you out to dinner.

55:41.651 --> 55:44.677
Oh! The pleasure's
all mine.

55:46.522 --> 55:48.387
Can l come?

55:49.726 --> 55:51.421
[ grr ]

55:51.728 --> 55:54.288
Or you could just
bring me back some pie.

56:01.037 --> 56:03.471
Hey, get a look
at that chick at the counter.

56:03.539 --> 56:06.667
l bet if l went over there
and flexed my pecs--

56:06.743 --> 56:08.870
She'd pour
that phosphate down your pants.

56:08.945 --> 56:10.674
Fella, you're too masculine.
You know that?

56:10.747 --> 56:12.977
Why, ain't that like
being too ethical?

56:13.583 --> 56:17.815
Johnny, a woman likes a man who's in
touch with his feminine side.

56:17.887 --> 56:19.582
You got to think
like one of them.

56:19.656 --> 56:20.987
Meaning...

56:21.424 --> 56:23.187
Matching your
shirts and pants

56:23.259 --> 56:25.489
Purely by
winds of chance

56:25.561 --> 56:29.156
Won't leave her
impressed

56:29.232 --> 56:31.063
Poetry by the lake

56:31.134 --> 56:32.999
Baking the girl a cake

56:33.069 --> 56:36.664
Does much more
than beating your chest

56:36.739 --> 56:40.675
Your feminine side, boy,
your feminine side

56:40.743 --> 56:43.974
Whenever you can,
favor Jekyll over Hyde

56:44.047 --> 56:46.709
Let's see
a shellful of female

56:46.783 --> 56:48.216
Cracked open and fried

56:48.284 --> 56:52.118
So you can find
your feminine side

56:52.989 --> 56:54.752
Trust me, Johnny.

56:54.824 --> 56:56.758
Ok.

56:56.826 --> 56:59.989
Hyah.
Excuse me, Miss.

57:00.063 --> 57:00.995
[ gasps ]

57:01.064 --> 57:04.500
How'd you like to paint the town red
with a happening hipster?

57:05.268 --> 57:07.202

57:12.675 --> 57:14.472
Oh, where did l
go wrong?

57:14.544 --> 57:15.875
MAN:
Say, you're kind of pretty,

57:15.945 --> 57:17.845
and we're
on shore leave.

57:20.650 --> 57:22.015
Excuse me just a second.

till next shore leave.

Oh, baby.

57:38.201 --> 57:41.398
l'm going to make
her dreams come true.

57:41.471 --> 57:42.961
H'yah!

57:45.074 --> 57:46.541
And what's your angle?

57:46.609 --> 57:48.839
l'm going to say,
''hey, hot mama,

57:48.911 --> 57:51.311
want to go back to my place for
a game of Twister?''

57:51.380 --> 57:52.938
No, no.
Next lesson, Johnny.

57:53.015 --> 57:56.416
Calling a woman ''hot mama'' isn't
the way to win her over.

57:56.486 --> 57:58.420
You've got to show her
some respect.

57:58.488 --> 57:59.750
How do l do that?

58:00.389 --> 58:02.084
M-a-n-n-e-r-s

58:02.158 --> 58:03.955
That's the way
to sure success

58:04.026 --> 58:05.789
You don't need
that hairy chest

58:05.862 --> 58:07.921
You need manners

58:07.997 --> 58:09.965
R-e-s-p-e-c-t

58:10.032 --> 58:11.863
She's a lock,
and that's the key

58:11.934 --> 58:13.697
''Thank you,'' ''please,''
and ''pardon me''

58:13.770 --> 58:15.431
That's manners

58:15.972 --> 58:17.496
She's your little
sugar dear

58:17.573 --> 58:19.973
So treat her
with respect

58:20.042 --> 58:23.569
Call 800-ATT
instead of just collect

58:24.113 --> 58:25.978
lf you try
to flip her wig

58:26.048 --> 58:28.016
Simply just
by talking big

58:28.084 --> 58:31.144
She'll say you're a sexist pig
with no manners

58:33.456 --> 58:36.357
See, Johnny? Now, try it,
and remember, manners.

58:36.425 --> 58:38.916
Use words like ''pardon me,''
''if you please,''

58:38.995 --> 58:40.860
and ''may l
have the pleasure?''

58:40.930 --> 58:43.330
Pardon me,
hot sexy mama,

58:43.399 --> 58:47.233

at my studly bod,

58:47.303 --> 58:48.395

have the pleasure

of you wanting to be
my number-one main squeeze.

Oh! Ooh!

59:09.892 --> 59:12.952
Oh, Johnny,
you did it again.

59:13.029 --> 59:16.328
Um, do you want
to hand me my teeth?

59:16.399 --> 59:19.300
They're over there
by that shoe store.

59:23.339 --> 59:25.102
lt ain't for me,
mister.

59:25.174 --> 59:28.041
Maybe you can stand to be sweet and
sensitive all the time,

59:28.110 --> 59:30.078
but that's not my style.

59:30.146 --> 59:31.272
Well, you know, Johnny,

59:31.347 --> 59:34.544
you've got to act polite, thoughtful,
and considerate,

59:34.617 --> 59:36.676
but no one ever said
you got to mean it.

59:36.752 --> 59:39.277
Heck, l'd tell a girl l could turn lead
into gold

59:39.355 --> 59:41.084
if it would get her
to date me.

59:41.157 --> 59:45.787
l'd just be sure to say it in a sincere,
sensitive way.

59:45.862 --> 59:47.955
Tell her what you know
she'll really...

59:48.030 --> 59:49.497
Want to hear

59:49.565 --> 59:51.294
Just be sure
you tell her in a...

59:51.367 --> 59:52.959
Way sincere

59:53.035 --> 59:56.163
Say it with the candor
of a mousketeer

59:56.239 --> 59:57.831
Keep your eyes
on her face

59:57.907 --> 59:59.898
That's the proper
hemisphere

59:59.976 --> 01:00:00.806
Come again?

01:00:00.877 --> 01:00:03.573
The easiest way to a woman's heart
is sincerity.

01:00:03.646 --> 01:00:06.706
lf you can fake that,
you've got it made.

01:00:08.584 --> 01:00:10.313
You've got it made

01:00:10.386 --> 01:00:12.013
You've got it made

01:00:12.088 --> 01:00:15.524
The women will flock
like an Easter parade

01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:19.118
So much for
flowers and serenades

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:22.858
Learn how to fake it,
learn how to fake it, Johnny

01:00:22.932 --> 01:00:28.336
And you've got it made

01:00:28.404 --> 01:00:30.702
Boy, you've got it made.

JOHNNY:
Hold up there, fella.

01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:35.040
What's the matter,
Johnny?

01:00:35.111 --> 01:00:37.341
Oh, hello, ladies.

01:00:37.413 --> 01:00:39.210
l can explain.
Really, l...

01:00:39.282 --> 01:00:42.183
Hey, girls,
what say we go make a wish?

01:00:42.251 --> 01:00:44.549

a fine idea.

quite like that.

Two gifts for Johnny?
Will wonders not cease?

So, Jane,

Well, Ven <i>d</i> ela,

02:27:58.823 --> 02:28:01.314
the problem with men
like Johnny

02:28:01.392 --> 02:28:04.850
is they are completely
narcissistic!

02:28:04.929 --> 02:28:06.988
Hey, wait a minute.
Did she call me a sissy?

02:28:07.065 --> 02:28:11.695
Men like Johnny are afraid
of strong women!

02:28:11.769 --> 02:28:12.758
Hey, hey, hey,

02:28:12.837 --> 02:28:15.499

Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:31.684
Does this scare you?

Hey, lady or no lady,

02:28:39.063 --> 02:28:40.428
Thanks, babycakes.

02:28:40.498 --> 02:28:45.367
No, thank 10 years of rodeo training in
Salinas, California.

02:28:45.436 --> 02:28:48.200
And don't call me

02:29:11.763 --> 02:29:13.390
Hyah!

you'd like to see my superpowers.

02:29:19.837 --> 02:29:20.997

Huh! Ha!

02:29:36.220 --> 02:29:37.209
Ha!

02:29:37.722 --> 02:29:39.087
[bells tinkle]

02:29:41.192 --> 02:29:43.660
They don't call us
supermodels for nothing.

02:29:43.728 --> 02:29:45.218
You got to love it.

02:29:45.296 --> 02:29:49.255
DlRECTOR:
And 3, 2, 1 ...We're back.

02:29:49.333 --> 02:29:51.528
We're here with

He's healthy.

02:29:54.639 --> 02:29:56.402
Ooh...

02:29:56.474 --> 02:29:58.101
He's agile.

02:29:58.176 --> 02:30:01.009
You got that right.
Check this out.

02:30:01.079 --> 02:30:03.741
Huh! Hyah! Hyah!

02:30:05.450 --> 02:30:07.281
Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

AUDlENCE:
Ahh...

02:30:09.387 --> 02:30:11.514
But is he
a dinosaur?

02:30:11.589 --> 02:30:12.556
AUDlENCE:
Huh?

02:30:12.623 --> 02:30:14.591
No, actually
l'm a dinosaur.

02:30:14.659 --> 02:30:17.253
Ah. But let's compare
the two, shall we?

02:30:17.328 --> 02:30:19.888
They're both pretty much
pure muscle.

02:30:19.964 --> 02:30:22.194
All that and a bag
of chips, baby.

02:30:24.435 --> 02:30:26.733
They both have brains
the size of an electron.

02:30:26.804 --> 02:30:28.362
Electron?

02:30:28.439 --> 02:30:30.373
That's how America
picks her presidents.

02:30:30.441 --> 02:30:32.204
Oh.

02:30:32.276 --> 02:30:34.437
And they're both
extinct.

02:30:34.512 --> 02:30:36.571
Stop calling T-Rex
extinct!

02:30:36.647 --> 02:30:39.616
You know how impossible it is for
T-Rex to get a driver's license

02:30:39.684 --> 02:30:41.879
when people think
T-Rexes don't exist?

02:30:41.953 --> 02:30:43.545
Now, hold on there,
fruit cup.

02:30:43.621 --> 02:30:46.249
How can you be so cruel
to stupid animals?

02:30:46.324 --> 02:30:48.554
Hey, who you
calling stupid?

02:30:48.626 --> 02:30:50.958
At least T-Rex knows
what an electron is.

02:30:51.028 --> 02:30:52.222
MAN lN AUDlENCE:
Hey!

02:30:53.564 --> 02:30:55.464
What's on your mind,
sir?

02:30:55.533 --> 02:30:57.194
Johnny shouldn't
be allowed to talk

02:30:57.268 --> 02:31:00.465
to the dinosaur
like that.

02:31:00.538 --> 02:31:03.996
How could you allow him
to call you a fruit cup?

02:31:05.009 --> 02:31:07.443
We shouldn't let him
get away with that.

02:31:07.512 --> 02:31:10.174
Get Johnny Bravo!

02:31:10.248 --> 02:31:11.715
[audience shouting]

02:31:11.783 --> 02:31:13.944
Now we're going to see
who's extinct.

02:31:14.018 --> 02:31:17.681
See you in a museum,
you fossil.

02:31:19.857 --> 02:31:21.484
Huh! Hyah!

02:31:21.559 --> 02:31:24.653
Huh! Tomorrow

02:31:24.729 --> 02:31:25.661
Huh! Ha!

02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:27.493
TV violence. Ho!

02:31:27.565 --> 02:31:29.328
Where do they get off?

02:31:30.334 --> 02:31:31.596
Ha!

02:31:32.603 --> 02:31:34.298
Ooh! Oh, mama.

02:31:34.372 --> 02:31:36.033
That's a good question.

02:31:36.107 --> 02:31:38.405
DlRECTOR:
And cut!

02:31:38.476 --> 02:31:39.966

02:31:52.690 --> 02:31:56.023
l'd like to give a
special hello to Johnny Bravo,

02:31:56.294 --> 02:31:58.421
who is recuperating
at the hospital.

AUDlENCE:
Aw...

02:31:59.864 --> 02:32:00.831
She wants me.

02:32:00.898 --> 02:32:02.559
And as soon as
you're healed,

02:32:02.633 --> 02:32:04.794
we would love to have you back.

02:32:04.869 --> 02:32:08.236
How about you heal me
with your love, pretty mama?

02:32:13.578 --> 02:32:16.274
And we'll be right back
with today's topic:

02:32:16.347 --> 02:32:17.814
Does love hurt?

02:32:21.986 --> 02:32:23.749
Oh, mama!

Mr. Vulture,
how many licks does it take

02:32:30.428 --> 02:32:33.522
to get to the sugary center
of a sugar sucker?

02:32:33.598 --> 02:32:37.090
Good question.
Go ask Johnny Bravo.

02:32:38.336 --> 02:32:40.201
Mr. Bravo,

02:32:44.609 --> 02:32:45.701
Thanks, kid.

02:33:09.634 --> 02:33:10.566

Yo, l can't be with

if y'all had any extra tickets
to tonight's show.

02:35:22.299 --> 02:35:26.793
Man, you find us a turntable,

02:35:32.043 --> 02:35:34.238
Can you teach me
how to be...Down?

02:35:34.311 --> 02:35:35.744
Whatever that means.

02:35:35.813 --> 02:35:37.644

02:45:10.735 --> 02:45:14.671
Hey...That shark
just ate those guys.

02:45:14.739 --> 02:45:17.765
Hey, everybody,
do the shark attack.

02:45:17.842 --> 02:45:20.276
[cheering]

02:45:20.345 --> 02:45:23.781
l got to warn you.
l'm the big kahuna around here.

02:45:23.848 --> 02:45:25.372
The big ka-what-a?

02:45:25.450 --> 02:45:28.248
Never mind.
Just catch that wave.

02:45:38.129 --> 02:45:43.066
Oh, man, this is
not good for my hair!

02:45:54.512 --> 02:45:56.275
[coughing]

02:46:01.653 --> 02:46:02.950
Oh, yeah.

02:46:03.021 --> 02:46:05.581
One little spray
will hold you all day.

02:46:05.657 --> 02:46:07.454
Ohh!

02:46:07.525 --> 02:46:10.585
Whoa!

02:46:18.369 --> 02:46:21.099
l now crown you
king of the beach.

02:46:21.172 --> 02:46:23.265
My hero!

02:46:24.342 --> 02:46:26.902
You know, l may have
this thing on my head,

02:46:26.978 --> 02:46:28.570
but at least
l got the girl.

02:46:28.646 --> 02:46:30.546
Ow. My eye.

02:46:30.615 --> 02:46:33.550
Listen, Franny,
you're a swell kid.

02:46:33.618 --> 02:46:35.779
You don't need any
of this phony jazz.

02:46:36.888 --> 02:46:40.915
Maybe you'd understand it
a little better if l sang it to you.

02:46:40.992 --> 02:46:43.927
When a guy digs
a way-out chick

02:46:43.995 --> 02:46:47.123
But she's been
putting him down

02:46:47.198 --> 02:46:49.928
Only one thing
will set him straight

02:46:50.001 --> 02:46:52.435
And keep him
hanging around

02:46:52.504 --> 02:46:55.439
That thing is
love, love, love

02:46:55.507 --> 02:46:58.442
That thing is love

02:46:59.377 --> 02:47:01.743
Oh, Andy,
you're so hootie.

02:47:01.813 --> 02:47:03.474
l just love it
when you sing.

02:47:03.548 --> 02:47:05.175
Let's kiss
and make up.

02:47:06.351 --> 02:47:09.286
When a chick
digs a way-out guy

02:47:09.354 --> 02:47:12.118
And he digs
that way-out chick

02:47:12.190 --> 02:47:15.125
lf they want
to be together forever

02:47:15.193 --> 02:47:17.957
Only one thing
will do the trick

02:47:18.029 --> 02:47:20.554
That thing
is love, love, love

02:47:20.632 --> 02:47:23.465
That thing is love

02:47:23.802 --> 02:47:25.269
JOHNNY:
Ah, man.

02:47:25.336 --> 02:47:28.169
This is the last time
l come to the beach.

02:47:28.239 --> 02:47:30.901
Hi there.
My name's Martha Washington.

02:47:30.975 --> 02:47:33.466
Want to go
for a swim?

02:47:54.432 --> 02:47:56.263
[people whispering]

02:47:58.069 --> 02:48:00.469
Order! Order in the court!

02:48:00.538 --> 02:48:03.200
Mr. Bravo, your apparent lack
of good judgment

02:48:03.274 --> 02:48:06.004
yesterday is by all accounts
inexcusable!

02:48:06.077 --> 02:48:09.274
What on Earth possessed you
to do the things you did?

02:48:09.347 --> 02:48:12.214
Well, your honor,
it all started yesterday morning.

02:48:12.283 --> 02:48:14.444
We had a power outage.

02:48:14.519 --> 02:48:16.384
Don't know
exactly how it happened.

02:48:16.754 --> 02:48:19.814
Well, Mark, looks like
the new scissor-tipped fighter jet

02:48:19.891 --> 02:48:21.756
is going to be A-Ok.

02:48:23.962 --> 02:48:25.896
[rooster crows]

02:48:28.499 --> 02:48:32.026
Anyway, when l noticed the VCR
blinking 12:00 over and over,

02:48:32.103 --> 02:48:34.594
l thought what any warm-blooded
American would have thought,

02:48:34.672 --> 02:48:36.037
given the same situation.

02:48:36.107 --> 02:48:38.667
Looks like time's frozen
for everybody but me.

02:48:38.743 --> 02:48:40.074
Hyah!

02:48:40.144 --> 02:48:41.839
JOHNNY, VOlCE-OVER:
The faucets weren't running,

02:48:41.913 --> 02:48:43.107
which made sense because
the water

02:48:43.181 --> 02:48:45.843
was probably stopped
in time inside the pipes.

02:48:52.156 --> 02:48:53.589
[dog barking]

02:48:53.658 --> 02:48:56.092
Well, shoot, here's
your problem, Mrs. Bravo--

02:48:56.160 --> 02:48:57.593
German shepherd
in the plumbing.

02:48:57.662 --> 02:49:01.029
Well, that's a relief.
Last time it was a man.

02:49:04.002 --> 02:49:06.596
Hmm...l bet if l held
perfectly still,

02:49:06.671 --> 02:49:09.162
l could balance
this egg on my nose.

02:49:11.676 --> 02:49:13.610
JOHNNY, VOlCE-OVER:
Yeah.
lt was the people, too.

02:49:13.678 --> 02:49:15.703
Everybody was
dead-frozen in time.

02:49:15.780 --> 02:49:17.680
[horns honking]

02:49:21.352 --> 02:49:23.946
Boy, all this honking isn't doing
anybody any good.

02:49:24.022 --> 02:49:26.115
Yeah. lt's definitely
not moving the traffic.

02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:27.248
We should all
just shut up.

02:49:27.325 --> 02:49:28.724
Maybe even get
some sleep.

02:49:28.793 --> 02:49:30.192
Now you're talking.

02:49:30.261 --> 02:49:33.094
[people snoring]

02:49:35.934 --> 02:49:37.697
Oh, mama!

02:49:37.769 --> 02:49:40.533
l felt like l was in
the twilight zone or something,

02:49:40.605 --> 02:49:42.937
and l figured
l'd better check this out.

02:49:47.145 --> 02:49:49.579
Oh, man, this stuff's
like quicksand.

02:49:49.647 --> 02:49:52.775
The more you try to get out,
the deeper you sink in.

02:49:52.850 --> 02:49:54.784
l'd best just hold still.

02:49:54.852 --> 02:49:56.114
JOHNNY, VOlCE-OVER:
lt was actually kind of fun

02:49:56.187 --> 02:50:00.283
to see what everybody was doing
at the moment time froze.

02:50:00.358 --> 02:50:01.518
And then l started to think

02:50:01.592 --> 02:50:05.153
about the possibilities
of my situation.

02:50:05.229 --> 02:50:07.254
No time meant no rules.

02:50:07.332 --> 02:50:09.266
Nobody was going to bust me

02:50:09.334 --> 02:50:11.302
for doing anything
l wasn't supposed to do.

02:50:11.369 --> 02:50:14.463
Oh, yeah!
This could be entirely groovy.

02:50:17.542 --> 02:50:20.204
Steady, Billy,
steady.

02:50:20.278 --> 02:50:22.075
Aw, Billy,
look what you did.

02:50:22.146 --> 02:50:24.137
Oh, sorry, dad.

02:50:24.215 --> 02:50:27.150
Look, run downstairs
and get the blow-dryer.

02:50:27.218 --> 02:50:29.914
Otherwise l'm going
to have to stand here all day with this.

02:50:31.122 --> 02:50:34.614
Ah, mama! Free candy!

02:50:34.692 --> 02:50:36.922
Ooh! Peanut butter,
bananas. Ooh!

02:50:38.563 --> 02:50:41.088
Oh, mama!

02:50:41.165 --> 02:50:43.292
[loud stomping]

02:50:46.304 --> 02:50:48.238
[groaning]

02:50:48.306 --> 02:50:49.830
Oh!

02:50:51.576 --> 02:50:53.737
[stomping]

02:50:53.811 --> 02:50:56.939
Ron, look!
lt's a manatee.

02:50:57.015 --> 02:50:58.915
RON:
You mean
the sea cow?

02:50:58.983 --> 02:51:01.110
WOMAN:
Yes! They're
so frightening.

02:51:01.185 --> 02:51:06.179
Now, don't move a muscle.
Their eyesight isn't as good as ours.

02:51:10.762 --> 02:51:14.061
Oh, Ron,
l was so scared!

02:51:14.132 --> 02:51:17.932
There, there.
He's gone, honey, far away.

02:51:19.270 --> 02:51:20.703
JOHNNY, VOlCE-OVER:
All that candy

02:51:20.772 --> 02:51:22.637
was giving me an appetite
for some real food,

02:51:22.707 --> 02:51:24.766
so l figured this was
my one good chance

02:51:24.842 --> 02:51:26.833
to dine at the ritziest in town.

02:51:26.944 --> 02:51:29.640
Yeah. l'd be eating
fancy tonight.

02:51:29.714 --> 02:51:32.205
Hey, guys, what say
we play charades

02:51:32.283 --> 02:51:34.308
while we let
the duck meat thaw?

02:51:34.385 --> 02:51:36.615
All right. Pick one.

02:51:38.456 --> 02:51:39.821
Hmm...A rock?

02:51:39.891 --> 02:51:42.223
Ok, here goes.

02:51:42.293 --> 02:51:44.727
Hmm...Looks
difficult.

02:51:44.796 --> 02:51:46.457
We're going to
need a moment of silence

02:51:46.531 --> 02:51:48.726
to figure
this one out.

02:51:48.800 --> 02:51:50.893
JOHNNY, VOlCE-OVER:
Well, there was plenty
to choose from.

02:51:50.968 --> 02:51:53.903
Man, did they have
some fine-looking desserts!

02:51:53.971 --> 02:51:55.233
Yummy!

02:51:55.306 --> 02:51:57.399
l decided to load up.

02:52:02.313 --> 02:52:05.009
[people gasp]

02:52:05.083 --> 02:52:06.414
Power outage.

02:52:06.484 --> 02:52:07.849
Think it'll
happen again?

02:52:07.919 --> 02:52:09.352
Let's wait and see.

02:52:17.061 --> 02:52:18.926
[burp]
Check, please.

02:52:18.996 --> 02:52:22.022
What? No charge?
Why, thank you very much.

02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:23.590
Ha ha!

02:52:24.769 --> 02:52:26.031
Guess it was a fluke.

02:52:26.104 --> 02:52:28.265
Well, let's not let it
spoil our dinner.

02:52:29.607 --> 02:52:31.541
Well, l was about ready
for some shuteye

02:52:31.609 --> 02:52:33.702
after such a big
whopping meal,

02:52:33.778 --> 02:52:37.111
and, hey, why knock off
my new high-class lifestyle now?

02:52:37.181 --> 02:52:40.878
l was going to spend the night
at the Waldorf Hysteria. Hyah!

02:52:45.456 --> 02:52:47.788
Ok, everybody,
this is a holdup!

02:52:47.859 --> 02:52:48.826
[all gasp]

02:52:48.893 --> 02:52:50.861
Now, l'm going to go
empty the safe.

02:52:50.928 --> 02:52:53.829
lf anybody moves a muscle
before l get back,

02:52:53.898 --> 02:52:55.889
y'all are
going to get it.

02:52:55.967 --> 02:52:57.764
JOHNNY, VOlCE-OVER:
Well, with time frozen still,

02:52:57.835 --> 02:52:59.632
it wasn't hard for me
to get a room key.

02:52:59.704 --> 02:53:02.138
Hey, what do you think, mister?
This a nice room?

02:53:02.206 --> 02:53:04.106
Hey, lf you're a loser,
don't say nothing.

02:53:04.175 --> 02:53:05.642
l thought so.

02:53:07.879 --> 02:53:09.471
Aw, mama!

02:53:09.547 --> 02:53:11.412
Now, this is the life!

02:53:11.482 --> 02:53:12.813
Hyah!

02:53:15.353 --> 02:53:18.413
Aw, figures.
TV's frozen, too.

02:53:18.489 --> 02:53:20.923
[snoring]

02:53:20.992 --> 02:53:22.619
Ah...more peanut butter.

02:53:22.693 --> 02:53:24.126
MAN:
Well, we're back.

02:53:24.195 --> 02:53:28.097
Let's see how the Duke boys are
going to get out of this one.

02:53:28.166 --> 02:53:30.760
[rooster crows]

02:53:34.805 --> 02:53:37.171
All right, fella,
you're coming with us!

02:53:37.241 --> 02:53:38.731
Oh, mama!

02:53:38.809 --> 02:53:41.004
Time is back
with a vengeance.

02:53:42.513 --> 02:53:44.378
And that's the whole
story, your majesty.

02:53:44.448 --> 02:53:45.380
Your honor.

02:53:45.449 --> 02:53:47.280
Oh, you don't have
to call me that.

02:53:47.351 --> 02:53:49.285
You see,
l thought time had already stopped.

02:53:49.353 --> 02:53:50.752
l guess
l screwed up, huh?

02:53:50.821 --> 02:53:53.915
Ha ha ha!
What a delightful little tale.

02:53:53.991 --> 02:53:56.459
Mr. Bravo, l sympathize
wholeheartedly.

02:53:56.527 --> 02:53:59.928
And to think this was all
started by a blinking VCR.

02:53:59.997 --> 02:54:01.521
My word, if l had a nickel

02:54:01.599 --> 02:54:03.260
for all the trouble
l've had with those things--

02:54:03.334 --> 02:54:06.770
why, one time, l thought l was
stuck in July 23 for 6 weeks!

02:54:06.837 --> 02:54:08.737
Ha ha ha!
Case dismissed!

02:54:08.806 --> 02:54:10.205
[people cheer]

02:54:10.274 --> 02:54:13.607
Oh, Johnny,
l knew you were innocent.

02:54:13.678 --> 02:54:15.111
Me, too, Johnny.

02:54:15.179 --> 02:54:17.875
How about we all go out
for a fudge sundae?

02:54:17.949 --> 02:54:19.246
Why not?

02:54:19.317 --> 02:54:22.115
We've got all the time
in the world. Hyah!

02:54:30.294 --> 02:54:32.057
Hi.
l'm Johnny Bravo, and--

02:54:32.129 --> 02:54:33.153
Hey!

02:54:33.231 --> 02:54:35.062
What the--

02:54:35.132 --> 02:54:36.565
now hold on a--

02:54:36.634 --> 02:54:37.794
Blll!

02:54:37.868 --> 02:54:38.857
Blah!

02:54:38.936 --> 02:54:40.767
Hee-haw!

02:54:40.838 --> 02:54:42.635
Mama!

02:54:45.209 --> 02:54:46.699
Sorry about that, folks.

02:54:48.212 --> 02:54:49.873
Hey, look, l'm counting!

02:55:06.130 --> 02:55:08.155
TV:
Look, l don't want
to alarm the passengers,

02:55:08.232 --> 02:55:09.722
but there's a bomb on this bus,

02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:11.995
and if you go over
55 miles an hour, we're all dead.

02:55:12.069 --> 02:55:13.502
Actually,
that's all right.

02:55:13.571 --> 02:55:15.004
55 is
the speed limit.

02:55:15.072 --> 02:55:17.165
Oh, well, l guess
we're ok then.

02:55:17.241 --> 02:55:19.334
[explosion,
screaming, and sirens]

02:55:19.410 --> 02:55:21.674
Man, l dig
these action flicks.

02:55:21.746 --> 02:55:23.441
[doorbell rings]

02:55:24.048 --> 02:55:26.243
Hyah!
That must be my pizza.

02:55:27.885 --> 02:55:29.375
Hey, where's
the mushrooms?

02:55:29.453 --> 02:55:31.717
Hello, sir.
Would you care to donate a toy

02:55:31.789 --> 02:55:34.349
to the kids
with empty rooms foundation?

02:55:34.425 --> 02:55:35.357
Ha ha ha!

02:55:35.426 --> 02:55:37.155
No, seriously,
where's the mushrooms?

02:55:37.228 --> 02:55:38.160
Huh?

02:55:38.229 --> 02:55:39.423
Never mind.

02:55:42.867 --> 02:55:43.697
[doorbell rings]

02:55:43.768 --> 02:55:46.293
Buttercups!
l'm going to have to go get the spray.

02:55:47.471 --> 02:55:49.996
Look, l thought
l said--

02:55:50.074 --> 02:55:51.974
W-w-w-wah...

02:55:55.079 --> 02:55:57.377
You weren't very nice
to my sister.

02:55:57.448 --> 02:55:59.075
That little girl
is your sister?

02:55:59.150 --> 02:56:01.175
All we want
is a toy donation.

02:56:01.252 --> 02:56:04.119
Ah, boy, l don't
know if l got any toys.

02:56:04.188 --> 02:56:06.383
Oh, well, sorry
to bother you then.

02:56:06.457 --> 02:56:08.015
Let's go, Caroline.

02:56:08.092 --> 02:56:10.026
No. Wait.
lf you give me 20 minutes,

02:56:10.094 --> 02:56:12.688
l'll run down to Eternitoys and get you
something really happenin'.

02:56:12.763 --> 02:56:14.196
10 minutes.

02:56:14.265 --> 02:56:16.199
We've got the rest
of the block to cover.

02:56:16.267 --> 02:56:18.531
Right. 10 minutes.
Don't go nowhere.

02:56:18.602 --> 02:56:20.035
Hyuh!

02:56:20.104 --> 02:56:21.264
l'll be
right here.

02:56:24.875 --> 02:56:27.036
Ooh!

02:56:27.111 --> 02:56:29.011
Can l help you, sir?

02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:31.173
Yeah. l need to find
some toys fast.

02:56:31.248 --> 02:56:33.011
How much you
looking to spend?

02:56:33.084 --> 02:56:34.984
Um...

02:56:35.052 --> 02:56:36.451
What guy is that again?

02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:38.078
George Washington.

02:56:38.155 --> 02:56:40.589
George Washington...
Yeah, l got one George Washington.

02:56:40.658 --> 02:56:42.250
Hmm. A dollar.

02:56:42.326 --> 02:56:44.260
Well, there's our
discount section, aisle 6

02:56:44.328 --> 02:56:45.920
for defective
or otherwise damaged toys.

02:56:45.996 --> 02:56:47.327
You might be able
to find something there.

02:56:47.398 --> 02:56:48.831
Thanks, Chachi.

02:56:52.903 --> 02:56:54.996
Aw, mama.
Decisions, decisions--

02:56:55.072 --> 02:56:57.302
and l got
to make one fast.

02:56:57.375 --> 02:56:59.240
Let's see now.
What's this thing?

02:56:59.310 --> 02:57:00.834
Hi. l'm a Keith doll.

02:57:00.911 --> 02:57:02.742
Holy guacamole.
You talked!

02:57:02.813 --> 02:57:04.110
Sure did. Guess what.

02:57:04.181 --> 02:57:06.115
l'm defective,
but that's ok.

02:57:06.183 --> 02:57:08.378
l'm still happy
with who l am.

02:57:08.452 --> 02:57:09.885
Well, what's wrong
with you?

02:57:09.954 --> 02:57:11.353
l'm wearing white pants.

02:57:11.422 --> 02:57:13.151
- So?
- lt's after Labor Day.

02:57:13.224 --> 02:57:15.124
That's a fashion no-no.

02:57:15.192 --> 02:57:17.387
Needless to say,
Barbie won't go out with me.

02:57:17.461 --> 02:57:18.860
What a snot, huh?

02:57:18.929 --> 02:57:20.021
What a snot!

02:57:20.097 --> 02:57:21.359
Ok, what else
we got here?

02:57:21.432 --> 02:57:23.457
That's general
issue Jeremy.

02:57:23.534 --> 02:57:25.559
He's got one arm
and one leg.

02:57:25.636 --> 02:57:27.069
Left. Left. Left. Left.

02:57:27.138 --> 02:57:29.629
l also got kung-fu grip.
Hyah!

02:57:29.707 --> 02:57:30.696
Ohh...

02:57:31.709 --> 02:57:33.540
Hey, watch it,
Beetle Bailey.

02:57:33.611 --> 02:57:34.669
You there,
pick me!

02:57:34.745 --> 02:57:35.871
What?

02:57:35.946 --> 02:57:38.813
There's tons of fun to be had
with the Cubix Bomb.

02:57:38.883 --> 02:57:41.977
Cubix Bomb?
What's that all about?

02:57:42.052 --> 02:57:44.646
Quite simple,
you blunt-edged plebeian.

02:57:44.722 --> 02:57:48.055
Get all the colors right
and l explode, or perhaps l don't.

02:57:48.125 --> 02:57:50.559
Perhaps l release
a corrosive venom,

02:57:50.628 --> 02:57:51.458
but maybe not.

02:57:51.529 --> 02:57:54.225
Maybe l issue forth
a flesh-eating virus.

02:57:54.298 --> 02:57:55.390
ls that what's
wrong with you?

02:57:55.466 --> 02:57:56.831
No...

02:57:56.901 --> 02:57:58.334
the yellow's
on the wrong side.

02:57:58.402 --> 02:58:00.336
Oh. Well,
ok, now, l only got a buck here,

02:58:00.404 --> 02:58:01.496
so who is it
going to be?

02:58:01.572 --> 02:58:03.472
Lucky day.
There just happens to be a

02:58:03.541 --> 02:58:06.271
3-for-a-dollar special
on all discount toys.

02:58:06.343 --> 02:58:07.742
Ah, so much
the better.

02:58:07.812 --> 02:58:09.575
Ok. Hop in,
everyone.

02:58:11.182 --> 02:58:12.274
You, too, Gomer.

02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:13.281
No can do, sir.

02:58:13.350 --> 02:58:14.317
What's the problem?

02:58:14.385 --> 02:58:15.943
l always said
l wouldn't leave this place

02:58:16.020 --> 02:58:17.282
without getting my limbs back.

02:58:17.354 --> 02:58:18.412
All right, well,
who took them?

02:58:19.990 --> 02:58:22.185
Raggy Angelo,
aisle 6...

02:58:22.259 --> 02:58:24.955
the toughest villain
this side of the board games.

02:58:25.029 --> 02:58:26.792
Now, if l help you
against this Angelo guy,

02:58:26.864 --> 02:58:28.923
can we all hurry up
and blow this dollhouse?

02:58:28.999 --> 02:58:29.829
You got it.

02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:30.730
All right, then.

02:58:30.801 --> 02:58:33.201
Aisle 6--hyah!
Here we come.

02:58:36.841 --> 02:58:37.933
[evil laugh]

02:58:38.008 --> 02:58:39.305
[giggling]

02:58:39.376 --> 02:58:40.741
Aw, mama!

02:58:40.811 --> 02:58:43.006
l swear that clown
was looking mean at me.

02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:44.843
There, at 12 o'clock.

02:58:44.915 --> 02:58:46.280
KElTH:
Raggy Angelo!

02:58:46.350 --> 02:58:47.510
Should l just
run him over?

02:58:47.585 --> 02:58:49.052
Blast you!
Think like a serviceman.

02:58:49.119 --> 02:58:51.019
We've got to take him
head-on.

02:58:51.088 --> 02:58:52.453
Really, l'm, like,
8 times his size.

02:58:52.523 --> 02:58:54.184
l could just,
you know--

02:58:54.258 --> 02:58:57.056
Quiet, soldier!
You and l are going over there.

02:58:57.127 --> 02:58:58.856
All right.
Cover me, Keith.

02:58:59.196 --> 02:59:00.527
You got it!

02:59:00.698 --> 02:59:02.461
l'm not really going to cover him.
l just said l would.

02:59:02.533 --> 02:59:06.299
And l'll inject you all
with pure nitro--oh!

02:59:07.271 --> 02:59:08.499
Ah ha ha ha!

02:59:08.572 --> 02:59:10.062
So we meet again,
Jeremy.

02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:11.402
That's right,
Angelo.

02:59:11.475 --> 02:59:13.067
l see you're still
missing that arm and leg

02:59:13.143 --> 02:59:14.405
that l tore off you.

02:59:14.478 --> 02:59:15.638
l haven't forgotten,

02:59:15.713 --> 02:59:18.409
and l'm ready
to return the favor.

02:59:18.482 --> 02:59:20.416
Now look, Mr. Angelo,
l'm in a hurry here,

02:59:20.484 --> 02:59:22.418
and if l lose me
a date because of this,

02:59:22.486 --> 02:59:23.976
l'll turn you
into a potholder.

02:59:24.054 --> 02:59:25.783
And just who are you?

02:59:25.856 --> 02:59:27.289
l'm Johnny Bravo.

02:59:27.358 --> 02:59:28.985
Well, when l get done
with you,

02:59:29.059 --> 02:59:30.458
you'll be Johnny nothing!

02:59:31.395 --> 02:59:33.022
Wow. That wasn't
even clever.

02:59:33.097 --> 02:59:36.260
Enough of this!
Toys, attack!

02:59:38.068 --> 02:59:39.365
Oh, mama!

02:59:39.436 --> 02:59:41.996
[toys shouting]

02:59:49.914 --> 02:59:52.849
Ah ha ha ha!
Adios, fools.

02:59:54.518 --> 02:59:56.281
Not so fast, Angelo.

02:59:56.887 --> 02:59:58.445
Go, team!
Uh!

02:59:58.522 --> 03:00:00.786
Heads up, Angelo.
You're next!

03:00:02.026 --> 03:00:03.550
Hyahhh...

03:00:03.627 --> 03:00:05.117
Ohh!

03:00:05.763 --> 03:00:06.627
What a spaz.

03:00:06.697 --> 03:00:08.460
JEREMY:
Hyah!

03:00:10.467 --> 03:00:11.559
Aah!

03:00:11.635 --> 03:00:12.567
There.

03:00:12.636 --> 03:00:13.568
Nooo!

03:00:13.637 --> 03:00:15.070
Curse you, Jeremy!

03:00:15.139 --> 03:00:17.107
Now we're even,
Angelo.

03:00:17.174 --> 03:00:20.234
lf you want a new arm, you're going to
have to get it from a share bear.

03:00:20.311 --> 03:00:21.278
Ha ha!

03:00:21.345 --> 03:00:23.779
You'll pay for this!

03:00:25.783 --> 03:00:28.308
Ok, we all set here?
Everybody happy?

03:00:28.385 --> 03:00:29.511
Can we go now?

03:00:29.587 --> 03:00:31.521
Mount up and move out!

03:00:31.589 --> 03:00:33.523
Ha! That's
cowboy talk, Johnny.

03:00:33.591 --> 03:00:35.957
lt means
yes, we can go now.

03:00:36.026 --> 03:00:39.757
Man, remind me never to buy
a discount toy again.

03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:41.627
[panting]

03:00:41.699 --> 03:00:44.133
Hmph! His 10 minutes
are up.

03:00:44.201 --> 03:00:45.793
Let's go, Caroline.

03:00:45.869 --> 03:00:47.200
Ok.

03:00:48.839 --> 03:00:52.775
l'm back,
and l got you 3 nice little toys

03:00:52.843 --> 03:00:54.071
for the kids with empty rooms
foundation.

03:00:54.144 --> 03:00:56.305
Uh! That's pathetic.

03:00:56.380 --> 03:00:58.439
Where'd you get these, anyway,
the discount aisle?

03:00:58.515 --> 03:00:59.948
Come on, Caroline.

03:01:00.017 --> 03:01:01.814
Maybe we can find
someone on the next block

03:01:01.885 --> 03:01:03.876
who isn't such a jerk.

03:01:03.954 --> 03:01:06.548
Well! Shoot! Now what?

03:01:06.624 --> 03:01:11.186
Well, you paid for us, Johnny,
so it looks like we're roomies.

03:01:11.261 --> 03:01:12.558
Ah, great.

03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:14.393
[slurp]

03:01:14.465 --> 03:01:17.434
Johnny, this cereal
is fantastic,

03:01:17.501 --> 03:01:19.594
possibly the best
cereal ever.

03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:21.103
Oh, blast it.

03:01:21.171 --> 03:01:23.401
You'd think with all my training,
l could figure out--

03:01:23.474 --> 03:01:24.406
Aha!

03:01:24.475 --> 03:01:26.306
[beeping]

03:01:26.377 --> 03:01:28.345
Ow!

03:01:28.412 --> 03:01:30.903
You have 6 seconds
of consciousness left.

03:01:30.981 --> 03:01:32.881
Use them wisely.

03:01:35.486 --> 03:01:37.317
Ahh...
