WEBVTT

00:14.875 --> 00:17.708
"From then on,
I knew that nothing changes.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.125
That all things remain.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.000
The spinning wheel turns,

00:23.583 --> 00:25.791
round and round, in a circle.

00:25.875 --> 00:28.291
One fate tied to the next.

00:28.791 --> 00:30.625
A thread, red like blood,

00:30.708 --> 00:33.083
that connects all our deeds."

00:36.791 --> 00:38.791
That was your mother's favorite play.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.000
She surely would have liked
to come with us tonight,

00:43.083 --> 00:46.291
in the company
of such a distinguished young man.

00:51.916 --> 00:54.750
FOR CHARLOTTE

00:54.833 --> 00:56.125
Why do we die?

01:02.375 --> 01:04.583
The dead are never truly dead.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.708
Maybe they're not here, now.

01:08.791 --> 01:10.958
But everything that once lived,

01:11.041 --> 01:12.541
lives on forever.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.625
In the eternity of time.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.958
You there, what are you doing on the road?

01:35.083 --> 01:36.166
I asked what you're doing!

01:50.041 --> 01:51.166
Who is there?

01:53.416 --> 01:54.708
Who are you?

01:58.458 --> 02:00.416
He who has eyes to see

02:01.083 --> 02:02.583
and ears to hear

02:04.458 --> 02:08.458
may convince himself
that no mortal can keep a secret,

02:10.083 --> 02:12.666
because if his lips are silent,

02:13.666 --> 02:16.041
he chatters with his fingertips.

02:18.041 --> 02:21.375
Betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.625
I...

02:24.250 --> 02:25.666
I... I don't understand.

02:25.750 --> 02:27.375
Oh, but you do.

02:30.041 --> 02:32.958
You're going into town
to draft a telegram.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.958
Because you want
to tell the world about us.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.750
Are you not?

02:41.166 --> 02:43.541
You're one of them.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.708
A traveler.

02:49.875 --> 02:51.916
All those years

02:52.041 --> 02:55.041
they said my father was insane.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.958
But now they are here.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.791
The travelers from the future.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.458
The world must know

03:06.500 --> 03:08.500
that they exist.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.416
What we know...

03:13.500 --> 03:14.958
is a drop.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.708
What we don't know...

03:23.208 --> 03:24.666
is an ocean.

05:00.250 --> 05:04.916
ADAM AND EVA

05:05.375 --> 05:07.750
The mistake in all of our thinking is...

05:08.958 --> 05:11.125
that we each believe ourselves

05:11.208 --> 05:13.916
to be an independent entity.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.958
One self...

05:17.666 --> 05:20.333
beside countless other selves.

05:24.541 --> 05:28.166
While in reality, we're all just fractions

05:28.250 --> 05:30.583
of an infinite whole.

05:34.416 --> 05:35.916
What is this place?

05:37.666 --> 05:39.500
A copy of my world?

05:46.208 --> 05:48.916
Do you remember what you said to me?

05:51.541 --> 05:53.000
Under the bridge.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.083
The light.

05:58.666 --> 06:00.000
The forest.

06:01.708 --> 06:02.750
You.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.541
Me.

06:08.791 --> 06:10.708
A glitch in the matrix.

06:17.958 --> 06:19.500
Why am I here?

06:24.875 --> 06:26.291
You and I.

06:28.291 --> 06:29.875
Adam and Eva.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.416
That's what we are.

06:35.041 --> 06:37.500
A glitch in the matrix.

06:41.833 --> 06:44.000
You want to know why you're here?

06:46.666 --> 06:48.208
To save them.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.875
Your world.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.083
And mine.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.375
POLICE

07:00.458 --> 07:03.041
Last night at around 10:00 p.m.,

07:03.125 --> 07:04.625
Kilian Obendorf,

07:04.708 --> 07:08.041
Bartosz Tiedemann, and Franziska Doppler,

07:08.125 --> 07:10.875
along with Magnus and Martha Nielsen,

07:10.958 --> 07:14.541
found an as-yet-unidentified boy's body

07:14.625 --> 07:18.166
on the Doppler property,
by the forest road.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.666
His clothes

07:20.750 --> 07:22.875
and the Walkman are from the 1980s.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.500
We also found...

07:27.916 --> 07:30.500
an ID card on the body.

07:39.791 --> 07:41.583
Wöller, can you continue?

07:44.666 --> 07:46.250
Can I talk to you for a second?

08:00.541 --> 08:02.000
You don't have to do this.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.166
Wöller can do the briefings.
I can go to forensics.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.583
Go home.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.458
I've spent 33 years
looking for my brother.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.458
Those are his belongings.

08:15.166 --> 08:16.791
Those are Mads' belongings.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.166
Someone...

08:20.958 --> 08:22.666
kept them all.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.041
And then put them on the boy
in the bunker.

08:27.958 --> 08:29.708
Thirty-three years later.

08:32.416 --> 08:34.458
You think it was the same killer?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.916
That it's all connected?

08:38.625 --> 08:40.750
Mads, Erik, the boy in the bunker?

08:44.750 --> 08:46.916
Do you know why I joined the police?

08:50.791 --> 08:52.625
When my brother disappeared...

08:57.708 --> 09:00.791
they made pretty much every mistake
you could imagine.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.916
The detective was a drunken moron.

09:04.875 --> 09:05.791
And me?

09:06.416 --> 09:08.666
I swore I'd do it all differently.

09:11.291 --> 09:13.083
That I'd do everything right.

09:14.750 --> 09:16.541
That was 33 years ago.

09:19.916 --> 09:21.166
And what do I do?

09:23.750 --> 09:25.333
My marriage is ruined.

09:27.041 --> 09:31.250
And now I'm cheating on the woman
I cheated on my wife with.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.875
I can't do this anymore.

10:14.166 --> 10:18.375
TANNHAUS
MACHINERY FACTORY

10:29.250 --> 10:30.500
Where were you?

10:34.708 --> 10:36.333
What did she tell you?

10:36.791 --> 10:38.708
We've been stuck here for weeks.

10:38.791 --> 10:40.708
The fucking device is empty.

10:40.791 --> 10:42.958
You have no idea
how any of this shit works.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.416
All you did was lie.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.166
You knew what would happen,
and you told us nothing!

10:47.250 --> 10:49.750
Don't you realize she's just using you?

10:49.833 --> 10:51.291
That isn't Martha.

10:52.791 --> 10:54.083
She's dead.

10:55.416 --> 10:57.166
No one returns from the dead.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.500
Whoever she is...

11:02.666 --> 11:05.583
she may be our only chance
to get out of here.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.333
Why don't you tell us the truth?

11:22.083 --> 11:23.500
Tell them

11:23.583 --> 11:25.666
who really killed Martha.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.916
Bartosz! Wait!

11:49.875 --> 11:51.083
Tell them!

11:54.958 --> 11:57.000
Tell them who Adam really is!

12:16.625 --> 12:18.375
I told you all along!

12:19.166 --> 12:21.083
Jonas is to blame for everything.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.125
It's him.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.750
He's Adam!

12:28.583 --> 12:30.375
He's Adam!

12:44.541 --> 12:47.041
In all of that, didn't you ever wonder

12:47.125 --> 12:49.458
why you can't let go of her?

12:51.166 --> 12:53.583
You know you two are impossible.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.000
Yet still...

12:57.250 --> 12:59.166
you can't let her go.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.208
An invisible bond

13:04.083 --> 13:06.500
that binds you for eternity.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.416
Adam tried to sever it.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.666
But that's impossible.

13:24.541 --> 13:26.166
You gave this to me.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.458
You and I.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.041
Black and white.

13:37.791 --> 13:39.875
Light and shadow.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.625
We are bound together for eternity

13:44.291 --> 13:46.916
in this eternally repeating

13:47.583 --> 13:48.666
déjà vu.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.791
What is all this?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.291
What do you want?

13:56.083 --> 13:58.458
Why don't you just tell me
why I'm really here?

14:00.458 --> 14:02.500
You've seen what you'll do.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.208
What Adam will do.

14:08.708 --> 14:11.125
If you want to save your Martha,

14:12.125 --> 14:14.791
you have to choose the side of light.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.416
And you have to make me what I am today.

14:23.250 --> 14:24.625
I have to?

14:25.708 --> 14:28.166
I don't want to have
to do anything anymore.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.916
I'm sick to death
of always having to do things!

14:34.666 --> 14:36.208
Then ask yourself

14:37.791 --> 14:39.333
what you want.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.750
Do you want her to live?

14:49.583 --> 14:51.041
Your Martha?

15:25.625 --> 15:26.541
Dad?

15:31.666 --> 15:33.125
Can I come in?

15:46.500 --> 15:48.000
Is Magnus here too?

15:49.916 --> 15:51.541
I think he's still sleeping.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.791
You have to tell me the truth.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.708
What really happened in the bunker?

16:05.291 --> 16:06.666
What did you see?

16:08.375 --> 16:10.000
I did tell the truth.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.250
We went in and the bunker was empty.

16:12.791 --> 16:14.291
There was nobody there.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.416
Then there was a light.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.250
And then this...

16:18.333 --> 16:20.500
this body fell down.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.083
Had you taken anything?

16:23.291 --> 16:24.500
What?

16:26.041 --> 16:28.000
Did that Kilian kid give you anything?

16:32.541 --> 16:34.208
Come on, what did you take?

16:34.708 --> 16:36.333
What is this shit?

16:36.958 --> 16:38.958
Are you playing the worried father now?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.958
You usually don't give a shit about us!

16:43.041 --> 16:44.791
It's just as we told you.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.208
There was this noise...

16:46.291 --> 16:49.375
It came from the caves
or the ground, or... I don't know.

16:49.458 --> 16:52.833
We went into the bunker.
At first there was nothing there, then...

16:53.250 --> 16:54.750
he was lying there.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.333
Is that all?

17:02.041 --> 17:05.000
Mom will be back any moment.
You'd better go.

17:06.916 --> 17:10.041
But it was nice of you to drop by
to see how we're doing.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.541
-Hannah.
-Hello.

17:37.625 --> 17:41.291
Is Ulrich here?
I was trying to reach him all morning.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.083
I thought he went home.

17:50.791 --> 17:52.541
You look so different.

17:53.625 --> 17:54.875
Did you get a haircut?

17:57.125 --> 17:58.375
No.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.708
It's nice to see you.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.583
I'll just put this in his office.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.833
Can we talk?

19:34.083 --> 19:35.166
Get lost.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.416
Last night...

19:56.375 --> 19:57.625
in the forest...

19:59.666 --> 20:01.583
Did you see anything else?

20:05.500 --> 20:06.500
No.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.458
Like what?

20:19.166 --> 20:22.083
Do you sometimes feel
like you're losing your mind?

20:24.125 --> 20:25.833
That nothing makes sense anymore?

20:31.708 --> 20:32.750
Maybe...

20:33.583 --> 20:34.958
Dad is right.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.750
Maybe he was already lying there.

20:40.041 --> 20:41.125
And we...

20:45.166 --> 20:46.916
I know what I saw.

21:11.125 --> 21:12.375
Where are you going?

21:13.625 --> 21:15.041
Don't tell Mom.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.750
I'll be back for dinner.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.208
<i>Everything repeats itself,</i>

21:25.791 --> 21:28.375
<i>again and again.</i>

21:29.750 --> 21:31.291
<i>For all eternity.</i>

21:34.500 --> 21:37.333
Because none of us is prepared to let go.

21:51.583 --> 21:54.250
It took me a long time

21:54.750 --> 21:56.333
to understand that.

21:56.833 --> 21:59.750
That you can't let go of your past.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.666
That you will always choose her,

22:03.916 --> 22:06.208
always choose your Martha.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.583
And just as you can't let go of your past,

22:10.666 --> 22:13.833
I've spent my life clinging to mine.

22:17.291 --> 22:19.375
You trusted Adam.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.916
But where did that lead you?

22:27.958 --> 22:29.583
You have to show her

22:30.125 --> 22:32.041
how everything is connected.

22:32.708 --> 22:34.583
You don't have much time left.

22:35.083 --> 22:37.833
She has to see her future
in order to understand

22:37.916 --> 22:39.708
what must be done.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.708
She will follow you.

22:47.958 --> 22:49.833
She is bound to your fate,

22:50.875 --> 22:52.791
just as you are to hers.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.000
You said I was in your world.

24:16.916 --> 24:17.916
With you.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.750
Why can't I remember it?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.375
I don't know.

24:29.583 --> 24:30.666
That letter...

24:33.666 --> 24:35.250
I didn't write it.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.125
You have to believe me.

24:46.041 --> 24:47.291
Sic Mundus...

24:50.583 --> 24:51.708
What is it?

24:58.500 --> 25:00.458
Old Tannhaus' father...

25:02.791 --> 25:05.125
tried to bring someone back from the dead.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.500
His wife.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.833
He was convinced
that the ability to time-travel

25:10.916 --> 25:12.791
would be the world's salvation.

25:14.750 --> 25:17.833
Every mistake could be prevented
before it even occurs.

25:20.416 --> 25:22.166
But it doesn't bring salvation.

25:24.291 --> 25:25.708
Only damnation.

25:28.833 --> 25:30.333
They're all dead.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.500
In my world.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.333
I can't help hoping I can change that.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.875
I know you think you can't trust me.

25:51.291 --> 25:53.375
I want to prove to you that you can.

26:26.208 --> 26:27.375
You traveled with that?

26:39.458 --> 26:41.166
This is the last one I have.

26:43.250 --> 26:45.875
It's the only way I can go back again.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.333
You could have told him
which path you're sending him down.

27:39.666 --> 27:41.250
How it will end.

27:43.208 --> 27:46.791
He will never stop trying
to break this cycle.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.625
He'll never understand

27:52.500 --> 27:54.458
that we must preserve the knot.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.958
That his Martha must die.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.416
So all the others can live.

28:25.458 --> 28:26.916
The beginning...

28:28.666 --> 28:29.875
and the end.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.791
WINDEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
VOLUME CONTROL SYSTEM

29:35.083 --> 29:37.041
Ulrich, it's Charlotte. I...

29:38.375 --> 29:40.208
I just wanted to know how you're doing.

29:41.458 --> 29:42.875
Call me, okay?

31:33.958 --> 31:36.041
Tick...

31:36.708 --> 31:37.833
tock.

31:39.208 --> 31:40.208
Tick...

31:41.750 --> 31:42.833
tock.

32:33.166 --> 32:34.583
I'm here to see Kilian.

32:37.375 --> 32:38.375
Kilian.

32:50.125 --> 32:51.125
Hey.

32:53.208 --> 32:54.416
Hey.

32:56.166 --> 32:57.208
It's okay.

33:01.708 --> 33:03.125
What are you doing here?

33:03.208 --> 33:05.333
You weren't at the dorm. I was worried.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.250
They kicked me out.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.416
Your father called.

33:17.500 --> 33:19.666
He wanted to know
if I slipped you guys something.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.125
-Did you?
-Fuck no! No, I didn't.

33:27.958 --> 33:31.875
But sure, none of you
can get it out of your system.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.666
I haven't lived here for two years,

33:34.750 --> 33:37.541
but I'm still the trailer park trash
everyone points the finger at.

33:39.875 --> 33:41.250
I knew it.

33:41.916 --> 33:43.416
What did you know?

33:44.333 --> 33:46.583
That you were only with me
to rile up your parents.

33:48.458 --> 33:50.583
You don't give a crap about me or Erik.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.666
You'd better go.

34:04.791 --> 34:05.958
Okay.

34:06.583 --> 34:07.583
Okay.

34:38.958 --> 34:40.458
About Regina...

34:42.333 --> 34:43.625
I'm sorry.

34:46.166 --> 34:47.750
It must be difficult for you.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.208
How are you?

34:54.708 --> 34:55.833
Bartosz?

34:56.833 --> 34:58.250
We're managing.

35:03.916 --> 35:04.916
I...

35:08.125 --> 35:10.083
I'd like to propose a deal.

35:12.833 --> 35:13.833
A deal?

35:15.208 --> 35:16.916
I have something that belongs to you.

35:19.125 --> 35:20.291
I'd like to return it.

35:47.458 --> 35:49.000
Do you recognize it?

35:51.083 --> 35:53.666
Don't worry.
The contents are in a safe place.

35:55.125 --> 35:58.083
What do you want? Do you want money?

35:58.708 --> 36:00.000
I don't want money.

36:02.541 --> 36:04.666
I want you to destroy Charlotte.

36:06.958 --> 36:08.666
I want her to lose everything.

36:10.791 --> 36:11.916
Everything.

36:37.666 --> 36:38.833
Charlotte!

36:42.625 --> 36:44.125
What are you doing here?

36:46.041 --> 36:47.041
Thanks.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.041
You've helped me very much.

37:07.208 --> 37:09.000
I tried to get a hold of you.

37:13.541 --> 37:17.166
I went to the bunker.
Why aren't you home with Franziska?

37:19.541 --> 37:20.458
I...

37:28.541 --> 37:30.375
Last night, where was Helge?

37:31.333 --> 37:34.916
You said you ate dinner with him.
Where was he afterwards?

37:37.250 --> 37:38.291
What is this?

37:39.625 --> 37:43.500
In 1987, when you came to Winden,
did your father still live in the cabin?

37:44.875 --> 37:47.125
-I don't understand.
-Did he or didn't he?

37:47.208 --> 37:50.791
No. After the accident
he moved into the nursing home.

37:50.875 --> 37:54.083
-And the summer before, in '86?
-I think so. Why do you want to know?

37:54.166 --> 37:56.000
Did he use the bunker for anything?

37:58.333 --> 38:00.375
Charlotte, what do you want from me?

38:07.166 --> 38:08.541
This is Helge's.

38:09.375 --> 38:11.083
I found it in the bunker.

38:12.583 --> 38:15.583
That... That can't be.
He was with us all night.

38:25.250 --> 38:26.291
Doppler here.

38:29.166 --> 38:30.416
He did what?

38:33.166 --> 38:34.000
Where?

38:34.875 --> 38:36.291
Yes.

38:36.375 --> 38:37.916
Yes, I'll be right there.

38:41.083 --> 38:41.916
Helge.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.166
He's at the police station.

38:47.666 --> 38:49.458
He made a confession.

38:52.291 --> 38:56.791
POLICE

38:57.125 --> 38:58.666
Dad, why are you saying this?

38:59.541 --> 39:01.000
It makes no sense at all.

39:04.625 --> 39:06.416
He didn't leave the house.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.541
I was with him all evening.

39:08.625 --> 39:10.166
Elisabeth was there, too.

39:10.250 --> 39:12.458
I killed the boy.

39:13.375 --> 39:15.500
-Dad, cut it out!
-His things...

39:16.208 --> 39:18.083
The Walkman. The clothes.

39:18.958 --> 39:23.500
Those are Mads Nielsen's things,
the boy who disappeared in 1986.

39:24.291 --> 39:25.791
Do you remember that?

39:27.708 --> 39:29.666
I killed him.

39:29.750 --> 39:31.458
Who? Mads?

39:34.333 --> 39:36.083
Where did you get his stuff?

39:36.291 --> 39:38.416
What did you do to Mads?

39:38.500 --> 39:39.916
What did you do to him?

39:40.375 --> 39:41.208
You're alive.

39:41.625 --> 39:43.833
-What?
-It was you.

39:43.916 --> 39:46.083
What was me?

39:46.166 --> 39:47.541
It was him.

39:47.625 --> 39:49.000
What? Get off me!

39:50.875 --> 39:52.458
It was him.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.125
-What are you saying?
-It was him!

40:00.416 --> 40:03.291
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
1986

40:25.541 --> 40:26.500
What is this?

40:30.375 --> 40:31.583
Are you following me?

40:33.958 --> 40:36.041
Why won't you tell me
how we know each other?

40:39.125 --> 40:41.166
Actually, we've always known each other.

40:47.416 --> 40:50.333
When Magnus knocked your tooth out
in kindergarten...

40:53.250 --> 40:54.375
I was there.

40:58.416 --> 41:01.708
When Mikkel put spiders in your shoes
while camping in the yard...

41:07.625 --> 41:10.041
On the third grade class trip...

41:13.250 --> 41:16.291
when you were so homesick
that Katharina had to come get you.

41:23.583 --> 41:25.208
Where I come from,

41:26.250 --> 41:28.791
you and I have the same past.

41:33.208 --> 41:34.416
You're nuts.

41:37.208 --> 41:39.000
I know that you saw yourself.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.583
Last night in the forest.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.166
You told me about it.

41:44.250 --> 41:46.000
Your future self did.

41:48.041 --> 41:49.000
What?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.833
I know how completely insane
this all sounds.

41:57.916 --> 42:00.916
For the longest time
I too thought it was all totally crazy.

42:03.250 --> 42:04.500
That I was crazy.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.125
Who are you really?

42:10.500 --> 42:11.625
I can show you.

42:15.083 --> 42:16.958
How it's all connected.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.750
Where's Martha?

47:41.291 --> 47:43.416
LET THERE BE LIGHT

48:24.416 --> 48:28.375
SEPTEMBER 23, 2053

49:23.583 --> 49:25.583
So you gave it to him?

49:38.958 --> 49:40.958
I always was too gullible.

49:50.083 --> 49:52.041
You did the right thing.

50:31.708 --> 50:33.166
What is this place?

50:47.041 --> 50:48.458
Where are we?

50:49.500 --> 50:51.083
How did you do that?

50:52.208 --> 50:54.250
She told me to bring you here.

50:55.916 --> 50:57.541
That she'd explain it to you.

50:58.416 --> 50:59.500
Who?

51:15.166 --> 51:16.333
Who is that?

51:44.333 --> 51:46.375
Welcome to the future.

55:41.083 --> 55:44.958
