WEBVTT

00:03.461 --> 00:06.380
A cross won't repel them.
Sunlight won't kill them.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.799
The blood lust, that part's true.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.552
That's vampire blood he dosed you with.

00:11.719 --> 00:15.848
- Lights too bright, sunshine hurts skin.
- I get so hungry.

00:16.682 --> 00:20.019
- Just so you know, 911 is on speed-dial.
- Krissy, you can trust me.

00:20.228 --> 00:23.523
Your dad's on the road. Been gone a while.

00:24.148 --> 00:27.443
My dad left and he didn't come back
so I'm coming with you.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.362
- Hell no.
- I'm coming.

00:29.570 --> 00:31.822
Why is that waitress
getting into the truck?

00:31.989 --> 00:34.825
All right. Come on, give it up. Good work.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.744
You're a dweeb.

00:38.996 --> 00:40.581
Hold on, I got you.

00:40.748 --> 00:43.459
- Dean.
- He can't help you. No one can.

00:44.961 --> 00:48.339
- Uhn!
- Guess I'll have to help myself, then.

00:50.174 --> 00:51.801
I'm retiring.

00:52.677 --> 00:55.596
- We're so lame.
- Yeah, we are. Take care of yourself.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.652
It's cold outside
And I'm not quite

01:09.819 --> 01:14.282
Ready for the morning light

01:15.366 --> 01:17.994
Oh, oh, oh

01:19.662 --> 01:23.040
My hands are tied
'Cause if I tried

01:23.207 --> 01:28.379
To leave this place
I'll surely die

01:34.010 --> 01:40.057
Hey, hey, hey I'll surely die

01:40.224 --> 01:41.267
What was that?

01:42.643 --> 01:44.437
What?

01:47.189 --> 01:49.025
There's no one out here but us, Krissy.

01:49.233 --> 01:53.446
Hey, hey, hey I'll surely die

01:53.654 --> 01:55.239
What?

01:55.865 --> 01:58.367
I'll surely die

02:26.604 --> 02:31.359
No. No. Don't leave me here.
Aidan! Don't leave me here.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.028
Oh, God.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.757
You okay?

02:55.216 --> 02:59.887
That was close.
Next time one of you can be the bait.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.436
It's him.

03:08.771 --> 03:13.526
One down. Two to go.

03:35.673 --> 03:36.966
So what are we looking at again?

03:40.761 --> 03:43.764
Two women found near the freeway
with their throats ripped out.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.475
- Sounds vampy to me.
- Yeah, maybe.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.939
If you wanna take a knee on this one
if you're not feeling up to it...

03:52.565 --> 03:54.191
What?

03:54.358 --> 03:58.154
You know, the trials. What Cass said.
That you got what he can't cure.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.406
Which means what, exactly?

04:00.573 --> 04:02.408
I don't know. You tell me. You okay?

04:02.950 --> 04:04.827
I'm fine. Are you okay?

04:05.578 --> 04:08.956
- Me?
- Yeah. Cass dinged you up pretty good.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.417
And?

04:12.209 --> 04:14.336
And I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

04:15.546 --> 04:19.841
- What, like my feelings?
- If that's what you wanna talk about, sure.

04:25.097 --> 04:28.100
Okay. I'll tell you what.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.853
- Why don't we go get some herbal tea?
- Okay.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.439
- Find Cowboy Junkies on the dial.
- Eat me, Dean.

04:33.606 --> 04:37.610
And you know what? We'll just talk it out.
Good talk.

04:38.277 --> 04:42.740
Nay, great talk. Very healthy.

04:44.074 --> 04:47.661
FBI. You're here about the
lady-killer murders, aren't you?

04:47.828 --> 04:49.872
The lady-killer murders?

04:50.039 --> 04:53.417
- Yeah, coined it myself.
- Congratulations. What can you tell us?

04:53.584 --> 04:57.463
Well, both victims were female, under 21...

04:57.838 --> 05:01.634
...and here's the kicker,
they were drained of all their blood.

05:02.092 --> 05:04.053
- Huh.
- Exactly.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.431
We found that strange also.
But then last night...

05:07.598 --> 05:10.059
- ...things got even stranger.
- Last night?

05:10.226 --> 05:14.355
We'd set up a security camera
on Fuller's Point, for safety purposes.

05:14.522 --> 05:19.735
It's where our local young people like to
go make out. Last night, things got crazy.

05:25.324 --> 05:27.409
Hell of a thing, ain't it?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.954
You ID any of these people?

05:30.287 --> 05:34.500
Well, not yet. Crime scene was empty
when we got there. No vic, no nothing.

05:34.750 --> 05:40.172
Uh... I'm thinking it's some kind of cult
or a drug thing.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.219
So I put a statewide APB out
on these three about an hour ago.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.931
Gonna need you to call that off.
And we're gonna need this footage.

05:49.348 --> 05:53.185
- What?
- Sheriff, why do you think we're here?

05:53.352 --> 05:56.772
You crossed with a federal investigation.
I suggest you cooperate...

05:56.939 --> 06:00.359
...call off your APB, or you're gonna
find yourself in a world of hurt.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.282
Right.

06:07.616 --> 06:11.328
- So, what was that all about, G-man?
- You remember Krissy Chambers?

06:11.579 --> 06:15.249
The Vetalas case, right? They were
working that truck stop by the freeway...

06:15.416 --> 06:17.126
...she and her dad helped us
shut them down.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.045
He promised to go civilian
so she wouldn't be a hunter.

06:20.212 --> 06:22.923
- Guess who the star of this snuff film is?
- Come on.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.509
Well, maybe he doesn't know
she's doing this.

06:25.801 --> 06:27.928
Sneaking out at night to hunt monsters...

06:28.095 --> 06:31.223
...with the Apple Dumpling Gang?
Is that what kids do for kicks?

06:31.390 --> 06:35.102
- Maybe he knows and he's helping her out.
- What, get caught on Candid Camera?

06:37.187 --> 06:40.649
Let's just go find her
before she gets into any more trouble.

06:46.822 --> 06:49.033
You're 25?

06:52.703 --> 06:54.872
Actually, I think I'm 40.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.940
I told you I have a boyfriend.

07:21.106 --> 07:24.276
Then how come I couldn't find him
in your cellie?

07:24.610 --> 07:26.195
Because we only Skype.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.531
Right. And let me guess,
he also lives in Canada?

07:29.698 --> 07:34.036
Yeah, he does, actually.
A small town called kiss my ass.

07:36.705 --> 07:38.248
Okay.

07:39.083 --> 07:44.129
But you sure were giving off
a different vibe in the car.

07:44.588 --> 07:48.425
Good, you're back. Let's do this.

07:51.553 --> 07:55.474
Vamp was last seen by an ATM camera
checking into this hotel.

07:55.641 --> 08:00.104
I tapped into the hotel's security cams
and found him. Room 215.

08:00.270 --> 08:02.064
Okay.

08:03.899 --> 08:07.653
- Let's do this.
- You transmitting?

08:08.195 --> 08:09.363
You bet.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.408
He alone?

08:12.741 --> 08:13.826
I can't tell.

08:14.493 --> 08:17.204
Hey, how about we start a new tradition...

08:17.371 --> 08:22.126
...and before each job
we give each other good luck kisses?

08:23.460 --> 08:26.171
How about I punch you
in the throat instead?

08:42.062 --> 08:45.899
You know you're not gonna get anywhere
with Krissy with those cheesy moves.

08:46.066 --> 08:50.612
How about you stop putting salt in my
game and mind your own business?

09:00.998 --> 09:02.791
Blood?

09:29.818 --> 09:31.737
Hey, Krissy.

09:32.696 --> 09:35.699
- What are you two doing here?
- Saving your bacon, that's what.

09:36.366 --> 09:38.952
Does it look like my bacon needs saving?

09:40.662 --> 09:44.166
Wait, how did you find me?
I paid cash everywhere.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.295
Only two hotels in a 20-mile radius
and we paid cash too. Just more.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.048
Freaking clerk.

09:51.673 --> 09:53.175
Krissy, where's your dad?

09:53.967 --> 09:55.552
Dead.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.890
Well, let's do this again, like, never.

10:00.474 --> 10:03.102
Now go. We got this.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.979
We, who? And got what?

10:09.566 --> 10:10.901
A vampire.

10:11.985 --> 10:13.695
Sorry. A what?

10:17.157 --> 10:21.495
We're in.
Room's clear. Nobody here but a vic.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.021
I got him.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.440
Son of a bitch.

10:50.607 --> 10:52.151
- Call an ambulance.
- On its way.

10:52.317 --> 10:56.071
She's in shock. I'll stabilize her.
We'll leave her here for the paramedics.

11:00.033 --> 11:02.619
Please, don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.
Please, don't.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.458
Please, God, it hurts so bad.

11:10.335 --> 11:13.797
- How did you drop him so quickly?
- Darts filled with dead-man's blood.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.885
- Where's the blue van?
- What blue van?

11:18.051 --> 11:21.096
The blue van that he was
Usain Bolt-ing it to.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.931
Never mind.

11:24.349 --> 11:25.559
Wait, stop.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.562
This is not your kill.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.190
What are you talking about?

11:31.690 --> 11:34.484
Three months ago
this blood banger snuck into a house...

11:34.651 --> 11:38.906
- ...and killed three people in their sleep.
- What? No, I didn't do that.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.533
One was a woman...

11:41.992 --> 11:43.452
Never hurt anyone!

11:44.912 --> 11:49.708
The other two, a brother and a sister.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.128
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:53.503 --> 11:57.007
I came home from a friend's house
and I found them.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.970
They were my family.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.764
This isn't happening.

12:04.223 --> 12:08.810
I didn't do anything, I swear.
Please, help me.

12:28.455 --> 12:30.374
It's okay.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.919
It's over.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.342
I need to talk to you. Privately.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.228
You know this guy?

12:51.395 --> 12:54.648
Yeah, we have a past.

12:59.945 --> 13:03.323
All right, so you're gonna have to
catch me up. What, did your dad...?

13:03.490 --> 13:05.867
- Couldn't quit the life, could he?
- No, he did.

13:06.034 --> 13:10.122
For a while it was amazing.
We had dinner every night at a table.

13:10.622 --> 13:14.710
We watched TV. Went on walks.
Even went to the mall.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.713
And then?

13:18.380 --> 13:22.384
And then the past came knocking.

13:23.176 --> 13:25.429
I woke up one morning and found him dead.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.766
His throat ripped out.

13:33.186 --> 13:34.896
Well, I'm sorry.

13:36.773 --> 13:38.442
Me too.

13:39.735 --> 13:43.864
If it weren't for Josephine and Aidan,
I don't know how I would've made it.

13:45.115 --> 13:48.618
- So they both lost their families as well?
- Yeah.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.622
Same vamps we're hunting together. A nest.

13:54.082 --> 13:58.712
Well, look, I am sorry to rain on your parade,
but you are too young to be doing this.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.506
You're never too young to kill monsters.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.633
Especially ones that kill your family.

14:03.800 --> 14:09.348
Hunting isn't all about killing and revenge.
I thought we had this chat last time.

14:10.724 --> 14:14.019
Do you have any...? Do you have any
family that's still out there?

14:14.770 --> 14:18.690
- An aunt in Cincinnati. Why?
- Because you're packing a bag...

14:18.857 --> 14:22.235
- ...and we're taking you there.
- Victor will have a problem with that.

14:22.694 --> 14:23.779
Victor?

14:24.279 --> 14:27.199
He took us in,
showed us everything we know.

14:28.408 --> 14:31.995
Wait, so what are we talking here?
Some sort of kids' school for hunters?

14:32.162 --> 14:35.624
Don't be such a dweeb, okay?
We're not the X-Men.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.711
- Victor's helping us get revenge.
- I don't care what he is, he sucks.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.215
Because you and your crew got caught.
If it wasn't for me...

14:43.382 --> 14:45.967
- ...your faces would be all over the news.
- So what.

14:46.134 --> 14:49.096
It's time that people know
what's going bump in the night.

14:49.262 --> 14:53.475
Oh, and cause panic? Create mayhem?
Yeah, that's a great plan.

14:53.725 --> 14:58.730
Look, I don't need you to save me, Dean.
I'm not a little kid anymore.

15:07.614 --> 15:10.075
- What happened?
- Teenager, that's what.

15:10.325 --> 15:12.994
- She tell you about Victor?
- Yeah. What do we think?

15:13.161 --> 15:16.415
Didn't we meet up with a hunter
named Victor one time in Spokane?

15:17.082 --> 15:20.293
That's a long time ago.
I haven't heard about him since.

15:22.796 --> 15:26.007
- So these kids are...?
- Dangerous and off their meds? No kidding.

15:26.174 --> 15:29.928
So what, we go and talk with Victor?

15:30.929 --> 15:32.180
All right.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.224
Okay.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.249
Not what I'd call a compound.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.563
- Huh.
- What's wrong?

16:21.771 --> 16:23.023
It's just not what I expected.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.692
And what was that?

16:25.942 --> 16:28.445
A little more Lord of the Flies,
less Huxtables.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.032
Sorry to disappoint.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.825
Victor Rogers.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.954
We met, a Rugaru hunt in Washington.
I'm Sam, this is Dean.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.999
- Oh, yes. The Winchesters.
- Right.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.175
- Better now?
- Much.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.843
And what do we always say?

16:52.010 --> 16:55.430
- Move on, but never forget.
- Good.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.891
Now, don't you have a trig test
in the morning?

17:00.352 --> 17:04.564
Oh, I'm good, Vic. No test. I'm
gonna chill. Play video games.

17:04.731 --> 17:09.528
Keep dreaming. I asked you to clean your
room twice and you haven't done it. Go on.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.280
And you.

17:12.446 --> 17:15.407
Full report about the hunt
on your desk by morning.

17:16.284 --> 17:18.578
- Okay, I'll be in my room.
- All right.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.705
Drink?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.376
Sure.

17:25.417 --> 17:29.756
So these kids go to school?
Like "school" school? Real school?

17:30.632 --> 17:34.511
Yes. And they're doing incredibly well,
considering all they've been through.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.346
Okay, so how does this work?

17:36.513 --> 17:39.849
After... After soccer
practice the bake sale...

17:40.058 --> 17:42.102
...they chop vampires' heads off?

17:42.477 --> 17:45.981
Well, yeah, I think a balanced approach
is best, don't you?

17:47.148 --> 17:48.608
They're kids.

17:48.858 --> 17:50.569
They shouldn't be hunting at all.

17:50.735 --> 17:52.404
You gotta break this up right now.

17:52.946 --> 17:56.616
When I found them,
they were lost, confused, angry.

17:56.783 --> 18:02.539
I give them family and purpose,
and you wanna take all that away? Why?

18:02.706 --> 18:04.082
So they don't get killed.

18:06.334 --> 18:08.628
- They know the risks.
- Yeah, but why take them?

18:08.795 --> 18:11.047
Because the next generation of hunters
has to be better.

18:11.214 --> 18:14.217
- Better than what?
- Better than us.

18:15.176 --> 18:21.224
Come on, guys, I know your friends.
I mean, Martin was insane...

18:21.391 --> 18:24.519
...and somebody obviously dropped Garth
on his head when he was a baby.

18:24.686 --> 18:28.231
I know you two loved Bobby,
but he was a barely functional alcoholic.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.899
Watch it.

18:30.191 --> 18:35.488
No disrespect, but Josephine is an all-state
athlete and National Merit Scholar.

18:35.655 --> 18:39.409
Aidan is so fast he could pick your pocket
before you could blink.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.996
And Krissy, well, she's just a
natural-born leader and hunter.

18:43.163 --> 18:46.291
- So what?
- So these kids are the cream of the crop.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.960
They are the Beatles.
They are the Dream Team.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.046
And once they get their revenge...

18:52.756 --> 18:55.759
...they'll be better hunters
than any of us ever dreamed of.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.515
This is crazy.

19:02.682 --> 19:06.436
- Is it? They got a pretty good life.
- Kids aren't supposed to hunt, Sam.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.772
- We did.
- Yeah, look what that did for us.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.691
Maybe they're right.
Maybe they can hunt and have a life.

19:11.858 --> 19:14.194
- That's not true.
- Because it didn't work for us?

19:14.361 --> 19:17.864
- It doesn't work for anybody.
- Okay. Then what do you wanna do?

19:18.031 --> 19:20.408
Because Victor's not gonna stop this.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.078
- They said they were hunting nests, right?
- Yeah.

19:23.244 --> 19:24.746
Then let's hunt it for them.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.667
That way, until we figure out
what to do with Victor, they stay safe.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.796
All right, um, so what's your move?

19:33.088 --> 19:36.883
I'll talk to that girl tied up at the
hotel. Something didn't smell right.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.303
Why don't you stay here
and look after the Brady Bunch?

20:21.094 --> 20:24.472
Sam, just in time, grab a seat.

20:24.806 --> 20:27.183
- Waffles?
- Yeah. Krissy's fave.

20:27.350 --> 20:29.561
My dad used to make them
for me all the time.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.439
I think it was the only thing
he knew how to cook.

20:37.068 --> 20:39.320
- Interact.
- Yeah, nerd.

20:39.487 --> 20:42.323
And you. Manners.

20:42.657 --> 20:44.117
We're gonna be late.

20:49.205 --> 20:50.373
Grab your stuff.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.626
- I'll pick you up after school.
- Yeah.

20:54.669 --> 20:56.755
- Wow.
- Ahem. Whirlwind, right?

20:56.921 --> 20:59.007
- Yeah.
- It's always like that with kids.

20:59.507 --> 21:01.718
- You got any?
- Me? Uh, no.

21:02.135 --> 21:05.889
- You want any?
- Uh, I don't know.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.393
Trust me...

21:10.560 --> 21:12.479
...the answer is yes.

21:13.104 --> 21:15.857
- These yours?
- Yeah.

21:16.357 --> 21:20.528
Well, until we went camping
and a Wendigo ripped them to shreds.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.825
Sorry.

21:28.077 --> 21:31.873
Is that why you're doing this?
Taking all these kids in?

21:33.082 --> 21:35.460
But you know what I realized, Sam...

21:35.627 --> 21:38.922
...is that these kids,
they don't have to live it the way we have.

21:39.088 --> 21:45.011
You know, crappy hotel rooms.
Always moving. No family. No life.

21:46.095 --> 21:47.597
It's not the only way.

21:51.017 --> 21:55.230
Like I told the cops already, I'm not sure
why Jimmy Day would do something like this.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.191
Jimmy Day? Wait.
So you knew the guy that grabbed you?

21:58.817 --> 22:02.779
Everyone in town knows Jimmy. He's a hero.

22:03.363 --> 22:06.658
We had a parade for him downtown
when he came back from Afghanistan.

22:06.825 --> 22:10.703
Sorry. When was this?

22:11.704 --> 22:12.789
A few weeks ago.

22:14.749 --> 22:18.795
So this Jimmy Day guy, he just grabbed
you and took you to the hotel?

22:19.212 --> 22:24.425
No, I came from work and was in the parking
lot when this blue van pulled up.

22:24.592 --> 22:27.720
This guy with a hoodie asked me directions.

22:28.471 --> 22:30.890
That's all I remember
until I woke up tied to that bed.

22:31.057 --> 22:32.851
And was Hoodie there too?

22:33.017 --> 22:35.645
Just Jimmy, and he was crying...

22:36.229 --> 22:39.357
- ...saying he was sorry and all.
- That he was sorry?

22:39.732 --> 22:43.778
At first I thought he was gonna kill me,
then he just...

22:44.821 --> 22:46.489
He just seemed scared.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.214
Hey, what happened to school?

23:04.007 --> 23:06.593
- Victor pulled us out.
- He... Why?

23:06.759 --> 23:09.470
Because we found another target.

23:09.637 --> 23:12.599
- Who?
- Vamp that killed Krissy's dad.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.145
You ready?

23:20.106 --> 23:25.028
Okay. Pulled this from a security camera
at a nearby gas station.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.823
Wait, how do we know
this is definitely her?

23:29.324 --> 23:32.702
Police sketch, victim's accounts.

23:35.538 --> 23:37.290
And this.

23:43.087 --> 23:45.965
My dad's necklace.

23:48.176 --> 23:51.763
Mom gave it to him on their anniversary.

23:57.101 --> 24:01.814
- You sure this is a video surveillance pic?
- It's her.

24:05.401 --> 24:06.694
Excuse me.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.866
- Hey. You there?
- Yeah. How'd it go with the girl?

24:12.533 --> 24:15.119
Strange. Might be that
vampire wasn't lying.

24:15.286 --> 24:17.664
He was fresh-made within the month...

24:17.830 --> 24:20.625
...but Josephine's family was murdered
three months ago.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.752
- So who killed them, then?
- I don't know.

24:22.919 --> 24:27.966
I'd like to talk to whoever's driving
that blue van. Other than that, you?

24:28.132 --> 24:32.804
Victor says he has a surveillance photo of
the vampire that killed Krissy's father...

24:32.971 --> 24:36.099
- ...but, Dean, I'm not so sure.
- Why's that?

24:36.641 --> 24:40.019
- There's no time stamp on it.
- Okay. So you think he's lying?

24:40.853 --> 24:45.525
- That or he's just wrong. It's hard to say.
- I never trust a guy who wears a sweater.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.527
- You want me back there?
- No, I'm good.

24:47.694 --> 24:52.115
- Let me do some more digging.
- I'll talk to the hotel clerk, see what he knows.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.423
Hey, where'd everybody go?

25:08.589 --> 25:09.716
Tracking that vamp.

25:10.091 --> 25:13.302
Well, I think we got a problem
a lot closer to home. Look at this.

25:16.097 --> 25:19.851
See that blue van? My brother saw
it outside the hotel yesterday.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.979
We think he's working
with the vampire we popped.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.148
Looks like we're going hunting.

25:28.317 --> 25:31.529
- Ah. Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, I bet.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.825
Listen, I need to know
who checked into Room 215 yesterday.

25:37.660 --> 25:40.997
It was some guy wearing a hoodie.
It was hard to make out his face.

25:41.164 --> 25:46.377
- He drive a blue van by any chance?
- Do I look like a valet?

25:48.796 --> 25:50.757
He took one of those.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.429
- Which one?
- One that says lodge on it.

25:59.974 --> 26:01.851
Conway Springs Lodge?

26:02.018 --> 26:05.688
Yup, big during the summer season,
but this time of year it's closed.

26:05.855 --> 26:09.442
- How far away is it from here?
- It's a couple miles down the road.

27:31.065 --> 27:33.276
Hey! Who the hell are you?

27:35.236 --> 27:36.279
Answer me.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.574
Please make it go away, it hurts so much.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.325
What?

27:44.912 --> 27:46.831
No, shut them off. They're too bright.

27:46.998 --> 27:51.002
- Not until you tell me what's going on here.
- I don't know. Aah!

27:51.794 --> 27:53.462
What's happening to me?

27:53.629 --> 27:55.214
Come here.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.134
- That's never happened to you before?
- No.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.470
There's something wrong with me.
That guy, he did something to me.

28:01.637 --> 28:02.847
- What guy?
- I don't know.

28:03.014 --> 28:06.058
This guy in a blue van.
He grabbed me, he took me here.

28:06.517 --> 28:10.146
Oh. Oh, my stomach. It hurts so much

28:10.730 --> 28:12.398
Dean!

29:21.175 --> 29:22.718
Put those away and we can talk.

29:26.681 --> 29:29.016
Why are you with the vampire
that killed my Dad?

29:29.350 --> 29:31.060
You're barking up the wrong tree.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.312
She didn't kill your pops.

29:34.105 --> 29:37.692
I don't want to hurt you, Dean.
But I will if you don't move.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.071
Listen to me, Krissy.

29:43.155 --> 29:44.782
She's innocent.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.414
- And how would you know that?
- Because she's fresh-made.

29:51.789 --> 29:54.667
A day or two.
Her dad was killed months ago.

29:56.210 --> 29:57.461
This whole thing stinks.

29:58.421 --> 30:02.883
That vamp that we killed last night?
Why was he swearing he didn't do it?

30:03.050 --> 30:04.176
Because he was a liar.

30:05.761 --> 30:08.639
Vampires don't beg for their lives,
they attack.

30:09.807 --> 30:11.142
Last time I'm gonna ask nicely.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.477
Take the damn guns off me
or somebody's gonna get hurt.

30:13.894 --> 30:16.230
- Big talk.
- I know, it is, isn't it?

30:23.070 --> 30:25.406
Let's say this isn't the vamp
who killed my dad.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.327
She's still a monster and deserves to die.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.412
Not if we can save her.

30:32.788 --> 30:35.499
- What?
- She hasn't fed yet.

30:36.042 --> 30:38.419
We can reverse this if we find her maker,
get his blood.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.629
Why should we care about her?

30:42.256 --> 30:45.509
Like I said,
hunting isn't always about killing.

30:45.676 --> 30:48.721
Oh, please. Preach to some other choir,
we're not buying it.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.431
You wanna kill an innocent girl?

30:53.684 --> 30:56.270
I want the bloodsucker who
killed my dad to pay.

30:57.688 --> 31:00.107
And we're gonna find out who that is.

31:00.441 --> 31:03.027
But let's not be so bloodthirsty
that anyone will do.

31:03.444 --> 31:06.113
- But Victor says it's her.
- And I say it ain't.

31:07.365 --> 31:11.118
So we're gonna pack her to go,
and we're gonna ask Victor ourselves. Okay?

31:26.759 --> 31:30.971
You're awake, good.
We don't have much time.

31:31.972 --> 31:34.809
- For what?
- Picture this.

31:39.188 --> 31:41.273
The kids arrive home victorious...

31:42.400 --> 31:45.528
...only to find you, dead,
in their living room.

31:46.237 --> 31:51.742
Seems that nest of vampires
they were hunting was seeking revenge.

31:54.453 --> 31:56.622
And killed you.

31:56.789 --> 31:59.917
Thus, inspiring them to hunt even more.

32:01.627 --> 32:04.964
I'm sorry, Sam. I can't have anyone
poisoning my kids' minds.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.924
Other than yourself, that is.

32:07.466 --> 32:11.929
I don't need to justify my actions to you
or your self-righteous ass of a brother.

32:15.724 --> 32:18.018
You mean like why you're working
with a vampire?

32:20.312 --> 32:22.815
So what's he get out of this?
Free roaming rights?

32:23.399 --> 32:27.194
We are at war. A war that we are losing.

32:28.946 --> 32:32.450
That Leviathan fiasco was a wakeup call.

32:32.616 --> 32:36.662
We have to do what we can to survive.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.251
But I wouldn't expect you to understand.

32:43.544 --> 32:46.881
You're not a father.
You don't know what it's like...

32:48.257 --> 32:52.261
...to hear the cries of
your children dying.

32:54.638 --> 32:59.101
But now I have a second chance
to make it all right.

32:59.393 --> 33:04.690
To create the next generation of hunters.
Stronger. Faster. Smarter.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.943
Hey, we're home.

33:18.245 --> 33:19.788
What is going on here?

33:20.664 --> 33:23.083
These two are not to be trusted.

33:23.250 --> 33:24.752
They're trying to destroy us.

33:27.004 --> 33:29.173
Do you know this vamp, Victor?

33:29.548 --> 33:32.343
Of course he does. They're
working together.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.220
Is that true?

33:40.518 --> 33:41.852
It's complicated.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.813
No, actually, it's not.

33:45.105 --> 33:47.608
See, Blue Van here has been
turning fresh vamps...

33:47.775 --> 33:50.194
...and setting them up for you kids
as easy kills.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.987
But why?

33:53.155 --> 33:57.576
Because they didn't kill our families,
did they?

33:59.537 --> 34:01.080
No.

34:03.082 --> 34:05.000
- Well, then who did?
- I did.

34:06.168 --> 34:08.545
And they all screamed...

34:09.129 --> 34:11.257
...and begged for mercy.

34:11.422 --> 34:14.217
- Especially the little ones...
- Enough, Seth!

34:15.886 --> 34:17.804
You have to understand.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.933
I saw a way to make the future better.

34:21.433 --> 34:23.476
To get there, I had to do something hard.

34:25.688 --> 34:29.525
- He killed them off your orders?
- You needed motivation.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.277
I scouted each and every one of you.

34:32.610 --> 34:34.530
I knew it was the only way
to get you to hunt.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.532
So you killed our families?

34:38.701 --> 34:40.703
I know the deaths are tragic.

34:41.954 --> 34:45.583
But think of all the future lives
that will now be saved...

34:45.748 --> 34:47.293
...because you are now together.

34:47.458 --> 34:51.839
These fake vampires were just a way for you
to train us and fill our heads with lies?

34:52.005 --> 34:53.924
Don't you see?

34:54.632 --> 34:56.092
This is bigger than all of us.

34:58.012 --> 35:02.224
We have to learn
to put things in perspective.

35:04.018 --> 35:08.147
Come with me. We can get past this.

35:18.490 --> 35:20.951
That is unfortunate.

35:22.119 --> 35:23.662
Aidan!

35:27.041 --> 35:29.710
- We're leaving.
- That's not happening.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.755
I taught you everything you know.

35:33.130 --> 35:35.174
Don't make me hurt you.

35:36.008 --> 35:38.719
Not everything, Victor.

35:50.230 --> 35:52.316
Krissy, don't.

35:55.569 --> 35:59.031
If we want revenge for our families'
deaths, he gives it to us.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.699
We don't kill people.

36:02.576 --> 36:04.411
You don't kill people.

36:04.578 --> 36:07.665
He's not a person, he's a monster.

36:09.583 --> 36:11.418
Krissy, this ends bad no matter what we do.

36:12.002 --> 36:13.379
Exactly.

36:18.384 --> 36:21.011
Krissy, don't.

36:25.641 --> 36:26.892
This is for my Dad.

36:28.977 --> 36:30.896
For Josephine's family.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.190
For Aidan.

36:33.857 --> 36:34.900
For me.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.960
- So we're just gonna let him live?
- Yeah.

36:53.127 --> 36:56.714
All alone. With himself.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.842
No family. No friends.

37:00.634 --> 37:02.553
Ask me, that's not much of anything.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.601
Let's save that girl.

37:16.775 --> 37:18.485
Gun!

37:37.171 --> 37:40.340
Just drink slowly.
This will take away all the pain.

37:48.932 --> 37:51.685
- I'm proud of you.
- Shut up before I punch you.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.774
- So how's she doing?
- Better now.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.276
Well, uh...

38:02.738 --> 38:03.947
Think this is yours.

38:08.535 --> 38:09.745
Thank you.

38:12.122 --> 38:14.249
I'll wait outside.

38:17.044 --> 38:20.756
Okay. Whenever you're ready,
we'll be in the car.

38:20.923 --> 38:23.592
- What are you talking about?
- Your aunt.

38:23.759 --> 38:27.554
Cincinnati? Normal life?
We'll be there by lunch tomorrow.

38:27.721 --> 38:31.558
Look, I hate how we were
put together, but...

38:31.725 --> 38:36.313
...I can't deny that it feels right.
Why should I let Victor ruin that too?

38:37.356 --> 38:40.442
You're saying you like that boy over there,
and you wanna stay?

38:40.901 --> 38:42.778
What, Aidan? No.

38:42.945 --> 38:46.907
I mean, he's like my brother.

38:47.991 --> 38:49.451
It's nothing like that.

38:50.702 --> 38:53.997
- Well, you're all still minors.
- Not for long.

38:54.164 --> 38:58.085
Josephine will be 18 in a few months, we're
gonna have a life and each other here.

38:58.961 --> 39:02.130
- And hunting?
- We won't go looking for it.

39:02.297 --> 39:07.678
But if any monsters show up around here,
they better look out.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.643
- Okay, good.
- Really?

39:15.310 --> 39:17.980
I thought I was gonna have to fight you
way more on that.

39:18.146 --> 39:21.942
You're right, you're not a kid anymore.
You can make your own decisions.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.487
You're all right for an old guy.

39:25.946 --> 39:29.491
- I'm really not that old.
- You keep telling yourself that.

39:29.658 --> 39:30.784
Hmm.

39:31.702 --> 39:35.289
I'm gonna have a guy come check on you
every once in a while.

39:35.455 --> 39:39.251
His name is Garth. He'll make sure
you're all right and you got what you need.

39:39.418 --> 39:40.878
- Garth?
- Yeah.

39:41.044 --> 39:43.922
He's a little strange at first,
but you'll come to love him.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.056
Take care, Dean.

39:59.396 --> 40:01.899
Yeah, goodbye, Dean.

40:03.483 --> 40:05.152
Aidan.

40:08.113 --> 40:10.532
There's something I wanna tell you
about Krissy.

40:10.699 --> 40:13.994
I know, I know. You'll kill me if I
ever hurt her. Blah, blah, blah.

40:14.161 --> 40:17.039
No, no. No. She'll kill you.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.503
Good luck.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.139
This is good.

40:34.306 --> 40:37.059
- Is it?
- Could have been a lot worse.

40:37.225 --> 40:39.728
It will be if we don't
shut those gates of hell soon.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.897
What do they have to do with any of that?

40:42.064 --> 40:45.651
They're hunters now.
You don't just walk away from that.

40:45.817 --> 40:49.154
There's only one way out of that.
You and I both know it ain't pretty.

40:49.988 --> 40:51.323
Maybe they'll be different.

40:52.824 --> 40:56.453
If we shut that hellhole once and for all,
those three can have a real life.

41:00.707 --> 41:02.793
Maybe they won't be the only ones.
