[clamoring stops]

00:40.740 --> 00:42.575
One at a time. Go.

00:42.675 --> 00:46.713
The contamination occurred
approximately 8 hours ago
at 11:39 p.m.

00:46.780 --> 00:47.914
Pump Station 4.

00:48.014 --> 00:49.416
It's the main
distribution point,

00:49.516 --> 00:51.217
down channel from
the Moulton filter turbines,

00:51.284 --> 00:52.952
feeds directly
into all five boroughs.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.687
Do we know
what this stuff is?

00:54.754 --> 00:56.623
Apparently, it's some kind of
unidentified hallucinogen.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.959
It's presenting
at a high concentration:
.09 parts per million.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.394
That doesn't sound so bad.

01:01.461 --> 01:03.029
It's bad.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.931
If it were salt,
it'd taste like you were
drowning in the ocean.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.766
It's completely flavorless
and odorless.

01:06.866 --> 01:08.368
You wouldn't even know
it was there.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.804
We need to issue
a citywide alert,
tell the people--

01:10.904 --> 01:12.806
Tell them what?
There's LSD in the water?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.240
We don't even know
what we're dealing with.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.109
I'll tell you
what we're dealing with:

01:16.209 --> 01:19.045
50,000 gallons of water
in use the first 2 hours
of the breach.

01:19.112 --> 01:22.215
That went up 4%
every hour until 6:00 a.m.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.117
It's over 200% now.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.252
Half the city's population
has ingested that water.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.254
If even 1% of them drank it,

01:28.321 --> 01:31.458
we've got six million people
in Gotham, that's what?

01:31.558 --> 01:32.992
Sixty thousand people.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.628
[Fletcher] We've got problems.

01:35.728 --> 01:38.731
We got a shotgun assault
at JT Liquor over on Boylston,

01:38.798 --> 01:40.400
we've got a double homicide
on 3rd Street,

01:40.467 --> 01:43.169
we got warehouses
all over the east side on fire.

01:43.269 --> 01:46.306
Every one of those people
drank the water.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.174
Commissioner,
we're spread pretty thin.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.843
You might want to call in
off-duties,

01:49.943 --> 01:51.611
and you might wanna start
approving some overtime.

01:51.678 --> 01:52.645
Yeah, do it.

01:52.745 --> 01:54.347
Okay.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.349
I've got a call
with the mayor in ten,
what do I tell him?

01:56.449 --> 01:57.984
[exhales]

01:58.084 --> 01:59.085
What are our options?

01:59.152 --> 02:00.353
Shut off the water.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.088
Flush the system,
drain it into the bay.

02:02.155 --> 02:05.325
-How long would that take?
-A good job? Four, five days.

02:05.425 --> 02:08.361
You can't shut off water
to six million people
for five days.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.536
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.471
You all right?

02:18.538 --> 02:21.107
A little bit of brain fog
from the accident,
but I'm feeling better now.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.709
All right.
Anything new out there?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.345
We scanned the city
up and down. Nothing.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.313
Senator McDonald's
office just called.

02:27.380 --> 02:30.116
The Feds are sending in
the National Guard.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.818
Good. We could use the help.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.520
No, they're not here to help.

02:33.620 --> 02:38.024
They're sealing off the city.
No one in or out.

02:38.124 --> 02:42.362
All right. Get down to the DWP.
Take back-up and a warrant.

02:42.462 --> 02:45.532
I want that water
shut off, now.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.233
With pleasure, Commissioner.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.706
[Jason] What the fuck is this?

02:53.806 --> 02:57.744
[Crane] This is where
the victors go
to rest their weary heads.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.312
[Jason] We didn't win.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.381
They were gonna take me back,
but you fucked it all up.

03:01.481 --> 03:02.482
[Crane] So you had a moment.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.517
I've had plenty of them myself.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.419
Let bygones be bygones.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.487
I forgive you.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.113
Sit.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.726
-You know
who Edward Bernays is?
-The sauce guy?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.695
Eggs and bacon.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.797
Classic American breakfast.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.599
-Do you know why?
-What does this
have to do with--

03:52.699 --> 03:55.902
Pork farmers paid
Edward Bernays to make it so.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.371
See, but Edward Bernays,
he had this...

03:58.438 --> 03:59.539
This uncle, right?

03:59.606 --> 04:01.541
Dear old Uncle Sigmund.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.376
As in Sigmund Freud.

04:03.443 --> 04:07.614
See, and Freud
taught Edward Bernays
how the human mind worked.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.049
And Edward,
he worked the human mind.

04:10.116 --> 04:13.419
He didn't
sell the proletariat bacon.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.755
He sold them the idea
that a hearty breakfast

04:15.822 --> 04:18.324
was what every doctor thought
was best for them.

04:18.424 --> 04:21.628
After that, the bacon,
it sold itself.

04:21.728 --> 04:27.100
Edward Bernays understood
that an idea is the most
powerful weapon we have.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.505
[keyboard clacking]

04:32.605 --> 04:37.076
It's not the product,
it's how you sell it.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.812
And Gotham is in need
of a new product.

04:41.914 --> 04:44.684
We now interrupt
your regularly
scheduled program

04:44.784 --> 04:49.789
to bring you a message
for the good people of Gotham.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.353
It's not good.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.021

<i>Nightwing done?</i>

actually believe that shit.

what they need to believe.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.123
They're scared.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.524
And Crane just gave
their fear a target.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.363
[sighs] Okay, how many people
do we think have been affected?

06:37.430 --> 06:39.465
Thousands.

I mean, anybody who's drank
from the municipal water supply
in the last eight hours.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.269
Not everyone, right?

then it's all over.

Even when things
were at their worst,

06:56.249 --> 06:59.886

that Bruce and my dad
would be there for them.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.487
And we will be, too.

National Guard's shutting down
every bridge and tunnel
in and out of Gotham.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.742
You might have told me that
at the airport.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.207
I need your support.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.677
We have to stick together
or all of this
is just gonna fall apart.

13:31.777 --> 13:32.845
[cellphone vibrating]

13:38.150 --> 13:39.552
Harris just died on the table.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.826
[Lydia] Earn your passage.

13:49.228 --> 13:51.530
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

13:54.733 --> 13:57.169
Why was I able
to defeat you before?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.076
I've been dead for a while.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.178
You reacted with fear.

14:06.245 --> 14:09.048
Uncertainty, like a human.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.750
I'm not afraid of you, Lydia.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.353
No, you're afraid of yourself.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.196
[blade swishing]

14:28.667 --> 14:30.870
[indistinct rock music
playing over speakers]

14:33.105 --> 14:34.039
[man] Thank you.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.212
[Dick] Hey.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.680
[Barbara] Hey.

14:41.747 --> 14:43.349
[Dick] Is it safe here?

14:43.415 --> 14:46.285
I got guys
on four corners outside, so...

14:47.519 --> 14:48.621
Safe as we can be.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.955
[waitress] Anything
for you guys?

14:50.055 --> 14:51.423
Uh, I'm fine
with coffee, thanks.

14:51.523 --> 14:52.758
Shot of absinthe, please.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.794
Jesus. Really?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.864
I'm running out of good ideas.
Resorting to bad ones.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.633
There's an art gallery
around the corner, too,

15:00.733 --> 15:03.302
if you want to go heist a Monet
for old time's sake.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.572
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.807
Cheers.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.315
So, um--

15:16.415 --> 15:18.651
Do you remember that place
you had on Temple,
with the rain gutters?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.986
Yeah. The ones that you broke.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.955
Got me into your room,
didn't it?

15:23.055 --> 15:25.090
I got the scars on my hand
to prove it.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.129
So, you said
that you had a plan.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.566
I'm gonna turn myself in.

15:34.633 --> 15:38.003
Make a show of it
at the GCPD, as Nightwing.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.072
God, you really are
out of good ideas.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.742
I need to show the people
I'm not working
with Gotham Police.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.911
Give the city's trust
back where it belongs.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.913
With you.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.083
Then what?
We put Nightwing on trial?

15:51.150 --> 15:52.918
It'll never get that far.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.453
I'll pay bail and disappear.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.490
Work out of sight,
just like always.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.359
Except this time
with the Titans.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.860
I don't like it.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.164
I don't like it either, Barb,
but it's the best I got.

16:06.165 --> 16:07.199
[waitress] Another one?

16:07.933 --> 16:08.934
Sure.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.004
Make it two.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.677
So, this art gallery
of yours...

16:19.845 --> 16:21.146
they got any Rembrandt?

16:21.213 --> 16:23.015
[chuckles]

16:23.115 --> 16:25.284
I'll do it for a Rembrandt.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.553
[Crane] I know a painter
shouldn't be charmed
by their own brush,

16:27.653 --> 16:29.388
but fuck me running.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.789
Police outnumbered,

16:31.557 --> 16:33.058
the Titans are MIA.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.494
-For now.
-What?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.197
What did you say?

16:38.297 --> 16:39.198
For now.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.234
Where's the optimism?

16:42.334 --> 16:44.003
Where's the vision?

16:44.069 --> 16:47.740
I thought we're gonna
give the people some hope,
a new way.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.311
[sighs]

16:55.748 --> 16:56.749
I get it.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.055
I get it.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.225
This is your home.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.061
Familial fires still burn.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.262
But buck up, Jay.

17:11.430 --> 17:15.267
There is rebirth
in dissolution.

17:15.367 --> 17:19.371
It's a shit cracker of a place,
but it was mine.

17:19.438 --> 17:20.873
And it still is yours.

17:22.341 --> 17:24.042
When they write the history
of Gotham,

17:24.109 --> 17:26.945
the final chapter is going
to be titled "Red Hood."

17:28.881 --> 17:30.282
Batman is just a footnote.

17:32.084 --> 17:35.287
A Salieri to your Mozart.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.889
They'll always want Batman.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.358
Or the other Robin.

17:40.759 --> 17:41.794
Not anymore.

17:43.462 --> 17:44.463
It's you.

17:46.265 --> 17:47.266
Finally.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.436
-It's you.
-[sighs]

17:51.403 --> 17:52.438
I don't know.

17:54.573 --> 17:58.544
Well, look,
if this canvas is too grand--

17:58.610 --> 18:00.579
Fuck you
and your grand bullshit.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.315
I'm here, aren't I?

18:03.415 --> 18:07.386
I need you committed
100% to this. 100%.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.655
Like I said, I'm here.

18:09.755 --> 18:14.460
You need to believe in you,
in your ascendancy,

18:15.761 --> 18:17.062
in your legacy.

18:19.731 --> 18:20.732
Red Hood.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.502
Say it with me.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.404
-Red Hood.
-Red Hood.

18:25.471 --> 18:28.841
-Red Hood.
-Red Hood.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.275
-Red Hood!
-Red Hood!

18:33.178 --> 18:34.179
Red Hood.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.190
What do you want me
to do with this?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.026
Go shopping.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.297
[cellphone ringing]

18:59.605 --> 19:00.839
[Molly]<i> Jason, are you there?</i>

19:02.474 --> 19:03.642
Please talk to me.

19:04.676 --> 19:05.944
You're scared of me.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.013
<i>I was.</i>

19:09.314 --> 19:11.383
Now I'm scared for you.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.318
Have you seen
what's happening out there?

19:13.852 --> 19:15.287
[scoffs]

19:15.354 --> 19:17.456
Yeah. I'm aware.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.358
<i>I saw the video.</i>

19:20.359 --> 19:22.728
None of this is making sense.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.364
But Jay, you've always
been there for me.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.199
Let me be here for you now.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.001
How?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.869
<i>Let's go.</i>

19:31.837 --> 19:32.871
Leave Gotham.

19:32.971 --> 19:34.873
<i>What do you mean, leave?</i>

19:34.973 --> 19:38.177
I mean, pack up our shit,
get the fuck out of here
and never look back.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.578
<i>And go where, Molly?</i>

19:39.678 --> 19:43.015
<i>Who cares?</i>
<i>Oregon, Alaska, Arizona.</i>

19:45.350 --> 19:46.585
Hawaii?

19:46.685 --> 19:48.820
[chuckles] Yes, sure.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.191
Anywhere but here.

19:54.426 --> 19:55.727
[sighs] I can't.

19:56.662 --> 19:57.729
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

19:58.497 --> 19:59.498
We can.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.234
Red Hood...

20:03.068 --> 20:04.670
<i>That's not who you are.</i>

20:05.704 --> 20:06.939
You don't know that.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.040
I do.

20:13.111 --> 20:15.113
This is something I have to do.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.551
I don't get it.

20:20.352 --> 20:21.186
<i>I know.</i>

20:23.388 --> 20:25.090
But this is all I have left.

20:28.427 --> 20:30.529
<i>You're one of the few</i>
<i>good people that I know.</i>

20:31.897 --> 20:33.532
Don't let Gotham take that.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.435
You should go.

20:36.535 --> 20:37.803
<i>-Jason--</i>

20:53.418 --> 20:54.453
[sighs]

21:03.829 --> 21:06.665
So we turn ourselves in
and then what?

21:06.765 --> 21:09.801
And then we post bail,
continue doing our work,

21:10.669 --> 21:12.337
but in a less public way.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.141
Work in the shadows,
take this city back
night by night.

21:16.241 --> 21:19.678
It's not gonna be easy,
and it's not gonna be fast,
but we can do it.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.080
If you have a better idea,
please, now's the time.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.349
They hate us.

21:24.449 --> 21:28.320
They've been manipulated
into hating us, by Crane.

21:28.420 --> 21:31.623
Conner, Blackfire,
what do you think?

21:32.791 --> 21:34.960
It was brutal out there.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.695
I don't wanna be looked at
like that again.

21:38.964 --> 21:42.134
Well, surrender isn't my thing.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.040
But I am used to people
looking at me
like I'm a monster,

21:48.140 --> 21:52.444
so whatever you all decide on,
I'm in.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.448
Kory?

21:56.515 --> 22:00.552
We've played it
by the book so far
and this is where it's led us.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.221
So maybe you're right.
Maybe we try a new way.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.124
I'm in.

22:12.297 --> 22:14.399
All right, then.
Let's suit up.

22:16.468 --> 22:17.536
We go in together.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.873
As a team. As a family.

22:37.589 --> 22:40.092
You can't avoid
who you are, Donna.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.493
You must confront it.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.596
And still you run.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.167
[both grunting]

23:18.196 --> 23:22.901
I know you've always hated me
because I'm part human.

23:22.968 --> 23:27.606
To you, it had
always made me... less.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.643
[both grunting]

23:44.923 --> 23:47.826
If you keep doing things
the way you always have,

23:48.794 --> 23:50.162
you will die again.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.331
First, my daughter Angela,

23:54.433 --> 23:55.467
then you.

23:57.002 --> 23:59.337
I could not survive that again.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.973
I push you to be more
because you are more.

24:02.073 --> 24:05.177
You are of your world
and my world.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.279
That makes you the best of us.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.515
I'm... I'm so sorry, Lydia.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.118
Do not be sorry.

24:13.985 --> 24:15.353
Be stronger.

24:17.155 --> 24:20.692
You were born not just
to protect people, Donna...

24:22.694 --> 24:23.962
but to lead them.

24:24.796 --> 24:25.964
You must rise.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.624
So, it's his day
with his daughter.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.392
He lets her do make up
all over his face.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.061
That's how he robs the bank.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.898
-Whoa!
-[man] What the fuck?

25:01.299 --> 25:02.901
[Red Hood]
You know what to do.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.569
There's more
where that came from.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.505
[shushing]
It's okay. It's okay.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.148
So you're him, right?

25:21.686 --> 25:22.754
[bag unzipping]

-[exhales]
-[Red Hood] Say it.

25:32.430 --> 25:33.832
Say my name.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.275
Red Hood.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.222
On Tamaran,
it is called the Pit.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.359
It's dark.

26:04.195 --> 26:07.399
So dark you cannot even see
your hand.

26:11.636 --> 26:13.071
It isn't like that here.

26:14.873 --> 26:16.641
Right?

26:16.741 --> 26:20.111
Right. Totally not like that.

26:20.211 --> 26:23.315
It's gonna be fine.
Dick and Barbara have a plan.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.917
We're just gonna go in and out.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.652
This is really
just all for show.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.323
We're gonna be together
the whole time.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.225
I've got you, I promise.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.597
-[siren wailing]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

27:09.961 --> 27:11.696
[Starfire]
This seems excessive.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.799
Barbara cleared it with me.
It's all for show.

27:14.866 --> 27:17.669
They need
to stand their ground.

27:17.769 --> 27:20.639
Looks more like
a funeral procession
than a perp walk.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.174
This is just optics, right?

27:24.976 --> 27:26.044
Optics.

27:39.691 --> 27:41.292
Let's just get this over with.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.570
-[grunts]
-Move along.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.538
I got you.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.742
Back off.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.310
Easy.

27:59.377 --> 28:01.012
We're not here for a fight.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.347
Move in!

28:02.414 --> 28:03.481
[grunting]

28:03.548 --> 28:04.649
Stand down!

No!

29:13.785 --> 29:15.420
I need to get her out of here.
Cover us.

29:15.487 --> 29:16.955
Shit. Go!

29:24.095 --> 29:25.096
[groans]

29:27.098 --> 29:28.099
[grunting]

29:32.470 --> 29:34.773
Fletcher, put down
your weapon.

29:35.907 --> 29:36.941
Put it down!

29:55.126 --> 29:56.861
We gotta get
out of here. Now!

30:05.937 --> 30:07.839
-Where are the others?
-They're gone.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.887
[Blackfire groans]

30:28.893 --> 30:29.894
Okay.

30:32.063 --> 30:33.131
Stay with me.

30:37.702 --> 30:38.870
What are you doing?

30:38.970 --> 30:40.205
I have to try.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.141
I hope this works.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.588
What's going on?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.089
What are you doing?

30:58.189 --> 30:59.190
Let go!

30:59.891 --> 31:00.892
[grunts]

31:10.535 --> 31:12.570
What the hell did you just do?

31:13.404 --> 31:14.672
I didn't do anything.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.275
You did this.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.910
You took my powers.

31:20.245 --> 31:22.780
I was dying, Koriand'r. You--

31:22.881 --> 31:23.915
I was healing you

31:25.049 --> 31:26.684
and you took everything.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.588
Was this your plan all along?

31:30.688 --> 31:35.193
To make me care about you,
to get close to you,
so you could steal my powers?

31:35.260 --> 31:36.895
Why would you say that?

31:36.961 --> 31:39.597
You tried to steal the throne
and you failed.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.468
Now everything you want
can be yours.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.969
You're being ridiculous.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.605
None of this is what I wanted.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.044
What's it gonna take
for you to trust me?

31:53.111 --> 31:54.646
[woman screams in distance]

31:54.746 --> 31:55.780
[indistinct yelling]

31:59.584 --> 32:00.785
We can't stay here.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.889
Let's find somewhere safe.
Just us.

32:06.758 --> 32:10.428
We can talk,
fix whatever this is.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.898
I'm going to help the others.

32:13.965 --> 32:15.433
Haven't you given them enough?

32:17.435 --> 32:20.471
You are a queen, Koriand'r.

32:20.571 --> 32:23.975
You were never meant
to be a soldier
in someone else's army.

32:24.075 --> 32:28.413
A family, Blackfire,
not an army.

32:28.479 --> 32:30.281
I am your family.

32:31.149 --> 32:33.117
I'm not gonna abandon them.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.154
They wouldn't do this to me.

32:36.254 --> 32:37.822
After what just happened?

32:37.922 --> 32:39.457
Oh, you're fooling yourself.

32:41.592 --> 32:42.627
Yeah, maybe.

32:44.529 --> 32:45.863
But I've decided.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.034
What if something happens
to you?

32:51.970 --> 32:55.373
Who will heal you then, sister?

32:56.941 --> 32:58.810
I'll take my chances.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.547
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

33:07.185 --> 33:08.186
I don't.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.689
Where are you going?

33:11.789 --> 33:14.058
You're not the only one
with unfinished business.

33:15.860 --> 33:16.894
[sighs]

33:28.840 --> 33:29.907
[breath trembling]

33:35.713 --> 33:36.748
I'm sorry.

33:44.155 --> 33:45.256
Yeah. Me too.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.829
Commissioner, I'm gonna
need your weapon.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.071
[sniffles]

34:05.343 --> 34:07.612
Barbara Gordon,
you have the right
to remain silent.

34:07.712 --> 34:12.850
Anything you say can
and will be held against you
in a court of law.

34:12.917 --> 34:14.185
You have the right
to an attorney.

34:14.252 --> 34:16.120
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

34:16.220 --> 34:21.626
one will be appointed for you
before any questioning
if you wish.

34:21.726 --> 34:26.464
<i>If you decide</i>
<i>to answer questions now</i>
<i>without an attorney present,</i>

34:26.564 --> 34:33.037

<i>to stop answering at any time</i>
<i>until you talk to an attorney,</i>

34:33.104 --> 34:38.376

<i>your rights as I have</i>
<i>explained them to you.</i>

34:38.443 --> 34:42.480

35:30.962 --> 35:33.164
I'm afraid I don't have
my wallet on me.

35:33.264 --> 35:36.167
Orders are
no entry without ID,
so you'll have to turn around.

35:36.267 --> 35:37.535
Gotham's closed for business.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.470
Ah, good old Gotham.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.305
Always rolling out
the red carpet.

35:41.372 --> 35:42.840
Is there a problem, ma'am?

35:42.940 --> 35:45.376
[exhales] Starting with
"ma'am," yeah.

35:45.476 --> 35:49.046
But the main point is,
I traveled a long way
to get here,

35:49.147 --> 35:51.182
crossed a lot of bridges.

35:51.282 --> 35:54.552
I know it might seem crazy,
me wanting to get into
a steaming heap like Gotham,

35:54.652 --> 35:56.320
but turns out I do.

35:56.387 --> 36:00.791
So, basically, turning around
is not an option.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.327
Turn around, ma'am.

36:03.394 --> 36:05.029
Or we will take you in.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.034
[crackling]

36:15.339 --> 36:16.474
Been there, done that.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.877
See, I knew
you were gonna go there.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.181
[soldier coughs]

36:26.918 --> 36:27.885
You gonna let me in now?

36:42.266 --> 36:44.535

-[helicopter blades whirring]

36:53.110 --> 36:55.213
[voices whispering]

37:03.521 --> 37:04.522
Rachel?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.428
Did I die again,
or are you really real?

37:10.528 --> 37:14.799
Of course I'm real.
Are you hurt or just sleepy?

37:14.899 --> 37:21.405
I think I have a hole
where the dart shot me.

37:23.107 --> 37:24.475
I think I'm fine.

37:26.644 --> 37:28.646
How did you find me?

37:28.746 --> 37:32.083
I could just feel you,
your energy.

37:33.985 --> 37:37.321
I started at GCPD,
ended up here.

37:41.459 --> 37:42.493
[groans, grunts]

37:50.268 --> 37:51.736
What happened out there?

37:51.802 --> 37:53.404
Crane and Jason happened.

37:56.440 --> 38:00.911
They turned the whole city
against us, even the cops.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.085
Things went real bad real fast.

38:11.088 --> 38:12.323
Where are the others?

38:12.423 --> 38:13.457
I don't know.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.493
Where are we?

38:23.167 --> 38:25.369
-[Superboy] Still nothing?
-[Nightwing] Lines are down.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.706
Barb shot a cop.
She's gonna need our help.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.841
She's the Commissioner,
she'll be all right.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.545
Any luck with the others?

38:34.645 --> 38:35.880
[sighs] I got
the same message.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.482
Like everything's shut down.

38:38.549 --> 38:41.152
Dick, I think
we should go home.

38:41.218 --> 38:43.688
Red Hood and the cops
know about Wayne Manor.

38:43.788 --> 38:45.523
It's the one place we can't be.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.060
So let's go outside,
help some people out.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.330
Look, I wish we could,
but right now, our only job
is to not get caught.

39:00.037 --> 39:01.672
Gotham City's on its own.

39:11.048 --> 39:13.684
[Crane] So this is what
a billion dollars gets you.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.321

[scoffs] Interior designers
the world over exclaim, "Meh!"

39:26.564 --> 39:29.333
All right, enough with
the whole tortured hero stuff.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.402
Come on,
we have reached the summit.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.504
It's time for us
to enjoy the view.

39:34.605 --> 39:36.774
I think this calls
for some spirits.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.113
Look, let's make a toast.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.748
[drink pouring]

39:43.848 --> 39:45.082
To bad seeds.

39:48.786 --> 39:49.954
To being them.

39:50.921 --> 39:51.889
To knowing them.

39:53.190 --> 39:54.291
To growing them.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.359
[glass clink]

40:00.131 --> 40:01.298
We gotta redecorate.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.770
Starting with this.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.388
Actually, you should
do the honors.
