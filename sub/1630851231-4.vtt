going to show up or not.

I almost gave up.
- I almost didn't,

00:37.385 --> 00:40.736
but I couldn't help myself.
-

00:40.779 --> 00:42.825
I get it.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.696
It feels wrong
for guys like you.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.181
Don't fight it.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.710
I want to make you
feel so good.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.304
- See you, T.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.966
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:37.009 --> 01:40.274
Church on a weekday.
I'm impressed.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.928
- Yeah, well, not exactly.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.540
It's a memorial service
for my father.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.195
He passed a year ago today.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.588
- Oh, I'm sor--I didn't know.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.243
Are you okay?

01:53.287 --> 01:55.637
- No, I'm good.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.161
My mom passed
two years before him,

01:58.205 --> 02:01.251
so I kind of got
this grief thing on lock.

02:01.295 --> 02:05.168
- Okay, but you know
if you ever need to talk...

02:05.212 --> 02:07.127
- Oh, thanks, but I'm good.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.737
I know talking
about our personal lives

02:08.780 --> 02:12.044
is not really our thing.
- It isn't?

02:12.088 --> 02:15.091
- No.
- Oh, come on, since when?

02:15.135 --> 02:18.050
- Since we met.
- What? We talk.

02:18.094 --> 02:21.271
We're talking--isn't that
what we're doing right now?

02:21.315 --> 02:22.229
- Sure.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.496
Oh, wait.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.845
Oh, we just got a case.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.282
Jubal wants us to head
straight to crime scene.

02:41.204 --> 02:44.251
Um, I'll liaison with ERT
if you want to get an update.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.774
- I'm Sergeant Mitchell.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.123
You the ones
taking the handle on this?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.777
- Affirmative. Agent Scola.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.822
My partner over there
is Agent Wallace.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.998
What do you know so far?
- Not much.

02:53.042 --> 02:55.218
Witness who called it in
is a nature photographer.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.394
Thought he'd tripped over
a fallen tree limb.

02:57.438 --> 03:00.223
Called 911 when he realized
it was a partially buried arm.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.877
I've already
taken his statement

03:01.920 --> 03:04.184
which I can forward to you.
- Any chance he's involved?

03:04.227 --> 03:06.577
- No. Based on
the composition of the dirt,

03:06.621 --> 03:09.667
the body was buried
sometime early this morning,

03:09.711 --> 03:10.712
and he just flew in
on assignment

03:10.755 --> 03:12.888
from Nat Geo a few hours ago.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.325
- No excess blood around
the body or in the soil.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.501
I think he was killed
somewhere else.

03:17.545 --> 03:20.156
- Gonna be honest here,
we've never dealt with

03:20.200 --> 03:22.463
something like this before.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.247
- Any luck identifying
the victim?

03:24.291 --> 03:26.684
- No. I went through
his pockets,

03:26.728 --> 03:29.252
found a few condoms
and some cash but no ID.

03:29.296 --> 03:32.255
- Kay. Hopefully DNA and prints
will give us some answers.

03:32.299 --> 03:36.781
- Scola, you got to see this.
- What do you got?

03:36.825 --> 03:38.218
- Four more graves.

03:44.267 --> 03:47.270
- Dog alerted on all of them?
- Yeah.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.359

putting in some serious work.

<i>♪</i>

03:53.407 --> 03:56.758
- Take a good look, folks.
DNA is in and our recently

03:56.801 --> 03:58.673
discovered serial killer
appears to have a type--

03:58.716 --> 04:00.414
young, black, and homeless.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.893
Most of these young men

04:01.937 --> 04:03.852
had prior drug
or prostitution charges

04:03.895 --> 04:05.288
in and around the West Village.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.029
All were stabbed in the neck.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.379
None, and this saddens me
to say--

04:09.423 --> 04:12.991
had been reported missing
by friends or relatives, so...

04:13.035 --> 04:14.863
let's dig in extra hard, huh?

04:14.906 --> 04:16.430
Since nobody else
really seemed to care.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.301
Go to work.
- Do we have any

04:18.345 --> 04:20.825
security footage we can scrub
from the park or the roads?

04:20.869 --> 04:22.131
- None to speak of yet.

04:22.174 --> 04:23.611
- Hey, Jubal.
- Yeah?

04:23.654 --> 04:25.917
- I think we got something.
This is from a nature cam

04:25.961 --> 04:27.354
that was installed
three days ago

04:27.397 --> 04:29.791
to monitor animal crossings.
Good news for us

04:29.834 --> 04:31.401
is that it gives us
a clear view of the road

04:31.445 --> 04:34.230
less than a half mile
from the burial site.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.232
The only vehicle
that was captured

04:36.276 --> 04:39.191
was this blue cargo van
with no plates.

04:39.235 --> 04:42.717
Time stamp has it leaving
the park early this morning.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.632
- Can we get a facial rec hit
on the driver?

04:44.675 --> 04:46.286
- I've tried. Angle's bad.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.939
- All right so blue cargo van,
no plates.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.506
That help anybody?

04:49.550 --> 04:51.291
Well, we'll work
with what we've got,

04:51.334 --> 04:53.510
which admittedly is not
a whole hell of a lot.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.251
What can we ascertain about
the guy's physical attributes?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.992
Elise, you want to help me out?

04:57.035 --> 04:58.428
- Based on the height
of the van,

04:58.472 --> 05:00.343
specs on the interior,
estimate the seated subject

05:00.387 --> 05:01.823
is about 5'10".

05:01.866 --> 05:03.172
Hoodie is form-fitting.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.130
The guy is obviously fit
so he probably weighs

05:05.174 --> 05:07.219
about 170 pounds.
- Meaning he's probably

05:07.263 --> 05:08.960
a lefty based on
the dominant use

05:09.004 --> 05:10.527
of that hand on
the steering wheel.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.442
- Somebody talk to me
about the most recent victim,

05:12.486 --> 05:14.662
Rob Holden.
- 20 years old.

05:14.705 --> 05:17.273
Born in Hazard, Kentucky.
He's got three priors

05:17.317 --> 05:19.275
for solicitation.
Two in the West Village.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.147
Reports indicate that he picked
up his johns at local clubs.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.062
- O--okay so we need to
start pulling

05:24.106 --> 05:25.499
security footage from
bars in the West Village.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.283
Ian, you want to--
- Sir?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.416
Yeah.
- Hey, do we know when

05:29.459 --> 05:30.982
the first victim was killed?

05:31.026 --> 05:33.376
- ME's office says it was
about two weeks ago.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.510
- So this guy
is striking every few days.

05:36.553 --> 05:39.077
Let's dig in and get this guy
before he strikes again.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.427
- NYPD seems to think
they found

05:40.470 --> 05:41.819
the killer's vehicle
in Brooklyn.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.169
- Any sign of the suspect?
- Uh, negative.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.736
They're sitting on it
until ERT gets there.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.651
- All right, you two,
grab Maggie and OA.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.349
Get some answers fast.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.093
- Stolen three weeks ago
over in Queens.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.400
No security cams or witnesses
to the theft.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.184
- Okay, can you arrange
for the owner of the vehicle

05:59.228 --> 06:00.664
to come down, check the front,
see if there's anything

06:00.708 --> 06:01.883
in there that doesn't
belong to him?

06:01.926 --> 06:04.189
- Not a problem.
Lot of blood in that van.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.410
- All right, we need
a thorough sweep of the van.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.020
If there's a shred of DNA
from our suspect in there,

06:09.064 --> 06:10.108
we're counting on you guys
to find it.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.545
- Yes, ma'am.

06:11.588 --> 06:12.763
- Okay, we'll take
the east side of the block.

06:12.807 --> 06:13.808
You guys want to canvass
the west?

06:13.851 --> 06:15.244
- Copy that.
We'll radio you

06:15.287 --> 06:16.637
if we find something.
- Okay, we'll do the same.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.554
- Excuse me.
- You guys asking about

06:20.597 --> 06:22.556
that van the cops were
messing with down the street?

06:22.599 --> 06:23.861
- Yeah, did you see
anyone by it?

06:23.905 --> 06:25.646
- Sure did.
Saw a suspicious looking guy

06:25.689 --> 06:27.604
climb out of the back of it
when I opened up this morning.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.737
Had a shovel and
some other stuff in his hands.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.391
Figured he was up to no good.
- Did he get in a car,

06:31.434 --> 06:33.305
or he walk off by foot?
- He walked

06:33.349 --> 06:35.264
straight into that warehouse
at the far end of the block.

06:35.307 --> 06:37.788
Been abandoned for years.
Haven't seen him walk out,

06:37.832 --> 06:40.269
so maybe he's still in there.
You didn't hear that from me.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.879
- Uh, thanks,
but doesn't work that way.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.795
We'll be back to chat
after we check it out.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.144
- Maybe we should wait
for backup.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.494
- Eh, we got this.

right.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.743
Maybe we should've waited

they were a couple of runaways.

08:49.790 --> 08:50.834
What about the guy
with the shovel?

08:50.878 --> 08:52.357
- Currently homeless.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.663
Just got out of jail
two days ago.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.447
Definitely not our guy.
- Why was he in the van?

08:55.491 --> 08:57.406
- Found it unlocked.
Rifling through,

08:57.449 --> 08:59.190
looking for stuff to sell.
- Hey.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.453
Just spoke to the owner
of the stolen van.

09:01.497 --> 09:02.846
The shovel isn't his.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.108
- So we're gonna send it
to the lab for analysis.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.067
Hopefully we can get
some prints or some DNA.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.548
- Doesn't look that old.
- Maybe the JOC can run down

09:08.591 --> 09:11.159
where it's sold.
We'll get lucky.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.422
- Profile's starting
to take shape.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.250
- Killer's persistent
if not sophisticated.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.078
- Five bodies in 14 days?

09:17.121 --> 09:18.775
He's got an itch
that he can't scratch.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.777
- The behavioral analysis unit
thinks it's probably

09:20.821 --> 09:22.997
somebody who's struggling
with their own sexuality.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.477
Maybe somebody new in the area
who finds that kind of

09:25.521 --> 09:28.568
open community exciting but
triggering at the same time.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.613
- And the method of killing--
stabbing in the neck

09:30.657 --> 09:32.528
to watch them bleed out--that
is all about anger and rage.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.443
- Yeah, if he stays on pattern,

09:34.486 --> 09:35.836
he's going to
strike again soon.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.925
We need to find this guy fast.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.796
Kelly, where are we
on the shovel?

09:39.840 --> 09:42.364
- Uh, the only DNA recovered
was from Agent Scola

09:42.407 --> 09:44.148
and the homeless guy
who punched him.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.498
- Well, damn, suspect
must've been wearing gloves

09:46.542 --> 09:48.152
the entire time he handled it.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.198
- But the dirt samples
taken from it did match

09:50.241 --> 09:51.765
the New York
National Park soil.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.114
- Okay, so the shovel
is the killer's.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.594
Where are we on its purchase?

09:54.637 --> 09:55.899
- Lots of places
in New York sell it.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.205
We're putting together a list,

09:57.248 --> 09:58.641
trying to narrow down
time and date sold.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.512
- Grab the corresponding
security footage as well.

10:00.556 --> 10:03.733
- Okay, good, so the shovel
is a promising lead,

10:03.777 --> 10:05.517
but let's--let's not
rely on that alone

10:05.561 --> 10:07.998
to dig us out of this hole.
See what I did there?

10:08.042 --> 10:10.000
It's called a pun.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.134
- I might have something.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.005
Been scrubbing video footage
from last night

10:15.049 --> 10:17.007
around the Christopher Street
area like you asked.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.967
Building security cam footage
shows the latest victim,

10:20.010 --> 10:23.013
Rob Holden, leaving the club.
- Eyes up.

10:23.057 --> 10:26.016
- Now time stamp on that video
is 3:45 in the morning.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.757
- Okay, so to get
from this club

10:27.801 --> 10:28.976
to the New York
National Park,

10:29.019 --> 10:30.630
that takes an hour and 15 yeah?

10:30.673 --> 10:33.415
- So shortly after this footage
was shot, Rob was killed

10:33.458 --> 10:35.896
and driven upstate
in this blue van.

10:35.939 --> 10:39.073
Do we have a facial ID on
the bouncer he was talking to?

10:39.116 --> 10:41.118
- Yup. Guy's name
is Greg Robinson.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.599
- All right.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.037
- We don't have
any security cameras.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.256
I keep asking them
to put some in,

10:48.299 --> 10:49.823
but the boss thinks
it's intrusive.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.563
- Well, this man's name
is Rob Holden.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.435
He was killed last night

10:53.478 --> 10:55.698
shortly after
this video was taken.

10:55.742 --> 10:59.615
- Wow, for real?
- What did you two talk about?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.138
- I can't remember.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.444
It's like a circus
at closing time,

11:02.487 --> 11:03.837
like trying to herd cats
out the door.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.577
That is, if the cats
were all drunk dudes

11:05.621 --> 11:07.492
trying to hook up
with each other.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.320
- This was less than
24 hours ago.

11:09.364 --> 11:13.194
- I'm trying to remember
but...

11:13.237 --> 11:16.110
I think he was just, uh,
another party guy, you know?

11:16.153 --> 11:18.634
Bouncing around, dancing,
talking to 20 different dudes

11:18.678 --> 11:20.723
at once looking to get
a free vodka tonic.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.683
You know what I mean?
- What about a different guy?

11:23.726 --> 11:25.641
Medium build,
wearing a black hoodie,

11:25.685 --> 11:27.077
driving a blue van
at some point.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.252
You remember somebody
like that?

11:28.296 --> 11:31.168
- Um, I want to help,
I really do,

11:31.212 --> 11:33.083
but I don't be looking
at these dudes

11:33.127 --> 11:34.519
and the clothes
they be wearing.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.521
You know what I'm saying?
- Sure.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.001
- Not that it's a big deal
or anything.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.743
One life, one love right?

11:40.787 --> 11:43.659
- Okay, well, if you remember
anything, just give us a call.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.056
I'm gonna get Kelly to pull

11:49.099 --> 11:50.535
the club's credit card records
from last night.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.581
- Yeah, especially since
Holden would talk

11:52.624 --> 11:54.583
to anybody
who'd buy him a drink.

11:54.626 --> 11:57.064
Guy definitely wanted us
to know he was not gay.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.066
- Yeah, that mindset is still
prevalent in my community,

11:59.109 --> 12:01.329
especially with the men.
- Where you going?

12:02.199 --> 12:03.766
- Oh, to the outreach center
down the block.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.334
- For what?
- Well, my cousin works there.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.249
He's a pastor.
Might know something.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.077
- Worth a shot.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.907
- Yeah, I've seen a few
of these guys before.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.692
Never counseled any of them
one on one, though.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.086
Wish I had...maybe that
would've changed their outcome.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.957
- Come on,
let's not do this again, okay?

12:21.001 --> 12:22.350
These kids were targeted

12:22.393 --> 12:23.525
because of one man's
self-hatred

12:23.568 --> 12:24.831
and not because
they didn't have

12:24.874 --> 12:26.093
enough Jesus in their lives.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.965
- I know.
I just wish I could've helped.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.967
Find a way to get them out
of this lifestyle, you know.

12:31.011 --> 12:34.405
These guys are sellin' drugs,
turning tricks, you name it--

12:34.449 --> 12:35.537
just so they can get
their next meal.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.322
- Terrence,
like I've always told you

12:38.366 --> 12:40.585
you cannot save everybody.
Okay?

12:42.065 --> 12:43.937
- What about the people
you have counseled?

12:43.980 --> 12:46.374
Any whispers about anyone new

12:46.417 --> 12:47.854
or dangerous
in the neighborhood?

12:47.897 --> 12:50.117
- There's always someone
preying on these young men.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.597
Most of them are runaways,
out of work.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.382
Makes them ripe
for exploitation.

12:54.425 --> 12:57.211
- These murders are
pretty recent, so the person

12:57.254 --> 13:00.431
we're looking for probably
just showed up on the scene.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.172
Guessing he's aggressive.

13:02.216 --> 13:05.523
Probably hookin' up sexually
with these young men...

13:05.567 --> 13:07.351
before he kills them, that is.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.833
- There's a guy named Isaac.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.835
He extorts a lot
of the homeless

13:12.879 --> 13:16.491
making them pay for protection,
using violence if they refuse.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.580
As you can imagine,
they're broke so...

13:18.623 --> 13:20.103
- So they turn tricks.

13:20.147 --> 13:23.193
- You know if anyone's ever
reported him to the cops?

13:23.237 --> 13:25.152
- These men
don't trust the police.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.937
Plus, this Isaac dude's
pretty scary.

13:27.981 --> 13:30.897
I've seen him a few times.
He carries a knife on his belt.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.637
He isn't shy
about using it either.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.775
- All right, what else do
we know about Mr. Jones here?

13:39.819 --> 13:40.863
Aside from the fact
that he has a penchant

13:40.907 --> 13:42.822
for cheap neck tattoos.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.388
- Has a long history
of robbery and assault.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.868
Currently has an arrest warrant
in the system

13:45.912 --> 13:47.304
for the latest one.
- Good.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.697
Means you can drag
his ass in for questioning

13:48.740 --> 13:49.872
whether he likes it or not.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.265
Do we have
a last known address?

13:51.308 --> 13:53.049
- He's got a small house
in Brownsville.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.095
67th and Foster,
the rough part.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.661
- The really rough part.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.925
I made some arrests
in that area back in the day.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.231
- You never told me
you worked that beat.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.580
- You never asked.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.889
- Well, since Tiff
is apparently familiar

14:06.933 --> 14:09.631
with the area, you want us
to go pick Isaac up?

14:09.674 --> 14:11.024
- Uh, you guys have already
been

14:11.067 --> 14:12.808
on the wrong side
of a fight today.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.462
- Yeah, Maggie and OA
are still in the field.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.116
They can handle it.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.773
- Isaac Jones.
- Yeah.

14:21.817 --> 14:22.774
- FBI.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.606
- Is everything all right?

14:28.650 --> 14:30.130
- Just need to
have a word with you.

14:35.048 --> 14:41.968
<i>♪</i>

14:47.756 --> 14:49.236
- FBI, go, go.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.282
- You take left.
I'll take right.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.468
Are you good?
- Yeah, thanks.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.998
- What the hell are these?

15:56.042 --> 15:57.434
- You know exactly
what these are.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.871
Their pictures
of your victims.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.743
- You think I killed
these people?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.484
You out of your damn mind.

16:03.527 --> 16:06.008
- It doesn't matter
what we think, Isaac.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.575
It matters what we can prove.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.969
- I'm not guilty,
so how you gonna prove that?

16:10.012 --> 16:11.709
- Right now the knife
you tried to filet me with

16:11.753 --> 16:12.928
is in the crime lab.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.451
What are the odds
that it is a match

16:14.495 --> 16:16.149
to the murder weapon
used to kill these men?

16:16.192 --> 16:18.716
- Zero.
I don't kill people.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.936
I protect them.
- You mean you extort them.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.982
You shake them down
for money or else.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.071
Is this what happens to
the people who don't pay you?

16:25.114 --> 16:27.247
- Come on, I'm a businessman

16:27.290 --> 16:29.858
just like every other
security firm.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.860
I offer my services
for a fee.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.036
If somebody don't need it,
that's cool.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.125
I got enough clients as it is.

16:36.169 --> 16:39.259
Killers like this,
putting dudes in the dirt,

16:39.302 --> 16:41.957
it's good for business.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.177
Then the other day
there was this one guy,

16:44.220 --> 16:46.831
they call him Crabtree--
he almost got grabbed up.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.312
Got away and told all
his friends.

16:49.356 --> 16:54.100
Now they really trippin'.
Gonna have to pay me double.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.492
- What do you mean
he almost got grabbed up?

16:55.536 --> 16:59.148
By who?
- I don't know, some guy.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.498
Tried to throw him in the back
of the van and he got away.

17:01.542 --> 17:05.720
And like I said, business
has been good ever since.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.070
- Hey, guys.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.035
Lab just called.
Isaac's knife is not a match.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.689
- So he's got more than one.
- Yeah, likely.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.474
But, uh, we scrubbed some
building security footage

17:20.517 --> 17:21.823
across the street
from where he lives.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.955
Found time-stamped video
of him at his house

17:23.999 --> 17:26.523
when Holden was killed,
so he's not our killer.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.569
- Well, it might not
be a complete waste of time.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.266
Isaac might've just given us
a witness.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.181
He said some guy named Crabtree

17:32.225 --> 17:33.922
almost got abducted
the other day.

17:33.965 --> 17:37.099
- Really? Crab--Crabtree?
- Street name.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.057
- Right.

17:39.928 --> 17:44.106
- Yeah I--I know the name.
Sells dope, hustles older men.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.803
Picks some pockets too.

17:45.847 --> 17:46.978
Whatever it takes
to make a buck.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.764
- Don't suppose you know
his full name?

17:49.807 --> 17:52.201
- Um, no--not
off the top of my head,

17:52.245 --> 17:53.724
but I take
pretty detailed notes

17:53.768 --> 17:55.465
of all the people I counsel.
I can check my files.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.993
Uh, I tried putting
him into programs,

18:02.037 --> 18:04.039
but he just keeps
going back to the life.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.175
- Um, thanks so much
for helping out, cuz.

18:09.218 --> 18:12.134
We really appreciate it.
- Yeah, of course.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.270
- Take a lot of photos too.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.233
Wow, you weren't kidding
about these notes.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.540
This is impressive.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.194
- Please don't do that.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.848
These people deserve
their privacy.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.242
There's a lot of personal
information in here.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.288
- I apologize.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.644
- Crabtree's full name
is on the back.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.689
Please let him know I'm here
to help if he wants it.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.480
- All right, so
Phillip Johnson, aka Crabtree,

18:53.523 --> 18:55.090
how do we find this guy?
What do we know?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.353
- Uh, not much.
No permanent address.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.312
Hustler, runs at night.
- Which means he fits

18:59.355 --> 19:01.009
the profile
of the other victims.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.011
- He has six solicitation
arrests too.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.187
- But the last three were
in a four block radius

19:05.231 --> 19:06.971
of Christopher Street.
- Okay, yeah.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.495
Let's set up over there

19:08.538 --> 19:10.018
and see if we can't find
Mr. Crabtree.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.459
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.374
Hey, Crabtree, FBI.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.681
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.117
- What's going on?
I--I didn't do nothing.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.163
- You're not in trouble,
okay, like she said,

19:24.206 --> 19:25.903
we just have a few questions.
- Okay. About what?

19:27.470 --> 19:29.168
- Couple days ago, a guy
in a van tried to grab you.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.386
Is that true?

19:31.431 --> 19:33.433
- Yeah. What about it?
- What color was it?

19:33.476 --> 19:34.434
- Blue.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.090
- Can you tell us
what he looked like?

19:39.134 --> 19:41.092
- No. It was dark in the spot
where he pulled up.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.398
And he was wearing gloves

19:42.442 --> 19:44.095
and a hoodie pulled low
over his face.

19:45.227 --> 19:48.796
- Did he try to talk to you?
Like as a customer, a john?

19:48.839 --> 19:50.232
Is that how
he got close to you?

19:50.276 --> 19:51.755
- No, it wasn't anything
like that.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.453
To be honest, I thought
it was this preacher I know

19:53.496 --> 19:54.976
from the church.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.325
He drives a blue van
just like that.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.893
So I went over to say hey,
but this dude jumped out

19:58.936 --> 20:00.242
and tried to grab me.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.114
- Was he medium build?
Did you see a knife?

20:03.158 --> 20:05.508
- Look, I don't know.
- Well, come on.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.554
You gotta remember something
that can help us out.

20:07.597 --> 20:10.034
- Look, hand to God, I swear
I didn't--I didn't see no face.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.776
I don't know how big he was,
but he was Black for sure.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.126
I saw a little bit of his arm
when he tried to grab me.

20:22.482 --> 20:23.657
- Come on.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.316
- FBI, what's going on?

20:30.359 --> 20:33.014
- Busboy taking out the trash
called it in.

20:36.017 --> 20:42.937
<i>♪</i>

20:55.515 --> 20:57.299
- Listen up--bad news is
our killer has struck again,

20:57.343 --> 20:59.301
which means he is not
afraid of the cops.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.651
In fact, the thrill
of the kill seems to be

21:01.695 --> 21:04.393
accelerating his activity.
So let's revisit

21:04.437 --> 21:06.743
what we know so far--
he is Black, medium build,

21:06.787 --> 21:09.442
carries a knife,
and used to drive a blue van.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.183
- And we have his shovel.
- Yep, and we have his shovel,

21:12.227 --> 21:14.055
though we don't know who bought
it or from where.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.970
Not yet anyway.
Any update, Elise?

21:16.013 --> 21:17.624
- Not yet.
I've got over 100 people

21:17.667 --> 21:19.539
on video buying
that exact shovel

21:19.582 --> 21:20.888
from various stores
throughout New York.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.150
Knowing the suspect is Black
is helpful.

21:22.193 --> 21:23.456
I can narrow the search
even more.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.980
- Once you get facial rec hits
on the buyers,

21:26.023 --> 21:27.329
make sure you prioritize those

21:27.373 --> 21:29.331
with a violent criminal
history.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.945
- No, no, no that's right.
Look.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.209
- Hi.

21:39.341 --> 21:40.908
- What's up?

21:40.951 --> 21:42.953
- So I just finished scrubbing
some new security video

21:42.997 --> 21:44.999
from a street cam down
the block from Don John's.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.827
Captures the club's side entrance.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.089
- Did you get Holden
talking to anybody?

21:48.132 --> 21:50.483
- No, Holden was not
in any of the footage

21:50.526 --> 21:54.400
but Tiff's cousin,
Terrence, was.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.097
- The pastor?

21:56.140 --> 21:57.403
- He was at Don John's

21:57.446 --> 21:59.100
the night that Holden
was murdered,

21:59.143 --> 22:01.972
and it did not look like he was
on official church business.

22:02.016 --> 22:04.192
- Okay, that's weird
that a pastor would party,

22:04.235 --> 22:06.673
but it doesn't prove anything.
- No, but it's more than that.

22:06.716 --> 22:09.023
Think about it, okay?
Terrence is familiar

22:09.066 --> 22:11.373
with the type of victims this
type of killer is targeting.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.593
I saw his files.
Lots of long lens shots

22:13.636 --> 22:16.770
like he's stalking these guys.
And he drives a light blue van

22:16.813 --> 22:18.075
as part of the outreach.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.947
- We already got
the killer's van.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.079
- I know, but it's the same
type used by the church.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.647
Could be the reason
the victims got inside.

22:24.691 --> 22:27.258
If Terrence is the killer,
okay,

22:27.302 --> 22:29.391
and I'm not saying
that he is,

22:29.435 --> 22:31.959
stealing the same type of van
that he drives for the church,

22:32.002 --> 22:34.004
that's a clever move.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.224
- I mean it's possible but--

22:36.267 --> 22:39.575
- It could just be
a weird coincidence.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.882
Look bottom line
is that Terrence knew

22:41.925 --> 22:44.450
that Holden was at Don John's
the night that he was killed,

22:44.493 --> 22:47.453
but Terrence never mentioned
that he was there too.

22:47.496 --> 22:50.107
- That is weird.
Did you run it by Tiff?

22:50.151 --> 22:51.587
- No.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.377
I get it, okay? I know.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.335
I just wanted to bounce it off
you guys first

23:00.379 --> 23:03.251
to make sure
I'm even clear-eyed on this.

23:07.429 --> 23:10.824
- What do you think?
- It seems valid to me.

23:10.867 --> 23:15.002
<i>♪</i>

23:15.045 --> 23:16.612
- There's no way
Terrence is involved in this.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.309
I mean, I don't know why
he was at that club

23:18.353 --> 23:19.963
but--but I can talk to him
about that.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.748
- No. Not until we dig deeper.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.880
- Jubal's pulling
Terrence's phone's GPS

23:23.924 --> 23:27.014
to see if he was at the park
the night of Holden's murder.

23:27.057 --> 23:27.971
- This is crazy.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.019
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about this first?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.287
Look, I know my cousin.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.810
He--he's a pastor for a reason.

23:40.854 --> 23:43.030
He doesn't have a violent bone
in his body.

23:43.073 --> 23:46.163
- Hey I ju--just got the return
on Terrence's phone records.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.688
- And...
- His phone is shut off

23:48.731 --> 23:50.472
every night around 9 p.m.,

23:50.516 --> 23:53.301
so there's no way to track him
during the time of the murders.

23:53.344 --> 23:57.261
- So what?
That doesn't make him a killer.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.786
- No, but it creates questions
that we need answers to.

23:59.829 --> 24:02.484
- Okay, fine.
I'll get them for you.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.878
- No. Let's have Maggie and OA
bring him in for questioning.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.141
- Bring him in?
Is that really necessary?

24:07.184 --> 24:09.099
- If he has an alibi
we can confirm,

24:09.143 --> 24:10.666
it's gonna be
a short interview.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.582
If not. we're gonna take
a deeper dive into your cousin.

24:13.626 --> 24:16.716
Listen, I know
that neither of these scenarios

24:16.759 --> 24:18.413
are ideal for you.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.416
Which is exactly why
you need to recuse yourself.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.506
Stand down until we know more.
Am I clear?

24:26.073 --> 24:27.422
- Yes, ma'am.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.431
No heads up, for real?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.912
- Tiff, I just wanted to
make sure that--

24:42.959 --> 24:45.309
- We're trying to help you,
Terrence.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.442
But if you're telling us
that nobody can confirm

24:47.486 --> 24:49.531
your whereabouts at the times
of the murders--

24:49.575 --> 24:51.359
I mean, you're making our job
a lot harder.

24:51.402 --> 24:54.580
- This is crazy.

24:54.623 --> 24:58.453
I--I help people like this.
I don't kill them.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.846

25:04.241 --> 25:07.157
- Um, why do you turn it off
every night?

25:09.377 --> 25:12.075
- I--I work outreach.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.816
Most of the people
that I deal with

25:13.860 --> 25:18.647
are--are night owls, bipolar,
or--or drug addicts.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.606
They've lost their way.

25:20.649 --> 25:23.565
You--you have to set boundaries
with people like that.

25:23.609 --> 25:27.787
So for peace of mind,
and--and, you know,

25:27.830 --> 25:32.182
time to study the scripture,
I shut my phone off at night.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.445
- Well, two nights ago
there was a kid, Rob Holden,

25:34.489 --> 25:36.143
who was seen outside a club,
Don John's,

25:36.186 --> 25:38.449
shortly before being killed.

25:38.493 --> 25:41.322
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
Tiff told me.

25:41.365 --> 25:44.586
- Right.
- Did you talk to him there?

25:44.630 --> 25:47.546
- What?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.678
No!

25:49.722 --> 25:53.856
<i>I wasn't there at the club.
Why would I go there?</i>

25:53.900 --> 25:56.380
- Why lie to the FBI
about that?

25:56.424 --> 25:59.079
I mean, I know he's a preacher
and all, but it's 2021.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.864
Times have changed.
- Not for everyone.

26:04.475 --> 26:08.088
- So, um, for the record,
you're saying this isn't you?

26:16.009 --> 26:17.314
- No, that's--

26:18.925 --> 26:20.187
That's not me.

26:22.363 --> 26:26.759
I mean, sure, uh, same height,
same build but--

26:26.802 --> 26:29.588

not at that club.

other New Yorkers.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.606
Hey, do I need a lawyer?

Terrence wouldn't hurt a fly.

27:13.588 --> 27:16.330
- I know, but there's
some things he has to explain,

27:16.373 --> 27:17.418
and once he does,
he'll be free to leave.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.724
- What things?

27:18.767 --> 27:20.247
Why do they suspect
my son of these murders?

27:20.290 --> 27:22.336

on that, Unc. I'm sorry.

27:22.379 --> 27:23.685
- I am family, Tiff.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.034
What do you mean
you can't go into detail?

27:25.078 --> 27:27.123

investigation.

I--I want to tell you
everything, but I can't.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.692

we're talking about.

27:30.736 --> 27:33.434
You grew up together,
for Christ's sake.

27:33.477 --> 27:36.611
This is insane.

killing those kids.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.139
A gay man.

People gonna run their mouths,
think that Terrence is like--

27:46.447 --> 27:50.233
i-is like that.
That he's a freak.

27:51.757 --> 27:55.108
It'll ruin his reputation,
all because of you.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.634
And this damn job.

28:10.993 --> 28:13.082
- All right, so we haven't been
able to alibi out Terrence,

28:13.126 --> 28:15.737
but we're holding him
pending further investigation.

28:15.781 --> 28:16.869
We need to search
his apartment.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.435
Look for a hoodie,
the murder weapon,

28:18.479 --> 28:20.394
trophies from the victims,
anything that either

28:20.437 --> 28:22.352
implicates this guy
or proves his innocence.

28:22.396 --> 28:23.745

28:23.789 --> 28:25.442

- Okay, but we don't think
that she's--

28:29.185 --> 28:33.015
- No, I don't,
but if we were to gather

28:33.059 --> 28:36.366
some crucial piece of evidence
and she was present,

28:36.410 --> 28:37.933
the defense
would leverage that.

I'm a Baptist pastor.

You do the math.

there's absolutely nothing

30:54.853 --> 30:57.072
Some people in the community,

I care about what goes

31:17.832 --> 31:20.704
If it's documented,
the church will find out,

31:20.748 --> 31:23.577

Um, Elise, where are we at

at least 12 potential suspects

31:47.644 --> 31:48.732

31:48.776 --> 31:50.038
criminal histories

32:01.049 --> 32:02.833
- I know this guy.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.491
Okay, I can't go into detail

32:08.535 --> 32:10.145

The man buying a shovel
in this photo is Greg Robinson.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.981
He's a bouncer at Don John's
and he was seen

32:20.025 --> 32:21.635
talking to Holden
just before he was murdered.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.637
- All right, it's worth chasing
but it still doesn't

32:23.680 --> 32:25.378
alibi out your cousin--
at least not yet.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.249
- Terrence is gay.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.600
Or at least he suspects
that he might be.

32:30.644 --> 32:31.993
That's why he lied.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.516
He was afraid that the church
would find out

32:33.560 --> 32:35.736
and fire him
and he would lose everything.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.999
- I understand,
but suppressed sexuality

32:38.043 --> 32:40.175
fits perfectly
with our killer's profile.

32:40.219 --> 32:43.265
- Hey, we ran
Robinson's cell phone GPS.

32:43.309 --> 32:44.875
He was near
New York National Park

32:44.919 --> 32:46.268
the night of Holden's murder.

32:46.312 --> 32:48.444
- Near the park or at the park?

32:48.488 --> 32:50.229
- Near. Cell phone tower
coverage in that area

32:50.272 --> 32:52.927
is spotty and no way
to pinpoint the exact location.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.321
- So all we have against him
is circumstantial evidence.

32:55.364 --> 32:58.063
- He was seen buying the same
shovel that the killer used.

32:58.106 --> 32:59.934
He's good for this.
- OA's over at Don John's.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.370
Greg Robinson's not on shift,

33:01.414 --> 33:02.937
but his cell in pinging
in that area.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.852
- Because he's looking
for his next victim.

33:04.895 --> 33:07.898
- All right have OA stay there.
See if Robinson circles back.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.031
The rest of them can start
a grid search on foot.

33:10.075 --> 33:12.164
Wait not you.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.775
Listen I want him to be
the killer as much as you do,

33:14.818 --> 33:16.690
but until we know for sure
you need to step aside

33:16.733 --> 33:18.605
and let the others handle this.

33:33.968 --> 33:36.623
- Okay, phone's pinging
into this building.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.059
I think we should split up.
Cover more ground.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.104
I'm going to take
the east side.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.149
- All right, I'll go west.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.894
Entering the back
of the building now.

33:49.549 --> 33:51.333
- The street's clear.
I'm heading down the alley.

34:12.702 --> 34:15.314
- Oh, easy. Up you go.
-

34:15.357 --> 34:17.185
- Hey, hey, hey,
look at me, kid.

34:17.229 --> 34:20.101
You're gonna be okay.
I'm FBI, all right?

34:20.145 --> 34:21.755
We got a man down
in the west alley.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.496
I need an ambulance
to 8th and Hudson asap.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.193
- Scola, I'm on my way.

34:25.237 --> 34:26.803
- Hey, can you tell me
who did this to you?

34:26.847 --> 34:27.804
Which way he went?

34:27.848 --> 34:34.724
<i>♪</i>

34:57.660 --> 34:59.749
- Suspect down.
Roll a second ambulance.

35:02.056 --> 35:02.970
- I'll cover.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.366
- Hey, can you hear me?
-

35:07.409 --> 35:09.803
- Just stay with me, okay?

35:09.846 --> 35:12.719
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
stay with me.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.982
Come on.
-

35:24.339 --> 35:26.124
- He's dead.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.227
You went into the field

35:42.270 --> 35:44.272
after I specifically
ordered you not to.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.448
- I know and I'm sorry.

35:46.492 --> 35:49.973
Whatever punishment you decide
upon, I won't contest it.

35:53.629 --> 35:56.632
- Scola also told me how
you saved his life out there.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.374
Which is why I don't think
this needs to be

35:59.418 --> 36:01.376
anything more than
a verbal reprimand.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.989
- Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.382
- Have a seat.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.605
Unfortunately, when it comes
to your cousin,

36:12.648 --> 36:15.825
I cannot offer him
the same leniency.

36:16.957 --> 36:19.655
- What do you mean?
- The ADIC has weighed in.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.527
She says there has to be
consequences

36:21.570 --> 36:24.486
for people who lie
to the FBI.

36:38.413 --> 36:41.329
- I only held back
because I was afraid.

36:41.373 --> 36:43.679
I didn't want to--
- I know.

36:45.159 --> 36:46.073
I get it.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.905
But your lies prevented us
from doing our job.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.171
Terrence, if you had
told the truth...

36:57.215 --> 37:00.305
that last victim,
he'd be alive right now.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.438
Two people were killed tonight,
T, you get that, right?

37:05.962 --> 37:07.312
I just wish you had told me.

37:09.270 --> 37:12.055
I wish you would've been honest
from the beginning because...

37:12.099 --> 37:14.797
lying to an agent--
that's a felony.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.411
And now my hands are tied.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.505
I'm sorry.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.422
- Tiff--

37:30.465 --> 37:33.468
- Can you just, uh, please.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.300
- Tiff.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.833
- You got to stand up, T.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.057
Hands behind your back.

38:03.237 --> 38:06.284
You going to be all right, T.
All right?

38:09.199 --> 38:11.332
Okay?

38:11.376 --> 38:13.682
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.075
Just like always.

38:17.033 --> 38:17.947
All right?

38:52.199 --> 38:54.593
- I know that you're upset.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.602
But I was just trying
to protect you.

39:03.645 --> 39:06.431
- You know, if you would've
come to me first--

39:06.474 --> 39:08.433
if you would've told me
what you were thinking,

39:08.476 --> 39:10.304
I could've gone in there
and gotten answers

39:10.348 --> 39:13.220
before Terrence had a chance
to lie to Maggie and OA.

39:13.263 --> 39:16.310
- You were too close to it.
If Terrence had been the killer

39:16.354 --> 39:18.443
you could've said something
or done something.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.926
I just wanted to
keep you out of it, Tiff.

39:23.970 --> 39:26.102
'Til we knew for sure
what was going on.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.193
- You know,
if you really knew me...

39:31.673 --> 39:34.502
I mean, as a person...

39:35.808 --> 39:39.420
you'd know I'd never do
anything to compromise a case.

39:39.464 --> 39:42.423
Even if family was involved.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.991
And that's the real problem
with this partnership

39:45.034 --> 39:47.036
is that we don't talk.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.516
Like real talk.

39:50.213 --> 39:53.521
You can't expect me
to reveal things about my life

39:53.565 --> 39:56.872
when you stay so damn
buttoned up all the time

39:56.916 --> 40:00.180
just to project this idiotic
of quiet toughness.

40:05.533 --> 40:06.578
- You're right.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.325
Maybe it is time...

40:16.892 --> 40:19.025
to have some
real conversations.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.595
Not just small talk.

40:30.253 --> 40:32.342
- I'm down for that.
