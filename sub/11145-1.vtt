02:04.706 --> 02:07.237
<i>Meet George Jetson</i>

02:13.021 --> 02:15.208
<i>His boy, Elroy</i>

02:18.962 --> 02:21.502
<i>Daughter, Judy</i>

02:24.851 --> 02:27.442
<i>Jane, his wife</i>

03:40.618 --> 03:43.857
Oh, good morning, Tweeter.

03:48.777 --> 03:52.917
There's that cough again.
Polly want a gas mask?

03:53.855 --> 03:55.962
I'll bet it's the smog.

03:56.579 --> 03:58.666
Up we go.

04:10.504 --> 04:16.136
Well, now we've gotten rid of the smog,
let's get of the snoring.

04:34.354 --> 04:37.468
Up and at 'em, Mr. J.

04:40.982 --> 04:46.036
Oh, why did you have to wake me?
I was dreaming about sleeping.

05:23.088 --> 05:25.829
Mornin', Rosie. What's for breakfast?

05:25.933 --> 05:29.890
Orange juice, eggs, bacon,
toast with marmalade and coffee.

05:29.994 --> 05:33.309
- How do you want your eggs?
- Skip the eggs.

05:33.413 --> 05:37.319
Watching your cholesterol,
eh, Mr. J? Say, "Ahh."

05:37.632 --> 05:39.529
Ahh.

05:41.865 --> 05:45.261
Mm. You burned the toast.

05:45.698 --> 05:48.856
- Have a good day, Dad.
- You too, Elroy.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.129
- Uh, Dad?
- Yeah, son?

05:51.233 --> 05:53.884
You're coming to my spaceball game
today, aren't you?

05:53.988 --> 05:56.432
It's the tournament semi-finals.

05:56.536 --> 06:01.067
Sure, Elroy.
I wouldn't miss it for the universe.

06:02.311 --> 06:05.143
- Starts at 4.00.
- I'll be there.

06:05.247 --> 06:08.252
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you, Judy.

06:08.357 --> 06:12.905
Uh, Dad? Uh, there's a dance
at school this afternoon.

06:13.009 --> 06:17.211
- That's nice, dear.
- Oh, thanks, Dad. You're outergalactic.

06:17.316 --> 06:20.452
- Yeah, I'm out of money too.
- Bye, darling.

06:23.987 --> 06:25.934
Astro!

06:28.405 --> 06:31.301
So I forgot to say goodbye.

06:33.172 --> 06:35.804
I love you, George.

06:35.908 --> 06:39.753
I know, I know. I love you too.

06:58.810 --> 07:01.601
Oh, no, not again.

07:04.915 --> 07:09.404
<i>This is Rocket Rick,
your Dees drive-time digital top-ten DJ.</i>

07:09.508 --> 07:13.074
<i>And here's the morning traffic advisory
for all of you poor drones</i>

07:13.179 --> 07:15.432
<i>who have to do this every day.</i>

07:15.536 --> 07:18.337
Turn around, go home and go back to bed.

07:18.441 --> 07:22.555
Very funny. Now let's have it straight
or I'm gonna be late again.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.616
<i>Okay, here it is straight, just for you.</i>

07:25.720 --> 07:30.574
<i>The skyway's backed up from the 101
to the 202 and the 303.</i>

07:30.678 --> 07:33.036
<i>Get off and head for the 404.</i>

07:33.349 --> 07:35.845
404, right.

07:40.386 --> 07:43.517
<i>Oh, too late. The 404 is jammed.</i>

07:43.622 --> 07:47.640
I know. I know.
It's time for the Jetson traffic-beater.

07:47.744 --> 07:50.345
Inflate-a-Cop.

07:52.065 --> 07:56.288
I hate to be this sneaky,
but my job's on the line.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.817
My siren's getting better every day.

08:24.763 --> 08:27.138
Rooh-oh.

08:34.373 --> 08:38.792
<i>Too bad, George.
Traffic school begins next Saturday.</i>

08:38.897 --> 08:41.604
<i>In the meantime, here's one just for you.</i>

09:25.439 --> 09:30.884
George Jetson reporting, to say
whatever it is I do, I just did it again.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.790
<i>You certainly did, George.</i>

09:33.894 --> 09:37.834
What's our old penny-pinching,
pea-headed president up to today?

09:37.938 --> 09:43.357
<i>Mr. Spacely is meeting with the board
of directors for the entire day.</i>

09:43.461 --> 09:49.837
Thank you. This is George Jetson
signing off for the entire day.

09:50.255 --> 09:53.543
And so I guarantee to reverse the...

09:53.647 --> 09:57.500
...slight downside
of our profit picture...

09:58.440 --> 10:02.009
...with the newest development
of Spacely sprockets and spindles.

10:02.113 --> 10:04.250
It had better be good, Spacely.

10:04.354 --> 10:08.973
It's better than good. It's cheap.

10:09.807 --> 10:13.253
And that means... higher profits.

10:13.357 --> 10:18.219
More money for you and, of course, for me.

10:18.532 --> 10:22.629
Gentlemen and woman,
I present to you a holographic model

10:22.733 --> 10:24.734
of our most top-secret project,

10:24.838 --> 10:28.821
the Spacely Sprocket and Spindle
Orbiting Ore Asteroid

10:28.925 --> 10:32.214
Manufacturing Plant Unlimited.

10:32.527 --> 10:35.502
This plant will produce
Spacely sprockets and spindles

10:35.606 --> 10:38.128
at one-tenth of what it costs down here.

10:38.233 --> 10:41.303
- Yeah, when it's working.
- I, uh, beg your pardon?

10:41.408 --> 10:44.269
According to my reports,
this space station

10:44.373 --> 10:48.339
has worked a grand total
of three days in the last six months.

10:48.443 --> 10:50.131
- What? Three days?
- This is an outrage!

10:50.235 --> 10:55.229
- What's going on here?
- That's because we've had leadership problems.

10:55.333 --> 11:00.342
- Yeah, my feeling exactly.
- I mean leadership on the asteroid.

11:00.447 --> 11:03.871
But everything is going smoothly now
with new Vice President

11:03.975 --> 11:07.031
Alexander Throttlebottom in charge.

11:07.136 --> 11:12.224
Soon, we will produce our one millionth
Spacely sprocket in outer space.

11:12.537 --> 11:16.573
Spacely! Spacely! Spacely! Spacely!

11:16.677 --> 11:19.061
Ooh, it's so nice to be loved.

11:19.374 --> 11:22.575
Mr. Spacely, you have a call.

11:22.679 --> 11:25.184
I hate it when you interrupt my ovations.

11:25.288 --> 11:28.577
It's important. We've lost another one.

11:28.681 --> 11:29.837
What?

11:33.682 --> 11:35.686
Rudy 2, how could this happen?

11:35.790 --> 11:40.641
<i>He ran away, sir, same as the other three.
I think he got scared and just left.</i>

11:40.745 --> 11:44.563
That weasel, Throttlebottom,
I knew I couldn't rely on him.

11:44.719 --> 11:46.998
At least the plant's still running, right?

11:47.207 --> 11:50.217
<i>Wrong, it's been sabotaged again.</i>

11:53.018 --> 11:57.410
<i>And I can't tell who or what's behind it.</i>

11:57.514 --> 12:01.672
Well, fix it! I can't make profits
if you're not making sprockets.

12:01.777 --> 12:04.237
<i>Fine, but I'm not pushing that button.</i>

12:04.342 --> 12:09.560
But the Orbiting Ore Asteroid can't work
without someone to push the button.

12:09.665 --> 12:12.675
I'll make you a vice president, Rudy 2.

12:12.779 --> 12:16.824
<i>Forget it. We've lost four
vice presidents. It's not worth it.</i>

12:17.085 --> 12:21.155
I'll give you a Ra... raise.

12:21.260 --> 12:23.399
<i>No button.</i>

12:24.895 --> 12:29.766
What'll I do? What'll I do?
I can lick this problem. But how?

12:29.870 --> 12:34.135
Think, Spacely, think. First, I need
a replacement for that Throttlebottom.

12:34.239 --> 12:36.577
But who?

12:36.681 --> 12:40.022
- Gertrude!
- Yes, Mr. Spacely?

12:40.126 --> 12:42.361
Take a problem.

12:43.727 --> 12:45.727
Need, one...

12:45.831 --> 12:49.513
...a worker whose total loyalty
is to Spacely Sprockets.

12:49.763 --> 12:55.817
And, of course, to me, president,
CEO and all-around sweetie pie.

12:55.921 --> 12:58.896
Two, someone expendable.

12:59.626 --> 13:01.889
Very funny. Three,

13:01.993 --> 13:04.524
someone who will work for peanuts.

13:04.628 --> 13:09.699
Four, not too bright. And five,
someone who can push a button.

13:09.803 --> 13:12.473
That's it. Okay, okay, what have you got?

13:12.578 --> 13:16.451
It's thinking, Mr. Spacely. It's thinking.

13:17.883 --> 13:19.658
Jetson?

13:19.762 --> 13:23.468
I wouldn't use Jetson if Spacely Sprockets
were going bankrupt!

13:23.572 --> 13:27.260
If I needed a transfusion!
If I lost my stockholders!

13:27.364 --> 13:29.999
My home! If I were penniless!

13:30.312 --> 13:34.279
- Penniless?
- He is expendable.

13:34.383 --> 13:35.549
Perfect.

13:36.393 --> 13:38.915
<i>Jetson!</i>

13:39.020 --> 13:41.768
<i>You. Here. Now.</i>

13:50.327 --> 13:53.893
Welcome aboard, Vice President Jetson.

13:54.206 --> 13:56.093
Vice president?

13:56.197 --> 14:00.468
Right, vice president in charge
of the Orbiting Ore Asteroid.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.122
Congratulations!

14:03.226 --> 14:05.336
Me, vice president?

14:05.440 --> 14:09.132
Don't slobber, George.
You and your family leave tomorrow.

14:09.289 --> 14:13.750
- Go home. Pack.
- Vice president? Pack? Go?

14:13.855 --> 14:17.004
Ah, how quickly you grasp things.

14:17.108 --> 14:19.961
I knew you were the right man
for the job up there.

14:20.065 --> 14:24.014
- Up there?
- George? What do you do for us down here?

14:24.118 --> 14:26.910
Well, I push the button
that gets things started.

14:27.015 --> 14:32.799
Exactly, and now, with your family
beside you, you face a new challenge.

14:32.903 --> 14:36.104
- Are you up to it, Jetson?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Spacely.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.670
- It's going to be lot of work.
- Not too much for me, sir.

14:39.774 --> 14:43.741
Good, then roll up your sleeves.
You'll be working overtime.

14:52.125 --> 14:56.231
Gosh, the game's almost over.
I wonder what's keeping Dad.

14:57.501 --> 14:59.379
Elroy!

15:00.458 --> 15:02.059
Go, Elroy!

15:02.320 --> 15:04.764
- Now, coach?
- Now, Elroy.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.600
The last shot of the game
to win it for us.

15:07.704 --> 15:09.339
You got the tall guy on you.

15:09.443 --> 15:14.053
- Shall I give him the Elroy Elevator?
- What else? It's the only shot you got.

15:14.158 --> 15:17.532
Get out there and sink it, or I'm sunk.

15:18.593 --> 15:21.576
Here it comes, the Elroy Elevator.

15:21.681 --> 15:25.509
Going up, going down.
Going up, going down.

15:25.613 --> 15:27.970
Going in.

15:28.778 --> 15:32.413
- All right!
- Great shot, Elroy!

15:32.997 --> 15:35.615
Hey, where's Dad?

15:36.460 --> 15:40.878
My big moment,
and he wasn't here to see it.

15:42.695 --> 15:45.749
<i>Will you still be there?</i>

15:45.853 --> 15:52.081
<i>It's so hard to reason
with a heart out of control</i>

15:52.185 --> 15:58.474
<i>Why wait to hear an answer
when it's too soon to know</i>

15:58.578 --> 16:01.296
<i>Maybe love</i>

16:01.401 --> 16:04.482
<i>Maybe not</i>

16:04.692 --> 16:08.581
<i>No, the chance is all we're given</i>

16:08.685 --> 16:11.416
<i>The chance is all we've got</i>

16:11.520 --> 16:14.435
<i>Maybe love</i>

16:14.539 --> 16:17.748
<i>Maybe not</i>

16:18.166 --> 16:24.768
<i>Still something in me
says this may be love</i>

16:25.263 --> 16:31.621
<i>All I know for certain
is I've never felt like this</i>

16:31.726 --> 16:34.837
<i>A love that lasts forever</i>

16:34.941 --> 16:38.876
<i>Could start with just a kiss</i>

16:38.980 --> 16:41.484
Hey, what's your name?

16:41.589 --> 16:44.181
Uh, Judy.

16:44.494 --> 16:49.295
Well, Ju-Ju-Judy,
we got a date Friday night.

16:50.818 --> 16:53.808
<i>Maybe love</i>

16:53.913 --> 16:57.209
<i>Maybe not</i>

16:57.313 --> 17:01.143
- You've got a real date with Cosmic Cosmo!
- <i>No, the chance is all we're given</i>

17:01.247 --> 17:03.876
- <i>The chance is all we've got</i>
- How nebular!

17:03.980 --> 17:06.961
<i>Maybe love</i>

17:09.770 --> 17:14.839
And you can be sure your donation will help
the recycling program, Mrs. Skypad.

17:14.944 --> 17:17.119
Thank you.

17:18.903 --> 17:22.713
What's the matter, Elroy?
Did your team lose the big game?

17:22.817 --> 17:24.931
No, I made the winning shot.

17:25.035 --> 17:28.236
- Why so upset, then?
- Dad never showed up.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.498
Why, that's not like him.

17:30.602 --> 17:35.647
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
I've got a date with Cosmic Cosmo.

17:35.751 --> 17:38.848
- Tomorrow!
- Ah, young love.

17:39.161 --> 17:43.354
I remember one time my date and I
tripped the light fantastic,

17:43.458 --> 17:46.381
and we tripped a few circuit breakers too.

17:46.485 --> 17:50.025
Hello, I'm home, and I've got great news!

17:50.129 --> 17:54.322
- They made me a vice president.
- Way to go, George!

17:54.530 --> 17:57.505
- All right!
- We gotta move.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.896
Move?

17:59.001 --> 18:02.636
Yep, to Spacely's Orbiting Ore Asteroid.

18:02.741 --> 18:05.986
To Spacely's Orbiting Ore Asteroid?

18:06.090 --> 18:08.943
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

18:09.047 --> 18:11.639
But what about my spaceball playoffs?

18:11.743 --> 18:14.448
And my date with Cosmic Cosmo.

18:14.553 --> 18:18.553
- And my recycling.
- Hey, I thought you'd be happy.

18:18.658 --> 18:21.520
You all know how long
I've wanted to get a promotion.

18:21.624 --> 18:25.973
And besides, I'm doing it
all for you, my family.

18:26.078 --> 18:28.765
Ah, George.

18:30.983 --> 18:34.254
Your father's right, kids.
I'm sorry, honey.

18:34.358 --> 18:38.342
- I'm really thrilled for you.
- Metacataclysmic.

18:38.863 --> 18:42.387
- Her life is over.
- My life is over!

18:42.491 --> 18:45.587
She just needs to get used to the idea.

18:45.691 --> 18:50.302
She's not the only one.
Oh, well, maybe it won't be so bad.

18:50.406 --> 18:54.207
How long can Mr. J last
as a vice president anyways?

18:54.624 --> 18:57.268
I'll start packing.

19:00.980 --> 19:05.234
Don't be so glum, Elroy.
With my new job, I can set my own hours.

19:05.338 --> 19:07.634
We'll have lost of extra time together.

19:07.739 --> 19:10.809
Then you can help me
perfect my Elroy Elevator shot?

19:10.914 --> 19:13.410
Son, we'll make you a spaceball star.

20:04.171 --> 20:05.894
There it is.

20:11.355 --> 20:15.639
- It won't be long now.
- Yeah, I can hardly wait.

20:18.261 --> 20:20.514
Look, Judy, it's got a shopping mall.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.411
A mall?

20:22.515 --> 20:25.950
Oh, nothing matters without Cosmo.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.059
It doesn't look so bad at all.

20:36.692 --> 20:39.859
I hope they have
a Quickie Lube Robot Repair.

20:39.963 --> 20:43.585
My arm squeaks from all that packin'.

20:45.547 --> 20:49.331
Look, there's the Orbiting Ore Asteroid.

20:59.159 --> 21:04.873
- And there's the new plant.
- Your new plant, Mr. Vice President.

21:06.020 --> 21:07.601
Well...

21:15.547 --> 21:20.992
Hey, take a look. Our new hometown.
Intergalactic Garden Estates.

21:21.096 --> 21:25.523
It doesn't look like any place
I've ever seen before.

21:29.863 --> 21:32.315
What's this, the garage?

21:32.420 --> 21:34.534
It's very nice, George.

21:34.639 --> 21:36.795
Oh, brother!

21:36.899 --> 21:40.014
Oh, I guess I can do something with it.

21:40.118 --> 21:42.275
You're gonna have to. It's empty.

21:42.380 --> 21:48.103
Well, uh, maybe the furniture and stuff
is just late being delivered, maybe.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.625
- Where's my room?
- Where's the kitchen?

21:50.730 --> 21:54.905
Where's the phone? I've gotta call Francie
and find out what I'm missing.

21:55.165 --> 21:58.557
I wonder if this thing works up here.

22:00.688 --> 22:04.742
Say! Oh, how nice.

22:25.504 --> 22:28.313
Oh, wow! This is orbital!

22:30.697 --> 22:33.306
Come on, boy!
Let's give this thing a whirl.

22:33.410 --> 22:35.724
- All right!
- What'll it be, Astro?

22:35.828 --> 22:39.594
- Slow, medium of fast?
- Slow!

22:41.265 --> 22:45.805
Jane! Get me off this crazy thing!

22:56.251 --> 22:59.753
Oh, boy! This is better than home!

23:06.993 --> 23:10.498
Say, isn't this nice. "Welcome Jetsons."

23:12.533 --> 23:15.082
Hey! Whoa! Hold it!

23:16.587 --> 23:18.465
Now, who could that be?

23:18.570 --> 23:22.676
Welcome wagon!
I'm your upstairs neighbour, Lucy 2!

23:22.780 --> 23:27.870
Oh, thank you, Lucy.
How nice. I'm Jane Jetson.

23:27.974 --> 23:32.304
George... come meet one of our
new neighbours. That's my husband.

23:32.617 --> 23:38.479
- What breed is he?
- No, not Astro. Him, George.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.133
Him George!

23:41.237 --> 23:45.452
Now cut that out! Hi, glad to...

23:46.282 --> 23:49.874
See you guys! Gotta check this place out!

23:49.978 --> 23:53.543
I just found out Doris told Susie,
and Susie told Mary,

23:53.647 --> 23:57.131
and Mary and Francie, and Francie told me,

23:57.235 --> 24:00.051
Helen took my date with Cosmo!

24:00.155 --> 24:03.252
And now my heart is totally broken!

24:03.982 --> 24:07.722
I'll never be happy again.
Never, never, never, never.

24:07.826 --> 24:10.768
I hate this place!

24:13.367 --> 24:17.941
- Don't worry. Kids are all the same.
- You have kids?

24:18.046 --> 24:21.839
Oh, yes! In fact, your son
might run into my son, Teddy 2.

24:21.943 --> 24:23.404
Where's your husband?

24:23.509 --> 24:26.970
You'll meet Ruby 2 at the plant.
He works there.

24:27.075 --> 24:30.119
He does? Oh, great!
I'll see him in the morning.

24:30.224 --> 24:33.320
- That's the big startup day.
- Again.

24:33.425 --> 24:37.695
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing. Well, enjoy the goodies.

24:37.799 --> 24:40.757
If you'd like me to show you
around the mall tomorrow, Jane...

24:40.861 --> 24:45.559
That sounds like fun. Judy, how'd you like
to go shopping at the mall tomorrow?

24:45.663 --> 24:50.402
I can't. I can't. What time does it open?

24:51.411 --> 24:56.441
- Shall I serve dinner?
- Elroy's not back yet. I'm getting worried.

24:57.483 --> 25:01.502
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- Elroy, you should know better than...

25:01.606 --> 25:03.415
Yikes!

25:03.519 --> 25:08.895
Hold it! How many times
have I told you not to bring in pets?

25:08.999 --> 25:12.983
I know, Dad, but he followed me home.
Can I keep him, please?

25:14.870 --> 25:16.897
Hmm.

25:23.481 --> 25:25.421
Huh?

25:26.047 --> 25:30.334
- Can I keep him, Dad? Can I?
- No, of course not!

25:30.438 --> 25:34.597
- He's awfully cute.
- Well, now, suppose he belongs to somebody.

25:34.702 --> 25:38.250
- Like who?
- Like us. Sorry, but the door was open.

25:38.354 --> 25:42.572
And we've been looking for the little one.
Fergie Furbelow!

25:42.676 --> 25:45.209
You know better
than to wander off like that.

25:45.313 --> 25:48.672
What have you got to say for yourself?

25:48.776 --> 25:50.713
Mama.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.088
We're the Furbelows. Bertie Furbelow.

25:54.192 --> 25:55.876
- Gertie Furbelow.
- How do you do?

25:55.980 --> 25:58.604
And that's our little Fergie.
She's a girl.

25:58.708 --> 26:01.561
- How can you tell?
- Uh, we're...

26:01.665 --> 26:05.062
The Jetsons. George, Jane,
Judy and Elroy. We know.

26:05.166 --> 26:09.181
Been expectin' you. We're all the way
from the outer rings of Krile.

26:09.285 --> 26:11.563
Now we're your next door neighbours.

26:11.668 --> 26:15.130
Oh! Well, we're pleased to meet you.

26:15.234 --> 26:18.305
Come on, all. Let's give 'em
some peace their first day.

26:18.409 --> 26:21.426
Hey, look, if you need anything,
remember we're right through the wall.

26:21.531 --> 26:23.950
Hope you like Furbelow music, George.

26:24.106 --> 26:27.655
Got super surround sound
sonic boomers in our place.

26:27.759 --> 26:30.177
Uh, what is Furbelow music?

26:30.281 --> 26:33.528
Mostly drums and chants, you know.

26:35.718 --> 26:37.431
Oh, you'll love it.

26:37.535 --> 26:42.085
So welcome, all you Jetsons,
to Intergalactic Garden Estates.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.647
Weird, huh?

27:02.751 --> 27:05.847
I wonder what they're saying about us.

27:06.596 --> 27:09.587
You know, George,
I've got the strangest feeling

27:09.691 --> 27:13.014
something wonderful's
going to happen to us up here.

27:13.119 --> 27:15.893
That's funny. I feel the same way.

27:15.998 --> 27:18.311
Good night, George.

27:18.416 --> 27:20.783
Good night, dear.

28:27.573 --> 28:30.106
Wake up, George.

28:31.670 --> 28:36.261
Come on, Mr. Vice President, darling.
Up and at 'em.

28:38.228 --> 28:41.368
Stand back, Mrs J.
Let's see what this does.

28:52.754 --> 28:56.088
Ow! Hey, what the...

28:56.193 --> 28:58.422
Hey!

29:04.348 --> 29:08.880
<i>Good morning, Mr. Jetson. Sit back, relax.
I'm Mac, your transportation.</i>

29:08.985 --> 29:12.483
<i>We're on your own personal skyway,
taking you right to the plant.</i>

29:12.837 --> 29:16.624
Huh? You mean no traffic? No gridlock?

29:16.728 --> 29:19.500
- No skyway patrol?
- <i>That's right, bub.</i>

29:19.605 --> 29:25.415
My dream come true. Wait a minute.
I can't go to the office in my pajamas.

29:25.519 --> 29:30.085
<i>Hey, no problem. We groom you on the way.</i>

29:30.189 --> 29:33.643
Hey! Easy! Whoa! Watch it!

29:34.955 --> 29:36.894
Not bad.

29:39.114 --> 29:41.441
<i>Goodbye, darling.</i>

29:42.045 --> 29:45.054
- <i>Have a nice day, Dad.</i>
- Thanks, son.

29:45.158 --> 29:49.317
- <i>Bye, Dad.</i>
- Enjoy the mall, dear. Feel better.

29:49.942 --> 29:52.578
<i>I love you, George!</i>

29:53.422 --> 29:55.345
Yech.

29:56.649 --> 30:01.519
Ah, this is the life. To the office, Mac!

30:10.539 --> 30:12.862
Hi! You must be Rudy 2.

30:12.966 --> 30:16.734
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Jetson.
- Call me George.

30:16.838 --> 30:18.976
Wow, what a place.

30:19.081 --> 30:22.760
Well, I guess we should
have a staff meeting.

30:22.865 --> 30:27.327
- I'd like to meet all the employees.
- You just did.

30:27.431 --> 30:31.067
You mean, you and me? That's it?

30:31.171 --> 30:35.633
That's why it's so cheap to make sprockets
here. We're fully automated.

30:35.737 --> 30:40.243
But it's still all in your hands, George.
Or should I say, your finger.

30:40.660 --> 30:43.191
There's the drilling bore.
It brings up the ore.

30:43.296 --> 30:45.736
The bore brings up the ore. Got it.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.767
- The ore makes the sprockets.
- The ore makes the sprockets?

30:48.871 --> 30:50.705
Uh-huh.

30:50.872 --> 30:53.754
- Pack the sprockets into packets
- Sack the packets into brackets?

30:53.858 --> 30:55.943
- For the lockers
- For the lockers

30:56.047 --> 30:58.595
Lock the sprocket locker key
in the pocket of your jacket

30:58.700 --> 31:01.248
Got the sprocket locker key
in my outer jacket pocket

31:01.352 --> 31:03.771
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready!

31:03.876 --> 31:06.362
Take the bored ore packets
from the packet brackets

31:06.467 --> 31:09.056
- And we rocket
- While we're rappin'

31:09.160 --> 31:11.632
Yes, we rocket while we're rappin'
and we're rockin' and a rollin'

31:11.737 --> 31:14.077
And we rocket the sprockets to Spacely

31:14.182 --> 31:15.670
Yeah!

31:15.878 --> 31:17.792
Hey, you've done everything.

31:17.896 --> 31:20.706
Everything but press the button
that gets it all going.

31:20.810 --> 31:24.490
That's your job, George.
And Mr. Spacely says you're the best!

31:24.594 --> 31:29.038
Well, I wouldn't say that.
But well, yes, maybe I would.

31:29.142 --> 31:31.474
I just have to make a few adjustments,

31:31.578 --> 31:34.471
then we'll notify Mr. Spacely
we're ready to start.

31:34.575 --> 31:38.867
Ah, I love my job.
Tell me when you're ready, Rudy.

31:38.971 --> 31:42.068
Yes, Mr. Vice President.

31:43.503 --> 31:46.344
Call me for lunch.

31:49.539 --> 31:54.028
Hmm. This is our fifth opening day
at the new plant.

31:54.132 --> 31:57.290
Jetson better not mess this thing up.

32:01.725 --> 32:04.491
George's button-pushing
ceremony begins at noon.

32:04.596 --> 32:06.569
And we don't have too much time,

32:06.674 --> 32:09.388
so we'll just make this
a quick little look-around.

32:09.492 --> 32:12.876
And here we are, the Galaxy Galleria.

32:22.722 --> 32:25.923
<i>Credit chips to the right, ladies.</i>

32:32.116 --> 32:35.595
I hope George's credit is good up here.

32:39.292 --> 32:41.666
It's lunaristic!

32:43.084 --> 32:46.426
Except that Cosmic Cosmo isn't here.

32:46.676 --> 32:48.812
Mom, um...

32:48.916 --> 32:53.232
I'd sort of like to wander around
by myself, if you guys don't mind.

32:53.336 --> 32:57.453
Sure, go ahead. Just back in time
for us to get to Dad's ceremony.

32:57.557 --> 33:00.784
No problem. Thanks.

33:01.724 --> 33:04.967
Maybe I'll go up to the nature zone.

33:15.823 --> 33:17.676
<i>No</i>

33:17.780 --> 33:23.242
<i>I'm not making that promise again</i>

33:23.346 --> 33:27.930
<i>Nothing can change my mind</i>

33:29.218 --> 33:32.828
<i>Nothing at all</i>

33:32.932 --> 33:35.524
<i>'Cause love</i>

33:35.628 --> 33:40.639
<i>Has a way of coming undone</i>

33:40.743 --> 33:46.683
<i>Till I'm all alone with my heart</i>

33:46.787 --> 33:50.746
<i>And here I'll stay</i>

33:50.850 --> 33:56.416
<i>And I always thought I'd see you again</i>

33:57.121 --> 33:59.931
<i>Oh, how it hurts every time</i>

34:00.035 --> 34:03.339
<i>You've crossed my heart since then</i>

34:03.444 --> 34:08.558
<i>God, I'd give it all it takes
to hold what might have been</i>

34:08.661 --> 34:13.899
<i>'Cause I always thought I'd see you again</i>

34:15.143 --> 34:20.779
<i>Love doesn't come when you need love</i>

34:20.882 --> 34:26.929
<i>It's not always there when you fall</i>

34:27.033 --> 34:33.504
<i>Try as you may, you've got nothing to say</i>

34:34.530 --> 34:37.754
<i>Nothing at all</i>

34:47.560 --> 34:52.681
<i>I always thought I'd see you again</i>

34:53.630 --> 34:56.310
<i>Oh, how it hurts every time</i>

34:56.414 --> 34:59.659
<i>You've crossed my heart again</i>

34:59.764 --> 35:04.886
<i>God, I'd give it all it takes
to hold what might have been</i>

35:04.991 --> 35:11.061
<i>'Cause I always thought I'd see you again</i>

35:13.854 --> 35:18.263
<i>'Cause I always thought I'd see you</i>

35:20.204 --> 35:22.879
<i>Again</i>

35:26.501 --> 35:32.789
Ooh, that Cosmic Cosmo!
I'll never trust another boy ever again.

35:38.904 --> 35:42.758
Ooh, you dumb, dumb, duh...

35:42.862 --> 35:44.715
- Dummy?
- Uh-huh.

35:44.819 --> 35:47.602
Uh-huh, right.

35:47.706 --> 35:50.280
It was all my fault.

35:50.665 --> 35:53.622
My name's Apollo Blue.

35:56.152 --> 35:57.969
I'm Judy.

35:58.073 --> 36:01.892
Oh, my gosh! It's two minutes
to 12.00! I've gotta go!

36:01.997 --> 36:05.172
Don't tell me you turn into a pumpkin.

36:05.782 --> 36:07.547
Hey!

36:07.651 --> 36:10.617
See you tomorrow, pumpkin?
Same time, same place?

36:10.721 --> 36:15.505
Yeah! Cosmagoric City!

36:23.385 --> 36:25.856
Elroy Jetson?

36:25.960 --> 36:28.160
Here, coach.

36:28.265 --> 36:31.127
You pair off with Teddy 2
for a little one-on-one.

36:31.231 --> 36:34.207
- I wanna see your best shot.
- Sure, coach.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.946
Hi. You any good?

36:38.259 --> 36:41.686
My name may be Teddy 2,
but I'm number one.

36:41.791 --> 36:46.722
You mean you were. Back home they
used to call this the Elroy Elevator.

36:48.531 --> 36:50.644
Going up.

36:54.211 --> 36:58.559
Going down. Going in!

36:59.412 --> 37:02.552
No way, Elroy.

37:08.232 --> 37:10.041
That's two for Teddy 2.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.955
I think your elevator is out of order.

37:13.059 --> 37:17.234
- Comin' to the ceremony?
- You bet.

37:18.565 --> 37:21.219
It's D-Day, gentlemen and woman.

37:21.323 --> 37:25.915
Or as I prefer to call it, P-Day!
P for profits!

37:26.019 --> 37:28.916
Today, the one millionth Spacely Sprocket.

37:29.020 --> 37:32.081
Tomorrow, the universe!

37:34.587 --> 37:38.196
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce our new vice president

37:38.300 --> 37:41.815
up at the Orbiting Ore Asteroid...

37:42.641 --> 37:45.189
George Jetson.

37:45.544 --> 37:48.034
- That's my George!
- Way to go, Dad!

37:48.138 --> 37:51.948
Elroy, I know you're father
hasn't had much time for you lately,

37:52.052 --> 37:54.497
but couldn't you show him
a little support?

37:54.601 --> 37:56.566
Okay.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.227
Jetson!

38:00.072 --> 38:04.490
<i>Oh, there you are, Mr. Spacely.
And... hi to you, board.</i>

38:04.594 --> 38:06.047
- Hello, George!
- Hi!

38:06.151 --> 38:09.049
<i>Before this finger presses
the button to start the plant,</i>

38:09.153 --> 38:12.284
<i>I'd like to say a few words
of thanks to Mr. Spacely</i>

38:12.388 --> 38:15.536
<i>for making this day possible
for my family and...</i>

38:15.641 --> 38:18.268
Cool it, Jetson.
Just push the stupid button.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.383
Uh... yes, sir.

38:20.487 --> 38:24.809
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for!

38:32.228 --> 38:34.915
Spacely! Spacely! Spacely!

38:42.431 --> 38:46.466
- Yay, Daddy!
- That's my George!

39:23.268 --> 39:24.668
Here it comes.

39:25.720 --> 39:28.234
All right, 999.

39:32.792 --> 39:38.063
One mil... 998, 997.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.454
It's going backwards!

39:41.490 --> 39:43.604
Yeow!

39:46.587 --> 39:50.596
Oh, no! Not again!

39:52.495 --> 39:54.309
Look out!

39:56.537 --> 39:57.633
Ow!

39:59.277 --> 40:02.261
Watch out, Teddy 2! I'll save you!

40:02.365 --> 40:05.044
Elroy! Where's Elroy?

40:05.148 --> 40:06.723
And Teddy 2.

40:06.827 --> 40:09.532
Son! Son!

40:26.388 --> 40:29.815
<i>What the...? Jetson!</i>

40:30.024 --> 40:33.921
- Mr. Spa... Spa... Spa...
- <i>What's going on up there?</i>

40:34.025 --> 40:38.444
A bricken bracken's broken
in the sproken locken!

40:38.548 --> 40:40.752
I mean...

40:40.857 --> 40:43.909
new glitches always have plants.

40:44.593 --> 40:49.230
<i>You're destroying my plant!
Turn the machines off! Turn them off!</i>

40:49.542 --> 40:52.430
Yes, sir! Right away, sir!

40:58.049 --> 41:00.649
- It's off, sir.
- <i>Get it started soon.</i>

41:00.754 --> 41:02.841
<i>Lost time means lost money.</i>

41:02.945 --> 41:07.364
<i>And lost money means lost vice president.</i>

41:07.469 --> 41:09.530
<i>Get it?</i>

41:09.634 --> 41:12.714
So can I stay over
with Elroy tonight, Mom? Huh?

41:13.131 --> 41:17.576
Dear, I'm not sure that's a good idea
tonight, after what happened.

41:17.836 --> 41:22.934
Aw, Mom, please? Elroy saved me,
he's my new best friend.

41:24.508 --> 41:25.717
It's all right with me.

41:25.821 --> 41:30.642
Oh, all right.
But first let me give you a hand.

41:32.206 --> 41:34.720
Ah, that feels better.

41:34.824 --> 41:39.373
Say thanks to Mrs. Jetson,
be a good boy and stay well-oiled.

41:39.685 --> 41:41.183
All right!

41:41.287 --> 41:43.835
George, there's something you should know.

41:44.044 --> 41:49.053
Since the plant opened, there's
been an unusual amount of... of...

41:49.157 --> 41:51.078
- Glitches?
- Uh-huh.

41:51.182 --> 41:54.116
I thought we cleared them all up,
but they keep happening.

41:54.221 --> 41:56.812
It may be safer for you to just leave.

41:56.916 --> 42:01.683
What? And lose my chance
to be a vice president? No way!

42:01.788 --> 42:04.380
- But, George, there's...
- Not another word.

42:04.484 --> 42:06.790
George Jetson
doesn't run away from a glitch.

42:06.894 --> 42:09.338
We just need to make
a few repairs tomorrow,

42:09.442 --> 42:13.382
then the magic Jetson finger
will show just what it can do.

43:17.790 --> 43:18.991
You're in early.

43:19.095 --> 43:23.305
That's because today's the day
we're gonna lick these glitches, Rudy.

43:26.114 --> 43:29.271
- Ready?
- George, are you sure you want to do this?

43:29.375 --> 43:33.081
Yes. My first vice-presidential decision.

43:33.394 --> 43:35.317
Bingo!

43:37.395 --> 43:41.901
Circuit breaker's broken in the sprocket
locker bracket. I'll get a new one.

44:08.168 --> 44:11.951
George? Jogging? This early?

44:17.982 --> 44:19.983
Stop this crazy thing!

44:20.192 --> 44:22.981
I can't! I can't! It's stuck!

44:39.438 --> 44:43.326
<i>Now what, Jetson? What is it this time?</i>

44:43.587 --> 44:46.727
Just another little glitch, Mr. Spacely.

44:46.831 --> 44:49.649
<i>Another little glitch, eh?</i>

44:49.754 --> 44:50.813
Yes, sir.

44:50.917 --> 44:56.835
<i>I think I know what the glitch is, Jetson.
And I'm looking at him!</i>

44:58.617 --> 45:01.035
Gertrude, this is an emergency.

45:01.139 --> 45:04.765
Book me on the next cheap flight
to the asteroid.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.387
May I get you anything?

45:17.492 --> 45:20.083
Don't give those guys any more doughnuts.

45:35.278 --> 45:38.523
I didn't know the Galleria
had any place like this.

45:38.627 --> 45:42.038
- It's metagalactical!
- No, don't!

45:42.664 --> 45:45.603
- You all right?
- Uh-huh, I think.

45:49.378 --> 45:53.440
- This as all a hologram.
- Wow. It looks so real.

45:53.544 --> 45:57.582
You can punch up all kinds
of make-believe scenery.

45:59.354 --> 46:01.703
It's beautiful.

46:05.060 --> 46:07.879
That song you're playing,
is that the one you sent to me?

46:07.983 --> 46:10.357
Yeah, do you remember the words?

46:10.461 --> 46:12.384
Uh, I think so.

46:23.809 --> 46:27.182
<i>Give me one reason why you look so sad</i>

46:27.286 --> 46:30.783
<i>A heart like yours wasn't made for that</i>

46:30.887 --> 46:34.524
<i>Give me your hand, I'll pull you through</i>

46:34.628 --> 46:37.597
<i>Give me some time and I swear to you</i>

46:37.701 --> 46:41.074
<i>Every night, I'll be so close</i>

46:41.178 --> 46:45.414
<i>Every night, hey, don't you know</i>

46:45.518 --> 46:48.846
<i>You and me</i>

46:48.950 --> 46:52.750
<i>Were made to be in love</i>

46:52.855 --> 46:55.284
<i>Don't let them tear us apart</i>

46:55.389 --> 46:58.950
<i>You and me</i>

46:59.055 --> 47:02.937
<i>Were made for love</i>

47:07.453 --> 47:10.791
<i>Baby, you know it's a matter of fact</i>

47:10.896 --> 47:14.729
<i>I can't stand by when you feel like that</i>

47:14.833 --> 47:18.233
<i>Baby, you know when it comes to love</i>

47:18.338 --> 47:21.114
<i>I got time and that's time enough</i>

47:21.219 --> 47:24.851
<i>Every night, I'll be so close</i>

47:24.956 --> 47:29.345
<i>Every night, hey, don't you know</i>

47:29.450 --> 47:32.674
<i>You and me</i>

47:32.778 --> 47:36.407
<i>Were made to be in love</i>

47:36.511 --> 47:39.038
<i>Don't let them tear us apart</i>

47:39.143 --> 47:43.560
<i>You and me</i>

47:43.664 --> 47:47.321
<i>You're all I ever need</i>

47:47.425 --> 47:50.042
<i>Look in my eyes, can't you see?</i>

47:50.146 --> 47:54.366
<i>You and me</i>

48:02.752 --> 48:05.648
- That was great!
- Thanks.

48:05.753 --> 48:08.823
My boyfriend back home was a musician too.

48:08.928 --> 48:11.792
Uh, my former boyfriend.

48:11.896 --> 48:15.971
Well, isn't this a small galaxy.

48:22.609 --> 48:24.063
Mr. J!

48:24.506 --> 48:27.350
Don't say a word.

48:28.437 --> 48:32.047
- Poor Mr. J.
- All he needs is a good night's sleep.

48:32.151 --> 48:33.743
Or a chiropractor.

48:33.847 --> 48:38.370
Oh, I had no idea being
a vice president could be so dangerous.

48:38.474 --> 48:40.657
There's something going on, George.

48:40.762 --> 48:44.764
The two sprocket lockers were unscrewed
from the locked sprocket sockets.

48:44.868 --> 48:47.312
- Say that again.
- I can't.

48:47.416 --> 48:51.785
- You mean these weren't accidents?
- No, they were a warning.

48:51.889 --> 48:55.628
- A what?
- A warning. To close down the plant.

48:55.940 --> 49:00.394
I might as well tell you. We've been
getting them since the plant opened.

49:00.498 --> 49:03.577
It's why Spacely's gone
through four vice presidents.

49:03.681 --> 49:06.656
- Four?
- They all had accidents just like this

49:06.761 --> 49:09.213
- then left.
- Well, I'm not leaving.

49:09.317 --> 49:12.084
George Jetson doesn't scare that easily.

49:12.188 --> 49:15.449
Someone's sneaking in at night
and fouling things up.

49:15.554 --> 49:19.103
So that means we've got to
go back tonight and keep watch.

49:19.207 --> 49:21.391
- Good luck, George.
- Huh?

49:21.495 --> 49:25.122
I'm sorry, George. I like you,
but I've got to think about my family.

49:25.226 --> 49:29.192
- I've got three hungry oil spouts to fill.
- I understand, Rudy.

49:29.505 --> 49:32.063
This is a job
for a vice president, anyway.

49:32.167 --> 49:36.368
George Jetson is mad,
and he's not gonna take it anymore.

49:40.082 --> 49:45.093
Dad needs help. Tonight, I'll help him
solve the mystery of those accidents.

49:46.031 --> 49:48.763
All I need is my detecto kit.

49:48.867 --> 49:50.981
And me.

49:51.085 --> 49:55.330
- No, Teddy 2. I can't ask you to help.
- Well, you helped me.

49:55.434 --> 49:59.461
Besides, you don't even know
the layout of the plant. I'm going.

49:59.774 --> 50:02.907
Great! Me too.

50:03.610 --> 50:08.533
No, Astro. Not you too.
And not you, either, Fergie.

50:08.637 --> 50:10.508
Ohh!

50:10.612 --> 50:13.421
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

50:13.525 --> 50:16.509
Why not? Because Mom needs you here.

50:16.614 --> 50:19.823
- You've got to look after her.
- Right!

50:19.927 --> 50:23.189
Okay. Then as soon as it gets dark,
we sneak out the back,

50:23.293 --> 50:27.024
then we'll go down to the plant,
and we'll use my detecto kit.

50:39.498 --> 50:44.793
All right, vandals. Now you've got
George Jetson to deal with.

51:03.374 --> 51:06.610
I'll be waitin' for 'em,
eyes and ears open,

51:06.714 --> 51:10.636
coiled like a tiger, ready to spring.

52:02.354 --> 52:04.685
All clear.

52:12.296 --> 52:15.524
George? George?

52:19.158 --> 52:21.525
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

52:25.734 --> 52:27.719
Hmm.

52:28.657 --> 52:31.588
<i>Oh, Galaxina, just because I'm a robot</i>

52:31.693 --> 52:35.198
<i>doesn't mean we can't have children.</i>

52:35.302 --> 52:39.069
<i>Will Galaxina pull the plug
on her romance?</i>

52:45.001 --> 52:50.550
<i>Tune in tomorrow for another
episode of "All My Androids".</i>

52:50.654 --> 52:54.420
Rosie, be careful. You'll rust up again.

52:57.203 --> 53:02.162
- Mrs. Jetson, did George come home?
- No, he's at the plant.

53:02.266 --> 53:06.337
No, he's not. I was just there.
He's... he's disappeared.

53:06.441 --> 53:10.990
Disappeared? Oh, no! Elroy and Teddy 2!

53:11.824 --> 53:14.390
Oh, no! Elroy!

53:15.913 --> 53:19.845
- Where could those kids have gone?
- Elroy detective.

53:19.949 --> 53:24.115
Detective?
Elroy's playing detective? Where?

53:25.881 --> 53:29.473
Oh, no! The plant!
Is that where he's gone?

53:29.578 --> 53:32.935
- Right! With Teddy 2!
- With Teddy 2!

53:33.039 --> 53:36.562
You sure? I didn't see them there,
and the plant's all locked up.

53:36.666 --> 53:39.266
I don't know how they'd get in.

53:41.606 --> 53:45.163
I didn't remember the vent was so high.

53:47.321 --> 53:51.705
- My detecto kit has a rope.
- Rope?

53:57.637 --> 54:01.133
Grab my ankles. I'll show you my elevator.

54:01.237 --> 54:03.460
Wow!

54:06.413 --> 54:09.966
Going up! Going in!

54:40.692 --> 54:42.593
- <i>Excuse me.</i>
- Mother?

54:42.697 --> 54:46.102
<i>I'm sorry, guys, but you know
I wouldn't call if it weren't important.</i>

54:46.206 --> 54:49.929
- <i>Is Elroy with you?</i>
- Elroy? No.

54:50.033 --> 54:53.756
<i>He and Teddy have wandered off.
I need you to help me find them.</i>

54:53.861 --> 54:57.627
<i>Search the mall, search the school.
They might be at the plant.</i>

54:57.731 --> 54:59.801
- Now?
- <i>Now.</i>

55:02.037 --> 55:04.751
<i>I knew you'd understand.</i>

55:10.134 --> 55:13.665
The light switch is over here somewhere.

55:19.302 --> 55:21.659
What was that noise?

55:42.830 --> 55:45.501
Here's the light switch.

55:48.179 --> 55:51.857
- There's that noise.
- It came from over here.

55:53.459 --> 55:57.494
- There it is again.
- I'll get some fingerprint powder.

56:00.678 --> 56:04.948
I wonder where Dad is.
Hey! Where's my kit?

56:05.053 --> 56:07.749
Huh? What's going on?

56:16.360 --> 56:19.570
Ready, set, go!

56:19.675 --> 56:22.041
- Fergie!
- Gotcha!

56:22.145 --> 56:23.866
Grungee!

56:23.971 --> 56:25.902
Grungee?

56:27.346 --> 56:29.868
Aw, Grungee.

56:29.972 --> 56:33.278
How do you know what he is, Fergie?

56:34.112 --> 56:38.532
Fergie, Grungees play. Squeep!

56:38.636 --> 56:42.281
- Squeep? And you play with them?
- Uh-huh.

56:42.802 --> 56:46.080
- Squeep.
- Squeep.

56:46.281 --> 56:49.395
So, it's you little guys
causing the accidents.

56:49.708 --> 56:52.831
Trying to shut down the plant
and get my father fired.

56:52.935 --> 56:55.451
Wait till he hears about...

57:09.200 --> 57:11.213
I'm programmed for most languages

57:11.421 --> 57:14.893
and I can tell you the Grungee community
is not very happy

57:14.998 --> 57:18.185
- with what we're doing here.
- What are we doing here?

57:18.290 --> 57:21.281
He says we've been destroying their town.

57:21.385 --> 57:25.448
My dad? No way! I want to see for myself.

57:32.450 --> 57:35.885
Elroy Jetson, hold it right there!

57:35.990 --> 57:38.582
Well, well, look what we've got here.

57:38.686 --> 57:42.148
Elroy, you're coming home with me right...

57:42.252 --> 57:46.135
- Hey, what's that cute little guy?
- That's Squeep.

57:46.239 --> 57:51.246
I believe we've solved the mystery.
He's the reason the plant's being sabotaged.

57:51.559 --> 57:56.600
Come with us. Will you, guys? I've got
a feeling we're gonna need your help.

58:02.127 --> 58:05.372
Teddy, are you programmed to be scared?

58:05.476 --> 58:08.443
- No.
- I am.

58:23.942 --> 58:27.726
Come on, follow me. Come on, come on.

58:27.830 --> 58:30.921
Gee, I don't know about this.

58:31.025 --> 58:34.145
Yeah. Where are we anyway?

58:36.397 --> 58:38.841
Yike! Ah!

58:41.503 --> 58:42.799
Shh.

58:48.366 --> 58:50.180
Wow!

58:50.493 --> 58:53.631
Hello? Anyone, hello?

59:04.309 --> 59:06.176
Hey!

59:07.475 --> 59:11.720
- Look at these little guys.
- Yeah, they're great.

59:13.346 --> 59:15.820
They're so cute.

59:21.539 --> 59:25.785
Oh, no. What are we doing?

59:29.732 --> 59:33.037
We're destroying their homes.

59:39.657 --> 59:41.945
Is everything all right back here?

59:42.736 --> 59:45.555
Oh, what a way to fly.

59:50.303 --> 59:52.676
Elroy!

59:52.780 --> 59:54.383
Teddy!

59:54.487 --> 59:56.808
George!

01:00:02.942 --> 01:00:05.838
Elroy! George!

01:00:05.943 --> 01:00:07.082
Are they down there?

01:00:08.247 --> 01:00:10.126
There, down there.

01:00:10.579 --> 01:00:15.102
How awful, you poor thing.
We've got to do something.

01:00:15.415 --> 01:00:17.346
But what?

01:00:20.042 --> 01:00:23.282
Really don't like the looks of this.

01:00:24.234 --> 01:00:26.627
Are you sure they're down there, Astro?

01:00:26.731 --> 01:00:29.627
Right. I hope so.

01:00:29.731 --> 01:00:32.193
We'll just get Dad to shut down the plant.

01:00:32.297 --> 01:00:34.933
He can't do that. It's his job.

01:00:35.037 --> 01:00:38.195
And my dad's too.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.875
- Astro!
- Elroy!

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:49.354
But where's Mom?
You're supposed to be looking after mom.

01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:52.950
Right here, son. And you've got
a lot of explaining to do.

01:00:53.054 --> 01:00:55.408
Are you all right, Mrs. J?

01:00:57.565 --> 01:01:01.280
I'm fine. I found everybody.

01:01:02.227 --> 01:01:04.918
Except George.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:10.308
George? George!

01:01:17.683 --> 01:01:19.645
George?

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.164
Oh, George! I love you, George!

01:01:25.476 --> 01:01:28.816
- Dad. Dad.
- George! What happened?

01:01:33.427 --> 01:01:36.601
- Are you all right, Dad?
- No! I'm not all right!

01:01:36.705 --> 01:01:39.776
I was kidnapped
by these vicious little furballs

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.255
with beady eyes and razor teeth.

01:01:42.359 --> 01:01:45.838
But, Dad, they were just trying
to save their homes.

01:01:45.943 --> 01:01:49.605
- You're destroying their city.
- They didn't know what else to do.

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.469
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:14.603
What's that?

01:02:14.707 --> 01:02:18.917
Uh, darling, I'm afraid
we have to have a little talk.

01:02:21.352 --> 01:02:24.747
You want me to do what?

01:02:24.996 --> 01:02:28.806
I'm finally a vice president
after years of "yes, Mr. Spacely,"

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:33.115
"absolutely, Mr. Spacely,"
"oh, and by the way, Mr. Spacely,

01:02:33.219 --> 01:02:37.148
now that I'm a vice president,
my family wants me to close your plant

01:02:37.252 --> 01:02:40.357
and lose my job,
just as I've reached the top."

01:02:40.462 --> 01:02:44.733
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:02:44.837 --> 01:02:46.272
And that's final!

01:02:46.376 --> 01:02:49.491
Well, we'll just see about that.

01:02:49.595 --> 01:02:52.325
Now, could someone please untie me?

01:02:52.429 --> 01:02:54.653
Not yet.

01:02:57.945 --> 01:03:00.406
First, we negotiate.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.233
What? Are you Jane Jetson?
Are you my wife?

01:03:05.338 --> 01:03:09.507
- Do you love me?
- Yes, but do you love your family?

01:03:09.612 --> 01:03:12.105
'Course I do. You're all I think about.

01:03:12.209 --> 01:03:14.888
All you've thought about lately
is your job.

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:19.890
Yeah, Dad. You've been so wrapped up
in work, you haven't had time for us.

01:03:20.203 --> 01:03:23.020
Okay, I'll put in for a long vacation,

01:03:23.124 --> 01:03:25.890
but it'll have to wait
until I get the plant going again.

01:03:25.995 --> 01:03:29.283
- That's no good, George.
- What else do you want?

01:03:29.701 --> 01:03:35.111
George, all I ask is that you look around
and see what your job is making you do.

01:03:35.215 --> 01:03:38.982
No job is worth destroying
the lives of innocent creatures.

01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:41.503
See for yourself.

01:03:45.287 --> 01:03:48.158
Oh, my gosh, it's a city.

01:03:48.262 --> 01:03:52.184
It's more than a city.
It's their entire world,

01:03:52.289 --> 01:03:54.412
and you're destroying it...

01:03:54.516 --> 01:03:56.934
and them.

01:03:57.038 --> 01:04:01.361
Mr. Jetson, the Grungees really feel bad
about taking you down here.

01:04:01.466 --> 01:04:03.901
But as you can see, they were desperate.

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:06.710
But... but what can I do?

01:04:06.815 --> 01:04:09.163
Jetson? Jetson!

01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:10.641
Mr. Spacely.

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:13.408
Where's Jetson?
And why is the plant shut down?

01:04:13.512 --> 01:04:17.392
- It's the middle of the night.
- Machines don't sleep! Start it up!

01:04:17.496 --> 01:04:19.758
Every second lost means money lost.

01:04:19.862 --> 01:04:22.662
And money lost means I scream a lot!

01:04:22.766 --> 01:04:26.081
- But what about the Jetsons? They're all...
- Forget that idiot Jetson.

01:04:26.185 --> 01:04:30.524
I'm gonna get my millionth sprocket
if I have to do it myself.

01:04:38.762 --> 01:04:41.954
How dare you, you pile of bolts.

01:04:42.058 --> 01:04:45.120
You don't understand, there's...

01:04:45.233 --> 01:04:49.138
There, that's better.
Nobody pushes Spacely.

01:05:10.013 --> 01:05:12.815
- What's happening?
- Someone's started the plant.

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:28.819
We got to... to... get out of here!

01:05:41.918 --> 01:05:45.815
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.616
Oh, no! Squeep! Hang on!

01:05:53.939 --> 01:05:55.768
Elroy!

01:06:27.904 --> 01:06:32.810
- He's got Squeep!
- Elroy! Oh, thank God you're safe, son.

01:06:32.914 --> 01:06:35.184
Oh, Elroy, darling.

01:06:35.288 --> 01:06:38.038
I was afraid. I was so afraid.

01:06:38.142 --> 01:06:42.629
I'm okay, Mom. I'm okay.
Squeep's okay too.

01:06:43.221 --> 01:06:46.640
- Thank all of you.
- Yay!

01:06:47.057 --> 01:06:50.754
Come on. Come on, everyone.
We've got to stop the drilling.

01:06:50.858 --> 01:06:52.537
Come on!

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:56.782
I never should've put that dummy Jetson
in charge of an operation this important.

01:06:56.886 --> 01:06:59.460
When I get home,
I'll get a new vice president.

01:06:59.565 --> 01:07:02.914
- You've already got a vice president.
- Jeston!

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:06.732
Yes, sir, Mr. Spacely.
That dummy, George Jeston.

01:07:06.836 --> 01:07:08.732
What do you think you're doing, Jetson?

01:07:08.836 --> 01:07:12.037
Turning off the plant
before you do any more damage.

01:07:12.142 --> 01:07:14.908
Stay away from this button,
that's an order!

01:07:15.012 --> 01:07:17.735
No, sir, Mr. Spacely.

01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:21.371
- What?
- I said, no, sir, Mr. Spacely.

01:07:21.475 --> 01:07:24.632
- Yay, Daddy!
- My gosh, that felt good.

01:07:26.406 --> 01:07:31.704
Mr. Spacely, you can't stand
in the way of George Jetson!

01:07:31.808 --> 01:07:34.318
Geronimo!

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:32.609
- That's my George!
- Oh, George!

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:39.886
What's gotten into you, Jetson?
There better be a good explanation for this.

01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:41.826
Oh, there is, all right.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:45.662
Did you know about these wonderful
little creatures, Mr. Spacely,

01:08:45.767 --> 01:08:49.002
when you decided to mine this asteroid?

01:08:49.106 --> 01:08:52.290
- What creatures, Jetson?
- These creatures.

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.265
These wonderful creatures.

01:08:54.368 --> 01:08:57.613
You money-grabbing,
insensitive, lying old goat!

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.979
You did, didn't you?

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:03.371
Well, I may have heard something about...

01:09:03.475 --> 01:09:06.859
You heard. All you care about is money.

01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:09.033
- Yeah!
- But they're useless.

01:09:09.138 --> 01:09:12.417
And I'm here to tell you
they're not one bit useless.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.723
They just saved my boy's life
is what they did.

01:09:15.827 --> 01:09:17.566
The Grungees don't mean any harm.

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:22.332
Mr. Spacely, this whole planet
is about different kinds of life forms.

01:09:22.437 --> 01:09:24.834
Working together for the good of everyone.

01:09:24.938 --> 01:09:28.813
What do you expect me to do?
I can't just close the plant.

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:33.274
Then figure out a way to keep the plant
and let the Grungees have their homes.

01:09:33.379 --> 01:09:37.075
Can't you find it in your heart
to reach a compromise?

01:09:37.179 --> 01:09:40.441
Think about all the profits you've lost.

01:09:42.825 --> 01:09:47.496
But think of all the profits you'd make
if you worked with the Grungees.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.002
- You mean hire all of them?
- No, I mean become partners.

01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:56.411
They run the plant and sell you
the sprockets at a fair price.

01:09:56.515 --> 01:09:58.438
Fair?

01:09:58.751 --> 01:10:02.474
Otherwise, you'll never get
your millionth sprocket.

01:10:02.578 --> 01:10:04.722
Ahh!

01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:40.918
I don't believe it!
They've doubled production.

01:10:41.335 --> 01:10:44.267
And they found a way
to recycle the old sprockets.

01:10:44.372 --> 01:10:48.251
Now, no one will ever
have to mine this asteroid again.

01:10:49.643 --> 01:10:53.495
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-nine.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.398
One million.

01:10:57.939 --> 01:11:01.358
- Outergalactic?
- The outergalactic-est

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:06.882
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:14.536
- What did he say?
- Let's hear it for Mr. Spacely.

01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:18.407
Spacely!

01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:23.591
I think I'm gonna be sick. Jetson,
I think you've done quite enough here.

01:11:23.695 --> 01:11:27.410
Yes, sir, Mr. Spacely.
Will I be getting a promotion?

01:11:27.514 --> 01:11:32.192
A promotion? You're lucky
I'm giving you your old job back.

01:11:32.297 --> 01:11:34.969
But what about vice president?

01:11:37.515 --> 01:11:42.579
All right, all right,
you're a vice president, but no raise!

01:11:43.517 --> 01:11:47.023
- Does this mean we have to leave?
- Well, yes, son.

01:11:47.127 --> 01:11:49.058
With the Grungees running the plant,

01:11:49.163 --> 01:11:53.103
Spacely Sprockets
doesn't need me here anymore.

01:11:59.418 --> 01:12:02.705
Well, I guess it's good...
goodbye, Apollo.

01:12:02.809 --> 01:12:06.419
Hey, it's okay.
I'll come visit, I promise.

01:12:06.524 --> 01:12:09.733
In the meantime, here's the demo
of the song I wrote for us.

01:12:09.837 --> 01:12:14.247
- Oh, Apollo.
- Some dude might turn it into a hit.

01:12:14.351 --> 01:12:16.943
Maybe Cosmic Cosmo?

01:12:17.048 --> 01:12:21.989
Uh-uh. This is ours. Just ours. Always.

01:12:32.487 --> 01:12:35.766
Hey, your friends are calling.

01:12:37.931 --> 01:12:41.298
- Elroy.
- See you, Squeep.

01:12:41.402 --> 01:12:44.777
Can I use that move of yours,
the Elroy Elevator?

01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:50.039
Didn't do me much good,
but sure, if you want to.

01:12:50.143 --> 01:12:52.789
Maybe someday we'll play on the same team.

01:12:52.893 --> 01:12:55.718
We already have. And we won.

01:12:57.319 --> 01:13:00.268
I'm gonna miss this place a lot.

01:13:00.372 --> 01:13:05.044
It shows that you can make friends and
prove yourself anywhere in the universe.

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:08.462
I know, Dad. But leaving's still hard.

01:13:08.566 --> 01:13:12.150
Yeah, it is. I know.

01:13:14.203 --> 01:13:17.699
Goodbye! Thank you for everything.

01:13:17.803 --> 01:13:22.135
Goodbye, George. And lots of luck.

01:13:22.239 --> 01:13:24.553
Thanks. Goodbye.

01:13:25.528 --> 01:13:28.180
Lots of luck. See ya!

01:13:28.806 --> 01:13:31.790
- Bye! Bye!
- Bye! Bye-bye!

01:13:31.894 --> 01:13:35.356
- Where's Fergie?
- Here she is.

01:13:41.415 --> 01:13:44.288
- Mama.
- Bye-bye.

01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:09.984
Look. Look, Dad. It's the Grungees.

01:14:15.105 --> 01:14:18.567
Well, that sure
was nice of 'em, wasn't it?

01:21:47.981 --> 01:21:50.921
I love you, George.
