00:01.919 --> 00:04.296
Boys, I found the beer

00:01.919 --> 00:04.296
you hid in the garage.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.840
After all our talks

00:05.881 --> 00:08.049
about drinking,

00:05.881 --> 00:08.049
you still think it's cool?!

00:08.091 --> 00:10.719
Well, it's not!

00:08.091 --> 00:10.719
Now, sit down and watch!

00:12.011 --> 00:13.054
Look at me!

00:13.096 --> 00:14.723
I'm Mr. Cool.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.350
Mmm!

00:16.391 --> 00:18.644
Everybody digs my scene.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.104
(slurred):

00:18.686 --> 00:21.104
I'm the grooviest dude

00:21.146 --> 00:23.899
who was ever grooved on.

00:24.817 --> 00:27.152
I just love you boys so much.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.071
(sniffles)

00:27.194 --> 00:30.071
Who wants a hug?

Yeah, but it was  so  worth

Guess what?

01:18.871 --> 01:20.205
I got another raise.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.123
Mr. DeSilvio said

01:20.247 --> 01:22.123
that when I clean the gunk

01:22.165 --> 01:23.625
out of the rendering machine,

01:23.667 --> 01:26.628
I vomit less than anyone

01:23.667 --> 01:26.628
who's ever worked there.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.130
Oh, glad someone's

01:26.670 --> 01:29.130
career's on track.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.842
My company may not

01:29.172 --> 01:31.842
even exist in a month.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.301
Well, what does Nate

01:31.884 --> 01:33.301
have to say?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.303
He's usually pretty levelheaded

01:33.343 --> 01:35.303
about this stuff.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.973
Nate faked his death

01:35.345 --> 01:37.973
and fled the country.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.058
Didn't he, Jamie?

01:39.098 --> 01:40.517
Yes, he did.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.517
(babbles)

01:40.559 --> 01:41.852
Dad-dad.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.186
(door opens)

01:44.563 --> 01:48.025
Here! Do these look like

01:44.563 --> 01:48.025
the hands of a lazy man?

01:48.067 --> 01:50.402
Do they?! You see how hard

01:48.067 --> 01:50.402
the calluses are?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.195
What are you doing here?

01:52.237 --> 01:55.657
This morning, on the phone,

01:52.237 --> 01:55.657
you said that I was lazy.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.201
Well, look at my hands,

01:55.699 --> 01:58.201
and admit that you were wrong.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.327
Are you biting

01:58.243 --> 01:59.327
your nails again?

01:59.369 --> 02:01.246
Apologize!

02:01.288 --> 02:03.248
I am not going to apologize

02:01.288 --> 02:03.248
for something

02:03.290 --> 02:04.541
that I said that's true.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.167
This is exactly why I drove

02:06.209 --> 02:08.087
eight straight hours

02:06.209 --> 02:08.087
to get here.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.880
To prove how

02:08.128 --> 02:09.880
far you'll go

02:09.922 --> 02:11.423
just to avoid a simple apology.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.175
I can't believe how screwed-up

02:11.465 --> 02:14.175
your priorities are.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.803
(phone ringing)

02:15.844 --> 02:17.262
Hello?

02:17.304 --> 02:18.889
(sweetly):

02:17.304 --> 02:18.889
Oh, hi, baby.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.015
Happy anniversary.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.017
No, I haven't

02:20.057 --> 02:22.017
left yet.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.186
I'm on my way out

02:22.059 --> 02:25.186
right now. Okay.

02:25.228 --> 02:28.356
Seeing Francis act like this

02:25.228 --> 02:28.356
is really sad.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.399
I mean, for him.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.192
For us, it's kinda funny.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.987
Okay, Malcolm, let's go!

02:31.234 --> 02:32.987
We got to get to work.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.404
And don't forget

02:33.028 --> 02:34.404
to change your shoes.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.907
Okay. Can I eat

02:34.446 --> 02:36.907
my cupcake in the car?

02:36.949 --> 02:38.867
I was going to eat it

02:36.949 --> 02:38.867
in the car,

02:38.909 --> 02:40.869
whether she said I could or not.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.831
It's pathetic to watch Francis

02:40.911 --> 02:43.831
when he's around Mom.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.291
It's almost like

02:43.872 --> 02:46.291
he's her puppet or something.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.919
Yeah, it's really awful

02:46.333 --> 02:48.919
how she manipulates him.

02:48.961 --> 02:53.841
Boy, I sure

02:48.961 --> 02:53.841
love this vanilla!

02:58.637 --> 03:00.263
Why would anyone do

02:58.637 --> 03:00.263
something like that?

03:00.305 --> 03:02.141
Well, there is a

03:00.305 --> 03:02.141
certain pleasure

03:02.181 --> 03:05.144
in secretly controlling

03:02.181 --> 03:05.144
someone a lot dumber than you.

03:05.184 --> 03:08.480
Hey, you know what was

03:05.184 --> 03:08.480
really cool about Francis?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.525
How he used to pull

03:08.522 --> 03:11.525
all those crazy stunts.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.152
Yeah, that stuff

03:11.566 --> 03:13.152
was pretty awesome.

03:13.192 --> 03:14.277
Yeah.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.738
Too bad there's

03:14.319 --> 03:16.738
nothing like that now.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.074
Except for Kopelman's junkyard.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.659
You mean, with all

03:19.116 --> 03:20.659
those vicious dogs?

03:20.701 --> 03:23.620
Remember how Francis set the

03:20.701 --> 03:23.620
record by going over the fence

03:23.662 --> 03:26.623
and coming back with

03:23.662 --> 03:26.623
11 old toilet seats?

03:26.665 --> 03:29.376
If only someone had

03:26.665 --> 03:29.376
the guts to do that now.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.253
By "someone," I meant you.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.672
You think?

03:33.714 --> 03:36.299
Took me four hours

03:33.714 --> 03:36.299
to find this old spelling test.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.634
C plus!

03:37.676 --> 03:39.511
Do lazy people get C pluses?

03:39.553 --> 03:40.971
No!

03:41.013 --> 03:42.973
Man, I got to get back

03:41.013 --> 03:42.973
on the road.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.265
When's Mom coming home?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.266
Not till after 10:00.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.768
(sighs)

03:48.311 --> 03:51.065
Well, traffic will be

03:48.311 --> 03:51.065
better, anyway.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.482
LOIS:

03:51.106 --> 03:52.482
All I'm saying is,

03:52.524 --> 03:54.275
if you don't put the pinks

03:52.524 --> 03:54.275
and the yellows together

03:54.317 --> 03:56.319
by date, you're not going to be

03:54.317 --> 03:56.319
able to find them later.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.113
And I know, you want to live

03:56.361 --> 03:58.113
in the dorm

03:58.155 --> 03:59.280
when you go away to college,

03:59.322 --> 04:00.574
but you're

03:59.322 --> 04:00.574
too easily distracted.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.283
You don't get

04:00.615 --> 04:02.283
to criticize decisions

04:02.325 --> 04:03.911
I won't even make

04:02.325 --> 04:03.911
for three years.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.286
Okay, you're getting cranky.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.329
Let's take a break.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.165
Look, we're

04:06.371 --> 04:08.165
over halfway done.

04:08.207 --> 04:11.292
Aren't you glad I didn't let you

04:08.207 --> 04:11.292
go to the bathroom before?

04:11.334 --> 04:14.129
Hey, Malcolm, you want to

04:11.334 --> 04:14.129
sign up for the softball team?

04:14.171 --> 04:16.506
It's a chance to see

04:14.171 --> 04:16.506
the old Satin Hammer in action.

04:16.548 --> 04:19.300
And every season, I take one

04:16.548 --> 04:19.300
lucky youngster under my wing.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.386
I'm already

04:19.342 --> 04:21.386
under a thumb.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.386
Well, if you're on the team,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.223
you don't have to work

04:21.428 --> 04:24.223
the early weekend shift.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.307
My mom works that shift.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.307
I'm in!

04:26.349 --> 04:28.518
Hey, Lois. You signing up

04:26.349 --> 04:28.518
for softball?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.020
I don't need

04:28.560 --> 04:30.020
to sign up, Craig.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.396
I'm coaching the

04:30.062 --> 04:31.396
team this year.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.023
You are?

04:33.065 --> 04:35.192
Yeah, Stu was going to

04:33.065 --> 04:35.192
do it, but his wife

04:35.234 --> 04:37.318
got born again and

04:35.234 --> 04:37.318
ruined his Sundays.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.362
Hey, Malcolm,

04:37.360 --> 04:39.362
you're playing!

04:39.404 --> 04:43.366
I just can't get away

04:39.404 --> 04:43.366
from you, can I?

04:49.539 --> 04:52.126
MAN (quietly):

04:49.539 --> 04:52.126
That's the base pay?

04:52.167 --> 04:53.961
And there's full dental?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.336
Sounds good.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.714
Where's the interview?

04:57.756 --> 05:01.051
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.177
Thanks.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.804
I owe you one.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.072
HAL:

05:20.487 --> 05:22.072
So, I'm going in

05:22.114 --> 05:23.782
three days ahead of him

05:22.114 --> 05:23.782
for the interview.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.367
I mean, Nick won't have

05:23.824 --> 05:26.367
any trouble finding another job.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.162
They guy's an ex-Navy Seal.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.580
Of course, ethically,

05:28.203 --> 05:30.580
you could argue it's stealing.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.748
But look at hip-hop!

05:31.790 --> 05:33.374
They sample music

05:31.790 --> 05:33.374
all the time.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.751
Is that stealing,

05:33.416 --> 05:34.751
or is that art?

05:34.793 --> 05:36.544
Hal, you have a family.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.544
Go in for the interview.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.588
I've got to figure out

05:36.586 --> 05:38.588
whether I'm going to bat

05:38.630 --> 05:40.799
my left-handed speedster

05:38.630 --> 05:40.799
at the top of the order

05:40.841 --> 05:42.425
or drop him lower,

05:40.841 --> 05:42.425
so he can hit

05:42.467 --> 05:44.427
behind the runners and stay

05:42.467 --> 05:44.427
out of the double play.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.013
There.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.639
20 years worth

05:46.054 --> 05:47.639
of connect-the-dot puzzles,

05:47.681 --> 05:49.808
model airplanes

05:47.681 --> 05:49.808
and dirty haikus.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.019
Do lazy people do

05:49.850 --> 05:52.019
this kind of stuff?

05:52.060 --> 05:53.770
I don't think so!

05:53.812 --> 05:55.814
This proves that you owe me

05:53.812 --> 05:55.814
an apology.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.398
Francis, all this

05:55.856 --> 05:57.398
proves is that you have

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
a problem with

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
obsessive compulsion.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.402
Lies on top of lies!

06:01.444 --> 06:04.489
Well, your house of cards

06:01.444 --> 06:04.489
is coming down!

06:04.531 --> 06:05.782
Is he still here?

06:05.824 --> 06:08.409
I told Piama

06:05.824 --> 06:08.409
he left this morning.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.454
Mom, I can't do

06:09.744 --> 06:11.454
the softball team, after all.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.333
Now, before you come up with

06:11.496 --> 06:14.333
what you think my reasons are,

06:14.373 --> 06:15.876
let me tell you

06:14.373 --> 06:15.876
what my reasons are.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.418
I've just got

06:15.917 --> 06:17.418
so much schoolwork.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.795
You don't have to play.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.131
You're always telling me

06:18.837 --> 06:21.131
that my grades are...

06:21.173 --> 06:22.423
Oh, well, good.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.092
It's too bad, 'cause

06:22.465 --> 06:24.092
I could have really

06:24.134 --> 06:25.593
helped you with

06:24.134 --> 06:25.593
your grounders.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.511
What?

06:26.553 --> 06:27.929
Your grounders.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.681
You don't go down

06:27.971 --> 06:29.681
to your knee for the ball.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.432
You know, kids your age,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.432
you don't think

06:31.474 --> 06:32.684
you need

06:31.474 --> 06:32.684
the fundamentals, but...

06:32.726 --> 06:34.853
I field grounders all the time.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.437
There's no problem

06:34.895 --> 06:36.437
with my grounders.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.480
Where do you get

06:36.479 --> 06:37.480
this stuff?

06:37.522 --> 06:38.940
It doesn't matter, Malcolm.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.319
Like you said, you got too

06:38.982 --> 06:42.319
much schoolwork, anyway.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.115
As soon as I figure out

06:44.487 --> 06:47.115
how she got me here,

06:47.157 --> 06:48.449
I'm out of here.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.826
Never mind.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.162
I'm just going to ignore

06:49.868 --> 06:52.162
her and do my homework.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.706
What are you working on,

06:53.372 --> 06:54.706
sweetheart?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.875
Just finishing a paper on

06:54.748 --> 06:56.875
Wuthering Heights.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.377
Wuthering Heights,  huh?

06:58.417 --> 07:00.295
I did my senior thesis

06:58.417 --> 07:00.295
on that.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.504
You did not.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.382
I hope you're not sticking

07:01.546 --> 07:03.382
to that tired view

07:03.422 --> 07:05.175
that Catherine and Heathcliff

07:03.422 --> 07:05.175
are soul mates.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.634
You picked up on

07:06.676 --> 07:08.469
the subtle hostility

07:06.676 --> 07:08.469
towards romanticism, right?

07:08.511 --> 07:09.846
I mean, Catherine's

07:09.888 --> 07:11.890
just as bound to Edgar

07:09.888 --> 07:11.890
as she is to Heathcliff.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.309
She takes a lock of  his  hair

07:11.932 --> 07:14.309
to the grave, too.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.894
Well, duh!

07:17.520 --> 07:20.357
GIRL: Is this where they keep

07:17.520 --> 07:20.357
the prisoners?

07:20.399 --> 07:21.400
What?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.068
My dad's in left field.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.154
He likes to keep an eye on me,

07:23.110 --> 07:26.154
'cause he thinks I'm too wild.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.656
My name's Stephanie.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.656
I'm...

07:28.698 --> 07:30.658
Malcolm, infield.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.658
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

07:30.700 --> 07:32.493
And you better be wearing a cup!

07:32.535 --> 07:34.579
(sighs)

07:36.539 --> 07:37.958
I know you've heard the rumors,

07:37.999 --> 07:40.127
and all I can say is,

07:37.999 --> 07:40.127
I might or might not

07:40.168 --> 07:42.545
have been scouted

07:40.168 --> 07:42.545
by the Kyoto Crazy Phantoms.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.546
But don't worry.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.174
I play for Lucky Aide.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.675
Now, watch me carefully,

07:47.717 --> 07:50.595
'cause I only work

07:47.717 --> 07:50.595
at one speed-- lightnin'.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.223
This one's for you, Malcolm.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.521
Try again.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.521
Here's another one.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.109
Is she crazy?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.610
How does she expect...?

08:14.577 --> 08:15.787
Craig, that was amazing.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.372
What were you expecting?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.873
I told you I was good.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.550
(barking, growling)

08:29.592 --> 08:31.052
I don't know, Reese.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.264
If I were you, I'd

08:31.094 --> 08:34.264
chicken out right now.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.975
Dewey, why are you always

08:34.306 --> 08:36.975
fighting me on these things?

08:37.017 --> 08:40.270
If you're not going to support

08:37.017 --> 08:40.270
me, you might as well leave.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.564
(barking, growling)

08:43.606 --> 08:46.609
Okay, so it's pretty obvious

08:43.606 --> 08:46.609
they hate shoes.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.778
Write that down.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.677
Um...

09:12.719 --> 09:14.012
am I...

09:12.719 --> 09:14.012
is this where...?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.889
We're  not  supposed to talk.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.182
Oh.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.850
Sorry.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.067
Uh... excuse me?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.067
I...

09:27.108 --> 09:29.610
WOMAN: We'll be with you

09:27.108 --> 09:29.610
in three seconds, sir.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.904
Please stand

09:29.652 --> 09:30.904
up straight.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.073
Three seconds?

09:30.945 --> 09:33.073
(gasps)

09:35.658 --> 09:37.536
So, I understand

09:35.658 --> 09:37.536
you'd like to work with us?

09:37.577 --> 09:40.705
I-I-I did...

09:37.577 --> 09:40.705
I just... did someone...?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.665
This job

09:40.747 --> 09:42.665
is a wonderful opportunity

09:42.707 --> 09:44.418
for the right kind of person.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.337
Good pay, three weeks vacation.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.337
Full benefits package.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.630
Plus the knowledge that you're

09:47.379 --> 09:49.630
really making a difference.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.924
(alarm blaring in distance)

09:50.965 --> 09:52.633
MAN (over intercom):

09:50.965 --> 09:52.633
Code Two, Code Two.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.885
Repeat, Code Two.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.636
(rapid footsteps,

09:53.927 --> 09:55.636
muffled gunshots)

09:55.678 --> 09:56.930
(door slams)

09:56.971 --> 09:58.639
Excuse me, was this...?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.725
Please, if you could hold off

09:58.681 --> 10:00.725
on your questions

10:00.767 --> 10:02.643
until I'm finished with mine.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.897
Number one, do you have

10:02.685 --> 10:05.897
a photographic memory?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.648
I don't think so.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.485
Uh-huh. Are you allergic

10:07.690 --> 10:10.485
to  venomous  spider bites?

10:10.527 --> 10:12.653
How would I know that?

10:12.695 --> 10:13.905
Right.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.656
And do you have

10:13.947 --> 10:15.656
an identical twin?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.534
What? No.

10:17.576 --> 10:18.743
Okay.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.121
That's all I have.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.663
Go next door.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.374
They'll make a mold

10:22.705 --> 10:24.374
of your face.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.708
Then we can get started.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.216
(gasping)

10:36.970 --> 10:38.638
(whirring)

10:43.726 --> 10:45.103
Thank you

10:43.726 --> 10:45.103
for your interest, sir.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.063
Any feelings of paranoia

10:45.145 --> 10:47.063
you may experience

10:47.105 --> 10:50.317
over the next few days

10:47.105 --> 10:50.317
are completely normal.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.540
Okay, remember-- it's

11:02.412 --> 11:05.540
hips, then shoulders.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.375
It's just like

11:05.582 --> 11:07.375
that little dance

11:07.417 --> 11:08.751
you used to do

11:07.417 --> 11:08.751
in your underpants.

11:08.793 --> 11:09.752
MAN:

11:08.793 --> 11:09.752
What do you know.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.505
Looks like store 617's

11:11.546 --> 11:13.714
actually thinking

11:11.546 --> 11:13.714
about showing up

11:13.756 --> 11:15.509
for the game next week.

11:15.550 --> 11:16.926
Considering what

11:15.550 --> 11:16.926
happened last year,

11:16.968 --> 11:18.719
that's pretty brave of you.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.556
We lost by three runs

11:18.761 --> 11:21.556
and had a barbecue, Mel.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.392
And it wasn't on my watch.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.520
So, can I see the

11:24.434 --> 11:26.520
underwear dance?

11:26.561 --> 11:28.771
Yeah, you'd like that,

11:26.561 --> 11:28.771
wouldn't you?

11:28.813 --> 11:30.106
Would you?

11:30.148 --> 11:31.816
Slow down, we haven't

11:30.148 --> 11:31.816
even kissed yet.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.193
Malcolm, let's go,

11:31.858 --> 11:33.193
we got to get

11:33.234 --> 11:34.653
to your zit doctor

11:33.234 --> 11:34.653
before 5:00.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.655
Mom!

11:34.693 --> 11:36.655
What?

11:36.695 --> 11:38.739
Your friend doesn't care

11:36.695 --> 11:38.739
about that.

11:38.781 --> 11:42.701
Look at  her  face-- she probably

11:38.781 --> 11:42.701
goes to the same doctor.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.788
(door opens)

11:45.830 --> 11:47.374
Hello, Mother.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.750
Hey, Francis. I thought

11:47.415 --> 11:49.750
you left this morning.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.960
I did.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.753
I got halfway home

11:52.795 --> 11:53.754
when I suddenly

11:53.796 --> 11:54.797
remembered the time

11:54.839 --> 11:56.257
when I was three years old

11:56.299 --> 11:59.010
and you were sick--

11:56.299 --> 11:59.010
or so you said--

11:59.052 --> 12:00.345
and couldn't drive me

12:00.387 --> 12:02.222
to Donnie Dinesco's

12:00.387 --> 12:02.222
birthday party.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.767
So I rode  this  tricycle

12:02.263 --> 12:06.767
two miles in the pouring rain

12:06.809 --> 12:08.144
just to get there.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.188
Lazy? I think not.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.231
Now, I am not leaving

12:11.272 --> 12:13.191
until you apologize.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.193
All you want is an

12:13.233 --> 12:15.193
apology? That's it?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.278
Well, you should've

12:15.235 --> 12:17.278
said so a week ago.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.279
But...

12:18.321 --> 12:20.031
I'm hereby officially sorry.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.451
Okay?

12:20.073 --> 12:23.451
No! Not okay!

12:23.493 --> 12:24.952
That is not an apology.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.788
That's just one of those

12:24.994 --> 12:27.788
cleverly designed apologies

12:27.830 --> 12:30.041
that sounds like an apology

12:27.830 --> 12:30.041
but isn't one.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.793
Now you have to apologize

12:30.083 --> 12:32.793
for apologizing.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.170
And then apologize!

12:34.212 --> 12:35.796
You know what

12:34.212 --> 12:35.796
your problem is?

12:35.838 --> 12:38.091
You know why you can't

12:35.838 --> 12:38.091
accept my apology?

12:38.132 --> 12:41.302
Because you just can't

12:38.132 --> 12:41.302
stand to be happy!

12:41.344 --> 12:42.512
What?!

12:42.554 --> 12:44.013
You have an addiction

12:42.554 --> 12:44.013
to trouble.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.725
You need to have chaos in

12:44.055 --> 12:46.725
your life-- you always have.

12:46.765 --> 12:47.726
I mean, look at you.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.103
You have a great job,

12:50.144 --> 12:53.440
a nice home, a wife,

12:50.144 --> 12:53.440
and you can't stand it.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.815
You have to

12:53.481 --> 12:54.815
come back here

12:54.857 --> 12:56.317
and pick a fight

12:54.857 --> 12:56.317
with your mother.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.527
That's not true.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.861
I came back here because

12:58.903 --> 13:01.030
you've destroyed

12:58.903 --> 13:01.030
any chance any of us

13:01.072 --> 13:02.616
ever had for happiness.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.409
Tell her, Malcolm.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.077
Tell her what a horrible

13:04.451 --> 13:06.077
mother she is.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.828
He's right--

13:06.119 --> 13:07.828
you insinuate yourself

13:07.870 --> 13:09.830
into every part of our lives,

13:07.870 --> 13:09.830
just to make sure

13:09.872 --> 13:11.874
there's no place

13:09.872 --> 13:11.874
we're not miserable.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.042
Well, you're

13:11.916 --> 13:13.042
not gonna

13:13.084 --> 13:14.419
turn me into

13:13.084 --> 13:14.419
a drooling infant

13:14.461 --> 13:15.420
like you did Francis.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.837
Yeah! What?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.757
I'm quitting

13:16.879 --> 13:18.757
the softball team.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.883
You are doing no such thing,

13:18.797 --> 13:20.883
Malcolm.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.886
You had a chance to quit,

13:20.925 --> 13:23.886
but now we have a game.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.472
You made a commitment to a team,

13:25.513 --> 13:27.265
and other people

13:25.513 --> 13:27.265
are counting on you.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.767
You can't force me to play.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.851
No, but I can confiscate

13:28.807 --> 13:30.851
your paychecks.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.854
You're gonna take away money

13:30.893 --> 13:33.854
that's legally mine

13:33.896 --> 13:35.273
for a game of softball?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.942
I don't know. Am I?

13:38.777 --> 13:41.028
You are pure evil.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.282
How do you sleep

13:41.070 --> 13:44.282
at night?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.785
Hal, will you please

13:44.324 --> 13:46.785
talk to the boys?

13:46.825 --> 13:49.120
Not now, Lois, I have

13:46.825 --> 13:49.120
way too much on my mind.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.371
Like what?

13:50.413 --> 13:52.749
I think I'm an

13:50.413 --> 13:52.749
international spy,

13:52.791 --> 13:54.501
and I don't even know

13:52.791 --> 13:54.501
which side I'm on.

13:54.542 --> 13:58.254
I could be a super-villain

13:54.542 --> 13:58.254
and not even know it.

13:58.296 --> 14:01.591
You can just say

13:58.296 --> 14:01.591
you don't want to help me, Hal.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.385
You look very handsome

14:02.759 --> 14:04.385
in your uniform.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.514
I wish you would've let me

14:04.427 --> 14:07.514
take it in around the arms.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.600
Well, good news for you, Lois.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.892
Our right fielder

14:11.934 --> 14:13.394
was screwing around

14:11.934 --> 14:13.394
with a price gun,

14:13.436 --> 14:14.895
took a sticker to the eye.

14:14.937 --> 14:15.896
We're a player short.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.482
We have to forfeit.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.525
Yes!

14:18.983 --> 14:19.900
All right! Amen!

14:19.942 --> 14:20.985
Well, too bad.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.071
Course, the

14:21.027 --> 14:24.071
real losers...

14:24.113 --> 14:26.616
the fans.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.868
Not today, Tonto.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.078
That's just silly.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.789
We're all here,

14:31.120 --> 14:32.789
we're all in uniform,

14:32.831 --> 14:33.914
everyone wants to play.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.125
Malcolm, go be

14:33.956 --> 14:36.125
on Mel's team.

14:36.167 --> 14:36.917
What?

14:36.959 --> 14:38.336
Oh, yeah, big favor.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.796
No, no, no, no,

14:38.378 --> 14:39.796
no, his game

14:39.838 --> 14:41.214
has really improved.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.214
Hasn't it, honey?

14:41.255 --> 14:44.091
After all that stuff about

14:41.255 --> 14:44.091
my commitment to this team,

14:44.133 --> 14:46.177
you could just decide

14:44.133 --> 14:46.177
to give me away?

14:46.219 --> 14:49.514
Malcolm, everybody's nervous

14:46.219 --> 14:49.514
about making new friends.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.851
Just be yourself.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.851
They'll like you fine.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.940
I'm gonna hit this ball

14:57.438 --> 14:59.940
so far out of the park,

14:59.982 --> 15:01.568
my mom's gonna wish she never...

15:01.609 --> 15:03.778
Wait, what do I do

15:01.609 --> 15:03.778
with my hips again?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.488
Strike one!

15:03.820 --> 15:05.488
What?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.032
Okay, it'll be okay.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.950
Just stop thinking.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.911
You can do it, honey.

15:12.829 --> 15:13.954
Strike two!

15:13.996 --> 15:15.790
Look, just don't talk

15:13.996 --> 15:15.790
to me, okay?!

15:15.832 --> 15:17.751
Just pitch the ball!

15:17.792 --> 15:19.001
I can't believe

15:17.792 --> 15:19.001
she's doing this.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.961
I just hate it

15:19.043 --> 15:20.961
when she treats me like this

15:21.003 --> 15:22.171
in front of everyone.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.171
It's so...

15:22.213 --> 15:24.173
Strike three!

15:26.885 --> 15:28.595
(cell phone ringing)

15:26.885 --> 15:28.595
FRANCIS:  Hello?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.054
No, honey bun, I'm still here.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.181
I have a few more things

15:30.096 --> 15:32.181
to straighten out

15:32.223 --> 15:33.974
before I can leave,

15:32.223 --> 15:33.974
but I promise

15:34.016 --> 15:35.976
that we will celebrate

15:34.016 --> 15:35.976
our anniversary

15:36.018 --> 15:38.062
as soon as I get home.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.147
Right, if you're still there.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.066
(knocking)

15:42.108 --> 15:44.277
Did Reese and Dewey

15:42.108 --> 15:44.277
leave yet?

15:44.318 --> 15:46.279
Leave for where?

15:44.318 --> 15:46.279
Kopelman's junkyard.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.406
Reese is going to break

15:46.320 --> 15:48.406
the toilet seat record.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.156
He's what?!

15:49.198 --> 15:50.283
I still have one

15:50.324 --> 15:51.826
you autographed

15:50.324 --> 15:51.826
for my brother.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.953
It'll probably drop

15:51.868 --> 15:53.953
in value after this.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.915
Just tell them

15:55.121 --> 15:56.915
you don't want the job.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.250
Don't think about

15:56.956 --> 15:59.250
what they can do to you.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.420
Just... tell them!

16:15.266 --> 16:18.018
Uh, thank you

16:15.266 --> 16:18.018
for considering me.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.021
It's very flattering.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.942
But I've decided

16:21.063 --> 16:23.942
to stay where I am for now.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.862
If things change,

16:23.983 --> 16:27.862
I'll let you know.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.625
(dogs growling viciously)

16:40.667 --> 16:42.042
Where is he?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.461
Looks like the pit bulls

16:43.503 --> 16:45.212
are herding him

16:43.503 --> 16:45.212
toward the Dobermans.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.548
It's beautiful, really,

16:45.254 --> 16:47.548
the way they work together.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.008
(Reese yelling)

16:50.677 --> 16:52.720
(screams)

16:52.762 --> 16:55.682
Did I make it?

16:52.762 --> 16:55.682
Am I alive?

16:57.183 --> 17:00.060
Why do I have bacon

16:57.183 --> 17:00.060
in my pocket?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.146
Reese, damn it,

17:00.102 --> 17:02.146
you crazy idiot!

17:02.188 --> 17:03.898
Do you know what you are?

17:04.273 --> 17:06.025
You're me!

17:07.109 --> 17:08.736
Mom was right--

17:07.109 --> 17:08.736
we do love trouble.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.781
That's why we do stupid,

17:08.778 --> 17:11.781
moronic things like this.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.073
What are you talking about?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.116
I'm gonna be famous.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.869
This isn't about fame.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.329
It's about putting yourself

17:15.910 --> 17:18.329
in danger for no reason.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.707
It's an addiction

17:18.371 --> 17:20.707
to pain and suffering.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.709
And you know what?

17:20.748 --> 17:22.709
I'm done with it.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.919
And you should be, too,

17:22.750 --> 17:24.919
'cause it isn't worth it.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.086
That's easy for you to say.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.964
You've already had the glory.

17:28.006 --> 17:32.010
Glory? You think this stupid,

17:28.006 --> 17:32.010
dangerous stunt gave me glory?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.261
I'll show you what it gave me.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.097
(boys groaning)

17:37.139 --> 17:39.266
Horrible, isn't it?

17:39.308 --> 17:42.061
Only the middle one's

17:39.308 --> 17:42.061
functional.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.026
I can go now.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.194
I've been set free.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.780
Good-bye and good luck.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.407
BOY:

17:52.822 --> 17:54.407
11, 12...

17:54.448 --> 17:55.575
He got 12!

17:55.616 --> 17:57.117
Reese broke the record!

17:57.159 --> 17:58.828
(boys cheering)

17:58.870 --> 18:00.120
It doesn't matter!

18:00.162 --> 18:03.082
Didn't you people

18:00.162 --> 18:03.082
hear a word I said?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.044
Are you sure he got...

18:06.085 --> 18:07.294
What's the difference?

18:07.336 --> 18:08.713
That's not the point!

18:08.755 --> 18:11.173
What I'm trying to say is...

18:11.966 --> 18:14.802
(groans)

18:17.096 --> 18:18.222
Give me the bacon.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.141
I don't want an asterisk

18:18.264 --> 18:21.141
by my record.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.312
Kid, please,

18:23.185 --> 18:25.312
it's the last inning,

18:25.354 --> 18:28.148
you struck out four times,

18:25.354 --> 18:28.148
dropped six fly balls,

18:28.190 --> 18:31.360
somehow elbowed

18:28.190 --> 18:31.360
yourself in the groin.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.864
The good news is, I think

18:31.402 --> 18:34.864
we're all laughed out.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.450
Just get up there, close

18:34.906 --> 18:37.450
your eyes and swing.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.326
It's because she keeps...

18:39.368 --> 18:41.203
looking at me, on purpose!

18:41.245 --> 18:44.164
She has to be taught

18:41.245 --> 18:44.164
a lesson.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.043
Hey. Your team's

18:44.206 --> 18:47.043
down 16 to one.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.544
Want to get out of here?

18:48.586 --> 18:51.171
Oh, she would just love it

18:48.586 --> 18:51.171
if I did that, wouldn't she?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.173
Well, I'm not gonna give her

18:51.213 --> 18:53.173
the satisfaction.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.175
She's gonna learn

18:53.215 --> 18:55.175
that she can't control me.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.386
You know what, Malcolm,

18:55.217 --> 18:57.386
I don't date guys who are

18:57.428 --> 18:58.679
involved with other women.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.180
Especially when

18:58.721 --> 19:00.180
it's their mother.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.724
Good-bye.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.149
Okay, this is your last chance.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.695
(cell phone ringing)

19:14.737 --> 19:16.196
Hello?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.699
Sure, I got time

19:16.238 --> 19:18.699
to take a survey.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.618
Disagree.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.377
(cheering)

19:30.419 --> 19:32.212
I did it! I hit the ball!

19:32.254 --> 19:34.507
I can't...

19:35.341 --> 19:37.217
Finally! This will show her!

19:37.259 --> 19:38.552
It has to!

19:48.270 --> 19:49.438
Oh, man.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.482
I don't care, I'm going for it.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.116
I'll bet she planned

19:58.489 --> 20:00.116
the whole thing

20:00.158 --> 20:01.241
so it would end up like this.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.952
Now the only way I can score

20:02.994 --> 20:05.454
is if I'm willing to cleat

20:02.994 --> 20:05.454
my own mother in the face.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.249
I can't do it.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.212
What do you know?

20:18.300 --> 20:19.468
He's out!

20:20.553 --> 20:23.263
Honey, if you're

20:20.553 --> 20:23.263
gonna cleat someone,

20:23.305 --> 20:26.350
you have to remember

20:23.305 --> 20:26.350
to lead with your heel.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.935
(whimpers)

20:27.977 --> 20:29.269
FRANCIS:

20:27.977 --> 20:29.269
Didn't you hear me, Piama?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.355
I got 14 toilet seats.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.107
I have the record again.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.318
You know, Mom said this

20:33.149 --> 20:36.318
is exactly how you'd react.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.571
So, I was reading this

20:36.360 --> 20:38.571
really interesting story

20:38.612 --> 20:40.573
about glass eaters...

20:40.614 --> 20:42.200
Nah, you don't want

20:40.614 --> 20:42.200
to hear this.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.784
Dewey, when are

20:42.241 --> 20:43.784
you gonna learn

20:43.826 --> 20:46.286
that I'm the guy who makes

20:43.826 --> 20:46.286
the decisions around here?

20:46.328 --> 20:48.081
Go on.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.081
Well, apparently

20:46.328 --> 20:48.081
the trick is...

20:48.122 --> 20:52.126
Well, that was a pretty shameful

20:48.122 --> 20:52.126
display this afternoon.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.212
Look, I-I was...

20:52.168 --> 20:54.212
It's all right.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.462
I'm not gonna ask you

20:55.504 --> 20:57.506
why you've been behaving

20:55.504 --> 20:57.506
like this lately,

20:57.548 --> 21:00.300
because I think I know.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.762
You're jealous

21:00.342 --> 21:02.762
of the new baby.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.139
And you're right--

21:02.803 --> 21:05.139
I haven't been

21:05.181 --> 21:06.974
giving you enough

21:05.181 --> 21:06.974
attention lately.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.601
But don't worry.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.478
Tomorrow we're gonna go out,

21:08.642 --> 21:11.478
we're gonna get you a haircut

21:11.520 --> 21:13.189
and some new undershirts,

21:13.231 --> 21:15.274
just the two of us, okay?

Thanks, Mom.
