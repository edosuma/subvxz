HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.934
WHY DO I HAVE
TO WRITE IT DOWN?

03:28.934 --> 03:30.767
BECAUSE IT'S JUST
THE SPIRIT OF

03:30.767 --> 03:31.767
IT'S ABOUT THIS PLACE.

03:31.767 --> 03:33.700

04:22.834 --> 04:24.467
IF SHE CHEATS HERSELF
OUT OF GOING BECAUSE OF ME,

HOW DO I LIVE WITH THAT?

04:26.367 --> 04:28.867
BUT YOU DON'T
WANT HER TO GO.

HAVE TO DO IT.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
I'LL JUST
GIVE YOU AN "A"

SO YOU WERE
JUST PRETENDING.
