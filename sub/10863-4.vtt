13:29.480 --> 13:30.640
I'm calling the cops.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.960
Wait! Jake's
your brother!

13:31.960 --> 13:33.120
What is with you?

13:33.120 --> 13:36.880
Look, I don't have
any brother, OK?

13:36.880 --> 13:38.280
Now get outta here!

13:39.280 --> 13:40.520
You're not kidding,
are you?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.680
No, I'm not kidding!
I'll bean you!

13:42.680 --> 13:44.480
Hey!

13:44.480 --> 13:46.400
I'll prove it
to you...

13:49.440 --> 13:51.840
This is Jake's
bed... room.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.720
Are you gonna get out,
or do I call the cops?

13:55.720 --> 13:58.720
The cops. Yeah. You told us a
story about the Phone Police

13:58.720 --> 14:01.320
and a kid named
Billy Baxter.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.640
You know the story?

14:02.640 --> 14:03.760
Yeah, I know it.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.640
Except the way
I heard it,

14:05.640 --> 14:07.640
they got a kid
named O'Brian,

14:07.640 --> 14:09.040
a Jake O'Brian.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.360
Jake O'Brian?

14:11.360 --> 14:13.160
No! Let me go!

14:13.160 --> 14:14.640
Lemme go!

14:14.640 --> 14:16.160
I didn't do anything.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.160
I swear it was
just a joke!

14:18.160 --> 14:19.840
Nobody got hurt!

14:37.480 --> 14:40.000
Oh, man!
Those guys work fast.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.720

It's me.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.080
Chris! Get me outta here,
man! This place is nuts.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.800
I didn't do anything
wrong! You gotta help me!

15:01.800 --> 15:03.800
Whoa! Calm down.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.800
Get Annie!
Get my parents!

15:05.800 --> 15:07.600
Uh...I can't
do that, Jake.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
Why not?
You gotta do something,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.760
or I'll be
stuck here forever.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.520
This whole thing is
weirder than you even know.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.840
I'm scared, Chris.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.080
Me, too.
But I got a plan.

15:20.080 --> 15:23.080
Maybe we can beat the phone
police at their own game.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.080

We got it!

19:02.960 --> 19:04.440
We're outta here.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.840
OK. Listen.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.840
I gotta tell you
something.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.360
After you got
caught,

20:42.360 --> 20:45.000
I went to your
house, and--aah!

20:57.920 --> 20:59.840
What's wrong
with you guys?

20:59.840 --> 21:02.200
This is Jake,
Annie, your brother.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.760
You gotta
remember him now.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.360
Where do you get these
friends from, Jake.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.520
Do you, uh, order them
from the back of comics?

21:09.520 --> 21:12.560
You remember him?
You know who he is?

21:12.560 --> 21:15.680
Yeah. In fact, I'd like
to forget him if I could.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.600
I don't believe this.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.320
Jake, your room's
back to normal.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.120
Annie, don't! It's
the Phone Police.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.440
Phone Police? Airhead,
I made that up.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.360
But it's true!
They got me.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.400
Yeah, I wish. Ha.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.080
Pizza.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.320
One jumbo, extra cheese, all
dressed, hold the anchovies.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.520

order a pizza?

21:54.960 --> 21:56.360
Oh, jeez, sorry.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.800
Night.

22:05.400 --> 22:09.320
I can't believe you guys bought
that story about the Phone Police.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.600
Talk about gullible.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.320
I'm gonna lie down.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.360
I'm exhausted.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.080

didn't it?

Jake and Chris never made
another crank call

22:59.760 --> 23:01.280
'cause they were
never sure

23:01.280 --> 23:03.680
if the Phone Police
were really real,

23:03.680 --> 23:06.680
or if they could
believe anything else

23:06.680 --> 23:09.080
they ever saw... again.
