00:12.213 --> 00:13.513
Talk to me, Scholls.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.383
It's a real mess.
Dead bodies everywhere.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.884
Oh, my God.
What happened?

00:17.885 --> 00:19.345
High-end sedan
slammed into a truck

00:19.353 --> 00:21.323
delivering cadavers
to the medical school.

00:21.324 --> 00:22.791
The latch on the door broke.

00:22.792 --> 00:24.190
Bodies never stood a chance.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.861
Anyone <i> not</i> dead
at the time of the crash?

00:25.862 --> 00:28.330
The driver of the sedan
fled the scene on foot.

00:28.331 --> 00:30.059
The truck driver's
extremely critical.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.502
You're making the straps
too tight.

00:31.503 --> 00:33.299
And why didn't you
take my shoes off first?

00:33.300 --> 00:34.400
You should know this.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.732
Excuse me, sir...
L.A.P.D.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.536
Do you remember anything
from your accident?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.138
Yeah, I was driving my truck,

00:39.140 --> 00:42.208
and then some lunatic
in a fancy-shmancy car

00:42.209 --> 00:44.579
runs a stop sign
and plows right into me.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.878
Hey, how long until
you put my leg bone back in?

00:46.881 --> 00:48.911
What is it gonna take
for you to get this right?

00:48.916 --> 00:50.676
I got it.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.823
Any chance you got a look
at the driver?

00:53.824 --> 00:57.491
Yeah. He looked exactly like
the inside of an airbag!

00:58.192 --> 01:00.232
Use your head.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.755
Let's get back to the precinct,
run the plates.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.034
Nothing more despicable
than a hit-and-run.

01:06.035 --> 01:07.502
You can't punch me!
I'm dead!

01:07.503 --> 01:08.931
If I were alive,
I'd beat you up!

01:15.176 --> 01:17.736
<i># Angie Tribeca #</i>

01:22.249 --> 01:23.616
How bad is it?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.217
I like the sweater,
but the slicked-back hair

01:25.219 --> 01:27.349
comes across as hostile.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.424
We got a hit-and-run...
Unknown perp.

01:29.425 --> 01:31.123
The victim's name
is Kurt Piedmont.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.285
Broken back, broken legs,
broken heart.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.128
His wife left him
for his brother.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.629
How do we find the scumbag
that hit him?

01:36.630 --> 01:39.230
We ran the plates and realized
the car didn't have any.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.701
Between that
and the new-car smell,

01:40.702 --> 01:42.701
we're thinking maybe it was
a test-drive gone wrong.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.903
Also, I got Forensics
looking for prints.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.205
Good work.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.737
That reminds me, Geils...
Your application

01:47.741 --> 01:49.911
for the lieutenants program
was approved.

01:49.912 --> 01:50.910
Congrats.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.241
And, Tribeca...

01:52.246 --> 01:55.146
you won a beach towel
in the department raffle.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.879
Way to go.
I'm proud of you.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.645
Thank you, sir.

02:01.055 --> 02:02.585
I was gonna tell you.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.620
Uh-huh.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.593
I'm not even sure
I'm gonna do it.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.133
It's fine.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.062
Okay.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.998
Doesn't <i> sound</i> fine.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.169
It's totally fine.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.467
All right.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.268
It's just, you know,
I'm looking down the road,

02:16.270 --> 02:18.100
and I'm thinking
about our future.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.670
I don't... You know,
<i>the</i> future,<i> our</i> future.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.676
Mm-hmm.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.677
The...

02:26.347 --> 02:29.077
<i>- Hi. Welcome to Planet Taco.
- May I take your order?</i>

02:29.083 --> 02:30.450
Uh-huh.

02:30.451 --> 02:34.151
<i>Are you sure?
Because you sound weird.</i>

02:34.155 --> 02:38.155
¶¶

02:38.159 --> 02:39.789
Hi, there!

02:39.793 --> 02:41.493
My name's Docto...

02:41.495 --> 02:44.195
Geils. Tribeca.
How lovely to see you.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.528
How's it going, Doctor?

02:45.533 --> 02:46.873
Well, it'd be going a lot better

02:46.874 --> 02:49.367
if I could get you
into a new car today.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.438
A car from this lot was involved
in a hit-and-run this morning.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.773
It didn't have any registration,

02:53.774 --> 02:55.644
so we're thinking
maybe it was a test-drive?

02:55.645 --> 02:57.713
You send out any cars
that didn't come back?

02:57.714 --> 02:58.978
Maybe.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.879
Yeah, "maybe" is about
all I can do right now.

03:00.881 --> 03:04.221
Yeah, we were really hoping
for a "Yes" or "No."

03:05.352 --> 03:07.287
Let me talk to my manager.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.548
This is how they keep you here.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.156
I know.
It's ridiculous.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.718
I wonder if they make this
in a hatchback.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.826
What, for all
your lieutenant gear?

03:15.829 --> 03:17.829
You said
it wasn't bothering you.
It's not.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.831
I have ambition. Is that
an issue for you or something?

03:19.833 --> 03:21.833
Just drop it, okay?
You're the one
who brought it up.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.035
Okay, well,
here's what we can do.

03:24.038 --> 03:27.907
Maybe someone did come in today
for a test-drive

03:27.908 --> 03:29.468
and didn't return the car.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.806
Let's go.
Thank you.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.411
All right, all right.
Hang on, hang on.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.813
Might have been a male,
possibly a student.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.576
But the sales associate
didn't get a license.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.745
We're gonna need
a little more than that.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.721
Oh, I like you two.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.763
Let me talk to my manager.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.526
Give me $500
on the Saskatchewan Roughriders,

03:51.532 --> 03:52.932
minus 7 over Montreal,

03:52.933 --> 03:54.533
and $300
on Johnny from Cobra Kai

03:54.535 --> 03:56.765
to beat Daniel Larusso.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.270
Well, can you spot me?

03:58.272 --> 04:00.672
Todd, I need this... money.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.209
Everything okay?

04:03.210 --> 04:04.880
Just on the phone
with the DNA lab.

04:04.881 --> 04:06.446
Mm.

04:06.447 --> 04:10.247
Look, I know your breakup
with Geils has been hard.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.421
Believe me, I've been there.

04:11.422 --> 04:13.218
You broke up with Geils?
Yeah.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.750
Except my Geils' name
was Loretta.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.416
And I know you're hurting,

04:17.423 --> 04:19.293
but this whole gambling thing
that you're doing,

04:19.295 --> 04:21.293
this is...
This is a dark road.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.625
Take it from me.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.460
You had
a gambling problem?
Yeah.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.425
Except my gambling problem
was named Mint Chocolate Chip.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.974
Binge-eating?
No... stripper from downtown.

04:29.975 --> 04:31.070
Mm.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.641
But if you need help
with anything

04:32.642 --> 04:36.540
or just want to talk,
know that I'm here for you.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.878
Thanks, Tanner. You're actually
the first person...

04:38.879 --> 04:40.309
Now, were you able
to lift any prints

04:40.314 --> 04:42.154
off the hit-and-run
vehicle?

04:43.550 --> 04:45.420
Let's just go
to another dealership.

04:45.421 --> 04:47.249
We've already been here
two hours.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.494
You want to start over?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.392
Hey, Tanner.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.494
We got a match on the prints.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.126
Okay. Thanks.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.671
You're not gonna like this,
but the driver of the car

04:59.672 --> 05:02.767
was a USWC star athlete
named Aaron McLaren.

05:02.770 --> 05:06.000
Aaron McLaren?
USWC's star athlete?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.606
Good news.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.008
My manager has authorized me...
And he never does this...

05:10.010 --> 05:12.310
To tell you that the driver's
first name is Aaron.

05:19.286 --> 05:22.246
Where do we find Aaron McLaren?

05:22.256 --> 05:23.856
Who wants to know?

05:23.857 --> 05:24.957
L.A.P.D.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.388
Haven't seen him.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.662
How 'bout now?

05:31.598 --> 05:33.128
Unh-unh!

05:33.133 --> 05:34.673
He's out on the court.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.099
Animals.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.684
There he is.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.045
Mr. McLaren?

05:50.050 --> 05:52.780
Sorry. I don't do autographs
until after practice.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.016
We're with the L.A.P.D.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.221
We have a couple of questions

05:55.222 --> 05:56.862
about the incident this morning.

05:56.863 --> 05:58.217
I don't own a car.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.515
We never mentioned a car,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.386
but it did happen to be
about a car accident.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.025
I told you...
I don't own a car.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.661
I just said it too early.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.696
Excuse me.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.631
Arnold Waifer.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.295
I'm the athletic director here.

06:10.304 --> 06:11.704
This is a private practice.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.039
We're just talking
to Mr. McLaren

06:13.040 --> 06:14.470
about a car accident
this morning.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.865
He has nothing to say to you.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.676
If you have any questions
for this student,

06:17.678 --> 06:20.148
you may direct them
to the office of the dean,

06:20.149 --> 06:21.547
along with your transcripts,

06:21.548 --> 06:24.478
SAT scores,
and any extracurriculars.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.485
You broke a man in half,
McLaren.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.987
Cost him his livelihood.

06:27.988 --> 06:28.988
That's enough.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.189
You test-drove a car,

06:30.190 --> 06:31.490
and you plowed it
into his truck.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.192
Okay, that's it!
Two laps, both of you!

06:34.194 --> 06:35.994
Tribeca!

06:35.996 --> 06:38.196
We'll be back, McLaren...

06:38.198 --> 06:39.768
Next time, with a warrant.

06:39.769 --> 06:41.567
Good luck with that.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.613
All right, Wiedner,
what do you got for me?

06:54.615 --> 06:57.115
Well, it's been a crazy week.
My brother's in town...

06:57.117 --> 06:58.577
Brother story's a dead end.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.415
I want to hear more
about your mom's mammogram.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.021
Okay. Get this.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.122
So, she's standing there
with her top off, and the doc...

07:06.527 --> 07:07.757
Sorry, Wiedner.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.131
Sometimes
it's a little hard for me

07:09.132 --> 07:10.929
to leave my job at the office.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.761
Atkins.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.196
You kidding me?

07:14.201 --> 07:16.031
All right,
I'll tell the D.A.,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.796
but she's not gonna like it.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.972
Tell me what?

07:19.973 --> 07:22.973
We have a suspect
in the USWC hit-and-run.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.481
Give it to me.
What do you got?

07:29.483 --> 07:31.321
Melanie Burke,
district attorney.

07:31.322 --> 07:32.918
Hi, I'm Beth Wiedn...
I know.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.387
So, hit-and-run.

07:34.388 --> 07:35.888
It might be a tough prosecution.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.289
Nonsense.
We'll bury him...

07:37.291 --> 07:38.621
Have his whole family
testify against him,

07:38.625 --> 07:40.055
plant little stories
in the news.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.560
He'll never see the sun again.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.062
I think you should take into
consideration, Melanie,

07:43.063 --> 07:45.963
that the perpetrator is...
Aaron McLaren.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.234
No way.
He's untouchable.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.896
Drop the case.
Just drop the charges.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.304
Shred everything you have
on the case.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.806
This conversation
never happened.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.907
There's a man in the hospital
who may lose a leg!

07:55.909 --> 07:59.078
So? Give him a dog's leg.
Boom! Good as new!

07:59.079 --> 08:02.179
Think I want to go up
against a badminton player...

08:02.182 --> 08:03.516
In Los Angeles?

08:03.517 --> 08:06.077
Oh, Jesus.
No, thanks.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.588
Now, who wants
to take this party upstairs

08:10.591 --> 08:12.721
to my fourth-floor condo?

08:14.127 --> 08:16.757
Please tell me
we're going after this guy.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.931
It's not that simple, Tribeca.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.302
We're talking about
a college athlete...

08:21.303 --> 08:23.639
King of the mountain,
top of the food chain,

08:23.640 --> 08:25.167
the Bey to our Beyhive.

08:25.172 --> 08:29.609
Okay, he may be gifted, virile,
articulate, charismatic,

08:29.610 --> 08:31.140
and, without a doubt,
destined for greatness,

08:31.144 --> 08:33.313
but he committed a crime,
and last time I checked,

08:33.315 --> 08:34.783
that's against the law.

08:35.849 --> 08:36.779
She's right.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.222
All right!
Bring him in!

08:38.224 --> 08:39.448
Sic Tanner on him.

08:39.453 --> 08:42.321
But for Pete's sake,
keep this quiet!

08:43.357 --> 08:44.657
I'm sorry, Pete.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.758
Colic.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.526
Mr. McLaren, you're
in a lot of trouble, brother.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.036
Mr. McLaren,
are you there?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.967
<i>Aaron McLaren is everywhere.
Wassup?</i>

08:58.972 --> 09:00.806
Why the hell
couldn't we just bring him in?

09:00.807 --> 09:02.567
The lieutenant thought
once it got into the press,

09:02.576 --> 09:04.036
we'd lose the public.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.084
Love him or hate him,
this is badminton country.

09:06.085 --> 09:08.909
Mr. McLaren, can you <i> please</i>
turn down the music?

09:08.916 --> 09:11.316
<i>Sorry. No can do.
I'm taking a chemistry test.</i>

09:11.318 --> 09:13.348
<i>Yo, anyone know what H2SO4 is?</i>

09:13.353 --> 09:14.753
<i>Sulfuric acid!</i>

09:14.755 --> 09:17.485
<i>Ha! Thanks, baby!
I'll see you at the game!</i>

09:17.491 --> 09:19.991
Mr. McLaren,
we're giving you one last chance

09:19.993 --> 09:20.993
to come clean here.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.034
You know,
maybe it was an accident.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.430
Accidents happen.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.261
Just admit what you did, and...

09:26.266 --> 09:29.066
And we'll talk to the D.A.
about taking it easy on you.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.769
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

09:30.771 --> 09:33.041
<i>I didn't test-drive a car.
I didn't slam into a truck.</i>

09:33.042 --> 09:34.840
<i>Look, I'm sorry
that guy lost his leg...</i>

09:34.841 --> 09:36.611
<i>Seemed like a really nice guy...</i>

09:36.612 --> 09:38.740
<i>But I wasn't in any accident.</i>

09:38.745 --> 09:40.375
Now you listen to me, Aaron!

09:41.615 --> 09:42.905
<i>Take it easy!</i>

09:42.916 --> 09:44.776
We got your fingerprints
all over that car!

09:44.785 --> 09:47.045
We even got the car dealership
where you did the test-drive.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.754
Now, you start
talking to me right now,

09:48.755 --> 09:51.185
or you're gonna make me
very, very mad!

09:51.191 --> 09:52.558
<i>Aah!</i>

09:54.027 --> 09:55.527
<i>Damn!</i>

09:55.529 --> 09:57.359
<i>I got a game tomorrow night.</i>

10:01.535 --> 10:03.225
Look, Aaron, I get it.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.866
I was a college athlete...

10:04.871 --> 10:08.471
Cock of the walk, BMOC, LGBTQ.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.765
You get all jacked up,

10:09.776 --> 10:11.606
and maybe you did
something you regret.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.812
Maybe you choked out
the school mascot

10:13.814 --> 10:15.583
in a drunken rage but denied it

10:15.584 --> 10:18.722
'cause you wanted to go into
a career in law enforcement.

10:18.723 --> 10:21.719
But eventually,
there comes a time, Aaron,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.622
where you got to put ego
aside and...

10:23.624 --> 10:25.924
<i>I'll</i> never <i> put my ego aside.</i>

10:27.160 --> 10:28.460
<i>Aaron McLaren...</i>

10:28.462 --> 10:30.502
<i>has left the conference.</i>

10:30.503 --> 10:31.957
We have a problem.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.173
He's not pressing charges.

10:34.174 --> 10:35.297
What?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.902
Mr. Piedmont,
the truck driver?

10:36.903 --> 10:38.938
He's not pressing charges.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.678
Oh. Dr. Scholls.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.651
I didn't realize you were...

10:51.652 --> 10:52.818
crazy.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.789
Oh, no, I'm fine.
My brother died.

10:54.790 --> 10:56.518
I <i> was</i> sad, but now I'm happy.

10:56.523 --> 10:59.361
- See you next Wednesday, Monica.
- And no gambling.

10:59.362 --> 11:01.859
Call your brother
if you need support.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.507
Tribeca.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.138
You sure
you're in the right place?

11:16.143 --> 11:17.643
I know, Dr. Moreau.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.979
I'm sorry I called you a quack
at the picnic.

11:19.980 --> 11:20.980
No.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.181
Something on your mind?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.549
I guess.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.950
I'm not really comfortable
talking about...

11:25.952 --> 11:27.652
inside stuff.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.854
I can't tell you the number
of times I've heard that.

11:29.856 --> 11:30.956
Why not?

11:30.957 --> 11:31.817
How's work?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.655
I mean, it's basically good.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.490
I still enjoy
roughing up bad guys,

11:35.495 --> 11:37.055
putting them behind bars
for life.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.364
And it's not even my job

11:38.365 --> 11:39.695
to decide
whether or not they did it.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.830
No, I mean your <i> real</i> work...
At home.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.325
Well, that's where
it gets a little tricky.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.636
Let me guess.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.668
You're finally
in a committed relationship

11:46.673 --> 11:48.673
where you know
you <i> should</i> feel comfortable,

11:48.675 --> 11:50.335
so why is it that you're feeling

11:50.343 --> 11:52.043
completely uncomfortable?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.184
Maybe because
the closer you get with Geils,

11:59.186 --> 12:02.546
the more you're realizing
how many things separate you,

12:02.556 --> 12:04.086
and how can two people
be right for each other

12:04.091 --> 12:06.861
when they want totally different
things out of life?

12:11.865 --> 12:14.865
And maybe Geils applying
for the lieutenants program

12:14.868 --> 12:17.336
just shines
a big, giant spotlight

12:17.337 --> 12:19.767
on exactly this problem.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.179
I know you mean well, Doc,

12:30.183 --> 12:32.952
and don't take this
the wrong way, but...

12:32.953 --> 12:35.221
I think
your profession's a joke.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.388
Well, it was worth a shot.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.557
I have
some antidepressant samples.

12:37.558 --> 12:38.557
That'd be great!

12:47.567 --> 12:49.067
How you feeling,
Mr. Piedmont?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.399
Good. So much better.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.039
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

12:54.040 --> 12:56.070
We didn't catch you
at a bad time, did we?

12:56.076 --> 12:57.136
No.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.310
No, not at all.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.941
No, I feel very well.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.613
Figure I'll be out of here
in a day or...

13:01.615 --> 13:03.545
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

13:03.550 --> 13:04.780
We heard you changed your mind

13:04.785 --> 13:07.145
about pressing charges
against Aaron McLaren.

13:07.988 --> 13:11.388
I've got a 3-D television
for a Mr. "Guy I Hit"?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.991
Oh. Yeah,
you can put it over there.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.758
Thanks.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.596
I may be way out of line here,

13:21.601 --> 13:24.937
but is there any chance
Mr. McLaren,

13:24.938 --> 13:26.638
or maybe even the university,

13:26.640 --> 13:28.470
talked to you
about dropping the charges?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.275
No. I just...

13:30.277 --> 13:32.277
I figured, boys will be boys.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.409
He made a mistake.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.413
No harm, no f...

13:35.415 --> 13:40.115
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

13:41.655 --> 13:43.145
That's complete B.S.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.686
The school obviously got to him.

13:44.691 --> 13:45.960
What are we supposed to do?

13:45.961 --> 13:48.289
Without a victim,
there's no crime.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.555
Tribeca?

13:51.464 --> 13:52.634
Should we give her
a minute, or...?

13:52.635 --> 13:53.799
She usually...

13:53.800 --> 13:55.768
Fleeing the scene.
What do you mean?

13:55.769 --> 13:57.269
We charge him
with fleeing the scene.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.970
I know it's small, but maybe
it shakes something loose

13:58.972 --> 14:00.472
and the whole thing
falls into place.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.013
We're treading
on very thin ice here.

14:02.014 --> 14:05.808
There's two seasons in L.A...
Summer and badminton.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.882
I'm gonna have to answer
to the mayor,

14:07.883 --> 14:09.811
the president
of the university...

14:09.816 --> 14:12.016
Maybe this is one
we just let go.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.386
Oh, is that right, Lieutenant?

14:14.387 --> 14:15.487
Hey, that's not fair.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.988
You're not even behind a desk,

14:16.990 --> 14:19.058
and already, you're concerned
about your track record?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.889
Lieutenant, how are you
not calling her on this?

14:20.894 --> 14:22.194
You can challenge,
but if you're wrong,

14:22.195 --> 14:23.655
it's gonna cost you
a time-out.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.303
Geils, you going out
for Lieutenant?

14:25.304 --> 14:26.998
Congratulations, man!

14:27.000 --> 14:28.968
That's great!
Not now.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.139
I'm just saying,
you'll make a great lieutenant.

14:31.140 --> 14:33.537
Me? I'm a cop
for the streets.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.240
You know what
I'm talkin' about, right?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.379
What's it gonna be,
Real Lieutenant?

14:38.380 --> 14:39.638
You gonna play it safe

14:39.646 --> 14:41.006
or are you gonna go after
the bad guy,

14:41.014 --> 14:42.984
like it says
on the mural we painted?

14:43.850 --> 14:45.850
The D.A. is
gonna have my ass.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.552
You want to dance?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.154
Let's dance.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.026
Though we're only 17 years in,

14:54.027 --> 14:55.887
they're already calling it
the trial of the century.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.326
The City of Los Angeles
vs. Aaron McLaren

14:58.331 --> 14:59.700
is sending shock waves

14:59.701 --> 15:01.899
through this sleepy
Southern California town.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.702
Oh, I am just getting word now

15:03.703 --> 15:05.741
that Aaron McLaren is pulling up
to the courthouse.

15:05.742 --> 15:07.239
Let me see
if I can get a word with him.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.909
Mr. McLaren. How are you feeling
about the trial today?

15:09.910 --> 15:11.580
We knew they were
gonna come out and hit us

15:11.581 --> 15:12.908
with everything they got,

15:12.913 --> 15:14.580
but we're gonna stick
to the game plan,

15:14.581 --> 15:16.081
focus on the fundamentals,
and hopefully...

15:16.082 --> 15:17.722
God willing...
We'll come out with a W.

15:17.723 --> 15:19.247
Thank you.
Thank you, Aaron.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.190
I am now being joined
by Detective Angie Tribeca,

15:22.191 --> 15:25.688
who was instrumental in bringing
the charges against Aaron.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.592
Detective Tribeca, first of all,

15:27.594 --> 15:28.894
let me say, you look beautiful.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.695
Thank you so much.
It's so fun to be here.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.427
How are you feeling
about your chances?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.067
It's a real honor to work
for the criminal justice system

15:35.068 --> 15:36.798
and really just looking
to have a good time.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.443
I love you, Tribeca!

15:38.444 --> 15:39.898
Love you, too!

15:39.906 --> 15:42.406
All right, but you have to
step up to the glam cam.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.580
So, there's a lot
riding on this case for...

15:48.581 --> 15:50.451
All right, guys,
have a great trial.

15:50.452 --> 15:52.120
Thank you.
Thanks, everyone.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.130
Great seats, Tanner.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.332
Yeah, my cousin,
he's the bailiff.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.108
Oh, man.
Look at McLaren.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.480
They completely
cleaned him up for court.

16:19.481 --> 16:20.979
He's a good kid.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.649
Works hard, donates to charity,

16:23.650 --> 16:25.780
volunteers
at an investment bank.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.585
You remember what it's like
to be young.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.247
I played football.
I don't remember a thing.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.856
All rise.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.628
This is the City of Los Angeles
vs. Aaron McLaren.

16:34.629 --> 16:36.287
The Honorable Judge Gruff
presiding.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.596
You may be seated.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.667
Don't worry.
We got this.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.899
Gruff hates lawbreakers.

16:46.139 --> 16:49.239
Mr. McLaren, please stand up
and face the court.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.512
You have been charged with
fleeing the scene of a crime.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.083
How do you plead?

16:55.815 --> 16:57.445
Not guilty, Your Honor.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.017
You love badminton.
So what? I love it, too.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.693
But at some point,
you have to ask yourself,

17:05.694 --> 17:08.627
"Is it worth a person's leg?"

17:08.627 --> 17:09.828
Is this the wheel
that was recovered

17:09.829 --> 17:11.358
at the scene of the accident?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.411
Objection!

17:30.517 --> 17:32.817
Sustained! Sustained!

17:34.754 --> 17:38.857
Your Honor, I'd like to call
one final witness...

17:38.858 --> 17:41.358
Detective Jay Geils.

17:51.905 --> 17:55.535
Detective, we are gathered here
for one thing

17:55.542 --> 17:57.242
and one thing only...

17:57.243 --> 18:00.853
Did Aaron McLaren flee
the scene of the crime?

18:04.217 --> 18:06.747
You were there that day.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.193
Did he flee?

18:18.264 --> 18:19.298
No.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.114
There's no way he could have
fled the scene of the crime.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.474
There's no way
he could have fled,

18:29.476 --> 18:31.236
because he's way too slow.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.884
Wait. What'd he say?

18:34.214 --> 18:37.321
He's slow <i> on</i> the court,
he's slow <i> off</i> the court.

18:37.322 --> 18:39.917
He's probably the slowest
athlete I've ever met.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.119
Hey, I ain't slow.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.151
Aaron, you've got this.
Be quiet.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.916
He's just so slow

18:44.924 --> 18:47.394
that there's no way
he could've gotten out of there

18:47.395 --> 18:48.893
before anyone saw him.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.425
I mean, this guy's a real load.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.630
Oh, you want to see fast?
I'll show you fast.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.966
It's a trap!

18:53.967 --> 18:55.467
I hit that guy's truck,
and I was out of there

18:55.468 --> 18:57.398
before the bones
even popped out of his legs.

18:58.673 --> 19:00.511
You ain't never seen a guy
flee that fast!

19:03.409 --> 19:04.639
Order!

19:04.644 --> 19:05.644
Order!!

19:05.645 --> 19:07.105
Objection, Your Honor!

19:07.113 --> 19:09.982
Your Honor, given the admission
from the defendant,

19:09.983 --> 19:12.153
the state would like to invoke
Nanny Nanny Foo Foo

19:12.154 --> 19:14.252
and move
to immediate sentencing.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.320
Motion granted.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.521
Bailiff!

19:19.425 --> 19:20.685
Thank you.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.063
What'd I... What'd I...
What'd I say?

19:24.998 --> 19:27.228
Aah! He got
the cuffs on tight.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.535
You knew he'd crack.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.097
Athletes have egos.
It was just a matter of time.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.506
Pretty good police work...

19:35.508 --> 19:37.038
Lieutenant.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.513
You still willing to get a beer
with one of your cops?

19:39.514 --> 19:41.146
Sure.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.007
I mean, until I make
<i>real</i> lieutenant.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.676
Then probably not.

19:45.305 --> 19:51.825
