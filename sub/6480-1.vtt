01:43.186 --> 01:44.563
Hey!

01:44.646 --> 01:46.068
If you want any tickets,

01:46.148 --> 01:50.779
you'll have to go around to the front of...

01:50.861 --> 01:53.614
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.825
What the hell am I doing around here?

01:55.907 --> 01:57.204
They walk in here and...

02:03.373 --> 02:05.751
Let's see. I hope I got...

02:06.752 --> 02:07.924
Three?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.237
That'll be $7...

02:29.900 --> 02:32.494
...and 50 cents.

06:49.910 --> 06:50.957
No.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.720
Frank?

12:37.674 --> 12:39.517
Frank sent us.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.064
Did you bring a horse for me?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.614
Well, looks like we're...

12:54.857 --> 12:57.280
Looks like we're shy one horse.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.451
You brought two too many.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.956
Hey, Pa!

15:48.030 --> 15:49.407
Look!

16:12.555 --> 16:16.355
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.411
Timmy.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.002
Maureen, look.

18:04.834 --> 18:08.464
What you doing there?
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

18:08.546 --> 18:11.220
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.849
Patrick's already left
for the station, huh?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.804
He's getting ready, Pa.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.140
-Damn it, Patrick!
-Coming, Pa.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.858
Not bad, I'd say.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.492
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.363
But these are the same slices as usual.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.244
Yeah, sure.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.796
As usual.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.877
Maureen.

18:49.295 --> 18:54.552
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.470
You'll have beautiful new clothes

18:57.553 --> 18:59.351
and you won't have to work no more.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.397
We're going to get rich, Pa?

19:08.230 --> 19:09.903
Who knows?

19:11.192 --> 19:12.239
Patrick!

19:13.736 --> 19:14.908
Wait a minute!

19:16.906 --> 19:19.079
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean them.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.127
The train will come in

19:26.207 --> 19:28.050
and there won't be no one
to meet your mother.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.596
Our mother died six years ago.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.352
Go now, or you'll really be late.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.697
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How am I gonna recognize her?

19:52.775 --> 19:54.903
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

19:54.985 --> 20:00.663
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

20:02.284 --> 20:06.960
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

20:07.873 --> 20:14.176
"and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met."

20:25.141 --> 20:28.441
I'm gonna get some fresh water
from the well.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.491
Oh, Danny boy

20:33.566 --> 20:37.742
The pipes, the pipes are calling

20:40.865 --> 20:44.085
And down the mountain side

20:44.160 --> 20:45.958
The summer's gone

20:46.704 --> 20:50.379
And all the roses fall.-.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.103
Maureen!

23:55.351 --> 23:58.355
What are we gonna do
with this one, Frank?

24:14.078 --> 24:15.921
Now that you've called me by name...

25:56.972 --> 25:59.145
I saw some mighty fine stock
down south.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.817
Is that so?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.361
And the prices are good.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.158
-These your valises, ma'am?
-Yes.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.414
-Come, Sarah.
-Bring them other two.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.792
We'll tote them for you, ma'am.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.732
Is that true? The sawmill needs hands?

26:44.812 --> 26:47.656
-Was yesterday.
-Why didn't you tell your brother?

26:47.731 --> 26:50.450
-Hiya, Gramps.
-Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.904
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

26:54.696 --> 26:58.075
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.377
I got a whole train to unload.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.626
All right,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

27:03.705 --> 27:06.174
Come on! Come on!

29:54.126 --> 29:56.424
What's the name of the place
you wanted to go?

29:57.087 --> 29:58.464
Sweetwater.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.726
Brett McBain's farm.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.269
McBain? Yeah, sure.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.770
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

30:09.850 --> 30:13.730
tilling sand for years way out there
in the middle of nowhere.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.610
Sweetwater!

30:15.689 --> 30:17.657
Only a loony like him could call

30:17.733 --> 30:20.828
that stinking piece of desert
Sweetwater.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.246
Sweetwater!

30:26.742 --> 30:28.995
That's good! Sweetwater!

31:13.080 --> 31:15.674
That's right. A little more to the right.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.547
Higher. Higher.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.005
Hold it there.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.392
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

31:33.475 --> 31:36.900
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

31:37.646 --> 31:39.774
Hey, slow down.
What's the matter with you? Slow down!

31:40.357 --> 31:41.825
Hey, boys! Watch out!

31:43.318 --> 31:45.116
Watch out down there!

31:45.195 --> 31:46.242
Slow down!

32:51.720 --> 32:55.350
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.730
Don't the train stop?

34:44.916 --> 34:47.339
What can I do for you, ma'am?

34:47.835 --> 34:50.179
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.427
Water?

34:52.340 --> 34:54.842
Well, you see, that word
is poison around these parts

34:54.926 --> 34:57.224
ever since the days of the great flood.

34:57.304 --> 35:00.729
-You mean you never wash?
-We sure do!

35:00.807 --> 35:03.526
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.149
You sure can.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.276
Just happen to have
a full tub in the back.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.652
And you're lucky.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.655
Only three people
have used it this morning.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.242
Used it one at a time or all together?

35:18.700 --> 35:22.250
I can tell you're accustomed
to fine living.

35:22.329 --> 35:25.503
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.960
-New Orleans.
-New Orleans!

35:28.335 --> 35:30.212
-You've been there?
-No.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.931
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

35:33.006 --> 35:35.259
You know, she...

37:16.443 --> 37:17.490
Jug.

39:23.403 --> 39:27.624
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

39:31.703 --> 39:34.752
Do you know how to blow music
from that?

39:54.934 --> 39:56.811
Pick it up.

40:22.712 --> 40:23.804
You!

40:31.387 --> 40:33.515
You don't know how to play.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.457
Try this one.

41:15.056 --> 41:16.057
Take it.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.745
Go on.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.428
Here.

42:30.506 --> 42:31.849
Bravo.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.287
Cheyenne.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.577
We thought we'd never make it.

42:59.660 --> 43:02.504
It's all right. You're right on time.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.293
To bury my escort.

43:08.002 --> 43:11.597
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.

43:28.523 --> 43:29.775
Hey.

43:38.574 --> 43:40.167
The gun.

44:01.681 --> 44:05.276
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?

44:11.983 --> 44:14.827
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

44:14.902 --> 44:15.903
They were waiting for a train.

44:22.326 --> 44:25.580
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.708
So?

44:30.585 --> 44:33.805
Inside the men, there were three bullets.

44:45.057 --> 44:48.402
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

44:50.438 --> 44:52.065
For two reasons.

44:52.690 --> 44:55.944
One, nobody around
these parts got the guts

44:56.027 --> 44:58.951
to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's men.

44:59.739 --> 45:03.664
Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed.

45:08.289 --> 45:09.461
That surprise you?

45:10.416 --> 45:11.508
Yeah.

45:16.380 --> 45:17.973
Well, you know music.

45:18.674 --> 45:21.894
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

45:30.186 --> 45:32.905
All the way up to six, if I have to.

45:34.482 --> 45:35.984
And maybe faster than you.

45:50.539 --> 45:51.961
Yeah, go on.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.297
Play, Harmonica.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.047
Play, so you can't bullshit.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.179
Only, watch those false notes.

46:10.393 --> 46:11.645
Like so?

46:26.409 --> 46:27.956
And so, this cousin of mine

46:28.035 --> 46:29.878
keeps writing me
to come on down to New Orleans.

46:29.954 --> 46:33.675
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

46:34.500 --> 46:36.923
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.

46:37.003 --> 46:39.472
It's too full of fast men
and loose women.

46:39.547 --> 46:42.050
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

46:42.883 --> 46:47.389
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet, simple country life.

49:17.913 --> 49:19.790
He's Timmy.

49:20.541 --> 49:21.963
Yes.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.758
Dear God.

49:26.213 --> 49:28.215
On the day...

49:29.508 --> 49:32.682
On the very day of your wedding.

49:33.554 --> 49:34.851
Poor little miss.

49:36.891 --> 49:38.359
Mrs...

49:40.478 --> 49:41.855
Mrs. McBain.

49:41.937 --> 49:44.781
But we all... But we thought...

49:45.858 --> 49:47.360
I know.

49:47.443 --> 49:49.696
It was to be a surprise today.

49:51.530 --> 49:53.874
Brett McBain and I were married.

49:54.241 --> 49:55.993
A month ago.

49:56.535 --> 49:58.754
In New Orleans.

50:15.387 --> 50:17.640
"I am the resurrection, and the life.

50:17.723 --> 50:21.353
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

50:21.435 --> 50:24.905
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."

50:24.980 --> 50:26.106
Amen.

50:41.872 --> 50:44.796
-Mr. Bennett!
-What's he doing here?

50:48.087 --> 50:50.886
I found this collar on a nail by the door.

50:54.802 --> 50:58.648
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

50:58.722 --> 51:00.816
Cheyenne's hand.

51:02.351 --> 51:06.197
-But why?
-Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

51:06.272 --> 51:08.821
We'll make them tell us
before we hang them.

51:10.276 --> 51:12.244
Let's get moving.

51:31.505 --> 51:32.757
Come on.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.638
Let's go back to Flagstone.

51:38.679 --> 51:40.431
No, Sam.

51:42.016 --> 51:43.438
You go back.

51:44.852 --> 51:47.446
You don't want to stay out here alone.

51:49.189 --> 51:50.441
Why not?

51:50.858 --> 51:52.485
This is my home.

55:51.515 --> 55:53.358
You know, Wobbles,

55:55.352 --> 55:56.945
I'm kind of mad at you.

56:01.233 --> 56:03.281
Frank wasn't there.

56:04.778 --> 56:06.997
He sent three friends.

56:07.072 --> 56:09.791
I don't know nothing, I swear.

56:10.117 --> 56:14.497
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.959
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

56:18.125 --> 56:21.880
-I swear to you that I...
-'Cause he was at the McBains'.

56:22.462 --> 56:25.215
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.

56:25.299 --> 56:28.098
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.558
That was always one of Frank's tricks.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.435
Faking evidence.

56:34.391 --> 56:35.859
I don't know.

56:36.310 --> 56:37.482
I swear.

56:37.561 --> 56:41.941
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

56:42.024 --> 56:44.493
I don't know nothing.

58:45.105 --> 58:46.527
Who's there?

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.723
Did you make coffee?

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:26.103
Make it.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.776
Didn't sleep a wink.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:40.994
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:46.837
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:49.131
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.979
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:22.164
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:25.746
Idiots.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.002
What the hell?

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:31.252
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.042
Be like killing a priest.

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.049
A Catholic priest, that is.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:41.096
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

01:02:56.648 --> 01:03:00.824
See, I ain't the mean bastard
people make out.

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:09.207
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.043
it fires me up.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:17.677
And a fired-up Cheyenne

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:21.886
ain't a nice thing to see.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.726
Especially for a lady.

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:40.575
But you're too smart to make him mad.

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:50.251
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.249
Yeah.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:57.255
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:07.765
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me,

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:14.185
so they can hang this thing
around my neck,

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.608
I don't like it none.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.823
But I can understand it.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:29.203
What I don't understand is why.

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:32.707
Neither do I.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:40.798
But I see you looked a lot for the why.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:48.594
Yeah.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.059
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:59.230
Round. Yellow.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.482
You know the kind.

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:05.827
You rap them on a stone

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.780
and they go "ding."

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:10.707
Maybe.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:15.503
But I didn't find them.

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:22.753
By the way,

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:27.137
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:31.978
He's somebody you'd remember.

01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:36.274
Instead of talking, he plays.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:40.313
And when he'd better play, he talks.

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:48.449
You know, ma'am, when you've
Killed four, it's easy to make it five.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:55.206
Sure. You're an expert.

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:03.009
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.262
Of course I have.

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:14.600
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:18.350
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.310
And even call in your men.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:23.237
Well, no woman ever died from that.

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:26.984
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.823
and I'll be exactly what I was before.

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:33.744
With just another filthy memory.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:52.429
You make good coffee, at least?

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.723
Not bad.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:56.979
Congratulations.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:01.143
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:03.653
I only told you to scare them.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.399
People scare better when they're dying.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:11.577
And can you tell me what good
was your stupid massacre?

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.157
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:21.170
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:24.799
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.470
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:31.677
You know that.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:36.557
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.893
and before my eyes rot,

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:44.566
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.110
I know where you got on board.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:50.817
I was there, too, remember?

01:07:55.697 --> 01:08:01.329
"To remove small obstacles
from the track," you said.

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:04.998
Well, there were a few.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:12.054
But we traveled a long way,
just the same.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.177
And fast.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:17.805
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:23.475
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:27.020
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:33.868
I watch that dry rot rise
a little more every day.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:38.913
Any normal man would
put a bullet in his brain.

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:43.120
But you, you just got a little more hasty.

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.214
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:48.837
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.292
A lot.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:55.223
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.594
Now, you're keeping in the background.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.224
You'll end up giving orders.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:09.817
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:15.283
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:18.947
-Like a friend.
-Or like a partner.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:33.127
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:38.925
It's almost like holding a gun.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.441
Only much more powerful.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:05.536
You see, staying with you,

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:10.464
I'm beginning to think big, too.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:15.553
This McBain business

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.474
has given me ideas.

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:29.727
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.193
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.242
Why?

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:43.995
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:56.673
This is one of them.

01:10:57.628 --> 01:11:01.383
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:06.309
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:03.657
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:09.664
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:14.960
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:19.260
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.925
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:27.802
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:30.684
And then you happen
to meet a man like this,

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.356
who looked like a good man.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.935
Clear eyes, strong hands.

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.357
And he wants to marry you.

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:39.610
Which doesn't happen often.

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:43.034
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:49.162
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:52.577
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:58.167
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.801
"Take care of a house.
Do something. What the hell?"

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:17.685
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:22.566
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:41.042
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:45.592
If you can find it, you're welcome to it.

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:48.470
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:51.978
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:06.943
You deserve better.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:13.325
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.503
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.843
She was the biggest whore in Alameda

01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:34.554
and the finest woman that ever lived.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.730
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.279
he must have been a happy man.

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:56.451
Hey! Hey!

01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:59.082
Hey!

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.483
What do you want?

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:09.030
Cheyenne's right.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:13.236
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.719
This isn't the time to leave.

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:33.816
Give me some water-

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:44.911
From the well.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.706
I like my water fresh.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.296
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.008
A sound? Like what?

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.268
Like that.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:20:00.380
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:35.756
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:38.755
-What brings you to town?
-Good morning.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:41.880
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.930
I remember very well.

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:47.177
Is there something I can do for you?

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:49.766
Yes.

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:55.435
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:58.521
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.232
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:05.362
I got my own worries,
and all I want is to be left in peace.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:08.990
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:07.097
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:11.223
Whatever business you have with Frank,
keep it far away from here.

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:12.769
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton,

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:14.688
but when I heard that woman say
she knew everything,

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.141
I thought that the important thing
was for me to come over here

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:18.441
right away and tell you about it.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.569
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:22.855
Sure, but you know
that I'm mighty careful, Frank.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.282
No one could have followed me.

01:22:25.983 --> 01:22:28.236
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.954
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:35.118
You should learn to live
as if you didn't exist.

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:37.749
You've known me a long time, Frank.

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:39.671
You know you can trust me.

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:41.498
Wobbles.

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:49.886
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:53.806
The man can't even trust his own pants.

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:05.072
Let's get out of here.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:46.582
The end of the line.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:50.593
Yeah.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.060
Get him on board.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.318
Tie him up.

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:49.357
Wait, Frank.

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:51.650
I didn't. ..

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.528
So, nobody followed you?

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:56.451
No. You gotta believe me.

01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:59.955
So, this is the way I can trust you.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.954
I can explain. I didn't know that he...

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:06.545
-Get out.
-No. No. No, Frank.

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:08.880
Get out.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:29.985
Frank, wait!

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:54.293
I told you to keep quiet.

01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:01.474
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.518
Someone took care of them.

01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.230
We found them out at McBain's place.

01:27:06.596 --> 01:27:09.019
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:13.153
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:27.247
First three, then two.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:42.137
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:46.979
And you're the one
who doesn't keep them.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.353
What do you want?

01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:52.980
Who are you?

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:57.906
Dave Jenkins.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.659
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:11.711
Calder Benson.

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:16.046
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.

01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:20.136
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:21.555
You killed him.

01:28:22.214 --> 01:28:23.431
Who are you?

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:25.888
-Who are you, you...
-Frank!

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.471
The woman.

01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:33.563
We're only losing time.

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:40.399
All right.

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:43.656
This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:46.325
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:53.252
Keep him warm for me.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:55.922
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

01:28:56.248 --> 01:29:00.128
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:07.851
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:10.679
By the way, I want you to keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:12.105
-Understand?
-Sure, Frank.

01:30:45.231 --> 01:30:47.359
-See anyone?
-No.

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:08.588
There he is.

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:54.888
You only know how to shoot?

01:33:56.381 --> 01:33:58.679
Or do you know how to cut, too?

01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:11.237
Hey, you.

01:34:13.398 --> 01:34:15.241
Wait a minute.

01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:18.620
Let's have a good look at you.

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.667
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:53.229
It's easy to find you.

01:34:53.855 --> 01:34:54.856
Bastard.

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:56.907
I don't have to kill you now.

01:34:56.983 --> 01:34:59.782
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:03.369
Two beautiful shiny rails.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.242
There's another bastard.

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:10.125
And he's getting further away
every minute.

01:35:21.883 --> 01:35:23.055
There it is.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:24.602
Exactly what your husband ordered
from me.

01:35:24.677 --> 01:35:27.180
And seeing as how he paid cash
on the barrelhead,

01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:28.810
it all belongs to you.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.144
Oak planks, beech, pine.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.278
All first-grade lumber.

01:35:34.354 --> 01:35:37.073
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

01:35:37.357 --> 01:35:41.453
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:43.872
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:45.824
Enlarge the farmhouse?

01:35:46.366 --> 01:35:49.210
He could have built
at least eight of them.

01:35:49.285 --> 01:35:50.958
By the way, ma'am,

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:54.841
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:59.129
Only it seems he forgot to tell me
what he wanted printed on it.

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:08.308
Station.

01:36:09.973 --> 01:36:10.974
How's that again?

01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:13.351
I said print "station."

01:36:45.842 --> 01:36:47.469
Looking for this?

01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:50.893
I've had enough of your butcher tactics.

01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:52.895
I know that woman is here.

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:56.019
I don't want any more useless killing.

01:36:57.103 --> 01:36:59.447
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:01.490
To pay what's necessary.

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:04.069
I don't want to waste any more time.

01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:07.246
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:15.838
When you're not on that train,
you look like a turtle out of its shell.

01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:17.757
Just funny.

01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:19.626
Poor cripple talking big

01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:22.383
so nobody will know
how scared you are.

01:37:22.795 --> 01:37:24.388
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.098
I don't have time to compete with you.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.817
Compete?

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:42.570
Why, you...

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:45.902
You can't even stand
on your own feet by yourself.

01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:59.295
Ls that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

01:38:00.124 --> 01:38:02.752
I could squash you like a wormy apple.

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:08.262
Sure, but you won't do it.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.645
Because it's not to your advantage.

01:38:19.769 --> 01:38:22.818
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs.

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:34.246
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.090
Morton. Don't worry about the land.

01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:42.087
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:44.009
Of course, it won't make
any difference to you

01:38:44.085 --> 01:38:46.179
dealing with the new owner.

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:15.413
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!

01:39:16.242 --> 01:39:18.791
There's a square staked out here.
It says "water tank."

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:22.920
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office."

01:39:23.499 --> 01:39:25.217
And this one says "corral."

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:28.304
And this here "church."

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:30.757
What the hell is this?

01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:32.558
Can't you see?

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:35.265
It's a station.

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.685
And all around it, a town.

01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:43.269
Brett McBain's town.

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:47.903
Was he crazy!

01:39:49.192 --> 01:39:51.490
Yeah, in a very special way.

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:54.447
An Irishman.

01:39:56.449 --> 01:39:57.496
He knew, sooner or later,

01:39:57.575 --> 01:40:00.875
that railroad coming through Flagstone
would continue on west.

01:40:00.953 --> 01:40:03.797
So he looked over
all this country out here

01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:07.548
until he found this hunk of desert.

01:40:07.627 --> 01:40:09.755
Nobody wanted it.

01:40:13.758 --> 01:40:15.055
But he bought it.

01:40:17.803 --> 01:40:22.354
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:25.653
Waited for what?

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:29.699
For the railroad to reach this point.

01:40:30.566 --> 01:40:32.785
But how in the hell could he be sure

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.784
the railroad would pass
through his property?

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:40.038
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

01:40:40.493 --> 01:40:45.124
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:47.299
Under this land.

01:40:47.959 --> 01:40:50.838
He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?

01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:56.138
He was going to sell this piece of desert
for its weight in gold, wasn't he?

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:59.687
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.

01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:03.641
Brett McBain wanted his station.

01:41:06.269 --> 01:41:08.488
He got the rights to build it.

01:41:10.648 --> 01:41:13.401
-How do you know all this?
-I saw a document.

01:41:13.484 --> 01:41:16.784
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:19.244
One thing, though.

01:41:19.323 --> 01:41:23.499
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:28.083
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

01:41:28.165 --> 01:41:31.294
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point,

01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:34.843
the station ain't built yet.

01:41:41.846 --> 01:41:45.942
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

01:41:46.684 --> 01:41:48.231
Hey.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:53.241
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

01:41:53.316 --> 01:41:57.742
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

01:41:58.195 --> 01:41:59.321
Yeah.

01:41:59.989 --> 01:42:01.081
Yeah.

01:42:02.533 --> 01:42:03.705
Listen.

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.003
Harmonica.

01:42:07.038 --> 01:42:10.258
A town built around the railroad.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.719
You could make a fortune, huh?

01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:17.802
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

01:42:19.216 --> 01:42:20.968
Hey, more than that.

01:42:22.428 --> 01:42:24.351
Thousands of thousands.

01:42:25.723 --> 01:42:27.725
They call them millions.

01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:30.770
Millions?

01:42:34.273 --> 01:42:36.651
-Yeah, millions.
-Yeah.

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:40.989
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:43.533
All you gotta do is...

01:42:46.285 --> 01:42:49.664
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?

01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:52.334
But, chief, what are we supposed to do?

01:42:52.416 --> 01:42:54.510
What are you supposed to do?

01:42:54.585 --> 01:42:57.259
Build a station, idiots!

01:43:00.091 --> 01:43:03.061
I figure it ain't gonna look like much.

01:43:06.097 --> 01:43:10.022
But it'll be the first thing she sees
when she gets back.

01:43:11.268 --> 01:43:12.895
If she gets back.

01:44:33.058 --> 01:44:34.401
I think...

01:44:43.068 --> 01:44:44.194
Yeah.

01:44:45.404 --> 01:44:49.534
I'm beginning to think
I might be a little sorry killing you.

01:44:52.036 --> 01:44:53.834
You like being alive.

01:45:07.635 --> 01:45:10.809
You also like to feel
a man's hands all over you.

01:45:12.807 --> 01:45:14.229
You like it.

01:45:18.646 --> 01:45:22.446
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

01:45:42.503 --> 01:45:43.755
What a. ..

01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:49.135
What a little tramp.

01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:56.268
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

01:45:59.937 --> 01:46:01.484
Nothing, Frank.

01:46:25.337 --> 01:46:28.307
Now I understand
why they miss you so much

01:46:29.842 --> 01:46:33.722
down there in New Orleans.

01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:38.976
Great invention, the telegraph.

01:46:42.479 --> 01:46:45.232
"Jill? The brunette?

01:46:45.941 --> 01:46:47.568
"My God, all the customers

01:46:47.651 --> 01:46:50.245
"of the most elegant whorehouse
on Bourbon Street

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:53.325
"have been weeping ever since she left."

01:46:55.784 --> 01:46:57.252
Say, tell me.

01:46:58.746 --> 01:47:00.498
Did old McBain know?

01:47:01.415 --> 01:47:02.507
Yeah.

01:47:04.001 --> 01:47:05.753
Yeah, I bet he did.

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:09.014
He was just the type to marry a whore.

01:47:12.343 --> 01:47:13.435
Hey.

01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:16.647
It's an idea.

01:47:19.058 --> 01:47:20.731
I could marry you.

01:47:22.186 --> 01:47:24.484
And the land would become mine.

01:47:25.314 --> 01:47:26.566
And maybe

01:47:29.443 --> 01:47:31.491
you'd make a perfect wife.

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:39.587
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

01:47:40.955 --> 01:47:42.207
Too bad.

01:47:43.207 --> 01:47:45.926
We'll have to think of another solution.

01:47:46.335 --> 01:47:47.882
Simpler.

01:47:53.217 --> 01:47:54.469
Quicker.

01:48:16.615 --> 01:48:18.788
As sheriff of this county,

01:48:18.867 --> 01:48:22.292
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

01:48:22.371 --> 01:48:26.922
of all property belonging
to Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.

01:48:27.376 --> 01:48:30.846
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.

01:48:30.921 --> 01:48:35.176
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

01:48:36.218 --> 01:48:38.346
This property and all it contains,

01:48:38.429 --> 01:48:40.682
lock, stock and barrel,

01:48:40.764 --> 01:48:44.314
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

01:48:44.393 --> 01:48:47.146
All the contents therein
are listed by number

01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:50.153
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

01:48:50.232 --> 01:48:54.157
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

01:48:54.236 --> 01:48:55.783
All right. That's clear to everybody.

01:48:57.698 --> 01:48:59.371
I declare the auction open.

01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:02.495
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

01:49:07.124 --> 01:49:11.254
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.

01:49:12.337 --> 01:49:15.967
All right.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

01:49:19.928 --> 01:49:21.475
$200.

01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:24.976
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

01:49:25.434 --> 01:49:28.904
$200. Do I hear more?

01:49:28.979 --> 01:49:31.732
That stinking piece of land ain't worth it.

01:49:31.815 --> 01:49:32.941
Is it, old-timer?

01:49:33.025 --> 01:49:36.074
Come on, my friends, $200.

01:49:36.612 --> 01:49:39.536
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

01:49:41.158 --> 01:49:42.330
Well...

01:49:43.535 --> 01:49:45.833
Who's going to bid $3007

01:49:49.875 --> 01:49:51.593
Now, look, friends,

01:49:51.668 --> 01:49:54.842
I realize we're not offering
California here,

01:49:54.922 --> 01:49:58.176
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

01:49:58.258 --> 01:50:02.354
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.

01:50:05.682 --> 01:50:09.107
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:20.493
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:24.994
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain,

01:50:25.077 --> 01:50:28.047
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:37.510
All I want is to sell.

01:51:44.406 --> 01:51:47.159
-You look fat, huh?
-If you say so.

01:51:48.327 --> 01:51:50.125
-How many?
-One card.

01:51:52.664 --> 01:51:54.041
One for me.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.712
Dealer takes three.

01:52:09.306 --> 01:52:11.604
Can I... Can I take a hand?

01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:19.400
Fifteen.

01:52:32.788 --> 01:52:34.756
Yeah, sit down.

01:52:58.438 --> 01:52:59.781
I'll deal.

01:54:44.961 --> 01:54:46.429
How do you...

01:54:47.798 --> 01:54:50.517
How do you play this game, Mr. Morton?

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:54.847
It's very simple.

01:54:56.181 --> 01:55:00.732
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

01:55:01.603 --> 01:55:03.150
$500.

01:55:08.777 --> 01:55:10.199
$500.

01:55:12.364 --> 01:55:14.366
Do I hear any other bids?

01:55:16.785 --> 01:55:18.412
I don't think so.

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.131
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain,

01:55:29.214 --> 01:55:34.186
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

01:55:45.230 --> 01:55:46.903
$500 once.

01:55:50.152 --> 01:55:52.371
$500 twice.

01:55:55.365 --> 01:55:57.834
-$500...
-$5,000.

01:56:21.725 --> 01:56:26.026
-You said $5,000?
-It's on its way.

01:56:38.992 --> 01:56:40.835
It's Cheyenne!

01:56:50.587 --> 01:56:53.682
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

01:56:54.090 --> 01:56:58.140
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

01:56:58.762 --> 01:57:01.265
There were no dollars in them days.

01:57:03.433 --> 01:57:05.777
But sons of bitches, yeah.

01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:22.044
Hey, wait a minute.

01:57:24.079 --> 01:57:26.923
-The jail's that way.
-Yeah, I know.

01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:30.715
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:34.305
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

01:57:34.381 --> 01:57:36.429
They got a modern jail there.

01:57:36.758 --> 01:57:41.138
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

01:57:41.972 --> 01:57:45.818
You'll like it, in 20 years. You'll see.

01:58:47.203 --> 01:58:50.503
Two tickets, amigo, to the next station.

01:58:50.582 --> 01:58:52.050
One way only.

01:58:54.836 --> 01:58:57.680
Here's to you. And congratulations.

01:59:02.552 --> 01:59:04.771
You got yourself a good deal.

01:59:06.222 --> 01:59:07.599
The auction.

01:59:08.725 --> 01:59:12.150
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

01:59:14.773 --> 01:59:19.244
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenseless widows.

01:59:21.237 --> 01:59:22.739
But then again,

01:59:25.617 --> 01:59:28.746
I don't look like
a poor defenseless widow.

01:59:35.585 --> 01:59:37.804
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

01:59:39.798 --> 01:59:41.892
And you're a remarkable man.

01:59:42.717 --> 01:59:45.266
But you have something on your mind.

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:53.145
And you got something on your mind.

01:59:56.815 --> 02:00:00.786
Hot water. A bathtub full of hot water.

02:00:19.504 --> 02:00:22.223
I think it's time I filled that bathtub.

02:00:53.163 --> 02:00:54.380
Who are you?

02:01:15.977 --> 02:01:17.354
Jim Cooper.

02:01:18.354 --> 02:01:20.027
Chuck Youngblood.

02:01:21.024 --> 02:01:22.526
More dead men.

02:01:26.362 --> 02:01:29.366
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

02:01:35.622 --> 02:01:38.796
You paid $5,000 for something
that belongs to me.

02:01:44.005 --> 02:01:45.177
5,000.

02:01:50.303 --> 02:01:52.226
Plus one.

02:01:57.769 --> 02:01:59.988
You've got a right to make a profit, too.

02:02:27.090 --> 02:02:30.185
I wouldn't take too long thinking about it,
if I were you.

02:02:35.056 --> 02:02:37.354
You got yourself into something
that's bigger than you are.

02:02:37.433 --> 02:02:40.107
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

02:02:40.562 --> 02:02:43.281
You sound like
a real businessman, Frank.

02:02:44.107 --> 02:02:47.327
Being with Mr. Morton
has done you a lot of good.

02:02:54.868 --> 02:02:56.836
And you've learned some new methods.

02:02:59.163 --> 02:03:02.087
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown you
a lot of new ways.

02:03:06.838 --> 02:03:09.466
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

02:03:10.717 --> 02:03:13.641
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

02:03:16.431 --> 02:03:18.104
Which deal, Frank?

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:23.070
We have more than one, you and me.

02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:32.407
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

02:03:33.031 --> 02:03:34.499
Here and now.

02:03:36.743 --> 02:03:38.495
Easy, Frank.

02:03:39.162 --> 02:03:40.288
Easy.

02:03:41.456 --> 02:03:43.629
You gotta learn not to push things.

02:03:43.875 --> 02:03:46.845
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

02:03:50.173 --> 02:03:53.848
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

02:03:57.847 --> 02:03:59.144
How much?

02:04:00.516 --> 02:04:01.859
$1.

02:05:06.958 --> 02:05:08.585
Giddy up!

02:06:42.929 --> 02:06:44.351
Giddy up!

02:07:48.536 --> 02:07:51.210
I could swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

02:07:51.289 --> 02:07:52.632
Right now.

02:09:45.569 --> 02:09:46.991
Time sure flies.

02:09:48.781 --> 02:09:50.579
It's already past 12:00.

02:10:50.217 --> 02:10:52.595
But... But they were his men.

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:55.101
-Yeah.
-And they tried to kill him.

02:10:55.556 --> 02:10:57.433
They must have found somebody
who pays better.

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:58.563
And you!

02:10:58.976 --> 02:11:00.853
You saved his life.

02:11:03.481 --> 02:11:06.610
I didn't let them kill him
and that's not the same thing.

02:11:19.455 --> 02:11:20.877
Sure.

02:11:21.457 --> 02:11:23.926
It's not the same thing.

02:11:31.258 --> 02:11:32.851
You get dressed.

02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:34.682
It's time to go home.

02:16:54.289 --> 02:16:56.040
Did you make coffee?

02:16:57.584 --> 02:16:59.177
This time I did.

02:17:39.668 --> 02:17:40.760
Good.

02:17:43.379 --> 02:17:46.509
My mother used to make
coffee this way.

02:17:47.342 --> 02:17:52.018
Hot, strong and good.

02:18:01.522 --> 02:18:03.196
Cheyenne.

02:18:05.402 --> 02:18:07.745
What's he waiting for out there?

02:18:10.365 --> 02:18:11.491
What's he doing?

02:18:17.498 --> 02:18:19.921
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:25.180
I got a feeling when he stops whittling,

02:18:26.632 --> 02:18:28.634
something's gonna happen.

02:19:37.201 --> 02:19:39.204
Surprised to see me here?

02:19:41.331 --> 02:19:43.004
I knew you'd come.

02:20:06.690 --> 02:20:09.694
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

02:20:11.028 --> 02:20:12.826
Now I understand why.

02:20:15.157 --> 02:20:19.503
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

02:20:20.662 --> 02:20:24.007
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

02:20:24.541 --> 02:20:25.713
Just a man.

02:20:28.378 --> 02:20:30.005
An ancient race.

02:20:36.386 --> 02:20:40.687
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

02:20:41.058 --> 02:20:43.026
The future don't matter to us.

02:20:43.894 --> 02:20:45.111
Nothing matters now.

02:20:45.187 --> 02:20:48.532
Not the land, not the money,
not the woman.

02:20:49.149 --> 02:20:51.026
I came here to see you.

02:20:53.612 --> 02:20:56.707
'Cause I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

02:21:12.005 --> 02:21:14.099
Only at the point of dying.

02:21:17.427 --> 02:21:18.644
I know.

02:22:03.306 --> 02:22:07.027
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

02:22:07.978 --> 02:22:10.106
Put it there, please.

02:22:12.524 --> 02:22:16.245
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

02:22:22.743 --> 02:22:24.120
You know what?

02:22:25.912 --> 02:22:28.586
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:39.843
You can't imagine

02:22:41.136 --> 02:22:44.310
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

02:22:46.767 --> 02:22:48.519
Just to look at her.

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:55.484
And if one of them
should pat your behind,

02:22:57.527 --> 02:23:00.155
just make believe it's nothing.

02:23:03.116 --> 02:23:04.663
They earned it.

02:27:38.933 --> 02:27:41.277
Keep your loving brother happy.

02:31:00.218 --> 02:31:02.641
Who... Who are you?

02:32:10.413 --> 02:32:14.259
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

02:32:17.378 --> 02:32:19.426
But I'm not the right man.

02:32:32.310 --> 02:32:33.983
And neither is he.

02:32:36.814 --> 02:32:38.157
Maybe not.

02:32:38.733 --> 02:32:40.235
But it doesn't matter.

02:32:44.614 --> 02:32:46.742
You don't understand, Jill.

02:32:48.284 --> 02:32:51.254
People like that have something inside.

02:32:53.581 --> 02:32:55.879
Something to do with death.

02:32:59.253 --> 02:33:03.429
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:06.598
pick up his gear and say adiós.

02:33:12.350 --> 02:33:14.978
It would be nice to see this town grow.

02:34:47.028 --> 02:34:48.371
Now I gotta go.

02:35:34.659 --> 02:35:38.254
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

02:35:42.917 --> 02:35:45.261
I hope you'll come back someday.

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:04.272
Someday.

02:36:16.659 --> 02:36:20.539
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:48.528
Make believe it's nothing.

02:38:54.108 --> 02:38:55.781
Sorry, Harmonica.

02:38:56.318 --> 02:38:58.320
I gotta stay here.

02:39:36.901 --> 02:39:37.993
Who?

02:39:41.697 --> 02:39:43.699
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

02:39:44.742 --> 02:39:48.167
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

02:39:48.996 --> 02:39:50.998
He got scared.

02:40:09.475 --> 02:40:11.022
Hey, Harmonica.

02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:14.272
When they do you in,

02:40:15.022 --> 02:40:17.525
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

02:40:33.374 --> 02:40:34.500
Go away.

02:40:37.545 --> 02:40:38.797
Go away.

02:40:39.505 --> 02:40:42.554
Go away. I don't want you to see me die.
