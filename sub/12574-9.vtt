00:29.745 --> 00:33.015
Welcome to the Palace
of the Prophets.

00:33.016 --> 00:35.168
It's beautiful.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.534
I searched for you
for 24 years, Richard.

00:38.235 --> 00:42.798
To bring you here, to my home,
to be trained as a Wizard.

00:42.799 --> 00:45.319
So often I thought this day
would never come.

00:48.134 --> 00:51.185
Well, at least we arrived before
you turned me completely gray.

00:55.815 --> 00:56.920
Another headache?

00:58.365 --> 01:00.708
Once you're inside the palace
walls the pain will go away.

01:00.709 --> 01:02.551
How?

01:02.552 --> 01:04.593
The palace is spelled
to carry the burden

01:04.595 --> 01:07.238
that young Wizards
can't yet carry themselves.

01:07.239 --> 01:09.418
Well, the quicker I learn
to handle it on my own,

01:09.419 --> 01:11.023
the quicker I can get back
to my quest.

01:11.024 --> 01:12.864
And my friends.

Welcome home.

02:02.271 --> 02:04.376
And you must be Richard.

02:04.377 --> 02:05.714
Richard, this is

02:05.715 --> 02:07.787
Annalina Aldurren,
the Prelate,

02:07.788 --> 02:10.393
our spiritual leader.

02:10.394 --> 02:13.101
We have waited
so long to meet you.

02:13.102 --> 02:15.039
Welcome to the Palace
of the Prophets.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.242
Thank you.

02:16.243 --> 02:22.024
We'll speak later.
After devotions, yes?

02:22.025 --> 02:26.301

02:26.302 --> 02:31.616

02:36.361 --> 02:38.566

02:38.567 --> 02:40.538
Please rise.

02:45.651 --> 02:46.585
Sister Brenna?

03:02.557 --> 03:05.060
Sister Brenna's weak heart
finally gave out,

03:05.061 --> 03:07.933
but the radiant look
of peace on her face

03:07.934 --> 03:12.643
can only mean
she is with the Creator now.

03:14.347 --> 03:16.718
Thank you, Sister Nicci.

03:16.719 --> 03:18.388
Could you please prepare
the funeral pyre?

03:18.389 --> 03:19.356
Yes, Prelate.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.573
Prelate,

03:27.574 --> 03:31.112
may I leave Sister Brenna's
hymn book with her?

03:31.113 --> 03:32.949
She loved it so.

03:32.950 --> 03:35.086
Of course, Sister Ulicia.

03:42.035 --> 03:45.541
This rash.
I've seen it before.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.647
It's caused by a deadly poison
from a rare vine

03:47.648 --> 03:48.649
called creeping elder.

03:48.650 --> 03:50.552
Sisters, please excuse us.

03:53.659 --> 03:55.128
I should have known
better than to try

03:55.129 --> 03:57.231
and keep the Seeker of Truth
in the dark.

03:57.232 --> 04:00.237
I think Sister Brenna
took her own life.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.644
Perhaps with that poison
you mentioned.

04:03.645 --> 04:05.513
Why would she do
such a thing?

04:05.514 --> 04:08.382
Many months ago
I sent Sister Brenna

04:08.383 --> 04:10.049
on a service mission.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.251
When she returned, she said
that during her time away

04:13.252 --> 04:14.752
she'd become
troubled in her heart.

04:14.753 --> 04:19.387
She witnessed fear,
sickness, famine.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.721
"Starving children can't survive

04:20.723 --> 04:22.089
on the Creator's light,
Prelate."

04:22.091 --> 04:23.024
That's what she told me.

04:24.493 --> 04:26.860
I was afraid she might
do something like this.

04:26.861 --> 04:29.229
Then why did you tell everyone
her heart gave out?

04:29.230 --> 04:30.863
The Sisters of the Light

04:30.864 --> 04:33.064
believe suicide is an offense
to the Creator.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.701
I didn't want to dishonor her
in front of the others.

04:35.702 --> 04:37.736
How can you be sure
someone didn't poison her?

04:37.737 --> 04:39.937
Richard, you heard
what the Prelate said.

04:39.938 --> 04:41.139
Brenna wasn't well.

04:41.140 --> 04:42.907
Why would she kill herself
during devotions?

04:42.908 --> 04:45.276
As opposed to what?
Killing herself during teatime?

04:45.277 --> 04:47.845
You've both had such
a long journey.

04:46.846 --> 04:51.949
Verna, why don't you show
Richard to his quarters.

04:51.950 --> 04:55.019
Your Wizard training
can begin in the morning.

04:58.958 --> 05:01.392
Has a Sister ever taken her life
at the palace before?

05:01.393 --> 05:04.262
Verna Sauventreen.

05:04.263 --> 05:07.597
Sister Philomena.
Welcome back, welcome back.

05:07.598 --> 05:10.133
And you must be our new Wizard.

05:10.134 --> 05:11.200
How terribly exciting.

05:11.201 --> 05:12.501
I'm not really a Wizard--

05:13.869 --> 05:15.303
Oh, forgive me.

05:15.304 --> 05:16.737
I saw you put your hands up

05:16.738 --> 05:19.873
and thought you were going
to blast me with Wizard's Fire.

05:24.545 --> 05:25.777
Are you all right?

05:25.778 --> 05:28.146
We have so much to catch up on.

05:28.147 --> 05:29.780
Trust no one.
Yes, I'm sure we do.

05:29.781 --> 05:32.148
meet me tonight when moonbeams
flood the sanctuary.

05:32.149 --> 05:33.650
It was-- It was good to see you.

05:33.651 --> 05:34.984
Uh, Richard?

05:34.985 --> 05:37.152
how unfortunate that just as you
return from one mission

05:37.153 --> 05:39.119
in the New World,
I'm setting off on another.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.921
So many poor souls

05:40.922 --> 05:42.888
in need of the Creator's light,
you know.

05:42.889 --> 05:45.522
A sister's work is never done.

05:45.523 --> 05:46.857
Speaking of a sister's work,

05:46.858 --> 05:48.825
I need to see Richard
to his room.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.793
Young Wizard, may the Creator's
light illuminate your path.

05:54.162 --> 05:56.530
The Prelate's probably
sending her on a mission

05:56.531 --> 05:58.031
just to get rid of her.

05:58.032 --> 05:58.998
Your room.

06:06.606 --> 06:09.574
I'll be back in the morning
to begin your training.

06:09.575 --> 06:10.908
Good.

06:10.909 --> 06:12.876
The sooner we start,
the sooner I can get out of here

06:12.877 --> 06:13.911
and get back to the New World.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.426
Is something wrong?

06:37.163 --> 06:38.530
I miss Richard.

06:38.531 --> 06:39.698
Why?

06:43.835 --> 06:48.505
Because I love him and I'm not
used to being apart from him.

06:48.506 --> 06:51.541
It's not necessary to feel
pain over his absence.

06:53.343 --> 06:54.743
Don't you feel anything?

06:58.981 --> 07:01.615
Mord-Sith believe emotions
must be governed.

07:01.616 --> 07:06.119
Sadness, remorse, love...
These feelings make you weak.

07:06.120 --> 07:11.790
But anger, loyalty, pride?

07:11.791 --> 07:13.992
These feelings
make you powerful.

07:13.993 --> 07:17.828
I can teach you how to control
your emotions, if you like.

07:17.829 --> 07:21.031
I'm not sure love
makes a person weak, Cara.

07:21.032 --> 07:22.866
Then why are you sitting
on the ground

07:22.867 --> 07:24.300
weeping over a sword?

07:27.071 --> 07:29.406
Thank you for your advice,

07:29.407 --> 07:33.209
but, uh,
I think I'll be all right.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.714
I hope Zedd is all right.

07:40.916 --> 07:42.350
Zedd can handle himself.

07:42.351 --> 07:44.151
I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

07:54.560 --> 07:59.729
Can I help you
with something, Zeddicus?

07:59.730 --> 08:01.498
You know exactly why I've come.

08:01.499 --> 08:02.566
Yes.

08:02.667 --> 08:06.367
Because you realize that Richard Cypher
will fail at his quest.

08:06.470 --> 08:09.605
And someone very wise told you
that if you do not name

08:09.706 --> 08:12.040
a new Seeker,
the world will perish,

08:12.041 --> 08:15.143
which, in your blindness
and your pride,

08:15.144 --> 08:16.477
you chose to ignore.

08:16.478 --> 08:18.311
Are you just
interested in gloating,

08:18.412 --> 08:20.380
or do you have
a candidate in mind?

08:20.381 --> 08:23.148
As a matter of fact, I do.

08:23.149 --> 08:25.416
Remember, not just anyone
can be the Seeker.

08:25.517 --> 08:29.452
He must be courageous, strong,
compassionate, and above all,

08:29.453 --> 08:31.420
relentless in the pursuit
of truth.

08:31.421 --> 08:34.756
Fortunately, I have glimpsed
just such a man in my vision.

08:34.756 --> 08:37.291
Come, let me show him to you.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.861
Shota, if this turns out
to be one of your tricks

08:40.861 --> 08:42.395
it will be your last.

08:42.395 --> 08:43.563
No tricks.

08:43.563 --> 08:46.131
A new Seeker is our only hope.

08:55.132 --> 08:56.532
There he is.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.285
Who are you?

09:17.256 --> 09:19.390
I am Sister Nicci.

09:19.391 --> 09:20.558
I saw you today.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.426
With the Prelate.
Yes.

09:22.427 --> 09:25.463
She considers me one
of her closest advisers.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.164
Why did you ask me here?

09:29.034 --> 09:30.835
To tell you a secret
that could get me killed.

09:30.836 --> 09:34.337
But you must know the truth.

09:34.338 --> 09:35.939
What truth?

09:35.940 --> 09:37.909
How old do you think I am?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.944
By the reckoning of the world

09:39.945 --> 09:41.914
outside the Palace
of the Prophets,

09:41.915 --> 09:44.851
I am nearly
300 years old.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.386
How is that possible?

09:47.387 --> 09:49.122
The palace is spelled.

09:49.123 --> 09:52.293
For every day
that passes in here,

09:52.294 --> 09:55.261
ten days pass
in the outside world.

09:55.262 --> 10:01.066
If that's true,
then if I'm here a month,

10:01.067 --> 10:03.268
almost a year will
go by for my friends.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.871
Yes, and if your Wizard training
takes only a year--

10:06.872 --> 10:08.907
Ten years will pass
on the outside?

10:08.908 --> 10:10.341
And by that time,

10:10.342 --> 10:11.643
your friends could be dead.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.212
Your quest could be meaningless.

10:14.213 --> 10:17.081
The Keeper could have already
destroyed all life.

10:21.523 --> 10:22.923
Why didn't anyone
tell me this?

10:22.924 --> 10:25.892
The Prelate believed you
wouldn't stay if you found out

10:25.893 --> 10:28.294
so she ordered the Sisters
not to speak of it.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.896
But you're telling me. Why?

10:42.573 --> 10:45.140
Because I don't believe
it's right to keep you

10:45.141 --> 10:47.842
from pursuing your quest
by perpetrating a lie.

10:47.843 --> 10:50.545
Are the headaches
a lie too?

10:50.546 --> 10:52.346
No, I'm afraid
those are real.

10:57.485 --> 10:59.185
What are you doing?

10:59.186 --> 11:00.720
Showing you your han.

11:00.721 --> 11:04.156
The essence
of your magic.

11:04.157 --> 11:06.825
Sisters of the Light
have the ability to sense it.

11:10.396 --> 11:13.330
Your han is the strongest
I've ever felt.

11:13.331 --> 11:16.099
It's what's been
causing your pain.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.200
And it's also why the Prelate

11:17.201 --> 11:19.535
is so intent
on keeping you here.

11:19.536 --> 11:20.837
Because I'd die otherwise?

11:20.838 --> 11:22.071
That's only part of it.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.572
What she really wants
is to train

11:23.573 --> 11:25.807
the most powerful wizard
in 3,000 years

11:25.808 --> 11:28.176
to be her disciple,
to fight her enemies.

11:28.177 --> 11:30.077
You mean the Keeper?
No.

11:30.078 --> 11:33.580
The Prelate wants to stop
you from pursuing your quest.

11:33.581 --> 11:35.548
Why?

11:35.549 --> 11:37.383
Prophecy.

11:37.384 --> 11:39.852
It is written: "In the time
of the tearing of the veil,

11:39.853 --> 11:41.853
"should the son of Brennidon
seek the sacred stone,

11:41.854 --> 11:46.591
he will find it, only to deliver
it to the enemy of light."

11:51.563 --> 11:54.297
The Prelate believes the enemy
of the light is the Keeper

11:54.298 --> 11:55.431
and that this prophecy means

11:55.432 --> 11:56.966
you'll fail in your
quest to defeat him.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.500
You don't agree.

11:58.501 --> 11:59.834
Some of us believe
it's a pretense

11:59.835 --> 12:00.969
for holding you here,

12:00.970 --> 12:03.037
and that the beloved
leader of our order

12:03.038 --> 12:05.572
has become a zealot.

12:05.573 --> 12:06.806
Sister Brenna thought so.

12:06.807 --> 12:09.541
She argued that we should
tell you the truth,

12:09.542 --> 12:12.210
but she never got the chance.

12:12.211 --> 12:14.512
You believe the Prelate
killed her?

12:22.387 --> 12:25.055
Creeping elder
kills quickly.

12:25.056 --> 12:28.290
The Prelate greeted me
at the back of this room.

12:28.291 --> 12:31.926
She didn't get close enough
to Brenna to deliver the poison.

12:31.927 --> 12:34.828
All I know is that Sister Brenna
spoke out against the Prelate

12:34.829 --> 12:36.763
and now Brenna's dead.

12:36.764 --> 12:39.133
I have to get out of here.

12:41.972 --> 12:44.509
Is there a way to do that
without the han killing me?

12:44.510 --> 12:47.878
If you wore a rada'han,
it would suppress your powers,

12:47.879 --> 12:49.547
and in turn,
your headaches.

12:49.548 --> 12:51.315
Do you have one?
No.

12:51.316 --> 12:52.816
But the Prelate does.

12:52.817 --> 12:55.351
She keeps it locked up.

12:55.352 --> 12:57.219
It may take me a few days
before I have the chance,

12:57.220 --> 12:58.454
but I'll try to bring
it for you.

12:58.455 --> 13:00.321
A few days here
is a month on the outside.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.823
I'll get it
as soon as I can.

13:02.824 --> 13:07.460
Until then, please, don't let
anyone know that we've spoken.

13:07.461 --> 13:10.028
It could get me killed.

13:22.806 --> 13:23.340
Why did you lie to me?

13:25.242 --> 13:28.077
I want the truth.

13:36.151 --> 13:38.051
Come with me.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.020
<i>"In the time</i>

13:41.021 --> 13:42.854
<i>"of the tearing
of the veil,</i>

13:42.855 --> 13:47.325
"should the son of Brennidon
seek the sacred stone,

13:47.326 --> 13:52.495
he will find it, only to deliver
it to the enemy of the light."

13:52.496 --> 13:54.797
The Creator herself
gives us these prophecies

13:54.798 --> 13:56.532
to guide our actions.

13:56.533 --> 13:59.033
Did the Creator herself
tell you to lie to me?

13:59.034 --> 14:02.837
No.

14:02.838 --> 14:04.306
No, that was my idea.

14:04.307 --> 14:07.743
While I was looking for you
in the New World,

14:07.744 --> 14:09.344
I learned a lot about you,

14:09.345 --> 14:11.513
including how devoted
you were to Kahlan

14:11.514 --> 14:12.581
and your grandfather.

14:12.582 --> 14:15.183
So I sent word
in a Journey Book

14:15.184 --> 14:17.485
suggesting the Prelate
hide the truth

14:17.486 --> 14:18.986
about the time difference.

14:18.987 --> 14:20.186
Why?

14:20.187 --> 14:23.355
Because you have
a greater destiny, Richard.

14:23.356 --> 14:25.757
I believe people
make their own destinies.

14:25.758 --> 14:28.459
Sometimes they
are written for us.

14:33.297 --> 14:35.531
Our scholars have interpreted
this prophecy to mean

14:35.532 --> 14:38.567
that you would
be born in Brennidon.

14:38.568 --> 14:40.268
And you were.

14:45.207 --> 14:46.874
They said that
this prophecy meant

14:46.875 --> 14:49.576
that you would defeat
an evil tyrant.

14:49.577 --> 14:51.177
And you did.

14:52.580 --> 14:53.880
And now they say

14:53.881 --> 14:57.550
that this prophecy means
that if you continue searching

14:57.551 --> 15:00.219
for the Stone of Tears,
you'll find it,

15:00.220 --> 15:02.887
but you will give
it to the Keeper

15:02.888 --> 15:05.022
I would never do that.

15:05.023 --> 15:10.093
And finally, the last and most
important prophecy.

15:10.094 --> 15:12.128
Our scholars have interpreted
this one to mean

15:12.129 --> 15:15.464
that the descendant
of two powerful bloodlines

15:15.465 --> 15:19.334
must fight a powerful new force
after the Keeper is defeated.

15:20.870 --> 15:23.471
That descendant is you.

15:23.472 --> 15:26.707
Even if that's true,
that battle will never happen

15:26.708 --> 15:28.608
if I don't defeat
the Keeper first.

15:28.609 --> 15:30.810
You must leave that quest
to a new Seeker

15:30.811 --> 15:33.112
and prepare for your
next challenge.

15:33.113 --> 15:36.648
I'm not going to let my life
be ruled by someone's

15:36.649 --> 15:38.450
interpretations of some
carvings on a wall.

15:38.451 --> 15:40.819
Because of these carvings

15:40.820 --> 15:42.787
I gave up half my life

15:42.788 --> 15:45.289
just to bring you here.

15:45.290 --> 15:48.760
And if I stay I'm giving up
the love of my life.

15:48.761 --> 15:50.828
The harder you study,

15:50.829 --> 15:53.263
the faster you'll learn
to use your power,

15:53.264 --> 15:56.532
and the sooner you'll
get back to those you love.

16:21.758 --> 16:23.592
What do we do
with horse thieves?

16:23.593 --> 16:26.261
I'm not a horse thief,
I'm a blacksmith.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.464
This is the man
we've spent the last month

16:30.465 --> 16:32.499
crossing three rivers,

16:32.500 --> 16:33.667
two mountain ranges,

16:33.668 --> 16:35.768
and the great swamp
of Mathragon to find.

16:35.769 --> 16:38.436
This is the man I saw
in Shota's vision.

16:38.437 --> 16:41.268
Then why was he skulking
around our horses?

16:41.269 --> 16:44.168
I was going to the stream
to get some water for my forge

16:44.169 --> 16:47.969
when I noticed one of your
horses was favoring a leg.

16:47.970 --> 16:49.470
Look, if you don't
get that pebble

16:49.471 --> 16:50.871
out of her hoof,
she'll go lame.

16:50.872 --> 16:52.773
He's telling the truth.

16:52.774 --> 16:54.507
Of course he's telling
the truth.

16:54.508 --> 16:57.510
He's the next Seeker of Truth.

17:02.615 --> 17:04.348
So it's true then?

17:04.349 --> 17:06.284
You knew you'd be the Seeker?

17:06.285 --> 17:08.987
There's been a legend
in my family for generations

17:08.988 --> 17:11.655
that someday one of our line
would be named.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.157
My mother was always
sure it would be me.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.659
Did did Richard Cypher die?

17:16.660 --> 17:19.361
No. He's alive.

17:19.362 --> 17:22.396
He just had to take
a long journey.

17:22.397 --> 17:23.932
We're not sure
when he'll come back.

17:32.541 --> 17:34.575
<i>This is The Book
of Counted Shadows.</i>

17:34.576 --> 17:38.145
Only a true Seeker
can read it.

17:42.248 --> 17:46.917
<i>The truth of the words of
The Book of Counted Shadows</i>

17:46.918 --> 17:48.985
can only be insured
by a Confessor.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.890
Sorry about your neck.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.861
Leo Dane,

17:59.862 --> 18:02.662
though the road will be long
and the outcome unknown,

18:02.663 --> 18:05.698
will you undertake
this journey?

18:05.699 --> 18:07.365
I will.

18:07.366 --> 18:08.800
Will you leave
behind your friends

18:08.801 --> 18:10.767
and all that you have known?

18:12.303 --> 18:14.003
I will.

18:14.004 --> 18:15.972
And though the forces
of evil are sworn

18:15.973 --> 18:17.740
to bring about your death,

18:17.741 --> 18:20.243
still, will you go on?

18:20.244 --> 18:22.678
I will.

18:22.679 --> 18:23.946
And will you accept

18:23.947 --> 18:25.848
the name of the Seeker?

18:25.849 --> 18:28.952
I will.

18:42.198 --> 18:44.066
Then I,

18:44.067 --> 18:48.070
First Wizard
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander,

18:48.071 --> 18:49.538
so name you.

19:09.461 --> 19:11.031
Only in the hands of the Seeker

19:11.032 --> 19:12.166
will the compass guide the way

19:12.167 --> 19:15.038
to the Stone of Tears.

19:15.039 --> 19:16.072
We head south.

19:20.778 --> 19:21.878
Can I give you a hand?

19:26.783 --> 19:27.917
You'll soon learn that it's we

19:27.918 --> 19:32.319
who are here
to help you, Seeker.

19:35.989 --> 19:38.357
Trying to show chivalry
to a Mord-Sith

19:38.358 --> 19:39.791
is like trying
to dance with a bear.

19:39.792 --> 19:41.492
It's never gonna work

19:41.493 --> 19:43.962
and someone will get
their head bitten off.

19:50.868 --> 19:52.302
Something's spooking her.

19:54.672 --> 19:56.639
Easy, easy, easy.

20:07.816 --> 20:09.417
Banelings.

21:15.047 --> 21:17.615
Who are these people?
And why did they attack us?

21:17.616 --> 21:19.548
They're banelings.

21:19.549 --> 21:22.716
Dead souls who bargain with
the Keeper for a second life

21:22.717 --> 21:24.151
in exchange for killing others.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.619
How do we make sure they don't
come back from the dead

21:27.620 --> 21:28.619
a second time?

21:28.620 --> 21:30.217
We burn them.

21:40.189 --> 21:42.188
I told you you were
gonna need our help.

21:48.729 --> 21:52.564
The Grace represents
the whole of everything.

21:52.565 --> 21:56.400
Separating the world of life
from the Underworld

21:56.401 --> 21:58.602
is the veil.

21:58.603 --> 22:00.004
Which has been torn.

22:00.005 --> 22:01.472
And while the Keeper

22:01.473 --> 22:04.375
is threatening
to destroy all life,

22:04.376 --> 22:06.443
here I am drawing shapes
with sand.

22:06.444 --> 22:08.445
We've been at this
for three days.

22:08.446 --> 22:10.180
I thought you would teach
me to use my powers.

22:10.181 --> 22:11.781
Patience.

22:11.782 --> 22:14.617
The Grace is the foundation
of everything you need to know.

22:14.618 --> 22:16.751
What exactly are you
trying to teach me?

22:16.752 --> 22:18.419
How to be a Wizard?

22:18.420 --> 22:19.819
Or how to be the Prelate's
disciple?

22:19.820 --> 22:22.922
Your stubborn resistance is only
gonna make this take longer.

22:25.558 --> 22:26.958
Excuse the interruption,

22:26.959 --> 22:28.993
but I was asked to bring
Richard his lunch.

22:28.994 --> 22:31.795
Thank you, Sister Nicci.

22:36.801 --> 22:38.635
Yes, thank you, Sister Nicci.

22:39.637 --> 22:41.104
Shall we continue?

23:00.223 --> 23:01.690
How can I ever thank you?

23:01.691 --> 23:03.057
You must hurry.

23:03.058 --> 23:04.225
It's only a matter of time

23:04.226 --> 23:06.593
before the Prelate
discovers it's missing.

23:06.594 --> 23:09.529
Leave through the vestibule
at the west end of the palace.

23:09.530 --> 23:12.665
It's rarely used and far
from the Sisters' quarters.

23:12.666 --> 23:14.967
Will you be all right?

23:14.968 --> 23:18.136
We'll all be better off
once you're back on your quest.

23:18.137 --> 23:19.804
Now, go.

23:50.834 --> 23:53.100
You're not going anywhere.

24:31.496 --> 24:32.763
How did you get the rada'han?

24:36.500 --> 24:38.167
I'm the Seeker.

24:38.168 --> 24:39.635
I find things.

24:39.636 --> 24:42.503
The only way you could have
known I even had a rada'han

24:42.504 --> 24:44.572
is if one of the Sisters
told you.

24:44.573 --> 24:46.240
How did you find me?

24:46.241 --> 24:48.775
I'm 600 years old, Richard.

24:48.776 --> 24:50.976
Not much gets past me.

24:50.977 --> 24:52.878
I discovered the rada'han
was missing

24:52.879 --> 24:55.014
and I told the Prelate
right away.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.582
I erected a magical barrier

24:56.583 --> 24:58.483
over every exit in the palace.

24:58.484 --> 25:00.151
So now I'm your prisoner?

25:00.152 --> 25:01.718
You've read the Prophecy
for yourself.

25:01.719 --> 25:03.355
You've seen it with
your own eyes.

25:03.356 --> 25:05.157
Well, I must have missed
the part that said,

25:05.158 --> 25:07.493
"Richard Cypher will be held
in the Palace of the Prophets

25:07.494 --> 25:08.694
against his will."

25:08.695 --> 25:11.830
Richard, I want to show
you the ugly truth

25:11.831 --> 25:14.065
about whichever Sister
is helping you.

25:14.066 --> 25:15.566
What are you talking about?

25:20.072 --> 25:23.941
Each candle represents
one Sister in the palace.

25:23.942 --> 25:27.612
As the soul seeks the dark,
so does the flame.

25:31.013 --> 25:33.813
The green flames represent
the sisters of the Dark.

25:34.718 --> 25:36.618
Who secretly serve the Keeper.

25:36.619 --> 25:40.120
One of them is obviously
pretending to be your friend.

25:40.121 --> 25:42.455
Why would these Sisters
of the Dark do that?

25:42.456 --> 25:44.089
Because they want you
to leave the palace,

25:44.090 --> 25:46.258
find the Stone of Tears
and deliver it to the Keeper,

25:46.259 --> 25:47.993
just as the Prophecy
says you will.

25:49.863 --> 25:50.796
Nicci?

25:56.569 --> 25:57.502
Yes, Prelate?

26:00.038 --> 26:03.339
Please see Richard
to his room.

26:03.340 --> 26:05.442
Make sure he doesn't
get any uninvited guests.

26:17.084 --> 26:18.818
Whose side are you on?

26:18.819 --> 26:20.586
I tried to help you.

26:20.587 --> 26:22.921
So I can get back on my quest,
find the sacred stone

26:22.922 --> 26:24.322
and give it to the enemy
of the light?

26:24.323 --> 26:27.256
Are the Prelate's
powers of persuasion

26:27.257 --> 26:28.924
so compelling that even
the Seeker of Truth

26:28.925 --> 26:31.660
will succumb
to her manipulations?

26:31.661 --> 26:34.195
How do I know she's the one
manipulating me?

26:36.130 --> 26:38.831
All she had to do was turn one
word from "light" to "dark"

26:38.832 --> 26:41.567
and claim there's
a conspiracy against her,

26:41.568 --> 26:44.002
and you-- You believed her?

26:44.003 --> 26:46.871
And you stopped
believing in yourself.

26:46.872 --> 26:48.640
I believe in myself, Nicci.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.308
It's you I'm not sure about.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.676
I risked my life for you.

26:52.677 --> 26:54.010
Where are you going?

26:54.011 --> 26:56.912
If the Prelate is going
to accuse anyone

26:56.913 --> 26:59.814
who disagrees with her
of serving the Keeper,

26:59.815 --> 27:02.248
then it's far more
dangerous than I thought.

27:02.249 --> 27:03.916
Who-- Who will she
accuse next?

27:03.917 --> 27:05.784
The cook because
the roast was burnt?

27:05.785 --> 27:10.425
Or the groundskeeper because
he trimmed the hedges too low?

27:10.426 --> 27:13.898
If I stay here, I will
end up like Sister Brenna.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.202
Is there another way
to get out?

27:29.579 --> 27:30.712
There might be.

27:30.713 --> 27:31.780
Tell me.

27:33.716 --> 27:36.784
Aside from being able
to sense someone's han,

27:36.785 --> 27:39.685
the Sisters of Light
can also take it.

27:39.686 --> 27:41.853
Take it how?

27:41.854 --> 27:44.857
We can kill someone
with the Dacra,

27:44.858 --> 27:46.694
and use it to absorb their han,

27:46.695 --> 27:49.629
or accept the gift from
someone who chooses

27:49.630 --> 27:51.731
to relinquish it willingly.

27:51.732 --> 27:53.698
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

27:53.699 --> 27:55.733
Because the rada'han
was a safer way.

27:55.734 --> 27:58.068
Taking someone's han
could kill me.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.271
It could also make you
very powerful.

28:03.842 --> 28:06.644
Yes.

28:06.645 --> 28:09.547
Powerful enough to break through
the Prelate's barriers

28:09.548 --> 28:11.215
and help you escape.

28:11.216 --> 28:14.985
How do I know this wasn't
your plan all along?

28:14.986 --> 28:17.254
Slowly gain my trust
and then steal my power.

28:19.190 --> 28:22.192
I told you,

28:22.193 --> 28:23.393
if I wanted your power

28:23.394 --> 28:25.762
I could just kill you
and take it.

28:28.933 --> 28:31.734
I have to go before
they catch me talking to you.

28:36.238 --> 28:37.338
The choice is yours.

28:37.339 --> 28:41.173
Trust me and escape

28:41.174 --> 28:44.240
or stay here until
they decide to let you out.

28:58.418 --> 29:01.086
Sister Philomena
sent word by Journey Book.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.454
She's crossed to the New World

29:02.455 --> 29:04.889
and she's already
on the new Seeker's trail.

29:04.890 --> 29:06.890
He'll be dead before
he's gripped the Sword of Truth

29:06.891 --> 29:08.958
long enough to warm its hilt.

29:08.959 --> 29:11.461
Very good, Ulicia.

29:11.462 --> 29:12.495
And Richard?

29:14.498 --> 29:16.699
It's only a matter of time

29:16.700 --> 29:18.500
before he's begging me
to take his power,

29:18.501 --> 29:22.237
and once I have it,
I'll free him from the palace

29:22.238 --> 29:26.707
and return him
to his quest...

29:26.708 --> 29:28.675
of failure.

29:28.676 --> 29:32.112
And the Sisters of the Light?

29:32.113 --> 29:34.581
I'll kill the Prelate.

29:34.582 --> 29:36.985
The rest of the Sisters
will be given a choice:

29:36.986 --> 29:40.689
convert to the dark
and serve the Keeper, or die.

29:42.725 --> 29:46.495
Although there
is one small problem.

29:46.496 --> 29:50.099
I've felt the strength
of Richard's han.

29:50.100 --> 29:53.769
It's far greater
than I anticipated.

29:53.770 --> 29:56.872
If I try to absorb it,

29:56.873 --> 29:59.107
the power may overwhelm me.

29:59.108 --> 30:03.278
You should increase your
strength before you take his.

30:03.279 --> 30:07.982
Kill another Sister.
Take her han.

30:07.983 --> 30:12.486
Sisters of the Dark
think alike, Ulicia.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.768
I'll take over your watch
so you can get some sleep.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.470
I'm not tired.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.673
Considering how easy it was for
me to sneak up on you just now,

30:42.674 --> 30:44.141
obviously you need some rest.

30:44.142 --> 30:47.579
It would be impossible
for you to sneak up on me.

30:56.787 --> 30:58.287
So,

30:58.288 --> 30:59.989
Cara.

30:59.990 --> 31:02.590
Yes, Leo?

31:05.861 --> 31:07.428
Do you like animals?

31:07.429 --> 31:09.329
Ones that taste good.

31:09.330 --> 31:11.998
I meant,
do you like pets?

31:14.334 --> 31:16.802
I once had a dog.

31:16.803 --> 31:18.003
I like dogs.

31:19.239 --> 31:21.406
I trained it to attack
on command.

31:23.042 --> 31:25.843
I could see how that
could be useful.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.713
Could you train a chipmunk?

31:32.182 --> 31:33.549
What are you talking about?

31:33.550 --> 31:36.518
To obey your orders?
Attack people?

31:37.954 --> 31:40.588
It's probably too hard, right?

31:40.589 --> 31:43.457
Ah, the mighty chipmunk.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.825
It's fearless.

31:44.826 --> 31:45.859
Cunning.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.393
Stalwart.

31:47.394 --> 31:48.728
And sworn enemy
of the Mord-Sith.

31:48.729 --> 31:51.363
Not even the touch of the Agiel

31:51.364 --> 31:54.065
can break its tiny
but heroic heart.

31:55.634 --> 31:58.469
So you do have
a sense of humor.

32:01.039 --> 32:02.472
You were right.

32:02.473 --> 32:03.640
What about?

32:03.641 --> 32:05.275
If I'm laughing at your
ridiculous jokes,

32:05.276 --> 32:07.544
I must be tired.

32:07.545 --> 32:09.412
I should get some sleep.

32:09.413 --> 32:10.746
Sleep well.

32:10.747 --> 32:12.614
And don't worry.

32:12.615 --> 32:14.215
I'll protect you
from the chipmunks.

32:19.819 --> 32:22.154
I've never heard you
laugh before.

32:24.123 --> 32:26.124
Aren't you supposed
to be asleep?

32:40.236 --> 32:43.004
Well, I'm glad to see you
at devotions.

32:43.005 --> 32:45.806
Having the Creator on your side
certainly can't hurt

32:45.807 --> 32:48.008
when it comes to learning
to use your gift.

32:50.011 --> 32:53.413
In time, I'm confident
you'll learn to appreciate

32:53.414 --> 32:55.749
the Palace of the Prophets
as much as I do.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.984
Maybe so.

33:01.689 --> 33:04.858
It is customary to kiss
the star before opening it.

33:27.276 --> 33:28.310
Ready for your lesson?

33:28.311 --> 33:29.844
The lessons are over.

33:32.447 --> 33:35.082
A Sister of the Dark
has agreed to absorb my han,

33:35.083 --> 33:37.950
use the power to blast
through the Prelate's barrier,

33:37.951 --> 33:39.051
and set me free.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.059
Is this a joke?

33:47.060 --> 33:49.628
Oh, I'm very serious.

33:49.629 --> 33:51.830
Who's helping you?

33:51.831 --> 33:53.665
All I can say is that
once this is done,

33:53.666 --> 33:57.935
the person I'm leaving behind
will be very powerful.

33:57.936 --> 34:01.070
She'll probably kill all
the Sisters of the Light.

34:01.071 --> 34:04.140
How kind of you to warn me.

34:05.809 --> 34:07.409
But I'm afraid
I can't let you do this.

34:07.410 --> 34:09.476
Looking for this?

34:09.478 --> 34:11.946
The choice is yours:

34:11.947 --> 34:13.847
help me with what I need to do
to prevent this woman

34:13.848 --> 34:15.081
from killing everyone,

34:15.083 --> 34:18.284
or stay here gagged and tied up
while I escape anyway.

34:18.284 --> 34:21.853
Either way, I'm getting free.

34:21.855 --> 34:25.357
In one instance
the Sisters will be safe.

34:25.358 --> 34:27.993
In the other,
they'll probably be slaughtered.

34:30.963 --> 34:33.764
I've gotten
to know you Richard.

34:33.766 --> 34:36.167
You would never leave innocent
women at the mercy of a monster.

34:36.168 --> 34:39.536
I'd hardly call the Sisters
of the Light innocent women.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.371
You've lied to me,
held me captive,

34:42.371 --> 34:45.706
and separated me from the people
I love most in the world.

34:47.608 --> 34:49.041
But worst of all,

34:49.042 --> 34:51.943
you've used your piety
as an excuse

34:51.944 --> 34:53.478
to take away my freedom.

34:53.478 --> 34:56.813
Everything I've done, I've done
with the best intentions.

34:56.815 --> 34:59.849
I don't need training to tell
you Wizard's Second Rule:

34:59.850 --> 35:04.320
the greatest harm can result
from the best intentions.

35:32.578 --> 35:36.179
Is the air putting up
much of a fight?

35:36.180 --> 35:39.015
Well, I could use
a sparring partner.

35:39.016 --> 35:41.150
Mord-Siths don't spar.

35:41.151 --> 35:44.987
When we fight,
we fight to inflict pain.

35:48.892 --> 35:50.626
Someone just tried to kill you.

36:10.881 --> 36:13.049
Who are you and why are you
trying to kill me?

36:13.050 --> 36:14.716
I'm not telling you anything.

36:14.717 --> 36:16.617
Feeling a little shy today?

36:16.618 --> 36:18.951
I can help you
find your courage.

36:22.021 --> 36:23.922
What's going on here?

36:23.923 --> 36:26.358
This woman just tried
to kill Leo.

36:26.359 --> 36:28.794
Perhaps you can compel her
to explain why.

36:47.543 --> 36:51.478
Can you bring her back
with the Breath of Life?

36:54.982 --> 36:57.383
No.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.784
She's severed her windpipe.

36:58.785 --> 37:02.486
Why would a Sister of the Light
want to kill Leo?

37:02.487 --> 37:04.522
Something must be terribly wrong
within their order.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.625
Richard's with them.

37:09.626 --> 37:10.626
He could be in danger.

37:10.627 --> 37:12.128
I have to find him.

37:12.129 --> 37:13.829
I'll go with you.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.731
What about the Stone of Tears?

37:15.732 --> 37:17.799
He's right.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.801
We shouldn't all go.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.002
I'll stay with Leo.

37:21.003 --> 37:23.204
You try to pick up
Richard's trail.

37:25.340 --> 37:27.040
Are you sure you
want to do this?

37:27.041 --> 37:28.842
Yes.

37:30.811 --> 37:32.077
Place your palms on mine,

37:34.947 --> 37:36.515
close your eyes,

37:38.117 --> 37:39.651
and surrender yourself to me.

37:54.387 --> 37:56.354
Say the words with me:

38:47.932 --> 38:50.968
Now the Sisters won't be able
to follow you.

38:53.137 --> 38:55.037
All that power.

38:55.038 --> 38:56.038
Useless.

38:56.039 --> 38:58.273
Richard, help me.

38:58.274 --> 38:59.808
You are a Sister of the Dark,
Nicci.

38:59.809 --> 39:00.809
And so is Ulicia.

39:00.810 --> 39:02.210
That's not true.

39:02.211 --> 39:03.545
At first I wasn't sure,

39:03.546 --> 39:04.980
but then I realized:

39:04.981 --> 39:06.982
<i>you're the one who passes
out the hymn books.</i>

39:06.983 --> 39:08.651
You killed Sister Brenna

39:08.652 --> 39:10.453
by rubbing
creeping elder on hers.

39:10.454 --> 39:12.554
<i>She was poisoned
when she kissed it.</i>

39:12.555 --> 39:14.055
Why would I kill Brenna?

39:14.056 --> 39:16.490
To make me suspicious
of the Prelate.

39:16.491 --> 39:18.424
That's absurd.
Ulicia put the hymn book

39:18.425 --> 39:21.093
<i>with the body so the poison
wouldn't be discovered.</i>

39:21.094 --> 39:24.660
She also alerted the Prelate
that the rada'han was missing

39:24.661 --> 39:25.760
so I'd be captured.

39:25.761 --> 39:28.030
If we wanted you
out of the palace,

39:28.031 --> 39:29.767
why would we
want you captured?

39:29.768 --> 39:32.103
Because you needed me to believe
that the only way out

39:32.104 --> 39:34.639
was to let you take my powers.

39:41.779 --> 39:43.180
Get him.

39:49.753 --> 39:52.421
Your han isn't as strong
as the woman

39:52.422 --> 39:53.788
who put up this barrier.

39:53.789 --> 39:55.657
You can't take
it down so easily.

39:55.658 --> 39:59.660
Richard, don't go.

39:59.661 --> 40:02.963
Don't you see, you'll only
be serving the Keeper?

40:02.964 --> 40:06.365
I don't believe
in prophecies.

40:06.366 --> 40:09.001
You're a lost soul if you have
nothing to believe in, Richard.

40:10.369 --> 40:12.403
I believe in myself.

40:12.404 --> 40:13.671
And the people I love.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.473
Well, it's only a matter of time
before he finds the stone

40:35.474 --> 40:36.539
and gives it to the Keeper.

40:36.540 --> 40:39.765
Just like the Prophecy says.

40:39.766 --> 40:42.666
I wouldn't underestimate him
if I were you.

40:42.667 --> 40:44.568
He's full of surprises.

41:05.287 --> 41:06.718
Sister, what's happening?

41:11.356 --> 41:14.191
A new prophecy.

41:14.192 --> 41:17.127
That hasn't happened
in a thousand years.

41:19.530 --> 41:22.866
"As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

41:22.867 --> 41:27.103
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

41:39.047 --> 41:40.614
Lesson Number 88, Seeker:

41:40.615 --> 41:44.583
"Growling bellies make for
unhappy traveling companions."

41:44.584 --> 41:46.117
You want to stop and eat?

41:48.487 --> 41:49.820
Kahlan.

41:49.821 --> 41:50.988
Cara.

41:50.989 --> 41:52.255
What are you doing here?

41:52.256 --> 41:53.523
We were heading south,

41:53.524 --> 41:56.859
but then the compass
suddenly changed direction

41:56.860 --> 41:57.993
and it led us here.

41:57.994 --> 42:00.229
If the compass led you to us,

42:00.230 --> 42:03.465
and we're traveling
towards Richard, then--

42:06.236 --> 42:08.470
Then the compass must
be guiding us all back to him.
