Yeah, that's where you
made the most connections,

08:17.984 --> 08:19.768
I feel, like, especially with kids.

08:19.793 --> 08:21.885
They became like a
part of your childhood.

08:21.988 --> 08:25.256
Was Mr. Clean ever anybody's favorite?

08:25.358 --> 08:26.315
Did you... Oh. Hoho.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.997
He was respected in our house.

08:28.022 --> 08:30.432
Like, that's your mom's
corporate pitch man.

08:30.457 --> 08:32.763
Originally, he was meant to be a sailor.

08:32.865 --> 08:34.097
Yeah, but he doesn't look like a sailor.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.393
I always thought he was a genie.

08:35.418 --> 08:36.876
Me too. It was more like, you know,

08:36.900 --> 08:38.645
"I am the genie of the
lamp" kind of genie.

08:38.671 --> 08:40.337
Sorta looks like
Popeye. Don't you think?

08:40.438 --> 08:43.289
What about the... the huge
under bite that Popeye had?

08:43.315 --> 08:44.765
I think he looks nothing
like Popeye, actually.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.479
Well, he's not a
cartoon, but he's right.

08:46.511 --> 08:49.910
He is kind of like a
smooth sailor with...

08:49.935 --> 08:51.458
Well, Popeye didn't have an earring.

08:51.483 --> 08:53.417
And he is wearing a T...
He's nothing like Popeye.

08:53.519 --> 08:54.618
[laughter]

08:54.720 --> 08:56.353
I was trying to help, Zap, but

08:56.455 --> 08:58.589
there's... there's
nothing Popeye about him.

08:58.691 --> 09:01.427
You know, I would put Mr.
Clean up there on the pantheon

09:01.452 --> 09:04.445
of recognizable advertising
characters in the hall of fame.

09:04.470 --> 09:05.362
He's definitely in there.

09:05.464 --> 09:06.613
Who else is in that hall of fame?

09:06.638 --> 09:08.543
I mean, uh, you know,
Chef Boyardee maybe?

09:08.668 --> 09:09.733
Absolutely.

09:09.835 --> 09:10.934
Rice Krispies guys.

09:11.037 --> 09:12.369

09:12.471 --> 09:14.138

09:20.579 --> 09:21.587

09:21.612 --> 09:23.213
Well, um, I have a confession.

09:23.316 --> 09:25.360
I used to have a little
crush on Mr. Clean

09:25.385 --> 09:26.350
when I was younger.

09:26.487 --> 09:28.281
And a girlfriend of mine saw this

09:28.306 --> 09:29.553
and gave it to me as a gift.

09:29.655 --> 09:30.776
But not anymore.

09:30.801 --> 09:32.489
No, I think it's time for him to go.

09:32.591 --> 09:34.072

09:34.097 --> 09:36.196
- a-any advertising spokesmen?
- [laughter]

09:36.414 --> 09:38.530
Hey, other people have
a thing for Batman.

09:38.555 --> 09:41.498
He's just... he fights, you
know, grime instead of crime.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.434
all: Ooh!

09:43.536 --> 09:44.351
[laughs]

09:44.376 --> 09:45.803
You've... We've all just been poned.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.493

- Badly.

09:47.518 --> 09:48.405
I'm sorry.

09:48.507 --> 09:51.293
Do you consider Mr. Clean a superhero?

09:51.457 --> 09:52.676
[laughter]

09:52.778 --> 09:55.245
Maybe he's better at
cleaning than Batman.

09:55.348 --> 09:56.814
Batman, you know,

09:56.916 --> 09:58.475
he's one... part of the one percenters?

09:58.500 --> 09:59.368
and someone's always been

09:59.393 --> 10:00.845
cleaning up for him like Alfred,

10:00.870 --> 10:03.728
but when has Mr. Clean
ever showed an interest

10:03.767 --> 10:06.323

anywhere beyond the kitchen?

10:06.425 --> 10:07.232

Like, "Mr. Clean, there's
a mugging outside."

He's like, "Yeah, but
this floor is really dirty.

10:11.130 --> 10:12.596

where are we gonna put it?

14:54.940 --> 14:56.506

14:56.608 --> 14:57.824
We don't have anything that big,

14:57.849 --> 14:59.749
so it'd have to be out on the floor.

touching it and breaking it.

a little bit for you,

18:09.908 --> 18:14.049
Um, Captain Marvel was
diagnosed with inoperable cancer.

18:14.074 --> 18:16.742
And this story is about how a hero,

18:16.844 --> 18:18.243
you know, faces his final battle,

18:18.345 --> 18:19.878
and there's not a villain in the book.

It made you see comic

18:23.884 --> 18:25.449

18:25.474 --> 18:28.230
A lot of superheroes have

18:28.255 --> 18:30.155

18:30.257 --> 18:32.491
has ever been more
poignant and more honorable.

18:32.593 --> 18:33.722
And brave too.

18:33.747 --> 18:36.071
To even step up to
the table and be like,

18:36.096 --> 18:37.729
"Hey, comic books are for kids,

18:37.831 --> 18:39.747
and I want to do a story about cancer."

18:39.779 --> 18:41.099
But Jim Starlin showed you

18:41.201 --> 18:43.813
that this medium could do a lot more

18:43.838 --> 18:45.529
than just like, "We're
fighting each other.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.677

18:46.702 --> 18:48.584
'Cause it's a powerful
piece of writing, man.

18:48.609 --> 18:51.101

other Captain Marvels.

18:53.996 --> 18:56.358

Marvel, he had the greatest hair

19:06.881 --> 19:07.700
