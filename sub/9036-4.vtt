WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:09.443
- OH, NO.
- WHAT IS IT?

00:09.477 --> 00:11.645
- I WAS DAYDREAMING,
AND NOW I CAN'T REMEMBER

00:11.679 --> 00:14.748
IF I SHAMPOOED MY HAIR OR NOT.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.318
- SO?
DO IT AGAIN.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.819
- I CAN'T,
'CAUSE IF I'VE WASHED IT ALREADY

00:18.852 --> 00:20.154
AND DO IT AGAIN,

00:20.188 --> 00:22.390
MY HAIR'S GOING TO BE
TOO FLUFFY.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.625
- SO DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.294
- WELL, WHAT IF I DIDN'T DO IT?

00:26.327 --> 00:27.595
THEN IT'S GOING TO BE TOO OILY.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.265
WHAT?
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.833
- OH, YEAH,
IT'S A REAL CRISIS.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.236
YOU WANT ME TO CALL IN SICK
FOR YOU TODAY, RAY?

00:35.269 --> 00:36.604
- WELL, I'M WEIRD.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.272
HEY, HOW ABOUT THE TIME
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUTSIDE

00:38.306 --> 00:41.809
'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOUR HAIRCUT
MADE YOUR BUTT LOOK FAT?

00:44.145 --> 00:46.180
I'M THE WEIRD ONE, RIGHT?

00:46.214 --> 00:48.149
[yells]

00:48.182 --> 00:51.385
[glass breaks]
OW.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.856
HI, I'M RAY.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.525
I LIVE HERE IN LONG ISLAND

00:57.558 --> 01:04.232
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA;

01:04.265 --> 01:05.599
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER;

01:05.633 --> 01:11.439
AND TWIN
ALMOST-TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.274
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:13.307 --> 01:20.414
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:20.448 --> 01:23.384
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR MY FAMILY.

01:26.154 --> 01:36.197
AND DONE.

01:36.197 --> 01:41.902
AND DONE.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.738
- SO ALL THREE KIDS ARE DOWN.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.574
FREE AT LAST,
FREE AT LAST.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.710
THANK GOD ALMIGHTY,
I'M FREE AT LAST.

01:49.743 --> 01:53.647
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE
ALL ABOUT ME.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.684
ME, ME, ME.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.686
HOW'S IT GOING, FLUFFY?

02:00.954 --> 02:03.424
- NOT GOOD.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.160
COME ON, WHAT IS THIS
HEALTH INSURANCE?

02:06.194 --> 02:08.829
MATCHING THE DOCTOR BILLS
TO THE WORKSHEETS,

02:08.862 --> 02:10.631
WHO PAID WHO, WHAT, WHEN?

02:10.664 --> 02:14.735
NO, THIS--
THIS HAS TO BE WOMAN'S WORK.

02:14.768 --> 02:15.869
- OH, GREAT.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.905
WELL, I'LL JUST DO
SOME MAN'S WORK:

02:17.938 --> 02:20.574
WATCH A LITTLE TV
AND SCRATCH MYSELF.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.613
- AH.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.415
LOOK AT THIS.
I CAN'T MAKE THAT NUMBER OUT.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.583
THAT COULD BE A NINE.
COULD BE A FOUR.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.186
THIS'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.888
WHAT'S ON, HONEY?

02:34.922 --> 02:36.390
- RAY, COME ON.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.226
YOU HAVEN'T WORKED ON THAT
AT ALL.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.427
- YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.961
THE POINT IS...

02:40.994 --> 02:43.697
I WILL RUB YOUR FEET.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.833
- YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO--
YOU GOT TO GET THIS DONE.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.935
- WITH LOTIONS.
COME ON.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.437
I'M NOT EVEN A FOOT PERSON.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.671
MATTER OF FACT,

02:50.704 --> 02:52.906
THE WHOLE IDEA
OF RUBBING FEET MAKES ME SICK.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.477
- JUST SHUT UP AND RUB.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.878
THAT'S TICKLING.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.513
THAT'S NOT RUBBING.
THAT'S TICKLING!

02:59.547 --> 03:00.714
[screeches]

03:00.748 --> 03:03.451
- HEY.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.286
GLAD YOU'RE NOT BUSY.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.923
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE'RE NOT BUSY, ROBERT?

03:09.957 --> 03:12.526
- WELL, I SAW
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.961
- YOU WERE LOOKING?

03:13.994 --> 03:16.797
- WELL, I'M A COP.
IT'S MY TRAINING.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.933
- WELL, YOU KNOW, ROBERT,

03:19.967 --> 03:22.236
IT MAY LOOK LIKE
WE'RE NOT BUSY, BUT...

03:22.270 --> 03:23.737
GET OUT.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.777
- I NEED YOU TO TAKE
AN I.Q. TEST.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.746
- WHAT?
- AN I.Q. TEST.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.914
I'M TAKING
A CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY CLASS

03:33.947 --> 03:35.416
TO MAKE LIEUTENANT,

03:35.449 --> 03:38.952
AND I HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO GIVE AN I.Q. TEST.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.654
- I--

03:40.688 --> 03:43.757
I THINK HE WANTS ME
TO STEAL THIRD.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.829
- HAVE I EVER ASKED YOU FOR
ANYTHING, RAYMOND?

03:51.399 --> 03:52.833
- OH--

03:52.866 --> 03:55.769
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
OUT OF MOM'S HOUSE.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.705
- ALL RIGHT.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.841
YEAH, JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.510
- OH, GOD.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.879
WE HAVE TO.
I MEAN, IT'S FOR HIS CLASS.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.850
- JUST KEEP TALKING.
HE'S ALMOST GONE.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.952
- WE'LL DO IT, ROBERT.
- NO.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.621
THREE MORE STEPS.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.389
- YOU'LL DO IT?
- YEAH.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.790
- OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.592
THIS REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME.

04:18.626 --> 04:19.693
- BUT, LISTEN,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO--

04:19.727 --> 04:20.961
- THERE'S NO TALKING.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.998
NOW, I'LL BE TESTING YOU
ONE-ON-ONE

04:25.032 --> 04:26.600
FOR EACH SECTION.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.602
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.471
I HAVE TO TREAT YOU
BOTH THE SAME.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.072
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO CHITCHAT.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.542
AND I'VE GOT TO BE
STONE-FACED.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.645
- THERE'S A STRETCH.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.713
- AGAIN, NO TALKING.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.550
- SO, UH, WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO DO THIS, ROBERT?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.452
- I THOUGHT WE COULD START
WITH YOU IN THE BASEMENT,

04:44.485 --> 04:45.586
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DEBRA.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.487
- HOW COME YOU DIDN'T SNAP--

04:46.520 --> 04:47.721
- NO TALKING!

05:08.576 --> 05:11.011
- ... UP TO 40 MILES PER HOUR.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.012
- HOW BAD IS IT?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.313
- HUP, HUP, HUP, HUP, HUP, HUP!

05:16.584 --> 05:17.885
- HOW'D YOU DO?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.453
- I THINK I DID REALLY WELL.
IT'S PRETTY EASY.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.455
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.756
GIVE ME SOME ANSWERS.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.527
- I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CARE.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.029
- I DON'T.
- WELL?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.931
- GIVE ME SOME ANSWERS.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.800
- NO.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.403
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.570
OKAY, THAT'S HOW
IT'S GOING TO BE?

05:36.604 --> 05:38.506
- WELL, I'M NOT CHEATING.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.807
- WHAT?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.710
- I'M NOT CHEATING.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.744
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.379
- NO TALKING, DEBRA.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.988
- THAT WOULD BE
THE MAGNA CARTA.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.559
DID DEBRA GET THAT?

05:58.592 --> 06:01.562
I'D BET DEBRA DIDN'T GET
THAT ONE.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.096
- WHO INVENTED
THE COTTON GIN?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.432
- OH, THAT'S EASY.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.934
ELI WALLACH.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.737
WHITNEY! WHITNEY!

06:09.770 --> 06:10.938
ELI WHITNEY.
YOU KNOW WHAT--

06:10.971 --> 06:12.406
I MEANT WHITNEY, ROBERT.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.542
- OKAY, USING THESE BLOCKS,

06:14.575 --> 06:17.545
PLEASE RECONSTRUCT
THE FIGURE IN THIS DIAGRAM.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.546
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.713
- YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS.
GO.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.114
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.450
ROBERT, THESE
THREE-DIMENSIONAL BLOCKS,

06:22.483 --> 06:23.717
BUT IT'S A TWO-DIMENSIONAL
DRAWING.

06:23.751 --> 06:24.518
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO--

06:24.552 --> 06:26.987
- TIME.
- TIME.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.789
DON'T TAKE THE BLOCKS.
I WANT THE BLOCKS.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.591
ROBERT, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.826
I WANT MY BLOCKS BACK!

06:46.674 --> 06:48.476
[exhales]

06:54.548 --> 06:55.849
- HOW'D IT GO?

06:55.883 --> 06:58.452
- OH, I THINK I ACED IT.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.156
HOW'D YOU DO ON THE BLOCKS?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.058
- OH, THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.827
HE DIDN'T GIVE ME
ANY TIME AT ALL.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.596
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.963
- I THOUGHT THERE WAS
PLENTY OF TIME.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.503
- HI. IS ROBERT HERE?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.037
- HE'S DOWNSTAIRS, GRADING US.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.506
- AH, YOU SEE?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.641
THEY'RE NOT AFRAID
OF TAKING THE TEST.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.477
- I DON'T WANT
MY BRAIN MEASURED.

07:25.012 --> 07:28.616
IT'S GOTTEN ME THIS FAR.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.819
- FOR SOME REASON, YOUR FATHER
HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.054
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN TESTS.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.624
ALL THEY DO
IS DEAL WITH BOOK SMARTS.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.059
THEY DON'T MEASURE
STREET SMARTS.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.761
- AND YOU'RE STREET SMART?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.796
- I AM VERY STREET SMART.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.732
- [laughing]

07:49.202 --> 07:52.072
HAVE HIM TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME
HE BOUGHT SEAFOOD

07:52.105 --> 07:55.108
OUT OF THE BACK
OF A DERELICT'S CAR.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.910
- HE WAS LEGIT.

07:56.944 --> 08:01.749
- OH, HE HAD THE PRICES
TATTOOED ON HIS BODY.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.119
- ONE BAD MUSSEL
IN A WHOLE BUCKET.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.188
- I THREW UP FOR THREE WEEKS

08:08.221 --> 08:11.191
SO THAT YOU COULD SAVE
79 CENTS?

08:11.224 --> 08:12.826
- THEY WERE DELICIOUS.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.162
YOU COULD TASTE THE OCEAN.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.631
- I'M STILL TASTING IT.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.068
OOH.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.069
- GOOD NIGHT.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.070
- OH, ROBBY.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.805
- WAIT A MINUTE.
HOW'D IT GO?

08:24.838 --> 08:25.606
- I BELIEVE I ADMINISTERED

08:25.639 --> 08:28.275
AND EVALUATED THE TEST
CORRECTLY.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.644
I FEEL I DID PRETTY GOOD.
GOOD NIGHT.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.713
- WHO CARES ABOUT YOU?
TELL US THE SCORES.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.915
- IT'S NOT ABOUT US, RAY.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.050
ROBERT, JUST PLACATE HIM.
TELL HIM THE SCORES.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.719
- PLACATE--

08:38.752 --> 08:43.256
TO APPEASE,
TO MAKE FEEL BETTER.

08:43.290 --> 08:46.059
- THE SCORES
AREN'T REALLY IMPORTANT.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.628
- I KNOW THAT,
BUT YOUR BROTHER SEEMS TO--

08:47.661 --> 08:48.762
- YEAH, BUT I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO--

08:48.796 --> 08:51.632
- TELL US THE SCORES!

08:51.665 --> 08:54.134
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.571
- ALL RIGHT.
RAYMOND, YOU GOT 100.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.872
- 100.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.141
- OH, A PERFECT SCORE!

09:01.174 --> 09:03.343
OOH, THAT'S MY RAYMOND.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.647
THANK GOD YOU GOT
YOUR MOTHER'S BRAINS.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.182
- 100 IS AVERAGE.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.118
- AVERAGE?

09:11.151 --> 09:13.020
HE GOT THAT FROM YOU.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.824
- UH, WHAT DID I GET?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.125
- DEBRA, YOU SCORED 115.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.628
- YES!

09:20.661 --> 09:22.362
WELL, THAT'S CLOSE.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.297
- NO, I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE NOT CLOSE.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.634
15 POINTS IS
ONE STANDARD DEVIATION.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.002
- OH!

09:29.036 --> 09:30.337
- WELL, WHAT'S THAT?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.773
- WELL, THAT MEANS
THAT BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,

09:32.806 --> 09:35.709
WELL, DEBRA'S IN A WHOLE
HIGHER CLASS OF BRAINS.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.579
- HOLY CRAP.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.717
- GOOD NIGHT.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.625
- WELL, I MEAN,
THEY'RE JUST, YOU KNOW,

09:51.659 --> 09:53.694
TEST SCORES, RAY.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.664
IT WAS REALLY ABOUT ROBERT
LEARNING TO GIVE THE TEST.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.831
- YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GOING TO LEARN

09:57.865 --> 10:01.869
THAT YOU'RE SMART
AND I'M AN IDIOT.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.071
- THERE'S MORE THAN
ONE KIND OF INTELLIGENCE, RAY.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.806
- THAT'S RIGHT.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.741
THERE ARE STREET SMARTS!

10:12.245 --> 10:13.981
- ALL RIGHT,
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.248
DON'T FALL
OUT OF YOUR CHAIRS.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.417
OUR STORE IS ON THE INTERNET.
- NO.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.518
- YEAH.

10:18.551 --> 10:22.255
YOU JUST POINT YOUR BROWSER
DOWN TO WWW.BERNIE.COM,

10:22.289 --> 10:24.692
AND THERE I AM,
STRADDLING A JET SKI.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.193
- WHOO!

10:26.226 --> 10:28.996
- OH, BOY, HE LOOKS SO CUTE
IN HIS SPEEDO.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.364
- WELL--
OH, I'M SORRY, RAY.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.966
I'M SURE DEBRA KNOWS
ALL ABOUT THE INTERNET,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.436
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.905
PIZZA HOT.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.107
[laughs]

10:40.140 --> 10:42.109
- YEAH.
- OH!

10:42.142 --> 10:44.812
- YEAH, YEAH.
HAVE YOUR FUN.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.413
- LEAVE HIM ALONE, BERNIE.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.881
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT THE TEST

10:47.915 --> 10:50.083
SO YOU COULD USE IT
AGAINST HIM.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.920
- YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.421
- STOP IT.
LOOK, I DON'T CARE.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.089
I DON'T CARE.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.025
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T CARE.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.327
- CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING, RAY?
LOOK, YOU'RE ALL OUT OF SODA.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.795
- I AM?
- YEAH.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.731
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GO GET YOU ANOTHER ONE.

11:03.764 --> 11:04.998
YOU WANT A LEMON WEDGE?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.333
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT'D BE NICE.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.801
- OKAY.
- I'M GOING TO GET ONE TOO.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.103
- YEAH, I'LL TAKE ONE.
- OH, PLEASE.

11:13.774 --> 11:18.345
WHY IS RAY SO DEPRESSED?
IT WAS JUST A TEST.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.080
- I GUESS SEEING
IN BLACK AND WHITE

11:20.113 --> 11:21.081
THAT I'M SMARTER THAN HIM

11:21.114 --> 11:23.951
JUST BLEW OUT HIS SELF-ESTEEM.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.185
I MEAN, I'M TRYING
TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER,

11:25.218 --> 11:26.920
BUT NOTHING WORKS.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.188
- OH, COME ON.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.057
YOU HAD TO KNOW
YOU WERE SMARTER.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.726
- WELL, OF COURSE, BUT...

11:32.760 --> 11:34.895
I STILL FEEL GUILTY.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.797
- YOU OKAY?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.799
- ARE THEY LOOKING?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.736
- NO. WHY?

11:42.770 --> 11:43.737
- COME HERE.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.942
- WHAT?

11:48.976 --> 11:53.080
- YOU HAVE GOT TO TAKE
THIS TEST!

11:53.113 --> 11:53.881
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.148
- I'M TALKING,

11:55.182 --> 11:58.151
SHE FEELS SO BAD FOR ME,
I GOT IT MADE.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.353
SHE'S GETTING LEMON
IN MY SODA.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.354
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.891
SHE'S DOING EVERYTHING
FOR ME,

12:03.924 --> 12:05.458
INCLUDING...

12:07.560 --> 12:08.996
- NO!

12:09.029 --> 12:11.131
- YES!

12:11.164 --> 12:14.334
OH--

12:14.367 --> 12:16.403
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE RESULTS CAME IN,

12:16.436 --> 12:18.839
AT FIRST I WAS UPSET
BECAUSE I WAS STUPID.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.141
NOW THIS IS THE GREATEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.543
- OH, I GOT TO TAKE THIS TEST.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.813
- YES.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.015
- I JUST HOPE
I'M STUPID ENOUGH.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.282
- DON'T WORRY.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.293
- HOW YOU FEELING?

12:40.327 --> 12:42.062
- OH, YOU KNOW.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.196
- HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.399
- ICE CREAM ON THE COUCH?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.135
- MM-HMM.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.503
- IT'S MY FAVORITE.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.139
NONE FOR YOU?

12:52.172 --> 12:54.007
- THAT WAS THE LAST OF IT, SO...

12:54.041 --> 12:56.409
- OH. SORRY.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.390
- UM, YOU KNOW, HONEY,
I WAS THINKING,

13:10.423 --> 13:12.225
THAT HEALTH INSURANCE
HAS TO BE IN TOMORROW.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.827
DID YOU FINISH IT YET?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.228
- HEALTH INSURANCE?

13:15.262 --> 13:17.364
OH, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.832
I WANT TO.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.301
BUT I'VE JUST BEEN,
YOU KNOW,

13:21.334 --> 13:23.136
SO DOWN.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.376
MAYBE YOU SHOULD--
- WHAT?

13:29.409 --> 13:31.611
- WELL, I MEAN,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT,

13:31.644 --> 13:33.046
AND I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD TRUST IT

13:33.080 --> 13:35.282
TO SOMEBODY LIKE ME.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.888
MMM, FUDGY.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.555
- ALL RIGHT.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.491
ALL RIGHT, THAT IS IT.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.993
YOU KNOW,
AT FIRST I FELT BAD

13:46.026 --> 13:47.294
BECAUSE YOU WERE
SO DEPRESSED,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.262
BUT NOW I THINK YOU'RE
REALLY MILKING IT HERE.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.031
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.266
- OH, WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
I SEE THROUGH THIS?

13:53.300 --> 13:55.135
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:55.168 --> 13:56.603
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU, RAY.

13:56.636 --> 14:01.341
MAKING ME FEEL GUILTY,
YOU LITTLE WEASEL.

14:01.374 --> 14:05.478
- OH, I'M--I'M DEPRESSED AGAIN.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.481
- DO THE HEALTH INSURANCE,
YOU BIG FAKE.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.484
"MMM, FUDGY."
GIVE ME THAT.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.088
- YOU KNOW, I READ SOMEWHERE

14:15.122 --> 14:16.489
WHERE THE HAPPIEST MARRIAGES
ARE THE ONES

14:16.523 --> 14:18.225
WHERE THE MAN IS SMARTER.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.228
- GUESS WHO WROTE THAT.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.097
[doorbell rings]

14:24.131 --> 14:26.366
GET THE DOOR.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.567
IT'S THAT BIG WOODEN THING

14:27.600 --> 14:29.602
WITH THE KNOB
THAT'S NOT YOUR HEAD.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.374
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

14:34.407 --> 14:35.909
I THOUGHT I SAW AN ARGUMENT.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.916
- STOP STALKING US.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.154
- THIS WOULDN'T BE
ABOUT THE, UH...

14:47.187 --> 14:49.256
- NO.
- WOULD IT?

14:49.289 --> 14:51.024
- YEAH, WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.126
- OH, GOOD, 'CAUSE
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

14:53.160 --> 14:56.429
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE,
UH, MADE A MISTAKE

14:56.463 --> 14:59.499
WITH YOUR TEST RESULTS,
JUMBLED THEM.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.202
- WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.504
- WELL, ACTUALLY, RAYMOND,
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SCORED

15:04.537 --> 15:06.373
ONE STANDARD DEVIATION HIGHER
THAN DEBRA.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.208
- WHAT?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.345
- GOOD NIGHT.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.321
- WELL...

15:21.354 --> 15:23.423
NOW IT'S A HAPPY MARRIAGE.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.692
FUDGY.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.341
- NO.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.512
NO.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.217
NO.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.323
NO.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.761
NO, NO, NO.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.170
NOOOOO.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.111
NO.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.481
NO!

16:56.716 --> 16:58.185
- DEBRA.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.489
- YOU HAD TO TELL
YOUR MOTHER

17:02.522 --> 17:04.457
THAT YOU'RE
THE SMARTER ONE.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.825
- SHE'S MY MOTHER.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.227
IF I CAN'T TELL HER,
WHO CAN I TELL?

17:07.260 --> 17:08.361
- YOU TOLD LINDA.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.563
- NO, I DID--
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.564
I WOULD NEVER TELL LINDA.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.466
- THEN YOU TOLD BERNIE.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.535
- WELL, WHO KNEW
HE'D TALK TO HIS WIFE?

17:15.568 --> 17:17.737
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.606
I HAVE BEEN HOLDING THIS IN
ALL DAY.

17:19.639 --> 17:23.776
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT YOU ARE SMARTER THAN ME.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.380
- SMARTER THAN I.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.449
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THE 18TH-CENTURY POET

17:29.482 --> 17:31.451
WHO WROTE
"A MODEST PROPOSAL," HUH?

17:31.484 --> 17:33.253
HUH?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.688
- YEAH, WELL, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF "THE TWILIGHT ZONE"

17:35.722 --> 17:38.158
WHERE THE ASTRONAUTS MEET
THE GIANT LADY?

17:38.191 --> 17:41.428
- OH, PLEASE.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.230
WHO'S THE FIRST WOMAN
TO WIN A NOBEL PRIZE?

17:43.263 --> 17:46.533
- HOW MUCH DOES
MICKEY ROONEY WEIGH ON THE MOON?

17:50.537 --> 17:51.638
- WHAT'S A PETIT FOUR?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.340
- WHAT'S A WEDGIE?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.378
- WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME,

17:58.411 --> 18:00.580
WAS MY HAIR LONG OR SHORT?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.521
- WELL...

18:08.555 --> 18:09.589
I KNOW ONE THING FOR SURE;

18:09.622 --> 18:11.358
IT WAS BLONDE.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.596
OH, THAT WASN'T YOU.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.298
YEAH, BUT I BROKE UP
WITH HER THEN

18:18.331 --> 18:19.666
TO GO OUT WITH YOU.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.137
ALL RIGHT, I'LL JUST SLEEP
ON THE COUCH.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.642
- NO.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.223
- GOT YOU SOME COFFEE.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.591
- OH, THANKS.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.873
- IT WAS SHORT.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.309
IT WAS SHORT.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.911
I REMEMBER IT WAS CURLY,

19:04.944 --> 19:07.647
'CAUSE IT WAS RAINING OUT.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.616
AND IT WAS LIGHTER
THAN IT IS NOW,

19:09.649 --> 19:13.286
BUT I REMEMBER IT WAS SHORT.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.688
- OH, RAY.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.889
NO.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.568
- I TOOK A SHOT.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.506
COME ON; WHY HAS THIS TEST
GOTTEN YOU SO UPSET?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.775
- I JUST THOUGHT
I KNEW WHO WE WERE,

19:35.808 --> 19:38.978
LIKE AS A COUPLE.

19:39.011 --> 19:43.316
YOU KNOW, OUR STRENGTHS,
OUR WEAKNESSES AND--

19:43.350 --> 19:44.984
LOOK AT ME.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.519
YOU GOT TO KNOW DEEP DOWN

19:46.553 --> 19:48.755
THAT I'M SMARTER THAN YOU,
DON'T YOU?

19:51.358 --> 19:53.626
- LOOK, IF IT WAS UP TO ME,
I'D BE AS DUMB AS A POST,

19:53.660 --> 19:56.696
BUT NUMBERS DON'T LIE.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.468
- HEY.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.735
BUSY?

20:05.472 --> 20:06.939
- WHAT, ROBERT?

20:06.973 --> 20:09.342
- WELL, YOU KNOW
THAT I.Q. TEST I GAVE YOU?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.777
- YEAH. YEAH.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.512
- WELL, THOSE WEREN'T
YOUR REAL SCORES.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.913
- WHAT?

20:13.946 --> 20:15.882
- WHOSE SCORES WERE THEY?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.417
- WELL, I HAD TO SET YOU UP.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.818
HEY, POP TART.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.555
- YOU SET US UP?

20:22.589 --> 20:24.291
- I HAD TO DO IT
FOR THE CREDIT.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.392
I MEAN, I COULDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT IT,

20:25.425 --> 20:26.926
'CAUSE THAT WAS PART
OF THE CLASS,

20:26.959 --> 20:29.762
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
I WOULDN'T GET THE CREDIT.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.600
- WE WERE FOR CREDIT.
- MM-HMM.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.002
BUT, SEE, THE REAL TEST
WAS ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.637
YOU KNOW, LIKE HOW
A SUSPECT WOULD ACT

20:37.670 --> 20:39.972
IF YOU MESSED
WITH HIS SELF-IMAGE.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.409
- WE'RE NOT SUSPECTS.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.277
- OF COURSE NOT.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.278
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU

20:45.312 --> 20:46.679
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, SIR.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.320
- WAIT A MINUTE.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.055
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING--
YOU MADE UP THE SCORES?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.457
- YEAH.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.558
- AND THEN
YOU SWITCHED THEM AROUND

20:58.591 --> 21:00.293
TO SEE
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.828
- YEAH.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.335
D-D-DID YOU TURN
ON EACH OTHER?

21:08.368 --> 21:10.737
- ROBERT, WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING
FOR THREE DAYS!

21:10.770 --> 21:11.871
- OKAY, WAIT,
I GOT TO GET THAT DOWN.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.873
I GOT TO FILL
A FIVE-PAGE PAPER.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.808
- I HAD TO SLEEP
ON THE COUCH LAST NIGHT.

21:15.842 --> 21:16.809
- OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.845
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WORKED.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.349
- NO, ROBERT,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO PEOPLE.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.951
- OKAY, WAIT,
A LITTLE SLOWER.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.018
- WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.687
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.723
SO I'M NOT SMARTER THAN HER?

21:30.757 --> 21:32.959
- I'D BE VERY SURPRISED.

21:42.435 --> 21:47.574
- GOOD MORNING.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.410
- MA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

21:50.443 --> 21:52.044
- WE TOOK THE TEST.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.548
- WHAT HAPPENED?

21:55.582 --> 21:57.384
- WELL--

22:12.465 --> 22:13.366
- UH...

22:13.400 --> 22:16.736
LISTEN, MOM, DAD,
ABOUT THE TEST RESULTS.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.639
I THINK I MAY HAVE
JUMBLED THEM.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.907
- JUMBLED?

22:20.940 --> 22:23.676
- YEAH, MAYBE MADE A MISTAKE
WITH THE COLUMNS.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.445
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT
OVER AT THE HOUSE.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.813
I THINK I MIXED--
I MIXED AND MATCHED THEM.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.381
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.419
EXTRA CREDIT.
